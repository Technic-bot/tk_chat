26-06-2020T00:01:10,Dadrobit,"Wait, no, I was with kame the other day. He was debating the value of pants in regards to proximity of ring based upper attire!"
26-06-2020T00:01:44,Dadrobit,While drawing a dragon lady looking to the left.
26-06-2020T00:01:57,AspiringNoodle,"Errr, whenever it was they played Terraria"

26-06-2020T00:05:45,Dadrobit,He could probably do it for a living!
26-06-2020T00:05:58,Ordithus,the very idea
26-06-2020T00:07:26,Dadrobit,But then he'd have to give up on his lifelong dream of becoming a radiologist!
26-06-2020T00:07:39,AspiringNoodle,Radiology is for nerds
26-06-2020T00:07:46,AspiringNoodle,Tom is clearly not a nerd!
26-06-2020T00:07:53,BadFoMo,He isn't?
26-06-2020T00:08:31,Ordithus,This expression
26-06-2020T00:09:20,Dadrobit,Moderate irritation I believe fits.
26-06-2020T00:14:11,ZRO4825,That is the look of a man who refuses to admit that he is irritated.
26-06-2020T00:15:01,Dadrobit,"That's me when a client calls up to my guard house and says, ""Hey, can you just go ahead and let anyone in? Thanks bud!"""

26-06-2020T00:53:39,AspiringNoodle,Hi Rima~
26-06-2020T00:53:56,RimaDraws,Hey
26-06-2020T00:54:10,AspiringNoodle,Well shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiz
26-06-2020T00:54:29,AspiringNoodle,I didn't think the US would break 40k cases in a single day so soon... I was expecting new cases to drop a bit then shoot up
26-06-2020T00:54:35,AspiringNoodle,But nope 24 - 26
26-06-2020T00:54:45,RimaDraws,Yea it broke record in some places
26-06-2020T00:55:19,AspiringNoodle,"37,945 -> 38,853 -> 44,726"
26-06-2020T00:55:26,AspiringNoodle,And yet my parent's still don't give a shit >_>
26-06-2020T00:55:44,AspiringNoodle,"""Number of cases doesn't mean number of deaths.""  And that is an exact quote"
26-06-2020T00:56:08,AspiringNoodle,"And I just thought of the perfect retort right now... ""More cases equals more deaths."""
26-06-2020T00:57:00,SageSaga,it just means we are likely to hit our cap- people will start dying - hospitals will fill up - then people who dont have covid will start dying because of other issues and theres no room or doctors to help them
26-06-2020T00:58:06,AspiringNoodle,I feel like I'm eventually gonna start binging all the info surrounding covid
26-06-2020T00:58:34,AspiringNoodle,"And then when it gets out of hand and I quit retail because honestly, the money is not worth the chance of death"
26-06-2020T00:58:50,AspiringNoodle,I can honestly defend my position with all the info at anyone's disposal :/
26-06-2020T00:59:28,AspiringNoodle,"Also, you don't even need to die.  If COVID puts you in a ventilator, that can have lifelong repercussions"
26-06-2020T00:59:31,SageSaga,here's my problem- i can have all the latest info on covid- but the people who i need to tell dont believe in facts anymore so it's a mute point
26-06-2020T01:00:09,AspiringNoodle,The people who get hooked up to a ventilator and only have to deal with rehab are the lucky ones
26-06-2020T01:00:12,ZRO4825,moot*
26-06-2020T01:00:16,AspiringNoodle,Also ^
26-06-2020T01:00:36,SageSaga,nah its mute because they dont even hear it O_O

26-06-2020T01:01:02,AspiringNoodle,I'm not sure how my state will fare
26-06-2020T01:01:14,AspiringNoodle,My county in particular went green last friday
26-06-2020T01:01:35,MatyMaty,Wasn't there a video of people in Palm Beach saying how using facemasks was against God? :P
26-06-2020T01:01:38,AspiringNoodle,"On the 17th, we had only 335 new cases"
26-06-2020T01:01:49,SageSaga,omg Maty it was horrible T_T
26-06-2020T01:01:51,Ordithus,"yeah, or something like that, maty"
26-06-2020T01:02:07,SageSaga,"one of them called breathing ""Gods beautiful method of breathing"""
26-06-2020T01:02:24,AspiringNoodle,"So, here's the new case counts for the last 3 days in my state"
26-06-2020T01:02:25,Ordithus,how trying to not spread disease became divisive
26-06-2020T01:02:29,AspiringNoodle,495 - 579 - 600
26-06-2020T01:03:24,AspiringNoodle,"Thanks to hazard pay and federal student loans being frozen, my bank account built up quite a bit"
26-06-2020T01:03:50,AspiringNoodle,Still would've been nice if the government compensated essential employees who have to deal with the stupidity -3-
26-06-2020T01:04:20,ZRO4825,"I've been considered essential the whole time. Ain't gotten compensated for shit other than being worked harder and longer hours, lol."
26-06-2020T01:04:38,AspiringNoodle,Same here.  It's gotten to the point where I don't care anymore.
26-06-2020T01:04:49,AspiringNoodle,I tried keeping up with the sanitization routine corporate wants us to do
26-06-2020T01:04:49,Ordithus,"I'm in the weird position of being ""essential"" but can (must) work from home"
26-06-2020T01:05:02,AspiringNoodle,"But all it meant was I worked nonstop all shift every shift, never took breaks, and never got everything done"
26-06-2020T01:05:05,ZRO4825,"I'm hitting that point. Everyone in my store's pretty much aggravated and I'm just tired of dealing with everyone's shit, lol"
26-06-2020T01:05:20,AspiringNoodle,"So, ngl, I stopped sanitizing"
26-06-2020T01:05:34,AspiringNoodle,"I cleaned like normal, but screw the extended list"
26-06-2020T01:05:42,ZRO4825,"We're still running the same skeleton crew we've always been. If someone gets sick, they get to keep working or call off and screw the rest of the crew per normal."
26-06-2020T01:06:07,AspiringNoodle,"Also, getting pretty tired of working here"
26-06-2020T01:06:15,ZRO4825,"I've tried to follow everything in the ""new"" processes I can, but there just isn't enough time considering we've got all the new stuff we're supposed to do, AND we're busy AF."
26-06-2020T01:06:26,AspiringNoodle,Every month or so it seems like they have some new form of training that needs to be completed
26-06-2020T01:06:56,AspiringNoodle,"It's a flipping gas station, how much training do you really need?"
26-06-2020T01:07:14,ZRO4825,I actually like my job itself. But I'm really sick of about half to 2/3 of my coworkers.
26-06-2020T01:07:17,AspiringNoodle,"And if we really need all this constant training, pay us more!"
26-06-2020T01:08:00,AspiringNoodle,"Also, 2nd shift is officially at the point where we *need* a third person on shift"
26-06-2020T01:08:00,MatyMaty,"ZRO, covid doesn't exist. It is a socialist lie made up by the NWO to take away your guns and bibles"
26-06-2020T01:08:16,AspiringNoodle,And I'm getting tired of only having 2
26-06-2020T01:08:30,ZRO4825,"I got one gun, and can't remember the last time I saw my bible.  What do? o_o"
26-06-2020T01:08:40,MatyMaty,buy another

26-06-2020T01:09:13,MatyMaty,from Infowars or WND preferably

26-06-2020T01:12:46,MatyMaty,so the pizzas actually went out the box

26-06-2020T01:23:40,AspiringNoodle,I work retail and have to deal with everyone around me downplaying COVID or constantly moving the goalposts
26-06-2020T01:23:55,MatyMaty,last morning the city's attorney general was ambushed by a squad of cartel gunmen. He survived but several bystanders died. Now they are trying to catch the guys who managed to escape.
26-06-2020T01:24:09,AspiringNoodle,I think I'm entitled to obsess over the pandemic running rampant :ptv-pouty:
26-06-2020T01:24:25,MatyMaty,This is the guns they were used and the car after the ambush. https://i1.wp.com/www.sopitas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Atentado-omar-garcia-harfuch-ssc-cdmx-sheinbaum-420x237.jpg
26-06-2020T01:24:46,MatyMaty,I guess that is the one downside of having a weak police force
26-06-2020T01:25:04,Sirdan87,Sheesh
26-06-2020T01:25:35,MatyMaty,"they used barret submachine guns, even"

26-06-2020T01:26:28,AspiringNoodle,How much human contact do you deal with at your job?
26-06-2020T01:27:09,Sirdan87,We try to retain Social Distancing. It can be a challenge at times in mods.
26-06-2020T01:27:28,AspiringNoodle,"Because I work at a gas station, and I have to deal with hundreds of people in a shift"

26-06-2020T01:28:43,AspiringNoodle,Maybe the US shoudl start lending out the surplus military equipment to countries that actually need it
26-06-2020T01:28:55,AspiringNoodle,Instead of to police departments that look for any chance to use it...
26-06-2020T01:30:04,AspiringNoodle,I hope they catch those bastards

26-06-2020T01:33:14,ZRO4825,"If it's following rules, there's still supposed to be background checks being done."

26-06-2020T01:33:54,ZRO4825,"Problem is that 1) Some people feel like rules are too hard to follow, and 2) Sometimes shit gets fabricated and through the system anyway. :c"
26-06-2020T01:33:56,AspiringNoodle,Any purchases from a FFL dealers need to go through extra steps to approve the sale
26-06-2020T01:34:09,MatyMaty,IIRC they mostly do it in like Texas and Arizona
26-06-2020T01:34:21,MatyMaty,or that is what the news say here
26-06-2020T01:34:24,ZRO4825,"Those would be the closest states, so that'd make sense."
26-06-2020T01:34:26,AspiringNoodle,Those states might not have a requirement for private transfers to be done through FFL's
26-06-2020T01:36:21,AspiringNoodle,"While the US may have silly / downright arbitrary limits on firearms, there are also some blatantly illogical loopholes in acquiring them in the first place"
26-06-2020T01:36:55,ZRO4825,"Many of which a number of US peeps even look at and go ""Uh, 'scuse me wtf?"""
26-06-2020T01:37:17,AspiringNoodle,"For me, the biggest one would be states where private transfers don't need to go through a licensed dealer"
26-06-2020T01:37:37,AspiringNoodle,That's a blatant loophole that can allow someone who shouldn't have one to get a gun
26-06-2020T01:37:45,ZRO4825,Yup.
26-06-2020T01:38:09,SageSaga,for guns they go to the shows- have legal people buy them with background checks - and then they give them to the smugglers
26-06-2020T01:38:20,SageSaga,if yall didnt already say all that
26-06-2020T01:38:26,AspiringNoodle,Now that's straight up straw purchase
26-06-2020T01:38:32,SageSaga,its what they do
26-06-2020T01:38:40,AspiringNoodle,And the people making the purchases need to be jailed
26-06-2020T01:38:40,SageSaga,its not legal but gunshows make it easier for them
26-06-2020T01:40:21,ZRO4825,Sadly true
26-06-2020T01:42:05,Sirdan87,I'm gonna head off. Take it easy folks.
26-06-2020T01:42:12,AspiringNoodle,Night Sir Dan <3
26-06-2020T01:42:19,Sirdan87,Keep up the good work Sage.
26-06-2020T01:42:33,AspiringNoodle,"Oh yeah, haven't told you guys yet"
26-06-2020T01:42:48,AspiringNoodle,"I got to work on day a week or two ago, there was a pamphlet for skill slots in the register area, lol"
26-06-2020T01:43:35,AspiringNoodle,"Advertising that it's 100% legal, and if you get the machine installed, the profits will be split 60 - 40.  60% to the store, 40% to the provider"
26-06-2020T01:43:54,AspiringNoodle,"And I'm just like, ""They install this, I'm out."""
26-06-2020T01:44:14,ZRO4825,Skill slots?
26-06-2020T01:44:19,ZRO4825,"Like, gambling slots machine?"
26-06-2020T01:44:36,AspiringNoodle,Yeah.  But less random and the outcomes are more user-determined
26-06-2020T01:45:08,ZRO4825,ahhh
26-06-2020T01:45:23,AspiringNoodle,I'm already pretty pissed off about the state lottery being open this entire time
26-06-2020T01:45:39,AspiringNoodle,That would be crossing the line for me
26-06-2020T01:45:42,ZRO4825,"Well, yeah, you can't deny the gambling addicts their fix <_<;;"
26-06-2020T01:48:10,AspiringNoodle,I don't care if they ruin themselve at the casino (okay I care a little)
26-06-2020T01:48:27,AspiringNoodle,"But shoving their addiction in their face everywhere else, that's just unethical"
26-06-2020T01:49:02,AspiringNoodle,"Also, I think my state might have a gambling problem..."
26-06-2020T01:49:22,AspiringNoodle,"I've heard that lotto machines are used constantly, they can overheat and shut down"
26-06-2020T01:49:42,AspiringNoodle,"And I'm fairly certain that would happen at my store, even with the decrease in demand after replacing hand-picking with a machine"
26-06-2020T01:52:20,AspiringNoodle,Bobs :eyes:
26-06-2020T01:52:23,MatyMaty,Gambling huh
26-06-2020T01:53:04,MatyMaty,It reminds me I know someone who has spent like $5000 on gacha since like 2018
26-06-2020T01:53:10,MatyMaty,mostly on Fate GO
26-06-2020T01:53:14,ZRO4825,oof
26-06-2020T01:53:20,AspiringNoodle,That sounds pretty standard for the course
26-06-2020T01:53:40,MatyMaty,he once spent $800 just to get a swimsuit Nero
26-06-2020T01:53:44,ZRO4825,I've spent all said and told over the last like 8 years MAYBE 200 on gatcha game crap.
26-06-2020T01:53:53,AspiringNoodle,"I have a regular who will come in and every once in a while, play anywhere from $100 - $300 in a single night"
26-06-2020T01:54:01,ZRO4825,oof
26-06-2020T01:54:13,ZRO4825,I think I'd rather throw my money at Sage or Maty :joy:
26-06-2020T01:54:28,AspiringNoodle,"While obviously the jackpot is what he's looking for, he's also looking for the smaller handouts in the $100 - $200 range"
26-06-2020T01:54:38,AspiringNoodle,Something where he either breaks even or makes a small profit
26-06-2020T01:55:37,AspiringNoodle,"But state lottery, aka printed tickets or scratch lottery (aka ""scratch-offs"" / ""scratchies"") are mostly played by either A) The poor, people who can least afford to play but stand to gain the most"
26-06-2020T01:55:48,AspiringNoodle,Or B) The elderly with tons of disposable income and nothing else to do
26-06-2020T01:55:50,MatyMaty,You could have gotten ONE Miles DF commission with that XD
26-06-2020T01:55:57,ZRO4825,"I throw like $2-4 at Powerball on random occasions if I have a couple spare dollars running around after a shift. I figure I can spend it on that or a snack, and really that's about as useful. :rofl:"
26-06-2020T01:56:17,ZRO4825,"Maty, you're lowballing, I'd have to be a very VERY background character to get a Miles slot for that much. :P"
26-06-2020T01:56:28,ZRO4825,"Like, in a picture on the wall or something. :rofl:"
26-06-2020T01:57:04,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, I *love* tom's monetization approach"
26-06-2020T01:57:32,AspiringNoodle,Smaller amount of money to suggest something to be drawn / vote on it
26-06-2020T01:57:46,AspiringNoodle,And then the larger Nora Card if you want to hand-pick something to get the works
26-06-2020T01:57:56,ZRO4825,Nora Card is no more. :P
26-06-2020T01:58:02,AspiringNoodle,For now
26-06-2020T01:58:04,MatyMaty,"yus, Tom is no paywall"
26-06-2020T01:58:11,ZRO4825,Hopefully it stays that way tbh.
26-06-2020T01:58:13,AspiringNoodle,"Tom know's the pain of backlogs, lol"
26-06-2020T01:58:25,AspiringNoodle,knows* gdamn I am overusing apostrophes tonight
26-06-2020T01:58:44,AspiringNoodle,But I also understand some artists wanting to commission work
26-06-2020T01:59:02,AspiringNoodle,You can control the flow at which you receive work
26-06-2020T01:59:13,AspiringNoodle,You can put a dollar value on how much work goes into it
26-06-2020T01:59:41,MatyMaty,but  the furry fandom has too many people with more money than sense
26-06-2020T02:00:11,MatyMaty,"I mean there was that one guy who bought expensive adopts from popular artists just to ""feed"" them to his OC in vore art"
26-06-2020T02:00:24,neropan,Heyo
26-06-2020T02:00:26,MatyMaty,and make sure they weren't drawn ever again
26-06-2020T02:00:27,AspiringNoodle,Hi :D
26-06-2020T02:00:56,neropan,:ptv-greetings:
26-06-2020T02:01:10,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, that's the artists' problem"
26-06-2020T02:01:11,ZRO4825,"I heard 'bout that one too, Maty, and I just kinda went ""Uh...okay..."""
26-06-2020T02:01:11,MatyMaty,Hey Nero
26-06-2020T02:01:23,ZRO4825,Heyyo Nero
26-06-2020T02:01:43,AspiringNoodle,"Personally, I wouldn't sell my adopts to people like that"
26-06-2020T02:01:55,MatyMaty,Yeah
26-06-2020T02:01:59,AspiringNoodle,I think I am more on the kemono side of furry culture rather than western
26-06-2020T02:02:04,neropan,Hope yall chilling nicely
26-06-2020T02:02:20,AspiringNoodle,Just discussing how artists make money~
26-06-2020T02:02:30,ZRO4825,"I'm on both sides of it. I like the furry stuff, and I like the -mimi and human stuffs~"
26-06-2020T02:02:32,MatyMaty,What is the kemono side? I've always wondered what's exactly the difference
26-06-2020T02:02:36,AspiringNoodle,Tom has the most consumer friendly model where nothing is paywalled and people willingly throw money at him
26-06-2020T02:02:41,MatyMaty,since there's even a kemono tag at e621
26-06-2020T02:02:48,AspiringNoodle,"Uh, there was a tweet I found somewhere"
26-06-2020T02:02:50,ZRO4825,"Kemonomimis, catgirls, like what Sage does~"
26-06-2020T02:02:59,ZRO4825,"And various other animal types, but still~"
26-06-2020T02:03:04,AspiringNoodle,Best explanation is that western furry culture is mostly about self-representation
26-06-2020T02:03:04,MatyMaty,I don't think that's it. Zro
26-06-2020T02:03:08,ZRO4825,No?
26-06-2020T02:03:11,AspiringNoodle,"Fursonas, fur-suits, etc"
26-06-2020T02:03:16,ZRO4825,Guess I'm missing something too then.
26-06-2020T02:03:24,AspiringNoodle,"You have a character, but it's some kind of represenation of the self"
26-06-2020T02:03:26,neropan,"Oh money talk, i can only talk pickle"
26-06-2020T02:03:31,MatyMaty,check the kemono tag at e621
26-06-2020T02:03:35,AspiringNoodle,"In kemono furry culture, the characters are more like family"
26-06-2020T02:03:47,MatyMaty,oh
26-06-2020T02:03:54,AspiringNoodle,"They are their own person, but you care for them"
26-06-2020T02:04:16,ZRO4825,hands Nero a pickle.
26-06-2020T02:04:26,MatyMaty,pickle
26-06-2020T02:04:29,MatyMaty,why
26-06-2020T02:04:41,ZRO4825,"Okay, I see the stuff in the tag. Looks like furry stuff to me. O.o"
26-06-2020T02:04:56,ZRO4825,"idk, ask Nero, he said he only talks pickle. So I give him a pickle."
26-06-2020T02:05:00,MatyMaty,see? that's why it confused me XD
26-06-2020T02:05:09,neropan,Which is a fair transition yea
26-06-2020T02:05:18,ZRO4825,"Count me as confused then too, because furry stuffs is furry stuffs."
26-06-2020T02:05:19,AspiringNoodle,"Anywho, as far as monetization is concerned, paywalling is a bit complicated"
26-06-2020T02:05:28,MatyMaty,pickle https://dynamicmedia.zuza.com/zz/m/original_/7/a/7a5d4238-f737-43fd-9f98-13d94ce3ac81/IMG%205531_Super_Portrait.jpg
26-06-2020T02:05:32,AspiringNoodle,It's a way for you to guarantee money if people want to see your content
26-06-2020T02:05:43,AspiringNoodle,But at the same time can prevent people from even getting into your content in the first place
26-06-2020T02:05:44,ZRO4825,...is that pickle flavored ice cream?
26-06-2020T02:05:49,MatyMaty,Yup Zro
26-06-2020T02:05:53,AspiringNoodle,Yup
26-06-2020T02:05:56,AspiringNoodle,Japan is a hell of a drug
26-06-2020T02:05:56,ZRO4825,Huh...interesting. I'd try it.
26-06-2020T02:06:02,ZRO4825,Maybe minus the flakey stuffs.
26-06-2020T02:06:06,neropan,Maty thats cursed
26-06-2020T02:06:09,neropan,I like it
26-06-2020T02:06:10,MatyMaty,There's ranch dressing too
26-06-2020T02:06:12,AspiringNoodle,Japan has wasabi ice cream
26-06-2020T02:06:17,MatyMaty,and clam chowder
26-06-2020T02:06:28,MatyMaty,ice creams
26-06-2020T02:06:29,ZRO4825,I'll pass on the ranch. Ranch does terrible things to my digestive system anymore. XD
26-06-2020T02:06:36,neropan,I mean why not
26-06-2020T02:06:50,MatyMaty,I say
26-06-2020T02:06:57,MatyMaty,Try everything at least once
26-06-2020T02:07:28,ZRO4825,"I'd agree. Now if I could just bring myself to try Sushi. I want to, but every time I find it anywhere my first thought is ""Okay, yeah, no, not trusting sushi from HERE"" lmao"
26-06-2020T02:07:42,neropan,Sushi nice
26-06-2020T02:07:45,MatyMaty,Buy a full salmon
26-06-2020T02:07:49,MatyMaty,then eat it raw
26-06-2020T02:07:50,AspiringNoodle,There's a restaurant near me that I tried sushi at
26-06-2020T02:07:54,neropan,Consume the salmon
26-06-2020T02:07:55,AspiringNoodle,Was amazing~
26-06-2020T02:08:03,ZRO4825,"That sounds like a terrible idea to me, Maty, lol"
26-06-2020T02:08:03,AspiringNoodle,But smoked salmon too strong for newbie
26-06-2020T02:08:12,MatyMaty,raw salmon > cooked salmon
26-06-2020T02:08:18,MatyMaty,not being ironic at all
26-06-2020T02:08:50,MatyMaty,although I guess with the covid you wanna cook everything throughly
26-06-2020T02:09:02,ZRO4825,"That, and honestly, much as I want to try it, with the way I was raised, the idea of eating any meat raw just gives me the heebie-jeebies, lol"
26-06-2020T02:09:17,AspiringNoodle,"I like sushi, lol"
26-06-2020T02:09:23,AspiringNoodle,The only thing that throws me off is the texture
26-06-2020T02:09:23,MatyMaty,I love sushi
26-06-2020T02:09:35,MatyMaty,both real sushi and USA sushi
26-06-2020T02:09:38,AspiringNoodle,"Flavor, fine.  But the texture, combined with the size of what I'm eating throws me for a loop"
26-06-2020T02:09:40,neropan,Sushi nice = v =
26-06-2020T02:09:42,SageSaga,ive never had Sushi
26-06-2020T02:09:45,ZRO4825,"I got friends from Germany who told me about mett, and the idea is just....ugh, lol"
26-06-2020T02:09:51,MatyMaty,carpaccio
26-06-2020T02:09:59,MatyMaty,is very thin raw beef
26-06-2020T02:10:00,MatyMaty,yum
26-06-2020T02:10:08,AspiringNoodle,*slaps Sage with a raw salmon*
26-06-2020T02:10:12,neropan,It guud too
26-06-2020T02:10:13,AspiringNoodle,"There, you've been sushi'd"
26-06-2020T02:10:16,neropan,Cow sushi
26-06-2020T02:10:20,ZRO4825,Mett is a type of uncooked pork creation in Germany
26-06-2020T02:10:24,MatyMaty,I've had steak sushi
26-06-2020T02:10:25,SageSaga,but most of the reason ive never had it is because my body doesnt seem to like fish at all
26-06-2020T02:10:30,MatyMaty,the steak was cooked tho
26-06-2020T02:10:47,MatyMaty,huh
26-06-2020T02:10:48,neropan,Gyuudon
26-06-2020T02:10:51,MatyMaty,uncooked pork
26-06-2020T02:10:54,MatyMaty,really?
26-06-2020T02:10:58,MatyMaty,that sounds bad :P
26-06-2020T02:10:58,ZRO4825,Yar
26-06-2020T02:11:02,ZRO4825,That's what I said!!
26-06-2020T02:11:11,MatyMaty,pork and chicken should always be cooked
26-06-2020T02:11:34,AspiringNoodle,Chris Broad-san would agree with that
26-06-2020T02:11:48,AspiringNoodle,"ALRIGHT EVERYONE, WE'RE GOING TO JAPAN FOR FAMILYMART FRIED CHICKEN!!!"
26-06-2020T02:12:13,MatyMaty,lol
26-06-2020T02:12:24,MatyMaty,raw fish is nice tho
26-06-2020T02:12:30,MatyMaty,beef tartare
26-06-2020T02:12:30,ZRO4825,"But yeah, mett is apparently minced raw pork that's prepared, then pretty much just like spread on bread or something."
26-06-2020T02:12:36,MatyMaty,raw shirmp too
26-06-2020T02:12:48,ZRO4825,"And my american brain is just looking at that going ""That's not safe. Why would you do this?"" lol"
26-06-2020T02:12:54,MatyMaty,yeah XD
26-06-2020T02:13:00,MatyMaty,I wouldn't try it
26-06-2020T02:13:02,ZRO4825,"But apparently it is, since it's pretty common over there."
26-06-2020T02:13:16,MatyMaty,and I've had weird stuff before
26-06-2020T02:13:56,AspiringNoodle,I've had burgers with glazed doughnuts for buns
26-06-2020T02:14:01,AspiringNoodle,And a PB&J burger
26-06-2020T02:14:04,MatyMaty,"I've had alligator, armadillo, iguana, frog, snake and horse meats"
26-06-2020T02:14:05,AspiringNoodle,I'm all for the weird shite
26-06-2020T02:14:13,ZRO4825,"Okay, see, I could see that working Noodle, but it just doesn't sound good, lol"
26-06-2020T02:14:17,MatyMaty,most taste like either chicken or pork
26-06-2020T02:14:24,AspiringNoodle,"ZRO, you gotta try it,lol"
26-06-2020T02:14:36,AspiringNoodle,Those two burgers have survived *multiple* menu changes at this sports bar
26-06-2020T02:14:53,ZRO4825,lol
26-06-2020T02:14:58,MatyMaty,fff is 2:14 AM and now I am hungry :ptv-whiny:
26-06-2020T02:15:07,AspiringNoodle,Have a :cookie: :ptv-hearts:
26-06-2020T02:15:27,MatyMaty,cookies are not food...
26-06-2020T02:15:30,MatyMaty,they are dessert
26-06-2020T02:16:04,AspiringNoodle,*loads cookie cannon*
26-06-2020T02:16:10,AspiringNoodle,You sure you want to die on that hill? @w@
26-06-2020T02:16:17,ZRO4825,Maty is not wrong.

26-06-2020T02:17:51,MatyMaty,just bread and butter in between
26-06-2020T02:18:02,AspiringNoodle,Depends on how much butter we're talking about
26-06-2020T02:18:06,ZRO4825,that makes a great snack sometimes damnit. :joy:

26-06-2020T02:19:49,ZRO4825,Huh....I stand by my statement.
26-06-2020T02:31:23,SageSaga,oh i finished the new Ascendance of a Bookworm book-
26-06-2020T02:31:38,SageSaga,and started another book already too- its been pretty good
26-06-2020T02:31:48,ZRO4825,"Oh yeah, I need to pick that back up. Started up the first ep and got sidetracked about 2/3 in, lol"
26-06-2020T02:31:50,SageSaga,its about a guy who became his max level D&D Wizard character
26-06-2020T02:31:56,ZRO4825,o.o;
26-06-2020T02:32:54,SageSaga,its a bit unfortunate for him because well - the world he in doesnt have wizards- just sorcerers- and magic is not sorcery
26-06-2020T02:33:04,ZRO4825,"Oh dear, lol"
26-06-2020T02:33:13,SageSaga,so all the like dispel magic and protection from spells stuff doesnt protect him from sorcery
26-06-2020T02:33:30,SageSaga,however- it seem the deamons of the world are somehow related to Magic
26-06-2020T02:34:07,ZRO4825,"Oh...that usually has bad implications, lol"
26-06-2020T02:37:19,SageSaga,this group of daemon hunters came to him thinking he was working with  the daemons- and they had a device to detect their influence
26-06-2020T02:37:54,SageSaga,it was a crystal ball with a bit of daemon blood inside of it - when it detects someone working with them it turns red and calls to them for help-
26-06-2020T02:38:40,SageSaga,"to a normal person it does nothing- but to the Mage- they were like ""What is it doing? Is it- afraid? In my 500 years ive never seen a Daemon exhibit fear"""
26-06-2020T02:39:13,SageSaga,"and im just like ""Yeeeeessssss! This is so anime power trip it's delicious"""

26-06-2020T02:39:21,AspiringNoodle,I wanna reaaaaaaaaad
26-06-2020T02:40:21,SageSaga,you could probably figure it out-
26-06-2020T02:40:29,SageSaga,it's a classic title scheme-
26-06-2020T02:40:37,SageSaga,Magic User: Reborn in Another World as a Max Level Wizard (Light Novel)

26-06-2020T02:45:02,AspiringNoodle,But I watched the entire Familiar of Zero series and liked it

26-06-2020T02:49:27,MatyMaty,I always found .Hack to be super boring
26-06-2020T02:49:35,AspiringNoodle,"Haven't watched it, can't say"
26-06-2020T02:50:01,SageSaga,.hack is boring- but i loved it anyways
26-06-2020T02:50:06,AspiringNoodle,Have you watched One Punch Man? :)
26-06-2020T02:50:09,SageSaga,it was way too slow
26-06-2020T02:50:09,ZRO4825,I can see where it could be boring to people.
26-06-2020T02:50:10,AspiringNoodle,"If I'm ever bored, I watch it"
26-06-2020T02:50:14,MatyMaty,that is not an Isekai XD
26-06-2020T02:50:18,AspiringNoodle,I know :c
26-06-2020T02:50:23,AspiringNoodle,But is so good~

26-06-2020T02:50:39,ZRO4825,I won't fight that.
26-06-2020T02:50:40,SageSaga,i will
26-06-2020T02:50:51,MatyMaty,Sage
26-06-2020T02:50:52,SageSaga,SAOA >SAO x100
26-06-2020T02:50:54,AspiringNoodle,Agreed except for Alfheim
26-06-2020T02:51:01,AspiringNoodle,We don't discuss Alfheim
26-06-2020T02:51:15,MatyMaty,no matter what you think of SAO
26-06-2020T02:51:16,SageSaga,also i probably wouldnt be here without .Hack btw
26-06-2020T02:51:30,MatyMaty,Swordland/Gunland/Find your Sword in This Land
26-06-2020T02:51:33,ZRO4825,"Honestly, I think Alfheim was fine except for the antagonist. Ye gods I could've done without him ever, lol"
26-06-2020T02:51:34,MatyMaty,make up for it
26-06-2020T02:51:36,SageSaga,i got my start with comics on a .hack board
26-06-2020T02:52:00,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, the whole dynamic kinda ruined the arc"
26-06-2020T02:52:10,AspiringNoodle,"That said, glad the douchebag got what was coming to him"
26-06-2020T02:52:20,SageSaga,SAO Abridged is amazing
26-06-2020T02:52:28,MatyMaty,"But hey, you were right about the mom Isekai"
26-06-2020T02:52:30,AspiringNoodle,Especially since Kirito effed with the settings so he felt EVERYTHING and had physical damage from it
26-06-2020T02:52:32,MatyMaty,it was TERRIBLE
26-06-2020T02:52:34,ZRO4825,"That being a point, to a certain extent, I rather enjoyed a straight-forward villain BEING a villain."
26-06-2020T02:52:36,SageSaga,it was horrible T_T
26-06-2020T02:52:40,SageSaga,sooo bad
26-06-2020T02:52:45,SageSaga,even for fan service it sucked
26-06-2020T02:52:51,MatyMaty,"It was like ""oh god stop please"""
26-06-2020T02:53:02,AspiringNoodle,Hmmm
26-06-2020T02:53:07,AspiringNoodle,Have you guys watched Angel Beats! ?
26-06-2020T02:53:11,ZRO4825,"From what all I saw, the bestthing about the Mom Isekai was the Mom. :rofl:"
26-06-2020T02:53:12,MatyMaty,Nope
26-06-2020T02:53:13,SageSaga,Ascendance of a Bookworm though is top tier
26-06-2020T02:53:14,AspiringNoodle,I think that kinda counts as an isekai :P
26-06-2020T02:53:31,SageSaga,the mom was a bad mom
26-06-2020T02:53:44,SageSaga,the son was a bad son too
26-06-2020T02:53:45,MatyMaty,The mom was the worst part
26-06-2020T02:53:50,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, if you watch Angel Beats!, prepare to cry. A lot."
26-06-2020T02:54:03,MatyMaty,she was so dumb and childish
26-06-2020T02:54:17,MatyMaty,"and all the ""Nooo, don't look at mommy's underwear!"""
26-06-2020T02:54:18,AspiringNoodle,The whole premise is that the anime takes place in a sort of afterlife for young people who died tragic deaths
26-06-2020T02:54:20,MatyMaty,was so bad
26-06-2020T02:54:24,SageSaga,yeah and her powers were all about being a great mother even though she wasnt close
26-06-2020T02:54:40,ZRO4825,"Okay, the don't look at the underwear is just a thing Japan in general needs to stop doing imo, lol"
26-06-2020T02:54:53,MatyMaty,"I Don't Want to Get Hurt, so I'll Max Out My Defense looks fun"
26-06-2020T02:54:57,AspiringNoodle,^^^
26-06-2020T02:55:01,MatyMaty,dunno how good it actually is
26-06-2020T02:55:09,AspiringNoodle,It makes me think of that one youtube channel
26-06-2020T02:55:28,SageSaga,Bofuri I dont want to get hurt etc was cute and fun
26-06-2020T02:55:36,AspiringNoodle,"They do ""[insert game name] is Perfectly Balanced with Zero Exploits"""

26-06-2020T02:56:26,AspiringNoodle,Let's see: Maximizes defense stats to never take damage - Check
26-06-2020T02:56:31,MatyMaty,but actually
26-06-2020T02:56:37,AspiringNoodle,Invests in passive damage abilities so they never actually fight - Check
26-06-2020T02:56:42,SageSaga,"by the end of it the game creators are like ""Are we just bad at our job?"""
26-06-2020T02:56:43,MatyMaty,I think Overlord might be the best Isekai
26-06-2020T02:56:48,AspiringNoodle,Makes it clear to their group they never want to fight - Check
26-06-2020T02:56:56,SageSaga,Overlord is good but Ascendance is better
26-06-2020T02:57:13,SageSaga,because Ascendance doesnt make me want to smack a skeleton man
26-06-2020T02:57:51,MatyMaty,why? XD he does the best he can with the situation he is in
26-06-2020T02:57:57,ZRO4825,Albedo best part of Overlord. :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
26-06-2020T02:57:58,SageSaga,noooo he doesnt
26-06-2020T02:58:07,MatyMaty,like trying to get humans and monsters to coexist
26-06-2020T02:58:09,SageSaga,he can do so much better with all he has
26-06-2020T02:58:30,SageSaga,i lost all respect for him when he stopped really caring
26-06-2020T02:58:45,MatyMaty,well he's starting to be taken over by his undead nature
26-06-2020T02:59:00,SageSaga,yes but he could be fighting it- hes not- hes accepting it
26-06-2020T02:59:07,SageSaga,that should be his struggle
26-06-2020T02:59:08,MatyMaty,so he becomes les human as time goes by
26-06-2020T02:59:17,SageSaga,and he should fight it but he doesnt
26-06-2020T02:59:31,SageSaga,and he doesnt question the bipedal sheep!
26-06-2020T02:59:43,MatyMaty,lol
26-06-2020T02:59:46,SageSaga,Who would just accept the bipedal sheep!?
26-06-2020T03:00:12,BadFoMo,Carl from ATHF?
26-06-2020T03:00:16,SageSaga,they are litterally tearing the skin off of people over and over as they use magic to regenerate their flesh for making parchment!!!
26-06-2020T03:00:25,MatyMaty,well he doesn't get what it is :P
26-06-2020T03:00:37,MatyMaty,that 0s Demiurge's fault
26-06-2020T03:01:12,SageSaga,Demi will do whatever the boss wants- if he made it known he doesnt want that-
26-06-2020T03:01:16,SageSaga,he would find another way
26-06-2020T03:01:36,SageSaga,honestly- i think Demi needs to go- hes too smart anyways- hes a danger
26-06-2020T03:01:51,MatyMaty,yeah
26-06-2020T03:02:58,SageSaga,"he should just tell everyone - ""Look- i have these memories of being human- i like humans- not all of them- but they poses something i wish i could have- and i want to protect them- not like how a Shepard protects a herd-"
26-06-2020T03:03:05,SageSaga,"but like how a father protects his children"""
26-06-2020T03:03:20,MatyMaty,But he doesn't think of humans as humans
26-06-2020T03:03:25,MatyMaty,but as NPCs
26-06-2020T03:03:43,SageSaga,yet he treats his NPCs as if they are human- which makes no sense
26-06-2020T03:03:50,MatyMaty,that's why he had zero regrets when he summoned the Dark Young
26-06-2020T03:04:12,SageSaga,yeah by that point he wasnt the hero anymore
26-06-2020T03:04:27,SageSaga,and thats why i keep an interest in it- i want to see him defeated by a hero
26-06-2020T03:04:28,ZRO4825,Was he ever really the hero to begin with?
26-06-2020T03:04:40,SageSaga,he had the potential to become it
26-06-2020T03:04:44,SageSaga,and he did do good things
26-06-2020T03:05:09,SageSaga,but no- hes the villain and i wanted a hero story- thats my personal problem
26-06-2020T03:05:35,SageSaga,his potential to make the world amazing was so great- and he squandered it
26-06-2020T03:05:40,MatyMaty,"There was another meme for isekai villain MCs.  One option was like It had a choice that was like ""give all your points for spawning in god mode, but you cannot feel, taste or smell anything ever again, and you slowly lose your sanity because of it"""
26-06-2020T03:05:47,MatyMaty,which imo sounds interesting
26-06-2020T03:06:20,SageSaga,yeah- never give up your humanity
26-06-2020T03:06:48,MatyMaty,It reminds me of that talk we had about super powers a while ago
26-06-2020T03:07:07,SageSaga,mindcontrol is always evil! XD
26-06-2020T03:07:24,MatyMaty,and how I said being able to change people's toughts without them realizing it would be the best
26-06-2020T03:07:29,MatyMaty,and you were like NOOOOO XD
26-06-2020T03:07:40,SageSaga,because its the same thing
26-06-2020T03:08:26,SageSaga,if you force someone to think they like something- their will no longer matters - you take from them one of the only things we as humans see as sacred almost exclusively
26-06-2020T03:08:29,MatyMaty,but you could do good with it!
26-06-2020T03:08:40,SageSaga,there is not a culture in the world ok with taking the will of another
26-06-2020T03:08:43,ZRO4825,Potentially. But the potential for Evil is just as great.
26-06-2020T03:08:47,MatyMaty,you are not forcing them. They wouldn't even realize it happened
26-06-2020T03:09:01,SageSaga,its still force if they didnt want it to begin with
26-06-2020T03:09:31,MatyMaty,well if you are a hero you should be able to have the ethics to not abuse it
26-06-2020T03:09:44,SageSaga,"its like that creepy scene when you meet the wife of a man that beats her and shes like ""oh no- i like getting hit- it reminds me that im beneath him- his work is gods will and who am i to stop him?"""
26-06-2020T03:09:52,SageSaga,and its like- OK! This guy needs to die!
26-06-2020T03:11:02,MatyMaty,but wouldn't super strenght or speed be just as abusable?
26-06-2020T03:11:19,SageSaga,its almost always the same story with mind control like abilities- they get into an argument- get angry and just go - oh- i can just fix this - and then it becomes common place and then everyone is a puppet
26-06-2020T03:12:09,SageSaga,there are weaknesses to super strength and speed- also they cant take the will from a person other than by killing- and then you kill people and others will try to stop you
26-06-2020T03:12:27,SageSaga,so long as you arent immortal too - super speed and strength types can be killed still
26-06-2020T03:12:46,SageSaga,but if you can control minds- no one will be able to stop you- they wont even think of it
26-06-2020T03:13:07,MatyMaty,I'm just saying it would be the most useful superpower :P
26-06-2020T03:13:14,MatyMaty,not that it would be less dangerous
26-06-2020T03:13:34,SageSaga,yeah but its also super scary
26-06-2020T03:14:27,SageSaga,i like Technomancy
26-06-2020T03:14:29,BadFoMo,"""...but if you can control minds- no one will be able to stop you- they wont even think of it."" That just reminded me of Fry and thoes brains from Futurama."
26-06-2020T03:14:35,SageSaga,i could draw so much faster
26-06-2020T03:15:09,SageSaga,yeah you would need an army of unthinking robots to take on a psychic XD
26-06-2020T03:15:27,MatyMaty,create clones and force them to draw 24/ :D
26-06-2020T03:15:34,MatyMaty,24/7
26-06-2020T03:15:53,SageSaga,i could create AI clones of myself
26-06-2020T03:16:05,SageSaga,we would be our own animation studio
26-06-2020T03:16:13,SageSaga,i could release episodes daily

26-06-2020T03:23:23,SageSaga,hentai
26-06-2020T03:23:27,BadFoMo,Ah.
26-06-2020T03:23:57,SageSaga,it wouldnt be clones- they would be copies of my own abilities to draw and create
26-06-2020T03:24:14,SageSaga,i would just write scripts at super speed and my AI's would draw it all and color it
26-06-2020T03:24:42,BadFoMo,Oh... Nevermind then.
26-06-2020T03:25:20,AspiringNoodle,I'm headin' off to bed guys
26-06-2020T03:25:26,BadFoMo,Good night.
26-06-2020T03:25:27,AspiringNoodle,Stupid work tomorrow -3-
26-06-2020T03:26:18,AspiringNoodle,Cute Sandy so far sage~
26-06-2020T03:26:26,ZRO4825,"Have a good one, Noodle!"
26-06-2020T03:26:30,SageSaga,thanks - sleep well
26-06-2020T03:26:41,MatyMaty,wow is late
26-06-2020T03:26:45,MatyMaty,I better head to bed
26-06-2020T03:26:56,ZRO4825,"Have a g'night, Maty~"
26-06-2020T03:27:03,BadFoMo,Good night.
26-06-2020T03:27:04,SageSaga,sleep well Maty!
26-06-2020T03:27:29,MatyMaty,Nite nite!
26-06-2020T03:30:45,BadFoMo,I find it slightly funny that you're removing thoese parts of the ring; I was thinking about saying to do that as a joke.
26-06-2020T03:33:32,BadFoMo,"Wait a minute, we were just talking about psychic powers... You're in my brain! Get Out Of My Brain!"
26-06-2020T03:43:39,ZRO4825,lol
26-06-2020T03:46:46,SageSaga,there we go- token should be done?
26-06-2020T03:47:05,SageSaga,god it's so pretty- Tom does such good work
26-06-2020T03:47:56,ZRO4825,That he does.
26-06-2020T03:47:58,BadFoMo,Inb4 this character gets killed 5 minutes in and a new one is needed?
26-06-2020T03:48:10,ZRO4825,Shush Fomo! :joy:
26-06-2020T03:48:24,SageSaga,unlikely- shes a tough kitty- Abjuration Wizards are the tank Wizards
26-06-2020T03:49:04,BadFoMo,I know nothing about DnD so I'll take your word for it.
26-06-2020T03:50:07,SageSaga,abjuration is the magic of protection
26-06-2020T03:50:30,SageSaga,"its all about shielding, cancelling spells, dispelling magics, making attacks not exist"
26-06-2020T03:50:39,BadFoMo,Cool.
26-06-2020T03:51:02,SageSaga,as part of their spellcasting they weave the magic into a protective shield preventing them from coming to harm
26-06-2020T03:51:26,SageSaga,they even gain the ability to temporarily throw that shield to their allies to protect them
26-06-2020T03:51:49,SageSaga,they are the closest thing D&D has to a Tank Wizard
26-06-2020T04:02:41,SageSaga,gnight folks! take care! thanks for sticking around
26-06-2020T04:05:13,ZRO4825,"Have a g'night, Sage!"

26-06-2020T14:32:14,dynadrawss,Procreate sounds like an innuendo
26-06-2020T14:33:21,neropan,it is while you using you feel the urge of having children
26-06-2020T14:34:48,dynadrawss,LOL
26-06-2020T14:35:21,dynadrawss,"So whats this drawing gonna be, any idea lol"

26-06-2020T14:40:41,SageSaga,then when he realized he needed to be smarter to become the best fighter- he fought scientists... it didnt help though
26-06-2020T14:41:57,neropan,nobody is perfect
26-06-2020T14:42:38,SageSaga,"""why? I have defeated the greatest minds of our generation! Why can i not win?!"" ""You need to study and stuff to become Smarter!"" ""How do i do that?"" ""Read books?"""

26-06-2020T15:26:01,Tharkis,the last airbender? or blue space elves?
26-06-2020T15:26:08,neropan,last airbender
26-06-2020T15:26:12,neropan,actually both
26-06-2020T15:26:28,SageSaga,you should watch the cartoon sometime then
26-06-2020T15:26:30,Tharkis,i really liked avatar and kora
26-06-2020T15:26:34,Tharkis,i liked kora more
26-06-2020T15:26:47,Tharkis,skip the m.night shamalan attempt at a last air bender movie
26-06-2020T15:26:50,SageSaga,most people didnt like Kora more XD but i did enjoy Kora
26-06-2020T15:26:51,Tharkis,it's painfully bad
26-06-2020T15:27:29,neropan,it randomly showed on my yt feed
26-06-2020T15:27:34,neropan,so i was thinking bout giving it a try
26-06-2020T15:30:32,Nandred,define.... L O N G S T R E A M
26-06-2020T15:31:02,neropan,i'll be here fo a while
26-06-2020T15:31:02,Nandred,I really liked the adult ideas they had with Kora
26-06-2020T15:31:13,Nandred,I didnt like the execution of it
26-06-2020T15:31:28,neropan,but do you like my l o n g s t r e a m
26-06-2020T15:31:47,Nandred,does l o n g s t r e a m involve pickles?
26-06-2020T15:32:06,neropan,i believe my existence involves pickles
26-06-2020T15:40:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I scared some years out of a squirrel in my grandmas blueberries
26-06-2020T15:47:33,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
26-06-2020T15:48:27,SageSaga,yo Tom
26-06-2020T15:48:58,SageSaga,Mihari was looking at how much it cost to print that painting out on Canvas last night :P
26-06-2020T15:49:01,neropan,hoi hoi tom
26-06-2020T15:49:17,Twokinds,XD
26-06-2020T15:50:37,SageSaga,but with the lack of wallspace she then started looking at a thousand dollar ultrathin 43 inch tv to use to display pictures
26-06-2020T15:51:31,Twokinds,lol!
26-06-2020T15:51:35,Twokinds,That's one expensive poster
26-06-2020T15:52:41,SageSaga,i guess if you were gonna get like 100 posters to put up- a single 1000 dollar display works too-
26-06-2020T15:57:38,Tharkis,i have art i commissioned in order to print on canvas and hang on the wall
26-06-2020T15:57:42,Tharkis,and i've still never had it printed
26-06-2020T15:57:46,Tharkis,:ctharkis-uneasy:
26-06-2020T15:57:58,SpazztasticKiwi,hey Tom
26-06-2020T15:58:16,SageSaga,why spend money on getting art printed- when you can spend it to get more art made?
26-06-2020T15:58:32,Tharkis,"lol, that's basically exactly what i did >_<"
26-06-2020T15:59:04,Tharkis,i've got the art at nice like... 5k x 6k resolution
26-06-2020T15:59:15,Tharkis,so i that i could have it printed large size for my wall
26-06-2020T16:00:21,Tharkis,"little bummed, iriginally i'd have been taking off tomorrow for pittsburg to hang out with peopel"
26-06-2020T16:00:39,Tharkis,originally too
26-06-2020T16:01:08,SageSaga,next year
26-06-2020T16:01:24,SageSaga,after we all get our vaccines
26-06-2020T16:01:59,Tharkis,too bad my work has a 'use it or lose it 'policy
26-06-2020T16:02:13,Tharkis,i'd carry over all 4 weeks of my PTO and make an epic vacation next year
26-06-2020T16:04:28,SageSaga,random thought- who's bright idea was it to tie healthcare to a job?
26-06-2020T16:06:12,MatyMaty,using a TV as an art slideshow? :thinking:
26-06-2020T16:06:29,SageSaga,yep!
26-06-2020T16:06:32,SageSaga,hey Maty!
26-06-2020T16:06:43,neropan,allo maty
26-06-2020T16:06:46,MatyMaty,heya o/
26-06-2020T16:07:15,SageSaga,i used to use my TV for that but then i got a 4k tv and it didnt work well with my old chromeTV thingy
26-06-2020T16:07:43,SageSaga,and Roku got rid of their Dropbox app! so i cant use that
26-06-2020T16:09:17,MatyMaty,wouln't it be easier to get a cheapo comp and a goof computer monitor? :thinking:
26-06-2020T16:09:50,CrRAR,Proof of entropy
26-06-2020T16:10:19,CrRAR,Even the good things deviate toward disorder
26-06-2020T16:10:26,SageSaga,hmm- not really- the good thing about that tv we looked at was it was ultra thin and had a near zero profile and could be all wireless except the power cable- which could be hidden
26-06-2020T16:10:45,CrRAR,yis
26-06-2020T16:11:06,CrRAR,relocate power outlet or just run it through the wall
26-06-2020T16:11:33,SageSaga,oh- but you could get a decent sized monitor and install a rasberrypie inside the monitor!
26-06-2020T16:11:49,SageSaga,its a lot of extra work and you couldnt get it ultra thin
26-06-2020T16:12:35,SageSaga,but a rasberrypi with wifi could be a wireless solution and you can use a USB for power
26-06-2020T16:18:54,SageSaga,so you would need a monitor or tv with powered USB
26-06-2020T16:19:15,SageSaga,still- couldnt get the cool ultra thin though- ultra thins are expensive
26-06-2020T16:20:24,SageSaga,ya dont need a high refresh rate though on a screen thats just gonna display non-moving pictures XD
26-06-2020T16:21:29,MatyMaty,aren't TVs more expensive than computer screens of the same image quality?
26-06-2020T16:21:47,SageSaga,actually i dont think so
26-06-2020T16:22:06,SageSaga,a 4k tv is much cheaper than most 4k monitors
26-06-2020T16:22:19,SageSaga,a 1080p tv is super cheap
26-06-2020T16:23:11,MatyMaty,Personally I'd invest instead on art printer and just print as many images and copies of stuff as I want
26-06-2020T16:23:14,SageSaga,my 4k 55inch tv was like 600 dollars- and that things big- a 4k monitor of about the size and specs of my current one is like 650-700
26-06-2020T16:23:18,MatyMaty,but space is a problem
26-06-2020T16:23:24,SageSaga,ink is so expensive though T_T
26-06-2020T16:23:44,SageSaga,i had a great printer- but it cost 160USD to refill the ink!
26-06-2020T16:24:02,SageSaga,and i could only print 5 posters before it was out of ink!
26-06-2020T16:24:17,MatyMaty,"and I yeaah. I looked everywhere for a 4K screen to match my Mobile Studio, when I wanted to use it as a cintiq"
26-06-2020T16:24:31,MatyMaty,and I had to settle for a TV
26-06-2020T16:26:01,SageSaga,"Imagine- ""I would like one of these posters"" ""They are 32 dollars each"" ""What?!"" ""Yeah- and im selling them at a loss because that doesnt include the price of the paper- thats all ink"""
26-06-2020T16:29:23,SageSaga,so you hook up your studio to your laptop to draw on sometime?
26-06-2020T16:32:03,SageSaga,Nero- Loving this girl - also - how much does Procreate cost?
26-06-2020T16:32:12,MatyMaty,"used to, yeah"
26-06-2020T16:32:29,MatyMaty,with the thunderbolt cable
26-06-2020T16:32:39,MatyMaty,Nowadays I just use it as a standalone tho
26-06-2020T16:32:52,SageSaga,it's pretty powerful on its own for its size
26-06-2020T16:32:54,neropan,i think its 10 usd
26-06-2020T16:32:59,MatyMaty,procreate for iPad is like... $8?
26-06-2020T16:33:03,SageSaga,is it a subscription?
26-06-2020T16:33:06,MatyMaty,no
26-06-2020T16:33:34,SageSaga,good- i ordered an iPad- already got the pencil but- cant exactly use it till i get the pad
26-06-2020T16:33:46,SageSaga,had to talk to their customer service to extend the return policy on it
26-06-2020T16:34:17,SageSaga,ordered them both at the same time- pad will be here next month- got the pencil 2 days after ordering
26-06-2020T16:34:49,SageSaga,im not sure if im gonna keep it- gonna try it out- if i like it i will keep - otherwise i will send it back
26-06-2020T16:35:26,neropan,it's good although i'm only using it ebcause my equipment is in another sate
26-06-2020T16:35:33,neropan,state*
26-06-2020T16:35:44,neropan,i'm really not used to drawing on screen
26-06-2020T16:36:07,neropan,i mean i am on paper but screen is diferent somehow
26-06-2020T16:36:14,MatyMaty,Have in mind that Procreate is more like SAI than CSP
26-06-2020T16:36:24,MatyMaty,lots of great painting stuff
26-06-2020T16:36:28,SageSaga,yeah
26-06-2020T16:36:34,MatyMaty,very lacking in other kinds of tools
26-06-2020T16:36:42,SageSaga,i wanted to use both on the ipad
26-06-2020T16:36:52,MatyMaty,but hey its $10 :P
26-06-2020T16:37:04,SageSaga,unfortunately CSP is a subscription
26-06-2020T16:37:11,SageSaga,for the iPad version
26-06-2020T16:37:16,MatyMaty,"also, remember both CSP and Procreate have a layer limit"
26-06-2020T16:37:23,MatyMaty,based on the ram amount
26-06-2020T16:37:48,neropan,ah didn't know about that
26-06-2020T16:38:07,SageSaga,the new iPadPro has 6GBs of ram and apple is a lot more memory efficient
26-06-2020T16:39:00,MatyMaty,with 4 bg I could have like
26-06-2020T16:39:07,MatyMaty,8 layers at 6000 px
26-06-2020T16:39:13,MatyMaty,"er, 4gb"
26-06-2020T16:40:04,SageSaga,what im working on is 5000px and its print size for the comic- so i shouldnt need to go bigger than that
26-06-2020T16:40:30,MatyMaty,yeh a good idea is to try and see how many new layers it lets you create
26-06-2020T16:40:40,SageSaga,and you get a lot more out of your ram with a small upgrade
26-06-2020T16:40:42,MatyMaty,it will tell you when you reach the limit
26-06-2020T16:41:19,SageSaga,i'll test it out
26-06-2020T16:43:46,SageSaga,i remember you warned me about the memory issue before- its why i waited to hear the new one had more memory XD
26-06-2020T16:44:31,SageSaga,but i also saw Wacom increased its prices on the studios and no longer has any of their pro-cintiqs in stock
26-06-2020T16:45:21,SageSaga,so it was like- 2600 dollars or 1000 dollars?
26-06-2020T16:46:28,neropan,dang
26-06-2020T16:47:03,SageSaga,who thought i'd ever buy an apple product to save money-
26-06-2020T16:50:26,SageSaga,"maaan- i was just thinking ""after i finish this i can relax- sit back- and watch some anime"" and then i remembered- my anime shows both ended last week T_T"
26-06-2020T16:51:00,neropan,ooh i need to grab some more things to watch too
26-06-2020T16:51:15,neropan,i just really watched the villain one
26-06-2020T16:51:20,neropan,oh and baki 2020
26-06-2020T16:51:23,neropan,= v = b
26-06-2020T16:51:31,SageSaga,did ya watch Ascendance of a Bookworm?
26-06-2020T16:52:23,neropan,hmhm i don't think so
26-06-2020T16:52:33,SageSaga,watch it!
26-06-2020T16:54:02,neropan,wa genre is it o v o
26-06-2020T16:54:34,SageSaga,Isekai - Adorable Girl - Heart Warming
26-06-2020T16:56:08,MatyMaty,"the mobile studio pro is pretty worth it, imo"
26-06-2020T16:56:10,SageSaga,let me put it this way- I watched the first episode- i was intrigued- i found the manga- read all the manga- i wanted more- i bought all the light novels and read them all- now i get the books as they release and read them the same day
26-06-2020T16:56:38,SageSaga,Maty- you have the 16 right?
26-06-2020T16:56:49,MatyMaty,yup
26-06-2020T16:56:57,SageSaga,the 16 is 3400USD
26-06-2020T16:57:22,SageSaga,it's legit out of my price range T_T
26-06-2020T16:57:51,SageSaga,2600 for the 13 is too much for me atm - so the 16 is impossible for me
26-06-2020T16:58:10,MatyMaty,the 13 is still bigger screen wise than the iPad :o
26-06-2020T16:58:16,SageSaga,nope
26-06-2020T16:58:27,SageSaga,the iPadPro is a 13 inch
26-06-2020T16:58:32,Tharkis,did they fix the new mobile studio pros to not pop their screens of fwhen the batteries charge too much?
26-06-2020T16:58:32,SageSaga,12.9
26-06-2020T16:58:34,MatyMaty,12.9 :P
26-06-2020T16:58:45,MatyMaty,Yeah Tharkis
26-06-2020T16:59:02,MatyMaty,that's why they made a new version in 2019
26-06-2020T16:59:05,neropan,thats a cool feature !
26-06-2020T17:01:02,MatyMaty,although I kinda wish I wonder if I should have gotten the 32 cintiq instead
26-06-2020T17:01:18,MatyMaty,but you told me anything beyond 16 was kinda pointless
26-06-2020T17:01:54,SageSaga,i dont think i said that- but anything beyond 16 had other issues
26-06-2020T17:02:06,MatyMaty,you told me that! :P
26-06-2020T17:02:07,SageSaga,also cant be a mobile studio at that size-
26-06-2020T17:02:23,SageSaga,maybe you misunderstood me?
26-06-2020T17:02:28,MatyMaty,No it would be a regular cintiq
26-06-2020T17:02:44,SageSaga,it is pointless if you dont generally use that canvas- if you dont use your arm a lot
26-06-2020T17:02:52,SageSaga,if you use mostly your wrist and or short strokes
26-06-2020T17:03:01,MatyMaty,"You said like ""unless you are using to drawing on large surfaces don't get anything too big. 16 inch is good"""
26-06-2020T17:03:03,SageSaga,if you do really long strokes- yeah a bigger one works
26-06-2020T17:03:18,SageSaga,yeah
26-06-2020T17:03:41,SageSaga,if you arent used to doing big long arm strokes anything bigger than 16 is probably a waste of money
26-06-2020T17:05:13,SageSaga,im saying i wouldnt just blanket statement- anything more than 16 is too much- but rather if you arent one of those people used to painting on a huge canvas or in a huge drawing book like in art classes- you probably wont properly use a 22-32 inch screen
26-06-2020T17:05:57,SageSaga,so its a huge waste of money to spend 4000 dollars on just a screen tablet that you arent going to take advantage of
26-06-2020T17:06:09,MatyMaty,honestly before moving to digital only I always drew on letter size sketchebooks
26-06-2020T17:06:49,SageSaga,see? and 13 inch is letter sized- so 16 is great- it gives a bit more space if ya wanted to do more longer line work
26-06-2020T17:06:58,SageSaga,while being comfortable with what you are used to
26-06-2020T17:07:10,MatyMaty,yup yup
26-06-2020T17:07:31,MatyMaty,and for what I've seen in youtube and such
26-06-2020T17:07:51,MatyMaty,the people who use the really big cintiqs always seem to be doing 3D modeling/sculpting
26-06-2020T17:09:30,SageSaga,yeah i see that a lot too but im not sure if they do that because it looks good and looks like they are next level using cool tablets-
26-06-2020T17:10:07,SageSaga,but i can totally see wanting to zoom in for detail work and being able to then kinda lean back and see the whole thing still- or most of it to gauge how you're doing without zooming out
26-06-2020T17:10:10,SageSaga,which is a pain in 3D
26-06-2020T17:10:44,MatyMaty,Yeah
26-06-2020T17:12:32,SageSaga,but zooming in and out on a 2d picture with touch is like real-life+ XD
26-06-2020T17:12:47,MatyMaty,hahah XD
26-06-2020T17:12:54,SageSaga,i remember when i was drawing something at Anthrocon on paper last year- i pinched the paper to zoom in
26-06-2020T17:13:18,SageSaga,i looked around to make sure no one saw me do that- and then just put my face closer to the page
26-06-2020T17:14:52,MatyMaty,silly sage
26-06-2020T17:15:22,SageSaga,have you never been drawing on paper and tried to hit ctrl z? XD
26-06-2020T17:16:43,MatyMaty,I'm worse on the opposite way :P
26-06-2020T17:17:01,MatyMaty,I never use undo. I erase and redraw like I was still using paper
26-06-2020T17:17:19,SageSaga,that is inefficent!
26-06-2020T17:17:24,MatyMaty,I know!
26-06-2020T17:17:47,SageSaga,you even have an undo button on the tablet!
26-06-2020T17:18:21,MatyMaty,I don't use the tablet buttons either XP
26-06-2020T17:18:37,SageSaga,please start
26-06-2020T17:18:57,MatyMaty,I've tried but I just can't get used to it :P
26-06-2020T17:19:07,SageSaga,they were one of the main reasons i wanted a mobile studio even if i used it on my PC XD
26-06-2020T17:19:16,SageSaga,the Cintiq Pros dont have those buttons anymore
26-06-2020T17:19:43,MatyMaty,"yeah, Ron 's new tablet lacked the buttons"
26-06-2020T17:19:58,MatyMaty,much to his chagrin
26-06-2020T17:21:11,SageSaga,i was like- if i gotta use the new pro tablets im gonna have to use a switch pro controller
26-06-2020T17:21:39,MatyMaty,wacom sells a thing
26-06-2020T17:21:45,MatyMaty,to replace the buttons
26-06-2020T17:21:53,SageSaga,yeah but it sucks T_T
26-06-2020T17:21:59,SageSaga,Tom haaaaates it
26-06-2020T17:22:22,MatyMaty,or you can use a tartarus
26-06-2020T17:22:39,SageSaga,i can just use a bluetooth controler
26-06-2020T17:23:49,SageSaga,"lol i was like ""oh i can just use my old wii mote!"" and then i remembered my brother sold it"
26-06-2020T17:23:50,MatyMaty,"yeah, no cables :P"
26-06-2020T17:23:55,MatyMaty,boo
26-06-2020T17:24:03,MatyMaty,time to hit craiglist
26-06-2020T17:24:11,SageSaga,i have a pro controller for my switch
26-06-2020T17:24:13,SageSaga,i can use that
26-06-2020T17:24:27,SageSaga,or even take a joycon off the switch and use that XD
26-06-2020T17:24:48,SageSaga,oh derp
26-06-2020T17:24:58,SageSaga,or just use the freakn clip studio controller
26-06-2020T17:25:11,neropan,colorin takes my soul out :ptv-grossedout:
26-06-2020T17:25:15,SageSaga,i forgot i had that-
26-06-2020T17:25:29,SageSaga,why Nero? Coloring be fun and easy!
26-06-2020T17:25:37,neropan,no
26-06-2020T17:25:41,neropan,:ptv-grossedout:
26-06-2020T17:26:14,MatyMaty,why not try different color style? like cel shading?}
26-06-2020T17:26:49,SageSaga,i dont wanna recommend that because i love his watercolor esque painting style XD
26-06-2020T17:27:36,MatyMaty,"but is good to have a ""quick"" color style if you just watch to color fast drawings XD"
26-06-2020T17:28:20,SageSaga,i still have the Nyna picture he did as my phone background :P
26-06-2020T17:29:08,neropan,i get the hibbie jibbies with coloring
26-06-2020T17:29:55,neropan,makes me a tad anxious and with the feeling of just quitting and going to bed :ptv-excited:
26-06-2020T17:30:11,neropan,but its important so here we aare :ptv-grossedout:
26-06-2020T17:30:17,neropan,i love seeing other people color tho
26-06-2020T17:30:51,SageSaga,im currently in excruciating pain! I think im gonna need to get surgery but i dont wanna be out 2 weeks
26-06-2020T17:31:12,MatyMaty,:(
26-06-2020T17:31:13,Twokinds,Awww
26-06-2020T17:31:17,FoxxTrotter,:0(
26-06-2020T17:31:28,Twokinds,"I hate that you're in pain, Sage."
26-06-2020T17:31:34,Twokinds,"If it's that bad, you should take it easy."
26-06-2020T17:31:44,neropan,in pain and coloring ?? jesas
26-06-2020T17:31:46,SageSaga,its going to hurt no matter what i do
26-06-2020T17:32:06,neropan,but yep take it easy sagy
26-06-2020T17:32:18,BadFoMo,Get well soon?
26-06-2020T17:32:19,SageSaga,taking it easy wont do anything though- XD
26-06-2020T17:32:51,MatyMaty,Forcing yourself won't do it either
26-06-2020T17:33:21,SageSaga,the pain last anywhere from 4-16 hours and nothing can stop it- working- not working- doesnt matter
26-06-2020T17:34:19,Twokinds,"If you need surgery, I'm sure people will understand you taking 2 weeks. You haven't taken a long break from comics in what... ever?"
26-06-2020T17:35:05,SageSaga,maybe i can schedule something after i get the tablet
26-06-2020T17:36:23,SageSaga,im gonna try the medicine- it will burn and give me a terrible headache and might not work- but - it might reduce the pain a bit-
26-06-2020T17:36:34,SageSaga,brb with headache
26-06-2020T17:38:05,CrRAR,:c
26-06-2020T17:39:13,BadFoMo,Dang.
26-06-2020T17:39:15,neropan,it feels like 10 hours past
26-06-2020T17:39:26,neropan,but only like 3 and a half
26-06-2020T17:39:27,neropan,help
26-06-2020T17:40:29,Tharkis,lol
26-06-2020T17:40:53,Twokinds,I'm going to be updating soon
26-06-2020T17:40:58,SageSaga,oh my god- my brain is swelling in my skuuuullllll!!!!
26-06-2020T17:41:20,SageSaga,the medicine really likes you to know its in the blood stream
26-06-2020T17:41:58,SageSaga,holy crap-
26-06-2020T17:43:33,SageSaga,i can count my pulse by counting the pulses of pain in my braaaaain
26-06-2020T17:44:15,unsteddyphoenix,In other words; your brain trembles?
26-06-2020T17:44:26,SageSaga,IT  TREEEEEEEEMBLLEEESSS!!!!!
26-06-2020T17:46:03,neropan,its an unsteddy
26-06-2020T17:46:06,neropan,ello
26-06-2020T17:46:08,unsteddyphoenix,generally a good sign
26-06-2020T17:46:11,unsteddyphoenix,Hiiiiee~
26-06-2020T17:46:26,SageSaga,it's calming down now- but moving my head hurts
26-06-2020T17:46:33,BadFoMo,"Why am I reminded of the line; ""My brain is on fire!""?"
26-06-2020T17:47:08,SageSaga,i kid you not - if you put this stuff on your skin you will get a headache in under 2 minutes
26-06-2020T17:47:26,BadFoMo,...That's the only thing I know about Refer Madness.
26-06-2020T17:47:39,BadFoMo,Dang!
26-06-2020T17:47:54,CrRAR,It's like it hates brains or something
26-06-2020T17:48:25,SageSaga,well it very quickly absorbs into your skin and into the blood stream- and it widens your blood vessels
26-06-2020T17:48:39,neropan,i mean if you see only this part it looks half finished right right
26-06-2020T17:48:40,SageSaga,unfortunately it also goes into the brain and widens those
26-06-2020T17:48:47,CrRAR,lovely
26-06-2020T17:48:58,CrRAR,like a vascular brain hug
26-06-2020T17:49:02,neropan,so when half of the work is done it okay to take break right  = v =
26-06-2020T17:49:12,SageSaga,nerooo
26-06-2020T17:49:20,SageSaga,its ok to take a break whenever ya need it
26-06-2020T17:49:29,unsteddyphoenix,Ok i'll play devil
26-06-2020T17:49:31,unsteddyphoenix,NO BREAKS

26-06-2020T17:50:42,neropan,taking breaks is what makes a good work even better when its finished  \ = v = \
26-06-2020T17:50:45,SageSaga,i just took a break to let the headache pass
26-06-2020T17:50:58,SageSaga,because while i can work while in pain- i cant with a headache T_T
26-06-2020T17:51:11,neropan,that's fair
26-06-2020T17:51:28,neropan,the thing i'm hating the most about drawing in a screen my back screaming
26-06-2020T17:51:36,neropan,because i'm used to have tablet and monitor
26-06-2020T17:51:45,neropan,my necc actually

26-06-2020T17:54:34,FoxxTrotter,"C-yas, Nero."
26-06-2020T17:55:29,RedDragonSyndicate,yo
26-06-2020T17:56:44,SageSaga,hey Red how are ya?
26-06-2020T17:57:07,FoxxTrotter,"Hiya, Red. :cfoxxtrotter-FoxxTrotterIcon:"
26-06-2020T17:58:56,NibblyBot,New Comic Page: The Painting Pt 2 http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/1113/
26-06-2020T17:59:56,RedDragonSyndicate,I'm hanging in
26-06-2020T17:59:57,RedDragonSyndicate,you?
26-06-2020T18:00:31,Dadrobit,o dang
26-06-2020T18:01:37,SageSaga,i am in moderate pain which is better than i was
26-06-2020T18:06:35,RedDragonSyndicate,pain is no good man
26-06-2020T18:07:01,CrRAR,:ccrrar-beakr:
26-06-2020T18:07:20,Mediawatcher,"That new page, so rose died oh no!"
26-06-2020T18:07:44,SageSaga,well- yeah- shes old
26-06-2020T18:11:03,Azumachan,Nice one Tom
26-06-2020T18:12:08,Mediawatcher,Dang it tom! So many bombshells in just a few pages!
26-06-2020T18:14:05,Twokinds,Yeah :D
26-06-2020T18:14:22,Mediawatcher,Makes me wonder what else will be revealed soon!
26-06-2020T18:14:32,Twokinds,"Maaan, I had this page written since we first arrived at the estate, and I've been waiting so long to get to it. XD"
26-06-2020T18:14:41,Dadrobit,Nice!
26-06-2020T18:14:44,CrRAR,haha
26-06-2020T18:15:15,SageSaga,now ya gotta figure out- is Euchre also a ghost Keidran?
26-06-2020T18:15:20,Mediawatcher,Well now it‚Äôs finally here!
26-06-2020T18:15:39,Mediawatcher,You really planned ahead!
26-06-2020T18:15:52,Twokinds,"He is even older, it's true."
26-06-2020T18:16:13,MatyMaty,Now I wonder if this Rose is a ghost/undead/memory of the real one. Or the real Rose died and this is something/someone else
26-06-2020T18:16:13,Azumachan,Magic ghosts ~~
26-06-2020T18:16:18,MatyMaty,:thinking:
26-06-2020T18:16:43,Mediawatcher,"So rose and euchre are already dead, these are just ghosts!"
26-06-2020T18:16:46,SageSaga,i know a lot of people were assuming he could live longer because he can transform- but so could Rose- but maybe Euchre had some other magic- or maybe Rose just didnt live enough time as a human for the extended life span
26-06-2020T18:17:01,CrRAR,Pesky keidran mortality
26-06-2020T18:17:12,CrimsonHelsing,My God .
26-06-2020T18:17:20,SageSaga,but Rose ghost was always one of my theories
26-06-2020T18:17:39,SageSaga,along with the Burnt Offerings theory
26-06-2020T18:17:48,MatyMaty,"what would be the craziest theory? Saria's spirit in Rose's dead body, and that's why she wants to swap to Maren?"
26-06-2020T18:17:51,CrRAR,First Saria as a ghost
26-06-2020T18:17:54,Mediawatcher,"Ow that I think about it, it makes sense, there is no way they would‚Äôve been able to live this long"
26-06-2020T18:17:55,CrRAR,Now Rose
26-06-2020T18:18:01,CrRAR,"Ghosts, ghosts everywhere"
26-06-2020T18:18:02,Mediawatcher,So rose wants to use maren to bring back saria
26-06-2020T18:18:11,Mediawatcher,Holy!
26-06-2020T18:18:13,johnnytho,Yoo that page man
26-06-2020T18:18:32,CrimsonHelsing,"My God... Jesus Christ no.... oh Christ, Tom, no..."
26-06-2020T18:18:52,Mediawatcher,I figured she was a part of this
26-06-2020T18:18:58,SageSaga,Burnt Offerings was a horror movie about a haunted house that would take a person and use them to keep the place safe- it would extend their life but made them a husk of a person eventually
26-06-2020T18:19:05,IronHorseComics,Tooooooom! You have some 'splining to dooo!
26-06-2020T18:19:07,CrimsonHelsing,Please no...
26-06-2020T18:19:18,CrimsonHelsing,I'm utterly terrified now
26-06-2020T18:19:19,IronHorseComics,*'splaining
26-06-2020T18:19:22,CrRAR,Maybe just possess the baby too while they're at it.
26-06-2020T18:19:32,CrimsonHelsing,No!!!
26-06-2020T18:19:34,MatyMaty,"it was clear she was part of this. People who were like ""Rose would never do that!"" were just in denial :P"
26-06-2020T18:19:42,MatyMaty,Like when Laura died. Denial everywhere
26-06-2020T18:20:13,SageSaga,some things i cant discuss because I do know things that havent been said yet in the comics
26-06-2020T18:20:27,BadFoMo,Like?
26-06-2020T18:20:30,SageSaga,but i remember Tom complaining about having to draw dust XD
26-06-2020T18:20:36,CrRAR,lol
26-06-2020T18:20:37,MatyMaty,he just said he can't say :P
26-06-2020T18:20:44,Twokinds,Yes dusty dust
26-06-2020T18:20:50,Dadrobit,An old theory I had when it became obvious Rose wasn't normal was that Trace continued his experiments on Rose for practice on bringing back Saria.
26-06-2020T18:21:12,MatyMaty,what's the current year in TW?
26-06-2020T18:21:12,Mediawatcher,I‚Äôm just shaking thinking about what you and Tom are hiding from us!
26-06-2020T18:21:13,CrRAR,"""I made a beautiful surface... now to UNbeautify it!"""
26-06-2020T18:21:14,BadFoMo,@MatyMaty I'm trying to trick him into giving spoilers!
26-06-2020T18:21:15,johnnytho,Perks of being Tom's friend i guess
26-06-2020T18:21:23,Mediawatcher,Lucky sage
26-06-2020T18:21:28,johnnytho,lucky man
26-06-2020T18:21:34,CrimsonHelsing,I'm terrified! ;A;
26-06-2020T18:21:35,johnnytho,early access
26-06-2020T18:21:35,SageSaga,i wrote a whole story for Tom to use for a side comic in the mansion- but we're not using that
26-06-2020T18:21:51,SageSaga,too spooky or something- or made Mike look too cool
26-06-2020T18:21:57,Mediawatcher,Well can‚Äôt wait to see what Tom has in store for us after that bombshell
26-06-2020T18:21:59,MatyMaty,"The one of you and Karen becoming a couple doesn't count, Sage"
26-06-2020T18:22:05,Twokinds,It's Autumn 482
26-06-2020T18:22:05,johnnytho,lmao
26-06-2020T18:22:07,SageSaga,thats a different thing
26-06-2020T18:22:21,CrimsonHelsing,"Please Rose... please don't hurt them, please..."
26-06-2020T18:22:22,MatyMaty,so Rose has been dead for 2 years now
26-06-2020T18:22:31,Mediawatcher,"Rose, what have you done?"
26-06-2020T18:22:48,CrRAR,she... held a funeral for herself?
26-06-2020T18:22:53,MatyMaty,Now I see why Dark Trace freaked out about freeing her
26-06-2020T18:23:04,BadFoMo,@SageSaga Any chance that first side story will see the light of day?
26-06-2020T18:23:08,Mediawatcher,No wonder! Now she has full control!
26-06-2020T18:23:11,IronHorseComics,does... this mean she died before Saria?
26-06-2020T18:23:16,CrimsonHelsing,No
26-06-2020T18:23:23,johnnytho,Ok so ima have to reread the last chapter
26-06-2020T18:23:24,Mediawatcher,No after saria
26-06-2020T18:23:24,IronHorseComics,or did Trace hire someone to paint her?
26-06-2020T18:23:30,SageSaga,which one?
26-06-2020T18:23:33,IronHorseComics,*her portrait
26-06-2020T18:23:41,IronHorseComics,Rose's portrait
26-06-2020T18:24:39,BadFoMo,The one that was too spooky and/or made Mike look cool.
26-06-2020T18:24:41,Mediawatcher,"I knew it, I knew rose was a part of this!"
26-06-2020T18:24:49,MatyMaty,"CrimsonHelsing, you don't even know if that's really Rose"
26-06-2020T18:24:56,IronHorseComics,"because, why would evil Trace hire someone to paint a portrait of Rose if she died AFTER Saria"
26-06-2020T18:24:59,SageSaga,oh no- thats not gonna be released-
26-06-2020T18:25:04,Mediawatcher,Probably a projection
26-06-2020T18:25:08,BadFoMo,****.
26-06-2020T18:25:10,MatyMaty,Could be some kind of homunculi copied from the real one
26-06-2020T18:25:17,IronHorseComics,or a skrull
26-06-2020T18:26:52,unsteddyphoenix,Whats weird is she had a very in-character seeming conversation with Euchre.
26-06-2020T18:27:13,Dadrobit,The painting may have been made prior and the frame itself was made after.
26-06-2020T18:27:14,unsteddyphoenix,And her accent accidentally snuck out sometimes
26-06-2020T18:27:27,unsteddyphoenix,So im inclined to believe its still Rose
26-06-2020T18:27:31,CrRAR,I wonder if it's finally demise-arranging time.
26-06-2020T18:28:00,unsteddyphoenix,I knew she'd be evil though~ now I get to hit some 'told you so;s
26-06-2020T18:28:09,CrRAR,haha
26-06-2020T18:28:26,Mediawatcher,So how old is euchre?
26-06-2020T18:28:34,Dadrobit,"Like I said, I think Trace succeeded in his experiments on Rose and discovered he needed a conduit which lead him to needing Maren. Rose's soul is probably in some conduit locked in the Rose room."
26-06-2020T18:28:38,unsteddyphoenix,30~ I think?
26-06-2020T18:28:41,Mediawatcher,I guess this means he‚Äôs dead to
26-06-2020T18:28:43,Mediawatcher,Too
26-06-2020T18:28:45,BadFoMo,"@SageSaga ...Not even as a writin summory; or be resicled for something else? Sorry to keep asking about it, but I just gotta know."
26-06-2020T18:28:49,CrRAR,No one gets bound to an estate forever without developing a little bit of animosity
26-06-2020T18:28:49,unsteddyphoenix,Nah I dont think so.
26-06-2020T18:29:19,unsteddyphoenix,Euchres lifespan is explainable with perfect transformation. Rose was always the confusing one.
26-06-2020T18:29:20,Mediawatcher,Shouldn‚Äôt this mean euchre is gone too?
26-06-2020T18:29:26,SageSaga,no it wont get released
26-06-2020T18:29:28,Mediawatcher,Oh ok got it
26-06-2020T18:29:49,BadFoMo,Dang...
26-06-2020T18:29:53,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, you still might be right ofc, but I think he's alive personally"
26-06-2020T18:30:09,SageSaga,its possible some bits and things could be used later which could cause spoilers- probably not but its not impossible
26-06-2020T18:30:12,unsteddyphoenix,"Rose can't step foot outside the mansion, I think we might know why now"
26-06-2020T18:30:17,Mediawatcher,So euchre is also a projection like rose
26-06-2020T18:30:36,Sirdan87,Evening folks
26-06-2020T18:30:40,BadFoMo,Yo.
26-06-2020T18:30:40,CrRAR,hello
26-06-2020T18:30:53,MatyMaty,I guess we can assume Rose is behind the statues attack
26-06-2020T18:31:18,Sirdan87,How are folks doing today?
26-06-2020T18:31:23,unsteddyphoenix,Perhaps? I think they were part of her plan at least
26-06-2020T18:31:32,unsteddyphoenix,Like she knew at some point Maren would trigger the trap
26-06-2020T18:32:00,Mediawatcher,Then who was rose talking to when maren got captured?
26-06-2020T18:32:31,BadFoMo,I'm fine; you?
26-06-2020T18:33:19,Sirdan87,Doing alright here. Just got back from a small family gathering. Brother wanted to cook out cause he wouldn't be around 4th of July.
26-06-2020T18:34:21,CrRAR,one big happy
26-06-2020T18:34:22,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-rose:*[family]
26-06-2020T18:34:47,Sirdan87,Also gives him a reason to use his Smoker Grill.
26-06-2020T18:35:00,CrRAR,nice
26-06-2020T18:35:10,CrRAR,any ribs?
26-06-2020T18:35:27,Sirdan87,Pulled Pork and he had 2 different type of beans.
26-06-2020T18:35:38,IronHorseComics,"let's not forget that Clovis and his goons are still right outside the estate, who knows what they might be trying to pull?"
26-06-2020T18:35:47,CrRAR,"pulled pork, a summer delicacy"
26-06-2020T18:36:07,CrRAR,yaeh iron
26-06-2020T18:36:45,Mediawatcher,"So a haunted mansion and Clovis at the same time, this isn‚Äôt good"
26-06-2020T18:38:22,Sirdan87,"Aside from that, resting now and feeling sore from using my Ring Fit."
26-06-2020T18:40:32,MatyMaty,"Mediawatcher, I suspect Clovis henchmen are gonna break in and then be like ""this was a bad idea"""
26-06-2020T18:41:03,BadFoMo,@MatyMaty I have the same feeling.
26-06-2020T18:41:22,Mediawatcher,@matymaty that would be pretty funny
26-06-2020T18:41:32,Mediawatcher,And yeah it won‚Äôt end well for them
26-06-2020T18:41:55,Mediawatcher,"Deal with haunted mansion now, clovis later"
26-06-2020T18:43:10,MatyMaty,"who would win. Some wolf terrorists? of an army of super strong, immortal stone lizardmen"
26-06-2020T18:43:28,IronHorseComics,"but then there's Brahn's bastards, the ones who kidnapped Adira"
26-06-2020T18:44:24,BadFoMo,It's not the stone lizards I'm worried about.
26-06-2020T18:44:27,IronHorseComics,who may in fact just be more of Clovis' goons
26-06-2020T18:45:58,Mediawatcher,"The haunted mansion, clovis, adira and Maeve, Things are getting even more intense!"
26-06-2020T18:45:59,BadFoMo,"Kidnapped? They arested her for questioning. Also, what would Clovis want with her?"
26-06-2020T18:46:26,IronHorseComics,"oh I don't know, the portal that's in her tavern"
26-06-2020T18:46:32,Mediawatcher,Makes we wonder will happen after this chapter
26-06-2020T18:46:39,BadFoMo,Good point.
26-06-2020T18:46:48,unsteddyphoenix,army of trained wolf terrorists or some stony boys
26-06-2020T18:47:01,Mediawatcher,The trained wolves would most likely win
26-06-2020T18:47:07,Mediawatcher,Though the stones are really tough
26-06-2020T18:48:13,Dadrobit,"Canonically, Brutus is already sturdier than stone."
26-06-2020T18:48:35,Dadrobit,My dude survived a dragon tail smash that crumbled the city wall he was standing on
26-06-2020T18:48:54,Dadrobit,"Wait, I think it has her forepaw, not her tail"
26-06-2020T18:48:58,MatyMaty,"Mediawatcher, the statues are already giving troubles to a *dragon*"
26-06-2020T18:48:59,Dadrobit,Regardless
26-06-2020T18:49:11,MatyMaty,I wouldn't bet on the wolves
26-06-2020T18:50:09,CrRAR,"stoneybois, then"
26-06-2020T18:50:12,IronHorseComics,Brutus is the exception
26-06-2020T18:50:21,Dadrobit,Yeah he is~~~
26-06-2020T18:50:22,IronHorseComics,"he's Kronk, he'll survive a couple of hits"
26-06-2020T18:50:44,CrRAR,yeah he don't have to worry much about head trauma
26-06-2020T18:50:50,unsteddyphoenix,Perhaps clovis gave him some magical items since he's his favourite
26-06-2020T18:50:55,unsteddyphoenix,Lol Cr
26-06-2020T18:50:55,CrRAR,lol
26-06-2020T18:51:28,CrRAR,He bestowed him with a magic milkbone
26-06-2020T18:51:40,CrRAR,it works a little like the ruby slipper in the Wizard of Oz
26-06-2020T18:51:43,Dadrobit,Brutus and Reni could compare each others gifted magic items.
26-06-2020T18:51:55,Mediawatcher,"So the wolves are gonna get thrashed by the stones, wonder how brutus is doing right now"
26-06-2020T18:52:05,Mediawatcher,Also zen and kat
26-06-2020T18:52:17,unsteddyphoenix,Someone save Kat pls
26-06-2020T18:52:18,unsteddyphoenix,pls
26-06-2020T18:52:31,CrRAR,I honestly hoped Sythe would find the other wolves
26-06-2020T18:52:35,CrRAR,and team up or somethig
26-06-2020T18:52:48,Mediawatcher,We don‚Äôt know what happened to him either
26-06-2020T18:53:08,Mediawatcher,"Zen, kat, and sythe so far haven‚Äôt showed up"
26-06-2020T18:53:13,CrRAR,Boked head on table is the surprise and now is fat asleep on the floor
26-06-2020T18:53:20,CrRAR,*in
26-06-2020T18:53:23,Mediawatcher,Makes me scared thinks what‚Äôs happened to them
26-06-2020T18:53:24,CrRAR,*fast
26-06-2020T18:54:13,Mediawatcher,@CrRAR maybe when we see sythe again it‚Äôs him waking up after that
26-06-2020T18:54:25,Mediawatcher,Waking up to Nibbly on his face
26-06-2020T18:55:05,CrRAR,"Nibs went off to save Sythe, sounds reasonable"
26-06-2020T18:55:33,Mediawatcher,She would do anything to save him
26-06-2020T18:56:31,Mediawatcher,He‚Äôll definitely be worried for maren thougg
26-06-2020T18:56:33,Mediawatcher,Though
26-06-2020T18:56:36,Mediawatcher,Can‚Äôt spell for shit
26-06-2020T18:56:52,Dadrobit,Everybody forgets about Lynn
26-06-2020T18:57:00,Mediawatcher,Oh yeah wonder where he is
26-06-2020T18:57:03,Mediawatcher,And madelyn
26-06-2020T18:57:21,unsteddyphoenix,Lynn and Maddie can take care of themselves
26-06-2020T18:57:30,Mediawatcher,Maddie almost died to a stone lizard
26-06-2020T18:57:48,IronHorseComics,"to be fair, Stoney was made by Nora"
26-06-2020T18:57:48,Mediawatcher,I‚Äôm sure she can but her chances aren‚Äôt good against those stones
26-06-2020T18:57:49,Dadrobit,Stoney is a particular stoney boi tho
26-06-2020T18:57:52,unsteddyphoenix,This time she'll backflip away
26-06-2020T18:57:58,SageSaga,done!
26-06-2020T18:58:04,IronHorseComics,the rest of them made by Trace and clearly not as good
26-06-2020T18:58:08,Dadrobit,"Right on, Sage"
26-06-2020T18:58:15,Mediawatcher,Nice job sage
26-06-2020T18:58:41,BadFoMo,Cool!
26-06-2020T18:59:17,Mediawatcher,"Wonder how Stoney will fair against the stone dragons, I figure he‚Äôd be pretty effective"
26-06-2020T18:59:26,unsteddyphoenix,naisu
26-06-2020T18:59:31,MatyMaty,Graet work Sage!
26-06-2020T18:59:42,Mediawatcher,Consider he‚Äôs a Nora stone
26-06-2020T18:59:52,IronHorseComics,Stoney would be the friggin' Hulk compared to them
26-06-2020T19:00:05,SageSaga,take care! D&D is gonna be a bit late because Silver is running late
26-06-2020T19:00:09,Mediawatcher,I want to see him thrash the stone dragons!
26-06-2020T19:00:14,Sirdan87,Have fun with D&D
26-06-2020T19:00:35,Dadrobit,Have fun! Sorry I couldn't be more useful lol.
26-06-2020T19:08:25,ShamusTheFox,Whaaaaaaaat
26-06-2020T19:08:36,ShamusTheFox,Rose has been dead for 2 years
26-06-2020T19:28:05,Dadrobit,"Coolio, my birthday present came like a month early."
26-06-2020T19:28:22,Dadrobit,"Ordered a model kit that was supposed to arrive in like mid July, turned up a week later."
26-06-2020T19:28:33,Dadrobit,I am a happier camper.
26-06-2020T19:28:47,CrRAR,nice
26-06-2020T19:30:06,Dadrobit,Was playing Death Stranding last weekend and totally impulse bought the Ludens Figure Model Kit.
26-06-2020T19:31:00,CrRAR,didn't know they had that
26-06-2020T19:31:04,CrRAR,wow
26-06-2020T19:31:32,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I saw it as a collectible in-game and was like, ""No way, that isn't real is it?"""
26-06-2020T19:31:43,Dadrobit,Totally is. Bought it immediately.
26-06-2020T19:32:35,Dadrobit,I'll probably end up putting it together some time this weekend.
26-06-2020T20:36:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I finally told guy I wasn‚Äôt reminding him to have gloves on at all times
26-06-2020T20:37:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm letting the cameras catch him
26-06-2020T20:41:08,SpazztasticKiwi,also picarto be buggy
26-06-2020T20:52:49,CrRAR,way to be spazz
26-06-2020T20:52:54,CrRAR,upholding the LAW
26-06-2020T20:53:06,CrRAR,:cop:

26-06-2020T22:31:01,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
26-06-2020T22:35:56,Ordithus,it's gettin' freaky
26-06-2020T22:39:54,Ordithus,":ctwokinds-rose: prettiest zombie ever, ngl"
26-06-2020T22:41:14,CrRAR,ikr
26-06-2020T23:12:03,AspiringNoodle,"I'm missing something, lol"
26-06-2020T23:12:16,CrRAR,What you missing?
26-06-2020T23:12:31,AspiringNoodle,pretties zombie ever
26-06-2020T23:13:37,CrRAR,Cuz Rose somehow alive past death.
26-06-2020T23:14:11,AspiringNoodle,Oka
26-06-2020T23:14:48,CrRAR,"ofc, there‚Äôs probably some other trickery afoot"
26-06-2020T23:20:16,CrRAR,"What I‚Äôm curious about is where the portrait was moved from and when, if it was moved recently."
26-06-2020T23:21:00,CrRAR,It couldn‚Äôt have been before the Maddie/Karen incident by Rose if she didn‚Äôt have knowledge of the area.
26-06-2020T23:21:44,CrRAR,Maybe after from within the mysterious room?
26-06-2020T23:22:24,CrRAR,but why move it one room over I wonder then
26-06-2020T23:22:55,CrRAR,"Unless it belonged in the lobby, but that seems a weird place for that portrait"
26-06-2020T23:24:46,Ordithus,her other portrait was there
26-06-2020T23:24:55,CrRAR,Yeah the younger her
26-06-2020T23:25:10,CrRAR,Which Eric commented seemed odd
26-06-2020T23:25:35,CrRAR,Maybe Rose already ‚Äútook care‚Äù of him for being suspicious xD
26-06-2020T23:25:55,CrRAR,‚ÄúSuspect I‚Äôm DEAD WILL YEE!‚Äù
26-06-2020T23:25:57,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, new page is up"
26-06-2020T23:26:00,AspiringNoodle,"That's why, lol"
26-06-2020T23:26:01,CrRAR,Yesssss
26-06-2020T23:26:04,CrRAR,xD
26-06-2020T23:26:14,CrRAR,You spook‚Äôd yet?
26-06-2020T23:26:18,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rose:*[What a twist!]
26-06-2020T23:26:59,Ordithus,"it is 482, by the way"
26-06-2020T23:27:01,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-shock:
26-06-2020T23:27:23,CrRAR,I like the sketch version has the freakier glasses.
26-06-2020T23:27:35,CrRAR,...but I love the subtle red glow on the final
26-06-2020T23:27:40,Ordithus,Alternatively
26-06-2020T23:27:41,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rose:*[The news of my death was premature]
26-06-2020T23:28:07,AspiringNoodle,Maybe the mad lad actually did it
26-06-2020T23:28:15,AspiringNoodle,He figured out how to extend a Keidran's life
26-06-2020T23:28:18,CrRAR,"‚ÄúI may be old but I‚Äôm not dea- oh wait, yes I am.‚Äù"
26-06-2020T23:28:27,AspiringNoodle,"But was like, ""Whoops, can't get this little doozy get out..."""
26-06-2020T23:28:29,Ordithus,"""bleh"""
26-06-2020T23:28:40,CrRAR,"‚ÄúWell, things are gettin freaky, either way‚Äù"
26-06-2020T23:29:12,CrRAR,I wonder how long Reni knew Rose
26-06-2020T23:29:35,CrRAR,Someone should deliver the news to the poor girl
26-06-2020T23:29:47,CrRAR,‚ÄúYour friend is dead‚Äù
26-06-2020T23:29:49,Ordithus,Raine is in for a shock
26-06-2020T23:29:56,CrRAR,ikr‚Äù
26-06-2020T23:30:00,Ordithus,Euchre... he probably knows
26-06-2020T23:30:14,SpazztasticKiwi,dadro have you heard ‚Äúvote him away‚Äù
26-06-2020T23:30:42,CrRAR,"Yeah, he may have wanted to keep the truth from her and just keep the whole mess under wraps."
26-06-2020T23:31:13,CrRAR,Under the guise of prtecting Trace/Flora maybe.
26-06-2020T23:31:29,CrRAR,"Which it would, because this doesn‚Äôt seem good for anyone"
26-06-2020T23:31:39,CrRAR,at th estate
26-06-2020T23:32:00,Ordithus,thought maybe he doesn't.  Maybe Rose doesn't know
26-06-2020T23:32:32,Ordithus,"Maybe... no one, not even Tom :ctwokinds-floAAA:"
26-06-2020T23:32:41,CrRAR,We know she was blocked from those areas and the secret hallway couldn‚Äôt be found easily.
26-06-2020T23:33:02,CrRAR,Rose did know though ‚ÄúSomeone is where they shouldn‚Äôt be‚Äù
26-06-2020T23:33:39,CrRAR,...but did she just get a general alarm in her head or whatever we don‚Äôt know
26-06-2020T23:34:11,CrRAR,"She must know her powers over the estate are somewhat pretty unnatural, before or after being unlimited"
26-06-2020T23:34:21,Ordithus,"her interactions with Euchre, Trace, and Raine all seemed very genuine, like it really is her"
26-06-2020T23:34:25,CrRAR,Yes
26-06-2020T23:34:31,CrRAR,100%
26-06-2020T23:35:49,CrRAR,"I feel like her interactions with Trace have been overly cordial, despite whatever this is that keeps her around."
26-06-2020T23:36:10,CrRAR,That was really the biggest change it seemed after.
26-06-2020T23:36:23,Ordithus,she did have a hearty good laugh
26-06-2020T23:38:09,CrRAR,I feel like Trace may have exploited her care for Saria as motivation to keep her around and may have numbed her awareness of the truth of the rest of it magically or something.
26-06-2020T23:39:11,CrRAR,Like Rose said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here because of her‚Äù
26-06-2020T23:40:07,CrRAR,Till she finds out that she really died two years ago and is STILL HERE because of HIM. xD
26-06-2020T23:40:11,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-sadtrace2:
26-06-2020T23:40:37,CrRAR,*[crap]
26-06-2020T23:41:30,Ordithus,I'm sure it will all work out to a happy ending for everyone
26-06-2020T23:43:06,CrRAR,hehehe
26-06-2020T23:44:06,AspiringNoodle,Inb4 Rose is just a ghost whose spirit is bound to the mansion by the power granted to her by Trace
26-06-2020T23:44:49,AspiringNoodle,And she doesn't know she's ded
26-06-2020T23:45:28,Ordithus,":ctwokinds-rose:*[Ain't got time for bein' dead, got chores]"
26-06-2020T23:45:57,AspiringNoodle,"Iirc, didn't Saria's ghost appear WAAAAAAAAAAY early in the comic?"
26-06-2020T23:46:06,CrRAR,Yeah
26-06-2020T23:46:06,AspiringNoodle,But to everyone that viewed her it looked like she was alive?
26-06-2020T23:46:29,CrRAR,"Yeah, she went back to her grave to poof"
26-06-2020T23:49:41,Ordithus,she appeared during the whole Neutral arc
26-06-2020T23:50:14,RimaDraws,hey
26-06-2020T23:50:15,AspiringNoodle,"So, it's actually quite possible that Rose is actually a ghost at this point"
26-06-2020T23:50:20,Ordithus,hi Rima!
26-06-2020T23:50:21,AspiringNoodle,"Hoi hoi, Rima~"
26-06-2020T23:50:24,RimaDraws,hi
26-06-2020T23:50:57,AspiringNoodle,Jus discussing the implications of the latest page
26-06-2020T23:51:12,AspiringNoodle,And trying to figure out what the flippin' heck Rose is
26-06-2020T23:51:21,RimaDraws,yea not happy with it...
26-06-2020T23:51:39,AspiringNoodle,"My vote's in the ""she's a spooper"" angle"
26-06-2020T23:53:06,RimaDraws,well i am not happy she is dead
26-06-2020T23:53:17,RimaDraws,ruined a great character
26-06-2020T23:53:45,CrRAR,"Well, she lives on some freaky way this way"
26-06-2020T23:53:54,RimaDraws,not to me
26-06-2020T23:54:01,CrRAR,lol
26-06-2020T23:54:04,CrRAR,;_;
26-06-2020T23:54:18,CrRAR,I blame Trace
26-06-2020T23:54:20,RimaDraws,am i the only one who cherished rose's character
26-06-2020T23:54:33,Ordithus,no not at all
26-06-2020T23:54:44,AspiringNoodle,"Welp, ladies and gents, and ghosts"
26-06-2020T23:54:58,AspiringNoodle,Get prepped for Laura 2: Pupper spoopaloo
26-06-2020T23:55:27,CrRAR,:ptv-confused:
26-06-2020T23:55:51,RimaDraws,hm
26-06-2020T23:56:06,CrRAR,What did you expect to happen rima?
26-06-2020T23:56:26,RimaDraws,i didn't expect her to be already dead...
26-06-2020T23:59:00,CrRAR,"Well, she can still do most things she could do if she was alive, mostly what I get from this, if it‚Äôs Trace‚Äôs doing iis that it proves how a deranged lunatic Trace was."
26-06-2020T23:59:29,RimaDraws,hmph
26-06-2020T23:59:54,Ordithus,and possibly that his messed up projects work
