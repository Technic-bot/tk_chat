13-08-2020T20:16:03,Rosscoe,Burn the fridge
13-08-2020T20:16:07,swedishkitsune,reminds me of the Cowboy Bebop ep
13-08-2020T20:16:24,swedishkitsune,where the lobster in the fridge turns into a monster after being forgotten in there
13-08-2020T20:16:27,BadFoMo,Haha! I was thighing the same thing!
13-08-2020T20:16:29,SageSaga,I knew he was going home a while ago but i never heard if he had to be quarantined or anything like that- and i dont get to chat with Chalo much so i figured I'd say something now

13-08-2020T20:17:50,SageSaga,the minimum quarantine time for this is 2 weeks
13-08-2020T20:19:13,Rosscoe,Sadly people that come in for food do not get that concept still.

13-08-2020T21:05:37,NezumiYuki,OMG I'm suddenly seeing a very thicc Lady Nora from Zro's response xD
13-08-2020T21:05:42,ZRO4825,"Yeah, but Reni's too adorkable to call a damn dirty cheater."
13-08-2020T21:05:42,BADBackgroundProductions,Maddie is starting to seem a bit stalkerish isn’t she
13-08-2020T21:05:54,CrRAR,s-starting?
13-08-2020T21:06:00,ZRO4825,She's a spy. She's been a professional stalker from the start. :P
13-08-2020T21:06:12,IronHorseComics,and a professional creep
13-08-2020T21:06:17,ZRO4825,"No, that's Eric."

13-08-2020T21:06:38,IronHorseComics,"oh fine, a Mister Miracle wannabe then"
13-08-2020T21:06:41,NezumiYuki,Agreed with Zro... Eric is a professional creeper.  xDD   But and adorable one at that.
13-08-2020T21:06:59,NezumiYuki,but an adorable one*
13-08-2020T21:07:17,ZRO4825,I like that he's becoming a better person. He's still a creeper. But he's at least attempting to become a better one...morally speaking.
13-08-2020T21:07:31,CrRAR,so noble
13-08-2020T21:07:33,IronHorseComics,"Mister Miracle, a DC superhero that's the world's best escape artist, yes children, he's even better at it than Batman"

13-08-2020T21:07:56,KeefMcDerpface,MAGIC
13-08-2020T21:08:02,ZRO4825,Pretty sure snorkels have been a thing as long as someone's been able to hollow a tube.
13-08-2020T21:08:22,CrRAR,bamboo snorkel
13-08-2020T21:08:27,NezumiYuki,"Background, Asian countries used bamboo reeds as snorkles for like... ages.... TwoKinds having them isn't out of the question."

13-08-2020T21:08:45,NezumiYuki,Yea Rar gets it

13-08-2020T21:19:28,CrRAR,you can talk through a bot account
13-08-2020T21:19:47,iliar,Because bots are cool.

13-08-2020T21:35:12,SageSaga,i see them more as a challenge than something to hate- a challenge of how to overcome them either by finding ways to not draw them- to finding out how to make them look as good as i can
13-08-2020T21:35:38,Nekonny,yeah
13-08-2020T21:35:54,Nekonny,I feel lie it ends up taking me longer

13-08-2020T21:37:08,Combak,To be clear: I was joking. A more likely method is to just practice it and get used to it.
13-08-2020T21:37:38,Nekonny,The background element is meh
13-08-2020T21:37:49,NezumiYuki,"I can relate, Ron.... oh I can relate"

13-08-2020T21:38:20,Nekonny,I suppose it could be more fun if it didn't take as long
13-08-2020T21:38:31,Nekonny,or the end result actually looked good
13-08-2020T21:38:45,NezumiYuki,Them feels Ron... them feels*
13-08-2020T21:38:52,Nekonny,I really don't want to spens 6 hours painting a background if its going to be covered up
13-08-2020T21:39:07,Nekonny,There are techniques I imagine for makign them look good
13-08-2020T21:39:07,SageSaga,the background you have there- the only thing i dont really like in it is probably the trees
13-08-2020T21:39:22,Nekonny,the trees are a bit of a stand in atm
13-08-2020T21:39:25,CrimsonHelsing,Pffft xD lmao! Ohh Maddie
13-08-2020T21:39:27,NezumiYuki,why does perspective and all that jazz have to be so freakin difficult to pull off?   I mean I get the idea of convergent lines for focus... but.... blarg!
13-08-2020T21:39:51,Nekonny,although I end up buring the thing to heck and at that point it doesnt matter anyomore
13-08-2020T21:39:52,CrimsonHelsing,So she was the one snorkeling
13-08-2020T21:39:59,Nekonny,*bluring
13-08-2020T21:40:19,SageSaga,i hate blurred out backgrounds

13-08-2020T21:40:53,Nekonny,it looks worse without it
13-08-2020T21:40:54,SageSaga,most people do it seems- since almost everyone turns off DoF and Motion blur in games XD
13-08-2020T21:41:11,NezumiYuki,LOL silly cheat of an idea but how about using the powwah of PhotoShop to blur the fek out of photos and use that as convenient backgrounds?   xDD
13-08-2020T21:41:15,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-sleepoverA:
13-08-2020T21:41:55,SageSaga,Nezumi- because its more work to make that look like it belongs unless your picture is near photo real?
13-08-2020T21:41:56,ZRO4825,I hate DoF in games. In pictures it's...sometimes okay.
13-08-2020T21:42:14,Twokinds,It depends
13-08-2020T21:42:15,Nekonny,It requires a lerain level of abstaction that just hasn't clicked yet in me
13-08-2020T21:42:16,CrRAR,solutions to backgrounds: more face closeups
13-08-2020T21:42:16,NezumiYuki,Ahhh yeah... good point Sage... didn't consider that...
13-08-2020T21:42:41,Twokinds,I don't use it often but it is useful when you want to push things back
13-08-2020T21:42:56,CrRAR,tru
13-08-2020T21:42:58,NezumiYuki,makes note of this*
13-08-2020T21:42:59,hyneria,what about renders for backgrounds? I've seen many artists do those
13-08-2020T21:43:13,hyneria,But Ive heard making renders is really time consuming too
13-08-2020T21:43:15,Combak,"Ron: If you hate how some of the background will be blocked out, just don't draw that part? You know, draw characters first, block out speech bubbles, then draw the BG?"
13-08-2020T21:43:28,Combak,"Renders do take a while to process, yes."
13-08-2020T21:43:41,Combak,And sometimes it can look kinda... bad.
13-08-2020T21:43:42,Twokinds,I used a blurred background here to keep focus on the characters
13-08-2020T21:43:57,CrRAR,such scale
13-08-2020T21:43:58,hyneria,I've seen some people do blender stuff that looks like it was hand painted
13-08-2020T21:44:08,SageSaga,DoF is certainly a tool to use- but i think when you do a single picture people prefer to be able to focus on what they want
13-08-2020T21:44:12,CrRAR,very perilous
13-08-2020T21:44:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,That laser splosion looks so good
13-08-2020T21:44:17,NezumiYuki,LOL I guess Reni has officially earned a new nickname from me*    Princess BFG9000

13-08-2020T21:44:27,CrRAR,yis
13-08-2020T21:44:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Rima
13-08-2020T21:44:39,Nekonny,DOF?
13-08-2020T21:44:45,SageSaga,Depth of Field
13-08-2020T21:44:48,hyneria,Depth of field
13-08-2020T21:45:05,Nekonny,oh
13-08-2020T21:45:30,Nekonny,I guess part of it is also planning the whole scene out
13-08-2020T21:45:52,Nekonny,"settig the character with the correct perspectives, etc"
13-08-2020T21:45:59,SageSaga,DoF is used to draw your attention
13-08-2020T21:46:12,Nekonny,its much easier to get away with that sort of thing when drawing a character
13-08-2020T21:46:28,Nekonny,bad background perspective can runin a drawing
13-08-2020T21:47:02,hyneria,"Backgrounds add a lot to a drawing, tho"
13-08-2020T21:47:04,SageSaga,there's lots of bad perspectives that also surprisingly do nothing because no one is focused on them XD
13-08-2020T21:47:30,Nekonny,"Is DOF a liging thing as well, or just focus?"
13-08-2020T21:47:37,SageSaga,just focus
13-08-2020T21:47:45,hyneria,focus distance
13-08-2020T21:48:26,Nekonny,hum
13-08-2020T21:48:46,Nekonny,how to partially blur somehthing
13-08-2020T21:49:03,NezumiYuki,Palpatine:  Learn perspective lines... It gives you 'focus' !
13-08-2020T21:49:14,SageSaga,hmmm- i wonder-
13-08-2020T21:49:44,hyneria,May I link a guide to Depth of Field?
13-08-2020T21:50:02,Nekonny,sure
13-08-2020T21:50:11,Nekonny,(hungry all of a sudden...)
13-08-2020T21:50:14,hyneria,https://photographylife.com/what-is-depth-of-field
13-08-2020T21:50:16,CrRAR,it's like an element of photography
13-08-2020T21:50:32,CrRAR,has a lot to do with f-stops and whatnot
13-08-2020T21:50:34,hyneria,"This talks about photo DOF, but it can be applied to art or 3d too"
13-08-2020T21:51:02,SageSaga,that can kinda work-
13-08-2020T21:51:52,CrRAR,I got cereal

13-08-2020T21:52:55,hyneria,I only have krispy kreme donuts my roommate bought
13-08-2020T21:52:59,Dadrobit,Just made a chicken sandwich on toasted rye with some Dijon mustard. All the tasty.
13-08-2020T21:53:04,Dadrobit,"Also, howdy y'all/"
13-08-2020T21:53:04,CrRAR,wow

13-08-2020T21:53:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,DADDY
13-08-2020T21:53:10,Nekonny,that doesnt change the backgrounds much
13-08-2020T21:53:20,CrRAR,that's delicious and it was just words
13-08-2020T21:53:26,NezumiYuki,"""Pardon me, but, would you have any Grey Pupon?"""
13-08-2020T21:53:27,SageSaga,what doesnt?
13-08-2020T21:53:36,steelabjur,Howdy robit!
13-08-2020T21:53:37,hyneria,"I think Nekonny, you should plan the scene first before drawing the character?"
13-08-2020T21:53:47,hyneria,at least make some perspective lines?
13-08-2020T21:54:07,hyneria,that way you will avoid having your character look like it is standing in front of a wallpaper
13-08-2020T21:54:24,Dadrobit,"Grey Poupon. Man, you think I'm made of money?"
13-08-2020T21:54:29,NezumiYuki,It's funny when I look back on it... But about the time that GrayPupon became popular.... regular yellow mustard was instantly neglected by everyone.   xD
13-08-2020T21:54:46,CrRAR,shameeee
13-08-2020T21:54:46,hyneria,I've seen Chalo sketches the overall scene before adding characters on his comic pages
13-08-2020T21:54:49,Nekonny,the amount of work on the backgrounds
13-08-2020T21:54:50,Nekonny,brb
13-08-2020T21:54:51,ZRO4825,I'm not sure if I'm more jealous of Kate or Michelle right now :V
13-08-2020T21:54:54,Nekonny,snack
13-08-2020T21:54:56,SageSaga,Ron- What doesnt change the background much?
13-08-2020T21:54:58,Dadrobit,(Can't stand yellow mustard)
13-08-2020T21:55:11,Nekonny,the amount of work
13-08-2020T21:55:12,hyneria,I think Nekonny wants faster/easier bgs
13-08-2020T21:55:27,Nekonny,truth is
13-08-2020T21:55:34,SageSaga,you just gotta paint it is the fastest way ive found
13-08-2020T21:55:36,Nekonny,its hard because i dont know how
13-08-2020T21:55:51,SageSaga,doing lineart and all that is a huge pain for backgrounds
13-08-2020T21:55:56,SageSaga,but painting is sooooo much easier
13-08-2020T21:56:16,CrRAR,abstract yet pretty~
13-08-2020T21:56:17,hyneria,Try photobashing?
13-08-2020T21:56:41,NezumiYuki,Oh gods Tom!   That second page... forth panel... can sooooooo be taken out of context!  xD

13-08-2020T22:46:34,SageSaga,the main thing i dont like from Godai is when he draws human faces the same way he does anthros

13-08-2020T23:59:12,hyneria,"Maybe I am getting the comic wrong, but I think Nyna is not just a regular catgirl with a bad attitude. But a propr monster that can be pretty dangerous to mess with."
13-08-2020T23:59:50,ZRO4825,You're not wrong!
13-08-2020T23:59:56,ZRO4825,But she's a demi-human.
