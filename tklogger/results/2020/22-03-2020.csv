22-03-2020T16:01:09,AspiringNoodle,"Also, fun fact, our store does not have a lottery machine"
22-03-2020T16:01:47,AspiringNoodle,"So, while we would still have to handle any winners up to a certain limit, we're still hand picking / printing tickets for customers.  Or running slips."

22-03-2020T21:05:06,IronHorseComics,it's not something you learn overnight
22-03-2020T21:05:10,IronHorseComics,I can promise you that
22-03-2020T21:05:58,BlackjacksSec99,lol oh I get that. Im happy that at least it seems better than my drawings with pen and paper... Ive got a LOT to learn and I dont really know where to start
22-03-2020T21:08:40,IronHorseComics,start small
22-03-2020T21:08:44,IronHorseComics,simple shapes
22-03-2020T21:12:33,SpazztasticKiwi,the only bit of digital I do is on my phone

22-03-2020T21:19:38,BlackjacksSec99,"yeah, im going to be watching ALL the 'how to draw' youtubes till I start up college again in the fall. IF they have college in the fall :/"
22-03-2020T21:19:49,AspiringNoodle,"blackjack, I have a suggestion :D"
22-03-2020T21:19:59,BlackjacksSec99,yes! suggestions welcome!
22-03-2020T21:20:08,AspiringNoodle,Udemy has LOTS of courses available
22-03-2020T21:20:28,AspiringNoodle,"They're generally in the range of $10 - $20, the prices fluctuate"
22-03-2020T21:20:45,BlackjacksSec99,*googling*

22-03-2020T21:22:16,Ordithus,Is game.  Classic series with a new entry.
22-03-2020T21:22:29,AspiringNoodle,The Ultimate Drawing Course - Beginner to Advanced
22-03-2020T21:22:32,AspiringNoodle,That's one I bought
22-03-2020T21:22:48,BlackjacksSec99,it works with digital too?
22-03-2020T21:23:05,BlackjacksSec99,i mean you can learn using digital even though they are showing pen and paper?
22-03-2020T21:23:27,AspiringNoodle,Digital = tool
22-03-2020T21:23:52,AspiringNoodle,"The basics will translate anywhere.  Hell, all digital art software has tools that mimic traditional tools"
22-03-2020T21:24:19,BlackjacksSec99,true...
22-03-2020T21:24:21,AspiringNoodle,"Arguably, it's a lot easier to learn with pencil and paper, because you're looking at what you're drawing"
22-03-2020T21:24:42,BlackjacksSec99,ive got to spend some time learning PS as well.
22-03-2020T21:24:45,AspiringNoodle,"With digital, unless you have a screen you'll also be trying to establish hand-eye coordination at the same time"
22-03-2020T21:25:27,BlackjacksSec99,"actually... one of the few lessons that I remember from my junior high art class was drawing while not looking at the page, its kind of helped me here already, I dont have any issue with it really"
22-03-2020T21:26:05,AspiringNoodle,"If you take art classes in a college setting, they'll say to step back every once in a while"
22-03-2020T21:26:08,BlackjacksSec99,"teacher had us draw a person, who was laying on a table, without looking at our paper once"
22-03-2020T21:26:51,AspiringNoodle,Stepping back from your work allows you to see the overall image and figure out if things need adjusted
22-03-2020T21:27:02,BlackjacksSec99,"thats why we see tom zoom out-in-out-in on occasion, I get that"
22-03-2020T21:27:25,AspiringNoodle,"As for not looking at your drawing, never had any exercises like that, so I can't really comment on it"
22-03-2020T21:27:34,AspiringNoodle,But I will say that speed exercises can help
22-03-2020T21:27:34,BlackjacksSec99,it was... interesting
22-03-2020T21:27:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I know it’s a game
22-03-2020T21:28:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I watched Seán play it for a video for his first time trying it
22-03-2020T21:28:12,AspiringNoodle,"So, once you get the hang of things, if you seem to hit a wall, try practicing sketching something knew"
22-03-2020T21:28:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t get the fuss
22-03-2020T21:28:16,AspiringNoodle,But you only got 30 seconds
22-03-2020T21:28:17,BlackjacksSec99,all i know about it is someting about a capitalist overlord raccoon
22-03-2020T21:28:17,AspiringNoodle,ANDGO
22-03-2020T21:28:27,BlackjacksSec99,oooooooo
22-03-2020T21:28:36,BlackjacksSec99,yeah that would be a challange
22-03-2020T21:28:51,AspiringNoodle,"Not even joking, my basic drawing course did that xD"
22-03-2020T21:29:16,AspiringNoodle,"The pictures looked absolutely awful, but you got better because it forced you to learn how to analyze an image more quickly to efficiently translate it to the page"
22-03-2020T21:29:42,BlackjacksSec99,i watched someone do it as a example of why you shouldnt complain at the cost/time it takes artists to do commisions
22-03-2020T21:30:06,BlackjacksSec99,10 seconds v 1 minute v 10 minutes
22-03-2020T21:31:11,AspiringNoodle,"Heck, look at tom"
22-03-2020T21:31:25,AspiringNoodle,He can finish most images in 1 - 2 hours at a very good level of detail
22-03-2020T21:31:35,AspiringNoodle,"""He only spent an hour on it!"""
22-03-2020T21:31:45,AspiringNoodle,"""No, he spent 16 friggin' years on it"""
22-03-2020T21:32:03,BlackjacksSec99,"yes, exactly"
22-03-2020T21:32:11,BlackjacksSec99,theres a story like that that I love
22-03-2020T21:32:12,CrRAR,Tom used ART
22-03-2020T21:32:15,CrRAR,It’s super effective!
22-03-2020T21:32:23,AspiringNoodle,"It's the one about Picasso, yeh? c:"
22-03-2020T21:32:31,BlackjacksSec99,"nope, its about a mechanic"

22-03-2020T21:32:40,AspiringNoodle,STORY TIME :popcorn:
22-03-2020T21:33:03,BlackjacksSec99,one day a big ship's engine stopped working. I mean BIG.... like cruise ship.

22-03-2020T21:33:17,BlackjacksSec99,"the crew couldnt figure it out, even after a week"
22-03-2020T21:33:25,BlackjacksSec99,"so, they call in a mechanic"
22-03-2020T21:33:50,BlackjacksSec99,the mechanic arrives and looks at the whole thing for an hour or two but he doesnt touch any thing
22-03-2020T21:34:26,BlackjacksSec99,finally he goes to his tool box and pulls out a 5 ounce hammer
22-03-2020T21:34:48,BlackjacksSec99,he approaches one of the many mechanical devices and gently taps it twice
22-03-2020T21:34:58,CrRAR,“This is ‘ow we fix things in Soviet... Russia”
22-03-2020T21:35:00,BlackjacksSec99,the engine starts and runs smoothly
