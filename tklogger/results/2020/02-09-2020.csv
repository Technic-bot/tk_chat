02-09-2020T00:02:16,SpazztasticKiwi,she said sheâ€™d come by to look at the store cakes to get one wrote on
02-09-2020T00:02:32,SpazztasticKiwi,after I got through to her that what she wanted wasnâ€™t happening
02-09-2020T00:02:52,SpazztasticKiwi,no matter how many times she repeated
02-09-2020T00:03:19,CrRAR,she could buy a unicorn figurine and stick it in the cake
02-09-2020T00:03:42,CrRAR,:unicorn::ptv-excited:
02-09-2020T00:04:40,CrRAR,"ohhh, woould you draw a rainbow on it on request as 'writing'?"
02-09-2020T00:04:51,CrRAR,or is that too much to do?
02-09-2020T00:05:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I can write happy birthday and a name
02-09-2020T00:05:48,CrRAR,can you write happy birthday in the COLORS of a rainbow?
02-09-2020T00:05:56,SpazztasticKiwi,thereâ€™s star tips I can make stars or dots and stuff but any design sheâ€™d have to order
02-09-2020T00:06:10,CrRAR,ah I see
02-09-2020T00:06:15,SpazztasticKiwi,she never came back
02-09-2020T00:06:19,CrRAR,aww
02-09-2020T00:06:39,CrRAR,can you do lil clouds?
02-09-2020T00:06:55,CrRAR,some of this is probably limited by store policy I know xD
02-09-2020T00:06:58,AspiringNoodle,or happy lil' trees?
02-09-2020T00:07:02,SpazztasticKiwi,she came in when I went to break but never came back later
02-09-2020T00:07:14,CrRAR,dang it
02-09-2020T00:07:19,CrRAR,oh well
02-09-2020T00:07:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Iâ€™ve had no need to do anything beyond happy birthday with a name
02-09-2020T00:07:44,CrRAR,I guess unicorns are elusive as they say~

02-09-2020T00:10:47,AspiringNoodle,Time to do some horrific visions in WoW
02-09-2020T00:10:57,AspiringNoodle,"20 - 30 minutes a run, and the Stormwind version is a royal pita"
02-09-2020T00:10:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I had purple out already so I filled in the spaces
02-09-2020T00:11:13,AspiringNoodle,pretty purple points~
02-09-2020T00:11:22,CrRAR,the letters remind me of twizzlers
02-09-2020T00:11:37,SpazztasticKiwi,but Iâ€™ve wrote in that flower tip before
02-09-2020T00:12:14,SpazztasticKiwi,the bigger cakes have the room
02-09-2020T00:12:31,SpazztasticKiwi,otherwise itâ€™s the round tip
02-09-2020T00:14:24,CrRAR,"ah yes, classiq fine point~"
02-09-2020T00:22:15,CrRAR,I wonder if they wanted a square cake so it resembled a meme or something
02-09-2020T00:22:38,CrRAR,dang internet skewing popular opinion of what a cake is
02-09-2020T00:42:53,CrRAR,"Did you get food, noodle?"
02-09-2020T00:47:00,AspiringNoodle,not yet... doing a vision of stormwind
02-09-2020T00:47:09,AspiringNoodle,holy hell is this one infinitely more frustrating...
02-09-2020T00:51:52,AspiringNoodle,not sure what it is about Stormwind's vision... maybe because it's not as linear (the city can be mazelike for some objectives)
02-09-2020T00:52:03,AspiringNoodle,Or maybe some of the bosses have more frustrating mechanics
02-09-2020T00:52:43,AspiringNoodle,...okay I get food
02-09-2020T01:05:35,CrRAR,"okay 2AM shower accomplished, cuz what does time matter anymore."
