28-01-2020T13:32:39,CrimsonQuill,Hi there Spazz
28-01-2020T13:40:17,SonOfGoku,Hi Quill
28-01-2020T13:45:33,CrimsonQuill,Hi SonOfGoku
28-01-2020T14:24:26,AspiringNoodle,Howdy howdy howdy everyone :ptv-greetings:
28-01-2020T14:31:28,CrimsonQuill,Hiya Aspiring
28-01-2020T14:33:17,AspiringNoodle,"Yesterday I had my first ""I don't want to deal with people today"" day"
28-01-2020T14:33:41,AspiringNoodle,"It faded about halfway through my shift, but yay for forced human contact jobs~"
28-01-2020T14:34:24,CrimsonQuill,Sheesh
28-01-2020T14:34:34,CrimsonQuill,I feel ya
28-01-2020T14:35:24,AspiringNoodle,"TBH, I don't think it was entirely that"
28-01-2020T14:35:41,AspiringNoodle,"It was, ""I don't want to have to do the checklist AND deal with customers"" day"
28-01-2020T14:35:57,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, hate that effing checklist.  It's so freaking outdated"
28-01-2020T14:37:02,AspiringNoodle,"It's basically a list of ""do this, do that, do it every shift every day, with some exceptions for third since we don't really want them going outside"""
28-01-2020T14:37:29,AspiringNoodle,"But... not everything NEEDS done on every shift, not unless you want to waste time and/or resources."
28-01-2020T14:37:43,AspiringNoodle,"And some stuff isn't a once and done, it should be done constantly throughout the shift."
28-01-2020T14:38:29,AspiringNoodle,This place is slowly grinding my gears :ptv-unimpressed:
28-01-2020T14:38:51,CrimsonQuill,"With me, I just don't have enough time on my shift to do everything I need, and I sometimes stay over the end (and no overtime)."
28-01-2020T14:39:15,AspiringNoodle,So you work off the clock?
28-01-2020T14:39:19,CrimsonQuill,My manager is looking to get my shift extended by 1/2 an hour so that I'm not under so much pressure
28-01-2020T14:39:34,CrimsonQuill,We use a clock in machine
28-01-2020T14:39:45,CrimsonQuill,But are only paid as per our shift
28-01-2020T14:40:39,AspiringNoodle,And if you can't finish your stuff before leaving you get written up / penaltied?
28-01-2020T14:42:10,CrimsonQuill,"No, I just don't get paid for the time I spent finishing up"
28-01-2020T14:42:26,CrimsonQuill,I'm generally on my own after 6:00pm in the kitchen
28-01-2020T14:42:52,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, that's not so bad then"
28-01-2020T14:43:03,CrimsonQuill,"My shift ends at 7:30, but it can and often does take longer to finish the dishes, empty the last few bins, shine the sinks, drain the dishwasher...."
28-01-2020T14:43:05,AspiringNoodle,"I was about to go ""That reeks of federal labor law violations"""
28-01-2020T14:45:04,AspiringNoodle,I should mention that I only work 3 days a week at this place now
28-01-2020T14:45:16,AspiringNoodle,Not sure if I should be happy or upset that the days are spread out
28-01-2020T14:45:42,AspiringNoodle,"Normal person schedule: I work Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday"
28-01-2020T14:45:55,AspiringNoodle,"Weird place schedule: I work Saturday, Tuesday, Thursday"
28-01-2020T14:46:53,CrimsonQuill,Okay...aren't those the same days though?
28-01-2020T14:51:56,AspiringNoodle,"yes, but our schedule starts on friday :P"
28-01-2020T14:52:05,AspiringNoodle,"Because weekends are meaningless, lol"
28-01-2020T14:54:41,CrimsonQuill,Aaaah.
28-01-2020T14:55:20,AspiringNoodle,"Like I said, don't know whether to be happy or upset about the fact that all the days I work are spread out"
28-01-2020T14:56:00,AspiringNoodle,"Part of me is like, ""YEAH, A DAY OFF AFTER EACH SHIFT!"""
28-01-2020T14:56:15,AspiringNoodle,"The other is like, ""Bleh, just group 'em all together and let me enjoy a super long weekend"""
28-01-2020T14:56:24,CrimsonQuill,I find myself better with the latter option.
28-01-2020T14:58:50,AspiringNoodle,I'm gonna talk with my 2nd boss
28-01-2020T14:59:04,AspiringNoodle,"As it stands, I update the app twice a month on the 15th and final days"
28-01-2020T14:59:21,CrimsonQuill,Oh I see
28-01-2020T14:59:35,AspiringNoodle,"Part of the reason is that the app was ignoring start dates on the coupons.  But if that was fixed up, then I don't need to reserve those days"
28-01-2020T14:59:51,CrimsonQuill,That's good here.
28-01-2020T15:00:23,AspiringNoodle,"And if I don't have this super weird availability, then maybe my days will get clustered together"
28-01-2020T15:01:03,CrimsonQuill,"It is nicer overall to have a cluster of days together.,"
28-01-2020T15:08:41,AspiringNoodle,I would probably agree with that statement
28-01-2020T15:08:48,AspiringNoodle,What I believe is best above all is consistency
28-01-2020T15:09:18,AspiringNoodle,This job doesn't schedule out more than a week in advance.  So at best you'll know what next week's schedule is once the current week starts
28-01-2020T15:09:35,CrimsonQuill,My schedule is kind of hard to get too
28-01-2020T15:09:47,AspiringNoodle,"But ofc, company policy is that they want 3 weeks notice for any requests :P"
28-01-2020T15:09:55,CrimsonQuill,The manager's trying to get a roster for the next fortnight
28-01-2020T15:11:59,AspiringNoodle,I feel like part of the reason a lot of jobs are so horrible is that they are somewhat unreasonable in terms of a long-term job / career
28-01-2020T15:12:54,AspiringNoodle,"Who wants to make a career where your days / hours can change constantly, and you get almost no advance notice to changes?"
28-01-2020T15:13:52,AspiringNoodle,"That said, where I work is pretty decent about sticking to a schedule.  The only time a schedule changes is if there was a mistake and it violated someone's availability, but that's usually fixed in a day of being notified"
28-01-2020T15:14:22,AspiringNoodle,"Other than that, usual retail bs.  Someone didn't show or called off, so they see if anyone's available :P"
28-01-2020T15:14:46,CrimsonQuill,I see
28-01-2020T15:14:56,CrimsonQuill,Another day in Paradise then
28-01-2020T15:15:10,AspiringNoodle,"Also, pray for my manager.  Night guy didn't show last night, so he had to eat the 10 - 6"
28-01-2020T15:15:17,AspiringNoodle,And today was supposed to be his day off xD
28-01-2020T15:15:35,CrimsonQuill,Consider a prayer sent-poor chap
28-01-2020T15:16:08,AspiringNoodle,"It's funny, he was trying to get me out of there, and I was like, ""After I finish checking the expirations on this last row."""
28-01-2020T15:16:29,AspiringNoodle,"I thought it was 11:15 or so, was actually 11:45 xD"
28-01-2020T15:17:28,AspiringNoodle,"yeah... once I start doing something, I will keep doing until I'm satisfied and can say ""enough for now"" :ptv-uneasy:"
28-01-2020T15:18:17,AspiringNoodle,"Not really the kind of temperament / personality for a job that is best described as for people with ADD, lol"
28-01-2020T15:18:32,CrimsonQuill,Like me...
28-01-2020T15:18:50,CrimsonQuill,I just can't go on break until I've finished washing everything around me
28-01-2020T15:19:09,AspiringNoodle,"I don't take breaks at work, lol"
28-01-2020T15:19:45,AspiringNoodle,"Which sucks because I don't take breaks unless there's nothing (at least to me) to do, and there's no customers.  And there are no assigned breaks"
28-01-2020T15:19:57,CrimsonQuill,That sucks
28-01-2020T15:19:59,CrimsonQuill,Well
28-01-2020T15:20:10,CrimsonQuill,We are told we have at least a 1/2 hour per shift
28-01-2020T15:20:18,CrimsonQuill,1 hour for those with a 12 hour or longer
28-01-2020T15:21:57,AspiringNoodle,"It's a shame, really"
28-01-2020T15:22:12,AspiringNoodle,I'm clearly the only one checking the dates on stuff that lasts forever
28-01-2020T15:22:25,AspiringNoodle,"Fresh case, don't need to worry too much"
28-01-2020T15:22:28,CrimsonQuill,That's dedication
28-01-2020T15:22:46,AspiringNoodle,"Baked goods?  If it's hand dated, same deal."
28-01-2020T15:22:58,AspiringNoodle,"But stuff like chips, candy, and jerky?  Good fucking luck"
28-01-2020T15:23:12,AspiringNoodle,"Back in October, I cleaned the ENTIRE store of expired stuff"
28-01-2020T15:23:28,AspiringNoodle,Found a tiny container of ranch that was dated for 5 - 7 months ago
28-01-2020T15:23:29,CrimsonQuill,Wheesh
28-01-2020T15:23:37,AspiringNoodle,Found a bag of sunflower seeds dated for DEC 2017
28-01-2020T15:23:37,CrimsonQuill,How long did it take?
28-01-2020T15:24:00,AspiringNoodle,Found a bunch of other stuff that expired anywhere from that month to the beginning of the year
28-01-2020T15:24:14,AspiringNoodle,"3 - 4 shifts, taking up half my shift, and me giving the finger to the damned checklist"
28-01-2020T15:24:48,CrimsonQuill,Good Go
28-01-2020T15:24:49,CrimsonQuill,God
28-01-2020T15:24:51,CrimsonQuill,Argh
28-01-2020T15:24:54,AspiringNoodle,"Thanks to corporate cutting hours, I man the store solo for the last 1.5 - 2 hours"
28-01-2020T15:24:57,CrimsonQuill,Painful!
28-01-2020T15:25:10,AspiringNoodle,"On the bright side, checking dates is one of the few things I can do during that time"
28-01-2020T15:25:26,AspiringNoodle,"And go fucking figure, I've found stuff that expired in November of last year, lmao"
28-01-2020T15:25:34,AspiringNoodle,"""Huh, I wonder if anyone che- NOPE."""
28-01-2020T15:26:10,AspiringNoodle,Not to mention people can't follow damned FIFO :ptv-uneasy:
28-01-2020T15:26:26,AspiringNoodle,I spend so much time just fixing the ordering of products ont he shelves :ptv-unimpressed:
28-01-2020T15:27:10,CrimsonQuill,I see that in shops all the time.
28-01-2020T15:27:23,CrimsonQuill,"People take stuff from one place, but put it in another."
28-01-2020T15:27:29,CrimsonQuill,It hurts to see.
28-01-2020T15:27:36,AspiringNoodle,"Oh yeah, I fixed that too! lol"
28-01-2020T15:27:52,AspiringNoodle,People not paying attention to the product's size.  So they put large bags with small bags and vice-versa
28-01-2020T15:28:34,AspiringNoodle,"I've come to learn that ""productivity"" is a euphemism for ""do as much shit in as little time as possible"""
28-01-2020T15:28:52,AspiringNoodle,"Which ends up being shorthand for ""quantity over quality"""
28-01-2020T15:28:56,CrimsonQuill,"A whirlwind of stress, in other words."
28-01-2020T15:29:09,AspiringNoodle,You know corporate
28-01-2020T15:29:15,AspiringNoodle,Always obsessed with profit
28-01-2020T15:29:21,AspiringNoodle,Want as much as possible
28-01-2020T15:29:29,AspiringNoodle,Don't want to pay for the quality needed to keep it there
28-01-2020T15:30:17,CrimsonQuill,I feel a rant incoming
28-01-2020T15:30:23,CrimsonQuill,Let's talk about something else
28-01-2020T15:30:33,CrimsonQuill,Otherwise I'll fill the chat with walls of text...
28-01-2020T15:30:34,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, a rant from you? xD"
28-01-2020T15:30:57,AspiringNoodle,"Meh, it's the standard ""we're not happy with making a lot of money we want to make ALL the money"" schtick"
28-01-2020T15:31:19,AspiringNoodle,That train of thought is working WONDERS for the games industry at the moment :ptv-snicker:
28-01-2020T15:31:55,CrimsonQuill,"Seriously, What the FUCK is wrong with those people? They sit all so plush and pimp in their half-arsed GODAWFUL furniture in STUPIDLY OVERPRICED HOMES while ONE FUCKING STREET AWAY there are poor sods who haven't even got a sleeping bag for themselves,"
28-01-2020T15:32:11,AspiringNoodle,"Oh no, I've triggered a rant :ptv-shock:"
28-01-2020T15:32:41,CrimsonQuill,"Just a piece of cardboard, and it's TOO MUCH to think about sustainable jobs, OH NO! Not long and stable, it has to be all MONEY MONEY MONEY and then crash, MONEYU crash MONEY crash IT GOES ON AND ON"
28-01-2020T15:33:29,AspiringNoodle,"On the bright side, I've decided that this company isn't worth working for."
28-01-2020T15:33:49,CrimsonQuill,"And of course, something works by providing actually decent customer service and good quality products/service/whatever? No, they can't be having that, can they, it's not making enough MONEY."
28-01-2020T15:33:50,AspiringNoodle,"Look at how a company treats its managers, and you'll get a feel for what it's really like."
28-01-2020T15:34:04,CrimsonQuill,"Money, power and sex. That's all they FUCKING CARE ABOUT."
28-01-2020T15:34:17,CrimsonQuill,I don't give a SHIT about their profit margins.
28-01-2020T15:34:26,CrimsonQuill,"I don't give a rat's arse about ""Investment"""
28-01-2020T15:34:28,AspiringNoodle,"Hehe, look at what happened to Home Depot"
28-01-2020T15:34:37,CrimsonQuill,And I DESPISE THEIR OVERSIZED FLIPPING HOMES
28-01-2020T15:34:39,CrimsonQuill,SERIOUSLY
28-01-2020T15:35:07,CrimsonQuill,HOUSES THE SIZE OF FUCKING FOOTBALL FIELDS! While in the city centres there are FAMILIES Cramped in 2-up-2-down buildings
28-01-2020T15:35:33,CrimsonQuill,And of course I could go ON and ON about the environmental and cultural impact of it all here and in other countries...
28-01-2020T15:35:38,CrimsonQuill,AAARGH
28-01-2020T15:35:47,CrimsonQuill,Someone stop me before I break the chat...

28-01-2020T15:36:23,CrimsonQuill,I just.
28-01-2020T15:36:25,CrimsonQuill,Really hate.
28-01-2020T15:36:32,CrimsonQuill,How shitty people can be.
28-01-2020T15:36:48,CrimsonQuill,Including myself.
28-01-2020T15:36:50,AspiringNoodle,"Like I said, look at how a company treats its managers"
28-01-2020T15:37:01,AspiringNoodle,My manager is salaried for about $48k a year
28-01-2020T15:37:06,AspiringNoodle,Doesn't seem so bad.
28-01-2020T15:37:22,AspiringNoodle,But they want him scheduled for a minimum of 48 hours a week.
28-01-2020T15:37:49,CrimsonQuill,"Bullshit, that's what that is. Absolute bullshit and buggery."
28-01-2020T15:38:01,CrimsonQuill,(Pardon my language)
28-01-2020T15:38:45,AspiringNoodle,The new owners of the chain also eliminated the 3 month raise for new hires
28-01-2020T15:38:51,AspiringNoodle,Which i understand is pretty standard
28-01-2020T15:38:52,CrimsonQuill,I feel really sorry for whoever opens the chat and just sees a wall of swearing and ranting...
28-01-2020T15:39:18,CrimsonQuill,3 month raise?
28-01-2020T15:41:31,AspiringNoodle,At a lot of hourly positions it's pretty standard to give new employees a raise after 3 months of service
28-01-2020T15:41:44,AspiringNoodle,Since these positions also tend to be ones with very high turnover rates

28-01-2020T15:51:56,tehbear,... market is 1/10 or 1/100 of projection
28-01-2020T15:52:00,tehbear,everyone is fired :(
28-01-2020T15:52:28,tehbear,could say its just capitalistic darwinism
28-01-2020T15:57:29,tehbear,I was wondering if there are any game companies that have a stable long term business model
28-01-2020T15:58:01,tehbear,"games are special in that they are subjective pieces of entertainment. its hard to predict what will be a hit, just like movies."
28-01-2020T16:00:15,tehbear,"i used to think Blizzard, Valve, Nintendo, Konami, Capcom were decent companies. They have their franchises, so working conditions should be stable"
28-01-2020T16:00:42,tehbear,otoh. maybe gamedevelopers become stale and lazy under such conditions :)
28-01-2020T16:01:39,tehbear,probably seems like a crazy person talking to himself
28-01-2020T16:16:15,AspiringNoodle,"Sorry, was busy in WoW"
28-01-2020T16:16:55,AspiringNoodle,"Nintendo is a good company.  CD Projekt Red.  Respawn (not even joking, they may be the developer that turns EA around). Bungie."
28-01-2020T16:17:19,AspiringNoodle,And just about every single fucking Indie dev that makes a great game.
28-01-2020T16:19:39,tehbear,"Respawn, the people behind Apex Legends? There was an article on how the project wasnt very well managed, kept changing direction"
28-01-2020T16:19:55,tehbear,"but then i never played the game, so maybe it ended good."
28-01-2020T16:20:07,AspiringNoodle,The game is pretty damn good for a battle royale
28-01-2020T16:20:24,AspiringNoodle,"I stopped playing, personally, because it's too unstable for my system"
28-01-2020T16:21:21,tehbear,"i want to develop my own games, so i try to not play games these days, but then im just lazy and watch movies and tv series instead"
28-01-2020T16:21:58,tehbear,gotta have a bit more self dicipline
28-01-2020T16:22:19,AspiringNoodle,Best advice I can give?  Play games
28-01-2020T16:22:23,AspiringNoodle,Play LOTS of games
28-01-2020T16:22:43,AspiringNoodle,Check out Extra Credits on Youtube for game dev stuff
28-01-2020T16:23:24,tehbear,"oh, break down / analysis of games, what makes them fun"
28-01-2020T16:24:04,tehbear,"good advice. this is what many actual game developers say, they play lots of games between working on them"
28-01-2020T16:24:56,tehbear,except Miyamoto. he does gardening or plays the banjo. well guess its essentially retired these days
28-01-2020T16:52:49,CrimsonQuill,returns
28-01-2020T16:53:12,CrimsonQuill,Heyo

28-01-2020T16:53:43,CrimsonQuill,I feel clean
28-01-2020T16:53:51,CrimsonQuill,Showers are good
28-01-2020T16:53:55,tehbear,:ctwokinds-katwet:
28-01-2020T16:53:58,CrimsonQuill,Second semester starts tomorrow
28-01-2020T16:54:03,CrimsonQuill,Lecture at 9:00am
28-01-2020T16:54:20,CrimsonQuill,"Need to be out of the house by 8:00, it's at least a 50 minute walk."
28-01-2020T16:54:31,tehbear,thats a long walk
28-01-2020T16:54:40,tehbear,i bicycle each day. 20 mins
28-01-2020T16:54:49,tehbear,would be about 50 mins by fot
28-01-2020T16:54:52,tehbear,foot
28-01-2020T16:55:48,CrimsonQuill,I need to get out more
28-01-2020T16:56:05,tehbear,i had a chemistry lecturer who started at 0800
28-01-2020T16:56:32,tehbear,many memories of feeling half a wake and hearing about Mols and avagardo
28-01-2020T16:56:48,tehbear,avogadro's number
28-01-2020T16:57:21,tehbear,"iirc, one teaspoon of water is circa 1 Mol of water molecules"
28-01-2020T16:57:57,CrimsonQuill,I find myself MORE tired after a lie in
28-01-2020T16:59:28,tehbear,actually a teaspoon is ca 1/4 Moles of water. so i guess a table spoon would be about rightish
28-01-2020T16:59:31,CrimsonQuill,Because I feel like my morning is the afternoon
28-01-2020T16:59:37,tehbear,"Quill, yes. Funny how that works."
28-01-2020T17:00:07,CrimsonQuill,"If I actually weren't so lazy, got up at 6:00am Every morning, I'd feel a lot better."
28-01-2020T17:00:19,CrimsonQuill,"It's a hard habit to break,"
28-01-2020T17:01:01,tehbear,bad habits are like a comfortable bed
28-01-2020T17:02:15,tehbear,i really need 8 hrs or i feel like a zombie rest of the day
28-01-2020T17:02:23,CrimsonQuill,Bad habits must-and shall-be broken.
28-01-2020T17:03:04,tehbear,thats a good rule to live by
28-01-2020T17:03:18,CrimsonQuill,I'm working on it
28-01-2020T17:03:26,CrimsonQuill,Many of my habits remain
28-01-2020T17:03:57,CrimsonQuill,But if Trevor Bayliss can make the world's first windup radio in his shed
28-01-2020T17:04:03,CrimsonQuill,I can break my bad habits
28-01-2020T17:05:20,tehbear,patent filed in 1992
28-01-2020T17:05:37,tehbear,i thought radious back in the 1920s and 30s were usually wind up?
28-01-2020T17:05:43,tehbear,radios*
28-01-2020T17:05:46,CrimsonQuill,I don't think so
28-01-2020T17:06:10,tehbear,hmm. i recall movies where they wind a crank before relaying a msg
28-01-2020T17:06:13,CrimsonQuill,Trevor Bayliss had the idea listening about how people in poorer countries couldn't afford radios
28-01-2020T17:06:26,CrimsonQuill,Let me look it up
28-01-2020T17:06:31,tehbear,radios use surprisingly little power
28-01-2020T17:06:50,tehbear,so it seems like a good way to build a radio
28-01-2020T17:07:10,CrimsonQuill,Yep
28-01-2020T17:07:27,tehbear,not that i would want to crank away for 30 seconds each morining just to hear the news
28-01-2020T17:07:29,CrimsonQuill,I actually learned about Mr Bayliss on Wallace and Gromit's world of Invention
28-01-2020T17:07:41,CrimsonQuill,"Great 6-episode series, that"
28-01-2020T17:07:48,tehbear,"but if i was poor, and it was my only source of info and entertainment then yes"
28-01-2020T17:08:10,tehbear,"oh, i like Wallace and Gromit and Shaun the sheep"
28-01-2020T17:08:14,tehbear,didnt know of that series
28-01-2020T17:10:00,CrimsonQuill,We watched it when it aired in 2010 on BBC 1
28-01-2020T17:15:14,tehbear,lots of odd inventions there. will check it out
28-01-2020T17:18:19,CrimsonQuill,:D
28-01-2020T17:18:30,CrimsonQuill,Going to play some MCC Reach and head to bed

28-01-2020T17:52:33,AspiringNoodle,"If I ever decide to become a game dev, I'm pretty effing set"
28-01-2020T17:52:42,AspiringNoodle,All I have to do is play the original zelda games :P
28-01-2020T17:53:15,AspiringNoodle,"...hmmm, maybe an on-rail shooter game... we don't have many of those these days"
28-01-2020T17:53:19,AspiringNoodle,I miss Star Fox :c
28-01-2020T18:02:02,AspiringNoodle,"#StarFoxFans, WHERE YOU AT?!?"
28-01-2020T18:13:34,AspiringNoodle,*just learned he lives near one of the only 17 remaining Old Country Buffets* :ptv-shock:
28-01-2020T18:15:32,tehbear,heh. funny coincidence but i actually want to make a starfaux
28-01-2020T18:16:26,tehbear,im completed the original Starfox snes version on SNES
28-01-2020T18:16:37,tehbear,but i have yet to complete the n64 one
28-01-2020T18:17:01,tehbear,the gamecube one doesnt count. it felt like a bad zelda to me
28-01-2020T18:17:25,tehbear,and ive seen there some new ones for WiiU and Switch but i didnt try them
28-01-2020T18:21:35,AspiringNoodle,"I liked Adventure, it was different and solidly made"
28-01-2020T18:21:50,AspiringNoodle,"Also, the N64 one is amazing"
28-01-2020T18:21:59,tehbear,i had just completed Master Quest that came on a companion disk with Wind Waker a tthe time
28-01-2020T18:22:08,AspiringNoodle,"Star Fox Assault is also good, its just too damn short"
28-01-2020T18:22:18,AspiringNoodle,And Star Fox Zero... eh
28-01-2020T18:22:43,AspiringNoodle,"It was more or less a remake of the first game from the N64 (which was a remake of the SNES version).  The Wii U is a dead platform, too"
28-01-2020T18:23:03,AspiringNoodle,"If they could alter the game to run on Switch, I would buy the Switch in a heartbeat"

28-01-2020T22:37:32,SpazztasticKiwi,but I mean I’m watching my charges so my new goodies will arrive next weekish

28-01-2020T22:41:19,Twokinds,Soooup
28-01-2020T22:41:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"only zombie that wants their brains cooked and served with a side of rice, grilled veggies and a drink"
28-01-2020T22:42:31,SpazztasticKiwi,well I don’t have soup but I do have leftovers for me later
28-01-2020T22:48:32,SpazztasticKiwi,guess that con crud really did take the kick out of you. shame.
28-01-2020T22:53:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"speaking of pep in the step, I had a customer the other night come in with ~way~ too much energy for 6-7 pm"
28-01-2020T22:57:01,AspiringNoodle,"Funny, same thing with my assistant manager yesterday at 3pm"
28-01-2020T22:57:18,AspiringNoodle,"I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I don't wanna deal with that much energy :P"
28-01-2020T22:59:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"you want to talk enthusiasm, I emailed fragrant jewels a simple question and it was like saying walk around a puppy"
28-01-2020T23:00:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"if there was a definition for full attention, it’s that automated response system and the gas station crackheads that can stare at you for 20 minutes"
28-01-2020T23:00:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"“Louie, blink - you’re scaring people”"
28-01-2020T23:12:01,AspiringNoodle,There's a cure for that
28-01-2020T23:12:06,AspiringNoodle,"It's called ""no loitering"" lmao"
28-01-2020T23:15:14,AspiringNoodle,Here's hoping my 2nd job gives more hours
28-01-2020T23:15:22,AspiringNoodle,Tired of working at a gas station already >_>
28-01-2020T23:52:08,SpazztasticKiwi,cuz having a hard time finding little formal wear for her boys
28-01-2020T23:52:42,SpazztasticKiwi,and the others having fun with clueless class group members
28-01-2020T23:56:25,SpazztasticKiwi,admittedly I can feel a bit of the latter’s pain - went to hs with a few blank tablets myself
