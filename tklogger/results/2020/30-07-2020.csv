30-07-2020T00:19:01,AspiringNoodle,Would probably be cheaper than buying frozen stuff

30-07-2020T00:21:23,UltraBondageFairy,I think it ended up with a much nicer aesthetic
30-07-2020T00:21:36,UltraBondageFairy,Although it is something I stole from another artist u3u

30-07-2020T12:27:41,AspiringNoodle,I think I freaked the 2nd invader out more than the first
30-07-2020T12:28:21,AspiringNoodle,"Quill was definitely helpful, even though it got him killed, but I was attacking in ways that he couldn't parry effectively"
30-07-2020T12:28:46,AspiringNoodle,"For twink invaders like him, they expect straight sword users to spam r1"
30-07-2020T12:29:06,AspiringNoodle,And it would more or less go down like this
30-07-2020T12:29:32,AspiringNoodle,r1 r1 (invader hits parry) r1 (parry lands) (invader ripostes)
30-07-2020T12:30:13,AspiringNoodle,"However, I did:"
30-07-2020T12:30:16,AspiringNoodle,r1 r1 r2
30-07-2020T12:30:47,AspiringNoodle,The heavy attack swaps up the timing and is used to attempt to roll catch somebody when they roll away after the stunlock
30-07-2020T12:30:58,AspiringNoodle,But it's also super useful for throwing off the parry timings of the invader
30-07-2020T12:45:16,CrRAR,hehehe

30-07-2020T20:09:05,SpazztasticKiwi,cats are prime apex predators

30-07-2020T20:10:18,SageSaga,that hasnt changed- ordered a new chair though that might help a bit supporting my hips and back better
30-07-2020T20:10:33,SageSaga,it was supposed to arrive Wednesday-
30-07-2020T20:10:49,SageSaga,Amazon still says I can expect it this past Wednesday
30-07-2020T20:10:59,Ordithus,um
30-07-2020T20:11:00,CrRAR,oh no
30-07-2020T20:11:04,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s not how time works
30-07-2020T20:11:12,CrRAR,Did it hop a train to some other state again?
30-07-2020T20:11:18,CrRAR,...and back?
30-07-2020T20:11:24,CrRAR,and then there again?
30-07-2020T20:11:27,Ordithus,do I need to look for it in the Virginia near me
30-07-2020T20:11:31,SpazztasticKiwi,did it get stuck at a delivery checkpoint
30-07-2020T20:11:41,CrRAR,Suspicious chair
30-07-2020T20:11:46,SageSaga,"if you look at tracking Amazon then says ""we dont have tracking information on this- but you can use this tracking number!"""
30-07-2020T20:11:50,SpazztasticKiwi,very suspicious
30-07-2020T20:11:50,SageSaga,"and im like ""wat"""
30-07-2020T20:12:00,SpazztasticKiwi,ups?
30-07-2020T20:12:01,CrRAR,wow
30-07-2020T20:12:04,SageSaga,yep
30-07-2020T20:12:25,SpazztasticKiwi,ups can track it too if you enter the number
30-07-2020T20:12:37,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe they actually have information
30-07-2020T20:12:39,SageSaga,so i checked the tracking and it says the label was printed Monday
30-07-2020T20:12:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"if not, the have chat"
30-07-2020T20:12:53,SageSaga,and that its set for 1 day air

30-07-2020T20:13:08,CrRAR,1 day ch-air
30-07-2020T20:13:10,SageSaga,but it hasnt been sent
30-07-2020T20:13:28,SageSaga,so i am upset
30-07-2020T20:13:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I called amazon & got an address change that only delayed the order by a day just this week
30-07-2020T20:13:45,SpazztasticKiwi,got it as expected
30-07-2020T20:13:47,CrRAR,yeah senders have more athority to reroute and whatnot
30-07-2020T20:14:33,SageSaga,that has nothing to do with my issue
30-07-2020T20:14:36,CrRAR,you could say that your customer experience so far has been... unsettling
30-07-2020T20:14:41,SpazztasticKiwi,would you be against maybe calling amazon to gril-I mean question them
30-07-2020T20:15:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d at least ask for a refund on the 1 day shipping since it’s obviously not
30-07-2020T20:15:29,Nekonny,o/

30-07-2020T21:20:09,SageSaga,but i think many people who have an allergy to treenuts might be more likely to also have a peanut allergy because they are similar in nature

30-07-2020T21:56:13,Mihari,She puts da buckets on da noggins!
30-07-2020T21:56:16,hyneria,It seems Rose didn't even knew her real body was in the garden
30-07-2020T21:56:21,BadFoMo,Oh no! She was probbably wearing her coverings when she saved Karen (didn't have time to take them off). that means that they're soked and she'll have to go... un-covered!
30-07-2020T21:56:22,SomethingSelfless,Because that would be rude.
30-07-2020T21:56:24,SomethingSelfless,Wot
30-07-2020T21:56:25,CrimsonHelsing,"Somehow, this makes less sense than having the boys or anyone below catch her"
30-07-2020T21:56:30,hyneria,"as she said like ""so there's where that thing was"""
30-07-2020T21:56:47,CrRAR,"yeah, though she seemed disgusted by it"
30-07-2020T21:56:56,SageSaga,Crim- how? Maddie has already been shown to basically be a ninja
30-07-2020T21:56:58,Mediawatcher,"Is it really? She was at the door the last time we saw her, it’s not too unreasonable to think she came in before this all started"
30-07-2020T21:57:14,CrRAR,She couldn't resist
30-07-2020T21:57:16,SomethingSelfless,↑
30-07-2020T21:57:19,SageSaga,its kinda her thing to appear and disappear
30-07-2020T21:57:22,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles: the boyssss
30-07-2020T21:57:23,hyneria,Yeah
30-07-2020T21:57:24,SomethingSelfless,↑↑
30-07-2020T21:57:30,Ordithus,:saxophone::ctwokinds-renirawr:
30-07-2020T21:57:32,BadFoMo,Running in water that deep isn't ease?
30-07-2020T21:57:34,Dragusthor,si
30-07-2020T21:57:39,hyneria,In fact I'd say iy would make no sense for her not to show up
30-07-2020T21:57:45,CrRAR,:cw0lfmare-SylvDJ:
30-07-2020T21:57:54,CrRAR,:saxophone::chipmunk:
30-07-2020T21:57:56,SomethingSelfless,Maddie defies all logic when it comes to her sneakiness
30-07-2020T21:58:07,Dragusthor,is it true why?
30-07-2020T21:58:12,SomethingSelfless,Wot
30-07-2020T21:58:18,SomethingSelfless,Is what true?
30-07-2020T21:59:02,CrimsonHelsing,"In any event, that eliminates Maddie from the list of unknowns. Now where's Lynn!"
30-07-2020T21:59:12,Dragusthor,because she in nothing
30-07-2020T21:59:21,Mediawatcher,Probably in his room
30-07-2020T21:59:26,CrRAR,:saxophone::ctwokinds-nibsdance:
30-07-2020T21:59:34,Nekonny,"well, I got to do everything that I needed to for the day ^^"""
30-07-2020T21:59:36,Mediawatcher,Also Maddie was last seen at the door in this page http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/1087/
30-07-2020T21:59:38,Ordithus,"he's notarizing all the illegal activities, very busy"
30-07-2020T21:59:47,Ordithus,"nice, ron"
30-07-2020T21:59:51,Ordithus,Ruby <3
30-07-2020T21:59:51,Nekonny,realized I was distracted by YT vid
30-07-2020T21:59:52,hyneria,I hope Sythe ends up saving Maren :P
30-07-2020T21:59:53,Roughlandin,Evening all!
30-07-2020T21:59:54,CrRAR,Lynn: holding onto Maddie's tail for extra steadyness
30-07-2020T21:59:54,Mediawatcher,So it’s obvious she came in before this whole insanity began
30-07-2020T22:00:01,KeefMcDerpface,hello Rough
30-07-2020T22:00:02,Mediawatcher,Same here hyneria
30-07-2020T22:00:04,Nekonny,I'll chat for a while then
30-07-2020T22:00:12,Roughlandin,Maddie to the rescue! Ha! Called it!
30-07-2020T22:00:18,CrRAR,whoop
30-07-2020T22:00:24,CrimsonHelsing,"What I want to know now is *everyone* in the estate being hunted/attacked? Or is it just everyone in the Oasis room, Tom?"
30-07-2020T22:00:33,SomethingSelfless,Don't forget that Lynn punched through solid brick/stone because Maddie drank his coffee
30-07-2020T22:00:38,Mediawatcher,I find it funny how Karen made a tease towards sythe and maren in the current page
30-07-2020T22:00:42,hyneria,huh I just realized the owner of the red text boxes was in that page too
30-07-2020T22:00:42,CrRAR,wut
30-07-2020T22:00:48,IronHorseComics,now I can see Lynn preparing to take on Clovis' goons
30-07-2020T22:00:49,Nekonny,"Since todays the last day of the month, I should look into setting up the character fvote for next month ^^"
30-07-2020T22:00:49,CrRAR,Wasn't that Landen/Maddie?
30-07-2020T22:00:51,Ordithus,"um that was Landen, something"
30-07-2020T22:00:52,SomethingSelfless,He'd have no problem getting out of the oaisis room
30-07-2020T22:00:59,SomethingSelfless,YOU GET MY POINT
30-07-2020T22:01:07,Mediawatcher,We still don’t know where sythe is
30-07-2020T22:01:09,SomethingSelfless,I forget names far too easily
30-07-2020T22:01:09,Mihari,"Man, I didn't realize Ruby was that voluptuous."
30-07-2020T22:01:11,CrRAR,Lynn knocked out some folks with his ears once
30-07-2020T22:01:16,SomethingSelfless,Yes we do
30-07-2020T22:01:17,CrRAR,he's capable
30-07-2020T22:01:20,Ordithus,"Kat and Maddie, yeah"
30-07-2020T22:01:21,CrRAR,of defense
30-07-2020T22:01:29,SomethingSelfless,Sythe is still in that room that he and Maren were in probably
30-07-2020T22:01:41,CrRAR,*brandishes ears like nunchucks*
30-07-2020T22:01:43,Roughlandin,No Sythe got bamfed too with Maren
30-07-2020T22:01:44,Mediawatcher,Or he is currently out looking for the other
30-07-2020T22:01:45,SomethingSelfless,Pft
30-07-2020T22:01:47,Mediawatcher,Others
30-07-2020T22:01:50,PurpleLemons,:eyes:
30-07-2020T22:01:50,Mediawatcher,and maren
30-07-2020T22:01:55,Ordithus,o/ purp
30-07-2020T22:01:58,SomethingSelfless,Maren got icced
30-07-2020T22:02:02,Mediawatcher,Hey purple
30-07-2020T22:02:03,KeefMcDerpface,hello Purple
30-07-2020T22:02:08,Roughlandin,Sythe and Maren both got warped
30-07-2020T22:02:15,CrimsonHelsing,It only makes sense Sythe would be trying to get help
30-07-2020T22:02:18,CrRAR,hehheh
30-07-2020T22:02:19,CrRAR,Maren got stone'd
30-07-2020T22:02:27,CrRAR,hehhehhehhehe
30-07-2020T22:02:28,SomethingSelfless,She got icced. Dummy.
30-07-2020T22:02:36,CrRAR,*Bevis and Buthead laughter*
30-07-2020T22:02:43,Roughlandin,Woah. Tossing around the D word. Ouch.
30-07-2020T22:02:43,hyneria,Hopefully soon we can put an end to all the Rose/Dark Trace speculation
30-07-2020T22:03:00,hyneria,Unless I am a derp and there has always been two dark/shadow Traces
30-07-2020T22:03:07,SomethingSelfless,-surreal meme 4.5th dimensional laughtrack-
30-07-2020T22:03:11,CrRAR,they like oompa loompas
30-07-2020T22:03:13,CrRAR,duh
30-07-2020T22:03:17,CrRAR,they everywhere
30-07-2020T22:03:19,Roughlandin,I'm still team Rose Isn't Evil
30-07-2020T22:03:21,SomethingSelfless,Who are?
30-07-2020T22:03:22,CrRAR,Wait for the boat ride
30-07-2020T22:03:31,CrimsonHelsing,Same Rough
30-07-2020T22:03:31,CrRAR,shit gets freaky
30-07-2020T22:03:33,Ordithus,":ctwokinds-rose: just a little evil, she's still cute"
30-07-2020T22:03:38,SomethingSelfless,Nah
30-07-2020T22:03:45,hyneria,Everything points to Rose being evil
30-07-2020T22:03:49,Roughlandin,Eh
30-07-2020T22:03:55,SomethingSelfless,See that's where I like to parade my THEORY
30-07-2020T22:04:02,PopularDollars,young rose >>> current rose
30-07-2020T22:04:06,IronHorseComics,... :cironhorsecomics-Facepalm:
30-07-2020T22:04:07,Dragusthor,I do not believe
30-07-2020T22:04:09,Roughlandin,What has Rose actually done?
30-07-2020T22:04:19,SomethingSelfless,Still not gonna spill my theory because that'd be rude
30-07-2020T22:04:20,CrRAR,Could want to escape
30-07-2020T22:04:22,hyneria,Tried to kill everyone? :P
30-07-2020T22:04:24,CrRAR,who knows
30-07-2020T22:04:25,IronHorseComics,well she SAVED Maddie and Karen
30-07-2020T22:04:27,CrimsonHelsing,"Not really, it's still very inconclusive. But I have reason to believe the estate is*not* acting on her command at the moment"
30-07-2020T22:04:29,IronHorseComics,for starters
30-07-2020T22:04:30,CrRAR,yeah
30-07-2020T22:04:33,SomethingSelfless,Who knows indeed
30-07-2020T22:04:44,PopularDollars,she has red glowey eyes. that must mean she's evil!
30-07-2020T22:04:46,CrRAR,"She does seem to want to ""arrange"" traces demise"
30-07-2020T22:04:56,Mediawatcher,It still looks like rose is evil
30-07-2020T22:04:57,hyneria,"Either way, I'm sad for rose. She really has no way out here"
30-07-2020T22:04:59,SomethingSelfless,Just think about how euchre talked with 'rose'
30-07-2020T22:05:02,johnnytho,If anything Rose would only be mad at Trace. So I dont think the stone lizards are her doing
30-07-2020T22:05:03,CrimsonHelsing,She may have grabbed Trace in the nick of time before the lockdown because she knew only he can abort the lockdown
30-07-2020T22:05:07,hyneria,She is something that shouldn't exist
30-07-2020T22:05:07,Roughlandin,She specifically said she thought about killing Trace and decided not to
30-07-2020T22:05:12,CrRAR,":ctwokinds-sadtrace2:*[uhhh, my schedules already pretty booked]"
30-07-2020T22:05:14,steelabjur,"I'm of two minds, and I think Rose is too."
30-07-2020T22:05:17,NezumiYuki,"Rose has red eyes, red hair, red aura...   She's evul~"
30-07-2020T22:05:22,PopularDollars,is maddie standing inside the pool?
30-07-2020T22:05:24,CrRAR,":ctwokinds-rose:*[ok, I'll WAIT]"
30-07-2020T22:05:26,Ordithus,green eyes
30-07-2020T22:05:31,SomethingSelfless,↑
30-07-2020T22:05:42,SomethingSelfless,She do have green eyes
30-07-2020T22:05:45,CrRAR,splish splash
30-07-2020T22:05:48,Mediawatcher,"Regardless I can’t help but sympathize with rose, she’s went through so much in her life and traced used her after Sarai’s death"
30-07-2020T22:05:48,NezumiYuki,okay most of the time green eyes but.....
30-07-2020T22:05:50,Roughlandin,She also already knew Maren was in the Manor. All these evil stuff only started happening when Maren touched the table. Then Red Text showed up.
30-07-2020T22:05:52,hyneria,So hopefully by the end of this arc Rose can finally die and rest in peace
30-07-2020T22:05:54,Mediawatcher,Sarias’s
30-07-2020T22:06:05,hyneria,no Roughlanding
30-07-2020T22:06:12,Mediawatcher,Rose needs freedom from all this
30-07-2020T22:06:12,SomethingSelfless,;-; now ahm sad
30-07-2020T22:06:14,hyneria,The red text was around before
30-07-2020T22:06:16,Dragusthor,it's like releasing something you don't know what it is but it turns out to be evil
30-07-2020T22:06:22,PopularDollars,you know who else has red hair?
30-07-2020T22:06:24,SomethingSelfless,The red text is demonic trace
30-07-2020T22:06:29,CrRAR,uhhh
30-07-2020T22:06:30,hyneria,What
30-07-2020T22:06:33,hyneria,how?
30-07-2020T22:06:40,NezumiYuki,LOL Red has red hair... right?
30-07-2020T22:06:40,CrRAR,That red haired guy?
30-07-2020T22:06:45,hyneria,Evil Trace is always creepy white font
30-07-2020T22:06:49,CrRAR,Rudebaker?
30-07-2020T22:06:51,unsteddyphoenix,Blessed maddie
30-07-2020T22:06:56,IronHorseComics,"you realize when Rose was talking to Trace about his ""experiment"" on her was green, right?"
30-07-2020T22:06:56,hyneria,and dark trace is inside of Trace's head
30-07-2020T22:06:58,Ordithus,hi teddy
30-07-2020T22:07:02,hyneria,not going around on its own

30-07-2020T22:07:25,KeefMcDerpface,hello teddy
30-07-2020T22:07:32,hyneria,I think the human with red hair and all the vines and tentacles
30-07-2020T22:07:36,SomethingSelfless,"Look at the recent page, look at the shadow behind trace, then at the text smoke cloud, its tail leads towards the shadow trace behind real trace"
30-07-2020T22:07:38,hyneria,is a human version of Rose
30-07-2020T22:07:46,Mediawatcher,Wonder what color Karen’s swimsuit is gonna be this page
30-07-2020T22:07:55,IronHorseComics,"blue, naturally"
30-07-2020T22:07:58,hyneria,"Something, you realize that the shadow you speak of is a physical being?"
30-07-2020T22:08:00,Dragusthor,hello teddy
30-07-2020T22:08:01,SomethingSelfless,"hyneria, what are you on about?"
30-07-2020T22:08:01,hyneria,Maddie saw it
30-07-2020T22:08:10,SomethingSelfless,That's literally just rose
30-07-2020T22:08:14,hyneria,Dark Trace is only in Trace's mind
30-07-2020T22:08:18,hyneria,no
30-07-2020T22:08:25,SomethingSelfless,Not necessarily in the estate
30-07-2020T22:08:43,Nekonny,"Ok, voting is up ^^"

30-07-2020T22:09:02,hyneria,this thing with the cape and the red hair
30-07-2020T22:09:04,SomethingSelfless,"Plus he still has a separate character bio in the ""characters"" tab as a villain"
30-07-2020T22:09:10,hyneria,is the red text boxes
30-07-2020T22:09:16,hyneria,and it is not Dark Trace
30-07-2020T22:09:30,Ordithus,sure has Trace's hair and build

30-07-2020T22:09:58,hyneria,was locked in the garden
30-07-2020T22:09:59,SomethingSelfless,It's literally trace
30-07-2020T22:10:04,johnnytho,Hot Topic Trace
30-07-2020T22:10:05,SomethingSelfless,No that was rose
30-07-2020T22:10:10,Dragusthor,Is there another trace physically or is it dark magic?
30-07-2020T22:10:23,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rose: such wild speculation
30-07-2020T22:10:23,johnnytho,I think its magic

30-07-2020T23:25:06,SageSaga,if anything was out of place they would fix or adjust it before moving in on their victim
30-07-2020T23:25:27,Roughlandin,Ha! Then I'm safe. My room is a disaster area!
30-07-2020T23:25:28,SageSaga,its why they usually went after wealthy people who had maids and everything to keep everything clean and proper

30-07-2020T23:26:51,AspiringNoodle,"Sage, you ever see that movie where the Vampire completely dismantles all those ""tricks"" meant to keep them at bay?"
30-07-2020T23:27:03,NezumiYuki,"Fairly well here, how 'bout yourself, Dadro?"
30-07-2020T23:27:18,BadFoMo,"@NezumiYuki That would have made her happy, and her sister angry."

30-07-2020T23:27:49,SageSaga,"I remember one where the vampire laughed at the cross and said ""IM JEWISH!"""
30-07-2020T23:27:57,NezumiYuki,Well then don't be a mature adult....  be an immature one!
30-07-2020T23:27:57,AspiringNoodle,And the vampire counts the grains in real time as they're flying through the air
30-07-2020T23:28:09,SageSaga,and then the person used a Star of David and it hissed and ran away
30-07-2020T23:28:14,AspiringNoodle,And then cheekily increments the count by 1 when another grain falls out of the bag while the guy stares on in disbelief

30-07-2020T23:28:21,Dadrobit,Accidentally scarred my nieces and nephews just before I headed to work. And couldn't help but giggle at them.

30-07-2020T23:29:06,Dadrobit,And they found it hilarious to watch him chase a squirrel.
30-07-2020T23:29:13,Dadrobit,Until he caught it
30-07-2020T23:29:14,Roughlandin,Oh no

30-07-2020T23:29:42,Roughlandin,This squirrel was decidedly less immortal than Nibbs
30-07-2020T23:29:43,Dadrobit,Aaaaaaand I mighta laughed a bit at them.

30-07-2020T23:33:03,Roughlandin,I had a similar situation in my backyard. But with a baby bird instead of a squirrel
30-07-2020T23:33:41,KeefMcDerpface,Same here but with gophers and my cat.
30-07-2020T23:33:46,NezumiYuki,"So Tom, what we're saying is that Nibbs is partly inspired by them illusive Tree Rat visitors you've had?   xDD   CUTE!"
30-07-2020T23:33:48,Dadrobit,My boy was totally feral on the street before I got him. So he had to get good at this stuff early as a puppy
30-07-2020T23:34:13,Roughlandin,Birds had a nest in a hanging planter. Kids watched the baby go from an egg to almost ready to fly. It fell out onto the deck and was a snack within the hour...

30-07-2020T23:34:42,Twokinds,"Well we have squirrel feeders, so I'll usually wake up in the morning and see around 10 or so in the yard."
30-07-2020T23:34:49,SageSaga,had a squirrel fall out of a tree while he was like 90 to 100 feet up- hit the deck. My cat went up to it and licked his head till he got up and walked away
