01-05-2020T00:12:52,Dadrobit,Indeed. I'm half a year short.

01-05-2020T00:19:36,BluePhantom90,I mean you do a good job at Belly Dance outfits Lemons
01-05-2020T00:25:36,SpazztasticKiwi,oh the Tom is sick

01-05-2020T00:25:54,SpazztasticKiwi,well that’s unfortunate
01-05-2020T00:26:08,Twokinds,I'm not sick!
01-05-2020T00:26:25,SpazztasticKiwi,why’s everyone wishing you better then
01-05-2020T00:26:26,BadFoMo,You arn't?
01-05-2020T00:26:30,Ordithus,in what way
01-05-2020T00:26:31,KeefMcDerpface,?
01-05-2020T00:26:53,Twokinds,I'm just not feelin the best. Tired.
01-05-2020T00:27:03,BadFoMo,Oh...
01-05-2020T00:27:09,PurpleLemons,gota get some good rest Tom
01-05-2020T00:27:11,KeefMcDerpface,oh okay.
01-05-2020T00:27:12,Ordithus,I get that
01-05-2020T00:27:15,Twokinds,Sometimes you're just not 100%. Right? It's not just me?
01-05-2020T00:27:16,SpazztasticKiwi,yea that’s understandable - got lots to do as always
01-05-2020T00:27:31,Ordithus,I am very familiar
01-05-2020T00:27:40,PurpleLemons,I feel ya Tom
01-05-2020T00:27:43,ZRO4825,"If by ""sometimes"" you mean ""damned near every day anymore"", then yes, it's not just you."
01-05-2020T00:28:04,SpazztasticKiwi,the stay at home and have nothing but seeing it and work while only being able to occupy yourself with work and home?
01-05-2020T00:28:19,ZRO4825,That's all I do even when there's not a pandemic. That's nothing new. =D
01-05-2020T00:28:54,SageSaga,I havent been 100% in YEARS
01-05-2020T00:28:56,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s got to the point that introverts are getting cabin fever
01-05-2020T00:29:17,SpazztasticKiwi,granted it’s partially because they’re stuck with family
01-05-2020T00:29:22,ZRO4825,"Amen, Sage, lol"
01-05-2020T00:30:29,SpazztasticKiwi,fun fact (supposedly) - the age you’re considered to be dying is around 22/23 because this is when cells stop being able to 1:1 replenish
01-05-2020T00:30:29,ZRO4825,"Purp, you playin the good music <3"
01-05-2020T00:30:45,johnnytho,ima start dying soon
01-05-2020T00:30:53,johnnytho,yay
01-05-2020T00:31:08,SageSaga,"like thats not even a joke- when health diminishes and the doctors say ""There's only ways to help make you feel slightly more normal"" you know 100% is no longer obtainable"
01-05-2020T00:31:31,SpazztasticKiwi,have you tried changing the battery
01-05-2020T00:31:39,SpazztasticKiwi,bad timing I know
01-05-2020T00:32:26,SageSaga,"""Have you tried turning it on and off again?"" ""Have i killed myself and come back to life?"" ""hmmmmmmmm"""
01-05-2020T00:33:05,Ordithus,have you tried swapping out for the new model?
01-05-2020T00:33:13,SpazztasticKiwi,would you consider sleep to be a type of reset
01-05-2020T00:33:20,SageSaga,no
01-05-2020T00:33:27,SageSaga,because the power is not totally off
01-05-2020T00:33:40,SpazztasticKiwi,how about a restart
01-05-2020T00:33:44,SageSaga,it's literally sleep mode
01-05-2020T00:34:03,SpazztasticKiwi,“device is idol. do not disturb”
01-05-2020T00:34:27,SageSaga,is that a joke about like hatsuna miku?
01-05-2020T00:34:34,SageSaga,or did you actually mean idle?
01-05-2020T00:34:35,SpazztasticKiwi,who
01-05-2020T00:35:02,SageSaga,that answers that unless i spelled Miku's name wrong
01-05-2020T00:35:22,Kynum,e
01-05-2020T00:35:27,SpazztasticKiwi,why does that make me think you’re referrncing some kpop
01-05-2020T00:35:42,SageSaga,because you think kpop is jpop!
01-05-2020T00:36:07,johnnytho,miki is a hologram singer thing
01-05-2020T00:36:09,ZRO4825,Hatsune Miku. But close enough. :P
01-05-2020T00:36:13,johnnytho,miku**
01-05-2020T00:36:24,SageSaga,sune not suna- ok
01-05-2020T00:36:37,SpazztasticKiwi,you’ve very much lost me so yep
01-05-2020T00:36:49,chlomqe,where am i
01-05-2020T00:36:58,chlomqe,how did I get here
01-05-2020T00:37:04,chlomqe,beautiful art tho
01-05-2020T00:37:17,johnnytho,you typed in picartotv
01-05-2020T00:37:31,KeefMcDerpface,Did Nibbs Nab another person?
01-05-2020T00:37:51,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe that’s why Tom came up with nibbs
01-05-2020T00:37:57,Ordithus,"you have found sage and purp, bringers of lovely art"
01-05-2020T00:38:05,SpazztasticKiwi,to drag-I mean lure in new fans
01-05-2020T00:39:14,johnnytho,Nibbs has been charged with felony kidnapping. Sentenced to life in federal prison.
01-05-2020T00:39:38,johnnytho,...Nibbs has escaped
01-05-2020T00:39:57,KeefMcDerpface,"She chewed through the bars, didn't she?"
01-05-2020T00:40:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"no, the guards just don’t care to do paperwork and cuff a squirrel"
01-05-2020T00:40:38,SpazztasticKiwi,so Sage....
01-05-2020T00:40:46,SpazztasticKiwi,how’s it going with delta
01-05-2020T00:40:48,SageSaga,"oh Tomorrow is Ascendance of a bookworm day- also My Life as a Villainess, all routes lead to doom!"
01-05-2020T00:41:05,SageSaga,Delta has decided i am not worthy of my money
01-05-2020T00:41:22,SpazztasticKiwi,can I laugh
01-05-2020T00:41:25,Ordithus,dang
01-05-2020T00:41:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel like I shouldn’t but
01-05-2020T00:41:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I got about the same response
01-05-2020T00:42:03,SageSaga,they are basically saying that since there is no lock down set to continue into July that my flight will not be refunded
01-05-2020T00:42:30,KeefMcDerpface,Now what?
01-05-2020T00:42:31,SpazztasticKiwi,but I’ll cash it in for credit later - after all this you bet I’m finding something in the future to do
01-05-2020T00:42:40,ZRO4825,"....seriously, Sage?"
01-05-2020T00:43:03,SageSaga,they did however give me the full amount back as credit to be used on a flight in the next 2 years (normally only 1 year)
01-05-2020T00:43:16,Ordithus,could be worse
01-05-2020T00:43:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"did they not tell you that if the flight gets canceled or the times changed with a 90 minute difference either way, they’ll have to refund you"
01-05-2020T00:43:22,SageSaga,so im just going to use it for next year and get a first class ticket
01-05-2020T00:43:47,ZRO4825,That's still bullshit. I heard from someone else that they were having trouble getting the Hilton to refund their money for their room for AC.
01-05-2020T00:43:54,SageSaga,the flight was not cancelled- the event i was going to was
01-05-2020T00:44:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"and that because of shut downs, that’s exactly what’s happening to flights as they get close to date"
01-05-2020T00:44:37,SageSaga,if the flight gets cancelled in July though they should be required to refund me but they probably wont
01-05-2020T00:45:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"I mean that because of shut downs and new restrictions, like aisles’ seating being blocked, times for tickets and availability is getting changed involuntarily on the clients parts"
01-05-2020T00:45:44,SpazztasticKiwi,and delta is required to refund the tickets when this happens
01-05-2020T00:46:23,SpazztasticKiwi,as far as my agent I contacted  has assured
01-05-2020T00:46:25,SageSaga,i'll keep trying but i dont really have a voice in this
01-05-2020T00:47:00,SageSaga,like- unless i can find something concrete to throw at them
01-05-2020T00:47:21,SageSaga,i still gotta look into my travel insurance
01-05-2020T00:47:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"like I said, aisle seating is being closed to ticket buying altogether so if they assigned you an aisle seat, you must have been swapped"
01-05-2020T00:48:25,SageSaga,i was first class in my own aisle with no other seats next to me
01-05-2020T00:48:32,SpazztasticKiwi,however that could be select flights at the moment with some states reopening while others aren’t or an independent thing for delta
01-05-2020T00:48:54,SageSaga,and again- for Delta
01-05-2020T00:48:59,SageSaga,in July
01-05-2020T00:49:12,SpazztasticKiwi,first class with those smushy plush seats that sit waaaaay back like a recliner?
01-05-2020T00:49:25,SageSaga,yes
01-05-2020T00:49:33,SpazztasticKiwi,beautiful
01-05-2020T00:49:42,SageSaga,and now i dont get to go T_T
01-05-2020T00:49:46,SpazztasticKiwi,excellent choice
01-05-2020T00:50:02,unsteddyphoenix,Daaamn howd you get first class!?
01-05-2020T00:50:04,unsteddyphoenix,Very nice
01-05-2020T00:50:17,SageSaga,its easy- you pay money for it
01-05-2020T00:50:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"I know, whether it’s a refund or credit for me, I’ve been looking at PAX next year"
01-05-2020T00:50:31,SageSaga,money that they are now not going to give me back
01-05-2020T00:50:31,unsteddyphoenix,Damn sage livin' large
01-05-2020T00:50:46,unsteddyphoenix,Ive only been on business class 'cause the airlines bumped me up
01-05-2020T00:51:02,ZRO4825,I'm just disappointed cuz I was gonna try really hard to get myself up to AC this year. Had made up my mind and all...and now shit be canceled. Fuck Covid. >:(
01-05-2020T00:51:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"vacations already paid off, so gotta throw it at something"
01-05-2020T00:51:11,SpazztasticKiwi,same
01-05-2020T00:51:49,Ordithus,yeah my annual trip to AZ isn't happening
01-05-2020T00:52:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"looking shortly after, my general ticket for anthro would get me enough credit for two first class tickets to PAX with how prices are"
01-05-2020T00:52:12,SageSaga,im going to be extremely upset if i cant get a first class ticket again for the same price next year though
01-05-2020T00:52:49,SpazztasticKiwi,it’ll be interesting is lots of places rack up prices for profits because of the loss this year
01-05-2020T00:52:52,SpazztasticKiwi,if
01-05-2020T00:53:15,SageSaga,the bailouts are suposed to be put in place to prevent that
01-05-2020T00:53:26,w0lfmare,Might be cheaper next year
01-05-2020T00:53:32,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s been people arrested for it already tho
01-05-2020T00:53:45,SageSaga,arrested for what?
01-05-2020T00:53:51,w0lfmare,Disasters usually lower the prices for flights and cruises
01-05-2020T00:54:01,SpazztasticKiwi,monster costs for essentials
01-05-2020T00:54:12,SageSaga,thats not the same as this
01-05-2020T00:54:24,SageSaga,that's price gouging and it's illegal
01-05-2020T00:55:24,ZRO4825,Price Gouging - When being a normal shithead just wasn't enough and you gotta go Super Saiyan on that shit.
01-05-2020T00:55:25,SageSaga,amazon was kicking people off their marketplace for price gouging to avoid being at partial fault
01-05-2020T00:55:43,SpazztasticKiwi,“nope I’m not about to get sued”
01-05-2020T00:56:13,SageSaga,because both the market and the seller get in trouble for that- and Amazon has the money so they are like 100% likely to get hit if they dont show they made an effort
01-05-2020T00:56:16,SpazztasticKiwi,like the guy stuck with a garage full of hand sanitizer cause he’s been barred from selling it?
01-05-2020T00:56:35,Ordithus,I suppose he could donate it
01-05-2020T00:56:46,SpazztasticKiwi,he was forced to really
01-05-2020T00:56:53,SageSaga,yep he was
01-05-2020T00:57:01,Ordithus,what a hero
01-05-2020T00:57:14,SageSaga,he would have been-
01-05-2020T00:57:23,SageSaga,if he had kept his mouth shut but he didnt!
01-05-2020T00:57:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I can say I can be petty but is it really petty that it put a smile on my face
01-05-2020T00:57:52,SageSaga,"like if he had said ""I thought i was taking advantage of a marketing opportunity- i didnt realize it was this bad- so im donating it all"""
01-05-2020T00:58:07,SageSaga,instead he ... well he didnt do that - he said much stupider things XD
01-05-2020T00:58:15,KeefMcDerpface,Night all. :ptv-sleepy:
01-05-2020T00:58:20,ZRO4825,"If that's being petty, Kiwi, then I am too. Because I LOVE watching Karma kick people like that in the balls."
01-05-2020T00:58:22,Ordithus,night keef
01-05-2020T00:58:23,SpazztasticKiwi,in one interview he’s asked if he’s sorry/regrets it
01-05-2020T00:58:28,SpazztasticKiwi,“.....no”
01-05-2020T00:58:30,ZRO4825,G'night Keef.
01-05-2020T00:58:52,FoxxTrotter,"I'm off to bed. G'night, everyone. :0)"
01-05-2020T00:58:59,Ordithus,night foxx
01-05-2020T00:59:00,ZRO4825,G'night Foxx!
01-05-2020T00:59:27,SageSaga,Kiwi- yeah it was that long pause that really screwed him more than the no XD
01-05-2020T01:00:05,SageSaga,"its like ""you spent enough time thinking about this to know your answer is going to have some kind of effect on how people see you- and you went for it anyways!"""
01-05-2020T01:00:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"now the general populace detests you, are you proud"
01-05-2020T01:00:22,Ordithus,when this whole thing started there were a couple people trying to sell tp for $5 a roll... we never had shortages here
01-05-2020T01:00:53,SageSaga,we just got Toilet paper back for the first time in 8 weeks
01-05-2020T01:00:58,SageSaga,its all gone again though
01-05-2020T01:00:58,Ordithus,\o/
01-05-2020T01:01:01,Ordithus,no
01-05-2020T01:01:08,unsteddyphoenix,What seriously?
01-05-2020T01:01:11,SageSaga,seriously
01-05-2020T01:01:15,SpazztasticKiwi,dude our store was so bad until the craze went from roiling boil to tiny boil
01-05-2020T01:01:18,unsteddyphoenix,What the hell
01-05-2020T01:01:24,unsteddyphoenix,What...did the people without do?
01-05-2020T01:01:27,SageSaga,i got one package though
01-05-2020T01:01:39,Dadrobit,Take a shower
01-05-2020T01:01:42,Ordithus,at some point people are gonna have enough for years of taco bell
01-05-2020T01:01:43,SageSaga,bidet sales are going well
01-05-2020T01:01:45,unsteddyphoenix,D:
01-05-2020T01:01:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"every morning we got a shipment in and stocked the aisle, people would come in just to sweep it off again"
01-05-2020T01:02:18,SpazztasticKiwi,it got to the point where they just wheeled out the pallets and didn’t bother
01-05-2020T01:02:36,Dadrobit,"I just happened to have restocked just before the TP craze happened, so I was able to stay outta that mess."
01-05-2020T01:02:39,ZRO4825,Our area put limits on items like that.
01-05-2020T01:02:44,Ordithus,^
01-05-2020T01:02:48,Dadrobit,Otherwise I just got another box off of Amazon.
01-05-2020T01:02:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I missed the part in the symptoms where it says you’ll shit your britches
01-05-2020T01:03:12,SageSaga,Robit- i needed to restock when this all started- i was TOO LATE
01-05-2020T01:03:15,ZRO4825,"Ya know, that's the funniest part of it....the TP craze didn't even make a damned lick of sense."
01-05-2020T01:03:24,SageSaga,i ended up buying some off amazon- huge rip off
01-05-2020T01:03:49,Ordithus,needed armed guards
01-05-2020T01:04:00,unsteddyphoenix,God. I wonder how much the people reselling tp actually made
01-05-2020T01:04:02,Ordithus,you paid for the security
01-05-2020T01:04:04,Dadrobit,"Also, my local Wal Mart just had folks line up and do a limit one. They never brought the TP out, the people just had to wait in front of the back storeroom doors while an employee fetched a pack for them."
01-05-2020T01:04:07,unsteddyphoenix,Did someone actually get rich off it...
01-05-2020T01:04:45,SageSaga,oh i didnt tell yall about my dream from a few weeks ago did I?
01-05-2020T01:04:55,Ordithus,what are dreams
01-05-2020T01:05:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"now - milk, tp, paper towels, wipes of all kinds, some baby supplies, eggs, some dry and canned goods, & even pasta is limit 1 item"
01-05-2020T01:05:17,SageSaga,they are these experiences you have while sleeping even if you dont remember them
01-05-2020T01:05:30,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
01-05-2020T01:05:48,Ordithus,sounds interesting
01-05-2020T01:06:04,SpazztasticKiwi,we still get “can you look in the back” “do you have more in the back” like we didn’t just say we’re completely out
01-05-2020T01:06:40,Dadrobit,"I really really really can't see anyone getting ""rich"" off of flipping toilet paper... They were just assholes who made a month or two of extra gas money in the end."
01-05-2020T01:06:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"any of them ask me to check, I walk back there and look at the wall for a couple minutes or maybe ask a stockman “we’re out of this right?”"
01-05-2020T01:06:54,johnnytho,I went to the store an nearly had a panic attack. Its scary seeing empty shelves
01-05-2020T01:06:59,SageSaga,"so i had 2 dreams i can recall very clearly, one involved a secret scientific facility researching aliens- and when i say aliens i mean- Alien/Aliens/Aliens 2 etc Aliens. The other dream involved teaming up with Catwoman to help Batman who had"
01-05-2020T01:07:08,unsteddyphoenix,Lol thats exactly what I did when I worked retail Spazz
01-05-2020T01:07:10,Dadrobit,Xenomorphs
01-05-2020T01:07:11,SageSaga,spliced with an assassin bug and was now eating criminals
01-05-2020T01:07:21,unsteddyphoenix,You cant go back too quick or they think you didnt look properly
01-05-2020T01:07:25,SageSaga,had been* spliced
01-05-2020T01:07:27,johnnytho,0_)
01-05-2020T01:07:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Sage how much acid did you take
01-05-2020T01:07:28,AspiringNoodle,I had a dream I want to illustrate one of these days
01-05-2020T01:07:41,SageSaga,i consume no illicit substances
01-05-2020T01:07:45,unsteddyphoenix,I feel like thats a real DC comic
01-05-2020T01:07:51,Ordithus,when did you watch aliens
01-05-2020T01:07:51,SpazztasticKiwi,“no illicit”
01-05-2020T01:07:54,Ordithus,and probably is
01-05-2020T01:07:56,AspiringNoodle,Bottomless and endless lake in the middle of a park
01-05-2020T01:07:58,unsteddyphoenix,"""cannibat"""
01-05-2020T01:08:12,SageSaga,i have not watch Alien or Aliens in about a year
01-05-2020T01:08:22,AspiringNoodle,"bioluminescent jellyfish, purple and gold koi fish, deep fog, Japanese-inspired bridges and platforms and weeping willows everywhere"
01-05-2020T01:08:30,SpazztasticKiwi,your subconscious might be trying to tell you something
01-05-2020T01:08:30,AspiringNoodle,Let's just say that dream was an *experience* :ptv-laugh:
01-05-2020T01:08:33,SageSaga,i have a friend that is a big fan of the movies though that talks about it often
01-05-2020T01:08:33,Ordithus,"pretty, noodle"
01-05-2020T01:08:55,AspiringNoodle,"When I say endless and bottomless, I mean it, lol"
01-05-2020T01:09:03,Dadrobit,Actually just watched Alien again a week or two ago.
01-05-2020T01:09:04,Ordithus,"terrifying, noodle"
01-05-2020T01:09:12,Dadrobit,Still incredibly solid
01-05-2020T01:09:13,AspiringNoodle,"Neatly trimmed park grass leads into this lake, shores start shallow, and just keep going"
01-05-2020T01:09:19,SageSaga,did yall wanna hear about either of those?
01-05-2020T01:09:28,AspiringNoodle,Then you got these bridges and platforms spreading out into the watered area
01-05-2020T01:09:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I get dreams that are good ideas for horror creatures
01-05-2020T01:09:45,AspiringNoodle,And they go so far that the fog eventually blocks your sight
01-05-2020T01:09:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I write out some
01-05-2020T01:09:58,AspiringNoodle,"It's like, dare you venture out?"
01-05-2020T01:10:04,Ordithus,gonna head to bed myself.  maybe I'll have dreams
01-05-2020T01:10:08,SageSaga,i keep a dream journal
01-05-2020T01:10:11,AspiringNoodle,"It's really pretty, for sure, but you don't know if there's another side ;)"
01-05-2020T01:10:17,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz: nighty night

01-05-2020T01:10:29,AspiringNoodle,"That dream was my brain telling me I forgot a pyschology assignment, haha"
01-05-2020T01:10:34,Dadrobit,"Oh, I read the second dream wrong the first time, I thought you said that she ""teamed up with"" Batman instead of helping him."
01-05-2020T01:10:34,AspiringNoodle,Sweet ZZZ's Ord
01-05-2020T01:10:34,Ordithus,Also nice work you two!

01-05-2020T01:11:03,AspiringNoodle,"UGH, no wonder Purp didn't look like any work was getting done"
01-05-2020T01:11:11,AspiringNoodle,The stream never started :ptv-whiny:
01-05-2020T01:11:26,SageSaga,o_O
01-05-2020T01:11:40,SageSaga,it started so long ago-
01-05-2020T01:11:44,AspiringNoodle,I thought I hit play on all the streams :c
01-05-2020T01:12:00,unsteddyphoenix,Its...been like 6 hours my guy lmao
01-05-2020T01:12:07,SpazztasticKiwi,you got any good boogeymans to share
01-05-2020T01:12:21,johnnytho,purple has been streaming for 10 HOURS what
01-05-2020T01:12:26,SageSaga,ok so no one wants to hear crazy dreams
01-05-2020T01:12:35,johnnytho,i do
01-05-2020T01:12:40,PurpleLemons,it only feels like 2 lol
01-05-2020T01:12:41,SpazztasticKiwi,boi I just asked
01-05-2020T01:12:52,PurpleLemons,i'm pretty slow today lol
01-05-2020T01:13:07,SageSaga,which one?
01-05-2020T01:13:16,SageSaga,aliens or Batman/Catwoman? or both? XD
01-05-2020T01:13:27,SageSaga,the aliens one was super longish
01-05-2020T01:13:32,SpazztasticKiwi,hit me with your best shot
01-05-2020T01:13:41,johnnytho,aliens
01-05-2020T01:13:51,johnnytho,im in a spooky mood
01-05-2020T01:14:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"also, a small poll: if you were to be simply out walking with friends in a nature trail on a temperate day and you came across sort of near the end before going back where there’s a bridge over a sort of nothing stream..."
01-05-2020T01:14:21,SageSaga,"the xenos were in a facility that was underground and massive, i was there as like part of a government safety inspection team"
01-05-2020T01:14:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"and on the other side is snow, would you cross"
01-05-2020T01:14:57,johnnytho,no
01-05-2020T01:15:17,Dadrobit,Yes. Snow is my jam. It's like seeing a unicorn here in central AZ
01-05-2020T01:15:21,SageSaga,"we got to one of the containment rooms and our guide was like ""As you can see it's very secure with over 6 layers of security between doors-"""
01-05-2020T01:15:49,SageSaga,"and as he was talking there was one right outside the door- and we were like ""Wait- how many layers? That looks like one-"""
01-05-2020T01:16:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"you’d cross, noting that it’s a temperate day yet there’s snow..."
01-05-2020T01:16:32,SageSaga,"and he was like ""OH NO!"" and slaps a big red button and the whole place goes into lockdown as the alien gets crushed against the door by another alien-"
01-05-2020T01:16:36,SpazztasticKiwi,what kind of security between doors? electric fencing?
01-05-2020T01:16:46,SageSaga,the acid starts spilling out through the door and we're running further in
01-05-2020T01:17:21,SageSaga,we ran down the escalator and we see through this thick glass all these xenos dropping out from the bottom of the lab onto people working and killing them
01-05-2020T01:17:23,johnnytho,acid from the alien?
01-05-2020T01:17:25,Dadrobit,"I mean, we had snow in July a few years back. Climate is weird as fuck."
01-05-2020T01:17:36,SageSaga,yes Xenos have acid blood
01-05-2020T01:17:49,SpazztasticKiwi,transfusions must be hell
01-05-2020T01:18:32,SageSaga,we hit the button for the elevator and when it opens a tail shoots out from the door and kills our guide
01-05-2020T01:19:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"“the tour has ended, please exit through our lovely new gift shop”"
01-05-2020T01:19:12,SageSaga,we run to the stairs to go further down and we end up in these red corridors with door after door with lab numbers on them
01-05-2020T01:19:39,SageSaga,we end up splitting up looking for a way out- i hear several people get ambushed down other halls screaming
01-05-2020T01:20:00,SageSaga,i see a shadow coming my way so i duck into one of the labs
01-05-2020T01:20:50,SageSaga,"in the lab theres a little girl with really long blood red hair with a metal tag on a necklace around her neck that says ""Subject 4892"""
01-05-2020T01:21:25,SpazztasticKiwi,little children and horror don’t make a good pair
01-05-2020T01:21:26,SageSaga,the alien passes by and attacks someone else so i grab her hand and together we start running down the hall
01-05-2020T01:22:17,SageSaga,we make it to the emergency escape hatches that are like tubes filled with water- you get in a pod thing and it uses the water pressure to launch you through and out of the facility
01-05-2020T01:22:39,SageSaga,we get in there just before another alien attacks and we are launched out into a forest
01-05-2020T01:23:15,SageSaga,we start running as the facilty explodes and thats when i hear the clicking noise- there's xenos in the freakn trees man!
01-05-2020T01:24:30,SageSaga,two drop down infront of us and then suddenly the little girls hair starts flowing down and around her in a puddle of red liquid- and a massive red tiger looking creature lurches out of the pool and splatters the two xenos in a blink of an eye
01-05-2020T01:25:08,SageSaga,the puddle evaporates as her hair goes back to.. normal? and we are running off again-
01-05-2020T01:26:02,SageSaga,we get to a river where theres a boat and 2 youtubers are trying to make a video about who can drowned the other first- we steal their boat just before a xeno jumps on both of them and we take off
01-05-2020T01:26:13,SpazztasticKiwi,mad you’re dragging this kid along with you still after seeing this
01-05-2020T01:26:21,SpazztasticKiwi,and
01-05-2020T01:26:23,johnnytho,typical youtuber behavior
01-05-2020T01:26:41,SageSaga,thats pretty much how it ended
01-05-2020T01:26:50,SpazztasticKiwi,somebody put lsd in your coffee dude
01-05-2020T01:27:00,SageSaga,i dont drink Coffee
01-05-2020T01:27:09,SpazztasticKiwi,tea
01-05-2020T01:27:14,SageSaga,i dont drink tea
01-05-2020T01:27:15,SpazztasticKiwi,water
01-05-2020T01:27:22,SageSaga,i only drink filtered water
01-05-2020T01:27:31,Dadrobit,Hol up. Two folks just trying to get video of them drowning each other?
01-05-2020T01:27:39,SpazztasticKiwi,alright then there’s a gas leak
01-05-2020T01:27:49,SageSaga,yep - they reminded me of the Logan brothers
01-05-2020T01:27:56,SpazztasticKiwi,accurate
01-05-2020T01:28:05,Dadrobit,I think snuff films are against YouTube's TOS....
01-05-2020T01:28:11,SpazztasticKiwi,wouldn’t doubt it/10
01-05-2020T01:28:24,SageSaga,well he did post a video of them finding a dead body-
01-05-2020T01:28:34,SpazztasticKiwi,^^^
01-05-2020T01:28:54,Dadrobit,Kinda separate from active murder.
01-05-2020T01:29:02,SageSaga,so yeah- that was dream number one! Did yall wanna hear about Batman eating people? XD
01-05-2020T01:29:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"the one who shall not be named of the two (granted, along with the other)"
01-05-2020T01:29:28,SpazztasticKiwi,has done other similar garbage things too
01-05-2020T01:29:51,Dadrobit,"Yeah, displaying the body of a suicide case is horrible. But straight murder is legit exponentially worse lol."
01-05-2020T01:30:08,SpazztasticKiwi,batsy cronching on people curros
01-05-2020T01:30:14,SpazztasticKiwi,churros
01-05-2020T01:30:19,SageSaga,are you saying my dreams have to obey Youtubes TOS?
01-05-2020T01:30:50,SpazztasticKiwi,if you managed to film or animate something like that I’m pretty sure I’d go good as a horror short
01-05-2020T01:30:54,SpazztasticKiwi,it’d
01-05-2020T01:31:13,Dadrobit,"If it isn't, is it really YouTube then?"
01-05-2020T01:31:46,SageSaga,Dream Youtube doesnt care about anything but views apparently
01-05-2020T01:31:49,SpazztasticKiwi,did you notice anything about the two youtubers or were they more generic faces
01-05-2020T01:32:00,SpazztasticKiwi,just like real life!
01-05-2020T01:32:16,SpazztasticKiwi,one step closer to making that dream a real project
01-05-2020T01:32:55,SpazztasticKiwi,dreamtube.....sounds like an adult site...
01-05-2020T01:33:11,Slash0x,Hello

01-05-2020T01:34:04,SageSaga,i also found myself not caring that xeno morph attacked them
01-05-2020T01:34:18,SageSaga,that a xenomorph*
01-05-2020T01:34:51,SpazztasticKiwi,“no....stop...look out......well I tried moving on”

01-05-2020T01:38:02,SageSaga,there's gotta be a way to reset it without doing something super drastic
01-05-2020T01:38:38,SageSaga,im gonna test a few things T_T
01-05-2020T01:39:47,SpazztasticKiwi,save

01-05-2020T01:44:24,SpazztasticKiwi,or it needs calibration
01-05-2020T01:44:32,SpazztasticKiwi,or today’s a bad day
01-05-2020T01:47:53,unsteddyphoenix,Thanks for streamin purp! Great work
01-05-2020T01:49:33,SageSaga,had to unplug it and plug it back in
01-05-2020T01:49:53,Kynum,:ptv-unimpressed:
01-05-2020T01:50:13,SageSaga,thats a pretty long reset though because it has to refresh all my other monitors twice
01-05-2020T01:51:17,SageSaga,that unfortunately means it might not be a software thing and might be the hardware failing T_T
01-05-2020T01:51:51,ZRO4825,That's no bueno. How long you had that tablet now?
01-05-2020T01:54:00,SageSaga,4 years
01-05-2020T01:54:22,ZRO4825,"Oh. I thought you'd gotten a new one lately-ish. Time flies, I suppose."
01-05-2020T01:54:39,SageSaga,yeah i bought this one when i sent my companion in
01-05-2020T01:54:59,SageSaga,the companion was just 2 years- it still works but i can easily stream using it
01-05-2020T01:55:24,SageSaga,thats why i was hoping they would come out with a new Mobile Studio 13
01-05-2020T01:56:02,SageSaga,but instead they got rid of all the options for the mobile studio and just have the 13 and 16 versions at their highest prices
01-05-2020T01:57:10,ZRO4825,oof
01-05-2020T01:59:16,SageSaga,i might just have to upgrade to the new version of what i have
01-05-2020T01:59:21,SageSaga,thats 800 bucks
01-05-2020T01:59:47,Dadrobit,"Mmmm, that reminds me. I need to sit down with a screwdriver and see if I can't fix my preamp. Silly XLR cable is stuck and isn't releasing."
01-05-2020T02:00:44,Dadrobit,"Dunno if the latch is faulty, or if the cable hook hole is janked up somehow."
01-05-2020T02:01:02,SageSaga,that sucks
01-05-2020T02:01:05,Dadrobit,"Eityer way, very moderately mildly irritating."
01-05-2020T02:01:09,Dadrobit,Either*
01-05-2020T02:03:52,Dadrobit,"Otherwise it's still a stellar preamp. Focusrite ISA One. Worth every penny, Paid for itself in a month. Just.... Stuck with the cable that's in it at the moment...."
01-05-2020T02:07:48,SageSaga,i also kinda need a new DAC myself- might want one with a built in preamp
01-05-2020T02:09:17,SageSaga,at least i think its with a preamp? im not super familiar with audio equipment
01-05-2020T02:10:36,SageSaga,i have a device that provides phantom power to my mic and my DAC is ok but it has a tendency to stop working if it gets bumped or moved- which can happen if the cable gets caught on my drawer
01-05-2020T02:11:04,Dadrobit,Honestly I'm actually not incredibly familiar with standalone DACs myself. I just use my microphone interface as a DAC.
01-05-2020T02:11:25,SageSaga,see thats kinda what i want
01-05-2020T02:11:39,SageSaga,i want a device that i can hook my headphones and mic into
01-05-2020T02:12:22,SageSaga,headphones are high impedance so they need more power to get better volume- while my mic is an XLR mic and needs phantom power to run
01-05-2020T02:12:42,Dadrobit,"https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/ScarlettSoloSG3--focusrite-scarlett-solo-studio-3rd-gen-recording-bundle I use this, (well, I use a slightly larger variant)."
01-05-2020T02:13:19,Dadrobit,https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/ScarlettSoloG3--focusrite-scarlett-solo-3rd-gen-usb-audio-interface There we go. Standalone interface
01-05-2020T02:15:21,Dadrobit,"3rd generation came out just a few months back. Every review I can find on them says that they're more of the same as 2nd Gen, but more compact."
01-05-2020T02:17:31,SageSaga,ty Robit- found it on amazon with a 5 month payment plan
01-05-2020T02:17:38,Dadrobit,Not a bad thing by the way. They're mean little pieces of gear
01-05-2020T02:17:47,Dadrobit,"Oh, excellent"
01-05-2020T02:19:14,SageSaga,it wont ship till the end of the month though
01-05-2020T02:19:16,SageSaga,but thats ok
01-05-2020T02:19:32,SageSaga,what i have functions for the most part for now
01-05-2020T02:20:04,Dadrobit,Glad to help my dude.
01-05-2020T02:20:38,SageSaga,the payment plan helps me avoid using my CC which i might have to use for a new tablet
01-05-2020T02:21:06,Dadrobit,"Yeah, that'll be substantially more expensive..."
01-05-2020T02:22:40,SageSaga,hope we get another stimulus check XD
01-05-2020T02:22:56,Dadrobit,If only....
01-05-2020T02:23:00,ZRO4825,Me too. I like feeling rich.
01-05-2020T02:23:06,SageSaga,XD
01-05-2020T02:26:20,SageSaga,"considering the last payment for me was like ""oh yay- half my taxes for last year are back - sure would like the other half-"""
01-05-2020T02:28:12,SageSaga,oh did you see the thing about that landlord that was looking up which of his tenants got their stimulus checks in?
01-05-2020T02:28:56,Dadrobit,I heard about it through my mother. She doesn't think it's real.
01-05-2020T02:29:37,ZRO4825,I hadn't heard 'bout it.
01-05-2020T02:29:42,Dadrobit,Since checking the status of the checks requires more than just a name and an SSN.
01-05-2020T02:29:44,ZRO4825,But I can't say as I'd be surprised.
01-05-2020T02:31:00,SageSaga,"all it requires is a SNN, birthday and address- all things a landlord is likely to have"
01-05-2020T02:31:11,SageSaga,birthday is a bit less normal but not hard to get
01-05-2020T02:31:28,SageSaga,"""how did you get my birthday?"" ""Skype"" ""CRAP!"""
01-05-2020T02:32:17,SageSaga,"""I just went to your facebook page- found the day everyone posted on your wall saying happy birthday and copied the date- i have your age in my files of course"""
01-05-2020T02:32:49,SageSaga,actually- dont some apartments require you to show an id? i wonder how many photocopy the id
01-05-2020T02:33:41,Dadrobit,"Hm, my mother was saying that it required tax information to look her status  up."
01-05-2020T02:34:25,SageSaga,nope
01-05-2020T02:34:37,SageSaga,it only requires that if you need to put in your information
01-05-2020T02:35:01,SageSaga,if you are all set it will just tell you if it was sent already or when it will be mailed
01-05-2020T02:36:43,Dadrobit,I'll have to have a chat with her later then to make sure she isn't giving her info out to fishing sites then...
01-05-2020T02:37:44,SageSaga,you do have to input the tax info if they dont have your bank info to direct deposit or havent started yours yet
01-05-2020T02:38:32,SageSaga,so shes right that you have to put in that info- but as soon as you have you can go back to check on the progress and it wont ask for it again
01-05-2020T02:38:39,SageSaga,it doesnt require any kind of login either
01-05-2020T02:39:26,Dadrobit,"Happened to my brother a bit ago. The latest... Happenings in the government finally convinced him to register to vote. But he tried registering through a Facebook ""click here to register"" ad that looked legit. Just took all his personal info and told him"
01-05-2020T02:39:31,SageSaga,just gives you a nice big warning that its for official US citizen use only and any missuses of the system can be prosecuted under federal law
01-05-2020T02:39:38,Dadrobit,To wait for his confirmation email.
01-05-2020T02:39:57,Dadrobit,Ahhh okay then.
01-05-2020T02:41:18,SageSaga,i wonder what Bill and Melinda Gates did with their check
01-05-2020T02:41:39,Dadrobit,"I only found out because he asked me if my wait time for voter registration was as long as his. Got him properly registered immediately afterwards, but goodness knows who's going to try doing what with the info he gave to those Facebook assholes."
01-05-2020T02:42:30,SageSaga,was it facebook or was it a link from a post or ad on facebook?
01-05-2020T02:42:36,SageSaga,both are bad- but one is still worse
01-05-2020T02:43:35,Dadrobit,Dunno. He said it was a recurring post/ad that he kept seeing that was counting down the days to register to vote to be valid for the next ballot.
01-05-2020T02:44:25,SageSaga,then that means his info could be anywhere or used by anyone nefariously
01-05-2020T02:44:40,Dadrobit,Yuuuup.
01-05-2020T02:45:22,Dadrobit,Also scary to think of the number of people who thought they were registered who are going to find out too late that they can't vote
01-05-2020T02:45:39,SageSaga,if it was facebook that got it- they would use it to direct ads to him and push him stuff while selling his info to more trustworthy advertisers
01-05-2020T02:45:43,Dadrobit,Seriously nefarious shit just for that alone
01-05-2020T02:46:35,SageSaga,i wouldnt be that surprised if they were a partisan group collecting voter info and actually helping register people so long as they were of the group they wanted
01-05-2020T02:46:56,Dadrobit,Cambridge Analytics
01-05-2020T02:47:10,Dadrobit,Analytica*
01-05-2020T02:47:27,SageSaga,i dont think they do business there anymore
01-05-2020T02:47:34,SageSaga,pretty sure Facebook banned them
01-05-2020T02:48:13,Dadrobit,"Same shit, different name."
01-05-2020T02:48:23,SageSaga,im not saying i trust facebook though- i just trust them more that a place pretending to sign people up to vote and dont XD
01-05-2020T02:48:53,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, I just don't really trust big tech, period"
01-05-2020T02:49:12,AspiringNoodle,Ironically coming from a guy who doesn't use a VPN
01-05-2020T02:49:28,AspiringNoodle,Or a non-Google search engine ._.
01-05-2020T02:50:05,SageSaga,nah i dont really trust big tech either- but i also have accepted there's really no way to do what i do and avoid them
01-05-2020T02:50:11,AspiringNoodle,"Google, Twitter, and Facebook in particular have been shown to consistently have an anti-conservative bias."
01-05-2020T02:50:21,AspiringNoodle,And then you got the BS going on with Youtube and Patreon
01-05-2020T02:52:02,SageSaga,i love how often Nazis and white supremacist get called conservative
01-05-2020T02:53:39,SageSaga,"thats generally where the bias comes in- kicking out literally nazis and white supremacist spouting hate speech and they say ""you cant do this! im a conservative!"" and then conservatives all start saying they are under attack- and its like ""dudes-"""
01-05-2020T02:55:08,SageSaga,and i get that not all of the conservatives losing their spots on these sites arent all white supremacist and nazis- but they arent doing a good job at separating themselves from them
01-05-2020T02:55:20,AspiringNoodle,It's not even that.
01-05-2020T02:55:45,AspiringNoodle,"There are two problems at play.  The use of algorithms, and employee bias."
01-05-2020T02:56:11,SageSaga,see that doesnt seem like a good arguement
01-05-2020T02:56:16,AspiringNoodle,"Algorithms tend to be inaccurate because they only focus keywords and ignore intent, context, etc."
01-05-2020T02:56:34,SageSaga,algorithms tend to be too accurate actually
01-05-2020T02:56:52,SageSaga,it causes them to make false positives based on things we dont even think of
01-05-2020T02:56:55,AspiringNoodle,"Tell that to journalists who get banned by the algorithms because they're covering the stuff that algorithms are seeking out, lol"
01-05-2020T02:57:08,SageSaga,i just answered that
01-05-2020T02:57:20,AspiringNoodle,"Ah, so you did."
01-05-2020T02:57:34,SageSaga,employee bias though is much harder to prove
01-05-2020T02:57:42,SpazztasticKiwi,🛌
01-05-2020T02:57:43,AspiringNoodle,We do have data on that.
01-05-2020T02:58:08,AspiringNoodle,"Although, it generally tends to be they apply the rules to one side only."
01-05-2020T02:58:13,SageSaga,"the employees that go back and look at it will just look at ""ok robot- why did you ban this guy? Because hes posting stuff all these nazis said? Well seems legit-"""
01-05-2020T02:59:23,SageSaga,if your lucky you get one of the guys who cares and doesnt worry that he has 15000 accounts to review-
01-05-2020T02:59:47,AspiringNoodle,I'd recommend Tim Pool if you're interested in this stuff :)
01-05-2020T03:00:05,SageSaga,"and he says ""oh this guy was quoting the nazis to keep a record of their arguements as hes writing a paper on the harm of anti-Semite behavior"
01-05-2020T03:00:05,AspiringNoodle,"Although, I get rather annoyed at his chronic fence sitting"
01-05-2020T03:00:44,AspiringNoodle,"Also, I would like to make a point: banning ""nazis"" and other bigoted parties actually backfires"
01-05-2020T03:00:54,SageSaga,doesnt seem to
01-05-2020T03:01:08,SageSaga,deplatforming seems to be very effective
01-05-2020T03:01:14,AspiringNoodle,Wrong
01-05-2020T03:01:19,AspiringNoodle,It extremizes them further
01-05-2020T03:01:28,SageSaga,yeah but it reduces the damage they can do
01-05-2020T03:01:35,AspiringNoodle,"Again, disagree."
01-05-2020T03:02:00,AspiringNoodle,What it will do is force them to seek out groups of other likeminded individuals who were also removed from the social media sphere
01-05-2020T03:02:14,AspiringNoodle,Thus thrusting them into an echo chamber (although social media is already doing a pretty good job of that)
01-05-2020T03:02:34,AspiringNoodle,That is a recipe for a feedback loop that could eventually lead them down the road to terroristic acts.
01-05-2020T03:02:59,Dadrobit,"Blegfhhh, I did not want to do electronics surgery tonight, but this silly port is completely sealed off and soldered in place..."
01-05-2020T03:03:03,SageSaga,yep - and then the government finds it acceptable to kill them
01-05-2020T03:03:12,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/CxdAu7X.jpg
01-05-2020T03:03:29,AspiringNoodle,"While people LOVE to claim that social media and Youtube are great outlets for extremizing normal people, research suggests the opposite, that it actually pulls people AWAY from the extremes"
01-05-2020T03:04:27,SageSaga,i havent seen that proven anywhere- so far it seems like while yes deplatformed people often go off and build their own thing and gain following- their numbers dwindle
01-05-2020T03:04:44,SageSaga,in most cases many of them give up - only the really big ones survive
01-05-2020T03:05:54,SageSaga,last i saw Alex Jones has lost millions of viewers
01-05-2020T03:06:25,SageSaga,his growth rate has turned into a crawl
01-05-2020T03:06:36,SageSaga,it was exploding when he was on twitter and youtube
01-05-2020T03:06:45,AspiringNoodle,"Their numbers may dwindle, but it also strengthens the thoughts of those who stick around"
01-05-2020T03:07:04,AspiringNoodle,"The question becomes, it is better to have 1,000 bigots on social media, or 10 new mass shooters."
01-05-2020T03:07:14,SageSaga,yeah but theres a good chance those people are truly too far gone
01-05-2020T03:07:22,AspiringNoodle,Not necessarily
01-05-2020T03:07:45,SageSaga,anyone still following someone that crazy has to already be pretty broken or crazy themselves
01-05-2020T03:08:05,AspiringNoodle,Which is why exposure to outside sources can still act as a lifeline
01-05-2020T03:08:21,SageSaga,i do think it would be great if we could help those people
01-05-2020T03:08:35,SageSaga,but people who deny reality are very hard to understand much less help
01-05-2020T03:08:54,AspiringNoodle,Psychology could be a great help in that arena
01-05-2020T03:09:05,Dadrobit,$$$$$_
01-05-2020T03:09:08,AspiringNoodle,There's an interesting irony in the human psyche
01-05-2020T03:09:21,SageSaga,they dont believe in psychology though
01-05-2020T03:09:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Thanks for the streamu sage, Nighty night y'all"
01-05-2020T03:09:39,SageSaga,gnight man
01-05-2020T03:09:41,SageSaga,take care!
01-05-2020T03:09:46,AspiringNoodle,"We confronted with information that completely contradicts one's beliefs, it is common for people to completely disregard the new information and further strengthen their beliefs"
01-05-2020T03:09:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,You too
01-05-2020T03:09:48,SageSaga,thats the crazy part- they dont believe in modern medicine
01-05-2020T03:09:52,Dadrobit,"Goodnight, Marv!"
01-05-2020T03:11:00,SageSaga,it just feels like the only option sometimes is to cut them off and let them die- sure they will squirm and fester for a while but if you control it as best as you can and prevent the spread by educating those around them maybe they will burn out
01-05-2020T03:11:01,AspiringNoodle,I think we're getting a bit off track.  Science deniers are another arena entirely
01-05-2020T03:11:29,SageSaga,the problem is a lot of these people that follow these guys are science deniers
01-05-2020T03:12:15,AspiringNoodle,I would caution against the mentality of so easily cutting people off
01-05-2020T03:12:25,SageSaga,yeah i know
01-05-2020T03:12:31,SageSaga,i dont like thinking that way personally
01-05-2020T03:12:47,SageSaga,i really dont but ive been trying to understand these people for a loooooong time and it just doesnt make sense
01-05-2020T03:13:14,ZRO4825,Sometimes people don't leave you any options.
01-05-2020T03:13:38,SageSaga,if you are going to deny everything to hold onto your consipracy theory i dont know how to help
01-05-2020T03:13:59,SageSaga,and it seems like people like that are just going to cause more harm than they can cause good
01-05-2020T03:14:14,ZRO4825,"It's like anti-vaxxers. You don't risk the whole herd (society) by leaving one dumbass unvaccinated amongst the crowd. You separate them, cut'em off."
01-05-2020T03:14:46,ZRO4825,"Till they decide to start playing by rules that don't endanger everyone else, you leave'em that way."
01-05-2020T03:15:00,AspiringNoodle,I would argue that's a bit of an orange vs apples comparison.
01-05-2020T03:15:26,SageSaga,i dont think it is - theres a lot of cross over between people who are anti-vax and people like Alex jones
01-05-2020T03:15:28,ZRO4825,":thinking: Guess I ain't been following the convo close enough then, cuz it doesn't sound all that different to me."
01-05-2020T03:15:42,AspiringNoodle,"And earlier up in the discussion, I warned that by completely cutting them off, you are potentially making the situation worse by insulating them further"
01-05-2020T03:16:08,AspiringNoodle,Echo chambers tend to self-extremize until they can reach a boiling point
01-05-2020T03:16:19,Dadrobit,"It's literally what's happening right now with conservative leaders demanding the country "",open"" to save the economy because Covid is ""overblown"" or a ""hoax""."
01-05-2020T03:16:31,AspiringNoodle,"And honestly, part of the problem is that social media itself tends to do a piss-poor job of exposing people to new ideas"
01-05-2020T03:16:36,SageSaga,"the idea is to let them go crazy, it will be a sacrifice that society can learn from- and i hate that because it means literally sacrificing people but i dont have any better ideas that i believe can work"
01-05-2020T03:16:55,SpazztasticKiwi,deny a fire air and it will die
01-05-2020T03:16:57,AspiringNoodle,"Sage, I would argue that this is a situation that could be avoided with better tech."
01-05-2020T03:17:07,AspiringNoodle,"Hold on, I need to find that graphic"
01-05-2020T03:17:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"deny it resources, it will die"
01-05-2020T03:17:18,SageSaga,Noodle- i think i can agree
01-05-2020T03:17:34,SageSaga,i think some of them can be saved through better application of technology
01-05-2020T03:17:46,AspiringNoodle,That's actually a HUGE part of my argument
01-05-2020T03:17:54,SageSaga,unfortunately the current application is built to make money not make lives better
01-05-2020T03:17:58,AspiringNoodle,Part of the reason things are so bad is BECAUSE social media is so piss poor
01-05-2020T03:18:07,SageSaga,and im not a socialist or a communist
01-05-2020T03:18:08,AspiringNoodle,"And until that is solved, you will NEVER fix this problem. EVER."
01-05-2020T03:18:35,AspiringNoodle,"The graphic I'm trying to find shows Twitter ""bubbles"""
01-05-2020T03:18:59,AspiringNoodle,"Content or individuals who can be classified on one side or the other, and then lines showing where people flow to from that content"
01-05-2020T03:19:21,SageSaga,i just think there are problems created in society by capitalism and i think if profits werent the end goal and instead happiness and intellectual advancement came first we could see some really amazing stuff happen
01-05-2020T03:19:41,AspiringNoodle,And it makes clear that a lot of the stuff thrown at viewers is more or less an echo chamber.  Not much exposure to opposing ideas.
01-05-2020T03:19:54,Dadrobit,That was literally Yang's entire platform. RIP
01-05-2020T03:20:05,AspiringNoodle,Which is part of the reason Twitter is such a hell-hole for politics
01-05-2020T03:20:13,AspiringNoodle,"Youtube is actually somewhat decent, though."
01-05-2020T03:20:18,SageSaga,Yeah yang did have a plan for getting people to interact more didnt he?
01-05-2020T03:20:28,SageSaga,what was it called?
01-05-2020T03:21:16,AspiringNoodle,"Ugh, I wish I had found out where Tim found those graphics..."
01-05-2020T03:21:19,AspiringNoodle,Would be so useful right now
01-05-2020T03:21:29,SageSaga,he had this concept to have people forced to do something together like once a month and it would put people in a position to work with people of other religions and nations and ethnic groups
01-05-2020T03:21:50,Dadrobit,"His plan was to stop using GDP as the be all end all statistic and start implementing others like substance abuse, stress levels, and other human centric statistics as measurements to guide policies."
01-05-2020T03:22:44,Dadrobit,I think I recall something like that? It wasn't a mainline policy of his that I know of though. Not like his healthcare and UBI policies at least.
01-05-2020T03:22:44,SageSaga,yeah but didnt he have a social project?
01-05-2020T03:22:47,AspiringNoodle,Found one :D
01-05-2020T03:22:54,AspiringNoodle,Political flowchart for Youtube
01-05-2020T03:22:56,AspiringNoodle,https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*bWXMBvcKEwTHHu-xI-824Q.png
01-05-2020T03:23:21,AspiringNoodle,Now if only I could find the twitter one
01-05-2020T03:24:19,SageSaga,what is this even actually showing?
01-05-2020T03:24:30,SageSaga,like- this looks like what you would expect-
01-05-2020T03:25:01,SpazztasticKiwi,yeeeeeaah
01-05-2020T03:25:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m out
01-05-2020T03:25:06,Dadrobit,"I think their was some ""social credit"" plan he was spitballing where you could help other people in your neighborhood and receive credit for those services."
01-05-2020T03:25:08,SageSaga,XD
01-05-2020T03:25:11,SageSaga,take care Kiwi
01-05-2020T03:25:18,SageSaga,thanks for sticking it out- we have gone political
01-05-2020T03:25:22,Dadrobit,Cya spazz
01-05-2020T03:25:31,AspiringNoodle,The chart shows the flow of traffic from the 3 primary political groups
01-05-2020T03:25:43,ZRO4825,Looks like bullshit to me.
01-05-2020T03:25:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I was following out of curiosity but I should actually go to bed
01-05-2020T03:25:48,SageSaga,yeah but it shows it exactly as you would expect- theres nothing new there
01-05-2020T03:25:57,ZRO4825,Have a g'night Kiwi ^_^
01-05-2020T03:26:01,SpazztasticKiwi,the work awaits tomorrow
01-05-2020T03:26:08,SageSaga,we love you Kiwi! sleep tight!
01-05-2020T03:26:11,AspiringNoodle,What the data shows is actually pretty good
01-05-2020T03:26:19,SpazztasticKiwi,💗💗💗
01-05-2020T03:26:36,SageSaga,Noodle- its neutral- its not good or bad-
01-05-2020T03:26:38,Dadrobit,I dunno if he ever fleshed it out or if it was just and idea he tossed out on... I think it was the Freakanomics podcast?
01-05-2020T03:27:02,AspiringNoodle,"Starting with the ""Left"", the vast majority flows into more ""left"" content.  With a smaller chunk moving towards the center, and an even smaller chunk viewing ""right"" content"
01-05-2020T03:27:14,SageSaga,"content sending left to right stuff and right to left stuff can just be attributed to interest in what ""the enemy is doing"""
01-05-2020T03:27:42,AspiringNoodle,"Or ""exposure to new ideas"""
01-05-2020T03:27:57,SageSaga,it doesnt give you any data on what effect it had like making people more left or more right or strengthening ideas
01-05-2020T03:28:27,SageSaga,yeah but im saying it doesnt do any of that- it's not proof of any change- just that something happens
01-05-2020T03:29:09,SageSaga,"now if like 80% of Right wing stuff got sent to left wing recommendations we might say ""Looks like the algorithm is pushing left views on right wing people"""
01-05-2020T03:29:35,SageSaga,but theres no data to be taken from just this chart without further information
01-05-2020T03:30:03,SageSaga,like how long were videos viewed- or percentages viewed and time spent on new content
01-05-2020T03:30:35,SageSaga,basically- its a pretty chart but it doesnt provide any real information to draw from
01-05-2020T03:31:30,SageSaga,i guess when you saw this chart this Tim guy was talking about what it showed or something right? maybe he had more in depth information on it
01-05-2020T03:31:41,AspiringNoodle,Tim Pool
01-05-2020T03:32:00,SageSaga,yes! Tim Guy
01-05-2020T03:32:08,AspiringNoodle,"Left-leaning centrist, self-described Democrat, hates Trump, criticizes the Left all day :P"
01-05-2020T03:32:15,SageSaga,i know
01-05-2020T03:32:19,SageSaga,i looked him up already
01-05-2020T03:32:34,AspiringNoodle,"I love that like 80% of his comments are ""swallow the f*cking pill!"""
01-05-2020T03:33:02,SageSaga,does he immerse himself in right wing people?
01-05-2020T03:33:14,AspiringNoodle,"Nope, they just happen to like his content"
01-05-2020T03:33:59,AspiringNoodle,"He calls it as he sees it.  And the past few years has just been a plethora of material for him to go ""wtf"" to"
01-05-2020T03:34:51,SageSaga,i dont like looking up people and seeing the people also searched for- and it shows like - Ben Shapiro or Steven Crowder =_=
01-05-2020T03:35:20,AspiringNoodle,He has 3 channels. Timcast - Him giving his opinion on interesting news topics. Tim Pool - More in-depth videos that he spends a good chunk of the day researching.  And Timcast IRL - I think it's like a podcast.
01-05-2020T03:36:16,SageSaga,i have heard of timcast but never listened to it before
01-05-2020T03:37:04,AspiringNoodle,"It's okay if you don't.  Like I said, that's more of his personal opinion on interesting news topics.  He puts out anywhere from 3 - 5 videos a day for that channel"
01-05-2020T03:37:42,AspiringNoodle,"His main channel is 1 video a day, roughly 25 minutes long, which he spends a fair amount of time doing research, and does more of an analysis of what's going on."
01-05-2020T03:37:51,SageSaga,i'll probably check him out- i probably dont need more of this though unless he has the secret to getting through to science deniers
01-05-2020T03:38:55,Dadrobit,It's hard to impossible to use facts and logic to correct someone's ideas when they never used facts or logic to obtain those ideas in the first place...
01-05-2020T03:38:59,AspiringNoodle,"Straight warning, I think part of the reason republicans like his content is that he has the whole title / thumbnail business down, lol"
01-05-2020T03:39:20,Dadrobit,Also because he hates socialism.
01-05-2020T03:39:22,SageSaga,click bait master- got it
01-05-2020T03:39:37,SageSaga,he does? wasnt he a bernie supporter?
01-05-2020T03:39:37,AspiringNoodle,"Well, to be fair, he actually does elaborate in detail"
01-05-2020T03:40:15,AspiringNoodle,But a more recent criticism is that he might be starting to sensationalize things like he criticizes the MSM of doing
01-05-2020T03:41:09,Dadrobit,"Supports Bernie, but Bernie's is a Social Democrat, not a socialist."
01-05-2020T03:41:18,AspiringNoodle,Here's an example of what I'm talking about.  Here's a video title from a day and a half ago
01-05-2020T03:41:26,AspiringNoodle,"Unsealed Documents CONFIRM FBI Plot Against Trump Staff, Michael Flynn, Agents Sought to TRAP Flynn"
01-05-2020T03:41:49,SageSaga,oh yeah right people love that stuff
01-05-2020T03:41:56,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I would literally never click that."
01-05-2020T03:42:00,SageSaga,XD
01-05-2020T03:42:04,AspiringNoodle,"Thumbnail cuts out everything after Staff, replaces staff with Personnel"
01-05-2020T03:42:09,ZRO4825,On a completely random and unrelated note: My Cinnamon and Maple swimsuit figures should actually be getting mailed out soon. =D
01-05-2020T03:42:20,AspiringNoodle,"And text in thumbnail is all caps, with ""CONFIRM"" in big red."
01-05-2020T03:42:33,SageSaga,"im sorry Zro for a second there i said to myself ""That sounds delicious"""
01-05-2020T03:42:43,Dadrobit,Same actually
01-05-2020T03:42:44,ZRO4825,I mean...not *entirely* incorrect?
01-05-2020T03:42:47,AspiringNoodle,"I will give him one thing, he does a good job at making an eye catching thumbnail"
01-05-2020T03:43:12,AspiringNoodle,Will the figures induce *peak* thirst?
01-05-2020T03:43:20,ZRO4825,And Cinnamon and Maple DO go well together. :thinking:
01-05-2020T03:43:25,Dadrobit,Sounds about as eye catching as a low hanging branch.
01-05-2020T03:43:39,AspiringNoodle,"Dadro, believe it or not there's a science to this, haha"
01-05-2020T03:44:09,ZRO4825,There's a science to everything if you care to dig deep enough into it to find it.
01-05-2020T03:44:20,AspiringNoodle,An eye catching thumbnail makes more people likely to click.  That's its job.
01-05-2020T03:44:32,Dadrobit,"I know, that kinda stuff doesn't work with me though. I find over the top to be irritating."
01-05-2020T03:44:36,SageSaga,does that series have any dark skin beauties?
01-05-2020T03:44:47,ZRO4825,"Not as of yet, Sage~"
01-05-2020T03:44:53,SageSaga,laaaame
01-05-2020T03:44:59,AspiringNoodle,"That said, clicking is only part of it"
01-05-2020T03:45:16,AspiringNoodle,Need people to share the videos and or finish them in their entirety to drive more views.
01-05-2020T03:45:41,AspiringNoodle,"Considering he's at 738k subscribers and gets about 200k - 400k views a video, he's doing a good job."
01-05-2020T03:46:52,SageSaga,shouldnt gauge success on views
01-05-2020T03:47:00,ZRO4825,"Reminds me though, I'm 'bout due for a re....rewatch? Replay? Reread? of the Nekopara series."
01-05-2020T03:47:23,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, I don't"
01-05-2020T03:47:24,ZRO4825,Always the great thing 'bout re-running a series though. You can skip the parts you know are boring. :joy:
01-05-2020T03:47:44,AspiringNoodle,He also tends to have 96%+ like / dislike ratios on his vids
01-05-2020T03:48:08,AspiringNoodle,"And if he ever has a bad take, he doesn't take down the video, doesn't curate comments, doesn't double down"
01-05-2020T03:48:20,AspiringNoodle,He takes a step back and reexamines where he went wrong.
01-05-2020T03:48:23,ZRO4825,"awww hell, mistakes have been made. Steam has a sale going on."
01-05-2020T03:49:09,SageSaga,ah the Star Wars game hasnt hit 50% yet-
01-05-2020T03:49:46,ZRO4825,"I know, kinda waiting for that myself."
01-05-2020T03:49:46,SageSaga,im gonna need dragon quest to hit 60+% off before i dive in
01-05-2020T03:49:53,ZRO4825,Which one?
01-05-2020T03:50:00,SageSaga,DQ XI
01-05-2020T03:51:04,AspiringNoodle,"Sage, I recommend checking out Tim's Wiki if you're unsure"
01-05-2020T03:51:31,SageSaga,i'll give his content a shot- if i dont like him oh well- not a big deal
01-05-2020T03:51:40,AspiringNoodle,"I was doing a double check on his career summary, and I can't find any major faults with it"
01-05-2020T03:51:40,ZRO4825,Hmm...DQ XI via SE's own store for $30
01-05-2020T03:51:49,AspiringNoodle,It definitely matches with what I remember about his accomplishments
01-05-2020T03:52:03,ZRO4825,But that's only %50
01-05-2020T03:52:09,ZRO4825,%50 off
01-05-2020T03:52:11,ZRO4825,"wth, lmfao"
01-05-2020T03:52:13,ZRO4825,% 50
01-05-2020T03:52:32,ZRO4825,Apparently when you put that all together the chat reads it as a P XD
01-05-2020T03:52:47,SageSaga,i think i see it fine-
01-05-2020T03:53:23,SageSaga,isnt it weird though that we write %50 but we say 50%?
01-05-2020T03:53:46,ZRO4825,"Honestly, I was sitting here trying to figure out why I was putting the % first because that doesn't make any damned sense."
01-05-2020T03:54:05,ZRO4825,But I honestly can't remember the last time I used it like that...
01-05-2020T03:55:44,AspiringNoodle,See you guys next week / Sunday maybe
01-05-2020T03:55:47,SageSaga,but Noodle- i think im only really interested in new political content if they can explain how to get people of a view you feel is very negative and illogical- and get them to see it that way or explain their view in a way that makes logical sense
01-05-2020T03:55:56,AspiringNoodle,Gotta finish this work then go to bed so I can get ready for work at the gas station >_>
01-05-2020T03:55:57,SageSaga,alright take care man have a great night!
01-05-2020T03:56:18,AspiringNoodle,"Personally, I wish I'd start watching his main channel"
01-05-2020T03:56:19,BadFoMo,Good night.
01-05-2020T03:56:21,Dadrobit,o/ Asp
01-05-2020T03:56:34,AspiringNoodle,The Flynn story seems extra juicy
01-05-2020T03:56:44,Dadrobit,"Also, I write things as 50%"
01-05-2020T03:57:10,SageSaga,so does Steam these days
01-05-2020T03:57:19,ZRO4825,"I usually do too, Dadro, which is why I'm so confused as to why i was doing % first this time, lmao"
01-05-2020T03:57:38,SageSaga,but like most computers and things like that say PERCENT VALUE rather than Value Percent
01-05-2020T03:59:36,SageSaga,here's my general issue that keeps freakn happening with political disagreements =
01-05-2020T04:00:27,SageSaga,"""I believe in this because of this data!"" ""Ah good you have data! Let me see! . . . this... this doesnt say what you think it does"" ""Yes it does! See! The line is big here and small here! That is bad!"" ""This is upside down"" ""What?"""
01-05-2020T04:01:12,ZRO4825,"oooh, Elhaym Von Houten figure....but $70....oof."
01-05-2020T04:01:41,SageSaga,not worth
01-05-2020T04:02:10,ZRO4825,"It's a Bring Arts figure from Square-Enix, so...payin partially just for the name, tbh. But yeah, I agree."
01-05-2020T04:02:47,ZRO4825,"Posable figure and all that jazz, and I love Elly's design but...idk, just hard to justify spending anything north of $40 on a figure for myself."
01-05-2020T04:03:07,SageSaga,is it poseable?
01-05-2020T04:03:23,ZRO4825,Yup
01-05-2020T04:03:29,ZRO4825,Here's the link to it~  https://store.na.square-enix-games.com/en_US/product/482311/xenogears-bring-arts-elehayym-elly-van-houten-action-figure
01-05-2020T04:03:39,SageSaga,imo - pose able is no good
01-05-2020T04:04:09,ZRO4825,"I get the appeal of it, but at the same time, idk, makes'em feel...breakable."
01-05-2020T04:04:10,SageSaga,a lot of compromises have to be made in a figure to make it poseable
01-05-2020T04:04:28,SageSaga,i much prefer the figures as works of art
01-05-2020T04:04:41,ZRO4825,"I've got a couple of poseable figures of Zero from the Mega Man X series, and both of'em feel like I'm gonna break'em if I have to move a part wrong, ya know?"
01-05-2020T04:04:42,SageSaga,literally - they take artwork of a character and make it a figure
01-05-2020T04:04:55,SageSaga,yeah most feel that way
01-05-2020T04:05:00,Dadrobit,"Ahhhh, I miss the days when I thought it was outrageous to pay a lot of money for figurines.... Then my Play Arts Kai shelf started getting populated..."
01-05-2020T04:05:12,ZRO4825,lol Dadro
01-05-2020T04:05:32,SageSaga,the only poseables im ok with are the nendoroids
01-05-2020T04:05:36,ZRO4825,"In my defense, I found out recently that my state apparently is dead last for the income list of the US, so, my view on money is pretty damend cheap. :P"
01-05-2020T04:05:46,ZRO4825,damned*
01-05-2020T04:05:54,Dadrobit,I have self control at least. Managed to convince myself to not get the Cloud on his bike figure with the FF7 Remake super deluxe package.
01-05-2020T04:06:04,ZRO4825,My friend did not resist that siren call.
01-05-2020T04:06:09,ZRO4825,I did.
01-05-2020T04:06:16,Dadrobit,Fuck do I regret that decision
01-05-2020T04:06:24,SageSaga,XD
01-05-2020T04:06:37,SageSaga,im just gonna get the game when it comes out on PC
01-05-2020T04:06:38,ZRO4825,"Well, more specifically I looked at it and went ""That's 90% of a car payment for a month. I can't afford that."" because I couldn't at the time."
01-05-2020T04:07:19,SageSaga,yall see that bullcrap?!
01-05-2020T04:07:35,SageSaga,Did yall see that?!
01-05-2020T04:08:07,ZRO4825,"<_>;; I missed whatever it was, because I was lookin at Steam. :c"
01-05-2020T04:08:10,SageSaga,T_T
01-05-2020T04:08:13,Dadrobit,"Sorry, I'm actually playing Bloodborne and just chatting on the phone..."
01-05-2020T04:08:28,ZRO4825,Tablet freak out again?
01-05-2020T04:08:47,SageSaga,the palm rejection is like practically gone
01-05-2020T04:08:58,ZRO4825,:c
01-05-2020T04:09:27,SageSaga,it started grabbing the side window- with the navigator and layers and kept pulling it out half way over the screen- then back to normal then back to the middle rapidly over and over
01-05-2020T04:10:01,ZRO4825,@.@
01-05-2020T04:10:46,Dadrobit,Who needs workflow anyways?
01-05-2020T04:11:56,SageSaga,i have a button that lets me turn off touch but it means i gotta toggle it to move around- i didnt have to do that before
01-05-2020T04:13:55,Dadrobit,"Yeah, ain't nobody likes ghettorigging their established setup."
01-05-2020T04:13:55,ZRO4825,"oooh, Senran Kagura Peach Ball for 50%"
01-05-2020T04:14:20,SageSaga,<_< >_> *checks what that is*
01-05-2020T04:14:29,ZRO4825,Senran Kagura pinball game! =D
01-05-2020T04:14:38,SageSaga,booo
01-05-2020T04:15:19,SageSaga,if it was volley ball or tennis i might consider it- i like those games sometimes
01-05-2020T04:15:32,SageSaga,and big boobie anime girls playing them is even better
01-05-2020T04:16:42,SageSaga,Zro- have you watched Ascendance of a Bookworm yet?
01-05-2020T04:16:51,SageSaga,dont know if Robit was interested in it-
01-05-2020T04:17:14,BadFoMo,What is it about?
01-05-2020T04:17:23,ZRO4825,I haven't even *heard* of that till you mentioned it earlier.
01-05-2020T04:17:32,SageSaga,i told you about it months ago!
01-05-2020T04:17:56,ZRO4825,".....I'm not going to argue that, because you likely did and I forgot. :x"
01-05-2020T04:17:57,SageSaga,its the story of a girl who dies just as she got her dream job
01-05-2020T04:17:59,BadFoMo,My memory is ****.
01-05-2020T04:18:12,SageSaga,the song right now is the intro
01-05-2020T04:18:41,ZRO4825,ahhh
01-05-2020T04:19:08,Dadrobit,"Mmm, yeah, I remember you talking about it."
01-05-2020T04:19:10,SageSaga,so anywho- she dies and gets reincarnated in this world that is like medieval times - and into a poor family and only nobles have books- most commoners can just write their name at most
01-05-2020T04:19:25,SageSaga,shes also very sickly
01-05-2020T04:19:33,SageSaga,and turns out shes freakn dying
01-05-2020T04:19:40,SageSaga,AGAIN!
01-05-2020T04:20:13,BadFoMo,...I don't remember any of this.
01-05-2020T04:20:28,SageSaga,but it also turns out her illness is caused by an abundance of mana- so she has all this magical power but cant freakn get it out of her body because you need magical items to use magic
01-05-2020T04:21:10,SageSaga,and only nobles have magical items - the few commoners who somehow gain magic just die
01-05-2020T04:21:54,ZRO4825,Interesting
01-05-2020T04:21:59,SageSaga,but she works her way up as a child by proving she has all this knowledge on how to create basic modern crafts- but to the people in this time period they are luxury items
01-05-2020T04:22:15,SageSaga,she has an unhealthy obsession with books!
01-05-2020T04:22:34,SageSaga,it borders on insanity :P not really but its pretty important to her
01-05-2020T04:22:44,ZRO4825,lol
01-05-2020T04:22:53,SageSaga,so she wants to make books and ends up making plant based paper
01-05-2020T04:23:01,SageSaga,in a world that only has vellum!
01-05-2020T04:23:02,BadFoMo,Sounds a little like the gire in Read or Die.
01-05-2020T04:23:21,BadFoMo,*girl
01-05-2020T04:23:22,ZRO4825,"And I think I just hit my cue to go to bed, since I just zoned out hard for a moment there."
01-05-2020T04:23:35,SageSaga,ok Zro- but watch the show!
01-05-2020T04:23:37,ZRO4825,I'm honestly surprised I've stayed awake this long though.
01-05-2020T04:23:38,BadFoMo,Good night?
01-05-2020T04:23:39,SageSaga,season 2 started already!
01-05-2020T04:23:45,ZRO4825,I've worked a touch over 30 hours in the past 3 days.
01-05-2020T04:24:16,SageSaga,yikes
01-05-2020T04:24:18,Dadrobit,o/ zro
01-05-2020T04:24:34,ZRO4825,"Yeah. And I ain't young like I used to be. This shit's not fun anymore, lmao."
01-05-2020T04:24:40,SageSaga,you are a saint in Wolves clothing Zro
01-05-2020T04:25:23,ZRO4825,"But yeah, aight, I'm out. You guys have a good one. ^^/"
01-05-2020T04:25:36,Dadrobit,It did sound moderately interesting. Never put in the time to watch with though. Recently picked up JoJos.
01-05-2020T04:25:40,SageSaga,rest well - relax sometime and watch the show
01-05-2020T04:25:51,SageSaga,i got Tom to start reading the books!
01-05-2020T04:25:57,SageSaga,He finished Book 1 and 2
01-05-2020T04:26:13,SageSaga,they arent super long and they are very easy reads
01-05-2020T04:26:40,SageSaga,also Tom needs to research light novels because he wants to write one like i do
01-05-2020T04:26:59,Dadrobit,Manga or light novels?
01-05-2020T04:27:06,Dadrobit,"Oh, there it is lol"
01-05-2020T04:29:24,Dadrobit,"Man, it's been so long since I've even held a light novels. Literally well over a decade."
01-05-2020T04:29:49,SageSaga,i read em on my kindle
01-05-2020T04:31:27,Dadrobit,"I have a hard time reading off of a phone/tablet. It just doesn't feel as comfy. Silly I know, but the act of turning a page is just very oddly soothing to me."
01-05-2020T04:31:46,SageSaga,i get that
01-05-2020T04:31:56,SageSaga,but i ran out of space on my bookshelf years ago
01-05-2020T04:33:24,Dadrobit,"I need more shelves myself. Used to stop in a local book store almost every week to pick up new books to read at work lol. But they shuttered permanently a few months back, so my collection stopped growing."
01-05-2020T04:33:49,SageSaga,basically i moved into my new home years ago- my grandfather built me a custom bookshelf that ran across an entire wall of my room- i filled up 80% of it- and a year later there was no more room
01-05-2020T04:34:46,Dadrobit,Pops did the same for me as a kid. Though it was a Mish mash of books and Lego creations at the time :)
01-05-2020T04:35:48,SageSaga,my grandfather was in the army just after WW2 - then became a professional carpenter- and he still does carpentry jobs as a hobby
01-05-2020T04:36:09,SageSaga,he even later made me a display case to go on top of my book shelf for all my figures
01-05-2020T04:38:55,SageSaga,might need to see if he can make me one i can put on the wall above my bed at this rate-
01-05-2020T04:38:56,Dadrobit,"Pops taught carpentry starting off his career as a teacher/professor. Did something similar as well. One of the levels of the book shelves he ran along the wall, he hinged on some plexiglass to flip up so I could have a dedicated spot for the models I had"
01-05-2020T04:41:13,SageSaga,well im finally done
01-05-2020T04:41:16,SageSaga,just before 6am
01-05-2020T04:41:38,SageSaga,gnight crazy folks still watching and or hanging out!
01-05-2020T04:41:41,Dadrobit,Right on man. You made it.
01-05-2020T04:41:50,Dadrobit,Tech difficulties and al
01-05-2020T04:41:51,Dadrobit,all
01-05-2020T04:42:07,Dadrobit,"Oh, and a quick question before you head out?"
01-05-2020T04:42:14,SageSaga,sure
01-05-2020T04:42:41,Dadrobit,Have you heard from Lann at all? I heard from unsteddy that he went dark and deleted the Discord server?
01-05-2020T04:42:50,SageSaga,yes
01-05-2020T04:43:06,SageSaga,Lann has me and one other person from his friends list still active
01-05-2020T04:43:45,Dadrobit,Damn man... I liked chilling and gaming with the folks in there.
01-05-2020T04:43:48,SageSaga,hes fine- hes just taking drastic action to take control of his life again
01-05-2020T04:43:59,SageSaga,yeah i also scolded him for deleting the channel like that
01-05-2020T04:44:02,Dadrobit,Good to hear he's all right though.
01-05-2020T04:44:58,Dadrobit,"Yeah, most other servers from 'round here can be a bit.... ""Much"" at times if you know what I mean. It was a good place to just chill and game."
01-05-2020T04:45:02,SageSaga,long story short he had become very unhappy with his life and also had broken up with his girlfriend - bunch of other crap going on- he decided to sever himself from the internet and most of his friends there
01-05-2020T04:45:21,SageSaga,yeah he should have left the server alone- he had other admins on it to deal with it
01-05-2020T04:45:49,SageSaga,severe*
01-05-2020T04:46:21,SageSaga,severe isnt how you spell it either! dangit!
01-05-2020T04:46:31,Dadrobit,Sever was right
01-05-2020T04:46:48,SageSaga,it was- i thought i wrote Server
01-05-2020T04:46:55,Dadrobit,Ha
01-05-2020T04:47:00,Dadrobit,Ah*
01-05-2020T04:47:05,SageSaga,lol - take care man
01-05-2020T04:47:17,SageSaga,i think ha was more correct :P
01-05-2020T04:47:17,Dadrobit,"Alright, have a good one. See ya next time"
01-05-2020T04:47:26,BadFoMo,Bye.
01-05-2020T04:47:26,Dadrobit,:)
01-05-2020T04:47:37,SageSaga,byeeeee Bad!

01-05-2020T14:40:12,CrimsonQuill,"I had trouble this week, since mine was sketched last month"
01-05-2020T14:40:25,CrimsonQuill,I always have trouble when its finally doodled what to suggest next.
01-05-2020T14:40:37,TeapotOfDoom,more backstory
01-05-2020T14:40:43,TeapotOfDoom,MOAR LOAR
01-05-2020T14:41:07,CrimsonQuill,I did think of another RaineXRed...but I'm kinda apprehensive of that person on patreon and Deviantart who seems to REALLY have it out for Red.
01-05-2020T14:41:17,CrimsonQuill,So I thought of a Lore sketch instead.
01-05-2020T14:41:38,TeapotOfDoom,meh haters gonna hate
01-05-2020T14:41:42,CrimsonQuill,"Remember in Chapter 18, one of the signs on Edinmire's board says 'Wreathwood Razed'?"
01-05-2020T14:41:48,CrimsonQuill,I wanna see how it happened
01-05-2020T14:41:59,CrimsonQuill,"If it doesn't work this week, I might try something else"
01-05-2020T14:42:09,TeapotOfDoom,oh dang the deep lore
01-05-2020T14:42:16,CrimsonQuill,"...though Red and Karen don't get enough screentime, tbh"
01-05-2020T14:42:25,CrimsonQuill,Maybe a Karen sketch. Give her some time in the sun!
01-05-2020T14:42:40,sunblaze,yesss gonna boost the lesser used chars.
01-05-2020T14:42:43,sunblaze,I totally agree
01-05-2020T14:42:46,TeapotOfDoom,literally? xD
01-05-2020T14:42:55,CrimsonQuill,THERE'S an idea
01-05-2020T14:43:04,sunblaze,:ptv-snicker:
01-05-2020T14:43:04,CrimsonQuill,Karen on some sort of Booster Rocket thing...
01-05-2020T14:43:10,CrimsonQuill,She could be an astronaut!
01-05-2020T14:43:26,CrimsonQuill,"Astronaut Karen, on the first mission to Gaynmede!"
01-05-2020T14:43:30,sunblaze,To the skieeeeees!
01-05-2020T14:43:47,SageSaga,im good for Karen Crim but- dont let dickbags form what you choose for what you want
01-05-2020T14:44:00,TeapotOfDoom,Hi my name is Karen and this is THE BIG RED ROCKET!
01-05-2020T14:44:15,sunblaze,feels like a dickbag :ptv-sad:
01-05-2020T14:44:16,CrimsonQuill,@SageSaga Thanks Sage...
01-05-2020T14:44:24,CrimsonQuill,...
01-05-2020T14:44:26,CrimsonQuill,I won't.
01-05-2020T14:45:40,CrimsonQuill,I won't let anyone do that.
01-05-2020T14:45:44,SageSaga,sunblaze- are you going around calling fictional characters racist for being born in a society that normalizes said racism without taking into account the progress that person has made?
01-05-2020T14:46:31,CrimsonQuill,"@SageSaga Unless Sunblaze's Patreon Username is 'MoppyPuppy', I think you can excuse them Sage."
01-05-2020T14:46:33,sunblaze,of course not. its a) fictional and b) not the point
01-05-2020T14:46:50,SageSaga,then dont feel like a dickbag!
01-05-2020T14:47:53,SageSaga,Crim - i know Sunblaze isnt that person im just saying Sun shouldnt feel like a dickbag :P
01-05-2020T14:47:55,sunblaze,then I have no idea what you are takling about but sure will not do
01-05-2020T14:48:02,CrimsonQuill,XD
01-05-2020T14:48:04,CrimsonQuill,Sorry
01-05-2020T14:48:09,CrimsonQuill,I will admit
01-05-2020T14:48:20,CrimsonQuill,Tonight I kinda wanna finish my little doodle
01-05-2020T14:48:48,CrimsonQuill,I started a little RvB Crossover page based on a year-old comment someone made on 'Halo Raine' Deviantart submission
01-05-2020T14:48:56,CrimsonQuill,But I've been sitting on it all week
01-05-2020T14:49:14,CrimsonQuill,"(I know this has nothing to do with the subject at hand, I am sorry)"
01-05-2020T14:51:16,SageSaga,my touch is screwed up again - gonna see if quickly unplugging and plugging fixes it
01-05-2020T14:51:28,CrimsonQuill,LOL
01-05-2020T14:51:41,CrimsonQuill,I'm gonna see if I can fit Flora and Tucker into the same panel
01-05-2020T14:52:24,SageSaga,man that is an annoying fix
01-05-2020T14:55:42,TeapotOfDoom,so it survived
01-05-2020T14:56:00,SageSaga,?
01-05-2020T14:56:17,TeapotOfDoom,you said a part of it died last week
01-05-2020T14:56:31,TeapotOfDoom,haven't been here since
01-05-2020T14:56:36,SageSaga,wat
01-05-2020T14:57:04,SageSaga,i streamed for 5 hours last night
01-05-2020T14:57:11,ZRO4825,"Yeah, but Tea wasn't here. :P"
01-05-2020T14:57:13,SageSaga,. .
01-05-2020T14:57:16,SageSaga,8 hours
01-05-2020T14:57:17,SageSaga,not 5
01-05-2020T14:57:26,ZRO4825,"Speaking of which, work time! Take care!"
01-05-2020T14:57:27,TeapotOfDoom,european time zone
01-05-2020T14:57:33,TeapotOfDoom,bye kali
01-05-2020T14:57:41,TeapotOfDoom,i was asleep xD
01-05-2020T14:57:46,SageSaga,i streamed from 9pm to almost 6am EDT
01-05-2020T14:58:07,CrimsonQuill,trips and knocks over proverbial chattable
01-05-2020T14:58:12,CrimsonQuill,Owch
01-05-2020T14:58:16,TeapotOfDoom,6am holy shit
01-05-2020T14:58:41,CrimsonQuill,Seriously
01-05-2020T14:58:50,CrimsonQuill,That's a rough ride.
01-05-2020T14:59:24,TeapotOfDoom,my creativity tends to die at around 1am. 6am is hardcore
01-05-2020T15:01:51,TeapotOfDoom,but 9pm edt to 6am edt is exactly the time frame i use to sleep
01-05-2020T15:02:02,TeapotOfDoom,like bang on xD
01-05-2020T15:05:19,CrimsonQuill,I hate drawing hands
01-05-2020T15:05:27,TeapotOfDoom,who doesn't
01-05-2020T15:05:30,CrimsonQuill,I can't draw individual fingers
01-05-2020T15:05:44,SageSaga,i actually have come to kinda like hands-
01-05-2020T15:06:12,CrimsonQuill,"Heck, Tom was better than I am at drawing hands before his art even started! As for Sage...self explanatory"
01-05-2020T15:06:13,TeapotOfDoom,what did you promise the fiend you struck that deal with?
01-05-2020T15:06:29,SageSaga,*Stockholm syndrome*
01-05-2020T15:06:37,sunblaze,^probably to draw him the 2 comics :D
01-05-2020T15:08:15,SageSaga,actually- drawing hands decent or even sometimes well makes images look a lot better in general- because people look to the hands often to assess skill these days
01-05-2020T15:08:46,SageSaga,if the hands all look horrible or if worse- you always hide them- it shows the person has little or no confidence in their art
01-05-2020T15:09:10,CrimsonQuill,Me then
01-05-2020T15:09:15,CrimsonQuill,I hide hands a lot
01-05-2020T15:09:20,CrimsonQuill,I can draw 'em splayed
01-05-2020T15:09:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Me o/
01-05-2020T15:09:29,CrimsonQuill,And maybe in fists with difficult
01-05-2020T15:09:35,SageSaga,put em out there and practice!
01-05-2020T15:09:36,CrimsonQuill,But...curling fingers...
01-05-2020T15:09:40,CrimsonQuill,shivers
01-05-2020T15:09:53,CrimsonQuill,But they're a big part of the thing I'm drawing.
01-05-2020T15:10:00,SageSaga,""""
01-05-2020T15:10:20,CrimsonQuill,"Trace backing away from Sarge (who doesn't like his blue hair), hands raised in panic..."
01-05-2020T15:10:35,SageSaga,"""So i have this comic idea about this guy who's hands talk- problem is- i cant draw hands- so ive replaced his hands with heads"""
01-05-2020T15:10:59,CrimsonQuill,"Flora with her claws out, because Tucker's trying to hit on her (As he trys with every 'chick' he sees)"
01-05-2020T15:11:07,CrimsonQuill,And Caboose petting Kathrin nonchalantly.
01-05-2020T15:11:26,CrimsonQuill,Sooo....yep. Hands. I am terrified.
01-05-2020T15:11:36,CrimsonQuill,But if I fail...I shall fail SPECTACULARLY!
01-05-2020T15:13:46,SageSaga,there are some very good hand tutorials out there
01-05-2020T15:14:00,SageSaga,theres a lot of different methods to drawing hands
01-05-2020T15:15:06,CrimsonQuill,I've seen some...kinda
01-05-2020T15:25:47,TeapotOfDoom,yay we're going after a monster for the first time in the campaign
01-05-2020T15:25:54,CrimsonQuill,:)
01-05-2020T15:26:00,TeapotOfDoom,and we've finally got a quest board whoo
01-05-2020T15:26:53,SageSaga,?
01-05-2020T15:27:13,TeapotOfDoom,i'm in the midst of dnd myself
01-05-2020T15:27:32,SageSaga,noice
01-05-2020T15:28:11,TeapotOfDoom,and we were travelling for 2 weeks or so and have now arrived at the mountain in the midst of a more or less anti north pole
01-05-2020T15:28:43,SageSaga,so a south pole?
01-05-2020T15:28:56,TeapotOfDoom,yes :cteapotofdoom-florasmug:
01-05-2020T15:29:28,TeapotOfDoom,everything on the planet is cold but this region
01-05-2020T15:29:32,TeapotOfDoom,downside: fey
01-05-2020T15:33:43,SageSaga,ah it's a fey touched zone or a Fey realm overlap?
01-05-2020T15:34:29,TeapotOfDoom,i know there are fey portals. my patreon is one but we don't know much about it yet. i'm playing a warlock
01-05-2020T15:36:28,SageSaga,"warlocks be like ""hey- let's take a short rest!"""
01-05-2020T15:36:35,TeapotOfDoom,ye
01-05-2020T15:37:19,TeapotOfDoom,i'm being ghosted by my patreon atm because i lost a fight and tried to go after the sucker but the rest of the party refused so i had to follow
01-05-2020T15:38:08,TeapotOfDoom,we're on the way to a city which will be fun because i can finally use my shapechanging
01-05-2020T15:38:57,TeapotOfDoom,but first: mutated w0lf time

01-05-2020T16:53:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember Mark had a video showing his life - he eats that heat and eat room temperature beef stew and says it’s good and quick
01-05-2020T16:54:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"can’t say I care he says they’re probably garbage for you, it’s the only thing I’ve had today"
01-05-2020T16:55:08,Ordithus,beef stew is good though

01-05-2020T16:58:42,SpazztasticKiwi,all I know is I was boiling alive and I was getting tea if it killed me so I went to sonic
01-05-2020T16:58:49,SpazztasticKiwi,but they were out of green tea
01-05-2020T16:59:07,SpazztasticKiwi,but I got regular unsweet with strawberry
01-05-2020T16:59:39,CrRAR,nice
01-05-2020T17:00:10,SpazztasticKiwi,then there was the food - I wasn’t hungry after having a coke before and being hot but I grabbed the stew when ~everything else~ I went for was out
01-05-2020T17:00:27,SpazztasticKiwi,and now I’m cold again
01-05-2020T17:00:54,SpazztasticKiwi,you watch unus annus

01-05-2020T17:01:47,CrRAR,Pink... trombone. :thinking:
01-05-2020T17:01:56,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s an interactive diagram for what happens in the mouth and throat when you talk
01-05-2020T17:02:07,CrRAR,lol
01-05-2020T17:02:13,Ordithus,sounds educational
01-05-2020T17:02:24,CrRAR,Freaky throat flaps
01-05-2020T17:02:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark tried to get it to simulate “hello”.......he got “bwabwabwabwabwa”
01-05-2020T17:02:37,SpazztasticKiwi,almost choked on mah food
01-05-2020T17:03:02,Ordithus,weird flappy vibrating fleshy bits with hot air passing through
01-05-2020T17:03:17,CrRAR,Sounds like QWOP but for face maneuvers
01-05-2020T17:04:07,CrRAR,Also GameGrumps played a game like that where you had to “operate” a robot pretending to be a human.
01-05-2020T17:04:51,CrRAR,It’s just a horribly crude controller mapping to make it complete mayhem.
01-05-2020T17:05:54,CrRAR,Kind of like GuitarHero but for a robot imitating a human.

01-05-2020T17:10:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I must be tired
01-05-2020T17:11:54,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s like watching parents teach a baby words
01-05-2020T17:12:56,CrRAR,That’d be freaky if they built Furby like intelligence into the programming and eventually it began talking to you.
01-05-2020T17:13:16,CrRAR,That’s nightmare fuel really.
