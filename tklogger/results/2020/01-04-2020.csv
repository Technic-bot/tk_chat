01-04-2020T11:31:45,CrRAR,"Yeah, the type of stuff it had was like the nyancat page. Just unending insanity. xD"
01-04-2020T11:40:56,ThoseButterflys,god forbid that anyone with epilepsy looked at that page
01-04-2020T11:42:25,CrRAR,I remember there being some hilarious ones.

01-04-2020T15:27:22,Roughlandin,Annnnd now I can't get the thought of male Kat having the voice of 90s Keanu Reeves out of my head...
01-04-2020T15:46:07,Dadrobit,"Dang, seems like there's no April Fools page this year."
01-04-2020T16:00:44,Roughlandin,Could still be one this weekend. Though April 1st falling in the middle of the week would probably make it a little awkward. Plus with everything going in the world I imagine a lot of people aren't really in the mood for April Fools right now...
01-04-2020T16:02:20,tehbear,just caught the discussion about ytmnd. youre the man now dog. seems an appropriate label for sketch..
01-04-2020T16:03:27,tehbear,Rough: Woha
01-04-2020T16:04:50,Roughlandin,Kit: Tooootally!
01-04-2020T17:00:01,Dadrobit,"Nah, Tom if Tom doesn't get it posted on the first he just doesn't do it."
01-04-2020T17:00:30,Dadrobit,He did it one year where he continued the joke for a little bit and people lost their goddamned minds
01-04-2020T17:00:51,BadFoMo,Yep.
01-04-2020T17:01:00,Dadrobit,"My dude got thrown on the pyre for it, stopped doing them for a while."
01-04-2020T17:05:36,BadFoMo,"I was one of the haters (got caught up in the hate too due to my 'friend' liking that [that was one of the only times we really got along]). However, if he did have something and put a lot of work into it, I would be fine with it being a Voting Incentive."
01-04-2020T17:18:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I still fail to see what was so bad
01-04-2020T17:31:21,BadFoMo,I think I had three reasons: 1. He continued it past the one day. 2. He said it was no joke after the one day. 3. I feel that this was too soon after the Laura (maybe) Ghost arc.
01-04-2020T17:33:43,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
01-04-2020T17:48:47,SpazztasticKiwi,the idea that the characters aren’t real and all that’s effected is the existences of figments of their imaginations placed on them by a creation someone else made they chose to read and have effect them so deeply via their own actions never occurred to
01-04-2020T17:48:51,SpazztasticKiwi,them?
01-04-2020T17:56:15,ThoseButterflys,I think I get what your saying
01-04-2020T18:40:48,Roughlandin,"Not trying to dredge up a flame war, but... I still kind of like the idea of Alaric possessing Lynn. It feels like Tom went through a phase in the Basitin Isles arc of making really interesting characters and then murdering them horribly..."
01-04-2020T18:41:39,Roughlandin,"I wish we'd had like, at least another chapter of Alaric and Laura. But hey, that's how you know you've wrote good characters!"

01-04-2020T23:34:41,Ordithus,got an add for reese's with that
01-04-2020T23:36:11,SpazztasticKiwi,kids are one of the most irrational fascinating things to watch at work
01-04-2020T23:36:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"I saw twin girls shopping with dad once, one wanted to hold what dad was putting in the cart but when he put it in the cart instead of her hand, her day was ruined"
01-04-2020T23:37:22,BlackjackSec99,^ yep that happens
01-04-2020T23:38:38,SpazztasticKiwi,had a little girl also point at me and say “mommy”
01-04-2020T23:38:57,AspiringNoodle,Humans as a species are hyper intelligent
01-04-2020T23:39:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"not in this universe, kid - I would’ve noticed"
01-04-2020T23:39:12,AspiringNoodle,Humans as children are nothing more than animals with unique skills :P
01-04-2020T23:40:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"a few years ago I was leaving the library - some kids event was going on, so other cars were rolling by to pick up kids while others were leaving with their kids"
01-04-2020T23:41:06,SpazztasticKiwi,one boy was standing outside the door looking around very obviously lost
01-04-2020T23:41:19,SpazztasticKiwi,he tell me “I can’t find my mommy”
01-04-2020T23:41:42,SpazztasticKiwi,my first thought was some lady had managed to leave without her kid
01-04-2020T23:42:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"but I asked him what her name was and walked him back in the building because we were next to a ~busy road~ and yelled this chicks name inside, shutting the noise down for a moment"
01-04-2020T23:42:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"one head popped up, and he ran on over"
01-04-2020T23:43:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"I hope that woman realized that he had wondered outside, during a busy hour, near a busy road that was close to a highway"
01-04-2020T23:43:53,SpazztasticKiwi,and she clearly hadn’t noticed him walk off
01-04-2020T23:44:12,BlackjackSec99,having kids is scary like that... they can ninja off at any moment
01-04-2020T23:45:01,Ordithus,I swear kids are programmed to find the most dangerous thing to do any moment they are left unsupervised for 5 seconds
01-04-2020T23:45:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’ve seen parents literally dragging kids into the store by the hand because they don’t want to hold mommy or daddy’s hand but dammit, mommy/daddy was going to keep a death grip on that hand till they crossed the parking lot"
01-04-2020T23:46:13,BlackjackSec99,"yep, done that too..."
01-04-2020T23:47:21,Ordithus,":ptv-sleepy: I sleepy, get sleep now.  Good night"

01-04-2020T23:47:50,SpazztasticKiwi,don’t wake grandpa
01-04-2020T23:48:22,AspiringNoodle,Huh... neat.  Just learned something interesting
01-04-2020T23:48:33,AspiringNoodle,Apparently hazard pay can't exceed 25% of base pay
01-04-2020T23:49:03,BlackjackSec99,cant?
01-04-2020T23:49:12,BlackjackSec99,the hell?
01-04-2020T23:53:50,AspiringNoodle,Not sure why
01-04-2020T23:54:02,AspiringNoodle,Probably to prevent worker exploitation
01-04-2020T23:54:15,BlackjackSec99,"During the Battle of Osowiec Fortress in 1915, German Field Marshal Paul Von Hindenburg ordered the bombardment of the fortress with an artillery barrage of chlorine gas to eradicate the 900 Russian defenders."
01-04-2020T23:54:22,BlackjackSec99,"After the bombardment 7,000 German soldiers advanced upon the fortress expecting little to no resistance when 100 disfigured Russians, coughing up blood and pieces of their own lungs, surprised the Germans with a counter-charge."
01-04-2020T23:54:30,BlackjackSec99,The zombie-like Russians opened fire and attacked the Germans with affixed bayonets causing mass panic and forced the Germans to flee back into their own traps inflicting more casualties
01-04-2020T23:54:37,BlackjackSec99,The remaining Russian defenders who survived the gas attacks seized the opportunity to raze the fortress and withdraw while the Germans hesitated.
01-04-2020T23:54:46,BlackjackSec99,"""The Attack of the Dead Men"" spawned German legends about unkillable Russian soldiers rising from the dead to fight."
