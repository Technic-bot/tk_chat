06-09-2020T03:19:42,RimaDraws,ive managed to find red contacts for my clovis cosplay
06-09-2020T03:23:25,Dadrobit,Oh? Do you have any pictures of the cosplay on your Twitter or something?
06-09-2020T03:42:17,RimaDraws,i haven't started yet but i want to have her ready by next year
06-09-2020T03:42:23,RimaDraws,she's gonna cost me alot
06-09-2020T03:43:05,RimaDraws,i wanted sclera lenses but i cant find any with yellow sclera and red eyes
06-09-2020T03:45:06,Dadrobit,"Alas, no contact lenses for my cosplays."
06-09-2020T03:45:23,RimaDraws,yea i wanted freaking yellow sclera lenses but they have none
06-09-2020T03:45:26,Dadrobit,Too much anxiety with things being close to my eyes
06-09-2020T03:46:04,Dadrobit,I commend you on your commitment to the details though
06-09-2020T03:46:07,RimaDraws,i plan on doing clovis and a few others. clovis will have two different versions human and keidran if i can get the materials for keidran
06-09-2020T03:46:28,RimaDraws,well since clovis has an official outfit reveal all i need to do is make a top for the pants
06-09-2020T03:46:31,RimaDraws,i love black and red
06-09-2020T03:49:44,RimaDraws,at first i was debating on what to do for clothing since in dragon masquerade he didnt have clothes. but now that he does i have a full plan
06-09-2020T03:51:06,Dadrobit,"Yeah, no clothes would be problematic in.... Most places."
06-09-2020T03:51:43,Dadrobit,"Unless you went full Monty and got a fursuit, but no human version there."
06-09-2020T04:00:05,RimaDraws,heck no
06-09-2020T04:00:15,RimaDraws,i can't afford a fursuit and the one i saw for raine was terrifying
06-09-2020T04:00:24,RimaDraws,no fursuits
06-09-2020T04:10:34,RimaDraws,i have alot planned out just need the money to do so
06-09-2020T04:13:58,Dadrobit,"""I have a lot planned out, just need the money to do so"" is like 97% of living."
06-09-2020T04:14:35,RimaDraws,right now i am working on alot of fnaf content and finishing up some revamps and old cosplays ive done.
