06-04-2020T10:39:59,CrimsonQuill,@TerraTheWizard Doot
06-04-2020T10:42:36,KeefMcDerpface,Whatever squirrels live out here.
06-04-2020T10:42:52,CrimsonQuill,Red? Grey?
06-04-2020T10:43:02,KeefMcDerpface,Brown?
06-04-2020T10:45:27,CrimsonQuill,Red then
06-04-2020T10:45:33,CrimsonQuill,Red squirrels have brownish red fur
06-04-2020T10:45:46,CrimsonQuill,So lots of Mr and Mrs Nibblies
06-04-2020T10:45:51,KeefMcDerpface,Okay
06-04-2020T10:45:54,KeefMcDerpface,yep
06-04-2020T10:46:14,KeefMcDerpface,I refer to every squirrel I see as Mrs. and Mr. Nibbly.
06-04-2020T10:47:01,CrimsonQuill,XD
06-04-2020T10:47:15,CrimsonQuill,I had to restart my Spartan portrait today
06-04-2020T10:47:32,CrimsonQuill,While inking in Raine's Armour and Helmet I...kind of ruined the armour.
06-04-2020T10:47:43,CrimsonQuill,I'm a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to that.
06-04-2020T10:47:44,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-shock:
06-04-2020T10:47:54,CrimsonQuill,The Air Assault helmet was squashed.
06-04-2020T10:47:58,KeefMcDerpface,The inking ... RUINED!
06-04-2020T10:48:06,CrimsonQuill,The Chestplate was out of whack.
06-04-2020T10:48:15,CrimsonQuill,The Sniper rifle was a bit too short.
06-04-2020T10:48:23,CrimsonQuill,And her combat knife was at the wrong angle.
06-04-2020T10:48:29,CrimsonQuill,So I started again.
06-04-2020T10:48:52,CrimsonQuill,It's kinda weird-first time I've actually drawn Raine better than I drew her armor. X
06-04-2020T10:48:53,CrimsonQuill,XD
06-04-2020T10:49:24,CrimsonQuill,I need a ton of reference pics to draw Halo armor
06-04-2020T10:50:06,ThoseButterflys,send the link when you have finished

06-04-2020T10:50:49,CrimsonQuill,Thomas and Luke looking Snazzy and Badass in their Gen2 armors
06-04-2020T10:51:21,CrimsonQuill,A Halo 3d Artist named AscendHyperion actually kitbashed and rendered Bailey for me (On commission)
06-04-2020T10:51:38,CrimsonQuill,It really helps draw it. There are 9 different sets used to make it!

06-04-2020T12:04:13,JojoF2415,I wasted 1 hour watching dance till your dead

06-04-2020T12:06:03,CrimsonQuill,I see
06-04-2020T12:06:06,CrimsonQuill,I use colour pencils
06-04-2020T12:06:16,CrimsonQuill,I'm trying to make metallic effects on the armor
06-04-2020T12:06:22,JojoF2415,I use color pencil sometimes
06-04-2020T12:06:50,CrimsonQuill,How long have you been drawing?
06-04-2020T12:07:07,JojoF2415,Less than 4 years
06-04-2020T12:07:21,CrimsonQuill,Wow!
06-04-2020T12:07:34,CrimsonQuill,That's a steep learning curve.

06-04-2020T12:08:30,CrimsonQuill,Although
06-04-2020T12:08:40,CrimsonQuill,I'm a lot...slower. And more of a procrastinator
06-04-2020T12:09:06,CrimsonQuill,I only started seriously last January after drawing that old pic of HoS Kessah as a Spartan
06-04-2020T12:09:10,JojoF2415,I took an art class but didn’t learn anything
06-04-2020T12:10:11,CrimsonQuill,Aheheh
06-04-2020T12:10:24,JojoF2415,Something to make everyone smile this morning
06-04-2020T12:10:26,CrimsonQuill,I met a few art students in the national gallery once who said the same thing

06-04-2020T18:49:47,CrRAR,...because someone else took them off he doesn't have to put them on?
06-04-2020T18:49:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"“we still need to do a last load, there’s supposed to be rounds until 6, and there’s only going to be a few put on”"
06-04-2020T18:50:25,AspiringNoodle,I had the opposite kind of argument with a coworker last week
06-04-2020T18:50:33,AspiringNoodle,I'm cleaning the store like we're supposed to every 2 hours
06-04-2020T18:50:40,SpazztasticKiwi,“but there was just some made”
06-04-2020T18:50:46,AspiringNoodle,And he's telling me to STOP sanitizing because other things need done
06-04-2020T18:50:51,AspiringNoodle,Can we swap? plz?
06-04-2020T18:51:00,CrRAR,lol
06-04-2020T18:51:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"“they take time to cook. we need a last round, it’s the rules”"
06-04-2020T18:51:17,SpazztasticKiwi,so finally he goes and gets chickens
06-04-2020T18:51:28,SpazztasticKiwi,brings them back and starts loading them on
06-04-2020T18:51:52,SpazztasticKiwi,side note: his mother in law to be works at our store

06-04-2020T18:52:50,JojoF2415,🐓
06-04-2020T18:52:57,CrRAR,Ah I would have thought you would have threatened to find her and squeal on him.
06-04-2020T18:52:59,SpazztasticKiwi,after awhile I abandoned what I was doing and put them on
06-04-2020T18:53:17,K3IDRAN,"Hello,"
06-04-2020T18:53:22,CrRAR,helloooo
06-04-2020T18:53:33,SpazztasticKiwi,the spool came loose so I then had to take all the chickens and racks off to fix that
06-04-2020T18:53:58,SpazztasticKiwi,and I wiped off the mess and started them
06-04-2020T18:54:40,CrRAR,Spazz the real MVP
06-04-2020T18:54:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I wanted to smack him

06-04-2020T18:55:22,AspiringNoodle,Also me: *huge sigh* *starts cleaning*
06-04-2020T18:55:42,SpazztasticKiwi,you especially DO NOT walk off from working with raw chickens and leave them wide open on the floor
06-04-2020T18:56:04,CrRAR,"yeah no, don't leave anything raw out"
06-04-2020T18:56:07,CrRAR,bad end

06-04-2020T18:58:53,AspiringNoodle,"And it's like, I'm focusing on the customer.  If I start holding a conversation with you, it'd be kinda rude"

06-04-2020T18:59:36,AspiringNoodle,"But for the most part, they can talk and keep doing w/e it was they were doing"
06-04-2020T18:59:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"he’s not as bad as the Star Wars guy we had, but he’ll talk your ears off"

06-04-2020T19:17:10,Ordithus,have you tried whispering louder
06-04-2020T19:17:21,CrRAR,or... quieter
06-04-2020T19:18:04,CrRAR,"Is that rice in the middle ord, or a whole bowl of salt"

06-04-2020T19:19:52,CrRAR,Tobasco is actually common on eggies
06-04-2020T19:19:59,SpazztasticKiwi,you’re a bunch of disappointments
06-04-2020T19:20:05,CrRAR,That's why breakfast places will have it out
06-04-2020T19:20:09,Ordithus,because we enjoy flavor?

06-04-2020T19:20:48,Ordithus,I love a good huevos rancheros with some tobasco

06-04-2020T19:21:55,CrRAR,quality breakfast
06-04-2020T19:22:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I agree with Amy - the eggs need to be crispier
06-04-2020T19:22:24,CrRAR,Are they sunnyside?
06-04-2020T19:22:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"the way he makes them, they’re completely soft all around"
06-04-2020T19:22:33,CrRAR,I do over easy most times or scrambled
06-04-2020T19:22:54,SpazztasticKiwi,he put em in a sauce pan with water and set a lid on it
06-04-2020T19:22:57,CrRAR,Some people make them in those little cylinders so it comes out like a mcmuffin
06-04-2020T19:23:04,CrRAR,ohhh
06-04-2020T19:23:06,Ordithus,over easy and make a sammich

06-04-2020T19:24:41,SpazztasticKiwi,and butter

06-04-2020T19:27:43,SpazztasticKiwi,much like the stream where he came back from a bathroom break and he saw that ~one question~ in chat about washing his hands
06-04-2020T19:29:47,CrRAR,Chats never fail to amaze
06-04-2020T19:30:46,SpazztasticKiwi,he went on a tangent for something close to twenty minutes

06-04-2020T19:36:05,CrRAR,By the end was he bequeathed an honorary mustache?
06-04-2020T19:36:25,CrRAR,"""You have proved yourself worthyyy"""
06-04-2020T19:36:35,CrRAR,or did he fail miserably?
