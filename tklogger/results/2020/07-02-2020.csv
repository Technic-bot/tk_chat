07-02-2020T00:07:30,iliar,Tom draws Weeping Rose?! Nice! I remember Marshall had additional wishes for this art. It is very interesting to see how the result will look.
07-02-2020T00:07:48,AkelaStormclaw,Ever wonder if Trace ever did Nora.......
07-02-2020T00:07:58,CrRAR,lol
07-02-2020T00:07:59,KeefMcDerpface,?

07-02-2020T00:08:10,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:
07-02-2020T00:08:19,AkelaStormclaw,Well it's sorta implied.
07-02-2020T00:08:50,CrRAR,tis true
07-02-2020T00:09:15,KeefMcDerpface,We have a lot of sketches with that gag. And Trace seems uninterested.
07-02-2020T00:10:49,CrRAR,"the ""quite...personally"" quote might be what Akela is referencing."
07-02-2020T00:11:36,unsteddyphoenix,cute giant girl nero
07-02-2020T00:11:53,AkelaStormclaw,Exactly. Also the thing that Nora keeps Rani form seeing in Trace's memories.
07-02-2020T00:12:04,unsteddyphoenix,:OOO
07-02-2020T00:12:05,Roughlandin,"I mean the girl who can have everybody meeting the one guy she can't have is kind of the whole joke. If she got him, it sort of defeats the joke"
07-02-2020T00:12:10,unsteddyphoenix,n-no u
07-02-2020T00:12:42,Roughlandin,Also Trace's memories involve a lot of murder and other general horribleness
07-02-2020T00:12:48,Nekonny,"ok, I think I'm done for the night"
07-02-2020T00:12:56,CrRAR,alrighty

07-02-2020T00:13:48,Panko,Thanks for the streams
07-02-2020T00:14:14,AkelaStormclaw,Wait is that Trace's wife?
07-02-2020T00:14:19,CrRAR,yup
07-02-2020T00:14:20,KeefMcDerpface,Yes
07-02-2020T00:14:26,AkelaStormclaw,*the plot thickens*
07-02-2020T00:14:32,SageSaga,. . .
07-02-2020T00:14:37,CrRAR,haha
07-02-2020T00:14:39,RedGoose,Such a somber photo
07-02-2020T00:14:45,SageSaga,you should read the comic i guess?
07-02-2020T00:14:47,KeefMcDerpface,This is after her death.
07-02-2020T00:14:51,tinywitchdraws,brb
07-02-2020T00:14:58,AkelaStormclaw,I have. All of it.
07-02-2020T00:15:05,SageSaga,this shouldnt be new to you then
07-02-2020T00:15:06,KeefMcDerpface,"So, a joke?"
07-02-2020T00:15:12,AkelaStormclaw,Indeed.
07-02-2020T00:15:38,CrRAR,"They have history, Rose was Saria's, saria also saved her from Euchre's dishonesty"
07-02-2020T00:16:25,AkelaStormclaw,"Granted, I read it while I was down with a horrible migrane, so some minor details probably slipped my mind."
07-02-2020T00:16:43,KeefMcDerpface,like her death?
07-02-2020T00:16:47,CrRAR,They were very close
07-02-2020T00:17:51,RedGoose,^
07-02-2020T00:17:51,Roughlandin,Trace was away a lot... and also a huge jerk at the time. They honestly probably had a closer relationship than Saria did with Trace
07-02-2020T00:18:12,CrRAR,yis
07-02-2020T00:18:31,KeefMcDerpface,I wouldn't consider him a HUGE jerk but I see what you mean.
07-02-2020T00:19:17,KeefMcDerpface,More of a guy who screws up a bit.
07-02-2020T00:19:58,ShamusTheFox,I wonder if Rose partially blames herself for not picking up on the signs that the wound was poisoned.
07-02-2020T00:20:02,Roughlandin,Well at the time he was a huge racist... Also a slave owner.
07-02-2020T00:20:07,Roughlandin,Kinda jerky
07-02-2020T00:20:15,KeefMcDerpface,But not huge
07-02-2020T00:20:16,Ordithus,The kind of guy who fights dragons to impress a lady
07-02-2020T00:20:27,AkelaStormclaw,Yeah.
07-02-2020T00:20:27,CrRAR,haha
07-02-2020T00:20:34,Ordithus,Rose was halfway across the continent
07-02-2020T00:20:39,RedGoose,Have we yet to see the full dark side of trace?
07-02-2020T00:20:52,ShamusTheFox,Was she? It's been a while.
07-02-2020T00:21:07,Roughlandin,Well after Saria died he kinda killed... like... a BUNCH of people
07-02-2020T00:21:14,KeefMcDerpface,^
07-02-2020T00:21:15,CrRAR,that one panel Laura witnessed when he slaughtered a village
07-02-2020T00:21:18,Roughlandin,That was pretty dark
07-02-2020T00:21:39,CrRAR,don't forget the death ribbons he used on the Basitins!
07-02-2020T00:21:42,Ordithus,Also when he killed those Templar students
07-02-2020T00:21:54,Roughlandin,Like I said... lotta murder
07-02-2020T00:22:22,AkelaStormclaw,Wot death ribbons?
07-02-2020T00:22:43,CrRAR,He killed the Basitin guards and used them as shields
07-02-2020T00:22:57,ShamusTheFox,"Well, to be fair, some of that was also a result of people trying to murder him, but it was probably total bloodlust either way."
07-02-2020T00:23:04,CrRAR,yeah
07-02-2020T00:23:17,CrRAR,ooo Ghost Saria?
07-02-2020T00:23:20,Ordithus,These http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/513/
07-02-2020T00:23:21,KeefMcDerpface,"Oh, the black tentacles."
07-02-2020T00:23:31,CrRAR,"She like ""Nooo, don't cri"""

07-02-2020T00:23:57,KeefMcDerpface,"oh, she really is there."
07-02-2020T00:24:01,KeefMcDerpface,As a ghost.
07-02-2020T00:24:11,AkelaStormclaw,I think it's evil smoke shadow's real form. The tentacle guy.
07-02-2020T00:24:21,RedGoose,The silence of this photo is deafening
07-02-2020T00:24:32,CrRAR,"tentacle man, with the tentacle plan~"
07-02-2020T00:24:43,CrRAR,:squid:
07-02-2020T00:24:58,KeefMcDerpface,plays unsettling music.
07-02-2020T00:25:01,Twokinds,brb
07-02-2020T00:25:05,CrRAR,okay
07-02-2020T00:25:10,Roughlandin,Also we recently learned his whole relationship with Maren was just because she looks kind of like Saria and he wants to use her body to resurrect her... Which will probably kill Maren.
07-02-2020T00:25:20,Roughlandin,Also kinda jerky
07-02-2020T00:25:35,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-eyeroll:*[What a drag]
07-02-2020T00:25:38,Roughlandin,Yeh
07-02-2020T00:25:42,Ordithus,If Trace kills Maren I'm gonna be very cross with him
07-02-2020T00:25:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,No killing Raine's waifu
07-02-2020T00:26:00,Roughlandin,She won't die.
07-02-2020T00:26:03,Roughlandin,Probably
07-02-2020T00:26:05,Roughlandin,Maybe
07-02-2020T00:26:08,Roughlandin,I hope
07-02-2020T00:26:16,ShamusTheFox,"Well, Trace may not have a choice in the matter, it might be the house's will."
07-02-2020T00:26:19,Ordithus,"Exactly, Marv"
07-02-2020T00:26:32,CrRAR,"If Maren becomes the house though, she'll make sure so many guilty people stub their toes."
07-02-2020T00:26:32,Roughlandin,Eh. The house does Old Trace's will
07-02-2020T00:26:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I need her alive incase my main plan fails
07-02-2020T00:26:38,ShamusTheFox,Or whatever Trace put in there...
07-02-2020T00:26:41,Roughlandin,That's kind of how he made it
07-02-2020T00:26:45,Ordithus,haha

07-02-2020T00:31:36,Roughlandin,Blatant copyright infringment apparently
07-02-2020T00:31:58,Roughlandin,Not copyright infringing if we all cross our fingers first
07-02-2020T00:32:23,CrRAR,:fingers_crossed:
07-02-2020T00:32:27,SageSaga,it technically is copyright infringement or another law based on broadcasting without a licence
07-02-2020T00:32:58,Roughlandin,Disney just fined school children 250USD for watching the Lion King wrong
07-02-2020T00:33:11,SageSaga,they  got off easy then

07-02-2020T00:41:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Lucky
07-02-2020T00:42:00,Ordithus,"Nice work, Sage"
07-02-2020T00:42:11,AspiringNoodle,Nyna best little spoon
07-02-2020T00:42:23,Ordithus,"That is Nami, Noodle"
07-02-2020T00:42:35,AnuSekaniArt,Very cute spoon X3
07-02-2020T00:42:40,ZRO4825,"Can confirm, iz Nami."
07-02-2020T00:42:43,AspiringNoodle,The one in red?
07-02-2020T00:42:51,Ordithus,The one in red is Blue
07-02-2020T00:42:58,Ordithus,Um... that's not confusing at all
07-02-2020T00:43:06,AspiringNoodle,@_@
07-02-2020T00:43:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Blue is red, Nami is green"
07-02-2020T00:43:16,AspiringNoodle,Must read source material
07-02-2020T00:43:18,Ordithus,"No, Blue is blue"
07-02-2020T00:43:24,AspiringNoodle,"effin' hell, lol"
07-02-2020T00:43:46,SageSaga,Blue has blue hair and is wearing red in this picture
07-02-2020T00:43:54,AspiringNoodle,"I hereby dub them ""Catgirl 1"" and ""Catgirl 2"" xD"
07-02-2020T00:43:54,SageSaga,her real name is Jen
07-02-2020T00:44:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,No thats to descriptive
07-02-2020T00:44:01,SageSaga,but they call her Blue
07-02-2020T00:44:17,SageSaga,Nami is an android
07-02-2020T00:44:31,AspiringNoodle,"Oh right, bleh"
07-02-2020T00:44:48,SageSaga,this is Nyna
07-02-2020T00:44:56,AspiringNoodle,"Forgive me, I am sleep deprived and high on caffeine"
07-02-2020T00:45:01,Ordithus,Indeed <3
07-02-2020T00:45:18,AspiringNoodle,I should've realized that was Nami because she doesn't have the furry doodads on her arms / legs
07-02-2020T00:45:29,AspiringNoodle,Big giveaway >_>
07-02-2020T00:45:31,Ordithus,:csagesaga-c4: booty
07-02-2020T00:45:49,SageSaga,"nyna also has much smaller tits, is shorter and has yellow eyes"
07-02-2020T00:45:54,ZRO4825,That was a good picture.
07-02-2020T00:45:59,AspiringNoodle,But she got das booty
07-02-2020T00:46:01,Ordithus,And a forked tail
07-02-2020T00:46:02,SageSaga,and her tail is a split tail
07-02-2020T00:46:36,Ordithus,Nyna is also considerably more dangerous
07-02-2020T00:46:54,AspiringNoodle,But would she make better little spoon?
07-02-2020T00:46:57,AspiringNoodle,Yes. Yes she would.
07-02-2020T00:47:03,Ordithus,Nyna is the big spoon
07-02-2020T00:47:20,SageSaga,Nyna is Dom
07-02-2020T00:47:51,AspiringNoodle,But... you can't enjoy the booty if she's behind you!
07-02-2020T00:48:09,SageSaga,you only get to enjoy the booty if she lets you
07-02-2020T00:48:42,AspiringNoodle,...okay :ptv-uneasy:
07-02-2020T00:49:26,ZRO4825,"Actually, if Nami cranks the output and turns off the limiters...which one actually *is* stronger, I wonder? :thinking:"
07-02-2020T00:49:38,SageSaga,Nyna
07-02-2020T00:50:13,ZRO4825,Well there ya go~
07-02-2020T00:50:20,Ordithus,:csagesaga-nynasmirk:
07-02-2020T00:50:26,ZRO4825,What if it's Lien? Since she's that actual combat model? :o
07-02-2020T00:50:33,ZRO4825,she's the*
07-02-2020T00:50:34,SageSaga,Nami has physical material limitations
07-02-2020T00:50:57,SageSaga,lien has a better shot but Nyna is still a tough one
07-02-2020T00:51:14,SageSaga,I would say Lien would win
07-02-2020T00:51:31,SageSaga,based on combat experience and not raw power
07-02-2020T00:51:36,ZRO4825,Fair point~
07-02-2020T00:51:38,Ordithus,So Phil still trumps all
07-02-2020T00:51:47,Ordithus,Especially since Nyna uses magic
07-02-2020T00:51:54,AspiringNoodle,Someone get Death Battle on this
07-02-2020T00:51:56,ZRO4825,Nyna's not near as good as she thinks she is from what you've shown so far. Strong. But not exactly well experienced.
07-02-2020T00:51:56,AspiringNoodle,:P
07-02-2020T00:52:23,AspiringNoodle,"If there's one thing I've learned... is that when trying to power scale characters, the real world physics gets RIDONKULOUS"
07-02-2020T00:52:29,ZRO4825,"Pretty sure Kaylin wins the ""OP Battle Monster"" award though, lol"
07-02-2020T00:52:36,SageSaga,her people in general dont fight all that much with strong opponents - just spar within their own village and others
07-02-2020T00:52:59,SageSaga,Kaylin beats Lien in terms of Combat Expertise but not raw strength
07-02-2020T00:53:19,SageSaga,Kaylin is strong- but shes not robot strong or magic enhanced strong
07-02-2020T00:53:28,Ordithus,Hard to beat an RPG character for experience in slaying
07-02-2020T00:53:38,AspiringNoodle,DB got this covered :P
07-02-2020T00:53:40,Ordithus,Lien would have to commit unspeakable acts to keep up
07-02-2020T00:53:55,SageSaga,but Kaylin has over 100 years experience in combat as an Elven Ranger - not the class- the profession
07-02-2020T00:54:01,AspiringNoodle,"Strength, Durability, Versatility, Strategy"
07-02-2020T00:54:20,ZRO4825,Experience levels can trump pure numbers. :3
07-02-2020T00:54:37,AspiringNoodle,"That said, sometimes a foe is so tough that unless you have a suitable way to off them, you could be a veteran and still lose"
07-02-2020T00:54:50,unsteddyphoenix,How many confirmed kills does kaylin have
07-02-2020T00:55:18,Ordithus,:csagesaga-kaylinheart:
07-02-2020T00:55:18,SageSaga,thousands
07-02-2020T00:55:25,Twokinds,2
07-02-2020T00:55:41,AspiringNoodle,I believe the tigress in the hat
07-02-2020T00:55:46,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-hearts:
07-02-2020T00:57:06,unsteddyphoenix,Only 2 confirmed I guess
07-02-2020T00:57:53,Ordithus,The barghest and the leader of the gang spring to mind
07-02-2020T00:59:18,Ordithus,OH and this thing https://www.artificialincident.com/comic/the-ivory-forest-17/
07-02-2020T00:59:21,Ordithus,So at least 3
07-02-2020T00:59:23,unsteddyphoenix,That's 2!
07-02-2020T00:59:27,AspiringNoodle,ONLY
07-02-2020T00:59:28,AspiringNoodle,2
07-02-2020T01:00:04,SageSaga,. . .
07-02-2020T01:00:10,SageSaga,y'all are bad at math
07-02-2020T01:00:21,AspiringNoodle,But... 2 is better than one
07-02-2020T01:00:27,AspiringNoodle,It MUST be right!
07-02-2020T01:00:44,SageSaga,thats 3 but your missing all the other ones-
07-02-2020T01:01:07,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, that page is good~"
07-02-2020T01:01:18,AspiringNoodle,"I like the humor, and now I really MUST read the comic <3"
07-02-2020T01:01:34,SageSaga,https://www.artificialincident.com/comic/blood-claw-bandits-13/
07-02-2020T01:01:55,Ordithus,Not necessarily dead from what the audience saw :P

07-02-2020T01:02:36,Mihari,The bandit fainted!
07-02-2020T01:03:04,Twokinds,They're sleeping
07-02-2020T01:03:18,Ordithus,Technically the blood claw leader killed himself
07-02-2020T01:05:59,unsteddyphoenix,So its less than one?
07-02-2020T01:07:32,AspiringNoodle,I swear
07-02-2020T01:07:40,AspiringNoodle,"We're going to give Phil an ulcer one of these days, lol"

07-02-2020T02:45:44,SageSaga,too bad I cant just take the recliner i have and put wheels on it to use at my desk
07-02-2020T02:46:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Maaan, I want that now."
07-02-2020T02:48:38,SageSaga,office chairs just dont have the kinda comfort and padding a recliner has
07-02-2020T02:51:13,Ordithus,"high end chairs are comfy, but $$$"
07-02-2020T02:52:48,SageSaga,im willing to pay up to 300 dollars
07-02-2020T02:53:15,SageSaga,but i expect a 6-10 year warranty
07-02-2020T02:55:37,Ordithus,I'll pick my mom's mind.  she used to sell the stuff
07-02-2020T03:00:28,SageSaga,dang it
07-02-2020T03:00:35,SageSaga,this chair is a thousand dollars
07-02-2020T03:00:48,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-adiracoin:
07-02-2020T03:02:03,unsteddyphoenix,hmm slightly above budget
07-02-2020T03:02:11,henner,yo
07-02-2020T03:02:29,SageSaga,yo
07-02-2020T03:02:54,henner,heh i hardly ever have time to stick around for these streams
07-02-2020T03:03:01,henner,sometimes i do tho
07-02-2020T03:03:46,SageSaga,yeah they can run pretty long
07-02-2020T03:07:15,AspiringNoodle,"Guys, I made a mistake..."
07-02-2020T03:07:20,AspiringNoodle,I typed /played in WoW
07-02-2020T03:07:26,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-whiny:
07-02-2020T03:07:35,henner,lol
07-02-2020T03:07:39,henner,how long?
07-02-2020T03:07:45,henner,and on ur main?
07-02-2020T03:08:18,henner,i cant remember but i think applekrisp has like 24 days played
07-02-2020T03:08:36,henner,*my main 120 worgen mm hunter
07-02-2020T03:08:50,henner,i aint subbed rn tho
07-02-2020T03:08:56,AspiringNoodle,My current main for the expansion is at almost 42 days
07-02-2020T03:09:10,henner,wow
07-02-2020T03:09:25,henner,thats quite a while
07-02-2020T03:09:32,AspiringNoodle,What I want to know now is how much of that was afk time
07-02-2020T03:09:33,SageSaga,that doesnt seem that impressive
07-02-2020T03:10:01,henner,"although id imagine that could be achieved by at least playing a couple hours daily, in my book that is average"
07-02-2020T03:10:38,henner,i dont play much
07-02-2020T03:10:56,AspiringNoodle,"Well, 42 days would equate to about 1000 hours"
07-02-2020T03:11:11,henner,it used to be where id only play through like november to febuary then unsub
07-02-2020T03:11:12,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:
07-02-2020T03:11:24,AspiringNoodle,"I also just nuked a bunch of my toons that I don't hold love for anymore, so those /played stats are gone"
07-02-2020T03:11:59,AspiringNoodle,My hunter from last expansion broke 70 days
07-02-2020T03:12:34,SageSaga,"ord- the answer to ""What is the return policy"" on that is ""It's just called Regret"""
07-02-2020T03:12:37,AspiringNoodle,My paladin has 107 days
07-02-2020T03:12:45,Ordithus,lol
07-02-2020T03:12:56,henner,"but 2019 i tried playing as my main game full time, it was fun, but eventually i found myself not really immersed cuz i was looking at action bars instead of who im trying to shoot"
07-02-2020T03:13:13,AspiringNoodle,Monk is 54 days
07-02-2020T03:13:15,Ordithus,I have one of these myself https://www.hon.com/chairs/volt/h5713 (you can get these at way less than MSRP)
07-02-2020T03:13:38,AspiringNoodle,And my druid is 90 days
07-02-2020T03:14:01,AspiringNoodle,"...I dread to think of the amount of time I sunk into my mage, priest, warlock, and DK ;_;"
07-02-2020T03:15:34,SageSaga,those chairs dont look that comfortable for someone like me who works 6-12 hours a day at a desk
07-02-2020T03:15:58,AspiringNoodle,Mesh chairs can be pretty comfortable
07-02-2020T03:16:27,SageSaga,not usually for extended periods- they tend to break down fast
07-02-2020T03:16:30,AspiringNoodle,"Ofc, the one I sat in didn't really work because I'm too fat, lol"
07-02-2020T03:16:35,Ordithus,I like mine but I do NOT sit at my desk nearly that long
07-02-2020T03:17:22,SageSaga,ive im not working that long im gaming for the extra 2-4 hours afterwards in the same chair
07-02-2020T03:17:54,SageSaga,the chair is almost as important as my bed because its used for recreation and work
07-02-2020T03:18:23,Ordithus,definitely
07-02-2020T03:18:43,SageSaga,too bad I cant buy another bed- cut it to the shape of a chair and attach wheel legs to it-
07-02-2020T03:18:48,Ordithus,haha
07-02-2020T03:18:59,Ordithus,if you did it'd be more than $300
07-02-2020T03:19:13,ZRO4825,I had a Lazy-boy computer chair at one point. Was damned comfortable. Unfortunately it wore out after I think only 4 or 5 years.
07-02-2020T03:20:35,AspiringNoodle,I use chairs until they break
07-02-2020T03:20:43,AspiringNoodle,Last one had completely destroyed the plywood base
07-02-2020T03:20:55,AspiringNoodle,"This one, the cushion is near nonexistent so I bought a cushion to put on top :D"
07-02-2020T03:21:43,SageSaga,my mattress wasnt very expensive
07-02-2020T03:22:06,henner,yo
07-02-2020T03:22:06,SageSaga,but yeah
07-02-2020T03:22:07,henner,yo
07-02-2020T03:22:11,henner,bro...
07-02-2020T03:22:19,AspiringNoodle,Oh no
07-02-2020T03:22:25,henner,wanna know what i find interesting?
07-02-2020T03:22:29,henner,like....
07-02-2020T03:23:06,henner,world of warcraft has been brought up after the twokinds stream every week since i been following
07-02-2020T03:23:12,henner,its a pattern.....
07-02-2020T03:23:16,henner,like....
07-02-2020T03:23:21,henner,ive been seeing it
07-02-2020T03:23:25,henner,every week man
07-02-2020T03:23:28,Ordithus,Noodle is a pattern
07-02-2020T03:23:30,AspiringNoodle,^
07-02-2020T03:23:33,AspiringNoodle,:P
07-02-2020T03:23:36,henner,which brings me to this conclusion............
07-02-2020T03:23:46,AspiringNoodle,Fantasy is the ultimate genre~
07-02-2020T03:23:49,henner,twokinds = world of warcraft
07-02-2020T03:24:05,henner,think about it
07-02-2020T03:24:09,SageSaga,you are bad at conclusions
07-02-2020T03:24:21,AspiringNoodle,One of these days I'll stop bringing it up
07-02-2020T03:24:23,Ordithus,haha savage
07-02-2020T03:24:28,henner,you have human soldiers in BLUE silver and goldf armor
07-02-2020T03:24:30,henner,right?
07-02-2020T03:24:33,AspiringNoodle,Today I just shocked myself by getting a look at my played statistics
07-02-2020T03:24:41,henner,u got races of different people
07-02-2020T03:24:45,henner,they going to war
07-02-2020T03:24:54,henner,they got dragons that talk
07-02-2020T03:24:55,Ordithus,You just described Skyrim
07-02-2020T03:25:05,henner,its WoW man
07-02-2020T03:25:13,Ordithus,Or Lord of the Rings
07-02-2020T03:25:22,henner,theres literally simplified alliance soldiers in the game
07-02-2020T03:25:36,henner,they are also just as stupid as them too
07-02-2020T03:26:08,henner,which brings me to my next conclusion............
07-02-2020T03:26:13,SageSaga,yes- these are fantasy tropes- they are common in fantasy stories
07-02-2020T03:27:01,henner,*henner is away- AFK*
07-02-2020T03:27:20,DarthRexKing,Goodnight.
07-02-2020T03:27:34,henner,lol night guys
07-02-2020T03:30:19,DarthRexKing,"If Two Kinds is world of war craft, then I want to see Markiplier play that game and see how he reacts to it. Lol. :P Later."
07-02-2020T03:32:04,SageSaga,alright im done

07-02-2020T12:55:59,AspiringNoodle,Hiiiiii :ptv-hearts:
07-02-2020T12:56:07,JojoF2415,I was playing paper io yesterday
07-02-2020T12:56:28,JojoF2415,I died at 78%
07-02-2020T12:56:53,JojoF2415,I was getting mad because I would die above 50% after that
07-02-2020T12:56:58,AspiringNoodle,I love how Tom builds up the anticipation and hype for the proposal
07-02-2020T12:57:20,AspiringNoodle,"Then pulls the beach out from under us and goes ""Lol, that's not how I do things"""
07-02-2020T12:58:19,JojoF2415,It’s only been 6 months since I read Twokinds. I remember that day
07-02-2020T12:58:38,JojoF2415,I spent 9 hours shiny hunting Pokémon and nothing
07-02-2020T12:59:42,JojoF2415,How was the stream yesterday. I was so late because  I went out to eat
07-02-2020T12:59:50,AspiringNoodle,I think I may take a leave of absence from WoW tomorrow
07-02-2020T13:00:11,AspiringNoodle,Or at the very least play in moderation like a normal person
07-02-2020T13:00:29,JojoF2415,I finally used my computer for something else instead of homework
07-02-2020T13:00:31,AspiringNoodle,"Protip, never look at your play time for a game..."
07-02-2020T13:00:55,AspiringNoodle,"Also fun fact, 42 days of playtime equates to 1,008 hours :D"
07-02-2020T13:00:58,JojoF2415,I ignored that tip
07-02-2020T13:02:44,AspiringNoodle,Good thing I deleted some characters
07-02-2020T13:02:53,AspiringNoodle,"I dread to think of how many hours I actually have in this game, lol"
07-02-2020T13:14:21,Roughlandin,Just saw the new page lol. I wouldn't worry about Trace's ball drop. I'm guessing next weekend Flora is gonna show us how a proposal do

07-02-2020T15:03:52,SageSaga,"says Tom, king of emotes!"
07-02-2020T15:03:56,Twokinds,You just take a silly face and put it in a little box
07-02-2020T15:04:11,Twokinds,Maybe add some text or shaking
07-02-2020T15:05:24,DNMZ,Hello all
07-02-2020T15:05:36,JojoF2415,Hello
07-02-2020T15:08:17,DNMZ,I swear if in the last panel Kay reveals herself to Henry and says she is Cal's secret girlfriend I'm gonna die laughing. I seriously wonder how he'd react to that lol
07-02-2020T15:08:20,JojoF2415,Hi easy 62% - 100%
07-02-2020T15:09:39,SageSaga,why would she do that though? o_o
07-02-2020T15:10:21,DNMZ,"I know she wouldn't do that, just think it be super funny if she did hehe"
07-02-2020T15:10:27,SageSaga,"she's 1 - much older, 2 - not into little boys, 3 not into men at all, 4 - not a total creep o_o"
07-02-2020T15:11:16,DNMZ,"Ok, bye"
07-02-2020T15:11:23,SageSaga,o_O?
07-02-2020T15:12:27,SageSaga,I mean I agree it would be funny but it would kinda ruin the character if i actually did that
07-02-2020T15:12:45,SageSaga,and hes gone
07-02-2020T15:13:33,Ordithus,"""He's my father!"""
07-02-2020T15:13:42,Ordithus,:csagesaga-philhuh:
07-02-2020T15:13:54,SageSaga,jeez- you express concern for not having underage people in adult relationships and people get angry?
07-02-2020T15:16:21,Ordithus,I suspect Henry would not be amused
07-02-2020T15:16:45,SageSaga,Am I wrong though? Am I out of touch?
07-02-2020T15:19:30,Ordithus,"Probably on something, but not there"
07-02-2020T15:19:53,Sclimshady,"Nah, thats a fair stance Sage"
07-02-2020T15:20:42,SageSaga,then why do i get so much push back from people on it?
07-02-2020T15:21:20,Dakina,Yo
07-02-2020T15:21:21,Sclimshady,People are weird
07-02-2020T15:21:24,BadFoMo,Yo.
07-02-2020T15:21:29,Ordithus,Eh?  This has happened more than once?
07-02-2020T15:21:41,SageSaga,yeah thats like the 6th time
07-02-2020T15:21:52,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:
07-02-2020T15:22:12,Dakina,"Eh, people are weird and need something to whine about."
07-02-2020T15:22:22,SageSaga,why do all the vocal people want Kaylin to have sex with a 12 year old?
07-02-2020T15:22:57,Ordithus,Pretty sure DNMZ meant for her to say it as a complete joke
07-02-2020T15:23:59,BadFoMo,I talked about it because I heard that people thought that and I'm a Trolling *******.
07-02-2020T15:24:01,SageSaga,yeah but ive had 4 people say the exact same thing- and its like - ok guys- it was kinda funny but do you really want that to happen? Even though it makes no sense to go that way?
07-02-2020T15:25:44,SageSaga,=_=; i am at fault with some of this
07-02-2020T15:25:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve found there’s push back when the girl is older yeah
07-02-2020T15:26:02,SageSaga,my pain and lack of sleep has made me irritable
07-02-2020T15:26:17,SageSaga,so i push back way harder and i dont joke back enough
07-02-2020T15:26:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I was confronted with dating a fellow fan of Markiplier when I was still in hs
07-02-2020T15:26:38,Ordithus,No sleep is no good.
07-02-2020T15:26:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"the problem, besides me simply and utterly just not interested, is he was 14 and I’d turned 18"
07-02-2020T15:27:07,Ordithus,That's a hard pass
07-02-2020T15:27:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"people were blown away when I said no, neon, no thanks, not happening"
07-02-2020T15:27:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"yet if had been reversed, people wouldn’t lost their shit"
07-02-2020T15:27:37,SageSaga,its pretty easy for me to take a comment way too serious when im tired and hurting - thankfully the pain is mostly gone atm though - but im still really tired
07-02-2020T15:27:39,SpazztasticKiwi,would’ve
07-02-2020T15:28:15,BadFoMo,The pain going away is good.
07-02-2020T15:28:31,SageSaga,it'll come back- it always comes back
07-02-2020T15:29:03,SageSaga,im free for now though and thats what counts
07-02-2020T15:29:22,Ordithus,You're still no where near as grumpy as my nephew when he's tired :P
07-02-2020T15:29:53,Ordithus,Granted he's not quite 3...
07-02-2020T15:30:02,SageSaga,<_<;
07-02-2020T15:30:59,SageSaga,i also have a hard time thinking of this kinda stuff as a joke because so many people keep recommending it- it just doesnt feel like a joke anymore and it kinda worries me XD
07-02-2020T15:31:19,SageSaga,i know DNMZ was joking though
07-02-2020T15:31:37,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s concerning how many people are serious
07-02-2020T15:31:39,SageSaga,so im sorry about making a big deal over nothing
07-02-2020T15:32:20,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s not nothing if it bugs you
07-02-2020T15:33:14,Sclimshady,Id be irritated if someone insisted that to my stuff even once tbf
07-02-2020T15:33:18,SageSaga,jokes dont bug me much though- its not being able to tell if maybe this one is serious
07-02-2020T15:33:43,SageSaga,im better at assuming one is a joke if like- Tom suggested it - someone I know
07-02-2020T15:34:31,Ordithus,But Tom is the one with the comic that has a 24 year old proposing to an 11 :ctwokinds-traceflohug:

07-02-2020T15:57:11,SpazztasticKiwi,“self venting” it said
07-02-2020T15:57:49,SpazztasticKiwi,stick it in the microwave and hit a minute - fully expected it to go boom
07-02-2020T16:01:49,SageSaga,update?
07-02-2020T16:03:01,SageSaga,oh no- it exploded- Kiwi is dead now

07-02-2020T16:14:44,SageSaga,yo Crim
07-02-2020T16:14:49,CrimsonQuill,Hiya Sage
07-02-2020T16:15:07,CrimsonQuill,Guys...remember I said I was redrawing the Banhammer battle?
07-02-2020T16:15:09,SpazztasticKiwi,nah no boom
07-02-2020T16:15:13,CrimsonQuill,...I might have drawn it...
07-02-2020T16:15:30,SpazztasticKiwi,it did give out a concerning hiss while it was in there
07-02-2020T16:15:51,SageSaga,"we are morning Kiwi's death, it was so recent- i can still hear Kiwi's voice"
07-02-2020T16:16:24,SpazztasticKiwi,quit telling everybody I’m dead
07-02-2020T16:16:30,SageSaga,wait- ive never heard Kiwi's voice
07-02-2020T16:16:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I hope someone gets that reference
07-02-2020T16:16:42,SpazztasticKiwi,yes you have
07-02-2020T16:16:51,CrimsonQuill,Is confused and does not get the reference
07-02-2020T16:16:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"lann’s birthday stream, weren’t you there too"
07-02-2020T16:16:58,SageSaga,do you sound like a generic person?
07-02-2020T16:17:12,SageSaga,i was only there for a bit of the first half
07-02-2020T16:17:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I was there about that time
07-02-2020T16:17:33,SageSaga,i had an operation the next morning so i wasnt able to stay long
07-02-2020T16:18:14,SpazztasticKiwi,then again there’s so many people there who knows who’s voice was whose
07-02-2020T16:18:23,SpazztasticKiwi,kame said he liked my accent...
07-02-2020T16:18:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I sound a bit like a female Jeff Foxworthy..
07-02-2020T16:19:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don’t, for the record, like it"
07-02-2020T16:19:17,Ordithus,Few people like their own voice
07-02-2020T16:19:22,SageSaga,no one says they like my accent but some people have said they like my voice- but a lot of people have called me Miss and thats kinda weird
07-02-2020T16:20:35,SageSaga,"Miss, Ma'am and Darlin' are things im a bit thrown off by when people call me them"
07-02-2020T16:21:07,Ordithus,Yeah I bet
07-02-2020T16:21:12,SageSaga,"especially when they get angry when I tell them I was the person they spoke to on the phone and they say ""No I spoke to a woman!"""
07-02-2020T16:21:24,SpazztasticKiwi,you remind me slightly of Ethan N
07-02-2020T16:21:37,SageSaga,who is that?
07-02-2020T16:21:43,SpazztasticKiwi,crankgameplays
07-02-2020T16:22:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I also know people who have that kind of problem with their voice
07-02-2020T16:25:35,SpazztasticKiwi,you say “ice water” with my kind of accent it can come out as “ass water”
07-02-2020T16:28:32,Ordithus,Ew

07-02-2020T20:30:27,RimaDraws,watching unus annus
07-02-2020T20:31:12,Dadrobit,Not familiar with that?
07-02-2020T20:31:32,RimaDraws,unus annus is mark and ethans channel to do fun things for a year
07-02-2020T20:31:38,RimaDraws,and after a year they take it down
07-02-2020T20:31:43,RimaDraws,i am like caught up on it
07-02-2020T20:33:06,Dadrobit,Like video games or live action stuffs?
07-02-2020T20:33:10,RimaDraws,melanie martinez is a music artist
07-02-2020T20:33:16,RimaDraws,uh just silly stuff and sometimes good things
07-02-2020T20:33:21,RimaDraws,but mostly silly
07-02-2020T20:33:33,RimaDraws,not video games. its hard to describe unless you watch yourself
07-02-2020T20:34:21,Dadrobit,I'm thinking something along the lines of Game Grumps 10 minute power hour?
07-02-2020T20:34:21,RimaDraws,but i enjoy watching mark and ethan. they are a pair
07-02-2020T20:34:26,RimaDraws,no no lol
07-02-2020T20:34:31,RimaDraws,its nothing with video games
07-02-2020T20:34:41,RimaDraws,just them trying silly shit and doing it
07-02-2020T20:35:30,Dadrobit,"Yeah, the power hour is just silly stuff as well, like learning to do clay stop motion."
07-02-2020T20:36:01,RimaDraws,oh no this isnt clay stop motion lol. right now i am watching them eat this meal they made with citric acid and everything is sour
07-02-2020T20:36:07,RimaDraws,kinda gross but funny
07-02-2020T20:39:08,Dadrobit,My molars hurt just thinking about that...
07-02-2020T20:39:14,RimaDraws,yea... same
07-02-2020T20:49:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"I have an example of what the channel is: Marks punched a wall, eaten fire, and laid bareback on glass now"
07-02-2020T20:49:20,RimaDraws,i havent seen that far
07-02-2020T20:49:24,RimaDraws,im on the eating fire one
07-02-2020T20:49:50,SpazztasticKiwi,o yeah and he finally got to be tased
07-02-2020T20:49:54,SpazztasticKiwi,he didn’t enjoy it
07-02-2020T20:50:01,SpazztasticKiwi,what a shocker
07-02-2020T20:50:11,RimaDraws,lol
07-02-2020T20:57:02,SpazztasticKiwi,teaching Ethan how to build a doghouse though
07-02-2020T20:57:08,RimaDraws,that was fun
07-02-2020T20:57:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark looked like he wanted to throw himself in traffic
07-02-2020T20:57:22,RimaDraws,the fire eating thing bothers me so immensely
07-02-2020T20:58:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Ethan did say he hurt his tongue doing something for a video that we’d either had seen posted already or was going to post later
07-02-2020T20:58:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I imagine it’s that video
