23-10-2020T00:00:36,Twokinds,It better not be intentional!
23-10-2020T00:00:43,CrRAR,maybe thay fixed so many things they broke lots too XD
23-10-2020T00:00:45,NezumiYuki,Agreed!
23-10-2020T00:00:47,Twokinds,Or I'm going to be stuck with this version of photoshop.
23-10-2020T00:00:51,Twokinds,SURELY it can't be.
23-10-2020T00:01:01,Twokinds,I mean... how else do you pan the canvas while making a selection?
23-10-2020T00:01:23,Titanarisium,uh
23-10-2020T00:01:32,CrRAR,relative xkcd:
23-10-2020T00:01:33,Titanarisium,does mmb count?
23-10-2020T00:01:34,CrRAR,https://xkcd.com/2224/
23-10-2020T00:01:53,Ordithus,maybe adobe copied ms paint
23-10-2020T00:02:00,NezumiYuki,does dragging the navigator around work?  That's pretty poor if it does and the whole screen grab-pan-orbit doesn't !!!
23-10-2020T00:02:01,CrRAR,lol
23-10-2020T00:02:03,Dadrobit,Spaghetti code
23-10-2020T00:02:25,NezumiYuki,spaghetti code... aka Copy PASTA
23-10-2020T00:02:41,CrRAR,:cw0lfmare-ReniRawr::spaghetti:
23-10-2020T00:02:46,NezumiYuki,why so much pasta lately?  That's unhealthy!
23-10-2020T00:02:59,CrRAR,colder weather = pasta good
23-10-2020T00:03:05,KeefMcDerpface,But it's so good.
23-10-2020T00:03:31,NezumiYuki,well okay yes real pasta is WIN but coding copy-pasta... that's LOOSE
23-10-2020T00:03:31,Dadrobit,"God, there just is always the perfect xkcd"
23-10-2020T00:03:39,CrRAR,indeed
23-10-2020T00:04:17,Dadrobit,I almost went for the Abyss method a few PT updates ago when they messed with my hotkeys.
23-10-2020T00:04:48,Dadrobit,"Realistically, the new hotkeys are better/more sensible, but I had already LEARNED the old ones."
23-10-2020T00:05:15,CrRAR,yeah there's no reason they should push fundamental changes on anyone
23-10-2020T00:05:29,Twokinds,"What scares me is what if they never fix it? And then some day they CC stops supporting the 2020 version, and suddenly I can't use it anymore cause it doesn't connect to their subscription service anymore."
23-10-2020T00:05:34,Dadrobit,But it totally threw me off when suddenly half of my commands weren't working or doing random bullcrap.
23-10-2020T00:05:37,AspiringNoodle,Giving options is almost always superior to taking them away.
23-10-2020T00:05:40,Twokinds,So then I'm pretty much forced to crack the program.
23-10-2020T00:05:46,SageSaga,yep
23-10-2020T00:05:50,SageSaga,and thats ok
23-10-2020T00:05:52,CrRAR,yerpppp
23-10-2020T00:06:16,AspiringNoodle,There's a quote somewhere that's pretty accurate
23-10-2020T00:06:38,NezumiYuki,How goes the migrating back to the earlier P.S.  Tom?
23-10-2020T00:06:56,Dadrobit,Not having a perpetual license for a particular version of the software is horrifying.
23-10-2020T00:06:57,hyneria,"a friend had that happen recently. They used Poser for a number of things, but when Smith Micro sold the program to another company it closed its license servers"
23-10-2020T00:07:19,hyneria,and their Game Dev version of Poser stopped working because it is not supported by the new company
23-10-2020T00:07:22,AspiringNoodle,Found it
23-10-2020T00:07:27,AspiringNoodle,“Piracy is a service problem.” -Gabe Newell
23-10-2020T00:07:36,CrRAR,"he has the other one still, nezumi, didn't opt to uninstall it immediately"
23-10-2020T00:07:48,Twokinds,yeah I still have both versions
23-10-2020T00:07:56,AspiringNoodle,"If there is no legal way to get something, or the only legal way(s) is a complete garbage fire, piracy is the inevitable result."
23-10-2020T00:07:57,Twokinds,really glad I didn't select to overright the previous version
23-10-2020T00:08:03,Twokinds,I figured something like this might happen.
23-10-2020T00:08:03,Dadrobit,"Least one benefit of the physical usb drive lock is my license and version are local, can use it anywhere forever."
23-10-2020T00:08:27,NezumiYuki,"Good anticipation on your part, Tom!   Who knew you'd run into problems so soon?"
23-10-2020T00:08:37,Ordithus,"until windows 69 breaks it, dadro"
23-10-2020T00:08:45,CrRAR,oh yeah that mechanism... USB dongle license xD
23-10-2020T00:08:59,CrRAR,feels EXTRA substantial
23-10-2020T00:09:00,Dadrobit,Fuck off with your bad joo joo Ord!
23-10-2020T00:09:24,hyneria,not even win 69
23-10-2020T00:09:26,Dadrobit,I have enough software issues as it is!
23-10-2020T00:09:32,Ordithus,or usb drives are no longer installed
23-10-2020T00:09:36,hyneria,the next service update could break it
23-10-2020T00:09:44,hyneria,win 10 has a very bad rep about that
23-10-2020T00:10:06,Dadrobit,"Yeah, was gonna say, so long as USB A is a thing it'll work."
23-10-2020T00:10:20,CrRAR,adapters FTW

23-10-2020T00:12:17,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-keith8D:
23-10-2020T00:12:23,Twokinds,I hate subscription service
23-10-2020T00:12:24,SageSaga,nah you just move the USB storage to the next type of thumb drive storage
23-10-2020T00:12:26,CrRAR,"""It's the FUTURE!"""
23-10-2020T00:12:27,Twokinds,It's so scummy
23-10-2020T00:12:30,Dadrobit,I will make it work! We have the technology!
23-10-2020T00:12:33,CrRAR,yeah it isss
23-10-2020T00:12:59,Twokinds,"You know, the only reason I learned how to do digital art was with a cracked version of Photoshop 5.5 way back int 2002"
23-10-2020T00:13:00,AspiringNoodle,"Sadly, until a competitor comes out with a comparatively competitive product, with a perpetual license, Adobe will keep milking the sub cash cow"
23-10-2020T00:13:06,SageSaga,yeah- i own 3 copies of CSP- and one of them is forced to be a Subscription
23-10-2020T00:13:09,CrRAR,yeah but it's a proprietary license dongle thing sage
23-10-2020T00:13:35,NezumiYuki,subscriptions is the reason why I've never given serious thought to buying any of the more recent PhotoShop versions...
23-10-2020T00:13:37,SageSaga,if its software- it can be copied
23-10-2020T00:13:44,CrRAR,yeah that's what scares me about the way things are going LESS access to stuff
23-10-2020T00:14:01,Twokinds,I'm willing to bet a LOT of artists got their start on cracked software.
23-10-2020T00:14:04,Twokinds,"Like, A LOT"
23-10-2020T00:14:13,CrRAR,yuppp
23-10-2020T00:14:25,AspiringNoodle,No doubt.  Who would drop $200 - $300 on a new hobby with 0 experience?
23-10-2020T00:14:38,ZRO4825,Had cracked version of both Photoshop and PaintShopPro back when I first started editing images.
23-10-2020T00:14:39,SageSaga,honestly its thanks to things like CSP and Sai that less people are starting on cracked software
23-10-2020T00:14:45,AspiringNoodle,^^^^^^
23-10-2020T00:14:51,CrRAR,Larening should be easily accessible and curiosity driven
23-10-2020T00:14:56,SageSaga,"back in the ""Only Photoshop"" days- everyone was using cracked"
23-10-2020T00:15:07,Dadrobit,I'm on the fence about it. It 100% depends on the company and what they're doing for my money.
23-10-2020T00:15:11,CrRAR,"yeah, there are more options now"
23-10-2020T00:15:23,SageSaga,heck i know studios that bought licences but never installed them with the licences on a bunch of systems
23-10-2020T00:15:43,SageSaga,had teachers in college talking about it all the time
23-10-2020T00:15:53,NezumiYuki,"hey I know those feels all too well!  I mean, spending 250 bucks on a BASIC wacom bamboo without a fancy monitor built in, was still a hefty chunk of coins to dish out for a starting out artist!"
23-10-2020T00:16:03,SageSaga,"""yeah we bought copies for every system but they were all still running the cracked versions"""
23-10-2020T00:16:13,CrRAR,haha
23-10-2020T00:16:36,Dadrobit,"Like, PT is for professional work, to make money with. If I can't pull in $99 a year with the program, I should probably move on to other things. And I know that for the most part, the software development is active and good."
23-10-2020T00:16:38,NezumiYuki,dishing out 250 bucks anually for a photoshop subscription?  How even?!
23-10-2020T00:16:42,SageSaga,brb i need a break

23-10-2020T00:41:34,Dadrobit,"Ohhh yeah, that's annoying."
23-10-2020T00:42:06,NezumiYuki,"Only in the beginning did Adobe's staff actually use their own product, Tom.  They were originally a bunch of artists like ourselves... but as with most tech companies these days... none of the employees have touched photoshop or other adobe stuff."
23-10-2020T00:42:16,NezumiYuki,Ironic as it may seem yet... true.

23-10-2020T00:46:43,CrRAR,One trend I've noticed lately with software - OSes too- is that they're progressively rewriting core bits of programs at this point and often break functionality before restoring it.
23-10-2020T00:46:54,CrRAR,Not that it should EVER be released broken

23-10-2020T00:48:18,Dadrobit,Thanks for searching online for my search and not finding the thing sitting right there on the desktop.
23-10-2020T00:48:57,NezumiYuki,LOL Dadro... This is why I've turned off my Cortana...
23-10-2020T00:49:07,CrRAR,how boat that one day that they broke something at a microsoft datacenter and the search stopped working for LOCAL apps?
23-10-2020T00:49:46,NezumiYuki,"Please don't jinx it, RaR... That could happen...."

23-10-2020T00:50:32,KeefMcDerpface,This year at that?!
23-10-2020T00:50:43,Twokinds,I miss when Windows search was super fast
23-10-2020T00:50:53,Dadrobit,"Feb of this year, feels like half a decade ago."
23-10-2020T00:51:09,CrRAR,yeah it was just for an afternoon
23-10-2020T00:51:13,Mihari,"It can be super fast, you have just to do extra few steps to make so."
23-10-2020T00:51:27,CrRAR,"but it was like a mindtrip like ""Why is my start menu broken!?"""

23-10-2020T00:52:14,Dadrobit,"I think I missed it. Heard about it out, but I don't think it ever affected me."
23-10-2020T00:52:43,CrRAR,"yeah it was only a few hour window, I did experience it though"
23-10-2020T00:53:17,CrRAR,"It was one of those things, ""huh, I wonder what is causing that"""
23-10-2020T00:53:29,CrRAR,At first I thought Windows Indexing was borked
23-10-2020T00:53:37,NezumiYuki,"I think I saved myself and not even knew about it, because I turned off a shat ton of features in Windows from the day I unpacked the box to this desktop I'm using.  Bing was disabled... I think... from long ago.  Probably why I was unaware of this issue."
23-10-2020T00:53:48,CrRAR,cuz the indexing service in W10 is in charge of the Start enu manifest
23-10-2020T00:54:05,CrRAR,soetime being corrupted breaks it... but nooope
23-10-2020T00:54:15,CrRAR,sometimes
23-10-2020T00:54:43,CrRAR,it is a VERY strange dependency
23-10-2020T00:54:51,NezumiYuki,geez...
23-10-2020T00:54:56,NezumiYuki,never knew that either

23-10-2020T00:55:20,KeefMcDerpface,hellomods
23-10-2020T00:55:23,CrRAR,that the fact that the web search function not functioning makes you not able to search for apps
23-10-2020T00:55:39,CrRAR,very weird
23-10-2020T00:55:53,Dadrobit,"Mihari, are you talking about the Windows Start Menu search or the File Directory search? Because the Start Menu is always fast for me, (though often wrong) while the file directory search can take a few seconds to look around."
23-10-2020T00:55:53,CrRAR,on Msft's part
23-10-2020T00:56:02,tailsysmods,:)
23-10-2020T00:56:43,Mihari,Both
23-10-2020T00:57:00,Mihari,There are dozens of little changes you can make to windows in it's underbelly to speed it up.
23-10-2020T00:57:03,Twokinds,"Man Youtube has gotten so aggressive on the ""Are you still watching?"" popups"

23-10-2020T00:58:09,tailsysmods,Damn coppa
23-10-2020T00:58:33,NezumiYuki,Oh wait a sec... you mean to say that our Stoney is female?  xD  And here I thought Stoney was male...
23-10-2020T00:58:45,SageSaga,darn protecting children! forget the children!
23-10-2020T00:59:03,tailsysmods,Yeah it's more harm then good
23-10-2020T00:59:14,SageSaga,i was being sarcastic
23-10-2020T00:59:31,Dadrobit,37 ads in music mix videos makes me almost want to subscribe to just rid myself of them.

23-10-2020T01:00:14,tailsysmods,I will be back just browsing
23-10-2020T01:00:17,Dadrobit,"Stoney was made by Nora folks, is it being a lady really that surprising?"
23-10-2020T01:00:40,NezumiYuki,Also who else thinks this Kurzgesagt tune sounds a lot like Knight Rider 1980
23-10-2020T01:00:47,KeefMcDerpface,me
23-10-2020T01:01:07,CrRAR,I think the start of this one reminded me of Sonic: Pinball on Genesis

23-10-2020T01:38:56,Dadrobit,Hey unsteddy
23-10-2020T01:39:13,NezumiYuki,I think Tom is trying to make up for tonight's PhotoShop fiasco
23-10-2020T01:39:16,unsteddyphoenix,howdy howdy howdy
23-10-2020T01:39:35,Dadrobit,Stream was a bit delayed. Had to reinstall an older version of PS.
23-10-2020T01:39:36,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Hi Teddy
23-10-2020T01:39:43,unsteddyphoenix,Whaaaaat
23-10-2020T01:40:00,Dadrobit,Lines are too hard for the new version.
23-10-2020T01:40:01,unsteddyphoenix,Man tech problems come in waves huh
23-10-2020T01:40:31,AspiringNoodle,"And to think, Adobe charges MONTHLY for access to its software"
23-10-2020T01:40:37,NezumiYuki,"Some features to the updated PhotoShop are not available for seemingly dumb reasons, so tom had to cut the stream and boot up the older version of PS just to get things done...."
23-10-2020T01:40:59,ZRO4825,Sounds normal for a PS update to me. :joy:
23-10-2020T01:41:00,unsteddyphoenix,Like....lines?
23-10-2020T01:41:03,unsteddyphoenix,Like the line tool?
23-10-2020T01:41:13,NezumiYuki,"Yes Teddy, the line too"
23-10-2020T01:41:15,NezumiYuki,tool*
23-10-2020T01:41:18,JeremySenpai,PS is dumb
23-10-2020T01:41:34,Dadrobit,And lasso tool is not working while moving the canvas either.
23-10-2020T01:41:50,Ordithus,what does nyna think of boops
23-10-2020T01:41:51,unsteddyphoenix,Thats...it has to be a mistake of some sort
23-10-2020T01:41:56,unsteddyphoenix,Like theyll fix it tomorrow?
23-10-2020T01:42:03,unsteddyphoenix,How much would Nyna charge for boops asking for a friend
23-10-2020T01:42:11,JeremySenpai,Altho CSPs tweet to say all was fine and that it would work with windows update was a little so-so
23-10-2020T01:42:45,JeremySenpai,"""no major problems"""
23-10-2020T01:43:05,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I'm betting it's just buggy as hell atm. But who knows when fixes happen. Software be like that sometimes."
23-10-2020T01:45:39,AspiringNoodle,"Well, I'm out for the night.  Thanks for the stream guys"
23-10-2020T01:45:45,ZRO4825,"Take care, Noodle~"
23-10-2020T01:45:46,Dadrobit,"On the bright side of software development, EFT just added auto-sorting to the stash! So now I can organize my Marv-Killer munitions that much easier now!"
23-10-2020T01:45:47,AspiringNoodle,"And Tom, Stoney most definitely does NOT look garbage"

23-10-2020T01:59:34,SageSaga,i wonder how omni directional treadmills are coming along
23-10-2020T01:59:56,NezumiYuki,Wow sage... that was rather random
23-10-2020T01:59:59,Dadrobit,Huh. My little brother and I were talking about those literally this morning.
23-10-2020T02:01:00,Dadrobit,"In the context of other VR devices, like force feedback helmets and chest rigs."
23-10-2020T02:01:09,SageSaga,i feel like they are vital for early phase high end VR
23-10-2020T02:01:35,unsteddyphoenix,Thatd be so cool
23-10-2020T02:01:44,ZRO4825,"They are, and I hope they are coming along quickly because I need that shit in my life."
23-10-2020T02:01:55,ZRO4825,^_^
23-10-2020T02:02:32,SageSaga,its tough for me to get out of my house and go for a walk sometimes- but if you let me walk around in some of my favorite virtual worlds- i will walk till my legs hurt
23-10-2020T02:03:19,ZRO4825,Can't argue that
23-10-2020T02:05:31,Dadrobit,"No joke, I was recently offered a larger home to rent that I nearly took purely because it had a room that I could use purely for a VR environment."
23-10-2020T02:06:11,Dadrobit,"I could afford it, but it'd slow down my savings for a down payment on a mortgage, so I had to make the adult decision...."
23-10-2020T02:06:59,SageSaga,thus im hoping for a omni directional treadmill that fits in a 5x5 or 6x6 foot area
23-10-2020T02:07:38,SageSaga,thats a little smaller than 2x2 meters for our metric friends
23-10-2020T02:08:25,Twokinds,and enemies
23-10-2020T02:08:42,unsteddyphoenix,Thanks!

23-10-2020T12:39:20,CrRAR,Ah that’s interesting I just saw a reddit thread started with a cutesy pet rat gif and in the discussion they mention that pet rats enjoy sitting on shoulders and “cleaning” teeth if they can sneak it.
23-10-2020T12:39:27,CrRAR,I guess pet birds too.

23-10-2020T14:11:03,Ordithus,Hi!
23-10-2020T14:11:13,SageSaga,yo ord
23-10-2020T14:17:52,MoonDance,Comics~~~!
23-10-2020T14:18:08,Ordithus,Hi Moon
23-10-2020T14:18:19,MoonDance,Hi Ordithus
23-10-2020T14:18:22,MoonDance,And all!
23-10-2020T14:19:50,SageSaga,yo Moon
23-10-2020T14:21:11,SageSaga,so i finished another book last night- and i enjoyed it quite a bit for it being so odd
23-10-2020T14:22:41,SageSaga,the climatic battle of the book was done via sanitation
23-10-2020T14:23:41,SageSaga,"and the method of discovering the ""enemy"" was pretty cool"
23-10-2020T14:24:35,Ordithus,Sanitation? Wat
23-10-2020T14:25:21,SageSaga,imagine if you will- you are in a world where you can see your stats- and you step into a room and suddenly you gain a level in Radiation Resistance- and then suddenly your resistance to radiation started climbing rapidly- what would you assume? XD
23-10-2020T14:27:22,CrRAR,there’s lead afoot?
23-10-2020T14:27:41,SageSaga,. . .
23-10-2020T14:27:54,SageSaga,do... do you understand how stats work?
23-10-2020T14:28:40,Ordithus,raising rad resistance is an odd one
23-10-2020T14:28:59,CrRAR,What was it then?
23-10-2020T14:29:02,SageSaga,=_= you gain resistances as exposed to them
23-10-2020T14:30:24,SageSaga,the stat system was basically used as a canary for miners
23-10-2020T14:30:52,Ordithus,too convenient
23-10-2020T14:31:48,SageSaga,maybe i should have used the poison example
23-10-2020T14:31:54,MoonDance,Hm I need to finish 'A Brief History of Time' when I get the chance
23-10-2020T14:32:20,SageSaga,you are at a nobles dinner and you take a bite of the food and suddenly your poison resistance goes up.
23-10-2020T14:32:23,SageSaga,is that better?
23-10-2020T14:33:26,Ordithus,I'm just not connecting increased resistance with actively being subjected to something
23-10-2020T14:33:50,Ordithus,"Seems more of a long term affect, after recovery"
23-10-2020T14:33:52,SageSaga,but how? Thats like how most games work-
23-10-2020T14:34:05,CrRAR,Like immunity? Wasn’t there a leader that micro-dosed arsenic or cyanide to gain exposure and thus tolerance to it cuz he was paranoid of being poisioned?
23-10-2020T14:34:32,Ordithus,"Games are weird. Though I do love how in game logic if you want to get better at not dying from getting hit, just get hit more!"
23-10-2020T14:34:34,SageSaga,y'all... do play games right?
23-10-2020T14:34:39,CrRAR,Not that that works xD
23-10-2020T14:34:50,Ordithus,"Not much, actually!"
23-10-2020T14:35:10,Ordithus,More dnd than anything else
23-10-2020T14:36:05,SageSaga,then this is pretty much you enter a room and your DM asks for a Con save
23-10-2020T14:36:24,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-zenshocked: shouldn't have dumped con
23-10-2020T14:37:31,MoonDance,Anyone played Ghost of Tsushima?
23-10-2020T14:38:15,SageSaga,so imagine you have the awareness that you as your character are being forced to constantly make Con checks- you freak out right?
23-10-2020T14:38:54,MoonDance,yeah that's be pretty alerting
23-10-2020T14:39:15,Ordithus,those are moments it can be hard to roleplay and not let the meta break in
23-10-2020T14:39:21,Ordithus,but yeah
23-10-2020T14:39:35,SageSaga,"that's basically what happened- he realized it and was like ""OH &$%#! I gotta warn people and seal this place off!"""
23-10-2020T14:40:01,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-Disappoint: so immersion breaking
23-10-2020T14:40:48,SageSaga,how is that immersion breaking?
23-10-2020T14:41:43,SageSaga,isnt it literally the opposite?
23-10-2020T14:42:40,Ordithus,the character being aware of things like game stats usually is. In this case no
23-10-2020T14:42:51,Ordithus,Because that separation isn't there
23-10-2020T14:43:30,SageSaga,its not even just the character himself- everyone is aware of stats
23-10-2020T14:44:16,SageSaga,though it does remind me of that Prozd video
23-10-2020T14:45:50,SageSaga,Prozd video game life indicator video - https://youtu.be/rjZCb8zLo9M
23-10-2020T14:47:01,Ordithus,:heart::heart::black_heart::csagesaga-philhuh:
23-10-2020T14:50:01,CrRAR,"I do know what Sage is saying though, that by knowing the stats you can better put yourself into the role in the world."
23-10-2020T14:50:28,CrRAR,"That way it’s immersion, makes you feel more in their shoes."
23-10-2020T14:51:01,CrRAR,"Otherwise, there’s dissonance."
23-10-2020T14:52:05,CrRAR,"It’s like when you’re an actor, the director/screenwriter can help a more accurate portrayal by giving backstory or motivations."
23-10-2020T14:52:36,CrRAR,Cuz otherwise there’s no context.
23-10-2020T14:52:54,SageSaga,thats actually not what i was saying-
23-10-2020T14:53:00,CrRAR,lol
23-10-2020T14:53:20,SageSaga,i was saying in this world stats are known by all so any use of stats as an indicator made sense
23-10-2020T14:54:12,CrRAR,ah
23-10-2020T14:54:30,SageSaga,a D&D character that drinks a tasteless poison has to roll a con save- but if they succeed they dont suddenly know they drank poison- but the player can assume so
23-10-2020T14:54:48,SageSaga,but this is a world where they would be aware of such a roll basically
23-10-2020T14:55:03,SageSaga,making it more immersive that they do
23-10-2020T14:56:05,SageSaga,"Ord was giving me flashbacks to the idiots complaining about the use of words like ""hells"" and ""Gods"" being used in Baldurs gate saying it was immersion breaking"
23-10-2020T14:56:49,K3IDRAN,Damn
23-10-2020T14:56:50,SageSaga,they were saying they should just call it hell and God rather than making it plural because thats how we say it in real life

23-10-2020T14:58:56,SageSaga,they also complained that the use of accents was immersion breaking
23-10-2020T14:59:39,SageSaga,claiming the previous games didnt use accents
23-10-2020T14:59:40,K3IDRAN,Khajiit is confused
23-10-2020T14:59:45,Ordithus,Baldur's Gate would have bazillions of accents in it

23-10-2020T15:35:12,Twokinds,Every time I draw Stoney's tongue I question why a statue needs a tongue
23-10-2020T15:35:31,Kameloh,it adds character :ckameloh-naokigrin:
23-10-2020T15:35:53,SubMartinKotty,yeahh its kinda interesting
23-10-2020T15:35:57,SageSaga,how will it make La noises without one?
23-10-2020T15:36:00,SageSaga,magic?
23-10-2020T15:36:16,TeapotOfDoom,hi kame!
23-10-2020T15:36:23,SubMartinKotty,"but now again, if its a statue, how can it actually make ANY sound?"
23-10-2020T15:36:34,SubMartinKotty,if its a statue?
23-10-2020T15:36:40,SageSaga,by being designed to
23-10-2020T15:37:04,SubMartinKotty,hmm yeah maybe im thinking too deep into it
23-10-2020T15:37:07,TeapotOfDoom,~~minor illusion~~
23-10-2020T15:37:27,SageSaga,brb i gotta check on something
23-10-2020T15:37:31,SubMartinKotty,kk
23-10-2020T15:37:39,Twokinds,speakerbox
23-10-2020T15:37:45,TeapotOfDoom,:cteapotofdoom-kumipog:
23-10-2020T15:37:47,SubMartinKotty,hmmmm
23-10-2020T15:37:58,TeapotOfDoom,inb4 there's just a speaker in his mouth
23-10-2020T15:37:59,Ordithus,does stoneward get radio
23-10-2020T15:38:13,TeapotOfDoom,like stitch with the record player
23-10-2020T15:38:25,TeapotOfDoom,he can play vinyls
23-10-2020T15:38:30,SubMartinKotty,"i was like, surely it can't have vocal chords... but not that i think of it, it could have vocal chords, made with magic because if im correct nora actually made stoney"
23-10-2020T15:38:37,SubMartinKotty,now*
23-10-2020T15:38:45,sub2samuele,Hi everyone
23-10-2020T15:38:49,SubMartinKotty,hello sam
23-10-2020T15:38:54,TeapotOfDoom,o/
23-10-2020T15:39:09,sub2samuele,Hi
23-10-2020T15:43:33,Twokinds,I mean it's rock parts have to be at least somewhat flexible just to move.
23-10-2020T15:43:47,Twokinds,"Dunno how something can both be rock-like and plyable, but that's magic for ya."
23-10-2020T15:44:12,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rainehappy: Magic!
23-10-2020T15:45:53,unsteddyphoenix,stoney character sheet'll explain it~
23-10-2020T15:46:11,InTheLionsDen,Check the owner's manual.
23-10-2020T15:46:59,TeapotOfDoom,sry it's proprietary tech
23-10-2020T15:47:06,TeapotOfDoom,confidential information
23-10-2020T15:47:18,Ordithus,yo teddy
23-10-2020T15:47:31,TeapotOfDoom,hi teddy
23-10-2020T15:48:12,SageSaga,Transmutation magic makes many things possible but we do have semisoft solid objects- rubber can also be very hard yet pliable
23-10-2020T15:49:20,TeapotOfDoom,stoney made of rubber confirmed
23-10-2020T15:49:25,TeapotOfDoom,:cteapotofdoom-kumipog:
23-10-2020T15:49:26,SageSaga,or magic clay
23-10-2020T15:49:34,Twokinds,I wonder if someday science will invent materials that seem like magic to us now
23-10-2020T15:49:46,SageSaga,"pliable, soft yet absorbs impacts"
23-10-2020T15:49:50,TeapotOfDoom,pretty good chances
23-10-2020T15:49:50,MoonDance,magic playdough...
23-10-2020T15:49:50,Twokinds,Like they break the laws of physics
23-10-2020T15:49:51,unsteddyphoenix,hello~
23-10-2020T15:49:54,CrRAR,Like that sand that never gets wet!
23-10-2020T15:50:07,CrRAR,...might just be teflon coated tho
23-10-2020T15:50:18,TeapotOfDoom,i mean carbon fiber would blow the mind of someone living 100 years back
23-10-2020T15:50:24,CrRAR,Teflon is pretty magical
23-10-2020T15:50:30,Ordithus,"it blows my mind now, teapot"
23-10-2020T15:50:30,unsteddyphoenix,rules are made to be broken!
23-10-2020T15:50:32,Twokinds,ohio go zahi mass
23-10-2020T15:50:32,MoonDance,The blackesting thing known to man is created so I guess that's a start
23-10-2020T15:50:42,Hogan,Eveninges!
23-10-2020T15:50:50,CrRAR,evenin
23-10-2020T15:50:50,Ordithus,Hello Hogan
23-10-2020T15:50:55,SageSaga,oh what about  that weird thing with carbon fibers where it transfers heat but only in one direction? thats pretty crazy and seems to break thermodynamics but it actually doesnt
23-10-2020T15:50:57,TeapotOfDoom,hi hogan
23-10-2020T15:50:59,Hogan,Oh! Goodies in the makings :-)
23-10-2020T15:51:09,Hogan,"Hi Ordithus, hi Teaport :-)"
23-10-2020T15:51:11,TeapotOfDoom,oh yeah taht stuff
23-10-2020T15:51:13,unsteddyphoenix,oh hi yo
23-10-2020T15:51:22,TeapotOfDoom,something something nanotubes
23-10-2020T15:51:24,SubMartinKotty,"ngl I think that there will be in a near future a technological break that will allow ANYONE to transfomr into anything they want, wether it be changing gender, or change species altogether"
23-10-2020T15:51:27,CrRAR,Is it cuz of the structural branching?
23-10-2020T15:51:30,SubMartinKotty,now thats something i would go for
23-10-2020T15:51:30,MoonDance,Oh I guess liquid nitrogen can be one but that's kinda basic I guess
23-10-2020T15:51:56,Ordithus,"about carbon fiber, crrar?"
23-10-2020T15:52:03,TeapotOfDoom,i wanna try making ice cream with liquid nitrogen
23-10-2020T15:52:03,CrRAR,Yeah
23-10-2020T15:52:11,SubMartinKotty,"tbh I really admire technology, just seeing on how Japan is advanced in technology"
23-10-2020T15:52:14,SubMartinKotty,its just mental
23-10-2020T15:52:18,Ordithus,"it's a bunch of fibers, all in line, made of carbon, embedded in a plastic.  the carbon is conductive, but the plastic isn't"
23-10-2020T15:52:19,SubMartinKotty,thats why i want to visit japan and tokyo
23-10-2020T15:52:24,SubMartinKotty,because of their tech
23-10-2020T15:52:25,CrRAR,Is that how those pellets are made teapot?
23-10-2020T15:52:34,Ordithus,so it transfers heat/electricity along those fibers but not the other ways
23-10-2020T15:52:35,CrRAR,Ah I see
23-10-2020T15:52:36,TeapotOfDoom,what pellets?
23-10-2020T15:52:46,MoonDance,That's what the dippen dots are made with- Liquid Nitrogen
23-10-2020T15:52:47,TeapotOfDoom,oh yeah that was how that worked
23-10-2020T15:52:49,CrRAR,The Astrodots
23-10-2020T15:52:58,TeapotOfDoom,no idea
23-10-2020T15:53:04,TeapotOfDoom,oh
23-10-2020T15:53:08,CrRAR,Maybe that was just dry ice made
23-10-2020T15:53:12,TeapotOfDoom,yes i saw that once
23-10-2020T15:53:24,TeapotOfDoom,they are edible right?
23-10-2020T15:53:31,SageSaga,Ord - i thought it was just all carbon but all the carbon molocules are aligned right to left so all the heat goes out to the sides but not up and down
23-10-2020T15:53:33,MoonDance,hm Astronaut ice cream seems good right now...
23-10-2020T15:53:46,TeapotOfDoom,pretty sure that'y just ice cream base dropped in liquid N2
23-10-2020T15:53:49,SageSaga,but this one also wasnt about being conductive soo-
23-10-2020T15:53:54,SubMartinKotty,idk why but i would once in my life try MRE food
23-10-2020T15:54:05,SubMartinKotty,idk why but i really would like to try it once
23-10-2020T15:54:05,SageSaga,electrically conductive- this was just heat conduction
23-10-2020T15:54:06,Ordithus,"that's going to a much smaller scale than I know much about, sage"
23-10-2020T15:54:22,MoonDance,yeah they're freezed dried. But is good
23-10-2020T15:54:23,TeapotOfDoom,breaking laws of physics?
23-10-2020T15:54:35,SubMartinKotty,"btw, how can u even make a dry ice?"
23-10-2020T15:54:48,Ordithus,"compress carbon dioxide, a lot"
23-10-2020T15:54:55,TeapotOfDoom,try superconductors
23-10-2020T15:55:05,CrRAR,"Yeah, that’s what I pictured sage"
23-10-2020T15:55:07,TeapotOfDoom,and cool it a lot
23-10-2020T15:55:08,SubMartinKotty,"ah ok, I saw so many videos with dry ice experiments, no longer remember them"
23-10-2020T15:55:09,MoonDance,technically yes you can make dry ice
23-10-2020T15:55:10,SubMartinKotty,but its cool
23-10-2020T15:55:33,CrRAR,"Yeah, the phases of matter are influenced by pressure as well"
23-10-2020T15:55:37,MoonDance,Just get a fire extinguisher to get your ice
23-10-2020T15:55:44,TeapotOfDoom,"you can even make liquid nitrogen yourself, you just need something akin to a sterling engine in reverse"
23-10-2020T15:55:45,MoonDance,It's not a lot but still cheaper kinda
23-10-2020T15:55:45,CrRAR,That’s why caronated soda is under pressure
23-10-2020T15:56:05,CrRAR,The CO2 dissolves into liquid at the higher pressure
23-10-2020T15:56:07,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-power: Science!
23-10-2020T15:56:17,SageSaga,"i do like thinking about how scientist came up with the concept to try super conductive materials - ""Ok- but what if we put it in something REALLY cold?"""
23-10-2020T15:56:18,Ordithus,trivia on that - the carbon dioxide is in your soda as carbonic acid. Fun!
23-10-2020T15:56:19,CrRAR,Release the pressure and it precipitates out
23-10-2020T15:56:19,SubMartinKotty,"hydraulic press is also cool, I saw a video where they hydraulic pressed metal, and one of the metals got so pumped up with pressure that it snapped in half and one half literally flew across the room and shattered a window there"
23-10-2020T15:56:20,TeapotOfDoom,without filtering you even get some liquid oxygen which can be fun and really dangerous
23-10-2020T15:56:28,CrRAR,Aka bubbles!
23-10-2020T15:56:50,CrRAR,Same reason why it’s deadly to ascend from scuba diving too fast
23-10-2020T15:56:59,SubMartinKotty,sadly I will have to wait for quite some time until i can afford something really cool :D
23-10-2020T15:57:00,MoonDance,Since we are talking science stuff- Anyone got a favorite science subject? like zoology or chemistry?
23-10-2020T15:57:08,SubMartinKotty,not me
23-10-2020T15:57:17,CrRAR,Literally the dissolved gasses in your blood begin to carbonate
23-10-2020T15:57:17,SubMartinKotty,I really was bad at chemistry and science
23-10-2020T15:57:18,TeapotOfDoom,computer scientist sooo
23-10-2020T15:57:33,SubMartinKotty,but i was really good at history
23-10-2020T15:57:39,CrRAR,And precipitate out
23-10-2020T15:57:40,SageSaga,I ascend from my scuba diving all the time and I've never had any pineapple.
23-10-2020T15:57:48,Ordithus,wat
23-10-2020T15:57:52,MoonDance,I used to remember the perodic table by hear- but that was a few years ago...
23-10-2020T15:57:59,Twokinds,How does this page look
23-10-2020T15:57:59,SubMartinKotty,might be a reason on why i remember so many details about history and even a history/story that i really love
23-10-2020T15:58:01,Twokinds,I think I'm done
23-10-2020T15:58:06,SubMartinKotty,its really good
23-10-2020T15:58:06,Ordithus,spooky
23-10-2020T15:58:08,PopularDollars,looks good
23-10-2020T15:58:13,CrRAR,I’m spooked
23-10-2020T15:58:15,MoonDance,"Someday you'll find that pineapple, Sage"
23-10-2020T15:58:20,CrRAR,Trace is spooked
23-10-2020T15:58:21,MoonDance,keep searching!
23-10-2020T15:58:26,Twokinds,brb]
23-10-2020T15:58:28,SubMartinKotty,ready for the dialogue if there is some coming up :>

23-10-2020T15:58:47,Ordithus,"Bye, Tom! Thanks for the quick stream"

23-10-2020T16:00:37,Tharkis,"to be fair, she's cute when she's not grumpy too"
23-10-2020T16:01:20,TeapotOfDoom,sage is mihari immortal yet?
23-10-2020T16:01:24,MoonDance,"I see some margin lines in this page- are those for printing, Sage?"
23-10-2020T16:01:47,SageSaga,i always have the lines for the comics because it's to be printed XD
23-10-2020T16:02:06,MoonDance,"Ah, gotcha ^^;"
23-10-2020T16:02:19,SageSaga,Mihari is not immortal yet but im sure that changes tonight
23-10-2020T16:02:29,TeapotOfDoom,:cteapotofdoom-naoki_grin:
23-10-2020T16:03:06,TeapotOfDoom,d'you care to share what they're doing atm?
23-10-2020T16:03:26,MoonDance,Does anyone need to be slain for immortality tonight?
23-10-2020T16:03:46,TeapotOfDoom,(my game is kinda falling under the bus rn cus of lockdown the sequal)
23-10-2020T16:04:26,SageSaga,play online?
23-10-2020T16:04:39,SageSaga,she just got wish so shes gonna use that for the clone spell
23-10-2020T16:05:27,TeapotOfDoom,yeah probably what we're gonna do again. were looking forward to seeing people again (with precations of course) but it looks like lockdown is iminent again. so online we go
23-10-2020T16:07:26,TeapotOfDoom,also uni just started so that kinda made things difficult as well
23-10-2020T16:12:00,TeapotOfDoom,that's a lot of flowing hair right there
23-10-2020T16:12:03,Ordithus,both of my campaigns have slowed down a lot
23-10-2020T16:12:42,SageSaga,one of our players is moving to Hawaii soon i think
23-10-2020T16:14:37,MoonDance,Hawaii is a nice place to live... Away from the volcano's if possible
23-10-2020T16:19:54,SageSaga,almost done
23-10-2020T16:20:14,unsteddyphoenix,is it fluff?
23-10-2020T16:20:20,SageSaga,yep
23-10-2020T16:20:37,unsteddyphoenix,damn he really fell in loveafter that trip
23-10-2020T16:20:43,unsteddyphoenix,good for him
23-10-2020T16:20:57,TeapotOfDoom,pretty location to move to i imagine
23-10-2020T16:21:00,Ordithus,considering his career he can work pretty much anywhere
23-10-2020T16:21:21,SageSaga,thats how he feels about it- though i think he might be underestimating the cost a bit
23-10-2020T16:21:28,Tharkis,"one of my best friends lives in hawaii and is going to retire in  2 years, said i can stay at his place and he'll show me aroudn thei slands and go hiking and stuff"
23-10-2020T16:21:48,Tharkis,"this whole covid thing has messed up so many plans, i hope it's done and gone when he retires =D"
23-10-2020T16:21:50,SageSaga,im sure he can find a place and live alright- but Hawaii is the most expensive place to live in the US
23-10-2020T16:22:15,TeapotOfDoom,even compared to the big cities?
23-10-2020T16:22:23,SageSaga,yes
23-10-2020T16:22:34,SageSaga,all things considered- it is the most expensive state to live in
23-10-2020T16:22:34,Tharkis,"yeah, downtown NY and LA are more expensive but no one 'lives' downtown unless you're a millionaire"
23-10-2020T16:22:42,Tharkis,overall hawaii is $$$$ to live in
23-10-2020T16:22:50,Tharkis,"expensive food, expeisive rent, expensive gas, etc"
23-10-2020T16:22:51,SageSaga,cost of food is way higher too
23-10-2020T16:22:53,Tharkis,all the basics just cost more
23-10-2020T16:23:06,SageSaga,so much so that they have special deals for people who actually live there
23-10-2020T16:23:20,SageSaga,locals get discounts on a lot - but it's still expensive
23-10-2020T16:23:28,TeapotOfDoom,sounds like switzerland here
23-10-2020T16:23:56,TeapotOfDoom,tho you don't get discounts you just earn a lot
23-10-2020T16:24:37,Tharkis,"my friend is career airforce, lived on base in base housing etc his whole 25 years in the service so far, saved every penny"
23-10-2020T16:24:58,Tharkis,"paid cash for a house last year, retiring in 2 with full bennies and pay, and even then with no mortgage adn whatnot"
23-10-2020T16:25:18,Tharkis,just propety taxes and food and insurance and stuff means it's not going to be easy
23-10-2020T16:25:25,Tharkis,sooo expensive living there
23-10-2020T16:29:28,TheSexyBeast,"Everything in Hawaii has to be shipped in, thus the expensiveness"
23-10-2020T16:30:31,Tharkis,i have another friend who lives on one of the smaller islands and owns a big farm / ranch
23-10-2020T16:30:34,Tharkis,cows chickens etc
23-10-2020T16:30:55,Tharkis,"has like 1500 acres of property or something crazy, but the way the zoning is and stuff, it can only ever be farmland"
23-10-2020T16:32:36,MoonDance,Hm my pen nib keeps falling out- weird
23-10-2020T16:38:17,SageSaga,and done
