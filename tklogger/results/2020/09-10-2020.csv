09-10-2020T01:16:27,AspiringNoodle,work work work
09-10-2020T01:18:32,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s a page of boxes
09-10-2020T01:21:41,SpazztasticKiwi,sage is having his cubism phase
09-10-2020T01:21:57,Ordithus,it's not a phase mom
09-10-2020T01:22:15,AspiringNoodle,You'll grow out of it eventually~
09-10-2020T01:22:23,AspiringNoodle,*20 years later*
09-10-2020T01:22:31,AspiringNoodle,Huh... guess it wasn't a phase after all...
09-10-2020T01:32:22,AspiringNoodle,...Binging is a dangerous thing @_@
09-10-2020T01:34:24,AspiringNoodle,How's everyone holding up in this lovely beer virus world?
09-10-2020T01:35:01,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-GoogleyEmber:
09-10-2020T01:36:50,AspiringNoodle,"Ord, you ready for the spectacle that will be vaccines? xD"
09-10-2020T01:37:09,AspiringNoodle,"Depending on which one you get, some will require TWO shots."
09-10-2020T01:39:19,SageSaga,i dont care if they gotta stick me 8 times- bring it oooooon
09-10-2020T01:39:33,AspiringNoodle,That's the spirit! :ptv-excited:
09-10-2020T01:39:38,SageSaga,(note- last time i had blood taken it took 9 sticks to get me)
09-10-2020T01:39:44,Ordithus,ow
09-10-2020T01:39:46,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-shock:
09-10-2020T01:39:50,Ordithus,I know that too
09-10-2020T01:39:54,AspiringNoodle,"...you and my mother should swap stories, haha"
09-10-2020T01:39:54,SageSaga,i also hate needles and blood
09-10-2020T01:40:05,SageSaga,but at this point i want the pandemic gone
09-10-2020T01:40:13,AspiringNoodle,"When she was younger, she was a nurse, and she volunteered as test dummy for new nurses learning where to put needles"
09-10-2020T01:40:13,SageSaga,oh!
09-10-2020T01:40:18,SageSaga,OH OH OH OH
09-10-2020T01:40:21,Ordithus,oh?
09-10-2020T01:40:26,AspiringNoodle,ho?
09-10-2020T01:40:29,SageSaga,i didnt get to tell yall about this at the hospital!
09-10-2020T01:40:42,SageSaga,they put the IV in me in one shot- super easy-
09-10-2020T01:40:47,Ordithus,nice
09-10-2020T01:40:48,AspiringNoodle,oh boy
09-10-2020T01:40:50,AspiringNoodle,here it comes
09-10-2020T01:40:53,SageSaga,because they had this AWESOME TECH
09-10-2020T01:41:27,SageSaga,it projected green lasers onto my arm and was using something to scan- and then it would highlight the position of all my veins!
09-10-2020T01:41:31,SageSaga,IT WAS AWESOME!
09-10-2020T01:41:38,Ordithus,cool
09-10-2020T01:41:48,Ordithus,laser guided needles
09-10-2020T01:41:49,AspiringNoodle,...that is pretty sweet
09-10-2020T01:42:09,AspiringNoodle,"Ngl, I'm worried about the vaccines that will require multiple shots..."
09-10-2020T01:42:33,AspiringNoodle,"How many people are going to ""forget"" the extra shots?  Or not know about them?  Or actively disregard the need for the other shots?"
09-10-2020T01:43:17,Ordithus,most folks would probably understand and remember
09-10-2020T01:43:30,SageSaga,Warning! Shows needles being used- but this is the invention they used and it was so cool- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc1Rwy570Xs
09-10-2020T01:43:34,Ordithus,I think the hep vaccines required multiple shots?
09-10-2020T01:43:41,Ordithus,at least when I got them as a kid
09-10-2020T01:44:12,Ordithus,that is ridiculous
09-10-2020T01:44:34,AspiringNoodle,Dat is awesome!!!
09-10-2020T01:45:24,SageSaga,"the nurse was like ""We only have like 6 of these in the entire hospital- we keep one here for surgery- the others fight over them for labs"""
09-10-2020T01:46:37,SageSaga,"i was like ""Maaan- every lab room that involves taking blood should have one of these - and its sad they dont"""
09-10-2020T01:47:17,SageSaga,theres like no startup or buffer time- as soon as you flip the switch and shine it on the skin - bam- real time data
09-10-2020T01:48:13,AspiringNoodle,"Sadly, part of the reason American healthcare is so expensive"
09-10-2020T01:48:19,AspiringNoodle,We got all these fancy toys~
09-10-2020T01:48:33,SageSaga,i dont think thats the reason
09-10-2020T01:48:35,AspiringNoodle,Not saying it's the only reason healthcare is so expensive!  But it definitely doesn't help.
09-10-2020T01:48:43,SageSaga,prettttty sure most countries have this now too
09-10-2020T01:49:15,AspiringNoodle,Adam Ruins Everything had a pretty decent episode about healthcare costs
09-10-2020T01:49:19,AspiringNoodle,It's one of my favorites
09-10-2020T01:49:44,AspiringNoodle,Also: Don't watch if you have chronic high blood pressure.  Might lead to multiple problems :ptv-laugh:
09-10-2020T01:50:14,SageSaga,im aware of the health care problems in the US
09-10-2020T01:51:00,SageSaga,im also aware that the US government spends more per person on healthcare than any other nation- and yet many of those nations provide all the healthcare for their citizens-
09-10-2020T01:51:09,SageSaga,which is math that just does not add up -
09-10-2020T01:51:34,SageSaga,because thats what the government pays for healthcare for everyone-
09-10-2020T01:51:41,SageSaga,not what the people are also paying
09-10-2020T01:51:47,AspiringNoodle,"I want to look into wait times.  I've heard that in other nations with universal healthcare, wait times for certain surgeries can be horrendous."
09-10-2020T01:52:08,SageSaga,most of that is false from my research
09-10-2020T01:52:18,SageSaga,yes they have longer wait times on elective surgeries
09-10-2020T01:52:27,SageSaga,but not emergency or vital surgeries
09-10-2020T01:52:40,AspiringNoodle,"I should've been more specific, haha"
09-10-2020T01:53:05,AspiringNoodle,"I wanted to say for non-vital surgeries.  Things where it would improve quality of life, but not immediately needed."
09-10-2020T01:53:29,SageSaga,the US has a lot of for profit doctors that do cosmetic surgeries and you can get things done super fast
09-10-2020T01:53:55,SageSaga,most surgeons in other counties focus on non-cosmetic work
09-10-2020T01:54:22,AspiringNoodle,I wonder how far we could move on universal healthcare if we siphoned some budget away from the military...
09-10-2020T01:54:27,SageSaga,so if you are rich enough for new butt implants you are better off coming to the US for surgery
09-10-2020T01:54:28,AspiringNoodle,Or forced them to find ways to cut costs...
09-10-2020T01:55:10,SageSaga,we shouldnt have to - if we can just bring down cost to be like other countries the current payments by the government should more than cover everyone-
09-10-2020T01:55:19,SageSaga,thats never going to happen but thats math
09-10-2020T01:55:28,AspiringNoodle,"I think we have too much global presence, haha"
09-10-2020T01:55:44,SageSaga,not sure what that has to do with it?
09-10-2020T01:56:02,AspiringNoodle,It's part of why our military budget is so high.
09-10-2020T01:56:27,SageSaga,im again not talking about the military budget
09-10-2020T01:57:01,AspiringNoodle,"I know, but we have other issues besides healthcare that could benefit :("
09-10-2020T01:57:31,SageSaga,yeah but we also benefit from a huge military
09-10-2020T01:58:13,AspiringNoodle,"Alright, keep the size, but I still say we should cut costs if possible!"
09-10-2020T01:58:24,SageSaga,i agree
09-10-2020T01:58:33,AspiringNoodle,Can guarantee we're overpaying through the nose on a lot of our toys.
09-10-2020T01:58:59,SageSaga,hopefully one day we can all agree to have our war in video games so theres no loss of life
09-10-2020T01:59:04,Sclimshady,"We could honestly cut costs by just changing how we do contracts,  we payed 98 dollars for a single 1 in grade 8 nut"
09-10-2020T01:59:28,Sclimshady,Is this SAO alicizatioin?
09-10-2020T01:59:36,Ordithus,ah but that nut has specifications and traceability!
09-10-2020T01:59:38,Sclimshady,Aliceization
09-10-2020T01:59:42,SageSaga,no
09-10-2020T01:59:51,Sclimshady,Ii dont remember how to spell it
09-10-2020T01:59:57,Sclimshady,No iit doesnt
09-10-2020T02:00:03,AspiringNoodle,"So, the cheapest fighter jets the US military buys today cost $82.4 million each"
09-10-2020T02:00:08,SageSaga,there was some movie about doing wars as all digital though-
09-10-2020T02:00:10,Sclimshady,I can get the same one at ace for a dollar 15
09-10-2020T02:00:24,AspiringNoodle,"In 2022, the cost is projected to go down to $77.9 million"
09-10-2020T02:00:35,AspiringNoodle,Like... dat's a lot of moneys
09-10-2020T02:00:41,Sclimshady,And the aiirforce spent 1200 on a coffee cup
09-10-2020T02:00:50,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s no emote for my expression rn for this
09-10-2020T02:01:00,AspiringNoodle,For the love of god

09-10-2020T02:01:41,SageSaga,waiting for a sale

09-10-2020T02:04:26,SpazztasticKiwi,unwillingness to move forward with life assures you’ll be left in the past

09-10-2020T02:04:43,Sclimshady,Im scared of the future you envision Sage
09-10-2020T02:04:52,AspiringNoodle,Sclim.  Play SOMA.
09-10-2020T02:04:55,SageSaga,no- your friends and family will love the AI- all will love the AI

09-10-2020T02:12:42,Sclimshady,Is it the update where it actually works?
09-10-2020T02:13:08,AspiringNoodle,Wait... Picarto legit used Tom as an example for their updates? xD
09-10-2020T02:13:15,AspiringNoodle,Link?
09-10-2020T02:13:33,ZRO4825,Not out yet I believe
09-10-2020T02:13:45,CrRAR,haha
09-10-2020T02:14:04,CrRAR,yeah launch was delayed
09-10-2020T02:14:05,ZRO4825,Unless... :thinking:
09-10-2020T02:14:10,SageSaga,heres the info  on the update - https://landing.picarto.tv/#section-1
09-10-2020T02:14:36,CrRAR,I think they said changes behind the scenes will gradually happen
09-10-2020T02:15:33,CrRAR,Then the big design overhaul launch
09-10-2020T02:16:19,AspiringNoodle,I see Tom in pic :ptv-excited:
09-10-2020T02:16:29,CrRAR,lol I don’t know what “Stream Raiding” is...

09-10-2020T02:18:37,SpazztasticKiwi,what bad link and update
09-10-2020T02:24:18,Mihari,"There are two forms of streaming raiding, one is great, one is very bad."
09-10-2020T02:25:18,Mihari,The good is where one stream ends and just has it's viewers poor into another usually just adding more viewers on the next content. The bad one is where a wave of trolls jump in and just start being malicious and vile in general.
09-10-2020T02:27:14,AspiringNoodle,Ugh... I remember when we had to whitelist a stream because some douche was being super obnoxious and persistent...
09-10-2020T02:27:26,AspiringNoodle,I can't imagine trying to do that with a larger stream...
09-10-2020T02:27:30,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all!
09-10-2020T02:27:34,AspiringNoodle,Howdy Dadro
09-10-2020T02:27:39,Ordithus,o/ robit
09-10-2020T02:30:02,Dadrobit,"Had a wee silly problem earlier with one of my favorite residents. Poor lady locked herself out of her vehicle with her phone, keys, and purse inside."
09-10-2020T02:30:34,Dadrobit,"She had an extra key, but the vehicle didn't have a keyhole. All electronic."
09-10-2020T02:30:45,AspiringNoodle,RIP
09-10-2020T02:31:07,Dadrobit,Had to wait with her until the locksmith got there to open it up for her.
09-10-2020T02:31:15,SpazztasticKiwi,how exactly do you fix that
09-10-2020T02:31:20,Ordithus,I'm curious
09-10-2020T02:31:28,Dadrobit,"Very super nice lady though, very fun to talk with."
09-10-2020T02:31:30,SpazztasticKiwi,are you given a skeleton key when you’re hired
09-10-2020T02:31:54,Ordithus,:hammer: <-- skeleton key
09-10-2020T02:32:05,SpazztasticKiwi,close enough
09-10-2020T02:32:25,Dadrobit,They put a small inflatable air bladder inside the door which pries it open just enough to get a jimmy in to pull open the lock.
09-10-2020T02:32:52,Dadrobit,"30 seconds, tops."
09-10-2020T02:33:22,SageSaga,i just cast mage hand and click the button on the door from the inside
09-10-2020T02:33:43,AspiringNoodle,I cast Hulk Smash and break the window :ptv-laugh:
09-10-2020T02:33:56,Ordithus,security experts hate wizards
09-10-2020T02:34:04,AspiringNoodle,But love Hulks?
09-10-2020T02:34:17,SpazztasticKiwi,go go gadget ghost mode
09-10-2020T02:34:24,Ordithus,would you tell hulk you don't love him
09-10-2020T02:34:45,AspiringNoodle,Hmmm
09-10-2020T02:34:47,SageSaga,"""The door is locked"" ""Knock"" ""There is no one there"" ""No- I cast Knock"""
09-10-2020T02:35:08,Dadrobit,I can at least call the cops on the Hulk. Wizards would do some crazy shit like burn out the phones first.
09-10-2020T02:35:14,SpazztasticKiwi,“...with my battering ram”
09-10-2020T02:35:35,Mihari,"Speaking of Knock, is it in BG3?"
09-10-2020T02:36:04,Dadrobit,"Oh, is that out now? I recall y'all looking forward to it."
09-10-2020T02:36:04,SageSaga,havent gotten second level spells yet
09-10-2020T02:36:32,Ordithus,"always felt in rpgs that if there's a locked door or container, a warhammer or axe out to be sufficient ""lockpick"""
09-10-2020T02:36:36,SageSaga,its very buggy but they are hotfixing like demons
09-10-2020T02:36:59,SageSaga,well you are wrong Ord
09-10-2020T02:37:14,SageSaga,those arent good at picking locks- but they can still open doors
09-10-2020T02:37:25,AspiringNoodle,"""Smashy McFacerton"" says otherwise"
09-10-2020T02:37:30,Ordithus,hence the quotes
09-10-2020T02:38:50,SageSaga,"i tried to open a door and my character said ""A door with no knob or lock? How is it suposed to open?"" and then i used the Gith girl to smash it with her greatsword"
09-10-2020T02:39:27,Ordithus,problem. solved.
09-10-2020T02:42:44,AspiringNoodle,It feels like my imagination is on drugs sometimes xD
09-10-2020T02:43:23,Dadrobit,"Game updates, reminds me that I need to find the time to hop back into NMS again sometime soon. Another update just launched with a bunch of new stuffs."
09-10-2020T02:44:10,Dadrobit,I think I  have 2 updates to catch up on there. Haven't played many games since school started back up.
09-10-2020T02:51:30,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, you were right, Dadro xD"
09-10-2020T02:51:48,AspiringNoodle,"2 months later, and I'm burning out on WoW... again..."
09-10-2020T02:51:51,Dadrobit,???
09-10-2020T02:51:57,Dadrobit,"Oh, yep."
09-10-2020T02:52:37,Ordithus,"2 months is about how long I played it, ever"
09-10-2020T02:52:41,AspiringNoodle,Haha.
09-10-2020T02:52:49,AspiringNoodle,BEST PIC SAGE!!!
09-10-2020T02:53:05,Dadrobit,2 hours
09-10-2020T02:53:25,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, part of it is my own dang fault"
09-10-2020T02:53:31,Dadrobit,"Like, more than a decade ago."
09-10-2020T02:53:39,AspiringNoodle,I'm collecting stuff I'll never use just for the sake of filling boxes -3-
09-10-2020T02:55:12,Dadrobit,"The Battle Chest for Starcraft Brood War had a trial code in it for WoW. Downloaded it, played part of one night, went back to StarCraft."
09-10-2020T02:55:30,AspiringNoodle,Was this the original expansion?
09-10-2020T02:55:40,AspiringNoodle,"errr, game?"
09-10-2020T02:56:05,Ordithus,"suspect he would not know, considering he spent all of 2 hours on it"
09-10-2020T02:56:08,Ordithus,long ago
09-10-2020T02:56:12,Dadrobit,"Brood War? Yeah, it was the first StarCraft's expansion."
09-10-2020T02:56:31,Dadrobit,WoW? Not a damn clue
09-10-2020T02:57:19,AspiringNoodle,Probably was the original version of WoW
09-10-2020T02:57:28,AspiringNoodle,The game has changed a lot since then
09-10-2020T02:58:51,Ordithus,crazy that game is still going
09-10-2020T02:59:23,Dadrobit,$$$$$$$$
09-10-2020T03:00:30,Ordithus,though Yosh! and TK predate it
09-10-2020T03:00:54,Dadrobit,Does EVE Online? I forget.
09-10-2020T03:01:17,ZRO4825,Pretty sure EVE wasn't a thing till around 2008 or so.
09-10-2020T03:01:27,AspiringNoodle,WoW's been in a bad spot recently
09-10-2020T03:01:29,Ordithus,"looked it up, EVE online was released in 03"
09-10-2020T03:01:30,ZRO4825,"I could be mistaken though, tbf."
09-10-2020T03:01:37,ZRO4825,:thinking: 03? really?
09-10-2020T03:01:41,Dadrobit,"2003, yep. WoW was 2004."
09-10-2020T03:01:49,AspiringNoodle,"BFA is competing with WoD for ""worst expansion"""
09-10-2020T03:01:49,ZRO4825,"Cuz I don't think I ever even HEARD of it till somewhere around 2010, lol"
09-10-2020T03:02:03,Ordithus,same
09-10-2020T03:02:12,ZRO4825,"Noodle, that's a really hard judgment to truly make because the only opinions you're gonna get are the vocal minorities, lol"
09-10-2020T03:02:23,AspiringNoodle,"Shadowlands is gonna be a make or break for the game.  If they have a 2nd BFA-tier expansion in a row, it will take a long time for WoW to recover."
09-10-2020T03:02:28,Dadrobit,It's kept up by folks like me who play once every 2 months but keep the subscription going I think.
09-10-2020T03:02:53,AspiringNoodle,"And honestly, I preferred WoD over BFA, haha."
09-10-2020T03:03:05,ZRO4825,Besides. FFXI has lasted longer than WoW and EVE both. :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
09-10-2020T03:03:17,SageSaga,i remember drawing Yosh! in class while my teacher showed us the WoW beta as an example of terrible texturing
09-10-2020T03:03:25,AspiringNoodle,HA XD
09-10-2020T03:03:38,Ordithus,ff xi was also 03
09-10-2020T03:03:42,ZRO4825,'02
09-10-2020T03:04:10,ZRO4825,May 16 2002 in Japan. NA didn't get it for a year or two as I recall.
09-10-2020T03:04:10,Ordithus,ah
09-10-2020T03:04:29,Dadrobit,"Also have the new EVE Online Mobile. It's actually surprisingly true to the original, really solid game play. Free play is a bit too limited imho though."
09-10-2020T03:04:36,Ordithus,playable on ps2 until '16 wow
09-10-2020T03:04:52,ZRO4825,"Yup. They finally cut off the consoles about then, lol"
09-10-2020T03:05:14,ZRO4825,"Game can be made to look a good bit prettier now with file mods, lol"
09-10-2020T03:05:15,Dadrobit,PS2 was a ridiculously good generation.
09-10-2020T03:06:00,Dadrobit,Is XI still a paid subscription?
09-10-2020T03:06:51,SageSaga,when i was playing a guy offered me 10k gil to dance naked for him- i told him i was a guy- he said my polygons say otherwise - i did not dance for him
09-10-2020T03:07:56,Dadrobit,Even EVE has gone f2p at this point. I'm surprised subscription models are still a thing tbh when it comes to games. Cash shops have proven crazy profitable.
09-10-2020T03:09:33,AspiringNoodle,WoW is big brain
09-10-2020T03:09:45,AspiringNoodle,"They have a subscription, AND a cash shop :ptv-snicker:"
09-10-2020T03:09:48,Dadrobit,"I mean, I'm not SUPER surprised subscriptions are sti a thing, they're everywhere now. Just so many other games have the f2p model option at least."
09-10-2020T03:10:14,AspiringNoodle,*sigh*
09-10-2020T03:10:24,AspiringNoodle,"I should probably avoid ""live service"" games ._."
09-10-2020T03:10:44,AspiringNoodle,They thrive on FOMO.  And I think I'm particularly susceptible.
09-10-2020T03:11:52,AspiringNoodle,Night everyone
09-10-2020T03:12:00,Ordithus,night noodle
09-10-2020T03:12:03,Dadrobit,o7
09-10-2020T03:13:38,Dadrobit,Brb
09-10-2020T03:16:05,SageSaga,i need a hair cut
09-10-2020T03:17:27,Ordithus,embrace the floor length hair
09-10-2020T03:20:51,Mihari,Was getting there! XD
09-10-2020T03:22:46,SageSaga,i wonder if i brush my bangs in my eyes and just cut a straight line if it would make my hair look weird
09-10-2020T03:23:03,SageSaga,i just need the hair out of my eyes while i work
09-10-2020T03:25:04,ZRO4825,"Sorry, Dadro, was playing some Squadrons, but yes, FFXI is still subscription based"
09-10-2020T03:25:32,ZRO4825,"And honestly, I like when MMOs are sub based instead of F2P. Overall quality always feels better that way."
09-10-2020T03:38:02,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz: g'night
09-10-2020T03:38:06,ZRO4825,G'night Ord!

09-10-2020T16:14:07,TeapotOfDoom,is this the part of the stream where i can ask you about dnd stuff and keep you from making progress?
09-10-2020T16:14:18,TeapotOfDoom,how are you feeling btw?
09-10-2020T16:14:33,SageSaga,im actually done with the comic now XD
09-10-2020T16:14:36,TeapotOfDoom,shit
09-10-2020T16:14:45,TeapotOfDoom,5 min too late
09-10-2020T16:14:53,SageSaga,so i can stick around a bit and answer questions
09-10-2020T16:14:56,TeapotOfDoom,nice
09-10-2020T16:15:00,TeapotOfDoom,great work btw
09-10-2020T16:15:28,TeapotOfDoom,how are you? everything went well with surgery i hope?
09-10-2020T16:15:52,SageSaga,yeah surgery went well but recovery took longer than expected
09-10-2020T16:16:18,TeapotOfDoom,hope it helped
09-10-2020T16:16:40,TeapotOfDoom,suppose you had a break from dnd as well then
09-10-2020T16:17:14,SageSaga,no - I managed to run the D&D game last week and we will have it this week too
09-10-2020T16:17:23,SageSaga,tonight even
09-10-2020T16:17:44,TeapotOfDoom,wow on that dedication
09-10-2020T16:18:05,TeapotOfDoom,mihari still not imortal?
09-10-2020T16:18:46,SageSaga,its not that big a deal- the recovery time was like 5 days- so by Saturday i was feeling pretty good- Friday i was in a ton of pain though- but once the meds kicked in that went away fast and didnt come back
09-10-2020T16:18:57,SageSaga,everyone but Mihari is Immortal
09-10-2020T16:19:24,SageSaga,she needs another level or so to start her own immortality XD
09-10-2020T16:19:37,TeapotOfDoom,i still think that's the best prank ever xD
09-10-2020T16:19:52,SageSaga,eh?
09-10-2020T16:20:05,TeapotOfDoom,you said that immortality kinda was her thing?
09-10-2020T16:20:35,SageSaga,she pretty much always wants to obtain it for her characters
09-10-2020T16:20:38,TeapotOfDoom,so imo it's really funny that she's the only one who is not immortal at this point
09-10-2020T16:20:50,TeapotOfDoom,yeah
09-10-2020T16:20:58,SageSaga,guess she likes knowing that her characters went on through the ages after we finish playing
09-10-2020T16:21:19,TeapotOfDoom,wonder if immortality is such a fun thing in dnd
09-10-2020T16:21:22,TeapotOfDoom,probably tho
09-10-2020T16:21:33,TeapotOfDoom,what game were you running atm? i forgot
09-10-2020T16:21:54,SageSaga,running D&D 5e Custom Eberron Game
09-10-2020T16:22:07,TeapotOfDoom,Eberron right
09-10-2020T16:22:18,TeapotOfDoom,i proposed an idea to my group
09-10-2020T16:22:46,TeapotOfDoom,had the idea to pause our homebrew main campaign for a few sessions and do a different game for a few sessions
09-10-2020T16:22:47,SageSaga,"They  started out as Refugees from a little town and moved to Sharn - adjusted to ""City living"" and blew up as Adventurers due to their unique skills"
09-10-2020T16:23:35,TeapotOfDoom,wonder what would be fitting as such a short game tho. should get some story done in 4-8 sessions
09-10-2020T16:23:37,SageSaga,stopping stream btw- im still here though
09-10-2020T16:24:05,TeapotOfDoom,any ideas what could work?
09-10-2020T16:24:59,SageSaga,well - any low level game can be pretty short if you stick to a basic adventure
09-10-2020T16:25:10,TeapotOfDoom,hmmm
09-10-2020T16:25:19,SageSaga,I ran a short game where a bunch of low level people were caught in a town being taken over by a lich
09-10-2020T16:25:34,TeapotOfDoom,oh fun :cteapotofdoom-kumipog:
09-10-2020T16:25:49,TeapotOfDoom,one of them mentioned interrest in ravenloft
09-10-2020T16:25:56,SageSaga,they werent strong enough to fight the lich head on so they worked on guerrilla tactics
09-10-2020T16:26:00,TeapotOfDoom,that would be something completely different from what we normally play
09-10-2020T16:26:17,TeapotOfDoom,oh nice how did you bring him down?
09-10-2020T16:26:20,SageSaga,Ravenloft is not a short game- unless everyone just dies in which case- it is short
09-10-2020T16:26:42,TeapotOfDoom,lol
09-10-2020T16:26:52,TeapotOfDoom,as far as i have seen that is pretty likely
09-10-2020T16:27:04,SageSaga,they didnt bring him down- they just stopped his rituals from working by sabotage and freeing the people
09-10-2020T16:27:08,TeapotOfDoom,dnd podcast i am watching is trying to do it in 7 sessions or so
09-10-2020T16:27:25,TeapotOfDoom,so the litch is still out there?
09-10-2020T16:28:27,SageSaga,"the Lich was not killed, but his plans were ruined and he didnt ever figure out who was responsible because they did a good job of hiding"
09-10-2020T16:28:50,TeapotOfDoom,nice
09-10-2020T16:29:04,TeapotOfDoom,that one was self made?
09-10-2020T16:29:14,TeapotOfDoom,or dmsguild or similar?
09-10-2020T16:29:40,SageSaga,"when they saved a bard he was like ""I shall create a song speaking of your exploits!"" and they were like ""Cool- but dont actually mention us by name, just call us the nameless heroes"""
09-10-2020T16:29:47,SageSaga,selfmade
09-10-2020T16:30:06,SageSaga,I run a lot of self made campaigns - but there are a few Modules I've run and enjoyed
09-10-2020T16:30:26,TeapotOfDoom,not sure if i like premade or selfmade more at this point
09-10-2020T16:30:26,SageSaga,I really liked Storm Kings Thunder because it was so open for people to do stuff- i got to make up a bunch of stuff for that
09-10-2020T16:30:31,TeapotOfDoom,not enough experience
09-10-2020T16:30:42,TeapotOfDoom,nice
09-10-2020T16:30:47,SpazztasticKiwi,👁👁
09-10-2020T16:30:58,TeapotOfDoom,i have to look into that one at some point. got the dm-screen from that one
09-10-2020T16:31:01,TeapotOfDoom,hi spazz
09-10-2020T16:31:08,SageSaga,Tomb of Annihilation was great until you actually get into the Tomb
09-10-2020T16:32:10,TeapotOfDoom,why?
09-10-2020T16:32:15,SageSaga,oh- I've heard that Lost Mine of Phandelver is great to run for starters
09-10-2020T16:32:38,SageSaga,because the Tomb has a ton of puzzles where you solve them correctly - and horrible things happen anyways
09-10-2020T16:32:52,TeapotOfDoom,lol well
09-10-2020T16:33:05,TeapotOfDoom,i have one puzzle i really wanna use some time
09-10-2020T16:33:08,SageSaga,"its like the puzzles are traps most of the time- so its like ""Hey guys- wanna do an annoying puzzle only to have the room fill with acid?"""
09-10-2020T16:33:18,TeapotOfDoom,oof
09-10-2020T16:33:40,SageSaga,there's also a few puzzles that do not have good solutions
09-10-2020T16:33:51,TeapotOfDoom,also copied the one you recommended ima look into that
09-10-2020T16:34:36,SageSaga,"its like ""There is a door that you cannot open- how do you open it?"" (Key- The answer is to draw a circle around the door in mud!)"
09-10-2020T16:34:45,TeapotOfDoom,ah just noticed: your favicon on artificial incident is that standard wordpress one. just wanted to give you a heads up in case that's not intentional
09-10-2020T16:35:05,TeapotOfDoom,what why? what kind of solution is that
09-10-2020T16:35:28,SageSaga,thats basically what it is without giving away the actual puzzle
09-10-2020T16:35:38,TeapotOfDoom,the puzzle i wanna use is a room with a pedastal in the middle with a button on top
09-10-2020T16:35:50,SageSaga,and the countdown?
09-10-2020T16:35:55,TeapotOfDoom,yup
09-10-2020T16:35:59,TeapotOfDoom,you know that one?
09-10-2020T16:36:01,SageSaga,yeah i know it well
09-10-2020T16:36:15,SageSaga,it's how the Tomb of Annihilation starts too
09-10-2020T16:36:17,TeapotOfDoom,you've seen the animated spellbook haven't you
09-10-2020T16:36:31,TeapotOfDoom,ohh well that one's actually good imo
09-10-2020T16:36:39,TeapotOfDoom,cus it's just a pure mindfuck
09-10-2020T16:37:07,SageSaga,"yeah its supposed to make your group go ""oh just dont over think the puzzles"""
09-10-2020T16:37:36,SageSaga,but then it throws stupid puzzle after stupid puzzle at you in the tomb nullifying the message of the first puzzle
09-10-2020T16:37:46,TeapotOfDoom,yeah
09-10-2020T16:38:11,SageSaga,a lot of them you really have to over think to get a clue
09-10-2020T16:38:25,TeapotOfDoom,"that sounds like someone was going in on this whole thing with ""lets make a whole lotta puzzles in this map"" and then ""shit i'm outa good ideas"""
09-10-2020T16:38:58,TeapotOfDoom,puzzles are fun with my group cus we could not figure out the last one for the life of us
09-10-2020T16:39:39,TeapotOfDoom,it was a elementary school level puzzle and our dm told us afterwards he wasn't sure if it was hard enough
09-10-2020T16:39:51,TeapotOfDoom,we figured it out seconds before the time was up
09-10-2020T16:46:04,SageSaga,alright well im gonna get things ready for the game tonight and figure out dinner- take care!

09-10-2020T20:56:39,AspiringNoodle,Customer was trying to get  one of the bigger 20+ oz cans from the top shelf when it snagged on the display
09-10-2020T20:56:52,AspiringNoodle,"errr, shelfing, lol"
09-10-2020T20:57:17,AspiringNoodle,"Punctured a small hole in the side, spent half an hour cleaning up the cans below it"

09-10-2020T21:33:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Marks mic cuts out so the others went to tell him to run cause that means the ghost has him targeted
09-10-2020T21:33:52,SpazztasticKiwi,they get to the door & it’s locked but all you hear is a very distant Mark screaming at the top of his lungs
09-10-2020T21:34:37,SpazztasticKiwi,then the door opens
09-10-2020T21:34:42,SpazztasticKiwi,he was v dead
