26-11-2020T00:00:38,CrRAR,yeah
26-11-2020T00:05:04,Dadrobit,EVE Online was actually my first introduction to radial menus (vs drop-down) and I hated it at first. Now I can't live without it (in that game).
26-11-2020T00:05:59,CrRAR,yeah it throws you just because it deviates from everything else
26-11-2020T00:06:17,Dadrobit,"Hotkeys are always gonna be the fastest for productivity, but radial menus really can make for some smooth operations."
26-11-2020T00:06:20,CrRAR,orderly. grids. :ptv-unimpressed:
26-11-2020T00:06:31,CrRAR,yeah
26-11-2020T00:06:55,SpazztasticKiwi,the essentials
26-11-2020T00:07:03,SpazztasticKiwi,my screen is much busier
26-11-2020T00:07:18,CrRAR,if anything it would make icon layout near the corner look more refined/deliberate
26-11-2020T00:07:39,CrRAR,I mean that's what they're hoping the dock is for I guess
26-11-2020T00:08:17,CrRAR,but it's not the most convenient
26-11-2020T00:08:44,CrRAR,pretty icons everywhereeee
26-11-2020T00:08:56,Dadrobit,"Spazz, you should see my full app list. Like 100+. Used to have like 5 pages of random shit."
26-11-2020T00:10:34,Dadrobit,My drag down apps pages is still a godawful mess of everything I've downloaded in chronological order.
26-11-2020T00:14:38,CrRAR,"ha, it's funny how that varies, most are just alphabetical, no?"
26-11-2020T00:15:03,CrRAR,can it be sorted to pref?
26-11-2020T00:18:29,Dadrobit,"Just looked. I can sort it to alphabetical, but I think I'll keep it as is."
26-11-2020T00:19:00,CrRAR,"yeah, familiar."
26-11-2020T00:24:56,SpazztasticKiwi,why do cats see you drinking and decide “imma bump the bottom of that so they half drown themselves”
26-11-2020T00:25:32,CrRAR,"""Hurry human"""
26-11-2020T00:25:53,CrRAR,"""Faster drinking means more pets sooner!"""
26-11-2020T00:26:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I have about 100 apps but the ones on the last page are useless or what I don’t use & cane with the phone
26-11-2020T00:26:28,SpazztasticKiwi,also my amazon and other important accounts connected to my wallet
26-11-2020T00:26:59,CrRAR,anyone spotting any good Black Friday deals yet?
26-11-2020T00:27:16,CrRAR,or Cyber-whateverthehellthisis?
26-11-2020T00:28:11,Dadrobit,"Not even looking. Might check to see if any new PS5s are in stock at midnight, but that's about it."
26-11-2020T00:28:43,CrRAR,yeah you would think in order to HAVE a holiday rush there would need to be something to rush FOR.
26-11-2020T00:28:49,AspiringNoodle,"If the government would go ahead and make scalping illegal, that'd be great..."
26-11-2020T00:29:05,CrRAR,haha
26-11-2020T00:29:20,AspiringNoodle,"Apparently one scalping ring got their hands on 3,500 PS5s"
26-11-2020T00:29:23,AspiringNoodle,Let me say that again
26-11-2020T00:29:26,Dadrobit,"My computer is still top of the line, my TV is big and pretty, I legit have nothing I'm looking for"
26-11-2020T00:29:31,AspiringNoodle,THREE-THOUSAND FIVE-HUNDRED PLAYSTATION FIVES

26-11-2020T00:30:08,CrRAR,whatever happened to the 1 per customer limits xD
26-11-2020T00:30:20,CrRAR,those existed for A REASON
26-11-2020T00:30:35,AspiringNoodle,"Make scalping illegal, problem solved"
26-11-2020T00:30:44,Dadrobit,"It's pretty frustrating yeah. Got a notification from Walmart one time. Managed to get a PS5 in my cart, but they were sold out by the time I clicked ""check out"""

26-11-2020T00:33:01,CrRAR,Now so many are sold online or poached
26-11-2020T00:34:40,Dadrobit,"Exactly, CrRAR. I live at the edge of the city, and there are a couple big box stores at the very edge of the boonies that might've carried stock. Now 100% of all available stock goes to pre-orders/online."

26-11-2020T00:35:30,Dadrobit,"Like, wtf guys. I get pre-orders taking the initial launch, but why the hell are you still giving 100% of the current stock to online as well?"

26-11-2020T21:41:59,SageSaga,hes never messaged me unless it was attached to like the rest of y'all
26-11-2020T21:42:07,Mediawatcher,I mean those lines usually indicate teleportation
26-11-2020T21:42:15,IraNovaki,Yes. Like the crab
26-11-2020T21:42:18,Mediawatcher,So yeah beach is over with

26-11-2020T21:42:40,SageSaga,then she vanished again
26-11-2020T21:43:00,IraNovaki,The upbeat music in a situation like this is funny
26-11-2020T21:43:15,CrimsonHelsing,"Wait, you're saying these guardians were illusions the whole time?"
26-11-2020T21:43:23,IraNovaki,o-o
26-11-2020T21:43:26,Folfy,hmm interesting
26-11-2020T21:43:35,Nekonny,Maty has been a bit of a rare sight these days
26-11-2020T21:43:36,CrRAR,"no, just like the floor Karen stepped on... very real"

26-11-2020T21:44:05,CrimsonHelsing,*being
26-11-2020T21:44:07,BadFoMo,"Maybe they were just illusions like the beach? Now that the room is broken and not just scratched, the whole thing is shuting down."
26-11-2020T21:44:10,Mediawatcher,The door is back
26-11-2020T21:44:20,IraNovaki,Nice
26-11-2020T21:44:37,IraNovaki,Then they run into Clovis's lackies
26-11-2020T21:44:42,Ordithus,never before will these characters have been so excited to see a door
26-11-2020T21:44:44,Mediawatcher,They can take them
26-11-2020T21:44:47,CrimsonHelsing,"Well, I'd hope the guardians are still real. They're kinda still needed on *other* targets"
26-11-2020T21:44:48,CrRAR,haha
26-11-2020T21:44:59,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rainehappy:*[I like door!]

26-11-2020T21:45:30,IraNovaki,I recently caught a kitten for one of my neighbors and my cat has been very mad at me
26-11-2020T21:45:37,Mediawatcher,🤷‍♂️
26-11-2020T21:45:43,IraNovaki,Hissed and growled at me for 4 hours straight

26-11-2020T21:47:15,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floraquestion: can't say I've ever heard that
26-11-2020T21:47:16,IraNovaki,I already bought the thing I want. I'm just waiting for it to arrive on Monday
26-11-2020T21:47:17,Bralios,Turkey was good. Flipped it half-way through and the skin all around is crisped up. :3
26-11-2020T21:47:20,Mediawatcher,Now they gotta save sythe so Karen can bother him endlessly
26-11-2020T21:47:38,Bralios,Wat was very happy with his candied yams. Marshmallows failed to ignite.
26-11-2020T21:47:51,IraNovaki,"Ahhh Sythe, the guy who's badly hurt with a wolf wanting to gut him"
26-11-2020T21:48:06,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, Tharkis and Bral."

26-11-2020T21:48:59,Mediawatcher,Been wondering about him
26-11-2020T21:49:00,Ordithus,he was probably trying to paint the girl one
26-11-2020T21:49:07,IraNovaki,I like how teleportation in this series looks like they're glitching
26-11-2020T21:49:12,IraNovaki,Lol
26-11-2020T21:49:17,BadFoMo,He's with Lynn.
26-11-2020T21:49:40,IraNovaki,"Now, why would he be with Lynn?"
26-11-2020T21:49:46,NezumiYuki,LOL that'd be hella amusing if Eric was indeed painting one of the female Stone Guardians!
26-11-2020T21:50:03,BadFoMo,I dunno.
26-11-2020T21:50:06,IraNovaki,"Heyyyyy, Red succeded!"
