25-06-2020T21:56:38,IronHorseComics,"lord, I had a ""fanart"" for a webcomic called ""Bakham Horror"" sketched out and I'd really like to paint it, but I suck at it and have very little idea what I'm doing"

25-06-2020T21:57:52,Ordithus,"yeah, ZRO, growing up there were tons of anthro characters in media, so they were just kinda normal"
25-06-2020T21:58:06,ShamusTheFox,Animalypmics was cool.
25-06-2020T21:58:20,IronHorseComics,"Tom, how do I not suck at painting I really want to do this piece like it. It's got a floating ghost and everything"
25-06-2020T21:59:06,w0lfmare,"Just do your best iron, and use references :cw0lfmare-Embersafe:"

25-06-2020T21:59:41,CrimsonHelsing,"I'm liking this piece so far, Tom, can't help but wonder who this is x3"
25-06-2020T21:59:45,CrRAR,yis

25-06-2020T21:59:57,IronHorseComics,...Rose if she were a cat?
25-06-2020T22:00:34,ShamusTheFox,"Oh yeah, how go the adventures of the D & D party?"
25-06-2020T22:01:25,SageSaga,the party is gonna eventually get this woman killed through no fault of Tom or Mihari's
25-06-2020T22:01:50,ShamusTheFox,"Ha ha, that's ominous!"
25-06-2020T22:01:56,CrRAR,sometimes it be like that
25-06-2020T22:01:58,Mihari,"Wait, what?!"
25-06-2020T22:02:03,IronHorseComics,and yet somehow I think they're gonna get blamed for it...
25-06-2020T22:02:17,unsteddyphoenix,So its fluffs fault...
25-06-2020T22:03:26,Combak,"Well, I'm super late, but hi all!"

25-06-2020T22:03:34,Combak,"Ooh, what's Tom working on?"
25-06-2020T22:03:37,ShamusTheFox,Evening!
25-06-2020T22:03:40,Snowmanwizard,hello
25-06-2020T22:03:40,johnnytho,hi comebak
25-06-2020T22:03:45,johnnytho,cat

25-06-2020T22:03:53,Combak,"Hi CrRAR, Ord, Keef, Shamus, Snowman, Johnny."
25-06-2020T22:03:57,Ordithus,painting a kitty
25-06-2020T22:04:14,SageSaga,they thought the assassins were after them so they thought once one of them left they would go into the house and kill the solo guy in there-
25-06-2020T22:04:44,SageSaga,instead they followed the wagon because- they arent the target- they are looking for the girl- they already checked the house- why would they think she was in there?
25-06-2020T22:05:07,ShamusTheFox,"Ah, I see."
25-06-2020T22:05:18,SageSaga,thankfully they didnt head home because they would have lead the assassins straight to the hiding place
25-06-2020T22:06:09,SageSaga,also - painting white fur is a very interesting challenge that Tom is killing XD
25-06-2020T22:06:14,ShamusTheFox,"Yeah, that would have been bad. Especially if they had time to prepare."
25-06-2020T22:07:08,ShamusTheFox,Bouncy screen!
25-06-2020T22:07:18,Ordithus,"cat with white fur, oh no my allergies"
25-06-2020T22:07:39,w0lfmare,I'm allergic to white!
25-06-2020T22:07:57,ShamusTheFox,So why is this lady a target? Or is that in the plot vault?
25-06-2020T22:08:37,SageSaga,her husbands cover was blown and now an organization is after him and his wife to silence them
25-06-2020T22:08:49,ShamusTheFox,Gotcha.
25-06-2020T22:08:55,orekh,"Wait, what's down there? Is it a armored bra?"
25-06-2020T22:09:34,SageSaga,?
25-06-2020T22:10:50,ShamusTheFox,She's pretty.
25-06-2020T22:12:53,Twokinds,White fur is so difficult
25-06-2020T22:13:01,ShamusTheFox,"Does she know secrets, or is she just collateral damage to the assassins?"
25-06-2020T22:13:02,CrimsonHelsing,how so?
25-06-2020T22:13:06,SageSaga,yep- and its looking great
25-06-2020T22:13:13,PurpleLemons,you can shade with any color :frog:
25-06-2020T22:13:37,SageSaga,you Purple!
25-06-2020T22:13:40,SageSaga,yo*
25-06-2020T22:13:45,SageSaga,Me Sage
25-06-2020T22:13:46,Mihari,Hello Purple :3
25-06-2020T22:13:46,CrimsonHelsing,pfft xD
25-06-2020T22:13:50,KeefMcDerpface,lol
25-06-2020T22:13:51,Twokinds,Yes like purple
25-06-2020T22:13:53,ShamusTheFox,Ha ha!
25-06-2020T22:14:16,CrimsonHelsing,lol!
25-06-2020T22:14:31,ShamusTheFox,Purple IS one of my favorite colors.
25-06-2020T22:14:53,CrimsonHelsing,"same, very regal, beautiful"
25-06-2020T22:15:16,Mihari,Yep! It's my favorite colour too. :3
25-06-2020T22:15:36,CrimsonHelsing,"orange is another, and many many shades of blue (very smart color, that one)"
25-06-2020T22:15:47,AspiringNoodle,Hi purps
25-06-2020T22:16:08,Nekonny,heya purple
25-06-2020T22:16:09,CrimsonHelsing,"and red, that's a badass color when it's not used in imagery that scares the living bejesus outta me lol"
25-06-2020T22:16:34,ShamusTheFox,Red is a color that can do a lot in a lot of different contexts.
25-06-2020T22:16:47,AspiringNoodle,Maybe somebody is ANGRYYYYYYYYY :ptv-angry:
25-06-2020T22:16:54,AspiringNoodle,Maybe they're passionate~
25-06-2020T22:17:05,ShamusTheFox,Or embarrassed
25-06-2020T22:17:14,AspiringNoodle,Aggressive~
25-06-2020T22:17:26,ShamusTheFox,Hot
25-06-2020T22:17:29,CrimsonHelsing,certainly doesn't do one's anxiety any favors in the more... scary contexts
25-06-2020T22:17:34,AspiringNoodle,...aggressively embarrassed
25-06-2020T22:17:35,ShamusTheFox,Seductive
25-06-2020T22:17:41,KeefMcDerpface,"lol, Noodle"
25-06-2020T22:17:50,AspiringNoodle,What?
25-06-2020T22:17:57,AspiringNoodle,I am aggressively embarrassed
25-06-2020T22:18:05,AspiringNoodle,"I don't know what about, but that's future me's problem!"
25-06-2020T22:18:25,AspiringNoodle,I like how kitty is coming along
25-06-2020T22:18:39,ShamusTheFox,I like silver/gray for a touch of distinction.
25-06-2020T22:19:03,qwe304,if white fur is hard why not draw in some other color then color shift it later (idk whjat proper term is)
25-06-2020T22:19:15,SageSaga,=_=
25-06-2020T22:19:30,SageSaga,colors dont work like that!
25-06-2020T22:20:15,qwe304,cant just do the shading as an overlay layer then change the flats later?
25-06-2020T22:20:24,SageSaga,one reason is- White isnt a color- it's a value- shading black is also very hard to do- because its black!
25-06-2020T22:21:14,AspiringNoodle,Ima disagree
25-06-2020T22:21:16,AspiringNoodle,Colors are colors
25-06-2020T22:21:18,KeefMcDerpface,"Welp, the fireworks started."
25-06-2020T22:21:25,AspiringNoodle,they do what I tell them to! :ptv-angry:
25-06-2020T22:21:31,ShamusTheFox,"Dang, not even July yet."
25-06-2020T22:21:47,johnnytho,I feel you keef
25-06-2020T22:21:50,SageSaga,theres all these little rules to how light and color affect eachother
25-06-2020T22:21:51,AspiringNoodle,"Premature ""We got through COVID"" celebrations? lol"
25-06-2020T22:22:24,SageSaga,and white is weird because it reflects all light
25-06-2020T22:22:24,johnnytho,No people celebrating mediocrity
25-06-2020T22:22:47,SageSaga,so you dont get the same kind of shade changes ya get with other colors
25-06-2020T22:22:57,Ordithus,"painting humans is complex, too.  skin has a lot going on to look right"
25-06-2020T22:23:17,KeefMcDerpface,rip my sleep btw
25-06-2020T22:23:21,ShamusTheFox,"All stuff I knew, but didn't know (from an art standpoint, just never thought about it)"
