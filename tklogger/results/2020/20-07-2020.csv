20-07-2020T02:44:16,SkeletonJester,I was 4

20-07-2020T02:46:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I gathered it was fanfic related
20-07-2020T02:46:46,SkeletonJester,The ultimate crossover
20-07-2020T02:46:57,SkeletonJester,I write a story that involves every character on OCBin
20-07-2020T02:47:08,Dadrobit,Is it still fanfic if you're writing about your own characters?
20-07-2020T02:47:10,AspiringNoodle,You're not thinking large enough
20-07-2020T02:47:19,SpazztasticKiwi,how big is your cup of coffee for that project

20-07-2020T02:48:19,SpazztasticKiwi,all stories are fanfics if you think about it
20-07-2020T02:48:21,SkeletonJester,I'm just forcing Kame to add things to OCBin at this point
20-07-2020T02:48:31,SpazztasticKiwi,little sims you made up just to torture
20-07-2020T02:48:35,AspiringNoodle,"Kame, can you add a boop button?"

20-07-2020T03:01:54,Kameloh,so you just focus on typing as fast as possible
20-07-2020T03:02:01,SkeletonJester,That's pretty wild
20-07-2020T03:02:03,Kameloh,:ckameloh-Teedus:
20-07-2020T03:02:06,SkeletonJester,I'm a really slow typer
20-07-2020T03:02:42,Kameloh,you get faster with time I think
20-07-2020T03:02:49,Kameloh,though for stories you could always go speech to text :snail:
20-07-2020T03:03:05,SkeletonJester,Just start recording my D&D sessions
20-07-2020T03:03:15,Kameloh,yeah! you could use Google Docs

20-07-2020T03:03:23,SkeletonJester,Oh gosh I was listening to a recording that my Tuesday DM did

20-07-2020T03:04:22,TeapotOfDoom,U feeling better?
20-07-2020T03:04:28,Kameloh,"yee, I had caffeine withdrawal"
20-07-2020T03:04:35,Kameloh,so I took caffeine at 10pm

20-07-2020T03:05:22,SkeletonJester,I used to take caffeine pills at Starbucks because I was so sick of coffee
20-07-2020T03:05:29,TeapotOfDoom,So now you code through the night? xD
20-07-2020T03:05:39,Kameloh,yeee
20-07-2020T03:05:47,Kameloh,"yeah, caffeine pills are great when you don't wanna drink coffee"
20-07-2020T03:05:52,Kameloh,that's what I did tonight
20-07-2020T03:06:09,SkeletonJester,Yeee
20-07-2020T03:06:20,SkeletonJester,At this point it doesn't matter for me because caffeine has next to no effect on me
20-07-2020T03:06:42,SkeletonJester,It's just a matter of morning ritual
20-07-2020T03:06:57,TeapotOfDoom,Never had enough of that stuff to really do something
20-07-2020T03:07:52,TeapotOfDoom,I drink caffeine containing tea based stuff sometimes but i don't drink coffee :cteapotofdoom-floracat:
20-07-2020T03:08:04,SkeletonJester,My dad used to give me coffee when I was way younger
20-07-2020T03:08:08,SkeletonJester,He told me it helped with allergies
20-07-2020T03:08:09,SkeletonJester,for some reason
20-07-2020T03:08:31,SkeletonJester,So I've just been drinking coffee regularly since elementary school
20-07-2020T03:08:48,TeapotOfDoom,Now i wonder if it does
20-07-2020T03:08:54,SkeletonJester,It doesn't
20-07-2020T03:08:59,SkeletonJester,I can attest to that lol
20-07-2020T03:09:03,TeapotOfDoom,Oof
20-07-2020T03:09:16,SkeletonJester,If it did my life would have been much easier haha
20-07-2020T03:09:29,TeapotOfDoom,Grass n stuff?
20-07-2020T03:09:40,SkeletonJester,"Grass, pollen, most trees"
20-07-2020T03:09:54,TeapotOfDoom,Ouch
20-07-2020T03:10:06,SkeletonJester,Teachers gave me my own box of tissues and a trash can
20-07-2020T03:10:25,TeapotOfDoom,Yeah I'm lucky I don't react to anything but some of my friends do

20-07-2020T03:10:49,SkeletonJester,"Thankfully it's only like, nasal allergies. I don't have much of any other type of reaction"

20-07-2020T03:11:13,SkeletonJester,And then I'm really allergic to Mushrooms and Shellfish
20-07-2020T03:11:20,Kameloh,maan I'm allergic to cats
20-07-2020T03:11:21,SkeletonJester,but otherwise I'm fine

20-07-2020T03:15:32,Kameloh,always suffering :snail:
20-07-2020T03:15:35,SkeletonJester,I'm allergic to A&W rootbeer!
20-07-2020T03:15:49,TeapotOfDoom,Now that's awefully specific

20-07-2020T03:16:05,TeapotOfDoom,Poor kame :cteapotofdoom-maddievibrate:
20-07-2020T03:16:19,Kameloh,sometimes I have to pause while coding or doing art just so I can scratch my arm
20-07-2020T03:16:37,Kameloh,it can get pretty bad :ckameloh-Teedus:
20-07-2020T03:17:23,TeapotOfDoom,One must suffer to create good art? Judging from the art you must suffer a lot
20-07-2020T03:17:24,SkeletonJester,My wife has eczema too and she complains about it a lot. It definitely sucks
20-07-2020T03:17:47,Kameloh,"yee, well you have to suffer at anything to get good at it"
20-07-2020T03:18:07,Kameloh,yeah it's such a pain Jester -- I have to make sure I'm dust free otherwise I'll be itching all day
20-07-2020T03:18:49,SkeletonJester,That reminds me of when I was in marching band during the summer. I have really sensitive skin that reacts to my own sweat
20-07-2020T03:19:01,SkeletonJester,"So if I start sweating even remotely, my entire body breaks out;;;"
20-07-2020T03:19:12,Kameloh,me too but it could be sweat with a mix of dust/dirt
20-07-2020T03:19:20,SkeletonJester,"Yeah, that makes sense"
20-07-2020T03:19:51,Kameloh,it's one of those topics that I don't really tell anyone about
20-07-2020T03:20:01,Kameloh,like everyday is a little bit of physical suffering
20-07-2020T03:20:11,Kameloh,but I really don't have the time to complain about it
20-07-2020T03:20:16,SkeletonJester,"Yeah, it's kind of hard to bring up cause it's kind of like"
20-07-2020T03:20:17,SkeletonJester,yeah
20-07-2020T03:20:17,Kameloh,since I've gotten used to the pain
20-07-2020T03:20:29,SkeletonJester,"Yeah, that's how my wife is with her chronic pain and fatigue"
20-07-2020T03:20:47,SkeletonJester,"It gets exhausting after a while explaining like, yes, I am in constant pain and have no escape from my suffering"
20-07-2020T03:20:52,SkeletonJester,This is nothing new to me
20-07-2020T03:20:54,SkeletonJester,This is just life now
20-07-2020T03:21:23,SkeletonJester,Getting caught up on it or complaining about it doesn't really fix anything and just makes me feel worse about it
20-07-2020T03:21:34,Kameloh,yeah exactly XD
20-07-2020T03:21:50,TeapotOfDoom,I can't even start to imagine
20-07-2020T03:22:09,TeapotOfDoom,Best of luck to you too so you get rid of it some day
20-07-2020T03:22:33,Kameloh,sometimes you look at people with smooth skin and wonder what it's like
20-07-2020T03:22:43,SkeletonJester,Mood
20-07-2020T03:22:57,Kameloh,"people can easily open doors, pick up clothes, and do a lot of things with their hands and not worry about touching their face or arms"
20-07-2020T03:23:13,Kameloh,like I'm pretty sure I wash my hands 20+ times a day
20-07-2020T03:23:49,SkeletonJester,"sitting here like ""Damn, must be nice to just... do things without caring if I inhale a little dust."""

20-07-2020T03:25:37,SkeletonJester,They've kind grown on me
20-07-2020T03:26:01,SkeletonJester,But now we have Peanut so that probably wont happen unless we get a house or something
20-07-2020T03:26:17,TeapotOfDoom,Peanut?
20-07-2020T03:26:26,SkeletonJester,"Ye, he's my youngest dog son"
20-07-2020T03:26:33,SkeletonJester,Taco is the other one
20-07-2020T03:26:36,TeapotOfDoom,Ohhh

20-07-2020T03:27:54,SkeletonJester,Let me see if I can find a good picture of them together
20-07-2020T03:29:06,TeapotOfDoom,Had a dog till last year. My parents wanted to get a new one but the woman who we got our last one from said the two dogs who were supposed to didn't get any puppies
20-07-2020T03:29:39,TeapotOfDoom,So another six months of waiting
20-07-2020T03:29:51,SkeletonJester,I put their pictures in the discord chat
20-07-2020T03:31:12,SkeletonJester,"We were originally gonna name Peanut, Oatmeal but he wouldn't respond to Oatmeal"
20-07-2020T03:31:20,SkeletonJester,He responded to Peanut immediately though
20-07-2020T03:31:32,Kameloh,peanut is a cute name!
20-07-2020T03:31:32,TeapotOfDoom,Aw lil cuties
20-07-2020T03:32:07,SkeletonJester,THey're both Papillon/Chihuahua mixes
20-07-2020T03:32:14,SkeletonJester,Peanut's got a little terrier in him though
20-07-2020T03:32:37,SkeletonJester,"Very smart, and very bratty"
20-07-2020T03:32:42,TeapotOfDoom,Sounds like quite the active bunch
20-07-2020T03:33:09,SkeletonJester,"Taco is very chill, Peanut is a little more rowdy because of all the puppy still in him"
20-07-2020T03:33:16,TeapotOfDoom,Ours was a golden. Getting a golden again
20-07-2020T03:33:41,TeapotOfDoom,He was the physical manifestation of tranquility
20-07-2020T03:34:17,SkeletonJester,I hear most are. Kind of like a calm active mix
20-07-2020T03:34:42,TeapotOfDoom,Yeah. He was like
20-07-2020T03:34:53,TeapotOfDoom,My dad described it like this
20-07-2020T03:35:23,TeapotOfDoom,"If someone were to break into the house, he would have lead them to the fridge"
20-07-2020T03:35:32,SkeletonJester,lol
20-07-2020T03:35:34,Kameloh,:ckameloh-Teedus:
20-07-2020T03:35:47,SkeletonJester,Taco is very feisty
20-07-2020T03:35:50,SkeletonJester,He doesn't like anyone
20-07-2020T03:36:15,SkeletonJester,But he's also a rescue - came from an abusive home and then was picked up off the streets so
20-07-2020T03:36:39,TeapotOfDoom,Yeah our neighbors dog who is also my great aunt is like of coffeine
20-07-2020T03:36:47,SkeletonJester,Peanut is just a puppy we bought from a local dog breeder
20-07-2020T03:36:57,TeapotOfDoom,Only really listens to me or my dad
20-07-2020T03:37:27,TeapotOfDoom,Barks constantly :cteapotofdoom-wolfstare:
20-07-2020T03:37:30,SkeletonJester,"Taco doesn't really listen. He knows a fair few commands and tricks, but he only does them when he wants"
20-07-2020T03:37:35,Dadrobit,Back again for a bit
20-07-2020T03:37:36,SkeletonJester,Unless its kisses
20-07-2020T03:37:38,SkeletonJester,he loves to kiss
20-07-2020T03:37:44,TeapotOfDoom,Aw
20-07-2020T03:37:51,TeapotOfDoom,Hi dad
20-07-2020T03:38:17,SkeletonJester,Peanut I think is still too uh
20-07-2020T03:38:19,SkeletonJester,dumb
20-07-2020T03:38:20,SkeletonJester,To learn
20-07-2020T03:38:30,TeapotOfDoom,Lol
20-07-2020T03:38:45,SkeletonJester,He did learn kisses very fast though
20-07-2020T03:39:01,TeapotOfDoom,Who would have thought xD
20-07-2020T03:39:14,SkeletonJester,Although it
20-07-2020T03:39:24,SkeletonJester,it's a 50/50 on if he just kisses or if he sneaks a bite in too
20-07-2020T03:40:17,TeapotOfDoom,O_O
20-07-2020T03:40:24,TeapotOfDoom,Nibble nibble

20-07-2020T03:44:50,TeapotOfDoom,Yes my calculations were correct
20-07-2020T03:45:04,Dadrobit,3 more hours and work is done with me.
20-07-2020T03:45:22,TeapotOfDoom,Sweet
20-07-2020T03:45:36,TeapotOfDoom,Final study day
20-07-2020T03:45:47,Dadrobit,"3.5 technically, but who really works that last half hour?"
20-07-2020T03:45:54,TeapotOfDoom,Tomorrow is the last exam before summer break :cteapotofdoom-ember_dab:

20-07-2020T03:47:08,TeapotOfDoom,I know exactly what's gonna happen on thursday tho
20-07-2020T03:47:16,Kameloh,hmm?
20-07-2020T03:47:32,TeapotOfDoom,I will sit around with nothing to do stressed out that i should use the time to study
20-07-2020T03:47:39,TeapotOfDoom,But there is nothing to study
20-07-2020T03:47:47,TeapotOfDoom,So i will stress out more
20-07-2020T03:48:20,TeapotOfDoom,Takes a few days for that nonsense to subside
20-07-2020T03:52:17,TeapotOfDoom,I see you got that kana going
20-07-2020T03:52:28,Kameloh,何 :snail:

20-07-2020T03:53:07,Kameloh,gotta expose yourself to more kanji
20-07-2020T03:53:12,TeapotOfDoom,My kata is not really good yet tho xD
20-07-2020T03:53:22,TeapotOfDoom,My room is full of kanji

20-07-2020T03:53:47,TeapotOfDoom,You should see my door xD
20-07-2020T03:54:48,TeapotOfDoom,Ye i want to learn a bit about grammar tho. Duo only goes so far on that. Do you know any good ressources for that possibly?
20-07-2020T03:55:29,Kameloh,nope! it's been too long since I've studied so I don't know what's useful nowadays
20-07-2020T03:55:57,Dadrobit,:( I've lost like 99% of my Japanese.
20-07-2020T03:56:12,TeapotOfDoom,You spoke it as well?

20-07-2020T03:56:33,TeapotOfDoom,School language dad?
20-07-2020T03:57:03,Dadrobit,I took a year of Japanese in college with my brother many years ago so we could play Monster Hunter on PS3.
20-07-2020T03:57:07,Twokinds,ohio

20-07-2020T03:59:02,Kameloh,XD
20-07-2020T03:59:24,Dadrobit,Brb again
20-07-2020T03:59:26,Twokinds,"Then you remember more than me, Dadrobit."
20-07-2020T03:59:38,Twokinds,I took a whole semester of Japanese. It's gone now.
20-07-2020T04:00:03,Kameloh,do you remember how to write Tom in katakana?
20-07-2020T04:00:43,Twokinds,"No, I can't recall most of the alphabet anymore."

20-07-2020T04:01:54,Kameloh,wb!
20-07-2020T04:01:54,TeapotOfDoom,My spelling's shit xD
20-07-2020T04:02:07,Dadrobit,"I can barely English anymore, much less Japanese."
20-07-2020T04:02:09,Kameloh,"no it's fine, it's just it's pronounced konnichiwa but you write it as konnichiha"
20-07-2020T04:02:21,TeapotOfDoom,I know right
20-07-2020T04:02:28,Kameloh,it's weird :ckameloh-naokigrin:
20-07-2020T04:03:13,TeapotOfDoom,For the longest time i thought は was わ anyway
20-07-2020T04:03:32,Kameloh,well は is a particle
20-07-2020T04:03:37,Kameloh,名前はトムです
20-07-2020T04:03:39,TeapotOfDoom,Until they changed the tts engine on duo
20-07-2020T04:03:43,Kameloh,name ha TOMU desu
20-07-2020T04:04:11,TeapotOfDoom,I definitely need to look up japanese grammar
20-07-2020T04:04:13,Kameloh,it's a bit confusing XD
20-07-2020T04:05:08,TeapotOfDoom,So is は exclusively used as a particle?
20-07-2020T04:05:24,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I struggled bad in class. Probably my hardest time in college was trying to learn Japanese."
20-07-2020T04:05:25,Kameloh,well have you gone through particle lessons?
20-07-2020T04:05:32,TeapotOfDoom,Nope
20-07-2020T04:05:38,TeapotOfDoom,No grammar on duo
20-07-2020T04:05:51,TeapotOfDoom,That's why i asked earlier
20-07-2020T04:05:57,Kameloh,yee you could look on youtube -- there should be a few japanese tutorials on how to use particles
20-07-2020T04:06:10,TeapotOfDoom,Ima look later
20-07-2020T04:06:51,Dadrobit,"Most nerve-wracking time was having to hold a conversation with the professor in front of the class while it's being recorded for review. I don't get stage fright, but for some reason that ruined me."
20-07-2020T04:06:57,TeapotOfDoom,Duo is nice but the rate of progress is a bit slow. Vocab is fine but i still can only talk about what I'm doing and what i did
20-07-2020T04:07:04,Kameloh,oh geez dadrobit XD
20-07-2020T04:07:18,TeapotOfDoom,Oof dad
20-07-2020T04:07:45,TeapotOfDoom,I took a japanese course next semester
20-07-2020T04:08:03,Dadrobit,Still did better than most in the class fwiw. Professor was just a bit of a taskmaster.
20-07-2020T04:08:05,TeapotOfDoom,At this rate i wonder if that even makes sense xD
20-07-2020T04:08:24,TeapotOfDoom,Probably still
20-07-2020T04:08:37,Dadrobit,And I had the benefit of a brother in the class to work off of and practice with all the time.
20-07-2020T04:08:38,Kameloh,it's great though
20-07-2020T04:08:45,Kameloh,imagine all the manga you can read :crocodile:

20-07-2020T04:10:12,TeapotOfDoom,Oh xD
20-07-2020T04:10:16,Twokinds,Wish I could just know Japanese without all that pesky learning.
20-07-2020T04:10:17,TeapotOfDoom,Sry my bad
20-07-2020T04:10:20,Dadrobit,Lol
20-07-2020T04:10:22,Kameloh,XD
20-07-2020T04:10:35,Kameloh,they probably have photos -> translation software already available
20-07-2020T04:10:43,TeapotOfDoom,There is
20-07-2020T04:10:46,Kameloh,some people probably use those to read mangas
20-07-2020T04:10:52,TeapotOfDoom,Google translate can do that
20-07-2020T04:10:55,Dadrobit,That would be so time consuming...
20-07-2020T04:11:06,Twokinds,"Man, it's never going to work well enough until AI can understand context."
20-07-2020T04:11:28,TeapotOfDoom,Yeah some translations are... wonky
20-07-2020T04:11:42,Kameloh,"true, but you could always fill out the errors with your own interpretation :ckameloh-Teedus:"
20-07-2020T04:11:48,Twokinds,Although it is surprising sometimes how well it does work now.
20-07-2020T04:12:20,Twokinds,I once used google translate to pretty accurately translate a box of medicine.
20-07-2020T04:12:31,Twokinds,That was in Korean.

20-07-2020T04:13:01,Kameloh,oh that's really cool -- I've never tried google translate for stuff like that
20-07-2020T04:13:13,Kameloh,was it from your phone or an image on PC?
20-07-2020T04:13:21,Twokinds,Phone.
20-07-2020T04:13:22,Dadrobit,Go in thinking it's ibuprofen. An hour later it proves to be laxatives...

20-07-2020T04:13:33,Twokinds,You can just point your camera at it and it'll translate the image live.
20-07-2020T04:13:34,TeapotOfDoom,Yeah was about to say really cool that it worked that well. Prolly still wouldn't trust it
20-07-2020T04:13:55,Kameloh,the trick teapot is to mostly learn Japanese and then use your phone to translate the mangas :snail:
20-07-2020T04:14:07,TeapotOfDoom,Heh

20-07-2020T05:33:16,Kameloh,yeah it's great!
20-07-2020T05:33:51,TeapotOfDoom,ye what i thought about was if it were possible to make this part of character creation modular
20-07-2020T05:34:21,TeapotOfDoom,so insteat of adding more and more data fields one coule create a template of all the fields needed and add as required
20-07-2020T05:34:38,TeapotOfDoom,like add a card rpg with all that data
20-07-2020T05:34:45,TeapotOfDoom,but be able to create custom ones
20-07-2020T05:35:05,Kameloh,custom ones?
20-07-2020T05:35:27,Kameloh,like this? I made it so you can already add custom inputs and textareas
20-07-2020T05:35:45,TeapotOfDoom,ohh yea exactly that
20-07-2020T05:36:01,Dadrobit,"Kame, so good"
20-07-2020T05:36:14,TeapotOfDoom,"but create another card instead of ""Custom"" and save that card as a preset?"
20-07-2020T05:36:37,Kameloh,"hmm, not sure -- I'd have to seen an example :thinking:"
20-07-2020T05:36:40,TeapotOfDoom,like if i were to create a customized version of the RPG card and then just add that to all rpg characters
20-07-2020T05:37:14,Kameloh,you mean like a template with the RPG stuff?
20-07-2020T05:37:19,TeapotOfDoom,for example
20-07-2020T05:37:40,TeapotOfDoom,you could declutter the character information and only add cards if need be
20-07-2020T05:38:00,TeapotOfDoom,ima write it down and make a design mock up after the exam

20-07-2020T16:35:11,Photonoko,yeah been fun to play around with
20-07-2020T16:35:33,Photonoko,I'm TOTALLY not biased but if you do a raffle you should decide by marble race
20-07-2020T16:35:47,Kameloh,how ... how would one do a marble race raffle XD
20-07-2020T16:36:19,Photonoko,"It's a free steam game, you just enter the names of the people who enter and run the race"
20-07-2020T16:36:23,Maku,yes do a marble race so I can suffer here too :cmaku-cells:

20-07-2020T16:38:29,Photonoko,I wish
20-07-2020T16:38:46,PurpleLemons,"I remember I won one of the races, sadly not for pho raffle"
20-07-2020T16:38:49,Maku,it has twitch integration
20-07-2020T16:38:54,Kameloh,okay I definitely need to try this sometime
20-07-2020T16:38:56,Kameloh,it looks amazing
20-07-2020T16:39:00,Maku,for picarto you have to enter the names manually
20-07-2020T16:39:03,Photonoko,We just use google forms and import a .csv of the names
20-07-2020T16:39:45,SkeletonJester,This whole concept is just hilarious to me
20-07-2020T16:39:48,Kameloh,how many marbles have you had in your raffle?
20-07-2020T16:39:57,Kameloh,like the highest amount at a time

20-07-2020T17:08:26,SkeletonJester,It looksgood!
20-07-2020T17:08:49,SkeletonJester,I would maybe see if you can assine a serif font to the text area only maybe?
20-07-2020T17:08:51,Kameloh,you should be able to edit the story from the post
20-07-2020T17:08:53,SkeletonJester,Just for readabilities sake
20-07-2020T17:09:05,Kameloh,"hmm, what's a good story font?"
20-07-2020T17:09:08,SkeletonJester,Wow I can't type
20-07-2020T17:09:11,Kameloh,maybe something from google fonts
20-07-2020T17:09:16,SkeletonJester,"Uh, let me seeeeeee"
20-07-2020T17:09:24,TeapotOfDoom,Roboto
20-07-2020T17:09:27,SkeletonJester,What fonts do you use on the site?
20-07-2020T17:09:29,TeapotOfDoom,:cteapotofdoom-kumipog:
20-07-2020T17:09:52,SkeletonJester,Roboto is a sans serif font
20-07-2020T17:10:09,TeapotOfDoom,yes
20-07-2020T17:10:15,SkeletonJester,Most Sans serif fonts aren't toooo great just cause they don't have much connecting the words or letters
20-07-2020T17:10:16,TeapotOfDoom,sans serif best
20-07-2020T17:10:35,SkeletonJester,"Since your eyes don't focus on individual letters, more their structure and grouping"
20-07-2020T17:10:37,Kameloh,I dunno anything about writing so I dunno what looks good XD
20-07-2020T17:11:08,SkeletonJester,I'll look at a few when I'm off work or on lunch
20-07-2020T17:11:17,SkeletonJester,atm I'm on the last bit of my break haha
20-07-2020T17:11:18,TeapotOfDoom,also spacing?
20-07-2020T17:11:21,Kameloh,"yee, I was thinking maybe giving an option to the user"
20-07-2020T17:11:27,Kameloh,so they can pick a font for their story post
20-07-2020T17:11:29,SkeletonJester,That might be a good idea
20-07-2020T17:11:37,Kameloh,but it would have to be from google fonts
20-07-2020T17:11:40,SkeletonJester,Ye
20-07-2020T17:11:53,SkeletonJester,Google fonts has a lot to work with so that would probably be fine
20-07-2020T17:11:57,SkeletonJester,Most fonts I use are from there hue
20-07-2020T17:12:27,SkeletonJester,"The spacing is a bit tight, but I don't think you can really do anything about that, afaik"
20-07-2020T17:12:37,Kameloh,there's letter-spacing in css
20-07-2020T17:12:43,Kameloh,letter-spacing: 0.2px
20-07-2020T17:12:44,TeapotOfDoom,:eyes:
20-07-2020T17:12:46,Kameloh,or something like that
20-07-2020T17:12:48,SkeletonJester,Hmm
20-07-2020T17:12:58,TeapotOfDoom,hm maybe make that a bit bigger?
20-07-2020T17:13:23,SkeletonJester,try .35
20-07-2020T17:13:24,TeapotOfDoom,holy shit
20-07-2020T17:13:35,TeapotOfDoom,yeah that looks good
20-07-2020T17:13:38,SkeletonJester,Yee
20-07-2020T17:13:40,TeapotOfDoom,0.5
20-07-2020T17:13:48,SkeletonJester,.35 looks good

20-07-2020T17:14:03,Kameloh,how about now?
20-07-2020T17:14:17,SkeletonJester,"Yeah, that's solid"
20-07-2020T17:14:25,Kameloh,you should add your characters on the side :snail:

20-07-2020T17:16:16,Kameloh,hmm how am I gonna do the fonts :thinking:
20-07-2020T17:18:35,SkeletonJester,No idea hue
20-07-2020T17:18:58,Kameloh,I have an idea
20-07-2020T17:18:59,SkeletonJester,"That's not something you could assign in the story text itself, I imagine"
20-07-2020T17:19:03,Kameloh,but it might be complex :cat:
20-07-2020T17:19:18,Kameloh,I could make it so users can specify the exact google font?
20-07-2020T17:19:30,Kameloh,it would look like Grenze+Gotisch:wght@500
20-07-2020T17:19:33,SkeletonJester,"Yeah, that's what I was sorta wondering"
20-07-2020T17:19:53,SkeletonJester,It wouldn't be too awful I don't think
20-07-2020T17:20:04,Kameloh,:thinking:
20-07-2020T17:21:18,Kameloh,though for UI purposes
20-07-2020T17:21:28,Kameloh,it might be easier to just have the user pick from a list of pre-selected fonts
20-07-2020T17:21:48,SkeletonJester,"Yeah, it would probably be easiest"
20-07-2020T17:23:06,SkeletonJester,You should definitely have Crimson Pro as an option
20-07-2020T17:23:09,SkeletonJester,:snail:
20-07-2020T17:23:13,Kameloh,got a link to that?
20-07-2020T17:23:22,TeapotOfDoom,and also make most sense for page readability and usability
20-07-2020T17:23:44,SkeletonJester,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Crimson+Pro?query=crimson+pro
20-07-2020T17:23:57,Kameloh,oh that's a cool font :eyes:

20-07-2020T17:24:56,Kameloh,"yee, I might ask for a list later"
20-07-2020T17:25:10,SkeletonJester,I can definitely do that
20-07-2020T17:25:15,Kameloh,an alternative approach would have
20-07-2020T17:25:19,Kameloh,a template editor for stories
20-07-2020T17:25:30,Kameloh,so maybe users can format the background and text alltogether and reuse the same template
20-07-2020T17:25:55,Kameloh,story.. templates.. :ckameloh-naokipaper:
20-07-2020T17:26:24,SkeletonJester,That would be neat

20-07-2020T17:28:56,SkeletonJester,Most of the specifics you'd want to do for text formatting I don't think you can actually do in CSS or HTML anyway
20-07-2020T17:29:10,Kameloh,probably just gonna use custom fonts and maybe one day a user inputted css
20-07-2020T17:29:14,SkeletonJester,"Like justification, auto-hyphens, glyph scaling, etc etc"
