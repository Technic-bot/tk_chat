23-02-2020T22:27:16,AspiringNoodle,Starting tomorrow the anti-fun belt goes on for me
23-02-2020T22:27:37,AspiringNoodle,"Gonna REALLY clamp down on my WoW playtime and start making ""hard"" decisions regarding media consumption"
23-02-2020T22:27:48,JojoF2415,Im making sure the background music is in sync
23-02-2020T22:28:17,AspiringNoodle,"I remember watching a timelapse of a few frames from Vivziepop's ""Die Young"" animation"
23-02-2020T22:28:31,AspiringNoodle,"She played ""Flight of the Valkyries"" and it was effing EPIC XD"
23-02-2020T22:29:11,JojoF2415,Its a drawing timelapse
23-02-2020T22:29:29,JojoF2415,I made that flora drawing by hand not digital
23-02-2020T22:31:19,JojoF2415,The drawing my cat ruined was made when i was 13 years old
23-02-2020T22:33:33,JojoF2415,Drawing time lapse is in sync with music
23-02-2020T22:34:57,AspiringNoodle,"Jojo, pro tip, avoid retail"
23-02-2020T22:35:54,SonOfGoku,Sorry hear about your drawing Jojo
23-02-2020T22:36:41,AspiringNoodle,"Stupid animals, y u no smarter?!?"
23-02-2020T22:36:50,AspiringNoodle,"Oh yeah, because then you wouldn't be as cute / pet friendly ._."
23-02-2020T22:38:33,SonOfGoku,Why are you working a 5th day Noodle?
23-02-2020T22:45:48,AspiringNoodle,Because (joys of retail) one of our coworkers quit 2 weeks ago with no notice.  Something I'm learning is quite common in the industry
23-02-2020T22:46:19,AspiringNoodle,"Another coworker got her CNA and is moving onto a MUCH better job.  And she's not able to finish out the week (not sure if she quit, was fired, or if the new job is pulling her in early)"
23-02-2020T22:46:56,AspiringNoodle,"But this is week 3 of me working 4 days (really, this should count as full-time employment since I work over 30 hours)"
23-02-2020T22:47:06,AspiringNoodle,And now a 5th day is getting tacked on
23-02-2020T22:48:26,AspiringNoodle,"To be fair, I agreed to do the 5th day because the store is already stretched to a breaking point."
23-02-2020T22:48:41,AspiringNoodle,"I *can* work that 5th day, just don't expect me to enjoy it :ptv-hearts:"
23-02-2020T22:48:59,SonOfGoku,Well at least your making more money
23-02-2020T22:50:05,AspiringNoodle,"Yay for feet-hurting, back-aching, people-shoved-in-your-face-all-day, not-enough-time-to-do-everything, just-above-minimum-wage money :ptv-hearts:"
23-02-2020T22:51:15,AspiringNoodle,Sorry for the vent ._.
23-02-2020T22:51:25,SonOfGoku,Don't worry about it
23-02-2020T22:51:43,SonOfGoku,I just finished my first day of finals
23-02-2020T22:52:17,AspiringNoodle,"I miss school, haha"
23-02-2020T22:52:24,AspiringNoodle,"I'm a very passive person by nature, it seems"
23-02-2020T22:52:54,SonOfGoku,"Here's a fun fact, I took two finals earlier today but then took a midterm for another class afterwards"
23-02-2020T22:53:26,AspiringNoodle,Wish I was subbed to Kameh right now
23-02-2020T22:53:31,AspiringNoodle,"He has the perfect emote for that, lol"
23-02-2020T22:53:44,AspiringNoodle,D:
23-02-2020T22:54:12,SonOfGoku,The class I took the midterm for has its final tomorrow and I have two term projects that need to be completed by wednesday that were assigned last week
23-02-2020T22:54:27,AspiringNoodle,"Jesus, what are you in school for?"
23-02-2020T22:54:46,SonOfGoku,Architectural Engineering
23-02-2020T22:55:36,AspiringNoodle,cool!
23-02-2020T22:56:04,AspiringNoodle,I went for computer science with a computer graphics concetration (funny how now that I'm working at a gas station I have a sudden interest in revisiting my old subjects...)
23-02-2020T22:56:31,SonOfGoku,My professor is very disorganized to the point where she skipped her senior design meeting the day before they were supposed to present to write our midterm
23-02-2020T22:57:10,SonOfGoku,Computer science stuff is fun
23-02-2020T22:57:42,SonOfGoku,My school just opened a new building with an expensive supercomputer inside
23-02-2020T22:58:15,SonOfGoku,"It was neat to look at, I even was able to go inside the computer for one of my classes"
23-02-2020T22:59:04,AspiringNoodle,Want me to sum up CG in two words?
23-02-2020T22:59:13,SonOfGoku,Sure
23-02-2020T23:00:35,AspiringNoodle,Vector Math
23-02-2020T23:01:36,SonOfGoku,"That doesn't sound fun, reminds me of my first physics class"
23-02-2020T23:04:00,AspiringNoodle,A vector is an object with both magnitude and direction
23-02-2020T23:07:46,JojoF2415,for some reason my phone won't let me airdrop to my computer. It has worked before.
23-02-2020T23:09:59,JojoF2415,I would have been easier to just airdrop the videos to my computer
23-02-2020T23:10:11,JojoF2415,I just did everything on drive
23-02-2020T23:10:44,AspiringNoodle,"That reminds me, I need to buy a NAS or something to backup my computer"
23-02-2020T23:10:52,AspiringNoodle,I keep living dangerously and have 0 backups for anything ._.
23-02-2020T23:15:36,JojoF2415,Time for video editing
23-02-2020T23:36:00,JojoF2415,Im almost done
23-02-2020T23:54:44,JojoF2415,Ending clips are terrible. I‚Äôll finish it tomorrow.
