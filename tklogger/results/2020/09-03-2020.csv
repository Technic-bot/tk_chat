09-03-2020T21:04:52,CrRAR,My company's one of those megalomaniacal conglomo's and every day is like a new travel thing you can't do.
09-03-2020T21:05:38,CrRAR,"""no flying to this one country"""
09-03-2020T21:05:53,CrRAR,"""no flying to ANY country"""
09-03-2020T21:06:12,Ordithus,"Mine mostly deals with China, so that part ended a while ago"
09-03-2020T21:06:21,CrRAR,Oh good
09-03-2020T21:06:44,Ordithus,"They brought everyone back over stateside, no one got it"
09-03-2020T21:06:56,CrRAR,Phew
09-03-2020T21:08:14,CrRAR,It's like in a action movie when someone slides harrowingly under a blast door.
09-03-2020T21:08:26,CrRAR,Makes it by a hair.

09-03-2020T21:44:18,Dadrobit,:/ First cases of Covid popping up in my town. One death so far...
09-03-2020T21:45:23,Dadrobit,"My company: ""You're all young strong men and women, just bring your own sanitizer to work. In the event that you do get sick, don't worry, you'll survive it."""
09-03-2020T21:45:40,Dadrobit,Paraphrased of course.
09-03-2020T21:47:00,Dadrobit,"In other news, the company chili cook off is stil a-go!"
09-03-2020T21:47:35,CrRAR,\o/
09-03-2020T21:47:49,CrRAR,Yay for large gatherings!

09-03-2020T21:49:25,CrRAR,strength in numbers or something
09-03-2020T21:52:41,Ordithus,"Yikes.  Stay safe, dadro."
09-03-2020T21:58:30,CrRAR,Company update at 7 says no state-to-state travel apparently. >:
09-03-2020T21:58:45,CrRAR,I... cross a border commuting to work. I might be getting an indefinite vacation guys! xD
09-03-2020T22:02:27,Ordithus,half the people at my company commute across state lines too!
09-03-2020T22:03:13,Ordithus,Fortunately I am surrounded by asocial nordic types
09-03-2020T22:03:21,Dadrobit,"I actually have no idea what my company is thinking about doing for this if we get hit. We are short staffed as it is, having even 3 people out for a week would actually destroy us."
09-03-2020T22:03:33,CrRAR,"Yeah, it's probably referring to business tasks travel."
09-03-2020T22:04:15,CrRAR,"Yeah, most places would be toast how there's no role overlap anymore."
09-03-2020T22:04:18,Dadrobit,Since we need every position staffed 24/7 and we already have over 100+ hours of overtime a week.
09-03-2020T22:04:39,Ordithus,woah what
09-03-2020T22:04:54,CrRAR,So much feels like EVERYTHINGs set up to fail.
09-03-2020T22:05:04,Dadrobit,Lemme check the last schedule report real quick.
09-03-2020T22:05:22,CrRAR,Our place has taken crazy cost cutting shortcuts too.
09-03-2020T22:06:16,CrRAR,"It's like it was a race to the bottom, and they crashed through the floor."
09-03-2020T22:06:26,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-keifacepalm:
09-03-2020T22:07:24,Dadrobit,152 hours short.
09-03-2020T22:07:27,Dadrobit,Fucking nuts
09-03-2020T22:07:44,Dadrobit,EVERYONE is already doing OT already to cover this.
09-03-2020T22:07:48,Ordithus,between how many people?
09-03-2020T22:08:28,Dadrobit,"30-ish, but there a position specific duties that need filling as well that makes it even more complicated."
09-03-2020T22:08:37,Dadrobit,are*
09-03-2020T22:09:40,Dadrobit,And speaking of. Time for me to head in. o7
09-03-2020T22:10:02,Ordithus,"See ya, stay away from anyone with a cough.  Spray them with lysol"
09-03-2020T22:12:21,CrRAR,"When everyone looks around and nods in uninamity that the ship is sinking, the ship dun sunk."
09-03-2020T22:12:39,CrRAR,See ya robit
09-03-2020T22:12:46,CrRAR,Godspeed o7
09-03-2020T23:47:30,AspiringNoodle,work is more or less the same way
09-03-2020T23:47:53,AspiringNoodle,"We have people getting the amount of, if not more, hours than they were asking for."
09-03-2020T23:48:29,AspiringNoodle,"Personally, I'm happy being capped at 3 days a week.  2 days might make money a bit tight since I'd more or less be making the same amount as my expenses, but it would free up more time to learn stuff"
09-03-2020T23:51:06,AspiringNoodle,"But yeah, my manager is wondering if he should hire anyone else at the moment, and I'm like YES."
09-03-2020T23:52:04,AspiringNoodle,"Suffice to say, Corona is definitely showing how short-sighted most businesses are ;)"
