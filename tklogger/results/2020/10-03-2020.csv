10-03-2020T16:13:27,Twokinds,Have I ever said how big exactly maddie is before
10-03-2020T16:15:56,TerraTheWizard,hmm
10-03-2020T16:17:05,TerraTheWizard,i don't think so
10-03-2020T16:17:42,IronHorseComics,nyet
10-03-2020T16:20:27,Twokinds,What would be your best guess
10-03-2020T16:32:00,TerraTheWizard,"around 4'9""/4'10"""
10-03-2020T16:32:12,TerraTheWizard,totally scientific measuring stick https://imgur.com/YUY8cM6
10-03-2020T16:33:52,InTheLionsDen,"Yes, I would say around or just under 5'. Keith is 5'5"" according to a Male Bust and Height Chart (2013) and in a more recent vote incentive Uncovered Madeline appears to come up to about his eyebrows so around 5'."
10-03-2020T16:34:34,TerraTheWizard,i made that image in mspaint
10-03-2020T16:34:50,TerraTheWizard,because i made it better in krita but when i tried to export it it only exported the measuring line
10-03-2020T16:34:56,TerraTheWizard,because krita is a potato

10-03-2020T16:37:31,Twokinds,Hm...
10-03-2020T16:38:14,Twokinds,I think 5' might be reasonable
10-03-2020T16:38:52,Twokinds,Maybe 4'10
10-03-2020T16:38:57,Twokinds,Somewhere around there
10-03-2020T16:39:53,Twokinds,"Yeah, 4'10 she's like almost a head shorter than Keith"
10-03-2020T16:40:44,Twokinds,Pretty tiny
10-03-2020T16:43:12,TerraTheWizard,pocket basitin
10-03-2020T16:43:15,InTheLionsDen,And Keith isn't a tall one either so it sounds about right.
