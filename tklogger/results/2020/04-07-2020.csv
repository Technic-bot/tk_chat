04-07-2020T01:45:41,AspiringNoodle,So fireworks make Tom sleepy?
04-07-2020T01:45:52,AspiringNoodle,c:
04-07-2020T02:02:37,SpazztasticKiwi,he fizzled himself out
04-07-2020T02:11:52,AspiringNoodle,Looks like sleep is calling to me...
04-07-2020T02:11:59,AspiringNoodle,"Time to join Tom, I guess :snake:"
04-07-2020T05:32:36,AspiringNoodle,I didn't go to sleep for long ._.
04-07-2020T05:32:46,AspiringNoodle,"Was down for an hour, then noticed Tron: Legacy playing"
04-07-2020T05:34:53,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
04-07-2020T05:35:46,AspiringNoodle,Hooooooooooiiiiiiiiii Terraaaaaaaaaa
04-07-2020T05:47:59,TerraTheWizard,ahoy
04-07-2020T05:48:30,TerraTheWizard,i would have been able to watch some of the stream tonight but my work days changed :ctwokinds-sadtrace2:
04-07-2020T05:49:29,TerraTheWizard,and they're probably gonna be different next week too
04-07-2020T05:50:29,AspiringNoodle,"Ugh, I keep forgetting, what's your career again?"
04-07-2020T05:50:36,AspiringNoodle,I need to work on remembering this stuff >_>
04-07-2020T05:53:03,TerraTheWizard,home shop stuff at asda (walmart)
04-07-2020T05:53:25,AspiringNoodle,"Oh yay, retail"
04-07-2020T05:53:32,TerraTheWizard,2am-8am
04-07-2020T05:53:49,AspiringNoodle,"Aka: Shitty pay, shitty benefits, shitty work environment, no schedule stability"
04-07-2020T05:53:53,AspiringNoodle,Yaaaaaaaaay~
04-07-2020T05:54:09,TerraTheWizard,but actual work so :ctwokinds-adiracoin:
04-07-2020T05:54:13,AspiringNoodle,Ha
04-07-2020T05:54:32,AspiringNoodle,"I was super cheery yesterday despite being overburdened, lol"
04-07-2020T05:54:37,TerraTheWizard,it's double pay before 5am though so
04-07-2020T05:54:44,AspiringNoodle,Because I don't work for the next week
04-07-2020T05:55:20,AspiringNoodle,"Can tell you right now, it's gonna get REAL old if the store only schedules 2 cashiers per shift now that we're in summer"
04-07-2020T05:55:30,TerraTheWizard,hooee
04-07-2020T05:55:44,AspiringNoodle,We're a small store
04-07-2020T05:56:04,AspiringNoodle,"While I was a little saddened at going from 3 cashiers to 2 shortly after starting last year, it makes sense"
04-07-2020T05:56:13,AspiringNoodle,"In the winter, people just don't move around as much"
04-07-2020T05:56:39,AspiringNoodle,"But summer, your azz better be scheduling 3 cashiers per shift, or prepare for NOTHING to get done."
04-07-2020T05:57:26,AspiringNoodle,"Friday / Saturday, I rung out $3,900 in sales between my 2 registers"
04-07-2020T05:57:40,AspiringNoodle,"And dropped nearly $1,000 into the safe both days as well"
04-07-2020T06:01:32,AspiringNoodle,"But that's retail 2020 in a nutshell, I guess :upside_down:"
04-07-2020T06:28:15,AspiringNoodle,"...Tencent, please pack the fug up and quarantine yourself in China... permanently..."
04-07-2020T06:28:35,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
04-07-2020T06:29:28,AspiringNoodle,They're making their own Cyberpunk game called Code: SYN
04-07-2020T06:30:04,AspiringNoodle,"Let's see: Genre that is a GIANT criticism / warning on megacorporations and their power / influence, and / or potential authoritarian government"
04-07-2020T06:30:28,AspiringNoodle,Being made by a megacorporation housed in a country with an authoritarian government...
04-07-2020T06:30:36,AspiringNoodle,Irony much?
04-07-2020T06:31:41,AspiringNoodle,"If you thought the Overwatch-clone and Battle-Royale clone phases were bad, wait for the flood of knock-off Cyberpunk games..."
04-07-2020T06:32:32,TerraTheWizard,oh right
04-07-2020T06:33:26,AspiringNoodle,"I'm honestly considering buying CP2077 on two separate game stores, lol"
04-07-2020T06:33:46,AspiringNoodle,"Once on Steam, and then again on GOG.  And even then, it'll probably be a steal for how long the game will take"
04-07-2020T06:36:26,AspiringNoodle,Anything fun happening on your end?
04-07-2020T06:37:01,TerraTheWizard,nope
04-07-2020T06:39:11,AspiringNoodle,"Maybe I should take a week off from the internet, sans-Tom"
04-07-2020T06:39:21,AspiringNoodle,Tom is best boi
04-07-2020T06:47:33,AspiringNoodle,"Sooooooo, what is it like working at ASDA?"

04-07-2020T14:40:22,NeonMitsumi,Blackjack!
04-07-2020T14:40:46,Twokinds,It's just a texture applied on a layer above
04-07-2020T14:41:51,Twokinds,Although I did some finessing to try and help intigrate it and make it look right
04-07-2020T14:42:22,NeonMitsumi,"Well, it turned out great, so gorgeous work on it!"
04-07-2020T14:42:42,Twokinds,Thanks!

04-07-2020T14:43:12,BlackjackSec99,excellent work! All that detail is just stunning.
04-07-2020T14:43:27,BlackjackSec99,Noodle.... A lot....

04-07-2020T14:52:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Would that count as a OC?
04-07-2020T14:52:38,Twokinds,"I don't know how, I'm looking at the form. They're completely different areas, pretty distinct."
04-07-2020T14:52:40,CrimsonHelsing,Some people must've tried putting their suggestions on shortly before going to sleep

04-07-2020T15:23:32,RimaDraws,i like the game but i am not liking who i have to defeat
04-07-2020T15:24:03,ProsePro7,Game was good the boss was just not the way they should have taken it too generic
04-07-2020T15:24:14,RimaDraws,also me playing games again means that i finally have my gaming pc running!

04-07-2020T15:25:28,Glassan,"The important factor is ""good enough for the games you play"""
04-07-2020T15:25:36,RimaDraws,so we figured it out thursday and it was the tower power button that was short circuited
04-07-2020T15:25:43,Glassan,Ooof
04-07-2020T15:25:45,RimaDraws,but i got it fixed and it works

04-07-2020T15:37:34,Twokinds,It's so hard to work with a malfunctioning moues
04-07-2020T15:37:43,RimaDraws,;_;
04-07-2020T15:37:46,RimaDraws,that sucks
04-07-2020T15:37:50,BadFoMo,Sorry.
04-07-2020T15:37:52,CrimsonHelsing,Here here
04-07-2020T15:37:53,BlackjackSec99,Can you use your tablet and stylus like a mouse?
04-07-2020T15:37:54,jirka,:cry:
04-07-2020T15:38:01,ProsePro7,Give it cheese
04-07-2020T15:38:14,Xexanoth,or a controller(if you have one)
04-07-2020T15:38:17,AspiringNoodle,How bad is it?
04-07-2020T15:38:22,AspiringNoodle,We talking double clicks?
04-07-2020T15:38:33,AspiringNoodle,"Or clicking when not clicking, random redirection of the cursor"
04-07-2020T15:38:36,AspiringNoodle,etc.
04-07-2020T15:38:45,BlackjackSec99,usually its the tracking that goes out...
04-07-2020T15:38:49,Glassan,"Robot: ""CLEAN THE GUNK OUT OF THE MOUSE!"" o/"
04-07-2020T15:39:11,AspiringNoodle,I replaced my last mouse because the right click was multi-clicking constantly
04-07-2020T15:39:29,CrimsonHelsing,"How long have you had this mouse, Tom? .3."
04-07-2020T15:39:29,AspiringNoodle,made it nearly impossible to work in Blender without taking all the extra time
04-07-2020T15:40:47,VinzArts,*Enters chat proceeds to make technical difficulties* :sob:
04-07-2020T15:41:06,Glassan,"Clearly it is you that is cursed, Vinz"
04-07-2020T15:41:25,Glassan,:V
04-07-2020T15:42:26,AspiringNoodle,This is definitely the worst timeline
04-07-2020T15:42:45,Twokinds,Only about a year
04-07-2020T15:43:00,Glassan,Ouch.
04-07-2020T15:43:02,CrimsonHelsing,Yikes!
04-07-2020T15:43:11,AspiringNoodle,00f
04-07-2020T15:43:13,Twokinds,"It's the switch inside. It's double clicking, releasing clicks when its not supposed to, etc"
04-07-2020T15:43:15,AspiringNoodle,Defective mouso...
04-07-2020T15:43:23,BadFoMo,"Psh, that's nothing!"
04-07-2020T15:43:26,AspiringNoodle,I know your pain :ptv-whiny:
04-07-2020T15:43:27,Glassan,Hate those defective switches.
04-07-2020T15:43:40,AspiringNoodle,"FoMo, try working in creative software with a misbehaving mouse, lol"
04-07-2020T15:43:54,Glassan,"And having personally replaced an actual switch, definitely not worth the effort."
04-07-2020T15:43:57,BadFoMo,I ment the age part.
04-07-2020T15:44:05,CrimsonHelsing,Ohhhh... son of a-
04-07-2020T15:44:17,AspiringNoodle,...how fast did you have one fail?... :ptv-uneasy:
04-07-2020T15:44:20,WINDOWS98SE,My last mouse failed the same way.
04-07-2020T15:44:54,Vexd,Lets see if I can luck out this time
04-07-2020T15:44:57,AspiringNoodle,My last mouse lasted a few years before the clicking issues started
04-07-2020T15:45:03,AspiringNoodle,Pretty sure it was from overuse at that point
04-07-2020T15:45:10,Glassan,"@WINDOWS98SE, given your name, I would expect them to fail in a number of other ways too. :V"
04-07-2020T15:46:03,WINDOWS98SE,The Windows 9X era mice seem to be a lot more reliable IMO.
04-07-2020T15:46:24,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Strim Time <3
04-07-2020T15:46:25,BadFoMo,We're off!

04-07-2020T15:46:28,Glassan,"The switches kinda were, tbh."

04-07-2020T18:29:14,falangie123,oh wow
04-07-2020T18:29:20,Glassan,"Heyo, Fluff"
04-07-2020T18:29:25,Stormagedon,That title almost sounds like the plot for Breath of the Wild
04-07-2020T18:29:31,Tharkis,similar to how Tokyo Mew Mew came out as a TV show in like 2002 i think?  but it's very much a 90s anime hehe

04-07-2020T18:40:09,Dragusthor,the last season of dragon ball was very good
04-07-2020T18:40:50,johnnytho,If the pokemon anime was like pokemon origins Id watch
04-07-2020T18:40:57,TheSexyBeast,Toei will never let DB be anything than the Goku & Vegeta show
04-07-2020T18:41:07,Dragusthor,King of the Hill I have not seen what it is about?
04-07-2020T18:41:26,ProsePro7,I would love it if they had a new Pokemon with the poke kids from the fanart
04-07-2020T18:41:27,Glassan,A man of Texas that sells propane and propane accessories.
04-07-2020T18:41:34,Dragusthor,Goku vs Vegeta epic
04-07-2020T18:41:34,KeefMcDerpface,yep.
04-07-2020T18:41:36,VinzArts,^
04-07-2020T18:41:38,Xexanoth,The FANS won't let DB be anything but the Goku and Vegeta show
04-07-2020T18:41:43,Glassan,And his family's wacky hijinks
04-07-2020T18:41:53,KeefMcDerpface,"""I sell propane and propane accessories."""
04-07-2020T18:41:56,7SAM,BNA was a good anime
04-07-2020T18:42:00,AspiringNoodle,King of the Hill is a work of art
04-07-2020T18:42:11,Xexanoth,"it's the same with Naruto, the second the authors try to switch away from the main characters everyone starts complaining until they put the focus back on em"
04-07-2020T18:42:26,ProsePro7,I hate DB Super.  Choreography is not as good and I miss Defalco's original score
04-07-2020T18:42:28,AspiringNoodle,"Nothing more than your typical family sitcom at its heart, but so well-done that you can't imagine it any other way but animated"
04-07-2020T18:42:37,TheSexyBeast,A lot of DB fans want the other fighters to have more relevance
04-07-2020T18:43:04,ProsePro7,Tein gets no love and Piccolo has been reduced to a babysitter tell Goku to shut up for a minute
04-07-2020T18:43:06,VinzArts,I could never get as interested in Naruto as DBZ- maybe an age thing I guess
04-07-2020T18:43:31,TheSexyBeast,Homer J. Goku
04-07-2020T18:43:37,FluffKevlar,i got really into naruto but stopped around ep 100 when i realized he wasnt gonna be the hokatage anytime soon
04-07-2020T18:43:51,ProsePro7,The heroic traffic cone was good at first then he turned into the chosen one.  Plague of Gripes does a good break down of why it sucks
04-07-2020T18:43:53,FluffKevlar,600eps later
04-07-2020T18:44:07,FluffKevlar,now im wondering why the hell im even watching macadamia
04-07-2020T18:44:09,Xexanoth,i got into naruto until the bigass Akizuki(or howerver the organizations named) war which just took forever
04-07-2020T18:44:19,SageSaga,you can skip a lot of Naruto - so many seasons of filler
04-07-2020T18:44:26,Tharkis,SSSSOOOO much filler
04-07-2020T18:44:31,ProsePro7,Same for One Piece
04-07-2020T18:44:43,Glassan,"@FluffKevlar, Longing for a series of stronger character arcs, knowing they won't ever come?"
04-07-2020T18:44:46,AspiringNoodle,But I live for the One Piece fights
04-07-2020T18:44:48,ProsePro7,Hard to get to episode 999
04-07-2020T18:44:54,FluffKevlar,yeah
04-07-2020T18:44:58,FluffKevlar,where's my next Avatar
04-07-2020T18:44:59,Glassan,I know that's why I struggled through some of them.
04-07-2020T18:45:01,Xexanoth,that's why you read the manga
04-07-2020T18:45:04,Tharkis,"fairy tail is done now, and a good watch but likewise, so much 'filler' where nothing really happens"
04-07-2020T18:45:07,ProsePro7,Trying to
04-07-2020T18:45:26,Xexanoth,Anyone watching Dragon prince? it's made by the avatar guys and supposedly pretty good
04-07-2020T18:45:30,TheSexyBeast,1P manga >>> anime
04-07-2020T18:45:57,FluffKevlar,"Avatar had a definitive end, not full of huge useless arcs, and didnt drag on"
04-07-2020T18:46:02,Melnekir,what has been draw previously? :O
04-07-2020T18:46:02,VinzArts,I mean some of those fight scenes in Naruto were beautiful but I got lost in the filler
04-07-2020T18:46:04,FluffKevlar,probably one of my favourite anime
04-07-2020T18:46:06,Twokinds,Done
04-07-2020T18:46:07,Sammit,Very nice
04-07-2020T18:46:07,Werewing,"I like Dragon Prince. Some of the animation is a bit weak, though."

04-07-2020T20:59:18,TraceLegacyXI,Maybe?
04-07-2020T20:59:26,Ordithus,"not technically, since Eric and Saria don't own either (anymore at least)"

04-07-2020T21:04:33,AspiringNoodle,His work too spicy
04-07-2020T21:04:36,KeefMcDerpface,Wonder what the conversation will be between these two.
04-07-2020T21:04:51,hyneria,"There is something I wonder about the TK world tho. I'm assuming Eric's paintings are popular, more so given what was Kat's purpose in life. So that mean human guys often take female keidran as, mmm.... ""companionship""?"
04-07-2020T21:04:54,Stormagedon,I made it up the mountain!
04-07-2020T21:05:03,TraceLegacyXI,Has anyone else here wondered what it’d be like to have a tail for just one day?
04-07-2020T21:05:08,TraceLegacyXI,Or is that just me?

04-07-2020T21:05:35,AspiringNoodle,Give me the full package for a year

04-07-2020T21:05:36,Werewing,I imagine it is mostly screaming OW! I got my tail stuck in the door again.
04-07-2020T21:05:37,TraceLegacyXI,That is fair
04-07-2020T21:05:48,Katfeathers,Phantom limb wings here
04-07-2020T21:05:48,TraceLegacyXI,Hmmm
04-07-2020T21:06:20,Stormagedon,"Noodle, can I also sign up?"
04-07-2020T21:06:22,CrRAR,you feel like you have flappy wings?
04-07-2020T21:06:29,CrRAR,but don't
04-07-2020T21:06:30,TraceLegacyXI,Nah
04-07-2020T21:06:37,TraceLegacyXI,Wings are overrated
04-07-2020T21:06:51,KeefMcDerpface,But you can fly over traffic.
04-07-2020T21:06:57,Katfeathers,Also if ya grow up with one ya tend not to get it stuck in stuff
04-07-2020T21:07:02,TraceLegacyXI,I’m afraid of heights
04-07-2020T21:07:09,hyneria,"TraceLegacyXI, if you had a tail it would have to be a monkey one, given we are primates :P"
04-07-2020T21:07:21,TraceLegacyXI,Nahhh
04-07-2020T21:07:37,Werewing,"Oh, so you want to be a Nekomata?"
04-07-2020T21:07:40,Stormagedon,the full package though. We would have to learn to walk again
04-07-2020T21:07:44,TraceLegacyXI,I was thinking more of like Kat’s tail... or Sythe’s tail
04-07-2020T21:07:53,KeefMcDerpface,Storm is right about that...
04-07-2020T21:07:54,hyneria,canine tail?
04-07-2020T21:07:58,TraceLegacyXI,Ye
04-07-2020T21:08:23,TraceLegacyXI,Fluffy
04-07-2020T21:08:29,Stormagedon,walking Digi would be hard. different bone structure
04-07-2020T21:08:34,hyneria,"I guess it wouldn't be that annoying. Without the fur, canine tails are pretty short and unimpressive"
04-07-2020T21:08:37,BadFoMo,Back. What's this about tails?
04-07-2020T21:08:46,KeefMcDerpface,wb
04-07-2020T21:08:48,TraceLegacyXI,Nothing...
04-07-2020T21:08:50,Werewing,Trace wants a Kat Tail.
04-07-2020T21:08:53,KeefMcDerpface,^
04-07-2020T21:08:54,Katfeathers,"That'd still be the *poof* now ya have one deal, not the grew up with it deal"
04-07-2020T21:09:00,TraceLegacyXI,Maybe a bit yes
04-07-2020T21:09:20,AspiringNoodle,I only have one question about the Rose painting
04-07-2020T21:09:27,Stormagedon,I want the full deal FoMo
04-07-2020T21:09:28,KeefMcDerpface,Yes?
04-07-2020T21:09:29,hyneria,having a tail would be possible. I mean we do have a remnant of a tail in the pelvic bones.
04-07-2020T21:09:37,AspiringNoodle,"Did Rose sign up for the pose enthusiastically, or does Eric have a *very* active imagination?"
04-07-2020T21:09:41,TraceLegacyXI,Ya don’t say?
04-07-2020T21:09:42,hyneria,Wings would be absolutely impossible with a human like body
04-07-2020T21:09:52,TraceLegacyXI,Just ask Nora
