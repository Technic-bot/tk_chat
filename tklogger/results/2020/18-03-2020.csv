18-03-2020T17:18:22,TerraTheWizard,we just got the cover for chapter 21
18-03-2020T17:19:20,TerraTheWizard,you can look at the archive tab on the site to see how many pages are in each chapter
18-03-2020T17:21:22,DZAladan,"If I remember correctly, the comic is around 1500 pages, so... an average of 71 pages per chapter."
18-03-2020T17:21:25,DZAladan,Hrrrmh... ~1500 pages is honestly pretty daunting to catch up to. lol
18-03-2020T17:24:41,TerraTheWizard,1099
18-03-2020T17:24:56,TerraTheWizard,though that count includes fillers
18-03-2020T17:25:09,DZAladan,"Oh, my bad. I must have confused with something else. Sorry."
18-03-2020T17:26:14,DZAladan,Still... it's a lot of stuff. lol
18-03-2020T17:26:27,DZAladan,"Hopefully I can use chapters as ""checkpoints""."
18-03-2020T17:26:29,TerraTheWizard,i think the recent chapters have been averaging around 85 pages

18-03-2020T19:49:22,CrRAR,Yeah my brother's office is like that
18-03-2020T19:49:32,DZAladan,"And you all still outside, because work or anything else, please, for goodness sake, take care and be careful."
18-03-2020T19:49:55,CrRAR,They're having the concerned employees organize cleaning squads themselves
18-03-2020T19:50:07,CrRAR,Don't think that'll last long

18-03-2020T19:51:13,CrRAR,The order for us to WFH was Monday except for extreme circumstances.
18-03-2020T19:51:36,CrRAR,I had to go in to wrap some stuff up in person Tues/Wed though
18-03-2020T19:51:55,Ordithus,"about half the office is already working from home, rumors are that it will be extended monday"
18-03-2020T19:52:06,CrRAR,yeah
18-03-2020T19:53:07,Ordithus,I'm more concerned for the folks on the floor.  They can't work from home
18-03-2020T19:53:44,CrRAR,"yeah, if they start getting sick it'll be bad."
18-03-2020T20:00:18,Ordithus,"good to be in one of the more remote cities!  It's cold here, no one wants to come"

18-03-2020T20:22:20,SpazztasticKiwi,so a friend of mine had a minor heart attack being sick
18-03-2020T20:22:25,SpazztasticKiwi,it was the flu
18-03-2020T20:22:34,SpazztasticKiwi,+ strep throat
18-03-2020T20:22:36,Ordithus,"yikes, they ok?"

18-03-2020T20:25:30,CrRAR,"Yes, hope they're doing okay"
18-03-2020T20:25:39,CrRAR,"eugh, that's a rough combination"
18-03-2020T20:26:21,CrRAR,2020 is very mean year

18-03-2020T20:29:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean he says he’s alive
18-03-2020T20:29:33,Ordithus,that's good.  could be zombie tho
18-03-2020T20:29:42,DZAladan,Well... I mean... if HE says so...
18-03-2020T20:31:14,SpazztasticKiwi,people asking him on his post “where are you”
18-03-2020T20:31:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"dude, he’s got the flu and strep - he’s at home"
18-03-2020T20:32:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"it’s not shown up in this county yet, but we have 68 cases as of this morning"
18-03-2020T20:32:18,SpazztasticKiwi,mostly in Tuscaloosa
18-03-2020T20:33:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I did hear a guy the other day talking to mcdonalds workers that his dad was showing signs & they were putting him in the hospital or at least getting him tested
18-03-2020T20:34:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"but since I wasn’t in the conversation, they may have been talking about the flu since it’s shown up in a wave across the board with so many people going to get tested when that’s what they have instead"
18-03-2020T20:40:52,SpazztasticKiwi,good part about it is said friend isn’t even 30 yet so he’s good
18-03-2020T20:41:28,DZAladan,"Hopefully he gets well soon. Send him wishes from me, even if we don't know each other."

18-03-2020T21:42:10,BlackjacksSec99,fun stuffs
18-03-2020T21:42:34,BlackjacksSec99,im trying to figure out what my Gov meant by issuing a stay at home order
18-03-2020T21:43:58,CrRAR,>be home
18-03-2020T21:44:05,CrRAR,>don't be not home
18-03-2020T21:44:34,BlackjacksSec99,"but i work in a hardware store, which apparently, is essential"
18-03-2020T21:45:11,CrRAR,really?
18-03-2020T21:45:16,BlackjacksSec99,"also, small family owned hardware store, lack of customers is hurting. badly..."
18-03-2020T21:45:17,BlackjacksSec99,yeah
18-03-2020T21:45:32,CrRAR,Well I would listen to the manager there.
18-03-2020T21:45:48,BlackjacksSec99,"what happens if you have a pipe break? or electrical issue, or need to fix your roof or the like?"
18-03-2020T21:46:24,BlackjacksSec99,"thing is the family that owns it is my family.  so, kinda scary times."
18-03-2020T21:46:30,CrRAR,ohhh
18-03-2020T21:46:36,CrRAR,ok
18-03-2020T21:46:57,CrRAR,"Yeah I was going to say, probably will let what staff know who's working when"
18-03-2020T21:47:20,CrRAR,I'd imagine there'll will be extra logging of who works when/where
18-03-2020T21:48:02,CrRAR,Elon wanted to try to keep the Tesla factory open.
18-03-2020T21:48:04,CrRAR,"Sheriff: ""no"""
18-03-2020T21:48:18,CrRAR,...but yeah essential supplies are more important
18-03-2020T21:48:18,BlackjacksSec99,"yeah, weve had to cut hours by over 70% so far and cut 2 hours off our open time, before all this stay at home stuff because of a lack of customers"
18-03-2020T21:48:52,CrRAR,"yeah I was gonna say, if people can't leave their homes there's not going to be many"
18-03-2020T21:49:06,CrRAR,cept like you said for emergencies
18-03-2020T21:49:20,Sclimshady,Its mainly open to support contractors and others
18-03-2020T21:49:27,CrRAR,yeah
18-03-2020T21:49:47,Sclimshady,We get stuff from hardware stores all the time
18-03-2020T21:49:53,BlackjacksSec99,"theres some, but mostly they are the ""its a hoax"" type and dont believe theres an issue"
18-03-2020T21:50:05,CrRAR,wow
18-03-2020T21:50:07,CrRAR,haha
18-03-2020T21:50:22,BlackjacksSec99,*sigh* yeah....
18-03-2020T21:50:27,CrRAR,How do we only wish it was fake news xD
18-03-2020T21:50:49,CrRAR,I do think the panic is out of control though personally
18-03-2020T21:50:52,BlackjacksSec99,Actually had to show one guy my friend's facebook posts where she is in the hospital because of it.
18-03-2020T21:51:02,CrRAR,oh wow
18-03-2020T21:51:07,BlackjacksSec99,just to get him to shut up about it being a hoax
18-03-2020T21:51:51,CrRAR,"yeah, it does attack the lungs so, different folks are much more vulnerable."
18-03-2020T21:51:52,BlackjacksSec99,"thankfully, my friend is recovering, but yeah, hospitalised from it, no prior conditions, 28 years old"
18-03-2020T21:52:11,CrRAR,dang
18-03-2020T21:52:31,CrRAR,steady recovery so far?
18-03-2020T21:52:51,BlackjacksSec99,"yeah, shes doing good, releasing her tomorrow."

18-03-2020T21:53:33,BlackjacksSec99,"still on meds, but stable and able to be sent home to fully recover."

18-03-2020T22:06:17,CrRAR,"Such isolated places have the virus now, even inland African and random Caribbean islands. How is it so stupid prolific?"
18-03-2020T22:06:36,BlackjacksSec99,because stupid long incubation
18-03-2020T22:06:50,BlackjacksSec99,"2-14 days, sometimes up to 4 weeks"
18-03-2020T22:07:09,BlackjacksSec99,"contaigous for most of that time, before you get symptoms"
18-03-2020T22:07:19,BlackjacksSec99,thats what makes it SO dangerous
18-03-2020T22:07:58,BlackjacksSec99,you could infect 50 people before you knew you were even sick.
18-03-2020T22:08:37,BlackjacksSec99,remember SARS? (related to covid-19 btw)
18-03-2020T22:08:48,CrRAR,yup!
18-03-2020T22:08:59,BlackjacksSec99,they say more than half the cases traced back to ONE doctor who infected 6 people
18-03-2020T22:09:22,BlackjacksSec99,just 6. and it EXPLODED from there.
18-03-2020T22:09:34,CrRAR,"That's what I've been gauging this by, internally I've been like ""We got through SARS!"""
18-03-2020T22:09:51,BlackjacksSec99,and the spread rate of sars was nothing like covid-19
18-03-2020T22:09:55,CrRAR,SARS got news-worthy scary but it never got to this level
18-03-2020T22:10:04,CrRAR,yeah not so virulent

18-03-2020T22:47:01,Ordithus,she's more southern
18-03-2020T22:47:35,Ordithus,"can have a more ""proper"" accent when she wants but slips into country gal :ctwokinds-rose:"

18-03-2020T22:53:55,CrRAR,though some things are really specific I guess
18-03-2020T22:54:36,BlackjacksSec99,"weve thought of that, but making it work with our current tech isint really easy"
18-03-2020T22:54:55,CrRAR,yeah I could see that really being a pain.

18-03-2020T23:13:23,AspiringNoodle,I'm quitting wow now :P
18-03-2020T23:13:53,AspiringNoodle,"I think I'm just done until shadowlands, and unless reviews are glowing, I'll be done with WoW for good.  Or if I do play WoW in the future, it'll be in a very limited capacity"
18-03-2020T23:14:18,AspiringNoodle,WoW has burned me too many times in the past few years
18-03-2020T23:15:10,AspiringNoodle,"Suffice to say, even the Culpera couldn't keep me around for long"
18-03-2020T23:15:14,AspiringNoodle,Vulpera*
18-03-2020T23:15:15,BlackjacksSec99,"ive never really been THAT deep into it, really... always played solo, usually just getting up to level 30 or so then trying something else"
18-03-2020T23:15:56,JojoF2415,I sometimes play video games but i mostly draw
18-03-2020T23:16:27,JojoF2415,Its close to be a year since i got into antro art
18-03-2020T23:18:11,BlackjacksSec99,"awesome! ive been a fan for a few years, but im only just now wanting to TRY to start drawing..."

18-03-2020T23:19:49,BlackjacksSec99,"ok, yeah, theres a lot of THAT art out there, but the fandom as a whole is a LOT more than porn"
18-03-2020T23:20:12,AspiringNoodle,I like pointing to Viktria
18-03-2020T23:20:17,JojoF2415,I know right
18-03-2020T23:20:20,AspiringNoodle,She does both.  Her porn is so wholesome xD
18-03-2020T23:20:36,JojoF2415,Whats wrong about being a furry
18-03-2020T23:20:44,AspiringNoodle,"Like, the only thing lewd about her comics are the literal acts, but the story telling itself is on another level"
18-03-2020T23:21:13,AspiringNoodle,I'm also a huge fan of her New Dawn comic c:
18-03-2020T23:21:38,BlackjacksSec99,"thats what I look for, great story telling (hence why im here lol)"
18-03-2020T23:21:41,JojoF2415,I used to be a weeaboo but i lost interest in anime
18-03-2020T23:22:07,JojoF2415,I got into anthro art which is something i don't regret
18-03-2020T23:23:17,BlackjacksSec99,"im mostly a fanfiction guy. anywhere there are great stories written, im interested."
18-03-2020T23:24:41,BlackjacksSec99,"kind of got into anthro art in a roundabout way through fiction, really.... werewolf/creature transformation stories lead to fan art, which lead to google searches and yeah...."
18-03-2020T23:25:14,JojoF2415,I read a story called jazmyn's world. I still need 5 more chapters
18-03-2020T23:26:48,JojoF2415,I was shocked reading some parts of the story
18-03-2020T23:27:03,BlackjacksSec99,where is this story at?
18-03-2020T23:27:42,JojoF2415,I read it on wattpad but i want to finish it on the hard copy
18-03-2020T23:29:05,BlackjacksSec99,"Ill have to look into it, thanks :)"
18-03-2020T23:33:26,JojoF2415,i just realized it my first time drawing trunks
