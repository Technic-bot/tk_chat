06-03-2020T01:16:12,Nekonny,ok... nOW I'm going to bed

06-03-2020T01:16:50,Kagiyama89,good night again ron~
06-03-2020T01:17:51,JeremySenpai,GN Neko
06-03-2020T01:19:00,Werewing,"I don't know how to say that there appear to be cases in Austrailia, according to the infection map I googled. Not many, but still. And didn't it hit pandemic status yesterday? And should I drop this topic for being morbid?"
06-03-2020T01:20:31,JeremySenpai,I only point it out because it seems silly to me. because of other people being idiots i need to change my shopping habbits and buy when i see an item available rather than when i actually need it
06-03-2020T01:21:16,SageSaga,it hit pandemic a long time ago because pandemic only means it's found in multiple countries
06-03-2020T01:21:37,Werewing,"That is extremely annoying. Oh, I might be getting epidemic and pandemic confused."
06-03-2020T01:22:11,SageSaga,no Epidemic just means an outbreak in a single country
06-03-2020T01:23:01,JeremySenpai,I think I am right in saying the dagerous part of CV-19 is the fever and stuff in lungs
06-03-2020T01:23:19,SageSaga,so it was an epidemic and became a pandemic- though i suppose some health organization might have a stricter reason to call something a pandemic- like uncontrolled in multiple regions
06-03-2020T01:23:35,JeremySenpai,keep fever down and lungs clear and all will be Daijobu
06-03-2020T01:23:50,Werewing,"I think I recall the lethal part being liver failure, but that might just be in people with compromised immune systems."
06-03-2020T01:24:02,LyricZ,Awh i missed the stream
06-03-2020T01:24:28,SageSaga,the danger of it comes from it's ability to spread quickly to many people with minimal exposure due to its long incubation time
06-03-2020T01:24:34,Ordithus,But there are 2 streams right now
06-03-2020T01:24:54,KeefMcDerpface,^
06-03-2020T01:25:04,Werewing,"Yeah, Jeremy and Sage."
06-03-2020T01:25:09,LyricZ,Ye
06-03-2020T01:25:19,KeefMcDerpface,"Well, I'm going to bed. Night all."

06-03-2020T01:25:58,JeremySenpai,Thanks for watching
06-03-2020T01:26:37,KeefMcDerpface,Let me guess.
06-03-2020T01:26:42,KeefMcDerpface,*Please like and subscribe.*
06-03-2020T01:26:48,SageSaga,if it's really a 2-3% mortality rate with a high chance of infection then losing 2-3% of the world population is extremely serious- thats why people are over reacting and going out of their way to avoid it
06-03-2020T01:26:54,FoxxTrotter,"I'm off to bed as well. G'night, everyone. :0)"
06-03-2020T01:27:04,Ordithus,night Foxx

06-03-2020T01:42:34,Werewing,He was hungry. And sad about potato pics for some reason.
06-03-2020T01:42:44,Mihari,The better question is why don't all canvases have them?
06-03-2020T01:42:49,CaveGrue,lol

06-03-2020T03:12:44,TheWildDash,"Eh, I appreciate the (usually smaller) streamers who actually put the effort into making their streams enjoyable on twitch. All of the bigger, more inconsistent streamers just get stale and uninteresting"

06-03-2020T03:21:10,SageSaga,their purpose is to show that the stream is active even when we are looking over the image looking for things to fix and not moving it or drawing/coloring
06-03-2020T03:21:22,TheWildDash,It’s probs just my tired brain pulling a solid 3-second attention span

06-03-2020T03:34:07,TheWildDash,For any of you who are wondering it’s called the Seaboard Block from a group called Roli

06-03-2020T15:50:00,kittyelfie,hello
06-03-2020T15:50:10,FoxxTrotter,"I have to head out. Later, everyone. :0)"

06-03-2020T15:50:18,Ordithus,bye Foxx
06-03-2020T15:50:20,FoxxTrotter,"Bye, Mihari. ;0P"
06-03-2020T15:50:25,Mihari,"Hi, and bye!"
06-03-2020T15:50:29,SageSaga,"bye Foxx, howdy hun"
06-03-2020T15:52:37,Mihari,"I hate that last panel, when there is a lot of overhead space like that, it means lots of text! T_T"
06-03-2020T15:53:47,SageSaga,XD you already know the text!
06-03-2020T15:54:06,Mihari,"I assume nothing, stuff can change before final!"
06-03-2020T15:54:54,SageSaga,true but for once i think im gonna stick 99% with this one
06-03-2020T15:56:47,Mihari,Scroll down to the bottom panel a sec?
06-03-2020T16:04:56,DNMZ,Good day all
06-03-2020T16:05:03,SageSaga,yo
06-03-2020T16:08:16,DNMZ,I see this is one of the more sexy fanservicey pages
06-03-2020T16:09:19,DNMZ,With some sweetness thrown in
06-03-2020T16:09:34,SageSaga,She s;leeps naked and shes getting ready for bed-
06-03-2020T16:10:47,SageSaga,also - might have sex first so :csagesaga-philhuh:
06-03-2020T16:12:01,DNMZ,Don't mind that at all lol
06-03-2020T16:12:10,SageSaga,but after this we skip to morning in traditional RPG fashion
06-03-2020T16:14:36,DNMZ,"So just gonna fade to black here, no shadowy sillouettes or implied stuff in the next page? Awww, hehe."
06-03-2020T16:15:02,BadFoMo,They wake up and find that they both have the 'Well Rested' perk?
06-03-2020T16:16:16,SageSaga,Lovers Comfort Perk
06-03-2020T16:16:54,DNMZ,That sounds so cute
06-03-2020T16:17:14,SageSaga,that was the perk you got from sleeping with your wife/husband in Skyrim
06-03-2020T16:18:32,DNMZ,Talk about rewarding sex
06-03-2020T16:18:39,DNMZ,Literally
06-03-2020T16:35:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I jumped in at the wrong time
06-03-2020T16:35:43,SageSaga,did ya?
06-03-2020T16:36:42,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-reniderp: kiwi!
06-03-2020T16:37:50,BadFoMo,Yo.
06-03-2020T16:40:21,DNMZ,"Hey random question. Do Kaylin, Nyna and any of the characters have ref sheets?"
06-03-2020T16:40:48,SageSaga,not really- i dont generally make ref sheets
06-03-2020T16:41:54,SpazztasticKiwi,ooooooorrrrrdddddddddddddx
06-03-2020T16:41:55,SageSaga,i know all their traits and for keeping colors consistent i just use previous pictures in similar lighting
06-03-2020T16:42:53,DNMZ,"Ah ok, was just wondering about stuff like their height, weight, measurements and so on"
06-03-2020T16:43:57,SageSaga,"Nyna is 5 Feet tall, Kaylin is 5'8"" - this is subject to slight change though"
06-03-2020T16:44:37,SageSaga,"for instance i cant remember if Kaylin is 5'8"" or 5'6"""
06-03-2020T16:45:00,SageSaga,usually doesnt matter though- so long as shes shorter than some people and taller than others
06-03-2020T16:45:49,BadFoMo,Inb4 someone plays with a shrinkray near Nyna and Kaylin?
06-03-2020T16:45:56,Mihari,"5'8"" seems more on point given earlier points in the comic."
06-03-2020T16:46:03,SageSaga,yeah
06-03-2020T16:46:14,DNMZ,Oh I always assume Kaylin was closer to 6 feet for some reasons. Like 5'10 or more. You know she a bit of a amazonian beauty
06-03-2020T16:46:24,SageSaga,Nyna can also get some height on her toes more than most due to anthro feet
06-03-2020T16:47:27,SageSaga,the thing is sometime i draw her like shes taller just to show her as being powerful compared to others
06-03-2020T16:47:54,SageSaga,one of the reasons i dont usually focus too much on their height- it can be used abstractly sometimes
06-03-2020T16:48:14,DNMZ,Mmmm
06-03-2020T16:48:25,SageSaga,"but yeah- day to day i go with about 5'*"""
06-03-2020T16:48:32,SageSaga,"5'8""*"
06-03-2020T16:49:40,DNMZ,"5'8, muscular and busty"
06-03-2020T16:50:28,SageSaga,yeah- Dark elves and moon elves are usually on the shorter side while high elves are usually a bit taller
06-03-2020T16:51:15,Ordithus,But they all have long ears
06-03-2020T16:51:57,SageSaga,". . . yes, because they are all elves"
06-03-2020T16:53:09,Ordithus,Kaylin seems particularly muscular for an elf
06-03-2020T16:53:47,DNMZ,Hey Sage do you ever draw your characters cosplaying or as characters from movies or TV shows?
06-03-2020T16:54:15,SageSaga,she's an adventurer elf with a lot of athletic abilities
06-03-2020T16:54:26,SageSaga,yeah sorta DNMZ
06-03-2020T16:54:58,Ordithus,and a certain slider *just* shy of max :csagesaga-kaylinheart:
06-03-2020T16:55:44,SageSaga,max is also different based on race- high elves and humans both have a higher cap
06-03-2020T16:55:57,DNMZ,"Mmm, personally like the idea of Kaylin as the Winter Soldier. Metal arm, mask and her just being a badass hehe"
06-03-2020T16:56:39,SageSaga,next chapter- characters get to show off how cool they are
06-03-2020T16:58:22,Ordithus,Look forward to it!  The blood claw fight was cool but Kaylin and Nyna did walk all over them
06-03-2020T16:59:06,SageSaga,yeah the purpose to that was to show what the average to slightly above average humans were like
06-03-2020T16:59:23,SageSaga,and also to show they could use magic items
06-03-2020T17:00:49,SageSaga,"Realm's Brother, the guard Captain, is slightly higher ""level"" than that gangs boss- but would stand no chance against him with the gauntlet- but now he's probably the strongest in the city thanks to the gauntlet"
06-03-2020T17:01:31,Ordithus,Limitless power! :ctwokinds-power:
06-03-2020T17:01:43,DNMZ,The fights in this comic have always been good
06-03-2020T17:01:49,Ordithus,Magic weapons make a lot of difference
06-03-2020T17:02:53,SageSaga,Kaylin has some amazing gear- but i havent been able to show off her skills yet really- she hasnt used like any special abilities so far
06-03-2020T17:03:29,SageSaga,in the intro she showed one of her racial spells- but thats about it
06-03-2020T17:03:40,DNMZ,Interested in seeing them
06-03-2020T17:04:34,Ordithus,"my dnd cleric got a +con item, now she can survive being hit!"
06-03-2020T17:05:15,SageSaga,"did i tell ya about my halfling ""cleric"" (warlock actually) that got gauntlets of Ogre power?"
06-03-2020T17:05:47,Ordithus,mine has those!
06-03-2020T17:05:56,Ordithus,"When she hits, she hits HARD"
06-03-2020T17:06:11,CrRAR,:ptv-ohmy:
06-03-2020T17:06:13,CrRAR,such a seductive Nyna
06-03-2020T17:06:30,Ordithus,hi CrRAR :ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:

06-03-2020T17:07:05,Ordithus,wb
06-03-2020T17:07:29,SageSaga,"my group found these gauntlets of Ogre power and almost everyone was like ""I cant use them- my str is already 19"" or ""I only use dex-"" so i was like ""Well i could use them since i only have an 8 str"""
06-03-2020T17:07:29,aeoronwah,h e w w o
06-03-2020T17:07:37,SageSaga,yo Aeoronwah!
06-03-2020T17:07:40,SageSaga,been a while!
06-03-2020T17:07:48,DNMZ,Talking about a cleric who hits hard makes me think of Jester from Critical Role
06-03-2020T17:07:51,Ordithus,8 str oh dear
06-03-2020T17:08:04,aeoronwah,"yeah, sorry life's been a bit hectic"
06-03-2020T17:08:26,BadFoMo,"Is it just me, or is the way this show is framed make in look like Kaylin just grew a tail like Nyna's?"
06-03-2020T17:08:28,SageSaga,no problem
06-03-2020T17:08:42,SageSaga,ha XD
06-03-2020T17:08:42,Ordithus,just you
06-03-2020T17:08:56,Ordithus,looks closer to Kaylin needing to sneeze after a tail tease
06-03-2020T17:09:54,SageSaga,"so anywho! my halfling with the gauntlets got attacked from behind by a cultist- and the DM was like ""Ok its your turn- what do you do?"" and i said ""IM GONNA WRESTLE HIM TO THE GROUND!"""
06-03-2020T17:10:40,SageSaga,"and i rolled decent and with my new str score i just physically dominated him and he yelled ""AH! His tiny hands are so strong!"""
06-03-2020T17:10:46,Ordithus,lol
06-03-2020T17:10:52,DNMZ,Nice
06-03-2020T17:11:52,aeoronwah,lol
06-03-2020T17:11:52,SageSaga,"everytime someone was like ""Can i get some help lifting something?"" i was always the first to jump at the chance because- it was a new experience for him XD"
06-03-2020T17:13:30,Ordithus,my cleric has actually always been the strongest in the party.  Our fighter is dex based so the cleric is the muscle
06-03-2020T17:13:43,SageSaga,"""The two of you try and try to lift the gate but it's just too heavy for you"" ""Hey- i know you said only 2 people can get to it but- im small- 2 feet 10 inches tall and only 34lbs- can i get in and help?"" *Throws Gate open*"
06-03-2020T17:14:36,BadFoMo,Haha!
06-03-2020T17:14:53,SageSaga,oh XD in my current D&D game on thursdays im the strongest person in the party- im a wizard
06-03-2020T17:15:02,Ordithus,this is concerning
06-03-2020T17:15:25,SageSaga,we have a bunch of dex people and healing/spell casting clerics
06-03-2020T17:15:31,Ordithus,"but anytime we have a stealth check, I inevitbaly roll a 1"
06-03-2020T17:15:49,SageSaga,so the joke is im doing pushups while studying my spell book every day
06-03-2020T17:15:56,Ordithus,"now if we have to be sneaky, I get polymorphed into a mouse and stuck in a pocket"
06-03-2020T17:16:35,Ordithus,lifting those heavy tomes~
06-03-2020T17:17:05,BadFoMo,"A little late, but; NPC1: How did they punch a hole through a 10' thick stone wall?! NPC2: A Wizard did it!"
06-03-2020T17:17:31,DNMZ,"Ok time for bed. Bye all, take care. And the page is looking real good Sage"
06-03-2020T17:17:38,Ordithus,night dnmz

06-03-2020T17:38:08,SageSaga,ty
06-03-2020T17:38:22,BadFoMo,What about the armbands in panels 2 and 6?
06-03-2020T17:38:25,SageSaga,also thank you all for hanging out- glad it finally worked
06-03-2020T17:38:37,Ordithus,thanks for the stream!
06-03-2020T17:38:45,SageSaga,the arm bands light up like that when shes putting stuff away or taking them out
06-03-2020T17:38:51,SageSaga,she just put her shirt away
06-03-2020T17:38:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Thanks for the streamy Sage
06-03-2020T17:39:06,BadFoMo,"Ah, thanks."

06-03-2020T17:39:37,BadFoMo,"Also, here's hoping Picarto stays good this time."
06-03-2020T17:39:44,SageSaga,they can also be stealthed to not sparkle like that but shes not trying to sneakily put her shirt away XD
06-03-2020T17:40:50,SageSaga,take care folks! thanks again!
06-03-2020T17:40:54,Ordithus,see ya
06-03-2020T17:40:59,kittyelfie,Thank you for letting me watch

06-03-2020T17:43:02,BadFoMo,...Are there any restricions as to what she can store and how she can store in? I'm seeing someone with armbands like that stealing someone's clothes right off of them while they are wearing then.
