09-07-2020T08:36:34,AspiringNoodle,I can take a joke
09-07-2020T08:37:09,AspiringNoodle,"It's that literally we kept getting wiped because one of their players had a taste for flanking, and his character choice could more or less instantly kill someone"
09-07-2020T08:38:11,AspiringNoodle,"Also, that was a joke in and of itself xD"
09-07-2020T08:39:00,AspiringNoodle,"bleh, brain, y u no let me sleep -_-"
09-07-2020T08:41:15,AspiringNoodle,"So Xexa, what kind of games do you play?"
09-07-2020T09:02:46,Xexanoth,Neverwinter Nights atm
09-07-2020T09:03:10,Xexanoth,finally caught up with my gaming backlog to a game that came out 18 years ago
09-07-2020T09:03:29,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-laugh:
09-07-2020T09:03:38,AspiringNoodle,My backlog just keeps growing because of all these free games
09-07-2020T09:04:06,Xexanoth,and all the new games that keep coming out
09-07-2020T09:04:11,AspiringNoodle,"EGS is offering up Killing Floor 2, Lifeless Planet, and The Escapists 2 right now"
09-07-2020T09:04:52,Xexanoth,"funilly enough, the only game that i played this year that actually was relased this year is a remaster of a 90s game."
09-07-2020T09:05:12,AspiringNoodle,"I'm slowly working through my backlog, though I've deviated a smidge"
09-07-2020T09:05:23,AspiringNoodle,I'm almost done getting through my wii games
09-07-2020T09:09:16,Xexanoth,in only have the Neverweinter Nights games(plus dlc) and the Mteroid Prime series left....and a lot of games that came out in the last 3 years
09-07-2020T09:09:45,Xexanoth,cause i pretty much went: i'm not gonna play new games until i went through the bvacklog....and that took a while XD
09-07-2020T09:12:21,AspiringNoodle,I really want for Nintendo to remaster some WiiU games for the switch :(
09-07-2020T09:12:35,AspiringNoodle,They even admitted the console was a flop
09-07-2020T09:13:17,Xexanoth,which is probably the reason why they'll not remaster the games
09-07-2020T09:14:24,AspiringNoodle,"Well, there's one title in particular I want redone..."
09-07-2020T09:14:29,AspiringNoodle,Star Fox Zero
09-07-2020T09:14:56,AspiringNoodle,It is itself a remaster of Star Fox 64 which had a release on the 3DS with a kind of remaster
09-07-2020T09:15:16,AspiringNoodle,And mixed in some elements from the unreleased Star Fox 2 for the SNES
09-07-2020T09:15:38,Xexanoth,Yo dog i heard you like remasters so i remastered your remaster :ptv-laugh:
09-07-2020T09:15:58,AspiringNoodle,"It's the last ""new"" entry we've had in a long time, and it didn't do too hot on the WiiU because they made some aspects of the game *require* the tablet's screen"
09-07-2020T09:16:08,AspiringNoodle,But those sections were clunky af and made the game harder than it was meant to be
09-07-2020T09:16:43,AspiringNoodle,"If they could update the graphics for the Switch's power and remove that god awful aspect of the game, it might actually be viewed positively"
09-07-2020T09:16:56,AspiringNoodle,"I want my rail shooters, dangit D:<"
09-07-2020T09:20:01,Xexanoth,Just build a gun that shoots rails :ptv-SteelwormHades:
09-07-2020T09:28:20,AspiringNoodle,"It's sad to say, but the last progression the series saw was with Star Fox Assault"
09-07-2020T09:28:36,AspiringNoodle,And that's from flippin' 2005!
09-07-2020T09:29:21,AspiringNoodle,"You could count Star Fox: Command from 2006, but that's a DS game and it has multiple endings"
09-07-2020T09:31:18,AspiringNoodle,But they've never really acknowledged that game as canon to the story
09-07-2020T09:31:33,AspiringNoodle,"And not a lot of good endings in that one, lol"
09-07-2020T09:48:22,AspiringNoodle,"Huh, my body might finally be ready for me to sleep, let's find out"

09-07-2020T17:36:21,AspiringNoodle,hard drives are *great* for long-term storage
09-07-2020T17:38:56,AspiringNoodle,Some scientists a few years ago attempted to extract data from 30 year old hard drives and they had 0 data corruption
09-07-2020T17:39:23,AspiringNoodle,"Sadly, apparently HDD's still haven't gotten a good boost to durability :("
09-07-2020T17:39:41,AspiringNoodle,"While an SSD can last 10 years (give or take a few), the average HDD is expected to last 3 - 5"
09-07-2020T17:41:34,Xexanoth,what the hell are people doing with their HDD that they only last 3-5 years?
09-07-2020T17:44:01,AspiringNoodle,Using it?
09-07-2020T17:44:36,pretorian,"My HDD has 5 years waranty, I expect it to last longer. Then again I don't buy cheapest junk that market has to offer."
09-07-2020T17:45:15,AspiringNoodle,That is part of it
09-07-2020T17:45:26,AspiringNoodle,"Failure rates can vary wildly among manufacturers, and even model / capacity"
09-07-2020T17:46:06,pretorian,"For the record, I have lost 2 SSD in that time. One was intel unfortunately I don't remember what the other was. It was on cheap side tho."
09-07-2020T17:46:32,CrRAR,The first SSDs I purchased were OCZs

09-07-2020T18:01:14,AspiringNoodle,Dude even joked at one point that he doesn't change the intro to his videos because he's Pavlovian conditioned us to recognize it

09-07-2020T18:02:50,CrRAR,GameGrumps did that

09-07-2020T21:07:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I hate hot sauce
09-07-2020T21:07:52,CrRAR,Hot honey is interesting
09-07-2020T21:07:58,AspiringNoodle,"""What kind of monster doesn't like hot sauce???"" -AspiringNoodle"

09-07-2020T21:08:46,BadFoMo,I'm not a fan of hot sause too.
09-07-2020T21:08:55,Mihari,"I would say it depends on the sauce, but largely, I'm with Kiwi"
09-07-2020T21:09:14,beastlee99,I've learned to get here an hour late but I guess that still isn't good enough lol
09-07-2020T21:09:15,AspiringNoodle,Who are you people and how do we even like the same things???
09-07-2020T21:09:20,CrRAR,"maybe if it's sweet spicy, gotta have a redeeming quality"
09-07-2020T21:09:22,CrimsonHelsing,"I like it, just hate it when I got sores in my mouth xP that's the worst"
09-07-2020T21:09:23,ZRO4825,Hot sauce is easily overdone.
09-07-2020T21:09:35,ZRO4825,Once you get past a certain point it's just hot and no flavor and that just sucks.
09-07-2020T21:09:38,CrRAR,Like if it's basically straight vinegar
09-07-2020T21:09:40,CrRAR,ew no
09-07-2020T21:09:56,CrRAR,Vinegar and pepper juice
09-07-2020T21:10:01,SpazztasticKiwi,there‚Äôs a hot wing we sell at the deli
09-07-2020T21:10:04,BlackjackSec99,I love Carolina Reaper sauces
09-07-2020T21:10:16,CrimsonHelsing,"I'd rather flavor over the ""spice"" pain"
09-07-2020T21:10:21,johnnytho,Ha my buddy ate that and puked
09-07-2020T21:10:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"it‚Äôs spicy but if given it, I‚Äôd eat a few"
09-07-2020T21:10:27,johnnytho,funny
09-07-2020T21:10:29,SerifGFont,Franks Red Hot Sauce is hard to over do
09-07-2020T21:10:42,SpazztasticKiwi,because they have more to them than the sauce
09-07-2020T21:10:51,SpazztasticKiwi,there‚Äôs spice and f l a v o r
09-07-2020T21:10:59,BlackjackSec99,"CrRAR, depends on your tolerances... Ive eaten a Reaper pepper. after that ""seriously hot"" hot sauces are kinda... eh?"
09-07-2020T21:11:01,CrRAR,yess
09-07-2020T21:11:05,SpazztasticKiwi,you can taste the chicken
09-07-2020T21:11:10,SageSaga,back finally
09-07-2020T21:11:12,AspiringNoodle,As someone who had a period of trying the hottest sauces available at restaurants
09-07-2020T21:11:13,CrRAR,wb
09-07-2020T21:11:19,johnnytho,WB sage
09-07-2020T21:11:30,AspiringNoodle,"After a certain point, they all taste like the same amorphous blend of peppers"
09-07-2020T21:11:35,SpazztasticKiwi,balance & variety - there‚Äôs a point where something is hot just to be hot
09-07-2020T21:11:42,CrRAR,tamarind is an underappreciated ingredient
09-07-2020T21:11:43,ZRO4825,wb Sage~
09-07-2020T21:11:48,CrRAR,balances spice out and is sweet
09-07-2020T21:11:53,johnnytho,tamarind candy is bomb
09-07-2020T21:11:54,SerifGFont,welcome back we are just talking about hot sauce
09-07-2020T21:11:54,AspiringNoodle,"Generally speaking, below 10,000 scovilles, there's a decent variety of flavors"
09-07-2020T21:12:03,AspiringNoodle,"But once you get to like, say, 25,000 or higher, pepper blend"
09-07-2020T21:12:16,BlackjackSec99,25k? thats it?
09-07-2020T21:12:25,CrRAR,schofeild levels
09-07-2020T21:12:32,AspiringNoodle,"Yup, because at that point it's more about adding hotter peppers"
09-07-2020T21:12:49,AspiringNoodle,"And even if you do add flavors, they might get drowned out just because peppers love to dominate flavor profiles :P"
09-07-2020T21:13:01,SpazztasticKiwi,but big mac sauce....I put it on everything I get at mcdonalds most of the time
09-07-2020T21:13:02,BlackjackSec99,"the difference in flavor between a ghost pepper, reaper, 7 pod, and scorpion are distinct and delicious"
09-07-2020T21:13:09,SpazztasticKiwi,even the ice cream
09-07-2020T21:13:24,CrRAR,I'm so glad they finally packaged it
09-07-2020T21:13:33,SageSaga,who wants to hear my hot sauce story again?
09-07-2020T21:13:38,AspiringNoodle,"That may be true, but I've tried several different hot sauces in the 100,000 - 300,000 range"
09-07-2020T21:13:42,AspiringNoodle,And they all tasted the same
09-07-2020T21:13:43,johnnytho,Say it

09-07-2020T23:28:52,Dadrobit,Ben Diskin is a top notch dubbing VA.
09-07-2020T23:29:09,Dadrobit,I think he even got an Emmy not too long ago.
09-07-2020T23:29:13,johnnytho,Ben is in BNA?
09-07-2020T23:29:17,Dadrobit,Or one of those awards.

09-07-2020T23:36:42,IronHorseComics,"his name's Stoney the Stoned Dragon, geeze, get it right"
09-07-2020T23:36:44,Ordithus,that's the name Trace gave him
09-07-2020T23:36:51,aeoronwah,ahh
09-07-2020T23:37:03,aeoronwah,I haven't read twokinds in a quite a while
09-07-2020T23:37:08,Dadrobit,Soney boi would retaiotoo much heat. My AC unit has enough trouble without having to overcome a walking bit of concrete that's constantly 100F inside the house.

09-07-2020T23:38:26,Ordithus,chill him down to 50 and enjoy

09-07-2020T23:38:54,SageSaga,yeah i should have said its the pet name the stone lizard was given rather than what people here call him
09-07-2020T23:38:57,KeefMcDerpface,"You're gonna need a lot of dry ice for that, no?"
09-07-2020T23:38:59,Dadrobit,"Right, I forgot I had a walk in freezer hidden in my house, how could I forget???"

09-07-2020T23:39:41,AspiringNoodle,Deal with the temp issues

09-07-2020T23:39:52,AspiringNoodle,^
09-07-2020T23:39:59,IronHorseComics,I called him Stoney before the comic did
09-07-2020T23:40:20,Ordithus,I suspect dadro does not have a basement
09-07-2020T23:40:22,CrimsonHelsing,same
09-07-2020T23:40:50,MuonNeutrino,it's interesting just how little actual linework is in a lot of these comic pages these days
09-07-2020T23:41:10,MuonNeutrino,"not that the pages are any simpler or less work, ofc, just that so much of it is in the painterly style tom does now"
09-07-2020T23:41:47,Dadrobit,I keep my walk in freezer in my basement of course!

09-07-2020T23:43:15,Dadrobit,100F is as cool as I was willing to go to keep it believable. I don't think people would take me seriously if I told them how hot stone/concrete actually got out here.
