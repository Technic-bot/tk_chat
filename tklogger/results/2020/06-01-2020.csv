06-01-2020T03:16:30,CrimsonQuill,'Mornin'
06-01-2020T05:05:28,AspiringNoodle,"Man, indecision is a beeyotch"
06-01-2020T05:15:59,CrimsonQuill,Hiya Nodle
06-01-2020T05:16:01,CrimsonQuill,Noodle
06-01-2020T05:16:13,CrimsonQuill,Still on a hunt?
06-01-2020T05:18:49,AspiringNoodle,Wrestling with inner demons on requesting reduced hours :P
06-01-2020T05:19:35,CrimsonQuill,"If you need them, I'd say go for it"
06-01-2020T05:19:41,CrimsonQuill,But I know the indecision
06-01-2020T05:19:55,CrimsonQuill,"(THough, thankfully, not yet at my job)"
06-01-2020T05:21:31,AspiringNoodle,I'm just frustrated with the amount of stuff that isn't in working order :/
06-01-2020T05:22:36,CrimsonQuill,I see
06-01-2020T05:22:52,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I took that exam of mine yesterday, and I've been told to relax."
06-01-2020T05:23:05,CrimsonQuill,So now I'm drawing my Halo Fireteam
06-01-2020T05:23:43,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-kingtea:
06-01-2020T05:24:10,AspiringNoodle,"So, on my list of new complaints"
06-01-2020T05:24:37,AspiringNoodle,"We have signs for ""Every day low price"" bs.  Generally it's some kind of buy 2 discount.  None of those ring up ever"
06-01-2020T05:24:53,AspiringNoodle,Almost NONE of the gas pumps can actually print a receipt
06-01-2020T05:25:21,CrimsonQuill,"I take it your management are still not as desired,"
06-01-2020T05:25:57,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, manager's fine.  He's still learning.  But corporate still being corporate and whatnot"
06-01-2020T05:26:22,CrimsonQuill,"That's what I meant, sorry"
06-01-2020T05:26:25,CrimsonQuill,Corporate
06-01-2020T05:27:09,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, I feel sorry for any manager we get"
06-01-2020T05:27:24,AspiringNoodle,"Corporate mandates that managers are scheduled for 48 hours a week, minimum"
06-01-2020T05:27:37,CrimsonQuill,Ouch.
06-01-2020T05:27:51,CrimsonQuill,And maximum?
06-01-2020T05:28:01,AspiringNoodle,"W/e the store needs, they're salaried at 48k a year"
06-01-2020T05:28:21,CrimsonQuill,W/e?
06-01-2020T05:28:25,AspiringNoodle,whatever
06-01-2020T05:28:32,CrimsonQuill,Oh
06-01-2020T05:28:47,CrimsonQuill,Well at least they have a somewhat decent wage for all they must go through...
06-01-2020T05:28:57,AspiringNoodle,But from a cashier standpoint
06-01-2020T05:29:10,CrimsonQuill,But it would be a lot nicer for you if Corporate actually didn't just look for Dollar Signs
06-01-2020T05:29:19,CrimsonQuill,Because you must have it very low
06-01-2020T05:29:23,AspiringNoodle,I'm just fed up with stuff not working proably
06-01-2020T05:29:29,AspiringNoodle,properly*
06-01-2020T05:29:40,CrimsonQuill,And it can't be repaired?
06-01-2020T05:29:51,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, it probably can, but good luck getting it done"
06-01-2020T05:30:14,AspiringNoodle,Those are literally my only requests
06-01-2020T05:30:26,AspiringNoodle,"Make sure specials fucking ring up, and that if something isn't working properly, FIX IT"
06-01-2020T05:30:53,AspiringNoodle,"I'm tired of having to remember, ""Oh yeah, these popular items are on sale this month"""
06-01-2020T05:30:59,CrimsonQuill,Whoof
06-01-2020T05:31:02,AspiringNoodle,I shouldn't HAVE to remember that certain stuff is on sale
06-01-2020T05:31:07,AspiringNoodle,IT SHOULD BE IN THE SYSTEM
06-01-2020T05:31:13,CrimsonQuill,And labelled too!
06-01-2020T05:31:22,AspiringNoodle,That's the huge fucking joke
06-01-2020T05:31:28,AspiringNoodle,"They send signs, they send sales planners"
06-01-2020T05:31:34,CrimsonQuill,Oh
06-01-2020T05:31:39,AspiringNoodle,Then the fucking sale isn't even in the fucking system for ringing people out
06-01-2020T05:31:52,CrimsonQuill,Well
06-01-2020T05:31:55,CrimsonQuill,Umm
06-01-2020T05:32:03,CrimsonQuill,Excuse me a moment
06-01-2020T05:32:13,AspiringNoodle,:P
06-01-2020T05:32:15,CrimsonQuill,ponders on the nature of corporate idiocy
06-01-2020T05:32:34,CrimsonQuill,lets out a cry of frustration at the nature of corporate idiocy
06-01-2020T05:32:51,CrimsonQuill,"Seriously, what the blazes?"
06-01-2020T05:33:24,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, it doesn't make it any less frustrating when it takes a week for the sale to finally register"
06-01-2020T05:33:46,AspiringNoodle,"Because that's happened.  A week after sales are in effect, they suddenly start ringing up"
06-01-2020T05:34:03,CrimsonQuill,Whaaaat
06-01-2020T05:35:52,AspiringNoodle,Here's why I'm frustrated
06-01-2020T05:36:15,AspiringNoodle,A short list of specials I need to remember so customers don't get pissed (and the chain has been on the decline for years)
06-01-2020T05:36:40,AspiringNoodle,"store brand gallon teas / lemonades, 2 for $5.  They ring up individually as $3.49"
06-01-2020T05:37:01,AspiringNoodle,"coke / 7up 20oz bottles, 2 for $3.33, ring up individually at $1.99"
06-01-2020T05:37:11,AspiringNoodle,pepsi 20oz 2 for $3.49
06-01-2020T05:37:30,AspiringNoodle,"King size reeses holiday pb cups, 2 for $3"
06-01-2020T05:37:37,CrimsonQuill,Wheesh
06-01-2020T05:37:39,AspiringNoodle,"hershey king size candy, 2 for $3.50"
06-01-2020T05:37:47,AspiringNoodle,And those are the ones I bother to remember for now
06-01-2020T05:37:50,CrimsonQuill,Bit pricey all that
06-01-2020T05:37:58,CrimsonQuill,And that's sale
06-01-2020T05:38:10,AspiringNoodle,"Know what, typing all this out... fuck the place, I'm requesting 3 days max xD"
06-01-2020T05:38:15,CrimsonQuill,And you have to remember all of those?
06-01-2020T05:38:18,CrimsonQuill,Wheesh.
06-01-2020T05:38:27,AspiringNoodle,I do it as a courtesy for the customers
06-01-2020T05:38:44,CrimsonQuill,So how goes a search for alternative careers?
06-01-2020T05:38:48,AspiringNoodle,"I actually give a flying fuck, and get irritated when I realize something's on sale and I overcharged someone"
06-01-2020T05:39:03,CrimsonQuill,That's a good trait to have for a cashier
06-01-2020T05:39:05,CrimsonQuill,Honest
06-01-2020T05:39:08,AspiringNoodle,"If I DO forget, sometimes they point it out"
06-01-2020T05:39:29,CrimsonQuill,And you're still treated like rubbish by Corporate.
06-01-2020T05:39:32,CrimsonQuill,Figures...
06-01-2020T05:39:58,AspiringNoodle,"I can tell you why the chain is on the decline, doesn't matter what corporation owns the chain, they probably don't have their shit together :/"
06-01-2020T05:41:31,AspiringNoodle,I'm hoping my 2nd job starts giving me consistent hours
06-01-2020T05:41:42,CrimsonQuill,Yeah.
06-01-2020T05:42:15,AspiringNoodle,"Money is basically the only reason I'm sticking around, and I think I could squeeze by working only 20 - 24 hours there"
06-01-2020T05:43:22,CrimsonQuill,I work 8 hour shifts at €10.00 an hour. Double on Sundays when I work then.
06-01-2020T05:43:38,CrimsonQuill,All my shifts are 12:00 midday to 8:00pm
06-01-2020T05:43:49,AspiringNoodle,The starting wage at the place is $9.50 an hour.  Turns out that the new company that bought the chain eliminated the $0.25 an hour raise after 3 months
06-01-2020T05:43:54,AspiringNoodle,So now raises are yearly only
06-01-2020T05:44:10,CrimsonQuill,I see.
06-01-2020T05:45:00,AspiringNoodle,And our schedules are a bit nonsensical due to the skimpy hours corporate gives the store
06-01-2020T05:45:16,CrimsonQuill,Jeepers.
06-01-2020T05:45:18,AspiringNoodle,"All I know is that I start at 2 at the earliest, and stay until 11 at the latest"
06-01-2020T05:45:48,CrimsonQuill,That's a hefty shift.
06-01-2020T05:45:59,AspiringNoodle,"Outside of holidays, I've had 2 - 8, 2 - 9, 2 - 10, 3 - 9, 3 - 10, 3 - 11, 3 - 10:30, 4 - 10:30"
06-01-2020T05:46:14,CrimsonQuill,All over the place...
06-01-2020T05:47:20,AspiringNoodle,"Aside from manning the store completely alone for 1.5 - 2.5 hours, I definitely prefer the later shifts"
06-01-2020T05:48:15,CrimsonQuill,I spend the last two hours of my shift alone finishing washing the dishes.
06-01-2020T05:48:49,AspiringNoodle,"If I'm ever on shift when the store gets robbed, they can find themselves a new cashier, haha"
06-01-2020T05:49:08,AspiringNoodle,Because I can guarantee it's gonna be in that window where I'm there alone
06-01-2020T05:50:03,AspiringNoodle,"Because, believe it or not, despite the gas station being in a relatively low crime area, and being literally 3 minutes from a police station, it's been robbed twice in the past few years"
06-01-2020T05:50:16,CrimsonQuill,That's bad...
06-01-2020T05:50:33,CrimsonQuill,"And if they were armed, it'd definitely be a rush out"
06-01-2020T05:50:59,CrimsonQuill,Unless you had something to stop 'em...
06-01-2020T05:51:28,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, no, completely open checkout.  employees can easily walk behind and out from the checkout"
06-01-2020T05:51:58,CrimsonQuill,Shoot
06-01-2020T05:52:15,AspiringNoodle,Other stores have had major robbery issues
06-01-2020T05:52:19,CrimsonQuill,"I'd say go for the nadgers, but I know that most robberies in the US are armed..."
06-01-2020T05:52:35,CrimsonQuill,And it'd be hard to go for the nadgers when the target has a gun
06-01-2020T05:52:44,AspiringNoodle,Mostly because our stores are small and don't have many employees at a given moment
06-01-2020T05:52:55,CrimsonQuill,Oof
06-01-2020T05:53:34,AspiringNoodle,"On the bright side, if I get shot, I'm pretty sure I could find some money-hungry lawyer to help me sue the chain for medical expenses / putting me in harms way ;)"
06-01-2020T05:54:18,CrimsonQuill,My parents often joke about how much the US has in terms of Suing...
06-01-2020T05:55:49,AspiringNoodle,The court system can more or less be broken up into 2 sides
06-01-2020T05:55:52,AspiringNoodle,"Criminal, and civil"
06-01-2020T05:56:14,AspiringNoodle,"Criminal is where they pursue legal punishment, civil is for damages"
06-01-2020T05:56:22,CrimsonQuill,I see.
06-01-2020T05:56:36,CrimsonQuill,So Judge Judy would be Civil court
06-01-2020T05:56:41,AspiringNoodle,Yes
06-01-2020T05:56:46,CrimsonQuill,Because she often handles lawsuits and stuff
06-01-2020T06:00:22,AspiringNoodle,I guess I do have one final complaint
06-01-2020T06:00:35,AspiringNoodle,"There's almost never a manager, in any capacity, on second shift"
06-01-2020T06:01:02,AspiringNoodle,"You know, someone who can make calls on what to do in unusual situations that lowly cashiers like me don't really have the authority to make"
06-01-2020T06:02:15,AspiringNoodle,"Also, glad to have this chat with you, definitely requesting 3 days at most today xD"
06-01-2020T06:02:16,CrimsonQuill,That's dog dinner
06-01-2020T06:02:21,CrimsonQuill,That's ok
06-01-2020T06:02:38,AspiringNoodle,Dog dinner?  I have never heard this phrase and would like to know more :D
06-01-2020T06:03:19,CrimsonQuill,"""Try not to make a dog's dinner of this"""
06-01-2020T06:03:23,CrimsonQuill,That sorta phrase
06-01-2020T06:04:40,AspiringNoodle,"HAHAHA, google does not disappoint"
06-01-2020T06:04:54,AspiringNoodle,Dog dinner synonym's: clusterfuck
06-01-2020T06:05:07,CrimsonQuill,XD
06-01-2020T06:12:38,AspiringNoodle,"The closest we have is one of my coworkers, who his shift supervisor, but he's working roughly the same amount that I want to go down to"
06-01-2020T06:13:00,AspiringNoodle,"And even then, he needs to call managers just like the rest of us in weird situations"
06-01-2020T06:13:23,CrimsonQuill,Ideally there should be a manager on almost all of the time
06-01-2020T06:13:44,CrimsonQuill,Or at least you should be able to do some of the things you need to without one.
06-01-2020T06:14:10,AspiringNoodle,"It's a bit difficult, given that the station is open 24/7, but given that they only want a single person on shift at night, and they might get 10 people at most, it's not unreasonable"
06-01-2020T06:21:07,AspiringNoodle,"But yeah... I can only describe this job as suitable for someone who needs the cash (me, somewhat), or wants to kill time"
06-01-2020T06:24:22,AspiringNoodle,"Also, I was much happier those few weeks where I was only scheduled for 3 days.  But that's enough ranting about the job :P"
06-01-2020T06:24:48,CrimsonQuill,True
06-01-2020T06:24:51,CrimsonQuill,So
06-01-2020T06:25:00,CrimsonQuill,Anything cool happen lately?
06-01-2020T06:25:40,AspiringNoodle,Not really :3
06-01-2020T06:29:32,AspiringNoodle,Probably gonna go to the casino today to unwind after that last week
06-01-2020T06:30:25,CrimsonQuill,Not my style that
06-01-2020T06:30:32,CrimsonQuill,After the exam I'm doodling
06-01-2020T06:30:43,CrimsonQuill,I'm just going to draw a pic of my Halo fireteam relaxing
06-01-2020T06:30:53,CrimsonQuill,And upload some old sketch concepts I have to Deviantart
06-01-2020T06:30:58,CrimsonQuill,Because why not?
06-01-2020T06:31:51,AspiringNoodle,"I'm not gonna go crazy,lol"
06-01-2020T06:32:07,AspiringNoodle,Probably gonna go in with $20 and not lose any more than that
06-01-2020T06:32:18,CrimsonQuill,Aheh
06-01-2020T06:32:26,CrimsonQuill,Good idea
06-01-2020T06:32:39,AspiringNoodle,"I'm too cautious a person, lol"
06-01-2020T06:32:53,AspiringNoodle,"I more or less will play a slot's max lines, but not touch the multipliers"
06-01-2020T06:33:19,CrimsonQuill,I just doodle
06-01-2020T06:33:26,CrimsonQuill,Or rot my brain on my computer
06-01-2020T06:33:29,CrimsonQuill,Or listen to music
06-01-2020T06:33:43,CrimsonQuill,Or stare at the cieling trying to motivate myself to do something
06-01-2020T06:34:13,AspiringNoodle,I'm just gonna try to enjoy today before I go back to work for 4 days in a row
06-01-2020T06:34:55,AspiringNoodle,And next week I also do my bi-monthly work for the other guy
06-01-2020T06:35:05,AspiringNoodle,Which means next week I work 5 days out of 7
06-01-2020T06:35:14,CrimsonQuill,Wheesh
06-01-2020T06:35:26,AspiringNoodle,ANOTHER reason I'm trying to knock down
06-01-2020T06:38:54,AspiringNoodle,Huh... looks like I'm FINALLY getting tired
06-01-2020T06:38:58,AspiringNoodle,Maybe now I can go to bed :D
