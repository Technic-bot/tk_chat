31-08-2020T20:58:30,SpazztasticKiwi,they are nice quality - the box doubles as a display case PLUS they all come with a matte protective sleeve with a matching design scheme
31-08-2020T20:59:46,SpazztasticKiwi,plus mark is one of those with alot of sway and a good influence on his crowd

31-08-2020T21:08:23,SpazztasticKiwi,and they either forgoed Tim or let him out for being 5+ something years old
31-08-2020T21:09:28,SpazztasticKiwi,though it looks like they decided to pair Mark with the known pink scheme/mustache & chica
31-08-2020T21:14:51,CrRAR,it is funny how irregular it is for little figurines and custom stuff to be made with such big online communities especially now.
