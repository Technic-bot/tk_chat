11-06-2020T00:06:46,CrRAR,:rabbit2::rabbit2::rabbit::rabbit2::ptv-excited:
11-06-2020T00:07:17,CrRAR,"dunno why one is just a disembodied head, but it's 2020"
11-06-2020T00:07:21,CrRAR,"so, ehhh"
11-06-2020T00:25:12,SpazztasticKiwi,they become stronger
11-06-2020T00:25:15,SpazztasticKiwi,üê∞
11-06-2020T00:27:18,CrRAR,"so much think, the body shrink"
11-06-2020T00:27:32,CrRAR,till it goes *plink* :fireworks:
11-06-2020T00:31:53,CrRAR,"ey, sage hath joined the group"
11-06-2020T00:32:04,CrRAR,gooood evening
11-06-2020T00:32:11,CrRAR,good sir
11-06-2020T00:52:36,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-sytheeyebrows:
11-06-2020T00:54:45,SpazztasticKiwi,are the eyebrows getting faster or is that me
11-06-2020T00:55:00,SpazztasticKiwi,has anybody edited that one to do
11-06-2020T00:55:07,SpazztasticKiwi,that yet
11-06-2020T01:00:28,Twokinds,I think there's a super fast one somewhere
11-06-2020T01:01:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder if I‚Äôve seen it from things
11-06-2020T01:02:06,SpazztasticKiwi,how would a bed hog flora sketch do to everyone
11-06-2020T01:02:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I can‚Äôt see it being popular but it‚Äôs a fun idea
11-06-2020T01:05:28,AspiringNoodle,Only if the baby is the one who kicked Trace out of bed :ptv-snicker:
11-06-2020T01:06:34,Dadrobit,The night... Is dragging... So much ass...
11-06-2020T01:08:09,Dadrobit,Looked up the game from earlier. Evidently it'll be a gay love story thing. Best of luck to them. They're getting absolutely shat on right now.
11-06-2020T01:09:47,AspiringNoodle,Which game?
11-06-2020T01:09:59,Dadrobit,Goodbye Volcano High.
11-06-2020T01:10:07,Dadrobit,Next gen PS game.
11-06-2020T01:10:27,Dadrobit,Already was in for a rough time since it's furry.
11-06-2020T01:10:42,AspiringNoodle,"Was about to say, looks cute~"
11-06-2020T01:10:49,SpazztasticKiwi,they all look like dragon dinos tho
11-06-2020T01:11:07,Dadrobit,It looked charming.
11-06-2020T01:11:52,AspiringNoodle,"Looking at the comments, it seems like a lot of the criticism is aimed at the gameplay"
11-06-2020T01:11:52,Dadrobit,Their Twitter is having a meltdown. Evidently it's the same for Discord.
11-06-2020T01:12:36,AspiringNoodle,"I've seen a few games in recent years that are labelled as ""woke"", and the biggest problem was that they weren't actually games.  Good ones, anyways."
11-06-2020T01:13:02,AspiringNoodle,"Iirc, the name of one such game was called ""Where the Water Tastes Like Wine"""
11-06-2020T01:13:18,Dadrobit,They should probably learn from the Sean Murray School of Shutting Up and Getting Work Done until release.
11-06-2020T01:13:20,AspiringNoodle,"Had an interesting premise, but the gameplay is just flippin' awful..."
11-06-2020T01:14:29,Dadrobit,Being communicative on Twitter and Discord's probably just gonna encourage the trolls that much more and hurt the development.
11-06-2020T01:16:23,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, yeah, just watched the reveal trailer, lol"
11-06-2020T01:16:27,AspiringNoodle,"""This is a game?"""
11-06-2020T01:16:44,AspiringNoodle,"Like, it looks like the story might be interesting, but it seemed more like a Netflix trailer than a game trailer"
11-06-2020T01:18:16,Dadrobit,"And yeah, them coming out the gate with ""look at our nonheteronormative character!"" Has me worried."
11-06-2020T01:19:11,CrRAR,"Yeah, the jump to making that appeal is a bit forward"
11-06-2020T01:19:38,Dadrobit,"Way too often it feels super fake. Like the characters are caricatures of nonheteronormative people, rather than believable characters who are nonheteronormative. Ya know?"
11-06-2020T01:20:12,CrRAR,"Yeah, like, just let them be who they are lol"
11-06-2020T01:21:01,AspiringNoodle,It's the classic #TokenCharacter
11-06-2020T01:21:55,AspiringNoodle,"When you shout ""HEY, LOOK AT THIS CHARACTER, THEY'RE DIFFERENT BUT THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE THEY'RE AWESOME AND JUNK!"" you immediately invite intense scrutiny to your creation"
11-06-2020T01:23:11,AspiringNoodle,"Some people will immediately jump on the bandwagon to support the creator, some will dislike the work immediately because they're already giving a megaphone to the non-straight person, and some will wonder if the creators are being genuine"
11-06-2020T01:24:12,AspiringNoodle,"And given how hyper-politicized the world is at the moment, nuance is key"
11-06-2020T01:26:13,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs like when you don‚Äôt get that Neil‚Äôs brother Mitch is gay until the end in paranorman
11-06-2020T01:26:22,SpazztasticKiwi,he‚Äôs a normal dude
11-06-2020T01:29:09,AspiringNoodle,^^^
11-06-2020T01:29:25,AspiringNoodle,PERFECTLY written character
11-06-2020T01:29:58,AspiringNoodle,It's sad that we currently live in a world where some people immediately hate a character for orientation / w/e
11-06-2020T01:30:18,AspiringNoodle,And then there are those who get upset if your character doesn't fit their definition of LGBT-ness
11-06-2020T01:31:13,AspiringNoodle,"Prime example: The one holiday comic from, I believe it was Valentines?, featuring Nat and Sealeen"
11-06-2020T01:36:11,Dadrobit,"Wait, what?"
11-06-2020T01:53:25,Dadrobit,I'm not going crazy right? There's not some unposted Natani x Sealeen Valentine's comic that caught flak going under my radar?
11-06-2020T01:53:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm curious on what was up with my tonsils last night
11-06-2020T01:54:05,SpazztasticKiwi,right was swollen left got soreish later and then poof gone hours later
11-06-2020T01:54:19,SpazztasticKiwi,google said oooooohhh that sounds like cancer
11-06-2020T01:54:23,AspiringNoodle,"The jist of the comic was Sealeen used a potion that could capture any ""MAN'S"" heart"
11-06-2020T01:54:33,AspiringNoodle,And she used it on Nat
11-06-2020T01:54:57,AspiringNoodle,And that gotten people from a certain political camp in a tizzy
11-06-2020T01:55:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I give up
11-06-2020T01:55:23,SpazztasticKiwi,tf you talking about
11-06-2020T01:55:34,AspiringNoodle,Something that was barely a blip on the radar :P
11-06-2020T01:55:49,Dadrobit,"Oh, I remember that. I thought there was some side comic where Natani and Sealeen hooked up."
11-06-2020T01:56:09,AspiringNoodle,"Like, TBF, it didn't have a raving mob come after Tom"
11-06-2020T01:56:13,AspiringNoodle,So I'd consider it a non-issue
11-06-2020T01:57:36,AspiringNoodle,"And Kiwi, have you heard of Medical Students' disease?"
11-06-2020T01:57:43,AspiringNoodle,Google'll give you that :ptv-hearts:
11-06-2020T01:58:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn‚Äôt put much care into it
11-06-2020T02:06:35,CrRAR,Maybe a really mean rogue piece of dust
11-06-2020T02:07:16,SpazztasticKiwi,what‚Äôs the best breaded chicken from a store you guys have had
11-06-2020T02:08:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I figure since it was my right side and that‚Äôs what I woke up on it was the night air and fan moving it around
11-06-2020T02:08:23,AspiringNoodle,Hmmm
11-06-2020T02:08:37,AspiringNoodle,I do like Perdue chicken strips~
11-06-2020T02:08:39,AspiringNoodle,Nice and meaty :D
11-06-2020T02:09:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"it cools nicely at night after 70, 80, or 90 degrees in the day so I open my window in the evening a crack & let it stay that way maybe once or twice"
11-06-2020T02:09:42,CrRAR,:fog::bread::ccrrar-chickcr:
11-06-2020T02:09:45,CrRAR,bread dat chik‚Äôn
11-06-2020T02:09:50,SpazztasticKiwi,any other time my fans just on & the windows closed so it was just my laying in one position for a long time
11-06-2020T02:09:56,SpazztasticKiwi,in cold air
11-06-2020T02:10:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôd gone to bed quite earlier than usual cause I hadn‚Äôt slept, they‚Äôd filled me in for a full shift early, and it was move move move all day when I was there"
11-06-2020T02:12:40,CrRAR,The expectations at work
11-06-2020T02:12:58,CrRAR,:middle_finger:
11-06-2020T02:13:10,CrRAR,Are too dang high
11-06-2020T02:13:43,CrRAR,"Also, that was supposed to be a fist"
11-06-2020T02:14:21,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs what woke me up not two hours later because I guess my brain was like ‚Äúthroat hurt. might be suffocating. check that out‚Äù
11-06-2020T02:14:35,SpazztasticKiwi,google suggested tylonal for swelling so after that wonderful wake up call I took some and finally got to where I could get back to sleep again
11-06-2020T02:14:56,SpazztasticKiwi,only to be woke back up another few hours later by work on my day off
11-06-2020T02:15:34,CrRAR,aaarg
11-06-2020T02:16:30,SpazztasticKiwi,it wasn‚Äôt my manager‚Äôs fault - they had a order missing with a customer & just needed to ask me about it
11-06-2020T02:18:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"after being up a little longer there, i rolled back over and debated the lure of turning my phone on airplane mode for the foreseeable future"
11-06-2020T02:19:22,CrRAR,Good deed for the day
11-06-2020T02:19:33,CrRAR,Achieved
11-06-2020T02:19:57,SpazztasticKiwi,what I didn‚Äôt get was google like ‚Äúo yeah that could be cancer right there‚Äù
11-06-2020T02:20:30,SpazztasticKiwi,you‚Äôre telling me my tonsils decided in the spanse of 2 hours ‚Äúimma kill her‚Äù
11-06-2020T02:21:02,CrRAR,If it persists or recurs asking a doctor ain‚Äôt bad
11-06-2020T02:21:16,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah it also suggests strep
11-06-2020T02:21:52,CrRAR,"Yeah, you can get a tinge of something and ir can just poof as quick"
11-06-2020T02:22:17,CrRAR,Immune system being a bro
11-06-2020T02:22:27,CrRAR,Or broette
11-06-2020T02:22:35,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs horrible because it feels like a blob of peanut butter stuck right behind your tongue on the side of your throat
11-06-2020T02:23:40,SpazztasticKiwi,gag reflex territory but mine is close to unresponsive for some reason so it was just persistently and annoyingly uncomfortable
11-06-2020T02:23:56,CrRAR,Benedryl is good at dealling with allergic type reactions
11-06-2020T02:24:05,CrRAR,Makes sleepy tho
11-06-2020T02:24:56,CrRAR,Dentists are pretty keen to watvh for weird mouth stuff
11-06-2020T02:25:05,CrRAR,Any appointment soon?
11-06-2020T02:26:04,SpazztasticKiwi,some of those benedryls can boil down to don‚Äôt feel it anymore but now you feel worse cause it‚Äôs got that haven‚Äôt-slept-in-days feel
11-06-2020T02:26:12,SpazztasticKiwi,6 month is in july
11-06-2020T02:26:54,CrRAR,That‚Äôs not too far
11-06-2020T02:27:23,SpazztasticKiwi,oh and I didn‚Äôt have a fever
11-06-2020T02:27:39,SpazztasticKiwi,so it wasn‚Äôt infection territory
11-06-2020T02:28:11,CrRAR,oh good
11-06-2020T02:28:11,SpazztasticKiwi,unless I had a low one or something cause I didn‚Äôt feel warm
11-06-2020T02:29:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I was legitimately just mildly inconvenience because it was uncomfortable and I was tired and it had woke me up
11-06-2020T02:30:51,SpazztasticKiwi,wasn‚Äôt exited about if it continued it could be some form of tonsillitis & I‚Äôd have to get them removed but
11-06-2020T02:31:30,CrRAR,"Yeah, I feel like it‚Äôs happened to me a few times where I swear I‚Äôd be getting strep or whatever then once I‚Äôm up it goes away, not usually to wake me up in the middle of night tho"
11-06-2020T02:31:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"me tired, me want sleep - the fact that the worlds on fire outside can wait"
11-06-2020T02:31:54,CrRAR,yeh
11-06-2020T02:32:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll tell you what never to do
11-06-2020T02:32:42,SpazztasticKiwi,drink water - never cold water - and sleep in front of a fan
11-06-2020T02:33:29,CrRAR,ok
11-06-2020T02:33:41,CrRAR,A cautionary tale
11-06-2020T02:33:55,SpazztasticKiwi,wake up sounding like Mark when he had that sinus flu thing
11-06-2020T02:34:26,SpazztasticKiwi,throat feeling like it‚Äôs lined with sandpaper & rocks
11-06-2020T02:35:14,CrRAR,Was it korea... that years ago said no one should sleep with fans on at night or something?
11-06-2020T02:35:35,CrRAR,They must have done the science
11-06-2020T02:36:35,CrRAR,"There is so much pollen too these days, even if not allergic it‚Äôs like in plumes, so gross."
11-06-2020T02:36:41,AspiringNoodle,It's more of a superstition than anything else
11-06-2020T02:36:56,CrRAR,Yeah that‚Äôs what I thought
11-06-2020T02:37:22,AspiringNoodle,The worst the fan will do is increase the rate at which you dehydrate in warmer times due to the air wicking away sweat
11-06-2020T02:37:40,AspiringNoodle,"And it's more of an issue in warmer enclosed rooms, no openings, than anything else"
11-06-2020T02:38:10,AspiringNoodle,"But again, they're very superstitious.  To the point that fans have automatic shut-off timers"
11-06-2020T02:38:46,Dadrobit,"Huh, it would appear Tom never posted the comic with Sealeen and Natani? I can't find it anymore at least."
11-06-2020T02:41:50,AspiringNoodle,The one with the potion was definitely on Twitter
11-06-2020T02:43:02,Dadrobit,"I mean, I found it in unmentionable locales. But it has no official posting on DeviantArt or Patreon."
11-06-2020T02:47:51,Dadrobit,"And on Twitter, it's only the preview. No full showings."
11-06-2020T02:57:53,SpazztasticKiwi,there‚Äôs plenty of people that like to spice Tom‚Äôs posts up
11-06-2020T02:58:14,SpazztasticKiwi,either surface edits or complete rearranging
11-06-2020T02:59:08,Dadrobit,Panel shuffles are definitely a thing. The panel shuffle thread on the forums is literally hundreds of pages long.
11-06-2020T03:00:02,Dadrobit,"Heck, even I have a couple posts in there."
11-06-2020T03:00:20,SpazztasticKiwi,like that dark line door in the middle of the woods there‚Äôs just some things you gotta say nah to
11-06-2020T03:00:27,SpazztasticKiwi,lone
11-06-2020T03:02:49,Dadrobit,I actually don't recall if I've ever stopped low enough to do a bpt edit:
11-06-2020T03:03:30,Dadrobit,But I do remember one where Maddie got curious about Reni and her... Womanliness...
11-06-2020T03:07:35,Dadrobit,I definitely did some censor bar edits tho.
11-06-2020T03:09:20,AspiringNoodle,Night random peoples :D
11-06-2020T03:11:15,Dadrobit,G'night
11-06-2020T03:22:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt get the whole MAKE EM NAKED parade
11-06-2020T03:22:56,SpazztasticKiwi,the thirst is exhausting after awhile but maybe it‚Äôs because I have a preference for men
11-06-2020T03:30:01,SpazztasticKiwi,night Tom

11-06-2020T09:10:01,AspiringNoodle,RIP
11-06-2020T09:20:12,AspiringNoodle,I officially curse my birth name.  Why?  Because it has the most effing repititious series of motions ever and its annoying AF.  Worst signature name possible -_-
11-06-2020T09:20:58,AspiringNoodle,"Also eff cursive in general, lol"
11-06-2020T09:47:18,CrRAR,"Eh, signatures are such a formality now"
11-06-2020T09:47:36,CrRAR,I almost feel like signatures are going the way of fax machines
11-06-2020T09:48:19,CrRAR,"Like, there will be the few institutions that require them still but there‚Äôs SO MUCH that happens now without signatures"
11-06-2020T09:48:53,CrRAR,"Like online bank accounts, taxes, everything is moving towards ‚Äòdigital‚Äô signatures."
11-06-2020T09:49:04,CrRAR,Which you don‚Äôt even actuall ‚Äòsign‚Äô
11-06-2020T09:49:11,CrRAR,y

11-06-2020T15:19:53,Dadrobit,I predict that even digital signatures are on the way out.
11-06-2020T15:20:24,Dadrobit,I think we're going to see a movement towards fingerprint scanners just being a routine method of verification.
11-06-2020T15:21:26,Dadrobit,Even GameStop had them when I went in a few months back for a Switch.
11-06-2020T15:23:50,Rainelover,?
11-06-2020T15:32:07,AspiringNoodle,Rant from earlier today
11-06-2020T15:32:30,AspiringNoodle,"I was putting my signature on my resignation letter, and my birth name is SUUUUUUUUUUUPER annoying to sign for"
11-06-2020T15:34:19,AspiringNoodle,"Like, I've gotten to the point where the latter half of both names devolves into scribbles just because of the travel time for the pen at that point"
11-06-2020T15:37:41,AspiringNoodle,I understand celebrity signatures so much now...
11-06-2020T15:42:12,Rainelover,"Oh lord, must be tough"
11-06-2020T15:48:37,AspiringNoodle,Maybe I'm just whiny :P
11-06-2020T15:49:29,AspiringNoodle,I find it funny that some states are still fighting for cursive to be taught in school
11-06-2020T15:49:57,AspiringNoodle,"It's like, why?  Literally the ONLY thing you use it for for ""the rest of your life"" is signatures, and even then all you need to learn is the letters for YOUR name"
11-06-2020T15:50:39,AspiringNoodle,"We waste a good portion of an entire year of schooling on this subject.  Could be better spent on math, science, or history"
11-06-2020T15:52:09,Rainelover,And even then you can literally just put an illegible scribble as your signature and they will accept it just the same
11-06-2020T16:02:44,AspiringNoodle,I guess that's another thing!
11-06-2020T16:02:56,AspiringNoodle,Do they *really* check signatures anymore?  Truly *really* really?
11-06-2020T16:03:37,Dadrobit,"I feel like the sentiment ""I don't use (skill) taught to me in school, so that time was useless"" is missing the point."
11-06-2020T16:05:15,Dadrobit,The skill isn't the point most of the time. It's teaching the students HOW to learn and work towards completing tasks even when they don't necessarily want to. That's the major skill really being taught in grade school.
11-06-2020T16:06:31,Dadrobit,It's missing the forest for the trees as it were.
11-06-2020T16:07:44,AspiringNoodle,"Otoh, America's schooling system is way behind other nations :)"

11-06-2020T22:58:39,Roughlandin,...Is that the dragon one?
11-06-2020T22:58:44,Roughlandin,On netflix?

11-06-2020T22:59:24,NezumiYuki,LOL okay
11-06-2020T22:59:31,Roughlandin,...The vore stans will remember that
11-06-2020T22:59:45,SageSaga,it suggests that lesbians dont really love each other

11-06-2020T23:00:37,KeefMcDerpface,bye johnny (?)
11-06-2020T23:00:39,SageSaga,so if a pilot falls in love with a guy they stop working together- the dragon even tries to eat them
11-06-2020T23:00:45,KeefMcDerpface,Oh nevermind.
11-06-2020T23:00:47,johnnytho,nah im listening bro
11-06-2020T23:00:51,SageSaga,but not when the person is a lesbian for some reason-
11-06-2020T23:01:05,SageSaga,yet they insist its because of love so thus- lesbians dont really love each other
11-06-2020T23:01:17,Ordithus,sounds like some weird author's weird fantasy
11-06-2020T23:01:17,NezumiYuki,da fek?!?!
11-06-2020T23:01:33,Roughlandin,Yeah. Some guy was really into lessy-beans and vore

11-06-2020T23:01:40,Ordithus,still making the big bucks :ctwokinds-adiracoin:
11-06-2020T23:01:41,SageSaga,so either it was a poor translation- or maybe dragons like lesbians and are thus ok with it-
11-06-2020T23:01:47,NezumiYuki,Okay well my curiosity about that dragon series just went down the toilet!....
11-06-2020T23:01:59,Roughlandin,I just came here for the cute durgums!
11-06-2020T23:02:15,SageSaga,"but its not explained or explored so it just leaves you with the answer ""lesbians must not actually love each other"""

11-06-2020T23:06:58,SageSaga,"I think my only issues with the Space Force show are- 1 - The daughter character is really annoying, 2 - The ending was really weird- it seemed like it cut short- maybe Covid issues? And 3 - Characters sometimes be TOO stupid..."
11-06-2020T23:07:14,Rainelover,is happy that big oof has been avoided
11-06-2020T23:07:14,Roughlandin,I've heard mixed things about it

11-06-2020T23:32:10,CrRAR,sage is a man of deliberate action!
11-06-2020T23:32:15,Ordithus,it's a useful skill
11-06-2020T23:32:17,NezumiYuki,Oh dear this complicates things a bit for me... I know another person with a july 4th b-day... making something for Mihari too might stretch my art time to the limit
11-06-2020T23:32:20,Ordithus,I swear
11-06-2020T23:32:26,Roughlandin,Dang it. Now I've got an old Jason Mraz song stuck in my head.
11-06-2020T23:33:23,SageSaga,I know what she would want from me- if i were Tom XD
11-06-2020T23:33:47,DarthRexKing,"Song, sage?"

11-06-2020T23:34:11,SageSaga,she wants a picture of her DnD character token in the same style Tom did for his
11-06-2020T23:34:16,Roughlandin,Oooooh
11-06-2020T23:34:17,RimaDraws,i didn't get to draw her anything last year
11-06-2020T23:34:25,CrRAR,nice
11-06-2020T23:34:34,Roughlandin,Tom D&D painting style
11-06-2020T23:34:51,Ordithus,that would be pretty sweet
11-06-2020T23:35:03,SageSaga,current song playing is JUSTadICE
11-06-2020T23:35:09,NezumiYuki,Dang it... half a month... gotta think of something for speed kitty... not much time...
11-06-2020T23:35:10,SageSaga,previous song was Black Rover
11-06-2020T23:35:36,Roughlandin,"Or he could take like a full week and make a Lo-Fi Mihari pic for her with, like, a bajillion easter eggs in the background"
11-06-2020T23:35:43,Roughlandin,hehehe
11-06-2020T23:35:58,KeefMcDerpface,Oh gosh.
11-06-2020T23:36:14,SageSaga,XD the Token would be what she wants- because she told me she would love to have one painted by him like that XD
11-06-2020T23:36:23,NezumiYuki,Hey that's a funky idea!  Heh Lo Fi Mihari!
11-06-2020T23:36:51,Roughlandin,Any excuse for more of Tom's more realistic D&D style
11-06-2020T23:36:54,RimaDraws,that would be cool
11-06-2020T23:36:54,Ordithus,:eyes: Tom should do the full party like that
11-06-2020T23:37:11,Roughlandin,*nudge nudge wink wink*
11-06-2020T23:37:52,NezumiYuki,I wonder of playing off of FluffyKevlar's Mihari pic would be in bad taste?
