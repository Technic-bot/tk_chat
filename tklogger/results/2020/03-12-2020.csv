03-12-2020T00:20:34,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-EmberHide:
03-12-2020T00:20:38,CrRAR,Maybe it’s for those special situations that you boyfriend absconded with your brother?
03-12-2020T00:21:27,CrRAR,Like a tender breakup... and well wishing card~
03-12-2020T00:22:04,Ordithus,"maybe it's your brother, his boyfriend"
03-12-2020T00:22:09,Ordithus,because if it isn't
03-12-2020T00:23:11,CrRAR,"“...America, we need to tawlk...”"
03-12-2020T00:23:24,CrRAR,*pulls out chair*
03-12-2020T00:33:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I finally watched Marks flashlight video
03-12-2020T00:34:01,CrRAR,hehheh
03-12-2020T00:34:16,CrRAR,Were you concerned?
03-12-2020T00:34:28,CrRAR,cuz I was
03-12-2020T00:34:35,CrRAR,A weeee bit xD
03-12-2020T00:34:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve got the inkling of a feeling he wasn’t always talking about flashlights
03-12-2020T00:35:30,CrRAR,"Yeahhh, a bit colorful with the language"
03-12-2020T00:36:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"all Amy’s perspective was mark going into some closet with a bunch of flashlights & watching the light show under the door while he mutters about brightness, sunglasses, and the vivitch"
03-12-2020T00:38:44,CrRAR,It was a compelling demonstration
03-12-2020T00:39:32,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz: nini
03-12-2020T00:39:42,CrRAR,:v: ord

03-12-2020T00:45:46,CrRAR,Did you see that movie? Was it along the lines of like the Conjuring films?
03-12-2020T00:46:08,CrRAR,Like respective of retro horror enough to be enjoyable?
03-12-2020T00:47:38,SpazztasticKiwi,what movie
03-12-2020T00:48:03,CrRAR,The Vvitch
03-12-2020T00:49:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I took it as half mark nonsense and half not interested
03-12-2020T00:49:34,CrRAR,ah
03-12-2020T00:50:10,CrRAR,"haha, yeap just interjected ramblings of a flashlight crazed man"
03-12-2020T00:51:31,SpazztasticKiwi,unus annus took so much out of him he doesn’t know what to do with himself
03-12-2020T00:51:54,CrRAR,Journey of rediscovery~
03-12-2020T00:52:43,CrRAR,Plus probably inspired by the escapades in Plasmophobia
03-12-2020T00:57:58,SpazztasticKiwi,taco bag make good crackles
03-12-2020T00:58:30,CrRAR,Bagheera doing more exploring?

03-12-2020T00:59:18,CrRAR,Got to cheeeckk alll de cornersss
03-12-2020T00:59:43,CrRAR,"Nope, nope, nopenope"
03-12-2020T01:01:33,CrRAR,Yeah 1st impresion of the flashlight video I swore he walked in wearing a onesie looking thing cuz of the camera quality haha
03-12-2020T01:01:44,CrRAR,added to my intrigue
03-12-2020T01:02:58,Dadrobit,Boyo lemme tell ya. First thing I see in the chat was Spazz talking about watching Mark with his flashlight video.
03-12-2020T01:03:22,Dadrobit,"And lemme tell ya, I did sure missread ""flashlight"""
03-12-2020T01:03:37,Dadrobit,I did me a hearty concern
03-12-2020T01:04:35,CrRAR,"Ohhh noo, lol the ghost of chats’ past STRIKES"
03-12-2020T01:07:01,CrRAR,I can’t believe the bag has not yet been completely destroyed
03-12-2020T01:07:34,CrRAR,Maybe baghera figure that as long as the bag exists so does hope for delicious tacos?
03-12-2020T01:07:49,CrRAR,*bagheera
03-12-2020T01:08:07,Dadrobit,Taco.... Thursday?
03-12-2020T01:08:25,CrRAR,"It happened, yup"
03-12-2020T01:10:05,Dadrobit,"Man.... I really could go for a good taco right about now, now that you mention it...."
03-12-2020T01:10:23,SpazztasticKiwi,if you watch the video there’s possibility he’s hinting at what your brain saw
03-12-2020T01:10:24,CrRAR,"Honestly, yeahhhhh"
03-12-2020T01:10:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera has abandoned the bag again for the moment to put my leg to sleep
03-12-2020T01:10:58,Dadrobit,"Like, not one of those 50 cent ones from Filibertos. Like, one from a nice sit down Mexican restaurant."
03-12-2020T01:11:12,CrRAR,Hec yeah
03-12-2020T01:11:29,Dadrobit,Fuck.... It's been forever since I've been to any restaurant.
03-12-2020T01:12:04,CrRAR,"Yeah just take out like pizza, chinese, indian so far here"
03-12-2020T01:12:32,CrRAR,I did go for burgers a couple times when it was warm enough
03-12-2020T01:12:39,CrRAR,To be outside
03-12-2020T01:13:19,Dadrobit,I think the last place I sat down in was White Castle?
03-12-2020T01:14:39,Dadrobit,"It was alright. White Castle is always good on its own merits, but it was an hour wait in line because it was still so new to AZ."
03-12-2020T01:15:13,CrRAR,What area are they more native to?
03-12-2020T01:15:44,CrRAR,"Jack in the box is more south, right?"
03-12-2020T01:16:03,CrRAR,What about in-n-out burger is that western?
03-12-2020T01:16:47,CrRAR,I feel like the SW is it’s own little fifedom.
03-12-2020T01:17:03,Dadrobit,The White Castle out here in Scottsdale is pretty much the first one further West than The Mississippi. But it's super popular on the East Coast.
03-12-2020T01:17:50,CrRAR,"Huh, maybe NJ on down"
03-12-2020T01:17:57,Dadrobit,"We have a ton of Jack in the Box out here. They are very tasty. In and Out is here as well, but I don't go too often because they always have an absurd line."
03-12-2020T01:18:26,Dadrobit,"First White Castle I had was in NY, on Long Island."
03-12-2020T01:18:35,AspiringNoodle,Wish we had a White Castle xD
03-12-2020T01:18:40,AspiringNoodle,At least we got Popeyes ._.
03-12-2020T01:19:22,Dadrobit,"They sell frozen White Castle sliders in big box stores, but they're not quite the real thing."
03-12-2020T01:19:38,CrRAR,Yeah I’ve seen those
03-12-2020T01:20:15,CrRAR,That is crazy like none forever then like one dot in AZ
03-12-2020T01:20:26,CrRAR,Lots in the midwest looks like
03-12-2020T01:20:36,CrRAR,NJ/NY are a ton
03-12-2020T01:20:40,Dadrobit,"No joke, my grandaddy used to use them as stuffing. The frozen ones. He'd just throw them in a blender and and boom, Thanksgiving stuffing."
03-12-2020T01:20:55,CrRAR,Special recipe
03-12-2020T01:21:09,CrRAR,No one’da guess
03-12-2020T01:21:12,Dadrobit,It's unreasonably good to be honest.
03-12-2020T01:21:24,CrRAR,I could see that
03-12-2020T01:21:50,Dadrobit,"It was a big, ""you're kidding me!"" moment when he first told me how he made his stuffing lol."
03-12-2020T01:22:57,Dadrobit,"And yeah, I pass that one for every day on the way to work. Right off the main loop highway for central AZ. Constant traffic."
03-12-2020T01:23:09,Dadrobit,That one dot*
03-12-2020T01:23:31,CrRAR,Wow
03-12-2020T01:24:13,CrRAR,Honestly I’d imagine a lot of transplants from the midwest proabably flock there.
03-12-2020T01:24:41,CrRAR,Seeing the chain’s like nostalgia
03-12-2020T01:24:55,Dadrobit,It was almost parody level absurdness how it was all over the news that White Castle was coming here.
03-12-2020T01:25:34,CrRAR,With that level of attention they need more stores
03-12-2020T01:26:16,Dadrobit,"And yeah, snowbirds love travelling here. Noticibly less this year thankfully. Seems they're taking lockdown more seriously."
03-12-2020T01:26:35,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s no in n out or jack in the box here
03-12-2020T01:26:44,SpazztasticKiwi,or white castle
03-12-2020T01:26:47,SpazztasticKiwi,or chipotle
03-12-2020T01:27:03,CrRAR,;_;
03-12-2020T01:27:06,Dadrobit,There's a distinct possibility of more opening. But I'm not 100% sure they would.
03-12-2020T01:27:16,Dadrobit,I love me some Chipotle!
03-12-2020T01:27:37,Dadrobit,Fast food Mexican baby!
03-12-2020T01:27:48,SpazztasticKiwi,arbys and wendys only exist in the cities
03-12-2020T01:28:24,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s ~45 minutes to burger king
03-12-2020T01:28:31,SpazztasticKiwi,or a hardees
03-12-2020T01:28:47,Dadrobit,S'pose that's a benefit to living in a megalopolis. We have pretty much everything somewhere accessible within 30 minutes.
03-12-2020T01:30:51,SpazztasticKiwi,kitty back in bag
03-12-2020T01:31:08,SpazztasticKiwi,does he think it’s a doorway
03-12-2020T01:31:13,CrRAR,Yup
03-12-2020T01:31:45,Dadrobit,Taco bags are the doorway to flavor-town
03-12-2020T01:31:53,CrRAR,He like “I KNOW she pulled food outta somehere in here”
03-12-2020T01:32:27,CrRAR,*looks at you*
03-12-2020T01:32:40,CrRAR,“C-can you do it again?”
03-12-2020T01:32:48,CrRAR,“I’ll wait”
03-12-2020T01:32:55,CrRAR,*sits on leg*
03-12-2020T01:33:32,CrRAR,Yeah ya can never uderestimate local cains or small places
03-12-2020T01:33:38,CrRAR,*chains
03-12-2020T01:34:55,Dadrobit,"Mmmm, there's a tiny hole in the wall Thai place only 5 minutes from my home. Unbelievable good food."
03-12-2020T01:35:09,Dadrobit,Probably mentioned them here before actually.
03-12-2020T01:36:08,Dadrobit,Dining room for the restaurant isn't much bigger than the dinning room in my house (not big).
03-12-2020T01:36:09,CrRAR,"Ha, yeah there’s places like that but here the 3 specialty places I know are like 30mins away"
03-12-2020T01:36:34,CrRAR,Yeah that’s like the Korean place I think we talked about that
03-12-2020T01:36:53,CrRAR,Trueest definitionof dining “parlor”
03-12-2020T01:37:07,CrRAR,Excellent food
03-12-2020T01:37:24,Dadrobit,"I just ate, I shouldn't be this hungry."
03-12-2020T01:37:51,Dadrobit,"The MSG, it calls to me."
03-12-2020T01:39:37,SpazztasticKiwi,food just calls to me
03-12-2020T01:40:15,SpazztasticKiwi,like for 3 days I was trying to catch the hibachi place & then finally got it
03-12-2020T01:40:31,SpazztasticKiwi,ready to marry a guy that can cook rice like that
03-12-2020T01:40:56,SpazztasticKiwi,then Seán plays raft & eats taco bell midway so of course today that’s what I had to get
03-12-2020T01:41:18,Dadrobit,I feel like a take-out hibachi grill kinda misses the point.
03-12-2020T01:41:19,CrRAR,haha
03-12-2020T01:41:59,SpazztasticKiwi,the dude can cook some shrimp
03-12-2020T01:42:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"dude can cook, period"
03-12-2020T01:42:52,Dadrobit,Just a dude juggling eggs and making onion valcanos for nobody and then stuffing it all into a styrofoam box and handing it to a person in their car.
03-12-2020T01:43:17,CrRAR,Yeah all this talk I’m already weighing what make my next order out
03-12-2020T01:43:19,SpazztasticKiwi,a good tinder profile be like “I cook & love cats & you can sleep on me”
03-12-2020T01:43:23,SpazztasticKiwi,sold

03-12-2020T01:43:50,CrRAR,dats all ya need
03-12-2020T01:44:56,SpazztasticKiwi,facebook had a guy share that his girlfriend got jealous his cat got more attention so he had to pick one
03-12-2020T01:44:58,Dadrobit,I am 100% ordering take out from the Thai Kitchen tomorrow.
03-12-2020T01:45:08,SpazztasticKiwi,so he’s telling this story while holding his cat...
03-12-2020T01:45:16,SpazztasticKiwi,ILL TAKE HIM
03-12-2020T01:45:44,SpazztasticKiwi,*sharing
03-12-2020T01:45:55,CrRAR,"Yeah, tbh robit, there are totally some places that aren’t worth ordering out from, so I know what you’re saying"
03-12-2020T01:46:26,Dadrobit,"You're paying extra for ""The Presentation"""
03-12-2020T01:46:39,Dadrobit,But there's no presentation nowadays.
03-12-2020T01:46:40,CrRAR,Yeah
03-12-2020T01:47:19,SpazztasticKiwi,all I know is I want to try kimbab
03-12-2020T01:47:38,Dadrobit,"Like, Firebirds has second to none the absolute best steaks ever, and I will happily pay $40 every time I sit down in there. Definitely not ordering out from them though...."
03-12-2020T01:48:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Mike Chen had it in Korea and apparently it tastes like it’s from heavens table so
03-12-2020T01:48:11,CrRAR,I was just looking at the Korean place near my old work’s menu
03-12-2020T01:48:22,CrRAR,This talk is getting too srs xD
03-12-2020T01:49:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d really like to go for sdcc because the food variety’s got to be lit
03-12-2020T01:50:03,Dadrobit,Greater San Diego? Absolutely. Inside the con? Expect chili dogs and nachos for $20.
03-12-2020T01:50:38,CrRAR,Is it a dude in a Sonic suit selling em?
03-12-2020T01:50:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m talking dinner in town maybe every night and a pass by whatever’s close for breakfast
03-12-2020T01:51:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I might carry a small snac stash but lunch will be nonexistent so I can get my din din on
03-12-2020T01:51:32,CrRAR,yass :pancakes:
03-12-2020T01:51:43,Dadrobit,"Selling them? No, but sonic cheshire will definitely be around with a hundred different Deadpools."

03-12-2020T01:52:58,Dadrobit,It actually won't let me type fursuits without erasing the word twice....
03-12-2020T01:53:12,CrRAR,wow
03-12-2020T01:53:20,SpazztasticKiwi,sdcc is a comic con tho

03-12-2020T01:53:27,CrRAR,Yeah autocorrect has gotten too aggressive
03-12-2020T01:53:33,Dadrobit,My phone is trying to protect me.
03-12-2020T01:53:35,SpazztasticKiwi,not that will stop em
03-12-2020T01:53:51,CrRAR,Nope
03-12-2020T01:54:01,SpazztasticKiwi,there were suits at PAX and it’s a game con
03-12-2020T01:54:01,Dadrobit,"And PhxCC isn't a furcon either. Still, fursuits everywhere."
03-12-2020T01:54:21,SpazztasticKiwi,ever tried sdcc?
03-12-2020T01:54:45,Dadrobit,I was actually thinking about it this year. Then this year happened.
03-12-2020T01:54:48,SpazztasticKiwi,you know pheonix is closer actually
03-12-2020T01:54:58,SpazztasticKiwi,(to me)
03-12-2020T01:55:14,SpazztasticKiwi,buuuuut Toms more likely to be at san d
03-12-2020T01:55:30,SpazztasticKiwi,....decisions decisions
03-12-2020T01:55:41,Dadrobit,Phoenix CC kinda lost lot of it's followship after that one terror attack attempt.
03-12-2020T01:56:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"wasn’t that the story for a majority of us, I know I’m not the only one that ended up reversing plane and hotel charges"
03-12-2020T01:57:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I never even got my tickets just in case but they rolled them over for next year
03-12-2020T01:57:23,Dadrobit,Then SDCC tried to kill all the other cons with lawsuits so they had to change their name to avoid problems and it lost even more followship.
03-12-2020T01:57:38,CrRAR,Wow
03-12-2020T01:57:45,CrRAR,Con warfare?
03-12-2020T01:58:08,SpazztasticKiwi,what’s the harm in letting a bit of the crowds go somewhere else every now and then
03-12-2020T01:58:19,Dadrobit,And THEN someone hurt the con aagain by starting a fire alarm and shutting everything down for a day....
03-12-2020T01:58:30,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s no way they only barely make profit with the popularity its got
03-12-2020T01:59:15,Dadrobit,PHXCC used to be ginormous. It was number 2 or 3 behind SDCC and it feels way smaller now...
03-12-2020T01:59:34,SpazztasticKiwi,ah so maybe that was why sdcc went after it
03-12-2020T01:59:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I must be number one *eye twitches*
03-12-2020T02:00:41,SpazztasticKiwi,everybody says 2016 is a war flashbacks year
03-12-2020T02:00:47,Dadrobit,"No actually, they went after a much smaller con and won. PHXCC saw that and pre-emptivly changed to PHX Fan Fusion to completely avoid the issue."
03-12-2020T02:01:01,CrRAR,Haha
03-12-2020T02:01:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"after all this, nobody better meant 2020 in any capacity to me"
03-12-2020T02:01:12,CrRAR,wow
03-12-2020T02:01:29,CrRAR,“We own the concecutive CC’s thing”
03-12-2020T02:01:39,CrRAR,“That’s OUR thing”
03-12-2020T02:01:53,Dadrobit,It's super fucking annoying that they did that ngl
03-12-2020T02:02:08,CrRAR,“WE are the Comiccon commanders”
03-12-2020T02:02:34,Dadrobit,"I think changing the name really did hurt more than the ""no prop weapons allowed"" debacle."
03-12-2020T02:02:42,SpazztasticKiwi,they changed the names and fused some of the game cons I know through Seán and the others too
03-12-2020T02:06:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to do things
03-12-2020T02:06:08,SpazztasticKiwi,and sorta around people
03-12-2020T02:06:14,SpazztasticKiwi,but only Some people
03-12-2020T02:06:22,SpazztasticKiwi,and only a little
03-12-2020T02:06:29,SpazztasticKiwi,you feel me?
03-12-2020T02:07:02,Dadrobit,I really do miss going to cons.
03-12-2020T02:07:56,Dadrobit,"PHXCC, Game On Expo, Zap Con... Fuckin loved spending a day or three just having fun and spending unreadable amounts of money on shit."
03-12-2020T02:08:07,Dadrobit,Unreasonable*
03-12-2020T02:08:25,SpazztasticKiwi,“I can’t read”
03-12-2020T02:09:19,Dadrobit,It's like Vegas. Just withdraw $500 and consider it already lost and don't pull out a penny more.
03-12-2020T02:10:30,SpazztasticKiwi,the only thing I came close to getting at PAX was a 3d metal puzzle sculpture but didn’t
03-12-2020T02:11:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d like to have it now & maybe gotten another one or two
03-12-2020T02:11:21,SpazztasticKiwi,but I got good stuff out of it
03-12-2020T02:12:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Seán is bigger than I thought he’d be & him & Ethan both are average but that’s much taller than I was thinking
03-12-2020T02:12:28,SpazztasticKiwi,which makes them taller than me but that’s not hard
03-12-2020T02:15:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I found a ridiculously unnecessary cat bed hammock contraption on amazon
03-12-2020T02:17:09,CrRAR,I saw a reddit video of these folks that had built like a cat elevator in their house
03-12-2020T02:17:48,CrRAR,"It was just a counter weighted rope and pully thing with a bag on the end, it let the cat get down from the rafters"

03-12-2020T14:27:38,iliar,There are many videos of Korean street food on YouTube. This food looks pretty tasty.
03-12-2020T14:27:43,iliar,I'm curious. But how close to reality these videos.
03-12-2020T14:35:36,Twokinds,"Korean street food is very good, in my opinion. It's a pretty common thing."
03-12-2020T14:37:40,Twokinds,"I don't know how close they are to the videos you've seen. But yeah, the food is always one of the most memerable parts of the trip each time I'm there."
03-12-2020T14:38:09,Twokinds,It's a big part of the culture.
03-12-2020T14:47:49,Folfy,I don't think I've ever been to a Korean Restaurant. Might try to find one in my area.
03-12-2020T14:59:51,Twokinds,"I may be bias, but Korean bbq is great."

03-12-2020T15:38:31,Roughlandin,Agreed! It contrasts Nat's fur and the background really well

03-12-2020T16:01:14,Roughlandin,Korean food in general is delicious
03-12-2020T16:01:40,SpazztasticKiwi,thing is I’ve only seen and heard but yet to try because of the area
03-12-2020T16:03:03,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s more Japan & Chinaesqe places that take over if they manage to set good roots
03-12-2020T16:03:21,Roughlandin,Chicken Bibimbap is my jam. We've got one really good Korean place near me and an Asian fusion restaurant that does good Korean and has amazing ramen and sushi
03-12-2020T16:03:32,Roughlandin,We also have a great Thai place
03-12-2020T16:03:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve seen that word spelled so many different ways

03-12-2020T21:33:50,SageSaga,didnt take but a couple minutes of us getting there before someone accidentally put a portable hole in a bag of holding and got sucked into the astral plane
03-12-2020T21:34:06,Blackironwolf,Lol
03-12-2020T21:34:28,NezumiYuki,Well dang Sage...
03-12-2020T21:34:33,Roughlandin,"...I don't think we're in Kansas anymore, Toto"

03-12-2020T21:35:23,SageSaga,dont even remember who did it - but we decided not to immediately save them because they wouldnt learn anything if we did
03-12-2020T21:35:36,CrRAR,haha
03-12-2020T21:35:39,NezumiYuki,LOL smart move  xDD
03-12-2020T21:36:18,Roughlandin,Reminds me of the end of Critical Role's first campaign where Grog pulled a card from the Deck of Many things and lost his soul
03-12-2020T21:36:27,CrRAR,:c
03-12-2020T21:36:37,SpazztasticKiwi,extreme “you made this mess now clean it up”
03-12-2020T21:36:39,Blackironwolf,Woops

03-12-2020T21:37:08,CrRAR,cool
03-12-2020T21:37:46,Roughlandin,"It honestly wasn't the worst card he could have pulled. In fact, that was really the only bad pull he got"
03-12-2020T21:38:04,Roughlandin,"If I remember right, some of those cards can straight up end a campaign"
03-12-2020T21:39:14,SageSaga,"*Pulls from Deck of many things* ""You must fight an avatar of death itself!"" *the shadowy form of death takes shape- a terrifying skull like mask peaks from under his death shroud* ""I cast blade of devastation"" ""The avatar of death begins to weep"""

03-12-2020T21:47:45,Grip,"Kate and Blue are best girls to me, love Kate's tiger tail."

03-12-2020T21:47:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m ready to go screaming into the night listening to this
03-12-2020T21:48:11,ZRO4825,Toyoko ftw. \[T]/
03-12-2020T21:48:16,Roughlandin,I'm reminded of an Always Sunny episode
03-12-2020T21:48:16,TheSexyBeast,A hammer fixes it
03-12-2020T21:48:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,\[T]/
03-12-2020T21:48:32,Roughlandin,...That new animation is nice btw
03-12-2020T21:48:35,Roughlandin,woof
03-12-2020T21:50:41,SageSaga,i think Maty is hoping for CGPhil to become peoples favorite so theres more art of her
03-12-2020T21:53:35,ZRO4825,lol
03-12-2020T21:53:39,Grip,"She is a cutie, should get a picture of her being pet and swishing her tail."
03-12-2020T21:53:53,RedDragonSyndicate,Hey Grip XD
03-12-2020T21:53:58,Grip,Hi Red ^^
03-12-2020T21:54:08,RedDragonSyndicate,Didn't know you stalked these parts
03-12-2020T21:54:16,Grip,lol.
03-12-2020T21:54:27,ZRO4825,Grip is everywhere.
03-12-2020T21:54:44,Grip,I also am imagining Blue would fake being affected by catnip to be silly with Nami or Kate.
03-12-2020T21:57:16,Grip,"Sorry, random thoughts and ideas XD"
03-12-2020T21:58:00,SageSaga,still no ord
03-12-2020T21:58:12,Grip,ord?

03-12-2020T21:58:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Wonder if he got snowed out of his house?
03-12-2020T21:58:28,SageSaga,Ordithus
03-12-2020T21:58:33,ZRO4825,I need more Toyoko.
03-12-2020T21:58:36,Roughlandin,(Don't tell Teddy)
03-12-2020T21:58:44,Grip,Ah right. Might be snowing here soon.
03-12-2020T21:59:48,Roughlandin,"Don't let your mods stay out in the snow. Remember: If you're cold, they're cold."
03-12-2020T22:00:28,Grip,Need to have Blue and Kate wrap tails around them to keep them warm.
03-12-2020T22:01:15,Roughlandin,I have a feeling Ord would enjoy that. (Don't tell him I said that)
03-12-2020T22:02:18,Twokinds,"Sorry, I have no energy to stream tonight"
03-12-2020T22:02:25,Roughlandin,No worries Tom!

03-12-2020T22:02:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Oki doke, have the good sleepies"
03-12-2020T22:02:39,SageSaga,rest up for energy for D&D tomorrow

03-12-2020T22:03:38,MisterWho,"Ouch, then of to bed with you!"
03-12-2020T22:03:40,Twokinds,I'm worried about D&D tomorrow. We'll see.
03-12-2020T22:03:42,SageSaga,"lol i was thinking about asking you to start your stream with the text ""watch Sage for tonight - picarto.tv/Sagesaga"""
03-12-2020T22:03:45,Zakuru,"Rest up Tom, hope you feel better"

03-12-2020T22:04:38,MisterWho,No repairs for te holo deck then today. ;)
03-12-2020T22:04:53,ZapiliDver,Health is main thing!
03-12-2020T22:04:58,NezumiYuki,^ THIS
03-12-2020T22:05:04,Roughlandin,It was color week. And you streamed for a long time yesterday
03-12-2020T22:05:07,MisterWho,"Health first, chaos later"
03-12-2020T22:05:20,NezumiYuki,There's always time for chaos later
03-12-2020T22:05:42,MisterWho,There ws a stream yesterday? O.o
03-12-2020T22:05:51,NezumiYuki,Wait.. there was?

03-12-2020T22:06:33,NezumiYuki,well I guess it's a good idea to check back tomorrow too.  Tom might stream then.
03-12-2020T22:06:39,MisterWho,Ar..picarto
03-12-2020T22:07:02,NezumiYuki,Oh the many forms of Nora

03-12-2020T22:08:08,Roughlandin,Whew! I was sleepy a bit ago but I just had a double dose of matcha!
03-12-2020T22:08:13,NezumiYuki,"I should take this advice to heart too and take a short nap, that way I can at least come back for more Sagesaga"
03-12-2020T22:08:22,ZapiliDver,Better than coffee
03-12-2020T22:08:26,CrRAR,:zap::ctwokinds-kingtea::zap:
03-12-2020T22:08:32,SageSaga,rest well Nezumi
03-12-2020T22:08:39,Roughlandin,Have a nice nappy Yuki!
03-12-2020T22:08:48,NezumiYuki,Just dont give too much coffee to Maddy!  xDDD
03-12-2020T22:09:05,Roughlandin,"But yeah, must be better than coffee. I'm used to caffeine and this stuff is giving me a headrush"
03-12-2020T22:09:30,CrRAR,:ccrrar-yis:
03-12-2020T22:09:48,Roughlandin,...I just realized I drank that whole mug with the bags still in it. Like and animal. :bear:
03-12-2020T22:09:54,MisterWho,"Messages are on, i get a lot messages from other picarto streams...but no twokinds mail. Something is wrong there."
03-12-2020T22:10:12,Roughlandin,Have you tried turning it off and on again?
03-12-2020T22:10:15,NezumiYuki,"caffeine boost is good and all, but the following crash just takes away any advantage the bean juice gave you ..... so I usually avoid bean juice or tea when I can."
03-12-2020T22:10:35,CrRAR,Yeah if you click the heart again while still faved it has the notices switch
03-12-2020T22:10:35,NezumiYuki,"right then, short nap and return for more Sage"
03-12-2020T22:10:40,NezumiYuki,See ya guys in a jiffy
03-12-2020T22:10:41,ZapiliDver,last year i've made a mistake and put 3 tea spoon of matcha powder in a cup... no sleep at all
03-12-2020T22:10:43,CrRAR,ok Nezumi
03-12-2020T22:10:45,CrRAR,:v:
03-12-2020T22:10:48,Roughlandin,"Like I said, I'm so addicted it usually doesn't affect me"
03-12-2020T22:10:52,NezumiYuki,Rock on Sage!
03-12-2020T22:10:58,Roughlandin,But this stuff has me wired
03-12-2020T22:11:01,Roughlandin,o/ Yuki
03-12-2020T22:11:27,CrRAR,Is it like caffeinated matcha? Is that just concentrated green tea?
03-12-2020T22:11:33,ZapiliDver,Yeah
03-12-2020T22:11:48,ZapiliDver,This powder take place in Japaneesee tea ceremony
03-12-2020T22:12:00,ZapiliDver,And it's really stonger than any coffee
03-12-2020T22:12:05,CrRAR,ah wow
03-12-2020T22:12:12,Roughlandin,Should have looked at the box closer. My brother has good taste in tea
03-12-2020T22:12:36,CrRAR,ahhh
03-12-2020T22:12:46,Roughlandin,Should have put a warning label on this stuff before he went back to Cali
03-12-2020T22:12:57,CrRAR,The growing process they undergo encourages MORE caffeine production
03-12-2020T22:13:01,CrRAR,iiinterestinggg
03-12-2020T22:13:06,ZapiliDver,Only one thing is better (but not for health) - coffee + cola
03-12-2020T22:13:07,Roughlandin,Well that explains a lot
03-12-2020T22:13:38,CrRAR,yeah it says that they are grown using more shade somehow and that makes more caffeine
03-12-2020T22:14:03,Roughlandin,I've tried cola nut before. Didn't like it. Almost felt like a nicotine rush
03-12-2020T22:14:12,CrRAR,interesting that low light conditions lead to more of a substance that keeps animals wired
03-12-2020T22:14:25,CrRAR,that's like video games logic

03-12-2020T23:38:43,Roughlandin,I've been through several cycles of that
03-12-2020T23:38:58,Roughlandin,Finally looped back around to a semi-normal schedule

03-12-2020T23:49:03,Nekonny,placing this leg is the bane of my existance on this model
03-12-2020T23:50:06,NezumiYuki,"Miss Twin Tails is shaping up nicely, Sage. :D"

03-12-2020T23:54:21,RedDragonSyndicate,Tom's lines and colors have always popped
03-12-2020T23:54:35,RedDragonSyndicate,X| how is he so frigg'n good at that. I never evolved past scribbles

03-12-2020T23:55:25,Roughlandin,"Lol he's only been practicing for 17 years, Red"
03-12-2020T23:55:56,NezumiYuki,"I need to do much the same, Nekonny...  Watch some run-throughs and tuts on youtube regarding rigging in Blender."
03-12-2020T23:56:04,SageSaga,Red knows Rough- he was one of the originals
