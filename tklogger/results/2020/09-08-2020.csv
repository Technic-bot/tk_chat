09-08-2020T21:04:02,CrRAR,aaaand?
09-08-2020T21:04:06,Twokinds,But all the numbers I'm getting say we actually already passed 1000.

09-08-2020T21:05:20,CrRAR,is it WORTHY?
09-08-2020T21:05:23,Twokinds,I don't know
09-08-2020T21:05:32,Twokinds,"Like, my count was 1013 - 1016"
09-08-2020T21:05:32,CrRAR,oh haha
09-08-2020T21:05:52,Twokinds,"But that could be off by a couple if I missed one, or accidentally counted an alternate duplicate."
09-08-2020T21:06:09,RimaDraws,that's alot of sketches
09-08-2020T21:06:10,CrRAR,"true, it's an imperfect science"
09-08-2020T21:06:49,RimaDraws,i don't have that patience lol
09-08-2020T21:06:50,Twokinds,I have no clue why patreon still says 992 if that's not the true number
09-08-2020T21:07:04,Twokinds,"It seems to be stuck, since it said 992 yesterday."
09-08-2020T21:07:18,CrRAR,hrmmm
09-08-2020T21:07:23,Twokinds,But I can't keep counting.
09-08-2020T21:07:33,Twokinds,"We hit it, or will hit sometime around now."
09-08-2020T21:08:19,CrRAR,Everyone can choose their own personal '1000'
09-08-2020T21:08:27,CrRAR,Whatever means the most to em
09-08-2020T21:08:37,RimaDraws,still congrats tom
09-08-2020T21:08:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"technically depending on how you count them as a whole, any one of them could be 1000"

09-08-2020T21:14:28,Twokinds,"Since we hit 1000, I might try a contest where I ask people their favorite sketches."
09-08-2020T21:14:43,Twokinds,I would be interested to see which ones people liked the most.
09-08-2020T21:15:35,Dadrobit,As an unbiased third party observer. I'd probably choose Nibbly as Michael Jackson with the backup Basitins
09-08-2020T21:15:57,Dadrobit,Just my totally unbiased opinion though.
09-08-2020T21:16:08,BadFoMo,What's the prize?
09-08-2020T21:16:17,Twokinds,heheh maybe more sketches
09-08-2020T21:16:34,Twokinds,"Yeah, that was a good one."
09-08-2020T21:16:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Flora electrocuting Trace was good
09-08-2020T21:16:54,SpazztasticKiwi,the evil
09-08-2020T21:17:05,Twokinds,mmmhm
09-08-2020T21:17:11,SpazztasticKiwi,anything Nibbly would work
09-08-2020T21:17:37,CrRAR,:trophy::ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
09-08-2020T21:17:47,SpazztasticKiwi,all hail Nibbly
09-08-2020T21:18:08,SpazztasticKiwi,we’ve got Nibbly the pharaoh
09-08-2020T21:18:16,SpazztasticKiwi,why not Nibbly Sphinx
09-08-2020T21:18:39,BadFoMo,I'd have to look at them all again. That is /if/ this is not Patreons only.
09-08-2020T21:19:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Maeve with the penguins is a top tier
09-08-2020T21:19:25,Twokinds,"Patreon does not allow for games of chance, so I can't do a random lottery. Therefore, it would have to be not Patreon only."
09-08-2020T21:19:54,Twokinds,"I would have it somewhere else, and anyone can participate by naming their faveorite sketch(es)"
09-08-2020T21:19:58,SpazztasticKiwi,anything Mauve would work
09-08-2020T21:20:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"and how, pray tell, would you organize that"
09-08-2020T21:20:53,Dadrobit,Bring amenon out of the basement?
09-08-2020T21:20:56,Twokinds,I'm not sure.
09-08-2020T21:21:01,CrRAR,Garden Bugcatcher Maeve~
09-08-2020T21:21:20,BadFoMo,"Ok, I might be in. I'll have to get back to you on my choice."
09-08-2020T21:21:21,Twokinds,"It's hard, there's not a good place to do it."
09-08-2020T21:21:24,CrRAR,uhh I feel like the first round everyone would have to submit a nomination or something
09-08-2020T21:21:28,SpazztasticKiwi,bug catcher Maeve?
09-08-2020T21:21:32,CrRAR,THEN the VOTES
09-08-2020T21:21:37,Twokinds,"the forums aren't very active anymore, and DA isn't very active anymore."
09-08-2020T21:21:40,Twokinds,"Twitter, maybe."
09-08-2020T21:21:55,BadFoMo,I'm out again.
09-08-2020T21:22:02,SpazztasticKiwi,da has been a pest sometimes
09-08-2020T21:22:03,Twokinds,lol
09-08-2020T21:22:19,Twokinds,I dunno
09-08-2020T21:22:42,Dadrobit,Maybe cut out some of the middleman of the process by only using the ones that got color votes? They're essentially already nominated over everything else.
09-08-2020T21:22:45,SpazztasticKiwi,twitter works but if people were to suggest through replies...that’d be a job to sort
09-08-2020T21:23:00,Twokinds,Well...
09-08-2020T21:23:22,CrRAR,This one spazz:
09-08-2020T21:23:22,BadFoMo,Oh! What if wee all eMailed you our choices?!

09-08-2020T21:23:37,Twokinds,I was kinda thinking I'd color the sketch
09-08-2020T21:23:44,Dadrobit,"Oh, lol."
09-08-2020T21:24:03,Dadrobit,"Well, that eliminiates the colored choices lol."
09-08-2020T21:24:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"Jesus, RIP Toms email"
09-08-2020T21:24:16,CrRAR,^
09-08-2020T21:24:17,Twokinds,"Well, no, I'd just pick one that didn't have color already."
09-08-2020T21:24:45,Dimensional,k
09-08-2020T21:25:11,BadFoMo,@SpazztasticKiwi /me laughs evily.
09-08-2020T21:25:14,SpazztasticKiwi,you think you’d restrict the sketches to this year or anything?
09-08-2020T21:25:23,Twokinds,No any year
09-08-2020T21:25:31,SpazztasticKiwi,good luck
09-08-2020T21:26:17,RimaDraws,oh fun
09-08-2020T21:26:21,RimaDraws,that will take forever
09-08-2020T21:27:18,SpazztasticKiwi,does discord have a poll or raffle thingy at all
09-08-2020T21:27:34,RimaDraws,well now that i got the set up of my presentation. i can do the information tomorrow and record it then. for now i want to laminate my twokinds art and put it in my portfolio
09-08-2020T21:27:56,Twokinds,I don't think so
09-08-2020T21:28:13,Dadrobit,"Mmmmm, I'd think it'd be best to do several smaller voting sessions like a tournament bracket. If you give folks a sheet with hundreds of options, people are gonna get fatigued and just vote for the stuff towards the top."
09-08-2020T21:29:07,CrRAR,showdown
09-08-2020T21:29:14,CrRAR,of ultimate artistry
09-08-2020T21:29:44,RimaDraws,yea i get tired of fanservice always winning
09-08-2020T21:30:54,Dadrobit,"S'why even real life ballots have to be in alphabetical order instead of by party. Even with just a few options and for very serious things, people don't like spending very long choosing what to vote for."
09-08-2020T21:31:21,Twokinds,I didn't have a tournament in mind
09-08-2020T21:31:27,RimaDraws,i like looking at options but nine out of ten i will vote more wholesome than anything
09-08-2020T21:31:55,Twokinds,"Just, name your favorite sketch, and your in the raffle."
09-08-2020T21:32:07,RimaDraws,uh
09-08-2020T21:32:18,RimaDraws,i have so many favs
09-08-2020T21:32:25,RimaDraws,i got a few i want colored
09-08-2020T21:32:56,CrRAR,whoop
09-08-2020T21:32:59,SpazztasticKiwi,have you tried survey maker
09-08-2020T21:33:03,Twokinds,"Well, it'd be fine to name more than one if you want. XD Though if I did do this, I think only one would get the color treatment."
09-08-2020T21:33:32,Twokinds,"So if your name was drawn, you'd have to pick."
09-08-2020T21:33:33,RimaDraws,i dont mind
09-08-2020T21:34:07,Dadrobit,"Oh, so it's just a username raffle?"
09-08-2020T21:34:19,SpazztasticKiwi,so gather names over the course of a week and then put those in a random selector & whoever wins picks a sketch?
09-08-2020T21:35:02,CrRAR,:ccrrar-thumbs:
09-08-2020T21:35:04,Twokinds,"Yeah, I dunno, something casual."
09-08-2020T21:35:10,Twokinds,I'm not sure.
09-08-2020T21:35:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I can hear it now
09-08-2020T21:35:45,SpazztasticKiwi,“there was a raffle?”
09-08-2020T21:35:59,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-keifacepalm:
09-08-2020T21:36:07,Dadrobit,"It'll be like that regardless, Spazz."
09-08-2020T21:36:16,SpazztasticKiwi,won’t matter if it’s open for a month
09-08-2020T21:36:17,Dadrobit,Tom could have it up for a month and folks would miss it
09-08-2020T21:36:21,SpazztasticKiwi,ay

09-08-2020T21:37:48,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s something that should exist but most likely doesn’t
09-08-2020T21:38:19,SpazztasticKiwi,baby Nibbly was never colored
09-08-2020T21:38:20,Dadrobit,"Ohhhh, forgot about that one, Rima."
09-08-2020T21:38:28,CrRAR,Connect the Spots was cute
09-08-2020T21:38:31,RimaDraws,i really wanted that one colored and the father's day one
09-08-2020T21:38:33,SpazztasticKiwi,pretty sure it’s my only one that hasn’t so far

09-08-2020T21:41:14,CrimsonHelsing,Just for the heck of it
09-08-2020T21:41:14,SpazztasticKiwi,99% everyone voting for their own sketch
09-08-2020T21:41:16,Twokinds,Could use marbles

09-08-2020T21:47:34,RimaDraws,too strong
09-08-2020T21:48:01,Dadrobit,"""Timber"" though...."
09-08-2020T21:48:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I got to hate old spice because it all smells the same & there’s always too much

09-08-2020T21:48:32,RimaDraws,its always too much
