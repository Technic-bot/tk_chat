30-10-2020T00:08:03,CrRAR,A worthy nemesis for younger Euchre no doubt

30-10-2020T00:10:28,Dadrobit,"Oh, she sass"
30-10-2020T00:10:29,MuonNeutrino,"3yo rose would be asking you to come outside and play with her *constantly*, and the only possible answer is 'yes'"
30-10-2020T00:10:30,KeefMcDerpface,"lol, Ord"
30-10-2020T00:10:42,NezumiYuki,Agreed Muon

30-10-2020T00:12:24,BadFoMo,Ah. I've never played that game.
30-10-2020T00:12:26,NezumiYuki,There is still one thing I admire about Tom..  His prefection of the wild feline face structure!    That tiggy snoot is bloody perfect!   Not too long and not too short.
30-10-2020T00:12:46,Ordithus,:eyes: ooh
30-10-2020T00:12:55,NezumiYuki,Wolves and doggos in general are easy... Most if not all have long snoots
30-10-2020T00:13:08,NezumiYuki,Tigers and some other large cats however.
30-10-2020T00:13:15,NezumiYuki,There's some snoot but not too much
30-10-2020T00:13:19,Dadrobit,"It's the way the head sits kind of in front of the neck I think. (Not criticism, I like the design, just a fun similarity)"
30-10-2020T00:13:21,NezumiYuki,it's a fine balance
30-10-2020T00:13:43,Sclimshady,My wife <3

30-10-2020T00:16:03,Twokinds,Lions are weird to draw
30-10-2020T00:16:13,Twokinds,They have a very distinctive profile

30-10-2020T00:24:53,NezumiYuki,"Not at all sure, Dadro"
30-10-2020T00:24:58,Twokinds,The previous one?
30-10-2020T00:25:01,NezumiYuki,it's just Kurzgesagt

30-10-2020T00:26:23,Dadrobit,"Gave me an idea for a suggestion, ""Tom draws the darkest most devious thing he can think of while listening to ""Is The EU Bad?"" on repeat""."
30-10-2020T00:26:26,NezumiYuki,Is the E.U. bad?   I dun know... Ask Britain!

30-10-2020T00:27:22,BadFoMo,Hmm?
30-10-2020T00:27:38,Ordithus,"I cannot read that, no"
30-10-2020T00:27:42,ZRO4825,"idk. Give me long enough and I could translate'em, but I'm admittedly slacking on my Japanese lessons, lol."
30-10-2020T00:28:25,BadFoMo,I'd just run it through Google Traslate.

30-10-2020T00:29:45,BadFoMo,"Uh, copy the title of the MP3/WAV and paste into Google Translate?"
30-10-2020T00:30:10,ZRO4825,How're you gonna copy it off Sage's stream though? :P
30-10-2020T00:30:35,BadFoMo,That's for /before/ it goes onto the stream.
30-10-2020T00:31:50,SageSaga,man that hoboburger i had tonight was really good...
30-10-2020T00:31:57,AspiringNoodle,hoboburger?
30-10-2020T00:32:38,Dadrobit,"Maybe it's like hobo stew, but burgers."
30-10-2020T00:32:53,BadFoMo,Hobo Stew?
30-10-2020T00:33:16,BadFoMo,...Made from Hobos?
30-10-2020T00:33:28,SageSaga,its where ya wrap hamburger up with potatoes and salt and pepper and if ya want stuff like onions and such- in foil and bake it
30-10-2020T00:33:38,Dadrobit,"Meat chunks, potatoes, and carrots cooked in an empty ravioli can in a fire."
30-10-2020T00:33:47,unsteddyphoenix,"Hey hey people, me here"

30-10-2020T00:43:52,SageSaga,maybe i will just throw away a ton of these comic books i have on my shelf
30-10-2020T00:45:25,SageSaga,i get to draw  naked Nyna-

30-10-2020T00:47:53,Dadrobit,"Oh, speaking of script and sex! Have you figured out if/how you're going to approach the Aether's Revival series?"
30-10-2020T00:48:00,MoonDance,Nude is style- called fashion!
30-10-2020T00:48:32,SageSaga,not sure about that yet- might just have to draw sex for it
30-10-2020T00:49:08,MoonDance,Any hand holding?
30-10-2020T00:49:08,SageSaga,its a lot of money- its not my characters- *shrug*

30-10-2020T00:51:25,SageSaga,also remember that at least the scene scenes from his book are pretty tasteful- its not the hentai madness that was the tentacle book and the Power Fantasy book
30-10-2020T00:51:44,SageSaga,the sex scenes XD not the scene scenes
30-10-2020T00:52:07,NezumiYuki,the obscene scenes?  >:3

30-10-2020T00:54:30,Dadrobit,"I mean, it's grounded in reality at least yeah.... Besides the parts that aren't...."
30-10-2020T00:55:27,SageSaga,"the sex is pretty normal - not the ""She shuddered under my touch and her eyes turned into hearts as she blathered incoherently -"""
30-10-2020T00:55:45,unsteddyphoenix,Wait thats not normal?
30-10-2020T00:56:27,SageSaga,if your lovers pupils turn into hearts you may be in a hentai

30-10-2020T01:00:54,Dadrobit,"But yeah, any issue I have is just kinda an extension of my general issue with the series. It would have helped in places to have a proper editor. It read very clearly as a self published book in places."

30-10-2020T01:13:38,FenceEqualizer,👁
30-10-2020T01:14:01,unsteddyphoenix,Was the Rose age chart started ages ago? Why do I feel like I remember it.
30-10-2020T01:14:08,Sesarag,Bai
30-10-2020T01:14:12,Sclimshady,"Back off Teddy,  shes mine"
30-10-2020T01:14:12,Ordithus,it was a sketch from quite some time ago
30-10-2020T01:14:21,FenceEqualizer,I don’t think it was colored before
30-10-2020T01:14:27,InTheLionsDen,It was originally just four figures but Tom added two more today.
30-10-2020T01:14:33,unsteddyphoenix,"mmm, nora card? Or just randomly coloured"
30-10-2020T01:14:45,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:
30-10-2020T01:14:52,FenceEqualizer,Probably Nora’d
30-10-2020T01:15:01,SageSaga,he said Nora card earlier
30-10-2020T01:15:01,InTheLionsDen,Tom said it was a Nora card
30-10-2020T01:15:03,Ordithus,Rose's age chart sketch for ya teddy https://www.patreon.com/posts/roselyn-age-34340048
30-10-2020T01:15:06,unsteddyphoenix,Ah ok. Thought maybe Tom wanted to show us all forms of Rose before he kills her D:
30-10-2020T01:15:14,Ordithus,Hm from Feb this year
30-10-2020T01:15:15,unsteddyphoenix,again
30-10-2020T01:15:22,Ordithus,again again
30-10-2020T01:15:24,unsteddyphoenix,Ahhh nice ty
30-10-2020T01:15:33,FenceEqualizer,Phe’s just going to make sure Rose sees Saria again
30-10-2020T01:16:15,Ordithus,February seems like such a completely different world from now
30-10-2020T01:16:21,Dadrobit,Question. Is a winged lion a particular creature? Distinct from like a winged chimera?
30-10-2020T01:16:45,SageSaga,shes a Sphinx right?
30-10-2020T01:16:46,unsteddyphoenix,Its a dnd creature I heard
30-10-2020T01:16:54,Ordithus,sphinx yes
30-10-2020T01:16:55,TheSexyBeast,Manticore?
30-10-2020T01:17:01,Dadrobit,Like a gryphon is an eagle with a lions body. But Shari is a lion with wings.
30-10-2020T01:17:06,unsteddyphoenix,"This is it https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/gynosphinx#:~:text=The%20sphinx%20is%20a%209th,components%20to%20cast%20its%20spells."
30-10-2020T01:17:39,Ordithus,"""monstrosity"" how rude"
30-10-2020T01:17:58,unsteddyphoenix,More like. Large cutie. !!!
30-10-2020T01:18:01,SageSaga,monstrosity is a catch all creature type to include magical beasts
30-10-2020T01:18:53,SageSaga,they couldnt call them magical beasts anymore because the Druid shapechanging was beasts only and they felt people would mistake Magical Beasts as Beasts as well
30-10-2020T01:18:54,FenceEqualizer,First time seeing Gynosphinx.
30-10-2020T01:19:07,Dadrobit,Is she specifically that? Google-fu is also pulling up Griffin (as opposed to gryphon)
30-10-2020T01:19:10,SageSaga,its just a Female Sphinx
30-10-2020T01:19:11,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I absolutely would argue that lol
30-10-2020T01:19:36,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, that is what she was based on unless im totally misremembering"
30-10-2020T01:20:00,SageSaga,no as i said- Tom said shes a Sphinx from the Minecraft Maze
30-10-2020T01:20:09,Dadrobit,I wouldn't doubt it.
30-10-2020T01:20:47,Dadrobit,Still need to find the time to hop on and try that maze.
30-10-2020T01:21:17,unsteddyphoenix,Its a fun half hour
30-10-2020T01:21:44,Dadrobit,Half hour total or per route?
30-10-2020T01:22:22,Dadrobit,"Iirc, there were multiple story paths Tom was trying to implement."
30-10-2020T01:22:26,unsteddyphoenix,"Uhh, hm. Well depends how lost you get lol."
30-10-2020T01:22:33,Ordithus,very. lost.
30-10-2020T01:22:42,unsteddyphoenix,If you wanna 100% it it'll take a loooot longer. Loooots of secrets in there
30-10-2020T01:22:43,Ordithus,I died :cw0lfmare-Paperflora:
30-10-2020T01:22:54,Dadrobit,RIP Ord.
30-10-2020T01:23:01,Sclimshady,I 100% it
30-10-2020T01:23:15,Sclimshady,Too easy if you just got good Teddy
30-10-2020T01:23:33,Ordithus,I watched kame go the Yena route so went the other way
30-10-2020T01:24:22,unsteddyphoenix,But did you REALLY 100% it
30-10-2020T01:24:31,Sclimshady,Sahari was the superior route anyways
30-10-2020T01:24:38,Sclimshady,Yes
30-10-2020T01:24:44,Sclimshady,I think
30-10-2020T01:24:52,Sclimshady,I was told I did
30-10-2020T01:24:54,Dadrobit,Is there a walkthrough on GameFAQs I can use to get the platinum?
30-10-2020T01:25:30,unsteddyphoenix,Yes but instead of gameFAQs its unsteddyFAQs
30-10-2020T01:25:49,Dadrobit,Sounds reliable!
30-10-2020T01:25:51,unsteddyphoenix,And instead of you reading all the answers I smugly tease you when you go the wrong way
30-10-2020T01:26:08,Dadrobit,Also kinda sounds like GameFAQs
30-10-2020T01:26:23,unsteddyphoenix,"Really adds to the experience. Not necessarily in a good way, but it adds"
30-10-2020T01:27:01,SageSaga,"""Alright thanks for using my Walkthrough for the game -hope you had fun- oh and btw there was actually a way to save Aerith but since you were lazy and used my walkthrough i gave you her bad end- sucker!"""
30-10-2020T01:27:01,Dadrobit,It's the surprise mechanics of walkthroughs
30-10-2020T01:27:14,Ordithus,nooooooo
30-10-2020T01:27:22,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha
30-10-2020T01:27:42,unsteddyphoenix,"""you get what you deserve :clown::clown::clown:"""
30-10-2020T01:27:44,Dadrobit,Has it been long enough to talk about FF7 Remake and theories?
30-10-2020T01:28:10,Dadrobit,Because I got em
30-10-2020T01:28:32,SageSaga,no because it doesnt come out till next year
30-10-2020T01:28:45,unsteddyphoenix,"Aerith lives, Tifa dies but Cloud hooks up with Barret"
30-10-2020T01:29:09,Dadrobit,"Unsteddy, you're not far off."
30-10-2020T01:29:35,DarthRexKing,Oh. . . . .missed tom. .w.
30-10-2020T01:29:47,SageSaga,did yall see that joke article of AOC with her arm replaced with a gun?
30-10-2020T01:29:59,Ordithus,nope
30-10-2020T01:30:00,DarthRexKing,No. o3o
30-10-2020T01:30:12,Dadrobit,"If they have any balls at all, instead of always killing Aerith, they're gonna kill whoever the player chooses as the romantic interest."
30-10-2020T01:30:22,SageSaga,"it was like ""AOC loses arm, replaces it with machine gun and demands we save the planet!"""
30-10-2020T01:30:31,Dadrobit,No! I need to see it.
30-10-2020T01:30:41,unsteddyphoenix,Thatd be such a power play
30-10-2020T01:30:49,Ordithus,"lets be real, that would have to be Aerith. She is <3 in the remake"
30-10-2020T01:31:15,SageSaga,AOC gun arm - https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EaW-bPqXsAEBHnR.jpg
30-10-2020T01:31:21,Dadrobit,Tifa is objectively the correct decision in the original at least.
30-10-2020T01:31:48,Ordithus,looks good on her
30-10-2020T01:31:51,Dadrobit,"Lmfao, I hope she sees it, I bet she'd get a kick out of it."
30-10-2020T01:32:22,SageSaga,i dunno if she would get it- not sure about her history with gaming- but shes the right age XD
30-10-2020T01:33:07,Dadrobit,She's a gamer. She just had a stream the other day where she was playing Among Us. She also plays LoL as well iirc.
30-10-2020T01:33:20,Ordithus,does she come from a coal mining town
30-10-2020T01:34:06,SageSaga,playing Among us does not make a person a gamer- it has to be a history of playing games or interest in them
30-10-2020T01:34:47,unsteddyphoenix,Wow keep those gates sage
30-10-2020T01:34:55,SageSaga,i watched her play- it was great that she used that groups term for being used
30-10-2020T01:35:28,Dadrobit,"Unsteddy, I doubt they'll do it. Tetsuya is the same director who took the idea of ""it'd be cool to put Final Fantasy characters and abilities into Disney stories,"" and then by the third main installment he had completely removed the FF characters."
30-10-2020T01:35:36,Dadrobit,And most of the abilities.
30-10-2020T01:35:41,SageSaga,my gate is simple XD but we know she did the among us thing to promote younger people voting
30-10-2020T01:36:27,unsteddyphoenix,Really? damn final fantasy characters were some of the best parts of KH
30-10-2020T01:36:33,Dadrobit,In exchange for disney rides and the most absurdist storyline ever half-concieved.
30-10-2020T01:36:34,unsteddyphoenix,And I didnt even know any of them at the time
30-10-2020T01:36:43,SageSaga,its not like i want to know her hours for her favorite game or what her favorite games are- i just want to know if she grew up playing games or is it just a recent thing
30-10-2020T01:37:01,SpazztasticKiwi,🦉
30-10-2020T01:37:20,SpazztasticKiwi,do you think owls are constantly internally screaming
30-10-2020T01:37:45,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I think they patched some in after release from the backlash, but I couldn't tell you, I returned it to GameStop fairly immediately m"
30-10-2020T01:40:12,Dadrobit,I remember being incredibly disappointed in it after they even made a giant in-your-face tie in to the mobile game.
30-10-2020T01:40:24,Dadrobit,During the final boss
30-10-2020T01:41:00,Dadrobit,"Like, you made the loot box simulator game a giant canon aspect, but you couldn't fucking even fit Sephiroth????"
30-10-2020T01:41:32,unsteddyphoenix,No sephiroth secret boss big cry
30-10-2020T01:42:10,Dadrobit,No arena at all either.
30-10-2020T01:42:57,Dadrobit,They substituted arena-esque fights you could try in different areas spread out around the world's in the post-game.
30-10-2020T01:44:46,Dadrobit,It was just one giant disappointment imho. I don't agree whatsoever with all the perfect scores it got.
30-10-2020T01:44:52,FenceEqualizer,If it helps the dlc has final fantasy characters
30-10-2020T01:45:01,FenceEqualizer,All for five minutes!
30-10-2020T01:45:27,Dadrobit,"Wait, they made the Final Fantasy characters dlc??? Like, you have to pay extra, it's not just patched in?"
30-10-2020T01:46:01,FenceEqualizer,If you’re still talking about kh3 then yes
30-10-2020T01:46:07,FenceEqualizer,For a short period of time
30-10-2020T01:46:11,Dadrobit,Fuck off with that...
30-10-2020T01:47:08,Dadrobit,"So yeah, I have very little confidence in the upcoming sequels to FF7 Remake. Just you fukkin watch, they're gonna make the Golden Saucer a DLC."
30-10-2020T01:47:29,FenceEqualizer,Doubt it. It’s too important to the story
30-10-2020T01:48:00,Dadrobit,"Yeah, the FF characters used to be pretty important to the Kingdom Hearts story too."
30-10-2020T01:49:07,FenceEqualizer,Yeah but Nomura thought the kingdom hearts characters and disney could hold the story up on a sequel. Despite FF7 remake zaniness at the end they seem to be following closely to the story
30-10-2020T01:49:17,Ordithus,:eyes: fade to black
30-10-2020T01:49:58,SageSaga,not the sexy kind though XD
30-10-2020T01:50:10,FenceEqualizer,Not to mention if they are following the story then they can’t do some crazy arse pull and make good saucer dlc. Not when it ends up tying heavily into barrets story
30-10-2020T01:50:14,ZRO4825,So more the Metallica kind?
30-10-2020T01:50:19,Dadrobit,"No way, that ""zaniness"" at the end was 100% them saying, ""The original no longer matters"""
30-10-2020T01:51:12,FenceEqualizer,I don't think it means it no longer matters. More like new things can happen because the fanbase spirits are dead.
30-10-2020T01:51:52,FenceEqualizer,Trying so hard not to go spoiler mode.
30-10-2020T01:52:18,ZRO4825,Appreciated. I still need to finish Remake.
30-10-2020T01:52:58,FenceEqualizer,Square knows they can't fook up to much on the project.  FF7 is too big to risk another Final Fantasy 15
30-10-2020T01:53:46,ZRO4825,"Aight, ya'll have fun. My work day took it out of me, so I'm headed off.  ^^/"
30-10-2020T01:53:56,Ordithus,night zro
30-10-2020T01:53:57,FenceEqualizer,Have a good night ZRO
30-10-2020T01:54:19,Dadrobit,"It already is as far as I'm concerned. I have very little hope, and even less faith that the sequels are going to be what was originally advertised."
30-10-2020T01:54:28,Dadrobit,o/ ZRO
30-10-2020T01:55:52,FenceEqualizer,I don't know. I think new fans are eatting it up and as an old fan I like the direction it's going. The game was fun. The story was their and I kinda like how I can experience the thrill of ff7 in a different light cause I don't know if things'll change.
30-10-2020T01:56:36,SageSaga,take care Zro
30-10-2020T01:56:48,FenceEqualizer,Also kh3 while I loved it needed more Final Fantasy I will admit that was the big dumb.
30-10-2020T01:57:14,Ordithus,"the original ff7 still exists, too"
30-10-2020T01:57:19,Dadrobit,Be back in a bit. Party is getting too rowdy.
30-10-2020T01:57:32,FenceEqualizer,True. Also alrighty Robit

30-10-2020T02:02:37,SageSaga,that reminds me - i watched a catgirl vtuber get drunk and play Dark souls 3 and it was hilarious
30-10-2020T02:02:56,unsteddyphoenix,Was it Nyanners by any chance?
30-10-2020T02:03:16,SageSaga,yeeeeep
30-10-2020T02:03:33,unsteddyphoenix,"Haha nice. Ive been subbed to her for a while, shes pretty hilarious"

30-10-2020T02:04:30,unsteddyphoenix,The only asmr content I enjoy
30-10-2020T02:05:21,FenceEqualizer,Who can also apparently sing really well.

30-10-2020T02:07:12,AspiringNoodle,"Gonna watch that vid, should be funny"
30-10-2020T02:07:31,AspiringNoodle,That said... cable: garbage or okay?
30-10-2020T02:07:52,AspiringNoodle,"I've noticed that I only watch a handful of channels these days, for only a few shows, and most of the time I use it as background noise :|"
30-10-2020T02:08:31,Ordithus,have not had tv service in many years
30-10-2020T02:08:40,Ordithus,not worth the cost
30-10-2020T02:09:02,FenceEqualizer,I was going to say it's not worth it but with EVERYTHING becoming subcription I don't know
30-10-2020T02:09:07,AspiringNoodle,Heck... I'd just throw picarto streams on it if I didn't want to chat xD
30-10-2020T02:09:23,FenceEqualizer,I really hope the subcription phase collapse upon itself like a dying star.
30-10-2020T02:10:15,AspiringNoodle,"Cable is basically the old-school subscription service.  Problem being that they charge you an arm and a leg for a BUNCH of content you're not interested in, and then it's still all supplemented with advertisements :P"

30-10-2020T02:21:55,FenceEqualizer,They want them anime girls. Even if there's a chance they're G.I.R.L

30-10-2020T02:24:27,FenceEqualizer,Roomies are out doing the same damn thing.
30-10-2020T02:24:35,Dadrobit,I actually laughed in their face. I couldn't help it.
30-10-2020T02:25:05,TheSexyBeast,"You were on candid camera, right?"
30-10-2020T02:25:29,Dadrobit,"Yeah, my camera is always rolling whenever I have to go talk to people."
30-10-2020T02:25:32,TheSexyBeast,Was there a laugh track playing?
30-10-2020T02:26:24,Dadrobit,"Only me. But they did agree to shut it down for the night, already past midnight and curfew for parties was an hour ago."
30-10-2020T02:27:09,TheSexyBeast,I don't envy your job.
30-10-2020T02:27:45,Dadrobit,It's great 99.9% of the time.
30-10-2020T02:28:07,FenceEqualizer,Just those .01% times that get ya
30-10-2020T02:28:59,Dadrobit,"And they give me the best stories. Like a bride's maid getting leg swept by a fire marshal, and the ""well I don't see a 'no sex allowed' sign"" guy."
30-10-2020T02:29:48,FenceEqualizer,Okay. Can I get the abridge version of the fire marshal story?
30-10-2020T02:29:57,FenceEqualizer,Also I miss overlord.
30-10-2020T02:30:44,TheSexyBeast,Insert Tommy Lee Jones stare emoji *here*
30-10-2020T02:31:40,Dadrobit,"Unlicensed, unmonitored use of fireworks at a wedding sets the golf course on fire. Fire Marshal shows up. Drunk as fuck bride's maid gets in Marshal's face for ""ruining"" the wedding. Fire Marshal doesn't take any shit and fukkin drops the lady."
30-10-2020T02:32:01,unsteddyphoenix,karen'd
30-10-2020T02:32:11,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-laura: nice
30-10-2020T02:32:29,FenceEqualizer,:ptv-laugh: Kazuma would be proud.
30-10-2020T02:32:33,TheSexyBeast,👍
30-10-2020T02:33:31,Dadrobit,Cleanest fucking sweep I've ever seen. Mind you bride's maid was over 6ft and FM was like 5'4''. Absolutely hilarious.
30-10-2020T02:33:43,TheSexyBeast,"I'm going to call it a night, thanks for the stream Sage."
30-10-2020T02:33:49,Dadrobit,She wasn't taking any shit from that lady.
30-10-2020T02:33:52,Ordithus,night sexy
30-10-2020T02:34:00,Dadrobit,o/ beast
30-10-2020T02:34:01,FenceEqualizer,Have a goodnight Beast.
30-10-2020T02:34:02,unsteddyphoenix,Thats pretty badass
30-10-2020T02:34:06,TheSexyBeast,\o
30-10-2020T02:34:06,unsteddyphoenix,Night sexy~
30-10-2020T02:34:49,FenceEqualizer,That is pretty badass. Can't believe the woman got made after having the golf course light on freaking fire
30-10-2020T02:35:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I had a lady order a sandwich tray for tomorrow to throw a party for the kids since they couldn’t go out trick or treating
30-10-2020T02:35:11,Dadrobit,It was a small fire at least.
30-10-2020T02:35:19,SpazztasticKiwi,let that sink in
30-10-2020T02:37:09,FenceEqualizer,At this point I am not surprise. People still want kids to go trick or treating.
30-10-2020T02:38:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"so because trick or treating is canceled because of covid (& it’s cold), you’re gonna have a party.....aiight"
30-10-2020T02:38:37,Dadrobit,"I mean, it's probably still a better choice than trick or treating, spazz. A dozen people coming over that you know is objectively better than meeting with several dozen who each will have interacted with dozens of others within just a few hours"
30-10-2020T02:39:13,AspiringNoodle,But there's also the prolonged exposure element combined with being indoors
30-10-2020T02:39:14,FenceEqualizer,Truee. It's like the lesser of evils. Mind you I'd rather not do either.
30-10-2020T02:39:27,AspiringNoodle,"And if nobody is wearing masks during the entire thing, then it gets even worse."
30-10-2020T02:39:27,SpazztasticKiwi,but it’s kids
30-10-2020T02:39:29,Dadrobit,Especially if it's just in the family for the party.
30-10-2020T02:39:45,FenceEqualizer,Hand out a cart of disinfected sprays.
30-10-2020T02:39:56,SpazztasticKiwi,kids are walking petri dishes
30-10-2020T02:40:01,AspiringNoodle,"Also, would like to remind about that funeral months back that resulted in like 28 positive cases"
30-10-2020T02:40:11,FenceEqualizer,Jesus.
30-10-2020T02:40:20,SpazztasticKiwi,they don’t need to be in a gathering any more than adults
30-10-2020T02:40:29,SpazztasticKiwi,not to mention it’s flu season
30-10-2020T02:41:29,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, looking at the graphs for the past few weeks"
30-10-2020T02:41:36,AspiringNoodle,'Muricans being 'Muricans alright
30-10-2020T02:41:59,AspiringNoodle,This gonna be a rough winter...  people banking WAY too hard on the vaccine being the panacea to all the bad decisions.
30-10-2020T02:42:18,SpazztasticKiwi,have I mentioned it’s cold yet
30-10-2020T02:42:33,Ordithus,it was a balmy 35 degrees today
30-10-2020T02:43:07,Dadrobit,63 here atm
30-10-2020T02:43:12,SpazztasticKiwi,it says it’s 43 but I’ve been under my blankets with my space heater on high
30-10-2020T02:43:18,SpazztasticKiwi,still half frozen
30-10-2020T02:43:40,Ordithus,upper 60s inside though
30-10-2020T02:43:57,Dadrobit,"Feels absolutely perfect right now,.I've got the door open."
30-10-2020T02:44:05,AspiringNoodle,35 and 88% humid right now
30-10-2020T02:44:25,AspiringNoodle,"No wonder I got to my car and went, ""Really???"" when leaving work"
30-10-2020T02:45:02,AspiringNoodle,"Thermometer said 39 at the time and I was like ""Huh, maybe I should start wearing my light hoodie"" when walking to the car beforehand xD"
30-10-2020T02:46:04,Dadrobit,"""light hoodie"". Man, I got my layered jacket ready in case it dips too low into the 50's."
30-10-2020T02:46:50,AspiringNoodle,"Ohoho, Arizonians ;P"
30-10-2020T02:46:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I wear coats in 90 degrees
30-10-2020T02:47:06,SpazztasticKiwi,imagine me now that it’s under 60
30-10-2020T02:47:18,AspiringNoodle,"Meanwhile, Canadians in 9 degree weather wearing nothing but underwear: ""It's gettin' a bit chilly out, eh?"""
30-10-2020T02:47:28,AspiringNoodle,"""Yeah, maybe we should put some socks on."""
30-10-2020T02:48:47,Ordithus,lemme tell you. -40. It's cold. Beyond cold.
30-10-2020T02:48:52,Ordithus,Avoid it if you can
30-10-2020T02:49:13,Dadrobit,I usually do
30-10-2020T02:50:02,Ordithus,"exposed skin at that temp hurts, bad"
30-10-2020T02:50:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll move planets before staying in that for any length of time
30-10-2020T02:50:37,Ordithus,bad news spazz
30-10-2020T02:50:40,Ordithus,space is cold
30-10-2020T02:51:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d be on a rocket obviously
30-10-2020T02:51:19,unsteddyphoenix,Rockets are also cold
30-10-2020T02:51:23,unsteddyphoenix,Unless youre at the end bit
30-10-2020T02:51:29,SageSaga,wat
30-10-2020T02:51:29,Ordithus,or in it
30-10-2020T02:52:16,SageSaga,look- one of the most dangerous parts of being on a space ship is heat- because you cant use the cold of space to cool off
30-10-2020T02:52:41,unsteddyphoenix,not with that attitude
30-10-2020T02:52:49,SageSaga,no because of science
30-10-2020T02:53:02,unsteddyphoenix,Just hang off the edge dont be a little baby
30-10-2020T02:53:08,SageSaga,its a vacuum - its a perfect insulator
30-10-2020T02:53:23,SageSaga,you cannot transfer heat through nothingness!
30-10-2020T02:53:25,Ordithus,thermal radiation
30-10-2020T02:53:33,SpazztasticKiwi,and we’re taking the idea of me moving planets seriously now
30-10-2020T02:53:45,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s 3 am
30-10-2020T02:53:48,Ordithus,"one day, someone will be serious about that"
30-10-2020T02:53:49,unsteddyphoenix,Youre saying you cant lose body heat in space?
30-10-2020T02:53:52,Ordithus,why not now!
30-10-2020T02:54:09,unsteddyphoenix,because it has nowhere to go?
30-10-2020T02:54:21,SageSaga,it does have somewhere to go though-
30-10-2020T02:54:41,SageSaga,as your blood boils and steams out it will take the heat with it
30-10-2020T02:54:50,AspiringNoodle,"^ dangit, I was about to say that, lol"
30-10-2020T02:55:01,unsteddyphoenix,Thats wild
30-10-2020T02:55:03,SageSaga,and your blood isnt boiling because its so hot
30-10-2020T02:55:07,Ordithus,"the blood boiling myth is about the pressure, isn't it"
30-10-2020T02:55:11,AspiringNoodle,"In the vacuum of space, any exposed liquids in your body will instantly boil :ptv-hearts:"
30-10-2020T02:55:15,unsteddyphoenix,Put your head in a water bucket
30-10-2020T02:55:54,SageSaga,yeah in a vacum with no gravity liquids turn to a gas
30-10-2020T02:56:02,SageSaga,even water
30-10-2020T02:56:21,unsteddyphoenix,You also cant get an erection in 0-g
30-10-2020T02:56:25,SageSaga,in gravity it will freeze and boil
30-10-2020T02:56:33,Ordithus,not necessarily... I could look it up and see if that is reasonable at body temp
30-10-2020T02:56:53,Ordithus,would you boil water by just putting it in a vacuum?
30-10-2020T02:57:26,AspiringNoodle,"Yes, there are specialized vacuum chambers that can show a goldilocks zone where water can effectively exist in all 3 phases"
30-10-2020T02:57:47,Ordithus,"the temperature needs to be controlled, too"
30-10-2020T02:58:26,AspiringNoodle,"But effectively, as surrounding pressure goes down, the amount of energy needed for water to boil / evaporate goes down, as well"
30-10-2020T02:59:06,AspiringNoodle,"People who have climbed some of the tallest mountains in the world have shown that at high enough altitudes, the energy radiated from your skin is enough to boil water."
30-10-2020T03:00:07,Ordithus,"huh, looks like water would boil at about 32 F in a vacuum"
30-10-2020T03:02:29,Ordithus,and is also the triple point. fun
30-10-2020T03:03:02,SageSaga,gnight folks
30-10-2020T03:03:15,Ordithus,"looks good sage, thanks for the stream"

30-10-2020T13:08:58,AspiringNoodle,Oof... welp... PACER is gonna die quickly
30-10-2020T13:23:28,Ordithus,"AMC Pacer? Of course, it's an AMC"
30-10-2020T13:27:56,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
30-10-2020T13:28:23,AspiringNoodle,It's a new racing game
30-10-2020T13:29:50,AspiringNoodle,It's a zero-G battle racer.  Think F-Zero or Tube Slider (if you ever heard of it) combine with the chaos of Mario Kart
30-10-2020T13:30:36,AspiringNoodle,"Apparently they licensed some pretty kickass music to play in the game, but they're saying not to stream it because it can result in instant copyright claims..."
30-10-2020T13:30:51,AspiringNoodle,"Yes, that's a f***ing brilliant move in 2020"
30-10-2020T13:31:12,AspiringNoodle,"Make a cool racing game with awesome music, but then make it unstreamable because it can destroy channels"
30-10-2020T13:31:38,Dadrobit,Such is copyright my dude.
30-10-2020T13:32:54,Dadrobit,Gotta get those Compulsory Licenses for that.
30-10-2020T13:33:20,AspiringNoodle,Their game is still good as dead :|
30-10-2020T13:34:31,Ordithus,can't streamers turn the music down or off?
30-10-2020T13:34:34,Ordithus,Add their own
30-10-2020T13:35:26,Dadrobit,"Yeah, so long as dialogue, sfx, and music have their own sound level options, it'd be fine."
30-10-2020T13:35:31,AspiringNoodle,They might be able to.  The game should have options to turn off the music.
30-10-2020T13:35:56,AspiringNoodle,"But it's one of those things where you'd only know about the ""don't stream the music"" HUGE asterisk is if you saw their twitter when they made the post"
30-10-2020T13:36:28,AspiringNoodle,"So what will inevitably happen is the game launches, people start streaming it, they get hit with all kinds of claims, learn about that little detail afterwards, and tons of negative PR arises as a result"
30-10-2020T13:37:14,Ordithus,They could patch a warning in - I think some games have done that sort of thing
30-10-2020T13:37:35,Ordithus,"""Want to stream or record? Here, turn off our music"""
30-10-2020T13:38:27,Dadrobit,"Looking it up now, it's literally Wipeout."
30-10-2020T13:39:20,AspiringNoodle,"tl;dr, given how big streaming is these days"
30-10-2020T13:39:34,AspiringNoodle,It's a pretty dumb idea to make your game hostile to streamers
30-10-2020T13:41:44,Dadrobit,"I can find literally nothing on what you're claiming, Noodle. Everything I'm seeing is saying that it's an original ost by Tim Wright, the same dude that did Wipeout."
30-10-2020T13:42:56,AspiringNoodle,https://twitter.com/R8Games/status/1321670534245969920
30-10-2020T13:44:39,AspiringNoodle,"Someone in the comments had a good idea, ""stream mode"".  Turn off the songs that will be an issue."
30-10-2020T13:45:02,Dadrobit,"Reading those replies now, seems it's gonna be patched in."
30-10-2020T13:45:26,AspiringNoodle,Excellent.  Hopefully that's a pop-up that happens when opening the game for the first time.
30-10-2020T13:45:50,Dadrobit,"Holy Shit, Sean Connery just died..."
30-10-2020T13:45:54,AspiringNoodle,Yup :|
30-10-2020T13:53:33,Dadrobit,"Also, 3 days of early voting left, and AZ has nearly hit 90% of the total votes for all of 2016. I can't goddamn wait to have Senator Mark Kelly in office."
30-10-2020T13:53:54,Dadrobit,"(Also, hopefully legal weed, also on the ballot)"
30-10-2020T13:54:49,AspiringNoodle,Oooooooooo
30-10-2020T13:56:10,AspiringNoodle,I should check to see if my polling place is currently open
30-10-2020T13:56:17,AspiringNoodle,Just realized that I work on election day -3-
30-10-2020T13:57:24,Dadrobit,I love early ballots. Get to spend however much time I want or need researching everything on the ballot instead of being put on the spot at a station.
30-10-2020T13:58:03,Dadrobit,"Helped a shitload this time for sure. Had like 30 judges on the ""Retain? Yes/No"" list."

30-10-2020T14:02:17,Dadrobit,Took me most of a day to sort them all.
30-10-2020T14:02:27,Dadrobit,o/
30-10-2020T14:03:00,Ordithus,yikes dadro that's a few
30-10-2020T14:03:07,Dadrobit,I couldn't imagine seriously being able to look at that list on the spot in a polling station and making a decision on them.
30-10-2020T14:03:14,Ordithus,"How ya doin, sage? Hi sun!"
30-10-2020T14:03:33,Ordithus,Or remembering what you decided earlier
30-10-2020T14:03:39,Dadrobit,Exactly.
30-10-2020T14:03:55,Ordithus,And just how long that would take to fill out
30-10-2020T14:04:14,AspiringNoodle,Hoi sage :)
30-10-2020T14:04:21,AspiringNoodle,"Also, US elections are a joke, lol"
30-10-2020T14:04:34,Ordithus,My polling place is literally in my backyard. Still voted by mail aha
30-10-2020T14:04:35,AspiringNoodle,"""Voting is a critical duty of American citizens!"""
30-10-2020T14:04:49,Dadrobit,"I'm glad I did. Looking at some of the listings, judges are actually crazy close elections sometimes, and they get super low turnout in actual votes cast."
30-10-2020T14:04:49,AspiringNoodle,*does almost nothing to ensure people vote or have time to be informed on their vote*
30-10-2020T14:05:33,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I dropped my ballot off at my local station, .4 miles away, convenient enough lol."
30-10-2020T14:05:56,Dadrobit,And some of them I absolutely want gone.
30-10-2020T14:06:06,AspiringNoodle,"Fun fact, we don't even have a constitutional guarantee to vote"
30-10-2020T14:06:27,AspiringNoodle,Now would be a good time to start fixing up these issues xD
30-10-2020T14:07:05,Dadrobit,Was reading up on one who refused to let a gay couple get divorced because he didn't think they should have been able to marry in the first place. Then he went on to block any form of an appeal so they are stuck together unable to marry anyone else.

30-10-2020T16:02:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I found him when I noticed the suspicious lump
30-10-2020T16:03:03,SageSaga,wrong- Obiwan did kill him- but it was on Tatooine
30-10-2020T16:03:15,SpazztasticKiwi,don’t know how he got there in the night

30-10-2020T16:03:36,Ordithus,and the music

30-10-2020T16:04:12,SageSaga,its a trick question- because he appeared to die on Naboo- since he was- cut in half
30-10-2020T16:04:14,SageSaga,but he survived
30-10-2020T16:04:30,SpazztasticKiwi,and that vader never runs in the movies
30-10-2020T16:05:07,BadFoMo,Was the death on Tatooine part of the MM Canon or the Real Canon?
30-10-2020T16:05:09,AspiringNoodle,Does Maul make a reapparance in any future films?
30-10-2020T16:05:12,SageSaga,later he tracked down Obiwan on Naboo watching over Luke- and there they fought the last time
30-10-2020T16:05:29,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, you're including animated series lore, lol"
30-10-2020T16:05:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"never seen the mess, don’t want to anymore"

30-10-2020T16:07:09,SpazztasticKiwi,so was the emoji movie technically
30-10-2020T16:07:21,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, but did you hear about the major flops that resulted?"
30-10-2020T16:07:24,SageSaga,its funny when you can make a terrible movie but still make bank on it XD
30-10-2020T16:07:28,BadFoMo,@AspiringNoodle That's why my 'friend' stopped being a fan.
30-10-2020T16:08:04,Ordithus,"Eh, the plot is wack but the spectacle is incredible and it's quite the ride. Movie magic is there"
30-10-2020T16:08:11,AspiringNoodle,Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge is a complete financial failure
30-10-2020T16:08:15,Ordithus,"It's mostly surface deep, though"

30-10-2020T16:09:01,SageSaga,didnt that open like just before Covid though noodle?
30-10-2020T16:09:51,AspiringNoodle,I'd need to check.  I think it opened up early enough that COVID wasn't an issue
30-10-2020T16:10:09,SpazztasticKiwi,oh you know there’s theaters opening back up
30-10-2020T16:10:29,AspiringNoodle,Yeah.  Mine did.  For a month.  Before the company decided to shut everything down again.
30-10-2020T16:10:39,SpazztasticKiwi,& one I heard was offering online theater showings.....
30-10-2020T16:11:01,AspiringNoodle,They were offering $5 viewings of great movies from the past decade or two to try and get people back.
30-10-2020T16:11:12,SpazztasticKiwi,like you can’t just rent or buy a movie on netflix instead

30-10-2020T16:12:02,BadFoMo,@SpazztasticKiwi And stay safe inside while you're at it..
30-10-2020T16:13:01,SageSaga,theme parks function differently from movies- where their income is based off of years of running - your first year is vital to get people coming by word of mouth and reviews- but they werent open for a full year before we lost a year

30-10-2020T16:14:35,BadFoMo,The thing with the bubble?
30-10-2020T16:14:35,AspiringNoodle,"Emperor Palpatine: ""doit."""
30-10-2020T16:15:18,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah like the bubble backpack but this one turns into a mini tent so you can picnic with your kitty

30-10-2020T16:16:06,SageSaga,this article is tiny- doesnt have much information- and was based on less than 3 months of it being open-
30-10-2020T16:17:07,CrRAR,I’d imagine some cats would be okay with that and others would absolutely hate it.
30-10-2020T16:17:12,SageSaga,i dont think you can gauge a theme parks success in under a year- they just dont work that way- people plan these trips out months in advance
30-10-2020T16:17:32,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s even got a tiny internal travel fan
30-10-2020T16:17:42,CrRAR,ooo
30-10-2020T16:17:51,AspiringNoodle,"Still, it's a STAR WARS theme park"

30-10-2020T16:43:29,SpazztasticKiwi,the only reason I get that meme is I’ve seen something something the dude killed a bunch of kids at some point

30-10-2020T16:47:18,SageSaga,you dont make alignment checks and you cant fumble saves or skill checks
30-10-2020T16:47:59,SageSaga,Hogan is piling on the homebrew
30-10-2020T16:48:25,Ordithus,homebrew can be fun though

30-10-2020T16:49:43,Hogan,"... though I think I've at least heard about rules, homebrew or not, where you make a ""save roll"" to avoid the alignment shift..."
30-10-2020T16:49:47,SpazztasticKiwi,this is geek talk isn’t it
30-10-2020T16:49:58,AspiringNoodle,D&D geek talk

30-10-2020T21:07:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"wrong doll - this is Chucky, not Barbie"
30-10-2020T21:10:14,CrRAR,Hey at least Chucky has a “can do” attitude!
30-10-2020T21:10:32,CrRAR,Very determined
30-10-2020T21:11:26,CrRAR,Anyone watching halloweeny movies?

30-10-2020T21:13:33,AspiringNoodle,Maybe just the horror genre in general xD
30-10-2020T21:13:41,AspiringNoodle,Lights Out greatest horror movie I've watched in recent years
30-10-2020T21:13:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I was thinking about a movie
30-10-2020T21:15:18,BlackjackSec99,.... I missed a stream?
30-10-2020T21:15:52,Ordithus,eh?
30-10-2020T21:16:14,Ordithus,Tom streamed last night
30-10-2020T21:16:57,BlackjackSec99,"ahh, its listed as 10-31 so i was confuzzled"
30-10-2020T21:18:14,SpazztasticKiwi,ghost shark looks promising
30-10-2020T21:18:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom popped in for a total of five minutes awhile ago that I could tell
30-10-2020T21:28:34,CrRAR,Have you been on a horror movie marathon binge?
30-10-2020T21:29:49,SpazztasticKiwi,nah but I could use one
30-10-2020T21:30:04,SpazztasticKiwi,might have one for the next two days
30-10-2020T21:31:11,SpazztasticKiwi,romantic binge would be annoying
30-10-2020T21:31:41,SpazztasticKiwi,so release the creatures
30-10-2020T21:40:54,CrRAR,"Yeah, romance stuff best in small doses."
30-10-2020T21:41:03,CrRAR,Can’t wear out the feels.
30-10-2020T21:42:12,CrRAR,After halloween can’t forget to watch V for Vendetta
30-10-2020T21:42:31,CrRAR,"“Remember, remember the 5th of November” and all that"
30-10-2020T21:42:56,SpazztasticKiwi,romance is better with someone
30-10-2020T21:43:12,SpazztasticKiwi,but horror is good with someone too
30-10-2020T21:43:53,SpazztasticKiwi,going back to my ex it’s just I rarely watched horror with anyone since he didn’t like it
30-10-2020T21:44:40,SpazztasticKiwi,when is better to yell at the stupid humans than alone tho

30-10-2020T22:45:29,AspiringNoodle,Just shy of 100k new COVID cases yesterday
30-10-2020T22:45:49,AspiringNoodle,"It's like, how many people need to f*cking die before they pull their heads out of their asses and take this seriously?"
30-10-2020T23:06:18,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,It’s no longer Halloween :(

30-10-2020T23:06:41,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,I didn’t like treat or treaters because of spreading COVID
30-10-2020T23:09:17,AspiringNoodle,"Ironically, trick or treating is probably one of the safest Halloween activities possible."
30-10-2020T23:10:05,AspiringNoodle,"Aside from the close contact at the door when receiving treats, the activity fulfills most other preventative measures, assuming masks are worn."

30-10-2020T23:16:25,Ordithus,the scariest part will be the unexpected hour in the morning
