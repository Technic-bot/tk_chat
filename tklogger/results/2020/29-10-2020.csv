29-10-2020T20:50:43,Rainelover,I almost decided to say “i am surrounded by idiots” but then i decided not to be an asshole and insult people’s intelligence
29-10-2020T20:51:24,Nekonny,erk

29-10-2020T20:52:10,Rainelover,"Understandable, have a nice day"
29-10-2020T20:52:26,Nekonny,perhaps that wasn't it... this was just the last station that was on when I turned my car on just now
29-10-2020T20:52:55,FFrost,So glad the stations here all have song lists lol

29-10-2020T20:54:17,SageSaga,they have to be consistently annoying for me to consider it
29-10-2020T20:54:27,Ordithus,well fine not goodbye for you
29-10-2020T20:54:36,SageSaga,Raine has definitely been consistently annoying
29-10-2020T20:54:51,FFrost,"Crap, best I can do is sporadic."
29-10-2020T20:54:57,MisterWho,"Oh great, 101.5 the dove has a stream...but not for the EU..."
29-10-2020T20:55:13,Rainelover,"Well I’m sorry about that, I shall try to be less annoying"

29-10-2020T21:21:34,SageSaga,he set it up himself
29-10-2020T21:21:35,Ordithus,not via picarto
29-10-2020T21:21:47,TheSexyBeast,Basitin magic?
29-10-2020T21:21:48,Ordithus,some browser extension and obs?
29-10-2020T21:21:59,MisterWho,"Ahh, very nice tool indeed."
29-10-2020T21:22:03,CrRAR,Sounds logical
29-10-2020T21:22:26,SageSaga,hey maybe i can  do some OBS Magic
29-10-2020T21:22:49,Nekonny,Theres one part of twokinds that I feel like Ive missed

29-10-2020T21:23:17,Nekonny,when trace used to run with team b
29-10-2020T21:23:17,Ordithus,no spoilers :ctwokinds-flomad:
29-10-2020T21:23:44,Nekonny,"I mean, he was grand master templar, and ran with b team"
29-10-2020T21:23:57,Ordithus,"as in, before the comic's events?"
29-10-2020T21:24:05,CrRAR,"Well, Red and him were buds, I’m guessing it was coincidence Red knows Maren?"
29-10-2020T21:24:06,Nekonny,I supose so?
29-10-2020T21:24:09,TheSexyBeast,Red & the Taverndatters?
29-10-2020T21:24:29,Ordithus,before Raine and Sythe entered that scene
29-10-2020T21:24:37,hyneria,when Trace was still an evil necromancer?
29-10-2020T21:24:44,TheSexyBeast,and Zen
29-10-2020T21:24:44,CrRAR,Cuz Trace came from some farm village supposedly
29-10-2020T21:24:49,Ordithus,there was a brief time when a and b were together when Flora was all possessed
29-10-2020T21:24:54,Twokinds,back
29-10-2020T21:24:56,Ordithus,wb
29-10-2020T21:24:58,MisterWho,bw
29-10-2020T21:24:58,TheSexyBeast,and Nibbly
29-10-2020T21:25:02,NezumiYuki,WB Tom
29-10-2020T21:25:03,CrRAR,I’m guessing they met in templat academy
29-10-2020T21:25:06,CrRAR,Wbb
29-10-2020T21:25:08,KeefMcDerpface,wb
29-10-2020T21:25:17,TheSexyBeast,wb
29-10-2020T21:25:23,Nekonny,How long was traces run with the templars?
29-10-2020T21:25:41,Ordithus,they took him as a kid
29-10-2020T21:25:48,CrRAR,He was pretty young that one time he was shown talking w/ Mary
29-10-2020T21:25:49,Ordithus,10-12ish?
29-10-2020T21:26:06,CrRAR,That sounds right
29-10-2020T21:26:24,CrRAR,Though he may have been there already some time?
29-10-2020T21:26:48,Ordithus,he was grand templar for about 4 years I think
29-10-2020T21:26:57,Nekonny,B team seems to remember him with a lot of fondness
29-10-2020T21:27:00,Sesarag,Hello
29-10-2020T21:27:11,CrRAR,I guess Trace went off to templar boarding school for being a naughty boy back home xD
29-10-2020T21:27:32,Nekonny,and GTT (gtand templar trace) seems like an incompatible attitude with that group
29-10-2020T21:27:39,Ordithus,"him and red were friends for years, and he ""dated"" Maren in the months leading up to the current events"
29-10-2020T21:27:44,CrRAR,^
29-10-2020T21:27:46,Nekonny,I mostly ask because I might have missed something
29-10-2020T21:27:54,SageSaga,how do i crop this in OBS-
29-10-2020T21:28:02,hyneria,well Bad Trace used to date Maren
29-10-2020T21:28:06,Ordithus,yeah I don't get what Maren saw in him
29-10-2020T21:28:11,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-eyeroll:
29-10-2020T21:28:14,hyneria,but he just wanted to use her body in a ritual
29-10-2020T21:28:15,Nekonny,crop?
29-10-2020T21:28:32,NezumiYuki,"If the village had any...ANY idea the sort of man Trace might grow up to become, I wonder if sending him to Templar boarding would have been such a good idea?"
29-10-2020T21:28:37,hyneria,by the time Trace meet Maren he was already a monster
29-10-2020T21:28:44,CrRAR,Hate of Keidran and bad-boy energy probably
29-10-2020T21:28:51,Ordithus,"maybe, even though he was a crazy homicidal maniac, he was halfway normal sometimes"
29-10-2020T21:28:56,CrRAR,Plus big house
29-10-2020T21:28:57,Ordithus,when no keidran were around or something
29-10-2020T21:28:59,hyneria,"Had made Rose into what she is now, and created Detritus"
29-10-2020T21:29:03,KeefMcDerpface,"He was Grand Templar so maybe Maren saw a way to ""move up"" in the world?"
29-10-2020T21:29:30,CrRAR,Yeah
29-10-2020T21:29:39,Nekonny,"ugh, my wrist T_T"
29-10-2020T21:29:52,NezumiYuki,Owww @Nekonny
29-10-2020T21:29:58,CrRAR,Even Flora was curious about the mysterious lavishness

29-10-2020T21:30:33,Nekonny,3d stuff
29-10-2020T21:30:35,NezumiYuki,Oh gods... Tom are you really doing this?   A bow on Rose's cow lick?  <3

29-10-2020T21:31:17,MisterWho,cow lick ? O.o
29-10-2020T21:31:28,TheSexyBeast,Cowl lick
29-10-2020T21:31:38,NezumiYuki,"Cow lick, or the silly tuft of hair we see many anime characters have."
29-10-2020T21:31:58,NezumiYuki,"Speaking of which, a certain tiger has two big ones.  xDD"
29-10-2020T21:32:30,TheSexyBeast,Those are just extensions
29-10-2020T21:32:34,Ordithus,the antennae
29-10-2020T21:32:39,Ordithus,they get FM radio
29-10-2020T21:32:43,KeefMcDerpface,lol

29-10-2020T21:34:09,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-MikeLewd: < this would work
29-10-2020T21:34:13,SageSaga,woooow this is annoying XD
29-10-2020T21:34:29,Nekonny,what?
29-10-2020T21:34:30,SageSaga,this should have been so easy-
29-10-2020T21:34:35,Nekonny,pose?
29-10-2020T21:34:48,SageSaga,Spotify changes the window name every time the music changes
29-10-2020T21:34:58,CrRAR,Ah
29-10-2020T21:35:37,Ordithus,obs not like that?
29-10-2020T21:35:38,SageSaga,and OBS captures by window name
29-10-2020T21:35:43,Ordithus,ah
29-10-2020T21:35:43,Nekonny,ah
29-10-2020T21:35:46,CrRAR,Oh lol true
29-10-2020T21:35:47,SageSaga,so every time the song changes it breaks XD
29-10-2020T21:36:42,Nekonny,yopu do it via streamlabs
29-10-2020T21:36:50,Nekonny,if you already have that on OBS
29-10-2020T21:36:59,Nekonny,(sent you a discord link)

29-10-2020T21:39:44,CrRAR,"Probably from climbing trees, falling in wild rose bushes"
29-10-2020T21:39:50,Ordithus,d'aww
29-10-2020T21:39:55,NezumiYuki,Most likely
29-10-2020T21:40:16,TheSexyBeast,Have we ever seen Rose's parents?
29-10-2020T21:40:27,NezumiYuki,I can't recall...
29-10-2020T21:40:34,KeefMcDerpface,I don't think dso.

29-10-2020T21:44:24,KeefMcDerpface,But was it a one time only thing? Let's wait and see.
29-10-2020T21:46:41,Muddy,Is this getting color?
29-10-2020T21:47:06,Ordithus,"a bit of red here, a dash of green there~"
29-10-2020T21:48:16,Nekonny,what did you do?
29-10-2020T21:48:38,Muddy,"Too bad Rose never became a mom.., bet she would have been a good one."
29-10-2020T21:48:53,SageSaga,i just did what i did before- but again
29-10-2020T21:50:07,Nekonny,ah
29-10-2020T21:51:18,SageSaga,apparently i did it right but maybe i made a change while it was transitioning to a new song and got hung up
29-10-2020T21:51:47,Nekonny,:crying_cat_face::boom::raised_back_of_hand::boom:

29-10-2020T21:52:03,Twokinds,tk au where rose has a litter of pups and trace becomes uncle trace and turns good thus resolving everything.
29-10-2020T21:52:04,KeefMcDerpface,ouch
29-10-2020T21:52:17,KeefMcDerpface,awwww

29-10-2020T21:52:24,Ordithus,good au
29-10-2020T21:52:25,Vexd,Sounds wholesome
29-10-2020T21:52:41,NezumiYuki,Man that's an A.U. I'd love to read up on! <3
29-10-2020T21:53:05,Twokinds,I'm not sure why but my hand is hurting a lot too.
29-10-2020T21:53:09,Twokinds,"Or, my drawing wrist."
29-10-2020T21:53:12,SageSaga,but since Trace never meets Flora and they never meet Keith-  everyone else is worse off
29-10-2020T21:53:13,NezumiYuki,OWWW
29-10-2020T21:53:14,MuonNeutrino,the power of cute babies solves all?
29-10-2020T21:53:21,KeefMcDerpface,oh no
29-10-2020T21:53:28,Twokinds,Haven't been putting a lot of strain on it so dunno why. Maybe cold weather related?
29-10-2020T21:53:42,Ordithus,it's contagious :ctwokinds-floAAA:

29-10-2020T21:56:52,MuonNeutrino,so we used them all up several storms ago
29-10-2020T21:56:55,Dadrobit,Who would Rose even have kids with?
29-10-2020T21:56:56,Dragusthor,hi

29-10-2020T21:56:58,MuonNeutrino,yeah zeta is the current one i meant
29-10-2020T21:57:03,NezumiYuki,Nah Muon... we're soon gonna have Eta
29-10-2020T21:57:08,CrRAR,Zeta is nor the end of the greek alphabet xD
29-10-2020T21:57:12,MuonNeutrino,"unless zeta is gone now, i haven't checked in a couple days"

29-10-2020T21:59:18,SageSaga,think about it- if its not a surprise- then they KNOW ITS INCEST
29-10-2020T21:59:22,NezumiYuki,"Not to make anyone nervous but... just think... if we ever see a season where we actually name a hurricane,  Hurricane Omega~   that'd have been a bad year!"
29-10-2020T21:59:35,MuonNeutrino,i wonder what they'd do if they actually ran out of the greek alphabet XD
29-10-2020T21:59:49,MuonNeutrino,like what do you name the one AFTER omega?>
29-10-2020T21:59:57,CrRAR,Double name everything
29-10-2020T22:00:13,MuonNeutrino,or do what xkcd suggested and just start randomly picking words from the dictionary >.>
29-10-2020T22:00:17,Dadrobit,"Also, I mean... ""Uncle/Auntie"" parents are pretty common no? Even I have asSister in law that's ""Auntie"" to her firstborn."
29-10-2020T22:00:22,MuonNeutrino,i think 'hurricane eggbeater' has a nice ring to it
29-10-2020T22:00:25,CrRAR,lol
29-10-2020T22:00:32,Dadrobit,a sister*

29-10-2020T22:01:22,Nekonny,Ive been at my job for 10 years and I swear I make less than I did when I started
29-10-2020T22:01:25,Dadrobit,"Anywho, time for work for me, o7"
29-10-2020T22:01:32,Ordithus,work work dad
29-10-2020T22:01:36,NezumiYuki,Take care Dadro
29-10-2020T22:01:36,MuonNeutrino,i like how rose goes from 'stinkin ADORBS' to 'misbehaving is what i do' in two years >.>
29-10-2020T22:01:37,CrRAR,See ya!
29-10-2020T22:01:40,KeefMcDerpface,bye Dad
29-10-2020T22:01:45,TheSexyBeast,Use discarded English alphabet letters
29-10-2020T22:01:45,SageSaga,Ron- you should know for sure if thats true or not
29-10-2020T22:01:53,MuonNeutrino,cause you can't tell me the version of rose in the middle there isn't in trouble ALL THE TIME
29-10-2020T22:01:59,CrRAR,"yus, she’s quite rough and tumble"
29-10-2020T22:02:02,Ordithus,"if inflation is faster, you are making less! :ctwokinds-keith8D:"
29-10-2020T22:02:07,CrRAR,^
29-10-2020T22:02:32,NezumiYuki,I would love to meet up with Pre-Teen Adventurous Rose!
29-10-2020T22:02:56,NezumiYuki,"Tree climbing be fun, Yo!"
29-10-2020T22:03:02,SageSaga,inflation from 10 years ago is 19 cents
29-10-2020T22:03:03,MuonNeutrino,pre-teen adventurous rose is the kind of playmate who would be super fun all the time until you inevitably end up grounded at the end of the day XD
29-10-2020T22:03:23,CrRAR,Rose: she’s got bark and bite and that’s just talking about her attitude!
29-10-2020T22:03:24,MuonNeutrino,after she dares you to do something incredibly dumb >.>
29-10-2020T22:03:42,Nekonny,19 cents?
29-10-2020T22:03:46,Nekonny,per dollar?
29-10-2020T22:03:51,SageSaga,yep
29-10-2020T22:03:57,Nekonny,so $20
29-10-2020T22:03:58,TheSexyBeast,..wander into a human settlement?
29-10-2020T22:04:02,Nekonny,%20
29-10-2020T22:04:29,NezumiYuki,wander into the human settlement IN JUST YOUR FUR!
29-10-2020T22:04:39,Nekonny,hummm
29-10-2020T22:04:46,MuonNeutrino,"well, iirc she had an illusion on at first"
29-10-2020T22:04:53,Nekonny,iit feells like a lot more
29-10-2020T22:04:58,Nekonny,my HOA has doubled
29-10-2020T22:05:10,CrRAR,ugh
29-10-2020T22:05:14,Nekonny,health insurence has gone up way more than 20%
29-10-2020T22:05:19,Ordithus,"some prices have risen faster than inflation, yeah"
29-10-2020T22:05:29,SageSaga,HOA doesnt count as inflation nor does insurance
29-10-2020T22:05:34,Nekonny,I thought that was the base for inflation cost
29-10-2020T22:05:39,TheSexyBeast,Didn't Rose carry a knife too?
29-10-2020T22:05:42,Nekonny,its inflation to me
29-10-2020T22:05:43,SageSaga,Why?
29-10-2020T22:05:52,Nekonny,becaus emy money is worth less
29-10-2020T22:05:53,SageSaga,thats not how economics works
29-10-2020T22:06:12,MuonNeutrino,rose had a knife the time we saw her with euchre at the start of the flashback
29-10-2020T22:06:18,Ordithus,where did she hide that knife
29-10-2020T22:06:19,Nekonny,Ronomics
29-10-2020T22:06:20,MuonNeutrino,i don't think we've seen her with any sort of weapon other times
29-10-2020T22:06:23,Dragusthor,si
29-10-2020T22:06:26,Nekonny,Ronconomics
29-10-2020T22:06:29,SageSaga,No Ron... no
29-10-2020T22:06:42,NezumiYuki,However~   Teen or Young Adult Rose...  gosh I'd have LOVED to have gotten together with her! <3
29-10-2020T22:06:43,MuonNeutrino,"that's the cost of living going up, not inflation XD"
29-10-2020T22:06:49,Nekonny,welll
29-10-2020T22:07:00,Nekonny,what is inflation
29-10-2020T22:07:22,Nekonny,cost of living going up is a side effect of inflation
29-10-2020T22:07:25,TheSexyBeast,Soon living is going to be too expensive..
29-10-2020T22:07:32,MuonNeutrino,i guess it depends which markers in the economy actually are technically used to decide 'inflation'
29-10-2020T22:07:36,CrRAR,Yeah ron
29-10-2020T22:07:37,SageSaga,inflation is the buying power of the dollar
29-10-2020T22:07:38,Nekonny,you havent seen the cost of dying
29-10-2020T22:07:40,Ordithus,inflation is when you stick a bunch of air into a balloon
29-10-2020T22:07:48,CrRAR,lol
29-10-2020T22:07:53,Dragusthor,how many years can keidran live or depending on what race?
29-10-2020T22:07:55,KeefMcDerpface,hah
29-10-2020T22:08:01,Nekonny,"My buck won't buy as much power/water, etc"
29-10-2020T22:08:05,MuonNeutrino,"early to mid 20s, it seems"
29-10-2020T22:08:13,MuonNeutrino,though there does seem to be some variation
29-10-2020T22:08:42,NezumiYuki,Inflation is when you put 28-PSIG in the front tires of your Honda Accord
29-10-2020T22:08:45,TheSexyBeast,"Cost of dying is just a funeral and disposal of the remains, a fixed price."
29-10-2020T22:08:52,SageSaga,in the 1930s you could buy a whole candy bar for a Nickel
29-10-2020T22:09:07,hyneria,Do more NSFW works. Your YCH's sold so well I could even get one
29-10-2020T22:09:09,SageSaga,not because candy was cheap back then - but the value of the dollar was higher
29-10-2020T22:09:14,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Inflation is  [Redacted]
29-10-2020T22:09:25,SageSaga,that same candy bar today costs about a dollar
29-10-2020T22:09:42,Nekonny,I have been at this job a week shy of 11 years
29-10-2020T22:09:42,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rose: Rose is so cute <3
29-10-2020T22:09:44,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,:ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:
29-10-2020T22:09:44,SageSaga,its the same candy- and in a way- the same price
29-10-2020T22:09:44,Dragusthor,"I did not know, I did not know it"
29-10-2020T22:10:08,NezumiYuki,"LOL Deathclaw... Let's not get into the Furry Fandom's definition of ""Inflation""  shall we?   Tom and Sage's streams are safe for the workplace... well mostly..."
29-10-2020T22:10:11,TheSexyBeast,"""Gimme five bees for a quarter!"""
29-10-2020T22:10:13,CrRAR,Yeah the dollar in relation has changed value
29-10-2020T22:10:30,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,that's why I said [redacted]
29-10-2020T22:10:35,CrRAR,Like when more get printed you dilute value
29-10-2020T22:10:42,NezumiYuki,Ahh mkay!
29-10-2020T22:11:30,CrRAR,Value of labor has dropped since like the 70’s pretty steadily
29-10-2020T22:11:33,NezumiYuki,LOL getting silly for just one moment~   I can think of a certain Tiger who would love some inflation in certain areas.  XDD
29-10-2020T22:11:41,CrRAR,lol
29-10-2020T22:11:49,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:

29-10-2020T22:12:03,KeefMcDerpface,pffft
29-10-2020T22:12:14,TheSexyBeast,Wrong emoji
29-10-2020T22:12:15,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-florajiggle:
29-10-2020T22:12:16,Nekonny,candy was cheap back then because the cost to make it was less
29-10-2020T22:12:28,SageSaga,not totally true Ron
29-10-2020T22:12:35,TheSexyBeast,Ord got it. 👍
29-10-2020T22:12:46,SageSaga,that cost also seemed less because again- the value of the dollar was lower
29-10-2020T22:12:51,Nekonny,I lived under hyperinflation
29-10-2020T22:12:52,SageSaga,*higher
29-10-2020T22:13:06,SageSaga,not all inflation is bad
29-10-2020T22:13:13,CrRAR,Economies of scale make things cheaper to produce typically
29-10-2020T22:13:14,NezumiYuki,^
29-10-2020T22:13:17,MuonNeutrino,"so on a different topic, i came in halfway through, did tom just decide to make this or was there a card or something"
29-10-2020T22:13:52,Ordithus,dunno
29-10-2020T22:13:57,CrRAR,^
29-10-2020T22:14:00,KeefMcDerpface,^
29-10-2020T22:14:10,MuonNeutrino,"cause i am most DEFINITELY not complaining either way, but i'm curious heh"
29-10-2020T22:14:23,SageSaga,the example and number i gave you was based solely on inflation
29-10-2020T22:14:35,Twokinds,nora card
29-10-2020T22:14:39,MuonNeutrino,neat
29-10-2020T22:14:41,KeefMcDerpface,ah
29-10-2020T22:14:45,CrRAR,yay
29-10-2020T22:15:01,CrRAR,You could say interest in Rose is in bloom these days
29-10-2020T22:15:06,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-rose:
29-10-2020T22:15:10,KeefMcDerpface,hehe
29-10-2020T22:15:20,NezumiYuki,Speaking of which... Has Tom ever made a Nora Card - growing up - Natani before?   Memory fails me.....
29-10-2020T22:15:41,MuonNeutrino,as in an age chart for natani? no
29-10-2020T22:15:46,SageSaga,there's a reason back in the 30s you can pay a kid for over an hour of work with a single coin like a quarter or half dollar
29-10-2020T22:15:51,KeefMcDerpface,I don't think there's one for Natani in the first place.
29-10-2020T22:15:57,SageSaga,and it wasnt due to child labor laws XD
29-10-2020T22:16:20,CrRAR,nerp
29-10-2020T22:16:30,SageSaga,in todays currency a quarter would be worth 3.90
29-10-2020T22:16:53,TheSexyBeast,I'm now getting Dick Tracy movie flashbacks...
29-10-2020T22:17:06,Ordithus,heh this reminds me of the Futurama episode when Fry discovers his old bank account
29-10-2020T22:17:13,SageSaga,exactly
29-10-2020T22:17:32,CrRAR,Yeah then there’s the whole phenomenon of prices of things outpacing inflation
29-10-2020T22:17:37,SageSaga,you give a kid a half dollar coin for a job back then your paying them more than the current minimum wage
29-10-2020T22:17:46,CrRAR,"Like housing, school, transportation etc"
29-10-2020T22:18:08,CrRAR,Really driven by demand and greed
29-10-2020T22:18:19,Nekonny,and gold was $35 an ounce
29-10-2020T22:18:21,CrRAR,...and easy to acquire debt
29-10-2020T22:18:42,Nekonny,man
29-10-2020T22:18:44,Nekonny,dick tracy
29-10-2020T22:18:58,Nekonny,I don't think I ever actually watched thta movie
29-10-2020T22:19:15,TheSexyBeast,It's a hoot
29-10-2020T22:19:22,NezumiYuki,oh what? the madonna one?
29-10-2020T22:19:29,FenceEqualizer,Are we getting nostalgic in here?
29-10-2020T22:19:30,NezumiYuki,yeah it's heckin good!  xD
29-10-2020T22:19:32,TheSexyBeast,Yup
29-10-2020T22:19:34,CrRAR,Cheap debt is bad for the overall price of things because it give people easily accessible money meaning things need to get more expensive to maintain supply scarcity
29-10-2020T22:19:53,MuonNeutrino,i wonder which ages these two new added stages are
29-10-2020T22:20:09,SageSaga,i'd be a rich man if my patreon was in 1930s dollars XD
29-10-2020T22:20:16,CrRAR,lol
29-10-2020T22:20:20,CrRAR,tru
29-10-2020T22:20:29,MuonNeutrino,i'll guess..... 3 and 18?
29-10-2020T22:20:50,FenceEqualizer,Getting a burger and fries for a $1.50
29-10-2020T22:20:57,NezumiYuki,"On a similar note, Sage, a simple 20 buck quick art commission... That's something to actually get by on!"
29-10-2020T22:21:18,CrRAR,The oolder one added is probably sometime around TDM age maybe a little older?
29-10-2020T22:21:25,TheSexyBeast,Looks like the fight is gone from her in #5
29-10-2020T22:21:28,Ordithus,TDM Rose <3 :ctwokinds-rose:
29-10-2020T22:21:35,CrRAR,yusss
29-10-2020T22:21:35,MuonNeutrino,"it looks TDM-ish, yeah, and iirc she would have been 21 or something then"
29-10-2020T22:21:51,neropan,allo :ptv-greetings:
29-10-2020T22:21:55,KeefMcDerpface,hello nero
29-10-2020T22:21:57,Ordithus,hi nero
29-10-2020T22:22:01,NezumiYuki,Hi nero
29-10-2020T22:22:03,FenceEqualizer,Hiya Nero
29-10-2020T22:22:05,CrRAR,She seems to have mellowed out a little
29-10-2020T22:22:18,Dragusthor,I wanted to see a while. I have to do something tomorrow see you all good night and this very good tom
29-10-2020T22:22:19,SageSaga,my current patreon money in that time period would be similar to 12k per month
29-10-2020T22:22:27,TheSexyBeast,hey nero
29-10-2020T22:22:28,CrRAR,Wow
29-10-2020T22:22:30,Dragusthor,bye:dragon:
29-10-2020T22:22:31,Ordithus,night drag
29-10-2020T22:22:31,NezumiYuki,Rose mellow out?  Is that even possible?
29-10-2020T22:22:39,FenceEqualizer,Night drag
29-10-2020T22:22:46,KeefMcDerpface,night Drag
29-10-2020T22:22:46,CrRAR,Maybe just... hid it better?
29-10-2020T22:22:48,SageSaga,but we have 1458% inflation since then so - nope XD
29-10-2020T22:22:50,Ordithus,time travel sage
29-10-2020T22:22:54,TheSexyBeast,Nite
29-10-2020T22:23:09,Nekonny,oh well
29-10-2020T22:23:09,CrRAR,Had to be human-proper I guess
29-10-2020T22:23:19,Nekonny,I do worry sometimes
29-10-2020T22:23:32,SageSaga,if i could time travel i would probably just rob a bank of gold and bring it back to the current time period XD
29-10-2020T22:23:34,Nekonny,I guess I'm ok financially
29-10-2020T22:23:46,Nekonny,sage: butcoin
29-10-2020T22:23:47,MuonNeutrino,if i could time travel i'd buy certain stocks >.>
29-10-2020T22:23:51,CrRAR,lol
29-10-2020T22:23:56,TheSexyBeast,Time paradox
29-10-2020T22:23:56,Ordithus,"oooh good strategy, beyond the statute of limitations"
29-10-2020T22:23:57,CrRAR,Yus all the buttcoins
29-10-2020T22:23:57,MuonNeutrino,or yeah bitcoin heh
29-10-2020T22:24:01,FenceEqualizer,Forget that. Just look up all the winning lotteries in the future
29-10-2020T22:24:13,Nekonny,just one would be enough fence
29-10-2020T22:24:19,FenceEqualizer,Or tell your past self about bitcoin
29-10-2020T22:24:26,MuonNeutrino,"eh, lotto is one of those things where i'd be concerned about the butterfly effect"
29-10-2020T22:24:38,Kynum,sup
29-10-2020T22:24:42,MuonNeutrino,larger scale trends like 'certain tech company stocks are good' would be more resilient to that
29-10-2020T22:24:45,CrRAR,Ello kynum
29-10-2020T22:24:46,KeefMcDerpface,hello Kynum
29-10-2020T22:25:01,SageSaga,bit coin and when to get out - but that involves changing your personal past
29-10-2020T22:25:06,SageSaga,and that sounds dangerous
29-10-2020T22:25:25,FenceEqualizer,Hi Kynum. Also true
29-10-2020T22:25:31,SageSaga,its best to mess with something far enough back that you dont screw yourself
29-10-2020T22:25:41,Ordithus,"if you got in early enough, it'd still be worth a lot today"
29-10-2020T22:25:48,MuonNeutrino,"eh, the farther back you go the more likely you are to have changes ripple forward to affect you"
29-10-2020T22:25:54,Ordithus,even though it's below the peak
29-10-2020T22:26:45,SageSaga,yeah but the you who bought in with your info would probably panic sell or sell anyways at that time regardless
29-10-2020T22:26:59,MuonNeutrino,"tho i read an interesting idea recently that proposes that if you go back in time, no matter what you do you won't end up actually changing anything, because the universe will find a way to twist events around so that your own past history is still valid"
29-10-2020T22:27:05,SageSaga,trying to convince my much poorer self not to become a millionaire right away would be so hard
29-10-2020T22:27:17,CrRAR,Yeah there were a lot of peaks that SEEMED huge at the time
29-10-2020T22:27:34,Ordithus,"shh, just be patient, it will be worth tens of thousands instead of millions!"
29-10-2020T22:27:43,FenceEqualizer,Threaten to break your past self car every time you remember your past self being a jerk
29-10-2020T22:28:00,SageSaga,i already got rid of my car-
29-10-2020T22:28:18,FenceEqualizer,Steal past self toilet paper then
29-10-2020T22:28:21,SageSaga,so if i tried doing that to my old self then i might not ever get rid of it and change my own future
29-10-2020T22:28:50,aeoronwah,HIHI
29-10-2020T22:28:53,Nekonny,lets see
29-10-2020T22:29:08,Nekonny,go to some market in china and stop a guy from eating a bat

29-10-2020T22:34:52,earthkung121,Oh phasmophobia
29-10-2020T22:35:08,aeoronwah,it's an easy game to dump thousands of hours into without feeling like you got anything done at all
29-10-2020T22:35:12,SageSaga,its not the same thing
29-10-2020T22:35:38,Nekonny,I mean
29-10-2020T22:35:50,Nekonny,a short game with a smaller group?

29-10-2020T22:36:28,SageSaga,the whole reason we cant play is we are short players for the night-
29-10-2020T22:36:35,FenceEqualizer,Everytime I see these age charts it makes me think “man it would suck to date a keidran” your time together would get cut so fast as things are starting to move.
29-10-2020T22:37:00,SageSaga,how am I supposed to randomly get a new group of people to play with?
29-10-2020T22:37:34,SageSaga,much less a group of people last minute
29-10-2020T22:37:50,SageSaga,then theres the process of making the game
29-10-2020T22:37:58,SageSaga,coming up with a story or a campaign to use
29-10-2020T22:38:38,FenceEqualizer,A.I dungeon multiplayer a campaign /joke

29-10-2020T22:57:37,ZRO4825,"Like, around 80~100ish range, iirc"
29-10-2020T22:57:41,NezumiYuki,"multiply 30 by four, Toon.. At least I recon it's a four to one ratio"
29-10-2020T22:57:44,FenceEqualizer,The 80s/90s where weird
29-10-2020T22:57:55,ZRO4825,"Oy, I represent that comment, tyvm."

29-10-2020T23:01:34,neropan,nini ron o/
29-10-2020T23:01:40,Nekonny,:0
29-10-2020T23:01:40,MuonNeutrino,"in a previous sketch, 8 is given as the age of adulthood for keidran, and 6 is essentially the start of adolescence"
29-10-2020T23:01:46,Twokinds,brb
29-10-2020T23:01:52,CrRAR,ok
29-10-2020T23:01:55,KeefMcDerpface,ok
29-10-2020T23:02:25,MuonNeutrino,"but that doesn't mean that there's a simple ratio, because those are barely 2:1"
29-10-2020T23:02:27,FenceEqualizer,“And some say That was the last they saw of Tom”
29-10-2020T23:02:28,AspiringNoodle,night ron
29-10-2020T23:02:41,MuonNeutrino,which isn't consistent with the 20s being end-of-life type ages
29-10-2020T23:02:51,MuonNeutrino,so it's not a constant ratio throughout their lives
29-10-2020T23:03:39,Ordithus,"just like with dogs, cats, anything."
29-10-2020T23:03:45,SpazztasticKiwi,what in the Cindy Lou Who is that hairdo
29-10-2020T23:04:20,KeefMcDerpface,Something Rose's parents thought was cute.

29-10-2020T23:09:30,Twokinds,The ages don't scale linearly. It speeds up and slows down compared to humans at various points
29-10-2020T23:09:38,Twokinds,I'm back

29-10-2020T23:16:36,Kynum,Please stand by
29-10-2020T23:16:48,Twokinds,Maybe they latch onto the tail strap
29-10-2020T23:16:55,FenceEqualizer,Just go the home improvement route and always have something obscureing magpies back

29-10-2020T23:18:29,KeefMcDerpface,hello Raptor
29-10-2020T23:18:31,FenceEqualizer,Hiya Raptor
29-10-2020T23:18:42,TheSexyBeast,o/ rap
29-10-2020T23:19:42,Zakuru,nvm i got it
29-10-2020T23:19:44,TheSexyBeast,Rose was just going through a rebellious 'no clothes' phase
29-10-2020T23:20:04,CrRAR,ok
29-10-2020T23:20:07,NezumiYuki,Why would we keidran need clothes anyway?  We have FUR!
29-10-2020T23:20:07,CrRAR,lol
29-10-2020T23:20:20,ZRO4825,I wish more sexy women would go through rebellious 'no clothes' phases.
29-10-2020T23:20:27,Zakuru,"i couldnt find the original so i was only going off of the sunday sketches/colors, where tom changed it to have her back open"
29-10-2020T23:20:39,FenceEqualizer,Random question Tom how was Rose and Traces relationship after Saria’s death? I mean she ended up staying at the mansion
29-10-2020T23:20:43,Zakuru,so now everything is confusing
29-10-2020T23:20:47,Succubutt,:eyes:
29-10-2020T23:20:55,Ordithus,lol zro
29-10-2020T23:20:57,Twokinds,tense

29-10-2020T23:22:09,CrRAR,"2nd is normal sized, dunno about dat first one"
29-10-2020T23:22:09,TheSexyBeast,"We Keidran don't need clothes, save for satisfying others' modesty."
29-10-2020T23:22:17,FenceEqualizer,Just a life of tension. That can’t be fun. Figure Trace must have found some sort of kinship with her
29-10-2020T23:22:33,FenceEqualizer,Cause she was allowed to stay after all that happen
29-10-2020T23:22:53,SageSaga,that is not normal size
29-10-2020T23:23:06,Zakuru,it isnt lol
29-10-2020T23:23:06,SageSaga,that has horrible jpg artifacts
29-10-2020T23:23:08,CrRAR,I know tiny by today standards

29-10-2020T23:24:25,Ordithus,it's the same link but with the _d deleted
29-10-2020T23:24:28,CrRAR,Yup
29-10-2020T23:24:44,FenceEqualizer,Wait that doesn’t look so complicated
29-10-2020T23:25:39,CrRAR,Yeah for some reason my copies of the link came w/ the modifier
29-10-2020T23:25:48,FenceEqualizer,I mean it’s not the most practical of clothing but I can’t see it being hard to imagine seeing the back side
29-10-2020T23:26:33,Ordithus,":eyes: more friends, sage?"
29-10-2020T23:26:33,Nocturn3,I really like how your doing the hair here nero!

29-10-2020T23:40:37,NezumiYuki,"This gets me thinking... If Rose had gone through the ""Don't need clothes"" phase, and so did Flora, then why didn't Natani?   xDD"
29-10-2020T23:40:56,Ordithus,secrets

29-10-2020T23:41:15,Twokinds,Keidran don't generally wear clothes
29-10-2020T23:41:38,NezumiYuki,"Ah so like the Pones... ""We don't normally wear clothes...""   Gotcha"
29-10-2020T23:42:02,Vexd,Clothes are for if you're gonna interact with humans
29-10-2020T23:42:08,Vexd,And even that's a suggestion
29-10-2020T23:42:18,Sergei92,What sketches were there before? I was just sleeping ...

29-10-2020T23:46:17,NezumiYuki,"I still have to finish my Maeve fanart, but I suddenly want to draw some Halloween Witch Mrs Nibbly... and I don't understand why?!"
29-10-2020T23:46:23,Sergei92,I wish the same from Europe
29-10-2020T23:47:02,NezumiYuki,The thought just poped into my head... Nibbly Witch... do it now!
29-10-2020T23:47:14,CrRAR,Like lil Nibbly with witchy accessories?
29-10-2020T23:47:33,CrRAR,or anthro?

29-10-2020T23:49:57,AspiringNoodle,Something nutty
29-10-2020T23:50:00,KeefMcDerpface,lol

29-10-2020T23:53:56,NezumiYuki,Not only that but a blue moon for October too
29-10-2020T23:54:06,AspiringNoodle,Maybe something spoopy will happen
29-10-2020T23:54:17,AspiringNoodle,Something so spoopy that I lose my appetite and save on food bills xD
29-10-2020T23:54:24,Rainelover,Which is the first time since 1945
29-10-2020T23:54:30,KeefMcDerpface,"Keith: ""Nat, why are you howling at a pumpkin?"""

29-10-2020T23:55:14,SageSaga,it is both a blue moon and a hunter's moon
29-10-2020T23:55:40,Rainelover,And a micro moon
29-10-2020T23:55:51,CrRAR,These circumstances~

29-10-2020T23:56:33,NezumiYuki,It's a wolf's moon... Just ask Natani!
29-10-2020T23:57:02,Nocturn3,I got it like an 8th of the way on my screen but the details amazing!
29-10-2020T23:57:04,SageSaga,and all of this-  means nothing because moon phases dont do anything particularly special that affects most of us
29-10-2020T23:57:06,KeefMcDerpface,Can't now. He's howling at a pumpkin atm.
29-10-2020T23:57:07,Ordithus,many moons
29-10-2020T23:57:07,NezumiYuki,Clovis:  Why do I have the sudden urge to howl?!
