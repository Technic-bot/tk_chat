11-11-2020T00:13:40,SpazztasticKiwi,you know I question what would happen if there was a magic mirror in the mansion
11-11-2020T00:14:01,SpazztasticKiwi,you look in it and your evil self steps out
11-11-2020T00:14:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"or if a good version appears, you‚Äôre the evil one"
11-11-2020T00:14:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Nibbly looks in it and nothing changes
11-11-2020T00:14:54,SpazztasticKiwi,which is comforting and concerning
11-11-2020T00:16:30,Ordithus,"remember, our Kat is the evil Kat"
11-11-2020T00:23:49,Snowmanwizard,:ctwokinds-daydreamingkat: evil?
11-11-2020T00:24:54,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Pure evil
11-11-2020T00:34:22,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-KatDance: look how evil
11-11-2020T00:47:57,Snowmanwizard,"your right, very evil"
11-11-2020T00:49:27,Sesarag,"Hi, How is everyone doin> <3"
11-11-2020T00:49:58,AspiringNoodle,"Universe trying to tell Noodle something, not sure what though :snake:"
11-11-2020T00:50:12,Sesarag,Hmm..
11-11-2020T00:51:06,AspiringNoodle,"2 days ago, got a prospective job offer for a temp gig.  Though I'd need to learn SAP, and I don't think this is for entry-level experience."
11-11-2020T00:51:27,AspiringNoodle,"Today, wow'd a region manager for Pilot.  She gave me her business card."
11-11-2020T00:51:42,AspiringNoodle,It's definitely trying to tell me SOMETHING...
11-11-2020T00:53:39,Sesarag,Interesting week you had I see
11-11-2020T00:58:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm watching a short clip of all the presidents throwing the famous first pitch
11-11-2020T00:58:54,SpazztasticKiwi,was harry truman left handed

11-11-2020T01:17:47,AspiringNoodle,You rise to the level of your incompetence
11-11-2020T01:18:02,AspiringNoodle,INCOMPETENCE SIGHTED.
11-11-2020T01:26:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom did you go to tongin market when you went to Korea
11-11-2020T01:33:48,SpazztasticKiwi,the grease is Real but it looks so good ü§§
11-11-2020T01:52:30,Twokinds,I've been so some alley markets in Korea
11-11-2020T01:52:38,Twokinds,I don't know if I've been to that one specifically
11-11-2020T02:12:13,SpazztasticKiwi,$5 for a ring of 10 coins that you use to fill a plate from a whole marketplace of stalls sort of place
11-11-2020T02:14:28,SpazztasticKiwi,there‚Äôs that one specifically but Mike Chen‚Äôs been to enough street markets& restaurants in Seoul I‚Äôm convinced he‚Äôs got to have been to them all by now & it‚Äôs hard to tell which is which
11-11-2020T02:14:42,Twokinds,"Aah, that sounds neat. Never done that"
11-11-2020T02:16:24,Sesarag,Wew
11-11-2020T02:17:58,SpazztasticKiwi,he showed something that looked like fried hot cheetos he said was fried rice sticks & ‚Äúkimbab‚Äù
11-11-2020T02:18:33,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs hard to follow sometimes because there‚Äôs not always translations & he talks fast
11-11-2020T02:18:40,SpazztasticKiwi,and with his mouth full half the time
11-11-2020T02:19:38,Sesarag,"haha, yes"
11-11-2020T02:20:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"tongin market, 18 jahamun-ro 15-gil, tongin-dong, jongno-gu, Seoul SK"
11-11-2020T02:21:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm taking a guess that‚Äôs the address because it‚Äôs under ‚Äúlocation‚Äù in the description
11-11-2020T02:22:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll pass on the octopus skewers
11-11-2020T02:22:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I like my food unmoving
11-11-2020T02:23:04,Sesarag,sameee
11-11-2020T02:24:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"he also went to a kfc that had a chicken sandwich with cheese, bacon, and hash browns where the buns were chicken"
11-11-2020T02:25:42,SpazztasticKiwi,that last market looked good until I saw that whole cooked duck‚Äôs head - my appetite flew south
11-11-2020T02:45:01,Sesarag,Duck head???
11-11-2020T02:45:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn‚Äôt stutter
11-11-2020T02:49:46,Sesarag,Dude seems like he doesn't mind anything for an appetite.
11-11-2020T03:07:19,SpazztasticKiwi,dude says his favorite parts of Korean places are the cow intestine soup and beef and pork innards places
11-11-2020T03:07:41,SpazztasticKiwi,with all he eats and how much he should be 300 pounds

11-11-2020T15:51:29,CrRAR,Oh yeah that alley is the worst
11-11-2020T15:51:32,CrimsonQuill,Heroic coop should be a breeze
11-11-2020T15:51:50,CrRAR,Halo 3 brought those back with a vengence in the jungle xD
11-11-2020T15:52:03,CrimsonQuill,Dear God...those damned Jackals...
11-11-2020T15:52:33,CrimsonQuill,The only things I hate more than them are the Yan'me (The 'Buggers')
11-11-2020T15:52:34,CrRAR,Is it the Anniversary Edition? Did they keep the skulls in the remake version?
11-11-2020T15:52:43,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, yes, and add some more too!"
11-11-2020T15:52:44,CrRAR,Oh yeah annoying buzzers
11-11-2020T15:52:52,CrRAR,Oh really? Cool
11-11-2020T15:53:06,CrRAR,Yeah in Halo 2 it was weird because they were kinda unofficial
11-11-2020T15:53:34,CrRAR,"They were just there, no menu activation or ‚Äúcollectable‚Äùness to em"
11-11-2020T15:53:49,CrRAR,Just did horrible horrible things most times
11-11-2020T15:53:57,CrRAR,Like the Blind skull xD

11-11-2020T15:54:29,CrimsonQuill,Legendary is good enough for me
11-11-2020T15:55:55,CrRAR,yup
11-11-2020T15:56:36,AspiringNoodle,Y'all should try beating the original Conduit game on the hardest difficulty xD

11-11-2020T15:57:08,AspiringNoodle,The Jefferson Memorial in particular is fun

11-11-2020T15:57:30,CrimsonQuill,Discworld reference
11-11-2020T15:57:31,CrimsonQuill,!
11-11-2020T15:57:32,AspiringNoodle,You need to destroy 3 portals that will endlessly summon enemies and clear up all the mobs
11-11-2020T15:58:02,AspiringNoodle,"The problem is that the grunts in that game have a charging rifle that does high damage at full charge, and a headshot from the AI is an instant kill"
11-11-2020T15:58:13,AspiringNoodle,Add in motion controls for extra fun <3
11-11-2020T16:13:02,AspiringNoodle,Man... that restart feature sure is nifty

11-11-2020T16:15:27,AspiringNoodle,oh no
11-11-2020T16:31:07,CrRAR,Very quik combustion
11-11-2020T16:31:15,CrRAR,munches cheezits
11-11-2020T16:31:31,CrRAR,Especially if it‚Äôs quite dry.

11-11-2020T16:41:53,SpazztasticKiwi,is a swimming pool human soup
11-11-2020T16:42:23,CrRAR,not enough seasoning
11-11-2020T16:42:39,Dadrobit,hot tubs are. 'specially for the poor folks who have a heart attack in one and aren't found for a week...
11-11-2020T16:42:42,SpazztasticKiwi,chewy too
11-11-2020T16:42:57,CrRAR,tru
11-11-2020T16:43:01,SpazztasticKiwi,and I thought my two cents was disturbing

11-11-2020T16:43:47,SpazztasticKiwi,oh but that reminds me of someone I know that died...
11-11-2020T16:43:54,Dadrobit,"Consider it an investment, you put in 2 cents and got way more than you bargained for."
11-11-2020T16:44:21,SpazztasticKiwi,a distant cousin was found in his home a few weeks ago
11-11-2020T16:44:44,SpazztasticKiwi,he‚Äôd just learned his ex wife got remarried

11-11-2020T16:50:00,CrRAR,:v: terra
11-11-2020T16:52:25,CrRAR,What‚Äôs painful I guess is that much of people‚Äôs lives revolve around each other. It‚Äôs hard to cope with so much change when something like that happens.
11-11-2020T16:53:02,SpazztasticKiwi,they‚Äôd been apart for a bit already
11-11-2020T16:53:15,SpazztasticKiwi,their daughters are close to my age
11-11-2020T16:53:59,CrRAR,"Yeah, but obv he hadn‚Äôt gotten over it. ;_;"
11-11-2020T16:54:10,SpazztasticKiwi,nope
11-11-2020T16:54:23,CrRAR,That‚Äôs very tough
11-11-2020T16:54:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm pretty sure everybody knew he still loved her
11-11-2020T16:55:10,CrRAR,Did they just grow apart over time or something?
11-11-2020T16:55:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt know exactly
11-11-2020T16:55:55,CrRAR,"Ah, just sad."
11-11-2020T16:56:38,SpazztasticKiwi,it might‚Äôve been he drank a bit more than reasonable and she got fed up but I don‚Äôt put much trust in rumors
11-11-2020T16:56:51,CrRAR,"Relationships are a big investment, time and energy. Recreating it again can seem impossible... and daunting."
11-11-2020T16:57:03,Dadrobit,"Mmmm, that blows. Them having kids means it's really kinda impossible to truly get completely out of any relationship."
11-11-2020T16:57:15,CrRAR,yeah
11-11-2020T16:57:20,SpazztasticKiwi,their kids are grown
11-11-2020T16:57:53,SpazztasticKiwi,they separated when they were inches from grown
11-11-2020T16:58:43,SpazztasticKiwi,they visited their parents separately when they visited
11-11-2020T16:59:14,SpazztasticKiwi,could be they were in different towns but it‚Äôs not like they were hostile to each other
11-11-2020T17:00:43,SpazztasticKiwi,for better or worse they were just...apart
11-11-2020T17:01:22,CrRAR,"Dislike can often be just an unspoken thing. Like they say, when you STOP talking it‚Äôs over."
11-11-2020T17:02:25,SpazztasticKiwi,he did isolate from what I understand after but that could‚Äôve been not wanting to move on or not caring to if not both
11-11-2020T17:02:45,SpazztasticKiwi,could‚Äôve been mad if not only upset but he obviously got depressed
11-11-2020T17:04:40,CrRAR,To quote a certain Gordon Lightfoot song:
11-11-2020T17:04:46,CrRAR,:notes: I‚Äôm just trying to understand the feelings... that you lack :notes:
11-11-2020T17:05:18,CrRAR,His daughter supposedly later remarked that the lyric should have been ‚ÄúFeelings... that WE lack‚Äù
11-11-2020T17:05:49,CrRAR,Meaning missing his own shortfalls as it applied to their relationship.

11-11-2020T17:10:07,CrRAR,Yeah often it‚Äôs just unwillingness to acknoledge some personal issue.
11-11-2020T17:11:41,CrRAR,Relationships are constant mutual compromise

11-11-2020T20:29:34,AspiringNoodle,I remember in the final year we started writing in the same format as the Aeneid
11-11-2020T20:29:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I got all the Sanders ones

11-11-2020T22:17:38,Ordithus,my hair does that too. it's possessed if I let it get long
11-11-2020T22:28:50,AspiringNoodle,It takes 2 - 3 months for it to finally curl enough to poke myself
11-11-2020T22:29:11,AspiringNoodle,So at some point in the near future I will need to schedule an appointment to get it styled.
11-11-2020T22:29:56,AspiringNoodle,Gonna need a style that can go a long time without needing a trim.  I'm not putting my eggs in the vaccine basket
