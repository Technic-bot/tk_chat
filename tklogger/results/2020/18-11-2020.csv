18-11-2020T17:39:29,SpazztasticKiwi,is it bad that I actively have to remind myself that Robert Downey jr is still alive
18-11-2020T17:41:34,CrRAR,hmmm
18-11-2020T17:42:00,CrRAR,Are you somehow confusing him with Phillip Seymore Hoffman?
18-11-2020T17:42:43,CrRAR,or is it just all the perilous situations RDJ has been in as Tony?
18-11-2020T17:43:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I just remember how iron man died and there was the virtual and movie funeral for this guy with his face so my brain I guess is like ‚Äúhe died‚Äù
18-11-2020T17:44:29,SpazztasticKiwi,then I see him in the news or in another whatever & error404 pops up
18-11-2020T17:45:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"a celebrity was mourned but it was for a character that died due to cannon, not the sudden death of an actor"

18-11-2020T17:50:39,SpazztasticKiwi,but the problem is rdj is iron man
18-11-2020T17:50:57,CrimsonQuill,@SpazztasticKiwi I actually have that problem too.
18-11-2020T17:51:05,SpazztasticKiwi,for the longest time I was convinced his name was tony
18-11-2020T17:51:11,CrRAR,Yeah they make him incredibly real in some of the movie segments
18-11-2020T17:51:19,CrimsonQuill,I can't think of Robert Downey Jr. as being anyone other than Tony Stark...
18-11-2020T17:51:26,CrimsonQuill,It's like Ryan Reynolds and Deadpool.
18-11-2020T17:51:30,SpazztasticKiwi,no have you seen him in interviews
18-11-2020T17:51:37,CrimsonQuill,A few.
18-11-2020T17:51:40,SpazztasticKiwi,that‚Äôs tony stark
18-11-2020T17:51:50,CrRAR,"Especially in the bit of the movie when he ""mentors"" that kid"
18-11-2020T17:51:51,CrimsonQuill,They become one and the same...
18-11-2020T17:51:58,CrRAR,Oh yeah totally spazz
18-11-2020T17:52:02,SpazztasticKiwi,they somehow managed to legit find tony in real life

18-11-2020T17:52:23,CrRAR,That's really I think what sells it
18-11-2020T17:52:34,CrimsonQuill,People often say that Tony Stark is playing Robert Downey Jr.
18-11-2020T17:52:43,CrRAR,That he keeps it mostly the same
18-11-2020T17:53:22,CrRAR,"Hey, if it helps him keep up his spirits and a strong moral fiber, seems like it's working."
18-11-2020T17:54:14,CrRAR,He became iron man to become STRONG real-world character.
18-11-2020T17:55:26,CrRAR,"He had troubles in like the 90's with addiction n stuff, he's been rebuilt to the best version of himself."

18-11-2020T20:41:10,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs just saying it won‚Äôt start because there‚Äôs no gasket
18-11-2020T20:41:28,SpazztasticKiwi,far as I‚Äôm concerned that means it needs replacing
18-11-2020T20:41:44,CrRAR,A head gasket is basically the seal on the top of the engine block
18-11-2020T20:41:56,CrRAR,It prevents oil for spewing everywhere
18-11-2020T20:42:03,Ordithus,"If it won't start because of a head gasket, it's gone real bad."
18-11-2020T20:42:30,SpazztasticKiwi,the inside color scheme looked neat
18-11-2020T20:42:35,CrRAR,Ilke when you remove the ‚Äúhead‚Äù off the block you‚Äôre basiaclly staring at the bare pistions
18-11-2020T20:42:40,Ordithus,That kind of car is a mechanic's special - only a deal if you fix it yourself
18-11-2020T20:42:46,CrRAR,Think: Like a cake layer
18-11-2020T20:42:50,Ordithus,mmm cake
18-11-2020T20:42:53,Ordithus,give
18-11-2020T20:43:01,CrRAR,The head gasket seals in the delicious oil
18-11-2020T20:43:06,CrRAR,Like frosting
18-11-2020T20:43:43,CrRAR,Yeah w/o a gasket starting it would be disasterous
18-11-2020T20:43:56,SpazztasticKiwi,if it was a small fix I‚Äôd get it but all it‚Äôs got goin for it is a oragney on white inner scheme

18-11-2020T20:45:14,CrRAR,Yeah it‚Äôs a very simple like rubbery seal probably
18-11-2020T20:45:24,SpazztasticKiwi,but whatever it is to put it in
18-11-2020T20:46:00,SpazztasticKiwi,not listed
18-11-2020T20:46:18,CrRAR,I would just question WHY they needed to dig past the head gasket before.
18-11-2020T20:46:36,CrRAR,That‚Äôs not exactly weekend exploration work
18-11-2020T20:48:31,CrRAR,On old cars sometimes the gasket wears out and stsrts getting leaky.
18-11-2020T20:48:45,CrRAR,Like Subarus were notorious for that
18-11-2020T20:48:58,CrRAR,I think the 2011-2015ish models
18-11-2020T20:48:59,Ordithus,"and mercury sables, and dodge avengers (the old ones)"
