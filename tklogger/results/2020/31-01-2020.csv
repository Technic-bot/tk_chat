31-01-2020T03:29:55,AspiringNoodle,Or at least finish this part so when I wake up I just need to do the last bit
31-01-2020T03:30:14,AspiringNoodle,"Seriously, if you ever make a map that needs constant database updates, AUTOMATE IT XD"
31-01-2020T03:30:50,AspiringNoodle,"The app is so basic that for, gosh, I don't know how long I've been doing it for him, I spend 20 - 30 minutes sorting things into a format that's easier to read / keep track of"
31-01-2020T03:30:55,AspiringNoodle,1.5 hours creating new entries
31-01-2020T03:31:04,AspiringNoodle,and then 2 hours or so copying text over to the new entries
31-01-2020T03:31:15,AspiringNoodle,wash rinse repeat every time it needs an update (2x a month)
31-01-2020T03:31:23,AspiringNoodle,make an app*
31-01-2020T03:31:51,AspiringNoodle,"But what can I say, I like him, and there's potential opportunities~"

31-01-2020T03:38:11,JeremySenpai,Adjacent to what?
31-01-2020T03:39:10,AspiringNoodle,"It's very tedious and monotonous, requires a lot of clicks / button presses.  And I'm using multiple little shortcuts to speed things up.  I can only imagine how long it would take my boss to do this"

31-01-2020T03:44:26,AspiringNoodle,A lot of what I do is copy / paste

31-01-2020T03:47:45,JeremySenpai,Hoi bear
31-01-2020T03:48:08,AspiringNoodle,I'm not sure.  It's Google Firebase
31-01-2020T03:48:29,AspiringNoodle,"I dabbled in SQL for one class in college, but it was more on the theoretical level.  And I haven't gotten to see the guts of this app"
31-01-2020T03:48:44,AspiringNoodle,So I have no real grasp of the infrastructure

31-01-2020T16:01:05,SageSaga,we hit a snag while driving inside the airport- and we needed to take an elevator- so my brother and I got out and picked up the car  to try and angle it into the elevator
31-01-2020T16:01:25,SageSaga,somehow we got it in and then we had to get it back out
31-01-2020T16:01:53,SageSaga,"when security came to try to stop us- my dad yelled ""Get in the car! Were going to out run em!"""

31-01-2020T16:03:58,SageSaga,who says that?

31-01-2020T23:50:34,AspiringNoodle,I might draw tomorrow or sunday
31-01-2020T23:50:53,AspiringNoodle,"Finished most of my weekly stuff for WoW, gonna start reeling back what I do in that game on a daily basis :P"
31-01-2020T23:51:12,AspiringNoodle,Because effing hell has Blizzard made that game grindy af recently
31-01-2020T23:54:09,CrRAR,"That's really what Destiny was too under Blizzard... and while it's not entirely bad, Bungie broke free again because they want their games to be more than that."
31-01-2020T23:54:26,CrRAR,respecc
31-01-2020T23:54:35,AspiringNoodle,Shadowlands might fix that
31-01-2020T23:54:59,CrRAR,nice
31-01-2020T23:55:18,AspiringNoodle,"BLizzard is doing away with things like titanforging (neverending gear grind with a huge RNG element), expansion specific heirlooms, etc"
31-01-2020T23:55:45,CrRAR,"Maybe they just like to alternate, slow grindy for the lazy times till everyone gets tired of it and subs diminish."
31-01-2020T23:55:59,AspiringNoodle,"Right now they're testing a replacement for titanforging called corruption, but anyone who knows anything fucking hates it, because it's literally titanforging with 2 extra tiers of RNG"
31-01-2020T23:56:21,CrRAR,"ew, recycling"
31-01-2020T23:56:28,AspiringNoodle,"Too much RNG, too complex, and too many drawbacks"
31-01-2020T23:56:49,AspiringNoodle,1: You need the item to corrupt (aka titanforge and gain extra levels)
31-01-2020T23:57:06,AspiringNoodle,2: You need to get the proper corruption (5% leech vs 4% extra crit?  no brainer)
31-01-2020T23:58:33,CrRAR,lol it's like grinding... with extra steps!
31-01-2020T23:58:54,AspiringNoodle,"3: You need to get the proper tier of corruption (tier 1 is something like 5 - 10 corruption, tier 2 12 - 18, tier 3 25 - 30)"
31-01-2020T23:59:20,AspiringNoodle,4: You want it to roll as low as possible on the corruption tier
31-01-2020T23:59:58,AspiringNoodle,"And ideally, you want tier 2, because tier 3 gives way too much corruption for the effect it grants"
