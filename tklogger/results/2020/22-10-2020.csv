22-10-2020T20:05:38,Rainelover,Guten Abend everyone
22-10-2020T20:05:45,BadFoMo,Hi.
22-10-2020T20:06:29,Twokinds,I'm updating photoshop
22-10-2020T20:06:37,Twokinds,New version came out.
22-10-2020T20:06:48,BadFoMo,Cool.
22-10-2020T20:07:03,NezumiYuki,Sooooo... an hour long update... I take it?...   xD
22-10-2020T20:07:09,NezumiYuki,kidding kidding!
22-10-2020T20:07:14,Twokinds,Not sure yet. Currently saving all of my stuff just in case
22-10-2020T20:07:16,BadFoMo,...All your custom stuff still going to work?
22-10-2020T20:07:22,Twokinds,I don't trust software updates to remember all my settings.
22-10-2020T20:07:31,BadFoMo,Smart move.
22-10-2020T20:08:00,AspiringNoodle,"Always expect big companies to break things, and then take forever fixing them :ptv-laugh:"
22-10-2020T20:08:02,NezumiYuki,"wise move Tom, yeah we shouldn't either.  Saving your settings and custom add-ons before updating IS the way to go."
22-10-2020T20:08:23,AspiringNoodle,"Also always expect little companies to break things, but then bust their humps to fix them asap :ptv-uneasy:"
22-10-2020T20:09:11,BadFoMo,I think that's one of the reasons why my 'friend' /still/ uses Windows 7.
22-10-2020T20:09:27,Zakuru,harro
22-10-2020T20:09:33,AspiringNoodle,I was an early adopter of Windows 10.
22-10-2020T20:09:36,AspiringNoodle,Hiya Zak

22-10-2020T20:42:37,CrRAR,Photoshop updates are frequent and furious lately
22-10-2020T20:43:04,AspiringNoodle,"Photoshop: ""We need to go fast!"""

22-10-2020T20:44:21,ZRO4825,Never go plaid. Your laundry is never the same again.
22-10-2020T20:44:31,CrRAR,New Photoshop feature: Plaid
22-10-2020T20:44:52,NezumiYuki,Yeah but that's what Elon wants us to go.. He wants everyone to goto plaid!
22-10-2020T20:45:12,Twokinds,It works fine
22-10-2020T20:45:18,CrRAR,\o/
22-10-2020T20:45:19,NezumiYuki,Ah cool!
22-10-2020T20:45:21,Twokinds,Had a slight hickup importing brushes

22-10-2020T20:45:43,Twokinds,It said I had reached max number of brushes

22-10-2020T20:45:56,BadFoMo,****.
22-10-2020T20:45:59,CrRAR,Was there a ma brushes setting?
22-10-2020T20:46:03,CrRAR,*max
22-10-2020T20:46:04,Twokinds,But it was a bug where they multiplied all my brushes
22-10-2020T20:46:11,CrRAR,oh jeez
22-10-2020T20:46:14,NezumiYuki,O.o  Nan da?!
22-10-2020T20:46:16,Twokinds,"Er, dupped"
22-10-2020T20:46:30,AspiringNoodle,"Nonsense, they just made enough for each hand~"
22-10-2020T20:46:40,AspiringNoodle,"Double the brush, double the stroke, double the productivity?"
22-10-2020T20:47:04,BadFoMo,It /saved/ your settings and custom stuff?
22-10-2020T20:47:08,NezumiYuki,"wait... cloned brushes... Does this mean Flora gets to keep a ""Magic Pen"" of her very own, since it would appear to be Adobe's fault...    xD"
22-10-2020T20:47:10,BadFoMo,*?!
22-10-2020T20:47:24,ZRO4825,"Damn you, Sage. I'd finally gotten this tune out of my head..."
22-10-2020T20:48:41,SageSaga,its been in the list for months
22-10-2020T20:48:46,NezumiYuki,"wait so... should I tell Flora that she can have her very own ""Magic Pen"" or not?   I mean... we all know how much she would LOVE to have a magic pen of her very own...."
22-10-2020T20:48:53,ZRO4825,"Yeah, but I usually end up not hearing it, lol"
22-10-2020T20:49:33,Twokinds,One of the new features I'm most excited about is the new pattern maker assist
22-10-2020T20:50:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:eyes: pattern maker?
22-10-2020T20:50:09,NezumiYuki,"Oh that's sounds GOOD, Tom!   Could mean making your own cloud patterns or something, much easier!"
22-10-2020T20:50:24,Twokinds,It'll be good for textures
22-10-2020T20:50:27,SageSaga,that sounds interesting
22-10-2020T20:50:35,AspiringNoodle,Fluffy textures?
22-10-2020T20:50:47,NezumiYuki,oh shiiii... easier fur

22-10-2020T20:51:27,Twokinds,"er... well, I mean, I guess. I don't know if it'd be good for fur."
22-10-2020T20:51:41,Twokinds,"It'd be good for things like ground, rocks, wooden wall textures"
22-10-2020T20:51:42,Twokinds,etc
22-10-2020T20:51:50,Ordithus,noice

22-10-2020T20:52:11,NezumiYuki,"yeah not to down play it, but easier backgrounds IS a cool thing to have"
22-10-2020T20:52:19,K3IDRAN,Ight Tom
22-10-2020T20:52:33,Twokinds,It's a boring thing to be excited about
22-10-2020T20:52:41,SageSaga,no clue why people would assume its good for fur
22-10-2020T20:52:53,CrRAR,hopeful hopes
22-10-2020T20:52:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"If it makes life easier, then it's not boring"
22-10-2020T20:52:57,AspiringNoodle,Productivity is a great thing to be excited about :ptv-excited:

22-10-2020T21:28:02,BadFoMo,Cool!
22-10-2020T21:28:03,NezumiYuki,Photoshop takes a wide aspect image and turns it into a panorama image you can see in 360
22-10-2020T21:28:05,Twokinds,I literally painted it like this.
22-10-2020T21:28:07,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-excited:

22-10-2020T21:28:25,KeefMcDerpface,rip
22-10-2020T21:28:29,Ordithus,painted it flat? that had to be hard to visualize
22-10-2020T21:28:31,MoonDance,How bizzare- but nice
22-10-2020T21:28:32,jirka,But 360 degrees
22-10-2020T21:28:36,Twokinds,Yeah
22-10-2020T21:28:40,CrRAR,wood patterns :ok_hand:
22-10-2020T21:28:42,MuonNeutrino,huh. how'd you manage to get the lines all straight when you're looking up and down? i'd think it would be hard to keep things straight when looking at the most distorted parts
22-10-2020T21:28:42,Twokinds,It was incredibly hard around the edges
22-10-2020T21:28:45,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-GoogleyEmber:
22-10-2020T21:28:49,MoonDance,What got you into trying Panaromas?
22-10-2020T21:28:54,Ordithus,my mind is melting in sympathy
22-10-2020T21:28:57,BadFoMo,I could imagen.
22-10-2020T21:29:09,Twokinds,Like this chandelier is perfectly round in perspective
22-10-2020T21:29:13,Twokinds,But I had to paint it like this
22-10-2020T21:29:18,MuonNeutrino,yeow
22-10-2020T21:29:23,CrRAR,ovoid
22-10-2020T21:29:40,Twokinds,Floorboards were the hardest
22-10-2020T21:29:44,CrRAR,yeahh
22-10-2020T21:29:51,MuonNeutrino,so did you do a lot of trial and error painting things and then going and checking how they looked in the full surround?
22-10-2020T21:29:53,jirka,"I really like this, you did it perfectly, Tom."
22-10-2020T21:29:56,CrRAR,cuz the textures have to look good too?
22-10-2020T21:29:58,NezumiYuki,"In case we've forgotten, Tom loves world building, so a panorama image like this was inevitable.  <3"
22-10-2020T21:30:01,MuonNeutrino,cause yeah it looks COMPLETELY seamless
22-10-2020T21:30:04,Twokinds,Some of it was painted in 3D
22-10-2020T21:30:13,Twokinds,"Other times, I had to paint and then view it in the viewer"
22-10-2020T21:30:18,CrRAR,Yeah it does look like... depthy
22-10-2020T21:30:29,Twokinds,Getting the room's pespective right was the trickiest part
22-10-2020T21:30:35,CrRAR,esp the boards?
22-10-2020T21:30:36,Twokinds,"I tried to do it freehand, but I could never get it right"
22-10-2020T21:30:39,BadFoMo,I would never be able to wrap my head around drawing like this.
22-10-2020T21:30:39,Xwz,you used some reference to make the image distort match the 360
22-10-2020T21:30:47,Twokinds,"In the end, I actually modelled the room out in 3d"
22-10-2020T21:30:48,MuonNeutrino,"i can imagine, yeow"
22-10-2020T21:30:49,MuonNeutrino,lol
22-10-2020T21:30:59,Twokinds,"Then painted over with my own work, once I had something to work off of"
22-10-2020T21:31:03,CrRAR,yeah like right now it looks like a 6 wall room xD
22-10-2020T21:31:04,MoonDance,I would asked if you used the mirror tool for the floors but it doesn't seem like it
22-10-2020T21:31:13,BadFoMo,3D?! ...Can we see?
22-10-2020T21:31:19,Twokinds,hehee

22-10-2020T21:32:38,BADBackgroundProductions,I can totally see it now!
22-10-2020T21:32:40,Twokinds,and then just build the tavern
22-10-2020T21:32:45,BadFoMo,Oh... This is aceptable then.

22-10-2020T21:35:46,Twokinds,Stuff like the floor was the hardest part cause it'd do stuff like this
22-10-2020T21:35:56,IraNovaki,Youch
22-10-2020T21:36:02,CrRAR,the light glow on the floor is really realistic

22-10-2020T22:02:21,NezumiYuki,"Is it just me, or does Detritus look extra spoopy for some reason?"
22-10-2020T22:02:23,IraNovaki,That's good
22-10-2020T22:02:29,IraNovaki,Hello Detritus
22-10-2020T22:02:38,K3IDRAN,Detritus: :......
22-10-2020T22:02:41,MoonDance,"Sage, Permission to post the twitter demonstration of the CSP brush?"
22-10-2020T22:02:42,NezumiYuki,"Ah good to hear your nap was a good one, Rima"
22-10-2020T22:03:07,IraNovaki,Detritus is the creepeiest character of them all to me
22-10-2020T22:03:16,K3IDRAN,Tru

22-10-2020T22:04:12,MoonDance,Splatter Brush video on Twitter for CSP- https://twitter.com/hakuku/status/1276035340629766145?s=20
22-10-2020T22:04:22,IraNovaki,"I feel like Detritus was supposed to be a shell for Trace's mind to go into in case of death, but instead, he had decided to make it just like a back up drive"
22-10-2020T22:04:24,NezumiYuki,"Ah yes, Alabaster.... Good old ""You killed my son... Now you DIE!""   crazy Basitin General"
22-10-2020T22:05:01,IraNovaki,"More like: You killed my friend, now I'll kill your wife and ALL YOUR FRIENDS!!!"
22-10-2020T22:05:07,SageSaga,also Moon -
22-10-2020T22:05:23,MoonDance,What's up?
22-10-2020T22:05:31,RimaDraws,hi sage
22-10-2020T22:05:36,NezumiYuki,"That's more accurate, Ira.    Kill EVERYONE!"
22-10-2020T22:06:15,K3IDRAN,Slayer
22-10-2020T22:06:26,K3IDRAN,Kill the Enemy team to win
22-10-2020T22:06:29,Ordithus,Detritus is Halloween
22-10-2020T22:06:33,RimaDraws,ORD
22-10-2020T22:06:35,SageSaga,yo Rima :P
22-10-2020T22:06:36,NezumiYuki,"I can just imagine Alabaster in a World of Tanks match at the very start...  ""No Cap Kill ALL!"""
22-10-2020T22:06:39,RimaDraws,^^
22-10-2020T22:06:39,Ordithus,RIMA
22-10-2020T22:06:42,RimaDraws,yeee
22-10-2020T22:06:44,hyneria,I don't think Detritus is anythin that fancy. He was deemed a failure in the experiments to bring Saria back. I guess Trace wanted to create a new body for saria but made a copy of himself as a test first.
22-10-2020T22:06:58,SageSaga,Moon- are ya looking at my stream? XD
22-10-2020T22:07:09,MoonDance,hehe yeah XD
22-10-2020T22:07:09,RimaDraws,i see a nosebleed lol
22-10-2020T22:07:23,KeefMcDerpface,lol
22-10-2020T22:07:30,CrimsonHelsing,And kept Detritus to make some kind of use for him.
22-10-2020T22:07:36,MoonDance,Honestly the contexts can still work hehe
22-10-2020T22:07:52,NezumiYuki,Detritus... You might want to see a doctor my good fellow... Some of your ribs look... off....
22-10-2020T22:08:01,CrimsonHelsing,"If he had no use for him, Trace would have destroyed him"
22-10-2020T22:08:11,SageSaga,lots of these slash and blood splatter effects are nice
22-10-2020T22:08:20,hyneria,"No, he had use for him as a servant"
22-10-2020T22:08:29,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-confused: Not sure how to feel upon seeing Detritus at my front door on Halloween.
22-10-2020T22:08:41,Ordithus,give him all the candy
22-10-2020T22:08:43,MoonDance,Yeah a small handful earlier this year that got my interested
22-10-2020T22:08:46,hyneria,"but I doubt EvilTrace saw him as anything more than a thing, just like he did with Rose"
22-10-2020T22:08:48,Ordithus,"he needs it, you can see his bones"
22-10-2020T22:09:12,MoonDance,I see there are some tricks that CSP can do that photoshop cannot... Unless I haven't figured it out
22-10-2020T22:09:22,CrimsonHelsing,"A tool, you mean? @hyneria"
22-10-2020T22:09:25,hyneria,Yes
22-10-2020T22:10:01,CrimsonHelsing,"Exactly. It's not that he couldn't destroy him, Trace just chose not to."
22-10-2020T22:10:27,K3IDRAN,I'm gonna start calling the Scarab gun the Demon Rifle
22-10-2020T22:10:46,unsteddyphoenix,Heyyy detritus looking spookay
22-10-2020T22:10:56,hyneria,also I find weird DarkTrace didn't wanted Rose to be freed (and this for Detritus to be awakened). Maybe DarkTrace knows GoodTrace cannot control Detritus
22-10-2020T22:10:56,CrRAR,Trace is completely under-leveled for this battle
22-10-2020T22:11:00,CrRAR,hey unstedd
22-10-2020T22:11:02,Ordithus,hi teddy!

22-10-2020T22:12:03,hyneria,It just shows how downright sick Trace was
22-10-2020T22:12:08,IraNovaki,"So far, of all the online communities I've been in the Twokinds community is by the best"
22-10-2020T22:12:11,hyneria,before having his mind wiped out
22-10-2020T22:12:12,FenceEqualizer,Why is this music so fitting? Like Trace is about to have a boss battle in an rpg game
22-10-2020T22:12:17,hyneria,he was a total monster
22-10-2020T22:12:27,CrRAR,"Detritus: ""Creepypasta? Oh I have that right here."""

22-10-2020T22:13:43,K3IDRAN,Detritus would be a badass Follower on Skyrim
22-10-2020T22:13:48,NezumiYuki,Detritus~  Broken ribs?   hmm I hardly even noticed...
22-10-2020T22:13:50,MoonDance,Even a demon needs tea too!

22-10-2020T22:14:15,Ordithus,he was eating dinner before this all started

22-10-2020T22:15:29,NezumiYuki,"Does this mean that Detritus qualifies as a ""Danger Noodle"" ?"
22-10-2020T22:15:48,hyneria,In that old splash image Detritus has red hair
22-10-2020T22:15:58,hyneria,maybe he posseses Red D:
22-10-2020T22:16:06,CrRAR,maybeh
22-10-2020T22:16:21,hyneria,and then raine + tentacle looking tendrils D:
22-10-2020T22:16:32,K3IDRAN,I want a Possession mod for. Skyrim
22-10-2020T22:16:37,K3IDRAN,Now
22-10-2020T22:16:39,CrRAR,"I wonder if Trace learned Deathribbons:tm: from Detritus, of if he's just copying Trace anyway."
22-10-2020T22:17:52,K3IDRAN,Possess Ulfric and make him join the Empire
22-10-2020T22:18:11,NezumiYuki,"What is it about putting girls in crystals, anyway?   Starfox Krystal, and here, it's Maren..."
22-10-2020T22:18:25,TheArtOfDHT,hi
22-10-2020T22:18:36,NezumiYuki,hi DHT
22-10-2020T22:18:39,FenceEqualizer,Considering Deta is just the manifestation of old Trace will to revive his dead wife i‚Äôd guess copying
22-10-2020T22:18:53,FenceEqualizer,Or just made with those powers
22-10-2020T22:18:59,Twokinds,"Well, like I said in an earlier stream, she was just supposed to be on a table, but that's kinda boring"
22-10-2020T22:19:31,Ordithus,would look more like surgery than a possession :ctwokinds-eyeroll:
22-10-2020T22:19:31,SageSaga,Crystals are classic women suspension devices

22-10-2020T22:21:53,SageSaga,if he has a pacemaker then he kinda is-
22-10-2020T22:22:02,SageSaga,heck by some definitions I am a cyborg
22-10-2020T22:22:19,ZRO4825,You put out comic pages like one sometimes.  :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
22-10-2020T22:22:45,CrRAR,oh the tendrillll
22-10-2020T22:22:49,CrRAR,it comin'
22-10-2020T22:22:49,MoonDance,it is considered that those with small Wee-wee's are more high intelligent. Which is why david only has a small leaf
22-10-2020T22:22:55,SageSaga,some people define a cyborg as a human enhanced with technology- i wear glasses and they enhance my vision
22-10-2020T22:23:12,CrRAR,augmented reality
22-10-2020T22:23:14,MoonDance,Not wrong there
22-10-2020T22:23:23,TheArtOfDHT,I want AI built into my brain
22-10-2020T22:23:30,ZRO4825,"I'd like to go back to not needing to augment my reality, please."
22-10-2020T22:23:30,FenceEqualizer,That is technically true
22-10-2020T22:23:33,Ordithus,"tooth fillings, too"
22-10-2020T22:24:38,NezumiYuki,"Well on that note Sage, if your glasses were Google-Glasses, then you'd be even more of a cyborg"
22-10-2020T22:24:42,SageSaga,yep - anything you attach to your body or in your body that enhances your abilities as a person or interfacing with the world technically makes you a cyborg
22-10-2020T22:25:00,SageSaga,any technology*
22-10-2020T22:25:02,ZRO4825,Well we call them androids. :V

22-10-2020T22:29:38,hyneria,Was that chapter where the villain became just another Cell face?
22-10-2020T22:29:41,MoonDance,So it's not me who noticed that with PS?
22-10-2020T22:29:41,SageSaga,that's weird
22-10-2020T22:29:41,TheArtOfDHT,why is everyone still using PS as an art tool
22-10-2020T22:29:45,Twokinds,They want you to apply a stroke to a vector line

22-10-2020T22:30:51,MoonDance,Which what makes Photoshop resolution dependent

22-10-2020T22:35:05,CrRAR,"yeah, they take too many liberties lately with features and such"
22-10-2020T22:35:12,NezumiYuki,sad truth Fence
22-10-2020T22:35:15,MoonDance,I mean illustrator is more OP for things such as text and being resolution independent so I guess it'll still have some upper hand
22-10-2020T22:35:19,CrRAR,cuz they think they know the way
22-10-2020T22:35:21,AspiringNoodle,"Once a product becomes fleshed out, they need to come up with reasons to continue working on it and extracting more money from customers"
22-10-2020T22:35:24,CrRAR,but they don't
22-10-2020T22:35:38,CrRAR,yeah noodle
22-10-2020T22:35:47,Mediawatcher,Hoisted by his own petard
22-10-2020T22:35:49,AspiringNoodle,"Adobe is pretty far down that line, their products are pretty well fleshed out.  There isn't many new things they could add that are genuinely useful."
22-10-2020T22:36:08,AspiringNoodle,"So instead, they're now going to start looking at old tools and be like, ""We can make this BETTER!"""
22-10-2020T22:36:22,Twokinds,"Adobe does a lot of cool stuff I find very useful, but they also do a lot of really mindbogglingly bad moves too."

22-10-2020T22:37:15,MoonDance,Not sure if there is an update to this- but they threaten to sue those who still use versions older than 2015 and [Everyone disliked that ]
22-10-2020T22:37:18,CrRAR,"Did you keep the old version installed too Tom, not that it helps have 2 versions with separate features you want"
22-10-2020T22:37:24,CrRAR,lol
22-10-2020T22:37:31,IronHorseComics,actually the REAL mindboggling thing was changing how the transform tool worked
22-10-2020T22:37:33,AspiringNoodle,"They added a bunch of new steps to creating parties, removed the ability to add people on the fly, and added a bunch of other new problems inherent to their message groups system."
22-10-2020T22:37:36,Twokinds,Yeah I have both versions installed
22-10-2020T22:37:42,CrRAR,oh good
22-10-2020T22:37:55,IronHorseComics,it made no sense
22-10-2020T22:38:04,Twokinds,I can't really justify giving up the new features for just the line tool though
22-10-2020T22:38:26,CrRAR,yeah
22-10-2020T22:38:31,AspiringNoodle,"Give it time, they'll probably ruin a bunch of other tools you like xD"
22-10-2020T22:38:31,SageSaga,if enough people complain im sure they will fix it
22-10-2020T22:38:34,hyneria,Stoney to the rescue

22-10-2020T22:39:30,SageSaga,is it raise hell or raze hell?
22-10-2020T22:39:35,CrRAR,raise
22-10-2020T22:39:45,CrRAR,raze would be to... destroy hell
22-10-2020T22:39:52,Mediawatcher,Stone lizard for the save
22-10-2020T22:40:05,CrRAR,which actually sounds more severe and appropriate xD
22-10-2020T22:40:18,AspiringNoodle,"Pretty sure ""raze Hell"" is the expression"
22-10-2020T22:40:39,AspiringNoodle,Nothing more ominous that actually invading and destroying the concept of evil given form

22-10-2020T22:45:46,NezumiYuki,agreed Zakuru
22-10-2020T22:45:47,hyneria,well Stoney was the first
22-10-2020T22:45:53,hyneria,and likely is the strongest
22-10-2020T22:45:58,hyneria,the others are just bad copies
22-10-2020T22:46:18,IraNovaki,"Trace had requested help from Nora to make a perfect guardian for his child with Saria, but after that had failed, he lost hope and his mind"
22-10-2020T22:46:35,IraNovaki,"the bad ""copies"" were the ones he tried to make on his own"

22-10-2020T22:47:43,Mediawatcher,I‚Äôm guessing noras is more powerful

22-10-2020T22:47:47,johnnytho,Stoney flexing on Detritus
22-10-2020T22:48:01,Mediawatcher,Detritus is gonna have a bad time with Stoney!
22-10-2020T22:48:02,MuonNeutrino,flora and stony followed trace into the room
22-10-2020T22:48:03,Ordithus,Flora is in the room with Trace
22-10-2020T22:48:22,hyneria,Im kinda surprised Rose isn't helping Trace at all
22-10-2020T22:48:25,CrRAR,I wonder what sound the tentacle makes hitting Stoney?
22-10-2020T22:48:29,CrRAR,*splat*
22-10-2020T22:48:32,hyneria,Not even warning them Detritus is dangerous
22-10-2020T22:48:46,hyneria,unless she is on Detritus side
22-10-2020T22:49:11,NezumiYuki,A real villain~  Why would I warn the hero I'm attacking?!  That's just dumb!
22-10-2020T22:49:46,AspiringNoodle,Detritus may have locked Rose down now.
22-10-2020T22:49:47,Mediawatcher,Is trace really the hero? He started all of this
22-10-2020T22:49:51,hyneria,so Rose is bad after all? :thinking:
22-10-2020T22:49:59,AspiringNoodle,He did say that he was a failsafe in the event of Rose's restrictions being lifted.
22-10-2020T22:50:09,hyneria,she was able to tell Trace what he did to her
22-10-2020T22:50:22,hyneria,"she could have said ""run away"""
22-10-2020T22:51:06,AspiringNoodle,We still don't know the full extent of Trace's experiments.  Not exactly uncommon for magical experimentation to have lasting mental effects.

22-10-2020T22:52:17,Ordithus,Or not! I dunno
22-10-2020T22:52:21,AspiringNoodle,^
22-10-2020T22:52:32,AspiringNoodle,No idea if the restrictions kept her sanity grounded
22-10-2020T22:52:43,AspiringNoodle,"And that by removing them, some darker emotions might have seized control"
22-10-2020T22:53:39,IronHorseComics,"if that were the case, why would she try to help Raine?"
22-10-2020T22:54:34,hyneria,we don't know if she is. She pretty much told Raine to not trust her
22-10-2020T22:54:35,CrimsonHelsing,Good boy!
22-10-2020T22:54:47,hyneria,so Rose could be pulling a GoT Littlefinger
22-10-2020T22:54:52,AspiringNoodle,Probably because Raine is a blood relative?
22-10-2020T22:55:05,SageSaga,dunno if yall discussed this already- but what do yall think about if rose agreed to be used like this?
22-10-2020T22:55:29,hyneria,I guess that would cement Rose being on Detritus side?
22-10-2020T22:55:30,CrRAR,I feel it's possible
22-10-2020T22:55:39,AspiringNoodle,It is possible.  Would also be possible that Trace skipped on some details in order to use her.
22-10-2020T22:55:45,Ordithus,It would be believable
22-10-2020T22:55:50,CrimsonHelsing,"Stoney: ""hmph! Puny human magic..."""

22-10-2020T22:56:12,SageSaga,not sure if it would put rose on Det's side considering his purpose was to stop rose from gaining too much power?
22-10-2020T22:56:26,CrRAR,"Rock beats scissors, paper, and dark shadow blobs"
22-10-2020T22:56:32,KeefMcDerpface,lol
22-10-2020T22:56:36,AspiringNoodle,I should probably re-read the most recent pages.
22-10-2020T22:56:42,SageSaga,to be fair rock beats a lot of othings
22-10-2020T22:56:49,SageSaga,a lot of things*
22-10-2020T22:56:52,CrRAR,yus
22-10-2020T22:56:54,AspiringNoodle,It's entirely possible that Detritus is responsible for a *lot* of the stuff currently happening.
22-10-2020T22:57:12,Ordithus,probably nearly all of it
22-10-2020T22:57:20,AspiringNoodle,And spoopy Rose was just a misdirect?
22-10-2020T22:57:24,timmorn,I can't help but wonder if we where getting one comic per week as we where we would be at least three week into the answer of what is happening now
22-10-2020T22:57:45,CrRAR,I partly think sage that Rose could have been manipulated because of her love of Saria to stay alive.
22-10-2020T22:58:06,CrRAR,"""used"" though, depends how much was her own will"
22-10-2020T22:58:51,SageSaga,ehhh people are manipulated all the time- it doesnt mean its always a bad thing
22-10-2020T22:59:05,CrRAR,"could have had no say whatsoever, now is just making the best of it"
22-10-2020T22:59:23,CrRAR,"""This is my afterlife now"""
22-10-2020T22:59:45,FenceEqualizer,You have to give past Trace credit. He's so willing to save his life he's willing to have a shadow clone kill his current self to save Saria.
22-10-2020T22:59:46,Ordithus,she was at least getting chummy with Trace before the madness began
22-10-2020T23:00:17,CrRAR,It was a pretty unprovoked attach here so far tbh
22-10-2020T23:00:24,CrRAR,"""no, don't do that"""
22-10-2020T23:00:26,AspiringNoodle,She also could've killed Trace the moment he lifted the restrictions... which she joked about...
22-10-2020T23:00:34,NezumiYuki,WELP... Time to binge Re-read the later chapters of Twokinds!
22-10-2020T23:00:34,CrRAR,*tentacle attack to the face*
22-10-2020T23:00:47,AspiringNoodle,"I'm gonna have to go ahead and say all the dark, spoopy stuff is definitely Detritus' doing, now."
22-10-2020T23:00:57,SageSaga,generally i would say even if you left out some details- if those details wouldnt have changed your mind- the manipulation is kinda fine
22-10-2020T23:01:17,SageSaga,if the details left out would have changed your mind- well thats generally bad manipulation
22-10-2020T23:01:35,CrRAR,"good persuasion, really"
22-10-2020T23:01:48,MuonNeutrino,"well, he specifically said he activated the guardians, and he implies he's in control of the ritual"
22-10-2020T23:01:50,SageSaga,persuasion is just manipulation
22-10-2020T23:01:56,MuonNeutrino,so yeah most likely the spoopy stuff is all detrius

22-10-2020T23:46:59,AspiringNoodle,Also some funny in-progress bloopers
22-10-2020T23:47:02,KeefMcDerpface,^

22-10-2020T23:47:31,Dadrobit,"Just turning the phone off, no calling me in allowed."
22-10-2020T23:47:34,NezumiYuki,We can all blame Detritus for wanting ribs tonight... LOL I caved in and asked hubby to phone our local eatery for a take out*
22-10-2020T23:47:38,Ordithus,yikes man

22-10-2020T23:47:49,K3IDRAN,Welp i'm gunna go 2. Bed Brain you better give me a good dream
22-10-2020T23:47:54,Twokinds,"Aw man, Photoshop 2021 also has another bug"
22-10-2020T23:47:59,Dadrobit,"I actually saw, I lurked in here for a minute a few hours ago."
22-10-2020T23:48:00,AspiringNoodle,Oh no
22-10-2020T23:48:02,KeefMcDerpface,?!
22-10-2020T23:48:02,K3IDRAN,Waat
22-10-2020T23:48:05,Twokinds,Or I hope it's a bug and not another change for the worse
22-10-2020T23:48:16,Dadrobit,"Negative, Sage! Thankfully!"
22-10-2020T23:48:18,NezumiYuki,awww noooo
22-10-2020T23:48:23,Twokinds,"I can't pan around while drawing a line with the lasso tool, which is really important."
22-10-2020T23:48:34,KeefMcDerpface,Oh no
22-10-2020T23:48:36,K3IDRAN,Damn
22-10-2020T23:48:38,NezumiYuki,wait what Tom?!?!?!
22-10-2020T23:48:41,SageSaga,thats vital to how you color
22-10-2020T23:48:43,Ordithus,you use that a ton
22-10-2020T23:48:51,Dadrobit,"Huh, that 100% sounds like a bug."
22-10-2020T23:48:52,NezumiYuki,dats bull schite!
22-10-2020T23:48:59,Twokinds,Yeah
22-10-2020T23:49:06,AspiringNoodle,"""How to ruin Tom's workflow 101"""
22-10-2020T23:49:07,Twokinds,This is going to make things impossible
22-10-2020T23:49:17,NezumiYuki,oh holy fek!
22-10-2020T23:49:17,Twokinds,Looks like it's back to 2020
22-10-2020T23:49:27,SageSaga,or-
22-10-2020T23:49:36,AspiringNoodle,"Jeebus, I know I made a joke about giving Photoshop time to ruin some other tools"
22-10-2020T23:49:39,SageSaga,you could color like a human being instead of some kinda robot
22-10-2020T23:49:41,K3IDRAN,Photoshop: I'm gonna remove Laso hahaha
22-10-2020T23:49:42,AspiringNoodle,But I didn't think it'd be 1 ding-dang night.
22-10-2020T23:49:47,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-Flip1::cw0lfmare-Flip2: that's it do it in paint
22-10-2020T23:49:50,Dadrobit,You can revert to legacy versions? Or are you trying a beta version?
22-10-2020T23:50:11,K3IDRAN,Gn guys
22-10-2020T23:50:12,Twokinds,"I didn't delete the old install, so I still have both versions"
22-10-2020T23:50:16,TheSexyBeast,Photoshop 2021 - by Bethesda
22-10-2020T23:50:23,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-grossedout:
22-10-2020T23:50:23,Dadrobit,Gotcha
22-10-2020T23:50:26,CrRAR,smarttt
22-10-2020T23:50:29,CrRAR,yeah
22-10-2020T23:50:39,K3IDRAN,Sergeant. K3IDRAN offline for now
22-10-2020T23:50:57,NezumiYuki,take care Keidran
22-10-2020T23:51:02,CrRAR,Devs gotta stop acting like people can relearn software or take crippling changes like it's nothing.
22-10-2020T23:51:04,Dadrobit,Surprised a download contains the full program and isn't just a launcher to download the most recent version from a server.
22-10-2020T23:51:15,TheSexyBeast,Nite Kei
22-10-2020T23:51:16,Dadrobit,o/ dran
22-10-2020T23:51:22,K3IDRAN,U too. Nezumi
22-10-2020T23:51:27,K3IDRAN,Aye
22-10-2020T23:51:49,Twokinds,Very annoying
22-10-2020T23:51:52,NezumiYuki,Please stand by while Tom launches PhotoShop 2020
22-10-2020T23:51:59,CrRAR,The way Adobe works is that the CC app lets you manage all the different apps and keep versions and such
22-10-2020T23:52:03,Twokinds,I'll continue using the old version and just use the new one for the extra features
22-10-2020T23:52:10,CrRAR,yeah
22-10-2020T23:52:25,CrRAR,Photoshop: Cool patterning edition
22-10-2020T23:52:28,SageSaga,make sure to message Adobe or say something on twitter and get it spread around
22-10-2020T23:52:35,NezumiYuki,"I hope that upgrade didn't cost too much, Tom?"
22-10-2020T23:52:38,Twokinds,yeah actually I'll message them now
22-10-2020T23:52:44,Ordithus,nice that the files are compatible
22-10-2020T23:53:00,CrRAR,if PSDs didn't interact... that's be BAAADD
22-10-2020T23:53:19,CrRAR,that'd
22-10-2020T23:53:27,SageSaga,even if they werent you could just save them out as a different file type that works in both
22-10-2020T23:54:28,CrRAR,gotta preserve layers doe
22-10-2020T23:54:41,CrRAR,I guess there are a few layer-supporting formats tho
22-10-2020T23:54:46,Dadrobit,"PT is not so nice. Everything is locked to my account which is locked to a physical proprietary flash drive. If I update, it locks me to the update."
22-10-2020T23:55:07,Dadrobit,It's next level ridiculous.
22-10-2020T23:55:17,SageSaga,there are lots of layer supporting formats and you can also export each layer as its own if you want to ensure nothing is lost
22-10-2020T23:55:25,NezumiYuki,"Hey Tom, here's a list of issues Adobe knows about and either has fixed or IS ABOUT to fix with the Oct update to photoshop.   Link is here.  https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/kb/fixed-issues.html"
22-10-2020T23:55:27,CrRAR,ah
22-10-2020T23:55:51,CrRAR,wow long list
22-10-2020T23:55:56,CrRAR,:ptv-confused:
22-10-2020T23:56:21,Dadrobit,It's be easier to list what currently is working lol.
22-10-2020T23:56:27,NezumiYuki,Yea I'll be blunt... it's not something you want to see on any new update......
22-10-2020T23:56:56,CrRAR,should just be a beta xD
22-10-2020T23:57:39,Dadrobit,"Oh, I see, these ARE the fixed issues. Mixed it up thinking they were just ""known"" issues."
22-10-2020T23:58:20,NezumiYuki,"I haven't read the whole thing yet, but I'm hoping the dynamic canvas rotation is in that list somewhere...."
22-10-2020T23:58:37,CrRAR,oh that link with the fixed issues also has the 'feedback site' link
22-10-2020T23:59:02,NezumiYuki,Also it doesn't make sense to me why lasso selections would interfere with the canvas rotation?
22-10-2020T23:59:41,Twokinds,So dumb
22-10-2020T23:59:51,NezumiYuki,"Ahh okay ""Fixed"" issues... hmmmm"
