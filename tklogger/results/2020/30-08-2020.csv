30-08-2020T18:01:19,SpazztasticKiwi,no maybe that was sythe with Maren and someone else
30-08-2020T18:29:37,CrRAR,"well, you do probably remember the sketch"
30-08-2020T18:30:06,CrRAR,you're remembering what your brain perceived you remembered

30-08-2020T20:07:50,CrRAR,hi rima
30-08-2020T20:14:32,AspiringNoodle,"Rima, have you said your praises to plant-kun yet?"
30-08-2020T20:44:17,SpazztasticKiwi,pickles
30-08-2020T21:15:21,SpazztasticKiwi,guys
30-08-2020T21:15:42,SpazztasticKiwi,someone made a scale of all the main horror villains
30-08-2020T21:16:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Jeepers Creepers is the tallest - I‚Äôve always thought Jason was the tallest
30-08-2020T21:16:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"Jason, Michael and Leatherface are all the same height"
30-08-2020T21:18:12,CrRAR,oh cool
30-08-2020T21:19:35,CrRAR,Yeah Jason seems quite imposing
30-08-2020T21:19:53,CrRAR,He‚Äôs pretty stalky.
30-08-2020T21:20:30,CrRAR,Meanwhile jeeper creeper guy is corn-stalky
30-08-2020T21:20:50,SpazztasticKiwi,üóû
30-08-2020T21:21:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Jason is supposedly a little over 6 feet but there‚Äôs scenes in some movies - and some actors that played him - that put him more at 6‚Äù6
30-08-2020T21:22:48,CrRAR,"He just built like a wall, no escape when he shows up. Might explain the hockey mask - no one gets past. >:"

30-08-2020T21:24:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I was unreachably excited to see them all lined up like this
30-08-2020T21:25:03,SpazztasticKiwi,unreasonably
30-08-2020T21:25:35,SpazztasticKiwi,the hockey mask became a thing because he was bullied for his disfigurement
30-08-2020T21:25:37,CrRAR,"That‚Äôs pretty legit, I‚Äôm kinda sad no crazy leprechaun."
30-08-2020T21:25:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Freddy‚Äôs so short
30-08-2020T21:26:16,CrRAR,...and I was not aware jeepers dude was more like a buff freddy guy
30-08-2020T21:26:18,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floAAA:
30-08-2020T21:26:27,SpazztasticKiwi,JC kinda just blending in like
30-08-2020T21:26:38,CrRAR,Even has the style kinda
30-08-2020T21:26:47,SpazztasticKiwi,he‚Äôs not buff really although he could be
30-08-2020T21:26:48,AspiringNoodle,"There's a movie where JC realistically should've died, lol"
30-08-2020T21:26:55,CrRAR,Fashionable murderer swag
30-08-2020T21:27:08,AspiringNoodle,But the dude has literal plot armor
30-08-2020T21:27:23,SpazztasticKiwi,remember Jeepers Creepers could absorb whatever features/limbs he wanted by eating them
30-08-2020T21:27:52,AspiringNoodle,There was a movie where he goes toe to toe with the military :|
30-08-2020T21:27:54,SpazztasticKiwi,he reminds me of a goth raven
30-08-2020T21:28:00,AspiringNoodle,"Not a full unit, but they brought a minigun with them"
30-08-2020T21:28:17,AspiringNoodle,"...hold on, think it might've been a 50 cal..."
30-08-2020T21:28:25,SpazztasticKiwi,super dark and depressing in the background like any minute he‚Äôll start writing enough poetry
30-08-2020T21:28:32,SpazztasticKiwi,emo
30-08-2020T21:28:54,SpazztasticKiwi,making pinhead and the nun look lacking
30-08-2020T21:29:00,CrRAR,Yeah I remember one where they take him out as he marches across a field
30-08-2020T21:29:12,CrRAR,or something
30-08-2020T21:29:20,SpazztasticKiwi,nuke him and see if he walks out of that
30-08-2020T21:29:28,CrRAR,lol
30-08-2020T21:29:36,SpazztasticKiwi,can‚Äôt eat new parts if there‚Äôs no mouth
30-08-2020T21:30:02,CrRAR,Just burn the Blair Witch woods down!
30-08-2020T21:30:07,CrRAR,Easy!
30-08-2020T21:30:24,CrRAR,"No woods, no house, no witch1"
30-08-2020T21:30:28,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, I was right, minigun"
30-08-2020T21:30:30,SpazztasticKiwi,they didn‚Äôt add chuckys bride tho
30-08-2020T21:30:54,CrRAR,Ah yes bath toaster bride lady
30-08-2020T21:31:12,AspiringNoodle,So here's why I'm not really interested in Jeepers Creepers *unless* theyf inally kill the damned monster
30-08-2020T21:31:18,SpazztasticKiwi,literally the only one with a girlfriend
30-08-2020T21:31:26,CrRAR,"That‚Äôs one of the few chuckies I‚Äôve seen, AND in theaters"
30-08-2020T21:31:29,AspiringNoodle,"We know that it can be injured, and we know that it comes out of hibernation to get body parts to heal itself"
30-08-2020T21:32:01,AspiringNoodle,"But the thing has so much flippin' plot armor I can't stand it.  In Jeepers Creepers 3, the military shows up, and here's how it goes down"
30-08-2020T21:32:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Leatherface has seen better days
30-08-2020T21:32:17,AspiringNoodle,"Near the end of the film, they find the thing driving down the road in its signature truck"
30-08-2020T21:32:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean I know none of them are sweet to look at but eegh
30-08-2020T21:32:32,AspiringNoodle,"They shoot a minigun at it, but the truck is so damn bullet proof, not only does it *not* get shot full of holes"
30-08-2020T21:32:36,CrRAR,"Yeah, and freddy is usally preety dapper"
30-08-2020T21:32:39,AspiringNoodle,It reflects the bullets back at the truck with the gun..
30-08-2020T21:32:42,CrRAR,He looks rough
30-08-2020T21:32:55,SpazztasticKiwi,#iveseenthemovies
30-08-2020T21:32:57,CrRAR,That‚Äôs crazy
30-08-2020T21:33:10,AspiringNoodle,And then moments later the thing eats minigun fire temporarily
30-08-2020T21:33:29,CrRAR,And it only enrages him
30-08-2020T21:33:32,CrRAR,Right?
30-08-2020T21:33:53,SpazztasticKiwi,https://youtu.be/I7D7uuehO6w
30-08-2020T21:34:00,AspiringNoodle,"Nah, he was already diving in for the kill"
30-08-2020T21:34:10,AspiringNoodle,"But miniguns fire anywhere from 2,000 - 6,000 bullets a minute"
30-08-2020T21:34:16,CrRAR,Ah okay
30-08-2020T21:34:29,AspiringNoodle,33 - 100 bullets per second
30-08-2020T21:34:35,CrRAR,"Yeah, typically would just shred anything"
30-08-2020T21:35:17,AspiringNoodle,JC4 is in the works
30-08-2020T21:35:52,AspiringNoodle,"I hope they bring a .50 cal.  Miniguns are great and all, but this thing calls for Ma Deuce"
30-08-2020T21:37:46,SpazztasticKiwi,you‚Äôre asking for logic in a movie where the monster eats people to regenerate
30-08-2020T21:37:48,AspiringNoodle,"RAR, have you seen what happens when a .50 bullet goes off without a chamber?"
30-08-2020T21:38:47,AspiringNoodle,"TBF, I suspended my disbelief enough"
30-08-2020T21:38:58,AspiringNoodle,"Like, magically seeking hand-to-hand weapons"
30-08-2020T21:39:08,AspiringNoodle,The ability to retrieve them without physically picking them up
30-08-2020T21:39:20,CrRAR,"Probably dangerous, like a cherry bomb or something"
30-08-2020T21:39:23,AspiringNoodle,And a truck that seems to work *perfectly* even though the dude uses it a few nights once every 23 years
30-08-2020T21:39:34,CrRAR,Now with deadly projectile!
30-08-2020T21:39:48,AspiringNoodle,"But I draw the line at ""convenient plot armor is convenient"""
30-08-2020T21:40:07,SpazztasticKiwi,nobody said you gotta watch em or like em
30-08-2020T21:41:11,AspiringNoodle,I did like the movies.  Until 3
30-08-2020T21:42:22,CrRAR,Maybe he just hijacks the nearest spokktacular halloween hayride truck he can find
30-08-2020T21:42:37,AspiringNoodle,"...I can't remember... did the movies ever cover the question ""If he sleeps for 23 years, why not destroy the body then?"""
30-08-2020T21:43:23,AspiringNoodle,"Because I know at least in 3, they know about the creeper, what it is, how it functions, and that it sleeps for 23 years"
30-08-2020T21:43:59,AspiringNoodle,"That's like... find where it's sleeping, pile up a metric ton of c4, and blow the damn thing sky high"
30-08-2020T21:45:01,CrRAR,Sounds like he‚Äôs on a locusts‚Äô schedule
30-08-2020T21:50:34,CrRAR,The jeeper creeper guy‚Äôs overall design is so remincent of like a Hellboy/Del Toro type character
30-08-2020T21:51:18,CrRAR,"Like imaginative but like well thought out, kinda scary but with style and personality kinda"
30-08-2020T21:52:55,CrRAR,Especially with the face appendage stuff
30-08-2020T21:53:09,CrRAR,That‚Äôs like classic del toro
30-08-2020T22:11:51,CrRAR,Maybe every 23 years he just escapes the del toro universe cuz he gets bored fighting hellboy or something
30-08-2020T22:12:34,CrRAR,"‚ÄúNeed more organs, that old red bastard beat my old ones to a pulp‚Äù"
