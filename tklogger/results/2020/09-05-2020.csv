09-05-2020T16:17:07,NeonMitsumi,Unless there's a first drop that's dubstep

09-05-2020T16:19:00,IronHorseComics,they got a subgenre for everything
09-05-2020T16:19:09,NeonMitsumi,That'd just be noise.
09-05-2020T16:19:10,SniperJackal,I just narrow it down to a few genres
09-05-2020T16:19:17,SniperJackal,not overcomplicating
09-05-2020T16:19:18,NeonMitsumi,Unless you want to make a two hour long song.

09-05-2020T20:00:46,BadFoMo,Natani.
09-05-2020T20:00:47,KeefMcDerpface,^
09-05-2020T20:00:58,Dadrobit,Shoulda picked Raine.

09-05-2020T20:01:04,steelabjur,Big Bad Natani
09-05-2020T20:01:20,KeefMcDerpface,Why Raine?
09-05-2020T20:01:40,Dadrobit,I mean... Thematically that's her schtick.
09-05-2020T20:02:04,Dadrobit,Big bad wolf tries to be human to lure little Red. Raine already can change between.
09-05-2020T20:02:37,Dadrobit,Coulda even been Raine as the big bad wolf with literally Red as Red.
09-05-2020T20:02:51,Ordithus,"The straight play is good, though"
09-05-2020T20:02:52,Dadrobit,Missed opportunity imo.

09-05-2020T20:06:48,w0lfmare,Yes. It will make more sense with the next page

09-05-2020T20:19:36,BadFoMo,"Before it's to late, did anyone vote for 'How would Clovis look if Nora had transformed them into a Mermaid Keidran instead?'?"
09-05-2020T20:22:04,Ordithus,it was somewhere on my list.  mermaids ain't my thing
09-05-2020T20:22:08,InTheLionsDen,It was moved to my selected Ballot list but not top billing.
09-05-2020T20:23:02,HoverdudeXL,Tom already finished??
09-05-2020T20:23:22,Ordithus,was a short stream - I think he didn't sleep well
09-05-2020T20:23:23,KeefMcDerpface,yes
09-05-2020T20:23:34,HoverdudeXL,Ohh.
09-05-2020T20:23:41,HoverdudeXL,Ok then
09-05-2020T20:24:28,BadFoMo,"It was in mine too, but the poll says that it got 0 votes."
09-05-2020T20:25:26,Ordithus,that means it got knocked out before it was at the top of anyone's list
09-05-2020T20:27:13,BadFoMo,Then what's the point of having a list if the other things in that list /don't/ get a vote?!
09-05-2020T20:30:03,Ordithus,do you understand how instant runoff voting works?
09-05-2020T20:30:11,AspiringNoodle,Nope
09-05-2020T20:30:14,AspiringNoodle,Please elaborate :D
09-05-2020T20:30:24,BadFoMo,I'm watching the video again.
09-05-2020T20:30:31,GoldNightCat,Hello there.
09-05-2020T20:30:35,Ordithus,"""The alternative vote (also known as instant-runoff voting) is a voting system where each voter can vote for as many of the options as they want, ranking them in order of their preference. At the end of each round of voting"""
09-05-2020T20:30:51,Ordithus,"""the candidate with the least votes is eliminated, and every ballot that had that candidate as the top pick switches to their next-preferred not-yet-eliminated candidate. This has the effect of simulating what would have happened if the eliminated"""
09-05-2020T20:31:01,Ordithus,"""hadn't run in the first place, which allows people to more easily vote based on their preferences, rather than what they think might realistically win."""
09-05-2020T20:31:42,Ordithus,"So when something got ""0"" votes, that means no one had it at the TOP of their list"
09-05-2020T20:32:22,Ordithus,Could have been lower down - maybe even somewhat high up.  The system isn't perfect
09-05-2020T20:33:01,AspiringNoodle,Systems are so interesting
09-05-2020T20:33:07,AspiringNoodle,Especially when viewed from a game perspective
09-05-2020T20:33:43,AspiringNoodle,"Also, DEAR LORD I NEED A HAIR CUT."
09-05-2020T20:34:02,AspiringNoodle,My hair is finally long enough that I'm having to tuck it behind my ears :ptv-shock:
09-05-2020T20:34:09,Roughlandin,Henlo all! Welp. Missed my first Sunday stream this year. Mother's day is a decent excuse though...
09-05-2020T20:34:19,KeefMcDerpface,Hello Rough
09-05-2020T20:34:29,Roughlandin,Keef! You is red
09-05-2020T20:34:34,KeefMcDerpface,yep
09-05-2020T20:34:37,Roughlandin,Noice
09-05-2020T20:34:45,KeefMcDerpface,And I found something for you.
09-05-2020T20:34:49,KeefMcDerpface,One minute.
09-05-2020T20:34:55,Roughlandin,Did stream run short tonight? Only went from 5-9
09-05-2020T20:35:16,Ordithus,"yeah, Tom didn't sleep well so it was a short stream"
09-05-2020T20:35:20,Ordithus,But a good one
09-05-2020T20:35:48,Roughlandin,Ah. Makes sense. Oh well. Can't complain since I was absent lol.
09-05-2020T20:36:08,Roughlandin,Also all strem is good strem Ord
09-05-2020T20:36:47,Roughlandin,Guess I'll have to catch the recording and make funny quips in my head
09-05-2020T20:36:51,BadFoMo,@Ordithus So TKPolls only shows how many 1st place votes each thing got?
09-05-2020T20:37:21,Ordithus,It shows the cumulative total as the runoff happens
09-05-2020T20:38:15,Ordithus,"So in round 1 a suggestion might have 5 votes, then in round 2 maybe it got 2 more as the bottom one was eliminated, then 1 more, and so on until its done"
09-05-2020T20:40:51,Roughlandin,Dang. Seems my Han Solo Natani lost out to Slave Leia Natani. Now that's what I call Revenge of the Thirst
09-05-2020T20:41:01,Ordithus,haha
09-05-2020T20:41:10,KeefMcDerpface,lol
09-05-2020T20:41:19,Ordithus,Personally I ranked Han Nat higher
09-05-2020T20:41:24,KeefMcDerpface,same
09-05-2020T20:41:28,Roughlandin,Aw thanks guys
09-05-2020T20:41:46,KeefMcDerpface,"Besides, we already had Slave Leia Kat."
09-05-2020T20:42:09,Roughlandin,"(Not gonna complain about some big metal bikini woof, though...)"
09-05-2020T20:42:27,Roughlandin,Though Nat might
09-05-2020T20:43:04,InTheLionsDen,"Big woof, little metal bikini."
09-05-2020T20:43:11,Ordithus,[It's not even comfortable]*:ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:
09-05-2020T20:43:25,KeefMcDerpface,"Honestly not sure if Nat would wear such things even if told they give a buff in something. (Offense, defense, magic, etc.)"
09-05-2020T20:43:52,InTheLionsDen,+10 Basitin tease
09-05-2020T20:43:57,KeefMcDerpface,haha
09-05-2020T20:44:10,BadFoMo,"Sorry to keep harping on the same thing, but shouldn't that mean that the polls should show that it got something? That some people had it in their list?"
09-05-2020T20:44:33,InTheLionsDen,Only if the items in their lists were eliminated before it got eliminated.
09-05-2020T20:44:54,Roughlandin,"Nat: ""Ow, ow, OW! Who came up with the idea of wearing a metal bra on a Desert Planet with TWO SUNS!?"""
09-05-2020T20:45:13,RimaDraws,does anyone remember how tall brutus is?
09-05-2020T20:45:25,Roughlandin,He's like 7 foot 8 right?
09-05-2020T20:45:33,KeefMcDerpface,He's very tall.
09-05-2020T20:45:36,Ordithus,7 miles 8 furlongs
09-05-2020T20:45:42,KeefMcDerpface,lol
09-05-2020T20:45:47,RimaDraws,"7'8""?"
09-05-2020T20:45:48,Roughlandin,About 2 and a half Cubits
09-05-2020T20:45:52,Roughlandin,Yeah Rima
09-05-2020T20:45:59,Ordithus,I don't actually know
09-05-2020T20:46:14,RimaDraws,that dont sound right because i remember 7foot even
09-05-2020T20:46:38,Roughlandin,Idk either. Think Tom mentioned in the sketch where he and Clovis go out together
09-05-2020T20:47:21,Roughlandin,"All I know is Nat and Zen are tallest in the main cast, and Brutus is taller than they are by a significant margin"
09-05-2020T20:47:48,Ordithus,He's probably taller than Jade
09-05-2020T20:48:01,RimaDraws,"jade is 7'4"""
09-05-2020T20:48:08,Dadrobit,"No Fomo. If no one put it as their first place pick, then after the first round of counting is concluded then it would have zero votes and get immediately eliminated."
09-05-2020T20:49:35,Roughlandin,Now I'm imagining that Basitin Leadership is chosen the same way it is in Invader Zim. The tallest one is the leader. Jade better hope Brutus never gets bamfed to Basidia...
09-05-2020T20:50:19,KeefMcDerpface,But it's been confirmed that the strongest gets the role.
09-05-2020T20:50:28,Ordithus,And Brutus has no ambition
09-05-2020T20:51:18,Roughlandin,"I know. Also true, Ord. Though having a big puppy who doesn't care about governing as leader is a pretty funny idea."
09-05-2020T20:52:59,Ordithus,":ctwokinds-daydreamingkat: clean, poofy pillows"
09-05-2020T20:53:04,Ordithus,washed my pillows today
09-05-2020T20:53:08,InTheLionsDen,:ctwokinds-florajiggle:
09-05-2020T20:53:29,Ordithus,:csagesaga-bounce:
09-05-2020T20:53:32,Roughlandin,Nothing better than a nice pair of pillows to rest one's head on
09-05-2020T20:54:56,KeefMcDerpface,"Brutus: ""How did I get here? I was sent out by the boss to find Carver. And now I'm the Basitin King."""
09-05-2020T20:55:49,Roughlandin,"Brutus, surrounded by pretty Basitin girls: ""...It's good to be the King!"""
09-05-2020T20:56:05,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-laugh:
09-05-2020T20:57:25,Ordithus,"real talk, Basitin girls are <3"
09-05-2020T20:58:04,KeefMcDerpface,Can't deny that.
09-05-2020T20:58:20,Roughlandin,"Ah, Basidia. Come for the East Basitin cuisine. Stay for the West Basitin ladies..."
09-05-2020T20:59:28,Roughlandin,"I need to put in my suggest for an update on Carver's time with the WB sisters, but I'm having a hard time paring it down into a easy length for quick voting..."
09-05-2020T21:00:22,Roughlandin,"I'd also like to coax Tom into finally giving the sisters canon names so I can stop refering to them in my headcanon as WB, Gabby, and Spooky"
09-05-2020T21:01:42,KeefMcDerpface,"""Spooky"""
09-05-2020T21:01:46,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-laugh:
09-05-2020T21:03:45,KeefMcDerpface,"Next thing you know, Tom makes those the canon name."
09-05-2020T21:03:52,KeefMcDerpface,*names
09-05-2020T21:03:58,Roughlandin,"She's the quiet one. WB is the dark furred eldest sister, and Gabby is the youngest one with the blonde hair"
09-05-2020T21:05:16,Roughlandin,"My headcanon is, Carver gives them all nicknames because he can't be bothered to learn their real Basitin names. Also, minorly annoying them is one of the few joys he has left while in exile"
09-05-2020T21:06:22,KeefMcDerpface,"By quiet you don't mean 'mute', right?"
09-05-2020T21:07:08,Roughlandin,"No no. Actually, looking at the Ch 19 epilogue page... She talks! I could have sworn WB and Gabby were the only ones that spoke"
09-05-2020T21:07:33,KeefMcDerpface,"Well, I'm seeing what you're seeing."
09-05-2020T21:07:50,Roughlandin,I guess it's just her intense face. But she seems like the quiet type to me
09-05-2020T21:07:59,KeefMcDerpface,"WB, right?"
09-05-2020T21:08:32,Roughlandin,Eh. I think Tom confirmed WB can speak on stream once
09-05-2020T21:09:01,KeefMcDerpface,Actions speak louder than words?
09-05-2020T21:09:13,Roughlandin,A spear to the face is a loud action
09-05-2020T21:09:37,KeefMcDerpface,yep \o/ <---- \o
09-05-2020T21:09:47,Roughlandin,Lol. Though I tfigure they warm up to Carve pretty quick
09-05-2020T21:09:59,Ordithus,why? he's a prick
09-05-2020T21:10:22,RimaDraws,he is a prick.
09-05-2020T21:11:04,Dadrobit,He is a prick
09-05-2020T21:11:05,Roughlandin,He is. But there's only so much of a prick you can be while trapped on an island in the middle of nowhere
09-05-2020T21:11:33,Dadrobit,"Nah, that just amplifies the prick."
09-05-2020T21:12:00,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-kippi2: The prick is strong with this one.
09-05-2020T21:12:35,Roughlandin,"Anyway, I imagine he'd get trained pretty quick once he learns that only non-pricks get to eat in West Basidian culture"
09-05-2020T21:13:11,Dadrobit,You're making a lot of assumptions here.
09-05-2020T21:14:09,Roughlandin,"I have yet to meet a West Basidian prick. Quite literally. Barring half of Keith, we've yet to see a male West Basitin"
09-05-2020T21:15:32,Dadrobit,You've also only ever seen 4 of them. It's like saying all tigers are a bunch of cunts based off of how Flora was treated by the Tiger enteroge
09-05-2020T21:15:56,KeefMcDerpface,"Pfft, now I'm imaging that scene from Pirates of the Caribbean when Jack was running on the beach with the cannibal tribe following behind."
09-05-2020T21:16:19,KeefMcDerpface,But with Carver being chased by the Basitins.
09-05-2020T21:16:23,RimaDraws,entourage
09-05-2020T21:16:35,Roughlandin,And now I can't imagine Carver being voiced by anyone but Johnny Depp
09-05-2020T21:16:44,Dadrobit,We know little to nothing about them other than they don't have the innate mind control and they're a bit more lax on clothes.
09-05-2020T21:17:01,Dadrobit,"Thanks Rima, I knew I was spelling that wrong."
09-05-2020T21:17:08,RimaDraws,its ok
09-05-2020T21:17:51,Roughlandin,"Can half naked, beautiful tropical people with relaxed social standards BE pricks? Is that allowed?"
09-05-2020T21:18:12,KeefMcDerpface,Maybe? If you're a prick to them?
09-05-2020T21:18:28,Dadrobit,Ever been to Hawaii as a soldier or family of a soldier?
09-05-2020T21:18:58,Dadrobit,"Suddenly, pricks. Pricks everywhere."
09-05-2020T21:21:35,Roughlandin,"This is why I stay quiet and sip my funky coconut drinks when I go abroad. Can't be a prick to a chubby tourist bear in a Hawaiian shirt and flip flops. I mean, you can, but I'd probably start agreeing with you."
09-05-2020T21:25:24,Roughlandin,Welp. I'm gonna try to get to sleep at a decent hour tonight for a change. Hopefully I'll catch next week's stream. Night all!
09-05-2020T21:25:34,Ordithus,night rough
09-05-2020T21:25:37,KeefMcDerpface,Night Rough
09-05-2020T21:25:42,Roughlandin,o/
09-05-2020T21:25:54,JojoGD,Right rough
09-05-2020T21:26:12,Dadrobit,o/
09-05-2020T21:31:01,KeefMcDerpface,"Well, I'm hopping off too. See you all later."
09-05-2020T21:31:22,Dadrobit,Cya keef
09-05-2020T21:31:23,Ordithus,bye keef
09-05-2020T21:35:43,AspiringNoodle,"Dadro, can confirm"
09-05-2020T21:35:58,AspiringNoodle,"Father served the military when he was younger, was stationed in Hawaii for 3 years"
09-05-2020T21:36:02,AspiringNoodle,Locals were a bunch of a-holes
09-05-2020T21:36:42,Ordithus,"on the other hand, hawaiian food in Anchorage is yum"
09-05-2020T21:37:09,Dadrobit,Brother was stationed there for four. Just got out about a year ago. Still the same attitude towards military.
09-05-2020T21:47:25,AspiringNoodle,I can't exactly blame them.  Apparently the US acquired the islands by some rather shady means
09-05-2020T21:47:48,AspiringNoodle,"But at the same time, there comes a point where you need to let. It. Go."
09-05-2020T22:05:07,Ordithus,Let it go :notes:
09-05-2020T22:29:35,RimaDraws,let it go
09-05-2020T23:16:51,RimaDraws,anyway bed time for me. see you guys later
09-05-2020T23:27:54,SpazztasticKiwi,🦉
09-05-2020T23:49:37,AspiringNoodle,I swear Apex Legends is a drug
