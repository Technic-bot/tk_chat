13-09-2020T16:14:11,CrRAR,"Yeah those were pretty special, but still good recent films"
13-09-2020T16:14:32,CrRAR,Was it Waitiki the director of Ragnarok?
13-09-2020T16:16:10,CrRAR,He's a zany director gives his movies such good energy though

13-09-2020T23:21:10,SpazztasticKiwi,the scream or someone‚Äôs toe crunching
13-09-2020T23:28:17,Dadrobit,Scream
13-09-2020T23:28:34,Dadrobit,It's actually iconic at this point.
13-09-2020T23:30:34,Dadrobit,First time I saw it I thought it was the most well done modern country song parody I'd ever seen.
13-09-2020T23:30:45,Dadrobit,Then I learned....
13-09-2020T23:31:54,SpazztasticKiwi,either Ethan and Mark have the same shirt or they‚Äôre swapping wardrobes
13-09-2020T23:34:02,Dadrobit,"I mean, as long as they're washing it?"
13-09-2020T23:36:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt care if they are really - that‚Äôs their fish to fry
13-09-2020T23:37:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I just had a wait a minute moment cause I knew I‚Äôd seen that design before
13-09-2020T23:37:39,Dadrobit,.....ewwwww.....
13-09-2020T23:38:24,Dadrobit,"Maybe s'just me, but I didn't even like my girlfriend wearing my shirts if they were used. Like, just grab one out of the closet please!"
13-09-2020T23:41:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark has openly admitted to wearing the same shirt for days
13-09-2020T23:41:49,SpazztasticKiwi,so like I said - it‚Äôs their fish to fry
13-09-2020T23:42:00,SpazztasticKiwi,humans are disgusting anyway
13-09-2020T23:42:22,Dadrobit,"I'll wear a second layer shirt for an extra day or two, but the undershirt must go."
13-09-2020T23:47:14,SpazztasticKiwi,the pair is true chaotic evil
13-09-2020T23:47:21,SpazztasticKiwi,what more can be said really
13-09-2020T23:48:14,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs just too bad they can‚Äôt include Se√°n anymore since corona
13-09-2020T23:48:25,SpazztasticKiwi,then it‚Äôs really a party
13-09-2020T23:51:32,Dadrobit,Se√°n is the Irish one?
13-09-2020T23:58:02,SpazztasticKiwi,yep
13-09-2020T23:58:02,Dadrobit,Honestly I feel kinda bad that I stopped watching Mark a couple years back.
13-09-2020T23:58:11,SpazztasticKiwi,he only got better
13-09-2020T23:58:59,Dadrobit,I remember hopping onto YouTube to check him out after he asked for help on Tom's forums and thought he was adorable fun.
13-09-2020T23:59:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve yet to consider adorable a description for Mark
