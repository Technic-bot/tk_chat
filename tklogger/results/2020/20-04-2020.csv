20-04-2020T00:11:32,AspiringNoodle,...I'm such a nerd...
20-04-2020T00:12:15,AspiringNoodle,"Was watching a Youtube video about difficult to comprehend SCPs.  And one that interested me was SCP-2719, codename ""Inside"""
20-04-2020T00:12:25,AspiringNoodle,A variable abstract-metaphysical pointer.
20-04-2020T00:12:50,AspiringNoodle,"After reading the entry, I was able to get it after like a minute of thought xD"
20-04-2020T00:13:26,AspiringNoodle,"Basically, whatever this thing is, it can ""point"" to ideas, or physical places, beings, or objects."
20-04-2020T00:14:02,AspiringNoodle,"If something ""becomes inside"", it's the new address.  If something ""Went inside."" it is now being stored there."
20-04-2020T00:14:49,SpazztasticKiwi,unus annus has become top tier crackhead energy
20-04-2020T00:15:49,AspiringNoodle,"My favorite part was ""O5 - Became inside."" ""Dr. Zermelo - Went inside."" ""Punishment - Became inside."" ""O5-7 - Went inside."""
20-04-2020T00:16:16,AspiringNoodle,"Give you a wild guess what those 4 entries mean, lol"
20-04-2020T01:06:40,SpazztasticKiwi,did you hear about the actress that got stabbed
20-04-2020T01:06:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Reese...
20-04-2020T01:12:48,SpazztasticKiwi,“Witherspoon?”
20-04-2020T01:13:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"no, with a knife - yay jokes dead time for movie"
20-04-2020T01:45:04,AspiringNoodle,I've been sucked into Dark Souls... again
20-04-2020T01:45:08,AspiringNoodle,Not sure if good or bad @w@
20-04-2020T02:20:12,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, I love this kitty in Dark Souls 2.  Every time I enter her house she's in a new spot xD"
20-04-2020T02:20:24,AspiringNoodle,"Now she's sitting at the desk like a person, with her cute little paws up top~"

20-04-2020T11:12:35,ThoseButterflys,I have no other reaction than this
20-04-2020T11:37:52,TerraTheWizard,so i had to google what coppertone was
20-04-2020T11:37:57,TerraTheWizard,because apparently that's a US only thing
20-04-2020T11:38:05,TerraTheWizard,or at least north america only
20-04-2020T12:04:38,ThoseButterflys,same
20-04-2020T12:05:06,ThoseButterflys,I am to young to know what it was
20-04-2020T12:06:25,ThoseButterflys,But inthe Marks korean candy video I love how Tom just dissagrees with everyone and says the foods good
20-04-2020T12:56:11,AspiringNoodle,"Oh yeah, Coppertone is a cultural meme"
20-04-2020T12:56:26,AspiringNoodle,"The little girl, the tan line, the dog pulling the swimsuit to reveal bare booty xD"
20-04-2020T12:56:43,AspiringNoodle,Man has society evolved

20-04-2020T13:56:37,TerraTheWizard,gotta be up at 2am again so :ctwokinds-RainezZz:
20-04-2020T14:14:09,K3IDRAN,K3PO idk
20-04-2020T15:45:37,CrimsonQuill,Good evening.
20-04-2020T15:45:45,CrimsonQuill,Blargs
20-04-2020T16:19:38,CrRAR,More rain here
20-04-2020T16:19:46,CrRAR,more wind
20-04-2020T16:20:00,CrRAR,:fog::ctwokinds-keith8D:
20-04-2020T16:20:05,AspiringNoodle,Mostly wind where I'm at
20-04-2020T16:20:15,AspiringNoodle,So tired.  Got work tomorrow *yawn*
20-04-2020T16:20:25,CrimsonQuill,Project due next wednesday
20-04-2020T16:20:34,AspiringNoodle,"I'm just waiting for some of my coworkers to snap, lol"
20-04-2020T16:20:48,CrimsonQuill,Coworker needs me to swap his tuesday for my thursday because of a personal thingamabob
20-04-2020T16:20:58,AspiringNoodle,"And tbh, if corporate keeps reducing the store's hours bit by bit every week, eventually we'll hit a breaking point."
20-04-2020T16:20:59,CrimsonQuill,Which is the day before my project is due
20-04-2020T16:21:06,CrimsonQuill,Nose to the grindstone
20-04-2020T16:21:30,CrimsonQuill,@AspiringNoodle I'm surprised that it hasn't been reached already
20-04-2020T16:21:49,CrRAR,"People will probably just stop coming in, unless people start camping outside."
20-04-2020T16:21:59,CrRAR,What trend are you seeing?
20-04-2020T16:22:03,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, I think it's because some of my coworkers sign off on stuff that they barely did, and nobody in charge bothers to check"
20-04-2020T16:22:22,AspiringNoodle,"So they ""complete"" the checklist, but they don't actually complete it xD"
20-04-2020T16:22:43,AspiringNoodle,"If anything, it seems like MORE people are coming in than normal"
20-04-2020T16:23:32,CrRAR,Big rush
20-04-2020T16:25:14,CrimsonQuill,Sheesh
20-04-2020T16:26:06,AspiringNoodle,"My official job title should be ""lottery monkey and sanity sponge"""
20-04-2020T16:26:27,AspiringNoodle,"Because people are coming in either for lottery, or they're going stir crazy so they come to us for small things just so they can get out of the house"
20-04-2020T16:27:13,AspiringNoodle,"And considering I am now required to start wearing a mask to work, I am reaching ever increasing levels of ""I don't want to work anymore"" :ptv-unimpressed:"
20-04-2020T16:27:36,CrimsonQuill,"I'm still waiting for mine, we're a bit low on supply"
20-04-2020T16:27:52,CrimsonQuill,"But it's not so bad for me, as I don't have direct contact with Nursing Home Residents."
20-04-2020T16:28:02,CrimsonQuill,"Perks of being a Dishwasher, I suppose."
20-04-2020T16:28:02,AspiringNoodle,"If our store just cut all self serve already, it wouldn't be so bad.  Seriously.  I went to change out a bag of iced coffee on saturday"
20-04-2020T16:28:22,AspiringNoodle,The damn thing was near full.  This thing sat for 2 weeks almost untouched
20-04-2020T16:28:32,CrimsonQuill,vomits
20-04-2020T16:28:46,AspiringNoodle,"Oh please, they're supposed to sit for 2 weeks"
20-04-2020T16:29:10,AspiringNoodle,"My point is that in a two week period, this thing maybe sold 1 or 2 cups"
20-04-2020T16:29:32,AspiringNoodle,"We keep putting time, energy, and resources into keeping the coffee bar running, but that thing is dead on second shift"
20-04-2020T16:29:41,AspiringNoodle,I'm pretty sure we end up dumping >90% of what we make
20-04-2020T16:30:26,AspiringNoodle,"I feel like this place is being mismanaged to a ridiculous degree.  And at this point, the only thing that is keeping me going is the hope that the government will bolster the pay for essential personnel"
20-04-2020T16:31:53,AspiringNoodle,"Because honestly, how the company has handled this whole thing does not inspire confidence"
20-04-2020T16:32:34,CrimsonQuill,I'm still waiting for it all to crash down...
20-04-2020T16:32:47,CrimsonQuill,But the toff's won't really be affected will they?
20-04-2020T16:33:09,AspiringNoodle,"Lmao, oh trust me, they're getting slammed"
20-04-2020T16:33:17,CrimsonQuill,They'll just be sitting on their bloody arses lining their fat pockets while the people on the bottom desperately try to scrape enough for a meal the bloody bastards
20-04-2020T16:33:21,AspiringNoodle,Some celebrities are poking fun at poor people wanting their jobs back
20-04-2020T16:33:27,AspiringNoodle,And are getting rightly slaughtered for it
20-04-2020T16:33:30,CrimsonQuill,@AspiringNoodle That is reasurring.
20-04-2020T16:33:45,CrimsonQuill,I'll lay my cards on the table here.
20-04-2020T16:33:52,CrimsonQuill,I wish I didn't have to work for a living.
20-04-2020T16:33:55,CrimsonQuill,But at the same time...
20-04-2020T16:34:06,CrimsonQuill,Not having to work is worse for me.
20-04-2020T16:34:23,CrimsonQuill,"Working, at least, means I'm doing SOMETHING to help society."
20-04-2020T16:34:32,AspiringNoodle,"Imo, we should still work for a living.  But the fact that we're working harder and longer than in the past, while making less is a huge problem"
20-04-2020T16:34:40,CrimsonQuill,It is.
20-04-2020T16:34:52,AspiringNoodle,"For decades, they predicted that advances in technology meant we would work LESS"
20-04-2020T16:34:55,CrimsonQuill,It seems some of the most essential jobs are the lowest paid
20-04-2020T16:35:10,AspiringNoodle,"That the hard fought 40 hour, 5-day work week would be a thing of the past"
20-04-2020T16:35:15,CrimsonQuill,@AspiringNoodle I have the perfect Calvin and Hobbes Strip for that.
20-04-2020T16:35:25,AspiringNoodle,"But instead, we're going the OTHER direction"
20-04-2020T16:35:42,AspiringNoodle,"Pay is barely going up, but people are starting to work 50, 60, and even over 70 hour work weeks on the regular."
20-04-2020T16:36:02,AspiringNoodle,"Right now, I'm only working 2 days a week at the gas station, and that place exhausts me"
20-04-2020T16:36:49,CrimsonQuill,"Would you consider a €10.00 an hour minimum wage a decent one, or too low?"
20-04-2020T16:37:01,AspiringNoodle,"Before the pandemic, I was fine working just 3 days a week.  I was working 4, but I don't want to be there full time.  There was a bunch of technical issues that made every day a pita"
20-04-2020T16:37:41,AspiringNoodle,"So 3 days was a happy balance of me not being there enough for the problems to get to me, and making enough to get by and save for future prospects."
20-04-2020T16:38:44,AspiringNoodle,"But now... I'm debating whether 2 is the equivalent of my old 3, or if I just don't want to be there, period."
20-04-2020T16:39:07,CrimsonQuill,Understandable given what you've told us about the day.
20-04-2020T16:39:38,AspiringNoodle,"Looks like it's about $12.30 an hour, so that's pretty decent"
20-04-2020T16:40:21,AspiringNoodle,"The current federal minimum wage, which hasn't been updated in like a decade, is still $7.25 an hour, or €5.90"
20-04-2020T16:41:05,CrimsonQuill,WOW.
20-04-2020T16:41:10,CrimsonQuill,"That's very low,"
20-04-2020T16:41:17,AspiringNoodle,"Some states have started increasing the wage to $15 an hour (€12.20), but it's had very serious economic impacts"
20-04-2020T16:41:37,CrimsonQuill,"Well, the problem isn't that there isn't enough money..."
20-04-2020T16:41:39,AspiringNoodle,And part of the problem is that capitalism is backing itself into a bit of a corner
20-04-2020T16:41:44,CrimsonQuill,It's just in the wrong places.
20-04-2020T16:41:52,CrimsonQuill,And people are spending it the wrong way.
20-04-2020T16:41:53,CrimsonQuill,...
20-04-2020T16:42:06,AspiringNoodle,"Essentially, competition and innovating have made things cheaper, higher quality, and more available"
20-04-2020T16:42:10,CrimsonQuill,"I really want to rant, but to be honest, ranting won't fix the problem..."
20-04-2020T16:42:27,CrimsonQuill,We do need more innovation...PROPER innovation.
20-04-2020T16:42:38,CrimsonQuill,"Because the way I see it, we're stagnating badly."
20-04-2020T16:42:56,CrimsonQuill,Renewables haven't seen much love because of the FREAKING OIL LOBBIES
20-04-2020T16:42:59,AspiringNoodle,"So this means that companies have to sell more to make similar amounts of money, but at the same time they can't purposefully rig stuff to break in a predetermined amount of time, or that goes against consumer protection laws"
20-04-2020T16:43:10,CrimsonQuill,At least there's that.
20-04-2020T16:43:18,CrimsonQuill,I hate planned obselescence.
20-04-2020T16:43:25,CrimsonQuill,Obsolecence
20-04-2020T16:43:42,CrimsonQuill,Good to see laws are catching up on it.
20-04-2020T16:43:47,AspiringNoodle,"Combine that with shareholders / investors and the highest levels of corporations vacuuming up as much profit as they can, and you got a recipe for disaster"
20-04-2020T16:45:30,AspiringNoodle,"Also, the EU might be taking a sledgehammer to Apple's generational cord controversy, lol"
20-04-2020T16:45:45,CrimsonQuill,What's the generational cord controversy?
20-04-2020T16:45:46,AspiringNoodle,"Remember how it seemed like EVERY generation, the newest iPhone needed a new charging cord?"
20-04-2020T16:45:53,CrimsonQuill,Ah.
20-04-2020T16:45:55,CrimsonQuill,Aheh
20-04-2020T16:46:19,CrimsonQuill,Please tell me that the EU is saying 'DENIED!'  to Apple's practices
20-04-2020T16:46:28,CrimsonQuill,Because if so
20-04-2020T16:46:49,AspiringNoodle,"The EU is basically looking in the direction of, ""F*** your eWaste nightmare bs.  We are looking towards REQUIRING a universal standard."""
20-04-2020T16:46:50,CrimsonQuill,That's as funny as Samsung making Apple count $1'000'000 in pennies
20-04-2020T16:46:56,CrimsonQuill,Niiiice.
20-04-2020T16:47:45,AspiringNoodle,"""Samsung pay Apple $1 Billion by sending 30 trucks full of 5 cent coins. Samsung sent 30 trucks filled with 5-cent coins to Apple's head quarters in California today. Samsung were forced to pay Apply $1 billion after a law case however they weren't told"
20-04-2020T16:47:46,AspiringNoodle,"that they had to pay in a specific method."""
20-04-2020T16:47:58,AspiringNoodle,That is the pettiest thing I've ever read and I love it.
20-04-2020T16:48:22,CrimsonQuill,My aunt and mum told us about it.
20-04-2020T16:48:32,CrimsonQuill,Samsung should have won the case.
20-04-2020T16:48:43,CrimsonQuill,They made the damn parts in Apple stuff.
20-04-2020T16:48:51,CrimsonQuill,But at least they had the last laugh!
20-04-2020T16:48:55,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-laugh:
20-04-2020T16:49:06,AspiringNoodle,"But yeah, that's something I agree with on the EU.  Apple has their proprietary cable they use for iPhones, while every other Android phone on the market uses mini-usb (USB Type-B)"
20-04-2020T16:49:27,CrimsonQuill,A standardized USB port would mean much lest e-waste.
20-04-2020T16:49:43,AspiringNoodle,This would actually prevent ANY company from pulling a switcheroo every generation
20-04-2020T16:50:05,AspiringNoodle,"And instead, would cause any changes to be implemented because of an upgrade in the standard."
20-04-2020T16:50:50,CrimsonQuill,I like it.
20-04-2020T16:50:58,CrimsonQuill,I need to read up more on this stuff.
20-04-2020T16:51:22,AspiringNoodle,I can tell you the core of the problem with the US economy.
20-04-2020T16:51:22,CrimsonQuill,"But tomorrow, I'm just going to be reading scholarly articles on how Site Selection can be used in GIS"
20-04-2020T16:51:31,CrimsonQuill,Go on.
20-04-2020T16:51:35,AspiringNoodle,Investors and shareholders.
20-04-2020T16:51:41,CrimsonQuill,I see.
20-04-2020T16:51:50,CrimsonQuill,Investors and Shareholders want profists first
20-04-2020T16:52:02,CrimsonQuill,And however good the intentions of the boss at the start
20-04-2020T16:52:09,CrimsonQuill,Either they are replaced
20-04-2020T16:52:13,AspiringNoodle,"They have a place, but not in companies that have saturated their respective markets"
20-04-2020T16:52:21,CrimsonQuill,Or they are corrupted by trying to meet the bottom line
20-04-2020T16:52:49,CrimsonQuill,"It always seems that companies start off small and decent, then become...nasty when they grow."
20-04-2020T16:52:50,AspiringNoodle,"For small companies just starting out, they are a boon.  They are an influx of cash that can be used to invest in their product and help secure their business"
20-04-2020T16:53:05,AspiringNoodle,"And as they grow, so do their profits."
20-04-2020T16:53:20,AspiringNoodle,But what happens when a company becomes so large that it plateaus and saturates its market?
20-04-2020T16:53:42,AspiringNoodle,"Well, if you listen to the investors and shareholders, their response is, ""Make us more money, we don't give a f*** how you do it.""  And the courts have their backs."
20-04-2020T16:54:03,CrimsonQuill,"I have two words for them, and I don't care if they are illogical."
20-04-2020T16:54:06,CrimsonQuill,FUCK. THEM.
20-04-2020T16:54:10,CrimsonQuill,Seriously.
20-04-2020T16:54:17,AspiringNoodle,This causes companies to start buying up other companies either in the same market or new markets so they can start branching out.
20-04-2020T16:54:25,CrimsonQuill,It's far better and more sustainable to have a steady income
20-04-2020T16:54:37,CrimsonQuill,"Than a short burst of massive profit, and then a loss."
20-04-2020T16:54:38,AspiringNoodle,This is one way they can increase their profits to please the public owners of the company
20-04-2020T16:54:48,AspiringNoodle,The other way is to screw over the customer.
20-04-2020T16:55:03,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-unimpressed::ptv-unimpressed::ptv-unimpressed:
20-04-2020T16:55:04,AspiringNoodle,"Loot boxes are effectively gambling, and they have saturated so many games it's not even funny."
20-04-2020T16:55:10,CrimsonQuill,...
20-04-2020T16:55:16,AspiringNoodle,"But they WORK.  Overwatch made $1,000,000,000 in its first year"
20-04-2020T16:55:19,CrimsonQuill,begins to whistle angrily
20-04-2020T16:55:40,AspiringNoodle,Overwatch has made great strides to make loot boxes more consumer friendly
20-04-2020T16:55:52,AspiringNoodle,But they ultimately remain the only consistent way to earn anything in game
20-04-2020T16:56:07,CrimsonQuill,Do you think they should be banned entirely?
20-04-2020T16:56:20,CrimsonQuill,Because they are in my opinion quite terrible things.
20-04-2020T16:56:29,AspiringNoodle,"That said, Blizzard are pretty generous with giving them out.  3 boxes a week for winning 9 arcade games (should honestly be just 9 games PLAYED), and 1 box per level.  Also 1 free box at the start of any holiday event."
20-04-2020T16:56:57,AspiringNoodle,"On top of that, their loot boxes give 0 duplicate items of any given rarity until you have effectively drained that pool."
20-04-2020T16:57:55,AspiringNoodle,"The psychological factors is definitely a heavy influence in saying that at the very least, they need to be labelled AO."
20-04-2020T16:58:07,CrimsonQuill,I suppose
20-04-2020T16:58:31,AspiringNoodle,"But to be fair, the reason they became such a problem is that the less scrupulous companys *cough cough EA cough cough* have abused them and made them as worst as possible."
20-04-2020T16:59:25,AspiringNoodle,But the reason I bring up loot boxes is because they are an effective way for companies to take advantage of their customers and extract ever increasing amounts of cash.
20-04-2020T16:59:29,CrimsonQuill,EA is the poster boy for bad videogame company
20-04-2020T16:59:37,CrimsonQuill,...
20-04-2020T16:59:58,AspiringNoodle,But because the issue has blown up and governments are investigating and / or banning them left and right EA is going to have a HUGE problem in the future.
20-04-2020T17:00:21,AspiringNoodle,Their FIFA series relies almost exclusively on loot boxes to bring in money.  It's a ridiculous huge portion of their yearly revenue
20-04-2020T17:00:31,CrimsonQuill,Serves them bloodym right the bastards
20-04-2020T17:00:55,AspiringNoodle,"So if loot boxes end up being becoming AO, or even outright banned, they're going to crash hard."
20-04-2020T17:01:23,CrimsonQuill,laughs in sadistic pleasure
20-04-2020T17:02:09,AspiringNoodle,"So, in 2019, EA made $4.95 billion"
20-04-2020T17:02:26,CrimsonQuill,That's...obscene
20-04-2020T17:02:31,AspiringNoodle,"So that's how much money they brought it, not counting costs or profits"
20-04-2020T17:03:09,AspiringNoodle,"oooo, here's a fun tidbit"
20-04-2020T17:03:32,AspiringNoodle,FIFA's Ultimate Team is the online multiplayer mode that relies on card packs (loot boxes) for players to progress
20-04-2020T17:03:41,AspiringNoodle,"You open a pack, you get players"
20-04-2020T17:03:50,AspiringNoodle,"That is the only way.  Much pay, very win."
20-04-2020T17:03:56,CrimsonQuill,There are going to be microtransactions in Halo Infinite
20-04-2020T17:04:08,CrimsonQuill,But 343 is going to try make them as unintrusive as possible
20-04-2020T17:04:33,AspiringNoodle,"So in 2017, Ultimate Team made up 16% of EA's revenue. 21% in 2018.  And 28% in 2019."
20-04-2020T17:05:05,AspiringNoodle,"Whereas purchases for the game itself made up 11%, 11%, and 14% of yearly revenue, respectively"
20-04-2020T17:05:24,CrimsonQuill,..
20-04-2020T17:05:29,CrimsonQuill,That's just obscene.
20-04-2020T17:05:41,AspiringNoodle,"So combined, FIFA made up 27%, 32%, and 42% of EA's revenue, respectively."
20-04-2020T17:06:19,CrimsonQuill,...
20-04-2020T17:06:22,AspiringNoodle,"So if EA loses the ability to toss card packs into Ultimate Team, it's gonna take a huge hit out of their profits."
20-04-2020T17:06:29,CrimsonQuill,Good.
20-04-2020T17:06:35,CrimsonQuill,"Seriously, I don't like 'em"
20-04-2020T17:07:02,AspiringNoodle,"So, there's a good chance that the removal of card packs could also impact sales of the game itself"
20-04-2020T17:07:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I gotta lunchable
20-04-2020T17:07:16,CrimsonQuill,Hiya Spazztastic!
20-04-2020T17:07:35,AspiringNoodle,"But if they do a Battlefront 2 style revamp, it could also increase sales of the game units."
20-04-2020T17:07:57,CrimsonQuill,Blegh
20-04-2020T17:08:00,AspiringNoodle,"The problem is that too much of their revenue is the result of them taking advantage of customers, and not making a good product."
20-04-2020T17:08:23,AspiringNoodle,"...I just realized that I am hungry, haha"
20-04-2020T17:08:24,CrimsonQuill,I've read about it
20-04-2020T17:08:33,CrimsonQuill,"Not me, I had pancakes today!"
20-04-2020T17:08:36,CrimsonQuill,And  veg
20-04-2020T17:08:46,CrimsonQuill,Though tomorrow's gonna be a fustercluck.
20-04-2020T17:08:58,CrimsonQuill,Dinner'll be Curry...a lot of dirty dishes..
20-04-2020T17:09:37,AspiringNoodle,"So, Crimson, in short"
20-04-2020T17:10:02,AspiringNoodle,"The big problem isn't that these companies are inherently scummy, it's just that they are facing the investor / shareholder problem full force"
20-04-2020T17:10:12,CrimsonQuill,I see now.
20-04-2020T17:10:16,AspiringNoodle,And being super scummy is the only way they can keep them happy
20-04-2020T17:10:35,CrimsonQuill,...Capitalism needs a huge reform
20-04-2020T17:10:42,AspiringNoodle,"And the only way to do that is to make shareholders and investors realize that with big companies, long-term stability is the most preferable approach"
20-04-2020T17:11:02,AspiringNoodle,"With smaller companies, yeah, grow them profits.  Because the company is growing as a result."
20-04-2020T17:11:31,AspiringNoodle,But they probably won't change their tune because human greed is a powerful thing.
20-04-2020T17:11:49,AspiringNoodle,So the next best thing would be to remove their teeth so to speak.
20-04-2020T17:12:08,CrimsonQuill,'Love of money is the route of all evil'
20-04-2020T17:12:21,AspiringNoodle,The courts have to determine that publicly traded companies do NOT have a responsibility to make money for the investors and shareholders.
20-04-2020T17:12:46,AspiringNoodle,"That as long as they are keeping the company healthy and thriving, the ""owners"" can pound dirt."
20-04-2020T17:13:07,CrimsonQuill,I think I see.
20-04-2020T17:13:29,AspiringNoodle,Because that's the issue at the moment.
20-04-2020T17:13:57,AspiringNoodle,Shareholders / investors believe that the company has an obligation to make them money and get them an ROI
20-04-2020T17:14:24,AspiringNoodle,"And if the company is NOT acting in the way they want, they can go to the courts and claim that the company isn't acting in THEIR best interest"
20-04-2020T17:14:32,CrimsonQuill,I understand what you're saying.
20-04-2020T17:14:42,CrimsonQuill,"I'll be honest, you should work in business"
20-04-2020T17:14:48,AspiringNoodle,"And this is where a company ends up replacing the leaders, or paying a fine."
20-04-2020T17:14:59,CrRAR,"Yeah, they sacrifice the goods and services and livelihoods they provide to an extreme to constantly procure more profits."
20-04-2020T17:15:07,CrimsonQuill,I admit.
20-04-2020T17:15:14,CrimsonQuill,The more money I earn at work
20-04-2020T17:15:20,CrimsonQuill,The more I feel I have to hoard it
20-04-2020T17:15:22,CrimsonQuill,For later
20-04-2020T17:15:32,CrRAR,It changes from “produce good product” to “Make biggest money”
20-04-2020T17:15:47,AspiringNoodle,Saving isn't inherently a bad thing
20-04-2020T17:16:14,AspiringNoodle,"The problem is determining when you've crossed the line from ""producing a sizeable safety net"" to ""make all monehz"""
20-04-2020T17:16:43,AspiringNoodle,"And sadly, here's my advice for new companies.  Never go public."
20-04-2020T17:16:54,AspiringNoodle,The moment your company is publicly traded is the moment you're screwed.
20-04-2020T17:17:21,CrimsonQuill,I hopefully won't run into that problem
20-04-2020T17:17:24,AspiringNoodle,"Example, Apple."
20-04-2020T17:17:38,CrimsonQuill,The thing about the surveying business is that you HAVE to do a good job.
20-04-2020T17:17:45,AspiringNoodle,"Steve Jobs.  Brilliant businessman with some tech savy, starts the company, gets good workers to help build amazing products"
20-04-2020T17:18:02,AspiringNoodle,"Fast forward a few decades, it removed from his own company because the shareholders / investors weren't happy"
20-04-2020T17:18:07,AspiringNoodle,Apple starts declining
20-04-2020T17:18:18,AspiringNoodle,They bring him back to turn the ship around.  Then he dies.
20-04-2020T17:18:34,CrRAR,"Haha, “Oh hey, we needed that guy”"
20-04-2020T17:18:45,AspiringNoodle,"Ironically, Steve Jobs said it best"
20-04-2020T17:18:57,CrRAR,>Basically cofounds Pixar in the meantime
20-04-2020T17:19:00,AspiringNoodle,"When marketing / finance people make it into leadership positions in a company, then you're screwed"
20-04-2020T17:19:06,CrRAR,Yup
20-04-2020T17:19:17,AspiringNoodle,"They don't care about making a good product, they only care about making the numbers look good."
20-04-2020T17:19:20,CrimsonQuill,I'm learning a lot about business in these conversations.
20-04-2020T17:19:27,CrimsonQuill,And the cutthroat nature of it.
20-04-2020T17:19:31,AspiringNoodle,"Company A, renowned for making high quality hardware for construction"
20-04-2020T17:19:49,AspiringNoodle,CEO retires and finance leader takes over.
20-04-2020T17:20:02,CrRAR,Giving them control is the worst because the idea the company was founded on isn’t even theirs.
20-04-2020T17:20:11,AspiringNoodle,Company A now makes mediocre quality hardware.
20-04-2020T17:20:25,CrRAR,They have no concept of what makes the company successful.
20-04-2020T17:20:31,AspiringNoodle,"And while sales are down, profits are up due to cheaper ingredients in the hardware."
20-04-2020T17:20:37,CrRAR,Yeah
20-04-2020T17:20:45,AspiringNoodle,"Finance guy: ""I've done an amazing job."" :ptv-hearts:"
20-04-2020T17:20:46,CrRAR,It’s parasitic
20-04-2020T17:21:01,CrRAR,“We think gud idea!”
20-04-2020T17:21:07,CrimsonQuill,...
20-04-2020T17:21:08,CrimsonQuill,...
20-04-2020T17:21:14,CrimsonQuill,must. not. rant.
20-04-2020T17:21:26,AspiringNoodle,I don't rant
20-04-2020T17:21:31,AspiringNoodle,I dissect :upside_down:
20-04-2020T17:22:08,AspiringNoodle,This is why I like working for my 2nd job
20-04-2020T17:22:25,AspiringNoodle,"I barely get ANY work, and it pays about the same as the station (a bit more without the hazard pay applied)"
20-04-2020T17:22:43,AspiringNoodle,But it's all private.  He's funded development through lottery winnings (the irony)
20-04-2020T17:23:03,AspiringNoodle,And he's using this pandemic as a great opportunity to grow the company.
20-04-2020T17:23:46,CrimsonQuill,Nice work.
20-04-2020T17:24:15,AspiringNoodle,"In the near future, the app's about to have 200 more businesses that need coupons added"
20-04-2020T17:24:56,CrimsonQuill,Neato!
20-04-2020T17:25:00,AspiringNoodle,"I imagine the majority of them will be restaurants, lol"
20-04-2020T17:25:17,AspiringNoodle,they'll want the extra traffic
20-04-2020T17:25:40,AspiringNoodle,"I'm honestly not sure if the app will survive in the end, but I'll be damned if I haven't seen decent signs"
20-04-2020T17:26:02,CrimsonQuill,Good luck with it anywa
20-04-2020T17:26:18,AspiringNoodle,"For as small as we are, there was a pizza place near where I live that had probably had about a coupon redemption a day for a 2 week period.  All unique ids"
20-04-2020T17:26:53,AspiringNoodle,That's the largest amount of redemptions I've EVER seen.
20-04-2020T17:27:39,CrimsonQuill,Woah
20-04-2020T17:27:55,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, just read the comic strip"

20-04-2020T17:28:53,AspiringNoodle,"The comic was what I said in a nutshell, lmao"

20-04-2020T17:32:58,CrimsonQuill,Aheh
20-04-2020T17:33:07,CrimsonQuill,I must say
20-04-2020T17:33:14,CrimsonQuill,I am glad we have these conversations
20-04-2020T17:33:25,CrimsonQuill,because they force me to use my brain to examine everything
20-04-2020T17:33:40,CrimsonQuill,And I can't just laze around and give generic answers
20-04-2020T17:34:04,AspiringNoodle,It's a lot like how games companies are suddenly restructuring
20-04-2020T17:34:26,AspiringNoodle,The AAA industry got too used to relying on crunch to finish games on schedule.
20-04-2020T17:34:37,AspiringNoodle,And in the past few years consumers have been pushing back.
20-04-2020T17:34:48,AspiringNoodle,Ghost Recon: Breakpoint ironically broke Ubisoft.
20-04-2020T17:34:59,AspiringNoodle,"They're restructuring their entire company because of one game, lol"
20-04-2020T17:35:22,CrimsonQuill,Good thing#
20-04-2020T17:35:28,AspiringNoodle,Exactly
20-04-2020T17:35:45,AspiringNoodle,"If I spend 60+ hours doing a job, I want it to be because I CHOSE to spend that time"
20-04-2020T17:35:55,AspiringNoodle,Not because deadlines are everywhere and they're demanding it be done.
20-04-2020T17:36:12,AspiringNoodle,It's part of the reason I'm looking at animation.
20-04-2020T17:36:14,CrimsonQuill,"There are, of course, some jobs we can't choose."
20-04-2020T17:36:20,CrimsonQuill,But are essential.
20-04-2020T17:36:26,CrimsonQuill,Sewer and sanitation workers
20-04-2020T17:36:29,CrimsonQuill,Shop assistants
20-04-2020T17:36:30,AspiringNoodle,"I've heard that 60 hour weeks aren't that uncommon in the industry, but it's more or less because the artists choose tos pend that much time."
20-04-2020T17:36:51,CrimsonQuill,@AspiringNoodle I don't think I'd ever make a full time artist
20-04-2020T17:37:06,CrimsonQuill,I just do it as a hobby
20-04-2020T17:37:13,CrimsonQuill,And I do want to be a surveyor.
20-04-2020T17:37:21,CrimsonQuill,"Seriously, the things that can be done w"
20-04-2020T17:37:23,AspiringNoodle,I'm trying to cut back my time wasters (and winning / losing?) to free up time.
20-04-2020T17:37:32,CrimsonQuill,with rasters and point clouds are amazing!
20-04-2020T17:37:46,CrimsonQuill,@AspiringNoodle think you have time wasters?
20-04-2020T17:37:51,CrimsonQuill,I have so many myself
20-04-2020T17:38:50,AspiringNoodle,"You do not want to hear my backlogs for: Youtube, videogames, anime, comics."
20-04-2020T17:39:10,CrimsonQuill,"You don't want to hear mine, either."
20-04-2020T17:39:15,SonOfGoku,Those lists are big
20-04-2020T17:39:23,CrimsonQuill,There's too much to see.
20-04-2020T17:39:26,CrimsonQuill,Too little time.
20-04-2020T17:39:52,AspiringNoodle,Part of it's me
20-04-2020T17:40:06,AspiringNoodle,I can obsess over something that's about to come out and enter a very passive waiting state
20-04-2020T17:40:20,AspiringNoodle,"And trust me, I am VERY patient, lol"
20-04-2020T17:40:55,AspiringNoodle,"This alone can lead to time wasting by constantly refreshing for updates, looking for more info on the subject, etc."
20-04-2020T17:42:01,CrimsonQuill,Well.
20-04-2020T17:42:06,CrimsonQuill,I make a plan to do something
20-04-2020T17:42:29,CrimsonQuill,"but either distract myself on mindless searching on the internet, just to satisfy the 10 second attention span"
20-04-2020T17:42:39,CrimsonQuill,Or play a videogame but waste time doing nothing in it
20-04-2020T17:42:51,AspiringNoodle,Lol.  My woW sub's about to lapse in 10 days
20-04-2020T17:43:09,CrimsonQuill,Ahaha
20-04-2020T17:43:14,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I need to head to bed"
20-04-2020T17:43:16,AspiringNoodle,"I just need to remember to do this dino weekly world boss for a chance at an alpaca mount, but other than that, I probably won't touch the game until Shadowlands"

20-04-2020T18:46:49,ThoseButterflys,this is a vsual representation of what you feel like with a hangover
20-04-2020T18:53:18,SpazztasticKiwi,why do I feel like you’re too young to know what a hangover is
20-04-2020T18:59:21,ThoseButterflys,because im 14
20-04-2020T18:59:48,ThoseButterflys,well I do i've seen my parents before
20-04-2020T19:02:28,ThoseButterflys,they had a fire going for about 5 hours 2 (1 quart) jars of moonshine and about 30 beers not including the fancy drinks my mom made all about 8 people in total
20-04-2020T19:04:21,ThoseButterflys,and is it bad that i can name a brand of alcohol just by the symbol
20-04-2020T19:04:27,ThoseButterflys,?
20-04-2020T19:27:03,RimaDraws,hiii
20-04-2020T19:38:47,ThoseButterflys,hello
20-04-2020T19:52:41,SpazztasticKiwi,someone shared a video of their raccoon washing their hands
20-04-2020T19:52:50,SpazztasticKiwi,a  r a c c o o n
20-04-2020T19:53:04,SpazztasticKiwi,we can’t get ~people~ to do that
20-04-2020T19:58:29,CrRAR,not only hands but they rinse off their food too
20-04-2020T20:06:19,SpazztasticKiwi,tiny hands do a washy wash
20-04-2020T20:06:57,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s said you should give a raccoon a sugar cube or cotton candy & watch
20-04-2020T20:09:00,CrRAR,"I've seen those, it kind of proves animals to some degree understand object permanence."
20-04-2020T20:09:54,CrRAR,They say when babies minds develop that's a major step in cognitive development knowing that something should still be there when hidden or whatever.
20-04-2020T20:17:39,AspiringNoodle,"Fun fact:  ""Washing"" is an instinctive behavior for raccoons"
20-04-2020T20:18:05,AspiringNoodle,"One so powerful that researchers couldn't even train it out of them.  Their attempts worked at first, but the raccoons quickly reverted back."

20-04-2020T22:14:05,FrSpaceWolf,I feel bad cus I really didnt need my stimulus check and I keep hearing of people needing it and not receiving anything...
20-04-2020T22:14:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"the usual, but the one on the stimulus check was very specific to say if I filed taxes 2018/2019 (I did) and sent them direct deposit (I did), it would show in the account I set up my tax deposit for 2018/2019"
20-04-2020T22:15:05,FrSpaceWolf,"also yeah, scammers have been going crazy with all this stuff going on"
20-04-2020T22:15:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"guys, my deposit dropped, I was just in the wrong account"

20-04-2020T22:17:07,FrSpaceWolf,"ooh, how u do that"
20-04-2020T22:17:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I review my account and history at least every month if not twice already
20-04-2020T22:17:40,SpazztasticKiwi,to check for odd buys and review purchases the bank can flag
20-04-2020T22:17:42,Ordithus,"at least in firefox, right click and go to view page info, then the media tab.  Anything someone's used should be there"
20-04-2020T22:17:55,FrSpaceWolf,"yeah I keep close track of mine, trying to keep it up so I can move next year. gtfo of this place.."

20-04-2020T22:18:39,SpazztasticKiwi,like when I preordered Toms book and it flagged because it was a Cincinnati purchase and my travel plans didn’t show me in or going there
20-04-2020T22:18:54,SpazztasticKiwi,& it’s too far away for me to happen to be there buying something
20-04-2020T22:19:07,FrSpaceWolf,ah
20-04-2020T22:19:43,CrRAR,"Yeah some banks are overprotective, rightly so."
20-04-2020T22:19:58,CrRAR,Some people find that comforting though
20-04-2020T22:20:27,FrSpaceWolf,ye
20-04-2020T22:20:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d rather it be than to have someone swipe my card somehow and buy up a clothes store and the bank be like “yeah sure that’s fine”
20-04-2020T22:20:52,Ordithus,like all the gas in texas
20-04-2020T22:20:55,FrSpaceWolf,I just have my stuff set up so every time theres a purchase it notifies my phone. pretty hard for someone to purchase a buncha stuff lol
20-04-2020T22:22:06,SpazztasticKiwi,last night I saw where a lady found out a cashier at her town starbucks got a copy of her card when she walked off with it to “get receipt paper”
20-04-2020T22:22:06,FrSpaceWolf,"could be annoying for some, but i dont get a lot of stuff so."
20-04-2020T22:22:28,CrRAR,dang swindlers
20-04-2020T22:22:35,FrSpaceWolf,bulllll
20-04-2020T22:22:38,FrSpaceWolf,that sucks
20-04-2020T22:22:41,SpazztasticKiwi,her bank texted her later that $212 was charged in groceries at a local kroger
20-04-2020T22:23:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"so she called the bank and store to say that wasn’t her, and get the camera feed and charge reversed"
20-04-2020T22:23:26,SpazztasticKiwi,then called starbucks corporate and the police
20-04-2020T22:23:59,CrRAR,karmic justice
20-04-2020T22:24:58,CrRAR,"yeah, just claiming to a bank/cc company that a charge wasn't you is enough to reverse it these days, even better if you can thwart bad behavior."
20-04-2020T22:26:28,FrSpaceWolf,"omg firefox worked, thanks again"

20-04-2020T23:02:35,FrSpaceWolf,honestly this is one of the few chances I get to grow out my beard so i havent been shaving..
20-04-2020T23:02:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"either that because they don’t or can’t go out, they’re going full caveman"
20-04-2020T23:02:54,FrSpaceWolf,"mil wont let me, and I havent been working for a while now.."

20-04-2020T23:15:31,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:
20-04-2020T23:16:20,SpazztasticKiwi,should’ve seen the oil pan from the video
20-04-2020T23:16:38,SpazztasticKiwi,molded to the pan
20-04-2020T23:16:49,CrRAR,"hey, looks like their lava cake is done!"
20-04-2020T23:17:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"sealed so close, the writing in the metal was indented in the stuff"
20-04-2020T23:17:21,SpazztasticKiwi,it was like jello
20-04-2020T23:18:07,FrSpaceWolf,I wonder what they added that they werent supposed to
20-04-2020T23:18:11,Ordithus,is that what happens when you go 200k miles without an oil change?
20-04-2020T23:18:15,SpazztasticKiwi,but they never said what it was or what happened - all you got was it was the worst case any of the workers had seen and they wondered how it hadn’t seized up before the lady brought it in
20-04-2020T23:18:27,FrSpaceWolf,feel like they added cooking oil or something stupid
20-04-2020T23:19:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I have seen the result of a woman putting windshield fluid in the oil port
20-04-2020T23:19:36,SpazztasticKiwi,jelly like pink stuff
20-04-2020T23:19:55,SpazztasticKiwi,all. in. the engine
20-04-2020T23:20:15,CrRAR,Some cars if the radiator goes bad will leak coolant into the engine oil.
20-04-2020T23:20:24,SpazztasticKiwi,but sorta like plastic too - sort of a slime semi solid
20-04-2020T23:20:46,FrSpaceWolf,"during one of my oil changed, they added coolant to my car and used the wrong kind......long story short they wouldnt cover it either and I had to go somewhere else to flush the whole coolant system.."
20-04-2020T23:21:05,FrSpaceWolf,"was not a good time for me, dont go to car shops around here anymore"
20-04-2020T23:21:58,FrSpaceWolf,"incase anyone doesnt know, u mix the wrong kinds of coolant and it turns into gel in ur car"

20-04-2020T23:22:39,CrRAR,yeah that sucks
20-04-2020T23:25:21,CrRAR,"yeah coolant is one of those things that needs matching, there's anti oxidating properties and each radiator is potentially made of different metals"

20-04-2020T23:42:33,CrRAR,"I don't get how you do that, the nozzles are different sizes."
20-04-2020T23:43:09,CrRAR,She may have been trying to kill it to get a new car. xD
20-04-2020T23:43:49,CrRAR,At least that's what I'm hoping was her master plan.
