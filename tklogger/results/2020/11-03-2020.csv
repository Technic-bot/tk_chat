11-03-2020T14:35:53,CrRAR,haha yeah and spazz
11-03-2020T14:36:39,CrRAR,Retail probably has the potential to steer you one way or the complete opposite in that respect.

11-03-2020T22:42:38,AspiringNoodle,"Noods is here with a ""life in retail"" update :ptv-snicker:"
11-03-2020T22:58:33,SonOfGoku,Hi Noodle
11-03-2020T22:59:36,AspiringNoodle,"Hello, fellow hat <3"
11-03-2020T23:00:08,SonOfGoku,How was your day?
11-03-2020T23:06:40,AspiringNoodle,*looks at clock*
11-03-2020T23:06:44,AspiringNoodle,How much time you got? lol
11-03-2020T23:07:16,SonOfGoku,I got enough
11-03-2020T23:07:29,AspiringNoodle,Biggest complaint first
11-03-2020T23:07:50,AspiringNoodle,"New company is using different software for certification, and they want everyone certified under it.  Doesn't matter when you got your old one."
11-03-2020T23:08:10,AspiringNoodle,"At best, you got a week's notice that you need to have it done by tomorrow to be eligible to continue working"
11-03-2020T23:09:19,AspiringNoodle,So I'm gonna be spending an extra three hours or more tonight / tomorrow morning to be recertified for tobacco / alcohol sales.  And I got alcohol certified only a few months ago
11-03-2020T23:09:54,AspiringNoodle,And I'm gonna stop there or else I might end up pissing my self off into handing my two weeks in tomorrow xD
11-03-2020T23:10:41,SonOfGoku,Sorry to hear that but I hope things get better soon
11-03-2020T23:11:17,AspiringNoodle,"S'okay, I might call off saturday, turn my 4 day weekend into a 5 day @w@"
11-03-2020T23:11:34,SonOfGoku,Have they at least hired more people?
11-03-2020T23:11:59,AspiringNoodle,"yes, but I keep thinking, ""Hire one or two more part timers.  If we get into that situation again, do NOT count on me to pull extra days consistently."""
11-03-2020T23:15:13,SonOfGoku,At least they‚Äôre trying but they never should have let it get to that point
11-03-2020T23:16:15,AspiringNoodle,That's what happens when you have 2 full timers leave in a span of 2 weeks
11-03-2020T23:16:44,AspiringNoodle,And then have part timers already soaking up all the hours they want get more pushed onto them
11-03-2020T23:17:22,AspiringNoodle,"Doesn't help that corporate more or less has the store running at minimum capacity, so we don't have room to go lower :/"
11-03-2020T23:18:55,AspiringNoodle,"Legit, when I first started, 2nd shift had 3 people on it, the odd day or two we might have 2, but we had some wiggle room"
11-03-2020T23:19:13,AspiringNoodle,Now it's 2. Period.  And one of them will be left alone for 1.5 - 2 hours before night shift comes in to take over.
11-03-2020T23:20:01,SonOfGoku,"That‚Äôs the main problem with retail, corporate doesn‚Äôt understand how to run things"
11-03-2020T23:20:23,AspiringNoodle,What's crazier is that they wanted us to cut the store hours even further
11-03-2020T23:20:32,AspiringNoodle,Even though we're at this point with what we're using.
11-03-2020T23:22:35,AspiringNoodle,"Anyone want to place bets on how long before my complaints become ""I gave them my 2 weeks.""? c:"
11-03-2020T23:23:58,SonOfGoku,2 months
11-03-2020T23:26:25,AspiringNoodle,Let's see :P
11-03-2020T23:27:12,SonOfGoku,Hopefully you can last as long as you need to work there
11-03-2020T23:30:23,AspiringNoodle,"If anything, this place will kill my procrastination tendencies"
11-03-2020T23:30:34,AspiringNoodle,"""Encourage"" me to find a programming job"
11-03-2020T23:30:52,AspiringNoodle,Likely after I put in my 2 weeks xD
11-03-2020T23:32:37,SonOfGoku,That‚Äôs a good way to look at it
11-03-2020T23:36:19,AspiringNoodle,"Because, imo, $9.50 an hour is not worth the stress / frustration it causes"
11-03-2020T23:37:11,SonOfGoku,That‚Äôs better than what my sister makes at the local movie theater
11-03-2020T23:37:42,AspiringNoodle,What's she make?
11-03-2020T23:38:08,AspiringNoodle,"Because, even with that wage, we have a hard time hiring / keeping people.  I'm one of the few young employees whose lasted as long as I have"
11-03-2020T23:38:20,SonOfGoku,Something around $8 but I don‚Äôt know the exact amount
11-03-2020T23:38:44,AspiringNoodle,We even recently had a new hire who decided not to accept the position.  Quit before the training period was up.
11-03-2020T23:55:31,SonOfGoku,How is your other job going?
11-03-2020T23:58:18,AspiringNoodle,"Is going.  A lot slower than I'd like, but I like my boss and it's a startup, so what can you do? xD"
11-03-2020T23:58:56,AspiringNoodle,Got work coming this sunday (another reason considering calling off on saturday)
