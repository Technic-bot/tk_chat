11-09-2020T01:27:20,Ordithus,you know what you did
11-09-2020T01:27:25,Werewing,"Mark is Tom's Bro, so we should be familiar with piggies by now."

11-09-2020T01:28:35,SpazztasticKiwi,but also yes
11-09-2020T01:34:17,FenceEqualizer,"I can't hear this song without immediately going to the ""To be continue"" meme."
11-09-2020T01:35:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I have my own list goin so “spooky scary skeletons” would make a different to be continued meme for sure
11-09-2020T01:36:49,FoxxTrotter,"I'm off to bed. G'night, everyone. :0)"
11-09-2020T01:37:02,FenceEqualizer,"Spooky scary ske...""Roundabout starts playing."""

11-09-2020T01:39:30,SpazztasticKiwi,unless you’re talking the road roundabout
11-09-2020T01:39:41,SageSaga,the song playing on my stream atm
11-09-2020T01:39:47,FenceEqualizer,^
11-09-2020T01:40:04,FenceEqualizer,"It's the song that plays during the ""To be continued"" meme"
11-09-2020T01:40:06,SpazztasticKiwi,👌🏻
11-09-2020T01:41:03,SpazztasticKiwi,speaking of memes anyone know the name of the one with every female avenger vs thanos over peter parker
11-09-2020T01:41:51,CrRAR,:spider::sweat_drops:
11-09-2020T01:42:05,CrRAR,those are spider tears
11-09-2020T01:42:42,FenceEqualizer,Havn't seen the meme so can't help you on that one unfortunately.
11-09-2020T01:42:52,Ordithus,is there a FFT remake yet
11-09-2020T01:43:03,FenceEqualizer,No and it's a crime that there isn't.
11-09-2020T01:43:09,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-LauraCry:
11-09-2020T01:43:10,FenceEqualizer,And no I don't count the psp as a remake.
11-09-2020T01:43:39,SageSaga,there is another remake that should also not count
11-09-2020T01:44:29,SageSaga,the iOS and Android remake
11-09-2020T01:44:55,FenceEqualizer,Those too. Though they're like a port of the psp version...or maybe vice versa.
11-09-2020T01:45:30,ZRO4825,Nyna butt
11-09-2020T01:45:48,FenceEqualizer,All I know is it sucks as the sound effects lag behind the animations dramatically
11-09-2020T01:45:51,Ordithus,:eyes:
11-09-2020T01:46:29,Dadrobit,Back
11-09-2020T01:46:55,Dadrobit,Successfully killed the mosquito that'd been assaulting me all night.
11-09-2020T01:46:59,SageSaga,how did you knooooow? XD
11-09-2020T01:47:31,ZRO4825,Viewer's intuition! >:3
11-09-2020T01:48:30,Dadrobit,God FFT was such a good game. Best story of a FF game by a good mile or three imho
11-09-2020T01:48:48,SageSaga,agreed
11-09-2020T01:48:49,FenceEqualizer,Welcome back and true.
11-09-2020T01:49:02,SageSaga,i wanna play it again but they gotta make it run better on PC
11-09-2020T01:50:04,FenceEqualizer,Delita growth from nobody to king was amazing. Honestly wanted a side story of his adventures.
11-09-2020T01:50:56,Ordithus,I will never not be sad my original copy freezes after the intro battle... wonder if it is actually my ps2
11-09-2020T01:51:10,Dadrobit,"Oh man, that's horrible"
11-09-2020T01:51:19,FenceEqualizer,That sucks.
11-09-2020T01:51:26,Dadrobit,Almost certainly the disc though
11-09-2020T01:51:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I found the meme!!
11-09-2020T01:51:31,FenceEqualizer,Sounds like a disc problem.
11-09-2020T01:51:38,Dadrobit,PS1 discs were ass
11-09-2020T01:51:40,Ordithus,"maybe, the ps2 has had issues with other games"
11-09-2020T01:51:50,FenceEqualizer,Those disc reaallllly hate scratches.
11-09-2020T01:52:01,Dadrobit,My FF8 disc froze right after the second disc started.
11-09-2020T01:52:44,FenceEqualizer,Had that issue with FF7
11-09-2020T01:53:12,FenceEqualizer,Surprisingly toothpaste fixed it. I don't know how. Still think it was a fluke.
11-09-2020T01:53:20,SpazztasticKiwi,only took 100 searches but I found the meme
11-09-2020T01:53:33,Ordithus,that is dedication
11-09-2020T01:53:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I need to find the meme base
11-09-2020T01:54:12,SpazztasticKiwi,but I don’t know the name and this is the only form I know to reference
11-09-2020T01:54:26,Dadrobit,I remember there was a million and rumors on the schoolyard on how to fix PS issues.
11-09-2020T01:54:41,Dadrobit,Million and one rumors*
11-09-2020T01:54:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I show when stream done
11-09-2020T01:55:05,FenceEqualizer,Wipe the lens. Push the lens all the way back. Pull the lens all the way forward.
11-09-2020T01:55:07,Dadrobit,(PS5 hype tho)
11-09-2020T01:55:21,Dadrobit,Put an ice pack under the console
11-09-2020T01:56:02,FenceEqualizer,Start the game with the disc tray up then close it as the system loads.
11-09-2020T01:56:30,FenceEqualizer,Also Sony needs to hurry up with the ps5 prices!
11-09-2020T01:56:55,SpazztasticKiwi,indentured servitude
11-09-2020T01:57:23,ZRO4825,"Gotta admit I'd like to see some more info on PS5. Need to know how much I need to hold back for it, lol"
11-09-2020T01:58:05,Dadrobit,$499 at most
11-09-2020T01:58:20,SpazztasticKiwi,my sister does nothing else but ps
11-09-2020T01:58:29,SpazztasticKiwi,last price I saw $700
11-09-2020T01:58:39,Dadrobit,"Also, as a mild audiophile, I cannot freaking wait to see what becomes of the Tempest Engine."
11-09-2020T01:58:58,Ordithus,does it do the dishes at that price
11-09-2020T01:59:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I feckin better but I doubt it
11-09-2020T01:59:22,SpazztasticKiwi,better babysit n clean the house too
11-09-2020T01:59:27,SpazztasticKiwi,and my taxes
11-09-2020T01:59:31,SageSaga,nah
11-09-2020T01:59:33,FenceEqualizer,No way will it be at $700.
11-09-2020T01:59:49,Dadrobit,"For better or worse, it'll definitely be used as a babysitter, I can guarantee that."
11-09-2020T01:59:53,SageSaga,y'all just need to join the PC side and spend upwards of a thousand dollars for peak gaming
11-09-2020T02:00:02,FenceEqualizer,My wallet weeps.
11-09-2020T02:00:05,Ordithus,peak haha
11-09-2020T02:00:11,ZRO4825,I already do that too. :V
11-09-2020T02:00:34,Dadrobit,"3800X and a 2070 Super, I get it. Still want my comfy PS fix."
11-09-2020T02:00:37,FenceEqualizer,Maybe if we get another stimulus. >.>
11-09-2020T02:00:44,Ordithus,Yeah I need to build a new pc...
11-09-2020T02:00:55,Ordithus,Half of mine is 2011 built for Skyrim
11-09-2020T02:01:02,SageSaga,Ord- the 3070 is coming out soooon
11-09-2020T02:01:18,FenceEqualizer,Isn't that like $500?
11-09-2020T02:01:26,FenceEqualizer,Or was that the 3080?
11-09-2020T02:01:29,ZRO4825,"I just got my 2070S not long ago, but I gotta admit, that 3070 is sounding delicious <3"
11-09-2020T02:01:34,SageSaga,500 dollars with the power of last years that was 1300
11-09-2020T02:01:38,Ordithus,I did upgrade it back in... 2016?  17?
11-09-2020T02:01:51,SpazztasticKiwi,so I got work in 8 hours
11-09-2020T02:02:10,SageSaga,a friend of mine recently got a 2080Ti he is pissed
11-09-2020T02:02:33,Dadrobit,"The 30 series looks incredible, but I already get all the frames already, I honestly can't justify the upgrade."
11-09-2020T02:02:34,FenceEqualizer,Might be bed time Kiwi.
11-09-2020T02:02:35,SageSaga,"""I have the best card on the market- and they they make the mid tier card more powerful and less than half the price!"""
11-09-2020T02:03:12,Dadrobit,Especially not with the PS5 in the next few months.
11-09-2020T02:03:14,FenceEqualizer,Damn that sucks for your friend.
11-09-2020T02:03:26,FenceEqualizer,Probably too late to sell it now too.
11-09-2020T02:03:29,SageSaga,the 2080Ti still beats the PS5
11-09-2020T02:03:43,Dadrobit,shrugs
11-09-2020T02:04:10,AspiringNoodle,"PS5 / Xbox One hyping intensifies: ""Haha, your stupid computers will never be as powerful as our new consoles!"""
11-09-2020T02:04:12,Dadrobit,Can't beat lying back just chilling with my feet over the edge of a couch on a big screen TV
11-09-2020T02:04:15,SageSaga,and the 3070 beats the 2080Ti by a good margin and price
11-09-2020T02:04:17,AspiringNoodle,"Ampere: ""Hold my raytracing."""
11-09-2020T02:05:10,Dadrobit,And the PS5 is still gonna be nearly as powerful as a 1080 TI. It's not like it's nothing. Throw in the insane SSD and I'm happy.
11-09-2020T02:05:48,SageSaga,the only thing the SSD does that is insane is bypass the cpu for faster GPU performance
11-09-2020T02:06:16,SageSaga,something all the new GPUs have now too sooooo- even with that one thing they finally had- they dont anymore
11-09-2020T02:06:22,AspiringNoodle,Also hardware level decoding of game files for near instantaneous load times :D
11-09-2020T02:06:25,FenceEqualizer,As long as it doesn't turn peoples rooms into an oven with it's loud fans.
11-09-2020T02:07:19,Dadrobit,"And adds a ton of data transfer paths, something like 12 compared to the standard 4. Shit will load info instantly."
11-09-2020T02:07:34,SageSaga,you have any idea how bad load times had to be for the PS5 to focus so hard on the new SSD? XD
11-09-2020T02:07:56,Ordithus,I think I'm a few years behind on tech aha
11-09-2020T02:08:06,Ordithus,last I remember ryzen came out
11-09-2020T02:08:16,FenceEqualizer,Anyone who played Monster Hunter world on ps4 knows how bad load times got.
11-09-2020T02:08:22,ZRO4825,3 letters can emphasize the loading problem for you.
11-09-2020T02:08:24,ZRO4825,MHW
11-09-2020T02:08:26,AspiringNoodle,"It's funny, tbh"
11-09-2020T02:08:27,SageSaga,omg it was hooorrrible
11-09-2020T02:08:39,ZRO4825,"Get outta mah head, Fence D:<"
11-09-2020T02:08:41,Dadrobit,"Yeah, that's why they focused on it and fixed it. What's the issue with that?"
11-09-2020T02:08:43,AspiringNoodle,They're going straight past the HDD to SSD upgrade
11-09-2020T02:08:51,FenceEqualizer,Neva :ptv-angry:
11-09-2020T02:08:52,SageSaga,wat
11-09-2020T02:08:53,AspiringNoodle,And going for a next-gen SSD upgrade
11-09-2020T02:09:02,SageSaga,they didnt skip HDD
11-09-2020T02:09:18,Dadrobit,HDD was the problem Noodle
11-09-2020T02:09:24,AspiringNoodle,...
11-09-2020T02:09:24,SageSaga,every PS4 came with a hard drive
11-09-2020T02:09:26,AspiringNoodle,Guys
11-09-2020T02:09:29,AspiringNoodle,re-read my statements
11-09-2020T02:09:31,AspiringNoodle,*slowly*
11-09-2020T02:09:47,SageSaga,you read it
11-09-2020T02:10:01,Dadrobit,Going straight past implies they never reached it in the first place.
11-09-2020T02:10:02,SageSaga,you said they are going straight past the HDD to SSD upgrade
11-09-2020T02:10:29,ZRO4825,I think something is being assumed to have been interpreted that was not interpreted as such. o.o;
11-09-2020T02:10:44,Ordithus,HDD --> fancy SSD instead of HDD --> basic SSD
11-09-2020T02:10:51,AspiringNoodle,^^^^^^^^ THANK YOU
11-09-2020T02:11:02,SageSaga,thats not what he said
11-09-2020T02:11:16,Ordithus,that is besides the point
11-09-2020T02:11:16,ZRO4825,"Okay, but ""Skipping the SSD"" insinuates that they somehow didn't use an SSD at all. ^^;"
11-09-2020T02:11:59,FenceEqualizer,It really helps that SSD's have become so much cheaper to make then when they first came out.
11-09-2020T02:12:22,ZRO4825,So much yes to that.
11-09-2020T02:12:31,ZRO4825,and M.2 drives now are disgustingly beautiful <3
11-09-2020T02:12:37,SageSaga,especially NVME
11-09-2020T02:13:30,SpazztasticKiwi,welp
11-09-2020T02:13:34,SpazztasticKiwi,ya did it

11-09-2020T02:14:56,DarthRexKing,o/
11-09-2020T02:15:11,Ordithus,pretty darn tired too
11-09-2020T02:15:30,Dadrobit,"Mmm yeah, I remember my first ssd was for my PS3 and prices had it at like $1.50+ per gig. Now you can get a TB for like $80."
11-09-2020T02:15:43,Dadrobit,o/ Spazz
11-09-2020T02:15:43,Ordithus,waaaaa
11-09-2020T02:15:50,ZRO4825,Ordered myself a BD/DVD copy of My Hero Academia: Two Heroes earlier today. Will be nice to see that. :3
11-09-2020T02:15:53,FenceEqualizer,Those prices where insane back then!
11-09-2020T02:16:06,Ordithus,my 256 gb ssd was so freakin expensive
11-09-2020T02:16:25,ZRO4825,"Yeah, I remember when 256GB SSD was insane, lol"
11-09-2020T02:16:41,Ordithus,whatever I build next is gonna blow my mind
11-09-2020T02:16:53,SageSaga,ive got a 500GB NVME in my current system- and like 8TB of HDD space
11-09-2020T02:16:57,ZRO4825,"First time loading Windows up on that thing was like ""Wait, I just shut it off!"""
11-09-2020T02:17:05,FenceEqualizer,O_O
11-09-2020T02:17:24,ZRO4825,"Sounds 'bout right, Sage, lol"
11-09-2020T02:17:37,FenceEqualizer,I'm computering wrong.
11-09-2020T02:17:50,ZRO4825,I need to get another 16GB of RAM for this setup
11-09-2020T02:18:08,FenceEqualizer,Then again I still have an Alienware X51 R1
11-09-2020T02:18:41,ZRO4825,oof
11-09-2020T02:18:44,ZRO4825,"I know that feel, lol"
11-09-2020T02:18:48,Ordithus,need more data
11-09-2020T02:18:55,ZRO4825,I had to break down and get a 4TB drive for Steam cuz my 2TB wasn't cutting it anymore. XD
11-09-2020T02:19:02,SageSaga,NEED MOAR DRIVES
11-09-2020T02:19:24,FenceEqualizer,Vergil?
11-09-2020T02:19:25,AspiringNoodle,2tb nvme boot drive for me :ptv-uneasy:
11-09-2020T02:19:41,SageSaga,my NVME is a 1TB not a 500
11-09-2020T02:19:48,AspiringNoodle,I went 2TB because that's the plug-n-play max storage for a drive holding the OS
11-09-2020T02:19:53,SageSaga,forgot it went on sale when i got it
11-09-2020T02:19:54,FenceEqualizer,Also how are you using so much space!? Is that mostly games?
11-09-2020T02:20:03,AspiringNoodle,Art :snail:
11-09-2020T02:20:07,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I was surprised how fast I managed to fill my first TB. When it became an option I remember thinking to my self."
11-09-2020T02:20:12,FenceEqualizer,:ptv-shock:
11-09-2020T02:20:23,Dadrobit,"""Holy cow, how could I ever fill a full TB???"""
11-09-2020T02:20:28,Ordithus,and here I am on about 750 gb total space
11-09-2020T02:20:29,AspiringNoodle,"Well, Sage has been doing art for years.  I can't imagine how much Tom is using"
11-09-2020T02:20:46,SageSaga,not sure if Tom would be using more than me-
11-09-2020T02:21:12,Ordithus,would be a pointless academic exercise
11-09-2020T02:21:34,ZRO4825,"Was gonna say, don't think Tom would be using more, lol"
11-09-2020T02:22:10,Dadrobit,"""pointless academic exercise"" I believe you mean pissing contest."
11-09-2020T02:22:11,FenceEqualizer,"I'm guessing, Art you've drawn, Comissions, References, those random photoshop pieces that was named ""aaaaaa"" on a busy day"
11-09-2020T02:22:30,AspiringNoodle,"I'm gonna want to get some HDD's at some point, lol"
11-09-2020T02:22:40,AspiringNoodle,"2TB nvme is *great* for OS, games, programs, etc"
11-09-2020T02:22:59,AspiringNoodle,Don't think storing art files (unless it's a current project) would be very useful :ptv-laugh:
11-09-2020T02:23:07,Ordithus,I 'member that 20 gb drive for the family computer
11-09-2020T02:23:12,Ordithus,we were never gonna fill that
11-09-2020T02:23:15,Dadrobit,Asdf.psd Asdf1.psd Asdf2.psd
11-09-2020T02:23:18,ZRO4825,XD
11-09-2020T02:23:31,FenceEqualizer,Robit gets it. :ptv-laugh:
11-09-2020T02:24:46,FenceEqualizer,Seriously that's such a bad habit to learn. I still got psd files I don't remember.
11-09-2020T02:24:50,Ordithus,my camera will fill 20 gb in 3 minutes
11-09-2020T02:25:00,SageSaga,Organized!
11-09-2020T02:25:20,Dadrobit,I definitely go full squalor-goblin on my naming convention sometimes. But I absolutely try to keep everything else versioned properly.
11-09-2020T02:25:38,AspiringNoodle,naisu sage
11-09-2020T02:25:51,AspiringNoodle,very C L E A N :ok_hand:
11-09-2020T02:25:52,FenceEqualizer,That's how it's done Sage! :ptv-victory:
11-09-2020T02:26:10,Dadrobit,"Clint name for the folder name, and date+version for all the saves."
11-09-2020T02:26:18,Dadrobit,Client*
11-09-2020T02:26:22,SageSaga,AI file is 30GBs
11-09-2020T02:26:38,Dadrobit,Make my life easier one save as at a time.
11-09-2020T02:26:42,SageSaga,commissions and patreon file is 20GBs
11-09-2020T02:27:20,AspiringNoodle,is that per file???
11-09-2020T02:27:23,Ordithus,Yosh!?
11-09-2020T02:27:33,SageSaga,yosh will crash if all in one file
11-09-2020T02:27:54,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, so like every page loaded into one file?"
11-09-2020T02:28:32,SageSaga,no
11-09-2020T02:29:29,SageSaga,each page has its own folder for Yosh to keep track of them easier by number rather than by date
11-09-2020T02:30:19,AspiringNoodle,"Sage, you are an inspiration to neat freaks everywhere :ptv-hearts:"
11-09-2020T02:30:57,SageSaga,and that is where you are WRONG
11-09-2020T02:31:08,SageSaga,the only thing organized in my life is my work!
11-09-2020T02:31:30,ZRO4825,"imo, that's the best thing to have organized"
11-09-2020T02:31:33,Dadrobit,"File names is the bare minimum of organization, noodle lmao"
11-09-2020T02:31:34,FenceEqualizer,Sometimes that's all that matters.
11-09-2020T02:31:58,Dadrobit,"The rest of my life is a mess, but at least I can date my work"
11-09-2020T02:32:53,FenceEqualizer,"9/1020 Oh wait I forgot the second ""/"" ehh I'll get back to it later."
11-09-2020T02:32:56,AspiringNoodle,*files nice and clean*
11-09-2020T02:33:01,AspiringNoodle,*house burning down around me*
11-09-2020T02:33:03,AspiringNoodle,"""This is fine."""
11-09-2020T02:33:05,SageSaga,man my pain is up to a 4 almost a 5 now
11-09-2020T02:33:08,Dadrobit,Can't use / in a file name
11-09-2020T02:33:21,FenceEqualizer,- then
11-09-2020T02:33:25,Dadrobit,9-10-20 will work tho
11-09-2020T02:34:22,Dadrobit,I 110% did try / early on in learning management and was dumbfounded why nothing was working
11-09-2020T02:35:21,AspiringNoodle,would likely confuse the file management system since / separates folders
11-09-2020T02:35:46,FenceEqualizer,I'm surprise you even got that far. PC usually throws a hissy fit if you try to use a format it doesn't like.
11-09-2020T02:37:03,Ordithus,":robot:*[I can't let you do that, Dave]"
11-09-2020T02:38:03,Dadrobit,Learned on a Mac
11-09-2020T02:38:36,AspiringNoodle,"Love the software, hardware can die in a ditch, haha"
11-09-2020T02:39:22,ZRO4825,.Hack <3
11-09-2020T02:39:48,FenceEqualizer,.hack VR when?
11-09-2020T02:40:27,ZRO4825,"I want SAO style full dive personally, lol"
11-09-2020T02:40:46,SageSaga,wasnt .hack full dive?
11-09-2020T02:40:48,Ordithus,no real death please and thanks
11-09-2020T02:41:12,FenceEqualizer,Was it? It's been so long since i've seen/play .hack I don't remember.
11-09-2020T02:41:36,FenceEqualizer,Also the moment we make Full dive a reality is the moment will temporarily collapse.
11-09-2020T02:42:22,ZRO4825,"From what I saw in the shows I managed to watch (didn't catch all of it) it was more of a VR headset with a controller deal, I believe"
11-09-2020T02:42:25,Dadrobit,Full Dive = Matrix level VR?
11-09-2020T02:42:29,SageSaga,im fairly certain .hack was full dive
11-09-2020T02:42:52,ZRO4825,Cuz I remember at one spot Mimiru left her seat and it left her character sittin there in a pose
11-09-2020T02:43:14,FenceEqualizer,Didn't they use controllers to play and control their characters?
11-09-2020T02:43:35,FenceEqualizer,Also yes Robit...except without plugging a giant needle into the back of your head.
11-09-2020T02:43:46,Dadrobit,Dang
11-09-2020T02:43:57,ZRO4825,"Yeah, I could do without the needle in the skull. :joy:"
11-09-2020T02:44:05,AspiringNoodle,.hack was the first manga / anime to present the idea of your mind being fully immersed / sealed into a game world
11-09-2020T02:44:26,AspiringNoodle,"SAO popularized the idea with the term ""full dive"""
11-09-2020T02:44:30,Dadrobit,I feel like that's a falsifiable statement
11-09-2020T02:44:31,ZRO4825,"Was it? I know it's the first one I knew of, but not sure the first."
11-09-2020T02:44:56,Dadrobit,"Like, there has to have been one before, at least one."
11-09-2020T02:45:01,FenceEqualizer,Looking it up on google and I keep seeing two different answers.
11-09-2020T02:45:18,ZRO4825,I know it definitely seemed to popularize the idea.
11-09-2020T02:45:20,FenceEqualizer,Lawn mower man
11-09-2020T02:45:31,Ordithus,"I'm heading to bed, good night! Thanks for the stream Sage!"
11-09-2020T02:45:39,ZRO4825,"Have a good one, Ord~"
11-09-2020T02:45:40,Dadrobit,o/ Ord
11-09-2020T02:45:42,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
11-09-2020T02:45:43,SageSaga,take care Ord
11-09-2020T02:45:45,FenceEqualizer,Have a good night Ord!
11-09-2020T02:46:06,SageSaga,yeah it had to be full dive- how else does it cause people to get trapped in the game?
11-09-2020T02:47:25,AspiringNoodle,"If we're going to be very specific about terms and such, .hack was likely the first big project to introduce the idea to a large audience"
11-09-2020T02:47:30,AspiringNoodle,And SAO was the one that gave it a term
11-09-2020T02:48:14,FenceEqualizer,True enough. Would be hard to imagine someone getting trapped in a game if they where using VR.
11-09-2020T02:48:30,AspiringNoodle,So here's the *big* question
11-09-2020T02:48:39,FenceEqualizer,Going to assume .hack was Full dive until proven otherwise.
11-09-2020T02:48:45,AspiringNoodle,"If full dive ever becomes a thing, will your standard video game experience manage to survive?"
11-09-2020T02:48:57,SageSaga,yes
11-09-2020T02:49:00,ZRO4825,"Probably, yes"
11-09-2020T02:49:05,FenceEqualizer,As a QA tester. I would hate it.
11-09-2020T02:49:06,SageSaga,but you will play them in Full dive houses
11-09-2020T02:49:19,AspiringNoodle,...so you'd play video games inside of video games? xD
11-09-2020T02:49:22,SageSaga,yes
11-09-2020T02:49:26,AspiringNoodle,...SIGN ME UP
11-09-2020T02:49:28,SageSaga,we already do it all the time
11-09-2020T02:49:35,SageSaga,minigames in our games bro
11-09-2020T02:49:55,AspiringNoodle,"Ugh, I'm getting flashbacks to stupid turtles in wow..."
11-09-2020T02:50:23,Werewing,Some games are nothing but minigames.
11-09-2020T02:50:32,Werewing,Like Mario Party.
11-09-2020T02:50:47,FenceEqualizer,Mario Party is war.
11-09-2020T02:51:59,SageSaga,i think the big part of Fulldive will be if they can manipulate the perception of time to make games super sped up- stretching an hour gaming session into feeling like 4 hours
11-09-2020T02:53:22,FenceEqualizer,That would be a huge problem if they didn't. There's already stories of gamers playing games to death in gaming cafes. I can see people practically living in full dive.
11-09-2020T02:53:29,SageSaga,because then it could be used for virtual schooling and virtual work-
11-09-2020T02:53:29,Werewing,gn
11-09-2020T02:53:39,FenceEqualizer,Night Werewing
11-09-2020T02:53:45,SageSaga,gnight Werewing
11-09-2020T02:53:46,petricolor,is this the same singer as the steins;gate OP
11-09-2020T02:53:58,AspiringNoodle,"Sage, you might have solved the problem of ""not enough time for games"""
11-09-2020T02:54:04,Dadrobit,o/ were
11-09-2020T02:54:15,AspiringNoodle,night
11-09-2020T02:54:19,FenceEqualizer,Though....if I could learn how to draw at 4x the speed in Full Dive...
11-09-2020T02:54:23,Dadrobit,They'll sell speed ups as microtransactions
11-09-2020T02:54:31,AspiringNoodle,"Oooo, Fence, that's also true~"
11-09-2020T02:54:40,AspiringNoodle,Fast track your skill development
11-09-2020T02:54:50,FenceEqualizer,Robit...do you work for EA?
11-09-2020T02:55:14,petricolor,plot twist your muscle memory doesn't work with your art skills when you come out
11-09-2020T02:55:27,petricolor,so you can only draw at your full potential when you're in full dlve
11-09-2020T02:55:52,AspiringNoodle,"plot twist, muscle memory isn't in your muscles, is in your brain ;P"
11-09-2020T02:55:55,Dadrobit,"Nah, I just assume the worst."
11-09-2020T02:56:02,AspiringNoodle,^ A wise man indeed
11-09-2020T02:56:34,FenceEqualizer,Can't wait to have ads blasted into my memory while in Full dive.
11-09-2020T02:56:53,SageSaga,extreme version of VR time manipulation - Jail - you have to serve a lifetime in jail- at 100x speed so hopefully the jail program reforms properly unlike real jail
11-09-2020T02:57:08,AspiringNoodle,"Oooooo, that would also be good~"
11-09-2020T02:57:23,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, the American prison system has soooooooo many effing problems :/"
11-09-2020T02:57:55,Dadrobit,Brb
11-09-2020T02:57:59,AspiringNoodle,"Biggest one being that it does nothing to reform, thrusts many burdens upon people after being released, and does nothing to protect them from discrimination / stigma"
11-09-2020T02:58:26,AspiringNoodle,I know there's a lawyer who is trying to remove the box from job applications
11-09-2020T02:59:13,FenceEqualizer,the box?
11-09-2020T02:59:38,SageSaga,"""have you been convicted of a crime"""
11-09-2020T02:59:54,AspiringNoodle,It's a catch 22 in its purest form
11-09-2020T02:59:57,FenceEqualizer,Ahhhh okay.
11-09-2020T02:59:58,MatyMaty,"I wonder if an hyper realistic VR version of Hell would be ""cruel and unusual punishment"" it used to punish crimes :P"
11-09-2020T03:00:05,AspiringNoodle,"If you answer ""yes"", most businesses will just trash your application right then and there"
11-09-2020T03:00:14,SageSaga,definitely- and howdy Maty!
11-09-2020T03:00:26,MatyMaty,o/
11-09-2020T03:00:26,AspiringNoodle,"But if you *don't* answer yes, they'll find out rather quickly that you did *indeed* commit a crime, and lied to them"
11-09-2020T03:00:32,FenceEqualizer,That sounds like a Black Mirror episode.
11-09-2020T03:00:35,AspiringNoodle,And trash your application right then and there
11-09-2020T03:01:05,AspiringNoodle,"And for most people getting out of prison, they're doing so on parole for good behavior, and a big part of that is that they need to find employment.  If they can't get a job, they go right back to jail"
11-09-2020T03:01:16,AspiringNoodle,"So, you see the problem."
11-09-2020T03:01:57,AspiringNoodle,"Our prison system is hardly about reforming criminals, it's about keeping them in the system. Forever."
11-09-2020T03:02:08,ZRO4825,Heyyo Maty ^^/
11-09-2020T03:02:14,MatyMaty,I also saw a tweet about having a kill switch in that Elon Musk brain processor thing
11-09-2020T03:02:19,SageSaga,but if we can get 4x our normal time out of using VR imagine how much stuff we could fix- people could do so much more work- have time for their families more - even relatively poor people who could afford it could seemingly live in luxury
11-09-2020T03:02:28,MatyMaty,and every time you commit ANY crime it advances a little
11-09-2020T03:02:41,AspiringNoodle,Links maty? :D
11-09-2020T03:02:45,AspiringNoodle,Am curious noodle now
11-09-2020T03:02:54,MatyMaty,and if you reach a limit you just die
11-09-2020T03:03:07,SageSaga,yeah that would be super illegal
11-09-2020T03:03:27,FenceEqualizer,Honestly a lot of good would come from 4x our normal time. Hell one of the problems with adulthood is that you lose a lot of time.
11-09-2020T03:03:27,AspiringNoodle,"Makes me think if Psycho-Pass, in a way"
11-09-2020T03:03:29,MatyMaty,"oh, it was a few days ago Noodle"
11-09-2020T03:04:08,FenceEqualizer,Again that sounds like a black Mirror episode. Or a Netflix movie.
11-09-2020T03:04:30,MatyMaty,"okay, question. Lets say you have that thing in your brain. And you can download any knownledge you want, Matrix style. But you are only allowed to have 3 things"
11-09-2020T03:04:43,MatyMaty,what do you pick?
11-09-2020T03:05:12,SageSaga,knowledge or skills?
11-09-2020T03:05:19,MatyMaty,both
11-09-2020T03:06:20,SageSaga,hmm- im mostly thinking- nothing- i dont think i would- the the knowledge that existed of something i liked- would just make that subject boring to me
11-09-2020T03:06:49,SageSaga,and developing a skill is what makes it unique
11-09-2020T03:07:36,MatyMaty,"Sage you wouldn't pick ""landscape drawing"" and never worry about backgrounds ever again? XD"
11-09-2020T03:07:46,SageSaga,nope
11-09-2020T03:07:58,MatyMaty,"oh right, that would be Ron :P"
11-09-2020T03:07:58,petricolor,"Ah but it doesn't have to be something you like, does it? I'd personally pick things I *don't* like that are useful"
11-09-2020T03:08:05,MatyMaty,you do like to draw backgrounds
11-09-2020T03:08:06,SageSaga,i can enjoy drawing them even when im bad at them- and the process of getting better at them is fun for me
11-09-2020T03:08:19,AspiringNoodle,"""minimal-effort big money, how to make amazing tasting healthy food, how to be elon musk"""
11-09-2020T03:08:20,FenceEqualizer,"Coding, Art, Writing. Got some games I would love to make while yeah it would take away from it some I think I would love to have a foundation to start from so I can create properly without hitting a wall the way I do."
11-09-2020T03:08:22,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-laugh:
11-09-2020T03:08:41,AspiringNoodle,I kid though.  I'm a very indecisive person.  I doubt I could ever pick 3 things
11-09-2020T03:08:46,Dakina,Ello
11-09-2020T03:08:49,petricolor,"For example: I'd pick coding, repairs/remodeling, and self defense"
11-09-2020T03:08:49,AspiringNoodle,o/
11-09-2020T03:08:53,SageSaga,Oh- actually Fence nailed it
11-09-2020T03:09:01,SageSaga,Languages and programming 100%
11-09-2020T03:09:15,ZRO4825,"Problem is, with stuff that's considered a skill, like say, art. What do you learn? Basics? Advanced technique? If so, WHO do you learn the advanced techniques of?"
11-09-2020T03:09:23,ZRO4825,What style?
11-09-2020T03:09:27,petricolor,I considered Japanese but i agree with you Sage in that the process is what makes it fun
11-09-2020T03:09:45,petricolor,I however
11-09-2020T03:09:52,petricolor,hate coding but it's useful and I want to know it
11-09-2020T03:09:55,MatyMaty,I'd pick automobile mechanics for starters
11-09-2020T03:09:58,petricolor,I don't want to learn it I want to KNOW it
11-09-2020T03:10:02,SageSaga,i have no interest in learning the complexities of so many different languages - so i would totally take those for free
11-09-2020T03:10:15,MatyMaty,so I can fix my car on my own
11-09-2020T03:10:21,petricolor,automobile stuff is why i said repairs/remodeling
11-09-2020T03:10:27,petricolor,"partially, at least"
11-09-2020T03:10:40,MatyMaty,well you have to be more specific Petri
11-09-2020T03:10:54,AspiringNoodle,"Coding would actually be a big one, now that I think about..."
11-09-2020T03:10:59,AspiringNoodle,"I agree, too many dang languages"
11-09-2020T03:11:15,petricolor,"Do I? Because I was trying to lump plumbing, electrician work, carpentry, and mechanic work together"
11-09-2020T03:11:32,petricolor,I just wanna be able to fix shit
11-09-2020T03:11:33,petricolor,on my own
11-09-2020T03:11:46,MatyMaty,"mechanics, medicine and one martial art I think"
11-09-2020T03:11:53,ZRO4825,"That also brings up the question, how large a scope is all considered one ""skill""?"
11-09-2020T03:12:28,AspiringNoodle,Coding is easier to quantiy
11-09-2020T03:12:40,MatyMaty,"a skill could be like, carpentry, or karate, or coding"
11-09-2020T03:12:45,AspiringNoodle,"You'd know the languages, their syntax, their limits, etc"
11-09-2020T03:12:48,SageSaga,probably like a school subject
11-09-2020T03:12:49,MatyMaty,"if you might, think of a ""job"""
11-09-2020T03:13:02,AspiringNoodle,Where you'd have room to grow is what you do with that knowledge
11-09-2020T03:13:13,petricolor,"but my question is, how is ""coding"" any different in scope than ""repairs"" as there are many programming languages"
11-09-2020T03:13:18,AspiringNoodle,"For example, Hello World is the first program you ever right"
11-09-2020T03:13:27,AspiringNoodle,"But you can make a really complex way of doing a basic job, lol"
11-09-2020T03:13:35,SageSaga,so if you pick something like Calculus- you would get all the stuff you need leading up to it- but you might not have the ins and outs of Trig because its not required
11-09-2020T03:13:37,MatyMaty,"because you don't hire a plumber to fix your car, Petri"
11-09-2020T03:13:50,MatyMaty,or a mechanic to make a wood closet
11-09-2020T03:14:23,petricolor,I mean you don't hire an obgyn to get your tonsils removed
11-09-2020T03:14:26,petricolor,so medicine is out
11-09-2020T03:14:34,MatyMaty,I guess one BAD think I could wish for
11-09-2020T03:14:48,MatyMaty,is the ability to copycat any artist I wanted :P
11-09-2020T03:15:23,SageSaga,steal my style and draw porn and make it look like its mine?! why would you even think of such a thing?!
11-09-2020T03:15:59,MatyMaty,so I can sell lewds to Zro
11-09-2020T03:16:12,SageSaga,seems about right
11-09-2020T03:16:15,MatyMaty,XD
11-09-2020T03:17:42,ZRO4825,:3
11-09-2020T03:17:51,FenceEqualizer,Pfft. :ptv-laugh:
11-09-2020T03:18:07,ZRO4825,It's like people know I'm all 'bout the boobies or something around here. O_O
11-09-2020T03:18:09,SageSaga,guess im lucky you dont have time to draw much
11-09-2020T03:19:10,MatyMaty,I've seen your requests Zro. There's usually a common theme to them :P
11-09-2020T03:19:42,ZRO4825,:ptv-uneasy:
11-09-2020T03:19:53,MatyMaty,"I do wonder tho, if that was a thing, would artists do the same as some writers do when they hire ""ghosts""?"
11-09-2020T03:20:09,MatyMaty,"""Draw this, I say I made it and we ho half and half on the payment"""
11-09-2020T03:20:28,ZRO4825,:thinking:
11-09-2020T03:20:37,SageSaga,i might need a ghost for if i do this big project
11-09-2020T03:20:49,MatyMaty,actually I thin Picasso or Dali actually did that :P
11-09-2020T03:20:50,SageSaga,because this book series does have several sex scenes
11-09-2020T03:20:50,ZRO4825,"....for some reason, Sage, that face on screen right now made me think of Tenchi Muyo."
11-09-2020T03:21:11,ZRO4825,And I have no logical explanation for that.
11-09-2020T03:21:25,SageSaga,i can see it too Zro
11-09-2020T03:21:35,MatyMaty,"found one person did perfect counterfeits, and instead of taking them to court, hired them to paint stuff and only add their signature when it was done"
11-09-2020T03:22:00,ZRO4825,That honestly wouldn't surprise me.
11-09-2020T03:22:19,petricolor,is this rwby music
11-09-2020T03:22:23,SageSaga,yes
11-09-2020T03:22:27,MatyMaty,"Sage, I told you , make A.I ""blue rays"""
11-09-2020T03:22:39,MatyMaty,and sell them as image sets :D
11-09-2020T03:22:50,petricolor,I don't watch rwby but that singer's voice is unmistakable
11-09-2020T03:23:11,SageSaga,so what you really mean is - draw the scene of Nyna and Kaylin having sex in the tent and sell it as DLC
11-09-2020T03:23:20,ZRO4825,XD
11-09-2020T03:23:24,FenceEqualizer,Okay sorry to interuppt but what is the name of this song?
11-09-2020T03:23:47,SageSaga,current or previous?
11-09-2020T03:23:51,FenceEqualizer,Previous
11-09-2020T03:24:00,ZRO4825,This is a different version of this one than what I have. :thinking:
11-09-2020T03:24:25,SageSaga,Previous was called The Triumph by Jeff Williams
11-09-2020T03:24:41,MatyMaty,Yes Sage :P
11-09-2020T03:24:52,MatyMaty,sell the uncensored versions
11-09-2020T03:25:09,FenceEqualizer,Thanks Sage! That song was getting me hyped.
11-09-2020T03:25:17,SageSaga,np
11-09-2020T03:25:33,SageSaga,oh Maty you dont know about the new project yet
11-09-2020T03:25:47,MatyMaty,new project? :
11-09-2020T03:25:50,MatyMaty,:O
11-09-2020T03:26:03,SageSaga,you know how i got my comics printed?
11-09-2020T03:26:22,MatyMaty,Kickstarter? :thinking:
11-09-2020T03:26:32,SageSaga,my kickstarter failed
11-09-2020T03:26:39,ZRO4825,"Close! But nope, our faith was not enough. D:"
11-09-2020T03:26:42,MatyMaty,awww
11-09-2020T03:26:53,MatyMaty,its been a while XP
11-09-2020T03:27:17,BadFoMo,New project = card game?
11-09-2020T03:27:20,SageSaga,but one of the guys who was supporting me just sent me 4000 USD to get it printed anyways
11-09-2020T03:28:02,SageSaga,so this guy gifted me 4k dollars so i could afford to get it printed
11-09-2020T03:28:16,MatyMaty,Oh right I remember that!
11-09-2020T03:28:30,SageSaga,well that guy hasnt stopped giving me money since
11-09-2020T03:28:51,SageSaga,turns out hes an awesome author
11-09-2020T03:29:10,MatyMaty,and he wants you to illustrate a work of his? :O
11-09-2020T03:29:22,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-ohmy:
11-09-2020T03:30:04,SageSaga,he does
11-09-2020T03:30:40,BadFoMo,What is his work?
11-09-2020T03:30:48,SageSaga,hes been commissioning me for month after month-
11-09-2020T03:30:50,MatyMaty,wow that's great!
11-09-2020T03:30:51,SageSaga,https://smile.amazon.com/Aethers-Guard-Revival-Book-ebook/dp/B08H4LNR43/ref=sr_1_3
11-09-2020T03:30:58,SageSaga,there's his latest book
11-09-2020T03:31:02,MatyMaty,Congrats Sage! :D
11-09-2020T03:31:16,SageSaga,I read the first and second book of this series- he does a TON of other books too
11-09-2020T03:31:20,SageSaga,but i LOVED this book
11-09-2020T03:31:33,SageSaga,and he wants me to try and turn it into a comic O_O
11-09-2020T03:32:27,SageSaga,so nothings in stone yet but im gonna do a trial comic that he'll of course be paying me for- should be about 6-10 pages
11-09-2020T03:32:28,MatyMaty,oooh!
11-09-2020T03:32:37,BadFoMo,"If it's not a scam somehow, cool!"
11-09-2020T03:32:45,MatyMaty,why would it be a scam?
11-09-2020T03:32:48,FenceEqualizer,Fracking congrats on that sage.
11-09-2020T03:32:50,SageSaga,if that goes well he wants the whole thing
11-09-2020T03:32:57,ZRO4825,"Well, considering we ended up with our AI books cuz of this guy, I sincerely doubt it's a scam of any sort, lol"
11-09-2020T03:33:02,SageSaga,and hes pay as you go so - cant really scam it XD
11-09-2020T03:33:23,MatyMaty,looks at her A.I book on her shelf
11-09-2020T03:33:29,BadFoMo,"Alright, cool then!"
11-09-2020T03:33:40,petricolor,I need to work on my book more thanks for the reminder
11-09-2020T03:33:43,MatyMaty,with the secret newd Relm doodle
11-09-2020T03:33:56,ZRO4825,>:V
11-09-2020T03:33:57,SageSaga,my major issues are converting 2 books that are almost 650 pages each into comic scripts
11-09-2020T03:34:07,SageSaga,she's lying
11-09-2020T03:34:09,FenceEqualizer,I can see why you'd want a ghost. A big project like that? You'd probably want to give it your full attention.
11-09-2020T03:34:09,petricolor,I'd do it chapter by chapter
11-09-2020T03:34:11,MatyMaty,XD
11-09-2020T03:34:19,SageSaga,cannot do Petri
11-09-2020T03:34:21,ZRO4825,How do you know? She might've doodled it HERSELF! O_O;
11-09-2020T03:34:26,MatyMaty,"yeah that sounds complicated, Sage"
11-09-2020T03:34:34,SageSaga,some of the chapters are short and not long enough for a chapter of a comic
11-09-2020T03:34:43,petricolor,well i meant for planning
11-09-2020T03:34:47,petricolor,but i get that
11-09-2020T03:35:05,ZRO4825,I should get back to writing fanfics again...
11-09-2020T03:35:07,SageSaga,the other issue is theres a few explicit sex scenes XD
11-09-2020T03:35:22,MatyMaty,OwO
11-09-2020T03:35:26,ZRO4825,Or maybe actually putting my stupid tablet to use and working on that drawing thing I started in on. <_<;;;
11-09-2020T03:35:30,ZRO4825,and...oh my OwO
11-09-2020T03:35:46,SageSaga,so i might hire someone else to do those pages...
11-09-2020T03:36:00,SageSaga,or fade to black!
11-09-2020T03:36:47,ZRO4825,Seems reasonable
11-09-2020T03:36:57,SageSaga,book is so good though- i want book 3 T_T
11-09-2020T03:37:14,MatyMaty,no fading to black!
11-09-2020T03:37:37,MatyMaty,Or else I'll keep reading A.I right to left
11-09-2020T03:37:44,SageSaga,XD
11-09-2020T03:37:53,ZRO4825,lol
11-09-2020T03:41:00,MatyMaty,well you liked my version of Relm
11-09-2020T03:41:02,MatyMaty,https://i.imgur.com/VKj20Wa.png
11-09-2020T03:41:35,ZRO4825,Yus! ^_^
11-09-2020T03:42:18,MatyMaty,I gotta make a post with all the A.I drawings I've done
11-09-2020T03:42:28,MatyMaty,I don't think I ever posted them XD
11-09-2020T03:42:52,ZRO4825,:o
11-09-2020T03:42:57,SageSaga,twitter- tag me - i need more readers XD
11-09-2020T03:43:29,ZRO4825,"Been doing my part, but I'm no big name on there, so not sure my retweets help at all. :joy:"
11-09-2020T03:43:45,MatyMaty,will do!
11-09-2020T03:43:57,MatyMaty,"alas, I better head to bed"
11-09-2020T03:44:04,MatyMaty,is almost 4 am here XP
11-09-2020T03:44:05,SageSaga,maty has more than double my followers XD
11-09-2020T03:44:14,MatyMaty,aww XD
11-09-2020T03:45:00,MatyMaty,Nite nite everyone!
11-09-2020T03:45:06,ZRO4825,G'night Maty!
11-09-2020T03:45:06,SageSaga,gnight!
11-09-2020T03:45:12,MatyMaty,Don't bully Sage too much!
11-09-2020T03:45:21,ZRO4825,I can't! If I do he stops supplying the goods. o_o
11-09-2020T03:45:24,FenceEqualizer,Night Maty!
11-09-2020T03:46:47,ZRO4825,Ugh. Not looking forward to 9 hour shift tomorrow. At least it's driving and not being stuck inside.
11-09-2020T03:48:40,SageSaga,good luck man
11-09-2020T03:49:07,ZRO4825,"Eh, honestly, it should be fine unless I like, break a leg or something somehow, lol"
11-09-2020T03:50:34,SageSaga,i think a broken leg is preferable to the pain im in
11-09-2020T03:50:56,ZRO4825,That is possible. I wouldn't know. I've managed to live thus far with no broken bones.
11-09-2020T03:51:28,SageSaga,i broke 3 bones in my toes and 3 in my ankle at the same time- those were my only breaks
11-09-2020T03:51:45,ZRO4825,"I know I usually tell people to never half-ass anything, but jeez man, lol"
11-09-2020T03:52:29,ZRO4825,"I have one friend, I swear up and down we need to put him in a bubble. He gets freshly injured like, at least once a month it seems."
11-09-2020T03:52:34,SageSaga,obs lost connection-
11-09-2020T03:52:47,ZRO4825,"I wondered there, lol"
11-09-2020T03:53:29,SageSaga,is back?
11-09-2020T03:53:33,ZRO4825,Yus
11-09-2020T03:57:51,aeoronwah,yep
11-09-2020T03:57:58,aeoronwah,also hello
11-09-2020T03:58:06,ZRO4825,Heyyo Aeoronwah ^_^
11-09-2020T03:58:51,SageSaga,yo Aeoronwah!
11-09-2020T03:59:27,SageSaga,wow that disconnect killed all the viewers- its legit just us 3
11-09-2020T03:59:38,aeoronwah,wow
11-09-2020T03:59:47,ZRO4825,D:
11-09-2020T03:59:58,SageSaga,and now one of you is gone!
11-09-2020T04:00:24,ZRO4825,We are the disappearing.
11-09-2020T04:00:34,ZRO4825,In my defense I SHOULD be going to bed. :rofl:
11-09-2020T04:01:02,SageSaga,go ahead man- im just gonna try and finish this and head to bed myself- but i doubt i can sleep with this pain
11-09-2020T04:01:17,ZRO4825,:c  I hope you're able to get that fixed some time soon.
11-09-2020T04:01:45,SageSaga,2 weeks to even see the surgeon to discuss it
11-09-2020T04:01:49,ZRO4825,"But yeah, I better get to bed. Driving with no sleep is NOT high on my list of fun things to do."
11-09-2020T04:02:12,SageSaga,"hopefully he goes ""I can do it in 2 days- here's your prep guide"""
11-09-2020T04:02:20,SageSaga,take care man sleep well
11-09-2020T04:02:32,ZRO4825,Here's to hopin for ya. See ya on the flip side. '.'/
11-09-2020T04:27:54,Hogan,Good morninges!
11-09-2020T04:28:05,SageSaga,yo Hogan
11-09-2020T04:28:29,Hogan,Yo Sage!
11-09-2020T04:28:50,Hogan,Nice to see you here at a decent hour :-)
11-09-2020T04:28:53,SageSaga,XD
11-09-2020T04:28:57,SageSaga,decent- yes
11-09-2020T04:29:16,SageSaga,im taking too long because im currently in pain ^^
11-09-2020T04:29:35,sodaYEET,2 streams in a day?
11-09-2020T04:29:48,SageSaga,uhhh-
11-09-2020T04:29:55,SageSaga,OBS disconnected
11-09-2020T04:30:08,sodaYEET,oh
11-09-2020T04:30:09,SageSaga,so it restarted you may have gotten another notification
11-09-2020T04:30:36,Hogan,"Yeah, I noticed it in earlier comments... where's the source of the pain? :-|"
11-09-2020T04:31:45,SageSaga,something i need surgery for- im not talking about the details
11-09-2020T04:32:55,Hogan,"Fair enough, I wish you well in that regard"
11-09-2020T04:33:14,SageSaga,i can say the pain is extreme- and very long lasting- up to 14 hours is the longest ive had it go on for-
11-09-2020T04:33:16,SageSaga,and nothing helps
11-09-2020T04:33:56,sodaYEET,have you tried painkiller?
11-09-2020T04:33:58,Hogan,"Fragged, I can think of few ailments that warrants such unpreventable pain :-|"
11-09-2020T04:34:25,SageSaga,. . . Soda- i said nothing helps i mean it
11-09-2020T04:34:56,SageSaga,i mean- maybe Morphine but i cant exactly just get that XD
11-09-2020T04:35:14,Hogan,And that has more than a few sideeffects too...
11-09-2020T04:35:20,SageSaga,im seeing a surgeon in a couple weeks
11-09-2020T04:35:28,sodaYEET,"well, that suck"
11-09-2020T04:36:52,Hogan,Good luck with that
11-09-2020T04:37:05,SageSaga,ty
11-09-2020T04:37:54,SageSaga,if my insurance doesnt cover it im just gonna have to do it anyways and pay it off over time
11-09-2020T04:39:19,sodaYEET,move to Canada and get free healthcare!
11-09-2020T04:40:03,SageSaga,now that is a good idea
11-09-2020T04:40:50,Hogan,"Hey, Scandinavia does the same! :D"
11-09-2020T04:41:02,Hogan,Let the bidding war for Sage begin! :p
11-09-2020T04:41:35,sodaYEET,BTW what time zone are you in?
11-09-2020T04:41:42,SageSaga,East Coast USA
11-09-2020T04:41:47,SageSaga,its 5:41am
11-09-2020T04:42:18,sodaYEET,Eastern standard time
11-09-2020T04:42:30,Hogan,"So my ""Good Morning"" almost covers your timezone too :-)"
11-09-2020T04:43:03,SageSaga,ive been streaming since 9pm
11-09-2020T04:43:34,Hogan,"Yeah, I noticed my usual 3 AM notice of you online :-)"
11-09-2020T04:43:52,Hogan,... if the stream hasn't reset I never would have noticed you were still around...
11-09-2020T04:44:10,Hogan,"But damn, 8 hours of streaming under pain... you are a monster"
11-09-2020T04:44:30,sodaYEET,I see picarto notification at like 8AM and this one just about 6PM here
11-09-2020T04:45:17,sodaYEET,wait it's 4PM not 6 lol
11-09-2020T04:46:06,Hogan,Timezones are crazy :D
11-09-2020T04:46:54,sodaYEET,yeah it's hard trying to catch Sage and Tom stream cuz I'm not American
11-09-2020T04:47:26,Hogan,"I learned recently that, at least here in the country, they differed the time on the day based on when the sun was in zenit above the town square... which means two cities 300 km apart could have 10 min timedifference on their watches XD"
11-09-2020T04:47:55,Hogan,... that was 150 years ago and they went to standard national time with the arrival of trains and trainschedules :-)
11-09-2020T04:48:07,sodaYEET,that's good
11-09-2020T04:48:28,sodaYEET,the entire country of China use 1 time zone
11-09-2020T04:48:52,sodaYEET,so the westernmost part the sun rises at 10AM or something
11-09-2020T04:49:10,sodaYEET,weird choice
11-09-2020T04:49:12,Hogan,"Yeah, same here Soda, being CET-based I get 3 AM notification of Sage being online, so its hard to catch a stream on that schedule :-)"
11-09-2020T04:50:10,SageSaga,its why i have 2 very different stream times for my 2 streams XD
11-09-2020T04:50:11,Hogan,"Yeah, most countries tend to try to keep the whole of it in the same timezone... but with the size of china that creates some strange sideeffects..."
11-09-2020T04:50:32,SageSaga,one at 9pm-4am (or later) and one at 3pm to 6-7pm
11-09-2020T04:50:53,sodaYEET,that's very nice of you
11-09-2020T04:51:26,sodaYEET,Indochina Time is 11 hours apart from EST
11-09-2020T04:51:32,Hogan,"Yep, gives us bloody timezone-freaks a time to catch up :-)"
11-09-2020T04:54:10,sodaYEET,"I have this little April fool idea in my that goes like ""hello my name is Tomiplier"" and Mark trying to draw on Tom's stream"
11-09-2020T04:54:34,Hogan,"Which reminds me... Sage, you need to update your bookstore... Denmark is not on the list of shipping destinations! :-)"
11-09-2020T04:54:43,SageSaga,waaaat
11-09-2020T04:54:51,SageSaga,it was-
11-09-2020T04:55:14,Hogan,"I dunno, but I get a very limited number of possible destinations when I check..."
11-09-2020T04:55:39,Hogan,"I mean, Sweden and Norway is there, but I feel left out of the Scandinavian package..."
11-09-2020T04:55:42,SageSaga,well- wanna just wait for book 2 to come out and i can send both?
11-09-2020T04:55:50,SageSaga,it will save us both some cash XD
11-09-2020T04:56:10,Hogan,... all considering we are the center of importance in Scandinavia (but dont tell the others!)
11-09-2020T04:56:30,Hogan,"Now that would be a sweet deal, shipping costs are murder!"
11-09-2020T04:57:03,Hogan,Guess I can wait a bit longer... good things are worth waiting for!
11-09-2020T04:57:21,sodaYEET,international shipping sure is great but the bloody shipping cost
11-09-2020T04:57:45,sodaYEET,that one thing that prevent me from buying so many things
11-09-2020T04:57:55,SageSaga,book 2 is gonna be shorter and cost a bit less- and is going to include the part im working on right now- so ive only got a few more pages before i can start putting it together to print!
11-09-2020T04:58:02,Hogan,"Yeah, that's also what keeping my collection of webcomics offline down... need to concentrate on the best stuff..."
11-09-2020T04:58:10,SageSaga,so early next year i think i'll be printing it
11-09-2020T04:58:16,SageSaga,maybe even by december
11-09-2020T04:58:42,Hogan,Excellent! That would be a good start on 2021 :-)
11-09-2020T04:59:12,sodaYEET,well if the entire America's not on fire by then
11-09-2020T04:59:41,Hogan,"Yeah, crossing my fingeres for that.."
11-09-2020T05:00:15,sodaYEET,I'm not sure if it's just the news outlet that's presenting the craziest of news
11-09-2020T05:00:17,SageSaga,its practically impossible for all of america to be on fire
11-09-2020T05:00:19,sodaYEET,or it's that bad
11-09-2020T05:00:32,SageSaga,the rocky mountains will stop most of it...
11-09-2020T05:00:39,Hogan,I was just about to order the newest book by a friend and webcomic artist... but he lives in Oregon and his house burned down yesterday :-|
11-09-2020T05:00:52,SageSaga,ouch! T_T thats horrible
11-09-2020T05:01:18,Hogan,Not a bad word about Americans... but someone will find a way to get the fire across if need be... :-|
11-09-2020T05:01:35,SageSaga,"""We are in a pandemic - leave- go home"" ""My home burned down"" "". . . . CRAAAAAP"""
11-09-2020T05:01:58,Hogan,"Yeah, just caught the news yesterday, he and his wife as well as their cats made it away safely, but they lost everything they wasn't carrying..."
11-09-2020T05:02:44,SageSaga,well we also have the Mississippi river - and then the appalachian mountains
11-09-2020T05:02:46,Hogan,... including his stash of new books
11-09-2020T05:02:58,sodaYEET,I wonder why I see the west coast wildfire every years
11-09-2020T05:03:19,SageSaga,unlike Australia we dont have a giant carpet of burnable material running through the entire country
11-09-2020T05:03:31,Hogan,Sounds like the East Coast has erected multiple defenses for this occasion XD
11-09-2020T05:03:36,FenceEqualizer,"Tried to stay up but X_x Have a goodnight Sage, thanks for streaming. Also have a goodnight all"
11-09-2020T05:03:49,Hogan,Night Fence!
11-09-2020T05:03:52,SageSaga,take care Fence! ty so much
11-09-2020T05:04:14,sodaYEET,night!
11-09-2020T05:04:23,SageSaga,the east coasts main issue is- CA brings in more money than most of the states combined
11-09-2020T05:04:42,Hogan,We've divided up our country in several different islands... that and the fact that we took out most of our forests hundreds of  years ago XD
11-09-2020T05:05:09,sodaYEET,California can practically be it's own country
11-09-2020T05:05:19,SageSaga,it really can
11-09-2020T05:05:28,Hogan,"IIRC, California has the 5th largest economy in the world?"
11-09-2020T05:05:36,SageSaga,you have to combine the 3 other largest GDP states to beat CA
11-09-2020T05:05:44,AttackCats,"Hogan: Not any more, think it dropped to 6th"
11-09-2020T05:05:59,AttackCats,"Also, CA has horrific forest management"
11-09-2020T05:06:08,Hogan,Ah! Thanks for updating AC XD
11-09-2020T05:06:16,SageSaga,they actually dont have that bad forest mangement
11-09-2020T05:06:22,AttackCats,They did when I lived there
11-09-2020T05:06:44,sodaYEET,just somebody decided to have gender reveal party I guess
11-09-2020T05:06:51,Hogan,At far as I've heard most of the woods in CA actually fall under the federal governments upkeep...
11-09-2020T05:06:52,AttackCats,Saw it for myself and I have not heard that it's gotten any better
11-09-2020T05:07:13,SageSaga,you cant blame forest management on people willfully starting fires
11-09-2020T05:07:22,Hogan,"Oh yes, the gender reveal party didn't really help.... accounts for at least one of the cases :-|"
11-09-2020T05:07:32,AttackCats,"Hogan: Much like the interstate highways, the state is deputized to care for them and its given money for that work"
11-09-2020T05:07:42,SageSaga,"thats like saying ""We have the fire department so its ok for everyone to set their homes on fire at the same time"""
11-09-2020T05:07:55,AttackCats,"Yeah, not saying that idiots setting fires = forestry management"
11-09-2020T05:08:06,sodaYEET,that's a very American thing
11-09-2020T05:08:24,AttackCats,"The bad forestry management isn't the cause of a lot of these fires, but it makes them so much worse"
11-09-2020T05:08:32,Hogan,AttackCats: Thats on a level of governmental management I cant keep up with :-)
11-09-2020T05:08:53,SageSaga,that's true- i can agree with that AttackCats
11-09-2020T05:09:48,SageSaga,arent most of the wildfires man made though?
11-09-2020T05:10:07,sodaYEET,yeah
11-09-2020T05:10:16,AttackCats,Depends on year and season
11-09-2020T05:10:29,SageSaga,XD
11-09-2020T05:10:48,sodaYEET,well in my country anyway
11-09-2020T05:10:57,SageSaga,i just looked it up and its like 1% of forest fires are natural- while over 50% arent arsen- but just general public screwing up
11-09-2020T05:10:59,AttackCats,"But yes, I'd guess 50-75% of annual West Coast fires are man made or the result of man"
11-09-2020T05:11:28,AttackCats,"Sage, I'd say it's way more than 1 percent in most years"
11-09-2020T05:11:51,sodaYEET,it's mostly farmers who are too lazy to take care of their rice field
11-09-2020T05:12:10,sodaYEET,and just burn it so they can plant new rice
11-09-2020T05:12:22,SageSaga,i dunno - 1% sounds right for naturally forming fires
11-09-2020T05:12:27,SageSaga,usually lightning strikes
11-09-2020T05:12:29,AttackCats,"I'd go with this year being 75% man/idiots, 20% unknown, 5% natural"
11-09-2020T05:12:48,sodaYEET,2020 special
11-09-2020T05:12:58,SageSaga,ok well- im looking at actual stats not a guess XD
11-09-2020T05:13:28,AttackCats,2020's been fun. :P
11-09-2020T05:15:41,SageSaga,all done!
11-09-2020T05:15:54,sodaYEET,nice!

11-09-2020T05:16:40,SageSaga,im gonna try to sleep- though i doubt this pain will let me
11-09-2020T05:17:06,AttackCats,"Thanks for stream, Sage"
11-09-2020T05:17:07,SageSaga,i'll be back in uhh 8 hours and 43 minutes

11-09-2020T13:02:40,CrRAR,Yeah lots of places are very confusing rn

11-09-2020T14:44:30,CrRAR,I think some services offer like a cellular/broadband modem for outage prone areas

11-09-2020T14:44:44,CrRAR,Not really ideal though for streaming I'd imaginr tho
11-09-2020T14:44:51,CrimsonQuill,How are you all
11-09-2020T14:44:57,SageSaga,That's nice that some services do that
11-09-2020T14:45:03,CrRAR,"May cost more too to have that kind of thing too, dunno"
11-09-2020T14:47:29,CrRAR,"I know ISPs are going in this weird direction where instaed of improving and fixing what's wrong with their networks they're sooner just switching ""landline"" services to wireless cellular connections, 5G may help with that type of thing."

11-09-2020T14:50:04,CrRAR,services
11-09-2020T14:51:49,CrimsonQuill,Wired landline connections have proven time and again to be more consistent and reliable than wireless.

11-09-2020T17:07:36,CrRAR,maybe they should season them with cinnamon or something
11-09-2020T17:07:50,SpazztasticKiwi,main consistence is they’re dry and linger
11-09-2020T17:08:06,SpazztasticKiwi,they don’t need more stupid ideas
11-09-2020T17:08:18,CrRAR,sounds like an acquired taste
11-09-2020T17:08:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark almost entertained the idea of an eyebrow piercing after he had his ear pierced
11-09-2020T17:08:47,SpazztasticKiwi,yesterday - don’t make it worse
11-09-2020T17:11:04,CrRAR,some dog treats do advertise having parsley in them
11-09-2020T17:11:29,CrRAR,so I wonder if they just try to make them taste grassy
11-09-2020T17:11:38,CrRAR,dogs love grass
11-09-2020T17:11:57,CrRAR,even though they shouldn't
11-09-2020T17:12:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera likes chewing on grass
11-09-2020T17:13:07,SpazztasticKiwi,then again he’ll also try eating anything that doesn’t try taking a bite out of him first
11-09-2020T17:15:33,SpazztasticKiwi,ok so the chicken jerky is a sweeping favorite
11-09-2020T17:16:01,SpazztasticKiwi,the rest can go in the garbage - but I suspect they’ll go to Henry spencer & chica
11-09-2020T17:17:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Chicas sitting at their feet the whole time like “plz”
11-09-2020T17:19:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Marks trying to get her to eat from the chair like a people but she’s not allowed to eat off the table so she’s not touching any of it
11-09-2020T17:19:39,SpazztasticKiwi,she droolin tho
11-09-2020T17:21:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"AS SOON as they’re put on the floor, she sucked em up"
11-09-2020T17:22:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Spencer was pickier & Henry was slowest to try them
11-09-2020T17:23:00,Corinthian,Hey

11-09-2020T17:34:25,TheSexyBeast,Clovis is the smartest kid in the room before the adults arrive
11-09-2020T17:34:38,Mandag,The adults being Nora
11-09-2020T17:34:57,Corinthian,Clovis would have probably reminded the teacher to assign homework to the class
11-09-2020T17:35:08,johnnytho,oh he's THAT kid
11-09-2020T17:35:18,TheSexyBeast,Rose is an adult

11-09-2020T17:37:16,steelabjur,Howdy Rima!
11-09-2020T17:38:07,johnnytho,Clovis is the kid that would get mad at his parents because they bought him a sports car in the wrong color
11-09-2020T17:38:30,CrRAR,haha
11-09-2020T17:38:43,Twokinds,true
11-09-2020T17:38:46,TheSexyBeast,Then he'd sell them into slavery
11-09-2020T17:38:56,Twokinds,The car they bought him doesn't match his other ones.
11-09-2020T17:38:56,InTheLionsDen,Clovis bought the sports car by selling off his parents.
11-09-2020T17:39:01,johnnytho,haha

11-09-2020T17:41:32,CrRAR,pecking is an effective defense...
11-09-2020T17:41:37,CrRAR,but axes better
11-09-2020T17:42:16,TheSexyBeast,Rose must have realized the mansion is under attack by now.
11-09-2020T17:42:51,CrRAR,I'd think at least it getting destroyed would trip her clean-y senses
11-09-2020T17:43:49,steelabjur,"@TheSexyBeast question is, does she care when Operation Remake Saria is in progress?"
11-09-2020T17:44:10,CrRAR,of course yeah there are other things occuring now
11-09-2020T17:44:19,InTheLionsDen,Attacks on the mansion happen every other week. Today she is busy dealing with Trace and his plots.
11-09-2020T17:44:44,Pwatcher67,hi all

11-09-2020T17:47:18,CrRAR,we only really been seeing inside the oasis room right?
11-09-2020T17:47:25,NezumiYuki,Dang it... If only Rose hadn't detected Maren and gone all rogue A.I. and background process the mansion defenses... Clovis wouldn't have been able to just waltz right in like this.....
11-09-2020T17:47:27,CrRAR,yeah beast
11-09-2020T17:47:28,PhillTheGamerDE,Hello @all

11-09-2020T17:50:12,steelabjur,@NezumiYuki I'm sure under normal circumstances that zap clovis shook off would have been enough to handle most invaders. It's just Clovis came with all the magic loot he could to do the job.
11-09-2020T17:50:25,CrRAR,or tom sawyer style hat!

11-09-2020T19:15:05,Mediawatcher,"Well yeah the blast hit the railing and not Sythe directly, I think Clovis splitting up with time was a terrible idea"
11-09-2020T19:15:12,Mediawatcher,Them was a terrible idea
11-09-2020T19:15:38,CrRAR,"Eh, Clovis is just sure of his capabilities I guess"
11-09-2020T19:16:13,Mediawatcher,That’s gonna bit him in the butt

11-09-2020T19:17:12,Ordithus,we can hope as much
11-09-2020T19:17:44,Ordithus,Lynn is still somewhere.  I'm sure he has plenty of bureaucratic methods of stopping Clovis and co.
11-09-2020T19:18:14,CrRAR,He'll be the self-proclaimed dungeon bondsman
11-09-2020T19:18:19,Ordithus,ha
11-09-2020T19:19:30,CrRAR,"Boy needed something to feel authoritative over, so he took over dungeon duties"
11-09-2020T19:19:40,Mediawatcher,I wonder if lynn will show up at all this chapter
11-09-2020T19:20:02,Mediawatcher,He’s pretty much the only one who isn’t trapped in the beach and Sythe is currently down for the count
11-09-2020T19:21:08,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Where is Eric?
11-09-2020T19:21:34,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,When is the last time we’ve seen him?
11-09-2020T19:21:49,Ordithus,beach
11-09-2020T19:22:01,CrRAR,When he got bopped by flora for wanting to draw Reni I think
11-09-2020T19:22:24,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Yeah.
11-09-2020T19:23:02,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Where is he now? If he’s still in the beach room he is not being much help
11-09-2020T19:23:35,CrRAR,Probably doing his best impression of a sand mermaid.

11-09-2020T19:34:51,CrRAR,I personally have a theory they evolved in the caves dragons live in by being exposed to excess mana stones

11-09-2020T19:38:34,CrRAR,...and a scarier face
11-09-2020T19:38:37,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,All her arm growth went to legs probably

11-09-2020T19:40:16,CrRAR,is it lemony?
11-09-2020T19:40:33,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,I’ve... never tasted hand sanitizer
11-09-2020T19:40:38,CrRAR,noooo
11-09-2020T19:40:42,CrRAR,the scent lol
11-09-2020T19:41:08,CrRAR,I've seen green
11-09-2020T19:41:11,CrRAR,ish
11-09-2020T19:41:25,CrRAR,but that's aloe enhanced
11-09-2020T19:41:41,CrRAR,(though probably a dye cuz aloe is actually quite clear)
11-09-2020T19:41:46,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,It’s like slightly citrus-y but so is the clear one
11-09-2020T19:42:02,CrRAR,hrrrrrmmmm
11-09-2020T19:42:06,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,So idk
11-09-2020T19:42:17,CrRAR,maybe just skip the weird yellowy one
11-09-2020T19:42:30,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,It seems to work
11-09-2020T19:42:51,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,But yeah

11-09-2020T19:48:44,CrRAR,is it more liquidy that usual?
11-09-2020T19:49:07,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,A little
11-09-2020T19:49:08,CrRAR,maybe it got hot or something
11-09-2020T19:49:15,CrRAR,was it in a car?
11-09-2020T19:49:49,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,"With the government mail situation, who knows how long it was in a hot ware house"
11-09-2020T19:49:59,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,So that’s probably it
11-09-2020T19:50:30,CrRAR,yeah I could see temperature causing it o be weird
11-09-2020T19:51:25,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Plus it’s from my moms insurance so it could have been sitting in a diff ware house before this
11-09-2020T19:51:41,CrRAR,"yeah, plus maybe they're stressed to produce so much lately that the batches are inconsistent or something"
11-09-2020T19:52:04,CrRAR,There are so many producers that just popped up pretty much overnight
11-09-2020T19:53:25,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Ikr

11-09-2020T22:51:10,SpazztasticKiwi,does scorekeeper ring a bell for anyone here
11-09-2020T22:53:07,AspiringNoodle,Not a one
11-09-2020T22:53:13,CrRAR,quiddich?
11-09-2020T23:00:45,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s a film sequel idea for star wars
11-09-2020T23:00:53,SpazztasticKiwi,kickstarter
11-09-2020T23:04:10,CrRAR,is it happening?
11-09-2020T23:05:36,CrRAR,honestly with all the different creative direction in the star wars franchise these days a kickstarted one is not a surprise
11-09-2020T23:05:57,CrRAR,"Disney: ""You're HIRED!"""
11-09-2020T23:06:40,AspiringNoodle,"Supposedly Disney is purging ""woke"" people"
11-09-2020T23:06:54,AspiringNoodle,I guess killing a license to print money would piss off the head Mouse
11-09-2020T23:07:22,CrRAR,"""Also, make sure to throw in some blatant themes about inclusion and sickening doses of FAMILY FUN:tm: or you're fired."""
11-09-2020T23:07:43,CrRAR,yeah pretty much noodle
11-09-2020T23:08:59,CrRAR,Star Wars directors have basically become the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor role in Harry Potter
11-09-2020T23:09:44,SpazztasticKiwi,nah from what I can tell of it it’s a small film crew with the idea in Atlanta
11-09-2020T23:11:04,SpazztasticKiwi,follows a bossk character
11-09-2020T23:11:32,SpazztasticKiwi,they’re looking for film funding to do the project in covid times
11-09-2020T23:12:44,AspiringNoodle,Sounds cool :D
11-09-2020T23:13:01,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, if Disney just put people in charge who actually *liked* what the films were originally, they'd be set"
11-09-2020T23:15:34,CrRAR,Yeah how much Hamill spoke out about where Luke's character went was really telling
11-09-2020T23:15:53,CrRAR,I'm honestly surprised they allowed him to be so outspoken
11-09-2020T23:16:20,SpazztasticKiwi,what are they gonna do
11-09-2020T23:16:36,SpazztasticKiwi,recut the movie and remove him
11-09-2020T23:16:39,SpazztasticKiwi,?
11-09-2020T23:16:52,CrRAR,usually there are contract stipulations that prevent disparaging a film you're in
11-09-2020T23:17:09,CrRAR,basically it makes the actors a walikng endorsement for a while
11-09-2020T23:17:18,CrRAR,...contractually...
11-09-2020T23:18:00,SpazztasticKiwi,like Marks a walking ad for alienware rn
11-09-2020T23:18:17,CrRAR,Of course I'm happy he was outspoken at least
11-09-2020T23:18:53,CrRAR,"well, that's okay"
11-09-2020T23:20:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder what Marks gonna do with his old computer desk chair and efectively his whole old set up they replaced for him
11-09-2020T23:21:02,CrRAR,I think Hamill's biggest issue was just that a Jedi isn't supposed to lose hope and not persevere
11-09-2020T23:21:16,CrRAR,uhhh
11-09-2020T23:21:29,CrRAR,Maybe he can use it elsewhere!
11-09-2020T23:21:40,CrRAR,Was it a nice setup he already had?
11-09-2020T23:22:07,SpazztasticKiwi,i guess so
11-09-2020T23:22:20,SpazztasticKiwi,he used it for all his recordings and streams
11-09-2020T23:22:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"if he does the usual Mark way, he’ll just store it somewhere"
11-09-2020T23:23:15,SpazztasticKiwi,he gets it moved in tho and the first thing he does?
11-09-2020T23:23:19,SpazztasticKiwi,play with the chair
11-09-2020T23:23:43,CrRAR,gotta learn all the buttons and knobies
11-09-2020T23:24:20,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s on his ig right now
11-09-2020T23:25:02,CrRAR,Is it so advanced it has its own app?
11-09-2020T23:25:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"he’s always not liked the lighy set ups yet alienware has fully lit desks, pcs, monitors, keyboards, the whole 9 yards"
11-09-2020T23:25:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I guess he’s taking it because he really likes the customer service he says they have
11-09-2020T23:25:59,SpazztasticKiwi,....and because it was all free
11-09-2020T23:26:06,SpazztasticKiwi,.........and they paid him

11-09-2020T23:31:28,CrRAR,"he does do those videos sometime with the red LED lighting in the bg, so maybe this desk will help with those"
11-09-2020T23:31:45,SpazztasticKiwi,that was mostly bg lights tho
11-09-2020T23:31:56,SpazztasticKiwi,this is gonna be all around and in front of him lights
11-09-2020T23:32:05,SpazztasticKiwi,which he’s said is too busy and unnecessary
11-09-2020T23:32:10,CrRAR,well now he can look extra villiany
11-09-2020T23:32:38,Ordithus,I've never been into flashy lights either
11-09-2020T23:32:51,CrRAR,me either really

11-09-2020T23:33:49,AspiringNoodle,My RAM has this really cool waterfall effect
11-09-2020T23:33:58,CrRAR,I did always do fans and stuff with LEDs
11-09-2020T23:34:09,AspiringNoodle,Would love to limit the colors on it
11-09-2020T23:34:16,CrRAR,my oooold corsair RAM had capacity use indicators w/ LEDs
11-09-2020T23:34:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"besides, it cuts down your audience potential with all that noise going on around"
11-09-2020T23:35:04,CrRAR,the case for my main computer doesn't have a window
11-09-2020T23:35:27,CrRAR,I have a smaller form factor one w/ a window but no lights in that whatsoever
11-09-2020T23:35:45,SpazztasticKiwi,a small loss Mark didn’t keep the earring
11-09-2020T23:35:51,SpazztasticKiwi,it looked good
11-09-2020T23:36:58,AspiringNoodle,"My case has 2 200mm fans with leds, an led logo on the gpu, LED ram, and some LEDs on the watercooling block"

11-09-2020T23:38:11,AspiringNoodle,"without the control software, the LED's on the GPU / block cycle through all the colors"

11-09-2020T23:38:21,AspiringNoodle,"RAM I already mentioned, and the fan has a rainbow wheel"

11-09-2020T23:38:53,AspiringNoodle,I'd want to synchronize in some fashion the GPU / block if I didn't set them static
11-09-2020T23:38:54,SpazztasticKiwi,🐿🌈🐿
11-09-2020T23:39:11,AspiringNoodle,And the fans I would either want static or limited color wheel

11-09-2020T23:39:31,AspiringNoodle,It's just so calming
11-09-2020T23:40:14,SpazztasticKiwi,🦉”she’s so calm as well”
11-09-2020T23:40:47,CrRAR,"lol I was just thinking  it would probably be inefficient but a case with a waterfall feature in it would be legit, like contained in plastic at the front or something"
11-09-2020T23:41:02,CrRAR,Like so it looks like water is flowing THROUGH the case
11-09-2020T23:41:48,Ordithus,if you have watercooling might as well make it a waterfall
11-09-2020T23:41:59,Ordithus,little fountain
11-09-2020T23:42:36,AspiringNoodle,Watercooling is a neat way to make a clean pc build
11-09-2020T23:43:09,AspiringNoodle,"There are some air coolers that give better cooling performance for noticeably cheaper, but watercooling is MUCH sleeker"
11-09-2020T23:43:20,CrRAR,"maybe there could be like little dolphins that bob around or something, or maybe mario themed with cheepcheeps"
11-09-2020T23:43:46,CrRAR,depending on temperature of the water they can become more or less boyant somehow
11-09-2020T23:44:07,CrRAR,"like those ""balloon"" thermometer things xD"
