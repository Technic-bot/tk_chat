06-11-2020T01:00:51,K3IDRAN,I'm Canadian bro
06-11-2020T01:01:14,SageSaga,whats your point?
06-11-2020T01:01:39,Zakuru,i didn't get my license until i was like 21
06-11-2020T01:01:52,johnnytho,I didnt start until 18
06-11-2020T01:02:01,Dadrobit,"That reminds me, I still need to update my license..."
06-11-2020T01:02:05,BlackjackSec99,"my friend didnt get hers till just a few months ago, shes 28"
06-11-2020T01:02:14,Ordithus,don't you have until you're 80 to do that dadro?
06-11-2020T01:02:28,AspiringNoodle,AZ licenses need a new photo every 12 years
06-11-2020T01:02:37,K3IDRAN,Probably gonna get it at 26 or 17
06-11-2020T01:02:39,AspiringNoodle,"It's kind've a soft expiration, I guess?"
06-11-2020T01:02:41,KeefMcDerpface,"For a second, I thought that was a sunburn on Red..."
06-11-2020T01:02:46,Dadrobit,Technically it's good until 2057.
06-11-2020T01:02:47,johnnytho,26? why
06-11-2020T01:02:51,K3IDRAN,16*
06-11-2020T01:02:56,johnnytho,oh
06-11-2020T01:03:01,Zakuru,???
06-11-2020T01:03:08,Zakuru,you a youngling
06-11-2020T01:03:19,unsteddyphoenix,Too young!
06-11-2020T01:03:45,K3IDRAN,Problem?
06-11-2020T01:03:45,AspiringNoodle,I'm 13 at heart :snail:
06-11-2020T01:03:53,Dadrobit,"But state laws have updated policies for traveling. It's still good for driving, but not okay for flying or buying alcohol or smokes."
06-11-2020T01:04:06,SageSaga,wait- crap - did he avoid my trap?
06-11-2020T01:04:53,johnnytho,idk
06-11-2020T01:04:55,Combak,Did who?
06-11-2020T01:04:59,BadFoMo,Your trap?
06-11-2020T01:05:18,unsteddyphoenix,Picartos R18 isnt it?
06-11-2020T01:05:24,SageSaga,yep
06-11-2020T01:05:30,Zakuru,it is?
06-11-2020T01:05:31,K3IDRAN,Si
06-11-2020T01:05:39,unsteddyphoenix,Sorry~
06-11-2020T01:05:41,Zakuru,damn ok
06-11-2020T01:05:42,SageSaga,you have to be 18 or older to make an account
06-11-2020T01:05:50,Zakuru,wow ok i didnt know that :eyes:;
06-11-2020T01:06:01,Nekonny,all done
06-11-2020T01:06:01,SageSaga,so the trap was to try and get someone to admit to being under 18
06-11-2020T01:06:06,johnnytho,hes mentioned that before many times actually
06-11-2020T01:06:06,Dadrobit,"Whew, looks like I barely made the cut then!"
06-11-2020T01:06:10,SageSaga,nothing to do with actually driving or not XD
06-11-2020T01:06:24,Zakuru,smaaart sage
06-11-2020T01:06:29,RedDragonSyndicate,nefarious Sage. I appreciate the devious approach
06-11-2020T01:06:40,johnnytho,I thought you guys knew and just tolerated it.
06-11-2020T01:06:41,Ordithus,interesting stuff Ron. Neat to see you work on 3d
06-11-2020T01:06:46,SageSaga,yo Red!

06-11-2020T01:06:58,SageSaga,Red- i did the sketch for this month already
06-11-2020T01:07:00,AspiringNoodle,"Good thing mental age doesn't count, haha"

06-11-2020T01:07:47,Combak,lol
06-11-2020T01:07:56,Combak,You know they had to add that after someone did it.
06-11-2020T01:08:10,AspiringNoodle,Nobody EVER expects Directive 4
06-11-2020T01:08:18,BadFoMo,"To Nora's Room with them! ...Wait, NO! That's for 18+ ofenders only!"
06-11-2020T01:08:45,KeefMcDerpface,So what about the ones under 18?
06-11-2020T01:08:55,Dadrobit,Be back in a bit. Gotta go have a quick chat with some folks.
06-11-2020T01:08:55,Combak,"Dissappointed kids and Nora: ""Aww!!"""
06-11-2020T01:08:57,PopularDollars,was it just me or did chat suddenly go crazy?
06-11-2020T01:09:00,AspiringNoodle,They get aged up to 18 so Nora can still have fun
06-11-2020T01:09:01,KeefMcDerpface,"The ""kid friendly"" Nora's room?"
06-11-2020T01:09:01,SageSaga,i dont actually ban people for being underage and being here of course- but it's good to know if they start being lil' turds i can report them and have their accounts deleted
06-11-2020T01:09:11,unsteddyphoenix,I do!
06-11-2020T01:09:18,SageSaga,(ive never actually done that either XD)
06-11-2020T01:09:24,AspiringNoodle,Why do we like steddy more than Ord again?
06-11-2020T01:09:32,Zakuru,soo was it a temp ban?
06-11-2020T01:09:55,johnnytho,for 2 years
06-11-2020T01:09:57,Sesarag,What size pages are the comics?
06-11-2020T01:09:57,johnnytho,lol

06-11-2020T01:10:12,unsteddyphoenix,What he said lol
06-11-2020T01:10:44,Ordithus,"noodle if you're trying to make me jelly of teddy, too late"
06-11-2020T01:10:49,Ordithus,I want those handsome looks
06-11-2020T01:11:05,SageSaga,I like Ord more than Unsteddy
06-11-2020T01:11:10,SageSaga,there- i said it
06-11-2020T01:11:15,unsteddyphoenix,D:
06-11-2020T01:11:19,unsteddyphoenix,Well
06-11-2020T01:11:24,unsteddyphoenix,I like saga more than sage
06-11-2020T01:11:25,unsteddyphoenix,So there
06-11-2020T01:11:28,SageSaga,might have to do with Ord giving me money
06-11-2020T01:11:46,unsteddyphoenix,How much to buy your loyalty
06-11-2020T01:11:54,AspiringNoodle,*gives Ord a cookie*
06-11-2020T01:11:57,AspiringNoodle,*extra LARGE*
06-11-2020T01:11:57,SageSaga,easier to like someone when they willingly aid in your survival
06-11-2020T01:12:08,unsteddyphoenix,What if I unwillingly aided
06-11-2020T01:12:27,johnnytho,Some smooth brain just bumped my fence?
06-11-2020T01:12:27,SageSaga,that would be sad
06-11-2020T01:13:33,SageSaga,Koala bear problem Johnny?
06-11-2020T01:14:02,Nekonny,I'm not sure how to solve some of these issues with the bones...
06-11-2020T01:14:03,johnnytho,neighbor cant drive
06-11-2020T01:14:12,Nekonny,like this kneepad
06-11-2020T01:14:15,SpazztasticKiwi,what a time to pop in
06-11-2020T01:14:21,AspiringNoodle,mo bones mo problems

06-11-2020T01:14:30,SpazztasticKiwi,red ain’t colored in & I legit thought he was naked
06-11-2020T01:14:40,SageSaga,Koala's are the only creatures i know that have smooth brains
06-11-2020T01:14:44,Ordithus,burnt the shorts off
06-11-2020T01:14:48,KeefMcDerpface,lol
06-11-2020T01:14:48,Zakuru,that explosion made him lose his pants
06-11-2020T01:14:57,johnnytho,Californians too Sage
06-11-2020T01:15:22,SageSaga,I know many well rigged brained Californians
06-11-2020T01:15:24,CrRAR,:ccrrar-pants2:
06-11-2020T01:15:24,Nekonny,need to find someoen more experienced in this
06-11-2020T01:15:30,Nekonny,or read though the documentations
06-11-2020T01:15:31,SageSaga,Ron- whats the issue?
06-11-2020T01:15:50,AspiringNoodle,Only about- *let me check some voting results- 43.5% of Californians have smooth brains :snail:
06-11-2020T01:15:56,Nekonny,"well, see the knee in this pic of the model I'm making"
06-11-2020T01:16:00,SageSaga,ah its double jointed
06-11-2020T01:16:03,Nekonny,it's double jointed
06-11-2020T01:16:13,Zakuru,oop
06-11-2020T01:16:16,SageSaga,whats the skeleton like?
06-11-2020T01:16:28,Nekonny,and... you can't do double jointed legs in the game
06-11-2020T01:16:50,CrRAR,"wow, nekonny achieved the unpossible"
06-11-2020T01:16:52,SageSaga,ok so you should seperate the knee part and anchor it ?
06-11-2020T01:16:55,johnnytho,Man I have hw due in 1hr 45. Goodnight ppl
06-11-2020T01:17:07,Ordithus,night johnny
06-11-2020T01:17:08,KeefMcDerpface,night johnny
06-11-2020T01:17:09,BadFoMo,Good night.
06-11-2020T01:17:15,CrRAR,yis :v: johnny
06-11-2020T01:17:42,CrRAR,did dishes
06-11-2020T01:17:44,Nekonny,doesn't work
06-11-2020T01:17:49,Nekonny,"at lest, not well"
06-11-2020T01:17:51,SageSaga,basically imagine the skeleton as normal with that knee part not there- then add in the knee so it doesnt get affected- but moves with the joint
06-11-2020T01:17:53,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-kingtea: got tea
06-11-2020T01:18:14,Nekonny,trying to find a combination of settings that more or less simulates what I'm looking for
06-11-2020T01:18:48,CrRAR,"haha, beware... the clawwwww"
06-11-2020T01:18:53,SageSaga,you want it to move with the leg but not be morphed by it right?
06-11-2020T01:19:12,Nekonny,"that ""moves with the joint part is the tough part"
06-11-2020T01:19:42,SageSaga,yeah its been a long time since ive done it- but it can be done 100%
06-11-2020T01:19:50,unsteddyphoenix,move leggy all the way up
06-11-2020T01:20:01,Ordithus,alll the way
06-11-2020T01:20:05,CrRAR,lol
06-11-2020T01:20:40,Nekonny,"see, Ive set it where it gets %50 of th emovemt of the lower leg"
06-11-2020T01:20:41,Nekonny,but
06-11-2020T01:20:44,AspiringNoodle,raise the leggy above the head
06-11-2020T01:20:51,Nekonny,it doesnt translate over to unity
06-11-2020T01:21:03,Nekonny,so I'm trying to do it with dynamic bones
06-11-2020T01:21:25,SageSaga,i dont think thats the right move
06-11-2020T01:21:59,Nekonny,I don't either; but I ran out of ideas
06-11-2020T01:22:03,SageSaga,that would introduce random movement- you just want it to move as a piece associated with but not part of the skeleton
06-11-2020T01:22:26,Combak,"Okay, I've nearly been up for 24 hours. Time for bed. Night all!"
06-11-2020T01:22:32,AspiringNoodle,Only 24?
06-11-2020T01:22:35,SageSaga,sleep well Combak
06-11-2020T01:22:36,CrRAR,:v: combak
06-11-2020T01:22:38,KeefMcDerpface,night Combak
06-11-2020T01:22:43,Nekonny,I figured it would introduce movemt when I moved
06-11-2020T01:22:43,Ordithus,night combak
06-11-2020T01:22:44,AspiringNoodle,Good night.  Let me know when you do 40 :snail:
06-11-2020T01:22:49,Nekonny,but it's not so simple
06-11-2020T01:23:00,Nekonny,I was hoping I could constrain it to an axis
06-11-2020T01:23:13,Nekonny,and then make adjustments to make it look more or less ok
06-11-2020T01:23:16,SageSaga,you should be able to
06-11-2020T01:23:20,Nekonny,but it won't work like I want
06-11-2020T01:23:39,Combak,"Thanks for the good night wishes Sage, CrRAR, Keef, Ord, Noodle."
06-11-2020T01:23:49,Combak,"And I'm pretty sure I've done 40, or something close."
06-11-2020T01:24:08,SageSaga,then you gotta look at it differently- or - look up people doing it with like pieces of armor or items that follow with a character
06-11-2020T01:24:17,AspiringNoodle,"Ah,y ou know what it's like to be drunk without being drunk then, haha"
06-11-2020T01:24:22,Nekonny,yeah
06-11-2020T01:24:27,SageSaga,like- how does a game have a character have a weapon attach to their back and move with them?
06-11-2020T01:24:36,SageSaga,you want that- but for the knee parts
06-11-2020T01:24:46,SageSaga,so it moves with them but doesnt deform
06-11-2020T01:24:52,Nekonny,"Utimately, it's not that important for it to work in game; but I learn a lot in the process"
06-11-2020T01:25:11,Nekonny,"oh I can make it static, no problem there"
06-11-2020T01:25:12,SageSaga,i cant remember what its called though - there was a name for it
06-11-2020T01:25:21,Combak,See you all Sunday!
06-11-2020T01:25:21,Nekonny,but the kneecap does need to move on it's own
06-11-2020T01:25:28,Nekonny,just not as much as the lower leg
06-11-2020T01:25:42,Nekonny,gonan head off though
06-11-2020T01:25:45,SageSaga,it should move just as the knee translates right?
06-11-2020T01:25:48,Nekonny,thnaks for the sugestions
06-11-2020T01:26:00,Nekonny,I would like to bounce some ideas off of you later
06-11-2020T01:26:07,Nekonny,yes
06-11-2020T01:26:29,Ordithus,night Ron
06-11-2020T01:26:29,SageSaga,oh- what about adding an invisible element to attach it?
06-11-2020T01:26:38,SageSaga,that was an old trick games used
06-11-2020T01:27:01,SageSaga,you just make a transparent object and attach things to that
06-11-2020T01:27:17,SageSaga,made it easy to move around on the model to adjust placement of things

06-11-2020T15:10:33,SageSaga,i bought 2 - and planned to eat one once the election was called- and the flavor was based on who won
06-11-2020T15:11:29,SageSaga,"so if Biden Won i get to eat Americone Dream, and if Trump had won - Chocolate Therapy"

06-11-2020T15:37:17,SageSaga,it's really hot in my room so i had to open a window- and i went to open my door and i had a package
06-11-2020T15:38:43,SageSaga,im surprised how good this figure is for how cheap it was- couldnt pass up such a cute Rem figure :P
06-11-2020T15:41:24,Ordithus,nice nice
06-11-2020T15:41:42,Ordithus,I just got a nice check in the mail from selling some camera gear
06-11-2020T15:43:16,SageSaga,in the mail?
06-11-2020T15:43:29,SageSaga,why not have it sent to you over the interwebs?
06-11-2020T15:44:15,Ordithus,no fee
06-11-2020T15:45:31,SageSaga,i guess there's a small convenience fee... on some transfers
06-11-2020T15:45:58,SageSaga,man - i wish i could paint cool backgrounds like Tom-
06-11-2020T15:46:28,SageSaga,"XD im looking at some refs and im like ""I bet Tom could just paint something just like that in the background here no problem"""
06-11-2020T15:47:31,Ordithus,he sure is good at backgrounds! Dedicates a lot of work to them
06-11-2020T15:48:19,SageSaga,yeah but hes built up the skill that stuff like this would be a cake walk for him- i have a lot more trouble with learning replication techniques
06-11-2020T15:48:41,SageSaga,he can look at something and just paint it after all his practice
06-11-2020T15:49:09,SageSaga,meanwhile my practice is- well not as impressive XD
06-11-2020T15:50:05,Ordithus,keep at it!
06-11-2020T15:51:38,SageSaga,i will- just fantasizing being able to do it without all the effort :P
06-11-2020T15:52:14,Ordithus,well if you don't want ANY effort just hire someone
06-11-2020T15:52:18,Ordithus,or steal it :eyes:
06-11-2020T15:53:06,SageSaga,would never steal it- and way too poor to hire XD
06-11-2020T15:54:38,SageSaga,would love to have some software that can generate fantasy/historical cities in 3D to use as backdrop references to paint over though
06-11-2020T15:57:25,AspiringNoodle,Could probably be done.
06-11-2020T15:58:52,AspiringNoodle,"You could set up some rules of thumb for procedural generation like, ""main streets should consist of x - y buildings"", a set of buildings can only have so much space in the middle of them"
06-11-2020T15:59:33,AspiringNoodle,"Could take a while, but once the basis is done, all that would be left would be modelling some stuff :snail:"
06-11-2020T15:59:33,SageSaga,ive found software to do it for modern cities but not fantasy/historical buildings

06-11-2020T16:48:50,SageSaga,you mean via rentals of locations?
06-11-2020T16:49:13,SageSaga,because that makes sense as they are a franchise

06-11-2020T16:51:13,Ordithus,"so corporate owns the restaurant land/building itself, and the franchisee pays rent?"

06-11-2020T16:52:34,AspiringNoodle,A cut of all sales (4% iirc)
06-11-2020T16:52:39,AspiringNoodle,And rent
06-11-2020T16:53:43,AspiringNoodle,"Although, I definitely contradict myself since McD's does cover a lot of costs.  I presume that they actually pay for building the building (which can be a tax write-off)"
06-11-2020T16:54:25,Ordithus,it's not like the franchise gets nothing out of the relationship
06-11-2020T16:54:30,AspiringNoodle,"I know a few years ago when McDonalds was reinventing its look to be more modern / contemporary, if locations renovated to meet the new look before a certain date, corporate would cover all the costs"

06-11-2020T16:55:02,AspiringNoodle,I think I'm taking a masterclass from matPat on this front

06-11-2020T17:55:44,AspiringNoodle,She has a permanent resting grumpy face
06-11-2020T17:55:53,AspiringNoodle,"""Begone peasant, leave me be."""

06-11-2020T18:01:09,SageSaga,was there some context i missed?
06-11-2020T18:05:56,SageSaga,@aspiringNoodle ?
06-11-2020T18:06:15,AspiringNoodle,"In general, what happens during another country's election is that country's business (I was doing something in WoW, sorry xD)"

06-11-2020T18:07:59,SageSaga,you do realize that one of the most important roles for the president is foreign relations
06-11-2020T18:08:00,AspiringNoodle,I'm not particularly a fan of that.
06-11-2020T18:08:21,AspiringNoodle,"What Xexa said, not Sage"
06-11-2020T18:08:39,Rosscoe,"I dunno what is up with Picarto's not notifiing people again, least I got some time tonight to watch while I paint walls XD"

06-11-2020T18:09:43,Rosscoe,Sage a good boi
06-11-2020T18:10:16,CrRAR,"yeah states' laws get messy because everyone has different opinions and legislative structure in different states, it's true that many issues are not one-size-fits all Federal solutions."

06-11-2020T18:10:44,CrRAR,"sadly most ""bad"" state legislation stays in place simple because of the ""well we always did it that way"" phenomenon"
06-11-2020T18:10:49,Dadrobit,just have chat open on second monitor.
06-11-2020T18:11:07,Dadrobit,He's doing a charity stream for kids.

06-11-2020T18:12:42,Dadrobit,Play support and don't fuck up
06-11-2020T18:12:55,Dadrobit,"And if you do fuck up, then /muteall"

06-11-2020T18:13:40,Dadrobit,The Yuumi pick gave it away
06-11-2020T18:14:57,AspiringNoodle,*sigh* Maybe I just need to be more open minded...

06-11-2020T18:21:53,CrRAR,"states do need to make SOME decisions for themselves, but like minimum wage has taught us it goes the OTHER wat too when the Federal gov't doesn't update past 7.25 xD"
06-11-2020T18:22:08,AspiringNoodle,Indeed
06-11-2020T18:22:36,CrRAR,"so like, I guess what the vid concludes is right, activism is the best answer."

06-11-2020T18:49:51,Ordithus,sometimes I think that would have been the way to go
06-11-2020T18:50:01,Rosscoe,So far I sunk........about over 3000 in total into my house so far in the past year and counting
06-11-2020T18:50:08,Ordithus,probably would have cost less over these past two years
06-11-2020T18:50:13,Rosscoe,"Dont worry Sage, the warhammers come later"
06-11-2020T18:50:42,Rosscoe,"And no, I painted the upper section of the wood white, the cinder blocks are red for whoever asked XD"

06-11-2020T23:31:08,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s a  f e d e r a l crime
06-11-2020T23:31:25,AspiringNoodle,Good ol' IP rights :D
06-11-2020T23:31:36,SpazztasticKiwi,or at least a crime - they will fine the store and take our license to that company’s designs away
06-11-2020T23:31:47,SpazztasticKiwi,$2000 fine

06-11-2020T23:35:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"ok. your kid has needs - I can understand that but I’ll be frank and say outright that I don’t care, this is a crime you’re asking me to commit & whole no they can’t copyright the colors that’s not the argument"
06-11-2020T23:35:37,SpazztasticKiwi,you want the design of and the characters themselves along with the colors
06-11-2020T23:36:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"if colors were copyrighted we’d only have so many designs period in the world - “nope can’t use blue for the baby shower, that’s disneys”"

06-11-2020T23:38:35,SpazztasticKiwi,she is

06-11-2020T23:39:18,SpazztasticKiwi,she just doesn’t discipline  or watch them worth a damn
06-11-2020T23:39:49,SpazztasticKiwi,as little shelf shaker satan clearly showed
06-11-2020T23:40:32,CrRAR,m e n a c e
06-11-2020T23:41:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"before that, I spotted her at the cooler paying no mind to the fact one of the boys was running off with the cart"
06-11-2020T23:41:19,CrRAR,Demolition derby?
06-11-2020T23:41:21,SpazztasticKiwi,that had two other kids in it
06-11-2020T23:42:02,SpazztasticKiwi,they’re wanderers
06-11-2020T23:42:21,CrRAR,He gave them as offerings to the sporting goods dept no doubt
06-11-2020T23:42:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"and if they’re bored, they entertain themselves by going on an adventure or messing with stuff"
06-11-2020T23:43:02,CrRAR,or went on their own personal supermarket sweep episode
06-11-2020T23:43:27,Ordithus,through the homewares and smash all the dishes
06-11-2020T23:43:43,SpazztasticKiwi,she’s even been caught screaming at them to “sit their $@&! asses down”
06-11-2020T23:43:53,CrRAR,spoons on pans wild
06-11-2020T23:44:09,SpazztasticKiwi,because that’s how you tend to special needs children
06-11-2020T23:44:18,Ordithus,not a wholesome family this
06-11-2020T23:44:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"if they are special needs, I feel bad for them"
06-11-2020T23:45:08,Ordithus,even if not
06-11-2020T23:45:47,SpazztasticKiwi,because she’s not attentive & if it effects their learning or social or just their basic function skills like manners
06-11-2020T23:46:14,SpazztasticKiwi,she’s can’t be helping them well
06-11-2020T23:46:19,SpazztasticKiwi,she

06-11-2020T23:47:14,SpazztasticKiwi,they don’t seem to me like they’re that bad tho
06-11-2020T23:48:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"except for shelf shaker satan, there’s not a whole lot the do aside from wondering off or playing “pick it up and ogle it for a few minutes”"
06-11-2020T23:48:28,SpazztasticKiwi,they
06-11-2020T23:49:17,SpazztasticKiwi,or smushing up against the glass to the hot case
06-11-2020T23:49:31,SpazztasticKiwi,kids like to do that anyway tho
06-11-2020T23:49:41,Ordithus,some adults probably too
06-11-2020T23:50:12,SpazztasticKiwi,nah the glass is face level for a kid
06-11-2020T23:51:05,SpazztasticKiwi,adults will fingerprint it but kids all but play fingerpaints with their face
06-11-2020T23:52:05,SpazztasticKiwi,you’ll get the occasional parent that’s like “don’t touch the glass it’s hot” in that Mary poppins voice
06-11-2020T23:52:34,SpazztasticKiwi,& those that’ll tell em don’t touch it because of fingerprints
06-11-2020T23:53:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"or who knows they don’t want their kids hands, that go in their mouths every few minutes, to touch something waist/crotch level for most adults & a good amount of people touch daily"
06-11-2020T23:54:43,AspiringNoodle,"Sadly, most kids learn by doing"
06-11-2020T23:54:59,AspiringNoodle,"Tell them something's hot a 1000 times, but eventually touch it and burn themselves"
06-11-2020T23:55:36,SpazztasticKiwi,one parent skipped the sweet “don’t touch that”/“that’s hot” warning or shooing away with the hand
06-11-2020T23:56:03,SpazztasticKiwi,just “dontyoutouchthatglass”
06-11-2020T23:56:30,SpazztasticKiwi,that I’ll skin you alive tone
06-11-2020T23:56:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"well, the kid didn’t touch it"
06-11-2020T23:56:43,AspiringNoodle,"But they probably won't learn why, lol"
06-11-2020T23:57:27,Ordithus,least the glass isn't like a stovetop or something
