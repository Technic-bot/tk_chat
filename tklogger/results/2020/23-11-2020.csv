23-11-2020T16:29:36,tehbear,and spooked him off the road?

23-11-2020T23:11:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll talk about the mushroom swiss burger I tried today
23-11-2020T23:12:05,CrRAR,"Honestly, the more baked goods in the world the better"
23-11-2020T23:12:07,SpazztasticKiwi,not as good as the steakhouse
23-11-2020T23:12:23,CrRAR,You’re on a spree!
23-11-2020T23:12:36,CrRAR,Were the mushrooms too soggy?
23-11-2020T23:12:42,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe because the onions weren’t right or it had gravy instead of the aioli
23-11-2020T23:12:42,CrRAR,That’s the worst
23-11-2020T23:13:00,SpazztasticKiwi,but both need more mushrooms
23-11-2020T23:13:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I might’ve been ok with a mushroom only sandwich if they had the cheese aioli & toast
23-11-2020T23:14:02,Ordithus,I've had a few mean mushroom melts
23-11-2020T23:14:06,Ordithus,so good
23-11-2020T23:14:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I haven’t stopped thinking about that guy who cooked deep fried cheese stuffed mushrooms
23-11-2020T23:15:01,CrRAR,Avacado aioli is pretty great
23-11-2020T23:15:13,CrRAR,Not even need to be deepfried
23-11-2020T23:15:24,CrRAR,just bake w/ butter
23-11-2020T23:15:52,SpazztasticKiwi,yes cheese stuffed mushrooms sounds just as good without deep frying it
23-11-2020T23:16:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw he also tried egg filled baked avocado
23-11-2020T23:16:49,Ordithus,interesting
23-11-2020T23:17:01,SpazztasticKiwi,tasty made egg stuffed tomato omelettes
23-11-2020T23:17:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I should marry a chef
23-11-2020T23:18:03,CrRAR,good strategy

23-11-2020T23:18:35,CrRAR,:knife::ccrrar-chickcr:
23-11-2020T23:18:43,SpazztasticKiwi,avocado sliced or chopped on a sandwich with the regular cheese meat lettuce & tomato
23-11-2020T23:18:57,SpazztasticKiwi,no need for mayo or mustard
23-11-2020T23:19:17,CrRAR,Grind it mash it mix it with oil!
