29-07-2020T00:02:04,Dadrobit,About 1 minute in you get to see the final climb.
29-07-2020T00:02:08,CrRAR,"ahh yeah, you know the end is nigh when most trails go vertical"
29-07-2020T00:02:26,CrRAR,Like the Crag fromm DoubleDare xD
29-07-2020T00:03:05,CrRAR,*Rocky theme plays*
29-07-2020T00:03:12,Dadrobit,"Flatiron peak from earlier does it as well, but it's only about 10 or so vertical feet. 4 Peaks does some real shit at the end."
29-07-2020T00:04:09,Dadrobit,Double Datre.
29-07-2020T00:04:13,Dadrobit,Dare
29-07-2020T00:04:25,Dadrobit,Now that's a name I haven't hear in a long time...
29-07-2020T00:04:30,Dadrobit,Heard*
29-07-2020T00:04:53,CrRAR,"Yeah, both Lafayette and the Tripyramids in NH have some freaky approaches."
29-07-2020T00:05:16,CrRAR,"The Tripyramids literally have an approach called ""The Slide"""
29-07-2020T00:05:37,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/y72I6HY.jpg that's the flatiron wall.
29-07-2020T00:05:38,CrRAR,It's exposed bedrock at like a pretty almost vertical angle
29-07-2020T00:05:59,CrRAR,oh wow yeah
29-07-2020T00:07:27,Dadrobit,From there it's an easy walk to the peak from earlier. Whole top of the area is flat.
29-07-2020T00:07:52,Dadrobit,Like a little reward for making it :)
29-07-2020T00:11:23,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúif you don‚Äôt do your homework you‚Äôll end up at mcdonalds‚Äù

29-07-2020T00:11:50,SpazztasticKiwi,wait
29-07-2020T00:12:29,AspiringNoodle,"""Joke's on you, did my homework, still work at McDonald's."""
29-07-2020T00:12:29,SpazztasticKiwi,the logic is possible

29-07-2020T00:15:38,AspiringNoodle,"If you think it's bad now, wait until the ""college = success"" generation(s) have enough"
29-07-2020T00:16:03,Dadrobit,"No joke, I am worried about my nieces and nephews."
29-07-2020T00:16:36,AspiringNoodle,Yeah...
29-07-2020T00:16:40,CrRAR,"yeah like with the diminishing return of a college education like and the spreading awareness of that, ohhh boyyyy,"
29-07-2020T00:16:48,AspiringNoodle,shrinking job market + wage stagnation + skyrocketing college costs = bad time
29-07-2020T00:17:02,Dadrobit,"""Highschool diploma"" jobs are going the way of the dodo from automation and contracting, and the bachelor's is the new bare minimum...."
29-07-2020T00:17:10,AspiringNoodle,Not to mention unemployement is a freaking joke
29-07-2020T00:17:10,CrRAR,Like this whole current situation is scary too for recent graduates
29-07-2020T00:17:18,CrRAR,yup
29-07-2020T00:17:33,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the stupidest thing you‚Äôve done for money?‚Äù
29-07-2020T00:17:40,AspiringNoodle,"So, I graduated in 2018"
29-07-2020T00:17:42,SpazztasticKiwi,graduate college
29-07-2020T00:17:43,Dadrobit,I thought I was fucked graduating right after the crash of 08...
29-07-2020T00:17:51,CrRAR,yeah
29-07-2020T00:18:03,AspiringNoodle,And I haven't really bothered even looking at programming jobs during this whole pandemic...
29-07-2020T00:18:04,CrRAR,to be fair I got a job in the pit of that in 2013
29-07-2020T00:18:10,Dadrobit,"I mean, I'm still fucked. But slightly less so."
29-07-2020T00:18:16,CrRAR,so all hope not lost
29-07-2020T00:18:43,Dadrobit,Legit the only reason I have a supervisors gig/pay is because I was convenient.
29-07-2020T00:19:10,Dadrobit,"And just last quarterly meeting, we got threatened with automation. I shit you not."
29-07-2020T00:19:15,AspiringNoodle,"If automation ever takes out the trucking industry, god help us all..."
29-07-2020T00:19:18,CrRAR,"I just feel like and I know all the hate ""free college"" gets, at SOME POINT in history society decided that K-12 should be a right afforded to EVERYONE and at some point I feel like society needs to put on its big boy pants and make the same judgement"
29-07-2020T00:19:23,CrRAR,about college
29-07-2020T00:19:28,AspiringNoodle,^^^
29-07-2020T00:19:42,SpazztasticKiwi,convenient father figure?
29-07-2020T00:19:53,Dadrobit,"""You know, we don't really NEED a live person doing this, we CHOOSE to have you here. So shape up!"""
29-07-2020T00:20:06,AspiringNoodle,"College is costly because it's considered ""higher education""."
29-07-2020T00:20:16,AspiringNoodle,Something you go to to get trained for a better job
29-07-2020T00:20:18,CrRAR,yeah but now it's been devalued
29-07-2020T00:20:30,AspiringNoodle,"But if EVERY job now requires a degree, what does that say?"
29-07-2020T00:20:37,AspiringNoodle,"It's no longer a choice, it's a requirement..."
29-07-2020T00:20:46,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ùóÔ∏èNibbly in a tiny suit
29-07-2020T00:20:48,Dadrobit,"I had worked there previously, Spazz as a regular guard. Asked for my job back and they were desperate to fill a supervisor slot."
29-07-2020T00:20:59,AspiringNoodle,"Imagine if you had to pay for high school, with jobs requiring a GED or high school diploma"
29-07-2020T00:21:04,CrRAR,"yeah, as a society paying for the advancement of the youth is an investment in the future of a nation"
29-07-2020T00:21:26,AspiringNoodle,Sadly the financial sector will lobby to torpedo the HELL out of that notion
29-07-2020T00:21:34,CrRAR,yeah I kno
29-07-2020T00:21:37,Dadrobit,"Yeah, and support at least in AZ was cut waaaaaay back for helping kids through college a few years ago."
29-07-2020T00:21:40,AspiringNoodle,Don't wanna stop making sweet bank on those un-bankruptable student loans :P
29-07-2020T00:22:07,AspiringNoodle,Which by itself is rather stupid...
29-07-2020T00:22:32,Dadrobit,"If you got scores of ""Exceeding"" on your state exams, Arizona used to pay 100% of your bachelor's degree."
29-07-2020T00:22:36,SpazztasticKiwi,or a tiny bow tie
29-07-2020T00:22:37,Dadrobit,Completely gone now
29-07-2020T00:22:49,Dadrobit,I was the last year they did that program
29-07-2020T00:22:53,AspiringNoodle,This was a subject in my one english course back in community college
29-07-2020T00:23:00,CrRAR,Maybe Sythe as squirrel can get a bow tie?
29-07-2020T00:23:15,CrRAR,dapper squirrel boi
29-07-2020T00:23:18,AspiringNoodle,Our professor was raising the heck out of awareness of PA cutting back support for local uni's and colleges
29-07-2020T00:23:25,AspiringNoodle,So our tuition rates will go up
29-07-2020T00:23:32,SpazztasticKiwi,then Nibbly materializes in a brides dress
29-07-2020T00:23:43,CrRAR,hehehe
29-07-2020T00:23:53,Dadrobit,You'd think the prices would go down. But no.
29-07-2020T00:23:54,CrRAR,They can be wedding Cake Toppers!
29-07-2020T00:24:09,AspiringNoodle,It is downright retarded that governments are cutting funding for making college affordable
29-07-2020T00:24:10,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúding ding ding do I hear wedding bells‚Äù
29-07-2020T00:24:23,AspiringNoodle,But then more and more jobs *require* degrees on their application
29-07-2020T00:24:41,CrRAR,some are removing it though
29-07-2020T00:24:42,SpazztasticKiwi,and then Maren catches the bouquet
29-07-2020T00:24:53,Dadrobit,"Instead of cutting the cost of entry to entice more people and diversify, they simply charge more on the market they have left."
29-07-2020T00:24:54,CrRAR,dunno if that actually helps the non-degree ppl tho
29-07-2020T00:24:54,AspiringNoodle,"True rar, but so far that seems limited to the tech sector"
29-07-2020T00:24:57,SpazztasticKiwi,da da daaaa
29-07-2020T00:25:03,CrRAR,hahaha
29-07-2020T00:25:21,AspiringNoodle,Companies like Google and Apple are putting skills over paper
29-07-2020T00:25:44,AspiringNoodle,"But honestly, the degree craze is a larger overall trend of companies not being as willing to train their employees anymore"
29-07-2020T00:25:57,CrRAR,"yeah, the smart places realize accomplishments beat out fancy stuff"
29-07-2020T00:25:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"Sythe‚Äôs younger, sheltered brother comes to the wedding"
29-07-2020T00:26:08,AspiringNoodle,"At some point: Degree came to mean ""we won't need to train this person to do their job."" Which was an outright lie"
29-07-2020T00:26:11,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúHachet‚Äù
29-07-2020T00:26:17,SpazztasticKiwi,ü•Å
29-07-2020T00:26:18,CrRAR,pfhh
29-07-2020T00:26:30,AspiringNoodle,"So then on top of a degree, places started requiring experience"
29-07-2020T00:26:43,Dadrobit,"Whoa, I thought you were being serious for a second there, like there was a character I was unaware of somehow?"
29-07-2020T00:26:48,SpazztasticKiwi,caaaan you feeel the loooove toniiiight üé∂
29-07-2020T00:26:56,AspiringNoodle,It is an absolute JOKE that computer science positions at companies require 2 - 4 years of experience for an ENTRY LEVEL position
29-07-2020T00:27:26,AspiringNoodle,"At some point, the economy will just explode"
29-07-2020T00:27:39,AspiringNoodle,And COVID is probably pressing the accelerator on that path
29-07-2020T00:27:50,Dadrobit,Implode*
29-07-2020T00:27:50,CrRAR,sometimes that stuff is a wish list
29-07-2020T00:27:55,CrRAR,yus
29-07-2020T00:28:52,SpazztasticKiwi,you‚Äôd need a tabbed index for all the characters let alone their families
29-07-2020T00:28:55,AspiringNoodle,Sometimes I feel like it would be better if the economy just imploded
29-07-2020T00:29:10,CrRAR,better for younger generation
29-07-2020T00:29:11,AspiringNoodle,Because then we would be forced to address everything wrong
29-07-2020T00:29:15,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe Tom would do something with giving Sythe a brother or maybe he has one who knows
29-07-2020T00:29:27,AspiringNoodle,Instead of just lazily dragging it out for decades as conditions continue to worsen
29-07-2020T00:29:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"rn, everybody‚Äôs too focused drooling on Erilas‚Äôs chapter"
29-07-2020T00:30:01,AspiringNoodle,She busty :3
29-07-2020T00:30:13,CrRAR,Erilas' VOLUMINOUS chapter~
29-07-2020T00:30:16,Dadrobit,"No, noodle. It would not be good. The people who caused it will skate free like they did in 08 and everyone else will be fucked into ""addressing everything wrong""."
29-07-2020T00:30:16,SpazztasticKiwi,yes...I know
29-07-2020T00:30:34,SpazztasticKiwi,very well....how fascinating
29-07-2020T00:30:41,AspiringNoodle,"Maybe not Dadro.  Not if the increasing ""eat the rich"" sentiment is anything to go by xD"
29-07-2020T00:30:54,AspiringNoodle,"It's a rather disturbing thought, though..."
29-07-2020T00:31:02,SpazztasticKiwi,aiight imma head out

29-07-2020T00:33:05,AspiringNoodle,"jesus, just saw Trevor Noah"

29-07-2020T00:33:22,CrRAR,quarin-fro
29-07-2020T00:34:05,AspiringNoodle,"Anyways... at some point the world will need to come together and agree on one thing, the rich have too much wealth, lol"
29-07-2020T00:34:25,AspiringNoodle,We honestly have no idea how much money corporations and wealthy individuals have hidden away in foreign tax havens.
29-07-2020T00:35:13,CrRAR,yeah which damages money supply
29-07-2020T00:35:18,Dadrobit,I think Trevor Noah is the only interview I didn't like with Andre Yang iirc.
29-07-2020T00:35:26,Dadrobit,Andrew*
29-07-2020T00:35:31,AspiringNoodle,#YangGang :D
29-07-2020T00:35:46,Dadrobit,It felt stilted and forced.
29-07-2020T00:36:03,Dadrobit,Though I know he did/does good stuff otherwise.
29-07-2020T00:36:06,AspiringNoodle,"Funny how everyone laughed at UBI, but now that the pandemic is here, people be like, ""Hmmm.... doesn't sound that bad after all..."""

29-07-2020T00:36:55,AspiringNoodle,We honestly don't know how far automation will go
29-07-2020T00:37:24,CrRAR,"yeah, if we're moving toward a more in-nation manufacturing model, subsidized incomes will probably be needed"
29-07-2020T00:37:26,AspiringNoodle,"But wherever automation goes, it destroys more jobs than it creates, and the companies (aka bourgeiosie) make out like a bandit"
29-07-2020T00:37:33,CrRAR,yup
29-07-2020T00:37:50,Dadrobit,We know Covid is advancing it a bunch in America. That's for sure.
29-07-2020T00:37:54,AspiringNoodle,Tim Pool actually covers why the Fight for Fifteen is stupid
29-07-2020T00:38:03,AspiringNoodle,But ironically ends up making a case for UBI
29-07-2020T00:38:33,CrRAR,"Like Farming is subsidized because food supply, manufacturing soon will need to be subsidized to provide good lifestyle wages to produce things but keep costs low maybe?"
29-07-2020T00:38:39,Dadrobit,"Lotsa folks put out of a job are getting calls ""we actually don't have a position for you here anymore."""
29-07-2020T00:38:43,AspiringNoodle,"I know this, my family knows this, and so do a lot of other people, if you increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour, it's gonna cost a lot of businesses (who operate on slim margins) an arm and a leg"

29-07-2020T00:39:08,CrRAR,"Yeah, oh our corporate just made emergency cuts"
29-07-2020T00:39:12,AspiringNoodle,Let's say McDonald's is giving someone $10 an hour
29-07-2020T00:39:31,AspiringNoodle,"If they work full time, that's ~$20,000 a year they cost the company, not including benefits"
29-07-2020T00:39:38,Dadrobit,"And the big businesses are just incentivised to hire fewer people either by contracting out, or automating."
29-07-2020T00:39:46,AspiringNoodle,"At $15, that goes up to $30,000"
29-07-2020T00:39:49,CrRAR,yeah
29-07-2020T00:40:11,AspiringNoodle,"And let's say a self-serve kiosk costs $15,000 - $20,000"
29-07-2020T00:40:28,AspiringNoodle,It was easier to just keep the full time cashier because you'd pay out over time
29-07-2020T00:40:29,Dadrobit,McDonalds will be fine. Automatic burger flipper are coming!
29-07-2020T00:41:03,AspiringNoodle,"But if cashier is now going to cost 50 - 100% more over the machine a year, you might as well bite the bullet, pay the money up front, and let the person go"
29-07-2020T00:41:14,Dadrobit,(I'm actually secretly excited for automated fast food. Quality control is gonna go way way up)
29-07-2020T00:41:31,AspiringNoodle,I already use self-serve kiosks when I go to McDonald's
29-07-2020T00:41:52,CrRAR,yeah no order takers
29-07-2020T00:41:59,AspiringNoodle,"I don't have to deal with anxiety about holding up the line, or making the cashier wait"
29-07-2020T00:42:05,CrRAR,tho they typically do double-duty
29-07-2020T00:42:15,Dadrobit,"Same, but meal prep is still people who largely don't give a shit about their job."
29-07-2020T00:42:42,CrRAR,"haha, patties go *plap*"
29-07-2020T00:42:45,AspiringNoodle,"Not to mention with the self-serve kiosks, I get an idea of how much customization you can do"
29-07-2020T00:42:49,Dadrobit,Anyone Manning a till and taking orders is usually just the shift manager now.
29-07-2020T00:42:58,CrRAR,true
29-07-2020T00:43:14,AspiringNoodle,"Also, let's not forget that jobs are more and more obsessing over ""productivity"""
29-07-2020T00:43:21,Dadrobit,"Cuts out time on the 'i want to speak to a manager"" customers as well."
29-07-2020T00:43:27,AspiringNoodle,They cut down the amount of people working but expect productivity to stay the same or go up
29-07-2020T00:43:35,AspiringNoodle,"Aka, the people still working there have to work harder"
29-07-2020T00:44:12,AspiringNoodle,"Also, eff Karens xD"
29-07-2020T00:45:00,AspiringNoodle,Imagine how much nicer retail would be if every business ever made an agreement to tell the a-hole customers to get their shiz together
29-07-2020T00:45:22,CrRAR,eh just give the upset one coupons
29-07-2020T00:45:32,AspiringNoodle,"Yes, we must reward the temper tantrums"

29-07-2020T02:06:47,Dadrobit,It's only bad when your relief doesn't show up and you have to stay however long is required to find a replacement. Up to 16.
29-07-2020T02:07:01,CrimsonQuill,How often does that happen?
29-07-2020T02:07:03,Dadrobit,Torque knows...
29-07-2020T02:07:27,Dadrobit,A full 16? Rare. An extra 2-4 at least twice a month.

29-07-2020T02:08:48,Dadrobit,Security has ridiculous turnover. Most folks don't last a.month before quitting. Scheduling is impossible.
29-07-2020T02:08:59,Dadrobit,o/ Noodle
29-07-2020T02:09:06,AspiringNoodle,...unstable schedule?
29-07-2020T02:09:15,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, why I turned down the site supervisor position they tried to offer me."
29-07-2020T02:09:30,TorqueEmUp,"Because if I couldn't get someone to fill, I had to fill it myself."
29-07-2020T02:09:36,AspiringNoodle,"I ask because when I was accidentally scheduled full time at the gas station (before requesting two static days off), I regularly got only a single day off at varying intervals"
29-07-2020T02:09:36,Dadrobit,"Yeah, being always on call sucks dick"
29-07-2020T02:10:04,Dadrobit,But $30~ an hour is a really nice paycheck....
29-07-2020T02:10:19,CrimsonQuill,"Damn, that is a decent check."
29-07-2020T02:10:25,AspiringNoodle,The worst was when I worked 7 days in a row.  And I think had only gotten a single day off after working 3 in a row before that
29-07-2020T02:10:30,Dadrobit,In a state where $11 is minimum wage.
29-07-2020T02:10:45,AspiringNoodle,"Also, the job isn't that physically demanding, right?"
29-07-2020T02:10:52,TorqueEmUp,"Must be nice, my best was at Menards doing security, and that was a little over a a third of that."
29-07-2020T02:10:58,Dadrobit,Only when I'm dancing.

29-07-2020T02:15:25,Dadrobit,"Thanksgiving is a bad example, I'm always scheduled for Thanksgiving..."
29-07-2020T02:15:36,TorqueEmUp,Now I make about $20-25/hr working Dinner hours doing DoorDash.
29-07-2020T02:15:40,Dadrobit,But July 4th or Christmas!
29-07-2020T02:16:15,TorqueEmUp,can take whatever time off I want.
29-07-2020T02:16:18,CrimsonQuill,I get ‚Ç¨10 an hour (double pay when I work the Sunday shift)
29-07-2020T02:16:37,CrimsonQuill,My schedule's pretty much the same every fortnight...
29-07-2020T02:17:50,Dadrobit,Are Sundays always overtime for you? Or do they just consider Sunday to be special enough for extra money?
29-07-2020T02:18:05,CrimsonQuill,They consider Sunday to be special enough for extra.
29-07-2020T02:18:19,CrimsonQuill,It's a Nursing home run by the Sisters of Nazareth

29-07-2020T02:20:32,CrimsonQuill,@TorqueEmUp What allows for special permit?
29-07-2020T02:21:23,TorqueEmUp,"No idea, I just remember from a Top Gear episode they were on a roadtrip through Italy and I guess it happened to be a Sunday, and the police saw the film crew and everything and pulled them over."

29-07-2020T02:33:27,TorqueEmUp,and most of them probably Nissan Versas and Sentras

29-07-2020T02:35:16,TorqueEmUp,"and the engine was loud and buzzy, and not a pleasant buzzy."
29-07-2020T02:35:35,TorqueEmUp,about the only good thing to say about it was the gas mileage.
29-07-2020T02:36:15,Dadrobit,Drove my parent's Equinox the past few days while my Focus was in the shop. Interior was bleh at best as well.
29-07-2020T02:36:17,TorqueEmUp,"my folks also said the steering wandered around on the highway, especially in the rain, and hydroplaned like crazy."
29-07-2020T02:36:57,Dadrobit,"Hard plastic everywhere, and any cushion was maybe a cm deep covered in more plastic."

29-07-2020T02:38:30,TorqueEmUp,GM is not quality plastic
29-07-2020T02:38:41,Dadrobit,"Sorry, but armrests better be cushioned."
29-07-2020T02:38:49,TorqueEmUp,That I will agree on.
29-07-2020T02:40:01,CrimsonQuill,ditto
29-07-2020T02:40:38,TorqueEmUp,Wish my center arm rest in my 08 Focus has a little more padding. Little too thin.
29-07-2020T02:41:01,TorqueEmUp,Well center arm rest/center console lid.
29-07-2020T02:41:23,Dadrobit,Have an 06 and the center lid has plenty at least imo

29-07-2020T02:48:32,Dadrobit,(I may have accidentally been speeding at one in the morning while I was alone on the freeway a bit ago)
29-07-2020T02:49:03,TorqueEmUp,"I haven't tested the top speed yet on mine, I am willing to bet there might be a nanny speed governor on like my folk's Fusion."
29-07-2020T02:49:20,CrimsonQuill,I can't drive yet XD
29-07-2020T02:49:28,CrimsonQuill,Well...I can drive a tractor....
29-07-2020T02:49:55,Dadrobit,"75 in third gear with two more still to come? Yeah, this isn't gonna get me in trouble AT ALL!"
29-07-2020T02:50:26,CrimsonQuill,Flash Flash goes speed camera
29-07-2020T02:50:41,Dadrobit,Dunno how fast it'll go still. 125 is just when I noticed how fast I was going accidentally.
29-07-2020T02:50:47,TorqueEmUp,"Mine has the PZEV package installed, so it's down 10HP over a base 2.0 Duratech."
29-07-2020T02:50:52,Dadrobit,Speedo goes to 150
29-07-2020T02:51:14,TorqueEmUp,Still does 0-60 in 8 seconds
29-07-2020T02:51:16,CrimsonQuill,...Kilometres or miles?
29-07-2020T02:51:32,TorqueEmUp,'murican miles
29-07-2020T02:51:36,Dadrobit,No speed cameras on the freeway. They got taken down after a bunch of complaints and one of the technicians got killed in a drive by shooting.
29-07-2020T02:51:43,Dadrobit,MPH
29-07-2020T02:52:20,CrimsonQuill,Wait...a technician for the Speed cameras was shot?! And what complaints?
29-07-2020T02:52:25,Dadrobit,Evero speeds out here when the snowbirds are gone.
29-07-2020T02:52:31,Dadrobit,Everyone*
29-07-2020T02:52:51,Dadrobit,Complaints about getting tickets for speeding.
29-07-2020T02:53:30,Dadrobit,"If you're not doing at least 5 mph over, people are cursing for you to get off the freeway."
29-07-2020T02:53:51,TorqueEmUp,that's pretty much everywhere in the U.S :p
29-07-2020T02:53:52,Dadrobit,75 in the 65 is the flow.
29-07-2020T02:54:20,CrimsonQuill,"As in, people complained that they got tickets, or tickets were given to wrong people?"
29-07-2020T02:54:22,CrimsonQuill,...
29-07-2020T02:54:38,TorqueEmUp,probably both
29-07-2020T02:54:42,TorqueEmUp,mainly the former
29-07-2020T02:55:06,Dadrobit,Mostly just that they got caught.
29-07-2020T02:55:10,TorqueEmUp,"Because fuck speed cameras, they do nothing but generate revenue."
29-07-2020T02:55:10,CrimsonQuill,...You're not allowed to complain about speeding tickets here...
29-07-2020T02:55:32,CrimsonQuill,Because if you were speeding you were speeding...And most of ours are in accident hotspots.
29-07-2020T02:55:48,CrimsonQuill,"There are camera vans too, just in case"
29-07-2020T02:55:49,Dadrobit,"But no joke, the loop 101 and 202 are the goddamn Autobahn sometimes. 85 and folks will still be passing."
29-07-2020T02:56:03,CrimsonQuill,Jesus Mary and Joseph save us
29-07-2020T02:56:18,TorqueEmUp,Still like to see the actual statistics of those cameras and if they actual do help prevent accidents.
29-07-2020T02:56:27,Dadrobit,"The US 60 isn't quite as bad, the flow almost never hits 80"
29-07-2020T02:56:33,CrimsonQuill,Hmm...
29-07-2020T02:57:04,TorqueEmUp,Every time i've heard about the statistics there is little to no effect.
29-07-2020T02:57:15,TorqueEmUp,It's all just to make more money
29-07-2020T02:57:27,Dadrobit,Then the snowbirds come in their giant RVs and do 10mph UNDER the speed limit. Holy shit the angry driving that happens in the winter here.
29-07-2020T02:57:56,CrimsonQuill,They should do that Topgear Africa challenge where they have to drive through Botswana in 2wd cars
29-07-2020T02:58:26,CrimsonQuill,The BBC Set that challenge to prove that people in Surrey don't need a 4wd car just because a road occassionally has leaves on it
29-07-2020T02:59:03,Dadrobit,"Yeah, Torque. I think that was a primary argument against the cameras here. A technician got killed and the cameras had otherwise done nothing to help lower accidents, they just pissed people off"
29-07-2020T03:00:10,TorqueEmUp,"Same thing around here, they tried to put in some along with redlight cameras."
29-07-2020T03:00:22,Dadrobit,"There are still a few physically around, but they're all disabled. The cops are just left to set traps themselves."
29-07-2020T03:00:24,TorqueEmUp,Ohio laws states a Officer has to issue the ticket.
29-07-2020T03:00:34,TorqueEmUp,a camera can't
29-07-2020T03:00:54,TorqueEmUp,so they couldn't actually enforce any of the tickets they were sending people.
29-07-2020T03:01:13,TorqueEmUp,You could just tear it up and throw it in the trash. :P
29-07-2020T03:01:37,Dadrobit,"Honestly the cops don't even give out speeding tickets even then, just warnings. The only tickets are for speeding in residential areas, (that's good) and for people driving like assholes"
29-07-2020T03:02:07,CrimsonQuill,I see
29-07-2020T03:02:10,TorqueEmUp,"Hmm well I've got a couple speeding tickets myself, mostly from State Troopers, but they are anal here in ohio."
29-07-2020T03:02:50,Dadrobit,I remember my brother and I getting pulled over YEARS ago for doing 115. Cop cited us for 85 and gave us a warning.
29-07-2020T03:05:08,Dadrobit,And we know he caught us doing 115 because he mentioned that we pulled through the Forest Area when we got on the freeway. So he was obviously tailing us the whole time.
29-07-2020T03:05:21,Dadrobit,Gore Area*
29-07-2020T03:05:39,Dadrobit,Brother nearly pissed himself
29-07-2020T03:05:49,CrimsonQuill,Was it that scary?
29-07-2020T03:06:24,Dadrobit,We were teenagers getting pulled over by a cop for doing nearly twice the speed limit on a freeway.
29-07-2020T03:06:35,Dadrobit,Fucking terrifying
29-07-2020T03:07:53,TorqueEmUp,I still get anxious as all hell when a cop pulls me over.
29-07-2020T03:08:00,Dadrobit,"I think I was only 12 at the time, maybe 13."
29-07-2020T03:08:20,TorqueEmUp,that feeling where it feels like your junk pulls itself up into your body.
29-07-2020T03:08:25,CrimsonQuill,"Good grief, that makes sense now"
29-07-2020T03:09:01,Dadrobit,"Haven't been pulled over in about a decade myself. But the last times, I got pulled over like 4 times in a month for different shit."
29-07-2020T03:09:11,Dadrobit,Never got a ticket though.
29-07-2020T03:09:47,Dadrobit,Speeding. Traveling under the speed limit. Suspected evasion of a police officer. Suspected DWI.
29-07-2020T03:10:09,TorqueEmUp,I've got 3 tickets total.
29-07-2020T03:10:13,Dadrobit,It was a BUNCH of bullshit
29-07-2020T03:10:29,Dadrobit,"2 total, both from a camera, never a cop."
29-07-2020T03:10:34,TorqueEmUp,"2 speeding, and one driving wrong way on one way street. (That last one was pretty bullshit.)"
29-07-2020T03:11:11,Dadrobit,"Oh, wait, 3. Last one was from a cop after I caused an accident."
29-07-2020T03:11:23,Dadrobit,Almost forgot about that. That sucked.
29-07-2020T03:11:43,Dadrobit,Improper left hand turn. I got T-boned.
29-07-2020T03:11:51,CrimsonQuill,T-boned?
29-07-2020T03:11:56,Dadrobit,And sued for a quarter of a million dollars lol
29-07-2020T03:12:12,CrimsonQuill,What is it with sueing over there?!
29-07-2020T03:12:26,TorqueEmUp,blame the lawyers
29-07-2020T03:12:29,Dadrobit,"Car struck mine in a perpendicular manner. Creating a ""T"" shape"
29-07-2020T03:12:38,CrimsonQuill,And 250'000 dollars? How could anyone be able to pay that? You could buy a house!
29-07-2020T03:12:46,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, nasty"
29-07-2020T03:12:50,CrimsonQuill,Big dents then
29-07-2020T03:13:17,Dadrobit,"She wanted 2 million because she broke her arms, lost her job, and the pain prevented her from enjoying life anymore."
29-07-2020T03:13:48,CrimsonQuill,Oh. That puts things more into perspective...
29-07-2020T03:14:13,TorqueEmUp,That last one is always a bit of bullshit
29-07-2020T03:14:27,Dadrobit,"Turns out she's already lost her job that morning, and she had posted pictures of herself on her Facebook going jet skiing and horseback riding all smiles."
29-07-2020T03:14:41,Dadrobit,AFTER she broke her arms
29-07-2020T03:14:51,CrimsonQuill,....Less forgivable.
29-07-2020T03:15:08,TorqueEmUp,"""Lionel Hutz Attorney at Law here is my card"""
29-07-2020T03:15:12,Dadrobit,"Yeah, and insurance covered the cost of the 250k"
29-07-2020T03:15:38,TorqueEmUp,Damn ambulance chasers
29-07-2020T03:15:41,Dadrobit,"Accideo forgiveness too, so I never saw a giant raise in costs."
29-07-2020T03:15:48,Dadrobit,Accident*
29-07-2020T03:16:01,CrimsonQuill,That would have been a lifesaver.
29-07-2020T03:16:12,CrimsonQuill,I've only been in one car accident.
29-07-2020T03:16:19,Dadrobit,"I mean, I get it. I caused the accident 100% and she did need surgery to put her arms back together."
29-07-2020T03:16:30,CrimsonQuill,"Our car hit an oil slick on the road. We tipped over on our side, and used the windscreen as a door."
29-07-2020T03:16:42,CrimsonQuill,"No one was hurt, thank heavens, but it was terrifying,"
29-07-2020T03:16:45,Dadrobit,I can still remember her screams of pain. She hit me hard.
29-07-2020T03:17:01,Dadrobit,I got off with just a bit of glass in my elbow
29-07-2020T03:17:10,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, I know what a broken arm feels like. lol"
29-07-2020T03:17:22,CrimsonQuill,"...Same here, it's agony..."
29-07-2020T03:17:29,Dadrobit,Same here lol
29-07-2020T03:17:34,CrimsonQuill,But at the end of the day it was an accident.
29-07-2020T03:17:36,TorqueEmUp,"broken one in like the 5th grade, and my wrist a couple times before that."
29-07-2020T03:17:52,CrimsonQuill,"Fell of bike, broke scaephoid bone in wrist."
29-07-2020T03:18:02,TorqueEmUp,Mine was a bike as well
29-07-2020T03:18:06,Dadrobit,I used to ride dirt bikes. Broken most everything one time or another lol
29-07-2020T03:18:34,SpazztasticKiwi,lesson: don‚Äôt learn to ride a bike
29-07-2020T03:18:40,Dadrobit,"Arm, wrist, fingers, ribs, ankle, leg, back..."
29-07-2020T03:18:58,TorqueEmUp,Just don't be stupid with a bike
29-07-2020T03:19:00,Dadrobit,I have sufficiently set up my body fr early arthritis
29-07-2020T03:19:01,TorqueEmUp,like I was
29-07-2020T03:19:09,Dadrobit,For*
29-07-2020T03:19:18,Dadrobit,NOW YOU TELL ME?!??
29-07-2020T03:20:04,SpazztasticKiwi,better late that never?
29-07-2020T03:20:12,CrimsonQuill,"I'm starting to have back pain...the sinks in the kitchen are not designed for tall people. And at 6'4'', it's quite unpleasent."
29-07-2020T03:20:15,Dadrobit,I guess...
29-07-2020T03:20:20,CrimsonQuill,"Unpleasant, sorry, incorrect spelling"
29-07-2020T03:20:43,SpazztasticKiwi,never learned bikes
29-07-2020T03:20:56,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, mine was when I was riding down a very steep grass hill in my best friend's grandma's back yard, was one of those bikes when back pedaling locks up the rear wheel, and it slid on the wet grass, and I went over the handlebars."
29-07-2020T03:20:57,SpazztasticKiwi,so I‚Äôm good
29-07-2020T03:21:04,Dadrobit,I used to deal with tall people problems. Then I stopped being tall!
29-07-2020T03:21:35,TorqueEmUp,"I still don't exactly remember how it broke, I just know I flipped over the front of the bike."
29-07-2020T03:22:05,Dadrobit,Yep. Also went over the handlebars. Problem was I was racing a CR500 at the time. Just a bit too fast.
29-07-2020T03:22:06,SpazztasticKiwi,did break my arm but I landed with all my weight on it at once so
29-07-2020T03:22:26,CrimsonQuill,"When we were on holiday once there was a door I kept banging my head against, and my smug little sister hopped right under it. We called it the 'Japanese Doorway' because of the joke of Japanese people being fairly short."
29-07-2020T03:22:44,Dadrobit,ThatsRacist.gif

29-07-2020T03:23:18,CrimsonQuill,We just found it funny that I kept banging my head
29-07-2020T03:23:35,CrimsonQuill,And...on tuesday my brother and I disturbed a wasp's nest.
29-07-2020T03:23:42,CrimsonQuill,A big one. Football sized.
29-07-2020T03:23:44,SpazztasticKiwi,keep it

29-07-2020T03:40:22,CrimsonQuill,The Rose Garden was terrifying.
29-07-2020T03:41:07,CrimsonQuill,"I knew something was very wrong in the manor, and with Trace's fractured Psyche, but this is GLaDOS levels of horrifying."
29-07-2020T03:41:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I doubt it was meant to head towards a kids birthday party
29-07-2020T03:42:02,CrimsonQuill,I wonder if Rose is screaming inside? How painful is it?
29-07-2020T03:42:17,CrimsonQuill,"How long has she hung there, in limbo between life and Death?"
29-07-2020T03:42:30,CrimsonQuill,And what the HELL is that Trace Doppleganger?
29-07-2020T03:42:44,SpazztasticKiwi,we‚Äôll find out eventually
29-07-2020T03:43:03,SpazztasticKiwi,comic ain‚Äôt done till there‚Äôs a the end
29-07-2020T03:43:06,CrimsonQuill,My guess is that he literally split a shard off of his soul.
29-07-2020T03:43:12,CrimsonQuill,But this is VERY well done.
29-07-2020T03:43:43,CrimsonQuill,"It reminds me of the elements of GLaDOS in Portal, or of the darkest parts of Project Freelancer in RvB"
29-07-2020T03:44:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not one to stay hyped on something for long

29-07-2020T03:44:53,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôll happen eventually
29-07-2020T03:45:04,CrimsonQuill,True that.
29-07-2020T03:45:16,SpazztasticKiwi,vibrating in place about it won‚Äôt move it faster

29-07-2020T13:26:36,CrRAR,Like robit said though apparently it was a lumber train

29-07-2020T13:33:22,CrRAR,I usually just browse iMBD for actors/directors and click through ‚Äúrelated‚Äù to find obsucre and interesting things I‚Äôve never seen.
29-07-2020T13:34:10,CrRAR,I especially like watching lots from a given director to see how their narritive style develops and see what things remain consistent

29-07-2020T13:44:12,CrRAR,To be honest though it may have been part of the plan because if they handled it ‚Äúresponsibly‚Äù there would have been no motivation for emergency stimulus
29-07-2020T13:44:33,CrRAR,With emergency stimulus there is bolstering of the economy

29-07-2020T13:45:40,CrRAR,"Like even if handling of it was responsiblly, the economy would still be impacted, but crazy stimulus might not have been possible/needed, but idk"

29-07-2020T15:23:09,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, we might be able to work with this"
29-07-2020T15:23:12,CrimsonQuill,"And I can't play DS3 tonight, as I do not have access to my Desktop. it is currently 80 kilometres north of me."
29-07-2020T15:23:22,AspiringNoodle,"Assuming I wake up at a reasonable hour, I could do some coop early in the morning"
29-07-2020T15:23:54,CrimsonQuill,I will likely be in my digs with my computer by about 12-1pm Greenwich Mean time
29-07-2020T15:24:07,AspiringNoodle,"If my butt gets up at 10 tomorrow, I'd be able to play with you around 3pm"
29-07-2020T15:24:52,CrimsonQuill,That might work out.
29-07-2020T15:24:57,CrimsonQuill,I will keep an eye out.
29-07-2020T15:25:07,CrimsonQuill,:) Expect much noobishness

29-07-2020T15:26:59,CrimsonQuill,"That being said, after Halo 2 legendary, how hard can it be?"
29-07-2020T15:27:08,AspiringNoodle,"nvm, it work"
29-07-2020T15:29:26,CrimsonQuill,Weeelll...I may need to leave...
29-07-2020T15:29:30,CrimsonQuill,As much as I want to stay
29-07-2020T15:29:37,CrimsonQuill,I have to leave the house at 9am tomorrow
29-07-2020T15:29:43,CrimsonQuill,And need to be packed tonight.
29-07-2020T15:29:49,CrimsonQuill,"Then again, I could lurk."
29-07-2020T15:29:54,CrimsonQuill,"Yeah. Imma gonna lurk,"
29-07-2020T15:29:57,CrimsonQuill,lurks
29-07-2020T15:35:24,SpazztasticKiwi,if I wanted to give my tub a new look could I coat it with flexseal
29-07-2020T15:36:38,AspiringNoodle,Dunno how comfy it would be
29-07-2020T15:36:53,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, if you want to paint something *and* have it be indestructible, use bedlinder, lol"
29-07-2020T15:37:01,AspiringNoodle,bedliner*
29-07-2020T15:37:03,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs off white
29-07-2020T15:37:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I wanted to make it white
29-07-2020T15:37:18,SpazztasticKiwi,off white makes it look dirty
29-07-2020T15:38:00,AspiringNoodle,I know exactly what you're talking about
29-07-2020T15:38:13,AspiringNoodle,It's part of the reason I didn't make my PC white after much deliberation
29-07-2020T15:38:25,AspiringNoodle,Hmmm...
29-07-2020T15:39:02,AspiringNoodle,"Will you be able to make the coating smooth, or will the product have inherent bumpiness after application?"
29-07-2020T15:40:17,SpazztasticKiwi,if I used the paint formula I could theoretically get it to be rather smooth if think
29-07-2020T15:41:00,AspiringNoodle,Hmmmm
29-07-2020T15:41:11,AspiringNoodle,I'd say test it on some random scrap lying around
29-07-2020T15:41:17,AspiringNoodle,"Like a piece of wood, a spare tile, etc"
29-07-2020T15:41:25,AspiringNoodle,See how it feels / looks first
29-07-2020T15:41:33,AspiringNoodle,"And if all is good, move on from there"
29-07-2020T15:43:05,SpazztasticKiwi,the spray may be quicker and make it even
29-07-2020T15:43:20,SpazztasticKiwi,the biggest problem is my bathroom doesn‚Äôt have a window
29-07-2020T15:44:24,AspiringNoodle,The only way around that would be a heavy-duty protective mask

29-07-2020T15:56:51,AspiringNoodle,"While some game engines are super nice, those royalty fees can bite you in the but if you're just starting out as a game dev and want to make it a career :/"

29-07-2020T15:58:48,AspiringNoodle,Things like Unity and Unreal can have different business models
29-07-2020T15:59:01,AspiringNoodle,"Like, maybe you pay a % of any profits you make from your game"
29-07-2020T15:59:17,AspiringNoodle,Or you pay a set $$ amount for any games you publish that use the engine
29-07-2020T15:59:20,anraiki,Oh yea.
29-07-2020T15:59:34,anraiki,Unreal is really attractive for independent game developers

29-07-2020T18:05:55,BluePhantom90,lets just say Patreon is fucked
29-07-2020T18:05:59,CrimsonHelsing,More her painted in someone else's style than his own. And I don't blame him
29-07-2020T18:06:08,PierrotPuppetry,and i think OnlyFans too. i think in terms of service it says they 'own everyone's pics' and can redistribute as they wish
29-07-2020T18:06:38,PierrotPuppetry,"dA also has a similar policy, saying they 'own' all artwork posted"
29-07-2020T18:06:48,CrRAR,Saria does have her Lion form ord
