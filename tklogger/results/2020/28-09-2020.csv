28-09-2020T00:36:16,AspiringNoodle,Hopes & Dreams by Toby Fox is one of my all-time favorites.  It's just so emotional.
28-09-2020T00:36:22,Dadrobit,"Looking through the Epic Mountain site, they strive for about a minutes worth of content a day, so doable by one talented guy, or a good small team pretty easy."

28-09-2020T00:50:44,Dadrobit,"Mmhmm, surgery is no fun. Even just signing the ""you might die, your family can't sue us"" paperwork before anything even happens is nerve-wracking."
28-09-2020T00:51:22,CrRAR,yeah
28-09-2020T00:52:15,Dadrobit,I've been procrastinating getting an endoscopy myself cuz even non surgical procedures scare the shit outta me.
28-09-2020T00:53:12,CrRAR,I guess you just have to think that you're really just one in a long line of patients
28-09-2020T00:53:24,CrRAR,It is freaky tho
28-09-2020T00:53:45,Dadrobit,Also money. Shits expensive.
28-09-2020T00:53:54,CrRAR,indeed
28-09-2020T00:54:29,Dadrobit,Legit part of the reason I put everything off for so long was because I had hope Bernie would get in and it wouldn't be so bad...

28-09-2020T01:10:15,unsteddyphoenix,Shit can remember the title
28-09-2020T01:10:18,unsteddyphoenix,*cant
28-09-2020T01:10:20,AspiringNoodle,Princess Mononoke?  My Neighbor Totoro?
28-09-2020T01:10:21,qwe304,@BadFoMo i went ahead and edited it myself lol
28-09-2020T01:10:35,TobyTTobes,They really were!
28-09-2020T01:10:35,BadFoMo,Do what now?
28-09-2020T01:10:41,qwe304,walpaper
28-09-2020T01:10:45,Twokinds,We watched... Laputa: Castle in the Sky
28-09-2020T01:10:46,AspiringNoodle,The Secret World of Arrietty?
28-09-2020T01:10:49,AspiringNoodle,:O
28-09-2020T01:10:54,AspiringNoodle,Das a good one!
28-09-2020T01:10:58,Dadrobit,Oh! Never saw that one.
28-09-2020T01:11:05,RimaDraws,i love studio ghibli movies
28-09-2020T01:11:07,Twokinds,I'd never seen it but it was nice to look at. Made me want to research Ghibli art.
28-09-2020T01:11:10,steelabjur,"Oh, that one is pretty good!"
28-09-2020T01:11:18,Twokinds,Lotta clouds
28-09-2020T01:11:30,InTheLionsDen,Laputa is one of my favorites. I like the airships.
28-09-2020T01:11:34,Dadrobit,Now I wanna see what you would do after watching something by Satoshi Kon.
28-09-2020T01:11:41,TheSexyBeast,*adds movi to the list*
28-09-2020T01:11:44,AspiringNoodle,"Princess Mononoke has a lot of violence in it, but there is just so many nature scenes"
28-09-2020T01:12:06,Dadrobit,Natani in Perfect Blue would be fucking incredible with the themes on identity.
28-09-2020T01:12:36,Twokinds,Mononoke is one I've seen several times. It's one of the ones I owned growing up.
28-09-2020T01:12:47,AspiringNoodle,:D
28-09-2020T01:12:49,Dadrobit,RIP Satoshi Kon.
28-09-2020T01:12:50,Twokinds,Totoro was my first anime. But It's been so long I barely remember it.
28-09-2020T01:12:50,RimaDraws,i didnt seen mononoke till two years ago
28-09-2020T01:13:07,AspiringNoodle,I've... seen every Ghibli film :ptv-uneasy:
28-09-2020T01:13:13,RimaDraws,dont brag
28-09-2020T01:13:19,Dadrobit,Totoro was one of my earliest. Nausicca was my first.
28-09-2020T01:13:25,AspiringNoodle,They're just so good :ptv-whiny:
28-09-2020T01:13:30,RimaDraws,my first one was spirited away
28-09-2020T01:13:47,AspiringNoodle,I honestly can't remember my first one.  It was either that or Kiki's Delivery Service.
28-09-2020T01:13:50,CrRAR,In at the deep end~
28-09-2020T01:13:59,CrRAR,me too Rima haha
28-09-2020T01:13:59,TheSexyBeast,I need to watch them all again
28-09-2020T01:14:15,AspiringNoodle,A lot of the talent from Ghibli started a new studio
28-09-2020T01:14:24,AspiringNoodle,I saw their first film: Mary and the Witch's Flower
28-09-2020T01:14:24,Dadrobit,"Why Nausicca was in the ""young children"" section of Blockbuster, the world may never know"
28-09-2020T01:14:31,TobyTTobes,I've just seen Spirted Away for the first time yesterday. I was very fun
28-09-2020T01:14:45,RimaDraws,i haven't seen them all. but i have seen some
28-09-2020T01:14:54,CrRAR,Yeah pretty mature concepts
28-09-2020T01:15:08,CrRAR,Nausicca is wicked good
28-09-2020T01:15:17,RimaDraws,"aside from studio ghibli movies, wolf children was good"
28-09-2020T01:15:35,AspiringNoodle,I cried so hard watching that one :ptv-whiny:
28-09-2020T01:15:46,Dadrobit,(I really didn't like Wolf Children myself)
28-09-2020T01:15:54,RimaDraws,booooo
28-09-2020T01:16:06,AspiringNoodle,"Rima, we must correct this... imbalance in the universe"
28-09-2020T01:16:34,Dadrobit,shrugs
28-09-2020T01:16:47,Dadrobit,It really just wasn't my cup o joe.
28-09-2020T01:16:54,RimaDraws,that movie was so good how could you not like it
28-09-2020T01:16:56,unsteddyphoenix,what kinda furry are ya
28-09-2020T01:17:12,AspiringNoodle,The kind that doesn't know good art when it whacks him on the head
28-09-2020T01:17:14,AspiringNoodle,That's what kind
28-09-2020T01:17:25,Dadrobit,I'm not? This seems to still be a point of consternation for y'all.
28-09-2020T01:17:35,AspiringNoodle,*angry noodle noises*
28-09-2020T01:17:45,RimaDraws,a point of what
28-09-2020T01:17:52,unsteddyphoenix,Thats just what a furry would say
28-09-2020T01:18:06,CrRAR,"I'm in the robit boat on that one, though it wasn't terrible I thought it was okay."
28-09-2020T01:18:17,Dadrobit,"I thought furries said, ""owo uwu what's this yiff yiff yiff?"""
28-09-2020T01:18:39,RimaDraws,i'm a furry and i don't say those
28-09-2020T01:18:40,unsteddyphoenix,hmm they do say that a lot. touche.
28-09-2020T01:18:48,CrRAR,It was just like... too real worldy in it's subject matter I guess.
28-09-2020T01:18:48,AspiringNoodle,@n@
28-09-2020T01:19:09,AspiringNoodle,^ (the saddest face possible)
28-09-2020T01:19:47,CrRAR,:cw0lfmare-EmberSad:
28-09-2020T01:19:54,AspiringNoodle,See?
28-09-2020T01:20:06,qwe304,"heres the playlist I threw together for tom, what do yall think? https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV6MfsOY8w7t4F077yYrK6vj7IiBRjBDq"
28-09-2020T01:20:33,Dadrobit,"Clunky story flow, SUPER budget animation, disagreeable ending. Just wasn't that good imo."
28-09-2020T01:21:00,RimaDraws,hm
28-09-2020T01:21:08,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-nibrun::ctwokinds-nibrun:
28-09-2020T01:21:12,CrRAR,Okay I must drive home from this crazy long shift.
28-09-2020T01:21:20,AspiringNoodle,"Dadro, Wolf Children, right?"
28-09-2020T01:21:26,CrRAR,Buhbye for now ppl
28-09-2020T01:21:31,RimaDraws,i just got home two hours ago CrRAR

28-09-2020T01:21:43,Dadrobit,o/ RAR
28-09-2020T01:21:45,CrRAR,will do
28-09-2020T01:21:45,unsteddyphoenix,good luck cr
28-09-2020T01:21:47,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, what about the ending did you not like?  Because I may actually be in the same boat, haha"
28-09-2020T01:21:50,unsteddyphoenix,thoughts and prayers
28-09-2020T01:21:51,CrRAR,Haha
28-09-2020T01:21:52,AspiringNoodle,Also night rarararar

28-09-2020T01:22:47,CrRAR,oo a baby moth
28-09-2020T01:22:55,CrRAR,Gotta close date window
28-09-2020T01:23:04,CrRAR,*dat
28-09-2020T01:23:15,RimaDraws,good save
28-09-2020T01:23:32,Dadrobit,"I don't remember exactly what happened, but I remember that the way the characters were set up pretty much the whole movie did a hard 180 at the very end and it felt super forced."
28-09-2020T01:24:13,AspiringNoodle,I actually know what you mean
28-09-2020T01:24:30,AspiringNoodle,"As children, the daughter was the adventurous one embracing her gift, the son not so much."
28-09-2020T01:24:42,AspiringNoodle,"Childhood accident, yada yada yada, personality flip years later."
28-09-2020T01:25:05,Dadrobit,I was purposefully being vague to avoid chat spoilers my dude.
28-09-2020T01:25:16,AspiringNoodle,myb
28-09-2020T01:25:20,Dadrobit,Lol
28-09-2020T01:26:11,steelabjur,"G'night guys, think I'll head down the old dusty virtual road. See ya later!"
28-09-2020T01:26:17,AspiringNoodle,Night steel
28-09-2020T01:26:32,Dadrobit,o/ steele
28-09-2020T01:26:34,AspiringNoodle,And I kinda have to agree.  The story was overall enjoyable
28-09-2020T01:26:35,RimaDraws,i need a blanket
28-09-2020T01:26:49,AspiringNoodle,But the role reversal towards the end still has me scratching my head a bit.
28-09-2020T01:27:12,AspiringNoodle,"Especially since, logically, certain events would like reinforce one perspective and maybe weaken the other"
28-09-2020T01:28:16,Dadrobit,":/ even before that the story was ""meh"" for me. The only thing keeping me awake was how jarringly bad the animation was at times and how much they reused animation throughout."
28-09-2020T01:28:54,AspiringNoodle,Hmmm... I wonder if Wolf Children is available on Hulu
28-09-2020T01:29:13,AspiringNoodle,"Don't wanna sub directly to funimation, haha.  They're becoming the new 4kids"
28-09-2020T01:29:15,Dadrobit,"To be fair, I had just gotten done watching Hibike Euphonium by Kyoto Animation right before."
28-09-2020T01:29:40,Dadrobit,Everything else looks worse in comparison.
28-09-2020T01:30:08,AspiringNoodle,I believe that one is in my backlog
28-09-2020T01:30:40,Dadrobit,But even apart from that I don't think it looked particularly good. Especially not in comparison to the box art. Almost feels like false advertising.
28-09-2020T01:31:44,AspiringNoodle,"I've got some good anime in my backlog, got any particular interests? xD"
28-09-2020T01:32:02,AspiringNoodle,Because one has a pretty funny joke setup at the beginning
28-09-2020T01:32:08,Dadrobit,HE is super good. Probably in no small part my opinion is inflated from being a Euphonium player myself. But still.
28-09-2020T01:33:08,AspiringNoodle,How into action / adventure / fantasy are you?
28-09-2020T01:34:24,Dadrobit,"Eh, I'm all about the story. Any genre is fine as long as it is super well told, or funny."
28-09-2020T01:35:24,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, you might appreciate this then"
28-09-2020T01:35:44,Dadrobit,"I only get around to two or three shows a year, I got too much shit to do to blow time on crap."
28-09-2020T01:36:10,AspiringNoodle,"""Didn't I Say to Make My Abilities Average in the Next Life?!"
28-09-2020T01:36:27,Dadrobit,That's a hard no
28-09-2020T01:36:34,AspiringNoodle,Awww
28-09-2020T01:36:41,AspiringNoodle,"It's got such a good starting joke, too"
28-09-2020T01:37:11,AspiringNoodle,"Prodigal high schooler finally graduates, unfortunate death, meets literal God"
28-09-2020T01:37:36,AspiringNoodle,"Asks to make their abilities average when they're reborn, God does politician math"
28-09-2020T01:38:14,AspiringNoodle,"So, things like Elder Dragons were taken into account with this request, lmao."
28-09-2020T01:38:50,AspiringNoodle,Did you ever watch One Punch Man?
28-09-2020T01:39:33,Dadrobit,I do not believe the English language contains the required words to describe the level of disinterest I have in watching an anime about isekai in-jokes with an OP protagonist.
28-09-2020T01:40:10,Dadrobit,"I already watched two anime + a  rewatch, so my quota is already pretty full up."
28-09-2020T01:40:31,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-renirar:
28-09-2020T01:41:29,AspiringNoodle,"Well, what about Ascendance of a Bookworm?"
28-09-2020T01:41:38,AspiringNoodle,I can't remember if Sage ever mentioned this one or not
28-09-2020T01:42:12,Dadrobit,BNA 6/10. The Great Pretender 6.5/10. Violet Evergarden 9.5/10.
28-09-2020T01:42:48,Dadrobit,"Yeah, Sage has mentioned it a couple times. Couldn't get into it."
28-09-2020T01:44:56,AspiringNoodle,Deca-Dence?
28-09-2020T01:46:47,Dadrobit,The only decadence I am looking forward to is the newest season of The Great British Bake Off.
28-09-2020T01:47:19,Dadrobit,Great British Baking Show*
28-09-2020T01:47:40,AspiringNoodle,I'd recommend looking into it.  It's a rather interesting story
28-09-2020T01:48:03,SpazztasticKiwi,does anybody here know who brewstew is
28-09-2020T01:48:22,AspiringNoodle,"Also has built-in commentary on things like the relationship between workers and employers, and the pacification of the working class"
28-09-2020T01:48:31,AspiringNoodle,As well as being HORRENDOUSLY dystopian.
28-09-2020T01:49:06,AspiringNoodle,"But it presents itself as anything but.  A lot of the art direction is bright, colorful, and happy.  Big contrast to what's actually going on."
28-09-2020T01:49:41,Dadrobit,So... Twokinds?
28-09-2020T01:49:51,AspiringNoodle,Just... give it a shot xD
28-09-2020T01:50:06,AspiringNoodle,"Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to watch some SAO abridged"
28-09-2020T01:50:20,AspiringNoodle,A parody that is infinitely more entertaining / well written compared to the original :ptv-snicker:
28-09-2020T01:54:09,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, and before I forgot:  If that doesn't suit your fancy.  Made in Abyss is always a good choice."
28-09-2020T01:54:26,AspiringNoodle,...assuming you haven't watched / re-watched it yet
28-09-2020T02:13:17,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s officially sneaky snuggles season
28-09-2020T02:24:17,SpazztasticKiwi,🛌
28-09-2020T02:45:04,Twokinds,I just remembered I have to make tiger trace

28-09-2020T03:08:56,CrimsonQuill,I've told myself to take a short walk every morning and at Lunch too...sitting in front of a PC all day is tiring.

28-09-2020T16:38:29,Twokinds,i dunno
28-09-2020T16:39:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"I was just wondering if you were trying out a new schedule - every other Friday, comic page or random side/filler doodles"
28-09-2020T16:40:20,SpazztasticKiwi,like to help if you were stuck on a page idea
28-09-2020T16:46:27,Twokinds,I have no clue what I'm doing at any given time
28-09-2020T16:47:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I believe it
28-09-2020T16:47:33,SpazztasticKiwi,but sometimes one can be fooled that you have a plan
28-09-2020T16:48:33,SpazztasticKiwi,or a theory
28-09-2020T16:49:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark really did learn alot from you like he says huh

28-09-2020T17:10:37,SpazztasticKiwi,sometimes I imagine that face saying “wobbuffet”
28-09-2020T17:11:13,SpazztasticKiwi,or “wak”....or “wa(h)”
28-09-2020T17:13:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"anyway, the person that made “if you give a mouse a cookie” should’ve made another book “if you give a cat some chicken”"
28-09-2020T17:30:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"to be clear, there wouldn’t be much to it, only a page that says “he drops it & wont find it until you pick it back up for him like you’re feeding a horse”"
28-09-2020T18:03:57,SpazztasticKiwi,🦉
28-09-2020T18:05:42,SpazztasticKiwi,is it true that vulcan names have only 5 letter beginning with s and ending with k?
28-09-2020T18:14:59,Ordithus,:vulcan: i dunno
28-09-2020T18:15:35,CrRAR,That doesn’t seem sustainable for a whole planet of people

28-09-2020T18:16:13,CrRAR,"Oh wait, all of Vulkan was destroyed so there aren’t that many anyway"
28-09-2020T18:16:24,CrRAR,:ptv-whiny:
28-09-2020T18:17:05,CrRAR,Maybe they specifically saved all the 5 letter named people for some reason
28-09-2020T18:18:18,CrRAR,...or... maybe they boarded ships orderly/alphabetically somehow (cuz their smartness) and only the ship with 5-letter s/k names survived.
28-09-2020T18:18:39,CrRAR,I’m gonna have to read the wiki now on all this
28-09-2020T18:18:44,SpazztasticKiwi,does that mean shrek is a vulcan name
28-09-2020T18:19:08,CrRAR,The truth REVEALED

28-09-2020T18:26:13,CrRAR,True they are quite enterprising in the worst way

28-09-2020T19:51:06,SpazztasticKiwi,went from a songbird to the starship enterprise https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WA0tP-p7m40
28-09-2020T19:51:25,CrRAR,lol it looks like what I would imagine a miniature malnourished peacock would look like ;_;
28-09-2020T19:51:38,SpazztasticKiwi,“target sighted” starts shooting lasers at you
28-09-2020T19:53:34,CrRAR,That’s pretty wild
28-09-2020T19:54:26,CrRAR,I wonder if they compete for the most unique mimic or something
28-09-2020T19:55:01,CrRAR,Like how would other birds judge “good” sounds if they could be from anywhere
28-09-2020T19:55:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"car alarms, camera shutters & motors & even chainsaws"
28-09-2020T19:55:53,CrRAR,It’d be like going to a sporting event and every player was doing a different sport
28-09-2020T19:55:58,SpazztasticKiwi,the goal is to make the most unique song ever
28-09-2020T19:56:05,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s how they court
28-09-2020T19:56:31,CrRAR,Chicks that are into chainsaws?
28-09-2020T19:56:38,CrRAR,Now that’s metal
28-09-2020T19:56:47,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s like if a guy came up to me and started listing of the most complicated words in the dictionary to music even if it didn’t make sense
28-09-2020T19:56:54,SpazztasticKiwi,still better than a dick pic
28-09-2020T19:57:07,CrRAR,truuuu dat

28-09-2020T19:59:15,SpazztasticKiwi,you’d have to be Very Careful what you say or do around this bird
28-09-2020T19:59:54,SpazztasticKiwi,the first person to hear a parrot talk was probably not ok for several days
28-09-2020T20:00:08,SpazztasticKiwi,what about the first person to hear one of these things
28-09-2020T20:00:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Dora dont wanna explora no mora
28-09-2020T20:01:16,CrRAR,Oo they are bigger than I thought - looks football sized
28-09-2020T20:01:35,CrRAR,and they have REALLY dark pupils
28-09-2020T20:01:42,CrRAR,Not just blackness
28-09-2020T20:02:53,SpazztasticKiwi,they weren’t made colorful so they had to get creative
28-09-2020T20:03:22,CrRAR,"God: “eh, it’s a bird”"
28-09-2020T20:03:37,CrRAR,"“Ooo, look! An extra quail feather”"
28-09-2020T20:03:59,CrRAR,*places on butt-end*
28-09-2020T20:04:04,CrRAR,“Perfect!”
28-09-2020T20:04:50,CrRAR,"...maybe I’m thinking pheasant, pheasant feather"
28-09-2020T20:05:05,CrRAR,Quail too tiny
28-09-2020T20:05:27,CrRAR,It is weird how some animals’ eyelids obscure their scelera
28-09-2020T20:06:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’ve never seen a quail in person that I know of but forget quail, look up button quail"
28-09-2020T20:06:13,CrRAR,I suppose for safety though... you wouldn’t want more squishyness exposed than you need
28-09-2020T20:06:39,CrRAR,Yeah their head feather is like a little doodle
28-09-2020T20:14:56,Ordithus,button quails are adorable <3

28-09-2020T23:42:01,CrRAR,"I'm used to the baps by now, that's why I have live in this box."
28-09-2020T23:46:22,Dadrobit,"In happier news, The Great British Baking Show is back and it seems they managed to find a full cast of bakers where there are no obvious outliers right out of the gate!"

28-09-2020T23:47:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve seen what the baking shows about
28-09-2020T23:47:30,Dadrobit,Usually though they tend to have two or three obviously bad bakers that get kicked off first.
28-09-2020T23:47:35,SpazztasticKiwi,it cool
28-09-2020T23:47:45,CrRAR,What was their first challenge?
28-09-2020T23:47:49,Dadrobit,This time everyone seems to be on fairly even ground.
28-09-2020T23:47:58,Dadrobit,The first week was cake week.
28-09-2020T23:48:24,CrRAR,Did any involve strawberries?
28-09-2020T23:50:27,Dadrobit,"Challenge one was a two toned and complimentary flavored cake, challenge two was 6 identical pineapple upside down cakes, challenge three was to sculpt a bust of someone famous out of cake"
28-09-2020T23:51:05,CrRAR,Pineapple can be good too w/ whipped cream
28-09-2020T23:51:23,Dadrobit,There was a bunch of tension/drama with the second challenge because one contestant accidentally knocked another's tray wrecking their cakes.
28-09-2020T23:51:43,Dadrobit,"Yeah, they had shipped cream and a cherry on top."
28-09-2020T23:51:43,CrRAR,Any particular standouts for the cake-busts?
28-09-2020T23:52:13,CrRAR,"Somehow, Elon would strike me as a figure for a cake these days."
28-09-2020T23:52:25,Dadrobit,The queen of England was a pretty good one. Another did Queen as in Freddie Mercury and it was hilarious.
28-09-2020T23:52:41,CrRAR,Oh nice
28-09-2020T23:53:04,Dadrobit,It's on Netflix and it's absolutely worth everyone's time.
28-09-2020T23:53:05,CrRAR,Like with a wicked handle bar mustache and whatever?
28-09-2020T23:53:33,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it was very... Stylized I'd say."
28-09-2020T23:53:56,Dadrobit,Impressionistic perhaps.
28-09-2020T23:54:23,Dadrobit,David Bowie was another and it was a minor disaster.
28-09-2020T23:55:54,SpazztasticKiwi,shipped cream
