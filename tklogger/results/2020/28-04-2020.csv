28-04-2020T16:53:11,AspiringNoodle,I remember when a banana taped to the wall was considered fine art
28-04-2020T16:53:22,AspiringNoodle,#WhyFineArtIsAnUtterJoke
28-04-2020T16:54:06,AspiringNoodle,"That reminds me, I can't remember which art 'tuber made a video on it, but they broke up art school students into separate camps"
28-04-2020T16:55:13,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s a beautiful banner
28-04-2020T16:55:24,SpazztasticKiwi,that person deserves a tip
28-04-2020T16:55:26,SpazztasticKiwi,such art
28-04-2020T16:56:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Natibbly looking like “what.....what am I?”
28-04-2020T16:57:06,AspiringNoodle,"Bah, can't find it.  But I can remember three different artists they mentioned, and maybe that's all of them!"
28-04-2020T16:57:24,AspiringNoodle,"Fine art, crafts, and design."
28-04-2020T16:57:40,AspiringNoodle,"Crafts, the super chill ones who wanted to make stuff that people could actually use"
28-04-2020T16:58:09,AspiringNoodle,"Design, typically people who loved anime growing up, but they're the ones who want to make what's deemed ""commercial art"", aka what Tom makes"
28-04-2020T16:58:36,AspiringNoodle,And then Fine Arts.  Aka the a-holes.
28-04-2020T16:59:07,AspiringNoodle,"Plenty of chill FA students, but if you ever had the stuck-up, snobby, elitist, they were guaranteed to be in this camp :P"
28-04-2020T16:59:35,AspiringNoodle,"Anyone got a favorite example of ""fine art"" they want us to mock?"
28-04-2020T16:59:44,CrimsonQuill,Umm
28-04-2020T16:59:45,CrimsonQuill,No
28-04-2020T16:59:56,CrimsonQuill,All I can give is a 'fine art' that I love
28-04-2020T16:59:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I graduated in fine arts

28-04-2020T17:00:32,CrimsonQuill,Rembrandt is my favourite painter.
28-04-2020T17:00:43,CrimsonQuill,His art is...heavenly.
28-04-2020T17:01:09,AspiringNoodle,That's acceptable too!
28-04-2020T17:01:28,AspiringNoodle,"I'm more talking about the pieces of ""fine art"" that make you go ""really, this is considered 'art'???"""
28-04-2020T17:02:07,CrimsonQuill,Like splashes of paint sold for $10'000?
28-04-2020T17:02:10,AspiringNoodle,"You know, the one's that are worth a lot of money *cough cough BANANA TAPED TO WALL cough cough* but really shouldn't be."
28-04-2020T17:02:45,CrimsonQuill,"Reminds me of the character from ""Untouchable"" mocking a similar piece of 'art', and them making a similar one to see if he can cash in..."
28-04-2020T17:02:53,SpazztasticKiwi,the fine art class is a group of the rich keeping it in the circle

28-04-2020T17:03:42,CrimsonQuill,"Someone take me off the boiling plate, I feel a rant coming on."
28-04-2020T17:03:46,CrimsonQuill,Seriously.
28-04-2020T17:03:47,AspiringNoodle,"^^^ Adam Ruins Everything had a wonderful episode breaking down how the Fine Art world is a giant scam, lol"
28-04-2020T17:03:54,CrimsonQuill,I am feeling ABSOLUTELY LIVID at the moment.

28-04-2020T17:03:57,CrimsonQuill,COME.
28-04-2020T17:03:59,CrimsonQuill,THE HECK.
28-04-2020T17:04:01,CrimsonQuill,ON.
28-04-2020T17:04:06,CrimsonQuill,A banana taped to the wall...
28-04-2020T17:04:15,CrimsonQuill,Sold for 120'000 dollars?
28-04-2020T17:04:25,CrimsonQuill,"I mean, at least you can eat it after, but COME ON!"
28-04-2020T17:04:26,AspiringNoodle,"There is literally no objective measure of quality, you could be the greatest artist since Picasso, and unless you have the right connections in the gallery circuit, your art ain't worth squat."
28-04-2020T17:04:41,CrimsonQuill,"f@!:""@ The gallery circuit!"
28-04-2020T17:04:43,CrRAR,"Yeah, it’s subjective with a dollar value attached for the privilege of being able to “experience” it."
28-04-2020T17:04:46,AspiringNoodle,And I'm fairly certain it's not the banana itself
28-04-2020T17:04:51,CrimsonQuill,Pah!
28-04-2020T17:04:54,AspiringNoodle,It's the concept of the banana duct-taped to the wall
28-04-2020T17:05:01,CrimsonQuill,The national Gallery here at least has actual art!
28-04-2020T17:05:06,AspiringNoodle,"Because iirc they had to replace the banana several times, even before the ""incident"""
28-04-2020T17:05:15,AspiringNoodle,I wanna go back to the gallery :c
28-04-2020T17:05:28,CrimsonQuill,My aunt and I went to what ended up being a depressing and kind of stupid 'Art' exhibition when she took me to Venice

28-04-2020T17:06:52,CrimsonQuill,That sculptor is amazing.
28-04-2020T17:07:32,CrimsonQuill,"I always love these, because they're able to see the folds, and make them out of stone...."
28-04-2020T17:07:40,CrimsonQuill,Imma gonna chip in here
28-04-2020T17:07:51,AspiringNoodle,There's actually a group of artists trying to restore an objective standard to art ala the Renaissance
28-04-2020T17:07:52,CrimsonQuill,Any of you guys heard of the 'Soldier made from Scrap?'
28-04-2020T17:08:24,AspiringNoodle,Now THAT is impressive
28-04-2020T17:08:38,CrimsonQuill,A man from Dorset used Bicycle and car and machine parts to make a statue of a WW1 soldier in memory of those who died for the Centenary.

28-04-2020T17:12:00,CrimsonQuill,"@AspiringNoodle too true...but what can we little people do at the moment, with the big boots on top?"

28-04-2020T17:13:16,AspiringNoodle,"And by that, they will ""donate"" a piece from their gallery to a museum that they ""estimate"" a worth for, then get to use that as a tax writeoff."
28-04-2020T17:13:21,CrimsonQuill,I could find something better on a dog's arse than some of the stuff they have.
28-04-2020T17:14:25,AspiringNoodle,"Now, fine art is still great.  It's just that we have this BS tarnishing it"
28-04-2020T17:14:38,CrimsonQuill,It's like anything isn't it?
28-04-2020T17:14:45,CrimsonQuill,You do have some good things
28-04-2020T17:14:50,CrimsonQuill,Maybe a lot of the good things

28-04-2020T17:15:41,CrimsonQuill,I like things like that
28-04-2020T17:15:43,AspiringNoodle,"A bit abstract, lots of meaning, excellent quality work"
28-04-2020T17:15:52,JojoGD,thats pretty cool
28-04-2020T17:15:53,AspiringNoodle,Not something stupid that takes like 5 seconds of execution

28-04-2020T17:16:35,AspiringNoodle,"But as it stands, I wouldn't want to be a fine artist."
28-04-2020T17:16:54,AspiringNoodle,"They don't really care about your work, they care more about your connections."
28-04-2020T17:17:01,CrimsonQuill,Me neither...I can't even make bog standard art yet.
28-04-2020T17:17:22,AspiringNoodle,"A mediocre artist who attends all sorts of gatherings and events, and makes connections with all the top people in the circuit will actually get their work featured"
28-04-2020T17:17:37,CrimsonQuill,It's painful though.
28-04-2020T17:17:44,AspiringNoodle,Whereas the savant artist who attends seldomly will never get their work featured
28-04-2020T17:17:54,CrimsonQuill,The people who put their hearts and souls into their work are forgotten...always.
28-04-2020T17:18:18,JojoGD,man thats sad
28-04-2020T17:18:47,CrimsonQuill,"Even when it's something remarkable and beautiful, they're shovelled to the backseat for the 'oh-so-brilliant' paint-splasher or businessperson."
28-04-2020T17:19:09,CrimsonQuill,And I'm probably part of the damn bloody system without even realizing it...
28-04-2020T17:19:12,AspiringNoodle,"Pollock is a good example of ""nonsense"" art that is actually good xD"

28-04-2020T17:21:28,AspiringNoodle,It reminds me of a painting mentioned in the Archer series (not sure if it's real or not)
28-04-2020T17:22:26,AspiringNoodle,The work in question was an extremely beautiful piece that was excellently rendered.  But then ultimately buried under layer after layer of white paint.
28-04-2020T17:22:41,AspiringNoodle,So much so that the original piece will never be viewed.
28-04-2020T17:22:53,CrimsonQuill,That's...depressing...

28-04-2020T17:35:55,CrimsonQuill,The Irish famine of 1845-50 is a very black mark on the country's history.
28-04-2020T17:36:11,CrimsonQuill,Most of the country relied on potatoes for food. Then the blight hit.
28-04-2020T17:36:18,JojoGD,i haven't found my shiny cyndaquill yet
28-04-2020T17:36:21,CrimsonQuill,Ireland's population then was 8 million.
28-04-2020T17:36:35,CrimsonQuill,"By the end of the famine, it had dropped to 4 million."
28-04-2020T17:36:45,CrimsonQuill,"Or was it 6 million, dropping to 3 million?"
28-04-2020T17:37:02,AspiringNoodle,It's a prime example of how relying on a single food source can backfire horribly
28-04-2020T17:37:13,CrimsonQuill,It fell due to people dying of starvation (which the statues depict) or desperate emigration through 'coffin ships'

28-04-2020T17:38:37,CrimsonQuill,The famine is one of the reasons why the United States and Canda have so many people of Irish ancestry.
