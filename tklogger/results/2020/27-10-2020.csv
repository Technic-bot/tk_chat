27-10-2020T00:22:31,AspiringNoodle,Man... going through the main questlines of WoW and treating it like a single player game...
27-10-2020T00:22:41,AspiringNoodle,I can easily play for 2 hours and have enough for a day or two
27-10-2020T00:22:51,AspiringNoodle,But once I get to the endgame stuff... can just do it for hours on end.
27-10-2020T00:30:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark covering himself in chocolate is one of the many things thats come out of unus annus that I couldâ€™ve lived my whole life without
27-10-2020T00:31:20,AspiringNoodle,"I think at this point I'm just committed to avoiding that channel, haha"
27-10-2020T00:42:21,NinoGD,Iâ€™m about to fight the moon lord for the first time in terraria
27-10-2020T00:44:25,AspiringNoodle,"Omgosh, Kame and friends got their butts handed to them a lot by that guy xD"
27-10-2020T00:47:48,NinoGD,Yay I first timed it solo

27-10-2020T08:16:46,Dadrobit,One of my residents where I work has permanently put me off from buying a Tesla.
27-10-2020T08:17:01,CrimsonQuill,Enlighten us.
27-10-2020T08:17:49,Dadrobit,"Guy's brakes were going bad and I told him so, ""Yeah, Dadrobit, I know, I'm letting em all go bad before I take it in. They charge $2,000 for a brake job so I'm getting the most out of em."""
27-10-2020T08:18:08,CrimsonQuill,....
27-10-2020T08:18:20,CrimsonQuill,I beg your pardon?
27-10-2020T08:19:21,CrimsonQuill,Two thousand for brakes?
27-10-2020T08:19:45,Dadrobit,"""Sir, you realize you're getting fleeced right?"" ""Yeah, Dadrobit, I know. But if I get it serviced anywhere else than the dealership, it voids the car's warranty on everything."""
27-10-2020T08:20:10,CrimsonQuill,Oh come off it.
27-10-2020T08:20:25,CrimsonQuill,Now I don't want to buy a Tesla...
27-10-2020T08:21:58,Dadrobit,"They also ""Fixed"" his license plate when three of the screws fell out by reattaching it with silicone caulking. No fucking joke. They didn't even replace the screws, just caulked the back of the plate and stuck it on."
27-10-2020T08:22:39,CrimsonQuill,"That's it, I'm going back to my childhood dream of a Land Rover Defender."
27-10-2020T08:22:50,Dadrobit,His license plate is once again being held on by a single screw as the caulking almost immediately failed.
27-10-2020T08:23:26,CrimsonQuill,That is absolutely ridiculous.
27-10-2020T08:25:29,Dadrobit,"The dealership is 120% fucking over its clients. They're banking on all of them being rich and naieve. Part of the $2,000 brake jobs problems was that, ""the brakes were full of dust."""
27-10-2020T08:26:12,CrimsonQuill,I'm guessing that that's just an excuse for more money?
27-10-2020T08:26:14,Dadrobit,You don't fucking say?!?! Dust? In Arizona?????
27-10-2020T08:26:44,Dadrobit,"Yes, they are the stereotypical mechanic that throws random shit at the customers for more money."
27-10-2020T08:29:49,Dadrobit,"Honestly pretty angry for the kid, has no idea about cars really."
27-10-2020T08:30:03,Dadrobit,Mechanics just roll right over him for his wallet.
27-10-2020T08:30:07,CrimsonQuill,Oof.
27-10-2020T08:30:29,Dadrobit,"I say kid, but he is 18 now."
27-10-2020T08:40:55,Dadrobit,"You know, I wasn't 100% sold on a Day 1 buy for PS5, but now they've got me."

27-10-2020T09:26:37,CrRAR,"ugh, Iâ€™m surprized they need brakes terribly fast cuz of regenerative braking, might explain it just being â€˜dustâ€™"
27-10-2020T09:26:40,CrimsonQuill,Woah...that's neat...
27-10-2020T09:27:06,CrimsonQuill,"Gonna hop off for abit, have to get some stuff done on Revit that I've been procrastinating over."
27-10-2020T09:27:08,CrimsonQuill,Cya
27-10-2020T09:27:14,CrimsonQuill,hops off
27-10-2020T09:27:17,CrRAR,:v: quill
27-10-2020T09:28:32,CrRAR,...and yeah I can see that if the partner dealership is a shitty one that service would be overpriced and sub-par
27-10-2020T09:29:31,CrRAR,Fromm wha I understand I think tesla still just has other mfgr car dealers do their work for them?
27-10-2020T09:30:10,CrRAR,Which woulsd create a situation where the mechanics halfass everything
27-10-2020T10:28:18,K3IDRAN,Damn
27-10-2020T10:28:35,K3IDRAN,I feel bad for you mate
