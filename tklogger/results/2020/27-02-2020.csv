27-02-2020T20:08:08,CrRAR,Because you're awesome.
27-02-2020T20:08:54,CrRAR,Eat some cinnamon-sugar toast it'll calm that whole stomach situation down real good.

27-02-2020T20:43:04,JojoF2415,That seagull is struggling to open the bag
27-02-2020T20:46:43,JojoF2415,The bird gave up and left
27-02-2020T20:47:01,JojoF2415,I can‚Äôt access that bag cause

27-02-2020T21:04:31,MoonDance,Hey hopefully it isn't too much of a hassle. Hope the headache leaves you be!
27-02-2020T21:05:28,SageSaga,it started like 1 minute after the medicine- but then faded after about an hour- but now i think its caused by blood pressure to go way down- so any time i move my head i get a headache

27-02-2020T21:13:00,Ustudios,corona virus just hit mexico... one of the cases is close home... hospital is on fire... not literally
27-02-2020T21:13:39,Ustudios,so Im poofed today haha too much stuff to take in in terms of protection for us and the people at the hospital
27-02-2020T21:14:21,Tharkis,"2 community transmission cases of unknown origin in USA now, with no relation or proximity to travelers"
27-02-2020T21:14:33,Tharkis,"so everyone just remember to wash your hands, a lot, and dont touch your eyes and mouth"
27-02-2020T21:15:05,Ustudios,and use a mask if you can not a gas mas one of the normal ones doctor use
27-02-2020T21:15:17,JojoF2415,It hit mexico already?
27-02-2020T21:16:03,Tharkis,i buy too many @#%@#% shirts
27-02-2020T21:16:12,Chalodraws,I read masks are overrated. its more important to do what tharkis said. Wash your hands often and all that
27-02-2020T21:16:20,Tharkis,i picked up a Crypt of the Necrodancer shirt today at PAX East
27-02-2020T21:16:33,Tharkis,"yeah, masks are more for keeping YOU from spreading contaigon to others"
27-02-2020T21:16:40,Tharkis,not preventing yourself from getting them
27-02-2020T21:16:55,Tharkis,"preventitive masks are entierly different , and are actually respirators not masks"
27-02-2020T21:17:01,JojoF2415,Some kid at school had a mask. He doesn‚Äôt have it anymore
27-02-2020T21:17:24,Ustudios,yeah it hit mexico today\
27-02-2020T21:17:28,SageSaga,i want a hazmat suit
27-02-2020T21:17:39,jirka,Hi Tom :wave:
27-02-2020T21:17:45,Ustudios,I wanna move where chalo lives
27-02-2020T21:17:49,SageSaga,not for the virus- just to scare my nephews after they watch ET
27-02-2020T21:17:54,Tharkis,its' a pretty badass shirt though !  (totally safe for work link)  https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/215577938169430017/683106961977376814/image0.jpg
27-02-2020T21:18:00,Ustudios,aperantly corona cant survive in hot weather
27-02-2020T21:18:00,BadFoMo,Tom is on?
27-02-2020T21:18:11,Tharkis,i have a PAPR respirator for my swordsmithing
27-02-2020T21:18:16,Tharkis,"(not while smithing, while grinding)"
27-02-2020T21:18:20,Roughlandin,"Roughlandin, standing by"
27-02-2020T21:18:26,HoverdudeXL,Hi toms
27-02-2020T21:18:33,Tharkis,but it'd be rather silly to wander around in a full face mask with powered air supply
27-02-2020T21:18:34,JojoF2415,I got used to the 60 F weather
27-02-2020T21:18:46,JojoF2415,Hi Tom
27-02-2020T21:18:50,Zakuru,back to this sketch
27-02-2020T21:18:50,BadFoMo,"Yes, Tom is on."
27-02-2020T21:19:45,BeeMill,"Ey, steam time, what‚Äôs up guys"
27-02-2020T21:19:49,happyguyone,I‚Äôm really starting to get scared about this virus :anguished:
27-02-2020T21:20:26,CrimsonHelsing,You shouldn't. The important thing is not to panic
27-02-2020T21:20:27,BeeMill,Happy - less than 50 cases in the US if you‚Äôre American
27-02-2020T21:20:34,JojoF2415,It‚Äôs already where I live
27-02-2020T21:20:49,HUN76,Virus is dominating Korea!! Help!!
27-02-2020T21:20:51,SageSaga,my insurance wouldnt cover this medication so i had to use a version with a much stronger dose
27-02-2020T21:20:54,JojoF2415,As long as your healthy it‚Äôs ok
27-02-2020T21:21:04,Corinthian,hiya
27-02-2020T21:21:08,BadFoMo,Yo.
27-02-2020T21:21:11,Roughlandin,It's honestly less virulent than the flu for healthy people
27-02-2020T21:21:15,BeeMill,"I mean, it‚Äôs not enough to just be healthy"
27-02-2020T21:21:33,BeeMill,But yeah the mortality rate for coronavirus is due to bad health in China
27-02-2020T21:21:41,Roughlandin,The only people who need to worry are immuno-compromised
27-02-2020T21:21:49,BeeMill,^
27-02-2020T21:21:55,JojoF2415,No bite
27-02-2020T21:21:56,SageSaga,=_= it's 20x stronger than what i need- god my head hurts
27-02-2020T21:22:08,KeefMcDerpface,At this rate you have to be a Basitian to survive this.
27-02-2020T21:22:13,KeefMcDerpface,Also hello.
27-02-2020T21:22:31,Roughlandin,Hoi keef

27-02-2020T21:22:53,KeefMcDerpface,"Ah, I see we're back to Nora doing Nora things."
27-02-2020T21:22:54,JojoF2415,I was too stubborn to ask for help when I fractured my collar bone
27-02-2020T21:22:57,BadFoMo,@SageSaga Maybe you should try sleeping it off?
27-02-2020T21:23:32,SageSaga,too much work to do
27-02-2020T21:23:34,JojoF2415,Until I couldn‚Äôt handle the pain anymore
27-02-2020T21:23:45,SageSaga,tomorrow is the last day of the month too
27-02-2020T21:23:51,BeeMill,"Reminder that however well intentioned chat is, seek medical help if necessary. I doubt anyone here has the knowledge to give practical advice"
27-02-2020T21:24:02,MoonDance,Nothing who on sleeping in after your task
27-02-2020T21:24:02,BadFoMo,Your health should come first.
27-02-2020T21:24:02,SpazztasticKiwi,sage at what point do you consider putting yourself in a medical coma for vacation
27-02-2020T21:24:07,JojoF2415,An extra day this year
27-02-2020T21:24:27,SpazztasticKiwi,it seems your body‚Äôs like a temple
27-02-2020T21:24:33,Roughlandin,Think I'm the closest here and I'm a pharm school dropout
27-02-2020T21:24:34,SageSaga,at the point we can do that and hook our brains up to a Full Dive VR?
27-02-2020T21:24:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"ancient, crumpling and probably haunted"
27-02-2020T21:24:38,KeefMcDerpface,How did you know you fractured your collar bone in the first place? Unless it was after the fact.
27-02-2020T21:24:56,JojoF2415,My stomach is irritated from eating spicy food
27-02-2020T21:25:41,BeeMill,I do not enjoy spicy food
27-02-2020T21:25:53,BeeMill,But that‚Äôs probably just me being white af with my tastes
27-02-2020T21:25:56,Lunarsprint,Hey friends
27-02-2020T21:26:00,Roughlandin,"Is your medication in pill form, Sage? Have you asked your MD if you can split them and try half dosage?"
27-02-2020T21:26:02,KeefMcDerpface,Hello Lunar
27-02-2020T21:26:07,BadFoMo,I would like for that version of VR to come out.
27-02-2020T21:26:25,BadFoMo,"...Also, hi."
27-02-2020T21:26:33,BeeMill,Life VR
27-02-2020T21:26:41,SageSaga,it is not a pill
27-02-2020T21:26:42,JojoF2415,I ate a solid pepper in two bites
27-02-2020T21:26:42,KeefMcDerpface,*Full-Life VR
27-02-2020T21:26:51,Roughlandin,Ah well there goes that idea
27-02-2020T21:26:51,SageSaga,its a cream that gets absorbed into the skin
27-02-2020T21:27:09,KeefMcDerpface,That's a thing? Well then.
27-02-2020T21:27:20,BeeMill,"In theory you could just apply less to get the recommended dosage then, no?"
27-02-2020T21:27:41,JojoF2415,That pepper is equal to a tiny piece of the Carolina reaper
27-02-2020T21:27:42,Roughlandin,Doesn't work quite like that with a cream
27-02-2020T21:27:44,SageSaga,and to use any less than i do i would need some kinda micro applicator
27-02-2020T21:28:00,JojoF2415,That tiny piece was enough to make me cry
27-02-2020T21:28:03,BeeMill,Fair enough
27-02-2020T21:28:06,Roughlandin,"Exactly, they usually only have you apply like a fingertip amount"
27-02-2020T21:28:08,SageSaga,im using the tiniest possible amount that i can - its just so strong
27-02-2020T21:28:27,ShamusTheFox,Pepper talk?
27-02-2020T21:28:44,Roughlandin,We've got peppers mixed with meds. Not a good combo
27-02-2020T21:28:58,ShamusTheFox,That's hardcore.
27-02-2020T21:29:00,JojoF2415,My goal is to eat the ghost pepper next month
27-02-2020T21:29:04,Almighty404,"The coronavirus is just a bad flu, one that due to conditions has mutated and can't be targeted with the usual flu shots."
27-02-2020T21:29:34,Roughlandin,Chat topics are bouncing all over tonight
27-02-2020T21:29:46,KeefMcDerpface,As always.
27-02-2020T21:29:49,Almighty404,So people that would be in danger from a flu can't be given a shot that will protect them.
27-02-2020T21:29:59,BeeMill,"@almighy404 - no it‚Äôs not, don‚Äôt spread misinformation"
27-02-2020T21:30:11,Lunarsprint,"That might also be bi-phasic, and has a raw mortality rate of almost 10% if I remember correctly."
27-02-2020T21:30:19,JojoF2415,I just saw a sting ray pass by
27-02-2020T21:30:22,ShamusTheFox,If there were ever a disease that could be cured by eating a ghost pepper...I would probably die.
27-02-2020T21:30:25,BeeMill,Coronavirus is a family of viruses with similar symptoms to the flu
27-02-2020T21:30:29,KeefMcDerpface,"Jojo, what?"
27-02-2020T21:30:34,Lunarsprint,Nani
27-02-2020T21:30:51,Tharkis,"Coronavirus is not related to flu at all, in fact it's the same family as the common cold"
27-02-2020T21:31:00,KeefMcDerpface,Was that pepper covered in drugs?
27-02-2020T21:31:08,Almighty404,"Well, it's still not more dangerous than the flu for a regular, healthy person that catches it"
27-02-2020T21:31:18,BeeMill,"Again, not true"
27-02-2020T21:31:21,ZRO4825,cannonballs into the chat.
27-02-2020T21:31:28,Tharkis,"what makes this one unique is that it's new in human transmission, it's pre-existed in animals(hence novel corona virus)"
27-02-2020T21:31:34,KeefMcDerpface,dodges ZRO
27-02-2020T21:31:39,Lunarsprint,"""Ho ho, you're moving towards me"""
27-02-2020T21:31:42,SageSaga,Bee is correct
27-02-2020T21:31:43,KeefMcDerpface,"Also, hello ZRO"
27-02-2020T21:31:43,ShamusTheFox,*gets splashed with chat water*
27-02-2020T21:31:48,ZRO4825,Sup folks! '.'/
27-02-2020T21:31:59,JojoF2415,Sup
27-02-2020T21:32:02,SageSaga,yo Zro
27-02-2020T21:32:04,Roughlandin,Hence why the actual mortality is still kind of up in the air
27-02-2020T21:32:27,Almighty404,"Well, my point is, it's less scary than the panic surrounding it makes it sounds."
27-02-2020T21:32:34,Lunarsprint,It's also predisposed to mutation too right?
27-02-2020T21:32:35,Roughlandin,It's not ebola
27-02-2020T21:32:37,Tharkis,Almighty404 it's currently an estimated 30 to 40x more deadly than the flu.  Current accepted mortality rate is 2.5 to 3
27-02-2020T21:32:45,Tharkis,which is an order of magnitude more serious than the flu
27-02-2020T21:32:48,AspiringNoodle,hai strem peeps
27-02-2020T21:32:50,BeeMill,We don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs real mortality rate because it‚Äôs been limited to china for the most part and deaths have been due to preexisting poor health more than actual mortality
27-02-2020T21:33:00,KeefMcDerpface,Hello Noodle
27-02-2020T21:33:03,SageSaga,panic is not good - but it should be taken seriously
27-02-2020T21:33:04,Tharkis,"which is , in an average year, 0.1% and those mostly the very elderly or young"
27-02-2020T21:33:33,Lunarsprint,:ctwokinds-reniderp:
27-02-2020T21:33:39,ShamusTheFox,I just got over the flu. I don't even want to think about going toe to toe with Covid-19.
27-02-2020T21:33:41,Tharkis,"so again, just keep washing your hands, cover your mouth when you cough, sneeze or cough into your sleeve not your hand, instead of hugs or handshakes, try bumping elbows or fistbumps"
27-02-2020T21:33:50,Almighty404,"I'm not saying to not take it seriously, I'm saying that it's not some sort of pandemic you should fear each time you go outside."
27-02-2020T21:34:02,JojoF2415,I just realized my fishing rod had no bait
27-02-2020T21:34:14,Lunarsprint,Stock market tripping balls over it though
27-02-2020T21:34:20,ZRO4825,Discovered a remix of Cosmo Canyon's theme today that is beautiful. =^.^=
27-02-2020T21:34:27,SageSaga,yeah but you also shouldnt spread misinformation about it either
27-02-2020T21:34:28,KeefMcDerpface,What game are you olaying Jojo?
27-02-2020T21:34:31,KeefMcDerpface,*playing
27-02-2020T21:34:31,BeeMill,I‚Äôm not too sacred because back when H1N1 (Swine flu) was going around I caught it in middle school. Ofc I will take precaution to avoid it though
27-02-2020T21:34:37,Roughlandin,Only reason I'm concerned is that my father is on lifetime maintainance chemo
27-02-2020T21:34:41,ShamusTheFox,"How about that Magnum Bullets vid, huh?"
27-02-2020T21:34:44,Lunarsprint,Whatcha fishing JoJo?
27-02-2020T21:35:06,JojoF2415,Small fish near the dock
27-02-2020T21:35:12,KeefMcDerpface,IRL?
27-02-2020T21:35:22,JojoF2415,Yes
27-02-2020T21:35:25,Lunarsprint,"Fresh or salt, region?"
27-02-2020T21:35:26,Almighty404,"I wasn't aware that what I was spreading was misinformation, it was what I understood from an article I read recently, so I'm glad someone could correct my errors."
27-02-2020T21:35:34,JojoF2415,Salt water
27-02-2020T21:35:54,Nekonny,"I undestand the reason behind it, btu I am upset that the sumo tournament and animejapan2020 were canceled"
27-02-2020T21:36:09,Nekonny,and that the ghibli museum is closed also
27-02-2020T21:36:10,Roughlandin,Viral pathology is tricky. Part of the reason I dropped out of pharm school
27-02-2020T21:36:19,JojoF2415,2020 didn‚Äôt have a good start
27-02-2020T21:36:29,TraceLegacyXI,What‚Äôs popping my friends?
27-02-2020T21:36:35,KeefMcDerpface,Hello Trace
27-02-2020T21:36:41,Roughlandin,"Pandemics, apparently"
27-02-2020T21:36:43,ShamusTheFox,"Yo, how goes?"
27-02-2020T21:36:49,TraceLegacyXI,Good. You?
27-02-2020T21:36:51,KeefMcDerpface,And Nora is trying to get in your pants again it seems.
27-02-2020T21:36:59,TraceLegacyXI,Hm?
27-02-2020T21:37:03,Lunarsprint,"US gulf, east or west coast or somewhere else?"
27-02-2020T21:37:03,SageSaga,im really curious about how it came to be and what exactly makes it so much more deadly and infectious - i think figuring out that info will make future outbreaks more preventable
27-02-2020T21:37:05,TraceLegacyXI,Oh I see
27-02-2020T21:37:26,CrRAR,woot
27-02-2020T21:37:33,ShamusTheFox,Nora just looking all come hither?
27-02-2020T21:37:34,Almighty404,"I can understand why ""events where great amount of people gather"" get cancelled if there's chances of spreading from careless sneezing and coughing."
27-02-2020T21:37:51,Roughlandin,I think the current theory is that it was a nonhuman virus that mutated to be cross infectious to humans
27-02-2020T21:37:52,JojoF2415,I‚Äôm out phones about to die
27-02-2020T21:37:53,TraceLegacyXI,Ok then
27-02-2020T21:37:55,KeefMcDerpface,Hello CrRAR
27-02-2020T21:38:02,KeefMcDerpface,Bye Jojo

27-02-2020T21:38:11,ZRO4825,Heyyo Maty ^^
27-02-2020T21:38:11,ShamusTheFox,Laters!

27-02-2020T21:38:17,MatyMaty,'allo!
27-02-2020T21:38:20,KeefMcDerpface,Good luck on fishing Jojo
27-02-2020T21:38:24,SageSaga,i can understand worrying if you are in a massive hub from people all over too - like LA and DC for the US
27-02-2020T21:38:25,Lunarsprint,@Sagesaga I've read it started and bass and may have been a quarantine breach from the bio lab like 200m from the Wuhan fish market
27-02-2020T21:38:28,SageSaga,hey Maty
27-02-2020T21:38:29,JojoF2415,Thanks
27-02-2020T21:38:37,Lunarsprint,*bats
27-02-2020T21:38:44,Tharkis,"ironically what's making this outbreak worse is the fact that it's NOT incredibly lethal.   SARS and MERS are the same family, but their lethality was so high that carriers got sick so fast they didnt have a chance to infect others"
27-02-2020T21:38:53,JojoF2415,I‚Äôm fishing on west coast
27-02-2020T21:38:59,LCArt,wasnt it because of some kind of canids ? (forgot their name)
27-02-2020T21:39:03,TraceLegacyXI,Good luck
27-02-2020T21:39:05,MatyMaty,Hey everyone
27-02-2020T21:39:06,CrRAR,yes very virulent
27-02-2020T21:39:11,CrRAR,much epidemic
27-02-2020T21:39:12,Roughlandin,There's a bunch of theories on how it started
27-02-2020T21:39:13,CrRAR,wow
27-02-2020T21:39:14,TraceLegacyXI,Hey maty
27-02-2020T21:39:21,KeefMcDerpface,Hello Maty
27-02-2020T21:39:26,MatyMaty,"Sage, coronavirus was detected in i city today :P"
27-02-2020T21:39:31,MatyMaty,my city*
27-02-2020T21:39:35,Roughlandin,A big problem is that the Chinese government is not know for being incredibly transparent
27-02-2020T21:39:39,SageSaga,i heard T_T
27-02-2020T21:39:40,CrRAR,Dammit maty
27-02-2020T21:39:49,MatyMaty,and stores are already out of face masks and all of the related stuff
27-02-2020T21:39:53,Lunarsprint,"@jojof2415 not familiar with those fishies, mostly gulf an southern Atlantic Florida"
27-02-2020T21:39:54,CrRAR,wow
27-02-2020T21:39:55,ZRO4825,"Quick, hide the Maty till it's gone D:"
27-02-2020T21:40:07,ShamusTheFox,I heard the face mask trade is booming.
27-02-2020T21:40:27,TraceLegacyXI,My phones lagging out help
27-02-2020T21:40:39,MatyMaty,I dunno if I should worry :P
27-02-2020T21:40:39,Roughlandin,Shoves gerbils into phone
27-02-2020T21:40:40,KeefMcDerpface,Refresh?
27-02-2020T21:40:43,SageSaga,people on amazon are reselling masks at 400%-2000% price hikes
27-02-2020T21:40:45,TraceLegacyXI,I‚Äôll try
27-02-2020T21:40:55,Roughlandin,Capitalism!
27-02-2020T21:41:04,TraceLegacyXI,Ok so refresh didn‚Äôt work
27-02-2020T21:41:04,MatyMaty,"I mean, we went through the H1N1 thing just fine"
27-02-2020T21:41:11,CrRAR,What about scarves? Can't we deal with this in a fashionable manner?
27-02-2020T21:41:11,ZRO4825,Somehow I'm not surprised by people's greed.
27-02-2020T21:41:12,ShamusTheFox,"At these prices, you'd be sick not to buy!"
27-02-2020T21:41:15,KeefMcDerpface,Refresh phone?
27-02-2020T21:41:21,TraceLegacyXI,I did
27-02-2020T21:41:22,Roughlandin,Keep your hands washed and avoid large crowds
27-02-2020T21:41:38,TraceLegacyXI,Is this a crash course on how to not get sick?
27-02-2020T21:41:39,LCArt,"fun fact, face masks dont really help prevent ^^U unless u wear a gas mask..."
27-02-2020T21:41:45,KeefMcDerpface,Which is why I live in the country side.
27-02-2020T21:41:49,TraceLegacyXI,"If it is, I wish to participate"
27-02-2020T21:41:56,SageSaga,scarves are more likely to make you sick
27-02-2020T21:42:06,TraceLegacyXI,I agree
27-02-2020T21:42:10,Roughlandin,Same. Which will be great when the virus goes full necro and the dead start walking
27-02-2020T21:42:15,SageSaga,they get moist from your breath and become a better breeding ground for viruses
27-02-2020T21:42:16,TraceLegacyXI,Which is why I don‚Äôt wear them
27-02-2020T21:42:17,Lunarsprint,Think Corona is more infectious
27-02-2020T21:42:28,LCArt,xD
27-02-2020T21:42:36,TraceLegacyXI,Why is that funny?
27-02-2020T21:42:41,CrRAR,darn it sage and your facts!
27-02-2020T21:42:42,CrRAR,xD
27-02-2020T21:42:44,TraceLegacyXI,I mean ok but why?
27-02-2020T21:42:46,Almighty404,The idea with face masks is that INFECTEES are supposed to wear them.
27-02-2020T21:42:48,LCArt,regular flu is way deadlier than coronavirus ^^U
27-02-2020T21:42:52,CrRAR,I'm glad you did your research though
27-02-2020T21:43:01,Lunarsprint,Some people just wanna watch the world burn
27-02-2020T21:43:02,Roughlandin,We're going in circles
27-02-2020T21:43:05,SageSaga,LCArt- that isnt true
27-02-2020T21:43:05,CrRAR,Quality bro for the apocalypse confirm't
27-02-2020T21:43:09,TraceLegacyXI,I‚Äôm just completely lost right now
27-02-2020T21:43:12,LCArt,do the numbers ^^U
27-02-2020T21:43:18,TraceLegacyXI,What‚Äôre we talking about?
27-02-2020T21:43:22,SageSaga,you dont know how numbers work
27-02-2020T21:43:27,TraceLegacyXI,Nope
27-02-2020T21:43:29,Roughlandin,People are trying to do the numbers
27-02-2020T21:43:32,TraceLegacyXI,Oh
27-02-2020T21:43:34,KeefMcDerpface,Chat has become a war zone apperently.
27-02-2020T21:43:35,Roughlandin,Pathologists
27-02-2020T21:43:38,TraceLegacyXI,So I‚Äôm just a moron
27-02-2020T21:43:41,CrRAR,:three::three::three::three::seven:
27-02-2020T21:43:41,TraceLegacyXI,Ok
27-02-2020T21:43:54,TraceLegacyXI,I understand now
27-02-2020T21:43:55,Almighty404,Regular flu being deadlier over all the time it spread to humans is normal if it started spreading to humans EONS ago rather than this year.
27-02-2020T21:43:55,ZRO4825,Yummy lookin Kaylin sketch so far. ^_^
27-02-2020T21:44:10,TraceLegacyXI,Nora scares me
27-02-2020T21:44:24,LCArt,"simply search ""regular flu vs coronavirus"" ;)"
27-02-2020T21:44:25,Almighty404,Good scare or bad scare ?
27-02-2020T21:44:30,TraceLegacyXI,Both?
27-02-2020T21:44:38,Almighty404,Naughty scare then ?
27-02-2020T21:44:40,KeefMcDerpface,That grin.
27-02-2020T21:44:46,TraceLegacyXI,"I don‚Äôt know, she‚Äôs... special?"
27-02-2020T21:44:52,Lunarsprint,Like walking on your friends parents?
27-02-2020T21:44:55,LCArt,not sure why media wants to scare us so much :\
27-02-2020T21:44:56,SageSaga,LCArt- do i really need to explain this?
27-02-2020T21:44:58,Roughlandin,LCArt if you can find me the scientific study feel free.
27-02-2020T21:45:01,TraceLegacyXI,I did that once
27-02-2020T21:45:05,TraceLegacyXI,I regret it
27-02-2020T21:45:13,TraceLegacyXI,As any decent person would
27-02-2020T21:45:18,TraceLegacyXI,At least I hooe
27-02-2020T21:45:23,TraceLegacyXI,*hope
27-02-2020T21:45:29,SageSaga,If you try to say something is more deadly because more people have died from it- then you dont understand statistics at all
27-02-2020T21:45:41,Roughlandin,USA today is a great medical journal
27-02-2020T21:45:47,TraceLegacyXI,Yes
27-02-2020T21:45:51,TraceLegacyXI,Yes it is
27-02-2020T21:45:55,SageSaga,people have been dying of the flu for hundreds of years in recorded history
27-02-2020T21:46:04,Almighty404,"That was my point, too"
27-02-2020T21:46:08,LCArt,"infectious? sure, it is. Dealy? nah, most casualitie are old ppl, aka low defenses"
27-02-2020T21:46:13,TraceLegacyXI,Then corona shows up and people make a huge fuss
27-02-2020T21:46:27,CrRAR,"That's whey everythings being locked down, to STOP it from being more deadly statistically."
27-02-2020T21:46:27,Roughlandin,Mortality is measured per year
27-02-2020T21:46:28,TraceLegacyXI,Chill out people
27-02-2020T21:46:29,Lunarsprint,@LCArt probably some political she'll game look over here so my buddy can stab u
27-02-2020T21:46:37,Lunarsprint,Shell
27-02-2020T21:46:39,SageSaga,but the percentage of those infected that die is low- the percentage of those infected with Corona die more often
27-02-2020T21:46:43,TraceLegacyXI,Corona is just influenza 2.0
27-02-2020T21:46:49,Tharkis,"no, it is not"
27-02-2020T21:46:54,TraceLegacyXI,Anyone following my logic here?
27-02-2020T21:46:57,TraceLegacyXI,No?
27-02-2020T21:46:59,TraceLegacyXI,Ok
27-02-2020T21:46:59,KeefMcDerpface,Nope.
27-02-2020T21:47:02,TraceLegacyXI,Fair
27-02-2020T21:47:03,SageSaga,its bad logic
27-02-2020T21:47:11,TraceLegacyXI,My logic is pretty flawed I admit
27-02-2020T21:47:12,CrRAR,Don't worry guys we're all safe we never leave our computers anyway.
27-02-2020T21:47:13,Roughlandin,Dogs are just cats 2.0
27-02-2020T21:47:16,KeefMcDerpface,Which is why I'm not following it.
27-02-2020T21:47:22,Tharkis,"anyhow gotta reboot, brb"
27-02-2020T21:47:24,CrRAR,No need to panic
27-02-2020T21:47:30,Roughlandin,Water bears are just bears 1.0
27-02-2020T21:47:31,TraceLegacyXI,CrRAR... you are a soothsayer
27-02-2020T21:47:37,Inscrutable,Introducing Dogs+
27-02-2020T21:47:39,TraceLegacyXI,This man speaks prophecies

27-02-2020T21:48:00,KeefMcDerpface,Does Dogs+ do my taxes?
27-02-2020T21:48:04,Inscrutable,Yes
27-02-2020T21:48:08,TraceLegacyXI,I hope so
27-02-2020T21:48:12,Roughlandin,No one is panicking. There's a difference between panic and just being wrong. The flu is an entirely different species of virus
27-02-2020T21:48:15,ShamusTheFox,"I don't panic. ...well, maybe about taxes. And doing that school report I forgot about for months in my dreams."
27-02-2020T21:48:15,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
27-02-2020T21:48:28,TraceLegacyXI,Yes

27-02-2020T21:48:51,TraceLegacyXI,I agree
27-02-2020T21:48:53,Almighty404,...CV infectees that never get diagnosed and heal
27-02-2020T21:48:54,TraceLegacyXI,Very much

27-02-2020T23:39:02,henner,"anyway this condition made it to where she could generate so much power that it could be used for extremely powerful weaponry and technology, so she was kidnapped, turned into a biomech, and would be used to take over the government"
27-02-2020T23:39:16,KeefMcDerpface,oh
27-02-2020T23:39:26,KeefMcDerpface,So she's a battery.

27-02-2020T23:45:59,henner,"well yes she is a battery so to speak, but her power is used to power things that are on her body, like a mana powered artillery lazer cannon inside of her head, high speed jet turbines, some internal systems"
27-02-2020T23:46:23,KeefMcDerpface,Inside her head?!
27-02-2020T23:46:31,MagicEnchilladas,but does she connect to wifi?
27-02-2020T23:46:32,CrRAR,robodurgon
27-02-2020T23:46:46,KeefMcDerpface,Does she have railguns?
27-02-2020T23:46:54,CrRAR,Important question: equipped with port and starboard attachments?
27-02-2020T23:47:03,ThingsAreMoving,Is all that weaponry even necessary?
27-02-2020T23:47:04,Kynum,She would love to be Trace's wifi
27-02-2020T23:47:11,ZRO4825,lawlz
27-02-2020T23:47:11,KeefMcDerpface,pfft
27-02-2020T23:47:17,Roughlandin,My battery dragon is probably mostly going to get used to keep a bratty noble kid from dying like a scrub. Also the princess his heart is currently inside of... It's a weird story.
27-02-2020T23:47:18,henner,theres MUCH more in terms of her story and design and i could go over all the little details and the anti-aircraft blades but id rather not make toms chat even more packed than it already is
27-02-2020T23:47:45,SageSaga,That's Dragonheart
27-02-2020T23:47:51,KeefMcDerpface,Anti-aircraft blades?!
27-02-2020T23:47:54,MagicEnchilladas,I ask that because for some reason I see her as an elaborate shitposter
27-02-2020T23:47:56,Roughlandin,Yeah kinda Sage
27-02-2020T23:48:14,Roughlandin,"Only the kid's heart is in the princess, not the dragon's"
27-02-2020T23:48:21,ThingsAreMoving,Rip Draco. He was too good for this world
27-02-2020T23:48:28,SageSaga,did you know they made another dragonheart movie?
27-02-2020T23:48:34,Kynum,wat?
27-02-2020T23:48:37,Kynum,no way
27-02-2020T23:48:37,Roughlandin,Yeah I saw. It's on netflix
27-02-2020T23:48:40,CrRAR,sneaky
27-02-2020T23:48:40,ThingsAreMoving,There's like six of them now
27-02-2020T23:48:44,KeefMcDerpface,I found out a few months back.
27-02-2020T23:48:50,SageSaga,that's 5 too many
27-02-2020T23:48:51,KeefMcDerpface,Six?!
27-02-2020T23:48:59,Roughlandin,I thought it was five
27-02-2020T23:49:06,MagicEnchilladas,"ah yes, the sharknado curse"
27-02-2020T23:49:09,Roughlandin,But still. One was enough
27-02-2020T23:49:14,Roughlandin,Same with Highlander
27-02-2020T23:49:18,CrRAR,"Joker silently mouths: ""Six"""
27-02-2020T23:49:20,ThingsAreMoving,"Sorry, this one is nr. 5"
27-02-2020T23:49:38,ThingsAreMoving,"And yeah, I was surprised as well"
27-02-2020T23:49:57,Roughlandin,"I'd say it was too many, but there are never too many sexy dargums"
27-02-2020T23:50:03,SageSaga,number 5 has such a terrible name
27-02-2020T23:50:18,ThingsAreMoving,Dragonheart: Vengeance ?
27-02-2020T23:50:25,Kynum,Dragonspleen?
27-02-2020T23:50:25,SageSaga,yes
27-02-2020T23:50:29,Kynum,oh
27-02-2020T23:50:36,SageSaga,Dragonheart Vengeance
27-02-2020T23:50:48,ThingsAreMoving,Haven't seen it yet.
27-02-2020T23:50:57,CrRAR,almost as bad as Dragonball: Evolution as far as title
27-02-2020T23:51:01,SageSaga,im pretty surei wont watch it
27-02-2020T23:51:12,ThingsAreMoving,But no matter what it'll always be better than that one Dragon movie nobody wants to remember.
27-02-2020T23:51:12,henner,"like i said, this was designed to be a weapon capable of leveling cities in the matter of minutes, the project did fail in a good way since the biomech is bieng controlled by an innocent young woman rather than programming, the point is...."
27-02-2020T23:51:14,Roughlandin,Dragonheart Vengeane: Dragon Harder
27-02-2020T23:51:16,Ordithus,"speaking of durgons, lookit this majestic doofus :ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:"
27-02-2020T23:51:30,henner,"yes, for what it was supposed to be, all that weaponry was neccesary"
27-02-2020T23:51:33,KeefMcDerpface,lol Rough
27-02-2020T23:51:54,KeefMcDerpface,Railguns and lasers would have been enough.
27-02-2020T23:51:55,CrRAR,don't call doofus she turn you into a noofus
27-02-2020T23:52:06,Roughlandin,Make ya go poofus

27-02-2020T23:53:18,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-adiracoin:*[Shut up and take my money]
27-02-2020T23:53:24,henner,"its just 1 giant lazer and like four razor sharp hook things that were designed to cut fighter jets in half, not too much weaponry..."
27-02-2020T23:53:59,Roughlandin,Random dragon based tangeant: Saphira from Eragon is the sexiest dragon ever put to film. Too bad she was in such a snoozefest of a movie...
27-02-2020T23:54:09,KeefMcDerpface,And if a fighter has a laser cannon on it?
27-02-2020T23:54:14,KeefMcDerpface,And railguns?
27-02-2020T23:54:23,SageSaga,Haku was sexier
27-02-2020T23:54:25,ThingsAreMoving,Rough... that's the dragon movie no one wants to remember.
27-02-2020T23:54:32,ThingsAreMoving,"Also, Sage I have to agree"
27-02-2020T23:54:33,henner,i dont know what a railgun is.
27-02-2020T23:54:37,MagicEnchilladas,power consumption would be the issue with the jet
27-02-2020T23:54:41,henner,probably something i should know
27-02-2020T23:54:46,Roughlandin,Haku was a sexy Riverboi
27-02-2020T23:55:09,MagicEnchilladas,basically a magnetic slingshot henner
27-02-2020T23:55:13,KeefMcDerpface,^
27-02-2020T23:55:14,ThingsAreMoving,railgun is a gun where a projectile is being sped up by electromagnets to supersonic speeds
27-02-2020T23:55:24,KeefMcDerpface,^
27-02-2020T23:55:25,MagicEnchilladas,a better explanation^
27-02-2020T23:55:30,henner,"if i go on the internet right now and search railgun, i garuntee you the next mechanical monster i design will be covered in railguns...."
27-02-2020T23:55:38,henner,oh
27-02-2020T23:55:43,KeefMcDerpface,Only one should do.
27-02-2020T23:55:45,henner,im a slow typer

27-02-2020T23:56:41,KeefMcDerpface,"Unless we're talking about the Nosferatu, that jet had two railguns."
27-02-2020T23:57:26,Roughlandin,"*Kicks Dragon* ""This baby can hold so many railguns!"""
27-02-2020T23:57:31,KeefMcDerpface,lol
27-02-2020T23:57:41,ThingsAreMoving,Don't kick the dragon! :ctwokinds-renirawr:
27-02-2020T23:57:54,MagicEnchilladas,"yeah, you will break your foot"
27-02-2020T23:57:55,henner,"about the turbines, they are designed to run off the power that the dragon attracts alone, it is so much that the designers didnt even think twice about power consumption"
27-02-2020T23:58:12,Roughlandin,Dragon steps on foot. Now I have a pancake foot.
27-02-2020T23:58:50,Ordithus,Like Barf after Yogurt stepped on him!
27-02-2020T23:59:15,Roughlandin,Half of my conversation is just Space Balls and Princess Bride references
27-02-2020T23:59:23,Sclimshady,"No, its cause lone star broke concentration on the schwartz"
27-02-2020T23:59:34,Ordithus,technicalities
27-02-2020T23:59:42,henner,did i even put the link in for the  design or am i just sitting here running my mouth?
