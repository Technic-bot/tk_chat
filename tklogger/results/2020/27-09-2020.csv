27-09-2020T19:50:32,ChampionOfBagels,honestly I think the background would make a great piece by itself. It'd be a gorgeous computer background
27-09-2020T19:50:45,BadFoMo,I agree.
27-09-2020T19:51:12,BadFoMo,...Can we get it without Kathrin too.

27-09-2020T22:19:40,CrRAR,I always wondered how that could realistically be used xD
27-09-2020T22:19:59,CrRAR,It was mostly good for making a mess goofing around w/ it
27-09-2020T22:20:55,Twokinds,"I try to avoid using the pen tool, but it's handy for very large curves that need to be smooth"
27-09-2020T22:21:31,unsteddyphoenix,Why avoid using it? is it a bad habit or somethin?
27-09-2020T22:21:43,CrRAR,"Yeah, it just seems like something that's a hell of a lot more trouble than it's worth"

27-09-2020T22:32:47,TheSexyBeast,Tea is important and good for you.
27-09-2020T22:32:49,Ordithus,Maddie's chair is different from Maeve's.  The arms blended into the other part coming from the back

27-09-2020T22:35:50,Stormagedon,"i would say though, the connection would have to be stronger. All of the weight is concentrated on that one point"

27-09-2020T22:36:21,Twokinds,"Well it's two points, on either side"
27-09-2020T22:36:21,TobyTTobes,haha yes Tom it's a struggle with anthropomorphic animals. I struggle with pants and dress so much because of that. However the challenge is fun! Big reason why I'm big on antro animals.
27-09-2020T22:36:38,Twokinds,"And if it's all one piece of metal, going around, it would be fine"
27-09-2020T22:36:48,CrRAR,"They look wrought iron, they can take it"
27-09-2020T22:36:51,Ordithus,the back to chairs like this usually is just a couple points I think
27-09-2020T22:37:09,Stormagedon,"Hmmm, you bring up a point"
27-09-2020T22:37:15,KeefMcDerpface,They could be enhanced magically to not bend no matter how much pressure they're put under.
27-09-2020T22:37:20,Stormagedon,a good point
27-09-2020T22:37:20,Ordithus,yeah plenty of examples if you do a search

27-09-2020T22:56:14,Kynum,hm
27-09-2020T22:56:23,Kynum,it seems I still have much to learn
27-09-2020T22:56:49,TobyTTobes,What you mean?
27-09-2020T22:57:39,Zakuru,im trying to not get photoshop :sob: i don't wanna give adobe my money
27-09-2020T22:57:51,AspiringNoodle,I know that feel
27-09-2020T22:57:57,AspiringNoodle,"Photoshop so good, but eff adobe"
27-09-2020T22:58:10,Kynum,"Honestly, I've been trying to find a alternative"
27-09-2020T22:58:27,Kynum,"not very hard, mind you."
27-09-2020T22:58:32,Kynum,But I'm trying. x3
27-09-2020T22:58:40,Zakuru,csp is always best alternative
27-09-2020T22:58:44,AspiringNoodle,"A program solely for digital art, or a legitimate photoshop replacement with all the bells and whistles?"
27-09-2020T22:58:47,Kynum,That's what I use
27-09-2020T22:58:53,Zakuru,then you're good ;3
27-09-2020T22:59:05,Kynum,I mean I want the photo editing ability
27-09-2020T22:59:13,AspiringNoodle,Try Affinity Photo
27-09-2020T22:59:16,Kynum,"With illustration, I'm good with CSP"
27-09-2020T22:59:18,Kynum,"Affinity, eh?"
27-09-2020T22:59:29,AspiringNoodle,"Yup, they're trying to make an alternative to do the Adobe ecosystem"
27-09-2020T22:59:45,Kynum,I'll try to remember that
27-09-2020T22:59:47,BadFoMo,Try GIMP?
27-09-2020T22:59:55,Kynum,do they also have a vector program like Illustrator?
27-09-2020T23:00:52,AspiringNoodle,Designer is Affinity's version of Illustrator
27-09-2020T23:01:15,AspiringNoodle,"The last program they have is Publisher, and that's word stuff"
27-09-2020T23:01:31,AspiringNoodle,"Iirc, all programs are $50"
27-09-2020T23:01:40,Kynum,.......
27-09-2020T23:01:44,Kynum,most interesting
27-09-2020T23:01:50,Kynum,"MOST interesting, indeed"
27-09-2020T23:01:53,Kynum,"Thanks, folks!"
27-09-2020T23:02:13,AspiringNoodle,"I bought CSP awhile back on sale after trying both, because Photo was lagging with my old computer :ptv-laugh:"
27-09-2020T23:02:31,AspiringNoodle,"Then again... that was probably more indicative of my computer's specs, more than anything."
27-09-2020T23:02:40,Kynum,I bought CSP on sale as well. When my adobe subscription ran out
27-09-2020T23:02:49,AspiringNoodle,"Not a bad purchase, mind you!"
27-09-2020T23:02:52,AspiringNoodle,CSP is so good~
