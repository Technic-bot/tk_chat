02-04-2020T20:26:19,SorrowMan,"I'm mainly a light novel author, as well as a webcomic publisher."
02-04-2020T20:26:25,unsteddyphoenix,This would ruin the shoulder
02-04-2020T20:26:28,Roughlandin,I write parts of stories and then overthink myself and stop. Then I get bored and move onto another story I'll probably never finish
02-04-2020T20:26:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,But if we fussed we can make a head
02-04-2020T20:26:45,Roughlandin,Also I troll Tom's patreon with pervy little skits
02-04-2020T20:28:21,ZRO4825,"I dabble occasionally in writing and a very small amount into artwork lately. Was working on teaching myself to play flute, but I need a better flute. My cheap one...well, cheap is as cheap does, so it sticks badly already. :joy:"

02-04-2020T20:31:19,Roughlandin,I play a mean ocarina in Animal Crossing
02-04-2020T20:32:58,ZRO4825,"Flute is a fun instrument to learn for me. Always enjoyed the sound of them, but I played Trombone and Baritone back in school, lol."
02-04-2020T20:33:25,ZRO4825,Relearning what notes are where on the music sheet is all sorts of screwy though. Haven't played anything in treble clef since like 6th grade. :joy:
02-04-2020T20:36:35,Nekonny,https://youtu.be/c-XfG_Xe6GM?t=5

02-04-2020T20:39:22,ZRO4825,I said at times twice. Damn my brain that re-runs the sentences 5 times while I'm typing it once...
02-04-2020T20:39:22,Mihari,I kinda expect that from you ZRO :P

02-04-2020T20:58:07,Nekonny,it feels like nobody's at the controls....
02-04-2020T20:59:21,ZRO4825,I wonder if they're delaying stuff like that to figure out if they're even going to be a thing this year.
02-04-2020T21:00:25,Nekonny,"well, last year they weren't that great at responding to things either"
02-04-2020T21:00:38,Nekonny,so it might just be business as usual
02-04-2020T21:01:32,ZRO4825,"lol, well, that is the better option in the circumstance, but here's to hoping that's all it is."
02-04-2020T21:03:04,BadFoMo,@SageSaga Hmm?
02-04-2020T21:03:19,ZRO4825,"Sage is writing words on screen. That either bodes quite well, or not well at all. :P"

02-04-2020T22:04:02,BlackjackSec99,Night!
02-04-2020T22:04:15,Almighty404,I agree that many people wear masks for no reason.

02-04-2020T22:05:39,Almighty404,"I don't miss going outside, I miss having the choice to go outside"
02-04-2020T22:05:41,AspiringNoodle,Bye ron :c
02-04-2020T22:05:53,BadFoMo,Inb4 Tom: Is he gone?
02-04-2020T22:06:00,AspiringNoodle,*starts streaming*
02-04-2020T22:06:15,ThoseButterflys,idk
02-04-2020T22:06:24,Ordithus,I've gone for a walk everyday of this.  It's actually been nice
02-04-2020T22:06:46,Ordithus,"Well, aside from today.  Sleet, freezing rain, and snow."
02-04-2020T22:06:47,AspiringNoodle,I love still having to work at the gas station
02-04-2020T22:06:58,AspiringNoodle,I've started silently judging people :upside_down:
02-04-2020T22:07:22,Almighty404,"We need to fill a paper with the reasons for us being outside, or else risk facing huge fines."
02-04-2020T22:07:32,ZRO4825,Only started to?
02-04-2020T22:07:41,ZRO4825,I've been doing that for pretty much the entirety of my working time.
02-04-2020T22:07:54,AspiringNoodle,"Well, I normally don't give 2 sh*ts about what people buy at a gas station"
02-04-2020T22:08:07,Almighty404,You waited to work to start judging ?
02-04-2020T22:08:13,AspiringNoodle,"But in the middle of a pandemic, you bet your sweet @$$ I'm gonna judge if you come in and buy a single pack of gum"
02-04-2020T22:08:45,Almighty404,What if they try to buy a single roll of toilet paper ?
02-04-2020T22:08:56,Ordithus,good on them for not hoarding
02-04-2020T22:09:01,ThoseButterflys,duh why not try to find cheap toilet paper
02-04-2020T22:09:01,Ordithus,means they really needed it
02-04-2020T22:09:11,unsteddyphoenix,language >:(
02-04-2020T22:09:14,AspiringNoodle,That's a bit different.  I actually had a couple come in earlier today and said that my store was the 3rd they tried
02-04-2020T22:09:23,AspiringNoodle,"#!@*, sorry steddy"
02-04-2020T22:09:31,AspiringNoodle,"...oh no, I think I can't swear anymore"
02-04-2020T22:09:31,unsteddyphoenix,>:O
02-04-2020T22:09:41,AspiringNoodle,I can only censor D:
02-04-2020T22:09:41,SageSaga,my store still has no toilet paper- i might really have to order that bidet
02-04-2020T22:10:01,ThoseButterflys,oof
02-04-2020T22:10:16,ZRO4825,o.o;
02-04-2020T22:10:29,Ordithus,Need me to ship some or something
02-04-2020T22:10:57,SageSaga,i think Mihari has offered to ship me some- i might have to ask her to actually do it
02-04-2020T22:10:58,RimaDraws,i can too
02-04-2020T22:10:59,Grip,Not good. The store in town doesn't have any right now but they are trying to keep things stocked up.
02-04-2020T22:11:03,ThoseButterflys,I dont know why a lung disease has people buying toilett paper
02-04-2020T22:11:34,SageSaga,because ya gotta stay in your home for 2 months and try not to go out as much as possible-
02-04-2020T22:11:37,ZRO4825,"Because while a person might be intelligent, people as a whole are fricking stupid."
02-04-2020T22:11:43,Almighty404,Because people are afraid of running out of toilet paper
02-04-2020T22:11:56,Grip,Media claimed it might cause some other issues toilet paper related.
02-04-2020T22:12:04,Almighty404,"Thus they go and hoard them, making it a self-fulfilling prophecy"
02-04-2020T22:12:09,AspiringNoodle,Inb4 next pandemic causes deadly diarrhea
02-04-2020T22:12:14,AspiringNoodle,And people hoard tissue paper
02-04-2020T22:12:17,Sclimshady,Relevant MIB quote https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/600415756722634824/688506196667269201/EOqZrTtWkAAD-I-.png
02-04-2020T22:12:41,Ordithus,MIB might be the origin of that?
02-04-2020T22:12:43,AspiringNoodle,"Love that quote, love that franchise"
02-04-2020T22:12:48,Grip,Its funny though that one roll can last 32 days and a mega roll can handle 128 days.
02-04-2020T22:12:48,ZRO4825,"If you're using enough toilet paper to go through a full shopping cart's worth, you need to be taught how to wipe your ass properly again, or stop eating taco bell. <_<;;;"
02-04-2020T22:13:10,Ordithus,"should shut down taco bell in this crisis, conserve toilet paper"
02-04-2020T22:13:22,RimaDraws,lol
02-04-2020T22:13:22,AspiringNoodle,How about shutting down Chipotle?
02-04-2020T22:13:33,ZRO4825,"Can't anymore, people would cry that doing so is racist in this ""modern"" age. :P"
02-04-2020T22:13:34,Almighty404,"That'll probably sound like I'm tooting my own horn, but I'm glad most of the time I'm not part of ""People"" even in a crowd."
02-04-2020T22:13:42,Ordithus,no shutting down chipotle
02-04-2020T22:13:44,Grip,"nine mega rolls can last 1,152 days and that is more then enough."
02-04-2020T22:13:46,SageSaga,im not sure how one roll can last a whole month-
02-04-2020T22:13:49,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-flomad:
02-04-2020T22:13:54,AspiringNoodle,"""Ah, so you've chosen death..."""
02-04-2020T22:14:23,Almighty404,Comes with the territory of being neuroatypical in my way.
02-04-2020T22:14:25,IronHorseComics,"the answer's simple Sage, black magic"
02-04-2020T22:14:31,IronHorseComics,that's how one would last for a month
02-04-2020T22:14:35,Ordithus,or a bidet
02-04-2020T22:14:40,SageSaga,this says a standard pack of FOUR rolls lasts 32 days
02-04-2020T22:14:43,Almighty404,How can one roll NOT last a month ?
02-04-2020T22:14:44,AspiringNoodle,*be Doctor Strange*
02-04-2020T22:14:50,AspiringNoodle,*reverse time on used toilet paper*

02-04-2020T22:14:53,IronHorseComics,what are they 1-ply?
02-04-2020T22:15:10,IronHorseComics,or do they expect you to only use 2 squares at a time?
02-04-2020T22:15:58,Ordithus,:csagesaga-bounce:
02-04-2020T22:16:17,ZRO4825,"I like your thinking, Ord."
02-04-2020T22:16:55,Almighty404,I agree with Ord's last post.
02-04-2020T22:17:09,SageSaga,here ya'll need this apparently- link is self explanatory - https://howmuchtoiletpaper.com
02-04-2020T22:17:48,ZRO4825,lol
02-04-2020T22:18:26,IronHorseComics,don't you just love it when a link is self explanitory?

02-04-2020T22:22:04,SageSaga,i dont think ive ever seen a mean butt- however- i dont think they are entirely impossible to exist
02-04-2020T22:22:42,BadFoMo,You've never seen a Bad Ass?
02-04-2020T22:23:02,SageSaga,that was actually a good pun

02-04-2020T22:26:48,LannAF,How are you all today?
02-04-2020T22:27:03,RimaDraws,fair...
02-04-2020T22:27:35,SageSaga,i kinda want anthrocon to cancel so i can get my plane ticket money back and put it towards a bidet because there's still not toilet paper here
02-04-2020T22:27:50,IronHorseComics,sleepy
02-04-2020T22:28:08,LannAF,I don't want ac to cancel :C
02-04-2020T22:28:10,AspiringNoodle,Hoi Lann
02-04-2020T22:28:13,BadFoMo,I'm fine; you?
02-04-2020T22:28:14,RimaDraws,me either
02-04-2020T22:28:15,LannAF,"Because if it doesn't cancel, ash and karen can come"
02-04-2020T22:28:22,LannAF,then I'll actually feel far more comfortable
02-04-2020T22:28:33,SageSaga,didnt you already cancel?
02-04-2020T22:28:39,LannAF,"Hoi Noodle, I'm ok BadFoMo"
02-04-2020T22:28:40,LannAF,No.
02-04-2020T22:28:51,SageSaga,Silver thought you did- which is why he already did
02-04-2020T22:29:06,BadFoMo,That pillow looks angry.
02-04-2020T22:29:06,LannAF,I mentioned they put refunds up
02-04-2020T22:29:12,LannAF,But I haven't even gotten my AC ticket.
02-04-2020T22:29:28,LannAF,The hotel itself I won't back out on until it's confirmed
02-04-2020T22:29:34,LannAF,but...Honestly it's probably cancelled.
02-04-2020T22:30:01,RimaDraws,yea probably...
02-04-2020T22:30:17,LannAF,eh
02-04-2020T22:30:23,LannAF,we'll go to a different one

02-04-2020T22:31:00,RimaDraws,woo
02-04-2020T22:31:03,BadFoMo,I just had a dumb idea. What if AnthroCon was hosted on a MineCraft server or the like?
02-04-2020T22:31:22,SageSaga,hard to sell merch on a minecraft server
02-04-2020T22:31:22,LannAF,wouldn't feel special.
02-04-2020T22:31:26,LannAF,that too.
02-04-2020T22:31:39,LannAF,"also, Sage, how about we go somewhere this year instead once everything blows over?"
02-04-2020T22:32:54,LannAF,am so excited
02-04-2020T22:32:58,LannAF,My valve index is coming soon
02-04-2020T22:33:09,SageSaga,come to VA and we will go to Hallowscream together if it's not cancelled too
02-04-2020T22:33:13,LannAF,and I have somebody down to be my vr partner :DD

02-04-2020T22:33:33,LannAF,I'm interest since Fright Dome has been shut down
02-04-2020T22:33:35,RimaDraws,i guess ill just find another thing to do. i need new friends to hang with
02-04-2020T22:33:36,IronHorseComics,"AnthroSoutheast is on Halloween this year, I'll have enough spoops thank you very much"
02-04-2020T22:33:36,LannAF,interested*
02-04-2020T22:33:39,LannAF,What's it like?
02-04-2020T22:34:08,SageSaga,the park itself is awesome- but the decoration for halloween and all the awesome spooky stuff- i could just walk around all day and have fun
02-04-2020T22:34:17,LannAF,Is there haunted house things?
02-04-2020T22:34:19,SageSaga,it's a gorgeous place
02-04-2020T22:34:23,SageSaga,oh yeah
02-04-2020T22:34:24,LannAF,or pure scenery
02-04-2020T22:34:32,SageSaga,they usually have like 3-4 haunted houses
02-04-2020T22:34:36,SageSaga,a few special haunted rides
02-04-2020T22:34:38,IronHorseComics,"Busch Gardens, is that in Boston? I can't remember"
02-04-2020T22:34:43,LannAF,hmmm
02-04-2020T22:34:45,SageSaga,Williamsburg VA

02-04-2020T22:35:12,SageSaga,i will actually go one at least one roller coaster too-
02-04-2020T22:35:20,SageSaga,i normally dont ride them
02-04-2020T22:35:33,SageSaga,but there are 2 i might be ok on
02-04-2020T22:35:42,LannAF,I uh
02-04-2020T22:35:43,RimaDraws,ive never been on a real one
02-04-2020T22:35:45,SageSaga,i dont handle inversions well though
02-04-2020T22:35:47,LannAF,I'm terrified of roller coasters.
02-04-2020T22:35:52,LannAF,Like mega terrified.
02-04-2020T22:36:01,unsteddyphoenix,Huh. Suprising
02-04-2020T22:36:03,LannAF,Sticky loves them though
02-04-2020T22:36:05,FoxxTrotter,I prefer wooden roller coasters over the steel ones.
02-04-2020T22:36:08,LannAF,And wants me to go on one.
02-04-2020T22:36:11,SageSaga,google invadr and see if you think you could handle that Lann
02-04-2020T22:36:12,Ordithus,"same, Foxx"
02-04-2020T22:36:14,unsteddyphoenix,You sound perfect to go on rollercoasters with
02-04-2020T22:36:54,RimaDraws,i am scared of heights
02-04-2020T22:37:09,LannAF,yup I could handle that sage
02-04-2020T22:37:13,LannAF,heck yeah let's do it together
02-04-2020T22:37:19,SageSaga,thats one of the 2 im ok with trying
02-04-2020T22:37:24,unsteddyphoenix,hold hands
02-04-2020T22:37:38,LannAF,sage probs wouldn't let me.
02-04-2020T22:37:51,LannAF,Sticky is down for it sage
02-04-2020T22:37:59,SageSaga,the other is called- Verbolten i think
02-04-2020T22:38:26,FoxxTrotter,"Those are at Busch Gardens in Williamsburg, aren't they?"
02-04-2020T22:38:27,LannAF,"Honestly, it might also be cheaper than AC costs"
02-04-2020T22:38:41,RimaDraws,i need a vacation to go to if AC shuts down
02-04-2020T22:38:53,FoxxTrotter,Haven't been there in over 20 years.
02-04-2020T22:39:09,LannAF,Our cancun trip is probably getting delayed or refunded :/
02-04-2020T22:39:16,LannAF,I was looking forward to it so badly.
02-04-2020T22:39:29,RimaDraws,i told the bf if we couldnt see each other at AC he can come visit me
02-04-2020T22:39:35,SageSaga,i generally only take business trips XD
02-04-2020T22:39:40,LannAF,unless I'm involved

02-04-2020T22:40:32,RimaDraws,very

02-04-2020T22:41:01,LannAF,But that's not including extras.
02-04-2020T22:41:09,LannAF,you don't needa do that man
02-04-2020T22:41:13,LannAF,I want to help cover yours
02-04-2020T22:41:22,LannAF,and sticky is working too so she'd probs save up some too.
02-04-2020T22:41:30,LannAF,I was originally intending on paying all of it
02-04-2020T22:41:34,SageSaga,yeah but an extra 3000 dollars would be nice
02-04-2020T22:41:37,LannAF,True.
02-04-2020T22:41:50,LannAF,But I can't really take 2 weeks off during my school anyways.
02-04-2020T22:41:57,LannAF,I don't have those freedoms as an apprentice.
02-04-2020T22:42:03,LannAF,I mean I COULD.
02-04-2020T22:42:14,RimaDraws,i have to wait to go out of country after school is done
02-04-2020T22:42:15,LannAF,"just, big loss of hours."
02-04-2020T22:42:17,SageSaga,i can sell my entire collection in under 12 hours for 2.4k right now
02-04-2020T22:42:22,LannAF,jesus.

02-04-2020T22:42:32,ZRO4825,o.o;;
02-04-2020T22:42:42,SageSaga,none of my friends will even play it with me! T_T
02-04-2020T22:42:46,LannAF,"If by next year, costs look good and I can save a good chunk of money after paying off my car"
02-04-2020T22:42:55,LannAF,let's do it for my second year graduation
02-04-2020T22:42:56,Sclimshady,LANNNN
02-04-2020T22:42:59,LannAF,IF things look good
02-04-2020T22:43:01,LannAF,SCLIMMMM OMG
02-04-2020T22:43:03,unsteddyphoenix,Damn is there really speed demand from MTG cards?
02-04-2020T22:43:15,LannAF,I just got great fricking news
02-04-2020T22:43:17,RimaDraws,hi sclim
02-04-2020T22:43:19,LannAF,My Valve index is shipping soon.
02-04-2020T22:43:24,Sclimshady,Hi Rima!
02-04-2020T22:43:25,LannAF,I SHALL BE INDEXED.
02-04-2020T22:43:25,SageSaga,there's a market for it that's always willing to buy
02-04-2020T22:43:32,RimaDraws,i dont know how i am gonna get people's badges to them if AC is cancelled
02-04-2020T22:43:42,LannAF,visit them individually
02-04-2020T22:43:47,RimaDraws,uh....
02-04-2020T22:43:49,LannAF,sneak it in their mouth while they sleep at night
02-04-2020T22:43:51,RimaDraws,i cant...
02-04-2020T22:43:56,LannAF,that sounds bad.
02-04-2020T22:44:00,RimaDraws,they all live out of state
02-04-2020T22:44:09,Sclimshady,Should I call the police
02-04-2020T22:44:09,SageSaga,thats the trick to playing MTG- the value of card usually goes up eventually so if you hold long enough values go up with time not down
02-04-2020T22:44:14,Ordithus,sounds like an adventure of a lifetime
02-04-2020T22:44:14,LannAF,always sclim.
02-04-2020T22:44:22,LannAF,"so it's like, nerdy investments"
02-04-2020T22:44:27,RimaDraws,might just call it off
02-04-2020T22:44:28,RimaDraws,idk
02-04-2020T22:44:29,SageSaga,so if you spend 300 dollars on a deck- its not like you are down 300 dollars- it holds its value usually
02-04-2020T22:44:33,Sclimshady,Magic cards are legit investments
02-04-2020T22:44:36,unsteddyphoenix,mtg inflation
02-04-2020T22:44:54,LannAF,sage see how much it is worth next year.
02-04-2020T22:45:04,SageSaga,think about it this way- when i was a young lad i saw a Black Lotus at the store that was selling for 300 dollars
02-04-2020T22:45:11,LannAF,jaysus.
02-04-2020T22:45:14,LannAF,wait
02-04-2020T22:45:15,SageSaga,i should have bought it- because it now sells for 44k
02-04-2020T22:45:17,LannAF,isn't that the op card?
02-04-2020T22:45:18,LannAF,yep
02-04-2020T22:45:20,Sclimshady,Imagine if you had a black lotus
02-04-2020T22:45:40,LannAF,Btw
02-04-2020T22:45:48,LannAF,lowest plane tickets I saw for Japan were 512$
02-04-2020T22:46:05,LannAF,Ron has also been informing me when they're cheap xD
02-04-2020T22:46:05,Sclimshady,Didnt an uncut sheet of lotuss go for a TON
02-04-2020T22:46:06,SageSaga,"""Mom! Buy me that card!"" ""How much is it?"" ""300 dollars!"" ""NO WAY!"" ""TRUST ME!"""
02-04-2020T22:46:18,LannAF,dude wait though
02-04-2020T22:46:22,LannAF,if you could time travel
02-04-2020T22:46:37,LannAF,Getting a ton of investments would be really suspect or winning the lottery
02-04-2020T22:46:50,LannAF,"if you just invested a ton into black lotus cards, who the heck would investigate that?"
02-04-2020T22:47:00,Sclimshady,Just make one really crazy investment
02-04-2020T22:47:12,LannAF,hm
02-04-2020T22:47:12,SageSaga,dude i used to legit own an original dual land- you know how much those sell for now?
02-04-2020T22:47:14,LannAF,I suppose.
02-04-2020T22:47:19,Sclimshady,Like 500
02-04-2020T22:47:20,LannAF,at least 2 dollars sage.
02-04-2020T22:47:48,SageSaga,it was an Bayou from Alpha- go ahead- look it up
02-04-2020T22:47:55,Sclimshady,Maybe those were the reprints

02-04-2020T22:55:10,SageSaga,even with Elon screwing everything up over and over?
02-04-2020T22:55:21,LannAF,dude
02-04-2020T22:55:26,LannAF,tesla went to the moooon
02-04-2020T22:55:30,LannAF,it was crazy
02-04-2020T22:55:35,LannAF,and then it dipped
02-04-2020T22:55:36,unsteddyphoenix,Probably still fine really
02-04-2020T22:55:37,LannAF,then it soared again
02-04-2020T22:55:44,LannAF,imo it's gonna go back for sure.
02-04-2020T22:55:56,Ordithus,stil worth what it was in January
02-04-2020T22:55:58,LannAF,It's volatile as fuck but definitely worth an investment if you buy a dip.
02-04-2020T22:57:08,BlackjackSec99,awesome
02-04-2020T22:57:11,BlackjackSec99,errrr

02-04-2020T22:57:32,BlackjackSec99,"Ide still buy tesla, or, SpaceX"
02-04-2020T22:58:43,SageSaga,if you bought into Bitcoin when it was dirt cheap and got out before the crash i think you're fine- you dont need to invest again really
02-04-2020T22:59:31,Ordithus,"that's not how you become filthy rich, only rich"
02-04-2020T22:59:59,BlackjackSec99,"ok, ide buy spaceX, honestly, because I really would be investing in making the company better because I believe in what they are doing."
02-04-2020T23:00:11,SageSaga,do you really want to be filthy rich though? i feel like you then have to deal with being seen as a terribly rich person by everyone at that point
02-04-2020T23:00:29,Ordithus,sorry I can't hear the wailing over my money
02-04-2020T23:00:30,SageSaga,i would want to be rich but not rich enough to appear on any top 100 lists
02-04-2020T23:00:56,FoxxTrotter,Heh...had to look a second. Elon is a town an hour away from here. I see that you're talking about a different Elon. :0P

02-04-2020T23:01:39,LannAF,and crash it into the home of someone I don't like
02-04-2020T23:01:47,SageSaga,you dont need to be filthy rich to  do that Zro XD
