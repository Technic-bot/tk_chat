08-12-2020T16:10:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I was hammering out the scale
08-12-2020T16:11:11,SpazztasticKiwi,cat sleeps on you => girlfriend sleeps on you => Nora is asleep on you
08-12-2020T16:11:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"that last one, it doesn’t matter if you want to get up"
08-12-2020T16:12:11,CrRAR,"Nora... you had better permit, because in that case your life depends on it"
08-12-2020T16:12:36,CrRAR,yes
08-12-2020T16:13:10,SpazztasticKiwi,and then that last sketch had me think of the cat Nora factor
08-12-2020T16:13:23,SpazztasticKiwi,can you
08-12-2020T16:13:27,SpazztasticKiwi,or dare you try
08-12-2020T16:15:17,CrRAR,She’s very accomodating to schedules
08-12-2020T16:15:23,SpazztasticKiwi,this is real science

08-12-2020T16:23:24,CrRAR,sometimes I get weird reactions for some reason
08-12-2020T16:23:40,SpazztasticKiwi,you know at work we get kits to make the deli sandwiches you see in the coolers
08-12-2020T16:23:48,CrRAR,Yet chips with ANY other sandwich is normal
08-12-2020T16:23:52,CrRAR,:ptv-laugh:
08-12-2020T16:24:03,CrRAR,Oh really?
08-12-2020T16:24:05,SpazztasticKiwi,each one that has pickles comes with a huge tub of pickles in the box
08-12-2020T16:24:14,CrRAR,Like perfect little portions?
08-12-2020T16:24:23,CrRAR,wow
08-12-2020T16:24:50,CrRAR,Like 3 lil pickels in a package does sound weird
08-12-2020T16:24:58,SpazztasticKiwi,so at any given point we end up with 40something tubs of new pickles in the cooler because there’s no way you’re gonna use the whole thing for one sandwich kit
08-12-2020T16:25:12,CrRAR,probably just easier and cheaper to package up a reasonable amount
08-12-2020T16:25:23,CrRAR,wow
08-12-2020T16:25:33,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s 48 oz of pickles
08-12-2020T16:25:35,SpazztasticKiwi,per box
08-12-2020T16:25:46,CrRAR,Just start asking people if they want extra pickles
08-12-2020T16:25:47,SpazztasticKiwi,and yes chips on pbj is weird
08-12-2020T16:26:29,CrRAR,"Not on it just with, though I might have to experiment"
08-12-2020T16:26:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"now, even putting extra pickles on, which we’re not allowed to do because there’s a certain way we’re supposed to make them and there’s still only so much you can stuff on a sandwich"
08-12-2020T16:26:40,CrRAR,They would get soggy
08-12-2020T16:26:48,CrRAR,Ah
08-12-2020T16:26:49,SpazztasticKiwi,also there’s a point that it gets soggy yeah
08-12-2020T16:27:10,CrRAR,Oh is this for wrapped sandwiches?
08-12-2020T16:27:22,CrRAR,or made-to-order?
08-12-2020T16:27:29,SpazztasticKiwi,wrapped
08-12-2020T16:27:37,CrRAR,Ah okay makes sense
08-12-2020T16:27:47,SpazztasticKiwi,also also we can’t sell them because they’re part of production/don’t have a barcode or a price we can’t sell them
08-12-2020T16:28:06,CrRAR,What knind of pickles are they?
08-12-2020T16:28:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I had a day where I threw out something close to 20 unopened jars into compost
08-12-2020T16:28:18,CrRAR,"Assorted, depending?"
08-12-2020T16:28:26,CrRAR,on sandwich
08-12-2020T16:28:32,SpazztasticKiwi,they’re sandwich chips

08-12-2020T21:08:23,Osean,that is one confused looking Sil and I love it

08-12-2020T21:12:34,w0lfmare,brb!
08-12-2020T21:12:44,Blackironwolf,Ok!
08-12-2020T21:13:56,CrRAR,ok k
08-12-2020T21:17:36,w0lfmare,Ok back
08-12-2020T21:17:46,Osean,welcome back!
08-12-2020T21:18:00,w0lfmare,Really starting to get excited about the idea of getting a new tablet :eyes:
08-12-2020T21:18:15,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-Emberflail:
08-12-2020T21:18:27,Blackironwolf,Wb!
08-12-2020T21:18:31,w0lfmare,I've had the same Cintiq for 7 years
08-12-2020T21:18:56,Blackironwolf,Ohh that would be sweet!
08-12-2020T21:19:12,Osean,I really need to start using XP-Pen. Been putting off learning to draw for too long
08-12-2020T21:19:34,w0lfmare,The tablet itself was released in 2004
08-12-2020T21:19:47,Osean,ody
08-12-2020T21:19:49,Osean,oldy
08-12-2020T21:19:51,CrRAR,No better time of year
08-12-2020T21:19:55,CrRAR,:gift:
08-12-2020T21:20:01,w0lfmare,So there's 16 years of improvements
08-12-2020T21:20:09,Ordithus,"wow, that's gonna be a leap"
08-12-2020T21:20:12,Osean,I imagine a new tablet would be very nice
08-12-2020T21:20:14,Blackironwolf,*gasping*
08-12-2020T21:20:19,CrRAR,:rocket:
08-12-2020T21:20:28,CrRAR,*groovy space noises*
08-12-2020T21:20:30,Osean,"where is the ""Get Wolf a new tablet"" fund?"
08-12-2020T21:20:41,w0lfmare,"Never really thought about it, because I've been very happy with my tablet"
08-12-2020T21:20:56,Ordithus,worked then works now
08-12-2020T21:21:11,CrRAR,Tablets have advanced but not the same as how far OTHER tech has come in 16 years
08-12-2020T21:21:16,w0lfmare,"I'm going to make a tip jar soon, I want to upgrade my PC too"
08-12-2020T21:22:21,CrRAR,I feel like tablets mostly have become more reasonable/accessible since all that long ago
08-12-2020T21:22:21,Osean,"Then again, I already give large monthly tips XD"
08-12-2020T21:22:23,w0lfmare,My computer is I think a 6 year old gaming laptop?
08-12-2020T21:22:31,CrRAR,Ah neat
08-12-2020T21:22:45,Osean,My current laptop is about 2 and a half years old
08-12-2020T21:23:11,CrRAR,Computers from 6 years ago was a good era
08-12-2020T21:23:33,Ordithus,"yeah still pretty decent for most things, maybe not the latest games"
08-12-2020T21:23:38,CrRAR,I feel like tech goes through “awkward phases” every so often for a year or two
08-12-2020T21:23:51,CrRAR,"Gets lost, gotta find itself"
08-12-2020T21:24:01,CrRAR,Emerges VICTORIOUS
08-12-2020T21:24:07,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-power:
08-12-2020T21:24:15,w0lfmare,"I only ever really replace hardware when it's impossible to use anymore, but my current setup has lasted impressively long XD"
08-12-2020T21:24:31,AspiringNoodle,"As cool as computers are, we're still pushing the envelope.  Stuff that we couldn't DREAM of years ago is now reality"
08-12-2020T21:24:38,CrRAR,Yeah cherish it when its good
08-12-2020T21:24:41,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-LauraCry:
08-12-2020T21:24:45,w0lfmare,It's starting to fail me just because of their technical specs
08-12-2020T21:24:54,CrRAR,tru
08-12-2020T21:25:42,AspiringNoodle,I read somewhere you can more or less group people into two time ranges for computer upgrades
08-12-2020T21:25:55,CrRAR,yeah
08-12-2020T21:26:01,AspiringNoodle,"The most bleeding edge people will replace their GPUs every 6 - 18 months, CPUs 2 - 3 years"
08-12-2020T21:26:07,CrRAR,Like architecture groups
08-12-2020T21:26:22,CrRAR,Popular socket platforms and such
08-12-2020T21:26:34,AspiringNoodle,"More casual folks will do GPUs every 2 - 3 years or more, and CPUs can last 5 - 10 years or more"
08-12-2020T21:26:42,CrRAR,Eventually along the timelike there were duds and stepping stones
08-12-2020T21:26:53,Ordithus,I'm in that second group
08-12-2020T21:27:01,AspiringNoodle,some components in my PC has a defined lifetime
08-12-2020T21:27:21,CrRAR,yeah best to be proactive about some things
08-12-2020T21:27:34,AspiringNoodle,"CPU goes when the last generation of AM4 comes around.  At that point, I'll upgrade to something with more cores (that I'll hopefully actually be USING)"
08-12-2020T21:28:08,Ordithus,dat tooth
08-12-2020T21:28:24,AspiringNoodle,X570 is super overbuilt for the 3rd gen processors they came with.  You could push the 16-core 3950X to its limit and barely work the power phases
08-12-2020T21:29:05,CrRAR,"Intel was good the years right before all the spectre mistakes, then good again the last few gens, but AMD obviously is killing it again yeah"
08-12-2020T21:29:09,AspiringNoodle,"Currently using a 3700X (8-core), can't wait to see what CPU will be the last generation of AM4"
08-12-2020T21:29:16,w0lfmare,Hyena snaggletooth
08-12-2020T21:29:32,CrRAR,cyoot
08-12-2020T21:29:41,AspiringNoodle,"Intel had one horrible practice with its processors for the last decade, the whole ""tick tock"" cycle"
08-12-2020T21:29:52,AspiringNoodle,"Mobos were only good for a 2-year stretch, then you had to ditch them.  Talk about e-waste"
08-12-2020T21:30:04,CrRAR,Well ticktock is what got them out of the Pentium 4 doldrums
08-12-2020T21:30:14,CrRAR,They got crazy complacent
08-12-2020T21:30:24,CrRAR,"But yeah rode it too long, got lazy again"
08-12-2020T21:30:29,AspiringNoodle,"Controversy surrounding first gen AM4 boards aside, AMD is now on their 4th gen of processors on the SAME socket"
08-12-2020T21:30:48,AspiringNoodle,And they are posed to dethrone intel as the performance king now more than ever
08-12-2020T21:30:59,Osean,Viv looking adorable and up to no good
08-12-2020T21:31:31,Ordithus,right on both counts
08-12-2020T21:31:37,AspiringNoodle,That is the face of pure chaos :P
08-12-2020T21:31:41,CrRAR,"Intel shot itself in the foot when the spectre stuff needed patching which reduced performance back like 2 gens, and probably distracted all their dang focus."
08-12-2020T21:32:11,CrRAR,AMD was immune due to different archetecture
08-12-2020T21:32:28,AspiringNoodle,...I wonder if my 150i pro will be able to handle more cores
08-12-2020T21:32:33,CrRAR,...and owning fabs has made Intel way to clumsy at this point
08-12-2020T21:32:38,CrRAR,*too
08-12-2020T21:32:50,AspiringNoodle,"the 3700x gets pretty toasty even at idle temps, though I do think that's due to their crazy high voltages"
08-12-2020T21:33:16,CrRAR,They can probably just revise it in new processors
08-12-2020T21:33:20,CrRAR,Maybe a shrink?
08-12-2020T21:33:52,AspiringNoodle,The load temps are fine
08-12-2020T21:34:04,AspiringNoodle,But I'm idling at 33 - 38C with a 360mm AIO
08-12-2020T21:34:07,CrRAR,Intel did those “high-k” transistor gates which reduced electron leak
08-12-2020T21:34:19,CrRAR,Maybe if AMD isn’t doing that yet they can
08-12-2020T21:35:48,CrRAR,Gotta corral those freewheelin electrons
08-12-2020T21:38:27,CrRAR,"oh noodle, if you liked ‘The Cat Returns’ have you seen ‘A Whisker Away’? It’s kinda similar, you might like it."
08-12-2020T21:40:16,AspiringNoodle,Yup :P
08-12-2020T21:40:22,AspiringNoodle,I've seen everything :ptv-uneasy:
08-12-2020T21:41:51,CrRAR,lol
08-12-2020T21:42:26,CrRAR,Just found it after finding Maquia like yesterday.

08-12-2020T21:47:53,w0lfmare,Suppose it felt weirder than it probably was
08-12-2020T21:48:02,w0lfmare,But it was soooo good
08-12-2020T21:48:22,CrRAR,lol
