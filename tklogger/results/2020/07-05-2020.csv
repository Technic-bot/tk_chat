07-05-2020T02:10:15,AspiringNoodle,All I know if that my head got SUUUUUUUPER floaty for a bit.  And after that peak it slowly disappeared
07-05-2020T02:10:16,SpazztasticKiwi,you’v mentioned close to two other times of drinking here
07-05-2020T02:10:29,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s called a buzz

07-05-2020T02:11:31,AspiringNoodle,And then the last time before that I can't even remember. 0 alcohol between any of these instances
07-05-2020T02:12:33,SpazztasticKiwi,that you remember

07-05-2020T02:17:21,AspiringNoodle,This last week is arguably the most I've ever drank in my life.  I can go months without touching the stuff

07-05-2020T02:30:27,SpazztasticKiwi,drink if you want or not - I don’t
07-05-2020T02:31:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I was stating what’s currently memorable - it’s not that deep

07-05-2020T03:03:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I watch & deal exclusively in horror concerning media

07-05-2020T18:48:51,CrRAR,no they probably don't most acquisitions are just in the interest of enhancing the bottom line and expect the headless business to continue running w/o proper leadership
07-05-2020T18:49:03,AspiringNoodle,And hour cuts

07-05-2020T20:27:43,SageSaga,breast dont just get bigger as you get older!
07-05-2020T20:27:45,CrRAR,Does that have a Windows Ink setting? I know that can interfere pretty stupidly.
07-05-2020T20:27:51,unsteddyphoenix,Darn big boobs. I hate that!
07-05-2020T20:27:59,IronHorseComics,I don't...
07-05-2020T20:28:03,CrRAR,"useful soetimes, not all the times"
07-05-2020T20:29:21,Nekonny,sarah is still young though
07-05-2020T20:29:32,SageSaga,she is not that young
07-05-2020T20:29:45,GeoGangWatch,Wowzers!
07-05-2020T20:29:51,CrRAR,gee willikers
07-05-2020T20:29:53,Nekonny,19? 20?
07-05-2020T20:30:04,MachGao,i thought she was 19
07-05-2020T20:30:11,MachGao,since she had an 18th birthday party in the comic
07-05-2020T20:30:13,SageSaga,generally breast stop growing at 17-18
07-05-2020T20:30:18,Nekonny,chalo said 20
07-05-2020T20:30:27,MachGao,its been 2 years in comic?
07-05-2020T20:30:27,MachGao,wow
07-05-2020T20:30:32,Mihari,"Breasts generally stop growing at age 14-16 very rarely later, only getting better if you get exception overweight, or your hormones hate you when you have kids."

07-05-2020T20:31:05,Nekonny,Chalk it up to Prime genetics then
07-05-2020T20:31:16,Mihari,I'll chalk it up to artists liking big :P
07-05-2020T20:31:22,Mihari,No more no less :P
07-05-2020T20:31:31,Shoobidy,Everybody but Rachael
07-05-2020T20:31:42,Mihari,Even she's gotten a little bigger :P
07-05-2020T20:31:48,SageSaga,even if i like big boobs i have an appreciation for all sizes
07-05-2020T20:31:55,hyneria,"Hello Chalo, Nekonny and everyone"
07-05-2020T20:32:00,MachGao,rachael has indeed gotten bigger since she first appeared
07-05-2020T20:32:01,Nekonny,^
07-05-2020T20:32:02,CrRAR,ello
07-05-2020T20:32:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Proportionate is best imo
07-05-2020T20:32:24,hyneria,Didn't Chalo drew Mihari with a rather unusually big size once?
07-05-2020T20:32:40,Mihari,"As a joke yes, and even he admitted he didn't overly like the end result XD"
07-05-2020T20:32:48,CrRAR,"""When in Rome"" or whatever"
07-05-2020T20:32:52,Nekonny,curious to see that again
07-05-2020T20:33:02,Mihari,"I can throw it to you on discord, sec."
07-05-2020T20:33:05,unsteddyphoenix,You CAN have late growth spurts to be fair
07-05-2020T20:33:15,hyneria,IIRC it was pretty nsfw
07-05-2020T20:33:16,unsteddyphoenix,Just post it here >.>
07-05-2020T20:33:21,unsteddyphoenix,Oh nvm lol
07-05-2020T20:33:33,Nekonny,yes please ^^
07-05-2020T20:33:46,SageSaga,late is usually 2-4 years after puberty- not 6-8 years after
07-05-2020T20:34:01,RimaDraws,hi sage
07-05-2020T20:34:09,hyneria,Hopefully Chalo draws Mihari again soon. Would be fun to see her in his current art style
07-05-2020T20:34:11,SageSaga,yo Rima
07-05-2020T20:34:16,unsteddyphoenix,I had a friend who had a huuge growth spurt at the age of 19
07-05-2020T20:34:17,BadFoMo,Yo.
07-05-2020T20:34:21,unsteddyphoenix,That was pretty wild

07-05-2020T20:34:40,SageSaga,congrats to your friend winning the freak genetic lottery? XD
07-05-2020T20:34:42,Mihari,"I will say this about Chalo's atleast his girls might slowly get bigger, as he grows, but atleast they are always proportional. That's a big deal."
07-05-2020T20:35:19,Mihari,"The cows looks like Cows, and cats are believable XD"
07-05-2020T20:35:33,hyneria,isn't Tila a cat? :P

07-05-2020T20:36:17,SageSaga,unfortunately it was a lot more painful than large boobs or random growth spurt
07-05-2020T20:36:19,unsteddyphoenix,Man I wish I had huge boobs like sage

07-05-2020T20:45:09,KeefMcDerpface,wb Noodle
07-05-2020T20:45:16,Twokinds,I dunno. I'm skeptical
07-05-2020T20:45:18,AspiringNoodle,"Ooooo, and Chalo and Ron join us this week? :ptv-ohmy:"
07-05-2020T20:45:40,SageSaga,yeah i wouldnt call it Redfall yet- seems likely to be fake
07-05-2020T20:45:40,Ordithus,yee it's a full house
07-05-2020T20:45:52,Twokinds,There was a time when Bethesda was my favorite game company but I'm pretty disillusioned at this time.
07-05-2020T20:46:04,AspiringNoodle,"^  It's a sad club to be in, for sure :("
07-05-2020T20:46:23,unsteddyphoenix,Have a new fave?
07-05-2020T20:46:27,unsteddyphoenix,EA?
07-05-2020T20:46:29,AspiringNoodle,"After Fallout 76, they can't afford ES6 or Starfall to fail"
07-05-2020T20:46:44,Twokinds,"No, no favorites anymore"
07-05-2020T20:46:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Not even cdpr?
07-05-2020T20:46:53,SageSaga,doesnt matter if they cant afford it-
07-05-2020T20:47:07,K3IDRAN,ES6 Is bethesda only hope for now
07-05-2020T20:47:09,Mihari,"Wayforward, Riot, and  CD Projekt are all I really have faith in anymore."
07-05-2020T20:47:15,CrRAR,yeah. studios evolve... sometimes for the worse.
07-05-2020T20:47:17,Mihari,"Well, and ID Software"
07-05-2020T20:47:22,SageSaga,Riot?
07-05-2020T20:47:41,Mihari,(Hytale backing)
07-05-2020T20:47:45,Mihari,They get in the list just for that
07-05-2020T20:47:47,SageSaga,yeah but- League
07-05-2020T20:47:54,Mihari,I have no problem with league
07-05-2020T20:48:00,Mihari,It's just not my type of game
07-05-2020T20:48:02,HoverdudeXL,Has tom posted the page yet
07-05-2020T20:48:08,IronHorseComics,you could just play TF2
07-05-2020T20:48:13,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah its fine. Riot got in trouble for their office culture a while ago though
07-05-2020T20:48:15,IronHorseComics,or World of Warships
07-05-2020T20:48:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,league gave us that KDA music video.  So I'm pleased
07-05-2020T20:48:39,unsteddyphoenix,They do have sick animations
07-05-2020T20:48:44,Mihari,Riot's videos / music have been stellar
07-05-2020T20:48:49,unsteddyphoenix,Have you seen the true danage one?
07-05-2020T20:48:58,Mihari,I would love a whole universe spin off on that galaxy warriers
07-05-2020T20:49:01,SageSaga,im still nervous about Tencent's control in games
07-05-2020T20:49:09,Zakuru,didn't they not even credit the person who made the KDA video?
07-05-2020T20:49:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Teddy, Have not yet"
07-05-2020T20:49:14,SageSaga,and Riot is mostly owned by Tencent
07-05-2020T20:49:23,unsteddyphoenix,Riots been owned by tencent for aaages though
07-05-2020T20:49:42,unsteddyphoenix,Give it a look. Its similar quality to KDA
07-05-2020T20:49:56,unsteddyphoenix,And one of the characters is thiccccc so
07-05-2020T20:50:02,SageSaga,yeah and theres been lot of shady stuff reported - it just doesnt seem to affect a lot of RIot games- unless *conspiracy*
07-05-2020T20:50:24,Mihari,Riot is clearly the Jinx of Tencent
07-05-2020T20:50:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,This has a little bit of a Max Anarchy feel.  I like it :eyes:
07-05-2020T20:50:49,unsteddyphoenix,Which Jinx :thinking:
07-05-2020T20:50:58,Mihari,All of them? XD
07-05-2020T20:51:13,unsteddyphoenix,I...sure!
07-05-2020T20:51:36,SageSaga,i was surprised about the Valorant news
07-05-2020T20:51:40,AspiringNoodle,Man... why does picarto always hate Ron???
07-05-2020T20:51:58,KeefMcDerpface,So you're having lag too?
07-05-2020T20:52:04,SageSaga,it was disabling peoples keyboards and mice
07-05-2020T20:52:09,AspiringNoodle,His stream's been nonstop buffering
07-05-2020T20:52:11,Nekonny,Me?
07-05-2020T20:52:15,Ordithus,"everyone's streams are having issues for me,"
07-05-2020T20:52:20,Mihari,"You seem to have a lot of dropped frames, Ron."
07-05-2020T20:52:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Infinite loading wheel here too
07-05-2020T20:52:25,Nekonny,hum
07-05-2020T20:52:26,unsteddyphoenix,Oh yeaaah. I heard that SOMETHING was weird about Valorant.
07-05-2020T20:52:28,Nekonny,let me see
07-05-2020T20:52:32,unsteddyphoenix,Its still closed beta though
07-05-2020T20:52:44,Mihari,"I see fine pen strokes, but your N-chan is stuttering like crazy"
07-05-2020T20:52:48,AspiringNoodle,Valorant has kernel-level anti-cheat software.  Das a big no no
07-05-2020T20:52:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Valorant's anti cheet installs some shady software on peoples PC's, teddy"
07-05-2020T20:53:01,SageSaga,both are stuttering on my end for Ron
07-05-2020T20:53:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,cheat even
07-05-2020T20:53:18,K3IDRAN,Khajiit has never seen Keidran up close before
07-05-2020T20:53:18,unsteddyphoenix,Oh no!
07-05-2020T20:53:26,unsteddyphoenix,Hopefully that doesnt last
07-05-2020T20:53:30,SageSaga,anti-cheat stuff in generally is kinda shady
07-05-2020T20:53:31,Mihari,Two streams might be too much for little Neko internet.
07-05-2020T20:53:35,AspiringNoodle,What makes it even shadier is that their anti-cheat starts up the same time the system does.  So that stuff is running while your system is.
07-05-2020T20:53:49,SageSaga,it needs lots of blanket permissions to search for cheating software
07-05-2020T20:54:00,SageSaga,so even if it's all legit- its gonna seem shady
07-05-2020T20:54:14,CrRAR,"yeah, how else can it tell what you're doing w/o seeing what you're doing xD"
07-05-2020T20:54:14,AspiringNoodle,"So, we have an anti-cheat ""solution"" that never stops running once installed, and has access to the lowest levels of your system"
07-05-2020T20:54:32,AspiringNoodle,Sounds like the perfect solution where nothing could go wrong if someone managed to crack their code
07-05-2020T20:54:32,Nekonny,""" little Neko internet"".... :ptv-unimpressed:"
07-05-2020T20:54:35,AspiringNoodle,Nope. Not at all.
07-05-2020T20:54:48,Ordithus,:eyes: itsa Reni
07-05-2020T20:55:03,Mihari,"Don't gimme that look, you thought it was cute, don't lie."
07-05-2020T20:55:03,Nekonny,hows that?
07-05-2020T20:55:13,CrRAR,":ccrrar-reni:*[oh no, the ATTENTION!]"
07-05-2020T20:55:18,Nekonny,abit
07-05-2020T20:55:24,Mihari,Looking good so far.
07-05-2020T20:55:34,Nekonny,still dropping frames?
07-05-2020T20:55:52,BadFoMo,Back.
07-05-2020T20:55:57,KeefMcDerpface,wb
07-05-2020T20:55:58,Mihari,Hrm... yes.
07-05-2020T20:56:01,AspiringNoodle,"Well, it's definitely an improvement :ptv-laugh:"
07-05-2020T20:56:04,K3IDRAN,*uses dragonrend on Nora*
07-05-2020T20:56:06,AspiringNoodle,At least now I get movement!
07-05-2020T20:56:07,Mihari,But huge improvement
07-05-2020T20:56:12,SageSaga,only you can really tell if its dropping frames Ron
07-05-2020T20:56:34,Nekonny,updated obs and stopped some other things that migth have been using bandwith
07-05-2020T20:56:43,SageSaga,"we will only see stutters, skips and delays"
07-05-2020T20:56:43,Nekonny,although now I have to draw in scilence
07-05-2020T20:57:05,Mihari,"Like I said for me, your work seems to be going fine, but the n-chan has finer frame movments that are much more noticable."
07-05-2020T20:57:05,BLADEDGE,hi
07-05-2020T20:57:07,AspiringNoodle,I want to live in the future where the entire world has access to gigabit internet
07-05-2020T20:57:07,Nekonny,I'll just listin to the audio coming from chalos room XD
07-05-2020T20:57:11,AspiringNoodle,Hi Blade
07-05-2020T20:57:29,KeefMcDerpface,Hello Blade
07-05-2020T20:57:39,BadFoMo,"Nekonny's stream is still freazing on me, but not as bad as it was when we started."
07-05-2020T20:57:50,Mihari,"Music shouldn't be much of an impact at all, Ron.  You can still listen XD"

07-05-2020T23:08:45,SageSaga,you shouldnt call them that either
07-05-2020T23:09:15,thestooge2222,"I know, but atleast that ""localization"" would've mad some semblance of sense."
07-05-2020T23:09:17,SageSaga,Riceballs is more appropriate because rice cakes are a thing in western countries
07-05-2020T23:09:19,Chalodraws,its a very rough doodle. so dunno
07-05-2020T23:09:26,steelabjur,Someone should tell Trace to get his hand off the fourth wall. ;p

07-05-2020T23:11:20,SageSaga,pretty much all asian foods existed in western countries but the point is they are rice balls and they arent rice cakes
07-05-2020T23:12:11,thestooge2222,I thought the point was it was pointless to call them anything different
07-05-2020T23:12:13,SageSaga,"can you imagine if they called them rice cakes and some kid said they wanted rice cakes? They would try them and realize ""oh no- Brock is poor"""

07-05-2020T23:13:33,BLADEDGE,"well, The exact origin of fortune cookies is unclear, though various immigrant groups in California claim to have popularized them in the early 20th century."
07-05-2020T23:13:54,Rainelover,"Never mind, they are from San Francisco"
07-05-2020T23:14:09,Mihari,Hong Kong Noodle Company is where they get confused because of the name of hte company that made them XD

07-05-2020T23:17:30,AspiringNoodle,"After all, it was devised as a treatment for epilepsy"
07-05-2020T23:17:30,BLADEDGE,@SageSaga Ehhhh to the Fad Diet or to the Science?
07-05-2020T23:17:39,Mihari,But it's been proven enough not to be a fad.
07-05-2020T23:18:09,SageSaga,yeah i wouldnt say it's a fad- it has some 100% uses that are possitive
07-05-2020T23:18:14,AspiringNoodle,"We know it's not a fad, but 1) It's hard to maintain and 2) As stated, no longer-term evidence"
07-05-2020T23:18:15,SageSaga,namely for diabetics
07-05-2020T23:18:21,Happyguyone,i love kimi's pose in this one nekonny
07-05-2020T23:18:31,SageSaga,but as a replacement for losing weight its kinda all over
07-05-2020T23:18:35,AspiringNoodle,So we don't know if there's some kind of horrible side-effect if you keep it up long term
07-05-2020T23:18:36,SageSaga,and hard to stick to for many
07-05-2020T23:19:01,AspiringNoodle,Arterial hardening?  Cholesterol build-up?  We don't know!
07-05-2020T23:19:09,ZRO4825,@Nekonny You said you're doing these for patreon? What tier? I may need to resub. I had to drop you from my list a little while back due to some funding issues. :o
07-05-2020T23:19:25,SageSaga,actually we do know its generally not bad for your arteries
07-05-2020T23:19:33,AspiringNoodle,Well that's good :D
07-05-2020T23:20:22,SageSaga,the science behind clogging heart valves and such is pretty sound
07-05-2020T23:20:57,SageSaga,fat isnt bad for you - sugar is far worse - but everything is bad for you if you eat too much of it...
07-05-2020T23:21:13,Nekonny,Startig next month I'll be doing a poll to select a character for pinups

07-05-2020T23:21:17,AspiringNoodle,I would *love* if we started reducing sugar in foods
07-05-2020T23:21:29,AspiringNoodle,I'm trying Brisk to cut back

07-05-2020T23:21:46,Mihari,"Just don't overwork yourself, Ron."
07-05-2020T23:21:51,Nekonny,voting: $2 and above tier
07-05-2020T23:21:51,Combak,Yeah... We really should cut back on sugar.
07-05-2020T23:21:56,AspiringNoodle,"Zro, depends on how much sugar is in it"
07-05-2020T23:21:59,Mihari,You have a TON on your plate these days.
