13-05-2020T18:04:30,CrRAR,"We have a bbq place up the street with, like, a food truck catering trailer parked in a mostly empty lot near their restaurant. I was thinking they should do a tailgate style thing out there, it‚Äôd be amazing."

13-05-2020T18:14:02,Dadrobit,The whole place is maybe only as big as my living room. But their food is absolutely top notch.

13-05-2020T18:51:42,Dadrobit,The Thai place was another one my grandma introduced me too. Her tastes are almost always fantastic.
13-05-2020T20:44:19,CrRAR,Good brisket is rare to find. If sandwich gotta have swiss and horseradish.
