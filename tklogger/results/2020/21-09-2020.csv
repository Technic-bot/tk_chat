21-09-2020T06:56:26,CrimsonQuill,I think that this particular subject alongside mathematics will be the hardest to learn...
21-09-2020T06:56:48,CrimsonQuill,On break between my first 'lecture' and my second one...which is a practical class from 2pm

21-09-2020T10:05:24,CrimsonQuill,It's gonna be a bumpy ride this year.
21-09-2020T10:17:28,TerraTheWizard,so i visited a site tat i don't think has had much major redesign since it opened in 1998
21-09-2020T10:17:43,TerraTheWizard,and it's just 12px text on a solid white bg
21-09-2020T10:17:54,TerraTheWizard,"and that kills your eyes after a while,"
21-09-2020T10:18:19,TerraTheWizard,so i had to commit sins against web design and put some inline css in because :ctwokinds-flomad:
21-09-2020T10:18:30,CrimsonQuill,What's inline css?
21-09-2020T10:19:01,TerraTheWizard,normally you put css in a seperate file and link it (css is the stuff that makes the page look nice)
21-09-2020T10:19:14,TerraTheWizard,inline is when you put it in the main page body tag
21-09-2020T10:19:30,TerraTheWizard,which is a big no-no
21-09-2020T10:19:51,TerraTheWizard,because to edit it you need to edit the page source
21-09-2020T10:22:11,CrimsonQuill,So you changed the website?

21-09-2020T10:22:48,TerraTheWizard,i just did inspect element and put this in the body tag
21-09-2020T10:22:51,TerraTheWizard,"style=""background-color:#555555;color:#eeeeee;font-size:16px"""
21-09-2020T10:23:02,CrimsonQuill,Every site should have a dark theme.
21-09-2020T10:23:14,TerraTheWizard,"makes the bg grey, and text not-quite white"
21-09-2020T10:23:48,CrimsonQuill,Nice.
21-09-2020T12:07:21,TerraTheWizard,one of the quirks i find funny about people writing dialogue
21-09-2020T12:07:37,TerraTheWizard,when there's an exclaimation mark at the end of a whispered statement
21-09-2020T12:19:38,CrRAR,I may have discovered one of the secrets to big mac sauce.
21-09-2020T12:19:43,CrRAR,I got these spicy dill chips randomly for lunch and hell if they don't have the same kinda tang.
21-09-2020T12:20:14,CrRAR,I'm convinced dill/dill weed has to be one of the ingredients.

21-09-2020T19:46:22,SpazztasticKiwi,it would be more likely that time would get it anyway - mark doesn‚Äôt do conventions anymore
21-09-2020T19:46:58,SpazztasticKiwi,the man sells the cheese in bundle deals so you can get one of each flavor
21-09-2020T19:47:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember it was $35ish for 3 blocks
21-09-2020T19:47:23,SpazztasticKiwi,or $25
21-09-2020T19:47:46,CrRAR,"True test of honor, give both to tom, if Mark does a vidya about the delicious fan-supplied cheese you will know he tendered the goods."

21-09-2020T20:11:36,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-LauraCry:
21-09-2020T20:11:39,SpazztasticKiwi,for all I know he could make certain cheeses every other year
21-09-2020T20:12:07,SpazztasticKiwi,people like him are often venders from other parts
21-09-2020T20:12:10,CrRAR,I suddenly want coffee
21-09-2020T20:12:15,SpazztasticKiwi,or states
21-09-2020T20:12:55,CrRAR,I could have hot chocolate
21-09-2020T20:13:09,CrRAR,Hot chocolate mocha coffee?
21-09-2020T20:13:13,CrRAR,:thinking:
21-09-2020T20:13:27,CrRAR,Maybe just coffee
21-09-2020T20:15:33,SpazztasticKiwi,oh and the cajun shops are always open then and right in town where it happens
21-09-2020T20:15:33,CrRAR,I was just saying there should be a fruit van that brings fresh fruits in bulk to people
21-09-2020T20:15:44,CrRAR,Maybe it could also stock cheeses?
21-09-2020T20:16:32,CrRAR,They kinda do have such a thing though that‚Äôs what being in a farm-co-op share pretty much is
21-09-2020T20:16:32,SpazztasticKiwi,you know what misfits market is

21-09-2020T20:17:35,SpazztasticKiwi,though I guess there is a truck taking it to all the subscribers
21-09-2020T20:17:53,SpazztasticKiwi,but it‚Äôs not a farmers market on wheels exactly
21-09-2020T20:18:24,CrRAR,It‚Äôs the astectically special fruits and veggies
21-09-2020T20:18:46,CrRAR,Like freaky carrots and such
21-09-2020T20:20:23,SpazztasticKiwi,derp fruits
21-09-2020T20:20:47,SpazztasticKiwi,it looks like they have a limburger cheese

21-09-2020T20:21:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Marks mentioned once their dad ate that kind from a certain brand that got discontinued

21-09-2020T20:23:00,SpazztasticKiwi,he did do a taste test of some once that he said was about the same
21-09-2020T20:23:28,SpazztasticKiwi,but I‚Äôll stick to the bacon cheddar for him
21-09-2020T20:23:50,Ordithus,limburger isn't exactly popular
