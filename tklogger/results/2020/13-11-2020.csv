13-11-2020T03:11:31,SageSaga,the group is level 18 so Goblins might be a bit low for them-
13-11-2020T03:11:41,Roughlandin,Bugbears then
13-11-2020T03:11:44,unsteddyphoenix,500 goblins

13-11-2020T03:11:55,Ordithus,aren't they practically level 38?
13-11-2020T03:12:05,w0lfmare,Night Sage night everyone o/
13-11-2020T03:12:13,SageSaga,effective levels are closer to 26
13-11-2020T03:12:18,Ordithus,ah
13-11-2020T03:12:50,Roughlandin,Or maybe a Tarrasque
13-11-2020T03:12:57,SageSaga,"Mihari is a Dragon, Silver is a Demi God, Tom is a Guarded Spirit"
13-11-2020T03:13:06,Ordithus,"When ancient dragons are the ""mob"""
13-11-2020T03:13:20,Roughlandin,...Dang a Tarrasque might be too easy
13-11-2020T03:13:52,SageSaga,They will be fighting Gods eventually
13-11-2020T03:13:56,SageSaga,later!
13-11-2020T03:13:59,Ordithus,see ya!
13-11-2020T03:14:00,Roughlandin,Night!
13-11-2020T03:14:10,FenceEqualizer,Night Sage!
13-11-2020T03:14:24,Ordithus,"everything ended at once, crazy"
13-11-2020T03:14:33,Roughlandin,Yeah it's weird
13-11-2020T03:14:55,unsteddyphoenix,"I thought Tom was like, a druid"
13-11-2020T03:14:57,Roughlandin,"I'm surprised Mark didn't have an after-stream on one of his channels. Though I guess it was ""the end"""
13-11-2020T03:15:10,Ordithus,he just streamed for 12 hours
13-11-2020T03:15:19,Roughlandin,Yeah true
13-11-2020T03:15:31,Ordithus,and the channels are separate
13-11-2020T03:15:38,Ordithus,let it go~
13-11-2020T03:15:49,Roughlandin,But I can't hold it back anymore!
13-11-2020T03:16:53,Roughlandin,Idk I thought they'd at least have a hooray at the end. Though I guess the Sopranos cut to black kinda fit the channel's theme
13-11-2020T03:17:54,Roughlandin,Anyway it's past 3AM. This bear needs to hybernate. Night Ord! See ya Sunday!
13-11-2020T03:17:56,Roughlandin,o/
13-11-2020T03:18:02,Ordithus,night
13-11-2020T03:18:19,FenceEqualizer,O/ Night
13-11-2020T03:42:59,SpazztasticKiwi,with how he’s described the filming and editing I expect him to go comatose for a week
13-11-2020T03:43:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Ethan and Amy and all the editors and crew too
13-11-2020T04:04:01,SpazztasticKiwi,🛌

13-11-2020T15:01:52,BadFoMo,Yo.
13-11-2020T15:02:03,SageSaga,yo
13-11-2020T15:02:31,Ordithus,afternoon!
13-11-2020T15:02:45,AspiringNoodle,hi :D
13-11-2020T15:05:04,AspiringNoodle,Everyone enjoying the covid spikes? :snake:
13-11-2020T15:06:54,SageSaga,ehhh
13-11-2020T15:07:05,Ordithus,I basically leave my house for groceries and that's it
13-11-2020T15:07:13,SageSaga,could probably be better without em tbh
13-11-2020T15:08:10,AspiringNoodle,I *just* looked at yesterday's numbers and jfc 'Murica wtf are you doing?!?
13-11-2020T15:09:35,AspiringNoodle,"Nov 10th - 13th: 139,746 -> 142,860 -> 163,402 -> 181,194"
13-11-2020T15:09:54,SageSaga,it's important to point out the numbers are a couple weeks behind due to incubation periods
13-11-2020T15:10:25,AspiringNoodle,This is true.  New cases can emerge anywhere 1 - 14 days after exposure
13-11-2020T15:10:34,SageSaga,but the answer is - not wearing masks apparently
13-11-2020T15:11:30,AspiringNoodle,"In a matter of 3 weeks, my state's daily cases have tripled..."
13-11-2020T15:11:38,Ordithus,As of yesterday my state has implemented some more restrictions again. I don't think it's enough but it's better than nothing
13-11-2020T15:11:54,SageSaga,isnt this music pretty?
13-11-2020T15:12:05,AspiringNoodle,Very~
13-11-2020T15:12:21,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce: it is. nibs needs a slow dance
13-11-2020T15:12:22,SageSaga,crazy good for a mobile game- eh?
13-11-2020T15:12:30,AspiringNoodle,This is from a mobile game???
13-11-2020T15:12:37,AspiringNoodle,NAME PLZ
13-11-2020T15:12:44,Ordithus,"it's there, noodle"
13-11-2020T15:12:48,Ordithus,genshin impact
13-11-2020T15:12:48,SageSaga,Genshin Impact
13-11-2020T15:12:54,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, there it is, at the top, lol"
13-11-2020T15:13:00,AspiringNoodle,I shouldn't be surprised :P
13-11-2020T15:13:31,SageSaga,is good game- just dont spend money on it at all- or at least dont buy gems
13-11-2020T15:13:52,SageSaga,the wish rates for the gacha system are insane and you can earn free rolls
13-11-2020T15:14:21,AspiringNoodle,"Well, if it's a FTP game, I should spend money *somewhere* if I plan on playing long term"
13-11-2020T15:14:40,SageSaga,yeah- just not on gems
13-11-2020T15:14:56,SageSaga,average cost of a 5 Star Character is 250USD
13-11-2020T15:15:17,Hogan,Eveninges!
13-11-2020T15:15:23,AspiringNoodle,good lord O_O
13-11-2020T15:15:26,AspiringNoodle,Hi Hogan
13-11-2020T15:15:31,Ordithus,hi hogan
13-11-2020T15:15:34,SageSaga,its casino rates
13-11-2020T15:15:49,Hogan,"Hi Noodle, hi Ordithus!"
13-11-2020T15:16:05,AspiringNoodle,"Ngl, I'm still kinda bummed I never spent money on Apex Legends, haha"
13-11-2020T15:16:22,AspiringNoodle,But... I just can't get behind battle passes
13-11-2020T15:16:48,Hogan,"Meh, I had that problem when Destiny started messing with their Season passes..."
13-11-2020T15:17:08,AspiringNoodle,Not familiar with Destiny's system
13-11-2020T15:17:36,AspiringNoodle,"But battle passes, at their core, are you paying for the ability to earn limited time rewards.  But if you don't earn them, oh well, thanks for the money!"
13-11-2020T15:17:41,Hogan,"I thought I was, until they changed it, and I found out I was not..."
13-11-2020T15:18:39,Tatsuchan,hallo everyone
13-11-2020T15:18:42,AspiringNoodle,hallo <3
13-11-2020T15:18:43,Hogan,"About the same with the Season passes, you buy one and get access to that season's content, but it expire at the end of the season, so if you haven't completed it, its your loss"
13-11-2020T15:18:52,Hogan,Hello Tatsuchan
13-11-2020T15:19:42,Tatsuchan,"hoi hoi! ooh, Destiny! I can't say I've played it myself, but I do like the graphics"
13-11-2020T15:19:53,AspiringNoodle,"It's crazy... the more I find games trying to twist your arm into playing them, the more I'm turned off..."
13-11-2020T15:19:59,SageSaga,"in Genshin Impact the Battlepass has a free version, an extra set of rewards if you pay, and you can pay for a +10 boost to the level- and can spend gems to level too- so its a decent mix but still- you can sink money in it hard XD"
13-11-2020T15:20:19,AspiringNoodle,"Like, Apex Legends has some *amazing* cosmetics, but so many of them were tied to the battle pass."
13-11-2020T15:20:29,Hogan,"Destiny was more or less the only game I played for years, until they change the seasons and made expiring content"
13-11-2020T15:21:00,Hogan,"I play too little to be able to take full advantage of it, and without season pass there's not enough new to keep me going"
13-11-2020T15:21:32,AspiringNoodle,The game's industry has hit a dark place for sure
13-11-2020T15:21:42,Hogan,"I'm a lousy customer, once I've bought a game I ""never"" spend money on it..."
13-11-2020T15:21:55,AspiringNoodle,"Imo, if you pay for a pass, you should be able to finish it, period."
13-11-2020T15:22:13,AspiringNoodle,The fact that they time gate something you BUY is a hard pass from me
13-11-2020T15:22:14,Hogan,"A misguided belief that everything you earn should be achieved through the game, not by throwing extra money at it..."
13-11-2020T15:22:23,Tatsuchan,"it sounds weird, but I much prefer to have physical games and not really digital....I'm not much of an online player unfortunately"
13-11-2020T15:22:50,Ordithus,my issue has been how easy it is to buy games I want to play on Steam/Switch. Then be really lazy about going and playing them
13-11-2020T15:23:01,Hogan,"Agreed Noodle, and with the DLC there came out this week they REMOVED a lot of the original content... in the game I paid for..."
13-11-2020T15:24:25,Tatsuchan,I wish more unlockables were earned instead of bought....I'm a bit old school in that regard
13-11-2020T15:25:15,SpazztasticKiwi,🦉
13-11-2020T15:25:41,Hogan,"I dont mind micropayments and similar if its just cosmetics and similar, but once you start paying for upgrades that gives you an advantage gamingvise against others, I'm out..."
13-11-2020T15:26:14,Ordithus,yo spazz
13-11-2020T15:26:25,Hogan,"I remember playing the online game of Travian years ago, and at one point I was around at reset where everyone started all over"
13-11-2020T15:26:33,Tatsuchan,hallo SpazztasticKiwi
13-11-2020T15:27:00,Hogan,After three days of play I had my stockade up around my village and had a decent set of soldiers and I was satisfied with my progress
13-11-2020T15:27:34,Tatsuchan,"that is true, Hogan"
13-11-2020T15:27:40,Hogan,"... then I looked around and found a player who already had three towns, almost fully updgraded, and was already sending full armies out to trash any player who dared starting up close to him..."
13-11-2020T15:28:03,Hogan,.. guess who just sunk a whole bunch of monnies into fast upgrades and diamonds...
13-11-2020T15:28:12,Hogan,Hey Spazz!
13-11-2020T15:28:18,Ordithus,:csagesaga-kaylinheart: Kaylin cute as always
13-11-2020T15:28:24,Tatsuchan,that...makes it less fun imo....challenges are part of the fun
13-11-2020T15:28:46,Tatsuchan,"looking good, SegeSaga!"
13-11-2020T15:28:56,Tatsuchan,*SageSaga
13-11-2020T15:29:34,Hogan,Agreed... on both accounts :-)
13-11-2020T15:29:49,Hogan,"I like working my way up, but it should be equal playing field"
13-11-2020T15:29:50,SageSaga,wat
13-11-2020T15:30:04,SageSaga,what makes it less fun?
13-11-2020T15:31:20,Hogan,When you can buy you out of challenges or to serious advantages over others in the game?
13-11-2020T15:31:21,Tatsuchan,"ooh, being able to instantly upgrade without any challenges to build up. working your way through the game is better than instantly or easily defeating others....to me at least"
13-11-2020T15:32:52,AspiringNoodle,Battlefront nearly DIED over the gambling pay-to-win nature of the game
13-11-2020T15:32:53,SageSaga,the buying mechanic includes using in game currency that you earn- so its for people who dont have time to finish something before a deadline if they cant complete all the tasks due to - you know- life
13-11-2020T15:32:56,AspiringNoodle,Battlefront 2*
13-11-2020T15:33:36,SageSaga,its also optional to spend money so it doesnt take anything from it if you can
13-11-2020T15:34:09,AspiringNoodle,Sounds like Genshin Impact nailed a good balance between its FTP and Microtransactions
13-11-2020T15:34:21,Hogan,"I dont belittle people spending money to catch up or, as you mention, to finish something off, but when you can use them to get majorly ahead..."
13-11-2020T15:34:28,AspiringNoodle,Too many games are egregiously greedy and make the game such a slog without throwing money at it
13-11-2020T15:34:50,AspiringNoodle,Y'all hear about that Harry Potter mobile game?
13-11-2020T15:35:10,Tatsuchan,using them to get majorly ahead is my biggest issue...it's something I see a lot of nowadays
13-11-2020T15:35:25,Tatsuchan,"i heard of it, but nothing other than that"
13-11-2020T15:35:27,SageSaga,but it doesnt get you ahead
13-11-2020T15:35:39,SageSaga,it gives you less to do in the game
13-11-2020T15:35:57,Ordithus,"pay to win is blegh, pay to save time seems alright, as long as it's an optional thing. think I'm agreeing with y'all"
13-11-2020T15:35:57,SageSaga,you still need to wait a month for the next battlepass
13-11-2020T15:36:04,AspiringNoodle,"Soooo, the most recent Harry Potter mobile game was decently well made"
13-11-2020T15:36:15,AspiringNoodle,"Good graphics, gives you the Hogwards experience"
13-11-2020T15:36:23,Hogan,"I'm not familiar with you game Sage, but in the ones I've played, getting ahead meant you could have fun trashing other players at your leisure..."
13-11-2020T15:36:28,AspiringNoodle,UNTIL you reach the bloody Devil's Snare...
13-11-2020T15:36:41,SageSaga,you are getting it sooner- sure- but the benefit of getting it early isnt a big deal
13-11-2020T15:36:57,SageSaga,. . . its not a PVP game
13-11-2020T15:36:59,AspiringNoodle,The game was really well paced before that point.  Decent progress with the occassional small break
13-11-2020T15:37:05,SageSaga,its mostly single player and co-op
13-11-2020T15:37:15,Hogan,The it sounds like that game is more balanced Sage :-)
13-11-2020T15:37:21,AspiringNoodle,"And then they literally strangle your child in a major timegate that more or less strongly ""encourages"" you to buy stuff"
13-11-2020T15:37:26,Hogan,Because the paywall ruins it in PvP-based games
13-11-2020T15:38:06,Tatsuchan,dang...
13-11-2020T15:38:08,SageSaga,the games Resin system is close to a time gate system
13-11-2020T15:38:22,SageSaga,but while it could use some work its not a big deal
13-11-2020T15:38:34,SageSaga,it limits how many world bosses you can get drops from and such
13-11-2020T15:38:54,Hogan,"In Travian it was double bad, because being attacked by a superior cashwhore player axctually destroyed your build achievements in your town"
13-11-2020T15:38:57,AspiringNoodle,Harry Potter Hogwarts Mystery Strangles Your Child Avatar Until You Pay Money or Wait: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umUD1rwUaH4&list=PLax6t6acevkwQFo2ynukEQVEOn7-K7QL0
13-11-2020T15:39:14,Hogan,At one point I was set back two months of playing until I had rebuild everything after such an attack
13-11-2020T15:39:21,AspiringNoodle,"Not an exagerration, either, lol.  Apparently this part of the game was very time consuming"
13-11-2020T15:39:27,Hogan,"... again a ""gentle pressure"" on you to spend money rebuilding..."
13-11-2020T15:40:28,SageSaga,its how they made 3 million dollars in a single day...
13-11-2020T15:40:33,Hogan,... I'm actually glad I missed out on that game XD
13-11-2020T15:40:48,AspiringNoodle,"Funnily enough, that situation is a perfect personification of mobile games in general"
13-11-2020T15:41:16,Ordithus,I don't think personification is the word you are looking for
13-11-2020T15:41:22,AspiringNoodle,"""PAY US TO ENJOY YOUR GAME.  What's a little bit of money if it means you have more fun?"" :snail:"
13-11-2020T15:41:33,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, you're right..."
13-11-2020T15:41:41,AspiringNoodle,Embodiment?
13-11-2020T15:41:47,Ordithus,Better at least
13-11-2020T15:42:11,Hogan,I got the patience of a saint! XD
13-11-2020T15:42:16,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, yeah, embodiment"
13-11-2020T15:42:17,AspiringNoodle,"""a tangible or visible form of an idea, quality, or feeling."""
13-11-2020T15:42:18,Hogan,I can wait for most things
13-11-2020T15:45:10,Hogan,Which game was it you were talking about Sage? I missed the beginning of the conversation?
13-11-2020T15:49:05,Ordithus,I believe it was Genshin Impact

13-11-2020T16:24:25,SageSaga,last Barbarian I played - made the DM cry
13-11-2020T16:25:07,Ordithus,haha what
13-11-2020T16:26:41,SageSaga,yeah he gave me a magical lute and didnt tell me what it did- so i started playing it and it caused a bunch of forest animals to be friendly- so i kept playing so a deer would get closer and closer-
13-11-2020T16:26:59,SageSaga,and then i dropped the lute- grabbed the deer by the horns and snapped its neck
13-11-2020T16:27:07,SageSaga,"and said ""MEAT!"""

13-11-2020T16:27:36,Ordithus,but yay meat :ctwokinds-natsducky:
13-11-2020T16:28:50,AspiringNoodle,"Sage, you are horrible :ptv-shock:"
13-11-2020T16:29:12,SageSaga,how so?
13-11-2020T16:29:20,AspiringNoodle,That poor deer :ptv-whiny:
13-11-2020T16:29:53,SageSaga,it was delicious
13-11-2020T16:30:29,AspiringNoodle,;-;
13-11-2020T16:30:46,TeapotOfDoom,hi sage
13-11-2020T16:30:49,TeapotOfDoom,how could you
13-11-2020T16:30:51,SageSaga,yo
13-11-2020T16:31:07,Ordithus,ello teapot
13-11-2020T16:31:10,TeapotOfDoom,hi ord
13-11-2020T16:31:15,TeapotOfDoom,dnd shenanigans?
13-11-2020T16:31:23,Ordithus,yee
13-11-2020T16:31:33,TeapotOfDoom,nice sign me up
13-11-2020T16:31:37,SageSaga,look- if your DM wants to remind you every time you eat rations that they are bland and or dry- and you have the ability to hunt and gather- why wouldnt you kill a deer for food?
13-11-2020T16:31:58,TeapotOfDoom,fair enough
13-11-2020T16:32:09,TeapotOfDoom,pretty smart yet very cruel
13-11-2020T16:32:15,Ordithus,the method is a bit unorthodox but effective
13-11-2020T16:32:17,SageSaga,how is it cruel?!
13-11-2020T16:32:38,SageSaga,if you are a meat eater- if you are not vegan- then you should not have a problem with this
13-11-2020T16:32:40,TeapotOfDoom,i tried to reason with a deer once to try and convince him to replace one of our dead horses
13-11-2020T16:32:55,CheddarCat,hey folks
13-11-2020T16:33:04,Ordithus,hi cheddar
13-11-2020T16:33:09,TeapotOfDoom,he wasn't very into the idea so my comanions just captured him anyway
13-11-2020T16:33:17,AspiringNoodle,But... but... you MURDER deer friend
13-11-2020T16:33:20,TeapotOfDoom,i felt bad for that poor thing
13-11-2020T16:33:26,Ordithus,sage as punishment you need to befriend a cute forest critter
13-11-2020T16:33:28,AspiringNoodle,It wanted to be fwiend ;-;
13-11-2020T16:33:44,TeapotOfDoom,the duality of man
13-11-2020T16:33:57,TeapotOfDoom,poor deer friend / mmm good food
13-11-2020T16:34:29,SageSaga,why would i want to be friends with food?
13-11-2020T16:34:42,Ordithus,for safekeeping
13-11-2020T16:34:47,AspiringNoodle,You could kill another deer
13-11-2020T16:34:47,TeapotOfDoom,^
13-11-2020T16:34:47,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-daydreamingkat:
13-11-2020T16:34:52,TeapotOfDoom,fish are friends not food
13-11-2020T16:34:54,AspiringNoodle,Just not that one.  That one wanted to be friends ;-;
13-11-2020T16:35:04,SageSaga,what makes you think i was friends with this deer?
13-11-2020T16:35:11,AspiringNoodle,You monster...
13-11-2020T16:35:14,TeapotOfDoom,my arrow was on sage xD
13-11-2020T16:35:19,SageSaga,it was magically enchanted to come to me- it wasnt like it wanted to be friends
13-11-2020T16:35:43,TeapotOfDoom,at least it had a quick end
13-11-2020T16:35:53,AspiringNoodle,You didn't even try T_T
13-11-2020T16:36:32,SageSaga,i dont want to be friends with some weak deer that cant even defend itself
13-11-2020T16:38:17,Ordithus,so was that the only time you used that lute?
13-11-2020T16:38:34,SageSaga,of course not
13-11-2020T16:38:43,SageSaga,it makes hunting easier
13-11-2020T16:38:51,SageSaga,its my hunting lute
13-11-2020T16:38:55,Ordithus,:meat_on_bone::csagesaga-nynasmirk:
13-11-2020T16:39:00,Ordithus,haha
13-11-2020T16:39:02,Ordithus,amazing
13-11-2020T16:39:05,SageSaga,i was a dwarven barbarian
13-11-2020T16:39:11,TeapotOfDoom,that poor dm xD
13-11-2020T16:39:39,AspiringNoodle,"He's biding his time, plotting his revenge"
13-11-2020T16:39:52,TeapotOfDoom,probably :cteapotofdoom-kumipog:
13-11-2020T16:39:59,SageSaga,Muscle wizard was a better character though imo
13-11-2020T16:40:02,AspiringNoodle,Just waiting for a stupidly powerful beast to be nearby when the lute is used >:)
13-11-2020T16:40:53,SageSaga,there are no stupidly powerful beasts
13-11-2020T16:40:53,Ordithus,Then at least it will be friendly
13-11-2020T16:41:25,AspiringNoodle,curses
13-11-2020T16:42:12,SageSaga,once a beast becomes stupidly powerful it becomes a monstrosity - which makes it not affected by things that only work on beasts/animals
13-11-2020T16:42:18,TeapotOfDoom,have you had a look at tasha's sage?
13-11-2020T16:42:32,SageSaga,its not out yet right?
13-11-2020T16:42:36,SageSaga,comes out next week?
13-11-2020T16:42:39,TeapotOfDoom,not sure
13-11-2020T16:42:49,TeapotOfDoom,i saw the contents and whooo boi
13-11-2020T16:43:16,TeapotOfDoom,they're doing party patreons
13-11-2020T16:43:26,TeapotOfDoom,complete revamp of how races work
13-11-2020T16:43:28,Ordithus,the 17th looks like
13-11-2020T16:44:12,SageSaga,that is next week-
13-11-2020T16:45:09,AspiringNoodle,Note for the DM: Find a way to make the lute affect monstrosities
13-11-2020T16:45:14,AspiringNoodle,DEER FRIEND MUST BE AVENGED
13-11-2020T16:45:31,SageSaga,that game is long since over
13-11-2020T16:45:44,TeapotOfDoom,oh that was in the past
13-11-2020T16:45:54,SageSaga,Dwarven Barbarian never found a deer to call friend- only food
13-11-2020T16:46:06,Ordithus,not that he tried
13-11-2020T16:46:17,TeapotOfDoom,lol
13-11-2020T16:46:36,SageSaga,Muscle Wizard killed a Red Dragon with a staff though
13-11-2020T16:48:50,TeapotOfDoom,and video killed the radio star
13-11-2020T16:48:58,TeapotOfDoom,:cteapotofdoom-w0lfflo:
13-11-2020T16:49:27,SageSaga,"Muscle Wizard gets arrested - ""Cuff him"" Muscle Wizard - ""I can break these cuffs!"" ""You cant break those cuffs"" ""RAAAHHH! *SNAP*"" ""HE BROKE THE CUFFS!"""
13-11-2020T16:49:49,TeapotOfDoom,Oh no! :ptv-shock:
13-11-2020T16:50:21,Ordithus,haha we're dead :csagesaga-c1:
13-11-2020T16:51:45,SageSaga,when he killed the dragon though he actually used his spell catapult on his staff and flung it through the dragons neck killing it- but destroying his staff in the process
13-11-2020T16:52:32,SageSaga,"the Cleric was like ""That was awesome but how are you going to cast magic without your staff?"" and i was like ""I always keep a backup focus"" as i pulled out a my crystal necklace"
13-11-2020T16:52:39,Ordithus,points for style
13-11-2020T16:52:42,Ordithus,and preparation
13-11-2020T16:52:56,SageSaga,brains and Brawn

13-11-2020T16:53:28,TeapotOfDoom,holy shit
13-11-2020T16:53:52,SageSaga,originally he was the strongest in the party with a 14 strength-
13-11-2020T16:53:59,AspiringNoodle,"""I'ma punch your face... WITH MAGIC!!!"""
13-11-2020T16:54:01,Ordithus,"this barbarian - we're making level 7 characters for a oneoff dungeon, random stats. rolled 13, 13, 18, 15, 15, and 10. As a Hill Dwarf he'll have 20 CON to start with"
13-11-2020T16:54:07,Ordithus,Absurdly lucky rolls
13-11-2020T16:54:15,SageSaga,but then he got possessed by a Froghemoth demigod that set his Str to 23
13-11-2020T16:54:16,Ordithus,Imma be reckless with this guy
13-11-2020T16:54:46,AspiringNoodle,"Haha, your wizard casts arcane missile, but just punches their face xD"
13-11-2020T16:55:16,TeapotOfDoom,holy moly ord
13-11-2020T16:55:16,SageSaga,we got in a fight with 3 hags and i just started wrestling them
13-11-2020T16:55:24,Ordithus,lol
13-11-2020T16:55:31,SageSaga,it DESTROYED their action economy
13-11-2020T16:55:54,SageSaga,it was supposed to be a VERY deadly fight- and i trivialized it
13-11-2020T16:55:57,TeapotOfDoom,the magic missle is just a flying fist with a rocked motor coming out of the wrist
13-11-2020T16:56:17,TeapotOfDoom,supplex the hags
13-11-2020T16:56:34,Ordithus,they weren't expecting hugs
13-11-2020T16:56:46,TeapotOfDoom,hug a hag. hag hug
13-11-2020T16:58:18,TeapotOfDoom,alright got an artist meeting coming up for a not so small project
