10-02-2020T18:05:39,JojoF2415,Markers
10-02-2020T18:06:19,tehbear,i recently got myself a couple of whiteboards and whiteboard markers
10-02-2020T18:06:44,JojoF2415,Mines are alcohol based
10-02-2020T18:14:19,tehbear,"i like drawing big, so i find sketching on a whiteboard easier than on a4 paper"
10-02-2020T18:14:41,CrimsonQuill,I'm trying to get the hang of colouring pencils
10-02-2020T18:14:56,tehbear,"also, ability to erase parts easily is nice. not quite the same with an eraser on paper."
10-02-2020T18:15:02,CrimsonQuill,Well
10-02-2020T18:15:12,CrimsonQuill,Paper is more permanent
10-02-2020T18:15:23,CrimsonQuill,"Plus, I just do better that way"
10-02-2020T18:16:30,tehbear,i suppose real artists use light strokes with a pencil on paper
10-02-2020T18:16:44,CrimsonQuill,Still gettting the hang of that
10-02-2020T18:16:50,CrimsonQuill,Sometimes i press too hard
10-02-2020T18:17:29,tehbear,painers use coals for some reason
10-02-2020T18:17:45,CrimsonQuill,I think coal tar might be a thing
10-02-2020T18:17:59,tehbear,painters*. before they apply oil paint... well. some go direct to painting too
10-02-2020T18:19:11,CrimsonQuill,I wonder what to draw next now..
