26-09-2020T15:20:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Best way to learn line art is really to do a lot of it

26-09-2020T15:56:40,TobyTTobes,The clouds are incredible btw!

26-09-2020T20:38:51,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe
26-09-2020T20:38:59,SpazztasticKiwi,or a joke print
26-09-2020T20:39:15,Ordithus,alabaster
26-09-2020T20:39:17,SpazztasticKiwi,closed door with quarantine tape all over it
26-09-2020T20:39:56,SpazztasticKiwi,a rose one would be nice tho
26-09-2020T20:40:10,SpazztasticKiwi,the zombie look would fit the year even if it’s a joke
26-09-2020T20:42:14,SpazztasticKiwi,or it could be Nibblys time to shine
26-09-2020T20:42:54,Dadrobit,"Dang, seems I missed the stream."
26-09-2020T20:43:12,Ordithus,hi dadro you did
26-09-2020T20:43:17,Dadrobit,Did #QualityUndercoverMaddie make the color cut does anyone know?
26-09-2020T20:43:37,Ordithus,my brain fails me
26-09-2020T20:43:38,SpazztasticKiwi,didn’t see it
26-09-2020T20:43:43,KeefMcDerpface,"Sadly, no."
26-09-2020T20:43:54,SpazztasticKiwi,the sisters one did so I’m good
26-09-2020T20:44:00,Dadrobit,"RIP, had moderate to high hopes."
26-09-2020T20:44:05,KeefMcDerpface,But it made the runner ups.
26-09-2020T20:44:18,Dadrobit,:0 So close
26-09-2020T20:44:22,Ordithus,ah it was the other maddie sketch that made #5
26-09-2020T20:44:47,KeefMcDerpface,"Yeah, Maddie and Maeve at the cafe."
26-09-2020T20:45:33,Ordithus,spazz this could be the 2020 print https://www.ocbin.com/post/166/
26-09-2020T20:46:25,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-ohmy: Nibbly...!
26-09-2020T20:47:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean I guess
26-09-2020T20:47:09,SpazztasticKiwi,but talk to Tom
26-09-2020T20:47:27,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s head of the department in that regard
26-09-2020T20:47:45,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floraquestion: wait you aren't Tom
26-09-2020T20:47:57,SpazztasticKiwi,#youthink
26-09-2020T20:48:04,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floAAA:
26-09-2020T20:48:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d love for someone to mistake me for Tom
26-09-2020T20:48:20,SpazztasticKiwi,art thou blind
26-09-2020T20:48:52,BlackjackSec99,... I missed the stream.... :ctwokinds-LauraCry:
26-09-2020T20:49:01,KeefMcDerpface,yep
26-09-2020T20:51:57,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-kingtea:
26-09-2020T20:53:48,SpazztasticKiwi,oh I apparently got a date tomorrow
26-09-2020T20:54:16,Ordithus,have fun!
26-09-2020T20:54:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I will not
26-09-2020T20:54:38,Ordithus,break a leg!
26-09-2020T20:54:54,SpazztasticKiwi,only if you go to work for me after
26-09-2020T20:55:00,SpazztasticKiwi,and I will not
26-09-2020T20:55:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I work tomorrow & bro says he’s gonna stop by to talk when he get s his dinner
26-09-2020T20:56:08,SpazztasticKiwi,ngl getting closer and closer I to stalker territory
26-09-2020T20:57:25,SpazztasticKiwi,or it’s just odd and I work at a common store
26-09-2020T20:58:02,SpazztasticKiwi,because friends swing by work now and then right
26-09-2020T20:58:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"anyway not real date, sarcasm but why does that Nibbly picture give off despacito vibes"
26-09-2020T20:59:47,BlackjackSec99,ehhhhhhh common places like department stores and food places are kinda normal to frequent... though an increased number of visits is worrying.
26-09-2020T21:01:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"he’s there to get groceries whenever anyway and I don’t always see him but as for these announced visits, that’s new"
26-09-2020T21:01:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"what am I gonna do, ban him from hanging around walmart"
26-09-2020T21:04:03,BlackjackSec99,its acutally a possibility if it get too much. store manager DOES have the ability to do that
26-09-2020T21:09:13,Dadrobit,:/ Some folks like having recognizable rapport with their local grocery store employees.
26-09-2020T21:09:21,Dadrobit,is one of those folks
26-09-2020T21:09:53,Dadrobit,I get mad discounts sometimes. Good stuff.
26-09-2020T21:11:36,SpazztasticKiwi,so far his interest has been mild but tolerable without being bothersome
26-09-2020T21:12:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"whether he still wants what he asked for so far ago is possible but unknown for sure but I’m young, not stupid"
26-09-2020T21:13:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I do have lines and if he wasn’t so skate them that’s his funeral
26-09-2020T21:14:11,SpazztasticKiwi,but anyhow walmart has a discount system - employees get a card after 6 months & partners (specifically defined as those in a committed relationship and NOT RELATED TO the employee)
26-09-2020T21:14:24,SpazztasticKiwi,can too
26-09-2020T21:14:46,CrRAR,phew
26-09-2020T21:14:48,SpazztasticKiwi,now they’ve been advertising a walmart+ thing membership
26-09-2020T21:15:07,AspiringNoodle,"Oh cool, Walmart employees get discount cards??"
26-09-2020T21:15:32,CrRAR,I just always figured Walmart+ was Target
26-09-2020T21:15:55,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s $12-14/month or $98/year
26-09-2020T21:16:09,CrRAR,Whheeee free delibery!
26-09-2020T21:16:17,CrRAR,:package::fog:
26-09-2020T21:16:45,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s something about unlimited free delivery  and pickup (pickup has always been free) and express pickup at stores or in line
26-09-2020T21:17:16,SpazztasticKiwi,which I feel like is fancy talk for “order online and we’ll gather your goodies so you can walk in and carry them out”
26-09-2020T21:17:32,SpazztasticKiwi,sooooooo..online shopping?
26-09-2020T21:18:08,CrRAR,ikr?
26-09-2020T21:18:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I can be lazy and antisocial but I can shop for myself
26-09-2020T21:19:05,CrRAR,“We’re just reinventing things you alreay can do and selling you a subscription for it”
26-09-2020T21:19:09,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s about the only time I’ll be social and physically shop
26-09-2020T21:19:33,SpazztasticKiwi,in a nutshell that’s basically hitting the nail on the head right there
26-09-2020T21:19:44,CrRAR,Yeah being in a store is like
26-09-2020T21:19:51,CrRAR,“I can buy ANYTHING”
26-09-2020T21:19:55,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-keith8D:
26-09-2020T21:20:10,SpazztasticKiwi,you theoretically can get groceries delivered but we don’t have that around here and I don’t want others touching my foodstuff
26-09-2020T21:20:23,CrRAR,true
26-09-2020T21:20:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"but a new bookshelf? send that sht to my front door, I’m not going anywhere"
26-09-2020T21:21:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I say that and I used pick up at store for my new bookshelf
26-09-2020T21:21:44,SpazztasticKiwi,it was free and I had to be there to go to work anyway
26-09-2020T21:22:01,CrRAR,Feels more fulfilling toting it around
26-09-2020T21:22:43,SpazztasticKiwi,it was a long box because the shelf came in wood planks
26-09-2020T21:23:11,CrRAR,big ol boards
26-09-2020T21:23:26,SpazztasticKiwi,under 100 pounds but have you ever tried moving something nonsentient around that’s as long as you
26-09-2020T21:23:47,CrRAR,Gotta do the surfboard method
26-09-2020T21:23:53,SpazztasticKiwi,and it’s in a buggy with wheels
26-09-2020T21:24:01,CrRAR,Over the head or under the arm
26-09-2020T21:24:15,CrRAR,Oh
26-09-2020T21:24:34,CrRAR,Challenge anyone to a good ol fashioned joust?
26-09-2020T21:25:42,SpazztasticKiwi,myself trying to pull the thing out while the buggy want to run the other way
26-09-2020T21:26:06,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s only a two person job because of that little monster called gravity
26-09-2020T21:26:15,CrRAR,"Buggy: “I’m done, I go home now”"
26-09-2020T21:26:46,CrRAR,Is the ‘buggy’ a carriage?
26-09-2020T21:27:06,CrRAR,Or like one of those rolly platforms w/ the handle?
26-09-2020T21:28:49,SpazztasticKiwi,shopping cart
26-09-2020T21:28:55,SpazztasticKiwi,they’re buggies
26-09-2020T21:29:04,SpazztasticKiwi,the uk call them trollies
26-09-2020T21:29:33,SpazztasticKiwi,if you don’t know what a buggy is you’d be lost in the south
26-09-2020T21:29:43,CrRAR,I just imagine anything ‘buggy’ having an engine. :|
26-09-2020T21:29:50,SpazztasticKiwi,we have names for things they don’t got in other parts of the country
26-09-2020T21:30:01,CrRAR,Like hoagie!
26-09-2020T21:30:07,CrRAR,Or pop!
26-09-2020T21:30:14,SpazztasticKiwi,and over half of us don’t enunciate
26-09-2020T21:30:38,CrRAR,Yeah I heard brad pitt in that movie that one time
26-09-2020T21:38:54,SpazztasticKiwi,jeff foxworthy
26-09-2020T21:38:56,AspiringNoodle,Just caught up on the convo
26-09-2020T21:39:07,SpazztasticKiwi,pitt is a actor
26-09-2020T21:39:10,AspiringNoodle,"Soooo, the perk is like super ""it exists"" level, right?"
26-09-2020T21:39:30,CrRAR,"Boomhauer, boomhauers everywhere"
26-09-2020T21:39:44,SpazztasticKiwi,if you want someone that actually has a southern lit to them you need foxworthy
26-09-2020T21:39:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I know Marks said he loves him
26-09-2020T21:40:33,SpazztasticKiwi,in fact he said that was one of the two things he’d download on his mp3 player
26-09-2020T21:40:41,SpazztasticKiwi,or ipod whatever it was
26-09-2020T21:41:15,SpazztasticKiwi,if he thinks that’s great stuff he should try out some actual south
26-09-2020T21:41:33,SpazztasticKiwi,it’d eat him alive
26-09-2020T21:41:44,CrRAR,"Foxworthy does have a ver warm, genial tone."
26-09-2020T21:42:44,AspiringNoodle,I am unfamiliar with this Foxworthy
26-09-2020T21:43:04,SpazztasticKiwi,google is wonderful this time of year I hear
26-09-2020T21:43:27,AspiringNoodle,"Indeed it is, and now I am *somewhat* familiar with this Foxworthy :D"
26-09-2020T21:45:01,CrRAR,Our Facilities guy in charge of all the building upkeep reminds me of him
26-09-2020T21:45:16,CrRAR,Good ol Dan
26-09-2020T21:45:38,SpazztasticKiwi,he made a very good point one time when he said it’s not the most intelligent sounding accent
26-09-2020T21:47:06,SpazztasticKiwi,like if you went for brain surgery and your surgeon came in like “well it’ll be nuthin fer us to git on in dere en take dat sucker right on out n y’all’ll be right as rain again”
