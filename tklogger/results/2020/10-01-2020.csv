10-01-2020T00:02:14,SageSaga,the last time i used Latin a bunch of people complained that my Italian was all wrong and i was a horrible person
10-01-2020T00:02:23,AspiringNoodle,HA

10-01-2020T00:04:22,BadFoMo,I think the only Latin I know is a butchering of what was said in Monty Python and the Holy Grail. And I know really know what I'm saying.
10-01-2020T00:04:28,ShamusTheFox,"Being called a horrible person on the internet is the equivalent of searching in your pocket and finding a penny. It doesn't happen every single time, but it's not shocking in the least when it does."

10-01-2020T00:38:09,BadFoMo,@Dadrobit Same. I play game to have fun; and dying/losing over and over again is not fun to me.
10-01-2020T00:38:51,SageSaga,some people say MHW has instadeath gameplay but it doesn't really- it just feels like it when  you dont realizes your armor has elemental resistances and weaknesses too...
10-01-2020T00:39:24,BadFoMo,That's also why my 'friend' NEVER plays PvP games.

10-01-2020T01:38:19,RimaDraws,dang
10-01-2020T01:38:28,Dadrobit,Sounded like bad communication on both ends between her and her lawyer. And the whole thing in general is messy as fuck.
10-01-2020T01:38:54,FloofyCat,I've gotten three days off work and its the first time I've had three days off straight for months

10-01-2020T01:39:57,Dadrobit,"Dude forced her to sell the house so he could get half of it. The catch? They bought the house from our parents and he barely paid anything. Legit less than 10k in the years he was ""paying""."

10-01-2020T01:43:47,Dadrobit,But he's a good Mormon with a good job that can afford a good lawyer now. So she's stuck in the shit.

10-01-2020T03:39:12,AspiringNoodle,I really like movies ^^;
10-01-2020T03:40:37,Dadrobit,Just saw Cats myself. Loved it. Think I mentioned that here before though.
10-01-2020T03:44:47,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, you loved the thing most people hate about it :P"
10-01-2020T03:44:52,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-snicker:
10-01-2020T03:48:19,Dadrobit,"I mean, a lot of people literally just don't get it."
10-01-2020T03:49:26,Dadrobit,Cats the movie is an artistic interpretation of the musical which itself is an artistic interpretation of the writer's daughter's nonsensical interpretation of a series of poems.
10-01-2020T03:50:00,Dadrobit,"The daughter being a small child. Hence the made up words like ""jellicle"""
10-01-2020T03:50:45,Dadrobit,"People are like, ""I don't get it"" and that's the point. You're not supposed to ""get it"""
10-01-2020T03:51:10,AspiringNoodle,"TBF, the problem is likely that the movie is meant to be for a niche audience"
10-01-2020T03:51:19,Dadrobit,"At least not anymore than you're supposed to understand ""snicker sick went the jabbawack"""
10-01-2020T03:51:20,AspiringNoodle,But they went after it with the budget of a blockbuster
10-01-2020T03:51:38,AspiringNoodle,Bigger budget !+ bigger audience
10-01-2020T03:51:42,AspiringNoodle,!=*
10-01-2020T03:52:04,AspiringNoodle,"Also, uncanny valley ruins it for me :P"
10-01-2020T03:52:11,Dadrobit,The movie is meant to be a musical. And the transition to the big screen using 3D animation was not kind.
10-01-2020T03:52:32,AspiringNoodle,Exactly :P
10-01-2020T03:52:38,AspiringNoodle,"Niche production given a big budget, lmao"
10-01-2020T03:52:48,AspiringNoodle,Niche is niche for a reason ;)
10-01-2020T03:54:26,Dadrobit,"I mean, the original Cats wasn't that niche. Shit brought in billions through its Broadway life."
10-01-2020T03:56:09,Dadrobit,"$2.8 billion dollars. 4th all time revenue behind Wicked, Phantom of the Opera, and Lion King."
10-01-2020T03:59:17,Dadrobit,"A $100 million budget is still only 3% of what the Broadway play brought in. People are mystified by the ""large"" budget, but that shit easily looks like a conservative bet against the potential gains of a movie that would still be profitable even if it"
10-01-2020T03:59:45,Dadrobit,Only turned out to be a tenth as possible as it's origin. Unlucky for them it was much worse.
10-01-2020T04:00:16,Dadrobit,Tenth as profitable*
10-01-2020T04:05:32,AspiringNoodle,And that's what I'm saying
10-01-2020T04:05:38,AspiringNoodle,It was profitable on broadway
10-01-2020T04:13:40,Dadrobit,And transitioning to movie should have absolutely been a safe bet. Musicals can do just fine there. The Sound of Music is still one of the top pulling movies out there with over $2 billion itself.
10-01-2020T04:15:20,Dadrobit,$2.5 billion in fact
10-01-2020T04:16:57,AspiringNoodle,"I'll be honest, it probably would've done fine, if they hadn't pulled the cgi bs"

10-01-2020T15:45:39,TeapotOfDoom,inner clock may be messed up
10-01-2020T15:49:22,Ordithus,"If not spoilers, how old is Callum's player?"
10-01-2020T15:50:26,SageSaga,10 irl but hes been in game for 2 years so mentally 12
10-01-2020T15:51:00,SageSaga,keep in mind he also has a future education and is smart boy
10-01-2020T15:52:01,Ordithus,Growing up so fast
10-01-2020T15:52:13,SageSaga,kinda has to
10-01-2020T15:52:58,SageSaga,hes always been mature for his age but his first 9 months in the game were pretty rough
10-01-2020T15:59:39,Ordithus,"He's an orphan for all practical purposes, yeah?"
10-01-2020T15:59:44,CrimsonQuill,Off to bed

10-01-2020T16:00:17,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s a truck in front of me with pink windshield wipers
10-01-2020T16:00:22,SageSaga,he has a guardian- as mentioned and implied by the talking when Kaylin broke in
10-01-2020T16:00:35,TeapotOfDoom,nice spazz
10-01-2020T16:00:54,SpazztasticKiwi,powder pink
10-01-2020T16:01:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"it’d be a good color for the whole truck, honestly"
10-01-2020T16:01:32,Ordithus,I guess what I meant is he was an orphan when the whole incident thing started
10-01-2020T16:01:32,SageSaga,This comic Callum will mention Henry a bit more
10-01-2020T16:02:20,SageSaga,technically only for about a week before he met Henry
10-01-2020T16:03:30,SageSaga,"Henry Identified him as a ""Magically Adept"" kid which is pretty rare - and Henry isnt the type to pass up an opportunity"
10-01-2020T16:03:59,TeapotOfDoom,"spazz have you ever seen linus' ""lambo""?"
10-01-2020T16:04:27,TeapotOfDoom,cause pink is an amazing color for a car xD
10-01-2020T16:04:41,TeapotOfDoom,here be the lambo: https://linustechtips.com/main/uploads/monthly_2016_12/LTT_Lambo.PNG.f3cb998c890344cf82ddc83338dffc63.PNG

10-01-2020T16:05:14,Ordithus,"... should we tell him, teapot?"
10-01-2020T16:05:31,SageSaga,"more like ""You have magical potential- I know a guy-"" ""Im actually a trained wizard"" ""Wait- what now?"""
10-01-2020T16:05:39,TeapotOfDoom,(that it's not a lambo?)

10-01-2020T16:05:58,TeapotOfDoom,ohhh

10-01-2020T16:06:12,TeapotOfDoom,"neither do the green stripes, soo"
10-01-2020T16:06:29,SageSaga,he has a new car
10-01-2020T16:06:31,Ordithus,Snowing good now
10-01-2020T16:06:49,TeapotOfDoom,yeah a chevy bolt if i remember correctly
10-01-2020T16:06:54,Ordithus,nice
10-01-2020T16:07:10,TeapotOfDoom,also a miniatur tesla
10-01-2020T16:07:24,SageSaga,for someone who is a millionaire  he lives well bellow his means which is really nice...
10-01-2020T16:08:01,TeapotOfDoom,you think he's over a million?
10-01-2020T16:08:10,SageSaga,easily yes
10-01-2020T16:08:21,TeapotOfDoom,he seems more like a guy to reinvest that into the company
10-01-2020T16:08:31,SageSaga,i do think he sinks most of his profits back into his business though
10-01-2020T16:08:42,TeapotOfDoom,+1
10-01-2020T16:08:52,SageSaga,but i dont doubt he has over a million dollars for himself somewhere
10-01-2020T16:09:00,TeapotOfDoom,pretty sure
10-01-2020T16:09:02,SageSaga,a nest egg
10-01-2020T16:09:32,TeapotOfDoom,"if he wanted to, he could easily increase the cash flow from the business to him and it would prolly not even make a big difference"
10-01-2020T16:10:07,TeapotOfDoom,considering the amount of money they spend on equip not because they need to but because they want to
10-01-2020T16:10:41,SageSaga,he's really frugal

10-01-2020T18:51:03,ThingsAreMoving,"it's basically a hotplate, isn't it"
10-01-2020T18:51:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I can’t tell if it’s the seasoning or if zucchini is burning my throat

10-01-2020T19:03:01,Bigboi182,I'm trying to ignore the paper but I'm kinda interested as to what's there
10-01-2020T19:05:35,Bigboi182,"But, if you say ignore it, I guess I must..."
10-01-2020T19:07:02,SpazztasticKiwi,all it is I work on names to learn the letters
10-01-2020T19:07:36,SpazztasticKiwi,my favorites are the e c & y

10-01-2020T19:09:01,Bigboi182,I do really like the letters
10-01-2020T19:09:17,Bigboi182,They have that medieval vibe to them.
10-01-2020T19:11:00,ThingsAreMoving,"That looks pretty nice, kiwi. Is that a fried rice?"
10-01-2020T19:11:25,SpazztasticKiwi,yep
10-01-2020T19:11:45,SpazztasticKiwi,some sort of pepper in it but I don’t know what
10-01-2020T19:12:35,ThingsAreMoving,"looks like common black pepper, maybe it's mixed with something else."
10-01-2020T19:13:08,SpazztasticKiwi,all I know is I’m full but it’s so good
10-01-2020T19:14:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera’s mad I said he can’t have a bite
10-01-2020T19:14:05,ThingsAreMoving,can relate. I had two bowls of Dan dan Noodles I've made today and can't even think of eating anything else
10-01-2020T19:14:31,ThingsAreMoving,does he even like broccoli?
10-01-2020T19:14:41,SpazztasticKiwi,he’ll eat it
10-01-2020T19:14:52,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s eaten raw broccoli before
10-01-2020T19:15:29,SpazztasticKiwi,or tried to - I gave it to him to sniff and he was just like “hmmm” *cronch*
10-01-2020T19:16:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"“he’s not gonna eat it, I’ll just let him sniff as he’ll lose intr-“ :ptv-confused:"
10-01-2020T19:16:55,ThingsAreMoving,"I do have limited experience with cats, but most of the time they ask for food they're just curious of what's going on, and once they satisfy their curiosity they go mind their own business"
10-01-2020T19:17:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"I know he wants to sniff everything I handle so most cases, I do"
10-01-2020T19:18:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"“it’s a carrot, he won’t tey eating a carro-I give up”"
10-01-2020T19:19:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’m about convinced that if he sees me eat it, he’s going to at least try it"
10-01-2020T19:21:30,ThingsAreMoving,"""human likes it, wonder if I'll like it too"""
10-01-2020T19:21:51,ThingsAreMoving,ya gotta be patient af to have cats
10-01-2020T19:22:01,ThingsAreMoving,or have a certain mindset i suppose.
