24-05-2020T00:00:08,WINDOWS98SE,"Been trying to get my mother to use it.  She currently uses a massive and messy .txt file for her shopping, bills and such."
24-05-2020T00:01:24,WINDOWS98SE,"Personally still use Excel for my light bulb collection, although I need to do a recount now since my dad has been taking bulbs without my permission."
24-05-2020T00:02:32,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah right the polls
24-05-2020T00:02:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember you saying you used it for something for the streams but wasn’t fully clear on what exactly
24-05-2020T00:03:18,Dadrobit,"Took a similar class a few years back, something along the lines of Basics of the Microsoft Suite. Just spent a month in Powerpoint/Word/Excel/Access each. Super basic, essentially a free credit."
24-05-2020T00:03:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember when they taught us excel in school
24-05-2020T00:03:35,Dadrobit,Was back when I was considering getting into IT.
24-05-2020T00:03:49,SpazztasticKiwi,the teacher made sure everyone was clear on how to print an excel sheet
24-05-2020T00:04:18,SpazztasticKiwi,someone had made an unfortunate legend of himself by effectively breaking the printer
24-05-2020T00:05:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"told the computer to print and it started to print the entire chart of excel.....aaaalll of it, which as you know, is endless"
24-05-2020T00:06:05,SpazztasticKiwi,even turning off the computer and printer didn’t work - it printed day and night
24-05-2020T00:07:03,AspiringNoodle,Good thing the printer couldn't materialize paper
24-05-2020T00:07:14,AspiringNoodle,That would be an XK-class end of the world scenario right there :ptv-laugh:
24-05-2020T00:07:18,AspiringNoodle,Just endless paper!
24-05-2020T00:07:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"when it ran out of paper, it stopped & waited for more"
24-05-2020T00:07:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t know how they said they stopped it if excel is endless & it was set to print it all
24-05-2020T00:08:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I have 2011 office on my computer - one person ownership
24-05-2020T00:10:07,SpazztasticKiwi,used it to write all my papers and work my stuff in college
24-05-2020T00:11:03,SpazztasticKiwi,still annoyed that the teacher showed little evidence of actually reading through the paragraph per question answer work
24-05-2020T00:12:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I put good work into all of them but once or twice I pulled some fierce non-answer fillers because I didn’t for the life of me get what it wanted me to answer
24-05-2020T00:12:48,SpazztasticKiwi,& I yet got charming grades
24-05-2020T00:16:22,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, I identify with the printer person"
24-05-2020T00:16:35,AspiringNoodle,I once borked a program in one of my earliest programming classes.
24-05-2020T00:17:06,AspiringNoodle,"Not even joking, I poured over this thing and the code was flawless.  It was optimal as I could make it, there were no flaws anywhere."
24-05-2020T00:17:16,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s a case of not listening to directions or following them
24-05-2020T00:17:20,AspiringNoodle,"Yet I somehow had everything arranged in such a way that I broke a loop, lol"
24-05-2020T00:17:54,AspiringNoodle,I broke a for loop.  Like... you can pre-determine how those things run
24-05-2020T00:17:58,AspiringNoodle,And I broke it
24-05-2020T00:18:02,SpazztasticKiwi,& for some reason the fact the school was wound tight for paper yet had the gym laminated for thousands every year
24-05-2020T00:18:51,Ordithus,"fyi it is pretty easy to cancel a print job - open devices and printers, see what's printing, cancel the job"
24-05-2020T00:18:57,AspiringNoodle,"So, here's how broken the program was"
24-05-2020T00:19:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t know if they tried that though I wouldn’t doubt they didn’t think of it
24-05-2020T00:19:32,AspiringNoodle,for(i = 0; i < 10; i++)
24-05-2020T00:19:57,AspiringNoodle,"I somehow broke this effing line of code earlier in the program through no fault of my own, lol"
24-05-2020T00:20:19,SpazztasticKiwi,if you say you broke it how’s it not your fault
24-05-2020T00:20:27,AspiringNoodle,At some point I added a print in the for loop to see what was going on
24-05-2020T00:20:45,SpazztasticKiwi,last time I saw 0s & is I was in pre cal
24-05-2020T00:21:02,AspiringNoodle,"Btw, this was for a simple game with text characters"
24-05-2020T00:21:19,AspiringNoodle,i = 0
24-05-2020T00:21:22,AspiringNoodle,i = 1
24-05-2020T00:21:22,SpazztasticKiwi,you’re talking to the wrong person on coding
24-05-2020T00:21:24,AspiringNoodle,i = 2
24-05-2020T00:21:25,AspiringNoodle,i = 2
24-05-2020T00:21:42,AspiringNoodle,and so on
24-05-2020T00:22:09,AspiringNoodle,Here's how I fixed up
24-05-2020T00:22:27,AspiringNoodle,Up near the start of the program in the section blocked off for variable declaration / initialization
24-05-2020T00:22:34,AspiringNoodle,int i;
24-05-2020T00:22:39,AspiringNoodle,"int i, dummy;"
24-05-2020T00:22:50,AspiringNoodle,"I added "", dummy"" and it fixed the program"
24-05-2020T00:23:01,AspiringNoodle,Like... it still boggles my mind to this day xD
24-05-2020T00:23:05,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:*[K]

24-05-2020T00:23:16,johnnytho,"Coding is hard, cannot for the life of me understand that black, unholy magic."
24-05-2020T00:23:17,AspiringNoodle,Now you know how I feel
24-05-2020T00:23:35,AspiringNoodle,I ADDED AN UNUSED DUMMY VARIABLE TO THE PROGRAM
24-05-2020T00:23:43,AspiringNoodle,AND IT FIXED A LOOP
24-05-2020T00:23:53,AspiringNoodle,WT-LITERAL-F
24-05-2020T00:24:33,Ordithus,a good sign of not knowing what you're doing!
24-05-2020T00:24:43,SpazztasticKiwi,idunno man sometimes you need a dummy to fill the hole
24-05-2020T00:24:45,AspiringNoodle,"Or that I discovered a flaw in the compiler, lol"
24-05-2020T00:25:01,AspiringNoodle,"Because even my professors, multiple of them, 2 separate colleges, couldn't figure it out."
24-05-2020T00:25:04,SpazztasticKiwi,this is barely English to half of us
24-05-2020T00:25:13,johnnytho,yup
24-05-2020T00:25:25,AspiringNoodle,I should just become a flippin' bug tester at this rate
24-05-2020T00:25:29,AspiringNoodle,I seem to be good at breaking things
24-05-2020T00:25:44,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s a demolition expert
24-05-2020T00:25:52,AspiringNoodle,Doom 2016?  Fell through the map within the first 2 minutes of playing
24-05-2020T00:25:59,SpazztasticKiwi,don’t coders have the rubber ducky solution
24-05-2020T00:26:15,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
24-05-2020T00:26:22,johnnytho,"Back in high school I though I was smart and joined the software development club. I thought they would teach me some stuff, but they just got frustrated with me. They were good too they would do hackathons and stuff"
24-05-2020T00:26:35,SpazztasticKiwi,they keep a rubber duck at their desk & when there’s a problem they explain it to the duck until they find the problem
24-05-2020T00:26:50,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s like putting your essay in translate to find bugs
24-05-2020T00:26:52,AspiringNoodle,"That's just the thing, lol"
24-05-2020T00:26:58,AspiringNoodle,My program was ironclad
24-05-2020T00:27:06,AspiringNoodle,By all accounts it *should* have been perfectly functional
24-05-2020T00:27:14,AspiringNoodle,And I ended up fixing it with a nonsensical solution.
24-05-2020T00:27:46,SpazztasticKiwi,AN IDEA 💡
24-05-2020T00:28:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"Sythe, using Nibbly as a toupee"
24-05-2020T00:28:19,AspiringNoodle,Because Karen accidentally gave him a bald spot? :ptv-snicker:
24-05-2020T00:28:43,Ordithus,I've got news for you
24-05-2020T00:29:06,SpazztasticKiwi,....spit it out then
24-05-2020T00:29:09,Ordithus,you should watch the very end of the vod
24-05-2020T00:29:26,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah I saw bits and that spot
24-05-2020T00:29:38,WINDOWS98SE,"@SpazztasticKiwi Huh, so that's the function of a rubber duck. :thinking:"
24-05-2020T00:29:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"some would load, but I wasn’t participating"
24-05-2020T00:29:59,SpazztasticKiwi,or really watching
24-05-2020T00:30:07,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s what it was called actually
24-05-2020T00:30:28,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, I looked it up, lol"
24-05-2020T00:30:33,SpazztasticKiwi,you know there’s someone that graphed a rubber duck & made it a formula
24-05-2020T00:30:45,AspiringNoodle,It's actually a common problem solving method
24-05-2020T00:31:07,AspiringNoodle,"Sometimes when you have trouble finding a solution, explaining it to someone else can help you see something you missed :D"
24-05-2020T00:31:24,SpazztasticKiwi,but sythe balding & Nibbly tryin to help out by filling that empty patch in his life
24-05-2020T00:31:34,SpazztasticKiwi,friendship

24-05-2020T01:30:10,Dadrobit,I'm off tonight. Was busy for a sec doing stuffs.

24-05-2020T01:39:38,AspiringNoodle,I'm looking forward to a meeting on tuesday at work
24-05-2020T01:40:01,AspiringNoodle,Should be fun
24-05-2020T01:40:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"yeah, it’s even in the Bible that church is only needs a Bible and a gathering"
24-05-2020T01:41:01,SpazztasticKiwi,besides the point that you should never have to be seen going
24-05-2020T01:41:19,AspiringNoodle,"Thank the lord I'm not religious, lol"
24-05-2020T01:41:42,SpazztasticKiwi,reading at home is supposed to be just as powerful and effective
24-05-2020T01:42:48,SpazztasticKiwi,exactly what I stick to - a new church means everyone wants to shake hands and know your life story and old church means everyone wants the data backlog
24-05-2020T01:43:27,WINDOWS98SE,"For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.  Matthew 18:20"
24-05-2020T01:43:54,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah that
24-05-2020T01:44:45,WINDOWS98SE,The bible talk reminds me of a couple of fanart Twokinds pieces.  I'll see if I can find them.
24-05-2020T01:45:14,WINDOWS98SE,They were really well done.  Almost like Tom's style.
24-05-2020T01:45:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"but yeah, someone parked in the emergency services plot"
24-05-2020T01:46:03,SpazztasticKiwi,pulled in when the tow truck was loadin er up & the cops were pulling out
24-05-2020T01:47:18,SpazztasticKiwi,can’t think of any other thing they’d tow it for - they don’t show care for handicap or crooked or that’s not a parking spot violators

24-05-2020T01:49:19,SpazztasticKiwi,sort of like a rendition if Moses was an animal man
24-05-2020T01:49:43,SpazztasticKiwi,or if animals had a Moses version
24-05-2020T01:56:17,SpazztasticKiwi,say have you tried the bacon potato skin chips
24-05-2020T01:56:50,WINDOWS98SE,Never heard of them.
24-05-2020T01:57:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"they’re chips...that are meant to taste like potato skins, which is what chips are, with bacon & cheese"
24-05-2020T01:57:30,SpazztasticKiwi,they essentially made cheesy bacon flavored chips
24-05-2020T01:57:45,SpazztasticKiwi,like cookies n cream flavored oreos
24-05-2020T01:58:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"I mean, they’re good but...someone got paid for this idea"
24-05-2020T01:58:37,WINDOWS98SE,"Sounds nice!  I like cheese and I like bacon, so I imagine I'd like them."
24-05-2020T01:59:23,SpazztasticKiwi,they are good - I bought one the other day to try & liked em
24-05-2020T01:59:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"but walmart doesn’t sell them, only dollar tree does so I had to go there for more but I know the cashier"

24-05-2020T02:27:06,AspiringNoodle,And that last match was nothing but root / stun / burst instant-death combos
24-05-2020T02:53:07,SpazztasticKiwi,🦉 whooooos seen an owl run
24-05-2020T02:53:15,SpazztasticKiwi,because it’s great

24-05-2020T02:57:51,SpazztasticKiwi,bad time to wake up from a nap
24-05-2020T02:58:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"folks, I just ate some Vienna sausages from a brand that I’ve never had...."
24-05-2020T02:58:59,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s starting not to feel so good
24-05-2020T03:00:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"nausea pending, I’m glad I have my own bathroom right outside my door"
24-05-2020T03:00:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"anyhow, Tom, you’ve seen an owl run?"
24-05-2020T03:00:48,SpazztasticKiwi,🦵 the leggies
24-05-2020T03:19:11,Twokinds,yeah

24-05-2020T03:48:50,Dadrobit,Left to go do some reading and the computer went and borked itself. RIP chat for me.
24-05-2020T04:01:18,SpazztasticKiwi,not too much happened
24-05-2020T04:02:59,Dadrobit,First thing I see in my chat is Windows posting weird shit with Keith and the Ten Commandments.
24-05-2020T04:05:41,Dadrobit,And the second one leads to an art of Laura with a link to buy.... Chibi Sailor Moon porn....
24-05-2020T04:06:08,Dadrobit,Talk about needing
24-05-2020T04:06:11,Dadrobit,Jesus
24-05-2020T04:07:47,Dadrobit,At least the first one has some reasoning behind it. Evidently it was made for the IRC back in yonder days in homage of the rules set for the chat.
24-05-2020T04:10:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn’t see any link
24-05-2020T04:11:01,SpazztasticKiwi,why on earth would you look that deep
24-05-2020T04:11:23,Dadrobit,It's in the description. Kinda just right there.
24-05-2020T04:11:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I wasn’t looking
24-05-2020T04:11:59,Dadrobit,I wish I hadn't.
24-05-2020T04:12:18,Dadrobit,Chibi Sailor Moon just looks... Like a child. Really uncomfortable.
24-05-2020T04:12:57,SpazztasticKiwi,yeaaaaaa the trend of making them look younger and younger & like dolls is
24-05-2020T04:13:10,SpazztasticKiwi,bad juju
24-05-2020T04:13:15,Dadrobit,I really wasn't expecting an artist who drew Laura with a cross reading a bible would link to something like that....
24-05-2020T04:13:54,SpazztasticKiwi,well you also got people that’ll dress as a sexy nun for halloween so
24-05-2020T04:14:17,SpazztasticKiwi,reason I don’t like kpop too much
24-05-2020T04:14:23,Dadrobit,For real tho. All this dude's porn is illegal as fuck.
24-05-2020T04:14:47,Dadrobit,Copyright and Trademark infringements aboud.
24-05-2020T04:14:47,SpazztasticKiwi,they’re young enough at something like 17? 16?
24-05-2020T04:15:26,SpazztasticKiwi,and then their style is colored contacts for blue eyes and coloring their hair with the same cut
24-05-2020T04:15:41,Dadrobit,"Like, it's one thing to just draw it and post it. But to make it paid? This motherfucker would owe so much fukkin money if a lawyer got wind of what he was doing."
24-05-2020T04:16:16,SpazztasticKiwi,there was a patreon mark on the picture right
24-05-2020T04:16:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m sure patreon wouldn’t be happy with some backstory
24-05-2020T04:16:36,Dadrobit,He sells his art in $15 packs.
24-05-2020T04:16:58,Dadrobit,"Not through Patreon, through a distro site called  Gumroad."
24-05-2020T04:17:19,Dadrobit,"But yeah, looks like he uses Picarto as well."
24-05-2020T04:17:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"maybe they’re more shady but confronted or contacted, they wouldn’t be able to let it slide legally"
24-05-2020T04:18:28,SpazztasticKiwi,half the reason I don’t like most anime
24-05-2020T04:18:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"if she’s 12, make her look 12 - if he’s 30, make him look 40"
24-05-2020T04:18:58,Dadrobit,"Not just Tom's stuff and Sailor Moon. Pokemon, Roger Rabbit, My Little Pony, and a bunch of other stuff I don't recognize."
24-05-2020T04:19:12,SpazztasticKiwi,for Christ’s sake don’t make them look the same age
24-05-2020T04:19:17,Dadrobit,I'd be shocked if he had a single original Character.
24-05-2020T04:19:31,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s plenty out there like that
24-05-2020T04:19:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve met one or two - like em young
24-05-2020T04:19:58,Dadrobit,I am aware. I'm just amazed at the brazenness of them SELLING it in packs.
24-05-2020T04:20:07,SpazztasticKiwi,or at least young looking which I have the unfortunate fate of
24-05-2020T04:21:33,Dadrobit,Also makes my skin crawl when I go to  Comic Cons and see artist hall just full of glossy prints of stuff like Overwatch for sale.
24-05-2020T04:21:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a bit of reserve visiting a furvention
24-05-2020T04:22:03,SpazztasticKiwi,or comicon
24-05-2020T04:22:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"cause of that - there’s few and there’s security, & people watch out for each other but all it takes is one"
24-05-2020T04:22:48,Dadrobit,At least at an Anthrocon there'd be mostly original art.
24-05-2020T04:23:12,Dadrobit,"Wait, you lost me, one what?"
24-05-2020T04:23:20,SpazztasticKiwi,one person
24-05-2020T04:23:33,Dadrobit,"what, like a mass shooter?"
24-05-2020T04:24:10,SpazztasticKiwi,nah I’m more on the mindset there’s some disturbing people that go to those cons to be nasty
24-05-2020T04:24:30,SpazztasticKiwi,plus there’s undesirables in general roaming around
24-05-2020T04:24:45,SpazztasticKiwi,going to a con means leaving before dark for the hotel for me
24-05-2020T04:25:11,SpazztasticKiwi,or getting one smack dab next door like at PAX
24-05-2020T04:25:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I can be dense but I’m not single woman walking home alone in an unknown city during a convention dense
24-05-2020T04:25:57,Dadrobit,The first PHX CC I went to had an attempted mass shooting. Kinda nutty. Made a lot of people very unhappy but luckily Phoenix PD were able to stop the dude before anyone got hurt.
24-05-2020T04:27:33,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-natsducky:

24-05-2020T04:28:38,Dadrobit,Lots of bananas in gun holsters and the like.
24-05-2020T04:29:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Phoenix is a gun carrying area tho right
24-05-2020T04:29:34,TerraTheWizard,"yeh, it 10:30am"

24-05-2020T04:30:11,SpazztasticKiwi,in the frigity frackin morning
24-05-2020T04:30:25,SpazztasticKiwi,or at least close to it
24-05-2020T04:30:27,TerraTheWizard,time to watch the recap at the end of the vod
24-05-2020T04:30:33,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-nibrun:
24-05-2020T04:30:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom did doodles
24-05-2020T04:30:43,SpazztasticKiwi,much wow
24-05-2020T04:30:47,Dadrobit,"Yeah, AZ is super loose with gun laws. But the Convention banned any and all weapons."
24-05-2020T04:30:59,Dadrobit,Including lightsabers.
24-05-2020T04:31:05,SpazztasticKiwi,even plastic knives
24-05-2020T04:31:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember that was something my school had
24-05-2020T04:31:33,SpazztasticKiwi,like somebody was gonna get shanked
24-05-2020T04:32:10,Dadrobit,One vendor had a huuuuuuuge meltdown because their unreasonably expensive lightsabers had to be put in shopping bags after they were sold.
24-05-2020T04:32:34,SpazztasticKiwi,why is that a problem
24-05-2020T04:32:45,SpazztasticKiwi,they’re still getting to sell them
24-05-2020T04:32:45,Dadrobit,They ended up having to be escorted out by the sheriff because they refused to comply.
24-05-2020T04:32:57,SpazztasticKiwi,a Karen?
24-05-2020T04:33:49,Dadrobit,Then they came back the next day with thousands of flyers that they plastered half the cars in the central PHX area with saying that PHC CC is shit and that they were mistreated and that everyone should get a refund.
24-05-2020T04:34:10,SpazztasticKiwi,a Karen
24-05-2020T04:34:31,Dadrobit,"Because, you know, the only reason you go to CC is to buy a $600 lightsaber."
24-05-2020T04:34:33,SpazztasticKiwi,or someone that never got hugged as a child
24-05-2020T04:34:54,SpazztasticKiwi,who on this planet is taking $600 for merch
24-05-2020T04:35:00,Dadrobit,o/
24-05-2020T04:35:09,Dadrobit,But I get a bunch of different shit.
24-05-2020T04:35:24,SpazztasticKiwi,BUT $600????
24-05-2020T04:35:44,Dadrobit,"Nah, most I think I ever spent once was like $350 or so."
24-05-2020T04:36:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean I was tempted to buy maybe two things at PAX & they were metal sculptures you put together yourself and yet I still decided against them
24-05-2020T04:36:25,Dadrobit,Some really nice models and a dank as all hell DOOM themed whisky box set.
24-05-2020T04:36:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I wasn’t sure if I’d actually put them together
24-05-2020T04:36:48,SpazztasticKiwi,& honestly there’s no telling if tsa would let me have them fly home
24-05-2020T04:37:02,Dadrobit,https://imgur.com/gallery/Uc6ul
24-05-2020T04:37:23,SpazztasticKiwi,you’ve shown that before
24-05-2020T04:37:36,Dadrobit,"I wanna put some felt in the box and light it up with some slowly pulsing red LEDs, but I've never found the time."
24-05-2020T04:37:54,Dadrobit,"Yeah, was pretty sure I had."
24-05-2020T04:37:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"I was focused on panels and meet n greets at PAX, not goodies"
24-05-2020T04:38:27,Dadrobit,"For sure, panels are the reason to go, but inbetween when you've got nothing else to do..."
24-05-2020T04:39:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder if that’ll be my only if not best bet this year cause anthros dead & nothing else is too fetching for me
24-05-2020T04:39:18,SpazztasticKiwi,comicon is just......California man
24-05-2020T04:39:36,SpazztasticKiwi,my grandpa lives there but....it’s California
24-05-2020T04:41:09,Dadrobit,"PHX CC, (They call it Phoenix Fan Fusion now because Comic Con got litigated to hell) is still on so far, just postponed to September. Dunno if that's still gonna hold tho."
24-05-2020T04:41:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Phoenix is 1300+ miles from me
24-05-2020T04:42:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"nope, 1500+"
24-05-2020T04:43:04,Dadrobit,"Yeah, just saying, dunno if my option is gonna hold up."
24-05-2020T04:43:15,Dadrobit,Missed last year unfortunately because money is a thing.
24-05-2020T04:44:11,SpazztasticKiwi,the website is saying hotels have canceled
24-05-2020T04:44:34,SpazztasticKiwi,did they change dates
24-05-2020T04:45:33,Dadrobit,For SDCC?
24-05-2020T04:47:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Phoenix
24-05-2020T04:47:37,Dadrobit,"Oh, yeah, that's what I was saying, it got postponed."
24-05-2020T04:48:26,Dadrobit,Normally it would have just happened this past weekend.
24-05-2020T04:48:52,SpazztasticKiwi,honestly I can’t see anything being safe until next year
24-05-2020T04:49:53,Dadrobit,"Yeah, this shit is gonna be screwing everyone for at least a year."
24-05-2020T04:50:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I want a vacation
24-05-2020T04:50:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I want a convention
24-05-2020T04:50:54,SpazztasticKiwi,but I’m over people
24-05-2020T04:52:42,Dadrobit,"Lol, just looked up last years convention. The weapon ban has been lifted, but some people are still just bringing bananas."
24-05-2020T04:53:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"do banana guns say pew pew, or kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk"
24-05-2020T04:53:47,Dadrobit,Potasium. I get it

24-05-2020T22:37:17,IronHorseComics,Raine R. R. Martin
24-05-2020T22:37:39,IronHorseComics,"what? With her shipfics, she might as well be"

24-05-2020T22:41:29,Sclimshady,Think of it as job security
24-05-2020T22:41:58,MuonNeutrino,raine is only GRRM if she also kills off half of the characters by the end of each fic
24-05-2020T22:44:21,jesonite,"Kame -  About my old Art, Still have found memories of those and I still like most of those pics, althou I couldn´t say that much about the pre DA/Internet Era /not posted/, some of those pics are sometimes akward to look at lol"
24-05-2020T22:44:38,Kameloh,aw man XD
24-05-2020T22:44:48,Kameloh,did you ever save any of those :cat:
24-05-2020T22:47:18,jesonite,"I think I did, if I recall that right I put many of those drawing into a few foot folder organizers , I think those are still inside a room somewhere in my old apartment in CUU"
24-05-2020T22:47:28,Ordithus,Natani thinks he's so sly :ctwokinds-smug:
24-05-2020T22:48:08,Kameloh,:ckameloh-naokieyebrowshak:
24-05-2020T22:48:35,Kameloh,I always tell people to keep their old art as reference -- it's good to sometimes look back
24-05-2020T22:48:56,Sashimi,^
24-05-2020T22:49:05,jesonite,"Yeah! it a good reference point, you can totally track your progress with that"
24-05-2020T22:49:27,PurpleLemons,at this point I don't remember my old work lol

24-05-2020T22:52:56,Sclimshady,We gotta wage a war to get it back
24-05-2020T22:53:01,ThingsAreMoving,that's a worthy cause
24-05-2020T22:53:05,Kameloh,I'm too lazy to paint so I'm gonna start doodlin

24-05-2020T22:53:42,Kameloh,I've been sluggish since the stream began
24-05-2020T22:53:49,Kameloh,so I'm like super slow at art right now XD
24-05-2020T22:54:08,PurpleLemons,same :snail:
24-05-2020T22:54:59,ThingsAreMoving,Sounds like you need some burnt bean brew :ctwokinds-kingtea:
24-05-2020T22:55:14,Kameloh,it's too late for that lol

24-05-2020T22:55:50,Ordithus,dang Natani looks awesome
24-05-2020T22:56:08,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Natani is awesome indeed
24-05-2020T22:56:10,Ordithus,all glowey and stuff
24-05-2020T22:56:23,Kameloh,really nice effects!
24-05-2020T22:56:37,Sclimshady,Nat got his serious face on
24-05-2020T22:56:49,ThingsAreMoving,"Nat seems to be well versed in magics, even if it's just dirty one"
24-05-2020T22:57:11,ThingsAreMoving,I sometimes wonder how many different spells does Nat know
24-05-2020T22:57:21,Sclimshady,2
24-05-2020T22:57:21,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Lewd magics???
24-05-2020T22:57:27,Sclimshady,at least
24-05-2020T22:57:34,ThingsAreMoving,you people are too thirsty sometimes
24-05-2020T22:57:36,ThingsAreMoving,really
24-05-2020T22:57:48,Ordithus,"Then there's Reni, who shouldn't have had the hot sauce"
24-05-2020T22:57:48,Sclimshady,:csclimshady-hornyjail:
24-05-2020T22:58:01,IronHorseComics,please do not lewd the Reni
24-05-2020T22:58:16,Twokinds,"Most of Natani's spells are basic, raw elemental magic."
24-05-2020T22:58:24,Twokinds,Which is the simpliest form of offensive magic.
24-05-2020T22:58:26,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,only Raine can lewd the Reni
24-05-2020T22:58:34,Twokinds,"So, wind, fire, lightning, ice, water, etc"
24-05-2020T22:58:40,Zakuru,don't forget heart
24-05-2020T22:58:59,jesonite,Tom - Neat! :fire:
24-05-2020T22:59:02,ThingsAreMoving,"Also,, uber door lock spell from basitin island arc"
24-05-2020T22:59:03,IronHorseComics,heart is just the magic she uses on Keith
24-05-2020T22:59:06,Zakuru,How else will Captian Planet save Maren
24-05-2020T22:59:15,Twokinds,"Natani has very few ""advance spells""."
24-05-2020T22:59:23,Ordithus,Mike's butt - the secret to saving Maren?
24-05-2020T22:59:33,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
24-05-2020T22:59:38,Twokinds,Pretty much just the heart's desire spell and the mark and recall spell.
24-05-2020T22:59:55,ThingsAreMoving,Imagine what power Nat could have if she'd have proper learnings
24-05-2020T23:00:01,Twokinds,"And scent covering, of course."
24-05-2020T23:00:15,unsteddyphoenix,Dont forget boob hiding
24-05-2020T23:00:20,InTheLionsDen,The dimensional wrappings isn't too shabby
24-05-2020T23:00:44,Ordithus,and the Maren illusion
24-05-2020T23:00:47,ThingsAreMoving,"so, destruction, enchanting and illusion"
24-05-2020T23:01:03,MuonNeutrino,which spell is the 'mark and recall' one? the teleport he used during the basitin isles arc?
24-05-2020T23:01:16,ThingsAreMoving,sounds like most of my mages from skyrim playthroughs
24-05-2020T23:01:18,Twokinds,"Every two-bit assassin type knows the scent covering spell, as it's dead useful among wolves."

24-05-2020T23:01:39,unsteddyphoenix,I just wonder where he got the bindings from
24-05-2020T23:01:57,Twokinds,"And yeah, mark and recall is just... marking a place, and then teleporting back to it. It's the most basic teleport spell, as it requires you to have already been there and set it up ahead of time."
24-05-2020T23:02:47,InTheLionsDen,Very handy for a quick and safe exit.
24-05-2020T23:03:06,ThingsAreMoving,looooooore
24-05-2020T23:03:16,MuonNeutrino,"and yet, even with that natani still seems quite competent at magic, imagine what he could do if he had real training"
24-05-2020T23:03:38,Bellhead,I just wish I could see the stream...
24-05-2020T23:03:46,MuonNeutrino,he seems to have a real knack for it even self-taught
24-05-2020T23:03:49,Sashimi,"Welp, imma head out now. Getting close to snooze time. Have a good night, everyone"
24-05-2020T23:03:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Kame that is a comfy looking scarf you got there

24-05-2020T23:04:23,Twokinds,"Natani's pretty good, though... I'm not sure how well Natani would do in a traditional academic setting."
24-05-2020T23:04:39,Twokinds,Something tells me he'd be the type to slack off.
24-05-2020T23:04:41,MuonNeutrino,.... poorly? >.>
24-05-2020T23:05:08,Zakuru,What would Nat actually be interested in learning?
24-05-2020T23:05:19,unsteddyphoenix,"Only be interested in the ""practical"" spells"
24-05-2020T23:05:27,ThingsAreMoving,"Yeah, school can turn even the most passionate people into hollow husks"

24-05-2020T23:05:45,Zakuru,maybe some songs ^w^
24-05-2020T23:05:56,MuonNeutrino,"well, i'd imagine he might like the sort of training that would let his spellcasting experimentation be more efficient, like he was talking about when experimenting with the boob disguise illusion"
24-05-2020T23:06:18,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,:ctwokinds-awoo:\
24-05-2020T23:06:21,Twokinds,Natani's a pretty practical wolf. Learn what's useful. But the fundimentals necessary to learn advanced magic might be too frustrating.
24-05-2020T23:07:03,MuonNeutrino,natani *does* seem like the 'shortest distance between two points is a straight line' sort of person <.<
24-05-2020T23:07:26,unsteddyphoenix,Anything complicated might be difficult for her too :^)
24-05-2020T23:07:34,MuonNeutrino,v0v

24-05-2020T23:08:06,Bellhead,"No, just untrained."
24-05-2020T23:08:17,Twokinds,"For the bandages, Natani doesn't know how it works, just that it does. It's a copy and paste job."
24-05-2020T23:08:21,MuonNeutrino,"i could imagine him not having enough patience for some things, but not because he's not smart enough for it"
24-05-2020T23:08:39,MuonNeutrino,huh. wonder where he got the originals from
24-05-2020T23:09:04,Twokinds,Probably from some sort of enchanted bag or something that displaces it's content's mass.
24-05-2020T23:09:16,Bellhead,Does that mean the one of about how his bandages work isn't canon?
24-05-2020T23:09:21,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles: bag of holding

24-05-2020T23:09:58,MuonNeutrino,"well, iirc in that comic he explained *what* the bandages do, but he didn't explain *how* they do that"
24-05-2020T23:09:59,BadFoMo,@Bellhead Which one is that?
24-05-2020T23:10:10,Sclimshady,Dont eat the tiddies Teddy
24-05-2020T23:10:12,ThingsAreMoving,and generates black holes
24-05-2020T23:10:17,MuonNeutrino,he can know that the bandages send things to a pocket dimension without understanding the details of how the magic accomplishes that
24-05-2020T23:10:29,BadFoMo,"...Also, back. My lore sences were tingling."
24-05-2020T23:10:35,ThingsAreMoving,o/

24-05-2020T23:11:06,Bellhead,"""Uhh, probably shouldn't have them go to the SAME pocket space"" ""I KNOW THAT NOW!"" ... sound familiar, BadFoMo?"

24-05-2020T23:21:21,Dimensional,Nibbly in a hole in a pocket dimension.
24-05-2020T23:21:28,Rainelover,Why is the stream taking so long to buffer?
24-05-2020T23:21:30,Dimensional,Or maybe in a hole in the bottom of the sea?

24-05-2020T23:29:17,Kameloh,does this mean game time :eyes:
24-05-2020T23:29:20,MuonNeutrino,"doesn't mean natani has necessarily considered the idea, though"

24-05-2020T23:49:31,Twokinds,watah

24-05-2020T23:49:48,PurpleLemons,steel is heavier than feathers
24-05-2020T23:49:49,unsteddyphoenix,day or noight free o' charge~
24-05-2020T23:50:15,TheSexyBeast,👍
24-05-2020T23:50:22,MuonNeutrino,only if you have more of it than the feathers
24-05-2020T23:50:36,unsteddyphoenix,no thats cheating
24-05-2020T23:51:01,Sclimshady,"Feathers are heavier,  imagine the weight of what you did to those birds"
24-05-2020T23:51:30,MuonNeutrino,"you have to blow up a star to get the iron in the steel, though, much more terrifying"
24-05-2020T23:51:33,unsteddyphoenix,steal the feathers
24-05-2020T23:52:05,TheSexyBeast,What weighs more: a pound of steel or a pound of feathers?
24-05-2020T23:52:23,MuonNeutrino,"ignoring any air trapped in the feathers, the same, of course"
24-05-2020T23:52:43,Ordithus,the steel will hurt more if it hits you in the face
24-05-2020T23:52:55,BadFoMo,Haxs!
