01-11-2020T00:01:51,Snowmanwizard,"Couldnt help it, i Agree its  a over used joke  though"
01-11-2020T00:01:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I blame the lack of ability to think for themselves
01-11-2020T00:02:27,SpazztasticKiwi,try to help it - it‚Äôs tasteless
01-11-2020T00:04:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll more roll my eyes over it but to some it‚Äôs insulting
01-11-2020T00:04:51,SpazztasticKiwi,now ord....?

01-11-2020T00:09:16,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,"Yes it was me, and I still don‚Äôt know your gender. I‚Äôm just thinking your both not to insult you lol"
01-11-2020T00:09:22,SpazztasticKiwi,November 1 is a notable marker
01-11-2020T00:09:35,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
01-11-2020T00:10:02,Ordithus,"I mean, does it really matter that much to you?"
01-11-2020T00:10:26,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,A little.
01-11-2020T00:10:30,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Idk why tho

01-11-2020T00:11:38,SpazztasticKiwi,you know the tale of the person that wished for all knowledge
01-11-2020T00:11:48,SpazztasticKiwi,their brain exploded
01-11-2020T00:11:56,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,I don‚Äôt wish for all knowledge.
01-11-2020T00:11:59,SpazztasticKiwi,not all needs a label
01-11-2020T00:12:00,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Ewwww
01-11-2020T00:12:08,Ordithus,we don't speak of that movie

01-11-2020T00:12:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I have no idea what you‚Äôre going on about
01-11-2020T00:13:16,Ordithus,nothing then
01-11-2020T00:13:20,Ordithus,all is good
01-11-2020T00:14:32,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,I don‚Äôt want all knowledge. I don‚Äôt wanna know about the floor of a factory
01-11-2020T00:14:58,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,"Plus, knowing all would be disturbing"
01-11-2020T00:15:14,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,And disappointing
01-11-2020T00:16:36,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,"Well, bye I guess. Now the question is back in my head :/"
01-11-2020T00:16:53,KeefMcDerpface,bye TB(?)

01-11-2020T00:17:22,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,And*
01-11-2020T00:17:23,Ordithus,night tb
01-11-2020T00:18:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"point being you don‚Äôt need to know if someone‚Äôs boy or girl - some don‚Äôt care to tell, some don‚Äôt consider themselves either"
01-11-2020T00:18:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"above all it doesn‚Äôt matter, there‚Äôs people here"
01-11-2020T00:18:37,SpazztasticKiwi,that‚Äôs all that matters to understand
01-11-2020T00:18:53,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Love that you said that as I was about to leave CD
01-11-2020T00:18:56,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,XD
01-11-2020T00:18:58,SpazztasticKiwi,~to be understood
01-11-2020T00:19:06,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,At least I just barely saw it
01-11-2020T00:20:04,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,"And, I don‚Äôt care that much normally. They just bug me for some reason"
01-11-2020T00:20:15,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,"Idk why, but they do"
01-11-2020T00:21:08,SpazztasticKiwi,humans have a neatly disgusting tendency to stick their noses so deeply in things for the sole purpose of giving it a label
01-11-2020T00:21:13,SpazztasticKiwi,nearly
01-11-2020T00:21:58,SpazztasticKiwi,curiosity & the desire to understand things on a level or with ways they understand
01-11-2020T00:22:03,SpazztasticKiwi,that‚Äôs all
01-11-2020T00:22:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd like to know why my cat likes to hop over the doorway of the bathroom instead of just walking through
01-11-2020T00:22:54,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,But you‚Äôll never know
01-11-2020T00:23:05,Ordithus,yer cat is superstitious and doesn't want to break your back
01-11-2020T00:23:18,SpazztasticKiwi,but the only explanation I can get is he‚Äôs just weird
01-11-2020T00:23:43,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,"I that reminds me, my cat is better now. He‚Äôs still on meds but he‚Äôs back to normal"
01-11-2020T00:23:48,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Oh*
01-11-2020T00:23:50,SpazztasticKiwi,why‚Äôs he randomly hop while standing in one place then
01-11-2020T00:24:08,Ordithus,good!
01-11-2020T00:24:17,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs like he was raised by guinea pigs
01-11-2020T00:24:21,Ordithus,was he?
01-11-2020T00:24:26,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,^
01-11-2020T00:24:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I got him as a wee kitten
01-11-2020T00:24:45,SpazztasticKiwi,with a fear of big dogs
01-11-2020T00:24:50,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floraquestion: are you a guinea pig
01-11-2020T00:25:18,SpazztasticKiwi,that‚Äôs an oldarse guinea pig
01-11-2020T00:25:38,Ordithus,pretty good at typing too
01-11-2020T00:27:04,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Your a smart guinea pig at that.
01-11-2020T00:27:48,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,That‚Äôs why you referred to humans in third person...
01-11-2020T00:35:55,SpazztasticKiwi,am I crabby today or has it all just deteriorated to that
01-11-2020T00:38:51,Ordithus,has the sarcasm morphed into crabbiness
01-11-2020T00:39:56,SpazztasticKiwi,nah
01-11-2020T00:40:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm tired but I guess I wonder more if I‚Äôm sounding mean
01-11-2020T00:46:50,Ordithus,meh

01-11-2020T01:23:04,AspiringNoodle,Double parry!
01-11-2020T01:26:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom did you ever share that Sam and colin had a story or only  an idea
01-11-2020T01:31:49,Dadrobit,There's some story built. A few early pages were released but Tom also said that they were done so long ago that his style has changed to the point that they need to be remade.
01-11-2020T02:18:21,SpazztasticKiwi,pomeranian spins like a turbine wanting to play - cat is unamused
01-11-2020T02:18:28,SpazztasticKiwi,ah pets
01-11-2020T02:18:48,Dadrobit,Did you ever see the pages or were they before you?
01-11-2020T02:19:14,Twokinds,Sam and Colin have a basic story
01-11-2020T02:19:21,Twokinds,But it's not really much
01-11-2020T02:20:49,Dadrobit,Small town dog makes it to the big city where anti-beast sentiment is publicly accepted. He accidentally meets up with struggling human author. That's about it for what I'm aware of.
01-11-2020T02:24:58,SpazztasticKiwi,nah never really saw or heard anything of it
01-11-2020T02:25:07,SpazztasticKiwi,all I got was that it was new
01-11-2020T02:28:41,Dadrobit,"https://imgur.com/a/ZvzpN0K I thought I had more, but maybe this was it."

01-11-2020T03:15:01,TerraTheWizard,"can';t tell if getting up for night shift is harder because it's getting winter, or because i'm just exhausted"
01-11-2020T03:15:14,TerraTheWizard,might be both
01-11-2020T03:16:57,AspiringNoodle,probably both

01-11-2020T04:23:37,AspiringNoodle,Just killed another player with the pitch-fork xD
01-11-2020T04:23:53,AspiringNoodle,"Best weapon, it has a charge attack where if you press a heavy attack button during it, you trip and fall on your face"
01-11-2020T04:23:55,AspiringNoodle,Is so silly
01-11-2020T04:53:20,CrRAR,too much bloodlust
01-11-2020T04:54:14,AspiringNoodle,"ibh, you can play dark souls with M+K, but I don't know how anyone would *want* to play this game without a controller"
01-11-2020T04:54:34,AspiringNoodle,Controls are just much more intuitive

01-11-2020T20:48:19,Ordithus,Yep. I voted absentee weeks ago. Turned that right back around about as soon as I got it
01-11-2020T20:48:31,Ordithus,Even though my polling place is literally in my backyard ha
01-11-2020T20:51:03,AspiringNoodle,Hopefully it'll be somewhat empty and I don't spend more than 30 minutes in all
