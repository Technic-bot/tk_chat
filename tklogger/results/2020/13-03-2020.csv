13-03-2020T17:31:18,RimaDraws,>>
13-03-2020T17:32:04,ShamusTheFox,I have never smoked and have only had a minor dalliance with alcoholic drinks. They do not appeal to me.
13-03-2020T17:35:00,RimaDraws,i regret smoking
13-03-2020T17:35:34,ShamusTheFox,"In retrospect, it's probably limited my social interactions somewhat, but most respect my choices."
13-03-2020T17:35:34,AspiringNoodle,I have fun selling tobacco to people who want to stop smoking
13-03-2020T17:36:11,AspiringNoodle,"Suffice to say, I'm a tad conflicted."
13-03-2020T17:39:08,ShamusTheFox,I remember growing up the intense smoke-filled haze of bowling alleys in my city. It was crazy how prevalent it was 30 years ago.
13-03-2020T17:39:49,ShamusTheFox,I think nowadays the only public places that allow smoking are casinos.
13-03-2020T17:40:20,AspiringNoodle,Part of it is is we know just how bad smoking is now.
13-03-2020T17:40:41,AspiringNoodle,"Not even joking, like half of my regulars say they need to stop smoking"
13-03-2020T17:40:50,AspiringNoodle,And a huge part of it is the cost.
13-03-2020T17:41:07,SpazztasticKiwi,alcohol Tom
13-03-2020T17:41:19,SpazztasticKiwi,a month without an alcoholic drink
13-03-2020T17:41:23,BadFoMo,I think he knows.
13-03-2020T17:41:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I know he knows
13-03-2020T17:41:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m ruining his troll moment
13-03-2020T17:41:56,BadFoMo,Oh...
13-03-2020T17:42:56,SpazztasticKiwi,but I mean it’s really good - he also told me he’s got a new job
13-03-2020T17:44:55,ShamusTheFox,That's good! Always nice to move forward!
13-03-2020T17:45:18,SpazztasticKiwi,there seems to be a movement on quitting smoking
13-03-2020T17:45:26,SpazztasticKiwi,both my managers have stopped too
13-03-2020T17:45:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"one because she found out she was pregnant, but I’m sure she plans the stop permanently after anyway"
13-03-2020T17:46:27,AspiringNoodle,"Personally, I couldn't smoke.  Ever."
13-03-2020T17:46:48,AspiringNoodle,Let's just say health class did its job.  Also videos of people cleaning curtains from smokers' homes
13-03-2020T17:47:08,AspiringNoodle,"""Why would ANYONE want that stuff near their lungs?!?"""
13-03-2020T17:47:16,SpazztasticKiwi,and the other because her doctor told her after her stay in the hospital for pneumonia that she wouldn’t live to see her son graduate if she continued
13-03-2020T17:47:41,SpazztasticKiwi,thats motivation right there
13-03-2020T17:49:47,SpazztasticKiwi,my dad smoked while I was an infant
13-03-2020T17:49:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I got bronchitis
13-03-2020T17:50:35,AspiringNoodle,...I think I need to consider stopping some stuff in my life
13-03-2020T17:58:25,AspiringNoodle,Good thing I basically hav ea week to sort things out!
13-03-2020T18:05:37,SpazztasticKiwi,lunch over
13-03-2020T18:10:33,AspiringNoodle,Watched 8-bit Ryan play a retail-themed horror game
13-03-2020T18:10:46,AspiringNoodle,"The entire time, I was watching and thinking, ""...Yup, this is accurate."" xD"
13-03-2020T18:18:42,ShamusTheFox,"I'm watching a Marvel vs Capcom 3 stream with top rated players, and they're having fun and joking about catching coronavirus. Gutsy. I appreciate people who are aware of the risk and are willing to take it to provide entertainment to people at home."
13-03-2020T18:19:07,ShamusTheFox,I just hope they make sure to quarantine themselves for a while afterwards.

13-03-2020T19:49:09,AspiringNoodle,Maybe I *should* quit WoW for good xD
13-03-2020T19:49:17,AspiringNoodle,"Love it, but it sucks up so much time."
13-03-2020T20:29:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I might not get my vacation time approved
13-03-2020T20:30:14,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s right during the fourth of july
13-03-2020T20:33:43,AspiringNoodle,hence why retail sucks? :P
