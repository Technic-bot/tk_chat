28-12-2020T15:23:54,CrimsonQuill,I wouldn't want to let my children near THAT clown
28-12-2020T15:23:59,CrRAR,"hooo boy, honestly that looks like one of the ""Ahhh real monsters"" deliberately disguised as something horrifying to terrorize children."

28-12-2020T15:25:20,CrRAR,"*Ickis, Oblina"
28-12-2020T15:26:13,CrRAR,that thing rocking also would make it so much more unsettling.
28-12-2020T15:26:27,CrRAR,why did they design it to rock!?
28-12-2020T15:27:01,CrRAR,imagine it just rocks on its own unattended late at night?

28-12-2020T18:16:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I got a hunts brothers pizza for dinner
28-12-2020T18:16:50,SpazztasticKiwi,forgot they put jalape√±os on it
28-12-2020T18:24:54,CrRAR,the outlets even look disappointed at the situation
28-12-2020T18:25:26,CrRAR,jalapenos by default?
28-12-2020T18:25:45,CrRAR,that's bold
28-12-2020T18:37:54,CrRAR,looking at a gif where a squirrel traded a pine cone for an almond I just found out there's specifically a reddit for squirrels eating pizza
28-12-2020T18:38:20,CrRAR,:pizza::ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
28-12-2020T19:00:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"bacon, pepperoni, sausage, Italian sausage, ham, cheese, banana peppers, jalapenÃÉos, mushrooms, olives, onions & a partridge in a pear tree"
28-12-2020T19:01:22,SpazztasticKiwi,plus bell peppers
28-12-2020T19:02:02,SpazztasticKiwi,which is what I fished off my lap when it dropped & then bit
28-12-2020T19:02:09,SpazztasticKiwi,it was not a bell pepper
28-12-2020T19:11:31,CrRAR,good ol‚Äô topping roulette

28-12-2020T19:39:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm only now half done with this pizza & it‚Äôs killing me
28-12-2020T19:40:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I got it thinking I‚Äôd get further
28-12-2020T19:41:05,Ordithus,pizza is amazing. many tasty meals
28-12-2020T19:47:07,SpazztasticKiwi,so I‚Äôve been pondering the absurd idea of getting a heat pad for Bagheera when I‚Äôm at work
28-12-2020T19:55:42,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-daydreamingkat: laundry on
28-12-2020T19:55:51,CrRAR,They always say those heatpads shouldn‚Äôt be run unattended but then some of them have ‚Äòoff‚Äô timers
28-12-2020T20:00:02,CrRAR,so go figure
28-12-2020T20:00:54,CrRAR,I always think like in all the time things are attended and don‚Äôt spontaneously combust WHY would it be during the brief absence things just go freaking kamakaze on everything
28-12-2020T20:01:54,CrRAR,just seems like some sort of probability conspiracy

28-12-2020T22:20:22,CrRAR,:ccrrar-kathat:
28-12-2020T22:32:54,SpazztasticKiwi,just go with it
28-12-2020T22:33:04,SpazztasticKiwi,can‚Äôt find any horror that‚Äôll play
28-12-2020T22:38:34,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs the best example of one lie snowballing fast & hard
28-12-2020T22:57:44,CrRAR,"Ahhh, yeah the ol fake it till ya matchmake it"
28-12-2020T22:58:08,CrRAR,I honestly forget the core plot of the film beyond the general points
28-12-2020T22:58:36,CrRAR,I was just thinking about 50 First Dates the other day
28-12-2020T22:58:43,CrRAR,that's a fun one
28-12-2020T22:59:23,CrRAR,I think it's because Drew has that new talkshow and the promos remind me that she seems to like to play a crazy person
28-12-2020T23:07:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Marks playing the forest & he says he‚Äôd give so much to go see a movie with just anyone
28-12-2020T23:07:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt have people that want to see the same ones I find interesting
28-12-2020T23:08:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve always ended up going with my mom and sister to the new disney or marvel stuff
28-12-2020T23:10:17,CrRAR,"Some of the best films are older ones, I went on a crusade years ago just tearing through great actors' filmographies and such"
28-12-2020T23:10:53,CrRAR,worst thing I tried to do was watch ALL the Bond movies in as few sittings as possible
28-12-2020T23:10:58,CrRAR,xD
28-12-2020T23:11:19,CrRAR,23 movies in like 2 or 3 days or something.
28-12-2020T23:12:59,CrRAR,the Jaws finds love moment was the most quntessential 70s hippie moment ever filmed
28-12-2020T23:13:40,CrRAR,"also when they retired the Original 'Q' was VERY sad, but nice"
28-12-2020T23:14:14,CrRAR,he like sunk into the ground on a platform giving some inspirational advice and such
28-12-2020T23:14:25,CrRAR,;~;
28-12-2020T23:21:34,SpazztasticKiwi,old movies are too dated for me to try
28-12-2020T23:22:14,CrRAR,it's a rabbit hole
28-12-2020T23:22:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I lose interest in most anything if it starts off bad
28-12-2020T23:24:32,CrRAR,I just have an appreciation cuz movies like classic novels are deliberately crafted to get a point across.
28-12-2020T23:25:53,CrRAR,so many fine details are toiled over by directors to get juuuusst right
28-12-2020T23:26:59,CrRAR,"the 90s had some great movies too, I don't specifically watch ancient stuff"
28-12-2020T23:27:39,CrRAR,"the biggest difference in oollldd movies is just simpler stories, no modern complications."
28-12-2020T23:27:56,CrRAR,the world was simpler in the black and white movie days
28-12-2020T23:33:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm real sick of tiktok being on fb
28-12-2020T23:34:54,CrRAR,"I got sick of social media when ""meme"" lost its original meaning and became bastardized."
28-12-2020T23:35:24,CrRAR,"meme in popular culture now roughly just means ""funny internet picture"""
28-12-2020T23:35:42,CrRAR,before it was a thing that followed a format
28-12-2020T23:35:56,CrRAR,kind of an internet in-joke
28-12-2020T23:36:25,CrRAR,now it's just whatever anyone wants to call one it
28-12-2020T23:37:54,CrRAR,but yeah most that stuff is just obnoxious
28-12-2020T23:38:20,CrRAR,attention-getting
28-12-2020T23:41:31,CrRAR,the one more recent memory one I still think is hilarious was the harlem shake stuff
28-12-2020T23:41:59,CrRAR,endless entertainment
28-12-2020T23:49:28,CrRAR,yet every trend tires out
28-12-2020T23:49:59,CrRAR,other than horror what movies are your favorites?
28-12-2020T23:54:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I will watch disney or marvel of course
28-12-2020T23:55:00,SpazztasticKiwi,but comedy is prime especially if it‚Äôs a horror comedy
28-12-2020T23:55:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"like, it‚Äôs ‚Äúscary‚Äù in a sort of exaggerated sense"
28-12-2020T23:55:45,SpazztasticKiwi,a horror movie that‚Äôs aware of itself or makes fun of itself
28-12-2020T23:57:52,CrRAR,"I might have to watch Hunt for the Wilderpeople again soon. It's like a live action version of Up kinda, based on the same story."
28-12-2020T23:58:03,CrRAR,like a grown-up Up
28-12-2020T23:58:16,CrRAR,it's a hoot :owl:
28-12-2020T23:58:58,SpazztasticKiwi,& I‚Äôm talking more about the cosplay UwU girl catastrophe that‚Äôs so typical with tictok
