23-08-2020T00:00:20,CrRAR,sounds like a job for someone with a lightsaber
23-08-2020T00:00:29,Ordithus,or nukes
23-08-2020T00:00:35,CrRAR,or those
23-08-2020T00:00:46,SpazztasticKiwi,no that sounds like a problem you just bomb tf put of
23-08-2020T00:00:49,SpazztasticKiwi,out
23-08-2020T00:00:57,CrRAR,hahaha
23-08-2020T00:01:01,SpazztasticKiwi,but what do they use?
23-08-2020T00:01:12,SpazztasticKiwi,shotguns & wishful thinking
23-08-2020T00:01:15,SpazztasticKiwi,with bad aim
23-08-2020T00:01:34,CrRAR,Can't use flamethrowers like the mein in black and other assored gov't agencies when something goes awry
23-08-2020T00:01:51,CrRAR,mein = men
23-08-2020T00:01:56,CrRAR,went german there a sec
23-08-2020T00:03:20,CrRAR,lol or I really want some lo mein
23-08-2020T00:03:36,Ordithus,mmm lo mein
23-08-2020T00:03:41,CrRAR,didn't realize those two things were spelled the same
23-08-2020T00:06:00,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz: night~
23-08-2020T00:06:07,CrRAR,:v: ord
23-08-2020T00:06:25,CrRAR,I'm about out of fuel too
23-08-2020T00:21:18,SpazztasticKiwi,kaprosuchus
23-08-2020T00:21:43,SpazztasticKiwi,when crocodiles had full legs
23-08-2020T00:22:55,SpazztasticKiwi,how did humans spawn when history was spitting stuff like kaprosuchus out
23-08-2020T00:25:47,CrRAR,lol
23-08-2020T00:26:09,CrRAR,We had brains and were like ‚ÄúKeep that thing the hell away from me‚Äù
23-08-2020T00:27:01,CrRAR,:ccrrar-fastbop: beebop me the hell away from that~
23-08-2020T00:28:31,SpazztasticKiwi,not to mention titanaboa
23-08-2020T00:28:49,SpazztasticKiwi,it could eat a modern alligator whole
23-08-2020T00:29:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"though with the anaconda/python problem in Florida, that‚Äôs been spotted today"
23-08-2020T00:29:43,SpazztasticKiwi,sooooo....titanaboa is still technically around in that sense
23-08-2020T00:37:48,CrRAR,"As long as they do not join up to form a superorganism, relations shall remain peaceful"
23-08-2020T00:38:09,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-kingtea:
23-08-2020T00:42:25,CrRAR,Reached last call for tea here. One more cup.
23-08-2020T00:42:41,CrRAR,"‚ÄúLAST CALL, last call~‚Äù"
23-08-2020T00:44:01,CrRAR,I miss that old show on Comedy Central with Dave Attell where he visited a bunch of cities for their nightlife and freaky attractions.
23-08-2020T00:45:35,CrRAR,The intro was very catchy and amusing
23-08-2020T00:47:31,CrRAR,He mostly spent a good part of the show trying to find interesting weirdos to hang out with. xD
23-08-2020T00:50:43,SpazztasticKiwi,ü¶âüçµ
23-08-2020T00:51:04,CrRAR,:tea::owl:
23-08-2020T00:57:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I got pepperoni & Bagheeras our here begging like a child on Christmas
23-08-2020T01:03:36,SpazztasticKiwi,out
23-08-2020T01:07:56,CrRAR,Cats like spicy?
23-08-2020T01:08:17,CrRAR,I guess mild ones aren‚Äôt so strong
23-08-2020T01:09:47,SpazztasticKiwi,he didn‚Äôt want a bite
23-08-2020T01:14:45,CrRAR,Was it the wrappers he listens for?
23-08-2020T01:27:33,SpazztasticKiwi,he hears the crackle and smells meat but didn‚Äôt want it
23-08-2020T01:27:50,SpazztasticKiwi,he wants to investigate anything I have
23-08-2020T01:28:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Se√°n‚Äôs cat is 5 in 8 days
23-08-2020T01:34:40,Dadrobit,"Okay, got a couple hours, now to stay away until at least sunrise."
23-08-2020T01:35:54,CrRAR,Nice flash nap
23-08-2020T01:36:39,Dadrobit,"Body feels broken. Took some melatonin before I got my nap, so my body desperately wants to be horizontal still."
23-08-2020T01:38:03,Dadrobit,Also. holy cow that last vote though
23-08-2020T01:38:19,CrRAR,ikr
23-08-2020T01:38:50,Dadrobit,Western Maddie stagnated in votes until the last few rounds until it won back to back coinflip rejections before landing in second.
23-08-2020T01:39:18,CrRAR,A strong contender for sure
23-08-2020T01:39:49,Dadrobit,Gotta hit up the vod and see what Tom did with the Rose thing.
23-08-2020T01:40:28,CrRAR,Prepare for feels
23-08-2020T01:40:56,Dadrobit,Still surprised he let that one into the vote tbh
23-08-2020T01:41:23,Dadrobit,Woulda thought 100% that it was something that he'd bring up in the comic proper
23-08-2020T01:42:31,CrRAR,"Yeah, could be similar events"
23-08-2020T01:42:53,CrRAR,Could be different version of how it plays out
23-08-2020T01:43:26,CrRAR,"It could unfold very different, still, ouch"
23-08-2020T01:43:39,Dadrobit,I'm on the recap now
23-08-2020T01:43:45,Dadrobit,5 was cutes
23-08-2020T01:43:47,Dadrobit,cute*
23-08-2020T01:43:54,CrRAR,Raine?
23-08-2020T01:45:07,Dadrobit,"Yeah, did Tom mention if he was gonna fill speech in later, or is it just gonna be be blank for audience interpretation?"
23-08-2020T01:46:01,CrRAR,Fill in laterw/ some magic sciency stuff
23-08-2020T01:46:10,Dadrobit,Gotcha
23-08-2020T01:46:20,CrRAR,Oh 5 was Amelia yis
23-08-2020T01:46:32,Dadrobit,On to 7 now. Fu-huckin oof.
23-08-2020T01:46:47,Dadrobit,Bedraggled Rose is a sight
23-08-2020T01:47:28,CrRAR,So scraggly
23-08-2020T01:48:25,Dadrobit,"Jesus, it's actually kinda hard to look at. Not a huge fan of Rose personally, but this does make me a little sympathetic for her."
23-08-2020T01:51:01,CrRAR,"Yeah, I guess her existence is most significant to Raine I guess, it‚Äôs more of just a demonstration of Trace‚Äôs madness"
23-08-2020T01:51:18,CrRAR,She‚Äôs so much of just an innocent bystander
23-08-2020T01:51:28,CrRAR,like Maren
23-08-2020T01:52:08,AspiringNoodle,Hey guys
23-08-2020T01:52:11,CrRAR,"‚ÄúEh you fit into my evil plot rather well, your humanity means nothing to me‚Äù"
23-08-2020T01:52:21,CrRAR,*azp*
23-08-2020T01:52:27,CrRAR,*zap*
23-08-2020T01:52:34,CrRAR,Hellloooo noodle
23-08-2020T01:52:40,AspiringNoodle,"Odds are, Trace might have persuaded Rose into his experiment"
23-08-2020T01:52:52,AspiringNoodle,"Extend her life, and give her a chance to see Rose again"
23-08-2020T01:53:11,CrRAR,"That‚Äôs somewhat what I feel, manipulated maybe"
23-08-2020T01:53:22,AspiringNoodle,"She was already depressed and ready to embrace death, hopefully see Rose on the other side"
23-08-2020T01:53:42,Dadrobit,I'd argue her existence is most significant to Euchre and Mary Silverlock tbqh.
23-08-2020T01:54:38,CrRAR,"That relationship is already a dumpsterfire though, no?"
23-08-2020T01:54:43,Dadrobit,No?
23-08-2020T01:55:29,Dadrobit,"I'm just saying, if Rose wasn't a thing, there's a chance they'd still be together without the breakup, and Trace might not have been able to take over the Templar."
23-08-2020T01:56:13,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-renirar:
23-08-2020T01:56:15,Dadrobit,"Euchre was instrumental in Trace's success, and he wouldn't have helped Trace had he known Mary had his child."
23-08-2020T01:56:27,TerraTheWizard,time to watch the strem vod :ctwokinds-nibrun:
23-08-2020T01:56:38,Dadrobit,"Tom mentioned it a while back, dunno if I have a screencap of it."
23-08-2020T01:56:57,CrRAR,Interesting
23-08-2020T01:57:03,AspiringNoodle,"Terra, there's a pleasant suprise in there for yeh"
23-08-2020T01:57:31,TerraTheWizard,is it cheese :cheese:
23-08-2020T01:58:18,CrRAR,"I though Euchre‚Äôs whole aim was to ascend to power anyway, ditching his Keidran identity"
23-08-2020T01:59:03,TerraTheWizard,wait when did picarto change the vod format from .flv to .mkv
23-08-2020T01:59:53,CrRAR,Mary was pissed enough when she learned through Rose I think of him... Raine would have been born as she was either way
23-08-2020T02:00:12,CrRAR,It sort of just moved up the discovery
23-08-2020T02:01:00,CrRAR,Trace was coming to power no matter what I thought then his master templar order was established?
23-08-2020T02:01:57,Dadrobit,:/ Can't find the screen
23-08-2020T02:02:29,CrRAR,"Yeah, I‚Äôd have to go back and do some rereading anyway"
23-08-2020T02:02:43,Dadrobit,"But yeah, while the discovery was definitely still gonna happen, there was likely a better way for it to happen without having half the town become suspicious of him in the same moment."
23-08-2020T02:03:09,CrRAR,"Ah, yeah"
23-08-2020T02:03:22,Dadrobit,"And there's even now still something of a bond between them, so there's a chance they could have figured it out."
23-08-2020T02:03:51,TerraTheWizard,"oh, my suggestion won"
23-08-2020T02:03:52,TerraTheWizard,nice
23-08-2020T02:04:08,CrRAR,whoop
23-08-2020T02:05:15,Dadrobit,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/167/
23-08-2020T02:06:52,TerraTheWizard,nerdy raine is a cute
23-08-2020T02:08:37,TerraTheWizard,"so i got 2 sketches this month, so double the chance of not getting anything win a colour vote :ctwokinds-keith8D:"
23-08-2020T02:11:43,CrRAR,"I could see then wanting to resolve things, just as it‚Äôs presented later all of Mary‚Äôs reputation and power and dignity in society is dismantled by Euchre and Trace‚Äôs actions."
23-08-2020T02:12:48,CrRAR,"I wonder is she‚Äôs desperate in that page, coming off doing the deal with the mask, she has no one to turn to other than Euchre"
23-08-2020T02:13:32,CrRAR,After that isn‚Äôt that when they get separated joining Raine up w/ team B?
23-08-2020T02:13:47,TerraTheWizard,that's what i figured
23-08-2020T02:14:00,CrRAR,I think that‚Äôs because Mary is still a social pariah
23-08-2020T02:14:20,TerraTheWizard,"i did a count of the days, not sure how lore accurate it is, but she had most likely been possessed by neutral for about 2 weeks at that point"
23-08-2020T02:14:30,Dadrobit,I think there's a very real world where they manage to figure themselves out and stay together without Rose's interference.
23-08-2020T02:14:34,CrRAR,And probably actively hunted for consorting with Euche in such a position
23-08-2020T02:16:30,CrRAR,"Yeah, I think the whole point, whether planned or not was to destroy Mary‚Äôs reputation by slandering her as having affairs with Keidran"
23-08-2020T02:17:07,CrRAR,Hence why trace made a joke of her turning her into one
23-08-2020T02:18:08,CrRAR,"Though, I guess the public were maybe probably unaware that was Euchre?"
23-08-2020T02:18:33,Dadrobit,That's a given. I just wonder what would become of Trace in such a world. Dude was still a young child when Euchre was kicked to the curb.
23-08-2020T02:19:00,Dadrobit,"Sorry, I'm not sure I understand, what was the public unaware of?"
23-08-2020T02:19:37,Dadrobit,Just that he was the Master Strategist?
23-08-2020T02:19:45,Dadrobit,And also Keidran
23-08-2020T02:19:47,CrRAR,"Like when trace took over with his order, Euchre would have remained human keeping the secret"
23-08-2020T02:20:29,Dadrobit,"Oh, I have no idea. I suspect It wasn't a secret between Trace and Euchre."
23-08-2020T02:20:31,CrRAR,Mary tried to keep it a secret too right?
23-08-2020T02:20:43,CrRAR,To preserve her OWN reop
23-08-2020T02:20:47,CrRAR,Rep
23-08-2020T02:20:49,Dadrobit,Euchre was likely the one who taught Trace the transformation spell he cast on Mary
23-08-2020T02:21:06,CrRAR,Possibly
23-08-2020T02:21:09,Dadrobit,Mary 100% tried to keep everything a secret
23-08-2020T02:21:32,Dadrobit,Hence Raine being kept in a veritable dungeon before Trace's coup.
23-08-2020T02:21:50,CrRAR,"See, but what Mary thought would be goodwill, Trave showed up and turned her silence against her"
23-08-2020T02:22:02,CrRAR,Yeah
23-08-2020T02:22:58,CrRAR,"So now you have former grandtemplar lady a wolf, her daughter, a wolf and the the public I guess wondering what the hell is going on"
23-08-2020T02:23:59,CrRAR,Then Trace steps in to quell I guess what is percieved as Keidran infultrating the highest ranks of the templar right?
23-08-2020T02:24:11,CrRAR,*infiltrating
23-08-2020T02:24:49,CrRAR,Meanwhile Euchre sits there in power what he is I guess
23-08-2020T02:26:19,Dadrobit,I was just wondering what the world would be like with a Silverlock Templar Master who's still got Euchre and her daughter influencing her life and decision making for well over a decade
23-08-2020T02:26:53,Dadrobit,Trace may have grown up in a very different world.
23-08-2020T02:27:10,CrRAR,It is interesting that after Trace‚Äôs fall Euchre has had to remain a wolf to stay hidden
23-08-2020T02:27:21,CrRAR,"I guess, right?"
23-08-2020T02:27:39,CrRAR,Even when he was imprisoned when he met Flora again
23-08-2020T02:28:47,CrRAR,Though that kinda may depend on just what Euchre and Edmund and everyone else are up to exactly
23-08-2020T02:28:49,Dadrobit,"I wonder if staying Keidran is a choice of necessity, or regret. Like he swore off of perfect transformation after he saw what his actions had wrought."
23-08-2020T02:29:01,CrRAR,Maybe!
23-08-2020T02:29:09,CrRAR,That would be interesting
23-08-2020T02:29:38,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
23-08-2020T02:30:28,CrRAR,I would think that Trace falling from power would supply at least a gut-check to him about what‚Äôs important
23-08-2020T02:31:01,CrRAR,"Though, whatever their plan is currently is still unfolding"
23-08-2020T02:32:36,Dadrobit,Going up a literal demi-god would provide something like a gut-check I could imagine yes
23-08-2020T02:33:56,CrRAR,I feel like Rose popping up in the story though significan was maybe more of a device to demonstrate just how far gone/committed Euchre was at that point?
23-08-2020T02:35:08,Dadrobit,"Yeah, of course he was commited. Dude was living his dream."
23-08-2020T02:35:17,CrRAR,"It was established that they grew up together and they were close him/Rose, so him dismissing her as nobody is him relenquishing his Wolf heritage"
23-08-2020T02:35:36,Dadrobit,Then a cousin he isn't fond of in the first place comes out of the woods and fucking destroys his dream.
23-08-2020T02:35:46,CrRAR,Which is funny because after the fall all he is is a wolf xD
23-08-2020T02:35:56,CrRAR,Yeah
23-08-2020T02:36:21,CrRAR,Yeah I do feel bad a bit for him from that standpoint
23-08-2020T02:36:55,CrRAR,He was a bit blinded by achievement I guess in what he was joining
23-08-2020T02:37:17,Dadrobit,"This was a person who picked on him as a kid, threatened to stab him as a ""prank"" and then shows up to a place where she knows she could be killed, and tries to drag him down with her."
23-08-2020T02:37:43,CrRAR,Yeah it is selfish
23-08-2020T02:37:52,Dadrobit,I legit have zero sympathy for Rose for her early life.
23-08-2020T02:38:20,CrRAR,Selfish seems to run in that side of the family
23-08-2020T02:39:08,CrRAR,They were both being selfish in different directions
23-08-2020T02:40:01,Dadrobit,I find Euchre blameless in the situation.
23-08-2020T02:40:20,Dadrobit,Dude was just living his dream.
23-08-2020T02:40:32,CrRAR,"And the stabby thing, maybe Rose was just trying to teach Euchre to keep his guard up"
23-08-2020T02:40:56,CrRAR,They lived in the woods with other wild animals afterall
23-08-2020T02:41:05,Dadrobit,Press x to doubt
23-08-2020T02:41:09,Dadrobit,XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
23-08-2020T02:41:27,CrRAR,...and I don‚Äôt think White x Brown wolves get along so well
23-08-2020T02:48:13,CrRAR,"Yeahhh, I‚Äôm just trying to see a way that something could have come out different... even if the Euchre x Mary things stayed manageable w/o Rose showing up, so Euchre somehow becomes part of Mary‚Äôs Templar order..."
23-08-2020T02:48:37,SpazztasticKiwi,tf is going on
23-08-2020T02:49:02,CrRAR,"Trace goes off with Saria, saria dies... Trace eventuallu emerges and deposes Mary w/ Euchre"
23-08-2020T02:49:40,CrRAR,Euchre probably just would not be tied up with Trace
23-08-2020T02:49:45,Dadrobit,"I imagine Mary, influenced by being in a relationship with Euchre and her daughter, might have thrown her political weight around to ease tensions with the Keidran."
23-08-2020T02:49:57,Dadrobit,That wolf assassin may have never happened
23-08-2020T02:51:17,CrRAR,I think the issue with the templar is (like we see with Maren/Red) that lots of people are superstitious and hate Keidran and expect the Templar to ‚Äòhandle‚Äô it
23-08-2020T02:51:34,CrRAR,Yeah Maey probably would have worked to normalize things
23-08-2020T02:51:39,CrRAR,Mary
23-08-2020T02:52:02,CrRAR,...but that takes time and the people probably were wary of that
23-08-2020T02:52:29,SpazztasticKiwi,if only effort like this was put in school
23-08-2020T02:52:48,SpazztasticKiwi,everyone would be in the honors society
23-08-2020T02:52:52,CrRAR,Hence why they were so quick to embrace Trace and his message
23-08-2020T02:52:54,Dadrobit,"I mean, they would have something like 12 or 13 years to work on it."
23-08-2020T02:53:39,CrRAR,The other aspect of this is the actual human royalty
23-08-2020T02:53:50,Dadrobit,"To be fair, Keidran have not been shown to be decent folk. Easy to make a target of them when they all seem to be assholes."
23-08-2020T02:54:09,Dadrobit,"Spazz, you assume I was not already honors roll"
23-08-2020T02:54:17,CrRAR,Who without the Sythe x Flora relationship now have wars everywhere
23-08-2020T02:54:37,CrRAR,And the power struggles
23-08-2020T02:54:50,CrRAR,Mekkan is a mess xD
23-08-2020T02:55:53,Dadrobit,I suspect the human royalty was already more or less on its way to being the puppet of the Templar while Mary was in charge.
23-08-2020T02:56:38,CrRAR,Yeah it seems like the dynamic is that the royalty work by means of diplomacy
23-08-2020T02:57:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I assumed nothing
23-08-2020T02:57:36,CrRAR,...but yeah then you have Natani/Zen as an example who are career thieves/assassins
23-08-2020T02:57:50,Dadrobit,"Also, Spazz, I've been over-analyzing this mess for well over a decade by now. This is just my default state at this point."

23-08-2020T02:59:33,SpazztasticKiwi,girl was Hyped about the new titanic coming out
23-08-2020T02:59:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"3d, hd"
23-08-2020T02:59:48,Dadrobit,Did someone ruin the ending for her?
23-08-2020T03:00:18,SpazztasticKiwi,some boy got fed up with her going on about it and yelled ‚Äúyou know what here‚Äôs a spoiler - the boat sinks!‚Äù
23-08-2020T03:01:14,CrRAR,Wahwahhhh
23-08-2020T03:01:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I get invested in few things now
23-08-2020T03:02:07,SpazztasticKiwi,most cases nobody cares to hear about it even if they‚Äôre part of the group
23-08-2020T03:06:12,Dadrobit,"brb, gonna make a burrito"
23-08-2020T03:06:26,CrRAR,ok

23-08-2020T03:11:42,CrRAR,Teen social dynamics be scary yo
23-08-2020T03:12:32,CrRAR,Maybe it‚Äôs just that humans weren‚Äôt meant to be packed in with eachother like school does
23-08-2020T03:12:53,SpazztasticKiwi,no it‚Äôs more like the axe forgets but the tree remembers
23-08-2020T03:13:09,SpazztasticKiwi,time don‚Äôt erase shitty behavior
23-08-2020T03:13:38,CrRAR,"Yeah, character often stays the same"
23-08-2020T03:15:59,Dadrobit,"Moderately disagree. I was an asshat in highschool who was VP of the ""Anti-Furry League"" club."
23-08-2020T03:16:25,Dadrobit,I don't think that person then and the person who I am now are even remotely comperable.
23-08-2020T03:17:16,Dadrobit,"Time doesn't erase shitty behavior, but if the rest of the time afterwards is spent being a decent bro, that should absolutely still be taken into account for the person's character no?"
23-08-2020T03:17:56,Dadrobit,"Also, back with burrito"
23-08-2020T03:17:57,SpazztasticKiwi,not if they don‚Äôt care to recognize they were garbage
23-08-2020T03:18:31,SpazztasticKiwi,suddenly being nice and inviting doesn‚Äôt mean you didn‚Äôt spit on me from the top of the gym stairs
23-08-2020T03:18:48,Dadrobit,Is the change in behavior not in and of itself recognition?
23-08-2020T03:19:03,SpazztasticKiwi,not necessarily
23-08-2020T03:19:22,Dadrobit,How do you figure
23-08-2020T03:19:46,SpazztasticKiwi,a girl who was trash to me for years changed when she apologized to my face for all she‚Äôd done
23-08-2020T03:20:01,Dadrobit,"If the behavior changed, something had to have happened where they were like, ""oh shit, I should probably be better"""
23-08-2020T03:20:18,Dadrobit,"So wait, she apologized?"
23-08-2020T03:20:29,SpazztasticKiwi,yes
23-08-2020T03:20:37,Dadrobit,And she changed her behavoir?
23-08-2020T03:20:54,SpazztasticKiwi,yep
23-08-2020T03:20:55,Dadrobit,behavior*
23-08-2020T03:21:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"I knew she‚Äôd changed but when she started seeking out the people she‚Äôd been cruel to and kept up her life change, bingo"
23-08-2020T03:22:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"if you know an action was wrong but just pass it off as in your past, that may be but that person still only knows that version of you"
23-08-2020T03:22:22,SpazztasticKiwi,their memories of you are not who you are now
23-08-2020T03:22:23,Dadrobit,"I ain't saying you should forgive and forget, goodness knows I got folks I'm never letting back into my life regardless of their change, but where's the problem here with that person's current character?"
23-08-2020T03:23:02,SpazztasticKiwi,there‚Äôs no problem with the current character
23-08-2020T03:23:12,Dadrobit,So what's the issue?
23-08-2020T03:23:45,SpazztasticKiwi,they‚Äôve dropped their past without thought for how they effected others when they were horrible people
23-08-2020T03:24:04,Dadrobit,"I mean, they apologized. That's exactly that."
23-08-2020T03:24:12,SpazztasticKiwi,that one girl did
23-08-2020T03:24:26,SpazztasticKiwi,but do you think she was the only one that terrorized me
23-08-2020T03:24:44,Dadrobit,"Nah, I was just saying that folks can change for the better is all."
23-08-2020T03:25:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt care too much what happened anymore but I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôll become friends with any of those I have poor memories with

23-08-2020T13:58:23,PalmettoPathfinder1,You know I wondering if Trace is going to cause a Templar Civil War (oh boy!  Things will be epic!  Maybe it'll spiral out of control and cause a World War!)
23-08-2020T13:58:48,PalmettoPathfinder1,Sorry just saw the Battle of the Five Armies.  :D
23-08-2020T14:02:47,CrRAR,"Yeah, the world already is spiraling out of control. You have a populace largely obviously unhappy with what the Templar are doing (first suspicious of Mary), then swinging completely to a homicidal maniac, so I think the world of Mekkan is just waiting"
23-08-2020T14:03:02,CrRAR,for competent and fair leadership I guess
23-08-2020T14:03:42,CrRAR,They may eventually realize that hatred isn‚Äôt the way
23-08-2020T14:05:54,CrRAR,That seems to largely be influenceing and enabling the Templar but it‚Äôs only making matters worse with their inability to deliver especially with the dysfunction they‚Äôve been witnessing
23-08-2020T14:06:48,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Yeah that's true.  Not to mention, I think things will get so out of control, that not even the dragons AND the Masks can stop it."
23-08-2020T14:07:26,CrRAR,"Yeah, like right now there really is no one person that wants the mantle of Templar leadership"
23-08-2020T14:08:01,CrRAR,They‚Äôre all just power struggling it seems for their own ends I guess not wanting to be ‚Äúthe guy‚Äù xD
23-08-2020T14:08:11,PalmettoPathfinder1,"I mean, if we have Masks and dragons who are both magical entities, there are probably other entities we haven't seen yet. But that's true as well."
23-08-2020T14:09:01,PalmettoPathfinder1,The Templar will basically fall apart and the Human Empire will basically fracture into warring territories.
23-08-2020T14:09:38,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Some Pro-Templar, some Anti-Templar, some Pro-Peace with our Neighbors, others Pro-Kill All Keidran, etc."
23-08-2020T14:09:57,CrRAR,"Yeah, just like they say ‚Äòmoney can‚Äôt buy happiness‚Äô, maybe magic can‚Äôt find it (or peace) either."
23-08-2020T14:10:19,CrRAR,aka it‚Äôs not the answer to governace of a sociey
23-08-2020T14:10:38,CrRAR,"It might be PART of the society, not the way to lead it though"
23-08-2020T14:12:45,PalmettoPathfinder1,And what about those Towers?  Those Towers might be siphoning the magic from Mekkan itself.  And that sort of thing always backfires!
23-08-2020T14:13:36,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Heck I wouldn't be surprised if old Trace (well, paranoid maniacal Trace) created the Towers to actually be some sort of doomsday weapon that destroys well everything including the Masks and the Masks AND dragons are unaware of this."
23-08-2020T14:15:31,CrRAR,He could have grown resentful at them
23-08-2020T14:16:33,CrRAR,"...if that‚Äôs possible to even effect them, I don‚Äôt know if you want to assault the entities setting the rules of the world you‚Äôre living in lol"
23-08-2020T14:17:06,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, that's usually how some doomsday weapons work: they kill everything no matter who you are."
23-08-2020T14:17:19,PalmettoPathfinder1,*or what you are
23-08-2020T14:18:04,CrRAR,"Masks: ‚Äúoh shit, he‚Äôs gonna destroy everything, that maniac, yup time to wipe his memories‚Äù"
23-08-2020T14:18:55,PalmettoPathfinder1,"At that point, wiping his memories is going to be mute. Especially if the memory of how to turn the blasted things off in time to save everyone is buried deep in mind. Wiping his mind a second time might erase that."
23-08-2020T14:20:17,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Plus, Old trace probably became resentful and angry at the world.  Who knows maybe he wanted to destroy everything so that he and Saria (after he brought her back to life) could live out their lives in peace (he and her and their children would be the"
23-08-2020T14:20:22,PalmettoPathfinder1,only living people around)
23-08-2020T14:21:44,CrRAR,"Yeah, sure he could have gona as far as to be pissed at the RULES of the world, beyond just its inhabitants"
23-08-2020T14:23:18,CrRAR,The masks though so far I think said (in their endless power struggle) that the Keidran mask did a memory wipe as a protective measure for the Keidran specifically
23-08-2020T14:26:19,PalmettoPathfinder1,That's true.
23-08-2020T14:26:43,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Come to think of it, the dragons and Masks are basically equal or almost equal in power."
23-08-2020T14:27:00,PalmettoPathfinder1,"From what I recall Tom saying a long time ago, but he might have changed his mind on that."
23-08-2020T14:30:03,CrRAR,It seems to me Dragons live amongst the people and can influence things more directly I guess?
23-08-2020T14:30:26,CrRAR,Like masks seem like they have to manifest and possess folks
23-08-2020T14:30:53,CrRAR,...and can only do so at cost to their strength
23-08-2020T14:31:13,CrRAR,Or at least abilities
23-08-2020T14:32:11,CrRAR,Which Euchre is interesting because early on he seems to mention ‚Äúknowing the rules‚Äù and speaks of ‚Äúbreaking them this one time‚Äù
23-08-2020T14:33:06,CrRAR,I was always unclear about what that entailed
23-08-2020T14:33:07,PalmettoPathfinder1,Hm...Tom did say that there were originally 4 masks but one of them had 'died'
23-08-2020T14:34:03,PalmettoPathfinder1,It's possible the fourth mask might still be alive in some sort of fashion.  Maybe the fourth one's mask form was destroyed but it still existed and merged with Euchre.
23-08-2020T14:34:32,CrRAR,"Yeah, maybe there is a way to ascend to maskhood and the powerful individuals in the world are somewhat competing?"
23-08-2020T14:34:44,CrRAR,Maybe Euchre was just speaking of the rules of the world
23-08-2020T14:34:49,CrRAR,idk
23-08-2020T14:35:19,CrRAR,"Though, masks are also tied to races, so that could indicate a race just died off"
23-08-2020T14:36:34,CrRAR,Imagine someone could make a sacrifice and forfeit their humanity and bonds to contribute to the dominion of the world?

23-08-2020T15:15:16,CrimsonQuill,I left just after the second poll result

23-08-2020T15:18:07,CrRAR,...and Raine got geeked up and gets to geek out
23-08-2020T15:18:43,CrimsonQuill,Wat
23-08-2020T15:18:53,CrimsonQuill,What was that suggestion?
23-08-2020T15:19:07,CrRAR,Raine explains magic
23-08-2020T15:19:20,CrRAR,Tom put her in professor attire

23-08-2020T15:22:44,CrimsonQuill,So I'm going to have to change some stuff

23-08-2020T15:58:39,CrimsonQuill,Going to have to learn
23-08-2020T15:58:40,CrimsonQuill,Fast
23-08-2020T15:59:34,CrRAR,"Yeah, it‚Äôs tough because there‚Äôs lots of ways to say things, it‚Äôs like a battle between proper syntax and taking the character‚Äôs... character into account."
23-08-2020T15:59:55,CrimsonQuill,yep
23-08-2020T15:59:59,CrimsonQuill,But the only way to be better
23-08-2020T16:00:03,CrimsonQuill,is by writing more
23-08-2020T16:00:20,CrRAR,I think Tom has mentioned that he battles himself with the way a given character would say something and specifically what language.
23-08-2020T16:01:41,CrimsonQuill,"Well, he's had 15 years near-full-time experience.."
23-08-2020T16:01:46,CrimsonQuill,I'm doing this as a hobby
23-08-2020T16:03:36,CrRAR,"Yeah, I guess in it‚Äôs purest form you have to think of it as if you were talking as the character yourself."
23-08-2020T16:03:49,CrimsonQuill,Good idea
23-08-2020T16:04:25,CrRAR,"Which is tough because of all the aspects of the characters, their experiences and motivations."
23-08-2020T16:04:45,CrRAR,Plus depends WHO they‚Äôre talking to.

23-08-2020T17:25:46,CrRAR,Raine was once in Samus‚Äô Zero Suit
23-08-2020T17:26:18,CrRAR,It was one of the first painted-style looking things Tom did kinda
23-08-2020T17:26:25,PalmettoPathfinder1,"With me, I'm torn between Adelaide and Natani.  I thought she was in a Halo Spartan armor? But I'm talking about the Samus armor."
23-08-2020T17:26:31,CrRAR,Or mayb ethat was becuse it was a fan color
23-08-2020T17:26:38,CrRAR,Now that I think of it
23-08-2020T17:26:55,CrRAR,"Or a colab, with another artist"
23-08-2020T17:27:12,CrRAR,It was a Vote Incentive I‚Äôm pretty sure a while ago
23-08-2020T17:30:41,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, I know she was dressed up as Master Chief (I know the human Raine was colored for that one) and she appeared as Okami Ammy."
23-08-2020T17:31:23,PalmettoPathfinder1,And she was put in a Star Wars Rebel X-Wing pilot suit.

23-08-2020T19:26:36,Ordithus,ooh non dairy she can be my ice cream wifu
23-08-2020T19:26:38,CrRAR,yes ord lol and unpleasant
23-08-2020T19:26:51,SpazztasticKiwi,nobody said they‚Äôd be edible
23-08-2020T19:27:18,SpazztasticKiwi,we went from fashion to ice crem
23-08-2020T19:27:23,CrRAR,"Karen, mint cookie or something"
23-08-2020T19:27:42,SpazztasticKiwi,karen is probably an empty bowl because she ate it all
23-08-2020T19:27:51,CrRAR,tru
23-08-2020T19:27:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Maddie‚Äôs bowl is missing

23-08-2020T19:29:28,CrRAR,Sneps/Kat could just be cookies and cream but with different toppings maybe
23-08-2020T19:29:52,CrRAR,Maeve totally gets a cheery and some of those other things you mentioned
23-08-2020T19:29:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Kat is the kit kat version of cookies n cream
23-08-2020T19:30:11,CrRAR,I didn't know that existed
23-08-2020T19:30:18,CrRAR,"so, appropriate"
23-08-2020T19:30:33,CrRAR,Rare. breed.
23-08-2020T19:30:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt know if it does but in this day and age nothing is impossible
23-08-2020T19:30:58,CrRAR,believe the unpossible
23-08-2020T19:31:03,CrRAR,new motto
23-08-2020T19:32:37,SpazztasticKiwi,if nat gets purple Keith can have pink
23-08-2020T19:32:55,CrRAR,bubble gum?
23-08-2020T19:33:13,CrRAR,maybe that's Alaric though idk
23-08-2020T19:33:15,SpazztasticKiwi,around that shade yea
23-08-2020T19:33:24,CrRAR,I feel like Alaric needs two flavors
23-08-2020T19:33:41,CrRAR,"one for serious side, and another"

23-08-2020T19:38:03,CrRAR,haha
23-08-2020T19:38:28,CrRAR,Keanu on the bench would also be acceptable
23-08-2020T19:42:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"because Trace has blue in his scheme, I‚Äôd trash the idea of giving Laura and Mike blue - though I will say if I didn‚Äôt I‚Äôd swap the royal blue for cobalt blue"
23-08-2020T19:43:18,SpazztasticKiwi,but when Flora was in that red dress it looked good yes but in a blendy way
23-08-2020T19:43:18,CrRAR,That's a classy blue
23-08-2020T19:43:36,SpazztasticKiwi,it complimented her but didn‚Äôt make anything strike out
23-08-2020T19:44:03,CrRAR,Redorange is a hella awesome - underappreciated - color
23-08-2020T19:44:06,SpazztasticKiwi,so she might go better in a black to match both of them while Laura and mike get cobalt
23-08-2020T19:44:28,SpazztasticKiwi,if we‚Äôre wanting everyone to be different
23-08-2020T19:45:45,SpazztasticKiwi,also I question tehe idea of this debate because none of these people wear clothes
23-08-2020T19:47:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"since we got memes, anybody want me to send my Tom/Mark meme I made sometime last year"
23-08-2020T19:48:57,SpazztasticKiwi,and think about it: Flora in a red/yellow flame dress
