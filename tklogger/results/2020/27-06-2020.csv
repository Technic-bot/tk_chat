27-06-2020T00:00:21,CrRAR,The hints of her being confined to the estate was a freaky enough hint tbh.
27-06-2020T00:00:41,CrRAR,That sucks for real.
27-06-2020T00:01:12,RimaDraws,yea i figured she would be an apparition but not like this...
27-06-2020T00:01:35,CrRAR,Yeah Euchre must know something if he knows she was trapped in the estate
27-06-2020T00:02:21,CrRAR,...and he knows she’s dangerous enough to have hologramm’d in.
27-06-2020T00:02:33,CrRAR,Sheiiiit
27-06-2020T00:03:10,Ordithus,hm?
27-06-2020T00:03:41,RimaDraws,maybe
27-06-2020T00:03:50,CrRAR,Like when he was there he specifically said he knew to keep his distance
27-06-2020T00:04:26,CrRAR,"I think because he knows of Rose’s capabilities, right?"
27-06-2020T00:04:36,CrRAR,"Like, at the estate."
27-06-2020T00:06:42,RimaDraws,maybe he does
27-06-2020T00:07:26,AspiringNoodle,"Maybe he knows that if he went there and she recognized him, she'd tear his [redacted] and [redacted] until he [redacted]"
27-06-2020T00:07:35,RimaDraws,hm
27-06-2020T00:07:36,Ordithus,She isn't doing such a great job keeping old secrets from Trace
27-06-2020T00:07:43,CrRAR,lol
27-06-2020T00:08:04,RimaDraws,nope
27-06-2020T00:08:41,CrRAR,I’m curious do we even know if the Rose Wing is the 3rd Floor room? I’m forgetting.
27-06-2020T00:09:20,Ordithus,Rose Wing?
27-06-2020T00:09:28,CrRAR,The hallway
27-06-2020T00:10:11,Ordithus,Ah.  1105 Trace seems to think they are on the 3rd floor
27-06-2020T00:10:30,CrRAR,"Ah, good"
27-06-2020T00:11:02,Ordithus,I assume Karen and Maddie found it because both are chaos incarnate

27-06-2020T15:31:12,FloofyCat,Could put it in a comic page in the background or something as an easter egg

27-06-2020T15:34:45,Roughlandin,Erilas seems to have a consistent effect on Mike

27-06-2020T15:35:31,Keioboy,uwu i like this x3
27-06-2020T15:35:50,Roughlandin,"Right side of the screen, Raine"

27-06-2020T15:36:25,FloofyCat,I wonder how much this won by.
27-06-2020T15:36:28,Keioboy,*adds Dawaun Parker to my playlist in spotify*
27-06-2020T15:36:38,BlackjackSec99,Floofy. a lot
27-06-2020T15:36:55,FloofyCat,I mean I sure did contribute to the number.
27-06-2020T15:36:57,Zeguider,I recall the fictional world where they all were women.
27-06-2020T15:37:02,Roughlandin,@ComicLuke Context is important. If you're going to have a race of anthro animals also called Keidran. Then I'd avoid just ripping off the name.
27-06-2020T15:37:38,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floraquestion: wonder what books she reads
27-06-2020T15:37:47,Roughlandin,Raine's fanfics
27-06-2020T15:37:52,Rainelover,It’s just buffering on the Maeve portrait sketch for me
27-06-2020T15:37:59,Keioboy,shit i wish i have two mointors right now u.u
27-06-2020T15:38:03,ComicLuke,"worth a try, I'm too stupid to come up with"
27-06-2020T15:38:21,K3IDRAN,I read Myth books and history
27-06-2020T15:38:23,Zeguider,Thats why we got phones... Unless thats just me?
27-06-2020T15:38:56,ShamusTheFox,Purple eyes. Don't see that too often.
27-06-2020T15:38:57,Roughlandin,"@Rainelover: Mad Cuteness, Maid Kat, Hoodie Flora, Laura/Kat at Squirrelmart, and Erilas Sunbathing"
27-06-2020T15:38:57,ComicLuke,"как же сложно на английском общаться, боже"

27-06-2020T15:39:26,ComicLuke,"I know, just joking"
27-06-2020T15:39:34,Rainelover,Soviet spy!
27-06-2020T15:39:34,Ordithus,ironic considering what you just said haha
27-06-2020T15:39:42,jirka,"And damn it, I forgot about someone. Hi Purp"
27-06-2020T15:39:45,ShamusTheFox,Ye Olde English
27-06-2020T15:40:54,ComicLuke,"So, someone have idea, how create name to my race antro-animals?"
27-06-2020T15:41:34,ComicLuke,Im too lazy and dumb for this :D
27-06-2020T15:41:39,KiTA,You could use the standard in Japanese isekai novels
27-06-2020T15:41:41,Twokinds,make something up
27-06-2020T15:41:42,KiTA,"call them ""beastmen"""
27-06-2020T15:41:46,Keioboy,lol
27-06-2020T15:41:51,ShamusTheFox,Depends on if you want something obvioud or unique.
27-06-2020T15:41:56,KiTA,"and ""demi-humans"" for anything humanoid and sentient but not human"
27-06-2020T15:42:01,Keioboy,i find it to be too cliche
27-06-2020T15:42:10,Roughlandin,"Yeah, sorry Luke. But you're gonna have a hard time making a full comic if you aren't creative enough to come up with a name for a fantasy race"
27-06-2020T15:42:11,unsteddyphoenix,just call them furries so easy
27-06-2020T15:42:14,Glassan,Pick an obscure language and butcher a translation. It'll sound unique enough.
27-06-2020T15:42:23,Glassan,"That's what I'd do, at least."
27-06-2020T15:42:24,Roughlandin,Morphs. Anthros. Animalkin
27-06-2020T15:42:35,FloofyCat,Call them Legally Distincteidran™
27-06-2020T15:42:35,Keioboy,it's gotta be unique u.u
27-06-2020T15:42:39,hyneria,you can just even go with the olde beastfolk
27-06-2020T15:43:02,Roughlandin,Walky Doggos
27-06-2020T15:43:13,Rainelover,Yay! Erilas is getting colored! Too bad refreshing didn’t work and it’s still buffering!

27-06-2020T15:47:16,Roughlandin,...Why does everything surrounding Old Trace have to be garbo?
27-06-2020T15:47:39,CrRAR,you could say he did some stuff
27-06-2020T15:47:46,ProsePro7,Cause its Old Trace
27-06-2020T15:47:50,Roughlandin,"Give it 16+ years, Mini. That's all it took, Tom"
27-06-2020T15:48:01,Ordithus,Trace was a baaaad boy

27-06-2020T15:50:03,hyneria,Why would Rose snatch away Maren?
27-06-2020T15:50:11,hyneria,just give Scythe blue balls?
27-06-2020T15:50:16,Ordithus,Anything for her Saria~
27-06-2020T15:50:18,MoonDance,I'd use a Pog meme to react
27-06-2020T15:50:21,ProsePro7,She is probably going haywire
27-06-2020T15:50:21,ShamusTheFox,"Acting on a magical directive, perhaps?"
27-06-2020T15:50:24,hyneria,scythe... damn autocorrect
27-06-2020T15:50:32,CrRAR,lol
27-06-2020T15:50:39,Meowtcha,Probably Trace was scouting Maren to use as a new body for Saria
27-06-2020T15:50:40,CrRAR,*Sythe's eye twitches*
27-06-2020T15:50:41,Roughlandin,"I knew something was funky. It felt like she was in two places at once when she was helping Maddie/Karen, AND talking to Raine"
27-06-2020T15:50:42,BlackjackSec99,sythe*
27-06-2020T15:50:46,BlackjackSec99,lol
27-06-2020T15:51:25,Keioboy,... and with a stroke of Tom's pen he made the ocean appear...
27-06-2020T15:51:32,Keioboy,*.*
27-06-2020T15:51:37,Ordithus,He's gotten some  practice with ocean views
27-06-2020T15:51:42,Roughlandin,The real question left is exactly... how involved Trace was in Rose's... situation.
27-06-2020T15:51:59,ProsePro7,Can we just talk about the pretty white belly for a moment
27-06-2020T15:51:59,ShamusTheFox,Rose seems physical enough...but I can't remember if she could actually touch physical objects.
27-06-2020T15:52:11,CrRAR,She moved the coffeee bowl
27-06-2020T15:52:18,CrRAR,Reni's coffee bowl
27-06-2020T15:52:19,Roughlandin,"And the painting, apparently"
27-06-2020T15:52:20,hyneria,but Trace doesn't want to bring Saria back anymore. Is Rose trying to complete what Past Trace left?
27-06-2020T15:52:24,Ordithus,handled Raine's clothes
27-06-2020T15:52:28,ProsePro7,She picked up the collar that Raine broke
27-06-2020T15:52:28,CrRAR,yeah
27-06-2020T15:52:38,ShamusTheFox,So then Rose is not just a ghost/hologram.
27-06-2020T15:52:58,Ordithus,She also was very genuine with Trace and Raine earlier.  Good hearty laughs
27-06-2020T15:53:00,ProsePro7,And poltergeists can touch things so it doesnt prevent her from being a ghost
27-06-2020T15:53:01,Meowtcha,"I mean, Rose really loved/cared for Saria as well. I wouldn't be surprised."
27-06-2020T15:53:01,Ordithus,And shock
27-06-2020T15:53:28,Roughlandin,Remember when Trace said he wanted the Guardians to be his child's eternal protectors? ...Maybe he did the same thing with Rose. An eternal nanny.
27-06-2020T15:53:29,ComicLuke,Drawing when i watch stream with drawing. BRILLIANT
27-06-2020T15:54:09,MoonDance,Yeah;That's a normal thing to do during streams
27-06-2020T15:54:23,hyneria,Everyone assumes Rose was made into whatever she is against her will
27-06-2020T15:54:29,hyneria,but what if she was on it all along?
27-06-2020T15:54:41,ShamusTheFox,I was considering that.
27-06-2020T15:54:44,Roughlandin,Well she was bound to the manor against her will. That's been confirmed
27-06-2020T15:54:50,Katfeathers,There were earlyer hints that there is a spell involved with Roses current status
27-06-2020T15:54:54,MoonDance,Won't until the next page to reveal
27-06-2020T15:55:06,MoonDance,*Won't know
27-06-2020T15:55:14,ComicLuke,funny that i draw like Tom arts with description my characters
27-06-2020T15:55:28,Roughlandin,"In other news, Black and gold go well with purple! XD"
27-06-2020T15:55:33,ShamusTheFox,But it's fun to speculate!
27-06-2020T15:55:57,Keioboy,Is there any art of tom drawing art?
27-06-2020T15:56:07,hyneria,Mmmm I wonder what would be Eval's reaction to FemMike doing the same as Erilas is doing here
27-06-2020T15:56:14,Roughlandin,...Uh. The Nora one with his tablet?
27-06-2020T15:56:39,Roughlandin,...NVM he's not actually drawn in that one
27-06-2020T15:56:51,CrRAR,"She obviously had to give up certain freedoms and accept being a integrated like ""a spider web"". Maybe she accepted that existence."
27-06-2020T15:57:00,Keioboy,lol someone's gotta do it lol
27-06-2020T15:57:05,CrRAR,She does seem to speak ill of oldTrace's methods though
27-06-2020T15:57:20,CrRAR,"so it's like, at worst ""Eh, it's a living"""
27-06-2020T15:57:21,Roughlandin,I SWEAR there's at least one sketch of Tom sketching something
27-06-2020T15:57:43,ComicLuke,I wish I could sit here for a long time
27-06-2020T15:57:44,Brocade,"Mike's super cute, and I love seeing him in situations like this"
27-06-2020T15:57:44,ArkanaCat,full moon rising mike
27-06-2020T15:57:51,Keioboy,and then litiraly have his hand swipe across paper and an image appear
27-06-2020T15:58:00,ShamusTheFox,Maybe she was nearing the end of her natural life and 'volunteered' for this.
27-06-2020T15:58:10,CrRAR,possibly
27-06-2020T15:58:48,Roughlandin,Knowing Old Trace. I'm thinking the reality of her situation was decidedly more... awful.
27-06-2020T15:59:08,ShamusTheFox,"Here's the thing. The picture had a death date on it. If Trace was insane and uncaring, he wouldn't have bothered putting it on the pic."
27-06-2020T15:59:14,CrRAR,"yeah, having things hidden from her indicates it being a bit more sinister"
27-06-2020T15:59:24,CrRAR,yeah
27-06-2020T15:59:27,Roughlandin,Do we have a year for Saria's death?
27-06-2020T15:59:35,CrRAR,it was on her grave
27-06-2020T15:59:43,Ordithus,477
27-06-2020T15:59:53,CrRAR,nice ord
27-06-2020T15:59:53,Katfeathers,Maybe it was at Saria request
27-06-2020T16:00:04,Roughlandin,449!
27-06-2020T16:00:12,Roughlandin,And Rose died in 480?
27-06-2020T16:00:21,CrRAR,yeh
27-06-2020T16:00:24,hyneria,I don't think this Rose is even the original one
27-06-2020T16:00:31,Roughlandin,Oh nvm that was her birth
27-06-2020T16:00:36,Roughlandin,477

27-06-2020T16:01:48,hyneria,"Isn't the chimera meant to be canon at some point, and be something Trace made?"
27-06-2020T16:01:49,Glassan,"She may be soulbound to the estate. Something that Euchre would probably have known, or even helped set up."
27-06-2020T16:02:11,Roughlandin,"Chimera isn't canon thus far that we know of, Hyn"
27-06-2020T16:02:12,Glassan,I'm pretty sure the chimera isn't canon.
27-06-2020T16:02:20,Kynum,Why can't girls ever do their own backs with sunscreen?! :ptv-angry:
27-06-2020T16:02:21,hyneria,oh

27-06-2020T16:04:13,Glassan,It also fits with Euchre's twisted sense of protecting family.
27-06-2020T16:04:19,Roughlandin,...Then I'll find the boi planet
27-06-2020T16:04:21,CrRAR,A planet with two moons?

27-06-2020T16:09:47,ShamusTheFox,I don't like wearing sandals. My feet always feel like they are going to slip right out of them. Same goes for slippers. Would usually just rather have bare feet.

27-06-2020T19:21:11,ProsePro7,Focus on the tightness of the ass Tom.
27-06-2020T19:21:13,Roughlandin,So she grew and she learned of the evils of pants
