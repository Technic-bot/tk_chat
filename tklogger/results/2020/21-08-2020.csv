21-08-2020T01:44:29,SageSaga,but a lot of the current anime is either meh or just good
21-08-2020T01:44:33,unsteddyphoenix,I wanna wait before starting it
21-08-2020T01:44:44,unsteddyphoenix,Ah so nothin' great out recently. Shame
21-08-2020T01:45:37,SageSaga,Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out is cute and fun
21-08-2020T01:45:46,aeoronwah,I've just been sticking to older stuff
21-08-2020T01:46:19,SageSaga,i started watching an older anime recently- its been horrible
21-08-2020T01:46:34,aeoronwah,oh?

21-08-2020T01:46:56,unsteddyphoenix,Lol that shirt
21-08-2020T01:46:57,SageSaga,but theres this guy named Phil and hes a Dick Knight played by the same voice actor that did Sasuke from Naruto
21-08-2020T01:47:00,unsteddyphoenix,I may enjoy this
21-08-2020T01:47:16,unsteddyphoenix,A...dick knight huh
21-08-2020T01:47:18,SageSaga,and you can tell because hes just doing the Sasuke voice
21-08-2020T01:47:34,SageSaga,a dick knight as in a total dickbag person that is also a knight
21-08-2020T01:47:39,aeoronwah,phil uchiha
21-08-2020T01:47:44,aeoronwah,the dick knight
21-08-2020T01:48:20,SageSaga,"yeah- i just find it funny that someone said ""Hey- you know who would voice this guy named Phil super well? That emo kid that either loves or hates Naruto"""
21-08-2020T01:49:03,SageSaga,the show is practically softcore porn and its terrible
21-08-2020T01:49:09,SageSaga,so im almost done watching it
21-08-2020T01:49:16,SageSaga,:D
21-08-2020T01:49:48,SageSaga,i dont even remember what its called
21-08-2020T01:49:50,SpazztasticKiwi,so aeoronwah is invisible
21-08-2020T01:49:52,aeoronwah,lol
21-08-2020T01:50:00,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao
21-08-2020T01:50:02,aeoronwah,whaaaaa

21-08-2020T01:50:49,SageSaga,i can see ya just fine
21-08-2020T01:51:01,SpazztasticKiwi,cool
21-08-2020T01:51:31,SpazztasticKiwi,& dadro probably didn‚Äôt respond cause I‚Äôd expect it to be work time for him
21-08-2020T01:51:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm distracted by game
21-08-2020T01:52:00,SageSaga,well Kiwi- Stands are from Jojo
21-08-2020T01:52:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"but yea, aeoronwah is invisible here"
21-08-2020T01:52:20,SpazztasticKiwi,oh yea jojo
21-08-2020T01:52:42,SageSaga,what do you mean Aeoronwah is invisible?
21-08-2020T01:53:02,DarthRexKing,But do stands have PERSONA-lity? >W>
21-08-2020T01:53:07,SpazztasticKiwi,can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm interested - I‚Äôve heard the first season you have to work yourself through before it gets good and I can‚Äôt see myself doing that
21-08-2020T01:53:14,SpazztasticKiwi,as in they are invisible on chat
21-08-2020T01:53:15,DarthRexKing,See what I did there?
21-08-2020T01:54:00,SageSaga,well thats silly- the first season of Jojo is great if you like old England stories with vampires and crazyness
21-08-2020T01:54:16,DarthRexKing,Plus the kickass theme song. o3o
21-08-2020T01:54:17,SageSaga,but if its not your thing you can just skip it
21-08-2020T01:54:27,aeoronwah,"oh sage, probably won't catch the stream next week, supposed to be getting married friday"
21-08-2020T01:54:42,unsteddyphoenix,:OO
21-08-2020T01:54:45,aeoronwah,unless something comes up and we have t postpone

21-08-2020T01:55:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"but yeah dude, u is invisible to me"
21-08-2020T01:56:12,SpazztasticKiwi,that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve heard is jojo is boring the first season
21-08-2020T01:56:13,SageSaga,Kiwi- do you need to refresh or do you have Aeoronwah ignored or something?
21-08-2020T01:56:29,SageSaga,you should decide for yourself and watch it Kiwi
21-08-2020T01:56:35,SpazztasticKiwi,or maybe just not particularly good or it doesn‚Äôt quite warm up till the next season
21-08-2020T01:56:37,SageSaga,if it is- just watch another season
21-08-2020T01:56:45,SpazztasticKiwi,he‚Äôs not on my ignored list
21-08-2020T01:56:52,SageSaga,you dont need to watch the different seasons in order
21-08-2020T01:57:02,SageSaga,most stand on their own pretty well
21-08-2020T01:57:03,SpazztasticKiwi,actually I can‚Äôt open my ignored list
21-08-2020T01:57:05,aeoronwah,actually a girl btw spazz lol
21-08-2020T01:57:39,SpazztasticKiwi,tho I‚Äôm also weird with anime - I have one that I have two episodes left and still open to stream on a tab on my phone
21-08-2020T01:58:13,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs been that way for sooo long and I‚Äôve just not managed to sit myself down and finish it even though I started out on it so strong
21-08-2020T01:58:52,SageSaga,what series?
21-08-2020T01:59:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I jump all over media from streaming  anime to a movie to youtube

21-08-2020T01:59:55,SpazztasticKiwi,kakyuriyo bed & breakfast for spirits

21-08-2020T02:02:08,SageSaga,btw Kiwi- how can you tell Aeoronwah is talking when ya say she is invisible? She shouldnt show up at all if you have her ignored
21-08-2020T02:02:20,SageSaga,just because we were responding to her?
21-08-2020T02:02:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"demon guy kidnaps me saying I‚Äôm the collateral for my grandpas debt and I was promised to be said ogre demon guys bride, we‚Äôre about to have a Big Problem"
21-08-2020T02:02:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I can see the conversation in full on safari
21-08-2020T02:02:57,Dadrobit,Back

21-08-2020T02:07:43,SpazztasticKiwi,ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

21-08-2020T02:08:40,unsteddyphoenix,poor babby boy
21-08-2020T02:08:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"since it ‚Äúcrashed‚Äù, I haven‚Äôt been able to talk to really anyone that I was connected to"
21-08-2020T02:09:10,SageSaga,it didnt crash-
21-08-2020T02:09:10,SpazztasticKiwi,tells me I‚Äôm not connected to the person or they‚Äôve blocked me
21-08-2020T02:09:23,SpazztasticKiwi,so
21-08-2020T02:09:27,SpazztasticKiwi,yea
21-08-2020T02:09:37,SpazztasticKiwi,my discord isn‚Äôt very used
21-08-2020T02:09:42,Dadrobit,One of these days I'll be able to speak with both unsteddy and Marv... At the same time even!
21-08-2020T02:10:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I miss your voice tbh
21-08-2020T02:10:13,SageSaga,you can only message people you have added to your friends list- or to people that are set to open that you share a discord channel with
21-08-2020T02:10:15,SpazztasticKiwi,only person that has chatted back is rima
21-08-2020T02:10:22,unsteddyphoenix,have to mentally prepare for that
21-08-2020T02:10:49,Dadrobit,I miss yours
21-08-2020T02:10:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,;-; <3
21-08-2020T02:11:00,SageSaga,since Lann deleted his channel- and i yelled at him for being stupid and doing that-
21-08-2020T02:11:09,SageSaga,its cut off some people
21-08-2020T02:11:21,SpazztasticKiwi,things is still on a break or something but him too though all we do is shoot food pics
21-08-2020T02:11:32,SpazztasticKiwi,he cooks alot
21-08-2020T02:11:48,unsteddyphoenix,Why did it upset you so much sage?
21-08-2020T02:12:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"good looking stuff too, he tried a cordon bleu recipe I sent but it didn‚Äôt come out good he said"
21-08-2020T02:12:12,Dadrobit,:( I miss food channel. I had just baked a cobbler and was gonna post a pic right as lann went and deleted everything
21-08-2020T02:12:21,SageSaga,because he thoughtlessly broke up a chat with no warning making it difficult for others to keep in touch
21-08-2020T02:12:38,SageSaga,forcing others to leave because you leave is a dick move
21-08-2020T02:12:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I talk to maybe two people now since that
21-08-2020T02:12:53,unsteddyphoenix,Well...ok I guess he did do that
21-08-2020T02:13:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder if he‚Äôs tried any more dishes - I should ask
21-08-2020T02:13:03,Dadrobit,This is my only means of chatting with y'all since then...
21-08-2020T02:13:12,unsteddyphoenix,It was pretty outta nowhere from my perspective at least
21-08-2020T02:13:13,aeoronwah,wait what happened
21-08-2020T02:13:14,SpazztasticKiwi,same here really
21-08-2020T02:13:30,aeoronwah,I just got in bad so im back for a couple minutes
21-08-2020T02:13:36,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I thought I'd just been kicked or something."
21-08-2020T02:13:41,SpazztasticKiwi,bed chat good chat
21-08-2020T02:13:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Rima was the one to let me know
21-08-2020T02:13:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I was at work at the time
21-08-2020T02:14:07,SageSaga,one of my friends had an emotional breakdown a few months ago and deleted his discord channel so a bunch of people who only talked to each other using that channel could no longer do so
21-08-2020T02:14:23,aeoronwah,aww
21-08-2020T02:14:35,aeoronwah,thats not good for anyone :(
21-08-2020T02:14:47,SageSaga,he didnt realize he hurt a bunch of people by doing that- so i yelled at him
21-08-2020T02:15:53,SageSaga,perfectly legit reason to yell at someone
21-08-2020T02:16:14,Dadrobit,Perfectly cromulent.
21-08-2020T02:16:14,unsteddyphoenix,Ive been yelled at for less i suppose
21-08-2020T02:17:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw aeoronwah post something but chat refresh got rid of it
21-08-2020T02:17:28,Dadrobit,"Do what I did. Join a security firm, then you can get paid to be yelled at for petty things!"
21-08-2020T02:17:42,SpazztasticKiwi,they might have gotten thrown into another channel when chat demerged
21-08-2020T02:18:15,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I got separated as well"
21-08-2020T02:18:30,SpazztasticKiwi,aeoronwah! whereforarttho
21-08-2020T02:18:38,SpazztasticKiwi,thou?
21-08-2020T02:19:13,Dadrobit,Probably my favorite petty aggression came from delaying a pizza a little bit.
21-08-2020T02:19:29,aeoronwah,im back my internet died!
21-08-2020T02:19:38,SpazztasticKiwi,huzzah
21-08-2020T02:19:38,aeoronwah,fuckin alaska man
21-08-2020T02:19:47,aeoronwah,this place blows
21-08-2020T02:19:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw you post something but it got lost in chat refresh
21-08-2020T02:20:03,Dadrobit,"Lady cursed me out, told me I was less than human, and cursed all my children to be born retarded."
21-08-2020T02:20:15,aeoronwah,yikes
21-08-2020T02:20:19,Dadrobit,She was not a nice lady.
21-08-2020T02:20:22,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúwell at least then they won‚Äôt come out like you‚Äù
21-08-2020T02:20:31,Dadrobit,She still doesn't like me very much.
21-08-2020T02:20:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Nighty night y'all, my last brain cell is tired <3"
21-08-2020T02:20:52,SageSaga,bye bye folks!
21-08-2020T02:20:56,aeoronwah,night marv!
21-08-2020T02:20:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I could be mean and say your only brain cell but I wont

21-08-2020T02:21:59,Dadrobit,"o/ Sage, thanks for the stream"
21-08-2020T02:22:10,unsteddyphoenix,thanks for sage!
21-08-2020T02:24:48,Sclimshady,"Dad, Teddy, Lann says howdy"
21-08-2020T02:24:50,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs been quiet since the channel died
21-08-2020T02:25:14,SpazztasticKiwi,but I‚Äôve been staying on other things
21-08-2020T02:25:29,SpazztasticKiwi,work & youtube & streaming stuff
21-08-2020T02:25:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"ah. well, if streams are done I‚Äôm off to more of that"
21-08-2020T02:26:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I share Sages sentiment
21-08-2020T02:28:27,Dadrobit,Which one?
21-08-2020T02:29:13,Dadrobit,"Oh and sclim, if lann is still there, tell him I love him"
21-08-2020T02:29:47,Dadrobit,"Also, if I see him in Tarkov, I'm going to black out the shit out of his legs at spawn and force him to slow crawl to extract"
21-08-2020T02:31:14,Sclimshady,That is brutal
21-08-2020T02:31:59,Dadrobit,I will do it with only the purest of love in my heart
21-08-2020T02:35:37,SpazztasticKiwi,about the discord and the yelling at lann
21-08-2020T02:35:51,Dadrobit,Yeah
