30-04-2020T20:59:49,SageSaga,there are Toxic and weird people in every fandom - it's important to realize that and just accept that the reverse is also true so its all about what parts you interact with and not judge things based on their worse features
30-04-2020T21:00:11,NezumiYuki,"Well put, Sage!"

30-04-2020T21:03:53,johnnytho,haha
30-04-2020T21:04:15,SageSaga,nah my Fandom is mostly the Anime fandom- and trust me- im far from the weird one in that group

30-04-2020T21:13:32,SageSaga,it is a bad idea- you can just show a picture of a storm trooper and say whoever you want is in it
30-04-2020T21:13:46,Ordithus,":ctwokinds-floraquestion: If a Kat is in a storm trooper suit and no one can see, is she still cute?"

30-04-2020T22:05:37,NezumiYuki,Think it was Kat's spots?
30-04-2020T22:06:32,unsteddyphoenix,I'd guess stripes for 200
30-04-2020T22:06:49,AspiringNoodle,spots for 350 ;)
30-04-2020T22:06:52,IronHorseComics,she looks kinda like a doggo without her spots

30-04-2020T22:19:44,PurpleLemons,yeah a shame AC is canceled but it's for the best
30-04-2020T22:20:37,HighVoltageMayhem,ok before i bail out im gonna leave yall with a good engineering challange - making a kiedran spacesuit
30-04-2020T22:21:09,SageSaga,just make the suit bigger and adjust the feet- done
30-04-2020T22:21:10,Grip,Good night all
30-04-2020T22:21:11,NezumiYuki,Shouldnt' be too much different than an existing modern suit... Just an extra appendage for zee tail.  xD
30-04-2020T22:21:17,SageSaga,gnight Grip take care
30-04-2020T22:21:19,IronHorseComics,didn't Tom already draw one?

30-04-2020T22:21:57,Grip,"Thanks, you all take care too"
30-04-2020T22:23:04,SageSaga,you can just have the tail run down one of the legs in the suit- its not like they are going to sit on it in space
30-04-2020T22:23:46,HighVoltageMayhem,doesnt the helmet need some mods too
30-04-2020T22:24:03,HoverdudeXL,How do you feel now tom?
30-04-2020T22:24:07,HighVoltageMayhem,ears would be kinda crammed in there
30-04-2020T22:24:10,SageSaga,already address that- make it bigger
30-04-2020T22:24:14,KeefMcDerpface,^
30-04-2020T22:24:18,w0lfmare,Sounds uncomfortable
30-04-2020T22:24:21,Ordithus,"maybe a bit bigger for muzzle and ears, but otherwise spheres are good for pressure suits"
30-04-2020T22:24:22,HighVoltageMayhem,true true
30-04-2020T22:25:01,SageSaga,if you have to just make it egg shapped
30-04-2020T22:25:16,steelabjur,"You'd have to move some stuff around in the helmet, so they could hear from the earphones."
30-04-2020T22:25:38,SageSaga,not really- a speaker doesnt have to be in your ear to hear it
30-04-2020T22:26:01,HighVoltageMayhem,they have to be able to move thier jaw for the mic to work effectivly
30-04-2020T22:26:13,SageSaga,again- bigger helmet- already solves that
30-04-2020T22:26:20,IronHorseComics,and I bet the helmet would be big enough to allow the ears to fit just fine
30-04-2020T22:26:34,HighVoltageMayhem,im curious how an egg shape would handle pressure tho
30-04-2020T22:26:41,Ordithus,quite well
30-04-2020T22:26:43,IronHorseComics,"unless you have bunny ears,... or horns/antlers then you might have an issue"
30-04-2020T22:26:51,SageSaga,well its the second best shape next to the sphere-
30-04-2020T22:26:52,Dadrobit,"If you super size it enough, it eventually just becomes a spacecraft"
30-04-2020T22:27:09,Ordithus,bigger yet and it becomes a planet

30-04-2020T22:27:34,Ordithus,it's an anthro space helmet!
30-04-2020T22:27:55,NezumiYuki,That's too big to be an anthro!....
30-04-2020T22:28:05,HighVoltageMayhem,"all that fur acting as insulation, suit ac might need an upgrade"
30-04-2020T22:28:40,SageSaga,shave em first
30-04-2020T22:28:43,Ordithus,space stations gonna need a bigger filter for all that shed fur
30-04-2020T22:28:52,HighVoltageMayhem,thats a little extreme

30-04-2020T22:29:43,Dadrobit,Pls don't peel the furries.
30-04-2020T22:29:46,KeefMcDerpface,"Unless you're a Basitin, they have short fur."
30-04-2020T22:30:04,IronHorseComics,may need to cut off horns and antlers

30-04-2020T22:36:46,PurpleLemons,how do they get the space suit on W0lf
30-04-2020T22:36:48,LogicIsHere,"Wait, why not use a pocket dimension thing, like Nat's bandages, to store the antlers to fit in the helmet, like a headband or something?"
