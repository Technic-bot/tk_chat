16-12-2020T17:46:32,CrRAR,wut
16-12-2020T17:46:45,SpazztasticKiwi,she didn‚Äôt hear him but apparently he was way to excited about the back view he was getting in line
16-12-2020T17:47:07,SpazztasticKiwi,the self checkout  monitor told him to leave

16-12-2020T17:48:20,CrRAR,"no I know, it‚Äôs gross"
16-12-2020T17:49:13,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs been a thing today it seems cause another worker said she was on the floor stocking a bottom shelf & a guy came up effectively sticking her in the corner
16-12-2020T17:49:24,CrRAR,Ugh
16-12-2020T17:49:52,SpazztasticKiwi,he kinda reached around her poking at the stuff on the shelf near her and she said she was thinking ‚Äúlet him grab something he‚Äôs not supposed to....‚Äù
16-12-2020T17:50:17,SpazztasticKiwi,then the guy finally asks her if she can cook because ????
16-12-2020T17:50:30,CrRAR,"yeah not to mention personal space with covid, keep your distance bro"
16-12-2020T17:51:16,CrRAR,probably no doubt intoxicated to some degree ;_;
16-12-2020T17:51:28,SpazztasticKiwi,and she tells him ‚Äúno sir I can‚Äôt cook worth a damn (but I can make a bologna sandwich)‚Äù
16-12-2020T17:51:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not sure about how exactly she said the last part but she did say he scampered off and left her alone after that
16-12-2020T17:52:31,CrRAR,scampered is to innocent a word
16-12-2020T17:52:39,CrRAR,but quite illustrative
16-12-2020T17:52:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a feeling it‚Äôs the same guy that asked if I cooked everything ‚Äúhere‚Äù & gestured to the hot case before asking if I could cook
16-12-2020T17:53:33,SpazztasticKiwi,you are double my age at the bare minimum dude of you don‚Äôt take your creepy ass somewhere else..
16-12-2020T17:53:39,SpazztasticKiwi,if
16-12-2020T17:55:06,CrRAR,yeah like do those sorts just like think themselves such a good catch that like they think girls will just be inviting themselves over and just spontaneously cooking?
16-12-2020T17:55:13,CrRAR,its crazy.
16-12-2020T17:55:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"yes sir I sure can cook, does baby want a pb&j with the crusts cut off"
16-12-2020T17:56:11,CrRAR,Maybe it‚Äôs just their sad mid-life crisis last gasp of their high-school glory days
16-12-2020T17:58:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I know it‚Äôs a pandemic and there‚Äôs nothing to do but weirding out female walmart employees is not a viable hobby
16-12-2020T17:58:42,CrRAR,"What‚Äôs more demented is the they‚Äôre pitching to someone at their place of work, like, why!?"
16-12-2020T17:58:55,SpazztasticKiwi,nor is ‚Äúcan you cook‚Äù a pick up line
16-12-2020T17:59:03,CrRAR,nope
16-12-2020T17:59:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"another weirdo I got: I hum...like, alot"
16-12-2020T17:59:31,SpazztasticKiwi,mostly to myself but of course you can hear me if you‚Äôre in the same area
16-12-2020T17:59:39,CrRAR,People who hum a lot tend to have a lot on their mind.
16-12-2020T18:00:00,CrRAR,It‚Äôs like busy noise to think to or drown out everything else
16-12-2020T18:00:13,SpazztasticKiwi,and on occasion I start and don‚Äôt always realize it when I start
16-12-2020T18:00:24,CrRAR,Like your own personal white noise
16-12-2020T18:00:44,SpazztasticKiwi,well I started one day while putting this guys lunch plate together and he says ‚Äúyou sing? do you sing in the shower?‚Äù
16-12-2020T18:00:49,CrRAR,or just got some plague of a song stuck in your head
16-12-2020T18:00:53,SpazztasticKiwi,the humming stopped
16-12-2020T18:01:02,CrRAR,wooooow
16-12-2020T18:01:16,SpazztasticKiwi,and my brain had a record scratch moment
16-12-2020T18:01:59,CrRAR,"It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúWhere are we going with this, because unless you won yourself some sort of trophy for shower singing I‚Äômma bout to call security‚Äù"
16-12-2020T18:02:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to know how and why he thought to make that correlation so quick
16-12-2020T18:02:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"I used to sing in church, in choir"
16-12-2020T18:03:27,SpazztasticKiwi,and I him to entertain myself while I‚Äôm otherwise occupied because that radio will drive you batty
16-12-2020T18:03:31,SpazztasticKiwi,hum
16-12-2020T18:04:10,CrRAR,"yeah, the repetitiveness of songs on modern radio is just bad"
16-12-2020T18:04:38,CrRAR,Plus we are on week like 5 of christmas music season so that‚Äôs stale
16-12-2020T18:04:46,SpazztasticKiwi,the garbage constant covers of all the Christmas songs is gonna kill me
16-12-2020T18:05:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"if I hear santas coming to town by one more singer, I‚Äôm decking his halls when he does"
16-12-2020T18:05:33,CrRAR,Yeah I notice that with radio that more stations even of their regular music has started playing either Covers or Live versions of songs
16-12-2020T18:05:51,CrRAR,gotta be cuz it‚Äôs cheaper
16-12-2020T18:07:53,CrRAR,"You could been like ‚Äúyeah I learned singing in church group, I could sing you something to purify that perv soul you got‚Äù"
16-12-2020T18:08:17,CrRAR,but really I can‚Äôt believe these folks ticked UP around the holidays
16-12-2020T18:08:54,SpazztasticKiwi,the time of giving so maybe it‚Äôs time to start giving people bibles
16-12-2020T18:09:09,CrRAR,haha
16-12-2020T18:09:11,SpazztasticKiwi,or hitting them with bibles

16-12-2020T21:43:42,CrRAR,yeah cuz the alternator will charge a depleted battery a little bit

16-12-2020T21:55:02,CrRAR,yeap
16-12-2020T21:55:41,CrRAR,most countries are mandating electric vehicles by like 2030
16-12-2020T21:56:05,CrRAR,"GB did it, Cali set it as state law"
16-12-2020T21:58:10,CrRAR,the only thing that kills me about a sedan that costs that much is you could buy a truck or SUV and have so much more capability
16-12-2020T21:58:46,CrRAR,"course, no gas but ehhh"
16-12-2020T21:59:21,CrRAR,gas really isn't a super expensive cost of ownership thing
16-12-2020T21:59:38,CrRAR,not enough to justify tesla prices
16-12-2020T22:00:24,Ordithus,"yeah, right now just the depreciation on something like that would cost me more than my car in total"
16-12-2020T22:00:39,CrRAR,I really kinda wish they just bump up the all-electric range somehow on something like the prius prime
16-12-2020T22:00:51,CrRAR,like enough for a decent commute
16-12-2020T22:01:12,CrRAR,course no performance there though xD
16-12-2020T22:01:31,CrRAR,but they do now have eAWD
16-12-2020T22:01:56,CrRAR,back wheels work when you need more traction
16-12-2020T22:02:04,Ordithus,but then you're driving a PRIUS
16-12-2020T22:02:14,Ordithus,yeah that eAWD is pretty nifty
16-12-2020T22:02:31,CrRAR,:cw0lfmare-EmberSad: yup
16-12-2020T22:02:53,Ordithus,it's not plugin but the new honda insight is pretty nice looking

16-12-2020T22:03:09,CrRAR,they are pretty sharp
16-12-2020T22:03:21,Ordithus,I want one in hatchback
16-12-2020T22:03:32,CrRAR,yeah even the Prius Prime I don't personally like the idea of dual powertrain
16-12-2020T22:03:35,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-natsducky: but it doesn't exist
16-12-2020T22:03:51,CrRAR,"like, one or the other, the weight is wasted and make it cumbersome"
16-12-2020T22:04:12,CrRAR,so yeah that's why I'd probably consider a Leaf before the others if I had to
16-12-2020T22:04:23,CrRAR,other tan a Tesla obvs
16-12-2020T22:04:41,Ordithus,VW is coming out with a whole lineup
16-12-2020T22:05:15,SpazztasticKiwi,what‚Äôs it mean  when the ignition eats the key
16-12-2020T22:05:27,Ordithus,um what
16-12-2020T22:06:15,SpazztasticKiwi,the ignition took the key
16-12-2020T22:06:20,CrRAR,like did it snap off?
16-12-2020T22:06:23,SpazztasticKiwi,it won‚Äôt give it back
16-12-2020T22:06:24,CrRAR,or did it lock?
16-12-2020T22:06:29,Ordithus,stuck in the ignition
16-12-2020T22:06:39,CrRAR,you turned the wheel all the way to the right?
16-12-2020T22:06:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm gonna go with it‚Äôs lovked
16-12-2020T22:06:58,CrRAR,that's typical wheel-lock function
16-12-2020T22:07:27,CrRAR,"you have to like put pressure on the sterring wheel in the direction of the ""lock"" and wiggle the key"
16-12-2020T22:07:46,CrRAR,I think
16-12-2020T22:08:17,CrRAR,are you sure it's just not in removal position?
16-12-2020T22:08:50,CrRAR,"dang car, eating keys, batteries"
16-12-2020T22:08:54,SpazztasticKiwi,what exactly is removal position
16-12-2020T22:09:16,CrRAR,anything other than the accessories modes or start xD
16-12-2020T22:09:24,Ordithus,I don't remember if a dead battery and stuck key could be related
16-12-2020T22:09:34,CrRAR,could be that seems crazy though
16-12-2020T22:12:33,CrRAR,"yeah there is an article that says a dead battery can cause that, but also the steering wheel lock and being not in park"
16-12-2020T22:13:09,Ordithus,just don't force it. broken is way more of a headache
16-12-2020T22:13:12,CrRAR,"I always thought that mechanism was mechanical, not related to battery power... weird"
16-12-2020T22:13:28,SpazztasticKiwi,well it coughed up the keys
16-12-2020T22:13:29,CrRAR,yeah don't do any more than wiggling it
16-12-2020T22:13:33,CrRAR,oh nice
16-12-2020T22:13:35,SpazztasticKiwi,then we tried cranking it again
