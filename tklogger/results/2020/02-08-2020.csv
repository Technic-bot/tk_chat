02-08-2020T00:00:12,AspiringNoodle,I basically play no live service multiplayers (primarily shooters) because they lock so much stuff behind multiple forms of monetization
02-08-2020T00:00:39,AspiringNoodle,I'm looking forward to buying Modern Warfare for the campaign
02-08-2020T00:00:45,AspiringNoodle,But the multiplayer can suck it ;)
02-08-2020T00:00:46,SpazztasticKiwi,let those who care to spend their money do so then
02-08-2020T00:01:08,AspiringNoodle,"Kiwi, the problem is that by letting companies get away with so much crap, they've pushed the envelope to a ridiculous degree"
02-08-2020T00:01:21,AspiringNoodle,Oblivion was ridiculed for its horse armor DLC
02-08-2020T00:01:42,AspiringNoodle,"For something like $3, you unlocked cosmetic armor (with gameplay altering buffs) for your horse mounts"
02-08-2020T00:01:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt make a habit of concerning myself with stupid
02-08-2020T00:01:52,SpazztasticKiwi,people or otherwise
02-08-2020T00:01:59,AspiringNoodle,I love games
02-08-2020T00:02:11,AspiringNoodle,I don't love how publishers are looking to nickel and dime you for anything they can
02-08-2020T00:02:16,SpazztasticKiwi,they pull you down to their level and beat you with experience
02-08-2020T00:02:26,AspiringNoodle,"I can gaurantee if they could charge you real-world money for every single bullet you fired in a shooter, they would"
02-08-2020T00:02:49,Ordithus,it'd be a lot more realistic!
02-08-2020T00:02:55,AspiringNoodle,"that's for sure, lmao"

02-08-2020T00:06:13,AspiringNoodle,Part of the reason I rail against Battle Pass systems is that I don't like how far AAA games are going to squeeze money out of customers
02-08-2020T00:06:27,AspiringNoodle,"It's no longer about making a profit, it's about milking as much cash as humanly possible"
02-08-2020T00:06:43,Ordithus,um
02-08-2020T00:07:07,AspiringNoodle,At least indie devs are nice~

02-08-2020T01:20:48,AspiringNoodle,The Herald Curved Greatsword combo is ridiculous...
02-08-2020T01:21:09,AspiringNoodle,Dark Souls 3 is a prime example of how hard it is to balance a game when there's so much going on
02-08-2020T01:33:47,SpazztasticKiwi,a wheel of emmentaler cheese is $1900
