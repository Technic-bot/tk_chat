15-02-2020T00:00:59,AspiringNoodle,"My parents have good jobs, or had, the one is retired, the other's worked at an insurance company for decades"
15-02-2020T00:02:02,AspiringNoodle,"When I try talking to them about this, I usually get responses along the lines of, ""Well, then the company is making bad decisions."" Or, ""That's their problem."""
15-02-2020T00:02:12,AspiringNoodle,But it's like... these problems are really fucking widespread.
15-02-2020T00:06:03,JojoF2415,Time to play Minecraft
15-02-2020T00:06:56,JojoF2415,I had forgotten that I found 6 diamonds
15-02-2020T00:10:05,AspiringNoodle,*sigh*
15-02-2020T00:10:09,AspiringNoodle,I think I need to quit my job soon
15-02-2020T00:10:13,AspiringNoodle,It just pisses me off...
15-02-2020T00:10:29,CrRAR,"Yeah, jobs be dumb sometimes"
15-02-2020T00:10:43,CrRAR,Lack of reward is the worst
15-02-2020T00:10:46,AspiringNoodle,I know I basically consented to working 4 day weeks until we fill
15-02-2020T00:10:55,AspiringNoodle,But I don't want to work there more than 3 days out of pure necessity
15-02-2020T00:11:24,AspiringNoodle,The job constantly switches between stressful to boring to draining
15-02-2020T00:11:45,AspiringNoodle,"The only times I ever enjoy working there and get refreshed is when it's slow and a regular comes in, because those moments are delightful"
15-02-2020T00:12:16,CrRAR,Mmmhm
15-02-2020T00:15:57,CrRAR,My efforts mostly are in making things better for people but there are times I can‚Äôt provide the ideal solution due to preexisting conditions funding/vision... so I just try to make the best of it and differences where I can.
15-02-2020T00:17:14,CrRAR,It‚Äôs tough when your in a situation when an option you‚Äôre used to having is prohibited because it isn‚Äôt budgeted or seen as a valuable way to do things.
15-02-2020T00:17:21,CrRAR,*you‚Äôre
15-02-2020T00:18:40,CrRAR,"Then in becomes, well alright I‚Äôll do this the dumb way that takes 3x as long despite it being super easy if we just had more spare equipments."
15-02-2020T00:19:09,CrRAR,...like EVERY other dept I‚Äôve worked in has EVER had.
15-02-2020T00:20:50,CrRAR,"Puts you as an employee on the spot more frequently, and is tough to express to your ‚Äúcustomers‚Äù why the work you do seems so frustrating."
15-02-2020T00:21:12,CrRAR,‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because no one in their RIGHT MIND would be doing it this way!‚Äù
15-02-2020T00:21:32,CrRAR,‚Äú...and yet here we are!‚Äù
15-02-2020T00:22:14,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:
15-02-2020T00:23:33,CrRAR,It‚Äôs almost like the jobs would be better off with a dumber person that didn‚Äôt know anything could work any better. xD
15-02-2020T00:24:08,CrRAR,...and so an Idiocracy was born‚Äôd.
15-02-2020T00:26:15,AspiringNoodle,Part of the frustration is also my own
15-02-2020T00:26:22,AspiringNoodle,My other job has me working twice a month for about 4 hours
15-02-2020T00:26:28,AspiringNoodle,Today is the day I'm supposed to be doing stuff
15-02-2020T00:27:00,AspiringNoodle,"But I've procrastinated, I woke up late, and I haven't really started AND I have work tomorrow on a day I normally have off / put in my availability as ""not available"""
15-02-2020T00:27:37,AspiringNoodle,"If he would just fix the app so it respected start days, I wouldn't HAVE to do the updates on the 15th and final days of every month"
15-02-2020T00:28:34,AspiringNoodle,"Instead, I could just do them on one of the two days I'm guaranteed to have off"
15-02-2020T00:29:02,AspiringNoodle,"Long story short, I value my free time more than working at a gas station, lol"
15-02-2020T00:29:16,AspiringNoodle,Especially since the company doesn't seem to care enough to keep equipment working ;P
15-02-2020T00:34:40,AspiringNoodle,OMGOMGOMGOMG

15-02-2020T01:14:33,AspiringNoodle,"All because I refuse to do the work first thing when I wake up, and get sucked into leisure activities all day >_>"

15-02-2020T16:11:40,ThingsAreMoving,What spices or herbs will you be using with it?
15-02-2020T16:11:58,Ordithus,"Butter, salt, pepper.  I'm simple."
15-02-2020T16:12:55,ThingsAreMoving,Never tried it as simple as this. Gotta do it one day.
15-02-2020T16:13:05,ProsePro7,Did Tom over sleep again?
15-02-2020T16:13:07,Roughlandin,Yeah pork's pretty easy so long as you get the temperature right. The problem is so many people overcook it and it winds up tasting like an eraser
15-02-2020T16:13:14,BadFoMo,@ProsePro7 Yep.
15-02-2020T16:13:21,Roughlandin,Tom got exactly as much sleep as he needed
15-02-2020T16:13:30,CrimsonQuill,There is a monster inside of me. Clawing at my mind. My existence. My life.
15-02-2020T16:13:33,ProsePro7,(SIGH)

15-02-2020T16:13:56,ThingsAreMoving,o/ Quill
15-02-2020T16:13:59,CrimsonQuill,Because I am the monster.

15-02-2020T16:15:01,Roughlandin,But soon is stream time!
15-02-2020T16:15:02,Combak,"Hi Prose, Crimson, Rough."

15-02-2020T16:15:14,BadFoMo,But the week has just begun!
15-02-2020T16:15:31,Roughlandin,Depends on which day you consider the first day of the week
15-02-2020T16:15:32,ThingsAreMoving,"FoMo, what timezone are you in?"
15-02-2020T16:15:45,CrimsonQuill,@BadFoMo ...You're right-Sunday is the first day of the week!

15-02-2020T16:17:13,CrimsonQuill,I like how Raine's ears popped back up after the Proposal.

15-02-2020T16:17:58,BadFoMo,@Roughlandin Yeah! All other streams from here on; all down hill.
15-02-2020T16:17:59,Rolley,I think that was the k-9 hearing hearing the oncoming storm

15-02-2020T16:18:25,Ordithus,Flora's purr is a 6.9 on the richter scale

15-02-2020T16:20:20,ThingsAreMoving,yes
15-02-2020T16:20:21,FloofyCat,Bailey?
15-02-2020T16:20:23,ProsePro7,A Raine Storm

15-02-2020T16:20:54,CrimsonQuill,I drew a banhammer Battle during a stream as a promis
15-02-2020T16:20:58,Combak,Only you know Quill.
15-02-2020T16:21:01,ThingsAreMoving,I think most people don't get the references Quill.

15-02-2020T16:25:06,CrimsonQuill,I shall art on then.
15-02-2020T16:27:03,Roughlandin,I've got like a dozen half finished or half begun stories sitting on my harddrive collecting dust. I need to work on writing smaller.
15-02-2020T16:27:27,CrimsonQuill,I've gone back to my Doctor-Who/Star Trek fanfic

15-02-2020T16:28:49,Roughlandin,My latest one is kind of inspired by the Tiger explorer sketches. Loosely. It's not set in the TK universe or anything.
15-02-2020T16:29:04,Roughlandin,Basic story of human meets furry tribe. Pretty generic
15-02-2020T16:29:49,CrimsonQuill,Well
15-02-2020T16:30:12,CrimsonQuill,My fanfic is basically...I'll just say lots of death.

15-02-2020T17:41:45,BluePhantom90,right it is a Keidran wedding so there could be 2-5 females merrying the Human males
15-02-2020T17:41:59,Roughlandin,Technically you marry the tribe. The process is both incredibly long and very enjoyable
15-02-2020T17:42:00,CrRAR,gotta stay comfyclassy
15-02-2020T17:42:08,ThingsAreMoving,Bathrobes are the best

15-02-2020T17:45:44,TeapotOfDoom,can't argue with that logic
15-02-2020T17:45:45,RileyTheRiolu,my goals are a lot more clear than before. I still want to be a 3D animator. I could possibly use it for game development.

15-02-2020T20:04:06,Twokinds,I may need to call it early
15-02-2020T20:04:08,PalmettoPathfinder1,"You know I think Twitch rarely has this problem of course, majority of people use Twitch to stream games.  Not a lot of interest to do art."

15-02-2020T20:27:32,Roughlandin,So the last three will be Tom picks right?
15-02-2020T20:27:39,Mediawatcher,Has this happened before to this level?
15-02-2020T20:27:45,PalmettoPathfinder1,I'm still seeing Tom working on Sythe's legs.
15-02-2020T20:27:47,Katfeathers,"as Primogen says, tech happens"

15-02-2020T20:28:02,Roughlandin,Yeah should we just do the last poll?
15-02-2020T20:28:02,Ordithus,He's had to cancel the stream for picarto before
15-02-2020T20:28:06,Mediawatcher,I‚Äôve seen some lag before but never this bad
15-02-2020T20:28:07,FenceEqualizer,Oh well. Thanks for the streams Tom. Was fun while it lasted.

15-02-2020T20:28:14,Dadrobit,"Yeah, Picarto runs on hamster powered dumpster fire servers, so it happens every once in a while."
15-02-2020T20:28:20,CrRAR,"okay, good stuff"
15-02-2020T20:28:22,Mediawatcher,Picarto really needs to update
15-02-2020T20:28:31,falangie123,why doesnt tom stream on twitch or something?
15-02-2020T20:28:32,FenceEqualizer,Yeah never seen picarto be this uppity. Someone needs to feed their hamster.
15-02-2020T20:28:35,unsteddyphoenix,"eh fair enough, thanks for streaming!"
15-02-2020T20:28:49,TypoMichail,"Hello, people, how much time do you have now?"
15-02-2020T20:28:51,PalmettoPathfinder1,Apparently Twitch has strict rules on what can be streamed.
15-02-2020T20:28:59,Ordithus,Eh?  I dunno if he's done streaming.  Pretty sure he's just done with the sketch.  He always finishes ref sheets later
15-02-2020T20:29:00,FloofyCat,Twitch's ToS.
15-02-2020T20:29:04,Roughlandin,Welcome to the end of the stream Typo
15-02-2020T20:29:17,Roughlandin,The stream is dead. Long live the stream
15-02-2020T20:29:17,SpazztasticKiwi,and I had me a ü•ó ü•™ for snackin

15-02-2020T20:29:23,Mediawatcher,"Yeah it‚Äôs not working for me, I‚Äôm still on buffering"
15-02-2020T20:29:29,FloofyCat,"Terms of Service on Twitch goes hard against anything risque and anything, well, it's kinda arbitrary."
15-02-2020T20:29:32,TypoMichail,Cool

15-02-2020T20:29:55,PalmettoPathfinder1,It buffers about every 2 minutes for me.
15-02-2020T20:29:57,BadFoMo,Dang.
15-02-2020T20:29:58,Mediawatcher,Especially compared to other stuff
15-02-2020T20:30:02,Roughlandin,It's what TWITCH would call it that matters
15-02-2020T20:30:03,Katfeathers,"aye, we might loose out on stuff if Tom left Picarto and some others like Fluff don't realy have the alternative"
15-02-2020T20:30:07,FenceEqualizer,Have a feeling Tom's art wouldn't fly over at twitch. Or rather the fan service stuff wouldn't fly.
15-02-2020T20:30:22,Roughlandin,Plus all Tom's art friends are here

15-02-2020T20:31:09,CrRAR,I think it would end if he cut it
15-02-2020T20:31:17,unsteddyphoenix,stream the rest over discord!

15-02-2020T23:48:36,CrRAR,...and wing shape is different but not drastically probably on those maplers.
