21-11-2020T16:22:35,Roughlandin,I've never actually played D&D. I'd probably play bard though lol

21-11-2020T16:23:15,ThingsAreMoving,Well I'm never buying his products again if that's the way he treats his employees

21-11-2020T16:24:44,ThingsAreMoving,"I try to read that sentence but it escapes my ability to interpret it, Prose."
21-11-2020T16:24:47,Roughlandin,"Very true, Prose. Nobody bosses Tom but Tom... and Nora"
21-11-2020T16:24:58,CrimsonQuill,"Aww, not even Christmas day for you Tom?"

21-11-2020T16:25:02,Rainelover,What if Tom has a boss who is also named Tom?
21-11-2020T16:25:04,SpazztasticKiwi,but Nora is also a part of Tom
21-11-2020T16:25:05,NezumiYuki,gaddammit Nora!
21-11-2020T16:25:21,SpazztasticKiwi,so does that mean Tom has two internal bosses

21-11-2020T16:27:34,Roughlandin,Shh. I think Ord missed it
21-11-2020T16:27:46,SpazztasticKiwi,because every time the manager steps out to do something everybody turns to me for direction
21-11-2020T16:27:50,TheSexyBeast,"Oh man, that hit the spot! I hope I can stay awake now, lulz"
21-11-2020T16:28:13,ProsePro7,Drinking my ice cold black coffee to stay awake right now
21-11-2020T16:28:14,ThingsAreMoving,I'll be getting my pay review in January. Depending on the outcome I might need to start searching for some other place to work
21-11-2020T16:28:17,Glassan,"Oh, spaz, that just means ya dun played yourself."
21-11-2020T16:28:19,NezumiYuki,"Beast, if you're asking that, then you need more Zzzz"
21-11-2020T16:28:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not the boss folks - unless you’re climbing the walls or walking on the ceiling what you do is not my concern
21-11-2020T16:28:28,ThingsAreMoving,Which would suck cause that would mean another moving.

21-11-2020T16:30:26,Avolendi,I'm guessing that meant in half an hour (something something timezones)

21-11-2020T16:31:46,Rainelover,I am random foolishness incarnate
21-11-2020T16:31:50,TheSexyBeast,o/ Brocade
21-11-2020T16:32:01,Glassan,"Oh Rough, so far, you have only been B grade Tomfoolery."
21-11-2020T16:32:13,tehbear,Tomfoolery is the best
21-11-2020T16:32:22,Roughlandin,"Excuse you, I am a straight C student"
21-11-2020T16:32:28,Rainelover,Pootis
21-11-2020T16:32:34,NezumiYuki,"Semi silly but also semi serious question:  How do Time Zones when Daylight saving is in effect?  I never had to deal with that, because Hawaii... So to this day I still have trouble remembering how to convert.  I just thank Goog, DuckGo, and Bing for"
21-11-2020T16:32:37,NezumiYuki,converting for me.  xD
21-11-2020T16:33:15,Roughlandin,"Yuki, I've living with Daylight savings for 28 years and I can honestly say I STILL don't know..."
21-11-2020T16:33:23,Glassan,"Standard time just subtracts an extra hour from UTC for all states in CONUS, except Arizona."
21-11-2020T16:33:26,TheSexyBeast,"🎵 clippin' toenails, marking time, doo dah, doo dahhh... 🎵"
21-11-2020T16:33:35,Roughlandin,I just change the clocks to what the internet says
21-11-2020T16:33:43,Glassan,"Because Arizona said ""F*** WORK"" and threw that part out."
21-11-2020T16:34:00,Glassan,"And that is why computers have a mountain time zone, and an Arizona time zone,"
21-11-2020T16:34:15,Roughlandin,"But think of the farmers, Glassan? What about the b e a n s?"
21-11-2020T16:34:28,NezumiYuki,Ya know what... I think it's high time the US just uses Zulu / UTC already... I mean common this is 2020 already...  Easier on the brain!
21-11-2020T16:34:31,Glassan,Sun still rises at the same relative time.
21-11-2020T16:34:42,Avolendi,"On the nothern hemisphere, winter time is the default. Summer time is the DST, which is +1 hour. Doesn't get applied everywhere at the same time though"
21-11-2020T16:35:09,Glassan,That it does not.
21-11-2020T16:35:12,Roughlandin,All I know is it is currently 4:35 Eastern and the sun is already setting...
21-11-2020T16:35:37,Rainelover,"Daylight savings time was created so farmers had more time to farm, Arizona doesn’t farm, therefore no daylight savings time"
21-11-2020T16:35:46,tehbear,"at the end of the day, the sun is all that matters"
21-11-2020T16:35:54,ThingsAreMoving,It's 9:35 PM here and the sun's been gone for quite a while now
21-11-2020T16:35:57,Glassan,DST has been extended so long now that there's less than 1/3rd of the year thats in Standard time in the US
21-11-2020T16:35:59,Roughlandin,Praise the sun!
21-11-2020T16:36:02,Ordithus,it was for factory production in ww2
21-11-2020T16:36:07,NezumiYuki,LOL Rough!
21-11-2020T16:36:09,TheSexyBeast,Why don't they schedule DST around the equinoxes?
21-11-2020T16:36:13,Ordithus,use more of that daylight for a second shift
21-11-2020T16:36:30,tehbear,joins Rough in Praisal
21-11-2020T16:36:32,NezumiYuki,Solair wants everyone to Praise the SUN!
21-11-2020T16:36:47,Glassan,"Or just use a globalized time measurement, since so much communication is global now."
21-11-2020T16:36:53,Roughlandin,Anybody fork out 700 bucks for Demon Souls remake?
21-11-2020T16:37:04,Glassan,o_O
21-11-2020T16:37:19,NezumiYuki,Glass... Globalized Time is what the Military has been using for decades now... Zulu or UTC
21-11-2020T16:37:19,Glassan,Who likes suffering that much?
21-11-2020T16:37:22,TheSexyBeast,I don't know of any farmers that rely on DST
21-11-2020T16:37:25,tehbear,"nah, its a troll game. always was. i prefer legend of zelda"
21-11-2020T16:37:28,Avolendi,"If I recall correctly, DST is just about shifting the time we use by an hour in summer, so we have more daylight to enjoy (since most people's effective days are more into the evening than mornings"
21-11-2020T16:37:39,Roughlandin,"People who play Soulsborne games, Glassan"
21-11-2020T16:37:48,ThingsAreMoving,"Sorry Rough, the only game I'll be spending my monies on in the near future is Cyberpunk 2077"
21-11-2020T16:37:54,Roughlandin,"Same, Things"
21-11-2020T16:37:54,Avolendi,Pretty sure DST is opposite to what would help farmers in the morning?
21-11-2020T16:38:01,Glassan,dun played themself
21-11-2020T16:38:30,Roughlandin,Still waiting to get my hands on an RTX 30XX series card just to play Cyberpunk
21-11-2020T16:38:38,ThingsAreMoving,Good luck with that
21-11-2020T16:38:46,Glassan,"And true, militaries, scientists and computer communications have been on UTC/Zulu time exactly as a result of that globalization."
21-11-2020T16:38:48,Rainelover,"Yes, however farmers got more use out of it, so it was kept even after ww2 ended because of them"
21-11-2020T16:38:52,Roughlandin,Think Santa's gonna leave me an I Owe You
21-11-2020T16:38:59,ThingsAreMoving,I read the soonest they're going to be available is March
21-11-2020T16:39:41,tehbear,Cyberpunk or RTX 30xx?
21-11-2020T16:39:43,ThingsAreMoving,Let me rephrase that. The soonest the preorders all around the world will be realized is around mid March
21-11-2020T16:39:44,Roughlandin,Oh they're coming in. Newegg gets two or three ever week. They sell out in about 5 seconds
21-11-2020T16:39:55,tehbear,oh. RTX i guess
21-11-2020T16:40:04,Roughlandin,Eyup
21-11-2020T16:40:08,Avolendi,"Basically for a local area, 12 o'clock in the afternoon should be when the sun is at its highest. And with society working mostly 9-5, shifting those hours can get weird"
21-11-2020T16:40:46,ThingsAreMoving,"My friend managed to get an 3070, he showed it on a PC building forum and people there offered him nearly 200% of what he paid for it"
21-11-2020T16:40:55,ThingsAreMoving,that's how desperate people are for these cards
21-11-2020T16:40:57,Glassan,Wow.
21-11-2020T16:40:59,Avolendi,Dang
21-11-2020T16:41:05,Roughlandin,Not I. I'll wait lol
21-11-2020T16:41:09,Avolendi,^
21-11-2020T16:41:14,AspiringNoodle,*sigh*
21-11-2020T16:41:15,Snowmanwizard,i'll stick with my 2070 super
21-11-2020T16:41:24,AspiringNoodle,It's dumbdumbs like that why scalpers are so successful...
21-11-2020T16:41:29,AspiringNoodle,People these days have 0 patiences
21-11-2020T16:41:31,ThingsAreMoving,I'll be able to play the game at high settings and that's enough for me
21-11-2020T16:41:36,Roughlandin,I'm gonna run my 970 into the ground first
21-11-2020T16:41:39,AspiringNoodle,I also have a 2070 super :D
21-11-2020T16:41:48,ThingsAreMoving,"I was raised on ATARI and ZX Spectrum games,, I can handle some pixels"
21-11-2020T16:41:49,AspiringNoodle,...and I had a 970 before that :ptv-laugh:
21-11-2020T16:41:49,Glassan,I still haven't found anything that my 1080 Ti still can't reasonably handle.
21-11-2020T16:41:57,Avolendi,Also since I'll probably be getting a laptop version (and curious to compare with AMD to get a better frame of refence).
21-11-2020T16:41:57,Glassan,"At least, not that I want to play."
21-11-2020T16:42:04,tehbear,970 is still pretty usable for many games
21-11-2020T16:42:07,AspiringNoodle,My PC is more or less set
21-11-2020T16:42:09,Avolendi,Got a 970m :P
21-11-2020T16:42:19,ThingsAreMoving,"\o Noodle, missed ya there"
21-11-2020T16:42:26,AspiringNoodle,I'll upgrade my GPU / CPU in 2 - 3 generations
21-11-2020T16:42:40,Snowmanwizard,"i built my pc a couple months ago, was wating for the new 30 series but decided to go ahead with the 2070"
21-11-2020T16:42:41,AspiringNoodle,And then it should be set until the next major improvements
21-11-2020T16:42:52,Avolendi,"I'm curious, but in no hurry (stuff still runs surprisingly well)"
21-11-2020T16:42:58,NezumiYuki,"I can see where if you're a twitch gamer or vtuber streamer that needs the most graphical processing, paying that much for an Uber card doesn't sound stupid..."
21-11-2020T16:42:59,Roughlandin,"Same, avo"
21-11-2020T16:43:11,NezumiYuki,but for the average user... nope that B Dum!
21-11-2020T16:43:13,Glassan,"And even with all the money, the bleeding edge dulls quickly."
21-11-2020T16:43:22,Roughlandin,"Like I said, only think I'd need a 3070 for is Cyberpunk"
21-11-2020T16:43:22,AspiringNoodle,My 2070 super is a Gigabyte Gaming OC.  And I managed to squeeze an extra 75mhz core and 750mhz memory :D
21-11-2020T16:43:40,Avolendi,"I like it when it dull, that's when you get a good price/quality (and no issues with supplies)"
21-11-2020T16:43:50,Avolendi,+s
21-11-2020T16:43:55,ThingsAreMoving,I upgraded into a 3900X Ryzen and 32GB DDR4 ram so I think I'll be ok with them for a few years
21-11-2020T16:44:07,AspiringNoodle,"But seriously, the people willing to pay 2 - 3x the MSRP of a card because they have 0 patience are why we're in this position in the first place"
21-11-2020T16:44:20,Ordithus,"some of my pc is from '11, built it for skyrim"
21-11-2020T16:44:26,Ordithus,did upgrade a lot a few years back
21-11-2020T16:44:32,AspiringNoodle,"Scalpers are scummy, but they understand supply and demand.  Also 3700X represent~"
21-11-2020T16:44:34,ThingsAreMoving,That's peak capitalism Noodle
21-11-2020T16:44:34,Ordithus,but... due for an upgrade
21-11-2020T16:44:50,Roughlandin,I just upgraded from an intel i5 4460 to a amd 3600
21-11-2020T16:45:00,AspiringNoodle,"My PC was cutting edge a year ago, lol"
21-11-2020T16:45:04,Avolendi,Only ever added 8G more memory
21-11-2020T16:45:12,AspiringNoodle,"Not the highest end components, but everything was the latest gen of hardware"
21-11-2020T16:45:38,AspiringNoodle,"X570, 3rd series ryzen, super series Nvidia, gen 4 pcie NVME"
21-11-2020T16:45:56,ThingsAreMoving,"I guess my next upgrade will be for VR, which I still consider not developed enough to get into"
21-11-2020T16:46:09,ThingsAreMoving,Maybe in another tow generations
21-11-2020T16:46:13,ThingsAreMoving,two*
21-11-2020T16:46:16,Roughlandin,Only thing I'd be interested playing in VR is Squadrons
21-11-2020T16:46:27,TheSexyBeast,"I need a new computer, but a tablet fills all but my gaming needs."
21-11-2020T16:46:53,AspiringNoodle,X570 is seriously overbuilt for what 3rd gen needed
21-11-2020T16:47:06,Roughlandin,Oh! That reminds me! I finally beat Witcher 3!
21-11-2020T16:47:16,AspiringNoodle,It'll probably be a good fit for 5000 or later.  I hope to upgrade to the last AM4 generation of CPUs
21-11-2020T16:47:41,Roughlandin,I've started playing it like 4 times and finally sat down and finished it recently lol
21-11-2020T16:47:42,ThingsAreMoving,"Yeah I got the x570 plus, too"
21-11-2020T16:47:49,AspiringNoodle,"Who knows what'll be out by then.  How many cores, how many threads? xD"
21-11-2020T16:47:50,ThingsAreMoving,best in this price range
21-11-2020T16:47:54,NezumiYuki,"LOL before I'd even think about trying VRChat, I first gotta mess around with Blender and learn it.   What's the sense of VRing if I don't have my own virtual FurSuit?   xD"
21-11-2020T16:48:20,AspiringNoodle,What you got?  I got the Aorus Master
21-11-2020T16:48:26,ThingsAreMoving,Nezumi at least you have your priorities sorted out
21-11-2020T16:48:41,Roughlandin,I have the B550 version of the Master
21-11-2020T16:49:26,NezumiYuki,"My only lingering question... is...  Normal Yuki the Nezumi, or Skaven Yuki?   xDD"
21-11-2020T16:49:33,AspiringNoodle,I wonder what generation of GPU / CPU will be out when the last generation of AM4 ryzenis released...
21-11-2020T16:49:41,NezumiYuki,I'm thinking skaven but... not sure yet.
21-11-2020T16:49:43,AspiringNoodle,"Skaven, for extra depravedness"
21-11-2020T16:49:48,NezumiYuki,XDD
21-11-2020T16:49:52,ThingsAreMoving,Make both
21-11-2020T16:49:53,AspiringNoodle,is an agent of chaos.
21-11-2020T16:49:59,ThingsAreMoving,Pick one depending on mood
21-11-2020T16:50:15,Roughlandin,"Skaven Yuki make good chat thing, yes YES!"
21-11-2020T16:50:27,NezumiYuki,Yeah but...
21-11-2020T16:50:40,NezumiYuki,Skaven Yuki more easily falls victim to LEWD
21-11-2020T16:50:53,CrRAR,:cw0lfmare-EmberTooHappy:
21-11-2020T16:51:26,AspiringNoodle,lurks to eat Arby's and play WoW
21-11-2020T16:51:31,AspiringNoodle,*hiss hiss*
21-11-2020T16:51:37,NezumiYuki,LOL LOL
21-11-2020T16:51:54,Avolendi,Blender is great :) Messing around with it on and off. Mostly keep coming back to an oversized spaceship I had upgraded to include the inside ^^;
21-11-2020T16:51:55,Roughlandin,The combo of champions
21-11-2020T16:51:56,AspiringNoodle,I'm watching Markimoo play Sign of Silence
21-11-2020T16:52:14,AspiringNoodle,Blender is awesome~
21-11-2020T16:52:25,Roughlandin,I just watched him test Amazon flashlights
21-11-2020T16:52:29,NezumiYuki,Oh yeah that's right... Not that Unus is over... He's back to gaming.  xD
21-11-2020T16:52:31,AspiringNoodle,"I need to find the sculpting tools again... I messed around with them before and made a thing, but they overhauled the entire UI"
21-11-2020T16:52:39,NezumiYuki,now that unus is over*
21-11-2020T16:52:44,Roughlandin,He needed Eef to sing him the Disclaimer Song
21-11-2020T16:52:47,ThingsAreMoving,I'm trying to learn blender. Currently following a nice tutorial on youtube made by CrossMind studio
21-11-2020T16:53:21,Avolendi,Still planning to try and get a small part into UE4 with textures and collision volumes (the ship is sort of mostly done)
21-11-2020T16:53:44,Avolendi,Donut tutorial and other stuff from BlenderGuru is what I can advise
21-11-2020T16:53:56,Roughlandin,I am a simple bear. The only thing I know about computers comes from this one I stole out of the trash.
21-11-2020T16:54:02,ThingsAreMoving,"Will look into that, too."
21-11-2020T16:54:34,Glassan,"Surely it's a fine computer, Rough. After all, the secret ingredient..."
21-11-2020T16:54:34,BadFoMo,"I think I would like to get into using Blender, but last time I ckecked, it went over my head."
21-11-2020T16:54:37,Glassan,Is crime.
21-11-2020T16:54:38,NezumiYuki,"Whatcha wanna do with that ship, Avolendi?   Port and mod it into Star Citizen or Elite Dangerous?"
21-11-2020T16:54:44,AspiringNoodle,I once tested how many subdivision surfaces on a default sphere it would take to exceed 32GB of ram
21-11-2020T16:54:48,AspiringNoodle,"I think it was 7, lol"
21-11-2020T16:55:20,ThingsAreMoving,that kills the memory
21-11-2020T16:55:34,Roughlandin,Sphere is stronk
21-11-2020T16:55:37,CrimsonQuill,"Oh crumbs, just finished the intro for Halo 4 on PC....the nostalgia!"
21-11-2020T16:55:40,AspiringNoodle,"And FoMo, Blender is a super powerful tool, and it's definitely a great free animation / modeling program"
21-11-2020T16:55:47,CrimsonQuill,starts humming 117 ost
21-11-2020T16:55:50,AspiringNoodle,"User friendliness, on the other hand, is not its strong suite xD"
21-11-2020T16:56:03,AspiringNoodle,"That said, maybe the new UI was meant to make it easier to use"
21-11-2020T16:56:22,Roughlandin,I like to use my blender to make smoothies
21-11-2020T16:56:27,Avolendi,"Kinda want to try and get it into UE4 in total and make it into a place you can run around in. Should that work, I can extend it from there."
21-11-2020T16:56:53,AspiringNoodle,"Alright, I lurk for reals now"
21-11-2020T16:56:58,ThingsAreMoving,There are twokinds of blenders Rough.
21-11-2020T16:57:02,ThingsAreMoving,Both of them fun
21-11-2020T16:57:05,NezumiYuki,User Friendly and Blender =/=  not by a long shot!  xD   If anyone has used any other 3D app or suite before and then jumps right into Blender... They gonna LOOSE IT!  xD
21-11-2020T16:57:06,Avolendi,I'm not that much into modding and not sure how much details I should change/add to get it to load into an existing game
21-11-2020T16:57:07,BadFoMo,Maybe I should look into it later. I have found memories of playing with Google SketchUp.
21-11-2020T16:57:23,Roughlandin,Lurk quick Noodle. Stream start ETA 3 minutes
21-11-2020T16:57:25,CrRAR,I now have grapes
21-11-2020T16:57:29,CrRAR,and soup!
21-11-2020T16:57:32,ThingsAreMoving,\o/
21-11-2020T16:57:38,ThingsAreMoving,what kind of soup?
21-11-2020T16:57:48,NezumiYuki,NO SOUP FOR YOU
21-11-2020T16:57:50,CrRAR,classic chicken noodle
21-11-2020T16:57:57,NezumiYuki,Mmm chimken!
21-11-2020T16:58:04,Avolendi,You want to get some basic tutorials and go through them step by step. It's too big to just randomly expect to get good at
21-11-2020T16:58:08,ThingsAreMoving,Were you trying to buy clothes and ended up in soup?
21-11-2020T16:58:16,CrRAR,...it's a bad month to be birds...
21-11-2020T16:58:26,NezumiYuki,All I see is soup!
21-11-2020T16:58:38,CrRAR,:stew:w:stew:
21-11-2020T16:58:41,Roughlandin,"And a good month to be Roughs. Birds beware, Rough's here for a scare"
21-11-2020T16:59:00,CrRAR,Roughs get to feast and then sleep
21-11-2020T16:59:04,CrRAR,sounds nice
21-11-2020T16:59:09,ThingsAreMoving,"Imagine evolving from dinosaurs to birds, just to be considered tasty as hell"
21-11-2020T16:59:09,Glassan,yum
21-11-2020T16:59:31,Glassan,Dinosaurs were probably tasty too.
21-11-2020T16:59:34,Avolendi,"A good point of Blender to somewhat offset the dauntingness of it's size and complexity, is that there's lots of tutorials"
21-11-2020T16:59:38,Glassan,At least if gator is any indication.
21-11-2020T16:59:45,CrRAR,they have endured...
21-11-2020T16:59:48,Roughlandin,The rest of this winter shall consist of intermittant bouts of feating and hibernation. It will be GLORIOUS
21-11-2020T16:59:50,CrRAR,to be DELICIOUS!
21-11-2020T16:59:56,Glassan,Yus

21-11-2020T17:56:40,BaskervilleNQH,I remember that the front page when I found the comic was Zen getting stabbed by Keith.
21-11-2020T17:56:41,Glassan,"Well, Karen at least got what she asked for, after Maddie erased her ears."

21-11-2020T17:56:58,Tharkis,15 years ago the project i worked on had about a 1 hour build time

21-11-2020T17:57:04,CrRAR,the first time or the remake/recall Baskerville?

21-11-2020T17:57:11,Tharkis,"so when i was done making changes, i'd kick off a build and read comics for an hour"
21-11-2020T17:57:24,BaskervilleNQH,The first time.

21-11-2020T17:59:04,Avolendi,"I have no clue how long I've been reading TK, but for a bunch of years. Not sure if 5+ or 10+ -.-"
21-11-2020T17:59:06,Tharkis,"it's one of the only webcomics from 15 years ago that is still going lol.   Kevin and Kell is still going,   Missfile ended it's run a couple years back, the wotch updates in spurts and pieces"

21-11-2020T17:59:35,ThingsAreMoving,Baskerville I think there are several people here who frequent those
21-11-2020T17:59:40,falangie123,i think i found TK on topwebcomics in like 2016
21-11-2020T17:59:41,Tharkis,i started reading that around the same time as i started reading TK
21-11-2020T17:59:57,falangie123,"i was confused, 'why is this comic always #1'??"
21-11-2020T18:00:03,Tharkis,"""maren, maren, look!  i've got beans!"""
21-11-2020T18:00:04,BaskervilleNQH,Wouldn't be surprised. TK was absurdly popular over there.

21-11-2020T18:00:07,ShamusTheFox,Some webcomics are so long that it's hard to jump into it from the beginning. Like Freefall.
21-11-2020T18:00:08,falangie123,turns out theres a good reason lol
21-11-2020T18:00:16,Glassan,"For some reason, I'm thinking back to 'Surviving the World'."
21-11-2020T18:00:17,CrRAR,oh yes
21-11-2020T18:00:22,ThingsAreMoving,I think my first webcomic was Freefall
21-11-2020T18:00:25,Glassan,"Not so much a comic, but still was fun to read."
21-11-2020T18:00:26,CrRAR,with the fence?

21-11-2020T18:00:48,Dimensional,"The way the ""human"" teeth are shown in her mouth, it looks like she's actually a squirrel or shipmunk. XD"
21-11-2020T18:00:50,CrRAR,she was very ploofy
21-11-2020T18:00:55,Dimensional,Or a beaver.

21-11-2020T18:01:26,Avolendi,You want retardly long? Only webcomic I didn't get through the backlog when stuck reading it was Sluggy Freelance. Took 4 tries or so.
21-11-2020T18:01:55,ShamusTheFox,"Sluggy I stopped reading about 8, 9 years back."
21-11-2020T18:02:00,Glassan,"Ooof, yeah, reading through all of that is almost a project in itself."
21-11-2020T18:02:05,ShamusTheFox,Just lost interest

21-11-2020T18:02:44,Glassan,"It is, but somehow doesn't take as long to get through, for me."
21-11-2020T18:02:47,BaskervilleNQH,Of all the webcomics I started reading when I was young. 2K is the only one I've stuck with.
21-11-2020T18:03:03,TheSexyBeast,achewood was another
21-11-2020T18:03:17,Roughlandin,"Only other long term webcomics I kept up with were Druids, which ended earlier this year, and Housepets, which I've lost track of"
21-11-2020T18:03:30,Avolendi,Read that as well. Might have been having a period of reading webcomics instead of doing gaming or such. Turns out those can keep me up late as much or even worse than gaming
21-11-2020T18:03:40,ThingsAreMoving,Rough :ctwokinds-reniembarrassed:
21-11-2020T18:03:42,BaskervilleNQH,Housepets rings a bell.
21-11-2020T18:03:51,ShamusTheFox,I still follow Housepets. Couldn't tell you the names of all the characters though.
21-11-2020T18:04:01,Ordithus,there's only a milion of them
21-11-2020T18:04:02,ProsePro7,I'm still on housepets
21-11-2020T18:04:05,falangie123,my first webcomic was sins venials
21-11-2020T18:04:09,CrimsonQuill,I have a problem
21-11-2020T18:04:15,Roughlandin,I still follow Rick's FA page but I couldn't keep up with Housepets
21-11-2020T18:04:20,falangie123,think its still going with a different name
21-11-2020T18:04:20,Avolendi,You may not be the only one Crimson :P
21-11-2020T18:04:22,Jirka,I'd like her to have a tail like Nyna's. It would look nice.
21-11-2020T18:04:24,ProsePro7,Craig and Draige are good ones but yeah it is a cast of millions now
21-11-2020T18:04:26,CrimsonQuill,So clip paint has a 'panels' tool
21-11-2020T18:04:29,Rainelover,"I have 23 different pages open on safari, and almost all of them are webcomics"
21-11-2020T18:04:32,CrimsonQuill,But it's hard as wood to use
21-11-2020T18:04:39,Ordithus,kitty :ptv-excited:
21-11-2020T18:04:40,CrimsonQuill,Should I draw panels?
21-11-2020T18:04:40,Glassan,"My first web-comics were Bob & George, followed by 8-bit theatre."
21-11-2020T18:04:48,BaskervilleNQH,"Clip paints panels tool is a little combersome, yeah"
21-11-2020T18:04:51,ProsePro7,Speaking of comics Beastars just finished in Japan
21-11-2020T18:05:33,falangie123,i dont really like the art style of beastars
21-11-2020T18:05:35,BaskervilleNQH,"Spend a few moments to just toy about with the panels tool, CrimQuil."
21-11-2020T18:05:43,CrimsonQuill,Aheheh
21-11-2020T18:05:43,Roughlandin,I still need to finish the anime on Netflix
21-11-2020T18:05:48,CrimsonQuill,Weeelll
21-11-2020T18:05:49,ShamusTheFox,"I hear a lot of people didn't like how the series was resolving, but I have no idea what the plot is aside from the first three books."

21-11-2020T18:06:01,CrimsonQuill,I just sketched out a little halo comic page
21-11-2020T18:06:03,ProsePro7,Yeah it ends in a really dumb way
21-11-2020T18:06:07,CrimsonQuill,and it be ready for ink
21-11-2020T18:06:09,Avolendi,"Next time, Karen in the aftermath or wreaking havoc, snoozing in a patch of sun :)"
21-11-2020T18:06:18,CrimsonQuill,But me no know how put panels on
21-11-2020T18:06:19,ProsePro7,I wont spoil it but it is just ridiculous
21-11-2020T18:06:29,NezumiYuki,Yeah Beastars character styling is... well... it's unique for sure
21-11-2020T18:06:32,Avolendi,Cool :o
21-11-2020T18:06:35,CrRAR,and can hide from responsibilities in highest places
21-11-2020T18:06:49,Avolendi,"Crimson, you putting those somewhere specific? I'm curious :)"
21-11-2020T18:07:02,BadFoMo,I check out AI and Inherit The Earth. I use to also check out DreamCatcher until is stoped and got rebuted as a visual novel.
21-11-2020T18:07:03,Roughlandin,Oh wait. I was thinking of Brand New Animal. I haven't finished that either
21-11-2020T18:07:08,CrimsonQuill,@Avolendi Putting what somewhere specific?
21-11-2020T18:07:21,Avolendi,What you're making?
21-11-2020T18:07:26,BlackjackSec99,BNA needs moar
21-11-2020T18:07:27,ShamusTheFox,I read and played Inherit The Earth.
21-11-2020T18:07:55,Roughlandin,Michiru is :heart:
21-11-2020T18:07:57,BaskervilleNQH,BNA had a pretty satisfying conclusion~
21-11-2020T18:08:01,CrimsonQuill,@Avolendi It's another little Halo thing with my OCs (and Raine making an appearence)...basically they're meeting another OC from the community.
21-11-2020T18:08:16,Tharkis,poke the beans
21-11-2020T18:08:21,CrimsonQuill,I'm playing around with ideas to see how I want to write my comic.
21-11-2020T18:08:22,Tharkis,:ctharkis-paw:
21-11-2020T18:08:37,CrimsonQuill,I want  to at least start it properly over the next year.
21-11-2020T18:08:44,BlackjackSec99,"good grief, this one is cute! shes just SO excited!"
21-11-2020T18:08:49,CrimsonQuill,Till then I'm just doodling whatever comes into my head.
21-11-2020T18:08:56,Ordithus,she knows she's adorable
21-11-2020T18:08:59,Avolendi,Do you post these WIPs somewhere or just for personal practise?
21-11-2020T18:08:59,ShamusTheFox,I have mixed feelings about BNA. I didn't like it as much as Beastars. But I appreciate what it is.
21-11-2020T18:09:03,Roughlandin,Karen is excite
21-11-2020T18:09:04,CrimsonQuill,And yes...Karen looks beautiful!#

21-11-2020T18:09:32,CrimsonQuill,"@Avolendi Well, I do put some stuff on Twitter and Deviantart sometimes..."
21-11-2020T18:09:40,CrimsonQuill,But Cat Karen takes priority atm

21-11-2020T18:42:03,CrRAR,ooo that's a pretty dress already
21-11-2020T18:42:13,CrimsonQuill,Has anyone ever crossed her and lived?
21-11-2020T18:42:16,NezumiYuki,I'm okay with a Nora multiverse
21-11-2020T18:42:20,Roughlandin,We've been giving Tom a lot of super involved sketches this month
21-11-2020T18:42:25,ThingsAreMoving,I feel like this is a very complicated suggestion.
21-11-2020T18:42:27,Glassan,Nora only wears the height of fashion
21-11-2020T18:42:29,CrimsonQuill,"At least, when she was at her current stage of power."
21-11-2020T18:42:29,CrRAR,...maybe as a wee critter Crimson
21-11-2020T18:42:35,Roughlandin,"Agreed, Things"
21-11-2020T18:42:36,CrRAR,:mouse2:
21-11-2020T18:42:49,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah pretty ambitious
21-11-2020T18:42:50,CrimsonQuill,"Would anyone be able to cross Nora as she is now, and escape somewhat unscathed?"
21-11-2020T18:42:56,unsteddyphoenix,Like many suggestions in one
21-11-2020T18:43:00,DarthKeidran,Congrats tigerwarrior1998!
21-11-2020T18:43:00,CrimsonQuill,Given that she's more powerful than the masks?
21-11-2020T18:43:04,unsteddyphoenix,Prooobably not? Dont think anyones that powerful
21-11-2020T18:43:05,CrRAR,yeah this will be pretty epic
21-11-2020T18:43:09,unsteddyphoenix,I dont think shes more powerful than the masks though
21-11-2020T18:43:18,Roughlandin,"In times of doubt, Nora has always been able to lean on herself"
21-11-2020T18:43:21,unsteddyphoenix,But she can somewhat stand up to them
21-11-2020T18:43:21,Ordithus,similar power I think
21-11-2020T18:43:31,Glassan,She most likely only seems to be because she's not constrained by the same rules the masks are.
21-11-2020T18:43:32,ThingsAreMoving,"If I remember right, Masks can't influence her in her Dragon form"
21-11-2020T18:43:38,BadFoMo,Why has the idea of multiple Noras reminded me of the ending of Bioshock Infinite?
21-11-2020T18:43:51,Roughlandin,All roads lead to Nora
21-11-2020T18:43:53,ThingsAreMoving,"that's why Nora doesn't take human or keidran forms, that would cause her to fall under their influence"
21-11-2020T18:43:56,CrimsonQuill,I believe that the Masks are not responsible for creating any races at all.
21-11-2020T18:44:16,Rainelover,"In Nora’s mind, the best dress is no dress at all"
21-11-2020T18:44:19,Glassan,Totally not because she still can't figure out how to stand properly on two legs.
21-11-2020T18:44:20,CrRAR,beeg Nora snoot
21-11-2020T18:44:21,CrimsonQuill,I think they're just parasitic demon-like creatures that came and called dibs on the races that already existed.
21-11-2020T18:44:29,Dimensional,Biped Nora leaning on Normal Nora's head? XD
21-11-2020T18:44:31,BadFoMo,Nora = Anna and Trace = Booker?
21-11-2020T18:44:37,CrimsonQuill,"Basically, they say they made life...but they didn't,"
21-11-2020T18:44:43,CrimsonQuill,I like to think that anyway.
21-11-2020T18:44:44,Dimensional,The many forms of Nora talking amongs themselves.
21-11-2020T18:45:02,Roughlandin,I give this five minutes before all the Noras start fighting over who's in charge...
21-11-2020T18:45:04,ThingsAreMoving,"Well, it was suggested they had the power to enable cross breeding between humans and keidran"
21-11-2020T18:45:11,CrRAR,lol
21-11-2020T18:45:14,CrimsonQuill,Eeeeeeeh...
21-11-2020T18:45:23,ThingsAreMoving,So they have *some* control over life
21-11-2020T18:45:38,CrimsonQuill,I just have a soft spot for the underdogs being able to literally flip the bird at the gods...
21-11-2020T18:45:45,Glassan,I had taken it to read they were just implementing some magical birth control
21-11-2020T18:45:51,CrimsonQuill,It's something I picked up from Discworld.
21-11-2020T18:45:52,Glassan,And stopped after Neutral broke.

21-11-2020T20:53:35,ShamusTheFox,What's even more impressive is that the gate was locked and Brutus forced it open with sheer strength and enthusiasm
21-11-2020T20:53:43,DarthKeidran,"Need a follow up where the gate broke the flawless mana crystal, and we see Brutus reunited with “Clovis’ sister”."
21-11-2020T20:53:44,Folfy,I guess Clovis didn't realize how fully dense Brutus was

21-11-2020T23:30:26,Twokinds,"We didn't do any competition in that, just went skiing."
21-11-2020T23:30:27,Roughlandin,They called him Slope Shreddin' Tom
21-11-2020T23:30:36,Twokinds,Downhill.
21-11-2020T23:30:40,Dimensional,How can you ski across the country? I didn't know we have a ramp that big.
21-11-2020T23:30:41,Ordithus,whee
21-11-2020T23:30:42,Dimensional,Or that long
21-11-2020T23:30:44,CrRAR,oh that's the most fun
21-11-2020T23:30:45,unsteddyphoenix,As opposed to skiing uphill
21-11-2020T23:30:48,BadFoMo,What kind of 'Merican skool has a ski team?!
21-11-2020T23:30:50,CrRAR,racing aiieeeeee
21-11-2020T23:30:58,Twokinds,We went to nothern Kentucky for that. Just across the border from Cinci
21-11-2020T23:30:59,Roughlandin,We had a ski club at my school
21-11-2020T23:31:01,w0lfmare,Only the best of the best skii uphill
21-11-2020T23:31:05,ThingsAreMoving,"Gotta ski uphill if you want to ski downhill, unfteddy"
21-11-2020T23:31:07,Ordithus,"I went downhill, once. Nearly tore my leg off"
21-11-2020T23:31:15,Roughlandin,Pizza... French fries...
21-11-2020T23:31:17,KeefMcDerpface,ouch]
21-11-2020T23:31:48,KeefMcDerpface,"Was it a tree or a fench, Ord?"
21-11-2020T23:31:56,KeefMcDerpface,fence
21-11-2020T23:32:02,Ordithus,Nothing nearly so dramatic
21-11-2020T23:32:13,Roughlandin,"I went on a school ski trip like once. I took an inner tube down one slope, got snow in my pants, then spent the rest of the trip drinking hot cocoa in the lodge"
21-11-2020T23:32:23,Roughlandin,So... good time!
21-11-2020T23:32:26,ThingsAreMoving,How do you nearly tear your leg off in a non dramatic way?
21-11-2020T23:32:43,unsteddyphoenix,No you get the

21-11-2020T23:32:58,Roughlandin,As Ord does with all things
21-11-2020T23:32:59,KeefMcDerpface,Good... For you??
21-11-2020T23:33:04,BadFoMo,Why do I get the feeling that if I joined a school ski team (while I was still in school) it would just be playing SkiFree?
21-11-2020T23:33:10,Ordithus,I was standing still :ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:

21-11-2020T23:35:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve yet to spend so much as a day where there’s decent snow on the ground
21-11-2020T23:35:46,SpazztasticKiwi,let alone try skiing
21-11-2020T23:36:14,Roughlandin,"I live in the ""sometimes it snows and everyone panics and forgets how to drive"" area of the country"
21-11-2020T23:36:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t relish the idea of two chopsticks on my feet in Christ knows how much white bs
21-11-2020T23:36:25,Ordithus,Where I live it's 6 months of winter
21-11-2020T23:36:31,KeefMcDerpface,luck
21-11-2020T23:36:35,CrRAR,"I ordered my pass today, so, hopefully have some decent snows here"
21-11-2020T23:36:39,Blackironwolf,Same here
21-11-2020T23:36:49,Blackironwolf,Snow wise
21-11-2020T23:36:51,Roughlandin,Oh we get winter. Always winter... but it never snows... and it's never Christmas
21-11-2020T23:36:51,Folfy,Where i live it snows in the middle of April but not in December
21-11-2020T23:37:04,CrRAR,like statistically hopefully this winter is a little eventful
21-11-2020T23:37:08,Katfeathers,It was nice when I was much much younger to get up to the snow
21-11-2020T23:37:10,Ordithus,Only two months has this town never seen snow: July and August
21-11-2020T23:37:17,Blackironwolf,We get snow on any month of the year lol
21-11-2020T23:37:17,CrRAR,wow
21-11-2020T23:37:24,Ordithus,"I've seen it in late May, personally. And early October"
21-11-2020T23:37:25,ThingsAreMoving,two months with no snow?
21-11-2020T23:37:28,johnnytho,When I first snowboard I couldn't brake so I would just flop on my stomach and roll about 20x every time I went down the bunny hill. People were not happy.
21-11-2020T23:37:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"around here, people see frost and it’s like the sky is falling"
21-11-2020T23:37:42,Folfy,Oof
21-11-2020T23:37:44,CrRAR,My opinion is that if it's gonna be cold enough to it might as wll snow
21-11-2020T23:37:46,Ordithus,Heck I've seen ice on the lake in JUNE
21-11-2020T23:37:49,Roughlandin,We had a freeze on Memorial day this year
21-11-2020T23:37:57,Roughlandin,Killed my garden. Mah poor beans
21-11-2020T23:38:05,ThingsAreMoving,Holy hell Ord. No wonder you're so proficient at shoveling it

21-11-2020T23:38:59,Katfeathers,"Well, stubborn tomatoes ftw"
21-11-2020T23:39:07,ThingsAreMoving,UK had public transport shut down entirely after ~10 inches of snowfall
21-11-2020T23:39:09,Roughlandin,Tomato plants are surprisingly cold hardy
21-11-2020T23:39:13,ThingsAreMoving,a few years back
