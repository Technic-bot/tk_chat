19-12-2020T14:15:10,TerraTheWizard,blue raspberry is a flavour that doesn't make sense
19-12-2020T14:15:38,TerraTheWizard,mainly because the blue part is meaningless
19-12-2020T14:16:00,tehbear,"yet, its different from red raspberry"
19-12-2020T14:16:13,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s a flavor that doesn’t actually exist
19-12-2020T14:16:22,SpazztasticKiwi,yet everybody knows it
19-12-2020T14:17:47,TerraTheWizard,"the difference is completely placebo too, which is fun"
19-12-2020T14:17:59,TerraTheWizard,because brains have preconceptions of what blue tastes like
19-12-2020T14:22:15,Ordithus,or that red is supposed to taste cherry
19-12-2020T14:25:15,Ordithus,"hmm would Sarah actually be like ""Oh no, she's le naked! Scandal!"" :cw0lfmare-EmberHide:"

19-12-2020T14:41:52,SpazztasticKiwi,or was that Maren
19-12-2020T14:42:03,Ordithus,Kat
19-12-2020T14:42:09,Ordithus,don't think we've seen gothic Maren
19-12-2020T14:42:10,SpazztasticKiwi,or vampire Kat
19-12-2020T14:42:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll write gothic Maren down then
19-12-2020T14:42:40,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rose: I like this idea
19-12-2020T14:43:00,SpazztasticKiwi,we did have a taste of that though when she was one of the hocus pocus sisters
19-12-2020T14:43:43,SpazztasticKiwi,that might be why I’m mixing up gothic Kat as gothic Maren
19-12-2020T14:44:04,Ordithus,Kat had the hidey hair look :ctwokinds-eyeroll:
19-12-2020T14:44:28,SpazztasticKiwi,all it would be is Kat with bunny ears like “....”
19-12-2020T14:45:11,SpazztasticKiwi,all the universe completely confused like “girl what are you doing”
19-12-2020T14:47:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"goth Maren & Karen: ⛈🌈 “Karen, you’re a goth - goths don’t smile”"

19-12-2020T14:51:51,tehbear,chibbly
19-12-2020T14:53:09,tehbear,"Tom did chibi style characters for some panels of the comic iirc, but not often"
19-12-2020T14:53:39,tehbear,typically when stuff is far in the distance
19-12-2020T14:57:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Karen vs the grinch
19-12-2020T14:57:24,SpazztasticKiwi,what would happen

19-12-2020T15:06:50,CrRAR,"is it the grinch, real grinch, or Clovis grinch?"

19-12-2020T15:07:53,Ordithus,Karen could pull a cindy lou or whatever
19-12-2020T15:08:05,SpazztasticKiwi,but my envisioning was “you have  green hair too?!”
19-12-2020T15:09:13,CrRAR,could evolve into a heartwarming story how having green hair isn't so bad actually.

19-12-2020T15:20:47,Ordithus,you act like we're the weird ones
19-12-2020T15:21:19,tehbear,did we ever have any Half-Life crossover sketches?
19-12-2020T15:21:47,Ordithus,I don't think so. We've had Portal
19-12-2020T15:21:50,Rainelover,"True, mana nukes aren’t exactly a normal conversation topic, but still"
19-12-2020T15:22:06,SpazztasticKiwi,so both cats are in my room

19-12-2020T15:29:29,SpazztasticKiwi,and how to bake the best acorn muffins
19-12-2020T15:29:43,CrRAR,acorns probably more earthy or something
19-12-2020T15:30:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m trying to imagine a squirrel working a coffee bean grinder
19-12-2020T15:30:10,CrRAR,Isn't there like acorn stuffing recipes for thanksgiving?
19-12-2020T15:30:52,Ordithus,maybe? never had acorn anything
19-12-2020T15:31:25,Ordithus,"a friend once made some acorn spirit. I didn't get a chance to try it, but I'm told it wasn't great"
19-12-2020T15:31:27,SpazztasticKiwi,baked stuffed acorns (like stuffed mushrooms)
19-12-2020T15:32:04,SpazztasticKiwi,all Nibblys recipe book is take a recipe and replace one word with “acorn”
19-12-2020T15:32:09,CrRAR,I just read something that says that if they are water-processed they'll end up tasting like potatoes
19-12-2020T15:32:21,CrRAR,before that they're kinda bitter
19-12-2020T15:32:35,CrRAR,Maybe that's what months in the ground helps do
19-12-2020T15:32:48,CrRAR,really balances the flavors

19-12-2020T17:06:32,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,the character looks so much like Laura cause she is one of the devs at CDprojectRed
19-12-2020T17:06:40,Sammit,HI Dragusthor
19-12-2020T17:06:43,ProsePro7,...have we ever seen angry Laura before?
19-12-2020T17:06:56,Roughlandin,When Kat pulled the plug on her
19-12-2020T17:07:11,ProsePro7,Was angry or surprise?
19-12-2020T17:07:11,Dragusthor,:ptv-excited: version of cyberpunk 2077
19-12-2020T17:07:11,Roughlandin,She was more shocked than angry though
19-12-2020T17:07:19,Dragusthor,cool
19-12-2020T17:07:23,ProsePro7,Yeah so this is a first
19-12-2020T17:07:41,BadFoMo,I think that was the prelude to angery Laura.
19-12-2020T17:08:05,NezumiYuki,"Oh yeah Rough, you mean that pic Tom made some streams ago, with Kats tripping over one of Laura's cables, and unplugging her PC, right?  xD  I think I remember that one!"

19-12-2020T17:13:48,Roughlandin,Kat should warn Laura's date for tonight before they go out
19-12-2020T17:13:56,Roughlandin,"Don't dom angry, kids"
19-12-2020T17:14:06,Stormagedon,Very true rough
19-12-2020T17:14:09,tehbear,Maelstrom: the guys without faces? really spooky.
19-12-2020T17:14:10,Hopefighter,"The Original Cyberpunk setting book does have something called Exotics, which are body modifications like animal ears and tails"
19-12-2020T17:14:28,Roughlandin,Tabletop games are way more furry friendly

19-12-2020T17:14:36,ProsePro7,Batman Beyond Splicing
19-12-2020T17:14:39,SpazztasticKiwi,why did that have to be the statement I come back to
19-12-2020T17:14:41,steelabjur,"I could see Clovis as a magical Maelstromer, Animal not so much (Brutus, on the other hand...)"

19-12-2020T17:16:23,Dadrobit,To the level of the Animals? Quite a few I think
19-12-2020T17:16:45,Dragusthor,?
19-12-2020T17:16:50,ShamusTheFox,Could you imagine a society where everyone is roided up to the max 100 percent of the time? No thank you.
19-12-2020T17:17:07,BadFoMo,"I don't know if I would, but if Batman Beyond splicing was a thing IRL who here would do it."

19-12-2020T17:29:53,Twokinds,And stealth is pointless with cybernetics
19-12-2020T17:29:56,Dadrobit,Dying from falling 7 inches probably has the most deaths for me so far.
19-12-2020T17:29:58,steelabjur,I've had some minor bugs too. Some pop in too.
19-12-2020T17:30:09,CrRAR,yeah I feel like clunky mechanics are just an RPG thing
19-12-2020T17:30:09,Twokinds,You can kill a whole building full of people without even being inside if there are any cameras
19-12-2020T17:30:11,NezumiYuki,Yay more MarioKart Double Dash! <3
19-12-2020T17:30:16,ZapiliDver,"Make savegame over 8Mb and it's done, your save is broken."
19-12-2020T17:30:21,Twokinds,"Which is fun, but makes it pointless to try and stealth through it manually."
19-12-2020T17:30:31,ShamusTheFox,Savage
19-12-2020T17:30:33,Dadrobit,Updating my graphics drivers helped a ton of graphical issues.
19-12-2020T17:30:47,Dadrobit,"Yeah, Tom. Ping is OP. I stopped using it."
19-12-2020T17:30:48,steelabjur,I like to stealth around for cameras to hack and to get off Quickhacks. Contagion FTW.
19-12-2020T17:30:50,Roughlandin,"There's also the old Fallout classic of ""Snipe everybody from a mile away and then just waltz to the objective"""
19-12-2020T17:30:56,SpazztasticKiwi,did somebody say “boom”?
19-12-2020T17:30:56,CrRAR,:notes::notes::bird:
19-12-2020T17:30:58,Twokinds,Yeah legendary ping is just broken XD
19-12-2020T17:31:33,Twokinds,But bugs aren't my problem. My problem is that no other quest is like the one demoed at e3.
19-12-2020T17:31:39,NezumiYuki,Give me a ping Vassili... One ping only please?!
19-12-2020T17:31:43,CrRAR,ahhhgh
19-12-2020T17:31:48,Dadrobit,Grinding intelligence just to use cybercychosis is still pretty great though.
19-12-2020T17:31:54,Roughlandin,It is interesting the way they made hacking into basically a magic system
19-12-2020T17:32:21,Folfy,that is true
19-12-2020T17:32:21,microbuss,bugs? *goes Beetle* beep beep :P
19-12-2020T17:32:23,Twokinds,The game doesn't feel like what was advertised.
19-12-2020T17:32:24,Roughlandin,"And like most magic systems, the high level stuff is SUPER op"
19-12-2020T17:32:25,Dadrobit,"Like, how all the quests are pretty much exactly the same?"
19-12-2020T17:32:30,Zakuru,:ptv-excited:
19-12-2020T17:32:35,Zakuru,ok im loving this song
19-12-2020T17:32:37,Ordithus,cyberpunk laura looks awesome :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
19-12-2020T17:32:41,Folfy,indeed
19-12-2020T17:32:43,Roughlandin,She do!
19-12-2020T17:32:46,TeapotOfDoom,zaku's in heaven xD
19-12-2020T17:32:51,CrRAR,:violin::chipmunk:
19-12-2020T17:32:51,Folfy,we need more in Game Laura
19-12-2020T17:32:58,TeapotOfDoom,^^
19-12-2020T17:32:58,Zakuru,Whats this one from?
19-12-2020T17:33:01,Twokinds,"Almost no other but that single one has a branching narrative where you can pick sides or betray sides, make choices. That more than anything makes me feel cheated."
19-12-2020T17:33:01,Dadrobit,"Go to place and either take a thing, hack a thing, shoot a guy, and sometimes don't get caught doing it."
19-12-2020T17:33:09,ShamusTheFox,Is the game still worth the investment though?
19-12-2020T17:33:16,Dimensional,At this time.... not really
19-12-2020T17:33:20,Roughlandin,I like the story
19-12-2020T17:33:22,Dimensional,Especially not if on console
19-12-2020T17:33:23,CrRAR,almost reminds me of something in windwaker... but it's not
19-12-2020T17:33:28,microbuss,fun would be to interupt the current arc in a vehicle hehe
19-12-2020T17:33:37,Zakuru,it reminding me of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles
19-12-2020T17:33:39,Roughlandin,This sounds like Stardew valley
19-12-2020T17:34:03,CrRAR,sounds likely
19-12-2020T17:34:32,Dadrobit,"I've found a few that give options. But it's always the same. ""Don't do the thing you were supposed to do and I'll pay you extra"" at the end of the quest."
19-12-2020T17:34:45,Zakuru,oh well~ was super cute
19-12-2020T17:34:45,CrRAR,huh
19-12-2020T17:34:58,microbuss,well I gotta go get a drink & search thru trash now hehe Also gotta get my old train board down yuck
19-12-2020T17:34:58,CrRAR,illusion of choice~

19-12-2020T17:35:10,microbuss,ill bbl tho
19-12-2020T17:35:15,Roughlandin,Bye Micro
19-12-2020T17:35:15,AspiringNoodle,I saw a video recommendation on youtube
19-12-2020T17:35:19,Sammit,Bye Buss
19-12-2020T17:35:22,ZapiliDver,bb micro
19-12-2020T17:35:32,AspiringNoodle,It claims that cyberpunk shows how the AAA industry is fundamentally broken
19-12-2020T17:35:43,steelabjur,"One funny bug I had was I broke this ex-cop out of a madhouse and hop into the car I had parked outside, drove her across the parkinglot and street to the waiting Fixer car. My car froze in place and the woman STOOD UP on the car seat."
19-12-2020T17:35:51,Dadrobit,"literally CrRAR. Just did one before the stream. ""Don't kill me and I'll give you everything in the safe."" Killed her and she dropped her safe passkey, so I got it anyways."
19-12-2020T17:36:04,Ordithus,how rude
19-12-2020T17:36:14,CrRAR,wow
19-12-2020T17:36:32,falangie123,why did the studio crunch so hard to deliver such a buggy result??
19-12-2020T17:36:40,Dadrobit,"Also, she totally killed a kid in a hit and run and ""Got away with it"" so I had to do it."
19-12-2020T17:36:45,FloofyCat,Because Cyberpunk has to be released this year
19-12-2020T17:36:50,falangie123,must be so frustrating for the staff who put in all that overtime
19-12-2020T17:36:57,CrRAR,probably crunched to make it shippable for pre-holidays
19-12-2020T17:37:03,FloofyCat,"Because Cyberpunk was originally Cyberpunk 2020, so they wanted to release the game in 2020."
19-12-2020T17:37:07,AspiringNoodle,At least they got paid for the overtime
19-12-2020T17:37:14,falangie123,is it really 'shippable' though
19-12-2020T17:37:17,steelabjur,It needed more testing and bug hunting. Getting death threats probably didn't help either...
19-12-2020T17:37:17,CrRAR,wouldn't be surprised if all the messy stuff is sorted out by spingtime maybe
19-12-2020T17:37:19,AspiringNoodle,And it wasn't near American crunch from what I saw
19-12-2020T17:37:20,Roughlandin,It needed like another year of development but the corporate side wanted it out by the fiscal year
19-12-2020T17:37:26,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,:ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:*[Ohh Trace!! I got a present for you!!!]
19-12-2020T17:37:32,Roughlandin,And they didn't want to miss the holiday sales rush
19-12-2020T17:37:45,CrRAR,that was probably their original ship date internally or something
19-12-2020T17:37:49,eric190,my net's being flaky today. constant buffering on all streams.
19-12-2020T17:37:50,falangie123,yeh makes sense the corpos would push them
19-12-2020T17:38:07,Roughlandin,The original date was back in like april wasn't it?
19-12-2020T17:38:13,FloofyCat,"It doesn't matter that much tbh, the game would always be infamous in some regard."
19-12-2020T17:38:20,falangie123,i just wonder if this botched launch was worth the reputational damage
19-12-2020T17:38:26,FloofyCat,It was hyped so much that no matter what it'd never live up to the expectations.
19-12-2020T17:38:27,CrRAR,yeah but clearly they needed another year
19-12-2020T17:38:29,CrRAR,lol
19-12-2020T17:38:36,steelabjur,"@FloofyCat Cyberpunk 2020 was the first edition of the tabletop RPG, it was released in 1990."
19-12-2020T17:38:44,FloofyCat,^ that
19-12-2020T17:38:45,Xexanoth,The funny thing about CP2077 is that people seem to forget that Witcher 3 was also pretty buggy when it released
19-12-2020T17:38:48,CrRAR,"""Nah Christmas BLOCKBUSTER!"""
19-12-2020T17:38:53,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-clovischuckle:

19-12-2020T17:39:01,Xexanoth,so i'm not sure why everyone expected different
19-12-2020T17:39:03,MviluUatusun,Good Sunday everybody.  How your day going?
19-12-2020T17:39:06,Ordithus,aren't like all AAA games buggy on release now?

19-12-2020T17:39:08,Dadrobit,"Truth be told, only one side-quest so far has felt like someone really took the time to write a real story like Witcher's now that I think about it. Feels kinda sad."

19-12-2020T17:41:21,AspiringNoodle,Sometimes the good thing about a huge backlog of media to consume...
19-12-2020T17:41:27,Roughlandin,They should have just dropped last gen console support
19-12-2020T17:41:29,NezumiYuki,WAIIIIIIIT.... Nora not lewd?  how even?
19-12-2020T17:41:30,MviluUatusun,Howdy Sammit.
19-12-2020T17:41:34,AspiringNoodle,"By the time you get around to something, you know if it was actually good or not"
19-12-2020T17:41:52,CrRAR,"honestly, dev probably started on last gen consoles"
19-12-2020T17:41:56,Roughlandin,It was insane to ask them to basically make 5 different versions of the game
19-12-2020T17:41:56,AspiringNoodle,^
19-12-2020T17:42:03,tehbear,but then you cant join the discussion and hang out with the cool kids Noodle!?
19-12-2020T17:42:04,CrRAR,wasn't it in development forever?
19-12-2020T17:42:05,ZapiliDver,Just wait for some more patches. BTW it's more good than bad

19-12-2020T17:42:32,ZapiliDver,And don't buy it for PS4 =)
19-12-2020T17:42:34,CrRAR,That' probably explains a lot of it's issues probably ported on the fly to newer gens
19-12-2020T17:42:35,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it was in development when the PS4 launched."
19-12-2020T17:42:35,AspiringNoodle,I think the biggest issue is that they want Cyberpunk to work on too huge a disparity of hardware
19-12-2020T17:42:36,Roughlandin,Running 1080p medium
19-12-2020T17:42:37,Twokinds,I feel like AAA gaming is just constantly disappointing me lately.

19-12-2020T17:44:38,Dadrobit,I cannot even begin to imagine the develpment hell CP2077 went through that they were planning for a console generation and completely managed to fuck up that specific generation.
19-12-2020T17:44:39,Roughlandin,AAA is a victim to investor expectations
19-12-2020T17:44:41,ProsePro7,I just played Hallow Knight and it was better than most recent games Ive played
19-12-2020T17:45:03,tehbear,Shovel Knight is also a good indie platformer
19-12-2020T17:45:03,w0lfmare,AAA games will come around eventually

19-12-2020T17:45:23,CrRAR,smaller projects have stronger vision and usually more finite thing to achieve
19-12-2020T17:45:26,AspiringNoodle,The indie scene is thriving and releasing tons of smash hits.  AAA is just failure after expensive failure.
19-12-2020T17:45:30,Roughlandin,I'm just happy it isn't beating you over the head with microtransactions
19-12-2020T17:45:33,ProsePro7,Out of the fire the pheonix becomes stronger
19-12-2020T17:45:52,Twokinds,"completely bloated, AAA gaming has become."
19-12-2020T17:45:54,AspiringNoodle,We might finally reaching a point where AAA games need to start scaling DOWN instead of UP

19-12-2020T17:48:30,AspiringNoodle,"w0lf, I feel that way about WoW :/"
19-12-2020T17:48:30,tehbear,the resident evil remakes are pretty good... but dunno if they qualify as AAA as they are remakes...

19-12-2020T17:49:34,tehbear,more devs should follow the ID software philosophy: release when its done

19-12-2020T17:50:42,Roughlandin,"Again, investor expectations are making games come out before they're ready for release. They just want a payday. They don't care about the actual quality of the product"
19-12-2020T17:50:46,w0lfmare,Early access is really smart for games unfortunately
19-12-2020T17:50:49,Ordithus,kid me should never have been exposed to duke nukem 3d :ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
19-12-2020T17:51:02,ZapiliDver,Early access is that: you pay to be a beta tester
19-12-2020T17:51:16,ZapiliDver,Or even an alpha tester
19-12-2020T17:51:18,CrRAR,so diabolical
19-12-2020T17:51:28,AspiringNoodle,Or you could be playing WoW in current year

19-12-2020T17:54:54,SpazztasticKiwi,it was 3/4
19-12-2020T17:55:03,Dadrobit,But you had another Coke after that no?

19-12-2020T17:55:30,SpazztasticKiwi,which I can’t stand but I didn’t want to add to the sugar I’d had
19-12-2020T17:55:44,Roughlandin,Aspertame can cause headaches

19-12-2020T17:56:57,Ordithus,so today you are alive
19-12-2020T17:57:00,Ordithus,\o/
19-12-2020T17:57:00,AspiringNoodle,Artificial sweeteners basically have all the same downsides as regular sugar
19-12-2020T17:57:01,CrRAR,\o/
19-12-2020T17:57:20,Ordithus,got an oral thermometer instead of one of those no contact ones?
19-12-2020T17:57:21,AspiringNoodle,But some extra downsides on top of that.
19-12-2020T17:57:25,TheSexyBeast,Noodle speaks truth!
19-12-2020T17:57:30,SpazztasticKiwi,not on me now

19-12-2020T17:58:29,SpazztasticKiwi,they would’ve chased me out the door if it was deemed any concerning number

19-12-2020T18:07:14,Roughlandin,...That sounds expensive
19-12-2020T18:07:25,steelabjur,@TheSexyBeast that would take a powerful entity to do that. Or Trace playing along until she's all tied up.
19-12-2020T18:08:09,ZapiliDver,Sending a live cat over a post is not a good idea...
19-12-2020T18:08:12,ShamusTheFox,@steelabjur Or an incident like the Basitin Isles where she is robbed of her power for a time.

19-12-2020T19:01:43,RedEyesWheeler,I like Laura and all. (More than Flora actually) but I still have to give it to Reni though
19-12-2020T19:01:50,Ordithus,"she may have been strong enough to actually wield it and not give in to Sauron, but that is a big if"
19-12-2020T19:01:56,Ordithus,Can't imagine it would have gone well
19-12-2020T19:01:59,falangie123,yeah
19-12-2020T19:02:26,MuonNeutrino,the ring was always too strong for anyone with Power to wield safely

19-12-2020T19:03:25,Katfeathers,At the last moment it even corrupted Frodo
19-12-2020T19:03:37,falangie123,melkor wasnt a baddie but he was prideful and jealous from the start
19-12-2020T19:03:46,RedEyesWheeler,hmmmm what track is this?
19-12-2020T19:03:53,RedEyesWheeler,Isn't this from Mario?

19-12-2020T22:48:45,CrRAR,"cold weather that's been happening, temp changes, best way to catch any number of things"
19-12-2020T22:57:30,Ordithus,I have a hunch on what was being drawn before tk high 3
19-12-2020T22:58:01,Ordithus,le smoochie
19-12-2020T22:58:59,KeefMcDerpface,?
19-12-2020T22:59:18,Roughlandin,Nibbly steals the mistletoe from Sythe and Maren?
19-12-2020T23:00:00,Ordithus,well there were quite a few mistletoe and kissy suggestions
19-12-2020T23:00:13,Ordithus,so we will see
19-12-2020T23:00:22,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rose:
19-12-2020T23:00:40,Roughlandin,Moar kissy is always good
19-12-2020T23:01:51,CrRAR,ah yeah there was a brief kissy looking doodle
19-12-2020T23:02:48,KeefMcDerpface,Oh that?
19-12-2020T23:03:02,Roughlandin,Faces were colliding
19-12-2020T23:05:00,Ordithus,there were only 6 kiss/mistletoe suggestions in round 4
19-12-2020T23:05:01,Ordithus,wow
19-12-2020T23:05:09,Ordithus,the fans demand smooch
19-12-2020T23:05:14,KeefMcDerpface,Only 6...
19-12-2020T23:05:24,Roughlandin,Only 6! Those are rookie numbers! We gotta pump those numbers up!
19-12-2020T23:11:07,CrRAR,for how brief it was the head angles looked on point
19-12-2020T23:11:42,Roughlandin,They fit like puzzle pieces
19-12-2020T23:11:48,CrRAR,Couple of professional smoochies possibly
19-12-2020T23:12:50,Roughlandin,"If professional smoochie was a job, I'd sign up in a second"
19-12-2020T23:14:43,CrRAR,haha
19-12-2020T23:26:35,SpazztasticKiwi,work again in 12 hours
19-12-2020T23:27:22,Ordithus,aren't you going to need to get tested first? cough is a symptom.
19-12-2020T23:27:24,Roughlandin,"Oof. Take care of yourself, Kiwi"
19-12-2020T23:28:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t have any of the others though
19-12-2020T23:28:25,CrRAR,oh good
19-12-2020T23:28:38,Ordithus,well walmart ought to have guidance for you
19-12-2020T23:28:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I could but that would mean filing a time off request
19-12-2020T23:28:40,CrRAR,Yeah try to survive it and get some rest!
19-12-2020T23:29:25,Ordithus,I know my employer would kick me right out at least until a negative test
19-12-2020T23:29:48,CrRAR,Yeah if you tick enough of the symptom boxes
19-12-2020T23:29:57,Roughlandin,"Take care of yourself first, Kiwi. Work won't."
19-12-2020T23:30:06,CrRAR,"Test early, test often"
19-12-2020T23:30:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"if I get tested, I miss work tomorrow"
19-12-2020T23:30:38,SpazztasticKiwi,which will count against me double the points since it’s the holiday season
19-12-2020T23:30:44,Ordithus,damn
19-12-2020T23:30:53,Roughlandin,Oof
19-12-2020T23:30:57,SpazztasticKiwi,but if I get the leave approved to get tested it won’t
19-12-2020T23:31:02,CrRAR,Yeah it takes consderable time to arrage to get one
19-12-2020T23:31:14,CrRAR,Ah
19-12-2020T23:31:16,CrRAR,Wow
19-12-2020T23:31:25,CrRAR,That’s like counterintuitive
19-12-2020T23:31:36,SpazztasticKiwi,but this means filling out a drawn out application of sorts through some higher ups to put it “on record”
19-12-2020T23:31:42,Roughlandin,Sorry Kiwi. Not trying to tell you how to live your life. Just try to stay safe and healthy
19-12-2020T23:31:53,SpazztasticKiwi,then they gotta process it
19-12-2020T23:32:03,SpazztasticKiwi,then you learn if they approve it or bot
19-12-2020T23:32:16,Ordithus,so complex
19-12-2020T23:32:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"if approved, the absence won’t go against you whether you test positive or negative"
19-12-2020T23:32:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"if not, you get points against attendance"
19-12-2020T23:33:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"as far as I know though, they’re okaying absences taken to be tested"
19-12-2020T23:33:35,Ordithus,"with a cough and being customer facing, I'd hope you would be approved at least for that, if you do that"
19-12-2020T23:33:40,CrRAR,"Argh, Sadly by that logic they’re like they expect getting test to be something you can predict and plan for."
19-12-2020T23:33:47,CrRAR,yeah
19-12-2020T23:34:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"one because they’re not playing games and two because if they counted a test day against an employee, they’d be in hot water"
19-12-2020T23:35:30,Roughlandin,"Good luck, Kiwi. Take care of yourself first!"
19-12-2020T23:35:35,Roughlandin,:two_hearts::two_hearts:
19-12-2020T23:35:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d have gotten myself tested several times over by now if it wasn’t done the way it is
19-12-2020T23:36:04,Roughlandin,:(
19-12-2020T23:37:05,CrRAR,it blew my mind that schools didn’t have testing capabilities for when assessing the sickly kids
19-12-2020T23:37:33,Roughlandin,Oh my mom is a first grade teacher and this whole semester has pissed me off to no end
19-12-2020T23:37:54,CrRAR,"Like suspected kids have to go with parents to a place, 3rd party then have to inform the school"
19-12-2020T23:38:21,CrRAR,Just have test people or whatever AT the schools if you’re trying to keep them open
19-12-2020T23:38:27,CrRAR,so silly
19-12-2020T23:38:35,Roughlandin,Kids and health information is a nightmare already
19-12-2020T23:38:47,CrRAR,yeahhh
19-12-2020T23:39:50,Roughlandin,I'm still mad that they make my mom go INTO the school building when she's teaching 100% remote kids
19-12-2020T23:39:52,KeefMcDerpface,"I'm glad I graduated last year, but I feel sorry for my former teachers and those in the lower grades."
19-12-2020T23:40:07,CrRAR,Arg yeah
19-12-2020T23:40:33,CrRAR,They pretended like schools are suddenly covid-free zones xD
19-12-2020T23:40:48,Roughlandin,"Like, the whole reason she volunteered to teach remote is because my dad is immunocompromised and she didn't want to have to be exposed at school"
19-12-2020T23:41:02,CrRAR,Like how being in a restaurant somehow suddenly no masks are okay
19-12-2020T23:41:14,Roughlandin,Grrrr. People
19-12-2020T23:41:24,CrRAR,"Course ya gotta eat but, it’s like it makes no sense"
19-12-2020T23:41:41,Roughlandin,Just get take out!
19-12-2020T23:41:42,KeefMcDerpface,indeed
19-12-2020T23:41:48,CrRAR,yup
19-12-2020T23:41:57,Roughlandin,I haven't eaten in a restaurant in nearly a year now!
19-12-2020T23:42:01,Ordithus,same
19-12-2020T23:42:03,Roughlandin,It's not that hard
19-12-2020T23:42:23,Ordithus,I've actually been getting more takeout since in-person dining was shut down again
19-12-2020T23:42:28,CrRAR,^ same
19-12-2020T23:42:29,Ordithus,feel safer
19-12-2020T23:42:59,CrRAR,Gotta support the foodies too!
19-12-2020T23:43:03,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-adiracoin:
19-12-2020T23:43:06,Roughlandin,I've been trying to support local restaurants
19-12-2020T23:43:17,Ordithus,takeout booze is funny
19-12-2020T23:43:18,Roughlandin,But you can do that without dining in
19-12-2020T23:43:35,CrRAR,“Here’s your food”
19-12-2020T23:43:42,Roughlandin,This year has turned me on to growlers in a big way
19-12-2020T23:43:47,CrRAR,“...and here’s your adult sippy cup”
19-12-2020T23:43:51,Roughlandin,Great local beer to go!
19-12-2020T23:43:52,CrRAR,xD
19-12-2020T23:43:52,Ordithus,lol
19-12-2020T23:43:52,KeefMcDerpface,lol
19-12-2020T23:43:56,Roughlandin,haha
19-12-2020T23:44:35,Ordithus,it's not new but the other month I got a growler of local root beer
19-12-2020T23:44:43,Roughlandin,Oooh
19-12-2020T23:46:39,SpazztasticKiwi,they brought back wine windows from the plague  days
19-12-2020T23:47:42,Roughlandin,"If there is a window with wine in it, I'm down"
19-12-2020T23:48:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean
19-12-2020T23:48:29,SpazztasticKiwi,during the plague people would have their wine delivered through small windows in shops
19-12-2020T23:48:35,CrRAR,Ppl show up at it like
19-12-2020T23:48:38,CrRAR,:cw0lfmare-EmberO:*[wine?]
19-12-2020T23:48:41,SpazztasticKiwi,like a tiny drive thu

19-12-2020T23:49:24,Roughlandin,*Whine
19-12-2020T23:49:28,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rose::wine_glass:
19-12-2020T23:49:53,SpazztasticKiwi,is sneezing a symptom
19-12-2020T23:49:58,Roughlandin,:cheese: with your :wine_glass:?
19-12-2020T23:50:02,SpazztasticKiwi,cause I’ve been doing that for the week
19-12-2020T23:50:05,CrRAR,I think sneezing is not
19-12-2020T23:50:20,Ordithus,don't think so but dunno
19-12-2020T23:50:27,CrRAR,Sneezing sniffles are safe
19-12-2020T23:50:28,SpazztasticKiwi,& it’s not quiet calm sneezing either
19-12-2020T23:50:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m a whole dad sneeze
19-12-2020T23:50:43,CrRAR,Oh no you got the croup
19-12-2020T23:50:45,Roughlandin,Hmm
19-12-2020T23:52:22,SpazztasticKiwi,ever since it got cold
19-12-2020T23:52:46,Roughlandin,Dust allergies? Running the heater means more dust
19-12-2020T23:52:57,Ordithus,dry air is a big part
19-12-2020T23:53:02,Roughlandin,That too
19-12-2020T23:53:08,SpazztasticKiwi,dry air
19-12-2020T23:53:21,Roughlandin,I need to get a humidifier for my room
19-12-2020T23:53:22,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s rained every other day for the later half of this month
19-12-2020T23:53:29,Ordithus,"but it's cold, yeah?"
19-12-2020T23:53:35,Roughlandin,All winter long I wake up with dry mouth
19-12-2020T23:53:38,SpazztasticKiwi,this is the wettest dry air I’ve ever seen
19-12-2020T23:53:42,Ordithus,lol
19-12-2020T23:53:50,SpazztasticKiwi,47
19-12-2020T23:54:15,Ordithus,"there's a lot less moisture in cold air, even if it is humid"
19-12-2020T23:55:00,SpazztasticKiwi,oh & that story the other day
19-12-2020T23:55:12,SpazztasticKiwi,somebody left $100 at the self checkout
19-12-2020T23:55:27,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-adiracoin:
19-12-2020T23:55:34,Roughlandin,Merry Christmas!
19-12-2020T23:55:48,Ordithus,she doesn't get to keep that ya dumb
19-12-2020T23:55:50,SpazztasticKiwi,register was “processing” when I got to it & then tells me to take my change when I hadn’t even scanned anything yet
19-12-2020T23:56:20,CrRAR,:robot::dollar:
19-12-2020T23:56:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I ran down a guy I’d seen walking by with a bag but he’d come from the service desk & said it wasn’t his
19-12-2020T23:57:00,Ordithus,strange to just walk away and leave it
19-12-2020T23:57:02,SpazztasticKiwi,so the register monitor reprinted the receipt & took the money
19-12-2020T23:57:23,SpazztasticKiwi,no word if they came back for the change
19-12-2020T23:57:59,Roughlandin,Here's hoping
19-12-2020T23:58:05,Roughlandin,That's a lot to lose around the holidays
19-12-2020T23:58:16,SpazztasticKiwi,what I want to know is how you buy a pinwheel & pay so much that you get $100 in change
19-12-2020T23:58:27,SpazztasticKiwi,they’re $2.98
19-12-2020T23:58:28,Roughlandin,lol
19-12-2020T23:58:34,Ordithus,pay with a $500?
19-12-2020T23:58:35,Roughlandin,That's an expensive sweet
19-12-2020T23:58:55,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s not a desert
19-12-2020T23:59:08,KeefMcDerpface,holy hell
19-12-2020T23:59:20,CrRAR,Wait does the self checkouts do cashback on debit?
19-12-2020T23:59:30,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s my theory
19-12-2020T23:59:38,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s got to be cash back
19-12-2020T23:59:48,CrRAR,yyeahh
19-12-2020T23:59:54,SpazztasticKiwi,in which case they probably could track the person down
