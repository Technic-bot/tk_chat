05-01-2020T07:41:27,AspiringNoodle,I had a fun monologue with myself in the shower xD
05-01-2020T09:47:35,HoverdudeXL,Helo
05-01-2020T12:36:40,HoverdudeXL,Yay no hospital
05-01-2020T12:53:39,CrRAR,Huzzah!
05-01-2020T13:26:15,CrimsonQuill,Hi
05-01-2020T13:29:51,CrimsonQuill,The die is cast
05-01-2020T13:29:55,CrimsonQuill,I have taken my exam
05-01-2020T13:30:09,CrimsonQuill,And now I have to wait a month before I know whether I passed or not
05-01-2020T14:15:38,TeapotOfDoom,a freakin month?
05-01-2020T14:16:08,CrimsonQuill,Yep
05-01-2020T14:16:19,CrimsonQuill,My exam was right at the start
05-01-2020T14:16:19,TeapotOfDoom,well sounds like a fun wait
05-01-2020T14:16:22,CrimsonQuill,Also Hiya
05-01-2020T14:16:28,TeapotOfDoom,hiho
05-01-2020T14:16:36,CrimsonQuill,"But yeah, the exams go for two weeks"
05-01-2020T14:16:43,CrimsonQuill,Then there's a week of exam boards
05-01-2020T14:16:47,CrimsonQuill,And some more time
05-01-2020T14:16:58,CrimsonQuill,Then I know whether I actually passed or not.
05-01-2020T14:17:17,TeapotOfDoom,damn i just opened a bottle of gin i received for my bday a few months ago and had a glass. it's freakin delicious
05-01-2020T14:17:33,CrimsonQuill,I haven't tried gin.
05-01-2020T14:17:46,CrimsonQuill,I like a shot of whiskey every once in a while however
05-01-2020T14:18:01,TeapotOfDoom,really depends on the gin. most of them are quite bitter
05-01-2020T14:18:32,TeapotOfDoom,but this one is freakin good. japanese gin
05-01-2020T14:19:02,CrimsonQuill,Neat
05-01-2020T14:19:04,TeapotOfDoom,also expensive :ptv-uneasy:
05-01-2020T14:19:09,CrimsonQuill,Not so neat
05-01-2020T14:19:14,CrimsonQuill,How was the stream?
05-01-2020T14:19:20,TeapotOfDoom,yesterday?
05-01-2020T14:19:31,TeapotOfDoom,tom was tired. cut short after number 4
05-01-2020T14:19:40,CrimsonQuill,Ok
05-01-2020T14:19:49,CrimsonQuill,I only popped in to say goodnight see
05-01-2020T14:19:51,TeapotOfDoom,maybe a follow up today we'll see
05-01-2020T14:20:00,CrimsonQuill,I saw a tiny child Raine about to boop a toy
05-01-2020T14:20:04,CrimsonQuill,It was sweet
05-01-2020T14:20:12,TeapotOfDoom,it is
05-01-2020T14:20:20,CrimsonQuill,And tomorrow...
05-01-2020T14:20:24,CrimsonQuill,I'm going to chillax.
05-01-2020T14:20:29,CrimsonQuill,Go for a run in the morning...
05-01-2020T14:20:33,CrimsonQuill,Clean the bathroom...
05-01-2020T14:20:37,CrimsonQuill,Draw some Halo stuff...
05-01-2020T14:20:45,CrimsonQuill,Write out that SCP article...
05-01-2020T14:20:50,TeapotOfDoom,we also got some more of the adventurers and more nib nab
05-01-2020T14:21:02,CrimsonQuill,Oh neat
05-01-2020T14:21:04,TeapotOfDoom,sounds like a nice day
05-01-2020T14:21:18,CrimsonQuill,I'd like to think that I'll do all of those things
05-01-2020T14:21:26,CrimsonQuill,And not sit in front of my computer all day
05-01-2020T14:21:35,TeapotOfDoom,haha....ha....
05-01-2020T14:22:03,TeapotOfDoom,ah yes and a romantic dinner (maren and sythe) had to zap through the recording real fast
05-01-2020T14:22:29,CrimsonQuill,Oh ok
05-01-2020T14:22:38,CrimsonQuill,I'm going to visit some nostalgia.
05-01-2020T14:23:08,CrimsonQuill,"After I've read tonight's chapter, I want to go to the stream channel and watch the video recording of when Halo Raine was sketched."
05-01-2020T14:23:38,TeapotOfDoom,that was before i even joyned the stream chat i think
05-01-2020T14:23:45,TeapotOfDoom,wow it's been a year already
05-01-2020T14:23:57,CrimsonQuill,I joined last June
05-01-2020T14:24:33,TeapotOfDoom,you joined before me
05-01-2020T14:25:05,TeapotOfDoom,i know because i binged stream recordings before actually creating a picarto account and i recognised your username
05-01-2020T14:25:47,TeapotOfDoom,man I'm still working on the regulator (is it? i dunno the right translaton...)for this system
05-01-2020T14:26:49,CrimsonQuill,Regulator?
05-01-2020T14:27:48,TeapotOfDoom,well
05-01-2020T14:27:58,TeapotOfDoom,i asked google and leo
05-01-2020T14:28:10,TeapotOfDoom,none of them has been very helpful
05-01-2020T14:28:47,TeapotOfDoom,"if you have a system like a pendulum, what do you call a device that is able to stabilize it in the upright position?"
05-01-2020T14:29:09,TeapotOfDoom,like a pendulum on a sled
05-01-2020T14:29:21,TeapotOfDoom,controller?
05-01-2020T14:29:51,CrimsonQuill,The fulcrum?>
05-01-2020T14:29:57,CrimsonQuill,No...that's the point of turning
05-01-2020T14:29:59,CrimsonQuill,Damn
05-01-2020T14:30:14,TeapotOfDoom,but you get what i mean?
05-01-2020T14:38:19,CrimsonQuill,Not really
05-01-2020T14:38:21,CrimsonQuill,Sorry
05-01-2020T14:43:21,TeapotOfDoom,no problem
05-01-2020T14:43:37,TeapotOfDoom,would be interesting what the proper english word was tho
05-01-2020T14:44:01,TeapotOfDoom,ima ask one of my profs sometime
05-01-2020T14:44:10,CrimsonQuill,Good idea
05-01-2020T14:44:32,TeapotOfDoom,our script is in german so no help there
05-01-2020T14:44:58,TeapotOfDoom,how's your halo thing doing anyway?
05-01-2020T14:45:16,CrimsonQuill,Well I can finally get back to it tomorrow
05-01-2020T14:45:20,CrimsonQuill,Since no exams
05-01-2020T14:45:30,CrimsonQuill,But I am now terrified of that Raine Ref redraw
05-01-2020T14:45:40,CrimsonQuill,Because of how I might get the eyes wrong
05-01-2020T14:46:20,CrimsonQuill,"If I get the head wrong in the body view, it throws everything else off."
05-01-2020T14:56:03,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-nibrun::ctwokinds-nibrun::ctwokinds-nibrun:
05-01-2020T14:56:23,CrimsonQuill,DOOT
05-01-2020T14:56:24,TeapotOfDoom,ya know what
05-01-2020T14:56:29,TeapotOfDoom,:ctwokinds-nibrun::ctwokinds-nibrun::ctwokinds-nibrun:
05-01-2020T14:57:23,TeapotOfDoom,how about you just try to redraw her in the style that you see and like her in
05-01-2020T14:57:42,CrimsonQuill,The problem is...
05-01-2020T14:57:54,CrimsonQuill,That style is almost completely Tom's style.#
05-01-2020T14:58:02,TeapotOfDoom,then go for that
05-01-2020T14:58:06,CrimsonQuill,"I can throw in some little touches, yes,"
05-01-2020T14:58:29,CrimsonQuill,But I definitely don't want to go for hyperrealism with her.
05-01-2020T14:58:33,CrimsonQuill,She looks fine as is
05-01-2020T14:58:54,CrimsonQuill,"That being said...in my sketches for my OCs, they've steadily become more lifelike in expression."
05-01-2020T14:59:09,TeapotOfDoom,then i would fit her into that
05-01-2020T14:59:20,TeapotOfDoom,she's more then a copy
05-01-2020T14:59:34,CrimsonQuill,True that
05-01-2020T14:59:39,TeapotOfDoom,see
05-01-2020T14:59:40,CrimsonQuill,"Also, is that an RvB Reference?"
05-01-2020T14:59:45,CrimsonQuill,Because it sounds familiar...
05-01-2020T15:00:12,CrimsonQuill,"""You were my greatest creation."""
05-01-2020T15:00:17,TeapotOfDoom,nope still haven't seen that yeet
05-01-2020T15:00:20,TeapotOfDoom,*yet
05-01-2020T15:00:42,CrimsonQuill,"""I don't know what I am. But I do know this. I'm more than just a copy of you...I'm better than you."""
05-01-2020T15:00:57,CrimsonQuill,You'll understand the line when you see it
05-01-2020T15:00:58,TeapotOfDoom,i made a remake of kda pop stars (don't ask why that song. i don't know). i decided not to go for a 1:1 copy but to aim for something that would sound good. still proud of the mixdown
05-01-2020T15:01:08,CrimsonQuill,Neat
05-01-2020T15:01:27,CrimsonQuill,I want to make sure that she looks right for her character and that she melds in with the others
05-01-2020T15:01:28,TeapotOfDoom,meaning i would not go for a 1:1 tom raine
05-01-2020T15:01:39,CrimsonQuill,"Well, it's not likely to be 1:1"
05-01-2020T15:01:50,CrimsonQuill,I'm not that good yet
05-01-2020T15:01:56,CrimsonQuill,But...I have cool ideas
05-01-2020T15:02:03,CrimsonQuill,How the characters'll meet
05-01-2020T15:02:05,CrimsonQuill,Relate
05-01-2020T15:02:07,CrimsonQuill,Become a Team
05-01-2020T15:02:18,CrimsonQuill,"Luke Adams for example, is a bit...Flamboyant."
05-01-2020T15:02:20,TeapotOfDoom,reminds me
05-01-2020T15:02:32,CrimsonQuill,As in...uses a banshee bomb as a catapult flamboyant.
05-01-2020T15:02:33,TeapotOfDoom,how's your dnd campaign doing
05-01-2020T15:02:40,CrimsonQuill,Black Crusade?
05-01-2020T15:02:53,CrimsonQuill,Oh wait!
05-01-2020T15:03:03,CrimsonQuill,Was that the one I said my sister was doing?
05-01-2020T15:03:03,TeapotOfDoom,you haven't told me the name yet so ima go with yes
05-01-2020T15:03:19,CrimsonQuill,Because we couldn't do that because none of us knew the rules.
05-01-2020T15:03:20,TeapotOfDoom,nope you said you were working on one as far as i remember
05-01-2020T15:03:33,CrimsonQuill,But I'm now with a Black Crusade group
05-01-2020T15:03:38,CrimsonQuill,We haven't met up in a bit
05-01-2020T15:03:41,CrimsonQuill,Busy for everyonw
05-01-2020T15:03:46,CrimsonQuill,But next Friday we have a game
05-01-2020T15:03:49,CrimsonQuill,It'll be nice
05-01-2020T15:06:16,TeapotOfDoom,sweet
05-01-2020T15:06:41,CrimsonQuill,I have decided though
05-01-2020T15:06:48,TeapotOfDoom,on what?
05-01-2020T15:06:57,CrimsonQuill,"That tomorrow, I want to take a picture of some of the sketches I've done opver the past few months"
05-01-2020T15:07:05,CrimsonQuill,Just to show that it's not just a load of hot air
05-01-2020T15:07:15,CrimsonQuill,And maybe draw a new one
05-01-2020T15:07:16,TeapotOfDoom,pls do
05-01-2020T15:07:21,CrimsonQuill,I know who's going to be who as well
05-01-2020T15:07:27,TeapotOfDoom,(wanna see)
05-01-2020T15:07:31,CrimsonQuill,"Thomas'll be the Heavy, Leader and Engineer."
05-01-2020T15:07:47,CrimsonQuill,"Luke'll be the Jack-of-all-stats, Linguist and Technician"
05-01-2020T15:08:05,CrimsonQuill,"Raine'll be the sniper, CQC expert (Knife to meet ya) and AI host"
05-01-2020T15:08:25,CrimsonQuill,(Which is where AI Red'll come in. I'll give them a coat so they're not too much like Cortana)
05-01-2020T15:08:39,CrimsonQuill,"In fact, maybe I should do a sketch of the whole gang tomorrow..."
05-01-2020T15:08:49,CrimsonQuill,I mean the ref sheets aren't all ready but to heck with it
05-01-2020T15:08:51,CrimsonQuill,Why not?
05-01-2020T15:09:47,TeapotOfDoom,do it
05-01-2020T15:09:56,TeapotOfDoom,curious now
05-01-2020T15:10:11,TeapotOfDoom,did some sketches as well in the last few months
05-01-2020T15:10:17,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, just a few"
05-01-2020T15:11:05,CrimsonQuill,"Actually, yeah"
05-01-2020T15:11:15,TeapotOfDoom,me as well i meant xD
05-01-2020T15:11:16,TeapotOfDoom,i should really stop to abrieviate my sentences to death
05-01-2020T15:11:16,CrimsonQuill,Imma gonna draw it and upload it by tomorrow evening
05-01-2020T15:11:25,TeapotOfDoom,noice
05-01-2020T15:11:35,TeapotOfDoom,you said you changed your da?
05-01-2020T15:11:39,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, yeah"
05-01-2020T15:11:47,CrimsonQuill,Now it's Crimson-Quill-086
05-01-2020T15:11:57,CrimsonQuill,I had to pay for core membership to change the name
05-01-2020T15:12:10,CrimsonQuill,I just wanted it to match my username everywhere else.
05-01-2020T15:12:32,CrimsonQuill,"And ""Incoming-101""...I came up with that when I was 14. I'm embarrased by it now."
05-01-2020T15:13:19,TeapotOfDoom,you don't wanna know the name i came up with when i created my first youtube profile
05-01-2020T15:13:32,CrimsonQuill,No...I don't
05-01-2020T15:13:36,CrimsonQuill,So..
05-01-2020T15:13:38,CrimsonQuill,Kittens
05-01-2020T15:13:42,TeapotOfDoom,cute
05-01-2020T15:13:42,CrimsonQuill,Kittens and Cats
05-01-2020T15:13:46,TeapotOfDoom,really cute
05-01-2020T15:13:56,CrimsonQuill,Our three cats at my aunt's are growing nicely
05-01-2020T15:14:02,CrimsonQuill,They were neutered recently
05-01-2020T15:14:08,TeapotOfDoom,young ones i guess?
05-01-2020T15:14:10,CrimsonQuill,Pangur Bán is SO FLOOFY
05-01-2020T15:14:26,CrimsonQuill,And Cinder and Cloud are accustoming themselves to people.
05-01-2020T15:14:32,CrimsonQuill,They are so damn cute...
05-01-2020T15:14:42,CrimsonQuill,But I haven't seen them in a bit
05-01-2020T15:14:53,TeapotOfDoom,awww
05-01-2020T15:15:02,TeapotOfDoom,i would love to have a cat as well
05-01-2020T15:15:02,CrimsonQuill,It's ok though
05-01-2020T15:15:13,CrimsonQuill,They're hard at work on the farm
05-01-2020T15:15:14,TeapotOfDoom,i'd call it Pixel
05-01-2020T15:15:25,CrimsonQuill,Pixel? Neat name?
05-01-2020T15:15:29,CrimsonQuill,Interesting
05-01-2020T15:15:42,TeapotOfDoom,i actually know a guy named Pixel
05-01-2020T15:16:18,TeapotOfDoom,his mom went through the process of getting the name approved and honestly it's not even a bad name
05-01-2020T15:16:37,TeapotOfDoom,it's his second so he could still go with his first one if he wanted
05-01-2020T15:17:12,TeapotOfDoom,I don't think i would call my kid pixel but it's a neat name for a cat
05-01-2020T15:17:25,TeapotOfDoom,also computer engineer so there's that
05-01-2020T15:17:34,CrimsonQuill,One of my names is from my father's middle names
05-01-2020T15:17:53,CrimsonQuill,My first name is after one of the Irish Saints and a school freind my dad had.
05-01-2020T15:18:06,CrimsonQuill,And my surname is Anglo-French
05-01-2020T15:18:15,CrimsonQuill,Names are interesting...
05-01-2020T15:18:19,TeapotOfDoom,Indeed
05-01-2020T15:18:49,CrimsonQuill,I've decided one thing about SCP-TeapotOfDoom
05-01-2020T15:18:52,CrimsonQuill,It's gonna be safe
05-01-2020T15:18:58,CrimsonQuill,Just an...interesting effect
05-01-2020T15:19:06,TeapotOfDoom,My parents just went for something rare that's a nice name
05-01-2020T15:19:14,TeapotOfDoom,so I'm pretty happy with mine
05-01-2020T15:19:15,CrimsonQuill,Rare names are nice.
05-01-2020T15:19:30,CrimsonQuill,It can suck when everyone else has the same name you do
05-01-2020T15:19:57,TeapotOfDoom,oh yeah xD
05-01-2020T15:20:03,CrimsonQuill,Anyhoo
05-01-2020T15:20:18,TeapotOfDoom,like so many people are named katharina or a vaiant thereof
05-01-2020T15:20:32,CrimsonQuill,True that
05-01-2020T15:20:43,CrimsonQuill,Where I am there are a lot of Dylans/Dillons
05-01-2020T15:21:10,TeapotOfDoom,also it would be funny if TPOD could be dangerous in just one completly unlikely situation
05-01-2020T15:21:14,CrimsonQuill,"In fact I was told that before my brother was born, my mum considerd calling him Dillon (if they were a boy)"
05-01-2020T15:21:34,CrimsonQuill,"Then, I'm told my dad saw an angsty mum draggin her kid along the road with that name"
05-01-2020T15:21:46,CrimsonQuill,"And he said ""We're not having a dylan!"
05-01-2020T15:21:55,CrimsonQuill,So my brother has a much nicer name instead.
05-01-2020T15:21:58,CrimsonQuill,:D
05-01-2020T15:22:33,CrimsonQuill,Anyhow
05-01-2020T15:22:55,CrimsonQuill,"I'm going to log off for the night. Make some tea, clear the bed, listen to music, read Twokinds..."
05-01-2020T15:23:06,CrimsonQuill,(I'm starting to wonder if I read it too often now)
05-01-2020T15:23:28,CrimsonQuill,"So, goodnight!"
05-01-2020T15:23:36,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-greetings::ptv-greetings::ptv-greetings:
05-01-2020T15:23:52,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-sleepy::ptv-sleepy::ptv-sleepy:

05-01-2020T19:58:58,RimaDraws,a gas station is no way to make money
05-01-2020T19:59:54,AspiringNoodle,Especially when it got bought out by a new coporation in march last year and just about everything took a downgrade
05-01-2020T20:00:15,AspiringNoodle,"One of the only upsides is that now we sell beer, and people have actually been cool about it"

05-01-2020T23:17:25,SpazztasticKiwi,because the chicken is gone
