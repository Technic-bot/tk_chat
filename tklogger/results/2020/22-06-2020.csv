22-06-2020T10:58:59,SpazztasticKiwi,the fact some are up changes nothing
22-06-2020T13:00:55,CrRAR,For some morning is the incomprehensible stupor between sleep time and coffee time.
22-06-2020T13:01:13,CrRAR,A barren and disorienting aether.

22-06-2020T20:33:01,SpazztasticKiwi,shoulder hurt
22-06-2020T20:33:04,SpazztasticKiwi,feet hurt
22-06-2020T20:46:38,RimaDraws,my kitty is tired from his parvo shot yesterday and sore
22-06-2020T20:53:46,SpazztasticKiwi,so my aunt is going to cali in July to see her dad
22-06-2020T21:02:47,RimaDraws,oh nice but i thought they were on strict lockdown
22-06-2020T21:14:04,SpazztasticKiwi,mark & ethans been doing videos together again for awhile now
22-06-2020T21:14:09,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe a week
22-06-2020T21:14:23,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs been liftedish
22-06-2020T21:14:49,RimaDraws,well i haven't caught up on unus annus in two months
22-06-2020T21:23:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"yeah, today mark tried his hand at old fashion shaving"
22-06-2020T21:25:00,SpazztasticKiwi,with Ethan as the guinea pig
22-06-2020T21:25:36,Ordithus,did ethan live
22-06-2020T21:27:15,CrRAR,it was... a close shave
22-06-2020T21:27:26,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-smug:
22-06-2020T21:27:33,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-flomad:
22-06-2020T21:27:46,RimaDraws,LOL
22-06-2020T21:29:11,CrRAR,Did they get to be covered in absurd amounts of shaving cream?
22-06-2020T21:29:50,CrRAR,Also if a barber-ish moustache twirl was not featured it ought to have been
22-06-2020T21:32:59,Dadrobit,"What... What is the difference between shaving and ""old fashioned"" shaving?"
22-06-2020T21:33:08,Dadrobit,"Like, did they use a straight razor?"
22-06-2020T21:33:53,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah
22-06-2020T21:34:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Ethan didn‚Äôt even have much hair on him
22-06-2020T21:35:16,CrRAR,That's the beauty of it though
22-06-2020T21:35:24,CrRAR,So precise
22-06-2020T21:35:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Ethan got to do Mark‚Äôs too but Mark asked him to clean his neckline
22-06-2020T21:35:44,SpazztasticKiwi,& the guy doesn‚Äôt like his neck touched so...
22-06-2020T21:35:50,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-zenshocked: ohno
22-06-2020T21:36:08,CrRAR,no. twitchies.
22-06-2020T21:36:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Ethan got near him with the lather brush and he was twitching
22-06-2020T21:37:03,CrRAR,"""the. LATHER."""
22-06-2020T21:38:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"I mean, you know they‚Äôre friends cause Mark‚Äôs ok with him doing this"
22-06-2020T21:38:51,SpazztasticKiwi,as clearly shown by his imitation of paranoid squirrel on expresso
22-06-2020T21:39:29,CrRAR,:ccrrar-chipr:
22-06-2020T21:39:38,CrRAR,The later so far is underwhelming
22-06-2020T21:39:48,CrRAR,lather
22-06-2020T21:39:54,CrRAR,I am unimpressed
22-06-2020T21:40:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt know why Mark‚Äôs pushing for this when he‚Äôs clearly wildly not ok with it
22-06-2020T21:40:51,SpazztasticKiwi,there‚Äôs harp strings less tense
22-06-2020T21:43:37,CrRAR,"Well on the bright side, the extra lather can probably double as Joker makeup."
22-06-2020T21:45:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not sure he took a single regular breath in that chair
22-06-2020T21:52:09,CrRAR,"haha, his death-grip on that table was something."
22-06-2020T21:52:33,CrRAR,Like how Captain America grips his helicopters~
22-06-2020T21:52:44,CrRAR,:ptv-ohmy:
22-06-2020T21:54:28,CrRAR,equally scary sharp blades involved too
22-06-2020T21:54:45,CrRAR,:helicopter:
22-06-2020T21:54:46,CrRAR,:boom:
22-06-2020T21:55:31,CrRAR,"In fact, you could add ""Dramatization"" to that scene, and it'd sum up this shaving video pretty well."
22-06-2020T21:56:59,CrRAR,At least that's probably basically how it went in his own head.
22-06-2020T22:04:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I fully expected that table to crack or something
22-06-2020T22:15:05,CrRAR,haha
