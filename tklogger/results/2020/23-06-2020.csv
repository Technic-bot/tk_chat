23-06-2020T00:59:52,AspiringNoodle,Hi rar~
23-06-2020T01:00:02,AspiringNoodle,I feel bad :c
23-06-2020T01:00:07,CrRAR,evenin
23-06-2020T01:00:13,CrRAR,"oh no, why?"
23-06-2020T01:00:25,AspiringNoodle,One of my coworkers is working an extra day this week
23-06-2020T01:00:42,AspiringNoodle,"I originally passed on it as a ""if they don't take it I will"""
23-06-2020T01:01:05,AspiringNoodle,"Because last week was heavy, and next week will be a bit heavier than normal thanks to my 2nd job hitting one of 2 days of the month"
23-06-2020T01:01:27,AspiringNoodle,"But it *completely* slipped my mind that after next week, if approved, I'd be off all week"
23-06-2020T01:02:55,CrRAR,ohh
23-06-2020T01:03:31,CrRAR,well tbh though seems like ok to not feel too guilty
23-06-2020T01:04:11,CrRAR,seems you commit enough time and energy other times to the job
23-06-2020T02:02:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I
23-06-2020T02:02:54,SpazztasticKiwi,have thought

23-06-2020T16:14:54,CrRAR,At least now that dead Kat emoji has a potentially more lighthearted backstory.
23-06-2020T16:15:14,CrRAR,Unsteddyâ€™s heart can fret no longer!
23-06-2020T19:12:46,RimaDraws,o.o
23-06-2020T19:16:01,SpazztasticKiwi,my flight got refunded
23-06-2020T19:36:58,CrRAR,score
23-06-2020T19:37:29,CrRAR,Better than a voucher
23-06-2020T19:37:43,CrRAR,or company credit or whatever
23-06-2020T20:25:30,SpazztasticKiwi,IM FREE
23-06-2020T20:26:27,RimaDraws,i only got credit...
23-06-2020T20:26:35,RimaDraws,cause it was economy
23-06-2020T20:27:19,SpazztasticKiwi,it was refunded because they rescheduled it with a more than 30 minute difference
23-06-2020T20:27:28,SpazztasticKiwi,the difference ended up being 2 hours
23-06-2020T21:38:32,Dadrobit,Well fuck. Another supervisor at work just announced he tested positive for Covid last Sunday. And I was riding in the truck with him all last week....
23-06-2020T21:40:19,CrRAR,"You'll be good though, right? You already had it."
23-06-2020T21:40:34,Dadrobit,Reinfection rates are pretty bad.
23-06-2020T21:41:01,CrRAR,ah yeah
23-06-2020T21:41:19,Dadrobit,And mortality among the reinfected is unreasonably high to boot. feelsbadman
23-06-2020T21:42:29,Dadrobit,"As I'm hearing it, Covid mutates super super quickly among populations, so the antibodies generated in the first go-round are ineffective against it in only a few months."
23-06-2020T21:42:38,CrRAR,"I'm just curious if it's a separate strain causing the reinfections, seems weird to me that in a specific geographic area you would think the same strain would be circulating."
23-06-2020T21:42:41,CrRAR,ah Isee
23-06-2020T21:42:52,CrRAR,How are their symptoms?
23-06-2020T21:43:06,Dadrobit,"But I'm no doctor, I'm just regurgitating second hand"
23-06-2020T21:43:14,CrRAR,Are they similar to what you experienced or is it COVIDlite?
23-06-2020T21:43:30,Dadrobit,"I don't know, all I got was a notification from the site commander."
23-06-2020T21:43:36,CrRAR,ah
23-06-2020T21:44:22,CrRAR,"Yeah it doesn't take much for a virus to mutate, just a simple change in the viral ""fingerprint"" and it looks like something different to our immune system"
23-06-2020T21:45:34,CrRAR,"It does make sense because early on the gov't was considering ""CovidSafe"" work cards for those who already were tested to have it, but like you said with reinfection it was scrapped because they fond that it would not be a reliable judge of safety."
23-06-2020T21:46:06,Dadrobit,Bonus points for my city being fucking retarded\
23-06-2020T21:46:21,CrRAR,It's so stupid to me how much of the info deemed unsavory is just hidden from the public or kept hush-hush
23-06-2020T21:46:22,Dadrobit,Almost every other city in AZ is enforcing mandatory masks
23-06-2020T21:47:00,CrRAR,"Yeah just basically in an effort to stoke ""fearless leader"" egos."
23-06-2020T21:47:08,Dadrobit,"Mine however is ""Taking a stand!"" and is not only not enforcing masks, they're actively reducing restrictions on letting people move freely and gather."
23-06-2020T21:48:20,CrRAR,haha
23-06-2020T21:50:56,Dadrobit,Speaking of... Time for work. Peace out y'all. Cya later!
23-06-2020T21:51:03,CrRAR,okay see ya

23-06-2020T22:30:54,AspiringNoodle,Yeah no...
23-06-2020T22:31:15,AspiringNoodle,"Spent a good chunk of the shift verifying that an unacceptably large amount of our ""sales"" weren't actually ringing up"
23-06-2020T22:35:37,AspiringNoodle,Today was sadly a prime example of one of my longest running complaints just becoming a parody of itself
23-06-2020T22:36:10,AspiringNoodle,"Every single beef jerky sale was not in the system, and in a lot of cases, the price tag out on the floor was showing a lower price than what the system rings up"
23-06-2020T22:36:29,AspiringNoodle,It's like... HOW?!? HOW CAN A STORE THIS SMALL MESS UP SO MANY ITEMS?!?
23-06-2020T22:36:46,AspiringNoodle,sorry to douche out on you ord
23-06-2020T22:36:53,AspiringNoodle,The frustration is real :ptv-whiny:
23-06-2020T22:39:37,Ordithus,is okay
