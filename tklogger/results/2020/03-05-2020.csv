03-05-2020T12:21:43,IronHorseComics,but do we?
03-05-2020T12:22:13,IronHorseComics,"one of his rules is NO SPOILERS, so if we know Natani lives, wouldn't that be a spoiler?"

03-05-2020T12:29:37,AspiringNoodle,"Iirc, the pic itself can't be a spoiler, i.e. it can't depict something that will happen later in the comic."

03-05-2020T15:31:42,SpazztasticKiwi,...you could go up in chat and read

03-05-2020T15:35:38,Dadrobit,Blehhgggh... Have to travel to West friggin Phoenix to turn in my FMLA paperwork because HR refuses to accept pictures of the paperwork as substitute. That's over an hour commute with no traffic each way... Just for some friggin paperwork...
03-05-2020T15:36:04,CrimsonQuill,...I still need to call welfare about my Isolation Benefit

03-05-2020T16:06:00,AspiringNoodle,"I was just thinking, ""How many more deaths before I've despawned the run here?"""
03-05-2020T16:06:01,CrimsonQuill,Hi jojo
03-05-2020T16:06:24,AspiringNoodle,"Dark Souls 2 has an annoying habit of crafting the levels so that if you die on a boss fight, there's some stuff you HAVE to fight."
03-05-2020T16:06:36,JojoGD,Should i draw kathrin in a serios pose of no?
03-05-2020T16:06:57,CrimsonQuill,Serious pose'd be cool
03-05-2020T16:06:59,CrimsonQuill,I'm t
03-05-2020T16:06:59,AspiringNoodle,"In DS1, I can only think of a few instances where that was the case.  For the most part, you could just run around enemies and ignore them.  DS2 doesn't let you do that"
03-05-2020T16:07:04,JojoGD,its just her serious showing her fist
03-05-2020T16:07:19,CrimsonQuill,I'm trying to figure out what colour pencils would work for the RvB sketch
03-05-2020T16:07:35,CrimsonQuill,"I am scared for DS enough as it is, Aspiring"
03-05-2020T16:07:58,CrimsonQuill,"So you're saying that in 2, you can't even kite enemies?"
03-05-2020T16:08:12,JojoGD,?
03-05-2020T16:10:39,CrimsonQuill,@JojoGD Talking to Aspiring and you at the same time
03-05-2020T16:10:48,CrimsonQuill,@JojoGD
03-05-2020T16:11:11,JojoGD,I mean like what r u guys talking about
03-05-2020T16:12:23,CrimsonQuill,Aspiring is talking about Dark Souls 2 to me
03-05-2020T16:12:36,CrimsonQuill,I'm trying to have 2 conversations at once
03-05-2020T16:12:40,CrimsonQuill,Drawing and videogames
03-05-2020T16:13:31,JojoGD,Is Dark Souls a PC game?
03-05-2020T16:13:52,CrimsonQuill,"PC, PS, Xbox"
03-05-2020T16:17:32,JojoGD,Oh
03-05-2020T16:18:24,AspiringNoodle,"In Dark Souls 2, there are some areas where the enemies move too fast / are too aggressive"
03-05-2020T16:18:48,AspiringNoodle,"And in DS2, you don't have invulnerability while entering fog gates (like 1 and 3, and even BB / Demon Souls, I think)"
03-05-2020T16:19:01,AspiringNoodle,"So if they are keeping pace and you try to enter the gate, they can stagger you and cancel the animation."
03-05-2020T16:19:18,JojoGD,Im one level away from beating all the main levels from Geometry Dash
03-05-2020T16:19:46,AspiringNoodle,"The runs leading to Lud & Zallen, and Sir Alonne are good examples."
03-05-2020T16:20:05,CrimsonQuill,I'm stuck on the colours for the RvB/Twokinds comic
03-05-2020T16:20:20,AspiringNoodle,It's ironic
03-05-2020T16:20:38,AspiringNoodle,The hardest boss fights tend to be the ones with the most insufferable run :ptv-laugh:
03-05-2020T16:21:01,JojoGD,Theory of everything 2 is going to be a pain to beat
03-05-2020T16:21:29,CrimsonQuill,"So, the bosses are basically covered with enemies..."
03-05-2020T16:25:11,AspiringNoodle,The game's just a bit punishing in many regards.
03-05-2020T16:25:31,AspiringNoodle,"The early game is arguably the hardest of any souls game, mainly because of questionable design decisions"
03-05-2020T16:25:49,CrimsonQuill,So...a true Dark Souls game?
03-05-2020T16:26:27,AspiringNoodle,"Not exactly.  In Dark Souls 1, Hidetaka Miyazaki's design philosophy was ""punishing but fair"""
03-05-2020T16:26:41,AspiringNoodle,"If they did something, it had a purpose (though some areas are STILL complete bs)"
03-05-2020T16:27:03,AspiringNoodle,"If a zone has multiple enemies that pull at once, it was designed that way"
03-05-2020T16:27:17,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, I see now. So, Dark Souls 2 has a more...rushed idea?"
03-05-2020T16:27:34,AspiringNoodle,Yes / no.  They slowed the game down a fair bit.
03-05-2020T16:27:52,AspiringNoodle,"Estus flasks heal over time, so you can still die while healing.  Rolling consumes a LOT of stamina"
03-05-2020T16:28:03,CrimsonQuill,Ah.
03-05-2020T16:28:27,AspiringNoodle,Most of DS2's bosses have been rather meh
03-05-2020T16:30:29,AspiringNoodle,"That's actually killed me more than anything, the heal over time"
03-05-2020T16:31:02,AspiringNoodle,"Many, many instances where I make an opening to heal, go through the slow drinking animation, start healing, then the enemy attacks and I didn't get back enough health to survive"
03-05-2020T16:31:26,CrimsonQuill,Yowch.
03-05-2020T16:31:32,AspiringNoodle,"That said, it's a decent game."
03-05-2020T16:32:07,AspiringNoodle,Biggest complaints are Soul Memory completely ruining coop / PvP without the use of a bandage fix
03-05-2020T16:32:17,AspiringNoodle,And durability for weapons being way too low.
03-05-2020T16:32:59,AspiringNoodle,"And if Soul Memory didn't exist, I might be able to waive all my other complaints (maybe aside from durability)"
03-05-2020T16:33:33,CrimsonQuill,"Wait, weapons break?"
03-05-2020T16:39:35,AspiringNoodle,"Yup, Dark Souls 2 has the fastest breaking equipment in the game, lol"
03-05-2020T16:40:11,AspiringNoodle,"Dark Souls 1 barely wears down gear.  Unless you forget to repair it every so often, you'd have to go through huge chunks of the game to risk a weapon breaking."
03-05-2020T16:40:39,AspiringNoodle,"Dark Souls 3 has durability more similar to 1, and everything repairs automatically when you rest at a bonfire."
03-05-2020T16:41:02,AspiringNoodle,"Dark Souls 2 introduced the repairing at the bonfire bit.  But weapons break so easily, you generally want at least 2 you can use, just in case."
03-05-2020T16:41:15,CrimsonQuill,Oh come on...
03-05-2020T16:41:30,CrimsonQuill,What sort of shoddy smithworking do they have there?>
03-05-2020T16:41:41,AspiringNoodle,My Red Rust Scimitar has 60 durability
03-05-2020T16:41:46,CrimsonQuill,"Call Burleigh and Stronginthearm, good quality smiths, those"
03-05-2020T16:42:00,AspiringNoodle,"When I killed Aava, the King's Pet solo, I had probably run through 85% of its durability on just a boss fight"
03-05-2020T16:42:12,CrimsonQuill,Oh come on
03-05-2020T16:42:21,AspiringNoodle,And this is AFTER they fixed the bugs
03-05-2020T16:42:40,AspiringNoodle,"When DS2 first came out, the game ran at 30 fps like DS1, but some versions could run at 60 fps"
03-05-2020T16:43:13,AspiringNoodle,"But the problem was the durability rate was based on per-frame contact.  So by doubling the FPS from 30 to 60, equipment wore down 2x as fast"
03-05-2020T16:43:22,AspiringNoodle,Which meant people were carrying 3 or 4 weapons to get through an area.
03-05-2020T16:44:23,CrimsonQuill,That's kinda like what happens in MCC at the moment.
03-05-2020T16:44:39,CrimsonQuill,"The higher the FPS, the more inaccurate your shots are."
03-05-2020T16:45:47,AspiringNoodle,"But good news, I am now at the final bosses of the game"
03-05-2020T16:46:05,CrimsonQuill,Nice work!
03-05-2020T16:46:06,AspiringNoodle,"Just gonna do some last minute shopping for my character, max everything out, then end the game, lol"
03-05-2020T16:46:13,CrimsonQuill,Well
03-05-2020T16:46:16,AspiringNoodle,See what fashion souls I end on
03-05-2020T16:46:25,CrimsonQuill,I'm going to play some Halo and go to bed
03-05-2020T16:46:31,JojoGD,nice
03-05-2020T16:46:35,CrimsonQuill,Work tomorrow-12:30 till 8pm
03-05-2020T16:46:50,CrimsonQuill,And try to figure out what colour pencils I use for the picture
03-05-2020T16:46:53,JojoGD,im going to do school work
03-05-2020T16:46:54,AspiringNoodle,"So yeah, once I kill Nashandra and finish this playthrough, I'll uninstall Dark Souls 2 and then at some point start playing 3 :D"
03-05-2020T16:47:13,CrimsonQuill,"Seriously, @JojoGD, how do you make your pencils so smooth?"
03-05-2020T16:47:46,JojoGD,Which pencil work
03-05-2020T16:47:51,CrimsonQuill,The Raine one
03-05-2020T16:47:57,CrimsonQuill,The pencils are so smoothly done!
03-05-2020T16:48:03,CrimsonQuill,Proper solid colour.
03-05-2020T16:48:09,CrimsonQuill,Not scratchy shading like me.
03-05-2020T16:48:26,CrimsonQuill,And a much better idea of shading hair.
03-05-2020T16:48:48,CrimsonQuill,With Crayola pencils!

03-05-2020T16:50:12,CrimsonQuill,Just...How do you do it without just ruining the paper by pressing down on it?
03-05-2020T16:50:36,CrimsonQuill,"Is it to do with pencil sharpness? I always keep colouring pencils very sharp and pointy, is that a bad idea?"
03-05-2020T16:51:13,JojoGD,I hardly ever use color pencil. Im not the best person to ask
03-05-2020T16:51:42,CrimsonQuill,But the shading on the hair!
03-05-2020T16:51:54,CrimsonQuill,The colours were clean and sharp!
03-05-2020T16:52:22,JojoGD,I sharpen my pencil and use fast precise strokes
03-05-2020T16:52:27,CrimsonQuill,Uuuuujhhhh
03-05-2020T16:52:38,CrimsonQuill,Any...any tutorial videos I can watch?
03-05-2020T16:52:44,CrimsonQuill,Because...I am not good at precision.
