12-06-2020T00:58:09,Dadrobit,They're good. Had some a few months back when I visited the parents.
12-06-2020T00:58:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I despised twizzlers
12-06-2020T00:58:28,CrRAR,nice
12-06-2020T00:58:31,SpazztasticKiwi,but the strawberry...
12-06-2020T00:58:39,CrRAR,2/2 streamers agree!

12-06-2020T00:58:49,SpazztasticKiwi,sweet and soft and chewy without being tooth glue
12-06-2020T00:58:58,CrRAR,wow

12-06-2020T00:59:10,CrRAR,they really hit a chord
12-06-2020T00:59:36,Dadrobit,Gonna guess citric acid?
12-06-2020T00:59:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I can feel that my breath smells like the inside of a cake
12-06-2020T01:00:06,CrRAR,ghaddang scurvy fruits
12-06-2020T01:00:21,CrRAR,that's impressive
12-06-2020T01:01:12,CrRAR,sounds moist and decadent
12-06-2020T01:03:37,SageSaga,i dont like cherry twizzlers is what stops me from having twizzlers :P
12-06-2020T01:03:54,SpazztasticKiwi,me either

12-06-2020T01:04:51,SpazztasticKiwi,orange and cream?
12-06-2020T01:04:51,CrRAR,"Like when I shop for twizzlers, I just want ""original"""
12-06-2020T01:04:53,SageSaga,which i found while looking for the strawberry one
12-06-2020T01:04:56,SpazztasticKiwi,like sherbert?
12-06-2020T01:04:57,CrRAR,Which is strawberry

12-06-2020T01:07:44,SageSaga,i know some people dont like root beer- i get it- but i like it- it's nostalgic
12-06-2020T01:07:44,SpazztasticKiwi,walmart carries it
12-06-2020T01:07:52,Dadrobit,o/
12-06-2020T01:07:57,SageSaga,cant go there- walmart has the covid
12-06-2020T01:08:06,AspiringNoodle,^ Can confirm
12-06-2020T01:08:08,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-sleepy:
12-06-2020T01:08:23,CrRAR,I was shopping the soda isle and I saw Dr Pepper now has cream soda and I'm like... I would not buy Dr Pepper Cream soda.
12-06-2020T01:08:31,CrRAR,Whay so many choices there days?
12-06-2020T01:08:31,SpazztasticKiwi,yours should unless it’s one of those special odd things for your walmart that all surrounding stores have but yours doesn’t
12-06-2020T01:08:50,SpazztasticKiwi,my sister gets the cream soda ones
12-06-2020T01:08:52,CrRAR,Like every company now thinks it has to do EVERYTHING
12-06-2020T01:08:58,CrRAR,that needs to stop
12-06-2020T01:08:59,SpazztasticKiwi,it tastes like a heavier dr pepper
12-06-2020T01:09:02,Dadrobit,"I mean, I'd try cream Dr pepper."
12-06-2020T01:09:18,SpazztasticKiwi,🗞
12-06-2020T01:09:28,CrRAR,it's probably not horrible I like Dr Pepper
12-06-2020T01:09:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"hear ye hear ye, it’s in stores now 📰"
12-06-2020T01:09:52,CrRAR,Dr Pep though does have f-tons of sugar
12-06-2020T01:09:57,SpazztasticKiwi,what it likely amounts to is more sugar
12-06-2020T01:10:01,Dadrobit,"Yeah, Dr. Pepper is probably my favorite soft drink."
12-06-2020T01:10:02,CrRAR,like even more than the rest
12-06-2020T01:10:10,SpazztasticKiwi,props why it tastes heavier
12-06-2020T01:10:14,CrRAR,yeah
12-06-2020T01:10:15,SpazztasticKiwi,probs
12-06-2020T01:10:32,CrRAR,Yeah for a while Dr Pepper is all I would ever get
12-06-2020T01:10:36,SpazztasticKiwi,this song reminds me of those foxes in sing
12-06-2020T01:10:48,WINDOWS98SE,I like Dr. Pepper Cream Soda.
12-06-2020T01:10:54,WINDOWS98SE,Goes well with scotch.
12-06-2020T01:11:00,CrRAR,I just remember the flamboyant pig
12-06-2020T01:11:09,CrRAR,nice
12-06-2020T01:11:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t scotch
12-06-2020T01:11:30,Dadrobit,"As a kid, it was all dad would let us have. Every once in a while we'd go to Taco Bell and all share a small Dr. Pepper. So it has always had this spot in my head that tells me it's a ""treat""."
12-06-2020T01:11:58,SageSaga,i have only ever bought alcohol once- and it was a bottle of cake vodka
12-06-2020T01:12:03,SageSaga,it was not for me
12-06-2020T01:12:10,Dadrobit,Oof
12-06-2020T01:12:12,CrRAR,"wow, that's a hell of an intro"
12-06-2020T01:12:13,SageSaga,as in i did not buy it for myself- i dont drink
12-06-2020T01:12:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I tasted a sip of corona lite
12-06-2020T01:12:37,SpazztasticKiwi,nah
12-06-2020T01:12:39,SageSaga,i bought it as a gift for a friend- she loves the stuff XD
12-06-2020T01:12:46,CrRAR,beer icky
12-06-2020T01:13:12,CrRAR,not all though
12-06-2020T01:13:15,SpazztasticKiwi,can say I’m not an alcohol person
12-06-2020T01:13:16,Dadrobit,I can always taste the fermentation in beer. Not my jive.
12-06-2020T01:13:19,CrRAR,there are classy brews
12-06-2020T01:13:28,CrRAR,with substance and depth
12-06-2020T01:13:29,SageSaga,she mixes it of course- doesnt drink it straight- but she says it turns almost anything into a liquid birthday cake and gets ya drunk XD
12-06-2020T01:13:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"so Sage, your stores not carry beer twizzlers or do you not know"
12-06-2020T01:14:17,SageSaga,i dont know Kiwi- i cant go check right now or any time soon due to the Covid being at the store
12-06-2020T01:14:27,SpazztasticKiwi,online?
12-06-2020T01:14:30,Dadrobit,"Can confirm, that is the purpose of flavoured vodkas."
12-06-2020T01:14:36,SageSaga,on...line?
12-06-2020T01:14:48,SageSaga,my local stores dont do the online thing

12-06-2020T01:14:58,SpazztasticKiwi,yes. most stores now have shop at home options
12-06-2020T01:15:05,WINDOWS98SE,(Flora drinking Corona).
12-06-2020T01:15:09,SageSaga,"even the walmart is like ""Just call us or come by"""
12-06-2020T01:15:39,SpazztasticKiwi,your area must have its feathers more ruffled
12-06-2020T01:15:53,CrRAR,I like Flora's hat looks like pizza
12-06-2020T01:16:00,SpazztasticKiwi,my area still has packaged food online for order
12-06-2020T01:16:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Florona

12-06-2020T01:21:34,CrRAR,"ahem, excuse me $6.99. it's crazy. Toppings still cost though"
12-06-2020T01:22:25,Dadrobit,Fu-huuuuck. That reminds me. I need to hit up my local Thai place before Douchey orders another half ass state lockdown...
12-06-2020T01:22:50,CrRAR,oh jeez yeah I heard about 'zona
12-06-2020T01:22:59,CrRAR,Lots of states though too
12-06-2020T01:23:15,CrRAR,America's on the path for a 2nd lockdown xD
12-06-2020T01:23:40,Dadrobit,Yup. Hospitals are max capacity and we keep setting new records for infection rates almost every day.
12-06-2020T01:25:31,CrRAR,"Yeah, it's not unique though either, I think Cali's in the same boat and they have been doing things responsibly but have been pushing to get going economically again."
12-06-2020T01:25:49,CrRAR,their numbers don't look good either
12-06-2020T01:26:11,Dadrobit,"Imagine Cali, but without the whole ""responsibly"" concept. You have the AZ govt."
12-06-2020T01:26:17,CrRAR,haha
12-06-2020T01:26:27,CrRAR,"""Ehhh, we'll wing it!"""
12-06-2020T01:27:01,SageSaga,Considering the population density on Cali they are doing pretty good

12-06-2020T01:27:48,SageSaga,Arizona is known for it's stupidity in government
12-06-2020T01:27:56,Dadrobit,The scientists coordinating the response are saying shits really bad? Fire the scientists.
12-06-2020T01:28:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"“he don’t agree with me, replace him”"
12-06-2020T01:29:49,Dadrobit,"We set multiple records this past week, and their response was literally and I quote, ""We really aren't that concerned."""
12-06-2020T01:31:05,CrRAR,I just been watching the national serious/critical cases and it just hovers around 17000 despite the mortality that's been happening.

12-06-2020T01:33:01,Dadrobit,You got it!
12-06-2020T01:33:33,Dadrobit,He's as ancient as the hills and he's trying to run for office again.

12-06-2020T01:39:54,Dadrobit,"CrRar. It's funny you say that. Just before the impeachment process, McSally was asked, ""are you going to take the evidence of the president's wrongdoing in consideration for your vote?"" Her answer was, ""I'm not going to speak to you you liberal hack!"""
12-06-2020T01:40:32,Dadrobit,My blood literally boils knowing she lost her election and had Zero right to be in her position.
12-06-2020T01:42:14,SageSaga,my blood figuratively boils when people use literally like that
12-06-2020T01:42:41,Dadrobit,You underestimate my heat resistance!
12-06-2020T01:44:02,SageSaga,you over estimate your bodies ability to produce heat

12-06-2020T01:44:59,Dadrobit,"But yeah. Can't wait for Mark Kelly. McSally's entire campaign was essentially, ""I'm a republican fighter pilot"". Kelly is that and a motherfuckin astronaut to boot!"

12-06-2020T01:51:35,SpazztasticKiwi,same here
12-06-2020T01:51:55,Dadrobit,"And she's a literal damned scientist. Like, how did you come to this?"
12-06-2020T01:52:22,Dadrobit,"""we'll both sides are just as bad, but one wants to save babies from being murdered!"""
12-06-2020T01:52:25,SageSaga,"shes like ""Bill Clinton was sleeping around with women!"" ""Trump literally paid off a porn star he was banging while his wife was pregnant"""
12-06-2020T01:55:18,SageSaga,i still want to throw Jimmy Carter in her face at some point XD
12-06-2020T01:56:09,SageSaga,she liked Carter- and she doesnt see a problem with Trump still owning all his businesses and profiting from them while hes president-
12-06-2020T01:56:22,SageSaga,when Carter sold his peanut farm!
12-06-2020T01:57:19,SageSaga,has someone collected a list of all the illegal things Trump has done and provided sources?
12-06-2020T01:58:22,Dadrobit,Meanwhile Trump is constantly golfing at his own resorts to the tune of tens of millions of dollars in expenses paid for by us.
12-06-2020T01:59:08,Dadrobit,"Yeah, you see giant lists here and there on Reddit, I don't have one saved for you at the moment though."
12-06-2020T01:59:21,SageSaga,oh it was the Emoluments Clause
12-06-2020T01:59:43,SageSaga,that was like the first thing he technically broke right?
12-06-2020T01:59:47,Dadrobit,"Yep, that's the one for private gains while in office right?"
12-06-2020T02:00:17,Dadrobit,It had to be one of the first.
12-06-2020T02:00:38,SageSaga,it prohibits government officials from taking payments or gifts from foreign governments or businesses
12-06-2020T02:01:26,SageSaga,so if you have an international business that you profit from you have to either put it in a blind trust to someone else or get rid of it before you take your position
12-06-2020T02:01:57,SageSaga,but all he did was put his kids in charge of the business- hes still the owner and profiteer
12-06-2020T02:03:42,Dadrobit,"Shit, his kids and his in-laws consist of half the cabinet of the executive branch to boot. You think they have time to run a bunch of 2 star resorts on top of all that?"
12-06-2020T02:04:30,SageSaga,yeah that again- they are government officials now too- which means they are also breaking the law
12-06-2020T02:04:44,SageSaga,wow- the whole family can just go to jail...
12-06-2020T02:05:41,Dadrobit,"Even better when you learn that the family couldn't pass the requirements for top secret clearance, and yet they still have access."
12-06-2020T02:06:44,SageSaga,well off of politics- i tried the setup with Reaper
12-06-2020T02:07:23,Dadrobit,I remember early on in the presidency when it was announced that they were forced to evacuate a ton of secret agents out of foreign lands because there were too many leaks from Trump's family and friends.
12-06-2020T02:07:30,Dadrobit,Oh?
12-06-2020T02:07:59,Dadrobit,"If you need some help, I can get on tomorrow night."
12-06-2020T02:08:02,SageSaga,yeah- you dont need OBS for any of it- not sure why ya added that step
12-06-2020T02:08:08,SageSaga,its not gonna work though
12-06-2020T02:08:35,Dadrobit,"Hm, Reaper wasn't playing nice with Discord for me at least. What's up?"
12-06-2020T02:09:23,SageSaga,it works fine for adjusting pitch and reverb- but it cant provide enough modulation- nothing can really without post processing- also even with skipping OBS the lag is pretty bad
12-06-2020T02:10:47,SageSaga,so the modulation needed to make it good enough to use- isnt possible live it seems
12-06-2020T02:10:51,Dadrobit,The lag can be tuned up a bit. But I'm not sure what you mean by post processing?
12-06-2020T02:11:08,Dadrobit,"Oh, as in rendering?"
12-06-2020T02:11:42,SageSaga,yeah you would need to run some kind of filter through it or use an AI to mod the wave form to really change the voice
12-06-2020T02:12:11,SageSaga,shifting pitch and such isnt enough to make voices different- and i cant voice act well enough to make up for it
12-06-2020T02:12:50,Dadrobit,Did you try sticking to formant alone? Pitch shifting I find is often too harsh.
12-06-2020T02:13:00,SageSaga,yes it doesnt matter
12-06-2020T02:13:21,SageSaga,they both cant shift without distortion and make it sound different enough
12-06-2020T02:13:43,SageSaga,it's just way too complex
12-06-2020T02:14:04,SageSaga,the most useful thing from it would just be the Reverb for some dramatic sounds XD
12-06-2020T02:14:28,SageSaga,this also means the GoXLR wont work any better though
12-06-2020T02:14:42,Dadrobit,"NGL, I fell in love with that built in IR Verb plug-in in Reaper when I was experimenting."
12-06-2020T02:14:46,SageSaga,i mean the goXLR would be eaiser and provide other useful things- but not at that price
12-06-2020T02:15:21,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I was gonna say. Goxlr is almost certainly just working off the same exact principals."
12-06-2020T02:16:16,SageSaga,it does have an auto tuner
12-06-2020T02:16:30,SageSaga,and i could use that to modulate the voice with some kind of noise
12-06-2020T02:16:34,Dadrobit,Would you mind popping into a chat with me over the weekend sometime? I'd like to give a listen and see if I can't maybe make some tweaks.
12-06-2020T02:16:59,Dadrobit,Does it??? I must have missed that. Like a melodyne?
12-06-2020T02:17:00,SageSaga,i spent plenty of time with it- and did some research- its just not possible
12-06-2020T02:17:03,SageSaga,to get what i want
12-06-2020T02:17:36,Dadrobit,"Oh wait, I think I do know. Is it the one that looks like a piano keyboard?"
12-06-2020T02:17:37,SageSaga,the GoXLR has an autotune that can listen to an audio track and match the tones
12-06-2020T02:17:56,Dadrobit,ReaTune iirc
12-06-2020T02:17:59,SageSaga,im sure you can do the same with Reaper- but even that wouldnt do what im looking for
12-06-2020T02:18:12,SageSaga,also trying ReaTune crashed reaper XD
12-06-2020T02:18:18,Dadrobit,RIP
12-06-2020T02:19:12,Dadrobit,No crashes for me so far. I did have to restart once because ReaVerb didn't update my settings and added a permanent pre-delay.
12-06-2020T02:19:45,SageSaga,im sure i just pushed something i didnt know what it did too far that caused it
12-06-2020T02:20:10,SageSaga,but i couldnt figure it out- i assume its because it either cant do it live or it needs an audio source to pull from
12-06-2020T02:20:51,SageSaga,but yeah- Live Voice Changing just doesnt really exist- you can manipulate parts of it but it doesnt change your voice
12-06-2020T02:21:06,Dadrobit,"That does bring up an interesting, if perhaps limited option. If all you need is a speech, you could just pre-record it and play it at the right moment. But yes, that would drastically reduce the party interactivity."
12-06-2020T02:21:55,SageSaga,prerecording is just not an option unless they are legit listening to like a ghostly sound XD
12-06-2020T02:22:04,Dadrobit,It's almost certainly the second option. Live pitch fixing software is $$$
12-06-2020T02:23:11,SageSaga,i think you would need one of those AI programs and it still isnt live
12-06-2020T02:23:22,Dadrobit,Even just dedicated post-processing pitch fixing software is $$
12-06-2020T02:23:27,SageSaga,you speak into it- and then it takes a second to process it- and then plays it back
12-06-2020T02:25:11,SageSaga,you also need to feed it a voice to begin with
12-06-2020T02:25:28,SageSaga,so i would need to like find a bunch of movies with elves and dwarves talking and have it learn them-
12-06-2020T02:26:52,Dadrobit,"Out of curiosity, what's the status of your computer? DAW's, even Reaper, are absurdly processing intensive programs."
12-06-2020T02:27:05,SageSaga,Near God Tier
12-06-2020T02:27:27,Dadrobit,"Then yeah, you should have no issues."
12-06-2020T02:27:42,Dadrobit,No core limitations at least.
12-06-2020T02:28:16,SageSaga,12 core processor
12-06-2020T02:28:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Nighty night, thanks for the stream Sage <3"
12-06-2020T02:28:31,SageSaga,take care Marv
12-06-2020T02:28:54,Dadrobit,I remember thinking Pro Tools was a shit program when I was first learning because we always had it crashing and running up the processor and available ram until it crashed.
12-06-2020T02:29:00,Dadrobit,o/ Marv
12-06-2020T02:29:30,Dadrobit,"Made my own workstation and wouldn't ya know it, the Macs at school were the issue."
12-06-2020T02:31:00,Dadrobit,Brand new (2016-ish) iMac Pros were just not up to the task or running 100+ heavily modified audio tracks and a video player at the same time.
12-06-2020T02:31:51,Dadrobit,I cannot tell you how many times I cursed that spinning beach ball failure.
12-06-2020T02:32:27,Dadrobit,Of running*
12-06-2020T02:34:04,SageSaga,well since im not getting a GoXLR im again looking at replacing this tablet
12-06-2020T02:34:21,SageSaga,im getting sick of pressing this button a thousand times a night
12-06-2020T02:34:25,Dadrobit,"Ah yeah, it was having detection issues right?"
12-06-2020T02:35:24,SageSaga,yeah- it's still stopping me mid stroke to move the screen with my palm even though my pen is pressing on the screen
12-06-2020T02:36:47,SageSaga,problem is the tablet i want is way too expensive
12-06-2020T02:38:08,Dadrobit,Gonna go out on a limb and guess it's a Wacom product?
12-06-2020T02:38:21,SageSaga,of course
12-06-2020T02:38:34,SageSaga,nothing else matches em still =_=
12-06-2020T02:42:27,SageSaga,2600USD
12-06-2020T02:45:36,Dadrobit,I don't think I could ever spend that much money on something that wasn't a car or house payment...
12-06-2020T02:46:42,SageSaga,the trick is - it is a mobile tablet
12-06-2020T02:46:47,SageSaga,so its a computer
12-06-2020T02:46:53,SageSaga,and a wacom tablet
12-06-2020T02:48:35,Dadrobit,That's a lot of trust.
12-06-2020T02:49:10,Dadrobit,That something on the computer side won't go fucky on you and make the whole thing a brick.
12-06-2020T02:49:50,SageSaga,thats what warranties are for
12-06-2020T02:50:12,Dadrobit,"Then again, here I am salivating at the thought of, ""one day I'll have my very own U87 microphone!"""
12-06-2020T02:50:28,SageSaga,besides- what makes this one so good is if the computer side stopped working for whatever reason- it can also act as a display tablet on my pc
12-06-2020T02:50:33,Dadrobit,$3600
12-06-2020T02:52:03,Dadrobit,"I dunno, I guess I'd have to ask myself ""how often do I find myself out and about thinking, 'man I wish I could draw right now!'""."
12-06-2020T02:52:27,SageSaga,every convention
12-06-2020T02:53:18,SageSaga,=_= i should really just get a new standard cintiq and buy an ipad pro
12-06-2020T02:53:20,Dadrobit,"Sure, but again, that's X times per year. And there's always the option of a laptop and regular tablet no?"
12-06-2020T02:53:45,Dadrobit,"Oh, I've heard good things about using the pro as a dedicated tablet."
12-06-2020T02:54:52,SageSaga,laptop and a wacom is a no go
12-06-2020T02:55:17,SageSaga,"it can ""work"" but it's a mess of a setup and their cables suck"
12-06-2020T02:55:56,ZRO4825,"Can confirm, even with my XP-PEN, which isn't even considered a notable brand right now, cables are everywhere, lol"
12-06-2020T02:56:07,Dadrobit,Does Wacom not do that whole 3 cables into one dealy-o?
12-06-2020T02:56:18,SageSaga,also the ipad would be used for other things too
12-06-2020T02:56:46,SageSaga,the only reason i dont just get an ipad though is because clip studio on ipad-... is a subscription
12-06-2020T02:56:47,Dadrobit,(was looking at an xp-pen for myself actually)
12-06-2020T02:57:06,Dadrobit,Ouch. Not a fun environment to get sucked into.
12-06-2020T02:57:09,ZRO4825,"XP-PEN does do the 3 in 1, but it's still a pretty decent hassle, lol"
12-06-2020T02:57:38,SageSaga,i already own 2 legit copies of Clip studio- i will happily buy another- but not a subscription
12-06-2020T02:59:24,Dadrobit,"That's why I was looking into Reaper as well. I'm fine with a subscription that I can write off, but now that I'm not actively working with it ..."
12-06-2020T02:59:44,SageSaga,but yeah- a new wacom tablet will cost me 800 bucks for basically what i have now minus some buttons i like-
12-06-2020T03:00:07,SageSaga,and an ipad pro will cost 1200 with the pen
12-06-2020T03:00:42,Dadrobit,And I'd finally have access to surround sound manipulation WITHOUT paying $800 a year...
12-06-2020T03:01:41,Dadrobit,$800 for a good tablet is way more reasonable.
12-06-2020T03:01:57,SageSaga,but its the same tablet i have now but with features missing T_T
12-06-2020T03:02:22,Dadrobit,No on-tablet hotkeys?
12-06-2020T03:02:30,SageSaga,yep
12-06-2020T03:03:12,ZRO4825,They took away part of the buttons? wth.
12-06-2020T03:03:46,Dadrobit,Dumb question because I'm sure you looked. But there are no new in box sales of your old tablet on Amazon or something like that?
12-06-2020T03:05:55,SageSaga,found one- used though-
12-06-2020T03:06:02,Dadrobit,Risky
12-06-2020T03:06:18,SageSaga,600 dollars
12-06-2020T03:07:10,Dadrobit,"Could be great, could be a mess. Guaranteed there are a bunch of folks who bought Wacom thinking it'd make them an artist who only used it three times and are trying to recoup."
12-06-2020T03:07:11,SageSaga,they have 2- 1 used for 600 and one used for 750
12-06-2020T03:07:30,SageSaga,the 750 one is like new listing
12-06-2020T03:07:38,ZRO4825,"Dadro, oof, low blow! :joy:"
12-06-2020T03:07:55,Dadrobit,Same happens in audio all the time. $1300 mics going for half the price.
12-06-2020T03:08:06,ZRO4825,lol

12-06-2020T03:08:44,Dadrobit,Cue the $900 listing on eBay.
12-06-2020T03:10:56,SageSaga,i have a blutooth controller i can use for buttons with the new one T_T
12-06-2020T03:11:06,Dadrobit,"In the audio gear world, ""used older products"" get listed as ""Vintage"" and have their prices marked up lol."
12-06-2020T03:11:29,SageSaga,lol if i have to i can do art commands with the nintendo switch pro controller
12-06-2020T03:11:49,Dadrobit,Pfft lol
12-06-2020T03:14:57,SageSaga,done!
12-06-2020T03:15:02,BadFoMo,Cool.
12-06-2020T03:16:02,ZRO4825,Nice ^_^
12-06-2020T03:16:41,ZRO4825,The sadness when your pocky melted just enough to get all stuck together. :(
12-06-2020T03:16:57,SageSaga,you get megapocky then
12-06-2020T03:17:29,ZRO4825,lol
12-06-2020T03:18:02,Dadrobit,"Right on, Sage."
12-06-2020T03:18:57,Dadrobit,Haven't had Pocky in a few years. Kinda almost want some now.
12-06-2020T03:19:22,SageSaga,i want rootbeer float candy
12-06-2020T03:20:03,SpazztasticKiwi,dude that was like an hour ago
12-06-2020T03:22:33,SageSaga,i havent had soda of any kind in like 6 years
12-06-2020T03:24:01,Dadrobit,Mostly kept to my resolution for no soda so far this year. Just a few slip ups going out to eat without thinking about it.
12-06-2020T03:28:08,ZRO4825,I've been trying to wean myself back off of it. Down to only at most a 20 oz bottle a day. Except today I randomly got a large drink with my meal of cherry coke.
12-06-2020T03:28:40,ZRO4825,That sentence was phrased terribly. :joy: I must be more tired than I thought.

12-06-2020T13:31:34,AspiringNoodle,But it is super annoying to hear customers complain about these masks when odds are they only have to wear them while out shopping
12-06-2020T13:32:27,AspiringNoodle,TL;DR - I don't have much faith in America when the time for a worse pandemic rolls around
12-06-2020T13:32:54,AspiringNoodle,People are probably gonna downplay it because of COVID until it's too late and the damage will be yuuuuuuuuuuge

12-06-2020T14:05:48,SageSaga,very spotty XD
12-06-2020T14:06:01,SageSaga,"usually its just like ""Naaah- REEEEEEEEED"""
12-06-2020T14:07:37,BadFoMo,"I would tell it to make up its mind, but I feel that would jinx it and put it in constent red."
12-06-2020T14:15:14,AspiringNoodle,Wait
12-06-2020T14:15:25,AspiringNoodle,So you're saying you normally have a [database error] in your connection?
12-06-2020T14:15:47,SageSaga,ty- that was the worse joke ive heard all week
12-06-2020T14:16:02,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-hearts:
12-06-2020T14:17:20,AspiringNoodle,"So dadro, you're putting your chips in the ""COVID deaths are underreported"" camp?"
12-06-2020T14:18:46,SageSaga,that seems to be what the majority of trusted doctors and scientist are saying
12-06-2020T14:21:12,SageSaga,"but you shouldnt call it ""putting your chips in"" - that makes it sound like a bet- which it isnt- once the data is more appropriately collected over time and issues resolved we will have a better idea and then you can change your opinion based on new info"
12-06-2020T14:22:30,SageSaga,"people need to understand that science is a process that grows - one year you might find out that something is poisonous and you need to avoid it, only for it to be combined with something else and turn out to be a remedy to something more dangerous"
12-06-2020T14:23:50,AspiringNoodle,Except health science
12-06-2020T14:24:00,AspiringNoodle,That field a joke :D
12-06-2020T14:24:40,SageSaga,you mean dietary science or medical science?
12-06-2020T14:24:50,AspiringNoodle,"dietary, aka ""food"", science"
12-06-2020T14:24:57,AspiringNoodle,Even if you can even call it that
12-06-2020T14:25:11,AspiringNoodle,"Ugh, COVID has turned my brain to mush"
12-06-2020T14:25:17,SageSaga,you can- because it does exist but it's filled with bad faith actors
12-06-2020T14:25:22,AspiringNoodle,I'm repeated words / sentence fragments more often than normal
12-06-2020T14:25:37,SageSaga,did you contract Covid?
12-06-2020T14:25:38,AspiringNoodle,And now my grammar is failing
12-06-2020T14:25:50,AspiringNoodle,No I have not
12-06-2020T14:25:58,AspiringNoodle,I've simply contracted the stupidity of the whole situation
12-06-2020T14:26:00,SageSaga,then it is not responsible for your mush brain
12-06-2020T14:26:23,AspiringNoodle,"I want to say, good job [insert state name] lottery, I am officially against you now!"
12-06-2020T14:26:57,AspiringNoodle,"My state shuttered the casinos a while back, but didn't shut down the lottery"
12-06-2020T14:26:59,SageSaga,you aren't already anti-lotto?
12-06-2020T14:27:04,AspiringNoodle,So guess where all the gambling addicts went
12-06-2020T14:27:26,AspiringNoodle,I'm slowly becoming more anti-lotto
12-06-2020T14:27:49,SageSaga,they say a lot of that money goes to fund schools- they lied
12-06-2020T14:28:10,AspiringNoodle,"In my state, it's programs for senior citizens"
12-06-2020T14:28:19,AspiringNoodle,But guess which group tends to play it more than others...
12-06-2020T14:28:23,FoxxTrotter,:cfoxxtrotter-FoxEye:
12-06-2020T14:28:35,AspiringNoodle,*boops the foxxo on the snoot*
12-06-2020T14:28:40,SageSaga,most places they say the funds are supposed to go to get diverted and are never fixed
12-06-2020T14:28:59,AspiringNoodle,I found out not that long ago that lotto was sold to state government on a flipping lie
12-06-2020T14:29:28,AspiringNoodle,"The promise was that state lottery could bring in HUGE amounts of funds per year, but they only fund about 3% at best"
12-06-2020T14:30:15,AspiringNoodle,"Combine that with the fact that state lotto isn't as heavily regulated as gambling, even though that's what it literally is, and you've got a recipe for private business being more heavily regulated than the flippin' government!"
12-06-2020T14:31:27,AspiringNoodle,"So, state governments want their damn lotto so bad?  Age restrict that to 21.  Limit it to age restricted buildings"
12-06-2020T14:31:45,AspiringNoodle,"I see so many customers play ""scratchies"" *often*"
12-06-2020T14:32:27,SageSaga,lottos prey on the poor mostly
12-06-2020T14:32:37,SageSaga,mostly is probably an understatement
12-06-2020T14:32:57,SageSaga,rich people dont need to spend money every week on the hopes of winning it big XD
12-06-2020T14:33:04,AspiringNoodle,"It is, because statistics show that those who really can't afford to be blowing extra money on the lottery are the ones most likely to do so"
12-06-2020T14:33:36,AspiringNoodle,"3 groups that play the most: addicts (duh), elderly (time killer / disposable income), poor (hopes of a better future)"
12-06-2020T14:33:40,SageSaga,imagine Bill Gates winning the Lotto
12-06-2020T14:33:48,Dadrobit,Back for a second before more bed.
12-06-2020T14:33:57,BadFoMo,Yo.
12-06-2020T14:34:10,SageSaga,yo Bad
12-06-2020T14:34:43,Dadrobit,"TBH, if you're gonna blow your money on a chance to win more, at least do something like play some Texas Hold em."
12-06-2020T14:34:47,AspiringNoodle,"Prime example of how problematic scratch-offs can be: I have one customer.  Bigger guy, Italian, a bit demanding but overall nice"
12-06-2020T14:35:12,AspiringNoodle,"He plays almost $20 and $30 exclusively, with the occassional $10 if they're the kind that dabble in smaller prizes"
12-06-2020T14:35:29,Dadrobit,"Also, I am now suuuuuper nostalgic for my poker night circle...."
12-06-2020T14:35:44,AspiringNoodle,"The way he plays, he goes until there's a decent winner that nets him a nice profit, or covers the sunk cost of the night's purchases"
12-06-2020T14:36:24,AspiringNoodle,But this also ties into one of the reasons I am not a fan of my job
12-06-2020T14:36:52,AspiringNoodle,"Since we hand-pick tickets at our store still, if him, or other customers like him come in, we're effectively chained to the counter until they're done"
12-06-2020T14:37:09,AspiringNoodle,We might be able to do 1 micro task at most between purchases
12-06-2020T14:57:36,Dakina,Yo
12-06-2020T14:57:48,SageSaga,yo
12-06-2020T15:01:43,AspiringNoodle,oy :D
12-06-2020T15:01:52,AspiringNoodle,wait...
12-06-2020T15:01:56,AspiringNoodle,D: oy
12-06-2020T15:02:07,AspiringNoodle,Das better~
12-06-2020T15:02:36,BadFoMo,0Y?
12-06-2020T15:03:16,AspiringNoodle,I don't know anymore
12-06-2020T15:03:31,BadFoMo,Same.
12-06-2020T15:03:36,AspiringNoodle,I'm just counting the days until I can get a flippin' haircut
12-06-2020T15:03:57,BadFoMo,Same again.
12-06-2020T15:04:16,AspiringNoodle,Over 3 months in now
12-06-2020T15:04:45,SageSaga,i usually go 5-6 months between haircuts...
12-06-2020T15:04:57,AspiringNoodle,Long hair?
12-06-2020T15:05:23,SageSaga,not really- it can be a bit once it gets to that time- i pretty much only get it cut when it gets in the way of drawing
12-06-2020T15:06:09,AspiringNoodle,"Well, as long as I'm still doing physical work, I'll keep it short"
12-06-2020T15:06:23,AspiringNoodle,Either that or see if my stylist can style it in such a way that it's not an issue
12-06-2020T15:06:32,SageSaga,if ya buzz it you can do that yourself! :D
12-06-2020T15:06:33,FoxxTrotter,The price is still going to be the same either way. ;0P
12-06-2020T15:06:54,AspiringNoodle,"As it stands, my hair is growing out from a style that's meant to be short, as in I got a cut once every 4 weeks"
12-06-2020T15:07:11,AspiringNoodle,So it's getting annoying and pokey in a lot of places
12-06-2020T15:10:10,AspiringNoodle,Hopefully I could get a style that could go 3+ months without a trim and it wouldn't be that big of a deal
12-06-2020T15:10:43,SageSaga,man i cant find my square brushes-
12-06-2020T15:19:28,SageSaga,brb- its really hot and i dont know why-
12-06-2020T15:22:15,AspiringNoodle,Time for haircut? :3
12-06-2020T15:24:35,SageSaga,my ac unit just isnt cooling like it used to
12-06-2020T15:27:49,AspiringNoodle,Don't do what my parents did
12-06-2020T15:28:24,AspiringNoodle,"The unit was older than I was, and we went through years of summers where the thing couldn't keep up and the house could get up into the low 80's before we finally replaced it"
12-06-2020T15:28:58,SageSaga,this unit is a year old
12-06-2020T15:32:18,Hogan,Eveninges! :-)
12-06-2020T15:32:28,SageSaga,yo
12-06-2020T15:33:01,Hogan,Looks like I luck out with an early start on the stream :-)
12-06-2020T15:33:26,SageSaga,is it still early?
12-06-2020T15:33:28,AspiringNoodle,"Oof, it need some work then"
12-06-2020T15:34:16,Hogan,"I think you usually start around 3 AM my time... right now its ""only"" 10.30 PM :-)"
12-06-2020T15:34:48,Hogan,So I only get to join when you are this early all considered :D
12-06-2020T15:35:08,SageSaga,then i normally start at 9PM on Saturday for you for the Saturday stream-
12-06-2020T15:35:35,SageSaga,my time i do a stream at 9pm on Friday and a stream at 3pm on Saturday
12-06-2020T15:36:27,Hogan,Excellent! I Then I might be able to catch more streams :-)
12-06-2020T15:36:54,Hogan,I'm late on today since I was out catching a anniversary showing of Empire Strikes back... :-)
12-06-2020T15:37:14,SageSaga,oh? at a Theater or?
12-06-2020T15:37:44,Hogan,"Yeah, they were doing a special showing of it only for today"
12-06-2020T15:38:03,SageSaga,what version?
12-06-2020T15:38:14,Hogan,"Limited access, especially since they had to leave half the seats empty due to social distancing"
12-06-2020T15:38:28,Hogan,The remasted
12-06-2020T15:38:57,Hogan,Not too bad since they didn't change much in ESB for that
12-06-2020T15:39:00,SageSaga,the remaster is good- i dont think Empire's special edition had that much extra
12-06-2020T15:39:33,SageSaga,they fixed the transparent speeder in the Hoth Battle XD
12-06-2020T15:39:50,Hogan,Most of the remastered stuff were in Cloud City IIRC
12-06-2020T15:40:12,Hogan,"Yep, and made the walls transperant in Cloud City XD"
12-06-2020T15:40:47,Hogan,I think this is still probably the best of the movies in the 3 trilogies
12-06-2020T15:41:50,Hogan,"They didn't need to add much to it in the remastering, just fixing a few details :-)"
12-06-2020T15:42:19,SageSaga,also just restoring the film- because it was degrading
12-06-2020T15:44:42,Ordithus,:csagesaga-nynasmirk: hello

12-06-2020T15:51:17,Hogan,"Heh, I liked AI when I started reading it, but after I actually started playing a MMORPG I got so much more of it XD"
12-06-2020T15:53:03,AspiringNoodle,*before leaving home*
12-06-2020T15:53:08,AspiringNoodle,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOB

12-06-2020T15:53:26,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, I go now c:"
12-06-2020T15:54:17,SageSaga,i am concerned for that boy
12-06-2020T15:56:46,Ordithus,he needs a month at a beach
12-06-2020T15:56:50,Hogan,Its been worse than this?
12-06-2020T15:57:50,SageSaga,what do ya mean Hogan?
12-06-2020T15:58:41,Hogan,Just wondering if there's been more to concerned about previously in addition to what I've could read from the chat?
12-06-2020T15:59:11,SageSaga,yes - sorta- it was mostly a joke but I suppose their is some truth to it XD
12-06-2020T16:00:59,Hogan,Been soffering from cabin fever during lockdown perhaps? :D
12-06-2020T16:01:45,SageSaga,perhaps
12-06-2020T16:02:33,Hogan,Unfortunately a common ailment these days :-|
12-06-2020T16:06:19,SageSaga,wth
12-06-2020T16:06:26,Ordithus,woah
12-06-2020T16:06:48,SageSaga,y'all saw that right?
12-06-2020T16:07:04,Ordithus,yep
12-06-2020T16:07:20,SageSaga,that was weird
12-06-2020T16:07:26,Hogan,"Sorry, looked away...?"
12-06-2020T16:08:08,SageSaga,i finished the stroke after coloring in one of the eyes- and then when i went to move the canvas it continued the line like it was still drawing - even though the pen was off the tablet
12-06-2020T16:08:31,SageSaga,and i figured i would just undo the random line- but the whole stroke got removed-
12-06-2020T16:08:51,Ordithus,didn't register that you had removed the pen
12-06-2020T16:09:13,SageSaga,ive never seen that happen before
12-06-2020T16:09:18,Ordithus,could have been a hiccup with the driver or something
12-06-2020T16:09:23,Hogan,"Okay, that sounds strange..."
12-06-2020T16:12:52,SageSaga,Henry has pretty eyes
12-06-2020T16:13:28,Ordithus,"they all do, wth"
