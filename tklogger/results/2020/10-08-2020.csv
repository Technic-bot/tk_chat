10-08-2020T00:10:25,SpazztasticKiwi,is this on purpose
10-08-2020T00:17:59,AspiringNoodle,r/MILDLYINFURIATING
10-08-2020T00:20:50,Dadrobit,"Offsetting a racing stripe can be 100% on purpose. This? This is the result of getting your body work done by a guy who knows a guy who's waaaay cheaper than those ""so called professionals""."
10-08-2020T00:25:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry about it, it‚Äôll be a statement‚Äù"
10-08-2020T00:27:54,SpazztasticKiwi,but why would someone offset a stripe on purpose
10-08-2020T00:29:07,AspiringNoodle,"If it was further off to the left, it would look like a purposeful statement"
10-08-2020T00:29:08,Dadrobit,"Usually it's 1/4 offset, so it bisects the halfway point. It can look good."
10-08-2020T00:29:24,AspiringNoodle,"Or half of dual racing stripes, but only do 1"
10-08-2020T00:29:25,SpazztasticKiwi,you lost me
10-08-2020T00:29:55,AspiringNoodle,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61V0QkZndtL._AC_SX466_.jpg
10-08-2020T00:30:09,AspiringNoodle,THAT is a purposeful offset (with a tasteful small strip)
10-08-2020T00:30:18,AspiringNoodle,What you linked was somebody having no idea what the eff they're doing

10-08-2020T00:32:12,Dadrobit,"Yup, what noodle posted as well. It can be done tastefully... As tasteful as a racing stripe can be...."
10-08-2020T00:32:17,SpazztasticKiwi,it looks like someone forgot to fill in the rest of the barcode
10-08-2020T00:33:23,AspiringNoodle,I take a bit of Japan's philosophy with racing stripes
10-08-2020T00:33:33,AspiringNoodle,It is sometimes an object's imperfection that makes it more attractive
10-08-2020T00:33:37,SpazztasticKiwi,but  w h y
10-08-2020T00:34:52,SpazztasticKiwi,another design conundrum
10-08-2020T00:35:09,SpazztasticKiwi,https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/742615527633190942/image0.jpg
10-08-2020T00:35:31,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-unimpressed:
10-08-2020T00:35:47,AspiringNoodle,"That would be me talking to the manager asking, ""Who in the hell designed this restroom?"""
10-08-2020T00:36:01,AspiringNoodle,"""No, I'm serious, I want to know so I can slap the guy who did this into next week."""
10-08-2020T00:36:03,Dadrobit,I'll take the one on the right
10-08-2020T00:36:46,Dadrobit,"Also, spazz. What's so hard to understand about racing stripes? They make your car go even faster than if you painted flames on it!"
10-08-2020T00:37:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs on purpose, accident, or ‚Äúyou know what‚Äôll really piss someone off..?‚Äù"
10-08-2020T00:37:22,SpazztasticKiwi,aren‚Äôt the flames supposed to make it look hotter
10-08-2020T00:38:16,Dadrobit,Flames are multipurpose. Speed and heat. But their lack of specialization means they're not quite the best at both.
10-08-2020T00:39:12,Dadrobit,And maximum heat requires actual flames from your exhaust system.
10-08-2020T00:40:21,SpazztasticKiwi,stripes = more zoomies
10-08-2020T00:40:45,SpazztasticKiwi,flames = hot + zoomies
10-08-2020T00:41:01,SpazztasticKiwi,so stripes are ‚Äúcool‚Äù zoomies
10-08-2020T00:41:13,SpazztasticKiwi,sophisticated zoomies
10-08-2020T00:41:25,Dadrobit,It's quite a sophisticated scene.
10-08-2020T00:41:43,SpazztasticKiwi,need me a second monocle
10-08-2020T00:42:20,Dadrobit,"Ahhh, going for the Bionicle look."
10-08-2020T00:44:41,SpazztasticKiwi,more determining if I have the oomph to watch a movie or just go on
10-08-2020T00:45:45,Dadrobit,Movie come later for me. Probably start something in 3 or 4 hours.
10-08-2020T00:46:13,Dadrobit,Watched Kiki last time.
10-08-2020T00:46:31,Dadrobit,"It was pretty okay, very much more for kids."
10-08-2020T00:47:19,Dadrobit,Probably do Nausicca or Spirited Away next.
10-08-2020T00:53:46,AspiringNoodle,Spirited Awaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay

10-08-2020T02:10:11,Dadrobit,Enjoy the movie
10-08-2020T02:10:25,Dadrobit,Movie is delayed here.
10-08-2020T02:10:39,Dadrobit,Minor emergency at work wants my attention.

10-08-2020T03:38:35,JojoGD,Wow it‚Äôs been a year since I first read Twokinds. Time went by so fast
10-08-2020T03:39:55,TerraTheWizard,time be like that
10-08-2020T03:47:20,SpazztasticKiwi,boar was not good
10-08-2020T03:47:31,SpazztasticKiwi,not exactly worth the time
10-08-2020T03:55:29,CrRAR,Boar?
10-08-2020T03:55:49,CrRAR,"What elder god are you trying to summon at this hour, spazz?"
10-08-2020T03:55:53,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-power:
10-08-2020T03:58:46,Dadrobit,"Hmmm, RAR, I dunno how to tell you this, but boar is a type of wild pig. Not an elder God..."
10-08-2020T03:59:22,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs apparently a big fkn pig
10-08-2020T03:59:30,SpazztasticKiwi,literally all it is
10-08-2020T03:59:44,Dadrobit,Big ol tusked pig
10-08-2020T03:59:45,SpazztasticKiwi,and it attacksa few people
10-08-2020T04:00:15,Dadrobit,Also very hairy.
10-08-2020T04:00:23,SpazztasticKiwi,nobody thinks to call the cops - even if the first old man was wrote off & ignored
10-08-2020T04:01:07,Dadrobit,"Yeah, wild pigs are not to be fucked with. Javelinas fucked up a night guard behind my gate a while back pretty bad."
10-08-2020T04:01:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"anything tearing up fences & animals, whatever it is, even if it‚Äôs a regular wild boar, will get investigated"
10-08-2020T04:02:33,SpazztasticKiwi,it starts to become a danger doing all that so close to people butthats just glossed over
10-08-2020T04:03:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"and big boar or not, you can‚Äôt tell me a good rifle or shotgun to the head ain‚Äôt killing it"
10-08-2020T04:03:39,Dadrobit,So did you get some off a local Hunter or something?
10-08-2020T04:04:06,SpazztasticKiwi,get what
10-08-2020T04:04:27,Dadrobit,"Ehhh, their skills are pretty fuckin stout, so it likely wants to at least be of a certain caliber."
10-08-2020T04:04:33,Dadrobit,Skulls*
10-08-2020T04:04:47,Dadrobit,Some of the boar? You said you didn't like it.
10-08-2020T04:05:28,SpazztasticKiwi,the thing was big as a generic 4 wheel vehicle
10-08-2020T04:05:52,Dadrobit,Like a Honda Civic?
10-08-2020T04:06:04,Dadrobit,"That's no boar, that's a rhino."
10-08-2020T04:06:29,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe that means more skull to get through but either they were poor shots - which it was a horror movie so most of them were
10-08-2020T04:06:49,Dadrobit,Oh. I thought you ate some boar and didn't like it.
10-08-2020T04:07:13,SpazztasticKiwi,or the thing was meant to be supernatural rather than a mega pig
10-08-2020T04:07:36,SpazztasticKiwi,nah - horror movie
10-08-2020T04:07:45,Dadrobit,Gotcha
10-08-2020T04:09:19,SpazztasticKiwi,mother of all boars tearing up fences and eating farm animals but nobody sees it & of course no one believes the old man that says he spotted it
10-08-2020T04:10:06,CrRAR,In the old days they just blamed the chupathingy
10-08-2020T04:10:43,SpazztasticKiwi,there‚Äôs of course a missing couple whose car was found without them anywhere near & everyone finally starts adding 1 + 1 as more people get eaten disappear or come across it
10-08-2020T04:10:47,Dadrobit,Chupacabra
10-08-2020T04:11:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"but for Christ‚Äôs sake, you‚Äôre telling me none of these people -mind you, this is in an area where there‚Äôs mostly farm land & boar hunting so people got some nasty guns"
10-08-2020T04:11:53,CrRAR,I just associate boars with the occult I guess.
10-08-2020T04:12:05,SpazztasticKiwi,- has a good enough bang or aim to kill it until the end?
10-08-2020T04:12:57,CrRAR,Boars do have that ‚Äòwow‚Äô factor
10-08-2020T04:13:20,CrRAR,Like when you seen one you surprised you even seen one at first
10-08-2020T04:13:33,CrRAR,Delays gun grabbin time
10-08-2020T04:14:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"especially at the end, the thing is downed because someone hits it with their truck & chicky can‚Äôt hit it five feet in front of her"
10-08-2020T04:14:23,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs head is wide as a car hood
10-08-2020T04:14:33,Dadrobit,https://imgur.com/a/SgnDUbA the boar in question
10-08-2020T04:14:37,SpazztasticKiwi,hOw CaN yOu MiSs
10-08-2020T04:15:06,CrRAR,Maybe somone greased the boar up
10-08-2020T04:15:11,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe that‚Äôs what they were going for in the movie
10-08-2020T04:15:14,Twokinds,:pig2:
10-08-2020T04:15:20,SpazztasticKiwi,hey Tom

10-08-2020T04:15:33,SpazztasticKiwi,let me see if I can get a picture from the movie
10-08-2020T04:15:54,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs got to be a puppet from how it moves
10-08-2020T04:16:13,SpazztasticKiwi,but that‚Äôs better than trashy cgi
10-08-2020T04:17:41,Dadrobit,"That reminds me, one of these days I need to watch Sharknado."
10-08-2020T04:18:38,CrRAR,Watching those is a test of the fortitudes

10-08-2020T04:20:37,CrRAR,"Wow, it‚Äôs pretty demented"
10-08-2020T04:20:47,Dadrobit,Very Princess Mononoke-esque.
10-08-2020T04:21:15,CrRAR,ikr
10-08-2020T04:21:23,Dadrobit,Also kinda reminds me of the wolf from The Neverending Story.
10-08-2020T04:21:41,SpazztasticKiwi,fear is a factor for sure with your aim but the things pretty forgiving for most of the movie when it‚Äôs being SHOT AT
10-08-2020T04:21:50,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI‚Äôll just stand here I guess‚Äù
10-08-2020T04:22:10,SpazztasticKiwi,and you‚Äôre telling me it doesn‚Äôt go down
10-08-2020T04:22:26,Dadrobit,"Well running with a gun is very dangerous, they were just being safe."
10-08-2020T04:23:12,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs not pitiful but not entirely  worth the time
10-08-2020T04:24:03,Dadrobit,Horror is rarely up my alley unless it's literally Tremors.
10-08-2020T04:24:41,SpazztasticKiwi,day scene - charging at two characters https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/742674680925782036/image0.jpg
10-08-2020T04:24:53,SpazztasticKiwi,this was in the movie
10-08-2020T04:25:04,Dadrobit,That's just comical
10-08-2020T04:25:51,Dadrobit,I also loved The Meg. It was like if a B-Movie team on Sci-Fi got a giant budget.
10-08-2020T04:26:08,SpazztasticKiwi,the meg was the new jaws
10-08-2020T04:26:28,SpazztasticKiwi,can‚Äôt tell me it wasn‚Äôt a secret refresher with a different name
10-08-2020T04:26:47,Dadrobit,"Nah, Jaws was loved by pretty much everyone. The Meg got absolutely panned."
10-08-2020T04:27:33,CrRAR,Maybe cuz it just fell into the whole megashark mess
10-08-2020T04:28:31,SpazztasticKiwi,47 meters down uncaged is good
10-08-2020T04:29:00,Dadrobit,I don't think so. I think it was legit just not cinematically great.
10-08-2020T04:29:08,Dadrobit,The Meg I mean.
10-08-2020T04:29:23,Dadrobit,But I loved it for what it was
10-08-2020T04:29:52,SpazztasticKiwi,black water abyss is realistic
10-08-2020T04:30:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"no mega croc, though it is pretty big"
10-08-2020T04:31:18,SpazztasticKiwi,the aggression might be hyped but trapped with a crocodile underground in a flooding cave without anyone knowing because you didn‚Äôt tell anyone where you‚Äôd be and when or anything
10-08-2020T04:31:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚Äúdon‚Äôt want anyone stealing your discovery‚Äù aiight, die then"
10-08-2020T04:32:54,SpazztasticKiwi,was it just me or were they constantly moving the size of the meg in the movie
10-08-2020T04:33:15,SpazztasticKiwi,that first one wasn‚Äôt the same size through the whole thing and it bugged me
10-08-2020T04:33:27,Dadrobit,"Iirc, there were multiple of them."
10-08-2020T04:33:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"there was the two yeah and the second was bigger but before they kill the first, it‚Äôs massive"
10-08-2020T04:33:53,Dadrobit,The first was a baby. Then the one after the baby was the giant adult.
10-08-2020T04:34:09,CrRAR,Swiss arm knife of sharks
10-08-2020T04:34:14,SpazztasticKiwi,bigger than their boats and significant size in comparison to the underwater lab

10-08-2020T04:36:54,Dadrobit,The closest I've come was watching a drill seargent make his troops March while singing it.
10-08-2020T04:38:12,Dadrobit,"Which was weird. It seemed most of the main cadence was off-beat, which is terrible for marching."
10-08-2020T04:38:16,SpazztasticKiwi,that has to be a sight for tourists
