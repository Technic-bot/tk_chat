24-12-2020T21:28:23,Grip,Poor fox
24-12-2020T21:29:20,SageSaga,Cain brought her back in a Chimera robot body because he was under the impression Chimeras would eventually be the ones on top

24-12-2020T21:31:50,ZRO4825,"I mean, it's not like they have cat instincts or anything (other than Blue being extremely flexible...Kate too I imagine, but hasn't shown it yet, lol)"
24-12-2020T21:32:23,Grip,Enjoying ear rubbing and also sensitive tail I have seen with them

24-12-2020T23:50:35,CrRAR,Maintained a kind of pretty good lvl of quality a while
24-12-2020T23:51:05,Dadrobit,We live in a society where Shrek sequels are a measuring tool.

24-12-2020T23:52:08,Dadrobit,Not a complaint by the by
24-12-2020T23:53:17,Dadrobit,The How To Train Your Dragon spin offs were pretty clear cashgrabs. But the actual sequels there were pretty fire as well.
24-12-2020T23:53:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"speaking of the faith in humanity, a woman forgot her baby at the airport"
24-12-2020T23:53:39,Ordithus,dreamworks can sequel is the conclusion i'm seeing
24-12-2020T23:53:56,CrRAR,That sounds like a plot to a 90s movie or something
24-12-2020T23:53:56,Dadrobit,"Pretty much, Ord lol!"
24-12-2020T23:54:20,CrRAR,like in a carriage spazz?

24-12-2020T23:58:01,Dadrobit,Very festive
24-12-2020T23:58:14,KeefMcDerpface,That's what I was thinking.
24-12-2020T23:58:26,SageSaga,you ever feel inconvenienced when someone gives you cash as a gift?
24-12-2020T23:58:37,CrRAR,Hmm
24-12-2020T23:58:55,CrRAR,now you gotta make decisions
24-12-2020T23:59:09,CrRAR,seems ok
24-12-2020T23:59:24,Dadrobit,I'm the opposite. I appreciate cash way more than something like a gift card.
24-12-2020T23:59:31,Ordithus,^
24-12-2020T23:59:34,KeefMcDerpface,^
24-12-2020T23:59:43,Ordithus,though I'd rather have a gift
24-12-2020T23:59:48,SageSaga,its more like- i dont use cash- i always use my cards- no i either gotta go out of my way to use cash- or- go alllll the way to the bank to deposit it
