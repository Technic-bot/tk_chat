31-05-2020T00:01:53,CrRAR,tru
31-05-2020T00:01:57,RimaDraws,i cant have milk ori get gassy
31-05-2020T00:02:10,SpazztasticKiwi,like young milk stacked up in a coat acting like adult milk
31-05-2020T00:02:18,Ordithus,"almond is good, coconut in some things.  I usually just get lactose free cow milk"
31-05-2020T00:02:29,RimaDraws,i love almond milk too
31-05-2020T00:02:29,Ordithus,better for cooking with
31-05-2020T00:02:33,SpazztasticKiwi,but the element hotel at PAX was a gift at breakfast
31-05-2020T00:04:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"they had over 4 kinds of milk with your choice of cereals, yogurts with multiple berries & nuts, waffle and pancake makers (& fixings), juices, plus a grill bar where a cook would make you eggs and toast"
31-05-2020T00:04:13,SpazztasticKiwi,and bagels
31-05-2020T00:04:20,SpazztasticKiwi,there were also bagels
31-05-2020T00:05:13,SpazztasticKiwi,loved that hotel
31-05-2020T00:05:43,SpazztasticKiwi,strawberries made it taste sour last time
31-05-2020T00:06:20,SpazztasticKiwi,banana milk smooth üçå ü•õ
31-05-2020T00:12:50,SpazztasticKiwi,this is a stupid question but a 4.75 object will fit in a 5x5x5 box right (with little amount of space for padding)
31-05-2020T00:13:14,SpazztasticKiwi,~4.72‚Äù~
31-05-2020T00:13:45,Ordithus,5 > 4.72
31-05-2020T00:13:59,Ordithus,not by a lot tho
31-05-2020T00:19:08,AspiringNoodle,Howdily doodily lurkerinos :D
31-05-2020T00:19:31,Twokinds,:eyes:
31-05-2020T00:19:35,AspiringNoodle,"Man, Youtube's algorithm is scary good... I got recommended a 4 year old video by CinemaSins"

31-05-2020T00:20:03,AspiringNoodle,*puts out well-done steak for the lurking Tom*
31-05-2020T00:20:28,Ordithus,don't forget the knockoff spaghetti-os
31-05-2020T00:20:32,AspiringNoodle,So apparently CS did a video on Oculus.  I'm loving it so far.  And it's amazing how much his presentation upped its game since then
31-05-2020T00:20:45,AspiringNoodle,Also canned stew and was it ketchup or A1? lol
31-05-2020T00:20:52,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-reniderp:
31-05-2020T00:21:01,AspiringNoodle,I'll just go with generic ketchup since it's cheaper~
31-05-2020T00:21:07,Ordithus,and then you make something that belongs in a restaurant
31-05-2020T00:21:19,Ordithus,I get this
31-05-2020T00:21:21,Twokinds,I had canned stew today.
31-05-2020T00:21:25,AspiringNoodle,:D
31-05-2020T00:24:30,AspiringNoodle,Any of you ever watch Oculus?
31-05-2020T00:25:20,JojoGD,Downtown San Diego is a mess right now
31-05-2020T00:30:21,AspiringNoodle,"Jojo, you into horror?"
31-05-2020T00:31:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn‚Äôt figure
31-05-2020T00:31:40,JojoGD,Nope
31-05-2020T00:32:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I found an ~adorable~ snowglobe for my friends anniversary
31-05-2020T00:32:12,JojoGD,Nice
31-05-2020T00:32:13,AspiringNoodle,pics?
31-05-2020T00:32:16,SpazztasticKiwi,but I want a box I can pack it in to wrap
31-05-2020T00:32:58,SpazztasticKiwi,gift box is 5x5x5 & globe is 4.72 diameter wise but no height measurement
31-05-2020T00:33:03,Ordithus,give snowglobe lots of padding
31-05-2020T00:33:13,SpazztasticKiwi,meaning little padding room
31-05-2020T00:33:22,SpazztasticKiwi,which makes me nervous
31-05-2020T00:33:26,Ordithus,little box in bigger box?

31-05-2020T00:34:22,SpazztasticKiwi,personalizable message
31-05-2020T00:34:32,Ordithus,nice
31-05-2020T00:34:38,AspiringNoodle,Extra excellent!
31-05-2020T00:34:56,SpazztasticKiwi,which card to get is another debate
31-05-2020T00:35:07,Ordithus,"""congrats at being stuck to each other for another year"""
31-05-2020T00:35:21,Ordithus,"stuff lil box with crumpled newspaper or something like that, bigger box filled with bubblewrap"
31-05-2020T00:35:31,SpazztasticKiwi,but protecting the breakable is priority
31-05-2020T00:35:54,AspiringNoodle,"""Congrats on tolerating each other for one full year!  That's gotta be some kind of record or something."""
31-05-2020T00:36:05,JojoGD,Congrats
31-05-2020T00:36:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚ÄúI‚Äôll shrink it to the size a flea....then I‚Äôll put it in a box, then I‚Äôll put that box inside of another box....‚Äù"
31-05-2020T00:37:27,SpazztasticKiwi,might find a really big box and stuff it with newspaper in between gradually smaller boxes
31-05-2020T00:37:44,SpazztasticKiwi,that ought to do it
31-05-2020T00:38:07,Ordithus,anyways
31-05-2020T00:38:12,Ordithus,:ptv-sleepy:

31-05-2020T00:39:40,SpazztasticKiwi,but I have design decision I need votes for
31-05-2020T00:39:45,SpazztasticKiwi,y u leave
31-05-2020T00:40:41,SpazztasticKiwi,there‚Äôs the question which card to pair it with & how I want to order the engraving lines
31-05-2020T00:41:23,SpazztasticKiwi,sure this anniversary isn‚Äôt until September but what‚Äôs it gonna hurt to get ahead
31-05-2020T00:56:47,SpazztasticKiwi,they survived quarantine...freshly married....their first year
31-05-2020T01:38:46,DarthRexKing,Good to know. Bye everyone. \o
31-05-2020T01:50:14,SpazztasticKiwi,ü¶â
31-05-2020T01:57:58,AspiringNoodle,Just watched a fun video about next gen consoles
31-05-2020T01:58:19,AspiringNoodle,"My 2 cents?  Speaking from experience, it's easier to hit something at half the resolution than it is half the fps, lol"
31-05-2020T01:58:54,AspiringNoodle,And this experience is less than a year old!
31-05-2020T02:00:20,Dadrobit,"Missed the stream today, feelsbadman."
31-05-2020T02:00:35,Dadrobit,"Watching the vod and holy shitballs, that lo-fi Kat tho!"
31-05-2020T02:02:56,SpazztasticKiwi,hitting it hard with staying up so late
31-05-2020T02:02:58,AspiringNoodle,Best pic of the decade so far :D
31-05-2020T02:03:04,SpazztasticKiwi,he‚Äôs getting stuffs done
31-05-2020T02:03:09,AspiringNoodle,"You see the stream chat, everyone went nuts"
31-05-2020T02:03:21,AspiringNoodle,I'm making it my background @w@
31-05-2020T02:03:37,Dadrobit,"For real though, Tom. If you're here, that legitimately might be the best thing you've ever done with the Patreon."
31-05-2020T02:04:01,AspiringNoodle,Never thought I'd get rid of this illustration of Zootopia from afar
31-05-2020T02:04:15,AspiringNoodle,"It's just so good, and then Tom comes along, being all artsy and junk"
31-05-2020T02:23:30,Twokinds,Thanks ^^ Means a lot
31-05-2020T02:25:38,Roughlandin,"Means a lot to all of us. Keep up the great work, Tom. Night!"
31-05-2020T02:43:11,Dadrobit,It really shows that you put in some ridiculous effort with the day night cycle. I really appreciate that even after years of doing this stuff you still can throw out that kind of effort.
31-05-2020T02:44:28,Dadrobit,"Once the Nora Cards are back up, I definitely need to snag one. Throw a bit of an extra thanks ya know?"
31-05-2020T02:49:46,Twokinds,":ctwokinds-daydreamingkat: I like to do it, when I can. Time's always the biggest factor with everything, but I try! ^^'"
31-05-2020T02:49:54,Twokinds,Thanks
31-05-2020T02:50:25,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I get that for sure."
31-05-2020T02:51:36,Dadrobit,"I s'pose that's the benefit of NC's being down for the time being. If you'd had extra commissions on top of this, lo-fi Kat probably wouldn't have gotten the same attention it got here."
31-05-2020T02:52:56,iliar,"Lo-Fi Kat turned out very well. At the vote, I was not very interested in this sketch. But the result is many times better than I expected."
31-05-2020T03:02:23,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs not even more effort these days
31-05-2020T03:02:54,SpazztasticKiwi,times meant the good stuff takes shorter shifts to make
31-05-2020T03:03:52,SpazztasticKiwi,itty bitty zoom in details get done that aren‚Äôt seen unless you see the stream
31-05-2020T03:05:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I used to draw more
31-05-2020T03:05:54,SpazztasticKiwi,got reasonably fast at lines and tiny things
31-05-2020T03:06:06,SpazztasticKiwi,can‚Äôt do what I used to
31-05-2020T03:07:01,SpazztasticKiwi,time at it means he‚Äôs got unconscious muscle memory for the good stuff - he just adds to it now
31-05-2020T03:11:39,SpazztasticKiwi,alrighty so who else got a bed time coming up
31-05-2020T03:32:29,Dadrobit,In a few hours. Tomorrow's gonna suck. Gotta wake up early-ish for a doctor's appointment. Doc says he's doing a battery of tests that'll itself take several hours. Then I still have to work overnight afterwards.
31-05-2020T03:32:33,Dadrobit,Gonna be long day.
31-05-2020T03:33:40,SpazztasticKiwi,check up or are you dying
31-05-2020T03:34:32,Dadrobit,yes
31-05-2020T03:34:57,SpazztasticKiwi,don‚Äôt they wait till your 60s to do body scans for men
31-05-2020T03:35:10,Dadrobit,???
31-05-2020T03:36:20,Dadrobit,Like.... Are you talking prostate exam? That starts at like 40.
31-05-2020T03:36:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"you know, once you hit 60 or somethin they order a colonoscopy, physical, blood work, certain other exams, and basically do a body check"
31-05-2020T03:36:45,SpazztasticKiwi,information I wasn‚Äôt searching for
31-05-2020T03:36:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"but yes, basically"
31-05-2020T03:37:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"normally I hear you go in, doc be like ‚Äúyou feel funny?‚Äù"
31-05-2020T03:37:17,Dadrobit,"Nah, this is just because my lungs still aren't recovered."
31-05-2020T03:37:17,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúnah‚Äù
31-05-2020T03:37:27,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúsee you in 6 months then‚Äù
31-05-2020T03:37:38,Dadrobit,"""Look to the left and cough"""
31-05-2020T03:37:45,Dadrobit,"""Yes ma'am."""
31-05-2020T03:38:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I know how the dance is done - don‚Äôt need a visual
31-05-2020T03:38:17,SpazztasticKiwi,they think theres organ damage?
31-05-2020T03:38:32,Dadrobit,"I mean, partially it's kinda a guarantee."
31-05-2020T03:38:55,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe it just gave you asthma
31-05-2020T03:39:10,Dadrobit,Asthma was a per-existing condition.
31-05-2020T03:39:28,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe it just reawakened it for a bit then
31-05-2020T03:39:55,Dadrobit,Viruses live and multiply by literally melting/exploding cells. This shit actually melted my lungs on the cellular level. Shit sucks.
31-05-2020T03:40:13,Dadrobit,Asthma was alive and well even before I got sick.
31-05-2020T03:40:38,SpazztasticKiwi,think it‚Äôll effect you trying to work out again
31-05-2020T03:40:52,Dadrobit,Yes. Can confirm.
31-05-2020T03:41:12,SpazztasticKiwi,cut your job capacity?
31-05-2020T03:41:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"like, might have to retire early?"
31-05-2020T03:41:26,Dadrobit,I can't even ride my stationary bike for any amount of time anymore.
31-05-2020T03:41:50,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe they‚Äôll try some asthma therapy
31-05-2020T03:41:57,Dadrobit,Security? Nah. Even like this I'm in better shape than some of my associates....
31-05-2020T03:42:08,SpazztasticKiwi,that....
31-05-2020T03:42:18,SpazztasticKiwi,where is this
31-05-2020T03:42:23,SpazztasticKiwi,that‚Äôs not comforting
31-05-2020T03:42:29,Dadrobit,Very wealthy neighborhood.
31-05-2020T03:43:13,Dadrobit,Most of us are in great shape. But there are a few very old men working with us that I'm not sure could survive a power-walk for 10 minutes.
31-05-2020T03:43:14,SpazztasticKiwi,to know the security isn‚Äôt particularly in shape
31-05-2020T03:44:10,SpazztasticKiwi,if all you got is really big cats to shoo and kids to wave a stick at..
31-05-2020T03:44:19,SpazztasticKiwi,can‚Äôt matter too much
31-05-2020T03:44:22,Dadrobit,One of the requirements for working my post is you have to look like you're in great shape. But there are a few older men that predate that ruling.
31-05-2020T03:44:52,SpazztasticKiwi,is that safe for them tho
31-05-2020T03:44:59,Dadrobit,shrugs
31-05-2020T03:45:26,SpazztasticKiwi,and what kind acts as looking in shape
31-05-2020T03:45:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"like, they got a cardboard cut out you gotta walk through and if you fit, you‚Äôre in?"
31-05-2020T03:45:59,SpazztasticKiwi,cause they can‚Äôt go by weight
31-05-2020T03:46:00,Dadrobit,"95% of the clients don't actually want good security, they want a concierge with a badge to greet them at the gate."
31-05-2020T03:46:17,SpazztasticKiwi,a dog says hello at your door too
31-05-2020T03:46:45,SpazztasticKiwi,intruder deterrent too
31-05-2020T03:47:11,Dadrobit,"Really it just means no beer bellies. You don't have to be buff, you just have to be on the slender side."
31-05-2020T03:47:50,Dadrobit,"If you have to ask for a larger shirt size, then they'll ask you to find a new diet, or a new job."
31-05-2020T03:48:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚Äúif the shirt screams when you put it on, cut the beer‚Äù"
31-05-2020T03:48:52,Dadrobit,"We do have one guy on the big side, but he's a supervisor soooo."
31-05-2020T03:49:03,SpazztasticKiwi,yeaaaah that fits
31-05-2020T03:49:06,SpazztasticKiwi,ü•Å
31-05-2020T03:49:54,Dadrobit,"I don't agree with his free pass personally, but again, he's one of the ones that's been around forever, longer than even me."
31-05-2020T03:50:26,SpazztasticKiwi,any ladies allowed?
31-05-2020T03:50:53,Dadrobit,"Yeah, we have two or three."
31-05-2020T03:51:28,Dadrobit,No gender discrimination at this particular post. It's just that there aren't many women in security period.
31-05-2020T03:52:46,SpazztasticKiwi,because it‚Äôs easier to put a guy blocking the door than someone that could theoretically be half his size
31-05-2020T03:53:11,SpazztasticKiwi,can‚Äôt see myself doing security unless it was only watching cameras
31-05-2020T03:53:24,Dadrobit,And I know that the security company my post hired DEFINITELY does not turn down women. Watched one lady fail the AZDPS test for the third time at HQ. Her latest failure was her worst showing. And the managers were discussing how maybe they could still
31-05-2020T03:53:36,Dadrobit,figure out how to finagle her in.
31-05-2020T03:54:00,Dadrobit,"""Maybe if we took the right answers from all of her attempts and added them up?"""
31-05-2020T03:54:07,SpazztasticKiwi,think she was related to an upper or somethin?
31-05-2020T03:54:17,Dadrobit,No clue.
31-05-2020T03:54:20,SpazztasticKiwi,or was she just hot
31-05-2020T03:54:26,Dadrobit,Definitely not that.
31-05-2020T03:54:34,Dadrobit,"No offense to her, but she just wasn't."
31-05-2020T03:54:49,Dadrobit,And the test.... I don't know how you fail it the first time....
31-05-2020T03:55:13,SpazztasticKiwi,may be trying to put more women in so they don‚Äôt look like they‚Äôre excluding
31-05-2020T03:55:36,Dadrobit,"It's just common sense stuff. Basically just saying ""I have no additional rights afforded to me because I am a security officer. I am just a regular civilian in a fancy shirt."""
31-05-2020T03:57:18,Dadrobit,"""What do you do in this situation?"" ""Call the cops"" ""What about THIS situation?"" ""Call the cops."" ""What about THIS situation?"" ""Run away. Then call the cops."""
31-05-2020T03:57:54,SpazztasticKiwi,think they were desperate being shorthanded
31-05-2020T03:58:02,Dadrobit,Security always is.
31-05-2020T03:58:16,Dadrobit,1/3 to 1/2 don't survive training.
31-05-2020T03:58:29,Dadrobit,Half of what's left doesn't survive a month.
31-05-2020T03:58:38,SpazztasticKiwi,there‚Äôs actually training when you have to only look fit
31-05-2020T03:58:39,Dadrobit,Half of the remainder doesn't last a quarter.
31-05-2020T03:59:08,Dadrobit,Training as in how to talk to your clients and operate an ipad.
31-05-2020T03:59:25,SpazztasticKiwi,customer service and modern technology
31-05-2020T03:59:27,Dadrobit,Sometimes you have to write reports.
31-05-2020T03:59:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I know how to apple product
31-05-2020T04:00:45,SpazztasticKiwi,wait if you‚Äôre at the gate for a gated community how are the extra large housecats getting in
31-05-2020T04:00:46,Dadrobit,I think most trainees are surprised at the construction contractors and how they try to get in without paying. They get very confrontational when you stop them and tell them there's an entry fee. Not everyone can stand their ground.
31-05-2020T04:01:19,Dadrobit,The gate/walls only face the road. The community is built into a mountain canyon.
31-05-2020T04:01:32,Dadrobit,Everything behind us is protected land.
31-05-2020T04:01:56,SpazztasticKiwi,they didn‚Äôt even consider getting a fence there?
31-05-2020T04:02:28,Dadrobit,The open desert aesthetic is what my clients are paying 10 million dollars and more for in the first place.
31-05-2020T04:02:50,SpazztasticKiwi,this is why we have horror movies
31-05-2020T04:03:05,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúwhat‚Äôs that way over that gorgeous view?‚Äù
31-05-2020T04:03:09,Dadrobit,"Like I said, most of em don't want real security."
31-05-2020T04:03:14,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúwild animals‚Äù
31-05-2020T04:03:33,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want a single barrier between us‚Äù
31-05-2020T04:03:37,Dadrobit,The ones that do build their own gates or moats and have their own security on top of us.
31-05-2020T04:04:46,SpazztasticKiwi,how do they not see this going badly eventually
31-05-2020T04:05:32,Dadrobit,Probably one of my favorite clients has one of the most badass homes. It's a legitimate castle and the moat bridge comes up to reveal his hidden underground car garage for his collection.
31-05-2020T04:05:50,SpazztasticKiwi,if it‚Äôs not a kid or idiot venturing out too far or something with very sharp teeth sneaking in
31-05-2020T04:06:13,Dadrobit,Hence the curfew.
31-05-2020T04:06:32,SpazztasticKiwi,but do they always follow it tho
31-05-2020T04:06:37,SpazztasticKiwi,what about the possibility of a case of rabies
31-05-2020T04:07:05,SpazztasticKiwi,nothing short of a quick gun stops that
31-05-2020T04:08:36,Dadrobit,"Nope, they don't follow it. But at the expense of sounding like an asshole. It's really not my problem."
31-05-2020T04:10:06,SpazztasticKiwi,not wrong but who are they gonna blame if something does go wrong
31-05-2020T04:10:28,Dadrobit,Nobody.
31-05-2020T04:10:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean it‚Äôs obviously not like you‚Äôre seeing lions tigers and bears multiple times a day in groups
31-05-2020T04:11:46,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe what they gots good enough for the usual pace
31-05-2020T04:11:47,Dadrobit,It's part of the contract when you agree to live there. The appeal of the location is the natural flora and fauna. And the HOA puts it in the contract that shit happens sometimes.
31-05-2020T04:12:20,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúwe‚Äôre not liable if you‚Äôre an idiot or nature be natural and is unpredictable‚Äù?
31-05-2020T04:12:44,Dadrobit,Happened a few years back when one of the residents was found half eaten in the canyon a day after he disappeared. No one's fault but his own.
31-05-2020T04:13:12,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah
31-05-2020T04:13:36,SpazztasticKiwi,stuff you gotta keep in mind when things happened
31-05-2020T04:13:40,Dadrobit,This isn't untreaded territory. It's a legitimate thing that has happened and is laid out for every prospective resident by the HOA as a possibility.
31-05-2020T04:14:28,SpazztasticKiwi,my dad dying was partially his own doing regardless of the medical half that did him in
31-05-2020T04:18:09,SpazztasticKiwi,& there is a thing as lung regeneration therapy
31-05-2020T04:19:16,SpazztasticKiwi,so you can get tissue and function back
31-05-2020T04:19:23,SpazztasticKiwi,could
31-05-2020T04:21:18,Dadrobit,"I mean, I am getting better. It's just really slow. Today was the first time I felt comfortable doing narration again at all, but at least that means progress is happening."
31-05-2020T04:24:37,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah - breathing exercises and regular use besides sitting there existing makes the lungs work out the kinks
31-05-2020T04:25:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"oxygen is needed for anything to happen so the more you flex the ol air sacks, the more they‚Äôre forced to replace what‚Äôs gone"
31-05-2020T04:26:51,SpazztasticKiwi,didn‚Äôt you say you were due to go to bed
31-05-2020T04:28:25,Dadrobit,In a few hours. About 3 1/2 from now.
31-05-2020T04:28:38,Dadrobit,Was booting up some Monster Hunter just now to pass the time.

31-05-2020T04:31:25,AspiringNoodle,Nice to meet you Kiwi.  Noodle's my name.  Insomnia's my game :D
31-05-2020T04:31:27,Dadrobit,No. I usually work until 5:15 am
31-05-2020T04:31:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I got work at 4 but it‚Äôs 4 now so I‚Äôm aiight
31-05-2020T04:31:56,Dadrobit,"Get home around 6, dick about for an hour or three with Oreo. Then bed."
31-05-2020T04:32:29,Dadrobit,"Today I'm going to bed at 6 though, so I can wake up at 2 for the doctor and be fully rested."
31-05-2020T04:32:32,SpazztasticKiwi,how does one dick about with oreo for an hour or three
31-05-2020T04:32:44,SpazztasticKiwi,parks are closed & you‚Äôre lungs are evidently shot
31-05-2020T04:32:52,Dadrobit,Fetch mostly.
31-05-2020T04:33:12,Dadrobit,Some tug of war for a bit.
31-05-2020T04:33:23,Dadrobit,Plenty of snuggles.
31-05-2020T04:33:33,AspiringNoodle,And lots of belly wubs? :ptv-excited:
31-05-2020T04:33:36,SpazztasticKiwi,dogs - what‚Äôs chasing after the same ball for the 2 billionth time compared to the first?
31-05-2020T04:33:52,AspiringNoodle,"Kiwi, did you see Up? lol"
31-05-2020T04:34:04,Dadrobit,He doesn't like his balls as much as he likes his logs.
31-05-2020T04:34:04,AspiringNoodle,Pretty much sums up dogs in a nutshell :P
31-05-2020T04:34:23,Dadrobit,He has one fetch log that he fukkin loves.
31-05-2020T04:34:28,SpazztasticKiwi,that movies been out for 11 years

31-05-2020T04:36:36,SpazztasticKiwi,is he different colored now
31-05-2020T04:36:42,Dadrobit,No?
31-05-2020T04:36:47,AspiringNoodle,"""I F#@%ING LOVE THIS STICK"" :ptv-excited:"
31-05-2020T04:37:01,AspiringNoodle,But why he look so sad in pic? :c
31-05-2020T04:37:02,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs brown

31-05-2020T04:37:23,AspiringNoodle,I think that might be the yellow lighting
31-05-2020T04:37:38,AspiringNoodle,"Yup, yellow lighting"
31-05-2020T04:37:48,Dadrobit,He's a very dark brown color.
31-05-2020T04:37:56,Dadrobit,The lighting is what brightens it so much
31-05-2020T04:38:07,Dadrobit,"Also, he was very sad in that pic."
31-05-2020T04:38:20,AspiringNoodle,Whyyyyy??? :ptv-whiny:
31-05-2020T04:38:47,Dadrobit,"I was still sick, or it was while I was just barely recovering. I couldn't go outside to play, so be brought it inside for me instead."
31-05-2020T04:39:45,AspiringNoodle,Dogs are too pure for this world T_T
31-05-2020T04:40:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom out

31-05-2020T04:52:39,AspiringNoodle,I'm getting REALLY effing tired of this AAA trend of companies implementing MAJOR fundamental changes well after a game has launched

31-05-2020T23:13:26,AspiringNoodle,I touch my face constantly
31-05-2020T23:13:32,AspiringNoodle,And that was BEFORE the goatee :ptv-shock:
31-05-2020T23:14:20,AspiringNoodle,"Okay, I can't stop squeeing"
31-05-2020T23:14:35,AspiringNoodle,I made Lo-Fi Kat my new wallpaper
31-05-2020T23:17:09,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-katwet:
31-05-2020T23:37:34,SpazztasticKiwi,drowned Kat
31-05-2020T23:39:00,CrRAR,:owl:
31-05-2020T23:39:34,CrRAR,couldn‚Äôt sleep; still awake
31-05-2020T23:39:47,Dadrobit,#Relatable
31-05-2020T23:40:08,Ordithus,quite
31-05-2020T23:41:29,Dadrobit,Got to work and my doorbell is still freaking broken...
31-05-2020T23:41:44,CrRAR,huh
31-05-2020T23:41:58,CrRAR,Guess that means no visitors
31-05-2020T23:42:27,Dadrobit,This is the same HOA who took a month to replace our broken gates after a quick series of unfortunate events broke all of them.
31-05-2020T23:42:39,CrRAR,Wow
31-05-2020T23:42:49,CrRAR,Sounds eventful
31-05-2020T23:42:51,Dadrobit,For a month I manned a gated community with no gates.
31-05-2020T23:43:11,Dadrobit,So I don't expect a doorbell to be... High priority...
31-05-2020T23:43:24,CrRAR,Don the goalie pads getup!
31-05-2020T23:43:52,CrRAR,Prolly not
31-05-2020T23:43:55,Dadrobit,"Nah, I just put out a traffic cone."
31-05-2020T23:44:10,CrRAR,lol
31-05-2020T23:44:19,Dadrobit,It was pretty much just an honor system.
31-05-2020T23:44:47,CrRAR,*sign pokes out from traffic cone hole*
31-05-2020T23:44:59,CrRAR,‚ÄúNo one SHALL PASS‚Äù
31-05-2020T23:45:48,CrRAR,Sounds like a somewhat chill hoa
31-05-2020T23:46:13,CrRAR,Not the average neurotic nightmare
31-05-2020T23:46:13,Dadrobit,"For real though. In one day, the visitor lane arm servo broke in the open position and then an assholes going too fast rammed through our residents fast pass lane busting those gates."
31-05-2020T23:46:40,CrRAR,Fast PASS lane!?
31-05-2020T23:46:49,Ordithus,night peeps
31-05-2020T23:46:54,Ordithus,:ptv-sleepy:
31-05-2020T23:46:56,CrRAR,Sounds like a disney ride
31-05-2020T23:46:58,Dadrobit,"Next day the residents lane was fixed, but ANOTHER asshole immediately did the same thing breaking them again!"
31-05-2020T23:47:12,CrRAR,:v: ord! C:
31-05-2020T23:47:30,CrRAR,wow
31-05-2020T23:47:55,Dadrobit,And suddenly we were out of options. So the traffic cone came out and everyone had to be treated as a visitor. Made a lot of residents very upset.
31-05-2020T23:48:12,Dadrobit,Cya Ord! o/
31-05-2020T23:48:41,CrRAR,You would think the residents would actually care about the one mecanism slowing the progress of nefarios interlopers
31-05-2020T23:50:58,Dadrobit,Like I said before. Most folks don't want real security. They want a concierge with a badge to greet them as they enter.
31-05-2020T23:51:43,CrRAR,Not a bad gig
31-05-2020T23:56:16,Dadrobit,"99% of the time it's pretty awesome. Great pay, guaranteed hours and overtime. Comfy chair. Not a lot to complain about other than a broken doorbell really."
