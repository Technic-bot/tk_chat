16-03-2020T02:37:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Alonzo Lerone did a review on the new kfc doughnut chicken sandwich - $12.82
16-03-2020T02:39:01,SpazztasticKiwi,he says it ain’t worth it getting 2 “sandwiches” but I could’ve judged that by the name
16-03-2020T02:41:29,AspiringNoodle,...*sigh*

16-03-2020T08:26:28,Dadrobit,Had half a mind to wait in my car until the doors open then bust on in to the front of the line since I was still in my security uniform and act like I was supposed to be there.

16-03-2020T17:06:50,SpazztasticKiwi,like sims
16-03-2020T17:27:54,AspiringNoodle,Hah. I'd argue WoW is the best time waster :P
16-03-2020T17:28:05,AspiringNoodle,It's gotten 14 years from me @w@
16-03-2020T17:28:34,BadFoMo,@Kameloh When will this stream start?

16-03-2020T17:31:22,BadFoMo,Thanks.
16-03-2020T17:33:32,AspiringNoodle,Can't wait to see what weird things tom will try to do
16-03-2020T17:51:11,IronHorseComics,oh you're streaming today Kame? neat
16-03-2020T17:51:59,IronHorseComics,I'd stream too but I'd be just writing... plus I'm not sure what I would draw today. maybe concept art or color more of Tom's sketches and play with block shading
16-03-2020T17:58:38,RimaDraws,yay
16-03-2020T18:34:55,AspiringNoodle,O_O
16-03-2020T18:35:04,AspiringNoodle,Covid is bad but didn't think it was THIS bad
16-03-2020T18:59:41,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
16-03-2020T19:22:26,K3IDRAN,Ilm thinking  of Releasing my singles  ''Twokinds'' and'' 1ne over The other''
16-03-2020T19:22:46,Kameloh,Tom might be afk... not sure if he took a nap :cat:
16-03-2020T19:23:18,IronHorseComics,well he's certainly not in the chat
16-03-2020T19:25:59,Kameloh,also I can't connec tto steeam
16-03-2020T19:27:03,AspiringNoodle,Oh no
16-03-2020T19:27:07,AspiringNoodle,Covid has infected the interwebs
16-03-2020T19:27:12,AspiringNoodle,we doomed! :ptv-shock:
16-03-2020T19:28:25,Aatu,D:
16-03-2020T19:28:39,AspiringNoodle,"In all seriousness, did you guys hear how bad it REALLY is???"
16-03-2020T19:28:56,IronHorseComics,"""Our universe is doomed!"" ""DOOOOOOOOOOOOMED!"""
16-03-2020T19:29:22,BlackjacksSec99,"in CA, can confirm, very bad"
16-03-2020T19:29:30,AspiringNoodle,This thing is so big that it's gotten BOTH US parties to agree to a stimulus package to citizens...
16-03-2020T19:30:04,AspiringNoodle,"For now, speculation is $1000, and tax payments are being pushed 90 days"
16-03-2020T19:30:31,AspiringNoodle,"If it gets BOTH sides of the aisle to agree to something no contest, it must be REALLY bad :ptv-shock:"
16-03-2020T19:31:06,AspiringNoodle,"First I was in it for the memes, now I'm genuinely concerned..."
16-03-2020T19:31:30,BlackjacksSec99,250 billion in direct payments is the talk which is about 760 ish per person
16-03-2020T19:32:27,BlackjacksSec99,1 trillion is the plan to 'inject into the economy with about 250 billion of that as direct payments' which means more cash for the ultra rich CEOs.
16-03-2020T19:32:51,BlackjacksSec99,AKA a great way to set fire to 750 billion
16-03-2020T19:34:24,AspiringNoodle,I would hope that that money would go towards businesses that can't run right now
16-03-2020T19:34:50,AspiringNoodle,"Like, restaurants can't run unless they do only takeout, but that still means reduced cash flow."
16-03-2020T19:35:03,AspiringNoodle,"And when slim-profit-margin industries can't run... well, it's not good"
16-03-2020T19:35:33,AspiringNoodle,I saw something earlier that freaked me out just a smidge.  Went to a local gas station chain called Sheetz

16-03-2020T19:49:28,AspiringNoodle,I washed my hands first. Covid / gas dispensing and such :P
16-03-2020T19:50:09,AspiringNoodle,"Exit the restroom to see the dining area cordoned off (expected that), and the store was really empty, which is unusual.  Didn't seem like MTO was open, but then I see a roller grill filled to the brim with hot dogs"
16-03-2020T19:51:17,AspiringNoodle,"Like, it was just scary seeing it that full.  This was during lunch rush hours.  Guess people really are staying home"

16-03-2020T20:13:39,IronHorseComics,it just took some work for it to work
16-03-2020T20:15:41,LittleNapoleon,this is giving me flashbacks to trying to troubleshoot playing red alert online in 1996 XD

16-03-2020T20:39:37,MoonDance,The most expensive coffee I've seen is in Japan. It's like almost a grand for a small cup
16-03-2020T20:40:12,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,hello?
16-03-2020T20:40:25,MoonDance,They like age the drink like liquor. And is not as bitter and thicker
16-03-2020T20:40:26,AspiringNoodle,stupid stream keeps buffering D:<
16-03-2020T20:40:56,AspiringNoodle,"Picarto doesn't like it when I try to play games and stream at the same time, lol"
16-03-2020T20:41:35,MoonDance,I've been watching a lot of vending machine vids from Japan. I never relize how many they are that cook it's weird
16-03-2020T20:42:19,AspiringNoodle,Japan is the vending machine capital of the world. You can get fresh pizza from vending machines
16-03-2020T20:42:40,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, Japan is the poster child of healthy diets"
16-03-2020T20:43:05,AspiringNoodle,"Oh yeah, that's a BIG thing in Japan.  Don't walk and eat."
16-03-2020T20:43:08,MoonDance,They treat they livestock really well for the most part. Like the reason why eggs are so vibrant is because it's what they gave the animals.
16-03-2020T20:43:13,AspiringNoodle,"Finish eating, then move."
16-03-2020T20:43:30,MoonDance,It's consider rude to leave the area where you buy your snack
16-03-2020T20:44:02,AspiringNoodle,Japan: *almost no trash cans anywhere* *people will carry trash for long periods of time until they find one*
16-03-2020T20:44:35,AspiringNoodle,"America: *trash cans everywhere* *can't be assed to take 3 seconds to throw something out, too much effort, just throw on ground*"

16-03-2020T20:45:01,IronHorseComics,very brave of them with the virus
16-03-2020T20:45:16,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, I'm kinda pissed about the whole Olympics in Japan thing"
16-03-2020T20:45:33,AspiringNoodle,"Japan is censoring themselves to ""protect"" the sensibilities of foreigners"
16-03-2020T20:45:33,TeapotOfDoom,going to japan in september probably
16-03-2020T20:45:43,IronHorseComics,not as pissed as I was about the Fifa World cup in Qatar
16-03-2020T20:45:55,TeapotOfDoom,not nealy as
16-03-2020T20:45:55,IronHorseComics,they're still hellbent on going to that wasteland

16-03-2020T20:46:25,RimaDraws,hiii
16-03-2020T20:46:38,IronHorseComics,they should have stripped them of it when they got busted for the bribing
16-03-2020T20:46:42,SpazztasticKiwi,no the ones that jinxed us was those that toasted to the “roaring 20s part 2” on new years
16-03-2020T20:46:46,MoonDance,I read about that before the pandemic. Supposedly a lot of people didn't want to go or eat the food because of where the food was from. The location being too close to Fukushima
16-03-2020T20:46:51,IronHorseComics,the head of Fifa resigned for it
16-03-2020T20:47:39,IronHorseComics,or if everyone wore heavy duty gas masks
16-03-2020T20:47:41,MoonDance,The location where the food is near Fukushima and that's where the nuclear accident happen a while back. People worried the food isn't fully containment free
16-03-2020T20:47:56,TeapotOfDoom,how fitting xD
16-03-2020T20:48:02,RimaDraws,okay...

16-03-2020T21:36:49,AspiringNoodle,But most 3d games go for realism to an absurd degree

16-03-2020T21:37:14,AspiringNoodle,"Part of it is that 3d lends itself well to that end, especially with the advances made in the past decade"

16-03-2020T22:45:34,LittleNapoleon,"ars technica did a neat piece on the early development of the game, and all the hurdles they had to overcome ^^"

16-03-2020T22:46:37,AspiringNoodle,"It's funny, serious sam 2 had an unkillable scorpion monster that only appeared if you pirated the game"
16-03-2020T22:46:48,AspiringNoodle,The entire point was to make the game near impossible and make the pirates rage quit
16-03-2020T22:47:09,Kameloh,that's cool!
16-03-2020T22:47:09,AspiringNoodle,Now I wanna look up if there are any speedruns with the pirated version as a category

16-03-2020T22:53:00,AspiringNoodle,"Mirror's Edge, when you approach the first jump, your character is slowly drained of all momentum, moving at a :snail: pace the closer they get to the edge, making it impossible to get further in the game"
16-03-2020T22:54:20,AspiringNoodle,"Batman Arkum Asylum removed the ability to glide.  Similar to Mirror's Edge, you could play the game, but you couldn't get far in the first level :P"

16-03-2020T22:56:25,AspiringNoodle,If you manage to reomance another character and get to the sex scene

16-03-2020T23:04:54,AspiringNoodle,One thing that's easy to notice in earlier shooter titles
16-03-2020T23:05:15,AspiringNoodle,The lack of flinching / secondary action in the mechanics / animation
16-03-2020T23:06:02,AspiringNoodle,"Stuff tends to move in its own bubble and completely ignore things.  Enemy being shot?  Only indication is blood spatters.  They die?  They either explode, or kinda stay still before falling over"
