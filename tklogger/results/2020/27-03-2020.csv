27-03-2020T00:18:06,CrimsonHelsing,"What's that language, Rough? I know what it means but the language eludes me"
27-03-2020T00:18:06,steelabjur,Guardians reaction to Flora reminds me of Nora's first encounter with her.
27-03-2020T00:18:18,Roughlandin,It's Demonic for Rip and Tear.
27-03-2020T00:18:22,Roughlandin,From Doom
27-03-2020T00:18:33,CrimsonHelsing,I know what it means
27-03-2020T00:18:37,CrimsonHelsing,the language eluded me
27-03-2020T00:18:40,ThingsAreMoving,Demonic seems like an easy language to pronounce
27-03-2020T00:18:52,Dragusthor,yes i remember hahahaha
27-03-2020T00:18:57,BlackjackSec99,its a pretty gravelly language
27-03-2020T00:18:58,Roughlandin,Lots of guttural single syllables
27-03-2020T00:19:10,ThingsAreMoving,So... basically klingon
27-03-2020T00:19:13,CrimsonHelsing,"didn't know if it was Argentian, Demonic, or something else introduced in Eternal"
27-03-2020T00:19:44,Roughlandin,"If you haven't heard the Doom Eternal Soundtrack yet, look up Kar En Tuk. Seriously terrified me with just a song"
27-03-2020T00:20:02,CrimsonHelsing,oh a friend already showed me Gladiator

27-03-2020T00:28:37,longneccman,with parts made in japan?
27-03-2020T00:28:41,Roughlandin,Same could be said for Rose
27-03-2020T00:29:04,Roughlandin,"@longneccman: Secret, secret. I've got a secret."
27-03-2020T00:29:15,CrimsonHelsing,"well 'round this time he's been alone in there for... idk, at least five or six months, since Trace took off for Pinewood in the spring"
27-03-2020T00:29:43,Ordithus,nothing for a rock
27-03-2020T00:29:45,Roughlandin,I thought it had been at least a year in comic

27-03-2020T00:30:08,CrimsonHelsing,"details, gotta look into the details, my friend"
27-03-2020T00:30:17,CrimsonHelsing,almost everyone misses a good deal of them
27-03-2020T00:30:19,Roughlandin,I thought that bonus chapter on the ship was the one year mark
27-03-2020T00:30:31,Dragusthor,Yes it's correct
27-03-2020T00:30:33,Roughlandin,Of Trace and Keith meeting

27-03-2020T00:31:52,Roughlandin,Hmmm... I guess that's right. Unless Mekkan seasons are like Westerosi ones...
27-03-2020T00:32:27,johnnytho,wait so a year and some months have passed in the story
27-03-2020T00:32:29,johnnytho,?
27-03-2020T00:32:29,longneccman,also it definitely ain't been a year because it hasn't even been 9 months

27-03-2020T20:53:00,SpazztasticKiwi,today a guy wanted a pound of bologna on sandwich cut (1) but he wanted 3 ~half inch thick slices
27-03-2020T20:53:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"and the half inch thickness would be more like a 4-5 cut, while sandwich cut is 1"
27-03-2020T20:55:50,CrRAR,Big meaty sandwich
27-03-2020T20:56:24,CrRAR,"tbh, at that point, should just have a hot dog"
27-03-2020T20:58:06,SpazztasticKiwi,nah ya don’t get it
27-03-2020T20:58:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"dude wanted “sandwich cut”, but that’s a 1 yet he wants a pound with 3 slices cut half an inch thick"
27-03-2020T20:59:18,SpazztasticKiwi,3 slices won’t make a pound on sandwich cut
27-03-2020T20:59:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"if you want sandwich cut, it won’t be a half inch thick"
27-03-2020T20:59:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"if you want sandwich cut, there will be more than 3 slices"
27-03-2020T21:00:37,SpazztasticKiwi,felt like a bugs bunny in that straight jacket moment
