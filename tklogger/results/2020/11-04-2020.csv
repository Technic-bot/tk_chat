11-04-2020T15:03:55,AspiringNoodle,Glomped master after he returned from being away forever
11-04-2020T15:03:56,ThingsAreMoving,"also, nice movie reference"

11-04-2020T15:04:09,ProsePro7,Who is her?  Who was Stoneward made to protect
11-04-2020T15:04:14,AspiringNoodle,...Saria
11-04-2020T15:04:21,ProsePro7,Are you sure
11-04-2020T15:04:21,ThingsAreMoving,The tentacle thingy
11-04-2020T15:04:22,ThingsAreMoving,probably

11-04-2020T15:05:23,sodaYEET,im in online class rn lol
11-04-2020T15:05:23,ProsePro7,And this looks like after Saria is dead.  How would this protect her?
11-04-2020T15:05:29,BlackjackSec99,wait.... does this mean Saria's body is there?!?!?!?!?!
11-04-2020T15:05:39,ProsePro7,Or some other part of her

11-04-2020T15:06:05,ThingsAreMoving,What makes you say that memory is after Saria's death?
11-04-2020T15:06:08,ProsePro7,"Remember the black spirits were excited that Maren was there that they finally ""had a body"""
11-04-2020T15:06:35,Twokinds,The flashback is from before Saria's death.
11-04-2020T15:06:46,Twokinds,The hint is Trace not being crazy.
11-04-2020T15:06:46,sodaYEET,hi tom
11-04-2020T15:06:49,ImTheBeyondPale,0/
11-04-2020T15:06:54,ThingsAreMoving,Looked like it.
11-04-2020T15:06:56,ProsePro7,Still why would Nora care about Saria?
11-04-2020T15:06:59,ThingsAreMoving,"also, hi Tom o/"
11-04-2020T15:07:12,AspiringNoodle,She doesn't.  She wants to get into bed with Trace :P
11-04-2020T15:07:15,ThingsAreMoving,It's Trace asking Nora for some form of guardian
11-04-2020T15:07:30,Twokinds,Because it's her best friend's fiance.
11-04-2020T15:07:38,ProsePro7,But if she wouldnt do it for him they why would saying its for her change her mind.
11-04-2020T15:07:44,Twokinds,Sort of a social obligation to be nice to the new family of a good friend.
11-04-2020T15:07:52,ProsePro7,Okay
11-04-2020T15:07:59,FenceEqualizer,You’re making t way more complex then it is prose
11-04-2020T15:08:05,ThingsAreMoving,^

11-04-2020T15:09:14,AspiringNoodle,We all know where this is going
11-04-2020T15:09:23,Twokinds,"Trace is always wanting to make a big show for Saria. Nora cares for Trace, so she's often dragged along on his schemes."
11-04-2020T15:09:29,FenceEqualizer,Forever golem friend?
11-04-2020T15:09:51,ProsePro7,But it still failed
11-04-2020T15:09:56,ProsePro7,Still curious about that
11-04-2020T15:10:30,ProsePro7,So whats it guarding now
11-04-2020T15:10:50,AspiringNoodle,Odds are some setup for reviving Saria
11-04-2020T15:10:52,ThingsAreMoving,We'll see soon

11-04-2020T15:11:31,ProsePro7,One of those doors probably has Maren in a bod pod having her soul sucked out
11-04-2020T15:11:43,ProsePro7,Being replaced with Saria
11-04-2020T15:11:49,AspiringNoodle,Or maybe an X-man Apocalypse style altar :3

11-04-2020T15:12:54,FenceEqualizer,Make Maren a vessel for Saria.
11-04-2020T15:13:39,ProsePro7,That would explain why he started dating her
11-04-2020T15:14:22,AspiringNoodle,Still

11-04-2020T15:15:58,ProsePro7,I wonder if it means they have a short memory and Trace will have to repeat orders over and over
11-04-2020T15:15:59,AspiringNoodle,But they were a bit stiff

11-04-2020T15:37:59,Avolendi,Feedback: Looks good and nicely done on paper. The two sketches are a bit close though. Maybe in the future try to define the desired size beforehand? Also the weapon is kinda hard to read with little contrast to the main body.

11-04-2020T15:39:15,Avolendi,"Not sure how to best solve that, though maybe keep a small gap between items of different depth? Other options are using shading / color / contrast to distinguish shapes"

11-04-2020T15:39:55,CrimsonQuill,I'm still trying to get the hang of that TBH...I think I did the contrast better on Luke's portrait...I kinda rushed Raine's towards the end.

11-04-2020T15:42:03,ProsePro7,Not just good mornings?  Thats nice to hear
11-04-2020T15:42:12,CrimsonQuill,Mine's too serious..
11-04-2020T15:42:15,BlackjackSec99,lets go for funny rather than fan service this time lol
11-04-2020T15:42:22,Avolendi,Tools are a bonus. Pen and paper is good enough (even without special pencils). Spending time and discipline is more important
11-04-2020T15:42:26,TerraTheWizard,"i put in my silly good morning one again, because i asked people if they still wanted it"
11-04-2020T15:42:31,Thereddragon525,"Cool, I can't wait to see what happens."
11-04-2020T15:42:36,CrimsonQuill,Yeah...though I honestly don't consider them all fanservice
11-04-2020T15:42:46,CrimsonQuill,I find Raine and Kathrin's ones to be Angelic
11-04-2020T15:42:54,CrimsonQuill,It's like looking at a Rembrandt
11-04-2020T15:43:11,ThingsAreMoving,The man himself or his paintings?
11-04-2020T15:43:12,ProsePro7,I'm sorry did someone say lewd the Raine
11-04-2020T15:43:14,CrimsonQuill,"Like 'Belshazzar's Feast', 'Woman holding a Glove'"
11-04-2020T15:43:16,CrimsonQuill,The paintings
11-04-2020T15:43:20,CrimsonQuill,No
11-04-2020T15:43:27,CrimsonQuill,I said she looks Angelic
11-04-2020T15:43:28,CrimsonQuill,As in
11-04-2020T15:43:29,Avolendi,"That having been said, how you spend your time is harder to provide advice on. Since depending on whether you can motivate yourself or need external guidance, different approaches are better"
11-04-2020T15:43:32,ThingsAreMoving,Raine is the one who lewds
11-04-2020T15:43:34,ThingsAreMoving,in her fanfics
11-04-2020T15:43:38,BlackjackSec99,lol
11-04-2020T15:43:40,CrimsonQuill,XD
11-04-2020T15:43:47,CrimsonQuill,When did that joke even start?
11-04-2020T15:43:58,ProsePro7,Old sketch
11-04-2020T15:44:00,CrimsonQuill,'Cause I just can't imagine canon Raine actually going there
11-04-2020T15:44:04,ProsePro7,two years ago?
11-04-2020T15:44:18,Thereddragon525,I think it was a sketch but it is still funny.
11-04-2020T15:44:20,CrimsonQuill,Fanfiction fan or Ember meeting her at the library?
11-04-2020T15:44:44,CrimsonQuill,Seriously though

11-04-2020T17:24:01,Mandag,Does Natani have shorter hair here than she does in the main comic? Maybe this is from before she met Keith?
11-04-2020T17:24:16,tehbear,or its just not in view

11-04-2020T21:07:37,FenceEqualizer,I was like wtf is this suggestion.
11-04-2020T21:07:40,KeefMcDerpface,Kat punching the ATM machine?
11-04-2020T21:08:00,ProsePro7,Tom draws her super realistic like he did Mrs Nibbly that one time
11-04-2020T21:09:08,Dadrobit,"I imagine a deadpan ""That's not funny"" scowl at either the ATM or the audience."
11-04-2020T21:09:17,Ordithus,"Thanks for the stream, Tom!"

11-04-2020T21:11:42,unsteddyphoenix,I aint even mad
11-04-2020T21:11:48,FenceEqualizer,"Wonder who put that suggestion in and I wonder if it was for luls or if they're really tired of Kat suggestions, lol"
11-04-2020T21:12:19,Dadrobit,I almost wish I did. But even I wouldn't do unsteddy like that.
11-04-2020T21:12:38,Ordithus,"It's unique, I'll give it that"
11-04-2020T21:12:50,ProsePro7,"Alot of characters are over drawn, hence why Tom rage quit at the end of the stream"
11-04-2020T21:13:16,xcvb,To much Maren?
11-04-2020T21:13:21,FenceEqualizer,I think that's less over drawn and more that last one was like six characters.
11-04-2020T21:13:23,unsteddyphoenix,"Lol, not sure about that one"
11-04-2020T21:13:35,Dadrobit,"It sounds like a cookie cutter insult to overdrawn characters in general, like Sonic OC's and the like, but I'll give it a pass here."
11-04-2020T21:14:27,xcvb,or  did Tom Draw the rest of current page and was exhausted from that alone?
11-04-2020T21:14:39,Ordithus,He must have done that today or late yesterday
11-04-2020T21:14:41,unsteddyphoenix,"Its funny as a suggestion, I thin kactually drawing it would be jumping the shark"
11-04-2020T21:14:54,ProsePro7,As usual he hasnt been sleeping or eating so he was tired
11-04-2020T21:15:02,FenceEqualizer,I mean if it won the vote.
11-04-2020T21:15:04,ProsePro7,He just had to take a break
11-04-2020T21:15:17,xcvb,power nap
11-04-2020T21:15:36,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah I mean if it did it'd be less funny, you know?"
11-04-2020T21:16:10,FenceEqualizer,True enough.
11-04-2020T21:16:40,unsteddyphoenix,"Although, if it gets voted it basically proves itself true lol"
11-04-2020T21:16:55,RimaDraws,he should be on a regular eating and sleeping schedule
11-04-2020T21:17:06,FenceEqualizer,If it won I bet it would become the next trend.
11-04-2020T21:17:16,FenceEqualizer,Like a spiteful trend.
11-04-2020T21:17:31,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha I could see it

11-04-2020T21:28:59,Twokinds,Does anyone know anything about generators
11-04-2020T21:29:06,ProsePro7,A little
11-04-2020T21:29:12,AspiringNoodle,"Oh no, are you using a generator to power your home?!?"
11-04-2020T21:29:13,Ordithus,"A bit, never had one though"
11-04-2020T21:29:15,RimaDraws,no sorrt
11-04-2020T21:29:15,xcvb,like what do you need Tom?
11-04-2020T21:29:31,Twokinds,"I'm looking into buying a generator for my house, so I'm not without power again."
11-04-2020T21:29:34,ProsePro7,AspiringNoodle
11-04-2020T21:29:40,ProsePro7,true
11-04-2020T21:29:57,WINDOWS98SE,"Yes.  Generator + suicide cord + dryer socket = cheap, emergency power backup."
11-04-2020T21:29:59,ProsePro7,How big is your House Tom?
11-04-2020T21:30:35,xcvb,go for a 2-3kWh one
11-04-2020T21:30:39,Ordithus,Can't gor wrong with a honda
11-04-2020T21:30:45,Twokinds,I'd just need enough to power the computer and internet
11-04-2020T21:30:55,xcvb,oh
11-04-2020T21:31:04,Ordithus,That could be really small
11-04-2020T21:31:09,WINDOWS98SE,I use a Champion 3500.
11-04-2020T21:31:33,Ordithus,Did the house stay reasonably warm during the outage?
11-04-2020T21:31:42,InTheLionsDen,"Yes, it makes a big difference if you are not trying to power the entire house."
11-04-2020T21:31:47,ProsePro7,If you hook it up to your house you need one big enough to run the whole thing for just your computer and stuff then a small one but you will have to run a cord
11-04-2020T21:31:51,xcvb,"2,5kWh, don't forget about your fridge"
11-04-2020T21:32:36,Ordithus,Maaan looking for that genderswap of the genderswap au and I found this again https://www.deviantart.com/twokinds/art/Unspoken-Friendship-707761458
11-04-2020T21:32:38,ProsePro7,I would still suggest the whole house since you will need wi fi unless you use your phone or some other system
11-04-2020T21:32:41,Ordithus,The feels :ctwokinds-LauraCry:
11-04-2020T21:32:58,WINDOWS98SE,"@ProsePro7 You don't have to run a cord throughout the house, just flip the mains breaker and backfeed."
11-04-2020T21:33:24,RimaDraws,i love that one
11-04-2020T21:33:41,johnnytho,Ord thats the type of stuff I'd wish people would suggest more.
11-04-2020T21:33:54,Twokinds,That's more than I know how to do. I'm just looking for a small unit that I can plug my computer stuff.
11-04-2020T21:34:16,Twokinds,Would need to generate clean power
11-04-2020T21:34:26,ProsePro7,@WINDOWS98SE Ya still have to hook up to the house
11-04-2020T21:34:38,ProsePro7,If ya do that just get a big one
11-04-2020T21:34:54,WINDOWS98SE,@twokinds Best would be an invertor generator.
11-04-2020T21:35:19,Ordithus,clean as in good electricity or as in not blegh smoke and gross
11-04-2020T21:35:20,WINDOWS98SE,You could still just run and extension cable (if you don't feel comfortable beckfeeding).
11-04-2020T21:35:30,InTheLionsDen,Run a small generator through a UPS to stabilize the output.
11-04-2020T21:36:02,Twokinds,"Yeah, an inverter looks like what I need"
11-04-2020T21:36:16,xcvb,gas or diesel?
11-04-2020T21:36:30,WINDOWS98SE,Diesel's quite expensive (upfront cost).
11-04-2020T21:36:39,ProsePro7,Better long run
11-04-2020T21:36:47,xcvb,but more reliable on milage
11-04-2020T21:37:21,ProsePro7,Diesels cleaner too if you're in a pinch ya can use cooking oil
11-04-2020T21:37:51,Twokinds,"Uh, just gas"
11-04-2020T21:37:58,ProsePro7,HAHAH
11-04-2020T21:38:02,xcvb,inverter hooked up to your car's acu unit
11-04-2020T21:38:29,Ordithus,that's enough to run a laptop
11-04-2020T21:38:43,ProsePro7,Would wifi still work
11-04-2020T21:39:10,InTheLionsDen,Not planning for the apocalypse here. Keep it simple and inexpensive.
11-04-2020T21:39:28,Ordithus,"at least even if you didn't have internet, you could probably still work (depending on how photoshop handles licenses)"
11-04-2020T21:39:36,xcvb,"simple gas unit with 2kWh marking will do for 1,25kW constant work"
11-04-2020T21:39:52,ProsePro7,Get an extension cord
11-04-2020T21:40:55,Twokinds,"I don't need wifi, I can just plug in the modem."
11-04-2020T21:41:10,ProsePro7,Ah good old reliable
11-04-2020T21:41:37,Twokinds,Unless something really bad happened and the internet lines are down too
11-04-2020T21:41:59,Twokinds,Then I guess I'd have to get internet off my phone
11-04-2020T21:42:04,xcvb,or upload with your cellphone
11-04-2020T21:42:19,ProsePro7,In an ice storm they might.  But other wise the phone and internet are very reliable
11-04-2020T21:42:21,Ordithus,"can always use dial up, phone lines always are the last thing to die :ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:"
11-04-2020T21:42:38,FenceEqualizer,Unless you're in a horror movie
11-04-2020T21:42:40,ProsePro7,You use your phone and your hotspot will explode

11-04-2020T21:52:03,WINDOWS98SE,"@Twokinds If you're looking for recommendations, I'd start with this one:"

11-04-2020T21:52:19,WINDOWS98SE,"It's an inverter, gas powered one.  Should be sufficient to power all your computer equipment + a few other things like fridges and freezers."
11-04-2020T21:52:32,WINDOWS98SE,"If you want a few extra watts, go for something like:"
11-04-2020T21:52:35,WINDOWS98SE,championpowerequipment.com/product/100302-4000-watt-digital-hybrid-open-frame-inverter/
11-04-2020T21:53:04,ProsePro7,Looks like a good one
11-04-2020T21:53:46,Ordithus,Any of those have plenty of power
11-04-2020T21:54:56,WINDOWS98SE,"Also, just be aware of maintenance requirements.  When storing generators long term, it's a good idea to run them dry (make sure there's no gas in the tank), and put a spoonful of oil into the spark plug socket."
11-04-2020T21:54:56,xcvb,Fridge condenser usues a lot of power on startup
11-04-2020T21:55:33,WINDOWS98SE,"@Ordithus Both should have plenty for all Tom's electronics (with clean power too).  For things like central AC, no, don't think it's be wnough."
11-04-2020T21:55:38,WINDOWS98SE,*enough
11-04-2020T21:55:43,ProsePro7,@WINDOWS98SE Is this your job or just a hobby?
11-04-2020T21:56:02,Ordithus,"A smaller AC unit needs a ~20 amp circuit, 240V"
11-04-2020T21:56:05,WINDOWS98SE,Hobby I guess.  Had to do research on it in a hurry one time my power went out.
11-04-2020T21:56:18,xcvb,USA goes on 120V
11-04-2020T21:56:19,ProsePro7,Impressive
11-04-2020T21:56:55,Ordithus,I can recommend snowblowers :cw0lfmare-Saltyember:
11-04-2020T21:58:00,ProsePro7,He says at the start of spring
11-04-2020T21:58:07,Ordithus,it's a lie
11-04-2020T21:58:11,Ordithus,lies!
11-04-2020T21:58:19,xcvb,thats when winter kicks on ;)
11-04-2020T21:58:19,Ordithus,winter never ends
11-04-2020T21:58:33,Ordithus,"last year it snowed in May, TWICE"
11-04-2020T21:58:47,xcvb,last week here
11-04-2020T21:58:52,ProsePro7,Winter is coming?  No winter is here bitch its been here for a while now
11-04-2020T21:59:07,ProsePro7,Snowed here too
11-04-2020T21:59:14,Ordithus,same
11-04-2020T21:59:35,ProsePro7,What ever happened to global warming?
11-04-2020T21:59:47,xcvb,ask Greta
11-04-2020T21:59:52,johnnytho,I wish it'd snow here
11-04-2020T21:59:57,ProsePro7,How dare you
11-04-2020T22:00:08,johnnytho,How dare you
11-04-2020T22:00:11,Twokinds,Generators are so expensive
11-04-2020T22:00:18,RimaDraws,yea they are
11-04-2020T22:00:22,InTheLionsDen,Yes
11-04-2020T22:00:34,xcvb,"Yes, yes they are"
11-04-2020T22:00:41,ProsePro7,How much do you make on patreon again
11-04-2020T22:00:56,johnnytho,Bruh
11-04-2020T22:01:23,xcvb,How many generator can you buy from patreon alone?

11-04-2020T22:02:21,InTheLionsDen,^
11-04-2020T22:02:23,RimaDraws,hm
11-04-2020T22:02:33,Twokinds,The one recommended was $1k
11-04-2020T22:02:41,RimaDraws,dang
11-04-2020T22:02:49,RimaDraws,that's my monthly income
11-04-2020T22:02:58,Ordithus,That's a lot of coffee
11-04-2020T22:03:09,xcvb,go for a $600 one
11-04-2020T22:03:12,Ordithus,"Buy coffee, hook yourself up to a dynamo"
11-04-2020T22:03:14,SpazztasticKiwi,global warming is climate change which means more and heavier season changes and weather events
11-04-2020T22:03:25,Twokinds,"The Honda one, which is apparently the one everyone say to get, is actually more than $2k"
11-04-2020T22:03:30,Twokinds,But that seems a little excessive
11-04-2020T22:03:30,SpazztasticKiwi,be scared when the south finally starts getting snow
11-04-2020T22:03:38,ProsePro7,What was that about not taking commissions Tom?
11-04-2020T22:04:01,xcvb,don't go overkill
11-04-2020T22:04:12,RimaDraws,do you need a donation
11-04-2020T22:04:26,xcvb,a basic one with current smoothing will do
11-04-2020T22:04:26,WINDOWS98SE,"You could get a cheaper, non-inverter one (what I use), and run it through a surge protector (or better yet, a UPS).  May work out cheaper."
11-04-2020T22:04:30,ProsePro7,Like hell he makes more money than me and I have a real job
11-04-2020T22:04:38,SpazztasticKiwi,don’t be rude
11-04-2020T22:04:44,ProsePro7,Just playing
11-04-2020T22:04:45,RimaDraws,i mean no need to be rude prose
11-04-2020T22:04:49,johnnytho,What is your problem dude
11-04-2020T22:04:51,RimaDraws,i was actually offering
11-04-2020T22:05:05,ProsePro7,Alright calm down.  I see the line now
11-04-2020T22:05:19,SpazztasticKiwi,legit would ask if I can have a small wallet card colored of baby Nibs
11-04-2020T22:05:25,WINDOWS98SE,"Also, generators across the board may be up in price or hard to come by due to the current virus situation."
11-04-2020T22:05:28,SpazztasticKiwi,can you imagine how those would sell?
11-04-2020T22:05:35,RimaDraws,heck i would love to have a poster
11-04-2020T22:05:59,xcvb,or like @WINDOWS98SE said much cheaper one with a UPS
11-04-2020T22:06:16,Ordithus,I guess that's why so few people have them
11-04-2020T22:06:24,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-adiracoin:
11-04-2020T22:06:30,RimaDraws,might get me one of my art i recently did. i wish...
11-04-2020T22:06:49,Twokinds,I've heard the noninverter ones don't play nice with a lot of UPSs
11-04-2020T22:06:57,Twokinds,Cause of the power fluxuations.
11-04-2020T22:07:21,Ordithus,Used?  Riskier and more work but I'm sure you could find a good one
11-04-2020T22:08:13,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-daydreamingkat: anyways gonna go use my CLEAN shower <3
11-04-2020T22:08:30,ProsePro7,Bye Ord

11-04-2020T22:08:45,SpazztasticKiwi,don’t have an existential crisis
11-04-2020T22:08:46,Dadrobit,Back for a wee bit.
11-04-2020T22:08:51,Dadrobit,o/ Ord

11-04-2020T22:09:03,Dadrobit,Howdy Rima
11-04-2020T22:09:09,RimaDraws,kame!
11-04-2020T22:09:10,InTheLionsDen,The generator needs a wattage rating three or four times higher than what you expect to load it with because the rated wattage is not intended for continuous use. It is just spike load.
11-04-2020T22:09:11,xcvb,Bye Ord o/
11-04-2020T22:09:15,Dadrobit,o/ Kame
11-04-2020T22:09:27,Kameloh,hello! just remembered I had this tab open
11-04-2020T22:09:34,RimaDraws,lol
11-04-2020T22:09:36,Dadrobit,Might be absent in a wee bit.
11-04-2020T22:09:44,WINDOWS98SE,"@Twokinds That's true actually (from what I hear).  But even so, just with a surge protector and a quality PC PSU (since they all use switch-mode), a surge protector should be sufficient.  Just don't overload the generator."
11-04-2020T22:10:01,Kameloh,I don't know anything about generators :ckameloh-naokidrink50:
11-04-2020T22:10:10,Dadrobit,"Pops is recording his next lesson for his class, he'll be sending the recording(s) my way soon-ish to edit for him."
11-04-2020T22:10:14,xcvb,@InTheLionsDen thats the peak and constant wattage of generators
11-04-2020T22:10:24,Dadrobit,But at least my homework is done for the week.
11-04-2020T22:10:51,RimaDraws,i need to get mine done
11-04-2020T22:11:31,Twokinds,I wish I knew more about electrical stuff. I only have the vaguest notions about it.
11-04-2020T22:11:52,Kameloh,could make a post somewhere on reddit if there's a subreddit for power generators
11-04-2020T22:11:59,Twokinds,My computer has a 750w power supply. Does that mean it uses at most that?
11-04-2020T22:12:03,SpazztasticKiwi,y’all wanna see what the rain has done to one of the roads
11-04-2020T22:12:05,SpazztasticKiwi,?
11-04-2020T22:12:06,xcvb,@Twokinds how much power your PC uses
11-04-2020T22:12:08,xcvb,?
11-04-2020T22:12:14,Twokinds,See above
11-04-2020T22:12:29,ProsePro7,If you type up the model then it should give the specs you need
11-04-2020T22:12:30,WINDOWS98SE,"I bet your PC very rarely, if ever uses anywhere near 750w."
11-04-2020T22:12:41,InTheLionsDen,Not just the PC. You have to add in all the other things like monitor and drawing pad.
11-04-2020T22:12:48,CrRAR,No the idle if nothing graphical is happening is much lower
11-04-2020T22:12:52,ProsePro7,True forgot that
11-04-2020T22:13:07,Twokinds,ok
11-04-2020T22:13:22,Dadrobit,"Same. I kinda understand it just because I grew up with an electrical teacher, but that tome of knowledge ends at ""factoids"" before getting to the ""just call a professional"" chapter."
11-04-2020T22:13:48,ProsePro7,Elections make alot of money for a reason
11-04-2020T22:14:02,CrRAR,"I’d imagine opearting is anywhere between like 80-500w depending on load, and what parts you have."
11-04-2020T22:14:25,Twokinds,Right now my UPS says it's under 175w of load.
11-04-2020T22:14:26,xcvb,let's say 800W
11-04-2020T22:14:33,CrRAR,Gaming stuff obvs the higher end as it uses CPU/GPU
11-04-2020T22:14:38,Twokinds,"Which seems like a low amount, but I'm not doing anything but typing here."
11-04-2020T22:14:50,CrRAR,Yeah idle sips power
11-04-2020T22:14:58,CrRAR,Really not much
11-04-2020T22:15:14,Dadrobit,"Because if you fuck up most anything else like plumbing, the worst case scenario is flood damage. But if you fuck up something like wiring, it doesn't even take a worst case scenario to burn the whole damn house down. I'll pay the fee for the professional"
11-04-2020T22:15:19,CrRAR,I have a lil box that uses like 50w
11-04-2020T22:15:21,ProsePro7,I would go with the high end of what it can do to be safe
11-04-2020T22:15:48,Twokinds,"The one I'm looking at, the $1k one, is 3000W"
11-04-2020T22:15:54,Dadrobit,"You would also need to power your Wacom though as well yeah? Probably not a ton of power, but worth factoring in."

11-04-2020T22:16:06,CrRAR,^
11-04-2020T22:16:17,Twokinds,"The cheaper ones, in the $500 - $800 range, are 2000"
11-04-2020T22:16:48,WINDOWS98SE,@Twokinds I believe that's 3000 peak watts.  Running is 2800w (still more than enough).
11-04-2020T22:17:01,xcvb,"that's 800W for, drawing screen, PC and peripherials will take power"
11-04-2020T22:17:27,WINDOWS98SE,Monitors and other peripherals use very little power.
11-04-2020T22:17:38,xcvb,yes
11-04-2020T22:17:51,CrRAR,Adds up though
11-04-2020T22:18:17,ProsePro7,But take into account upgrades may need the bigger power later
11-04-2020T22:18:37,CrRAR,"When you connect a generator doesn’t it power everything else unless you unplug it, say like a refrigerator?"
11-04-2020T22:18:53,xcvb,"plus, a full throttle rtxTK graphic card can take up to 2kNibbs /h"
11-04-2020T22:18:54,WINDOWS98SE,Only if you backfeed.
11-04-2020T22:18:56,InTheLionsDen,If it is connected to the house wiring
11-04-2020T22:19:11,ProsePro7,Tom just wants to run an extension
11-04-2020T22:19:18,CrRAR,"Oh true some have outlets to direct feed, okay lol"
11-04-2020T22:20:16,xcvb,"go for a buffered 2kW one, constant 1,4kW will be enough for at least 0.8kW PC"

11-04-2020T22:22:14,Twokinds,Yeah this might be overkill
11-04-2020T22:23:33,Dadrobit,Don't you already have a backup emergency power supply? Or are you just looking to just keep working while the power is out?
11-04-2020T22:24:12,WINDOWS98SE,"Yeah, now seems to be a bad to to buy a generator.  I was looking through ebay completed listings for the 75531i, and before the lockdowns they were going for between $300 - $500."

11-04-2020T22:25:11,WINDOWS98SE,Not an inverter generator though.
11-04-2020T22:25:25,CrRAR,I wonder how long between fuelings that thing would run at like 1/2 load.
11-04-2020T22:25:38,CrRAR,One says up to 11.5 hours.
11-04-2020T22:25:59,CrRAR,"Which I would think is probably generous, like lower load."
11-04-2020T22:26:18,Twokinds,That 2000 champion looks pretty good
11-04-2020T22:26:29,SpazztasticKiwi,amazon does have a compare option on-site
11-04-2020T22:26:42,xcvb,full load will go for 7-8h

11-04-2020T22:32:33,xcvb,costs way more than my car ;)
11-04-2020T22:32:43,CrRAR,Your car hopefully has more wheels tho ord
11-04-2020T22:33:06,ProsePro7,How much did your car cost?
11-04-2020T22:33:12,Ordithus,4.5 times as many!

11-04-2020T22:33:34,xcvb,i'll pay to take it away
11-04-2020T22:34:18,Dadrobit,I'm sure some of them very well may approach what I paid for my car lol.
11-04-2020T22:34:36,CrRAR,"Roll cheap, roll deep."
11-04-2020T22:35:03,CrRAR,"Srs, if you can keep something reliable, it really doesn’t matter"
11-04-2020T22:35:26,Ordithus,past me spent $$$ so now me has super cheap car
11-04-2020T22:35:37,Dadrobit,$3k. Managed to put another 50k miles on it so far with no problems beyond regular maintenance.
11-04-2020T22:35:50,Ordithus,nice
11-04-2020T22:36:05,CrRAR,Yes :ok_hand:
11-04-2020T22:36:12,Dadrobit,I don't currently see a woel where it doesn't reach at least 200k.

11-04-2020T22:36:35,Dadrobit,"Hi Tired, I'm Dad."
11-04-2020T22:36:44,SpazztasticKiwi,mostly of the weather alerts

11-04-2020T22:39:53,Dadrobit,"Yeah, 2006. SES, ZX3."
11-04-2020T22:40:07,Ordithus,that would make a sweet little autocross machine
11-04-2020T22:40:13,Dadrobit,Wanna turn it into a little rally car
11-04-2020T22:41:02,KeefMcDerpface,With all the rally parts or just bump up the ride hight?
11-04-2020T22:41:59,Dadrobit,I'd love to make it as propper rally as I could (while still being street legal).
11-04-2020T22:42:12,Dadrobit,(and keeping the AC)
11-04-2020T22:42:29,KeefMcDerpface,"Yes, the AC is very important."
11-04-2020T22:42:31,Ordithus,you and your AZ heat
11-04-2020T22:42:42,Dadrobit,"Exactly, fuck being in a metal box in 120F heat"
11-04-2020T22:43:17,KeefMcDerpface,I would like to do something like IRL (and a few other crazy builds).
11-04-2020T22:44:17,Dadrobit,Just a little front wheel rally car. We have a ton of great roads to get in trouble on in and around Payson/Flagstaff.

11-04-2020T22:48:28,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-shock: The mad lad.
11-04-2020T22:49:08,Ordithus,"on a serious note, cannot advise.  Seems a great way to both go blind and get some nice molten metal down your pant leg"
11-04-2020T22:49:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I see an osha book bursting into flames
11-04-2020T22:49:30,SpazztasticKiwi,and a lawsuit
11-04-2020T22:49:43,ProsePro7,This is why you get safety briefings
11-04-2020T22:49:45,SpazztasticKiwi,and one massive hospital bill

11-04-2020T22:51:12,Dadrobit,I can only imagine that he was just popping a few sparks for a split second for the picture.
11-04-2020T22:51:29,KeefMcDerpface,"Also, that's gonna give me nightmares."
11-04-2020T22:51:36,Dadrobit,It's French Officer Hopps.

11-04-2020T22:55:45,WINDOWS98SE,@Twokinds I was reading the specs of this one:  https://www.homedepot.com/p/Champion-Power-Equipment-Champion-2000-Watt-Parallel-Ready-Portable-Inverter-Generator-100565/306113176?MERCH=REC-_-rv_nav_plp_rr-_-NA-_-306113176-_-N
11-04-2020T22:55:56,WINDOWS98SE,Seems like it'd fit your needs.  Good fuel efficiency too.
11-04-2020T22:56:08,Ordithus,"granted, they're probably not touching their face with their feet, there"
11-04-2020T22:57:21,Twokinds,Not bad
11-04-2020T22:57:32,SpazztasticKiwi,might not get corona but there’s plenty else to catch walking through whatever’s been on the ground in public
11-04-2020T22:57:51,ProsePro7,Alright boys and girls I'm out.
11-04-2020T22:57:57,Ordithus,bye Prose
11-04-2020T22:58:00,KeefMcDerpface,Bye Prose
11-04-2020T22:58:03,Dadrobit,Going in tomorrow morning to see my doctor for an all-clear to go back to work myself.
11-04-2020T22:58:08,Dadrobit,o/ Prose
11-04-2020T22:58:13,ProsePro7,Apologies if I said anything across the line tonight.  I do that.
11-04-2020T22:58:23,Ordithus,"oh yeah!  You're alive, dadro! \o/"
11-04-2020T22:58:26,ProsePro7,See ya take care
11-04-2020T22:58:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"oh yeah, there’s notes that we’re getting paid for our screening time"
11-04-2020T22:58:34,Dadrobit,"This shit has sucked a fat one, glad to finally be getting over it."
11-04-2020T22:58:38,SpazztasticKiwi,including wait time in line
11-04-2020T22:59:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I have to guess this means there’s been a case close enough that they’ve decided to test everyone
11-04-2020T22:59:28,Dadrobit,"NGL, had a moment or two the last couple weeks where I wasn't exactly sure I was gonna make it. Lungs were 1000% shot to shit."
11-04-2020T22:59:43,Dadrobit,Now they're only like 45% shot to shit
11-04-2020T22:59:58,SpazztasticKiwi,you’re charging in reverse
11-04-2020T23:00:13,Ordithus,glad you made it!  Hope they're as good as ever soon enough
11-04-2020T23:00:20,Twokinds,That sounds really bad
11-04-2020T23:00:23,SpazztasticKiwi,do you think you had it?
11-04-2020T23:00:32,SpazztasticKiwi,or pneumonia
11-04-2020T23:00:37,Twokinds,I hope this virus stuff goes away
11-04-2020T23:01:03,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s been a few pneumonia cases taking hold of the elderly rn
11-04-2020T23:01:16,SpazztasticKiwi,so it’s definitely going around too
11-04-2020T23:01:43,Ordithus,I just hope all this isolation is working
11-04-2020T23:02:20,FenceEqualizer,Hopfully. Though it seems like we're going to be under lock down till pass may
11-04-2020T23:02:37,Dadrobit,"There's also a lot of ""pneumonia"" going around as well. One of my clients is a doctor and he was talking to me about it just before I came down myself. That because they're not testing everyone, people who die of Covid that weren't tested are just being"
11-04-2020T23:03:08,Dadrobit,listed under pneumonia and/or respiratory failure.
11-04-2020T23:03:33,Dadrobit,So we are absolutely under-reporting the actual casualty rate here. And that was weeks ago.
11-04-2020T23:03:52,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s showing that it is - we just have to make sure people don’t shoot out the gate like the Kentucky derby once they hear “lower reports”
11-04-2020T23:04:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"it’s the tests thing, there"
11-04-2020T23:04:42,SpazztasticKiwi,getting them around and used so we can actually know what we have has yet to happen
11-04-2020T23:05:10,Dadrobit,"It does not fuck around folks. Seriously, wash your damn hands and keep away from other people."
11-04-2020T23:05:30,FenceEqualizer,Easier said then done.
11-04-2020T23:05:44,FenceEqualizer,Idiots where throwing corona parties for a sec.
11-04-2020T23:05:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"with flu & pneumonia swimming around too, people want to believe corona is just a third of cases they hear of people being sick"
11-04-2020T23:06:19,SpazztasticKiwi,missing to point that those two can be lethal as well
11-04-2020T23:06:37,FenceEqualizer,"And people are ignoring it so much here in cali they're going to start fining people $1,000 if you're just out and about with friends."
11-04-2020T23:07:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I will report a miracle tho - new guy who I’ve been on with the washing of the hands has gotten a little firmer on the ball
11-04-2020T23:07:39,Dadrobit,"Fucking AZ Governor is a dipshit as well not helping anything. He made an emergency declaration saying that he was locking the state down. But, ya know, only a little. If you wanna go golfing with your buddies, that's fine too."
11-04-2020T23:07:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"the other day, I saw him wash up and refresh his gloves without a word"
11-04-2020T23:07:53,FenceEqualizer,Well that's one of the positives of this I suppose. It got some people to actually wash their hands
11-04-2020T23:07:57,Dadrobit,Like what's the point?!?!?
11-04-2020T23:08:08,FenceEqualizer,And you now...not attempt to drown the germs by using water only >.>
11-04-2020T23:08:29,FenceEqualizer,Yeah what the hell is that.
11-04-2020T23:08:34,CrRAR,That’s like the florida gov who was talking about letting kids go back to school
11-04-2020T23:08:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"some places effectively canceled easter while here it was considered ok, if not necessary"
11-04-2020T23:08:41,FenceEqualizer,That defeats the purpose of social distancing.
11-04-2020T23:08:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"like look, love Jesus but maybe this year let him sleep in"
11-04-2020T23:09:04,FenceEqualizer,America...is not handling this situation well.

11-04-2020T23:11:24,AspiringNoodle,Nice article if you want a play-by-play of PA / NJ :D
11-04-2020T23:11:58,Dadrobit,It certainly doesn't help that we have a decomposing jack-o-lantern sitting in as a president telling people that he wants everyone working again by easter...
11-04-2020T23:12:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’m not sure if I mentioned this but for those who know pokemon cake lady, she changed the date for this other cake she’s now ordered from us and she mad because she can’t have the party due to the new rules"
11-04-2020T23:12:20,SpazztasticKiwi,....decomposing jack o lantern...
11-04-2020T23:12:30,SpazztasticKiwi,you need to write some of these on cards
11-04-2020T23:12:56,Dadrobit,"TBF, that one was Jon Stewart"
11-04-2020T23:13:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m legit curious if he actually gets spray tans or if that’s an insult/rumor
11-04-2020T23:14:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I can’t tell
11-04-2020T23:15:24,Dadrobit,100% spray
11-04-2020T23:15:43,Dadrobit,You can see the changing of the spray lines around his eyes and along his hairline
11-04-2020T23:16:13,Dadrobit,"Not to mention the ever-changing tone that be blames on ""bad lighting"" that only seems to affect him."
11-04-2020T23:16:18,Dadrobit,that he*
11-04-2020T23:18:40,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s a shame because his normal skin tone looks perfectly fine
11-04-2020T23:23:26,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz: night
11-04-2020T23:23:31,Dadrobit,o/
11-04-2020T23:23:54,Dadrobit,"Without it, he just looks like an old lady white dude like the rest of em."
11-04-2020T23:24:02,Dadrobit,Old pasty*
11-04-2020T23:24:27,SpazztasticKiwi,old lady works too
11-04-2020T23:24:57,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe he just wanna stand out
11-04-2020T23:25:24,SpazztasticKiwi,like this lady https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/699101243657814017/image0.png
11-04-2020T23:25:28,AspiringNoodle,"Every time I see him, I can't help but think of Mr Garrison from south park, lol"
11-04-2020T23:25:42,SpazztasticKiwi,home full body face mask & gloves combo
11-04-2020T23:26:25,AspiringNoodle,"But yeah, people need to realize that this thing has an incubation period of up to 2 weeks"
11-04-2020T23:26:46,AspiringNoodle,"If we can go like 2 weeks with almost no new cases, then MAYBE we can consider removing all restrictions"
11-04-2020T23:27:49,Dadrobit,"Nah, then it just starts again. This thing is gonna hurt real bad the first time, then it's gonna come again and again in waves between isolation acts until we get a working vaccine."
11-04-2020T23:30:07,Dadrobit,"The world is just too globalized, and the absurdly long incubation period is gonna make this impossible to truly kill. Not without mass vaccines anyways."
11-04-2020T23:31:48,FenceEqualizer,The economy is going to get screwed in the end.
11-04-2020T23:34:31,AspiringNoodle,The only thing that could kill globalism
11-04-2020T23:34:41,AspiringNoodle,Ironically another virus :ptv-snicker:
11-04-2020T23:37:15,FenceEqualizer,We're living history in a crappy way. Another recession that's not going to stablize for some time. Hell it seems we won't even get a possible vaccine for at least a year from what i'm reading. This is not going away anytime soon
11-04-2020T23:37:43,FenceEqualizer,And we sadly have to buckle down until this storm passes
11-04-2020T23:42:23,AspiringNoodle,I hope this teaches the world a lesson
11-04-2020T23:42:32,AspiringNoodle,Do NOT rely on a single given country for something important
11-04-2020T23:42:46,AspiringNoodle,"If you can, produce it yourself."
11-04-2020T23:44:36,SpazztasticKiwi,lessons get taught but after awhile the experience fades
11-04-2020T23:44:46,SpazztasticKiwi,and it resets
11-04-2020T23:49:23,FenceEqualizer,History tends to repeat itself as they say...
11-04-2020T23:49:59,FenceEqualizer,Well enough Rona talk for me gonna head out. Have a good night everyone. :ptv-greetings:
11-04-2020T23:51:24,SpazztasticKiwi,weird thing about staying somewhere other than home: you hear a noise and the cat’s behind you looking for an invitation on the bed
11-04-2020T23:54:39,johnnytho,"As an introvert, rona hasn't changed my life. Itll get scary once police, or farmers start getting sick"
11-04-2020T23:55:04,johnnytho,Dont expect a vaccine anytime soon
11-04-2020T23:59:37,AspiringNoodle,I'm just enjoying working at a gas station
11-04-2020T23:59:57,AspiringNoodle,"And interacting with hundreds of people a day because what's a ""stay-at-home"" order?"
11-04-2020T23:59:58,AspiringNoodle,:P
