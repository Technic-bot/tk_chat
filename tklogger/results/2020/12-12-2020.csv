12-12-2020T00:00:28,CrRAR,honestly though kids be lucky with the internet these days
12-12-2020T00:00:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"if there’s any kind of warning to give, it’s don’t put them in your wallet"
12-12-2020T00:01:01,SpazztasticKiwi,stock them like toilet paper but don’t put them in your wallet
12-12-2020T00:01:30,SpazztasticKiwi,and double wrapping isn’t double safe
12-12-2020T00:02:01,CrRAR,Such bad urban legends or just stupid teen rumors
12-12-2020T00:02:25,CrRAR,Some of that crap probably started as jokes
12-12-2020T00:02:50,SpazztasticKiwi,double wrapping gives more friction for breakage or slipping off
12-12-2020T00:03:36,CrRAR,Yeah basically like you’d never want tostick cling wrap to cling wrap
12-12-2020T00:03:48,CrRAR,gonna have a bad time
12-12-2020T00:04:11,CrRAR,...just like slippery clingwrap
12-12-2020T00:04:18,CrRAR,xD
12-12-2020T00:04:23,SpazztasticKiwi,& keeping them in your wallet wears them down quicker
12-12-2020T00:04:50,SpazztasticKiwi,constant rubbing as they sit in the packet
12-12-2020T00:04:51,CrRAR,Yeah the squishy and the torsion and just the warmth be bad
12-12-2020T00:05:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I learned awhile ago they recommended throwing out any that had been in the wallet for over three months because they’d already degraded enough to risk significant breakage by then regardless of expiration
12-12-2020T00:06:11,SpazztasticKiwi,they’re good for waterproofing your phone
12-12-2020T00:06:20,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s all I’m concerned with
12-12-2020T00:06:41,CrRAR,"In a cinch, but also ew haha"
12-12-2020T00:06:50,SpazztasticKiwi,ew what
12-12-2020T00:07:02,CrRAR,Just use like a produce baggie or somethin
12-12-2020T00:07:25,SpazztasticKiwi,they tear easy
12-12-2020T00:07:54,CrRAR,"Alright, allllright, quality life hack"
12-12-2020T00:08:00,CrRAR,:ok_hand:
12-12-2020T00:08:28,SpazztasticKiwi,the health clinic gives them out with your appointment baggie when you leav
12-12-2020T00:08:50,SpazztasticKiwi,may as well use em for something
12-12-2020T00:09:35,CrRAR,"Oh yeah, bowls of em in the weirdest places on college campuses"
12-12-2020T00:09:55,SpazztasticKiwi,PLEASE take one
12-12-2020T00:10:07,CrRAR,"Yeapp, the days of sexual health bein stigmatized are largely over"
12-12-2020T00:10:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"my thing is, there’s always gonna be one that’s gonna be like “it won’t hurt this one time”"
12-12-2020T00:11:16,SpazztasticKiwi,no
12-12-2020T00:11:25,SpazztasticKiwi,don’t be silly wrap your willie
12-12-2020T00:12:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"when you break down conception, it sound real hard for the two to meet but it’s very much not"
12-12-2020T00:12:49,Ordithus,life uh... finds a way
12-12-2020T00:13:10,SpazztasticKiwi,oh did you see the story of the man who’s cat caused his recent child to take root
12-12-2020T00:13:38,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-VivianPanic:
12-12-2020T00:13:47,CrRAR,"Uhh, yeah... not when literally the result of evolution is to be most efficent at it"
12-12-2020T00:14:16,SpazztasticKiwi,his cat got into the drawer after the qtips cause he likes to chew on them and ended up stabbing his claws in some of the packets
12-12-2020T00:14:26,SpazztasticKiwi,dude put them all back without checking them
12-12-2020T00:14:27,CrRAR,Ah
12-12-2020T00:14:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"boom, baby"
12-12-2020T00:14:35,CrRAR,blasted cat
12-12-2020T00:15:11,Ordithus,cat wanted more scritches and more humans to sit on
12-12-2020T00:15:20,CrRAR,I can’t imagine the foils wouldn’t look messed up
12-12-2020T00:15:51,Ordithus,"cats are balls of fuzz with needles, might not have noticed"
12-12-2020T00:16:24,CrRAR,for... reasons
12-12-2020T00:16:24,SpazztasticKiwi,he admitted he wasn’t paying attention & didn’t put two and two together
12-12-2020T00:17:05,SpazztasticKiwi,cat after qtips = condoms are uneffected and thus out of consideration
12-12-2020T00:17:41,Ordithus,"just remember, you are in an unbroken line of reproduction from the first single celled life, all the way down to your parents :cw0lfmare-Paperflora:"
12-12-2020T00:18:05,SpazztasticKiwi,always check your inventory before conducting business
12-12-2020T00:19:43,CrRAR,tbh that cat has some weird co-morbid hobbies
12-12-2020T00:19:57,CrRAR,lil freak
12-12-2020T00:20:42,CrRAR,Time to put a lock on that drawer
12-12-2020T00:22:19,SpazztasticKiwi,or use a different drawer
12-12-2020T00:23:23,CrRAR,“Ah this one with the kebab skewers!”
12-12-2020T00:23:35,CrRAR,“He’ll never go in there!”
12-12-2020T00:23:55,SpazztasticKiwi,you completely missed the opportunity to say the knife drawer
12-12-2020T00:24:03,CrRAR,I was gonna
12-12-2020T00:24:15,CrRAR,Those are beside the skewers
12-12-2020T00:24:37,Ordithus,:smirk_cat::knife:
12-12-2020T00:24:57,CrRAR,damn cat
12-12-2020T00:25:27,CrRAR,skewers just seemed more pokey household object

12-12-2020T16:20:45,Ordithus,yeah it's a nice scent
12-12-2020T16:21:13,ThingsAreMoving,You can buy spruce scented essential oils to kinda sorta make it believable
12-12-2020T16:21:19,Ordithus,I don't have room for a real tree!
12-12-2020T16:21:26,ThingsAreMoving,"but yeah, the real thing smells awesome"
12-12-2020T16:21:32,ProsePro7,I have a candle

12-12-2020T16:21:53,Ordithus,"Wouldn't even be a waste to have a real tree, I'd use it as firewood after"
12-12-2020T16:21:54,ThingsAreMoving,Are bonsai pine trees a thing?
12-12-2020T16:22:00,ThingsAreMoving,I could get one for next year

12-12-2020T16:22:23,ProsePro7,They have mini pines
12-12-2020T16:22:47,NezumiYuki,"That's a very good question, Things... No clue. But if there were such things as mini Bonsai Pines, those would sell like hotcakes this season!"
12-12-2020T16:23:10,ProsePro7,I would love to see the light string and ornaments for them
12-12-2020T16:23:12,ThingsAreMoving,Might be a new year's resolution. Get a bonsai pine tree and don't let it die.

12-12-2020T16:24:39,ProsePro7,And read Jaws before that/  The movies are very different
12-12-2020T16:24:41,Ordithus,"I read that many years ago, was not ready for how different it was from the movie"
12-12-2020T16:24:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Best book outside of lord of the rings and eaters of the dead
12-12-2020T16:25:02,ProsePro7,Eaters of the Dead?
12-12-2020T16:25:02,Ordithus,same with The Shining. Very different
12-12-2020T16:25:37,Folfy,I mean with a book its more open and can be longer. With a movie it has to be shorter and keep the audience interested.
12-12-2020T16:25:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Michael Crichton book, the movie 13th warrior is based on it"
12-12-2020T16:26:07,ProsePro7,Oh.  I thought they based that on Beowolf
12-12-2020T16:27:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I think there are hints of beowolf in it.  But for the most part its just Vikings and a Arab protecting a village from a cannibalistic tribe
12-12-2020T16:27:44,ProsePro7,Cool.  Ill look it up.  Gonna read Nothing Lasts forever next.  Its the book Die Hard is based off of
12-12-2020T16:28:22,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s like the chat topic went running across a wet tile floor
12-12-2020T16:28:22,NezumiYuki,Speaking of DieHard... Gotta watch that awesome christmas movie this year!
12-12-2020T16:28:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Noice

12-12-2020T16:28:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Yes
12-12-2020T16:28:35,Ordithus,Yes
12-12-2020T16:28:42,ProsePro7,Yes Die Hard is Christmas Classic
12-12-2020T16:28:43,ThingsAreMoving,Yep
12-12-2020T16:29:10,ProsePro7,Thats why Im reading the prequel before I read it on Christmas
12-12-2020T16:29:14,ThingsAreMoving,"Although for my country, Home Alone is the christmas staple."
12-12-2020T16:29:18,TheSexyBeast,"Never thought of it before, but I guess it is."
12-12-2020T16:29:26,SpazztasticKiwi,🌯
12-12-2020T16:29:27,Ordithus,"another Christmas movie, things!"
12-12-2020T16:29:29,NezumiYuki,Home alone is hilarious!
12-12-2020T16:29:37,SpazztasticKiwi,don’t mind me
12-12-2020T16:29:49,ProsePro7,As long as they dont play A Christmas Story I'm good
12-12-2020T16:29:51,NezumiYuki,The only NOT so hilarious part is when Mr Grump makes his cameo
12-12-2020T16:30:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m watching the preentertainment while I stuff my face
12-12-2020T16:30:42,ThingsAreMoving,What's the stuffing?
12-12-2020T16:30:45,TheSexyBeast,"Christmas Story, Christmas Vacation, Elf.."
12-12-2020T16:30:59,TheSexyBeast,The Santa Clause
12-12-2020T16:31:13,ProsePro7,The best and most annoying Christmas movies ever
12-12-2020T16:32:00,TheSexyBeast,Polar Express?
12-12-2020T16:32:18,ProsePro7,Havent seen it
12-12-2020T16:33:09,TheSexyBeast,Santa Claus vs. the Martians
12-12-2020T16:33:23,NezumiYuki,omg that is a bad classic!
12-12-2020T16:33:26,Ordithus,I've seen (heard) A Christmas Story enough times for 10 lifetimes
12-12-2020T16:33:36,InTheLionsDen,I'll just stick with the 20 min animated Grinch.
12-12-2020T16:33:36,NezumiYuki,A so bad it's GOOD classic
12-12-2020T16:33:38,ProsePro7,....I would say thats not a real movie but I know HollyWood too well to know better
12-12-2020T16:34:03,SpazztasticKiwi,cats trying to sneak my extra burrito
12-12-2020T16:34:13,NezumiYuki,Aww  xD
12-12-2020T16:34:25,InTheLionsDen,If it is in their domain it is theirs.
12-12-2020T16:34:25,TheSexyBeast,Purrito?
12-12-2020T16:34:32,ProsePro7,Muppet Familiy Christmas anyone?

12-12-2020T16:34:50,NezumiYuki,I got it !!!
12-12-2020T16:35:05,Ordithus,a purrito is a cat wrapped in a blanket until harmless
12-12-2020T16:35:13,ThingsAreMoving,comfy*
12-12-2020T16:35:19,NezumiYuki,A StarWars Christmas Special !!!  The one thing George would like everyone to forget... but the Internet never forgets !
12-12-2020T16:35:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I gib him snackies to distract
12-12-2020T16:35:42,ProsePro7,I think George would like to forget a few other things now Nezu
12-12-2020T16:35:52,NezumiYuki,true tho Prose
12-12-2020T16:36:10,ThingsAreMoving,Would he actually nom the burrito or is he just curious about it
12-12-2020T16:36:43,ProsePro7,But one good thing about that special...Bea Arthur
12-12-2020T16:36:43,SpazztasticKiwi,he’d try a bite
12-12-2020T16:36:45,NezumiYuki,well if there's enough beef in that burrit... kitty would most certainly be interested in it!
12-12-2020T16:36:45,BluePhantom90,God I love the Artic Wolf and Northern Basitin couple. Tom you did a fantastic job. But I have created a new project with idea's of how they met and more.
12-12-2020T16:37:04,SpazztasticKiwi,this cat swallows then tastes it later
12-12-2020T16:37:06,BluePhantom90,people will suggest
12-12-2020T16:37:12,ProsePro7,I dont remember that one Blue.  Got the link?
12-12-2020T16:37:23,ThingsAreMoving,"The latest sketch, Prose"
12-12-2020T16:37:31,SpazztasticKiwi,kitty is not getting seasoned beef
12-12-2020T16:37:42,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s no telling what exactly is in it
12-12-2020T16:37:44,ProsePro7,Kitty will become seasoned beef

12-12-2020T16:39:32,BluePhantom90,"heh I have created a monster of everyone now wanting to know ""How they met"" lol"
12-12-2020T16:39:36,NezumiYuki,How often does Tom do mondays?
12-12-2020T16:39:44,BluePhantom90,Just like the Snow Leopard Village
12-12-2020T16:39:46,ProsePro7,Usually when he cant finish Sunday
12-12-2020T16:40:06,BluePhantom90,just a continue of Sunday if it gets too late
12-12-2020T16:40:12,ProsePro7,Speaking of I was wrong looks like it will be 5:00 pm my guess now
12-12-2020T16:40:37,NezumiYuki,Tom Time is always when he wishes it to be~
12-12-2020T16:42:27,Combak,"Hey all! Sketch stream should start in a little bit, right?"

12-12-2020T16:42:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom time has no definition
12-12-2020T16:43:12,ThingsAreMoving,"We have no official info, but Tom is here and he's trying to understand what some of the suggestions actually mean"
12-12-2020T16:43:23,Ordithus,"hi combak, crimson"

12-12-2020T16:43:52,ProsePro7,You think he would be used to us super freaks by now
12-12-2020T16:44:28,Combak,"Hi Marv, Things, Ord."
12-12-2020T16:44:41,Combak,That's good to read then.
12-12-2020T16:44:48,ThingsAreMoving,Sometimes deciphering sentences is pretty hard
12-12-2020T16:44:52,InTheLionsDen,He was also indicating one that called for half the cast to be drawn.
12-12-2020T16:44:55,ThingsAreMoving,"like with this one: ""Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?"""
12-12-2020T16:45:03,ProsePro7,That worries me for our culture

12-12-2020T16:46:17,ProsePro7,If its broken english that you cant read then I smell bots
12-12-2020T16:46:53,ThingsAreMoving,"Naaaah, some people's english is pretty broken"
12-12-2020T16:47:01,ThingsAreMoving,Remember James the squirrel man?
12-12-2020T16:47:01,CrRAR,"if the bots smell, are they really bots?"
12-12-2020T16:47:14,Ordithus,I think James used google translate or something
12-12-2020T16:47:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I miss him
12-12-2020T16:47:41,Avolendi,"Maybe make some auto reply along the lines of ""can't read, please check with other people to properly write it out"""
12-12-2020T16:47:42,CrRAR,haha
12-12-2020T16:47:46,Ordithus,Maybe multiple times
12-12-2020T16:47:53,TheSexyBeast,Do people still flip out over someone's preference in a partner/s?
12-12-2020T16:47:55,ThingsAreMoving,"Well, I remember him sayinn he lives in the UK"
12-12-2020T16:47:57,ProsePro7,Best way to uses Google Translate is one sentence at a time any more and you confuse it
12-12-2020T16:48:10,ThingsAreMoving,So maybe he was actually trying
12-12-2020T16:48:16,ThingsAreMoving,but alas we'll never know
12-12-2020T16:48:20,Ordithus,"Like, how Star Wars the Third Gathers: Backstroke of the West was made"

12-12-2020T16:48:45,CrRAR,was that the translation of a title?
12-12-2020T16:48:47,ThingsAreMoving,that kills the script
12-12-2020T16:48:57,Ordithus,A really hilarious pirated translation of a translation of Star Wars 3
12-12-2020T16:49:02,Ordithus,The entire thing is on youtube

12-12-2020T20:01:56,BadFoMo,Yo.
12-12-2020T20:01:57,Twokinds,The poll is random. Or as random as it can be. It's always shuffled before being split in 4.
12-12-2020T20:02:03,Ordithus,hi BAD
12-12-2020T20:02:05,Folfy,Hey BAD
12-12-2020T20:02:10,Twokinds,But there's only 4 slots. So there's a 25% chance of it being in any given slot.
12-12-2020T20:02:21,Dragusthor,hi BAD

12-12-2020T20:02:36,Ordithus,a coin landing heads 10 times in a row can be random. probability is weird
12-12-2020T20:02:44,ProsePro7,I guess I saw a pattern where there was none
12-12-2020T20:03:04,Twokinds,"Human nature finds patterns in anything, even random noise."

12-12-2020T20:03:29,Twokinds,"But when you submit it makes no difference, before it doesn't even get submitted into the polling software in that order."
12-12-2020T20:03:32,ProsePro7,My pattern is a really weird  one though

12-12-2020T22:52:15,BADBackgroundProductions,How long was it between when Trace and Flora first met and when they pronounced themselves lovers?
12-12-2020T22:52:17,Roughlandin,Laura makes it work.
12-12-2020T22:52:19,NezumiYuki,"True Steel, smol tiger is cute tiger too"
12-12-2020T22:52:58,Roughlandin,Not long BAD lol. It's not even been a full year in comic time
12-12-2020T22:53:13,ShamusTheFox,Laura absolutely makes it work
12-12-2020T22:53:22,Roughlandin,Yis she do. Woof

12-12-2020T22:54:45,ThingsAreMoving,Flora's eyes look like some cyber implants. As if she's unleashing a torrent of hacks on the player.

12-12-2020T22:56:12,KeefMcDerpface,"OMG, Kat's eyes."
12-12-2020T22:56:24,Roughlandin,Still waiting for that GPU upgrade. Probably gonna be waiting a while lol
12-12-2020T22:56:27,ThingsAreMoving,my gtx 1070 allows me to run 1080p on medium-high
12-12-2020T22:56:27,LunarSpy,"Damn, nailing these expression!"
12-12-2020T22:56:37,Roughlandin,Tom is king of expressions
12-12-2020T22:56:38,steelabjur,"lol, Rough, my Titan Black wasn't super happy either until the latest patch."
12-12-2020T22:56:42,ThingsAreMoving,still clocked in 50+ hours in Cyberpunk already xD
12-12-2020T22:56:44,LunarSpy,Oh hoo?
12-12-2020T22:56:48,Ordithus,supposedly my computer actually exceeds the minimum requirements!
12-12-2020T22:56:55,Roughlandin,Same
12-12-2020T22:56:58,LunarSpy,"Finally, A worthy challenge~"
12-12-2020T22:57:03,steelabjur,Likewise.
12-12-2020T22:57:10,Roughlandin,But I get some serious frame drops in effect heavy areas
12-12-2020T22:57:15,LunarSpy,Expressions are my JAM! I have too much fun drawing them
12-12-2020T22:57:20,NezumiYuki,Ya know... We all need some of Laura Tech Tips TKX 3090 cards... Preferably ones Laura has NOT cleaned yet.   xD
12-12-2020T22:57:29,BADBackgroundProductions,Flora: You call these FLAT?! *rips open shirt in the middle of school”
12-12-2020T22:57:33,KeefMcDerpface,Yeah...
12-12-2020T22:57:39,Roughlandin,Might also be because apparently there's a bugged line of code that affects AMD CPU performance
12-12-2020T22:57:53,KeefMcDerpface,Well that's just great.
12-12-2020T22:57:58,CrRAR,Just one line?
12-12-2020T22:57:59,Ordithus,ooh that would be problematic for me
12-12-2020T22:58:01,Ordithus,FX8370
12-12-2020T22:58:13,Roughlandin,AMDs don't multithread right. Should be an easy fix once they get to it
12-12-2020T22:58:29,Roughlandin,Apparently you can alter it yourself and get major performance boosts
12-12-2020T22:58:35,steelabjur,I've supposedly put in 26.1 hours according to Steam (it's actually more).
12-12-2020T22:58:44,ThingsAreMoving,"That would explain a lot,,, Rough."
12-12-2020T22:59:25,Roughlandin,Yep. My 3600 is gonna be glad when they fix it
12-12-2020T23:00:21,steelabjur,"Flora has murder in her eyes, gonna make it one less Human at the boarding school!"
12-12-2020T23:00:25,BADBackgroundProductions,"... not gonna lie, I’m completely lost in this conversation"
12-12-2020T23:00:34,KeefMcDerpface,Welcome to chat.

12-12-2020T23:01:32,CrRAR,Ahhh
12-12-2020T23:01:32,steelabjur,"@BADBackgroundProductions talking about Cyberpunk 2077, a game which came out a couple days ago with some bugs."
12-12-2020T23:01:34,Roughlandin,Have nice noms Kat
12-12-2020T23:02:03,NezumiYuki,Cyberpunk... is that the Keanu Reeves game?
12-12-2020T23:02:07,KeefMcDerpface,yes
12-12-2020T23:02:10,steelabjur,Yep.
12-12-2020T23:02:19,Roughlandin,Apparently CNN thinks he's the main character
12-12-2020T23:02:25,KeefMcDerpface,pffft
12-12-2020T23:02:26,KeefMcDerpface,wat
12-12-2020T23:02:32,Roughlandin,*Shrugs*
12-12-2020T23:02:45,Dragusthor,what do you think?
12-12-2020T23:02:46,Roughlandin,Obligatory the news doesn't get video games
12-12-2020T23:02:53,Dragusthor,Cyberpunk 2077
12-12-2020T23:03:03,steelabjur,He plays a major character from the history of the universe that I won't spoil.
12-12-2020T23:03:30,Roughlandin,I like the gameplay. Gonna wait till they iron out some more of the bugs though
12-12-2020T23:03:44,BADBackgroundProductions,Isn’t there I’m huge controversy overall the fact that The Last of Us Two Won a bunch of awards?
12-12-2020T23:03:56,BADBackgroundProductions,Stupid autocorrect
12-12-2020T23:04:17,ThingsAreMoving,I liked the story more than the gameplay tbh
12-12-2020T23:04:22,Ordithus,Laura be in the back like :ctwokinds-laura::popcorn:
12-12-2020T23:04:28,KeefMcDerpface,lol
12-12-2020T23:04:36,Roughlandin,"Something to do with a terrible crunch for the dev team, BAD"
12-12-2020T23:04:53,steelabjur,"I like the hacking elements, causing enemies to burst into flames because their cyberware overheats never gets old."
12-12-2020T23:04:55,ThingsAreMoving,"gunplay is unrewarding, cars feel stiff, perk system is mostly %increase to some stats"
12-12-2020T23:05:02,NezumiYuki,Laura... now now... don't encourage the Tiger to let the rage flow....
12-12-2020T23:05:10,ThingsAreMoving,"But the story, soundtrack and the sheer scope of stuff to do in this game"
12-12-2020T23:05:18,ThingsAreMoving,Is more than enough to make me happy
12-12-2020T23:05:48,Roughlandin,Yeah the story is neat. Getting to play a corporate bigwig at the start of one path is an interesting twist
12-12-2020T23:06:03,Rulo6000,lol flat cat
12-12-2020T23:06:10,Roughlandin,Haven't tried the other paths yet
12-12-2020T23:06:10,CrRAR,I feel like rpgs get away with kinda kludgy mechanics
12-12-2020T23:06:19,steelabjur,@ThingsAreMoving try getting your hands on a bike. Stole a Tyger ganger's bike and never wanted to give it up because it felt so much better to drive.
12-12-2020T23:06:22,ThingsAreMoving,"My first playthrough was with a street kid, neuromancer/techie with some stealth"
12-12-2020T23:06:30,CrRAR,But maybe they can polish it up more
12-12-2020T23:06:35,ThingsAreMoving,my second is focused on body/reflex with shotguns
12-12-2020T23:06:44,Roughlandin,It reminds me of Fallout New Vegas. Gameplay is kinda clunky but the story is really good
12-12-2020T23:06:50,CrRAR,^
12-12-2020T23:06:56,CrRAR,Exactly my thought
12-12-2020T23:07:04,CrRAR,Like fallout
12-12-2020T23:07:08,steelabjur,Exactly the same thought Rough.
12-12-2020T23:07:08,ThingsAreMoving,Leave it to the Poles to polish it up
12-12-2020T23:07:15,ThingsAreMoving,:ctwokinds-smug:
12-12-2020T23:07:25,steelabjur,rofl Things. :p
12-12-2020T23:07:35,Roughlandin,Witcher 3 beats it in overall fun factor though
12-12-2020T23:07:44,Roughlandin,And sheer size too I think
12-12-2020T23:07:58,steelabjur,"Witcher 3 had a rough launch too, IIRC."
12-12-2020T23:08:00,FenceEqualizer,Depends on the type of genre you like
12-12-2020T23:08:12,Roughlandin,I finally beat W3 a few weeks ago
12-12-2020T23:08:19,KeefMcDerpface,\o/
12-12-2020T23:08:22,Roughlandin,Even though I've started playing it like 4 times
12-12-2020T23:08:47,KeefMcDerpface,Started 4 times but finished once?
12-12-2020T23:08:49,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,I can see Flora using a Steamroller to flatten the main character in revenge
12-12-2020T23:08:49,Roughlandin,"I kept putting it down, losing track of where I was, and restarting the game"
12-12-2020T23:09:05,steelabjur,"Oooh, Miss Flora gonna give us a show before murderin' us, it looks like!"
12-12-2020T23:09:08,Roughlandin,I finally got time this year to sit down and play the whole thing through
12-12-2020T23:09:13,ProsePro7,Working on Valhalla right now
12-12-2020T23:09:34,Roughlandin,I kinda fell out of Assassin's Creed after Black Flag
