28-08-2020T01:03:13,steelabjur,Stupid sexy evil Clovis!
28-08-2020T01:03:15,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
28-08-2020T01:03:16,Dadrobit,Turning in early. Got something planned for tomorrow?
28-08-2020T01:03:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Thanks for the stramboli
28-08-2020T01:03:25,w0lfmare,Good work Tom!
28-08-2020T01:03:29,CrRAR,clovis returns/10
28-08-2020T01:03:32,LogicIsHere,And then there was Clovis
28-08-2020T01:03:37,Ordithus,thanks for doing the comic thing
28-08-2020T01:03:48,Twokinds,I'll be back tomorrow for the backgrounds
28-08-2020T01:03:52,CrRAR,oo very sinister glowy
28-08-2020T01:03:53,FenceEqualizer,Thanks for streaming Tom. Also why does the toering actually work on him?
28-08-2020T01:03:58,steelabjur,"Thanks for the stream, see you tomorrow if that materializes!"
28-08-2020T01:03:59,BADBackgroundProductions,What time?
28-08-2020T01:04:06,Twokinds,"Well he is ""royalty"""
28-08-2020T01:04:11,Dadrobit,"Because fashion, Fence."
28-08-2020T01:04:21,LogicIsHere,I'm surprised he ain't got Tailrings
28-08-2020T01:04:25,Ordithus,because he's got the looks
28-08-2020T01:04:37,FenceEqualizer,False Royalty! I don't see lamenated papers!
28-08-2020T01:04:48,steelabjur,He's rocking a Prince Albert though. :p
28-08-2020T01:05:03,BADBackgroundProductions,"Man, seeing the end credits still going shows just how much work was put in this game.."
28-08-2020T01:05:04,AspiringNoodle,This page gonna look so cool
28-08-2020T01:05:05,BadFoMo,Why doesn't Clovis have shoes for Keidran?
28-08-2020T01:05:06,LogicIsHere,Imagine someone with so many piercings that they basically have improvised chainmail armor XD
28-08-2020T01:05:25,FenceEqualizer,That sounds dangerous as heck.
28-08-2020T01:05:25,CrRAR,:ptv-confused:
28-08-2020T01:05:38,Ordithus,"Also, welcome Clovis, to the main comic!"
28-08-2020T01:05:39,w0lfmare,"Well to be fair, what makes anyone a king/prince?"
28-08-2020T01:05:40,Twokinds,I wonder if piercing would be hard to maintain in a world with healing magic constantly sealing up the holes.
28-08-2020T01:05:41,FenceEqualizer,Like you're full on at a disadvantage.
28-08-2020T01:05:56,AspiringNoodle,Easy
28-08-2020T01:05:59,CrRAR,oh dang
28-08-2020T01:06:03,Dadrobit,"I got it steel, no worries."
28-08-2020T01:06:06,AspiringNoodle,"Make hole, put jewelry in hole, have hole healed"
28-08-2020T01:06:08,steelabjur,"Reminds me of a guy I used to work with, he was a professional tattoo artist and did piercings too."
28-08-2020T01:06:11,AspiringNoodle,Jewelry is now one with the body @w@
28-08-2020T01:06:17,LogicIsHere,You could use magic to set the piercing as a perminant feature of your body so it just heals that way? o.o
28-08-2020T01:06:29,Twokinds,shrug
28-08-2020T01:06:29,BadFoMo,...Wait for the skin to heal with the hole intact?
28-08-2020T01:06:34,Dadrobit,I was figuring more of a Jacobs ladder of rings that he could disguise it in.
28-08-2020T01:06:39,Twokinds,"Alright, goodnight everybody!"
28-08-2020T01:06:43,LogicIsHere,Night Tom
28-08-2020T01:06:46,CrRAR,haha
28-08-2020T01:06:46,Ordithus,night Tom!
28-08-2020T01:06:52,FenceEqualizer,Depends on the healing magic? Like since something is blocking the way it would stop the skin from fully recovering. ALso goodnight
28-08-2020T01:06:52,BadFoMo,Good night.
28-08-2020T01:06:53,CrRAR,#justbedtimethoughts
28-08-2020T01:06:54,BADBackgroundProductions,"Wait, isn’t it your comic? Doesn’t that mean the ring things up to you?"
28-08-2020T01:06:59,AspiringNoodle,Here's a disturbing thought...
28-08-2020T01:07:06,FenceEqualizer,Why they still have doctors in fantasy settings.
28-08-2020T01:07:06,w0lfmare,Night Tom!

28-08-2020T01:07:11,AspiringNoodle,Imagine trying to have piercings in such in a world where bodies are constantly breaking down
28-08-2020T01:07:28,AspiringNoodle,This has been your nightmare fuel for the evening

28-08-2020T15:06:08,SpazztasticKiwi,that was for crrar

28-08-2020T15:10:05,SageSaga,i am terrified though of people considering Chivalry to be when you use lube rather than when you do not
28-08-2020T15:10:13,SpazztasticKiwi,storm waves that Laura is sending to the places outside her path
28-08-2020T15:10:37,SpazztasticKiwi,the forecast map is......suggestive

28-08-2020T15:12:26,SpazztasticKiwi,so it wouldn’t be too wrong to call these storms keith
28-08-2020T15:12:44,SageSaga,it would be wrong to call them that
28-08-2020T15:13:01,SageSaga,because we name storms to show how threatening they are - you cant just name every storm-

28-08-2020T16:34:25,SageSaga,its important to remember- most people in the US - dont vote
28-08-2020T16:34:44,CrRAR,"mmm, even in local type vote situations it's like 10%"
28-08-2020T16:34:56,CrRAR,at best I'm pretty sure
28-08-2020T16:35:26,CrRAR,maybe more on a nat'l level
28-08-2020T16:35:32,SageSaga,on average maybe- theres a lot of counties where its like 5-10% of the county
28-08-2020T16:35:45,CrRAR,ah okay
28-08-2020T16:35:59,SageSaga,but in bigger elections i think its closer to 40%
28-08-2020T16:36:18,hyneria,I just reemember reading presidents almosta always win when they have a reelection bid
28-08-2020T16:36:26,CrRAR,"that seems right, things of national visibility should get people out there"
28-08-2020T16:36:31,SageSaga,yep its around 40%
28-08-2020T16:36:46,SageSaga,though recently we have seen much much higher turnout
28-08-2020T16:36:52,SageSaga,which is scaring the republicans
28-08-2020T16:36:59,CrRAR,mmm
28-08-2020T16:37:07,SageSaga,"they keep saying this - ""The more people that vote- the more likely the Democrats win"""
28-08-2020T16:37:10,CrRAR,Also remember America IS 4 years older now
28-08-2020T16:37:15,SageSaga,which is REEEEALLY telling
28-08-2020T16:37:30,CrRAR,Bernie said that a whole lot too
28-08-2020T16:37:47,SageSaga,because Bernie does this weird thing
28-08-2020T16:37:55,SageSaga,he bases what he says on studies and facts
28-08-2020T16:37:59,SageSaga,it's crazy
28-08-2020T16:38:02,CrRAR,hahaha
28-08-2020T16:38:33,TeapotOfDoom,Destroy them with facts and logic
28-08-2020T16:39:19,SageSaga,every biden quote on this propaganda is taken out of context
28-08-2020T16:39:47,TeapotOfDoom,that's the best context
28-08-2020T16:39:50,TeapotOfDoom,no context
28-08-2020T16:39:59,CrRAR,"Yeah it's only feeding his ravenous followers, the reast probably have stopped listening hopefully"
28-08-2020T16:41:46,CrRAR,:eyes:
28-08-2020T16:41:49,CrRAR,"such a nice door, such a shame"
28-08-2020T16:42:43,InTheLionsDen,"When it explodes in another one slides out of the wall, taking it's place."
28-08-2020T16:43:17,InTheLionsDen,Even stronger and fancier.
28-08-2020T16:43:56,SageSaga,"""When Biden was asked if he would redirect funding away from police he said ""yes! Absolutely!"" - thing is - they were discussing if they were able to direct those funds into other police related and things that would help relieve the work the police have"
28-08-2020T16:43:57,SageSaga,to do
28-08-2020T16:44:47,CrRAR,"Yeah I read that bit, Biden was interviewing with an enthusiastic defund person and his explanation was much longer that was led to be believed"
28-08-2020T16:46:01,SageSaga,"Biden's stance has been ""I dont want to defund the police- but we should look into how to make our police better and take the load off their shoulders and support body cameras"""
28-08-2020T16:46:33,SageSaga,because body cameras work surprisingly well
28-08-2020T16:46:51,SageSaga,its almost like evidence is helpful or something when determining if laws were broken
28-08-2020T16:47:42,CrRAR,yeah good cops will always be good it will at least hopefully change the bad ones' behavior
28-08-2020T16:48:17,CrRAR,Like the idea that you got nothing to hide if you're honest or whatever
28-08-2020T16:48:20,SageSaga,the number of bad cops caught by these cameras is great too- remember that video of the guy planting drugs thinking he had tricked his camera?
28-08-2020T16:48:58,CrRAR,"it is a pain for the otherwise good ones, but it's moso just equal punishment kinda, like how the military punishes all for the failures of one"
28-08-2020T16:49:32,SageSaga,how is it a pain?
28-08-2020T16:49:42,CrRAR,Should incentivze it so that the good ones push the immoral ones out
28-08-2020T16:49:45,CrRAR,ah
28-08-2020T16:49:45,w0lfmare,Shouldn'r make much difference to good cops
28-08-2020T16:50:06,CrRAR,"No, yeah it's should be seamless to the good ones"
28-08-2020T16:50:22,CrRAR,Once they get used to them
28-08-2020T16:50:38,CrRAR,I think of it more as the hassle of more technology
28-08-2020T16:50:40,w0lfmare,"Probably even better for them, since it's court evidence"
28-08-2020T16:50:45,CrRAR,yup
28-08-2020T16:50:46,SageSaga,even police generally love the cameras
28-08-2020T16:50:51,CrRAR,backs them when they need it
28-08-2020T16:52:28,SageSaga,now I know body cameras havent reduced police brutality - but they do provide evidence of which cops are bad - so if we could fix that part- that'd be greeeeeat
28-08-2020T16:53:06,CrimsonHelsing,Ooh more stream
28-08-2020T16:53:23,CrRAR,yup
28-08-2020T16:59:25,CrimsonHelsing,"Really tho, Tom, considering what you said the other night... WHY are the estate's defenses attacking the wrong people??? I mean, really, blue on blue!"
28-08-2020T17:00:22,QuinnMalachite,Why indeed
28-08-2020T17:01:13,Twokinds,Guess you'll have to find out
28-08-2020T17:02:15,CrimsonHelsing,Oh
28-08-2020T17:02:32,CrimsonHelsing,Either way I hope that can be fixed soon

28-08-2020T17:04:39,MoonDance,I've heard people suggest to automatically charge police who turn off their cams
28-08-2020T17:05:57,Twokinds,This was my first hint about rose
28-08-2020T17:06:24,TeapotOfDoom,well i mean considering what we know
28-08-2020T17:06:41,johnnytho,I wonder what hints have we been given about the things we have not seen
28-08-2020T17:06:46,TeapotOfDoom,WOULD one even be able to take her from the estate without ending her life in the process
28-08-2020T17:07:12,TeapotOfDoom,if she's still technically alive
28-08-2020T17:07:25,hyneria,well they would need to find the real Rose first
28-08-2020T17:07:31,hyneria,the one in the garden
28-08-2020T17:07:33,MoonDance,I always thought rose popping up everywhere was interesting

28-08-2020T18:10:15,Twokinds,Yeah I wanted to give Clovis unique eyes.
28-08-2020T18:10:18,IronHorseComics,wouldn't Nora have noticed that?

28-08-2020T18:22:50,RimaDraws,this is looking good
28-08-2020T18:23:01,TeapotOfDoom,the difference is that it doesn't despawn. you can get it back at any point
