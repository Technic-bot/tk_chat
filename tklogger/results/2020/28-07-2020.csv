28-07-2020T20:37:50,CrRAR,no problem too problematic

28-07-2020T20:41:30,CrRAR,a squirrel isn't much more of a stretch
28-07-2020T20:43:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Jesus is the lamb of God...technically you follow Jesus‚Äôs example while praising He & God
28-07-2020T20:43:33,CrRAR,very true
28-07-2020T20:43:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"but I‚Äôd say the squirrel is closer to being a stand in for the Holy Spirit, not Jesus"
28-07-2020T20:43:49,CrRAR,hehe
28-07-2020T20:44:00,Ordithus,if the holy spirit ran up your pant leg

28-07-2020T20:46:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I also studied & know of religion in general but that was a side mission
28-07-2020T20:46:36,CrRAR,The bake sales are probably the best part
28-07-2020T20:46:58,SpazztasticKiwi,my church had yard sales not bake sales
28-07-2020T20:47:14,SpazztasticKiwi,we did have church dinners every fourth Sunday
28-07-2020T20:47:17,CrRAR,any good finds ever?

28-07-2020T20:49:48,SpazztasticKiwi,they would‚Äôve likely thrown them out if I didn‚Äôt take them
28-07-2020T20:49:56,CrRAR,I just liked all its levers and compartments

28-07-2020T20:52:41,CrRAR,pretty much haha
28-07-2020T20:52:49,CrRAR,It was funny because most recently at my newer job one of the engineers brought in an old camera that was his grandpas and it was the same exact model

28-07-2020T21:47:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Ive started to regret Flora becoming Justice because everyone has such a hard on for that ridiculous phrase instead of the actual tarot lore
28-07-2020T21:48:10,CrRAR,I didn't know that was a thing

28-07-2020T21:49:51,CrRAR,oh ok
28-07-2020T21:50:01,AspiringNoodle,Flora hates the phrase just as much :ptv-laugh:
28-07-2020T21:50:09,SpazztasticKiwi,because whether Nibbly turns out to be more than she is and how Trace turns out will determine who fits best
28-07-2020T21:50:23,CrRAR,yeah fate is pretty important to the tarot card lore
28-07-2020T21:50:32,SpazztasticKiwi,never be fooled by the Fool
28-07-2020T21:50:34,CrRAR,The have to EMBODY the figure
