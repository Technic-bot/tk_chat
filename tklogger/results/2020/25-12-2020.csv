25-12-2020T00:00:11,CrRAR,"ah, true"
25-12-2020T00:00:15,Ordithus,though for me I will never turn down a bottle of wine for a gift
25-12-2020T00:00:32,Ordithus,or food
25-12-2020T00:00:36,Dadrobit,My work pays all my bonuses with gift  cards and I hated it.
25-12-2020T00:00:46,Dadrobit,Hate*
25-12-2020T00:00:55,Ordithus,I always forget gift cards
25-12-2020T00:00:59,SageSaga,i saw someone got a 500 dollar gift card to Taco bell
25-12-2020T00:01:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"note to self, when gifting Sage, ask for bank info"
25-12-2020T00:01:06,KeefMcDerpface,Holy hell.
25-12-2020T00:01:09,Dadrobit,"Like, just give me the cash."
25-12-2020T00:01:19,Ordithus,"for convenience, spazz"
25-12-2020T00:01:25,SpazztasticKiwi,totally
25-12-2020T00:01:45,CrRAR,"Check could work, mobile deposit! \o/"
25-12-2020T00:01:56,Dadrobit,"Same, ord. I have several hundred bucks just sitting in different cards collecting dust in one of my desk drawers."
25-12-2020T00:02:10,SageSaga,yeah i can do mobile deposits with checks- or people can just send me money via paypal
25-12-2020T00:02:16,Ordithus,if they were actual cash we'd be rich! rich I tells ya
25-12-2020T00:02:54,SageSaga,gift cards to like - Amazon are great
25-12-2020T00:03:05,SageSaga,because you just add funds to your account and throw away the card
25-12-2020T00:03:14,Dadrobit,I never remember to actually use the gift card I actually have in my wallet so they last forever not doing anything.
25-12-2020T00:03:21,CrRAR,Yeah unless you know the person goes somewhere frequently a gift card to a non-typical place is a chore
25-12-2020T00:03:22,SpazztasticKiwi,the subtlety is very humble
25-12-2020T00:04:52,SageSaga,some gift cards expire if ya dont use em
25-12-2020T00:05:13,Ordithus,companies be like :ctwokinds-adiracoin:
25-12-2020T00:05:18,Ordithus,"""thank you for your donation"""
25-12-2020T00:05:19,Dadrobit,"Yeah, these last 2 years. So it's just that extra little bit of stress"
25-12-2020T00:05:20,CrRAR,so unethical
25-12-2020T00:05:27,CrRAR,very predatory
25-12-2020T00:05:31,CrRAR,Wow
25-12-2020T00:05:40,KeefMcDerpface,"You know something, my parents got me a gift card like 10 years ago to buy some things when I went on a school trip. Never used it and ended up losing it some time after the trip and didn't find it until like 2 years back."
25-12-2020T00:05:40,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
25-12-2020T00:06:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I have maybe $40-50 in gift credit
25-12-2020T00:06:34,SpazztasticKiwi,still no clue what I want
25-12-2020T00:06:45,KeefMcDerpface,"Aunt also got me a Walmart gift card for my birthday a few years back, also never used it."
25-12-2020T00:06:55,CrRAR,"yeah, it really just serves to allow busnesses to have a big revolving fund of non-redeemed money"
25-12-2020T00:07:17,CrRAR,kinda like preorders proceeds
25-12-2020T00:07:21,Dadrobit,"I get quarterly travel expenses and yearly loyalty bonuses, all gift cards. Very annoying."
25-12-2020T00:07:57,Dadrobit,Pre-orders for kickstarters more even
25-12-2020T00:08:02,CrRAR,Yeah employers get some sort of bundle deals where they get those refillable cards for things
25-12-2020T00:08:31,CrRAR,yeah
25-12-2020T00:15:13,Dadrobit,Brb
25-12-2020T00:16:46,Mihari,This must be the flashed comic.
25-12-2020T00:19:14,SpazztasticKiwi,this is a stupid question but what’s a flashed comic
25-12-2020T00:23:31,Ordithus,Nyna doesn't wear underwear

25-12-2020T00:26:36,Ordithus,Merry Christmas Mihari haha
25-12-2020T00:26:56,Ordithus,"if you know Nyna, and Sage, it's easy to see"
25-12-2020T00:27:02,Ordithus,you've become predictable
25-12-2020T00:27:20,SageSaga,Mihari has read the scripts
25-12-2020T00:28:35,Ordithus,you've become sriptable
25-12-2020T00:28:44,Ordithus,*scriptable
25-12-2020T00:28:47,CrRAR,foresight is 20/20
25-12-2020T00:30:31,Mihari,Awwww
25-12-2020T00:30:34,SageSaga,foresight is a 9th level spell
25-12-2020T00:30:48,Mihari,hindsight is 20/20 over.
25-12-2020T00:30:53,Mihari,however*
25-12-2020T00:39:06,Mihari,I kinda figured it would be this comic because well they did just take off and looking up at them... ya know. XD
25-12-2020T00:39:53,SageSaga,cept the lighting requires more light in that area which you dont get with moon light
25-12-2020T00:40:41,CrRAR,soon: 'that's no moon!'
25-12-2020T00:40:53,Ordithus,nah it's a full moon
25-12-2020T00:41:02,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-awoo:
25-12-2020T00:41:02,CrRAR,hehehe
25-12-2020T00:41:21,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-laura: how romantic
25-12-2020T00:42:23,SageSaga,wow the fact that i didnt get much sleep is catching up with me
25-12-2020T00:43:37,CrRAR,every year sleep upgrades to a bigger stick to beat ya with
25-12-2020T00:48:35,SageSaga,ok so- a while ago an anime came out that was- kinda alright- not great but alright-
25-12-2020T00:50:06,SageSaga,and it had this plot that was like- there are 7 heroes that are called forth to destroy the demon lord- and they all end up trapped together in an ancient location with no escape with 8 people - all claiming to be a chosen one-
25-12-2020T00:50:37,SageSaga,so - one of them is a fake- and after a long time they find out who it is- stop them and the barrier goes down and they are free-
25-12-2020T00:51:06,SageSaga,but then another person shows up saying they were trying to get in all this time- because they are one of the legendary heroes- putting them back to 8
25-12-2020T00:51:30,SageSaga,im having trouble figuring out if that's brilliant or terrible
25-12-2020T00:51:51,Ordithus,wait a sec
25-12-2020T00:52:41,SpazztasticKiwi,🛌
