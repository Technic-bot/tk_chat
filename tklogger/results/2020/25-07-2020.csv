25-07-2020T16:29:42,SageSaga,Furries don't have to have fur clearly as scalies are part of the furry Fandom

25-07-2020T16:29:58,ToddDiesel,well... aren't all people considered furry? considering humans have hair? or is their a requisite of an amount of hair?

25-07-2020T16:33:53,MisterWho,I wounder what kind of furry Judge Dredd would be...
25-07-2020T16:33:56,ToddDiesel,so what does that make beastboy?

25-07-2020T16:34:33,ToddDiesel,he can turn into animals... but is himself not really an animal

25-07-2020T16:34:33,SageSaga,Beast boy is a hypocrite
25-07-2020T16:34:33,AspiringNoodle,I don't know if Beastboy counts
25-07-2020T16:34:40,ProsePro7,@ToddDiesel and he also chased after a cat girl so there is a strong leaning to that

25-07-2020T16:34:52,vevans0009,He turns into feral types

25-07-2020T16:36:22,vevans0009,Nope
25-07-2020T16:36:28,ThingsAreMoving,"I guess that's why he's green. He can just use photosynthesis to survive, eh?"

25-07-2020T17:22:03,vevans0009,"Ah just realize what you mean.  Yeah the chat is whack, x3"
25-07-2020T17:22:19,SageSaga,part of the hook here was they are former adventurers from another world- and now they are in Eberon from a destroyed village
25-07-2020T17:22:35,ShamusTheFox,"That would be hilarious, a druid drug lord"
25-07-2020T17:22:37,ProsePro7,This gonna be a long stream this one has taken Tom like two hours so we are looking at like 0100 for end time.  Get comfy everyone
25-07-2020T17:22:41,TeapotOfDoom,may i be so curious as to what class miharis tabaxi is? she looks a bit like a rougue on the painting with the hood
25-07-2020T17:23:02,SageSaga,like a bunch of villagers suddenly gained the knowledge and experience of powerful fighters and magic users
25-07-2020T17:23:02,vevans0009,The Cheetah Queen herself.

25-07-2020T17:24:05,ShamusTheFox,"So it was kinda like, ""How the heck do I know how to cast a fireball? I didn't even study!"""
25-07-2020T17:24:23,SageSaga,they have all their old memories too
25-07-2020T17:24:27,Zanatsu,Such a lovely image.
25-07-2020T17:24:28,unsteddyphoenix,sorcerers irl
25-07-2020T17:24:32,ThingsAreMoving,"Do you feel like their adventures would make a good read, Sage?"
25-07-2020T17:24:45,SageSaga,funny thing is- most of them are freaking out because they realize they are all gonna die of old age soon
25-07-2020T17:24:58,SageSaga,with some tweaks yes
25-07-2020T17:25:01,ShamusTheFox,WHAAAA?!?
25-07-2020T17:25:15,KeefMcDerpface,Most of them?
25-07-2020T17:25:18,ShamusTheFox,"Yeah, that would freak me out too!"
25-07-2020T17:25:22,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
25-07-2020T17:25:24,TeapotOfDoom,i genuinely would read that
25-07-2020T17:25:29,TeapotOfDoom,:cteapotofdoom-nibspartyhard:
25-07-2020T17:25:38,vevans0009,Accelerated aging?
25-07-2020T17:25:40,SageSaga,Well Tom made his character kinda old - Silver used to be a gnome and they can live for a few hundred years- now hes an Orc-
25-07-2020T17:25:43,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
25-07-2020T17:25:52,SageSaga,Orcs only live for like 40-50 years
25-07-2020T17:25:53,BadFoMo,Back.
25-07-2020T17:25:57,Ordithus,wb fomo
25-07-2020T17:25:58,CrRAR,wb
25-07-2020T17:25:59,KeefMcDerpface,wb
25-07-2020T17:26:06,SageSaga,Mihari was a dragon- now shes a catfolk- they only live to like 50
25-07-2020T17:26:12,Ordithus,did they use the fun resurrection spell?
25-07-2020T17:26:13,vevans0009,Wow
25-07-2020T17:26:15,SageSaga,or was it 30-
25-07-2020T17:26:25,vevans0009,Age caps sucks
25-07-2020T17:26:29,unsteddyphoenix,dont druids become immortal
25-07-2020T17:26:34,SageSaga,no
25-07-2020T17:26:47,Ordithus,some magic can increase/decrease your age
25-07-2020T17:26:50,BadFoMo,"Also, @Twokinds, your chat is frozen."
25-07-2020T17:26:56,Ordithus,my goblin character could be killed very easily that way
25-07-2020T17:26:58,ShamusTheFox,"Dying once already, you think they would be reassured about the whole thing."
25-07-2020T17:27:03,TeapotOfDoom,VGM says human life span for tabaxi
25-07-2020T17:27:06,SageSaga,they stop being affected by aging but they still die once their time comes
25-07-2020T17:27:36,BadFoMo,@Twokinds Thanks.
25-07-2020T17:27:39,vevans0009,Like a battery
25-07-2020T17:27:46,unsteddyphoenix,ah tey age 10x slower
25-07-2020T17:27:46,SageSaga,so a druid might look like hes 30 forever but when he reaches around 100 years old - he dies
25-07-2020T17:27:55,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-KatDance: Kat sure is pretty <3
25-07-2020T17:27:59,vevans0009,Truly
25-07-2020T17:28:03,vevans0009,Ord
25-07-2020T17:28:13,vevans0009,She a ten
25-07-2020T17:28:16,RheagarsArtEmporium,Tom the water looks amazing
25-07-2020T17:28:18,unsteddyphoenix,indoubatbly
25-07-2020T17:28:34,johnnytho,scrumptious water
25-07-2020T17:28:35,SageSaga,the majority of the group used to be extremely long lived- and now they are all very short life spanned races XD
25-07-2020T17:28:43,johnnytho,*chefs kiss
25-07-2020T17:29:13,Ordithus,"ohhh I see, the previous characters that reincarnated were super long lived"
25-07-2020T17:29:18,TeapotOfDoom,off i imagine that hits hard
25-07-2020T17:29:21,SageSaga,"i mean- imagine being a dragon that lives for over 3000 years- and then suddenly you are a new race and its like ""Cool- you are an adult already- you have 15 years to live"""
25-07-2020T17:29:23,RheagarsArtEmporium,i was actually swimming in a waterfall today
25-07-2020T17:29:23,Ordithus,stuck in these short lived bodies
25-07-2020T17:29:30,vevans0009,Yikes
25-07-2020T17:29:34,ShamusTheFox,Any of the party looking to shift back to their old races somehow?
25-07-2020T17:29:52,CrRAR,nice
25-07-2020T17:29:57,SageSaga,Mihari is always wanting to obtain immortality it seems XD
25-07-2020T17:30:09,ShamusTheFox,Heh. :)
25-07-2020T17:30:09,TeapotOfDoom,in every game?
25-07-2020T17:30:13,TeapotOfDoom,has she managed to do it?
25-07-2020T17:30:14,SageSaga,in most
25-07-2020T17:30:16,vevans0009,Mihari deserves it
25-07-2020T17:30:16,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,immortal cheetah?
25-07-2020T17:30:19,SageSaga,yeah she has
25-07-2020T17:30:28,SageSaga,the Clone spell is the easiest way to be immortal
25-07-2020T17:30:32,TeapotOfDoom,how is her score so far?
25-07-2020T17:30:40,vevans0009,.....Many Miharis?
25-07-2020T17:30:43,TeapotOfDoom,i mean yeah but that's not true immortality
25-07-2020T17:30:43,vevans0009,8o
25-07-2020T17:30:48,SageSaga,i think shes obtained it twice?
25-07-2020T17:30:53,TeapotOfDoom,nice
25-07-2020T17:30:54,ThingsAreMoving,Are there mind transferrals in D&D ?
25-07-2020T17:30:54,ShamusTheFox,"Ah, backup body."
25-07-2020T17:31:17,SageSaga,Clone legit lets you transfer your soul upon death into a lifeless body clone
25-07-2020T17:31:21,TeapotOfDoom,that sounds like a personal challenge xD
25-07-2020T17:31:42,vevans0009,Its a ref to something.
25-07-2020T17:31:52,falangie123,anyone else getting big stream lag??
25-07-2020T17:31:53,vevans0009,Don't know what.
25-07-2020T17:32:02,CrRAR,fine here fal
25-07-2020T17:32:07,vevans0009,Now it is
25-07-2020T17:32:15,ShamusTheFox,"I forget, you only retain the knowledge from when the clone is made, right? Anything you learn after the clone is made doesn't get included?"
25-07-2020T17:32:23,SageSaga,wrong
25-07-2020T17:32:27,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,that makes me think of the inteligence devourer
25-07-2020T17:32:43,SageSaga,your memories are transferred with your soul
25-07-2020T17:33:08,ShamusTheFox,"OK. I don't play wizards or sorcerers, so my knowledge is limited."
25-07-2020T17:33:11,CrRAR,"hey, experience make your soul what it is, right?"
25-07-2020T17:33:13,ThingsAreMoving,"No lag here, Falangie"
25-07-2020T17:33:39,falangie123,so its just me then
25-07-2020T17:33:42,ShamusTheFox,I know Elminster's rival used the clone spell a lot.
25-07-2020T17:34:19,SageSaga,"there was a long article about a person talking about cloning in D&D and how to get around the issue of not remembering- and then i was like ""you idiot- thats not an issue- its never stated- it says the opposite- your DM house ruled that"" XD"
25-07-2020T17:34:22,ShamusTheFox,I forget his name.
25-07-2020T17:34:39,TeapotOfDoom,lol
25-07-2020T17:34:50,TeapotOfDoom,way to much effort for a non existant problem
25-07-2020T17:34:58,TeapotOfDoom,also clone is 8th level oof
25-07-2020T17:35:15,SageSaga,the clone spell hasnt made you lose EXP since D&D Advanced i think
25-07-2020T17:35:17,ShamusTheFox,"Yeah, it's a serious spell"
25-07-2020T17:35:21,SageSaga,and that article was on 5e
25-07-2020T17:35:32,Twokinds,Done
25-07-2020T17:35:36,SageSaga,clone is best cast as a Wish spell though
25-07-2020T17:35:37,CrRAR,nice
25-07-2020T17:35:38,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-daydreamingkat: Beautiful! <3

25-07-2020T17:36:34,TeapotOfDoom,oof yeah
25-07-2020T17:36:37,CrRAR,livers can regenerate
25-07-2020T17:36:38,SageSaga,open surgery is dangerous XD
25-07-2020T17:36:40,Zakuru,fabulooous
25-07-2020T17:36:42,TeapotOfDoom,but wish is dangerous tho
25-07-2020T17:36:45,CrRAR,like starfish!
25-07-2020T17:36:47,ShamusTheFox,"Meow Mix, Meow Mix please deliver"
25-07-2020T17:36:49,SageSaga,Wish is not dangerous
25-07-2020T17:36:56,TeapotOfDoom,you can loose it
25-07-2020T17:37:02,Xexanoth,not if you use it to just replicate a lower tier spell
25-07-2020T17:37:03,falangie123,livers can regenerate?? time for another beer
25-07-2020T17:37:04,SageSaga,so long as you use it within the bounds of the spell you wont
25-07-2020T17:37:06,Twokinds,I wish for infinite wishes
25-07-2020T17:37:11,partizzan,cute

25-07-2020T17:37:24,Twokinds,I wish for unlimited power
25-07-2020T17:37:27,SageSaga,you would likely put yourself in an infinite time loop

25-07-2020T17:37:54,TeapotOfDoom,oof
25-07-2020T17:38:02,ThingsAreMoving,If you have unlimited power would that mean you can create a boulder that you won't be able to lift?
25-07-2020T17:38:16,SageSaga,"""I wish for infinite wishes"" *loops back to when you cast the spell* ""I wish for infinite wishes"" *Loops back*"

25-07-2020T17:56:04,SageSaga,they have only dont a couple missions- they had just taken on a very low end mission that turned out to be one that took a really long time
25-07-2020T17:56:07,TeapotOfDoom,i'm not sure if that reference was a sunset or a nuke xD

25-07-2020T18:10:49,Stormagedon,Not very secret
25-07-2020T18:10:58,SageSaga,i dont think we consider nuclear fusion reactions to be nukes
25-07-2020T18:11:13,TeapotOfDoom,i mean
25-07-2020T18:11:19,TeapotOfDoom,fusion bombs are basically nukes
25-07-2020T18:11:37,SageSaga,we dont have fusion bombs though-
25-07-2020T18:11:47,TeapotOfDoom,we have
25-07-2020T18:11:56,TeapotOfDoom,hydrogen bombs are fusion based
25-07-2020T18:12:21,Dragusthor,Is that fiction or not?
25-07-2020T18:12:27,Ordithus,very real
25-07-2020T18:12:30,TeapotOfDoom,^
25-07-2020T18:13:02,vevans0009,Looking good
25-07-2020T18:13:03,SageSaga,i thought nukes usually referred to fission bombs
25-07-2020T18:13:15,ThingsAreMoving,"fusion can't be used as weapon, cause it can't be self sustained"
25-07-2020T18:13:24,SageSaga,uhh
25-07-2020T18:13:29,ThingsAreMoving,only fission can be self sustained via chain reaction
25-07-2020T18:13:34,TeapotOfDoom,is sharing the wiki article on the tsar bomba ok?
25-07-2020T18:13:39,SageSaga,i think you got that wrong Things
25-07-2020T18:13:57,TeapotOfDoom,fusion can be as well but it's very very hard
25-07-2020T18:13:58,Glassan,"Yeah, Things, I'm pretty sure you have that backwards."
25-07-2020T18:14:05,SageSaga,you dont need to sustain a reaction for a weapon XD
25-07-2020T18:14:10,Ordithus,"things, the sun is a continuous, self-sustained fusion reaction"
25-07-2020T18:14:13,ThingsAreMoving,"fission is splitting, and that's how normal nukes work"
25-07-2020T18:14:15,Ordithus,And what sage said
25-07-2020T18:14:29,TeapotOfDoom,@Ordithus can i share the wikipedia article
25-07-2020T18:14:30,vevans0009,Yep the sun is like a bomb
25-07-2020T18:14:30,Dragusthor,wow is a topic that is not talked about much.
25-07-2020T18:14:32,TeapotOfDoom,?
25-07-2020T18:14:47,Glassan,"IIRC, fusion, once initiated, can't be stopped or controlled since the energy output generates more fusion reactions."
25-07-2020T18:15:01,SageSaga,the sun is more like a generator burning fuel
25-07-2020T18:15:05,TeapotOfDoom,replace that with fission and you are correct
25-07-2020T18:15:07,Ordithus,just say what it is with the link
25-07-2020T18:15:10,ThingsAreMoving,"Ord, sun has fusion and fission going on at the same time"
25-07-2020T18:15:11,TeapotOfDoom,k
25-07-2020T18:15:16,Glassan,"Unlike fission, which can use neutron absorbing control rods to limit the scope of reactions to controllable levels."
25-07-2020T18:15:21,vevans0009,Always ticking away........
25-07-2020T18:15:35,Glassan,"So fusion can't be used for power plants yet, but can and has been used for bombs."
25-07-2020T18:15:47,Ordithus,"well, we also have functioning fusion reactors.  They just don't produce usable power for practical purposes."

25-07-2020T18:16:31,ThingsAreMoving,that's thermonuclear
25-07-2020T18:16:38,ThingsAreMoving,a fusion weapon

25-07-2020T18:16:54,ProsePro7,How did we go from talking about T&A to nuclear physics?
25-07-2020T18:16:59,ThingsAreMoving,guess i was wrong then
25-07-2020T18:16:59,vevans0009,No clue
25-07-2020T18:17:02,Glassan,I have no idea.

25-07-2020T18:17:16,Ordithus,o/
25-07-2020T18:17:19,KeefMcDerpface,That's this chat for you. Jumping between different topics.
25-07-2020T18:17:23,SageSaga,yall started this with the sun is a nuke comment XD
25-07-2020T18:17:23,ProsePro7,o/ Glass
25-07-2020T18:17:37,KeefMcDerpface,hello Glassan
25-07-2020T18:17:41,TeapotOfDoom,Thermonuclear only means that the nuclear reaction is thermal based
25-07-2020T18:17:42,Stormagedon,"The sun is Fusion, creating new elements by combining two lighter ones. thats why the stuff that is so rare on earth (Like Americanium) is so heavy in its atomic makeup. The older the star gets, the more heavy materials that are made."
25-07-2020T18:17:43,Ordithus,:ptv-uneasy:
25-07-2020T18:17:53,TeapotOfDoom,temperature for fusion is extremely high
25-07-2020T18:17:54,Rainelover,Never underestimate the ability of humanity to harness wonderful technology to make terrible weapons of mass destruction
25-07-2020T18:18:02,vevans0009,^
25-07-2020T18:18:03,TeapotOfDoom,*needed for fusion
25-07-2020T18:18:10,falangie123,new topic: will natani ever be seen in a bikini?
25-07-2020T18:18:11,vevans0009,Always need a bigger stick
25-07-2020T18:18:15,TeapotOfDoom,it's always about weapons
25-07-2020T18:18:18,SageSaga,i was just stating that we generally use Nuke to refer to as a weapon - usually a fusion bomb- i guess some might include H-Bomb in that too though
25-07-2020T18:18:22,vevans0009,Nat in a bikini? 8o
25-07-2020T18:18:25,Stormagedon,Fission is the breaking of an atom
25-07-2020T18:18:30,SageSaga,so that would be fusion but again- Sun is more of a generator than a bomb
25-07-2020T18:18:34,TeapotOfDoom,fission bomb
25-07-2020T18:18:47,Ordithus,Bikini Nat :ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:
25-07-2020T18:18:51,TeapotOfDoom,uranium and plutonium are fission fuels
25-07-2020T18:18:58,Ordithus,https://www.deviantart.com/twokinds/art/Secret-Sunset-Rendezvous-133735126
25-07-2020T18:18:58,TeapotOfDoom,hydrogen is a fusion fuel
25-07-2020T18:19:17,vevans0009,Tom needs to update that. x3
25-07-2020T18:19:22,TeapotOfDoom,most used fusion fuels are tritium and deuterium
25-07-2020T18:19:38,TeapotOfDoom,but those are mostly for energy generation
25-07-2020T18:19:49,Stormagedon,"Sage, as soon as a star starts running out of hydrogen to fuse, it starts burning other stuff. and slowly dies. All stars are ticking time bombs on a massive scale"
25-07-2020T18:19:58,TeapotOfDoom,^
25-07-2020T18:20:04,TeapotOfDoom,red giant much
25-07-2020T18:20:11,SageSaga,they dont all explode in a super nova
25-07-2020T18:20:18,Stormagedon,"""Matter can neither be created or destroyed"""
25-07-2020T18:20:19,Glassan,That they do not.
25-07-2020T18:20:25,TeapotOfDoom,Sol will consume mars at the end of her lifecycle
25-07-2020T18:20:28,ThingsAreMoving,Depends on their mass mostly
25-07-2020T18:20:28,SageSaga,so not all stars are ticking time bombs #notallstars
25-07-2020T18:20:36,vevans0009,The knowing scares me.
25-07-2020T18:20:40,Stormagedon,They do all do something on death
25-07-2020T18:20:46,Ordithus,we're a few years away from that
25-07-2020T18:20:48,TeapotOfDoom,it's still 5 billion years till them
25-07-2020T18:20:51,TeapotOfDoom,then
25-07-2020T18:21:00,Stormagedon,and it usually does something very big
25-07-2020T18:21:09,SageSaga,and nuclear generators can go critical too- they are still generators
25-07-2020T18:21:12,ThingsAreMoving,I hope Tom can manage to finish the comic by then :eyes:
25-07-2020T18:21:20,TeapotOfDoom,not really
25-07-2020T18:21:30,TeapotOfDoom,plasma temp will drop and fusion will cut out
25-07-2020T18:21:31,Glassan,"Pretty sure humanity will have found a way to other stars, or long since died out by the time the sun goes red-giant."
25-07-2020T18:21:42,TeapotOfDoom,fusion is not self sustaining in contrast to fission
25-07-2020T18:21:42,SageSaga,im sure if you feed a combustion engine constantly long enough theres a chance it too will explode
25-07-2020T18:21:57,Stormagedon,"To dense and it forms a black hole, the other way it just kinda releses its stuff its been making out into the world, then slowly burns out"
25-07-2020T18:21:57,TeapotOfDoom,well that's the nice thing about fusion
25-07-2020T18:22:03,TeapotOfDoom,is instable as hell
25-07-2020T18:22:10,TeapotOfDoom,so if something happens it will just stop
25-07-2020T18:22:15,Rainelover,@vevans0009 knowing is half the battle
25-07-2020T18:22:30,vevans0009,x3
25-07-2020T18:22:46,JSWolf,Looking at this and the Kat sketches makes me wonder: what are Kat and Zen doing while the manor tries to kill everyone else?
25-07-2020T18:22:50,Rainelover,The other half is German imperialism
25-07-2020T18:22:55,vevans0009,dun dun dun
25-07-2020T18:23:06,Ordithus,"hiding together, in the closet."
25-07-2020T18:23:11,vevans0009,;P
25-07-2020T18:23:12,Glassan,"Until then, that massive generator ball in the sky does make some pretty colors for this kind of scene."
25-07-2020T18:23:14,TeapotOfDoom,i mean the only thing that could really go wrong is the steam turbine exploding from over preassure but that's not really dangerous from a nuclear standpoint
25-07-2020T18:23:24,ProsePro7,@JSWolf Bow chika wow wow
25-07-2020T18:23:30,JSWolf,"My friend responded ""kissing in Berlin, apparently"" which I appreciated"
25-07-2020T18:24:05,TeapotOfDoom,one thing that sucks tho is the fusion activating the heat shield. so whatever is used to shield the reactor starts to be radio active and decay
25-07-2020T18:24:27,SageSaga,"Natani - ""Keith... the sun is a giant generator constantly fueled by the massive amounts of fuel that makes up most of its body, the energy it puts out is massively dangerous to humans if they are exposed too much"""
25-07-2020T18:24:31,ThingsAreMoving,"Well, there's always a chance that the magnetic containment for plasma could fail, but I bet that's where they put a lot of failsafes"

25-07-2020T21:03:12,JSWolf,I somehow ended up turning 20 when I wasn't looking though
25-07-2020T21:03:13,johnnytho,There had been people in chat admitt they're under 18
25-07-2020T21:03:14,KeefMcDerpface,"Well, bye everyone under 18."
25-07-2020T21:03:21,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,bans Maddie

25-07-2020T21:04:22,steelabjur,"Chats too lewd for Maddie, she'd ban herself."
25-07-2020T21:04:26,JSWolf,Are we millenials? Are we zoomers? Nobody knows!
25-07-2020T21:04:27,vevans0009,hehe
25-07-2020T21:04:29,unsteddyphoenix,Haha true
25-07-2020T21:04:33,beastlee99,Yeah...
25-07-2020T21:04:39,JSWolf,We're just vibing
25-07-2020T21:04:40,ThingsAreMoving,I'm a millenial... I think
25-07-2020T21:04:40,vevans0009,So cute
25-07-2020T21:04:48,IronHorseComics,you say that JSW
25-07-2020T21:04:49,ThingsAreMoving,dunno tbh
25-07-2020T21:04:53,beastlee99,"I was born Dec 31, so I REALLY don't know"
25-07-2020T21:04:54,TheSexyBeast,"""funny, it FEELS personal..."""
25-07-2020T21:04:59,IronHorseComics,I'm a millennial for sure
25-07-2020T21:05:00,BADBackgroundProductions,"Is it me, or is Nora getting creepier the longer she stands there?"
25-07-2020T21:05:05,Glassan,Boomer Tom bout to ding his next level.
25-07-2020T21:05:06,KeefMcDerpface,yes
25-07-2020T21:05:07,beastlee99,I was a day off of zoomer
25-07-2020T21:05:08,Ordithus,*cuter
25-07-2020T21:05:08,vevans0009,Nah
25-07-2020T21:05:39,JSWolf,My actual answer is that generations aren't really a useful concept
25-07-2020T21:05:41,Glassan,I don't even know what the real year cutoffs are for all these generation definitions.
25-07-2020T21:05:56,BADBackgroundProductions,Also realized that she only has two teeth which is also weird
25-07-2020T21:06:16,TheSexyBeast,Incisors
25-07-2020T21:06:19,KeefMcDerpface,^
25-07-2020T21:06:24,beastlee99,Doesn't she have three teeth? lol
25-07-2020T21:06:25,ShamusTheFox,BUT THEY'RE SHARP
25-07-2020T21:06:27,Ordithus,canines
25-07-2020T21:06:31,JSWolf,They're meant to denote what culture a group grew up with but culture is fluid so creating hard cutoffs as generations require doesn't really reflect the reality of human behaviors
25-07-2020T21:06:33,beastlee99,There's one in the middle
25-07-2020T21:06:47,johnnytho,Tom Cruise style?
25-07-2020T21:06:48,TheSexyBeast,What Ord said
25-07-2020T21:07:21,BADBackgroundProductions,"One extra thick tooth in the middle, yeah that seems right"
25-07-2020T21:07:47,JSWolf,Her teeth mirror her tatas and the fur tuft in the middle
25-07-2020T21:07:49,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,her lips are covering the rest lol
25-07-2020T21:09:16,vevans0009,Gotta have sharp teeth
25-07-2020T21:10:02,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,I gotta go eat brb afk\
25-07-2020T21:10:12,KeefMcDerpface,bye Deathclaw

25-07-2020T21:10:19,ThingsAreMoving,enjoy your noms o/
25-07-2020T21:10:27,BADBackgroundProductions,Good bye
25-07-2020T21:10:43,JSWolf,Oh I'm a moron
25-07-2020T21:10:54,JSWolf,I should suggest Erilas against the glass
25-07-2020T21:11:10,beastlee99,That'll get colored for sure
25-07-2020T21:11:16,Ordithus,glass can't handle her
25-07-2020T21:11:21,KeefMcDerpface,lol
25-07-2020T21:11:42,TheSexyBeast,Buncha horn dogs in here...üòâ
25-07-2020T21:11:49,IronHorseComics,there you go dude
25-07-2020T21:11:51,vevans0009,Erilas be great
25-07-2020T21:11:58,johnnytho,"as usual, sexy"
25-07-2020T21:12:24,beastlee99,I'm mad there hasn't been a reference sheet of a guy colored (besides Nat of course)
25-07-2020T21:12:34,BADBackgroundProductions,I would personally like to see more like the Demon Trace v. Angel Flora
25-07-2020T21:12:36,beastlee99,But Nat's a unique exception
25-07-2020T21:12:36,vevans0009,Well....
25-07-2020T21:13:00,johnnytho,Didn't we get Trace?
25-07-2020T21:13:02,vevans0009,The gals are pretty.
25-07-2020T21:13:07,IronHorseComics,"well actually there was, Trace got one"
25-07-2020T21:13:11,vevans0009,x>
25-07-2020T21:13:14,Ordithus,his tiger form
25-07-2020T21:13:21,IronHorseComics,"and I *think* Keith, though I may be mistaken"
25-07-2020T21:13:24,beastlee99,"Keidran Trace was colored, but it's not in depth like regular ref sheets"
25-07-2020T21:13:33,beastlee99,Not Keith tho
25-07-2020T21:13:40,TheSexyBeast,Wasnt Mike and Evals ref sheet colored?
25-07-2020T21:13:44,Ordithus,nope
25-07-2020T21:13:58,Dragusthor,You can see that it is supported by the glass
25-07-2020T21:15:06,beastlee99,I predict the Reni ref sheet will be drawn and colored before Keith's gets colored
25-07-2020T21:15:30,Ordithus,"considering they're all past color votes, that is probably a safe bet"
25-07-2020T21:15:38,beastlee99,Someone please prove me wrong tho
25-07-2020T21:17:11,BADBackgroundProductions,"So, how long has everyone been a part of this chat crew (if that‚Äôs what you call it?)"
25-07-2020T21:17:29,vevans0009,Uhm...
25-07-2020T21:17:33,vevans0009,Today?

25-07-2020T21:18:03,BlackjackSec99,"hi things, keef!"
25-07-2020T21:18:20,Ordithus,I lurked until Tom drew Saria drawing Rose
25-07-2020T21:18:22,ThingsAreMoving,I've been here since Nov 2017 If I remember correctly
25-07-2020T21:18:22,BlackjackSec99,"Bad, ive been here since... march? feb?"
25-07-2020T21:18:28,Dragusthor,hi Blackjack What's up?
25-07-2020T21:18:41,BlackjackSec99,Dragus!

25-07-2020T21:19:52,KeefMcDerpface,Then welcome Twokinds to Twokinds.
25-07-2020T21:19:54,johnnytho,nice tom
25-07-2020T21:19:56,BADBackgroundProductions,I just discovered TwoKinds back in October of last year and I have been a fan ever since
25-07-2020T21:20:15,johnnytho,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/1075/ this was the latest page when I found the comic
25-07-2020T21:20:18,ShamusTheFox,Squish
25-07-2020T21:20:26,IronHorseComics,we've all gone stircrazy
25-07-2020T21:20:32,JSWolf,"I found Twokinds in 2015-ish, I think?"
25-07-2020T21:20:42,unsteddyphoenix,ive been here since the dawn of time
25-07-2020T21:20:50,beastlee99,"The first time I read TK all the way through it ended at 1111, which I thought was pretty cool"
25-07-2020T21:20:50,johnnytho,old!
25-07-2020T21:20:53,AspiringNoodle,I think I found Twokinds 5 years or so into its run
25-07-2020T21:20:56,JSWolf,"Or no, wait, 2016ish"
25-07-2020T21:21:03,JSWolf,Around that time lmao
25-07-2020T21:21:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Ever sense Nat started her out of body experience
25-07-2020T21:21:14,HeresyArtStream,that kitty Nora <3
25-07-2020T21:21:17,Ordithus,I started reading immediately after the great April Fools' fiasco
25-07-2020T21:21:18,IronHorseComics,"sooo, Steddy's admitting they're actually Nora in disguise?"
25-07-2020T21:21:31,beastlee99,I tried reading it two years ago but because of other stuff I ran out of time
25-07-2020T21:21:31,KeefMcDerpface,That explains everything.
25-07-2020T21:21:34,johnnytho,What fiasco ?
25-07-2020T21:21:41,Combak,Don't ask.
25-07-2020T21:21:42,Ordithus,so got to see the Nat and Keith big smooch for when I caught up <3
25-07-2020T21:21:45,johnnytho,ok
25-07-2020T21:21:51,beastlee99,Then the Sythe/Maren pages came out and got me... uh... interested again
25-07-2020T21:21:55,ShamusTheFox,"I found Twokinds through Freefall, and my very first comic was the fight between Keith and Natani at the Basitin Inn."
25-07-2020T21:21:58,Combak,"And I joined a bit before that. A year, at least."
25-07-2020T21:22:15,AspiringNoodle,Correction: 6 years in.  I started reading Twokinds on the tail end of the Basitin Isles arc
25-07-2020T21:22:24,TheSexyBeast,I started reading right about the time Neutral first appeared
25-07-2020T21:22:33,beastlee99,oh my god
25-07-2020T21:22:38,JSWolf,"I'd heard of it in passing and when I ended up trapped in a hotel room in Northborough, MA (long story), I decided ""What the fuck, I have nothing better to do, might as well binge this entire comic"""
25-07-2020T21:22:39,Ordithus,Page... 2?  Or was it 3...

25-07-2020T21:22:45,ThingsAreMoving,^
25-07-2020T21:22:51,KeefMcDerpface,So the beginning?
25-07-2020T21:22:56,BlackjackSec99,I saw a few random sketches on tumbler and asked around about the rather cute tiger and found the comic
25-07-2020T21:22:59,vevans0009,Started reading when it basically started
25-07-2020T21:23:07,vevans0009,By accident
25-07-2020T21:23:13,FenceEqualizer,Hey happy peeps
25-07-2020T21:23:16,vevans0009,Never stopped

25-07-2020T21:23:21,KeefMcDerpface,hello Fence
25-07-2020T21:23:21,JSWolf,I don't actually remember where I first heard of it ngl
25-07-2020T21:23:22,BADBackgroundProductions,The only comic that I had ever read before Twokinds was the Pocket God comic book series
25-07-2020T21:23:28,ThingsAreMoving,\o/ Fence!

25-07-2020T21:23:39,ThingsAreMoving,\o Mvilu!
25-07-2020T21:23:40,MuonNeutrino,"i started reading the comic back in 2012 during the early parts of the boat ride, didn't join the forums for a year after that and these streams for..... i dunno, when did tom start streaming on picarto as opposed to the older places?"
25-07-2020T21:23:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,HI Mvilu
25-07-2020T21:23:42,KeefMcDerpface,hello Mvilu

25-07-2020T21:24:06,MuonNeutrino,"and I likewise got directed to the comic from Freefall, where mark posted some of tom's freefall fanart"
25-07-2020T21:24:09,beastlee99,"I swear I heard the phrase ""you can call me Maddie for short, or Madness for long"" a long time ago. Did it really come from TK?"
25-07-2020T21:24:11,MviluUatusun,I'm finally caught up with my story.  I can't upload any more chapters for a couple of weeks or more.
25-07-2020T21:24:16,AspiringNoodle,Hoi mvilu :D
25-07-2020T21:24:54,TheSexyBeast,Hey mvilu
25-07-2020T21:25:02,JSWolf,But I do remember sitting in that hotel room and reading the entire thing (880ish pages at that point) in one sitting
25-07-2020T21:25:17,JSWolf,I had literally nothing better to do
25-07-2020T21:25:25,JSWolf,Northborough MA is not a town of many attractions
25-07-2020T21:25:28,BlackjackSec99,I... binged it over 3 days...
25-07-2020T21:25:43,BADBackgroundProductions,... You too?

25-07-2020T21:26:06,BlackjackSec99,"yeah, work, eat, TK, work, eat, TK..... there wasent much sleep...."
25-07-2020T21:26:21,JSWolf,Or wait actually I might've been in Marlborough
25-07-2020T21:26:24,BlackjackSec99,I think I picked it up a few pages before the mansion beach
25-07-2020T21:26:24,MviluUatusun,"Well, when I'm far behind on a comic, I binge by reading 10 pages a day until I get caught up."
25-07-2020T21:26:29,johnnytho,Amateurs 1075 pages... 1 day
