07-07-2020T10:15:17,Xexanoth,so an alcohol free version of malibu-o?
07-07-2020T10:16:26,CrRAR,"Pretty much, it would probably mix pretty well with something haha"
07-07-2020T10:17:50,CrRAR,It’s just a couple ingrediants away from being a pina colada

07-07-2020T20:36:21,CrRAR,Speaking of thunderstorms we had a lightning strike that felt like and sounded like it was right on top of us

07-07-2020T20:55:33,CrRAR,Home is where the herpetology is
07-07-2020T20:55:41,CrRAR,:snake:
07-07-2020T20:56:14,SpazztasticKiwi,copperheads are venomous
07-07-2020T20:56:37,SpazztasticKiwi,and this one was on the front steps
07-07-2020T20:56:43,CrRAR,Have you tried any deterrents?
07-07-2020T20:56:57,CrRAR,Maybe adopt a mongoose?
07-07-2020T20:57:00,SpazztasticKiwi,no not at all totally never crossed our minds
07-07-2020T20:57:11,SpazztasticKiwi,you realize I’m not joking
07-07-2020T20:57:18,CrRAR,oh I know
07-07-2020T20:57:27,CrRAR,Is there anything you can do?
07-07-2020T20:57:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I am damn well ready to move state because my mother and sister can’t be bothered to get off their asses and clean
07-07-2020T20:58:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"the first time I came across the first one, I said “clean. the. burn. pile”"
07-07-2020T20:59:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"but no, they’re not concerned"
07-07-2020T20:59:12,CrRAR,"Yeah, you mentioned that they been hiding out in there"
07-07-2020T20:59:39,SpazztasticKiwi,mother always aches or has a migraine yet she’s often more than ready if the family goes shopping out of town
07-07-2020T21:00:08,SpazztasticKiwi,my sister has been allowed to do whatever she wants until here recently since I’ve put my foot down in the matter
07-07-2020T21:00:36,SpazztasticKiwi,you know my mother actually told me I should look for another place to live because I’ve been so “disagreeable”
07-07-2020T21:01:20,CrRAR,Well a dangerous snake skulking around is kind of a reason to be.
07-07-2020T21:01:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"and why don’t I clean the pile? because every time I get something done, they’re right behind me to mess it right back up"
07-07-2020T21:02:35,SpazztasticKiwi,and I don’t have the interest in picking at a venom infested leaf & trash heap
07-07-2020T21:02:58,SpazztasticKiwi,not without a backhoe....or thick ass pants
07-07-2020T21:04:09,CrRAR,"if it was to be pants, have to be like gaiters or something rubbery"
07-07-2020T21:06:59,CrRAR,Are there services to take care of venomous snakes?
07-07-2020T21:07:33,SpazztasticKiwi,hahahahahahahahahahahabahahahahahaha
07-07-2020T21:07:59,SpazztasticKiwi,you mean the snake removers I tried contacting over three months ago when this started?
07-07-2020T21:08:33,CrRAR,"well, sounds like that didn't work out"
07-07-2020T21:08:33,SpazztasticKiwi,they won’t be troubled to come down unless the snake stays visible for their 45 minute drive down here
07-07-2020T21:09:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"and at the time, I’d spotted two"
07-07-2020T21:09:26,SpazztasticKiwi,they can legitimately kiss my ass
07-07-2020T21:09:51,CrRAR,"That's silly, how would anyone ensure a snake stays still that long?"
07-07-2020T21:10:04,CrRAR,FREEZE... SNAKE!
07-07-2020T21:10:12,CrRAR,I'm calling the snake police
07-07-2020T21:11:12,CrRAR,"maybe if the snake was indoors, like those news stories you see about people who find them in the strangest places."
07-07-2020T21:12:06,SpazztasticKiwi,they generally catch snakes that wander in houses
07-07-2020T21:12:32,SpazztasticKiwi,but these are on the steps
07-07-2020T21:12:39,SpazztasticKiwi,close enough
07-07-2020T21:15:01,Ordithus,"you should have seen it, the strangest thing"
07-07-2020T21:15:20,Ordithus,"pouring rain, soaked me head to toe"
07-07-2020T21:15:33,Ordithus,"and the oddest part is, it was confined entirely to my bathroom"

07-07-2020T21:18:08,CrRAR,Is this some kind of riddle?
07-07-2020T21:18:17,Ordithus,oh so that's what happened

07-07-2020T21:35:48,AspiringNoodle,I'm behind the development curve

07-07-2020T21:37:54,SpazztasticKiwi,nonsense is an understatement
07-07-2020T21:38:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m perpetually annoyed since my dad died
07-07-2020T21:39:49,CrRAR,"my dad moved away, though present, he was kind of a not good role model ;_;"
07-07-2020T21:40:07,CrRAR,he's in florida now
07-07-2020T21:40:17,CrRAR,"Was that super long ago, spazz?"
07-07-2020T21:40:59,SpazztasticKiwi,12 years
07-07-2020T21:41:55,SpazztasticKiwi,28 days after my 12th birthday so 11 years and I don’t care to count the months ago if you wanna split hairs
07-07-2020T21:42:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"mine wasn’t the role model either but while it’s better he’s gone, my sister started walking on water shortly after so"
07-07-2020T21:45:45,Ordithus,where would you move to if you could?
07-07-2020T21:46:27,SpazztasticKiwi,if cash wasn’t an issue my ass would be in California
07-07-2020T21:46:31,SpazztasticKiwi,as far as possible
07-07-2020T21:46:56,SpazztasticKiwi,as much as I’d hate the city
07-07-2020T21:46:59,Ordithus,Alaska or Hawaii are further!  Real hermit places.
07-07-2020T21:47:05,CrRAR,haha
07-07-2020T21:47:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve had eyes at Cincinnati
07-07-2020T21:48:09,SpazztasticKiwi,california has family but so does cinci & Georgia
07-07-2020T21:48:55,CrRAR,Travelling is a good way to gain perspective.
07-07-2020T21:49:01,SpazztasticKiwi,tolerable family
07-07-2020T21:49:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I was in Cincinnati in 2014 to see the zoo

07-07-2020T21:50:03,Dadrobit,#QualitySuggestion?
07-07-2020T21:50:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"as for anywhere else I’ve been to Boston, Tennessee, Georgia, Mississippi & Kentucky"
07-07-2020T21:50:38,SpazztasticKiwi,all southern places besides Boston & it was for just PAX
07-07-2020T21:51:14,SpazztasticKiwi,sounds fine I guess
07-07-2020T21:51:39,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:*[L-lewd!]
07-07-2020T21:59:04,CrRAR,"When you've traveled a bit to different places it makes all of your past seem less in focus and gives perspective to what matters. It's just YOU that stays the same in the new place. You can change your attitude and yourself anywhere, some places easier"
07-07-2020T21:59:24,CrRAR,"than others, you just have to remember to keep accomplishing things to make yourself proud and keep making progess. Parents may be our early cheerleaders in life but eventually we have to be our own anyway."
07-07-2020T22:00:23,CrRAR,It's one of those growing up things
07-07-2020T22:00:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve taken care of my own for close to ten years
07-07-2020T22:00:36,CrRAR,yeah!
07-07-2020T22:01:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"like I said, my mother prefers to sit around and do nothing like my sister if she’s not at work"
07-07-2020T22:01:37,SpazztasticKiwi,for her credit she’s disabled since she spent 20 years “helping” my dad
07-07-2020T22:02:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"but after I got her off my back by turning 18 and no longer controllable, more than plenty has fallen to me"
07-07-2020T22:02:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"if sister says she doesn’t want to do it, I get bagered until it happens"
07-07-2020T22:03:48,SpazztasticKiwi,oh but she doesn’t play favorites
07-07-2020T22:04:24,CrRAR,"yeah, too much of unchanging sameness can be irritating"
07-07-2020T22:08:02,AspiringNoodle,Parents who burden their children willfully are the worst -_-
07-07-2020T22:11:27,CrRAR,"Yeah, one thing I believe is that there are redeeming qualities to be found in anyone. Many people are flawed in some way, just try and learn from the good sides of people/parents."
07-07-2020T22:15:51,SpazztasticKiwi,bullshit
07-07-2020T22:16:09,SpazztasticKiwi,my mother has had chances before in the past
07-07-2020T22:16:29,SpazztasticKiwi,she doesn’t and has never seen herself as wrong
07-07-2020T22:25:15,CrRAR,people can get stuck in certain ways of thinking especially if it works for them
07-07-2020T22:25:33,SpazztasticKiwi,still not an excuse
07-07-2020T22:25:41,CrRAR,nope
07-07-2020T22:32:31,CrRAR,"yeah, trust me, the ability of someone to keep up an irrational train of thought is astounding"
07-07-2020T22:34:06,CrRAR,sometimes that train is to florida
07-07-2020T22:34:31,CrRAR,and that my friends is how a Floridaman:tm: is born cD

07-07-2020T22:35:01,CrRAR,lol
07-07-2020T22:47:29,AspiringNoodle,While I will admit there is a merit to looking at the best parts of people
07-07-2020T22:47:43,AspiringNoodle,Sometimes you just have to acknowledge that they're such pieces of shit in every other regard that the good doesn't matter
07-07-2020T22:47:53,AspiringNoodle,Just my 2 cents
07-07-2020T22:48:14,AspiringNoodle,"Also, apologies for my swears ._."
07-07-2020T22:49:01,CrRAR,true
07-07-2020T22:51:18,Ordithus,I can think of a few examples

07-07-2020T23:00:18,CrRAR,yes quite a representative selection
07-07-2020T23:04:53,CrRAR,spazz did you submit the other Maeve idea you had for sketch suggestions or something different?
07-07-2020T23:12:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I haven’t bothered to pop over to that side of life at the moment
07-07-2020T23:13:00,CrRAR,I feel ya
07-07-2020T23:13:44,CrRAR,Now I'm wondering what the goodiegoodiegoodie thing was about haha
07-07-2020T23:13:57,CrRAR,I thought it was about the suggestions thing being posted
07-07-2020T23:14:08,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s not even any telling when Tom flaked off
07-07-2020T23:15:01,CrRAR,I think it was a while ago
07-07-2020T23:15:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"I have 3 ideas I’m tied on but since two that I’ve spitballed here have been submitted by other people, I’ll decide on my own"
07-07-2020T23:15:39,CrRAR,coolcool
07-07-2020T23:16:20,SpazztasticKiwi,it was shortly after I started bombing chat
07-07-2020T23:17:11,SpazztasticKiwi,something about his allergies getting him real bad then I’d gotten off work so I was free to see the suggestion box was open
07-07-2020T23:17:24,SpazztasticKiwi,this the goodiegoodiegoodiegoodie
07-07-2020T23:17:28,SpazztasticKiwi,thus

07-07-2020T23:18:36,CrRAR,yeah that's a buzzkill
07-07-2020T23:19:09,SpazztasticKiwi,which became my opening for the closet to air out
07-07-2020T23:19:21,Ordithus,"venom, ew.  give me a bear.  at least it seems right."
07-07-2020T23:19:34,SpazztasticKiwi,and then he peaced out
07-07-2020T23:20:21,SpazztasticKiwi,might actually be dying tho
07-07-2020T23:20:43,SpazztasticKiwi,cinci is showing stop start rain and then sun
07-07-2020T23:21:11,SpazztasticKiwi,back & forth most definitely has to have the pollon counts confused

07-07-2020T23:21:23,CrRAR,D:

07-07-2020T23:21:57,SpazztasticKiwi,plants be like “do we dust or do we not? we sick of the sun saying yes only to have hard work washed by rain”
07-07-2020T23:22:03,Ordithus,the sun is probably still up in Anchorage
07-07-2020T23:22:10,CrRAR,true
07-07-2020T23:22:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"teeeeechnically, the sun is always up"
07-07-2020T23:22:25,SpazztasticKiwi,we’re just spinning
07-07-2020T23:22:41,CrRAR,That reminds me of the xkcd's where it has the parody weather forecasts for the apocalypse or whatever
07-07-2020T23:23:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"not to be confused with spiraling, because that’s 2020’s job"

07-07-2020T23:24:01,SpazztasticKiwi,sounds about right
07-07-2020T23:24:14,SpazztasticKiwi,you know they found an undiscovered cave sealed up
07-07-2020T23:24:31,SpazztasticKiwi,they think it’s been untouched for “thousands” of years
07-07-2020T23:24:51,Ordithus,cool!  where at?
07-07-2020T23:24:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"personally, I suggest we seal it tf back up and leave it"
07-07-2020T23:25:06,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s not the year
07-07-2020T23:25:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Romania

07-07-2020T23:26:01,SpazztasticKiwi,don’t care
07-07-2020T23:26:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"we don’t need it - whatever it has, we don’t need it"
07-07-2020T23:26:29,Dadrobit,Back! At work and nothing is functional! Work is cancelled! \o/
07-07-2020T23:26:39,CrRAR,oh no

07-07-2020T23:26:57,CrRAR,That's when the ninjas attack
07-07-2020T23:27:05,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s a literal movie called the Cave that’s the exact same premise and We Don’t Need It
07-07-2020T23:27:06,Ordithus,watch out for Adam Jensen
07-07-2020T23:27:23,Dadrobit,"Yep, guy before me tried updating Windows without IT support and it ruined everything forever."
07-07-2020T23:27:30,Ordithus,oh no
07-07-2020T23:27:36,CrRAR,dangit
07-07-2020T23:27:43,Ordithus,but... how do you even screw that up?

07-07-2020T23:29:06,SpazztasticKiwi,computer: “I’m sorry. I do not recognize this system”
07-07-2020T23:29:12,Ordithus,security so secure it secures itself out of security

07-07-2020T23:30:16,Dadrobit,It's recursive. Like when a movie is so bad it's good.
07-07-2020T23:30:27,CrRAR,lol spazz that reminds me of the Independence Day movie virus
07-07-2020T23:30:49,Dadrobit,Except this is a movie that's so good it's bad.... Like 2001: A Space Odyssey or something.
07-07-2020T23:30:55,CrRAR,true

07-07-2020T23:31:45,CrRAR,"Dad should live in that universe, a world where Mac is compatible with alien technology is probably where his Windows would be compatible with anything"
07-07-2020T23:32:03,CrRAR,Plus ALIENS!

07-07-2020T23:35:12,CrRAR,:v: ord
07-07-2020T23:35:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I can picture naked ankles everywhere & Maddie with a scarf wrapped around her face like “nope”
07-07-2020T23:36:00,SpazztasticKiwi,then she starts bumping into everyone....touching bare..uh skin?
07-07-2020T23:36:04,CrRAR,"Yeah, ankle-high dresses... everywhere"
07-07-2020T23:36:17,SpazztasticKiwi,them sexy ankles
07-07-2020T23:36:52,Dadrobit,Literally just Maddie surrounded by a censor mosaic.
07-07-2020T23:37:16,CrRAR,"""...and the high heels..."""
07-07-2020T23:37:22,CrRAR,*Maddie shudders*
07-07-2020T23:37:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I still wonder why Maeve stealing Maddie’s line art never did well
07-07-2020T23:38:37,CrRAR,like leaving a her borderless?
07-07-2020T23:38:57,CrRAR,accidentally 'a'
07-07-2020T23:39:14,Dadrobit,Just wasn't sure if Maddie being flustered was on brand or not. She hasn't really shown herself to be flusterable by things outside of how her superiors treated her.
07-07-2020T23:40:10,Dadrobit,"The incentive even showed her trying to go ankle commando, so I dunno if the suggest really worked"
07-07-2020T23:40:11,CrRAR,What about when Karen was inquiring about ear etiquette?
07-07-2020T23:40:33,CrRAR,yeah bold moment
07-07-2020T23:40:57,Dadrobit,"I mean, physical contact is kinda next level over general nutity no?"
07-07-2020T23:41:02,CrRAR,Would have gotten away with it too if it wasn't for that meddling Keith
07-07-2020T23:41:07,Dadrobit,Nudity*
07-07-2020T23:41:29,Dadrobit,Darn you meddling Keith's!
07-07-2020T23:41:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"Maddie’s all for the ankles being covered & after the swimsuit scene, Maeve going another step and making her look more naked ..."
07-07-2020T23:42:15,Dadrobit,The other option was Maddie begrudgingly enjoying herself a bit at the gala. But that's not quite as funny imho.
07-07-2020T23:42:19,SpazztasticKiwi,art with no lines is just....nude art
07-07-2020T23:42:38,CrRAR,harharhar
07-07-2020T23:42:39,SpazztasticKiwi,how’d Maddie look at a hot tub

07-07-2020T23:48:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t see Tom doing a hint at a porn opening

07-07-2020T23:56:32,AspiringNoodle,"pardon my language, but I look up, there's a house centipede in the middle of my wall"
07-07-2020T23:56:51,AspiringNoodle,"I look down at chat, 5 seconds later, look up again, thing is gone"
07-07-2020T23:56:54,AspiringNoodle,Am I going crazy?!?
07-07-2020T23:57:51,Dadrobit,Had a face sized tarantula appear on my wall a few weeks back if that's comparable.
