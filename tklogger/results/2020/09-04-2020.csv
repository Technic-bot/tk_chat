09-04-2020T00:35:30,CrimsonQuill,Maybe I need to use more tags
09-04-2020T00:35:44,CrimsonQuill,I searched #Halo on Deviantart

09-04-2020T00:37:11,JojoGD,I never uploaded it anywhere
09-04-2020T00:37:20,CrimsonQuill,I kinda want to draw the guys from those Astartes short
09-04-2020T00:37:29,CrimsonQuill,The Retributor Space Marines

09-04-2020T00:56:14,AspiringNoodle,"1, I swear I've had this on again off again cough since before the pandemic"
09-04-2020T00:56:56,AspiringNoodle,"2, didn't they say Corona is a dry cough?"
09-04-2020T01:01:54,JojoGD,I wish my cat learned its lesson of not going outside when it‚Äôs dark
09-04-2020T01:02:10,JojoGD,Dam cat
09-04-2020T01:02:23,KeefMcDerpface,Speaking of cats...
09-04-2020T01:02:31,KeefMcDerpface,There's a lot in FF7.
09-04-2020T01:02:43,KeefMcDerpface,-_- But you can't pet them.
09-04-2020T01:03:48,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-shock:
09-04-2020T01:03:58,AspiringNoodle,Blizzard started adding animals in WoW that you could pet...
09-04-2020T01:04:07,AspiringNoodle,"In one zone, there's a small town with some corgis"
09-04-2020T01:04:07,JojoGD,:ptv-sad:
09-04-2020T01:04:12,AspiringNoodle,I always loved petting them~
09-04-2020T01:04:39,KeefMcDerpface,CORGIS?!
09-04-2020T01:04:42,AspiringNoodle,"Can't remember where they are in the current expansion, though..."

09-04-2020T01:55:13,CrimsonQuill,Good Friday today
09-04-2020T01:55:17,CrimsonQuill,So no sugar
09-04-2020T01:59:48,CrimsonQuill,Good Grief
09-04-2020T01:59:53,CrimsonQuill,Just seen Jojo's videos
09-04-2020T02:00:28,CrimsonQuill,I do not have the patience or skill to become that good at Geometry Dash
09-04-2020T02:13:24,AspiringNoodle,I'm just not willing to put in the time ;P
09-04-2020T02:13:35,AspiringNoodle,GD is a very particular skill
09-04-2020T02:13:44,CrimsonQuill,True that Aspiring
09-04-2020T02:13:55,CrimsonQuill,How's work at the moment by the way?
09-04-2020T02:14:00,CrimsonQuill,Still bad at the station?
09-04-2020T02:14:20,AspiringNoodle,Yes.  I was able to relax a smidge by visiting reddit and reading other retail worker's complaints :D
09-04-2020T02:14:29,AspiringNoodle,I still hate that all self-serve is up at the station :D
09-04-2020T02:14:29,CrimsonQuill,Aheheh
09-04-2020T02:14:45,CrimsonQuill,I suppose I must be thankful that my work isn't like that.
09-04-2020T02:14:48,AspiringNoodle,Our competitor 3 minutes away is closed for like another 1 - 1.5 weeks while they disinfect and await any other cases from staff
09-04-2020T02:14:57,AspiringNoodle,And they took way more measures than we did
09-04-2020T02:15:02,CrimsonQuill,UH. OH.
09-04-2020T02:15:20,AspiringNoodle,They installed plexiglass barriers to separate customer and employee
09-04-2020T02:15:25,AspiringNoodle,They shut down all self-serve
09-04-2020T02:15:26,CrimsonQuill,That is...a big fat DERP on the part of whoever runs your place
09-04-2020T02:15:40,CrimsonQuill,I went grocery shopping yesterday.
09-04-2020T02:15:52,AspiringNoodle,"So yeah, they're shut down, and we're seeing more customers because of it"
09-04-2020T02:15:52,CrimsonQuill,We all had to queue
09-04-2020T02:15:58,AspiringNoodle,Also that
09-04-2020T02:16:01,CrimsonQuill,Yep
09-04-2020T02:16:05,AspiringNoodle,No limit on how many people in the building
09-04-2020T02:16:12,CrimsonQuill,THAT.
09-04-2020T02:16:14,CrimsonQuill,IS.
09-04-2020T02:16:15,CrimsonQuill,STUPID.
09-04-2020T02:16:15,AspiringNoodle,"At once point I think we had 9 people in line, and it was 4 or 5 groups"
09-04-2020T02:16:30,AspiringNoodle,"We have social distancing markers, but it's still a bit ridiculous"
09-04-2020T02:16:39,CrimsonQuill,"When I went to the shops, people could only come in once someone else came out"
09-04-2020T02:16:45,AspiringNoodle,Also my parents don't seem to take this whole thing too seriously
09-04-2020T02:16:48,CrimsonQuill,There is a max. number of people to be in the biulding
09-04-2020T02:16:51,CrimsonQuill,It is serious
09-04-2020T02:17:01,CrimsonQuill,It might not be particularly deadly to some people
09-04-2020T02:17:03,AspiringNoodle,"So unless something happens to back me up, if I quit I'll just receive endless shit."
09-04-2020T02:17:07,CrimsonQuill,But for others it is VERY deadly
09-04-2020T02:17:30,CrimsonQuill,There are over 5000 cases in Ireland now.
09-04-2020T02:17:33,CrimsonQuill,5'000.
09-04-2020T02:17:39,CrimsonQuill,In just 2-3 weeks.
09-04-2020T02:17:42,AspiringNoodle,My state is approaching the 20k mark
09-04-2020T02:17:48,CrimsonQuill,Ouch.
09-04-2020T02:17:59,CrimsonQuill,How many in the state total population?
09-04-2020T02:18:10,CrimsonQuill,Because Ireland has 5000 among 5 million people
09-04-2020T02:18:14,AspiringNoodle,12.81M
09-04-2020T02:18:20,CrimsonQuill,Woah.
09-04-2020T02:18:22,CrimsonQuill,That is bad.
09-04-2020T02:18:32,AspiringNoodle,I found a reddit post that sums up what I'm seeing
09-04-2020T02:18:35,CrimsonQuill,About twice as dense as over here.
09-04-2020T02:18:41,CrimsonQuill,I found a few posts on it too
09-04-2020T02:20:01,AspiringNoodle,"Bleh, nvm, picture is miscaptioned"
09-04-2020T02:20:49,AspiringNoodle,"But unless the store is closed because someone tests positive, or a huge number of employees quit, I'll probably just get bitched at and / or get *talks* about being immature / irresponsible"
09-04-2020T02:21:26,AspiringNoodle,When not only has the workload become more and more unreasonable (because they keep adding tasks while stripping manpower) over the past few months
09-04-2020T02:21:36,AspiringNoodle,But my coworkers have more or less stopped trying to clean
09-04-2020T02:21:58,CrimsonQuill,Bad move to be honest
09-04-2020T02:22:00,AspiringNoodle,Or at the very least it appears that way
09-04-2020T02:22:03,CrimsonQuill,Cleaning is important
09-04-2020T02:22:04,CrimsonQuill,Heckll
09-04-2020T02:22:12,CrimsonQuill,When I get back to work after holiday
09-04-2020T02:22:21,CrimsonQuill,I will probably be wearing a facemask in kitchen
09-04-2020T02:22:37,CrimsonQuill,And it says we have to have our tempeeratures checkes twice a day there
09-04-2020T02:22:45,AspiringNoodle,HA
09-04-2020T02:22:51,CrimsonQuill,A text came saying at least one resident in the house has the VFirus
09-04-2020T02:22:59,CrimsonQuill,Thank God I wasn't the one who brought it in
09-04-2020T02:23:15,CrimsonQuill,I was isolating at the time. Still need to get my isolation benefit dammit...
09-04-2020T02:23:37,AspiringNoodle,"Gas station: No customer count limit, self-serve up, gloves not required, masks not required, further reduced manpower when extensive sanitization routine was added"
09-04-2020T02:23:46,CrimsonQuill,Aheheh
09-04-2020T02:23:50,CrimsonQuill,That is bad
09-04-2020T02:24:45,AspiringNoodle,"The reason why it's extremely stupid is because my father is T2 diabetic, is a smoker for decades, and he's mid 50's or later.  I can't remember how old my parents are."
09-04-2020T02:25:12,CrimsonQuill,I see
09-04-2020T02:25:23,AspiringNoodle,"So if I get sick, he's probably fucked on multiple levels, especially given some of the other medical issues he's had over recent years"
09-04-2020T02:25:34,AspiringNoodle,Yet neither of them show any concern that I'm actively working at the moment.
09-04-2020T02:25:46,CrimsonQuill,My sister has Asthma.
09-04-2020T02:25:53,CrimsonQuill,"If she gets it, she's gone."
09-04-2020T02:26:36,CrimsonQuill,"And your parents aren't concerned that any day some customer could unwittingly give you Covid-19, causing a runaway train progression that leads to their demise?"
09-04-2020T02:26:45,AspiringNoodle,"Mmmmm, nope"
09-04-2020T02:27:12,AspiringNoodle,"Had a discussion earlier about the lack of cleaning I saw on Wednesday, and my mother basically responded with ""You're right to be angry [but suck it up and deal with it]"""
09-04-2020T02:28:05,CrimsonQuill,"This is not a case where you can say ""suck it up and deal with it"" about poor hygiene."
09-04-2020T02:28:44,AspiringNoodle,"So, I get the feeling that unless I get sick, then one of them gets sick (and is either hospitalized or dies), they won't treat this whole thing with the respect it deserves"
09-04-2020T02:28:56,AspiringNoodle,Which also seems to be the kind of attitude I see from people in the store every day
09-04-2020T02:29:19,AspiringNoodle,I'm tired of seniors coming into the store to only play lottery
09-04-2020T02:29:39,AspiringNoodle,"And it's not just one round, they'll come up, buy a few tickets (or a bunch), play them, come back to redeem the winnings, and then play some more."
09-04-2020T02:29:45,CrimsonQuill,"Over here, we are given seven conditions on which we may go out."
09-04-2020T02:29:59,CrimsonQuill,"And I think the lottery might not be happening here, not sure"
09-04-2020T02:30:16,CrimsonQuill,"But generally people come to the grocery shop just to...get groceries, really."
09-04-2020T02:31:04,CrimsonQuill,"Yesterday, I got some fresh bread, some ham slices, chicken breast, butter, milk, potatoes, oranges and orange juice."
09-04-2020T02:31:16,CrimsonQuill,I was surprised at how full my bag was.
09-04-2020T02:31:20,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, and cabbage"
09-04-2020T02:31:51,AspiringNoodle,https://www.inquirer.com/health/coronavirus/coronavirus-covid-19-pa-new-jersey-cases-flattening-manufacturer-supplies-shortage-20200407.html
09-04-2020T02:32:03,AspiringNoodle,There's a graph showing the PA infection rate (home state)
09-04-2020T02:33:12,AspiringNoodle,I'm just irritated because this is America
09-04-2020T02:33:25,AspiringNoodle,"If you give people freedom to do something, they will do it.  and they'll test the limits while they're at it"
09-04-2020T02:33:39,CrimsonQuill,"Well as long as people are sensible, the rate should slow down and stop."
09-04-2020T02:33:46,AspiringNoodle,Just because we're open does NOT mean you should come in and buy a single pack of gum.  Doesn't matter if you were already out or not.
09-04-2020T02:33:52,CrimsonQuill,"But then again, when has the human race been sensible?"
09-04-2020T02:34:06,AspiringNoodle,"Same goes with self-serve and what not.  Also, we seem to be doing the OPPOSITE of shutting down self-serve"
09-04-2020T02:34:14,AspiringNoodle,Now my store is offering free coffee to healthcare workers
09-04-2020T02:34:30,CrimsonQuill,I can understand that for Healthcare workers
09-04-2020T02:34:41,CrimsonQuill,Because over here they are approaching a limit
09-04-2020T02:34:50,AspiringNoodle,The problem is that our coffee setup is pretty costly in time
09-04-2020T02:34:53,CrimsonQuill,But I can imagine that it causes more problems
09-04-2020T02:34:55,CrimsonQuill,Ah
09-04-2020T02:34:57,CrimsonQuill,There we go
09-04-2020T02:35:01,AspiringNoodle,To keep coffee fresh is 20 - 30 minutes of work every 2 hours
09-04-2020T02:35:20,AspiringNoodle,Meanwhile sanitization can take around 45 minutes
09-04-2020T02:35:22,CrimsonQuill,Yowch. That'll eat into your shift time.
09-04-2020T02:35:46,AspiringNoodle,I think I'm more or less accepting that I will spend all shift doing one of 4 things
09-04-2020T02:35:57,AspiringNoodle,"Emptying trash, sanitizing, changing coffee, stocking the cooler"
09-04-2020T02:36:09,AspiringNoodle,And I will not give 2 shits about anything else on the checklist
09-04-2020T02:36:19,CrimsonQuill,Remind me again
09-04-2020T02:36:41,CrimsonQuill,Why is your checklist and schedule so screwed up
09-04-2020T02:36:51,CrimsonQuill,And why are the people in charge so screwed up
09-04-2020T02:36:54,CrimsonQuill,Not the manager
09-04-2020T02:37:00,CrimsonQuill,But the toffs above
09-04-2020T02:37:12,AspiringNoodle,"Dunno, about a year ago our chain (and several others by the same parent company) were bought out by a different company"
09-04-2020T02:37:22,AspiringNoodle,"EG America, the US branch of a EU company"
09-04-2020T02:37:52,AspiringNoodle,Not only was the transition a complete mess (rewards / loyalty cards were down for half a year)
09-04-2020T02:38:03,AspiringNoodle,We remained open while undergoing a remodel
09-04-2020T02:38:20,AspiringNoodle,"We had our sales system updated, and resulted in large amounts of items not ringing up at all for weeks"
09-04-2020T02:38:23,SonOfGoku,How big was the remodel?
09-04-2020T02:38:40,AspiringNoodle,Pretty
09-04-2020T02:39:14,AspiringNoodle,"They had to tear out the original island the coffee bar was on, build a new one off to the side a bit as well as add seating, and shrunk down the freezer to free up room for the cooler so we could make room for beer"
09-04-2020T02:39:29,AspiringNoodle,Took 4 - 5 weeks.
09-04-2020T02:39:55,CrimsonQuill,Urrrgh
09-04-2020T02:39:57,AspiringNoodle,"But in the past 3 months or so, they've been updating the way things are done around the store."
09-04-2020T02:40:07,CrimsonQuill,Do you think it will improve?
09-04-2020T02:40:35,AspiringNoodle,"I won't complain too much about that.  They updated our tasks, which meant adding some new ones, consolidating some old ones, and outright removing some others"
09-04-2020T02:40:48,AspiringNoodle,The only downside is that it added a lot of busywork
09-04-2020T02:41:11,AspiringNoodle,"No telling.  Because the busy work is eating up more time since it needs to be done, without fail, every day, every shift, at set times"
09-04-2020T02:41:42,CrimsonQuill,"'Busywork: Noun-Work that keeps a person busy but is useless in itself"""
09-04-2020T02:41:46,AspiringNoodle,All the while they've stripped more hours away from the store.
09-04-2020T02:42:02,CrimsonQuill,I would more count that as the raw essentials of work
09-04-2020T02:42:03,AspiringNoodle,"And then when they added in the covid stuff, they stripped even more"
09-04-2020T02:42:14,CrimsonQuill,You really need more people to help
09-04-2020T02:42:23,AspiringNoodle,Exactly
09-04-2020T02:42:39,AspiringNoodle,"And if our manager starts getting on people's cases about certain tasks not being done, I can see people quitting"
09-04-2020T02:42:51,AspiringNoodle,And that might start a chain reaction
09-04-2020T02:42:59,AspiringNoodle,"If he calls me out, I'm gonna be blunt."
09-04-2020T02:43:22,CrimsonQuill,Blunt but not rude I hope
09-04-2020T02:43:32,CrimsonQuill,Because you said that the manager has a lot to deal with too
09-04-2020T02:43:49,AspiringNoodle,"Nope.  For example, on wednesday, I checked the list for morning shift's duties"
09-04-2020T02:43:59,AspiringNoodle,The cooler was marked as done.  That was a blatant lie.
09-04-2020T02:44:25,AspiringNoodle,"They likely only touched the soda / beer section, or they barely touched the milk / tea"
09-04-2020T02:44:35,CrimsonQuill,NOT. OKAY.
09-04-2020T02:44:48,CrimsonQuill,If I did that in the kitchen i would be reprimanded soon enough
09-04-2020T02:44:56,CrimsonQuill,Maybe even fired
09-04-2020T02:45:03,AspiringNoodle,The reason I say this is because one area of the cooler is dedicated to milk / tea / lemonades from our store brand
09-04-2020T02:45:26,CrimsonQuill,And that needs a deep clean?
09-04-2020T02:45:29,AspiringNoodle,"The shelves were barren, lots of empty spots, and so much had sold that anything remaining on the shelve was closer to the stocker side"
09-04-2020T02:45:36,CrimsonQuill,Ah
09-04-2020T02:45:39,CrimsonQuill,Empty shelves
09-04-2020T02:45:48,CrimsonQuill,Not a good thing for the end of a shift
09-04-2020T02:45:50,CrimsonQuill,Yeesh
09-04-2020T02:45:57,AspiringNoodle,"Yup, and on top of that, it was wednesday, which meant we had gotten a delivery that day"
09-04-2020T02:46:12,AspiringNoodle,"I go back to stock things, and all the old stuff was in the forward position, blocking the shelves"
09-04-2020T02:46:28,CrimsonQuill,Uuuuh
09-04-2020T02:46:30,CrimsonQuill,Bad
09-04-2020T02:46:43,AspiringNoodle,(We move the old stuff forward so the new stuff is against the back wall.  Makes it easier for us to stock since older stuff is closer to the shelves)
09-04-2020T02:47:08,AspiringNoodle,Some other pertinent info
09-04-2020T02:47:35,AspiringNoodle,"Each milk crate can hold either 4 gallon jugs, 9 half-gallon bottles, or 18 pints"
09-04-2020T02:48:26,AspiringNoodle,"By the time I finished restocking, I had put away, I wanna say 29 - 30ish crates worth of stuff?"
09-04-2020T02:48:44,AspiringNoodle,"And that also included digging around to know what was where, and moving crates so I could access stuff"
09-04-2020T02:48:44,CrimsonQuill,That is a great deal
09-04-2020T02:48:58,AspiringNoodle,And then Just consolidating / organizing stacks so it makes sense
09-04-2020T02:49:12,CrimsonQuill,120 gallons...
09-04-2020T02:49:27,AspiringNoodle,Cannot tell you how annoying it is when you have 2 stacks of product in the same row
09-04-2020T02:49:39,CrimsonQuill,Yowch.
09-04-2020T02:49:43,AspiringNoodle,And then you have to check what the dates are
09-04-2020T02:49:48,AspiringNoodle,And ultimate move them together
09-04-2020T02:49:58,CrimsonQuill,There was something like that in the kitchen once
09-04-2020T02:50:06,AspiringNoodle,But my shift more or less broke down like this
09-04-2020T02:50:09,AspiringNoodle,Arrive at 3
09-04-2020T02:50:14,CrimsonQuill,The milk used to make the custard was off just before the trolleys went off
09-04-2020T02:50:22,CrimsonQuill,So it had to be binned and made again
09-04-2020T02:50:23,AspiringNoodle,Clean store / some register duty until 5:30
09-04-2020T02:50:41,CrimsonQuill,This am or pm?
09-04-2020T02:50:46,AspiringNoodle,Coffee finished up ~6:15
09-04-2020T02:50:47,AspiringNoodle,pm
09-04-2020T02:50:58,AspiringNoodle,"Go to bathroom at some point, can't remember"
09-04-2020T02:50:59,CrimsonQuill,Ouch. And I thought I worked late
09-04-2020T02:51:16,AspiringNoodle,Cooler duty until around 8
09-04-2020T02:51:48,AspiringNoodle,Refresh coffee real quick
09-04-2020T02:52:18,AspiringNoodle,Get one last round of cleaning done around the store (the once every 2 hours routine) before the other guy leaves
09-04-2020T02:52:31,AspiringNoodle,"Finish up with that, other guy leaves store at 9"
09-04-2020T02:52:42,AspiringNoodle,Spend rest of shift continuing spot cleans
09-04-2020T02:52:50,AspiringNoodle,Cleaning out the old coffee pots
09-04-2020T02:53:01,AspiringNoodle,Serving customers (only person in the store at this point)
09-04-2020T02:53:27,AspiringNoodle,At 10 lock up so I can't serve anymore customers
09-04-2020T02:54:05,AspiringNoodle,"And I don't leave the store until after 11, because I needed to finish rinsing out the cleaned coffee pots, changing trash bags, signing off on all the things I did throughout the shift"
09-04-2020T02:54:15,CrimsonQuill,Nine hour shift.
09-04-2020T02:54:17,CrimsonQuill,Ouch.
09-04-2020T02:54:22,AspiringNoodle,And do the closing routine
09-04-2020T02:54:25,AspiringNoodle,"Nah, 8 hours"
09-04-2020T02:54:33,AspiringNoodle,But there's so much stuff I DIDN'T do
09-04-2020T02:54:34,CrimsonQuill,"Ah, my mistake."
09-04-2020T02:54:46,AspiringNoodle,I ONLY touched the milk / tea section of the cooler
09-04-2020T02:55:04,AspiringNoodle,Meaning I didn't touch bear / soda / sport drinks / brand name teas / coffees / wtf else do we have again?
09-04-2020T02:55:13,AspiringNoodle,didn't touch freezer
09-04-2020T02:55:26,AspiringNoodle,Didn't check fresh case for expired goods.  Didn't pull new stuff out to restock the case
09-04-2020T02:55:33,AspiringNoodle,Didn't front-face the store at all
09-04-2020T02:55:36,AspiringNoodle,Didn't sweep outside
09-04-2020T02:55:51,AspiringNoodle,Didn't sweep the store
09-04-2020T02:56:06,AspiringNoodle,Didn't clean the restroom (outside the specifics from the sanitization routine)
09-04-2020T02:56:14,AspiringNoodle,Didn't MOP the store
09-04-2020T02:56:24,AspiringNoodle,Didn't change a BIB for a soda thing that was out
09-04-2020T02:56:35,AspiringNoodle,Didn't change a creamer that I know was dated for that day
09-04-2020T02:56:56,CrimsonQuill,Tha...that's a lot that's not done...
09-04-2020T02:57:05,SonOfGoku,Isn't this a part time job?
09-04-2020T02:57:24,AspiringNoodle,Yes.  Yes it is.  But I only get schedule for full shifts 3 times a week :upside_down:
09-04-2020T02:57:39,AspiringNoodle,"Also, I was supposed to be out of the store at 10:30.  Lol"
09-04-2020T02:57:43,CrimsonQuill,Ahehe
09-04-2020T02:57:50,AspiringNoodle,I work today 2 - 9
09-04-2020T02:57:51,CrimsonQuill,Let me run through my schedule for you
09-04-2020T02:57:57,CrimsonQuill,OUCH
09-04-2020T02:57:58,AspiringNoodle,Tomorrow 2 - 10:30 (just WHY?!?)
09-04-2020T02:58:05,CrimsonQuill,....
09-04-2020T02:58:11,CrimsonQuill,Not nice
09-04-2020T02:58:20,AspiringNoodle,Yup
09-04-2020T02:58:23,CrimsonQuill,"11:45-Arrive, clock in, change"
09-04-2020T02:58:29,AspiringNoodle,"But cue my parents being the typical defenders of shitty jobs everywhere, lol"
09-04-2020T02:58:41,CrimsonQuill,"12:00-Shift begins, Wash dishes used to make Lunch"
09-04-2020T02:59:13,CrimsonQuill,"1:00pm finish (Or still be washing) dishes used to make lunch, clean out grease trap first time, fill big sinks for plates to come"
09-04-2020T02:59:57,CrimsonQuill,1:45pm Start going up to collect Trolleys (Although ATM They have to be brought down 'cause Covid)
09-04-2020T03:00:51,CrimsonQuill,"2:00-2:15pm Panic as I try to get soup and gravy into containers for cooks for later, put them in big sink, take any uneaten and unneeded food and bin it, pile dirty dishes up"
09-04-2020T03:01:48,CrimsonQuill,"2:15-4:00pm-Wash plates, Wash Bowls. Wash soup jugs. Wash dish covers and lids and dry dish covers after long time removing stickers. Clean Grease trap again. Start washing dishes that are used to make Dinner"
09-04-2020T03:02:07,CrimsonQuill,About 4:00-4:15-4:30pm Take 1/2 hour break for tea
09-04-2020T03:02:19,AspiringNoodle,"Lol, what is this ""break"" you speak of?"
09-04-2020T03:02:23,CrimsonQuill,"After Break, wash last few dishes used to make Dinner"
09-04-2020T03:02:33,CrimsonQuill,Sweep and mop floor
09-04-2020T03:02:37,CrimsonQuill,Clean Sliuce sink
09-04-2020T03:02:40,CrimsonQuill,Wash sinks
09-04-2020T03:02:47,CrimsonQuill,Make sinks not being used shiny
09-04-2020T03:03:14,CrimsonQuill,Wash Big dishwasher and drain and turn it off. Make sure small dishwasher works otherwise I'm effed
09-04-2020T03:03:33,CrimsonQuill,About 6:00pm: Bring down Dinner trolleys (or they come down)
09-04-2020T03:03:58,CrimsonQuill,6:00=6:30pm-Take unused stuff and either bin or keep
09-04-2020T03:04:03,CrimsonQuill,Empty trolleys
09-04-2020T03:04:31,CrimsonQuill,"(Oh, I have to disinfect everything too. Every day. Even before virus. Because, y'know, kitchen"
09-04-2020T03:04:37,AspiringNoodle,At least your workload seems reasonable!
09-04-2020T03:04:47,CrimsonQuill,6:30-7:00pm-wash dinner dishes
09-04-2020T03:05:01,AspiringNoodle,Did I ever tell you about the worst thing I found expired?  And this was relatively shortly after I got hired
09-04-2020T03:05:05,CrimsonQuill,7:00-7:30pm Wash and dry dish covers
09-04-2020T03:05:10,CrimsonQuill,"Yeah, it is reasonable"
09-04-2020T03:05:19,CrimsonQuill,Technically my shift ends at 7:30
09-04-2020T03:05:27,CrimsonQuill,But I always have a few things to finish up
09-04-2020T03:05:52,CrimsonQuill,7:30-8:00pm Wash and dry and shine last sinks. Change binbags. put everything away. Change. Clock out.
09-04-2020T03:06:03,CrimsonQuill,Food bins need emptying too
09-04-2020T03:06:10,CrimsonQuill,So what was the worst thing that expired?
09-04-2020T03:06:13,AspiringNoodle,"When I first got hired, it was apparent that they barely had enough manpower to get things done to a reasonable degree"
09-04-2020T03:06:31,AspiringNoodle,And that manpower has been stripped away constantly since then
09-04-2020T03:06:43,AspiringNoodle,But apparently the one area they failed in particular was checking expiration dates
09-04-2020T03:06:57,CrimsonQuill,I sense catastrophe.
09-04-2020T03:07:16,AspiringNoodle,"As I started checking dates one day, I started finding stuff that was a few weeks out of expiration"
09-04-2020T03:07:31,CrimsonQuill,Uh Oh
09-04-2020T03:07:31,AspiringNoodle,"It started with something that expired a week ago, no biggy"
09-04-2020T03:07:38,AspiringNoodle,Then 2 weeks
09-04-2020T03:07:41,AspiringNoodle,Then 2 months
09-04-2020T03:07:44,AspiringNoodle,Then 1 month
09-04-2020T03:07:46,AspiringNoodle,Then 3
09-04-2020T03:07:47,CrimsonQuill,arg
09-04-2020T03:07:49,AspiringNoodle,Then 6
09-04-2020T03:07:50,CrimsonQuill,ARGH
09-04-2020T03:08:03,AspiringNoodle,"Eventually, I found something that expired DEC 2017.  This was OCT 2019"
09-04-2020T03:08:05,CrimsonQuill,6 months?
09-04-2020T03:08:25,CrimsonQuill,THAT'S 2 YEARS.
09-04-2020T03:08:31,AspiringNoodle,Mmhmm
09-04-2020T03:08:36,CrimsonQuill,What was it?
09-04-2020T03:08:43,AspiringNoodle,Some sunflower seeds or something like that
09-04-2020T03:08:49,CrimsonQuill,Umm
09-04-2020T03:08:51,CrimsonQuill,Mould?
09-04-2020T03:08:56,AspiringNoodle,Not that I remember
09-04-2020T03:08:59,CrimsonQuill,Ah
09-04-2020T03:09:03,AspiringNoodle,The plastic packaging just looked very aged
09-04-2020T03:09:21,CrimsonQuill,That must have been a lot of stuff chcucked into the bin.
09-04-2020T03:09:22,AspiringNoodle,But it took me 4 shifts at multiple hours a piece to finally clear the store of all expired products
09-04-2020T03:09:37,CrimsonQuill,That...that is nasty.
09-04-2020T03:09:45,AspiringNoodle,"Probably at least 2 30 gallon bags worth (not a full 30 gallons a piece, but full enough that I'd tie it off)"
09-04-2020T03:10:16,CrimsonQuill,A lot of stuff.
09-04-2020T03:10:22,AspiringNoodle,"And like I said, since then corporate's only stripped away manpower available to the store each week and added more busywork to do"
09-04-2020T03:10:36,AspiringNoodle,So I regularly end up checking dates about once a month
09-04-2020T03:10:38,CrimsonQuill,Eff the corporate
09-04-2020T03:10:42,CrimsonQuill,If you ask me
09-04-2020T03:10:47,AspiringNoodle,"Ideally, it would be once a week"
09-04-2020T03:10:59,AspiringNoodle,We could let something slide by its expiration date by a few days
09-04-2020T03:10:59,CrimsonQuill,Yowcher.
09-04-2020T03:11:07,CrimsonQuill,Not good.
09-04-2020T03:11:08,CrimsonQuill,Aheheh
09-04-2020T03:11:12,CrimsonQuill,...
09-04-2020T03:11:34,CrimsonQuill,Anything else to talk about?
09-04-2020T03:11:41,AspiringNoodle,The bigger problem is that the store has some older employees on the roster
09-04-2020T03:12:00,CrimsonQuill,I assume those employees are no longer there?
09-04-2020T03:12:03,AspiringNoodle,Me and 1 other guy are mid-20-somethings who are by fair definition vets at the store
09-04-2020T03:12:07,AspiringNoodle,"Oh no, they're still working"
09-04-2020T03:12:07,CrimsonQuill,Or just not able for the job
09-04-2020T03:12:23,AspiringNoodle,It's just that they're not going to be able to do as much as us younger employees
09-04-2020T03:12:27,AspiringNoodle,But they still fill up a slot
09-04-2020T03:12:37,CrimsonQuill,Overworked and underpaid
09-04-2020T03:12:51,CrimsonQuill,While the bastards at the top line their pockets
09-04-2020T03:12:55,AspiringNoodle,"On wednesday, I left an older gentleman to man the register for most of the 6 hours we worked together"
09-04-2020T03:13:05,AspiringNoodle,So the older guy is the one dealing with all the customers
09-04-2020T03:13:15,AspiringNoodle,But I'm the young guy hauling ass and trying to do as much as possible with no breaks
09-04-2020T03:13:20,CrimsonQuill,And you were out doing the cleaning
09-04-2020T03:13:28,CrimsonQuill,Sometimes I skip breaks
09-04-2020T03:13:29,AspiringNoodle,"Yup.  Cleaning, stocking, trash"
09-04-2020T03:13:39,AspiringNoodle,I haven't taken an actual break in probably months
09-04-2020T03:13:39,CrimsonQuill,Because I don't want to have everything unfinished
09-04-2020T03:13:49,CrimsonQuill,Compared to you
09-04-2020T03:13:54,AspiringNoodle,"The only ""breaks"" I get these days are to use the bathroom"
09-04-2020T03:13:54,CrimsonQuill,I have it very reasonably./
09-04-2020T03:13:59,CrimsonQuill,...
09-04-2020T03:14:02,CrimsonQuill,I feel terrible.
09-04-2020T03:14:05,AspiringNoodle,Or when I man the register so they can use the restroom
09-04-2020T03:14:09,AspiringNoodle,Or take a smoke break
09-04-2020T03:14:12,AspiringNoodle,Or get something to eat
09-04-2020T03:14:14,CrimsonQuill,I don't smoke.
09-04-2020T03:14:18,CrimsonQuill,Never will.
09-04-2020T03:14:30,AspiringNoodle,"So if my coworker ends up taking a smoke or meal break, that's even less I get done"
09-04-2020T03:14:37,CrimsonQuill,"My parents used to years ago, but one of my earliest ever memories is them quitting."
09-04-2020T03:14:37,AspiringNoodle,And I refuse to sugarcoat the checklist
09-04-2020T03:14:50,AspiringNoodle,"If I don't get something done, it doesn't get done"
09-04-2020T03:14:56,CrimsonQuill,Sugarcoating is the enemy of efficiency and accountability
09-04-2020T03:15:03,AspiringNoodle,"I'm not gonna initial off a task, and then it clearly not be done like what happened on wednesday"
09-04-2020T03:15:25,AspiringNoodle,So it comes down to two things
09-04-2020T03:15:32,AspiringNoodle,Either you talk to corporate
09-04-2020T03:15:43,AspiringNoodle,Because I'm doing things BY. THE. BOOK.  Not taking shortcuts
09-04-2020T03:16:02,AspiringNoodle,"I'm not making extra coffee and leaving it up for 4 or 6 hours, it's getting done every 2.  Once they start blinking, they're changed"
09-04-2020T03:16:19,AspiringNoodle,"And when that's finished, I start cleaning because that's a reliable timer"
09-04-2020T03:16:32,AspiringNoodle,Or you reprimand me for not getting things done
09-04-2020T03:16:34,AspiringNoodle,At which point I quit
09-04-2020T03:17:07,CrimsonQuill,Because there is only so much s@!* you can take
09-04-2020T03:17:21,CrimsonQuill,Still no luck with other careers?
09-04-2020T03:17:28,AspiringNoodle,I haven't even bothered looking
09-04-2020T03:17:37,AspiringNoodle,"I doubt anything but ""essential"" is hiring atm"
09-04-2020T03:17:46,CrimsonQuill,Well once this is over
09-04-2020T03:17:52,AspiringNoodle,Then I kick into high gear
09-04-2020T03:17:53,CrimsonQuill,My advice is you start looking
09-04-2020T03:18:02,CrimsonQuill,When the whole thing is over
09-04-2020T03:18:11,CrimsonQuill,Send out CVs
09-04-2020T03:18:26,CrimsonQuill,Try to find stuff that you qualified for...was it coding?
09-04-2020T03:18:30,AspiringNoodle,Yes
09-04-2020T03:18:35,CrimsonQuill,Try that
09-04-2020T03:18:37,CrimsonQuill,Programming
09-04-2020T03:18:40,CrimsonQuill,And whatnot
09-04-2020T03:18:57,CrimsonQuill,At the moment I'm using the year to work in the kitchen
09-04-2020T03:19:09,CrimsonQuill,But next year i am scouting for surveying experience
09-04-2020T03:19:16,CrimsonQuill,Especially since there is work placement
09-04-2020T03:19:28,CrimsonQuill,"Heck, I admit this is kind of a breather year for me"
09-04-2020T03:19:51,CrimsonQuill,A year that I'm trying to use to pull myself together after last year's mess.
09-04-2020T03:19:55,CrimsonQuill,Break old bad habits
09-04-2020T03:20:02,CrimsonQuill,Re-assert study habits
09-04-2020T03:20:10,CrimsonQuill,Get work experience in the big bad world
09-04-2020T03:20:17,CrimsonQuill,Sort out my mental issues
09-04-2020T03:20:27,AspiringNoodle,Kinda wish Kiwi was here...
09-04-2020T03:20:31,CrimsonQuill,Me too
09-04-2020T03:20:41,CrimsonQuill,I want to talk to them about the cat video i found
09-04-2020T03:20:56,AspiringNoodle,She said something about this job being shitty.  That's why it's called a job
09-04-2020T03:21:09,AspiringNoodle,I won't deny that she's right
09-04-2020T03:21:37,AspiringNoodle,But I feel like the context missing is that the job has been degrading over the months I've been employed.  And it doesn't seem like it's going to turn around anytime soon.
09-04-2020T03:21:56,CrimsonQuill,As soon as you can
09-04-2020T03:21:59,AspiringNoodle,"And given the current pandemic, the store is in an unexcusable state."
09-04-2020T03:21:59,CrimsonQuill,Find something better
09-04-2020T03:22:08,CrimsonQuill,Agreed on that front.
09-04-2020T03:22:15,CrimsonQuill,There should be tighter regulations.
09-04-2020T03:22:22,AspiringNoodle,"I've already told my mother, ""Don't buy anything from where I work."""
09-04-2020T03:22:32,AspiringNoodle,Not sure if she'll take it to heart or spread it around
09-04-2020T03:23:19,AspiringNoodle,"Well, I am sleepy noodle"
09-04-2020T03:23:58,AspiringNoodle,"Good night, isolated noodles.  Get better soon Daddo, if you read this."
09-04-2020T03:24:06,CrimsonQuill,Get some snoozes.
09-04-2020T03:24:10,CrimsonQuill,Dream of Sneps.

09-04-2020T03:24:17,AspiringNoodle,"ugh, I'm still sore..."
09-04-2020T03:24:21,AspiringNoodle,Today gonna be fun >_>
09-04-2020T03:24:28,CrimsonQuill,(I actually bought a giant plush snep from the zoo. Named her Adira
09-04-2020T03:24:44,AspiringNoodle,I have a plush baby seal from when I was younger
09-04-2020T03:24:50,AspiringNoodle,I threw away many a thing when I cleaned my room
09-04-2020T03:24:55,CrimsonQuill,Awww
09-04-2020T03:24:58,AspiringNoodle,But I held onto it.  It's too cute
09-04-2020T03:24:59,CrimsonQuill,Why?
09-04-2020T03:25:04,CrimsonQuill,Ah good
09-04-2020T03:25:12,CrimsonQuill,Never throw away that sort of thing
09-04-2020T03:25:21,CrimsonQuill,I have a toy lion I named Fingajar.
09-04-2020T03:25:28,AspiringNoodle,He's chilling on some boxes of books next to my bed that I still need to get rid of
09-04-2020T03:25:29,CrimsonQuill,He's been with me since I was born
09-04-2020T03:25:47,CrimsonQuill,My mum's patched him up a few times over the years.
09-04-2020T03:26:01,CrimsonQuill,Right now he has a bit of sofa cover fabric on his front
09-04-2020T03:26:17,CrimsonQuill,With a big 'F' sewn on with scrap fabric
09-04-2020T03:26:31,CrimsonQuill,I love him to bits. Always bring him with me now
09-04-2020T03:26:50,CrimsonQuill,And I have my talking Caboose doll from Rooster Teeth that I got last year
09-04-2020T03:27:05,AspiringNoodle,"Omg, just checked the Smithsonian zoo website"
09-04-2020T03:27:26,CrimsonQuill,Go on

09-04-2020T08:24:23,Twokinds,Day 2 no power. No stream tonight.
09-04-2020T08:25:24,iliar,Tom. I wonder how often you have problems and electricity.

09-04-2020T08:31:33,Twokinds,phone's at 25%
09-04-2020T08:32:46,iliar,"A few years ago, due to freezing rain, our village house was de-energized. The first thing we did was buy a generator."
09-04-2020T08:33:05,iliar,Although since then I have never used it.
09-04-2020T08:33:41,iliar,"I thought, if this happens often with you, then it may make sense to buy it too."
09-04-2020T08:35:20,Twokinds,It would be handy right about now. I'll have to look into it.
09-04-2020T08:41:20,iliar,"Without electricity, are you taking a break from drawing? Or taking ordinary pencils and still try to draw something?"
09-04-2020T08:48:07,Twokinds,I'm trying to draw on paper
09-04-2020T09:23:20,JojoGD,Hi tom
09-04-2020T10:11:46,CrRAR,"Wow, 2 days no power is no joke. Generators though typically are wired for essential lights, lots of times to power all the luxuries you need an expensive one that sucks lots of fuel."
09-04-2020T10:13:42,CrRAR,Like I‚Äôm pretty sure the basic ones you can use a few lights and a few outlets but limited power. Like in Apollo 13 they have to balance what things can run on limited power to get the astronauts home xD
09-04-2020T10:16:49,CrimsonQuill,Hi guys
09-04-2020T10:16:51,CrimsonQuill,Hi Tom
09-04-2020T10:17:04,CrimsonQuill,What caused the power knockout?

09-04-2020T20:31:08,LopernicusMaximus,"I guess my biggest question to anyone who can answer it, are what are the various clans, and what sort of roles are they known for?"
09-04-2020T20:31:40,Mihari,"There might be a list out there somewhere, but there is certainly no comprehensive list of what they are known for or do."
09-04-2020T20:32:28,Mihari,Even all the comics combined have only covered a handful of the crests themselves.
09-04-2020T20:32:31,LopernicusMaximus,"Drat! Well I have no ideea where to find a list fo justt he knwon clans, but if somoen is able to track them down. amnd can note them to me via Nikaro at FA I would apprecaite it"
09-04-2020T20:32:39,unsteddyphoenix,Drat

09-04-2020T20:36:39,Inscrutable,Las Lindas sometimes feels like a sequel to a comic I haven't read
09-04-2020T20:36:39,AspiringNoodle,Chalo is here?!? :ptv-excited:
09-04-2020T20:36:50,Chalodraws,:cchalodraws-MoraPicarto_Hi:

09-04-2020T20:37:17,Chalodraws,LL is like a side story of a bigger comic I never made. XD

09-04-2020T20:38:13,AspiringNoodle,Kimi is such a cutie~
09-04-2020T20:38:13,Nekonny,although I did do tina online
09-04-2020T20:38:20,Nekonny,it never got to be as long as CB
09-04-2020T20:38:29,AspiringNoodle,"And that's Yuki keeping us entertained, right?"
09-04-2020T20:40:28,LopernicusMaximus,Welp! Someday I'm going to have to get a commission from Chalo now! This confrims it! *Sage nods*

09-04-2020T20:42:49,LopernicusMaximus,"Now that I think abbout it, IU would LOVE to see a match between a an earth crest, like dudre who makes minos look tiny, and a fire crest fighter"
09-04-2020T20:43:52,LopernicusMaximus,Sorry for rambleing.
09-04-2020T20:47:27,Nekonny,"Well, every so often chalo does commission streams"
09-04-2020T20:47:33,Nekonny,you could make it happen
09-04-2020T20:48:59,Inscrutable,"""LL is like a side story of a bigger comic I never made. XD"" Ah, that explains it"
09-04-2020T20:49:30,Nekonny,"wait, explains what? ^^"""
09-04-2020T20:49:52,swedishkitsune,the Spanish Inquisition
09-04-2020T20:50:01,swedishkitsune,didnt expect that now did you
09-04-2020T20:50:03,swedishkitsune,:eyes:
09-04-2020T20:50:44,swedishkitsune,Mora is half Prime
09-04-2020T20:50:58,swedishkitsune,along with the hints of her fathe rbeing full prime and so on
09-04-2020T20:50:59,Nekonny,one must always expect the Spanish inquisition
09-04-2020T20:52:50,Inscrutable,"Explains why Las Lindas sometimes feels like the sequel to another story, what with all the background stuff Minos and Geeku and Ambar were up to and now they're semi-retired-ish"
09-04-2020T20:52:56,swedishkitsune,^^^^^
09-04-2020T20:53:26,swedishkitsune,"in a plottwist though, BatB is the main storyline and all others are omake comics"
09-04-2020T20:53:40,swedishkitsune,"you can believe me, Im a guy on the internet"

09-04-2020T21:07:02,Nekonny,me being slow causing confusion
09-04-2020T21:07:13,SageSaga,i dont think that was the confusion
09-04-2020T21:07:18,Chalodraws,Tila is over 9 feet tall
09-04-2020T21:07:24,swedishkitsune,elipse?
09-04-2020T21:07:39,swedishkitsune,my english is good but not that good
09-04-2020T21:07:41,ZRO4825,"That's what I thought, Chalo. Cuz I know she's always towered over everyone else, lol."
09-04-2020T21:07:51,SageSaga,ellipses is the '. . .'

09-04-2020T21:09:25,swedishkitsune,I have no idea what that means. honest
09-04-2020T21:09:46,Nekonny,"they show that a character may be speachless, btut they do have thoughts on the current situation"
09-04-2020T21:09:51,Nekonny,some things go without being said

09-04-2020T21:11:02,Grip,Hello all :)
09-04-2020T21:11:05,SageSaga,think of it as a thoughtful pause

09-04-2020T21:11:16,swedishkitsune,:ok_hand:
09-04-2020T21:11:28,SageSaga,yo grip
09-04-2020T21:11:33,swedishkitsune,o/
09-04-2020T21:11:35,BlackjackSec99,I do that a lot... Kind of one of my bad habits
09-04-2020T21:12:22,Grip,"Had a pretty great day yesterday and today. At work got a great Eval from my boss and got a 4% raise, and today got something neat and works wonderfully."
09-04-2020T21:12:35,BlackjackSec99,Nice!
09-04-2020T21:12:36,Nekonny,"the peanuts comic, for example, ended every sentence in the entire with elipses (unless a ? or ! was used)"
09-04-2020T21:12:39,SageSaga,nice
09-04-2020T21:12:47,Nekonny,*entire series
09-04-2020T21:12:50,Grip,Making $19.22 an hour now.
09-04-2020T21:13:03,AspiringNoodle,Nice
09-04-2020T21:13:28,BlackjackSec99,I make $12 which is nearly minimum wage here... downsides to family businesses
09-04-2020T21:13:38,AspiringNoodle,$11.50 because hazard pay :D
09-04-2020T21:14:14,Grip,Work in Hospital in the IT department.
09-04-2020T21:14:16,ZRO4825,Still making minimum wage. Less while I'm on the road. Only reason I make more is tips and mileage.
09-04-2020T21:14:17,SageSaga,i make around 6 dollars an hour. . . sorta
09-04-2020T21:14:27,Nekonny,but 24/7?
09-04-2020T21:14:34,SageSaga,no
09-04-2020T21:14:44,Grip,Needs some hours to sleep.
09-04-2020T21:15:04,Nekonny,I'm a bit annoyed at my job; they advertise a salary range in the job description but give no raises
09-04-2020T21:15:30,BlackjackSec99,O.o thats bull... so whatever you are hired at is what it stays?
09-04-2020T21:15:41,Nekonny,pretty much
09-04-2020T21:15:44,Grip,That stinks. What do you do if you don't mind me asking?
09-04-2020T21:15:52,BlackjackSec99,That sucks
09-04-2020T21:15:52,Nekonny,IT as well
09-04-2020T21:15:55,AspiringNoodle,#YayHumanGreed
09-04-2020T21:16:41,Nekonny,"in fact, they reduced the salary"
09-04-2020T21:16:50,ZRO4825,For some reason I thought you were a teacher of some sort Nekonny. I'm curious why I thought that now. :thinking:
09-04-2020T21:17:04,BlackjackSec99,At least i can say my case isint one of greed. We simply cant afford to pay well because the store runs on fumes as it is :/
09-04-2020T21:17:04,SageSaga,because we have said he works at a school
09-04-2020T21:17:06,Nekonny,because they made us start contibuting an extra 3% of our salaries to cover retirement costs
09-04-2020T21:17:18,ZRO4825,"Yeah, guess that'd do it, lol"
09-04-2020T21:17:22,ZRO4825,"And oof, that sucks."
09-04-2020T21:17:32,Grip,Not good.
09-04-2020T21:18:06,SageSaga,doesnt that go to your retirement cost?
09-04-2020T21:18:14,BlackjackSec99,"MADE you? Ive got a voluntary 401k, but its not required..."
09-04-2020T21:18:29,Nekonny,it does
09-04-2020T21:18:39,Nekonny,but it was covered before and it is no longer
09-04-2020T21:18:49,BlackjackSec99,...wow
09-04-2020T21:18:56,Nekonny,and the retirement benifit stays the same
09-04-2020T21:19:23,Grip,What company do you work for Nekonny?
09-04-2020T21:19:31,Nekonny,when  I came back from my trip I was forced to stay on a 2 week quarantine... using my own sick time
09-04-2020T21:19:38,Grip,If I can ask that.
09-04-2020T21:19:39,Nekonny,while everyone else got to work from home
09-04-2020T21:19:52,Grip,That also really stinks.
09-04-2020T21:20:12,AspiringNoodle,I love how this pandemic is showing all the worst parts of the working world :ptv-hearts:
09-04-2020T21:20:13,Grip,Paid sick time?
09-04-2020T21:20:41,Grip,What I do I can't really work from home at all.
09-04-2020T21:21:13,Nekonny,I am not going to bother arguing it tho...
09-04-2020T21:21:48,Nekonny,don't want to run the risk of retaliation
09-04-2020T21:22:01,Grip,Sounds good.
09-04-2020T21:22:11,BlackjackSec99,Yeaahhhhh ive seen that happen first hand
09-04-2020T21:23:26,Nekonny,it's not even his money
09-04-2020T21:23:34,Ordithus,:csagesaga-c3: hello!
09-04-2020T21:23:41,BlackjackSec99,My friend started questioning policies and safety procedures a little too loudly and he was swept under the rug pretty quick... hes still trying to get a wrongful termination suit going
09-04-2020T21:23:42,AspiringNoodle,Herro Ord
09-04-2020T21:23:48,Nekonny,they may even be some silver lining in it
09-04-2020T21:23:52,BlackjackSec99,Hey Ord
09-04-2020T21:24:05,Nekonny,as I can't cash in on sick time anyway unless I work there till I retire
09-04-2020T21:24:35,Nekonny,and theres currently no limit on how much sick time I can acumulate
09-04-2020T21:24:54,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-ohmy:
09-04-2020T21:25:18,AspiringNoodle,*accumulates year of sick time* *retires*
09-04-2020T21:25:20,swedishkitsune,the US doctrine on sickdays are very hard for me to understand. getting a set number of days you may be sick on to use
09-04-2020T21:25:30,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-condescending:*[Time to pay up...]
09-04-2020T21:26:06,AspiringNoodle,One of the US's biggest faults is that we let unions go away
09-04-2020T21:26:11,Nekonny,"If you are ick and cant come into work, you still get paid"
09-04-2020T21:26:23,AspiringNoodle,And big corporations are hell bent on not letting unions start up ever again
09-04-2020T21:26:25,swedishkitsune,we get 80% sickpay
09-04-2020T21:26:25,Nekonny,but only to a certain amount.
09-04-2020T21:26:29,Kynum,sup
09-04-2020T21:26:41,AspiringNoodle,"Yooooo, Kynum :D"
09-04-2020T21:26:50,Nekonny,and that amount is very limited; only up to 12 days a year
09-04-2020T21:27:29,AspiringNoodle,*never gets sick* *works 30 years* *...* *profit?*
09-04-2020T21:27:44,Nekonny,yes
09-04-2020T21:27:57,swedishkitsune,I have maybe been away from work for 12 days in the last 9 years
09-04-2020T21:28:00,Nekonny,A friend of mine has completed 30 years
09-04-2020T21:28:08,Nekonny,and has over a year of sick time acumulated
09-04-2020T21:28:11,swedishkitsune,"when I have been like ""damn I have fever and/or flu"""
09-04-2020T21:28:50,Nekonny,"so, when he does retire, he gets all that at his final salary range"
09-04-2020T21:29:17,CrRAR,legit
09-04-2020T21:29:31,Nekonny,but only if you retire there
09-04-2020T21:29:50,swedishkitsune,"I gotta go now, its like 4:30am here in IKEA land"
09-04-2020T21:30:00,swedishkitsune,thanks for the stream everyone and have a nice night
09-04-2020T21:30:03,CrRAR,just gotta stay employed there forever and ever
09-04-2020T21:30:05,Ordithus,bye sk
09-04-2020T21:30:09,BlackjackSec99,You too!
09-04-2020T21:30:19,Nekonny,cya!
09-04-2020T21:30:34,Kynum,"later, Kitsune"
09-04-2020T21:30:39,CrRAR,Yeah there were literally no rules to benefits if you joined the workforce early enough
09-04-2020T21:30:57,CrRAR,They didn't even have the concept of being stingy back then
09-04-2020T21:31:21,Nekonny,they way I see it
09-04-2020T21:32:00,Nekonny,the new boss has to come up with ways to make even more profit than the guy before him to make an impression
09-04-2020T21:32:27,Nekonny,so ech new generation has to be more stingy than the past in order to be considered sucessfull
09-04-2020T21:32:28,CrRAR,"yup, cascade of crazy"
09-04-2020T21:32:44,AspiringNoodle,Essentially the problem with modern capitalism
09-04-2020T21:32:49,AspiringNoodle,There isn't much more room to grow
09-04-2020T21:32:57,AspiringNoodle,So the only way to obtain more is to take from others
09-04-2020T21:33:08,CrRAR,Gonna have to figure out a new way to reward people pretty soon
09-04-2020T21:33:19,AspiringNoodle,Or perhaps just rework priorities
09-04-2020T21:33:33,Nekonny,its the expectation of unlimited growth thats wrong
09-04-2020T21:33:37,AspiringNoodle,"Instead of sustained, indefinite growth.  Why not focus on long-term viability"
09-04-2020T21:33:48,AspiringNoodle,That's the only way to end the cycle
09-04-2020T21:33:49,Nekonny,grow or die will inevitably lead to well... death
09-04-2020T21:34:03,AspiringNoodle,"Nekonny, I see we agree ;)"
09-04-2020T21:34:15,ZRO4825,"Good luck convincing stockholders and investors of that though, sadly."
09-04-2020T21:34:17,Nekonny,everyone is focused on instant gratification
09-04-2020T21:34:18,AspiringNoodle,"Modern business: ""We no longer care about making a lot of money, now we must make ALL THE MONEY!!!"""
09-04-2020T21:34:23,Nekonny,get rich quick

09-04-2020T21:34:40,Ordithus,Was there a start to this topic of conversation?
09-04-2020T21:34:44,ZRO4825,"I agree, Noodle."
09-04-2020T21:34:45,Nekonny,yeah

09-04-2020T21:34:56,Nekonny,old lady here needs a name
09-04-2020T21:35:00,Ordithus,I was just curious how it came up
09-04-2020T21:35:05,ZRO4825,Toyoko is best android lady.
09-04-2020T21:35:31,Zoamelgustar,How about
09-04-2020T21:35:35,Zoamelgustar,Hortence
09-04-2020T21:35:40,Nekonny,What About Shu?
09-04-2020T21:35:46,Kynum,ZOAMELGUSTAR!

09-04-2020T21:36:02,Nekonny,tho that isnt an androd
09-04-2020T21:36:07,Nekonny,whats the diffrence again?
09-04-2020T21:36:17,Inscrutable,Old Lady Witherbee
09-04-2020T21:36:27,SageSaga,who is Shu again?
09-04-2020T21:36:33,ZRO4825,"I mean, teeeechnically Toyoko wouldn't be an android anwyay, she'd be a gynoid. :thinking:"
09-04-2020T21:36:50,SageSaga,dont pull that crap
09-04-2020T21:36:58,ZRO4825,O.o
09-04-2020T21:37:04,Nekonny,green haired girl on my screen
09-04-2020T21:37:08,ZRO4825,Isn't that technically the term?
09-04-2020T21:37:13,SageSaga,no
09-04-2020T21:37:22,Zoamelgustar,It is
09-04-2020T21:37:24,SageSaga,because you are correcting something that isnt incorrect
09-04-2020T21:37:46,ZRO4825,If you say so. ^^;
09-04-2020T21:38:15,Davoerlo,Morning all
09-04-2020T21:38:15,SageSaga,"its not if i say so - holy crap how many times do i have to correct people on this- Android means humanoid robot- not ""male Robot"""
09-04-2020T21:38:37,Nekonny,what?
09-04-2020T21:38:50,Nekonny,how did that even become a thing?
09-04-2020T21:38:52,SageSaga,"Gynoid is used to just mean female robot- however it's also used for sexbot, fembot, prostitution robot"
09-04-2020T21:39:03,ZRO4825,"okay, fuck, didn't mean to start a hot button topic, I've literally never even known it to come up before while I was paying attention."
09-04-2020T21:39:14,Nekonny,heya davo
09-04-2020T21:39:19,Zoamelgustar,The andr prefix is masculine
09-04-2020T21:39:21,SageSaga,because people look at the root of andro and know it means Man
09-04-2020T21:39:25,Ordithus,I can see why you would dislike that term
09-04-2020T21:39:34,Nekonny,news to me
09-04-2020T21:39:37,Zoamelgustar,Take it up with the Greeks'
09-04-2020T21:39:49,SageSaga,but the creation of the term android was not meant to be masculine
09-04-2020T21:39:58,SageSaga,the greeks didnt come up with the name android
09-04-2020T21:40:11,CrRAR,"Church: ""Yes... Caboose... I'm a gay robot."""
09-04-2020T21:40:35,BlackjackSec99,:cblackjacksec99-emote1:
09-04-2020T21:40:46,Davoerlo,Nekkonny what are the chances of getting Yuki cosplaying as Jessie from the ff7 remake?
09-04-2020T21:41:17,SageSaga,ive practically written essays on this because its really annoying having some person trying to be smart correcting my use of the term android when it's not wrong
09-04-2020T21:41:32,AspiringNoodle,Just scrolled back up <3
09-04-2020T21:41:36,Nekonny,pretty good Davo XD
09-04-2020T21:41:46,Davoerlo,yay
09-04-2020T21:41:48,AspiringNoodle,Yes Phil!  Somebody who appreciates what an android actually is >w<
09-04-2020T21:42:17,Davoerlo,been playing it the last 24 hours and loving the remake
09-04-2020T21:42:36,Zoamelgustar,"No one is trying to be a smartass, they're using the term the way the root words imply"
09-04-2020T21:42:48,SageSaga,the root word is not applicable
09-04-2020T21:42:51,Zoamelgustar,It's not something worth getting upset about
09-04-2020T21:42:53,Inscrutable,"Even if android meant male human looking robot exclusively, people have been using it to just mean human looking robot long enough that that'd be a new definition"
09-04-2020T21:42:56,SageSaga,it was not created by the greek
09-04-2020T21:42:57,Inscrutable,Language do that
09-04-2020T21:42:59,Nekonny,I was just asking what is an android
09-04-2020T21:43:02,SageSaga,it never meant male only
09-04-2020T21:43:07,Nekonny,google lookup is all about phones now
09-04-2020T21:43:08,AspiringNoodle,"To make it easy, I like pointing out Androids 16 - 18 from DBZ."
09-04-2020T21:43:16,SageSaga,andoid is a humanoid robot- regardless of gender
09-04-2020T21:43:33,AspiringNoodle,"2 male-based androids, 1 female"
09-04-2020T21:43:37,Nekonny,so the green haired girl is an android
09-04-2020T21:43:39,SageSaga,both android 17 and 18 are cyborgs though
09-04-2020T21:43:42,AspiringNoodle,All robots that appear to look like normal people
09-04-2020T21:44:03,ThoseButterflys,cool I learned about somthing I didnt ask about but is actualy realy interesting
09-04-2020T21:44:09,SageSaga,android 16 is an android
09-04-2020T21:44:14,CrRAR,"What Blade Runner is based on is ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" and replicants can be male or female soooooo"

09-04-2020T21:45:26,ThoseButterflys,An............ amazing conversation
09-04-2020T21:45:34,SageSaga,gynoids is so often used in reference to sex bots that i really dont like it used to describe my characters

09-04-2020T21:46:08,SageSaga,so its a double annoying thing for me- 1 being corrected when theres nothing to correct- and 2 associating my characters as sex toys

09-04-2020T22:17:44,AspiringNoodle,And so we've been receiving increased traffic as a result
09-04-2020T22:17:46,AspiringNoodle,Yay~
09-04-2020T22:18:20,SageSaga,so far we only have 12 cases in our area- but thats 12 now when it was 6... yesterday

09-04-2020T22:21:28,SageSaga,with the size of my county and the lack of testing 12 means we probably have a lot more

09-04-2020T22:36:39,SageSaga,"Ron is in trouble- think about it like this- if someone says ""is it ok for me to post a link?"" and someone says ""YES IT IS!"" they are the cause"
09-04-2020T22:36:43,FoxxTrotter,:shark:
09-04-2020T22:36:55,RimaDraws,hmm
09-04-2020T22:37:01,AspiringNoodle,"Sage, is it okay for me to lick a toilet?"

09-04-2020T22:52:03,LannAF,Looks awesome Ron!
09-04-2020T22:52:12,Nekonny,thanks ^^
09-04-2020T22:52:42,LannAF,I don't have the extension cables I need for my valve index :C
09-04-2020T22:52:51,Nekonny,Games been fun still
09-04-2020T22:52:54,LannAF,I wonder if any electronics stores are still open
09-04-2020T22:53:07,Nekonny,I do love the co operative team based gameplay
09-04-2020T22:53:14,LannAF,which game Ron?
09-04-2020T22:53:31,Nekonny,Sea of Thieves
09-04-2020T22:53:34,AspiringNoodle,Laaaaaaaann :ptv-excited:
09-04-2020T22:53:42,LannAF,Nooooooodle
09-04-2020T22:53:52,AspiringNoodle,Do I hear co-op gameplay in the works? c:
09-04-2020T22:53:59,Nekonny,no
09-04-2020T22:54:09,Nekonny,?
09-04-2020T22:54:16,Nekonny,not in the works XD
09-04-2020T22:54:25,Nekonny,unless I misunderstood your question
09-04-2020T22:54:31,RimaDraws,games sound fun
09-04-2020T22:54:41,AspiringNoodle,"I'm trying to quit WoW, lol"
09-04-2020T22:54:52,AspiringNoodle,So I would love to play a game that doesn't make me ragequit xD
09-04-2020T22:55:07,Nekonny,"Oh, It can happen in any game"
09-04-2020T22:55:17,AspiringNoodle,Even...GOAT SIMULATOR?!?
09-04-2020T22:55:25,Nekonny,A lot of times a single mistake can mean a total loss in SOT
09-04-2020T22:55:38,LannAF,Isn't SOT a game of literal pirating?
09-04-2020T22:55:42,AspiringNoodle,^
09-04-2020T22:55:47,LannAF,AKA You might lose everything all the time due to pvp?
09-04-2020T22:55:54,AspiringNoodle,"Yarr harr and fiddly dee, we sail the open seas!"
09-04-2020T22:56:10,BlackjackSec99,hehehehehe I know that song noodle
09-04-2020T22:56:28,AspiringNoodle,Do you know Diggy Diggy Hole? c:
09-04-2020T22:56:31,BlackjackSec99,YES
09-04-2020T22:56:41,Nekonny,"no, you do deliver your haul and acumulate cash and such"
09-04-2020T22:56:43,BlackjackSec99,Wind Rose perfected it
09-04-2020T22:57:21,AspiringNoodle,They are the only true hole diggers
09-04-2020T22:57:32,Nekonny,the game is skill based
09-04-2020T22:57:49,Nekonny,no pay to win elements
09-04-2020T22:57:51,LannAF,Ron look into Last Oasis
09-04-2020T22:57:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,^
09-04-2020T22:57:58,LannAF,A bunch of us are playing it :eyes:
09-04-2020T22:58:01,LannAF,Marv included.
09-04-2020T22:58:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,It's legit awesome
09-04-2020T22:58:07,LannAF,I'm apparently becoming the leader of a big clan now.
09-04-2020T22:58:21,Nekonny,looks it up
09-04-2020T22:58:32,LannAF,territory politics is interesting
09-04-2020T22:58:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Everyone united in one Oasis under one butt flag
09-04-2020T22:59:06,LannAF,We're not having a butt flag.
09-04-2020T22:59:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I cry
09-04-2020T22:59:36,LannAF,I love how we're basically security for smaller groups though.
09-04-2020T22:59:46,LannAF,COME HERE MY CHILDREN. I'LL PROTECT YOU.
09-04-2020T22:59:48,BlackjackSec99,:ctwokinds-KatDance::ctwokinds-FloDance:
09-04-2020T23:00:14,AspiringNoodle,That sounds like fun
09-04-2020T23:02:30,BlackjackSec99,"Nekonny, this audio.... <3 pringin back the memories"
09-04-2020T23:02:34,BlackjackSec99,bringing*
09-04-2020T23:07:25,Nekonny,hahah sorry ^^
09-04-2020T23:07:39,Nekonny,how does last oasis work?
09-04-2020T23:07:56,SageSaga,you install it and run it
09-04-2020T23:08:00,LannAF,pffft
09-04-2020T23:08:05,LannAF,You ever played Conan Exiles?
09-04-2020T23:08:16,funnyman42,~<3
09-04-2020T23:08:35,LannAF,"The premise is you're a bunch of travelling nomads, gather materials, unlock crafting stuff etc"
09-04-2020T23:08:44,LannAF,But you travel around using grapple hooks and walkers
09-04-2020T23:08:54,AspiringNoodle,Because the earth stopped spinning
09-04-2020T23:09:02,Nekonny,the shrt vid I watched made it seem like Rust?
09-04-2020T23:09:02,LannAF,Big mechanical wooden ships
09-04-2020T23:09:13,AspiringNoodle,"And so as the planet slowly revolves around the sun, the habitable area constantly changes"
09-04-2020T23:09:27,LannAF,"It doesn't play like Rust, or at least, it plays as similar to it as Tf2 and Call of duty"
09-04-2020T23:09:28,BlackjackSec99,CONAN! I recently strated with that one
09-04-2020T23:09:36,BlackjackSec99,started....
09-04-2020T23:09:43,LannAF,"If you've played Ark, it's kinda similar to that"
09-04-2020T23:09:46,LannAF,Moreso than Rust.
09-04-2020T23:09:53,LannAF,But it's VERY similar to conan
09-04-2020T23:10:05,LannAF,in terms of the gathering/crafting aspects.
09-04-2020T23:11:36,Nekonny,hum
09-04-2020T23:11:43,Nekonny,how long does a game last?
09-04-2020T23:11:53,LannAF,A game?
09-04-2020T23:12:00,LannAF,It's MMOish.
09-04-2020T23:12:13,BlackjackSec99,ish?
09-04-2020T23:12:13,LannAF,You travel to different oases which serve as different servers basically.
09-04-2020T23:12:23,Nekonny,ah
09-04-2020T23:12:48,LannAF,We've established our oasis as a friendly/peaceful one and try to defend people from hostiles from outside.
09-04-2020T23:12:49,Nekonny,i guess I would have to look at a few more vids to get a grasp of it
09-04-2020T23:14:24,SageSaga,i think a lot of the videos show a lot of PvP but in my experience you are more likely to die due to Lann than PvP
09-04-2020T23:14:48,BlackjackSec99,....lol
09-04-2020T23:14:51,Nekonny,XD
09-04-2020T23:14:54,Nekonny,poor lann
09-04-2020T23:14:55,Ordithus,PvLann

09-04-2020T23:15:19,AspiringNoodle,"Run, before Lann kills you with clumsiness!"
09-04-2020T23:15:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Lann learned how to be a human wrecking ball  and launched me off my boat at mach 50 nearly killing me
09-04-2020T23:15:59,SageSaga,lann cannot deny it in good faith
09-04-2020T23:16:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,3hp out of 136
09-04-2020T23:16:20,AspiringNoodle,Didn't reach escape velocity - 0/10
09-04-2020T23:20:34,Nekonny,I'm gonna watch a few more vids on it
09-04-2020T23:20:41,Nekonny,but for tonight... I'm done drawing
09-04-2020T23:20:48,Nekonny,too tired ^^

09-04-2020T23:28:26,LannAF,It was hilarious to knock marv away at lightspeed
09-04-2020T23:28:34,LannAF,and sage was just in the dangerzone
09-04-2020T23:28:38,Ordithus,I wasnt there and I'd agre
09-04-2020T23:28:40,Ordithus,agree
09-04-2020T23:28:45,BlackjackSec99,"its call Hootsforce, a bit of an acid trip of a music video"
09-04-2020T23:28:45,LannAF,anywhere in my vicinity is the danger zone.
09-04-2020T23:28:45,SageSaga,you killed me 3 times
09-04-2020T23:28:52,RimaDraws,ok

09-04-2020T23:30:13,AspiringNoodle,On the other hand
09-04-2020T23:30:17,SageSaga,to be fair guys- im sure the game doesnt have an escape velocity set
09-04-2020T23:30:23,AspiringNoodle,"You recreate the skyrim giant launch in Oasis, and I'll forgive you :)"
09-04-2020T23:30:33,AspiringNoodle,"It's simple, really"
09-04-2020T23:30:39,AspiringNoodle,Just hit him so hard that he NEVER comes down
09-04-2020T23:30:48,AspiringNoodle,And a GM or something has to reset his position / velocity xD
09-04-2020T23:31:44,LannAF,xD
09-04-2020T23:32:07,Chalodraws,I'll be going too. Thanks a lot for the invite!

09-04-2020T23:53:23,SageSaga,i started reading a new isekai book
09-04-2020T23:53:50,SageSaga,the plot is basically- what if a wizard from harry potter got pulled into an isekai with his 2 muggle friends
09-04-2020T23:54:39,SageSaga,"so its like ""Wow! Magic is real here!"" *haha you suckers dont know magic was real before anyways*"
09-04-2020T23:56:35,SageSaga,that actually sums up the book a lot actually- it's a pretty slow paced book it seems
