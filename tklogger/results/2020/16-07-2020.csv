16-07-2020T20:27:54,BadFoMo,Oh...
16-07-2020T20:28:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Oop
16-07-2020T20:28:38,K3IDRAN,I'm listening to King xf Kings by scarlxrd
16-07-2020T20:29:25,SageSaga,did someone ask?
16-07-2020T20:29:44,CrRAR,gonna be a no from me dawg
16-07-2020T20:29:50,yellowishcantelope,hey sage what is your favorite class in dnd?
16-07-2020T20:30:19,SageSaga,i dunno if i have a favorite but it would probably be a tie between Wizard and Warlock
16-07-2020T20:30:42,BadFoMo,There's a diffrence?
16-07-2020T20:30:52,CrRAR,"Warlocks have a cooler name, but Wizards are OG"
16-07-2020T20:30:55,SageSaga,"i really like Rogues, Wizards, Warlocks, Sorcerers, clerics and Fighters"
16-07-2020T20:31:03,SageSaga,there is a big difference
16-07-2020T20:31:19,SageSaga,a warlock is granted power by a patron
16-07-2020T20:31:24,LizardNettle,holy shit there is so much of a difference
16-07-2020T20:31:25,Werewing,"Yeah, the spell prereqs are pretty different."
16-07-2020T20:31:29,SageSaga,a wizard gains his power through study and application of magic
16-07-2020T20:31:42,CrRAR,w i s d o m
16-07-2020T20:31:43,Werewing,"How do you feel about Arcane Tricksters, Sage?"
16-07-2020T20:32:10,SageSaga,i like em a lot- Illusionists are some of my favorite but in 5e as rules written underpowered
16-07-2020T20:32:18,Werewing,"Wizards go for INT, Warlocks for CHA. I think, CrRAR."
16-07-2020T20:32:28,CrRAR,neat
16-07-2020T20:32:37,yellowishcantelope,ya they kind of suck until level 14 illusion wizard feature plus illusionary terrain spell
16-07-2020T20:32:41,CrRAR,"also correction, w i z d o m"
16-07-2020T20:32:49,LizardNettle,Arcane tricksters sound fun but ive never played one
16-07-2020T20:33:03,Werewing,"Sorry, I meant the magical archetype for Rogues, Sage. Sneaky and has spells are awesome, right?"
16-07-2020T20:33:03,yellowishcantelope,arcane tricksters are one of the most fun subclasses
16-07-2020T20:33:19,yellowishcantelope,stealing with magic tricks and shenanigans is always a good time
16-07-2020T20:33:35,LizardNettle,I think my fave class rn is artificer
16-07-2020T20:33:41,Werewing,I managed to spook pirates as my Halfling Arcane Trickster.
16-07-2020T20:33:41,SageSaga,"ive played about 6 different wizards, 10 different Rogues, 4 different Sorcerers, 5 different Warlocks-"
16-07-2020T20:33:56,SageSaga,ive only had maybe 4 clerics
16-07-2020T20:34:27,SageSaga,i think ive only played 1 bard
16-07-2020T20:34:41,SageSaga,"2 barbarians, 4 fighters-"
16-07-2020T20:34:48,SageSaga,5 monks- monks are fun
16-07-2020T20:34:55,Werewing,"Bards are fun, as long as the DMs don't force you to sing everything."
16-07-2020T20:34:56,SageSaga,2 rangers
16-07-2020T20:35:11,SageSaga,2 Paladins
16-07-2020T20:35:20,LizardNettle,thats a lot of chars
16-07-2020T20:35:39,Werewing,"Or actually learn an instrument. I've had a few that tried to enforce that, I don't think anyone took the class as a result."
16-07-2020T20:35:41,SageSaga,ive been playing D&D for a loooong time
16-07-2020T20:35:56,SageSaga,that DM is a dick Werewing
16-07-2020T20:36:24,Werewing,"DMs. None of the games lasted that long either, but that was more a scheduling problem."
16-07-2020T20:37:11,LizardNettle,scheduling is a bitch
16-07-2020T20:37:26,BadFoMo,Yep.
16-07-2020T20:37:47,LizardNettle,luckily group somehow manages to have a bunch of games running
16-07-2020T20:38:23,Combak,Is Tom not streaming again?
16-07-2020T20:38:37,Werewing,"Scheduling isn't actually that hard, you just need transparency. But no one wants to actually say the times they are available, they just keep giving super vague statements."
16-07-2020T20:38:40,BadFoMo,Unknown.
16-07-2020T20:39:00,LizardNettle,i dont think tom ever streams on time

16-07-2020T20:47:02,SageSaga,he admitted he meant it to be 2 brown bears- not 2 dire bears
16-07-2020T20:47:20,CrRAR,dire bears do sound pretty... dire
16-07-2020T20:47:35,SageSaga,didnt bring me back though- and so ended the tale of the half celestial monk

16-07-2020T20:48:56,CrRAR,sounds 100% effective so far
16-07-2020T20:49:09,CrRAR,super effective
16-07-2020T20:49:39,BadFoMo,I take it that even the DM isn't alowd to undo things if they make a mistake?
16-07-2020T20:50:10,Werewing,"They could, but the ability to do that smoothly varies."
16-07-2020T20:50:12,SageSaga,no they can
16-07-2020T20:50:41,Werewing,If you try to correct something from 3 sessions ago it wouldn't be smooth. And some are just sticklers for sticking to old decisions.
16-07-2020T20:50:42,CrRAR,only in soviet russia does mistake MAKE you!
16-07-2020T20:51:00,ZRO4825,"I mean, logically speaking he couldv'e gone ""....I have made a terrible mistake and as such, am going to rewind your reality to just before the start of the fight and you will now fight the correct bears..."""
16-07-2020T20:51:11,Werewing,There's also the rule of cool. Dying to Dire Bears can be an epic death for an early session.

16-07-2020T21:36:04,CrRAR,the BEEEG vote
16-07-2020T21:36:13,InTheLionsDen,Perhaps post a message to patreon specifying a cut-off. That should get them going.
16-07-2020T21:36:23,CrRAR,lots of orange bars?
16-07-2020T21:36:27,CrRAR,you know
16-07-2020T21:36:33,Werewing,Where is this beeg vote?

16-07-2020T21:37:20,CrRAR,yeah instead of rounds during stream all votes are cast before and top winners win
16-07-2020T21:37:29,CrRAR,Then Tom does picks from the list as well
16-07-2020T21:38:05,CrRAR,"kinda the same, but different"

16-07-2020T21:41:32,BadFoMo,I feel Omi is better if for no other reason you get to see how many /total/ votes you get rather than how many /1st place/ votes.
16-07-2020T21:41:44,CrRAR,yeah
16-07-2020T21:41:49,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah & sketch suggestions are also invisible for me still

16-07-2020T21:42:57,CrRAR,maybe something is glitched
16-07-2020T21:43:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"again, I’ve used the links, it’s been days so it’s had time to refresh, my history shows I’m paid"
16-07-2020T21:44:17,CrRAR,does patreon have support? idk
16-07-2020T21:44:32,Twokinds,Very odd
