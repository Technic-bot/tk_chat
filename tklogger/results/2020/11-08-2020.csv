11-08-2020T00:03:18,Dadrobit,Pretty much. It's just de la combined.
11-08-2020T00:15:55,AspiringNoodle,I must be really out of it
11-08-2020T00:16:06,AspiringNoodle,"Haven't eaten since like 2:30 P.M., not really hungry..."
11-08-2020T00:20:49,Dadrobit,I ordered wings with potato wedges in chili.
11-08-2020T00:21:00,Dadrobit,Good times in the guard shack.
11-08-2020T00:21:42,Dadrobit,And not because I woke up 5 minutes before I usually leave for work and had not time to eat or prep an actual meal.
11-08-2020T00:31:26,AspiringNoodle,That sounds amazing
11-08-2020T00:34:03,Dadrobit,Expensive as fuck though. More than an hour or overtime's worth in wages.
11-08-2020T00:34:08,Dadrobit,Of*
11-08-2020T00:34:45,Dadrobit,Potato wedges in chili were pretty excellent though. Saving the wings for later.
11-08-2020T00:39:22,AspiringNoodle,I'm debating whether or not I should go to Sheetz and get some food...
11-08-2020T00:39:37,AspiringNoodle,Came straight home after work.  And it can't be good for me to just not eat
11-08-2020T01:27:45,SpazztasticKiwi,ü¶â
11-08-2020T02:02:00,CrimsonHelsing,"*sees the last message* ""Welcome?"" lol!"
11-08-2020T02:12:45,Dadrobit,Goddamnit. Just checked my wings. Ordered boneless so I can eat them with a fork and stay clean at work. They sent me bone-in.
11-08-2020T02:13:01,Dadrobit,Actually can't work with this...
11-08-2020T02:14:13,Dadrobit,"They even have a ""the accuracy of this order was verified by _______ ."" Sticker. Shit did not get verified. Even the receipt said boneless."
11-08-2020T02:22:32,SpazztasticKiwi,anything that can be fixed in 10 minutes?
11-08-2020T02:22:54,Dadrobit,Nope. The place closed hours ago.
11-08-2020T02:24:12,Dadrobit,"Doordash says they gave credit to my account, but I dunno how much or how/where I can use it."
11-08-2020T02:24:31,Dadrobit,These wings were damn near $40 and I am legitimately chuffed about this...
11-08-2020T02:24:35,SpazztasticKiwi,might have to call them in the morning and see if they explain
11-08-2020T02:24:55,SpazztasticKiwi,there better be a gold bar in that kids meal with that price
11-08-2020T02:25:06,SpazztasticKiwi,or a mountain of wings
11-08-2020T02:25:45,Dadrobit,15 wings and an order of potato wedges in chili plus 2 ranch cups.
11-08-2020T02:26:04,Dadrobit,(really one ranch cups with how little is actually in each one)
11-08-2020T02:26:47,SpazztasticKiwi,nope
11-08-2020T02:26:51,SpazztasticKiwi,not worth it
11-08-2020T02:27:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt like chili fries so that‚Äôs half of it
11-08-2020T02:28:18,Dadrobit,Like $10 in delivery fees and $7 or $8 for the wedges and chili.
11-08-2020T02:28:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"if the delivery is more than the food, nah"
11-08-2020T02:28:54,Dadrobit,$19 for the wings by themselves.
11-08-2020T02:29:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt eat unless I can go get it or make it
11-08-2020T02:29:29,Dadrobit,Super not worth it from this place.
11-08-2020T02:29:53,SpazztasticKiwi,had them before?
11-08-2020T02:29:55,Dadrobit,I don't mind spending $20 on wings if they're good. This was not it chief
11-08-2020T02:30:05,Dadrobit,"Once, they were alright."
11-08-2020T02:30:27,Dadrobit,I usually hit up a place near my house if I want good wings.
11-08-2020T02:30:49,SpazztasticKiwi,is it a chain or town grown
11-08-2020T02:31:06,Dadrobit,But I woke up super late today and rushed to order some decent food before everything closed and I was left with McDonalds or bust.
11-08-2020T02:31:24,Dadrobit,My usual place or this one?
11-08-2020T02:31:33,SpazztasticKiwi,your usual
11-08-2020T02:31:37,Dadrobit,This one is a chain. Buffalo Wild wings.
11-08-2020T02:31:57,Dadrobit,"My usual was a chain, then the owner went and made it his own."
11-08-2020T02:32:01,SpazztasticKiwi,town grown usually knows exactly the kind of poison to cook for the people there
11-08-2020T02:33:05,SpazztasticKiwi,it is said that it only takes one bad experience for a customer to leave it
11-08-2020T02:34:28,Dadrobit,"The part that really kills my interest in ever doing business with them is that they took the time to stick on the ""your order's accuracy was verified by ______."" sticker."
11-08-2020T02:34:52,Dadrobit,"Like, it's just so aggressively bad"
11-08-2020T02:35:11,SpazztasticKiwi,was it Hellen Keller
11-08-2020T02:35:34,Dadrobit,No signature. They just used it as a sticker to attach the receipt to the box
11-08-2020T02:36:02,SpazztasticKiwi,better than it being wrong and someone signed it?
11-08-2020T02:37:27,Dadrobit,"No, because then you can point a specific finger at least to fix the problem. No signature at all tells me it's deeper and that it's likely the whole place doesn't give a shit."
11-08-2020T02:43:23,Dadrobit,I think I'm gonna go to my usual joint tomorrow before work just to cleanse my pallette.
11-08-2020T02:44:15,Dadrobit,They have ghost pepper wing sauce that is actually the most intense heat. Zero fucking around with that stuff. But it's sooo good.
