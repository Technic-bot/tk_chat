30-05-2020T15:13:34,Roughlandin,He said stream will probably be 4:30-5 today. I'd lean more towards 5
30-05-2020T15:13:43,ProsePro7,Okay.  Next question did he eat within the last 24 hrs
30-05-2020T15:14:01,ProsePro7,I know he forgets what food is from time to time
30-05-2020T15:14:08,Roughlandin,Hopefully that's what he's doing now
30-05-2020T15:14:14,ProsePro7,Hopefully
30-05-2020T15:16:43,mingun,Tom said he's need to get the winners assembled.
30-05-2020T15:17:26,PalmettoPathfinder1,Wonder what they'll be.  My fingers are crossed for the tango and ref sheet.
30-05-2020T15:17:38,ProsePro7,Take his time just bustin' him.  It's my fun

30-05-2020T15:22:47,Rainelover,Lol
30-05-2020T15:22:54,PalmettoPathfinder1,I'm planning on watching Fox and Hound today. It's one of my favorite Disney movies.
30-05-2020T15:23:01,PalmettoPathfinder1,I always cry during the movie.
30-05-2020T15:23:46,ProsePro7,Let me guess when Todd gets left out in the woods?
30-05-2020T15:24:01,Rainelover,"Oh lord, I couldn‚Äôt even FINISH that movie because of how fucking much it makes me cry"
30-05-2020T15:24:25,Roughlandin,I'm binging ATLA on Netflix
30-05-2020T15:24:38,ProsePro7,Up and Oliver and Company does the same to me.  Especially Up that opening almost killed me
30-05-2020T15:25:07,Zakuru,Inside Out made me cry
30-05-2020T15:25:45,ProsePro7,Now why would a character sacrificing their life to save a friend make anyone cry?
30-05-2020T15:26:12,Zakuru,who knows x3
30-05-2020T15:26:13,Rainelover,I really hope you‚Äôre joking
30-05-2020T15:26:19,Roughlandin,"Up, Inside Out, Coco, and the end of Toy Story 3"
30-05-2020T15:26:28,Zakuru,Toystory 3 got me good
30-05-2020T15:26:43,ProsePro7,"Coco is a tear jerker.  ""Remember me""...and yes I am"

30-05-2020T15:27:37,Roughlandin,I wish they'd included the Recuerda Me version in the English movie somewhere other than the credits. Best version of the song
30-05-2020T15:27:45,Rainelover,Hey keef!
30-05-2020T15:27:45,Roughlandin,Hi Keef. Green looks good on you
30-05-2020T15:27:48,Zakuru,i was honestly surprised Coco had such a dark twist.
30-05-2020T15:27:53,Sammit,Hi Keef
30-05-2020T15:28:00,ProsePro7,Dark twist?

30-05-2020T15:28:15,Roughlandin,"The whole poisoning thing, I'm guessing"
30-05-2020T15:28:44,ProsePro7,Considering their first movie had a poisoned apple thats not that dark for Disney...now Black Cauldron
30-05-2020T15:28:47,Roughlandin,Though Hunchback is still the darkest Disney movie by far
30-05-2020T15:28:52,KeefMcDerpface,"But wait, wasn't it Pixar that made the film?"
30-05-2020T15:29:06,Zakuru,Frollo is most evil disney villain
30-05-2020T15:29:14,ProsePro7,Black Cauldron vs Hunchback...hm hard pick for darkest

30-05-2020T15:29:52,Roughlandin,Coco was released by Disney but produced by Pixar. Like pretty much every modern Disney film lol

30-05-2020T15:31:01,KeefMcDerpface,Disney: Kid friendly. Everything owned by Disney: Not very kid friendly tbh.
30-05-2020T15:31:38,ProsePro7,"After the past few debacles they are trying to turn around, cant keep bleeding money like they have been"
30-05-2020T15:31:53,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúhow do we make a humdinger of a movie with a hell of a point as scarring as possible‚Äù
30-05-2020T15:31:58,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúhold my beer‚Äù
30-05-2020T15:32:13,Roughlandin,They still have more cash than like 75% of the world's national economies
30-05-2020T15:32:28,ProsePro7,"The old Disney classic, Kill a Parent"
30-05-2020T15:32:28,KeefMcDerpface,And yet they want more.
30-05-2020T15:32:57,Roughlandin,Think I read somewhere that if they started a country it'd be in the top 5 highest GDP in the world
30-05-2020T15:33:41,KeefMcDerpface,DisneyLand and DisneyWorld is secretly their countries.
30-05-2020T15:34:22,Roughlandin,Sigh. I miss going to Didney Worl

30-05-2020T15:50:28,Roughlandin,Mostly because Adelaide's pullow is a sack of bricks

30-05-2020T16:32:05,K3IDRAN,@Twokinds question does making comics sometimes stress you out or do you find a way to fight the stress?
30-05-2020T16:32:13,StrikerWolfcat,"What if Twokinds is Kat writing about her adventures and everything  she knows, or found out later."
30-05-2020T16:32:15,FreelancerAgentMaine,"gimme a second i need to find a song, I almost criend because of the memories it brought back"

30-05-2020T19:12:28,Twokinds,I don't tend to like pretzels because they're too plain. But I make an exception for jalape√±o pretzels
30-05-2020T19:12:31,StrikerWolfcat,then wipe it off

30-05-2020T20:38:05,KeefMcDerpface,Over her ears.
30-05-2020T20:38:06,Roughlandin,Kat wore them pretty well in the first pic
30-05-2020T20:38:09,KeefMcDerpface,^
30-05-2020T20:38:15,vevans0009,Not hard to see
30-05-2020T20:38:19,sodaYEET,true
30-05-2020T20:38:43,Stormagedon,Got to have a little bit longer band I bet
30-05-2020T20:38:51,Stormagedon,Ok I really am going now bye!
30-05-2020T20:38:54,AspiringNoodle,I imagine keidran earphones would be a mix between ear buds and traditional headphones
30-05-2020T20:38:55,KeefMcDerpface,o/
30-05-2020T20:38:55,Ordithus,probably easier for the keidran with perky ears.  Floppy ears like Evals?  Might be harder
30-05-2020T20:39:09,Roughlandin,Tom if you're wearing out we can call it a night. This month's winners have been... involved to say the least.
30-05-2020T20:39:13,KeefMcDerpface,"Hmm, Ord does have a point."
30-05-2020T20:39:24,AspiringNoodle,"They look like regular headphones, but then the inside is shaped more like pods that protrude into the ear"
30-05-2020T20:39:29,Roughlandin,That's why you get Kat brand Ear pins
30-05-2020T20:39:38,Roughlandin,Pin back them floppsy ears!
30-05-2020T20:39:44,Ordithus,ow
30-05-2020T20:39:56,Roughlandin,Not like a safety pin
30-05-2020T20:39:59,Roughlandin,Like a hair pin
30-05-2020T20:40:13,Ordithus,still seems uncomfortable
30-05-2020T20:40:14,sodaYEET,"now, that make more sense"
30-05-2020T20:40:27,Roughlandin,...Life for floppy eared folk is hard.
30-05-2020T20:40:29,AspiringNoodle,I honestly can't imagine keidrans would be able to use either traditional ear buds or headphones
30-05-2020T20:40:46,AspiringNoodle,"Headphones wouldn't stick, and buds would have to be so large as to be silly"
30-05-2020T20:40:46,KeefMcDerpface,I can see that hurting in the long run much like how normal headphones hurt after so many hours of use.
30-05-2020T20:40:49,Roughlandin,They'd be able to form mold something to make earbuds fit
30-05-2020T20:41:07,AspiringNoodle,So a hybrid option makes the most sense to me :P
30-05-2020T20:41:25,Roughlandin,Yeah. Those around-the-ear kind would probably work best
30-05-2020T20:41:26,KeefMcDerpface,Everything is orange.
30-05-2020T20:41:31,vevans0009,haha

30-05-2020T20:41:46,sodaYEET,I can imagine earbuds having plastic piece to make it fit

30-05-2020T20:42:09,Roughlandin,Take that Sony Atmos

30-05-2020T20:42:25,Roughlandin,Whatever
30-05-2020T20:42:36,Roughlandin,I got in trouble for brand dropping on Friday
30-05-2020T20:42:37,KeefMcDerpface,A tabby disguised as a tiger.
30-05-2020T20:42:56,KeefMcDerpface,Or vise versa.
30-05-2020T20:42:57,Roughlandin,So I'm messing them up on purpose. That's my story and I'm sticking to it!

30-05-2020T20:54:26,WINDOWS98SE,I wonder what tech YouTubers Laura watches. :thinking:
30-05-2020T20:54:32,WINDOWS98SE,LinusTechTips?
30-05-2020T20:54:36,Roughlandin,BitWit
30-05-2020T20:54:42,Roughlandin,Or JayZ
30-05-2020T20:54:48,AspiringNoodle,"Fun fact, RGB fans are a headache and a half if you want aRGB <3"
30-05-2020T20:55:12,Dimensional,aRGB?
30-05-2020T20:55:13,AspiringNoodle,"Rainbow Vomit = default settings, no controller, no software"
30-05-2020T20:55:18,Dimensional,Ah.
30-05-2020T20:55:21,AspiringNoodle,addressable RGB
30-05-2020T20:55:31,Roughlandin,Nzxt software sucks
30-05-2020T20:55:34,johnnytho,tactical gamer colors
30-05-2020T20:55:36,AspiringNoodle,"A fan can have a static color, or the ability to customize it"
30-05-2020T20:55:40,Gridwin,well only fans would buy RGB... wait...
30-05-2020T20:55:42,sodaYEET,"that's why I go with the peanut butter fan, Noctua"
30-05-2020T20:55:52,WINDOWS98SE,Wonder if she watches Louis Rossmann. :apple: :joy:
30-05-2020T20:55:59,Roughlandin,Ahh. Ugly fan. Great performance
30-05-2020T20:56:08,AspiringNoodle,"I have RGB in my case, part of it is that RGB gets tacked onto high end stuff and you have limited options without it"
30-05-2020T20:56:25,AspiringNoodle,"I'm too lazy and haven't downloaded control software, lol"
30-05-2020T20:56:31,sodaYEET,really?
30-05-2020T20:56:36,Gridwin,"well, i have bad experiences with warecoolers"
30-05-2020T20:56:44,Gridwin,eater coolers
30-05-2020T20:56:50,AspiringNoodle,AHAHAHA
30-05-2020T20:56:50,Gridwin,water.. damn finguers!
30-05-2020T20:56:51,sodaYEET,you mean water cool?
30-05-2020T20:57:07,AspiringNoodle,"I've used 2 corsair coolers, never had problems outside of my own stupidity, lol"
30-05-2020T20:57:30,KeefMcDerpface,I know someone who had a water cooled PC.
30-05-2020T20:57:32,sodaYEET,I tend to avoid it as its easier to maintain air cooler than water cool
30-05-2020T20:57:33,Roughlandin,My corsair AIO has never had an issue
30-05-2020T20:57:42,AspiringNoodle,"My first build only had 1 case fan, and the 120 AIO I used acted as the exhaust"
30-05-2020T20:57:49,sodaYEET,Corsair is reliable enough
30-05-2020T20:57:59,AspiringNoodle,"Except when I first built my computer, it was pulling air into the case, so I had 2 intake, no exhaust :ptv-laugh:"
30-05-2020T20:58:01,Gridwin,"well, i now have one big air cooler"
30-05-2020T20:58:11,AspiringNoodle,"When I finally got wise and flipped it around, immediately dropped CPU temps 20C"
30-05-2020T20:58:14,johnnytho,None of yall can even hold a candle up to my setup a candle up
30-05-2020T20:58:18,sodaYEET,we all been there mate
30-05-2020T20:58:20,johnnytho,a chromebook
30-05-2020T20:58:34,Roughlandin,"I might be kinda overkill on fans. I've got 2 intake, a 240mm rad and another 120mm as exhaust"
30-05-2020T20:58:35,johnnytho,wow fd that one up
30-05-2020T20:58:43,johnnytho,grammar
30-05-2020T20:58:44,AspiringNoodle,Current build:

30-05-2020T20:59:13,AspiringNoodle,"Dual 200mm intake fans, 140mm exhaust (top rear), 360mm AIO exhaust (top)"
30-05-2020T20:59:21,Roughlandin,Dang
30-05-2020T20:59:28,johnnytho,yea never get a chromebook
30-05-2020T20:59:28,Roughlandin,And I thought I had overkill
30-05-2020T20:59:43,AspiringNoodle,"I was slightly worried that I might be causing negative pressure in my case, but it seems to be doing just fine~"
30-05-2020T20:59:44,KeefMcDerpface,I had chromebooks in school.
30-05-2020T20:59:48,KeefMcDerpface,That was enough.
30-05-2020T21:00:07,Roughlandin,Speaking of overkill. Never let it be said Tom didn't go EXTRA on the lighting effects
30-05-2020T21:00:13,KeefMcDerpface,yep

30-05-2020T21:00:50,AspiringNoodle,We're getting to the point where even low-end ($600 - $800) laptops can play modern games well
30-05-2020T21:00:52,sodaYEET,the case look kinda like NZXT H510
30-05-2020T21:01:04,sodaYEET,but windows is flipped
30-05-2020T21:01:07,Roughlandin,...We didn't get issued PCs when I was in high school. We had to use trees.
30-05-2020T21:01:08,KeefMcDerpface,That's me Noodle.
30-05-2020T21:01:32,johnnytho,my computer cost me 10 pushups. True story.
30-05-2020T21:01:41,Jeebuus,We all had iPads in HS lol. I hated em personally.

30-05-2020T21:03:14,Jeebuus,Typing on a touchscreen isn't fun if it's anything longer than a Reddit comment or something along those lines.

30-05-2020T21:03:46,AspiringNoodle,"When I was in highschool, some of our classes (typically English for writing papers) got macs"
30-05-2020T21:03:49,Stormagedon,I had a random thought
30-05-2020T21:04:01,Stormagedon,How much shampoo does a Keidran use?
30-05-2020T21:04:01,AspiringNoodle,It was in those classes that I got introduced to firefox

30-05-2020T21:05:02,AspiringNoodle,Maybe we should petition for Laura to be made the mascot :)
30-05-2020T21:05:06,WINDOWS98SE,Laurafox.

30-05-2020T21:11:12,Stormagedon,"I am, Its a captured one too, so murica"
30-05-2020T21:11:14,Roughlandin,Considering it goes up against a lot of early cold war era tanks
30-05-2020T21:11:20,Stormagedon,"Yah, my bro was telling me that"
30-05-2020T21:11:36,Roughlandin,If it was limited to facing WWII era tanks it'd be fine.
30-05-2020T21:11:37,KeefMcDerpface,:crown:
30-05-2020T21:11:38,KeefMcDerpface,:tiger:
30-05-2020T21:11:51,Stormagedon,The Is tanks suck to go up against
30-05-2020T21:12:00,Roughlandin,Soviet tank stronk
30-05-2020T21:12:05,AspiringNoodle,It's funny
30-05-2020T21:12:16,Roughlandin,Made of pure Stalinium armor.
30-05-2020T21:12:28,AspiringNoodle,"Germany's starting takes were utter garbagio, they were Sherman tier in all honesty"
30-05-2020T21:12:37,Stormagedon,"See, I have the t-150, it not stronk"
30-05-2020T21:12:43,mingun,Is this the Keith statuette?
30-05-2020T21:12:56,AspiringNoodle,They had to face off against Russia's T-34 and KV variants
30-05-2020T21:12:56,Roughlandin,Hmm?
30-05-2020T21:13:05,Gridwin,"ok, I have to go"
30-05-2020T21:13:11,Roughlandin,Bye Grid
30-05-2020T21:13:12,KeefMcDerpface,bye Gridwin
30-05-2020T21:13:14,Gridwin,Portense mal guys!
30-05-2020T21:13:24,AspiringNoodle,It was when Germany FINALLY rolled out the famed Tiger and Panther versions that they finally turned the tide against Russia
30-05-2020T21:13:36,Roughlandin,Eh. When the tigers rolled.
30-05-2020T21:13:41,sodaYEET,get flooded by T34s tho
30-05-2020T21:13:44,Roughlandin,And didn't break down
30-05-2020T21:13:50,Stormagedon,"except they didn't, russia got to berlin first"
30-05-2020T21:14:18,AspiringNoodle,Are we talking WWI or II?
30-05-2020T21:14:18,sodaYEET,Rush Berlin
30-05-2020T21:14:23,Stormagedon,2
30-05-2020T21:14:48,sodaYEET,Hanz ze tranmission broke
30-05-2020T21:14:52,Stormagedon,I also got a rental period for the Lowe and Scorpion G
30-05-2020T21:15:03,AspiringNoodle,"'Cuz in WWII, Russia was getting beat back for a long time"
30-05-2020T21:15:08,Roughlandin,The rubber fuel hoses on the Tiger were notorious for having to be replaced like every hundred km or so because the diesel ate through them.
30-05-2020T21:15:24,NezumiYuki,"remains in lurk mode despite everyone talking about panzers...   Must resist spouting out ""Panzer vor!""....."
30-05-2020T21:15:25,Stormagedon,Oof
30-05-2020T21:15:29,AspiringNoodle,Mainly because their primary method for tank warfare was mass producing their current T-34 and KV tanks
30-05-2020T21:15:29,KeefMcDerpface,YUKI!!!
30-05-2020T21:15:30,KeefMcDerpface,Hi
30-05-2020T21:15:44,AspiringNoodle,"But when Germany brought out the new Panther and Tiger tanks, all of a sudden those things were fodder"
30-05-2020T21:15:49,NezumiYuki,uhhh Rough... Hate to call bull shi on that but... the Tigers and King Tigers were never Diesel....
30-05-2020T21:15:49,K3IDRAN,Rest In peace Noble 6 (me)
30-05-2020T21:15:57,sodaYEET,I mean if you cant make good tanks you just make a bunch of en
30-05-2020T21:15:59,kiabugboy,I thought the stream had a technical issue for a second
30-05-2020T21:16:05,Tylar,Just joining the stream after noticing something via the stream on discord: Is that a Vulcan model on that PC?
30-05-2020T21:16:06,AspiringNoodle,It would be years until they engineered the IS tanks and could finally reinstate the fear of Russian tanks into the germans
30-05-2020T21:16:07,Roughlandin,Were they petrol?
30-05-2020T21:16:15,Stormagedon,"Just remember noodle, they still lost"
30-05-2020T21:16:29,NezumiYuki,Yep every Henschel Tiger and Konigstiger were all petrol
30-05-2020T21:16:32,AspiringNoodle,"All Russian tanks ran on diesel, as it was super reliable in the wintry conditions of Siberia"
30-05-2020T21:16:48,Stormagedon,Cold boi
30-05-2020T21:16:55,Roughlandin,Hmm. Well that explains why they didn't have any fuel by the end of the war.
30-05-2020T21:16:57,NezumiYuki,Maybach power Yo!
30-05-2020T21:17:00,Stormagedon,"Ok, wish me luck"
30-05-2020T21:17:03,KeefMcDerpface,So German ran of petrol and Russians ran on diesel?
30-05-2020T21:17:10,AspiringNoodle,Yup
30-05-2020T21:17:13,sodaYEET,i swear historian can have conversation anywhere they go
30-05-2020T21:17:24,NezumiYuki,*back to lurk mode*
30-05-2020T21:17:24,Tylar,Yes.
30-05-2020T21:17:25,AspiringNoodle,It was one way that the German advance into Russia was hampered
30-05-2020T21:17:29,Glassan,Pretty much. History is interesting.
30-05-2020T21:17:31,Roughlandin,Makes sense
30-05-2020T21:17:51,AspiringNoodle,"Siberian winters are intense, and gas engines could have trouble starting in those conditions"
30-05-2020T21:17:56,Katfeathers,Because Russian Winter
30-05-2020T21:17:57,AspiringNoodle,But diesel laughs at cold weather
30-05-2020T21:17:58,Stormagedon,It is
30-05-2020T21:18:26,AspiringNoodle,"Fun fact, the russian KV tanks were referred to by the Germans, with fear, as ""Ghost"""
30-05-2020T21:18:34,KeefMcDerpface,":ptv-confused: You see, your first mistake was to invade during the winter,"
30-05-2020T21:18:40,AspiringNoodle,"Before they produced the Tigers and Panthers, the KV tanks were monsters"
30-05-2020T21:18:42,sodaYEET,you know they send you to Siberia to cut down tress cuz they dont want you to get cold
30-05-2020T21:19:02,AspiringNoodle,"They could attack from long distances, could bounce ANYTHING you threw at them, and destroyed anything they had"
30-05-2020T21:19:10,Roughlandin,And your second mistake was wagering with a Sicilian when DEATH was on the line! HAHAHAHAHA! *dies*
30-05-2020T21:19:13,NezumiYuki,back from lurk mode to add~   Diesels might cough and fart and protest... But they work good in cold...  Just difficult to start up...   Gasoline however... if it's too cold to start... Forget it!    Now back to Lurk Mode*
30-05-2020T21:19:16,KeefMcDerpface,":eyes: That PC tho,"
30-05-2020T21:19:24,Stormagedon,Lol Rough

30-05-2020T21:19:53,AspiringNoodle,"The KV-2 in particular was devastating, as it was mounted with a larger turret armed with a freakin' 120mm HOWITZER as the main armament"
30-05-2020T21:20:02,Roughlandin,Princess Bride is like my favorite movie
30-05-2020T21:20:15,Stormagedon,i have the book now
30-05-2020T21:20:18,sodaYEET,Kv 2 uses 152mm
30-05-2020T21:20:20,AspiringNoodle,I see Laura has an EVGA card :)
30-05-2020T21:20:28,Roughlandin,Wasn't it a naval gun?
30-05-2020T21:20:29,AspiringNoodle,"bleh, you're right yeet"
30-05-2020T21:20:35,Ordithus,is really Tom drawing his computer
30-05-2020T21:20:36,Glassan,any IDF weapon can be used for direct fire if you're brave enough...
30-05-2020T21:20:40,NezumiYuki,Back again*   LOL guys cut it out.. .I wanna lurk for a bit*     KV-2 is just big cannon on wheels...  Stalin love them!
30-05-2020T21:20:44,WINDOWS98SE,All the EVGAs I've had have died on me :(
30-05-2020T21:20:45,KeefMcDerpface,"lol,Ord"
30-05-2020T21:20:46,Ordithus,References!
30-05-2020T21:20:47,AspiringNoodle,"I'm confusing my guns, the KV-2 was a 152mm howitzer, the IS tanks were armed with 120mm cannons"
30-05-2020T21:20:54,Roughlandin,Tom wants to share his :fire: rig with the world!
30-05-2020T21:21:01,Ordithus,Is the current computer named Nora?
30-05-2020T21:21:05,Ordithus,Or was that one of the others
30-05-2020T21:21:08,sodaYEET,if its his PC then his motherboard must be mounted upside-down tho
30-05-2020T21:21:13,Roughlandin,Think that's what he said once
30-05-2020T21:21:16,johnnytho,Tom is flexing
30-05-2020T21:21:18,Glassan,Laura be watchin' her own stream.
30-05-2020T21:21:19,Roughlandin,Cause it be white
30-05-2020T21:21:20,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Streamception
30-05-2020T21:21:28,AspiringNoodle,"Come on guys, lol"
30-05-2020T21:21:32,KeefMcDerpface,lol
30-05-2020T21:21:38,Ordithus,Could be the Raine by that logic
30-05-2020T21:21:38,Roughlandin,Bish Laura IS the stream.
30-05-2020T21:21:40,AspiringNoodle,It's common for streamers to have a monitor set up solely for stream
30-05-2020T21:21:50,KeefMcDerpface,^
30-05-2020T21:21:53,AspiringNoodle,That way they can make sure it's actually running and interact with the viewers
30-05-2020T21:22:08,sodaYEET,2 monitors are almost always better than 1
30-05-2020T21:22:13,Roughlandin,Does she have an RGB mouse pad too?
30-05-2020T21:22:14,KeefMcDerpface,Hence the double momitors.
30-05-2020T21:22:29,KeefMcDerpface,*monitors
30-05-2020T21:22:35,PalmettoPathfinder1,I think this is a great suggestion: Trace cosplaying as Hades afrom the Disney Hercules.  :P
30-05-2020T21:22:38,Roughlandin,Adelaide is the momitor
30-05-2020T21:22:42,Glassan,Agreed. How else can you study/work and slack off watching streams simultaneously?
30-05-2020T21:22:48,PalmettoPathfinder1,Adelaide is the sexy monitor.
30-05-2020T21:22:53,NezumiYuki,"1 monitor for working on the project, 1 for reading the chats, and the 3rd for making sure the stream is up and not stalled or requiring a restart*   That's how most big streamers go."
30-05-2020T21:22:55,Roughlandin,*momitor
30-05-2020T21:23:15,KeefMcDerpface,yep...

30-05-2020T21:24:00,NezumiYuki,*bak to lurking*
30-05-2020T21:24:24,Ordithus,might be a UPS
30-05-2020T21:24:25,Roughlandin,Nezumi be watchin y'all. Keep them historical ref accurate
30-05-2020T21:24:32,Roughlandin,Aaah that makes sense Ord
30-05-2020T21:24:43,Roughlandin,Hence the numbers n junk
30-05-2020T21:24:56,KeefMcDerpface,":eyes: There's a ""90"" on there."
30-05-2020T21:25:05,sodaYEET,perhaps a ups?
30-05-2020T21:25:06,Roughlandin,Ooh. That's a lotta watts... I think.
30-05-2020T21:25:10,johnnytho,I wonder how Tom setup looks
30-05-2020T21:25:16,Roughlandin,Prolly like that
30-05-2020T21:25:31,NezumiYuki,*Surprise suprise*  This IS Tom!
30-05-2020T21:25:34,NezumiYuki,:O

30-05-2020T21:25:35,johnnytho,no drawing tablet
30-05-2020T21:25:41,KeefMcDerpface,^
30-05-2020T21:25:47,KeefMcDerpface,In storage?
30-05-2020T21:25:52,Roughlandin,Tom ordered from Norkea and got turned into a fox girl.
30-05-2020T21:26:04,NezumiYuki,"Tom just never told us, he is secretly a Squirrel"
30-05-2020T21:26:05,Stormagedon,*Le Gasp!*
30-05-2020T21:26:12,KeefMcDerpface,It all makes sense now.
30-05-2020T21:26:20,sodaYEET,Tom take of his mask to reveal that he was Laura all along
30-05-2020T21:26:29,NezumiYuki,Le GAsp! :O

30-05-2020T21:33:33,NezumiYuki,You cannot kill a Yota Hilux... You just can't
30-05-2020T21:33:38,KeefMcDerpface,^
30-05-2020T21:33:52,KeefMcDerpface,"Well rust can, but that takes forever."
30-05-2020T21:33:54,Roughlandin,I miss my cousin's old 80s Hilux
30-05-2020T21:33:58,sodaYEET,unless you dont know how manual gear work
30-05-2020T21:34:02,Roughlandin,That thing was a tank
30-05-2020T21:34:05,Stormagedon,"note to self, if track gets hit in king boi, you go much slower"
30-05-2020T21:34:14,Roughlandin,He rolled it like 3 separate times
30-05-2020T21:34:18,Glassan,Many 80s cars were mini-tanks.
30-05-2020T21:34:27,Jeebuus,I've actually got a 94 Pickup myself and I love it to death tbh.
30-05-2020T21:34:40,sodaYEET,Hilux is just a good technical
30-05-2020T21:34:45,Jeebuus,Thing's been through a lot and it's still going strong.
30-05-2020T21:34:51,Stormagedon,Its because they were steel I think
30-05-2020T21:35:34,Roughlandin,He basically had it technical-ed out. He ruined the bed in the first rollover so we made a flatbed out of some 2x4s
30-05-2020T21:35:54,Roughlandin,And we stripped the paint and repainted it matt desert tan
30-05-2020T21:35:59,Jeebuus,lol nice
30-05-2020T21:36:08,sodaYEET,I think russia made a Hilux-ripoff so they can make Tachanka out of it
30-05-2020T21:36:26,KeefMcDerpface,"Man, the trucks of today are just luxury cars if you think about."
30-05-2020T21:36:37,Roughlandin,"It was a beast. I don't know how we didn't die, considering that was back when you didn't have to wear seatbelts in trucks"
30-05-2020T21:36:51,sodaYEET,f150 back in 2010 were still a real work truck
30-05-2020T21:36:51,Roughlandin,And I was passenger in 2 of the 3 rollovers
30-05-2020T21:37:05,WINDOWS98SE,Fire Doritos for the Firefox!
30-05-2020T21:37:14,KeefMcDerpface,Rough did a barrel roll?
30-05-2020T21:37:17,NezumiYuki,How to trigger some car tuners.... Introduce them to an Aussie Hilux that's 4AGE powered... yeah that's right.. the same yota engine in yer AE86!

30-05-2020T21:39:01,Roughlandin,The 90s were a magical... horrible time
30-05-2020T21:39:21,NezumiYuki,How to further piss off some car tuners.... Introduce them to another engine swapped 4x4...   Another Hilux... but this time with a Celica engine in it... 3SGTE xDD
30-05-2020T21:39:21,Glassan,That could be said about most any decade.
30-05-2020T21:39:30,Jeebuus,"For now tho I'm considering 2J swapping it since there's a decent number of people who have done that, plenty of knowledge to go round."
30-05-2020T21:39:42,NezumiYuki,I was about to get to that Jeebuus
30-05-2020T21:39:49,Jeebuus,lol

30-05-2020T21:44:53,Roughlandin,Fox girl and 3500 calories of regret?

30-05-2020T21:45:48,Roughlandin,I'm not the best judge of calories
30-05-2020T21:45:49,Glassan,The rest is surely hid underneath the chair.
30-05-2020T21:45:53,KeefMcDerpface,^

30-05-2020T21:46:07,KeefMcDerpface,Nora Cat hid the evidence?
30-05-2020T21:46:29,Glassan,Nora Cat probably ate the rest while Laura was sleeping.
30-05-2020T21:46:33,KeefMcDerpface,lol
30-05-2020T21:46:48,Roughlandin,...Why does one of those stream deck buttons have a little whip logo on it?
30-05-2020T21:47:00,Raventail,"What makes the pretzels ""Keidran safe""?"
30-05-2020T21:47:06,KeefMcDerpface,We don't know.
30-05-2020T21:47:09,Roughlandin,Grain free?
30-05-2020T21:47:26,Ordithus,you know cans of tuna?
30-05-2020T21:47:26,AspiringNoodle,$5 says it's a marketing gimmick
30-05-2020T21:47:38,KeefMcDerpface,We been fighting over that for like 2 hours.
30-05-2020T21:47:42,Roughlandin,Like fat free canned peas

30-05-2020T21:48:06,Roughlandin,Exile Vilify is such a good song
30-05-2020T21:48:09,AspiringNoodle,"It's no safer than other pretzels, but because it's likely the *first* to do it, sales went up :P"
30-05-2020T21:48:11,sodaYEET,marketing team always do that
30-05-2020T21:48:19,Katfeathers,Sounds like an easy $5
30-05-2020T21:48:21,Roughlandin,I loved Portal 2
30-05-2020T21:48:43,Glassan,"If it's the same reason as the ""dolphin-safe"" on tuna, that leads to a lot of uncomfortable questions..."
30-05-2020T21:49:18,Roughlandin,THAT explains why Trace likes regular pretzels so much!
30-05-2020T21:49:25,WINDOWS98SE,"Seems like the best songs these days are from video games/TV/movies, etc."
30-05-2020T21:49:43,Roughlandin,It true

30-05-2020T21:52:03,Roughlandin,Tom hears things and likes them
30-05-2020T21:52:11,Roughlandin,Then adds them to his spotify playlist

30-05-2020T22:11:35,NezumiYuki,There are times when simply joining streams and having fun in the chatbox can teach someone more about a laungauge than just taking classes.   :)

30-05-2020T22:12:38,Roughlandin,I used to be able to speak Spanish. Now I know enough to make my Ecuadorian friend laugh at how poor my Spanish is...

30-05-2020T22:51:41,Roughlandin,hmm
30-05-2020T22:51:57,Ordithus,usually Tom is done with coloring Raine as soon as he draws her
30-05-2020T22:52:00,KeefMcDerpface,"Well, Tom does give a bit of a glow to things."
30-05-2020T22:52:14,Roughlandin,Tom sighs in relief whenever Raine wins a color vote lol
30-05-2020T22:52:22,KeefMcDerpface,And Nora?
30-05-2020T22:52:30,InTheLionsDen,Rain and Nora in a snowstorm
30-05-2020T22:52:32,Roughlandin,I was about to say lol
30-05-2020T22:52:34,Ordithus,"""Raine in a snowy field"""
30-05-2020T22:52:36,Ordithus,haha
30-05-2020T22:52:36,InTheLionsDen,*Raine
30-05-2020T22:52:50,Roughlandin,Raine and Nora eating vanilla ice cream in a blizzard
30-05-2020T22:53:01,KeefMcDerpface,All you see are the eyes.
30-05-2020T22:53:07,Roughlandin,Lol!
30-05-2020T22:53:11,KeefMcDerpface,:eye: :eye: :eyes:
30-05-2020T22:53:50,KeefMcDerpface,Tom did make a Nora in a blizzard sketch for the lols but I don't remember if he posted it.
30-05-2020T22:54:10,InTheLionsDen,:ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:
30-05-2020T22:54:11,Roughlandin,Hmm. Dragon Nora hunting in the snow is actually a pretty neat idea... Be cool to see her actually blend in for once
30-05-2020T22:54:30,Roughlandin,Do dragons need to eat in TK? Has that ever been established?
30-05-2020T22:54:39,KeefMcDerpface,BRB Rough.
30-05-2020T22:54:44,Roughlandin,KK!
30-05-2020T22:54:49,Ordithus,Heh reminds me of this https://www.patreon.com/posts/just-drawing-of-19731041
30-05-2020T22:55:06,Roughlandin,Lol!
30-05-2020T22:55:12,KeefMcDerpface,"Oh yeah, there's that."
30-05-2020T22:55:14,Roughlandin,How have I never seen that before now!
30-05-2020T22:55:20,Roughlandin,That's adorable!
30-05-2020T22:55:27,KeefMcDerpface,And Maddie and Maeve in the snow too.
30-05-2020T22:55:33,Ordithus,And this piece of Madelyn https://www.deviantart.com/twokinds/art/Home-Turf-Advantage-788643024
30-05-2020T22:55:46,KeefMcDerpface,There it is.
30-05-2020T22:55:47,Roughlandin,Awww. That one I remember
30-05-2020T22:56:10,Roughlandin,What a cute pic of Maddie... Juuuuuust Maddie
30-05-2020T22:56:15,Roughlandin,Nobody else
30-05-2020T22:56:48,KeefMcDerpface,Here you go Rough http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/248/
30-05-2020T22:56:55,KeefMcDerpface,According to Nora...
30-05-2020T22:57:11,Roughlandin,Hmm.
30-05-2020T22:57:30,Roughlandin,Guess that answers that
30-05-2020T22:58:06,Roughlandin,"Didn't know if TK followed the ""dragons subsist off pure magical energy"" trope"
30-05-2020T22:58:17,Roughlandin,Guess even dragons are human
30-05-2020T22:58:22,Roughlandin,...or something
30-05-2020T22:58:47,KeefMcDerpface,"Well, she was very weak when the tower exploded."
30-05-2020T22:58:52,Roughlandin,True
30-05-2020T22:59:35,Roughlandin,"Wonder how long her ""long sleep"" is going to be... It seemed kinda... forever-y"
30-05-2020T22:59:47,KeefMcDerpface,"So it's like every survival game. You got sleep, food, health, and in the case of dragons, mana."
30-05-2020T23:01:22,Roughlandin,Guess we'll find out at the end of the chapter when she swoops in for a Deus ex Nora.

30-05-2020T23:02:17,Roughlandin,Tom confirmed. Dergs do da nomz
30-05-2020T23:02:35,Twokinds,"Dragons in Twokinds are being of magic, but they do eat"
30-05-2020T23:02:55,Ordithus,food is too good to ignore
30-05-2020T23:02:59,KeefMcDerpface,yep
30-05-2020T23:03:15,Roughlandin,Yeah. Food is more fun than mana osmosis
30-05-2020T23:03:33,Roughlandin,Or... Manasynthesis?
30-05-2020T23:04:18,KeefMcDerpface,Now the question is how much food does a dragon need to eat?.
30-05-2020T23:04:44,Roughlandin,No wonder they like treasure so much. Imagine how much it must cost to get a day's worth of food!
30-05-2020T23:05:00,Twokinds,A lot!
30-05-2020T23:05:23,Roughlandin,"Reni: ""Yes, I would like one of everything, please."""
30-05-2020T23:05:34,Roughlandin,"Reni: ""Actually, make that ALL of everything."""
