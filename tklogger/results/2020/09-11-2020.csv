09-11-2020T01:43:58,SpazztasticKiwi,laura would like it
09-11-2020T02:26:05,Dadrobit,"Boy, I had to Google that one."

09-11-2020T03:05:41,AspiringNoodle,Lady in a cosmetics store gets overcharged 10 cents by accident by the cashier.  Cashier immediately refunds the 10 cents and offer some free samples as apology.
09-11-2020T03:06:24,AspiringNoodle,"Lady goes nuts because the purchase was by card and the 10 cents wouldn't be in her account immediately.  She turned down 10 cents in change, as well."
09-11-2020T03:06:54,AspiringNoodle,"Lady then knocks over a cosmetics display, breaking most of the products and damaging the display itself."
09-11-2020T03:07:04,AspiringNoodle,"She ends up being ordered by the court to pay $10,000 in damages."
09-11-2020T03:07:12,AspiringNoodle,All over 10 cents.  smdh
09-11-2020T03:23:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs just what she called the design
09-11-2020T03:23:26,SpazztasticKiwi,not necessarily an actual thing you can buy

09-11-2020T13:49:20,SpazztasticKiwi,so I got a drink at the gas station before going into town n the attendant told me not to worry about it
09-11-2020T14:06:01,AspiringNoodle,awww~
09-11-2020T14:13:38,Dadrobit,:/ I've not interacted in a meaningful way with a cashier for most of a year now.
09-11-2020T14:13:44,Dadrobit,All self serve everywhere.
09-11-2020T14:13:49,Dadrobit,Feels kinda bad
09-11-2020T14:18:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I asked him if he was sure and he said yeah so
09-11-2020T14:18:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I guess I legally stole a pepsi
09-11-2020T14:26:06,AspiringNoodle,"The last time I got a free drink, it was because a new employee was learning the ropes"
09-11-2020T14:26:25,AspiringNoodle,And he messed up the transaction in a way that a supervisor stepped in to help figure out how to finish things up
09-11-2020T14:30:14,CrRAR,:ptv-dealwithit: nice
09-11-2020T14:36:21,Dadrobit,Used to give out free stuff a fair bit when I worked as a cashier. Depended entirely on the customer and how much they got along with me lol.
09-11-2020T14:36:57,Dadrobit,"If something refused to ring up, and it wasn't worth my time, fuck it, put it in the bag and move on."
09-11-2020T14:38:11,Dadrobit,"Never anything TOO expensive, but a couple folks got some free or $0.01 steaks."

09-11-2020T21:09:58,SpazztasticKiwi,technically that‚Äôs still the bigger target

09-11-2020T22:05:39,Kiwipower,She‚Äôs adorable but I have no idea who she is
09-11-2020T22:05:56,AspiringNoodle,You'll find out eventually
09-11-2020T22:06:04,AspiringNoodle,As well as why she's so excited in this sketch <3
09-11-2020T22:06:07,Kiwipower,I‚Äôm on chapter 4

09-11-2020T22:06:41,Kiwipower,He‚Äôs art is amazing!
09-11-2020T22:07:08,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Yeah
09-11-2020T22:07:13,AspiringNoodle,"For me, he's a source of inspiration"
09-11-2020T22:07:26,AspiringNoodle,Just gotta draw for 15 years and hopefully I'll be half as good as him :snail:
09-11-2020T22:07:34,Kiwipower,"I don‚Äôt draw but yeah, I can see that"
09-11-2020T22:07:48,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,lol
09-11-2020T22:09:22,AspiringNoodle,"Not today though, haha"
09-11-2020T22:09:32,AspiringNoodle,The pre-patch event for WoW launched today
09-11-2020T22:10:04,AspiringNoodle,That said... my main toon is done with it.  Soooooooooo shouldn't suck up all my time
09-11-2020T22:10:44,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,"He also has a Patreon, Twitter, Instagram (abandoned currently) and a few other things I can‚Äôt name off the top of my head"
09-11-2020T22:11:07,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Idk why he abandoned insta ü§î
09-11-2020T22:11:14,Kiwipower,"Oh, wow"
09-11-2020T22:12:45,Kiwipower,I only knew about Picarto and DA
09-11-2020T22:12:52,Kiwipower,I found him through DA
09-11-2020T22:16:02,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,"Yeah, andyou only have to pay a dollar to see his content on patreon"
09-11-2020T22:16:32,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,It‚Äôs a good deal for great art almost every day of the month
09-11-2020T22:16:48,Kiwipower,Yeah
09-11-2020T22:17:05,Kiwipower,Why doesn‚Äôt he stream on YT?
09-11-2020T22:17:24,Kiwipower,Cuz Picarto is laggy/glitchy as hell
09-11-2020T22:17:49,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Probably to make money off subscriptions
09-11-2020T22:18:12,Kiwipower,Doesn‚Äôt YT have subscriptions now??
09-11-2020T22:18:25,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,...don‚Äôt know
09-11-2020T22:18:50,Kiwipower,I think they do ü§î
09-11-2020T22:19:11,Kiwipower,üôÇ
09-11-2020T22:22:59,AspiringNoodle,They do.
09-11-2020T22:23:15,AspiringNoodle,But there's no telling how they'd feel about some of his more risque sketches
09-11-2020T22:26:15,Kiwipower,Trueee
09-11-2020T22:27:54,AspiringNoodle,Picarto is more or less designed / run / marketed as a safe haven for art streams
09-11-2020T22:29:04,Kiwipower,I just don‚Äôt like Picarto bc (idk on Toms stream but) a lot of moderator delete things that aren‚Äôt that baf
09-11-2020T22:29:09,Kiwipower,Bad*
09-11-2020T22:29:36,Kiwipower,And I don‚Äôt get it
09-11-2020T22:29:56,Kiwipower,"Bc, why delete like bad words etc if the stream has them in it"
09-11-2020T22:29:59,AspiringNoodle,"For Tom's streams, keep these things in mind: Keep it PG-13, and try to avoid politics."
09-11-2020T22:30:23,AspiringNoodle,"We sometimes slip into politics while there is no stream, but on stream is silly / lighthearted"
09-11-2020T22:30:44,Kiwipower,When DOES he stream?
09-11-2020T22:30:56,AspiringNoodle,There's a cute little Maddie snooping at the top of the chat
09-11-2020T22:30:59,AspiringNoodle,She can tell you :D
09-11-2020T22:31:12,Kiwipower,Huh?

09-11-2020T22:31:54,AspiringNoodle,4pm sunday (sketch streams)
09-11-2020T22:32:08,Kiwipower,He does that many??
09-11-2020T22:32:12,Kiwipower,Sketches
09-11-2020T22:32:20,Kiwipower,Why doesn‚Äôt he post the sketches?
09-11-2020T22:32:58,AspiringNoodle,He posts them to Patreon
09-11-2020T22:33:09,Kiwipower,Oop
09-11-2020T22:33:13,AspiringNoodle,"And if they're too risque and Patreon will age-gate them, then he also posts to DA"
09-11-2020T22:33:14,Kiwipower,Ok then
09-11-2020T22:33:50,Kiwipower,Wait-
09-11-2020T22:34:03,Kiwipower,Does that mean it‚Äôs free to see he‚Äôs stuff on pattern?!
09-11-2020T22:34:15,Kiwipower,Patreon*
09-11-2020T22:34:15,AspiringNoodle,Yup
09-11-2020T22:34:20,AspiringNoodle,Tom doesn't paywall anything
09-11-2020T22:34:54,AspiringNoodle,I think you've got about 4 years of stuff to look at.
09-11-2020T22:34:59,AspiringNoodle,And over 1000 sketches :snail:
09-11-2020T22:35:03,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Except voting :(
09-11-2020T22:35:15,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,I would like to sketch vote sometimes
09-11-2020T22:36:34,Kiwipower,I have a feeling I‚Äôm bugging you guys with the Qs but-
09-11-2020T22:36:39,Kiwipower,Voting?
09-11-2020T22:36:51,AspiringNoodle,I have a *bunch* of creators I want to support.  And hopefully will once I make more moneys
09-11-2020T22:37:11,AspiringNoodle,"So Sundays are sketch streams, but patrons vote on sketch suggestions and the winners get sketched by Tom"
09-11-2020T22:37:26,AspiringNoodle,"Patrons get 4 picks,a nd then Tom picks any 3 that he likes."
09-11-2020T22:38:05,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,It was free to sketch vote for a little while but not anymore
09-11-2020T22:38:14,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Aleast

09-11-2020T22:39:12,Kiwipower,But that‚Äôs pretty cool!
09-11-2020T22:39:38,Kiwipower,I didn‚Äôt know the art was user selected
09-11-2020T22:40:43,Kiwipower,Does The owner have a discord??
09-11-2020T22:41:06,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,I don‚Äôt think so but there are some servers made by fans
09-11-2020T22:41:25,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,I don‚Äôt like discord servers but if that‚Äôs your kind of thing go for it
09-11-2020T22:42:49,Kiwipower,Depends on the community in the server
09-11-2020T22:43:00,Kiwipower,Are they nice??
09-11-2020T22:43:22,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,The more popular server has some trollers
09-11-2020T22:43:40,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Ans a person named ‚Äúfuck‚Äù
09-11-2020T22:43:56,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,But I like the second one better
09-11-2020T22:44:38,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,"No troller, nicer community"
09-11-2020T22:44:49,Kiwipower,Oh
09-11-2020T22:44:54,Kiwipower,Ok
09-11-2020T22:45:11,Kiwipower,Are you guys in the server??
