19-11-2020T22:48:58,BadFoMo,Maybe we should move streaming over to YouTube until Picarto gets in together?
19-11-2020T22:49:06,NezumiYuki,Picarto can't change over to the new server little by little so everyone is stuck with the old servers for now... and the old server is showing its age... like horribly so!
19-11-2020T22:49:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Toms probably not got anything ready to stream with yt

19-11-2020T23:02:14,SpazztasticKiwi,it was a deep fried hot dog stuffed pickle
19-11-2020T23:02:34,SageSaga,"its like fast baking so people call it ""air frying"" but it's not really- but its not bad"

19-11-2020T23:28:33,Ordithus,I can watch Sage on a European server! \o/
19-11-2020T23:28:37,SageSaga,since i moved the stream to the west coast server it seems to be working for me
19-11-2020T23:28:47,NezumiYuki,dats odd!
19-11-2020T23:29:03,Twokinds,Sage you seem down to me
19-11-2020T23:29:05,CrimsonHelsing,I think internet in general is being terrible today. Connectivity went to near zero hours earlier for me
19-11-2020T23:29:17,FreelancerAgentMaine,My pc recently has decided to stop letting me stream at a good frame rate
19-11-2020T23:29:24,Rainelover,"Maybe that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs not showing for me, I‚Äôm on the east coast"
19-11-2020T23:29:26,InTheLionsDen,Both show as offline to me
19-11-2020T23:29:27,NezumiYuki,"Okay here's what I see... Sage is up and running but you, Tom, you're down for me atm"
19-11-2020T23:29:29,BadFoMo,Sage is offline for me too.

19-11-2020T23:29:45,KeefMcDerpface,How odd.
19-11-2020T23:29:45,BadFoMo,...Tom too.
19-11-2020T23:29:56,NezumiYuki,wow
19-11-2020T23:29:58,NezumiYuki,just wow
19-11-2020T23:30:07,NezumiYuki,Picarto is really Borked right now!   xDD
19-11-2020T23:30:18,Ordithus,I think it is specific servers
19-11-2020T23:30:21,Dadrobit,"Both are down for me. On mobile though, so that's pretty standard. Just looking at Keith staring at an empty screen."
19-11-2020T23:30:22,Folfy,sage is live for me strange

19-11-2020T23:31:22,BadFoMo,Yes.
19-11-2020T23:31:29,Twokinds,Something is wrong on Picarto's end.

19-11-2020T23:31:47,Rainelover,Picarto killed itself
19-11-2020T23:31:47,Dadrobit,"Yeah, his offline picture is the one where Keith is looking in from the right edge at a few articles of clothing. The one with Natani missing."
19-11-2020T23:31:50,SageSaga,yeah its picarto- im still connected and streaming but it shows me as offline when i refresh

19-11-2020T23:56:12,Dadrobit,That's... Verging on illegal? Unless the contract Tom has w/ Keenspot specifies Tom's given up distribution rights?
19-11-2020T23:56:24,Pwatcher67,hi again

19-11-2020T23:57:22,Inscrutable,That's cool for Tom if he's getting the cut he should. Comixology is a pretty neat place to read comics for money
19-11-2020T23:58:28,Dadrobit,"Still, Tom should have been made aware of and signed off on alternative publishing locations."
