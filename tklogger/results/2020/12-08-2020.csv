12-08-2020T02:03:51,Dadrobit,RIP Tom
12-08-2020T02:04:54,SpazztasticKiwi,your memory will live on
12-08-2020T02:05:29,Dadrobit,Are you going off of Patreon or your personal files?
12-08-2020T02:05:32,Twokinds,"Man, Nov 2016. So long ago, and yet, it doesn't feel so long."
12-08-2020T02:05:40,SpazztasticKiwi,oh they say that for my sister but pictures with my immediate first cousins is like CTRL C/CTRL V
12-08-2020T02:05:54,Dadrobit,Asking because Patreon is ass for scrolling through content.
12-08-2020T02:05:59,SpazztasticKiwi,only 4 little years
12-08-2020T02:06:25,Twokinds,"Yeah, it is. I have to go month by month or it slows to a crawl."

12-08-2020T02:08:11,SpazztasticKiwi,in spirit
12-08-2020T02:08:20,Dadrobit,I wonder how those super old ones are counted. Way back then it was just you taking suggestions from everyone in chat whenever you were streaming for giggles.
12-08-2020T02:08:45,Dadrobit,"Are they considered ""Sunday Sketches"" as well?"
12-08-2020T02:11:15,Twokinds,Only the official sunday sketches that started on Nov 6 and onward count
12-08-2020T02:11:20,Twokinds,The ones that were suggestions
12-08-2020T02:12:37,AspiringNoodle,I pray for your mental health.  'Tis no easy task you are completing
12-08-2020T02:13:05,Dadrobit,"Spazz, 2016 was a good year I think."
12-08-2020T02:13:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I was just out of hs
12-08-2020T02:13:53,Dadrobit,Personally at least. It was the first year I started taking a career as a VA seriously and got back into college for my audio engineering degree.
12-08-2020T02:14:10,Twokinds,there's your sketch
12-08-2020T02:14:17,Twokinds,I always remember it was one of the first.
12-08-2020T02:14:20,Dadrobit,\o/
12-08-2020T02:14:24,Twokinds,And first to color
12-08-2020T02:14:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve only been here 3 years you know
12-08-2020T02:14:53,Dadrobit,I had a hot streak early on iirc.
12-08-2020T02:14:56,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe
12-08-2020T02:15:35,Dadrobit,"And then I tried getting a Keith and Maddie sketch that began my branding of ""keep requesting until Tom takes pity on me""."
12-08-2020T02:16:03,Dadrobit,"Welcome, Spazz!"
12-08-2020T02:17:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"patreon, at least 3 years"
12-08-2020T02:17:31,Dadrobit,I started lurking in the community back in '08 or so. Didn't really become an active member until around about '11.
12-08-2020T02:17:38,SpazztasticKiwi,& I started paying soon after jumping on here
12-08-2020T02:18:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I watched for awhile before trying out an account
12-08-2020T02:18:20,AspiringNoodle,I started reading the comic somewhere on the back end of the basitin isle arc
12-08-2020T02:18:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I was originally going to play neutral so people wouldn‚Äôt know I was a girl
12-08-2020T02:18:26,Dadrobit,"Seen a lotta drama, and a lot of folks come and go."
12-08-2020T02:18:39,Dadrobit,But here I remain lol.
12-08-2020T02:18:41,AspiringNoodle,been off and on
12-08-2020T02:18:50,AspiringNoodle,I'm hoping to stick around
12-08-2020T02:18:53,SpazztasticKiwi,but then I found out some will be confused whether it‚Äôs known or not
12-08-2020T02:19:12,SpazztasticKiwi,& I still get those shocked people like women don‚Äôt exist on the internet
12-08-2020T02:19:26,AspiringNoodle,"""Wait, no gender?  Clearly a guy / girl.  One of the two.  Can't possibly be niether"" :P"
12-08-2020T02:19:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I can easily pass as neither
12-08-2020T02:19:59,SpazztasticKiwi,cross dressing is generally easy
12-08-2020T02:20:09,SpazztasticKiwi,but I don‚Äôt do it often
12-08-2020T02:20:16,Dadrobit,Same
12-08-2020T02:20:25,SpazztasticKiwi,*sad rimshot*
12-08-2020T02:20:59,Dadrobit,"Somewhere out there, there are pictures of me in drag. Have fun."
12-08-2020T02:21:23,SpazztasticKiwi,don‚Äôt know what you look like normally
12-08-2020T02:21:29,SpazztasticKiwi,so my innocence is safe
12-08-2020T02:21:34,SpazztasticKiwi,from all sides
12-08-2020T02:21:43,SpazztasticKiwi,that‚Äôs why I originally thought Nat had her boobs wrapped - cause that shit gets in the way
12-08-2020T02:22:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"with how blessed.....we‚Äôll slinging knives around and hand to hand, it‚Äôs good to keep them contained if not hidden all together"
12-08-2020T02:22:39,SpazztasticKiwi,well
12-08-2020T02:23:14,Dadrobit,Flynn Rider and young Matthew Mcconaughey are the two I've heard.
12-08-2020T02:23:32,Dadrobit,Also my avatar here.
12-08-2020T02:23:45,Dadrobit,Kinda sorta but less green.
12-08-2020T02:24:28,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah you mentioned that was a cartoon somebody did of you once
12-08-2020T02:24:53,SpazztasticKiwi,app doesn‚Äôt show pictures & I don‚Äôt pay attention to them
12-08-2020T02:25:05,Dadrobit,"Mmmm, yeah."
12-08-2020T02:25:39,Dadrobit,"Yeah, Kiabugboy has seen me IRL and Flynn Rider is who he came up with."
12-08-2020T02:26:16,SpazztasticKiwi,kiabugboy
12-08-2020T02:26:22,SpazztasticKiwi,alrighty

12-08-2020T02:26:43,Dadrobit,Another artist in Tom's sphere.
12-08-2020T02:27:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Flynn is actually the product of the lady workers that helped with tangled
12-08-2020T02:27:12,SpazztasticKiwi,they were asked to make the ideal man
12-08-2020T02:27:28,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúEugene‚Äù popped out
12-08-2020T02:27:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"not bad, but not my flavor"
12-08-2020T02:27:58,Dadrobit,Evidently center parting your hair like it's 1998 still is ideal.
12-08-2020T02:28:32,Dadrobit,It's worked for me this far.
12-08-2020T02:29:03,SpazztasticKiwi,hair can really center around your face
12-08-2020T02:29:37,SpazztasticKiwi,some shapes should never be seen in certain styles
12-08-2020T02:29:52,SpazztasticKiwi,in the flattering aspect that is
12-08-2020T02:30:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"shaggy hair long hair fluffy hair in the stages of growing out, I don‚Äôt care"
12-08-2020T02:31:14,Dadrobit,"(That's a lie, I had Bieber hair until Bieber happened, then I swapped to center parting to save my dignity)"
12-08-2020T02:31:23,SpazztasticKiwi,but the dude that had that area of hair that came up to my hot case counter with dandruff & leaned over the counter

12-08-2020T02:32:03,SpazztasticKiwi,before a wack you with my spoon

12-08-2020T02:40:28,Dadrobit,"Went back to look at some of those beginning sketches, and man, there are some absolute classics back there..."
12-08-2020T02:41:21,AspiringNoodle,Some day I'm going to go back through everything

12-08-2020T02:55:14,SpazztasticKiwi,that sounds like a boring movie
12-08-2020T02:55:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I got a snake in my room
12-08-2020T02:55:24,Dadrobit,Tell me about it.
12-08-2020T02:55:51,Dadrobit,Dunno if the new guy is up to dealing with wild snake wrangling yet.
12-08-2020T02:56:09,SpazztasticKiwi,you have a partner today
12-08-2020T02:56:52,Dadrobit,I have two guys on truck patrols at all times. One of them is new.
12-08-2020T02:57:09,Dadrobit,I swap with them for any real incidents that need a supervisor.
12-08-2020T02:57:33,Dadrobit,"Snakes usually aren't that, but I'm calling him to make sure he's good."

12-08-2020T03:26:50,TerraTheWizard,double checking the sunday sketch count because everyone has different numbers
12-08-2020T03:26:56,TerraTheWizard,and no one trusts the patreon tag count

12-08-2020T04:05:48,Dadrobit,"I feel that about August. I technically got stuff done this summer, but it feels like I didn't even move."

12-08-2020T04:06:48,Twokinds,Those don't count
12-08-2020T04:07:06,Twokinds,only sketches that say 'suggested by'
12-08-2020T04:08:27,Dadrobit,Didn't help that I spent March/April half dead
12-08-2020T04:09:44,Twokinds,ok
12-08-2020T04:09:47,Twokinds,I'm done
12-08-2020T04:10:06,Dadrobit,Congratulations. Final count?
12-08-2020T04:10:15,Twokinds,"We are currently, as of right now, at 998 sketches, according to my counting."
12-08-2020T04:11:03,Twokinds,"I still don't know why patreon says 993, since I counted them from their website."
12-08-2020T04:11:13,Dadrobit,"So close. We're a few missing tags, or is Patreon just not counting some."
12-08-2020T04:11:26,Dadrobit,Were*
12-08-2020T04:11:30,Dadrobit,Got it.
12-08-2020T04:11:36,Twokinds,They're not missing tags.
12-08-2020T04:12:00,Twokinds,I was checking both with no filters and with 'sunday sketch' filtered and comparing as I went.
12-08-2020T04:12:16,Twokinds,"I actually found one sketch that was mislabled as ""sunday sketch"" that wasn't."
12-08-2020T04:12:22,Twokinds,That was the only error I found.
12-08-2020T04:13:08,SpazztasticKiwi,yay organization
12-08-2020T04:13:09,Dadrobit,Good on you for four years of accurate tagging.
12-08-2020T04:13:18,Dadrobit,Not even joking.
12-08-2020T04:13:34,Twokinds,lol well more thanks to people who get on me when I inevitably make an mistake.
12-08-2020T04:13:37,Twokinds,But I try.
12-08-2020T04:13:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"well when there‚Äôs a mislabel, you know there‚Äôs someone that brings it up so"

12-08-2020T04:14:22,SpazztasticKiwi,the faithful spellcheckers
12-08-2020T04:14:59,Twokinds,Hey! It seems my 998 number lines up with Terra's spreadsheet
12-08-2020T04:15:02,Twokinds,That's good
12-08-2020T04:15:17,Dadrobit,Terra really is a wizard.
12-08-2020T04:15:20,Twokinds,"Always possible for me to miscount, but I did try to double check myself each month."
12-08-2020T04:15:23,SpazztasticKiwi,üåà
12-08-2020T04:15:56,Twokinds,"Random fact: the month I posted the most sketches was May 2020, with 28 sketches."
12-08-2020T04:16:23,iliar,Some time ago I made a large list of posts with errors in tags. But then I thought it was not significant. And no needed distract Tom by correcting mistakes.
12-08-2020T04:16:25,Dadrobit,TheMoreYouKnow.gif
12-08-2020T04:16:29,iliar,"If you have a desire to do some bug fixing, then I could check all the posts again and report any bugs found."
12-08-2020T04:16:55,Twokinds,"I do like to have accurate data, but it's such a pain in the butt."
12-08-2020T04:17:33,Twokinds,"Also a lot of the early ones have problems not due to my own fault, but simply because Patreon only allowed like, 5 tags, originally"
12-08-2020T04:17:42,Twokinds,"Or 6, some small number."
12-08-2020T04:17:50,Twokinds,So I could only list a few characters.

12-08-2020T04:18:34,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I was gonna ask if maybe the limited tagging from early on was what was causing conflicts."
12-08-2020T04:18:59,Twokinds,Yeahh
12-08-2020T04:19:01,Twokinds,heheh
12-08-2020T04:19:53,iliar,"There used to be a limit of 5 tags, so you couldn't add all the tags you wanted."
12-08-2020T04:20:07,Twokinds,I would always try to add the most relevent characters.
12-08-2020T04:20:39,Dadrobit,So Keith and Natani
12-08-2020T04:20:54,iliar,Plus sometimes you have a problem that you call one character with different tags.
12-08-2020T04:21:20,iliar,Although I try to track such errors.
12-08-2020T04:22:40,Twokinds,That's hopefully not an issue anymore.
12-08-2020T04:22:54,Twokinds,I do appreciate all the help.
12-08-2020T04:23:01,Twokinds,I wouldn't be able to do all this alone.
12-08-2020T04:23:32,iliar,In my gallery I solved this problem. When I add tags I have a list of all tags. And I just need to click on the desired one. There is no alias names error.
