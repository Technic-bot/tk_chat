18-08-2020T00:00:17,AspiringNoodle,A mysterious ancient civilization that disappeared but left behind extremely powerful technology
18-08-2020T00:00:30,AspiringNoodle,And a mysterious force that pervades the Abyss and the surrounding area
18-08-2020T00:01:03,CrRAR,"just think of it as any human exploitable subject, like in sci-fi most horrible things come from pushing science to an extreme or going to a point beyond natural order"
18-08-2020T00:01:16,CrRAR,The Abyss kinda is emblematic of that
18-08-2020T00:01:34,CrRAR,The deeper you go the further you stray the weirder it gets
18-08-2020T00:02:15,CrRAR,Rhings that make sense get horribly skewed
18-08-2020T00:02:26,CrRAR,Humanity gets buried deeper~
18-08-2020T00:02:48,CrRAR,the thing you sought to chase becomes more disrespected and trod upon
18-08-2020T00:03:03,AspiringNoodle,Some creatures in the Abyss terrify the ever living *shit* out of me
18-08-2020T00:03:11,AspiringNoodle,Like the birds that mimic the cries of the people they've killed
18-08-2020T00:03:22,CrRAR,haha yeah it is a very imaginative set of creatures
18-08-2020T00:03:47,CrRAR,yeah there are some freaky disturbing things
18-08-2020T00:04:14,CrRAR,there are some cute ones tho
18-08-2020T00:04:32,CrRAR,like the lil puff hamsters things
18-08-2020T00:05:09,CrRAR,and Nanachiiii
18-08-2020T00:05:17,CrRAR,(nyaaaaaa)
18-08-2020T00:06:41,AspiringNoodle,Trying to think of other anime you might like...
18-08-2020T00:08:45,AspiringNoodle,Have you ever watched SAO?
18-08-2020T00:12:47,CrRAR,nope
18-08-2020T00:13:22,AspiringNoodle,"Well, I have something better than it :D"
18-08-2020T00:13:30,AspiringNoodle,Quan Zhi Gao Shou (The King's Avatar*
18-08-2020T00:14:05,AspiringNoodle,It's a Chinanime
18-08-2020T00:15:05,AspiringNoodle,The main plot is that the protagonist is *the* top rated player for an MMORPG.  Basically a super huge celebrity in the country
18-08-2020T00:15:22,CrRAR,nice
18-08-2020T00:15:26,AspiringNoodle,"But ofc, the professional team he was carrying is manned by jealous teammates and a dickbag manager"
18-08-2020T00:15:39,AspiringNoodle,"They pull the old ""you're too old for this shit anymore, and so we're replacing you"" card"
18-08-2020T00:16:26,AspiringNoodle,"And to be EXTRA dickish, the contract more or less makes his character the team's property.  So when they boot him, he can either keep the character and suffer huge fines that'll ruin him, or give up his legacy to some pos who doesn't deserve it"
18-08-2020T00:17:04,AspiringNoodle,"How can they pull this?  The MMO has a unique pull to it.  When you create a character, that character is connected to a physical card that is scanned to grant you access to the game"
18-08-2020T00:17:26,AspiringNoodle,Whoever holds the card holds the character
18-08-2020T00:19:04,AspiringNoodle,"Jokes on them though, he has another character.  It never got far, but it was the character he wanted to improve when he first started playing"
18-08-2020T00:19:27,AspiringNoodle,So the series will follow his return to glory using his personal character
18-08-2020T01:17:34,CrRAR,slep time I think

18-08-2020T15:27:44,CrRAR,never stop never suggesting
18-08-2020T15:27:50,RimaDraws,scuse me asshat?
18-08-2020T15:28:16,AspiringNoodle,Not relating to current chat
18-08-2020T15:28:33,AspiringNoodle,It's wednesday and my family usually goes out to dinner with the grandparents
18-08-2020T15:29:22,AspiringNoodle,That got put on hold for a long while because pandemic shutting things down and my mother having to quarantine for 2 weeks after things opened back up due to needed testing before getting an x-ray
18-08-2020T15:29:45,AspiringNoodle,"I went twice, and my parents just assumed I was going, so my mother got pissy when I asked if I could pass"
18-08-2020T15:30:22,RimaDraws,oh boy
18-08-2020T15:30:30,CrRAR,:<
18-08-2020T15:30:47,RimaDraws,i feel that. my family used to do that with me
18-08-2020T15:31:14,AspiringNoodle,"It's like... people seem to forget that the pandemic is an actual thing, and I work at a gas station of all places"
18-08-2020T15:31:52,AspiringNoodle,"I went out twice, and apparently that was teh big mistake, so now it seems like I'm okay with it"
18-08-2020T15:32:55,AspiringNoodle,"Everything okay at work, Rima?"
18-08-2020T15:33:14,CrRAR,the new xkcd was funny about covid avoidance techniques
18-08-2020T15:33:43,CrRAR,oh I guess 2nd most recent now
18-08-2020T15:34:28,AspiringNoodle,"I'm on the chart one, it's actually pretty accurate"
18-08-2020T15:34:40,AspiringNoodle,"Technically, my job would place me as ""medium risk"""
18-08-2020T15:34:48,CrRAR,lol that was good too
18-08-2020T15:35:06,AspiringNoodle,"For ""essential employees"", there's a 4-step scale"
18-08-2020T15:35:12,AspiringNoodle,"Low, Medium, High, Extreme"
18-08-2020T15:35:33,AspiringNoodle,"Low would be people like postal workers.  Essential, but virtually no contact with people.  Not likely to get infected"
18-08-2020T15:36:06,AspiringNoodle,"Extreme would be hospital workers, who are basically guaranteed to be working with infected patients and run an extremely high risk of catching it"
18-08-2020T15:36:30,AspiringNoodle,"High would be medical workers in general outside hospitals.  Not guaranteed to work with infected patients, but elevated chance of contact due to their profession"
18-08-2020T15:36:43,AspiringNoodle,And then there's lil' ol' me.
18-08-2020T15:36:51,CrRAR,yeah some places treat 'essential' designation as being deemed immune haha
18-08-2020T15:37:28,AspiringNoodle,"Medium = Elevated risk of contact with an infected person, but relatively small chance due to working with the general public"
18-08-2020T15:52:00,RimaDraws,like i have to wear a mask everywhere i go because work asks us to keep each other safe
18-08-2020T15:52:34,CrRAR,yeah good practice is good habit

18-08-2020T17:58:10,CrimsonQuill,I'm actually trying to draw the third page of a comic with her and some Halo OCs from another person (along with one of my own)
18-08-2020T17:58:24,CrimsonQuill,It's...tricky to get the proportions right.
18-08-2020T17:58:44,CrimsonQuill,And I'm trying to keep her as close to her original personality as can be
18-08-2020T17:59:06,CrimsonQuill,I do want to work her floofyness in though
18-08-2020T17:59:27,CrRAR,yeah armor does kinda mangle all hope for judging that
18-08-2020T17:59:56,CrimsonQuill,judging the floofyness you mean
18-08-2020T17:59:58,CrRAR,"you can kinda tell what body parts should look like and how they fit, but armor is quite synthetic"

18-08-2020T18:14:17,CrimsonQuill,I suppose the whole project is fanart...
