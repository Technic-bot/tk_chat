18-06-2020T20:20:25,SageSaga,these dogs are still active- but its because they dont get out enough- my sister should never have gotten them- they arent active enough for them so now they have all sorts of health problems
18-06-2020T20:20:58,SageSaga,animals should go to homes that can care for them- not to people who just want a pet

18-06-2020T21:00:17,Rainelover,Because she probably is
18-06-2020T21:00:22,Roughlandin,I think it's the skirt and heels combo

18-06-2020T22:03:51,LogicIsHere,Because the main narrative is Humans and Keidrans
18-06-2020T22:04:01,Roughlandin,They're a hoax created by the dragons to keep everybody in line

18-06-2020T22:09:13,Roughlandin,Mispelled always looks mispelled to me
18-06-2020T22:09:34,KeefMcDerpface,My brain auto-corrects on some things....
18-06-2020T22:09:41,beastlee99,If I look at any word too long it looks mispelled

18-06-2020T22:10:15,Roughlandin,All rumors of Mrs. Nibbly being a dragon are just that... rumors.
18-06-2020T22:10:17,MoonDance,Believe has been a word that feels wrong to spell

18-06-2020T22:11:13,beastlee99,"Another question, Euchre's Flawless Transformation is magic, right? But Keidrans can't use magic without a crystal. How did he do it in the first place?"
18-06-2020T22:11:13,Roughlandin,Pay no attention to the dragon behind the squirrely curtains
18-06-2020T22:11:25,MoonDance,well later on if you can't get a hold of them now

18-06-2020T22:11:48,Ordithus,I believe his transformation is more a natural ability than magic in the normal sense
18-06-2020T22:11:52,Roughlandin,@beastlee99: There's... a lot of funky stuff with Euchre. Hopefully it gets adressed some this chapter
18-06-2020T22:12:00,beastlee99,So he's a shapeshifter
18-06-2020T22:12:02,USNMM3,herself*
18-06-2020T22:12:05,beastlee99,With two shapes

18-06-2020T22:12:25,Ordithus,Raine can transform back to human without a crystal
18-06-2020T22:12:30,Roughlandin,"Can't shapeshift your accent though, apparently"
18-06-2020T22:12:34,Roughlandin,But Raine is human
18-06-2020T22:12:35,KeefMcDerpface,yep
18-06-2020T22:12:42,beastlee99,I guess more than two shapes because Raine has it too and she can be halfling version

18-06-2020T22:13:03,Roughlandin,I mean her default form is human

18-06-2020T22:13:39,beastlee99,Didn't she say she was either born a Keidran or transformed into one soon after she was born?
18-06-2020T22:13:40,USNMM3,I wonder if Trace and Flora's child will be able to shape shift..
18-06-2020T22:13:48,beastlee99,Like she doesn't know
18-06-2020T22:13:58,KeefMcDerpface,Look into her ref sheet.
18-06-2020T22:14:04,Roughlandin,I think Raine's ref sheet clarifies stuff

18-06-2020T22:16:49,Ordithus,She's human because Mary is human and Euchre was in human form
18-06-2020T22:17:02,Roughlandin,And Euchre's... weird.
18-06-2020T22:17:05,Ordithus,It - is - flawless transformation

18-06-2020T22:17:45,Roughlandin,So Raine's keidran form has more to do with Mary's curse than Euchre's wolf genes
18-06-2020T22:17:46,beastlee99,I see
18-06-2020T22:17:56,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floraquestion: which makes me question much of what I've said in the past about aging
18-06-2020T22:18:11,Ordithus,It has entirely to do with Euchre
18-06-2020T22:18:15,KeefMcDerpface,But... Mary was cursed after she gave birth. No?
18-06-2020T22:18:18,Ordithus,Mary was only curese like 4 years ago
18-06-2020T22:18:21,Roughlandin,Ah

18-06-2020T23:34:58,SageSaga,talent is just a word people use to downplay our hard work and effort

18-06-2020T23:38:56,SageSaga,you start with a pencil and paper usually
18-06-2020T23:39:05,Roughlandin,"Oh, hey. I owe that guy a couple million bells"
18-06-2020T23:39:10,Nekonny,and then add 16 years
18-06-2020T23:39:14,Roughlandin,Bout the same I owe in student loans...
18-06-2020T23:39:21,RevGaming,crayon and a wall was my start

18-06-2020T23:39:57,SageSaga,they dont have the 3300 one anymore
18-06-2020T23:40:00,Nekonny,^_^
18-06-2020T23:40:02,USNMM3,"I can draw, but REQUIRE a reference for it... But can do poetry quite well, even if it ISN'T as popular.."
18-06-2020T23:40:10,Ordithus,"yes, clearly the equipment is what makes the art!"
18-06-2020T23:40:17,Roughlandin,"Everybody knows the real way to start art is with a $60,000 Deep Dive Haptic VR Rig"
18-06-2020T23:40:18,SageSaga,also i talked to someone at Wacom- they said they think new wacom tablets are going to be coming out soon
18-06-2020T23:40:19,hyneria,who would pay that much money for an art tablet?...
18-06-2020T23:40:29,Stormagedon,I just don't do organic shapes very well
18-06-2020T23:40:30,Roughlandin,...Not Tom
18-06-2020T23:40:34,NezumiYuki,Just came back from grabbin more spaghetti...  Why's Tom quiet?
18-06-2020T23:40:37,Ordithus,Who needs practice when you have money :ctwokinds-clovischuckle:
18-06-2020T23:40:42,Roughlandin,"Bobs are organic, Storm"
18-06-2020T23:40:46,Nekonny,TTom pays in bells
18-06-2020T23:40:46,Twokinds,Yeah it's a waste of money anyway
18-06-2020T23:40:49,SageSaga,hyneria- thats not just a tablet- its a computer built into the tablet
18-06-2020T23:41:04,Stormagedon,"I know Rough... I know, can't figure them out"
18-06-2020T23:41:09,hyneria,like a surface pro?
18-06-2020T23:41:18,SageSaga,except a wacom
18-06-2020T23:41:24,SageSaga,surface pro is not a wacom
18-06-2020T23:41:26,hyneria,$3500 is still too much
18-06-2020T23:41:34,SageSaga,its a 4k display
18-06-2020T23:41:41,Ordithus,surface pro is nice but yeah sage is right about that
18-06-2020T23:41:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Surface pro is wacom enough
18-06-2020T23:41:45,Stormagedon,I'll stick to pencil and paper for now
18-06-2020T23:41:46,Roughlandin,"( . ) ( . ) <= Do like dat, Storm"
18-06-2020T23:41:49,Ordithus,lewd
18-06-2020T23:41:51,hyneria,I guess if you are a big studio you can give one to your artists
18-06-2020T23:41:54,Roughlandin,Hehehe
18-06-2020T23:41:57,USNMM3,"I'm actually LOVING Tom's art style, and the storyline of Twokinds is ADDICTING."
18-06-2020T23:41:58,Stormagedon,"Rough, easier said then done"
18-06-2020T23:41:59,beastlee99,ascii art
18-06-2020T23:42:02,hyneria,but a freelancer owning one sounds crazy

18-06-2020T23:47:15,SageSaga,and it doesnt matter- 2000px brush at 300DPI will lag anything
18-06-2020T23:47:19,MatyMaty,the specs seem kinda weak
18-06-2020T23:47:20,NezumiYuki,Colin doing the Slav Squat!

18-06-2020T23:50:45,Roughlandin,Last week Tom said the Sam and Colin comic would fill about one TK volume worth of content
18-06-2020T23:50:49,beastlee99,Is that the same one as the Willow-wisp girl?
