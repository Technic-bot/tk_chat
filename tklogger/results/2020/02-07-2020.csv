02-07-2020T00:17:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"other than that, anything interesting here"
02-07-2020T00:29:28,SpazztasticKiwi,oh and patreon is unhelpful as usual
02-07-2020T00:55:14,AspiringNoodle,I'm just waiting for Patreon to collapse because they keep kicking off their big money earners (or scaring them away)
02-07-2020T00:57:20,AspiringNoodle,"Don't want it to happen, obviously.  So many people are making a living off of Patreon, and they don't need to deal with the stress, shock, and potential income loss from having to pick and move to a new platform"
02-07-2020T01:06:32,SpazztasticKiwi,nice soapbox

02-07-2020T20:33:01,Rosscoe,"When in doubt, there is medical donars"
02-07-2020T20:33:04,SageSaga,if he wants them to have it they can o_o
02-07-2020T20:33:10,Nekonny,"I probably do need to draw more guys, yes"
02-07-2020T20:33:11,Rosscoe,XD
02-07-2020T20:33:33,Mihari,"The one guy he does have, he draws as a girl 90% of the time XD"
02-07-2020T20:33:40,Ordithus,he also has Taco
02-07-2020T20:33:41,Rosscoe,This is true
02-07-2020T20:33:44,Mihari,That doesn't count.
02-07-2020T20:33:46,Rainelover,No! Draw as many girls as you want!
02-07-2020T20:33:50,Rosscoe,Taco doesnt count XD
02-07-2020T20:33:53,Ordithus,haha
02-07-2020T20:33:57,FoxxTrotter,:taco::taco::taco:
02-07-2020T20:34:01,Nekonny,Thats why I follow Sages steam subtitle ot a T
02-07-2020T20:34:12,Rosscoe,"What if when Nekonny become N-chan, the girls become guys o.o"
02-07-2020T20:34:20,Mihari,I'd be ok with that.
02-07-2020T20:34:29,Nekonny,what was that~~~
02-07-2020T20:34:39,Ordithus,Sage has male characters but only ever draws them in the comics!
02-07-2020T20:34:40,Nekonny,*draws male Kimi
02-07-2020T20:34:41,Mihari,He said what if Nekonny became n-chan and all the girls became guys.
02-07-2020T20:35:03,Rosscoe,Kim-Chi :N-Chan how do I work this thing down stairs?
02-07-2020T20:35:09,Nekonny,need sa description for nchan...
02-07-2020T20:35:14,Mihari,You assume I think male Kimi would look bad :P
02-07-2020T20:35:23,Nekonny,the way I draw guys ^_^'
02-07-2020T20:35:30,Mihari,Improve!
02-07-2020T20:35:35,Ordithus,practice makes sexy
02-07-2020T20:35:37,Mihari,Ask Chalo to teach you how to draw beefcake.
02-07-2020T20:35:46,Mihari,XD
02-07-2020T20:35:51,Rainelover,Y nobody notice me? 😢
02-07-2020T20:35:53,SageSaga,does Mihari even like Beefcake? XD
02-07-2020T20:36:01,Mihari,It's nice to look at on occasion.
02-07-2020T20:36:06,Rosscoe,"Fem boi Kimi wouldnt be a bad thing, Tina though, shed need work XD"
02-07-2020T20:36:16,Rosscoe,o/ Rain
02-07-2020T20:36:16,Mihari,Tina is a total tomboy
02-07-2020T20:36:25,Mihari,Kimi is no femboi material.
02-07-2020T20:36:28,ZRO4825,"Chalo can definitely draw some beefy fellas, gotta admit that."
02-07-2020T20:36:35,Rosscoe,Kimi a beefcake?
02-07-2020T20:36:38,Rosscoe,Also works
02-07-2020T20:36:43,Mihari,"No, she'd be athletic, but not beefcake"
02-07-2020T20:36:59,Rosscoe,So Swimmer build (going by island shes from)
02-07-2020T20:37:07,Rainelover,Even the woman have abs when chalo is in town
02-07-2020T20:37:09,Mihari,The irony of that XD
02-07-2020T20:37:29,Mihari,Chalo is good at varying body types.
02-07-2020T20:37:32,Rosscoe,Its weird but islanders can hold their breath better then non islanders
02-07-2020T20:37:49,Ordithus,how is that weird?
02-07-2020T20:38:06,Rosscoe,"gentic make up from years of living out of the ocean,"
02-07-2020T20:38:21,Rosscoe,anyrate I must go to work! Im 8 minutes late getting changed
02-07-2020T20:38:24,Rosscoe,laters all!

02-07-2020T20:38:31,FoxxTrotter,"C-yas, Rosscoe."
02-07-2020T20:38:31,Mihari,Take care!
02-07-2020T20:38:32,Nekonny,I should ask chalo for some pointers I guess XD
02-07-2020T20:38:32,Tharkis,"even though chalo draws lots of HUUUUGGGEEEE chests, chalo can draw other stuff quite well too , as Mihari said =D"
02-07-2020T20:38:41,Nekonny,he's downstairs playing on the switch
02-07-2020T20:38:45,Tharkis,the art chalo did for me in my sketch book is <3
02-07-2020T20:38:46,Mihari,XD
02-07-2020T20:38:48,Nekonny,don't think he'll be joing today
02-07-2020T20:39:16,Mihari,Must not buy time sync 2020 for switch!
02-07-2020T20:39:28,SageSaga,he got stuck in the worse country for this
02-07-2020T20:40:13,Mihari,"I dunno about that Sage, USA might be pretty stupid, but Mexico isn't much better from what I hear."
02-07-2020T20:40:34,SageSaga,but Chalo isnt from Mexico
02-07-2020T20:40:40,BLADEDGE,"well...some parts of the US are Pretty Stupid, @Mihari"
02-07-2020T20:41:00,Mihari,He'd have gotten stuck in Mexico trying to get back to El Salvador
02-07-2020T20:41:03,Nekonny,His choices were either mexico or the US
02-07-2020T20:41:18,Nekonny,3 days voting should be enough I think?
02-07-2020T20:41:25,SageSaga,well We're number one atm- take that Mexico
02-07-2020T20:41:25,Ordithus,I would think so
02-07-2020T20:41:33,Mihari,XD
02-07-2020T20:41:39,Nekonny,Winning! \o/

02-07-2020T20:42:23,Ordithus,I'd like to be mediocre for once
02-07-2020T20:42:45,Nekonny,XD
02-07-2020T20:42:51,SageSaga,we should try winning at something else maybe- oh! what about education or literacy?
02-07-2020T20:43:07,Nekonny,"Ok, Ive posted the poll for the pinup  character ,"

02-07-2020T20:51:58,SageSaga,havent had time yet to go kick that elderdragons butt yet
02-07-2020T20:52:22,unsteddyphoenix,it'll wait
02-07-2020T20:52:38,ZRO4825,Don't believe it's actually IN quite yet. :o
02-07-2020T20:53:38,SageSaga,oh right it goes in Thursday
02-07-2020T20:54:11,ZRO4825,"Try to log in every day till then. Free lv.4 Jewels, starting off with an Expert today, one of each elemental jewel each subsequent day, and ending with an Attack jewel."
02-07-2020T20:54:45,SageSaga,i probably dont need em
02-07-2020T20:55:14,johnnytho,Pokemon music
02-07-2020T20:55:14,SageSaga,pretty sure the only jewels im missing are some of the combo jewels
02-07-2020T20:55:22,Albejorn,"Say, I have a quick question. I'm a new streamer on picarto... why does the chat keep getting reset to ""No Guests""?"
02-07-2020T20:55:37,Nekonny,thats default
02-07-2020T20:55:49,CrRAR,yeah probably to prevent insanity
02-07-2020T20:56:13,Albejorn,"But I change it in the control panel to Everyone, refresh an anonymous browser that's a ""viewer,"" and it still says ""Streamer has set access level to: No guests"""
02-07-2020T20:56:40,SageSaga,my stream is set to no guests
02-07-2020T20:56:48,CrimsonHelsing,"Really, Tom? What's up? .3."
02-07-2020T20:56:55,Albejorn,"Kind of frustrating. I sent a link to my followers and already had 30 people swing by, but no way to interact with them."
02-07-2020T20:57:27,Albejorn,"Didn't mean to derail, carry on. Thanks for the insight. >.<"
02-07-2020T20:57:29,ZRO4825,"""No guests"" doesn't mean that no one can interact. It just means that no one without a picarto account can talk in your channel, iirc."
02-07-2020T20:57:30,SageSaga,if they have picarto accounts they should be able to chat
02-07-2020T20:58:37,Albejorn,"Well, my followers are coming in from a different social media platform. At least to give them a taste, I'd wanted the first few streams to be easier to up engagement. Just frustrating the option's there with no reason why it's being unset."
02-07-2020T20:59:03,Albejorn,"But, I don't want to harsh the vibe. Sorry to barge in!!"
02-07-2020T20:59:10,SageSaga,just like most streaming platforms you need to have an account to chat
02-07-2020T20:59:59,Albejorn,Fair enough!
02-07-2020T21:00:20,Albejorn,:hugging:
02-07-2020T21:00:21,Mihari,My poor cat is freaking out cause no where is safe from the loud booms of Sea World's fireworks!
02-07-2020T21:00:45,BadFoMo,Poor think.
02-07-2020T21:00:51,CrRAR,:crying_cat_face:
02-07-2020T21:00:52,BadFoMo,*thing.
02-07-2020T21:01:10,SageSaga,cast silence
02-07-2020T21:01:22,Mihari,dun have that
02-07-2020T21:01:25,CrRAR,I wondered if cats had the same reaction to fireworks.
02-07-2020T21:01:44,CrRAR,"Like, as dogs do"
02-07-2020T21:01:44,Nekonny,"I saw this one video today of a dog, going into the bathroom and turning on the fan to create white noise and drown it out"
02-07-2020T21:01:46,SageSaga,rest for an hour and - well the fireworks will probably be over by then-
02-07-2020T21:04:21,Mihari,"Well, most fireworks don't bother her, but Sea World is REALLY close and they use those industrial fireworks, so they can get pretty loud and boomy."
02-07-2020T21:04:49,CrRAR,"ah, I see"
02-07-2020T21:05:06,SageSaga,the shockwave is bit of an issue for really sensitive ears
02-07-2020T21:05:17,CrimsonHelsing,Perfectly understandable
02-07-2020T21:05:37,CrRAR,Someone needs to invent FluffMuffs
02-07-2020T21:05:37,SageSaga,if the boom is enough to shake or rattle the house you can imagine what it does to a sensitive ear
02-07-2020T21:05:42,CrRAR,EarMuffs for Fluffs
02-07-2020T21:05:50,CrRAR,yeah
02-07-2020T21:06:26,zombiegamer,Heya Nekonny
02-07-2020T21:06:28,CrRAR,"The ones people can barely hear make dogs freak out though too, I know their ears are more sensitive, but it seems like an overreaction"
02-07-2020T21:06:29,BadFoMo,"@CrRAR I was thinking that too, but how to do it?"
02-07-2020T21:06:37,CrRAR,"lol, ikr"
02-07-2020T21:06:52,CrRAR,they'd probably just scruff them off
02-07-2020T21:07:09,SageSaga,thats because the high frequencies are really annoying to hear
02-07-2020T21:07:19,CrRAR,oh that is a good point
02-07-2020T21:07:33,CrRAR,the other frequencies we aren't so able to hear
02-07-2020T21:07:47,SageSaga,they are unnerving - and when everyone else is acting normal while you feel like your gonna go scanners- makes people even more worried
02-07-2020T21:07:57,CrRAR,hahaha
02-07-2020T21:08:45,BadFoMo,The only other thing I can think of is to sound proff a room and put the cat in there.
02-07-2020T21:08:58,CrRAR,Cats do love boxes

02-07-2020T21:49:37,RimaDraws,Yee my brother helped me out
02-07-2020T21:49:54,SageSaga,what was the issue?
02-07-2020T21:50:12,RimaDraws,It was the tower power button. It was short circuited
02-07-2020T21:50:22,RimaDraws,So he made me a make shift one till I can get a new case
02-07-2020T21:50:37,Grip,"Ah, have had that issue before."
02-07-2020T21:50:38,RimaDraws,It works just fine now
02-07-2020T21:50:42,SageSaga,o_O how does a power button short circuit?
02-07-2020T21:50:47,RimaDraws,I don’t know
02-07-2020T21:50:51,ryutuisen,happens
02-07-2020T21:50:55,SageSaga,that shouldnt be possible
02-07-2020T21:50:58,SageSaga,its a switch
02-07-2020T21:51:06,SageSaga,its one of the easiest things in electronics
02-07-2020T21:51:19,RimaDraws,Not sure but I’m glad it works now
02-07-2020T21:51:23,MachGao,chalo
02-07-2020T21:51:25,SageSaga,"its legit ""now it connects- now it doesnt"""
02-07-2020T21:51:26,MachGao,who is that cow gal
02-07-2020T21:51:26,ryutuisen,actualy if it is poorly made it actualy can break
02-07-2020T21:51:28,Ordithus,Rima!
02-07-2020T21:51:28,MachGao,i love her
02-07-2020T21:51:31,Grip,Depending on the type it goes to a small bouard through a wire.
02-07-2020T21:51:32,RimaDraws,Hi ord
02-07-2020T21:51:35,Grip,*board
02-07-2020T21:52:09,RimaDraws,Ord I’m gonna whisper something I drew today. Wanna show you
02-07-2020T21:52:21,Mihari,It was most likely not attached to the correct pins I imagine.
02-07-2020T21:52:27,Mihari,The switch I mean.
02-07-2020T21:52:35,RimaDraws,Hi mihari
02-07-2020T21:52:39,SageSaga,if that was all the problem was you could have just turned it on with a screwdriver
02-07-2020T21:54:35,ryutuisen,"hhhhmm need to draw later more on my beach pinups , currently managed to stuck on the pose -.-"
02-07-2020T21:56:43,Mihari,Hello
02-07-2020T21:58:28,SageSaga,so i cant decided if i wanna quit this new light novel series or not- its got parts i like- but the harem element is really annoying
02-07-2020T21:58:52,BLADEDGE,Uh-oh...I know what's gonna happen in what Neko's drawin'
02-07-2020T21:59:13,SageSaga,predictable
02-07-2020T21:59:22,SteelDragonFist,Hey folks
02-07-2020T22:00:00,CrRAR,heyo
02-07-2020T22:00:20,RimaDraws,Hi CrRAR
02-07-2020T22:00:23,SageSaga,all the harem stuff is just so predictable and annoying
02-07-2020T22:00:48,ryutuisen,yeah i feel ya sage
02-07-2020T22:00:50,CrRAR,ello rima c:
02-07-2020T22:01:01,SageSaga,but the story is interesting- but there is so much focus on the harem
02-07-2020T22:01:16,CrRAR,tea :ccrrar-katsip:
02-07-2020T22:01:17,Tharkis,i've been enjoying several different light novel and manga series
02-07-2020T22:01:19,SteelDragonFist,How's it going?
02-07-2020T22:01:19,unsteddyphoenix,Do you think that it'll end with the mc not picking anyone!?
02-07-2020T22:01:19,CrRAR,and ice cream acquired :ctwokinds-reniderp::ice_cream:
02-07-2020T22:01:22,ryutuisen,which lightnovel is it?
02-07-2020T22:01:25,SageSaga,theres like 12 girls now- and i have no idea who half of them are
02-07-2020T22:01:35,Tharkis,"shield hero is actually really good and at like 17 books, 19 if you include the 2 side novels"
02-07-2020T22:01:52,Tharkis,"reincarnated as a sword is predictable but fun, and Fran is a cutie catgirl"
02-07-2020T22:02:06,Tharkis,Dungeon Meshi manga is really unique and cute
02-07-2020T22:02:35,Tharkis,"made in abyss rocks, but the manga is so slow in coming out that you end up waiting 9 to 12 months between books"
02-07-2020T22:02:40,ryutuisen,reading dungeon meshi makes me hungry
02-07-2020T22:02:42,SageSaga,This one is called- The World's Strongest Rearguard
02-07-2020T22:03:08,CrRAR,“Rearguard” :ptv-ohmy:
02-07-2020T22:03:14,Tharkis,dungeon meshi makes me hungry for japanese food >_<
02-07-2020T22:03:20,Tharkis,cooked with monster parts
02-07-2020T22:03:25,Tharkis,:ctharkis-uneasy:
02-07-2020T22:03:35,ryutuisen,hehehehe tharkis next year gonna eat japanese food again i hope
02-07-2020T22:03:46,Tharkis,hope so
02-07-2020T22:04:09,BLADEDGE,She's Baaaaaaack!
02-07-2020T22:04:24,SageSaga,"im looking forward to -  I'm a Behemoth, an S-Ranked Monster, but Mistaken for a Cat, I Live as an Elf Girl's Pet"
02-07-2020T22:04:26,ryutuisen,"sage that wasnt that with the son , his adoptive mom and 2 sisters are an isekaied?"
02-07-2020T22:04:39,SageSaga,no
02-07-2020T22:04:50,ryutuisen,kk
02-07-2020T22:05:20,ryutuisen,still could be worse ya pick up some interessting fantasy stuff and the only think they do is fucking
02-07-2020T22:05:20,ChaosSepher,"Digging the shortstack cow there Chalo, whomever she is"
02-07-2020T22:05:22,SageSaga,a 29 year old office worker and a bunch of other people die and go to a world where they reincarnate people as adventurers
02-07-2020T22:05:23,Tharkis,wait... is that an actual one coming out Sage?
02-07-2020T22:05:29,ChaosSepher,reminds me of my beefy bison babe Odina
02-07-2020T22:05:33,SageSaga,yes it comes out later this month Tharkis
02-07-2020T22:05:35,Tharkis,because i'd read the heck out of a bhemeoth kitty lol
02-07-2020T22:05:41,Tharkis,need to put that on my list lol
02-07-2020T22:05:49,Grip,I like Starting From Today I'll Work As A City Lord and  Cheat Kusushi no Slow Life: Isekai ni Tsukurou Drugstore
02-07-2020T22:05:53,Tharkis,"i was going to start ""so what i'm a spider"" when i finish reincarnated as a sword"
02-07-2020T22:06:25,ryutuisen,had that interessting manga i picked up first chapter was good with the whole wanting revenge on the guys who betrayed the heroine but in chap2 until 6 they only having sex-.-
02-07-2020T22:06:33,SageSaga,my only gripe with Reincarnated as a sword is that it focuses too much on torture as a way to continue the story
02-07-2020T22:06:40,ryutuisen,Iam a spider so what is quite fun
02-07-2020T22:07:38,Twokinds,torture?
02-07-2020T22:07:58,ryutuisen,"well started overly cautious hero again , mostly cause on char that got killed off quite earlier i liked comes back"
02-07-2020T22:08:03,Grip,Sounds like you read Isekai Meikyuu de Harem o/
02-07-2020T22:08:06,ChaosSepher,"as far as isekai's go, Overlord will always be one of my favorites"
02-07-2020T22:08:20,SageSaga,"yeah they are like ""man we dont know enough about this thing to keep going- hey! these guys are bad- im gonna cut off their limbs and heal them over and over till they tell us what we need to know to continue!"""
02-07-2020T22:08:27,ChaosSepher,like the anime to the point I actually started collecting and reading the light novels
02-07-2020T22:08:43,ChaosSepher,....yikes
02-07-2020T22:09:02,ChaosSepher,see now that I would expect from Ainz
02-07-2020T22:09:25,SageSaga,"""Oh no! he tried to commit suicide by drinking poison! *Cure Poison* ""Now talk or i start hacking off body parts!"""
02-07-2020T22:09:50,SonGojin,....what the hell did I just walk in on?
02-07-2020T22:10:04,Grip,"A nice one I have been reading has been, sorry for the long title in advance."
02-07-2020T22:10:05,Grip,DEMON KINGS TOWN PLANNING! ~THE STRONGEST DUNGEON IS A MODERN CITY~
02-07-2020T22:10:27,SageSaga,lame ways some light novels use torture to continue their narrative
02-07-2020T22:10:37,ryutuisen,ah heard of that think only read 5 chaps so far
02-07-2020T22:10:48,Flake,hello
02-07-2020T22:11:18,ryutuisen,sage then dont start trapper hunter of wicked heros
02-07-2020T22:11:24,SageSaga,dont see that one on Kindle Grip
02-07-2020T22:11:32,Werewing,Is that why Kaylin is super persuasive instead of pure intimidation all the time?
02-07-2020T22:12:00,SageSaga,Torture doesnt work most of the time IRL and i dont think we should make it work in shows and stories
02-07-2020T22:12:11,Grip,Oh. Let me give you the other title.
02-07-2020T22:12:25,Werewing,Agreed. People actually take stories seriously for that stuff...for some reason.
02-07-2020T22:12:36,ryutuisen,"one novel i picked up, mostly cause had nothing else to read lately on my nightshifts in the hospital , was my reincarnation as the piggy duke"
02-07-2020T22:12:55,SageSaga,people in the US think Torture works because of stuff like the show 24
02-07-2020T22:13:00,SageSaga,it's so dumb
02-07-2020T22:13:06,ryutuisen,jop
02-07-2020T22:13:21,SageSaga,i liked 24 for the most part- but i feel like too many people took it seriously
02-07-2020T22:13:53,ryutuisen,"i mean honestly there are better less bloody ways to get informations, using torture in storys i mostly to  let steam off or just an cheap plotdevice"
02-07-2020T22:13:55,ChaosSepher,Ever see the series Burn Notice?   Great take on spy techniques
02-07-2020T22:13:55,Ordithus,I'd tell my torturers cat girls are my greatest fear
02-07-2020T22:14:05,Grip,Maou-sama no Machizukuri! ~Saikyou no Danjon wa Kindai Toshi~
02-07-2020T22:14:39,SageSaga,there is no way thats on Kindle Grip
02-07-2020T22:14:52,Werewing,"I've seen Burn Notice, they still use torture, just not physical torture."
02-07-2020T22:15:04,Grip,"Ah, I read it on KissManga and LHtranslation."
02-07-2020T22:15:12,neocloud88h,I'm thinking of buying a Kindle to read manga/light novels on
02-07-2020T22:15:49,neocloud88h,Would you recommend it Sage?
02-07-2020T22:16:00,SageSaga,i dont use sites like that Grip- i prefer official translations so the people who make them get paid- though has Kissmanga been trying to go legit?
02-07-2020T22:16:11,SageSaga,yes Neo i would- a small kindle is great for reading books on
02-07-2020T22:16:19,Grip,I am unsure.
02-07-2020T22:16:38,neocloud88h,Cool.
02-07-2020T22:16:57,SageSaga,i know some of those fan translations and illegal sites have been trying to become legit
02-07-2020T22:17:10,SageSaga,but i havent looked into Kissanime or Kissmanga going legit yet
02-07-2020T22:17:54,Grip,I found the title that might be on kindle. Dungeon Builder: The Demon King's Labyrinth is a Modern City!
02-07-2020T22:18:13,SageSaga,If Kaylin is going to hurt someone because shes angry shes going to hurt them- shes not going to use that to get information out of them- Nyna would try but again- its ineffective
02-07-2020T22:19:12,Nekonny,Not sure which pose to go with...
02-07-2020T22:19:19,SageSaga,is it a light novel?
02-07-2020T22:19:32,SageSaga,or is this a manga-
02-07-2020T22:19:54,SageSaga,Kindle isnt great at telling - but it says its from Comixology and most of those are manga-
02-07-2020T22:20:03,BLADEDGE,I'd go with this one: https://www.dropbox.com/s/212y0ml3604si7k/screenshot%202020-07-03%2022.19.43.png?dl=0
02-07-2020T22:20:05,ChaosSepher,"admittedly Artificial Incident does make me think of Overlord, at least in the overleveled character protag sort of way"
02-07-2020T22:20:07,Grip,Its a manga.
02-07-2020T22:20:16,SageSaga,boo
02-07-2020T22:20:44,Nekonny,"yeah, leaning more twards that one ^^"
02-07-2020T22:21:06,Grip,"And has a light novel,"
02-07-2020T22:21:31,Grip,Looks like eight volumes.
02-07-2020T22:21:43,Grip,"Whoops, ten I mean."
02-07-2020T22:21:49,SageSaga,dont see any of it on kindle
02-07-2020T22:22:54,ryutuisen,"kindle is kinda slow with that ,example so far as i know overly cautious hero is at vol 3 there but far as i got on vol 6"
02-07-2020T22:23:06,Grip,Looks like only the manga are there
02-07-2020T22:23:12,ryutuisen,oh wait if i count my friends translations in is actualy vol 7
02-07-2020T22:23:21,SageSaga,thats not Kindle being slow
02-07-2020T22:23:41,ryutuisen,i mean to pick up on the volumes hehehe
02-07-2020T22:24:02,ryutuisen,sry i had nightshifts and is early in the morning couldnt sleep so far
02-07-2020T22:24:19,SageSaga,kindle distributes- they dont translate- other companies do the translating
02-07-2020T22:24:28,Grip,Seven Seas Entertainment is only doing the manga it looks like.
02-07-2020T22:24:58,ryutuisen,yeah was more meaning that the company who translate it is slow on that
02-07-2020T22:25:00,SageSaga,for reading- Manga is a bad value
02-07-2020T22:25:29,Grip,Skeleton Knight in Another World does have a light novel though.
02-07-2020T22:25:36,lobopunk,Who's character your drawing?
02-07-2020T22:25:39,SageSaga,uhg- that was horrible
02-07-2020T22:25:52,ryutuisen,depends if the mangaka can catch the lightnovels
02-07-2020T22:26:19,SageSaga,the manga always leaves things out and is shorter
02-07-2020T22:27:21,ryutuisen,yeah thats why said if
02-07-2020T22:27:44,SageSaga,even if they did- its more expensive and cuts things
02-07-2020T22:28:01,ryutuisen,"honestly example i only read of cautious hero the first chaps , cause they showed chaos machina but after that sticked to the light novel"
02-07-2020T22:28:03,SageSaga,the only reason to go for the Manga is if they have an especially good artist
02-07-2020T22:28:30,Grip,Mhm. I like both.
02-07-2020T22:28:45,Tharkis,or if manga is the only way the story is told
02-07-2020T22:28:54,Tharkis,"(dungeon meshi, mad ein abyss, etc)"
02-07-2020T22:29:02,SageSaga,yeah
02-07-2020T22:29:17,Tharkis,but yeah light novels are great.  there's a few i've been reading for over 10 years
02-07-2020T22:29:23,Tharkis,like spice and wolf / wolf & parchment
02-07-2020T22:29:33,aeoronwah,I have never once read a light novel
02-07-2020T22:29:42,SageSaga,i like manga and comics of course- but im also stingy- and most of the time i look at these mangas the art is meh but the story is great- so i prefer to pay once- pay less- and get more
02-07-2020T22:30:02,ryutuisen,spice and wolf is the one my friend is obsessed with
02-07-2020T22:30:18,AspiringNoodle,Uh oh
02-07-2020T22:30:26,AspiringNoodle,No tom Strem?
02-07-2020T22:30:27,SageSaga,I will always recommend Ascendance of a Bookworm for new Lightnovel readers
02-07-2020T22:30:30,SageSaga,it is best
02-07-2020T22:30:37,BLADEDGE,Hehehe...Sailor Moon Refrence Neko is drawing

02-07-2020T22:36:02,Werewing,I don't think Tom was here today.
02-07-2020T22:36:11,aeoronwah,"He was here, just not streaming"
02-07-2020T22:36:13,Nekonny,he was in chat
02-07-2020T22:36:14,SageSaga,Tom said he probably wouldnt stream tonight

02-07-2020T23:00:20,Ordithus,surely it is actual poison
02-07-2020T23:00:23,Werewing,Probably has a lot of catnip.
02-07-2020T23:00:38,SageSaga,liquid death is a real thing
02-07-2020T23:01:00,Ordithus,really?
02-07-2020T23:01:16,SageSaga,google it

02-07-2020T23:21:40,BadFoMo,**** Yeah! Squares!
02-07-2020T23:22:04,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all!
02-07-2020T23:22:07,BadFoMo,Yo.
02-07-2020T23:22:16,Ordithus,hi dadro
02-07-2020T23:22:31,Ordithus,squares!
02-07-2020T23:22:40,aeoronwah,Evenin Dadrobit
02-07-2020T23:23:09,Ordithus,some of these are rectangles
02-07-2020T23:23:13,Ordithus,you lied
02-07-2020T23:23:25,AspiringNoodle,Hoi Dadro :D
02-07-2020T23:23:27,SageSaga,all squares are rectangles- not all rectangles are squares
02-07-2020T23:23:44,aeoronwah,witchcraft
02-07-2020T23:23:56,AspiringNoodle,And then there was one :c
02-07-2020T23:23:57,Dadrobit,"Work is officially putting in a non-zero amount of effort into this ""Covid thing"" since they're taking temps of everyone arriving at work."
02-07-2020T23:24:11,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-shock:
02-07-2020T23:24:16,AspiringNoodle,You mean... they're doing something?!?
02-07-2020T23:24:20,Ordithus,only 4-5 months late but better than never
02-07-2020T23:24:28,Dadrobit,But they can't even quite get that right since the thermometer is broke as hell.
02-07-2020T23:24:50,Dadrobit,"""Huh, you're kinda low Dadrobit. 92F."""
02-07-2020T23:25:08,AspiringNoodle,LMAO
02-07-2020T23:25:11,DNMZ,"Awww, turned away for a few minutes and now Chalo is gone"
02-07-2020T23:25:13,Dadrobit,Low? I think that's hypothermic my dude.
02-07-2020T23:25:18,Ordithus,"if the thermometer says your dead, do you have to work that day?"
02-07-2020T23:25:31,AspiringNoodle,"Nah, I think you get to start collecting your life insurance"
02-07-2020T23:25:56,Ordithus,"carp I can't believe I messed up ""you're"""
02-07-2020T23:26:08,Dadrobit,"Evidently it's reading everyone super low. No one has gone above 96F. ""What do you want me to do, Dadrobit, I'm a security guard, not a doctor."""
02-07-2020T23:26:53,Ordithus,no contact thermometer?
02-07-2020T23:26:57,Dadrobit,Yep
02-07-2020T23:27:06,Ordithus,were you blasting AC into your face?
02-07-2020T23:27:14,AspiringNoodle,"Dadro, think COVID will finally get people moving on the BS workers put up with?"
02-07-2020T23:27:22,Dadrobit,"Nah, I'd been sitting outside my car for a good 10 minutes."
02-07-2020T23:27:46,Dadrobit,It's close to 100 out at the moment.
02-07-2020T23:28:01,BadFoMo,Dang!
02-07-2020T23:28:11,Ordithus,I wonder what a skin temp is when one is sweating to not die
02-07-2020T23:28:17,AspiringNoodle,"""Either you're a zombie... or this thing is broken..."""
02-07-2020T23:28:20,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe you’re coldblooded
02-07-2020T23:28:22,Dadrobit,"Lol, ord"
02-07-2020T23:28:52,SageSaga,if he was i dont think he can get covid?
02-07-2020T23:29:06,SageSaga,i think it cant be passed to cold blooded creatures
02-07-2020T23:29:14,SpazztasticKiwi,mutations mean people can get it again now
02-07-2020T23:29:34,SageSaga,havent seen that confirmed yet Kiwi
02-07-2020T23:29:38,Dadrobit,Don't think it's the sweat. Have had no contact measurements from midday when it's 114 and still only been 98.
02-07-2020T23:29:45,SpazztasticKiwi,even those thermally challenged
02-07-2020T23:30:05,Grip,Good night all
02-07-2020T23:30:10,Ordithus,night grip
02-07-2020T23:30:12,AspiringNoodle,Night grip :D
02-07-2020T23:30:12,BadFoMo,Good night.
02-07-2020T23:30:19,Dadrobit,o/ grip
02-07-2020T23:30:20,SageSaga,take care Grip
02-07-2020T23:30:35,SpazztasticKiwi,merge of don’t stream but pick one
02-07-2020T23:30:38,SpazztasticKiwi,or
02-07-2020T23:30:53,Dadrobit,Merger kicked me for a second there.
02-07-2020T23:31:10,SageSaga,it wasnt a merge it was a demerge
02-07-2020T23:31:25,SpazztasticKiwi,“stream merged-oh wait no we’re not”
02-07-2020T23:31:26,SageSaga,Chalo and Ron left the merge
02-07-2020T23:31:26,Dadrobit,"Yeah, that."
02-07-2020T23:32:07,SpazztasticKiwi,so despite there being noone for tomorrow...
02-07-2020T23:32:15,SpazztasticKiwi,the 4th of July ..
02-07-2020T23:32:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"they didn’t have me scheduled so when I came in today, they wanted to know if I’d work"
02-07-2020T23:32:37,Dadrobit,My golf club resort is opening up for tomorrow.
02-07-2020T23:32:48,SpazztasticKiwi,what could go wrong
02-07-2020T23:33:22,Dadrobit,They shut down for two weeks after both a member and employee tested positive.
02-07-2020T23:33:55,SpazztasticKiwi,what could ~possibly~ go wrong
02-07-2020T23:35:14,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floraquestion: how strong is Callum?
02-07-2020T23:35:17,Dadrobit,Only 80 people are scheduled for golfing tomorrow and they're keeping the bar and eating facilities closed.
02-07-2020T23:35:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"“no snacks, jus golf”"
02-07-2020T23:35:46,SageSaga,if Callum has all of his equipment and spells ready- hes only a few levels from Max
02-07-2020T23:35:58,Ordithus,so pretty close to Kaylin?
02-07-2020T23:36:16,Dadrobit,Golfing is a protected activity as per our governor...
02-07-2020T23:36:21,SageSaga,yeah- Kaylin also isnt a spellcaster- so she has limitations that Magic doesnt- Magic is kinda OP
02-07-2020T23:36:28,Ordithus,nice
02-07-2020T23:36:38,Ordithus,don't judge him on his small stature
02-07-2020T23:36:41,Ordithus,you go boom
02-07-2020T23:36:42,SageSaga,you just are usually forced to be weak physically
02-07-2020T23:36:46,Dadrobit,"Technically so is eating at a restaurant, but the resort is still keeping them closed."
02-07-2020T23:37:19,Dadrobit,The gift shop is still open tho
02-07-2020T23:37:20,SageSaga,Magic users have to rely on spells for quick movements- while warriors and rogue types can just move in crazy ways naturally
02-07-2020T23:37:54,SageSaga,its their main defense against magic- not getting hit-
02-07-2020T23:38:07,SageSaga,unfortunately Magic has crazy AOEs
02-07-2020T23:38:32,SageSaga,even the spells that target often have a wake effect
02-07-2020T23:39:25,SageSaga,"so the defenses against magic are- A - Dodge, B - Magic"
02-07-2020T23:40:00,AspiringNoodle,"Dadro, the uncaringness is abound in the US :/"
02-07-2020T23:40:22,AspiringNoodle,"These days I can't figure out if the people who don't wear masks in public genuinely forget, or are doing so out of spite"
02-07-2020T23:40:27,Ordithus,or C just take it
02-07-2020T23:40:50,Dadrobit,"To be fair, the defense against physical attacks are A- Dodge, and B- physical barriers."
02-07-2020T23:40:57,Ordithus,sometimes I see people wearing masks and I have hope
02-07-2020T23:41:01,SageSaga,not recommended unless you have Magic defenses
02-07-2020T23:41:08,AspiringNoodle,...I choose C
02-07-2020T23:41:10,AspiringNoodle,*boom*
02-07-2020T23:41:12,Ordithus,But then I go somewhere else and then they aren't and I lose that hope
02-07-2020T23:41:13,SageSaga,Physical barriers dont even stop all spells
02-07-2020T23:41:17,AspiringNoodle,...why do I suddenly have bobs?!?
02-07-2020T23:41:20,Dadrobit,Masks are mandatory here.
02-07-2020T23:41:25,AspiringNoodle,What kind of magic was that?!?
02-07-2020T23:41:58,AspiringNoodle,"Same where I live, but so many people don't bother that it's kinda pointless to try enforcing it..."
02-07-2020T23:42:05,aeoronwah,"God I wish masks were mandatory here, nobody here wears them at all"
02-07-2020T23:42:14,Dadrobit,"Actually, I got a wee bit hopeful the other day. Absolutely had to go to the store and actually saw an overwhelming majority of the crowd wearing masks!"
02-07-2020T23:42:29,AspiringNoodle,"Take it from me, even if they were mandatory, you'd probably have a lot of people either outright refusing or constantly ""forgetting"""
02-07-2020T23:43:00,SageSaga,most of the time its been 50/50 when i go to the store- almost everyone is or almost everyone isnt- but the last time i was super pissed
02-07-2020T23:43:15,SageSaga,because a bunch of workers were there with masks on wearing them wrong
02-07-2020T23:43:21,Dadrobit,"When I say ""mandatory here"" I mean at my workplace and at the club. The club no longer fucks around about masks."
02-07-2020T23:43:28,aeoronwah,"Still wish they were,my immune system sucks ass so people wearing masks would be nice"
02-07-2020T23:43:32,SageSaga,pulling them down to talk to people - WTH
02-07-2020T23:43:38,aeoronwah,WTF
02-07-2020T23:43:41,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-keifacepalm:
02-07-2020T23:43:47,AspiringNoodle,"I'm off all of next week, I put in a request 3 weeks ago"
