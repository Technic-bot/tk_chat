08-05-2020T00:39:20,Dadrobit,"My dude, I love my job. But ""Questionable"" is like our management's alma mater."
08-05-2020T00:39:29,NezumiYuki,And Mihari to by extension.  xDD
08-05-2020T00:39:30,Ordithus,:eye:
08-05-2020T00:39:45,unsteddyphoenix,pfft
08-05-2020T00:40:29,NezumiYuki,Well dang! <3   That's one TONED speed kitty!
08-05-2020T00:40:36,Dadrobit,So I legitimately don't know what I'd do if the higher ups went from push to shove with me.
08-05-2020T00:41:42,unsteddyphoenix,Surely they won't. Surely other workers could get sick and sue...somehow
08-05-2020T00:41:53,Dadrobit,On what pay?
08-05-2020T00:42:08,Ordithus,more likely the folks in the whatchamacallit
08-05-2020T00:42:13,Ordithus,community
08-05-2020T00:42:20,Dadrobit,"I make good money because I'm a supervisor, but that's relative. Everyone else is barely above min wage."
08-05-2020T00:42:28,unsteddyphoenix,gofundme some lawyers
08-05-2020T00:42:47,Dadrobit,S'a crowded market at the moment.
08-05-2020T00:42:52,unsteddyphoenix,Hah true
08-05-2020T00:43:48,Dadrobit,Gonna call my doctor tomorrow on his personal and see if he can't get me an updated FMLA to tell work to fuck off right and proper.
08-05-2020T00:44:42,Dadrobit,"I mean, they're even calling me in two days before my last FMLA is supposed to expire. So yeah, questionable fuckery is afoot."
08-05-2020T00:45:25,DarthRexKing,"Sage, What is that song?"
08-05-2020T00:45:33,DarthRexKing,I know I heard it somewhere before. owo
08-05-2020T00:46:27,SageSaga,last song was To The Beginning
08-05-2020T00:46:53,DarthRexKing,"I mean the current one. owo, but thanks."
08-05-2020T00:47:32,SageSaga,the current one was one that changed
08-05-2020T00:47:33,DarthRexKing,Oh never mind. XD

08-05-2020T14:03:09,SageSaga,weeeellll
08-05-2020T14:03:14,SageSaga,connection is crap today
08-05-2020T14:03:28,Ordithus,much stutter
08-05-2020T14:03:46,BadFoMo,...I was just about to ask about that.
08-05-2020T14:04:09,SageSaga,let me check if its my end of Picarto
08-05-2020T14:04:56,BadFoMo,Any takers on Picarto?
08-05-2020T14:05:14,SageSaga,me
08-05-2020T14:05:25,SageSaga,i chose Picarto
08-05-2020T14:05:42,SageSaga,because it is-
08-05-2020T14:06:15,SageSaga,=_=
08-05-2020T14:06:26,BadFoMo,Sorry.
08-05-2020T14:07:07,SageSaga,i wonder if i should just push through and see if it clears up eventually-
08-05-2020T14:07:15,SageSaga,or cancel the stream
08-05-2020T14:08:16,Ordithus,as long as I don't try listening to the music it's tolerable
08-05-2020T14:10:36,Ordithus,though sometimes when this happens the delay becomes quite impressive
08-05-2020T14:11:55,SageSaga,the delay is extreme
08-05-2020T14:12:38,Ordithus,how is 2021? better than 2020?
08-05-2020T14:12:49,BadFoMo,Hmm?
08-05-2020T14:13:29,BadFoMo,Oh... I think I get the joke now.
08-05-2020T14:16:50,BadFoMo,"How is 2021? Well there's this place called SeaLab that has just... I've lost count of how many times it has blown up now. Also, there's still a shortage of toilet paper."
08-05-2020T14:18:26,BadFoMo,I've just now seen the 'Picarto connection status is poor!' message.
08-05-2020T14:18:42,BadFoMo,How bad it the delay?
08-05-2020T14:18:46,SageSaga,exteme
08-05-2020T14:18:53,BadFoMo,Dang.

08-05-2020T14:28:00,SageSaga,i just got an alert that there's going to be a new episode of House on tv tonight-
08-05-2020T14:28:18,SageSaga,house went off the air in 2012...
08-05-2020T14:28:39,CrRAR,haha
08-05-2020T14:28:41,Ordithus,we've entered the time warp
08-05-2020T14:29:10,Ordithus,picarto says you have made a recording
08-05-2020T14:29:20,CrRAR,Special covid quarantine reunion~
08-05-2020T14:29:40,CrRAR,"""It's NOT lupus!"""
08-05-2020T14:31:08,CrRAR,>it most assuredly is not lupus
08-05-2020T14:31:23,CrRAR,(except for that one case that was)
08-05-2020T14:32:25,Ordithus,an episode about getting the flu in a covid world
08-05-2020T14:33:03,SageSaga,i loved how almost always the opening scene of a house episode worked like this-
08-05-2020T14:34:01,SageSaga,"*Follow person around doing something- they suddenly get injured or seem to be in pain- for someone to come up and help and then they say ""No im fine- but you- you dont look so good-"" and like the person is suddenly bleeding from their eyes or something"
08-05-2020T14:34:13,Sclimshady,"House eats a bowl of Vicodin,  yells randomly,  is right"
