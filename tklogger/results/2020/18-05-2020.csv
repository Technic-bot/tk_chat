18-05-2020T18:58:59,AspiringNoodle,"Jojo, I have only one question for you"
18-05-2020T18:59:04,AspiringNoodle,How many mice did you break to do that?
18-05-2020T19:26:30,JojoGD,More like screens

18-05-2020T19:27:54,AspiringNoodle,Want a laugh to feel better?
18-05-2020T19:28:05,AspiringNoodle,Sure
18-05-2020T19:28:13,AspiringNoodle,I'm gonna stop before the reaction though :P
18-05-2020T19:32:07,AspiringNoodle,"""No!... No..."""

18-05-2020T21:03:12,KeefMcDerpface,Now I got a mental image of that sketch Tom did of a Keidran meeting a furry in a fursuit but replace with a Basitin meeting that... image.
18-05-2020T22:26:46,AspiringNoodle,"Man, why am I so obsessed with FPS games?"
18-05-2020T22:27:05,AspiringNoodle,I don't remember being that infatuated with them when I was younger ._.
18-05-2020T22:27:13,JojoGD,Idk
18-05-2020T22:29:07,KeefMcDerpface,For the immersion?
18-05-2020T22:29:55,AspiringNoodle,Maybe I used to play them from time to time
18-05-2020T22:30:18,AspiringNoodle,"When I was younger, I definitely remember bouncing between Battlefield: Bad Company 2, CoD Black Ops 1, MW3, and Battlefield 3"
18-05-2020T22:30:59,AspiringNoodle,"But I also played WoW and other games as well, and didn't seem so focused"
18-05-2020T22:33:11,KeefMcDerpface,Maybe you're not interested in story based games or games with a lot of grinding?
18-05-2020T22:33:25,AspiringNoodle,"Oh trust me, I am on both fronts, lol"
18-05-2020T22:33:41,AspiringNoodle,Otherwise I wouldn't have stuck with WoW for 14 years
18-05-2020T22:34:12,KeefMcDerpface,Well there's only one option...
18-05-2020T22:34:22,AspiringNoodle,"And believe it or not, I completed the campaigns of shooters before hopping into multiplayer :ptv-snicker:"
18-05-2020T22:34:50,KeefMcDerpface,You're addicted.
18-05-2020T22:35:18,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-shock:
18-05-2020T22:38:32,JojoGD,:ptv-laugh:
18-05-2020T22:39:06,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, that is a possibility"
18-05-2020T22:39:12,JojoGD,Yup
18-05-2020T22:39:48,JojoGD,I don‚Äôt want to play 9 circles but it‚Äôs got to be my 9th demon completed :ptv-sad:
18-05-2020T22:40:09,JojoGD,I lost the practice playing it
18-05-2020T22:40:20,AspiringNoodle,"It's also possible that after having played WoW for so long, with the last half-decade being so focused on that game, that I might be used to the routine of a time sink"
18-05-2020T22:41:15,AspiringNoodle,That said... good opportunity to try and channel that habit into something more constructive
18-05-2020T22:49:42,KeefMcDerpface,"In other news, the bunkers in War Zone have been opened."
18-05-2020T22:49:56,KeefMcDerpface,And what did we discovered?
18-05-2020T22:49:59,AspiringNoodle,"The CoD one, right?"
18-05-2020T22:50:05,KeefMcDerpface,Another bunker.
18-05-2020T22:50:12,AspiringNoodle,AHAHAHA
18-05-2020T22:50:15,AspiringNoodle,Bunkerception
18-05-2020T22:50:25,KeefMcDerpface,And good loot.
18-05-2020T22:50:56,AspiringNoodle,I can't find a BR game I like :c
18-05-2020T22:51:10,JojoGD,The only shooter game I ever played was pixel gun. It sucks right now.
18-05-2020T22:51:20,AspiringNoodle,"There's usually some glaring issue that drives me nuts.  Fortnite, ironically, is the best one I've played"
18-05-2020T22:51:28,AspiringNoodle,"The only, and I mean ONLY downside is the size of the map"
18-05-2020T22:52:08,AspiringNoodle,"I can look past the RNG nature of a lot of the guns, I can overlook the building mechanics because there's a high skill curve where high ground != automatic win"
18-05-2020T22:52:23,JojoGD,I though fortnite was dead
18-05-2020T22:52:29,AspiringNoodle,"Far from it, lol"
18-05-2020T22:52:30,KeefMcDerpface,Nope.
18-05-2020T22:52:41,AspiringNoodle,"They rebooted the entire game, and the new map is awesome"
18-05-2020T22:52:53,AspiringNoodle,They went back to basics for a lot of the stuff
18-05-2020T22:53:03,AspiringNoodle,But that downside I mentioned?
18-05-2020T22:53:07,JojoGD,I remained loyal to Minecraft
18-05-2020T22:53:19,AspiringNoodle,I once went afk for 7 or so minutes mid match because I needed to use the bathroom that badly
18-05-2020T22:53:28,AspiringNoodle,"I came back, my character was perfectly safe"
18-05-2020T22:53:29,JojoGD,I played ever since the lite version of PE
18-05-2020T22:53:44,JojoGD,Ande nether reactor core
18-05-2020T22:54:51,AspiringNoodle,It's sad
18-05-2020T22:55:09,AspiringNoodle,"I love Respawn, they're one of the good developers in the AAA industry, and they alone seem to be beating back EA's bad business practices"
18-05-2020T22:55:36,AspiringNoodle,But Apex Legends has been so unstable for me!
18-05-2020T22:56:18,AspiringNoodle,"Also, not sure if I mentioned this in chat earlier, they managed to eff up hit registration with the season 5 update.  No idea how."
18-05-2020T22:56:30,AspiringNoodle,It can be... bad.
18-05-2020T22:56:38,KeefMcDerpface,"TBH, I also forget Apex is owned by EA."
18-05-2020T22:57:03,JojoGD,Mobile terraria sucks ever since the new update that added the moon lord
18-05-2020T22:57:17,KeefMcDerpface,Praise the moon?

18-05-2020T22:57:39,AspiringNoodle,"Play the clip ""11/10 hit reg"""
18-05-2020T22:57:39,JojoGD,The controls are garbage
18-05-2020T22:58:04,JojoGD,They were better before but you need another hand to play the game now
18-05-2020T22:58:39,JojoGD,They were confusing enough
18-05-2020T23:00:20,JojoGD,It was a fun game but the modifications of the controls ruined it :ptv-unimpressed:
