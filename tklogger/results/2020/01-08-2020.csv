01-08-2020T00:21:56,AspiringNoodle,"I feel like one day I'll stop playing DS3 just because there's so many dang options, lol"
01-08-2020T00:22:10,AspiringNoodle,"Like, the game has a massive catalogue of weapons to choose from, but then there are various infusions"
01-08-2020T00:22:22,AspiringNoodle,And then there's different types of spells / armors
01-08-2020T00:43:32,Dadrobit,Just finished up my Platinum for Ghost of Tsushima.
01-08-2020T00:43:40,Dadrobit,Goodness gracious.
01-08-2020T00:43:51,Dadrobit,Such an incredibly fantastic game
01-08-2020T00:48:36,AspiringNoodle,DS3 for me
01-08-2020T00:48:43,AspiringNoodle,I'm just trying to find weapons I like
01-08-2020T00:48:49,AspiringNoodle,"Not just in looks, but damage / performance xD"
01-08-2020T00:49:02,Dadrobit,I played that to exhaustion a few times already.
01-08-2020T00:49:05,AspiringNoodle,But I'd probably save myself a lot of heartbreak if I just moved on :P
01-08-2020T00:49:09,AspiringNoodle,PvP
01-08-2020T00:49:27,AspiringNoodle,Doesn't help that I downloaded a newer mod called Honest Merchant
01-08-2020T00:49:36,AspiringNoodle,Lets you purchase most of the items in the game for a single soul a piece
01-08-2020T00:51:02,AspiringNoodle,"So that, combined with a stat reallocation, and I'm using a 120 Dark / Chaos build, and just trying out different weapons"
01-08-2020T00:51:22,AspiringNoodle,Whips are looking like a no
01-08-2020T00:52:35,AspiringNoodle,I wonder if Elden Ring will be smaller in scope
01-08-2020T00:53:22,AspiringNoodle,What kind of build[s] did you play in dark souls?
01-08-2020T00:53:45,Dadrobit,Most everything once.
01-08-2020T00:57:56,AspiringNoodle,"I've done caster builds, they bore me"
01-08-2020T00:58:00,AspiringNoodle,"Too easy, lol"
01-08-2020T00:58:38,AspiringNoodle,"Also, ChaseTheBro found the most OP build in DS3"
01-08-2020T00:58:52,AspiringNoodle,It's a pyro build that uses the Demon's Scar and the Saint-Tree Bellvine
01-08-2020T00:59:39,AspiringNoodle,You get a fast-attacking curved sword and near instant pyro casts
01-08-2020T01:02:31,AspiringNoodle,"What was your favorite, btw?"
01-08-2020T01:02:44,Dadrobit,Luck build
01-08-2020T01:03:19,Dadrobit,That and going Dancer first boss just to flex
01-08-2020T01:05:33,AspiringNoodle,I can top that
01-08-2020T01:05:53,AspiringNoodle,"Beat both the Dancer and Pontiff on NG+1 with unupgraded weapons, lol"
01-08-2020T01:06:01,AspiringNoodle,Both... purely by accident :ptv-uneasy:
01-08-2020T01:06:33,AspiringNoodle,Don't think I'm a fan of whips
01-08-2020T01:06:46,AspiringNoodle,"Range is nice, and not being able to get parried is a huge plus"
01-08-2020T01:06:58,AspiringNoodle,But the wind-up on the attacks and the low damage make it hard to keep pressure
01-08-2020T01:08:17,Dadrobit,I'm off to play more No Man's Sky no.
01-08-2020T01:08:46,Dadrobit,Freaked out when I saw I had no saved data for a second.
01-08-2020T01:09:01,Dadrobit,Forgot I did a factory reset on my PlayStation
01-08-2020T01:09:08,AspiringNoodle,"Ugh, effing cowards in Dark Souls today..."
01-08-2020T01:09:17,Dadrobit,Still had everything backed up tho
01-08-2020T01:09:23,AspiringNoodle,QUILL is braver than them
01-08-2020T01:09:29,AspiringNoodle,And he's a complete noob
01-08-2020T01:09:57,AspiringNoodle,"Seriously, when playing with him he got invaded twice, and didn't freak out either time"
01-08-2020T01:26:03,AspiringNoodle,"Oof, that poor host.  Died to the PvE, didn't even do anything"

01-08-2020T01:52:10,AspiringNoodle,It's not fun being a room's distance apart yet their attacks still *magically* hit you

01-08-2020T02:26:25,TerraTheWizard,oop
01-08-2020T02:37:25,AspiringNoodle,Might have finally had my unfair advantage match
01-08-2020T02:37:38,AspiringNoodle,But the dude was so laggy that I wasn't being attacked and I was never sure if I hit him xD
01-08-2020T05:17:45,CrimsonQuill,ullo
01-08-2020T05:17:56,CrimsonQuill,Few minutes before work

01-08-2020T05:18:59,CrimsonQuill,Same here. Just been to Mass a few hours ago

01-08-2020T13:25:15,Ordithus,one of the mars missions has a helicopter!
01-08-2020T13:25:37,CrRAR,Helicopter... in space?
01-08-2020T13:26:21,Ordithus,"well, martian atmosphere"
01-08-2020T13:26:26,CrRAR,Did they do the science on that?
01-08-2020T13:26:54,CrRAR,I thought helicopter propultion becomes less efficient at higher altitudes because of thin air?
01-08-2020T13:27:29,CrRAR,Space would require mindboggling RPMs... or it could be like dividing by zero
01-08-2020T13:27:34,CrRAR,:boom:
01-08-2020T13:27:47,Ordithus,I've read it's equivalent to flying a helicopter at 29 km

01-08-2020T13:28:06,AspiringNoodle,Mars has something like 1/6th the atmospheric pressure

01-08-2020T13:49:19,AspiringNoodle,Coding can be neat

01-08-2020T13:53:06,JSWolf,But then I realized I could teach myself and that a liberal arts degree would be more useful for the type of thing I want to do
01-08-2020T13:53:24,JSWolf,So then I went to film school for a year before settling on my current major

01-08-2020T13:54:24,AspiringNoodle,"I hope that once the pandemic settles down, I can work for my 2nd job exclusively"
01-08-2020T13:54:30,AspiringNoodle,The gas station is grinding my gears...
01-08-2020T13:54:32,CrRAR,"Eh, just start accomplishing thngs in the direction you want"
01-08-2020T13:54:48,AspiringNoodle,Think trying to shift gears in a manual without engaging the clutch :ptv-laugh:
01-08-2020T13:55:26,JSWolf,I hope that I'm able to get a job once the pandemic settles down
01-08-2020T13:55:58,JSWolf,I really did pick the worst time to graduate lmao
01-08-2020T13:56:26,CrRAR,I got a job in 2012/3 in the midst the 2008 mess
01-08-2020T13:56:43,Ordithus,'10 was pretty challenging
01-08-2020T13:56:48,CrRAR,The world finds ways to keep turning~
01-08-2020T13:57:12,CrRAR,*engine sputtering noises*
01-08-2020T13:57:14,JSWolf,Fair enough
01-08-2020T13:57:35,JSWolf,I'm graduating with two degrees from a decent school and I have publications under my belt so eh
01-08-2020T13:57:35,Ordithus,and then I was laid off 3 times in 2 1/2 years
01-08-2020T13:57:40,AspiringNoodle,The app I'm working for got really screwed by this pandemic
01-08-2020T13:57:43,SpazztasticKiwi,people lost their jobs or quit
01-08-2020T13:57:46,SpazztasticKiwi,virtual stuff has become understood as essential despite not being so for life
01-08-2020T13:57:59,JSWolf,I hope it'll be alright
01-08-2020T13:58:07,Ordithus,good luck!
01-08-2020T13:58:17,AspiringNoodle,My boss (the owner) was hoping to start billing companies for using the app's services
01-08-2020T13:58:27,AspiringNoodle,But then the COVID nation attacked
01-08-2020T13:58:58,AspiringNoodle,"So that's been on pause during this whole thing, and he's trying to get more businesses on it with a free trial during this whole thing"
01-08-2020T13:59:17,AspiringNoodle,"Still, we lost 12 small businesses who had to close permanently"
01-08-2020T13:59:28,JSWolf,Ooof
01-08-2020T13:59:41,JSWolf,Sorry to both you and the businesses
01-08-2020T13:59:49,JSWolf,This pandemic thing really sucks huh
01-08-2020T13:59:54,AspiringNoodle,Mmhmm
01-08-2020T14:00:04,CrRAR,Yerp
01-08-2020T14:00:11,Ordithus,yaarp
01-08-2020T14:00:13,AspiringNoodle,I'm hoping that once this blows over he'll make enough money that I can be worked 15+ hours a week
01-08-2020T14:00:45,AspiringNoodle,"The station pays nice, but it's too much :ptv-laugh:"
01-08-2020T14:01:20,AspiringNoodle,"Also, dead-end job *shrug*"
01-08-2020T14:02:44,CrRAR,"Tbh, in the meantime a little freetime off never hurt anyone"
01-08-2020T14:02:55,CrRAR,"Sadly, travel is restricted tho"
01-08-2020T14:03:15,CrRAR,The best things are perspective-changing trips and travels
01-08-2020T14:03:19,AspiringNoodle,I *wish* I coulda collected unemployment during this whole thing
01-08-2020T14:03:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Im half sure I had an attendant hit on me
01-08-2020T14:03:29,Ordithus,finally gonna have some free time in a week
01-08-2020T14:03:30,AspiringNoodle,At a gas station?
01-08-2020T14:04:26,SpazztasticKiwi,where else is there an attendant
01-08-2020T14:05:03,JSWolf,I once had like a fifteen minute conversation with a cashier at a gas station
01-08-2020T14:05:05,AspiringNoodle,Let's see
01-08-2020T14:05:14,AspiringNoodle,Some giants have gas pumps :ptv-laugh:
01-08-2020T14:05:32,AspiringNoodle,"Also, forgive me, my brain is a bit loopy"
01-08-2020T14:05:32,SpazztasticKiwi,this guy kept me at least over an hour
01-08-2020T14:05:42,AspiringNoodle,Lack of sleep + trouble with the app
01-08-2020T14:05:53,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe 20-30 minutes before he got to pumping the gas
01-08-2020T14:06:25,JSWolf,She'd apparently heard me on the radio earlier that night and recognized my name/voice
01-08-2020T14:06:38,JSWolf,And I was like yoooooo
01-08-2020T14:06:41,CrRAR,"Wow, patience of a saint spazz"
01-08-2020T14:06:54,Ordithus,what why
01-08-2020T14:06:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I wasn’t bugged necessarily
01-08-2020T14:07:07,Ordithus,ah
01-08-2020T14:07:38,SpazztasticKiwi,randomly stuck in a conversation that would’ve been better in a building and not out in ~90 weather
01-08-2020T14:07:56,SpazztasticKiwi,tho I was in the car so I wasn’t dying
01-08-2020T14:08:50,SpazztasticKiwi,he went over that he’d noticed me around before at the mcdonalds across the street and coming to that station occasionally to get gas & that I worked at walmart down the road
01-08-2020T14:09:46,SpazztasticKiwi,he called me great for conversation and I was smart and pretty at least twice
01-08-2020T14:10:01,AspiringNoodle,Oh yeh
01-08-2020T14:10:04,AspiringNoodle,He flirtin'
01-08-2020T14:10:06,Ordithus,think he likes ya

01-08-2020T14:11:19,AspiringNoodle,"I have an innuendo version of RAR said, but is probably too NSFW-ish"
01-08-2020T14:11:43,SpazztasticKiwi,bad part was he was so “facinated” on me that there was a guy behind me for who knows how long waiting until he started getting out of his car
01-08-2020T14:11:56,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-ohmy:
01-08-2020T14:12:27,SpazztasticKiwi,first words out of his mouth when he walked up to help him “is that your girlfriend”

01-08-2020T14:12:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"buddy, I’m at least 10 if not 15 years younger ~looking~"
01-08-2020T14:13:19,SpazztasticKiwi,this ain’t a sugar baby
01-08-2020T14:14:44,SpazztasticKiwi,in his chatter he mentioned child support & a daughter
01-08-2020T14:15:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"& when he got at the end and was pulling up facebook so we could be friends, there was a girl"
01-08-2020T14:15:28,CrRAR,lovely
01-08-2020T14:15:41,SpazztasticKiwi,looking awful close to my age
01-08-2020T14:16:29,SpazztasticKiwi,but if she’s still on child support she’s closer to 16 and just tall
01-08-2020T14:17:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"other than that & he thinks covid is fake, he’s ok"
01-08-2020T14:17:42,CrRAR,‘ok’
01-08-2020T14:18:19,JSWolf,"reminds me of the time my dad said ""aside from the fact that he murdered somebody, ted kennedy was a good senator"""
01-08-2020T14:18:21,SpazztasticKiwi,him having a kids not as much a problem than the fact she could be in the same class as me
01-08-2020T14:19:43,SpazztasticKiwi,also gave me an invigorating take on the Bible
01-08-2020T14:19:52,CrRAR,I hope this place has good deals on gas
01-08-2020T14:20:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"I let him know my standing there when I responded, and to give him props, he didn’t try changing my mind"

01-08-2020T14:22:31,SpazztasticKiwi,my only problem aside from the possible “healthy” age gap is when he brought up his take on women as leaders and what it said in the Bible
01-08-2020T14:23:00,CrRAR,oh no
01-08-2020T14:23:13,JSWolf,I feel like you and I have very different standards Spazz

01-08-2020T14:23:57,SpazztasticKiwi,must’ve been something on my face cause he relented that “not that you couldn’t teach me anything” but women aren’t common pastors or leaders
01-08-2020T14:24:36,SpazztasticKiwi,what standards
01-08-2020T14:25:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to date someone who’s not going to think of me as a secretary or old enough to be my dad
01-08-2020T14:25:27,CrRAR,Sounds like a resonable request
01-08-2020T14:25:44,JSWolf,"I would not refer to a guy like that as ""okay except"" LMAO"

01-08-2020T14:28:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"like I told him, I don’t believe it’s fake because people are dying of something, even if it’s not something called covid, so there needs to be action just not panic"

01-08-2020T14:32:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"if it is the end times, there’s not stopping it because it’s gonna happen, much like the movies where that try stopping a cataclysm but end up helping it happen"
01-08-2020T14:32:02,AspiringNoodle,"Luckily for my sanity, I've dwindled down a huge portion of those either for aesthetic or moveset reasons :ptv-laugh:"

01-08-2020T14:33:08,AspiringNoodle,"That said, I settled on the Partizan because of its varied moveset"
01-08-2020T14:33:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"if you do feel panicked or uneasy about an end coming that you can’t stop, maybe you should look at yourself"
01-08-2020T14:33:27,CrimsonQuill,Partizan?
01-08-2020T14:33:28,AspiringNoodle,Most of the other spears (while some looked dope af) did one thing and one thing only.  THRUSTING ACTIIIOOOOOON!

01-08-2020T14:34:22,CrRAR,xD
01-08-2020T14:35:27,AspiringNoodle,"Generally speaking, I want weapons based on their moveset, or their pure damage output"
01-08-2020T14:36:05,AspiringNoodle,For example: The Washing Pole is one of the weaker katanas in the game
01-08-2020T14:36:18,AspiringNoodle,"But due to its stupidly long blade, it's actually one of the strongest katanas for PvP"
01-08-2020T14:36:30,CrimsonQuill,Reach is a very good advantage to have.
01-08-2020T14:36:46,CrRAR,Only challenged by the mighty Basitian katana
01-08-2020T14:37:00,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-keith8D:
01-08-2020T14:37:04,Ordithus,basitin katan is very reliable
01-08-2020T14:37:05,AspiringNoodle,"There are a lot of straight swords in the game too (btw, never use the Broadsword, that thing is pointless)"
01-08-2020T14:37:20,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-natsducky: one Natani and it's good to go
01-08-2020T14:37:38,AspiringNoodle,"But I ultimately settled on the Lothric Knight Sword due to its reach, damage, and overall aesthetics"

01-08-2020T23:31:04,SpazztasticKiwi,way
01-08-2020T23:31:06,AspiringNoodle,"My problem is that I like everything, lol"

01-08-2020T23:31:32,SpazztasticKiwi,multi is another thing
01-08-2020T23:31:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’d like a multi game but if it’s only, I don’t play with people"
01-08-2020T23:32:17,CrRAR,"Yeah, I like good single-players"
01-08-2020T23:32:25,CrRAR,There needs to be another good racer
01-08-2020T23:32:34,Ordithus,Games are sort of a thing I used to do
01-08-2020T23:32:44,Ordithus,Not too much anymore.
01-08-2020T23:32:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"never really have because I manly couldn’t but if I play what I like, there’s little chance someone else I know and has an account wants to join"
01-08-2020T23:32:45,CrRAR,Me too kinda lol
01-08-2020T23:33:00,SpazztasticKiwi,wanting
01-08-2020T23:33:20,SpazztasticKiwi,~if it’s only multi~
01-08-2020T23:33:52,SpazztasticKiwi,terraria is on my list as a maybe tho
01-08-2020T23:35:40,AspiringNoodle,My problem is that too many multiplayers these days are live service FOMO cash grabs
01-08-2020T23:35:47,AspiringNoodle,The battlepass systems needs to die...
01-08-2020T23:37:29,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-clovischuckle::moneybag:
01-08-2020T23:37:48,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-adiracoin:
01-08-2020T23:43:13,AspiringNoodle,Battle passes are a *deceptively* good value
01-08-2020T23:57:27,AspiringNoodle,"By that, I mean, ""Oh look at that, only $10 for all this content, AND I can earn enough currency for the next one for free??? Who WOULDN'T buy this?!"""
01-08-2020T23:58:32,SpazztasticKiwi,oh and I had to get gas today
01-08-2020T23:58:40,AspiringNoodle,But the gotcha is that you have to play 10's if not hundreds of hours during that season to unlock everything
01-08-2020T23:58:55,AspiringNoodle,"If you *don't* unlock everything, you'll never get it"
01-08-2020T23:59:02,Ordithus,maybe... don't worry about unlocking everything?
01-08-2020T23:59:08,AspiringNoodle,"And if you didn't get all the currency unlocks, you'll have to pay for the next one as well"
01-08-2020T23:59:08,SpazztasticKiwi,^
01-08-2020T23:59:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"don’t like it, don’t play it"
01-08-2020T23:59:31,Ordithus,let it go~
01-08-2020T23:59:35,AspiringNoodle,"I don't, that's the point"
01-08-2020T23:59:59,SpazztasticKiwi,complaining about it won’t fix the fact you gave them the first dollar
