24-01-2020T00:16:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I can barely do step 1....... this is gonna be a rough ride.   ;-;
24-01-2020T00:17:11,AspiringNoodle,Step 0: Get UBI passed

24-01-2020T00:18:14,AspiringNoodle,"Tbf, UBI will probably be implemented in some fashion in the near future"
24-01-2020T00:18:19,AspiringNoodle,"It's just a matter of ""when"""
24-01-2020T00:24:56,Werewing,"and ""who"". Who will pass it first? And who will resist it?"
24-01-2020T00:27:08,AspiringNoodle,The catalyst will be automation
24-01-2020T00:27:14,AspiringNoodle,The who will be the people losing their jobs
24-01-2020T00:28:16,Werewing,That's who gets it. I meant who will write the law.
24-01-2020T00:29:00,AspiringNoodle,Hopefully people like Andrew Yang :P
24-01-2020T00:29:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Yangs not gonna get the nomination
24-01-2020T00:29:47,Dadrobit,Here I am still donating tho.
24-01-2020T00:30:41,AspiringNoodle,UBI won't be some presidential thing
24-01-2020T00:30:50,Dadrobit,"Like, when presented with the Star Trek future, I'm not not gonna put in some effort to get that future."
24-01-2020T00:30:54,AspiringNoodle,It'll be bipartisan down the line
24-01-2020T00:31:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"He and Tulsi the better choices, but they are not gonna get the nomination"
24-01-2020T00:31:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,are*
24-01-2020T00:34:50,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, but to be fair, Yang never really planned on winning"
24-01-2020T00:34:57,AspiringNoodle,He just wanted to get the conversation around UBI started

24-01-2020T10:47:40,Nekonny,I need to come up with some arm poses for her....
24-01-2020T10:48:31,Pimsan,How about using isabelle's poses as base for our little mayor?
24-01-2020T10:50:44,Tharkis,"maybe arms crossed , hands flat, in a ""no way"" pose?"
24-01-2020T10:51:03,Tharkis,"the classic 'no way, stopr right there'"
24-01-2020T10:54:33,Nekonny,She already is too reminisent of Isabelle DX
24-01-2020T10:55:16,Pimsan,Good point.... This will be kinda hard to think for a pose.
24-01-2020T10:55:22,Nekonny,I can oonly have one pose where an arm overlaps a breast
24-01-2020T10:56:22,Pimsan,And how about with one hand on her hip?
24-01-2020T10:57:22,Tharkis,"one hand on hip, the other in a stern pointing forward? =P"
24-01-2020T10:59:59,Pimsan,"Anyway, i have to go. Going to my mother's place, see you guys later."
24-01-2020T11:00:27,swedishkitsune,laters pim
24-01-2020T11:00:40,Nekonny,cya pim
24-01-2020T11:01:02,Nekonny,the best poses are those that can be used interchangebly with others
24-01-2020T11:01:54,Nekonny,"look at all the combinations here, for example"
24-01-2020T11:02:14,Nekonny,"not all of them are great, but a lot of them work"
24-01-2020T11:02:48,Nekonny,my budget is 5 arms
24-01-2020T11:03:00,swedishkitsune,they better work or else they wont get food
24-01-2020T11:03:03,Nekonny,"so 2 left, 3 right"

24-01-2020T13:20:09,Nekonny,actually.. I think it's best to start with the base distortions first
24-01-2020T13:20:16,Nekonny,then finish with the custom objects
24-01-2020T13:20:31,Nekonny,this is going to tak  a while... and I need to \head off soon

24-01-2020T15:41:52,iliar,Hi Tom. May I ask a question about Sythe and Maren?
24-01-2020T15:41:58,iliar,I was sure that you have long been adding hints to the comic that there is something between them.
24-01-2020T15:42:07,iliar,"But today you said ""only brought up four pages ago"". Now I wonder if you actually left hints or is it just my imagination."
24-01-2020T15:42:32,CrRAR,Maren’s body language around Sythe def seems indicative.
24-01-2020T15:43:10,Twokinds,I meant the prospects of them having sex
24-01-2020T15:43:29,CrRAR,Eyyy

24-01-2020T15:45:41,CrRAR,Sounds like a perfect victory celebration.
24-01-2020T15:45:55,CrRAR,Mark your calendars folks.
24-01-2020T15:47:12,iliar,"In this case, this is not surprising. People love sex. I’m sure that even several artists are waiting for you to officially say “they had sex” to draw exactly how it was."
24-01-2020T15:48:33,iliar,And speaking of their relationship. Although I have long seen that there is something between them. I don’t understand what exactly attracts them to each other.
24-01-2020T15:48:44,CrRAR,Maren x Sythe do the do 2022?
24-01-2020T15:49:02,CrRAR,"(jk, maybe)"

24-01-2020T15:57:34,iliar,"In the case of Sythe, Okay, Maren’s boobs are a pretty heavy argument. But in the case of Maren... It doesn't look like she has Keidran fetish."
24-01-2020T15:57:42,iliar,"Therefore, such a simple answer like ""hi is hot"" is not works."
24-01-2020T15:57:49,iliar,Apparently something happened during the trip that brought them together. But I didn't see anything like it in the comic.
24-01-2020T15:58:12,CrRAR,haha
24-01-2020T15:58:30,IronHorseComics,I always thought the fact that they talked a lot was a good starting point

24-01-2020T15:58:59,IronHorseComics,and Keidran do approach the prospect of sex differently than humans do

24-01-2020T15:59:43,Twokinds,It's not a romantic relationship.

24-01-2020T16:11:57,iliar,"I don’t know how others, but one of the reasons why I love this comic, I like to watch how the personality of the characters changes. Natani is gradually taking her female half. Red learns to think before saying. And so on."

24-01-2020T17:07:01,IronHorseComics,I should probably learn how to do that
24-01-2020T17:07:14,MoonDance,even online classes. Some from Adobe's team themselves
24-01-2020T17:07:15,Zakuru,i dont like sub programs
24-01-2020T17:07:25,MoonDance,some are free

24-01-2020T17:07:29,Zakuru,i rather .. ya know.. own a program like sai
24-01-2020T17:07:36,Dedoutside,medibang allows you to have templates for comics and manga

24-01-2020T17:07:49,IronHorseComics,but not making the layers disappear

24-01-2020T17:07:59,IronHorseComics,I am but a newb at that
24-01-2020T17:08:14,Zakuru,i'll learn photoshop when i can afford it lol

24-01-2020T17:09:25,IronHorseComics,relatively...

24-01-2020T17:11:18,TeapotOfDoom,only annoying thing is that there's no H265 encoding option. and container size is limited. but i switched to DaVinci Resolve for editing anyway

24-01-2020T17:25:37,tehbear,never really gave FO:NV a chance. Wonder if its playable these days
24-01-2020T17:25:43,CrRAR,lol
24-01-2020T17:25:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,it is
24-01-2020T17:26:01,CrimsonHelsing,"I remember, when everyone entered the Sierra Madre casino, and it scattered them all throughout the place after knocking them out"
24-01-2020T17:26:04,CrRAR,Ages like a fine wine
24-01-2020T17:26:10,BadFoMo,It's playable on my Windows 7.
24-01-2020T17:26:15,tehbear,hah!
24-01-2020T17:26:16,CrimsonHelsing,same
24-01-2020T17:26:18,CrRAR,aww Sythe
24-01-2020T17:26:35,tehbear,Ages like Nuka Cola
24-01-2020T17:26:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,It has that old pc game charm while still being engaging
24-01-2020T17:27:34,CrimsonHelsing,"I can only hope the estate, or whatever is doing this, doesn't affect Trace and Flora's baby, if it's aware of that *shrug*"
24-01-2020T17:27:35,tehbear,"i really enjoy the FO series, so i think this is the year i will try it then ! :D"
24-01-2020T17:27:46,CrimsonHelsing,Fallout is awesome overall!
24-01-2020T17:27:48,BadFoMo,I know this thing can still play Kingpin and that's from 1999!
24-01-2020T17:28:05,PurpleLemons,:cpurplelemons-winkers:/ hiya
24-01-2020T17:28:06,tehbear,oh. i recall having that on a demo cd waay back
24-01-2020T17:28:09,BadFoMo,Yo.
24-01-2020T17:28:10,CrRAR,But can it do the Kessel run in 12 parsecs?
24-01-2020T17:28:15,TeapotOfDoom,hi purps
24-01-2020T17:28:25,CrimsonHelsing,"my first game was Fallout 4, worth every penny. then I worked my way back through NV and 3"
24-01-2020T17:28:46,CrimsonHelsing,"can't play the older games, those I hear have trouble even working on today's PCs"
24-01-2020T17:28:48,BadFoMo,My first Fallout was 3.
24-01-2020T17:28:56,CrRAR,That's the face of a man about to lose his bootycall xD
24-01-2020T17:29:01,tehbear,i started with FO2 back in 1999
24-01-2020T17:29:21,TheSexyBeast,"3, 4, and NV are all excellent"
24-01-2020T17:29:30,TeapotOfDoom,crrar xD
24-01-2020T17:29:33,CrimsonHelsing,"NV continues the story of 2, spiritually"
24-01-2020T17:29:37,CrRAR,"Maren: ""I heard you scream like a little girl when the table went crazy"""
24-01-2020T17:29:44,tehbear,"then i played FO1 which was easier, since you can steal everyone blind and get really good equip"
24-01-2020T17:29:50,CrRAR,"""You LOVE me don't you"""
24-01-2020T17:29:58,CrRAR,"""bleugh"""
24-01-2020T17:30:20,tehbear,"also. FO1 doesnt have the car, that sometimes leaves the trunk in 1 town, and the frunk in another"
24-01-2020T17:30:55,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,I prefer Fallout 3's Brotherhood over Fallout 4's Brohood
24-01-2020T17:31:04,CrRAR,lol
24-01-2020T17:31:15,CrimsonHelsing,"I prefer a mix of 3, NV, and 4"
24-01-2020T17:31:16,CrRAR,Your taste is exquisite
24-01-2020T17:31:22,CrimsonHelsing,in terms of the BoS
24-01-2020T17:31:38,tehbear,there was also FO tactics
24-01-2020T17:31:45,tehbear,but it was meh
24-01-2020T17:31:58,CrimsonHelsing,"3 certainly was more in line with the founder, Roger Maxon's ideals, according to the lore in 76"
24-01-2020T17:32:16,BadFoMo,Then there was Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel.
24-01-2020T17:32:17,CrRAR,Fallout 4 feels like what GTAV was to GTAIV.
24-01-2020T17:32:28,CrRAR,"More fleshed out, but not completely necessary."
24-01-2020T17:32:43,tehbear,GTAV was unplayable IMO
24-01-2020T17:32:47,CrRAR,^
24-01-2020T17:32:49,tehbear,eh. IV
24-01-2020T17:32:54,tehbear,or.. whatever 4 is in roman
24-01-2020T17:32:58,CrRAR,I like the story of IV
24-01-2020T17:33:04,TheSexyBeast,So a 2.0 reboot?
24-01-2020T17:33:11,CrimsonHelsing,"iirc V doesn't have as many minigames as IV, not even bowling"
24-01-2020T17:33:23,CrRAR,Yeah it felt lazier.
24-01-2020T17:33:30,BadFoMo,No Bowling?!
24-01-2020T17:33:50,DonotaroAfterDark,Hey Twokinds
24-01-2020T17:33:51,CrRAR,No BEEGGG AMERICAN tiddddies!?
24-01-2020T17:33:58,CrRAR,bah
24-01-2020T17:33:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
24-01-2020T17:34:02,CrimsonHelsing,"but then again in IV friends would nag you constantly in that game to hang out with them (NPC friends, not other players)"
24-01-2020T17:34:20,tehbear,"Cousin Nicooo! please hang out with me (oh god, please no)"
24-01-2020T17:34:27,CrRAR,yeah the bro system was a little annoying
24-01-2020T17:34:57,tehbear,and the car controls were so imprecise / lots of inertia
24-01-2020T17:35:09,tehbear,so weird going from Vice City to GTA4
24-01-2020T17:35:12,CrRAR,Those arcade physics
24-01-2020T17:35:14,CrimsonHelsing,Just Cause 2 PC much? >>
24-01-2020T17:35:24,CrRAR,"TBH tho, that type of stuff made GTA great."
24-01-2020T17:35:54,tehbear,"GTA was arcadey, but still difficult enough"
24-01-2020T17:35:58,tehbear,Just Cause is too easy
24-01-2020T17:36:08,CrimsonHelsing,and shallow
24-01-2020T17:36:15,CrRAR,Can't have fun is ya can't have police cars careening the distance of a football field
24-01-2020T17:36:18,tehbear,everything looks impressive with lots of bullets and explosions
24-01-2020T17:36:21,CrimsonHelsing,can't even go into buildings outside of quests
24-01-2020T17:36:26,TheSexyBeast,GTA:VC is my favorite of the series
24-01-2020T17:36:41,tehbear,"but isnt impressive, since if you pulled out all the stops, how can you top it?"
24-01-2020T17:36:48,CrimsonHelsing,can't interact with the world other than shooting and blowing sh*t up
24-01-2020T17:37:13,tehbear,the soundtrack of GTA:VC :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
24-01-2020T17:37:34,TheSexyBeast,YAASSSS

24-01-2020T17:38:11,CrimsonHelsing,"JC3, I hear it's the same as JC2, just as limited world interaction"
24-01-2020T17:38:20,tehbear,and more explosions
24-01-2020T17:38:52,tehbear,its fun for 5 minutes never to be played again kinda game
24-01-2020T17:38:57,CrimsonHelsing,"nothing but dicking around with guns, vehicles, grapples, and explosions, and that's it"

24-01-2020T17:45:02,TheSexyBeast,There's always an element of horror with magic
24-01-2020T17:45:11,CrimsonHelsing,especially dark magic

24-01-2020T18:23:54,TeapotOfDoom,oh i see you're a man of culture as well
24-01-2020T18:24:24,ThingsAreMoving,Mathematicians have their own culture?
24-01-2020T18:24:26,tehbear,judging by the ominous signs its very likely everyone in the mansion might be heading for l'hospital
24-01-2020T18:24:31,CrRAR,"oh no, it's all dark."
24-01-2020T18:25:01,MuonNeutrino,"the simplest way i've ever seen to explain why division by zero is weird is to note that the answer to 'a divided by b' is 'the number which, when multiplied by b, equals a'"
24-01-2020T18:25:18,MuonNeutrino,"if b is zero, then you're looking for 'the number which, when multiplied by zero, equals a'"
24-01-2020T18:25:24,MuonNeutrino,"which, if a isn't also zero, is no such number"
24-01-2020T18:25:28,ThingsAreMoving,"There's more red than dark, which by most accounts means lots of murderous intent or lots of hot lovin'"
24-01-2020T18:25:37,MuonNeutrino,"and if a IS zero, then it's EVERY number"
24-01-2020T18:25:43,CrRAR,good analysis
24-01-2020T18:25:43,MuonNeutrino,"either way, the answer isn't well defined"
24-01-2020T18:25:55,MuonNeutrino,"thhere are tricks like l'hospital, but that's why the operation doesn't make sense"
24-01-2020T18:26:03,CrRAR,hot... murderous lovin?
24-01-2020T18:26:12,Rolley,Yes^
24-01-2020T18:26:20,MuonNeutrino,"it's also why saying the answer is infinity isn't really right either, because infinity times zero is *really* weird"
24-01-2020T18:26:25,ThingsAreMoving,As long as most of them survive I'd watch that
24-01-2020T18:26:27,MuonNeutrino,also infinity isn't actually a number

24-01-2020T19:13:19,tehbear,we dont know. there was a flash of red light
24-01-2020T19:13:26,MuonNeutrino,hard to tell exactly what happened
24-01-2020T19:14:22,thestooge2222,In the sketch it looked like she was being transported like how raine did it

24-01-2020T19:28:40,ThingsAreMoving,"Yeah, like I said, it's not even near perfection but it's pretty decent"
24-01-2020T19:29:14,ThingsAreMoving,"If I had more time, tools, works pace and access to materials It would be much better"
24-01-2020T19:31:14,ThingsAreMoving,"like grinding veal and beef on my own, adding some finely minced chicken liver to the ragu, using san marzano tomatoes, not the cheapest store stuff, making proper ricotta/mozarella cheese mix for layering, not messing up the final layer"
24-01-2020T19:31:18,ThingsAreMoving,etc ^^
24-01-2020T19:31:25,ThingsAreMoving,work space*
24-01-2020T19:32:38,MuonNeutrino,"is it possible to blend up the tomatoes some, or is that too heresy for the dish?"
24-01-2020T19:32:55,MuonNeutrino,i personally don't care for chunky tomato bits in sauce
24-01-2020T19:33:21,ThingsAreMoving,"up to whoever is cooking. I like chunks, but if one doesn't like them using tomato puree and some passata is 100% fine"
24-01-2020T19:33:49,MuonNeutrino,it looks like a tasty recipe for sure tho
24-01-2020T19:34:32,ThingsAreMoving,Here's some more: https://imgur.com/a/T9zcbSS%20https://imgur.com/a/cpurnIg%20https://imgur.com/a/bLbKaLD%20https://imgur.com/a/PftXVcy

24-01-2020T19:35:10,ThingsAreMoving,picarto why do you convert space onto %20 automatically
24-01-2020T19:35:32,ThingsAreMoving,"welp, you can separate them on your own if you wish."
24-01-2020T19:35:41,MuonNeutrino,yeah i got them
24-01-2020T19:36:00,TeapotOfDoom,me2

24-01-2020T19:38:00,MuonNeutrino,those look very tasty indeed
24-01-2020T19:38:38,ThingsAreMoving,"Not even sure where they originated from, but in Poland they're almost always present on the table during various important occasions"
24-01-2020T19:38:42,TeapotOfDoom,ima casually save those recipes for later use...
24-01-2020T19:38:43,ThingsAreMoving,They're just too tasty
24-01-2020T19:38:56,TeapotOfDoom,indeed
24-01-2020T19:39:24,MuonNeutrino,"that a traditional filling for them, or are there varieties, or what?"
24-01-2020T19:39:59,ThingsAreMoving,I think that filling is traditional.
24-01-2020T19:40:41,TeapotOfDoom,seems to be. identical to the one we would use
24-01-2020T19:40:42,ThingsAreMoving,"You can use mushrooms with cheese or other stuff but I never did, so no idea if it's tasty or not"
24-01-2020T19:41:10,ThingsAreMoving,"onion, smoked bacon, sour pickle, mustard, salt and pepper"
24-01-2020T19:41:21,ThingsAreMoving,simple but incredible

24-01-2020T21:21:24,xcvb,around 990 when Trace glanced at Saria
24-01-2020T21:21:30,Mediawatcher,But I’m genuinely intrigued
