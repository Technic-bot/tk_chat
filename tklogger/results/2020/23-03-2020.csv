23-03-2020T01:49:29,AspiringNoodle,I love how when what's supposed to be in a whisper accidentally drops into text
23-03-2020T01:49:55,AspiringNoodle,And of course it's the worst part that makes ZERO sense and can be taken WAY out of context without the rest of the chat xD
23-03-2020T01:50:13,SonOfGoku,Yeah
23-03-2020T01:50:28,AspiringNoodle,"Omg, I wish I could remember who I was chatting with when they did that"

23-03-2020T11:51:50,AspiringNoodle,GameStop FINALLY closed all locations
23-03-2020T11:52:27,AspiringNoodle,"Only took consumer outrage, employee protests, and, oh yeah, THE EFFING GOVERNMENT for them to realize, ""Hey, maybe we're not an essential service and shouldn't be open during a worldwide pandemic"""

23-03-2020T11:53:06,AspiringNoodle,Not even joking.  It took the effing government telling them to shut down for them to actually do it

23-03-2020T11:55:49,AspiringNoodle,"Maybe reggie can be a miracle worker again for GameStop, but at the same time it seems like their entire corporate hierarchy might be incompetent..."
23-03-2020T12:05:46,CrRAR,"Ehhh, games, though may remain physical as an option will increasingly become digital."
23-03-2020T12:05:56,BlackjacksSec99,I think they were trying to run out the clock and put themselves into bankruptcy faster
23-03-2020T12:06:18,BlackjacksSec99,"yeah, I havent bought a physical game in 3 years"

23-03-2020T12:08:14,BlackjacksSec99,with how fast download speeds are on average theres almost no point to physical copies anymore

23-03-2020T14:28:08,BlackjacksSec99,ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
23-03-2020T14:29:09,AspiringNoodle,SCP has two meanings

23-03-2020T14:31:58,AspiringNoodle,"Shy guys is classified as a Euclid, which more or less means the object isn't completely understood, and it's not reliably contained"
23-03-2020T14:32:45,BlackjacksSec99,"and is all just creepypasta fiction, right?"
23-03-2020T14:32:48,AspiringNoodle,yes
23-03-2020T14:33:46,AspiringNoodle,"I'm gonna read Incident 096-1-A, whereby a Doctor purposefully causes a containment breach of the Shy Guy to demonstrate to the O5-council that Shy Guy should be reclassified as Keter, as it is a potential XK-class End-of-the-World scenario"
23-03-2020T14:34:38,AspiringNoodle,"Shy Guy is a very pale humanoid with stretched proportions, appearing emaciated, notable for being very tall, skinny, and having elongated limbs / digits"
23-03-2020T14:35:08,AspiringNoodle,"While a physical entity, it represents a cognitohazard, meaning that the danger lies in knowing about it."

23-03-2020T14:36:43,BlackjacksSec99,"speaking of creepypastas,,,,,   The Russian sleep experiment"

23-03-2020T14:37:22,BlackjacksSec99,"so, just thinking about the face?"
23-03-2020T14:37:35,AspiringNoodle,"Once the Shy Guy is active, it will start heading straight for whoever has ""seen"" its face"

23-03-2020T14:38:28,JojoF2415,Why did the teacher made me read an article about tik tok
23-03-2020T14:38:31,CrRAR,Oh okay maybe it's the same xD
23-03-2020T14:38:54,AspiringNoodle,What makes it dangerous is the subconscious factor
23-03-2020T14:39:01,CrRAR,Because it's hip and trendy and socially toxic!
23-03-2020T14:39:10,CrRAR,jojo
23-03-2020T14:39:32,AspiringNoodle,SCP 096 was once activated when a man noticed a strange cluster of FOUR pixels on a photograph from a mountain climbing trip
23-03-2020T14:39:44,CrRAR,Yeah xD
23-03-2020T14:39:47,AspiringNoodle,That was enough to activate the Shy Guy
23-03-2020T14:40:10,AspiringNoodle,"And once Shy Guy is active, it's impossible to contain.  There is no measure you can take to physically restrain the thing"

23-03-2020T14:42:03,BlackjacksSec99,lol
23-03-2020T14:42:07,AspiringNoodle,Seriously though.  Can't believe it took THAT to make the most paranoid foundation in the world realize that this thing could end the world if its face ever leaked to the public

23-03-2020T17:54:14,BlackjacksSec99,allo
23-03-2020T17:54:33,BlackjacksSec99,back from my venture. it did not go well...
23-03-2020T17:55:12,BlackjacksSec99,"surprisingly found eggs and bread. but, my plan for the DMV did not work :("
23-03-2020T17:55:48,BlackjacksSec99,have to wait 4 to 6 weeks to get my registration for my motorcycle
23-03-2020T18:01:48,AspiringNoodle,I need to work up the nerve to call the COBRA line and see what the dentist needs to hand in for a claim :ptv-uneasy:
23-03-2020T18:01:53,AspiringNoodle,But I shall do that tomorrow
23-03-2020T18:06:56,BlackjacksSec99,*waves* Hi Tom
23-03-2020T18:07:38,BlackjacksSec99,how goes life?
23-03-2020T18:07:43,AspiringNoodle,"Hmmm, I want to know if spicy food exists in the world of Mekkan, lol"
23-03-2020T18:08:01,AspiringNoodle,Probably need to read the whole comic again >:3
23-03-2020T18:08:12,AspiringNoodle,...And scour through all the sketches ._.
23-03-2020T18:08:30,SpazztasticKiwi,why a motorcycle
23-03-2020T18:08:53,SpazztasticKiwi,didn’t you mention kids - how do you pile them on a cycle
23-03-2020T18:09:36,AspiringNoodle,"Reverse pyramid style, duh"
23-03-2020T18:10:17,BlackjacksSec99,"because I bought it new in 2014, and I dont Always have the kids. 50/50% split in time with their mom. on the days I dont have them, it saves a crazy amount of gas (80mpg+) and is much relaxing."
23-03-2020T18:10:58,BlackjacksSec99,I wanted the 50/50 btw. she wanted to take them from me for all but 2 days a month >.<
23-03-2020T18:12:18,SpazztasticKiwi,hurling 70+ down a very hard surface with little but your adrenaline between you and a future as road pizza
23-03-2020T18:12:20,SpazztasticKiwi,fun
23-03-2020T18:12:39,BlackjacksSec99,EXACTLY! :D
23-03-2020T18:12:39,SpazztasticKiwi,and if it rains - a 70 mph bath
23-03-2020T18:12:48,BlackjacksSec99,"lol been there, dont that too"
23-03-2020T18:13:41,AspiringNoodle,Glad you were able to get 50/50
23-03-2020T18:13:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I had an ex whose grandpa had a cycle
23-03-2020T18:14:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"he’s had to give it up cause it’s getting harder to walk but last I’ve heard, he’s still refusing to sell it"
23-03-2020T18:15:02,BlackjacksSec99,"so... the whole deal with it is yeah, theres nothing to stop you from becoming a grease smear, but, theres nothing around you. complete freedom. that little joy you get from putting your hand out the window in the airstream?"
23-03-2020T18:15:08,BlackjacksSec99,multiply that by 1000
23-03-2020T18:15:08,SpazztasticKiwi,CinnamonToastKen sold his close to immediately after he found his wife was pregnant
23-03-2020T18:17:17,BlackjacksSec99,"spaz, yeah, Im kinda lucky,  I live out in the country so its comparitivly much safer of a riding environment"
23-03-2020T18:20:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve yet to get a chance to ride one even with a friend but me and what amounts to a motorized bike
23-03-2020T18:21:02,SpazztasticKiwi,may not be a friendly situation
23-03-2020T18:22:09,tehbear,Ed March on youtube is fun if you want to see what motorcycling can be like
23-03-2020T18:22:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I chipped a bone in my ankle sliding across carpet & managed to crack my arms growth plate down the middle slipping off a log
23-03-2020T18:22:24,BlackjacksSec99,ouch!!!
23-03-2020T18:22:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I got talent - it’s just not desirable
23-03-2020T18:22:56,BlackjacksSec99,?
23-03-2020T18:23:02,tehbear,a talent for breaking bones?
23-03-2020T18:23:13,AspiringNoodle,"""I am the world's BEST at breaking bones! :D"""
23-03-2020T18:23:30,AspiringNoodle,"""...unfortunately, they just happen to be my own... :ptv-uneasy:"""
23-03-2020T18:23:49,SpazztasticKiwi,the only reason those things happened is both falls had me landing on what broke with all my weight
23-03-2020T18:24:20,SpazztasticKiwi,try twisting an ankle and landing on it while it’s at 90 degrees
23-03-2020T18:24:22,BlackjacksSec99,well thats no good
23-03-2020T18:25:18,tehbear,limbs. try to keep the rotation within means.
23-03-2020T18:26:36,tehbear,twisting a limb is one thing. but combining it with a force is recipe for pain or worse.
23-03-2020T18:26:43,SpazztasticKiwi,double jointed ankles can allow for that kind of movement but it’s not meant to do so rapidly and hold all your weight on top of it
23-03-2020T18:26:56,tehbear,are you double jointed Kiwi?
23-03-2020T18:27:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"thanks to my dad, yea"
23-03-2020T18:29:36,tehbear,"seems there is two kinds of double jointedness: one where the ligament between bones is looser than normal, the other were your bones are actually shaped differently."
23-03-2020T18:29:49,BlackjacksSec99,"lucky, i am most decidedly not flexible...."
23-03-2020T18:32:19,SonOfGoku,"I'm lucky that I have yet to get seriously hurt, the closest was when I screwed up one of my fingers but missed the bone"
23-03-2020T18:32:50,SpazztasticKiwi,neither am I considering breaking my arm means it doesn’t bend up fully anymore
23-03-2020T18:33:15,BlackjacksSec99,i cant fully extend my right arm. fractured radial head in my elbow
23-03-2020T18:33:41,SpazztasticKiwi,yep - cracked right down my growth plate there
23-03-2020T18:36:01,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s odd being right handed from left handed parents and not being able to use your right hand because it’s essentially defective
23-03-2020T18:36:30,tehbear,i thought it was the arm?
23-03-2020T18:36:38,tehbear,your hand is broken too?
23-03-2020T18:36:49,SpazztasticKiwi,hand is connected to the arm
23-03-2020T18:37:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"being in a cast meant my arm lost strength and because of where the bone broke, I lost flexibility"
23-03-2020T18:37:22,tehbear,so your right arm and hand do nothing?
23-03-2020T18:37:41,SpazztasticKiwi,they’re still usable
23-03-2020T18:37:42,tehbear,or can you still write with it?
23-03-2020T18:38:16,SpazztasticKiwi,but I favor heavy objects on my left side
23-03-2020T18:39:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I also use my left hand for more now yet it’s still useless for writing and drawing
23-03-2020T18:40:02,tehbear,"started playing Half-Life Alyx today. You hold guns with your right, and generally lift stuff up with your left. But barrels and heavy objects require 2 hands."
23-03-2020T18:40:31,tehbear,what about scissors?
23-03-2020T18:40:44,SpazztasticKiwi,still right handed
23-03-2020T18:40:48,tehbear,"as a leftie, they are my only problem"
23-03-2020T18:40:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I broke my arm in like 6th grade
23-03-2020T18:41:34,tehbear,"thats almost a late grade to break your arm, most kids break their limbs before that :P"
23-03-2020T18:42:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I never got the chance to break anything even by accident younger than 12
23-03-2020T18:42:17,SpazztasticKiwi,my dad kept me inside when I was young unless I was at home
23-03-2020T18:43:54,tehbear,?
23-03-2020T18:44:05,tehbear,inside when not at home?
23-03-2020T18:44:22,tehbear,"but outside when home, then :P"
23-03-2020T18:46:53,SpazztasticKiwi,monitored
23-03-2020T18:47:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"and as for the ankle thing, that happened even further back"
23-03-2020T18:48:22,SpazztasticKiwi,good news is push-ups and pull ups are effectively impossible for me because the mobility of my arm is theoretically restricted
23-03-2020T18:52:10,tehbear,just have to one arm it from the get go
23-03-2020T18:52:26,tehbear,"eventually, just use will power like in hot shots 2... iirc"
23-03-2020T18:53:13,tehbear,"you have hypermobility, but its restricted... :("
23-03-2020T18:55:10,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
23-03-2020T18:55:17,tehbear,":ctwokinds-kingtea: if youre a king, could you say its hyper nobility?"
23-03-2020T18:55:37,tehbear,gnight Terra
23-03-2020T18:56:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"other than the arm being a little weaker than the other, there’s not been any difference"
23-03-2020T18:58:11,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s no physical marks - not like the bone came out of the skin or anything - and I’ve yet to have to come across a time where the bending limits comes into play
23-03-2020T18:59:21,SpazztasticKiwi,the new limitations for food service might make them shut down the hot case at work
23-03-2020T19:00:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"if we can’t serve food where people can sit and eat it, and despise no tables people will snack on what they get there before paying for it"
23-03-2020T19:01:19,AspiringNoodle,I can see that being a problem
23-03-2020T19:01:21,SpazztasticKiwi,they may close it down or we’ll have to put sealer stickers on everything
23-03-2020T19:01:36,AspiringNoodle,Isn't this whole situation grand?
23-03-2020T19:01:51,SpazztasticKiwi,which I’m not opposed to the sticker idea
23-03-2020T19:02:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve had customers stand there at the case and smack on food like they were raised by vultures
23-03-2020T19:02:43,tehbear,people are the worst
23-03-2020T19:03:41,tehbear,i thought you worked at the fresh foods counter? cutting up meats and weighing and packing?
23-03-2020T19:04:38,tehbear,but you also sell sammiches and what not?
23-03-2020T19:05:49,SpazztasticKiwi,the sandwiches salads pinwheels wraps and other banes of my existence are made in store from kits but they’re put out in the refrigerated area off to the side
23-03-2020T19:06:07,tehbear,:ctwokinds-power:
23-03-2020T19:07:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"we sell cold salads with the hot case stuff like boneless bbq, general tso, and orange and bone in ranch, buffalo and plain fried chicken"
23-03-2020T19:07:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"along with mac & cheese, mashed potatoes and gravy, corn, jalapeño poppers, salmon, catfish"
23-03-2020T19:08:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"potato wedges, and tenders"
23-03-2020T19:08:58,SpazztasticKiwi,along with the rotisserie chickens and 8 piece chicken on the bottom next to the popcorn chicken & shrimp
23-03-2020T19:09:14,AspiringNoodle,"Spazz, I imagine most customers are neutral - good in terms of interactions"
23-03-2020T19:09:23,AspiringNoodle,But the ones who go to the bad end of the scale decide to go full tilt
23-03-2020T19:09:55,SpazztasticKiwi,it varies from uneventful to I’ve killed you four times in my mind now
23-03-2020T19:10:37,tehbear,that long list of food reminds me of the shrimp types in Forest Gump again
23-03-2020T19:11:20,tehbear,"boil it, broil it, bake it, saute it."
23-03-2020T19:11:43,tehbear,I bet you can identify the types of customers now
23-03-2020T19:12:19,tehbear,"guess there are some regulars too, which should make it easier?"
23-03-2020T19:12:44,CrRAR,:fried_shrimp:
23-03-2020T19:13:18,tehbear,CrRAR shrimp. Zip it. Rar it. Tar it.
23-03-2020T19:14:17,CrRAR,Jar it.
23-03-2020T19:14:40,tehbear,"which is basically just zip, but what java likes to call it"
23-03-2020T19:14:47,CrRAR,Yeah xD
23-03-2020T19:15:45,tehbear,labmeat is progressing
23-03-2020T19:18:56,SpazztasticKiwi,one that I’m most immediate to dislike is the “smile sweetheart” men
23-03-2020T19:22:53,tehbear,"they say ""smile sweetheart"" or the equivalent?"
23-03-2020T19:23:18,tehbear,or they just act entitled ?
23-03-2020T19:24:28,SpazztasticKiwi,ive had variations of it - some just insist I should smile “for them”
23-03-2020T19:24:52,tehbear,sounds like Mad Men
23-03-2020T19:25:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"which, a hint for interacting with women, that’s a great way to ensure she will not"
23-03-2020T19:26:17,tehbear,any other characters?
23-03-2020T19:26:49,SpazztasticKiwi,but then there’s the ones that just *KNOW EVERYTHING* and how it’s done and try insist you do something or change something for them
23-03-2020T19:28:14,SpazztasticKiwi,contrary to the saying the customer is not always right
23-03-2020T19:28:20,SpazztasticKiwi,or even accurate
23-03-2020T19:28:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"most often, the customer is numb from the neck up"
23-03-2020T19:29:06,tehbear,ever ask them to come behind the counter and just do it themselves? sounds easier than trying to explain how someone is to do their job
23-03-2020T19:29:41,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s very much a “go clock in if you know so damn much” situation
23-03-2020T19:30:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom popped out again
23-03-2020T19:30:40,tehbear,how do you know?
23-03-2020T19:31:36,tehbear,is he your neighbour?
23-03-2020T19:32:05,tehbear,also. I think some people just like to 1 up everyone in topics they think they know
23-03-2020T19:33:22,tehbear,"... i was lurking in chat some days ago, and what you said about the lady who ordered Ham, and wanted Turkey was comedy gold"
23-03-2020T19:48:59,SpazztasticKiwi,...the userlist
23-03-2020T19:51:35,tehbear,"ah, of course."
23-03-2020T19:54:27,tehbear,"i dont remember how you put it, but I envision soneone asking for a slice how ham, watching the shopkeeper bring it out, slice it, and first then, exclaim they wanted a slice of turkey"
23-03-2020T19:54:51,tehbear,and then changing their mind a 2nd time
23-03-2020T19:55:30,AspiringNoodle,"Retail needs to stop enabling stupid people, lol"

23-03-2020T23:20:22,JojoF2415,The sketch looks like crap tho. I messed up so many time
23-03-2020T23:20:24,BlackjacksSec99,"lol noodle, just impressed"
23-03-2020T23:21:04,AspiringNoodle,Impressed with what man?  SPIT IT OUT!

23-03-2020T23:21:53,AspiringNoodle,Am I missing links to somewhere?
23-03-2020T23:22:10,BlackjacksSec99,lol your WoW achievement
23-03-2020T23:23:32,AspiringNoodle,You play WoW?
23-03-2020T23:23:43,BlackjacksSec99,"rarely, but yeah"
23-03-2020T23:23:59,AspiringNoodle,"For Orgrimmar, I used only a single sanity orb"
23-03-2020T23:24:11,AspiringNoodle,Even had my failsafe available :snail:
23-03-2020T23:25:06,AspiringNoodle,Have you done the visions yet?
23-03-2020T23:25:44,BlackjacksSec99,"nope, Im not even on the latest version... I havent upgraded since... erm..."
23-03-2020T23:25:57,BlackjacksSec99,the one after mists of pandaria?
23-03-2020T23:26:44,JojoF2415,Also I’m a mobile gd player.
23-03-2020T23:26:46,AspiringNoodle,WoD
23-03-2020T23:27:05,AspiringNoodle,"That expansion was a shitshow, but it looks like a GD masterpiece compared to BFA, lol"
23-03-2020T23:27:50,BlackjacksSec99,"no, legion... that was the one I upgraded on"
23-03-2020T23:27:56,BlackjacksSec99,had to look it up lol
23-03-2020T23:28:52,AspiringNoodle,"Ah, nice solid choice"
23-03-2020T23:29:01,AspiringNoodle,Shame that artifacts are deactivated.  They were awesome
23-03-2020T23:29:15,AspiringNoodle,Blizzard gotta stop locking stuff up after an expansion ends :/
23-03-2020T23:29:18,BlackjacksSec99,the archaology thing?
23-03-2020T23:30:19,AspiringNoodle,"No, the artifact weapons"
23-03-2020T23:30:43,AspiringNoodle,"As well as certain appearance options.  Last I checked, certain artifact appearances were locked away once the expansion ended"
23-03-2020T23:31:16,BlackjacksSec99,"ohhh, yeah, thats no so good"
23-03-2020T23:32:01,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, I think WoW will die in the next few expansions, unless Blizzard gets its act together"
23-03-2020T23:32:24,AspiringNoodle,"They've recently gone down the path of reinventing huge chunks of the game every expansion, or expanding upon the worst / most hated parts of the previous expansion"
23-03-2020T23:32:38,BlackjacksSec99,maybe thats why they came out with classic?
23-03-2020T23:32:50,AspiringNoodle,"They *say* they've learned their lesson, that they've gone too far with pruning.  But I'll believe it when I see it"
23-03-2020T23:33:13,AspiringNoodle,"Blizzard has a habit of saying, ""We here you, you aren't happy, we screwed up.  We'll make this right.""  Then going the exact opposite direction."
23-03-2020T23:33:22,AspiringNoodle,And I think Classic was more of a business move
23-03-2020T23:33:37,AspiringNoodle,"Even in Legion, Classic private servers were up and running, and they were super popular"
23-03-2020T23:34:11,BlackjacksSec99,hummm dunno. have to wait and see I guess.
23-03-2020T23:34:19,AspiringNoodle,"Blizzard more or less commercialized part of their IP that was in huge demand for a long time, but they weren't supplying"
23-03-2020T23:34:53,BlackjacksSec99,the only thing ide wish they did was to get a LITTLE more serious with graphics. still cartoony compared to their trailers.
23-03-2020T23:34:59,AspiringNoodle,"Personally, I'd probably have more fun with Classic"
23-03-2020T23:35:17,AspiringNoodle,"But retail has so many QoL features, that you need ALL the addons to try and replicate"
23-03-2020T23:35:58,AspiringNoodle,"Like, I played Classic before hopping back into retail for 8.2.  The game was super chill, and I was having fun socializing and taking my time."
23-03-2020T23:36:27,AspiringNoodle,"But a sub is a sub is a sub.  If I'm subbed, I feel pressured to play, even if it's arguably the most cost effective form of entertainment."
23-03-2020T23:36:43,BlackjacksSec99,this is true
23-03-2020T23:37:01,AspiringNoodle,$78 or so if you sign up for 6 months
23-03-2020T23:37:08,AspiringNoodle,$13 a month
23-03-2020T23:37:30,AspiringNoodle,That is so little money compared to other forms of gaming!
23-03-2020T23:37:54,BlackjacksSec99,Ive got $400 ish into DCS World

23-03-2020T23:42:41,JojoF2415,I’m struggling so bad on the ship but I got past it once on normal mode with no start position
23-03-2020T23:43:17,AspiringNoodle,Anyone else in agreement that WoW should just redo the Warcraft movie?  But do it themselves?
23-03-2020T23:43:21,AspiringNoodle,Just make it all 3d animation
23-03-2020T23:43:31,AspiringNoodle,"Do the script themselves, add in some classic Blizzard humor."
23-03-2020T23:44:36,AspiringNoodle,"Movie looked great, pacing was fine, was a smidge of uncanny valley, but some parts of the plot felt weird without knowing the game's backstory"
23-03-2020T23:45:08,AspiringNoodle,"Gul'dan was more or less ""old scary orc is scary because robes, spikes, skulls, and life-draining magic."""
23-03-2020T23:45:26,SpazztasticKiwi,the only think that prank videos tech me is men should never trust their friends
23-03-2020T23:45:40,AspiringNoodle,Why is he doing what he is?  Why does he have this power?  WHY did he assemble all the orc clans and create this giant portal to invade another world?
23-03-2020T23:49:18,BlackjacksSec99,"spaz, accurate 100%"
23-03-2020T23:49:48,BlackjacksSec99,"noodle, yeah, the movie was disappointing..."
23-03-2020T23:49:56,AspiringNoodle,I still saw it twice ;)
23-03-2020T23:50:00,AspiringNoodle,I fan b0i'd HARD
23-03-2020T23:50:15,JojoF2415,That’s the 2nd time someone trolls me with a alcoholic drink
23-03-2020T23:53:14,BlackjacksSec99,?
23-03-2020T23:58:27,CrRAR,lol spazz it's the old survival of the fittest's modern reincarnation.
23-03-2020T23:58:56,BlackjacksSec99,so.... anyone want to theory out why Amelia Riftwall looks... wolf-ish considering the latest panels?
23-03-2020T23:59:14,CrRAR,She is kinda more lion-y
