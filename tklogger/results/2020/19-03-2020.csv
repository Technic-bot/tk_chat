19-03-2020T01:08:48,AspiringNoodle,...Wow... I think my feelings for WoW boiled over yesterday
19-03-2020T01:09:06,AspiringNoodle,I just logged in to do one of the few things I said I'd do until my sub runs out
19-03-2020T01:09:21,AspiringNoodle,"And I basically just found myself saying ""f*ck everything"" for half a minute ._."
19-03-2020T01:11:56,AspiringNoodle,Like... wow...

19-03-2020T02:09:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn’t see countdown as horror watching it
19-03-2020T02:10:15,SpazztasticKiwi,but it’s not trashy

19-03-2020T10:51:28,JojoF2415,☕️
19-03-2020T10:52:15,AspiringNoodle,I heard some interesting things yesterday c:
19-03-2020T10:55:02,JojoF2415,What things
19-03-2020T10:56:50,AspiringNoodle,"Gas stations in my state might reduce to gas sales only, voluntarily or otherwise"
19-03-2020T10:57:09,AspiringNoodle,And supposedly grocery stores are hiring at twice the normal wage.  They need stockers.
19-03-2020T10:57:59,AspiringNoodle,"Meanwhile, I'm just pumped because I was only scheduled for 2 days this work week, so I work today and tomorrow, then off 5 days :D"
19-03-2020T11:05:03,JojoF2415,I hate when I get those anime based game ad.
19-03-2020T11:21:45,TerraTheWizard,so i reread the whole comic yesterday for the first time in around 4 years
19-03-2020T11:22:03,TerraTheWizard,didn't realise i'd forgotten so many details
19-03-2020T11:22:22,TerraTheWizard,but maaaan
19-03-2020T11:22:26,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
19-03-2020T11:23:09,AspiringNoodle,Earlier comic was mostly situational with little bits here and there really exploring character backstory
19-03-2020T11:23:19,AspiringNoodle,At some point Tom went full storyteller
19-03-2020T11:23:57,AspiringNoodle,At least from what I remember
19-03-2020T11:25:02,AspiringNoodle,That said... it did a pretty decent job of setting up the world
19-03-2020T11:31:08,AspiringNoodle,...I miss Laura ;c
19-03-2020T11:31:09,AspiringNoodle,:c*

19-03-2020T11:33:04,DZAladan,I can see 'em anywhere online. Gimme a good plot.
19-03-2020T11:57:52,AspiringNoodle,I read Twokinds for the *plot* :ptv-snicker:
19-03-2020T12:39:17,JojoF2415,I tried Phobos in practice mode
19-03-2020T12:39:46,JojoF2415,1078 attempts with 27:56 minutes
19-03-2020T12:41:23,JojoF2415,Tartarus was a nightmare to beat in practice mode
19-03-2020T12:41:46,JojoF2415,42 minutes with 1821 attempts

19-03-2020T20:15:54,Ordithus,idunno

19-03-2020T20:17:35,Twokinds,ugh
19-03-2020T20:17:40,SageSaga,you ok?
19-03-2020T20:17:43,Ordithus,Hi Tom!
19-03-2020T20:17:51,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Hi Tom
19-03-2020T20:17:54,Sclimshady,Howdy Tom
19-03-2020T20:17:56,Twokinds,I've got a headache because I forgot to drink coffee this morning.
19-03-2020T20:18:15,InTheLionsDen,:ctwokinds-kingtea:
19-03-2020T20:18:22,Ordithus,"Not enough coffee to remember you needed coffee, been there.  Ick"
19-03-2020T20:18:26,HoverdudeXL,oh. understandable
19-03-2020T20:18:28,Twokinds,"I did MAKE the coffee, but left it in the pot and got caught up with work. Forgot."
19-03-2020T20:18:42,HoverdudeXL,oh.
19-03-2020T20:18:49,HoverdudeXL,happens to al of us tom
19-03-2020T20:18:55,Ordithus,Sounds like you have (cold) coffee
19-03-2020T20:19:21,Sclimshady,Perfect opportunity for iced coffee
19-03-2020T20:20:21,Zakuru,Headache because... no caffeine? :ptv-wondering:
19-03-2020T20:21:05,RimaDraws,aw tom i did that with my tea
19-03-2020T20:21:07,Twokinds,Yeah I always get a headache after a few hours if I go off my routine.
19-03-2020T20:21:21,HoverdudeXL,oh.
19-03-2020T20:21:41,HoverdudeXL,coffee is necesary
19-03-2020T20:21:55,Zakuru,well routine makes more sense than... no coffee
19-03-2020T20:21:59,Zakuru,that sounds unhealthy if that was the case
19-03-2020T20:22:23,JeremySenpai,injects Tom with caffeine
19-03-2020T20:22:32,Sclimshady,Caffeine will legitimately cause withdrawals
19-03-2020T20:22:40,SageSaga,i get a headache whenever i take my new medicine- but that's because it causes all the blood vessels in my body to expand even the ones in my brain so i get this slower throwing pulsing pain running through my brain- literally
19-03-2020T20:22:41,Zakuru,Sadly
19-03-2020T20:22:41,Twokinds,I do drink a lot of coffee. I should probably cut back.
19-03-2020T20:22:48,Sclimshady,Its really common with heavy users
19-03-2020T20:22:54,HoverdudeXL,probalby
19-03-2020T20:22:59,Zakuru,Do you have a certain taste? Or is it any coffee you can drink?
19-03-2020T20:23:04,aeoronwah,yoooooo
19-03-2020T20:23:08,Ordithus,"yikes, Sage!  That sounds so unpleasant :ctwokinds-zenshocked:"
19-03-2020T20:23:09,RimaDraws,i had alot of withdrawal
19-03-2020T20:23:12,SageSaga,yo Aeoronwah
19-03-2020T20:23:31,SageSaga,yeah it is very unpleasant but so is the intense pain i feel otherwise
19-03-2020T20:23:49,Zakuru,I don't get headaches when I'm lacking in sugar so I guess I'm still in the clear :ptv-laugh:
19-03-2020T20:24:46,RimaDraws,hope you feel better tom
19-03-2020T20:25:49,HoverdudeXL,does this mean no stream today?
