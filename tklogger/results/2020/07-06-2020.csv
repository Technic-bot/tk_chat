07-06-2020T00:03:05,SpazztasticKiwi,guy was giving $500 or something for child support
07-06-2020T00:03:18,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
07-06-2020T00:03:24,SpazztasticKiwi,took him to court to try & get more
07-06-2020T00:03:49,SpazztasticKiwi,judge ruled he should be giving $250
07-06-2020T00:03:58,SpazztasticKiwi,so now that‚Äôs all he gives her
07-06-2020T00:04:22,Demianartist,vaya
07-06-2020T00:05:49,AspiringNoodle,Oof
07-06-2020T00:05:57,AspiringNoodle,"Let me guess, she had a decent job or something at that point?"
07-06-2020T00:07:19,SpazztasticKiwi,no clue
07-06-2020T00:07:32,SpazztasticKiwi,who knows if it‚Äôs even true or not either
07-06-2020T00:08:22,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs a possibility but there‚Äôs always stories to be had on the internet
07-06-2020T00:08:57,AspiringNoodle,Stories like this aren't that uncommon.  The family court system historically screws men
07-06-2020T00:09:25,AspiringNoodle,"I would need to find it, but iirc, there was a case where a guy was paying a ludicrous amount of money to his ex-wife per month"
07-06-2020T00:09:49,AspiringNoodle,But eventually got the payments cancelled because she was at a new job making a six figure salary
07-06-2020T00:10:19,SpazztasticKiwi,as fascinating as a tirade would be I‚Äôll pass
07-06-2020T00:11:29,SpazztasticKiwi,anyone have the new galaxy
07-06-2020T00:11:53,BlackjackSec99,I was paying $642 a month for my kids when I had them 50% of the time. My ex took me to court to get more money and more custody of them. walked out with 50-50 and I dont have to pay her a dime.
07-06-2020T00:12:39,AspiringNoodle,Naisu
07-06-2020T00:12:46,BlackjackSec99,I have the note 10 + Spazz
07-06-2020T00:13:05,AspiringNoodle,I need to watch the LTT video.  Apparently there are some pretty big problems with the S20
07-06-2020T00:13:20,AspiringNoodle,"Enough for LTT to give a big fat ""DO NOT BUY"" recommendation"
07-06-2020T00:13:29,BlackjackSec99,like the S7 battery problems?
07-06-2020T00:13:48,AspiringNoodle,No idea
07-06-2020T00:14:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I was wondering cause what‚Äôs the thing on the back of the phone
07-06-2020T00:14:09,SpazztasticKiwi,besides the camera
07-06-2020T00:14:28,AspiringNoodle,"WHen it comes to engineered products like laptops and smart phones, there are 2 kinds of mistakes"
07-06-2020T00:14:39,BlackjackSec99,"on the note 10 theres 2 cameras, a range finder, a flashlight and something else"
07-06-2020T00:14:41,AspiringNoodle,"1) ""Are you effing stupid or something?"""
07-06-2020T00:14:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"looking at this ‚Äúupgrade program‚Äù from at&t, it‚Äôs showing the new galaxy and the thing looks like an alien phone"
07-06-2020T00:15:00,AspiringNoodle,2) Unforeseen problems / oversights that should be handled gracefully
07-06-2020T00:15:11,BlackjackSec99,alien phone
07-06-2020T00:15:12,BlackjackSec99,?
07-06-2020T00:15:21,AspiringNoodle,"Apple tends to do both, lol, but fails the 2nd one miserably"
07-06-2020T00:15:30,SpazztasticKiwi,wrong phone to be showing me to upgrade to because I have the iphone upgrade plan but
07-06-2020T00:15:36,SpazztasticKiwi,that‚Äôs what it showed me
07-06-2020T00:15:39,AspiringNoodle,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K37gF3xqAs0
07-06-2020T00:15:49,SpazztasticKiwi,and the range finder does what
07-06-2020T00:15:49,AspiringNoodle,Please don't buy a Galaxy S20 Ultra.
07-06-2020T00:15:59,AspiringNoodle,Gonna watch this right now
07-06-2020T00:16:55,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs that little cube at the corner on the back that I was looking at
07-06-2020T00:17:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"it‚Äôs the flashlight, camera, camera, camera as something else from what I can tell"
07-06-2020T00:17:51,SpazztasticKiwi,why does it have 4 cameras
07-06-2020T00:18:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm used to the iphone round camera spots on phone backs
07-06-2020T00:18:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"but yea, trouble in paradise must be fun"
07-06-2020T00:19:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I got a cousin whose husband has I believe just one other kid with another lady - daughter
07-06-2020T00:19:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"she never had anything to do with him, never wanted or really let him if she could prevent it see her"
07-06-2020T00:20:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"all because he‚Äôd gotten married to my cousin and moved on, starting a family with my said cousin"
07-06-2020T00:20:50,AspiringNoodle,I would love to know of any stories out there where the opposite is true
07-06-2020T00:21:02,AspiringNoodle,"But I find that when it comes to divorce proceedings, time with the kids, payments, etc"
07-06-2020T00:21:12,AspiringNoodle,The wife tends to be the greedy / spiteful one
07-06-2020T00:21:35,AspiringNoodle,More often than not because the court is positioned to automatically support the lady
07-06-2020T00:21:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"and now just a small while back, she went to court to try getting child support from him - court ruled that her current boyfriend/husband counted as a guardian and legally, the kid had two legal parents & didn‚Äôt need his child support"
07-06-2020T00:21:54,AspiringNoodle,OH SNAP
07-06-2020T00:22:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"from what I know, she‚Äôs still trying"
07-06-2020T00:22:19,AspiringNoodle,"And in turn, confirming my perceived stereotype yet again"
07-06-2020T00:22:21,SpazztasticKiwi,there are stories that have the opposite
07-06-2020T00:22:30,AspiringNoodle,Links plz :D
07-06-2020T00:22:34,SpazztasticKiwi,why
07-06-2020T00:22:39,SpazztasticKiwi,so you can ignore them
07-06-2020T00:22:53,AspiringNoodle,Because I want to read them and not live in a world where it's only the women screwing the men in family court
07-06-2020T00:23:07,AspiringNoodle,Would LOVE to know about the other side
07-06-2020T00:23:17,SpazztasticKiwi,because I have a feeling you will based on ‚Äúconfirming my perceived stereotype‚Äù
07-06-2020T00:23:38,AspiringNoodle,"Wait, you said stories about the men screwing the women in family court, yeh?"
07-06-2020T00:23:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm sure you could find some yourself if you did a google search
07-06-2020T00:23:49,SpazztasticKiwi,not at all
07-06-2020T00:23:56,AspiringNoodle,Awww
07-06-2020T00:24:24,SpazztasticKiwi,reread chat if you want to see what I said because none of that was a part of my messages
07-06-2020T00:24:35,SpazztasticKiwi,it may be what you understood but I didn‚Äôt say it
07-06-2020T00:24:47,SpazztasticKiwi,it goes both ways is the problem
07-06-2020T00:25:05,SpazztasticKiwi,you can hear more from one half than the other based on where you live
07-06-2020T00:25:46,AspiringNoodle,It's nice to know that the courts can work like they're intended to :ptv-hearts:
07-06-2020T00:26:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"while my cousin is an example of one, she lives away from me, where you can hear of the opposite happening"
07-06-2020T00:26:15,AspiringNoodle,"Men screwing over the women, yeh?"
07-06-2020T00:26:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd say being irresponsible
07-06-2020T00:26:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"but in a sense, screwing them over too"
07-06-2020T00:27:22,SpazztasticKiwi,good handful of they‚Äôre all about being with her until that night the condom broke
07-06-2020T00:27:29,SpazztasticKiwi,suddenly he didn‚Äôt know her
07-06-2020T00:27:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"wanted a relationship, not a kid so he packs up and üí®"
07-06-2020T00:28:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"though I will say, no that‚Äôs not court failure"
07-06-2020T00:29:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"either way, the kid ain‚Äôt the problem - if you can only stand the person until one happens, you weren‚Äôt a good match"
07-06-2020T00:30:26,AspiringNoodle,"Reading this article, it's just, oof"
07-06-2020T00:30:36,SpazztasticKiwi,adding a kid can make someone a different person
07-06-2020T00:31:46,AspiringNoodle,Indeed
07-06-2020T00:32:03,AspiringNoodle,My one coworker had to deal with someone like that
07-06-2020T00:32:18,AspiringNoodle,She was in a relationship with a dude who turned out to be a total dickbag
07-06-2020T00:32:34,AspiringNoodle,"convinced her to make some poor choices, was in the military, ended up having a kid with her"
07-06-2020T00:32:44,AspiringNoodle,But dude went AWOL and just ghosted
07-06-2020T00:32:55,SpazztasticKiwi,see
07-06-2020T00:33:05,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs not just the wome
07-06-2020T00:33:10,AspiringNoodle,"At least she gets the last laugh, they caught his ass :upside_down:"
07-06-2020T00:33:46,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs just never good to generalize
07-06-2020T00:34:14,SpazztasticKiwi,especially custody and split couples and kids and child support
07-06-2020T00:35:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve seen more men skip out than petty women but I still know it‚Äôs there just as bad
07-06-2020T00:37:46,SpazztasticKiwi,important to always listen to the whole situation story by story - people have tried to sway my opinions in the past before I started deciding for myself
07-06-2020T00:39:57,SpazztasticKiwi,& yeah I mean I sent a hi on messenger awhile back - may be a request too but it doesn‚Äôt show anymore to me so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
07-06-2020T00:40:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôm on here alot but since my discord crashed to a halt, I don‚Äôt use it for friends as much as fb anymore"
07-06-2020T00:40:53,SpazztasticKiwi,and memes - discord is for my memes
07-06-2020T00:42:01,BlackjackSec99,"wait, did you send ME a message on fb?"
07-06-2020T00:44:55,SpazztasticKiwi,....did you not see me say that earlier
07-06-2020T00:45:05,BlackjackSec99,i didnt... lol
07-06-2020T00:45:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"oh yeah back on the phone, all the things on the back are the cameras & flashlight"
07-06-2020T00:45:33,Demianartist,i really dosent know what you mean guys
07-06-2020T00:45:57,SpazztasticKiwi,the weird looking thing was the telephoto camera
07-06-2020T00:46:09,BlackjackSec99,"send me a message again on fb if you can, cause I think i got one from someone who I had no clue who it was and thought it might have been spam"
07-06-2020T00:46:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I said who I was
07-06-2020T00:46:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Kiwi
07-06-2020T00:46:50,SpazztasticKiwi,but what‚Äôs a telephoto camera
07-06-2020T00:47:00,SpazztasticKiwi,or rather I might google that
07-06-2020T00:47:07,BlackjackSec99,telephoto is fancy for zoom
07-06-2020T00:47:47,BlackjackSec99,"instead of digitally zooming, it uses lenses and whatnot to optically zoom in. you get a better resolution that way"
07-06-2020T00:48:12,BlackjackSec99,you sent the message to a M.Z. ?
07-06-2020T00:49:46,Demianartist,bueno bueno bueno
07-06-2020T00:50:51,BlackjackSec99,whats good?
07-06-2020T00:52:04,Demianartist,que ya termine un dise√±o m√°s de Hanki.
07-06-2020T00:52:43,BlackjackSec99,"ok, I know what Que and mas is"
07-06-2020T00:52:51,BlackjackSec99,but im lost on the rest
07-06-2020T00:53:04,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúso what‚Äôs this do‚Äù
07-06-2020T00:53:14,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúfancy zoomies‚Äù
07-06-2020T00:53:31,Demianartist,o Claudio mean i finished a other design of my character Hanki.
07-06-2020T00:54:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"while one or two of us can read Spanish, most here cannot"
07-06-2020T00:54:15,SpazztasticKiwi,best to stick to English
07-06-2020T00:54:37,Demianartist,what you mean?
07-06-2020T00:54:37,BlackjackSec99,"I know a few terms that are common to hardware store ""I broke this and need to fix it"" but thats about it...."
07-06-2020T00:55:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I can understand conversation enough to know what‚Äôs being said
07-06-2020T00:55:24,Demianartist,oh okey
07-06-2020T00:55:33,SpazztasticKiwi,favorite day was a Spanish family came up to the food counter and was talking to each other
07-06-2020T00:56:01,SpazztasticKiwi,was fine - I was scooping out what they‚Äôd ordered not paying attention until one of them said I was pretty to the other
07-06-2020T00:56:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"that, I caught"
07-06-2020T00:56:34,BlackjackSec99,"lol my mom has a similar story, but a little more rare."
07-06-2020T00:56:51,Demianartist,i am Peruvian
07-06-2020T00:57:39,BlackjackSec99,"Two ladies were talking in line in front of her in finnish. conversation lasted for like 5 or 6 minutes and then mom interjected, in finnish, and they suddenly looked horrified. like ""what have we been talking about?!?!?"""
07-06-2020T00:59:58,Demianartist,jajajaja
07-06-2020T01:03:15,AspiringNoodle,"Well, I think Ima go to bed an hour early tonight"
07-06-2020T01:03:36,AspiringNoodle,"Good day so far.  Watched strem, cut into my youtube backlog a bit, finally unsubbed from a channel"

07-06-2020T01:06:42,AspiringNoodle,"Also, I grow closer to shaving my head, we'll see if I finally snap on that front!"

07-06-2020T01:25:24,SpazztasticKiwi,my hairs technically at my shoulder blades without the culrs
