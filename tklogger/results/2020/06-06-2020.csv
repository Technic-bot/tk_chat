06-06-2020T00:27:08,AspiringNoodle,"Fun fact about squirrels, they're paranoid little nut hoarders"
06-06-2020T00:27:19,AspiringNoodle,But they're so stupid that they forget where they hide most of their nuts :ptv-laugh:
06-06-2020T00:41:29,AspiringNoodle,Forgot to mention: These little dum-dums are still pretty useful
06-06-2020T00:41:40,AspiringNoodle,The nuts they forget about are likely to become new trees!
06-06-2020T00:45:41,SpazztasticKiwi,so that’s where you came from

06-06-2020T11:48:10,Zakuru,hi terra :3
06-06-2020T12:15:40,RimaDraws,i wont be here today because i have to sleep for night shift
06-06-2020T12:20:40,AspiringNoodle,"Just woke up and now that I'm less pissed off, considering finally typing up 3-weeks notice :)"
06-06-2020T12:21:25,RimaDraws,oh?
06-06-2020T12:21:36,AspiringNoodle,"But first, a shower"
06-06-2020T12:22:28,RimaDraws,yay showers are good
06-06-2020T12:32:36,AspiringNoodle,Back
06-06-2020T12:32:48,AspiringNoodle,So this was the first week that the station is closing at midnight now
06-06-2020T12:33:21,AspiringNoodle,"And I call bullsheet because the new closing hours were announced less than a week in advance, and 2nd shift was effectively told to suck it up"
06-06-2020T12:34:00,AspiringNoodle,My one coworker who is way more aggressive on such matters talked with the manager because she was given no notice of a change in her hours
06-06-2020T12:34:13,AspiringNoodle,She had to call the store to find out that she'd be in here until past midnight to close up shop
06-06-2020T12:34:45,AspiringNoodle,Several problems with this whole arrangement.
06-06-2020T12:35:10,AspiringNoodle,"1) She lives an hour away, so the soonest she'd get home is probably 1:30"
06-06-2020T12:35:52,AspiringNoodle,"2) She has a small child at home.  And while she is currently living with her mother, her mother is more or less getting ready for work at the same time she's coming home, so there's a potential for her small child to be home alone at 2 in the morning"
06-06-2020T12:37:13,AspiringNoodle,"3) When we were closing the store at 10, one person from second would be running the store solo for an hour, with half an hour to close up.  That is now 3 hours solo followed by half-hour close"
06-06-2020T12:37:59,AspiringNoodle,"4)  The hour change is because the store wants to go back to 24/7, but we have no people willing or able to work overnight.  So these hours will be going on until whenever we can fill the overnight position."
06-06-2020T12:38:17,AspiringNoodle,#WallOfText
06-06-2020T12:41:35,AspiringNoodle,I apologize for all the eyes I have destroyed today ._.

06-06-2020T13:50:58,AspiringNoodle,Would it be Mirage's porkchops?
06-06-2020T13:51:24,AspiringNoodle,...DANGIT.  Now I'm remember the porkchops I talked about just to screw with my teammates a week ago xD
06-06-2020T13:59:54,RimaDraws,no its keto mac n cheese

06-06-2020T14:19:49,InTheLionsDen,In theory about 40 minutes from now but that would depend on if Tom has woken up yet.

06-06-2020T17:09:33,Stormagedon,the voice that i see tom using whenever he chats is the voice of a disapointed father
06-06-2020T17:09:42,ProsePro7,Tom is just saying that because he plans to kill off Natani at the end of the story
06-06-2020T17:09:43,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Most likely Nora or Reni might help to allow it to happen.  From what Tom said in the past, the dragons are on par with the Masks in terms of power."

06-06-2020T21:58:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve turned primarily vegetarian for awhile to lose some weight myself
06-06-2020T21:58:59,SpazztasticKiwi,sounds like that’d be quite the add in for a salad
06-06-2020T21:59:39,SpazztasticKiwi,home scale says 140
06-06-2020T21:59:56,SpazztasticKiwi,at the drs it goes about 150 or more
06-06-2020T22:00:01,SpazztasticKiwi,somebody’s lying
06-06-2020T22:00:03,BlackjackSec99,"Bleeding a bit actually... the machine im using is kinda powerful and if i werent wearing safety glasses, ide have lost an eye today. big scratch left in them from rocks... arms hurt too, and my hand is bloody."
06-06-2020T22:00:15,Ordithus,damn

06-06-2020T22:01:06,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s some that you can get that are cut resistant
06-06-2020T22:01:26,SpazztasticKiwi,at least you have numbers close to each other
06-06-2020T22:01:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m getting a ten pound difference
06-06-2020T22:02:07,BlackjackSec99,"oh, thats with pants, thermals (cold) work boots, long sleeves, a sweater and gloves. My weedeater is kinda... overkill lol"
06-06-2020T22:02:35,BlackjackSec99,"ehh, not suprising. home scales arent really accurate for a real number, just seeing if you are going up or down."
06-06-2020T22:02:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I know what’ll help
06-06-2020T22:02:44,SpazztasticKiwi,a nice long hot bath

06-06-2020T22:03:30,BlackjackSec99,:-p
06-06-2020T22:03:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t imagine full body stinging when parts of you look close to hamburger meat is fun
06-06-2020T22:04:00,BlackjackSec99,"ehh, I dont really feel it when I get cut anymore?"
06-06-2020T22:04:16,BlackjackSec99,"I mean, yeah, stings a little, but it doesnt bother me"
06-06-2020T22:04:20,SpazztasticKiwi,well that’s encouraging
06-06-2020T22:05:40,BlackjackSec99,"im... going through some issues right now... Im not self harming, but when I do get minor cuts and scrapes its like it just doesnt bother me in the slightest..."
06-06-2020T22:06:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve had a whole tack in my foot for a few hours before I got the hint something was up
