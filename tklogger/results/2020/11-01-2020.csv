11-01-2020T16:17:33,ProsePro7,I will say that I am super jealous of the recent page and wish it was me not him in that situation

11-01-2020T16:20:06,ProsePro7,Didnt suggest it this time but I'm thinking of Natani and Zen as Mandalorians for one of my next suggestions

11-01-2020T17:04:25,Twokinds,I already said Dragons shapeshift innately. They're MADE of magic. It doesn't matter what form they're in. They take forms that can't use magic literally ALL the time.
11-01-2020T17:04:27,iliar,Why not both? Western Bastian Nora vs Eastern  Bastian Nora.
11-01-2020T17:05:00,AspiringNoodle,Hmmm

11-01-2020T18:30:54,tehbear,i was thinking if she used up her last reserve and is now stuck basitin until recharged
11-01-2020T18:31:16,CrimsonQuill,She might have realised that she now needs to wear ankle wraps.

11-01-2020T18:59:13,Dimensional,I guess it's Tom's pick for both?

11-01-2020T18:59:44,ProsePro7,Tom is gonna be a giant tease for the foreseeable future
11-01-2020T18:59:47,FLOriceRyzi,Someone should’ve probably stuck with Natani in lingerie in general
11-01-2020T18:59:47,BigotedSJW,"Dangit, realized the commissary is now closed. And I need to shop for cleaning and wrapping supplies. So much for hanging around, and lovely sketch of ""Make Me"", Two. Might poke back in later."

11-01-2020T19:00:17,KeefMcDerpface,Bye.
11-01-2020T19:00:22,ProsePro7,o/
11-01-2020T19:00:27,MviluUatusun,He finds himself attracted to a tiger-striped red fox vixen and he fights with his upbringing to accept the relationship.
11-01-2020T19:01:06,FloofyCat,Huh... what usually happens if someone suggests something that's upcoming in the comic? Do they usually just get messaged to put another suggestion in?
11-01-2020T19:01:15,Channelfiction,"I still find the concept of this suggestion weird, he and Natani have seen each other naked so many times this might be considered conservative."
11-01-2020T19:01:30,Twokinds,Usually I filter it
11-01-2020T19:01:33,Ordithus,Lingerie is lewder than nude

11-01-2020T19:01:54,OldeWolfe,Nudity is over-rated.
11-01-2020T19:02:07,ThingsAreMoving,That's why nuns are so hot :ctwokinds-smug:

11-01-2020T19:02:24,ShamusTheFox,"It's the message it sends, really. Naked is natural and beautiful, but can also be accidental. You wear lingerie, and it's a different message. ""I want you to look at me."""
11-01-2020T19:02:26,ProsePro7,Whats the fun of a present if there is no wrapping to take off
11-01-2020T19:02:33,Almighty404,"If it's a sexy nun, why not ?"
11-01-2020T19:03:30,MviluUatusun,"Oh, BTW, my story has absolutely no porn.  (I don't write that kind of stuff.)"
11-01-2020T19:03:33,Ordithus,"take it a bit further, Natani would be hot in a hoodie"
11-01-2020T19:03:40,FloofyCat,The two suggestions I won was in the past and Mike x Kat Christmas one so I guess I never risked something that could happen in the comic pfft
11-01-2020T19:03:46,Ordithus,cuz Nat <3
11-01-2020T19:03:51,RimaDraws,<3

11-01-2020T19:04:51,Ordithus,"none, just that Natani always looks good"
11-01-2020T19:04:54,KeefMcDerpface,Assassin Creed Nat?
11-01-2020T19:06:22,Almighty404,Kills you with good looks ?
11-01-2020T19:06:41,ThingsAreMoving,"Floofy, my very first suggestion was Mary's and Raine's first arrival in Lyn'Knoll. It was called spoiler central by Tom, and after that I never suggested anything that could come close to spoilers xD"

11-01-2020T19:08:26,Almighty404,I'm sure they made lots of spoilers back then when they made cars.
11-01-2020T19:08:43,ThingsAreMoving,Muscle cars didn't have spoilers
11-01-2020T19:08:46,ThingsAreMoving,...I think

11-01-2020T19:58:30,ShamusTheFox,I am actually thirsty. Time for a soda.
11-01-2020T19:59:06,ShamusTheFox,"Also, I wanna live in Snowdin. Just warmer."
11-01-2020T19:59:09,ThingsAreMoving,"I'm hooked up on 'Surfer on acid'. Send thoughts and prayers, this drink is too tasty."
11-01-2020T19:59:14,unsteddyphoenix,Honestly. Im into it
11-01-2020T19:59:19,CrRAR,“Why not?”

11-01-2020T19:59:34,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,I love this Pic
11-01-2020T19:59:40,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,and this music
11-01-2020T19:59:42,falangie123,whats the premise of this sketch??
11-01-2020T19:59:53,ThingsAreMoving,deep dark fantasies
11-01-2020T20:00:14,CrRAR,hehe
11-01-2020T20:00:28,unsteddyphoenix,youngtani is great
11-01-2020T20:00:30,unsteddyphoenix,thats the premise
11-01-2020T20:00:32,NezumiYuki,I find it ironic how Youngtani wants older self to flaunt her tits when initially she was bummed to learn how racked she’d grow up to.  XD
11-01-2020T20:01:16,falangie123,but youngtani is happy with being female right?
11-01-2020T20:01:26,Katfeathers,Mayhap this helps explain the binder fail
11-01-2020T20:01:28,falangie123,or is it more complicated
11-01-2020T20:01:30,ThingsAreMoving,"yeah, she just said it's a pain"
11-01-2020T20:01:30,NezumiYuki,Yea I’d think
11-01-2020T20:01:31,Ordithus,got 'em rock 'em
11-01-2020T20:01:37,CrRAR,^
11-01-2020T20:01:37,ShamusTheFox,I think it's kinda cool to have an ACTUAL inner dialogue with yourself.
11-01-2020T20:02:00,ThingsAreMoving,You don't talk with yourself?
11-01-2020T20:02:22,ShamusTheFox,I do. But I know how I'll answer.
11-01-2020T20:02:24,unsteddyphoenix,ITS JUST THAT EASY
11-01-2020T20:02:31,NezumiYuki,^ talking to yourself is a good thing
11-01-2020T20:02:40,falangie123,yeh just ask gollum
11-01-2020T20:02:48,NezumiYuki,What?  Don’t liok at me strange!!
11-01-2020T20:02:49,CrRAR,Natani basically: “Come up with a MORE REALISTIC fantasy!”
11-01-2020T20:02:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I believe this has something to do with the “be forward and you’ll make his brain short out”
11-01-2020T20:02:54,NezumiYuki,Look*
11-01-2020T20:03:00,unsteddyphoenix,Its when you start roasting yourself thats the problem

11-01-2020T20:03:15,ThingsAreMoving,"I'm a quiet man, so I mainly just think to myself. And sometimes I surprise myself with the kind of answers i get when I allow my thoughts to wander about."
11-01-2020T20:03:45,falangie123,you should write them down
11-01-2020T20:03:55,ThingsAreMoving,Nein. They're mine.
11-01-2020T20:04:03,SageSaga,hmm im trying to find out if i can keep my PC cooler with some fans in the top of it-
11-01-2020T20:04:05,falangie123,who said you had to share what you wrote?
11-01-2020T20:04:09,ShamusTheFox,I always kinda annoy myself when I read a story and all the characters' voices sound exactly like mine.
11-01-2020T20:04:34,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,You want your fans to stand on your computer???
11-01-2020T20:04:35,Ordithus,"As long as they move more air, yes, Sage"

11-01-2020T20:32:30,RimaDraws,i am wanting to learn to run again. i am out of shape
11-01-2020T20:32:43,ThingsAreMoving,I bought one of them water rowing machines. It's awesome

11-01-2020T20:33:11,johnnytho,Yeah running has a steep starting curve. Once you can run 5k without stopping it gets fun/easier
11-01-2020T20:33:12,ThingsAreMoving,"I love to swim, too"
11-01-2020T20:33:33,ProsePro7,Listening to books is a good way to multi task while working out

11-01-2020T20:33:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I havn't swam in forever.  Used to do it religiously.

11-01-2020T20:36:16,ThingsAreMoving,I want to build up some lung capacity and endurance through rowing and then maybe pick up jogging or running
11-01-2020T20:36:36,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,which poll are you picking from?
11-01-2020T20:36:42,MuonNeutrino,there are various exercise plans where you alternate walking and jogging and gradually work your way up
11-01-2020T20:36:54,johnnytho,swimming builds up AEROBIC BASE. Thats what ultimately makes it easy
11-01-2020T20:37:18,unsteddyphoenix,Could do a pick on the last poll instead

11-01-2020T21:03:54,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Hi Moon
11-01-2020T21:04:10,unsteddyphoenix,"Considering wolves average height is so high, that must be very short"
11-01-2020T21:04:30,IronHorseComics,"ah, good, I'd just use my 5'11'' build to tower over him and use my intimidation check"
11-01-2020T21:04:37,Twokinds,Yeah for a 'wolf' he looks extremely short by comparison
11-01-2020T21:04:49,ThingsAreMoving,A runt
11-01-2020T21:04:51,unsteddyphoenix,Got all the smol fox genes
11-01-2020T21:05:04,CrRAR,Haha
11-01-2020T21:05:27,Twokinds,"A lot of people underestimated him early in his career because of it. But it never really bothered Clovis too much, since they... you know, ended up dead or serving him, one way or another."
11-01-2020T21:05:29,ShamusTheFox,Now I'm picturing pimp daddy Clovis wearing platform shoes to cover up his shortness.
11-01-2020T21:05:33,ZoopBoopLoop,"in hindsight, maybe Nora shoulda turned Clovis into a Female Bastilin"
11-01-2020T21:05:43,ThingsAreMoving,:eyes: lore
11-01-2020T21:05:45,johnnytho,I'm as tall as Clovis
11-01-2020T21:05:46,unsteddyphoenix,Likely worked to his advantage
11-01-2020T21:05:48,ThingsAreMoving,me like
11-01-2020T21:06:13,Ordithus,I wonder if he got shorter after Nora got a hold of him
11-01-2020T21:06:22,Twokinds,Magic and money tends to even the playing field.
11-01-2020T21:06:29,CrRAR,Def got thicc’r
11-01-2020T21:06:29,ShamusTheFox,"How powerful is Clovis, magically speaking? He obviously knows more than he lets on."

11-01-2020T21:07:00,unsteddyphoenix,"Since he uses mainly magic items, more like money and money"
11-01-2020T21:07:05,Brocade,privilege matters a lot
11-01-2020T21:07:06,InTheLionsDen,Size matters not. Judge him by his size do you?
11-01-2020T21:07:09,ThingsAreMoving,"He probably rocks a high INT, doesn't he?"
11-01-2020T21:07:19,Twokinds,"Clovis is good with magic. He's not great, but he does have talent."
11-01-2020T21:07:24,AspiringNoodle,"Sooo, how does magic and money fare against angry flying draggos? :P"
11-01-2020T21:07:38,NezumiYuki,@Lion~ dat Yoda ref = gold
11-01-2020T21:07:39,CrRAR,He’s probably no Euchre but he’s kniving.
11-01-2020T21:07:39,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh ok, I see. I had a different impression"
11-01-2020T21:07:42,Twokinds,It's his money that really puts him over the edge into extremely good.
11-01-2020T21:07:50,unsteddyphoenix,High money stat
11-01-2020T21:07:54,Twokinds,Cause he buys enchantments that supplement his power.
11-01-2020T21:08:21,MuonNeutrino,where did he get all his money from? did he build up his criminal organization from scratch or take over someone else's or what?
11-01-2020T21:08:24,ThingsAreMoving,"Man, this is so much lore."
11-01-2020T21:08:25,BadFoMo,Hmm? When did the sketch get a fancy bordor?
11-01-2020T21:08:29,AspiringNoodle,Now I wanna see Clovis fight a Trace he pissed off into relapsing into darker magics :ptv-excited:

11-01-2020T21:08:43,IronHorseComics,"so he's the guy who gets suckered by EA's loot boxes, got it"
11-01-2020T21:08:44,Twokinds,"But yeah, a lot of people underestimate him thinking he's all money and no talent, but that's not true either. He's still good in his own right."
11-01-2020T21:08:44,ThingsAreMoving,"Cr, pls"
11-01-2020T21:08:50,ShamusTheFox,"So if Clovis had gotten caught in that magic suppression blast, he would have been extremely vulnerable."

11-01-2020T21:09:37,Twokinds,Possibly. But he's almost always surrounded by his hired muscle.

11-01-2020T21:13:09,ShamusTheFox,I am actually very glad for all this inside lore on Clovis. It's very interesting.
11-01-2020T21:13:21,unsteddyphoenix,noone killed CLOVIS's wife
11-01-2020T21:13:28,CrimsonHelsing,"and this is another thing of TwoKinds that reminds me of Star Wars (in a good way), Clovis is kinda like Tyber Zann in Legends. the head of the Zann Consortium in Empire at War: Forces of Corruption"

11-01-2020T21:15:55,ShamusTheFox,Thing that I'm figuring is he has to have an endgame to all of this. Money or power. I don't think he thinks he can beat the Templar with the dragons on their side.
11-01-2020T21:16:34,unsteddyphoenix,Inb4 fem clovis is going to stab clovis
