25-01-2020T09:25:03,TerraTheWizard,when the mask was talking as the smoke monster it had white text in a different font

25-01-2020T09:33:58,tehbear,also. Remote control spells. Like when Clovis took control over Natani in the dragon masquerade comic.
25-01-2020T09:35:31,TerraTheWizard,that needed a pretty big setup though so that's not really a casual spell
25-01-2020T09:35:57,tehbear,thankfully
25-01-2020T09:36:21,tehbear,and the masks can possess animals iirc. was a part where the templar was riding a horse that was a mask.. just after Team B escaped from the tavern. if i recall correct
25-01-2020T09:40:15,tehbear,hm. no. it was the Master Seer

25-01-2020T13:43:32,CrimsonQuill,Oh God...
25-01-2020T13:43:48,CrimsonQuill,The latest comic looks...ominous.
25-01-2020T13:44:07,CrimsonQuill,CrRAR referenced a suitable Halo quote in the forums...
25-01-2020T13:44:21,CrimsonQuill,"Seriously, whatever's going on in there, it is BAD"
25-01-2020T13:49:19,AspiringNoodle,I posed this last night
25-01-2020T13:49:36,AspiringNoodle,Odds are Trace was planning on taking Maren back to his manor near the beginning of the comic before Neutral wiped his memories
25-01-2020T13:50:00,CrimsonQuill,I wondered why Tom made her and Saria so similar...
25-01-2020T13:50:13,CrimsonQuill,I'm getting RvB Director vibes from this.
25-01-2020T13:50:37,CrimsonQuill,"""He kept trying to bring her back..."""
25-01-2020T13:52:49,AspiringNoodle,Also pointed that out
25-01-2020T13:53:25,AspiringNoodle,"Part of the reason Trace went genocidal maniac is because losing his wife broke him mentally, and then the dark magics from the attempts to revive her twisted his mind even further"
25-01-2020T13:53:31,CrimsonQuill,I see so many parallels between Twokinds and RvB these days...
25-01-2020T13:53:40,CrimsonQuill,Maybe I'm looking too hard
25-01-2020T13:53:57,Mippy,probs
25-01-2020T13:54:10,AspiringNoodle,A huge portion of Twokinds is uncovering bits and pieces of Trace's past.  This includes any plots that may still be in motion
25-01-2020T13:54:16,CrimsonQuill,And we have to remember what Nora told Trace herself in the Basitin Islands arc.
25-01-2020T13:54:38,CrimsonQuill,"Trace: ""So...it killed her...and that's why I did those terrible things."""
25-01-2020T13:55:22,AspiringNoodle,"Remember the one page where murdery Trace was dragging a dead / dying keidran by the scruff of their nake and was mumbling ""Kill my wife, will you?"""
25-01-2020T13:55:29,CrimsonQuill,"Nora: ""Yes...and No. Your wife's death was the start...but it was what you did afterewards that drove you over the edge...you tried to bring her back."""
25-01-2020T13:56:07,CrimsonQuill,"Again, the past holds dark secrets."
25-01-2020T13:56:28,CrimsonQuill,"My hope is that Trace figures out what he was doing, but is able to hold on to himself if his memories return."
25-01-2020T13:57:11,CrimsonQuill,"I believe that we'll soon have a battle in the centre of the mind...who knows, we could have Evil Black Smoke Hallucination make a body for itself and use that for all we know!"
25-01-2020T13:59:30,Mippy,blah blah blah epigenetics blah blah blah

25-01-2020T14:16:36,CrimsonQuill,I think I saw the suggestion last week
25-01-2020T14:16:45,CrimsonQuill,It rings a bell
25-01-2020T14:16:51,CrimsonQuill,Something with Karen in it?
25-01-2020T14:16:53,Twokinds,It looks like Raine
25-01-2020T14:17:05,CrimsonQuill,Could you tell us what it is?
25-01-2020T14:17:08,Twokinds,But the suggestion seems otherwise.
25-01-2020T14:17:09,Mippy,You think they'd look it up.... ._.:

25-01-2020T14:17:22,Twokinds,This feels like Reni.
25-01-2020T14:17:25,CrimsonQuill,It seems like it'd be Reni
25-01-2020T14:17:31,CrimsonQuill,Because dragons
25-01-2020T14:17:34,IronHorseComics,yeah that's gotta be Reni

25-01-2020T16:13:25,BadFoMo,Got mine in order.
25-01-2020T16:13:34,CrimsonQuill,Uh oh
25-01-2020T16:13:35,ShamusTheFox,Really liking the direction the story is going.
25-01-2020T16:13:43,CrimsonQuill,1mbs wifi soes not like stream
25-01-2020T16:13:50,ShamusTheFox,The Maren reveal was a mindtrip.
25-01-2020T16:14:01,SomeNiceUser,"Imagine a light, and where the shadows are."
25-01-2020T16:14:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Now that is one happy face <3
25-01-2020T16:14:16,Jaorek,"Stream is on well lets stay up till 2am again wheb its monday and work tomorow ,"
25-01-2020T16:14:22,CrimsonQuill,So...any advice on shading guys?
25-01-2020T16:14:29,CrimsonQuill,Because I really want to learn how
25-01-2020T16:14:51,Twokinds,Put shadows where light gets blocked by something.
25-01-2020T16:14:57,CrimsonQuill,Ha ha Tom
25-01-2020T16:15:00,CrimsonQuill,I know
25-01-2020T16:15:02,Roughlandin,"Woo! Finally out of my two-week noob time out! Hello, all!"
25-01-2020T16:15:05,ProsePro7,Always find a good tree
25-01-2020T16:15:06,SomeNiceUser,He's right you know.
25-01-2020T16:15:10,CrimsonQuill,"It's just...the little bumps and things"""
25-01-2020T16:15:13,CrimsonQuill,I know he's right
25-01-2020T16:15:15,Avolendi,Evenin peeps
25-01-2020T16:15:16,CrimsonQuill,It's the little things
25-01-2020T16:15:17,IronHorseComics,"I need to get better at it, and highlighting"
25-01-2020T16:15:18,ThingsAreMoving,That is a sound advice
25-01-2020T16:15:21,IronHorseComics,and other stuff
25-01-2020T16:15:23,CrimsonQuill,Hiya there Avolendi
25-01-2020T16:15:31,Twokinds,Yeah it's way easier said than done.
25-01-2020T16:15:34,CrimsonQuill,I really need to do more life drawing
25-01-2020T16:15:35,IronHorseComics,and not being crap and actually doing things
25-01-2020T16:15:37,tkpolls,[Poll] Round 1 [5.0 minutes left] - https://tkpolls.com
25-01-2020T16:15:44,Twokinds,But that's basically it. Just learning how to think in 3d and imaging what's blocking what.
25-01-2020T16:15:51,CrimsonQuill,Aheh...I'll try
25-01-2020T16:15:52,NeonMitsumi,Happy face :cneonmitsumi-katgoesnyoooooom:
25-01-2020T16:15:59,CrimsonQuill,I can do some things...very basically
25-01-2020T16:16:13,CatzArt,yeah o have those issues too Quill. its why i do gesture sketches as warm ups before every drawing sessiom
25-01-2020T16:16:14,Twokinds,Then it's largely technique. When to use soft and hard edges for shadows.
25-01-2020T16:16:20,CrimsonQuill,But the contours in muscleature and the wrinkles of clothes are a problem
25-01-2020T16:16:30,ShamusTheFox,I can dig it!
25-01-2020T16:16:35,CrimsonQuill,I'm also bad at that...soft vs hard
25-01-2020T16:16:35,IronHorseComics,if you ever look at my stuff you'll notice that I really only use one layer for shading...
25-01-2020T16:16:35,ProsePro7,Youll get it Crimson.  Me on the other had I just started drawing again and I have a long road
25-01-2020T16:16:41,Robbith,Coming at the right time to see my favourite girl
25-01-2020T16:16:45,johnnytho,so kobe died today
25-01-2020T16:16:50,Robbith,Pls tell me it's Kat
25-01-2020T16:16:52,CrimsonQuill,I still haven't posted that pic yet...;
25-01-2020T16:16:52,BadFoMo,I just gave up drawing.
25-01-2020T16:16:57,IronHorseComics,probably needs more but to me that's like solving advanced calculus
25-01-2020T16:16:58,CrimsonQuill,@Johnnytho Kobe?
25-01-2020T16:17:01,ShamusTheFox,"I saw that, helicopter crash."
25-01-2020T16:17:02,CrimsonQuill,A pet?
25-01-2020T16:17:06,IronHorseComics,Kobe Bryant
25-01-2020T16:17:11,CrimsonQuill,Who's that?
25-01-2020T16:17:11,IronHorseComics,NBA Legend
25-01-2020T16:17:11,Roughlandin,The sportsball guy

25-01-2020T16:17:24,Avolendi,Made/got some time to do some more structure practising the coming time :)
25-01-2020T16:17:25,SomeNiceUser,"Hard is used for sharp geometry, while soft is used around round stuff."
25-01-2020T16:17:33,CrimsonQuill,Mmm
25-01-2020T16:17:33,Avolendi,*structured
25-01-2020T16:17:37,Roughlandin,The one you yell when you want to dunk on the trash
25-01-2020T16:17:39,CrimsonHelsing,"I heard about that on the way home, Angry Joe tweeted about that"
25-01-2020T16:17:39,BeeMill,"Hey, sketch stream!"
25-01-2020T16:17:48,CrimsonQuill,Hiya Helsing
25-01-2020T16:17:51,ShamusTheFox,41. He was a year younger than me. I never knew I was older than he was.

25-01-2020T16:18:37,CrimsonQuill,Damn 1mbs router
25-01-2020T16:18:40,BadFoMo,Sorry.
25-01-2020T16:18:46,CatzArt,that sucks quill
25-01-2020T16:18:50,ShamusTheFox,Animal ears are so much more aesthetically pleasing (to me) than human ears.
25-01-2020T16:18:54,CrimsonQuill,Well
25-01-2020T16:18:59,Roughlandin,I just now realized I hadn't pressed play on the stream yet lol
25-01-2020T16:19:00,BeeMill,Laughs in using mobile data
25-01-2020T16:19:01,CrimsonQuill,I could always tell my landlady

25-01-2020T16:22:00,Brocade,he might have missed one or two things
25-01-2020T16:22:01,ThingsAreMoving,I wasn't there
25-01-2020T16:22:10,Roughlandin,Didn't miss the Con Crud apparently
25-01-2020T16:22:20,CrimsonQuill,Stream doesn't like me so I'll be back in a bit
25-01-2020T16:22:27,CrimsonQuill,Time for some Gruntpocalypes

25-01-2020T16:23:24,CrimsonHelsing,I hope SWTOR can be played smoothly while my browser is on
25-01-2020T16:23:39,CrimsonHelsing,not very trusting of this old late 2000s cpu
25-01-2020T16:24:03,BadFoMo,"Oh, this is the high five with Mike one."
25-01-2020T16:24:11,Neoter,"i think ill check back later, im having problems even with my connection"
25-01-2020T16:24:26,Avolendi,Stream here also bugging out/lagging about 99 out of 100 seconds
25-01-2020T16:24:27,Roughlandin,Honestly it's probably better on that than newer hardware. I've heard SWOTOR isn't exactly future friendly
25-01-2020T16:24:57,BeeMill,I could tell it was mike as soon as he drew the eyes haha
25-01-2020T16:25:13,CrimsonHelsing,even at minimum/optimized settings?
25-01-2020T16:25:40,BeeMill,I guess it‚Äôs never even occurred to me that they characters have different eye styles
25-01-2020T16:26:03,CrimsonHelsing,a lot of details that set characters apart if you take the time to observe ^^
25-01-2020T16:26:11,Greendyes,"what the hell this is seriously the one strwam that is bugging out for me, tried 2 on yt, 3 on twitch and 5 on picarto and this is the only stuttering one"
25-01-2020T16:26:34,Roughlandin,I dunno. I ain't a computer wiz sorry lol. I just put in enough deditated wam to wun the sewver.
25-01-2020T16:27:01,CrimsonHelsing,lol
25-01-2020T16:27:09,CrimsonHelsing,PS that game is hella fun so far
25-01-2020T16:27:29,FloofyCat,"My internet is playing up so badly, heck."
25-01-2020T16:27:34,BeeMill,I‚Äôm curious what‚Äôs gonna be happening on the right that demands mike be drawn on the far left
25-01-2020T16:27:37,CrimsonHelsing,"good job for BioWare, easy to forget I'm playing an MMO"
25-01-2020T16:27:46,Roughlandin,"As it is my first stream in the chat and I'm not having problems, everyone feel free to blame me"
25-01-2020T16:29:32,BeeMill,Will do
25-01-2020T16:29:50,Roughlandin,YAY! It's all my fault somehow!
25-01-2020T16:30:01,Avolendi,"Might be a regional thing with picarto servers or so. No clue how it structured, but considering some people have lots of issues and some/many don't ^^;"
25-01-2020T16:30:10,Avolendi,*it is
25-01-2020T16:30:24,Xexanoth,it usually is with picarto
25-01-2020T16:30:42,ShamusTheFox,"Remember, high fives require precision and timing. Do not attempt without proper supervision."
25-01-2020T16:30:52,Roughlandin,I'm just sitting here in an Indiana cornfield with my router strapped to a cow. Don't mind me everybody.
25-01-2020T16:31:04,Mippy,Stream got deaded for a moment
25-01-2020T16:31:13,ShamusTheFox,The cow-router is advanced tech.
25-01-2020T16:31:19,Cmndrwolf,felina feral is best feline. are their any arguments or grevinves with this claim?
25-01-2020T16:31:21,BeeMill,Failure to follow proper high-five safety protocols may result in broken wrists
25-01-2020T16:31:26,Roughlandin,It's very green energy
25-01-2020T16:31:31,horoisawolf,"eh, stream extremely erratic for me, but as i have trouble loading images in discord while stream is running, i'd rather blame my ISP..."
25-01-2020T16:31:46,Xexanoth,cow router is the next step up from hamster modem
25-01-2020T16:32:02,Avolendi,"Mine is dead roughly 99% of the time unfortunately. Will see how it goes for a bit, but then probably off for now"
25-01-2020T16:32:22,AtomowyJohny,same
25-01-2020T16:32:36,Greendyes,nah my stream is partially dead too unfortunately

25-01-2020T16:32:52,AtomowyJohny,i'm using mobile data XD
25-01-2020T16:32:53,ShamusTheFox,"If your cow-router experiences a system failure, do not try to reboot. It's dead, move on."
25-01-2020T16:32:57,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-shock:
25-01-2020T16:33:03,AspiringNoodle,"Johny, nuuuuuu"
25-01-2020T16:33:11,Roughlandin,Try taking your router off the cow and putting it on a mustang. I hear they get more horsepower
25-01-2020T16:33:15,AspiringNoodle,Think of the cap and over-use charges!
25-01-2020T16:33:17,Mippy,"Naw, I just live far enough north that the cold makes tech act funny"
25-01-2020T16:33:36,unsteddyphoenix,Kats so cute~ <3 <3

25-01-2020T16:36:40,Roughlandin,Was this an argument

25-01-2020T16:38:12,AspiringNoodle,"It would be only fair if Mike went lady and Kat ends up groping her, too :P"
25-01-2020T16:38:21,Roughlandin,Because it's Mike. Can you even get mad at Mike? Is that a thing people can do?
25-01-2020T16:38:27,ShamusTheFox,"Thing is, we've ALL missed high fives."
25-01-2020T16:38:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Watch as they do that creepy faceoff running hand down face thing.
25-01-2020T16:38:36,Roughlandin,Watch the elbow
25-01-2020T16:38:43,AspiringNoodle,But how many end up with one party groping the chest of the other party? :ptv-snicker:
25-01-2020T16:39:23,ShamusTheFox,"Your honor, I plead the fifth."
25-01-2020T16:39:26,Brocade,"ohoho, I'm glad this was picked :3"

25-01-2020T16:40:25,Brocade,so is Mike bi or what?
25-01-2020T16:40:52,Roughlandin,Mike is mike. Mike like what Mike like. Everyone is fine with this.
25-01-2020T16:40:53,Mippy,Mike is bilateral
25-01-2020T16:40:58,unsteddyphoenix,straight with inescapable gay thoughts
25-01-2020T16:41:00,Avolendi,"Not sure, he's portrayed as fem-mike so often, it's anyone's guess what he is :P"

25-01-2020T16:41:50,unsteddyphoenix,"idk man, one could argue thats the best result to come from a hi5"
25-01-2020T16:42:04,Brocade,I'm a one-person army trying to make Mike x Evals happen X3

25-01-2020T16:43:04,Greendyes,lmao
25-01-2020T16:43:07,Avolendi,That's fine. Pretty sure I part of a very small minority who tries to always interpret any shipping comments as naval actions :P
25-01-2020T16:43:11,ShamusTheFox,Mike hand slaps breast. Cue breast wobble. This continues for...5 panels.
25-01-2020T16:43:13,thestooge2222,This isn't a miss! it's a hit!!!
25-01-2020T16:43:18,ArdTheDragon,He youched the boob
25-01-2020T16:43:23,Roughlandin,Also you could probably ship Mike with ANYBODY and it'd be adorable

25-01-2020T16:43:46,Avolendi,"Might be a bit cramped, depending on how you ship em"
25-01-2020T16:44:00,Roughlandin,Eh I'm a KaZen boi

25-01-2020T16:49:25,ShamusTheFox,Hard to tell with Kat.
25-01-2020T16:49:27,Roughlandin,Mike apologizes profusely. Kat just laughs because she knows it was an accident.
25-01-2020T16:49:28,AnuSekaniArt,And oh my word this pic XD
25-01-2020T16:49:45,KeithTheKeiser,Most likely
25-01-2020T16:49:56,Roughlandin,Then she tells him he can put it back if he wants
25-01-2020T16:50:01,Roughlandin,XD
25-01-2020T16:50:01,Trianwart,XD
25-01-2020T16:50:01,Brocade,I can't wait to finish building my new pc so I don't have to burn my lap from my laptop getting so hot watching picarto
25-01-2020T16:50:09,ThingsAreMoving,Kat should grope Mike's ass as a fair exchange :ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:
25-01-2020T16:50:14,IronHorseComics,"Kat's probably like ""*Sigh* You're not the one I wanted to touch the boob"""

25-01-2020T16:50:25,KeithTheKeiser,Eric..

25-01-2020T16:50:38,ShamusTheFox,"Well, I mean, he should know better. You don't high five with opposing hands. Right hand + right hand, left hand + left hand."
25-01-2020T16:50:38,Roughlandin,HA! Called it!
25-01-2020T16:50:42,Sclimshady,How hard was he high fiving to miss that bad?
25-01-2020T16:50:48,Brocade,I think hotter content makes my laptop run hotter :laughing:
25-01-2020T16:50:58,IronHorseComics,"do it with your eyes closed, obviouslyt"
25-01-2020T16:51:02,CrimsonQuill,It certainly gives me a nosebleed
25-01-2020T16:51:02,Roughlandin,"I'm telling you, man! You gotta watch the elbow. Never miss again"
25-01-2020T16:51:24,CrimsonQuill,I'm trying to think of something Lavernius Tucker would say in this situation.
25-01-2020T16:51:40,Greendyes,wait your laptop is blowing hot? mine isn't even fanning atm
25-01-2020T16:51:40,Trianwart,:o

25-01-2020T16:52:02,Roughlandin,"Sure, blame the laptop for why your lap is hot right now"
25-01-2020T16:52:04,ShamusTheFox,Chris Tucker would say something loud and high pitched.
25-01-2020T16:52:04,Greendyes,^
25-01-2020T16:52:14,CrimsonQuill,"""Hey there dude, I see you grabbed a nice pair of pillows! Bow chicka Bow Wow!"

25-01-2020T16:52:22,CrimsonQuill,Kat would then probably slap him.

25-01-2020T16:54:09,Roughlandin,Because Mike is a pure boi. He deserve ze bob
25-01-2020T16:54:17,Mippy,He would have got a message....

25-01-2020T16:54:38,KeithTheKeiser,XD
25-01-2020T16:54:52,Roughlandin,Trace accepts. Flora leaves him. Because that's how respecting your SO works

25-01-2020T16:57:42,Avolendi,"Regarding the most recent naval movements though, should check if there's a new page up, since Tom's been outmanouvering everyone (ish) with his own sudden canon move :P"
25-01-2020T16:57:44,Mippy,Yes?
25-01-2020T16:57:51,ThingsAreMoving,Precious one
25-01-2020T16:58:18,ShamusTheFox,No lie. The new page explains a LOT.
25-01-2020T16:58:21,IronHorseComics,"hey Avo, that's a rather suspicious looking smoke screen up ahead"
25-01-2020T16:58:33,IronHorseComics,you think it's packing torpedoes?
25-01-2020T16:58:37,Roughlandin,New page goes from zero to 9000 quick
25-01-2020T16:58:53,Katfeathers,Much uh oh
25-01-2020T16:58:54,Roughlandin,"The big question is who ""we"" are"
25-01-2020T16:58:55,Avolendi,Ooooh. Well that took an unexpected turn O.o
25-01-2020T16:59:00,tehbear,new page goes from 9000 to -9000 real quick
25-01-2020T16:59:20,Roughlandin,"From ""plot"" to olot"
25-01-2020T16:59:23,Roughlandin,plot
25-01-2020T16:59:23,TheSexyBeast,New page went in an unexpected direction (to me) I can't wait to see what happens next
25-01-2020T16:59:44,Roughlandin,I figured there was something up with creepy red person gem
25-01-2020T16:59:44,unsteddyphoenix,it goes from spicy to sour
25-01-2020T17:00:13,Roughlandin,"Also, I REALLY never noticed how similar Maren and Saria looked"
25-01-2020T17:00:18,Katfeathers,With a sharp gooseneck
25-01-2020T17:00:35,ShamusTheFox,"After all this is over, Maren is probably going to be downright livid with Trace."
25-01-2020T17:00:35,steelabjur,There are bubbles behind that red glass it looks like.
25-01-2020T17:00:45,Roughlandin,The question is... did Old Trace notice too? And how much of that was the cause of their relationship?
25-01-2020T17:01:08,johnnytho,The newest page shocked me. Tom wrote one of the biggests twists of my life
25-01-2020T17:01:16,TheSexyBeast,"I think very likely, Rough"
25-01-2020T17:01:29,Roughlandin,Yeah same. Old Trace is a bastard man
25-01-2020T17:01:52,Twokinds,"Old Trace was searching for candidates. People close enough, from backwater towns who wouldn't be missed."
25-01-2020T17:01:54,steelabjur,"@Roughlandin, I'd say 99.9%-100%"
25-01-2020T17:02:00,ShamusTheFox,His love for Saria probably overshadowed everything else.
25-01-2020T17:02:14,Roughlandin,This makes sense. Old Trace was a BIG bastard man. Poor Maren
25-01-2020T17:02:20,TheSexyBeast,"Going to cause friction among the guests, I believe"
25-01-2020T17:02:43,Twokinds,"Obviously, he didn't really think of Maren as a girlfriend. He tested tranformation on Karen, and planned to test more magic on Maren."
25-01-2020T17:02:50,Avolendi,"Kinda got the impression that was already known, at least for the audience, with Maren mentioning how the relationship wasn't much of anything if I recall correctly"
25-01-2020T17:03:06,Roughlandin,Oof. Poor Maren.
25-01-2020T17:03:13,Roughlandin,And Karen
25-01-2020T17:03:25,Roughlandin,And... literally everything Old Trace touched
25-01-2020T17:03:26,ShamusTheFox,I have to ask...did you plan this from the start? Cause if so...MASTERFUL move.
25-01-2020T17:03:28,tehbear,Karen didnt mind getting keidran ears.
25-01-2020T17:03:32,unsteddyphoenix,warning signs were all there..
25-01-2020T17:03:35,CrimsonQuill,Well
25-01-2020T17:03:42,BadFoMo,Back-ish. I was starting to think that.
25-01-2020T17:03:43,Greendyes,poor Maren literally became a tool
25-01-2020T17:03:48,CrimsonQuill,We know that Trace as Grand Templar was a strategist
25-01-2020T17:03:57,TheSexyBeast,Tom = Oda
25-01-2020T17:04:10,IronHorseComics,"a strategist, and a bastard"
25-01-2020T17:04:19,BadFoMo,Oda?
25-01-2020T17:04:24,steelabjur,"Trace kinda gave Karen cat ears because she annoyed him one, he was that kind of a bastard."
25-01-2020T17:04:36,steelabjur,*once
25-01-2020T17:04:46,Roughlandin,So we're going from Beach Party to probably the biggest plot moment of the entire series so far?
25-01-2020T17:05:01,Roughlandin,...Ooooh. It's gonna be a goodie
25-01-2020T17:05:04,AnuSekaniArt,I have wondered how much of a latency there is between where Tom has the story written and where the latest page is XD
25-01-2020T17:05:05,Avolendi,"Also Iron. Think so, but I keep wondering if I'm missing a deeper interpretation :p"
25-01-2020T17:05:08,Katfeathers,"Oda Nobunaga, yes?"
25-01-2020T17:05:13,Brocade,"inb4 Kat's like ""it's no problem! You just need consent!"" Mike: ""oh, phew"" Kat: ""wanna touch 'em?"""
25-01-2020T17:05:43,BadFoMo,Evals: It's a trap!
25-01-2020T17:05:45,TheSexyBeast,Oda = creator of One Piece
25-01-2020T17:06:03,Avolendi,"Bocade: Was wondering if that'd happen, but don't think so :P"
25-01-2020T17:06:06,Twokinds,Done
25-01-2020T17:06:07,AtomowyJohny,"i,ve got question out of place is enone hehe racing rc cars like 1/8 buggy?"
25-01-2020T17:06:12,jirka,Very Nice Tom

25-01-2020T17:06:28,CrimsonQuill,Good work!
25-01-2020T17:06:28,BadFoMo,Thanks. Never really seen One Piece.
25-01-2020T17:06:30,unsteddyphoenix,Youre pretty good though too tom great work!
25-01-2020T17:06:34,AtomowyJohny,nice
25-01-2020T17:06:51,Katfeathers,"Ah, other Oda. Nobunaga, iirc, was hecken strategist too."
25-01-2020T17:07:07,Roughlandin,The most wholesome accidental boob grab. That's why I love these two
25-01-2020T17:07:35,Mippy,k
25-01-2020T17:07:41,unsteddyphoenix,"Kat doesnt cliche freak out or anything,just laughs it off~"
25-01-2020T17:08:02,Roughlandin,She kinda did on Zen. But I think that was more surprise than anything
25-01-2020T17:08:19,Greendyes,"also, there's a difference between a hand and a face"
25-01-2020T17:08:22,ThingsAreMoving,Kat the real MVP
25-01-2020T17:08:49,Katfeathers,Likely part of how Erics parents trained her
25-01-2020T17:09:01,unsteddyphoenix,the heroine we need...
25-01-2020T17:09:13,ThingsAreMoving,:eyes:
25-01-2020T17:09:27,Roughlandin,"Or just a keidran thing. When you don't put so many weird taboos around a single piece of anatomy, it stops being such a thing"
25-01-2020T17:09:39,CrimsonQuill,I suppose
25-01-2020T17:09:46,unsteddyphoenix,Thered be no drama cause kat would just react in a mature reasonable way
25-01-2020T17:09:59,Avolendi,And vice versa with the ankles for Basitins xD
25-01-2020T17:10:07,Roughlandin,Exactly
25-01-2020T17:10:14,CrimsonQuill,"One question I do have though, is, does accustomisation to something like that cause any decrease in appeal?>"
25-01-2020T17:10:18,Roughlandin,Weird social taboos are powerful
25-01-2020T17:10:45,Roughlandin,Idk. I've had a convo about that exact thing with some female friends of mine
25-01-2020T17:11:08,Roughlandin,"Like, they're just boobs. I like them, but they're just boobs"
25-01-2020T17:11:14,ThingsAreMoving,She's constantly walking around topless anyway. You'd assume accidental touches are common place with her boobs.
25-01-2020T17:11:23,Katfeathers,"Maybe, but she was bread for a purpose. And I don't think Eric's family would have seen it as raising"
25-01-2020T17:11:46,ThingsAreMoving,"Bread? Marv, I need your emote pls"
25-01-2020T17:11:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:cmarvthehugpharaoh-DummyThicc:
25-01-2020T17:11:56,Roughlandin,I want my friends to be comfortable and not feel like their body is taboo... but I don't want to stop liking boobs.
25-01-2020T17:12:02,Avolendi,xD
25-01-2020T17:12:03,ThingsAreMoving,Thank you bro

25-01-2020T17:12:36,Roughlandin,MMm... bread
25-01-2020T17:12:40,IronHorseComics,she's probably known Mike long enough to know he wouldn't do it on purpose...
25-01-2020T17:12:51,Roughlandin,^^^
25-01-2020T17:12:54,Twokinds,Yeah
25-01-2020T17:12:56,Katfeathers,"Yeah, my shpellin can be blunk firs at times"
25-01-2020T17:13:15,ThingsAreMoving,"It's ok, laugh it off with us"
25-01-2020T17:13:22,ThingsAreMoving,That's what mistakes are for
25-01-2020T17:13:31,ThingsAreMoving,Be like Kat
25-01-2020T17:13:33,IronHorseComics,"Zen, she had only just met"
25-01-2020T17:14:02,ProsePro7,Kat X Zen
25-01-2020T17:14:08,tehbear,It seems like Kat might have a thing for Zen
25-01-2020T17:14:09,Twokinds,As long as it's accidental it's fine.
25-01-2020T17:14:11,Katfeathers,:shades:
25-01-2020T17:14:25,Roughlandin,Or you ask REALLY nice
25-01-2020T17:14:58,tehbear,"I dont think Kat, Mike or Evals have that kind of feelings for each other.."
25-01-2020T17:15:09,ThingsAreMoving,"Unless it's Eric, probably. Would she interpret it as 'first move' from him even if it was an accident?"
25-01-2020T17:15:10,tehbear,actually Kat is the wierd one wrt who her feelings to Eric
25-01-2020T17:15:42,tehbear,but it could be because she doesnt think she has any other alternatives or something
25-01-2020T17:15:46,tehbear,idk
25-01-2020T17:16:10,KeefMcDerpface,hello
25-01-2020T17:16:20,tehbear,Hello Keef
25-01-2020T17:16:22,ThingsAreMoving,o/
25-01-2020T17:16:52,tehbear,"Things: knowing Kat, probably... but maybe previously in comic before Eric was mean to Evals and Mike"
25-01-2020T17:17:05,KeefMcDerpface,Is this a Clovis I see?
25-01-2020T17:17:12,Roughlandin,"Yeah, but I think Kat kind of got past that on the boat back to the mainland"
25-01-2020T17:17:46,Roughlandin,"Clovis: ""Haha! I'm in danger."""
25-01-2020T17:17:51,ThingsAreMoving,"Well, that's when she got 'sisterblocked' wasn't it?"
25-01-2020T17:18:12,tehbear,I think traveling might have done Kat some good. Dont like the thought of her with Eric
25-01-2020T17:18:23,tehbear,Kat+Zen otoh :3
25-01-2020T17:18:31,Roughlandin,It really doesn't fit. Eric is too... Eric.
25-01-2020T17:19:16,Roughlandin,But sometimes people need to see that on their own. I think Kat's finally doing that. Learning who she is without being defined by her relationship to Eric
25-01-2020T17:19:21,ThingsAreMoving,I think she'll grow out of it eventually. Or become so assertive she'll just find a way to get him
25-01-2020T17:19:30,unsteddyphoenix,yeah eric belongs with Raine
25-01-2020T17:19:37,tehbear,"Keef: yes, this is brutus and clovis"
25-01-2020T17:19:42,ThingsAreMoving,Anyway there's a lot of character development potential for her
25-01-2020T17:19:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Teddy no
25-01-2020T17:19:55,ThingsAreMoving,"kiwibro, I respect your opinion, but nah"
25-01-2020T17:19:58,ThingsAreMoving,Raine x Maren
25-01-2020T17:20:00,ProsePro7,I love Shantae
25-01-2020T17:20:04,unsteddyphoenix,ERIC X RAINE OTP
25-01-2020T17:20:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Ban him
25-01-2020T17:20:15,QuinnMalachite,Eric x Raine is a crack ship and a half. I like it
25-01-2020T17:20:27,IronHorseComics,it's shit
25-01-2020T17:20:34,Roughlandin,"Eric is a... free spirit. He likes to... get around. Which is fine, but I don't think he'd ever let himself be defined by a single relationship"
25-01-2020T17:20:34,unsteddyphoenix,pervpair
25-01-2020T17:20:59,ThingsAreMoving,"...there is some weird, twisted logic in your reasoning"
25-01-2020T17:21:18,CrimsonQuill,"He wouldn't get near Raine anyway, she's very shy and Red'd yell, ""Back off you bastard!"""
25-01-2020T17:21:31,Roughlandin,"I mean different strokes for different folks. I don't condone it, but if everybody's cool, do what ye will"
25-01-2020T17:21:41,IronHorseComics,and people will finally stop blindly hating Red when he stabs Eric
25-01-2020T17:22:01,Roughlandin,Or you know... they learn characters grow
25-01-2020T17:22:06,KeefMcDerpface,But Kat will hate him.
25-01-2020T17:22:11,Roughlandin,And to do that they have to have flaws first
25-01-2020T17:22:15,ThingsAreMoving,Red would be too busy polishing his sword for more meaningless battle
25-01-2020T17:22:17,unsteddyphoenix,"reds a big dumb jock, raine needs someone well red"

25-01-2020T17:32:20,ThingsAreMoving,Can confirm
25-01-2020T17:32:24,Roughlandin,"Or is it ""a moving target catches more lead""?"
25-01-2020T17:32:36,CrimsonQuill,Aheh
25-01-2020T17:32:46,tehbear,only if it moves into the bullets

25-01-2020T17:34:21,Avolendi,:P
25-01-2020T17:34:56,tehbear,its almost hard to imagine Brutus and Clovis are the same species
25-01-2020T17:35:07,Roughlandin,I mean... they kind of aren't
25-01-2020T17:35:09,Greendyes,^partially
25-01-2020T17:35:10,Katfeathers,Fighty adorkableness

25-01-2020T17:35:58,tehbear,a medic charched brutus.
25-01-2020T17:35:58,CrimsonQuill,This is anOOC is serious business moment
25-01-2020T17:35:58,Roughlandin,"Even so, I look at some dudes at the gym and have a hard time believing we're the same species sometimes"
25-01-2020T17:35:59,unsteddyphoenix,daddy brutus here to mess u up
25-01-2020T17:36:01,Avolendi,Hi
25-01-2020T17:36:02,Dimensional,Brutus scared off the attackers by removing his pants.
25-01-2020T17:36:04,tehbear,I imagine he speaks like heavy from TF2
25-01-2020T17:36:09,ThingsAreMoving,Brutus: Brutus will SMASH your face and then he'll SMASH that female behind him!
25-01-2020T17:36:11,Rolley,Why is Brutus so mad
25-01-2020T17:36:15,KeefMcDerpface,"No, Brutus is 50/50. 50% wolf, 50% fluff."
25-01-2020T17:36:19,CrimsonQuill,"When Brutus is angry, you KNOW you're dead"
25-01-2020T17:36:22,Katfeathers,"Nah, not Hulk, kid Goku"
25-01-2020T17:36:23,PalmettoPathfinder1,Now I really want a Brutus ref sheet!
25-01-2020T17:36:24,AspiringNoodle,"Keef, no"
25-01-2020T17:36:25,Greendyes,imagine Butus but with goofy's voice
25-01-2020T17:36:28,Corinthian,@Rolley Someone ate his tendies
25-01-2020T17:36:29,AspiringNoodle,"Brutus is 1% wolf, 99% fluff"
25-01-2020T17:36:32,ShamusTheFox,Oooh. Brutus vs Keith faceoff. That would be an impressive fight.
25-01-2020T17:36:34,TheSexyBeast,I like how Brutus' fur is ruffled up in preparation to fight
25-01-2020T17:36:38,AspiringNoodle,And 100% muscle :ptv-snicker:
25-01-2020T17:36:43,Roughlandin,Secret fun fact: Brutus wears weighted clothes
25-01-2020T17:36:46,Rolley,Haha
25-01-2020T17:36:56,ThingsAreMoving,Weighted fluff
25-01-2020T17:37:05,Brocade,Brutus looks so heroic <3
25-01-2020T17:37:30,Roughlandin,"This picture of Brutus is in the dictionary under ""rigteous fury"""
25-01-2020T17:37:32,KeefMcDerpface,"Oh sh*t, he took off his shirt."
25-01-2020T17:37:33,Katfeathers,But can he weponize the adorkableness?
25-01-2020T17:37:51,ShamusTheFox,I am still voicing Brutus as Kronk in my head.
25-01-2020T17:37:53,Rolley,My stream is down but not my chat
25-01-2020T17:38:11,AnuSekaniArt,Clovis doesn't deserve Brutus. He's too loyal and lovable for him :P
25-01-2020T17:38:18,CrimsonQuill,I want to see just what horror Clovis is capable of.
25-01-2020T17:38:21,KeefMcDerpface,He means business now.
25-01-2020T17:38:27,CrimsonQuill,I want to see their darkest side.
25-01-2020T17:38:29,TheSexyBeast,Brutus vs. Floofy Keith
25-01-2020T17:38:35,CrimsonQuill,So that we see the monster within.
25-01-2020T17:38:36,tehbear,Clovis would betray anyone. Even brutus.
25-01-2020T17:38:44,ThingsAreMoving,"I wonder if Mekkan has it's unique fighting styles :thinking: Tom, ever thought of that?"
25-01-2020T17:38:49,Avolendi,Had that earlier a lot Rolly. Been stable here for a while now though
25-01-2020T17:38:52,CrimsonQuill,And I want to see Trace during HIS days as a monster.
25-01-2020T17:39:12,steelabjur,"Brutus is 98% fluff, 1% Wolf, and 1% ""Are you going to eat that egg?"" ;p"
25-01-2020T17:39:14,CrimsonQuill,"Covered in blood, slaughtering innocents..."
25-01-2020T17:39:23,tehbear,steeljabur: hah!
25-01-2020T17:39:26,Rolley,Lol steel
25-01-2020T17:39:28,AspiringNoodle,Brutus has the ultimate fighting style
25-01-2020T17:39:40,CrimsonQuill,"""KilL mY wIfE Will yOu?!"

25-01-2020T17:39:59,ShamusTheFox,"Given that berzerk Trace is pretty powerful, I would say an in-control Evil Trace would be a terror and a half."

25-01-2020T17:40:53,tehbear,"I imagine evil Trace was a bit like a mopey teenager. Harmless most of the time, but prone to sudden irrational behaviour"
25-01-2020T17:40:55,ThingsAreMoving,o/ Zaky
25-01-2020T17:41:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Give him a hug in my name
25-01-2020T17:41:12,CrimsonHelsing,"sounds about right, tehbear"
25-01-2020T17:41:22,KeefMcDerpface,"Again, I can see Brutus as the Doom guy, glory kills for all."
25-01-2020T17:41:27,johnnytho,well trace is as old as a college student so that idea isnt far fetched
25-01-2020T17:41:27,CrimsonHelsing,he was pretty young when all this happened
25-01-2020T17:41:27,tehbear,^
25-01-2020T17:41:42,IronHorseComics,Trace is 25
25-01-2020T17:41:51,KeefMcDerpface,And chainsaw for the rest.
25-01-2020T17:41:56,johnnytho,lil older
25-01-2020T17:42:00,WereKeidran,arrives
25-01-2020T17:42:04,WereKeidran,what'd i miss?

25-01-2020T17:42:10,KeefMcDerpface,hello
25-01-2020T17:42:11,tehbear,a high five?
25-01-2020T17:42:18,ShamusTheFox,"Boob slap, Were."
25-01-2020T17:42:18,johnnytho,were this is the 2nd sketch
25-01-2020T17:42:21,CrimsonHelsing,"but all this started plenty of years prior, Iron. he might have practically been in his teens at the start of everything terrible that happened"
25-01-2020T17:42:26,Rolley,Yo were what up
25-01-2020T17:42:37,Roughlandin,"So, truth time. Clovis is secretly my favorite character and I hope his character arc ends with a heel change and him realizing how stupid his revenge plot is and running away to live with Brutus."
25-01-2020T17:42:38,Greendyes,aight guys gotta go. goodnight
25-01-2020T17:42:41,WereKeidran,"not much, just got back from a con volunteer meeting"
25-01-2020T17:42:44,steelabjur,"@tehbear I'm more in the ""Evil Trace was  omnicidal maniac"" camp, myself."
25-01-2020T17:42:46,ThingsAreMoving,gn green o/
25-01-2020T17:42:54,KeefMcDerpface,bye green
25-01-2020T17:42:56,Rolley,GN green
25-01-2020T17:43:00,Katfeathers,begins upping the static
25-01-2020T17:43:19,IronHorseComics,or he'll just go after Brahn
25-01-2020T17:43:27,tehbear,"steeljabur: but if that was so, why did Nora and Saria put up with him?"
25-01-2020T17:43:34,falangie123,what was the sketch before this??
25-01-2020T17:43:45,IronHorseComics,Saria was dead
25-01-2020T17:43:55,KeefMcDerpface,Saria died before all hell broke lose.
25-01-2020T17:44:03,falangie123,damn rip
25-01-2020T17:44:04,KeefMcDerpface,"As for Nora, idk."
25-01-2020T17:44:04,Roughlandin,I think Old Trace was just REALLY driven by power and had no moral compass
25-01-2020T17:44:06,IronHorseComics,Nora was in a different location
25-01-2020T17:44:18,tehbear,true. but Trace wasnt entirely a moral character even before Sarias death
25-01-2020T17:44:22,Roughlandin,Then Saria died and he wanted to burn the world
25-01-2020T17:44:34,CrimsonHelsing,"old Trace was quite young when Saria died, so he wasn't entirely stable back then. and that was years before the start of the story"
25-01-2020T17:45:01,ProsePro7,So is it the Masks in the story or something else that is trying to possess Marin?
25-01-2020T17:45:11,CrimsonHelsing,black mana and grief only multiplied that instability to the nth degree
25-01-2020T17:45:16,KeefMcDerpface,Marin?
25-01-2020T17:45:19,Roughlandin,"That's what I'm wondering, Prose"
25-01-2020T17:45:25,Katfeathers,"Dot rem, ""Old/Evil"" Trace was a stage resultant of Sarias death"
25-01-2020T17:45:27,Roughlandin,"Who are ""we"""
25-01-2020T17:45:27,ThingsAreMoving,Maren :ctwokinds-eyeroll:
25-01-2020T17:45:28,tehbear,Maren :ctwokinds-eyeroll:
25-01-2020T17:45:29,KeefMcDerpface,Don't you mean Maren.
25-01-2020T17:45:33,ShamusTheFox,"How long was there between Saria's death and Trace's memory loss? 2, 3 years?"
25-01-2020T17:45:36,ThingsAreMoving,Ayy tehbear
25-01-2020T17:45:45,KeefMcDerpface,4 years.
25-01-2020T17:45:48,steelabjur,"Yep, Saria's death sort of sent him to crazy town, and the Mask took advantage of one of the most powerful living magic users rage and sadness to push him further over the edge."
25-01-2020T17:45:49,ProsePro7,I'm writing at the same time as this on my lap top
25-01-2020T17:46:19,CrimsonHelsing,"something, or someone, that, for some reason, is still in that estate, and they are somehow still loyal to Trace's goal (which I thought he abandoned when he became grand templar and swore vengeance)"
25-01-2020T17:46:35,KeefMcDerpface,I guess not.
25-01-2020T17:46:52,ProsePro7,Its not Saria's spirit because they refer to her in the 3rd person
25-01-2020T17:46:58,tehbear,and Trace still has the smokey voice in his head from time to time
25-01-2020T17:47:02,ShamusTheFox,My theory is that Mrs. Nibbly somehow ties into this.
25-01-2020T17:47:13,Roughlandin,And apparently whoever is in the gem thing isn't Saria's body
25-01-2020T17:47:19,TheSexyBeast,Rose
25-01-2020T17:47:21,CrimsonQuill,We shall see
25-01-2020T17:47:22,CrimsonHelsing,"who or what the hell they are, I'm one to be eager to see them removed from the grounds, immediately"
25-01-2020T17:47:43,KeefMcDerpface,They didn't pay the rent?
25-01-2020T17:47:43,ProsePro7,How does Rose not know about this thing since she is practically the house
25-01-2020T17:47:57,Roughlandin,"Like I said earlier, this is gearing up to be the most important plot arc so far"
25-01-2020T17:48:01,ShamusTheFox,Rose wasn't told of all Trace's plans.
25-01-2020T17:48:21,Roughlandin,"Also, Trace may have made it so she CAN'T tell anyone"
25-01-2020T17:48:22,InTheLionsDen,Rose had limiters placed on her access.
25-01-2020T17:48:25,CrimsonHelsing,"or see Trace tell them ""look, it's over. give up. we're done, I don't want Saria back anymore!"""
25-01-2020T17:48:32,WereKeidran,"personally, i'm just ready to shoot some cannons at whatever it is that is getting in the way of my favorite ship from sailing"
25-01-2020T17:48:37,tehbear,why would Rose be involved in any of this? She doesnt hold a grudge against anyone... except Euchre
25-01-2020T17:48:44,Roughlandin,"Even if she does know, she might have a magic bind on revealing the secret"
25-01-2020T17:48:48,steelabjur,I see Rose sort of like a program on a computer. Red Writing is the Manor's OS.
25-01-2020T17:49:00,Avolendi,Also wonder just what Rose got access to when Trace removed her restrictions
25-01-2020T17:49:07,Roughlandin,Uh... years of slavery and magical experimentation by Old Trace might have something to do with that
25-01-2020T17:49:18,ShamusTheFox,"Rose and Euchre have something in the works, even if they dislike each other."
25-01-2020T17:49:43,Roughlandin,I don't think Rose has anything to do with Euchre anymore. His plans are his own
25-01-2020T17:49:59,Roughlandin,Also OUCHIE POOR BRUTUS!
25-01-2020T17:50:00,Rolley,Brutus taking that arrow like a boss
25-01-2020T17:50:06,ShamusTheFox,Euchre warned Rose about Trace seeing the secret room.
25-01-2020T17:50:14,ThingsAreMoving,At least that wasn't an arrow to the knee
25-01-2020T17:50:21,ShamusTheFox,So he knows SOMETHING.
25-01-2020T17:50:23,Katfeathers,"Rose would also know ""Maried phase"" Trace"
25-01-2020T17:51:01,ThingsAreMoving,"Brutus is in all ""I'll fuck you up"" mode right now"
25-01-2020T17:51:07,steelabjur,"Rose was very very close to Saria, and is obviously a powerful magic user in her own right, I wouldn't put it past her to have something to do with trying to bring her back."
25-01-2020T17:51:16,Roughlandin,Not like that
25-01-2020T17:51:33,IronHorseComics,her magic's green
25-01-2020T17:51:45,CrimsonQuill,"Well, Married Trace was the one who taught Rose magic."
25-01-2020T17:51:47,IronHorseComics,and that's red magic being used here
25-01-2020T17:52:00,Rolley,Does anyone have a clue who is after Maren other than Tom
25-01-2020T17:52:06,CrimsonQuill,"Or at leat, perfect it."
25-01-2020T17:52:20,Roughlandin,I think she knows enough about magic to not want anything to do with resurrection. Especially because it seems to involve A LOT of black magic
25-01-2020T17:52:34,IronHorseComics,"her aura is still green, I don't think she's directly responsible"
25-01-2020T17:52:43,ProsePro7,I dont think even Tom knows yet
25-01-2020T17:52:44,KeefMcDerpface,And Trace being a prime example of black magic.
25-01-2020T17:52:47,steelabjur,"@Rolley, only that it was something Evil Trace setup a long time ago."
25-01-2020T17:52:49,Mippy,"Dang, just looked up from my Psych homework"
25-01-2020T17:53:09,tehbear,get psyched
25-01-2020T17:53:17,Rolley,I just noticed the dead guy on the floor
25-01-2020T17:53:34,Roughlandin,"*""Steel for Humans"" intensifies*"
25-01-2020T17:53:47,KeefMcDerpface,Bottom right?

25-01-2020T18:45:58,Brocade,I've been cooking the past hour and I absolutely suck. It took me waaaaaay too long to peel these peppers because I didn't roast them long enough

25-01-2020T18:46:17,ThingsAreMoving,"Bro, what are ya cooking?"
25-01-2020T18:46:43,ShamusTheFox,"As Zen cased the home of his next target, he felt his phone go off with a vibrating buzz. It was fortunate that he has remembered to put the phone on silent; on his early jobs he hadn't been so lucky. He opened his phone and saw that Natani was calling."
25-01-2020T18:47:02,KeefMcDerpface,We're still going with this?!
25-01-2020T18:47:13,henner,XD exactly derpface
25-01-2020T18:47:14,Rolley,Is that femkieth

25-01-2020T18:47:34,KeefMcDerpface,"Alright, what weapons would Zen have?"
25-01-2020T18:47:37,Rolley,This can‚Äôt end well
25-01-2020T18:48:26,ShamusTheFox,"""The target has moved! Get out of there! If you're lucky you can get down to the ground floor before they leave the building!"" Zen cursed under his breath and darted back towards the window. It was a daring leap, but he had faith in his safety harness."
25-01-2020T18:48:28,Rolley,Zen should have the little knives he had on the first attack on trace
25-01-2020T18:48:55,henner,zen would have a tactical glock with a silencer and green dot sight
25-01-2020T18:49:05,henner,and a grappling hook
25-01-2020T18:49:18,henner,cant forget the grappling hook
25-01-2020T18:49:36,Mippy,"and a Batmobile, and a rocket, and a chocolate bar and...."

25-01-2020T18:50:06,ShamusTheFox,"Gravity took the wheel as he plunged down, the cords on his harness slowing his descent as they were designed to do. Once he got to street level, he unbuckled the harness and grabbed his knife. He could catch them the moment they exited the building."

25-01-2020T18:50:24,KeefMcDerpface,I'm thinking the collapsible sword from Dishonored.
25-01-2020T18:50:25,CrimsonQuill,Now for the nightmare
25-01-2020T18:50:25,MuonNeutrino,"definitely a suppressed pistol and a knife, honestly 'assassin' doesn't mean heavily armed"
25-01-2020T18:50:37,CrimsonQuill,Here go the gravity hammer pics from Halopedia
25-01-2020T18:50:38,MuonNeutrino,"if you need something stronger than those, you've probably fucked up"
25-01-2020T18:51:09,ThingsAreMoving,...why did I get a notification that Tom has made a stream recording 9 minutes ago
25-01-2020T18:51:41,TeapotOfDoom,nothing can go wrong with the occasional AK47
25-01-2020T18:51:54,MuonNeutrino,too bulky and heavy to carry
25-01-2020T18:51:59,MuonNeutrino,as assassin should be moving light
25-01-2020T18:52:16,ProsePro7,Keith x Fem Keith...takes the whole go f**k yourself thing to another level
25-01-2020T18:52:17,TeapotOfDoom,supressed walther or glock
25-01-2020T18:52:23,henner,"yea, like a full auto 12 gauge shotgun"
25-01-2020T18:52:34,ThingsAreMoving,an assassin should be able to utilise everything he's got in his disposal
25-01-2020T18:52:38,TeapotOfDoom,"gott sei dank mann, gibts ne pumpgun"

25-01-2020T18:52:45,ShamusTheFox,"Zen didn't know who tipped off his target, but they were wild and in a panic, which made it easy. The blow was quick and precise, right at the base of the neck. With the deed done, Zen took off for the nearest alleyway, where he had a change of clothes."

25-01-2020T19:07:50,MuonNeutrino,eric SHOULD be scared of natani
25-01-2020T19:07:58,Rolley,Are there reptile Keidran?
25-01-2020T19:08:04,Roughlandin,eric is soffboi
25-01-2020T19:08:06,MuonNeutrino,and @ShamusTheFox that assumes rose didn't have anything to do with it >.>
25-01-2020T19:08:12,MuonNeutrino,"which is likely, but we don't know for sure"
25-01-2020T19:08:13,ThingsAreMoving,I prefer spicy chicken burritos over chili con carne burritos :ctwokinds-natsducky:
25-01-2020T19:08:21,AtomowyJohny,i am alive only because chocolate exists
25-01-2020T19:08:24,ThingsAreMoving,can't go wrong with chicken
25-01-2020T19:08:42,MuonNeutrino,"@Rolley tom once said that keidran are only canine and feline species. there are apparently lizard species in the TK universe, but they don't count as keidran"
25-01-2020T19:08:47,henner,i dont even know what happened in the latest page
25-01-2020T19:08:51,henner,is it posted?
25-01-2020T19:08:53,ShamusTheFox,"Well, if Rose is in on it, that assumes she was working with Evil Trace, either willingly or unwillingly."
25-01-2020T19:08:55,henner,ma check
25-01-2020T19:08:58,BadFoMo,"@Rolley I think there are reptiles, but I don't think they're Keidran."
25-01-2020T19:09:09,Roughlandin,A new challenger approaches! Pork burrito!
25-01-2020T19:09:13,Rolley,Ok thanks for clarifying
25-01-2020T19:09:20,ShamusTheFox,Could Rose want Saria back that bad?
25-01-2020T19:09:35,henner,the reptile thing was left as a question in the comic
25-01-2020T19:09:46,Roughlandin,"Again, Rose knows enough about black magic to not want anything to do with it"
25-01-2020T19:09:54,MuonNeutrino,that assumes trace gave her a choice
25-01-2020T19:10:00,Mippy,I'm a fan of bean and cheese to be honest
25-01-2020T19:10:02,ThingsAreMoving,"brb, imma get me some black bean noodles"
25-01-2020T19:10:18,Rolley,Mike looks unaffected by Eric‚Äôs suggestion powers
25-01-2020T19:10:27,Twokinds,I'll clean this up later. I'm done
25-01-2020T19:10:31,TeapotOfDoom,"but if rose was forced, the force should have dropped when he lifted her restrictions"
25-01-2020T19:10:32,BadFoMo,Cool.
25-01-2020T19:10:34,Rolley,Ok Tom
25-01-2020T19:10:36,KeefMcDerpface,Ok Tom.
25-01-2020T19:10:36,Mippy,ok
25-01-2020T19:10:36,MuonNeutrino,"if trace decided he wanted rose as part of his plans, then rose is part of his plans whether she wanted to be or not"
25-01-2020T19:10:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,nicely done Tom
25-01-2020T19:10:47,TeapotOfDoom,suggestive/10
25-01-2020T19:10:49,Rolley,Looks good for now
25-01-2020T19:10:51,AspiringNoodle,I'm conflicted over busty Flora :P
25-01-2020T19:11:02,Roughlandin,That it for the stream or just this sketch?
25-01-2020T19:11:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'm not
25-01-2020T19:11:06,Brocade,Flora looks great - I'm not conflicted at all
25-01-2020T19:11:09,AspiringNoodle,Hawt... but flat is justice?!?
25-01-2020T19:11:09,Sclimshady,Nice work Tom
25-01-2020T19:11:13,BadFoMo,The sketch.

25-01-2020T19:11:28,ThingsAreMoving,tasteful lewdness / 10
25-01-2020T19:11:30,henner,yo
25-01-2020T19:11:33,MuonNeutrino,"i half-wonder if there's more than one 'version' of rose now, the one we see that preserves her old personality and another more twisted aspect that trace bound as part of whatever is going on here."
25-01-2020T19:11:36,jirka,Very nice Tom
25-01-2020T19:11:43,MuonNeutrino,"i don't think it's likely, but i'm having a hard time coming up with who else could be the second voice"
25-01-2020T19:11:46,SomeNiceUser,"Might be something E. Trace implimented, when a suitable body is found, Rose is tasked to contain and do what is needed to the body."
25-01-2020T19:11:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Husky!! :eyes:
25-01-2020T19:12:08,henner,ye i just seen it something crazy is going down
25-01-2020T19:12:08,MuonNeutrino,particularly who else would have any *motivation* to help trace resurrect saria
25-01-2020T19:12:13,BaudelaireGaudi,Why polls needs to be logged via patreon?
25-01-2020T19:12:21,MuonNeutrino,@BaudelaireGaudi because people were cheating
25-01-2020T19:12:27,ShamusTheFox,"Muon: I don't think it's the Masks. One of the Masks actively turned on Trace, so I can't see them being involved."
25-01-2020T19:12:29,SomeNiceUser,Something with people rigging the polls.
25-01-2020T19:12:41,MuonNeutrino,yeah i don't think it is either
25-01-2020T19:13:09,BaudelaireGaudi,"What's about people, who can't log in, because country retrictions?"
25-01-2020T19:13:20,Roughlandin,VPN
25-01-2020T19:13:22,Rolley,Duuuuude I need the sythe ref sheet
25-01-2020T19:13:32,unsteddyphoenix,What countries restrict it?
25-01-2020T19:13:40,ShamusTheFox,I have a soft suspicion it's something like the stone guardian.
25-01-2020T19:13:44,BaudelaireGaudi,"Poland, because Patronite."
25-01-2020T19:13:45,Roughlandin,China prolly
25-01-2020T19:14:07,BadFoMo,Got mine in order.
25-01-2020T19:14:08,henner,mabye traces wife was secretly evil and part of the templar the whole time
25-01-2020T19:14:12,Roughlandin,Poland. Witcher okay. Furries no-kay
25-01-2020T19:14:14,ShamusTheFox,An A.I. that Trace created with parameters to handle Maren.
25-01-2020T19:14:25,ThingsAreMoving,if you can't log in to patreon through tkpolls you can't log in to it normally and therefore you can't support 10$ for the suggestions and voting power
25-01-2020T19:14:43,Roughlandin,"Also, henner SHUT YOUR MOUTH SARIA WAS PERFECT AND BLAMELESS TAKE IT BACK ASDHSDK"
25-01-2020T19:15:10,henner,"you never know, anyone could be hiding anything"
25-01-2020T19:15:24,KeefMcDerpface,Saria disliked the Templar so uh no?
25-01-2020T19:15:26,Rolley,Between the red sheet and Tom getting cared for by the TK cast
25-01-2020T19:15:33,ThingsAreMoving,"Baudelaire, can confirm Patreon is indeed accessible from Poland."
25-01-2020T19:15:33,Rolley,Ref*

25-01-2020T19:15:46,SomeNiceUser,Rose is basically a CPU within the pc.

25-01-2020T19:16:30,ShamusTheFox,"Aside from that, I think there may be something with Mrs. Nibbly. She has been with team B for a while, and the squirrel hid from the dragon. Also, it was able to cross the threshold without permission. Though that could be a technicality."

25-01-2020T19:16:56,SomeNiceUser,Mrs. Nibbly might be a familliar.
25-01-2020T19:16:59,Roughlandin,I think she'll come into play soon but I doubt Nibs is behind anything
25-01-2020T19:17:05,CrimsonQuill,Tom? May I have permission to post a link?>

25-01-2020T19:23:32,TeapotOfDoom,bye anu
25-01-2020T19:23:35,PalmettoPathfinder1,Although I think the ones where the TK characters try to tend to a sick Tom would have been funny.  :D

25-01-2020T19:23:47,Rolley,Bye Anu
25-01-2020T19:23:57,BaudelaireGaudi,Maybe because I don't have a good hand and have Surface Pro :/
25-01-2020T19:24:01,Sclimshady,See ya Anu o/
25-01-2020T19:24:12,ShamusTheFox,"Legit, I am hoping at some point in the comic, the Basitins make a statue of Laura to commemorate her sacrifice."
25-01-2020T19:24:17,Roughlandin,Or Tom's been arting for over a decade? Be patient with yourself
25-01-2020T19:24:23,CrimsonQuill,I just use pencil and paper
25-01-2020T19:24:23,TeapotOfDoom,line confidence is something that needs practise
25-01-2020T19:24:25,CrimsonQuill,it takes time
25-01-2020T19:24:26,ThingsAreMoving,o/ Anu
25-01-2020T19:24:33,TeapotOfDoom,a lot actually
25-01-2020T19:24:41,CrRAR,It‚Äôll be a staute of a potato sack shamus
25-01-2020T19:24:51,CrimsonQuill,It took me a LONG time to even draw a table properly
25-01-2020T19:24:52,KeefMcDerpface,lol
25-01-2020T19:25:00,WINDOWS98SE,Could maybe use a potato sack as the base.
25-01-2020T19:25:04,TeapotOfDoom,paper is actually easier to learn then screen. because screen slippery
25-01-2020T19:25:15,BadFoMo,@Roughlandin Nude is just nude to me. Clothing... I think the word could be 'inhances' the body.
25-01-2020T19:25:20,ShamusTheFox,"Hah! Well, potato sack with Laura's name on it would work, I suppose?"
25-01-2020T19:25:32,BaudelaireGaudi,My straight lines looks like ECG.
25-01-2020T19:25:34,BadFoMo,"A little late, I know."
25-01-2020T19:25:48,TeapotOfDoom,there are exercises btw
25-01-2020T19:26:00,KeefMcDerpface,But do they have ankle wrappings?
25-01-2020T19:26:06,TeapotOfDoom,search for line conidence on youtube or something
25-01-2020T19:26:16,TeapotOfDoom,*confidence
25-01-2020T19:26:16,Roughlandin,@BadFoMo Idk I've seen nude and nude is pretty cool. Clothes are cool too lol
25-01-2020T19:26:16,KeefMcDerpface,While wearing the skimpy.

25-01-2020T22:02:18,ElvenHunter84,Make sure he brings hand sanitizer to his next con
25-01-2020T22:02:41,InTheLionsDen,Go to more cons and build up an immunity.
25-01-2020T22:06:05,ThingsAreMoving,Infect other people with viruses you're immune to
25-01-2020T22:09:19,CrRAR,:tangerine:
25-01-2020T22:09:45,Twokinds,I wouldn't wish this sickness on anyone.
25-01-2020T22:09:57,Twokinds,"It didn't last very long, but it was intense."
25-01-2020T22:10:02,ElvenHunter84,You were really bedridden for a few days?
25-01-2020T22:10:19,CrRAR,"yeah, same what I heard from folks around"
25-01-2020T22:10:22,ThingsAreMoving,But that's how people build immunity.
25-01-2020T22:10:37,Twokinds,It was only at its worst for about a day. It hurt to get out of bed.
25-01-2020T22:10:40,CrRAR,flash mob flu
25-01-2020T22:10:53,Ordithus,"ick, glad you're feeling better"
25-01-2020T22:10:54,CrRAR,"yeah, suks"
25-01-2020T22:11:39,ThingsAreMoving,You should be good for a good while now. You're immune.
25-01-2020T22:12:03,SpazztasticKiwi,good to know we‚Äôre back in the swing of things
25-01-2020T22:12:16,SpazztasticKiwi,or at least inching to it
25-01-2020T22:12:23,ElvenHunter84,"but for real, make sure you wash your hands often whenever you go to cons"
25-01-2020T22:12:36,ElvenHunter84,otherwise you will most likely get at least a little sick
25-01-2020T22:12:41,SpazztasticKiwi,sleep is most important in travel
25-01-2020T22:12:52,SpazztasticKiwi,immune system needs rest
25-01-2020T22:12:58,ThingsAreMoving,Isn't washing hands like... the most basic hygiene?
25-01-2020T22:13:11,InTheLionsDen,Not just for cons
25-01-2020T22:13:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I highly doubt he was chewing on his fingers like a toddler anyhow
25-01-2020T22:13:29,Human72,is two kinds done for the night?
25-01-2020T22:13:31,ElvenHunter84,"Sometimes if you are at a con, people go for several hours without stopping to go to the bathroom"
25-01-2020T22:14:13,ThingsAreMoving,That's... nasty tbh
25-01-2020T22:14:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"& crrar, that equinox"
25-01-2020T22:14:30,SpazztasticKiwi,no response
25-01-2020T22:14:45,SpazztasticKiwi,so I don‚Äôt suppose she‚Äôs selling
25-01-2020T22:15:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"you want nasty - I know people go to cons and never wash their hands between bathroom, maybe scratching their face, and eating"
25-01-2020T22:16:16,Ordithus,ew
25-01-2020T22:16:25,ThingsAreMoving,"If we ever meet, don't introduce me to them, plzkthx"
25-01-2020T22:17:06,SpazztasticKiwi,they exist
25-01-2020T22:17:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"you can spot em people watching but as even for life in general, keep your hands away from your face"
25-01-2020T22:18:22,KeefMcDerpface,And that's why you have a small bottle of hand sanitizer.
25-01-2020T22:18:25,SpazztasticKiwi,v important for conventions and meetings
25-01-2020T22:20:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"the song is wrong, you do not get down with the sickness"
25-01-2020T22:20:33,ElvenHunter84,Ooh ah ah ah ah
25-01-2020T22:20:40,SpazztasticKiwi,no no
25-01-2020T22:20:41,SpazztasticKiwi,bad
25-01-2020T22:21:20,ElvenHunter84,"on a different subject, I think I'm going to change my sketch for February"
25-01-2020T22:21:51,ElvenHunter84,I planned to suggest a sequel to a sketch that got drawn tonight back when I first saw it be suggest
25-01-2020T22:21:55,ElvenHunter84,-ed
25-01-2020T22:22:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I kinda have an idea for February but nat & Keith don‚Äôt sit well as wine drinkers
25-01-2020T22:22:57,ThingsAreMoving,I'll keep suggesting Maren until she gets picked up.
25-01-2020T22:23:14,Ordithus,eee Maren <3
25-01-2020T22:23:22,ElvenHunter84,which Maren one?
25-01-2020T22:23:34,ElvenHunter84,"Maren getting abducted by a table, cause that one just got drawn"
25-01-2020T22:23:38,ThingsAreMoving,cosplay
25-01-2020T22:24:04,SpazztasticKiwi,it was nice to see a baby Nibbly got one whole vote
25-01-2020T22:24:12,ElvenHunter84,the Carmen Sandiego one?
25-01-2020T22:24:13,Ordithus,Mike's scar backstory didn't do as well this week
25-01-2020T22:24:22,ElvenHunter84,does he have a scar?
25-01-2020T22:24:24,ThingsAreMoving,"yep, Elven"
25-01-2020T22:24:27,Ordithus,On his face
25-01-2020T22:24:35,ElvenHunter84,I always thought that was a wierd line from how Tom used to face his art
25-01-2020T22:24:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I was benching on the awww overload but
25-01-2020T22:24:49,ElvenHunter84,"like, there are instances where it isnt there"
25-01-2020T22:24:52,ThingsAreMoving,Also I was hoping for Raine shouting at Mary and Euchre. That honestly seemed like a genuine good idea
25-01-2020T22:24:57,Ordithus,He sometimes forgets
25-01-2020T22:25:02,Ordithus,https://www.deviantart.com/twokinds/art/Test-of-Resolve-818741480
25-01-2020T22:25:19,Twokinds,"Gotta be honest, that suggestion makes me nervous. Cause I don't have a good story for why he has that scar."
25-01-2020T22:25:23,Ordithus,Also I don't think fem-Mike ever does
25-01-2020T22:25:37,SpazztasticKiwi,make it stupid
25-01-2020T22:25:37,ThingsAreMoving,Not every story has to be good
25-01-2020T22:25:47,ThingsAreMoving,Some scars are mundane
25-01-2020T22:25:54,ElvenHunter84,He accidentally walked into a glass door and cut his face
25-01-2020T22:26:11,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI was fighting off a stowaway on Eric‚Äôs boat years ago. It was rough but I escaped victorious‚Äù
25-01-2020T22:26:25,Ordithus,His story might be more impressive than the real story
25-01-2020T22:26:35,ThingsAreMoving,He got hit by a cracked bottle during a tavern fight
25-01-2020T22:26:36,ElvenHunter84,and Evals outs him
25-01-2020T22:26:48,ElvenHunter84,"like ""Dude, that's not what happened at all"""
25-01-2020T22:26:52,SpazztasticKiwi,and eves walks in like ‚ÄúYou knocked yourself cutting a frozen bagel with a steak knife‚Äù
25-01-2020T22:26:57,ThingsAreMoving,xD
25-01-2020T22:27:01,SpazztasticKiwi,knicked
25-01-2020T22:27:14,Ordithus,A tragic dishwashing accident
25-01-2020T22:27:15,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúshut up‚Äù
25-01-2020T22:27:19,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI will not‚Äù
25-01-2020T22:27:25,Ordithus,He got in a knife fight!
25-01-2020T22:27:36,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:*[The knife won]
25-01-2020T22:28:03,ElvenHunter84,There's also that Beastars suggestion
25-01-2020T22:28:14,ElvenHunter84,"Has Tom watched Beastars, cause I doubt he'll draw that otherwise"
25-01-2020T22:28:18,SpazztasticKiwi,fun fact - the only reason I have that scenario is because Mark admitted to doing it to himself
25-01-2020T22:28:49,steelabjur,"Could always say Mike's former owner did it and Eric saw it and bought him to save him from the abuse. If there's anyone in this story who could use more brownie points, it's Eric."
25-01-2020T22:29:11,ElvenHunter84,"oh yeah, we dont know anything about Mike's former owner, do we?"
25-01-2020T22:29:30,InTheLionsDen,Was it in the child Mike & Evals drawing?
25-01-2020T22:29:38,Ordithus,They were just in cages in that
25-01-2020T22:29:54,Ordithus,Two good boys... for sale :ctwokinds-LauraCry:
25-01-2020T22:30:18,ElvenHunter84,We only know that Mike was born into slavery and Evals was captured
25-01-2020T22:30:20,steelabjur,"Would also explain why Eric, with his... preferences... owns two male Keidran."
25-01-2020T22:30:23,ElvenHunter84,and then very rudely named
25-01-2020T22:31:38,SpazztasticKiwi,better story: mikes scar is from walking into the sail post on the boat because he saw a pretty fox girl sunbathing
25-01-2020T22:31:58,Ordithus,Real
25-01-2020T22:32:58,SpazztasticKiwi,this would also explain why he looks anywhere else when faced with a female
25-01-2020T22:33:04,ElvenHunter84,"My suggestion did decently this week, but I'm still banking on a Tom pick for that one since I feel there arent enough Voters on Tkpolls"
25-01-2020T22:33:31,ThingsAreMoving,"The scar is actually from fighting sharks when trying to rescue a fox girl from drowning, only realising she was a fox merfolk all along!"
25-01-2020T22:33:33,Ordithus,If it stumps you I can come up with other ideas though
25-01-2020T22:34:17,Ordithus,A revisit to sultry Trace? :ctwokinds-traceflohug:
25-01-2020T22:34:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I can imagine Tom furiously scribbling notes rn
25-01-2020T22:35:00,ElvenHunter84,I expected a lot more Northern Basitin suggestions this week after that Fluffy Keith sketch
25-01-2020T22:35:19,ThingsAreMoving,"Nothing he couldn't think of, given time, I'd wager."
25-01-2020T22:35:20,SpazztasticKiwi,what about Trace Fabio with long hair
25-01-2020T22:35:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Flora in the bg like ‚Äú????‚Äù
25-01-2020T22:41:24,DarthRexKing,Ni ni.

25-01-2020T22:53:57,Ordithus,Poor guy
25-01-2020T22:54:19,Twokinds,lol
25-01-2020T22:54:26,Twokinds,I did consider having it be something silly like that.
25-01-2020T22:54:39,ElvenHunter84,that must have been one heavy book
25-01-2020T22:54:43,QuinnMalachite,"Just because it has a story, doesn't mean it's an interesting story"
25-01-2020T22:57:48,Twokinds,I think I have some ideas now

25-01-2020T22:58:24,Ordithus,Now I have to keep suggesting it :ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
25-01-2020T23:00:32,QuinnMalachite,"I claim fault, if not responsibility"
25-01-2020T23:01:59,ElvenHunter84,does anybody have a link to that master gallery of like everything Tom has ever drawn?
25-01-2020T23:03:15,Ordithus,https://twokinds.gallery/gallery.jsp
25-01-2020T23:04:01,ElvenHunter84,thanks
25-01-2020T23:04:07,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rainehappy:
25-01-2020T23:04:56,Twokinds,That gallery is really useful
25-01-2020T23:05:05,ElvenHunter84,"hmm, it's not here"
25-01-2020T23:05:39,Twokinds,I need to remember to put up a link to it on my patreon.
25-01-2020T23:05:52,Twokinds,I actually use it a lot to look up sketches I've done in the past.
25-01-2020T23:06:19,ElvenHunter84,"I was looking for the one drawing of Older keith where he is saying ""Trace, is that you? It's been years..."""
25-01-2020T23:06:26,Ordithus,It's really good.  Patreon is sooo bad for looking up anything
25-01-2020T23:06:51,Twokinds,Oh that? I don't think I even ever posted that anywhere.
25-01-2020T23:06:57,steelabjur,Cool. I never saw this gallery before!
25-01-2020T23:07:10,Twokinds,Patreon doesn't have tag cross referencing.
25-01-2020T23:07:14,Twokinds,Which is a shame.
25-01-2020T23:07:42,Twokinds,twokinds.gallery lets you search for multiple tags at once with the + signs.
25-01-2020T23:10:02,ElvenHunter84,I was looking for that picture because I'm suggesting the Older Keith sketch as of now and I wanted to see how much the design would change if it does end up getting sketched.
25-01-2020T23:13:01,AspiringNoodle,Sittin' Pretty makes me think...
