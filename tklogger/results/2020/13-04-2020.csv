13-04-2020T00:55:12,Stormagedon,"Ok, What does the frying pan do, I have never done that"

13-04-2020T00:56:07,maku450,maybe I was wrong
13-04-2020T00:56:27,Stormagedon,I personally like the long sword or the cutlass
13-04-2020T00:56:51,Stormagedon,"Oooooo, Botania is in there? Swwet"
13-04-2020T00:57:16,Kameloh,yeah it's a nice modpack!
13-04-2020T00:57:25,Stormagedon,"Kameloh, I dare you to spam W"

13-04-2020T00:58:30,Kameloh,"not sure, Enigmatica 2: Expert is the modpack though"

13-04-2020T00:59:58,UltraBondageFairy,I'm trying to figure out what I could place for that time
13-04-2020T01:00:16,Stormagedon,what natural features did you have
13-04-2020T01:01:07,UltraBondageFairy,"I can't remember, it was so long ago"
13-04-2020T01:01:11,maku450,mc classic? You mean the web version?
13-04-2020T01:01:15,Kameloh,how long did you guys play it?
13-04-2020T01:01:26,Stormagedon,I still play it
13-04-2020T01:01:30,UltraBondageFairy,"I remember the first time I played it, I think it was a web version"
13-04-2020T01:01:53,maku450,the web version was the first I played
13-04-2020T01:02:11,maku450,I first bought it just before the halloween update when they added the nether
13-04-2020T01:02:13,BadFoMo,Same. It's glitchy for me now.
13-04-2020T01:02:15,Stormagedon,download the MC 10th anniversary map. It goes through all the updates and what they added
13-04-2020T01:03:02,UltraBondageFairy,I think it's entirely possible I played it sometime in 2009
13-04-2020T01:03:07,Stormagedon,I had the snowy tiga as my first world
13-04-2020T01:03:08,UltraBondageFairy,which I think makes sense
13-04-2020T01:03:38,UltraBondageFairy,"I remember going to a friend's house and telling them how great and new chrome was, and talking about minecraft"
13-04-2020T01:03:50,maku450,I first found it from vgcats

13-04-2020T01:05:29,UltraBondageFairy,I remember seeing a screenshot of a skeleton in a minecart
13-04-2020T01:05:33,UltraBondageFairy,as a teaser

13-04-2020T11:58:50,CrimsonQuill,Good evening CrRAR
13-04-2020T11:59:18,CrimsonQuill,"What time did yesterday's stream start, perchance?"
13-04-2020T12:17:18,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
13-04-2020T12:17:40,CrimsonQuill,Hey there Terrra
13-04-2020T12:19:31,TerraTheWizard,'lo
13-04-2020T12:19:58,TerraTheWizard,stream was at like 1:30am our time
13-04-2020T12:20:21,CrimsonQuill,I see thanks
13-04-2020T12:38:14,KeefMcDerpface,"Speaking of last nights stream, I think the sketch with Human Nora and Reni is the first time we saw Nora more human."
13-04-2020T12:38:23,CrimsonQuill,???
13-04-2020T12:38:44,KeefMcDerpface,She didn't have her claws and wings that she had in previous sketches.
13-04-2020T12:39:08,KeefMcDerpface,Unless Tom is adding them at a later date.
13-04-2020T12:39:09,CrimsonQuill,What sketch was it?
13-04-2020T12:39:33,TerraTheWizard,looked like she did have claws
13-04-2020T12:41:05,TerraTheWizard,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/316051421105618944/699535297918140465/unknown.png
13-04-2020T12:42:53,CrimsonQuill,"Ah, I see"
13-04-2020T12:43:04,CrimsonQuill,I like Reni's contrast to Nora
13-04-2020T12:43:33,CrimsonQuill,Much more modest and shy in opposition to Nora's flirtatious fancies

13-04-2020T13:15:00,CrimsonQuill,BOOP
13-04-2020T13:24:35,AspiringNoodle,"That reminds me, need to watch these videos mocking Patreon"
13-04-2020T13:25:12,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-ohmy: that dialogue!
13-04-2020T13:26:04,AspiringNoodle,"Also, awwwwww, even though she's a durg, she's embarassed about chest talk~"
13-04-2020T13:27:02,CrimsonQuill,Videos?
13-04-2020T13:28:07,AspiringNoodle,Apparently Patreon sent out some VERY tone deaf emails / notices to creators
13-04-2020T13:28:24,CrimsonQuill,...Ah.
13-04-2020T13:28:27,AspiringNoodle,"I'll learn the specifics eventually, but apparently they're broke / going broke"
13-04-2020T13:28:38,CrimsonQuill,Patreon?
13-04-2020T13:29:00,AspiringNoodle,"Which is hilarious since they see fit to ban just about all ""degenerate"" (my words, not theirs) content"
13-04-2020T13:29:07,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, here's the sad truth"
13-04-2020T13:29:27,CrimsonQuill,By 'Degenerate'...
13-04-2020T13:29:30,AspiringNoodle,"Patreon basically does NOTHING professionally.  They set up the service, they ""moderate"" content"
13-04-2020T13:29:53,AspiringNoodle,"But their whole business model is let other people do all the work, then skim money off the top (I think it's like 5%?)"
13-04-2020T13:30:19,CrimsonQuill,...And what about them going broke?
13-04-2020T13:30:22,AspiringNoodle,"Yes, Quill.  Porn, risque content, anime"
13-04-2020T13:30:33,CrimsonQuill,I can understand the banning of the porn
13-04-2020T13:30:39,CrimsonQuill,Because I cannot abide by that
13-04-2020T13:30:57,CrimsonQuill,I don't know how 'risque' something'd be before banning
13-04-2020T13:31:10,CrimsonQuill,"But i'd say that Tom's stuff is safe, as it's pretty tame"
13-04-2020T13:31:21,AspiringNoodle,"Uh, some of the more culturally taboo stuff they outright forbid"
13-04-2020T13:31:22,CrimsonQuill,As for anime in general... CONFUSION
13-04-2020T13:31:40,CrimsonQuill,"Culturally Taboo? As in, scared of someone being offended?"
13-04-2020T13:31:45,AspiringNoodle,Patreon is considering stuff drawn in an anime style to be lolicon / shotacon style stuff
13-04-2020T13:31:58,CrimsonQuill,...no idea what that means...
13-04-2020T13:32:16,AspiringNoodle,"So you could have someone clearly be of age, but because they're drawn in an anime style, they'll consider it ""kiddie"" stuff"
13-04-2020T13:32:34,AspiringNoodle,Because super cartoony style / look younger than they actually are and all that bs
13-04-2020T13:32:38,CrimsonQuill,Oh. Horse malarck
13-04-2020T13:32:46,CrimsonQuill,That is just baloney
13-04-2020T13:32:46,AspiringNoodle,"So yeah, about Tom being safe?  Not so sure"
13-04-2020T13:33:02,AspiringNoodle,His style is heavily derived from anime / manga
13-04-2020T13:33:05,CrimsonQuill,'Animation Age ghetto'-I blame that
13-04-2020T13:33:29,AspiringNoodle,"At some point, they could just arbitrarily say, ""Hey, your stuff violates our arbitrary and constantly changing ToS, either change it or get lost"""
13-04-2020T13:34:08,CrimsonQuill,And here I was thinking Patreon is actually a better place than most
13-04-2020T13:34:50,AspiringNoodle,"But yeah, these videos should be entertaining"
13-04-2020T13:35:40,AspiringNoodle,"Essentially, Patreon is acting as the gatekeeper / censor"
13-04-2020T13:35:55,CrimsonQuill,I see.
13-04-2020T13:35:57,AspiringNoodle,"But because they're not making enough money, they're desperate"
13-04-2020T13:36:37,AspiringNoodle,But at the same time it's their own damn fault.
13-04-2020T13:37:54,CrimsonQuill,Ah.
13-04-2020T13:37:59,CrimsonQuill,Well.
13-04-2020T13:38:16,CrimsonQuill,I see.
13-04-2020T13:38:20,AspiringNoodle,"It's funny because this is happening at the same time as the mainstream comics industry is officially dead, ahahaha"
13-04-2020T13:38:42,CrimsonQuill,We are cursed with interesting times...
13-04-2020T13:39:13,AspiringNoodle,"We are in an age where people purposefully shoot themselves in the foot, and then beg for help because they chose to shoot themselves in the foot"
13-04-2020T13:40:07,AspiringNoodle,"The industry thing has been a long time coming, though."
13-04-2020T13:40:09,CrimsonQuill,...I thought that was every age though
13-04-2020T13:40:20,CrimsonQuill,Haven't people always been like that?
13-04-2020T13:40:21,AspiringNoodle,"Patreon is more of a ""Wait, really??"" deal"
13-04-2020T13:40:44,AspiringNoodle,"Also, when I say ""people"", I mean ""corporations"".  Because, you know, that fun little legal fact :P"
13-04-2020T13:41:06,CrimsonQuill,"I mean, technically, I shot myself in the foot last year by not going out and meeting people leading to a deep state of personal darkness culminating in a full on isolation-induced breakdown"
13-04-2020T13:41:27,CrimsonQuill,So we ourselves are not immune to it
13-04-2020T13:41:34,AspiringNoodle,That's COMPLETELY different
13-04-2020T13:41:45,AspiringNoodle,And totally worthy of a hug *hug*
13-04-2020T13:41:56,CrimsonQuill,I shot myself in the foot by doing my bit of studies but then driving it all out of my head in my free time playing SKYRIM of all things
13-04-2020T13:42:01,CrimsonQuill,...thanks for the hug...
13-04-2020T13:42:31,AspiringNoodle,"I'm talking about corporations adopting political ideology, flipping customers the bid while also saying, ""We don't need you anymore."""
13-04-2020T13:42:45,AspiringNoodle,"And then come crawling to those customers on their knees, begging for them to come back and give them money"
13-04-2020T13:42:54,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, that stuff."
13-04-2020T13:43:00,CrimsonQuill,"Well, we talk about that so much now.."
13-04-2020T13:43:08,CrimsonQuill,I just can't deal with it anymore..
13-04-2020T13:43:16,AspiringNoodle,Just remember
13-04-2020T13:43:39,AspiringNoodle,"If Tom's patreon gets shut down because of his style (and his SUPER fan-service-y content), I warned you"
13-04-2020T13:43:55,CrimsonQuill,I hope to God it doesn't.
13-04-2020T13:44:03,CrimsonQuill,Because his stuff is actually decent.
13-04-2020T13:44:10,AspiringNoodle,"Well, I have a quote for you"
13-04-2020T13:44:15,CrimsonQuill,"Moderately saucy in some spots, I admit"
13-04-2020T13:44:30,CrimsonQuill,"But I generally prefer cute, heartwarming, awesome and wholesome anyhow"
13-04-2020T13:45:00,AspiringNoodle,"First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—"
13-04-2020T13:45:03,AspiringNoodle,Because I was not a socialist.
13-04-2020T13:45:08,AspiringNoodle,"Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—"
13-04-2020T13:45:11,AspiringNoodle,Because I was not a trade unionist.
13-04-2020T13:45:16,AspiringNoodle,"Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—"
13-04-2020T13:45:18,CrimsonQuill,-Because I was not a Jew
13-04-2020T13:45:23,CrimsonQuill,-Then they came for me.
13-04-2020T13:45:33,CrimsonQuill,-And there was no one left to speak out for me.
13-04-2020T13:45:37,CrimsonQuill,...
13-04-2020T13:45:42,AspiringNoodle,You see my point?
13-04-2020T13:45:46,CrimsonQuill,...
13-04-2020T13:45:49,CrimsonQuill,I want to speak out
13-04-2020T13:45:51,CrimsonQuill,But at the same time
13-04-2020T13:45:58,CrimsonQuill,I want to get my job
13-04-2020T13:46:11,CrimsonQuill,And make sure that i actually have a foundation to stand on
13-04-2020T13:46:24,CrimsonQuill,"And that if I speak out, I will cause more problems than solutions..."
13-04-2020T13:46:30,CrimsonQuill,Because if I were to speak out.
13-04-2020T13:46:39,CrimsonQuill,The bastards at the top would change one thing here and there
13-04-2020T13:46:48,CrimsonQuill,"But nothing changes really, does it?"
13-04-2020T13:46:57,AspiringNoodle,i'm just giving you a heads up with regards to Patreon
13-04-2020T13:47:00,CrimsonQuill,'Shoot the dictator and prevent the war?'
13-04-2020T13:47:18,AspiringNoodle,They're already restricting / banning certain types of content
13-04-2020T13:47:21,CrimsonQuill,'But the dictator is merely the tip of the festering pus from which dictators emerge.
13-04-2020T13:47:43,CrimsonQuill,"Shoot him, and another will take his place. Shoot him too? Why not shoot everyone and invade Poland?'"
13-04-2020T13:47:51,AspiringNoodle,"And the people who enjoy that content are fighting against it, but if other people are like, ""Be quiet, I agree with Patreon on this.""  Then Patreon goes through with it and moves on to the next thing"
13-04-2020T13:47:53,CrimsonQuill,'History always carries a great weight of Inertia'
13-04-2020T13:47:59,CrimsonQuill,...
13-04-2020T13:48:09,CrimsonQuill,There are some things I agree with and some I don't.
13-04-2020T13:48:18,AspiringNoodle,"And eventually they WILL come for the content you like, and you could've had allies"
13-04-2020T13:48:24,CrimsonQuill,...
13-04-2020T13:48:32,CrimsonQuill,That may be...
13-04-2020T13:48:47,CrimsonQuill,"But there are some things that should be curbed, because i know the damage they do first hand."
13-04-2020T13:49:02,CrimsonQuill,Physically and emotionally.
13-04-2020T13:49:33,CrimsonQuill,And if worst comes to worst.
13-04-2020T13:49:42,CrimsonQuill,I know how to join the group in protests
13-04-2020T13:49:46,AspiringNoodle,But there are times when you need to do the opposite of what seems the right thing.  Chinese finger trap in a nutshell.
13-04-2020T13:49:53,CrimsonQuill,...
13-04-2020T13:50:15,AspiringNoodle,I'd actually like to point out a country that tried something RADICALLY different when it comes to drug enforcement
13-04-2020T13:50:45,AspiringNoodle,Portugal back in 2001 legalized ALL drugs.
13-04-2020T13:50:56,CrimsonQuill,Under heavy regulation?
13-04-2020T13:51:06,AspiringNoodle,"Since then, the country has seen a massive decrease in both drug use and drug crime"
13-04-2020T13:51:29,AspiringNoodle,"Why?  By removing the stigma associated with its use, people were more open to seeking help"
13-04-2020T13:52:05,CrimsonQuill,...I did read an essay about that...
13-04-2020T13:52:09,AspiringNoodle,It's also like how the prohibition backfired spectacularly and lead to the rise of organized crime
13-04-2020T13:52:15,ThoseButterflys,I was re reading the twokinds comic and why is there a penguin
13-04-2020T13:52:21,AspiringNoodle,What page?
13-04-2020T13:52:33,ThoseButterflys,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/101/
13-04-2020T13:52:47,AspiringNoodle,"Meh, younger tom"
13-04-2020T13:53:10,AspiringNoodle,It wasn't until the Basitin Isles arc that he really stepped into his storytelling stride
13-04-2020T13:53:44,AspiringNoodle,"Early comic has lots of little details that are there for comedic effect, world building (sometimes later forgotten), or just to be interesting."
13-04-2020T13:54:06,ThoseButterflys,so tom is in his 30s
13-04-2020T13:54:28,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, but those pages were made when he was 16 or so"
13-04-2020T13:54:46,ThoseButterflys,ok I was just wondering
13-04-2020T13:54:56,AspiringNoodle,"yeah, this comic's been running for 16+ years"
13-04-2020T13:55:20,CrimsonQuill,Heck
13-04-2020T13:55:28,CrimsonQuill,The first 9 chapters
13-04-2020T13:55:34,CrimsonQuill,Were all done in 2 years
13-04-2020T13:55:34,ThoseButterflys,I know but rereading I find things I didnt find first time
13-04-2020T13:55:38,CrimsonQuill,Well
13-04-2020T13:55:43,CrimsonQuill,When Tom Started
13-04-2020T13:55:57,CrimsonQuill,It's easy to see he was still figuring out what sort of story he was trying to tell
13-04-2020T13:56:10,AspiringNoodle,"Also, he was pumping out 3 pages a week xD"
13-04-2020T13:56:13,CrimsonQuill,"But starting with chapter 7, his skill started to shoot up"
13-04-2020T13:56:13,xcvb,that penguin is PenPen from early Yosh
13-04-2020T13:56:18,CrimsonQuill,I remember that
13-04-2020T13:56:24,AspiringNoodle,"Eventually that staggered down to 2, and now 1"
13-04-2020T13:56:38,CrimsonQuill,But the quality is unquestionable.
13-04-2020T13:56:41,AspiringNoodle,^
13-04-2020T13:56:41,ThoseButterflys,ok look lik I need to red a few other comics
13-04-2020T13:56:47,AspiringNoodle,"Also, huge amounts of work for patrons"
13-04-2020T13:57:09,CrimsonQuill,"Heck, even as of chapter 10, the quality of writing was so much more than before"
13-04-2020T13:57:28,CrimsonQuill,"And one of my favourite quotes is in the chapter before, chapter 9."
13-04-2020T13:58:13,CrimsonQuill,"When Trace asks Keith for help about Flora and what to say about Marriage...but takes his words a bit too far, and implies that Flora being a Keidran is a barrier..."
13-04-2020T13:58:30,CrimsonQuill,At which Keith slams him against the wall to knock some sense into him
13-04-2020T13:58:54,CrimsonQuill,One of the best things about giving Keith a British accent like mine is that I can really FEEL the line when he says it...
13-04-2020T13:59:21,CrimsonQuill,"""What makes you any less animal than us? What makes you humans so high and mighty?!"""
13-04-2020T14:00:02,CrimsonQuill,"Oooh, the VENOM he has when he says that line...the betrayal of compassion, the fury at prejudices, concern for friends..."
13-04-2020T14:00:17,CrimsonQuill,I wish I was that outspoken when push came to shove...
13-04-2020T14:00:21,CrimsonQuill,...
13-04-2020T14:00:22,CrimsonQuill,...
13-04-2020T14:00:25,CrimsonQuill,Sorry.
13-04-2020T14:00:30,CrimsonQuill,I got carried away...
13-04-2020T14:00:56,ThoseButterflys,its fine I wa wanting to hear your favorite quote
13-04-2020T14:01:05,ThoseButterflys,*was*
13-04-2020T14:01:27,CrimsonQuill,It's one of my...MANY favourites...
13-04-2020T14:01:46,AspiringNoodle,I swear I made a joke way back when
13-04-2020T14:01:53,ThoseButterflys,ohh sorry many favorites
13-04-2020T14:01:59,AspiringNoodle,"If I ever made a comic, there'd be soooooooooo much death xD"
13-04-2020T14:02:05,CrimsonQuill,"Heck, Keith's Speech about the Law at his trial is the TV tropes quote for 'Lawful Stupid' ...at least it was before I stopped looking at TV Tropes."
13-04-2020T14:02:21,CrimsonQuill,One of the things I like about Hunters of Salamanstra is how DIFFERENT it is in tone
13-04-2020T14:02:36,CrimsonQuill,"I love Twokinds and its tone, and I love Salamanstra and its tone"
13-04-2020T14:02:53,CrimsonQuill,"Twokinds is very hopeful, despite the setting being VERY dark when you peel at it."
13-04-2020T14:03:12,CrimsonQuill,But Hunters of Salamanstra is IN YOUR FACE with how bleak it is...
13-04-2020T14:03:22,CrimsonQuill,Different tones for Different stories
13-04-2020T14:03:42,ThoseButterflys,huh I guess I will have to read that

13-04-2020T21:32:50,swedishkitsune,I only have one HDMI and one display out on the comp
13-04-2020T21:32:58,Sclimshady,HDMI and a display port
13-04-2020T21:33:18,swedishkitsune,I fucked up when choosing motherboard
13-04-2020T21:33:36,Sclimshady,Why?
13-04-2020T21:33:39,Ordithus,install a cheap video card?
13-04-2020T21:33:51,Sclimshady,Shouldnt it be connected to the gpu?

13-04-2020T21:36:42,swedishkitsune,did the pinata idea go through?
13-04-2020T21:37:57,swedishkitsune,"ok, I saw wrong. I have 4 display ports and 1 HDMI"
13-04-2020T21:38:11,Ordithus,should be plenty

13-04-2020T21:39:02,Zapheth,hdmi to display port converters are fairly cheap

13-04-2020T21:39:32,swedishkitsune,same with my monitor now also
13-04-2020T21:39:42,Kameloh,:thinking:
13-04-2020T21:39:49,Kameloh,or should the trap be like a rope trap

13-04-2020T21:40:25,swedishkitsune,digging a pit seems way too forward planning for a kobold
13-04-2020T21:40:36,swedishkitsune,better with an portable solution like rope
13-04-2020T21:40:40,Kameloh,hmm eah
13-04-2020T21:41:00,Kameloh,man XD
13-04-2020T21:41:36,Kameloh,I need to draw like some kobold ideas

13-04-2020T21:48:00,Kameloh,hmmm
13-04-2020T21:49:17,swedishkitsune,make a shortstack Naoki with more energetic expression - boom kobold
13-04-2020T21:49:54,Kameloh,do peeps even draw them with hair
13-04-2020T21:50:03,swedishkitsune,depends

13-04-2020T21:59:34,Kameloh,need more practice
13-04-2020T22:00:00,Kameloh,'cause I would like to have maybe a kobold character
13-04-2020T22:00:10,Kameloh,just so it can match with the new dragon character :eyes:
13-04-2020T22:01:11,unsteddyphoenix,Give the kobold devil-y looks

13-04-2020T22:01:42,unsteddyphoenix,I guess all you could really do is make it red :thinking:

13-04-2020T22:03:16,Kameloh,red? :thinking:
13-04-2020T22:05:05,unsteddyphoenix,Well I was just sayin' that makin' a devily-kobold to contrast the angel-y dragon could be interestin
13-04-2020T22:05:23,Kameloh,thinkinnnng
13-04-2020T22:05:31,Kameloh,what would be her base color though
13-04-2020T22:06:12,swedishkitsune,grey/bluish
13-04-2020T22:06:23,unsteddyphoenix,"It'd have to be red, like a devil. If you were doin' that."
13-04-2020T22:06:33,Kameloh,:thinking:
13-04-2020T22:07:04,swedishkitsune,grey/blue is a good camo base color. they are predators and have no offensive things like fire to signal off like firedragons
13-04-2020T22:07:31,Kameloh,that's true :thinking:
13-04-2020T22:07:46,swedishkitsune,german ww2 panzer grey is a good base
