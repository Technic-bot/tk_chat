02-05-2020T00:03:44,JojoGD,i accidentally cut off my reaction

02-05-2020T00:06:41,AspiringNoodle,"heck, even the Darklurker boss fight"
02-05-2020T00:06:54,AspiringNoodle,But apparently this next one I'm about to tackle takes the cake
02-05-2020T00:07:21,AspiringNoodle,"To proceed through the area, you need to run between safe zones in an area constantly buffeted by blinding blizzards"
02-05-2020T00:07:44,AspiringNoodle,"In addition to low visibility and environmental hazards, there are god damn REINDEER that constantly spawn in the zone"
02-05-2020T00:07:56,AspiringNoodle,They're supposed to be tough AF and even be able to call down lightning.

02-05-2020T12:18:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I walked outside to check for them in time to see ones tail slip past my foot
02-05-2020T12:19:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I hate to say it but I may have to get a small handgun if I can’t find way to scare them off or transplant them elsewhere

02-05-2020T12:23:13,AspiringNoodle,Solution seems obvious
02-05-2020T12:23:18,AspiringNoodle,Burn the burn pile @w@

02-05-2020T15:15:25,CrimsonQuill,And crippling procrastination
02-05-2020T15:15:43,ThingsAreMoving,No time to be depressed if you keep yourself busy
02-05-2020T15:15:47,CrimsonQuill,We have over twenty cases of Covid-19 in my nursing home
02-05-2020T15:15:49,ThingsAreMoving,I suggest some DIY projects
02-05-2020T15:16:10,CrimsonQuill,So we have to be VERY careful with disinfecting the trolleys in the kitchen
02-05-2020T15:16:25,CrimsonQuill,I've been confirmed negative as per a test take two thursdays agoi
02-05-2020T15:16:42,CrimsonQuill,I'm trying to draw hands for the RvB/Twokinds oneshot comic.

02-05-2020T15:16:55,Roughlandin,Ditto what Ord said
02-05-2020T15:16:57,ThingsAreMoving,Stay safe.
02-05-2020T15:17:12,ThingsAreMoving,Most of my coworkers' relatives had tested positive
02-05-2020T15:17:25,ThingsAreMoving,and one of the managers is in hospital in an induced coma
02-05-2020T15:17:38,ThingsAreMoving,"but meh, If i am to get it I'll get it."
02-05-2020T15:19:43,Roughlandin,I've been locked down since March. I've got a father and cousin who are immuno-compromised and several relatives who are high risk. So I'm not taking my chances
02-05-2020T15:20:00,HoverdudeXL,Oh
02-05-2020T15:20:18,ThingsAreMoving,"yup, stay put"
02-05-2020T15:20:41,CrimsonQuill,Our lockdown will be eased through stages
02-05-2020T15:21:01,CrimsonQuill,I won't be able to visit my family till at least July
02-05-2020T15:21:11,HoverdudeXL,Dang
02-05-2020T15:21:24,BadFoMo,Sorry.
02-05-2020T15:21:41,Roughlandin,Got a notice from my state pharmacy board about re-upping my tech license in case they need emergency tech positions. I would do it if not for my family situation.
02-05-2020T15:22:09,Roughlandin,"Plus I'd rather never set foot in a pharmacy again if I can help it. Don't do pharm tech work, kids. Pro tip"
02-05-2020T15:22:11,ThingsAreMoving,"I'm hoping I'll be able to fly to my country and back in september, lol"
02-05-2020T15:22:56,Roughlandin,"Here's hoping, Things"
02-05-2020T15:23:16,ThingsAreMoving,my ID card has expired and my only other valid document is my passport which expires next july.
02-05-2020T15:23:35,HoverdudeXL,Why not just practice things you want to do
02-05-2020T15:23:57,ThingsAreMoving,practice flying?
02-05-2020T15:24:17,Roughlandin,"Don't do things. Not unless he consents, anyway"
02-05-2020T15:24:27,HoverdudeXL,At home. Flring at possible. Unless its game
02-05-2020T15:25:29,Ordithus,"flying is fun, but really expensive unless you get paid to do it"
02-05-2020T15:25:37,Ordithus,or are a bird
02-05-2020T15:25:41,ThingsAreMoving,aren't pharma jobs one of the highest paying jobs?
02-05-2020T15:25:46,Roughlandin,Or a dergum
02-05-2020T15:26:03,Roughlandin,Not pharm techs. I started at minimum wage.
02-05-2020T15:26:12,ThingsAreMoving,Can fly only in my dreams. Or when on board of an airplane.
02-05-2020T15:26:27,Roughlandin,After 5 years I was making like 12.50 an hour
02-05-2020T15:26:40,ThingsAreMoving,that's... not much
02-05-2020T15:27:32,CrimsonQuill,I'm on €10.00 an hour on seven-and-a-half hour shifts.
02-05-2020T15:27:40,CrimsonQuill,That's the minimum wage here...
02-05-2020T15:27:44,Roughlandin,"No it wasn't lol. I'd have rather worked at McDonalds. People treat you the same, and you don't risk killing somebody if you mess up their burger."
02-05-2020T15:27:45,ThingsAreMoving,when I started working in my current industry I had ~8.50 plus shift allowance which basically made it 10.2
02-05-2020T15:27:46,CrimsonQuill,But I'm part time
02-05-2020T15:28:05,ThingsAreMoving,"Now I'm on 12.35 basic, and will have a pay review in august"
02-05-2020T15:28:36,ThingsAreMoving,"highest paying jobs in this industry get ~21.00 per hour, so mayyyybe in few years I'll get there"
02-05-2020T15:29:06,ThingsAreMoving,that's in british pounds btw
02-05-2020T15:29:12,AspiringNoodle,My coworker almost had a mental breakdown yesterday :D
02-05-2020T15:29:28,AspiringNoodle,Eff this $9.50 an hour (+$2 an hour hazard pay) job :ptv-hearts:
02-05-2020T15:29:34,Roughlandin,"Sounds like the service industry, noodle"
02-05-2020T15:29:36,CrimsonQuill,@AspiringNoodle what happened?
02-05-2020T15:29:44,CrimsonQuill,@Roughlandin They're in Retail
02-05-2020T15:29:46,ThingsAreMoving,sounds like retail
02-05-2020T15:29:57,CrimsonQuill,Aspiring and I often chat about it
02-05-2020T15:29:59,ThingsAreMoving,"well, gas station if we were to be precise"
02-05-2020T15:30:32,Roughlandin,A gas station is kind of a service. I guess I was technically retail when you get down to it
02-05-2020T15:30:43,Glassan,"Gas station, retail, pretty much all customer service like that has similar experience."
02-05-2020T15:30:46,Roughlandin,Either way. Retail suchs
02-05-2020T15:30:49,Roughlandin,sucks
02-05-2020T15:30:56,Glassan,Indeed.
02-05-2020T15:31:04,BadFoMo,I can not ague.
02-05-2020T15:31:05,HoverdudeXL,Brb
02-05-2020T15:31:25,Glassan,Should be taken as a sign to treat those in that industry well when interacted with.
02-05-2020T15:31:34,CrimsonQuill,k
02-05-2020T15:31:39,Roughlandin,I had a better time as an intern at a local hospital. Hours could be brutal though
02-05-2020T15:31:42,Glassan,That's how I always treated it at least. :P
02-05-2020T15:31:57,ThingsAreMoving,I would not switch back from machine operating to working in service
02-05-2020T15:32:00,AspiringNoodle,I can honestly say this store is being mismanaged
02-05-2020T15:32:04,CrimsonQuill,I'm hoping for Surveying
02-05-2020T15:32:19,AspiringNoodle,Yesterday started off with the business opening 2 hours late because nobody showed up to unlock the doors
02-05-2020T15:32:20,Glassan,Surveying is honestly kinda fun.
02-05-2020T15:32:32,Roughlandin,Yeesh noodle
02-05-2020T15:32:33,ThingsAreMoving,"Noodle, most companies are being mismanaged"
02-05-2020T15:32:37,ThingsAreMoving,srsly
02-05-2020T15:32:50,AspiringNoodle,"Then, my coworker who was going to be on shift with me for 2nd ended up coming in 2 hours early to do paperwork"
02-05-2020T15:32:52,Glassan,"Wow, Noodle, that sounds aweful."
02-05-2020T15:32:56,Glassan,*awful
02-05-2020T15:33:10,AspiringNoodle,"She's not management, she shouldn't be doing that"
02-05-2020T15:33:22,Roughlandin,Yeah that sounds like an hours problem
02-05-2020T15:33:27,ThingsAreMoving,"why was she doing that, then"
02-05-2020T15:33:28,AspiringNoodle,She proceeds to end up trying to do paperwork that NEEDS done because the manager doesn't answer his phone on his days off
02-05-2020T15:33:39,AspiringNoodle,The AM never showed up
02-05-2020T15:33:54,AspiringNoodle,Nearly has that breakdown on several occasions
02-05-2020T15:34:15,AspiringNoodle,"And spend nearly 7 hours doing the managers' jobs, meaning I was basically running the front of store solo"
02-05-2020T15:34:30,Glassan,Ouch.
02-05-2020T15:34:33,AspiringNoodle,"It took me 3 hours to finish a list of cigarettes that needed restocked, because it was just non-stop customers"
02-05-2020T15:34:36,Roughlandin,That sounds more like NO management than mismanagement
02-05-2020T15:34:41,AspiringNoodle,"Like, not joking"
02-05-2020T15:35:06,KeefMcDerpface,Hello
02-05-2020T15:35:07,AspiringNoodle,3 - 6 P.M. was me ringing out customers and making a list of cigarettes in the display that could be filled with an entire carton
02-05-2020T15:35:12,Roughlandin,Oof. Having to stock and deal with customers is something I can sympathize with
02-05-2020T15:35:14,Glassan,"Honestly, that's the issue with management. There is far more responsibility and requirements than what the slight pay increase represents."
02-05-2020T15:35:16,ThingsAreMoving,that sounds like you need a bit more of that not-my-effing-problem attitude in your life
02-05-2020T15:35:18,Glassan,"Also, Hi, Keef"
02-05-2020T15:35:23,Roughlandin,Hi Keef!
02-05-2020T15:35:24,ThingsAreMoving,o/ keef
02-05-2020T15:35:25,CrimsonQuill,hullo keef
02-05-2020T15:35:49,KeefMcDerpface,"Hello Glassan, Rough, Things, and Quill."
02-05-2020T15:36:04,ThingsAreMoving,if your company can't provide enough workforce you shouldn't restock the cigarettes tbh
02-05-2020T15:36:08,ThingsAreMoving,I wouldn't
02-05-2020T15:36:12,AspiringNoodle,"So basically, until 7:30 or so, no store related tasks could get done"
02-05-2020T15:36:13,Sammit,Hi Keef
02-05-2020T15:36:26,KeefMcDerpface,Hello Sammit
02-05-2020T15:36:31,AspiringNoodle,I don't think the coffee ever got remade on 2nd
02-05-2020T15:36:45,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-whiny: Not the coffee.
02-05-2020T15:36:54,AspiringNoodle,"So when I FINALLY was able to dump it, it was probably 6+ hours old at minimum\"
02-05-2020T15:37:01,Roughlandin,Blech
02-05-2020T15:37:09,Glassan,Tasty.
02-05-2020T15:37:28,Ordithus,"ice coffee, hold the ice"
02-05-2020T15:37:40,ThingsAreMoving,"wew, noodle. I'm getting flashbacks from when I was working at a gas station"
02-05-2020T15:37:48,Roughlandin,Leave it a couple hours and you've got coffee pudding
02-05-2020T15:37:50,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, I'm just done"
02-05-2020T15:37:56,ThingsAreMoving,"change jobs asap, srsly."
02-05-2020T15:38:08,AspiringNoodle,And this is on top of us lacking cleaning agent for the coffee pots for the past 2 weeks
02-05-2020T15:38:34,AspiringNoodle,"Management's answer, ""refer to the wash-rinse-sanitize"" instructions in the dishwashing area"
02-05-2020T15:38:57,Roughlandin,Yeah that don't sound up to sanitary code
02-05-2020T15:39:01,AspiringNoodle,nevermind that those instructions include physically washing stuff.  How the hell am I supposed to clean the inside of those things physically?!?
02-05-2020T15:39:10,Roughlandin,Find a child
02-05-2020T15:39:14,Roughlandin,smol hands
02-05-2020T15:39:15,KeefMcDerpface,lol
02-05-2020T15:39:20,AspiringNoodle,"We literally use a packet of cleaner, run it for 3-packs worth of water, and the chemicals completely scrub the inside"
02-05-2020T15:39:24,ThingsAreMoving,apply thermodynamics for psysical washing
02-05-2020T15:39:34,ThingsAreMoving,physical*
02-05-2020T15:40:19,AspiringNoodle,"I took pictures of everything, still haven't actually made an imgur album, haha"
02-05-2020T15:40:41,ThingsAreMoving,you might want to send an anonymous note to your regional manager
02-05-2020T15:40:49,Roughlandin,Document everything
02-05-2020T15:40:53,KeefMcDerpface,^
02-05-2020T15:40:56,AspiringNoodle,"But some of the pots looks like somebody attempted to actually wash them, and coincidentally my coworker said she tried to at one point"
02-05-2020T15:41:26,ThingsAreMoving,use the car hand wash station to clean the coffee machine
02-05-2020T15:41:35,AspiringNoodle,"But gave up because it's way too much effort to even get those little scratches in the stains, and it'll be impossible to completely clean the inside (hence why we use those cleaning packets)"
02-05-2020T15:41:44,AspiringNoodle,"Also, I'm tired of my coworkers being lazy"
02-05-2020T15:42:17,Glassan,"Eh, you pick your battles. Nothing wrong with that."
02-05-2020T15:42:24,AspiringNoodle,"They make messes and don't clean up after themselves, or leave things in such a way that it will end up in a mess later.  Like changing trash bags but not making sure the container is actually UNDER the opening"
02-05-2020T15:42:43,Roughlandin,My grandad had a saying. Never be the best at digging ditches. They'll just give you a bigger shovel.
02-05-2020T15:43:08,ThingsAreMoving,100% agree
02-05-2020T15:43:11,Glassan,"@Roughlandin, thank you, that is my new favorite saying."
02-05-2020T15:43:35,ThingsAreMoving,"when working for someone, never give your 100%, make it look like you're doing it."
02-05-2020T15:43:39,Roughlandin,Lol it applies to so many things in life.
02-05-2020T15:43:42,Ordithus,Then they replace you with a mechanical shovel and you die trying to outdo it
02-05-2020T15:43:43,Glassan,"Only variant I had at work for that was, ""The only reward for work well done is more work."
02-05-2020T15:44:09,KeefMcDerpface,Why are we digging ditches in the first place? Are we burying bodies?
02-05-2020T15:44:12,Glassan,Go by the Scottie Principle.
02-05-2020T15:44:17,AspiringNoodle,"Sadly, I feel kinda compelled to work this hard.  CYOA."
02-05-2020T15:44:24,Roughlandin,@Ordithus Isn't that how Paul Bunyan died?
02-05-2020T15:44:25,ThingsAreMoving,"getting the trenches ready, Keef"
02-05-2020T15:44:39,Ordithus,legend of John Henry
02-05-2020T15:44:43,Glassan,Also burying bodies.
02-05-2020T15:44:47,AspiringNoodle,"If they ever start doing write-ups for not completing shift tasks, I can always say ""look at the cameras"""
02-05-2020T15:44:52,Roughlandin,@Keef He was a marine. Digging ditches was like 95% of his job.
02-05-2020T15:45:08,Roughlandin,@Ordithus: That's the one!
02-05-2020T15:45:40,FloofyCat,aww yis homemade pizza
02-05-2020T15:45:43,ThingsAreMoving,"Hah, reminds me of military definition of time-space: dig a trench from that tree till 2PM"

02-05-2020T15:46:52,Roughlandin,My grandad had another saying. Pizza is like sex. Even bad pizza is still pizza.

02-05-2020T15:47:26,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floraquestion: do I know your granddad?
02-05-2020T15:47:30,Glassan,You don't get to that age without gathering quite a few good ones.
02-05-2020T15:47:31,Ordithus,I've heard that one before
02-05-2020T15:47:49,Roughlandin,Pretty sure he got it from somewhere else lol
02-05-2020T15:47:52,ThingsAreMoving,I think I've heard that pizza one at some point in my life.
02-05-2020T15:48:00,Ordithus,phew
02-05-2020T15:48:30,KeefMcDerpface,So you're telling me every time I had pizza I was actually having [REDACTED]?
02-05-2020T15:48:41,Roughlandin,It's not impossible
02-05-2020T15:48:44,ThingsAreMoving,was it good?
02-05-2020T15:48:52,Roughlandin,It was pizza. That's enough.
02-05-2020T15:48:53,ThingsAreMoving,"then it doesn't matter, really."
02-05-2020T15:49:47,Roughlandin,Pizza always matters
02-05-2020T15:50:09,AspiringNoodle,"Well, I've sent all the photos I've taken to my email"
02-05-2020T15:50:22,Roughlandin,We're all witnesses

02-05-2020T15:50:35,ThingsAreMoving,The only time when I don't want pizza is when I finished eating one.
02-05-2020T15:50:35,AspiringNoodle,"By the way, it's worth reiterating that the first time I checked dates shortly after starting this job, I found something that expired in DEC 2017"

02-05-2020T15:51:54,Roughlandin,They were sunflower plants by the time he found them

02-05-2020T15:58:53,Roughlandin,I was just happy when we finally got an imaging pill counter so I didn't have to manually count hundreds of pills for each order
02-05-2020T15:58:56,SpazztasticKiwi,my last and only guess now is it’s the outlet
02-05-2020T15:58:58,SpazztasticKiwi,but
02-05-2020T15:59:15,ThingsAreMoving,I thought you'd just package them by weight
02-05-2020T15:59:18,Roughlandin,Still had to double count the controlled meds
02-05-2020T15:59:24,ThingsAreMoving,aren't pills uniform in weight?

02-05-2020T17:53:54,Roughlandin,That... is a while ago
02-05-2020T17:53:57,ThingsAreMoving,weird
02-05-2020T17:54:05,LogicIsHere,computers sometimes man -_-
02-05-2020T17:54:13,KeefMcDerpface,"Tom, what's your call?"
02-05-2020T17:54:16,Roughlandin,Computers othertimes machine
02-05-2020T17:54:31,unsteddyphoenix,ohhh yeah. huh. oh well.
02-05-2020T17:54:38,ThingsAreMoving,"meh, Illiar has it covered, probably, anyway"
02-05-2020T17:54:43,LogicIsHere,okay that made me laugh Rough :clap:
02-05-2020T17:54:46,Roughlandin,WE'LL DO IT LIVE!
02-05-2020T17:55:07,Twokinds,I'll call a break after this sketch
02-05-2020T17:55:13,KeefMcDerpface,okay
02-05-2020T17:55:20,ThingsAreMoving,sounds good
02-05-2020T17:55:25,LogicIsHere,yus
02-05-2020T17:55:32,Roughlandin,Gotta call a huddle first. And a play. I recommend the QB sneak.
02-05-2020T17:55:58,Roughlandin,I'm quippy tonight. Did NOT get enough sleep last night...
02-05-2020T17:56:04,LogicIsHere,"during the break we'll see about getting Keith home, he's drunk XD"
02-05-2020T17:56:11,Roughlandin,And sad...
02-05-2020T17:56:15,ThingsAreMoving,I once tried recording this stream but I messed up the settings and was saving everything without compression. My HDD never filled up so quickly as it did then.
02-05-2020T17:56:22,InTheLionsDen,All his kids will see to getting him home.
02-05-2020T17:56:22,TeapotOfDoom,he needs some reassurance
02-05-2020T17:56:23,Roughlandin,*Hugs sad drunk Keith*
02-05-2020T17:56:46,KeefMcDerpface,also hugs sad Keith
02-05-2020T17:57:05,CrimsonQuill,puts a blanket on Keith
02-05-2020T17:57:06,InTheLionsDen,"""Daddy, please come home."""
02-05-2020T17:57:08,Roughlandin,"Closing time. You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here."
02-05-2020T17:57:16,Ordithus,"Videos get biiiig, things"
02-05-2020T17:57:22,ShamusTheFox,"Is Keith a lightweight, or can he hold his booze?"
02-05-2020T17:57:35,KeefMcDerpface,"Well, he's not a Keidran so..."
02-05-2020T17:57:44,Roughlandin,He's a Basitin. They have natural poison resistance
02-05-2020T17:57:46,ThingsAreMoving,"I know, but there was an effort."
02-05-2020T17:58:06,LogicIsHere,"I have no idea what the average is as someone who doesn't drink, but I assume he's not a lightweight"
02-05-2020T17:58:07,ThingsAreMoving,"I'll give it another shot eventually, just gotta read a bit more documentation"
02-05-2020T17:58:18,Ordithus,compression is key
02-05-2020T17:58:46,Roughlandin,Relative to other Basitins is a toss-up. But he could probably drink most humans or keidran under the table
02-05-2020T17:59:00,SpazztasticKiwi,can you play dont starve together as single player
02-05-2020T17:59:02,CrimsonQuill,"My rule for alcohol is, if you've found your limit, you've had too much."
02-05-2020T17:59:18,ThingsAreMoving,"There is a don't starve, singleplayer game"
02-05-2020T17:59:23,LogicIsHere,yes
02-05-2020T17:59:23,CrimsonQuill,I'm limiting myself to a shot of Jameson's on Sundays
02-05-2020T17:59:31,LogicIsHere,it's called Don't Starve
02-05-2020T17:59:36,ThingsAreMoving,"but you should be able to play a multiplayer game on your own, too"
02-05-2020T17:59:43,ContagiousBordem16,Hi
02-05-2020T17:59:43,LogicIsHere,maybe
02-05-2020T17:59:46,LogicIsHere,never played
02-05-2020T17:59:49,KeefMcDerpface,Hello Bordem
02-05-2020T17:59:49,Ordithus,hi bordem
02-05-2020T17:59:52,ThingsAreMoving,o/ Bordem
02-05-2020T17:59:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I know but if together can be single player I don’t have to get the other one
02-05-2020T17:59:54,Roughlandin,There's also Don't Starve Together Alone
02-05-2020T17:59:55,Dadrobit,o/ Cont
02-05-2020T17:59:58,AspiringNoodle,Can Basitins even get drunk?
02-05-2020T18:00:13,Roughlandin,Everything can get drunk. It's all a matter of scale
02-05-2020T18:00:13,LogicIsHere,Probably
02-05-2020T18:00:14,Ordithus,eventually
02-05-2020T18:00:16,CrRAR,They just need rocket fuel
02-05-2020T18:00:22,KeefMcDerpface,We had sketches in the past that points to yes.
02-05-2020T18:00:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a list of games to check out
02-05-2020T18:00:25,unsteddyphoenix,with enough effort....
02-05-2020T18:00:29,Roughlandin,It'd be very expensive
02-05-2020T18:00:32,SpazztasticKiwi,gots to do yer research
02-05-2020T18:00:34,AspiringNoodle,Because this feels like Captain America all over again :c
02-05-2020T18:00:52,ShamusTheFox,Wasn't Keith's father drunk on the day of the murdet?
02-05-2020T18:01:00,Roughlandin,"Keith is Captain Basidia. Technically, General Basidia. But still"
02-05-2020T18:01:04,Ordithus,yes
02-05-2020T18:01:14,Ordithus,as was Alabaster
02-05-2020T18:01:27,Roughlandin,@ShamusTheFox: On Basitin liqour. Which would probably kill most non-basitins
02-05-2020T18:01:39,RimaDraws,who is that in the background
02-05-2020T18:01:44,Ordithus,yeah when Mike dropped the basitin rum he died
02-05-2020T18:01:45,AspiringNoodle,"Oof, then this won't do a thing for him..."
02-05-2020T18:01:48,SpazztasticKiwi,now what are we doing again
02-05-2020T18:01:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve been preoccupied
02-05-2020T18:01:58,Ordithus,Looks like Madelyn
02-05-2020T18:02:11,Dadrobit,Older Maddie?
02-05-2020T18:02:19,ThingsAreMoving,The original stalker girl
02-05-2020T18:02:23,ThingsAreMoving,:eyes:
02-05-2020T18:02:28,unsteddyphoenix,older gay maddie?
02-05-2020T18:02:31,KeefMcDerpface,"""He's been drinking for two years now..."""
02-05-2020T18:02:40,Dadrobit,They can be gay together
02-05-2020T18:02:45,unsteddyphoenix,if this is bartender maddie canon
02-05-2020T18:02:57,Ordithus,maybe this is after Maeve and Nat have both passed on
02-05-2020T18:03:06,Dadrobit,"ohhhh, that was a thing, forgot the bartender angle"
02-05-2020T18:03:06,ThingsAreMoving,"Dark, Ord."
02-05-2020T18:03:08,SpazztasticKiwi,stalker....she prefers self hired private investigator
02-05-2020T18:03:09,ThingsAreMoving,I like it
02-05-2020T18:03:13,unsteddyphoenix,awwwh
02-05-2020T18:03:16,RimaDraws,oof
02-05-2020T18:03:36,CrRAR,"Yeah maybe the ""Couldn't save anyone"" possibility"
02-05-2020T18:03:40,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Sad sketch
02-05-2020T18:03:40,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I'm down with that ord"
02-05-2020T18:03:42,Roughlandin,I mean makes sense. Basitins have human-ish lifespans and keidran kinda... don't
02-05-2020T18:03:43,ThingsAreMoving,Life is suffering
02-05-2020T18:03:46,Ordithus,it's a real problem when your lover has half your lifespan
02-05-2020T18:04:03,ThingsAreMoving,"You get two lovers, problem solved"
02-05-2020T18:04:06,SpazztasticKiwi,ok mr sunshine
02-05-2020T18:04:11,K3IDRAN,Wel' I just overthrew the Whiterun government lol
02-05-2020T18:04:33,LogicIsHere,"When I found out Flora's lifespan compared to Trace's, my heart sank ;3;"
02-05-2020T18:04:45,Roughlandin,I think Nat and Maeve would be okay if this happened after they were gone
02-05-2020T18:05:07,Roughlandin,...Or they'd be super jealous and haunt them both forever...
02-05-2020T18:05:14,CrimsonQuill,collapses on their sketchook
02-05-2020T18:05:18,ShamusTheFox,Maeve?

02-05-2020T18:05:45,CrimsonQuill,Just...have to...colour it...

02-05-2020T20:19:05,Dadrobit,How so? Brutus was all about blindly and stupidly following orders to hurt random people. Sythe was a trained diplomat who disobeyed orders to attack random people...
02-05-2020T20:19:26,Dadrobit,to avoid attacking random people*
02-05-2020T20:19:32,unsteddyphoenix,but theyre both wolves!

02-05-2020T20:20:41,Glassan,I would say Brutus is more like a trusting child that doesn't fully comprehend what he's doing.
02-05-2020T20:21:04,microbuss,mmm tuna
02-05-2020T20:21:19,Roughlandin,I think Prose was referencing Brutus getting a sidekick like Sythe. Not shipping Brutus and Sythe
02-05-2020T20:22:47,BlackjackSec99,suprised Maeve
02-05-2020T20:23:13,Glassan,Brutus would probably be a sidekick to Sythe. Or both of them would be co-sidekicks.
02-05-2020T20:23:25,Roughlandin,Will this be the fabled Momma tail nomma?
02-05-2020T20:23:38,KeefMcDerpface,"One of them: ""I though you were the sidekick."""
02-05-2020T20:23:59,BluePhantom90,Doing wooden spoon banging on the pot or something more funny Tom?
02-05-2020T20:24:38,KeefMcDerpface,Why not an airhorn?
02-05-2020T20:24:39,Dadrobit,Dunno how well Sythe would tolerate Brutus. Sythe seems to be a character focused on learning and understanding other people and their lives. Naivety isn't the best defense for attacking innocent people.

02-05-2020T20:25:13,Dadrobit,Brutus would have to go through a heckuva character redemption arc first.
02-05-2020T20:25:21,Glassan,Could just be an AU where Brutus laid his loyalties with someone not so heinous.

02-05-2020T20:25:39,Glassan,Like both of them working for the wolf elder.
02-05-2020T20:25:41,Dadrobit,Then they're really not the same character are they.
02-05-2020T20:26:10,Ordithus,I 'member when Brutus was shipped with Alice.  Simpler times
02-05-2020T20:26:12,Stormagedon,"Ok, My draft is submitted now. I can watch cool art stuff thing"
02-05-2020T20:26:13,Glassan,"I mean, you could say that about all the AU characters, in that case."
02-05-2020T20:26:29,Roughlandin,Did Brutus ever actually fire a shot during the raid in-panel?
02-05-2020T20:26:35,ThingsAreMoving,"Wait, what? Who's Alice?"
02-05-2020T20:26:37,Glassan,"Indeed, Alice x brutus ship was funny."

02-05-2020T20:26:47,Stormagedon,after I go throw some trash away
