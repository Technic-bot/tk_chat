19-04-2020T04:11:30,AspiringNoodle,"By this time in Dark Souls 1, I'd have faced off against... let's see.  This many hours in, I'd probably have faced the starter area boss, the Taurus Demon, the Capra Demon, and either be well on my way to it, or have killed the Gaping Dragon."
19-04-2020T04:12:35,AspiringNoodle,"Correction: Asylum Demon (starter area), Taurus Demon, Bell Gargoyles, Moonlight Butterfly.  And then probably just killed the Capra demon before moving on."

19-04-2020T14:31:15,CrRAR,Crude at -40ish dollars

19-04-2020T14:31:48,CrimsonQuill,"Wait, pardon?"
19-04-2020T14:32:08,CrimsonQuill,Who's paying who to get Petrol/Diesel?
19-04-2020T14:32:20,CrRAR,Crude price per barrel today is at -$50 somehow
19-04-2020T14:33:14,CrRAR,Suposedly actual station prices will catch up eventually because of the detachment between live market and the spot price or whatever
19-04-2020T14:33:26,CrimsonQuill,Oh.
19-04-2020T14:34:11,CrRAR,"I mean stations have to make money, so I suppose it would never go negative in real-world"
19-04-2020T14:35:03,CrimsonQuill,I see.
19-04-2020T14:35:10,CrimsonQuill,Well.
19-04-2020T14:35:23,CrimsonQuill,That's probably due to the economy Fluctuating and whatnot.
19-04-2020T14:36:09,CrRAR,"Yeah between there being absolutely no demand and the production war going on, perfect storm of overstock oil."
19-04-2020T14:36:18,CrRAR,"“So great Cheeto, you want big flowy oil business? Good. You’ll drown in it.”"
19-04-2020T14:36:28,CrRAR,*world opens oil taps*
19-04-2020T14:36:37,CrimsonQuill,I hope that the oil runs out soon to be honest...
19-04-2020T14:36:54,CrRAR,"Yeah, focus should be on green energy."
19-04-2020T14:37:00,CrimsonQuill,So the fat cats supporting it can't lobby to block the other energy generation anymore
19-04-2020T14:37:06,CrimsonQuill,...
19-04-2020T14:37:35,CrimsonQuill,I am very hostile towards what I concieve as the 'upper class' of corporate industry...but I probably generalize too much.
19-04-2020T14:37:50,CrRAR,I’m sure it would lead to other resource stuggles/controls though. Like there’s lots of common elements needed for green energy.
19-04-2020T14:39:22,CrRAR,"One thing too that sucks about all this is low prices actually discourage green energy, be that it’s still in its infancy and more expensive."
19-04-2020T14:39:38,CrimsonQuill,But the more we put into it...
19-04-2020T14:39:44,CrimsonQuill,The better it becomes...
19-04-2020T14:39:46,CrRAR,No need to buy the 80000 electric car if the cost of gas is $.50
19-04-2020T14:39:48,CrRAR,yeah!
19-04-2020T14:40:07,CrimsonQuill,And we can LAUGH as the Oil Lobby BURNS in the FIRES OF JUSTICE!

19-04-2020T14:41:43,CrRAR,Yeah that’s been the greatest drive of more green energy generation being adopted is the advances and it quickly cheapening.
19-04-2020T14:42:03,CrimsonQuill,There are things called Sunslates and solar shingles.
19-04-2020T14:42:15,CrimsonQuill,They are literally Solar panels as your roof tiles.
19-04-2020T14:42:22,CrRAR,"Yes, Tesla’s solar rooves are so cool"
19-04-2020T14:43:00,CrRAR,I thought about how dumb it was to bolt goofy panels to roofs
19-04-2020T14:44:08,CrRAR,"Like, 1) why drill holes in the roof in the first place, and 2) what happens when you need to redo the asphalt shingles?"
19-04-2020T14:44:36,CrRAR,"Just seems like a, well, bolt-on solution."
19-04-2020T14:44:54,CrimsonQuill,There are many ways to use home energy.
19-04-2020T14:45:01,CrRAR,Who makes the Sunslates?
19-04-2020T14:45:03,CrimsonQuill,"Solar panels, a miniature wind turbine..."
19-04-2020T14:45:08,CrimsonQuill,@CrRAR I have no idea
19-04-2020T14:45:16,CrRAR,haha
19-04-2020T14:45:33,CrimsonQuill,I read it in a book called 'Eco-Refurbishment' written in the 2000s
19-04-2020T14:46:06,CrRAR,"minature turbine, andwe thought those old farms with windmills were a thing of the past."
19-04-2020T14:46:41,CrRAR,Now everyone wants to grow their own food again and put up turbines.
19-04-2020T14:46:46,CrimsonQuill,"Poorly placed Wind farms are disasterous, that's true"
19-04-2020T14:46:56,CrimsonQuill,But when placed correctly they are excellent.

19-04-2020T14:51:56,Dadrobit,"When they're out of the house, yeah."
19-04-2020T14:51:56,CrRAR,It’s the collest if you can sell the surplus. xD

19-04-2020T14:52:05,CrRAR,Nice
19-04-2020T14:52:45,Dadrobit,"But still, living in AZ, air con is mandatory, so that takes a shitload of energy. Offsets a lot of the summer gains in efficiency."
19-04-2020T14:52:59,Dadrobit,But that's what they're there for I s'pose
19-04-2020T14:53:12,CrRAR,true
19-04-2020T14:53:31,Dadrobit,And they have swamp coolers for the inbetween months.
19-04-2020T14:53:55,Dadrobit,Fantastic cooling for very little energy comparably.
19-04-2020T14:54:25,CrRAR,Is that the thing where it blows air over ice?
19-04-2020T14:54:48,CrimsonQuill,Hey guys
19-04-2020T14:54:53,CrimsonQuill,Quick question
19-04-2020T14:54:59,CrimsonQuill,Since my suggestion was drawn last night
19-04-2020T14:55:00,Dadrobit,Giant fan inside a cage of wet material.
19-04-2020T14:55:14,CrimsonQuill,Does that mean that I'm off the roster the first week of the next month?
19-04-2020T14:55:27,Dadrobit,Sucks air through the wet medium cooling it off before throwing it into the house.
19-04-2020T14:55:39,CrRAR,"Ah, I see"
19-04-2020T14:55:49,CrRAR,Yeah there’s a cooldown
19-04-2020T14:55:50,Dadrobit,"No, only off if you get a color."
19-04-2020T14:55:58,CrimsonQuill,"@Dadrobit Ah, I see."
19-04-2020T14:56:09,CrRAR,"Ah, I din’t know that"
19-04-2020T14:56:11,CrimsonQuill,Thanks
19-04-2020T14:57:08,Dadrobit,"I think there's a rule that is sometimes enforced where you only get one sketch a month, but I don't think it's actually enforced."
19-04-2020T14:57:35,Dadrobit,Getting a color does take you out for the next month though.
19-04-2020T14:58:19,Dadrobit,"Least, it used to. I've been mostly absent from Sunday colors for the better part of a year, only recently back in with lockdown."
19-04-2020T14:58:36,Dadrobit,So things may have changed in my absence.
19-04-2020T14:58:56,CrimsonQuill,I see
19-04-2020T14:59:26,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I doubt mine'll be coloured, the others deserve colours more tbh."
19-04-2020T14:59:33,CrimsonQuill,There are some good ones
19-04-2020T14:59:40,Dadrobit,"Also, CrRar, the swamp cooler loses efficiency the more humid it is, so it's doubly effective in dryer parts of Az."
19-04-2020T14:59:51,CrRAR,Oh nice
19-04-2020T15:00:05,CrRAR,Thermodynamics FTW
19-04-2020T15:00:32,Dadrobit,Basitin Kat is a shoe-in for first. Not even remotely possible that one doesn't get a million votes.

19-04-2020T15:56:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I wanted it off in the woods on the other side of the road and not on the building cause it was reachable & there’s be someone that’s squish it
19-04-2020T16:00:26,SpazztasticKiwi,the imperial moth is in the family - the one species said to be in trouble

19-04-2020T18:28:03,Dadrobit,"Eyyyyy, I got a payout from a class action suit!"
19-04-2020T18:28:17,Dadrobit,$60.84. I'll take it
19-04-2020T18:28:25,AspiringNoodle,"That saaruuk guy, right?"
19-04-2020T18:28:32,AspiringNoodle,"Lol, what for, daddo?"
19-04-2020T18:30:04,Dadrobit,AMD false advertisement.
19-04-2020T18:30:09,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s a good example why I close to avoid the fandom anymore
19-04-2020T18:30:20,SpazztasticKiwi,so what was the whole fiasco
19-04-2020T18:30:40,SpazztasticKiwi,was it from work or somethin
19-04-2020T18:31:04,Dadrobit,Bulldozer chipset was advertising in my case 8 core CPU's
19-04-2020T18:31:20,Dadrobit,"In reality, they are 4 core, 8 thread CPU's"
19-04-2020T18:31:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"tsk tsk, somebody can’t count"
19-04-2020T18:31:53,SpazztasticKiwi,or hoped no one could read
19-04-2020T18:32:14,AspiringNoodle,"The truth is a bit more complicated than that, honestly"
19-04-2020T18:32:31,SpazztasticKiwi,obviously
19-04-2020T18:32:39,AspiringNoodle,They had an interesting concept for their CPU design
19-04-2020T18:33:05,AspiringNoodle,"They aren't quit 4 core cpus with hyperthreading, or 8 cores / 8 threads"
19-04-2020T18:33:08,SpazztasticKiwi,im only on break and that could take all day to lay out
19-04-2020T18:33:32,AspiringNoodle,"It was somewhere inbetween, where the processor cores were like mini units that shared high bandwidth memory"
19-04-2020T18:33:58,SpazztasticKiwi,so did everyone that got one get a settlement
19-04-2020T18:34:15,AspiringNoodle,"Obviously, it turned out to be a flawed design, but by advertisement standards, yes, it was false advertising"
19-04-2020T18:35:03,Ordithus,":ctwokinds-nibsbounce: oh yeah, I got one of those!"
19-04-2020T18:35:07,Ordithus,FX 8370
19-04-2020T18:35:36,Ordithus,Completely knew what it was when I got it.
19-04-2020T18:35:39,SpazztasticKiwi,booming announcer: “you might be entitled to financial compensation”
19-04-2020T18:36:09,Ordithus,Up to the value of the component I'm perfectly happy with!
19-04-2020T18:36:28,RimaDraws,hi
19-04-2020T18:37:30,AspiringNoodle,hi :D
19-04-2020T18:37:37,Ordithus,o/
19-04-2020T18:37:37,AspiringNoodle,We're just discussing computer hardware junk
19-04-2020T18:38:02,AspiringNoodle,"And in all honesty, if you buy a CPU based purely on the tech specs alone, ""Yer a moron, Harry!"""
19-04-2020T18:38:34,Dadrobit,"Essentially, it was a 4 core (4 FPU cores) and each core had two ALU cores."
19-04-2020T18:38:35,AspiringNoodle,Gotta get that good review / testing numbers info
19-04-2020T18:38:50,Dadrobit,"That they advertised as ""8 native cores"""
19-04-2020T18:39:02,AspiringNoodle,"Yup, that's false, lol"
19-04-2020T18:39:28,Dadrobit,I purchased one exactly like that lol. It was my very first build. Imagine my surprise.
19-04-2020T18:39:56,Dadrobit,Later ended up upgrading the CPU. Still have it in my secondary computer.
19-04-2020T18:40:05,Dadrobit,So I got a settlement for 2 of them.
19-04-2020T18:40:08,Ordithus,It was the best cpu I could throw into my circa 2011 mobo
19-04-2020T18:40:21,Ordithus,I'm due for an upgrade haha
19-04-2020T18:40:26,Dadrobit,AM3+. Lasted for a dang while there
19-04-2020T18:40:34,AspiringNoodle,Let's see how long AM4 lasts! :D
19-04-2020T18:40:55,AspiringNoodle,"I'm hoping that it lasts long enough where I can throw a new CPU into this thing, and maybe get 10 years out of the mobo"
19-04-2020T18:41:23,Dadrobit,"3800X. Only one game has made this machine chug, and it was/is a mass simulator game."
19-04-2020T18:41:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll look for a good handful of reviews with pictures on anything I buy
19-04-2020T18:41:56,SpazztasticKiwi,with explainations
19-04-2020T18:42:10,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s best when looking for clothes
19-04-2020T18:44:14,AspiringNoodle,"3700x,  couldn't justify the price increase, lol"
19-04-2020T18:44:33,AspiringNoodle,"And I am still unsure about slamming more cores into this PC.  360 AIO, and I'm STILL worried about temps"
19-04-2020T18:54:18,SpazztasticKiwi,it’d be great if you could report comments

19-04-2020T21:56:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"every time I’ve seen, he’s been texting"
19-04-2020T21:57:15,CrRAR,So many sidechicks
19-04-2020T21:58:04,SpazztasticKiwi,he better pray not
19-04-2020T21:58:08,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s engaged
19-04-2020T21:58:36,SpazztasticKiwi,to someone I know from hs
19-04-2020T21:58:45,SpazztasticKiwi,and she’s pregnant
19-04-2020T21:58:55,CrRAR,Oh this is new guy?
19-04-2020T21:59:17,CrRAR,Explains his aversion to racking the chickens
19-04-2020T21:59:31,CrRAR,“My people”
19-04-2020T21:59:33,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-LauraCry:
19-04-2020T21:59:55,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s the only guy that works back in the deli
19-04-2020T22:01:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"we don’t get people to stick around, but guys don’t opt to try getting hired there"
19-04-2020T22:01:31,SpazztasticKiwi,the last two didn’t last max of two weeks
19-04-2020T22:01:58,CrRAR,This boy’s got obligations~
19-04-2020T22:03:21,CrRAR,"Maybe he’ll learn some dicipline, has there been improvement?"
19-04-2020T22:03:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"after getting hounded for washing his hands more, little"
19-04-2020T22:03:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"once he got in trouble, it’s definitely better"
19-04-2020T22:04:16,SpazztasticKiwi,now it’s a case of leave the phone in your pocket and work
19-04-2020T22:05:32,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s not bad - he’s rather entertaining and good if he gets to working
19-04-2020T22:07:07,CrRAR,Well at least his heart is in the right place
19-04-2020T22:07:32,SpazztasticKiwi,theoretically
19-04-2020T22:08:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve told him many times to wear gloves when doing dishes or using chemicals because they can eat skin
19-04-2020T22:08:24,SpazztasticKiwi,but his attitude is who needs limbs
19-04-2020T22:08:32,CrRAR,...sounds like his brain... well that’s another story.
19-04-2020T22:09:11,AspiringNoodle,*phew* that's enough dark souls for today
19-04-2020T22:09:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"much like him saying internal organs are accessories and unimportant, they’re meant to be  “jokes”"
19-04-2020T22:09:21,AspiringNoodle,Dummy coworker shenanigans?
19-04-2020T22:09:28,SpazztasticKiwi,but the problem is jokes are funny

19-04-2020T22:12:22,SpazztasticKiwi,you see the video of the girl fanning out the $100s from her check for ig with the window down and someone reaches in and snatches it
19-04-2020T22:13:03,CrRAR,nooo

19-04-2020T22:16:13,AspiringNoodle,"Fun fact, if the person get's caught that's grand larceny, an automatic felony :upside_down:"
19-04-2020T22:17:07,SpazztasticKiwi,you’re only in trouble if you get caught
19-04-2020T22:17:11,AspiringNoodle,So hopefully it was just a stunt
19-04-2020T22:17:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"and the argument is if you don’t want it stolen, don’t be a braggart"
19-04-2020T22:17:38,AspiringNoodle,"Because otherwise that dumdum is going to jail, plus will have a lot of their rights revoked, lol"
19-04-2020T22:23:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I hope whoever snapped it up can run like hell and haul ass like he got 4 legs

19-04-2020T23:23:18,AspiringNoodle,Not sure if doubling my hourly rate at the station would be enough for me to stick around xD
19-04-2020T23:23:39,AspiringNoodle,Oh who am I kidding... I'd abuse the hell out of that...
19-04-2020T23:24:05,AspiringNoodle,"Also, I have one former coworker who should've taken a coffee subsitution break :P"
