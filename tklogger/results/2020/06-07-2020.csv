06-07-2020T01:11:46,Dadrobit,"Yeah, Tom has his birthday something like a week after mine."
06-07-2020T01:18:25,Dadrobit,"Yep, 28th. I'm 22nd and Mihari was the 4th. Feel like I'm missing someone though..."
06-07-2020T01:19:54,AspiringNoodle,Hmmmm....
06-07-2020T01:36:33,AspiringNoodle,I'm drawing a blank too
06-07-2020T01:47:12,SpazztasticKiwi,got my hair wrapped up after washing it & Bagheera hops on the bed and starts mesmerizingly clawing at it
06-07-2020T02:24:37,SpazztasticKiwi,dadro have you heard of the applause challenge with dogs
06-07-2020T02:34:50,Dadrobit,Can't say I have?
06-07-2020T02:39:39,SpazztasticKiwi,you clap for your dog and watch the reaction

06-07-2020T02:56:26,Dadrobit,Oreo would be a very confused doggo. I use snaps and claps for nonverbal commands.

06-07-2020T15:21:11,AspiringNoodle,Love the consistency in sketches
06-07-2020T15:21:25,AspiringNoodle,"My noodle brain didn't notice the first time, but that is definitely Laura's setup"
06-07-2020T15:22:06,AspiringNoodle,"Dadro, you remember who had the other birthday this month?"
06-07-2020T15:49:23,qwe304,Has Tom given any updates on artbook #2?
06-07-2020T15:49:44,qwe304,I remember him telling about it months back but haven't heard anything since.
06-07-2020T15:50:17,CrRAR,"He said he ""had"" one planned at one point."
06-07-2020T15:51:08,CrRAR,"Probably between sketches, color art, and remastering the Volumes' covers he's probably too busy."
06-07-2020T15:52:01,AspiringNoodle,Tom's a busy boi
06-07-2020T15:52:18,AspiringNoodle,But I imagine it's so fulfilling~
06-07-2020T15:55:09,qwe304,"alright thanks, I didn't remember hearing anything new about it so wanted to make sure I hadn't missed anything"
06-07-2020T15:58:33,AspiringNoodle,"Oh boy, time to die playing Soma"
06-07-2020T15:58:46,AspiringNoodle,I'm playing in wuss mode but I've heard that even then it's downright frightening
06-07-2020T16:05:14,Mediawatcher,I always wonder how close we are to the end of the comic
06-07-2020T16:05:24,Mediawatcher,It seems like we‚Äôre near the end
06-07-2020T16:09:30,AspiringNoodle,"Nah, we gonna need at least 30 more years c:"
06-07-2020T16:10:32,Mediawatcher,"If that‚Äôs true I‚Äôll be happy, even though it‚Äôs been going for a while I wouldn‚Äôt mind having another 20 years of twokinds comics"
06-07-2020T16:10:47,Mediawatcher,I‚Äôm just not ready to say goodbye to the characters yet
06-07-2020T16:11:57,AspiringNoodle,Maybe we'll get a Boruto style continuation :ptv-laugh:
06-07-2020T16:12:17,Mediawatcher,Oh god that‚Äôll be the day! ü§£
06-07-2020T16:12:32,Mediawatcher,Where we follow the son!
06-07-2020T16:22:46,AspiringNoodle,Or daughter ;)
06-07-2020T16:23:11,AspiringNoodle,Maybe twins! :ptv-excited:
06-07-2020T16:23:19,Mediawatcher,I‚Äôd love that!
06-07-2020T16:23:46,Mediawatcher,A son and a daughter! One human and one keidran!
06-07-2020T16:24:03,AspiringNoodle,I think the child is going to be a cross-breed
06-07-2020T16:24:10,Mediawatcher,Shouldn‚Äôt think about it po much and just enjoy the comic
06-07-2020T16:24:18,Mediawatcher,Too much
06-07-2020T16:25:15,Mediawatcher,"Can‚Äôt wait to see what the child looks like, he/she is gonna be adorable!"
06-07-2020T16:26:16,AspiringNoodle,I'm trying to remember which mask controls Keidran...
06-07-2020T16:26:29,AspiringNoodle,They mentioned that they were going to do something that they hadn't in a long time
06-07-2020T16:26:50,AspiringNoodle,"Rather, they were going to allow something.  In this case, I think they mean a crossbreed child"
06-07-2020T16:27:02,Mediawatcher,I think that was euphremal
06-07-2020T16:27:11,AspiringNoodle,ephemeral

06-07-2020T16:40:00,AspiringNoodle,Apparently the US may be considering banning TikTok...
06-07-2020T16:40:18,AspiringNoodle,"First thought: ""Weird flex... but okay, let's see where this goes."""
06-07-2020T16:40:54,AspiringNoodle,"Second thought: ""Then again... young people are becoming addicted to social media, and a lot of the extremism we see popping up in recent years is in part due to social media."""

06-07-2020T21:39:17,AspiringNoodle,There's some banter about Indians (native americans) believing that cameras would steal their soul
06-07-2020T21:39:41,AspiringNoodle,"I get my brain scanned, next thing I know, I'm waking up in a different room, in a different chair, there's robots, and I'm underwater"
