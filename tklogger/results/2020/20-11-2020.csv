20-11-2020T00:25:28,SageSaga,dont call it a recommendation please XD
20-11-2020T00:25:39,BadFoMo,What was it?
20-11-2020T00:25:41,Dadrobit,"I'm not entirely sold on the premise to the point of continuing past the first book yet, but I'll at least finish this one."
20-11-2020T00:25:44,Dadrobit,Lmao

20-11-2020T00:27:14,Dadrobit,"It's been kinda hard to get through so far. The anime it's being a parody of so far is not one I've watched, so a lot is just... Lost on me."
20-11-2020T00:27:25,SageSaga,exactly
20-11-2020T00:27:42,Dadrobit,Protagonist just reached Nowhere though for reference.
20-11-2020T00:27:52,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
20-11-2020T00:28:07,BadFoMo,What's the book and what's it about?
20-11-2020T00:29:22,SageSaga,its about a guy who wishes he could be in a power fantasy and his wish is granted by the flying spaghetti monster
20-11-2020T00:29:37,Inscrutable,"Wow, truth in title"
20-11-2020T00:29:39,BadFoMo,...Ok. Thanks.
20-11-2020T00:29:46,CrRAR,an ACTUAL flying spaghetti monster?
20-11-2020T00:30:04,SageSaga,THE flying spaghetti monster
20-11-2020T00:30:07,Inscrutable,Did you miss that tidbit of internet meme lore?
20-11-2020T00:30:23,Dadrobit,Guy is transported to hentai parody versions of anime world's where he gets to play as a protagonist. Book uses hard RPG systems for everything.
20-11-2020T00:30:24,Inscrutable,"Not judgementally, just in the sense of how much of an explanation do you want"
20-11-2020T00:30:36,CrRAR,nooo I was just confused if it was like a euphemism for a plot device
20-11-2020T00:30:54,CrRAR,I know of THE flying spaghetti monster xD

20-11-2020T00:32:56,Dadrobit,"It's kinda fascinating, Sage. I thought the RPG systems in the Aether's Revival series was just kind of a quirk of a self-published author trying to be overly specific in their writing. But this stuff actually just being its own genre is news to me."
20-11-2020T00:32:59,BadFoMo,"Oh come on, Picarto, you were behaving so well!"
20-11-2020T00:33:00,KeefMcDerpface,Picarto's back to its shenanigans again.
20-11-2020T00:33:03,SageSaga,time for Picarto to go out again

20-11-2020T00:33:56,SageSaga,Dadrobit- its 100% a thing- its LitRPG and there are a lot that do very VERY hard RPG elements
20-11-2020T00:34:10,Creativegalaxy,"this been happening in other streams i went to,what`s going on?"
20-11-2020T00:34:11,SageSaga,Aether was actually very light on it

20-11-2020T00:35:02,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I had to look into it after I started reading Power Fantasy. I was like, no way it's a coincidence both of these series are leaning so heavily on hard systems."

20-11-2020T00:36:07,Ordithus,hi moon!
20-11-2020T00:36:08,SageSaga,i think im more a fan of the lighter LitRPG stories- but - for like crazy game breaking stuff i like the numbers

20-11-2020T00:36:33,Dadrobit,"And yeah, I think I won't be actively seeking out these litRPG books very much. But Aether's Revival was light enough that I'll still keep up with that one."
20-11-2020T00:37:01,SageSaga,"like ""Wait- i can stack these buffs- omg- before battle im gonna eat this apple- use this potion- use these eye drops- then cast this buff- OMG IM A MONSTER"

20-11-2020T00:38:01,SageSaga,cheese wheels were inefficient
20-11-2020T00:38:08,Ordithus,but delicious!
20-11-2020T00:38:16,SageSaga,true
20-11-2020T00:39:42,Dadrobit,"Hard systems read to me, like the author wishes they could be a game developer, and writing a book was their compromise at getting close to that."
20-11-2020T00:41:32,Dadrobit,"In my opinion, hard systems work great for stuff like DnD and video games because you get to actively participate and use them. But in books, I think they too often drag on and get in the way of the plot."

20-11-2020T02:38:33,CrRAR,what were they making?
20-11-2020T02:39:01,Dadrobit,"It was patisserie week. So fine detail, beautiful bakes."
20-11-2020T02:39:37,CrRAR,"Dang right, gotta get dat consistency with batches of stuff"
20-11-2020T02:40:20,Dadrobit,"I'm personally rooting for the person who took the Star Baker title this week, so I was happy with that. But the elimination of the other person felt bad. They'd been doing so well up to the last moment."
20-11-2020T02:40:45,Dadrobit,"And next week is the finals, so they were thiiiiis close."
20-11-2020T03:00:50,CrRAR,"Yeah, it's a shame because under a time limit getting something perfect especially baking you're unfamiliar with can be down to a tiny miscalculation of technique just done slightly wrong."
20-11-2020T03:01:23,CrRAR,especially in multi-stage recipes
20-11-2020T03:02:04,CrRAR,Nailed the cake layers: botched the whipped cream or icing or whatever.
20-11-2020T03:03:05,CrRAR,"I think I once saw one of those, and getting the fillings right proved difficult with some sort of cake"
20-11-2020T03:03:33,CrRAR,some came out too runny
20-11-2020T03:04:29,SpazztasticKiwi,dude was freakshow for danny phantom
20-11-2020T03:04:38,CrRAR,Ohhh
20-11-2020T03:04:58,CrRAR,wow retro cameo
20-11-2020T03:05:41,CrRAR,that's always cool seeing someone in a bigger role later and learning all the smallers stuff they been apart of before that
20-11-2020T03:06:13,CrRAR,"Like ""Oh, it's THAT guy"""
20-11-2020T03:06:28,CrRAR,:ptv-dealwithit::point_right:
20-11-2020T03:07:26,SpazztasticKiwi,he sounds familiar like how ron pearlman narrated 1000 ways to die and did mr lancer in danny phantom
20-11-2020T03:07:41,SpazztasticKiwi,plus something in blade and tangled
20-11-2020T03:10:15,SpazztasticKiwi,mark hamils also in dp but I know him from avatar
20-11-2020T03:11:11,CrRAR,"huh, he did seem to have quite the voice acting career beforehand."
20-11-2020T03:11:17,SpazztasticKiwi,and taylor lautner was in it apparently..
20-11-2020T03:11:20,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it was unfortunate. It was down to the consistent person, and another person who consistently did ""meh"" bakes but would clutch out at the last moment with something good."
20-11-2020T03:11:52,CrRAR,"yeah, Mark Hammel is quite the prolific voice actor."
20-11-2020T03:12:19,Dadrobit,And it happened again where the last moment clutch bake wasn't even all that great. But the consistent baker's last name was kind of a tragedy.
20-11-2020T03:12:33,Dadrobit,Last bake*
20-11-2020T03:12:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve heard this jon cryer guy somewhere else I swear
20-11-2020T03:12:36,CrRAR,yeah baking is so much more like a science
20-11-2020T03:13:16,Dadrobit,They've had scientist bakers before actually. They usually make it to the last quarter or so.
20-11-2020T03:13:29,CrRAR,not from two and a half men? I would just look at his imdb roles list.
20-11-2020T03:13:51,CrRAR,"lol, lotta science, lil bit of art to it too"

20-11-2020T03:14:56,Dadrobit,"Ughhhh, I'm actually kinda salty about it, ngl."
20-11-2020T03:15:57,Dadrobit,Literally half of the entire contest this person has been on the bottom of all the bakes and barely makes it through each week. Now they're in the final...
20-11-2020T03:16:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I looked - nothing else is familiar
20-11-2020T03:16:50,SpazztasticKiwi,but I did spot that butch hartman did something with Thomas Sanders
20-11-2020T03:17:01,CrRAR,"Like cooking chefs get to do things by taste lots of times, but baker's don't have that kind of immediate feedback like that"
20-11-2020T03:17:14,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s listed in Sanders Sides
20-11-2020T03:17:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll go back to my obsessive binge streaming of phantom boy
20-11-2020T03:17:56,Dadrobit,"Yeah, that's a big thing. Delicate flavors can get lost really easy. Or something can accidentally get super overpowering."
20-11-2020T03:18:03,CrRAR,"They mix a bunch of things and gotta judge blindly, when the component parts can many times just not be remotely edible on their own."
20-11-2020T03:18:04,Dadrobit,o/ spazz
20-11-2020T03:18:20,CrRAR,Ok :v: spazz!
20-11-2020T03:18:53,CrRAR,that was one of the series toward the end of the great Nickelodeon era
20-11-2020T03:19:28,SpazztasticKiwi,no kidding
20-11-2020T03:19:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve already gone on a generator Rex & static shock spiel
20-11-2020T03:20:31,Dadrobit,"I didn't get to watch a lot of TV as a kid, but when I did, I was mostly on Cartoon Network and Toonami."
20-11-2020T03:20:49,Dadrobit,Nickelodeon a teensy bit as a young child.
20-11-2020T03:21:10,Dadrobit,Like Blues Clues and Bear in the Big Blue House.
20-11-2020T03:21:13,CrRAR,It helped I feel like that graphically Danny Phantom looks like Fairly Odd Parents.
20-11-2020T03:21:26,CrRAR,good times
20-11-2020T03:21:30,SpazztasticKiwi,butch harman created both
20-11-2020T03:21:35,SpazztasticKiwi,hartman
20-11-2020T03:21:38,CrRAR,yis
20-11-2020T03:22:00,SpazztasticKiwi,bruh I tell you what it might be I liked those characters when I was younger
20-11-2020T03:22:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I was younger than them in cannon when I saw the cartoons but man
20-11-2020T03:22:34,CrRAR,"xD I feel like ""Gooood timesss"" was a classic Cosmo catchphrase for some reason."
20-11-2020T03:22:52,SpazztasticKiwi,if you keep up the timeline and age them to modern times
20-11-2020T03:23:06,SpazztasticKiwi,give me a 25 year old Danny
20-11-2020T03:23:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"but like Static, he is taken in cannon"
20-11-2020T03:24:38,CrRAR,haha
20-11-2020T03:25:12,SpazztasticKiwi,soooooo that leaves Rex - ~16 last time anything of his aired and that would make him 23ish
20-11-2020T03:27:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I had a small issue with Static shock because he goes into the future at one point to help his future self
20-11-2020T03:27:31,SpazztasticKiwi,which is +40 years to his 14/15
20-11-2020T03:27:47,Dadrobit,Ed Edd and Eddie aged up is kind of a thing I found. YouTube is a wonderous place.
20-11-2020T03:27:53,SpazztasticKiwi,if you try telling me that’s a 40-50 year old man in that episode you’re lying to me
20-11-2020T03:28:32,CrRAR,"huh, Jk Simmons and John Dimaggio (Bender voice) were in generator rex."
20-11-2020T03:29:06,Dadrobit,https://youtu.be/6kPLMZ-kv_I
20-11-2020T03:29:51,Dadrobit,Double D's got a flow
20-11-2020T03:30:23,SpazztasticKiwi,oh and let’s not forget that bucko that takes Static to the future decides to drop the “oh and you have a son” bomb on a 14 year old boy
20-11-2020T03:30:52,CrRAR,haha
20-11-2020T03:31:09,SpazztasticKiwi,poor kid falls off his hover board
20-11-2020T03:31:44,SpazztasticKiwi,several hundred feet in the air
20-11-2020T03:32:19,CrRAR,time travel be dangerous
20-11-2020T03:32:44,CrRAR,afterall
20-11-2020T03:33:29,CrRAR,luckily I guess you know he doesn't die cuz the son wouldn't have existed.
20-11-2020T03:34:11,CrRAR,Unless they go the back to the future logic of like slow vanishings
20-11-2020T03:36:06,SpazztasticKiwi,nah SS & DP wrap up all their future time travel shenanigans in a bow so everything works out in the end
20-11-2020T03:36:20,SpazztasticKiwi,all three shows should’ve gone on longer

20-11-2020T03:38:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t see how Danny gets in that fight with Teknus possessing a razor
20-11-2020T03:38:37,SpazztasticKiwi,and screams he’s too young to shave at 14

20-11-2020T13:51:01,Roughlandin,Valid question. The sway of the nug is powerful
20-11-2020T13:51:35,AspiringNoodle,I have... on more than one occasion... gotten 20 nugs and just had that for dinner :ptv-uneasy:
20-11-2020T13:52:29,Roughlandin,The nug is versatile. It can be both side and entree
20-11-2020T13:52:53,Roughlandin,And dessert if you're hungry and creative enough
20-11-2020T14:14:27,AspiringNoodle,"Ngl, junkfood being the cheapest / most bountiful blessing ever"
20-11-2020T14:14:32,AspiringNoodle,"Also curse, lol"
20-11-2020T14:17:25,Ordithus,I don't think I've had chicken nuggets since I was in college. Maybe longer
20-11-2020T14:21:08,AspiringNoodle,"I get them every so often.  Also, I can top that"
20-11-2020T14:21:22,AspiringNoodle,"I didn't have KFC OR Taco bell until I was IN college.  And that was like 3+ years in, lol"
20-11-2020T14:23:43,Ordithus,I think I have been to taco bell twice
20-11-2020T14:23:45,Ordithus,ever
20-11-2020T14:24:04,Ordithus,I like mexican and tex-mex. I don't like taco bell
20-11-2020T14:49:21,CrRAR,"same here, maybe like 6 time in my life, but cheesy gordita crunches are amazing"
20-11-2020T14:49:51,CrRAR,course you can make a damn good like chrunchy cheesy taco salad type thing at home too
20-11-2020T14:55:08,Roughlandin,You merely adopted the Bell. I was born to it. Molded by it. I didn't see a real corn tortilla until I was a man!
20-11-2020T14:57:06,Roughlandin,"For real though. I love taco bell, but I'd never dare call it mexican. Not even tex mex"
20-11-2020T14:59:59,Roughlandin,There's a place around my house that makes the best chicken mole I've ever had. Comparing that to Taco Bell is like comparing a triple prime Kobe ribeye to a McD's quarter pounder lol
20-11-2020T15:01:11,BadFoMo,Yo.
20-11-2020T15:01:20,SageSaga,yo
20-11-2020T15:01:23,Ordithus,:csagesaga-c3: yo!
20-11-2020T15:01:28,Roughlandin,Yo ho
20-11-2020T15:02:07,Ordithus,This is unusual - only seeing the page after it was sketched!
20-11-2020T15:02:30,SageSaga,i was so exhausted last night i had to go to bed
20-11-2020T15:02:36,SageSaga,so i didnt finish inking
20-11-2020T15:02:52,Roughlandin,Artists sleep?
20-11-2020T15:03:01,Ordithus,Understandable. Sleep well?
20-11-2020T15:03:02,SageSaga,urge to ban rising
20-11-2020T15:03:09,BadFoMo,Haha!
20-11-2020T15:03:13,SageSaga,yeah slept surprisingly well
20-11-2020T15:03:21,BadFoMo,Good!
20-11-2020T15:03:22,Ordithus,Nice!
20-11-2020T15:12:45,AspiringNoodle,"No, don't ban the Rough D:"
20-11-2020T15:13:35,CrRAR,most excellent
20-11-2020T15:13:55,AspiringNoodle,He's useful as a target :ptv-snicker:
20-11-2020T15:14:40,AspiringNoodle,"Oh yeah, F5, doi"
20-11-2020T15:16:20,Ordithus,Wind walk is an interesting spell. Speedy!
20-11-2020T15:17:04,Ordithus,Highway driving speeds
20-11-2020T15:19:21,SageSaga,is better in Rune Aria than it is in most games
20-11-2020T15:19:45,SageSaga,as will be explained- in the text on wednesday XD
20-11-2020T15:19:57,Ordithus,:eyes: neat
20-11-2020T15:20:45,SageSaga,i can say- it was modified by the developers to make the travel more interesting and faster to make it a more useful spell
20-11-2020T15:21:03,SageSaga,as just walking in the air might be faster since straight lines- its boring
20-11-2020T15:22:47,Ordithus,"Oh yeah, with it being a game being played in real time, it pays to make the travel fun"
20-11-2020T15:23:00,Ordithus,Can't so easily hand wave 8 hours like in dnd
20-11-2020T15:23:02,SpazztasticKiwi,one tray & 2 3 pound bucket orders in the same hour later...
20-11-2020T15:24:54,Roughlandin,The magical equivalent of one of those moving sidewalks at the airport. Way more fun than they should be
20-11-2020T15:31:42,CrRAR,:thinking: bucket... of cake?
20-11-2020T15:31:51,SpazztasticKiwi,chicken
20-11-2020T15:32:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"“I want a pick three bucket with buffalo wings, hot wings, and ranch wings”"

20-11-2020T15:32:52,SpazztasticKiwi,“the buffalo wings and the hot wings are the same thing”
20-11-2020T15:32:54,Roughlandin,The tru tru KFC
20-11-2020T15:33:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"“oh ok just give me the buffalo wings, hot wings, and ranch wings then”"
20-11-2020T15:33:21,SpazztasticKiwi,....
20-11-2020T15:33:38,SpazztasticKiwi,she repeated this four times
20-11-2020T15:33:46,Roughlandin,The customer is always right. Even when they're kinda dumb
20-11-2020T15:33:57,Roughlandin,Or completely wrong
20-11-2020T15:34:12,Roughlandin,...I'm really glad I don't work in the service industry anymore
20-11-2020T15:35:45,SageSaga,the customer is always right is a claim used to make customers feel special - but its actually a backhanded comment
20-11-2020T15:36:23,SageSaga,"it basically really means ""The customer isnt worth our time arguing with"""
20-11-2020T15:37:47,SageSaga,"so when a customer says ""Hey now! I thought the customer was always right!"" its just a reminder ""This person isnt worth our time"""
20-11-2020T15:38:14,Roughlandin,"To be fair, they typically weren't."
20-11-2020T15:39:14,Roughlandin,Echange money for goods. Say as little as possible in doing it. The golden standard for modern services
20-11-2020T15:39:14,AspiringNoodle,I love customers who speak at a barely audible level in a loud building
20-11-2020T15:39:29,AspiringNoodle,"And then insult you for not understanding what they say, and every time it's been old white guys"

20-11-2020T15:40:24,Roughlandin,Even better when they can't bother to get off the phone long enough to make their purchase
20-11-2020T15:40:44,SageSaga,we need Mindflayers working at mc donalds
20-11-2020T15:41:00,AspiringNoodle,I also had one customer be not-so-subtly racist / rude about another patron
20-11-2020T15:41:10,SageSaga,"""You want a number 6, got it, now pay with currency or i shall consume your brain"""
20-11-2020T15:41:17,AspiringNoodle,And acted like an idiot when I refused to go along with it / acted like he didn't say those things.
20-11-2020T15:41:27,AspiringNoodle,acted like I was an idiot*
20-11-2020T15:41:29,Roughlandin,Overtly racist customers? Nooooooo
20-11-2020T15:42:01,AspiringNoodle,"Seriously, any time I've been insulted, directly or off-handedly, by a customer, it's been some old white guy in his 60's or later"
20-11-2020T15:42:25,AspiringNoodle,"It's like, ""I have a college degree and this is a stepping stone job, but sure, insult my intelligence you racist douche."""
20-11-2020T15:43:10,Roughlandin,"Oh I loved those people. ""You dumb?"" You'd better hope not! I just filled your heart medicine."
20-11-2020T15:43:50,Roughlandin,"""What took so long?"" Oh, not much, just making sure you don't die when you take this."
20-11-2020T15:44:27,Roughlandin,That and you didn't give me your current insurance card... again.
20-11-2020T15:44:34,AspiringNoodle,"Also, it's not like I'm trying to be inattentive with what they're saying.  I've just got to keep track of so much stuff"
20-11-2020T15:45:08,Roughlandin,Plus stores are typically loud
20-11-2020T15:45:24,SageSaga,"""I'm the lawyer for the guy you last talked to and we are going to sue you- not the company but you personally- you wont have anything left by the time I'm through with you"" ""Sir, if you are a lawyer then you know there are protections for employees-"""

20-11-2020T15:47:42,Roughlandin,When has reality ever stopped a customer from demanding you give them what they want?

20-11-2020T15:48:14,AspiringNoodle,Society would improve 10x if every company agreed to just toss out idiots who are causing problems
20-11-2020T15:48:56,Roughlandin,True. But those idiots have money. And the company doesn't have to deal with them. You do
20-11-2020T15:49:33,SageSaga,"""Is your manager there yet?"" ""Yes Sir - here she is"" ""STOP HARASSING MY EMPLOYEE! WE DONT NEED YOUR BUSINESS SO SHUT UP AND STOP CALLING!"" ""W-What?! I- I never! How Dare!-*click*"""

20-11-2020T15:50:27,Roughlandin,Checks out lol

20-11-2020T15:51:28,SageSaga,the people that guy was calling for came in again thinking by now their goon had gotten them a room by now
20-11-2020T15:52:06,Roughlandin,"I don't know, noods. I've had some people give some PRETTY unrealistic excuses for why I should give them their drugs early"
20-11-2020T15:52:07,SageSaga,"and the manager was like ""please provide your reservation number"" and finally we got them to show their email and it was like ""As you can see- that hotel name is not our hotel- we are booked solid"""
20-11-2020T15:52:08,AspiringNoodle,Please tell me your manager told them to leave or she would call the cops

20-11-2020T15:54:15,Roughlandin,Hi Grip
20-11-2020T15:54:15,AspiringNoodle,Hi grip
20-11-2020T15:55:05,SageSaga,yo Grip
20-11-2020T15:55:34,BadFoMo,Yo.
20-11-2020T15:56:21,SageSaga,years later that manager was fired and got replaced with miss toss under bus
20-11-2020T15:56:45,Roughlandin,"Aka the ""good"" manager, in corporate's eyes"
20-11-2020T15:56:50,AspiringNoodle,"Let me guess, too many customer complaints?"
20-11-2020T15:56:55,SageSaga,every time she or one of her children - that she gave jobs to there - got in trouble she would blame someone else and throw them under the bus
20-11-2020T15:57:11,Roughlandin,Nepotism? What's that?
20-11-2020T15:57:39,SageSaga,yeah- when she tried to throw me under I took the time to prove her false - and then quit
20-11-2020T15:57:59,SageSaga,brb
20-11-2020T15:58:05,AspiringNoodle,The problem with any corporations or giant businesses is that the higher ups want obedient little worker-monkey drones
20-11-2020T15:58:24,AspiringNoodle,They want people who will bend over backwards to make them as much money as possible.
20-11-2020T15:58:44,AspiringNoodle,Not those who are actually good people and will stick up for their employees and treat customers appropriately
20-11-2020T15:59:03,Roughlandin,They'd prefer people who come pre-bent if they could get them. Save them the cost of bending
20-11-2020T15:59:22,AspiringNoodle,My current manager is possibly one of those kinds of people
20-11-2020T16:00:00,AspiringNoodle,"I like him, but he is waaaaaay too in-tune with corporate.  This store is critical condition, we can't find anybody to hire, we've had to change how we run stores, and I'm about to leave because of it"
20-11-2020T16:00:22,AspiringNoodle,(I'm currently reading legal term stuff for DoorDash before applying)
20-11-2020T16:01:17,SageSaga,get this- they tried to say i was using the owners wifes personal credit card
20-11-2020T16:01:17,Roughlandin,"Sounds like exactly why I left my last job. I liked my pharmacy manager, but corporate kept cutting man-hours to the point that it was unsafe"
20-11-2020T16:01:35,AspiringNoodle,"But he keeps going off about how if we nail the mystery shop score (4 - 5 times a month, at that), then we can get up to an extra $2 per hour for all the hours worked that month."
20-11-2020T16:01:45,Roughlandin,"Well that seems like an easy thing to disprove, Sage. Uh... No I wasn't"
20-11-2020T16:02:32,AspiringNoodle,This is gonna be good
20-11-2020T16:03:07,Roughlandin,"Either way, if you were going to embezzle, at least you'd embezzle some nice stuff"

20-11-2020T16:12:57,SageSaga,so i legit left the job even though i was the current best employee
20-11-2020T16:13:30,Ordithus,Turns out they did not deserve you
20-11-2020T16:13:34,AspiringNoodle,"Don't blame you.  They fired a good manager and got a shitty replacement, just like they wanted"
20-11-2020T16:14:07,Roughlandin,Bad managers will soon be left with only bad employees
20-11-2020T16:14:09,AspiringNoodle,"Well now they have to suffer the consequences.  New manager cost them an employee (or employees), caused damage to the company, and now they'll have to hire ANOTHER manager"

20-11-2020T16:15:28,AspiringNoodle,"I'm not happy with my shifts at the gas station.  I don't know if it's my manager's fault, or if it's corporate's fault, but many balls were dropped for the store to get to this bad of a state"

20-11-2020T16:16:01,SageSaga,shes also a personal friend to the owners and thats how she got the job and is keeping it
20-11-2020T16:16:12,Roughlandin,Yep. Bad managers attract bad employees. Then they wonder why they have such high staff turnover
20-11-2020T16:16:34,AspiringNoodle,The store's been struggling to properly staff for a year.  And it's gotten worse since the pandemic started.  And they're only now starting to look into fixing it.
20-11-2020T16:16:53,SageSaga,"talked to the Son of the owner around christmas last year and he was like ""Shes driving the place into the ground and my parents wont do anything because it still pulls in money they dont even need"""

20-11-2020T16:17:22,AspiringNoodle,Makes me think of that nephew from Kitchen Nightmares
20-11-2020T16:17:38,Roughlandin,It's weird that I know the exact episode you're talking about noodle
20-11-2020T16:17:44,Roughlandin,Poor guy
20-11-2020T16:17:45,AspiringNoodle,Older couple had an Italian restaurant they built / opened themselves and ran successfully for decades
20-11-2020T16:18:01,AspiringNoodle,"When they retired, they wanted to hand it off to family."
20-11-2020T16:18:27,AspiringNoodle,"Ofc, their nephew is the laziest / most entitled douche possible, and he managed to run the restaurant into the ground in a few years, to the point where it was about to close."
20-11-2020T16:18:43,AspiringNoodle,"And Rough, am I remember correctly? xD"
20-11-2020T16:18:48,Roughlandin,Oh that episode. I was thinking of the one with the two brothers
20-11-2020T16:19:00,AspiringNoodle,The Twins?
20-11-2020T16:19:28,Roughlandin,Yeah the one who didn't give a damn and the other who was trying to stop the ship from sinking
20-11-2020T16:20:11,Roughlandin,But I remember the nephew one too. He had an alcohol problem too right?
20-11-2020T16:20:32,Roughlandin,He'd show up in the middle of dinner service and hang out behind the bar pouring himself wine
20-11-2020T16:21:17,AspiringNoodle,"Yup, wine-o"
20-11-2020T16:21:19,SageSaga,that sounds made up
20-11-2020T16:21:25,SageSaga,like made for TV
20-11-2020T16:21:56,AspiringNoodle,"Sadly, no, lol"
20-11-2020T16:22:03,SageSaga,because I find it hard to imagine if two brothers owned a place and one didnt care and the other did- they would just let one brother run it and make money while the other does nothing
20-11-2020T16:22:07,AspiringNoodle,Are you familiar with Gordon Ramsey?
20-11-2020T16:22:20,SageSaga,yeah- he comes off as very fake to me
20-11-2020T16:22:31,AspiringNoodle,"Well, he's still a very successful and world-famous chef"
20-11-2020T16:22:36,SageSaga,i feel like a lot of his stuff is staged
20-11-2020T16:22:43,Roughlandin,A lot of the angry stuff is fake
20-11-2020T16:22:58,SageSaga,yeah- i dont think hes a fake chef XD
20-11-2020T16:23:01,Roughlandin,He's pretty soft spoken on the british version of the show
20-11-2020T16:23:06,AspiringNoodle,Some stuff is probably played up / exaggerated to make it more interesting
20-11-2020T16:23:14,Roughlandin,From what I understand he's actually a pretty nice guy
20-11-2020T16:23:15,SageSaga,but he acts up for the camera
20-11-2020T16:23:20,AspiringNoodle,But the general situations of restaurants is all too real
20-11-2020T16:23:34,AspiringNoodle,"Amy's Baking Company... is still the best episode ever, lmao"
20-11-2020T16:24:00,AspiringNoodle,That place was a literal reality show trying to run as a restaurant
20-11-2020T16:24:01,Roughlandin,"I think they add drama to the show, definitely"
20-11-2020T16:24:01,SageSaga,"he plays a character- i get it- but a lot of those ""save the restaurant"" ""Flip this house"" shows all have staged elements to make them more interesting"
20-11-2020T16:24:36,Roughlandin,"And the ""saving"" is... arguable. A lot of the restaurants still wind up closing after the show leaves"
20-11-2020T16:25:01,Roughlandin,A redecoration and a menu made by a master chef doesn't fix bad management
20-11-2020T16:25:02,SageSaga,well yeah
20-11-2020T16:25:13,AspiringNoodle,Sometimes they were just too far gone to save
20-11-2020T16:25:14,SageSaga,who wants to eat at a place that was once filled with rats?
20-11-2020T16:25:33,Roughlandin,:ptv-grossedout:
20-11-2020T16:25:34,SageSaga,"even if they fixed things - people are gonna be like- ""the people who let that happen are still working here"""
20-11-2020T16:25:39,AspiringNoodle,I can't remember the name of it... but there was a Seafood restaurant in NYC that closed after Ramsey left
20-11-2020T16:25:56,AspiringNoodle,"It had 3 co-owners, 1 of whom was more or less running the place, but he was the problem"
20-11-2020T16:26:08,AspiringNoodle,"As soon as Ramsey left, he undid all the changes and went back to situation normal."
20-11-2020T16:26:25,Roughlandin,"Like I said, can't fix bad management lol"
20-11-2020T16:26:28,AspiringNoodle,"On the bright side, a very good BBQ joint opened in its place"
20-11-2020T16:26:28,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-keifacepalm: did you learn nothing
20-11-2020T16:26:35,SageSaga,exactly
20-11-2020T16:27:59,Roughlandin,The one thing I feel like is real is Gordon's reactions to some of the food he gets served
20-11-2020T16:28:25,Roughlandin,Especially after he inspects the kitchens. It's a wonder he didn't get food poisoning at some of those places
20-11-2020T16:28:34,AspiringNoodle,...don't remind me
20-11-2020T16:28:40,Roughlandin,...Actually I think he did on a couple occasions
20-11-2020T16:28:43,AspiringNoodle,Some of those kitchens were literal Kitchen Nightmares
20-11-2020T16:29:14,Roughlandin,Some of them probably should have been shut down right away
20-11-2020T16:30:04,AspiringNoodle,My favorite episodes are when the head chef can't tell chicken from lamb
20-11-2020T16:30:14,AspiringNoodle,And the chefs serving UNDER them are more knowledgable about cooking
20-11-2020T16:31:13,Roughlandin,Which is why a lot of them wind up leaving and working at better restaurants
20-11-2020T16:33:11,Roughlandin,"Welp, I'm gonna go finish up some school work. Thanks for streaming, Sage! See you Sunday, Noodle/Ord!"
20-11-2020T16:33:13,Roughlandin,o/

20-11-2020T17:31:48,SpazztasticKiwi,lady got some buffalo wings but didn’t tell me until I’d already put some in the container that she only wanted certain  ones
20-11-2020T17:50:20,Ordithus,"a buffalo with wings is so rare, a terrible thing to waste"
