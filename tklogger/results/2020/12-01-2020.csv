12-01-2020T00:22:41,AspiringNoodle,I'm trying to get away from Overwatch
12-01-2020T00:22:46,AspiringNoodle,But the gameplay is too damn satisfying
12-01-2020T00:22:50,AspiringNoodle,"I GOT DARK SOULS TO PLAY, DAMMIT"
12-01-2020T00:34:28,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
12-01-2020T00:34:34,JojoF2415,Geometry dash is a fun game
12-01-2020T00:34:56,JojoF2415,Also a lot frustrating once you get to the harder levels
12-01-2020T00:37:20,JojoF2415,Pokemon and geometry dash are the only games I mostly play
12-01-2020T00:37:37,JojoF2415,Sometimes Minecraft and clash of clans
12-01-2020T00:43:28,SpazztasticKiwi,nibbleh

12-01-2020T00:52:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"but it’s wax clay, which can’t be fired"
12-01-2020T00:53:33,SpazztasticKiwi,so I have to either seal in in resin or find a varnish to coat it
12-01-2020T00:53:54,SpazztasticKiwi,THATS WHY
12-01-2020T01:18:09,Demianartist,Así que es así

12-01-2020T03:26:51,SpazztasticKiwi,or “working till I faint”
