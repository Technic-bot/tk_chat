29-03-2020T00:48:09,BlackjackSec99,"hey, we of the chat laugh at your humor"
29-03-2020T00:49:30,BlackjackSec99,my boy dog just put his paws on my shoulders because I was giving girl dog scritches....  lol
29-03-2020T00:49:54,SpazztasticKiwi,“I here too”
29-03-2020T00:50:09,BlackjackSec99,basically
29-03-2020T00:50:14,SpazztasticKiwi,& chat people are either too old or too young for me
29-03-2020T00:50:39,BlackjackSec99,"eh, and we are an odd bunch"
29-03-2020T00:51:13,SpazztasticKiwi,besides
29-03-2020T00:51:20,SpazztasticKiwi,*whispers* there’s no such thing as a girl furry
29-03-2020T00:51:27,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s why they’re all single
29-03-2020T00:52:22,BlackjackSec99,"*random group of guys appears chanting ""girl.... girl...girl....girl...""*"
29-03-2020T00:52:34,SpazztasticKiwi,you know what
29-03-2020T00:52:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I can see it happening
29-03-2020T00:53:07,BlackjackSec99,ive watched it happen in some of my automotive forums
29-03-2020T00:53:47,BlackjackSec99,"because a girl who can work on a car is about the same mythical status as a girl furry, or a girl gamer"
29-03-2020T00:54:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I know someone - know he likes me cause he said so in a....uncommon way
29-03-2020T00:54:26,BlackjackSec99,O.o should i be scared?
29-03-2020T00:54:42,BlackjackSec99,or have a facepalm ready?
29-03-2020T00:54:50,SpazztasticKiwi,as far as I’ve witnessed he mainly has issues controlling his eyes
29-03-2020T00:55:14,BlackjackSec99,"*eyecontact, looks down, eye contact, looks down*"
29-03-2020T00:55:15,BlackjackSec99,?
29-03-2020T00:55:26,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s an ass guy
29-03-2020T00:55:37,BlackjackSec99,ohhhhhhh
29-03-2020T00:55:41,SpazztasticKiwi,and horrible at being sneaky
29-03-2020T00:55:52,BlackjackSec99,"*constant stare*   ""...what?"""
29-03-2020T00:56:20,SpazztasticKiwi,no he’s looking when he thinks I’m not aware
29-03-2020T00:56:32,BlackjackSec99,ahh
29-03-2020T00:56:53,SpazztasticKiwi,peripheral vision is a thing
29-03-2020T00:57:03,BlackjackSec99,"yes, yes it is."
29-03-2020T00:57:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"then again the staring could be because he’s, as he’s said, “tense”"
29-03-2020T00:58:03,SpazztasticKiwi,to say it nicely
29-03-2020T00:58:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"that’s how I learned he liked me, by the way"
29-03-2020T00:58:29,BlackjackSec99,"tense, nervous, or... excited?"
29-03-2020T00:59:21,SpazztasticKiwi,let me be clearer: “....I guess it’s the man in me”
29-03-2020T00:59:49,SpazztasticKiwi,yes he used those words
29-03-2020T01:00:04,BlackjackSec99,O.o thats... thats a really odd way to say youre attracted to someone
29-03-2020T01:00:28,SpazztasticKiwi,he hadn’t been laid in a year and was apparently some sort of lonely
29-03-2020T01:01:22,BlackjackSec99,he was like that after a year? hate to see it after 6....
29-03-2020T01:01:50,SpazztasticKiwi,far as I’m concerned I wasn’t on that path and that interaction cemented what I believe is my final decision on trying a date or not
29-03-2020T01:02:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"if that was all he wanted to be friends for, I’ll pass"
29-03-2020T01:02:17,BlackjackSec99,"yeah, good choice."
29-03-2020T01:02:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"but, I’ve stayed in contact so if he can grow some self control"
29-03-2020T01:02:49,SpazztasticKiwi,we can stay ~just~ friends
29-03-2020T01:03:23,BlackjackSec99,guys have a hard time figuring out what -just-friends with a girl means...
29-03-2020T01:05:53,BlackjackSec99,"well, I do wish you luck in that regard. running across a guy interested in YOU not just your body and what you can do for them."
29-03-2020T01:08:09,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s quiet
29-03-2020T01:08:11,SpazztasticKiwi,calm
29-03-2020T01:08:23,SpazztasticKiwi,just cozied in bed on my phone
29-03-2020T01:08:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera hops up on the bed and now I have a lawnmower in my ear

29-03-2020T01:11:40,SpazztasticKiwi,his whiskers on one side was burned and his face had some scrapes
29-03-2020T01:12:04,BlackjackSec99,"ah man, how could someone consider NOT keeping that little fuzzball"
29-03-2020T01:12:15,SpazztasticKiwi,my mom thinks he rode on someone’s car and jumped off when they stopped but I say he was tossed out
29-03-2020T01:12:54,SpazztasticKiwi,we planned to give him to a shelter cause I already have a cat and my mom and sister already have their own too
29-03-2020T01:13:02,SpazztasticKiwi,they never called back
29-03-2020T01:13:04,BlackjackSec99,"*sigh* yeah, could have been tossed, happens too often"
29-03-2020T01:13:16,SpazztasticKiwi,black cats aren’t adoptable
29-03-2020T01:13:26,AspiringNoodle,BULL. SHIT.

29-03-2020T01:14:06,SpazztasticKiwi,he’d started sleeping on my bed anyway so he became mine
29-03-2020T01:14:11,AspiringNoodle,I remember the surge in black cat adoptions after Black Panther came out...
29-03-2020T01:14:21,AspiringNoodle,"Pffft, posers.  I liked black cats before it was cool -3-"
29-03-2020T01:14:24,BlackjackSec99,"depends on the area noodle. some places are fine, but others, well, some are just killed outright, or tortured and killed, sometimes they are used in cult rituals."
29-03-2020T01:14:37,SpazztasticKiwi,and now I can’t so much as go to the bathroom right next door to my room without him at my heels
29-03-2020T01:14:41,AspiringNoodle,"If I get a black cat, I'm naming them Salem :D"

29-03-2020T01:15:54,JojoF2415,I couldn’t have one until almost a year ago
29-03-2020T01:15:57,AspiringNoodle,"Not that they're against it, but the house is a mess :c"

29-03-2020T01:16:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"the guy I mentioned, said me he didn’t like cats at all but I told him I had two and it’s “cats are cool”"
29-03-2020T01:16:27,JojoF2415,I always liked cats than dogs
29-03-2020T01:16:50,BlackjackSec99,"oh geez, one of those?"

29-03-2020T01:18:46,BlackjackSec99,"oooo yeah, smart pets are awesome/a nightmare"
29-03-2020T01:18:47,SpazztasticKiwi,those glasses are from a teddy bear and all it took was “I wonder...”

29-03-2020T16:01:00,SpazztasticKiwi,dude has gotten semi better at washing his hands
29-03-2020T16:01:07,SpazztasticKiwi,but he’s had to be reminded
29-03-2020T16:01:37,AspiringNoodle,"At the station, I more or less wash my hands hourly, sometimes more"
29-03-2020T16:01:59,AspiringNoodle,"Sometimes within 10 minutes of each other, lol."
29-03-2020T16:02:16,AspiringNoodle,"There are times where I'll JUST wash my hands, and then something pops up that'll require me to wash them again"
29-03-2020T16:02:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"new complaint is as he was breaking down boxes, he was swinging a pair of scissors around his finger"
29-03-2020T16:02:36,AspiringNoodle,>_>
29-03-2020T16:02:47,BlackjackSec99,my hands are like the atacama desert with how much im washing them... super dried out now... like old leather thats been left outside
29-03-2020T16:03:23,SpazztasticKiwi,you’re not using enough lotion then
29-03-2020T16:03:29,BlackjackSec99,"whats he think he is, a shinobi from Naruto?"
29-03-2020T16:03:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t care what he thinks he is
29-03-2020T16:03:48,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s an idiot
29-03-2020T16:03:53,BlackjackSec99,"Okeefs working hands, every night"
29-03-2020T16:04:04,BlackjackSec99,"lol yes, thats an agreement"
29-03-2020T16:04:10,SpazztasticKiwi,this isn’t kindergarten why are you playing with scissors
29-03-2020T16:04:40,SpazztasticKiwi,and it’s not like he’s necessarily bad
29-03-2020T16:05:08,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s just got some ticks that need a firm wap from a sandal
29-03-2020T16:05:26,BlackjackSec99,the ole chankla?
29-03-2020T16:05:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"or a two by four, whatever works"
29-03-2020T16:06:07,BlackjackSec99,"dunno, one of my friends moms is DEADLY with that chankla...."
29-03-2020T16:06:18,BlackjackSec99,*has flashbacks*
29-03-2020T16:07:17,SpazztasticKiwi,my manager told us a story about her little son
29-03-2020T16:07:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"since he’s out of school, he’s either on his games or outside until past dark and has to be pulled inside"
29-03-2020T16:08:16,SpazztasticKiwi,but one day he comes in and “mommy I think my head is bleeding” completely casual
29-03-2020T16:08:25,BlackjackSec99,....uh oh
29-03-2020T16:09:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"sure enough, he’s been outside playing with his bike or something, decided to ride with his feet on the seat instead of his butt, and fell into her car"
29-03-2020T16:09:06,SpazztasticKiwi,got his head and arm
29-03-2020T16:09:32,SpazztasticKiwi,then played some more till he was done and came inside to tell mom
29-03-2020T16:09:38,BlackjackSec99,little stunt man. would have fit right in with me and my crew lol
29-03-2020T16:09:45,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s 5
29-03-2020T16:10:05,BlackjackSec99,my comment stands. we were kinda crazy on wheels.
29-03-2020T16:11:37,BlackjackSec99,soooo what happened?
29-03-2020T16:11:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a feeling she’s gonna have ten tons of fun once this second boy is born and gets old enough to follow this first one around
29-03-2020T16:12:08,SpazztasticKiwi,he was fine - just cuts maybe bruises
29-03-2020T16:13:04,BlackjackSec99,"hahaha yeah, the second one is usually the crazier one... My son is older, he just hauls ass on his electric dirt bike, my daughter who is 10 months and 3 weeks younger does tricks on said bike..."
29-03-2020T16:13:10,BlackjackSec99,ahh thats good
29-03-2020T16:15:00,SpazztasticKiwi,she’s finally decided she’s taking her maternity leave
29-03-2020T16:15:45,BlackjackSec99,that far along then?
29-03-2020T16:16:31,SpazztasticKiwi,due in a month or two but I’m not sure
29-03-2020T16:16:46,SpazztasticKiwi,her first didn’t arrive when and how he was supposed to
29-03-2020T16:16:55,BlackjackSec99,oh?
29-03-2020T16:17:59,SpazztasticKiwi,he was on his way to being born normally but it was taking too long so they had to do an emergency c section
29-03-2020T16:18:45,BlackjackSec99,"ohhh thats not so good. once you have one c section, the chances of having to have another go up a LOT"
29-03-2020T16:20:21,SpazztasticKiwi,neither kid was planned at all - she didn’t want kids
29-03-2020T16:21:04,SpazztasticKiwi,so she decided after he first she was done
29-03-2020T16:21:09,BlackjackSec99,"same, actually... never wanted kids. then suprise! and, now I cant really imagine life without them"
29-03-2020T16:21:34,SpazztasticKiwi,and then this second one happened
29-03-2020T16:21:55,BlackjackSec99,lol that happens without protection
29-03-2020T16:21:56,SpazztasticKiwi,now she’s saying she’s getting something done whether it’s an implant or her tubes tied
29-03-2020T16:23:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I looked into getting mine tied my last dr visit
29-03-2020T16:23:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"they told me since I was still unmarried and so young, it likely wouldn’t be approved until I was at least 25"
29-03-2020T16:24:52,BlackjackSec99,ive heard of that. guys get the same talk about vasectomies. mostly because is usually not reversable
29-03-2020T16:25:03,BlackjackSec99,well
29-03-2020T16:25:09,BlackjackSec99,not EASILY reversable
29-03-2020T16:26:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve seen what childbirth is like and I say no thanks
29-03-2020T16:27:32,BlackjackSec99,"eh, depends, really... my daughter was born really easy. practically slid out. my son? not so  much."
29-03-2020T16:28:39,SpazztasticKiwi,my sister and I were born fairly easy
29-03-2020T16:29:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I was out in 2 hours from prelabor to birth a full 6 days early
29-03-2020T16:29:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I was predicted to have the same birthday as my sister
29-03-2020T16:29:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I had other plans
29-03-2020T16:29:58,BlackjackSec99,"lol yeah, my daughter came early too. i think seconds just do that"
29-03-2020T16:30:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean I was also expected to be a boy but
29-03-2020T16:30:58,SpazztasticKiwi,born in the blue and grey room
29-03-2020T16:31:15,tehbear,:kiwi: its a .... kiwi!
29-03-2020T16:31:28,BlackjackSec99,its a bear
29-03-2020T16:31:34,BlackjackSec99,but not a teddy
29-03-2020T16:31:52,SpazztasticKiwi,“surprise - guess again”
29-03-2020T16:31:59,BlackjackSec99,lol
29-03-2020T16:32:01,SpazztasticKiwi,50/50 shot and they still missed
29-03-2020T16:32:27,BlackjackSec99,lol it happens
29-03-2020T16:33:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"they were hoping for a boy cause they already had my sister but as everything passed, my mom became much happier with girls"
29-03-2020T16:34:05,tehbear,opposite here. my parents only got boys.
29-03-2020T16:34:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"as things went downhill with my parents, she predicted I would’ve been a carbon copy of my dad if I’d been a boy"
29-03-2020T16:34:23,BlackjackSec99,am an only....
29-03-2020T16:34:48,BlackjackSec99,"uhhhh possible? my son is a carbon copy of me.... like, its scary...."
29-03-2020T16:35:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m basically my dad - I got more from him than my mom
29-03-2020T16:35:22,BlackjackSec99,"like, i know what hes gonna do before he does it cause its what I would do"
29-03-2020T16:36:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"my mom and sister are almost mirrors of each other but I got his temper, his stubbornness, some of his features to where plenty of people say I look like him"
29-03-2020T16:36:30,SpazztasticKiwi,which is not a compliment
29-03-2020T16:36:33,tehbear,i like to think i got a bit from both sides. but ive been compared to both my grandma and grandfather :ctwokinds-power:
29-03-2020T16:36:46,BlackjackSec99,you and dad dont get along?
29-03-2020T16:37:10,SpazztasticKiwi,oh we got along fine but it was complicated growing up
29-03-2020T16:37:30,SpazztasticKiwi,my parents were close to a divorce right at the end
29-03-2020T16:37:34,BlackjackSec99,separated home?
29-03-2020T16:37:43,SpazztasticKiwi,it almost happened
29-03-2020T16:37:48,SpazztasticKiwi,he died instead
29-03-2020T16:37:54,tehbear,woha
29-03-2020T16:37:57,BlackjackSec99,"...oh shit, im sorry"
29-03-2020T16:38:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"when he was a teen, he got hit by a car"
29-03-2020T16:38:29,SpazztasticKiwi,something changed in his mental state but he was ok
29-03-2020T16:38:46,BlackjackSec99,head injuries tend to do that.....
29-03-2020T16:38:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"when my parents met, he worked hard, and was clean and a great father and husband"
29-03-2020T16:38:59,tehbear,the car accident from the past lead to his death?
29-03-2020T16:39:11,SpazztasticKiwi,but he started drinking again
29-03-2020T16:39:15,tehbear,uh oh
29-03-2020T16:39:27,BlackjackSec99,"ohhhh, i think i see where this is going"
29-03-2020T16:39:36,SpazztasticKiwi,unmanned dumptruck on fire down a hill
29-03-2020T16:39:58,tehbear,seems i jumped into a rather heavy chat
29-03-2020T16:40:22,tehbear,drunks are terrible
29-03-2020T16:40:30,SpazztasticKiwi,my mother hit her breaking point when he started getting more unstable especially towards my sister
29-03-2020T16:40:39,tehbear,worst part is that they dont remember all the things they say & do
29-03-2020T16:40:55,SpazztasticKiwi,she was planning to file for divorce before his drinking and self medicating caught up with him
29-03-2020T16:41:08,BlackjackSec99,liver failure?
29-03-2020T16:41:30,SpazztasticKiwi,no we came home on Halloween after being out because I wanted to trick or treat
29-03-2020T16:41:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"and he was passed out in the car, not breathing well"
29-03-2020T16:42:04,SpazztasticKiwi,mom dropped is off at her moms and drove him to the er
29-03-2020T16:42:18,SpazztasticKiwi,he didn’t come back
29-03-2020T16:42:22,tehbear,...
29-03-2020T16:42:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I was 12
29-03-2020T16:43:06,BlackjackSec99,"thats... kind of terrifying for anyone, let alone 12"
29-03-2020T16:48:54,tehbear,are you ok Kiwi?
29-03-2020T16:49:39,tehbear,i dont know what to say when people recount such things
29-03-2020T16:50:10,BlackjackSec99,I think shes on mobile app cause her name keeps coming and going on the user list
29-03-2020T16:51:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m just on lunch playing games
29-03-2020T16:53:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"which today, we had to throw out the entire discount rack"
29-03-2020T16:53:35,BlackjackSec99,for why?
29-03-2020T16:53:55,SpazztasticKiwi,some lady came in and looked through it hacking and coughing all over the place
