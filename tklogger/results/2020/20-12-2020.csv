20-12-2020T19:32:48,CrRAR,I think it‚Äôs partly because tons of people save their concerns and things for when they have a breather
20-12-2020T19:33:11,CrRAR,but they at least know I have their back all the other times
20-12-2020T19:33:48,CrRAR,Dept budgets just be extra lame so we can‚Äôt plan how we want
20-12-2020T19:34:14,CrRAR,Who knew Mr Krabs was an incredibly realistic business leader

20-12-2020T20:25:43,CrRAR,yeah they do that
20-12-2020T20:37:36,AspiringNoodle,Also my instacart card got delayed by a day
20-12-2020T20:54:08,Dadrobit,"$1000 a month for Tokyo? Shit, Downtown Phx is like $1500."
20-12-2020T20:54:34,Ordithus,yeah that was surprising
20-12-2020T20:57:26,Ordithus,"according to wiki, average wage in the us is quite a bit higher than in japan"
20-12-2020T20:58:38,Ordithus,same with median
20-12-2020T22:19:42,AspiringNoodle,"tbf, there are lots of other things going for Japan that can justify that"
20-12-2020T22:19:45,SpazztasticKiwi,well I heard the weirdest radio ad ever
20-12-2020T22:19:57,AspiringNoodle,Like cars are more of a rarity
20-12-2020T22:20:29,AspiringNoodle,And what was the ad?
20-12-2020T22:21:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"in short, uab is looking for volunteers to do a study"
20-12-2020T22:21:35,SpazztasticKiwi,but their opening line is ‚Äúare you a woman who has sex with men‚Äù
20-12-2020T22:21:48,AspiringNoodle,:|
20-12-2020T22:21:56,AspiringNoodle,That's like 98% of women?
20-12-2020T22:23:14,Rainelover,Does anyone here know by chance why Tom hasn‚Äôt posted today‚Äôs sketch? Did something happen?
20-12-2020T22:24:38,SpazztasticKiwi,sometimes there‚Äôs delays
20-12-2020T22:24:42,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe he forgot
20-12-2020T22:24:47,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs the holidays
20-12-2020T22:24:58,Rainelover,True
20-12-2020T22:25:21,SpazztasticKiwi,uab is looking for active women 18-45 for a study
20-12-2020T22:25:32,SpazztasticKiwi,that was the ad
20-12-2020T22:26:03,Rainelover,Plus he did say he was working on new pages to make up for the ones he missed
20-12-2020T22:26:57,Rainelover,So that could be another reason
20-12-2020T22:27:50,SpazztasticKiwi,ok so my crankgameplays youtooz is due to be here the 23rd
20-12-2020T22:29:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"ever since I ordered it and the markiplier figure - at the same time - and marks arrived almost a month ago, it‚Äôs been delayed another day and another day and another day...."

20-12-2020T22:36:04,AspiringNoodle,My card for Instacart got delayed *I think*
