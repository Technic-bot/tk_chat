20-10-2020T02:01:13,CrRAR,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
20-10-2020T02:02:03,CrRAR,At a certain point it’s worth just staying up till the next day
20-10-2020T02:02:27,CrRAR,Like you try to sleep and you wake up MORE tired
20-10-2020T02:03:33,CrRAR,"Probably go to work early, maybe cut out at noon, my Thursday will be long so w/e"
20-10-2020T02:04:35,CrRAR,Might not have to do anything Friday

20-10-2020T02:06:03,CrRAR,This is how it’s been going lately
20-10-2020T02:07:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m off Thursday but I got work tomorrow
20-10-2020T02:08:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve lit the panda candle today & I can’t say I’m thrilled with the smell
20-10-2020T02:08:46,CrRAR,Is it supposed to be bamboo scented or something?
20-10-2020T02:08:50,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s eucalyptusy/mint like which I mean isn’t Bad but it’s not my favorite
20-10-2020T02:09:14,CrRAR,Probably better for a spa environment
20-10-2020T02:09:20,SpazztasticKiwi,the sakura & libra ones were better
20-10-2020T02:09:43,CrRAR,Is the panda at least cute?
20-10-2020T02:09:58,CrRAR,You know before its face melted off?
20-10-2020T02:10:09,SpazztasticKiwi,they smelled mainly of peach blossoms and they had that in them but the libra had pear and a third note in it
20-10-2020T02:10:22,SpazztasticKiwi,the panda is the actual candle cup
20-10-2020T02:10:38,CrRAR,Ooo mystery ingredient
20-10-2020T02:10:43,CrRAR,Ah i see
20-10-2020T02:11:02,CrRAR,Maybe dragon or passion fruit?
20-10-2020T02:11:17,CrRAR,Or groovy guava~
20-10-2020T02:11:25,SpazztasticKiwi,https://www.fragrantjewels.com/products/panda-monium-jewel-candle
20-10-2020T02:11:49,SpazztasticKiwi,they all have the smells listed I just remember the peach and pear parts
20-10-2020T02:12:09,SpazztasticKiwi,but each one has at least 3 notes to their scent
20-10-2020T02:12:18,CrRAR,:cw0lfmare-EmberO: < panda face
20-10-2020T02:12:24,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s even got a little tail on the back
20-10-2020T02:12:25,CrRAR,basically
20-10-2020T02:12:32,CrRAR,Awww
20-10-2020T02:12:41,CrRAR,Lil poof
20-10-2020T02:13:18,SpazztasticKiwi,the cat one’s the same - these two I’ll have collectible jars that I can keep for other things
20-10-2020T02:13:31,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s got little ears on the jar
20-10-2020T02:14:22,CrRAR,Yeah lil clutter collectors or just good for organization
20-10-2020T02:14:26,SpazztasticKiwi,the libra one I didn’t like when I smelled it straight out of the box but when it burned....all those notes together were amazing
20-10-2020T02:14:50,SpazztasticKiwi,and it had a necklace
20-10-2020T02:15:15,CrRAR,"Yeah sometimes more subtle scents can balance the strong ones, huh?"
20-10-2020T02:15:42,SpazztasticKiwi,my rooms smelled like sweet flowers for days
20-10-2020T02:15:54,SpazztasticKiwi,about 5 days in fact
20-10-2020T02:16:14,CrRAR,"Kinda like cream in chai tea, separates and makes individual flavors stand out"
20-10-2020T02:16:34,CrRAR,Same or reg tea too I guess/any tea
20-10-2020T02:17:08,SpazztasticKiwi,the panda is definitely more for relaxing or quiet time but it’s still pretty nice
20-10-2020T02:17:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll call it worth the price
20-10-2020T02:17:28,SpazztasticKiwi,the sakura one had a sakura inspired ring & the panda one will have a panda inspired ring once it burns low enough
20-10-2020T02:17:51,CrRAR,Yrah mint very good for chillin
20-10-2020T02:18:16,SpazztasticKiwi,same with the cat candle - cat inspired ring & the emerald (May birthstone) candle will have an emerald ring
20-10-2020T02:18:45,SpazztasticKiwi,all the jars will be getting a new life after the candle is gone and cleaned out

20-10-2020T02:21:41,SpazztasticKiwi,it also came with a thank you card for supporting the pandas and from the pandas

20-10-2020T02:25:30,CrRAR,Or just eucalypverous?
20-10-2020T02:25:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m sure they’ve eaten a big or two on the bamboo stalks
20-10-2020T02:25:46,CrRAR,haha
20-10-2020T02:25:49,SpazztasticKiwi,but as far as I know they’re strictly vegetarians
