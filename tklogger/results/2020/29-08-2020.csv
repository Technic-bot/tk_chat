29-08-2020T00:24:14,AspiringNoodle,Am I the only one who thinks eating out (as in literally sitting down at a restaurant) is still a super bad idea?
29-08-2020T00:24:26,AspiringNoodle,Or am I the weird one?

29-08-2020T12:41:36,RimaDraws,i prefer to not think about it
29-08-2020T12:54:29,CrRAR,"I‚Äôd imagine sometime between commiting Rose to the estate and seeking out Maren, Trace must have given up or gotten distracted in pursuit of world domination instead."

29-08-2020T13:01:28,Ordithus,probably was going to bring her after murdering Flora
29-08-2020T13:01:30,RimaDraws,i mean i like trace
29-08-2020T13:01:40,Ordithus,"new, improved Trace"
29-08-2020T13:01:44,RimaDraws,yea
29-08-2020T13:01:49,RimaDraws,new trace is alright but damn
29-08-2020T13:02:00,RimaDraws,old trace i would have said mmm no hit the road or ill shove you into it
29-08-2020T13:02:14,Ordithus,that'd end well
29-08-2020T13:02:52,RimaDraws,well he would get over it or kill me
29-08-2020T13:02:54,RimaDraws,his choice lol
29-08-2020T13:03:20,RimaDraws,old trace would not last in the modern world
29-08-2020T13:03:40,RimaDraws,he would treat one girl bad and it would be all over the internet
29-08-2020T13:03:41,CrRAR,"OldTrace: ‚ÄúI know how much you hate keidran, so here- I brought you this lucky tiger paw~‚Äù"

29-08-2020T13:04:04,RimaDraws,if he treated me bad
29-08-2020T13:04:09,RimaDraws,oh there would be hell to pay
29-08-2020T13:04:53,RimaDraws,and you can ask my bf i am not a woman to take anyone's shit
29-08-2020T13:05:38,CrRAR,"Maren did have slaps for him, so the sentiment is real"
29-08-2020T13:05:42,Ordithus,serve him up a knuckle sandwich
29-08-2020T13:06:46,Ordithus,I've wondered for a while what that relationship even looked like.  The heck did Maren see in him?
29-08-2020T13:07:20,CrRAR,He was the duke guy in the big house everyone probably was curious about
29-08-2020T13:07:34,CrRAR,Maybe she partly thought she could change him?
29-08-2020T13:07:55,Ordithus,Maybe he was sort of normal when not going on murder sprees
29-08-2020T13:08:18,CrRAR,Even Flora was curious about the big house and wondered about living there.
29-08-2020T13:09:23,CrRAR,"Plus, they both share a keidran hatred"
29-08-2020T13:09:30,RimaDraws,well old trace is defo not bf material
29-08-2020T13:09:32,RimaDraws,just a tyrant
29-08-2020T13:09:43,CrRAR,Yeah he was a pychoboy
29-08-2020T13:09:56,Ordithus,abby normal
29-08-2020T13:10:12,CrRAR,I think the overall message is ‚Äògrass is not always greener‚Äô.

29-08-2020T13:11:14,RimaDraws,i mean seriously we've seen this before. beauty and the beast. big place rich guy yea he's a prick
29-08-2020T13:11:29,RimaDraws,can someone different change him maybe
29-08-2020T13:11:55,Ordithus,"or just shallow reasons - money, rank"
29-08-2020T13:12:07,CrRAR,Gaston was also big jerk

29-08-2020T14:03:29,CrRAR,Done up as a sand-merwolf or whatever.
29-08-2020T14:07:35,CrRAR,He could probably coyly smush Nibbly's sandcastle with his womanliness.

29-08-2020T15:28:47,ProsePro7,Like Basitin ice cream I bet
29-08-2020T15:28:52,Ordithus,east or west
29-08-2020T15:28:58,PalmettoPathfinder1,Both

29-08-2020T15:29:24,PalmettoPathfinder1,It's probably not as strong as human coffee judging from Maddie's reaction to drinking Trace's coffee.

29-08-2020T16:32:08,Twokinds,"Yeah. 20 - 24 is the average. That's 3 weeks worth of sketches, give or take."

29-08-2020T16:45:40,PalmettoPathfinder1,Hope someone does a Nora Card for Aztec Adelaide.
29-08-2020T16:45:46,MoonDance,oh I forgot the Nora portrait was this month
29-08-2020T16:45:54,PalmettoPathfinder1,But I'm betting Ara got first place.
29-08-2020T16:45:54,ProsePro7,Natani and two Keiths perhaps?
29-08-2020T16:45:56,eric190,so do we need to clone tom for more art?
29-08-2020T16:46:04,Twokinds,Man I wish
29-08-2020T16:46:09,Avolendi,I like the Quiet On Set most of the runner ups :)

29-08-2020T16:47:06,MuonNeutrino,"Tom, what were the votes on the runners-up?"
29-08-2020T16:47:11,johnnytho,I wonder how nice the nice Tom must be then

29-08-2020T16:47:29,tehbear,be evil and swap one of the mikes for one of the runner ups :P
29-08-2020T16:47:38,ProsePro7,Natani and Keith are practically the main characters at this point
29-08-2020T16:47:50,RimaDraws,prose we are divorcing again
29-08-2020T16:47:51,MoonDance,I see more fem Mike being a new favorite
29-08-2020T16:47:52,Twokinds,Well... they are main characters.
29-08-2020T16:47:55,Mediawatcher,All amazing options!
29-08-2020T16:47:57,ProsePro7,No what?

29-08-2020T16:47:58,Ordithus,"Poor Mike.  Gets all the love, but only when he's a girl"
29-08-2020T16:47:59,Twokinds,They're 2 of the main four.
29-08-2020T16:48:00,Mediawatcher,all amazing wins!
29-08-2020T16:48:05,PalmettoPathfinder1,I'm very surprised that Aztec Adelaide didn't win. Maybe we should have had 7 picks after all.
29-08-2020T16:48:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I love all these choices
29-08-2020T16:48:12,MuonNeutrino,at least no clovis this time

29-08-2020T16:48:18,johnnytho,Trace is more interesting at least for this chapter
29-08-2020T16:48:24,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,I would Nora Card Ara if Tom still did Nora Cards

29-08-2020T18:42:33,ThingsAreMoving,more than two weeks
29-08-2020T18:42:42,Ordithus,I get that. Pizza is usually greasy and heavy.  Noodles more easily work out to something that can be a bit lighter
29-08-2020T18:43:05,BADBackgroundProductions,"Tom, are you writing this down? These are our food orders"
