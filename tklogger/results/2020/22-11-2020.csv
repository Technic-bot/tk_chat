22-11-2020T00:10:30,SpazztasticKiwi,so it was teens
22-11-2020T00:10:47,SpazztasticKiwi,aren’t you supposed to be bendy at that age
22-11-2020T00:10:53,Roughlandin,Teenage ligament injuries can be worse than adult ones
22-11-2020T00:10:56,Ordithus,you'd think that
22-11-2020T00:11:13,Ordithus,turns out even kids can only bend so far
22-11-2020T00:11:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I twisted my ankle when I was young then landed on it with all my weight & all I did was chip a bone n sprain it
22-11-2020T00:11:33,johnnytho,"I read/heard ""teenage ligament injuries"" to the TMNT theme haha"
22-11-2020T00:11:47,Roughlandin,lol

22-11-2020T00:12:17,BlackjackSec99,happy thanksgiving to y'all too
22-11-2020T00:12:25,Roughlandin,Bleck kiwi
22-11-2020T00:12:34,Ordithus,"I once fell off a nearly 30 foot pile of hay, only got a black eye"
22-11-2020T00:12:36,Roughlandin,Never broke a bone *knock on wood*
22-11-2020T00:12:42,SpazztasticKiwi,humans have the damage predictably of an iphone
22-11-2020T00:13:26,Roughlandin,My cousin amputated his thumb in a door at elementary school
22-11-2020T00:13:31,Ordithus,yikes
22-11-2020T00:13:38,Roughlandin,They were able to reattach it though
22-11-2020T00:13:55,Roughlandin,He has movement but no feeling
22-11-2020T00:14:09,Dadrobit,:/ I'm not springy or stretch at all. Broke damn near half the bones in my body at one point or another.
22-11-2020T00:14:17,Dadrobit,stretchy*
22-11-2020T00:14:19,johnnytho,Losing a digit is so scary. I would never be abe to play guitar anymore
22-11-2020T00:14:36,Roughlandin,I think I'm lucky that my bones are short and compact
22-11-2020T00:14:43,Roughlandin,Perks of being a smol bear
22-11-2020T00:14:47,Ordithus,"I haven't broken a bone, either"
22-11-2020T00:14:53,SpazztasticKiwi,you’ve also told us of some questionable (risky) life decisions you’ve had
22-11-2020T00:14:57,Ordithus,must have been that Wisconsin milk growing up
22-11-2020T00:15:05,SpazztasticKiwi,that might be the culprit
22-11-2020T00:15:09,SonOfGoku,I once put a screw thru my finger
22-11-2020T00:15:14,SpazztasticKiwi,tf
22-11-2020T00:15:19,Ordithus,ow

22-11-2020T00:15:22,SpazztasticKiwi,how or dare I ask
22-11-2020T00:15:23,Roughlandin,Not on purpose I imagine
22-11-2020T00:15:31,SonOfGoku,Work
22-11-2020T00:15:44,Ordithus,is it your job to fasten yourself to walls?
22-11-2020T00:15:48,Roughlandin,Nail gun or something similar?
22-11-2020T00:15:51,Dadrobit,"Ya, Spazz. Riding dirtbokes teaches you F=ma at a pretty quick pace."
22-11-2020T00:16:24,SonOfGoku,Screwing plywood to drywall but the screw was longer than the thickness of the materials
22-11-2020T00:16:28,SpazztasticKiwi,speed + solid object = ow
22-11-2020T00:16:36,johnnytho,physics is fun until your body learns Newton's 2nd law first hand
22-11-2020T00:16:46,Roughlandin,Ouch goku
22-11-2020T00:17:11,Roughlandin,My joint problems all began when I took a flying 8th grade girl to the knee
22-11-2020T00:17:18,SonOfGoku,Surprisingly it didn't hurt
22-11-2020T00:17:18,Ordithus,wat
22-11-2020T00:17:29,SpazztasticKiwi,you guys see that moron doing jump rope on a construction support beam
22-11-2020T00:17:31,KeefMcDerpface,Why was she flying?!
22-11-2020T00:17:49,Ordithus,"did he live, spazz?"
22-11-2020T00:17:50,SpazztasticKiwi,did somebody throw a child at you
22-11-2020T00:17:52,Roughlandin,8th graduation picnic. We put a bunch of people on the merry go round to see how fast we could spin it
22-11-2020T00:18:02,KeefMcDerpface,oh
22-11-2020T00:18:04,Roughlandin,She was the first to fly off
22-11-2020T00:18:07,Roughlandin,Into my knee
22-11-2020T00:18:10,Roughlandin,I did a flip
22-11-2020T00:18:19,KeefMcDerpface,A full on flip?!
22-11-2020T00:18:29,SpazztasticKiwi,did you at least stick the landing
22-11-2020T00:18:31,Roughlandin,All I know is I landed on my head
22-11-2020T00:18:37,KeefMcDerpface,Was that thing breaking the speed limit?
22-11-2020T00:18:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d guess he lived - honestly I can’t say I care
22-11-2020T00:19:05,Roughlandin,"Ouch, kiwi"
22-11-2020T00:19:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"if you’re dumb enough to do it, accept the possible extreme outcomes"
22-11-2020T00:19:22,Ordithus,that was about the guy jump roping on a beam rough
22-11-2020T00:19:28,Roughlandin,"Oh, okay"
22-11-2020T00:19:42,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s no reason to do that other that “hey y’all watch this”
22-11-2020T00:19:46,SpazztasticKiwi,than
22-11-2020T00:20:03,Ordithus,darwin award type
22-11-2020T00:20:06,Roughlandin,I just learned about a group of guys who spar with sharpened swords
22-11-2020T00:20:15,Roughlandin,THAT'S Darwin Award worthy
22-11-2020T00:20:52,SpazztasticKiwi,what about the guy that regularly tightropes across canyons
22-11-2020T00:20:55,SpazztasticKiwi,no net

22-11-2020T00:21:25,Ordithus,no shirt? so dangerous
22-11-2020T00:21:30,SpazztasticKiwi,the kind of stuff that makes you ask
22-11-2020T00:21:34,SpazztasticKiwi,b u t w h y
22-11-2020T00:21:46,Roughlandin,Why can't he just do the no shirt thing without all the crazy stuff?
22-11-2020T00:22:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"if it’s to impress girls, it’s not for this one"
22-11-2020T00:22:39,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s not brave - it’s stupid
22-11-2020T00:22:39,Roughlandin,I injured myself all the time as a kid! No girls were ever impressed!
22-11-2020T00:22:58,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-EmberShockFlip::shower:
22-11-2020T00:23:23,Roughlandin,"Taking a shower, Ord?"
22-11-2020T00:23:31,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe it’s the adrenaline thing
22-11-2020T00:23:45,johnnytho,real men shower with their computor
22-11-2020T00:24:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"with blood rushing through you that fast, it’s hard to think logically"

22-11-2020T00:32:49,CrRAR,"Do they come out more like tender, like ribs?"
22-11-2020T00:33:12,CrRAR,or like a ribeye I guess
22-11-2020T00:34:35,Dadrobit,Un fucking believably tender and tasty.
22-11-2020T00:34:52,Dadrobit,And it's suuuuper easy to get the perfect done-ness
22-11-2020T00:34:59,Dadrobit,EG: Medium Rare
22-11-2020T00:35:19,Dadrobit,Because you can't physically over-cook it.
22-11-2020T00:35:33,CrRAR,"Naw, not at that temp"
22-11-2020T00:35:47,Dadrobit,And you don't get situations where the outer crust is over done with pink in the middle.
22-11-2020T00:35:50,CrRAR,It literally just slowly reaches the perfect point
22-11-2020T00:36:08,CrRAR,"nope, consistently same"
22-11-2020T00:36:36,CrRAR,Yeah cuz I think the slow cookyness breaks down the harsh fibers of the meats

22-11-2020T00:37:17,Dadrobit,"Not my hands, but this is what happens."

22-11-2020T21:30:15,CrRAR,yeah
22-11-2020T21:30:37,CrRAR,cars are made to protect by crumpling these days
22-11-2020T21:30:40,Ordithus,I don't remember much of sounds from when I rolled my car that one time
22-11-2020T21:30:49,Ordithus,"airbag went off, so probably made me pretty deaf for a bit"
22-11-2020T21:31:02,Ordithus,as well as how quick the whole thing was
22-11-2020T21:31:18,CrRAR,"oof, sorry to hear, quite the ordeal no doubt"
22-11-2020T21:31:22,Ordithus,I was fine!
22-11-2020T21:31:27,SpazztasticKiwi,they’re not shitting when they say it all happens so fast
22-11-2020T21:31:37,Ordithus,Worst injury (other than ego) was a blister from the airbag
22-11-2020T21:32:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Colin hit a tree going 70 after falling asleep driving
22-11-2020T21:32:12,Ordithus,ow
22-11-2020T21:32:20,SpazztasticKiwi,what I understand is he never felt anything
22-11-2020T21:32:59,CrRAR,Never underestimate the protective power of full ragdoll physics.
22-11-2020T21:33:02,SpazztasticKiwi,same with Austin but he lost control going around a corner
22-11-2020T21:33:06,CrRAR,Seatbelt?
22-11-2020T21:33:07,SpazztasticKiwi,he was late to work
22-11-2020T21:33:30,CrRAR,arg
22-11-2020T21:33:51,CrRAR,That reminds me of that movie 'Whiplash'
22-11-2020T21:34:01,CrRAR,not. worth. it.
22-11-2020T21:34:10,Ordithus,me - I was wearing my seatbelt. for sure that kept me from having serious injuries
22-11-2020T21:34:15,SpazztasticKiwi,there wasn’t any mention of a seatbelt for either of them but they died on impact or on scene according to the reports
22-11-2020T21:34:17,Ordithus,roll over - those kill. I had a blister
22-11-2020T21:34:40,SpazztasticKiwi,they shared pictures of Austins car
22-11-2020T21:34:46,SpazztasticKiwi,what’s left of it
22-11-2020T21:35:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Austin was a friend
22-11-2020T21:35:16,Ordithus,sorry
22-11-2020T21:35:19,CrRAR,"seatbelts save lives, yeah often shared as a example of being careful and all that"
22-11-2020T21:35:30,SpazztasticKiwi,we weren’t close but he was good
22-11-2020T21:35:37,SpazztasticKiwi,really good
22-11-2020T21:37:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I knew him better than Colin but their families and girlfriends
22-11-2020T21:37:17,CrRAR,"Yeah, it's very strange thinking of losing folks at our age, something that really doesn't occur to ya too much."
22-11-2020T21:37:43,CrRAR,:cw0lfmare-EmberSad:
22-11-2020T21:37:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Colin died months after graduation - the entire grade was shot
22-11-2020T21:38:07,SpazztasticKiwi,dude had Just turned 19
22-11-2020T21:38:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Austin died closer to earlier this year
22-11-2020T21:38:48,CrRAR,:trumpet::notes::notes::notes:
22-11-2020T21:38:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"it’s like I said on twitter, if you’re late to work, be late"
22-11-2020T21:39:04,CrRAR,Yuppp
22-11-2020T21:39:06,SpazztasticKiwi,you can’t be late twice
22-11-2020T21:39:11,SpazztasticKiwi,or if you’re dead
22-11-2020T21:40:02,SpazztasticKiwi,car looking like crushed red tinfoil
22-11-2020T21:40:56,CrRAR,"Yeah, mythbusters did an episode about speeds and crashes"
22-11-2020T21:41:08,Folfy,sorry to hear that Kiwi
22-11-2020T21:41:08,CrRAR,Past 50mph it gets ugly
22-11-2020T21:41:19,Ordithus,I remember the 2 cars going 60 at each other myth
22-11-2020T21:41:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t know how fast he was going
22-11-2020T21:41:30,Ordithus,sending a car into a wall at 120... wow
22-11-2020T21:41:32,Folfy,yeah they did a lot of experiments with cars
22-11-2020T21:41:39,CrRAR,Yeah that one ord!
22-11-2020T21:41:43,Folfy,lots of them disintegrated
22-11-2020T21:41:54,Ordithus,the trunk was the front seat after that
22-11-2020T21:41:57,SpazztasticKiwi,but it was enough to make a tire and it’s whole axle as well as part of the hood disappear
22-11-2020T21:42:04,CrRAR,Two head on cancel each other to a degree
22-11-2020T21:42:19,CrRAR,Yeah basically folded over on itself
22-11-2020T21:42:46,SpazztasticKiwi,...I mean I have pictures of it and it makes me feel funny looking at them because a man died in there
22-11-2020T21:43:01,Ordithus,that is really uncomfortable to see
22-11-2020T21:43:04,CrRAR,yeahhhh ;_;
22-11-2020T21:43:08,Folfy,I can familiarize with that
22-11-2020T21:43:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"to be clear, his mother or maybe his grandmother shared the pictures so they’re from a post"
22-11-2020T21:44:12,CrRAR,ah
22-11-2020T21:44:18,SpazztasticKiwi,she shared warning people DO NOT SPEED even if you’re late to work
22-11-2020T21:44:39,CrRAR,Yeah to encourage safety
22-11-2020T21:44:41,Folfy,yes speeding is very bad
22-11-2020T21:44:57,Folfy,where I live the snow causes you to slide everywhere
22-11-2020T21:45:42,Folfy,accidents sky rocket during that time
22-11-2020T21:46:29,CrRAR,yeah snow changes the game
22-11-2020T21:46:44,CrRAR,be very very suspicious
22-11-2020T21:47:26,CrRAR,like dealing with dinosaurs
22-11-2020T21:47:35,Folfy,Absolutely. I was riding with some of my friends once my dad was taking us in our van. He tried to stop around 30 feet from the light going about 35 miles per hour or less Car just kept sliding
22-11-2020T21:47:39,CrRAR,no. sudden. movements.
22-11-2020T21:47:41,Folfy,luckily it stopped
22-11-2020T21:47:50,Folfy,but man it was so weird feeling it keep moving
22-11-2020T21:48:10,Ordithus,"snow can be fun, too"
22-11-2020T21:48:16,CrRAR,yeah the stopping thing is worse cuz you can only fix it by stopping ahead
22-11-2020T21:48:26,Folfy,doughnuts in the snow
22-11-2020T21:48:33,CrRAR,Fishtails can be fixed relatively easy
22-11-2020T21:48:51,CrRAR,"Don't freak out, foot off the accelerator"
22-11-2020T21:49:01,Folfy,I haven't actual ever driven yet. 1 year I can get my drivers license.
22-11-2020T21:49:15,CrRAR,Steer 'away' from the way the back goes.
22-11-2020T21:50:42,Ordithus,car I had a few years back had all wheel drive
22-11-2020T21:50:50,Ordithus,made me giddy :cw0lfmare-EmberTooHappy:
22-11-2020T21:51:00,Folfy,yeah my family wanted me to get an all wheel drive
22-11-2020T21:51:23,CrRAR,"yes, it pushes! it pulls!"
22-11-2020T21:51:34,CrRAR,perfecc
22-11-2020T21:51:41,Ordithus,few thins as fun to someone who grew up in winter wonderland as climbing a hill through 5 inches of fresh snow with no fuss
22-11-2020T21:52:13,Ordithus,like a cheat code
22-11-2020T21:52:15,Folfy,So that's what happened. Currently working on fixing up an old 2003 Porsche Cayenne
22-11-2020T21:52:27,CrRAR,"yeah my current car is awd, feels much more sure-footed on everything"
22-11-2020T21:52:36,Folfy,that's pretty cool Ord
22-11-2020T21:52:39,CrRAR,like kinda on rails
22-11-2020T21:53:22,CrRAR,just having a heavy vehicle helps tbh
22-11-2020T21:53:26,Ordithus,snow tires help but aren't everything
22-11-2020T21:53:30,Folfy,yeah
22-11-2020T21:53:35,CrRAR,yeap
22-11-2020T21:53:38,Ordithus,"though they help in braking and corners, awd does not"
22-11-2020T21:54:01,CrRAR,yeah you can still be slippy
22-11-2020T21:54:10,Folfy,just its more unlikely
22-11-2020T21:55:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I might track down his grave tomorrow for a visit
22-11-2020T21:57:22,CrRAR,:bouquet:

22-11-2020T22:07:06,SpazztasticKiwi,mud is slick
22-11-2020T22:07:09,CrRAR,It is wacky sometimes how suddenly it happens
22-11-2020T22:07:52,CrRAR,"Yeah just like no more gas pedal, no brake, mostly a mild one just stops."
22-11-2020T22:08:23,SpazztasticKiwi,can’t slide if you got no oomph
22-11-2020T22:08:34,CrRAR,yep

22-11-2020T22:17:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"good, but it needed more mushrooms and the onions needed a bit longer on the ol griller"
22-11-2020T22:18:16,SpazztasticKiwi,but the “special” aioli sauce....decent
22-11-2020T22:18:25,CrRAR,"yeah, onions need to be done just right"

22-11-2020T22:21:33,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s also a swiss mushroom burger melt that I chose the steakhouse mushroom melt over that I’m eyeing to try
22-11-2020T22:21:51,Ordithus,yer makin me hungry
