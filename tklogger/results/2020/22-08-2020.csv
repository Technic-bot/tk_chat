22-08-2020T00:08:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I think imma go for the How Dare You suggestion

22-08-2020T00:10:15,CrRAR,wait is the kitty Flora or Cat Nora? xD
22-08-2020T00:10:32,SpazztasticKiwi,which one
22-08-2020T00:10:49,CrRAR,the kitty that Nora is telling Trace he wants?
22-08-2020T00:11:31,CrRAR,*Trace ends up with Flora anyway*

22-08-2020T00:12:22,SpazztasticKiwi,it would make the most sense it‚Äôs another ‚Äútry to trick Trace‚Äù thing and she‚Äôs juggling the mini devil/angel forms on traces shoulders as well as her actual self in front of him but it could just be her in Devil/angel cat form on his shoulders
22-08-2020T00:13:19,CrRAR,cogent explanation
22-08-2020T00:13:37,SpazztasticKiwi,but it would be sweet for her to do it in a case where Trace somehow lost his memory or got jumbled because of a fall or accident and she wanted to fix things
22-08-2020T00:14:25,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs already been established she likes him and wants him but if I remember right it‚Äôs because he intrigues her and she wants it to be a conscience decision on his part

22-08-2020T12:45:52,Ordithus,remastering and actually giving a damn in the engineering of the more modern records
22-08-2020T12:46:02,CrRAR,"You can kinda tell though when they‚Äôre sloppy that it‚Äôs not truly authentic, organic film grain"

22-08-2020T12:47:12,CrRAR,Like listening to a song though the organice din of the indifferent universe~
22-08-2020T12:47:52,TheSexyBeast,Problem with modern recordings on vinyl: it still sounds compressed because it was recorded digitally
22-08-2020T12:47:56,Dadrobit,"I want to hear the artists as they played, not a version played through a filter"
22-08-2020T12:47:59,CrRAR,(or maybe those are just the flecks of dust on the record surface)
22-08-2020T12:48:25,Dadrobit,Digital recording is not what creates compression. Bad engineers cause compression.
22-08-2020T12:48:27,Ordithus,the audio won't be compressed in the studio unless they need to be fired
22-08-2020T12:48:30,CrRAR,I would argue then that digitally appied effects are more of a ‚Äòfilter‚Äô than vinyl
22-08-2020T12:48:58,Dadrobit,"It's a fun fact, didn't say I agree with it. I certainly don't do it."
22-08-2020T12:49:05,TheSexyBeast,I need to clarify:
22-08-2020T12:49:51,TheSexyBeast,Recording into a computer vs. recording directly on tape
22-08-2020T12:50:02,CrRAR,I wonder though how much of old sound quality on vinyl was louse microphone technology?
22-08-2020T12:50:10,CrRAR,*lousy
22-08-2020T12:50:35,Ordithus,"something I don't like about a lot of modern music is the sheer loudness.  CDs have an amazing dynamic range, but let's just use a teeny bit to make it LOUD"
22-08-2020T12:51:07,CrRAR,"Like when old movies get remasted to Bluray, the source film media and the quality of the cameras determine how muddled and grainy it was... and how muddled and grainy it remains on Blueray"
22-08-2020T12:51:24,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/grJCTBl.png I am very subtle when I apply compression.
22-08-2020T12:51:43,CrRAR,It often seemed like it was down to the budgets  of the production on what cameras they could use at the time
22-08-2020T12:52:26,Ordithus,"or 16mm vs 35mm or, with infinite money, IMAX"
22-08-2020T12:52:44,CrRAR,Lots of times the only thing the transition to Blueray achieves in the modern era is clearer HD GRAIN
22-08-2020T12:52:48,CrRAR,xD
22-08-2020T12:53:18,Dadrobit,"RAR, it super depends. Old mics are still very viable and plenty clear."
22-08-2020T12:53:20,Ordithus,I like that more than it just being low res
22-08-2020T12:53:23,CrRAR,So lots of obsure movies that had limited budgets will always remain a warm and extra FUZZY experience
22-08-2020T12:53:46,Dadrobit,A modern SM7b is like $400. One from 50 years ago is upwards of $1k.
22-08-2020T12:53:57,CrRAR,Yeah ord cuz then you just accept it as being OoF and not in-your-face grainy xD
22-08-2020T12:54:09,CrRAR,Makes sense daddio
22-08-2020T12:54:29,Dadrobit,And don't even get me started on Neumann longevity. That shit is literally bonkers.
22-08-2020T12:54:35,TheSexyBeast,"I like Lewitt mics, they are top shelf"

22-08-2020T14:23:48,CrRAR,I suppose the bees get the nectar from cactus flowers?
22-08-2020T14:23:48,SpazztasticKiwi,so
22-08-2020T14:23:52,Dadrobit,I've seen the demon cow pop up in a couple places now actually

22-08-2020T14:24:20,Dadrobit,"Among other plants, yeah."
22-08-2020T14:24:25,CrRAR,They do say that distinct flavor of honey is determined by where the nectar was collected

22-08-2020T14:24:34,Dadrobit,Super crazy earthy-ness to the flavor.
22-08-2020T14:24:45,SpazztasticKiwi,the color depends on what kind of flower
22-08-2020T14:24:46,CrRAR,...and I know cactus flower to be particlarly more sweet in general

22-08-2020T14:40:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd turned 18 that October before and the boys had bb guns
22-08-2020T14:41:23,SpazztasticKiwi,they wanted to play with them and the little shts were smart enough to know they couldn‚Äôt play with them without someone 18 or over

22-08-2020T14:43:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I sat in the living room within eyeshot of where they had the guns stored up on the highest of shelves (for good reason as it seems) because I knew one of the boys was known for doing things after being told no
22-08-2020T14:44:28,CrRAR,All you need is the little goofs trying to impress you with fancy marksmanship tricks

22-08-2020T14:49:50,CrimsonQuill,Made almost the exact same sort of sound.

22-08-2020T14:54:43,CrimsonQuill,@CrRAR Got it from a Just William book-it's going pale in a sickening way
22-08-2020T14:54:53,CrRAR,was it the thing that happened to the alien in Alien: Resurrection?
22-08-2020T14:55:15,CrRAR,Got sucked through a window because of the space vacuum?
22-08-2020T14:55:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Through a golf ball sized hole yes
22-08-2020T14:55:36,CrimsonQuill,dunno
22-08-2020T14:55:40,CrimsonQuill,Stopped after Aliens
22-08-2020T14:55:41,JSWolf,is stream on time
22-08-2020T14:55:47,mingun,Tom said the stream is postponed until 5pm.
22-08-2020T14:55:50,Dadrobit,hour late today
22-08-2020T14:55:51,CrRAR,yeah that one wasn't worth watching

22-08-2020T14:56:32,CrimsonQuill,Maybe tonight I can finish that comic page I was doing
22-08-2020T14:56:39,Dadrobit,"Also, no, it was like a loading bay airlock that he locked himself in under the demonic influence."
22-08-2020T14:57:04,CrimsonQuill,I found out about Event horizon when I was looking up the Warp in 40k
22-08-2020T14:57:19,Dadrobit,Then the demonic influence left him with something like 20 seconds left before the airlock opened and the rest of the crew struggled to override it.
22-08-2020T14:57:31,CrimsonQuill,And learned that the filmmakers wanted to basically take inspiration from the nightmares of the warp and demonic possession of the crew
22-08-2020T14:57:34,SpazztasticKiwi,hei hei was meant to be moanas guardian before they had to cut the idea
22-08-2020T14:57:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Poor Sam Neill, first he opens a portal to hell in space and then he got chased by dinosaurs"
22-08-2020T14:57:53,CrimsonQuill,"Can't catch a break, that guy"
22-08-2020T14:58:02,Dadrobit,So this kid was just lost wondering why he'd been locked in the airlock to be jettisoned. The bleeding eyeballs really fucked with younger me.
22-08-2020T14:58:16,Twokinds,Reminder: stream will be at 5pm today.
22-08-2020T14:58:29,CrimsonQuill,"Hi Tom-thanks for that, was wondering what time"
22-08-2020T14:58:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Dad, anything eye related is a no go for me"
22-08-2020T14:58:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I can‚Äôt see how effective a twig of a chicken would be as a guardian
22-08-2020T14:58:46,CrimsonQuill,Ditto Marv
22-08-2020T14:58:54,Dadrobit,Same. Only part of John Wick that got to me was the slow eye stabbing.
22-08-2020T14:59:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Same
22-08-2020T14:59:38,Dadrobit,Still an incredible series tho
22-08-2020T14:59:40,jirka,Hi Tom and ok Tom
22-08-2020T15:00:02,CrRAR,Yeah leaving that as a folktale in the first was a better approach
22-08-2020T15:00:05,SpazztasticKiwi,bleeding eyes is child‚Äôs play
22-08-2020T15:00:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I watch too much horror
22-08-2020T15:00:24,CrimsonQuill,...
22-08-2020T15:00:35,CrimsonQuill,...still never finished alien isolation...
22-08-2020T15:00:41,Dadrobit,Childs Play is a totally different series
22-08-2020T15:00:47,CrimsonQuill,...despite having watched a markiplier and sovietwomble video...
22-08-2020T15:00:57,CrRAR,I liked the 2nd John Wick aspect in that the assassins can literally owe each other their lives by NEARLY killing them and the showing mercy
22-08-2020T15:01:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Alien Isolation is so good
22-08-2020T15:01:15,CrRAR,"Like ""You're still alive because of me, so now I own you"""
22-08-2020T15:01:25,Dadrobit,Only ever seen the first two Alien movies and AvP
22-08-2020T15:01:45,CrRAR,That's probably a good stop point
22-08-2020T15:01:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,^
22-08-2020T15:01:53,CrRAR,also Alien:Isolation is a game

22-08-2020T15:02:20,CrimsonQuill,I just don't do well with Horror
22-08-2020T15:02:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Although I will say that Alien 3 could have been awesome if the studio didn't get in the way
22-08-2020T15:02:33,Dadrobit,Seeing the first two in theaters is such a good time. Highly recommend it if your theater offers the occasional classic viewing.

22-08-2020T15:30:18,ThingsAreMoving,My suggestion was on 5th place and then dropped to 5th from the end
22-08-2020T15:30:32,Brocade,My idea involves male Mike so I'll be happy if it makes it into the top half
22-08-2020T15:30:33,ThingsAreMoving,It all depends what sort of suggestions you're up against
22-08-2020T15:30:38,Majyxs,More than 4 votes is what I hope to get.

22-08-2020T15:34:25,JSWolf,I got...fourth I think last week? Maybe fifth?
22-08-2020T15:36:22,Brocade,I had an idea where fem-clovis is jealous of fem-Brutus but a similar idea won last week I think
22-08-2020T15:36:30,FloofyCat,I got my first vote win last stream so I can't suggest this week.
22-08-2020T15:36:45,FloofyCat,All my other picks were Tom picks I think
22-08-2020T15:37:30,JSWolf,what'd you suggest?
22-08-2020T15:37:39,JSWolf,last week when it won i mean

22-08-2020T22:43:42,qwe304,well that means it exists
22-08-2020T22:43:56,CrRAR,sketches and monthly colors largely supplanted artbookyness
22-08-2020T22:44:02,InTheLionsDen,Just another 199 pages to go.
22-08-2020T22:44:02,qwe304,which was more than Id hoped for for a rumor I heard like a year ago
22-08-2020T22:44:26,qwe304,:ptv-angry: mfw theres art by tom I havent seen
22-08-2020T22:44:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I ask because of the youtooz giveaways
22-08-2020T22:44:59,Ordithus,"if he's anything like most artists, there's a bazillion sketches that have never been seen by other eyes"
22-08-2020T22:45:11,qwe304,:ptv-whiny:

22-08-2020T22:45:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt know how they‚Äôre gonna pick winners and it‚Äôs partially cause they have so many people in the selection
22-08-2020T22:45:29,CrRAR,there's always a cutting room floor~
22-08-2020T22:46:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"23,000+ on instagram alone this morning"
22-08-2020T22:46:09,RimaDraws,so a second  art book?
22-08-2020T22:46:13,RimaDraws,that is something i am gonna want
22-08-2020T22:46:18,SpazztasticKiwi,and that‚Äôs just for one of the two
22-08-2020T22:46:30,SpazztasticKiwi,then there‚Äôs the twitter giveaways
22-08-2020T22:46:34,Ordithus,what're you talking about spazz?
22-08-2020T22:46:46,SpazztasticKiwi,youtooz but nm it‚Äôs not important
22-08-2020T22:47:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd give the art book another year
22-08-2020T22:47:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"even if it‚Äôs done this year, there‚Äôs ordering and shipping and online shopping isn‚Äôt going to well all around"
22-08-2020T22:47:43,SpazztasticKiwi,too
22-08-2020T22:48:03,qwe304,"insert ""its been 84 years"" meme"
22-08-2020T22:48:17,CrRAR,the reprints are in some state of progress for other volumes so that's something c:
22-08-2020T22:48:27,SpazztasticKiwi,if it takes 84 years someone please for the love of God stop Tom
22-08-2020T22:48:37,SpazztasticKiwi,he‚Äôll be 114
22-08-2020T22:48:46,SpazztasticKiwi,117
22-08-2020T22:48:53,qwe304,statisticaly that is improbable
22-08-2020T22:49:09,SpazztasticKiwi,the stubborn ones live the longest

22-08-2020T22:50:14,qwe304,someone sent me this but I cant find the piece its from... https://imgur.com/a/JUtK56T
22-08-2020T22:50:19,CrRAR,mind over matter as they say
22-08-2020T22:50:49,SpazztasticKiwi,if you ignore your birthdays they don‚Äôt happen
22-08-2020T22:51:21,CrRAR,looks like an edit qwe?
22-08-2020T22:51:59,CrRAR,Is that Flora's baby that Kat held in that sketch that one time possibly?
22-08-2020T22:52:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Ferdy is moving his cave slowly across his tank and I don‚Äôt know why
22-08-2020T22:52:15,qwe304,its pretty well done if it is
22-08-2020T22:52:30,RimaDraws,mine is in another three weeks...
22-08-2020T22:52:34,qwe304,then again there was that one guy that almost perfectly replicated toms art...
22-08-2020T22:52:52,Ordithus,Ferdy doin' some rearranging
22-08-2020T22:52:58,Ordithus,Spruce up the place
22-08-2020T22:53:05,qwe304,"a guy showed me a sketch and i was loke ""oh cool, when did tom draw this?"" and he was like ""he didnt"""
22-08-2020T22:53:18,BadFoMo,What was it?
22-08-2020T22:53:21,RimaDraws,he is remodeling
22-08-2020T22:53:27,qwe304,ill dig it up
22-08-2020T22:53:41,qwe304,i have a folder for all my interesting things
22-08-2020T22:54:06,SpazztasticKiwi,junk drawers are now junk folders
22-08-2020T22:54:24,qwe304,https://imgur.com/a/suUbvJT there
22-08-2020T22:54:49,Ordithus,Prequel!
22-08-2020T22:54:51,KeefMcDerpface,oh wow
22-08-2020T22:54:59,qwe304,ikr
22-08-2020T22:55:04,BadFoMo,That /wasn't/ Tom's?
22-08-2020T22:56:24,CrRAR,yeah I think that was confirmed to not be
22-08-2020T22:56:38,qwe304,yeah it was just some random guy
22-08-2020T22:56:41,qwe304,dont recall who
22-08-2020T22:56:45,qwe304,but not toms
22-08-2020T22:57:02,Ordithus,freaky if true
22-08-2020T22:57:41,SpazztasticKiwi,remember there was also someone awhile back that asked if it was plagiarism to have his characters called keidran
22-08-2020T22:57:57,SpazztasticKiwi,and be anthropomorphic
22-08-2020T22:58:08,qwe304,iirc you cant copyright a fictional species
22-08-2020T22:58:26,qwe304,bringing me back to that primagen drama lmao
22-08-2020T22:58:34,SpazztasticKiwi,alright well how about the fact it‚Äôd be rude and distasteful
22-08-2020T22:58:48,SpazztasticKiwi,if not unoriginal
22-08-2020T22:59:16,SpazztasticKiwi,though that was Toms question to answer at the time
22-08-2020T22:59:39,qwe304,I donnt see any reason to/not to for that manner
22-08-2020T22:59:45,SpazztasticKiwi,so he can knock himself out with that one I guess
22-08-2020T23:00:23,qwe304,"i mean anthro characters have existed as depicted in toms work for ages, he just stuck a label on it for his story(s)"
22-08-2020T23:00:30,SpazztasticKiwi,oh did dadro get to submit his suggestion this time around
22-08-2020T23:00:44,MuonNeutrino,"@qwe304 i found where that maeve thing is from, it's an edit of this sketch https://www.patreon.com/posts/night-of-raines-21336847"
22-08-2020T23:00:58,SpazztasticKiwi,you completely missed my point while also stating it
22-08-2020T23:01:17,qwe304,your right muo!
22-08-2020T23:01:26,RimaDraws,well i am going to bed. goodnight guys. and thanks tom for the stream night.
22-08-2020T23:01:31,qwe304,it looked legit so I was confused for a while
22-08-2020T23:01:38,MuonNeutrino,i was looking at it and thinking that the face just didn't look quite right
22-08-2020T23:01:41,Ordithus,night Rima!
22-08-2020T23:01:43,KeefMcDerpface,bye Rima
22-08-2020T23:01:52,qwe304,ill bet the face is ripped from another sketch
22-08-2020T23:01:53,CrRAR,"ah, there you go I knew it was familiar, I think the head poking out was from the auntie Kat one though too"
22-08-2020T23:01:58,MuonNeutrino,i'm 99% sure it's a mashup of someone taking a maeve face from somewhere else in tom's work and pasting it in
22-08-2020T23:02:13,CrRAR,yeah the body and everything don't fit
22-08-2020T23:02:17,MuonNeutrino,"i looked at the auntie kat one, but it's not that"
22-08-2020T23:02:40,MuonNeutrino,the baby is purely a slight recoloring of baby raine from the mary one
22-08-2020T23:02:44,CrRAR,do you have a link I though the tigery head was there?
22-08-2020T23:02:55,MuonNeutrino,https://www.patreon.com/posts/maternal-26999545

22-08-2020T23:03:20,CrRAR,just a tail
22-08-2020T23:03:23,MuonNeutrino,yeah
22-08-2020T23:03:25,CrRAR,haha
22-08-2020T23:03:35,MuonNeutrino,you can see whoever made that edit just darkened the ears and added the pattern on the tail
22-08-2020T23:03:39,SpazztasticKiwi,for a second patreon looked like it was acting up again
