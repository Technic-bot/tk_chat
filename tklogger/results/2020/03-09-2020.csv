03-09-2020T17:13:32,MviluUatusun,"w0lfmare, I just wanted to let you know I'm starting to like Vivian.  Is it because she's a hyena that she wears the bandages on her arms or is it some other reason?"

03-09-2020T17:14:40,w0lfmare,"Yup! Vivian wears the bandages to hide her stripes, which are a dead giveaway that she's a hyena, and not a Tennin race"

03-09-2020T17:14:57,swedishkitsune,back again

03-09-2020T21:41:38,SageSaga,if Tom's style had an exponential change you couldnt recognize it from his old work

03-09-2020T21:42:33,BADBackgroundProductions,I think what I meant was more of a character style evolution chart
03-09-2020T21:43:31,SageSaga,hes clearly improved his work but exponential is like going from stick figures to - well Purples drawing there
03-09-2020T21:43:34,ZRO4825,"Ahh, yes, but artists can look at it and see the progression. Non-artists would typically just see end results and would possibly have a suspicion, but perhaps not be so sure. lol"

03-09-2020T23:22:51,BadFoMo,Yo.
03-09-2020T23:22:51,ZRO4825,Heyyo Dadro
03-09-2020T23:23:14,ZRO4825,I need to take like a week off from work some time soon. I'm getting to the point of wanting to start braining customers for stupidity again. <_<
03-09-2020T23:25:01,Ordithus,hi dadro!
03-09-2020T23:25:05,SageSaga,how dumb are we talking here Zro
03-09-2020T23:25:08,SageSaga,and yo Robit
03-09-2020T23:25:25,Ordithus,Kaylin right there <3
03-09-2020T23:25:33,ZRO4825,We had a customer had to ask us what the difference was between Hot and Mild buffalo sauce for the wings...
03-09-2020T23:26:24,SageSaga,thats not exactly stupid- some places have very different flavors from their mild to hot sauces
03-09-2020T23:26:32,AspiringNoodle,^^^
03-09-2020T23:26:43,AspiringNoodle,I've been to some sports bars where the difference wasn't that big
03-09-2020T23:26:44,ZRO4825,We're a pizza shop. Not a wing place.  :V
03-09-2020T23:26:49,AspiringNoodle,And others where mild was nice and flavorful
03-09-2020T23:26:56,Dadrobit,"Sounds like a poorly phrased version of, ""is your hot sauce actually hot?"""
03-09-2020T23:27:02,AspiringNoodle,And hot was like sticking your tongue through a portal to the pits of hell :ptv-laugh:
03-09-2020T23:27:06,SageSaga,lots of pizza places sell wings bro
03-09-2020T23:27:11,CrRAR,*go on scofield-specific scientific rant*
03-09-2020T23:27:12,Dadrobit,Which I'd consider Also a valid question.
03-09-2020T23:27:29,Werewing,"I am not aware of a Pizza place that doesn't have wings, actually."
03-09-2020T23:27:42,AspiringNoodle,Sometimes I want to brain my company for shorting the store on hours
03-09-2020T23:27:43,Dadrobit,Chucky Cheese?
03-09-2020T23:27:46,CrRAR,:ccrrar-chickcr:
03-09-2020T23:27:51,ZRO4825,It's Hot Buffalo sauce versus Mild Buffalo sauce. The difference is kinda right there in the name. :joy:
03-09-2020T23:28:13,ZRO4825,Also had one who asked us how many wings come in an 8-piece order.
03-09-2020T23:28:15,AspiringNoodle,"""I'd like some mildly hot hot sauce please"""
03-09-2020T23:28:24,SageSaga,i dont think a little caesars has wings- but they could now
03-09-2020T23:28:27,AspiringNoodle,...that..............I got nothing...
03-09-2020T23:28:40,Ordithus,"4 wings, really, they're just split in two"
03-09-2020T23:28:43,Werewing,"They have had them before, not sure of atm, though, sage."
03-09-2020T23:31:48,SageSaga,yep they even have em now too- i know back when there was one nearby they didnt though
03-09-2020T23:31:55,SageSaga,but that was . . . 12 years ago
03-09-2020T23:33:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"Sage, I had a lady ask me if a rectangle cake was a square"
03-09-2020T23:33:12,Werewing,"Careful Sage, we might be able to guess your age."
03-09-2020T23:33:32,Werewing,"All squares are rectangles, not all rectangles are squares."
03-09-2020T23:33:33,SageSaga,a rectangle is a square but a square is not always a rectangle
03-09-2020T23:33:33,Dadrobit,"Depends on the rectangle, Spazz."
03-09-2020T23:33:48,BadFoMo,"@SpazztasticKiwi Well, it has 4 sides."
03-09-2020T23:33:50,SageSaga,i am 35 i think
03-09-2020T23:34:09,ZRO4825,Can confirm.
03-09-2020T23:34:19,BadFoMo,You think? You're as bad as my friend.
03-09-2020T23:34:32,SpazztasticKiwi,she wanted a box square  cake - I told her all we have is rectangle
03-09-2020T23:34:39,SageSaga,i am 35
03-09-2020T23:34:43,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúis that a square?‚Äù
03-09-2020T23:34:47,SageSaga,i will be 36 in a few months
03-09-2020T23:35:58,SpazztasticKiwi,is it 30 where you start to have to actively count the years after your birth date to find out your age
03-09-2020T23:36:10,SpazztasticKiwi,or does that memory loss start more around 35
03-09-2020T23:36:14,ZRO4825,It's whenever your brain starts refusing to keep track of it. :P
03-09-2020T23:36:21,SageSaga,i just stopped caring a while ago
03-09-2020T23:36:39,Ordithus,"another year down, meh"
03-09-2020T23:36:45,SageSaga,im an adult- what else am i counting up to? my death? no thanks
03-09-2020T23:36:50,Dadrobit,I think I stopped thinking about it at 26.
03-09-2020T23:36:58,SageSaga,when theres ultra porn i will remember

03-09-2020T23:38:33,SpazztasticKiwi,October birthdays: literally everyone is and will be older than you
03-09-2020T23:38:38,BadFoMo,"I remember hearing my 'friend' (when he was asked how old he was [by his mother]) say ""I don't know. 28, 29?"""
03-09-2020T23:38:39,Ordithus,what age was that again? It was pretty old
03-09-2020T23:38:59,SpazztasticKiwi,dadro are you not 24 or something
03-09-2020T23:39:03,SageSaga,"The Professor got De-aged a bit and said ""Aww! Now I'll have to use a fake ID to watch ultraporn!"""
03-09-2020T23:39:29,Dadrobit,"No, that was years ago"
03-09-2020T23:39:33,BadFoMo,The fake IDs are /part/ of the fun.
03-09-2020T23:39:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I was thinking you were younger

03-09-2020T23:48:43,PurpleLemons,ni wolf
03-09-2020T23:50:19,SageSaga,the books were - about a guy who gets transported to parodies of anime/game world thanks to the Flying Spaghetti monster
03-09-2020T23:50:52,Dadrobit,Huh...
03-09-2020T23:51:23,SageSaga,ever seen High School of the Dead?
03-09-2020T23:51:51,Dadrobit,"Sorry, no. I think I've seen gifs, bit that's about it."
03-09-2020T23:52:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Sage have you seen The Jewish-Japanese Sex and Cookbook and How to Raise Wolves by Jack Douglas
03-09-2020T23:52:15,SageSaga,thats the first world he goes to- then in book 2 he goes to Konosuba
03-09-2020T23:52:24,Osean,Thanks for the stream W0lf!
03-09-2020T23:52:36,Kynum,sup
03-09-2020T23:52:39,SageSaga,Kiwi- no
03-09-2020T23:52:54,SageSaga,the 3rd book has set up going to FF7
03-09-2020T23:53:15,Dadrobit,"Ah, so it's the individual world's, and not like a single amalgamation of all world's trying to cohabitate."
03-09-2020T23:53:27,Dadrobit,Worlds*
03-09-2020T23:53:34,SageSaga,right- hes able to jump between worlds
03-09-2020T23:53:40,jesonite,Thanks for the stream Wolf!
03-09-2020T23:54:02,SageSaga,basically in the Zombie world he runs into a thing he cant solve- so he goes to the Konasuba world to learn magic to combat Zombies
03-09-2020T23:54:09,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs a legit book but I don‚Äôt know why
03-09-2020T23:54:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve heard of high school of the dead but I haven‚Äôt been moved enough to try it
03-09-2020T23:55:27,Dadrobit,"Sage, it almost sounds like legitimate effort was put into this?"
03-09-2020T23:55:33,SageSaga,High School of the Dead is basically horny teens in a zombie apocalypse
03-09-2020T23:55:44,SageSaga,yeah its legit
03-09-2020T23:55:54,SageSaga,its written decently- pretty fun
03-09-2020T23:55:54,SpazztasticKiwi,that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not moved to try it out
03-09-2020T23:56:20,SageSaga,the parody version was called University of the Dead
03-09-2020T23:56:27,Dadrobit,"On the other, it also almost sounds like a kid writing his power fantasy fanfic."
03-09-2020T23:56:41,SageSaga,and Konosuba was called Magical Australia
03-09-2020T23:57:03,SageSaga,Robit- its actually called - Power Fantasy
