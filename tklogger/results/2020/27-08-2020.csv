27-08-2020T12:00:33,SpazztasticKiwi,tired
27-08-2020T12:04:55,CrRAR,I just got home
27-08-2020T12:05:05,CrRAR,got the last wee slice of pizza

27-08-2020T12:06:02,CrRAR,Are you workin or just tired from being up late?
27-08-2020T12:06:54,CrRAR,maybe a little of both?
27-08-2020T12:18:56,CrimsonQuill,Workin' late tomorrow
27-08-2020T12:19:01,CrimsonQuill,But tonight is cake and a film
27-08-2020T12:19:20,CrimsonQuill,Just finished Page 3 of 'Borrowed without Permission' too...I'm happy today! :D
27-08-2020T12:20:02,CrimsonQuill,Aaand I think I should get those Emoticons...just for funsies
27-08-2020T12:22:53,AspiringNoodle,Yay
27-08-2020T12:22:58,AspiringNoodle,Work is phasing out hazard pay
27-08-2020T12:23:15,CrimsonQuill,Beg pardon?
27-08-2020T12:23:23,AspiringNoodle,"This is the last week of $2 extra per hour, and I missed a day because of family bs"
27-08-2020T12:23:41,AspiringNoodle,"Starting next week, it's $1 per hour, and then in October it'll finallly be gone"
27-08-2020T12:25:05,CrimsonQuill,"First of all, what did the hazard pay cover, and secondly, why is it going?"
27-08-2020T12:25:12,AspiringNoodle,covid?
27-08-2020T12:25:14,AspiringNoodle,remember?
27-08-2020T12:25:19,CrimsonQuill,"Ah, I see."
27-08-2020T12:25:23,AspiringNoodle,The thing that's *still* around
27-08-2020T12:25:27,CrimsonQuill,"But, it shouldn't be going. Not yet."
27-08-2020T12:25:35,CrimsonQuill,Not until Covid is over.
27-08-2020T12:25:42,AspiringNoodle,At least my company kept it this long
27-08-2020T12:25:47,CrimsonQuill,"And last time I checked, it is still around."
27-08-2020T12:25:52,AspiringNoodle,"So many companies said ""Oh well, fuck you"" months ago"
27-08-2020T12:25:59,CrRAR,"Yup, weird times ahead, no more training wheels on the economy kiddos"
27-08-2020T12:26:03,CrimsonQuill,That's actually even more frightening.
27-08-2020T12:26:06,AspiringNoodle,Ended their hazard pays either in May or June
27-08-2020T12:26:20,AspiringNoodle,"I may have my gripes about my employer, but hazard pay wasn't one of them"
27-08-2020T12:26:23,CrimsonQuill,...that was during the worst time of the crisis over here.
27-08-2020T12:26:40,CrimsonQuill,"That's one thing going for them, I guess."
27-08-2020T12:31:44,CrRAR,Some industries got pay cuts our high-earners lost 10-20% of pay
27-08-2020T12:32:25,CrRAR,"I luckily flew under the radar, not much other than a pat on the back for all the adapting so far though."
27-08-2020T12:33:08,CrRAR,"Lucilky we’re a small firm, so it’s relatively a tight0knit environment"
27-08-2020T12:33:53,CrimsonQuill,I wonder how much nicer the world would be if we were a bit less miserly with our cash...all of us...
27-08-2020T12:34:11,CrimsonQuill,Because there are those who hoard and hoard it for its own sake
27-08-2020T12:34:27,CrimsonQuill,And others who barely have enough to buy food...if they have any at all.
27-08-2020T12:35:34,CrRAR,The large companies hoarding cash and hiding it overseas is probably the most damaging. Large volumes limit overall money supply liquidity
27-08-2020T12:36:08,CrRAR,WWhen everyone feels it’s hard to come by it’s probably because the big players are being stingy
27-08-2020T12:36:48,CrimsonQuill,"That's the way it's always been, hasn't it?...The toffs at the top and the toshers at the bottom..."
27-08-2020T12:36:53,CrRAR,"I mean, job wages haven’t exactly been generous, sure there are more people working but historically purse-strings are tighter"
27-08-2020T12:37:01,CrimsonQuill,supresses a rant
27-08-2020T12:37:10,CrRAR,Big cos are always trying to limit costs
27-08-2020T12:37:18,CrRAR,always
27-08-2020T12:37:43,CrimsonQuill,"But it's too seldom for the benefit of their enterprises, and too often for their own [REDACTED] wallets..."
27-08-2020T12:38:07,CrRAR,"A lot of it is emotion too, the bottom will spend and borrow more when they FEEL times are prosperous"
27-08-2020T12:38:41,CrRAR,"LIke, the credit crises have shown us... not even half of that is actually their own money probably xD"
27-08-2020T12:38:45,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, I've known the feeling. It's terrible."
27-08-2020T12:39:33,CrimsonQuill,"You have more than you've ever had, it might be a miniscule amount but a part of you cries out, 'I'M RICH', and fritters it away faster than a fox after a rabbit."
27-08-2020T12:40:19,CrRAR,I feel like right now the high costs of things is making people feel ANY amount of money is small.
27-08-2020T12:40:38,CrRAR,"Houses, cars, goods, all are really at cycle-highs"
27-08-2020T12:41:15,CrRAR,So like any money the average folks make tends to feel not so significant rn.
27-08-2020T12:42:02,CrRAR,"...but then, at least in America, we have that sense of patriotism and WINNING that was happening in the mid 00’s."
27-08-2020T12:42:43,CrimsonQuill,I remember the end of the Celtic Tiger in Europe...that's what they called Ireland.
27-08-2020T12:43:16,CrRAR,"So people may begin to consume, depending if they can acquire debt or not, depending on what happens in the work economy and if everthing comes out of covid intact"
27-08-2020T12:43:19,CrimsonQuill,"Huge housing estates going up, little oversight on spending...some of them are ghost towns now, and the government is talking about social housing being in short supply.."
27-08-2020T12:43:39,CrimsonQuill,Online shopping makes saving more difficult. I think that's a fact.
27-08-2020T12:44:02,CrRAR,"Yeah, right now houses are being built crazy and going crazy fast becase of low rates and because people are scared they might still lose jobs."
27-08-2020T12:44:19,CrRAR,...or prices of houses go higher.
27-08-2020T12:44:48,CrRAR,"Best to be in a house already losing a job, at least you can live in it a bit lol"
27-08-2020T12:45:33,AspiringNoodle,I am a little noodle with a little money nest :snake:
27-08-2020T12:46:14,CrimsonQuill,...can we please change the subject before the cynical depression engulfs us all?
27-08-2020T12:46:25,CrimsonQuill,Because right now I am biting down a rant.
27-08-2020T12:46:28,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-power:
27-08-2020T12:46:56,CrimsonQuill,The Wrath of Nibbly would be most welcome indeed as a distraction.

27-08-2020T12:47:46,CrimsonQuill,I want to make a Nibs train next sketch stream!
27-08-2020T12:49:51,CrimsonQuill,(I think I just proved my own point about impulse spending)

27-08-2020T12:51:04,AspiringNoodle,"If I could just get a whole month off when this is all over, that'd be great..."
27-08-2020T12:52:15,CrRAR,In the post-covid future WFH you might be able to work from ANYWHERE
27-08-2020T12:53:11,CrimsonQuill,"But then again, don't we lose something in the end?"
27-08-2020T12:53:21,CrRAR,probably
27-08-2020T12:53:25,CrimsonQuill,There is a certain serenity to being able to seperate your work from your home.
27-08-2020T12:53:40,CrimsonQuill,'A man's home is his castle...but it shouldn't have to be his fortress'
27-08-2020T12:53:53,CrRAR,"Yeah, this experience has been weird"
27-08-2020T12:53:53,CrimsonQuill,"'Dad', Calvin and Hobbes-Break in Arc"
27-08-2020T12:54:04,CrimsonQuill,I think it relates to work as well.
27-08-2020T12:54:16,CrRAR,"tbh, some hipster cities have “shared-work spaces”"
27-08-2020T12:54:16,CrimsonQuill,We shouldn't HAVE to do everything in our homes.
27-08-2020T12:54:47,CrRAR,"You like can go there to work it’s really just a giant empty, freelance office type thing"
27-08-2020T12:55:18,CrRAR,Kinda like how ppl use Starbucks but with out the coffee and more workspace amenities
27-08-2020T12:55:35,CrRAR,I’m sure some have full kitchens or whatever to make coffee and get snacks
27-08-2020T12:56:09,CrRAR,"I’m sure there’s some sort of membership fee I would think maybe, maybe the city subsidizes it somewhat"
27-08-2020T12:57:00,CrimsonQuill,Maybe.
27-08-2020T12:57:21,CrimsonQuill,"Anyway, I'm going to shower and watch a film. I'll drop back by before I go to bed."

27-08-2020T19:45:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I could go for pasta

27-08-2020T19:46:29,SpazztasticKiwi,or shrimp alfredo

27-08-2020T20:00:53,CrRAR,random AND sexy works too
