18-12-2020T00:02:53,NezumiYuki,I wonder of the girls realize that dragons have as good eyesight as someone with some binoculars?  Reni probably knows they are there juding by the way she's looking their way.  xD
18-12-2020T00:03:02,Ordithus,"Sage, today's Yosh! :ptv-hearts: wowza"
18-12-2020T00:03:39,SageSaga,it doesnt have as much of an impact when you know they are just teasing XD

18-12-2020T00:37:24,KipArto,How's things?
18-12-2020T00:37:48,CrRAR,both those things have great promise as band names
18-12-2020T00:37:52,KipArto,loving the mood music coming from Twokinds
18-12-2020T00:38:14,KeefMcDerpface,"Indeed, CrRAR."
18-12-2020T00:38:36,CrRAR,:violin::ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
18-12-2020T00:38:39,KipArto,I already have my band name picked out.
18-12-2020T00:38:43,KeefMcDerpface,Like something sold at Squirrel Mart.
18-12-2020T00:38:44,KipArto,Paper for Pens
18-12-2020T00:38:54,CrRAR,nice
18-12-2020T00:38:58,KipArto,now I just need to learn some instruments
18-12-2020T00:39:01,KipArto,XD
18-12-2020T00:39:49,Dadrobit,"Brb, gonna go make some ramen"
18-12-2020T00:39:55,KipArto,"well, Paper for Pens if I'm making an indie alternative/folk band. If I make a Rock/Metal band, it'll be Bleedproof"
18-12-2020T00:40:13,NezumiYuki,"Do it Dadro, I haz burrito in mah face right now!  xD"
18-12-2020T00:40:27,KeefMcDerpface,Was it good?
18-12-2020T00:40:43,NezumiYuki,Is good yes
18-12-2020T00:41:05,KipArto,I have been a huge anime fan/weeb for the longest time. I have still yet to try Ramen based solely on my personal dislike of soups.
18-12-2020T00:41:31,CrRAR,very noodly soup
18-12-2020T00:41:34,CrimsonHelsing,"Wait a minute, wasn't it still cloudy outside in the last page or two? (Light snowfall)"
18-12-2020T00:42:05,KipArto,cloudy can have open sky areas too
18-12-2020T00:42:09,CrRAR,it's like the slider between soup and noodle is like 95% the way to >NOODLE
18-12-2020T00:42:19,KipArto,XD
18-12-2020T00:42:31,CrRAR,weather in the wings of estate is different
18-12-2020T00:42:42,CrRAR,at least from inside perception
18-12-2020T00:42:49,KipArto,My hatred for Soup comes from your classic Chicken Noodle Soup.
18-12-2020T00:42:54,CrimsonHelsing,"Idk, these skies look suddenly much clearer than they were a second ago in the comic. Unless my eyes are playing tricks on me"
18-12-2020T00:42:57,CrRAR,like infirmary has snow!
18-12-2020T00:43:00,NezumiYuki,Udon are like that.  Udon is like 80 to 90% noodle but gosh is it good! <3
18-12-2020T00:43:53,CrRAR,"yeah, more stuff in soup, more better"
18-12-2020T00:44:11,KipArto,"I think about the ingredients for Chicken Noodle soup. Chicken, carrots, corn/peas, noodles.... all great things in their own right.... put into a pot and watered down to the point where they all taste like each other."
18-12-2020T00:44:22,CrimsonHelsing,"Heck I recall there was some heavy cloud cover in the outside view in the party page, and the epilogue page for chapter 20"
18-12-2020T00:44:23,Ordithus,taste delicious you mean
18-12-2020T00:44:33,CrRAR,the soup is their ESSENCE
18-12-2020T00:44:39,KeefMcDerpface,hah
18-12-2020T00:45:06,Ordithus,could be that dawn is breaking
18-12-2020T00:45:17,Ordithus,they were partying hard on the beach for a long time
18-12-2020T00:45:28,KipArto,"no, not delicious, deceiving. when I put Carrots in my mouth, I don't want to taste peas with a hint of chicken"
18-12-2020T00:45:57,CrRAR,I can see that
18-12-2020T00:46:03,Ordithus,well you're wrong :ptv-pouty:
18-12-2020T00:46:18,CrRAR,like soggy bread is bad
18-12-2020T00:46:28,CrRAR,I see how you can feel that way
18-12-2020T00:46:35,KeefMcDerpface,Is it chicken soup from a can or home made chicken soup?
18-12-2020T00:46:59,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-karenOOO:
18-12-2020T00:47:15,KipArto,i don't care. I hate the IDEA of soup
18-12-2020T00:47:20,KeefMcDerpface,ok
18-12-2020T00:47:43,CrRAR,what's your opinion on stew?
18-12-2020T00:47:55,KipArto,chunky soup. same deal
18-12-2020T00:48:03,CrRAR,logical
18-12-2020T00:48:16,CrRAR,at least it's not just complete mania
18-12-2020T00:48:25,CrRAR,what about... cereal?
18-12-2020T00:48:36,KipArto,"soup is actually, somehow, a worse offender for the stated reasons"
18-12-2020T00:48:36,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-confused:
18-12-2020T00:48:42,KipArto,Stew*
18-12-2020T00:48:48,CrRAR,tru
18-12-2020T00:49:07,Ordithus,so then what do you like to eat
18-12-2020T00:49:11,KipArto,Cereal is fine as long as you can finish it before the milk makes the cereal lose it's crunch
18-12-2020T00:49:47,CrRAR,ah okay
18-12-2020T00:49:51,SageSaga,thats why you dont eat cereal with milk
18-12-2020T00:49:55,NezumiYuki,Count Chocula is the Count of cereals!  And Cap'n Crunch with crunch berries is the Admiral of cereals!
18-12-2020T00:50:12,Ordithus,sage you monster
18-12-2020T00:50:14,SageSaga,you eat it dry- if you need it to be damp wait till the blood fills your mouth to soften it up
18-12-2020T00:50:20,Ordithus,haha
18-12-2020T00:50:25,KeefMcDerpface,Oh my.
18-12-2020T00:50:35,NezumiYuki,"yeah that sounds like crunch berries alright, Sage.  xD"

18-12-2020T00:50:42,KipArto,"ah yes, carbohydrate and blood soup"
18-12-2020T00:50:46,KipArto,XD
18-12-2020T00:51:03,NezumiYuki,Cinnamon Toast Crunch was another awesome cereal
18-12-2020T00:51:10,TheSexyBeast,"Milk in glass, cereal out of the box"
18-12-2020T00:51:16,KeefMcDerpface,^
18-12-2020T00:51:18,KipArto,you speak of CTC like it's no longer around

18-12-2020T00:52:37,NezumiYuki,"Tiggy Tony is still rocking it, I think.  Dem Frosted Flakes Yo"
18-12-2020T00:52:46,CrRAR,"yeah like ""was"" just begs the question like, 'What happened?'"
18-12-2020T00:52:48,KipArto,"and I love lots of food. Chicken dishes mainly, but I do experiment with different foods. I didn't try sushi until I was 30. when the Pandemic hit I cried that I couldn't turn into a sushi filled loaf anymore"
18-12-2020T00:52:51,CrRAR,:ptv-confused:

18-12-2020T02:01:52,Ordithus,most excellent
18-12-2020T02:02:07,Dadrobit,At first I was afraid the water damage was gonna rust the plate. Then I realized what I'd gotten.
18-12-2020T02:02:26,Dadrobit,"A rusty Mad Max poster would just have more ""character""."
18-12-2020T02:02:32,Ordithus,ha
18-12-2020T02:02:34,SageSaga,Acererak the Cambion Lich is on my wall
18-12-2020T02:02:37,BadFoMo,Haha!
18-12-2020T02:02:55,Dadrobit,"But I don't think any water got in, so it's a moot point."
18-12-2020T02:03:07,BadFoMo,That's good.
18-12-2020T02:03:12,Dadrobit,"Ah, and mounting is no issue with the supplies provided?"
18-12-2020T02:03:31,Ordithus,I have so many things to hang on my walls
18-12-2020T02:03:33,SageSaga,"got 4 magnets, 4 cleaning clothes, 4 templates-"
18-12-2020T02:05:36,Dadrobit,Kind of almost want to get one for myself. But I gotta do some budgeting now. Not gonna spend on anything frivolous until I figure out how bad my insurance hike actually hurt me.
18-12-2020T02:06:12,CrRAR,"yeah, not cool"
18-12-2020T02:06:33,Dadrobit,I think it's about $2500 a year now...
18-12-2020T02:08:21,CrRAR,"oh crap, I didn't realize like it's $80 a paycheck!?"
18-12-2020T02:08:36,Dadrobit,"Fuck my math, $3800."
18-12-2020T02:08:42,CrRAR,how could they do that w/o warning?
18-12-2020T02:08:49,CrRAR,that's insane
18-12-2020T02:08:58,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it fukkin blows."
18-12-2020T02:09:04,Ordithus,like my employer changed vacation policies starting january
18-12-2020T02:09:10,Ordithus,moving from lump sum to accrual
18-12-2020T02:09:18,CrRAR,whoopeee
18-12-2020T02:09:21,Ordithus,today was the first notice
18-12-2020T02:09:24,CrRAR,ohhh
18-12-2020T02:09:26,Dadrobit,But I know I need it because I'm planning on surgery this year...
18-12-2020T02:09:48,CrRAR,arg
18-12-2020T02:10:24,CrRAR,yeah I bet the actual effects of all this economic craziness is just beginning
18-12-2020T02:11:04,CrRAR,I feel like the covering done with the stimuluses is just stopping DIRECT effects
18-12-2020T02:11:35,CrRAR,so it's gonna be sneaky crap like this happening
18-12-2020T02:13:02,Dadrobit,"Wait, y'all have been getting stimulus?"
18-12-2020T02:13:10,CrRAR,xD
18-12-2020T02:16:10,CrRAR,oh wow apparently the runoffs in Georgia are having great turnouts as well
18-12-2020T02:16:27,CrRAR,could be good
18-12-2020T02:17:21,Dadrobit,"Yeah, seeing articles about record numbers of absentee ballot requests. Just need Dems to actually put in the vote."
18-12-2020T02:17:46,Dadrobit,"Tbh, I'm not getting my hopes up, but man would it be a nice as hell surprise."
18-12-2020T02:18:27,CrRAR,"yeah, honestly for ossoff it looked good because the 3rd party candidate had like near 2% of the vote"
18-12-2020T02:18:47,CrRAR,and the dif between was small between him and purdue
18-12-2020T02:19:12,CrRAR,if a good amt those folks just vote ossoff he'll get it
18-12-2020T02:19:34,CrRAR,I heard the other race is more of a longshot
18-12-2020T02:23:38,Dadrobit,"God, speaking of Independent, Florida still pisses me the fuck off with that the ""Rodriguez"" bullshit...."
18-12-2020T02:24:31,Dadrobit,"Lost by 34 votes because a ""Latinos for Trump"" advocate ran with the same name as the dem candidate and siphoned off thousands of votes...."
18-12-2020T02:24:57,Dadrobit,Absolutely infuriating
18-12-2020T02:25:10,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rainehappy:*[hehe]
18-12-2020T02:25:11,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
18-12-2020T02:25:13,Ordithus,night
18-12-2020T02:25:19,Dadrobit,o/ Ord
18-12-2020T02:28:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I heard this guy call stretch marks cinnamon toast crunch marks
18-12-2020T02:31:37,Dadrobit,1.1 million votes cast in Georgia so far.
18-12-2020T02:44:46,CrRAR,"Yeah I didn’t read into the article, just that the turnout is like general election levels"
18-12-2020T02:45:09,CrRAR,So he sain spazz she still lookin like a snacc
18-12-2020T02:45:16,CrRAR,lol
18-12-2020T02:45:54,CrRAR,But honestly that visual is TOO visual to be polite
18-12-2020T02:46:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve heard them called tiger stripes & lightning lines
18-12-2020T02:47:41,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s not one word for anything
18-12-2020T02:48:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m still confused how BB ate that tree bit
18-12-2020T02:49:00,CrRAR,Never underestmate determination
18-12-2020T02:49:33,CrRAR,"The only thing worse than a stupid person, is a determined stupid person"
18-12-2020T02:49:57,CrRAR,Not that I’m comparing cute bb to a stupid person
18-12-2020T02:50:04,SpazztasticKiwi,how dare
18-12-2020T02:50:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"when you see what it was, the size"
18-12-2020T02:50:49,SpazztasticKiwi,how was it appealing to eat
18-12-2020T02:50:59,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s no way it smelled or tasted good
18-12-2020T02:51:23,SpazztasticKiwi,but there’s also the fact I have a cat that chews on plastic straws
18-12-2020T02:51:29,CrRAR,"Wow, its like a piece of football turf"
18-12-2020T02:51:34,CrRAR,Ew
18-12-2020T02:52:54,SpazztasticKiwi,cat had people in a fuss like a celebrity’s kid went in the hospital
18-12-2020T02:53:45,CrRAR,“You have to save him. You HAVE to SaVE hIM!”
18-12-2020T02:53:53,CrRAR,*BLEUREG*
18-12-2020T02:54:04,CrRAR,:ptv-hearts:
18-12-2020T02:54:28,SpazztasticKiwi,gab posted pictures of the little sweet boi after a can of welcome home tuna
18-12-2020T02:54:57,SpazztasticKiwi,and then there’s Seán’s after picture: https://twitter.com/jack_septic_eye/status/1339907224177664000?s=21
18-12-2020T02:54:59,CrRAR,Maybe bb got a little too into pretending the piece was prey or something
18-12-2020T02:55:20,CrRAR,I saw the one w/ the 1000 yard stare xD
18-12-2020T02:55:33,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s rarely a time you’re excited for a cat hurling
18-12-2020T02:56:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"“I puked this one time and I’m in a photoshoot, what’s the difference this time?”"
18-12-2020T02:57:03,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s got little bits of fluff between his toesies
18-12-2020T02:57:35,CrRAR,Any extra warmth is appreciated these days
18-12-2020T02:57:48,Dadrobit,"Man, I have no idea who that is and much less their cat. But man, popularity is a crazy thing. I only knew about it because he's so popular that one of the microphone guys I follow mentioned it."
18-12-2020T02:58:11,CrRAR,Ha wow
18-12-2020T02:58:17,Dadrobit,"Like, the degrees of separation are miniscule nowadays."
18-12-2020T02:58:48,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s Jacksepticeyes cat
18-12-2020T02:59:11,SpazztasticKiwi,technically his girlfriends but they live together so he’s his too
18-12-2020T02:59:35,Dadrobit,"I am vaguely aware. It's just crazy to my how as someone who has zero interaction with that community, still ends up hearing things like this."
18-12-2020T02:59:42,Dadrobit,To me*
18-12-2020T03:00:19,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s the Seán guy I’m close to always talking about
18-12-2020T03:00:36,SpazztasticKiwi,has the cloak brand with Mark
18-12-2020T03:00:49,Dadrobit,"Yep, you're pretty much my only engagement with him."
18-12-2020T03:01:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I know it’s annoying
18-12-2020T03:01:16,CrRAR,Streamers are a big market for good microphones afterall
18-12-2020T03:01:24,Dadrobit,And I know Mark because everyone knows him lol.
18-12-2020T03:01:44,SpazztasticKiwi,but half the time I spill because this is where I can and it disappears eventually
18-12-2020T03:01:58,Dadrobit,They're also a good market for shitty or vastly overpriced mics as well.
18-12-2020T03:02:33,CrRAR,:rabbit2::tophat::sparkles:
18-12-2020T03:02:39,Dadrobit,"You would not believe the insane number of ""Made for streaming"" branded microphones have come out in the last few years."
18-12-2020T03:02:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t remember what he’s said his mic is but he said it was overkill for what he does
18-12-2020T03:02:57,Dadrobit,Neumann?
18-12-2020T03:03:16,Dadrobit,U87 or TLM 103 or something maybe?
18-12-2020T03:03:30,SpazztasticKiwi,.....
18-12-2020T03:03:39,Dadrobit,Do you have a picture of it?
18-12-2020T03:03:45,CrRAR,lol
18-12-2020T03:03:52,CrRAR,He wants the DEETS
18-12-2020T03:04:00,Dadrobit,I am CURIOUS!
18-12-2020T03:04:02,CrRAR,"Spazz, DEETSSSS"

18-12-2020T03:04:38,Dadrobit,If it's a SM7b I'll be disappointed. That mic is worth every penny for every application.
18-12-2020T03:04:48,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-kingtea:
18-12-2020T03:04:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I have screen shots from his videos but it’s top shots of it and then his face
18-12-2020T03:04:50,CrRAR,:cw0lfmare-ReniRawr: hey terra
18-12-2020T03:04:57,TerraTheWizard,mornin
18-12-2020T03:05:11,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s never really gone in on his equipment but a few times because there’s few people that understand
18-12-2020T03:05:15,CrRAR,:sunrise::ctwokinds-rainehappy:
18-12-2020T03:05:44,SpazztasticKiwi,his equipment does list per last update that it’s a Neumann U87 AI Microphone
18-12-2020T03:05:57,Dadrobit,Called it! \o/
18-12-2020T03:06:07,SpazztasticKiwi,so that means the answer to your question is yes
18-12-2020T03:06:08,CrRAR,Whoop
18-12-2020T03:06:13,Dadrobit,"So yes, it is overpriced lmfao"
18-12-2020T03:06:55,SpazztasticKiwi,he has started doing more voice stuff....maybe..
18-12-2020T03:07:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"& he’s said he wants to try more stuff like singing, or maybe that was Ethan"
18-12-2020T03:07:36,SpazztasticKiwi,could be the both of them
18-12-2020T03:07:42,Dadrobit,Still overpriced. A mic like the TLM 103 is more than enough at 1/3 or less the price.
18-12-2020T03:07:58,SpazztasticKiwi,he did say it was overkill
18-12-2020T03:08:46,SpazztasticKiwi,this reminds me when he posted his computer after busting the case
18-12-2020T03:09:37,Dadrobit,"That is a microphone intended entire for studios who already have platinum albums to their name, and the half a dozen voice actors who have more money than they know what to do with. 100% flex microphone."
18-12-2020T03:09:46,Dadrobit,Entirely*
18-12-2020T03:10:05,Dadrobit,"So what I'm saying is, I'm jelly"
18-12-2020T03:10:48,SpazztasticKiwi,screamy boy play video games
18-12-2020T03:11:13,Dadrobit,At least it's not a ribbon mic. That would've just been irresponsible.
18-12-2020T03:12:20,SpazztasticKiwi,in September he managed to do this https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/755925008617963540/image0.png

18-12-2020T03:13:51,SpazztasticKiwi,or he kicked it with his foot because cables
18-12-2020T03:14:40,Dadrobit,Hello reason number 37 why not to have tempered glass sides on my pc
18-12-2020T03:14:53,CrRAR,"Did the foot do it or did it rock one way and smash on the desk, I wonder?"
18-12-2020T03:15:03,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s just my guess
18-12-2020T03:15:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not sure if he ever said what happened

18-12-2020T03:19:44,Dadrobit,The Sony C800G. The most ridiculous looking microphone on the market. $10k new. $20k used because the microphone community is retarded.

18-12-2020T03:21:50,Dadrobit,The microphone comes with its own power supply to guarantee an exact amount of clean energy is powering it. And it has a giant dumb radiator on the back to ensure the internals stay at exactly the intended temperature.
18-12-2020T03:21:58,SpazztasticKiwi,they were sick but still moving around and it’s a good thing they could because both their husbands were literally bedridden with it
18-12-2020T03:22:41,Dadrobit,The microphone is basically removing as many outside variables as possible to ensure the delivered product is EXACTLY to spec.
18-12-2020T03:22:53,CrRAR,It has been said males are more likely to suffer worse symptoms
18-12-2020T03:23:09,Dadrobit,I got the shit kicked out of me for sure.

18-12-2020T14:21:53,Ordithus,he isn't back
18-12-2020T14:22:02,Ordithus,I assume he is under a pile of snow

18-12-2020T15:02:11,BadFoMo,Hi Hi.
18-12-2020T15:02:43,SageSaga,no my sister is trying to use my spotify account
18-12-2020T15:02:47,Vatruvius,Heya Sage! Just thought I drop by and see what is going on.
18-12-2020T15:03:19,SageSaga,yo just doing my work as usual
18-12-2020T15:03:26,sunblaze,oh fancy music go!
18-12-2020T15:04:37,Vatruvius,"Oh, well that is a new catgirl animation to me."
18-12-2020T15:05:26,sunblaze,the one on the bed?
18-12-2020T15:05:26,SageSaga,yep Maty did that for me for my Birthday
18-12-2020T15:09:45,SageSaga,she's trying to make Catgirl-Phil a thing as a way to Lewd me or something...
18-12-2020T15:10:06,Vatruvius,Hmm...is it working?
18-12-2020T15:10:43,SageSaga,ive drawn her a few times but nothing as lewd as like... holding- h- h- hands!
18-12-2020T15:11:36,SageSaga,that's a weeb joke
18-12-2020T15:11:43,Vatruvius,That would be the end of the world!
18-12-2020T15:11:52,Vatruvius,I figured.
18-12-2020T15:13:20,sunblaze,what would happen if both pics get combined?
18-12-2020T15:13:51,sunblaze,bed-bouncy phil-catgirl wiggeling legs?
18-12-2020T15:14:01,Ordithus,:csagesaga-bounce: yo!
18-12-2020T15:14:06,SageSaga,yo Ord
18-12-2020T15:14:16,Vatruvius,"Careful, you are heading towards universe creating thoughts."
18-12-2020T15:14:32,SageSaga,sunblaze- a lot of unnecessary and odd movement-
18-12-2020T15:14:40,sunblaze,christmas is close. wishes maaay be granted :P
18-12-2020T15:14:49,sunblaze,yeah that too
18-12-2020T15:15:01,Ordithus,bouncing and wiggling legs would be a good way of falling on her face
18-12-2020T15:18:08,SageSaga,I'd prefer she just work on the Nyna image so i can have a new Nyna emote too XD
18-12-2020T15:18:48,Vatruvius,Oh my god Sage...you just prevented my OCD for exploding. Thank you!
18-12-2020T15:19:03,SageSaga,o_O
18-12-2020T15:19:41,Ordithus,:csagesaga-c4: Nyna booty dance?
18-12-2020T15:20:00,SageSaga,yeah it would be a Nyna booty gif
18-12-2020T15:20:11,Ordithus,:ptv-excited:
18-12-2020T15:20:26,Almighty404,"After Nyna booty dance, Catgirl Phil booty dance ?"
18-12-2020T15:21:01,SageSaga,i have no control over what Maty actually does for me so- while i requested Nyna booty i have no idea if it will ever actually happen
18-12-2020T15:21:11,SageSaga,shes very busy and has a lot going on
18-12-2020T15:21:25,sunblaze,niiice
18-12-2020T15:21:37,SageSaga,and she wont accept payment for the gifs since she only does em as gifts
18-12-2020T15:22:33,Ordithus,means they are to be treasured all the more when they do happen
18-12-2020T15:22:46,Vatruvius,So true.
18-12-2020T15:26:51,SageSaga,...
18-12-2020T15:27:47,SageSaga,kids are leaving but they told Google to start playing music again on the home speaker
18-12-2020T15:28:33,Vatruvius,Up to some shenanigans are they?
18-12-2020T15:28:46,Ordithus,so that's why the music cut out
18-12-2020T15:28:48,SageSaga,ive only got one spotify account
18-12-2020T15:29:13,SageSaga,so it stops my music and starts playing theirs
18-12-2020T15:29:50,Vatruvius,Could you unlink your account from Google to stop that?
18-12-2020T15:30:27,NibblyBot,New Patreon Post: Submit Sketch Suggestions https://www.patreon.com/posts/submit-sketch-45224444
18-12-2020T15:30:39,Vatruvius,Though that could be a hassel if to set it back up every time after you stream.
18-12-2020T15:30:39,SageSaga,then it would be a pain for me when i wanted to listen to it on my google home system-
18-12-2020T15:32:21,Vatruvius,I have no idea if there is a passcode/admin style thing you can do where you have to say a passcode to access to the app from Google?
18-12-2020T15:33:32,Vatruvius,When I first heard Dan Vasc's version of this song I had to add it to my library. Nice.
18-12-2020T15:33:38,SageSaga,then my family couldnt properly use it- nah what i should do is get rid of spotify and get like youtube music with a family account
18-12-2020T15:34:30,Vatruvius,"If you have YouTube prrmium, yeah. A family YouTube premium."
18-12-2020T15:37:28,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-kingtea: tea
18-12-2020T15:37:36,Vatruvius,"I wish Picarto did the same thing as Netflix, Amazon, and YouTube where they thing the stream, movie, or video when you go to a different app on your phone so you can still watch/listen."
18-12-2020T15:37:38,SageSaga,mostly what i dont like is dealing with my sister being rude because she cant use my music while i am
18-12-2020T15:38:31,Vatruvius,"Well, what are siblings for? Pasteries and good times? That's a fantasy! XD"
18-12-2020T15:39:16,Vatruvius,I say this as an older brother. Each relationship has its moments.
18-12-2020T15:41:19,SageSaga,yeah well my sister is a spoiled brat that still throws hissyfits to get what she wants
18-12-2020T15:43:42,Vatruvius,Young then I assume? Most brats usually get their wings clipped when thrown into the real world on their own.
18-12-2020T15:48:04,SageSaga,shes older than me
18-12-2020T15:48:10,SageSaga,we arent kids-
18-12-2020T15:51:05,Ordithus,I lucked out on the sibling lottery. Both my brother and sister are great
18-12-2020T15:53:32,Vatruvius,"Well I didn't assume kids, but the brats I have seen stay that way until out of college, if they went, and have a job and house/apartment of their own for a couple years."
18-12-2020T15:54:31,Vatruvius,"Yeah, I lucked out too. Though we do have fights every once in a while."
18-12-2020T15:55:33,Vatruvius,There are 21 year old brats I still run into on campus...welll...back when campus was open.
18-12-2020T16:01:31,CrRAR,yeah it's one of those things where a behavior or attitude always worked for them so it continues
18-12-2020T16:02:10,Werewing,I've met brats in their 70s.
18-12-2020T16:07:50,Ordithus,they're better with mustard on em
18-12-2020T16:09:59,SageSaga,Ord...
18-12-2020T16:10:36,Ordithus,yes Sage :ctwokinds-keith8D:

18-12-2020T16:52:47,SageSaga,yo
18-12-2020T16:52:51,Twokinds,I really wish Picarto would implement sub gifting
18-12-2020T16:53:26,TeapotOfDoom,you mean like sub to a certain streamer?
18-12-2020T16:53:39,Twokinds,"Yeah like with twitch, where you can buy someone else a sub"
18-12-2020T16:54:16,TeapotOfDoom,just for people to buy each other subs in general or do you have something in mind to use it for?
18-12-2020T16:54:19,Twokinds,"I would have a typo bounty, and just give a free month to whoever first finds a typo."
18-12-2020T16:54:25,TeapotOfDoom,lol
18-12-2020T16:54:32,TeapotOfDoom,that'd probably go to terra
18-12-2020T16:54:46,TeapotOfDoom,only reason i was faster is he's asleep xD
18-12-2020T16:55:57,TeapotOfDoom,i mean to be honest you're probably one of the platforms biggest streamers. they even used your channel in official marketing
18-12-2020T16:56:27,TeapotOfDoom,if you were to ask there's a possibility they'd do it
18-12-2020T17:02:43,SageSaga,google is being kind of a dick
18-12-2020T17:02:51,TeapotOfDoom,how so?
18-12-2020T17:02:53,BadFoMo,How so?
18-12-2020T17:03:49,SageSaga,"it sent me a ""here's what you were doing around this time last year!"" and shows me pictures I took at the Amusement park with my family in a time before covid"

18-12-2020T17:15:06,BadFoMo,That's my hope.
18-12-2020T17:15:45,Twokinds,2021 is going to be amazing!

18-12-2020T17:21:00,BadFoMo,Here's hoping 2021 sees the end of the plage (not a pause)! ...And everything doesn't just blow up like SeaLab usually does in SeaLab 2021.
18-12-2020T17:21:46,AspiringNoodle,I imagine 2021 is gonna be just as bad simply because of the vaccine :|
18-12-2020T17:22:01,AspiringNoodle,People gonna be stupid BECAUSE of the vaccine
18-12-2020T17:22:10,TeapotOfDoom,as long as no strain that's immune to the vaccine appears and people who are vaccinated also can't spread it anymore it's mostly gonna be over in summer hopefully
18-12-2020T17:22:35,TeapotOfDoom,our gov has already published when people are gonna get vaccinated
18-12-2020T17:22:43,AspiringNoodle,Either gonna go throwing caution to the wind because they get vaccinated.  And then the other side of the coin is the people who are gonna REFUSE to get vaccinated
18-12-2020T17:22:44,TeapotOfDoom,getting my shot in april as it looks now
18-12-2020T17:23:24,AspiringNoodle,"And iirc, they don't know for certain if vaccinated individuals are incapable of spreading the virus further"
18-12-2020T17:23:42,TeapotOfDoom,yup exactly
18-12-2020T17:23:45,TeapotOfDoom,we'll see
18-12-2020T17:23:49,TeapotOfDoom,here's hope
18-12-2020T17:23:55,AspiringNoodle,So just because you get the vaccine means you don't get to suddenly stop wearing your mask and following other precautions :/
18-12-2020T17:25:22,BadFoMo,It just means that you can worry a little less and that the plage is on deathrow.
18-12-2020T17:25:29,BadFoMo,...Right?
18-12-2020T17:25:33,TeapotOfDoom,yup

18-12-2020T17:28:17,CrRAR,ok k
18-12-2020T17:28:48,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, I wouldn't be surprised if COVID eventually mutated into a new strain that the vaccines don't work on."
18-12-2020T17:28:49,Ordithus,\o/ ink'd
18-12-2020T17:29:05,AspiringNoodle,"Since, you know, the world has kinda let this thing run wild and it's already mutated *quite* a few times :/"
18-12-2020T17:29:07,Ordithus,"as far as I understand, it would be a heck of a mutation to do that"
18-12-2020T17:29:28,Ordithus,"the vaccine targets the spike proteins, which are how the virus interacts with human cells to begin with"
18-12-2020T17:29:34,AspiringNoodle,Did you know that they actually started tracking the spread of COVID based on the strain people have? xD
18-12-2020T17:29:36,Ordithus,and have been very stable
18-12-2020T17:30:01,AspiringNoodle,"It probably won't happen, but I wouldn't discount it."
18-12-2020T17:30:20,AspiringNoodle,Just because how poorly the world has dealt with its spread
18-12-2020T17:30:26,Ordithus,we've known about multiple strains of it at least since it first arrived in the US.
18-12-2020T17:30:26,TeapotOfDoom,there actually is a pretty dangerous strain where the spikes mutated
18-12-2020T17:30:31,TeapotOfDoom,afaik
18-12-2020T17:30:34,Ordithus,really? dang
18-12-2020T17:30:45,TeapotOfDoom,which lead to a bucha minks getting killed
18-12-2020T17:30:48,TeapotOfDoom,out of fear
18-12-2020T17:31:11,AspiringNoodle,"Is this the same strain as the new one that popped up in the UK recently, or is it old news?"
18-12-2020T17:31:35,Ordithus,wb!
18-12-2020T17:31:47,TeapotOfDoom,maybe dunno
18-12-2020T17:31:54,TeapotOfDoom,i only know they're afraid of it
18-12-2020T17:32:08,Ordithus,I remember the minks being a story like a month ago
18-12-2020T17:32:25,TeapotOfDoom,yup
18-12-2020T17:32:43,TeapotOfDoom,iirc that was because something got really dangerous
18-12-2020T17:33:10,AspiringNoodle,"So, basically that"
18-12-2020T17:33:38,AspiringNoodle,"People have been really stupid and downright political over a DISEASE, and it would be the ultimate karma if it bit us on the proverbial ass"
18-12-2020T17:33:44,TeapotOfDoom,so they did voluntary mass tests here after a lockdown
18-12-2020T17:33:48,TeapotOfDoom,noone went
18-12-2020T17:33:54,TeapotOfDoom,because why would they

18-12-2020T17:35:11,TeapotOfDoom,yeah not a good idea
18-12-2020T17:35:18,SpazztasticKiwi,also there’s stairs to the front door

18-12-2020T17:38:17,TeapotOfDoom,so gov offered free mas testings for christmas but closed down several sites because of low traffic last time (idiots) and today the registration website just died
18-12-2020T17:38:35,TeapotOfDoom,was down for 4 hours

18-12-2020T17:59:11,BadFoMo,Why did the elitorial collage vote for this guy again?
18-12-2020T17:59:30,CrRAR,the electorate spoke!
18-12-2020T17:59:58,SageSaga,because the electoral college votes for who the states tell them to 99% of the time
18-12-2020T18:00:06,TeapotOfDoom,my fav is still the Four Seasons incident
18-12-2020T18:00:06,Ordithus,because the electoral college is dumb
18-12-2020T18:00:28,CrRAR,"well, it does put a cap essentially on the voice of populated areas"
18-12-2020T18:00:41,CrRAR,to ensure that the rural places are heard
18-12-2020T18:01:05,CrRAR,it's the superdelegate system that's controversial
18-12-2020T18:01:12,SpazztasticKiwi,so I was hungry for lunch
18-12-2020T18:01:18,CrRAR,annnndddd?
18-12-2020T18:01:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I ate my whole lasagna
18-12-2020T18:01:32,SageSaga,yeah but that's why the senate has equal representation
18-12-2020T18:01:40,BadFoMo,99% of the time?! Sence when do they listen /that/ much?!
18-12-2020T18:01:41,CrRAR,ah
18-12-2020T18:01:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I normally just eat but the last few bits
18-12-2020T18:01:49,CrRAR,That's a good point sage
18-12-2020T18:02:00,SpazztasticKiwi,and I’m reminded now why
18-12-2020T18:02:02,CrRAR,but it is a different part of gov't
18-12-2020T18:02:07,SageSaga,what is more important for rural areas is local government
18-12-2020T18:02:12,CrRAR,true
18-12-2020T18:02:26,SageSaga,because lets face it- rural areas dont have a big impact on the nation as a whole
18-12-2020T18:02:32,CrRAR,yeah trying to change things with someone like trump for them is a fool's errand
18-12-2020T18:03:06,CrRAR,"freakin lasagna, yis"
18-12-2020T18:03:34,SageSaga,Trump isnt gonna get your neighbor to get that eyesore off his lawn- thats a local thing
18-12-2020T18:03:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"it’s like I told my mother - people that like him/voted for him either haven’t heard what all he’s said, what he’s done & how he acts or they don’t care, agree, or make excuses for him"
18-12-2020T18:04:14,SpazztasticKiwi,mom: hE’s AgAiNsT aBoRtIoN
18-12-2020T18:04:43,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s legit the reason she’s giving to be against biden
18-12-2020T18:05:02,SpazztasticKiwi,that she’s heard he’s prochoice
18-12-2020T18:05:06,SageSaga,everyone is against abortion- you think biden loves the idea of abortion?
18-12-2020T18:05:11,Ordithus,if satan was against abortion would she vote for satan
18-12-2020T18:05:16,CrRAR,"yeah, the bigger systemic problem is that most of those places were built up by old industry, since, the economics have changed to centralize production, you can't fix the overall trend of business consolidation and modernization"
18-12-2020T18:05:19,SageSaga,no one really likes abortion
18-12-2020T18:05:20,SpazztasticKiwi,man I don’t know
18-12-2020T18:05:40,SageSaga,we just think its necessary for the health and well being of some people
18-12-2020T18:05:48,SpazztasticKiwi,my eyes might jump out of my head at the amount of rolling they’ve done
18-12-2020T18:06:21,CrRAR,It's more about the choosing for someone something than about the actual topic
18-12-2020T18:06:26,SpazztasticKiwi,trying to explain something to her is like trying to get a straight answer out of trump
18-12-2020T18:06:26,TeapotOfDoom,:cteapotofdoom-cat_rotate: roll roll roll
18-12-2020T18:06:32,SageSaga,we would LIKE to educate people on things to prevent the need for  abortion more- but someone keeps telling people they cant even show kids how to put a condom on a banana!
18-12-2020T18:06:40,CrRAR,"but for the pro-lifers, they'll ALWAYS have the moral high-ground"
18-12-2020T18:07:14,CrRAR,that's what makes the politics of it hard
18-12-2020T18:07:28,SpazztasticKiwi,what she doesn’t agree with is that she contradicts herself
18-12-2020T18:07:33,SpazztasticKiwi,she’s pro life
18-12-2020T18:07:37,CrRAR,because the opposite stance is automatically a headline
18-12-2020T18:07:38,SageSaga,yeah so you want to show them their hypocrisy and show all the people that are pro-life getting abortions for their mistresses
18-12-2020T18:07:56,SpazztasticKiwi,but believes abortion is ok if it saves the mothers life/the baby isn’t viable
18-12-2020T18:08:07,SpazztasticKiwi,anybody else see the problem with that logic
18-12-2020T18:08:08,SageSaga,but they dont care if they  are hypocrites- all they care about is they say they are pro-life even if they dont practice it
18-12-2020T18:08:52,Ordithus,"without access to safe abortions by a professional, that won't stop abortions. it stops safe abortions. women die"
18-12-2020T18:09:05,CrRAR,yeah they will gather a following cuz that decision makes them SO pure and their hearts true~
18-12-2020T18:09:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"thanks to those dipshits & new laws, we still are"
18-12-2020T18:09:23,CrRAR,when they probably obviously are not for other harder to dicern reason
18-12-2020T18:09:31,CrRAR,*discern reasons
18-12-2020T18:09:48,AspiringNoodle,I discussed the abortion issue with myself a long time ago
18-12-2020T18:09:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"Alabama’s law means if my clothes say yes louder than I say no & the baby is healthy, I can’t abort"
18-12-2020T18:10:25,AspiringNoodle,"Ultimately, I decided pro-choice just because the Mother is the one who has to bear the burden, and pregnancy isn't 100% safe."
18-12-2020T18:10:43,SageSaga,"im pro-life, but i believe there is a medical and societal need for abortions (Because if you make them illegal it doesnt reduce the number of abortions- you just end up with less reputable methods and more mishaps)"
18-12-2020T18:10:43,CrRAR,"it is a difficult issue, and shouldn't be taken as a freedom to just be more irresponsible"
18-12-2020T18:10:46,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, it's a lot SAFER, but mostly because of medical intervention :|"
18-12-2020T18:11:03,TeapotOfDoom,i kinda like our solution
18-12-2020T18:11:10,TeapotOfDoom,basically says exactly what it should
18-12-2020T18:11:14,TeapotOfDoom,it's illegal
18-12-2020T18:11:18,SageSaga,so while im pro-life- im pro-choice XD
18-12-2020T18:11:21,CrRAR,"yeah sage, I think that's the problem was that like the drug problem, people will still find drugs"
18-12-2020T18:11:23,TeapotOfDoom,but there's no consequence
18-12-2020T18:11:48,TeapotOfDoom,so you can still go to a doctor but he's not obligated to do it
18-12-2020T18:11:57,TeapotOfDoom,or she
18-12-2020T18:12:09,CrRAR,so if it's tolerated at least people don't have to go to extreme circumstances when they find themselves in a bad situation
18-12-2020T18:12:23,TeapotOfDoom,which is always a bad idea
18-12-2020T18:12:36,TeapotOfDoom,give people professional care
18-12-2020T18:12:38,AspiringNoodle,There was a nation that legalized all hard drugs
18-12-2020T18:12:39,TeapotOfDoom,less will die
18-12-2020T18:12:40,SageSaga,"my goal as a pro-life person is to give people the ability to not need abortions in the first place, not to make them impossible to get safely"
18-12-2020T18:12:47,AspiringNoodle,And you know what happened?  Drug use PLUMMETED.
18-12-2020T18:12:55,CrRAR,yeah
18-12-2020T18:12:56,TeapotOfDoom,who would've thought
18-12-2020T18:12:56,Ordithus,Portugal?
18-12-2020T18:13:00,AspiringNoodle,I believe so
18-12-2020T18:13:05,TeapotOfDoom,the key to drugs is not to bad them
18-12-2020T18:13:07,AspiringNoodle,"To clarify: They legalized use, not so much sales"
18-12-2020T18:13:13,TeapotOfDoom,it's to help people get away from them
18-12-2020T18:13:19,Ordithus,They also offered rehab programs
18-12-2020T18:13:22,TeapotOfDoom,*ban
18-12-2020T18:13:32,TeapotOfDoom,my mom works in the field
18-12-2020T18:13:35,AspiringNoodle,"As such, they did everything they could to remove the stigma around drug use and encourage people to seek help for their addictions"
18-12-2020T18:13:51,AspiringNoodle,It's almost like shame and jail time are poor cures for physical addiction
18-12-2020T18:13:52,CrRAR,yeah other countries treat issues more holistically
18-12-2020T18:14:00,TeapotOfDoom,she's always furious if people start hard banning drugs and criminalizing people for it instead of helping them
18-12-2020T18:14:07,Ordithus,*some other countries
18-12-2020T18:14:12,TeapotOfDoom,^
18-12-2020T18:14:14,CrRAR,America is constantly guilty of doing Step 1 and stopping at most things
18-12-2020T18:14:22,AspiringNoodle,"Sadly, Biden isn't going to be that president :/"
18-12-2020T18:14:30,AspiringNoodle,He is vehemently anti-weed
18-12-2020T18:14:41,TeapotOfDoom,i mean that'd guy has his work cut out for him anyway
18-12-2020T18:15:09,SageSaga,is he Noodle?
18-12-2020T18:15:16,AspiringNoodle,Yes

18-12-2020T18:15:46,TeapotOfDoom,can't have everything i guess
18-12-2020T18:15:54,TeapotOfDoom,better than 4 years of circus
18-12-2020T18:15:57,AspiringNoodle,"""vehemently"" is probably an exaggeration, but Biden is not going to support legalizing weed.  If anything, he'd probably veto the bill if it managed to pass both chambers of congress"
18-12-2020T18:16:08,Ordithus,I find that unlikely
18-12-2020T18:16:12,TeapotOfDoom,^
18-12-2020T18:16:26,TeapotOfDoom,a president vetoing a bill like that would be very unusual
18-12-2020T18:16:27,SageSaga,he said he wants to decriminalize it
18-12-2020T18:16:32,SageSaga,like a few months ago
18-12-2020T18:16:44,SageSaga,that doesnt sound anti-weed
18-12-2020T18:17:17,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, I stand corrected then."
18-12-2020T18:17:34,Ordithus,he certainly supported anti-drug policies in the past
18-12-2020T18:17:39,Ordithus,"but he's had a long, long career"
18-12-2020T18:17:45,Ordithus,views evolve

18-12-2020T18:17:50,SageSaga,Biden does this thing-
18-12-2020T18:17:55,TeapotOfDoom,that's like the one thing that worries me
18-12-2020T18:18:03,SageSaga,where when he is given new information he changes his opinion
18-12-2020T18:18:08,TeapotOfDoom,oh no
