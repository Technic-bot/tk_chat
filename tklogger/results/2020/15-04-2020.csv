15-04-2020T00:00:14,Dadrobit,"Like. Dude. I fucking watched you move them myself. Remember when I asked you if you wanted help and you told me that you were just looking for something?"""
15-04-2020T00:00:20,SpazztasticKiwi,“just because it’s in the wrong area don’t mean the price rings wrong”
15-04-2020T00:00:36,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s what barcodes are for
15-04-2020T00:00:43,SpazztasticKiwi,they don’t lie
15-04-2020T00:00:53,AspiringNoodle,My store begs to differ :ptv-snicker:
15-04-2020T00:01:16,AspiringNoodle,"Helped a regular out because he bought two pieces of beef jerky (jack links), and before I told him the total, I noticed the price seemed off"
15-04-2020T00:01:20,Dadrobit,He ended up calling management. Most of the management had to come and hold a damn tribunal about whether I was telling the truth or not.
15-04-2020T00:01:47,AspiringNoodle,"As per usual, special was not ringing up.  Ended up saving the dude $3 :D"
15-04-2020T00:02:01,Dadrobit,Ended up that the front end management and the floor management believed me because they all knew me/the regular assholes.
15-04-2020T00:02:01,AspiringNoodle,"You: ""Look at the damn tapes!"" ???"
15-04-2020T00:02:27,AspiringNoodle,Nice
15-04-2020T00:03:31,Dadrobit,But still the store director and his cronies that barely touched the front end found it impossible that a customer could ever be wrong and that clearly the bags were misplaced by a stocker and that I should be ashamed of myself for calling a customer a li
15-04-2020T00:03:41,Dadrobit,liar*
15-04-2020T00:03:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"on customers, those wearing masks and gloves or even if they’re not & they’re wiping everything down and watching what they touch, they need to watch their kids"
15-04-2020T00:04:17,AspiringNoodle,Wow... you have to be completely naive to think that every single customer is telling the truth and is a perfect little angel who could do no wrong...
15-04-2020T00:04:38,AspiringNoodle,"WRONG.  There are a lot of people who will try to lie, cheat, steal, and otherwise take advantage of you every chance you get.  They're rare, but they exist."
15-04-2020T00:04:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"girl I was with today said she saw a kid press his hands on the glass of the hot case, smush his face on it, and then touch his face"
15-04-2020T00:05:10,AspiringNoodle,Shame the glass wasn't red hot metal
15-04-2020T00:05:11,Dadrobit,"Thank fuck my immediate management had my back and shut them down. Straight up called out the regular assholes for what they were: known asshole thieves. After that, the guy decided he didn't want rice anyways and left."
15-04-2020T00:05:19,AspiringNoodle,At least his face would be disinfected :ptv-snicker:
15-04-2020T00:05:40,AspiringNoodle,^^^ Mark of a criminal
15-04-2020T00:05:56,AspiringNoodle,Act offended when caught red handed and play the victim then leave
15-04-2020T00:06:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I have seen parents tut tut at their kids for touching the glass because of fingerprints but others damn near let them fingerpaint on the doors
15-04-2020T00:07:45,AspiringNoodle,"Dadro, please tell me the store had a camera pointed at the area in question..."
15-04-2020T00:08:11,AspiringNoodle,So they could shove it in the director's face...
15-04-2020T00:09:05,Dadrobit,"Sure, but it never got that far. Dude just left and everyone went back to whatever they were doing."
15-04-2020T00:12:08,SpazztasticKiwi,worst customer I may have so far is the lady who hadn’t decided on anything yet so I told her to just tell me when she was ready and I’d get her
15-04-2020T00:12:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"she mentions she’s ready when my manager is closer and because she’s also closer, offers to take it for me"
15-04-2020T00:13:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"but the lady says “oh but she was gonna get me”, pointing at me"
15-04-2020T00:13:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"now, this isn’t inherently bad until you learn that I am white"
15-04-2020T00:13:24,SpazztasticKiwi,but my manager is not
15-04-2020T00:13:28,AspiringNoodle,oh shit xD
15-04-2020T00:14:18,AspiringNoodle,I sense that the customer was also white
15-04-2020T00:23:58,BlackjackSec99,"we get that a lot at the hardware store, except its that we have a female manager and a bunch of white 'cowboys' for a town population. She gets ignored or disregarded all the time. The whole team has now learned that in those situations"
15-04-2020T00:24:11,BlackjackSec99,"even if we know the answer, ask her the question and go with her answer"
15-04-2020T00:25:24,BlackjackSec99,"train the old sexist bastards that yes, women can be really knowledgeable with 'manly' things like what concrete to use, how to change a light switch, or install a garbage disposal."
15-04-2020T00:25:58,AspiringNoodle,Or how to shoot a gun? c:
15-04-2020T00:26:30,BlackjackSec99,"eh, shes not really into it... but she used to be one hell of a street racer"
15-04-2020T00:26:44,SpazztasticKiwi,that reminds me of when I went to the car dealership for a car maybe a year back
15-04-2020T00:27:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"told the dude straight off, ~because he asked~, I specifically wanted something truck or car like, NO suvs"
15-04-2020T00:27:34,BlackjackSec99,"did you get the run-around, and the patronizing talk like you didnt know jack?"
15-04-2020T00:27:37,SpazztasticKiwi,what was the first thing he walks me over to?
15-04-2020T00:28:15,AspiringNoodle,SUV? >_>
15-04-2020T00:28:46,AspiringNoodle,"""I want a truck OR a car, not that unholy abomination that is the inbetween."""
15-04-2020T00:28:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"after almost snapping that I did not want this car, even after humoring him with a test drive, I walked off to some cars off to the side"
15-04-2020T00:29:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"a beautiful red cruze sat there, fresh tires, all clean and shiny"
15-04-2020T00:29:28,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-excited:
15-04-2020T00:29:38,BlackjackSec99,... a Cruze?
15-04-2020T00:29:41,BlackjackSec99,what engine?
15-04-2020T00:29:53,SpazztasticKiwi,told him I liked it but I wasn’t sure about the tint because it was so dark and you could only go so dark before it became illegal
15-04-2020T00:30:11,SpazztasticKiwi,and this dude pipes in with a way too excited “that’s right!”
15-04-2020T00:30:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"I do t know the engine, he couldn’t let me in or try it cause it was one they hadn’t registered to sell yet"
15-04-2020T00:31:08,BlackjackSec99,"ahhh, okie dokie"
15-04-2020T00:31:35,SpazztasticKiwi,the insistence he had that I take the suv tho
15-04-2020T00:31:44,SpazztasticKiwi,wanted to choke him
15-04-2020T00:31:52,SpazztasticKiwi,“I’ll take off $500”
15-04-2020T00:32:02,AspiringNoodle,Must suck to be a cars salesman these days
15-04-2020T00:32:04,SpazztasticKiwi,“there’s a lifetime service warranty”
15-04-2020T00:32:07,BlackjackSec99,"yeah, thats the same reason girls dont exist online. The subconscious chanting in the dark recesses of the male mind... ""girl... girl... girl...."""
15-04-2020T00:32:12,AspiringNoodle,"Because of the internet, people have access to all the information in the world..."
15-04-2020T00:32:33,SpazztasticKiwi,the guy went to high school with my sister
15-04-2020T00:33:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"so he’s at the most 5 years older than me, but I’ll tell you what, the general knowledge I do have on cars can turn heads"
15-04-2020T00:34:27,AspiringNoodle,All I know is that I love my little focus c:
15-04-2020T00:34:39,BlackjackSec99,"thats not hard... guys in general STILL think girls cant possibly know about cars. or motorcycles. or mechanics, or gaming......"
15-04-2020T00:34:42,AspiringNoodle,I want to get it detailed when all this nonsense ends.  Give it the love it deserves...
15-04-2020T00:35:08,BlackjackSec99,Focus? :ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:
15-04-2020T00:35:19,BlackjackSec99,year? model? engine?
15-04-2020T00:35:33,AspiringNoodle,"It's amazing what 13 years of engineering can do.  This thing has 40 less horsepower than my now dead 2001 escape, but is overal faster, and has WAY better mileage"
15-04-2020T00:35:48,SpazztasticKiwi,is it bad that now I’m imagining you as an older gollum
15-04-2020T00:35:56,BlackjackSec99,LOL
15-04-2020T00:36:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"“yis, the precious cars..”"
15-04-2020T00:36:07,AspiringNoodle,Shame that Ford isn't making cars (outside of Mustangs) anymore
15-04-2020T00:36:42,BlackjackSec99,"Im not in as deep as I used to be but I still love cars, and anyone who has cars that Ive had or have is immediately interesting to me"
15-04-2020T00:37:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"I have no clue if the dealership is open but before the apocalypse, I was looking at a red avalanche"
15-04-2020T00:37:30,AspiringNoodle,Will probably go Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla next
15-04-2020T00:37:46,AspiringNoodle,"Went from SUV -> Compact.  Love the compact, miss the hatch. lol"
15-04-2020T00:38:02,BlackjackSec99,"yeah, but it makes sense for Ford. its too hard to compete with Toyota, Mazda, Honda and Subie in the car game, so they focused on what they do best. suvs and TRUCKS"
15-04-2020T00:38:47,BlackjackSec99,"Ehhhhhh Spazz, I may be a little biased, but avoid anything Chevy made since 01-02"
15-04-2020T00:39:14,BlackjackSec99,thats when their quality and more importantly reliability went to crap
15-04-2020T00:40:11,SpazztasticKiwi,my mother’s so uppity about foreign cars I’m set to try getting a kia in orange or blue with halogens just to piss her off
15-04-2020T00:40:19,BlackjackSec99,they STILL cant get their electric steering correct and their engines are a crapshoot as to if it will last 500k miles or 50k....
15-04-2020T00:40:22,SpazztasticKiwi,and ensure she’ll never want to drive it
15-04-2020T00:40:34,BlackjackSec99,lol nice
15-04-2020T00:40:49,BlackjackSec99,Hyundai in the last 10 years have actually become really good cars
15-04-2020T00:40:51,AspiringNoodle,"Hmmm, might go with Honda Civic"
15-04-2020T00:41:10,BlackjackSec99,honda and toyota are legendary for reliable
15-04-2020T00:41:15,AspiringNoodle,The 2020 version has a 174 hp engine that gets 31 / 40 mpg
15-04-2020T00:41:19,SpazztasticKiwi,she hates halogens which is fair since they can see for 100 years but the rest of us are blinded
15-04-2020T00:41:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"as for the color choices, she loves Alabama football"
15-04-2020T00:41:43,AspiringNoodle,"And it's available for the hatchback.  Keep it up Honda, and my next car will probably be yours, lol"
15-04-2020T00:41:49,BlackjackSec99,nissan is really meh at the moment....
15-04-2020T00:41:54,SpazztasticKiwi,their colors are red white and grey
15-04-2020T00:42:04,AspiringNoodle,"Black, I'm the kinda guy who will use something until it dies."
15-04-2020T00:42:09,BlackjackSec99,"So, blue, orange or lime green?"
15-04-2020T00:42:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"the total opposite team and top rival is auburn, who are orange blue and white"
15-04-2020T00:42:39,AspiringNoodle,"Had to get rid of the escape a few years ago because the frame was starting to rust away.  Combine that with leaks in the engines and increasing rate of repairs, and the thing just wasn't worth it"
15-04-2020T00:42:39,BlackjackSec99,blue or orange then lol
15-04-2020T00:43:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"ergo, foreign car, blue with orange stripes, and halogen lights"
15-04-2020T00:43:04,SpazztasticKiwi,fight me
15-04-2020T00:43:35,BlackjackSec99,HID or LED lights would be even better ;-)
15-04-2020T00:43:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"I do like the kia, but I want a truck"
15-04-2020T00:43:44,AspiringNoodle,"Black, call me crazy, but I want to buy a new car at some point"
15-04-2020T00:43:58,AspiringNoodle,And then love it and drive it until it's no longer financially responsible to keep it xD
15-04-2020T00:44:17,BlackjackSec99,"toyota, ford f series, or ranger if you can find one in good shape."
15-04-2020T00:44:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not a fan of Toyota
15-04-2020T00:45:06,BlackjackSec99,noodle... dont do that... that IS crazy.... My parents bought an 05 focus new. Its now got only 140k on it and is worth $1200.
15-04-2020T00:45:17,AspiringNoodle,Why not Tonka? :snail:
15-04-2020T00:45:27,SpazztasticKiwi,guy I graduated with died in a tacoma
15-04-2020T00:45:30,AspiringNoodle,And did you listen to me?  xD

15-04-2020T00:46:16,AspiringNoodle,"I'm not one of those idiots who buys cars model year new, then trades them in a few years down the road for the newest version"
15-04-2020T00:46:39,AspiringNoodle,That 2001 escape lasted until 2018.
15-04-2020T00:46:49,AspiringNoodle,I'm hoping this 2014 Ford Focus lasts until 2030 :snail:
15-04-2020T00:47:16,BlackjackSec99,"If you are set on Chevy, sure, just.... the past 6 friends who went chevy built after 04 had dead vehicles in a rather short period of time...."
15-04-2020T00:48:07,AspiringNoodle,There's a youtube mechanic
15-04-2020T00:48:13,AspiringNoodle,"I can't remember his name, I think it's Scotty"
15-04-2020T00:48:22,AspiringNoodle,"Dude's been a mechanic for DECADES, and he'll steer you right"
15-04-2020T00:48:39,AspiringNoodle,Got some interesting insight on the car world thanks to him
15-04-2020T00:49:49,BlackjackSec99,"like, as much as I love my 03 SVT focus, I couldnt recommend owning one because working on it is #$% #$%^^#^  #%#@^& sdf#%^@%^n 2ART        $#%^^@!!!"
15-04-2020T00:49:50,BlackjackSec99,?

15-04-2020T00:50:39,SpazztasticKiwi,my last boyfriend was a mechanic
15-04-2020T00:50:51,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s what he sounded like alot
15-04-2020T00:51:01,BlackjackSec99,"like, who TF decided putting an alternator UNDER the intake manifold, on the firewall side of the engine needs to be stabbed in the eye with a really hot french fry"
15-04-2020T00:51:24,AspiringNoodle,But 2014 Ford Focus ST.  Ruby red.  Nice new Firestone WeatherGrip tires <3
15-04-2020T00:51:40,BlackjackSec99,"oh, an ST?"
15-04-2020T00:51:40,SpazztasticKiwi,he also hated gmcs with a passion
15-04-2020T00:51:42,AspiringNoodle,Just need to get it all nice and shiny and waterproof / rust resistant
15-04-2020T00:51:55,BlackjackSec99,AKA Mazdaspeed 3 with slightly different looks

15-04-2020T00:53:35,AspiringNoodle,"I'm still in love with the fact that it's slightly faster than the escape, but gets near double the mileage"
15-04-2020T00:53:39,AspiringNoodle,14 / 22 -> 27 / 37
15-04-2020T00:53:53,AspiringNoodle,"Wish I had this thing during my college years, lol"

15-04-2020T00:57:14,BlackjackSec99,"they drive like a small car rather than an SUV and get killer milage, super reliable, space for stuff and people, you can CAMP in one because the entire back area folds flat and parts are cheap."
15-04-2020T00:57:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I got me & 2 cats
15-04-2020T00:57:37,Dadrobit,"Yeah, just tried watching a video of his again to see if he's different. Nope, I just can't listen to his cadence."
15-04-2020T00:58:02,AspiringNoodle,"Wasn't too big on the CRV.  Looked nice, felt comfortable to drive in"
15-04-2020T00:58:12,AspiringNoodle,"But compared to the Focus, the acceleration felt like it lagged"

15-04-2020T00:58:29,BlackjackSec99,"well, yeah, most things will compared to an ST"

15-04-2020T01:00:13,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s like math: where’d all the letters come from
15-04-2020T01:00:33,AspiringNoodle,"When I got the focus back in 2018, after taxes / dealer fees, we paid about $8200 for a 2014 with ~93k miles"
15-04-2020T01:01:02,BlackjackSec99,"well, lots of them are just Legacy designations... SE used to be Special Edition, S was Sport, RS was Rally Sport, etc...."
15-04-2020T01:01:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I did have more of an eye on a rogue
15-04-2020T01:01:35,BlackjackSec99,"Honda has always used LX, DX, EX, VX, HX etc to designate trim levels..."
15-04-2020T01:01:47,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s lime green & I loved it
15-04-2020T01:01:55,BlackjackSec99,"my manager has one, nice little SUV and quick"
15-04-2020T01:02:04,SpazztasticKiwi,but it was listed $11500
15-04-2020T01:02:13,SpazztasticKiwi,for a 2017
15-04-2020T01:02:28,BlackjackSec99,"noodle, not bad for a 14, but the miles is a little steep for the price"
15-04-2020T01:02:46,BlackjackSec99,thats not bad at all for a 17
15-04-2020T01:02:54,AspiringNoodle,"Believe it or not, where I lived, it's the best deal I could find xD"
15-04-2020T01:02:55,SpazztasticKiwi,car fax showed a total loss wreck
15-04-2020T01:03:02,BlackjackSec99,....
15-04-2020T01:03:04,BlackjackSec99,not good
15-04-2020T01:03:06,SpazztasticKiwi,front frame damage
15-04-2020T01:03:13,BlackjackSec99,"yep, no go"
15-04-2020T01:03:27,SpazztasticKiwi,and it’d been stolen at one point
15-04-2020T01:03:39,AspiringNoodle,"Everything else that was listed was either super high mileage (150k+), or super old (2008 or earlier)"
15-04-2020T01:03:45,BlackjackSec99,"sometimes they are Salvage from stupid things that arent important, but structural damage is a no-go for me"
15-04-2020T01:03:51,AspiringNoodle,^
15-04-2020T01:04:06,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, they shouldn't be able to sell vehicles with frame damage"
15-04-2020T01:04:12,AspiringNoodle,Its safety is compromised
15-04-2020T01:04:18,BlackjackSec99,"yeah, exactly"
15-04-2020T01:04:30,AspiringNoodle,It's one thing if you own the vehicle and want it repaired
15-04-2020T01:04:42,AspiringNoodle,"But a lot of places will either try to hide the damage, or not mention it at all"
15-04-2020T01:04:51,AspiringNoodle,Because they KNOW it's a deal killer
15-04-2020T01:05:14,BlackjackSec99,"even if its okish safety wise, you never know if it will ever be in alignment again... it might chew through tires like you wouldnt believe, or have handling issues you dont know about untill you need to avoid something"
15-04-2020T01:05:22,SpazztasticKiwi,the accident report says it ran off the road ether after something got up underneath and caused loss of control or loss of control occurred and then something got under there
15-04-2020T01:05:58,BlackjackSec99,"lol, yeah, NEXT"
15-04-2020T01:06:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"then it went into a ditch, totaling the front, and entire passenger side door area"
15-04-2020T01:06:37,SpazztasticKiwi,airbag deployment noted
15-04-2020T01:06:47,BlackjackSec99,oh... crud... its late... I need to get to bed...
15-04-2020T01:07:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"vehicle disabled, had to be towed"
15-04-2020T01:08:03,BlackjackSec99,"yeah. no go on the rogue lol, that things not safe"
15-04-2020T01:08:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"it’s still up, for $10900"
15-04-2020T01:08:15,AspiringNoodle,Just come back every week
15-04-2020T01:08:20,AspiringNoodle,The price will keep going down
15-04-2020T01:08:41,AspiringNoodle,Frame damage is a huge deal killer in the car world
15-04-2020T01:08:43,BlackjackSec99,"alright, ive really got to get to bed. Goodnight all!"
15-04-2020T01:08:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"they did amazing on the restoration - without the report, you’d not know it was trashed"
15-04-2020T01:09:12,AspiringNoodle,"Hmmm, interesting"
15-04-2020T01:09:26,AspiringNoodle,"If they did that great a job, it makes me wonder how good a job they did repairing the frame..."
15-04-2020T01:09:37,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s what disappointed me about it other than the insane price
15-04-2020T01:10:45,AspiringNoodle,"I still think the Focus was the best buy I could make, tbh"
15-04-2020T01:11:04,AspiringNoodle,"I remember when looking around, I *could* find cheaper options"
15-04-2020T01:11:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"I know enough to look at the car fax, and one flag to check for is frame damage"
15-04-2020T01:11:16,AspiringNoodle,But those vehicles were generally 150k+ miles and 2008 or earlier
15-04-2020T01:11:47,AspiringNoodle,What the 93k on the focus told me was that the car was driven heavily in a 4 - 5 year period
15-04-2020T01:12:08,SpazztasticKiwi,what I’d really love is a tesla
15-04-2020T01:12:14,AspiringNoodle,But odds are it was a lot of highway driving
15-04-2020T01:12:36,SpazztasticKiwi,take Bagheera on car trips
15-04-2020T01:12:44,AspiringNoodle,"Because 12 - 15k a year is considered average, but this car was doing 19 - 23k"
15-04-2020T01:13:22,AspiringNoodle,It's kinda hard to put that kind of mileage on a card without doing mostly highway xD
15-04-2020T01:14:10,AspiringNoodle,"For reference, when I was in college, a single day of driving to / from campus was ~100 miles"
15-04-2020T01:14:30,AspiringNoodle,"On average, I drove 4 days a week for 15 weeks"
15-04-2020T01:14:49,AspiringNoodle,So a whole year of college was roughly 12k miles for me

15-04-2020T11:36:38,AspiringNoodle,"Right now, I'm in the most tedious part, creating the new blank entries"

15-04-2020T11:38:58,AspiringNoodle,"25 - 26 mouse clicks, 4 enter presses, and 6 presses of a side button on my mouse.  Plus some scrolling"
15-04-2020T11:39:36,AspiringNoodle,Because I have to create each new entry from scratch with this backend.  No easy little template setup for me <3
