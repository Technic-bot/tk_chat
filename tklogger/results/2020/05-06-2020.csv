05-06-2020T01:18:22,Dadrobit,Target practice for Tom later.
05-06-2020T01:18:23,SageSaga,see- i would have told it more like this- there once was a happy family of owlbears! They made their home in a beached ship from many many years ago. They had 6 little owl bear eggs ready and waiting to be hatched- when suddenly- Tom's Paladin character
05-06-2020T01:18:23,Mihari,Dragons would need accept being a pet in any D&D world XD
05-06-2020T01:18:25,SageSaga,arrived!

05-06-2020T01:18:59,BlackjackSec99,ohhh owlbears... missed that bit....
05-06-2020T01:19:35,SageSaga,the father owlbear tried desperately to cover and protect the eggs as the paladin slashed into its back over and over with his longsword!
05-06-2020T01:19:44,SageSaga,his wife- dead on the ground behind him
05-06-2020T01:20:07,LittleNapoleon,This got dark :(

05-06-2020T01:20:27,Dadrobit,"Tom can't kill his own characters anymore, so he takes it out on his D&D campaign instead lmao"
05-06-2020T01:20:28,SageSaga,the paladin - even with the owlbear not attacking back- continued to drive steel into flesh! Till his spirit broke and left his children behind

05-06-2020T02:07:03,SageSaga,yeah- it has built in controls and macros for different saved settings
05-06-2020T02:07:15,SageSaga,so you can do vocal manipulation with it-
05-06-2020T02:07:27,SageSaga,so i can set up voices for DnD characters
05-06-2020T02:07:31,PurpleLemons,a little yes Anu :)
05-06-2020T02:08:03,Dadrobit,"Ohhhh, functional."
05-06-2020T02:08:12,PurpleLemons,I have to finish Page 3 by this month so I can release what I have so far to Pareon

05-06-2020T02:08:22,SageSaga,well i havent check Mexico yet-
05-06-2020T02:08:28,PurpleLemons,it's a small and slow start but it's getting there :fire:
05-06-2020T02:08:30,Kameloh,lol this song is part of a 3 hour video

05-06-2020T02:12:59,johnnytho,cloudy in my area :(
05-06-2020T02:15:59,Kameloh,these song is such a meme
05-06-2020T02:16:32,Dadrobit,"Watching a review of the goxlr right now from someone I quite trust, and it actually looks like a fun piece of gear!"
05-06-2020T02:17:40,Dadrobit,"Can't say I'd have any practical use for it myself, but for being a D&D attachment, man, I could really see it doing work."
05-06-2020T02:18:37,SageSaga,but again- not a one available at stock price in the entire US and Canada
05-06-2020T02:19:49,Dadrobit,eBay? There's a treasure trove of audio gear that was only used once or twice by folks who didn't know what they were doing.
05-06-2020T02:20:04,SageSaga,none at normal price or lower
05-06-2020T02:20:33,Dadrobit,Really? Dang...
05-06-2020T02:20:49,SageSaga,"found em for over 500, even amazon has one... for a thousand"
05-06-2020T02:22:30,PurpleLemons,I think it's gotten hotter in my room :frog:
05-06-2020T02:22:36,Kameloh,whaat
05-06-2020T02:22:44,Kameloh,could take a break D:
05-06-2020T02:22:54,PurpleLemons,I will take a slight break to walk a little
05-06-2020T02:22:55,SageSaga,how hot is it there?
05-06-2020T02:23:15,Ordithus,have good break purp
05-06-2020T02:23:19,PurpleLemons,well my fan says it's 89 in my room and humidity at about 50%
05-06-2020T02:23:27,Ordithus,yikes
05-06-2020T02:23:36,PurpleLemons,i'm suprised i'm not sweating
05-06-2020T02:23:41,Kameloh,D:
05-06-2020T02:24:12,SageSaga,whats the temp outside?
05-06-2020T02:24:42,Dadrobit,Holy shit fuck. Just started looking at prices myself. $400 MSRP. Only one available on Amazon is that $1k one.
05-06-2020T02:25:09,SageSaga,is the MSRP 400? I thought it was 500- i was ready to pay 500...
05-06-2020T02:25:22,PurpleLemons,86 feels like 77 but i've had my window open this whole time
05-06-2020T02:25:52,PurpleLemons,"I think I get really restless on full moons too, thinking back I think I always have problems sleeping on them xD"
05-06-2020T02:26:27,SageSaga,ok what ya gotta do is dig a 3 foot hole under your room about the size of your room- then have a hole in the roof. then a small channel outside into the hole
05-06-2020T02:26:53,Dadrobit,It's really shocking how expensive it is. You can get full featured mixing boards with 16 full channels and fx sections for like $300.
05-06-2020T02:27:25,SageSaga,if you can find me one that is a match for the go XLR i'll look into it XD
05-06-2020T02:27:51,Kameloh,getting lazy :eyes:
05-06-2020T02:29:05,SageSaga,the hole thing i mentioned is a form of ancient air conditioning- it could lower a rooms temp by about 10-15 degrees so long as its not already under 70F
05-06-2020T02:29:55,PurpleLemons,me too Kame
05-06-2020T02:29:56,Ordithus,this time of year I can ask everyone else why they live where they do
05-06-2020T02:30:03,Kameloh,purp it's so late there
05-06-2020T02:30:04,Ordithus,haha shoe is on the other foot now
05-06-2020T02:30:09,Dadrobit,"Dunno about a match. The goxlr is... Professionally speaking, kind of a gimmick box. A really fun looking gimmick box with some specific use cases. But not something that is widely produced across brands."
05-06-2020T02:30:19,PurpleLemons,if I dig a hole Sage i'd fall to the condo below me :snail:
05-06-2020T02:30:42,SageSaga,is the AC broken?
05-06-2020T02:31:09,PurpleLemons,yup
05-06-2020T02:31:10,PurpleLemons,broke today
05-06-2020T02:31:19,SageSaga,you rent?
05-06-2020T02:31:23,Dadrobit,"I know Roland makes something similar with voice modulation, but doesn't include software with things like samples."
05-06-2020T02:31:31,Dadrobit,Yamaha too I think.
05-06-2020T02:31:37,PurpleLemons,"yes and landlord was over today doing what he could, he's gonna make some calls tomorrow"
05-06-2020T02:32:10,Dadrobit,"I'll spend a bit of time looking though, maybe there's something out there that won't break the bank?"

05-06-2020T02:34:13,PurpleLemons,gnight Anu
05-06-2020T02:34:13,Kameloh,how do you write lore
05-06-2020T02:34:17,SageSaga,software voice changers are usually not very good- so id like a device that can handle it along with my XLR mic and heaphones
05-06-2020T02:34:22,PurpleLemons,you start Kame :snail:

05-06-2020T02:35:14,Dadrobit,"Problem is, that with podcasting really taking off in the last decade or so, every brand and their mother took regular gear like mics and small mixers, threw ""pod"" or ""podcaster"" in the name and jacked up the price to take advantage of the scene."
05-06-2020T02:35:45,SageSaga,to write lore you need to come up with a world and think about how things are different and how the people act and socialize and if there are gods or magic and come up with all the rules and think of all the strange interactions-
05-06-2020T02:35:50,Dadrobit,"So a ton of mass produced, questionable quality ""pro-sumer"" gear is out there cluttering up the space."

05-06-2020T02:41:31,Kameloh,I used to write more when I was in like... high school XD

05-06-2020T02:44:19,SageSaga,use the history we have

05-06-2020T02:44:58,SageSaga,Yosh!'s lore is basically our world- but with a secret of an age of magic before the collapse from the Bronze Age

05-06-2020T02:46:05,SageSaga,back then there was a world wide civilization built on magic- but when magic was sealed away civilization crumbled and we have human history as we know it

05-06-2020T02:55:33,SageSaga,you could still have Hags in such a world- because hags magic is usually defined as being strange compared to normal magic-
05-06-2020T02:55:47,SageSaga,so a hag might have found a way to gain magic from uglyness
05-06-2020T02:55:58,unsteddyphoenix,"Dark, ugly magic"
05-06-2020T02:56:05,Kameloh,just call it ugly magic XD
05-06-2020T02:56:06,unsteddyphoenix,Forbidden by the holy church of beauty
05-06-2020T02:56:32,Dadrobit,"Looks daunting if you've never worked a mixer, but it's the closest quality thing I could find with built in fx that wasn't just a reverb and compressor."
05-06-2020T02:56:34,w0lfmare,Would alcohol be a magic potion?
05-06-2020T02:56:56,unsteddyphoenix,"No its poison, it sabotages your magic sensors"
05-06-2020T02:57:03,Dadrobit,"Also, half the price of the goxlr msrp"
05-06-2020T02:57:15,unsteddyphoenix,Basically feargas
05-06-2020T02:57:20,TLDragon,@mihari I bet you'd still look good despite that. :)
05-06-2020T02:57:26,Mihari,"Aww, well thank you. :3"
05-06-2020T02:58:10,SageSaga,yeah but you cant do presets- right? I would need to adjust it over and over?
05-06-2020T02:59:00,Dadrobit,"No buttons for things like samples, but the extra channels means you can do things like embed different ambient sounds and sounds and fade them in and out depending on the situation."
05-06-2020T02:59:18,Dadrobit,Songs and sounds*
05-06-2020T02:59:59,w0lfmare,Purp comics :eyes:
05-06-2020T03:00:02,SageSaga,im not sure if i can use multiple channels with discord
05-06-2020T03:00:21,Dadrobit,"This thing is 100% analog goodness. No software to be had. So yeah, you'd have to get used to manual adjustments."
05-06-2020T03:00:22,SageSaga,assuming i could set each channel to sound like a different thing and swap between them
05-06-2020T03:00:45,Dadrobit,It all mixes down.
05-06-2020T03:00:59,SageSaga,explain
05-06-2020T03:01:24,Dadrobit,The output is the same as your Focusrite more or less.
05-06-2020T03:01:43,Dadrobit,"Wait, lemme think about it"
05-06-2020T03:03:06,SageSaga,"the big thing the Go XLR gives me is i can modify the pitch, reverb etc to modify how my voice sounds- and save those settings to a button- so when i need to talk as a woman- i press the woman button, when im a demon- i can press the demon button!"
05-06-2020T03:03:21,SageSaga,and of course a normal button so it doesnt add anything
05-06-2020T03:04:57,DarthRexKing,going to bed. -o-
05-06-2020T03:05:07,SageSaga,the censor button is also good for me because i dont curse- i could use it to make it sound like the NPCs are cursing XD
05-06-2020T03:05:10,SageSaga,gnight Darth!
05-06-2020T03:05:14,w0lfmare,Night darth o/
05-06-2020T03:05:22,DarthRexKing,\o
05-06-2020T03:05:33,PurpleLemons,"off I think I need to try and get some sleep, still really hot here"
05-06-2020T03:05:51,SageSaga,i doubt they anticipated the Go XLR censor button would be used to make someone curse that wasnt but alas-
05-06-2020T03:05:59,SageSaga,take care Purple!
05-06-2020T03:06:03,SageSaga,thanks for joining me!
05-06-2020T03:06:08,PurpleLemons,just gonna show what I did today

05-06-2020T03:07:23,RheyareZeta,thanks for streaming lemons!
05-06-2020T03:07:39,w0lfmare,Good stuff purple. Productive day \o/
05-06-2020T03:07:46,Dadrobit,"Okay, yes, there is a sum to mono button on the mixer, so everything, like your voice channel, a town music channel, and a town chatter channel, can all be sent through as a single source to be sent to Discord."
05-06-2020T03:08:09,Dadrobit,"Thanks for joining, purp!"

05-06-2020T03:09:23,Maku,Thanks for streaming Purp!
05-06-2020T03:09:27,Maku,Nighto! :cmaku-EMOTE_Maku_001_F:
05-06-2020T03:10:44,Dadrobit,"As for the sound sample buttons, you might invest in a standalone sampler? If you were planning on $500, you'd have $200+ after the dedicated mixer. As for the voice modulation... That's the rub about the goxlr. It's kind of a unique thing."
05-06-2020T03:11:03,SageSaga,why ya keep calling it a sound sample?
05-06-2020T03:11:10,SageSaga,is that really a sound sample?
05-06-2020T03:11:30,Dadrobit,"The Yamaha from what I see can do some great modulation, but you'd need to just remember some setting to quickly adjust."
05-06-2020T03:12:10,Dadrobit,"Stuff like a *bleep* button? Yeah, that's a sample. The goxlr also lets you load other samples with the included software it runs on."
05-06-2020T03:12:38,SageSaga,thats the only thing i mentioned that was a sample thing though right?
05-06-2020T03:13:11,Dadrobit,"Yeah, but I imagine you could do a ton of cool stuff by loading other samples, like the sounds of combat."
05-06-2020T03:13:22,Dadrobit,Or a dra
05-06-2020T03:13:33,Dadrobit,Or a dragon/beast roars
05-06-2020T03:13:51,SageSaga,"im mostly looking for Modulation that can remember settings so i dont have to tweak things over and over, and XLR with phantom power input for my mic"
05-06-2020T03:14:11,SageSaga,i can do sounds like that via Roll20 no problem
05-06-2020T03:14:21,SageSaga,it has built in music and effects i can easily que up
05-06-2020T03:14:59,SageSaga,what i cant do is like- record NPC dialogue- i have to do that in real time
05-06-2020T03:15:44,Dadrobit,"I totally get the voice modulation presets being cool and legitimately useful. But man, that's a killer price to pay..."
05-06-2020T03:16:48,SageSaga,so the goXLR is pretty much the only option =_=
05-06-2020T03:17:22,Kameloh,I'm back!
05-06-2020T03:17:26,Kameloh,sorry I got pulled away
05-06-2020T03:17:41,w0lfmare,wb!
05-06-2020T03:17:45,SageSaga,wb
05-06-2020T03:17:53,Kameloh,thanks! but I should probably go 'cause it's late
05-06-2020T03:18:02,Kameloh,so thanks for having me! see you all later :D
05-06-2020T03:18:04,SageSaga,all alone again!

05-06-2020T03:18:31,SageSaga,byeeee
05-06-2020T03:18:31,Kameloh,:ckameloh-naokidemon50:*[gnight!]
05-06-2020T03:18:31,unsteddyphoenix,thanks for straaam kame
05-06-2020T03:18:58,w0lfmare,Night kame! thanks for streaming
05-06-2020T03:19:02,Maku,Night Kame!
05-06-2020T03:19:22,Kameloh,:ckameloh-bongocat_50:
05-06-2020T03:19:58,w0lfmare,"I think I'll head off for the night too, it's getting late. Keep up the good work Sage!"
05-06-2020T03:20:34,Dadrobit,o/ kame
05-06-2020T03:20:37,SageSaga,take care
05-06-2020T03:20:42,Dadrobit,o/ w0lf
05-06-2020T03:34:35,Dadrobit,"What kind of modulation are you looking for? I'm assuming primarily just pitch, formant, and/or delay/reverb?"
05-06-2020T03:35:41,SageSaga,"the XLR has Reverb, echo, pitch, and ""gender"""
05-06-2020T03:36:01,Dadrobit,Gender is almost certainly dormant
05-06-2020T03:36:07,Dadrobit,Formant*
05-06-2020T03:36:27,Dadrobit,Echo = delay
05-06-2020T03:36:30,SageSaga,im not familiar with the term formant so
05-06-2020T03:36:48,Dadrobit,"Pitch is the note, formant is the tonality."
05-06-2020T03:38:01,Dadrobit,So it's what makes one voice sound different from another even when they sing the same note.
05-06-2020T03:38:14,Dadrobit,Or speak for that matter
05-06-2020T03:38:44,SageSaga,im guessing i just have to wait for the GoXLR to come back out of hiding
05-06-2020T03:39:34,Dadrobit,The Roland VT-3 and VT-4 has some preset capabilities in those parameters.
05-06-2020T03:40:14,Dadrobit,But the output is 1/4 inch so you'd have to keep the Focusrite as your interface.
05-06-2020T03:40:55,Dadrobit,And it still would need some fader adjustment between presets...
05-06-2020T03:42:01,Dadrobit,"So yeah, if you're dead set on one touch modulation, I think you might be stuck waiting for a reasonable priced goxlr"
05-06-2020T03:43:21,SageSaga,to work for D&D i have to be able to switch quickly on the fly
05-06-2020T03:45:28,Dadrobit,I get that. I really really do. It looks like a super fun piece of gear. But man. The price physically hurts me...
05-06-2020T03:46:03,SageSaga,yeah
05-06-2020T03:46:44,SageSaga,but it would be really useful for me if it can help draw my players in more to the game
05-06-2020T03:47:56,Dadrobit,"Quick question, do you, or anyone here for that matter, use Audacity?"
05-06-2020T03:48:04,Dadrobit,Or Reaper?
05-06-2020T03:48:53,Dadrobit,Because the fx you're going after might be something that could be set up in a DAW for free and be endlessly flexible.
05-06-2020T03:49:27,Dadrobit,I think at least Reaper is capable of real time modulation.
05-06-2020T03:50:17,Dadrobit,Which means you can create channels with independent presets for the modulation you want and then just solo enable them when you want that effect.
05-06-2020T03:50:19,SageSaga,ive seen a lot of issues with digital voice changers
05-06-2020T03:50:35,Dadrobit,Reaper is the real deal.
05-06-2020T03:51:09,Dadrobit,"The goxlr is just a digital voice changer itself, just in an outboard box."
05-06-2020T03:52:27,SageSaga,yeah but its designed to work with its own drivers- a common issue with voice modulation software is it messes with things in between the driver and the hardware to alter the output
05-06-2020T03:53:04,SageSaga,and things that mess with things at that level are generally lagless- but also means they are working at a level that can cause serious issues
05-06-2020T03:53:27,SageSaga,its the same reason people hate anti-cheat software- that also functions the same way and can cause issues
05-06-2020T03:53:33,Dadrobit,Reaper is dedicated to being a proper digital audio workstation. It's more than just a piece of software that makes you sound silly.
05-06-2020T03:54:10,SageSaga,link it then and i can check it out
05-06-2020T03:54:12,Dadrobit,It does serious work and is a proper set of tools to do so.
05-06-2020T03:54:40,Dadrobit,https://www.reaper.fm/
05-06-2020T03:54:49,SageSaga,also - brb
05-06-2020T03:55:40,Dadrobit,"You know I use Pro Tools. The ""industry standard"" of DAWs. Reaper is legitimately bleeding Pro Tools dry of it's users because of how good it is."
05-06-2020T03:58:17,SageSaga,i'll check it out when i finish
05-06-2020T03:59:36,Dadrobit,I only have one concern. I BELIEVE it is capable of live modulation. But I am not 100% certain. Lemme dive into it myself when I get home and maybe I can mock up a demonstration.
05-06-2020T04:00:12,Dadrobit,I just don't want you blowing a ton of money on something that I could whip up for you for free ya know?
05-06-2020T04:00:25,SageSaga,i get ya
05-06-2020T04:10:06,SageSaga,im glad yall cant see this message popping up on the screen over and over
05-06-2020T04:17:23,Dadrobit,"Okay, I'm digging through a bit of stuff and I am 99.99% certain I can make this work."
05-06-2020T04:20:24,SageSaga,well im done!
05-06-2020T04:20:33,ZRO4825,Good stuff~
05-06-2020T04:20:34,Dadrobit,Right on man!
05-06-2020T04:25:16,SageSaga,would i also need to get Virtual Cable?
05-06-2020T04:25:49,Dadrobit,I'm not sure what that is?
05-06-2020T04:26:29,Dadrobit,"From my quick dive, it looks like you can direct the output from Reaper straight to Discord."
05-06-2020T04:26:30,SageSaga,its a Virtual audio cable program
05-06-2020T04:27:34,SpazztasticKiwi,3 hour movie at 2 am
05-06-2020T04:27:43,SpazztasticKiwi,perfectly reasonable
05-06-2020T04:27:45,Dadrobit,"I want you to be able to get the signal from the mic to the audience with as little software in-between as possible. Few moving parts, less points of failure."
05-06-2020T04:27:49,Dadrobit,And less lag.
05-06-2020T04:33:41,SageSaga,Reaper looks really complex
05-06-2020T04:33:56,SageSaga,makes sense considering what it is- but might be a pain for me to work with
05-06-2020T04:39:45,Dadrobit,"The end result will be however many voices you want as presets, will show up as named tracks. Then all you'll have to do is toggle the ""solo"" button to engage the preset."
05-06-2020T04:40:02,Dadrobit,You'll just ignore everything else.
05-06-2020T04:41:05,Dadrobit,"Effectively, one button preset functionality the same as the goxlr."
05-06-2020T04:43:08,Dadrobit,"If I can get it working easily myself, I can just save the session and send it to you so you don't need to even worry about the initial setup, you can just adjust and tweak the parameters to your own desire from there."
05-06-2020T04:43:33,SageSaga,sounds like its worth a try
05-06-2020T04:43:36,SageSaga,i appreciate it
05-06-2020T04:44:01,Dadrobit,No problem.
05-06-2020T04:44:31,Dadrobit,"It's worth mentioning, Reaper isn't TECHNICALLY free, but you can trial it for free forever."
05-06-2020T04:45:13,Dadrobit,"Just after 30 days or so, you'll have an initial pop up that last a few seconds before you can close it with a ""I'm still trialing"" button."
05-06-2020T04:45:28,Dadrobit,And you still have full functionality.
05-06-2020T04:45:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"after 15 years, you’re still “thinking about it”?"
05-06-2020T04:45:59,SpazztasticKiwi,“yes”
05-06-2020T04:46:08,Dadrobit,"Though the cost is only a one time $60, so it's not the worst bank breaker out there"
05-06-2020T04:47:06,SageSaga,if it works well i'll buy it
05-06-2020T04:48:46,Dadrobit,"Best case, it's 1/8th the cost you were expecting. Worst case... Well you were planning on the goxlr anyways up to this point."
05-06-2020T04:50:18,Dadrobit,"Regardless, I've been meaning to dive into Reaper myself for a while."
05-06-2020T04:50:27,Dadrobit,So it'll be good practice.
05-06-2020T04:51:36,Dadrobit,"Everyone around me in the sound field is making the switch from Pro Tools to Reaper and they're all ecstatic with the change, so it's about time I got a good look for myself."
05-06-2020T04:52:58,Dadrobit,Kinda like the art folks giving up PS and their subscription for stuff like CSP and other full featured programs.
05-06-2020T04:58:36,SpazztasticKiwi,anybody else feeling the 🛌
05-06-2020T04:59:09,Dadrobit,Only for the last 6 hours or so.
05-06-2020T05:00:54,SpazztasticKiwi,they won’t notice you taking a nap nap
05-06-2020T05:01:22,Dadrobit,They really won't. Because I am the one that looks for those going nap nap.
05-06-2020T05:01:37,Dadrobit,Who watches the watchers?
05-06-2020T05:01:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"anybody comes by, just raise your head back up with a “in Jesus’s name amen”"
05-06-2020T05:03:08,Dadrobit,"""On a Saturday morning?"" ""Yes sir. It part of my religion. I am a Northwestern Baptist Jewthiest"""
05-06-2020T05:04:18,SpazztasticKiwi,...there’s not really a religion that puts a quota on praying
05-06-2020T05:05:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve yet to hear of one that’s like “NO! you’ve already gotten in your allowed 5 a day”
05-06-2020T05:05:06,Dadrobit,"Please, don't discriminate, I don't want to have to get HR or the legal team involved."
05-06-2020T05:05:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"to be fair, that’s work pretty well"
05-06-2020T05:05:31,SpazztasticKiwi,thatd
05-06-2020T05:07:19,Dadrobit,"For real though, religious discrimination is something you don't screw around with, 'specially if you're a Mormon here in AZ. They WILL go after you."
05-06-2020T05:08:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I e never experienced mormons
05-06-2020T05:08:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve come across jahovahs witnesses
05-06-2020T05:08:48,SpazztasticKiwi,but that was in a walmart & I avoided them like a shoplifter with mall security
05-06-2020T05:09:15,Dadrobit,"Regular Mormons are alright, if a bit pushy. Jack Mormons can fuck right off."
05-06-2020T05:09:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a joke there but I cant
05-06-2020T05:10:10,Dadrobit,"Also, any Mormon that knocks on my door at 6:30am can also fuck right off."
05-06-2020T05:10:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I live out in “you must be lost” territory
05-06-2020T05:10:56,SpazztasticKiwi,no door to door nuts here
05-06-2020T05:11:18,SpazztasticKiwi,but wake me up on my day off and I’ll show you what the devil looks like
05-06-2020T05:11:24,Dadrobit,"My street has gotten progressively more ghetto over the years, so I get a lot less than I used to."
05-06-2020T05:13:03,Dadrobit,"There's a Temple right down the road, so they used to come regularly. But more and more houses have gone full tweaker shack over time, so it's not so inviting anymore..."
05-06-2020T05:15:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t have a problem with religious people
05-06-2020T05:15:40,SpazztasticKiwi,just pushy ones
05-06-2020T05:15:46,SpazztasticKiwi,and touchy ones
05-06-2020T05:16:24,Dadrobit,"One house at the opening to the street is a literal pile of rubble after it got demo's months ago, the other opening house is boarded up and is missing part of the roof covered in tarp, and the next one down is a trash heap with a derelict RV sitting"
05-06-2020T05:16:44,Dadrobit,Under a camoflage netting.
05-06-2020T05:16:59,SpazztasticKiwi,hand of the Lord on my shoulder is just fine but anybody else’s I’m libel to bite
05-06-2020T05:17:02,Dadrobit,Lots of pitbulls chained in front of several of the houses
05-06-2020T05:17:47,SpazztasticKiwi,& you live all alone
05-06-2020T05:18:00,Dadrobit,Kudos to any motherfucker willing to walk down my dead end road to get to my house in a button up and a tie.
05-06-2020T05:18:11,Dadrobit,I have my dog
05-06-2020T05:19:03,SpazztasticKiwi,in the sense of companionship he counts but socialization & security
05-06-2020T05:19:06,Dadrobit,And my sister and her kids live next door.
05-06-2020T05:19:11,SpazztasticKiwi,might be questionable
05-06-2020T05:19:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"so just rough, not crackheads running around on fire while wars rage across streets"
05-06-2020T05:20:21,Dadrobit,Crackheads 110% run around the street at all hours. Usually they're not on fire.
05-06-2020T05:21:48,Dadrobit,"In terms of security, Oreo was absolutely not discouraged from barking like mad at people nearing the house. And there's a shotgun easily accessible in both the bedroom and living room if he isn't enough..."
05-06-2020T05:22:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I need to get a something to have when I live alone
05-06-2020T05:22:58,SpazztasticKiwi,don’t want dogs
05-06-2020T05:23:37,Dadrobit,I do NOT drive to or from work in uniform either. The thought of my neighbors even considering that I'm a cop can fuck right off.
05-06-2020T05:27:04,SpazztasticKiwi,clark kent in the ol broomcloset
05-06-2020T05:27:36,Dadrobit,"I change in the kitchen, but yeah."
05-06-2020T05:28:04,SpazztasticKiwi,like...the work kitchen?
05-06-2020T05:28:23,Dadrobit,"Yeah, the guard house I'm in."
05-06-2020T05:28:39,SpazztasticKiwi,“hey man what’d you bring for lunch? My wife packed me a-“
05-06-2020T05:28:46,Dadrobit,It's legit a house on top of being a security center.
05-06-2020T05:29:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"pan to coworker in his boxers, uniform on table"
05-06-2020T05:29:31,SpazztasticKiwi,“I’ll come back later”
05-06-2020T05:29:37,Dadrobit,"Kitchen keeps me out of view of residents while I change, and keeps me available for passdown information from the guy/girl I relieve."
05-06-2020T05:31:01,Dadrobit,Pants are already on. Just need to change the top and do the utility belt swap.
05-06-2020T05:49:55,SpazztasticKiwi,🛌
05-06-2020T05:51:18,Dadrobit,Damnit. IHOP screwed up my door dash... Ordered strawberry vanilla stuffed french toast. Just got it and it's plain. Though the receipt says what I ordered...
05-06-2020T07:04:15,artsketchanddesing,damn ıt i missed the stream
05-06-2020T08:10:31,Dadrobit,Yeah... By about a full 12 hours my dude....

05-06-2020T11:45:57,RimaDraws,hi ord
05-06-2020T11:59:00,Ordithus,ello rima
05-06-2020T12:08:27,RimaDraws,ord i have a question
05-06-2020T12:09:02,Ordithus,shoot
05-06-2020T12:09:04,RimaDraws,if you could choose between flora being possessed by ephemeral aka neutral or just Ephemeral alone as a contest entry what would you pick?
05-06-2020T12:09:09,JojoGD,I was finally able to complete Ggb0y’s part in bloodbath
05-06-2020T12:09:23,RimaDraws,because I am making Ephemeral's mask for a contest on a TK server and I didn't know what to go with
05-06-2020T12:10:15,Ordithus,Is there one you prefer?  That you like more for whatever reason?
05-06-2020T12:11:04,RimaDraws,i want to try Flora being possessed by Ephemeral but I know it's going to be a challenge getting the paint and wig styled....but i also like plain Ephemeral so I am having a hard time deciding
05-06-2020T12:13:09,Ordithus,possessed Flora is a cool look! Plain Ephemeral is rather plain - basically just a floaty mask
05-06-2020T12:13:55,RimaDraws,yea true. i just needed an opinion. I just plan to go all out with this entry
05-06-2020T12:14:45,Ordithus,Mary was also possessed for a while
05-06-2020T12:14:59,RimaDraws,i don't care for mary
05-06-2020T12:15:53,Ordithus,hokay
05-06-2020T12:16:05,RimaDraws,i mean she would be easy too
05-06-2020T12:17:06,RimaDraws,all i would need for her are the wig and contacts
05-06-2020T12:18:22,RimaDraws,i'll give it some thought
05-06-2020T12:19:13,RimaDraws,maybe i can do both
05-06-2020T12:19:33,AspiringNoodle,Hi peoples :D
05-06-2020T12:19:38,RimaDraws,hi noodle
05-06-2020T12:19:48,AspiringNoodle,"Rima, remember when I said you were a quitter for ""almost"" crashing? XD"
05-06-2020T12:20:09,RimaDraws,yea well i have a reason for crashing so much lately. it's called my time of the month
05-06-2020T12:20:24,AspiringNoodle,I slept for 13 hours :3
05-06-2020T12:20:29,RimaDraws,i crashed last night too
05-06-2020T12:20:42,RimaDraws,probably for 12 hours
05-06-2020T12:20:49,AspiringNoodle,Woo!
05-06-2020T12:20:52,AspiringNoodle,That's the spirit!
05-06-2020T12:21:15,AspiringNoodle,Was gonna be bummed about missing most of last night's stream
05-06-2020T12:21:21,AspiringNoodle,"But then again, I just slept for half a day"
05-06-2020T12:21:34,RimaDraws,well i'm not so bummed. i just needed to rest. i wasn't feeling well
05-06-2020T12:23:10,RimaDraws,but if i did mary possessed would i need to do human mary?
05-06-2020T12:24:16,AspiringNoodle,Probably
05-06-2020T12:24:25,Ordithus,"That is how she appeared in comic, I think that was part of what made Mary agree in the first place"
05-06-2020T12:24:31,AspiringNoodle,"Iirc, she regained her humanity thanks to Ephemeral"
05-06-2020T12:24:50,RimaDraws,oh yea that would explain that one sketch
05-06-2020T12:24:55,Ordithus,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/4/
05-06-2020T12:24:56,RimaDraws,deal with the devil

05-06-2020T12:25:34,Ordithus,"no problemo, glad to bounce ideas off!"
05-06-2020T12:25:48,RimaDraws,i might give the flora one a try later
05-06-2020T12:27:57,AspiringNoodle,Ugh... yay for another shift of closing
05-06-2020T12:28:07,AspiringNoodle,GOtta brace myself for 3.5 hours from now
05-06-2020T12:33:00,AspiringNoodle,"Lol, the meme has finally hit Apex Legends"
05-06-2020T13:12:53,AspiringNoodle,"I stand corrected, they're actually doing something"

05-06-2020T15:26:26,SageSaga,most people do
05-06-2020T15:26:39,SageSaga,or rather dont care XD
05-06-2020T15:39:02,AspiringNoodle,"Well, tbf, the only reason I'm still here is because work (mismanagement) has me going in at 5"
05-06-2020T15:39:28,AspiringNoodle,Otherwise I'd either be A) at work for the past 2 hours or B) Off (rare) and watching
05-06-2020T15:44:43,SageSaga,server is going all over the place
05-06-2020T15:44:52,SageSaga,Picarto is dropping and recovering over and over

05-06-2020T16:14:12,SageSaga,he's happy because he got his Arcanum lab and a bunch of stuff to work with- its like a kid just got back from a toy store after getting a thousand dollar gift card XD
05-06-2020T16:15:20,Werewing,I am still happy for the smol strawberry-haired boy.

05-06-2020T16:42:16,BadFoMo,Any idea why it would do that?
05-06-2020T16:42:57,SageSaga,nope- it's pretty uncommon for that to happen - i do have a thing where the active area stops responding - but this is different
05-06-2020T16:46:33,SageSaga,all done!
05-06-2020T16:46:37,BadFoMo,Cool!
