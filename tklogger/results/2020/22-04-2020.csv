22-04-2020T00:59:02,AspiringNoodle,I just parried some fool 3 times in a row.  All predictions!
22-04-2020T00:59:13,AspiringNoodle,Dude must be wonder what the f just happened!!
22-04-2020T00:59:30,AspiringNoodle,I now have a taste for Dark Souls PvP
22-04-2020T00:59:32,AspiringNoodle,I like it @w@
22-04-2020T01:06:24,AspiringNoodle,Or not? lol
22-04-2020T01:06:32,AspiringNoodle,RIP
22-04-2020T01:35:55,AspiringNoodle,"I swear, once you start dabbling in Dark Souls PvP, it becomes SO unfair to those who don't"
22-04-2020T01:36:14,AspiringNoodle,I'm parrying poor fools because I'm in their face and they don't know that they need to make space
22-04-2020T01:36:28,AspiringNoodle,"So they swing out and I'm there to react or, in most cases, predict WHEN they'll swing"

22-04-2020T10:03:45,TerraTheWizard,o/
22-04-2020T10:04:00,CrimsonQuill,How are you Terra?
22-04-2020T10:04:51,TerraTheWizard,tired & achey
22-04-2020T10:04:57,CrimsonQuill,Ouch.
22-04-2020T10:04:59,TerraTheWizard,was in work 3am-11am
22-04-2020T10:05:03,CrimsonQuill,....
22-04-2020T10:05:07,CrimsonQuill,That's a long shift.
22-04-2020T10:05:20,TerraTheWizard,8 hours
22-04-2020T10:05:22,CrimsonQuill,Yep
22-04-2020T10:05:45,CrimsonQuill,"Are you in tomorrow as well, or do you have time for sleep?"
22-04-2020T10:05:54,TerraTheWizard,2 days off
22-04-2020T10:05:58,CrimsonQuill,Nice.
22-04-2020T10:06:44,CrimsonQuill,"I'm off today and tomorrow, but earlier today I went into workplace, because the Health Service Executive (HSE) was carrying out Covid-19 tests for staff."
22-04-2020T10:06:55,CrimsonQuill,So I got myself tested... just incase.
22-04-2020T10:07:01,CrimsonQuill,Now I'm doing project work.
22-04-2020T10:07:10,TerraTheWizard,have fun
22-04-2020T10:07:16,CrimsonQuill,....Thaaaat and trying to make sure I don't have a bad habit relapse.
22-04-2020T10:07:39,CrimsonQuill,While listening to a toaster chanting in High Gothic (Adeptus Mechanicus are weird.)
22-04-2020T10:08:02,CrimsonQuill,But I'm just going to lurk around for now...pop in every hour or so.

22-04-2020T12:10:09,CrimsonQuill,I like what was chosen for the speech bubbles
22-04-2020T12:11:17,CrimsonQuill,How are you doing CrRAR?
22-04-2020T12:12:21,CrRAR,pretty good.
22-04-2020T12:12:54,CrRAR,"Yeah, Raine has dat inner strength and fortitude."
22-04-2020T12:13:41,CrimsonQuill,Part of the reason why she's my favourite character.
22-04-2020T12:13:58,CrimsonQuill,I think one of the best quotes to describe her comes from the Discworld
22-04-2020T12:14:20,CrimsonQuill,"Pertaining to Magrat Garlick, a rather...withdrawn member of the Ramtops witches."
22-04-2020T12:15:09,CrimsonQuill,"'Magrat was a small, furry animal in the corner, [...] ...and the problem with small, furry animals in the corner is that, sometimes, it's a mongoose'"
22-04-2020T12:15:46,CrimsonQuill,"Or, as TV tropes (may I never go there again~) puts it, 'Beware the Nice ones'"
22-04-2020T12:24:29,CrRAR,yesss
22-04-2020T12:56:06,AspiringNoodle,Must give Raine all the hugs :ptv-whiny:

22-04-2020T13:39:21,AspiringNoodle,I am exploring the most toxic place in Dark Souls 2
22-04-2020T13:39:26,AspiringNoodle,"I'm amazed I'm not raging yet, lol"
22-04-2020T13:40:42,AspiringNoodle,And I mean that literally :|
22-04-2020T13:41:27,AspiringNoodle,"Low lighting, can barely see in the distance, poison spitting statues, jars filled with acid, some bugs that emit acid clouds, enemies dropping poison throwing knives"
22-04-2020T13:52:18,CrimsonQuill,Ouch.
22-04-2020T13:52:31,CrimsonQuill,I still haven't gone through DS3 that I bought yet...
22-04-2020T13:58:41,AspiringNoodle,Just learned I can destroy the poison spitters
22-04-2020T13:58:43,AspiringNoodle,yay!
22-04-2020T13:58:54,CrimsonQuill,:)
22-04-2020T13:59:04,AspiringNoodle,Have you played dark souls 1?
22-04-2020T13:59:08,CrimsonQuill,no
22-04-2020T13:59:13,CrimsonQuill,or 2
22-04-2020T13:59:16,AspiringNoodle,"Trust me, you will learn toxic"
22-04-2020T13:59:17,CrimsonQuill,just got 3
22-04-2020T13:59:22,AspiringNoodle,And they name is blowdart snipers]
22-04-2020T13:59:26,AspiringNoodle,thy*\
22-04-2020T13:59:26,CrimsonQuill,a while back
22-04-2020T13:59:30,CrimsonQuill,Blowdart snipers....
22-04-2020T13:59:35,CrimsonQuill,Do players place those?
22-04-2020T13:59:40,AspiringNoodle,Nope
22-04-2020T13:59:55,AspiringNoodle,They're a nonrespawning enemy that are found only in Blighttown
22-04-2020T14:00:00,CrimsonQuill,Ah
22-04-2020T14:00:14,AspiringNoodle,"Blighttown is the most toxic place in DS1, figuratively and metaphorically"
22-04-2020T14:00:27,AspiringNoodle,"The whole lore is that it's a town beneath anor londo, and it's where all the filth ends up"
22-04-2020T14:00:51,CrimsonQuill,Urgh...kinda like the Undercity in Judge Dredd tehen.
22-04-2020T14:01:19,AspiringNoodle,"All the citizens are diseased and filthy.  The environment is poisonous.  There are mosquitos that can poison you, big giants with huge clubs that can also poison you (if they don't smash your face in), and then the worst douches of all, the blowdarts..."
22-04-2020T14:01:31,CrimsonQuill,Blurgh...
22-04-2020T14:01:46,AspiringNoodle,Low light limited vision environment with enemies that can start sniping at you from out of sight
22-04-2020T14:02:05,AspiringNoodle,"The worst part is that they inflict toxic, a far more deadly version of poison that lasts longer and deals far more damage per tick"
22-04-2020T14:02:16,CrimsonQuill,Having Jackal Sniper flashbacks
22-04-2020T14:02:22,AspiringNoodle,Pretty much
22-04-2020T14:02:39,AspiringNoodle,"As a noob,you'll probably be dying and / or dark signing / homeward boning back to bonfires a lot"
22-04-2020T14:03:10,AspiringNoodle,Veteran players know to farm the plant things in the Darkmoon Garden (ideally with a covetous gold serpent ring) to gather purple moss and blooming purple moss
22-04-2020T14:03:21,CrimsonQuill,What do they do?
22-04-2020T14:03:33,AspiringNoodle,The purple one cures poison
22-04-2020T14:03:38,AspiringNoodle,The blooming one cures poison AND toxic
22-04-2020T14:03:49,CrimsonQuill,Very useful...
22-04-2020T14:04:04,AspiringNoodle,"So before you head down there, if it's your first time you want a healthy supply of them"
22-04-2020T14:04:12,AspiringNoodle,"Veteran players can either grab just a few, or none at all"
22-04-2020T14:04:15,CrimsonQuill,Aheh
22-04-2020T14:04:23,AspiringNoodle,"Also a pro tip, get the Spider Shield"
22-04-2020T14:04:25,CrimsonQuill,Still trying to swim through Subnautica
22-04-2020T14:04:30,CrimsonQuill,And get through Halo legendary
22-04-2020T14:04:39,CrimsonQuill,And Space Hulk Deathwing on No Mercy
22-04-2020T14:04:48,AspiringNoodle,"It's the starting item for bandits iirc, and you can find one in the sewers just before Blighttown"
22-04-2020T14:05:06,AspiringNoodle,It has a hidden effect where it can block poison attacks
22-04-2020T14:05:25,AspiringNoodle,"If you try to block the giant's club or the sniper's blowdarts with any other shield, you'll start buildup of poison / toxic"
22-04-2020T14:05:31,CrimsonQuill,"That#s handy, but I don't know how to play Dark Souls at all"
22-04-2020T14:05:47,AspiringNoodle,"Maybe if I hurry through DS2, we can play together, lol"
22-04-2020T14:05:53,CrimsonQuill,LOL
22-04-2020T14:05:55,CrimsonQuill,Well
22-04-2020T14:05:57,CrimsonQuill,Maybe
22-04-2020T14:05:59,AspiringNoodle,"I'm starting to learn to parry fools in PvP.  Poor, poor, predictable fools"
22-04-2020T14:06:03,CrimsonQuill,But on the horizon
22-04-2020T14:06:12,CrimsonQuill,I have a project Wednesday next
22-04-2020T14:06:19,AspiringNoodle,Best match had me parry 3 attacks in a row on a guy
22-04-2020T14:06:20,CrimsonQuill,And a repeat exam afterwards in May
22-04-2020T14:06:26,CrimsonQuill,PvP?
22-04-2020T14:06:31,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, PvP :D"
22-04-2020T14:06:36,CrimsonQuill,uh oh
22-04-2020T14:06:39,CrimsonQuill,UH OH
22-04-2020T14:06:48,AspiringNoodle,This is dark souls beeyotch
22-04-2020T14:06:54,AspiringNoodle,You don't have a choice!
22-04-2020T14:06:54,CrimsonQuill,Umm
22-04-2020T14:07:00,CrimsonQuill,Can I play Happy Souls please?
22-04-2020T14:07:04,AspiringNoodle,"And if you don't like it, play in offline, lmao"
22-04-2020T14:07:07,CrimsonQuill,XD
22-04-2020T14:07:19,AspiringNoodle,But just remember you can't get friendly player summons if you do c:
22-04-2020T14:07:38,CrimsonQuill,LOL
22-04-2020T14:07:39,CrimsonQuill,Well
22-04-2020T14:09:42,AspiringNoodle,Don't worry too much.  Dark Souls 3 has some pretty fair PvP
22-04-2020T14:09:49,CrimsonQuill,That's good
22-04-2020T14:10:02,CrimsonQuill,"At the moment, the three games I am allowing myself are:"
22-04-2020T14:10:03,CrimsonQuill,Halo
22-04-2020T14:10:06,CrimsonQuill,Subnautica
22-04-2020T14:10:10,AspiringNoodle,DS2 is probably the most friendly for hosts since they can heal and there aren't a bunch of broken PvP mechanics
22-04-2020T14:10:13,CrimsonQuill,Space Hulk: Deathwing
22-04-2020T14:10:29,CrimsonQuill,Maybe in the summer after my exam I can do some
22-04-2020T14:10:36,AspiringNoodle,"But it's not friendly for invaders who can only heal through miracles, AND they lost a lot of the broken PvP mechanics that gave them a chance in 1"
22-04-2020T14:10:51,AspiringNoodle,"But 3, EVERYONE can heal :D"
22-04-2020T14:10:58,CrimsonQuill,That is NIIICE
22-04-2020T14:11:09,CrimsonQuill,So can people literally team up to take down a boss?
22-04-2020T14:11:12,AspiringNoodle,Yes
22-04-2020T14:11:33,CrimsonQuill,That's good.
22-04-2020T14:11:36,AspiringNoodle,"In Dark Souls 1 and 2, you can only see summon signs if your ""Humanity"" is restored"
22-04-2020T14:11:43,CrimsonQuill,"Because so far, I haven't even taken out the first boss"
22-04-2020T14:11:43,AspiringNoodle,"And Dark Souls 3, it requires you to be Embered"
22-04-2020T14:11:46,SpazztasticKiwi,my town is firmly up the creek now
22-04-2020T14:11:49,AspiringNoodle,"Oh no, Gundyr?!?"
22-04-2020T14:11:57,AspiringNoodle,He's the tutorial boss :ptv-whiny:
22-04-2020T14:12:01,CrimsonQuill,Covid-19 or plain Incompetence?

22-04-2020T14:12:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"rather, I should say the store itself"
22-04-2020T14:12:44,SpazztasticKiwi,but I’m off for two days
22-04-2020T14:12:52,AspiringNoodle,"Uh, I'll be back in a bit, gonna see if I can zoom through a bit of the game, start helping you"
22-04-2020T14:13:17,CrimsonQuill,@AspiringNoodle It's fine
22-04-2020T14:13:24,CrimsonQuill,I need to work on my project anyhow
22-04-2020T14:13:32,SpazztasticKiwi,would it not be easier to join discord and do it that way
22-04-2020T14:13:37,CrimsonQuill,Meh
22-04-2020T14:13:43,CrimsonQuill,I generally follow a rule
22-04-2020T14:13:55,CrimsonQuill,To not use discord in regards to Twokinds
22-04-2020T14:14:03,CrimsonQuill,"Number one, I just prefer Picarto"
22-04-2020T14:14:18,CrimsonQuill,"Number 2, It's nice not to associate voices with the people herre"
22-04-2020T14:14:20,SpazztasticKiwi,for the game
22-04-2020T14:14:26,CrimsonQuill,Dunno
22-04-2020T14:14:34,SpazztasticKiwi,and discord has text too
22-04-2020T14:14:36,CrimsonQuill,"Just to be honest, I'm not thinking about it atm"
22-04-2020T14:15:20,SpazztasticKiwi,my sisters cat has taken a liking to my room suddenly
22-04-2020T14:15:38,CrimsonQuill,Which cat is this?
22-04-2020T14:15:41,CrimsonQuill,Bagheera?
22-04-2020T14:15:49,CrimsonQuill,Or is that your cat?

22-04-2020T14:16:20,SpazztasticKiwi,no guess why except that she’s blind and maybe thinks she’s in her room
22-04-2020T14:16:41,CrimsonQuill,Oh...that's actually a bit sad...poor cat.
22-04-2020T14:26:17,CrimsonQuill,Okay guys
22-04-2020T14:26:22,CrimsonQuill,I'm off for a bit
22-04-2020T14:26:28,CrimsonQuill,Might pop back before bef
22-04-2020T14:26:31,CrimsonQuill,Bed
22-04-2020T14:26:48,CrimsonQuill,But if I don't head off I'll keep lurking and not do any project work...
22-04-2020T14:26:52,CrimsonQuill,Cya 'round.
22-04-2020T14:26:55,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-victory:
22-04-2020T14:56:15,SpazztasticKiwi,the buenos aires governor brought his cat to an interview and he flashed the camera
22-04-2020T14:56:21,SpazztasticKiwi,they blurred it
22-04-2020T15:06:50,SpazztasticKiwi,you know that new walk in on your guy naked and film his reaction challenge
22-04-2020T15:07:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I thought of flora trying it but.....she doesn’t wear clothes
22-04-2020T15:07:57,SpazztasticKiwi,she just walks out to Trace and is all “notice anything different?”
22-04-2020T15:08:30,SpazztasticKiwi,and suddenly it’s the jeopardy theme as he sits there confused
22-04-2020T15:13:04,AspiringNoodle,Well I'm stupid
22-04-2020T15:13:35,AspiringNoodle,"Couldn't recognize torches when they were right in front of me, lol"
22-04-2020T15:13:45,AspiringNoodle,Now I'm slowly lighting every torch in the area and omg I can see!
22-04-2020T15:22:56,AspiringNoodle,"Oof, another 40k xp / moneys down the drain.  Oh well.  DARK SOULS! :ptv-excited:"

22-04-2020T15:48:43,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s not as action-y enough for me as doom but I did start watching doom first
22-04-2020T15:50:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Seán’s mostly going through hl looking around rather than going for finishing the game

22-04-2020T17:08:34,CrimsonQuill,It involves a couple who found a kitten by some bins
22-04-2020T17:08:40,CrimsonQuill,I don't know if I've linked it
22-04-2020T17:10:42,CrimsonQuill,@SpazztasticKiwi
22-04-2020T17:10:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t have my whispers on
22-04-2020T17:11:00,CrimsonQuill,Aaaah
22-04-2020T17:11:03,CrimsonQuill,Problematic...
22-04-2020T17:11:09,CrimsonQuill,Maybe...link just here?
22-04-2020T17:13:22,SpazztasticKiwi,is robit paying attention
22-04-2020T17:13:38,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s news they might be blocking stimulus checks from immigrant spouses
22-04-2020T17:14:02,SpazztasticKiwi,and maybe their families...or descendants..
22-04-2020T17:14:14,CrimsonQuill,Stimulus checks?
22-04-2020T17:15:08,SpazztasticKiwi,the money from the pandemic
22-04-2020T17:15:15,CrimsonQuill,...
22-04-2020T17:15:25,CrimsonQuill,That is diabolical.
22-04-2020T17:15:36,CrimsonQuill,"They're working and living in the country, aren't they?"
22-04-2020T17:15:50,CrimsonQuill,"They're out of work because of the pandemic, aren't they?"
22-04-2020T17:19:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"that’s the thing, there’s no telling if the article is fake or if there’s better details that change what they’re trying to give off"
22-04-2020T17:21:42,CrimsonQuill,....
22-04-2020T17:21:47,CrimsonQuill,confusion
22-04-2020T17:37:05,CrimsonQuill,"Okay, I'm off to bed."
22-04-2020T17:37:08,CrimsonQuill,Goodnight all.
22-04-2020T17:37:25,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-greetings::ptv-greetings::ptv-greetings::ptv-sleepy::ptv-sleepy::ptv-sleepy:
22-04-2020T17:44:34,SpazztasticKiwi,confusion is politics
22-04-2020T18:18:50,Dadrobit,I know I don't have mine.
22-04-2020T18:22:54,Dadrobit,"Haven't heard of them being withheld for immigration status, but it wouldn't surprise me considering they're trying to let banks and loan sharks intercept them to pay off pre-existing debts."
22-04-2020T18:27:06,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah there was something about madness for banks being allowed to hold and use checks for debts too
22-04-2020T18:27:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"honestly, that’s what most people I know have been doing"
22-04-2020T18:28:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"customers at work, I’ve seen buying tvs - and not regular tvs or something you could say is a reasonable goodie - the bigguns"
22-04-2020T18:28:36,SpazztasticKiwi,we ran out of and may still be out of most electronics rn
22-04-2020T18:30:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"the idea was free support money, whatever they decide to use it for is on them so if they get hit worse after playing I just won the lottery, dastoobad you did it to yourself"
22-04-2020T18:30:59,SpazztasticKiwi,but forcing it on debt pay? what if they’ve been using the left overs month to month to get food and need some decent groceries
22-04-2020T18:31:21,Dadrobit,yuuuuuup
22-04-2020T18:31:40,Dadrobit,And Arizona has me legitimately worried now.
22-04-2020T18:31:53,SpazztasticKiwi,mines staying in my savings for a jump towards a car
22-04-2020T18:32:02,Dadrobit,It's getting me legitimately scared.
22-04-2020T18:32:20,SpazztasticKiwi,the unfortunate thing on my part is I can’t go shopping for one anymore because ~everything’s closed~
22-04-2020T18:34:03,Dadrobit,Had an anti-lockdown protest at my capitol yesterday. They're openly threatening murder against people now.
22-04-2020T18:34:58,SpazztasticKiwi,jackasses are just fine sitting at home or doing nothing if not both together until you tell them too
22-04-2020T18:37:27,Dadrobit,"One of the speakers was a Vietnam vet who compared pro-lockdown people to ""socialist communists, I’m sorry we didn’t kill them all."""
22-04-2020T18:37:46,Dadrobit,"""I don’t want to have to shoot ‘em again. But I will if I have to!"""
22-04-2020T18:37:53,Dadrobit,And the crowd fucking cheered....
22-04-2020T18:38:21,SpazztasticKiwi,sounds about wite
22-04-2020T18:38:37,SpazztasticKiwi,tight
22-04-2020T18:38:41,SpazztasticKiwi,r I g h t
22-04-2020T18:39:46,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s plenty of unhabited islands
22-04-2020T18:40:24,Dadrobit,"He was largely targeting Democrats and their leaders, ""“We’re under attack by China. And the Democrats are on the Chinese side,"" and went on to say ""vote them out"" or else he'll murder them."
22-04-2020T18:40:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"if they want to be wild unhinged crackheads, those who don’t believe and don’t like the quarantine or way things are want to go and turn can go therw"
22-04-2020T18:41:01,Dadrobit,Like. I actually feel sick to my stomach about this bullshit...
22-04-2020T18:41:28,SpazztasticKiwi,if I hear China is evil one more time ~I~ might commit murder
22-04-2020T18:41:56,Dadrobit,That motherfucker needs to spend some time at Gitmo... POS terrorist.
22-04-2020T18:42:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I got a slap to the face the day someone at my old job told me Mark was getting deported once trump took office
22-04-2020T18:43:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark gave me a heart attack when I saw he had a Georgia show
22-04-2020T18:44:25,SpazztasticKiwi,the south is not always friendly
22-04-2020T18:44:57,SpazztasticKiwi,...what gitmo now
22-04-2020T18:45:02,SpazztasticKiwi,what’s
22-04-2020T18:45:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll spell right eventually
22-04-2020T18:46:19,Dadrobit,Guantanamo Bay.
22-04-2020T18:46:34,SpazztasticKiwi,that sorta rings a bell
22-04-2020T18:47:16,Dadrobit,"Notorious detention center, infamous for its unconstitutional hold on its prisoners and regular torture. Generally reserved for captured terrorists."
22-04-2020T18:47:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"all things considered tho, I have plenty of bells in my head rn too"
22-04-2020T18:48:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m convinced he could start marching off a hill and they’d follow
22-04-2020T18:48:54,Dadrobit,They'd ask to go first.
22-04-2020T18:52:48,SpazztasticKiwi,legit at work in the break room “all this is is a attack against trump”
22-04-2020T18:53:03,RimaDraws,heyo again for a bit
22-04-2020T18:54:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I found a toy under my bed that’s just a long fuzzy tube sock on a stick
22-04-2020T18:54:44,Dadrobit,o/ Rima
22-04-2020T18:54:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m considering cutting it off the stick and stuffing it with catnip because I bet it’s hollow
22-04-2020T18:55:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"and then, watch the madness when I throw it on the cats"
22-04-2020T18:56:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"I wrapped it around Bagheera earlier and if he had the hat and glasses, he’d be a hipster"
22-04-2020T18:58:42,RimaDraws,waiting to get into a call with my classmates right now
22-04-2020T18:58:44,RimaDraws,o/
22-04-2020T18:59:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I will admit I wonder how bad it really is down here because I have no experience on it
22-04-2020T19:00:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’ve seen and heard, but I’m still not the target for lack of better terms"
22-04-2020T19:00:49,Dadrobit,My class starts in a few hours.
22-04-2020T19:00:57,SpazztasticKiwi,skool
22-04-2020T19:01:02,SpazztasticKiwi,🏫
22-04-2020T19:01:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"other than work, I don’t have anything but housework"
22-04-2020T19:01:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I do have a plan to do major laundry and cleaning tomorrow per the news I got yesterday
22-04-2020T19:01:55,Dadrobit,"My professor is bomb, offers 3 class times a day. 8pm is always super low count. Last time it was literally just him and myself. Finished the coursework in and hour and then just spent the next two hours talking about black holes."
22-04-2020T19:02:28,SpazztasticKiwi,sounds..............absorbing
22-04-2020T19:03:11,SpazztasticKiwi,inescapable
22-04-2020T19:03:32,Dadrobit,Don't be... dense
22-04-2020T19:03:59,SpazztasticKiwi,what a massive stance
22-04-2020T19:04:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m sure it was immeasurable
22-04-2020T19:05:20,SpazztasticKiwi,oh before I forget again you know the Nora reni sketch
22-04-2020T19:05:37,Dadrobit,The human version one?
22-04-2020T19:05:46,SpazztasticKiwi,yea
22-04-2020T19:05:55,Dadrobit,What about it?
22-04-2020T19:05:57,SpazztasticKiwi,the angle her arm is and the whole scales from the elbow down thing made me think of cosplay
22-04-2020T19:06:14,SpazztasticKiwi,have we seen anything like Nora at a convention type thing
22-04-2020T19:06:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"cause I could see her human form, with her legs half dragon and arms half dragon with horns, as a sort of cosplay cause there’s plenty of that style of dragon girl"
22-04-2020T19:07:28,SpazztasticKiwi,but she’d be there as a legit dragon but all everyone’s remarking on is how amazing her costume is
22-04-2020T19:07:59,Dadrobit,Maybe I don't know what you're talking about. https://www.patreon.com/posts/humans-nora-and-36161012
22-04-2020T19:08:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"later, two guys are outside the building as it smolders under firefighters water jets in fire blankets like “it wasn’t a costume”"
22-04-2020T19:08:51,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s easier in colored versions
22-04-2020T19:10:39,Dadrobit,I see what you mean now
22-04-2020T19:11:02,SpazztasticKiwi,why is patreon being an ass
22-04-2020T19:11:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"“loading...................nah I got it, it’s just........loading”"
22-04-2020T19:13:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Nora like “calling my craft a costume....the blasphemy”
22-04-2020T19:13:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"but that’s also not Nora, just something I saw in how that form looks"
22-04-2020T19:20:51,Dadrobit,Seraphina would probably be a better option no?
22-04-2020T19:21:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a feeling most seraphina ideas get a who
22-04-2020T19:22:58,SpazztasticKiwi,what about Nibbly: Bath Time
22-04-2020T19:23:11,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s just a ball of suds with a tail
22-04-2020T19:23:41,SpazztasticKiwi,or eyes peering out
22-04-2020T19:23:58,SpazztasticKiwi,“is that a furby?”
22-04-2020T19:24:17,SpazztasticKiwi,pandemonium
22-04-2020T19:25:49,SpazztasticKiwi,what if Raine made Nibbly a mini Sythe plushie
22-04-2020T19:26:12,Dadrobit,"huh, Sera actually has ever won twice as a sketch."
22-04-2020T19:26:19,SpazztasticKiwi,exactly
22-04-2020T19:26:20,Dadrobit,But both times she made it as a color
22-04-2020T19:26:30,Dadrobit,Could be a missed market actually.
22-04-2020T19:26:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I almost asked who’s that again when you mentioned her
22-04-2020T19:27:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I like her ok but I have a bit of a heavier (unhealthy) obsession with Nibbly pieces
22-04-2020T19:28:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Kay shows Zan and Sythe yoga
22-04-2020T19:28:19,SpazztasticKiwi,kat
22-04-2020T19:28:41,SpazztasticKiwi,but Nibblys head blocks the camera
22-04-2020T19:31:26,Dadrobit,Sooooo just Nibbs head?
22-04-2020T19:32:42,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-power:
22-04-2020T19:33:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"no, like in the frame half blocking Sythe and Zen doing downward dog"
22-04-2020T19:33:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Kat is fully visible
22-04-2020T19:33:28,Dadrobit,"Dunno what to do for my next request tbh. Was discussing one w/ unsteddy a few weeks back that he seemed to like, but I think Tom would turn down lol."
22-04-2020T19:33:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"all the whole, they’re whining the name of the move is rude"
22-04-2020T19:34:05,SpazztasticKiwi,w h i l e
22-04-2020T19:34:17,SpazztasticKiwi,why can I not get keyboard to cooperate
22-04-2020T19:35:00,SpazztasticKiwi,we haven’t seen a wholesome lot of Reni
22-04-2020T19:35:24,SpazztasticKiwi,how about something like Reni tries coffee or attempts cooking as a human
22-04-2020T19:37:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I emptied out a box and put it on the floor and a cat has materialized in it
22-04-2020T19:37:50,Dadrobit,"Bah, my internet is bullshit, picarto keeps disconnecting."
22-04-2020T19:39:53,Dadrobit,TFW your shitty phone internet is more stable than your GIGABLAST SUPREME package home connection.
22-04-2020T19:42:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom our of pure curiosity how long have you been paying attention
22-04-2020T19:43:30,Dadrobit,"Dunno, I'm kinda digging Serapina getting transported to irl and accidentally being put in a cosplay contest. Winning, she finally gets the revered attention she ""deserves""."
22-04-2020T19:46:45,SpazztasticKiwi,where she promptly burns down the stage showing off
22-04-2020T19:47:28,CrRAR,:fire::open_mouth::open_mouth::ctwokinds-KeithNeat::open_mouth::open_mouth::fire:
22-04-2020T19:57:55,SpazztasticKiwi,apparently barely any attention
22-04-2020T19:59:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I went outside and something hissed at me
22-04-2020T20:04:07,CrRAR,"ahh, the great outdoors"
22-04-2020T20:04:26,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:*[AHHHH]
22-04-2020T20:07:46,CrRAR,No sign of what it was?
22-04-2020T20:08:02,CrRAR,Do possums hiss?
22-04-2020T20:08:25,CrRAR,Maybe it was just a really inaccurate skunk.
22-04-2020T20:08:45,CrRAR,Failed out of skunk school
22-04-2020T20:09:28,SpazztasticKiwi,we don’t really have skunks here
22-04-2020T20:10:19,SpazztasticKiwi,you’ll see possums armadillos raccoons..
22-04-2020T20:10:27,SpazztasticKiwi,deer too at night and bunnies
22-04-2020T20:10:43,SpazztasticKiwi,but I swear there’s more squirrels than any of them ever
22-04-2020T20:12:52,CrRAR,The other critters should lean to climb trees
22-04-2020T20:12:57,CrRAR,*learn
22-04-2020T20:13:11,CrRAR,Clearly the advantage here
22-04-2020T20:13:37,CrRAR,Might have been Bunnnicula doing the hissing
22-04-2020T20:13:46,CrRAR,sounds the most logical
22-04-2020T20:20:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m liking the Zen and Sythe do yoga idea
22-04-2020T20:21:41,SpazztasticKiwi,it reminds me of those few videos you see when some woman is filming herself and her cat shoves it’s entire self in front
22-04-2020T20:21:53,SpazztasticKiwi,blocking if not knocking over the camera
22-04-2020T20:22:23,CrRAR,Kitty obviously is always the main attraction
22-04-2020T20:22:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I can see Nibbly doing that over sythe
22-04-2020T20:22:45,SpazztasticKiwi,why did we not auto capitalize sythe there
22-04-2020T20:23:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Nibbly in full ❗️ mode
22-04-2020T20:25:59,RimaDraws,ugh that class meeting was so boring i dozed off during it then again i didn't  get much sleep
22-04-2020T20:26:20,CrRAR,Damn
22-04-2020T20:26:31,SpazztasticKiwi,oh and you know it started with captain america but I’ve been watching movies
22-04-2020T20:26:55,CrRAR,Taking our precious waking minutes and now stealing our sleep
22-04-2020T20:27:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"you know in iron man 2, when they’re all in that park area in the water..."
22-04-2020T20:27:18,SpazztasticKiwi,all 3 in metal suits...
22-04-2020T20:27:28,CrRAR,Is that the one with Mickey Rourk?
22-04-2020T20:27:30,SpazztasticKiwi,and the one guy has electric whip toys..
22-04-2020T20:27:43,CrRAR,yeah whip villan guy
22-04-2020T20:27:52,CrRAR,I didn't like that one
22-04-2020T20:27:56,SpazztasticKiwi,anyone wanna tell me how they’re not all just mega electrocuted
22-04-2020T20:28:06,RimaDraws,i have no idea what's being said
22-04-2020T20:28:51,CrRAR,Maybe Iron Man suit has an electrical isolation layer
22-04-2020T20:29:19,CrRAR,Like a soft cushy insulator interior
22-04-2020T20:29:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"and don’t give me any “they’re iron man suits, they don’t get electrocuted”, cause metal is metal and when you put those in water and add electricity, zap zap"
