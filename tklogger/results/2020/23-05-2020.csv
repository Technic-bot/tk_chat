23-05-2020T00:15:15,JojoGD,3rd encounter let‚Äôs go
23-05-2020T00:16:50,JojoGD,My charm Andre is ded
23-05-2020T00:22:32,JojoGD,My plan backfired but I was able to get back on track
23-05-2020T00:31:28,AspiringNoodle,I wonder if Quill got past Gundyr yet...
23-05-2020T00:33:49,AspiringNoodle,"Also, wish me luck, installing both Heroes of the Storm AND LoL"
23-05-2020T00:33:53,AspiringNoodle,I wanna try the kitty :D
23-05-2020T00:34:33,AspiringNoodle,"I played HotS for years, I know I love that game, it's just a matter of the state of the population"
23-05-2020T00:34:51,AspiringNoodle,LoL is just another monster entirely...
23-05-2020T00:55:55,JojoGD,I have to start over :ptv-sad:
23-05-2020T00:58:21,AspiringNoodle,I wanna play Yuumi :ptv-whiny:
23-05-2020T00:58:31,AspiringNoodle,https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/champion/yuumi/
23-05-2020T01:11:22,Dadrobit,"Unless you enjoy grand maelstroms of shit being throw your way from both the enemy team and your own, then no, you do not want to play yuumi."
23-05-2020T01:12:25,AspiringNoodle,Shouldn't I expect that anyways for being a new player? :ptv-snicker:
23-05-2020T01:13:19,Dadrobit,New players get leeway. New players on Yuumi get griefed.
23-05-2020T01:16:32,JojoGD,My luck ran out
23-05-2020T01:16:37,Dadrobit,Also she's I think literally the absolute worst character to learn how to play LoL with. Her gameplay is so far removed from every other champion in the game that it's like a completely different game.
23-05-2020T01:17:23,AspiringNoodle,Anivia then
23-05-2020T01:17:26,Dadrobit,"Nothing that you ""learn"" from playing her transfers to any other champion or how to play."
23-05-2020T01:17:28,AspiringNoodle,I like pretty ice birb c:
23-05-2020T01:18:43,Dadrobit,That'd be a decent one to learn. She's a different position from support (mostly) and her defensiveness can help newbies live long enough to learn something here and there.
23-05-2020T01:19:32,Dadrobit,"I don't think she's available as an immediate free champ, so you'd have to play a bit on others to save up, but I don't think she's expensive."
23-05-2020T01:23:28,AspiringNoodle,"Huh, looks like most of the champions I am interested in fall into the mage / marksman territory"
23-05-2020T01:23:41,AspiringNoodle,Maybe one day I will get to play cute kitty and Book :ptv-whiny:
23-05-2020T01:25:39,AspiringNoodle,"...dammit Riot, I'm watching the origin of Annie"
23-05-2020T01:25:56,JojoGD,I‚Äôm about to give up
23-05-2020T01:26:41,JojoGD,Finally after 45 min an encounter :ptv-whiny:
23-05-2020T01:29:35,AspiringNoodle,"This video is gonna make me cry, I know it."
23-05-2020T01:31:10,AspiringNoodle,Nailed it Q_Q
23-05-2020T01:31:43,JojoGD,I  want a lv 4 rattata
23-05-2020T01:39:06,JojoGD,I could have saved myself an hour if I saved after doing the glitch
23-05-2020T01:40:04,JojoGD,May the rampage begin
23-05-2020T01:44:37,JojoGD,I just destroyed brocks team with tackles
23-05-2020T01:45:43,AspiringNoodle,*sigh* Maybe I'd be better off avoiding LoL and sticking with HotS...
23-05-2020T01:45:51,AspiringNoodle,I've heard LoL can be notoriously toxic :/
23-05-2020T01:46:09,AspiringNoodle,Even if I really wanna play the book kitty :ptv-whiny:
23-05-2020T01:46:33,JojoGD,I forgot how fun Pok√©mon rby are
23-05-2020T01:54:42,JojoGD,Mt moon is still annoying as ever
23-05-2020T01:59:22,JojoGD,Misty destroyed
23-05-2020T02:04:54,JojoGD,:ptv-sleepy:
23-05-2020T02:07:08,AspiringNoodle,"Ugh, I am such a weeb"
23-05-2020T02:07:16,AspiringNoodle,"I chose the Kitsune as my first legend, lol"

23-05-2020T13:06:23,AspiringNoodle,sup peeps?
23-05-2020T13:07:01,AspiringNoodle,So far League of Legends is... okay.  The game is super slow paced for my tastes (especially after playing HotS for years)
23-05-2020T13:07:14,AspiringNoodle,"But there's a bit more depth to the game, and you aren't punished as harshly for dying :D"

23-05-2020T14:58:54,ThingsAreMoving,HotS had lots of problems last time I played it. Matchmaking took aaaaages
23-05-2020T14:58:54,AspiringNoodle,Especially downstairs :ptv-laugh:
23-05-2020T14:59:09,Brocade,Yessssss actually
23-05-2020T14:59:09,AspiringNoodle,Part of that is Blizzard's fault
23-05-2020T14:59:27,AspiringNoodle,They just suddenly cut all esports support and stripped part of the dev team
23-05-2020T14:59:30,ThingsAreMoving,But I admit it was more fun to play than lol
23-05-2020T14:59:32,Brocade,Is anyone in the TK cast canonically bi or gay?
23-05-2020T14:59:38,AspiringNoodle,So ofc a bunch of people up and left as a result

23-05-2020T21:41:38,RimaDraws,i am fast
23-05-2020T21:41:58,SpazztasticKiwi,are you sure you‚Äôre ok with everything else you got tho

23-05-2020T22:07:07,johnnytho,:(
23-05-2020T22:08:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"most will dart out of the lane but this one didn‚Äôt seem to have that idea, like it was slow or unafraid"
23-05-2020T22:09:15,SpazztasticKiwi,didn‚Äôt follow the other squirrels either
23-05-2020T22:11:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôd say it was young and for lack of better wording, a lil stupid because it wasn‚Äôt aggressive & other squirrels didn‚Äôt avoid it but"
23-05-2020T22:11:58,SpazztasticKiwi,it could‚Äôve had the beginnings of rabies too
23-05-2020T22:12:41,johnnytho,Rapid animals are the closest things we'll ever see to zombies.
23-05-2020T22:12:51,johnnytho,rabid*
23-05-2020T22:13:55,AspiringNoodle,"Rabies is the closest you'll get to zombies period, lol"
23-05-2020T22:14:05,RimaDraws,say what
23-05-2020T22:14:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom have you seen that pipsqueak baby squirrel again
23-05-2020T22:14:21,AspiringNoodle,Let's compare rabies vs zombies
23-05-2020T22:14:28,AspiringNoodle,Lack of self-preservation: Check
23-05-2020T22:14:38,AspiringNoodle,Heightened aggression: Check
23-05-2020T22:14:46,AspiringNoodle,Likes to bite: Check
23-05-2020T22:14:59,AspiringNoodle,Spreads through bites: Check
23-05-2020T22:15:02,SpazztasticKiwi,rabies also results in fear of liquids
23-05-2020T22:15:08,SpazztasticKiwi,which includes blood
23-05-2020T22:15:36,AspiringNoodle,"Therefore, zombieism is super rabies"
23-05-2020T22:59:31,Dadrobit,"Just looked through the rults, only one vote. This is a weird cycle."
23-05-2020T22:59:37,Dadrobit,results*
23-05-2020T23:00:27,Dadrobit,"Swinging between 4th place, to zero votes, to 5th place, to one vote."
23-05-2020T23:03:21,RimaDraws,i guess so
23-05-2020T23:06:54,Dadrobit,"Weird for me, usually I just sit at one or two votes every time until Tom saves me."
23-05-2020T23:06:54,RimaDraws,well i got that one pp done for next sunday. now to prepare for next month which will be a piece of cake
23-05-2020T23:07:06,RimaDraws,i haven't done suggestions in months
23-05-2020T23:08:26,Dadrobit,Paid Postage?
23-05-2020T23:08:31,RimaDraws,do what
23-05-2020T23:08:34,RimaDraws,no powerpoints
23-05-2020T23:08:37,Dadrobit,ohhh
23-05-2020T23:09:20,Dadrobit,Haven't used powerpoint in years. Weird nostalgia just thinking about it.
23-05-2020T23:09:33,RimaDraws,i use it all the time for school
23-05-2020T23:10:26,Dadrobit,Helped pops with his recording audio for his online classes and he uses exclusively powerpoint to make the videos entirely.
23-05-2020T23:10:42,Dadrobit,"It's painful to watch, but he makes it work."
23-05-2020T23:11:29,Dadrobit,with recording his audio*
23-05-2020T23:12:09,Ordithus,powerpoint... it's great for its one purpose
23-05-2020T23:12:14,Ordithus,see it used for way too much
23-05-2020T23:13:31,Dadrobit,"It's like watching an artist use MS Paint to do their digital art. Slow, Painful, but fuck me eventually they make something that looks good in the end."
23-05-2020T23:14:24,AspiringNoodle,MS Paint: The only option for the masochist artist <3
23-05-2020T23:16:06,WINDOWS98SE,"When I was at college, one of the few time we had to make a presentation, we used prezi."
23-05-2020T23:17:36,RimaDraws,i use it almost every course for presentations
23-05-2020T23:18:46,WINDOWS98SE,"Prezi?  Yeah, what I've seen of it is good.  Personally I've never used it, just gave others in my team the info and they made it."
23-05-2020T23:19:13,RimaDraws,i do not use prezi
23-05-2020T23:19:19,RimaDraws,i just use microsoft powerpoint
23-05-2020T23:19:34,WINDOWS98SE,"Ahh, sorry."
23-05-2020T23:20:42,RimaDraws,its fine
23-05-2020T23:20:53,WINDOWS98SE,Don't think I've used Power Point seriously since like 2012.
23-05-2020T23:35:07,Twokinds,"The last time I used powerpoint was in college, 2009, windows software class. haha"
23-05-2020T23:38:26,AspiringNoodle,When was the last time you played League of Legends? :P
23-05-2020T23:45:54,WINDOWS98SE,"@Twokinds Did they teach you programming or just how to use the software?  I read you were studying to be a radiographer, correct?"
23-05-2020T23:51:01,SpazztasticKiwi,what happened the past hour
23-05-2020T23:51:17,SpazztasticKiwi,it was quiet for awhile there
23-05-2020T23:52:10,SpazztasticKiwi,don‚Äôt you use excel for the submissions Tom
23-05-2020T23:53:59,WINDOWS98SE,Excel is quite different from Power Point though.
23-05-2020T23:54:14,WINDOWS98SE,Probably the most extensive out of the bunch is Access.
23-05-2020T23:54:42,Ordithus,I have seen much wizardry in excel
23-05-2020T23:54:49,WINDOWS98SE,I remember having to actually program actual scripts in VBA for it.
23-05-2020T23:56:17,SpazztasticKiwi,excel is the most complex of them all
23-05-2020T23:56:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"you can teach it formulas, charts, the power of world peace"
23-05-2020T23:57:23,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs been good for organizing my vocabulary
23-05-2020T23:57:47,Twokinds,It was a very basic class
23-05-2020T23:58:02,Twokinds,"Word processing, excel, etc"
23-05-2020T23:58:09,Twokinds,Although I still use Excel all the time
23-05-2020T23:58:17,Twokinds,So it was a little useful
23-05-2020T23:58:45,WINDOWS98SE,"I see, yeah Excel's useful in all sorts of situations."
23-05-2020T23:59:53,Twokinds,I use it to organize the data from the polls
