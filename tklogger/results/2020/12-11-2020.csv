12-11-2020T00:02:54,SpazztasticKiwi,with the unus annus sleepover I wonder if Mark would consider a sleepover with fans
12-11-2020T00:03:21,SpazztasticKiwi,you’d have to be 18 or more & itd have to be a big building but
12-11-2020T00:03:40,SpazztasticKiwi,other than that and it’s a gathering of a bunch of strangers what could possibly go wrong
12-11-2020T00:19:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark is pure chaotic chaos
12-11-2020T00:26:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m thinking of a word
