29-12-2020T19:07:57,AspiringNoodle,Next two weeks are gonna be a whole bunch of *sigh*
29-12-2020T19:08:35,AspiringNoodle,Majority of my shifts are the exact one that pushed me to find another job in the first place
29-12-2020T19:08:46,AspiringNoodle,At least the final one will be chill

29-12-2020T21:49:00,CrRAR,"that's quite the mood, ord"
29-12-2020T21:55:32,CrRAR,I think my new favorite snacking fruit are blackberries
29-12-2020T21:55:44,CrRAR,"not too sweet, just the right size"
29-12-2020T21:56:38,CrRAR,"Maybe I’ve just never had good ones, but the recent pickinggs seem :ok_hand:"

29-12-2020T23:01:12,SpazztasticKiwi,ok
29-12-2020T23:01:14,SpazztasticKiwi,soooooo
29-12-2020T23:01:48,CrRAR,have things become more chill?
29-12-2020T23:01:52,SpazztasticKiwi,the hot case was fine but everything in the coolers and freezers had to be tossed & replaced in the whole store including the meat/cheese case
29-12-2020T23:02:38,CrRAR,Ok so you could say
29-12-2020T23:02:42,CrRAR,:cw0lfmare-Paperembercool:
29-12-2020T23:02:46,CrRAR,no chill at all then
29-12-2020T23:03:04,SpazztasticKiwi,supervisor came by 30 minutes after I’ve clocked in & says shut down since we can’t use anything and I got all the dishes geared to go and was close to cleaning the fryer & rotisserie & it’s spool
29-12-2020T23:03:14,CrRAR,"Ah well, corporate writeoffs"
29-12-2020T23:03:51,CrRAR,So early day or just different assignment?
29-12-2020T23:04:24,SpazztasticKiwi,but the guy seems the hot case ok - other person with me ends up going to the store manager who of course didn’t say to shut down & will and has never or ever
29-12-2020T23:04:27,SpazztasticKiwi,said so
29-12-2020T23:04:37,SpazztasticKiwi,so we have to restart everything
29-12-2020T23:04:51,CrRAR,ah dang
29-12-2020T23:05:01,CrRAR,“Nothing. stops.”
29-12-2020T23:05:06,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-clovischuckle:
29-12-2020T23:05:15,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s no closer because who was supposed to be was in fact scheduled wrong - he no longer works in our department
29-12-2020T23:05:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"I brought this up a week ago because I was set 1-9, he 1-10, last person was set to leave at 6"
29-12-2020T23:06:16,SpazztasticKiwi,either call another person in or reconfigure the schedule
29-12-2020T23:06:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"never happened, ergo we have today"
29-12-2020T23:07:07,CrRAR,wow
29-12-2020T23:07:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"not only did all the cleaning if done be for nothing, I also had to stop mid stocking like the supervisor had told me to do while the other person (due to leave at 6) did all the closing while she was at lunch"
29-12-2020T23:07:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d done
29-12-2020T23:07:44,SpazztasticKiwi,because we were told to start back up
29-12-2020T23:08:29,SpazztasticKiwi,^ok person leaving at 6 was to do the closing while I stocked when she got back from her lunch
29-12-2020T23:09:00,CrRAR,Is part of the problem holiday schedules? Is there more people usually or will that be a recurring thing?
29-12-2020T23:09:13,SpazztasticKiwi,manager came in - when I was told she’d be here at 3 (she was not)
29-12-2020T23:09:35,CrRAR,Offff course not haha
29-12-2020T23:09:36,SpazztasticKiwi,so she helped close but in the end I closed
29-12-2020T23:09:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I just got home
29-12-2020T23:09:45,SpazztasticKiwi,they had to call her in
29-12-2020T23:09:56,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-GoogleyEmber:
29-12-2020T23:10:02,CrRAR,What a drag
29-12-2020T23:10:04,Ordithus,chaos
29-12-2020T23:10:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I was told she’d be there at 3 - whether that was the case & she was due then and just couldn’t get out of her dr appointment as fast as she - and we - would like is beyond me
29-12-2020T23:11:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"also, of course they came in and asked if I’d take the empty shift tomorrow because they have a new person scheduled to close & she doesn’t know how"
29-12-2020T23:11:32,CrRAR,g r e a t
29-12-2020T23:11:47,SpazztasticKiwi,& they’d rather me show her the ropes
29-12-2020T23:12:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m about to demand some manager-level pay or something
29-12-2020T23:12:31,CrRAR,yeah I’m shocked with all those major unforeseen failures a manager should have been around
29-12-2020T23:12:43,CrRAR,like called in
29-12-2020T23:13:04,CrRAR,holiday perfect storm
29-12-2020T23:13:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"they have me do counts for raw chickens, maintain SPARK, and effectively babysit"
29-12-2020T23:13:50,CrRAR,Should get a thank you or a bonus or something
29-12-2020T23:13:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"I shit you not I had 3 customers hone in on me to ask questions and if the department manager isn’t in the area, I’m the one asked any questions should another worker be lost"
29-12-2020T23:15:37,CrRAR,yeah holidays at work in my experience so far are either suspiciously quiet or a complete unpredictable disaster
29-12-2020T23:15:44,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s like I have “encyclopedia” written on me somewhere
29-12-2020T23:15:52,SpazztasticKiwi,or “instruction booklet”
29-12-2020T23:16:15,CrRAR,This year even on my end is more toward the disater end of the spectrum
29-12-2020T23:16:24,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s the kind of times when hearing your name gives you ptsd
29-12-2020T23:17:16,CrRAR,yep
29-12-2020T23:18:19,CrRAR,"At least being a reliable and dedicated worker are good, recognizable traits."
29-12-2020T23:18:33,CrRAR,but at some point too much is too much
29-12-2020T23:18:39,SpazztasticKiwi,“do you work here?”
29-12-2020T23:18:53,SpazztasticKiwi,no I walked in and started stocking bread for the hell of it
29-12-2020T23:19:17,CrRAR,haha
29-12-2020T23:22:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"today, with a billion other things to do, I had a guy ask what each thing was in the case"
29-12-2020T23:23:14,SpazztasticKiwi,despite the signs labeling what’s in the pans
29-12-2020T23:23:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I gave up halfway and just pointed out what was what individually
29-12-2020T23:24:42,CrRAR,Was he looking for like commentary or recommendations?
29-12-2020T23:25:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"evidently, he couldn’t read"
29-12-2020T23:25:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t know - he usually gets hot wings but we’re out
29-12-2020T23:25:36,SpazztasticKiwi,so he had to get a summary of what else was there I guess
29-12-2020T23:25:53,CrRAR,“None of those things sound like ‘hot wings’”
29-12-2020T23:25:56,CrRAR,“I know”
29-12-2020T23:26:08,CrRAR,“...do you have any more hot wings yet?”
29-12-2020T23:26:14,CrRAR,“no”
29-12-2020T23:26:24,CrRAR,“When will they be ready?”
29-12-2020T23:26:28,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-power: never
29-12-2020T23:26:33,CrRAR,:ptv-confused: okay
29-12-2020T23:26:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t mind spending time to help customers or people in general but it’s just I literally don’t have the time
29-12-2020T23:27:21,SpazztasticKiwi,especially during the heat of the holidays or busy hours and we have like
29-12-2020T23:27:23,SpazztasticKiwi,2 people
29-12-2020T23:28:31,CrRAR,Let alone without all the extra complications
29-12-2020T23:29:48,CrRAR,Just offer pesky customers a piece of cheese
29-12-2020T23:30:08,CrRAR,that usually occupies most ppl for a fair bit
29-12-2020T23:31:18,SpazztasticKiwi,guy wanted an 8 piece which the other person I was with was about to cook & the last seconds before it’s done he’s swung back by & is trying to talk to me
29-12-2020T23:32:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"he apparently thought he was rushing me but it like no dude, I just have chickens to take off the rotisserie, a lady is wanting two of them so there’s that to consider, and there’s your order"
29-12-2020T23:32:28,CrRAR,"does he want burnt food, cuz yeah that’s how he’ll get burnt food"
29-12-2020T23:32:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"which, I can’t leave hot or cold food out sitting for longer than 20 minutes, regardless of what else I have to do"
29-12-2020T23:33:12,CrRAR,"I experience that at work too, I swear sometimes people don’t realize that it isn’t YOU that has to do the work that they just asked for"
29-12-2020T23:33:48,SpazztasticKiwi,“I know you’re busy but”
29-12-2020T23:34:05,SpazztasticKiwi,that starter makes my eye twitch
29-12-2020T23:34:38,SpazztasticKiwi,especially when it’s can you make me a tray or bucket or order of some sort
29-12-2020T23:34:56,SpazztasticKiwi,don’t get mad if I say it’ll be a wait
29-12-2020T23:35:28,CrRAR,Yeah it’s like they think you push like a button just to accomplish everything they could possibly ask for
29-12-2020T23:37:33,SpazztasticKiwi,good thing about masks is the demand for smiles is pretty much dead
29-12-2020T23:38:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’m engaging as I can be with all I have to do and so on, so forth"
29-12-2020T23:39:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not always smiles and unicorns prancing through sunflower meadows with a rainbow in the background
29-12-2020T23:39:20,CrRAR,yeah you would think people would want to linger around as little as possible
29-12-2020T23:39:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"sometimes I’m strictly jumping from customer to customer, task to task, customer to task, etc"
29-12-2020T23:40:09,CrRAR,"Not when you have cakes, deli service and like hot foods to worry about"
29-12-2020T23:40:24,CrRAR,That’s like a full service restaurant menu
29-12-2020T23:40:44,SpazztasticKiwi,“smile sweetheart”
29-12-2020T23:41:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"nothing gives me a more fierce, cardinal urge to throw something very heavy at another humans head"
29-12-2020T23:41:23,CrRAR,":ctwokinds-rose:*[hey, that’s my line]"
29-12-2020T23:41:32,CrRAR,Like typical super markets even it’s like one type of thing counter
29-12-2020T23:42:32,CrRAR,"I mean just like someone who has to take orders at a phone and counter at like a sub shop, yeah they’re dashing around crazy at high times"
29-12-2020T23:42:54,CrRAR,"And honestly, most people should just expect an order to be taken"
29-12-2020T23:43:32,CrRAR,not a guided tour of everything all the time
29-12-2020T23:46:56,SpazztasticKiwi,anyhow
29-12-2020T23:47:19,SpazztasticKiwi,back to whatever tea time was happening before my stampede came barreling in
29-12-2020T23:48:04,CrRAR,tea gone
29-12-2020T23:48:20,CrRAR,gettin kinda late
29-12-2020T23:48:23,SpazztasticKiwi,..did it get busted across somebody’s face
