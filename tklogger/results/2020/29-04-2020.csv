29-04-2020T10:21:52,JojoGD,Morning
29-04-2020T10:55:46,AspiringNoodle,I wonder what kind of BS awaits me today :snake:
29-04-2020T10:56:12,AspiringNoodle,"Maybe the coffee pots have gone almost 2 weeks without being properly cleaned, that should be fun!"
29-04-2020T11:09:45,JojoGD,I want to decrease my time for rainbow road in mario kart
29-04-2020T11:15:17,AspiringNoodle,Step 1: Put down the controller
29-04-2020T11:15:22,AspiringNoodle,Step 2: Turn off the console
29-04-2020T11:15:26,AspiringNoodle,Step 3: Eject disk
29-04-2020T11:15:31,AspiringNoodle,Step 4: Smash disk
29-04-2020T11:15:32,AspiringNoodle,Done
29-04-2020T11:15:50,JojoGD,I had that mario game for a long time
29-04-2020T11:16:48,JojoGD,I beat some of my old records yesterday
29-04-2020T11:17:32,JojoGD,im having a zoom meeting right now
29-04-2020T11:45:04,AspiringNoodle,I go to work in 2 hours
29-04-2020T11:45:18,ThoseButterflys,ok
29-04-2020T11:45:21,AspiringNoodle,"If even only 2 days a week seems like it's too much, then it's probably not a good job, haha"
29-04-2020T11:48:07,JojoGD,good luck in 2 hours
29-04-2020T11:56:54,AspiringNoodle,I'm gonna be pretty pissed if I get there and find out that 1) We still don't have the cleaner for the coffee pots and 2) we're still serving coffee
29-04-2020T11:57:04,AspiringNoodle,When I worked last Saturday those things were disgusting.
29-04-2020T12:08:37,JojoGD,i need to get a windows pc
29-04-2020T12:22:08,AspiringNoodle,Apple leaves me so damn conflicted
29-04-2020T12:22:46,AspiringNoodle,"I will criticize them day and night for their pos hardware ""options"", design flaws, and active hostility towards independent repair"
29-04-2020T12:24:11,AspiringNoodle,"But they have some of the best software out there (but again, ""options""), their build quality tends to be superb, though other makers are catching up, finally, and those screens man..."
29-04-2020T12:25:12,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, if Apple opened up their OS for custom PC builds, that would be some major brownie points right htere"
29-04-2020T12:26:04,AspiringNoodle,"Actually, that would completely undo my 3 major gripes because if you weren't locked into their ecosystem and could install their OS on ANY machine of your choosing, then there'd really only be upsides"
29-04-2020T12:32:09,AspiringNoodle,*sigh* Fan boys...
29-04-2020T12:57:21,JojoGD,I finally got some cream for my coffee

29-04-2020T20:28:30,JojoGD,How I would like to start Pok√©mon game with a shiny starter
29-04-2020T20:29:17,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúyou‚Äôre putting my leg to sleep‚Äù
29-04-2020T20:29:32,SpazztasticKiwi,üêà: ‚Äúüí§‚Äù
29-04-2020T20:42:12,JojoGD,No luck so far
29-04-2020T21:05:14,JojoGD,Ok I‚Äôm done hunting a shiny for today
29-04-2020T22:14:11,K3IDRAN,Just finished. The MW2Rs Remastered Campaign
29-04-2020T22:14:20,K3IDRAN,Mw2*
29-04-2020T22:18:44,AspiringNoodle,"Well, I'm gonna start looking for a new job this weekend."
29-04-2020T22:20:02,RimaDraws,that doesn't sound fun
29-04-2020T22:22:28,AspiringNoodle,Finally got an answer on the coffee pots
29-04-2020T22:22:55,AspiringNoodle,"If we're out of the cleaner meant specifically for those things, we're supposed to refer to the wash - rinse - sanitize process in the washing area"
29-04-2020T22:23:34,AspiringNoodle,"Only problem, we can't pre-scrape / spray, and we sure as hell can't actually wash the inside."
29-04-2020T22:23:58,AspiringNoodle,"All we'd be able to do is fill the pots with soapy water, rinse them out, and then sanitize them."
29-04-2020T22:24:22,JojoGD,I decreased my record on rainbow road
29-04-2020T22:24:36,AspiringNoodle,"On top of that, this sounds like it'll take WAY more time than the proper way of cleaning them"
29-04-2020T22:24:58,AspiringNoodle,"Also, I have pics.  Anybody want to see them? xD"
29-04-2020T22:25:19,AspiringNoodle,I'll have to move them from my phone and put them on imgur.  See if I can make a private album
29-04-2020T22:25:24,JojoGD,I never thought I would pull off that trick 3 times in a row
29-04-2020T22:25:44,JojoGD,It was a 1/4 chance I was able to pull it off
29-04-2020T22:26:18,AspiringNoodle,"Ah yes, the infamous MK speed run tricks"
29-04-2020T22:26:26,AspiringNoodle,Some of them notoriously RNG-dependent
29-04-2020T22:26:41,JojoGD,"Mario Kart Wii, character: baby Mario, time 2:52:750"
29-04-2020T22:26:48,JojoGD,It‚Äôs timing
29-04-2020T22:27:13,JojoGD,Press b too early and the kart hits the bump
29-04-2020T22:27:23,JojoGD,Too late and the kart won‚Äôt fly
29-04-2020T22:28:10,JojoGD,I beat my brothers record and he was using Funky Kong
29-04-2020T22:29:34,AspiringNoodle,"Be Boo, clip through everything"
29-04-2020T22:29:40,AspiringNoodle,"""I'm not cheating, I'm a ghost!"""
29-04-2020T22:29:46,JojoGD,I‚Äôm just happy I was able to pull it off
29-04-2020T22:30:10,JojoGD,My best non mushroom run on rainbow road was a 2:55
29-04-2020T22:31:53,JojoGD,I killed my run by drifting
29-04-2020T22:34:46,JojoGD,Final lap and killed my run
29-04-2020T22:36:23,AspiringNoodle,Fun start tomorrow
29-04-2020T22:36:40,AspiringNoodle,"Planned mass call offs at Walmart, Amazon, Target, InstaCart, Whole Foods, and Fed Ex."
29-04-2020T22:36:53,AspiringNoodle,Let's see if more show up or if it's just a blip on the radar :D
29-04-2020T22:50:34,JojoGD,New record
29-04-2020T22:51:03,AspiringNoodle,You will never beat my record
29-04-2020T22:51:28,JojoGD,"Rainbow road wii, baby Mario, 2:50:995"
29-04-2020T22:52:02,JojoGD,I wanted a 2:51 but I got a 2:50
29-04-2020T22:52:17,JojoGD,I broke my record twice
29-04-2020T22:52:48,AspiringNoodle,0:00:000
29-04-2020T22:52:53,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-snicker:
29-04-2020T22:53:50,JojoGD,I can decease it using the short cut but it‚Äôs too risky
29-04-2020T22:55:56,JojoGD,I fluked once on this run
