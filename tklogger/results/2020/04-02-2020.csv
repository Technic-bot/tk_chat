04-02-2020T00:08:59,CrRAR,go for a high-protein diet
04-02-2020T00:09:14,CrRAR,"did you vanquish the fly, btw?"
04-02-2020T00:11:19,SpazztasticKiwi,he went quiet
04-02-2020T00:25:54,SpazztasticKiwi,probably knew his time was numbered
04-02-2020T00:26:07,SpazztasticKiwi,or got sucked in my fan
04-02-2020T00:32:47,CrRAR,:ok_hand:
04-02-2020T00:43:12,SpazztasticKiwi,then again flies live about 24 hours so maybe he just koed mid flight
04-02-2020T00:49:40,SpazztasticKiwi,of course he comes back now

04-02-2020T00:59:50,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs taunting me now and I know this cause it buzzed ~right~ over my head and in front of me

04-02-2020T01:01:18,CrRAR,The only way to get a fly is beserk mode.
04-02-2020T01:01:30,SpazztasticKiwi,after I watch ‚Äúhow 3d puzzles are made‚Äù
04-02-2020T01:01:40,CrRAR,Ooo
04-02-2020T01:01:44,SpazztasticKiwi,exactly
04-02-2020T01:01:49,SpazztasticKiwi,very oo
04-02-2020T01:02:18,CrRAR,I feel like there‚Äôs many not wrong ways to make a 3D puzzle.
04-02-2020T01:02:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"even better, the narrators got a voice like butter"
04-02-2020T01:02:50,CrRAR,Nice like a soft lullaby
04-02-2020T01:03:37,CrRAR,Does a rubiks cube qualify as a 3D puzzle?
04-02-2020T01:06:58,SpazztasticKiwi,so apparently you can order replacement puzzle pieces if you loose or find ones missing??
04-02-2020T01:07:42,CrRAR,"Wow, ‚ÄúEasy, just describe the piece you don‚Äôt have to us and we‚Äôll rush it to your door!‚Äù"
04-02-2020T01:07:58,CrRAR,‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like... a thing‚Äù
04-02-2020T01:08:52,CrRAR,‚ÄúIt has I think a hooky on one end and a spiker on the other‚Äù
04-02-2020T01:09:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"the way they describe it, you go to the company website"
04-02-2020T01:09:12,SpazztasticKiwi,find the puzzle you got
04-02-2020T01:09:18,CrRAR,I see
04-02-2020T01:09:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"look at the layout/diagram, whatever you call it, of said puzzle"
04-02-2020T01:09:44,SpazztasticKiwi,and order the piece id
04-02-2020T01:10:21,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
04-02-2020T01:10:41,SpazztasticKiwi,it makes sense that all have id numbers if they‚Äôre cut from one whole board
04-02-2020T01:10:53,CrRAR,Yeah
04-02-2020T01:11:18,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúso I‚Äôm looking for piece number 458 in this 1500 puzzle‚Äù
04-02-2020T01:12:20,SpazztasticKiwi,people are out here making 3d puzzles of new york blocks
04-02-2020T01:12:35,CrRAR,"I wonder how they manage to supply single pieces, maybe the just have boxes and boxes of entire sets?"
04-02-2020T01:13:30,SpazztasticKiwi,probably uses pieces from made kits they keep on site
04-02-2020T01:13:49,CrRAR,Yeah
04-02-2020T01:13:57,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure all these pieces will have someone that‚Äôs missing it‚Äù
