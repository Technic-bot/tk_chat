22-12-2020T21:09:07,AspiringNoodle,THAT IS CREEPILY RELEVANT TO THE SITUATION AND I AM A LITTLE FREAKED OUT D:
22-12-2020T21:10:19,CrRAR,"Freaky, though I expected a more prophetic matching quote"
22-12-2020T21:55:30,SpazztasticKiwi,🍖
22-12-2020T21:59:13,SpazztasticKiwi,often you don’t come across a relevant message by chance
22-12-2020T21:59:32,SpazztasticKiwi,they happen because they’re relevant
22-12-2020T22:14:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m a strong independent woman who don’t need no man
22-12-2020T22:15:13,SpazztasticKiwi,but I’d like to rent one at the moment to carry all this shit in

22-12-2020T23:00:52,SpazztasticKiwi,can you believe people are mad the Christmas candy got moved
22-12-2020T23:01:13,SpazztasticKiwi,and that we’re running out of certain stuff
22-12-2020T23:02:49,SpazztasticKiwi,and that Christmas is in like 24 hours so no we can’t make you that big order and have it ready before your party
22-12-2020T23:07:47,Ordithus,I'll believe it
22-12-2020T23:07:53,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-Disappoint:
22-12-2020T23:09:15,SpazztasticKiwi,there was a man that apparently rose a big fuss because even demanding the store manager didn’t get him what he wanted
22-12-2020T23:09:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"if we’re out, we’re out - there’s no summoning portal in the back"
22-12-2020T23:10:20,SpazztasticKiwi,& it’s not like this holiday rolls around every other 1000 years
22-12-2020T23:10:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Christmas doesn’t sneak up on you
22-12-2020T23:11:05,Ordithus,folks need to learn to c h i l l
22-12-2020T23:11:22,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rainehappy: like outside!
22-12-2020T23:34:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I know we established the scale for girlfriend/cat/Nora/cat Nora falling asleep in your lap
22-12-2020T23:35:04,SpazztasticKiwi,but where does girl you know and girl you don’t know land
22-12-2020T23:35:18,SpazztasticKiwi,and crush
22-12-2020T23:45:05,Ordithus,I was not there for the scale what did we establish
22-12-2020T23:46:57,SpazztasticKiwi,cat asleep on you < girlfriend asleep on you < Nora asleep on you < cat Nora asleep on you
22-12-2020T23:47:57,SpazztasticKiwi,cat is cuteness but you will move if necessary for life
22-12-2020T23:48:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"girlfriend, same but also you’re willing to let limbs fall asleep before considering moving"
22-12-2020T23:49:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"with Nora in any form, there’s the question if you CAN move, let alone if you DARE try"
22-12-2020T23:49:34,Ordithus,":ctwokinds-floraquestion: hmm so in order of ""will I move"" and not desire"
22-12-2020T23:51:55,SpazztasticKiwi,oh that would be another important study to establish entirely
22-12-2020T23:52:21,Ordithus,"on this scale, girl I know below girlfriend, but above cat. sorry, cat"
22-12-2020T23:53:01,Ordithus,"crush, below cat. AWKWARD"
22-12-2020T23:53:13,Ordithus,"girl I don't know, now that is a mystery"
22-12-2020T23:53:23,Ordithus,just how dangerous is this person
22-12-2020T23:54:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"two scenarios, some chick zonks out on your shoulder on the bus vs girl you just met at say a gathering kos on you"
22-12-2020T23:55:10,SpazztasticKiwi,other variables are they’re very mildly or not attractive & age
22-12-2020T23:55:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"but in general hot or not regardless of age, you’re finding yourself on the floor before you sleep on me"
22-12-2020T23:56:19,Ordithus,if there is drool I am right out
