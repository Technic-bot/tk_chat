17-10-2020T17:11:02,PalmettoPathfinder1,I think next month I'll suggest Jeso's Tyla meeting Flora and Trace.  Flora is very overprotective of Trace.  :D]
17-10-2020T17:11:07,ProsePro7,Playing Hallow Knight right now...that game is fun bu irritating
17-10-2020T17:11:16,Roughlandin,Wait? Twokinds was gonna be an Isekai?
17-10-2020T17:11:19,PalmettoPathfinder1,Wow Tom that's interesting!
17-10-2020T17:11:32,Twokinds,"No, not an Isekai"
17-10-2020T17:11:38,ProsePro7,AU potenial...could be another April Fools joke
17-10-2020T17:11:42,Twokinds,Just a game world
17-10-2020T17:11:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Something like Monster Rancher?
17-10-2020T17:11:49,Roughlandin,Ah got it
17-10-2020T17:11:50,unsteddyphoenix,it still COULD be...
17-10-2020T17:11:55,ThingsAreMoving,:notes: do you want to date my avatar? :notes:
17-10-2020T17:12:03,ProsePro7,Sounds more like Choatics
17-10-2020T17:12:07,BadFoMo,I remember seeing thoes firest 3(?) pages.
17-10-2020T17:12:33,Roughlandin,I wonder how much EXP Team B got when they beat Carver?
17-10-2020T17:12:45,Ordithus,1 xp
17-10-2020T17:12:49,KeefMcDerpface,lol
17-10-2020T17:12:49,Roughlandin,Lol
17-10-2020T17:12:53,tehbear,they leveled up for sure
17-10-2020T17:12:58,ProsePro7,They did it with a cheat code no exp
17-10-2020T17:13:14,KeefMcDerpface,Nibbly got all the EXP.
17-10-2020T17:13:14,Roughlandin,Carver's power level was 1 Raditz
17-10-2020T17:13:30,ProsePro7,Thats the same as a Saibaman
17-10-2020T17:13:48,Twokinds,The original first page had a text box saying Trace was lvl 7 or something
17-10-2020T17:13:58,Twokinds,He was planned to be a fighter and Flora was a mage
17-10-2020T17:14:07,KeefMcDerpface,ooooh
17-10-2020T17:14:13,Ordithus,a bit opposite haha
17-10-2020T17:14:13,CrimsonQuill,"Nah, the XP'd be split between Zen (Smash crystal), Nibs (Squirrel attack) and Raine (Teleport trick)"
17-10-2020T17:14:15,falangie123,so his memories got lost when he forgot to save his game?
17-10-2020T17:14:18,Roughlandin,Then the reclassed lol
17-10-2020T17:14:23,Roughlandin,Like Ord said
17-10-2020T17:14:23,ProsePro7,...You made the right choice to change it Tom
17-10-2020T17:14:39,Twokinds,Well yeah it didn't work
17-10-2020T17:14:50,unsteddyphoenix,Now Floras the fighter
17-10-2020T17:15:01,Ordithus,she's a rogue
17-10-2020T17:15:04,PalmettoPathfinder1,You know I wonder what would be Jeso's Tyla's reaction if she was Nibs Nab.  :D
17-10-2020T17:15:05,Ordithus,backpounces
17-10-2020T17:15:55,CrimsonQuill,"Didn't you say you came up with team B before team A? How did you come up with the characters of Trace and Flora themselves, and what role would team B have had before?"
17-10-2020T17:15:55,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-traceflohug:*[Sneak attack!]
17-10-2020T17:16:04,Roughlandin,And Trace is a Level 7 druid. Explains all the Keidran. He must have specced Befriend Animal
17-10-2020T17:16:12,PalmettoPathfinder1,"@unsteddyphoenix wait, I thought Flora was the barbarian?"
17-10-2020T17:16:28,ThingsAreMoving,Flora is multiclassing
17-10-2020T17:16:29,FloofyCat,In before the Twokinds HxH Greed Island arc :eyes:
17-10-2020T17:16:30,ThingsAreMoving,looks like
17-10-2020T17:16:50,PalmettoPathfinder1,@ThingsAreMoving That works for me!
17-10-2020T17:17:21,InTheLionsDen,:saxophone::ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
17-10-2020T17:17:27,ShamusTheFox,Skidd tried something similar with his webcomic too. It didn't really work either.
17-10-2020T17:17:47,Roughlandin,Lady Nora. Class: Royal Dragon Archmage. Level: ???
17-10-2020T17:18:09,falangie123,Artificial Incident works well though
17-10-2020T17:18:48,ShamusTheFox,I neec to binge read that at some point.
17-10-2020T17:18:49,Dimensional,At least Nora isn't like Aqua from Kono Suba.
17-10-2020T17:18:56,PalmettoPathfinder1,The only being that is more powerful than Nora is Tom and the magic pen!
17-10-2020T17:18:57,falangie123,it's the only other webcomic I consistently follow
17-10-2020T17:19:09,Roughlandin,"Trace should have figured something was up when the gang entered the manor and heard ""Warning. Your party may be underleveled for this area. Save? Reload? Warp to Hub?"""
17-10-2020T17:19:20,KeefMcDerpface,lol
17-10-2020T17:19:26,Roughlandin,Hi Keef!
17-10-2020T17:19:41,KeefMcDerpface,\o
17-10-2020T17:19:42,CrimsonQuill,hello keef
17-10-2020T17:21:52,ShamusTheFox,"I read Twokinds (obviously), Freefall, Foxy Flavored Cookie, Faux Pas, Las Lindas, Rascals, Bittersweet Candy Bowl, and a couple of others."
17-10-2020T17:22:11,Roughlandin,Wait. If this is a Square Enix title... Twokinds level confirmed for Kingdom Hearts 4?
17-10-2020T17:22:18,PalmettoPathfinder1,@ShamusTheFox wahat about Cyantian Chronicles?  One of my favorite webcomics.
17-10-2020T17:22:48,ShamusTheFox,"I may have at one point. Palmetto, it sounds familiar."
17-10-2020T17:23:27,thestooge2222,I'd love to see more of Flora in that devil costume from the last sketch!
17-10-2020T17:24:08,Roughlandin,"She's always wearing it, but you can only see it on Halloween."
17-10-2020T17:24:38,ShamusTheFox,"I've also read Black Tapestries, Peter and Company, Peter and Whitney, Peter is the Wolf (lotta peters), Professor Amazing and the Incredible Golden Fox, By The Book..."
17-10-2020T17:25:01,ShamusTheFox,Some I haven't read in a while.
17-10-2020T17:25:06,microbuss,looking great
17-10-2020T17:25:44,CrimsonQuill,"I have a bunch on standby...Lackdaisy, the Whiteboard, Dan n Mab, etc"
17-10-2020T17:26:00,Roughlandin,Haven't kept up with Lackadaisy in a while
17-10-2020T17:26:13,ShamusTheFox,I have read some of Lackadaisy and Dan and Mab.
17-10-2020T17:26:20,BadFoMo,Back. What is this one again?
17-10-2020T17:26:29,CrimsonQuill,Bravely Default
17-10-2020T17:26:37,Roughlandin,The main four as the cast of Bravely Default
17-10-2020T17:26:37,ShamusTheFox,"Oh, Swords and Sausages is a cute comic too."
17-10-2020T17:26:43,BadFoMo,Never heard of it.
17-10-2020T17:27:01,Roughlandin,A cult Square Enix JRPG for the 3Ds
17-10-2020T17:27:13,Ordithus,"Looks interesting, but I don't have a 3ds"
17-10-2020T17:27:35,PalmettoPathfinder1,"There was Roomies webcomic but it died out and well, is no longer up.  Heck even Wayback Machine can't even find the pics anymore."
17-10-2020T17:27:37,Roughlandin,I do but I don't have the time for most Square Enix JRPGs
17-10-2020T17:27:57,ProsePro7,Did someone say Squinix?
17-10-2020T17:27:59,ShamusTheFox,"Ah, I remember Roomies. I thought it ended the run."
17-10-2020T17:28:03,ThingsAreMoving,"Does it run on switch, too?"
17-10-2020T17:28:08,TeapotOfDoom,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
17-10-2020T17:28:24,Roughlandin,Roomies? Isn't he still posting stuff on FA?
17-10-2020T17:28:26,ProsePro7,"Best JRPG was Legends of Dragoon, screw you fight me!"
17-10-2020T17:28:28,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-nibsdance: could add it to my growing catalog of jrpgs to play
17-10-2020T17:28:37,ShamusTheFox,"Oh, Flinters is doing art all over."
17-10-2020T17:28:52,ShamusTheFox,But maybe not Roomies.
17-10-2020T17:28:58,ThingsAreMoving,"Prose, I respect your opinion, but Chrono trigger is objectively better"
17-10-2020T17:29:00,BadFoMo,"I know my 'friend' has a 3DS, but that was mostly just to play GTA:CTW."
17-10-2020T17:29:04,RedEyesWheeler,Never played Legends of Dragoon
17-10-2020T17:29:27,Roughlandin,"Oh, Flinters' Roomies. I was thinking of a different webcomic"
17-10-2020T17:29:56,ShamusTheFox,There may have been more than one.
17-10-2020T17:30:35,Roughlandin,I was thinking of one by MadCatter
17-10-2020T17:30:39,Roughlandin,Can't remember the name of it
17-10-2020T17:31:10,Roughlandin,It was also called Roomies lo
17-10-2020T17:31:12,Roughlandin,lol
17-10-2020T17:31:36,Brocade,he rebooted that comic like three times
17-10-2020T17:31:55,Brocade,"and then Luvon revealed how abusive he was and like, I guess he kind of disappeared"
17-10-2020T17:32:10,Roughlandin,Yikes. Didn't hear about all that
17-10-2020T17:32:24,Ordithus,Flora is looking adorable <3
17-10-2020T17:32:25,Brocade,this must have been like 7 years ago
17-10-2020T17:33:14,Roughlandin,I think this is the most clothed Flora has ever been
17-10-2020T17:33:35,ShamusTheFox,"I used to read Jack. It was not really my cup of tea, but it was well written."
17-10-2020T17:34:21,GammaEradon,"If we're talking furry webcomics: Ozy and Millie is classic, now she's doing Phoebe and Her Unicorn."
17-10-2020T17:34:29,ProsePro7,@Roughlandin I thought that we put her in a Victorian outfit once?
17-10-2020T17:34:37,GammaEradon,Slightly Damned is also great.
17-10-2020T17:34:51,Roughlandin,Oh! I almost forgot about Out of Placers by Valsalia. That's probably the one I keep most up to date on besides Twokinds
17-10-2020T17:34:54,ShamusTheFox,"Oh, Housepets too, I read that. And Slightly Damned, yes."
17-10-2020T17:35:13,ProsePro7,@GammaEradon That sounds like a Romance Novel
17-10-2020T17:35:16,ShamusTheFox,Out of Placers is great. Yinglets are goofy.
17-10-2020T17:35:29,ProsePro7,Housepets is very good
17-10-2020T17:35:40,Roughlandin,Val's great at humor and the worldbuilding is super cool
17-10-2020T17:36:17,Roughlandin,Other than that would be Sunstone. Which is... not really in the same vein as the rest of these
17-10-2020T17:36:21,GammaEradon,"Twin Dragons, Galactic Dragons, DMFA, Faux Paws, Housepets, Savestate, Tamberlane, Freefall..."
17-10-2020T17:36:37,ShamusTheFox,"Oh yes, Savestate!"
17-10-2020T17:36:37,ThingsAreMoving,Tamberlane is nice
17-10-2020T17:36:37,Roughlandin,Is Faux Paws still updating?
17-10-2020T17:36:41,Sclimshady,Flora looks great in this outfit
17-10-2020T17:36:55,ShamusTheFox,And Tamberlane is really amazing.
17-10-2020T17:37:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,You look great in that outfit
17-10-2020T17:37:26,ProsePro7,Anyone seen Zoophobia?
17-10-2020T17:37:40,ShamusTheFox,That old coyote grandpa is my spirit animal
17-10-2020T17:37:57,ThingsAreMoving,I've read Zoophobia at some point
17-10-2020T17:38:18,Sclimshady,Thanks bb
17-10-2020T17:38:30,thestooge2222,"I did years ago, been getting around to watching the new short"
17-10-2020T17:38:34,Roughlandin,For some reason that just reminded me of the Wolf Grandpa from those COPD drug commercials
17-10-2020T17:38:40,AspiringNoodle,"I started reading Zoophoba, but then I stopped when I found out it was abandoned"
17-10-2020T17:38:45,ProsePro7,After I saw the animation Vizie let out I went and read it.  She hasnt updated it in four years.  Guess she has been busy
17-10-2020T17:39:15,AspiringNoodle,Yeah... makes me think about how much time I waste
17-10-2020T17:39:16,ShamusTheFox,There are some good comics out there that just stop.
17-10-2020T17:39:18,Roughlandin,"Oh! Vizie. Yeah, she's kinda dumped the furry side of her art"
17-10-2020T17:39:26,AspiringNoodle,And what I could do if I cut all my time wasters in half
17-10-2020T17:39:39,Roughlandin,She's all about getting Hazbin Hotel off the ground now
17-10-2020T17:39:44,ProsePro7,Rough have you seen HazbinHotel?  The furry stuff is sill there
17-10-2020T17:39:45,HeresyArtStream,Mow mow! :cheresyartstream-harrywave01:

17-10-2020T17:40:54,GammaEradon,"Ah, yes, speaking of furry webcomics, been enjoying Lancers so far (by Heresy)"
17-10-2020T17:41:26,Roughlandin,Oh yeah I forgot Heresy started a Webcomic

17-10-2020T17:50:02,Ordithus,Tom is to blame for many things~
17-10-2020T17:50:11,ThingsAreMoving,Agreed
17-10-2020T17:50:14,Roughlandin,Yeah. Everybody knows Tom has no other friends with webcomics! Other than... all of them

17-10-2020T17:54:27,Twokinds,That's kinda how I started too. I wanted to do games but didn't know how. But I could try to draw.
17-10-2020T17:54:28,ProsePro7,"Most good stories take years of build up.  Star Wars was first written in 1970, Elrick was written in 1965, Game of Thrones was written in 1985, quality takes time."
17-10-2020T17:54:31,CrimsonQuill,I look forward to reading it.
17-10-2020T17:54:39,Roughlandin,"Same for me, but with drawing. Now I'm at the ""stare at half finished stories and will them to write themselves"" phase"
17-10-2020T17:54:45,Tufi,❤❤❤❤
17-10-2020T17:54:46,CrimsonQuill,I've been drawing since I was a baby
17-10-2020T17:55:04,CrimsonQuill,Drew lotsa 17th-18th century warships or WW1-2 battles
17-10-2020T17:55:05,ProsePro7,I'm one level down.  I cant draw so I write instead
17-10-2020T17:55:09,HeresyArtStream,"I was having more fun coming up with the story than trying to learn how to program or do game design, and my ambitions were way too big for a little indie project made by 1-3 people."
17-10-2020T17:55:13,CrimsonQuill,Or Calvin&Hobbes knockoffs
17-10-2020T17:55:14,Ordithus,"Keith looks happy, the world must be ending"
17-10-2020T17:55:19,Roughlandin,These bear hands can draw nothing but stick figures
17-10-2020T17:55:58,Roughlandin,"Like I said, Keith's just happy he's not the one in the dress for once"
17-10-2020T17:56:11,ThingsAreMoving,I'm happy that I can enjoy seeing my favorite artists' art while it's being drawn
17-10-2020T17:56:21,CrimsonQuill,"I'm coming up with concepts for a Halo fancomic now called Fireteam Luna, with Raine as a guest character (it started out  as me thinking that she needed more people in her fireteam and blew up from there)"
17-10-2020T17:56:24,HeresyArtStream,And I can always do a game later if it gets popular enough. Something dramatically scaled back and more achievable.
17-10-2020T17:56:45,CrimsonQuill,I've just finished a little comic with another Halo artist's OCs..they were really helpful
17-10-2020T17:56:50,CrimsonQuill,I want to draw more.
17-10-2020T17:56:52,HeresyArtStream,I am doing the story all by myself as a comic and I have full creative control over it. I'd be happy to settle for something simple and retro style as far as a game goes.
17-10-2020T17:57:00,ProsePro7,You and me are on the same thought path Heresy
17-10-2020T17:57:33,CrimsonQuill,@HeresyArtStream That's kind of the line of thinking I had except I never thought about game
17-10-2020T17:57:35,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,This is looking Awesome Tom!!! <3
17-10-2020T17:57:43,OtherStuffJT,I'm the opposite I'm designing a custom computer(from scratch no x86) to make a game because I cant draw
17-10-2020T17:57:50,HeresyArtStream,Me and my brother also have some ideas for a card game spinoff that we might be able to do at some point in the future. It'd be a simple fast game kind of like Coup.
17-10-2020T17:57:58,CrimsonQuill,Neato!
17-10-2020T17:58:05,Dimensional,I'm surprised Keith isn't wearing a maiden's outfit. XD
17-10-2020T17:58:21,Twokinds,These characters are wearing a lot of leather
17-10-2020T17:58:28,Twokinds,Every single one has leather gloves and boots
17-10-2020T17:58:30,Roughlandin,Kinky
17-10-2020T17:58:34,KeefMcDerpface,hehe
17-10-2020T17:58:35,Twokinds,The artist clearly likes this look
17-10-2020T17:58:55,Sclimshady,I too like this look
17-10-2020T17:58:58,FoxxTrotter,Hell Bent For Leather.
17-10-2020T17:59:16,HeresyArtStream,Something I reeeeallly want to do is toys.
17-10-2020T17:59:17,AspiringNoodle,"Laura in the back: ""I want to wear lots of leather ;-;"""
17-10-2020T17:59:23,HeresyArtStream,Toys and models.
17-10-2020T17:59:26,ThingsAreMoving,well known fact that leather gloves improve your music
17-10-2020T17:59:30,KeefMcDerpface,Should of gone to Kat's for more options...
17-10-2020T17:59:30,unsteddyphoenix,leather armour good light armour
17-10-2020T17:59:50,CrimsonQuill,It looks practical
17-10-2020T18:00:04,Roughlandin,"Well at least the outfits are actually covering the vital areas. More than can be said for a lot of JRPG ""armor"""
17-10-2020T18:00:34,HeresyArtStream,At some point I am either going to have to fix up my ship models to make them 3D-printable or I'll have to hire someone to re-do them properly. :V
17-10-2020T18:01:07,Roughlandin,A furry Armada style tabletop game sounds interesting
17-10-2020T18:02:00,ProsePro7,Like a battle of the species kind of thing?
17-10-2020T18:02:04,BadFoMo,Back. What are we talking about?
17-10-2020T18:02:08,KeefMcDerpface,wb
17-10-2020T18:02:20,HeresyArtStream,merchandising hopes and aspirations
17-10-2020T18:02:25,Twokinds,Hiring someone to do 3d can get expensive
17-10-2020T18:02:29,HeresyArtStream,yep
17-10-2020T18:02:35,ProsePro7,Very Expensive
17-10-2020T18:02:36,Roughlandin,Personal projects and how much leather these JRPG children are wearing
17-10-2020T18:02:39,HeresyArtStream,I am not even good at it and I wouldn't want to do it for cheap. -o-
17-10-2020T18:03:06,HeresyArtStream,I should probably just fix my stuff at some point. I was never good at 3D character modeling though.
17-10-2020T18:03:32,ShamusTheFox,"Heresy, do you have ship specs available somewhere?"
17-10-2020T18:03:32,HeresyArtStream,Maybe I could get proficient enough at Z-brush to do 3D sculpts of my characters but that's something I might be better off just biting the bullet on and hiring someone that's good at it.
17-10-2020T18:03:39,HeresyArtStream,"Not yet, Shamus"
17-10-2020T18:03:41,AspiringNoodle,"I should try some 3d character modeling, haha"
17-10-2020T18:03:50,ShamusTheFox,Gotcha gotcha
17-10-2020T18:03:56,AspiringNoodle,"According to my one professor, I seemed to have a knack for 3d work over 2d, anyways :snake:"
17-10-2020T18:04:00,HeresyArtStream,Eventually I will have full write ups for the specs on all the ships and orthographic renders of them.
17-10-2020T18:04:19,Roughlandin,What does writing count as? 1D? I can that.
17-10-2020T18:04:24,Ordithus,This is looking real good
17-10-2020T18:04:41,Roughlandin,These bois look like they're ready for some 'ventures!
17-10-2020T18:04:55,HeresyArtStream,"I went to animation school and I had a knack for 2D animation, while struggling with the 3D courses. And of course, that was right as the 2D animation industry in the US was dying."
17-10-2020T18:04:57,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-smug:*[Breezy]
17-10-2020T18:05:03,ShamusTheFox,"Having been a fan of the Wing Commander series, I am always interested in differing ship specs and loadouts."
17-10-2020T18:05:23,HeresyArtStream,Man I loved the blueprints that came with Wing Commander 1.
17-10-2020T18:05:47,HeresyArtStream,There's a little bit of visual influence from Wing Commander in my comic.
17-10-2020T18:05:50,ShamusTheFox,Agreed
17-10-2020T18:06:11,HeresyArtStream,"I plan on doing blueprints of my ships, it's just that it's going to take a long time to draw them."
17-10-2020T18:06:19,Roughlandin,"Easy, Breezy, Beautiful, Natani"
17-10-2020T18:06:33,HeresyArtStream,"Not as long as it would if I didn't have 3D models, but even when I'm tracing my models it can take a while to draw the ships."
17-10-2020T18:06:44,RheagarsArtEmporium,"I love this one, really hope it gets a coloring"

17-10-2020T18:10:01,Roughlandin,I figured it wouldn't take that long. Not a super involved pose. Just a lot of characters... and leather
17-10-2020T18:10:34,BadFoMo,@Roughlandin DeFur? The Keidran and Basitins are to be shaved?
17-10-2020T18:10:42,CrimsonQuill,It looks beautiful...

17-10-2020T18:12:12,ShamusTheFox,"I'm curious Tom, do you ever have Twokinds dreams? Like, interacting with your own creations and stuff?"
17-10-2020T18:12:33,Ordithus,"that was a Halloween page years ago, prose, yeah"
17-10-2020T18:12:44,ProsePro7,At first I bet he did but it has faded over they years probably
17-10-2020T18:12:47,BadFoMo,@ProsePro7 You're right! We did!
17-10-2020T18:13:05,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,great work Tom!!
17-10-2020T18:13:12,Twokinds,"no, oddly"
17-10-2020T18:13:31,Roughlandin,Who dreams about work?
17-10-2020T18:13:32,ShamusTheFox,"Ah, gotcha gotcha."
17-10-2020T18:13:35,ProsePro7,That is weird considering how much you work on it
17-10-2020T18:13:46,Twokinds,"You'd think I would considering how much time I spend working on Twokinds, and how dreams supposedly reflect what you dwell on. But no, I don't dream about Twokinds."
17-10-2020T18:13:49,Ordithus,"I believe that would be a nightmare, rough"
17-10-2020T18:14:10,unsteddyphoenix,Stupid brain not delivering free dream-generated content
17-10-2020T18:14:17,Roughlandin,Hence why Tom dreams about boring people working in Office cubicles
17-10-2020T18:14:19,unsteddyphoenix,Would be so convinient
17-10-2020T18:14:23,CrRAR,lol
17-10-2020T18:14:25,ThingsAreMoving,Do you dream of electric sheep?

17-10-2020T18:14:29,BadFoMo,...Do you dream of Rabbits then?
17-10-2020T18:14:29,Twokinds,I sometimes dream about drawing at my desk.
17-10-2020T18:14:34,Brocade,"I dream about shit I'm worried about, so yeah, work comes up pretty often"
17-10-2020T18:14:46,CrimsonQuill,Don't know what my dreams are

17-10-2020T18:14:53,ShamusTheFox,"Ah, that definitely checks out as a work related thing."
17-10-2020T18:15:03,CrimsonQuill,But nightmares are dreams too...
17-10-2020T18:15:03,SpazztasticKiwi,bold of y’all to assume he sleeps

17-10-2020T18:15:15,Roughlandin,Sometimes I dream that I'm a human and not a bear. It's terrifying!
17-10-2020T18:15:41,SpazztasticKiwi,a vacation means going outside
17-10-2020T18:15:55,ThingsAreMoving,does it?
17-10-2020T18:16:00,Roughlandin,Not in 2020 it doesn't
17-10-2020T18:16:27,SpazztasticKiwi,since a vacation usually means going away from work & Tom works from home

17-10-2020T22:05:26,Roughlandin,Loki might spare you. Evils won't. And that is... *Shivers.*

17-10-2020T23:49:19,BlackjackSec99,Saria would have bribed the publisher to have Rose be one of the bonus months.
17-10-2020T23:49:37,KeefMcDerpface,But this is a male calendar.

17-10-2020T23:55:21,SpazztasticKiwi,and under no circumstances in this calendar do they wear anything more than aprons (also I must add Mike and Evals dusting the halls)
17-10-2020T23:55:51,Ordithus,gotta keep the fur clean
17-10-2020T23:55:58,Dadrobit,Literally just that one Megan Fox image from forever ago but it's Clovis.
