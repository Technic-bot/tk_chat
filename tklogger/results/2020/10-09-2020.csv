10-09-2020T11:27:16,JojoGD,morning noodle
10-09-2020T11:27:19,CrimsonQuill,@AspiringNoodle turns out my=
10-09-2020T11:27:21,CrimsonQuill,Oops
10-09-2020T11:27:27,CrimsonQuill,Nevermind
10-09-2020T11:27:44,AspiringNoodle,Past few days have been fun
10-09-2020T11:28:56,CrimsonQuill,How's it been done?
10-09-2020T11:29:46,AspiringNoodle,"Yesterday, I had slept 12 - 13 hours the previous night, was up for 7.5 hours before crashing.  Slept for ~4 hours.  Was up for another 2, then slept until now for ~7"
10-09-2020T11:30:10,CrimsonQuill,Yeesh. Sleep schedule all over the place.
10-09-2020T11:30:28,AspiringNoodle,"So, been up for 9.5 hours vs 24 hours of sleep?"
10-09-2020T11:31:10,CrimsonQuill,Decent sleep anyway
10-09-2020T11:31:12,CrimsonQuill,I hope
10-09-2020T11:31:29,JojoGD,my brain is fried
10-09-2020T11:31:55,CrimsonQuill,Medium rare or well done?
10-09-2020T11:32:56,JojoGD,well done
10-09-2020T11:32:59,AspiringNoodle,Same
10-09-2020T11:33:16,JojoGD,more like creamated
10-09-2020T11:33:54,AspiringNoodle,"That whole mantra about minimum wage jobs is no lie (at least if you actually try / give a damn, anyways)"
10-09-2020T11:35:24,CrimsonQuill,It seems to me that some of the most important jobs are minimum wage
10-09-2020T11:35:27,CrimsonQuill,builder
10-09-2020T11:35:30,CrimsonQuill,sewage
10-09-2020T11:35:34,CrimsonQuill,all that malarkey
10-09-2020T11:36:22,CrRAR,♫ We built this city ♫
10-09-2020T11:36:36,CrRAR,♫ on minimummmm waaageeee ♫
10-09-2020T11:36:38,AspiringNoodle,I find it ironic that the jobs most critical to modern life are the ones that are *always* being justified as deserving a low wage
10-09-2020T11:36:46,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-adiracoin:
10-09-2020T11:37:00,AspiringNoodle,"Like, farmers make as much as a bank clerk, but they work way harder"
10-09-2020T11:37:15,AspiringNoodle,And their job is a *liiiiiiiiiiittle* more important
10-09-2020T11:38:08,CrRAR,"yup no farmers, no foodz"
10-09-2020T11:39:00,JojoGD,I need to reread Twokinds again
10-09-2020T11:39:06,AspiringNoodle,"And at the same time, the job that are pure luxury by comparison are the ones that pay ridiculously well"
10-09-2020T11:39:43,CrRAR,"Yeah, you forget some of the side details in different sections."
10-09-2020T11:40:44,AspiringNoodle,Yeah... I should probably reread the comic again
10-09-2020T11:41:04,AspiringNoodle,"But at the same time, some details from earlier sections of the comic get either swept under the rug or retconned xD"
10-09-2020T11:41:42,AspiringNoodle,Also weird.  Was checking my paycheck for this week
10-09-2020T11:41:57,AspiringNoodle,"Got one for $214.23, and a second payment for $31.65"
10-09-2020T11:42:10,AspiringNoodle,I wonder what the second one is about... especially since it came before the other one.
10-09-2020T11:50:33,CrRAR,There are some subtle things too that will seem more significant too in light of more recent events occasionally.
10-09-2020T11:52:13,CrRAR,...I'm just waiting for Maddie to fulfill that promise of endless coffee for Landen.

10-09-2020T11:59:57,CrimsonQuill,But chapter s 9 onward are where things pick up.

10-09-2020T18:57:17,SpazztasticKiwi,you think anyone would have a fit if there was a zombie rose suggested
10-09-2020T18:57:36,CrRAR,"How about if Sythe never escapes squirrel form and we get a snapshot of domestic squirrel life in a tree-bough home, with like several squirrel babies and Sythe desperatly trying to just watch TV or something and they're all just annoyingly adorable"

10-09-2020T20:21:43,SageSaga,ive only gotten food poisoning once- it was so long ago i just remember it was either an olive garden or a red lobster- cant remember which
10-09-2020T20:21:49,Nekonny,The one time I got it bad I think it was this undercooked egg from aa ramen dish in japan
10-09-2020T20:21:52,CrRAR,proooobably red lobster

10-09-2020T20:23:00,BADBackgroundProductions,Food poisoning sounds great 🤮
10-09-2020T20:23:01,Ordithus,docs thought it was appendicitis.  turned out to be intestinal torsion or something

10-09-2020T20:23:09,CrRAR,still friends ord? or did that end it?
