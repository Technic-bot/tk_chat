10-05-2020T23:39:58,Dadrobit,TFW you will never look as shredded as a 12 year old.
10-05-2020T23:40:12,AspiringNoodle,"How did I f*cking know you were gonna pull THAT kid up, lmao"
10-05-2020T23:40:34,Dadrobit,He's actually doing really well now.
10-05-2020T23:40:45,AspiringNoodle,"If I remember, isn't he a surfer now?"
10-05-2020T23:40:52,AspiringNoodle,Still fit but nowhere near what he was as a child?
10-05-2020T23:40:53,Dadrobit,"Has a good ""I eat right and exercise"" body now."
10-05-2020T23:41:09,AspiringNoodle,Because if I remember correctly part of it was one of his parents pushing him

10-05-2020T23:42:21,AspiringNoodle,Dude looks good
10-05-2020T23:42:23,Dadrobit,They raised him from a toddler to accept his way of life.
10-05-2020T23:42:54,Dadrobit,"IIRC, he got out after his father became psychotic and injured his mother."

10-05-2020T23:45:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"only time we see anything of him unclothed, and it‚Äôs barely half his chest"
10-05-2020T23:48:05,Dadrobit,"oh man, watching a few clips on YouTube of Inuyasha, and man, that animation... Not aging well."
10-05-2020T23:48:52,Dadrobit,"Still frame, zoom in/out, lip flaps, maybe a head tilt."
10-05-2020T23:49:04,Dadrobit,We have come a long way.
10-05-2020T23:49:49,SpazztasticKiwi,final act is better
10-05-2020T23:50:23,SpazztasticKiwi,there‚Äôs animation jumps in one of the movies
10-05-2020T23:50:55,Dadrobit,"Yeah, movies always have higher production/ budget."
10-05-2020T23:53:04,Dadrobit,"Unless you're Kyoto Animation, then everything you do is fucking platinum."
10-05-2020T23:54:04,SpazztasticKiwi,did you ever finish it
10-05-2020T23:54:14,Dadrobit,what?
10-05-2020T23:54:31,Dadrobit,"Oh, Inuyasha?"
10-05-2020T23:54:34,AspiringNoodle,"Dadro, I know what you mean, haha"
10-05-2020T23:54:52,AspiringNoodle,"Last year I watched Trigun.  Oh man, it was good, but you can tell how much anime has evolved since then"
10-05-2020T23:54:53,Dadrobit,"Yeah, read it over the course of a semester or so."
10-05-2020T23:55:15,AspiringNoodle,"Definitely helps that now they can make everything digitally, speeds EVERYTHING up"
10-05-2020T23:56:30,Dadrobit,Digital animation is a tool. Depends on the workers to implement it correctly.
10-05-2020T23:57:27,Dadrobit,Digital animation's been around since Akira. 32 years later and shows are still fucking it up.
10-05-2020T23:57:42,AspiringNoodle,"True, but from an objective standpoint, digital is faster"
10-05-2020T23:58:18,Dadrobit,But speed wasn't what I was talking about. Just general animation quality.
10-05-2020T23:58:38,AspiringNoodle,"Oh yeah, no, you can have the best tools in the world and still f*ck that up, ahahahaha"
10-05-2020T23:58:55,AspiringNoodle,...I wanna watch Akira again
10-05-2020T23:59:03,AspiringNoodle,Wasn't that film all traditional?
10-05-2020T23:59:56,SpazztasticKiwi,takes something like 200 years for the two brothers to stop fighting
10-05-2020T23:59:59,Dadrobit,It was the first to implement computer animation as part of the process
