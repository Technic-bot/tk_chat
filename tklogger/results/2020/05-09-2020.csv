05-09-2020T13:24:59,CrRAR,"hopefully he's feeling better, either way."
05-09-2020T13:25:28,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,I believe Sage said it was food poisoning yesterday

05-09-2020T14:02:50,Azumachan,How are you ? Feeling any better ?
05-09-2020T14:03:00,Twokinds,Yesterday was one of the worst days I've ever had.
05-09-2020T14:03:15,Twokinds,Today I finally woke up without throwing up.
05-09-2020T14:03:36,Twokinds,"Feel better, but everything's still sore."
05-09-2020T14:04:04,Azumachan,Then rest.
05-09-2020T14:09:52,BeautyAndTheBeef,did you at least get some sleep ?
05-09-2020T14:20:20,TerraTheWizard,oh dang
05-09-2020T14:20:31,TerraTheWizard,here's to a speedy recovery :ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
05-09-2020T14:24:20,BadFoMo,"Yes, get well soon, Tom."
05-09-2020T14:24:28,BadFoMo,I suddenly have an urge to post a pic of Renamon vomiting a rainbow.
05-09-2020T14:24:40,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Get well soon Tom <3
05-09-2020T14:25:39,Roughlandin,"Ouch, Tom. If you need to postpone the stream for a day, I think we'd understand. Don't literally suffer for your art lol"
05-09-2020T14:34:03,CrRAR,"Okay, good to hear you’re at least on the mend"
05-09-2020T14:34:16,CrRAR,no fun that is
05-09-2020T14:35:44,Twokinds,"I'm going to do the stream to get all the votes, and do at least one sketch for tomorrow. But then that'll be it."
05-09-2020T14:36:02,Twokinds,"I'm very tired, sorry."
05-09-2020T14:36:51,Sammit,"Don't worry, everybody need to take care of themselves"
05-09-2020T14:37:05,Roughlandin,No worries! Better Tom means better arts!
05-09-2020T14:37:12,jirka,Hi Tom and I get it

05-09-2020T14:39:47,Roughlandin,Terra is either saying sleep is good... or they love you and they're going to sleep. I agree with both sentiments
05-09-2020T14:40:06,jirka,Hi Everyone
05-09-2020T14:40:13,Roughlandin,o/ Jirka
05-09-2020T14:40:27,jirka,Hi Roug

05-09-2020T14:41:13,Roughlandin,Lol. Night Terra!
05-09-2020T14:41:53,jirka,"Tom, you're not the only one who's not well"
05-09-2020T14:44:24,CrimsonHelsing,"Heard the news, Tom e3e we understand, me personally as well. Caught a stomach virus a few months ago, not fun. Hope you can recover soon, I know how much that sucks, being so tired and sore and all xP"
05-09-2020T14:45:57,Roughlandin,I've been there too. Never trust fast food oysters...
05-09-2020T14:46:33,johnnytho,oh jeez dude
05-09-2020T14:46:33,BadFoMo,"Same, I think."
05-09-2020T14:46:36,CrimsonHelsing,And drinking a whole pint of melted ice cream is like drinking spoiled milk (except it doesn't taste awful)
05-09-2020T14:47:23,Roughlandin,:ptv-grossedout:
05-09-2020T14:47:29,CrimsonHelsing,^^^
05-09-2020T14:49:20,Twokinds,"I felt great a few days before, and then suddenly, totally dabilitated. It's crazy how fast things can go south."
05-09-2020T14:49:35,CrimsonHelsing,Tell me about it -_-
05-09-2020T14:49:54,TeapotOfDoom,hey tom! heard you are at least a bit better today!
05-09-2020T14:50:00,TeapotOfDoom,all the best!
05-09-2020T14:51:45,Roughlandin,It's definitely no fun. My brother got food poisoning off melon from a hotal breakfast buffet... In the middle of a 1100 mile drive from Florida to home.
05-09-2020T14:52:58,CrimsonQuill,Evening all
05-09-2020T14:53:04,CrimsonQuill,"Hi Tom, hope you're okay"
05-09-2020T14:53:09,CrimsonQuill,Hi everyone else
05-09-2020T14:53:21,Roughlandin,o/ Quill
05-09-2020T14:53:24,CrimsonQuill,Is stream postponed tonight?
05-09-2020T14:53:35,CrimsonQuill,Is it tonight or later?
05-09-2020T14:53:37,Twokinds,Ugh. Food poisoning while travelling would be infinitely worse.
05-09-2020T14:53:48,Twokinds,It was bad enough for me when I had a bathroom within easy reach.
05-09-2020T14:53:53,CrimsonQuill,My sister got that...
05-09-2020T14:53:58,CrimsonQuill,It was not fun for her.
05-09-2020T14:54:07,Roughlandin,It's bad wherever you are lol
05-09-2020T14:54:24,CrimsonQuill,"How did it happen, actually?"
05-09-2020T14:54:31,CrimsonQuill,Do you know?
05-09-2020T14:55:05,Roughlandin,"Well, when a mommy E. coli and a daddy E. coli love each other very much..."
05-09-2020T14:55:27,CrRAR,"Yeah, when your whole body feels like it hates you, you don’t wanna be anywhere."
05-09-2020T14:55:28,CrimsonQuill,...
05-09-2020T14:55:37,Roughlandin,:ptv-condescending:
05-09-2020T14:55:46,Twokinds,No clue how it happened.
05-09-2020T14:55:51,Twokinds,I don't know what it was I ate.
05-09-2020T14:55:56,Twokinds,I can't remember.
05-09-2020T14:56:06,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,does your food hang low does it dangle to and fro?
05-09-2020T14:56:07,CrimsonQuill,Okay. That's understandable. I guess it can come out of the blue like that.
05-09-2020T14:56:16,CrRAR,"too traumatic, obviously"
05-09-2020T14:56:33,CrimsonQuill,"I work in a kitchen see, so we treat things like food poisoning very seriously"
05-09-2020T14:56:35,Roughlandin,When you puke so hard you get short term retrograde amnesia
05-09-2020T14:56:40,CrRAR,That’s probably how they got trace
05-09-2020T14:56:56,CrimsonQuill,XD
05-09-2020T14:57:03,CrimsonHelsing,"Anything really, even tainted food that looks and tastes fine when you get it. That's the scary part"
05-09-2020T14:57:26,CrimsonQuill,"Trace didn't forget everything by battling Neutral, he got sick after challenging her to an all-you-can-eat face off!#"
05-09-2020T14:57:27,CrimsonHelsing,Ofc people can sue over food poisoning xD
05-09-2020T14:57:29,Roughlandin,Thanks CrRAR. Now I can't stop imagining Neutral giving Trace the forget-me-barfs
05-09-2020T14:57:31,K3IDRAN,Young Keidran out w/ the Gs
05-09-2020T14:58:06,CrimsonQuill,@CrimsonHelsing We have strict rules over how long we can keep stuff before we throw it out in the kitchen.
05-09-2020T14:58:17,CrimsonHelsing,Smart
05-09-2020T14:58:38,CrimsonHelsing,Same with the diner and sandwich shop I work with (two jobs)
05-09-2020T14:58:44,CrimsonQuill,Even if something's frozen pr refrigerated it's tossed out after a cutoff time.
05-09-2020T14:58:54,CrRAR,lol
05-09-2020T14:59:00,CrimsonHelsing,Even better
05-09-2020T14:59:00,Roughlandin,We had the same when I used to work at Kroger. I survived a lot of lunch breaks on risky expired donuts...
05-09-2020T14:59:02,AspiringNoodle,"Fun fact, even coffee can't be up forever"
05-09-2020T14:59:03,tehbear,timebomb or food. choose 1
05-09-2020T14:59:06,K3IDRAN,Sup CrRAR
05-09-2020T14:59:07,CrimsonQuill,Doubly important since it's a nursing home. Can't take chances.

05-09-2020T14:59:21,AspiringNoodle,"Doesn't matter if its brewed near boiling, the holding temps for coffee are lower and can cause issues if you leave it for too long"

05-09-2020T14:59:44,Roughlandin,Never trust a strange masked figure holding mystery meats
05-09-2020T15:00:05,K3IDRAN,Agreed

05-09-2020T15:02:32,BadFoMo,I'm fine with that.

05-09-2020T15:06:55,Roughlandin,"Idk. Whenever Tom gets the tkpolls lists compiled, I guess"
05-09-2020T15:07:28,Roughlandin,Probably should wait for more people to show up so they can vote too

05-09-2020T15:13:55,BadFoMo,Go ahead. I think you only need to worry when a stream is on.

05-09-2020T15:32:13,CrimsonQuill,I think Tom checks them himself
05-09-2020T15:32:14,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Tom does that
05-09-2020T15:32:18,PalmettoPathfinder1,And summon a squadron of dragons to rain down destruction on the demon armies!
05-09-2020T15:32:18,ThingsAreMoving,FoMo we only need to clone Tom abour four or five times.
05-09-2020T15:32:23,ThingsAreMoving,about*
05-09-2020T15:32:27,Dimensional,Tom does that when he's not overworked. Sometimes something sneaks past
05-09-2020T15:32:50,ThingsAreMoving,And that's pretty neat Palm. I remember playing as half dragon in Neverwinter Nights.

05-09-2020T15:33:27,Roughlandin,Inb4 the TK EU gets to be like the old Star Wars EU. Trace and Flora's great grandson with tiger-striped purple hair fights a race of sentient plant people
05-09-2020T15:33:29,BaskervilleNQH,Now there's an idea.

05-09-2020T15:33:58,CrimsonQuill,"If they're good writers and artists, sure"
05-09-2020T15:33:59,CrRAR,you would get a promotion!
05-09-2020T15:33:59,Dimensional,I think it would be nice to see others do canon works for TK EU
05-09-2020T15:33:59,ThingsAreMoving,"I'd read that tbh, Tom."

05-09-2020T15:34:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,If they are SFW then it be cool to see what they think of
05-09-2020T15:34:12,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Or a Swarm that moves (basically your body becomes composed of worms, locusts, roaches etc and you get evil dark powers)"
05-09-2020T15:34:17,BaskervilleNQH,I think that would be neat. I've been jotting down some ideas in my spare time when I take breaks from my work writing.
05-09-2020T15:34:28,BadFoMo,"If they're in canon, sure."
05-09-2020T15:34:29,PalmettoPathfinder1,@ThingsAreMoving I just imagined Trace as a necromancer!
05-09-2020T15:34:30,Dadrobit,"The answer to that is a giant ""It Depends"""
05-09-2020T15:34:33,LogicIsHere,an expanded TK universe sounds like a grand old time
05-09-2020T15:34:45,ProsePro7,Like with expanded universe Lucas had total creative control.  Tom would have veto power on it.
05-09-2020T15:34:47,Twokinds,"Like, if I did the character designs, but someone else did the art to a side story. It wouldn't be my style exactly, but it'd be more TK stuff."

05-09-2020T15:35:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Could be fun

05-09-2020T15:35:12,AvisIgnis,"ye, lots of potential"
05-09-2020T15:35:17,ProsePro7,You cant do it all Tom.  Even Jack Kirby didnt do all the Marvel art.  Go for it.
05-09-2020T15:35:19,Dadrobit,Like an official third party outlet of TK canon content?
05-09-2020T15:35:22,CrimsonQuill,I have trouble imagining any of the Twokinds stuff as anything other than Tom's style

05-09-2020T15:35:42,Roughlandin,"Oh, hey! That new guy's suggestion won"
05-09-2020T15:35:42,CrimsonQuill,Which means I have trouble drawing Raine as a Halo spartan because that comic idea is kinda semi realistic
05-09-2020T15:35:43,Twokinds,"I can only do so much, so it's the only way we'll see some of these side comics made."

05-09-2020T15:37:44,ProsePro7,@Twokinds Tom what you could do is also outsource the background work and do the individual characters yourself.

05-09-2020T18:34:50,AspiringNoodle,I'm trying to imagine a society in such a world
05-09-2020T18:35:11,AspiringNoodle,So much of our official documentation for the government is more or less posed around the idea of many things being static
