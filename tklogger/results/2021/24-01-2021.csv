24-01-2021T19:44:05,CrimsonQuill,"If I may ask, CrRAR, What is it you use stuff like ARCmap for?"
24-01-2021T19:44:20,CrimsonQuill,You mentioned using it when I brought it up...I think
24-01-2021T19:44:29,CrimsonQuill,ArcGIS or Arcmap
24-01-2021T19:44:38,CrRAR,"I don't, but the town I worked for did"
24-01-2021T19:44:43,CrRAR,my last job
24-01-2021T19:44:46,CrimsonQuill,"Ah, I see"
24-01-2021T22:42:15,Ordithus,Verona is not Venice. It is also cool.
24-01-2021T22:42:23,AspiringNoodle,The one town he recommends has an electronics district
24-01-2021T22:42:33,AspiringNoodle,So many different stores where you can buy electronics new and old.
24-01-2021T22:42:45,CrRAR,"Let’s hope Balogna, Italy does not live up to its name"
24-01-2021T22:42:53,AspiringNoodle,"It's amazing, you can find old games console hardware on the cheap in near mint condition"
24-01-2021T22:42:53,CrRAR,:ptv-uneasy:
24-01-2021T22:43:24,AspiringNoodle,They take good care of their things.  So stuff that's 30+ years old still looks brand spanking new
24-01-2021T22:43:48,Ordithus,"Chioggia is discount Venice, but clean. And with a beach nearby"
24-01-2021T22:44:05,CrRAR,"Yeah I would imagine factory surplus would keep that stuff stocked for ages, noodle"
24-01-2021T22:44:12,AspiringNoodle,"But yeah, if you ever become a content creator and are able to live off it, Japan is an idyllic place to live"
24-01-2021T22:44:52,AspiringNoodle,You can travel by train to various places and get to explore the country
24-01-2021T22:45:05,CrRAR,Like even when the Delorean factory closed there were so many parts that’s where the hobbiest supplies stlll circulate from
24-01-2021T22:45:32,CrRAR,"well, what had been produced at time in closed"
24-01-2021T22:45:48,CrRAR,That was like northern Ireland
24-01-2021T22:45:51,CrRAR,tho
24-01-2021T22:46:06,AspiringNoodle,"Ohohoho, sweet summer child"
24-01-2021T22:46:11,AspiringNoodle,you think I'm referring to surplus
24-01-2021T22:46:17,AspiringNoodle,But I'm referring to used :upside_down:
24-01-2021T22:46:25,CrRAR,ah
24-01-2021T22:46:42,AspiringNoodle,The controllers were all in clear plastic bags with price-gun stickers
24-01-2021T22:46:58,CrRAR,cool
24-01-2021T22:47:53,AspiringNoodle,But yeah... all that food I see on his channel...
24-01-2021T22:47:58,AspiringNoodle,makes me wish America was... healthier...
24-01-2021T22:48:27,AspiringNoodle,"Frozen dinners?  It's most likely to be beef, followed by breaded / fried"
24-01-2021T22:49:09,AspiringNoodle,"Most restaurants use breaded chicken as the default, and grilled is not always an option, which sucks because I've come to prefer the flavor of grilled."
24-01-2021T22:49:21,AspiringNoodle,fast food*
24-01-2021T22:53:47,Ordithus,:ptv-uneasy: I hope the modern background isn't causing Tom trouble
24-01-2021T23:47:55,SpazztasticKiwi,quick
24-01-2021T23:48:01,SpazztasticKiwi,cotton or fleece robe
