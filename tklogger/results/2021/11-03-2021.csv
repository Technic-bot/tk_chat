11-03-2021T12:26:27,SpazztasticKiwi,how is there less calories in a coke coffee than a coke
11-03-2021T12:42:40,CrRAR,coffee is pretty low on calories
11-03-2021T12:42:46,CrRAR,maybe like tea
11-03-2021T12:43:00,CrRAR,"so, it's kinda like watering down coke"
11-03-2021T12:43:45,CrRAR,"1/2 coke, half water would be half the sugar!"

11-03-2021T13:23:45,CrRAR,you could use it to taunt Bagheera with its light flecks
11-03-2021T14:25:31,TerraTheWizard,was wondering why i was getting phantom clicks since updating windows today
11-03-2021T14:25:39,TerraTheWizard,it turned my track pad on again
11-03-2021T14:25:47,TerraTheWizard,this took me 4 hours to figure out
11-03-2021T14:25:56,TerraTheWizard,and it was really anoying
11-03-2021T14:26:35,TerraTheWizard,any time i was typing the context menu would pop up on the cursor

11-03-2021T15:38:28,Twokinds,Sorry
11-03-2021T15:38:32,CrimsonQuill086,'Tis fine Tom
11-03-2021T15:38:41,CrimsonQuill086,The trip down memory lane is a welcome surprise
11-03-2021T15:39:00,CrimsonQuill086,"As we say where I live, 'Sure t'will be grand.'"
11-03-2021T15:39:28,Twokinds,"Patreon is cracking down again. Now, any post containing unclothed characters regardless of context much be labeled adult and Patron Only."
11-03-2021T15:39:36,Twokinds,"So, I'm doing a lot of mirroring."
11-03-2021T15:39:55,CrimsonQuill086,Oh dear...
11-03-2021T15:40:14,AspiringNoodle,"Ah yes, good ol patreon..."
11-03-2021T15:40:45,AspiringNoodle,"One of these days they're going to ""enforce"" themselves out of business :/"
11-03-2021T15:41:19,Twokinds,Yeah. I've got a feeling. They better watch themselves. Twitter I've heard is making plans to impement something similiar.
11-03-2021T15:41:23,Twokinds,Not that I trust twitter any more
11-03-2021T15:41:37,Twokinds,But anyone can look and see what happened to Tumblr
11-03-2021T15:41:46,AspiringNoodle,It honestly feels like Patreon is going on a bigger and bigger power trip
11-03-2021T15:42:18,AspiringNoodle,"Some NSFW artists who switched to SubscribeStar claimed Patreon was effectively trying to claim ownership of their work, and dictate what they could and could not do off platform."
11-03-2021T15:42:29,Twokinds,Yeah I've heard that
11-03-2021T15:43:46,AspiringNoodle,*sigh* What is this world coming to? ;-;
11-03-2021T15:49:44,TerraTheWizard,it's mostly credit card companies dictating what you can do
11-03-2021T15:50:08,TerraTheWizard,"""oh you let *nudity* on your platform"" [removes support]"
11-03-2021T15:50:51,TerraTheWizard,that tumblr thing was such a mess but also hilarious from a laughing at corpos situation
11-03-2021T15:51:10,TerraTheWizard,verizon: buys tumblr for 1.2bn dollars
11-03-2021T15:51:18,TerraTheWizard,verizon: bans nsfw on tumblr
11-03-2021T15:51:30,TerraTheWizard,verizon: sells tumblr for 2m dollars
11-03-2021T15:51:39,TerraTheWizard,that's a 99.9% loss on investment
11-03-2021T15:51:49,TerraTheWizard,which is impressive
11-03-2021T15:52:31,AspiringNoodle,I'll say xD
11-03-2021T16:05:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I just got break what happened
11-03-2021T16:16:17,TerraTheWizard,not much
11-03-2021T16:16:21,TerraTheWizard,patreon are being doodoos
11-03-2021T16:16:29,SpazztasticKiwi,my mother came by to tell me that moments after I left Bagheera knocked a full pot of dirt

11-03-2021T17:56:14,Twokinds,"It was the end of the month, I pre-sketched it off-stream thinking you'd suggest it again, and then I'd just pull it out and be like ""Done!"" But then you changed your suggestion."
11-03-2021T17:56:34,Twokinds,"So then I just hung on to it, thinking maybe you'd get back to it."
11-03-2021T17:57:03,Twokinds,But you never did XD
11-03-2021T17:57:20,Twokinds,So I forgot about it

11-03-2021T21:20:23,SageSaga,Dragon/Catfolk wizard- being a dragon kinda makes anything a tank-
11-03-2021T21:20:32,BadFoMo,Oh.
11-03-2021T21:21:53,SageSaga,it was an OP epic campaign- the idea was to try and give them options to do anything and take advantage of it- let them use their imaginations a bit more and feel less restricted
11-03-2021T21:22:38,SageSaga,some of them somehow turned that into a whole new way to not do anything though- truly they are amazing at not being creative sometimes
11-03-2021T21:23:52,Ordithus,:fire:
11-03-2021T21:24:05,BadFoMo,Funny how few to no restrictions can do that.

11-03-2021T21:34:16,SageSaga,yeah but generally the consequences of messing up - make for a fun time - or a challenging time in D&D
11-03-2021T21:34:31,SageSaga,not doing anything leads to a boring time
11-03-2021T21:34:49,SageSaga,id rather someone make a bad choice in a D&D game than no choice at all
11-03-2021T21:34:54,ZRO4825,"Yeah, but if it's someone who overthinks things, trying to puzzle out the potential of any action is what causes that paralysis."

11-03-2021T21:38:10,SageSaga,thats not the issue with us - XD we have been weekly very consistently for over 6 years

11-03-2021T21:38:56,Ordithus,the most fun I've had with a character was for a one-off
11-03-2021T21:42:16,CrRAR,nothing to lose~
11-03-2021T21:42:51,Ordithus,he was also my most recent. maybe I'm just getting better at it
11-03-2021T21:43:05,Ordithus,badass dwarf is fun no matter what tho
11-03-2021T21:43:23,Ordithus,wielding a sword probably taller than him
11-03-2021T21:43:55,SageSaga,most of the games ive played as dwarves that i didnt run got cancelled permanently
11-03-2021T21:44:58,Ordithus,unfortunate
11-03-2021T21:45:59,SageSaga,like when i played a dwarf barbarian and i used a magical flute that called all the animals of the forest out to listen- and when the deer got close enough- most of you know what happened im sure

11-03-2021T23:03:40,AspiringNoodle,I had so much downtime tonight
11-03-2021T23:03:53,AspiringNoodle,Literally came home twice and sat around for like 15 - 20 minutes.
11-03-2021T23:04:15,AspiringNoodle,But I made $126.50 in 6 hours :snail:

11-03-2021T23:05:43,AspiringNoodle,"It'll be fun seeing how much money I *actually* make after gas, repairs, and taxes xD"
11-03-2021T23:06:00,ZRO4825,Get a hybrid. Spend pennies to the mile on gas. XD
11-03-2021T23:06:06,SageSaga,no uber either
11-03-2021T23:06:13,AspiringNoodle,Grubhub???
11-03-2021T23:06:30,ZRO4825,Probably all the ride-sharing stuff hasn't decided to descend upon his area yet.
11-03-2021T23:06:32,SageSaga,nope

11-03-2021T23:07:54,ZRO4825,That's for your own good. Pizza Hut has gone downhill. :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
11-03-2021T23:08:49,SageSaga,its a franchise- it can vary from place to place- and so long as i can stuff that greasey sausey cheesey bread down my throat im fine
11-03-2021T23:08:58,ZRO4825,lol
11-03-2021T23:09:17,AspiringNoodle,I can feel that.  Everyone loves joking about Arby's

11-03-2021T23:23:58,Dadrobit,"Wait, there are places where Arby's isn't amazing?"
11-03-2021T23:24:10,AspiringNoodle,Apparently
11-03-2021T23:24:15,Dadrobit,I fuckin love Arby's.
11-03-2021T23:24:22,AspiringNoodle,I can't think of any other reason for Arby's being *the* punching bag on a lot of sitcoms
11-03-2021T23:24:43,Dadrobit,"Oh, sitcoms. That explains it."
11-03-2021T23:24:46,AspiringNoodle,"""Quick, we need to make fun of a fast food chain in this episode, which one?!"""
11-03-2021T23:24:50,AspiringNoodle,"""Arby's?"""
11-03-2021T23:24:55,AspiringNoodle,"Whole group: ""Arby's."""
11-03-2021T23:25:24,Ordithus,they are everywhere and aren't as obvious a target as mcd's or bk
11-03-2021T23:25:35,Dadrobit,"I've never watched a sitcom outside of like.... Soap, and that's from the 80's-90's."
11-03-2021T23:26:07,Dadrobit,"Nvm, 70's."
11-03-2021T23:29:26,Ordithus,I am loving her design!
11-03-2021T23:30:09,CrRAR,very reverent
11-03-2021T23:30:14,CrRAR,much poise
11-03-2021T23:30:17,CrRAR,wow
11-03-2021T23:33:29,ZRO4825,"I do not recognize her, but I'd like to cuddle her, and brush her tail."
11-03-2021T23:34:13,Ordithus,at least offer her tea first
11-03-2021T23:34:38,ZRO4825,MH: Rise Demo go!
11-03-2021T23:35:26,Ordithus,look forward to seeing her
11-03-2021T23:35:41,CrRAR,cute!
11-03-2021T23:36:00,ZRO4825,I like her. She's adorable. ^_^
11-03-2021T23:38:26,SageSaga,shes not far away now- the current chapter is almost up
11-03-2021T23:38:55,SageSaga,so many monsters i gotta draw for next chapter
11-03-2021T23:39:03,Mihari,I sense ZRO's death
11-03-2021T23:39:06,SageSaga,XD
11-03-2021T23:39:09,Ordithus,haha
11-03-2021T23:40:53,ZRO4825,Let's be real. I'd have died years ago probably in Yosh just from trying to hug an android lady. :P
11-03-2021T23:41:25,SageSaga,it is kinda weird to randomly hug a woman in general
11-03-2021T23:41:49,SageSaga,i suppose i should say a stranger
11-03-2021T23:41:49,ZRO4825,"Well, I mean, I wouldn't do it IRL without permission, but it's funny in anime and stuff. :P"
11-03-2021T23:43:27,SageSaga,"i get its not RL but i really hate it when people are like ""What would happen if i tried to give Kate catnip! Hahaha!"""
11-03-2021T23:43:41,SageSaga,my answer would be youd go to jail for trying to drug someone
11-03-2021T23:43:58,Ordithus,hugging lien without permission would meet swift justice
11-03-2021T23:44:11,SageSaga,i dunno Ord
11-03-2021T23:44:25,Dadrobit,"Ngl, that was a huge portion of why I really didn't like Your Name."
11-03-2021T23:44:29,SageSaga,Lien doesnt really respond adversely to most things unless they are a threat
11-03-2021T23:44:33,ZRO4825,"I see Lien as more of a ""Excuse me wtf r u doing?"" response, lol"
11-03-2021T23:45:25,Dadrobit,"I get it, the first time the guy wakes up in a lady's body, going and fondling himself is funny. But after that? When she has made it expressly clear that she doesn't want that? Super fucked tbh."
11-03-2021T23:45:45,SageSaga,i will defend Your Name in that they didnt have a choice- nor did he remember doing it- their memories faded
11-03-2021T23:46:18,SageSaga,it was also a freak situation where like - its possible they might swap and be that way forever-
11-03-2021T23:46:56,Dadrobit,"Nah, he even had a moment where he considered honoring her wishes and not doing it, then he does it anyways and is caught by the little sister."
11-03-2021T23:46:57,SageSaga,though i do think they probably should have had her admit to kinda doing the same thing with him to make it more fair
11-03-2021T23:51:07,SageSaga,they were both seriously messing with each others lives though- what he did- while not socially acceptable - didnt actually hurt anyone or their situation- while she spent a ton of his money and possibly did the same thing - just wasnt shown because in
11-03-2021T23:51:32,SageSaga,japan - its very female centered on stuff like that
11-03-2021T23:52:00,Dadrobit,The whole movie was fucked sideways.
11-03-2021T23:52:38,Dadrobit,I think it's legitimately at the bottom of my list off all the anime movies I've watched.
11-03-2021T23:52:48,SpazztasticKiwi,even if it wasn’t as impactful it doesn’t mean such actions are dismissible
11-03-2021T23:52:53,SageSaga,and its close to the top of mine XD
11-03-2021T23:53:38,SageSaga,Ok lets say you swapped bodies with someone- but it wasnt temporary- you could never go back- are you saying its immoral to do anything with that body now?
11-03-2021T23:53:55,ZRO4825,"I mean, if you can't swap back...that's YOUR body now."
11-03-2021T23:54:01,Dadrobit,That wasn't the case though.
11-03-2021T23:54:06,SpazztasticKiwi,in a way yes by the fact it’s still not technically yours
11-03-2021T23:54:08,SageSaga,they had no idea what was going on
11-03-2021T23:54:18,SpazztasticKiwi,doesn’t make it ok
11-03-2021T23:54:30,Ordithus,awkward as heck
11-03-2021T23:54:50,SpazztasticKiwi,if it hits you you’re in someone else’s body it doesn’t mean you go ham with it
11-03-2021T23:55:03,Dadrobit,"On the first few times they didn't, sure, but it happened over and over again to the point that they had a semi-functional speaking relationship with texting each other."
11-03-2021T23:55:30,TheSexyBeast,o/
11-03-2021T23:55:31,SageSaga,again- they lost memories about it all every time- im not even sure if that line was correct in the original translation
11-03-2021T23:55:41,CrRAR,sexy!
11-03-2021T23:55:42,Ordithus,hi sexy
11-03-2021T23:55:47,CrRAR,:ccrrar-fnchwuf: hey sexy
11-03-2021T23:55:54,Dadrobit,o/
11-03-2021T23:55:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"if it happens & you can’t swap back, you need to look into therapy so you can work out how this will effect you as individuals and together, granted the two ever meet"
11-03-2021T23:56:27,SpazztasticKiwi,at least I would
11-03-2021T23:57:16,SageSaga,not sure how thats a therapy- if i swapped bodies with someone and they said i had to do whatever they said from now on- i'd tell em to screw off- thats my body now- i didnt have a choice- and im not going to force someone to do what i want with a body
11-03-2021T23:57:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"suddenly becoming male would throw me into all sorts of crisis, let alone finding out some guy has my body"
11-03-2021T23:57:20,SageSaga,i have no control over anymore
11-03-2021T23:57:24,Dadrobit,"The memories didn't completely fade until after the disaster. Like I mentioned before, the guy was 100% conscious that she didn't want him fondling her and he still went through with it."
11-03-2021T23:57:46,SageSaga,the memories faded every time they left the bodies
11-03-2021T23:57:50,SageSaga,every time
11-03-2021T23:57:59,SageSaga,that was explicit in the story
11-03-2021T23:58:10,Dadrobit,You and I are watching two different movies then.
11-03-2021T23:58:19,SageSaga,ive watched it like 6 times
11-03-2021T23:58:31,SageSaga,and again- that line i dont know if it was translated correctly
11-03-2021T23:58:33,TheSexyBeast,"Hello, my name is The Sexy Beast, and I used to give people hugs out of nowhere because I wasn't taught that it was impolite. That was when I was much younger than now."
11-03-2021T23:58:47,SageSaga,it probably was- but thats anime
11-03-2021T23:59:30,SageSaga,the whole point of the notebooks and phone messages was to keep track of it
11-03-2021T23:59:39,SageSaga,because they would forget it like a dream
11-03-2021T23:59:40,TheSexyBeast,"Wow, chat killer is me."
