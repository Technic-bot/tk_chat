28-01-2021T20:56:42,AspiringNoodle,"Iirc, ""The customer is always right"" was originally tied to giving the customer what they wanted"
28-01-2021T20:57:02,AspiringNoodle,"Like, maybe they wanted something done a specific way, something that was well within reason"
28-01-2021T20:57:47,AspiringNoodle,"But over time it seems to have mutated into this undeserved sense of entitlement, where the customer is NEVER wrong, and if you are unwilling, or unable, to do what they ask, then YOU are in the wrong"

28-01-2021T21:11:16,BadFoMo,@SageSaga I must have missed something. Why were you tracing the panels?
28-01-2021T21:13:06,SageSaga,NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS! ITS NOT LIKE I ACCIDENTALLY PUT THEM ON A RASTER LAYER INSTEAD OF A VECTOR LAYER OR SOMETHING!
28-01-2021T21:13:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Me thinks he did a thing
28-01-2021T21:13:39,Ordithus,ow my eye ears such yelling I see
28-01-2021T21:13:42,SageSaga,:P
28-01-2021T21:13:51,BadFoMo,"I have no idea what that means, but ok."
28-01-2021T21:14:07,ZRO4825,"I do, lol"
28-01-2021T21:14:09,Ordithus,it means instead of drawing it he drew it
28-01-2021T21:14:24,SageSaga,raster layers are layers that use pixels and vector layers use- MATH!
28-01-2021T21:14:37,SageSaga,here- i shall show you!
28-01-2021T21:14:41,BadFoMo,"Ah, now I get it."
28-01-2021T21:14:46,BadFoMo,Thanks.
28-01-2021T21:14:55,Ordithus,infinite scaling :csagesaga-kaylinheart:
28-01-2021T21:15:22,SageSaga,here we have 2 stick people- one is named Vec and one is named Rast
28-01-2021T21:16:05,BadFoMo,Yay! I actually took something away from my PhotoShop classes!
28-01-2021T21:16:19,SageSaga,oh no! Rast took the wrong meds and now hes freakn huge and blury!
28-01-2021T21:16:41,SageSaga,Vec doesnt like being left out so he takes the same meds
28-01-2021T21:16:59,BadFoMo,...The same wrong meds?
28-01-2021T21:17:15,SageSaga,yep- now hes huge too but hes not all blurry and junk!
28-01-2021T21:17:21,Ordithus,Sage this is the finest art ever
28-01-2021T21:17:46,SageSaga,its because Vec is made of stronger stuff- MATH
28-01-2021T21:17:56,SageSaga,while Ras is weak and make of tiny blocks
28-01-2021T21:18:21,ZapiliDver,"Damn, my coworker one day bring me floorplan in raster (he made it in Photoshop and export to jpeg). He is a very lucky, that flying hard drive missed his head."
28-01-2021T21:18:22,SageSaga,and thats the story about how Ras turned to a life of crime
28-01-2021T21:18:37,SageSaga,forever wishing he could be more like his old friend Vec
28-01-2021T21:18:38,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
28-01-2021T21:18:52,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:
28-01-2021T21:19:23,SageSaga,and thats how i lost my job as a teacher
28-01-2021T21:19:27,BadFoMo,...Inb4 we get Ras and Vec requests?
28-01-2021T21:20:50,BadFoMo,"@SageSaga Well, anyway, thanks for the explaion."
28-01-2021T21:21:03,SageSaga,anytime*
28-01-2021T21:21:51,MoonDance,Is CSP resolution dependent?
28-01-2021T21:22:55,SageSaga,isnt everything?
28-01-2021T21:23:33,MoonDance,Adobe illustrator is independent since it does the fancy kwisp math on it's own
28-01-2021T21:23:54,MoonDance,but that's the only software I know that is
28-01-2021T21:24:50,SageSaga,there's inherent limitations on all graphical software because some things get so big so quickly 64bit systems cant handle them
28-01-2021T21:25:01,CrRAR,illustrator is a trippy piece of software
28-01-2021T21:25:21,CrRAR,It has it’s uses but it kinda hs an identity crisis going
28-01-2021T21:26:01,MoonDance,It's honestly not as bad as it looks. Like yes you want to strangle your computer neighbor in frustration but illustrator is pretty nice
28-01-2021T21:26:03,CrRAR,Like it’s not sure to be grapic design or for purely for art
28-01-2021T21:26:08,MoonDance,"I do see your point there, Sage"
28-01-2021T21:26:24,CrRAR,Yeah it’s not bad at all

28-01-2021T21:41:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean not without dinner first but maybe
28-01-2021T21:41:23,SageSaga,"i hate having to pay quarterly on what i ""expect"" to owe though"
28-01-2021T21:41:38,Tharkis,"thankfully my federal taxes are really easy, i still have to file for 2 states though, living on the border my home is in one state but i work in the other"
28-01-2021T21:41:40,SageSaga,because holy crap my income is not easy to guess what i owe

28-01-2021T23:52:22,Zakuru,My mom has fasted a lot
28-01-2021T23:52:23,Tamerlee,Fasting is pretty normal. Your body switches from running on glucose to running on fat.
28-01-2021T23:52:27,SpazztasticKiwi,people still in developmental age groups shouldn’t try it
28-01-2021T23:52:28,MoonDance,It's what Muslims do for rah madam
28-01-2021T23:52:32,Tamerlee,Just feels like crap the first time it happens.
28-01-2021T23:52:37,unsteddyphoenix,fasting is just diets with less steps
28-01-2021T23:52:45,ThingsAreMoving,"I plan on fasting two days every other week. Did a test run last month to check how I'd feel, went 74 hours without any food, just lightly salted water. Honestly after first 20ish hours it felt pretty okay"
28-01-2021T23:53:06,Tamerlee,"yeah, you stop feeling hungry"
28-01-2021T23:53:25,ThingsAreMoving,"But my body temp dropped very low, like 35.1 C"
28-01-2021T23:53:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I should lose some but I’m pretty sure what I got isn’t going anywhere cause I’ve tried plenty of things
28-01-2021T23:53:37,MoonDance,You basically don't eat in a cetain period of time of the day. But you shouldn't over do or you become malnourish

28-01-2021T23:54:01,Tamerlee,Keto/fasting is the only thing that has worked for me.

28-01-2021T23:54:18,ThingsAreMoving,I call bs on that
28-01-2021T23:54:26,MoonDance,I like Keto- only problem I can't have cheese at all
28-01-2021T23:54:26,Tamerlee,That's dangerous
28-01-2021T23:54:36,Tamerlee,"You can have cheese on keto, lol"
28-01-2021T23:54:39,unsteddyphoenix,"The only time I ever fasted was for charity, and I got suuuper sick lol"
28-01-2021T23:54:56,unsteddyphoenix,But I was probably borderline underweight back then
28-01-2021T23:55:00,Tamerlee,"I don't like cheese, though. So I eat other stuff."
28-01-2021T23:55:04,MoonDance,Ramadam is about 30 days of fasting so it's not that bs
28-01-2021T23:55:20,ThingsAreMoving,"Yeah, but it's only fasting from sunrise til sunset"
28-01-2021T23:55:32,ThingsAreMoving,not 24/7 for 30 days
28-01-2021T23:55:36,MoonDance,Wait did they fast at night too?
