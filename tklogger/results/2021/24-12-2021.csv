24-12-2021T00:04:38,Warmermold91,Maybe it's translated from another language and is getting broken by the translation
24-12-2021T00:05:39,GrandmasterPotato,ANYONE open towards drawing a request though? 
24-12-2021T00:05:55,BadFoMo,I mean he got this message 'word for word'. I think this is a bot.

24-12-2021T00:06:25,Warmermold91,Answer truthfully

24-12-2021T00:17:22,Rosscoe,"I'm off today but I go back to work tomorrow night, just staying up all morning till I go sleep the day away and sync up for another back shift :("

24-12-2021T00:19:54,Dadrobit,Tonight is starting off on a sour note. Why do people have to be dicks?
24-12-2021T00:20:22,Rosscoe,Hoi Robit!
24-12-2021T00:20:23,KeefMcDerpface,hello Dad
24-12-2021T00:20:31,BadFoMo,Yo.
24-12-2021T00:20:39,Dadrobit,I went out and got my crew a bunch of White Castle and drinks and doughnuts and stuff for tonight.
24-12-2021T00:20:40,Rosscoe,"They just are Robit, they just are :("
24-12-2021T00:21:33,Dadrobit,"One of my guys got the night out. It's being filled by a day shift supervisor, and they DO NOT like that I'm getting my guys food and drinks."
24-12-2021T00:22:15,Dadrobit,Because it's unfair to the day shift folks who won't get anything.
24-12-2021T00:22:54,Rosscoe,What a sour puss
24-12-2021T00:23:13,Dadrobit,"This lady is less than a week old at this site, and is really not starting off on a strong note with me."
24-12-2021T00:24:27,Rosscoe,"As the saying goes, ""welcome to back shifts, where we clean up after day shift and its always back shifts fault"""
24-12-2021T00:25:20,Dadrobit,"""I WILL be reporting you to (Account Manager) Lieutenant Dadrobit!"" Fucking go ahead, please, I'd love to have that chat."
24-12-2021T00:26:40,Dadrobit,"Anyways, my other guy on tonight made the deliveries,.and the drama has left the building. How's your night been, Sage?"

24-12-2021T00:28:36,SageSaga,i had to wake up early each day to take care of a pair of dogs
24-12-2021T00:28:42,SageSaga,those dogs do not like me
24-12-2021T00:29:07,Dadrobit,"Haven't seen my bro and his family in like 5 years, so I gotta go out for em and do things"
24-12-2021T00:29:18,SageSaga,and when the realized mommy and daddy arent coming home and they just have me to look out for them-

24-12-2021T00:55:15,Dadrobit,"Director was open about changing things in the story to include more of Yen and Triss. Seems folks were freaking out fearing that a ""woman empowerment"" director was gonna ruin it by detracting too much from Geralt."
24-12-2021T00:57:32,Dadrobit,"Bit like I said, I'm 3 episodes in, and it seems totally fine for me. Was asking to see if anyone else had similar/opposed opinions on it."

24-12-2021T15:04:55,Sammit,Hi Hogan
24-12-2021T15:05:09,Hogan,Hello Sammit! :-)
24-12-2021T15:11:35,ZapiliDver,"Hi FoMo, Hogan"
24-12-2021T15:11:52,Hogan,Hiay Zapili!
24-12-2021T15:15:56,SageSaga,so - i dont know how many of you know this - but do you know the right way for the top of an outfit like this overlaps?
24-12-2021T15:17:32,Hogan,I am afraid my knowledge in the fine arts of dressing come up short there...
24-12-2021T15:18:05,BadFoMo,Uh... Maybe? ...Or how else is it supposed to be worn?
24-12-2021T15:18:32,SageSaga,this is the correct way
24-12-2021T15:19:04,BadFoMo,With the left side on top of the right?
24-12-2021T15:19:31,SageSaga,but- funny story- when you dress a corpse - you do it the opposite way
24-12-2021T15:19:50,SageSaga,so if you reverse it- it's like saying they are dead-
24-12-2021T15:20:00,Hogan,"Ah, makes sense... makes it easier to recognize an undead!"
24-12-2021T15:20:20,SageSaga,i made this mistake once when looking for a reference - and it turned out the character was a ghost
24-12-2021T15:20:35,Hogan,"""The count dresses opposite, hurry, check if he got a reflection!"""

24-12-2021T15:29:12,SageSaga,i wonder if theres some gothic japanese poem about looking at the dead me in the mirror-

24-12-2021T18:08:46,Dadrobit,"Just sitting by the pond at grandma's house, chilling while about 147 children run amok at the house. Too much family."

24-12-2021T18:10:47,Dadrobit,I legit do not know half of the people at this party. 
24-12-2021T18:11:01,ZapiliDver,Hi Dadro! 147 childrens - sounds like a nightmare for me.
24-12-2021T18:11:14,Mediawatcher37,I would not be able to handle that
24-12-2021T18:12:00,Dadrobit,Nieces/nephews/extended family/vaguely associated friends and their family. 
24-12-2021T18:12:06,Warmermold91,How many presents where their
24-12-2021T18:12:07,Dadrobit,Way too many people.
24-12-2021T18:12:37,Mediawatcher37,Some of the gifts we gave each other last night for secret Santa were interesting
24-12-2021T18:12:52,Mediawatcher37,I got a cigar
24-12-2021T18:13:03,Dadrobit,"Dunno, presents are locked in another room at the moment. Got my dad a new toolbox and a bunch of tools."
24-12-2021T18:13:08,SageSaga,"i swear every time i write broccoli auto correct is like ""nope, you put 2 Ls and its 2 C's "" and then i put 2 C's and its like ""Nope- two L's"" and i use auto fix and its like - BROCCOLI"
24-12-2021T18:14:34,Dadrobit,"Broccoli, the other banana."
24-12-2021T18:15:11,Mediawatcher37,Auto correct is a bitch
24-12-2021T18:15:19,Dadrobit,https://imgur.com/a/kBxe4uE the fish are good company at least.
24-12-2021T18:15:22,SageSaga,"""why do you want to Ban Anna?"
24-12-2021T18:16:03,Dadrobit,Because her kids are too damned rowdy
24-12-2021T18:16:05,SageSaga,Robit! im gonna let that slide cuz its CHRISTMAS
24-12-2021T18:16:24,Dadrobit,MERRY CHRISTMAS!
24-12-2021T18:16:36,Warmermold91,MERRY CHRISTMAS!
24-12-2021T18:16:57,Dadrobit,"Anna is my sister in law, no lie. "
24-12-2021T18:17:11,Dadrobit,She's the one taking all the pictures
24-12-2021T18:17:46,SageSaga,i have 2 of the most cliche backwater country names for 2 of my aunts
24-12-2021T18:18:13,SageSaga,"i have an AUNT BETSY, and an AUNT MINDA"
24-12-2021T18:18:18,Dadrobit,Darcine and Mereditha?
24-12-2021T18:18:35,Dadrobit,"Mindy, I was close"
24-12-2021T18:19:08,SageSaga,and my other aunt is a Kathy XD
24-12-2021T18:19:25,SageSaga,who went to college with 15 other Kathys=
24-12-2021T18:19:48,Warmermold91,An army of Kathy's
24-12-2021T18:19:53,Mediawatcher37,That’s a lot of kathys
24-12-2021T18:19:59,Mediawatcher37,Kathys everywhere
24-12-2021T18:20:25,Warmermold91,I can't imagine group projects
24-12-2021T18:20:37,Mediawatcher37,Hey kathy
24-12-2021T18:21:58,Dadrobit,"That's where nicknames come in. Had one class with 4 Dadrobit's including the teacher. I was ""Big D"" for that class."
24-12-2021T18:22:21,SageSaga,and one of them was her roommate- and she had the last name of her mothers maiden name- which everyone knew because- prominent family at the time - so everyone thought  they were cousins-
24-12-2021T18:22:50,SageSaga,but my aunt said- her room looked like the ghost from the ring- while she was blonde with short hair and blue eyes-
24-12-2021T18:23:02,SageSaga,so they looked nothing alike-
24-12-2021T18:24:00,SageSaga,"but i was still like ""wait- what's it like rooming   with Sadako from the Ring?"" and she was like ""Shes actually pretty friendly once you get to know her"""
24-12-2021T18:30:06,Dadrobit,"Ok, time to head in and be sociable while all the kiddos open presents. Have a good one y'all, hope to see y'all later!"
24-12-2021T18:30:26,SageSaga,good luck!

24-12-2021T20:03:30,Twokinds,Haha! That's great! :D
24-12-2021T20:03:39,Twokinds,Very in character.
24-12-2021T20:05:17,SageSaga,do you like Trace's character name?
24-12-2021T20:06:19,Twokinds,It took me a minute
24-12-2021T20:06:49,SageSaga,i was kinda proud of that one XD
24-12-2021T20:11:13,SageSaga,"reminds me of a skit about people playing dnd- but the DM keeps putting his sexual fantasies in the story - and the female character gets caught in a trap and hes like ""As the smoke clears you are now a catwoman- that looks just like Cheetarah from -"
24-12-2021T20:11:21,SageSaga,"Thundercats! But with bigger tits!"""
24-12-2021T20:12:41,SageSaga,"""OK! Im done with this game and your creepy fetish stuff!"" ""W-What fetish stuff!?"" ""Remember the one where you had us all stripped naked and put in bondage together?"" ""That was a team building scenario!"""
24-12-2021T20:13:38,Twokinds,XD
24-12-2021T20:13:52,Warmermold91,0_o
24-12-2021T20:14:30,microbuss,Cheetarah as Catwoman! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
24-12-2021T20:14:35,AspiringNoodle,pfffft
24-12-2021T20:14:48,microbuss,Batgirl? hehe
24-12-2021T20:20:12,microbuss,I wish it'd SNOW! grrrr
24-12-2021T20:21:30,SageSaga,dont waste a wish on such a thing
24-12-2021T20:26:18,SageSaga,"if you want it to snow  so badly- make your wish something like the power to control the weather- then you can profit from your wish instead of telling people ""hey- remember that time it snowed on christmas here? i made that happen"""
24-12-2021T20:29:25,JeremySenpai,:ptv-shock: what if it comes with a curse sage. 
24-12-2021T20:30:03,SageSaga,depends on the curse- some curses can be used 
24-12-2021T20:30:09,JeremySenpai,changes the whole world weather p[patterns and destroys the planets eco sysytems 
24-12-2021T20:32:29,SageSaga,from using it once?
24-12-2021T20:32:56,Twokinds,Isn't that beyond the scope of a wish
24-12-2021T20:33:21,SageSaga,in dnd terms that leaves it up to the dm what happens
24-12-2021T20:33:46,SageSaga,but- a wish can replicate the control weather spell and make it snow
24-12-2021T20:33:53,SageSaga,no problem
24-12-2021T20:34:14,Twokinds,"Wish only lets you cast a spell once, though."
24-12-2021T20:35:12,microbuss,a curse would be The Blizzard of 1949 hehe
24-12-2021T20:35:26,SageSaga,yeah so you would have to wish for the ability to cast it daily - which i think you could do- but it would possibly end with a monkeys paw effect or it would lead to something else- and you might never be able to wish again
24-12-2021T20:36:03,microbuss,all the storms that hit California are dumping snow in feet in the Rockies
24-12-2021T20:36:07,Twokinds,Mmmhm
24-12-2021T20:36:11,Twokinds,Would be interesting
24-12-2021T20:36:24,SageSaga,but- if you are in a position where you can actually cast wish- then you could just wish and control the weather whenever-
24-12-2021T20:37:05,SageSaga,hmm- would it be fair to wish for the ability to cast a spell of 8th level or lower at a time of your choosing in the future?
24-12-2021T20:37:16,microbuss,well I wish for a mountain of money too but that not gonna happen 
24-12-2021T20:37:57,microbuss,either
24-12-2021T20:38:17,SageSaga,bad wish 
24-12-2021T20:38:35,SageSaga,a mountain of money could end up just being a million pennies 
24-12-2021T20:38:44,Warmermold91,Oof
24-12-2021T20:39:03,KeefMcDerpface,so many pennies...
24-12-2021T20:39:29,Warmermold91,Hello keef.
24-12-2021T20:39:42,microbuss,yay pennies!
24-12-2021T20:40:01,SageSaga,sure- its 10k USD- but who the heck wants that many pennies?
24-12-2021T20:40:10,microbuss,yes
24-12-2021T20:40:20,SageSaga,that would be 5500lbs!
24-12-2021T20:40:27,Warmermold91,👀
24-12-2021T20:40:32,microbuss,I :heart: finding pennies
24-12-2021T20:40:54,Warmermold91,You'll find a lot of pennies
24-12-2021T20:41:20,Twokinds,No it'd be about 7500 pounds
24-12-2021T20:41:36,microbuss,thats why I check the CoinStar reject place hehe
24-12-2021T20:41:53,microbuss,do NOT use one!
24-12-2021T20:42:18,SageSaga,well - im done! gnight folks! take care! Merry Christmas!- and I googled the penny thing- it said 5511 lbs
24-12-2021T20:42:23,microbuss,go to your bank & exchange loose change for monies

24-12-2021T20:45:01,iliar,"You know. Jokes about Nora x Trace are funny at first. Then I thought that it’s a little sad, when your only love interest always keeps you in the friend zone."
24-12-2021T20:45:13,Warmermold91,Oof
24-12-2021T20:52:29,Twokinds,Nora has nothing but time. She'll always have options.
24-12-2021T20:54:06,Sammit,Thanks for the stream Sage and Merry Christmas everyone
24-12-2021T20:58:23,iliar,"Actually, yes, Trace is clearly not her first love. And obviously not the last one (considering how short humans lives). But it's still a little sad."
24-12-2021T21:07:11,iliar,"I think it's a good idea to balance these jokes with stories of better relationships. For example, this guy looks like a good candidate."

24-12-2021T22:49:09,Twokinds,I'm just inking everything for tomorrow. Although I just now realize I'm not going to be able to stream at my normal time.
24-12-2021T22:49:39,Twokinds,"I have another Christmas get-together to go to. I'll have to stream later, probably around 8-9."
24-12-2021T22:50:45,Dadrobit,All good. Fam comes first. Holidays only only come around a few times a year. You knock work like this out every month. 
24-12-2021T22:51:03,Dadrobit,The planet will continue to rotate regardless of the time you start streaming :D
