20-01-2021T13:46:49,CrimsonQuill,Hello again all!
20-01-2021T13:46:55,CrimsonQuill,I have finished Subnautica today!
20-01-2021T13:47:13,CrimsonQuill,"I got on at about 8-9am, and kept going straight through till 2pm..."
20-01-2021T13:47:57,CrimsonQuill,It was one of those days when I was so close to the end of the game that I couldn't really stop....but it was so good to go through!
20-01-2021T13:48:48,CrimsonQuill,"Well done on the new Tablet pen, Tom. I look forward through the new page!"
20-01-2021T13:52:59,Twokinds,Congrats!
20-01-2021T13:53:07,Twokinds,Hope you enjoyed it. I liked Subnautica a lot.
20-01-2021T13:53:13,CrimsonQuill,You bet I did!
20-01-2021T13:53:23,Roughlandin,Grats Crim!
20-01-2021T13:53:27,CrimsonQuill,It was a tremendous journey! I scanned a Reaper!
20-01-2021T13:53:57,CrimsonQuill,I also Leeroy Jenkinsed the Dragon outside of [REDACTED] because he was trying to eat Papyrus the Prawn Suit
20-01-2021T13:54:35,CrimsonQuill,"Edinmire (Seamoth), Christopher (Cyclops) and Papyrus (Nyeh heh heh) all watched me go."
20-01-2021T13:54:55,CrimsonQuill,It was nice to actually sit down and enjoy it.
20-01-2021T13:54:59,CrimsonQuill,:DDD
20-01-2021T13:55:04,CrimsonQuill,"Okay, gush over, sorry"

20-01-2021T13:56:49,SpazztasticKiwi,this poor man
20-01-2021T13:57:28,SpazztasticKiwi,he waited for this table of girls & one left her number
20-01-2021T13:57:39,CrimsonQuill,???
20-01-2021T13:57:43,CrimsonQuill,What happened next?
20-01-2021T13:58:00,Twokinds,oh... no?
20-01-2021T13:58:06,SpazztasticKiwi,he‚Äôs been texting her for awhile thinking ‚Äúyay new friend!‚Äù & she asked him out to the movies
20-01-2021T13:58:19,Roughlandin,But... dey closed?
20-01-2021T13:58:21,SpazztasticKiwi,it just hit hit that she asked him on a date
20-01-2021T13:58:24,SpazztasticKiwi,he‚Äôs gay
20-01-2021T13:58:28,CrimsonQuill,Oh.
20-01-2021T13:58:29,Roughlandin,Ohhhhh
20-01-2021T13:58:31,CrimsonQuill,Oh dear.
20-01-2021T13:58:34,NinoGD,oh
20-01-2021T13:58:42,CrimsonQuill,That'll put a damper on the fire...
20-01-2021T13:58:58,Twokinds,oh dear
20-01-2021T13:59:04,Roughlandin,Tell him to text her back and ask if he can bring his boyfriend
20-01-2021T13:59:25,SpazztasticKiwi,he says he feels bad because he‚Äôs gonna hurt her feelings
20-01-2021T13:59:42,Twokinds,"Eh naah, I'm sure she'll understand."
20-01-2021T13:59:56,Roughlandin,Yeah easy enough misunderstanding
20-01-2021T14:00:00,Twokinds,"""Sorry I have a boyfriend"" XD"
20-01-2021T14:00:06,Roughlandin,lol
20-01-2021T14:00:09,SpazztasticKiwi,she definitely will - I had a guy friend I liked who‚Äôs gay
20-01-2021T14:00:42,SpazztasticKiwi,bless his wee lil heart
20-01-2021T14:01:03,Roughlandin,My little brother's gay and he was like the most popular guy in high school. All the girls wanted to go out with him lol
20-01-2021T14:01:21,TerraTheWizard,oop
20-01-2021T14:01:22,TerraTheWizard,lol
20-01-2021T14:02:10,Roughlandin,Yeaaaaah. It was kinda awkward being a senior and your junior brother was the most popular guy in the senior class lol
20-01-2021T14:03:12,CrimsonQuill,Welp
20-01-2021T14:03:23,SpazztasticKiwi,his solution? find a subtle way of letting her know he‚Äôs gay before they go
20-01-2021T14:04:01,Roughlandin,I still say ask her if he can bring his boyfriend lol
20-01-2021T14:04:03,SpazztasticKiwi,could also go and comment that the popcorn guy is hot
20-01-2021T14:04:39,Roughlandin,Eh. I think getting everything out in the open before the big day would be best
20-01-2021T14:04:45,SpazztasticKiwi,he made no mention of a boyfriend - he may not have one at the moment
20-01-2021T14:05:22,Roughlandin,"Then just ""Hey, I'm gay but I still really like movies if you still want to go!"""
20-01-2021T14:05:33,Roughlandin,Simple. Friendly. Honest.
20-01-2021T14:07:57,SpazztasticKiwi,next girl bought a pair of rainbow sunglasses
20-01-2021T14:08:06,SpazztasticKiwi,she says they‚Äôre her gayviators
20-01-2021T14:08:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I laughed harder than necessary
20-01-2021T14:11:34,Roughlandin,"Hmmm... Would a sketch of Modern Nat and Keith celebrating PRIDE violate your ""no real world stuff"" rule, Tom?"
20-01-2021T14:12:31,Roughlandin,...I don't know why I capitolized the whole word.
20-01-2021T14:13:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm surprised he was paying attention to see what I said - I‚Äôd figure it‚Äôd be time to play with his new toy
20-01-2021T14:13:57,SpazztasticKiwi,all the doodles
20-01-2021T14:14:15,Roughlandin,Tom is like the breeze. Floating hither and thither to his whim
20-01-2021T14:15:59,Roughlandin,"I'm gonna put that in my suggestion list for Pride in June, either way. It's cute and the worst he can do is not add it to the poll. *Shrugs*"
20-01-2021T14:16:53,CrimsonQuill,"Whadya think'd happen if one of the snow wolves-Raine, Roselyn, Euchre-met Aisling from Secret of Kells? She sometimes appears as a white wolf herself (being a Tuatha de Danann)"

20-01-2021T14:18:26,SpazztasticKiwi,alrighty there‚Äôs my cue - the car is ready to go
20-01-2021T14:18:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I must run my errands

20-01-2021T14:18:47,CrimsonQuill,(Good health)
20-01-2021T14:20:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I have 4 things to do & watch me forget something
20-01-2021T14:23:31,NinoGD,oof
20-01-2021T14:24:07,SpazztasticKiwi,putting my coat on backwards is a good sign
20-01-2021T14:29:08,SpazztasticKiwi,oh and Penelope‚Äôs cat mom found out she‚Äôs got covid yesterday

20-01-2021T14:36:39,SpazztasticKiwi,but she just got out of her cast for that ligament surgery
20-01-2021T14:37:08,Roughlandin,Hopefully that's as bad as it gets. Sending positive vibes!
20-01-2021T14:39:10,SpazztasticKiwi,she‚Äôs one of my older cousins but only by a few years
20-01-2021T14:39:24,SpazztasticKiwi,so she‚Äôs got youth on her side
20-01-2021T14:43:50,Roughlandin,That's good. Tell her of rest and hydration!
20-01-2021T14:43:55,Roughlandin,lots of

20-01-2021T15:34:50,CrimsonQuill,I wonder what I'd be...either a cat or a Peacock.
20-01-2021T15:34:53,CrimsonQuill,Perhaps.
20-01-2021T15:35:05,CrimsonQuill,Or a goose.
20-01-2021T15:35:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I took a minute at the atm because I couldn‚Äôt figure out where I put my phone down
20-01-2021T15:35:49,Zakuru,bird furries are underrated
20-01-2021T15:36:37,TerraTheWizard,i know someone with a peacock oc
20-01-2021T15:37:23,Zakuru,lovely
20-01-2021T15:37:47,AspiringNoodle,blue jay prettiest birb
20-01-2021T15:37:51,TerraTheWizard,think he's only used it once so far though
20-01-2021T15:38:14,CrimsonQuill,I used to have our peacock as my profile picture. He sadly passed away...
20-01-2021T15:38:22,CrimsonQuill,And his daddy before him....
20-01-2021T15:38:53,Zakuru,"if there is a ""bird"" oc its always a gryphon and i don't count those"
20-01-2021T15:39:01,CrimsonQuill,Lucky was quite lucky. And the spitting image of his father.
20-01-2021T15:39:36,CrimsonQuill,I have several photographs of him...I might bring him back as my PFP just because my OC's been here a while.
20-01-2021T15:39:49,CrimsonQuill,"Come to think of it, what would a Peafowl character look like?"
20-01-2021T15:40:00,BlueStreak98,I've seen a few birbsonas here and there
20-01-2021T15:40:05,BlueStreak98,I'm not a birb fan myself
20-01-2021T15:40:07,CrimsonQuill,I'm thinking something like Lord Shen in Kung Fu Panda.
20-01-2021T15:41:20,Zakuru,peafowl can look however you want if you are creative enough
20-01-2021T15:42:00,CrimsonQuill,"That is true, I suppose. Lucky could be a little derpy sometimes."
20-01-2021T15:42:15,CrimsonQuill,He loved doc leaves...and was very energetic
20-01-2021T15:44:16,Roughlandin,Fluff and Ruaidri make sum pretty birbs
20-01-2021T15:46:09,Roughlandin,Stolas from Helluva Boss is Owl Daddy. I want to help him raise his angsty birb daughter and have him sing me songs about how everything is going to be okay. :two_hearts:

20-01-2021T16:09:42,TerraTheWizard,but wowee
20-01-2021T16:09:59,CrimsonQuill,"...I actually don't honestly like where this is going. I'm expecting Clovis to suddenly pull a Sith and just 'get rid' of Brutus so he won't worry about him before...but at the same time, he broke into the manor to help him personally...."
20-01-2021T16:10:03,TerraTheWizard,you nailed clovis' underlying assholery
20-01-2021T16:10:14,CrimsonQuill,There are so many layers to it!
20-01-2021T16:10:37,CrimsonQuill,"We can see him at his most...manipulative, charming, and even vulnerable..."
20-01-2021T16:11:21,Zakuru,Conceal don't feel
20-01-2021T16:12:22,SpaceCadety,"I wonder what he'd be like if someone pulled a Trace on him, and he just woke up in a field someplace.  Probably as a she, with no memories."
20-01-2021T16:14:18,SpaceCadety,"Probably still an ass, but substantially less of an ass than he currently is?"
20-01-2021T16:14:39,Zakuru,you can be an ass and have a heart
20-01-2021T16:14:57,Roughlandin,...I've got a bad feeling about this
20-01-2021T16:15:06,CrimsonQuill,@Roughlandin Ditto...
20-01-2021T16:15:17,Zakuru,im hoping for the best ;w;
20-01-2021T16:16:14,Roughlandin,"Same. On one hand, it seems like Clovis is... trying... to be nice. On the other, he calls Brutus ""A weakness I've allowed myself to tolerate."""
20-01-2021T16:16:26,Roughlandin,...Clovis doesn't like to tolerate weaknesses
20-01-2021T16:16:34,Roughlandin,...He likes to eliminate them
20-01-2021T16:16:54,Zakuru,"he could consider his options, because still, brutus is very valuable"
20-01-2021T16:17:40,CrimsonQuill,"@Roughlandin My thoughts exactly. I might be going too far with his ""I wouldn't kill you that way"", but he never stated outright that he WOULDN'T kill him.."
20-01-2021T16:17:48,CrimsonQuill,We shall have to see.
20-01-2021T16:17:51,Roughlandin,Yeah. Not THAT way
20-01-2021T16:17:51,CrimsonQuill,"Tom, well done."
20-01-2021T16:18:04,CrimsonQuill,This page is a very good one indeed.
20-01-2021T16:18:09,Roughlandin,"Awesome page, Tom!"
20-01-2021T16:18:22,SpaceCadety,"Yeah, he's still in a mansion owned by a former insane genocidal maniac.  Killing off assets right now wouldn't be a great plan."

20-01-2021T16:22:50,Zakuru,fire battle!!
20-01-2021T16:22:51,Roughlandin,"That's gonna be the big question, isn't it"
20-01-2021T16:25:00,SpaceCadety,"I figure Clovis probably has an edge magic wise, being protected from Reni's while also probably knowing more about combat magic.  But still, Reni is a dragon, and can just pummel him into the ground, not sure the amulet can stop that."
20-01-2021T16:25:47,Roughlandin,Dragons ARE magic. I would think Reni could go a lot longer unless Clovis has REALLY been training to combat Mana Burn
20-01-2021T16:26:55,LunarSchnitzel,That's probably be what did him in. the amulet stopped the nora magic on the estate so i doubt reni could do much to him while he has mana
20-01-2021T16:27:20,CrimsonQuill,"Reni's also shown herself to be skilled at teleporting, being able to teleport right on top of Brutus before punting him off the wall."
20-01-2021T16:28:03,CrimsonQuill,"While Clovis has his own tricks, if she were able to flank him there's a chance (depending on the layers of protection granted by the amulet) that she could give it to him the muggle way."
20-01-2021T16:28:07,CrimsonQuill,A sock to the jaw.
20-01-2021T16:28:18,SpaceCadety,"Clovis' amulet protects him from dragon magic, teleporting is still blocked in the manor, and she wasn't immune to being clawed by the golems."
20-01-2021T16:28:25,CrimsonQuill,"But again, extenuating factors and individual skill and luck would decide the matter."
20-01-2021T16:28:41,CrimsonQuill,"Reni is still a young dragon, and was struggling against the old guardians."
20-01-2021T16:29:01,CrimsonQuill,Clovis has...a lot of money to buy some cheats.
20-01-2021T16:29:37,Twokinds,Clovis is definitely pay to win
20-01-2021T16:30:00,TerraTheWizard,">Reni's also shown herself to be skilled at teleporting, being able to teleport right on top of Brutus before punting him off the wall."

20-01-2021T16:36:08,SpazztasticKiwi,do I buy a hand vac or go ahead and get a full model

20-01-2021T16:37:24,SpazztasticKiwi,$10 more & they got a full size
20-01-2021T16:37:47,Roughlandin,Spend the extra 10
20-01-2021T16:37:55,SpaceCadety,"pretty sure if Clovis was confronted by both Reni and Trace he'd probably either just make a break for it, or surrender."
20-01-2021T16:39:55,SpaceCadety,"IDK, a full sized vacuum for only $10 more than a hand vac seems like either a very expensive hand model, or a cheap full sized"
20-01-2021T16:40:12,SpaceCadety,check reviews.
20-01-2021T16:40:13,SpazztasticKiwi,cats are terrified of the hand vac I had
