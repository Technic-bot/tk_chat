20-02-2021T16:26:30,SpazztasticKiwi,unfortunately this means some folks are more interested in talking to me

20-02-2021T17:36:41,RimaDraws,just got home from work
20-02-2021T17:36:45,Edgewalker,oof
20-02-2021T17:36:45,MviluUatusun,The most aggravating thing about being in the hospital was the fact that most of the sites I'm a member of were blocked.
20-02-2021T17:36:49,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,"Young Rose: ""I don't have a butt!!"""
20-02-2021T17:36:50,ShamusTheFox,Welcome!
20-02-2021T17:37:15,CrimsonQuill086,"How do farms work in Twokinds actually? Are they like farms of the pre-enclosure era, with common ground for the poorer folk and seperate estates for the wealthy?"
20-02-2021T17:37:24,MviluUatusun,"So, many of the people who know me online didn't know I was in the hospital."
20-02-2021T17:37:31,RimaDraws,i didnt
20-02-2021T17:37:32,ThingsAreMoving,"Wait, so not only you have to buy some kind of health insurance, it only applies to certain locations?"
20-02-2021T17:37:32,CrimsonQuill086,Or are they post-enclosure type arrangements with seperate fields owned privatley?
20-02-2021T17:37:36,Edgewalker,that is very sucky
20-02-2021T17:37:51,MuonNeutrino,"well, keidran are primarily carnivorous, so that probably makes things even more different"
20-02-2021T17:37:51,Edgewalker,also i'm envious of proportion placement....
20-02-2021T17:37:54,Twokinds,It'd probably vary a lot from place to place.
20-02-2021T17:38:05,RimaDraws,hi tom
20-02-2021T17:38:08,Twokinds,hello
20-02-2021T17:38:25,Edgewalker,"maybe fiefdom in some areas, communal in others?"
20-02-2021T17:38:30,Twokinds,I imagine lots of people own private farms on their land. But most of the major farmland would be owned by the local lord.
20-02-2021T17:38:42,MuonNeutrino,i'd assume a good chunk of their efforts in that area would go to support animal husbandry too
20-02-2021T17:38:43,ChromaticBard,"How are you doing today, Rima?"
20-02-2021T17:38:47,CrimsonQuill086,So similar to a Feudal system.
20-02-2021T17:38:52,CrimsonQuill086,Quite interesting.
20-02-2021T17:38:55,ProsePro7,Feudalism
20-02-2021T17:38:58,ZapiliDver,100% Feudal sys
20-02-2021T17:39:03,MuonNeutrino,"well, that tracks with what little we know of the various societies in the setting"
20-02-2021T17:39:06,MviluUatusun,"Or possibly the Templars, Tom?"
20-02-2021T17:39:07,MuonNeutrino,"they've got lords and nobles, so"
20-02-2021T17:39:09,CrimsonQuill086,Also...what would Keidran farm? Given that they can't eat bread.
20-02-2021T17:39:11,ProsePro7,Back to work Serfs!
20-02-2021T17:39:21,ShamusTheFox,"In Trace's case, just a place out back to put all the transformed intruders?"
20-02-2021T17:39:24,MuonNeutrino,feed for animals i'd bet
20-02-2021T17:39:35,ThingsAreMoving,Aren't keidran hunters + gatherers?
20-02-2021T17:39:43,MviluUatusun,"They could grow wheat, Crimson.  They'd just trade it to the humans."
20-02-2021T17:39:52,MuonNeutrino,"if rose is described several times as a farm girl, i woujldn't think so"
20-02-2021T17:39:59,Twokinds,No
20-02-2021T17:40:06,Twokinds,It depends a lot on which Keidran
20-02-2021T17:40:23,Ordithus,Flora seems particularly meat oriented
20-02-2021T17:40:34,ProsePro7,Different cultures different types of agricultural systems
20-02-2021T17:40:43,Twokinds,But they're not all hunter gatherers definitely
20-02-2021T17:40:50,ThingsAreMoving,Lore :eyes:
20-02-2021T17:40:51,Avolendi,"If you have a bunch cities and villages, then hunter-gatherers are (at least for that group) pretty much a no-go"
20-02-2021T17:40:51,MviluUatusun,"Well, Flora IS a tigress."
20-02-2021T17:40:54,CrimsonQuill086,"I did consider trading, but given poor at best relations between keidran and humans it seems unlikely"
20-02-2021T17:41:03,ShamusTheFox,Are there Keidran that aren't predator species?
20-02-2021T17:41:05,BaskervilleNQH,"We're getting some real hot lore, here~"
20-02-2021T17:41:12,Ordithus,Man sometime we need to see what Keidran cities look like
20-02-2021T17:41:12,Twokinds,no
20-02-2021T17:41:23,CrimsonQuill086,Perhaps Keidran are mainly livestock farmers.
20-02-2021T17:41:23,ProsePro7,The dog keidran might be more a farmers than the others since dogs are designed to eat almost anything
20-02-2021T17:41:23,ThingsAreMoving,+1 Ord
20-02-2021T17:41:25,Ordithus,I think you've described them a few times. But I wanna seeee :eyes:
20-02-2021T17:41:35,CrimsonQuill086,That means they'd need to grow grains to feed said livestock.
20-02-2021T17:41:44,Avolendi,"Ah Keidran cities, right. Was thinking of human lands"
20-02-2021T17:41:46,ThingsAreMoving,We've only seen Tiger clan tribe huts
20-02-2021T17:41:46,MuonNeutrino,"that's the most likely, yes"
20-02-2021T17:41:47,Pwatcher67,hi all
20-02-2021T17:41:50,Avolendi,No clue on that no

20-02-2021T17:41:55,CrimsonQuill086,"So, the Hay Rose'd have helped harvest could be used to feed Cattle and horses and so on"

20-02-2021T17:42:07,Sammit,Hi Pwatcher
20-02-2021T17:42:10,ProsePro7,Then there is the idea that they might be steppe nomad like the Mongols
20-02-2021T17:42:11,LunarSchnitzel,Howdy Pwatcher
20-02-2021T17:42:17,ChromaticBard,Hey Pwatcher
20-02-2021T17:42:18,ShamusTheFox,Greets!
20-02-2021T17:42:20,MuonNeutrino,"keidran eat way more meat than humans, they almost *have* to be raising dedicated herds of animals to support population densities even approaching what would be necessary to be realistic competitors to the humans"

20-02-2021T17:42:35,CrRAR,hec yeah :hamburger:

20-02-2021T17:42:45,MuonNeutrino,"@ProsePro7 IIRC the tigers were described as nomads, but it seems like the wolves aren't if rose is a 'farm girl'"
20-02-2021T17:42:52,CrimsonQuill086,Poultry seem to be the most efficient supply of meat then.
20-02-2021T17:43:08,ThingsAreMoving,I've been experimenting with burgers. But my weight started shifting upwards so I had to make a hard stop.
20-02-2021T17:43:11,MuonNeutrino,probably a variety
20-02-2021T17:43:21,Ordithus,"but, for science, things"
20-02-2021T17:43:22,ThingsAreMoving,eating oatmeal for four days in a row now xD
20-02-2021T17:43:30,SpazztasticKiwi,not burgers
20-02-2021T17:43:33,KeefMcDerpface,four days
20-02-2021T17:43:36,CrRAR,oh?
20-02-2021T17:43:38,CrimsonQuill086,I 'ave to go gluten and dairy free again...got sick after a glass of milk.
20-02-2021T17:43:39,ThingsAreMoving,I know what sliders are
20-02-2021T17:43:40,KeefMcDerpface,I wish you luck.
20-02-2021T17:43:56,ThingsAreMoving,"Eh, it's not too bad. I like it. tbh"
20-02-2021T17:44:01,CrimsonQuill086,Good luck with the porridge things
20-02-2021T17:44:07,ShamusTheFox,I just had a burger. I'll chase it with some fruit or something later.
20-02-2021T17:44:07,Ordithus,oatmeal is a good base
20-02-2021T17:44:10,CrimsonQuill086,It's nice-try it with nuts and bananas
20-02-2021T17:44:12,CrimsonQuill086,Or blueberries
20-02-2021T17:44:18,Ordithus,I'm just usually too lazy to put much on it :P
20-02-2021T17:44:26,CrRAR,what kinda sliders then?
20-02-2021T17:44:26,ThingsAreMoving,Just a banana and some cinnamon
20-02-2021T17:44:28,CrRAR,pulled pokr?

20-02-2021T17:44:42,CrRAR,oh nice
20-02-2021T17:44:49,CrimsonQuill086,Apparently a good and varied start to the day
20-02-2021T17:44:50,SpazztasticKiwi,do you people not have meat n cheese sliders
20-02-2021T17:44:51,microbuss,yay pulled-pork

20-02-2021T17:45:03,CrimsonQuill086,"Oh, pulled-pork slow roasted is HEAVEN"
20-02-2021T17:45:05,microbuss,sliders from where?
20-02-2021T17:45:19,CrRAR,"I guess any tiny sandwich can be a slider, really"
20-02-2021T17:45:26,falangie123,is a slider just a small burger??
20-02-2021T17:45:36,ThingsAreMoving,I usually stuff some meat and cheese with some veggies in a bun. Is that a slider?
20-02-2021T17:45:48,ShamusTheFox,When does a slider become a burger?
20-02-2021T17:45:56,MuonNeutrino,"when it reaches a normal burger size, i'd assume"
20-02-2021T17:46:05,ThingsAreMoving,"When a beef patty is applied, Shamus"
20-02-2021T17:46:21,CrRAR,I always associated other meats in tint sandwiches to be finger sandwiches I guess
20-02-2021T17:46:22,MuonNeutrino,sliders can have a beef patty?
20-02-2021T17:46:36,ShamusTheFox,Thimble burgers
20-02-2021T17:46:40,MuonNeutrino,they're basically just mini burgers
20-02-2021T17:46:50,MuonNeutrino,they can have anything in them that a burger does
20-02-2021T17:47:12,ShamusTheFox,Pawbs

20-02-2021T17:47:27,ThingsAreMoving,I'm confus
20-02-2021T17:47:30,MuonNeutrino,the size

20-02-2021T17:57:09,MuonNeutrino,and yeahhhhhhhhhh i involuntarily winced when i saw that page >.>
20-02-2021T17:57:15,MuonNeutrino,"excuse me, that is clearly a +5 butt"
20-02-2021T17:57:31,ThingsAreMoving,"Prose, there are cmopanies that do them, I'd wager."
20-02-2021T17:57:34,ProsePro7,Excuse you all that is a 10 out of 10
20-02-2021T17:57:43,ThingsAreMoving,You'd have to goole 'custom dakimakura'
20-02-2021T17:57:48,ThingsAreMoving,google even
20-02-2021T17:58:10,Jeebuus,"Man, Rose is beautiful."
20-02-2021T17:58:12,ProsePro7,I think I have too much dignity to do that Things
20-02-2021T17:58:17,ZapiliDver,results may perv
20-02-2021T17:58:17,MuonNeutrino,"hmm. Ivy should be sleeping on one of those round tiger beds, that would be an interesting change of pace for this series"
20-02-2021T17:58:26,ProsePro7,Not much but just enough
20-02-2021T17:58:26,Jeebuus,"Tom, you'd make a killin' if you sold dakis"
20-02-2021T17:58:57,ProsePro7,I agree with Muon on this
20-02-2021T17:59:24,MuonNeutrino,"well given how tom's starting this looks like maybe an overhead shot, so could be"
20-02-2021T17:59:45,Jeebuus,Would be a nice change to an otherwise repetitive series ngl.
20-02-2021T18:00:06,MuonNeutrino,"well, being a very off the wall character does make some difference already, but yeah it would be neat"
20-02-2021T18:00:32,Ordithus,hmm audio nevermind it's perfectly fine
20-02-2021T18:00:36,Jeebuus,For sure but this concept has kinda run its course imo.
20-02-2021T18:01:02,ProsePro7,This might be a looking up from back shot.  That would be an interesting angle
20-02-2021T18:01:10,MuonNeutrino,"probably, though i'd rather have one of these than more VV"

20-02-2021T18:02:45,falangie123,not that im complaining
20-02-2021T18:02:57,MuonNeutrino,we've had way more than 3 i think
20-02-2021T18:03:04,Avolendi,"Muon, actually already had such a bed for the good morning Adira + Maeve"
20-02-2021T18:03:09,ThingsAreMoving,"And we've had ref sheets before that, charts, Therie x Daniels, and many more fads"
20-02-2021T18:03:12,ThingsAreMoving,they come and go
20-02-2021T18:03:42,ShamusTheFox,And sometimes they are revived.
20-02-2021T18:03:48,MuonNeutrino,"hm, i'd forgotten about the adira one"
20-02-2021T18:04:06,ShamusTheFox,Like the Thanksgiving gag
20-02-2021T18:04:40,ThingsAreMoving,Or mistletoe. The longest running fad
20-02-2021T18:04:55,ThingsAreMoving,One of the best ones imho
20-02-2021T18:05:23,Jeebuus,The mistletoe concept is interesting tho
20-02-2021T18:05:35,Ordithus,:eyes: oh my god this face! so cute
20-02-2021T18:05:45,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,good morning is just ladies sitting up on a bed

20-02-2021T18:14:19,MuonNeutrino,"well, flora was taken as a slave in the raid that killed her parents, i don't see why it'd be impossible that her sister was also captured rather than killed, especially since flora's character entry says her *parents* were killed, not 'family'"
20-02-2021T18:14:26,ThingsAreMoving,Eh no problem. But thanks :ctwokinds-rainehappy:
20-02-2021T18:14:48,TeapotOfDoom,tom is ivy like flora or are there key differences?
20-02-2021T18:15:02,CrRAR,more rounded ears for one
20-02-2021T18:15:04,KeefMcDerpface,"Well, she's younger."
20-02-2021T18:15:08,TeapotOfDoom,is she just a more intense version of her bigger sister
20-02-2021T18:15:10,ProsePro7,"She looks like she has the fluffiest ears ever, wanna touch!"
20-02-2021T18:15:16,CrRAR,indeed
20-02-2021T18:15:19,MuonNeutrino,"well, just on appearance she has rounder ears, slightly different facial shape and stripe patterns, and seems even flatter"
20-02-2021T18:15:29,ThingsAreMoving,Are young tigers more fluffy than adults? :ctwokinds-floraquestion:
20-02-2021T18:15:31,CrimsonQuill086,Stripes follow a different pattern
20-02-2021T18:15:33,ThingsAreMoving,Or is it just Ivy?
20-02-2021T18:15:57,ProsePro7,She does look like she has a nice butt like her sister tough
20-02-2021T18:16:04,MuonNeutrino,"also ivy is at most three years younger than flora, so she's younger than her but still over 8 and an adult at the current comic time"

20-02-2021T18:17:26,ShamusTheFox,I wonder if Ivy has Flora's temper?
20-02-2021T18:17:29,RandomTonio,Seems that Ivy is finally getting recognition

20-02-2021T18:18:48,RandomTonio,And it seems that it is popular enough for fans to want another Ivy sketch
20-02-2021T18:18:52,MuonNeutrino,and she definitely does seem even more petite than flora
20-02-2021T18:19:02,CrRAR,yeah
20-02-2021T18:19:10,Ordithus,"oh yeah, no surprise. I just fine the ""finally"" part of your statement funny"
20-02-2021T18:19:15,MuonNeutrino,"also by her 'ah cool a human' reaction in the previous sketch, maybe she *wasn't* caught as a slave and escaped instead?"
20-02-2021T18:19:15,Ordithus,"er, find"
20-02-2021T18:19:36,MuonNeutrino,ofc that is speculation piled on top of speculation
20-02-2021T18:19:36,SpazztasticKiwi,probably an anti premature spurtage cap
20-02-2021T18:19:41,CrRAR,yeah
