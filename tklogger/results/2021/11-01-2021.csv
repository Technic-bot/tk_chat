11-01-2021T19:00:39,CrRAR,a whole transmission? a lot
11-01-2021T19:01:27,CrRAR,the price would vary wildly depending on dealership vs local shop
11-01-2021T19:05:08,SpazztasticKiwi,define alot
11-01-2021T19:06:12,SpazztasticKiwi,they‚Äôre almost giving away the car & if I can get it n end up paying nothing but what‚Äôs broke I‚Äôll take it
11-01-2021T19:06:39,SpazztasticKiwi,except replacing an engine
11-01-2021T19:10:48,CrRAR,I feel like anywhere between like low end 1200 to mid 2000s depending. I'm sure there:s accurate estimators online for the model
11-01-2021T19:11:55,CrRAR,"depends if the trans is like new or salvaged or whatever too, dealerships would probably be even more"
11-01-2021T19:12:16,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs a dodge ram 1800/1500

11-01-2021T19:17:24,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs probably something they can‚Äôt afford
11-01-2021T19:17:40,CrRAR,lots of times those type of deals are meant for like a hobbiest or shop looking to do rehab work
11-01-2021T19:17:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I guessed some information for a kelly blue book repair estimate

11-01-2021T19:18:58,SpazztasticKiwi,could be the miles I gave it or the year
11-01-2021T19:19:10,CrRAR,there has to be transmission listings for that model somewhere
11-01-2021T19:19:47,SpazztasticKiwi,also had to guess if it was a quad/club/short bed/long bed and a few other ridiculously variable qualities
11-01-2021T19:20:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"truck is truck, gimme an answer"
11-01-2021T19:21:05,SpazztasticKiwi,if it‚Äôs this much trouble to research the estimate it‚Äôs not worth trying
11-01-2021T19:21:09,CrRAR,"I feel like working on a truck is easier than working on small cars, but it's the labor cost that kills you when it come to tranny work."
11-01-2021T19:22:35,CrRAR,if the cost/benefit was worth it the owner might have considered doing it themselves
11-01-2021T19:22:45,CrRAR,hence hucking it instead
11-01-2021T19:23:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I look because something breaking that the owner can‚Äôt afford to fix is something I know I‚Äôm likely able to benefit from
11-01-2021T19:23:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve been saving for a car for years
11-01-2021T19:24:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"with the stimulus checks I‚Äôve saved, I have enough to get a car in full but if I can get one for little and pay a little more to get new parts"
11-01-2021T19:24:57,CrRAR,"if the miles aren't crazy, taking the leap might be worth it... but at some point they all become a money pit"
11-01-2021T19:24:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I can still come out cheaper

11-01-2021T21:05:01,Twokinds,"I honestly didn't know if you wanted past Rose and Trace, or present two"
11-01-2021T21:31:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I watched beauty and the beast
11-01-2021T21:31:11,SpazztasticKiwi,the Christmas sequel
11-01-2021T21:32:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I had the thought of that scene in spongebob where spongebob pops in on squidwards bath
11-01-2021T21:33:16,SpazztasticKiwi,that scream
11-01-2021T21:41:58,CrRAR,:owl: o rly

11-01-2021T21:42:28,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-laura: then you'll just LOVE the sing-a-long edition
11-01-2021T21:43:08,CrRAR,did it have sing-a-longs?
11-01-2021T21:43:21,SpazztasticKiwi,it was just the movie
11-01-2021T21:43:32,CrRAR,ah okay haha
11-01-2021T21:43:42,SpazztasticKiwi,but like all disney there was music
11-01-2021T21:44:08,SpazztasticKiwi,you realize the last time I saw it could probably be close to 20 years ago too
11-01-2021T21:44:25,CrRAR,sounds about right
11-01-2021T21:44:49,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs definitely dated
11-01-2021T21:45:07,CrRAR,sequel or prequel or what chronology?
11-01-2021T21:45:55,SpazztasticKiwi,it came out after beauty and the beast but it places itself mid-curse
11-01-2021T21:46:47,SpazztasticKiwi,potts tells chip - who is present in the story mind you - as a Christmas tale by the tree when they‚Äôre all human
11-01-2021T21:46:56,CrRAR,"it would be funny not cursed ""who is this and what have you done with the beastman?"""
11-01-2021T21:47:20,SpazztasticKiwi,honestly he was more attractive as the beast
11-01-2021T21:47:35,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-sytheeyebrows:
11-01-2021T21:47:42,SpazztasticKiwi,human adam is not all that hot
11-01-2021T21:47:51,CrRAR,does Gaston get further yuletide commupance?
11-01-2021T21:48:03,SpazztasticKiwi,he doesn‚Äôt show up
11-01-2021T21:48:20,CrRAR,"oh good, no one invited that jerk"
11-01-2021T21:49:15,CrRAR,for some reason I just imagine just a clueless Little Mermaid Eric as untransformed Beast
11-01-2021T21:49:29,CrRAR,I forget who he becomes/was
11-01-2021T21:50:49,SpazztasticKiwi,belle could‚Äôve easily scared him off by going on one date with him & being the biggest obnoxious night out he‚Äôs had
11-01-2021T21:51:49,CrRAR,yeah he was pretty skittish for a buffalo-man
11-01-2021T21:52:03,SpazztasticKiwi,gaston
11-01-2021T21:52:42,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs either that or get rid of him with a shotgun to the face
11-01-2021T21:52:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm good with either
11-01-2021T21:53:18,SpazztasticKiwi,& eric is black haired
11-01-2021T21:53:27,SpazztasticKiwi,beast is blonde brunette
11-01-2021T21:53:52,CrRAR,"yeah, weird brain substitution"
11-01-2021T21:57:47,CrRAR,"huh, the pipe organ (bad guy?) is voiced by Tim Curry"
11-01-2021T22:01:57,SpazztasticKiwi,with the way that  guy looks human I‚Äôm surprised they didn‚Äôt throw him out immediately
11-01-2021T22:02:08,SpazztasticKiwi,dude just screams villain with that kind of face
11-01-2021T22:02:23,CrRAR,he was the original pennywise
11-01-2021T22:02:35,SpazztasticKiwi,out here looking like voldemort & michael jackson had a baby
11-01-2021T22:02:51,CrRAR,he's basically a career villian actor guy haha
11-01-2021T22:03:09,SpazztasticKiwi,got a face like he was on fire & someone put it out with an ashy shovel
11-01-2021T22:03:28,SpazztasticKiwi,bro got permanent sour face
11-01-2021T22:03:31,CrRAR,he was the hotel jerk that wasn't Rob Schnider in home alone 2 as well

11-01-2021T22:05:40,CrRAR,thing ain't gonna move itself out the door
11-01-2021T22:06:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"whoever did character design for that movie didn‚Äôt try with him because he‚Äôs the only one with the pale, permanent evil scowl expression"
11-01-2021T22:07:34,CrRAR,"effective villian, basically makes his own theme music"
11-01-2021T22:07:50,CrRAR,efficient~
11-01-2021T22:08:32,SpazztasticKiwi,blaring ominous organ music
11-01-2021T22:09:26,SpazztasticKiwi,he practically had ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the villain‚Äù tattooed on him
11-01-2021T22:09:41,CrRAR,"turns out beast wasn't all bad all along, he was just scored that way. ;_;"
11-01-2021T22:10:10,CrRAR,people will believe EVERYTHING you do is evil with that kind of background music
11-01-2021T22:10:32,Ordithus,guess he didn't get the memo - the league of EVIL has decided that evil should be sexy
