27-01-2021T12:32:49,NinoGD,noice
27-01-2021T12:33:14,AspiringNoodle,Been playing WoW classic
27-01-2021T12:33:20,NinoGD,hi noodle
27-01-2021T12:33:38,AspiringNoodle,First: RIP that shark
27-01-2021T12:34:01,AspiringNoodle,"2nd: Classic is fun, but JFC did Blizzard have some questionable design decisions"
27-01-2021T12:34:25,AspiringNoodle,"Just finished one quest after dying 3+ times, because the quest doesn't suggest it should be done in a group, but boy should it"
27-01-2021T12:35:09,NinoGD,I'm making a gd level layout
27-01-2021T12:35:48,AspiringNoodle,"The NPC I needed to kill had 2 other mobs with him, but that wasn't the issue"
27-01-2021T12:36:07,NinoGD,I was testing the layout so far and died at 69%
27-01-2021T12:36:14,AspiringNoodle,"The issue was that the NPC I needed to kill had this hidden effect where when you pull him, the aggro radius of surrounding gnolls becomes much larger"
27-01-2021T12:36:32,AspiringNoodle,"So, I'd clear out a bunch of room, pull him, then suddenly get swarmed by 2 - 3 extra gnolls I didn't plan on"
27-01-2021T12:37:23,AspiringNoodle,"Good thing I'm playing a Dwarf holy paladin, because I'm stubborn and this setup allows me to do so xD"
27-01-2021T12:44:34,AspiringNoodle,Man... when I think about it
27-01-2021T12:44:50,AspiringNoodle,"If I didn't do that paladin class quest and get this mace, idk how I'd be fairing right now"
