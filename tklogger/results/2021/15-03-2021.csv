15-03-2021T19:03:20,SpazztasticKiwi,this is a stupid question but is titanium/steel stronger than gold
15-03-2021T19:03:50,SpazztasticKiwi,you know what I could ask google
15-03-2021T19:04:37,SpazztasticKiwi,it was a stupid question

15-03-2021T19:05:14,AlfredoMiraJF,night quill
15-03-2021T19:20:17,CrRAR,gold highly pure is actually more bendy like lead
15-03-2021T19:20:48,CrRAR,like that‚Äôs why 24k gold isn‚Äôt ideal for certain wearables
15-03-2021T19:21:29,CrRAR,"melting points are usually better for steel, titanium"
15-03-2021T19:22:37,CrRAR,"tungsten has very high melting point, I think titanium also has anti-corrosive properties like gold so it‚Äôs good for medical uses like implants"
15-03-2021T19:22:50,CrRAR,and things near the ocean
15-03-2021T19:26:33,CrRAR,:cruise_ship:
15-03-2021T19:30:56,SonOfGoku,Its also good for planes and rockets
15-03-2021T19:32:35,CrRAR,"yeah decent stand in for aluminum, stronger. Aluminum shears easily."
15-03-2021T19:34:16,CrRAR,aluminum quite ridgid and can hold structure but gives like twig under particular stressors
15-03-2021T19:34:45,CrRAR,kinda like bones
15-03-2021T19:35:03,CrRAR,"when they break, they fracture"
15-03-2021T19:35:19,CrRAR,same with aluminum sorta
15-03-2021T19:35:32,CrRAR,reach limit = done
15-03-2021T19:40:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw a gag video
15-03-2021T19:40:41,SpazztasticKiwi,dude ‚Äúproposed‚Äù but dropped the ring down a sewer grate and got it back with a magnet
15-03-2021T19:40:53,CrRAR,pff
15-03-2021T19:41:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"soooo, it wasn‚Äôt gold"

15-03-2021T19:41:31,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-flomad:
15-03-2021T19:41:50,SpazztasticKiwi,but honestly y u bother with a gold ring when steel is stronger
15-03-2021T19:42:04,SpazztasticKiwi,or titanium or whatever that material is class rings are
15-03-2021T19:42:09,CrRAR,lol true
15-03-2021T19:42:26,SpazztasticKiwi,& don‚Äôt give me the ‚Äúgold is worth more‚Äù it‚Äôs not - like diamonds

15-03-2021T19:43:09,CrRAR,"well, tbh, gold is at least a precious metal"
15-03-2021T19:43:15,CrRAR,it has value
15-03-2021T19:43:36,SpazztasticKiwi,only if you believe it doe
15-03-2021T19:43:40,SpazztasticKiwi,s
15-03-2021T19:43:41,AspiringNoodle,Gold is SUPER expensive
15-03-2021T19:43:45,CrRAR,diamonds don‚Äôt actually have an open market value
15-03-2021T19:43:48,AspiringNoodle,^
15-03-2021T19:44:01,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-clovischuckle: only what the jewel man tells ya
15-03-2021T19:44:18,AspiringNoodle,De Beers has a global monopoly on diamond supply
15-03-2021T19:44:35,AspiringNoodle,They control how much or little is actually sold to jewelers to make into jewelry
15-03-2021T19:44:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I like rose gold & chocolate diamonds but I‚Äôll wear about any jewelry if I find I like it & it matches
15-03-2021T19:45:08,CrRAR,Titanium honestly has a nice color
15-03-2021T19:45:13,AspiringNoodle,"Diamond jewelry is overpriced as hell.  You could buy a $7,000 piece of diamond jewelry, decide you don't want it the very next day and try to sell it.  And you'd get $1,000 if you're lucky."
15-03-2021T19:45:22,CrRAR,also Platinum is very pretty
15-03-2021T19:45:25,SpazztasticKiwi,see: my 15+ accessory ring collection
15-03-2021T19:45:39,AspiringNoodle,"Also, Titanium is ridiculously strong."
15-03-2021T19:46:36,AspiringNoodle,Some military aircraft need a to use Titanium for the outermost layer of the vehicle due to the stresses placed upon it.
15-03-2021T19:47:06,CrRAR,Yeah it‚Äôs like a stronger more fortified aluminum
15-03-2021T19:47:14,AspiringNoodle,Other metals either won't cut it or you'd need to use so much of them that it would make the vehicle useless.
15-03-2021T19:47:46,AspiringNoodle,And titanium jewelry is a pita for jewelers to deal with.  You basically can't work with titanium jewelry
15-03-2021T19:47:53,AspiringNoodle,The stuff will break their tools.
15-03-2021T19:48:23,AspiringNoodle,As for gold...
15-03-2021T19:48:33,CrRAR,yeah probably has to be like industrialy formed
15-03-2021T19:48:48,AspiringNoodle,Linus Tech Tips recently made a solid gold Xbox controller (final purity 18k for strength / durability)
15-03-2021T19:49:24,CrRAR,I think you can ‚Äòding‚Äô high purity gold easily
15-03-2021T19:49:51,AspiringNoodle,"It cost them 86,000CAD or 69,000 (nice) USD to buy the gold needed for casting."
15-03-2021T19:50:31,CrRAR,wow
15-03-2021T19:50:47,CrRAR,ah yeah solid
15-03-2021T19:50:52,AspiringNoodle,The final controller weighed ~3 lbs
15-03-2021T19:51:04,CrRAR,did they make it solid as like a trophy?
15-03-2021T19:51:14,AspiringNoodle,"Nope, they wanted a functional Xbox controller xD"
15-03-2021T19:51:26,CrRAR,oh
15-03-2021T19:51:44,AspiringNoodle,"Replaced the casing and triggers / bumpers with gold, kept the rest of the internals with some slight modifications to avoid shorts."
15-03-2021T19:51:53,CrRAR,yeahhhh
15-03-2021T19:52:02,CrRAR,veryyy conductiveee
15-03-2021T19:52:28,AspiringNoodle,"I think it's fair to say, when you buy diamond jewelry, you're paying for the diamonds"
15-03-2021T19:52:36,AspiringNoodle,"But when you SELL diamond jewelry, you're selling the gold..."
15-03-2021T19:52:48,AspiringNoodle,Or silver
15-03-2021T19:53:03,SonOfGoku,Diamonds are after all just a piece of carbon
15-03-2021T19:53:06,CrRAR,Diamonds are valuable to the heart~

15-03-2021T19:53:19,AspiringNoodle,"Oh yeah, let's not forget that they can make diamonds in labs, haha."
15-03-2021T19:53:38,CrRAR,"yeah, they been improving those processes"
15-03-2021T19:53:50,CrRAR,to make more pure ones
15-03-2021T19:54:00,AspiringNoodle,"I mean, they can also make rubies in a lab, but there are enough differences between that and natural rubies that you can't pass off the lab ones as legitimate :thinking:"
15-03-2021T19:54:15,CrRAR,They been making them forever already to use for industrial applications
15-03-2021T19:54:34,CrRAR,Diamond-tipped blades and such
15-03-2021T19:54:53,CrRAR,Those sure as heck aren‚Äôt tipped with De Beers diamonds xD
15-03-2021T19:55:17,CrRAR,‚Äúexpensive blade‚Äù
15-03-2021T19:55:26,CrRAR,"‚Äúnah, store brand diamonds‚Äù"
15-03-2021T19:55:31,CrRAR,‚Äúok‚Äù
15-03-2021T19:55:34,AspiringNoodle,"^ This, actually"
15-03-2021T19:55:47,AspiringNoodle,Diamonds used for industrial applications tend to be low grade and not suitable for jewelry
15-03-2021T19:56:06,CrRAR,yeah they don‚Äôt care as long as they have the strength
15-03-2021T19:56:35,CrRAR,"many are more yellow, or would have like cloudy pockets I guess"
15-03-2021T19:56:50,CrRAR,like ice that‚Äôs got those fine bubbles
15-03-2021T19:57:19,AspiringNoodle,"Oh yeah, get this.  There's a *really* rare type of ruby out there"
15-03-2021T19:57:42,AspiringNoodle,"It's difficult to find as a raw resource, because the end product looks drastically different."
15-03-2021T19:58:13,AspiringNoodle,The raw material needs to go through a lengthy and complicated process to transform it into this beautiful gemstone.
15-03-2021T19:58:22,AspiringNoodle,"But if you mess up, you can render the material worthless."
15-03-2021T19:58:30,CrRAR,"There is a service that sells synthetic diamond jewelry for engagments and such, one of my college friends went that route"
15-03-2021T19:58:59,CrRAR,just because of the whole ethical thing with the diamond trade
15-03-2021T19:59:15,CrRAR,mostly that at least
15-03-2021T19:59:40,CrRAR,but yeah it‚Äôs a preference choice
