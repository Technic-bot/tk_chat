23-01-2021T15:58:36,Glassan,Heyo Tom
23-01-2021T15:58:52,Ordithus,you don't remove the motor to replace a head gasket. You remove half the motor.
23-01-2021T15:58:55,Ordithus,As Marv said
23-01-2021T15:58:55,SpazztasticKiwi,asking $2500 but it repair looks like itd be another $1000
23-01-2021T15:59:04,CrRAR,yup

23-01-2021T16:00:14,AspiringNoodle,"My Focus is a '14, the only thing wrong with it was the near 93k miles it had back in '18.  But other than that, it was perfectly fine.  Original owner treated it well."
23-01-2021T16:00:22,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe somebodyll pick it up
23-01-2021T16:00:22,Roughlandin,I didn't know about the cooldown either after my fist win lol
23-01-2021T16:00:31,LunarSchnitzel,Meaning the same person can't get a suggestion 2 weeks in a row?
23-01-2021T16:00:35,Twokinds,Yaeh
23-01-2021T16:00:50,ProsePro7,No double win for you!
23-01-2021T16:00:56,AspiringNoodle,Gotta give other peeps a chance :P

23-01-2021T16:01:09,GammaEradon,Small price to pay.
23-01-2021T16:01:13,Ordithus,"One-a-month wouldn't be unreasonable, either"

23-01-2021T16:01:31,ProsePro7,Would be funny as hell if someone got like a 10 month winning streak
23-01-2021T16:01:32,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,I am on cooldown this week too
23-01-2021T16:01:36,IronHorseComics,*cough cough* like the Nora Cards were *cough*
23-01-2021T16:01:43,BadFoMo,"There was that one time, but that was a misspell that went through anyway."
23-01-2021T16:01:57,BlueStreak98,I've got a '13 Focus. Great car other than the transmission.
23-01-2021T16:02:05,Twokinds,It has happened before as a result of someone else suggesting the same thing.
23-01-2021T16:02:08,Ordithus,"'11 Focus, here"
23-01-2021T16:02:13,Roughlandin,I still chug along in my 08 charger lol
23-01-2021T16:02:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw a ford of some sort for sale too but it‚Äôs miles out of town
23-01-2021T16:02:21,Twokinds,"If someone submits the same thing as someone on cooldown, I will go ahead and add both names."
23-01-2021T16:02:25,SpazztasticKiwi,other than that I liked it
23-01-2021T16:02:29,ProsePro7,Hm...
23-01-2021T16:02:39,Glassan,Sounds fair.
23-01-2021T16:02:43,SpazztasticKiwi,may have been a focus
23-01-2021T16:02:48,Ordithus,I just skip suggesting while on cooldown. Less work for Tom
23-01-2021T16:02:59,SpazztasticKiwi,it was a hatchback sort of model
23-01-2021T16:03:01,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,I skip too

23-01-2021T16:03:56,Sammit,Hi Things
23-01-2021T16:04:02,Ordithus,"'11 is fine, that's the older version"

23-01-2021T16:04:17,MadGod317,Good afternoon y'all!

23-01-2021T16:04:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I'm very biased against ford, that being said.  Look for a toyota"
23-01-2021T16:04:31,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs well out of town anyway

23-01-2021T16:04:49,Zakuru,hope everyone is good this afternoon :ptv-hearts:
23-01-2021T16:04:51,SpazztasticKiwi,and I want to get something higher up
23-01-2021T16:05:03,Roughlandin,My brother used to have an 11 mustang with the ecoboost v6
23-01-2021T16:05:20,Roughlandin,He liked it but it would up getting stolen when he moved to LA
23-01-2021T16:05:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd like to ask a stupid question for $1000
23-01-2021T16:05:39,BadFoMo,"I submited things in the rare times I was on cooldown. But I would submit them as ""BadFo- UH... Steve""."
23-01-2021T16:05:39,Ordithus,"Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, or if you want something american, Ford Escape are what I'd recommend if you want a smallish SUV thing. Or a Mazda"
23-01-2021T16:05:42,AspiringNoodle,"BlueStreak, you mean things like the transmission can't decide what kind of gear it wants to use is certain situations?"
23-01-2021T16:05:50,AspiringNoodle,use in*
23-01-2021T16:06:04,Roughlandin,My brother owns one of the new hybrid RAV4's. He really likes it
23-01-2021T16:06:06,SpazztasticKiwi,how bad an idea would it be to invest in getting that dodge journey
23-01-2021T16:06:08,BlueStreak98,Yup. They're very prone to breaking.
23-01-2021T16:06:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Honda and Toyota are solid choices
23-01-2021T16:06:33,BlueStreak98,Ford extended the warranties on them but has thus far refused to recall them
23-01-2021T16:06:34,Ordithus,"Stay away from Dodge unless you really, really like the car. Unreliable messes, often"
23-01-2021T16:06:36,AspiringNoodle,"As it stands, the only issue I'm having with my car is that it waffles on power delivery in some circumstances"
23-01-2021T16:06:46,Roughlandin,I wouldn't touch new dodge cars. Since Fiat bought Chrysler the QC has gone out the window
23-01-2021T16:06:47,NezumiYuki,"*puts breakfast down long enough to say* Agrees with Marv, Toy and Honda are SOLID"
23-01-2021T16:07:11,BlueStreak98,"once the transmission inevitably fails, it's a good $3500 job to replace it"
23-01-2021T16:07:14,AspiringNoodle,"But I'm probably going to get a Civic Hatchback as my next car, assuming the design remains the same-ish when I do"
23-01-2021T16:07:22,BlueStreak98,a lot of them got lemon lawed
23-01-2021T16:07:28,SpazztasticKiwi,can I borrow one of y‚Äôall to take car shopping
23-01-2021T16:07:46,AspiringNoodle,"Aka, ""This is a flawed product, and you, the manufacturer, are solely responsible for providing all repairs""?"
23-01-2021T16:07:58,Roughlandin,Honestly? The newer Kias aren't bad for the money
23-01-2021T16:08:02,BlueStreak98,"Sure, just bring me back before the due date, I have late fees"
23-01-2021T16:08:32,SpazztasticKiwi,rent-a-grease-monkey
23-01-2021T16:08:36,Ordithus,Yeah hyundai and kia are pretty good
23-01-2021T16:08:56,BlueStreak98,Hyundai/Kia have improved markedly over the last 10-15 years
23-01-2021T16:08:57,Roughlandin,How about a repair bear? :bear::tools:
23-01-2021T16:09:04,BlueStreak98,Fix-it-fox

23-01-2021T16:09:24,SpazztasticKiwi,there‚Äôs something about them I really like
23-01-2021T16:09:27,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,how bout a Break-It-Dergon?
23-01-2021T16:09:30,NezumiYuki,"Kia and Hyundai used to be thought of like the Yugo... Cheap... somehwat reliable... basic get your butt to work or groceries, but now.. wow.. They're pretty much like hondas and toyotas these days"
23-01-2021T16:09:38,Roughlandin,My sister has a sorento and really likes it
23-01-2021T16:09:42,SpazztasticKiwi,you break it you buy it dragon
23-01-2021T16:10:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"kia sorento should be a solid car, but if you need it for any offroad stuff just get a old yukon"
23-01-2021T16:10:05,BlueStreak98,"Some of the Kia SUVs I've noticed have bad rearward visibility, even by modern SUV standards"
23-01-2021T16:10:38,BlueStreak98,Hyundai is reportedly being investigated for repeated fires in their vehicles
23-01-2021T16:10:42,SpazztasticKiwi,my grandmas had a......2000? sorento for a few years now
23-01-2021T16:11:09,CrRAR,yeah the new ones have come so far tho too
23-01-2021T16:11:12,BlueStreak98,"Kia and Hyundai are good, and certainly cheaper than Toyota/Honda, but I think I'd rather get the Japanese models myself"
23-01-2021T16:11:19,SpazztasticKiwi,hyundai: we didn‚Äôt start the fire
23-01-2021T16:11:22,CrRAR,so many advancements
23-01-2021T16:11:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"no, your cars did"
23-01-2021T16:11:41,Roughlandin,It was always burnin since the wheels were turnin

23-01-2021T16:12:13,SpazztasticKiwi,that‚Äôs not always something to brag about

23-01-2021T16:12:40,Roughlandin,Come down to Rough's Second Hand Hyundai where all our cars are on FIRE! LITERALLY!

23-01-2021T16:13:04,Glassan,I miss the ol' Ford firebomb.
23-01-2021T16:13:16,NezumiYuki,Ahem.... Ford Pinto
23-01-2021T16:13:18,SpazztasticKiwi,what‚Äôs that a car that blew itself up
23-01-2021T16:13:20,NezumiYuki,nuff said....
23-01-2021T16:13:22,Roughlandin,"If the van's a burnin, don't get a yearnin... to buy"

23-01-2021T16:13:32,Roughlandin,Hi Raine!
23-01-2021T16:13:32,BlueStreak98,My father had a Pinto years ago
23-01-2021T16:13:35,NezumiYuki,Hey welcome aboard Raine
23-01-2021T16:13:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,There have been a few cars that blew up >.>
23-01-2021T16:13:43,Glassan,"It wasn't that bad a car, overall."
23-01-2021T16:13:54,Roughlandin,As long as you don't get rear ended
23-01-2021T16:13:56,Glassan,Just had a massive design flaw in the fuel tank.
23-01-2021T16:14:03,BlueStreak98,He said it was a pretty good car--until it broke
23-01-2021T16:14:08,Glassan,Which was mostly to cut costs.
23-01-2021T16:14:11,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah that seems to be a thing that‚Äôs required to happen ever so often to at least one car model
23-01-2021T16:14:17,BlueStreak98,"Then everything quit at once. Ignition, transmission, engine, all died simultaneously"
23-01-2021T16:14:19,CrRAR,A thrill to drive
23-01-2021T16:14:22,Glassan,"Isn't that how most tech is, though?"
23-01-2021T16:14:23,Roughlandin,"It's not a bug, it's a feature"
23-01-2021T16:14:23,Skornos,Just gone through the older comments and seen the part with the 1wk cooldown... Guess I should be honest enough to say that ye should ignore my newest suggestion then.
23-01-2021T16:14:28,NezumiYuki,Oh yeah... Pinto... Let's also not forget about early 80's Chevy stepside C1500 trucks.  The ones you DON'T WANT TO T-BONE
23-01-2021T16:14:30,CrRAR,but not for the normal reasons
23-01-2021T16:14:30,Glassan,Works great until it doesnt'

23-01-2021T16:16:07,Ordithus,"Tata Nano, spazz?"
23-01-2021T16:16:11,SpazztasticKiwi,it crushed like a soda can at 45 mph
23-01-2021T16:16:14,Roughlandin,"They put a metal screw on the PCIE riser for the GPU mount. If you over tighten it, it shorts itself and the plastic riser catches fire"
23-01-2021T16:16:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I think that was it
23-01-2021T16:16:27,NezumiYuki,Wait nano?  why does that name sound familiar?
23-01-2021T16:16:35,SpazztasticKiwi,the other car was more or less unharmed
23-01-2021T16:16:39,Ordithus,"World's cheapest car. Cost something like $5K or less, new."
23-01-2021T16:16:49,NezumiYuki,OH.... that nano
23-01-2021T16:16:51,Roughlandin,Think it was like 2-3k
23-01-2021T16:16:53,BlueStreak98,"Tata now owns Jaguar and Land Rover. The irony, an Indian company owning something British."
23-01-2021T16:17:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I don't think I paid 5k for any of my cars
23-01-2021T16:17:04,NezumiYuki,LOL Blue

23-01-2021T16:39:13,CrimsonQuill,Ooh is there a new page?
23-01-2021T16:39:16,Ordithus,yikes
23-01-2021T16:39:22,Roughlandin,Kat is brutal
23-01-2021T16:39:35,BlueStreak98,I think Sythe manages to get one off on Rom or Rem in this whole debacle
23-01-2021T16:39:39,Ordithus,"a few days ago, yeah, quill"
23-01-2021T16:39:52,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, I thought there was one with Kat in it"
23-01-2021T16:40:00,ThingsAreMoving,Not yet
23-01-2021T16:40:04,CrimsonQuill,'cos you were all talkin' 'bout Kat v Rom and Rem
23-01-2021T16:40:11,Roughlandin,"I'm telling you, Nibbs is due for a glorious return. We haven't seen her since Sythen and Maren slipped off together"
23-01-2021T16:40:11,ThingsAreMoving,Hopefully she's hiding somewhere
23-01-2021T16:40:16,CrimsonQuill,Last page I recall is Value of Brutus
23-01-2021T16:40:24,Ordithus,that is the most recent yes yes
23-01-2021T16:40:25,NezumiYuki,"But what if in the process of all that sewing... who's to say Kats doesn't accidentally Rom and Rem's eyes, mouth, nose shut too?   Brutal but considering her skills, most effective"
23-01-2021T16:40:28,Glassan,I think it would be interesting to see Sythe get an action scene to show some hidden bada** qualities.
23-01-2021T16:40:30,Skornos,@ThingsAreMoving Was that some kind of reference?
23-01-2021T16:40:32,ProsePro7,That was the last one
23-01-2021T16:40:38,SpaceCadety,"I think they'll get intercepted before they get to Zen while trying to off Sythe, possibly by Nibbly."
23-01-2021T16:40:39,CrimsonQuill,yup
23-01-2021T16:40:50,Roughlandin,Nibbs is gonna splat a doggo
23-01-2021T16:40:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Still want to see Rom and Rem do the fusion dance
23-01-2021T16:41:13,Roughlandin,Into Remulus or Romus?
23-01-2021T16:41:13,ThingsAreMoving,"Skornos, there was this one episode of Fringe TV show where people's holes grew shut but that's about it."
23-01-2021T16:41:14,Glassan,Nibbs gonna bap em with the newspaper.
23-01-2021T16:41:16,ProsePro7,It just makes sense to me that Kat uses magic since it is what she has been studying for a while
23-01-2021T16:41:39,TeapotOfDoom,oh hello
23-01-2021T16:41:41,TeapotOfDoom,how goes
23-01-2021T16:41:41,SpaceCadety,"I think Nibbs best bet is to summon backup.  Like say, an angry dragon."
23-01-2021T16:41:46,TeapotOfDoom,i should change my pfp
23-01-2021T16:41:48,Roughlandin,Kat spills soup. Rom/Rem slips on it and falls out the window
