20-03-2021T01:31:10,Failedspells101,I guess there won't be an omnipoll this time around.
20-03-2021T01:31:52,Dadrobit,Omnipolls are kinda rare
20-03-2021T01:38:22,Failedspells101,":slight_frown: I rarely get to vote on more than 2 pics with the normal voting due to the timezone difference, for me it's 10 pm when the stream is supposed to start. but at least with the summer/winter time shift thing it's 9 pm for me for this time."
20-03-2021T01:49:29,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I like omnipolls as well. I'm often working on things on the weekend and don't get to vote a lot likr that either."

20-03-2021T16:19:05,ProsePro7,Tom doesnt like ref sheets too much work

20-03-2021T16:19:10,ProsePro7,HAHA
20-03-2021T16:19:24,Sammit,Hi Things and Hogan
20-03-2021T16:19:25,ThingsAreMoving,We could complete ref sheets for the main cast so that Tom can update the character info page and forget about them
20-03-2021T16:19:34,Majyxs,"Bold Reni, Keiren does a double take while barking at the recruits."
20-03-2021T16:19:44,Akadu,Tom should just do a chalk outline for Remus' ref sheet.
20-03-2021T16:19:47,ProsePro7,Who among the main crew doesnt have a ref sheet?
20-03-2021T16:19:52,KeefMcDerpface,"lol, Akadu"

20-03-2021T16:25:13,Roughlandin,Don't tell her I said this... but the lifeguard's kinda cute.
20-03-2021T16:25:16,CrimsonQuill086,Hiya Lunar and Palmetto!
20-03-2021T16:25:22,ThingsAreMoving,"Palmetto, I think ref sheets for the main cast are still ok, but side characters with like... 3 pages in the comic is pushing it a bit"
20-03-2021T16:25:30,CrimsonQuill086,tells Reni that Rough thinks she's kinda cute
20-03-2021T16:25:33,McClaw,Tell her it's cute. She'll blush and be even more cute.
20-03-2021T16:25:46,Roughlandin,No! I'll get banned from bear swim hours!

20-03-2021T16:26:03,PalmettoPathfinder1,@ThingsAreMoving I was also thinking about a ref sheet for Alaric.  He was a side character yes but he was still important to the story and plot.
20-03-2021T16:26:16,PalmettoPathfinder1,And yeah I know he's dead and all.
20-03-2021T16:26:26,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-karenOOO:
20-03-2021T16:26:28,ThingsAreMoving,I think that would be more acceptable than Remus and that other wolf
20-03-2021T16:26:35,Roughlandin,Remus and Bob
20-03-2021T16:26:40,KeefMcDerpface,lol
20-03-2021T16:26:58,PalmettoPathfinder1,@ThingsAreMoving @Roughlandin I still love their asymmetrical fur patterns though.  That was such a great idea there.
20-03-2021T16:27:22,Xaveourgaming,Alaric is extremely important to Kieth's character development
20-03-2021T16:27:25,PalmettoPathfinder1,"A shame that they have been killed off (well Remus anyhow, but still Tom might pull a fast one on us)."
20-03-2021T16:27:36,ThingsAreMoving,"But still, I'd expand it to the three generals in one ref sheet so that we could get a bit broader info. Remember that Tom has to come up with something to put there."
20-03-2021T16:27:47,Roughlandin,Their design is really cool. I'm just happy we got one sketch of Rem before he... y'know
20-03-2021T16:28:15,CrRAR,"long drop, sudden stop"
20-03-2021T16:28:22,PalmettoPathfinder1,@Roughlandin For some reason I want to suggest a sketch of them genderbent like what happened to Brutus and Clovis's reaction.  :D

20-03-2021T16:29:02,PalmettoPathfinder1,"@ThingsAreMoving that's true.  Although, Alaric might deserve a ref sheet by his himself and maybe put the other two on one ref sheet."

20-03-2021T16:42:56,Twokinds,Maybe? I dunno

20-03-2021T16:59:10,ThingsAreMoving,More likely an animated series
20-03-2021T16:59:14,BaskervilleNQH,It would probably have to be a side story about something else.
20-03-2021T16:59:14,GammaEradon,It's a bit too serialized. Maybe an ongoing series

20-03-2021T18:35:50,ThingsAreMoving,Sounds like you could use a critter kill lamp
20-03-2021T18:35:50,BaskervilleNQH,They probably have a mobile spawn point close by.
20-03-2021T18:35:50,CrRAR,oh no

20-03-2021T18:36:18,Twokinds,Something that only lets air through but nothing else.

20-03-2021T18:36:25,Roughlandin,Time for a bug hunt. *Cocks spraycan.*
20-03-2021T18:36:28,microbuss,Anthrocon is cancelled!
20-03-2021T18:36:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Then they get the zoomies in spring and fall

20-03-2021T18:36:40,Avolendi,Otherwise you could try to layer 2 screens over each other with a half offset?
20-03-2021T18:36:42,ShamusTheFox,Although it is currently 70 degrees here. I never would have expected it.
20-03-2021T18:36:43,JourneymanIK,Had to dodge wasps already. It's greeeeeeat. *sarcasm*
20-03-2021T18:36:47,Roughlandin,Wasn't it already canceled Micro?
20-03-2021T18:36:49,Twokinds,"Those foam filter screens, like that go in air purifiers. But for a window."
20-03-2021T18:36:54,steelabjur,"When it gets cold around here, the bugs try to come in. :p"
20-03-2021T18:36:59,OmniOtter,Just try and not keep any food out for too long.
20-03-2021T18:37:04,ThingsAreMoving,You could try wiping the window frames with eucapyptus essential oil. It damages bug's breathing apparatus and they actively avoid it
20-03-2021T18:37:04,Roughlandin,All the perks of a window without all that pesky light
20-03-2021T18:37:06,ProsePro7,Screens not doing it?

20-03-2021T18:37:14,OmniOtter,probably gnats

20-03-2021T18:37:25,CrRAR,maybe some sort of repellant on the screen
20-03-2021T18:37:32,Roughlandin,We call them no-see-ums around here
20-03-2021T18:37:35,Roughlandin,They suck

20-03-2021T18:37:49,OmniOtter,"i think some bug spray can be used as a  repellent, gotta spray the frames?"
20-03-2021T18:37:51,LunarSchnitzel,Could be a hole in the house too. Once a week I get a giant stink bug that finds my lamp. no way it could get through a screen so there's def a hole somewhere
20-03-2021T18:37:53,Twokinds,I don't want my room smelling like eucalyptus
20-03-2021T18:37:57,Redicide,give the bugs caffeine and theyll be so hyperactive they won't want to stay inside and want to play outside

20-03-2021T20:00:00,Roughlandin,She doesn't need to plan. Dragons just do that naturally

20-03-2021T23:12:19,SpazztasticKiwi,nothing is more confused than a thermostat in March in the south
20-03-2021T23:12:22,Ordithus,"refinance. no more mortgage insurance, lower rate"
20-03-2021T23:12:34,Roughlandin,That's cool too!
20-03-2021T23:12:46,Ordithus,I'll be using heat until July
20-03-2021T23:12:53,KeefMcDerpface,Oh gosh
20-03-2021T23:13:07,KeefMcDerpface,Where do you live again?
20-03-2021T23:13:08,Ordithus,my first day in this town was 40 degrees in June
20-03-2021T23:13:13,Roughlandin,I'm still flipping. Windows open during the day. Heat on at night
20-03-2021T23:13:13,Ordithus,Duluth
20-03-2021T23:13:25,KeefMcDerpface,same rought
20-03-2021T23:13:32,KeefMcDerpface,*Rough
20-03-2021T23:13:40,Ordithus,I'm not the only one!
20-03-2021T23:13:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"wake up, it’s warm"
20-03-2021T23:13:43,Ordithus,why does that happen
20-03-2021T23:13:55,Roughlandin,It's like desert weather I tell ya
20-03-2021T23:14:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"go home from work, cold as jack frosts ice cubes"
20-03-2021T23:15:20,Roughlandin,I either run the heat at night and wake up sweating or freeze all night and wake up to a decent temp
20-03-2021T23:15:56,Roughlandin,I wish my thermostat had a timer or schedule function or something
20-03-2021T23:16:15,Roughlandin,But it's like 20 years old and we're probably moving soon
20-03-2021T23:16:37,KeefMcDerpface,"Do you not have a timer or a ""turn off at this temperature"" setting?"
20-03-2021T23:16:50,Ordithus,a thermostat is more portable than you might think. and easy to replace
20-03-2021T23:17:25,Roughlandin,"It's got a temp limit setting, but I can either set it to heat, ac or off"
20-03-2021T23:17:33,KeefMcDerpface,oh
20-03-2021T23:17:44,KeefMcDerpface,"Well, shit."
20-03-2021T23:17:48,SpazztasticKiwi,pick your suffering
20-03-2021T23:17:53,KeefMcDerpface,yep
20-03-2021T23:18:10,Roughlandin,I can set it to whatever degree (usually 73
20-03-2021T23:18:36,Roughlandin,But that doesn't help when I have the heat on and the sun starts heating the room up above the bottom limit
20-03-2021T23:19:02,Roughlandin,"I'll wake up and it's 78 degrees upstair and the thermostat is like ""This is fine..."""
20-03-2021T23:19:18,Ordithus,close your blinds/curtains
20-03-2021T23:19:34,Snowmanwizard,"well, 530am comes quick, good night everyone"
20-03-2021T23:19:41,Ordithus,night snowman
20-03-2021T23:19:45,Roughlandin,Night Snowman
20-03-2021T23:19:48,KeefMcDerpface,night snowman
20-03-2021T23:20:52,Roughlandin,"I do keep them closed most of the time. The HVAC system in my house is borked. My room sits next to our living room, which is two stories tall and has awful ventilation"
20-03-2021T23:21:07,Roughlandin,So right next to my head is a big ball of stagnant hot air all the time
20-03-2021T23:21:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a heated blankie
20-03-2021T23:21:42,SpazztasticKiwi,doesn’t matter if I turn the heat on for the night or not
20-03-2021T23:21:47,SpazztasticKiwi,problem solved
20-03-2021T23:22:04,Roughlandin,I've been leaving the heater super low and wearing thermal socks at night lol
20-03-2021T23:22:20,Roughlandin,It actually really helps
20-03-2021T23:23:41,Roughlandin,In other news.... It's spring and a really want to go do spring stuff but I also need to wait for all my friends to get vaccinated. Grrr....
20-03-2021T23:23:59,Ordithus,soon!
20-03-2021T23:24:16,Roughlandin,Yep
20-03-2021T23:24:48,Roughlandin,Just sucks. Usually this time of year is all about Thunder over Louisville/Derby. But we can't do any of the fun stuff this year...
20-03-2021T23:24:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t know if I want to see a movie visit a museum go to a convention or roadtrip to the zoo
20-03-2021T23:25:09,Roughlandin,I want to do all those things
20-03-2021T23:25:26,SpazztasticKiwi,and if you can imagine all that said in one breath in under a minute that’s my mood
20-03-2021T23:26:05,Roughlandin,Usually around this time of year we have all kinds of awesome concerts at the waterfron leading up to the Kentucky Derby
20-03-2021T23:26:18,Roughlandin,This time of year is so awesome around Louisville
20-03-2021T23:26:50,Roughlandin,It's like a big fair every weekend
20-03-2021T23:27:49,Roughlandin,Then we have a giant airshow and fireworks display
20-03-2021T23:29:15,Roughlandin,*Sigh...* Hopefully next year
20-03-2021T23:29:40,SpazztasticKiwi,well winfield didn’t cancel mule day for this year
20-03-2021T23:29:50,SpazztasticKiwi,they confirmed its back on
20-03-2021T23:29:55,Roughlandin,Nice!
20-03-2021T23:30:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I usually work regardless
20-03-2021T23:30:20,Roughlandin,We're still having the Thunder air/fireworks show. But it's no crowds. Televised only
20-03-2021T23:30:48,Roughlandin,And Derby is still on but it's invitation only. Which means only the super rich celebrities get to go
20-03-2021T23:30:48,KeefMcDerpface,That's not too bad.
20-03-2021T23:31:00,Roughlandin,True
20-03-2021T23:31:45,Roughlandin,It's just. Agh! It's the atmosphere! Everybody's so happy! It's like a city-wide block party that lasts for a month
20-03-2021T23:32:20,Roughlandin,"If you ever want to come to Louisville, come during Derby season"
20-03-2021T23:32:37,Roughlandin,And let me know. We can do a tour of Bourbon row!
20-03-2021T23:36:47,Twokinds,:tumbler_glass:
20-03-2021T23:36:57,Roughlandin,Cheers!
20-03-2021T23:39:50,Roughlandin,"Oof, I'm probably gonna head to bed. Night Tom! Night everybody!"
