14-01-2021T16:23:33,SpazztasticKiwi,pay is very convincing when it‚Äôs good enough to lessen extra time over

14-01-2021T16:24:50,SpazztasticKiwi,we have two people today

14-01-2021T16:29:20,SpazztasticKiwi,one is off because covid & the other went home ‚Äúsick‚Äù
14-01-2021T16:29:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"ergo, only two people"
14-01-2021T16:31:22,CrRAR,"great, it really just makes employee relations tense, cuz everyone 1) either gets paranoid about someone being out or, 2) paranoid about being the perfect coworker"
14-01-2021T16:32:21,CrRAR,I can't believe departments can't cross-cover in a setup like that.
14-01-2021T16:32:34,CrRAR,but food service is its own game
14-01-2021T16:37:23,CrRAR,"dead weight supervisors is a crazy concept, our place as soon as the virus hit, proving how useful our off-site manager was... they just let him go"

14-01-2021T16:58:19,SpazztasticKiwi,not this year
14-01-2021T16:58:37,SpazztasticKiwi,not any year - begone satan
14-01-2021T17:07:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"but no, we‚Äôre having a bit of petty favoritism issue with the supervisor"
14-01-2021T17:08:06,SpazztasticKiwi,but so far nothing is provable

14-01-2021T18:28:41,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rose: weekend
14-01-2021T18:38:41,SpazztasticKiwi,our resident princess had a fit the other day because the person with her didn‚Äôt do the dryers for her after the rotisserie before she left because it got super busy
14-01-2021T18:38:50,SpazztasticKiwi,fryers
14-01-2021T18:39:09,SpazztasticKiwi,like I usually and have always done
14-01-2021T18:39:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"this isn‚Äôt the first time someone‚Äôs been surprised that all that isn‚Äôt the last shifts job, but the closers"
14-01-2021T18:40:38,SpazztasticKiwi,manager told me it sounds like I‚Äôm spoiling them by doing this work for them
14-01-2021T18:43:32,CrRAR,"yeah especially if it escalates, doing a favor is one thing"
14-01-2021T18:43:39,CrRAR,:ccrrar-katsip:
14-01-2021T18:44:11,SpazztasticKiwi,she‚Äôs becoming more and more spoiled
14-01-2021T18:44:25,SpazztasticKiwi,almost like she has someone up in the higher ranks for her...
14-01-2021T18:45:12,CrRAR,oh no
14-01-2021T18:45:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"but yeah, it‚Äôs got to be done & most of the time the person in charge of getting it done won‚Äôt if they can‚Äôt - whether it‚Äôs because they drag their feet or don‚Äôt want to do it"
14-01-2021T18:45:59,SpazztasticKiwi,so therefore I generally do it
14-01-2021T18:46:47,SpazztasticKiwi,manager asked me if I‚Äôd mind staying with the new person Wednesday - not that I have a choose due to scheduling through no fault of hers
14-01-2021T18:47:25,SpazztasticKiwi,she told the store manager she only wants me showing her the closing shift
14-01-2021T18:47:58,SpazztasticKiwi,and in response to your comment: oh yes
14-01-2021T18:48:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"but again, there is so far no impactful proof"
14-01-2021T18:50:42,SpazztasticKiwi,it does look like I‚Äôll be getting out when I‚Äôm due - they found someone to take the last 3 1/2 hours
14-01-2021T18:51:45,CrRAR,"eh, maybe it‚Äôll be a shortlived flash-in-the-pan, attitudes like that don‚Äôt last long, either they‚Äôll wear out their welcome or their own attention span"
14-01-2021T18:52:17,CrRAR,It‚Äôll be a spectacular show wagering which one before self-destruction
14-01-2021T18:52:30,SpazztasticKiwi,oh it‚Äôs safe to say this is how she is
14-01-2021T18:53:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"because she‚Äôs been called out on claiming she doesn‚Äôt know how to do something by someone who showed her, and her attitude and tone magically changed"
14-01-2021T18:53:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"if she asks a question & you answer and she doesn‚Äôt like the answer, you ‚Äúhave an attitude‚Äù"
14-01-2021T18:54:14,CrRAR,"Yeah, usually ‚Äúfavorites‚Äù get a shot somewhere people know them, ultimately because other places they worked hired-anonymously have been a catastrophe because of the same reasons"
14-01-2021T18:54:59,SpazztasticKiwi,oh she was hired through the store manager and other higher management
14-01-2021T18:55:09,SpazztasticKiwi,not any supervisor
14-01-2021T18:56:12,SpazztasticKiwi,the ENTIRE store - some certain employees in particular - have noticed there‚Äôs something mighty fishy how those two act around each other
14-01-2021T18:57:15,CrRAR,Yeah if uninamously everyone notices something maybe she‚Äôll be transferred or something
14-01-2021T18:57:33,SpazztasticKiwi,oh no
14-01-2021T18:57:36,CrRAR,The mysterious void of HR
14-01-2021T18:57:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"if something‚Äôs going  on, the supervisor is fired"
14-01-2021T18:57:53,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-power: ‚ÄúWe sent her... away‚Äù
14-01-2021T18:57:58,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs against company policy
14-01-2021T18:58:08,CrRAR,great
14-01-2021T18:58:52,CrRAR,"That‚Äôs why nepotism became taboo, even recommending a candidate is like a hushhush thing nowadays cuz of blame"
14-01-2021T18:59:47,CrRAR,"It used to be so much more like ‚ÄúI know a person‚Äù now it like ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say ya did, but didn‚Äôt‚Äù"
14-01-2021T19:00:28,CrRAR,but yeah shoehorning someone in who might otherwise be a problem isn‚Äôt good
14-01-2021T19:01:15,CrRAR,just cuz someone thinks someone deserves ‚Äúanother chance‚Äù
14-01-2021T19:01:36,CrRAR,:ptv-snicker:
14-01-2021T19:11:44,Ordithus,it's a great way of making yourself look bad
14-01-2021T19:12:34,CrRAR,"yeah, I mean if you can vouch for a good person and it works for everyone, that‚Äôs great"
14-01-2021T19:13:09,CrRAR,"the culture has change though to make it more like ‚Äúthanks, we‚Äôll be the judge of that‚Äù"
14-01-2021T19:13:23,Ordithus,best if there is only a contact made and any hiring is decided by someone else
14-01-2021T19:13:32,CrRAR,yeah
14-01-2021T19:14:28,Ordithus,that's how it works at my company - if there is any relation with someone you cannot be involved with hiring or supervising them
14-01-2021T19:14:47,CrRAR,Ah that makes sense
14-01-2021T19:14:59,CrRAR,avoids the conflicts of interest
14-01-2021T19:15:39,CrRAR,recommending I think has become a bit more understood
14-01-2021T19:15:47,CrRAR,our place does referral bonuses
14-01-2021T19:17:03,Ordithus,same
14-01-2021T19:17:30,CrRAR,hard to fill positions it helps when you provide impartial recommendations and can ensure good workplace match
14-01-2021T19:18:01,CrRAR,but now that everyone is incresingly work from home that doesn‚Äôt matter too much
14-01-2021T19:19:49,Ordithus,speaking of which
14-01-2021T19:19:59,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-Emberflail: getting a new desk Tues
14-01-2021T19:20:19,CrRAR,:ptv-sneakysmirk: nice
14-01-2021T19:22:44,CrRAR,but yeah you kinda miss the workplace interactions that break up the day
14-01-2021T19:23:06,Ordithus,"yeah, but I miss seeing friends outside of work much more"
14-01-2021T19:23:11,CrRAR,like spontaneous banter and such
14-01-2021T19:23:16,CrRAR,yeah tru
14-01-2021T19:23:29,CrRAR,all da time and nothing to do
14-01-2021T19:23:56,Ordithus,I'd enjoy working from home a lot more if it wasn't coupled with pandemic

14-01-2021T19:39:48,CrRAR,"Yeah they are pretty revolutionary, it can make a desk feel a little less ‚Äòcozy‚Äô though"

14-01-2021T21:12:17,Kynum,sup
14-01-2021T21:12:21,Ordithus,"It would be ""Was?"""
14-01-2021T21:12:24,Ordithus,Hi kynum

14-01-2021T21:12:28,ZapiliDver,Hi Kynum
14-01-2021T21:12:47,SageSaga,it shouldnt be said in general because we dont want people speaking other languages
14-01-2021T21:12:48,NezumiYuki,"Actually yes Ord, it would be ""Was"" and not Vas"
14-01-2021T21:12:55,Combak,"Nezumi, Lover did say ""Sporatic German."""
14-01-2021T21:13:13,Combak,"Oh, and hi Kynum."
14-01-2021T21:13:17,SageSaga,stick to English while you are here so everyone can understand
14-01-2021T21:13:44,TheSexyBeast,o7
14-01-2021T21:14:15,Combak,"Hey Sage, do you know what the Spanish word for ""No"" is?"
14-01-2021T21:14:21,NezumiYuki,Now I'm curious to see who Sage is drawing up all cute and stuff like this right now.  xD
14-01-2021T21:14:36,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-kingtea:
14-01-2021T21:14:50,ZapiliDver,:beer:
14-01-2021T21:15:03,CrRAR,\o/
14-01-2021T21:15:10,Rainelover,And this why i was in the middle of saying i was going to speak english for the rest of the stream
14-01-2021T21:15:15,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
14-01-2021T21:15:22,NezumiYuki,LOL Com... um... no... right?
14-01-2021T21:15:54,NezumiYuki,"I think I remember that Si is yes in Spanish, but kinda forgotten what no was...."
14-01-2021T21:16:01,Rainelover,Before I was distracted by out of context Ord
14-01-2021T21:16:19,Combak,"Shh Nezumi, let Sage answer, preferably with a single word."
14-01-2021T21:16:30,NezumiYuki,"okey doke then, Com"
14-01-2021T21:16:33,NezumiYuki,xD
14-01-2021T21:16:40,SageSaga,its too late combak - the joke was ruined
14-01-2021T21:16:50,Combak,I figured. :(
14-01-2021T21:17:02,NezumiYuki,as per usual... I ruin everything...
14-01-2021T21:17:17,NezumiYuki,Skavens are always blamed for ruining everything.... sigh*
14-01-2021T21:17:37,Combak,"Eh, it was you, the next smart alec, or Sage just answering with ""I do not."""
14-01-2021T21:17:52,TheSexyBeast,Wasn't Picarto supposed to have installed new servers by now?
14-01-2021T21:18:00,NezumiYuki,I think?
14-01-2021T21:18:12,ZapiliDver,Got slideshow instead of stream?
14-01-2021T21:18:14,Rainelover,"I just now realized the joke, and then started laughing my ass off"
14-01-2021T21:18:18,SageSaga,except that would be lying combak- i did take 3 years of spanish- though only 1 counted really-
14-01-2021T21:19:11,Ordithus,I took 4 years of german
14-01-2021T21:19:15,SageSaga,"because i had real spanish 1, fake spanish 2 - it was more about how my teacher almost banged Natalie Portman"
14-01-2021T21:19:22,Combak,"Okay, then answering with, ""Yes, it's ""No."""""
14-01-2021T21:19:32,Ordithus,that is unfortunate
14-01-2021T21:19:47,SageSaga,"and my third year was a lot of ""are you sure you took spanish 2?"" ""Yes- my teacher tried to bang Natalie Portman"""
14-01-2021T21:20:15,NezumiYuki,LOL Sage
14-01-2021T21:20:21,SageSaga,im not even kidding
14-01-2021T21:20:30,NezumiYuki,O.o oooo spicy

14-01-2021T21:20:38,NezumiYuki,aww
14-01-2021T21:20:44,Kynum,pity is pretty useful
14-01-2021T21:20:45,Ordithus,a damn waste
14-01-2021T21:21:10,SageSaga,few years ago i heard from my old Spanish teacher- 1 and 3
14-01-2021T21:21:14,Ordithus,supposedly in year 5 of german we were supposed to be fluent
14-01-2021T21:21:17,Ordithus,I have my doubts
14-01-2021T21:21:26,Rainelover,I think this the hardest ive laughed besides dbz abridged
14-01-2021T21:21:34,SageSaga,"and she said ""We still use the Santa you drew for the christmas door decoration!"
14-01-2021T21:21:43,Combak,"Aww, that's awesome1"
14-01-2021T21:21:47,Kynum,lol! I remember this story x3

14-01-2021T21:22:21,SageSaga,wonder if thats why i passed-
14-01-2021T21:22:22,SageSaga,XD
14-01-2021T21:22:32,Kynum,"ok, but was it a Nekomimi Santa?"
14-01-2021T21:22:52,SageSaga,nah but he was 6 feet tall
14-01-2021T21:22:57,Kynum,damn shame.
14-01-2021T21:23:20,Combak,... Are you cocking a shotgun while saying that?
14-01-2021T21:23:28,Kynum,x3
14-01-2021T21:25:04,NezumiYuki,@Kynum... Mosberg or Remington?  :3
14-01-2021T21:25:17,Rainelover,You people are going to kill me with laughter before tom even gets here goddamnit
14-01-2021T21:25:32,NezumiYuki,"Hang in there, Raine! :D"
14-01-2021T21:25:47,Ordithus,at least you'll die happy
14-01-2021T21:26:12,SageSaga,"""Teacher? What student drew the santa?"" ""Oh hes a student who went on to be a professional artist!"" ""Wow! What does he do?"" ""Oh he draws comics!"" ""Woooow!"" ""Mostly women with huge breasts"" ""WOOOOOWWW!"""
14-01-2021T21:27:01,Ordithus,"speaking of which, Monday's Yosh"

14-01-2021T21:27:47,Combak,"Ooh, whatcha doing there Ron?"
14-01-2021T21:28:02,NezumiYuki,"Looks like hair curls, maybe?"
14-01-2021T21:28:31,NezumiYuki,"That's either hair curls, or a really bent guard rail...  xD"
14-01-2021T21:29:32,NezumiYuki,"Boolean some stuff, huh Ron?"
14-01-2021T21:30:07,Combak,"Also, evidently the reference from one of my last comments is just ""Shame"" instead of ""Damn shame."" Drat."
14-01-2021T21:30:29,Combak,... It almost looks like a car logo now.
14-01-2021T21:30:51,Rainelover,"Goddamnit, you aren't helping either nezumi XD"

14-01-2021T21:47:35,ZapiliDver,"Try DnD, they told me, that will make some fun and don't take a lot of time, they lold me...."

14-01-2021T21:48:15,NezumiYuki,"What exactly are we making, Ron?"
14-01-2021T21:48:29,NezumiYuki,Kinda looks like some flower planter but... oh
14-01-2021T21:48:31,ZapiliDver,"Hmmm, 19D20 rolled"
14-01-2021T21:48:46,ZapiliDver,Critical hit!
14-01-2021T21:49:22,Rainelover,"Ok, never mind, they are d&d jokes"
14-01-2021T21:49:32,SageSaga,D&D is the best game ever
14-01-2021T21:49:59,Kynum,I concur
14-01-2021T21:50:04,ZapiliDver,"Anyway, i've played a lot of HoMM III on XL maps with 4 friends for a lot of time, so i're prepared for that =)"
14-01-2021T21:50:06,Kynum,"though, I started with D20 Modern."

14-01-2021T21:50:52,NezumiYuki,Sleepy Nyna is adorable on that tree limb
14-01-2021T21:51:00,SageSaga,i started with D&D Advanced but i wasnt allowed to make my own character until 3rd Ed!
14-01-2021T21:51:16,Tharkis,all nyna is adorable !
14-01-2021T21:51:17,Kynum,you weren't allowed?
14-01-2021T21:51:23,SageSaga,and i died in the first room of the first round of combat
14-01-2021T21:51:37,Kynum,I've never even looked at any D&D before 3.5E
14-01-2021T21:51:42,Ordithus,"hey, at least you got practice at making characters \o/"
14-01-2021T21:51:43,SageSaga,the DM only allowed premade characters
14-01-2021T21:51:50,ZapiliDver,Hehehe
14-01-2021T21:51:53,SageSaga,and i was a young'n
14-01-2021T21:51:57,Kynum,hm
14-01-2021T21:52:10,Ordithus,I didn't start dnd until 5th
14-01-2021T21:52:28,Kynum,was AC that weird system back then where lower number was better?
14-01-2021T21:52:38,SageSaga,THAC0!

14-01-2021T21:52:47,SageSaga,To Hit Armor Class 0!
14-01-2021T21:53:28,SageSaga,they only really let me play because i had played Baldurs gate so i knew enough about it
14-01-2021T21:53:30,Rainelover,"My friend asked me to come up with a name for a dnd character he was making, and all i could come up with was ""Bismarian the death bringer eternal"""
14-01-2021T21:53:39,SageSaga,they didnt wanna teach a little kid how to play their adult game
14-01-2021T21:53:59,Ordithus,little did they know~
14-01-2021T21:54:07,Kynum,"I tried, recently, to play the Baldur's Gate pc game"
14-01-2021T21:54:11,Kynum,it was...
14-01-2021T21:54:15,ZapiliDver,cool
14-01-2021T21:54:18,Kynum,difficult
14-01-2021T21:54:36,ZapiliDver,no 'Press X to win' =)
14-01-2021T21:54:46,Kynum,dang.
14-01-2021T21:54:52,Kynum,I mapped that button to doubt...
14-01-2021T21:55:04,Kynum,guess I'll never win.

14-01-2021T21:56:19,SageSaga,ive made 51 character- and i plan to make many more O_O
14-01-2021T21:56:35,Kynum,"wait, 51 characters since when?"

14-01-2021T21:57:04,ZapiliDver,"Uhhh, did you try somethings ligter? Some forbidden drugs maybe =) ?"

14-01-2021T21:57:38,SageSaga,behold- Grunger the Grung
14-01-2021T21:57:43,Ordithus,THOSE STATS
14-01-2021T21:57:57,ZapiliDver,"Eww, how much time do you spend in DnD? 51 chars is really extreme"
14-01-2021T21:57:58,SageSaga,*allowing people to roll for stats was a mistake*
14-01-2021T21:58:18,Ordithus,yet 25 ft speed
14-01-2021T21:58:23,Ordithus,"well, default"
14-01-2021T21:58:29,Kynum,"sees 10 10 9 and whatnot, thinking those weren't the MODS"
14-01-2021T21:58:41,Kynum,And then I see the actual scores x3
14-01-2021T21:58:47,Kynum,holy god.
14-01-2021T21:59:10,SageSaga,this was testing for a special campaign i plan to run with friends XD
14-01-2021T21:59:46,Ordithus,"we recently had a one-off dungeon, level 7 characters, rolled stats"
14-01-2021T21:59:55,Ordithus,I started with 18 CON
14-01-2021T22:00:08,SageSaga,this guy is design to grapple people and poison them to death- and if that doesnt work - he can turn into a elemental- and grapple them to death XD
14-01-2021T22:00:16,Kynum,I have a bad habit of making con my dump-stat
14-01-2021T22:00:31,BadFoMo,Is @Nekonny not loading for anyone else?
14-01-2021T22:00:39,AspiringNoodle,\o
14-01-2021T22:00:42,NezumiYuki,for me he is :(
14-01-2021T22:00:48,Ordithus,his stream got very choppy for me
14-01-2021T22:00:50,SageSaga,Ron is showing on mine but its slideshowing
14-01-2021T22:01:01,ZRO4825,^ what Sage said
14-01-2021T22:01:01,ZapiliDver,@Nekonny stream is dead
14-01-2021T22:01:10,Kynum,"yeah, that"
14-01-2021T22:01:26,Ordithus,"so you are familiar with making new characters, ky?"
14-01-2021T22:01:27,BadFoMo,There he is.
14-01-2021T22:01:33,NezumiYuki,I did an F5 and looks like Ron is back to normal
14-01-2021T22:01:35,Kynum,I suppose
14-01-2021T22:01:50,Nekonny,that bad huh?
14-01-2021T22:01:59,Ordithus,better again
14-01-2021T22:02:03,Nekonny,"have a few dropped frames,not sure why"
14-01-2021T22:02:21,ZapiliDver,"YEah, now hear 20FPS"
14-01-2021T22:02:36,Kynum,I've made many characters using many systems. But I've never felt like I know everything well enough to be able to envision whatever I wanted.
14-01-2021T22:02:42,NezumiYuki,"Well don't worry too much about it, Ron. You're still with us. You're not dropped completely."
14-01-2021T22:02:45,ZapiliDver,few minutes ago that was a static picture
14-01-2021T22:02:52,SageSaga,whoops- saved it as a PNG at 100%
14-01-2021T22:03:34,Ordithus,"what is that this column is from, Ron?"
14-01-2021T22:04:03,Kynum,maybe it's an ATAT leg.
14-01-2021T22:04:22,NezumiYuki,Kinda looked like Big Daddy from BioShock
14-01-2021T22:04:31,NezumiYuki,Well some sort of mech anyway

14-01-2021T23:01:05,Nekonny,thats what I'm thinking
14-01-2021T23:01:12,Nekonny,I just needed to isolate the pattern
14-01-2021T23:02:43,SageSaga,im saying i would have traced a larger section- then used that to isolate and crop it out
14-01-2021T23:03:03,Nekonny,its what I did
14-01-2021T23:03:08,SageSaga,no its not
14-01-2021T23:03:11,Nekonny,no?
14-01-2021T23:03:22,SageSaga,you didnt trace it out already at all
14-01-2021T23:03:31,SageSaga,so no- its not at all what you did
14-01-2021T23:03:38,Nekonny,oh
14-01-2021T23:03:49,Nekonny,Its because I havent decided yet

14-01-2021T23:04:04,SageSaga,i dont know why you use these weird excuses
14-01-2021T23:06:03,SageSaga,its ok to do things different - i just think the way i would do it would have been faster and produce the same result
14-01-2021T23:06:06,Nekonny,its not an excuse
14-01-2021T23:06:10,SageSaga,. . .
14-01-2021T23:06:16,Nekonny,I just didn't understand what you had said
14-01-2021T23:06:36,SageSaga,you then made the excuse that you did it this way and not my way because you hadnt decided yet
14-01-2021T23:06:41,SageSaga,thats an excuse
14-01-2021T23:07:11,Nekonny,once I got what you were saying
14-01-2021T23:08:07,SageSaga,oi - its impossible to discuss this kinda stuff with you. Its like you were raised with an alternate dictionary and words dont mean the same thing anymore
14-01-2021T23:09:22,SageSaga,""""
14-01-2021T23:09:40,SageSaga,"""Im not making an excuse- im giving a reason to justify an action"""
14-01-2021T23:10:11,Nekonny,^_^ '
14-01-2021T23:11:37,Nekonny,I probably still disn't understand your sugestion
14-01-2021T23:11:53,SageSaga,XD
14-01-2021T23:11:54,Nekonny,wouldn't have tracing more been more work?
14-01-2021T23:12:18,SageSaga,not for me- is what i was getting at- tracing it out would be a big part of what i do every day
14-01-2021T23:12:27,SageSaga,tracing stuff for me is easy- i would think you too
14-01-2021T23:13:13,SageSaga,also since its all so uniform - all the lines are the same size- you could snap grip it really easy too
14-01-2021T23:13:46,SageSaga,and from there its just tracing with a selection tool and filling it in - or using shape tools
14-01-2021T23:14:06,NezumiYuki,Shapes would probably be fastest.
14-01-2021T23:14:19,NezumiYuki,Ron could scale the shapes any which way he would need to get it right
14-01-2021T23:14:33,NezumiYuki,"then later combine into one, if he wished."
14-01-2021T23:14:36,SageSaga,he shouldnt need to scale em at all if he does a grid
14-01-2021T23:14:43,Nekonny,At first I was just going to pixel art it all
14-01-2021T23:14:47,SageSaga,everything should just line up perfectly
14-01-2021T23:14:48,Nekonny,and stretch it out
14-01-2021T23:14:54,Nekonny,but I see that there are textures
14-01-2021T23:15:01,Nekonny,so no I'm unsure what is the best path
14-01-2021T23:15:16,SageSaga,tbh first thing i would have done is look up online to see if that texture is already out there XD
14-01-2021T23:15:22,Nekonny,I don't think I know how o use shapes in photoshop
14-01-2021T23:15:23,SageSaga,its probably not an uncommon design
14-01-2021T23:15:35,Nekonny,it's a odd pattern
14-01-2021T23:15:48,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-natsducky: backsies
14-01-2021T23:15:54,NezumiYuki,wb ord
14-01-2021T23:16:14,SageSaga,ive seen it before Ron- and ive never seen that video you are getting it from XD
14-01-2021T23:16:29,CrRAR,wb
14-01-2021T23:17:02,Combak,"So, I've been a bit distracted by stuff... Will Tom be joining us tonight?"
14-01-2021T23:19:23,SageSaga,"lol i thought i found it for a sec but i was like ""Wait- no- this one has little swastikas... yikes"" XD"
14-01-2021T23:19:55,Nekonny,you want to see the pattern from the video still?
14-01-2021T23:20:29,SageSaga,yeah ive seen this pattern before for sure
14-01-2021T23:20:38,Nekonny,not me
14-01-2021T23:20:43,NezumiYuki,Ummm I don't think Ron could use tiles that are little bent X's...  Folks would get bent out of shape with bent X's.
14-01-2021T23:21:23,ZRO4825,"But if you bend the straight lines you get curves, and curves are great. :D"
14-01-2021T23:21:46,NezumiYuki,"Okay yes, curves are good, but bent X's aren't.  xD"
14-01-2021T23:22:03,SageSaga,think i found it- but its got water marks- and doesnt have the little breaks
14-01-2021T23:22:10,NezumiYuki,"Especially Bent X's that begin with the letter ""S"""
14-01-2021T23:22:14,Nekonny,oh?
14-01-2021T23:23:04,Nekonny,My current lockup is thta I'm trying to figure out if theres a way for me to just make this in blender without having to use a single texture for the whole thing
14-01-2021T23:23:12,SageSaga,yeah- if you google seamless geometrical patterns youll find tons of stuff that looks very close
14-01-2021T23:23:12,Nekonny,link?
14-01-2021T23:25:33,TheSexyBeast,"My Great Grandpa and Grandma had a Navajo blanket they bought in the 1920's, and it had a reverse bent X in the design. It was supposed to mean good luck or something."
14-01-2021T23:26:56,Combak,"Yeah, Hitler just ruined it."
14-01-2021T23:27:18,TheSexyBeast,Hitler ruins everything.
14-01-2021T23:27:36,SpazztasticKiwi,what
14-01-2021T23:27:44,SpazztasticKiwi,did I just come across
14-01-2021T23:27:56,NezumiYuki,"The swastika really was a religious symbol, but the Naz party ruined it for everyone... along with pretty much everything else..."
14-01-2021T23:29:23,SageSaga,it was used by a ton of ancient cultures
14-01-2021T23:29:30,SageSaga,and now it just means evil
14-01-2021T23:29:44,NezumiYuki,sad and now true
14-01-2021T23:31:55,TheSexyBeast,And they probably can never be reclaimed
14-01-2021T23:33:58,SageSaga,and besides- who would reclaim it? it's largest sect or original users are mostly long since gone
14-01-2021T23:36:41,CrRAR,believe it or not there are some freaky swastika looking patterns on some chairs of the US capital houses.
14-01-2021T23:36:55,CrRAR,noticed em during one of the last few state of the unions
14-01-2021T23:37:05,CrRAR,see here: https://i.ytimg.com/vi/okUoZGeIv70/maxresdefault.jpg xD
14-01-2021T23:37:11,Twokinds,I dunno about never. Never's a long time.
14-01-2021T23:37:57,SageSaga,lol CR thats the geometric pattern i found with them XD
14-01-2021T23:38:10,CrRAR,"the blue and gold bits that are visible, yeah tis weird"
14-01-2021T23:38:37,AspiringNoodle,I *think* the swastika originated from India?
14-01-2021T23:38:40,AspiringNoodle,Don't quote me on that
14-01-2021T23:39:05,CrRAR,yeah it originally means like friendship or unity or something like that
14-01-2021T23:39:22,Ordithus,it's also the layout of dungeon 3 in the original zelda
14-01-2021T23:39:24,SageSaga,India is the oldest known use of it and where we get the name from
14-01-2021T23:39:30,AspiringNoodle,"Fairly certain, at the least, that it existed in Asia for a long time before certain unmentionables ruined it 80+ years ago"
14-01-2021T23:39:50,SageSaga,. . . India is in Asia
14-01-2021T23:40:02,CrRAR,haha
14-01-2021T23:40:03,AspiringNoodle,"yes, but I'm being broader :p"
14-01-2021T23:40:20,Ordithus,I 'member seeing a pictograph of a similar symbol in the american southwest
14-01-2021T23:40:42,SageSaga,it used to be used on signs in Arizona
14-01-2021T23:40:54,Ordithus,yeah!
14-01-2021T23:41:40,SageSaga,that had to do with- as someone already said - the Navajos
14-01-2021T23:41:48,CrRAR,yeah
14-01-2021T23:42:17,Twokinds,Well obviously. It's a really basic pattern.
14-01-2021T23:42:29,CrRAR,lotsa angular symbology
14-01-2021T23:42:38,AspiringNoodle,g e o m e t r i c a l
14-01-2021T23:42:51,Twokinds,While creativing my hedgemaze I literally had to go out of my way to avoid four paths ending in the same pattern.
14-01-2021T23:43:04,CrRAR,haha
14-01-2021T23:43:14,Ordithus,hard to avoid with right angles I imagine
14-01-2021T23:43:21,Ordithus,silly minecraft
14-01-2021T23:43:26,CrRAR,"just use left angles, duh"
14-01-2021T23:43:28,SageSaga,XD
14-01-2021T23:43:58,SageSaga,i just imagine you spend all that time making sure it has no swastikas and then you fly way above it to check it out- and it looks like a portrait of hitler
14-01-2021T23:44:05,AspiringNoodle,O_O
14-01-2021T23:44:08,Twokinds,hahaha
14-01-2021T23:44:09,AspiringNoodle,*mind explodes*
14-01-2021T23:44:10,NezumiYuki,Wouldn't it be best to use a mix of left AND right angles?   xD
14-01-2021T23:44:11,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
14-01-2021T23:44:17,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-power: burn it all
14-01-2021T23:45:21,CrRAR,task failed swastastically
14-01-2021T23:45:56,ZRO4825,"Eh, swastikas ain't that bad. Just sad that Hitler ruined them when buddhism used'em first."
14-01-2021T23:46:04,NezumiYuki,the puns are getting dangerous here.....
14-01-2021T23:46:47,SageSaga,Zro
14-01-2021T23:46:57,ZRO4825,Hm?
14-01-2021T23:46:57,SageSaga,thats like the past 20 minute conversation
14-01-2021T23:47:18,ZRO4825,And? I just came back from unfortunately being AFK for 'bout that long. o.O
14-01-2021T23:47:42,SageSaga,i get ya- its just- funny XD

14-01-2021T23:48:36,Nekonny,I'm wondering how I can best make use of those textures
14-01-2021T23:48:38,SageSaga,brb gonna grab food
14-01-2021T23:48:43,CrRAR,alrighty
14-01-2021T23:48:51,Ordithus,enjoy!
14-01-2021T23:49:01,NezumiYuki,Think I might do a Sage... Grabbin a nibble
14-01-2021T23:49:18,CrRAR,yup
14-01-2021T23:50:08,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-power:

14-01-2021T23:52:00,CrRAR,cinnamon probably more chill

14-01-2021T23:52:23,AspiringNoodle,I pray for my insides later this month
14-01-2021T23:52:24,ZRO4825,Cinnamon has no chill. She is least chill neko.
14-01-2021T23:52:24,NezumiYuki,*Grabs Nibbly while nuking a burrito*   Pets Nibbly too*
14-01-2021T23:52:36,NezumiYuki,Nibbly is for huggles <3
14-01-2021T23:55:16,NezumiYuki,Back with nibbles and hugging Nibbly at the same time*
14-01-2021T23:57:38,CrRAR,at least she'll have a hard time stealing peoples clothes being preoccupied with the huggles
14-01-2021T23:58:41,NezumiYuki,"Hah... I don't think huggles would be much of a deterrent... Once I let her go, she'll probably just resume her rampage of clothing theft.  xD"
14-01-2021T23:59:26,CrRAR,"yeah, it will only served to embolden her efforts"
14-01-2021T23:59:34,CrRAR,gotta make up for lost time
14-01-2021T23:59:34,NezumiYuki,^ THIS
14-01-2021T23:59:40,CrRAR,haha
