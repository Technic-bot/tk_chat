25-02-2021T00:01:44,CrRAR,"yeah, any driving job will quickly expose weaknesses"
25-02-2021T00:02:31,CrRAR,"got an uncle that's a courier, he just buys $3000 cars and runs em into the ground"
25-02-2021T00:03:27,CrRAR,like they probably come with 80000 or 100000 miles he just has a mechanic patch em together for like another 50000 miles or something
25-02-2021T00:03:56,AspiringNoodle,"My Focus came with 93k or so miles, currently at 103k"
25-02-2021T00:04:10,AspiringNoodle,"It's a '14, so it *should* last at least until 200k, hopefully"
25-02-2021T00:04:33,AspiringNoodle,But the bigger issue is that there's a design flaw with the dual-clutch automatic transmission.  It's a big enough deal that there were court cases and such.
25-02-2021T00:08:02,CrRAR,oh boy
25-02-2021T00:08:56,CrRAR,"yeah, all brands/models have an achellies heel"
25-02-2021T00:09:19,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-Saltyember: salt always wins
25-02-2021T00:09:30,AspiringNoodle,"In this one, it's increased wear and tear and potential failure to deliver power"
25-02-2021T00:09:37,CrRAR,some have a really lousy designed water pump buried under the engine so engine gotta come out to replace it
25-02-2021T00:09:52,AspiringNoodle,"When I first got this car, we got the transmission repaired within the first month while the dealer was covering half the costs"
25-02-2021T00:10:00,CrRAR,and water pumps are a common thing to go in high milage cars
25-02-2021T00:10:21,CrRAR,some I heard are driven on the TIMING belt
25-02-2021T00:10:29,AspiringNoodle,"The problem that prompted it was that sometimes the clutch wouldn't properly engage, so I'd hit the gas but power wouldn't be delivered until a second or two later."
25-02-2021T00:10:39,CrRAR,so like to service them the engine has to come apart
25-02-2021T00:10:47,CrRAR,ah
25-02-2021T00:10:52,AspiringNoodle,It's one of the downsides of cars becoming more compact
25-02-2021T00:11:23,AspiringNoodle,Older cars used to be much spacier.  And the lower-tech mechanical nature meant anyone could work on them if they had knowledge.  And you didn't have to disassemble the entire engine compartment to fix one small issue.
25-02-2021T00:11:28,CrRAR,yeah some new cars with 8-9 speed traditional transmissions like to lurch/kick at near stop
25-02-2021T00:11:49,CrRAR,it's one of those dumb design gaffs
25-02-2021T00:12:03,AspiringNoodle,"That's what my car does sometimes.  It's more of an issue on hills, but essentially it can't decide whether or not it wants to deliver power"
25-02-2021T00:12:25,AspiringNoodle,"My RPMs will be steady, but the car keeps switching between power on and power off.  Makes the climb very jerky"
25-02-2021T00:12:42,CrRAR,"yeah, it seems like they made things more complex and have a hard time packing the complexity into a small space"
25-02-2021T00:13:02,CrRAR,cuz I imagine 9 gears in a transmission gets crowded
25-02-2021T00:13:04,AspiringNoodle,I guess it shouldn't be too surprising.  This thing is a 6-speed automatic xD
25-02-2021T00:13:18,CrRAR,yeah esp in a focus sized car
25-02-2021T00:13:30,AspiringNoodle,But hot damn is that mileage sexy~
25-02-2021T00:13:34,CrRAR,yup
25-02-2021T00:13:41,AspiringNoodle,I averaged somewhere between 27 and 28 mpg my first day doing deliveries
25-02-2021T00:13:52,AspiringNoodle,I was hitting long stretches of road with no stop signs or red lights
25-02-2021T00:13:57,CrRAR,that's why CVTs were probably invented
25-02-2021T00:14:20,CrRAR,"simpler and achieve modulate ""gears"" better"
25-02-2021T00:14:24,AspiringNoodle,"Sadly, car companies don't have the balls to treat them like CVT's :|"
25-02-2021T00:14:36,CrRAR,very different drive feel though :c
25-02-2021T00:14:52,AspiringNoodle,The entire point of the CVT design is to achieve the optimal gear ratio depending on speed / rpm
25-02-2021T00:15:15,CrRAR,it's like two cones that just sorta slide around with a band/belt between them
25-02-2021T00:15:21,AspiringNoodle,But people are weirded out by that so they make them behave like they have a standard gear assembly.  Completely defeating the purpose!
25-02-2021T00:15:40,CrRAR,yup
25-02-2021T00:15:56,AspiringNoodle,"Man, if people don't like CVT's, they gonna hate it when EVs take over xD"
25-02-2021T00:16:27,CrRAR,"if there's ""steps"", you're missing out on the in-between adjustments too"
25-02-2021T00:17:06,CrRAR,yeah I think it's just because naturally or by habit people expect a shift to happen
25-02-2021T00:17:24,CrRAR,so you just sit there pressing the gas like
25-02-2021T00:17:29,CrRAR,:|
25-02-2021T00:17:38,CrRAR,*bvrrrrrrbttt*
25-02-2021T00:19:51,AspiringNoodle,"Ngl, gear shifting is fun"
25-02-2021T00:20:10,AspiringNoodle,But it's also inherently inefficient.
25-02-2021T00:20:58,AspiringNoodle,"Your most fuel efficient gear is generally gonna be one of the highway speed gears, and near the lowest maintainable rpm possible."

25-02-2021T22:30:00,SageSaga,now you gave people an open reason to do mean things- so long as its not to a person with a squirrel friend! Now everyone has to get a squirrel friend!

25-02-2021T23:32:24,Dadrobit,Lynn is busy fighting bureaucracy.
25-02-2021T23:32:27,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:
25-02-2021T23:32:32,Mediawatcher,Though I feel Romulus will soon be joining remus
25-02-2021T23:32:45,AkelaStormclaw,IMO Kat is gonna bean romulus with a frying pan or something
25-02-2021T23:32:50,Dadrobit,Also howdy y'all again!
25-02-2021T23:32:53,Mediawatcher,That‚Äôll do the trick
25-02-2021T23:32:54,CrRAR,dewwit
25-02-2021T23:32:56,AkelaStormclaw,"Like, stay away from my wolf"
25-02-2021T23:32:57,Mediawatcher,Hey robit!
25-02-2021T23:32:58,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-daydreamingkat:
25-02-2021T23:32:59,Ordithus,wb dad
25-02-2021T23:33:04,AkelaStormclaw,"Howdy, dad"
25-02-2021T23:33:07,CrRAR,yo daddio
25-02-2021T23:33:13,AspiringNoodle,hey dadro
25-02-2021T23:33:20,Mediawatcher,Nibbly and Kathrin: protecting the wolves they love
25-02-2021T23:33:48,Dadrobit,"App is being ass again, refuses to even open the home page. Gotta watch through Chrome."
25-02-2021T23:33:52,Ordithus,":ctwokinds-katwet:*[You just really remind me of Natani, okay? B-baka]"
25-02-2021T23:34:03,CrRAR,hehe
25-02-2021T23:34:12,AkelaStormclaw,hE
25-02-2021T23:34:13,SageSaga,"ive been thinking about answering the question ""What's your favorite anime?"" with ""Well, i cant choose between Monster, or Cat Planet Cuties"""
25-02-2021T23:34:27,Mediawatcher,I do really like cowboy bebop
25-02-2021T23:34:32,Dadrobit,Neo Yokio
25-02-2021T23:34:37,Twokinds,They're so similiar
25-02-2021T23:34:41,ZRO4825,Asobi Ni Iku Yo! ^_^
25-02-2021T23:34:42,SageSaga,exactly
25-02-2021T23:34:45,SageSaga,XD
25-02-2021T23:34:56,unsteddyphoenix,a toss up for sure
25-02-2021T23:35:05,unsteddyphoenix,monster is sooo good though
25-02-2021T23:35:06,Mediawatcher,Cat planet cuties is the same as a doctor trying to stop a heartless sociopath who wants to corrupt him?
25-02-2021T23:35:32,Mediawatcher,üòê
25-02-2021T23:35:37,SageSaga,"its like ""One is about a doctor that devotes his life to undoing the mistake of saving a serial killer- the other- is about a guy that has a bunch of hot alien catgirl chicks after his D along with 2 hot human girls-"""
25-02-2021T23:35:42,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,I have been enjoying the new season of Re:Zero
25-02-2021T23:35:48,Mediawatcher,Yup totally the same
25-02-2021T23:36:15,ZRO4825,I'm going with the catgirls personally.
25-02-2021T23:36:18,ZRO4825,Because catgirls. :eyes:
25-02-2021T23:36:27,Mediawatcher,I also got hooked on promised neverland then I heard about the second season
25-02-2021T23:36:29,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-FloDance:
25-02-2021T23:36:30,Mediawatcher,Yikes
25-02-2021T23:36:49,SageSaga,truth is- Cat Planet Cuties isnt anywhere close to my favorite anime- but i did really like it XD
25-02-2021T23:37:10,Ordithus,"but what -is- your favorite, then?"
25-02-2021T23:37:39,Mediawatcher,I think sage said monster
25-02-2021T23:37:42,Dadrobit,Chobits for sure
25-02-2021T23:37:44,SageSaga,"i dunno - i cant pick one - Monster, Berserk, ghost in the shell- those are some of my top picks- but then so much other stuff-"
25-02-2021T23:37:47,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,life is Sage's favorite Anime...
25-02-2021T23:37:59,Mediawatcher,Life is the worst anime of all time
25-02-2021T23:38:02,SageSaga,Chobits was pretty high up there too- though its not my favorite Clamp story
25-02-2021T23:38:12,Ordithus,mine is cowboy bebop. it's great! I also have not watched much anime
25-02-2021T23:38:21,ZRO4825,Card Captor Sakura is? :P
25-02-2021T23:38:26,SageSaga,:P
25-02-2021T23:38:27,Mediawatcher,I don‚Äôt watch that much anime but I have seen a few
25-02-2021T23:38:40,SageSaga,CCS is probably my favorite- though XXXHolic is amazing too
25-02-2021T23:38:41,Dadrobit,I actually only ever watched the first episode or two. But I did read the manga cover to cover.
25-02-2021T23:38:48,Mediawatcher,Beastars is a big one for me
25-02-2021T23:38:49,Ordithus,I just watched fullmetal alchemist: brotherhood. really enjoyed that
25-02-2021T23:39:06,SageSaga,FMA:B is great
25-02-2021T23:39:19,Mediawatcher,I need to get to finishing that one
25-02-2021T23:39:23,ZRO4825,Same
25-02-2021T23:39:34,Dadrobit,"Real talk though. Violet Evergarden made me bawl like a baby, so that's gotta be waaaaay up there for my fav."
25-02-2021T23:39:44,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,have you been watching the new season of RE;Zero Sage?
25-02-2021T23:39:46,Mediawatcher,Oh yeah that was also a really good one
25-02-2021T23:39:46,ZRO4825,I have a bad habit of starting big anime like that and never finishing them
25-02-2021T23:39:58,Mediawatcher,What a tear jerking yet heartfelt series
25-02-2021T23:39:58,AkelaStormclaw,"FMA:B, RWBY, Naruto"
25-02-2021T23:40:08,AkelaStormclaw,Beastars
25-02-2021T23:40:08,SageSaga,yeah but im ahead on the Light Novel from where the anime is - though it seems to be catching up
25-02-2021T23:40:13,ZRO4825,I need to try and power through the rest of season 1 of Re:Zero.
25-02-2021T23:40:28,Mediawatcher,I think beastars is likely the only manga I‚Äôve read full through
25-02-2021T23:40:40,SageSaga,honestly the anime is better than the LN though for Re Zero
25-02-2021T23:40:47,SageSaga,imo
25-02-2021T23:40:47,Mediawatcher,How come?
25-02-2021T23:40:48,AkelaStormclaw,"Cuz it's good, media"
25-02-2021T23:41:23,SageSaga,its not all that well written- it gets bogged down and goes to a crawl half the time
25-02-2021T23:41:40,Mediawatcher,Do webtoons count?
25-02-2021T23:41:42,ZRO4825,"I still haven‚Äôt watched or read any of Beastars, lol."
25-02-2021T23:41:48,SageSaga,also that speech the witch of greed gave-
25-02-2021T23:41:56,AkelaStormclaw,Bravely Default
25-02-2021T23:41:56,Mediawatcher,I‚Äôve read tons of those
25-02-2021T23:41:58,AkelaStormclaw,Nice
25-02-2021T23:42:00,SageSaga,was 6 pages long with no pauses in the LN
25-02-2021T23:42:11,ZRO4825,"I did binge the hell out of BNA though, I loved that. Michiru is frickin adorable."
25-02-2021T23:42:25,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Michiru <3
25-02-2021T23:42:31,Mediawatcher,Yeesh sometimes compressing things in adaptations aren‚Äôt so bad
25-02-2021T23:42:39,AkelaStormclaw,"Never read BNA, unfortunately"
25-02-2021T23:42:41,Mediawatcher,Bna was solid
25-02-2021T23:42:45,Mediawatcher,It doesn‚Äôt have a manga
25-02-2021T23:42:52,Mediawatcher,But had many problems
25-02-2021T23:42:53,Dadrobit,BNA was a 6.5/10 for me.
25-02-2021T23:43:01,Mediawatcher,Especially at the end
25-02-2021T23:43:02,AspiringNoodle,So stuffed ._.
25-02-2021T23:43:09,AspiringNoodle,"Haven't watched BNA yet, but Michiru looks cute"
25-02-2021T23:43:12,Ordithus,bna was fun
25-02-2021T23:43:14,BluePhantom90,I would give it a 7.5/10
25-02-2021T23:43:20,Mediawatcher,"I already went over it before, I‚Äôd give it a 7"
25-02-2021T23:43:30,ZRO4825,"Was gonna ask if it had a manga, lol. Seriously though, it‚Äôs a 8/10 watch. And yes, the sudden rush of the end is what drops it from a 10 imo."
25-02-2021T23:43:40,Mediawatcher,That twist was so out of nowhere
25-02-2021T23:43:48,Dadrobit,Its carried by the fantastic visuals and music. But the story was lacking imo.
25-02-2021T23:43:50,SageSaga,wat?
25-02-2021T23:44:01,BluePhantom90,BNA
25-02-2021T23:44:06,steelabjur,"Never seen, it's on my ""to watch"" list though."
25-02-2021T23:44:11,Mediawatcher,I won‚Äôt spoil it
25-02-2021T23:44:14,SageSaga,the twist seemed pretty normal to me
25-02-2021T23:44:14,Ordithus,that twist was set up the whole show
25-02-2021T23:44:15,ZRO4825,The twist wasn‚Äôt unexpected at all imo. But the sudden rush of pacing in the last couple eps was kinda oof.
25-02-2021T23:44:16,SageSaga,nothing special
25-02-2021T23:44:23,Twokinds,oh?
25-02-2021T23:44:41,Mediawatcher,It just went too fast
25-02-2021T23:44:45,Mediawatcher,The story I mean
25-02-2021T23:44:56,SageSaga,thats anime pacing
25-02-2021T23:45:10,Mediawatcher,Should‚Äôve been double the length
25-02-2021T23:45:15,SageSaga,no
25-02-2021T23:45:16,ZRO4825,"More like Trigger pacing tbh, lol"
25-02-2021T23:45:19,SageSaga,should have cut the filler
25-02-2021T23:45:21,BluePhantom90,the same creators should have done the same pacing as Kill La Kill
25-02-2021T23:45:35,Mediawatcher,Kill la kill is easily their best work
25-02-2021T23:45:38,SageSaga,it had way too much filler- if they cut it down it would have been fine
25-02-2021T23:45:48,SageSaga,doubling the length is usually a bad idea
25-02-2021T23:45:51,Ordithus,but bear baseball!
25-02-2021T23:45:56,BluePhantom90,its good
25-02-2021T23:45:58,Mediawatcher,Baseball was my favorite
25-02-2021T23:46:00,Twokinds,I wonder why that happens so often
25-02-2021T23:46:06,SageSaga,budgets
25-02-2021T23:46:12,Dadrobit,Tru
25-02-2021T23:46:13,ZRO4825,"Kill La Kill had the same issue really. The end just kinda slammed into the tail end of the series, lol."
25-02-2021T23:46:19,SageSaga,they legit crunch important parts for big budgets-
25-02-2021T23:46:22,Mediawatcher,There‚Äôs been a lot of controversy over how the animators are treated on japan
25-02-2021T23:46:34,SageSaga,heck - some studios legit get people to just do parts as a labor of love- no money
25-02-2021T23:46:37,Mediawatcher,Even demon slayer had their animators complaining
25-02-2021T23:46:41,BluePhantom90,I think Gurren Lagann was my favorite.
25-02-2021T23:47:03,Mediawatcher,"And that was the biggest hit of 2019 and 2020, especially for the manga"
25-02-2021T23:47:06,ZRO4825,"Gurren Lagann gave us Yoko, and for this the anime community will always give thanks."
25-02-2021T23:47:28,SageSaga,i think it was One Punch Man where they just asked a famous sakuka artist to do a scene without pay
25-02-2021T23:47:37,ZRO4825,....
25-02-2021T23:47:37,Mediawatcher,That is horrid
25-02-2021T23:47:41,Mediawatcher,Pay the animators!
25-02-2021T23:47:45,BluePhantom90,"Btw ""Log Horizon"" season 3 is slowly coming out"
25-02-2021T23:47:53,SageSaga,and he did it because he wanted to support his friends in that studio

25-02-2021T23:48:54,SageSaga,depends on how slow you want
25-02-2021T23:48:58,Mediawatcher,Not that one
25-02-2021T23:49:06,ZRO4825,Over 900 episodes and not at the end yet!
25-02-2021T23:49:10,SageSaga,.Hack is a great show- if it were 6 episodes?
25-02-2021T23:49:17,Mediawatcher,Not saying it‚Äôs bad but there is no way I‚Äôm watching all of that!
25-02-2021T23:49:21,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,I am caught up on One Piece
25-02-2021T23:49:49,Mediawatcher,I‚Äôm kind of aware of what‚Äôs going on
