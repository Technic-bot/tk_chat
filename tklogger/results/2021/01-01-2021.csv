01-01-2021T16:10:03,PhuufyDoodle,Heya Sage :)
01-01-2021T16:10:16,PhuufyDoodle,"Ohh, this page is coming out really nice, I love the colors!"
01-01-2021T16:10:36,SageSaga,thanks Phuufy! Hope you had a good birthday yesterday!
01-01-2021T16:10:51,PhuufyDoodle,"It was pretty good,thanks! I hope your New Years was good as well? :)"
01-01-2021T16:11:00,BadFoMo,Happy Belated Birthday!
01-01-2021T16:11:21,SageSaga,it went pretty good- nothing special though :P
01-01-2021T16:11:31,BadFoMo,Same.
01-01-2021T16:12:59,PhuufyDoodle,Im still in awe at your ability to continously make comic pages
01-01-2021T16:13:27,NinoGD,☕️
01-01-2021T16:13:45,PhuufyDoodle,Do you have all the scripts written in advance or do them as you make the pages?
01-01-2021T16:14:11,SageSaga,i just keep to my work schedule and just keep working till its done- at the cost of everything else O_O - For AI i do have all the scripts prewritten a chapter ahead
01-01-2021T16:14:35,SageSaga,yosh i kinda go with the flow so if i need some extra time i can do a less intense page usually
01-01-2021T16:15:13,SageSaga,its why i take holiday fillers for Yosh pretty seriously but AI gets no holiday breaks
01-01-2021T16:15:15,PhuufyDoodle,And you do it entirely on your own too?
01-01-2021T16:15:37,PhuufyDoodle,How much time do you spend writting vs drawing/coloring ?
01-01-2021T16:15:47,SageSaga,Mihari checks my spelling and grammar usually- but other than that yep- solo
01-01-2021T16:16:19,SageSaga,"well i spend a lot of ""free time"" thinking about the story- day dreaming it up- how the characters would act to the things working against them-"
01-01-2021T16:16:48,SageSaga,then when i get to writing it - it's mostly like just copying my thoughts to text  which is easy-
01-01-2021T16:17:03,SageSaga,wrote out this entire chapter in about an hour- 26 scripts
01-01-2021T16:17:12,PhuufyDoodle,Wow
01-01-2021T16:17:24,SageSaga,usually takes a bit longer but i had a very solid idea for this one
01-01-2021T16:17:30,SageSaga,had to cut some stuff though for time
01-01-2021T16:17:32,PhuufyDoodle,"Well that's really impressive, I wish I was able to do that much that quickly"
01-01-2021T16:18:00,PhuufyDoodle,"We actually hired on an editor back at the end of 2019, he's been helping with writing and quality control here and there"
01-01-2021T16:18:08,SageSaga,as for the art- well a sketch for a comic page can take me anywhere from 1-2 and a half hours- usually 1 hour to ink or less if im lucky-
01-01-2021T16:18:25,SageSaga,being able to hire someone for help is great
01-01-2021T16:18:30,PhuufyDoodle,"Yeah, I imagine you've gotten really efficient at that."
01-01-2021T16:18:53,SageSaga,once i draw a set of characters enough it becomes second nature to me
01-01-2021T16:19:31,SageSaga,if you look at the start of AI you will see a lot of oddities in the design- but it settles in and gets better in a couple chapters from there
01-01-2021T16:19:59,SageSaga,i still cant draw buildings well though T_T trying to learn how to paint towns and buildings better
01-01-2021T16:20:33,SageSaga,wish i could hire a BG artist XD
01-01-2021T16:20:55,PhuufyDoodle,Backgrounds can be hard for sure
01-01-2021T16:22:07,PhuufyDoodle,Well hopefully you will get the funds for that sometime in the near future!
01-01-2021T16:22:12,PhuufyDoodle,Just commission a couple pieces
01-01-2021T16:22:12,SageSaga,i do enjoy painting them sometimes- but its so much work and im not good at architecture
01-01-2021T16:22:46,SageSaga,im not sure how to even find artists these days for stuff like this XD
01-01-2021T16:22:55,SageSaga,im so bad at communicating with people
01-01-2021T16:23:39,PhuufyDoodle,"Yeah, I know that feeling. I have to really force myself to be sociable sometimes."
01-01-2021T16:24:30,SageSaga,people i already know pretty well i can talk to and enquirer about but new people? Scary XD
01-01-2021T16:24:54,SageSaga,also just keeping up with everyone is a task - i had to mute some old friends on Twitter too T_T
01-01-2021T16:25:15,BadFoMo,Dang.
01-01-2021T16:26:47,PhuufyDoodle,Yeeeeeeeah
01-01-2021T16:26:58,PhuufyDoodle,"People grow apart, sometimes their interests and morality does too.."
01-01-2021T16:28:12,BadFoMo,Sounds a little like what my 'friend' did/is doing where he doesn't really want to play L4D2 with others until he updates the campaign he is working on. ...A campaign he last updated in 2015.
01-01-2021T16:29:01,SageSaga,doesnt help that most artist are pretty solitary people- its like a bunch of people that want to be friends but asking them to reach out to each other is like two dentists trying to pull eachothers teeth out-
01-01-2021T16:29:56,PhuufyDoodle,"I've noticed that too, some artists may even see others are competition and oof"
01-01-2021T16:30:21,SageSaga,im still in shock that i often was like- a social butterfly at the conventions with the other artists- me- the guy who sometimes went an entire week at school without uttering a single word to another person
01-01-2021T16:30:24,PhuufyDoodle,"Writers are hard to find too, they seem to be an elusive bunch"
01-01-2021T16:30:31,PhuufyDoodle,Took ages and ages to find an editor
01-01-2021T16:31:18,PhuufyDoodle,Perhaps because you are around people you can talk about your interests with
01-01-2021T16:31:23,PhuufyDoodle,Also you have to pay to be there
01-01-2021T16:31:26,PhuufyDoodle,school is kind of forced
01-01-2021T16:33:13,SageSaga,it was so weird sitting at a table with like 3-5 other artist who just wouldnt talk even though we were all friends-
01-01-2021T16:33:39,SageSaga,and somehow i ended up the one getting them to talk- even to their fans sometimes XD
01-01-2021T16:34:06,SageSaga,"had some girls squeeling over Tom - and i was like ""you can just talk to him ya know-"""
01-01-2021T16:34:43,SageSaga,and they would look at me like im crazy- or ugly- maybe both :|
01-01-2021T16:39:45,SageSaga,but yeah i rarely talk to a lot of the other artist unless i have time to jump in their stream- and even then- i usually dont say anything
01-01-2021T16:43:32,CrRAR,"yeah I feel like when it comes to art it's like language, so despite being an expression, like novelists, small talk doesn't quite do anything justice"
01-01-2021T16:43:38,CrRAR,ideas can be big
01-01-2021T16:43:58,CrRAR,but all are quite beautiful
01-01-2021T16:44:33,SageSaga,it's just frustrating that i have all these ideas i wanna make into books and comics - but i just dont have the time
01-01-2021T16:44:45,SageSaga,and the only way to get more time is to take it from others
01-01-2021T16:44:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"God, girls fangirling over Tom is now a thing I need to see"
01-01-2021T16:45:05,CrRAR,gaggles of the spazz!
01-01-2021T16:45:09,CrRAR,GAGGLES!
01-01-2021T16:45:21,CrRAR,-according to Sage haha
01-01-2021T16:45:31,SageSaga,it happens a lot
01-01-2021T16:46:20,SageSaga,"i remember my friend turned to me at a Con and said ""Ive never seen a group of girls literally ""squee"" from seeing someone"""
01-01-2021T16:46:38,SageSaga,talking about girls who spotted Tom and his Twokinds banner
01-01-2021T16:49:27,Hogan,Eveninges!

01-01-2021T16:50:00,Hogan,YoYo Sage!
01-01-2021T16:51:31,SpazztasticKiwi,man you should see the strokes I’ve seen occur when people see Mark
01-01-2021T16:51:47,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s like Elvis has reappeared
01-01-2021T16:53:10,Hogan,"One day we'll need to gather all you fancy artists at a Con on my continent so I can see this ""Squeel""-effect in action! :D"
01-01-2021T16:54:08,CrRAR,Nyna achievement get: Moon the Moon
01-01-2021T16:54:10,SageSaga,ive never had a squee directed at me before
01-01-2021T16:54:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"first convention I manage to go to, I’m standing to the side & watching for a bit"
01-01-2021T16:55:06,SageSaga,oh geez- speaking of weird fans- a long time ago i found someone made a fanfiction of meeting Tom at a convention- and becoming his wife
01-01-2021T16:55:45,Hogan,The Conventions here dont attract that many artists from foreign parts... at least not from the webcomic environment since many still dont know anything about it despite me trying to nail it into them... with a mallet
01-01-2021T16:56:18,CrRAR,people living out their escapism somehow I guess
01-01-2021T16:56:47,Hogan,If given the chance I'll arrange for some squeeling Sage... :D
01-01-2021T16:57:42,Hogan,... but first we'll have to start Cons up again...
01-01-2021T17:00:59,SpazztasticKiwi,sage believe it or not that’s positively tepid to me
01-01-2021T17:01:45,CrRAR,haha
01-01-2021T17:02:10,Hogan,*sigh* I remember the times when artists from the comicgenesis-part met up annually for private cookouts in the States...
01-01-2021T17:02:47,Hogan,At its height it was up to 50 mainly artists who joined up for such an occasion
01-01-2021T17:03:07,SageSaga,yeah and they had a big Con presence
01-01-2021T17:03:29,Hogan,Also the Comicgenesis part or was that mostly Keenspot?
01-01-2021T17:04:26,Hogan,"I got to take part in some of the cookouts, but con-goings were a bit off for me... I could easier justify meeting 30-50 friends at private circumstances :-)"
01-01-2021T17:05:14,SageSaga,i get em mixed up because when i joined Comicgen it was called Keenspace
01-01-2021T17:05:29,SageSaga,and Keenspot was at a lot of cons
01-01-2021T17:06:07,Hogan,"Oh yes, thats right, they changed sometimes just after I had joined the community"
01-01-2021T17:07:09,Hogan,Keenspot was the High Tier of keenspace/comicgenesis
01-01-2021T17:07:34,SpazztasticKiwi,wat
01-01-2021T17:07:58,CrRAR,"wat, wat?"
01-01-2021T17:08:04,Hogan,wazza?
01-01-2021T17:08:30,SageSaga,im not sure if that is true actually- i thought that back in the  day- but i never checked it out-
01-01-2021T17:08:56,SageSaga,but i feel like they changed Keenspace to Comicgen was because Keenspot felt they didnt like being associated with them?
01-01-2021T17:09:04,SageSaga,or a full on trademark issue-
01-01-2021T17:09:16,SageSaga,which if they were connected- wouldnt have been an issue
01-01-2021T17:09:32,Hogan,"Well, I know of at least a few artists who joined up on keenspace and then was so successful that they were asked to join keenspot"
01-01-2021T17:09:54,Hogan,I think I remember the name-associating being a thing leading to the change to comicgenesis...
01-01-2021T17:10:46,Hogan,They would like to market Keenspot at the high tier comic environment and wanted to distance it from keenspace where anyone and their dog could join up...
01-01-2021T17:10:57,Hogan,"... or thats how I remember it, its been a while..."
01-01-2021T17:11:14,SpazztasticKiwi,alrighty I gotta go back in from lunch sooo
01-01-2021T17:11:49,BadFoMo,Bye?

01-01-2021T19:14:25,Mediawatcher,"And rip roan, died the same way he tried to kill maeve"
01-01-2021T19:16:04,Dadrobit,It's been a literal decade since the last real character death my dude.
01-01-2021T19:16:42,Ordithus,Tom is very sparing with death
01-01-2021T19:17:02,Mediawatcher,Yeah it is kind of rare to see anyone die
01-01-2021T19:17:12,Ordithus,"Carver would have been another good opportunity, but the comedic resolution was good"
01-01-2021T19:17:16,Mediawatcher,Unless it’s like a random soldier or a background character
01-01-2021T19:17:36,Mediawatcher,Ironically considering who the main character is
01-01-2021T19:17:51,Dadrobit,"Problem was/is (in my opinion at least) that there's a pretty bad balance between the amount of violence in TK, versus the actual threat level."
01-01-2021T19:17:53,Ordithus,"The cast isn't out of the woods, either"
01-01-2021T19:18:34,Mediawatcher,"I feel like someone isn’t he cast is gonna die this chapter, question is who?"

01-01-2021T19:19:06,Mediawatcher,"I feel like that’s gonna happen, can’t say for sure."
01-01-2021T19:19:19,Dadrobit,"Like, there's TONS of fighting that's happened since the Basitin isles, but in every case, nobody has bitten the dust."
01-01-2021T19:19:35,Mediawatcher,You mean besides the numerous soldiers?
01-01-2021T19:19:49,Mediawatcher,I’m sure someone died during that raid
01-01-2021T19:19:52,Dadrobit,Show me the bodies
01-01-2021T19:20:08,Ordithus,"not on page, so doesn't carry weight"
01-01-2021T19:20:35,Mediawatcher,"We’ll most likely get a similar situation to the basitin islands, but I’m curious as to who will bite the dust besides roan"
01-01-2021T19:20:38,Dadrobit,Like I was saying last night (when I was still assuming Roan was fine-ish) TwoKinds tends to run with A-Team logic.
01-01-2021T19:20:52,Dadrobit,"Lots of violence, but never show any death"
01-01-2021T19:20:53,Mediawatcher,Probably be the same situation here
01-01-2021T19:21:08,Mediawatcher,I mean we got a fakeout with karen
01-01-2021T19:21:21,Mediawatcher,And sythe
01-01-2021T19:21:24,Dadrobit,"And Carver, and Nibbly"
01-01-2021T19:21:32,Dadrobit,And Zen
01-01-2021T19:21:50,Mediawatcher,I get the feeling there is gonna be more fake outs this chapter with the main cast at least
01-01-2021T19:21:51,Dadrobit,Arguably Maddie
01-01-2021T19:21:58,Ordithus,We'll see what he does with the current predicaments
01-01-2021T19:22:07,Mediawatcher,I think the beach goers are good
01-01-2021T19:22:08,Ordithus,"Sythe, Zen, and Maren are all in very grave danger"
01-01-2021T19:22:21,Mediawatcher,Those three are not in a good spot right now
01-01-2021T19:22:21,Dadrobit,Lynn is.... Somewhere
01-01-2021T19:22:30,Mediawatcher,Trace will save maren it’s building up to that
01-01-2021T19:22:45,Mediawatcher,As for sythe and zen remit might intervene

01-01-2021T19:23:17,Ordithus,Rose will almost certainly (finally) die

01-01-2021T19:23:41,Mediawatcher,I get the feeling there’s gonna be another fake out where sythe is about to die and reni or someone else willl intervene
01-01-2021T19:23:49,Mediawatcher,Rose will most likely bite the dust
01-01-2021T19:23:55,Dadrobit,(And we can finally find out if he was Maddie's dad)

01-01-2021T20:57:03,Roughlandin,Well I can think of several not-stream-appropriate ways that topic could go. I'll just use my imagination to fill in the rest
01-01-2021T20:57:19,CrRAR,Spazz do you ever get updates on that parking lot kitten you saved?

01-01-2021T21:06:26,Roughlandin,It'll be so much better than going to see one of those fake mall Toms

01-01-2021T21:06:43,CrRAR,“Just follow the high-pitched squeals apparently“

01-01-2021T21:09:48,CrRAR,"lol, depending on your table conduct he either signs you a sketch..."
01-01-2021T21:09:57,CrRAR,oooor a restraining order
01-01-2021T21:10:00,CrRAR,XD

01-01-2021T21:11:50,Roughlandin,Mark can handle himself. His mom taught him all her self defense secrets
01-01-2021T21:12:16,CrRAR,Was everyone just like “it’s THAT guy!?”
01-01-2021T21:12:33,Roughlandin,And Tom knows all he has to do is give me saucy Mike sketches and I'm docile as a cub
01-01-2021T21:13:07,CrRAR,"Ha, there is that double sided mike print"
01-01-2021T21:13:07,SpazztasticKiwi,it was more like *verbal excited hormones*

01-01-2021T21:15:55,CrRAR,One male side female side on the other yeah
01-01-2021T21:17:15,Ordithus,"Flora, Kathrin, and Natani are the others, since Raine was already mentioned <3"
01-01-2021T21:17:56,Roughlandin,I would have SO much explaining to do to my family if any of them found something like that in my room lol
01-01-2021T21:18:11,Roughlandin,"""You don't understand, Mom. These are my friends!"""

01-01-2021T21:27:55,Roughlandin,I'd just climb a tree
01-01-2021T21:28:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m tempted to hit some of y’all with a Bible sometimes
01-01-2021T21:28:27,Roughlandin,My school tried that for 12 years. Now I'm a furry.
01-01-2021T21:29:41,Roughlandin,But I did get a bitchin' AP Comparative Abrahamic Religions course out of it
01-01-2021T21:29:48,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-VivianPanic: furry?!
01-01-2021T21:30:17,Roughlandin,Pay no attention to the man behind the bear suit!

01-01-2021T21:37:51,BlackjackSec99,I was 9
01-01-2021T21:38:56,Roughlandin,Lol I get that. Honestly I went to a pretty liberal catholic school. Though it WAS still a catholic school
01-01-2021T21:39:30,BlackjackSec99,"ooo, yeah, my dad did too, but his was... not liberal....."
01-01-2021T21:39:52,BlackjackSec99,"like, got his knuckles rapped with a ruler, literally"
01-01-2021T21:40:24,BlackjackSec99,"there was a reason he left the church, and he refused to talk about it with anyone."
01-01-2021T21:41:01,Roughlandin,Ha. I was past the ruler days. I only ever had two nuns for teachers and they both wore everyday clothes
01-01-2021T21:42:31,Roughlandin,Worst punishment I ever got was getting forced to go dig in a garden. And that was by my 8th grade science teacher

01-01-2021T21:46:55,BlackjackSec99,hehehehehe
01-01-2021T21:46:56,Roughlandin,Love that book/movie

01-01-2021T21:47:55,Roughlandin,But IRL he's a pretty big jerk yeah
01-01-2021T21:48:13,Roughlandin,I kinda sympathize with him though. Apparently his childhood was a nightmare
01-01-2021T21:48:13,BlackjackSec99,"ehhhh, if you know him like I do it changes your outlook on his 'acting'"
01-01-2021T21:48:26,BlackjackSec99,"no it wasent, not like he makes it out to be"
01-01-2021T21:48:38,BlackjackSec99,he grew up in my neighborhood
01-01-2021T21:48:44,Roughlandin,Oh huh
01-01-2021T21:49:18,BlackjackSec99,ALWAYS used to brag about how he was a TV star first thing apon meeting people and acted like he was hot shit
01-01-2021T21:49:38,BlackjackSec99,"like, thats all he would talk about"
01-01-2021T21:49:39,Roughlandin,I've heard his parents were pretty douchy
01-01-2021T21:49:47,BlackjackSec99,and he looked down on everything else.
01-01-2021T21:49:57,BlackjackSec99,everyone else*
01-01-2021T21:50:18,Roughlandin,Guess he was building that hollywood star attitude early
01-01-2021T21:50:24,BlackjackSec99,"yeah, I could see that, cause usually traits like that are learned from parents"
01-01-2021T21:51:10,Roughlandin,Only story I know of his personal life is that time Kanye stole all his clothes
01-01-2021T21:51:21,BlackjackSec99,"yeah, like pre-teen early. I was around him for 5 minutes at our local pool before I had to leave. I couldnt take the ego trip any longer"

01-01-2021T21:52:48,BlackjackSec99,"I mean, MAYBE hes changed now, but who knows. Ide give him the chance, because Im into giving people chances and all, and most people do embarrasing things in their teens, but, meh, wouldnt hold my breath"
01-01-2021T21:53:01,CrRAR,Eh it could have just been that he made his identity a shallow hollywood-type persona cuz of the lack of identity before that?
01-01-2021T21:53:17,CrRAR,Didn’t know who to be other than douchey
01-01-2021T21:53:22,Roughlandin,Teens are awful universally. I know I was
01-01-2021T21:53:33,CrRAR,He did kinda have a break-down like 5 years ago
01-01-2021T21:53:36,BlackjackSec99,"could be. Young kid, trying to find a place in the world and thats how adults around him act"
01-01-2021T21:54:11,CrRAR,"That newer movied he did he played a jerk dad I think, mostly cuz the story was familiar/personal to him he had a crap upbringing"
01-01-2021T21:54:27,CrRAR,Maybe he finally had to come to terms with it
01-01-2021T21:54:40,CrRAR,...like finally caught up to him.
01-01-2021T21:55:07,SpazztasticKiwi,some kids need a helping hand to straighten them out
01-01-2021T21:55:08,BlackjackSec99,"yeah, like I said Ide give him a chance, if he even remembered me (doubt) cause people CAN change."
01-01-2021T21:55:12,SpazztasticKiwi,across the face
01-01-2021T21:55:14,CrRAR,“Honey Boy” was the movie
01-01-2021T21:55:33,CrRAR,He plays like a degernate trailer-trashy jerk guy
01-01-2021T21:55:40,BlackjackSec99,"you know, I think I heard something about that, the personal to him part of it anyway"
01-01-2021T21:55:58,Roughlandin,"Yeah. Apparently he modeled the character off his dad, who was a huckster and weed dealer"
01-01-2021T21:56:06,CrRAR,yeah
01-01-2021T21:56:23,Roughlandin,Apparently his dad gave him pot for the first time when he was 10
01-01-2021T21:56:52,BlackjackSec99,"fitting, considering the area we live in seems to have several of those. Daddy X from Kottonmouth Kings used to live here too. Now THATS a cool famous dude."
01-01-2021T21:57:11,CrRAR,His claim to fame was being on “even stevens” so success to him was being a jerky teenager persona
01-01-2021T21:57:21,BlackjackSec99,^
01-01-2021T21:57:27,CrRAR,If a certain way of acting is rewarded it perpetuates

01-01-2021T21:58:28,BlackjackSec99,"like, you know how he acts in the first Transformers, for the first bit of it up till he finds out his car is bad ass? Thats really similar to how he acted in person."
01-01-2021T21:58:57,BlackjackSec99,"minus the scared of talking to girls part, that wasent a thing..."
01-01-2021T21:59:13,Roughlandin,Lol. Only famous person I know is that one guy from Tiger King
01-01-2021T21:59:32,BlackjackSec99,.......OK gonna need more info on that lol
01-01-2021T21:59:43,Roughlandin,Not Joe Exotic
01-01-2021T22:00:39,Roughlandin,Tim Stark. The guy who runs WIldlife in Need. He was building Joe's second park until he realized they weren't going to pay him
01-01-2021T22:00:59,BlackjackSec99,"also, not true, we all know a famous person! Hes got a killer web comic!"
01-01-2021T22:01:19,BlackjackSec99,"ohhhh that dude, at least he got out before drama happened lol"

01-01-2021T22:10:44,CrRAR,Nick IS a Coppola his “hollywood” name became Nick Cage cuz he specifically wanted to avoid rumors of nepotism
01-01-2021T22:11:03,CrRAR,Adam’s dad is a Copolla sibling

01-01-2021T23:14:02,SpazztasticKiwi,could Brutus pull off a minion costume
01-01-2021T23:14:28,CrRAR,He’d look like a Fall Guy:tm:
01-01-2021T23:14:46,SpazztasticKiwi,cat....on leg....putting leg....to sleep
01-01-2021T23:15:05,CrRAR,...which wouldn’t be a terrible costume... considering his arrangement with Clovis
01-01-2021T23:15:34,SpazztasticKiwi,supposed to be a serious costume
01-01-2021T23:15:40,SpazztasticKiwi,ends up looking cute
01-01-2021T23:15:44,CrRAR,Bagheera strangles your leg with love
01-01-2021T23:16:09,SpazztasticKiwi,“I cuddles”
01-01-2021T23:16:46,Roughlandin,Brutus could pull off ANY costume.
01-01-2021T23:16:50,CrRAR,“Leg asleep means no escape”
01-01-2021T23:16:57,Roughlandin,...Hmm. Brutus in a Nibbly onesie?
01-01-2021T23:17:08,Roughlandin,Putting it on my sketch list!!
01-01-2021T23:17:22,CrRAR,A bigger tail on Brutus would obviously be a win
01-01-2021T23:17:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"cats are such a tipping point for me, I see a video with one & a guy shows up about my age, I want to learn if he’s single"

01-01-2021T23:18:19,SpazztasticKiwi,little furry footies
01-01-2021T23:18:19,Roughlandin,...I just learned that Stormie and Rosie met for the first time tonight
01-01-2021T23:18:36,CrRAR,Bengal was Rosie right?
01-01-2021T23:18:45,Roughlandin,Yep. Stormie is our Maine Coon
01-01-2021T23:18:54,Roughlandin,The Bengal is my sister's
01-01-2021T23:19:27,CrRAR,I feel like they would have very polar personalitis
01-01-2021T23:19:29,Roughlandin,Stormie usually hides in the basement when they come over. The basement door was open and curious little Rosie went down to check it out
01-01-2021T23:19:36,CrRAR,Yeah!
01-01-2021T23:19:40,Roughlandin,Yep
01-01-2021T23:19:47,CrRAR,Bengals are VERY curious
01-01-2021T23:20:16,Roughlandin,Stormie was trying to pretend to be a cat statue and Rosie was pretending to be a tigar
01-01-2021T23:20:18,Roughlandin,tiger
01-01-2021T23:21:23,Roughlandin,"Like I said, at least no bloodshed. They left a minute ago and Stormie is now in her usual spot on the couch"
01-01-2021T23:21:37,Roughlandin,She knows the moment they leave lol
01-01-2021T23:21:45,CrRAR,haha
01-01-2021T23:22:23,SpazztasticKiwi,that sound like Kiwi whenever I had my ex over
01-01-2021T23:22:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"nowhere to be found until he left, then she materialized out of nowhere"
01-01-2021T23:23:14,Roughlandin,She's a mess. She's super mad at us anyway because we opening doors to cold and wet instead of the warm sunny outside she wants
01-01-2021T23:23:23,Ordithus,:cat2:
01-01-2021T23:23:57,Roughlandin,"I keeping telling her that's the only outside there is right now, but she won't listen lol"
01-01-2021T23:24:43,CrRAR,"“Who bought this house, this is not the right house for me”"
01-01-2021T23:26:28,CrRAR,she can just keep checking till it’s better
01-01-2021T23:30:27,SpazztasticKiwi,cats don’t have object permanence
01-01-2021T23:31:15,CrRAR,"too many things, so little sttention span"
01-01-2021T23:31:17,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s why if you have 2 doors that go to the kitchen they’ll only use the one they first used
01-01-2021T23:31:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"they don’t get that there can be or that other door is, another entrance/exit"
01-01-2021T23:31:50,CrRAR,Safe door is good door
01-01-2021T23:32:17,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s also why they tend to only use one spot as an entrance & another as an exit
01-01-2021T23:32:26,SpazztasticKiwi,cats are furry toddlers
01-01-2021T23:32:29,CrRAR,I feel like is that more because they’re creatures of habit?
01-01-2021T23:33:27,Roughlandin,Stormie does that. Outside through the back door. Inside through the front door
01-01-2021T23:33:48,Roughlandin,Sometimes she just goes out back and literally sprints around to the front to scream to be let in
01-01-2021T23:33:56,CrRAR,lol
01-01-2021T23:34:21,SpazztasticKiwi,“human! the portal has closed!”
01-01-2021T23:34:36,CrRAR,There would be no way to teach them that doors could be used both ways?
01-01-2021T23:35:27,CrRAR,animals learn certain things like where there are glass doors the get cautious eventaully from running into them
01-01-2021T23:35:36,CrRAR,*they
01-01-2021T23:37:48,CrRAR,Sometimes is it more them thinking it’s how the human behaves and adapting to that?
01-01-2021T23:37:54,CrRAR,"Cat: “Human let me in at front door once, that mist be where human lets me in”"
01-01-2021T23:38:06,CrRAR,*must
01-01-2021T23:39:03,Ordithus,my cats growing up must have been the smart ones
01-01-2021T23:39:24,CrRAR,hehehe
01-01-2021T23:39:28,Ordithus,"if a door wasn't latched it didn't stop them, push or pull"
01-01-2021T23:40:35,CrRAR,Yeah I feel like a cat’s first job at a house is like mapping everything out
01-01-2021T23:40:48,CrRAR,“This is my kingdom”
01-01-2021T23:40:59,CrRAR,*sits up high and observes ALL*
01-01-2021T23:43:13,SpazztasticKiwi,you could probably try taking them through all the doors through both ways so they can see
01-01-2021T23:43:47,CrRAR,That’s an amusing visual
01-01-2021T23:44:10,Ordithus,pretty amusing if they wanted in a room they'd stick their paws under the door and open it
