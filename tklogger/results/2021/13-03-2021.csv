13-03-2021T15:23:49,Dadrobit,I love it
13-03-2021T15:23:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I prefer Death Stranding of Detroit tbh.  But Connor is best boy

13-03-2021T15:24:14,ProsePro7,Glad to hear it.  All I have been hearing is that it was an Amazon Prime simulator

13-03-2021T15:45:28,SpazztasticKiwi,because I remembered a scene from inuyasha like that

13-03-2021T15:45:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I figured so
13-03-2021T15:45:58,Ordithus,the joke writes itself
13-03-2021T15:46:20,Roughlandin,I think somebody got told to sit like Kagome told Inuyasha to about once an episode
13-03-2021T15:46:53,SpazztasticKiwi,sango tried it on him once
13-03-2021T15:47:17,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Nat fetch is cute
13-03-2021T15:47:26,SpazztasticKiwi,sort of an experiment to see if it worked and it didn‚Äôt but inu still didn‚Äôt find it amusing
13-03-2021T15:47:38,Roughlandin,I remember getting the manga as a kid and being surprised how much more uh... graphic it was
13-03-2021T15:48:11,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,:ctwokinds-MikeLewd:
13-03-2021T15:49:00,Roughlandin,Yep. Everybody sure had a lot less clothes
13-03-2021T15:49:19,ProsePro7,Rimiko Takahashi.  She wrote Inuyasha.  She also wrote Ranma 1/2 and that is even more lewd
13-03-2021T15:50:20,Roughlandin,And Inuyasha was a shonen series. They sure could get away with a lot in the 90s lol
13-03-2021T15:50:35,SpazztasticKiwi,the anime had some generous convenient censoring
13-03-2021T15:50:40,ProsePro7,Japan had less stringent standards when it comes to nudity
13-03-2021T15:50:55,ProsePro7,The 80s were even crazier
13-03-2021T15:51:18,Roughlandin,I say that while ignoring that Redo of Healer is currently a thing
13-03-2021T15:51:33,ProsePro7,Oh there is worse
13-03-2021T15:51:40,Roughlandin,Also Goblin Slayer
13-03-2021T15:51:46,ProsePro7,GS is awesome
13-03-2021T15:51:58,Roughlandin,It... sure is a thing
13-03-2021T15:52:05,ProsePro7,Seen Overlord?
13-03-2021T15:52:21,Roughlandin,Like the first season
13-03-2021T15:52:27,ProsePro7,It gets darker
13-03-2021T15:52:33,Roughlandin,So I've heard lol
13-03-2021T15:53:11,Roughlandin,What is it with super dark anime lately? I kinda got over it after trying to watch Japan Sinks
13-03-2021T15:53:50,ProsePro7,"Its been around for a while.  Bastard, Berserk, Hellsing.  People just notice every now and then"

13-03-2021T15:56:22,ProsePro7,Just put in the transporter and send it over
13-03-2021T15:56:32,Dadrobit,Isn't Baja Blast that Taco Bell drink?
13-03-2021T15:56:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Yes
13-03-2021T15:56:52,Roughlandin,It's the soda Mt Dew made specifically for Taco Bell. Nectar of the GOds

13-03-2021T16:45:49,ProsePro7,How people in this would look down on being ruled by a FRIKING DRAGON is beyond me
13-03-2021T16:46:06,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,just hand over your kingdom already people
13-03-2021T16:46:07,Roughlandin,"I, for one, welcome our new scaly overlords"
13-03-2021T16:46:07,CrimsonQuill086,Wouldn't it also provide some legal troubles given how dragons (even mixed-species dragons) are long-lived?
13-03-2021T16:46:12,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Reni should Rule!!!!
13-03-2021T16:46:24,BadFoMo,"Yeah, that sounds like something that would happen."

13-03-2021T16:47:29,Twokinds,There is one island in the world with a dragon ruling over and collecting taxes from the humans. But it's specific to that island.
13-03-2021T16:47:44,Roughlandin,...How does one apply for citizenship?
13-03-2021T16:47:44,BadFoMo,Oh?
13-03-2021T16:47:46,ProsePro7,Was that on the map?
13-03-2021T16:48:02,Roughlandin,The map is just of Mekkan
13-03-2021T16:48:04,Twokinds,"I don't remember if that was on the map, or if it was too small a location"

13-03-2021T16:48:32,Twokinds,"The humans actually did, after hundred of years, try to rebel against the ruling dragon to stop the tax collection."
13-03-2021T16:48:32,CrimsonQuill086,"Tom, just out of curiosity, do you ever end up making lore on-the-fly during streams in response to questions? 'Cause you have a lot of it fleshed out, but i'd say we might#ve blindsided you at least once"

13-03-2021T16:49:02,CrimsonQuill086,What were they being taxed on?
13-03-2021T16:49:06,ProsePro7,I think half of TK comes from these streams

13-03-2021T16:49:17,Twokinds,It was a tax for protection against other invading humans.

13-03-2021T16:49:25,Twokinds,"The dragon left and the island began to sink into the ocean, because the dragon made the island with magic, and without him, it couldn't stay up."
13-03-2021T16:49:37,Ordithus,ohsnap
13-03-2021T16:49:38,CrimsonQuill086,...I'd pay up tbh

13-03-2021T16:50:21,w0lfmare,That must have been awkward

13-03-2021T18:11:17,Roughlandin,Is it that hard to just cut a hole and put a piece of fabric in there? You've already done half the work!
13-03-2021T18:11:26,falangie123,i think the best cultural development in the last 10 years has been big butt = good

13-03-2021T18:12:07,Twokinds,"Although it would be funny if even with pocket dimension pockets, the ones in women's clothing was still smaller."
13-03-2021T18:12:15,ProsePro7,I still say Patreon puts this behind the wall

13-03-2021T18:12:57,Roughlandin,Bleck
13-03-2021T18:13:10,BaskervilleNQH,Pocket dimension of womens clothes are all to the same space. Whereas mens pockets get their own dimensional space per pocket.
13-03-2021T18:13:14,Ordithus,if it is allowed lol

13-03-2021T22:34:36,Twokinds,"I'm still paranoid their going to temp close the Patreon anyway, just to be spiteful even after Patron Only-ing so many things. lol"

13-03-2021T22:35:04,w0lfmare,Best of luck!
13-03-2021T22:35:06,KatV,"ahh,that's why kat's wearing clothes more than usual?"
13-03-2021T22:35:07,RimaDraws,i had trouble with them last year
13-03-2021T22:35:09,KatV,;p
13-03-2021T22:35:11,DarthKeidran,Thanks @OmniOtter. I plan on it.
13-03-2021T22:35:13,Ordithus,"you've got to be complying, and then some"
13-03-2021T22:35:14,unsteddyphoenix,"Even on the miracle, we'll all follow you to something else I think"
13-03-2021T22:35:18,steelabjur,"There are a few options to Patreon, if you need something else..."
13-03-2021T22:35:19,BadFoMo,Here's hoping they don't.
13-03-2021T22:35:20,Combak,They have gone after people who posted stuff that they wanted paywalled on other sites.
13-03-2021T22:35:20,Roughlandin,"Either way, I'll keep giving you money haha"
13-03-2021T22:35:24,FenceEqualizer,So weird seeing them do that. I'm sure you're making them a nice chunk of change think they'd not try to hurt that.
13-03-2021T22:35:51,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-daydreamingkat:
13-03-2021T22:35:55,AspiringNoodle,I wouldn't be so sure
13-03-2021T22:35:56,KatV,I really like that kat pic
13-03-2021T22:35:59,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,rude
13-03-2021T22:36:00,ZapiliDver,back.
13-03-2021T22:36:03,AspiringNoodle,Patreon has mastered the art of shooting themselves in the foot.
13-03-2021T22:36:04,CrRAR,wb
13-03-2021T22:36:05,KeefMcDerpface,bye all leaving.
13-03-2021T22:36:06,unsteddyphoenix,Gnight Kat <3
13-03-2021T22:36:09,FloofyBall,Isn't all of the Patreon content non-paywalled though?
13-03-2021T22:36:10,ZapiliDver,"and thanks for the stream, Tom"
13-03-2021T22:36:12,Roughlandin,I can't stop watching the trees now that Tom mentioned they move
13-03-2021T22:36:26,Twokinds,It's all hosted on my DA
13-03-2021T22:36:30,Twokinds,For anyone not a Patron.
13-03-2021T22:36:34,RimaDraws,ty for streaming tom
13-03-2021T22:36:35,DarthKeidran,"Also, I really am sick of patreon‚Äôs BS. I don‚Äôt know (really anything to be honest) about it, but I know some creators and YouTubers have moved to SubscribeStar."
13-03-2021T22:36:37,Ordithus,"good old reliable, weird da"
13-03-2021T22:36:44,CrRAR,haha
13-03-2021T22:36:54,Roughlandin,Thanks so much Tom. Sorry you had such a rotten week
13-03-2021T22:37:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"DA, when the weirdo has your back"
13-03-2021T22:37:06,KatV,does DA not remove suggestive pics?
13-03-2021T22:37:18,Twokinds,Honestly I like DA's image handling way better than all this constant-scrolling stuff every website is going for these days.
13-03-2021T22:37:29,FloofyBall,I like DA but I wish it had a better tagging system.
13-03-2021T22:37:35,Twokinds,"I just want a nice grid of images,. Easy viewing."
13-03-2021T22:37:40,CrRAR,yeah gallery view
13-03-2021T22:37:40,KatV,"Patreon's site is very laggy too, especially on my phone"
13-03-2021T22:37:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Big agree
13-03-2021T22:37:43,RimaDraws,yea
13-03-2021T22:37:44,FenceEqualizer,Same to be honest. scrolls start to slow my pc so much
13-03-2021T22:37:47,DarthKeidran,Have a better week Tom!
13-03-2021T22:37:47,CrRAR,a dying feature ;~;
13-03-2021T22:37:51,FloofyBall,"Say what you will about sites like e621, but the ""tag what you see"" policy makes it easy to find images."
13-03-2021T22:37:53,Roughlandin,Yeah patreon's a nightmare to navigate if you're looking for older pics
13-03-2021T22:37:53,RimaDraws,i like the gallery view
13-03-2021T22:37:55,RheagarsArtEmporium,What is Da?
13-03-2021T22:38:03,KatV,DeviantArt
13-03-2021T22:38:04,Roughlandin,Deviant Art
13-03-2021T22:38:05,BadFoMo,Devant Art.
13-03-2021T22:38:05,DarthKeidran,Who here hates DA‚Äôs Eclipse?
13-03-2021T22:38:13,KatV,I like it
13-03-2021T22:38:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Eclipse is fine, it works"
13-03-2021T22:38:32,Ordithus,might as well link it. all the mirrored sketches from patreon! https://www.deviantart.com/twokinds/gallery/77584748/patreon-mirror
13-03-2021T22:38:32,CrRAR,they just wanted to evolve I guess
13-03-2021T22:38:40,Roughlandin,Thanks for the link Ord!
13-03-2021T22:38:45,RheagarsArtEmporium,Well ill follow to whatever platform
13-03-2021T22:38:45,FloofyBall,Wanna find that one specific Sunday Sketch of Kathrin and Raine cooking and Kathrin freaking ot because Raine set it on fire? Gotta guess the name because DA's tagging is a bit bare.
13-03-2021T22:38:55,Twokinds,"I don't have a huge issue with it, though I do hate how they kneecapped the search function for the rest of dA by removing catagories."
13-03-2021T22:39:07,Twokinds,"Makes it impossible to find, for example, resources and textures."
13-03-2021T22:39:15,Twokinds,Which I used to do a lot.
13-03-2021T22:39:22,BadFoMo,@DarthKeidran I hate that they /removed/ some of the quallety of life parts.
13-03-2021T22:39:23,CrRAR,hmm
13-03-2021T22:39:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Floofy if you are looking for a particular piece use this https://twokinds.gallery/
13-03-2021T22:39:28,DarthKeidran,To me it broke my notifications. If I‚Äôve got a bunch of group notifications I can‚Äôt go and clear some without reloading the notifications page afterward. Also search failures as well.
13-03-2021T22:39:50,Roughlandin,TK Gallery is awesome for finding specific pieces
13-03-2021T22:39:54,DarthKeidran,@BadFoMo Same.
13-03-2021T22:39:57,BadFoMo,@Twokinds That's what I'm talking about.
13-03-2021T22:40:08,steelabjur,"Thanks for that link, @Ordithus!"
13-03-2021T22:40:16,Twokinds,tk gallery is super useful!
13-03-2021T22:40:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I love it
13-03-2021T22:40:27,KatV,tk gallery?
13-03-2021T22:40:30,Ordithus,it even has some of the recent omni polls
13-03-2021T22:40:37,Twokinds,It was actually invaluable for quickly finding all the stuff I needed to move off of Patreon
13-03-2021T22:40:40,FloofyBall,"It has a ""Canonical"" tag"
13-03-2021T22:40:42,Twokinds,Patreon itself is soooo slow
13-03-2021T22:40:48,Roughlandin,https://twokinds.gallery/
13-03-2021T22:40:48,CrRAR,yeah
13-03-2021T22:40:56,FloofyBall,Patreon on my phone is a nightmare to go through.
13-03-2021T22:40:58,KatV,is tk gallery a completely different platform
13-03-2021T22:40:59,KatV,?
13-03-2021T22:41:04,Roughlandin,Trying to scroll through patreon locks up my web browser
13-03-2021T22:41:08,Twokinds,And Patreon's constant scrolling just hangs the website after like 3 scrolls down
13-03-2021T22:41:11,DarthKeidran,"Yes. The TwoKinds Gallary is amazing. Especially considering it includes everything Tom has done, even stuff on Twitter."
13-03-2021T22:41:18,Twokinds,It's completely broken
13-03-2021T22:41:22,Twokinds,Why not just use pages like before
13-03-2021T22:41:24,MuonNeutrino,"i noticed patron was making you mark more stuff as patron-only, did they actually make you outright *remove* some things?"
13-03-2021T22:41:24,Twokinds,Makes no sense
13-03-2021T22:41:33,Twokinds,Nothing has been removed
13-03-2021T22:41:34,RheagarsArtEmporium,agreed
13-03-2021T22:41:41,BadFoMo,"The only thing they fixed for me was this bug where, when scrolling through large foders, the page would just 'auto-scroll'."
13-03-2021T22:41:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"@FloofyBall https://twokinds.gallery/ Check it out, it's pretty great"
13-03-2021T22:41:44,KatV,I'm pretty sure Patreon actually broke my phone's chrome browser
13-03-2021T22:41:46,RimaDraws,i kinda wanna move back to DA
13-03-2021T22:41:54,MuonNeutrino,and yeah the gallery site is amazing
13-03-2021T22:41:56,KatV,like it'll open and just hang on a blank gray screen
13-03-2021T22:42:04,MuonNeutrino,the fact that you can search on *combinations* of tags is super useful too
13-03-2021T22:42:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Ooofy
13-03-2021T22:42:10,KatV,I had to move over to firefox because of it
13-03-2021T22:42:18,MuonNeutrino,like finding sketches that have both keith and maddie in them or whatever
13-03-2021T22:42:24,DarthKeidran,That also @MuonNeutrino
13-03-2021T22:42:29,Roughlandin,You could try deleting chrome and redownloading it
13-03-2021T22:42:34,KeefMcDerpface,^
13-03-2021T22:42:37,KatV,I have
13-03-2021T22:42:40,Roughlandin,Oh wow
13-03-2021T22:42:40,KeefMcDerpface,uh oh
13-03-2021T22:42:41,KatV,it just keeps happening
13-03-2021T22:42:42,DarthKeidran,Rip
13-03-2021T22:43:03,KatV,idk if it's my phone (very well could be) or some update bug
13-03-2021T22:43:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,It's basically a list of all the TK pieces with link to the patreon and direct downloads
13-03-2021T22:43:18,Roughlandin,Might be leftover files in your phone's drive
13-03-2021T22:43:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,And you can filter by characters
13-03-2021T22:43:24,DarthKeidran,Screw me hitting the hay. I‚Äôm having too much fun ragging on big tech firms for not listening to their customers.
13-03-2021T22:43:30,steelabjur,I remember being able to comment on Patreon posts even though I'm not a patron. Now I seem to not be able to and haven't been for months...
13-03-2021T22:43:34,Roughlandin,Fight Da Powah!
13-03-2021T22:43:37,KeefMcDerpface,night Darth
13-03-2021T22:43:47,Roughlandin,"Do you have an account, Steel?"
13-03-2021T22:43:48,CrRAR,yeah android lets you clear cache and stored garbage
13-03-2021T22:44:04,FloofyBall,Have you ever thought about hosting your own repository of images as a main thing instead of DA and Patreon?
13-03-2021T22:44:16,KatV,"Yea, I've actually tried switching to an iphone, that only lasted about a week and a half lmao"
13-03-2021T22:44:17,Roughlandin,"Then he has to pay to host the site, though"
13-03-2021T22:44:20,Ordithus,I think one of the recent updates broke non-patrons being able to comment
13-03-2021T22:44:24,DarthKeidran,"Oh, not going to bed yet. Having too much fun ragging on Patreon and DA"
13-03-2021T22:44:27,CrRAR,yeap
13-03-2021T22:44:32,steelabjur,"Yeah, not under this name, but under my real name."
13-03-2021T22:44:41,CrRAR,I thought that was deliberate
13-03-2021T22:44:42,Roughlandin,Oh great. Remember when liking comments and post was broke for weeks?
13-03-2021T22:44:44,ProsePro7,DA is better just has bad reputation
13-03-2021T22:44:52,CrRAR,yeah rough
13-03-2021T22:44:55,CrRAR,haha
13-03-2021T22:44:58,steelabjur,@Roughlandin
13-03-2021T22:45:06,KatV,"I think my phone's ram is probably contributing to chrome being broken, I wish the battery on my old phone was still good"
13-03-2021T22:45:07,RheagarsArtEmporium,its all part of the the internet Cabal
13-03-2021T22:45:18,DarthKeidran,@Roughlandin I remember when hundreds of comments got wiped out on Patreon.
13-03-2021T22:45:33,DarthKeidran,"Weeks or months of old story comments, gone."
13-03-2021T22:45:35,RheagarsArtEmporium,pulling a youtube
13-03-2021T22:45:43,Roughlandin,I'm glad Patreon uses all the money they skim off Tom to pay for a functioning site that isn't broken half the time...
13-03-2021T22:45:56,KeefMcDerpface,"Also hey, congrats Rough for finding a leprechaun and stealing his gold to pay for your sub."
13-03-2021T22:46:16,Roughlandin,They'll never get me Beary Bites!
13-03-2021T22:46:19,steelabjur,"For like a month there, I could delete posts of other Patreon users on Tom's Patreon (and only Toms). It was wierd..."
13-03-2021T22:46:31,DarthKeidran,That‚Äôs odd.
13-03-2021T22:46:32,FloofyBall,"I thought Patreon took a small cut, huh..."
13-03-2021T22:46:33,Ordithus,that ain't right
13-03-2021T22:46:35,KatV,huh
13-03-2021T22:46:45,Roughlandin,"""Small cut"""
13-03-2021T22:46:55,FloofyBall,Guess I was very mistaken.
13-03-2021T22:46:58,RheagarsArtEmporium,well i must get to bed myself goodnight my fellow art enthusiasts
13-03-2021T22:47:08,KeefMcDerpface,night Rheagars

13-03-2021T22:47:27,Roughlandin,"Oh yeah, keef. I finally got my first two stimulus checks and figured the first thing I'd spend it on was subbing to Tom"
13-03-2021T22:47:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night
13-03-2021T22:47:40,Roughlandin,"Night Kat, Rhaegar"
13-03-2021T22:47:41,KatV,I got stiffed out of stimulus
13-03-2021T22:47:58,KeefMcDerpface,So you didn't steal gold from a leprechaun?
13-03-2021T22:48:04,Roughlandin,I got held up for months because I didn't have to file taxes last year and my bank account changed
13-03-2021T22:48:14,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-adiracoin:
13-03-2021T22:48:14,FenceEqualizer,Crap that sucks.

13-03-2021T22:48:27,steelabjur,"I'll probably do the same, Rough. See if I can finally post again."
13-03-2021T22:48:30,KatV,ye?
13-03-2021T22:48:31,DarthKeidran,"You see. People with app development skills just need to work with Tom, Amenon, and friends to make Tom his own version of Patreon right on the Keenspot site."
13-03-2021T22:48:40,Roughlandin,I filed a return for all of the no money I made this year and they finally got my new bank account
13-03-2021T22:49:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Nighty night y'all, thanks  again for the stram Tom o/"

13-03-2021T22:51:52,DarthKeidran,"@Roughlandin, that‚Äôs what I thought. Make his own version of Patreon or DA on the Keenspot site. Could call it TwoBucks ;-)"
13-03-2021T22:52:34,Twokinds,"Well, I don't have any technical know how."
13-03-2021T22:52:48,DarthKeidran,Just need to figure out the subscription infrastructure. That‚Äôs where the problem would lie.
13-03-2021T22:52:55,Twokinds,No the ability to handle that kind of infastructure or bill handling.
13-03-2021T22:52:59,Twokinds,You gotta go through someone.
13-03-2021T22:53:19,Ordithus,patreon does offer a good service. they are just butts about it
13-03-2021T22:53:44,Twokinds,"Yeah, people still like to use it. So for now, I'm gunna stick it out with them."
13-03-2021T22:54:02,Twokinds,Someday a competitor might come along and I'll consider it.
13-03-2021T22:54:09,InTheLionsDen,They were set up to handle payments but now want to police the content.
13-03-2021T22:54:25,DarthKeidran,Hopefully someone in the community could help design a better system for you.
13-03-2021T22:54:25,Roughlandin,They follow the money. Same as everybody
13-03-2021T22:54:34,ProsePro7,There is Subscribe Stat
13-03-2021T22:54:36,MuonNeutrino,it looked like they basically said 'no nudity'?
13-03-2021T22:54:40,ProsePro7,Star
13-03-2021T22:54:43,ZapiliDver,Main problem is payment processing
13-03-2021T22:54:50,ZapiliDver,It's a real pain in ass
13-03-2021T22:55:11,Roughlandin,"Honestly if that's what they consider nudity, you might as well start doing true adult art, Tom lol"
13-03-2021T22:55:16,Roughlandin,Jk
13-03-2021T22:55:20,Roughlandin,...Unless??
13-03-2021T22:55:21,DarthKeidran,"Yep. Once that is figured out, Amenon can help set the site up for it I imagine."
13-03-2021T22:55:40,DarthKeidran,The payment processing that is. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
13-03-2021T22:55:46,ProsePro7,Darth over here fixing problems
13-03-2021T22:56:02,DarthKeidran,That‚Äôs weird. It was meant to be the face palm emoji
13-03-2021T22:56:08,ZapiliDver,"But keep in mind all crap about payments, taxes and so on, local laws of all countries... ewww, nightmare"
13-03-2021T22:56:11,MuonNeutrino,"of course, if people are giving you their credit card details that suddenly imposes a much heavier burden of security on you"
13-03-2021T22:56:36,ProsePro7,And ease of access with Patreon having an app
13-03-2021T22:56:38,Roughlandin,Everybody just venmo him the money!
13-03-2021T22:56:41,DarthKeidran,True. Using Paypal may be an easier method.
13-03-2021T22:56:48,ZapiliDver,"Most easy way is paypal only processing, but paypal is a crap too"
13-03-2021T22:56:52,DarthKeidran,"Or Venmo, or Bitcoin."
13-03-2021T22:57:10,ProsePro7,Bitcoin might be a little advanced for some
13-03-2021T22:57:17,Ordithus,"and slow, and expensive"
13-03-2021T22:57:21,MuonNeutrino,yeah paypal does shady and/or erratic stuff with people's money at times as well
13-03-2021T22:57:51,DarthKeidran,"Alas, so many companies are pains in the keister."
13-03-2021T22:58:01,ZapiliDver,BTW i've spend 3 years to explain paypal who i am.
13-03-2021T22:58:08,Roughlandin,Mine boys! Mine Tom that coin!
13-03-2021T22:58:09,ProsePro7,Cause they are monopolies no competition
13-03-2021T22:58:22,Roughlandin,"Grab a pick boys! Quick, boys!"
13-03-2021T22:58:39,ProsePro7,Dig and dig and dig and dig and we dig
13-03-2021T22:58:39,DarthKeidran,Yes @Roughlandin ‚ÄúTwoKoin‚Äù
13-03-2021T22:58:50,DarthKeidran,XD
13-03-2021T22:58:54,Roughlandin,Say what you want about Pochahontas. The music was damn catchy
13-03-2021T22:59:07,KeefMcDerpface,I'm just gonna use explosives...
13-03-2021T22:59:11,DarthKeidran,Watch Elon‚Äôs DogeCoin go DX
13-03-2021T22:59:23,ProsePro7,I got some doge
13-03-2021T22:59:35,Roughlandin,I hardly have real money lol
13-03-2021T23:00:06,DarthKeidran,I‚Äôm being facetious by the way. I do hope it works out for Elon and Tesla because it will work out for the average person who has it.
13-03-2021T23:00:57,Roughlandin,Here's hoping. I'm sticking clear because I've seen to much of these get rich easy things blow up in people's faces
13-03-2021T23:01:08,ProsePro7,Still problem with electric is recharge time.  But I saw a system that swaps out batteries like AAs that might make them practical
13-03-2021T23:01:18,DarthKeidran,OK. I am going to try and waddle over to bed. My feet are asleep.
13-03-2021T23:01:30,KeefMcDerpface,"night Darth, again"
13-03-2021T23:01:36,DarthKeidran,Yerp
13-03-2021T23:01:40,steelabjur,You know what I dislike most about Patreon? Monthly payment only. Give me the option to pay annually or yearly while I got the money. :p
13-03-2021T23:01:41,ProsePro7,By Darth hope the rest of ya falls asleep too
13-03-2021T23:02:03,Roughlandin,Night Darth!
13-03-2021T23:02:07,ZapiliDver,bb Darth
13-03-2021T23:02:12,DarthKeidran,Hopefully not before I am able to make it to the bedroom!
13-03-2021T23:03:07,DarthKeidran,ZZZZzzzzz! Didn‚Äôt make it. Zzzzzz. Corporate lunacy. Zzzz.
13-03-2021T23:03:20,Roughlandin,Hope the floor is comfy Darth lol
13-03-2021T23:03:54,DarthKeidran,"Unfortunately, the floor isn‚Äôt like Heartman‚Äôs from Death Stranding‚Ä¶"
13-03-2021T23:04:15,DarthKeidran,That‚Äôs a good game by the way.
13-03-2021T23:04:37,Roughlandin,I need to play it sometime
13-03-2021T23:04:44,KeefMcDerpface,Now or after getting through the slow stuff?
13-03-2021T23:04:48,Twokinds,Is it? I feel like it came out and then I heard nothing about it.
13-03-2021T23:04:53,KeefMcDerpface,samew
13-03-2021T23:04:55,KeefMcDerpface,*same
13-03-2021T23:05:31,Roughlandin,I've heard there's a lot of walking but that's kind of the point
13-03-2021T23:05:32,AspiringNoodle,According to Dadro it's a game that's not for everyone
13-03-2021T23:05:42,AspiringNoodle,But those who do enjoy it will have a blast
13-03-2021T23:05:48,KeefMcDerpface,"Yeah, I figured."
13-03-2021T23:06:02,Roughlandin,I like slow contemplative stuff
13-03-2021T23:06:03,AspiringNoodle,"More or less, you need to be down for whatever weirdness Kojima dreamed up."
13-03-2021T23:06:19,Roughlandin,I love Red Dead 2. I like to just pretend I'm camping in the wilderness lol
13-03-2021T23:06:44,Ordithus,Tom I got something for you to add to the pile. Could you post some rules here on picarto for people? I've been asked a few times about that.
13-03-2021T23:06:59,Roughlandin,Yeah OmniOtter was asking about it earlier
13-03-2021T23:07:09,KeefMcDerpface,Could make it a command for the bot?
13-03-2021T23:07:10,ProsePro7,How to not be Ban Hammered By Ordithus
13-03-2021T23:07:18,DarthKeidran,"Yes @TwoKinds. It is pretty good in my opinion. You don‚Äôt directly play with other players, but equipment you build can show up on other people‚Äôs maps."
13-03-2021T23:07:47,Twokinds,huh?
13-03-2021T23:08:12,KeefMcDerpface,"heh, I remember someone just leaving ladders everywhere hopping for one to appear in another's game."
13-03-2021T23:08:17,DarthKeidran,There is a ton of walking at the beginning. You‚Äôre playing as some kind of post apocalyptic FedEx guy basically.
13-03-2021T23:08:30,Roughlandin,You can build a ladder bridge and it'll shot up in somebody else's game. Kind of like dropping equipment in the Dark Souls games
13-03-2021T23:08:36,Roughlandin,show up
13-03-2021T23:08:48,ProsePro7,Amazon Prime Simulator is what I kept hearing people call it
13-03-2021T23:08:51,Twokinds,Rules are: Don't be a idiot.
13-03-2021T23:08:54,DarthKeidran,But it does have a bit of a horror aspect game due to the monsters in the games being like ghosts.
13-03-2021T23:08:59,AspiringNoodle,Got it
13-03-2021T23:09:02,ProsePro7,Very specific
13-03-2021T23:09:03,AspiringNoodle,*sticks fork in power socket*
13-03-2021T23:09:12,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-shock: Noodle!!
13-03-2021T23:09:23,Roughlandin,OmniOtter got worried because somebody told them not to mention e621 and they were afraid they'd get banned
13-03-2021T23:09:24,ZapiliDver,cleaning ear with a nail....
13-03-2021T23:09:31,ProsePro7,"Add to that ""dont poke the Tom when tired""...I learned that one the hard way"
13-03-2021T23:09:32,DarthKeidran,And some moments when you are dragged off into WWI and WWII type battlefields.
13-03-2021T23:09:42,Twokinds,Yes don't bring up porn sites. That should be obvious.
13-03-2021T23:10:09,Twokinds,That falls under don't be an idiot.
13-03-2021T23:10:17,steelabjur,So the equipment is sort of like the floor messages in Dark Souls?
13-03-2021T23:10:25,KeefMcDerpface,"In a way, yes."
13-03-2021T23:10:26,DarthKeidran,"General rule is don‚Äôt link anything unless it‚Äôs something Tom has made, or something you‚Äôve been granted permission from a mod to post."
13-03-2021T23:10:34,Roughlandin,That's basically what I told him. He mentioned he also PMed Ord and Teddy about it
13-03-2021T23:10:35,ProsePro7,"Lets see,  Be excellent to one another, dont be idiot, no porn discussions, no politics....what else?"
13-03-2021T23:10:46,Roughlandin,I think he's just new and got worried
13-03-2021T23:10:47,BadFoMo,"You mean like these? [Link Auto Remived.], [Link Auto Remived.], [Link Auto Remived.], and [Link Auto Remived.]?"
13-03-2021T23:11:02,ZapiliDver,Maybe ctrl-c/ctrl-v rules from Sage will be ok?
13-03-2021T23:11:03,DarthKeidran,You should whisper one of the mods before sending links to other stuff.
13-03-2021T23:11:29,Ordithus,omni is far from the first to ask
13-03-2021T23:11:56,Roughlandin,True
13-03-2021T23:12:10,Ordithus,seems I was in the shower when this went down anyways
13-03-2021T23:12:11,BadFoMo,No abnocshos spaming?
13-03-2021T23:12:26,KeefMcDerpface,"yeah, you came back after the factr."
13-03-2021T23:12:28,KeefMcDerpface,*fact
13-03-2021T23:12:35,Twokinds,Just be cooool
13-03-2021T23:12:44,Ordithus,Be excellent to each other~
13-03-2021T23:12:46,KeefMcDerpface,Like 30 seconds.
13-03-2021T23:12:46,CrRAR,:cw0lfmare-Paperembercool:
13-03-2021T23:12:48,Roughlandin,It really wasn't that big a deal. Omni mentioned e621 offhand. Somebody told him that was a no no. He got really worried for some reason
13-03-2021T23:13:09,Twokinds,Smooth moves
13-03-2021T23:13:10,Roughlandin,The Golden Rule: Be cool. Don't be a dick.
13-03-2021T23:13:42,KeefMcDerpface,"And if you are gonna be one, don't."
13-03-2021T23:13:45,KeefMcDerpface,Just don't.
13-03-2021T23:13:55,Roughlandin,You kinda get the vibe with new folk of who is gonna stick around and who isn't gonna make it through the night.
13-03-2021T23:14:02,ProsePro7,If you want the rules ask a mod or one of us old timers
13-03-2021T23:14:30,Roughlandin,And Ord and Teddy are super cool about warning people before they bring down the hammer
13-03-2021T23:14:41,Roughlandin,Unless people just come in spamming and being jerks
13-03-2021T23:14:44,ZapiliDver,Wanna get banned? Ask me howto! =)
13-03-2021T23:14:55,ProsePro7,Or me.  Ban Brothers!
13-03-2021T23:15:12,DarthKeidran,Connect with a USB?
13-03-2021T23:15:13,Roughlandin,I think Ord nearly kicked me on my first night lol
13-03-2021T23:15:22,DarthKeidran,Universal Serial Banner
13-03-2021T23:15:31,ProsePro7,I remember that I can remember what you did Rough
13-03-2021T23:15:35,InTheLionsDen,Nearly? Try harder next time.
13-03-2021T23:15:40,KeefMcDerpface,lol
13-03-2021T23:15:50,ZapiliDver,Join da club :D
13-03-2021T23:15:56,Roughlandin,I think I got excited and was caps spamming
13-03-2021T23:15:59,ProsePro7,We have T shirts
13-03-2021T23:16:04,Roughlandin,I'm an excitable bear!
13-03-2021T23:16:14,ProsePro7,Oh yea
13-03-2021T23:16:38,Ordithus,it's pretty easy to not get banned
13-03-2021T23:16:40,DarthKeidran,You can get so excited it can be UnBearAble.
13-03-2021T23:16:47,Ordithus,unless you are neon
13-03-2021T23:17:03,Roughlandin,Or you annoy Sage like I seem to...
13-03-2021T23:17:04,KeefMcDerpface,What did Neon do?
13-03-2021T23:17:06,ProsePro7,I havent seen Neon for a while
13-03-2021T23:17:12,Ordithus,Neon: hi! Teddy: ban!!!!
13-03-2021T23:17:14,Ordithus,lol
13-03-2021T23:17:17,Roughlandin,Hahaha
13-03-2021T23:17:31,steelabjur,Never been banned.
13-03-2021T23:17:37,ProsePro7,yet
13-03-2021T23:17:44,KeefMcDerpface,So teddy hates then word 'hi'? Noted.
13-03-2021T23:18:01,Roughlandin,Also saying bad stuff about Kat
13-03-2021T23:18:11,KeefMcDerpface,That's a given.
13-03-2021T23:18:19,ZapiliDver,Or lewdin Raine
13-03-2021T23:18:25,ProsePro7,Yeah there is another one no nasty talk about characters there is a limit
13-03-2021T23:18:55,Roughlandin,"That falls under the ""don't be a dick"" rule"
13-03-2021T23:19:15,ProsePro7,Thats not a rule thats a category
13-03-2021T23:19:54,DarthKeidran,I‚Äôve got lots of post car accident bull crap to deal with tomorrow.
13-03-2021T23:20:01,Roughlandin,Oof sorry Darth
13-03-2021T23:20:03,Ordithus,"yikes, good luck"
13-03-2021T23:20:06,ProsePro7,"We can just make a book ""DA RULES"""
13-03-2021T23:20:22,Roughlandin,Hit em wit da book!
13-03-2021T23:20:43,Ordithus,first all-pick sketch stream went pretty well. I don't think I saw anyone complain?
13-03-2021T23:21:03,Roughlandin,I had fun!
13-03-2021T23:21:07,ZapiliDver,Yea
13-03-2021T23:21:09,InTheLionsDen,"That would fall into the ""don't be a dick"" rule"
13-03-2021T23:21:17,Roughlandin,And everybody seemed cool with it yeah
13-03-2021T23:21:24,DarthKeidran,Truck (F150) rear ended me (Prius Prime). Tow yard says they think it‚Äôs totaled. So my license plate holder might be correct. ‚ÄúMy next car is electric - Tesla‚Äù
13-03-2021T23:21:36,steelabjur,It was an interesting change of pace.
13-03-2021T23:21:41,Roughlandin,"I was waiting for somebody to cry ""no fair"" though. There's always that one guy"
13-03-2021T23:21:48,Ordithus,"wowie. you're alright, though?"
13-03-2021T23:22:04,Roughlandin,Owie Darth
13-03-2021T23:22:31,DarthKeidran,"Soreness in my back where I was injured during Peace Officer Standards Training. And my neck feels misaligned, other than that, I‚Äôm fine."
13-03-2021T23:22:50,BadFoMo,Dang!
13-03-2021T23:22:53,DarthKeidran,My brother on the other hand‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs in rougher shape.
13-03-2021T23:23:00,Ordithus,damn
13-03-2021T23:23:01,Roughlandin,Oh no
13-03-2021T23:23:04,BadFoMo,How bad?
13-03-2021T23:23:06,DarthKeidran,My other brother and friend were unscathed.
13-03-2021T23:23:11,DarthKeidran,Well.
13-03-2021T23:23:24,KeefMcDerpface,"So wait, who was sitting where?"
13-03-2021T23:23:24,DarthKeidran,The idiot in the F150 nailed another car behind us immediately before hitting us.
13-03-2021T23:23:47,DarthKeidran,"I was the driver, my brothers were in the backseat, and my friend was in the passenger seat."
13-03-2021T23:24:38,Roughlandin,Ow sorry Darth
13-03-2021T23:24:47,BadFoMo,How did they hit another car before hitting you?
13-03-2021T23:24:53,DarthKeidran,"The injured brother is still able to get up and move, but because he doesn‚Äôt have insurance or sickleave, he is less inclined to go to the doctors, even though my insurance should cover him until the offending parties insurance pays up."
13-03-2021T23:25:09,InTheLionsDen,Was they truck being a pinball marble with the cars as bumpers?
13-03-2021T23:25:16,DarthKeidran,"I am on sickleave, and may end up on FMLA."
13-03-2021T23:25:24,InTheLionsDen,*the truck
13-03-2021T23:25:45,steelabjur,"Let me guess, hit you only on one side when it rearended you?"
13-03-2021T23:25:46,Ordithus,"hope you and your brother heal well, and soon"
13-03-2021T23:26:00,Roughlandin,Same. All the postive vibes to you guys
13-03-2021T23:26:04,DarthKeidran,"I don‚Äôt know. I just know that we were slowing down because there were two trucks in front of us turning left into a church parking lot, we hear a crash behind us and a car swings out the left lane and then off the side of the road up ahead, and then‚Ä¶"
13-03-2021T23:26:11,DarthKeidran,We get hit immediately afterwards
13-03-2021T23:26:15,BadFoMo,"Yes, may you all get well soon."
13-03-2021T23:26:20,ZapiliDver,With all best wishes.
13-03-2021T23:26:43,DarthKeidran,"A little bit more on one side, but it was fairly square on."
13-03-2021T23:27:17,steelabjur,"Yeesh, sounds like somebody was going over the limit or wasn't paying attention and couldn't stop in time."
13-03-2021T23:27:56,DarthKeidran,"I don‚Äôt think he was going over the speed limit. By the time that I got hit I was down to less than 5 mph. There is the possibility though, because the person in the first vehicle that got hit was pretty banged up."
13-03-2021T23:28:15,Roughlandin,Cars hit hard even going slow
13-03-2021T23:28:31,Ordithus,a crash at 30 is crazy violent
13-03-2021T23:28:45,InTheLionsDen,The truck had mass on its side. Doesn't always need speed.
13-03-2021T23:29:12,ZapiliDver,"Awww, russian most popular videos: crashes from car dashcam."
13-03-2021T23:29:19,DarthKeidran,"He probably hit us at about 20 to 30 mph. I had half the trunk space I used to have, some of that trunk space was my car‚Äôs traction battery."
13-03-2021T23:29:53,Ordithus,yeah that much damage it is definitely totaled. car gave what it could to protect you
13-03-2021T23:29:57,KeefMcDerpface,"""Traction battery""? That sounds important."
13-03-2021T23:30:13,DarthKeidran,"I honestly won‚Äôt be shocked if it goes up in flames sometime while in the tow yard, my car was made back during the same time the Tesla‚Äôs were exploding two or three days after accidents."
13-03-2021T23:30:14,InTheLionsDen,Prius > hybrid
13-03-2021T23:30:42,ZapiliDver,"Afaik old priuses have HiMh batteries, that generally safe."
13-03-2021T23:30:51,ZapiliDver,Don't know about new ones
13-03-2021T23:31:11,DarthKeidran,"The traction battery is the EV battery. It would get me, when brand new, about 25 miles of range. During winter, lately, only about 17. This was a 2017 Prius Prime Advanced."
13-03-2021T23:31:14,ZapiliDver,Tesla and most of modern electric cars have LiIon
13-03-2021T23:32:06,ZapiliDver,It 2017 with LiIon.
13-03-2021T23:32:36,Ordithus,amazingly efficient car
13-03-2021T23:33:06,DarthKeidran,"It was pretty nice too. I had remote starting for my HVAC. I could check my battery charge remotely. And with my 50 mile round-trip commute every day, I had about 70 miles to the gallon."
13-03-2021T23:33:10,Ordithus,"I'm considering a Chevy Volt or latest gen Honda Insight this year, maybe"
13-03-2021T23:34:40,DarthKeidran,I‚Äôm looking at getting a Tesla model 3 as my replacement because they cost about what I paid for my car.
13-03-2021T23:34:54,DarthKeidran,"Financing was about $37,000"
13-03-2021T23:36:42,Ordithus,those seem pretty nice. would love to have one
13-03-2021T23:36:49,DarthKeidran,"Insight starts at 23,000. Not half bad fuel economy."
13-03-2021T23:37:13,DarthKeidran,The Volt seems to have been discontinued in 2020.
13-03-2021T23:37:29,Ordithus,"yeah, I'd be buying used for either"
13-03-2021T23:37:29,Roughlandin,Urgh. I have a lab I actually have to go onto campus for tomorrow
13-03-2021T23:37:37,KeefMcDerpface,night?
13-03-2021T23:37:40,InTheLionsDen,"Yes, A friend has a Volt and likes it. Don't recall what year it was."
13-03-2021T23:37:43,DarthKeidran,"It had, if I recall, about 50 mile charge."
13-03-2021T23:37:53,Ordithus,"about that, yeah"
13-03-2021T23:37:58,Roughlandin,Yeah I should probably head out. Night everybody!

13-03-2021T23:39:23,KeefMcDerpface,They're pretty quick.
13-03-2021T23:41:25,ZapiliDver,"bb All, gonna sleep for a few hours"
13-03-2021T23:41:27,DarthKeidran,"@Ordithus, the Volt‚Äôs MSRP was $40,000. You can get a low end Model 3 for less than that."
13-03-2021T23:41:35,Ordithus,night zap
13-03-2021T23:41:35,DarthKeidran,Night Zap!
13-03-2021T23:41:36,KeefMcDerpface,haha
13-03-2021T23:41:42,KeefMcDerpface,night Zapili
13-03-2021T23:41:46,Ordithus,they cost $15k lightly used
13-03-2021T23:42:00,Ordithus,can't get a model 3 for that money
13-03-2021T23:42:03,DarthKeidran,Oof that depreciation stings.
13-03-2021T23:42:22,Ordithus,"terrible for the first owner, great for anyone else"
13-03-2021T23:42:27,KeefMcDerpface,lol
13-03-2021T23:42:32,KeefMcDerpface,Sad but true
13-03-2021T23:42:32,DarthKeidran,Is that the 2019 one?
13-03-2021T23:42:50,Ordithus,I think 2nd gen started 2017
13-03-2021T23:44:53,steelabjur,"G'night guys, think I'll hit that old dusty trail..."
13-03-2021T23:44:59,KeefMcDerpface,night steel
13-03-2021T23:45:03,Ordithus,night!
13-03-2021T23:45:13,DarthKeidran,Night!
13-03-2021T23:45:36,DarthKeidran,Yeesh. KBB prices 2019 ones almost that low (16k-18k).
13-03-2021T23:46:06,KeefMcDerpface,"Yeah, cars lose a good chunk of value when they leave the lot."
13-03-2021T23:46:18,DarthKeidran,Oh. That‚Äôs trade in. Up to 20-22k for private party.
13-03-2021T23:46:57,DarthKeidran,"That‚Äôs, just, ouch. Even my car didn‚Äôt depreciate that much until I got rear ended."
13-03-2021T23:47:18,Ordithus,they depreciated more in a couple years than my current car was worth new
13-03-2021T23:48:04,DarthKeidran,"I‚Äôd say. Dropping almost 20,000 in less than two years. Good grief."
13-03-2021T23:48:31,Ordithus,does make you wonder if there is some major flaw or something
13-03-2021T23:48:38,ProsePro7,Alright ya'll I'm gone.  Enjoy see ya next week

13-03-2021T23:49:28,DarthKeidran,Yeah. I almost think that is the case. KBB indicates 2 recalls.
13-03-2021T23:49:54,DarthKeidran,Seat belts and brakes‚Ä¶
13-03-2021T23:50:04,DarthKeidran,Those are kind of important I think.
13-03-2021T23:50:11,DarthKeidran,Especially after my experience last week
13-03-2021T23:51:48,Ordithus,I am also well versed in the importance of seatbelts
13-03-2021T23:52:05,Ordithus,lost my first car in a roll over. I was fine!
13-03-2021T23:52:14,KeefMcDerpface,\o/
13-03-2021T23:52:28,DarthKeidran,Oof. That probably was fun in all the wrong ways.
13-03-2021T23:52:40,Ordithus,didn't last long enough to be fun
13-03-2021T23:52:46,KeefMcDerpface,wut
13-03-2021T23:53:13,Ordithus,"was just ""oh crap"" BANG and then I was upside down in a farm field"
13-03-2021T23:53:27,DarthKeidran,I tipped a dump truck once.
13-03-2021T23:53:43,KeefMcDerpface,Do I want to know the story?
13-03-2021T23:53:51,DarthKeidran,I was working on a farm.
13-03-2021T23:54:20,DarthKeidran,The farmer had me dumping dirt from the potato harvest in an area he was filling in.
13-03-2021T23:54:47,DarthKeidran,"The back tipped up, a wheel was in a soft spot, the rest is history."
13-03-2021T23:55:36,DarthKeidran,"The terrifying part, I though I was going to be stuck in the truck because the muffler liked to stop the passenger door from opening."
13-03-2021T23:55:49,KeefMcDerpface,Oh gosh.
13-03-2021T23:56:14,KeefMcDerpface,"Well, you can try to bust out the windshield."
13-03-2021T23:56:24,DarthKeidran,"Luckily, I had bent it back not long before the accident."
13-03-2021T23:56:31,KeefMcDerpface,good
13-03-2021T23:56:45,DarthKeidran,I forgot I did it though in the heat of the moment.
13-03-2021T23:57:25,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
13-03-2021T23:57:52,DarthKeidran,"I have, like, 10 songs going through my head right now."
13-03-2021T23:57:58,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-nibsdance: dance nibs dance
13-03-2021T23:57:59,DarthKeidran,Thanks Tom.
