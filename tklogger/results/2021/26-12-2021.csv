26-12-2021T00:19:34,tecbot,honestly despite the time travel story is quite straighfoward the problem  isa that is fragmented over several games

26-12-2021T19:44:16,Twokinds,Just need nibbly to come along with the mistletoe attached to her collar.

26-12-2021T19:45:13,bluehairedshepsky,"Like, he and Maren are going for a kiss and BAM, there's Nibbly with the mistletoe intercepting the kiss x)"
26-12-2021T19:45:15,MisterWho,Purrfect idea!
26-12-2021T19:45:37,unsteddyphoenix,Decking the halls- with kissing couples
26-12-2021T19:45:51,MviluUatusun,"Now, that sounds like a suggestion for a stream, bluehaired."

26-12-2021T19:48:33,BadFoMo,@bluehairedshepsky Inb4 Nibbly is kissed by Maren? Nibbly: SQUEAK! Squeak squeak squeak! (Ah! I've been kissed by a Human! I have Human germs!)
26-12-2021T19:48:47,Azartalien,It's Just a Burning Memory
26-12-2021T19:49:12,bluehairedshepsky,That or Maren and Raine get caught by the Mistletoe x)
26-12-2021T19:49:35,bluehairedshepsky,Much to the chagrin of Red and to the amusement of Sythe
26-12-2021T19:49:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Red and Sythe under the Mistletoe 
26-12-2021T19:51:03,Almighty404,Ms Nibbly and Nora under the mistletoe would be amusing.
26-12-2021T19:51:06,bluehairedshepsky,"Blindfold prank, where both Sythe and Red are blindfolded and think they're kissing Maren and Raine"
26-12-2021T19:51:21,unsteddyphoenix,Kinda missed the boat on mistletoe requests lol
26-12-2021T19:51:28,bluehairedshepsky,"That'd just wind up with Nibbly getting eaten, isn't she scared of Dragons?"
26-12-2021T19:51:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,True teddy
26-12-2021T19:51:46,bluehairedshepsky,Maybe next Christmas!
26-12-2021T19:51:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Sythe and red just bro smooching then
26-12-2021T19:51:52,SpaceCadety,Depends on why she's afraid of dragons.
26-12-2021T19:51:52,BadFoMo,@unsteddyphoenix We're planing for next year.
26-12-2021T19:52:16,Almighty404,"Or just throwing out silly ideas, like I am."
26-12-2021T19:52:19,ThingsAreMoving,Mistletoe needs to rest
26-12-2021T19:52:19,microbuss,I'd rather eat cookies with milk

26-12-2021T19:53:36,w0lfmare,Yeah
26-12-2021T19:53:40,SpaceCadety,Nibbs might be scared of dragons because her cover would be blown.
26-12-2021T19:53:52,w0lfmare,Likely outside of request range
26-12-2021T19:54:33,bluehairedshepsky,"I believe Tom doesn't do personal OC's as requests or in general, but I would love to see Michelle and Mikhail (Twins) in Tom's style"

26-12-2021T20:51:09,MoonDance,So Encanto on Disney+ is pretty good if anyone wants to watch
