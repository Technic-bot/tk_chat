02-03-2021T00:00:03,Ordithus,w0lf this page really is slapstick
02-03-2021T00:00:14,Ordithus,and was that a Bernin blush
02-03-2021T00:00:37,w0lfmare,Maybe
02-03-2021T00:00:41,w0lfmare,:cw0lfmare-Paperember:
02-03-2021T00:00:54,ArkanaCat,seems this page was rewitten recently
02-03-2021T00:01:30,Twokinds,I still can't believe Photoshop took away the line tool.
02-03-2021T00:01:51,TheSexyBeast,Going to reload the page in hopes it improves the connectivity
02-03-2021T00:02:03,w0lfmare,What would you need lines for Tom
02-03-2021T00:02:12,w0lfmare,Sounds optional
02-03-2021T00:02:18,Dadrobit,"""Draw your own lines!"" -Photoshop evidently"
02-03-2021T00:03:05,unsteddyphoenix,That was a joke right?
02-03-2021T00:03:15,w0lfmare,Yeah that was a joke
02-03-2021T00:03:24,w0lfmare,Laugh plz
02-03-2021T00:03:33,w0lfmare,:cw0lfmare-Embersafe:
02-03-2021T00:03:41,unsteddyphoenix,No like
02-03-2021T00:03:50,Ordithus,all true artists can hand draw a perfect fibbonaci spiral
02-03-2021T00:03:54,Dadrobit,"""please clap"""
02-03-2021T00:04:05,unsteddyphoenix,Photoshop didnt actually remove line tool did they
02-03-2021T00:04:43,Twokinds,Yup
02-03-2021T00:04:46,Twokinds,The Pixel line tool
02-03-2021T00:04:58,Twokinds,Now you can only make vector lines.
02-03-2021T00:05:07,Twokinds,"But if you just want to draw a simple line, the pixel option is greyed out now."
02-03-2021T00:05:17,swack24,woo mega man sound
02-03-2021T00:05:19,Dadrobit,That..
02-03-2021T00:05:26,unsteddyphoenix,"Its not gone, just greyed out??"
02-03-2021T00:05:32,Dadrobit,That may in fact be the dumbest thing.
02-03-2021T00:05:38,unsteddyphoenix,Thats such an...out of touch corporation thing to do
02-03-2021T00:05:40,Twokinds,They say it's to bring it in line with their other products
02-03-2021T00:05:48,Ordithus,heh
02-03-2021T00:05:49,Ordithus,line
02-03-2021T00:05:57,unsteddyphoenix,heh
02-03-2021T00:06:07,TheSexyBeast,heh
02-03-2021T00:06:17,Twokinds,"To make a pixel line now, you have to use the vector line tool, set a weight, then rastorize it. One step per line is now 3, yaaay"
02-03-2021T00:06:23,microbuss,gets road rollered flat!
02-03-2021T00:06:27,microbuss,meeeep
02-03-2021T00:06:31,Dadrobit,Why? Do the other products not have pixel line options? Why not just add it to the other programs instead of removing it from the one?
02-03-2021T00:06:33,BadFoMo,Yo.
02-03-2021T00:06:39,Ordithus,hi fomo
02-03-2021T00:06:46,microbuss,hi fomo
02-03-2021T00:06:47,Dadrobit,o/ FoMo
02-03-2021T00:06:51,Twokinds,I don't know.
02-03-2021T00:06:53,TheSexyBeast,👋 FoMo
02-03-2021T00:06:59,Twokinds,And it seems like they're being really stubborn on it.
02-03-2021T00:07:07,unsteddyphoenix,how bizzare
02-03-2021T00:07:17,FloofyCat,Guarantee some other changes broke it and someone got annoyed after spending hours trying to fix it and gave up.
02-03-2021T00:07:38,microbuss,well its after 10pm I better go to bed I guess
02-03-2021T00:07:45,IronHorseComics,oh yeah that stupidity
02-03-2021T00:07:48,microbuss,cyas
02-03-2021T00:07:49,TheSexyBeast,Top down design never works well
02-03-2021T00:07:49,Dadrobit,That's legitimately incomprehensibly unreasonable.
02-03-2021T00:08:03,IronHorseComics,"Adobe's been on a ""it's not broke so let's fix it"" trend lately"
02-03-2021T00:08:14,BadFoMo,"I didn't really catch the whole talk, but I too hate it when oprions are taken away/ things are made harder."
02-03-2021T00:08:37,FloofyCat,Features are usually easier than bugfixes x3
02-03-2021T00:08:42,BadFoMo,*options
02-03-2021T00:08:57,IronHorseComics,whoever greenlit that decision needs a case of Ms. Nibbly to the nuts
02-03-2021T00:09:53,IronHorseComics,"also their in line with other products is bullshit, if they truly cared about that they would have put the transformation tool back to how it used to work a long time ago"
02-03-2021T00:09:56,ChromaticBard,lol
02-03-2021T00:10:14,IronHorseComics,"and all of those other programs are vector programs, not raster like photoshop"
02-03-2021T00:10:25,Ordithus,"words right outta my fingers, iron"
02-03-2021T00:11:19,Ordithus,:eyes: dang kame this is really looking cool
02-03-2021T00:11:42,BadFoMo,I'm reminded of DA's latest update.
02-03-2021T00:11:58,TheSexyBeast,Why do software companies always come down with a case of dumb when they get so big?
02-03-2021T00:12:17,IronHorseComics,I think that's the case with most companies
02-03-2021T00:12:22,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,Hmm... Three streams in a row? That’s impressive. Hi everyone
02-03-2021T00:12:28,BadFoMo,Because they're that detatched?
02-03-2021T00:12:29,Ordithus,o/
02-03-2021T00:12:32,BadFoMo,Yo.
02-03-2021T00:12:37,IronHorseComics,they're out of touch with reality
02-03-2021T00:12:51,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,How is everyone?
02-03-2021T00:12:54,Twokinds,"Part of me cynically thinks they tool the line tool away so they can ""fix"" it with the next version"
02-03-2021T00:12:58,Twokinds,Gives them something to do.
02-03-2021T00:13:06,AspiringNoodle,"Oh, you KNOW that's what they're gonna do"
02-03-2021T00:13:15,Dadrobit,Shout out to MS Paint for keeping it real all these years!
02-03-2021T00:13:16,TheSexyBeast,👋 TB
02-03-2021T00:13:18,AspiringNoodle,Their suite of products are complete.
02-03-2021T00:13:21,IronHorseComics,"they better ""fix it"" quickly, it's stuck around for too long as is"
02-03-2021T00:13:22,unsteddyphoenix,"Remove features, add them back in next version"
02-03-2021T00:13:22,BadFoMo,"I'm fine, you?"
02-03-2021T00:13:25,unsteddyphoenix,And makes BILLIONS
02-03-2021T00:13:29,AspiringNoodle,"They need to ""justify"" keeping those developers around."
02-03-2021T00:14:01,TerrifyingBoiofficiall,"Little tired, only 2 hours of rest. But I’m pretty well"
02-03-2021T00:14:15,IronHorseComics,"how about using those developers to try to make actual new useful features, as much as I didn't like CSP I did like their perspective rulers and how that worked"
02-03-2021T00:14:19,TheSexyBeast,"""We know what's best for the consumer!"""
02-03-2021T00:14:20,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, when Adobe switched over to the subscription model, it was purely because they can't add enough features or improvements to justify keeping the CS model alive."
02-03-2021T00:15:00,AspiringNoodle,"So it's a win-win for them.  Improve their revenue, make it more consistent, AND they can cut back on development costs."
02-03-2021T00:15:22,BadFoMo,"""We'll market it as 'NEW Slerm'! Then, when everone hates it, we'll bring back old Slerm as 'Slerm Classic' and make Billions!"""
02-03-2021T00:15:47,Ordithus,slurm
02-03-2021T00:15:52,Ordithus,but yes muahaha
02-03-2021T00:15:53,IronHorseComics,they still haven't repaired the damage to their transformation tool
02-03-2021T00:15:58,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-adiracoin:
02-03-2021T00:15:59,BlueStreak98,"As Coke said, ""We're not that stupid, and we're not that smart."""
02-03-2021T00:16:03,IronHorseComics,"it's been a problem for what, two years now?"
02-03-2021T00:16:13,TheSexyBeast,Slerm = Coke. I got that reference.
02-03-2021T00:16:21,BadFoMo,Thanks; I knew that looked wrong.
02-03-2021T00:16:23,Dadrobit,"Genuine question. I am unfamiliar with the PS suite. Do they offer different ""tiers"" for the same program? Like a ""Student"" ""Standard"" and ""Professional"" option like some other programs?"
02-03-2021T00:16:52,IronHorseComics,I don't remember there being much of a difference
02-03-2021T00:17:07,IronHorseComics,just in cost is all
02-03-2021T00:17:23,Twokinds,No
02-03-2021T00:17:41,AspiringNoodle,how much does Photoshop cost? $10 a month?
02-03-2021T00:17:41,Twokinds,The programs themselves don't have different versions
02-03-2021T00:18:02,Twokinds,Their tiers are purely how many programs you get.
02-03-2021T00:18:16,Twokinds,"And yeah, I pay $10 per month for photoshop"
02-03-2021T00:18:34,AspiringNoodle,"And how many of their ""updates"" have been worth taking?"
02-03-2021T00:18:42,IronHorseComics,"I'm supposed to pay like 70, but I pay 40 still and I get EVERYTHING"
02-03-2021T00:18:49,Ordithus,I will headcanon that as my $10 :ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
02-03-2021T00:18:55,unsteddyphoenix,One of us pays for photoshop
02-03-2021T00:18:55,Ordithus,you're welcome Tom
02-03-2021T00:18:58,ChromaticBard,lol
02-03-2021T00:19:05,IronHorseComics,Illustrator is still insanely useful to me especially as a graphic designer
02-03-2021T00:19:05,unsteddyphoenix,Mine is two burritos
02-03-2021T00:19:06,Twokinds,Thanks!
02-03-2021T00:19:43,ChromaticBard,XD
02-03-2021T00:19:48,TheSexyBeast,Photoshop has been around so long now that they've gone from being the hero to the villain
02-03-2021T00:20:10,IronHorseComics,the sad part is they still deserve to be the industry standard
02-03-2021T00:21:03,Dadrobit,:/ I am jelly. Avid are a buncha fuckers for their program pricing schemes. Wanna mix in surround instead of stereo? Completely different price tier. $800 up front and $80 a month afterwards.
02-03-2021T00:21:08,Twokinds,"It's good software, they just make boneheaded moves. And also, the program's become so bloated I think they have trouble with it, considering all the bugs every update."
02-03-2021T00:21:21,ChromaticBard,I got the suite for a few more months while I'm still at my HS. Found out that it was available with our school emails from my  Digital Design teacher barely a few weeks ago
02-03-2021T00:21:23,Dadrobit,"Same program, just a few more ""nice to haves"""
02-03-2021T00:21:28,ChromaticBard,I wish I knew about that sooner
02-03-2021T00:21:37,Twokinds,"Photoshop 2021 was extremely poor, regarding bugs."
02-03-2021T00:21:39,IronHorseComics,Krita's a good animate alternative
02-03-2021T00:21:50,Twokinds,But they have tools no other program does
02-03-2021T00:22:09,Kameloh,would you ever use anything else like CSP?
02-03-2021T00:22:10,IronHorseComics,and a much wider brush selection
02-03-2021T00:22:37,Twokinds,I tried CSP a long time ago
02-03-2021T00:22:48,Twokinds,"I dunno if things are better now, but they lacked a lot of basic stuff I use regularly."
02-03-2021T00:23:01,Twokinds,They didn't even have alignment tools.
02-03-2021T00:23:31,Kameloh,"hm, it may be better now, but I haven't used CSP enough to know"
02-03-2021T00:23:40,Kameloh,I'm going to switch to it once I'm done with these two paintings
02-03-2021T00:23:42,IronHorseComics,I wouldn't use them for graphic design... or comic lettering
02-03-2021T00:24:03,w0lfmare,They have perspective snap grids
02-03-2021T00:24:13,w0lfmare,But I've never tried those
02-03-2021T00:24:27,AspiringNoodle,Where's Sage when you need him? xD
02-03-2021T00:24:30,TheSexyBeast,It would be nice if some up and coming software company made a better Photoshop with all the wanted features without the bloat
02-03-2021T00:24:49,IronHorseComics,oh he'll just be a CSP snob and make up whatever trick in the book to make you think CSP is better
02-03-2021T00:24:54,AspiringNoodle,Funny you mention that...
02-03-2021T00:25:15,AspiringNoodle,Affinity Photo by Serif :3
02-03-2021T00:25:38,Twokinds,I have my eye on affinity photo
02-03-2021T00:26:18,AspiringNoodle,I kinda wish I had gotten that instead of CSP a while back.
02-03-2021T00:26:42,AspiringNoodle,"Before I built this computer, I was testing both to see what their tools and performance were like."
02-03-2021T00:26:48,Twokinds,The first program to have an ai-driven auto-inking mechnic will take me away instantly. XD
02-03-2021T00:26:54,ChromaticBard,Welp gotta start wrapping up for the night. Cya all!
02-03-2021T00:27:01,Dadrobit,o/ Bard
02-03-2021T00:27:01,Ordithus,night bard
02-03-2021T00:27:03,IronHorseComics,"if you ever wanted to animate, Krita's my go to. Photoshop's animation functionality could best be described as ""hot garbage"" and Animate still feels unintuitive"
02-03-2021T00:27:05,AspiringNoodle,I ended up going with CSP because Photo chugged a little on my last build.
02-03-2021T00:27:26,unsteddyphoenix,Auto colour feature is here
02-03-2021T00:27:43,IronHorseComics,but Krita's animation was actually pretty easy to figure out
02-03-2021T00:28:07,AspiringNoodle,"NGL, if Tom switches over to Affinity Photo and praises its name"
02-03-2021T00:28:11,AspiringNoodle,I'd buy it in a heartbeat :p
02-03-2021T00:28:15,ArkanaCat,So Tom what made you decide to change up the last three panels of the comic
02-03-2021T00:28:31,IronHorseComics,I should really be in bed right now
02-03-2021T00:29:18,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah Tom test dummy it for us
02-03-2021T00:29:34,Dadrobit,"Ark, it was to give Sythe more agency"
02-03-2021T00:29:34,BadFoMo,Do what?
02-03-2021T00:29:51,AspiringNoodle,Test Affinity Photo.  It's a photoshop competitor with a perpetual license
02-03-2021T00:30:08,AspiringNoodle,"Imagine, paying a one-time fee! The horror! :ptv-shock:"
02-03-2021T00:31:10,BadFoMo,Perpetual license for a software product?! ...I like the sound of that.
02-03-2021T00:31:35,AspiringNoodle,Permission to link?
02-03-2021T00:31:50,IronHorseComics,"here's a good news Tom, I just looked it up and you can import photoshop brushes into Affinity Photo"
02-03-2021T00:33:03,Dadrobit,"Fuck, someone just smashed my gate. BBL. Paperwork time..."
02-03-2021T00:33:06,BadFoMo,"@AspiringNoodle Describe what it it, and if it's SFW, you'r good to go."
02-03-2021T00:33:08,unsteddyphoenix,Sure if you like
02-03-2021T00:33:14,unsteddyphoenix,Oh noo good luck dad

02-03-2021T00:34:50,BadFoMo,Yo.

02-03-2021T00:53:50,Twokinds,These background kill me
02-03-2021T00:53:59,Kameloh,they look scary to do

02-03-2021T01:58:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"as it stands, it’s hard to read rn"
02-03-2021T01:58:33,w0lfmare,Seems so
02-03-2021T01:58:44,w0lfmare,I will have to carry on alone

02-03-2021T01:59:10,Dadrobit,"""Carry on my wayward soooon~~~"""
02-03-2021T01:59:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m getting close to hallucinating unconsciousness
02-03-2021T01:59:47,TheSexyBeast,"Go sleep Kiwi, don't fight it"
02-03-2021T01:59:48,Dadrobit,"Been there, done that, did not enjoy it."
02-03-2021T02:00:08,SpazztasticKiwi,well now I’m getting mixed messages
02-03-2021T02:00:51,Dadrobit,"Well, now that my excitement for the night is over and nothing could possibly go awry from here on, I'm gonna go nuke some ramen, brb!"
02-03-2021T02:01:17,BadFoMo,No! You just jixed it!
02-03-2021T02:01:33,w0lfmare,Yeah chill time :cw0lfmare-Paperembercool:

02-03-2021T02:03:26,Dadrobit,"Ohhh, I also have some crab flavored chips I gotta try."

02-03-2021T02:04:21,AspiringNoodle,Don't sleep for 15 hours~
02-03-2021T02:05:10,Dadrobit,Chips tried. Do not recommend. Tastes like celery dipped in paprika.
02-03-2021T02:05:52,TheSexyBeast,*imagining what crab flavored chips would taste like - crab or potatoes*
02-03-2021T02:06:18,TheSexyBeast,"Yikes, even worse!"

02-03-2021T02:07:19,Dadrobit,In case of any doubt
02-03-2021T02:07:24,TheSexyBeast,Nite Foxx
02-03-2021T02:07:28,Dadrobit,o/ Foxx
02-03-2021T02:07:41,unsteddyphoenix,damn shame
02-03-2021T02:08:30,TheSexyBeast,Utz generally makes awesome chips
02-03-2021T02:09:05,Dadrobit,Never had em before. Resident dropped em off on us earlier.
02-03-2021T02:09:17,TheSexyBeast,Old Bay seasoning on potato chips though
02-03-2021T02:10:23,Dadrobit,"Paprika is not my spice of choice to begin with, so it was an uphill battle from the start."
02-03-2021T02:10:45,AspiringNoodle,Love Utz...
02-03-2021T02:10:53,AspiringNoodle,"Why u fail me, Utz? ;-;"
02-03-2021T02:11:05,TheSexyBeast,That was Ed Grimley's spice of choice
02-03-2021T02:11:34,Dadrobit,That and $4.29 for a bag of chips is kinda nutty as well.
02-03-2021T02:11:50,TheSexyBeast,Old Bay works best on fish
02-03-2021T02:12:59,AspiringNoodle,Or fries
02-03-2021T02:13:16,TheSexyBeast,Fish and chips
02-03-2021T02:13:33,w0lfmare,Lemon pepper is so underrated
02-03-2021T02:13:44,Dadrobit,"I was gonna say, someone heard fish and chips and did not know exactly what that meant"
02-03-2021T02:13:48,TheSexyBeast,On steak
02-03-2021T02:13:54,Dadrobit,W0lf for sure
02-03-2021T02:14:51,AspiringNoodle,"Oh!  That reminds me, if you like hot wings, but don't care for spicier sauces, here's something to try"
02-03-2021T02:14:57,TheSexyBeast,Done and done
02-03-2021T02:15:09,AspiringNoodle,Boom Boom sauce + BBQ dry-rub
02-03-2021T02:15:28,TheSexyBeast,Intriguing
02-03-2021T02:15:38,AspiringNoodle,There's a sports bar where I live that I believe uses Middleswarth BBQ seasoning (the same as their chips)
02-03-2021T02:15:45,AspiringNoodle,I tried it out of curiosity and it's so good~
02-03-2021T02:16:27,Dadrobit,"Wing that aren't hot are the equivalent of ""Going on a camping adventure"" by sleeping in a luxury RV in front of your house"
02-03-2021T02:16:47,TheSexyBeast,Will note that for future reference noodle
02-03-2021T02:16:59,Dadrobit,But I don't judge. Much.
02-03-2021T02:17:11,w0lfmare,"oops there goes my internet, guess I'm done streaming for tonight XD"
02-03-2021T02:17:32,Dadrobit,"RIP, w0lf. You were the best of us!"
02-03-2021T02:17:40,TheSexyBeast,Thanks for the stream w0lf
02-03-2021T02:17:49,unsteddyphoenix,Oh no!

02-03-2021T02:18:11,TheSexyBeast,More violence than lewdness
02-03-2021T02:18:26,Dadrobit,Porque no los dos?
02-03-2021T02:18:43,AspiringNoodle,"Dadro, what's the hottest sauce you've eaten?"
02-03-2021T02:19:06,Dadrobit,Ghost pepper made in-house at a local wing bar.
02-03-2021T02:19:22,Dadrobit,It's absurd. I truly mean ridiculous.
02-03-2021T02:19:36,TheSexyBeast,Carolina Reaper?
02-03-2021T02:20:04,AspiringNoodle,Well then
02-03-2021T02:20:09,AspiringNoodle,"What's the hottest you eat on the regular, lol"
02-03-2021T02:20:19,AspiringNoodle,Or is it the ghost pepper sauce? :ptv-shock:
02-03-2021T02:20:19,Dadrobit,I bring some home with me whenever I go there and use it for cooking. A single drop from a pipette is enough to spice up a whole crockpot of chili.
02-03-2021T02:21:17,AspiringNoodle,Reminds me of this story my neighbor told me
02-03-2021T02:21:39,AspiringNoodle,He used to work at an office that had a guy who entered a chili cookoff every year
02-03-2021T02:21:54,AspiringNoodle,And he *always* took first place for the category he entered
02-03-2021T02:22:20,AspiringNoodle,His secret?  His chili used several ghost peppers to spice it up.
02-03-2021T02:22:35,Dadrobit,Regularly? Jalepenos. Habeneros from time to time.
02-03-2021T02:22:42,AspiringNoodle,Yeah... most people who ate any amount of that chili and weren't used to it would need to visit the bathroom.
02-03-2021T02:22:45,TheSexyBeast,"Cooks at the local Tex-Mex restaurant make a sauce that they enjoy during their shift, not the stuff they serve pating customers. Rrally good."
02-03-2021T02:22:46,AspiringNoodle,"In like 15 minutes, lmao"
02-03-2021T02:23:25,AspiringNoodle,"Jalapenos don't really do anything for me, anymore"
02-03-2021T02:23:41,Dadrobit,I enjoy their taste.
02-03-2021T02:23:45,AspiringNoodle,Same~
02-03-2021T02:23:48,AspiringNoodle,Tasty little buggers
02-03-2021T02:24:18,AspiringNoodle,I'm the weird one in my family.  I'm seemingly the only person who has a taste for spicy foods.
02-03-2021T02:24:26,TheSexyBeast,Roasted Adoboes are tasty
02-03-2021T02:24:40,Dadrobit,The ghost pepper hot sauce from my wing bar is not to be fucked with. I absolutely love it.
02-03-2021T02:25:00,AspiringNoodle,Local pizza joint has a hot sauce called Xtra Hot
02-03-2021T02:25:17,TheSexyBeast,?
02-03-2021T02:25:28,AspiringNoodle,To give you an idea of how hot it is
02-03-2021T02:25:36,TheSexyBeast,Hot sauce on pizza?
02-03-2021T02:25:44,AspiringNoodle,"Nope, they do wings~"
02-03-2021T02:25:53,AspiringNoodle,"You probably could get it on a pizza, though"
02-03-2021T02:26:03,AspiringNoodle,"So I ordered their ""Flame-Fired Fries"""
02-03-2021T02:26:12,Dadrobit,"I was gonna say, the only heat anyone should put on a pizza are those little red pepper flakes."
02-03-2021T02:26:27,AspiringNoodle,That normally comes coated in garlic butter and dusted with parmesan.  I asked them to replace that with Xtra Hot
02-03-2021T02:26:36,TheSexyBeast,^ that! ^
02-03-2021T02:26:51,AspiringNoodle,My mother had but a single fry
02-03-2021T02:26:59,AspiringNoodle,Her mouth proceeded to be on fire for the next half hour.
02-03-2021T02:27:33,TheSexyBeast,Milkshake time
02-03-2021T02:27:35,AspiringNoodle,I got about 1/3 of the way through my fries before I hit the wall and needed to start drinking a lot more than eating
02-03-2021T02:27:51,AspiringNoodle,Man were they spicy
02-03-2021T02:28:04,Dadrobit,Bread is my go to for heat reduction. The bread soaks up the oils super good.
02-03-2021T02:28:17,AspiringNoodle,I've had Quaker Steak's Atomic sauce
02-03-2021T02:28:46,AspiringNoodle,"I've had Tomato's Xtra Hot.  Another bar's Inferno, etc etc etc."
02-03-2021T02:29:01,TheSexyBeast,Bread works well
02-03-2021T02:29:09,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, this sauce is somewhere up there with those Ghost Pepper based sauces xD"
02-03-2021T02:30:26,TheSexyBeast,"Gonna call it a night, y'all take care"
02-03-2021T02:30:37,Dadrobit,o/ TSB
02-03-2021T02:33:03,AspiringNoodle,later
02-03-2021T02:33:39,Dadrobit,Should probably find something productive to do myself.

02-03-2021T12:17:09,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s come to me that anyone here that gets me on fb likely can’t friend me because it’s private
02-03-2021T12:19:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I think anyone can still send a message
02-03-2021T12:20:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t remember when I messed with that last
02-03-2021T12:20:28,Roughlandin,"Lol, I need to make a profile for Rough, I guess. I thought about freinding you on my real profile but figured you'd wonder why some rando was asking to friend you lol"

02-03-2021T12:21:45,SpazztasticKiwi,as long as you’d send a hey it be rough message you’d be accepted
02-03-2021T12:22:06,SpazztasticKiwi,but a rando name friending me would get ignored yea
