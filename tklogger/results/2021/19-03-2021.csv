19-03-2021T00:00:39,SpaceCadety,"I still wonder why, if Mary could look into Rose's mind, she didn't do the same to him.  Also him attempting to grab Rose and bolt as Mary suggested would probably get him toasted before he made it halfway to the gate."
19-03-2021T00:00:58,Dadrobit,Whatever he woulda come up with ultimately would absolutely have been better than her getting ambushed by the information from Rose.
19-03-2021T00:01:24,steelabjur,Especially since the future Master Spy seemed to have it out for him.
19-03-2021T00:02:25,SpaceCadety,Granted I wouldn't really expect anyone to be rational in her position.  At least not immediately after she learns this.
19-03-2021T00:03:07,Dadrobit,"And, I mean, the human excuse absolutely woulda been legit. As far as anyone at the time knew, it was IMPOSSIBLE for a human and Keidran to breed."
19-03-2021T00:03:53,steelabjur,"Has the situation between Euchre and Master Spy been explained in the comic? In Raine's backstory they seem to be at odds, but current day they seem to be on the same page?"
19-03-2021T00:04:00,KeefMcDerpface,\o Night all. :ptv-sleepy:
19-03-2021T00:04:09,Ordithus,night keef
19-03-2021T00:04:11,steelabjur,G'night Keef
19-03-2021T00:04:31,Dadrobit,o/ keef
19-03-2021T00:04:39,Ordithus,master spy is a mysterious fella
19-03-2021T00:04:57,Dadrobit,Everyone has their own agenda.
19-03-2021T00:05:39,steelabjur,True.
19-03-2021T00:05:42,BadFoMo,The only thing I could think of that could have saved Rose and kept Euchre's secret would be to /suddenly remember/ that he and his manservent have similar sounding names and that he alowd him to send letters to his family.
19-03-2021T00:05:56,BadFoMo,"""She must have thought that he would be here with me."""
19-03-2021T00:06:38,Dadrobit,"Spy and Euchre are especially interesting in their relationship. Euchre wants Trace to live without his memories. Spy seems Hellbent on keeping him free and moving, bit to what end?"
19-03-2021T00:06:42,SageSaga,need water- brb
19-03-2021T00:06:51,Dadrobit,But*
19-03-2021T00:07:02,Dadrobit,Hail Hydrate!
19-03-2021T00:07:35,SpaceCadety,At least Euchre and Sirius seem to be interested in fixing things.  Keeping him from going all genocidal again seems to be a pretty high priority for the both of them.
19-03-2021T00:08:30,steelabjur,"Keeps Trace out of their hair, if he remembers who he is or if Master Seer makes a puppet out of him, they may be in hot drek."
19-03-2021T00:09:21,Dadrobit,"I dunno, if Spy was just interested in keeping Trace down, then why not work with everyone else left in the old order?"
19-03-2021T00:09:40,Dadrobit,Or let him rot on the Basitin isles?
19-03-2021T00:09:45,SpaceCadety,Sounds like Trace's power is a requirement for the Templar's plans.  Keep him free and away from them basically throws those plans out the window.
19-03-2021T00:09:51,steelabjur,Especially if they're acting against Evil!Trace's wishes regarding the Towers/Keidran.
19-03-2021T00:10:57,Dadrobit,"Brb, work is happening"
19-03-2021T00:11:08,Ordithus,stay safe
19-03-2021T00:11:36,Ordithus,"it's dangerous to go alone, take this"
19-03-2021T00:11:37,Ordithus,:newspaper2:
19-03-2021T00:12:56,SpaceCadety,"I still wonder if someone might have taken the opportunity when Trace was out subtly mess with his head.  Point crazy in the direction they wanted, keep him from thinking about how his actions would be the last thing Saria wanted."
19-03-2021T00:13:16,steelabjur,"From what I can tell, Master Architect was working on Evil!Trace's plans, Masters Spy and Strategist against them, Master Seer is trying to become the next Grand Templar, and who knows with Master Mage (but I'm leaning toward ""not good"")"
19-03-2021T00:13:53,SpaceCadety,I'm leaning toward very bad.
19-03-2021T00:14:35,CrimsonHelsing,"I agree with the previous message, Cadet. That's why the master Spy makes me uneasy"
19-03-2021T00:14:37,steelabjur,@SpaceCadety I highly suspect the other Mask we've seen (not Neutral) has been manipulating Trace for a long time.
19-03-2021T00:15:00,CrimsonHelsing,"I feel like he's been manipulating Trace for something, and he knew what would happen"
19-03-2021T00:15:31,CrimsonHelsing,Cruel bastards...
19-03-2021T00:15:52,steelabjur,"Apropo of nothing, but Master Mage wears a very ""Mask-like"" mask..."
19-03-2021T00:16:03,CrimsonHelsing,"Innocent people that didn't have to die are now dead, and more that never got a chance to live because of them"
19-03-2021T00:16:22,CrimsonHelsing,Including Trace's child with Saria
19-03-2021T00:17:03,SpaceCadety,"Well there manipulation, and then there's ""Hey he's out cold and damaged from attempting dangerous necromancy, let's magically prevent certain ideas from occurring to him"""
19-03-2021T00:17:10,CrimsonHelsing,"And I agree, we still know nothing about the Master Mage, or which mask he is (most likely Chaos)"
19-03-2021T00:19:14,SpaceCadety,"I still really want to see Kei's face when he realizes A) Flora is pregnant, and B) Who did the job."
19-03-2021T00:19:30,CrimsonHelsing,Agreed
19-03-2021T00:19:52,steelabjur,I've considered the ESH that Trace saw might be some supernatural agent rather than Trace himself. Maybe something the Mask put into his mind to manipulate him toward its goal.
19-03-2021T00:20:11,SpaceCadety,really Picarto?  B ) has significant other uses than an emoji
19-03-2021T00:21:01,SpaceCadety,Maybe he's just as damaged as Natani is.
19-03-2021T00:22:32,SpaceCadety,I mean they're both literally talking to things that seem like fragments of themselves.
19-03-2021T00:23:50,SpaceCadety,"Shame about the language barrier issue, that'd be an interesting conversation."

19-03-2021T00:37:15,unsteddyphoenix,Any hints?
19-03-2021T00:37:46,SageSaga,not really-
19-03-2021T00:38:07,SageSaga,other than maybe the head is wrong
19-03-2021T00:38:12,SageSaga,or the shoulder-
19-03-2021T00:42:49,ZRO4825,"The sleeve on the shoulder makes it look off, I think, since it's loose and not where the shoulder itself would be?"

19-03-2021T00:48:48,MagicAtlas,"I think it may be her hair thats off.  right above her exposed shoulder, the locks of hair appear to be growing out from her neck"
19-03-2021T00:56:38,MagicAtlas,you have nice art <3
19-03-2021T00:57:05,SageSaga,i just realized I didnt say gnight to Tom =_=

19-03-2021T01:13:45,SageSaga,only you all are able to tell i chopped her head off and moved it
19-03-2021T01:14:06,Dadrobit,Savage
19-03-2021T01:14:26,ZRO4825,Sometimes it's just necessary. Some people's heads just ain't where they should be.
19-03-2021T01:15:14,SageSaga,man its so late and i havent even looked at the comic script for tonight since last week
19-03-2021T01:15:16,SageSaga,what am i doing-
19-03-2021T01:16:25,Dadrobit,Cranial transplant surgery evidently
19-03-2021T01:19:28,SageSaga,man- i wish i could draw all 3 of the last pages for this chapter in one week-
19-03-2021T01:20:46,ZRO4825,I mean. You COULD...but you'd probably hate yourself for a while for it. :P
19-03-2021T01:20:50,SageSaga,i wanna get to Monster Village and draw all the hot monster girls-
19-03-2021T01:21:14,SageSaga,i also wanna get to the cliff hanger ending-
19-03-2021T01:21:28,ZRO4825,:ptv-shock:
19-03-2021T01:22:26,SageSaga,and I ALSO wish i could draw backgrounds better because i wish i could make a cool cover drawing of the village but - i suck at drawing buildings and towns-
19-03-2021T01:23:14,ZRO4825,:c
19-03-2021T01:24:42,BadFoMo,Do you have a 3D modeling program like SketchUp?
19-03-2021T01:24:49,SageSaga,its mostly a cliffhanger for Mike and no one cares about Mike
19-03-2021T01:24:52,DedFarway,Lol Sage is still online
19-03-2021T01:25:08,SageSaga,of course i am- why wouldnt I be?
19-03-2021T01:25:09,DedFarway,Hi again
19-03-2021T01:25:17,SageSaga,and yes I do Fomo
19-03-2021T01:25:26,Dadrobit,This is pretty standard for Sage tbh
19-03-2021T01:26:28,BadFoMo,You could make the buildings there and just trace over a 'print screen' of that.
19-03-2021T01:27:12,SageSaga,but then i gotta make detailed 3D models which is just as hard if not harder- and then i gotta do compositing work-
19-03-2021T01:32:52,ZRO4825,I like Mike.
19-03-2021T01:32:58,ZRO4825,He shares my name. :3c
19-03-2021T01:36:21,SageSaga,Spacecaptain?
19-03-2021T01:36:48,ZRO4825,Yes. Obviously.
19-03-2021T01:38:05,SageSaga,"""Honey, it might be the drugs talking but- let's name our son something unique and weird!"" ""Spacecaptain?"" ""YES!"" *Writes Spacecaptain*"
19-03-2021T01:38:50,SageSaga,"Doctor - ""Oh- i see you picked hard mode for your childs school years-"""
19-03-2021T01:50:09,BadFoMo,My brain did it again. I took a quick look at Mike and part of his coller looked like his toung. Anyone else get that?
19-03-2021T01:51:36,SageSaga,no
19-03-2021T01:51:40,ZRO4825,lol
19-03-2021T01:52:04,BadFoMo,Odd one out again.
19-03-2021T02:07:14,Dadrobit,"Man, this burrito is way better than it has any right to be."
19-03-2021T02:07:43,Dadrobit,Beef and jalapeno. Has big ol honkin slices of jalepeno.
19-03-2021T02:09:23,Dadrobit,$0.89 and it's better than some I've paid like five bucks for.
19-03-2021T02:09:28,Dadrobit,Wth
19-03-2021T02:09:40,SageSaga,congrats Robit
19-03-2021T02:09:50,SageSaga,youve done what all men dream to do
19-03-2021T02:09:58,SageSaga,pay very little for something really delicious
19-03-2021T02:11:13,Dadrobit,"Like it's not THE BEST EVER and it was kinda on the smaller size, but heck, it was tasty for real."
19-03-2021T02:11:50,Dadrobit,Makes me miss going out to proper sit down Mexican cuisine.
19-03-2021T02:12:31,Dadrobit,There is a complimentary nachos and salsa sized hole in my heart.
19-03-2021T02:13:34,SageSaga,local sit in mexican restaurant serves too much food tbh
19-03-2021T02:14:04,SageSaga,the burrito is like half the size of my head- personally i dont think we should be eating things that big all at once-
19-03-2021T02:14:26,Dadrobit,You're supposed to doggie bag it for lunch the next day.
19-03-2021T02:14:48,SageSaga,i would rather just have half of it for half price-
19-03-2021T02:14:51,Dadrobit,It's like.... Expected.
19-03-2021T02:15:17,SageSaga,its a mistake- only some foods are even half as good reheated
19-03-2021T02:15:27,SageSaga,fresh is best
19-03-2021T02:16:06,Dadrobit,"You are entitled to your opinion, but mine is the exact opposite. I love me some cold next-day half eaten burritos."
19-03-2021T02:16:21,SageSaga,c-cold?!\
19-03-2021T02:16:51,Dadrobit,"Yeah, honestly most of the time I don't bother reheating it."

19-03-2021T14:17:49,CrRAR,picarto though probably just being chaoticly selective yeah

19-03-2021T14:40:25,Ordithus,"hope you can feel better, sage."
19-03-2021T14:40:26,Twokinds,discontinue being in pain
19-03-2021T14:40:27,Hogan,Especially the pain part
19-03-2021T14:40:44,Ordithus,:newspaper2::csagesaga-nynasmirk: stop hurting

19-03-2021T14:43:09,SageSaga,but you are ok with jumping on an imaginary squirrel and tears its head off with your teeth- in the middle of my stream for noooo reason other than to be creepy
19-03-2021T14:43:19,SageSaga,tearing*
19-03-2021T14:43:47,microbuss,naaah
19-03-2021T14:44:04,SageSaga,then dont do it
19-03-2021T14:44:10,microbuss,ok
19-03-2021T14:44:34,ZapiliDver,If somebody cook a squirrel with some seasonings - i'll eat it
19-03-2021T14:44:45,microbuss,lol I'll go for that
19-03-2021T14:45:33,SageSaga,of course you would- you were ok with eating one alive on stream
19-03-2021T14:45:56,ZapiliDver,"But without a brain. Rabies usually dies under high temperatures, but i don't wanna risk too much"
19-03-2021T14:45:57,microbuss,wellll I think of nomming as chewing on but nmot eating
19-03-2021T14:46:27,SageSaga,ah yes- chewing on a rodent- better?
19-03-2021T14:46:35,microbuss,lol no
19-03-2021T14:46:49,SageSaga,so stop making weird excuses!
19-03-2021T14:51:15,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
19-03-2021T14:51:46,Twokinds,"It's my mother's birthday. I wish I could give her something more meaningful, but anytime I ask..."
19-03-2021T14:51:52,Twokinds,"She just says ""give me money"" XD"
19-03-2021T14:52:04,SpazztasticKiwi,oo
19-03-2021T14:52:18,ZapiliDver,But it's a very usefull gift
19-03-2021T14:52:23,SpazztasticKiwi,she likes thrift shopping
19-03-2021T14:52:30,Ordithus,"lol, well happy bday to your mom!"
19-03-2021T14:52:39,Twokinds,She does indeed
19-03-2021T14:53:03,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe she’ll get something she likes with that birthday money
19-03-2021T14:53:13,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce: my bday is coming up soon
19-03-2021T14:53:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"tada, you got her something meaningful by proxy"
19-03-2021T14:53:21,SageSaga,my mother always just says i dont need to get her anything or just asks me to go out to eat with her and my father
19-03-2021T14:53:42,BadFoMo,Happy Birthdays all around?
19-03-2021T14:54:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"my mother: doesn’t like celebrating her birthday, doesn’t like makeup/jewelry/shopping"
19-03-2021T14:54:24,SpazztasticKiwi,also my mother: why didn’t you get me something
19-03-2021T14:57:38,SpazztasticKiwi,my best bet is getting something for her 4 pound babied dog
19-03-2021T15:01:50,Twokinds,I never know what the appropriate amount is to give her
19-03-2021T15:03:34,Twokinds,or anyone
19-03-2021T15:03:55,SpazztasticKiwi,i usually spend a collective $100 but I often get something for myself with the same order as hers & I may even add other birthday or holiday presents to the order to get ahead of the game
19-03-2021T15:04:54,SpazztasticKiwi,$50 can make for a good shopping trip but I rarely spend more than $10 personally
19-03-2021T15:07:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I can give all sorts of gift ideas provided i know some hobbies a person has
19-03-2021T15:09:09,CrRAR,thoughtful stuff maybe
19-03-2021T15:09:50,Twokinds,My mother's favorite hobby is shopping
19-03-2021T15:11:18,CrRAR,"all the possibilities, so many things to discover"
19-03-2021T15:12:41,CrRAR,the “I saw this and thought of you” gifts go far with moms
19-03-2021T15:12:58,CrRAR,like little spontaneous knick knack stuff
19-03-2021T15:13:02,SpazztasticKiwi,^bingo
19-03-2021T15:13:07,CrRAR,yes
19-03-2021T15:13:32,CrRAR,Like I found this little bunny once holding a daisy
19-03-2021T15:13:48,CrRAR,bought. it.
19-03-2021T15:13:51,SpazztasticKiwi,see a necklace that reminds you of her? “found this and thought of you”
19-03-2021T15:14:09,CrRAR,maybe if it’s a certain style
19-03-2021T15:14:51,SpazztasticKiwi,and I suggest necklace because I doubt you know her ring size or clothes sizes
19-03-2021T15:15:20,SageSaga,ive thought about what i can do to make my nephews think im a horrible person-
19-03-2021T15:15:47,CrRAR,swear at wildlife
19-03-2021T15:15:51,SageSaga,ive wondered what their reaction would be if they gave me a card for christmas or my birthday- and i made sure they saw me throw it in the trash
19-03-2021T15:16:20,CrRAR,“feh”
19-03-2021T15:16:24,Ordithus,"""it was going there eventually anyways"""
19-03-2021T15:16:28,CrRAR,*trashes it aggressively*
19-03-2021T15:16:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Just pull out a chrome zippo and burn it in front of them
19-03-2021T15:16:37,SageSaga,but then i feel this thing beating in my chest and cant bring myself to do it-
19-03-2021T15:16:55,Ordithus,lmao
19-03-2021T15:17:01,CrRAR,sages heart grew three sizes that day
19-03-2021T15:17:20,SageSaga,and died from an exploded heart?
19-03-2021T15:17:57,CrRAR,:coffin:
19-03-2021T15:18:34,Ordithus,remember to be cruel once per week to avoid exploding heart syndrome
19-03-2021T15:18:53,CrRAR,reasonable
19-03-2021T15:19:06,CrRAR,can’t be good ALL the time
19-03-2021T15:22:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"could ask a lady friend what she thinks she’d want, Tom"
19-03-2021T15:24:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"or if you really want to earn brownie points, offer to go shopping with her"
19-03-2021T15:26:01,SageSaga,what if she wants money to go out and buy trashy romance novels though? probably doesnt want her son going with her for that-
19-03-2021T15:26:10,Ordithus,Sage I like what you've done with your characters for their dnd session in that one other comic you make
19-03-2021T15:26:25,SageSaga,what did i do to them? O_O
19-03-2021T15:26:32,Ordithus,lol
19-03-2021T15:26:39,Ordithus,"outfits, appearance"
19-03-2021T15:26:57,Hogan,... then earn more brownie points by offering to wait outside the bookstore! XD
19-03-2021T15:26:57,SageSaga,i had to update Namis - that outfit was baaaad
19-03-2021T15:27:20,Twokinds,was it?
19-03-2021T15:29:03,SageSaga,yeah it was like a brown leather plain chest plate with no design or markings-
19-03-2021T15:29:33,Hogan,Sounds like 1st lv. generic equipment...
19-03-2021T15:29:45,Hogan,".... yep, current one is way better :-)"
19-03-2021T15:31:32,SageSaga,not only that but the old one for some reason formed to her body like a body suit-
19-03-2021T15:31:40,SageSaga,which leather armor cant do
19-03-2021T15:33:35,SpazztasticKiwi,no I wasn’t serious
19-03-2021T15:37:17,Ordithus,qwerty has unusual arms
19-03-2021T15:37:55,SageSaga,he has unusual sleeves for his more unusual arms
19-03-2021T15:38:35,SageSaga,he has cyborg arms that can extend- and his sleeves can extend to protect his arms
19-03-2021T15:38:51,SageSaga,hes an engineer
19-03-2021T15:39:14,Hogan,Engineers are a crafty lot...
19-03-2021T15:40:32,Ordithus,convenient for reaching the top shelf in the cupboard
19-03-2021T15:40:43,Ordithus,or when that wrench is juuuust out of reach
19-03-2021T15:45:15,Hogan,.. or when you need to scratch that unreachable spot on your back!
19-03-2021T15:56:04,CrRAR,:cw0lfmare-Smugfox:

19-03-2021T16:09:09,SageSaga,ive got 2 - one for my ultrawide that i comped together because well-
19-03-2021T16:09:22,SageSaga,few places have super ultra wide high res backgrounds
19-03-2021T16:09:33,SageSaga,which is sad-
19-03-2021T16:09:39,SageSaga,so i had to make one
19-03-2021T16:09:51,SageSaga,using cool art i found naturally- not my own
19-03-2021T16:10:20,SageSaga,and my tablet background is one of Mihari's old commissions that i really liked- even though its a litttttle lewdish
19-03-2021T16:10:21,SageSaga,XD
19-03-2021T16:11:29,SageSaga,lemme show ya the big one though-
19-03-2021T16:11:34,Hogan,"Okay, now you have me curious! XD"

19-03-2021T16:12:02,Ordithus,I can't judge haha
19-03-2021T16:12:46,SageSaga,and then BAM! Random Werewolf because i liked the art-
19-03-2021T16:13:04,Hogan,"Oh, wow! Nice splicing of the images! :o"
19-03-2021T16:13:09,Ordithus,:eyes: nice!
19-03-2021T16:13:21,Hogan,Its like they were meant to be together
19-03-2021T16:13:52,Ordithus,that's some solid art
19-03-2021T16:14:03,SageSaga,this red head though was what i found when searching for Clerics of Sune-
19-03-2021T16:14:15,CrRAR,quite the menagerie
19-03-2021T16:14:18,SageSaga,and i absolutely love it
19-03-2021T16:14:31,Hogan,She fits the bill nicely :-)

19-03-2021T16:14:38,SageSaga,i tracked down the artist- and hes only drawn her one other time
19-03-2021T16:14:58,SageSaga,far as i can tell at least-
19-03-2021T16:15:06,SageSaga,let me see if i can find it- it was cute-
19-03-2021T16:15:12,CrRAR,ok
19-03-2021T16:15:23,Hogan,"Yes, please!"

19-03-2021T16:17:32,Ordithus,haha that is fantastic
19-03-2021T16:18:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Big wolf bro
19-03-2021T16:18:44,SageSaga,im pretty sure the fairy in the middleish was by Cutesexyrobutts?
19-03-2021T16:18:52,SageSaga,if thats how their name is spelled- i think it is
19-03-2021T16:19:39,AspiringNoodle,*flops exhausted into chat*
19-03-2021T16:19:49,AspiringNoodle,Trying to keep tabs of 3 streams is nigh impossible @_@

19-03-2021T16:20:00,Hogan,Hey Noodle!
19-03-2021T16:20:23,AspiringNoodle,Noodle about to have stromboli
19-03-2021T16:20:25,AspiringNoodle,And wiiiiiiiiiiiiiings
19-03-2021T16:20:40,CrRAR,yummm
19-03-2021T16:20:41,AspiringNoodle,I had to spice down because family is full of wimps :ptv-snicker:
19-03-2021T16:20:47,CrRAR,saucy wings?
19-03-2021T16:20:51,AspiringNoodle,Mild xD
19-03-2021T16:20:58,CrRAR,crunchyyy wings?
19-03-2021T16:21:11,AspiringNoodle,"I normally get the hot, but they do nothing for me.  But apparently they still let my family feel the burn."
19-03-2021T16:21:23,CrRAR,ah
19-03-2021T16:21:30,AspiringNoodle,Makes me thing about those Xtra Hot fries I ordered from a local pizza joint.
19-03-2021T16:21:41,AspiringNoodle,A SINGLE fry had my mother's mouth burning for 30 minutes
19-03-2021T16:22:10,AspiringNoodle,I got about 1/3 of the way through the box before the burn started getting uncomfortable.
19-03-2021T16:22:34,CrRAR,yeah just some don't associate spice with food
19-03-2021T16:22:34,SageSaga,people who arent bothered at all by spicy food- are broken people
19-03-2021T16:22:58,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:
19-03-2021T16:23:32,AspiringNoodle,^ Seconded
19-03-2021T16:23:53,SageSaga,it's true- think about it- its a chemical designed to keep things from eating it - but if you eat it and it doesnt affect you at all- if you cant taste the heat- you must be broken :P
19-03-2021T16:23:59,AspiringNoodle,"I'm not broken, I've just eaten too much and now I'm above the standards for ""spicy"" ;-;"
19-03-2021T16:24:10,Ordithus,it has broken you
19-03-2021T16:24:14,AspiringNoodle,"Which reminds me, remember that ""ghost pepper"" craze a few years back?"
19-03-2021T16:24:27,SageSaga,yep- you are broken now Noodle- a shell of your former self
19-03-2021T16:24:30,AspiringNoodle,Where every franchise and their mother was putting out some ghost pepper something or other?
19-03-2021T16:25:04,Twokinds,"It's true, I miss when jalapenos had that kick I loved."
19-03-2021T16:25:20,AspiringNoodle,We share the same pain...
19-03-2021T16:25:45,Ordithus,could lay off the spice for a while until you regain some sensitivity to it again
19-03-2021T16:25:56,Ordithus,rather than seeking even greater and greater spice
19-03-2021T16:26:08,AspiringNoodle,Not sure that's entirely possible.
19-03-2021T16:26:33,AspiringNoodle,I've gone for years without eating super spicy foods.
19-03-2021T16:26:56,AspiringNoodle,"But my tolerance is still at a point where what most places define as ""spicy"" is a mere buzz-tingle to me."
19-03-2021T16:27:16,Ordithus,you went so far to get permanent damage :cw0lfmare-VivianPanic:
19-03-2021T16:27:50,AspiringNoodle,Man... I wish Quaker Steak was still open...
19-03-2021T16:28:12,AspiringNoodle,"They have a ""Buckeye BBQ"" sauce.  It's as spicy as a raw jalapeno.  Tasted so gooooood"
19-03-2021T16:28:32,SageSaga,did Quaker Steak go under?
19-03-2021T16:28:38,SageSaga,the local one here shut down-
19-03-2021T16:28:48,SageSaga,it was my favorite wing place too T_T
19-03-2021T16:28:51,AspiringNoodle,"I think the chain as a whole is still healthy, but 1.5 - 2 years back, the only one in the area shut down"
19-03-2021T16:29:00,AspiringNoodle,"Which SUCKED, because I loved their Arizona Ranch :c"
19-03-2021T16:30:21,SageSaga,"T_T their wings were so good- someone told me ""Just get buffalo wild wings!"" and i was like ""Why would i shovel trash out of a dumpster to eat?"""
19-03-2021T16:30:52,Ordithus,haha
19-03-2021T16:30:56,Ordithus,it's sad because it is true
19-03-2021T16:31:28,AspiringNoodle,I've gone to BWW a few times.
19-03-2021T16:31:59,AspiringNoodle,"The first time was a solid meh, didn't see the appeal compared to one of my local sports bars that I've been going to since before it was bought out"
19-03-2021T16:32:30,AspiringNoodle,"But for now, it gets a solid pass because it's the only other sports bar in the area that does a great garlic parmesan wing sauce"
19-03-2021T16:33:10,AspiringNoodle,Most places: Garlic Parmesan = butter + shaved parmesan + garlic
19-03-2021T16:39:38,SageSaga,brb im ordering some bbq sauce from quaker steaks website XD
19-03-2021T16:41:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Tis the season for BBQ

19-03-2021T16:47:13,SageSaga,i wanted to buy some a few months back but the online store was out
19-03-2021T16:47:33,SageSaga,i just checked it and its back in stock - so im getting that delicious bbq saaaauce
19-03-2021T16:47:42,AspiringNoodle,Which one? :P
19-03-2021T16:47:45,CrRAR,the sauce must flow
19-03-2021T16:47:48,AspiringNoodle,Buckeye? :ptv-ohmy:
19-03-2021T16:48:33,SageSaga,REGULAR
19-03-2021T16:48:52,SageSaga,with that hint of cinnamon
19-03-2021T16:49:40,Ordithus,what I really really want is for someone to go as nuts with drumsticks as places go for wings
19-03-2021T16:50:03,SageSaga,no can do- drumsticks suck
19-03-2021T16:50:11,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-flomad:
19-03-2021T16:50:24,Ordithus,heresy
19-03-2021T16:51:05,SageSaga,drum sticks are too big to properly cook like wings
19-03-2021T16:51:18,AspiringNoodle,^
19-03-2021T16:51:31,AspiringNoodle,Fried foods work best with smaller items
19-03-2021T16:51:59,Ordithus,I've had some pretty dang good fried drumsticks
19-03-2021T16:53:28,SageSaga,are you talking about actual drum sticks or wing pieces drummies?
19-03-2021T16:53:52,Ordithus,actual drumsticks. the dark meat. the delicious meat
19-03-2021T16:54:49,CrRAR,:ccrrar-stek:
19-03-2021T16:55:04,CrRAR,drumettes are a thing though
19-03-2021T16:55:11,CrRAR,mini drums
19-03-2021T16:55:18,SageSaga,mega chickens or normal chickens?
19-03-2021T16:55:39,CrRAR,"i dunno, pygmy chicken apparently"
19-03-2021T16:55:51,SageSaga,talking to Ord
19-03-2021T16:55:56,CrRAR,ok
19-03-2021T16:56:12,CrRAR,Chickasaurus
19-03-2021T16:56:13,Ordithus,normal chickens
19-03-2021T16:56:25,Ordithus,though turkey drumsticks are pretty tasty in their own right
19-03-2021T16:56:32,CrRAR,yeah
19-03-2021T16:56:33,SageSaga,its hard to get normal chickens in the US
19-03-2021T16:56:46,Ordithus,we are getting far away from an optimal sauce to volume ratio
19-03-2021T16:56:51,SageSaga,we mostly have mutant big chested chickens
19-03-2021T16:57:10,CrRAR,yeah
19-03-2021T16:57:30,SageSaga,but- if you can get a normal sized chicken- you can make some amazing chicken thighs and drumstricks
19-03-2021T16:57:43,SageSaga,but on the mega chickens they are just too darn big and dry out too much
19-03-2021T16:57:48,Ordithus,yeah
19-03-2021T16:58:57,Ordithus,the fat in the dark meat does help keep it juicier
19-03-2021T17:00:36,SpazztasticKiwi,1 hour
19-03-2021T17:00:39,CrRAR,turkey very indulgent

19-03-2021T18:41:00,SpazztasticKiwi,pokemon cake lady
19-03-2021T18:41:46,SpazztasticKiwi,she had an order a week ago for a full sheet cake that she badgered is to tweak despite her knowing the copyright spiel & the rules
19-03-2021T18:42:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"well, she got her way a little and the design was tweaked, plus she got some cupcakes & 2 large slider trays - a total of over $100 of food"
19-03-2021T18:42:41,SpazztasticKiwi,she never comes to pick it up
19-03-2021T18:43:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"but we got a call - she had a car accident so completely understandable, the order is rescheduled to be remade & she just has to pay for the new order coming due this week"
19-03-2021T18:44:13,SpazztasticKiwi,she called yesterday to change her order again to cancel the trays
19-03-2021T18:44:33,SpazztasticKiwi,and then this morning again to change the cake...and the design....again
19-03-2021T18:47:25,SpazztasticKiwi,were confused and the cake decorator’s either ready to scream or cry
19-03-2021T18:50:29,AspiringNoodle,*sigh*
19-03-2021T18:50:44,AspiringNoodle,"And this is why more businesses just need to say ""no"" -_-"
19-03-2021T18:51:50,BadFoMo,"For **** sake, Pokemon Cake Woman! Get your **** together!"
19-03-2021T18:52:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"I know she has kids to please and it’s for them, but we can’t make it unless you tell us for sure what you want before you need it"
19-03-2021T18:55:07,AspiringNoodle,"Also, given kids can 180 their decisions literally minutes apart, at some point you just need to determine what to do :p"
19-03-2021T18:55:22,AspiringNoodle,"Be the adult and say, ""This is what will happen"" xD"
19-03-2021T19:03:47,CrRAR,they should have kits like spin art where kids can make their own birthday disaster cake decorations
19-03-2021T19:03:57,CrRAR,like a build-a-bear
19-03-2021T19:04:10,CrRAR,or a plaster fun time type place

19-03-2021T20:04:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not sure the kids care

19-03-2021T20:11:31,SpazztasticKiwi,oh she special
19-03-2021T20:11:37,CrRAR,hehehe
19-03-2021T20:13:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don’t doubt that she’s likely overwhelmed too - there’s never been one man with her regularly, either several at once or different ones at separate times so it’s anyone’s guess that they’re all hers and she’s raising them alone"

19-03-2021T20:14:01,CrRAR,aww
19-03-2021T20:14:23,SpazztasticKiwi,but the nonstop mind changing & bartering for special treatment is grating
19-03-2021T20:14:57,CrRAR,"yeah, she’s probably not helping the child’s attitudes by the example she leads"
19-03-2021T20:15:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"you may want something extra special for your kid(s) birthday and to give them anything they want, but we can only do so much for you"
19-03-2021T20:15:41,CrRAR,showing that you always get your way by yelling and brashness makes kids yell-y and brash
19-03-2021T20:15:56,CrRAR,yeah
19-03-2021T20:16:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"with as many as there are and the clear slack of discipline, I have no doubt they don’t respect her"
19-03-2021T20:17:03,CrRAR,well it’s more likely she’s the queen bee
19-03-2021T20:17:17,CrRAR,disapline probably went out the window long ago though
19-03-2021T20:17:54,CrRAR,*discipline
19-03-2021T20:18:11,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe they just want her attention constantly
19-03-2021T20:22:09,AspiringNoodle,"Imo, part of the problem with modern consumer culture is that customers have this mentality that companies will bend over backwards to fulfill their whims"
19-03-2021T20:22:24,CrRAR,yeah
19-03-2021T20:22:28,CrRAR,sometimes it’s lack of proper engagement with kids that causes that
19-03-2021T20:22:42,AspiringNoodle,"And a huge part of this problem is that customers have the highest expectations for the employees, but the employees and workers are not allowed to have expectations for customers"
19-03-2021T20:23:08,CrRAR,like that’s why there’s that trend of communicating with kids like adults
19-03-2021T20:23:26,AspiringNoodle,Could you imagine how much nicer things would be if businesses were allowed to refuse business to any customers not treating them with respect?
19-03-2021T20:23:31,CrRAR,making them understand the rules of cost of things and society
19-03-2021T20:24:03,CrRAR,"cuz if you don’t, they just become materialistic vortexes like noodle is saying"
19-03-2021T20:24:22,CrRAR,cuz they never truly gain a normal sense of ‘self’
19-03-2021T20:25:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"when in public, control your crotch fruit"
19-03-2021T20:25:09,CrRAR,"just that they ‘want’ things not knowing the work required, patience, or dollar mount"

19-03-2021T20:27:51,AspiringNoodle,Lady comes in and wants to know how much a certain pack of cigarettes are.  Gets irritated that we don't know and we don't have a sign up.
19-03-2021T20:28:29,AspiringNoodle,"Several problems.  If you looked at our wall of cigarettes, there's probably 50+ choices alones, ignoring kings / 100's"
19-03-2021T20:29:15,AspiringNoodle,"Some have both sizes side by side, some take up 3+ slots for 1 size, others are available in only 1 size and 1 slot.  Combine the advertisements we need to display, there's no way to display all the prices in a way that's legible."
19-03-2021T20:29:35,CrRAR,nope
19-03-2021T20:29:41,AspiringNoodle,"Also, in our area smokes are *expensive*.  Cheapest is ~$6.  Priciest $10.25+"
19-03-2021T20:30:04,AspiringNoodle,"Smoking is an expensive habit anyways.  You get hooked on the stuff, prepare to shell out huge chunks of your paycheck..."
19-03-2021T20:30:08,CrRAR,it is weird though how some do have giant posters displayed at some places
19-03-2021T20:30:20,CrRAR,mostly the ‘popular’ brands I guess
19-03-2021T20:30:33,AspiringNoodle,Other problem customer was a guy who was complaining for the sake of complaining
19-03-2021T20:30:41,CrRAR,I would thing the big names have rep to push promotional material
19-03-2021T20:30:45,CrRAR,think
19-03-2021T20:31:02,AspiringNoodle,He wanted to know how long alcohol lasts once opened or something like that
19-03-2021T20:31:19,CrRAR,long time most of it
19-03-2021T20:31:27,SpazztasticKiwi,“do I look like google”
19-03-2021T20:31:30,AspiringNoodle,"Hindsight is 20/20, and all that.  Now I wouldn't be willing to put up with that."
19-03-2021T20:31:45,AspiringNoodle,"But yeah, he was giving us a hard time because we don't know, ""This is your job, you should really know that."""
19-03-2021T20:32:12,AspiringNoodle,"Best smartass response I can think of right now would be, ""Okay, if you want me to be intimately detailed on everything in our store, I need to make more than $9.50 an hour, first."""
19-03-2021T20:33:22,AspiringNoodle,Because his demands basically treat us like we're highly paid specialiests who *aren't* making entry-level dead-end wages
19-03-2021T20:33:38,SpazztasticKiwi,in my experience it doesn’t matter if there’s clear signage
19-03-2021T20:33:48,SpazztasticKiwi,customers can’t read
19-03-2021T20:33:59,CrRAR,I could expect someone expecting someone at a liquor-specific store to know that
19-03-2021T20:34:07,AspiringNoodle,^
19-03-2021T20:34:18,AspiringNoodle,"iirc, a liquor store near my house starts at $13 an hour."
19-03-2021T20:34:25,CrRAR,yeah
19-03-2021T20:34:31,AspiringNoodle,"So basically, WAY less responsibility than a gas station attendant"
19-03-2021T20:34:45,AspiringNoodle,"AND a more specialized stock as opposed to, ""Fit all the things in any available space"""
19-03-2021T20:35:13,CrRAR,"best response: “dunno, it’s never around long enough for me to know!”"
19-03-2021T20:35:22,CrRAR,customer: “bwahahahaha”
19-03-2021T20:35:30,CrRAR,"“totally, dude”"
19-03-2021T20:35:36,CrRAR,*leaves*
19-03-2021T20:35:37,SpazztasticKiwi,and even if you read information out to someone or answer their question you’re still susceptible to being asked the very same question
19-03-2021T20:36:44,CrRAR,"sometimes it’s just like, idle question asking"
19-03-2021T20:37:26,SpazztasticKiwi,“so how much is this chicken?”
19-03-2021T20:37:32,SpazztasticKiwi,“$5.98/lb”
19-03-2021T20:37:44,SpazztasticKiwi,“so how much would a pound be?”
19-03-2021T20:37:56,CrRAR,m a t h
19-03-2021T20:38:06,AspiringNoodle,"""$5.98"""
19-03-2021T20:38:21,AspiringNoodle,"""And how many pounds will $5.98 get me?"""
19-03-2021T20:38:23,AspiringNoodle,"""1"""
19-03-2021T20:38:54,SpazztasticKiwi,“sorry we just closed for the day”
19-03-2021T20:38:59,CrRAR,maybe they are confused what “per” means xD
19-03-2021T20:39:05,SpazztasticKiwi,“so when will you open?”
19-03-2021T20:39:10,SpazztasticKiwi,“tomorrow?”
19-03-2021T20:39:22,AspiringNoodle,"""Never again.  Today was the final day of business. Goodbye forever."""
19-03-2021T20:39:53,SpazztasticKiwi,“...at 9 (am)” I added this because I thought maybe she meant the time
19-03-2021T20:40:56,CrRAR,"yeap, gotta draw the line"
19-03-2021T20:41:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"for awhile now we’ve been getting this couple - sometimes the man, sometimes the woman and who knows maybe they’re not together"
19-03-2021T20:42:30,SpazztasticKiwi,but they’re calling or coming by to order a full pick 3 bucket of just hot wings
19-03-2021T20:43:03,SpazztasticKiwi,we’ve told them multiple times each we can’t do that and it’s always “I’vE gOt It BeForE”
19-03-2021T20:43:21,CrRAR,oh no
19-03-2021T20:43:35,SpazztasticKiwi,eventhough we’ve explained ~multiple times~ that is no longer allowed
19-03-2021T20:44:03,SpazztasticKiwi,no longer allowed = cannot do ANYMORE = could’ve and did so in the past but no more
19-03-2021T20:44:48,CrRAR,is it just that it needs to be assorted hot pieces?
19-03-2021T20:45:10,SpazztasticKiwi,but like when the pokemon cake lady came by the deli every day for a month trying to catch a worker that didn’t know who she was (we were all informed of what she was doing/wanted)
19-03-2021T20:45:39,SpazztasticKiwi,to try to get them to take her modified copyright pokemon cake design order
19-03-2021T20:46:09,CrRAR,yeah cuz they find the one person that’s not familiar and suddenly *person* gets their wish
19-03-2021T20:46:20,CrRAR,everyone else: “nooooooooo!”
19-03-2021T20:46:54,SpazztasticKiwi,", all of us have been telling said couple the same thing: has to be at least two meats, we can no longer do just one meat for a bucket...period"
19-03-2021T20:47:43,SpazztasticKiwi,the guy got huffy one day and walked off but came back the next day & tried again and yet still got told the same
19-03-2021T20:47:57,SpazztasticKiwi,that time he got a bucket anyway tho
19-03-2021T20:48:21,CrRAR,"jeez, yeah, how many days you hold out for tasty chicken"
19-03-2021T20:49:12,CrRAR,worst case scenario: saucy chicken
19-03-2021T20:49:18,CrRAR,either way
19-03-2021T20:49:32,SpazztasticKiwi,they’re trying to find someone who’ll do it anyway or doesn’t know or doesn’t care
19-03-2021T20:50:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"hot wings are $5.98/lb, a pick 3 bucket is ~$13 or ~$15"
19-03-2021T20:50:18,CrRAR,*team member fulfills forbidden order*
19-03-2021T20:50:22,CrRAR,*team stalks closer to oblivious employee with whiffle ball bats*
19-03-2021T20:50:56,CrRAR,"“wha- wh- guys? no, GUYS! guyyyyysss”"
19-03-2021T20:51:10,CrRAR,*thwonkthwonkthwonk*
19-03-2021T20:51:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"~$13, you get 1-2 meats (one pound per meat so ex., one pound of bbq and one pound of chicken tenders) plus one pound of any vegetable except the macaroni, corn, or mashed potatoes"
19-03-2021T20:52:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"~$15, you get 3 pounds of meat, whether it be 3 different meats or 2 different meats"
19-03-2021T20:52:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"at $5.98/lb, 3 pounds is well over the ~$15 normally so they were getting it in the bucket"
19-03-2021T20:53:20,CrRAR,"wait, you can buy hot wings separately by the pound?"
19-03-2021T20:53:29,SpazztasticKiwi,...yeah
19-03-2021T20:53:45,CrRAR,and they specifically want the bucket for 3 POUNDS of chicken!?
19-03-2021T20:54:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"it’s however much you want of whatever you want, everything in the hot case goes by weight"
19-03-2021T20:54:07,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, they were trying to save money"
19-03-2021T20:54:11,AspiringNoodle,Which is why the rules changed
19-03-2021T20:54:12,CrRAR,"well, maybe if they’re having a party, or many ravenous kids"
19-03-2021T20:54:21,CrRAR,gottcha
19-03-2021T20:54:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"the only difference is the flat rate stuff like the 8, 16, 32, 50 & 100 piece chicken boxes, lunch  plates, & pick 3 buckets"
19-03-2021T20:55:39,CrRAR,"ah, yeah, like you have the by lb option RIGHT THERE. gotta follow the rules"
19-03-2021T20:56:31,CrRAR,"3 bucks more, but :violin:"
19-03-2021T20:56:38,CrRAR,very sad
19-03-2021T20:56:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"if you get just 3 pounds of one wing, it defeats the purpose of getting a bucket"
19-03-2021T20:56:57,SpazztasticKiwi,the buckets purpose is to be a variety
19-03-2021T20:57:07,CrRAR,yeah makes sense
19-03-2021T20:59:35,CrRAR,that many wings in a bucket just seems unnatural anyway
19-03-2021T21:00:12,CrRAR,“no one bucket should hold that many wings”
19-03-2021T21:15:00,AspiringNoodle,"Sorry if I'm a bit late, playing Apex xD"
19-03-2021T21:15:03,AspiringNoodle,"Long matches, little downtime"
19-03-2021T21:15:41,AspiringNoodle,To put the variety spin in a different light.  You get buckets cheaper because you help clear out multiple pieces of stock :p
19-03-2021T21:18:44,CrRAR,yeap
19-03-2021T21:19:43,CrRAR,"yeah, just one type esp wings with their popularity leaves lots of other stuff sitting around"
19-03-2021T21:20:46,CrRAR,wings be... flying... off the shelves
