05-01-2021T21:15:10,CrRAR,"well, he grew up human in a place that's pretty thickheaded on race relations but on a farm with Flora, but upholding laws in Edinmire essentially that was under Trace and now Braun's rule now essentially"

05-01-2021T21:18:44,CrRAR,He obviously allows Adira's tavern to operate
05-01-2021T21:19:27,Dadrobit,"Personal headcanon is that it was pressure from the guard academy that pushed him away from Flora, and seeing Euchre be the one to help her escape entrenched his feelings against canines."
05-01-2021T21:19:35,Dadrobit,Pure headcanon though
05-01-2021T21:19:57,CrRAR,sounds logical
05-01-2021T21:20:24,Dadrobit,"Like the other guards wouldn't be able to trust him if he chose to be with a keidran over the humans, so they made him choose or somesuch."
05-01-2021T21:20:45,CrRAR,I think it's important that he has a more unique perspective that Keidran are MORE than just animals.
05-01-2021T21:21:17,CrRAR,"and maybe like you say, even though they aren't that means they can be dangerous... like humans."

05-01-2021T21:23:48,Dadrobit,The other guards' reactions when Keiran was being kind to Flora makes me think that he might just be putting up a front (At least for the feline Keidran) for the rest of the guards.
05-01-2021T21:23:59,CrRAR,aka have to be treated equally in accordance to the law.
05-01-2021T21:24:43,CrRAR,"yeah Flora to him would be personal, she's family."
05-01-2021T21:24:51,Dadrobit,"Also, I mean, from the way Flora was talking about Trace ""Don't hurt him"" could easily lead Keiran to think that Trace was a dangerous and would need to be apprehended while Flora was being freed."
05-01-2021T21:25:36,CrRAR,but see that indicates he knows to value their lives as equal to humans secretly. that there's good and bad in every race.
05-01-2021T21:26:14,CrRAR,well Keiran would probably be upset someone like former Trace would harm Flora

05-01-2021T21:27:00,Dadrobit,That was before he knew it was Trace. He was upset that *Anyone would harm Flora.

05-01-2021T23:23:22,CrRAR,then the one jerk with them goes around being bitey
05-01-2021T23:23:29,CrRAR,wtf
05-01-2021T23:23:38,CrRAR,chill
05-01-2021T23:27:17,SpazztasticKiwi,ok a refresher reveals a splint is required 1-3 weeks after reduction at the hospital
05-01-2021T23:27:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"dude had his on for, again, ~24 hours"
05-01-2021T23:27:48,SpazztasticKiwi,my money is on it popping out again
05-01-2021T23:28:44,CrRAR,"""once you pop, the fun don't stop"" >:"
05-01-2021T23:29:32,CrRAR,he was just tired of wearing it already?
05-01-2021T23:29:50,SpazztasticKiwi,he said he couldn‚Äôt sleep with it on
05-01-2021T23:30:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt know if that means physically or comfort wise but I imagine you also can‚Äôt bathe with one on either
05-01-2021T23:30:57,SpazztasticKiwi,& he‚Äôd obviously shaved recently too but I don‚Äôt believe that requires a bath
05-01-2021T23:31:19,Ordithus,shaving can be done one handed
05-01-2021T23:31:49,SpazztasticKiwi,it was his.....right shoulder (if I have my orientations right) & he‚Äôs right handed
05-01-2021T23:32:28,CrRAR,"ah, tough"
05-01-2021T23:32:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean obviously he‚Äôs gonna do whatever he wants or likes and he‚Äôs grown so whatever
05-01-2021T23:33:23,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs like when I told him the obvious that he should stop drinking
05-01-2021T23:35:15,CrRAR,when it's distructive it's not good
05-01-2021T23:35:44,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah but I‚Äôm not his mother & I don‚Äôt live with him
05-01-2021T23:36:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve got the ‚ÄúI know‚Äù response - not much else I can do
05-01-2021T23:36:36,CrRAR,"eh, sometimes it's a battle not worth fighting"
05-01-2021T23:36:57,CrRAR,"noble, but sometimes a fool's errand"
05-01-2021T23:37:48,Ordithus,"change has to come from within, you can only push so hard"
05-01-2021T23:37:54,Ordithus,before he'd just push you away
05-01-2021T23:38:02,CrRAR,"yup, many do learn!"
05-01-2021T23:38:31,Ordithus,"doesn't mean give up, though"
05-01-2021T23:38:51,CrRAR,"just got to grow out of it, realize what's important"
05-01-2021T23:42:15,CrRAR,"""whether you think you can, or think you can't... you're right"""
05-01-2021T23:42:44,CrRAR,"""I... can drink!?"""
05-01-2021T23:42:53,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-keifacepalm:
05-01-2021T23:44:55,CrRAR,"""last time you wrecked the house, flipped the trailer, and the car ended up in a ditch"""
05-01-2021T23:45:02,CrRAR,"""so no"""
05-01-2021T23:47:00,SpazztasticKiwi,do you know what I‚Äôm talking about when I bring up the bridge scene in the last of us
05-01-2021T23:47:30,CrRAR,Sounds like a sentimental moment
05-01-2021T23:47:43,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs not
05-01-2021T23:47:49,CrRAR,ah
05-01-2021T23:48:00,CrRAR,I'll have to look it up
05-01-2021T23:48:30,SpazztasticKiwi,characters are on their way to the hospital across town & the only way to get there in time for the supplies to save another characters life is to go OVER the city
05-01-2021T23:49:09,SpazztasticKiwi,on man made ‚Äúbridges‚Äù put together with wood planks on skyscraper support beams
05-01-2021T23:49:17,CrRAR,ohhh
05-01-2021T23:49:22,SpazztasticKiwi,can I get a hell nah
05-01-2021T23:49:53,SpazztasticKiwi,there is no limit to how much no that idea is to me
05-01-2021T23:50:05,CrRAR,yeah jimmyrigged rope bridges from hell sound bad
05-01-2021T23:50:43,CrRAR,plus an occasional zombie!
05-01-2021T23:50:47,SpazztasticKiwi,what ropes? you think there‚Äôs ropes?
05-01-2021T23:51:06,CrRAR,"just planks, eh?"
05-01-2021T23:51:39,CrRAR,"Pirate in the group, ""I guess ye walk the plank"""
05-01-2021T23:51:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"planks of wood across metal beams, & the mess in your pants"
05-01-2021T23:51:48,CrRAR,*pushes him off*
05-01-2021T23:52:20,CrRAR,sounds absolutely serene
05-01-2021T23:52:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I have trouble with step stools over 2 feet
05-01-2021T23:52:50,SpazztasticKiwi,character would probably just have to die if they don‚Äôt send somebody else
05-01-2021T23:53:13,CrRAR,"heights don't bother me, but yeah rickety things in high places yes."
05-01-2021T23:53:49,CrRAR,ladders take a bit of faith
05-01-2021T23:54:23,CrRAR,"were there any outstretched ladders making up these ""bridges""?"
05-01-2021T23:54:37,SpazztasticKiwi,not so far
05-01-2021T23:54:40,CrRAR,that would be the worst
05-01-2021T23:57:06,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs Se√°n‚Äôs play through I‚Äôm watching & he doesn‚Äôt do heights either
05-01-2021T23:57:50,SpazztasticKiwi,he has been on the glass skyscraper elevator thing in the uk & a farris wheel
05-01-2021T23:58:20,SpazztasticKiwi,but he didn‚Äôt go near the glass or look too much out the windows
05-01-2021T23:59:33,CrRAR,yeah a glass floor something would be freaky
