24-02-2021T11:59:04,CrRAR,I'd imagine even just the extra electricity use lately puts strain on old circuits.

24-02-2021T23:42:24,AspiringNoodle,I *was* going to just take 20% of any money I got deposited into my account and move it to a savings account specifically for taxes
24-02-2021T23:43:05,AspiringNoodle,"But what I didn't realize is that when you work for someone else, at least half of your Social Security / Medicare taxes are covered by your employer."
24-02-2021T23:43:30,AspiringNoodle,"Generally called the ""Self Employment Tax"", 15.3% of your income will be taxed for that."
24-02-2021T23:44:10,AspiringNoodle,That said... the standard mileage deduction alone is reducing how much of my money is taxable by a rather huge margin
24-02-2021T23:44:58,CrRAR,woot
24-02-2021T23:45:48,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah... hard lesson learned on my first day, haha."
24-02-2021T23:46:21,AspiringNoodle,"First, as tempting as it is to start driving after finishing a delivery to move back towards restaurants, try sitting for a few minutes, you'll probably get an order if you're near them anyways."
24-02-2021T23:46:46,AspiringNoodle,"And considering most restaurants are 5+ miles away from where I live, I don't want to do really short shifts."
24-02-2021T23:47:35,AspiringNoodle,"First day, made $21, but thanks to the 29.62 miles I drove, I have a potential $16.58 tax reduction."
24-02-2021T23:48:45,AspiringNoodle,"Obviously I'll need to work much longer shifts to see what kind of taxable income I have, but that doesn't seem that great."
24-02-2021T23:49:11,AspiringNoodle,"Who knows, maybe I'll work a year and it turns out it's not that great of a gig for me"
24-02-2021T23:50:41,CrRAR,"yeah, it's a change of pace at least"
24-02-2021T23:50:54,CrRAR,"get to manage your own self, sorta"
