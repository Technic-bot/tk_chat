18-01-2021T00:06:48,Roughlandin,Why do I feel like those double Embers are shaking their heads at us?
18-01-2021T00:06:55,Sclimshady,They are
18-01-2021T00:06:57,TheSexyBeast,So what's the question about pants?
18-01-2021T00:07:07,Roughlandin,Wear them
18-01-2021T00:07:10,Roughlandin,No question
18-01-2021T00:07:40,Dadrobit,Comic got kinda weird in that last page. Sil and Viv were talking/arguing in such a manner that it almost read like they knew each other? Intended? Do they secretly know each other?
18-01-2021T00:07:55,Roughlandin,S e c r e t s?
18-01-2021T00:08:30,TheSexyBeast,"My misunderstanding then, apologies."
18-01-2021T00:08:57,Roughlandin,You must have this many pants to enter w0lf's chat: (1)
18-01-2021T00:09:00,w0lfmare,"Vivian Somewhat knows Sil. She's talked with Bernin about her earlier in the arc, and she's watched them practice, like when she was first introduced"
18-01-2021T00:10:23,Dadrobit,Mmmmm. Just the way they instantly pivoted the conversation to boyfriend talk was weird feeling. Cute. But weird.
18-01-2021T00:10:40,Ordithus,Viv went straight for the throat
18-01-2021T00:11:04,Dadrobit,And Sil instantly took the bait.
18-01-2021T00:11:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Sil Vs Viv who is best girl?
18-01-2021T00:11:26,w0lfmare,Vivian's got some pent up jealousy

18-01-2021T00:37:36,w0lfmare,"Yeah, I can't wait to get to Vaili's custom gear"
18-01-2021T00:38:00,Dadrobit,"Back when I was getting a degree in game design, nothing beat the feeling of seeing actual, tangible gameplay come together where once it was just an idea."
18-01-2021T00:38:44,w0lfmare,"I've made games before, but they were always just for me. It's really cool to try and polish and playtest something like this"

18-01-2021T00:42:42,w0lfmare,Playing healer in WoW is mostly what inspired me to make this game
18-01-2021T00:43:10,w0lfmare,Healers were never really my thing before
18-01-2021T00:43:49,SpaceCadety,former Druid with a Paladin alt. (and they both usually got roped into healing)  You?
18-01-2021T00:44:30,Ordithus,For the brief time I played I had a priest for the main
18-01-2021T00:45:03,w0lfmare,"Holy priest, then restoration druid"

18-01-2021T00:47:01,SpaceCadety,Don't think I ever took him into raid content though.
18-01-2021T00:47:06,w0lfmare,"I started off in DPS, but playing as a healer, you feel so useful"
18-01-2021T00:47:23,w0lfmare,Felt more skill based too
18-01-2021T00:47:34,w0lfmare,Very fulfilling gameplay
18-01-2021T00:48:28,Dadrobit,Playing as a support gets lower queue times as well.

18-01-2021T00:49:09,w0lfmare,"Yeah, in any game"
18-01-2021T00:49:11,SpaceCadety,"Yeah, was nice, being the one that kept everyone alive, and occasionally saved everyone with a well timed/placed tranquility cast"
18-01-2021T00:49:14,Dadrobit,I take pride in enabling it.
18-01-2021T00:49:58,Ordithus,"I didn't get to the end game stuff, but leveling up and doing instances it was very easy to get into groups"
18-01-2021T00:50:04,w0lfmare,"I also watched the anime Goblin Slayer, and I knew I wanted a priest character"
18-01-2021T00:50:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Isn't that show lewd in like a horror way?
18-01-2021T00:50:40,Dadrobit,"Ohh, I missed that anime. I remember it made the rounds being super popular/divisive for  a bit there."
18-01-2021T00:50:57,w0lfmare,"Yeah a lot of stuff was oof, but I like horror, and it was a really creative show"
18-01-2021T00:51:30,Sclimshady,"Lewd in a horror way,  what does that even mean?"
18-01-2021T00:51:39,SpaceCadety,less fun when you have to chase an idiot tank with a bastard DPS/tank build that could drain a raid geared resto druid of mana.
18-01-2021T00:51:52,Dadrobit,Sclim has never seen Bible Black
18-01-2021T00:51:58,Sclimshady,I have not
18-01-2021T00:52:06,Dadrobit,Save yourself
18-01-2021T00:52:19,Dadrobit,Urutsokidoji As well.
18-01-2021T00:52:35,SpaceCadety,"and this was in late WotLK era, where healers going OOM was just not a thing that happened."
18-01-2021T00:52:38,Dadrobit,"(forgive my spelling there, I think it was something like that)"
18-01-2021T00:54:15,Sclimshady,Not forgiven
18-01-2021T00:54:25,Dadrobit,I tried
18-01-2021T00:55:33,w0lfmare,Are there any other games where the healer takes the center stage?
18-01-2021T00:55:41,w0lfmare,Surely there must be
18-01-2021T00:56:17,w0lfmare,Wait
18-01-2021T00:56:26,w0lfmare,Surgeon simulators!
18-01-2021T00:56:28,Dadrobit,Plenty of esports
18-01-2021T00:57:16,w0lfmare,I mean more in the game itself
18-01-2021T00:57:38,Dadrobit,"Old flash game. ""5 days to live"" or something like that."
18-01-2021T00:57:41,w0lfmare,Not as a member of a multiplayer party
18-01-2021T00:58:25,Dadrobit,You play as a doctor/researcher looking to cure a deadly virus wiping out the planet.
18-01-2021T00:59:07,AspiringNoodle,"Hmmm, one second"
18-01-2021T00:59:14,w0lfmare,"Huh, interesting"
18-01-2021T00:59:19,Dadrobit,"One of the first games that did ""permanent"" choices matter kinda thing where just resetting the game doesn't undo anything."
18-01-2021T00:59:34,Dadrobit,Like undertale before undertale.
18-01-2021T01:00:03,SpazztasticKiwi,12 oclock & owls well 🦉
18-01-2021T01:00:13,Dadrobit,"Very simple quick game, but I remember it had a pretty solid impact on the indie scene at the time."
18-01-2021T01:00:39,Ordithus,"well work tomorrow, I should sleep"
18-01-2021T01:00:51,Ordithus,"Night! Thanks for the stream, take care~"
18-01-2021T01:00:58,Dadrobit,o/ Ord
18-01-2021T01:01:01,w0lfmare,I should call it here too
18-01-2021T01:01:10,w0lfmare,Before it gets too late to eat
18-01-2021T01:01:13,Dadrobit,"Found it, it was called ""One Chance"""
18-01-2021T01:01:16,Sclimshady,"Night w0lf,  thanks for the stream!"
18-01-2021T01:01:29,w0lfmare,Thanks for watching!
18-01-2021T01:01:38,Dadrobit,Thanks for the stream!
18-01-2021T01:01:39,w0lfmare,One chance?
18-01-2021T01:01:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Thanks for stramy
18-01-2021T01:01:49,Maku,thanks for streaming w0f!
18-01-2021T01:01:54,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it was the name of the flash game. 2010."
18-01-2021T01:02:13,AspiringNoodle,"I... can't think of any games where a ""healer"" takes center stage ;-;"
18-01-2021T01:03:04,w0lfmare,"Well good, I'll be the first one to do it like this!"
18-01-2021T01:03:09,Dadrobit,"You're a scientist working on a miracle cure, that turns into a hyper deadly virus and must spend the last 6 days of humanity choosing how to spend your time."
18-01-2021T01:03:44,w0lfmare,"Honestly this game is going to be so weird and different, gameplay/genre wise. I just hope it's not too weird in a bad way XD"
18-01-2021T01:03:48,AspiringNoodle,"yeah, now that I think about it, Trauma Center is the only game where a ""healer"" takes the main role"
18-01-2021T01:04:01,AspiringNoodle,But it's a surgical simulator / visual novel?
18-01-2021T01:04:13,w0lfmare,Yeah
18-01-2021T01:04:34,w0lfmare,That's the best example I can think of that has healing as the gameplay at least
18-01-2021T01:04:42,AspiringNoodle,"Lol, now that I think about it, Cursed Mountain is somewhat in that vein xD"
18-01-2021T01:04:46,Dadrobit,"Phone game ""Extreme Job Knights Assistant"" kinda does it."
18-01-2021T01:04:48,AspiringNoodle,"You aren't ""killing"" ghosts"
18-01-2021T01:05:01,AspiringNoodle,You're exorcising them or cleansing their spirit
18-01-2021T01:05:20,Dadrobit,You have to follow a knight as he traverses a dungeon picking up his loot and keeping him alive.
18-01-2021T01:05:22,AspiringNoodle,The game is heavily influenced by Buddhism

18-01-2021T01:06:08,AspiringNoodle,Game you imagine it?
18-01-2021T01:06:12,AspiringNoodle,Violent buddhist monk ghosts?
18-01-2021T01:06:16,AspiringNoodle,How does that work?!
18-01-2021T01:06:56,Dadrobit,"Makes total sense. Buddhist believe that reincarnation happens after death. If they're ghosts, then it didn't go well for them."
18-01-2021T01:07:28,AspiringNoodle,"...oh, right"
18-01-2021T01:08:00,AspiringNoodle,"After all, the game is ""protagonist's brother pissed off the goddess of the mountain, and now demons and angry ghosts are running amok"""
18-01-2021T01:08:20,w0lfmare,Oh dear
18-01-2021T01:09:27,SpazztasticKiwi,boo Tom 👻
18-01-2021T01:09:51,Dadrobit,"Brb, gonna go nuke some spicy miso ramen."
18-01-2021T01:11:10,w0lfmare,Nice!
18-01-2021T01:11:36,w0lfmare,I need to hunt down some food too. Probably a wild pizza
18-01-2021T01:11:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I call those the gimme feets
18-01-2021T01:12:52,SpazztasticKiwi,on the subject of food...I have doughnuts & muffins
18-01-2021T01:13:33,w0lfmare,I haven't had a doughnut in so long:cw0lfmare-PaperemberClose:
18-01-2021T01:13:59,SpazztasticKiwi,o no
18-01-2021T01:14:09,SpazztasticKiwi,how have you survived
18-01-2021T01:15:09,Dadrobit,"Man, a bagel really does sound good though."
18-01-2021T01:15:33,Dadrobit,One of the ones with cheddar and jalepenos on top.
18-01-2021T01:15:49,Dadrobit,Alas my ramen will suffice.
18-01-2021T01:19:27,w0lfmare,Never had a bagel like that before
18-01-2021T01:20:08,w0lfmare,Anything with cheddar and jalapenos on it is automatically good
18-01-2021T01:20:36,Dadrobit,"They're supremely tasty. Cut it open, toast it, and pop some deli meats in the middle to make a sandwich out of it. Absolutely divine"
18-01-2021T01:35:49,DarthRexKing,bye bye. :V
18-01-2021T01:46:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m off tomorrow so there’s no reason to go to bed early
18-01-2021T01:46:56,SpazztasticKiwi,yet I’m so warm n comfy
18-01-2021T01:50:05,Twokinds,ow headache
18-01-2021T01:53:41,SpazztasticKiwi,allergies getting you today?
18-01-2021T01:55:15,Twokinds,I think it's a change in diet.
18-01-2021T01:55:29,Twokinds,Trying to eat better.
18-01-2021T01:56:08,SpazztasticKiwi,ooo
18-01-2021T01:56:16,SpazztasticKiwi,caffeine withdrawal maybe?
18-01-2021T01:56:31,SpazztasticKiwi,or is it more sugar that you’re cutting?
18-01-2021T01:59:13,Twokinds,Not sure.
18-01-2021T01:59:27,Twokinds,I've heard any signifigent chance can cause headaches.
18-01-2021T01:59:37,Twokinds,Dunno what specifically might be the cause.
18-01-2021T01:59:45,Twokinds,change*
18-01-2021T02:02:58,SpazztasticKiwi,or stress
18-01-2021T02:04:42,SpazztasticKiwi,is eating healthier gonna be your goal this year - I figured you already did pretty ok on your diet
18-01-2021T02:07:18,Dadrobit,I can 100% attest to Caffeine withdrawals inducing migraines. I cut caffeine cold turkey January 1st. From 2 Monsters and coffee every day to nothing.
18-01-2021T02:07:59,Dadrobit,I'm only in the past few days starting to feel okay.
18-01-2021T02:08:19,SpazztasticKiwi,did you manage to sweep all the pieces of your skull together when it exploded
18-01-2021T02:09:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a twisted relationship with headaches
18-01-2021T02:09:34,Dadrobit,"No joke, I was out on the porch with my parents and my mom almost had half a mind to call an ambulance because I was a shaking jittery mess early on."
18-01-2021T02:09:56,SpazztasticKiwi,is it my recent caffeine habits? am I just not feeling well? is it mother nature telling me she’s going to knock on my door early?
18-01-2021T02:10:15,SpazztasticKiwi,is it my current diet? do I need to eat a banana or some spinach?
18-01-2021T02:10:41,SpazztasticKiwi,is Timmy stuck in the well?
18-01-2021T02:11:12,AspiringNoodle,Today I'm just about to start doing the same thing :|
18-01-2021T02:11:24,AspiringNoodle,I was downing about 4 - 5 16.9oz bottles of diet dew a day
18-01-2021T02:11:53,AspiringNoodle,Been kinda... hazy all day?
18-01-2021T02:20:30,SpazztasticKiwi,good talk Tom
18-01-2021T02:21:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m gonna get distracted for a little while then go off to bed when I can no longer be bothered to concentrate on whatever video I’m watching now

18-01-2021T12:41:42,CrimsonQuill,Ah well.
18-01-2021T12:43:56,CrimsonQuill,"So, has anything interesting happened for you today?"

18-01-2021T12:46:28,CrimsonQuill,"Would you, if possible, be able to make that minecraft world you had available? I want to explore it and check things out, and finish the Maze story, and just enjoy the scenery."

18-01-2021T12:48:05,CrimsonQuill,...Anyone here ever just make tea with the water used to boil their pasta/rice/potatoes?
18-01-2021T12:52:23,Xexanoth,why would you do that?
18-01-2021T12:52:46,CrimsonQuill,"Firstly, it actually tastes okay to me."
18-01-2021T12:53:03,CrimsonQuill,"Secondly, my house has lead piping, so I don't like to waste the water we filter if possible."
18-01-2021T12:53:17,CrimsonQuill,"And third...I do it because, well, why not?"
18-01-2021T12:53:58,CrimsonQuill,"That being said, this is the brain that put peanut butter and marmite on a hot-crossed-bun, and that wasn't so desirable in the end."
18-01-2021T12:55:55,CrimsonQuill,"...I have disgraced myself in the eyes of the culinarily minded, haven't I?"

18-01-2021T14:55:26,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, Tom, have you watched any of the films by Cartoon Saloon? Secret of Kells, Song of the Sea, Breadwinner, Wolfwalkers?"
18-01-2021T14:55:42,Twokinds,I haven't seen any of those
18-01-2021T14:55:45,CrimsonQuill,"(I've only seen Kells so far, but the trailers for the others give me goosebumps)"
18-01-2021T14:55:52,CrimsonQuill,"I highly, HIGHLY recommend them."
18-01-2021T14:56:01,CrimsonQuill,"If you possibly can, I would recommend you watch them."
18-01-2021T14:56:16,CrimsonQuill,Japan has Studio Ghibli. Ireland has Cartoon Saloon.
18-01-2021T14:56:33,CrimsonQuill,"I suggest you start with Kells, where it all began, if you ever have the time."
18-01-2021T14:57:17,CrimsonQuill,"Except for Breadwinner, which is set in Afghanistan, the films are part of an ""Irish Mythology Trilogy""...essentially, exploring and crafting stories from Irish myths and legends."
18-01-2021T14:58:23,CrimsonQuill,I'm hoping they'd be something nice you can enjoy. :D

18-01-2021T23:13:27,SpaceCadety,I don't understand the appeal of throwing so many LED's on your computer case that you have to consider them in buying your PSU.
18-01-2021T23:16:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I boop
18-01-2021T23:16:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera does not like the boop
18-01-2021T23:25:19,Dadrobit,Mine is a 100% sleeper PC. No windows or RGB at all.

18-01-2021T23:52:12,AspiringNoodle,My case has very limited RGB
18-01-2021T23:52:29,AspiringNoodle,"I might add more in the future, but I intend to have very tight control over the lighting"
18-01-2021T23:52:48,AspiringNoodle,"Be it a static color, or a very limited color range / specific effects"
18-01-2021T23:53:14,AspiringNoodle,"As it stands though, 4 sources of light, all doing the basic rainbow spectrum"
18-01-2021T23:53:22,AspiringNoodle,<- is lazy
