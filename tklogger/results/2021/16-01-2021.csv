16-01-2021T12:38:03,SpaceCadety,I think it's my backup drive.  Maybe.  It stopped and hasn't reoccurred.  Yet.
16-01-2021T13:12:39,CrRAR,"sometimes they work themselves into a fit, but it could be an early sign, sometimes it just becomes more and more frequent."
16-01-2021T13:22:06,CrRAR,clunking I think happens because what the drive software thinks is happening and what the drive parts are actually doing don‚Äôt quite match
16-01-2021T13:22:22,CrRAR,so it just sort of flails till it gets what it expects
16-01-2021T13:25:19,ZapiliDver,HI all.

16-01-2021T16:05:38,Xexanoth,"You should write yourself a ""How-to"" :ptv-laugh:"
16-01-2021T16:05:45,Twokinds,I did. I lost it.
16-01-2021T16:05:51,ProsePro7,HAHA
16-01-2021T16:05:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Make a how to video
16-01-2021T16:05:58,Twokinds,I don't remember where I saved it.
16-01-2021T16:06:09,ProsePro7,Ive done that at work many a time
16-01-2021T16:06:10,CrRAR,welp
16-01-2021T16:06:15,CrimsonQuill,Oh crumbs Tom...my sympathies!
16-01-2021T16:06:23,Roughlandin,I do the same thing all the time. Only it's in my brain
16-01-2021T16:06:52,Rainelover,Hallo everyone!

16-01-2021T16:08:57,CrimsonQuill,"Okay, so...something happened today in Minecraft."
16-01-2021T16:09:10,CrRAR,o yeah?
16-01-2021T16:09:10,Skornos,What happened?
16-01-2021T16:09:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,You dug to greedily?
16-01-2021T16:09:25,CrimsonQuill,"I had a harcore world I'd been working on...I'd build a round tower keep, and a small chapel on an island."
16-01-2021T16:09:35,CrimsonQuill,I had intended to fortify the small island into a village.
16-01-2021T16:09:50,Roughlandin,...Then everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked
16-01-2021T16:09:55,CrimsonQuill,"However...somehow...as I was going up the stairs in my tower, I saw a creeper right in front of me."
16-01-2021T16:10:04,CrimsonQuill,I was too flabbergasted to raise my shield.
16-01-2021T16:10:10,Skornos,Hardcore... I think I already know whay h
16-01-2021T16:10:15,Skornos,Haplened
16-01-2021T16:10:17,CrimsonQuill,So passed the island fort of Argryll....
16-01-2021T16:10:19,Roughlandin,"Tick, tick, boom"
16-01-2021T16:10:49,CrimsonQuill,It hurt a lot...I think it's the farthest I'd gone along in a hardcore so far.
16-01-2021T16:10:52,Skornos,That's why I never startbig projects in hardcore worlds...
16-01-2021T16:10:55,CrimsonQuill,"Still, I at least have Subnautica."
16-01-2021T16:11:04,CrimsonQuill,Christopher the Cyclops!
16-01-2021T16:11:10,Roughlandin,This is why you always place more torches than you think you need
16-01-2021T16:11:11,CrimsonQuill,Papyrus the Prawn Suit!
16-01-2021T16:11:19,CrimsonQuill,And Edinmire the Seamoth!
16-01-2021T16:11:40,Roughlandin,I need to get back into Subnautica. I like feeshes
16-01-2021T16:11:42,CrimsonQuill,@Roughlandin That's the thing! My house was brighter than Las Vegas Light pollution...it must have snuck in.
16-01-2021T16:11:47,NezumiYuki,"Haz you found sum Cuddles, Crimson?"
16-01-2021T16:11:52,LunarSchnitzel,I feel ya quill. Died in my 200hr world a couple weeks ago too
16-01-2021T16:12:05,ProsePro7,All I did in minecraft was finish a rail road
16-01-2021T16:12:36,Rainelover,Did anyone hear about the Virginia man that was caught with fake inauguration credentials and a handgun?
16-01-2021T16:12:37,CrimsonQuill,"@NezumiYuki I sure have! I have named him ""Little Kitten"" after the Custodes from 'If The Emperor Had A Text-To-Speech Device. He is ADORABLE."
16-01-2021T16:12:41,Roughlandin,I finally picked up Zelda BoTW the other day lol
16-01-2021T16:12:56,CrimsonQuill,Subnautica is terrifying...but rewarding.
16-01-2021T16:13:01,ProsePro7,Why the long wait Rough
16-01-2021T16:13:04,Roughlandin,@Rainelover That's a quick way to get on a federal watchlist for the rest of your life
16-01-2021T16:13:21,CrimsonQuill,"Got ganged up on seperately by both the Ghost Leviathans on the Eastern Blood Kelp Zone, by the Dunes."
16-01-2021T16:13:31,Roughlandin,@ProsePro7 Idk. I have so many games I've been meaning to pick up but never had
16-01-2021T16:13:32,CrimsonQuill,Almost got sliced and diced by a warper.
16-01-2021T16:13:44,Roughlandin,I finally beat Witcher 3 this year after starting it like 4 times
16-01-2021T16:14:15,CrimsonQuill,@Roughlandin I made a deal with my sister that if she plays Halo Reach MCC on Legendary I'll play Witcher 3 on Deathmarch.
16-01-2021T16:14:38,NezumiYuki,"Ya know... Not gonna lie but, I wish there were other small rocks... Just plain small rocks you could pick up with your Repul Gun and chuck at stuff with!"
16-01-2021T16:15:12,NezumiYuki,"Oh HAI warper, didn't see you there.. .Here... Have a ROCK!   CHUCK!!!"
16-01-2021T16:15:22,CrimsonQuill,Oh yeah
16-01-2021T16:15:32,CrimsonQuill,And I froze a Reaper in the Crash Zone and scanned 'im
16-01-2021T16:15:38,CrimsonQuill,He almost nommed me
16-01-2021T16:15:39,Roughlandin,I almost never play on the really hard difficulties. I get too frustrated. That's why I've never finished a Souls-like game
16-01-2021T16:15:45,NezumiYuki,Bahahaha nicely done Crimson!
16-01-2021T16:16:09,CrimsonQuill,"My favourite log is the guy who somehow scanned it without a propulsion gun, and then made the decoys."
16-01-2021T16:16:20,CrimsonQuill,"He's in a life-death situation, but..unflappable and stoic."
16-01-2021T16:16:48,CrimsonQuill,"""The journey's longer than the decoy lifetime but it should be enough to get me to the ship. If you don't find me on board, presume I miscalculated."""
16-01-2021T16:16:55,Roughlandin,I beat MCC Combat Evolved on legendary but I've only got through the first level of Halo 2
16-01-2021T16:16:56,CrimsonQuill,God rest that poor blighter...
16-01-2021T16:17:06,CrimsonQuill,@Roughlandin I've done all of them
16-01-2021T16:17:09,CrimsonQuill,ALL of them.
16-01-2021T16:17:19,CrimsonQuill,Halo CE Truth and Reconciliation broke my sanity.
16-01-2021T16:17:39,CrimsonQuill,Halo 2 'Regret' and 'The Great Journey' drove me insane.
16-01-2021T16:17:42,NezumiYuki,"Well clearly this fella ISN'T Tom's brother...   ""Uhhh what are YOUUUUUU! Me no likey you... Me talk in CAVE MAN SPEAK...""   at the sight of a GasO Pod"
16-01-2021T16:17:47,CrimsonQuill,Halo Reach was okay
16-01-2021T16:18:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Reach might be my fave out of all of them
16-01-2021T16:18:31,CrimsonQuill,"@NezumiYuki True that! XD ""That thing was huge! And ugly too!"" *Reaper Roar* ""And RIGHT BEHIND ME oh He is AH!"""
16-01-2021T16:18:43,Roughlandin,Getting into the ship on Truth and Reconciliation is probably the hardest part of the whole game
16-01-2021T16:18:43,CrimsonQuill,Halo 3 legendary was actually more annoying for me than 2...
16-01-2021T16:18:48,CrimsonQuill,Halo 3 ODST wasn't bad
16-01-2021T16:19:17,Roughlandin,The brutes on H2 are such bullet sponges on legendary
16-01-2021T16:19:20,CrimsonQuill,"And since I'd beaten Halo 4 legendary about 3 times or so when I'd first got it in 2017, it was a walk in the park...not to mention it's my favourite story"
16-01-2021T16:19:35,CrimsonQuill,@Roughlandin What about Regret's Boss fight? I was at that for an hour or more!
16-01-2021T16:20:07,NezumiYuki,"Out of all the deadly things in Subnautica to die from, I'm surprised Mark didn't get bit by any of the floaters he messed around with.  xDDD   Image the RAGE if Mark was on low health, messed around with a floater, trying to stick it to a rock to float i"
16-01-2021T16:20:18,NezumiYuki,"it out of the cave entrance, and it bit him?!"
16-01-2021T16:20:29,CrimsonQuill,For me...crashfish are just annoying.
16-01-2021T16:20:35,CrimsonQuill,In the early game they terrified me.
16-01-2021T16:20:40,CrimsonQuill,Now I just dislike them.
16-01-2021T16:20:42,NezumiYuki,Raararhalhrahrlararrrr BOOM!
16-01-2021T16:20:47,CrimsonQuill,"But the Reapers...Oh God, the Reapers!"
16-01-2021T16:21:04,CrimsonQuill,"I am no Jacksepticeye. I shan't mess with the ecosystem. But Darn it, they're terrifying!"
16-01-2021T16:21:04,NezumiYuki,reapers are our friends... They just want to give us hugs!
16-01-2021T16:21:08,NezumiYuki,with their mouths........
16-01-2021T16:21:19,Rainelover,"@Roughlandin If im not already on a watchlist with what i look up, i would be surprised, plus i think that they have better things to worry about than a random 18 year old looking up when hitler was born out of sheer boredom"
16-01-2021T16:21:25,ProsePro7,Speaking of Jack did anyone else hear him go off on the shippers?
16-01-2021T16:21:49,NezumiYuki,I would need to look that up later
16-01-2021T16:21:56,NezumiYuki,@ProsePro7
16-01-2021T16:22:17,CrimsonQuill,Go off on the shippers Prose? What do you mean?
16-01-2021T16:22:20,Roughlandin,You mean the Septiplier people?
16-01-2021T16:22:33,ProsePro7,Rough has the base of i
16-01-2021T16:22:35,ProsePro7,it
16-01-2021T16:22:39,Roughlandin,I would think that kinda died down once Amy came on the scene
16-01-2021T16:22:58,Roughlandin,(Either way Mark and Eef are way cuter together)
16-01-2021T16:23:26,ProsePro7,He essentially told everyone to stop doing NSFW art of him and Mark or his buddies like Corpse Husband saying it was creepy
16-01-2021T16:24:15,Roughlandin,Oh yeah that's pretty creepy
16-01-2021T16:24:49,Roughlandin,"Like, it's one thing to r34 fictional characters, but Sean and Mark are like... people"
16-01-2021T16:25:25,ProsePro7,They've been doing it for years but I think that he finally got sick of it I think he is even considering quitting YouTube
16-01-2021T16:25:40,ProsePro7,Some people have issues
16-01-2021T16:25:42,CrRAR,:ptv-nope:
16-01-2021T16:26:26,BadFoMo,Who's quitting YouTube?
16-01-2021T16:26:27,Roughlandin,Don't make lewd art of real people against their consent. Never go full Chris Chan.
16-01-2021T16:26:40,ProsePro7,Jack Scepticeye said he's thinking about it
16-01-2021T16:27:20,ProsePro7,There is always that section of a fan base that just goes too far
16-01-2021T16:27:24,BadFoMo,Like leaving or deleting his account?
16-01-2021T16:27:40,ProsePro7,I think leaving
16-01-2021T16:27:40,NezumiYuki,"Admittedly I'm way behind in whatever Jack or Mark is doing these days, but, I'll need to look that up to get a feel of Sean is serious about this retiring thing."
16-01-2021T16:28:05,ProsePro7,He has a video on it dont know which one though
16-01-2021T16:28:11,ProsePro7,He also tweeted it
16-01-2021T16:28:13,NezumiYuki,hmm
16-01-2021T16:28:20,Roughlandin,It was his 2020 update right?
16-01-2021T16:28:26,ProsePro7,Maybe?
16-01-2021T16:28:32,Roughlandin,I know he mentioned last year hit him really hard
16-01-2021T16:28:49,SpazztasticKiwi,from years ago unless something happened and I‚Äôve yet to see some recent stuff
16-01-2021T16:29:09,BadFoMo,"Ah. So if he does leave, he /could/ come back if he wanted too."
16-01-2021T16:29:26,Roughlandin,I heard he thought about quitting because last year was so tough. I haven't heard him say he's still thinking about it though
16-01-2021T16:29:36,BadFoMo,Deleting your account is just stupid in my eyes.
16-01-2021T16:29:48,SpazztasticKiwi,they both made a point about it years ago - Se√°n most heavily but they both have girlfriends
16-01-2021T16:30:10,ProsePro7,"He's made his money and unless you're Arin Hanson not many people want to die on camera, his words not mine"
16-01-2021T16:30:18,SpazztasticKiwi,it didn‚Äôt help Se√°n these past few years that he had changes in his relationships
16-01-2021T16:30:37,BlackjackSec99,o7
16-01-2021T16:30:42,BadFoMo,Yo?
16-01-2021T16:30:44,Roughlandin,Hey BJ
16-01-2021T16:30:45,BlackjackSec99,have we heard from Tom yet
16-01-2021T16:30:55,Roughlandin,Yep. He's compiling the votes
16-01-2021T16:30:55,ProsePro7,He should be coming back soon
16-01-2021T16:31:00,Roughlandin,Should be starting any minute
16-01-2021T16:31:03,BlackjackSec99,okie dokie ^.^
16-01-2021T16:31:09,ProsePro7,He said 4:30 but that he may need more time
16-01-2021T16:31:13,SpazztasticKiwi,that video is about how hard the year was for him but I haven‚Äôt had a chance to watch it with my full attention yet so he could very well mention septiplier again
16-01-2021T16:31:43,Roughlandin,People get too invested in the personal lives of their celebrity heroes
16-01-2021T16:32:01,Roughlandin,"Like, he's a real person. He has agency. Please respect it"
16-01-2021T16:32:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"Se√°n, Mark, & Ethan and even the first twos girlfriends  - ok all internet ‚Äúcelebrities‚Äù - have some frankly disgusting fans"
16-01-2021T16:32:14,ProsePro7,People with no life need to live through others I guess
16-01-2021T16:32:36,RheagarsArtEmporium,so we convene again friends of Tom
16-01-2021T16:32:46,SpazztasticKiwi,those three in fact have accounts on fb claiming to more or less be them
16-01-2021T16:32:54,ProsePro7,o/ Art
16-01-2021T16:33:02,Roughlandin,Everybody has disgusting fans. That's why there are still people supporting Ryan Haywood now that he's trying to restart on twitch
16-01-2021T16:33:06,BlackjackSec99,celebs of all kinds have crazy fans.  the only real variable is how MANY crazy fans each celeb has
16-01-2021T16:33:32,SpazztasticKiwi,something I can guarantee none of them know about but they‚Äôve each said in some form or another that‚Äôs a no no
16-01-2021T16:33:44,NezumiYuki,"We're not crazy fans, are we, Tom?  :P"
16-01-2021T16:33:51,BlackjackSec99,...mostly
16-01-2021T16:34:12,Roughlandin,Not as long as you keep feeding me spicy Mike pics
16-01-2021T16:34:14,Roughlandin,;p
16-01-2021T16:34:18,ProsePro7,Its nothing new Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs from Welcome Back Cotter had a stalker that chased him for years
16-01-2021T16:34:28,ProsePro7,And that was the 1970s
16-01-2021T16:34:51,Roughlandin,Have you guys seen Vivziepop's weird stalker guy?
16-01-2021T16:34:58,BlackjackSec99,??
16-01-2021T16:35:01,ProsePro7,That she made up or real?
16-01-2021T16:35:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Se√°n has mentioned he‚Äôs had hit butt grabbed before & Mark talked about a fan that touched his face
16-01-2021T16:35:20,RimaDraws,hi kiwi

16-01-2021T16:35:38,NezumiYuki,I'm more concerned about butt grabbing... Face touch... not as much tbh
16-01-2021T16:35:47,ZapiliDver,"Hi Kiwi, Blackjack"
16-01-2021T16:35:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"either one, somebody would be catching these hands"

16-01-2021T16:36:02,RimaDraws,right
16-01-2021T16:36:05,BlackjackSec99,"dunno... butt grab is kinda personal space, but face is like, intimate...."

16-01-2021T16:36:26,BlackjackSec99,Ho Zapili!

16-01-2021T16:36:42,Roughlandin,Never heard of Vivzie having a fake stalker. But yeah some dude made mulitple accounts pretending to be an animator and then stole other people's animation to try and get close to the Helluva Boss team
16-01-2021T16:36:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Marks been tackled before
16-01-2021T16:36:56,NezumiYuki,?  really Spazz?

16-01-2021T16:37:16,BlackjackSec99,the Vivzie thing
16-01-2021T16:37:19,RimaDraws,like girls who think his gf isnt worth
16-01-2021T16:37:23,RimaDraws,worthy*
16-01-2021T16:37:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt doubt that rima

16-01-2021T16:52:24,Combak,"@BlackjackSec99, so, close to the ""Nuke here to cause an earthquake"" spot?"

16-01-2021T16:54:44,CrimsonQuill,"If I may ask...Tom, given that you probably (I may be wrong) still have the original files, is there any chance that you might upscale some of the smaller and older sketches on Patreon, or will you leave them as they are?"
16-01-2021T16:54:56,Twokinds,i dunno
16-01-2021T16:54:57,ZapiliDver,"Damn, and on friday i'll get 0*C - ""We show you a trial winter, pay 100500$ for retail version"""
16-01-2021T16:55:20,Combak,It'd probably be a bit of work for not much reward Quill. You asking for any picture in particular?
16-01-2021T16:55:23,CrimsonQuill,'Cause they really are beautiful to look at. I could stare at the details for a long time.
16-01-2021T16:55:28,CrimsonQuill,@Combak Most of them...
16-01-2021T16:56:03,CrimsonQuill,It's also 'cause I have a 1440p monitor for college and leisure. Some pics are smaller on it
16-01-2021T16:56:18,BlackjackSec99,"that would likely be some serious work to re-create, and they would probably look different because art styles evolve over time"
16-01-2021T16:56:23,Roughlandin,I feel that. Got a 1440p monitor for Christmas. Everything is so smol
16-01-2021T16:56:24,CrimsonQuill,...Also I am a sucker for ultra-large backgrounds
16-01-2021T16:56:41,Combak,"Blackjack, he's just asking for a larger version of the original image"
16-01-2021T16:56:43,CrimsonQuill,"@BlackjackSec99 I meant an increase in size, not a redraw"
16-01-2021T16:56:47,NezumiYuki,LOL and here on my old 1280x1024 everything looks smol and normal.. well to me anyway...  xD

16-01-2021T17:08:59,abrachoo,didn't expect to see a no evil suggestion
16-01-2021T17:09:10,MoonDance,Chibi nibbly is just Nibbly with larger eyes

16-01-2021T17:10:31,MoonDance,Some were okay. But more good ones though
16-01-2021T17:10:31,Roughlandin,"The curse of being a popular patreon page, Tom"
16-01-2021T17:10:37,Twokinds,Honestly I go crosseyed trying to edit them all.
16-01-2021T17:10:37,Menke,Anything that's a reference to another property is going to be harder because people who don't know that thing won't usually vote for it
16-01-2021T17:10:44,Archataerra,The Top suggestions look awesome though
16-01-2021T17:11:04,Roughlandin,Somebody should really tell that one suggester that Chimera has a name lol
16-01-2021T17:11:12,NDR548,does she?
16-01-2021T17:11:16,CrimsonHelsing,Geez Tom xD poor guy
16-01-2021T17:11:16,ProsePro7,@Twokinds which is harder to edit Omni or the usual poll?
16-01-2021T17:11:18,Twokinds,"I try my best to format them all so they're presentable in a poll, but it's a lot to go through. A lot of typos and mispelled names. XD"
16-01-2021T17:11:27,Twokinds,It's the same thing.
16-01-2021T17:11:32,NezumiYuki,"Easy enough to understand, Tom, that's one hell of a list, let alone a Poll to write up!"
16-01-2021T17:11:43,CrimsonHelsing,Oh ikr Tom? The cringe xD
16-01-2021T17:11:44,Roughlandin,Cheers to Tom for all the hard work behind the scenes!

16-01-2021T17:11:59,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds How much work is it in a typical day for you to organize all of this?
16-01-2021T17:11:59,Twokinds,I feel like a teacher grading homework

16-01-2021T17:12:14,CrimsonQuill,I forgot about the no @ rule
16-01-2021T17:12:18,Twokinds,Well it depends. I try to contact people if there's issues with a suggestion
16-01-2021T17:12:20,MoonDance,"In grammer, what would be the class avereage"

16-01-2021T17:12:36,BlueStreak98,I'd say 48% at best
16-01-2021T17:12:50,CrimsonQuill,Jeepers...
16-01-2021T17:12:50,Twokinds,Sometimes people typo a name and I don't know who they're talking about.
16-01-2021T17:12:54,Menke,Just put '[sic]' after every suggestion.  Much easier!
16-01-2021T17:12:55,Roughlandin,"Not every suggestion can be ""Trace eating pretzels"""
16-01-2021T17:12:59,Twokinds,"Like, they give a character a completely different name XD"
16-01-2021T17:13:02,NezumiYuki,"Tell us Headmaster Fischbach, have we been good students?"
16-01-2021T17:13:07,BlueStreak98,Are those pretzels making him thirsty?
16-01-2021T17:13:19,TeapotOfDoom,you mean like very fixen clovis?
16-01-2021T17:13:19,NDR548,give the boy some water
16-01-2021T17:13:22,Twokinds,I can't tell if it's a typo or a character from a property I'm not familiar with.
16-01-2021T17:13:26,unsteddyphoenix,hope youre collecting all the natanimisspellings1

16-01-2021T17:15:57,Archataerra,I agree with SpaceCadety
16-01-2021T17:16:06,Twokinds,It was Excel

16-01-2021T23:20:11,ProsePro7,I still see Zen sitting in the back enjoying the show
16-01-2021T23:20:15,Roughlandin,"I know lol. I was joking, Ord"
16-01-2021T23:20:16,Twokinds,Natani stole the runes off something else originally.

16-01-2021T23:20:24,NezumiYuki,Oh I see!
16-01-2021T23:20:28,Twokinds,He didn't invent them.

16-01-2021T23:20:32,Roughlandin,Natani? STEALING things! *Gasp!*
16-01-2021T23:20:41,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rainehappy: so much lore drop tonight
16-01-2021T23:20:45,MuonNeutrino,do natani's bandages lead to the same pocket space as whatever device he stole the runes from? cause that could get awkward >.>

16-01-2021T23:21:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"so if someone was to be living in this pocket dimension floating in a sea of nothingness with her knives, they‚Äôd just occasionally see a hand appear and grab something?"
16-01-2021T23:21:08,SpazztasticKiwi,am I getting that right
16-01-2021T23:21:10,SpaceCadety,Now I'm curious to find out who Nat got them from.
16-01-2021T23:21:12,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,I love this so much
16-01-2021T23:21:14,Ordithus,they'd be a pincushion

16-01-2021T23:21:29,Twokinds,"It was probably a magic bag. And those ARE each unique. Since obviously, people don't want their stuff getting mixed up."
16-01-2021T23:21:31,CrimsonHelsing,"Poor Flora, someone get a medic over here xd"
16-01-2021T23:21:32,SpaceCadety,And do they have a pocket dimension that goes to the same place?

16-01-2021T23:21:51,MuonNeutrino,"well, given that natani uses that space to store his *chest*, not knives, anyone who found their way in there probably WOULD end up a pincushion cause nat would kill them XD"

16-01-2021T23:37:13,SpazztasticKiwi,oh I read a thing on reddit
16-01-2021T23:37:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"dads, what would you do if your son brought a ‚Äú‚Äùfriend‚Äù‚Äù home that he hung out repeatedly"
16-01-2021T23:38:59,Roughlandin,Uh. Depends on how old and whether they plan on staying the night
16-01-2021T23:39:00,FenceEqualizer,anyone else waiting in suspense?
16-01-2021T23:39:02,SpazztasticKiwi,this dad was asking reddit how to let his son know that he figured out that his sons ‚Äúfriend‚Äù was a little more than that
16-01-2021T23:39:06,RimaDraws,night guys! night tom and thanks for the stream
16-01-2021T23:39:09,RimaDraws,<3 <3

16-01-2021T23:39:43,TheSexyBeast,Nite Rima
16-01-2021T23:39:43,ProsePro7,Oh good to see Tom still lurking
16-01-2021T23:39:51,FenceEqualizer,I hope people gave him good advice and not the early 1970's type of advice.
16-01-2021T23:39:55,KeefMcDerpface,night Rima
16-01-2021T23:40:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"the son is 20, if that helps"
16-01-2021T23:40:26,Ordithus,that's kind of a mind your own business deal then
16-01-2021T23:40:47,Roughlandin,"Uh... Be careful. Keep it down, we have thin walls."
16-01-2021T23:41:13,TheSexyBeast,Just remind his son to be careful and use protection?
16-01-2021T23:41:19,KeefMcDerpface,Also depends if it's a 'guy' friend or a 'girl' friend.
16-01-2021T23:41:33,Roughlandin,I'm assuming guy.
16-01-2021T23:42:00,Roughlandin,At least he doesn't have to worry about grankids!
16-01-2021T23:42:16,TheSexyBeast,"Not anyone's business, just keep it down."
16-01-2021T23:42:37,SpazztasticKiwi,he‚Äôs basically asking how to let his son know he‚Äôs ok with him  having a male partner
16-01-2021T23:42:51,FenceEqualizer,Yo son. So I figure your friend is more then that...and I love you and support you. But if you're loud enough to wake the house i'm going to open the door and ask if you're winning son. And we both don't want that.
16-01-2021T23:42:58,SpazztasticKiwi,the boy is evidently keeping it secret
16-01-2021T23:43:25,FenceEqualizer,Aww that's kinda sweet.
16-01-2021T23:43:26,Roughlandin,Let him come to it on his own terms
16-01-2021T23:43:26,SpazztasticKiwi,possibly scared his dad won‚Äôt approve
16-01-2021T23:43:38,KeefMcDerpface,poor guy
16-01-2021T23:43:52,FenceEqualizer,Nah f that let supportive father support. Better his son not be afraid.
16-01-2021T23:44:29,Roughlandin,"Maybe start dropping hints in normal conversation like, ""Oh hey. X celebrity came out. That's pretty cool!"""
16-01-2021T23:45:12,TheSexyBeast,"""Son? It's okay, I'm not going to judge your decision."""
16-01-2021T23:45:23,Ordithus,BEAR HUG
16-01-2021T23:45:39,Roughlandin,Bear hugs are nice :ptv-hearts:
16-01-2021T23:46:00,TheSexyBeast,I see what you did there...
16-01-2021T23:46:54,Ordithus,bite the bullet and accept that it's likely to be embarrassing for someone no matter what
16-01-2021T23:47:37,Roughlandin,"Yeah, I get that. I still kinda feel like it's the son's decision on whether he wants to be out or not, though"
16-01-2021T23:47:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"one other user said her mom sent her a text ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have to admit anything to me that you‚Äôre not comfortable with or ready to, but I want to let you know that if jasmine is more than just your friend, I want to let her know she‚Äôs just as loved here...."
16-01-2021T23:47:50,SpazztasticKiwi,(in their home) too‚Äù
16-01-2021T23:47:53,Roughlandin,Outing someone who isn't ready can be pretty traumatic
16-01-2021T23:49:26,Roughlandin,"So... less ""we know you're gay."" and more, ""we know you're an adult who can make your own decisions and we support you."""
16-01-2021T23:49:31,SpazztasticKiwi,most of them suggest writing a letter for him to read alone later
16-01-2021T23:50:04,TheSexyBeast,What Rough said
16-01-2021T23:52:39,Roughlandin,We kinda knew about my brother for a long time before he came out senior year of high school
16-01-2021T23:52:58,TheSexyBeast,"...and my phone is down to 6%, so I am calling it a night. Thanks again for the stream, Tom."
16-01-2021T23:53:06,Roughlandin,"My parents always made it very clear that love was never wrong, though"
16-01-2021T23:53:10,Roughlandin,Night Beast!
16-01-2021T23:53:26,TheSexyBeast,Nite everyone! \o
16-01-2021T23:53:38,ProsePro7,Bye Beast
16-01-2021T23:55:01,KeefMcDerpface,night Beast
16-01-2021T23:55:36,FenceEqualizer,Have a goodnight beast
16-01-2021T23:57:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I thought taco bell had screwed me over for a second there
16-01-2021T23:58:10,ProsePro7,Not enough Diablo sauce?
16-01-2021T23:58:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt eat anything past mild
16-01-2021T23:58:53,ProsePro7,Where is the fun if your mouth isnt numb
16-01-2021T23:58:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I finished my food and nary a moment later got dangerously nauseous
16-01-2021T23:59:19,ProsePro7,...its Taco Bell isnt that expected
