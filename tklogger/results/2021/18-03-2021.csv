18-03-2021T17:08:09,Ordithus,it was a 10 year old mercury sable with 205k miles on it.
18-03-2021T17:08:18,CrRAR,maybe the semi didn't see it spazz
18-03-2021T17:08:29,SpazztasticKiwi,he hasn‚Äôt said anything about the wreak but I can imagine it‚Äôs not drivable anymore

18-03-2021T20:02:02,Ordithus,not to be confused with the necro dlc
18-03-2021T20:02:30,SageSaga,Nyna cant - but the type of magic she has can- Monster Magic is weird- regular magic can do it too but its usually more temporary transformations and high level
18-03-2021T20:02:51,CrRAR,oh sage I saw Penguin Highway
18-03-2021T20:03:02,CrRAR,"besides a total ""wut"""

18-03-2021T20:04:42,BadFoMo,What's the difference between Monster Magic and just Magic? Other than Mosters use it.
18-03-2021T20:05:36,SageSaga,Monsters mostly use sorcery while mages use magic
18-03-2021T20:05:44,CrRAR,"also spazz, Cardinal: Chicken Edition"
18-03-2021T20:05:48,CrRAR,:chicken:
18-03-2021T20:06:05,SageSaga,sorcery is an innate connection and use of magic while wizards use magic through study and learning
18-03-2021T20:06:59,CrRAR,"a most unfortunate recoloring, if hoping for camouflage"
18-03-2021T20:07:02,CrRAR,:ccrrar-chickcr:
18-03-2021T20:07:03,Rainelover,Hallo everyone!
18-03-2021T20:07:08,CrRAR,heyo Raine!
18-03-2021T20:07:09,BadFoMo,Yo.
18-03-2021T20:07:33,SageSaga,so sorcery is often a bit random - you can have one monster that just throws fire and lighting and another that cant seem to throw fire at all- yet can bend the will of humans or turn people into animals
18-03-2021T20:08:01,SageSaga,while wizards can do whatever they eventually learn how to do- with the more advanced stuff being much harder and complicated
18-03-2021T20:09:00,SageSaga,Nekomata magic is highly associated with body enhancement/modification and illusions - and can also have some offensive abilities- usually fire
18-03-2021T20:09:01,Ordithus,would there be certain monsters that use magic more like a wizard?
18-03-2021T20:09:03,ZapiliDver,Hi all!

18-03-2021T20:35:52,Nekonny,trick for?

18-03-2021T20:37:19,SageSaga,"like ""All i can do is manipulate air- great if you're hot or want to look up skirts but otherwise it's useleeeeesss!"""

18-03-2021T20:51:36,TeapotOfDoom,passive perception?
18-03-2021T20:51:53,TeapotOfDoom,(which is broken imo)
18-03-2021T20:52:13,Ordithus,yee the way to pass perception checks is to not have to roll them
18-03-2021T20:52:19,TeapotOfDoom,exactly
18-03-2021T20:52:30,Ordithus,"""roll perception"""
18-03-2021T20:52:32,TeapotOfDoom,we have a rogue in our party with 19 passive i think
18-03-2021T20:52:32,Ordithus,rolls a 1
18-03-2021T20:52:41,TeapotOfDoom,he just foregoes his rolls
18-03-2021T20:53:05,TeapotOfDoom,because it's more dangerous for him to roll bad than to not roll at all
18-03-2021T20:53:23,SageSaga,the cleric in the thursday game has a passive perception of 23 atm
18-03-2021T20:53:29,TeapotOfDoom,JESUSU
18-03-2021T20:53:35,Ordithus,wowie
18-03-2021T20:53:54,Mihari,I could have 24 if I really wanted too :P
18-03-2021T20:54:08,Ordithus,my cleric has 21!

18-03-2021T20:54:36,Ordithus,"not really, just level 17"
18-03-2021T20:54:38,FreedomCrusader,Rogue with 19? So he is only lvl 1 then
18-03-2021T20:54:41,SageSaga,oh yeah- she can take Observant still-
18-03-2021T20:54:49,TeapotOfDoom,lol freedom
18-03-2021T20:54:52,Mihari,The cleric or me?
18-03-2021T20:54:53,TeapotOfDoom,why are you still up
18-03-2021T20:55:02,SageSaga,the cleric-  well both of you could-
18-03-2021T20:55:06,FreedomCrusader,I woke up after 3 hours sleep
18-03-2021T20:55:06,TeapotOfDoom,you should be in bed
18-03-2021T20:55:12,FreedomCrusader,I am in bed
18-03-2021T20:55:19,TeapotOfDoom,that's not how this works
18-03-2021T20:55:23,TeapotOfDoom,and you know it
18-03-2021T20:55:24,Mihari,Wis is probably higher than mine
18-03-2021T20:55:31,SageSaga,yeah the cleric got a Sentinel Shield- that thing is nuts
18-03-2021T20:55:35,FreedomCrusader,But dreamt I was being chased by velociraptors and that woke me up
18-03-2021T20:55:45,CrRAR,that'll do it
18-03-2021T20:55:47,TeapotOfDoom,you got clevergirled?
18-03-2021T20:55:52,SageSaga,advantage on perception- which gives you +5 to your passive
18-03-2021T20:56:05,Mihari,I have advantage on perception...
18-03-2021T20:56:16,SageSaga,then you should have a +5
18-03-2021T20:56:24,TeapotOfDoom,oh god
18-03-2021T20:56:29,Mihari,I took those eagle eye goggles since no else said anything
18-03-2021T20:56:31,SageSaga,DnD beyond will do that automatically
18-03-2021T20:56:38,TeapotOfDoom,you're just digging your own grave sage lol
18-03-2021T20:56:38,SpaceCadety,The Jurassic park dramatized versions?  Or a herd of angry murderturkeys?
18-03-2021T20:56:40,SageSaga,everyone kinda ignored em-
18-03-2021T20:56:50,Mihari,"I didn't, I Just expected someone to speak up"
18-03-2021T20:57:00,Mihari,I felt bad taking another item since I've taken so many
18-03-2021T20:57:05,FreedomCrusader,"Passive perception id just way too easy to get high, even without any bonuses it already starts at the average flat duce roll"
18-03-2021T20:57:25,Ordithus,oh wait my cleric is lvl 18 when did that happen...
18-03-2021T20:57:29,FreedomCrusader,Thr dramatized version

18-03-2021T20:57:52,SageSaga,XD this cleric is level 5 with the 23 pass. perception
18-03-2021T20:58:04,Ordithus,:ptv-ohmy:
18-03-2021T20:58:17,TeapotOfDoom,what even is a perception check at that point
18-03-2021T20:58:31,SageSaga,just what it has always been
18-03-2021T20:58:42,SageSaga,your ability to notice something the DM wants or doesnt want you to see
18-03-2021T20:58:48,SpaceCadety,"Aw, so we get to continue wondering if she's a smoke monster, or baby dragon."
18-03-2021T20:58:57,CrRAR,at least she spared him the face-melting terror
18-03-2021T20:59:08,CrRAR,"just, horrifying terror"
18-03-2021T20:59:14,TeapotOfDoom,i mean fair but like i said our rogue just forgoes his rolls and uses his passive perception instead
18-03-2021T20:59:22,TeapotOfDoom,our dm just kinda gave up on that
18-03-2021T20:59:45,Ordithus,rolls can make it more fun though. that random element. could always roll a 1~
18-03-2021T20:59:55,FreedomCrusader,Reasons my dm jusy don't use our passive perception
18-03-2021T20:59:59,SpaceCadety,"If she is a baby dragon, I suspect whatever her parents would do to this fool for attacking her would be... unpleasant."
18-03-2021T21:00:12,SageSaga,rolling can also bog everything down- Perception is just used so often it make sense to automate its use
18-03-2021T21:00:21,TeapotOfDoom,honestly i'd not use it either. you can just pump it way too easily
18-03-2021T21:00:23,CrRAR,:sparkles::lizard:
18-03-2021T21:01:00,SageSaga,if people want to be able to notice stuff so much i say let em- it just means they get to see the rocks fall when they get crushed by them
18-03-2021T21:01:11,Ordithus,it's meant to be situational. useful to just take the averages
18-03-2021T21:01:12,TeapotOfDoom,lol
18-03-2021T21:01:25,Ordithus,instead of rolling every time

18-03-2021T21:01:45,FreedomCrusader,"My dm basically plays it like if anything is actively hiding from us we can't notice it with passive perception, counting if objects or such was hidden by someone as well"
18-03-2021T21:01:55,TeapotOfDoom,you can make them paranoid by letting them roll empty checks
18-03-2021T21:02:09,SageSaga,i personally prefer telling people what they see rather than coming up with a reason for why the fighter is suddenly blind with this roll of -2
18-03-2021T21:02:33,TeapotOfDoom,something slaps in his face

18-03-2021T22:36:44,Ordithus,that railing. Clovis is really to blame for yet another of his minions' deaths
18-03-2021T22:37:09,Roughlandin,Rom better file a worker's comp claim
18-03-2021T22:37:16,Roughlandin,That's a safety hazard
18-03-2021T22:37:36,Roughlandin,"I'd say Rem should file it, but... well..."
18-03-2021T22:37:41,USNMM3,Rom shoulda packed a parachute... or at least a bunjee cord. XD

18-03-2021T22:38:36,Roughlandin,Rom is the one heading for Zen and Kat. He could ask Kat to knit a parachute for Rem... but I think that might take a little too long
18-03-2021T22:39:05,USNMM3,Speed knitting. XD
18-03-2021T22:39:17,SpaceCadety,"Oh, used up the emergency mana supplies on petty cruelty?  Guess it's crunch time then."
18-03-2021T22:39:29,Roughlandin,@ZapiliDver Smh. There's always some reason these comp claims don't go through...
