14-01-2022T00:39:06,MatyMaty,"Oooh, okay people question"
14-01-2022T00:39:18,Ordithus,lots of booty these streams
14-01-2022T00:39:24,InTheLionsDen,No new ones but some old ones are still outstanding
14-01-2022T00:39:26,MatyMaty,so this animation WiP sage has on right now has a kinda high frame number
14-01-2022T00:39:35,MatyMaty,almost 3 times the amount the other two
14-01-2022T00:39:41,MatyMaty,does it look better or nah?
14-01-2022T00:40:13,Ordithus,"it is definitely smoother, but the others are plenty enough to work"
14-01-2022T00:40:20,MachGao,yeah 
14-01-2022T00:40:23,MachGao,its very smooth
14-01-2022T00:40:41,MachGao,but im not sure if it would work the same way if you were trying to do something like the ball bounce
14-01-2022T00:40:42,MachGao,maybe
14-01-2022T00:40:44,MatyMaty,Mmmm I might lower the frame count then.
14-01-2022T00:40:53,MatyMaty,the ball bounce has like... 12 frames
14-01-2022T00:40:59,KeefMcDerpface,:eyes: back
14-01-2022T00:41:08,MatyMaty,the legs up one like 18 or 20
14-01-2022T00:41:25,MatyMaty,the WiP one would end up with like 50 or 60
14-01-2022T00:41:35,MatyMaty,but I wonder if that's overdoing it
14-01-2022T00:41:44,mingun,"@Twokinds Tom, will you be publish this colored sketch, Bare Rose from 2020-08-20?"
14-01-2022T00:41:58,Ordithus,"better, but diminishing returns are very much a thing"
14-01-2022T00:43:03,MachGao, the WiP does look good but did you intend for it to have that many frames or it just happened?
14-01-2022T00:43:13,MachGao,sorry im not super knowledgeable on animation work
14-01-2022T00:43:41,MatyMaty,I tried making it longer to get a smoother look. buuut I am not sure if if is worth the effort
14-01-2022T00:43:43,SageSaga,ok to close it? XD
14-01-2022T00:44:12,MatyMaty,also still not sure if catboy (as it is now) or catgirl XD
14-01-2022T00:44:20,Twokinds,yes
14-01-2022T00:44:25,Ordithus,oh dear
14-01-2022T00:44:29,MachGao,...i didnt even notice that was a femboy
14-01-2022T00:44:47,KeefMcDerpface,same
14-01-2022T00:45:18,MachGao,i think you could get away with it having the same  amount of frames as the other two
14-01-2022T00:45:28,MatyMaty,"alrighty, I think I will do that"
14-01-2022T00:46:41,MachGao,and now sage has to leave the WiP there for the rest of the stream
14-01-2022T00:48:32,MachGao,"yeah, no need to make more work for yourself than necessary "
14-01-2022T00:48:32,MatyMaty,I guess the downside is that one of the current anims will have to go 
14-01-2022T00:48:41,MatyMaty,once a new one happens
14-01-2022T00:48:51,MachGao,maybe the current leg one
14-01-2022T00:48:55,MachGao,the new one becomes legs part 2
14-01-2022T00:49:14,MachGao,legs: Boy edition 
14-01-2022T00:49:26,Ordithus,eventually sage's stream will just be maty animations
14-01-2022T00:49:32,MatyMaty,Lol Ord
14-01-2022T00:49:35,KeefMcDerpface,hah
14-01-2022T00:50:08,MatyMaty,But now I must go to bed. Thank you for the streams Sage and Tom! Seeya everyone!

14-01-2022T16:53:47,SageSaga,its one of those puzzles where you move things- they all move at the same time- then you just need to block them to line them up

14-01-2022T16:56:01,CrRAR,sorry to hear that mystic
14-01-2022T16:56:03,SageSaga,sorry  to hear that T_T
14-01-2022T16:56:25,Ordithus,"that's awful, sorry, mystic"
14-01-2022T16:56:32,MysticWav,Thanks.
14-01-2022T16:57:42,MysticWav,I'm getting a lot of good support.
14-01-2022T17:00:32,MysticWav,So what are some of everyone's favorite videogames from their formative years?
14-01-2022T17:00:46,Ordithus,Spyro! The original PS1 games
14-01-2022T17:07:02,Ordithus,"Also, Final Fantasy Tactics. Sad my copy no longer wants to work"
14-01-2022T17:07:57,SageSaga,i too want to say FFT but- it was not in my formative years-
14-01-2022T17:09:09,SageSaga,FF6 though- closer-
14-01-2022T17:09:27,SageSaga,probably the Kings Quests series though-
14-01-2022T17:09:30,MysticWav,Good picks
14-01-2022T17:10:33,SageSaga,"""Ah, life giving water, nectar of the gods"""
14-01-2022T17:12:18,SageSaga,oh and Hero Quest- though that wasnt a video game-
14-01-2022T17:12:20,MysticWav,"I wonder if you could find it on one of the modern platforms, Ord."
14-01-2022T17:12:35,MysticWav,"Wait, like the D&D light board game?"
14-01-2022T17:12:41,SageSaga,yep
14-01-2022T17:12:59,MysticWav,Nice.  My poor parents having to play that with me.
14-01-2022T17:13:14,SageSaga,also played DnD 2nd edition but not much- we reaally started playing dnd with 3rd edition though
14-01-2022T17:13:20,Ordithus,"it sort of exists as a gameboy advance game and ios and android versions. but none of them are really the original, I think"
14-01-2022T17:13:57,SageSaga,there is a mobile version of FFT and yeah- its - not great unless they fixed it-
14-01-2022T17:14:28,Ordithus,probably easier to find a functioning ps1 disc
14-01-2022T17:14:36,SageSaga,but not cheaper-
14-01-2022T17:14:50,Ordithus,"true, but it isn't horribly expensive, eithr"
14-01-2022T17:14:54,SageSaga,original FFT disks last i saw were selling for 100 bucks
14-01-2022T17:16:03,SageSaga,oh!
14-01-2022T17:16:52,SageSaga,they did the greatest hits run of PS1 games and FFT was reprinted then- so there should be a lot out there- and yeah you can get just the disk for 10-20 bucks- not sure if they are in decent condition
14-01-2022T17:17:05,Ordithus,"mine is greatest hits, already"
14-01-2022T17:17:08,SageSaga,but if you wanted an unopened copy they are like 120 for collectors
14-01-2022T17:17:18,MysticWav,After Hero Quest I diverged off into Battletech.  Didn't get back to table top RPGs until 4th
14-01-2022T17:17:22,Ordithus,I would be happy with a good condition disc
14-01-2022T17:17:50,SageSaga,4th edition was a dark time for DnD
14-01-2022T17:20:03,SageSaga,"4th edition itself wasnt as bad as most people say it was- but- it did cause some major issues, and those responsible for the lore and stuff were pretty upset over all the changes that were made to ""simplify"" the world"
14-01-2022T17:20:41,SageSaga,so when 5th edition came out and they had the opportunity- they retconned a ton of stuff
14-01-2022T17:21:22,Hogan,*shudders* I made it only a bit into the PHB 4th edition before I ditched the entire edition
14-01-2022T17:21:31,MysticWav,It felt very much like an attempt to capitalize on the WoW craze of the time
14-01-2022T17:22:00,Ordithus,5th ed is the only dnd I know
14-01-2022T17:22:28,Hogan,I'm a child of the second edition XD
14-01-2022T17:24:33,SageSaga,you were conceived during a second edition game?
14-01-2022T17:26:03,SageSaga,they took role play serious back in the day

14-01-2022T17:30:02,Hogan,... and where you could exceed 100%  to make up for the negative modifiers...

14-01-2022T21:18:52,SpazztasticKiwi,how you gonna rant about the unfairness of having your new shiny ride booted cause of all the money you spent on it when you‚Äôve been sitting on $2000 of parking tickets 
14-01-2022T21:20:43,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI know I got like 6 tickets but...‚Äù

14-01-2022T21:30:09,Ordithus,like a darwin award
14-01-2022T21:34:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I guess he just parks wherever & throws the tickets off his windshield when he gets back 
14-01-2022T21:35:46,SpazztasticKiwi,at some point tho you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd be flagged for immediate towing the next time somebody tries to write that registration a ticket 
14-01-2022T21:37:38,SpazztasticKiwi,im hoping they don‚Äôt have anything on my car from nashville cause I went through about 2 yellow lights & idunno how loose they are with them
14-01-2022T21:38:51,CrRAR,"eh, traffic camera enforcement luckily hasn‚Äôt caught on big in the US"
14-01-2022T21:39:37,CrRAR,I think where they use them they‚Äôre for where safety has been a serious problem when people ignore basic rules
14-01-2022T21:40:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw a few
14-01-2022T21:41:00,SpazztasticKiwi,so i know there‚Äôs a chance if it was red after I passed
14-01-2022T21:41:26,CrRAR,"fin fact about a lot of intersections... the solid line (after the dotted ends) approaching an intersection roughly is the ‚Äòdistance‚Äô you have before a yellow turns red, taking speed limit for the road into account"
14-01-2022T21:41:32,CrRAR,*fun
14-01-2022T21:42:02,Ordithus,":cw0lfmare-EmberO: neat, we don't have that here"
14-01-2022T21:42:11,CrRAR,"so like, if you‚Äôre headed toward a light and it turns yellow and you‚Äôre not within the solid zone, you‚Äôre better off stopping"
14-01-2022T21:42:16,Ordithus,half the time the lines are all but gone thanks to salt and snow plows
14-01-2022T21:42:37,CrRAR,yeah I‚Äôd imagine not everywhere would have them
14-01-2022T21:42:45,CrRAR,depends on the locality
14-01-2022T21:42:50,SpazztasticKiwi,far as I could tell they were yellow while I was under em
14-01-2022T21:43:20,Ordithus,"I can't speak for all states, but for the most part if you entered yellow you're fine. entering red is the no-no"
14-01-2022T21:43:34,CrRAR,"yeah I mean yellow passing is okay, just gotta air on the side of caution for best practice"
14-01-2022T21:44:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I normally stop when I see yellow but the 2 times specifically here I entered the section on yellow 
14-01-2022T21:45:30,CrRAR,"yeah, it happens"
14-01-2022T21:45:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"it turned red either as I was under or after I passed, & one of em had someone pass behind me so either the yellow was longer than most or they def ran a red"
14-01-2022T21:46:17,CrRAR,"yeah it‚Äôs judged by the stop line basically, if spotted depending on how struct the cop is being, too"
14-01-2022T21:46:58,Ordithus,"there's an intersection when I leave work, turning left with the arrow, the arrow lasts way less time than it takes to actually get through"
14-01-2022T21:47:12,CrRAR,"it‚Äôs all about safety, dumb judgment is gets attention 99- of the time"
14-01-2022T21:47:41,CrRAR,yeah some turnarounds I‚Äôve seen sometimes it‚Äôs like just 1.5 cars time xD
14-01-2022T21:47:58,Ordithus,that intersection is also the most dangerous part of my commute
14-01-2022T21:48:09,Ordithus,I've seen so many semis barrel through reds there at 60+
14-01-2022T21:48:35,CrRAR,it‚Äôs a miracle some traffic circles have so few problems around here
14-01-2022T21:49:04,CrRAR,it‚Äôs like shoving 20 cars into a roller derby deathmatch sometimes
14-01-2022T21:49:15,SpazztasticKiwi,at some point it became a question if I was sure they were yellow & the fact I didn‚Äôt get pulled over but the cameras mean there could be a problem & it takes 30 days to make a judgement if they send me anything 
14-01-2022T21:50:07,SpazztasticKiwi,but I know unless my car was completely unable to stop I‚Äôd stop at a red & even sometimes at a yellow but if it‚Äôs yellow when I‚Äôm up on it I use the time to go ahead 
14-01-2022T21:50:13,CrRAR,"I think the cameras activate specifically when red pops for any one still going through, mostly where they‚Äôre actually used"
14-01-2022T21:50:27,SpazztasticKiwi,yea that‚Äôs what I read
14-01-2022T21:50:40,CrRAR,so like anyone passing ‚Äòstop‚Äô after the red is visible
14-01-2022T21:50:50,SpazztasticKiwi,oh man there‚Äôs some stories to tell
14-01-2022T21:51:27,SpazztasticKiwi,i took a trip to pay a bill & my mother wanted to come along so she wouldn‚Äôt have to drive her car 
14-01-2022T21:51:58,CrRAR,"oh no, parent ride-alongs can be the worst"
14-01-2022T21:52:00,SpazztasticKiwi,this was like months ago at this point but I was the first in a line of about 6 cars when a red truck came in my side mirror 
14-01-2022T21:52:04,SpazztasticKiwi,no pass zone
14-01-2022T21:52:12,SpazztasticKiwi,passing 6 cars 
14-01-2022T21:52:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"speeding because I was going the limit and to get around us, you‚Äôd have to speed"
14-01-2022T21:53:10,CrRAR,"those are the sketchiest, the two lane passes let alone WHEN it‚Äôs allowed"
14-01-2022T21:53:14,SpazztasticKiwi,then the third car back turned on his lights & siren
14-01-2022T21:53:30,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-karenOOO:
14-01-2022T21:53:51,CrRAR,"yeah doing that will get attention quick, that and using breakdown lanes unexpectedly"
14-01-2022T21:54:28,SpazztasticKiwi,behind me was a black truck and then the undercover was unsurprisingly a black suv
14-01-2022T21:54:32,Ordithus,there's illegal. there is unsafe. then there is unsafe and illegal :police_car: 
14-01-2022T21:54:39,CrRAR,"I‚Äôm honestly surprised the single lane passing is still so widely allowed in places, the roads are just so crazy these days"
14-01-2022T21:55:58,SpazztasticKiwi,i remember a  white car in our little follow the leader
14-01-2022T21:56:46,SpazztasticKiwi,i was holding all of them up but I wasn‚Äôt going over what that little sign said on the side of the road - there could be a cop somewhere  
14-01-2022T21:56:57,SpazztasticKiwi,turns out he was practically behind me but
14-01-2022T21:57:46,Ordithus,"something neat in Alaska - on a 2 lane road, if there are 5 or more cars behind you, you are required to pull over and let them pass"
14-01-2022T21:58:26,SpazztasticKiwi,i pulled over cause the cop couldn‚Äôt exactly pass us in the no pass zone either given stupid had already given the finger to the grim reaper with his stunt
14-01-2022T21:59:27,SpazztasticKiwi,but the lady in the truck behind me didn‚Äôt pull over right off - I‚Äôm hoping they caught him but the cop had a hang up there
14-01-2022T22:00:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"I knew as soon as he turned on his lights, he was after that truck & not me but at the same time you‚Äôre supposed to move over anyway "
14-01-2022T22:02:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"same town, I was leaving after paying a different bill & a fire rescue truck lights up right behind me at a stop sign "
14-01-2022T22:02:43,SpazztasticKiwi,nothing like a siren sounding right behind you at a stop
14-01-2022T22:03:32,SpazztasticKiwi,facinating to see how many people I‚Äôve seen fail to pull over for a firetruck or cop with lights on

14-01-2022T22:47:33,CrRAR,lil miss Maggie sounds like a decent name for the mama cat
14-01-2022T22:47:47,CrRAR,or maybe Margie :thinking: 
14-01-2022T22:48:39,CrRAR,"do you get to name her, or is she just a temporary foster type visit?"
