19-12-2021T19:12:30,Twokinds,Maren is a free elf. Or she would be if she still had her elf ears from her original design.
19-12-2021T19:12:39,AspiringNoodle,*gasp*
19-12-2021T19:12:40,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-nathaha_xmas:
19-12-2021T19:12:41,Twokinds,Nibbs plush eventually.
19-12-2021T19:12:46,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-excited: 
19-12-2021T19:13:30,AspiringNoodle,"While I hate to break us away from the more pleasant conversation, I feel like I'll continue where Dadro left off"
19-12-2021T19:15:15,AspiringNoodle,"When these well-paying middle class trucking jobs are all but annihilated due to self-driving trucks, the government is still probably going to blow smoke up their own ass about new jobs being made and unemployment being low. "
19-12-2021T19:15:43,AspiringNoodle,"Completely ignoring the fact that unemployment is arguably the most meaningless employment metric ever conceived, because it ignores so much of the larger picture."
19-12-2021T19:16:33,AspiringNoodle,Such as people just opting out of work because it's either government benefits or some shitty paying customer service job when so many customers in America are entitle pricks
19-12-2021T19:16:47,CrRAR,"yeah, quantity not quality :ptv-sad:"
19-12-2021T19:16:59,AspiringNoodle,"Or the fact that people are working 2 - 3 jobs and still just *barely* scraping by, while having 0 ability to save / invest."
19-12-2021T19:17:35,AspiringNoodle,Or that most of the new jobs being made are in the customer service sector.
19-12-2021T19:17:39,AspiringNoodle,And so on.
19-12-2021T19:18:39,AspiringNoodle,"But it's fine, no need to change CEO's and executives giving themselves tens to hundreds of millions in bonuses every year while simultaneously laying off hundreds to thousands of employees on record years"
19-12-2021T19:19:49,AspiringNoodle,"Or companies cheaping out on construction and weather safety for a, say, giant effing warehouse built smack dab in tornado alley that just partially collapsed and killed 6?"
19-12-2021T19:28:38,CrRAR,"yeah, it's because the reward system and definition of doing a 'good job' and achieving 'success' becomes more and more skewed toward the bottom line and not the product/job satisfaction higher up the ladder you go"
19-12-2021T19:29:10,CrRAR,it used to be enough that all pulling the same direction toward making a good product = a good business
19-12-2021T19:29:37,CrRAR,it's not quite that simple anymore

19-12-2021T21:02:50,Dadrobit,"Oh, a ""Good"" business is still very much possible. Look at Costco. But the goal isn't a ""Good"" business. It's ""Make a business that pulls in ALL of the money ALL of the time for infinitely increasing returns for the investors"" "

19-12-2021T21:51:16,CrRAR,we only got a yard of crusty snow patches here so far
19-12-2021T21:51:29,CrRAR,it’s like all we got so far was that pitiful cloud from the Rocko’s Modern Life holiday special come by
19-12-2021T22:00:24,Ordithus,"it hasn't been a lot of snow, really. thankful for that."
19-12-2021T22:00:33,Ordithus,frequent little snows it seems
19-12-2021T22:01:19,Ordithus,"almost done christmas shopping! one more little thing for the nephew, then done"
19-12-2021T22:05:05,AspiringNoodle,Dadro understands completely \o/
19-12-2021T22:05:28,AspiringNoodle,Investors / shareholders demand sustained indefinite growth from companies.
19-12-2021T22:05:42,AspiringNoodle,"And if you don't do everything in your power to keep growing, they will sue you for not making enough money for them."
19-12-2021T22:05:47,Ordithus,":ctwokinds-clovis_xmas: if you're not growing, you're dying"
19-12-2021T22:06:03,AspiringNoodle,Investors / shareholders will be a big reason to blame should the economy fail
19-12-2021T22:06:14,AspiringNoodle,They have a very short-sighted mentality that is not healthy.
19-12-2021T22:06:29,AspiringNoodle,Companies should be focused on sustainable growth and long-term stability.
19-12-2021T22:07:07,AspiringNoodle,But that's the kind of leadership that will get you sued out of the company by those greedy mothereffers.
19-12-2021T22:07:35,CrRAR,"yeah, I mean every economic reset is the result of everyone stampeding off a cliff chasing the juiciest sources of profit"
19-12-2021T22:07:58,CrRAR,like lemmings!
19-12-2021T22:10:45,Ordithus,done shopping \o/
19-12-2021T22:11:00,Ordithus,the mechanisms of capitalism have been greased :cw0lfmare-Paperflora:
