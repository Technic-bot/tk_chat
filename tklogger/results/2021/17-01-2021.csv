17-01-2021T18:05:29,CrimsonQuill,Oh and I finally watched wolfwalker trailer. It cannot come out on film soon enough.
17-01-2021T18:05:50,CrimsonQuill,I also see Lobster Helmets...so the film must be during Cromwell's massacres.
17-01-2021T18:06:24,CrimsonQuill,That was a very black time indeed.

17-01-2021T18:35:18,CrimsonQuill,"In Europe, it's mandatory that there's at least a month of time set aside for holidays, usually in 2 week blocks or summat...though employers like to exploit loopholes sometimes.."
17-01-2021T18:35:49,CrRAR,It‚Äôs funny because it‚Äôs a double standard comparing higher up the chain and the more common workers
17-01-2021T18:35:58,CrRAR,"‚ÄúRules for thee, not for me‚Äù"
17-01-2021T18:37:04,CrRAR,The same work groups too that used to allow more flexibility have whittled down over time too in favor of ‚Äòcost savings‚Äô
17-01-2021T18:37:58,CrRAR,"So like where there were pools of workers potentially on schedule, the size of that type of thing has shrunk over time"
17-01-2021T18:38:05,CrRAR,"So, less coverage"
17-01-2021T18:38:51,CrimsonQuill,"So, basically 'more money for me' again."
17-01-2021T18:39:04,CrRAR,yeap

17-01-2021T18:42:04,CrRAR,I feel like laws have more bent toward the side of employers‚Äô rights?
17-01-2021T18:42:12,CrRAR,I‚Äôm not really sure
17-01-2021T18:42:40,CrRAR,I just feel like unions in general have less teeth than they used to where they exist
17-01-2021T18:43:45,CrRAR,Cuz the whole personal governance/negotiaton became the selling point of modern employment
17-01-2021T18:44:11,CrRAR,Which works for a good amount of the workforce
17-01-2021T18:44:36,CrRAR,It‚Äôs more free market rules vs regulation
17-01-2021T18:45:19,CrRAR,Free market being the one-for-all-all-for-one leave-if-you-don‚Äôt-like-it mentality
17-01-2021T18:46:05,CrimsonQuill,...that might not work in the long run.
17-01-2021T18:46:21,CrRAR,But it‚Äôs easier for big players (i.e. employers) to game a ‚Äòfree market‚Äô
17-01-2021T18:46:25,CrRAR,Yeah

17-01-2021T18:46:54,CrRAR,Individuals overall have very little influence over a market overall

17-01-2021T18:48:01,CrRAR,Yeah the free market works best for those with some sort of specialized skills
