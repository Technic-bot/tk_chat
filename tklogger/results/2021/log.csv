09-01-2021T18:06:29,CrimsonQuill,It's like an upturned plug.

09-01-2021T18:06:56,ThingsAreMoving,"Quill, the only thing more dangerous than an upturned UK plug is a goddamn landmine."
09-01-2021T18:07:03,Roughlandin,No relation to Flora that we know of

09-01-2021T18:07:19,Skornos,At least that!
09-01-2021T18:07:40,Roughlandin,Also on the opposite side of the continent. Willow's story takes place near the Riftwall West
09-01-2021T18:07:46,CrimsonQuill,@ThingsAreMoving You could say that...
09-01-2021T18:07:48,Dadrobit,Do you often leave power plugs upturned on the ground?
09-01-2021T18:07:53,CrimsonQuill,Not really.
09-01-2021T18:07:56,CrimsonQuill,Just pack 'em away

09-01-2021T18:08:06,Sesarag,Oh boi
09-01-2021T18:08:16,Dadrobit,Masochism runs deep in you
09-01-2021T18:08:17,CrimsonQuill,"That being said...if I had my way, I'd force the Uk/Ireland plug upon the entire world."
09-01-2021T18:08:27,CrimsonQuill,The Tyranny of the 3-pin block plug!
09-01-2021T18:08:33,Ordithus,Aren't the prongs insulated?
09-01-2021T18:08:33,ZapiliDver,"Pfff, unisolated wires is better"
09-01-2021T18:08:39,Roughlandin,And thus the second Revolutionary War was begun
09-01-2021T18:08:42,Ordithus,So less zappy than US plugs?
09-01-2021T18:08:44,LunarSchnitzel,Death cables are the way to go
09-01-2021T18:08:45,Sesarag,"We have the weird two pin plug, not the american ones"
09-01-2021T18:08:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Upturned power plugs and a bed of lose legos.  If you do that, then you'll become indestructible"
09-01-2021T18:08:55,Dadrobit,The safe word is Hertz. Make sure your enunciation is up to par
09-01-2021T18:09:00,Sesarag,The angled one
09-01-2021T18:09:01,CrimsonQuill,"@Ordithus more or less, and nicer to use in my opinion."
09-01-2021T18:09:29,ThingsAreMoving,I feel like EU or US two prong plugs are way better
09-01-2021T18:09:37,CrimsonQuill,How so?
09-01-2021T18:09:44,CrimsonQuill,I'm genuinely curious
09-01-2021T18:09:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Us has 3 prongs
09-01-2021T18:09:52,ThingsAreMoving,does it?
09-01-2021T18:09:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Most of the time at lieast
09-01-2021T18:09:57,ThingsAreMoving,huh
09-01-2021T18:09:58,Ordithus,3 for grounded
09-01-2021T18:09:58,TeapotOfDoom,eu has 3 as well
09-01-2021T18:09:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,least*
09-01-2021T18:10:00,Dadrobit,The third prong is ground yo. That's kinda a good thing.
09-01-2021T18:10:01,Roughlandin,Some US cords have 2. Aren't those groundless?
09-01-2021T18:10:06,CrRAR,Yup
09-01-2021T18:10:11,LunarSchnitzel,2 prongers are dangerous
09-01-2021T18:10:13,Ordithus,lots of small electronics are 2 prong
09-01-2021T18:10:17,Ordithus,perfectly safe
09-01-2021T18:10:18,Roughlandin,Yeah ground is a nice thing to be connected to
09-01-2021T18:10:34,Ordithus,the appliance has to be insulated twice to use 2 prongs
09-01-2021T18:10:35,ThingsAreMoving,I only dealt with 2 prong plugs in mainland EU
09-01-2021T18:11:04,Ordithus,I know this because my house predates grounding being a required part of electrical code...
09-01-2021T18:11:05,KeefMcDerpface,back
09-01-2021T18:11:10,ThingsAreMoving,But I was sure US had two prong plugs. Guess you can learn new things everyday.
09-01-2021T18:11:11,Roughlandin,wb
09-01-2021T18:11:27,CrimsonQuill,wb
09-01-2021T18:11:30,ThingsAreMoving,wb
09-01-2021T18:11:36,ZapiliDver,Schuko plug also can be guessed as 3 prong plug
09-01-2021T18:11:40,LunarSchnitzel,US outlets are 3 pronged but smaller electronics can have 2 prongs that fit in the same outlet
09-01-2021T18:11:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Depending on the size and draw of the appliance, U.S can go from 2, 3 or even 4 prongs"
09-01-2021T18:12:00,Ordithus,4 is for things like a clothes dryer
09-01-2021T18:12:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,^
09-01-2021T18:12:10,Grip,Third part is the ground

09-01-2021T18:12:13,Roughlandin,Beeg plug
09-01-2021T18:12:14,LunarSchnitzel,4 is something that gets plugged in once and is never touched again

09-01-2021T18:12:40,CrRAR,Yeah 240v
09-01-2021T18:12:46,TeapotOfDoom,that is normally 5 prong tho
09-01-2021T18:12:50,ThingsAreMoving,Well If I ever visit the US I won't be surprised with your multi-prong plugs. Nice! :ctwokinds-rainehappy:
09-01-2021T18:12:55,TeapotOfDoom,"3 phases, 1 ground, 1 neutral"
09-01-2021T18:13:00,Sesarag,Yes!
09-01-2021T18:13:03,Roughlandin,And 1 to grow on
09-01-2021T18:13:13,Ordithus,won't find that in a house
09-01-2021T18:13:29,TeapotOfDoom,you also can always find the ground one easily cus it's always the longest one
09-01-2021T18:13:34,ZapiliDver,http://directlot.ru/img-lot/52/l255251-1.jpg <- 4 prong nightmare from ussr with love =)
09-01-2021T18:13:40,TeapotOfDoom,cus it has to connect first and disconnect last
09-01-2021T18:13:49,WINDOWS98SE,4 prong is also for backfeeding.
09-01-2021T18:13:49,TeapotOfDoom,also
09-01-2021T18:13:51,ZapiliDver,Step on it and loose your leg
09-01-2021T18:13:56,TeapotOfDoom,why are we discussing power plugs
09-01-2021T18:13:59,ThingsAreMoving,why not

09-01-2021T18:43:49,Dragusthor,it's very good
09-01-2021T18:43:53,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-Saltyember: maybe Willow never knew her name
09-01-2021T18:44:03,Sesarag,hmm
09-01-2021T18:44:04,TeapotOfDoom,i suppose she would
09-01-2021T18:44:05,Skornos,"So, has she the actual body of her friend? Or just the shape of it?"
09-01-2021T18:44:16,Twokinds,I don't wanna say which way specifically I'm not sure
09-01-2021T18:44:16,unsteddyphoenix,Whats a morbid name
09-01-2021T18:44:22,Dadrobit,Coulda sworn way back Tom said Willow materialized a body in her form? Avoids the zombie factor.
09-01-2021T18:44:27,Roughlandin,"Willow: ""I just called her... friend."""
09-01-2021T18:44:29,Twokinds,Yeah prob
09-01-2021T18:45:02,unsteddyphoenix,naaah lets go zombies
09-01-2021T18:45:02,Roughlandin,It's a wibbly wobbly pre-story thing. Got it
09-01-2021T18:45:05,Dragusthor,Hi Sammit
09-01-2021T18:45:12,IronHorseComics,"or you could be an asshole, call her Steve, and say her parents were jerks"
09-01-2021T18:45:20,unsteddyphoenix,"I kinda like that rough, maybe its better if she doesnt have a name"
09-01-2021T18:45:26,ThingsAreMoving,^
09-01-2021T18:45:26,Roughlandin,Her name was Isgona Di

09-01-2021T18:45:31,Avolendi,"Ah okay, at least we know then it's undefined ^^;"
09-01-2021T18:45:39,ZapiliDver,Her name was Joseph Stalin

09-01-2021T18:45:46,NDR548,i just hope we see them see each other again
09-01-2021T18:46:15,Roughlandin,I like the idea that Willow didn't know what names were before she met her friend so she just never learned it
09-01-2021T18:46:45,MoonDance,How about Kenya
09-01-2021T18:46:54,steelabjur,"Creating the body would also explain the dumb factor when Wilow's too far away, one would assume there might be lingering intelligence from the former owner in there otherwise that might not be happy with being a meat puppet."

09-01-2021T18:47:07,CrRAR,yeah
09-01-2021T18:47:11,Dragusthor,ah
09-01-2021T18:47:33,MoonDance,There is no color to a dead body so seems accurate
09-01-2021T18:47:36,Avolendi,"To add some to the feels, how about, she named Willow (not sure if that was defined actually) and she said she'd tell Willow her name after they got out of the forest, confident they'd make it"
09-01-2021T18:47:44,Dadrobit,"Nah, steel. Tom mentioned that it's just coming up with its own personality when she leaves it for too long, not that the old one is coming back."
09-01-2021T18:47:46,TeapotOfDoom,she lost her color to time
09-01-2021T18:47:56,Twokinds,"She slipped in the rain and slid down a steep hill, catching a branch at the bottom. She tried to bandage it but bled out."

09-01-2021T23:44:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm surprised whispers didn‚Äôt give me trouble when I turned them on
09-01-2021T23:44:50,Roughlandin,"My theory is Raine's push was actually strong enough to pop Carver out on the FAR side of the Isles, but he got stopped by magical interference from all the crystals in Nora's cave"
09-01-2021T23:44:51,SpaceCadety,Does Euchre know about Rose's condition?
09-01-2021T23:45:06,hyneria,I would assume so
09-01-2021T23:45:21,hyneria,but maybe he wasn't aware of Detritus
09-01-2021T23:45:48,steelabjur,"No idea, you'd think a magic user as powerful as Euchre would notice something like that."
09-01-2021T23:45:49,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,he did warn her to keep trace and co away from the 3rd floor
09-01-2021T23:45:50,ProsePro7,Wasn Detritus the thing he warned Rose about though
09-01-2021T23:46:00,Roughlandin,I think Trace kept Detritus pretty close to the chest
09-01-2021T23:46:04,MoonDance,He probably snoops around too
09-01-2021T23:46:10,SpaceCadety,"I mean, I don't see either Rose or Trace telling him about it."
09-01-2021T23:46:11,CrimsonHelsing,"He knew something was in the estate, just not what or who. All he knew was it was something Trace kept secret"
09-01-2021T23:46:19,Roughlandin,I'm betting Euchre heard rumors Trace did some spooky stuff in that manor yeah
09-01-2021T23:46:20,hyneria,"Oh I mean I imagine he knew something bad was there, but not exactly sure what}"
09-01-2021T23:46:38,hyneria,Otherwise I think he would have been a lot more worried
09-01-2021T23:46:45,SpaceCadety,"One is estranged from him, and the other was busy being a paranoid lunatic."
09-01-2021T23:47:03,steelabjur,"I think Euchre wanted to keep Trace from his experiments, in case they made him remember (and go genecidal again))"
09-01-2021T23:47:19,Roughlandin,He probably didn't know Trace's plans for Maren either
09-01-2021T23:47:20,IronHorseComics,there's a possibility
09-01-2021T23:47:47,CrimsonHelsing,If he did he would have been telling Rise to kick Maren out
09-01-2021T23:47:53,hyneria,"I really like all the twists in the current chapter. We all knew RealTrace was bad, but this has shown he was a true monster"
09-01-2021T23:47:54,BADBackgroundProductions,Alright I think that‚Äôs about it for me tonight
09-01-2021T23:47:57,SpazztasticKiwi,man this üçøsure is good
09-01-2021T23:48:07,CrRAR,Is it just buttery?
09-01-2021T23:48:11,hyneria,separating him even further from GoodTrace
09-01-2021T23:48:18,Roughlandin,Snack and a show
09-01-2021T23:48:19,SpazztasticKiwi,buttery salty

09-01-2021T23:48:36,Roughlandin,Night BAD
09-01-2021T23:48:41,BADBackgroundProductions,Bye Everyone!
09-01-2021T23:48:41,CrRAR,Popcorn is underappreciated snac
09-01-2021T23:48:47,SpaceCadety,"I figure he probably at least guessed at Trace's attempts at resurrection, I mean he was obsessed and had gotten his sanity fried trying once already"
09-01-2021T23:49:03,steelabjur,"I mean, he WAS a genecidal maniac, that's pretty mosterous as is, hyneria."
09-01-2021T23:49:12,CrimsonHelsing,And we understand more why he was so heartbroken by the loss that he became so desperate to want it all back
09-01-2021T23:49:31,SpazztasticKiwi,you realize that without punctuation it looks like y‚Äôall are screaming in caveman speak that the ‚Äúnight BAD‚Äù
09-01-2021T23:49:39,Ordithus,Euchre also isn't the type to not make sacrifices if he thinks it is worthwhile
09-01-2021T23:49:40,CrRAR,haha
09-01-2021T23:49:53,Roughlandin,Hee hoo! Night BAD! Day GOOD!
09-01-2021T23:49:57,hyneria,yes but now he's a genocidal necromancer
09-01-2021T23:49:59,KeefMcDerpface,lol
09-01-2021T23:50:25,ProsePro7,"Night BAD, Day GOOD, Woman BEST"
09-01-2021T23:50:36,SageSaga,necromancers need to replenish materials somehow
09-01-2021T23:50:41,CrimsonHelsing,"Heh, freaking Euchre.... good ol' Tricky Deck"
09-01-2021T23:50:43,SpaceCadety,I think current Trace is closer to the pre-black magic insanity RealTrace.
09-01-2021T23:50:47,Ordithus,Sage! Hi

09-01-2021T23:52:35,hyneria,maty's animations are great
09-01-2021T23:52:42,ProsePro7,Caesar was a little more forgiving than Clovis
