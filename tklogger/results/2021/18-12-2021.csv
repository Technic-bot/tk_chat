18-12-2021T17:52:41,Roughlandin,Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
18-12-2021T17:52:56,ZapiliDver,Or just kill 'em all
18-12-2021T17:53:39,LGBTQAnimalKingdom,I also noticed that he seems to be even more reviled than Clovis but I could be wrong. I think it's the fox thing lol
18-12-2021T17:54:05,Glassan,Euchre always did know how to put himself on the winning side.
18-12-2021T17:54:13,KaplanSektyPieczarek,Did I join into a conversation about the morality of secondary character in furry comic?
18-12-2021T17:54:23,CrRAR,ahyup
18-12-2021T17:54:31,Twokinds,Euchre's all about self preservation
18-12-2021T17:54:31,ZapiliDver,"It's ok, your on twokinds chat"
18-12-2021T17:54:32,Katfeathers,:ckatfeathers-Kat_thumbsup:
18-12-2021T17:54:33,KaplanSektyPieczarek,oh well...
18-12-2021T17:54:42,LGBTQAnimalKingdom,The word of god 
18-12-2021T17:54:49,KaplanSektyPieczarek,The OP said it. It's canon now
18-12-2021T17:55:08,Roughlandin,Euchre takes care of Euchre first
18-12-2021T17:55:15,Ordithus,He definitely needs some preservative to still be kicking it
18-12-2021T17:55:21,Roughlandin,lol
18-12-2021T17:55:32,yFamous,:notes: we are the self preservation society :notes:
18-12-2021T17:55:33,ProsePro7,@Twokinds what happened in his up brining to make him like that?  Was he spoiled as a kid?
18-12-2021T17:55:43,KaplanSektyPieczarek,I have a theory: Euchre win a deal with Masks
18-12-2021T17:55:51,Twokinds,He just thinks very highly of himself.
18-12-2021T17:56:05,CrRAR,he's on quest for greatness!
18-12-2021T17:56:11,Mediawatcher37,Even though his plan balcfired on him
18-12-2021T17:56:15,KaplanSektyPieczarek,Roselyn usually puts him into his place
18-12-2021T17:56:15,Mediawatcher37,Backfired
18-12-2021T17:56:34,ProsePro7,Must have received a lot of praise for his innate talents and just developed an ego
18-12-2021T17:56:41,unsteddyphoenix,His only mistake was having a cousin
18-12-2021T17:56:51,Mediawatcher37,He does seem to care about Mary and raine at the very least
18-12-2021T17:56:55,Roughlandin,Powerful men with big egos. I'm beginning to notice a theme here
18-12-2021T17:57:13,Twokinds,"Euchre thinks of himself as a good, moral person, and believes he knows best. But when tempted, he'll always take what he wants and look out for himself, even at the expense of those he cares about."
18-12-2021T17:57:24,Mediawatcher37,Like with rose
18-12-2021T17:57:28,KaplanSektyPieczarek,"@unsteddyphoenix no, his mistake was having sex with High Templar"
18-12-2021T17:57:29,Glassan,Pretty much
18-12-2021T17:57:52,KaplanSektyPieczarek,That's why I'm nihilist
18-12-2021T17:57:52,Mediawatcher37,It does seem like he made an exception for Mary and raine
18-12-2021T17:57:52,Roughlandin,They always start out with the best of intentions
18-12-2021T17:57:54,unsteddyphoenix,Naw that was a pro strat
18-12-2021T17:57:55,CrRAR,aka a wee bit of a sociopath 
18-12-2021T17:58:04,BadFoMo,Raine is a mistake?
18-12-2021T17:58:06,Roughlandin,"When you play the game of Templars, you win or you die"
18-12-2021T17:58:10,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-raineshocked_xmas:
18-12-2021T17:58:12,Glassan,Euchre seems to be one of those who considers himself good and moral solely by virtue that he is in some way superior to others.
18-12-2021T17:58:20,KaplanSektyPieczarek,"in short, Euchre is hipocrite"
18-12-2021T17:58:28,CrRAR,children are considered preserving the self for future generations!
18-12-2021T17:58:36,CrRAR,so not completely
18-12-2021T17:58:40,Mediawatcher37,Euchre just seems to be a generally scummy person
18-12-2021T17:58:54,unsteddyphoenix,Where the parellels to reality diverge is that he actually IS superior to others in a lotta ways
18-12-2021T17:59:04,Twokinds,"He always likes to wear white to appear like a paragon of virtue, because that's his mental image of himself."
18-12-2021T17:59:18,Mediawatcher37,Man could he be any more vain
18-12-2021T17:59:19,CrRAR,what a saint
18-12-2021T17:59:20,unsteddyphoenix,Where normally guys with god complexes arent actually that talented
18-12-2021T17:59:24,Roughlandin,"There is a sort of logic to it. If he thinks he's the best choice to pull the strings, obviously the moral decision would be to make it so that he can do that"
18-12-2021T17:59:36,unsteddyphoenix,"White on white, gross fashion old man"
18-12-2021T17:59:36,KaplanSektyPieczarek,@Twokinds I have a question: Does Raine age like Keidran or human?
18-12-2021T17:59:42,Roughlandin,"And if he has to step over others to get what he wants, it's their own fault"
18-12-2021T17:59:44,Mediawatcher37,Human
18-12-2021T17:59:50,Twokinds,"Anything bad that happens is other people's fault, and the circumstances just forced his hand in doing bad things."
18-12-2021T17:59:57,Mediawatcher37,She’s 18 
18-12-2021T18:00:06,unsteddyphoenix,Death Note energy
18-12-2021T18:00:14,Mediawatcher37,Man that is vain
18-12-2021T18:00:17,CrRAR,yeah she was born human then *poinked* Keidran
18-12-2021T18:00:19,KaplanSektyPieczarek,She has white hair
18-12-2021T18:00:27,Mediawatcher37,Even though he caused that whole situation with rose
18-12-2021T18:00:47,Mediawatcher37,And was willing to let her die
18-12-2021T18:00:47,KaplanSektyPieczarek,Rose kick him in nuts when she meet him
18-12-2021T18:00:48,Ordithus,"Well, Rose get herself into trouble. Then Edmund exploted it"
18-12-2021T18:00:52,Roughlandin,"An ""Ends justify the Means"" kind of wolf"
18-12-2021T18:00:53,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, Rose caused that situation"
18-12-2021T18:01:04,CrRAR,yeah lol don
18-12-2021T18:01:05,unsteddyphoenix,And it was actually her fault
18-12-2021T18:01:10,KaplanSektyPieczarek,She cared about his cousin
18-12-2021T18:01:11,Glassan,"I wonder, was Mary always so magic/career driven, or was she optimistic like Raine when she was younger and just became more cynical over time?"
18-12-2021T18:01:14,Mediawatcher37,Ok that fair
18-12-2021T18:01:25,Mediawatcher37,But tricking Mary was entirely on him
18-12-2021T18:01:42,KaplanSektyPieczarek,@Glassan my guess: strict parents
18-12-2021T18:01:42,Roughlandin,It got him what he wanted
18-12-2021T18:01:44,Mediawatcher37,Though Mary ain’t a saint either
18-12-2021T18:01:50,hyneria,Maybe Raine ages as whatever she is at the moment. So 30 years old Raine turns keidran: dies instantly of old age
18-12-2021T18:02:02,Mediawatcher37,"Poor raine, having such garbage parents"
18-12-2021T18:02:04,unsteddyphoenix,We dunno how Mary wouldve reacted if he was honest
18-12-2021T18:02:05,KaplanSektyPieczarek,Poor Red..
18-12-2021T18:02:08,unsteddyphoenix,Though it wasnt nice to trick her
18-12-2021T18:02:14,Roughlandin,"Again, ends justify the means. If he has to trick and steal to get what he wants, that's how it is"
18-12-2021T18:02:14,Ordithus,Raine at 18 doesn't look like Laura at... 16?
18-12-2021T18:02:16,Glassan,"Euchre would even argue that he didn't 'trick' Mary, per se, but simply didn't divulge that information because it never came up."
18-12-2021T18:02:18,Roughlandin,What he wants is best
18-12-2021T18:02:19,CrRAR,"no, it scales between forms"
18-12-2021T18:02:23,Katfeathers,"With Mary it feels like a ""weels fell off"" situation"
18-12-2021T18:02:29,AspiringNoodle,Active chat :o
18-12-2021T18:02:33,Mediawatcher37,"Raine ages like a human fro, the looks of it, so she’s fine"
18-12-2021T18:02:37,Ordithus,"Though Raine already has the silver hair, so harder to tell!"
18-12-2021T18:02:38,Twokinds,"Mary never wanted a daughter with a wolf, and felt it was an unfair situation she was forced into."
18-12-2021T18:02:48,Twokinds,"In her mind, allowing Raine to live was mercy enough."
18-12-2021T18:02:56,KaplanSektyPieczarek,@Ordithus people age in their own time
18-12-2021T18:03:02,ProsePro7,I wonder if she would have felt the same if Raine were fully human
18-12-2021T18:03:05,Ordithus,True
18-12-2021T18:03:13,hyneria,I guess she shares OldTrace's feelings about having a child with a keidran
18-12-2021T18:03:18,unsteddyphoenix,Suck it up Mary the baby was human-ish
18-12-2021T18:03:46,Mediawatcher37,Raines had silver hair since she was a kid
18-12-2021T18:03:48,Ordithus,"All in all, it's not a great family situation"
18-12-2021T18:03:53,Roughlandin,Luckily Raine can pull off the human look when she wants
18-12-2021T18:04:04,Roughlandin,"You can't pick your family, but you can pick your snoot"
18-12-2021T18:04:06,Roughlandin,...Wait
18-12-2021T18:04:10,Ordithus,"No no, she can't really pick, yet"
18-12-2021T18:04:11,KaplanSektyPieczarek,"ok, you Media. Raine ages like human"
18-12-2021T18:04:32,Glassan,"Certainly not, although Raine is certainly a genuinely kind person; makes one wonder where that nature came from, given her parentage."
18-12-2021T18:04:42,KaplanSektyPieczarek,"By the way, is Mary dead?"
18-12-2021T18:04:49,Roughlandin,No
18-12-2021T18:04:49,Ordithus,Alive last we saw her
18-12-2021T18:04:50,Glassan,Na
18-12-2021T18:04:55,Mediawatcher37,No she just left raine with team b
18-12-2021T18:05:00,CrRAR,Euchre is a master of the pleasant grins
18-12-2021T18:05:03,hyneria,"so when Raine and Red have kids, will they also be part wolf? :thinking:"
18-12-2021T18:05:08,Mediawatcher37,She’ll likely return eventually
18-12-2021T18:05:09,Ordithus,She -could- be dead in a ditch somewhere
18-12-2021T18:05:11,Roughlandin,She's trying to find a way to de-wolf herself
18-12-2021T18:05:13,unsteddyphoenix,You always turn out different from your parents
18-12-2021T18:05:14,LGBTQAnimalKingdom,I think jokes have been made of her absence
18-12-2021T18:05:26,unsteddyphoenix,Raines teen rebellion is being a kind genuine person
18-12-2021T18:05:28,KaplanSektyPieczarek,Mary vs Trace...
18-12-2021T18:05:29,Twokinds,It depends on what form Raine is in.
18-12-2021T18:05:31,Ordithus,lol teddy
18-12-2021T18:05:35,Twokinds,The transformation is completely pure.
18-12-2021T18:05:38,ProsePro7,It is interesting that after Mary and Raine were reunited that Mary just ditched her...again
18-12-2021T18:05:44,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-raine_xmas: nice Raine is just a phase
18-12-2021T18:05:54,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-zenshocked_xmas:
18-12-2021T18:05:55,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah she'll become evil in her 20s
18-12-2021T18:06:01,hyneria,"so if Raine is in pure wolf form when the conception happens, they will be hybrids just like her"
18-12-2021T18:06:01,Roughlandin,":ctwokinds-raineshocked_xmas: *[You can't tell me what to do, Mom! I'm gonna stay in and study if I like!]"
18-12-2021T18:06:07,Mediawatcher37,So her kids could be wolves or humans
18-12-2021T18:06:09,AspiringNoodle,Nora-apprentice Raine is the next phase? ¦3c
18-12-2021T18:06:11,KaplanSektyPieczarek,Raine will finally snap and kill her parents
18-12-2021T18:06:25,Mediawatcher37,I’m looking forward to raine a mastering her magic
18-12-2021T18:06:28,Twokinds,"If Raine has a child with a human in human form, it'll be pure human."
18-12-2021T18:06:41,KaplanSektyPieczarek,Red approve it
18-12-2021T18:06:44,ProsePro7,Wait what?
18-12-2021T18:06:44,Ordithus,but would probably inherit the gift of perfect transformation~
18-12-2021T18:06:49,Twokinds,"It may inherit her unique ability, passed down from her father."
18-12-2021T18:06:51,Twokinds,Or it might not.
18-12-2021T18:06:53,Glassan,What Ord said.
18-12-2021T18:06:55,Roughlandin,Raine yeeted a fox halfway across the world. Masks help everybody when she learns how powerful she is.
18-12-2021T18:06:59,Ordithus,What Tom said :P

18-12-2021T18:07:49,Twokinds,What?

18-12-2021T18:08:16,Twokinds,Only certain families have special abilities.
18-12-2021T18:08:28,ProsePro7,Red is Deku
18-12-2021T18:08:32,LGBTQAnimalKingdom,He is a good actor though
18-12-2021T18:08:37,Glassan,If Deku was a jerk...
18-12-2021T18:08:37,KaplanSektyPieczarek,Trace family has something special?
18-12-2021T18:08:37,Roughlandin,Red has the magical ability to put his foot in his own mouth with a single word
18-12-2021T18:08:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,That is an insult to Deku 
18-12-2021T18:08:39,ZapiliDver,Red has a very special ability: sword replaced brain
18-12-2021T18:08:44,Mediawatcher37,Did traces mother or father have special abilities?
18-12-2021T18:08:52,CrRAR,red is a scrub confirm't then Glassan xD
18-12-2021T18:08:55,Twokinds,"No, Trace's parents were muggles."
18-12-2021T18:08:56,BadFoMo,I thought Red had a natural ability for destruction.
18-12-2021T18:09:05,unsteddyphoenix,"Red isnt Deku, its the rival"

18-12-2021T18:09:22,Roughlandin,Yeah Red is more Bakugo
18-12-2021T18:09:22,Glassan,xD
18-12-2021T18:09:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Bakugo is a good boy

18-12-2021T18:09:32,LGBTQAnimalKingdom,Confirmed. Harry Potter takes place in Twokinds
18-12-2021T18:09:37,unsteddyphoenix,Redkugo
18-12-2021T18:09:38,Rainelover,I’d like to think that raine’s child would inherit her ability 
18-12-2021T18:09:41,ProsePro7,Dammit Deku!  
18-12-2021T18:09:44,Ordithus,"hyneria, Raine isn't a hybrid - she's fully hooman with a gift for fuzziness."
18-12-2021T18:09:45,Mediawatcher37,So trace was a strange anamoly
18-12-2021T18:09:52,Roughlandin,Bakugo literally threatens to murder his classmates for the first two seasons lol
18-12-2021T18:09:57,unsteddyphoenix,"Explosions and worthless, theyre the same character"
18-12-2021T18:09:57,Ordithus,"But since Trace and Flora can have a hybrid kiddo, presumably"
18-12-2021T18:09:57,Glassan,"Red is Bakugo's mind and ego, and pre One-for-All Deku's ability."
18-12-2021T18:10:00,KaplanSektyPieczarek,I can imagine Red and Sythe working together... by burning Raine's fanfiction about them
18-12-2021T18:10:13,unsteddyphoenix,At least Red doesnt get kidnapped 4 times per season
18-12-2021T18:10:13,ProsePro7,And Red has a habit of blowing things up to so good connection 
18-12-2021T18:10:14,CrRAR,muahaha
18-12-2021T18:10:18,ZapiliDver,lol
18-12-2021T18:10:51,Roughlandin,Red has the magic ability to blow up every relationship he attempts before it even starts
18-12-2021T18:10:52,ZapiliDver,"Sythe, sorry, i've blown ur up, rest in pieces"
18-12-2021T18:10:53,hyneria,that's a fun but mean drawing idea. Raine has a wolf hybrid child so Sythe and Red argue they are the rightful father.
18-12-2021T18:11:12,ZapiliDver,is musik is gone?
18-12-2021T18:11:23,Mediawatcher37,Don’t you mean red and zen?

18-12-2021T18:12:34,hyneria,oh I said Red and Sythe because of that time Rose was asking her who was the one
18-12-2021T18:12:41,CrRAR,the... Dogfather
18-12-2021T18:12:43,ZapiliDver,lol
18-12-2021T18:12:46,CrRAR,:cw0lfmare-Paperembercool:
18-12-2021T18:12:47,LGBTQAnimalKingdom,ha!
18-12-2021T18:12:51,Glassan,*snrk*
18-12-2021T18:13:06,Ordithus,there was a time when Sythe x Raine was a thing
18-12-2021T18:13:17,KeefMcDerpface,"lol, CrRAR"
18-12-2021T18:13:19,Ordithus,"since he was actually nice to her, y'know"
18-12-2021T18:13:19,Mediawatcher37,And then sythe x Maren became a thing
18-12-2021T18:13:30,LGBTQAnimalKingdom,and we are all the better for it
18-12-2021T18:13:35,Glassan,Sythe kinda accidentally flirted with everyone.
18-12-2021T18:13:46,CrRAR,also don't forget then Sythe met Nibbly
18-12-2021T18:13:50,Azartalien,"Spieß voran, drauf und dran"

18-12-2021T18:14:09,Mediawatcher37,And now it looks like Maren is one sythe will be paired up with in canon
18-12-2021T18:14:11,CrRAR,lol
18-12-2021T18:14:12,SpaceCadety,Sythe x Raine would probably work better than Raine x Red.
18-12-2021T18:14:13,LGBTQAnimalKingdom,I don't have a problem with that

18-12-2021T18:15:02,hyneria,what would be the worst crack ship for Raine? Raine x Mike?

18-12-2021T18:15:15,Roughlandin,Raine and Mike would never work

18-12-2021T18:15:50,KaplanSektyPieczarek,Sythe x Red works only if one of this condions are true: Red is female or Red is a female wolf
18-12-2021T18:15:51,LGBTQAnimalKingdom,Well... she does have the wolf side soooo
18-12-2021T18:15:56,SpaceCadety,Raine x Kat.  Pair the bookworms.

18-12-2021T18:17:24,KaplanSektyPieczarek,Imagine this @Roughlandin: Kat split into two (Dogkat and Catkat). Evals x Dogkat and Mike x Catkat
18-12-2021T18:17:25,Ordithus,The only appropriate Clovis ship is brick x his face
