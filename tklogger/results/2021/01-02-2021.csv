01-02-2021T00:00:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I hear that‚Äôs illegal
01-02-2021T00:01:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"although with some of the stories I‚Äôve heard between brothers, I wonder if there‚Äôs leeway somewhere in that rule"
01-02-2021T00:03:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I heard hercules but what about brother bear
01-02-2021T00:07:57,CrRAR,Anything with Rick Moranis is just great
01-02-2021T00:08:04,CrRAR,(he's the moose)
01-02-2021T00:08:37,CrRAR,got tea also in the meantime
01-02-2021T00:09:08,CrRAR,I've watched Brother Bear I think once total
01-02-2021T00:09:20,CrRAR,Did that come out around the same time as Tarzan?
01-02-2021T00:10:09,CrRAR,"eh, pretty close"
01-02-2021T00:10:48,CrRAR,(eh)
01-02-2021T00:10:54,CrRAR,hehe
01-02-2021T00:11:47,CrRAR,it was I think one of Moranis' last gigs before taking an acting break I remember
01-02-2021T00:12:30,CrRAR,It's weird I feel like when it came out I didn't associate it w/ Disney
01-02-2021T00:12:54,CrRAR,even Tarzan seemed a bit off-beat
01-02-2021T00:13:11,CrRAR,"style wise, both were good movies"

01-02-2021T15:04:51,CrRAR,yeah android can do that
01-02-2021T15:04:54,SpazztasticKiwi,so I haven‚Äôt seen if they have that option
01-02-2021T15:05:14,SpazztasticKiwi,with any app
01-02-2021T15:05:41,CrRAR,...maybe? I‚Äôd have to check
01-02-2021T15:06:01,CrRAR,I know they‚Äôve added more and more individual controls on apps
01-02-2021T15:06:17,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs individual for each app
01-02-2021T15:06:26,CrRAR,cool
01-02-2021T15:06:40,CrRAR,makes sense with so many options out there nowadays
01-02-2021T15:06:43,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
01-02-2021T15:06:49,CrRAR,nite terra
01-02-2021T15:06:53,SpazztasticKiwi,you can hide the message if you‚Äôre phones locked or let it show as a preview when it‚Äôs locked
01-02-2021T15:07:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"if it‚Äôs unlocked, it shows by default"
01-02-2021T15:07:19,CrRAR,Yeah I know globably it can be supressed but not invisible
01-02-2021T15:07:29,CrRAR,or fully visible
01-02-2021T15:07:32,CrRAR,or off
01-02-2021T15:08:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"but if anyone tries to open the message, preview open or hidden when the phones locked, it‚Äôll ask for the password"
01-02-2021T15:08:08,CrRAR,yup
01-02-2021T15:08:29,SpazztasticKiwi,and pictures show as ‚Äúimage sent‚Äù
01-02-2021T15:09:00,SpazztasticKiwi,nobody can see what they sent unless you open it & they look over your shoulder
01-02-2021T15:09:29,CrRAR,:iphone::telescope::chipmunk:
01-02-2021T15:10:00,CrRAR,yeah if you supress visibility all content is excluded
01-02-2021T15:10:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"it‚Äôs a good way to forget that you saw their response but because you didn‚Äôt actually open it, they don‚Äôt know you saw & can be waiting for your answer or to see it before saying more"
01-02-2021T15:11:15,CrRAR,"yeah, esp w/ a lot of stuff, people miss texts and whatnot sometimes during busy times as it is"
01-02-2021T15:11:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I figured texts do that but I haven‚Äôt seen if android does that with messenger
01-02-2021T15:11:54,AspiringNoodle,I like text <3
01-02-2021T15:12:11,NinoGD,hi noodle
01-02-2021T15:12:17,AspiringNoodle,You aren't as on the spot with it.  Calls are just instant pressure
01-02-2021T15:12:19,AspiringNoodle,Hi Nino <3
01-02-2021T15:12:49,CrRAR,I know its purpose is to make anything that pops up unidentifiable
01-02-2021T15:13:11,CrRAR,I‚Äôm sure the devs of the apps want to utilize the feature
01-02-2021T15:13:37,CrRAR,"by now hopefully all have made it compatible, if that is even req‚Äôd on their end"
01-02-2021T15:14:16,CrRAR,I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the OS just does the cleansing/omission and pops a notification
01-02-2021T15:19:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I never mentioned calls
01-02-2021T15:36:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I can text someone to death once I get going tho
01-02-2021T15:40:46,CrRAR,what a way to go lol

01-02-2021T15:46:23,CrRAR,I kinda want sweet potato fries now
01-02-2021T15:46:33,CrRAR,or like cajun fries
01-02-2021T15:46:43,CrimsonQuill,Oh thanks. Now I want them too.
01-02-2021T15:46:49,CrimsonQuill,And I only had dinner two hours ago.
01-02-2021T15:47:00,CrRAR,my apologies
01-02-2021T15:47:05,CrRAR,haha
01-02-2021T15:47:09,CrRAR,"did you have plain fries earlier, spazz?"
01-02-2021T15:48:14,CrimsonQuill,I've just seen the sketch suggestion note...is it too late for a snow-themed suggestion? 'Cause I've been running one of those the past few months
01-02-2021T15:48:32,CrRAR,Probably not
01-02-2021T15:48:39,CrimsonQuill,Awww
01-02-2021T15:48:47,CrimsonQuill,Great
01-02-2021T15:48:52,CrimsonQuill,I'll try it this week

01-02-2021T16:00:17,AspiringNoodle,We were using the snow blower to clear off the street in front of our house.
01-02-2021T16:00:32,CrimsonQuill,Ah.
01-02-2021T16:02:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I missed out on ten minutes after I was last here
01-02-2021T16:16:10,AspiringNoodle,"But yeah, when I speak, I tend to be very clear with what I'm talking about."
01-02-2021T16:16:34,AspiringNoodle,I make a statement about my hands being tired / cramped because the handles that deliver power to the snowblower take a lot of pressure to hold down
01-02-2021T16:17:00,AspiringNoodle,But apparently that's because I was doing more work than I needed to in order to move the whole machine when that would be more of a full-body tiredness complaint???
