14-02-2021T00:00:15,Roughlandin,A couple people have been banned before
14-02-2021T00:00:55,Roughlandin,"Heck I think you nearly kicked me in like my first week on stream, Ord"
14-02-2021T00:00:56,AspiringNoodle,"iirc, weren't prose and fomo temp banned?"
14-02-2021T00:01:13,Roughlandin,"Prose and FoMo both got banned by Tom for like a day each, yeah"
14-02-2021T00:01:15,Ordithus,oh I get you now. it's late and I barely slept last night in my defense
14-02-2021T00:03:00,Roughlandin,"Who were you thinking of, Ord?"
14-02-2021T00:03:22,Ordithus,already done
14-02-2021T00:03:36,Roughlandin,Ah okay. Don't mean to pry
14-02-2021T00:03:49,SpazztasticKiwi,wat

14-02-2021T00:04:39,Ordithus,wat wat tiger butt :ctwokinds-FloDance:
14-02-2021T00:05:04,Roughlandin,Trace is a lucky boy this V-day
14-02-2021T00:05:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I get the temp ban thing & those who have been before but it looks like there was a sentence I missed in the middle there
14-02-2021T00:06:16,SpazztasticKiwi,fomo for one is taking residency on my sht list personally
14-02-2021T00:06:25,Roughlandin,I'm assuming there was an issue with somebody and Ord doesn't want to name names *Shrugs.*
14-02-2021T00:06:41,SpazztasticKiwi,noooooow I got it
14-02-2021T00:07:04,SpazztasticKiwi,& I have an idea but it’s no concern
14-02-2021T00:07:29,Roughlandin,I just stay in my corner and try not to get banned myself lol
14-02-2021T00:07:46,Roughlandin,"Like I said, I think Ord nearly kicked or banned me in my first week on chat"
14-02-2021T00:08:00,SpazztasticKiwi,the chuckleheads you find in this fandom sometimes
14-02-2021T00:08:12,Ordithus,I have no memory of this and can neither confirm nor deny
14-02-2021T00:08:23,SpazztasticKiwi,this isn’t court
14-02-2021T00:08:25,Roughlandin,I think I was capslock spamming
14-02-2021T00:08:40,SpazztasticKiwi,there was some of that this stream
14-02-2021T00:08:40,Ordithus,I'm just here to enjoy art
14-02-2021T00:08:52,KeefMcDerpface,same
14-02-2021T00:08:53,Roughlandin,People get excited
14-02-2021T00:09:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I was in and out for the most part too tho
14-02-2021T00:09:03,KeefMcDerpface,"Too excited, even."
14-02-2021T00:09:06,Roughlandin,"Still, sometimes folks can go... overboard"
14-02-2021T00:09:16,SpazztasticKiwi,way too excited for some of them
14-02-2021T00:09:35,Roughlandin,And a touch too... graphic with their... excitement
14-02-2021T00:10:20,SpazztasticKiwi,watching is nice though
14-02-2021T00:10:34,SpazztasticKiwi,you get a good feel for who you’d avoid physo
14-02-2021T00:10:38,SpazztasticKiwi,physically
14-02-2021T00:10:42,Roughlandin,But eh. This is kind of a fringe fandom. It's bound to attract some people who aren't the most... socially well adjusted
14-02-2021T00:11:01,Roughlandin,"And yeah, usually I can tell whether or not somebody is gonna make it through their first few days to become a regular"
14-02-2021T00:11:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I watch more in the sense of who I’d consider safe
14-02-2021T00:11:33,NinoGD,yeah
14-02-2021T00:11:37,Roughlandin,Yeaaaaah
14-02-2021T00:11:38,SpazztasticKiwi,not only as a person but as a woman
14-02-2021T00:11:40,Roughlandin,There's that too
14-02-2021T00:11:58,SpazztasticKiwi,some of these folks have no self control
14-02-2021T00:12:01,Roughlandin,Thankfully they usually get themselves sorted out too
14-02-2021T00:12:49,Roughlandin,Or they fall off the bus eventually (remembers Moppy and shudders.)
14-02-2021T00:12:53,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s sometimes little things that get you on a girls “avoid” list
14-02-2021T00:13:34,Roughlandin,And sometimes just generally being a creep
14-02-2021T00:13:39,SpazztasticKiwi,like the guy who visited the deli and said “you were at little cesars last week; I watched you”
14-02-2021T00:13:46,Roughlandin,Uuuuuuuh
14-02-2021T00:13:49,Roughlandin,Bye
14-02-2021T00:14:02,KeefMcDerpface,NOPE!
14-02-2021T00:14:09,SpazztasticKiwi,phrasing is important
14-02-2021T00:14:20,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:
14-02-2021T00:14:28,Roughlandin,"""saw"" might have been a better word choice"
14-02-2021T00:14:35,SpazztasticKiwi,sure I vaguely recognized him but bro
14-02-2021T00:14:40,Roughlandin,"Still, a little blunt there bud"
14-02-2021T00:15:27,SpazztasticKiwi,told me how he saw my red suv - it’s more maroon but still
14-02-2021T00:15:42,Roughlandin,Don't correct him
14-02-2021T00:15:51,Roughlandin,"""Actually it was blue."""
14-02-2021T00:15:56,SpazztasticKiwi,this is not how you introduce yourself to a stranger you saw only one other time
14-02-2021T00:16:31,Roughlandin,"Try, ""Hi! I think I've run into you somewhere before. NOT IN A CREEPY WAY!"""
14-02-2021T00:16:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not sure what expression was on my face but his friend was like “ignore him he’s weird”
14-02-2021T00:16:56,Roughlandin,"Thank you, friend"
14-02-2021T00:17:04,KeefMcDerpface,What a good pal.
14-02-2021T00:17:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I really don’t think he meant to be so odd
14-02-2021T00:17:16,Roughlandin,Sometimes words just come out bad
14-02-2021T00:17:24,SpazztasticKiwi,not a good ice breaker
14-02-2021T00:18:28,SpazztasticKiwi,he was perfectly polite and all it’s just the “hey I saw you last week and now I’m at your job with knowledge of what you drive”
14-02-2021T00:18:30,Roughlandin,"But yeah. In every fandom there are some real creepo's. In furry fanservice patreons, especially"
14-02-2021T00:18:50,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s weirdos in all fandoms
14-02-2021T00:19:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"there’s folks in general that don’t have social skills, sometimes no skills at all"
14-02-2021T00:19:35,Roughlandin,I can't stand the guys who whine at Tom because his art isn't explicit enough for their tastes
14-02-2021T00:19:58,Roughlandin,"Like, welcome to the internet. There are many other people who make explicit art if you want it"
14-02-2021T00:20:14,KeefMcDerpface,Just not here.
14-02-2021T00:20:58,Roughlandin,And that's fine. Tom's a person. It's his art. He can do what he wants with it
14-02-2021T00:21:38,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s usually the folks who can’t get a girl to talk to them or stand being around them
14-02-2021T00:21:48,SpazztasticKiwi,or like things that aren’t very normal
14-02-2021T00:22:06,Roughlandin,It's usually the people who aren't very socially adjusted to begin with
14-02-2021T00:22:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I know somebody who could qualify - I’ve mentioned him before
14-02-2021T00:23:13,Roughlandin,Personally or here in chat?
14-02-2021T00:23:26,Roughlandin,No need to name names either way
14-02-2021T00:23:35,Dadrobit,"Oh man, that"
14-02-2021T00:23:51,Dadrobit,"""I saw your car at X"" kinda hits close."
14-02-2021T00:24:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I know this guy personally rough
14-02-2021T00:24:09,Dadrobit,I memorize a lot of license plates/cars just as a function of my job.
14-02-2021T00:24:14,Roughlandin,"Ah got it, kiwi"
14-02-2021T00:24:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t know the extent of what the drug problems did to him but they obviously did something because I’ve noticed he’s not normal socially in some instances
14-02-2021T00:24:38,Roughlandin,Oh yeah I remember this guy now
14-02-2021T00:24:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"like, he can have a moment or respond in a way that makes you ??"
14-02-2021T00:24:56,Roughlandin,Drugs are no good
14-02-2021T00:25:02,SpazztasticKiwi,yet not stupid either
14-02-2021T00:25:07,SpazztasticKiwi,just odd on occasion
14-02-2021T00:25:07,Dadrobit,"But I'll see them around the city, and it's hard not to mention whenever I'm engaging in small talk with them later."
14-02-2021T00:25:29,Roughlandin,"I can sympathize, dad"
14-02-2021T00:25:31,Ordithus,[I know where you live]*:cw0lfmare-Paperflora:
14-02-2021T00:25:35,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-VivianPanic:
14-02-2021T00:25:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"yeah but imagine a guy neither you or your sister knows, dadro, and he says that to her"
14-02-2021T00:26:30,Roughlandin,"It was weird working in a pharmacy one day and seeing a guy ask us not to tell his wife about his viagra, and then seeing him with his family on the street later that week"
14-02-2021T00:26:46,SpazztasticKiwi,“don’t look em in the eye”
14-02-2021T00:27:01,Roughlandin,Les Mis reference?
14-02-2021T00:27:11,SpazztasticKiwi,never seen
14-02-2021T00:27:20,Dadrobit,"Rough, that's called HIPPA"
14-02-2021T00:27:27,Roughlandin,Ah ignore me. I'm a theater kid. Everything is a Les Mis reference
14-02-2021T00:27:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I was in theatre too
14-02-2021T00:27:50,Dadrobit,You're legally obligated to not say shit.
14-02-2021T00:28:17,Roughlandin,And yeah it is HIPAA. Which is what I told him every time. And he still made weird creepy old man jokes about it every time
14-02-2021T00:28:26,Dadrobit,"I'm just like, oh, yeah, I remember seeing your Porche at the Fashion Square the other day."
14-02-2021T00:29:11,SpazztasticKiwi,ok no https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/810736111923101746/image0.png
14-02-2021T00:29:19,SpazztasticKiwi,but also why
14-02-2021T00:29:27,NinoGD,wth
14-02-2021T00:29:34,Roughlandin,"There was another old guy who used to come in and call one of my pharmacists who was from Cairo ""Ramses"" and ask him if he had a second wife yet"
14-02-2021T00:29:45,KeefMcDerpface,Wat?!
14-02-2021T00:29:53,Roughlandin,I... wat.
14-02-2021T00:29:56,Dadrobit,And it has elastics at the bottom?
14-02-2021T00:30:06,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-zenshocked: whaaaa
14-02-2021T00:30:18,Roughlandin,That's not how you pants!
14-02-2021T00:30:25,KeefMcDerpface,Who would wear that?!
14-02-2021T00:30:30,SpazztasticKiwi,somebody show wolf
14-02-2021T00:30:35,KeefMcDerpface,haha
14-02-2021T00:30:46,Roughlandin,He'd have an aneurism
14-02-2021T00:31:06,SpazztasticKiwi,it looks like an arrestable offence
14-02-2021T00:31:31,Roughlandin,I mean it's technically clothes
14-02-2021T00:31:32,Dadrobit,Depends on the area.
14-02-2021T00:31:44,Dadrobit,"If I wore those in Tucson, I'd definitely get arrested."
14-02-2021T00:31:49,SpazztasticKiwi,https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/808836701719887942/image0.jpg
14-02-2021T00:32:03,Roughlandin,How do you keep the legs from falling down?
14-02-2021T00:32:03,Ordithus,but not in Phoenix?
14-02-2021T00:32:36,Dadrobit,"Probably not. Tucson has some ass backwards ""Decency"" laws."
14-02-2021T00:32:39,Roughlandin,*Chews donut quieter.*
14-02-2021T00:33:00,Roughlandin,It's illegal to carry an ice cream cone in your back pocket in Kentucky
14-02-2021T00:33:03,Ordithus,can't say I've run into that
14-02-2021T00:33:30,Dadrobit,Like wearing clothes of the opposite gender is outright illegal.
14-02-2021T00:33:40,Roughlandin,That's fucky
14-02-2021T00:34:06,Roughlandin,"Fricking mind yo business, law"
14-02-2021T00:35:01,Roughlandin,"Who determines what gender clothes are, anyway?"
14-02-2021T00:35:09,Roughlandin,So can girls not wear pants?
14-02-2021T00:36:15,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-laura: no pants
14-02-2021T00:36:17,SpazztasticKiwi,according to history skirts and heels were originally for men
14-02-2021T00:36:24,SpazztasticKiwi,as were tights
14-02-2021T00:37:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"anatomically, pants make more sense for women and dresses n skirts for men"
14-02-2021T00:37:01,Roughlandin,"Kiwi, that guy you were talking about: https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugwl4qFXeSAdVYEvUex4AaABCQ"
14-02-2021T00:37:16,Roughlandin,Yeah! I wanna wear a kilt!
14-02-2021T00:37:21,SpazztasticKiwi,a blank page
14-02-2021T00:37:26,Ordithus,pants were because of horse riding
14-02-2021T00:37:35,KeefMcDerpface,"Oh gosh, Rough..."
14-02-2021T00:37:44,Roughlandin,Huh why are you not getting youtube links...
14-02-2021T00:38:12,KeefMcDerpface,Community Posts don't work I believe.
14-02-2021T00:38:15,Roughlandin,Weird
14-02-2021T00:39:34,Roughlandin,"That's why you can't carry an ice cream cone in your back pocket in Kentucky, Ord. Horse theft."
14-02-2021T00:40:20,Roughlandin,No pants. No pockets. No horse theft. *Big Brain Rough.*
14-02-2021T00:40:39,Dadrobit,I imagine the ice cream cone is so that people don't accidentally sit on them and make a mess of public sitting areas.
14-02-2021T00:40:51,Dadrobit,Atttracting ants and making things sticky
14-02-2021T00:41:39,KeefMcDerpface,"ew, It's like gum but worst."
14-02-2021T00:42:10,Roughlandin,No it's literally because of horse theft. People would carry a cone in their back pocket. Horses would follow them to get the sweet treat.
14-02-2021T00:42:22,Roughlandin,"""I'm not stealing the horse! It's just following me!"""
14-02-2021T00:42:34,KeefMcDerpface,Odd.
14-02-2021T00:43:24,Roughlandin,In Indiana it's illegal to own ninja stars
14-02-2021T00:43:26,Dadrobit,huh
14-02-2021T00:44:00,KeefMcDerpface,Are we naming off weird laws now?
14-02-2021T00:44:26,Roughlandin,Idk I'm just being random lol
14-02-2021T00:45:31,KeefMcDerpface,"Probably best we don't dig too deep, there's some pretty weird ones."
14-02-2021T00:46:06,Roughlandin,Yeaah. Didn't one State only just recently illegalize slavery?
14-02-2021T00:47:17,Roughlandin,Yep. Mississippi only ratified the 13th Amendment in 2013. Yeesh.
14-02-2021T00:47:39,Dadrobit,And Utah and Nebraska finally removed the prison exemption this year
14-02-2021T00:47:59,Dadrobit,"Previously, it was legal to use prisoners as slaves"
14-02-2021T00:48:16,Dadrobit,Welcome to the 20th century folks
14-02-2021T00:48:18,Roughlandin,Ew
14-02-2021T00:49:39,Roughlandin,US law is a nightmare. I'm glad I never went into law school...
14-02-2021T00:50:11,KeefMcDerpface,"Ooh, Ooh, there's one state where it's legal to fire off a firework every mile to scare off wild life or something."
14-02-2021T00:51:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m alabama it’s illegal to fight a bear blindfolded
14-02-2021T00:51:33,Roughlandin,Guess I'm moving to Alabama
14-02-2021T00:51:50,Roughlandin,No more crazy blindfolded humans trying to fight me
14-02-2021T00:51:57,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s either fight or wrestle
14-02-2021T00:52:03,Roughlandin,Either way
14-02-2021T00:52:28,SpazztasticKiwi,imagine the idiot that’ll do it normally
14-02-2021T00:52:30,Ordithus,"a couple years ago a black bear went downtown, hung out in a tree during the day"
14-02-2021T00:52:42,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s got to be a law against doing it blindfolded
14-02-2021T00:53:04,Roughlandin,Good thing I have my right to bear arms

14-02-2021T00:55:30,Roughlandin,Oh sweet! *Starts packing.*
14-02-2021T00:55:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m a kiwi and they let me in
