27-02-2021T18:57:24,iliar,"@Twokinds, I have a question. Is Ivy a canon character? I mean, in the comic, Flora mentioned that she has a sister. But is Ivy exactly her canonical sister?"
27-02-2021T18:57:26,iliar,Or is it just a fantasy for the patrons? Is it the same as it was with Flora's mom?
27-02-2021T18:57:58,ProsePro7,I think it counts I mean she had a mother and a sister
27-02-2021T18:58:06,ProsePro7,But Tom is the authority
27-02-2021T18:58:12,unsteddyphoenix,Nice woooork!

27-02-2021T23:27:35,Jeebuus,I was getting alternator noise through my speakers after having an amp installed so I was trying to find the culprit.
27-02-2021T23:27:49,Jeebuus,Couldn't.
27-02-2021T23:27:49,Lunarsprint,"never did audio, did residential commercial and  bird brooders though soldering sucks"
27-02-2021T23:27:55,Jeebuus,Caved in and bought a ground filter.
