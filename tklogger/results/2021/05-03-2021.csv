05-03-2021T16:00:30,AspiringNoodle,Almost every single major scifi film / series has rear thrusters and rear thrusters ONLY
05-03-2021T16:00:41,AspiringNoodle,That... that's not how space works...
05-03-2021T16:00:52,Ordithus,"Yeah, a lot of scifi treats space flight the same as flight in air"
05-03-2021T16:00:59,AspiringNoodle,^^^^
05-03-2021T16:01:13,Ordithus,It's really cool when these details are added in
05-03-2021T16:01:16,AspiringNoodle,space :clap: is :clap: a :clap: vacuum :clap:
05-03-2021T16:01:35,SageSaga,you just make special wings that can press against a vacuum to provide friction to rotate and spin!

05-03-2021T16:01:54,AspiringNoodle,:newspaper2::newspaper2::newspaper2:
05-03-2021T16:02:29,AspiringNoodle,"I do wonder what actual spacecraft will be like, though"
05-03-2021T16:02:49,AspiringNoodle,"Yes, we have space shuttles, but those are designed specifically with re-entering the atmosphere in mind"
05-03-2021T16:03:22,AspiringNoodle,"What if we want spacecraft not only capable of operating in space, but being able to shift to flight in the atmosphere?"
05-03-2021T16:03:34,SageSaga,so long as they are efficient and structurally sound we can make em look like anytthing-
05-03-2021T16:03:47,Ordithus,remember the lunar lander?
05-03-2021T16:04:02,AspiringNoodle,"On that note, what would fighter craft look like if they're primarily designed for combat?"
05-03-2021T16:04:12,AspiringNoodle,And the Lunar Lander is also more purpose built :P
05-03-2021T16:04:34,AspiringNoodle,Though it does seem to be the closest we've gotten to a generalist spacecraft design.
05-03-2021T16:04:56,SageSaga,future space flight is gonna be boring in terms of design because just about everything would probably be best as a sphere XD
05-03-2021T16:05:10,AspiringNoodle,"Or a rod, lol"
05-03-2021T16:05:17,SageSaga,the Sayians got it right
05-03-2021T16:05:34,AspiringNoodle,Interstellar probably has the most realistic spacecraft design I've seen.
05-03-2021T16:05:39,AspiringNoodle,"err, correction"
05-03-2021T16:05:44,AspiringNoodle,"Passengers, mixed up my films xD"
05-03-2021T16:06:09,AspiringNoodle,That said... space is SCARY.
05-03-2021T16:06:29,AspiringNoodle,You could have rocks or other debris flying through at a fraction of the speed of light
05-03-2021T16:07:00,Ordithus,fortunately for that space is very low density.
05-03-2021T16:07:12,Ordithus,even the asteroid belt is pretty much just empty space
05-03-2021T16:07:18,AspiringNoodle,"You'd never see them coming, and you probably couldn't react in time.  How do you protect against something like that, or prepare a ship in the event that one of these things rips a hole clear through the ship."
05-03-2021T16:07:20,sunblaze,thats right you want to invate earth with a GIANT army of spaceships? good luck getting to us in one piece!
05-03-2021T16:08:00,AspiringNoodle,I should see what the science behind that shield in Passengers was
05-03-2021T16:08:26,AspiringNoodle,"You know, that energy field design specifically to deflect / destroy oncoming rocks to protect the ship?  But one still got through and was the catalyst for the plot? xD"
05-03-2021T16:14:58,Ordithus,I have not seen that movie
05-03-2021T16:16:58,AspiringNoodle,"If you like Chris Pratt / Jennifer Lawrence, they both have a fantastic performance."

05-03-2021T16:17:08,SageSaga,it turned out to be made by ACME
05-03-2021T16:17:12,AspiringNoodle,Even Laurence Fishburne is in it :D
05-03-2021T16:17:33,Ordithus,oooh nice
05-03-2021T16:17:45,SageSaga,didnt that movie bomb?
05-03-2021T16:17:59,Ordithus,been a bit since I watched scifi. Star Wars... is scifi adjacent
05-03-2021T16:18:10,AspiringNoodle,"Says the budget was $101M - $150M, made $303M at the box office"
05-03-2021T16:18:34,SageSaga,oof it has a 30% on RT and 41 on metacritic
05-03-2021T16:18:40,Ordithus,ouch
05-03-2021T16:19:08,AspiringNoodle,Those are the critic scores
05-03-2021T16:19:15,AspiringNoodle,"on RT, the audience score is 63%"
05-03-2021T16:19:35,AspiringNoodle,And 6.8 on meta
05-03-2021T16:19:46,sunblaze,so its kinda unrealistic and silly but entertaining?
05-03-2021T16:19:59,AspiringNoodle,"It's a crowd pleaser, at the very least"
05-03-2021T16:20:08,AspiringNoodle,"Maybe not the best, but odds are good that you will enjoy watching it"
05-03-2021T16:20:34,AspiringNoodle,"Tbh, over time there's become a bit of a disconnect between critics and audiences."
05-03-2021T16:21:07,AspiringNoodle,"Not saying there aren't films that are universally loved by critics and audiences, but it's becoming more and more common for there to be films that critics love, and audiences hate, and vice-versa."
05-03-2021T16:21:50,Ordithus,critics are a lot more critical. it's like it is in the name
05-03-2021T16:21:58,AspiringNoodle,"Ord, did you want a rough plot synopsys?"
05-03-2021T16:22:03,AspiringNoodle,synopsis*
05-03-2021T16:22:05,Ordithus,"nah, I can look it up"
05-03-2021T16:22:07,Ordithus,or watch it
05-03-2021T16:22:31,AspiringNoodle,I'm not saying that critics aren't critical.  I'm saying that what critics like and what audiences like has diverged.
05-03-2021T16:23:06,AspiringNoodle,Rotten Tomatoes - The Witch: https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_witch_2016
05-03-2021T16:23:10,Ordithus,"7/10 is a pretty meh audience score. not bad, but not great"
05-03-2021T16:23:16,SageSaga,seems people liked the actors but felt the plot was flawed
05-03-2021T16:23:24,AspiringNoodle,Pretty much
05-03-2021T16:23:34,AspiringNoodle,But it was interesting to watch people lose it in spaaaaaaaaaaace
05-03-2021T16:23:41,Ordithus,"but if it's got good visuals and is a harder scifi, can be worth a watch for that"
05-03-2021T16:24:11,AspiringNoodle,"So, The Witch is one of those films where I mention a bit of a disconnect"
05-03-2021T16:24:20,AspiringNoodle,"90% approval by critics, but 59% by audiences"
05-03-2021T16:24:54,sunblaze,that audience must have been drunk. that was incredibly good that movie!
05-03-2021T16:26:31,SageSaga,saw one guy who said Monster Hunter was the best movie he saw from 2020
05-03-2021T16:27:03,SageSaga,and it wasnt the only movie he saw
05-03-2021T16:27:32,AspiringNoodle,"I haven't watched The Witch yet.  I want to, but I either forget or just straight up miss it."
05-03-2021T16:28:07,AspiringNoodle,"If critics love a film, I go into it to experience a work of art :)"
05-03-2021T16:28:15,sunblaze,definetly do it in one run. the movie looses its athmosphere if you take extended breaks
05-03-2021T16:29:30,Ordithus,"I just wish more of these movies were on netflix, or free with prime..."

05-03-2021T16:42:46,SpazztasticKiwi,dr says it looks like a bad acne flare
05-03-2021T16:42:58,SpazztasticKiwi,in summary I panicked
05-03-2021T16:44:43,Ordithus,was the panic before or after seeing the doctor?
05-03-2021T16:44:44,SageSaga,better to overreact than under react about a sudden unusual medical issue when you start taking a new drug
05-03-2021T16:45:37,SpazztasticKiwi,before
05-03-2021T16:46:05,SpazztasticKiwi,still not happy though
05-03-2021T16:47:09,SpazztasticKiwi,possibly means more scarring later
05-03-2021T16:47:14,SpazztasticKiwi,like I need more
05-03-2021T16:47:36,Ordithus,not fun.

05-03-2021T18:16:53,JeremySenpai,have you abandoned Rem then? Like she has been abandoned in the current series
