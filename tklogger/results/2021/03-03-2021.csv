03-03-2021T14:41:42,CrimsonQuill086,I've seen the colour of 'The mother' and the description.
03-03-2021T14:41:46,CrimsonQuill086,She's horrifying.
03-03-2021T14:42:33,CrRAR,"She doesn‚Äôt wish for you SPECIFICALLY to die, just generally."
03-03-2021T14:42:51,CrRAR,you know
03-03-2021T14:42:58,CrRAR,whenever you feel like it
03-03-2021T14:43:31,CrimsonQuill086,"That is even worse though, in my eyes. She sees it as more 'merciful' for people to die in accidents in her forest...and then literally devours their souls."
03-03-2021T14:43:50,CrimsonQuill086,What's worse is that her line of thought is reminiscent of many real-world fears.
03-03-2021T14:44:13,CrimsonQuill086,"We always fear death...but in her fear, she has trapped herself in a cage of her own making."
03-03-2021T14:44:22,CrimsonQuill086,She no longer lives...she just...exists.
03-03-2021T14:44:31,CrRAR,Well that death is a far better conclusion than lost and/or suffering
03-03-2021T14:44:38,CrimsonQuill086,"A leech, feeding off the souls of the fallen in the forest..."
03-03-2021T14:44:44,CrRAR,gentle acceptance~

03-03-2021T14:44:59,CrimsonQuill086,"And yet, in her own web, she has entangled herself!"
03-03-2021T14:45:20,CrimsonQuill086,"Like Ungoliant of the Silmarillion, her hunger ever increases. She doesn't even realize she is trapped."
03-03-2021T14:46:17,CrimsonQuill086,"I find her repulsive, and perhaps unforgivable...and yet, in a twisted way, I can't help but pity her, for her fear of death has led to it-would you really consider such a pitiful existence life?"
03-03-2021T14:56:02,CrimsonQuill086,"I do, in a way pity the mother. But I fear that she is too far gone..."
03-03-2021T14:56:11,CrimsonQuill086,Then again...there is always hope for change.

03-03-2021T19:55:22,CrRAR,cheap
03-03-2021T19:55:47,CrRAR,dealers naturally wanted to replace the whole tank

03-03-2021T20:06:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I once found my arm is small enough to reach in the car hood and get to this bolt that kept some tube attached
03-03-2021T20:06:49,Ordithus,because I worked on it :cw0lfmare-PaperemberClose:
03-03-2021T20:06:49,SpazztasticKiwi,we ended up still having to take it to the shop to get the last bolt off because I couldn‚Äôt get the angle + oomph needed to get it off
03-03-2021T20:07:39,SpazztasticKiwi,but I had to get on the car to reach inside because bending over into the car guys wasn‚Äôt an option for an suv at 5‚Äô5
03-03-2021T20:07:50,SpazztasticKiwi,guts
03-03-2021T20:08:26,Ordithus,some things are in the hardest to reach places

03-03-2021T20:15:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"we still have people not wearing it over their nose, taking it off to talk or sneeze, and even slipping it off to talk to friends IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WALKWAY, like inches from each other"
03-03-2021T20:16:01,Ordithus,that's anywhere
03-03-2021T20:16:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"yes, block traffic for your reunion - there aren‚Äôt other people trying to shop as fast as possible so they‚Äôre not exposed any more than possible"
03-03-2021T20:16:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I take mine off at lunch hour because I‚Äôve been wearing it all day & ill be eating once I have what I pick out that day
03-03-2021T20:17:00,Dadrobit,"Shit, I go to the store and it's a coinflip whether or not they have masks at all."
03-03-2021T20:17:07,CrRAR,"Oh yeah some spark plugs on a transverse engine you have to undo a mount bolt or two and tilt the engine, ord."
03-03-2021T20:17:29,SpazztasticKiwi,oh it‚Äôs the same here - even better are those that come in with masks only on them or only on their kids
03-03-2021T20:18:26,Ordithus,"in this case it was come up from underneath, reach around the transmission and exhaust, and feel my way, crrar"

03-03-2021T20:22:22,Dadrobit,"Christ, I read that as ""Flaky, Crumbly, Sweaty Pastry"" and was very concerned for a sec."

03-03-2021T20:46:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"we‚Äôve only gotten over a pandemic, what‚Äôs the worse that could happen"
03-03-2021T20:46:25,SonOfGoku,WW3?
03-03-2021T20:47:33,CrRAR,you know we‚Äôd lose a few members by the end of the trip right?
03-03-2021T20:48:13,Ordithus,for the greater good
03-03-2021T20:48:21,SonOfGoku,It would be like modern day Oregon trails
03-03-2021T20:48:25,CrRAR,xD
03-03-2021T20:49:46,SpazztasticKiwi,you mean we‚Äôd lose THE WEAK
03-03-2021T20:52:05,CrRAR,Deciding on food venue: impossible
03-03-2021T20:52:28,CrRAR,*eight drive-thru visits later*
03-03-2021T20:52:36,CrRAR,"‚Äúguys, we‚Äôre out of gas‚Äù"
03-03-2021T20:54:44,SpazztasticKiwi,yall can get whatever you want
03-03-2021T20:54:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll eat before
03-03-2021T20:55:36,CrRAR,spazz just always automatically has a bag of something delicious
03-03-2021T20:55:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"game changer: choose a sit in restaurant, everyone can get almost anything they were wanting"
03-03-2021T20:55:57,CrRAR,everyone: ‚ÄúWhere does she keep GETTING THESE THINGS!?‚Äù
03-03-2021T20:56:14,SpazztasticKiwi,women: we grow up without access to pockets in most of our clothes unless we shop outside the department
03-03-2021T20:56:15,CrRAR,*stomach grumbles everwhere*
03-03-2021T20:56:25,CrRAR,haha
03-03-2021T20:56:29,SpazztasticKiwi,we get sneaky & creative
03-03-2021T20:57:02,SonOfGoku,So the mystery deepens
03-03-2021T20:58:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"at any given time, I can have a mini first aid kit, a lady moment emergency bag, maybe single use straws and sporks, a nail kit, & hair brush/accessories as well as multiple pens"
03-03-2021T20:59:13,CrRAR,the spork is def advanced thinking
03-03-2021T20:59:53,SpazztasticKiwi,you can get delivery while out or drive thru and they forget your utensils in the bag

03-03-2021T21:29:35,SpazztasticKiwi,could still cheat tho
03-03-2021T21:41:18,CrRAR,"if ya click together, realizing how valuable having found each other is highly mature"
03-03-2021T21:41:41,CrRAR,...even if each... don't always act it... all the time
03-03-2021T21:57:13,SpazztasticKiwi,there is a reasonable risk that one day my boyfriend could come home and I attack him with a pillow
03-03-2021T21:57:17,SpazztasticKiwi,or water gun
03-03-2021T21:57:22,SpazztasticKiwi,so point
03-03-2021T21:58:52,CrRAR,nerf gun also acceptable
03-03-2021T21:59:15,CrRAR,*bonk*
03-03-2021T21:59:48,CrRAR,much good way to break workday vibes tbh

03-03-2021T22:14:40,SonOfGoku,"Be careful with those nerf guns, they can be modified to pack quite a punch"
03-03-2021T22:16:58,SonOfGoku,There's a point in which one may no longer be classified as a nerf gun
03-03-2021T22:35:40,SpazztasticKiwi,oh on top of the weight my face is breaking out again
03-03-2021T22:35:46,SpazztasticKiwi,so there‚Äôs that too
03-03-2021T22:38:59,CrRAR,"it'll clear up, tis temporary"
03-03-2021T22:43:58,SpazztasticKiwi,you obviously didn‚Äôt know what I looked like all through hs
03-03-2021T22:48:16,CrRAR,I was going to say anyone that says that crap ends after high school is full of it.
03-03-2021T22:48:27,CrRAR,sporadic torment
03-03-2021T22:51:00,CrRAR,"at least girls get the option of make up, guys... no where to run, no where to hide :notes:"
03-03-2021T22:56:30,Ordithus,:ptv-sleepy:
03-03-2021T22:59:37,SonOfGoku,Night Ord
03-03-2021T23:02:31,SpazztasticKiwi,makeup makes it worse
03-03-2021T23:02:37,SpazztasticKiwi,& I don‚Äôt wear it
03-03-2021T23:03:04,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs useless where I work & takes time to do & keep
03-03-2021T23:20:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"useless to wear it for anybody, given I have anybody to wear it for"
03-03-2021T23:51:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I can be ultra bitter
03-03-2021T23:51:44,SpazztasticKiwi,supra salty
03-03-2021T23:54:37,CrRAR,:owl:
03-03-2021T23:54:43,CrRAR,not to mention masks have made it pretty unnecessary
