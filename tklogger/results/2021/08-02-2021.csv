08-02-2021T00:00:48,SonOfGoku,What kind of hot chocolate do you usually make?
08-02-2021T00:01:07,CrRAR,uhh just milk chocolate I guess
08-02-2021T00:01:23,CrRAR,a good mint hot chocolate is the best tho
08-02-2021T00:01:51,CrRAR,need like a peppermint stick
08-02-2021T00:01:53,CrRAR,tho
08-02-2021T00:02:38,CrRAR,:thinking: I wonder if peppermint oil is available in the spices section at the supermarket
08-02-2021T00:02:53,SonOfGoku,I haven't had peppermint hot chocolate in over a year
08-02-2021T00:03:10,CrRAR,overdue

08-02-2021T00:03:49,CrRAR,if it is seems like the best way to do it
08-02-2021T00:04:05,CrRAR,almond extract in french toast is amazing
08-02-2021T00:04:15,CrRAR,just a few drops
08-02-2021T00:04:44,SonOfGoku,I recommend trying Nestle Abuelita hot chocolate
08-02-2021T00:04:59,CrRAR,I think I‚Äôve seen that
08-02-2021T00:05:09,CrRAR,is that slightly spicy?
08-02-2021T00:05:44,SonOfGoku,Not that I know of
08-02-2021T00:06:25,CrRAR,"ah, it‚Äôs got a bit of cinnamon in it"
08-02-2021T00:06:48,CrRAR,that sounds good
08-02-2021T00:07:18,CrRAR,"I can‚Äôt remember if I‚Äôve had it before, I think I remember the box in the cabinet"
08-02-2021T00:09:09,SonOfGoku,A yellow hexagonal box?
08-02-2021T00:09:33,CrRAR,i know it was yellow

08-02-2021T13:48:26,SonOfGoku,How was your day?
08-02-2021T13:50:59,CrimsonQuill086,It was good. I did a thing
08-02-2021T13:51:14,CrimsonQuill086,Drew some EOD spartans
08-02-2021T13:51:58,SonOfGoku,"Nice, traditional or digital drawings?"

08-02-2021T14:21:05,AspiringNoodle,I learned how to make animation in SFM :D
08-02-2021T14:21:34,CrRAR,oh cool
08-02-2021T14:21:58,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, SFM gonna spoil me xD"
08-02-2021T14:23:07,AspiringNoodle,"To confirm, Blender requires manual keyframes when doing animation."
08-02-2021T14:23:13,AspiringNoodle,And you need to make sure you select the right type.
08-02-2021T14:23:52,AspiringNoodle,"SFM, as long as you're in the timeline editor, as long as you manipulate a model, it will track any changes it needs to."

08-02-2021T14:26:47,SonOfGoku,Nice
08-02-2021T14:27:52,SonOfGoku,"I still need to figure out how to use my tablet, I've only done 3 different drawings with it in the past 3 years"
08-02-2021T14:29:31,NinoGD,oof
08-02-2021T14:29:59,AspiringNoodle,Less than a week
08-02-2021T14:30:15,AspiringNoodle,"I've been messing around in it off and on, seeing if I can replicate what another artist does"
08-02-2021T14:31:08,AspiringNoodle,"Interesting thing to note (specifically for things like tails / cables), if you select multiple points on the model, and try to rotate them all at once in SFM, if you're in the motion editor, it only rotates the root selection"
08-02-2021T14:31:31,AspiringNoodle,"But if you try rotating them in the timeline editor, it'll rotate all points at the same time for the same amount."

08-02-2021T19:25:34,SpazztasticKiwi,what olden days
08-02-2021T19:25:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm in my 20s
08-02-2021T19:25:53,CrRAR,"I still have two XP folders with the flashy fancy ""Genuine"" patterns on em!"
08-02-2021T19:25:57,CrRAR,like new!
08-02-2021T19:26:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs better to build than to buy but I‚Äôve yet to see proof of how it‚Äôs cheaper when people tell me that
08-02-2021T19:26:47,CrRAR,eh you get more for your money
08-02-2021T19:26:48,SpazztasticKiwi,$3000
08-02-2021T19:26:56,CrRAR,that was in 2005 xD
08-02-2021T19:27:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw a prebuilt for $500
08-02-2021T19:27:21,Twokinds,"Yeah PCs were waaay more expensive back then, too."
08-02-2021T19:27:29,Twokinds,PC building is way nicer these days.
08-02-2021T19:27:36,CrRAR,now you wouldn't spend more than like 1500 maybe
08-02-2021T19:27:39,CrRAR,1800 tops
08-02-2021T19:27:49,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúonly $1800‚Äù
08-02-2021T19:27:49,Twokinds,And it's all the graphics card XD
08-02-2021T19:27:57,CrRAR,yeah
08-02-2021T19:27:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"that, I know"
08-02-2021T19:28:09,Twokinds,https://imgur.com/a/RPIfG7R
08-02-2021T19:28:14,Twokinds,Here's my build.
08-02-2021T19:28:43,CrRAR,sweet!
08-02-2021T19:28:56,SpazztasticKiwi,building a bomb
08-02-2021T19:29:01,CrRAR,Corsair RAM is oddly very affordable these days
08-02-2021T19:29:02,Twokinds,Pretty basic stuff.
08-02-2021T19:29:12,CrRAR,it used to be the the top priced stuff
08-02-2021T19:29:18,CrRAR,it's still awsome though
08-02-2021T19:29:23,Twokinds,I can't believe how cheap m.2s are
08-02-2021T19:29:23,SpazztasticKiwi,ok maybe that‚Äôs extreme - I‚Äôve seen the parts before
08-02-2021T19:29:36,Twokinds,It was only a few years ago they were really high end
08-02-2021T19:29:42,CrRAR,yeah
08-02-2021T19:29:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Se√°n did a intro on the inside of his computer
08-02-2021T19:29:58,SpazztasticKiwi,it looked like that but shinier
08-02-2021T19:30:07,CrRAR,Manufacturers *removes case from SSD*
08-02-2021T19:30:17,CrRAR,*makes smaller*
08-02-2021T19:30:19,Twokinds,"Yeah it's funny, I way prefer this simple look to the flashy, LED covered ""High end"" stuff"
08-02-2021T19:30:22,SpazztasticKiwi,.....his is also a sponsored custom build
08-02-2021T19:30:44,CrRAR,yeah
08-02-2021T19:31:10,CrRAR,understated can be good
08-02-2021T19:31:20,CrRAR,more monolithic
08-02-2021T19:31:20,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs like Marks alienware I think - he said what parts he‚Äôd like & they built and sent it to him
08-02-2021T19:31:54,CrRAR,*whirring tools and hammer crafting noises*
08-02-2021T19:32:21,Twokinds,I considered prebuilt just to save time but I really didn't need a lot of the stuff the prebuilt come with.
08-02-2021T19:32:24,Twokinds,They usually cater to gamers.
08-02-2021T19:32:28,Twokinds,And my stepmom is not a gamer.
08-02-2021T19:32:49,SpazztasticKiwi,she could be
08-02-2021T19:32:51,SpazztasticKiwi,secretly
08-02-2021T19:33:23,Twokinds,haha
08-02-2021T19:33:29,Twokinds,She does play cards online a lot
08-02-2021T19:33:36,Twokinds,which I guess is technically gaming
08-02-2021T19:33:46,CrRAR,remember the Farmville era?
08-02-2021T19:33:48,CrRAR,oh god
08-02-2021T19:33:49,SpazztasticKiwi,oh boy you know she really could be then
08-02-2021T19:33:59,SpazztasticKiwi,you know Tetris?
08-02-2021T19:34:08,Twokinds,Never heard of it
08-02-2021T19:34:20,SpazztasticKiwi,you better be kidding
08-02-2021T19:34:41,SpazztasticKiwi,anyhoo
08-02-2021T19:34:44,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-clovischuckle:
08-02-2021T19:35:17,CrRAR,your comment earlier about spices spazz reminded me of some Nickelodeon cartoon episode with a very poorly assembled homemade spice rack
08-02-2021T19:35:22,SpazztasticKiwi,those older games like solitaire & chess got a swell of popularity when some company made it online multiplayer
08-02-2021T19:36:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"it opened the chance for older folks to play with others while at home, should they be disabled or unable to reach other players"
08-02-2021T19:36:38,SpazztasticKiwi,so you got NoobKiller69 being beat at chess by ILoveMyGrandkid67
08-02-2021T19:37:18,CrRAR,there was a Gamer Granny I just saw is getting an NPC in the new Skyrim lol
08-02-2021T19:37:33,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah
08-02-2021T19:37:57,SpazztasticKiwi,and Ill let you know i have farmville
08-02-2021T19:38:09,CrRAR,Does it still exist!?
08-02-2021T19:38:12,SpazztasticKiwi,yes
08-02-2021T19:38:18,CrRAR,wow haha
08-02-2021T19:38:37,SpazztasticKiwi,farmville 2 has had an app - still incredibly active - for years
08-02-2021T19:38:48,CrRAR,I just remember how it swept the nation
08-02-2021T19:39:01,CrRAR,there suddenly wasn't anyone that WASN'T playing it
08-02-2021T19:39:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I used to be on it constantly but since I started working and as time passed I lost almost all interest
08-02-2021T19:39:21,CrRAR,"oh cool, but awww"
08-02-2021T19:39:27,SpazztasticKiwi,like with monster legends
08-02-2021T19:39:41,CrRAR,:cow2::pig::chicken:
08-02-2021T19:39:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember I was well into ML when Mark came out with a sponsorship with them
08-02-2021T19:40:15,SpazztasticKiwi,they gave him his own game with a ton of lvl 100 legendary monsters
08-02-2021T19:40:26,SpazztasticKiwi,plus free gems & coins
08-02-2021T19:40:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I was only mildly salty
08-02-2021T19:40:45,CrRAR,wow
08-02-2021T19:40:56,CrRAR,ultimate betrayal
08-02-2021T19:41:03,CrRAR,or something
08-02-2021T19:41:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I highly doubt he plays or even has the app anymore
08-02-2021T19:41:38,CrRAR,"each game it own little lost realm, frozen in time"
08-02-2021T19:41:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd like to have some of the legendarys they gave him
08-02-2021T19:41:45,CrRAR,:cw0lfmare-EmberSad:
08-02-2021T19:42:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I finally earned the one I had my eye on since starting the game years ago & even managed to upgrade him to level 110
08-02-2021T19:42:41,CrRAR,sweet
08-02-2021T19:42:45,SpazztasticKiwi,he‚Äôs my strongest defender in battle
08-02-2021T19:43:02,CrRAR,:cw0lfmare-Paperembercool:
08-02-2021T19:43:06,SpazztasticKiwi,then there‚Äôs my healer who‚Äôs level 110
08-02-2021T19:43:36,SpazztasticKiwi,& the third monster in my lineup can attack or curse the enemy
08-02-2021T19:43:52,SpazztasticKiwi,technically my healer can poison as well
08-02-2021T19:44:33,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs the same as farmville
08-02-2021T19:44:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not on it anymore
08-02-2021T19:44:52,SpazztasticKiwi,rarely
08-02-2021T19:44:53,CrRAR,lvl 100 cow :cow2:

08-02-2021T19:46:19,Twokinds,"I have a switch, but I don't use it much."
08-02-2021T19:46:39,Twokinds,"Honestly, most of my gaming is just whatever Kameloh pulls me into, these days XD"
08-02-2021T19:46:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve thought of a switch off and on but I don‚Äôt see myself playing it much
08-02-2021T19:46:50,CrRAR,haha
08-02-2021T19:47:01,CrRAR,yeah
08-02-2021T19:47:01,SpazztasticKiwi,my phone is really the only thing that stays with me
08-02-2021T19:47:07,Twokinds,"I used to exclusively be a singleplayer gamer, but now I just don't have time. I'm always just playing multiplayer stuff. It's weird."
08-02-2021T19:47:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I HATE that feature
08-02-2021T19:47:28,SpazztasticKiwi,whenever I type ‚Äúmy phone‚Äù my number pops up in autofill
08-02-2021T19:47:38,CrRAR,agh
08-02-2021T19:47:43,CrRAR,that's the worst
08-02-2021T19:48:04,CrRAR,is that like a substitution thing you can disable?
08-02-2021T19:48:13,CrRAR,or literally an autofill?

08-02-2021T19:49:18,NinoGD,I only have the Advance SP
08-02-2021T19:49:29,SpazztasticKiwi,but honestly it‚Äôd be easier for me to type the number out than try to print it with a phrase
