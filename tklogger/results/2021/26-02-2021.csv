26-02-2021T00:12:42,Mediawatcher,I‚Äôm just sitting here wondering where the heck has he been?
26-02-2021T00:12:56,Mediawatcher,He hasn‚Äôt shown up since chapter 19

26-02-2021T00:16:45,ContagiousBordem16,But it would kill the Lynn and saeleen ship

26-02-2021T00:19:15,Mediawatcher,Based on a sketch with maddies father it seems like he survived spending the night with Adelaide
26-02-2021T00:19:22,CrRAR,uhhh wow
26-02-2021T00:19:24,KeefMcDerpface,Air shampoos... How would that work?

26-02-2021T00:19:41,AkelaStormclaw,Lynn has stealth technology lol
26-02-2021T00:19:41,CrRAR,makes no sense tho
26-02-2021T00:20:05,Dadrobit,Could be that Lynn's current status was punishment for being with the king and only producing a runt. Might also be punishment for Maddie being conceived out of season since half the images of him on Patreon are him trying to slink off.
26-02-2021T00:20:06,BadFoMo,How old was this person?

26-02-2021T00:34:20,Mediawatcher,Legosi would win no questions asked
26-02-2021T00:34:39,Dadrobit,They have literally zero reason to fight.
26-02-2021T00:34:59,Dadrobit,They're almost the exact same character
26-02-2021T00:35:11,CrRAR,last slice of pizza
26-02-2021T00:35:20,Dadrobit,At least early books Legosi
26-02-2021T00:35:25,Mediawatcher,That‚Äôs not true legosi never shared pizza with haru
26-02-2021T00:35:26,Asalis,The heck is going on in the comic? o.O

26-02-2021T00:36:10,Mediawatcher,I can kind of admire it for that
26-02-2021T00:36:22,Mediawatcher,"Even if the ending was kind of unsatisfying, for me at least"
26-02-2021T00:36:32,ContagiousBordem16,Haru: let‚Äôs get married then divorced. TF
26-02-2021T00:36:54,ContagiousBordem16,Juno: you‚Äôre not my type
26-02-2021T00:37:04,Mediawatcher,Major characters just disappeared
26-02-2021T00:37:06,Dadrobit,"Eh, it went too far for my own enjoyment."
26-02-2021T00:37:22,Mediawatcher,Like for no reason
26-02-2021T00:37:53,ContagiousBordem16,I fucking hate paru for that crapy ending

26-02-2021T00:40:38,Mediawatcher,Beast complex
26-02-2021T00:40:46,Mediawatcher,It does continue the story a bit

26-02-2021T01:02:18,SageSaga,Zro still around?
26-02-2021T01:02:20,FenceEqualizer,Would be just him hobbling. A shame Sythe got K.O'd again would be the perfect time to slam him with random blunt objects in the area.
26-02-2021T01:02:56,Ordithus,ZRO is in the userlist but this Toyoko may have done them in
26-02-2021T01:02:58,Asalis,or just let him bleed out
26-02-2021T01:03:06,Zakuru,i just heard a story about a musician who had their nuts blown off with a glitter cannon on stage and just continued playing until the show was over and went to the hospital. ... it is possible ;w;
26-02-2021T01:03:13,Zakuru,(the musicians name is super long)

26-02-2021T01:06:41,Asalis,"SageSaga, it's also possible he may have intentionally played through the pain out of a sort of self sense of professionalism."
26-02-2021T01:07:04,SageSaga,thats stupid Asalis
26-02-2021T01:07:14,ContagiousBordem16,Noodle I feel like you‚Äôve seen children of Poseidon balls to the wall video

26-02-2021T01:07:17,FenceEqualizer,I mean if a man can manage to keep playing pass the finals then I think a man can do anything with a hgh enough pain tolereance.
26-02-2021T01:07:36,Asalis,Never the less i've seen and heard many instance of just that same thing @SageSaga. It can and does happen more than you think.
26-02-2021T01:07:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve stopped driving for a cramp to pass before
26-02-2021T01:07:43,ImTheBeyondPale,"no, its basically alsmost enough to down any man, its the same effect of a liver shot but way worse"
26-02-2021T01:07:55,SageSaga,I dont care if it happens- everyone who just lets that go is stupid
26-02-2021T01:08:03,SpazztasticKiwi,getting a part blown off by a glorified confetti cannon has to hurt somehow
26-02-2021T01:08:04,SageSaga,"that level of ""professionalism"" is toxic"
26-02-2021T01:08:19,Asalis,I never said it wasn't
26-02-2021T01:08:22,SpazztasticKiwi,like maybe shock kept him going but
26-02-2021T01:08:33,SageSaga,then dont make excuses for it

26-02-2021T01:08:39,Asalis,but it would have been his choice at that point and no one elses
26-02-2021T01:08:54,Zakuru,there was an interview
26-02-2021T01:09:04,Zakuru,... i dare not copy and paste here

26-02-2021T01:10:17,Zakuru,nope

26-02-2021T01:10:36,Asalis,"@Zakuru, I just found it on google and read it. He actually did choose to continue playing through the pain. o.o"
26-02-2021T01:10:38,Dadrobit,Just read his interview about it. He ruptured his left testicle. He continued playing because he was pissed that he messed up and wasn't standing in the right place on stage. Half a liter of blood had to be removed from his scrotum.
26-02-2021T01:10:39,Asalis,that's dedication

26-02-2021T01:11:23,Zakuru,he almost passed out from the pain
26-02-2021T01:11:26,AspiringNoodle,Then there's just pure destructive sacrifice

26-02-2021T01:11:56,FenceEqualizer,No one is dead until I see a body.
26-02-2021T01:12:01,SpazztasticKiwi,pride isn‚Äôt worth losing a body part even if you can technically live without it
26-02-2021T01:12:10,Mediawatcher,Who were you guys talking about?
26-02-2021T01:12:17,Mediawatcher,Was it an athlete?
26-02-2021T01:12:19,SpazztasticKiwi,what if prolonging getting help had caused complications
26-02-2021T01:12:22,Zakuru,a musician
26-02-2021T01:12:22,SageSaga,but ive also been so sick i cant work- so i just make up for the update later or contact a friend to help

26-02-2021T01:22:44,FenceEqualizer,Tom has the excuse of Rule of Wookie. Long as there no bits Youtube doesn't care for a small channel like tkstreams

26-02-2021T01:23:21,TheSexyBeast,I saw a complaint in the full stream from last Sunday that it was without any music.
26-02-2021T01:23:44,TheSexyBeast,The YT comments section
26-02-2021T01:23:45,FenceEqualizer,Honestly they'd probably care more about the music if anything.
26-02-2021T01:24:03,Dadrobit,The music is 100% infringement yes.
26-02-2021T01:24:11,ContagiousBordem16,I think those vids might get copyrighted bc of the music
26-02-2021T01:24:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve noticed there‚Äôs a TK fanpage on ig

26-02-2021T01:24:33,SageSaga,yeah- because Tom would have to be the one that made a claim on the video
26-02-2021T01:24:36,SpazztasticKiwi,suggested

26-02-2021T01:25:29,ZapiliDver,It's from his VK group
26-02-2021T01:25:38,FenceEqualizer,Even with music being an issue most copyright holders will just slap there name on your description fund. Take ad revenue and call it a day on youtube.
26-02-2021T01:26:03,SageSaga,wat
26-02-2021T01:26:30,SageSaga,that doesnt make sense- Tom is the copyright holder- so only the music owners could do anything

26-02-2021T01:26:35,ContagiousBordem16,Basically the to streams in a nutshell on yt
26-02-2021T01:26:45,FenceEqualizer,That's what i'm talking about. I'm talking about the music holders

26-02-2021T01:26:48,Dadrobit,"Yeah, Fence. They did that with me for using the inception music on a school project video."

26-02-2021T01:27:33,TheSexyBeast,"I mean, it's about the art, but they were complaining about no music? Couldn't they have opened up a second tab and stream whatever music they wanted to?"
26-02-2021T01:27:34,ZapiliDver,DMCA sometimes gives a real bullshit

26-02-2021T01:28:07,SageSaga,DMCA helps a lot too
26-02-2021T01:28:14,Dadrobit,Tom would have to go through a ton of work to get synchronization and performance licenses from all the artists he uses music from to make it all above board.

26-02-2021T03:03:18,FenceEqualizer,Night Tom thanks for streaming
26-02-2021T03:03:29,steelabjur,"Thanks for the stream, Tom!"
26-02-2021T03:03:34,SageSaga,at least i hope- it said it was gonna be delivered today- but they LIIIIEED
26-02-2021T03:03:42,SageSaga,i mean- were incorrect
26-02-2021T03:04:34,Dadrobit,"""cpu is in Texas."" At first I thought it was some kind of weird slang lol"
26-02-2021T03:05:06,FenceEqualizer,Shoot hopefully it won't get delayed. Has Texas thawed yet?
26-02-2021T03:05:38,SageSaga,it's currently 60f there- so its fine XD
26-02-2021T03:06:01,CrRAR,gotta deal with the aftermath tho too
26-02-2021T03:06:23,FenceEqualizer,Like the jerks trying to rip off residents with insane eletric bills.
26-02-2021T03:06:34,SageSaga,they arent trying to rip anyone off
26-02-2021T03:06:57,SageSaga,that wasnt a trap
26-02-2021T03:07:46,Dadrobit,Watching other states go through bullshit weather makes me so appreciative that arizona is literally a weather paradise (so long as you're not homeless in the summer in Phoenix)
26-02-2021T03:08:00,FenceEqualizer,Someone had to pay 5k a day for eletric. That's insane no matter how you look at it. Not to mention not everyone has the luxery of picking there eletric comapanies.
26-02-2021T03:08:15,FenceEqualizer,Heck Texas officials had to step in to tell the companies to stop
26-02-2021T03:08:16,SageSaga,the highest bill i saw was 17k
26-02-2021T03:08:22,FenceEqualizer,D:
26-02-2021T03:08:27,SageSaga,and technically- totally legal
26-02-2021T03:08:36,InTheLionsDen,Yup
26-02-2021T03:08:56,SageSaga,it wasnt a trap- the people agreed to it- granted they probably never expected it to happen
26-02-2021T03:09:28,SageSaga,and no- they shouldnt have to pay for it- but they also shouldnt have a market driven power grid
26-02-2021T03:09:43,Dadrobit,"Not defending anyone, but it nights also be a case of utility monopoly. They might also just not have had a choice."
26-02-2021T03:10:15,Dadrobit,Like here. There's exactly one option. SRP.
26-02-2021T03:10:17,FenceEqualizer,They shouldn't but my issue is not everyone had a choice. Unless moving out of texas is one.
26-02-2021T03:10:35,SageSaga,SRP is probably government regulated though right?
26-02-2021T03:11:23,Dadrobit,"Salt River Project. I would assume so, they have access to the Palo Verde Nuclear Plant."
26-02-2021T03:11:53,Dadrobit,Something like a third of all of our power is nuclear.
26-02-2021T03:11:54,SageSaga,yeah- thats the thing- the Texas power groups arent government regulated
26-02-2021T03:12:02,SpaceCadety,"17k.  At that point, just shut the power+heat off, let the pipes freeze.  The plumbing work is cheaper."
26-02-2021T03:12:08,SageSaga,they are open market- and legit didnt weatherize after this happened 10 years ago too
26-02-2021T03:12:37,SageSaga,lol Space- that wasnt even a bill- they legit deducted that amount immediately from the guys savings
26-02-2021T03:12:44,Dadrobit,Also happened in '89 as well.
26-02-2021T03:13:02,SageSaga,yeah- they keep saying they will self regulate- but they doooont
26-02-2021T03:13:10,SageSaga,because that cost money
26-02-2021T03:13:16,SageSaga,money they are saving their customers!
26-02-2021T03:13:34,SpaceCadety,"Didn't winterize, then made stupid amounts of money off the shortage that their actions created.  Totally no perverse incentive there."
26-02-2021T03:13:54,FenceEqualizer,Long as money is involved they're not going to. Wouldn't be surprise if they still didn't regulate this.
26-02-2021T03:13:56,Dadrobit,"IIRC, the hurricane that hit them a few years years ago also prompted them to weather proof their systems and they ignored it there as well"
26-02-2021T03:14:06,SageSaga,basically these people with sky high bills are paying a company way less for power- so long as they keep their usage low from their providers
26-02-2021T03:14:32,SageSaga,"unfortunately their power providers shut down in the storm so they had to basically pay ""long distance fees"" of sorts XD for power!"
26-02-2021T03:15:09,Dadrobit,(I am out of oranges. They were amazing. Guard house smells like citrus now)
26-02-2021T03:15:09,SageSaga,and the cost to do that is crazy high to cover their special deal to get their own discount and access to the grid
26-02-2021T03:15:55,SpaceCadety,"Basically if you're going with that plan, you should have a battery or generator backup set up to take over when prices spike."
26-02-2021T03:15:58,SageSaga,so that savings they make gets passed on to the customer- but when there is no savings and extra cost- that gets saddled on the customer too
26-02-2021T03:16:14,SageSaga,actually- yes - 100%
26-02-2021T03:16:40,SageSaga,if you are on one of those plans- get your own battery and solar system- you'll save a bundle and avoid overpaying
26-02-2021T03:17:17,SpaceCadety,or at least a shutoff when you'd rather just go without power rather than pay $9/kwh.
26-02-2021T03:17:58,SageSaga,yeah but the real issue is they dont have a way to alert people that they switched over to the expensive power XD
26-02-2021T03:18:33,Dadrobit,"Read a story or three of folks with Tesla power walls/backup batteries and solar panels actually made it through better than most. Dunno how much is real vs Tesla propaganda, but I'm hopeful."
26-02-2021T03:19:09,SageSaga,the tesla powerwall is a legit piece of tech that saves money
26-02-2021T03:19:40,Dadrobit,Was looking at houses and one of them had a Tesla system. Something like an extra $50 a month.
26-02-2021T03:20:02,SageSaga,if i could afford one - i wouldnt get it- but if i could afford 2 i would- i always want more power than i need XD
26-02-2021T03:27:19,Twokinds,ugh
26-02-2021T03:27:34,Twokinds,"I dropped a knife on my foot, and now I'm bleeding everywhere."
26-02-2021T03:27:41,SageSaga,o_O
26-02-2021T03:27:44,CrRAR,oh dang
26-02-2021T03:27:47,InTheLionsDen,Ouch!
26-02-2021T03:27:49,CrRAR,tom nooo
26-02-2021T03:28:14,Dadrobit,I'm yikers bruh
26-02-2021T03:28:43,CrRAR,was it a food knife?
26-02-2021T03:28:47,Twokinds,ye
26-02-2021T03:29:05,CrRAR,dangit
26-02-2021T03:31:42,CrRAR,next time more sockage for mild knife resistance
26-02-2021T03:31:57,Kameloh,:ckameloh-naokieyes:
26-02-2021T03:31:58,SageSaga,chainmail socks
26-02-2021T03:32:00,Kameloh,Tom are you gonna be okay?
26-02-2021T03:32:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I'm about to passout, nighty night.  Thanks for the streamy Sage, Tom and Ron if you're still here."
26-02-2021T03:32:18,Kameloh,night marv!
26-02-2021T03:32:22,SageSaga,Ron is long gone
26-02-2021T03:32:25,SageSaga,gnight Marv
26-02-2021T03:32:25,CrRAR,:v: marv
26-02-2021T03:33:01,Twokinds,i dunno how to treat an injury
26-02-2021T03:33:16,CrRAR,pressure!
26-02-2021T03:33:17,SageSaga,how deep?
26-02-2021T03:33:46,Twokinds,I dunno.
26-02-2021T03:33:52,Twokinds,It's a small cut. Can't tell how deep.
26-02-2021T03:33:58,Twokinds,It stopped bleeding.
26-02-2021T03:34:06,Kameloh,alcohol rub at least if it ain't too deep
26-02-2021T03:34:08,SageSaga,clean it- bandage it
26-02-2021T03:34:10,Kameloh,but it's gonna hurt
26-02-2021T03:34:18,Twokinds,It doesn't hurt.
26-02-2021T03:34:26,Kameloh,the alcohol is gonna hurt XD
26-02-2021T03:34:29,SageSaga,XD
26-02-2021T03:34:31,CrRAR,probably direct vein hit
26-02-2021T03:34:33,Twokinds,Man
26-02-2021T03:34:37,CrRAR,hence the bloood
26-02-2021T03:34:47,Dadrobit,o/ Marv
26-02-2021T03:35:06,SageSaga,if you stop the bleeding you then gotta clean the wound and cover it - close it up somehow-
26-02-2021T03:35:15,Dadrobit,"No one tell, Spazz. She won't like this."
26-02-2021T03:35:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Don't use alcohol it will scar, just warm water and keep pressure on it.  Aright off to bed for realsizes"
26-02-2021T03:35:22,Kameloh,"yee, with a bandaid if it's small enough"
26-02-2021T03:35:25,Twokinds,I don't have anything to clean it with.
26-02-2021T03:35:27,SageSaga,if you have a sterile glue you can use that but id go with a good ol bandaid
26-02-2021T03:35:28,CrRAR,lol robit
26-02-2021T03:35:33,CrRAR,same thot
26-02-2021T03:35:37,Twokinds,or bandages
26-02-2021T03:35:37,SageSaga,soap and water works if ya dont have anything else
26-02-2021T03:35:47,SageSaga,tape and tissue paper
26-02-2021T03:35:55,CrRAR,tournaquette!
26-02-2021T03:35:58,SageSaga,NO
26-02-2021T03:36:03,Dadrobit,Take a slice of your thigh and use it as a skin graft!
26-02-2021T03:36:03,Kameloh,tissue paper at least and hold it until it stops bleeding
26-02-2021T03:36:14,Kameloh,well if it already stopped
26-02-2021T03:36:20,CrRAR,sacrifice the pants!
26-02-2021T03:36:56,SageSaga,the point of a bandage is incase it starts bleeding again - the bandage applied pressure on its own to help stop it and so you dont  get blood everywhere if it does
26-02-2021T03:37:04,Dadrobit,"Or, ya know, wash your hands and press your thumb onto it for like 2 minutes with steady pressure."
26-02-2021T03:37:09,CrRAR,any iodine?
26-02-2021T03:38:50,SageSaga,i dont know many people who dont have rubbing alcohol but DO have iodine XD
26-02-2021T03:39:12,CrRAR,true
26-02-2021T03:39:14,Hogan,Good morninges!
26-02-2021T03:39:24,CrRAR,hey hogan
26-02-2021T03:39:33,Hogan,Hey CrRAR!
26-02-2021T03:39:48,SageSaga,lol just realized tom recently put together a computer and doesnt have rubbing alcohol
26-02-2021T03:40:01,FenceEqualizer,You leave the chat for 5 minutes and learn someone mutalated themselves.
26-02-2021T03:40:40,SageSaga,rubbing alcohol is often used to help remove thermal paste if ya mess up and have to reapply it - so its pretty commonly used by computer repairmen and builders XD
26-02-2021T03:40:49,CrRAR,yupp
26-02-2021T03:41:07,CrRAR,used it all prepping paste application ;~l
26-02-2021T03:41:42,CrRAR,but yeah isopropyl too often for general cleaning these days too
26-02-2021T03:42:06,SageSaga,well its great for electronics because it dries so fast
26-02-2021T03:42:16,CrRAR,yeah
26-02-2021T03:42:23,SageSaga,and breaks down stuff too
26-02-2021T03:43:19,CrRAR,yeah it‚Äôll take permanent marker clen off most nonporus surfaces
26-02-2021T03:43:27,Twokinds,I used the stock cooler with paste already on it.
26-02-2021T03:43:40,CrRAR,and lots of mild adhesives
26-02-2021T03:43:43,Twokinds,Figured it'd be fine for my stepmother who's just using it for word processing.
26-02-2021T03:43:44,CrRAR,ah true
26-02-2021T03:43:52,CrRAR,yeah
26-02-2021T03:43:54,SageSaga,yeah but if you had an issue you would have had to remove it all and put new stuff on it XD
26-02-2021T03:44:11,Twokinds,I made a makeshift bandage. It started bleeding again when I cleaned it.
26-02-2021T03:44:31,Kameloh,:ckameloh-kuvaeyes:
26-02-2021T03:44:33,SageSaga,yep- its also on your foot so- blood pumps down easily
26-02-2021T03:44:37,Twokinds,I have ethyl alcohol
26-02-2021T03:45:12,Twokinds,Hand sanitizer spray
26-02-2021T03:45:15,Twokinds,Is that... good?
26-02-2021T03:45:48,Dadrobit,"Just checked my own first aid kit. No iodine, but it does have have Zepharin. So it's all good at least. I should probably already know this stuff tbh."
26-02-2021T03:46:07,CrRAR,"probably, just got extra additives"
26-02-2021T03:46:21,Kameloh,it should be okay as long  as you washed or wiped it with water n soap first
26-02-2021T03:46:22,Kameloh,I'm thinkin
26-02-2021T03:46:29,CrRAR,yeah
26-02-2021T03:47:13,SageSaga,once ya get the bleeding to stop- and get in bed it should help stop the bleeding once your legs are up
26-02-2021T03:47:27,Twokinds,"Man it's so stupid. That knife landed so perfectly on my foot, tip down."
26-02-2021T03:47:39,Twokinds,Fell from a counter
26-02-2021T03:47:43,Kameloh,which foot did it get?
26-02-2021T03:48:03,CrRAR,eugh
26-02-2021T03:48:14,Twokinds,Left. Dunno what that matters.
26-02-2021T03:48:15,sunblaze,hi everyone
26-02-2021T03:48:21,Kameloh,maan
26-02-2021T03:48:30,SageSaga,ive been afraid of that happening almost every time ive used a knife- and it never has for me- im always thinking that someones gonna come running at me while ive got a knife in my hand or something and they are going to run into it
26-02-2021T03:48:33,BadFoMo,Yo.
26-02-2021T03:48:36,Kameloh,it may hurt later just watch over it
26-02-2021T03:48:36,SageSaga,yo Sunblaze
26-02-2021T03:48:40,Kameloh,make sure it doesn't open
26-02-2021T03:48:40,BadFoMo,"Also, back."
26-02-2021T03:48:46,Twokinds,Luckily I had my tetanis booster recently.
26-02-2021T03:48:57,CrRAR,oh good
26-02-2021T03:49:20,Kameloh,geez :weary:
26-02-2021T03:49:37,CrRAR,maybe rest with it elevated?
26-02-2021T03:49:38,Twokinds,"Not that I think I'd get tetanis from a steak knife, but... better safe than sorry."
26-02-2021T03:49:47,Kameloh,yeah definitely
26-02-2021T03:50:03,Dadrobit,:/ knifes will get you in the dumbest ways. Dropped a pot in the sink a couple months back. Hit a knife and it flipped up and into my wrist. Fuckin terrified me for a couple seconds.
26-02-2021T03:50:16,Twokinds,jeez
26-02-2021T03:50:39,BadFoMo,Dang.
26-02-2021T03:50:47,Twokinds,Yeah. I'm mostly just worried about infection. I've heard too many medical horror stories that even minor cuts like this leave me paranoid.
26-02-2021T03:51:20,CrRAR,"I jabbed myself with a bowsaw once, just a couple of the teeth. t‚Äôwas fine"
26-02-2021T03:51:25,Kameloh,you should be okay if the knife was clean and ain't rusty
26-02-2021T03:51:39,Dadrobit,"Yeah, studs like cat scratches getting crazy infected. Or a piece of glitter in an eye causing it to need to be removed. Little shit can be crazy dangerous."
26-02-2021T03:51:45,Dadrobit,Stuffs*
26-02-2021T03:53:12,CrRAR,some screen clean wipes have alcohol in them
26-02-2021T03:53:20,CrRAR,or lens ones
26-02-2021T03:53:39,FenceEqualizer,Think You should be fine. You was quick to clean and bandage it. Just check on it tomorrow morning.
26-02-2021T03:55:05,SageSaga,one of my biggest fears is a sudden and mysterious lack of spider
26-02-2021T03:55:19,Kameloh,:ckameloh-kuvaeyes:
26-02-2021T03:55:24,CrRAR,lack of... spider?
26-02-2021T03:55:41,FenceEqualizer,Same to be honest.
26-02-2021T03:55:49,BadFoMo,I think I see where you're going with that.
26-02-2021T03:55:53,SageSaga,yeah you know when you see a spider on the wall or on a table? ya look around for something to get it with and ya look back- AND ITS GONE?!
26-02-2021T03:56:01,CrRAR,I guess if you see spider then don‚Äôt-
26-02-2021T03:56:06,CrRAR,yeah
26-02-2021T03:56:10,CrRAR,lol
26-02-2021T03:56:19,Dadrobit,Yuuuup. Especially when you're camping.
26-02-2021T03:56:21,FenceEqualizer,That's when you tear up the bed room for an hour trying to find it.
26-02-2021T03:57:05,Dadrobit,"When there's a spider on the roof of your tent and when you go to get it, it's nowhere to be seen."
26-02-2021T03:57:34,CrRAR,went off to find Aragog
26-02-2021T03:58:13,SageSaga,gotta say- when i found out about black widow spiders as a kid- i was always terrified of every black spider i saw
26-02-2021T03:58:21,Hogan,"I have mosquitos for that... you can hear one in the room at night, buzzing you crazy, but as soon as you turn on the light to get it... its nowhere to be seen.."
26-02-2021T03:58:22,FenceEqualizer,Spiders are to small and deadly for my liking.
26-02-2021T03:58:30,Twokinds,Yeah same
26-02-2021T03:58:34,SageSaga,then i got kinda lax about em- even to the point where i would just carefully pick em up and take em outside-
26-02-2021T03:58:49,Twokinds,It's like... don't tell me at 10yo about a tiny creature that can just kill me.
26-02-2021T03:58:52,FenceEqualizer,O.o Hell to the nooo
26-02-2021T03:59:00,SageSaga,"then one day i was like ""whoa thats a big spider- gonna take you out-"" picked it up and saw the red hour glass"
26-02-2021T03:59:09,CrRAR,ahhh
26-02-2021T03:59:22,FenceEqualizer,:ptv-shock:
26-02-2021T03:59:27,BadFoMo,Not good!
26-02-2021T03:59:38,SageSaga,after that never picked up a spider by hand again
26-02-2021T03:59:51,SageSaga,cups and paper towels only
26-02-2021T03:59:59,FenceEqualizer,Luckily you picked up a chill Black widow Spider
26-02-2021T04:00:05,SageSaga,but im faaaar more scared of brown spiders- i kill them on sight
26-02-2021T04:00:19,CrRAR,they can get dodgy on a paper towel
26-02-2021T04:00:23,SageSaga,brown recluse can be found here
26-02-2021T04:00:41,SageSaga,i do NOT want my flesh to necrotize and fall off thanks
26-02-2021T04:00:52,CrRAR,yeah I feel like recluse and wolf spiders look alike
26-02-2021T04:00:53,FenceEqualizer,ANyone else getting itchy from this topic?
26-02-2021T04:01:17,SageSaga,ive seen a few Recluses- dont think they look like wolf spiders at all though
26-02-2021T04:01:21,steelabjur,My dad got bit on the back by a brown recluse. Not fun! :x
26-02-2021T04:01:26,CrRAR,warm places have acid spiders which have nasty bites
26-02-2021T04:01:33,SpaceCadety,Don't get many spiders inside here besides wolf spiders.  The occasional jumping.
26-02-2021T04:01:36,CrRAR,hmm
26-02-2021T04:01:52,CrRAR,jumping spiders are neat
26-02-2021T04:02:13,SpaceCadety,Black widows can occasionally be found outside in secluded corners though.
26-02-2021T04:02:54,CrRAR,true recluse have more spindly legs
26-02-2021T04:03:08,CrRAR,and more bulbous thorax
26-02-2021T04:03:19,CrRAR,no stripes either
26-02-2021T04:04:21,FenceEqualizer,People say don't kill spiders cause they get rid of the bad bugs in your house. But honestly they're one of the bad bugs.
26-02-2021T04:05:04,ZRO4825,Depends on the spider in question.
26-02-2021T04:05:08,ZRO4825,Most of them are not the bad bugs.
26-02-2021T04:05:15,SageSaga,yep
26-02-2021T04:05:28,ZRO4825,"But there are a few, like Sage mentioned, Recluses and the like, that are definitely ""You do not remain within my home""."
26-02-2021T04:05:36,Dadrobit,https://imgur.com/a/vYhcjh3 This sumbitch snuck up onto my wall about a year back. Was not prepared for it....
26-02-2021T04:05:58,FenceEqualizer,At lUntil we develoupe technology that allows me to kindly ask the spider to vacate the house. I don't trust. You get one chance witht he cup and paper towel.
26-02-2021T04:05:59,ZRO4825,Tarantula! :D
26-02-2021T04:06:18,SageSaga,yeah Tarantulas dont bother me that much
26-02-2021T04:06:24,ZRO4825,"To be fair, i'd probably have freaked a little bit, lol. But I'd have calmed down after a moment Tarantulas are actually mostly harmless to humans."
26-02-2021T04:06:35,SpaceCadety,"If it has stripes here, it's some species of wolf spider.  Which pretty much is best left alone."
26-02-2021T04:06:39,ZRO4825,"Their bite hurts, but it's like, bee sting level iirc from reading?"
26-02-2021T04:06:44,Dadrobit,"I know it was harmless, but I still swept it outside."
26-02-2021T04:06:46,FenceEqualizer,BItes hurt like hell but not deadly.
26-02-2021T04:06:57,FenceEqualizer,You made the right call Robit
26-02-2021T04:07:11,SageSaga,they dont often bite either do they?
26-02-2021T04:07:27,ZRO4825,Not really. That's why they're more common as pets.
26-02-2021T04:07:39,Dadrobit,My brother never woulda let me hear the end of it if I killed a tarantula. He loves creepy crawlies and reptiles.
26-02-2021T04:07:46,SpaceCadety,Tarantulas have big fangs.  I reckon those would hurt more than a bee sting even if they didn't use venom.
26-02-2021T04:08:02,SageSaga,im pretty sure they only bite if they are in pain or cornered
26-02-2021T04:08:33,FenceEqualizer,True but I rather get a swollen hand from a tarantula bite then having my skin melt from a freaking brown recluse
26-02-2021T04:08:39,SpaceCadety,"but yeah, they're far more likely to just bolt for cover rather than bite."
26-02-2021T04:08:49,FenceEqualizer,Plus Tarantulas are not small little death ninjas
26-02-2021T04:09:09,SageSaga,meanwhile a brown recluse is-
26-02-2021T04:11:26,SageSaga,small and brown - very unassuming
26-02-2021T04:12:08,SageSaga,also - i think the facehugger was based on the brown recluse?
26-02-2021T04:12:55,FenceEqualizer,"lol, i'd believe it."
26-02-2021T04:13:22,Dadrobit,Tarantulas are defo not ninjas. They are large enough that you can actually hear them skitter around. It's reaaaaaly unsettling.
26-02-2021T04:13:37,SageSaga,it looks like it but it looks like they officially say its based on a human hand and a penis... huh-
26-02-2021T04:13:51,SpaceCadety,I've seen some wolf spiders with 1''+ legspans.  nothing bigger than that though.
26-02-2021T04:14:10,SageSaga,wolf spiders are mostly harmless too though
26-02-2021T04:15:05,SpaceCadety,Yeah.  They kill crickets like mad too.
26-02-2021T04:29:33,SageSaga,Done!
26-02-2021T04:29:48,SageSaga,gnight folks! take care!
26-02-2021T04:30:04,SageSaga,i'll be back in 10 hours and 30 minutes - i think
26-02-2021T04:30:06,FenceEqualizer,NIcely done Sage and thank you for streaming!
26-02-2021T04:30:30,Hogan,Thanks for the stream and company!

26-02-2021T05:10:00,Dadrobit,"Back for a sec. Hey, Tom, if you're still around, are you doing Nora Cards again?"
26-02-2021T05:47:25,Twokinds,Why do you ask?
26-02-2021T05:47:41,Twokinds,"Oh, you mean because someone took Rose Daki?"
26-02-2021T05:48:05,Twokinds,"Yeah, one of the Nora Card holders is... a little reluctant to use their remaining Nora Cards, so they've been saving them."
26-02-2021T05:49:07,Twokinds,"I am planning on opening up Nora Cards again soon, though. I'm almost caught up."
26-02-2021T05:59:56,Dadrobit,"Ahh, gotcha, thanks. Yeah, I saw the mention on the vote and was curious."
26-02-2021T06:01:08,Dadrobit,Didn't know just holding on to a NC spot for options was a thing lol. Figured folks would buy in knowing exactly what they'd want for the money lol.

26-02-2021T13:13:45,CrRAR,:blossom:
26-02-2021T13:40:16,SpazztasticKiwi,who‚Äôs gotten a tax letter from 2019
26-02-2021T13:42:04,CrRAR,A whole tax letter?
26-02-2021T13:54:53,SpazztasticKiwi,they adjusted my form and found problems despite sending me a refund that year and not mentioning any issues even next or this year
26-02-2021T13:56:27,SpazztasticKiwi,they‚Äôre telling me it‚Äôs got interest per day despite me not getting the letter until today when it was due monday & their office is closed so there‚Äôs no talking to a representative like the letter suggests as an option
26-02-2021T13:57:30,CrRAR,"yeah, weird. Never really knew the IRS to intervene in old stuff unless provoked"
26-02-2021T13:57:42,CrRAR,"or like, an audit type thing"
26-02-2021T13:59:10,AspiringNoodle,"Honestly, the IRS has too much power for how easy it is for them to mess up on their end"
26-02-2021T13:59:34,CrRAR,"yeah, so much of tax law is subjective"
26-02-2021T13:59:53,AspiringNoodle,"When my father was younger and he worked for a business that he and his dad ran, some worker for the IRS added a few zeroes to a particular entry, and it set off a giant shitstorm"
26-02-2021T14:00:22,AspiringNoodle,"Was completely a mistake on their part, but the headaches that my father had to deal with were not..."
26-02-2021T14:00:22,CrRAR,g r e a t
26-02-2021T14:01:06,AspiringNoodle,"It was something along the lines of they missed a decimal point.  iirc, it was personal expenses using business money?"
26-02-2021T14:01:45,AspiringNoodle,"The value should have been $20, but they missed the decimal point in $20.00, and so it came off as $2000, and apparently that set off all sorts of red flags."
26-02-2021T14:02:08,CrRAR,yeah without supporting evidence
26-02-2021T14:02:20,AspiringNoodle,"So yeah, my biggest complaint about the IRS is that they're too powerful"
26-02-2021T14:02:28,AspiringNoodle,"When THEY fuck up, it's on YOU to prove that they did."
26-02-2021T14:02:43,CrRAR,"too powerful, yet horribly inept lol"
26-02-2021T14:02:57,AspiringNoodle,And considering the stuff they can do... and how harsh the penalties are...
26-02-2021T14:03:24,CrRAR,yeah it‚Äôs just how much it‚Äôs up to interpretation
26-02-2021T14:03:32,AspiringNoodle,"Fun fact, the IRS can garnish 85% of your wages to cover any owed taxes, or if you fail to do proper paperwork until you set things straight"
26-02-2021T14:03:44,CrRAR,They be like ‚Äútell us your tax story‚Äù
26-02-2021T14:03:53,CrRAR,*submits taxes*
26-02-2021T14:03:53,AspiringNoodle,"And if you're self-employed (like I am, since I'm officially an independent contractor), that amount is 100%"
26-02-2021T14:04:01,CrRAR,"‚Äúnah, we don‚Äôt like it‚Äù"
26-02-2021T14:04:05,CrRAR,‚Äúdo it again‚Äù
26-02-2021T14:04:38,AspiringNoodle,I believe Obama tried to institute paperless filing.
26-02-2021T14:05:11,AspiringNoodle,The idea being that they can collect most of the information they need without needing to bother the individual.
26-02-2021T14:05:18,CrRAR,I feel like so much could be automated except I guess for the self-earners
26-02-2021T14:05:49,AspiringNoodle,"They'd send you a form with the relevant information, and then you'd either correct the information they presented, or add anything they missed."
26-02-2021T14:06:01,SpazztasticKiwi,they‚Äôre saying after all this time I owe over 700 fucking $
26-02-2021T14:06:16,CrRAR,could it be a false letter?
26-02-2021T14:06:20,SpazztasticKiwi,and there‚Äôs interest and fees every day
26-02-2021T14:06:20,AspiringNoodle,"""How about no."""
26-02-2021T14:07:07,AspiringNoodle,The plus side of the US tax code is that it's possible to pay very little in taxes.
26-02-2021T14:07:16,CrRAR,yeah that‚Äôs crazy
26-02-2021T14:07:19,CrRAR,"I would look up an IRS number not on the form, to rule out it being a scam."
26-02-2021T14:07:36,AspiringNoodle,The downside is that it's so convoluted and complicated that we literally have dedicated tax professionals and software to ease the burden on the individuals...
26-02-2021T14:08:05,SpazztasticKiwi,the number to contact them on the letter matches the website
26-02-2021T14:08:57,AspiringNoodle,"Oh boy, so not only did they ""find"" a discrepancy, but they decided to wait 2 years to tell you?"
26-02-2021T14:09:03,AspiringNoodle,What a great system!
26-02-2021T14:09:14,CrRAR,"how the heck do they just decide suddenly you owe, that‚Äôs so weird."
26-02-2021T14:09:58,CrRAR,"they sure wouldn‚Äôt ever be like ‚Äúoh we redid some math, $500 in your favor‚Äù"
26-02-2021T14:10:07,CrRAR,*sends check*
26-02-2021T14:11:05,CrRAR,though taxes apparently for the last year have been delayed
26-02-2021T14:11:31,CrRAR,I think my brother is like still waiting for 2019‚Äôs to be processed for some reason
26-02-2021T14:12:13,CrRAR,Maybe they finally got around to processing?
26-02-2021T14:12:27,SpazztasticKiwi,unless there‚Äôs different numbers
26-02-2021T14:12:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm gonna try another number on the site
26-02-2021T14:12:47,CrRAR,ok
26-02-2021T14:12:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"if this is a scam, they already have my ssn because it‚Äôs on the letter"
26-02-2021T14:14:40,CrRAR,"Well, I guess when you get someone they will point out what in particular caused it. Maybe they need proof of something."
26-02-2021T14:15:30,CrRAR,"like ‚Äúoh, you claimed this thing but didn‚Äôt attach ‚ÄòX‚Äô if you submit that this 700 will disappear‚Äù"
26-02-2021T14:16:55,CrRAR,Like there shouldn‚Äôt be a discrepancy in what the outcome was when you filed and now. That‚Äôs really the thing to figure out.
26-02-2021T14:17:15,CrRAR,What changed

26-02-2021T14:21:30,AspiringNoodle,And I've only done 450 or so miles for the year.  So this week alone I've already made my business usage ~25%

26-02-2021T15:45:40,SageSaga,a yes would have worked
26-02-2021T15:46:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt know if I have one now - I haven‚Äôt checked & since I‚Äôve finally got back to bed I don‚Äôt really care to
26-02-2021T15:46:32,SageSaga,did ya get tested?
26-02-2021T15:46:58,SageSaga,if you are freezing and its over 65 you probably are having fever chills
26-02-2021T15:47:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt have the symptoms of covid and I didn‚Äôt ask for a test but I got meds that cover strep and a sinus infection should it be that or something else trying to brew

26-02-2021T15:50:29,Ordithus,I would have figured the doc would have asked you get tested
26-02-2021T15:50:38,SpazztasticKiwi,nah
26-02-2021T15:50:51,SageSaga,"oxygen and chest being ""clear"" can just mean you arent experiencing the more dangerous symptoms"
26-02-2021T15:51:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a cough from the dry throat but he said the dry throat was from sinus inflammation
26-02-2021T15:51:54,SageSaga,ok so you probably have a sinus infection
26-02-2021T15:52:07,SpazztasticKiwi,so told him there wasn‚Äôt a cough when he asked
26-02-2021T15:52:37,Ordithus,sinus infections are not fun
26-02-2021T15:52:55,SageSaga,they still should have tested to be safe though
26-02-2021T15:52:59,SpazztasticKiwi,and there was body pains but I haven‚Äôt had them since that first day even when the medicine wore off
26-02-2021T15:54:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I was told to come back if it sticks around after the antibiotics
26-02-2021T15:55:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"but while I said it felt like the flu - despite my flu shot - a sinus infection, or strep, he didn‚Äôt order any test because my throat wasn‚Äôt inflamed enough to be strep according to him"
26-02-2021T15:55:51,SpazztasticKiwi,and I guess I didn‚Äôt have any other symptoms for the other tests
26-02-2021T15:57:00,SageSaga,i find it silly that anyone goes to the doctor over flu like symptoms these days and they dont test for Covid just in case
26-02-2021T15:57:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"find it silly, I don‚Äôt care"
26-02-2021T15:57:30,ZapiliDver,btw my work require me to do one PCR test per two week.
26-02-2021T15:57:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt have other symptoms & they didn‚Äôt bring up getting a test
26-02-2021T15:57:50,SageSaga,cool- hope you dont turn out to have covid and end up spreading it to your family
26-02-2021T15:58:02,SpazztasticKiwi,what pcr
26-02-2021T15:58:25,SpazztasticKiwi,that doesn‚Äôt sound sarcastic at all
26-02-2021T15:58:48,ZapiliDver,PCR test on COVID description: https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/21462-covid-19-and-pcr-testing
26-02-2021T15:59:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"even at 99.5, they don‚Äôt consider that a fever"
26-02-2021T15:59:25,SageSaga,you said you were on fever suppressants though
26-02-2021T15:59:39,Ordithus,that wasn't sarcastic! though it could read that way
26-02-2021T15:59:46,SpazztasticKiwi,oh the nose swab thing
26-02-2021T16:00:20,Ordithus,the brain pick
26-02-2021T16:00:22,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah and I told them that yet they still said they don‚Äôt contact a fever anything under 100
26-02-2021T16:00:36,SpazztasticKiwi,or 101-104
26-02-2021T16:00:46,ZapiliDver,"Yeah, my nose and throat don't like it, but i prefer to get information early."
26-02-2021T16:01:06,SageSaga,yeah but there is no way to tell what your fever actually is if you are on meds that help reduce a fever
26-02-2021T16:01:08,SpazztasticKiwi,my last dose was ~2-3 am
26-02-2021T16:01:24,SpazztasticKiwi,they saw me maybe 10:30
26-02-2021T16:04:05,SpazztasticKiwi,to be honest I took something before I went to be at 1ish but woke up later feeling bad so I took another until I looked at the time and realized I may have taken it early
26-02-2021T16:05:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"so, 12-1am then more at 2-4 am"
26-02-2021T16:05:36,SpazztasticKiwi,but hey I‚Äôm not dead
26-02-2021T16:06:22,Ordithus,\o/

26-02-2021T16:17:10,SpazztasticKiwi,otherwise I‚Äôm not keen on getting up
26-02-2021T16:17:27,CrRAR,no move is sometimes the best move
26-02-2021T16:18:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom said he was feeling like an old t model car too
26-02-2021T16:18:56,SpazztasticKiwi,anyone‚Äôs guess if he‚Äôs still feeling one foot in the graveish
26-02-2021T16:19:15,SageSaga,back

26-02-2021T16:26:04,CrRAR,lol yeah
26-02-2021T16:26:31,CrRAR,"it's been freezing here a while, but the birds singing their glories"
26-02-2021T16:26:54,ZapiliDver,"-20*C, two days passed and +6*C... and now back to low temperature"
26-02-2021T16:27:00,CrRAR,like it'll wake springtime or something
26-02-2021T16:27:08,CrRAR,ouch
26-02-2021T16:27:11,Ordithus,well crap. emergency home depot run. brand new dryer vent leaks
26-02-2021T16:27:20,CrRAR,aw heck no
26-02-2021T16:27:21,Ordithus,be back later
26-02-2021T16:27:28,CrRAR,like leaks... air?
26-02-2021T16:27:33,CrRAR,got a slice?
26-02-2021T16:27:38,CrRAR,ok
26-02-2021T16:27:59,Ordithus,"just out the side, hard to describe. no cuts"
26-02-2021T16:28:22,CrRAR,"agh, ok godspeed"
26-02-2021T16:28:33,Ordithus,"and it is a gas dryer, so super important it does not leak"
26-02-2021T16:29:01,ZapiliDver,"ouch, that is really bad"
26-02-2021T16:29:03,CrRAR,"ah, yeah don't need no exhaust where you don't want it"
26-02-2021T16:31:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I turned my carbon monoxide alarm off because it was giving me a headache
26-02-2021T16:32:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I read that somewhere & it‚Äôs stuck with me ever since
26-02-2021T16:36:16,SageSaga,wut
26-02-2021T16:36:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"this is a stupid question but among a few other choice conditions, epilepsy would bar you from becoming a dr right"
26-02-2021T16:36:52,SageSaga,no
26-02-2021T16:37:11,SpazztasticKiwi,just a surgeon maybe?
26-02-2021T16:37:41,SageSaga,depends on the kind of epilepsy
26-02-2021T16:38:07,SageSaga,some have certain repeatable triggers and theres also medications to suppress them
26-02-2021T16:38:16,ZapiliDver,"Turning off CO/CO2 sensors isn't a good idea, if you have some gas-powered equipment in house."
26-02-2021T16:45:54,SageSaga,the only way i see people thinking a CO2 sensor is causing a headache is when they are having CO2 poisoning and that darn beeping is making it worse-
26-02-2021T16:46:20,SpazztasticKiwi,that was the joke
26-02-2021T16:46:30,SpazztasticKiwi,unless the person was serious
26-02-2021T16:46:48,SpazztasticKiwi,but from where it was posted I took it as a joke
26-02-2021T16:47:31,SageSaga,so you meant to type that with quotes around it?
26-02-2021T16:47:45,SageSaga,because thats a VERY different context
26-02-2021T16:50:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt have gas anything
26-02-2021T16:50:28,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs all electric
26-02-2021T16:51:03,SageSaga,weird way to say yes?
26-02-2021T16:51:13,SpazztasticKiwi,& I would hope it‚Äôd be understood that I‚Äôm not that stupid
26-02-2021T16:51:54,FoxxTrotter,:cfoxxtrotter-ReniRawr::cfoxxtrotter-ReniRawr:
26-02-2021T16:51:55,SageSaga,we would hope so too but you did say that you did it- so
26-02-2021T16:52:11,SageSaga,we can only assume you are telling the truth ya know?
26-02-2021T16:52:26,SpazztasticKiwi,we do have an alarm I believe but I don‚Äôt see why if everything‚Äôs electric
26-02-2021T16:53:03,SageSaga,because fires still generate toxic fumes
26-02-2021T16:53:03,SpazztasticKiwi,unless it‚Äôs a fancy looking smoke alarm
26-02-2021T16:53:39,SageSaga,. . .
26-02-2021T16:53:46,SageSaga,see this is why im concerned
26-02-2021T16:54:07,SpazztasticKiwi,it can‚Äôt be turned off in any case
26-02-2021T16:54:30,SpazztasticKiwi,it plugs in the kitchen & beeps when disconnected
26-02-2021T16:54:33,SageSaga,CO2 detectors ARE smoke detectors
26-02-2021T16:55:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I know
26-02-2021T16:55:28,SageSaga,you just said- wat- how-
26-02-2021T16:55:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean it doesn‚Äôt look like the usual round thing that sticks on the ceiling
26-02-2021T16:55:41,SageSaga,omg
26-02-2021T16:58:33,FoxxTrotter,We have a combo detector. Easier than buying two separate ones.
26-02-2021T17:01:28,SageSaga,most detectors are 2 in 1s these days
26-02-2021T17:01:30,SpazztasticKiwi,co-co-combo
26-02-2021T17:01:48,FoxxTrotter,"Yes, they are."
26-02-2021T17:02:29,FoxxTrotter,"I'm sure some places still sell those plug-in CO alarms, though."
26-02-2021T17:02:32,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs a nod to combo breaker
26-02-2021T17:02:51,SpazztasticKiwi,that‚Äôs where my brain went
26-02-2021T17:04:02,CrRAR,combos: also a delicious snack
26-02-2021T17:04:38,SageSaga,i never liked combos
26-02-2021T17:04:57,CrRAR,"tbh, I‚Äôve had them like once lol"
26-02-2021T17:05:03,FoxxTrotter,I've never tried the Combos snacks.
26-02-2021T17:05:08,CrRAR,they‚Äôre a bit too salty
26-02-2021T17:05:20,CrRAR,:cw0lfmare-Saltyember:
26-02-2021T17:06:01,CrRAR,But pretzels and peanut butter are a win
26-02-2021T17:06:08,CrRAR,and chocolate
26-02-2021T17:06:30,CrRAR,cheese is a 3rd place choice
26-02-2021T17:08:11,CrRAR,Bugels sort of fall into the ‚Äòcombos‚Äô snack catagory
26-02-2021T17:08:38,CrRAR,‚Äúoh.. it‚Äôs bugels‚Äù
26-02-2021T17:08:40,CrRAR,‚Äúok‚Äù
26-02-2021T17:08:56,FoxxTrotter,I don't like Bugles.
26-02-2021T17:09:44,CrRAR,"yeah they‚Äôre weird, it‚Äôs like cap‚Äôn crunch texture minus any sugary flavor"
26-02-2021T17:10:01,SpazztasticKiwi,don‚Äôt tell me there‚Äôs an actual food called combos
26-02-2021T17:10:05,CrRAR,lol
26-02-2021T17:10:08,CrRAR,there is
26-02-2021T17:10:12,SpazztasticKiwi,where
26-02-2021T17:10:17,SpazztasticKiwi,we don‚Äôt have that
26-02-2021T17:10:23,CrRAR,they‚Äôre just cheese filled przel bites
26-02-2021T17:10:27,CrRAR,pretzel
26-02-2021T17:10:43,SpazztasticKiwi,oh we might have a knockoff version of that
26-02-2021T17:10:55,SpazztasticKiwi,sounds.....possibly tasty
26-02-2021T17:11:17,CrRAR,remember the cheese and breadstick lunch snacks?
26-02-2021T17:11:28,SpazztasticKiwi,oh yeah
26-02-2021T17:11:34,CrRAR,I think there was a pretzel version of those
26-02-2021T17:11:42,SageSaga,started reading another book series
26-02-2021T17:11:51,CrRAR,I should order more peanut butter pretzels
26-02-2021T17:11:55,CrRAR,"oh, yeah?"
26-02-2021T17:12:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"oh speaking of snacks, I officially saw dunkaroos back in stores recently"
26-02-2021T17:12:17,SageSaga,this 16 year old girl just found out shes a grandmother
26-02-2021T17:12:25,CrRAR,oh?
26-02-2021T17:12:27,SageSaga,and then met her great grandson
26-02-2021T17:12:41,CrRAR,interesting
26-02-2021T17:12:50,CrRAR,Have you seen Maquia?
26-02-2021T17:12:57,CrRAR,kinda that vibe
26-02-2021T17:13:17,CrRAR,like girl that doesn‚Äôt age raises a kid as her son
26-02-2021T17:13:18,SpazztasticKiwi,the only physical book I finished recently is midnight sun
26-02-2021T17:13:28,SageSaga,and her daughter is terrified because her son- the MCs Grandson - pissed off her Mother - the great grandmother - that is 16
26-02-2021T17:13:33,SpazztasticKiwi,the others are digital romance
26-02-2021T17:13:36,CrRAR,ah
26-02-2021T17:13:45,CrRAR,Maquia sounds kinda similar
26-02-2021T17:13:49,SageSaga,and the MC is an OP elf character that can demolish a city with magic
26-02-2021T17:13:56,CrRAR,sounds like it could be like a prequel lol
26-02-2021T17:14:02,SageSaga,and yeah ive seen Maquia
26-02-2021T17:14:21,SageSaga,this is an isekai where the girl is in her MMO characters body-
26-02-2021T17:14:28,CrRAR,ah
26-02-2021T17:14:37,SageSaga,shes a high elf that is over 200 years old- thus the great grand kids XD
26-02-2021T17:15:14,CrRAR,haha
26-02-2021T17:15:22,SageSaga,but its funny because her daughter thought it would be funny to not tell her who she was going to be meeting
26-02-2021T17:15:41,SageSaga,and was like SURPRISE! you're a great grandma!
26-02-2021T17:15:53,CrRAR,pfhh
26-02-2021T17:16:13,SageSaga,"but instead he accidentally insulted her and she was like ""OH CRAP! Please momma! dont destroy my kiiiiidsss!!!!"""
26-02-2021T17:16:56,SageSaga,"which makes her more angry because - ""Why do you think i would kill my grandchildren?! what kinda mother AM I?!"""

26-02-2021T17:18:21,SageSaga,i think her character in the game was probably known for doing all sorts of crazy things XD
26-02-2021T17:18:35,CrRAR,ahh I see
26-02-2021T17:19:07,SageSaga,i dont even know the titles name- i havent read the title in months since i picked up the first book- the second just came out and i preordered it - so it just showed up in my library and i started it without reading the title XD
26-02-2021T17:19:21,CrRAR,oh neat
26-02-2021T17:19:37,CrRAR,a confirmed pageturner
26-02-2021T17:21:13,SageSaga,found it
26-02-2021T17:21:17,SageSaga,In the Land of Leadale
26-02-2021T17:21:26,SageSaga,and - its ok XD its not great imo
26-02-2021T17:21:42,SageSaga,i read lots of bad books as well as good and great books
26-02-2021T17:21:54,SageSaga,its all research- and fun

26-02-2021T17:27:25,CrRAR,I am upset that it appears new dunkaroos don‚Äôt seem to have the kangaroo mascot
26-02-2021T17:28:27,SageSaga,i have found a serious lack of genderbending isekai stories
26-02-2021T17:28:55,CrRAR,hmm
26-02-2021T17:29:05,SageSaga,i thought i would have found at least a really bad one by now
26-02-2021T17:29:12,BadFoMo,What's 'Isekai' mean?
26-02-2021T17:29:18,SageSaga,In another World

26-02-2021T17:30:49,CrRAR,fantasy elements kinda obligatory
26-02-2021T17:32:16,SageSaga,i think ive only found one so far- and it basically sidesteps it completely
26-02-2021T17:32:24,SageSaga,oh no wait- ive found 2
26-02-2021T17:32:28,SageSaga,but both sidestep it

26-02-2021T17:33:02,SageSaga,i found one with a guy that turns into his female game character- but basically nothing happens at all in terms of that-
26-02-2021T17:33:36,SageSaga,"and the other a woman is reincarnated as a prince- and nothing really comes of that other than funny BL comments about ""his"" brothers relationship with a knight"

26-02-2021T18:27:33,SpazztasticKiwi,and at this rate it means what little left I had to lose - and what I‚Äôve gained back - is likely not going anywhere anymore

26-02-2021T20:34:15,AspiringNoodle,But it also adds a bunch of fat that jacks up the calorie count
26-02-2021T20:34:53,AspiringNoodle,"This is why I am a fan of Popeyes.  If I want a lower calorie option, I can get blackened chicken tenders and mashed potatoes (my go-to side) for a huge reduction in calories."
