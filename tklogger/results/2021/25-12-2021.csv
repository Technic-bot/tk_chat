25-12-2021T16:40:41,KaplanSektyPieczarek,So I told him (or her) a story how my religion was founded

25-12-2021T16:45:57,KuroSuki64,indeed
25-12-2021T16:46:30,KaplanSektyPieczarek,later I found that my and friend base was attacked by the admin

25-12-2021T16:50:46,KaplanSektyPieczarek,Admin went on creative mode and spawned hundreds of mobs
25-12-2021T16:50:53,KaplanSektyPieczarek,Our base was a village
25-12-2021T16:51:00,KaplanSektyPieczarek,so we defended it

25-12-2021T17:56:56,Glassan,Doge will bonk you back to horni jail
25-12-2021T17:57:20,KaplanSektyPieczarek,I'm not too but I just can't stop watching it
25-12-2021T17:57:55,ProsePro7,So who is pulling for what on the color tonight?
25-12-2021T17:58:18,ProsePro7,I'm hoping for Cave Keith and the Dire chicks obviously 
25-12-2021T17:58:25,ZapiliDver,Our perfect white wolf ref
25-12-2021T17:58:31,KeefMcDerpface,hah
25-12-2021T17:58:41,ShamusTheFox,"I'm trying to catch up on shows over the holidays. Seen all of Aggretsuko season 4, Masters of the Universe Revelation, and now I am working on Jojo Golden Wind."
25-12-2021T17:59:24,KaplanSektyPieczarek,"cave Keith, Basitin Holidays, Sailor Laura, and Bearskin Raine"
25-12-2021T17:59:42,ProsePro7,I've been catching up on One Piece.  Started at CH1 a few months ago and now I am at CH 903.  Just 102 CHs to go
25-12-2021T17:59:51,ShamusTheFox,GOOD LUCK
25-12-2021T17:59:56,KeefMcDerpface,^
25-12-2021T18:00:08,ShamusTheFox,That show has a crazy number of episodes 
25-12-2021T18:00:16,ProsePro7,I have to say do love the Mink arch once again Furries are everywhere Garuchu
25-12-2021T18:00:27,KaplanSektyPieczarek,One Piece? Never heard of it
25-12-2021T18:00:54,ShamusTheFox,It's like if pirates had superpowers 
25-12-2021T18:01:02,KaplanSektyPieczarek,...
25-12-2021T18:01:08,ShamusTheFox,And nothing made a whole lot of sense
25-12-2021T18:01:20,KaplanSektyPieczarek,I can see that
25-12-2021T18:01:30,ProsePro7,One Piece furries see attached:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8Elu-b0qto
25-12-2021T18:02:07,KaplanSektyPieczarek,"Sorry, I pass"
25-12-2021T18:04:14,KaplanSektyPieczarek,I will be suggesting only one thing in January
25-12-2021T18:04:38,KaplanSektyPieczarek,"Maddie accidentally called Keith ""dad"""
25-12-2021T18:05:16,Roughlandin,That... makes her flirting with him in the earlier chapters SO much weirder
25-12-2021T18:05:20,Roughlandin,...Ick
25-12-2021T18:05:35,TheSexyBeast,Agreed
25-12-2021T18:05:44,ProsePro7,Is she still into him or what?
25-12-2021T18:05:53,ProsePro7,Kinda iffy now
25-12-2021T18:05:53,KaplanSektyPieczarek,She admire him
25-12-2021T18:06:05,Roughlandin,She gave up when she realized he and Natani were an item
25-12-2021T18:06:06,ProsePro7,I duess
25-12-2021T18:06:12,ProsePro7,guess
25-12-2021T18:06:13,KaplanSektyPieczarek,plus we didn't see her father so...
25-12-2021T18:06:13,ShamusTheFox,I have a number of ideas but I don't do patreon. I am paranoid about online payments.
25-12-2021T18:06:29,Roughlandin,I was too at first Shamus
25-12-2021T18:06:37,Rainelover,Is tom streaming tonight?
25-12-2021T18:06:43,KaplanSektyPieczarek,YES
25-12-2021T18:06:45,Roughlandin,Later tonight Raine
25-12-2021T18:06:47,ProsePro7,late
25-12-2021T18:06:53,Rainelover,K
25-12-2021T18:06:59,Roughlandin,He had a Holiday function to go to today
25-12-2021T18:07:01,InTheLionsDen,8-9 pm EST possibly
25-12-2021T18:07:10,Sammit,Hi Lions
25-12-2021T18:07:11,KaplanSektyPieczarek,back to the Maddie and Keith
25-12-2021T18:07:23,InTheLionsDen,o/ Sammit
25-12-2021T18:07:27,ShamusTheFox,Some of the ideas: Maeve said a swear word in Keidran. Adira overhears and forces her to bite down on a bar of soap as punishment a la Christmas Story.
25-12-2021T18:07:33,Roughlandin,Implying they're related still makes things REALLY weird in retrospect. Just saying
25-12-2021T18:07:36,KaplanSektyPieczarek,Maddie can see him as a father figure
25-12-2021T18:08:41,ProsePro7,Think of it more like accidentally calling your teacher mom Rough
25-12-2021T18:08:50,ShamusTheFox,"Another idea: Keith is about to receive a mortal wound, but ghost Laura is able to intervene and stop the blow with her spectral form."
25-12-2021T18:09:31,TheSexyBeast,😒
25-12-2021T18:10:07,Roughlandin,All I'm saying is that implying Maddie subconsciously views Keith as a father figure AND she would flirt with him is implying a LOT of stuff I don't think Tom intended for Maddie's character 
25-12-2021T18:11:10,KaplanSektyPieczarek,"wait, when she was flirting with Keith"
25-12-2021T18:11:13,KaplanSektyPieczarek,?
25-12-2021T18:11:21,TheSexyBeast,Yes
25-12-2021T18:11:25,ShamusTheFox,I am eager to see what happens with Reni. Things are definitely dangerous.
25-12-2021T18:11:35,Roughlandin,Several times up until she realized Keith and Natani were together
25-12-2021T18:12:07,Roughlandin,"When she sees Keith an Nat touching tails and says ""Oh!"" is when she stopped the flirting"
25-12-2021T18:12:27,ShamusTheFox,She knows her boundaries.
25-12-2021T18:12:40,KaplanSektyPieczarek,I think it was only Nat's paranoia
25-12-2021T18:13:26,KaplanSektyPieczarek,"And that ""Oh!""? He just saw that Keith is a gay"
25-12-2021T18:13:27,Roughlandin,No Maddie definitely hit on Keith several times
25-12-2021T18:13:41,KaplanSektyPieczarek,or at least she though that
25-12-2021T18:13:45,ProsePro7,But did that stick when she saw the tail touching cause I think she just gave up cause she thought Keith was gay
25-12-2021T18:14:01,ShamusTheFox,She saw the fight between Keith and the Basitin guard and was impressed.
25-12-2021T18:14:54,ShamusTheFox,"I'm gonna duck out for food, be back later."
25-12-2021T18:15:14,KaplanSektyPieczarek,Basitins are mostly soldiers. Everyone could be impressed if some outcast beat a royal guard
25-12-2021T18:15:26,KaplanSektyPieczarek,ohe was a royal guard right?
25-12-2021T18:15:32,KaplanSektyPieczarek,*he
25-12-2021T18:18:09,Roughlandin,https://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/747/
25-12-2021T18:18:22,Roughlandin,She was thinking about him with hearts around her on this page
25-12-2021T18:18:41,Roughlandin,"""Keith and I are going to be very close"""
25-12-2021T18:18:43,Roughlandin,Brb
25-12-2021T18:18:51,KaplanSektyPieczarek,Nat-o-vision
25-12-2021T18:19:09,ProsePro7,Back when she was playing the kid role
25-12-2021T18:19:10,KaplanSektyPieczarek,plus she was still acting like a child
25-12-2021T18:31:10,Combak,So... No stream today?
25-12-2021T18:31:16,Combak,I assume it was yesterday?
25-12-2021T18:31:31,KeefMcDerpface,It's gonna be late.
25-12-2021T18:32:32,ProsePro7,For a very important date?
25-12-2021T18:32:46,ProsePro7,@Combak Its later tonight
25-12-2021T18:32:48,KeefMcDerpface,:rabbit2:
25-12-2021T18:37:35,ZapiliDver,Hi Combak
25-12-2021T18:38:16,Sammit,Hi Combak
25-12-2021T18:38:20,Combak,"Ah, cool. What was yesterday's stream? Or does Picarto shorten anything between 24-47 hours to yesterday?"
25-12-2021T18:38:32,Combak,"Hi Prose, Zapili, Sammit."
25-12-2021T18:38:39,KeefMcDerpface,Was there a stream yesterday?
25-12-2021T18:38:44,KeefMcDerpface,I know Sage streamed.
25-12-2021T18:39:28,ProsePro7,I dont think so I follow Sage on Twitter and I didnt see a post for a stream
25-12-2021T18:41:26,TheSexyBeast,👋 Comb
25-12-2021T18:46:49,Roughlandin,Sage streamed yesterday
25-12-2021T18:47:39,Roughlandin,And Tom streamed the new comic page Friday night but it rolled just past midnight
25-12-2021T18:47:50,Roughlandin,So that's why the video is showing the date as yesterday
25-12-2021T18:47:57,KeefMcDerpface,ah
25-12-2021T18:52:51,ProsePro7,If he starts now it is gonna be a really late stream
25-12-2021T18:53:12,Roughlandin,Tom said yesterday stream would start at 8-9est
25-12-2021T18:53:22,KaplanSektyPieczarek,Hey @Roughlandin!
25-12-2021T18:53:25,Roughlandin,He had a holiday function to attend today
25-12-2021T18:54:01,Roughlandin,Hi again Kap
25-12-2021T18:54:21,KaplanSektyPieczarek,let's make a bet
25-12-2021T18:54:30,Roughlandin,Not really a betting bear
25-12-2021T18:54:40,KaplanSektyPieczarek,hear me out
25-12-2021T18:54:50,KaplanSektyPieczarek,I'm gonna ask Tom if Maddie had a crush on Keith
25-12-2021T18:55:16,Roughlandin,He'd be the one to ask
25-12-2021T18:55:53,Combak,Hi Beast.
25-12-2021T18:55:57,KaplanSektyPieczarek,"if you're right, I will suggest anything you want in the first week of January"
25-12-2021T18:56:20,KaplanSektyPieczarek,If I'm right...
25-12-2021T18:56:24,KaplanSektyPieczarek,nothing
25-12-2021T18:56:45,KaplanSektyPieczarek,the feel of victory is enough for me
25-12-2021T18:56:52,KaplanSektyPieczarek,soooo.... deal?
25-12-2021T18:57:21,Roughlandin,"You can suggest anything you want anyway, Kap. I can't stop you from what you want to suggest lol"
25-12-2021T18:57:32,KaplanSektyPieczarek,it's just a silly bet
25-12-2021T18:57:44,KaplanSektyPieczarek,plus my I'm out of ideas....
25-12-2021T18:57:48,Roughlandin,"If you want to do that Keith and Maddie suggestion, go right ahead"
25-12-2021T18:58:00,KaplanSektyPieczarek,"alright, no bet"
25-12-2021T18:58:23,Roughlandin,I have a hard enough time coming up with my own suggestions haha
25-12-2021T18:58:43,Roughlandin,"Hence ""Trace Eating Pretzels"" :croughlandin-TracePretzel2:"

25-12-2021T18:59:45,KaplanSektyPieczarek,probably
25-12-2021T18:59:58,Roughlandin,"It's probably going to be another 1-2 hours, Kap"
25-12-2021T19:00:11,KaplanSektyPieczarek,I'm out

25-12-2021T19:46:39,Glassan,Natani's attempt on the gift tag. Adira's gift of White Wolf Wine...
25-12-2021T19:47:26,Mediawatcher37,I’m guessing the nibbly push is for sythe
