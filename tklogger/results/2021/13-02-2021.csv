13-02-2021T16:42:22,SpazztasticKiwi,but the husband had had a vasectomy 10 years ago
13-02-2021T16:42:24,CrRAR,oh
13-02-2021T16:42:29,Ordithus,link the colored one bro https://www.deviantart.com/twokinds/art/Scarlet-Shopping-Day-752924187
13-02-2021T16:42:31,Roughlandin,That's... not usually good
13-02-2021T16:42:35,CrRAR,this sounds complicated xD
13-02-2021T16:42:40,Roughlandin,And vasectomies don't always take
13-02-2021T16:42:48,ProsePro7,^
13-02-2021T16:42:50,ZapiliDver,lol
13-02-2021T16:42:52,CrimsonQuill086,Uh oh...
13-02-2021T16:43:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Red X Sythe is top tier
13-02-2021T16:43:06,Roughlandin,"Ord, King of links!"
13-02-2021T16:43:08,ZapiliDver,top lewd tier
13-02-2021T16:43:17,ProsePro7,Bad operation might make it just end up where the likely hood is very low not completely eliminated
13-02-2021T16:43:20,SpazztasticKiwi,so they find out she‚Äôs had 4 affairs because a tumor in her chest has bee producing proteins that are going to her brain and reducing her inhibitions
13-02-2021T16:43:26,Roughlandin,Zap. Don't get bapped
13-02-2021T16:43:33,CrRAR,wow
13-02-2021T16:43:37,Roughlandin,Huh
13-02-2021T16:43:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt see how that is a thing that can happen
13-02-2021T16:44:05,CrRAR,"case of ""bad luck saving you from worst luck"" situation"
13-02-2021T16:44:06,ProsePro7,That sounds like the case where a guy claimed to be turned gay by a car crash
13-02-2021T16:44:17,ZapiliDver,but [database error] x {Sythe] is pure lewdness....
13-02-2021T16:44:17,Ordithus,"maybe a brain tumor, i dunno. but that sounds far fetched"
13-02-2021T16:44:17,ProsePro7,Seriously
13-02-2021T16:44:25,Roughlandin,I mean it could be a factor. But no biochemical is going to go out and MAKE you have an affair
13-02-2021T16:44:35,Ordithus,zap don't be talking lewd
13-02-2021T16:44:39,ZapiliDver,ok
13-02-2021T16:45:23,CrRAR,I mean if something affects brain chemistry or functioning weird things can happen
13-02-2021T16:45:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"the story goes that if someone made a pass at her, she couldn‚Äôt stop herself because the tumor was suppressing normal self control"
13-02-2021T16:45:47,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs breaking my brain
13-02-2021T16:46:11,CrRAR,"I mean it's possible, frontal lobes are responsible for simple reasoning and such"
13-02-2021T16:46:11,CrimsonQuill086,Well you said it was 'rooted in truth'
13-02-2021T16:46:11,Ordithus,did she also see any food and instantly have to eat it?
13-02-2021T16:46:32,Roughlandin,I don't know enough about brain chemistry and neuroscience to refute it
13-02-2021T16:46:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"food wasn‚Äôt mentioned but she was spending alot of their money because every ad she saw, she donated"
13-02-2021T16:46:46,CrimsonQuill086,"Which basically means that, while there might be some basis of fact...it's more likely that the writers of whatever that is might've taken a few creative liberties."
13-02-2021T16:47:07,CrRAR,I think people get shorter tempers a lot with injury to frontal lobes
13-02-2021T16:47:23,CrimsonQuill086,"But there could be something with the Hypothalmus (that tiny part of our brain which controls self-control with food, sex and other things"
13-02-2021T16:47:46,Roughlandin,That's what happens in a lot of traumatic sports head injuries
13-02-2021T16:48:16,Roughlandin,The frontal lobe gets damaged and impulse/mood control go wonky
13-02-2021T16:48:24,CrRAR,yup!
13-02-2021T16:48:33,TheSexyBeast,"Hypothalamus, you say? ü§î"
13-02-2021T16:48:38,Roughlandin,They say that's what happened to Mike Tyson
13-02-2021T16:48:47,CrRAR,and OJ probably
13-02-2021T16:48:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"they were making it super dramatic how the husband was having a tough time with his wife‚Äôs newfound disloyalty like it was strange for him to be shaken about it, tumor at fault or not"
13-02-2021T16:48:49,ZapiliDver,"Damn, i've quit smoking for two weeks and now fully uderstand instincts...."
13-02-2021T16:48:59,TheSexyBeast,I like food. I like sex.
13-02-2021T16:49:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,tmi
13-02-2021T16:49:11,ZapiliDver,"Food, sex, smoking..."
13-02-2021T16:49:16,Roughlandin,Kids
13-02-2021T16:49:18,CrRAR,lol
13-02-2021T16:49:19,ZapiliDver,Hi Marv
13-02-2021T16:49:21,Roughlandin,PG-13 please
13-02-2021T16:49:30,CrimsonQuill086,Yes
13-02-2021T16:49:36,CrimsonQuill086,This is a sacred chat
13-02-2021T16:49:39,ZapiliDver,Hi Beast
13-02-2021T16:49:48,TheSexyBeast,I like booze. And ice cream. And coffee.
13-02-2021T16:50:04,CrimsonQuill086,"Our lord and Saviour Tom of the Fischbachs shall strike us down with his many moderators, should we abuse his power"
13-02-2021T16:50:11,TheSexyBeast,Hey Zap
13-02-2021T16:50:18,SpazztasticKiwi,age can also effect those impulses because of growth and hormones
13-02-2021T16:50:43,CrRAR,tru
13-02-2021T16:50:49,CrimsonQuill086,The human body is a complicated and volatile chemical cocktail.
13-02-2021T16:50:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I learned why teenage boys can wear shorts in negative degrees
13-02-2021T16:50:56,Roughlandin,True. The brain doesn't stop growing till you're in your twenties
13-02-2021T16:51:02,Roughlandin,That's why teens are... kinda dumb
13-02-2021T16:51:10,ZapiliDver,"Just break some bad habbit, that you have for a\ 20 years..."
13-02-2021T16:51:12,CrimsonQuill086,Has anyone ever heard of the case of Phineas Gage?
13-02-2021T16:51:17,Ordithus,and then once you're 30 you're slowly dying :D
13-02-2021T16:51:27,CrRAR,thinkin thoughts
13-02-2021T16:51:30,CrRAR,makin connections
13-02-2021T16:51:42,CrRAR,brains do brain things
13-02-2021T16:51:55,SpazztasticKiwi,the age that cells start dying faster than they‚Äô replenished is ~24/25
13-02-2021T16:52:05,Roughlandin,Gage is the guy who took a railroad spike through the head and came out with a completely different personality
13-02-2021T16:52:11,CrimsonQuill086,"Phineas Gage basically had his entire personality changed after surviving an accident, wherein a piece of Railway Spike punctured his brain."
13-02-2021T16:52:15,CrimsonQuill086,"Yes, exactly Rough"
13-02-2021T16:52:17,Roughlandin,Yup
13-02-2021T16:52:18,CrRAR,yeah he got quite irritable
13-02-2021T16:52:37,CrRAR,frontal lobes were involved
13-02-2021T16:52:39,CrimsonQuill086,"I read about him in my Dad's ""The Truth is Out there-X Files"" book when I was 12"
13-02-2021T16:52:41,TheSexyBeast,"My worldview changed around 25, and I suddenly thought: how did I make it this far after all the stupid stuff I did a few years ago?"
13-02-2021T16:53:03,SpazztasticKiwi,there was a boy I saw who‚Äôs story was he was skateboarding.....then woke up days later in the hospital missing part of his skull
13-02-2021T16:53:04,CrimsonQuill086,"@TheSexyBeast That's the question that most of us have, Beast..."
13-02-2021T16:53:17,CrRAR,no time like the present
13-02-2021T16:53:52,CrimsonQuill086,"""Then there was the bite of '87...yeah...i-it's amazing that the human body can live without it's frontal lobe...y'know..."""
13-02-2021T16:54:01,ZapiliDver,"part of a skull is a ba thing, but missing two legs by the same idiotic ideas...."
13-02-2021T16:54:31,TheSexyBeast,BRB
13-02-2021T16:54:36,SpazztasticKiwi,the weird part is nobody knows how he got to the hospital
13-02-2021T16:54:42,CrimsonQuill086,Okay Beast
13-02-2021T16:55:04,Roughlandin,Magic skateboard?
13-02-2021T16:55:10,ZapiliDver,"yeah, but then you know, why your friend missing both legs... is really bad"
13-02-2021T16:55:24,SpazztasticKiwi,he was hit by a car - should‚Äôve died - but somehow someone took him to the er
13-02-2021T16:55:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"nobody saw whoever it was and the kid doesn‚Äôt remember walking in himself, if he‚Äôd even been able to"
13-02-2021T16:55:58,CrRAR,good samaritan?
13-02-2021T16:55:59,ZapiliDver,"just a stupid ""can you jump it front of a train""..."
13-02-2021T16:56:11,Roughlandin,Or the hit and run driver dumped him
13-02-2021T16:56:17,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah that‚Äôll do it
13-02-2021T16:56:34,BadFoMo,@Roughlandin That's what I was thinking.
13-02-2021T16:56:38,CrimsonQuill086,Jeepers...that's actually quite scary.
13-02-2021T16:56:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"but he woke up, he‚Äôs recently gotten a replacement plate to go where the skull he lost was"
13-02-2021T16:56:50,Roughlandin,Don't mess around near train tracks. They used to show us a terrifying PSA about that in school
13-02-2021T16:57:13,SpazztasticKiwi,and he has no ill effects either
13-02-2021T16:57:13,Ordithus,and wear your seatbelt!
13-02-2021T16:57:14,ZapiliDver,"But mine friend got only ""Sorry, but you can't walk anymore"""
13-02-2021T16:57:31,SpazztasticKiwi,he can still talk walk and see and hear
13-02-2021T16:57:34,ProsePro7,I love it when Nostalgia Critic does PSA commercials they are always so messed up
13-02-2021T16:57:56,SpazztasticKiwi,they don‚Äôt fully know how he survived
13-02-2021T16:58:20,ZapiliDver,"Yeah, he is still alive, buth what hell is a live without legs, when your are 20 year old...."
13-02-2021T16:58:33,ProsePro7,Damn
13-02-2021T16:58:39,Roughlandin,"That really sucks, Zap. Positive vibes to your friend"
13-02-2021T16:58:51,BadFoMo,Sorry.
13-02-2021T16:59:18,CrimsonQuill086,"My sympathies with your friend, Zap..."
13-02-2021T16:59:20,ProsePro7,At least he survived I know more than one person who didnt.  It sucks
13-02-2021T16:59:57,SpazztasticKiwi,like that girl who took her seat belt off for just a second because it was bothering her shoulder
13-02-2021T17:00:11,SpazztasticKiwi,on her way to a horse jumping competition
13-02-2021T17:00:21,SpazztasticKiwi,she immediately hit a bump and flipped the car
13-02-2021T17:00:26,SpazztasticKiwi,paralyzed
13-02-2021T17:00:37,CrimsonQuill086,We got lucky once.
13-02-2021T17:00:46,CrimsonQuill086,Car flipped over on a bit of oil.
13-02-2021T17:01:04,CrimsonQuill086,It flipped over on it's roof and landed on it's side.
13-02-2021T17:01:06,Roughlandin,Stream start!

13-02-2021T17:05:24,Roughlandin,Deer on the road are a fact of life in my area. Also possums and raccoons.
13-02-2021T17:05:27,MarkovPolo,I'm yet to hit anything with my car except a metal wall

13-02-2021T17:15:03,HeresyArtStream,(probably won't but that's my favorite this round)

13-02-2021T17:15:21,CrimsonQuill086,"I see a suggestion for ""Queen of the Pirates"" vs Queen of Greed."
13-02-2021T17:15:41,ZapiliDver,#1 in list for me

13-02-2021T17:16:21,Roughlandin,I THINK it's referring to Captain Jenny. Not sure though

13-02-2021T17:16:40,BadFoMo,What is the Minecraft one even supposused to be?
13-02-2021T17:16:42,CrimsonQuill086,@Roughlandin There were other pirates such as Anne Bonny and Mary Reed.
13-02-2021T17:16:45,CrimsonQuill086,Reid
13-02-2021T17:16:59,CrimsonQuill086,But I would consider Gr√°inne Mhaol to be the Pirate Queen.
