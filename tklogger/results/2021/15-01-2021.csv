15-01-2021T00:06:39,CrRAR,yerp
15-01-2021T00:06:47,CrRAR,omnipoll took a toll
15-01-2021T00:07:11,CrRAR,s'okay
15-01-2021T00:07:40,SageSaga,Ron cant work and interact with chat at the same time :P

15-01-2021T00:07:51,Nekonny,its hereeeee
15-01-2021T00:08:08,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-sleepoverA:
15-01-2021T00:08:12,Nekonny,this is the practice scent I'm doing
15-01-2021T00:08:21,Nekonny,"well, I would liek to do it again"
15-01-2021T00:08:27,Nekonny,the colum I remade like 4 times
15-01-2021T00:08:31,Nekonny,I'm still slow
15-01-2021T00:08:41,Nekonny,but its looking better and with less bugs
15-01-2021T00:09:32,CrRAR,cool
15-01-2021T00:09:42,SageSaga,repeating the entire scene from scratch is really helpful for memorizing all the tools and what they do and how to do things
15-01-2021T00:10:47,Nekonny,^ this
15-01-2021T00:18:46,Nekonny,can... can I apply a normal to the entire mesh?
15-01-2021T00:18:53,Nekonny,or would it have to be per material?
15-01-2021T00:19:19,Nekonny,I'm thinking its per material...
15-01-2021T00:19:25,Nekonny,what a shame
15-01-2021T00:19:56,CrRAR,looks nice
15-01-2021T00:22:15,SageSaga,cant you just have one and instance it over an area?
15-01-2021T00:22:44,SageSaga,this is a think i know programs like blender can do - i just dont know how to do them- its been so many years
15-01-2021T00:23:06,SageSaga,but i know that you can have a single model be replicated over and over however you want
15-01-2021T00:23:14,Nekonny,probably
15-01-2021T00:23:19,Nekonny,not sure how to do that though
15-01-2021T00:23:39,Nekonny,this is just me wanting to see how it looks
15-01-2021T00:30:01,Nekonny,"well, thats enough of me tourtureing myself dfor one day ^"""

15-01-2021T01:01:07,CrRAR,Like... in the past
15-01-2021T01:01:35,CrRAR,or I guess responsibilities you’ve slowly taken on more
15-01-2021T01:01:39,SpazztasticKiwi,no more “*poof* what do you need? *poof* what do you need? *poof* what do you need?”
15-01-2021T01:02:05,SageSaga,Micheal Jackson paid a person to anesthetize him so he could sleep sometimes

15-01-2021T01:02:36,CrRAR,not good sleep tho ;-;
15-01-2021T01:02:39,SpazztasticKiwi,yep and for a little extra you can make it permanent

15-01-2021T01:16:15,CrRAR,\o/
15-01-2021T01:16:37,Ordithus,don't answer any calls Tuesday

15-01-2021T01:19:29,SpazztasticKiwi,they could still ask me to do a shift Tuesday
15-01-2021T01:20:11,SpazztasticKiwi,but then they’d have to leave me off Thursday cause that would make it six days in a row that I worked
15-01-2021T01:20:15,CrRAR,day AFTER the actual holiday? Sure does sound like a trap
15-01-2021T01:20:28,CrRAR,ah
15-01-2021T01:22:08,AspiringNoodle,state law regarding days worked and overtime?
15-01-2021T01:22:16,AspiringNoodle,Or just standard in excess of 40 hours?
15-01-2021T01:22:31,SpazztasticKiwi,after 40 is overtime
15-01-2021T01:23:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"and considering the base pay raise we already got, they try keeping everyone  at 30-35"
15-01-2021T01:23:39,SageSaga,hmm does that look ok?
15-01-2021T01:23:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"and besides certain circumstances, no 7 days in a row"
15-01-2021T01:23:49,CrRAR,Spectacular!

15-01-2021T01:24:48,Ordithus,hmm the red on the linework is pretty cool. sharpens it up a lot

15-01-2021T03:09:49,sunblaze,the only skill he is missing is deploying tiny turrents and hide behind them repairing them

15-01-2021T03:22:00,AspiringNoodle,"Okay Sage, serious question"
15-01-2021T03:22:41,SageSaga,?
15-01-2021T03:22:46,AspiringNoodle,Let's say you're facing a spellcaster opponent who can cast mind control
15-01-2021T03:23:06,AspiringNoodle,Could it work if you were dealing with someone as smart as an OG Fallout character with 1 intelligence?
15-01-2021T03:23:57,BadFoMo,"""Re-tar-ded? Poo!"""
15-01-2021T03:23:58,SageSaga,if the spellcaster was trying to mind control a 1int OG Fallout character?
15-01-2021T03:24:05,AspiringNoodle,yeah
15-01-2021T03:24:11,AspiringNoodle,"You know, the meme worthy intelligent one xD"
15-01-2021T03:24:20,SageSaga,yeah-
15-01-2021T03:25:10,SageSaga,i mean- mind control spells dont target intelligence
15-01-2021T03:25:14,SpaceCadety,My guess is they'd be too stupid to realize they're being controlled.
15-01-2021T03:25:29,AspiringNoodle,"The Wisdom stat, yeah?"
15-01-2021T03:25:49,SageSaga,yeah its wisdom based save
15-01-2021T03:25:59,AspiringNoodle,"Soooo, I guess small change then xD"
15-01-2021T03:26:04,AspiringNoodle,1 int / 1 wis
15-01-2021T03:26:32,AspiringNoodle,Though I guess the better question is: Would they even WANT to control someone that stupid?
15-01-2021T03:26:57,SageSaga,yes it would work- and they would only have issues with it if they were using the mundane version
15-01-2021T03:27:26,SageSaga,but the more powerful form of mind control lets you assume direct control - so it would be like piloting a person
15-01-2021T03:27:33,SageSaga,their stats wouldnt matter for that
15-01-2021T03:27:47,SageSaga,but if you are issuing commands- thats where your silly antics come up
15-01-2021T03:28:04,AspiringNoodle,"That sounds like a fun time, lol"
15-01-2021T03:28:12,SageSaga,and it would probably be a horrible thing to control such a creature
15-01-2021T03:28:34,AspiringNoodle,-10 intelligence loss for the caster
15-01-2021T03:28:43,AspiringNoodle,"Errr, wisdom"
15-01-2021T03:28:49,AspiringNoodle,Is MC cast with int or wis?
15-01-2021T03:28:51,SageSaga,it wouldnt do that to the caster
15-01-2021T03:28:53,SpaceCadety,"Either way, if your goal is to cause problems for someone, mind controlling the idiot would be a decent way to get it done."
15-01-2021T03:29:23,AspiringNoodle,"Because I'm just imagining that by taking direct control of something so stupid, you yourself would lose mental ability as a result"
15-01-2021T03:29:25,SageSaga,The D&D mind control spell is Dominate Person and its available for most casters in some form
15-01-2021T03:29:46,SageSaga,no you control them like a puppet
15-01-2021T03:29:53,SageSaga,their mental stats stop mattering
15-01-2021T03:30:00,AspiringNoodle,"Ah, okay"
15-01-2021T03:30:06,SpaceCadety,"Idiot breaks something, who will think they're mind controlled and not just being an idiot as usual."
15-01-2021T03:30:33,SageSaga,if you are issuing commands he would do stupid things- if you full control him you are bypassing his brain basically
15-01-2021T03:31:14,AspiringNoodle,I could see full on control being useful in a team fight scenario
15-01-2021T03:31:27,AspiringNoodle,"But if you try doing something more subtle, you might run into issues"
15-01-2021T03:31:51,AspiringNoodle,Ironically because they could be acting smarter than usual :ptv-laugh:
15-01-2021T03:32:14,AspiringNoodle,"""Hey guys... something seems off with Zugzug..."""
15-01-2021T03:32:22,SpaceCadety,"True enough.  In the first case, you'd basically be limited to pointing stupid in the right direction, in the latter you're biggest worry about discovery would be suddenly seeming too intelligent."
15-01-2021T03:32:23,AspiringNoodle,"""He just seems... not as stupid recently."""
15-01-2021T03:33:36,AspiringNoodle,Bleh...

15-01-2021T03:33:55,AspiringNoodle,"Either gonna try to get more of this work done, or go to bed now and wake up early >_>"
15-01-2021T03:34:34,SageSaga,take care sleep well!
15-01-2021T03:34:52,AspiringNoodle,"You'll be finish the page around 3 tomorrow, right?"
15-01-2021T03:35:02,SpaceCadety,See you around.
15-01-2021T03:35:12,AspiringNoodle,Because there's a non-zero chance that might be when I wake up :p
15-01-2021T03:36:23,SageSaga,yeah i will
15-01-2021T03:53:28,SageSaga,all done!

15-01-2021T17:23:11,CrRAR,That’s what the intruders want you to think
15-01-2021T17:24:43,SageSaga,its a useless little thing sometimes- if the night mode turns on it becomes useless
15-01-2021T17:25:32,SageSaga,it has IR lights that it shines out to light up things for the IR mode to see in the dark- unfortunately all that IR light gets reflected right back by the WINDOW GLASS
15-01-2021T17:26:23,SpazztasticKiwi,anyhoo

15-01-2021T21:51:31,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s like around Christmas when that other guy was watching me help another man - following me for a nice 10 minutes before saying something
15-01-2021T21:52:08,SpazztasticKiwi,you ain’t sneaky - I got half a mind to turn around and yell “boo” sometimes to see if they jump
