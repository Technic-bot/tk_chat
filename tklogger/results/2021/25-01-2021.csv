25-01-2021T02:01:25,SonOfGoku,Yes
25-01-2021T02:01:44,AspiringNoodle,(My family has this weird tradition of buy a dozen donuts at Dunkin' when it snows enough to actually pile up)
25-01-2021T02:01:48,SonOfGoku,With hot chocolate?
25-01-2021T02:01:57,AspiringNoodle,But it can't be a light dusting.  It needs to be a few inches
25-01-2021T02:02:17,AspiringNoodle,But we're also planning a pizza order tomorrow... hmmm...

25-01-2021T04:00:28,AspiringNoodle,Hmm...
25-01-2021T04:00:50,AspiringNoodle,Picarto has no winking blep face for animals
25-01-2021T04:01:12,AspiringNoodle,This is a travesty and must be corrected
25-01-2021T04:05:33,Twokinds,"Yeah I figure in the TK world there'd be a set of all standard emoji faces in human, canine, feline, and basitin."
25-01-2021T04:06:00,AspiringNoodle,I wonder if we could get Picarto to give us a winky wolf emote...
25-01-2021T04:06:25,Twokinds,"There's also a limited dragon one. Some people are upset it isn't a full set, but there aren't a lot of dragons, and even less use phones, so... it's not a priority."
25-01-2021T04:06:52,AspiringNoodle,Serious question: Does Nora have an OnlyFans? xD
25-01-2021T04:07:28,Twokinds,OnlyFans does not exist I'
25-01-2021T04:07:39,Twokinds,I'm sure
25-01-2021T04:07:45,AspiringNoodle,Fair enough!
25-01-2021T04:10:51,Twokinds,Also I'm sure she wouldn't be in any need of money.
25-01-2021T04:11:16,Twokinds,"As old as she is, probably one of the richest in the world."

25-01-2021T04:54:58,AspiringNoodle,Welcome to a special kind of Hecc I visit occassionally @w@
25-01-2021T05:24:30,Twokinds,hate that
25-01-2021T05:25:16,Azumachan,Yeah.
25-01-2021T06:01:33,iliar,"Of course, money is a very important point for services like OnlyFans. But I think this is not the only reason. I think some people enjoy popularity."
25-01-2021T06:01:41,iliar,"I thought for a long time what Nora could do in the modern universe. Obviously, she would not do something ordinary like an office worker. It's too boring."
25-01-2021T06:02:00,iliar,"I think Nora likes being in the spotlight. And I think this kind of work would be typical for her. Perhaps this is not OnlyFans, but for example Instagram or something like that."
25-01-2021T06:07:09,SpaceCadety,She'd probably go into showbiz if that's the case.
25-01-2021T06:09:39,SpaceCadety,Also you seem rather un-bot-like for being labelled as a bot account.  Is picarto bugging out?
25-01-2021T06:16:19,iliar,What if I am such a good artificial intelligence that I cannot be distinguished from a human?
25-01-2021T06:16:38,NibblyBot,Squee!
25-01-2021T06:17:36,SpaceCadety,"Actually, she'd probably play wealthy nobility like in the comic.  Avoid serious responsibilities, throw parties, chase magically gifted men."
25-01-2021T06:19:05,SpaceCadety,"Well I guess she'd only chase men, IDK."
25-01-2021T06:20:28,SpaceCadety,I think any AI advanced enough to be indistinguishable from human probably doesn't fit in the bot classification.

25-01-2021T12:30:53,CrRAR,I’ve heard donating blood is the equivalent of burning 650 calories
25-01-2021T12:31:02,CrRAR,I’m sure that varies person to person
25-01-2021T12:45:29,AspiringNoodle,I remember donating blood in High School
25-01-2021T12:45:53,AspiringNoodle,They said the only deficiency with my blood was a lack of iron
25-01-2021T12:45:59,AspiringNoodle,"And I was about as ""big"" then as I am now xd"
25-01-2021T12:46:11,AspiringNoodle,"So I was like, ""really?"" Especially since I loves me meats"

25-01-2021T12:52:13,AspiringNoodle,"Is like, ""No excess blood sugar?  No high cholesterol?  Just... a lack of iron???"""

25-01-2021T12:54:54,AspiringNoodle,Same thing when I got my physical over a year ago
25-01-2021T12:55:09,AspiringNoodle,Only issues were my weight and slightly elevated blood pressure

25-01-2021T21:10:38,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-excited:

25-01-2021T21:11:04,AspiringNoodle,I eat it all c:
25-01-2021T21:11:58,CrRAR,acceptable
25-01-2021T21:12:04,AspiringNoodle,https://twitter.com/i/events/1354156451783036928
25-01-2021T21:12:15,AspiringNoodle,2/4 of these I strongly approve of o3o
25-01-2021T21:12:44,AspiringNoodle,The other 2 I don't know enough about to know how big of a difference it will make
25-01-2021T21:14:19,CrRAR,"Yeah some things might be just more symbolic, but even if done as example/a statement is good leadership for right now."
25-01-2021T21:14:57,CrRAR,"Good thing to make people feel invited to the table, not excluded from it."
25-01-2021T21:15:47,AspiringNoodle,Private prisons needs to die
25-01-2021T21:15:53,AspiringNoodle,And their executives need to foot the bill
25-01-2021T21:38:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Penelope is trying to climb curtains now
25-01-2021T21:39:46,NinoGD,oof
25-01-2021T21:43:14,CrRAR,"Penelope is sweater kitty, right?"
25-01-2021T21:43:46,CrRAR,eye for adventure
25-01-2021T21:43:51,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s no other Penelope that’s been mentioned
25-01-2021T21:45:12,CrRAR,She’s learned she’s cute enough now to get away with destruction
25-01-2021T21:45:35,AspiringNoodle,"Hold on, got a kitty pic on Discord to share"
25-01-2021T21:46:19,CrRAR,It’s a turning point in every kitties life
25-01-2021T21:46:26,AspiringNoodle,Also this:

25-01-2021T22:03:19,SpazztasticKiwi,when do you think it hit him https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/524825976597643265/800834835777454120/image0.png
25-01-2021T22:04:23,AspiringNoodle,Probably *after* trying to open the door
25-01-2021T22:04:26,AspiringNoodle,...several times...
25-01-2021T22:06:06,Ordithus,"it hit him on the face first try, I'm sure"
25-01-2021T22:18:01,CrRAR,home is where the heart is
25-01-2021T22:18:13,CrRAR,no one said anything about the brain
25-01-2021T22:25:23,CrRAR,chocolate. :ccrrar-yis: milk.

25-01-2021T22:35:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m saving $1 by not getting the kindle version of my book
25-01-2021T22:36:22,SpazztasticKiwi,$7 by going online rather than buying at walmart
25-01-2021T22:39:06,CrRAR,"huh, maybe they have a surplus"
25-01-2021T22:39:22,CrRAR,paper books are special
25-01-2021T22:39:30,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-rainehappy::books:
25-01-2021T23:14:22,SpazztasticKiwi,📖
25-01-2021T23:19:41,SpazztasticKiwi,how likely is sdcc this year with vaccines and how covids been going
25-01-2021T23:19:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m thinking....in the negatives
25-01-2021T23:22:43,AspiringNoodle,Unlikely
25-01-2021T23:23:18,AspiringNoodle,"People in positions of power are unrealistically optimistic with both the rate of vaccination, and how many people are willing to get vaccinated"
25-01-2021T23:23:59,AspiringNoodle,"On top of that, new twitter thread pointed out a study regarding case counts should we relax restrictions as early as february"
25-01-2021T23:24:47,AspiringNoodle,"Holding restrictions as long as just March would drastically improve projections, with July being ideal.  But then we also have problems with restrictions screwing over businesses with the gov't giving little to no support"
25-01-2021T23:25:01,SpazztasticKiwi,you ever hear of a rhetorical question
25-01-2021T23:25:36,AspiringNoodle,"Ah yes, forgive me, I must've had my filter on"
25-01-2021T23:28:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I know conventions are still not gonna happened
25-01-2021T23:28:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I figured that when I saw a docu on the spanish flu
25-01-2021T23:28:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"they’re so similar I don’t see this lightening up until 2022, and most likely that’s late 2022"
25-01-2021T23:29:20,AspiringNoodle,"I'm shocked that it's over 100 years later, and masks have once again become political"
25-01-2021T23:29:40,SpazztasticKiwi,and even that’s me being optimistic because we have a change of power
25-01-2021T23:30:11,SpazztasticKiwi,but I don’t see that being enough
25-01-2021T23:30:40,AspiringNoodle,"If we're lucky, COVID will need a sub 50% vaccination rate to achieve herd immunity"
25-01-2021T23:31:00,AspiringNoodle,And anything above that just further hinders it
25-01-2021T23:31:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m glad I waited to try getting a car and moving so could have more cushion money
25-01-2021T23:31:35,SpazztasticKiwi,but now it’s practically impossible because of what it takes to car shop & house....everything
25-01-2021T23:32:50,CrRAR,just little steps
25-01-2021T23:33:42,CrRAR,It does take getting mentally pyched up a bit for either
25-01-2021T23:34:00,AspiringNoodle,"My final package of supplies came tonight, a day early, too!"
25-01-2021T23:34:11,CrRAR,woop
25-01-2021T23:34:13,AspiringNoodle,So ima use tomorrow to field test the phone-specific stuff ;)
25-01-2021T23:34:35,AspiringNoodle,The big thing I want to test is if the car charger can give my phone % while the Instacart app is open.
25-01-2021T23:35:00,CrRAR,I would... hope so?
25-01-2021T23:35:06,AspiringNoodle,"Because that app, if not shut off, drains my phone's battery at a rate of 10% an hour while ASLEEP"
25-01-2021T23:35:14,CrRAR,Holy crap
25-01-2021T23:35:33,AspiringNoodle,"With it shut off, I only lose ~2% an hour."
25-01-2021T23:35:53,CrRAR,I could see some car chargers being under powered
25-01-2021T23:35:58,AspiringNoodle,So what I need to find out is how much charge I can expect this thing to put into the phone while I'm driving.
25-01-2021T23:36:10,CrRAR,Is the one you got got good amps?
25-01-2021T23:36:14,CorporalAxolotl,Hi guys
25-01-2021T23:36:18,CorporalAxolotl,gonna go to bed soon
25-01-2021T23:36:25,CrRAR,yo corporal!
25-01-2021T23:36:25,CorporalAxolotl,but just checking in on my stream folx
25-01-2021T23:36:34,AspiringNoodle,"It's a 3A charger, but my phone uses 2A.  But the charger is *supposed* to be compatible with it"
25-01-2021T23:36:35,CrRAR,we here
25-01-2021T23:36:38,CorporalAxolotl,hi crrar
25-01-2021T23:36:42,AspiringNoodle,So it might only push 2A through.
25-01-2021T23:36:46,CorporalAxolotl,huh
25-01-2021T23:36:47,CrRAR,heya
25-01-2021T23:36:52,CorporalAxolotl,wutcha talkin about
25-01-2021T23:37:00,CorporalAxolotl,also hey asp
25-01-2021T23:37:02,AspiringNoodle,I got an amazon delivery~
25-01-2021T23:37:05,CorporalAxolotl,ooooo
25-01-2021T23:37:06,AspiringNoodle,Ima play with it tomorrow <3
25-01-2021T23:37:13,CorporalAxolotl,I just got 5D chess on steam
25-01-2021T23:37:18,CrRAR,More amps is fine the phone will just take what it needs
25-01-2021T23:37:19,CorporalAxolotl,*time to go melt my brain*
25-01-2021T23:37:33,CrRAR,"More is better, the charger will work less hard"
25-01-2021T23:37:39,CorporalAxolotl,my otamatone has an amp plugin thingy
25-01-2021T23:37:42,CorporalAxolotl,idk what you call it
25-01-2021T23:37:44,CorporalAxolotl,line out?
25-01-2021T23:37:44,CrRAR,"Ok, be careful"
25-01-2021T23:37:50,AspiringNoodle,"But yeah, more or less I need to see if my phone will actually recharge my battery, or if it'll just slow down the drain."
25-01-2021T23:37:59,AspiringNoodle,charger*
25-01-2021T23:38:38,AspiringNoodle,"I would *like* to be able to work longer if possible, it'd be a bummer if there was a hard cap on how much time I can spend doing deliveries before having to stop :c"
25-01-2021T23:39:04,CrRAR,Yeah that would be lame
25-01-2021T23:39:34,AspiringNoodle,"That said, the bright side is that this charger is meant for newer devices"
25-01-2021T23:39:45,AspiringNoodle,"So if I have to buy a new phone, I won't need to buy a new charger, as well <3"
25-01-2021T23:40:12,CrRAR,yeah
25-01-2021T23:41:48,Ordithus,"good luck with the new gig, noodle!"
25-01-2021T23:42:05,Ordithus,hope you like it and it pays :ctwokinds-adiracoin:
25-01-2021T23:42:09,AspiringNoodle,I learned that apparently I don't need to be super specific about the miles I drive
25-01-2021T23:42:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I missed something there
25-01-2021T23:43:02,AspiringNoodle,"Supposedly when you deduct business miles from your taxes, you need to include things like date, start / end address, and total distance"
25-01-2021T23:43:14,AspiringNoodle,Buuuuuuut that'd be super inconvenient for delivery drivers ^^;
25-01-2021T23:45:46,AspiringNoodle,About the phone car charger?
25-01-2021T23:46:34,SpazztasticKiwi,time skipped 4 minutes
25-01-2021T23:46:54,AspiringNoodle,Darn time-space anomalies
