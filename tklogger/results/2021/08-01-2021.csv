08-01-2021T00:37:24,Kameloh,okay yeah I was definitely thinking of the 3d one XD

08-01-2021T00:37:31,iliar,"First, people had a problem with color standards. Have you tried playing Dr. Mario without colors? Well, the Russian kids didn't know it was supposed to be color, but they still tried to play it."

08-01-2021T00:40:25,Dadrobit,"Exile, Escape Velocity, Star Castle, and a bunch of old cabinet game ports"
08-01-2021T00:41:23,SageSaga,oh yeah! a few weeks ago my father asked me-
08-01-2021T00:42:06,NezumiYuki,@Dadro... Escape Velocity?  By Ambrosia Games?   Dang I used to binge on that old Mac game like crazy.  xD
08-01-2021T00:42:14,SageSaga,"""What do you remember about the commadore 64?"" and i said ""I remember you wouldnt let me play a bards tale!"" and he said ""YOU COULDNT READ!"""
08-01-2021T00:42:25,Dadrobit,One and the same! Loved that game!
08-01-2021T00:42:26,TLDragon,"another super old game I enjoyed was the gorilla game. Forget its proper name, but you were a pair of king kongs flinging ballistic missile bananas at each other."

08-01-2021T00:42:38,FenceEqualizer,That’s hilarious Sage
08-01-2021T00:42:42,BadFoMo,I think a lot of my childhood games where from 'The Learning Compiny'. Lego Island was a fun one too.
08-01-2021T00:42:50,FenceEqualizer,:ptv-laugh:
08-01-2021T00:42:54,SageSaga,i actually did learn playing on that thing
08-01-2021T00:43:02,CrRAR,awwww sweet
08-01-2021T00:43:30,SageSaga,but a bards tale had a book that the game referenced so you could read what happened
08-01-2021T00:43:33,NezumiYuki,"I'll have to admit, but Escape Velocity got me into mild coding and Res-Editing to make my own sprites and ships as custom plug-ins.  That game was fun as fuk! <3"
08-01-2021T00:43:36,SageSaga,its how they saved on disc cost
08-01-2021T00:43:43,CrRAR,ah that's cool
08-01-2021T00:43:51,CrRAR,fuel for the imagination though~
08-01-2021T00:43:56,SageSaga,it just told you what page to read for the dialogue and stuff and then let you choose stuff
08-01-2021T00:44:08,SageSaga,it was like a computer game lead choose your own adventure
08-01-2021T00:44:17,KeefMcDerpface,Interesting.
08-01-2021T00:44:18,CrRAR,"the game is more than the game, it lives in your heart and in your mind~"
08-01-2021T00:44:21,NezumiYuki,"Sounds cool, Sage!"
08-01-2021T00:44:28,TLDragon,the book was also as an antipriacy measure
08-01-2021T00:44:36,CrRAR,haha true TL
08-01-2021T00:45:04,Kameloh,I think I remember playing a bunch of MUD games to learn how to read/type fast :eyes:
08-01-2021T00:45:07,SageSaga,who would have pirated back then? there was no internet-
08-01-2021T00:45:11,CrRAR,^
08-01-2021T00:45:13,TLDragon,"""quick, what's it say on the third paragraph of page 30?"" Now we have google, but back then? good fucking luck."

08-01-2021T00:47:19,BadFoMo,LGR has a cool video on old school DRM.
08-01-2021T00:47:23,Dadrobit,Sorry not sorry :D
08-01-2021T00:47:37,SageSaga,the floppy disk had more space on it than it had memory
08-01-2021T00:47:42,SageSaga,and it didnt come with a HDD
08-01-2021T00:48:05,SageSaga,so you couldnt copy without having a second drive- which is waaay more expensive than just buying the game-
08-01-2021T00:48:30,Ordithus,what a world it was
08-01-2021T00:48:34,CrRAR,haha
08-01-2021T00:48:35,Dadrobit,Escape Velocity had DRM in the form of an invincible pirate captain that would come and blow you up. You could bypass it though if you got a ship cloaking device!
08-01-2021T00:48:57,iliar,"Secondly, it was impossible to buy original consoles and original games in Russia. Only Chinese counterfeits. Buying a game has always been a lottery. Looking at the cover, in most cases, you could not guess what game you are buying."

08-01-2021T01:26:44,twichdouglas,how are your lines to smooth and how do they perfectly taper off while starting thicc? do u have some kind of stabilizer?
08-01-2021T01:27:46,Ordithus,so much blush
08-01-2021T01:28:14,AspiringNoodle,blush levels reaching critical mass!
08-01-2021T01:28:30,SageSaga,ive got a small amount of stabilization on - but mostly my hand is steady
08-01-2021T01:29:21,twichdouglas,how do you have such a stabile hand? alpha genetics or did you practice like hell to get it steady?
08-01-2021T01:30:17,SageSaga,been drawing since i was able to hold a pencil and been working professionally at it for over 15 years
08-01-2021T01:30:23,SageSaga,so - practice mostly

08-01-2021T01:36:16,BadFoMo,...Wat?
08-01-2021T01:36:57,Dadrobit,o/ keef
08-01-2021T01:37:34,SageSaga,"there's some weirdos with this idea in there head that ""natural talent"" is a thing that makes people great at things- so people who practice hard to get good at something- arent really good at it- they just cheated to get the skill XD"
08-01-2021T01:37:58,Ordithus,"that's like, the opposite of cheating"
08-01-2021T01:38:30,SageSaga,they see it as learning something you shouldnt have
08-01-2021T01:38:55,SageSaga,"only ""true artists"" can draw because they were MADE to draw"

08-01-2021T01:43:06,Dadrobit,Looking into some instrument patches. I'm thinking I'm gonna have to wait until I get home.
08-01-2021T01:44:29,SageSaga,need oldie instruments - that was my big issue T_T couldnt get any of the classic sounds
08-01-2021T01:44:46,SageSaga,cept the Koto- but this isnt an asian theme campaign
08-01-2021T01:44:53,Dadrobit,"Looks like it's maybe ""possible"" in Reaper, but a bit above my experience level."
08-01-2021T01:45:06,SageSaga,then its probably way above mine
08-01-2021T01:45:41,Dadrobit,"Yeah, you probably don't want another 10 page instructions manual lol"
08-01-2021T01:45:58,SageSaga,:P
08-01-2021T01:46:01,SageSaga,thanks for looking though
08-01-2021T01:46:15,SageSaga,guess i just need to try and find some DnD music people

08-01-2021T15:59:30,Hogan,... at least I get this one on Wednesday :D

08-01-2021T16:09:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I just read this story an investigator (cop?) shared online
08-01-2021T16:10:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"his weirdest encounter, he was searching a guy’s house for drugs & apparently the guy ended up being clean but they opened a drawer to find a ~collection~ of women’s underthings"
08-01-2021T16:10:16,SpazztasticKiwi,they were his
08-01-2021T16:10:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"no girlfriend, no wife"
08-01-2021T16:10:31,SageSaga,no kink shaming
08-01-2021T16:10:40,Ordithus,people are weird
08-01-2021T16:10:49,BadFoMo,...Yep.
08-01-2021T16:10:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"I mean if that’s all you find, who really cares"
08-01-2021T16:11:05,SpazztasticKiwi,let the guy be - it hurts noone
08-01-2021T16:12:13,BadFoMo,That just gave me a bad thought. What if thoes were 'trophies'?
08-01-2021T16:12:50,SageSaga,then it would be misleading to say they belonged to him
08-01-2021T16:17:05,SpazztasticKiwi,the guy specifically said he asked the man if his wife would be coming to claim the clothing & the man admitted they were his
08-01-2021T16:17:31,Ordithus,a likely story
08-01-2021T16:17:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I guessed they were trophies when I read the title & they could’ve been & the man lied but who’s to say
08-01-2021T16:18:07,CrRAR,The officer in his report classifed the situation a... brief... encounter.

08-01-2021T16:22:55,SageSaga,you probably shouldnt assume the guy murdered a bunch of women and stole their clothes
08-01-2021T16:23:36,SpazztasticKiwi,who said he went straight to murder
08-01-2021T16:23:40,SageSaga,when the more likely story is he bought them and he probably could prove it since most people like that buy online
08-01-2021T16:23:54,SpazztasticKiwi,dude could’ve just  been a swiper
08-01-2021T16:24:47,SageSaga,yeah- but if they thought that wouldnt they pursue more into the case? Or probably not talk about it so if people started reporting clothes going missing - he would be a target? He probably showed them his ebay purchases
08-01-2021T16:24:53,BadFoMo,I watched a few too many episodes of Forensic Files with my 'friend'; it can't be helped.
08-01-2021T16:25:04,SageSaga,my mother used to sell vintage womens clothing on ebay all the time- it was mostly to men
08-01-2021T16:25:29,CrimsonQuill,urge to kinkshame awakens
08-01-2021T16:26:44,SageSaga,the issue here is- you tell the story- and a bunch of people assume the worse rather than what's more likely
08-01-2021T16:29:39,SageSaga,you are way more likely to live next to someone who has a weird sex kink than you are to be next to a creepy criminal- in most cases- i guess if you lived in an area that was very poor and unstable maybe that would shift a bit XD
08-01-2021T16:30:15,CrimsonQuill,"Well, we all have our...oddities."
08-01-2021T16:30:36,CrimsonQuill,"I admit, I have certain...biases...regarding this sort of topic, owing to my upbringing."
08-01-2021T16:31:17,CrimsonQuill,"But to be honest, it's that person's business. Not mine to intrude on or judge (Within an extent)."
08-01-2021T16:34:21,BadFoMo,That sounds like a healthy mindset.
08-01-2021T16:34:53,SageSaga,i think the parenthesis kinda kills it as healthy
08-01-2021T16:35:27,SpazztasticKiwi,...vintage clothing you say
08-01-2021T16:35:33,SpazztasticKiwi,you have my attention
08-01-2021T16:35:56,CrimsonQuill,@SageSaga It's a knotty problem. I'm very bad with those...

08-01-2021T16:55:03,Ordithus,"well, quill, do you know the character in the last panel this page?"

08-01-2021T16:55:50,SageSaga,it would have been creepy if i told ya exactly where you left off though wouldnt it?
08-01-2021T16:55:51,CrimsonQuill,Wait...the last panel? They kind of look familiar...maybe that redhead's sister or summat? Did she have a sister?
08-01-2021T16:56:03,CrimsonQuill,@SageSaga Indeed it would!
08-01-2021T16:56:07,CrimsonQuill,Aheheheh
08-01-2021T16:56:10,Ordithus,so you have missed a lot
08-01-2021T16:56:14,CrimsonQuill,Yep
08-01-2021T16:56:34,CrimsonQuill,I spent the last three years using Twokinds rereads as an aid to kicking a severe personal habit.
08-01-2021T16:56:40,Ordithus,read eeeeet https://www.artificialincident.com/

08-01-2021T23:23:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw a clip from anastasia so naturally I had to pull up the movie
08-01-2021T23:24:55,CrRAR,"ah, I haven't seen that"
08-01-2021T23:25:15,CrRAR,I probably slightly remember it tho from TV trailers

08-01-2021T23:27:46,CrRAR,the little bat reminds me of a mix between the Ferngully bat and Brain fro Pinky & the Brain
08-01-2021T23:31:55,CrRAR,"Wow, as a wiki indicates, the in-universe lore for those movies says the Ferngully Bat and Bartok are cousins."

08-01-2021T23:39:59,SpazztasticKiwi,the story’s not even real
08-01-2021T23:40:10,CrRAR,I am aware
08-01-2021T23:40:30,SpazztasticKiwi,it was a fairytale until a few years ago when they found anastasia & her sisters
08-01-2021T23:41:24,CrRAR,ah interesting
