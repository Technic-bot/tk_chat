06-02-2021T14:39:01,SpaceCadety,"The ghost of Brutus, still as happy to see Clovis as ever slowly driving Clovis mad?"
06-02-2021T14:39:21,TheSexyBeast,Brutus with angel wings and a harp

06-02-2021T14:42:21,TheSexyBeast,Brutus?
06-02-2021T14:42:42,FenceEqualizer,Ye
06-02-2021T14:43:07,TheSexyBeast,Was he knowingly evil?
06-02-2021T14:43:19,ZapiliDver,HI all!
06-02-2021T14:43:26,FenceEqualizer,He was with the group that was literally chucking fireballs at the town o_o.

06-02-2021T14:46:20,TheSexyBeast,"Tom, was Brutus evil?"
06-02-2021T14:46:41,Roughlandin,I know it's probably dumb... but I'm really hoping Raine or somebody manages to find him before the poison fully works
06-02-2021T14:47:01,AspiringNoodle,I kinda hope we get an explanation of what that ring was
06-02-2021T14:48:49,Twokinds,Brutus is not evil
06-02-2021T14:48:58,SpaceCadety,Rose decides to just teleport his only mostly dead body in front of Trace.
06-02-2021T14:49:31,Roughlandin,...IS not? Hmm...
06-02-2021T14:50:38,TheSexyBeast,"Thought so, thank you Tom"
06-02-2021T14:50:39,SpaceCadety,"Brutus is too... uh, simple... to be evil."
06-02-2021T14:51:07,Roughlandin,"Also, how bad would it mess Clovis up if he finds out Brutus is still alive and has joined Team Legacy?"
06-02-2021T14:51:08,Mediawatcher,"Brutus didn’t have a bad bone in his body, it’s a shame this is how it ended for him"
06-02-2021T14:51:25,Roughlandin,He was just doing his job like a good boy should!
06-02-2021T14:51:42,AspiringNoodle,"Brutus, at worst, is the ""useful idiot"""
06-02-2021T14:51:50,Ordithus,got in with the wrong crowd

06-02-2021T14:51:54,FenceEqualizer,Guess he was just loyal to a fault and became friends with the wrong person.
06-02-2021T14:51:55,Mediawatcher,It looked Brutus died instantly
06-02-2021T14:51:59,Ordithus,makes me wonder his backstory
06-02-2021T14:52:03,Mediawatcher,So yeah he’s gone
06-02-2021T14:52:08,Mediawatcher,Clovis must pay

06-02-2021T14:53:22,Mediawatcher,We have to accept it
06-02-2021T14:53:27,Roughlandin,It ain't over till he's in an urn in Keith's room!

06-02-2021T14:56:48,Xexanoth,*mentally
06-02-2021T14:56:48,FenceEqualizer,Just thought about it. Tom made the right choice to show the comic today. I imagine if he posted this comic on Friday or Saturday his inbox would have been flooded with people changing their submissions.
06-02-2021T14:56:57,ZapiliDver,Nibbly just line do][om

06-02-2021T14:57:46,ZapiliDver,"Rust in pieces, Remus"
06-02-2021T14:57:48,Mediawatcher,They did kind of mention it earlier
06-02-2021T14:58:36,FenceEqualizer,I don't know Rem seems like he wants to listen to his boss. Rom the one with a Murder Boner.
06-02-2021T14:58:59,Roughlandin,Rem is the one who went on his own to chase Sythe
06-02-2021T14:59:05,Roughlandin,Rom is the one doing his job
06-02-2021T14:59:20,TheSexyBeast,Rem = murder boner
06-02-2021T14:59:22,FenceEqualizer,Ahh correction then. Rem is the one with the murder boner.
06-02-2021T14:59:22,Mediawatcher,I wonder how rom will die
06-02-2021T14:59:36,Ordithus,Kat to the face

06-02-2021T15:06:42,Mediawatcher,I think we all agree on that

06-02-2021T15:07:47,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s speciesist
06-02-2021T15:07:57,TheSexyBeast,That reminds me: I'm really glad to see Maddie go from precocious imp to young adult getting over her puritan feelings about the world
06-02-2021T15:09:09,Roughlandin,Honestly I think this is a key development when it comes to Clovis. It's going to make his villainy all the more ruthless and make him break all the harder when his schemes all come crumbling down
06-02-2021T15:09:33,Roughlandin,...Though I'm still holding out hope for a miracle good boy save by Raine

06-02-2021T15:11:03,TheSexyBeast,What are we talking about?
06-02-2021T15:11:06,SpaceCadety,I'd bet more on Rose saving him than Raine.  She's linked to the manor itself after all.
06-02-2021T15:11:11,Roughlandin,Same! Me and Deathclaw! Team miracle save!
06-02-2021T15:12:12,Ordithus,"then he can die again! and a third time, just to be sure"

06-02-2021T15:13:31,ProsePro7,I CALLED IT!
06-02-2021T15:13:34,SpaceCadety,"Oh dear, would Reni saving him lead to a Brutus+Reni ship?"

06-02-2021T15:14:50,ProsePro7,I dont know him walking away after killing him still carries weight and it would be interesting to see Brutus as a good boy struggle with the boss he still loves that tried to kill him
06-02-2021T15:15:24,TheSexyBeast,I think Tom has had this all sketched out for years now.
06-02-2021T15:15:25,Rainelover,"The goodest boy must be saved, I had hope that Clovis could be redeemed through Brutus, but then he pulled a reverse Caesar"
06-02-2021T15:15:45,Roughlandin,And Clovis' reaction to seeing his only friend with his enemies the next time they meet would be priceless

06-02-2021T15:19:54,ProsePro7,If we are at the mid point then Brutus have to live that way we get to know the character and develop an investment in him
06-02-2021T15:20:00,Roughlandin,And I think this is just setting Clovis up as the main foil to the Legacy Gang
06-02-2021T15:20:21,Mediawatcher,"Maybe the poison isn’t instantaneous, but honestly that’s just wishful thinking."
06-02-2021T15:20:26,CrimsonQuill086,Clovis reminds me of the villain from GotG 2. I won't say the name 'cos spoilers.
06-02-2021T15:20:34,Roughlandin,"That's my hope, Media"
06-02-2021T15:20:46,SpazztasticKiwi,it depends what kind of poison is used
06-02-2021T15:20:50,CrimsonQuill086,"A very intimate, very...personal villainy."
06-02-2021T15:20:55,ProsePro7,I still think that Clovis will be more of a Loki character or Vegeta with Brahm being the main villain like Thanos or Freeza
06-02-2021T15:20:55,Roughlandin,"And I know not to put much stock in it, but Tom did say ""Brutus IS not evil"" earlier"
06-02-2021T15:21:07,SpazztasticKiwi,some poisons are ineffective after they expire
06-02-2021T15:21:15,SpazztasticKiwi,some take very little to kill
06-02-2021T15:21:20,Ordithus,:popcorn::cw0lfmare-Paperember:
06-02-2021T15:21:21,SpaceCadety,"Hey, even if it stopped his heart, there's still about 2-3 before brain death."
06-02-2021T15:21:25,Roughlandin,Clovis should have checked the expiration date on his ring
06-02-2021T15:21:33,SpaceCadety,minutes*
06-02-2021T15:21:46,CrimsonQuill086,"Clovis has probably made it so that the death should be 'painless', meaning it'll be a slower acting poison."
06-02-2021T15:21:50,TheSexyBeast,I would caution conflating sketch suggestions and the applied feelings with the actual TK storyline
06-02-2021T15:21:58,CrimsonQuill086,Similar to Socrates taking a few minutes to die from Hemlock.
06-02-2021T15:22:12,CrimsonQuill086,But there is a strong chance also that Brutus is...brutalized for good.
06-02-2021T15:22:17,CrimsonQuill086,For want of a better word.
06-02-2021T15:22:31,ProsePro7,Or cyanide which is instant
06-02-2021T15:22:35,CrimsonQuill086,We shall see.
06-02-2021T15:22:57,CrimsonQuill086,"Theories abound, but in Mekkan, there is only one true god...Tom. And the story is in his hands."
06-02-2021T15:23:09,Roughlandin,I think killing Brutus makes sense plotwise... but I also think having him live and join the Team would be WAY more interesting for their continued interactions with Clovis
06-02-2021T15:23:11,CrimsonQuill086,We can only pray for deliverance from our great benefactor.
06-02-2021T15:23:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"there was once a situation where a controversial group tried death by cyanide but the drug had expired, leaving them alive & giving them food poisoning"
06-02-2021T15:23:27,DarthKeidran,"Remember. Reni said she was going to check the dungeons. If it’s a magic based poison (probably is because it didn’t affect Clovis), Reni may be able to save him."
06-02-2021T15:23:29,ProsePro7,Dont give him more of a complex than he already has Quill HAHA
06-02-2021T15:24:09,CrimsonQuill086,@ProsePro7 You're talking to someone who's spending their spare time making an entire Halo fanfic out of one Raine sketch.
06-02-2021T15:24:28,ProsePro7,I've been right so far so I will make a guess and say that Tom will let Brutus live.  I dont think that he is done with the characters development.  If he kills him now its a mistake
06-02-2021T15:24:51,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s also his comic
06-02-2021T15:24:57,TheSexyBeast,Tom's story to tell
06-02-2021T15:25:01,ProsePro7,Just my opinion
06-02-2021T15:25:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"people may like Brutus, I’m alright with him, but I’m not effected at all in the end about him dying"
06-02-2021T15:25:33,Roughlandin,I know Tom's a good enough storyteller by now that he'll make the right decision for the plot
06-02-2021T15:25:37,Ordithus,musclehead didn't get a lot of character development before he died
06-02-2021T15:25:49,Ordithus,you're stuffing the story into a corner
06-02-2021T15:25:59,SpazztasticKiwi,he wasn’t here enough for me to get too attached
06-02-2021T15:26:07,ProsePro7,Exactly
06-02-2021T15:26:08,SpazztasticKiwi,long enough
06-02-2021T15:26:42,TheSexyBeast,No Annie Wilkes
06-02-2021T15:26:44,Roughlandin,I think there are interesting stories to be told if he dies OR if he lives
06-02-2021T15:27:00,Roughlandin,Both do interesting things to the plot
06-02-2021T15:27:07,SpazztasticKiwi,is it odd to anyone else that the minions are all understandably single
06-02-2021T15:27:09,Roughlandin,...I just want good boy to live
06-02-2021T15:27:23,SpazztasticKiwi,not a one is doing it for the support of a family
06-02-2021T15:27:24,Mediawatcher,Or Brutus could be a posthumous character
06-02-2021T15:27:31,Mediawatcher,Dead but still a part of the story
06-02-2021T15:27:36,Roughlandin,They're all huge sexists. They don't seem the family type
06-02-2021T15:28:13,ProsePro7,I think the next step in the story will be the teams getting split up again but this time they will be mixed
06-02-2021T15:28:43,Mediawatcher,A bit too soon for that
06-02-2021T15:28:45,ProsePro7,Team A and Team B will trade members and go on separate ways until they reunite once more
06-02-2021T15:28:54,Roughlandin,Yeah there's still a lot to go in this arc
06-02-2021T15:29:02,TheSexyBeast,"Young men in search of adventure, Rough"
06-02-2021T15:29:02,SpazztasticKiwi,they’re obviously the real evil or selfishly doing bad to benefit themselves but there’s also the character in some narratives that does bad for the support of others back home due to no other options
06-02-2021T15:29:04,Mediawatcher,I don’t see why they would separate now
06-02-2021T15:29:08,ProsePro7,I agree but that is the end goal I see
06-02-2021T15:29:14,SpazztasticKiwi,yet we’re missing that character in TK
06-02-2021T15:29:21,SpazztasticKiwi,at least that’s what I’ve noticed
06-02-2021T15:29:25,Mediawatcher,Which one?
06-02-2021T15:29:35,ProsePro7,Its hard to tell a story with this many characters without splitting them up.  Like I said just an opinion
06-02-2021T15:29:41,Roughlandin,Carver was just doing this to help his 6 orphaned brothers and sisters
06-02-2021T15:29:53,Roughlandin,...Now nobody looks after them
06-02-2021T15:30:11,ProsePro7,Rough why are you trying to make things even sadder?
06-02-2021T15:30:31,ProsePro7,Is dead Brutus not enough?
06-02-2021T15:30:46,TheSexyBeast,Chill
06-02-2021T15:30:47,ZapiliDver,Just add some Prog Rock to increase saddness level
06-02-2021T15:30:54,SpazztasticKiwi,rom and rem are brothers right
06-02-2021T15:31:01,SpazztasticKiwi,or do they look alike
06-02-2021T15:31:08,Roughlandin,They're twins
06-02-2021T15:31:23,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s what I thought
06-02-2021T15:31:27,CrRAR,famous murder bros.
06-02-2021T15:31:38,Roughlandin,About to be the famously murdered bros
06-02-2021T15:31:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t know why but I keep thinking Brutus has a brother in the story
06-02-2021T15:31:54,ZapiliDver,:grin:
06-02-2021T15:31:57,CrRAR,xD :ok_hand:
06-02-2021T15:31:59,TheSexyBeast,Don't cross the squirrel
06-02-2021T15:32:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"or a family member, a sibling"
06-02-2021T15:32:08,SpazztasticKiwi,but he doesn’t
06-02-2021T15:32:12,Mediawatcher,The twins won’t be here for long
06-02-2021T15:32:20,Mediawatcher,Nibbly will show no mercy
06-02-2021T15:32:32,Roughlandin,"He does have a brother. Clovis' new bodyguard, Dootus"
06-02-2021T15:32:33,Ordithus,"never discussed, spazz. orphans are also the type to end up in a dangerous guild like Clovis's"
06-02-2021T15:32:40,SpazztasticKiwi,imagine: death by squirrel mob
06-02-2021T15:32:49,Roughlandin,The Squeakening
06-02-2021T15:32:51,Ordithus,hence Zen and Natani's desperate lives leading them down their path
06-02-2021T15:33:16,SpazztasticKiwi,such a joyous topic
06-02-2021T15:33:21,Roughlandin,"Clovis: ""All the lonely people... Where do they all come from?"""
06-02-2021T15:33:38,SpazztasticKiwi,it might be Colin I keep thinking about because he and Brutus look similar
06-02-2021T15:33:55,Ordithus,talk about years between kids
06-02-2021T15:34:09,Roughlandin,Both beeg. But one is woof and one is friendly doggy
06-02-2021T15:34:13,TheSexyBeast,Zen and Natani both have huge redemption arcs in this story
06-02-2021T15:34:46,Ordithus,I wouldn't call it redemption
06-02-2021T15:34:54,CrimsonQuill086,Hardly anyone in Twokinds can be considered innocent...many of the characters have redemptive arcs of a sort.
06-02-2021T15:35:18,TheSexyBeast,Basing it off of how they were introduced
06-02-2021T15:35:31,Roughlandin,"The main character is a former genocidist,. So I think ""people can change"" is the main theme lol"
06-02-2021T15:35:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder what Nibbly sees when she looks in a mirror
06-02-2021T15:35:53,Roughlandin,Perfection
06-02-2021T15:36:11,TheSexyBeast,SQUIRREL!
06-02-2021T15:36:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I expected somebody to say “a strong independent squirrel”
06-02-2021T15:36:26,CrimsonQuill086,Tom seems to follow the 'Greek Monomyth'.
06-02-2021T15:36:32,Ordithus,who don't need no wolf
06-02-2021T15:36:38,Ordithus,but likes them
06-02-2021T15:37:05,Mediawatcher,"Nibbly doesn’t  need sythe, but she’s more than happy to have him"
06-02-2021T15:37:06,CrimsonQuill086,"This postulates that the world is inherently broken, and that people are broken too, but that there is always a chance to fix them."
06-02-2021T15:37:27,Mediawatcher,I mean she clearly has a crush on hik
06-02-2021T15:37:32,SpazztasticKiwi,what is Nibbly is really a wolf girl who got in a magic accident that made her a squirrel
06-02-2021T15:37:33,Mediawatcher,Him
06-02-2021T15:37:36,SpazztasticKiwi,if
06-02-2021T15:37:44,CrimsonQuill086,"This contrasts the 'American Monomyth', that postulates that the world is inherently good and corrupted by outside forces, and that what is broken can't be fixed."
06-02-2021T15:38:13,Roughlandin,Nibbs is Laura reincarnated. It's been there all along
06-02-2021T15:38:49,TheSexyBeast,"The TK world might be broken from the start, but it shouldn't be an analog for our world"
06-02-2021T15:40:01,Roughlandin,"No wait. Nibbs is Brutus. When Clovis killed him, his soul went back in time. Now he's stuck in a perpetual time loop until he can find a way to save himself"
06-02-2021T15:40:23,CrimsonQuill086,It's a writing trope I learned from an essay about 'Halo and Heinlein's premise' by Haruspis @TheSexyBeast
06-02-2021T15:41:08,TheSexyBeast,I'll read up on that
06-02-2021T15:41:19,Roughlandin,Everybody give me 500 words on the thematic significance of Brutus
06-02-2021T15:41:25,Ordithus,this nora piece tho <3
06-02-2021T15:41:46,Roughlandin,Pretty Nora. Pretty scenery!
06-02-2021T15:43:10,TheSexyBeast,"All I'm saying is that Tom has this story sketched out, and we should enjoy it without trying to bend it to fit our wishes, hence my reference to Annie Wilkes from 'Misery'."
06-02-2021T15:43:44,TheSexyBeast,I trust him as a storyteller.
06-02-2021T15:43:54,DarthKeidran,"I hope my suggestion makes it in. Tom messaged me asking for clarification and simplification, but Patreon’s message system took the & signs as an attempt to put html in the message. I’m trying for Young Nora and her first mate shortly before “bed time”…"
06-02-2021T15:43:59,CrimsonQuill086,"@TheSexyBeast With that, I agree."

06-02-2021T15:44:43,Roughlandin,Good to see ya
06-02-2021T15:45:24,DarthKeidran,I know. My new work schedule 10:30 - 22:30 makes it much easier to be up in time for the streams.
06-02-2021T15:45:28,ZapiliDver,Hi Darth
06-02-2021T15:45:30,SpazztasticKiwi,that suggestion sounds a bit too much for sketches
06-02-2021T15:46:42,TheSexyBeast,"BTW, beautiful job on the Lakeside Nora sketch Tom."
06-02-2021T15:46:48,Roughlandin,"Eh we've had sketches of Trace and Flora getting ready for ""bed"""
06-02-2021T15:47:03,DarthKeidran,"To be specific. The idea is that if young Nora is Naieve it would be an “expectations versus reality” in expectations, she’s seductively walking towards her mate. In reality, she clumsily trips when asking how “it” works."
06-02-2021T15:47:15,SpazztasticKiwi,shhhh people aren’t supposed to know how babies are made
06-02-2021T15:47:30,Ordithus,"they come from Amazon, right?"
06-02-2021T15:47:33,Roughlandin,Storks. Or for dragons... big... storks
06-02-2021T15:47:34,SpazztasticKiwi,they happen when mommy and daddy love each other vewwy much
06-02-2021T15:47:36,DarthKeidran,"More specifically, she trips if her mate is non-dragon."

06-02-2021T15:49:28,SpazztasticKiwi,your imaginations are too loose to trust with my possible reality
06-02-2021T15:49:38,DarthKeidran,"Basically I’m curious if her first love/reproductive interest was a dragon, human, Keidtan, or Basitin. I’m not asking for more intimate details, but want a funny scenario."

06-02-2021T15:51:41,Roughlandin,A keidran that's spent too much time at the beach
06-02-2021T15:51:48,DarthKeidran,"That’s what I’m wondering. Then again, the “T” is right next to the “R”, so maybe it was my own clumsy fingers."
06-02-2021T15:52:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Fun fact, the Keidran would mostly likely get sun bleached instead of tanned"

06-02-2021T17:44:19,Ordithus,weird
06-02-2021T17:44:23,ThingsAreMoving,Shuffle the playlist manually and switch the randomizer off. That's how I play my stuff on winamp.

06-02-2021T18:56:23,ChromaticBard,Nice. Tom's streams are always awesome
06-02-2021T18:56:29,ThingsAreMoving,"But really, I'm hoping I'll see the advent of neural ports and true virtual reality."
06-02-2021T18:56:34,ThingsAreMoving,Imagine the possibilities
06-02-2021T18:56:45,Ordithus,people would never leave
06-02-2021T18:56:58,ThingsAreMoving,I would. Money is still a factor.
06-02-2021T18:57:18,Ordithus,and needing to eat XD
06-02-2021T18:57:30,BaskervilleNQH,Neural ports might be closer than you think XD

06-02-2021T18:58:02,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,I wonder if Tom watches Mark strim?
06-02-2021T18:58:18,TeapotOfDoom,honestly if i can explore the real world too not only the digital one that'd be neat
06-02-2021T18:58:33,TeapotOfDoom,although yeah i would probably still spend a lotta time in there
06-02-2021T18:58:42,BaskervilleNQH,Doesn't google maps have VR support?
06-02-2021T18:58:47,ChromaticBard,Augmented reality is a thing too.
06-02-2021T18:58:58,BaskervilleNQH,AR. Yeah.
06-02-2021T18:59:18,BaskervilleNQH,Hoo boy. Transhumanism is coming both fast and slower than we're expecting it to XD
06-02-2021T18:59:35,ThingsAreMoving,It's like fusion energy. It's always 20 years away

06-02-2021T19:00:00,TeapotOfDoom,well at least at the moment we know fusion is a bit further than 20 years out

06-02-2021T19:01:50,DarthKeidran,Lets face it. Elon Musk is our real life Tony Stark. We just need him to create a real Arc Reactor. Then we could run all vehicles on endless electricity.
06-02-2021T19:02:36,BaskervilleNQH,Elon Musk is a shit poster with the money to fuel his mad twitter ideas.

06-02-2021T22:42:04,SpazztasticKiwi,everybody should have access to pie

06-02-2021T22:42:09,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s a happy food
06-02-2021T22:42:34,Roughlandin,Pie is so versatile. It can be sweet or savory. You can have it for any meal!
06-02-2021T22:42:39,SpazztasticKiwi,nah the orchestra is trying to warm up and yet the cats wondering around asking for pets
06-02-2021T22:42:45,Roughlandin,Bawwww
06-02-2021T22:42:51,SpazztasticKiwi,of course no one can resist giving pets
06-02-2021T22:42:59,Roughlandin,How could you?
06-02-2021T22:43:28,Roughlandin,Oh no. I was thinking of a video of a cat that got onto a fashion show runway and everybody claps for it

06-02-2021T22:52:46,Ordithus,"Clovis's trembling, the slowing tail wag... and the way Clovis is standing in the last panels"
06-02-2021T22:53:01,Roughlandin,Clovis shivering is SUCH a great touch
06-02-2021T22:53:50,Roughlandin,But he can feel bad for all I care! He shouldn't have did that anyway!
06-02-2021T22:54:00,Roughlandin,:ptv-angry:
06-02-2021T22:54:27,BlackjackSec99,*sniffles*
06-02-2021T22:55:27,Roughlandin,But this is gonna do interesting things to Clovis' character either way
06-02-2021T22:55:50,Roughlandin,A) He's gonna be super mad now that the Team made him lose his boy
06-02-2021T22:56:17,Roughlandin,B) He's gonna be even more devastated when it all comes crumbling down and doing that to Brutus was for nothing
06-02-2021T22:56:21,Roughlandin,B
06-02-2021T22:56:30,Roughlandin,Dumb auto emoji lol

06-02-2021T23:04:08,CrRAR,I guess
06-02-2021T23:04:32,SpazztasticKiwi,you’re succeeding in variety
06-02-2021T23:04:47,Roughlandin,"I like those Cuties. Smol enough to snack on, easy to rip open with my bear hands"
06-02-2021T23:04:58,CrRAR,yes they're good

06-02-2021T23:05:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I want sweet
06-02-2021T23:05:53,CrRAR,orange ones inside
06-02-2021T23:05:55,Roughlandin,Yeah it's so hard to find ripe ones this time of year
06-02-2021T23:05:57,Ordithus,cara cara is yum
06-02-2021T23:06:06,CrRAR,not the yellows ones
06-02-2021T23:06:10,Roughlandin,Last time I got a winter mango it was hard as a rock
06-02-2021T23:06:30,CrRAR,"yeah, these are more pink looking inside, like grapefruit, and less citrus bitterness"
06-02-2021T23:06:43,CrRAR,than reg orange
06-02-2021T23:06:58,Roughlandin,Ooh pink orange
06-02-2021T23:07:24,CrRAR,"simply orange makes a blended juice with mango, it the only ok I'll buy now"
06-02-2021T23:07:33,CrRAR,*OJ
06-02-2021T23:08:12,CrRAR,mango lassis (indian yogert drink) also are the best
06-02-2021T23:08:16,Roughlandin,I had some of that! Used it as a mixer at a party once lol
06-02-2021T23:08:25,CrRAR,it damn good
06-02-2021T23:08:31,Roughlandin,"The simply orange mango stuff, I mean"
06-02-2021T23:08:39,CrRAR,yeahp
06-02-2021T23:09:13,CrRAR,cuz mango juice is more of a nectar than a juice it's amazing
06-02-2021T23:09:23,Roughlandin,Soooo sweet
06-02-2021T23:09:45,CrRAR,"i've had island mangoes before off the bush, and nothing compares"
06-02-2021T23:10:08,Roughlandin,Everything is better on an island
06-02-2021T23:10:21,CrRAR,the best ones are a smaller cultivar that DON'T grow on a tree
06-02-2021T23:10:36,CrRAR,lower growing shrub looking thing
06-02-2021T23:10:54,Roughlandin,Less energy goes to height. More to taste
06-02-2021T23:10:59,Roughlandin,Same concept with Flora
06-02-2021T23:11:02,Roughlandin,:p
06-02-2021T23:11:14,CrRAR,the simply juice I just noticed tastes more like those mangos than the yellow ones
06-02-2021T23:11:29,CrRAR,so they must have a good source
06-02-2021T23:11:36,CrRAR,lol
06-02-2021T23:12:17,TheSexyBeast,I could get fresh fruit year round from roadside stands when I lived near Tampa (hi again)
06-02-2021T23:12:26,Ordithus,o/
06-02-2021T23:12:40,Roughlandin,Wb!
06-02-2021T23:13:17,Roughlandin,All we have wild around here are blackberries. And most of the year those are just sticker bushes lol
06-02-2021T23:13:19,CrRAR,elloello
06-02-2021T23:13:48,CrRAR,yeah I been buying tons of BlackBerries
06-02-2021T23:13:59,TheSexyBeast,Florida mangoes >>> mangoes in the middle of the country
06-02-2021T23:14:08,Roughlandin,"Also apparently there are Paw Paws around here somewhere, but I've never seen a tree"
06-02-2021T23:14:57,TheSexyBeast,Raspberries are delicious too
06-02-2021T23:15:06,CrRAR,"I just know that some of the larger softball sized ish mangos even marked from Puerto Rico, aren't exactly the good GOOD ones"
06-02-2021T23:15:32,CrRAR,the good ones are slightly smaller
06-02-2021T23:15:56,Roughlandin,"If they're in the store, they usually get picked and shipped waaay before they're fully ripe"
06-02-2021T23:19:01,SpazztasticKiwi,🥭
06-02-2021T23:19:31,TheSexyBeast,Tried to explain how great it was to buy fresh fruit when you wanted/needed it instead of buying a bag of unripe ones and waiting for them to ripen. They still don't get it.
06-02-2021T23:19:59,Roughlandin,All this fruit talk is making me hungry but I think all we have in the house are apples and some grapes
06-02-2021T23:20:06,Roughlandin,...Also maybe an avocado
06-02-2021T23:20:43,TheSexyBeast,Make guac
06-02-2021T23:21:15,Ordithus,hmm I have no idea what we have wild around here
06-02-2021T23:21:21,Ordithus,other than mosquitos and bear
06-02-2021T23:23:19,CrRAR,"but yeah, the big ones are the tree ones, basically"
06-02-2021T23:24:45,TheSexyBeast,"So I am headed to bed, where I will dream about fresh fruit in Tampa where the weather is warm."
06-02-2021T23:24:59,KeefMcDerpface,night Beast
