21-02-2021T00:01:29,ThingsAreMoving,Good
21-02-2021T00:01:32,steelabjur,There are somethings worse than death. Ask Willow.
21-02-2021T00:01:44,Twokinds,There once was born a very beautiful dragon. One of the very first.
21-02-2021T00:01:47,vevans0009,:thumbsup:
21-02-2021T00:01:48,Roughlandin,Oooh

21-02-2021T00:02:19,Twokinds,"At and early age she had a fear of death. When her mother assured her she was biologically immortal, and would almost certainly live for centuries, she only became more terrified"
21-02-2021T00:02:30,Twokinds,"as it meant unlike other creatures with finite lives, when she died, she would have missed out on infinite potential."
21-02-2021T00:03:11,Dadrobit,"Huh, an immortal dragon with a midlife crisis."
21-02-2021T00:03:34,Zakuru,:ptv-sad:
21-02-2021T00:03:44,vevans0009,At a young age
21-02-2021T00:03:56,Roughlandin,The things we do in fear
21-02-2021T00:04:04,Twokinds,So she looked for ways to keep herself safe. She hid herself away and eventually found safety and power when she started feeding on black magic.
21-02-2021T00:04:09,unsteddyphoenix,Eternity could drive anyone crazy
21-02-2021T00:04:20,KeefMcDerpface,0.0 Oh...
21-02-2021T00:04:21,steelabjur,Ooh. I like necromancy with unusual reasoning!
21-02-2021T00:04:26,ThingsAreMoving,"Oooooh, black mana strikes again"
21-02-2021T00:04:28,KeefMcDerpface,The route as Trace...
21-02-2021T00:04:32,Twokinds,"Instead of going out herself, she used her shapeshifting to split parts of herself off, while her main body remained safe."
21-02-2021T00:04:37,KeefMcDerpface,Sort of.
21-02-2021T00:04:44,Zakuru,Like voldemort?

21-02-2021T00:05:29,Twokinds,"Over time she resembled less and less of a dragon, and began losing her sanity as she tore herself into more and more pieces every time she grew, eventually becoming the source of the fey in the forest."
21-02-2021T00:05:33,KeefMcDerpface,bye deathclaw
21-02-2021T00:05:34,Twokinds,The end! :D

21-02-2021T00:05:48,ThingsAreMoving,Good story
21-02-2021T00:05:49,Roughlandin,I thought she had a dragon-y look
21-02-2021T00:05:49,CrRAR,wow
21-02-2021T00:05:51,BlackjackSec99,ooooooooooo awesome lore
21-02-2021T00:05:51,Zakuru,lovely story tom! :ptv-excited:
21-02-2021T00:05:53,Ordithus,thanks for the story!
21-02-2021T00:05:53,ChromaticBard,Cya DC!
21-02-2021T00:06:00,Ordithus,tragic character
21-02-2021T00:06:06,Tanque09,wow awesome
21-02-2021T00:06:17,ThingsAreMoving,\o Deathclaw
21-02-2021T00:06:21,KeefMcDerpface,< And now she's this.
21-02-2021T00:06:24,Roughlandin,Too much black magic leads to unstable forms. Probably not good when you're a dragon and you ARE magic
21-02-2021T00:06:28,unsteddyphoenix,See if dragons had a mask to take care of them these kinda things wouldnt happen
21-02-2021T00:06:37,unsteddyphoenix,Too bad the dragon mask is busy being a squirrel
21-02-2021T00:06:39,Katfeathers,Quite tragic
21-02-2021T00:06:44,ThingsAreMoving,She's still beautiful. Only a little bit putrid and broken
21-02-2021T00:06:49,RandomTonio,Maybe that backstory would be shared once the sketch is posted?
21-02-2021T00:06:54,Roughlandin,Question... If Willow's mom dies... Does WIllow cease to exist?
21-02-2021T00:07:06,vevans0009,Seems so
21-02-2021T00:07:07,Zakuru,i'd assume so
21-02-2021T00:07:14,InTheLionsDen,For a moment I thought that it was going to be that her body eventually died but the remote pieces remained because of the black magic.
21-02-2021T00:07:24,Twokinds,No willow is independant from her mother
21-02-2021T00:07:28,ThingsAreMoving,"Wait, that literally means Willow is partially dragon magic"
21-02-2021T00:07:32,vevans0009,Well then.
21-02-2021T00:07:34,vevans0009,xD
21-02-2021T00:07:37,ChromaticBard,huh
21-02-2021T00:07:47,steelabjur,"I'd think not, Willow has become it's own entity."
21-02-2021T00:07:48,Twokinds,Dragons are being of magic.
21-02-2021T00:07:50,unsteddyphoenix,Willow is a dragon confirmed
21-02-2021T00:07:53,BlackjackSec99,awesome
21-02-2021T00:08:04,Twokinds,"But willow's mother has fed on black magic for so long, she's literally made of black magic now."
21-02-2021T00:08:12,vevans0009,Yeesh
21-02-2021T00:08:14,Roughlandin,You are what you eat
21-02-2021T00:08:15,ThingsAreMoving,Antidragon
21-02-2021T00:08:24,BlackjackSec99,thats kinda scary
21-02-2021T00:08:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve been everywhere but nowhere at once today
21-02-2021T00:08:40,CrRAR,like scattering of spores kinda back into the world
21-02-2021T00:08:46,unsteddyphoenix,Doesnt black magic decay you?
21-02-2021T00:08:53,Twokinds,"She sends out her little versions of herself, the fey creatures, to go find new sources of black magic crystals."
21-02-2021T00:08:57,Roughlandin,"Laura: ""Willow... This might be hard to hear... but I think your mom might be evil."""
21-02-2021T00:08:57,vevans0009,"Willow CAN""T join her ""mother"""
21-02-2021T00:08:57,unsteddyphoenix,Ironic if that kills her in the end
21-02-2021T00:09:04,Twokinds,"It does, but it doens't kill a dragon like it does mortals."
21-02-2021T00:09:11,steelabjur,"I'm reminded of Trace's look in the ""What if"" sketch where Trace saved her..."
21-02-2021T00:09:13,unsteddyphoenix,"Ah I see, dragon ex machina"
21-02-2021T00:09:36,Zakuru,@steel trruuueee
21-02-2021T00:09:39,Roughlandin,She dug too greedily and too deep
21-02-2021T00:09:42,Zakuru,similar eyes..
21-02-2021T00:09:49,SpazztasticKiwi,wat
21-02-2021T00:09:56,Katfeathers,Dunklezain?
21-02-2021T00:10:06,steelabjur,"Erm, saved Laura that is."
21-02-2021T00:10:06,Twokinds,The parts of her that go out sometimes end up getting lost and then become indepenant.
21-02-2021T00:10:18,Roughlandin,Ooh. An army of Willows
21-02-2021T00:10:19,ThingsAreMoving,"Is black magic inherently evil,, or is it just.... different?"
21-02-2021T00:10:32,Twokinds,"That's what happened to willow, and that's what would happen to willow's body if she left it somewhere for long enoguh."
21-02-2021T00:10:35,BlackjackSec99,this begs the question... would Nora have let Trace save Laura? would she be able to save Trace after the effects take hold?
21-02-2021T00:10:45,Twokinds,Black magic is just souls.
21-02-2021T00:10:48,Roughlandin,...Now I can't stop imagining an army of derpy wisps bumping into trees repeatedly like magic roombas
21-02-2021T00:10:51,Twokinds,It's the life force of other things.
21-02-2021T00:11:05,steelabjur,black magic seems to be life force turned into magic. So not good.
21-02-2021T00:11:13,Twokinds,Willows go out and tempt travelers to their death to capture their souls and bring them back.
21-02-2021T00:11:28,Ordithus,:eyes: great success! \o/
21-02-2021T00:11:34,CrRAR,aww
21-02-2021T00:11:47,Roughlandin,Oooh. Plot arc idea! Willow vs. Anti-Willow(s)
21-02-2021T00:11:51,Twokinds,"Anyway, I'm gunna finish this one later. see if I can draw it better."
21-02-2021T00:12:00,CrRAR,alrighty
21-02-2021T00:12:00,BlackjackSec99,^.^
21-02-2021T00:12:02,Roughlandin,Looks good to me! Good luck Tom!
21-02-2021T00:12:04,ChromaticBard,Ok! It is already looking amazing!
21-02-2021T00:12:08,vevans0009,Alrighty Lore Tom. 8D
21-02-2021T00:12:08,KeefMcDerpface,ok tom
21-02-2021T00:12:12,Ordithus,Very interested to see what you come up with
21-02-2021T00:12:21,BlackjackSec99,Thanks for the lore and the stream Tom! Awesome work!
21-02-2021T00:12:30,ThingsAreMoving,"Interesting. But somehow it acts like a parasite. Other forms of mana are just energy, it seems, whereas once you start using black mana, you just need more, and more and eventually it consumes you"
21-02-2021T00:12:35,Roughlandin,I still think her horns need a creepy orb of wisp light between them
21-02-2021T00:12:36,Dadrobit,"o dang, the deep lore tonight"
21-02-2021T00:12:54,Twokinds,"I do have old versions of willow's mom, but I never liked how it looked. Could never get her to look right"
21-02-2021T00:12:59,Roughlandin,But I know what ever you draw will be super cool!
21-02-2021T00:13:02,ChromaticBard,dang
21-02-2021T00:13:04,vevans0009,Oh?
21-02-2021T00:13:13,Zakuru,wow man!
21-02-2021T00:13:18,ThingsAreMoving,"That's some deep lore, there Tom. I would love to see some form of it compiled into a book. Ever thought of publishing something like that?"
21-02-2021T00:13:19,Twokinds,one sec I'll find them
21-02-2021T00:13:26,Zakuru,:eyes:
21-02-2021T00:13:27,ChromaticBard,This has been an awesome stream today!
21-02-2021T00:13:29,Roughlandin,I think I get the idea. So she's like... becoming part of the forest?
21-02-2021T00:13:29,vevans0009,Been quite a fun stream guys.  Bye then
21-02-2021T00:13:39,Roughlandin,Night vevans

21-02-2021T00:15:33,steelabjur,"Like I said earlier, Willow's Mom reminds me of the Corpse Tearer Linnorm: http://www.mojobob.com/roleplay/monstrousmanual/d/draglcot.html"
21-02-2021T00:15:34,Ordithus,"new waifu, teddy?"
21-02-2021T00:15:39,SpazztasticKiwi,when I decide to try a new diet
21-02-2021T00:15:57,ThingsAreMoving,"Kiwibro, don't mingle with crazy. It never ends well"
21-02-2021T00:15:58,Twokinds,"In the story, she never confronts the characters in person until the very end. Until then, she just sends proxy versions of herself, like the anthro version there."
21-02-2021T00:16:13,Roughlandin,Reminds me of the creepy version of Rose you did on Halloween
21-02-2021T00:16:14,Zakuru,oooo :eyes:
21-02-2021T00:16:15,ChromaticBard,Interesting
21-02-2021T00:16:22,Dadrobit,Don't wanna spoil the surprise.
21-02-2021T00:16:33,SpazztasticKiwi,looks very belongs in a sanitarium
21-02-2021T00:16:52,Roughlandin,*Puts her in a glass terrarium.*
21-02-2021T00:16:56,ThingsAreMoving,How do you even contain such a creature
21-02-2021T00:16:56,SpazztasticKiwi,so is this a side comic
21-02-2021T00:17:03,Twokinds,It was a long time ago
21-02-2021T00:17:10,SpazztasticKiwi,oh old ideas
21-02-2021T00:17:15,unsteddyphoenix,That sounds like a long comic then
21-02-2021T00:17:17,Twokinds,"Unfortunately, even though it gets suggested a lot, I just don't have time to work on it right now XD"
21-02-2021T00:17:21,unsteddyphoenix,Was planned to be at least
21-02-2021T00:17:21,SpazztasticKiwi,cool
21-02-2021T00:17:29,Zakuru,its fine tom! It looks amazing so far!
21-02-2021T00:17:34,ChromaticBard,"Scrapped stuff, or just set off to the side for a later day?"
21-02-2021T00:17:35,Roughlandin,Was this before the Riftwall East got involved or was that always planned as part of the project?
21-02-2021T00:17:37,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,I am back now
21-02-2021T00:17:39,BlackjackSec99,Ide LOVE to see it some day ^.^

21-02-2021T00:17:55,SpazztasticKiwi,of the tarot
21-02-2021T00:18:03,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
21-02-2021T00:18:09,Roughlandin,Does she have black mana crystals in her horns?
21-02-2021T00:18:16,ThingsAreMoving,She does look more 'beautiful' here
21-02-2021T00:18:21,Katfeathers,"Last I heard, none of the side comics got out of planing"
21-02-2021T00:18:29,ChromaticBard,I like the look here

21-02-2021T00:19:32,steelabjur,"Well, Willow's Mom is almost pure magic, so to stop her just remove the magic in the area? Sort of what got Nora in the comic?"
21-02-2021T00:20:19,ThingsAreMoving,Good luck building a tower without her killg you off first
21-02-2021T00:20:52,Ordithus,"just send Trace to absorb her, he'll be fine"

21-02-2021T00:21:14,Roughlandin,Hmm... Do the souls she eat just... disappear? Or are they still inside her somewhere?
21-02-2021T00:21:22,ThingsAreMoving,"Although... If you 'fed' her enough normal mana, would the process reverse itself to some degree?"
21-02-2021T00:21:26,BlackjackSec99,"dissolved, im guessing?"
21-02-2021T00:21:35,Roughlandin,Like does she literally devour your soul. Cause that is... terrifying
21-02-2021T00:21:38,SpazztasticKiwi,bouncing around inside her like a morbid game of pinball
21-02-2021T00:21:44,Dadrobit,She has eyes on the inside
21-02-2021T00:21:58,ThingsAreMoving,"Or is she doomed, and can only intake black mana now?"
21-02-2021T00:21:59,Twokinds,She's probably too far gone. She'd likely die if cut off from her black magic now.
21-02-2021T00:22:10,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,I love this dergons backstory
21-02-2021T00:22:14,ThingsAreMoving,That is sad
21-02-2021T00:22:20,SpazztasticKiwi,so this is a dark dragon
21-02-2021T00:22:30,Roughlandin,She's not even a dragon anymore
21-02-2021T00:22:34,steelabjur,I'd assume she converts the souls she eats into black magic to sustain her.
21-02-2021T00:22:36,Roughlandin,Too much of her is gone
21-02-2021T00:22:52,Dadrobit,"By chance, is this one of Nora's first born? Why Nora was so against Trace even trying to use Black Magic?"
21-02-2021T00:22:58,RandomTonio,The story backstory of Willow's mom should put on the sketch once it is released
21-02-2021T00:24:02,Roughlandin,"*Enters forest. Hears something singing ""Come Little Children. Sees this.*"

21-02-2021T00:24:24,Katfeathers,"Going by the back story, I'd hazard a guess at maybe a sis or aunt of Nora's"

21-02-2021T00:24:34,Roughlandin,Night Palm
21-02-2021T00:25:16,ThingsAreMoving,"So, I've asked this a while before, but you probably were too busy typing. Do you think about compiling the lore and publishing it in a form of a book, Tom?"
21-02-2021T00:25:51,Roughlandin,Kinda what he's doing with his new project
21-02-2021T00:26:00,Twokinds,That'd be quite the effort in itself
21-02-2021T00:26:19,SpazztasticKiwi,is
21-02-2021T00:26:27,SpazztasticKiwi,is she melting into the ground
21-02-2021T00:26:36,CrRAR,yerp
21-02-2021T00:26:37,Roughlandin,I think she IS the ground
21-02-2021T00:26:43,ChromaticBard,^
21-02-2021T00:26:46,SpazztasticKiwi,talk about the floor is lava
21-02-2021T00:26:49,ChromaticBard,I think so too
21-02-2021T00:26:50,InTheLionsDen,This whole area is her.
21-02-2021T00:26:51,Ordithus,spoopy
21-02-2021T00:26:51,Katfeathers,Sounds right
21-02-2021T00:27:06,AspiringNoodle,I imagine her body is mainly like a swamp composed of the souls of the dead she damned with her wisps
21-02-2021T00:27:16,AspiringNoodle,And that she can create this more corporeal dragon form at will
21-02-2021T00:27:18,ThingsAreMoving,"New project? :eyes: I'm not in the loop, Rough. Mind giving me some deets over DM?"
21-02-2021T00:27:22,Roughlandin,"""Come into my parlor"", said the not-dragon to the fox"
21-02-2021T00:27:57,Roughlandin,Tom showed it at the end of stream a week ago Friday
21-02-2021T00:28:03,Roughlandin,For anyone interested
21-02-2021T00:28:08,SpazztasticKiwi,only project I knew of were the possible side comics & help with sketches should Tom find people
21-02-2021T00:28:20,ThingsAreMoving,Cool. I'll check the vod.
21-02-2021T00:28:24,ThingsAreMoving,Thanks for the info
21-02-2021T00:28:42,Roughlandin,No prob. He basically made it public but it was at the very end of stream
21-02-2021T00:28:52,Roughlandin,So I'm guessing I'm okay to mention it.
21-02-2021T00:29:00,Roughlandin,(INB4 Tom bans me...)
21-02-2021T00:29:27,steelabjur,Pool of Black Magic in the center of a decaying swamp that can take a dragon-like form at will is Lovecraftian.
21-02-2021T00:29:28,ThingsAreMoving,"A bit paranoid, mr. bear"
21-02-2021T00:29:33,Roughlandin,Ooh she... drippy.:ptv-grossedout:

21-02-2021T00:29:55,SpazztasticKiwi,this is the dragon of the forest swamp
21-02-2021T00:29:58,ThingsAreMoving,That's not good for your mental health.
21-02-2021T00:30:07,Roughlandin,Keeps me on guard haha
21-02-2021T00:30:14,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,is she Nora's Aunt?

21-02-2021T00:35:18,ShamusTheFox,Just because something looks dark and scary doesn't make it so.

21-02-2021T00:35:57,ThingsAreMoving,Aw
21-02-2021T00:35:58,ShamusTheFox,I see!

21-02-2021T00:36:47,ThingsAreMoving,"That's what willows use to lead travellers to their demise, yes?"
21-02-2021T00:36:48,Twokinds,Yeah she has a lot of control over her forest.
21-02-2021T00:36:49,SpazztasticKiwi,“I didn’t kill him the poison did”
21-02-2021T00:36:50,steelabjur,"Sort of like most people don't kill the meat they eat, they have others do it for them."

21-02-2021T00:37:07,Roughlandin,Causality manipulation. Space distortion. Basic ancient evil stuff
21-02-2021T00:37:13,SpazztasticKiwi,“that’s  irrelevant”

21-02-2021T00:37:41,ShamusTheFox,That's actually really interesting.
21-02-2021T00:37:41,Roughlandin,Her body is just a simulacrum. Like a golom
21-02-2021T00:37:42,Twokinds,"Well, yeah. She did."
21-02-2021T00:37:43,unsteddyphoenix,Is it fate manipulation or terrain manipulation

21-02-2021T00:38:24,ShamusTheFox,Ooof.
21-02-2021T00:38:27,unsteddyphoenix,Or did she will her friend to die

21-02-2021T00:38:48,Roughlandin,"Did her friend's soul ""get away"" or do you just have to be IN the forest for your soul to get devoured?"

21-02-2021T00:38:56,Twokinds,"It just happens, Willow doesn't mean for any of the bad stuff that happens around her."
21-02-2021T00:39:01,Twokinds,It's just automatic.

21-02-2021T00:40:10,Roughlandin,"So since Willow never actually brought her friend's soul to her mother, did it get away or was she devoured?"
21-02-2021T00:40:14,Twokinds,"Well it's more like, she unconciously takes one step to the left or right, which causes the person behind her to follow in just a way that she slides down into a pit."

21-02-2021T00:42:06,ShamusTheFox,Awww
21-02-2021T00:42:10,Katfeathers,Kinda sorta cursed herself
21-02-2021T00:42:17,Roughlandin,Tom explained earlier Muon. She was a dragon but was afraid of dying so she ate black mana to sustain herself
21-02-2021T00:42:29,steelabjur,@MuonNeutrino  Dragon who turned to Black Magic to extend her already nearly immortal life.
21-02-2021T00:42:38,KeefMcDerpface,And then became that.
21-02-2021T00:42:42,Roughlandin,And the black mana replaced the regular mana that dragons are normally made of
21-02-2021T00:42:49,Roughlandin,So now she's like an... anti-dragon
21-02-2021T00:42:50,SpazztasticKiwi,does she have a name

21-02-2021T01:02:05,SpazztasticKiwi,you shouldn’t have said anything
21-02-2021T01:02:41,KeefMcDerpface,"Mark is starting to be like Modern AU Laura in a way, but with less deaths."
21-02-2021T01:03:02,Roughlandin,He just doesn't like to tell his fans about his Re-life policy
21-02-2021T01:03:12,KeefMcDerpface,hehe
21-02-2021T01:03:28,InTheLionsDen,He goes outside too much. Very hazardous.
21-02-2021T01:03:37,Roughlandin,THAT'S the problem
21-02-2021T01:03:59,Roughlandin,Can confirm the last time I was injured was outside
21-02-2021T01:04:01,SpazztasticKiwi,he gives me legit anxiety sometimes
21-02-2021T01:04:02,Roughlandin,Outside bad
21-02-2021T01:04:24,SpazztasticKiwi,it should be statistically impossible for one man to be so accident prone yet here we are
21-02-2021T01:04:35,Apostrophe,Sounds a bit like me
21-02-2021T01:04:52,Roughlandin,He just likes to test his body's limits
21-02-2021T01:05:01,Apostrophe,"Falling off multiple mountains, in my case. Gravity usually wins"
21-02-2021T01:05:12,Apostrophe,It's like having a head on collision with an entire planet
21-02-2021T01:05:13,SpazztasticKiwi,bad part is he wasn’t trying at the time
21-02-2021T01:05:18,SpazztasticKiwi,he was walking Chica
21-02-2021T01:05:40,Roughlandin,"Dancing at a wedding for me. Tried to bust a move, wound up busting myself"
21-02-2021T01:05:53,Apostrophe,I sprained an ankle dancing at a bar once
21-02-2021T01:05:57,Apostrophe,"Well, dancing is a strong word"
21-02-2021T01:06:24,Roughlandin,I was grooving dude. Right up till my knee went 'pop'
21-02-2021T01:07:02,SpazztasticKiwi,oof
21-02-2021T01:07:20,Roughlandin,Then I spent the next half hour holding semi-cold beers to my knee (they were out of ice) and drove myself home
21-02-2021T01:07:33,Roughlandin,Actually managed to get upstairs into bed.
21-02-2021T01:07:46,Roughlandin,Woke up the next morning and couldn't move my leg
21-02-2021T01:07:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"I sound like every concerned mother ever but Mark, no more hospitals"
21-02-2021T01:07:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"if it’s not a check up, stay out of them"
21-02-2021T01:08:16,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s gonna give somebody a heart attack
21-02-2021T01:08:22,Roughlandin,He needs to just put the leash in Chica's mouth and let her walk herself
21-02-2021T01:08:31,KeefMcDerpface,lol
21-02-2021T01:08:40,Roughlandin,He's gonna give poor Amy a heart attack
21-02-2021T01:08:52,SpazztasticKiwi,or their mother
21-02-2021T01:08:53,AspiringNoodle,Markiplier: *snaps his fungers*

21-02-2021T01:09:29,Roughlandin,Bleck. He was describing how he broke his arm when he was 12 and I was cringing so hard
21-02-2021T01:09:36,Roughlandin,I hate stories like that
21-02-2021T01:10:00,KeefMcDerpface,"That bad, huh?"
21-02-2021T01:10:13,Roughlandin,Gives my sympathetic pain and makes my skin crawl
21-02-2021T01:10:36,Roughlandin,He said it was like he arm made a stair step

21-02-2021T01:11:54,KeefMcDerpface,night rough
21-02-2021T01:11:54,Roughlandin,:bear::zzz:
21-02-2021T01:13:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean I broke my arm at 12 too
21-02-2021T01:14:10,SpazztasticKiwi,it made a light pop sound if I remember right and I didn’t feel anything unless I tried to bend it
21-02-2021T01:14:26,SpazztasticKiwi,but I didn’t snap the bone like he describes
21-02-2021T01:15:54,SpazztasticKiwi,also broke mine at the elbow and not the ulna or humerus
21-02-2021T01:16:31,InTheLionsDen,"Probably depends on the break and if it breaks the skin or damages other tissue but I have heard that sprains often hurt more than a break. Only have had sprains, not breaks (fortunately) so can't confirm."
21-02-2021T01:18:27,Apostrophe,"Sprains can be harder to heal from, as well"
21-02-2021T01:18:34,Apostrophe,Ligament heals a lot less neatly than bone
21-02-2021T01:18:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve sprained my ankles plenty
21-02-2021T01:19:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"the most notable was when my left twisted, slid on carpet, and I landed on it with running momentum"
21-02-2021T01:20:19,SpazztasticKiwi,chipped a bone & sprained the ankle bad enough they had me in a restraining brace
21-02-2021T01:20:36,SpazztasticKiwi,when I tell you that shit Hurt....
21-02-2021T01:21:33,SpazztasticKiwi,so sprains probably do hurt worse - that one sure did more than my arm when it broke
21-02-2021T01:22:00,SpazztasticKiwi,double jointed ankles are not enjoyable
21-02-2021T01:23:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I call Tom old and hear I am nearing the ripe age of 25
21-02-2021T01:23:21,SpazztasticKiwi,here

21-02-2021T01:33:02,AspiringNoodle,"Well, as long as everyone's safe"
21-02-2021T01:33:06,AspiringNoodle,That's all that matters

21-02-2021T02:50:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I say it’s reasonable to believe he wouldn’t risk hurting himself further or permanently but that’s what I thought when he had his wisdom teeth removed & lo and behold he ended up getting an infection
21-02-2021T03:13:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m sure he’s fine
21-02-2021T03:13:44,SpazztasticKiwi,he could be immortal at this point
