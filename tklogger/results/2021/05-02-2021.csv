05-02-2021T02:11:42,ChromaticBard,What rule says they can't use reach weapons?
05-02-2021T02:11:45,unsteddyphoenix,Did he pat your head?
05-02-2021T02:11:45,Roughlandin,Fun is the most important part!

05-02-2021T02:13:17,Ordithus,"and the heavy stat on the weapon, and it gives disadvantage"
05-02-2021T02:13:24,unsteddyphoenix,yeye ofc
05-02-2021T02:13:36,Ordithus,a halberd is heavy
05-02-2021T02:13:42,SageSaga,yeah if a creature is Small or smaller they have disadvantage using a heavy weapon
05-02-2021T02:13:47,ChromaticBard,Yeah
05-02-2021T02:13:51,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,I believe that Teddy counts as small
05-02-2021T02:13:59,swack24,oh no! No hurt Nibbly!
05-02-2021T02:14:08,ChromaticBard,"So if you are a small creature and want to have a reach weapon, just use a whip lol"

05-02-2021T02:14:57,Ordithus,but does have disadvantage used on foot on someone within 5 feet
05-02-2021T02:15:03,ChromaticBard,yeah
05-02-2021T02:15:09,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,is that permission for me to whip Teddy? :ctwokinds-floraquestion:

05-02-2021T02:44:03,CrRAR,uh oh
05-02-2021T02:44:07,Dadrobit,"A lot of the folks in my community REALLLY value their secrecy. Several of them have a system where their guests have to know a fake name to see them, and if someone gives their real name, they're to be immediately turned away."
05-02-2021T02:44:19,CrRAR,huh
05-02-2021T02:44:19,SpazztasticKiwi,impales on a post & the weight of his loot pulled him down on it further
05-02-2021T02:44:34,Ordithus,well that's horrifying
05-02-2021T02:44:39,TheSexyBeast,F***
05-02-2021T02:44:39,CrRAR,unfortunate end
05-02-2021T02:44:56,CrRAR,so scary ;~;
05-02-2021T02:45:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t believe it was explicitly said but I doubt he made it
05-02-2021T02:45:18,AspiringNoodle,"Oof, that makes me think of that one story from the Spanish first invading / sacking Central America..."
05-02-2021T02:45:41,Dadrobit,"So cameras around the area are a double edged sword for them. They love the security, they hate cameras and the potential of being seen by people who they don't want seeing them."
05-02-2021T02:45:51,AspiringNoodle,"Soldiers who had robbed the natives might have tried retreated / fleeing across the river, but the weight of their armor / loot could make them sink and drown..."
05-02-2021T02:47:03,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s some unfortunate accidents
05-02-2021T02:47:19,SpazztasticKiwi,simple little thing could end up killing you
05-02-2021T02:48:18,SpazztasticKiwi,but follow the Sage advice: use the gate as intended when navigating a fenced area
05-02-2021T02:48:36,TheSexyBeast,The history books always make the Spanish out as conquerors who succeeded in spite of themselves
05-02-2021T02:49:08,SpazztasticKiwi,history is written by the victors
05-02-2021T02:50:11,TheSexyBeast,I prefer truth to narrative
05-02-2021T02:50:43,Roughlandin,"Fences mean things, people!"
05-02-2021T02:51:11,Roughlandin,"Mostly ""Stay outta there!"""
05-02-2021T02:51:23,AspiringNoodle,"Fences are merely ""suggestions"""
05-02-2021T02:51:28,AspiringNoodle,Much like speed limits
05-02-2021T02:51:33,AspiringNoodle,And road lines
05-02-2021T02:51:40,AspiringNoodle,And cart return areas :D
05-02-2021T02:51:42,unsteddyphoenix,And all laws
05-02-2021T02:51:44,Dadrobit,"Man, your stream always throws me for a loop with the FFT ost."
05-02-2021T02:51:58,unsteddyphoenix,Except for stream rules. Those are real
05-02-2021T02:52:05,SpazztasticKiwi,and that cop you thought you saw behind that billboa- oh no now he’s after you
05-02-2021T02:52:11,unsteddyphoenix,"Anyway, im off~ Thanks for streamin sage"

05-02-2021T02:53:34,Dadrobit,"If my PS3 still worked, I'd still be playing it lol."
05-02-2021T02:53:49,Ordithus,my PS2 and my copy don't agree
05-02-2021T02:54:01,Ordithus,freezes after the tutorial battle

05-02-2021T02:56:00,Dadrobit,It makes me happy just remembering how incredible Tactics story was/is.
05-02-2021T02:56:23,Ordithus,that game taught me the value of multiple save files
05-02-2021T02:56:40,Ordithus,Wiegraf you jerk
05-02-2021T02:56:54,SageSaga,it taught me you can use red chickens to kill everything
05-02-2021T02:57:08,Ordithus,and final bosses are cake walks!
05-02-2021T02:57:15,FoxxTrotter,:chicken:

05-02-2021T02:57:55,SageSaga,and master swordsman is code for swordsman thats so amazing his attacks are magic
05-02-2021T02:58:22,Ordithus,yeah that guy is OP
05-02-2021T02:58:38,Dadrobit,I enjoyed grinding out Meteor to kill Algus with.
05-02-2021T02:58:53,SageSaga,"i did recently read a book about a ""master swordsman"" that was basically magic"
05-02-2021T02:59:06,SageSaga,he was reincarnated and wanted to master Magic this time
05-02-2021T03:00:47,Ordithus,is this the last we will see of Mike?

05-02-2021T03:23:44,SageSaga,its pretty late for most people so a lot of them have signed off for the night though- so i dont expect chat to be very active :P

05-02-2021T03:24:08,AspiringNoodle,...no wonder my sleep schedule is a mess

05-02-2021T07:21:08,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
05-02-2021T08:08:35,Dadrobit,He made comments about Vore and Tom banned him for laughing it off when his comment was removed. So light trolling basically.
05-02-2021T08:15:16,BadFoMo,"I've done exactly that in the past before; don't know why this one was different. Also, I wasn't laughing it off, I was laughing at the fact that it was bad enought to get removed. So, can I say sorry for any misunderstanding?"

05-02-2021T15:40:54,SpazztasticKiwi,you ever doubt that someone you know is the same size as you
05-02-2021T15:41:29,SageSaga,wut
05-02-2021T15:41:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark and I both wear a medium shirt
05-02-2021T15:41:51,SageSaga,so?
05-02-2021T15:41:53,SpazztasticKiwi,we are not the same size person
05-02-2021T15:41:55,SpazztasticKiwi,how
05-02-2021T15:42:03,Ordithus,men's medium and women's medium are not the same
05-02-2021T15:42:10,SageSaga,yeah thats one thing-
05-02-2021T15:42:33,SpazztasticKiwi,point but I’m wearing the unisex unus annus shirt
05-02-2021T15:42:36,SageSaga,also there's a difference in how they fit
05-02-2021T15:43:47,SageSaga,"does it fit like a ""glove"" or does it ""fit""? because i get the feeling Mark wears clothes that are pretty tight to him"
05-02-2021T15:44:30,SpazztasticKiwi,for him it seems to fit like a glove
05-02-2021T15:44:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"or second skin, depending who you ask"
05-02-2021T15:44:51,SpazztasticKiwi,on me it goes mid thigh
05-02-2021T15:45:06,SageSaga,see?
05-02-2021T15:45:56,SpazztasticKiwi,the only thing I see is he fills his out more
05-02-2021T15:46:07,SpazztasticKiwi,because at max he’s an inch or two taller
05-02-2021T15:46:11,SageSaga,"=_= that is what they call ""fitting"""
05-02-2021T15:46:54,SpazztasticKiwi,if there was a size between small and medium I’d get it
05-02-2021T15:46:59,Ordithus,saaaaame
05-02-2021T15:47:23,Ordithus,height and shoulders need medium but I am not filled out
05-02-2021T15:49:09,SpazztasticKiwi,they were describing Marks size & Amy said he’s built like a brick sht house
05-02-2021T15:49:27,SpazztasticKiwi,and mark follows that up with “and I move like a freight liner”
05-02-2021T15:51:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"aside from that, who else knows about this guy who was juggling being a police chief with 2 fiancés & 17 girlfriends"
05-02-2021T15:51:26,SageSaga,havent heard of it
05-02-2021T15:51:36,SpazztasticKiwi,& he was married
05-02-2021T15:51:51,SpazztasticKiwi,with 4 kids

05-02-2021T15:52:04,SageSaga,oh yeah now i know exactly who you are talking about
05-02-2021T15:52:05,SpazztasticKiwi,who the hells got that kinda time
05-02-2021T15:52:08,SageSaga,not really
05-02-2021T15:53:28,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s a scandal story more than anything as far as I know
05-02-2021T15:54:03,SageSaga,pretty sure its just an anime
05-02-2021T15:54:47,Ordithus,anime would stop at 8
05-02-2021T15:54:52,Ordithus,too unrealistic
05-02-2021T15:55:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to know his reasoning
05-02-2021T15:55:30,Ordithus,addiction
05-02-2021T15:56:59,SageSaga,maybe his heart is just so full of love he cant just give it all to one woman
05-02-2021T15:57:41,Ordithus,:csagesaga-nynastare: I'm sure that's the reason yup
05-02-2021T16:00:34,Ordithus,:eyes: is the material component of this spell a framing nail?
05-02-2021T16:01:03,SageSaga,it is called Nail to the Sky
05-02-2021T16:01:18,Ordithus,oh yeah haha
05-02-2021T16:01:19,SageSaga,also Spazz you left out the good part of the story!
05-02-2021T16:01:29,SageSaga,if this is the same story-
05-02-2021T16:01:30,Ordithus,quite literal
05-02-2021T16:02:06,SageSaga,if this is the same story they found out because he was in a car accident and all 17 girls came to visit him in the hospital XD
05-02-2021T16:03:22,SageSaga,that's some soap opera drama
05-02-2021T16:04:12,SpazztasticKiwi,that must’ve been a very eventful er
05-02-2021T16:04:49,SageSaga,how do you mention this story and not the best part? XD
05-02-2021T16:05:19,Ordithus,"so did he survive the er or did 1 wife, 2 fiances, and 17 girlfriends work together"
05-02-2021T16:06:21,SageSaga,well this was also like from 6 years ago
05-02-2021T16:06:36,SageSaga,so maybe by now he has 20 girlfriends and 6 wives
05-02-2021T16:12:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I said I didn’t know too much about it
05-02-2021T16:12:50,SpazztasticKiwi,& I was just on break
05-02-2021T16:17:52,Hogan,Afternoonings!

05-02-2021T16:34:14,SageSaga,in terms of what im doing- it makes magic look cooler- in the case of the story- its for nailing people to the sky
05-02-2021T16:34:21,BadFoMo,"Y... yeah. That's the, um... scietific turm."
05-02-2021T16:34:25,BadFoMo,*term
05-02-2021T16:34:34,BadFoMo,"Also, Hi."
05-02-2021T16:34:59,AspiringNoodle,If I've learned anything from anime
05-02-2021T16:35:26,AspiringNoodle,It's that complex spell circles with cryptic symbols make magic 9001x cooler :D
05-02-2021T16:35:37,BadFoMo,"""Nailing people to the sky""? So Mike's going to be stuck there?"
05-02-2021T16:35:44,Roughlandin,"Afternoon, Sage + everybody!"
05-02-2021T16:35:52,BadFoMo,Yo.
05-02-2021T16:36:03,Roughlandin,Hi FoMo!
05-02-2021T16:36:51,Roughlandin,Looks like Team Mike is blasting off agaaaaaa- *pwink.*
05-02-2021T16:37:12,SageSaga,"nail to the sky is a fun way of saying ""orbit"""
05-02-2021T16:37:19,BadFoMo,Ah.
05-02-2021T16:37:41,Ordithus,ill advised unless you have spaceship
05-02-2021T16:37:51,SageSaga,it takes you far enough above that you continuously fall and miss the earth XD
05-02-2021T16:38:10,BadFoMo,Cool.
05-02-2021T16:38:53,Roughlandin,So much of astrophysics is just the art of creative falling
05-02-2021T16:39:40,Ordithus,o/ rough
05-02-2021T16:39:46,Roughlandin,Hoi hoi Ord!
05-02-2021T16:40:43,johnnytho,new glasses rough?
05-02-2021T16:40:58,Roughlandin,Yeppers! Happy Valentine's Day!
05-02-2021T16:41:09,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-Echolove: basically
05-02-2021T16:41:13,Roughlandin,Ye!
05-02-2021T16:42:47,Roughlandin,Made Valentine's card boxes with the niece and nephews today. T'was an... event
05-02-2021T16:42:58,johnnytho,cute
05-02-2021T16:43:08,Roughlandin,"By the end, yeah lol"
05-02-2021T16:43:15,Twokinds,It's valentine's day?
05-02-2021T16:43:21,Roughlandin,In a week
05-02-2021T16:43:26,ZapiliDver,Hi Rough
05-02-2021T16:43:33,Roughlandin,Hi Zap!
05-02-2021T16:43:45,SpazztasticKiwi,you ever had someone get mad at you for not talking to them
05-02-2021T16:43:53,johnnytho,I thought so for a sec too Tom
05-02-2021T16:44:24,Roughlandin,"Like, just in passing or late return text, Kiwi?"
05-02-2021T16:44:40,Roughlandin,Because I'm awful about texting people back in a timely fashion lol
05-02-2021T16:45:44,SpazztasticKiwi,at work
05-02-2021T16:46:02,Roughlandin,A customer or a co-worker?
05-02-2021T16:51:39,SageSaga,i remember going up to a classmate in college and tried talking to him- and he responded with some nonsense and was not looking at me
05-02-2021T16:51:50,SageSaga,"and i was like ""what? I dont understand-"""
05-02-2021T16:52:36,SageSaga,and he then pulled back his hair and showed he had an ear piece on and went back to talking to the person on his fancy earpiece phone (in 2003)
05-02-2021T16:52:51,SageSaga,"and i said ""oh sorry- didnt know you were rich- my bad, bye"""
05-02-2021T16:53:06,Ordithus,lol
05-02-2021T16:53:19,Roughlandin,Haha
05-02-2021T16:53:28,SageSaga,"and he laughed so hard and then said ""No - sorry man- classmate didnt know i was on the phone with you- said something really funny- i'll call ya back"""
05-02-2021T16:53:46,SageSaga,and we chatted about our class for a bit
05-02-2021T16:59:11,Twokinds,debating whether I should stream
05-02-2021T16:59:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Gotta coin?
05-02-2021T17:00:16,SageSaga,if its the comic - despite appreciating the extra eyes you will bring to my work atm i dont think you should XD
05-02-2021T17:01:17,Roughlandin,ABS - Always Be Streaming
05-02-2021T17:01:44,SageSaga,but if it helps you focus and you need that focus to get your work done- go ahead and do it
05-02-2021T17:01:59,SageSaga,i know im generally a bit more focused when i stream
05-02-2021T17:02:05,Twokinds,nah if you think so
05-02-2021T17:03:06,SageSaga,my phone just dinged with your message on discord XD
05-02-2021T17:10:25,SpazztasticKiwi,nah I mean that I talk to myself
05-02-2021T17:10:57,SpazztasticKiwi,most notably at work & I don’t start conversation unless I have something to say nor do I engage unless talked to or I have something to say
05-02-2021T17:11:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"the other girl here has been hearing me talk to myself & thinking I’m talking to her but no, I tell her I’m just going over what I’m doing and what I have to do next"
05-02-2021T17:11:41,Roughlandin,I mean it is work. Sometimes other stuff takes priority over socializing
05-02-2021T17:12:37,Roughlandin,Tell her to mind her business! >_<
05-02-2021T17:12:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve worked here for coming up on 3 years & I actively talk to the cake decorator more because I’ve known her as long; the other lady that just left is just as nice and comfortable to talk to
05-02-2021T17:12:48,SageSaga,uuh Rough-
05-02-2021T17:13:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I guess she thinks that I’ve been talking to everybody else and ignoring her
05-02-2021T17:13:12,SageSaga,that's bad advice rough
05-02-2021T17:13:38,SageSaga,people talking to themselves in public is unusual
05-02-2021T17:13:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"which I mean I guess but it’s like I said, I talk when talked to or have something to add, if I don’t have something to say to start with"
05-02-2021T17:14:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t force conversation
05-02-2021T17:14:18,SageSaga,i dunno about that-
05-02-2021T17:14:26,SageSaga,you did bring all this up yourself here :P
05-02-2021T17:14:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I asked a question
05-02-2021T17:14:43,SageSaga,. . .
05-02-2021T17:14:46,SpazztasticKiwi,as part of a discussion
05-02-2021T17:15:02,SageSaga,is that not how people start conversations?
05-02-2021T17:15:03,SpazztasticKiwi,you’re telling me you don’t talk to yourself when you’re at the store shopping
05-02-2021T17:15:13,SageSaga,i do it in my head
05-02-2021T17:15:18,SageSaga,like a sane person O_O
05-02-2021T17:15:19,SpazztasticKiwi,does that mean you’re saying I’m forcing a conversation on you
05-02-2021T17:15:46,SageSaga,i would argue yes - i would also say forcing a conversation isnt a bad thing
05-02-2021T17:16:12,SpazztasticKiwi,nevermind
05-02-2021T17:16:26,Roughlandin,Sometimes saying what you need to do out loud helps with memorizing. *Shrugs.*
05-02-2021T17:17:20,SageSaga,yes but its weird to do around people - and if someone mistakes you talking to them- you dont really have any right to be mad or rude to them
05-02-2021T17:17:32,SageSaga,like you suggested Rough
05-02-2021T17:17:47,Roughlandin,I was joking lol
05-02-2021T17:18:42,Ordithus,no one jokes on the internet
05-02-2021T17:18:47,Roughlandin,Never actually pay attention to my advice. I'm a man that pretends to be a bear on the internet. Not exactly a self help clinic lol
05-02-2021T17:20:23,SageSaga,someone in the kitchen decided to play music on my google device - which took over my spotify
05-02-2021T17:20:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Thus began the music wars
05-02-2021T17:21:22,Ordithus,blast them with full volume weeb
05-02-2021T17:21:45,SageSaga,i gotta move that device into my room
05-02-2021T17:21:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Rock the house with the inspirational power that is the Gurren Laggan opening
05-02-2021T17:22:08,SageSaga,its a google max so that would darn near blow out their eardrums if they were near it at max volume XD
05-02-2021T17:22:30,Roughlandin,Max to the max
05-02-2021T17:24:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"That, just sounds like Ideal listening conditions for Sorairo Days"
05-02-2021T17:25:11,Roughlandin,The Metal version of Toss a Coin isn't the worst thing to listen to haha
05-02-2021T17:25:44,Ordithus,only version I've heard~
05-02-2021T17:26:07,Roughlandin,The version from the series is pretty good too. Certainly an earworm
05-02-2021T17:26:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Oh, Rumble the house with Jonathan Young's cover of ultimate battle"
05-02-2021T17:26:42,ZapiliDver,"""I don't always listen to Rammstein, but when i do so do my neighbours"""
05-02-2021T17:27:17,Roughlandin,Or his version of Unravel
05-02-2021T17:28:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I guess that makes about everyone or every other person that works here weird
05-02-2021T17:28:13,SpazztasticKiwi,we all do it
05-02-2021T17:28:49,SageSaga,in public outloud?
05-02-2021T17:29:00,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s what I said
05-02-2021T17:29:18,Ordithus,could be a bit cultural
05-02-2021T17:29:21,SpazztasticKiwi,on the occasion
05-02-2021T17:29:28,Roughlandin,"If I still worked retail right now, I'd probably be a little weird myself"
05-02-2021T17:29:35,Roughlandin,"...Well, weirder than I already am"
05-02-2021T17:29:41,Ordithus,was about to say muahaha
05-02-2021T17:29:45,Roughlandin,XD
05-02-2021T17:30:06,Ordithus,like I'm one to talk
05-02-2021T17:31:01,Roughlandin,Us? Weird? We just like to socialize about how we all like pretty ladies with animal tails (and sometimes a cute fox boy or two...)
05-02-2021T17:31:06,SpazztasticKiwi,in any case I’ve yet to have someone be as rude about it or point it out
05-02-2021T17:32:26,Roughlandin,Meh. She'll get over it. Can't be as annoying as dealing with most customers
05-02-2021T17:33:16,SageSaga,eh i dont think you can blame someone for being upset about being embarased
05-02-2021T17:34:09,SpazztasticKiwi,her....embarrassed
05-02-2021T17:34:42,SageSaga,from how you described it- i try to put myself in both shoes-
05-02-2021T17:35:11,SpazztasticKiwi,did you miss the day she got bitchy with me because I called her out in a lie
05-02-2021T17:35:34,SageSaga,"if i thought someone was talking to me and it turned out they were talking to themselves- id be embarased- and then i would be like ""Who does that? Honestly! dont people think inside their heads?!"""
05-02-2021T17:36:22,SageSaga,just because someone can be rude or mean sometimes or seem that way doesnt mean they cant have other feelings
05-02-2021T17:36:51,SageSaga,maybe they are just a horrible rotten person- but ive rarely ever met someone that actually was- it's usually a matter of perspective
05-02-2021T17:37:25,SageSaga,some people lie on accident- some people see things so differently than others that they might actually think they are telling the truth
05-02-2021T17:37:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not the only one that’s noticed her......uniqueness
05-02-2021T17:37:55,SageSaga,this isnt about just your perspective- its about hers
05-02-2021T17:38:58,SageSaga,from her perspective you're a person that might be out to take her job away- she might be defensive which would make her act rude towards you and angry that someone so weird in her eyes is someone she is concerned about for herself
05-02-2021T17:39:14,SpazztasticKiwi,take her job away
05-02-2021T17:39:21,SageSaga,"she might be going home tonight and saying ""That crazy woman is talking to herself and trying to get me fired!"""
05-02-2021T17:39:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"if she doesn’t want to do something, she’s been known to say she doesn’t know how"
05-02-2021T17:40:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"in my experience with her, if I explain something to her & she doesn’t like my answers, I have an attitude"
05-02-2021T17:40:21,SageSaga,"""I cant believe this is happening! Why does that girl hate me so much?!"""
05-02-2021T17:40:46,SpazztasticKiwi,she has actively raised her voice over mine or walked away rolling her eyes when I try showing her something
05-02-2021T17:40:54,SageSaga,"""look at her- on her phone - probably making fun of me!"""
05-02-2021T17:41:19,SpazztasticKiwi,excuse the hell out of me for not being the welcoming committee to someone like that
05-02-2021T17:42:08,SageSaga,*sigh* i guess some people just cant even try to understand eachother
05-02-2021T17:42:18,SpazztasticKiwi,tell you what
05-02-2021T17:42:58,SpazztasticKiwi,have someone do that to you - repeatedly - and see if you’ll have absolutely no problem still being best friends
05-02-2021T17:43:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not the only one that’s flagged this behavior with her before
05-02-2021T17:43:23,SageSaga,<_< i have done this
05-02-2021T17:44:26,SageSaga,ive dealt with stuff like this often- sometimes you find someone that you just cant handle or understand- sure- but i find most of the time if they can be reasonable you can find some common ground to understand eachother from
05-02-2021T17:44:49,SpazztasticKiwi,you realize I’ve talked to her before when we’ve had a problem
05-02-2021T17:44:55,SpazztasticKiwi,it just happens again
05-02-2021T17:44:57,SageSaga,one of my best friends and I do this all the time- but through the years we've found ways to get around it
05-02-2021T17:46:01,SpazztasticKiwi,you and I are also different people too aren’t we
05-02-2021T17:46:24,SpazztasticKiwi,and will also respond and act differently to any given occurrence
05-02-2021T17:47:08,SageSaga,yep- but i believe its possible- and we are only getting your side of events - so i dont like seeing people getting angry with you and creating an echo chamber
05-02-2021T17:47:32,SageSaga,she might just be a trash person! Yep! It's possible! But i dont want to enforce that thought for you
05-02-2021T17:47:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I never said or insinuating she was
05-02-2021T17:48:08,SpazztasticKiwi,as I’ve discussed with others before when noting her behavior
05-02-2021T17:48:12,SageSaga,well thats the feeling i got with- all of this
05-02-2021T17:48:24,SpazztasticKiwi,she’s cool in all honesty
05-02-2021T17:48:53,SageSaga,you said she was rude and a liar
05-02-2021T17:49:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"she is, has been"
05-02-2021T17:49:28,SpazztasticKiwi,but remember I said it was when she didn’t want to do something
05-02-2021T17:49:38,SpazztasticKiwi,so she lied about it and having to do it
05-02-2021T17:50:01,Ordithus,laziness coping mechanism maybe
05-02-2021T17:50:14,Ordithus,don't wanna --> don't know how
05-02-2021T17:50:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"and then when I tried showing her how, rolled her eyes, talked over me, and walked away to a customer, cutting me off and cutting my attempt at assistance off"
05-02-2021T17:50:32,SageSaga,so- you understand that by telling us about her being a liar and being a rude person- we would all assume you are telling the truth and we would not like this person- who you now say is a cool person?
05-02-2021T17:51:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"that is her problem, resistance to correction"
05-02-2021T17:51:17,SpazztasticKiwi,she doesn’t like to feel or look stupid
05-02-2021T17:51:58,SageSaga,i know very few people who do like feeling stupid
05-02-2021T17:52:08,SageSaga,and i think its more of a weird fetish thing-
05-02-2021T17:52:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"but what’s the logic in doing something like that to someone who tries to fix the problem, to teach you how to do what you said you couldn’t do"
05-02-2021T17:53:41,RedDragonSyndicate,Yo!
05-02-2021T17:53:56,SageSaga,yo Red
05-02-2021T17:54:07,SageSaga,here to say hi and run away again?!
05-02-2021T17:54:08,RedDragonSyndicate,that expression on my favorite Nekomata is a mood
05-02-2021T17:54:16,Ordithus,o/ red
05-02-2021T17:54:34,RedDragonSyndicate,I'm not running - just get distracted XD
05-02-2021T17:54:40,RedDragonSyndicate,video games :|
05-02-2021T17:54:53,SageSaga,:csagesaga-nynastare:
05-02-2021T17:55:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I find it hard to believe someone wants to be my friend or work friends when we have interactions like that
05-02-2021T17:55:37,SageSaga,past 2 streams you showed up for you said hi- and i asked you a question- and you never came back O_O I even PMed you! N-Not like im upset or anything! S-Stupid!
05-02-2021T17:55:39,RedDragonSyndicate,I'm sorry :ptv-uneasy:
05-02-2021T17:55:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"so yes, she’s cool, and I’ve told her she’s pretty because she is"
05-02-2021T17:55:51,RedDragonSyndicate,and I didn't get those PMs
05-02-2021T17:55:57,RedDragonSyndicate,Picarto is crap for me on that
05-02-2021T17:57:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"other than this odd thing she has when guidance for the job comes up, I like her"
05-02-2021T17:58:23,SageSaga,So Red- you play D&D at all? I cant remember if ya said you had or not-
05-02-2021T17:58:50,RedDragonSyndicate,"I have, but not a lot of it. I do enjoy it and I used to follow CR pretty regularly (though I'm like a year behind now)"
05-02-2021T17:59:55,SageSaga,so if you were to be dragged into the D&D world- what class and race would you want to be? Oh and Sex because you could choose that too and some people want to try something new XD
05-02-2021T18:00:39,Ordithus,ah yes this question
05-02-2021T18:00:48,TeapotOfDoom,oh hello

05-02-2021T18:02:19,SageSaga,T_T it was sad
05-02-2021T18:02:20,TeapotOfDoom,oh god
05-02-2021T18:02:25,TeapotOfDoom,oh how so?
05-02-2021T18:02:32,Ordithus,poor fluff!
05-02-2021T18:02:32,TeapotOfDoom,what happened?
05-02-2021T18:02:36,TeapotOfDoom,oh no!
05-02-2021T18:02:38,TeapotOfDoom,did he die?
05-02-2021T18:02:39,SageSaga,well it was his own fault
05-02-2021T18:02:47,Ordithus,what will rei do
05-02-2021T18:02:47,SageSaga,who walks up to a medusa?! honestly!
05-02-2021T18:02:55,TeapotOfDoom,oh boi xD
05-02-2021T18:02:59,TeapotOfDoom,oh nooo
05-02-2021T18:03:15,TeapotOfDoom,i thought he was immortal? xD
05-02-2021T18:03:24,SageSaga,that game ended
05-02-2021T18:03:25,SpazztasticKiwi,but now I have a few minutes & lunch is over but as of the last interaction with her it seems I’ll be ignored
05-02-2021T18:03:28,SageSaga,new game!
05-02-2021T18:03:30,TeapotOfDoom,oh ok lol
05-02-2021T18:03:39,TeapotOfDoom,how many sessions till he died?
05-02-2021T18:03:53,SageSaga,this  was i think session 4 or 5-
05-02-2021T18:03:58,SageSaga,i think it was 4
05-02-2021T18:04:01,TeapotOfDoom,well done sir xD
05-02-2021T18:04:16,Ordithus,spazz just what is your avatar there
05-02-2021T18:04:16,TeapotOfDoom,her looks were quite stunning
05-02-2021T18:04:29,SpazztasticKiwi,right before leaving I’d explained that I was sorting the chickens under the bar & wed soon have room to spread them out because we’re out of one flavor
05-02-2021T18:04:53,SpazztasticKiwi,& she apparently thinks I don’t want to talk to her cause she said I didn’t if I didn’t want to
05-02-2021T18:04:59,SageSaga,seriously- after 4 rounds of people keeping their distance and saying dont get near her or look in her eyes! - who walks up to her and looks in her eyes?!
05-02-2021T18:05:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m pretty sure it’s a geode
05-02-2021T18:05:22,TeapotOfDoom,fluff
05-02-2021T18:05:27,TeapotOfDoom,apparently xD
05-02-2021T18:05:33,Ordithus,from a distance it looks  like a spooky ghost or something
05-02-2021T18:05:46,Ordithus,"fluff: ""for science!"""
05-02-2021T18:05:59,TeapotOfDoom,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
05-02-2021T18:06:02,SageSaga,oh is that the cookie monster geode?
05-02-2021T18:06:07,TeapotOfDoom,honestly i find this very amusing
05-02-2021T18:06:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m tired of me being quieter than the dead at times being taken as an insult
05-02-2021T18:07:28,SageSaga,Red has vanished again
05-02-2021T18:07:36,SageSaga,so like him
05-02-2021T18:07:45,SageSaga,*tsk tsk*
05-02-2021T18:07:48,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-LauraCry:
05-02-2021T18:08:18,TeapotOfDoom,what kind of chacter was the now late fluff anyway?
05-02-2021T18:08:27,Ordithus,some folks don't get quiet people
05-02-2021T18:08:35,SpazztasticKiwi,apparently
05-02-2021T18:08:37,Ordithus,just like I don't get loud people!
05-02-2021T18:08:44,TeapotOfDoom,:cteapotofdoom-reni_rotate:
05-02-2021T18:08:53,SageSaga,Fluff was a Warforged Paladin
05-02-2021T18:09:02,TeapotOfDoom,ohhh
05-02-2021T18:09:09,TeapotOfDoom,iiinteresting
05-02-2021T18:09:22,TeapotOfDoom,i've never actually seen a warforged pc in game
05-02-2021T18:09:29,TeapotOfDoom,oh nvm i have
05-02-2021T18:09:38,TeapotOfDoom,they were just named differently
05-02-2021T18:10:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve yet to have someone take it so personally
05-02-2021T18:10:44,SpazztasticKiwi,either
05-02-2021T18:10:47,RedDragonSyndicate,"Sorry - got pulled away briefly (lmao) Female, Tiefling, Spellblade"
05-02-2021T18:11:16,SpazztasticKiwi,but clearly the conversation has been moved to more interesting things so
05-02-2021T18:11:17,Hogan,"Alright, time to head off and see my bed about some sleep..."
05-02-2021T18:11:22,Hogan,Thanks for the entertainment and company! :D
05-02-2021T18:11:27,SageSaga,no spellblades in 5e
05-02-2021T18:11:29,Ordithus,night hogan
05-02-2021T18:11:35,TeapotOfDoom,Hexblades tho
05-02-2021T18:11:43,TeapotOfDoom,night hogan
05-02-2021T18:11:48,RedDragonSyndicate,Then some kinda Rogue XD
05-02-2021T18:12:21,SageSaga,there are hexblades which are warlocks and Bladesingers that are wizards
05-02-2021T18:12:38,RedDragonSyndicate,Hexblade
05-02-2021T18:12:50,Ordithus,and there are bards that can do everything
05-02-2021T18:13:07,SageSaga,yep- bards do all the things
05-02-2021T18:13:09,TeapotOfDoom,also probably Wizard for me (i am a nerd and proud of it) and probably changeling cus choosing is for chumps lol
05-02-2021T18:13:31,TeapotOfDoom,bards do everything and everyone
05-02-2021T18:13:54,Ordithus,ohmy
05-02-2021T18:14:00,SageSaga,what kinda Tiefling?
05-02-2021T18:14:05,TeapotOfDoom,or bard i dunno. i like playing music
05-02-2021T18:15:45,RedDragonSyndicate,"Mephistopheles - they're the fire flavored, yes?"
05-02-2021T18:16:31,TeapotOfDoom,:ctwokinds-laura::fire:
05-02-2021T18:17:17,RedDragonSyndicate,I'm all about the fire
05-02-2021T18:17:20,RedDragonSyndicate,:creddragonsyndicate-c2:
05-02-2021T18:17:51,SageSaga,yep- thats them
05-02-2021T18:17:56,SageSaga,so no wings :P
05-02-2021T18:18:36,RedDragonSyndicate,no wings XD
05-02-2021T18:19:39,SageSaga,the other tiefling in the group has wings and black skin
05-02-2021T18:20:13,SageSaga,he's also a Chaotic good Necromancer XD
05-02-2021T18:21:00,SageSaga,man - every freakn time i think of a Necromancer in D&D im reminded of that meme
05-02-2021T18:21:24,TeapotOfDoom,which one
05-02-2021T18:21:30,TeapotOfDoom,also who's the tiefling?
05-02-2021T18:21:45,Ordithus,a good necromancer?!
05-02-2021T18:21:51,SageSaga,"""I must avenge my brother- who will help me?"" ""you have my bow!"" ""And you have my sword!"" ""And you have your brother!"" *zombie brother ready to fight!*"
05-02-2021T18:22:03,Ordithus,aaaaa haha
05-02-2021T18:23:50,TeapotOfDoom,oh that one xD
05-02-2021T18:24:16,SageSaga,it legit gets me every time
05-02-2021T18:24:19,RedDragonSyndicate,lol
05-02-2021T18:24:55,SageSaga,but having a level 20 necromancer on your side is- AWESOME
05-02-2021T18:25:07,TeapotOfDoom,the class of noone dies
05-02-2021T18:26:28,TeapotOfDoom,so who is the tiefling in the group?
05-02-2021T18:26:29,SageSaga,one of the greatest threats in D&D to high level players are really powerful undead such as . . . Nightstalkers
05-02-2021T18:27:02,TeapotOfDoom,checks stats
05-02-2021T18:27:08,SageSaga,this is a different group - and its a group of over 20 people
05-02-2021T18:27:15,TeapotOfDoom,uwot
05-02-2021T18:27:20,TeapotOfDoom,20 people???
05-02-2021T18:27:32,SageSaga,nightwalker*
05-02-2021T18:27:49,TeapotOfDoom,cr20 O_O
05-02-2021T18:27:52,TeapotOfDoom,oh boi
05-02-2021T18:28:04,SageSaga,and soul destroying
05-02-2021T18:28:29,SageSaga,however- a level 20 Necromancer has a 100% method of completely negating a Nightwalker
05-02-2021T18:28:41,SageSaga,control undead
05-02-2021T18:28:42,TeapotOfDoom,"""by any means short of a wish spell"" you know when those words are in there, it's serious"
05-02-2021T18:28:45,Ordithus,:eyes: claws wow
05-02-2021T18:29:50,SageSaga,at level 20 they can have a DC of over 19- and a nightstalker - even if they roll a 20 - only gets a 19
05-02-2021T18:29:59,TeapotOfDoom,dang
05-02-2021T18:30:22,SageSaga,that also means- a Necromancer can have  pet Nightwalker XD
05-02-2021T18:31:08,TeapotOfDoom,"now i imagine a necromancer riding on the shoulder of a nightwalker screaming ""Onwards Aoshima!"" :ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:"
05-02-2021T18:32:57,SageSaga,so yeah- a Necromancer completely negates Nightwalkers
05-02-2021T18:33:08,Ordithus,"if a pet isn't cute, it should at least be useful"
05-02-2021T18:34:04,TeapotOfDoom,"the attack name ""Finger of Doom"" is kind of cynical"
05-02-2021T18:34:07,TeapotOfDoom,oh boi
05-02-2021T18:34:34,SageSaga,"they are also great for cleaning up after a battle ""Ok im gonna animate all the corpses so they can dig their own graves"""
05-02-2021T18:34:52,TeapotOfDoom,:cteapotofdoom-kumipog:
05-02-2021T18:35:16,TeapotOfDoom,"""With me, you're always digging your own grave."""
05-02-2021T18:37:39,SageSaga,but yeah- im gonna add Red to the Roster of NPC friends :P
05-02-2021T18:39:50,Ordithus,"If I had to go to dndland, might be fun to be an elf artificer. basically an engineer/blacksmith, yeah?"
05-02-2021T18:39:53,AspiringNoodle,I'm curious about how Diablo handles Necromancers
05-02-2021T18:40:22,AspiringNoodle,"Ran into one in a random scenario.  He was dying, but he attempting to destroy a dangerous spirit."
05-02-2021T18:40:54,TeapotOfDoom,oh i forgot about the aging thing... being a race that lives very long would be very interesting
05-02-2021T18:41:30,AspiringNoodle,I'd have to dig into the lore of WoW
05-02-2021T18:41:52,AspiringNoodle,But Elves and Draenei can live for tens of thousands of years.
05-02-2021T18:42:27,SageSaga,"Artificers have 4 options- Battlesmith, Armorer, Artilerist, and Alchemist"
05-02-2021T18:42:36,AspiringNoodle,I'm sure they tackled the issue of their super long lives vs more human-like lives at some point.
05-02-2021T18:43:02,AspiringNoodle,What does a Battlesmith do?
05-02-2021T18:43:18,TeapotOfDoom,i think we have an artillerist in our party and it's so weird
05-02-2021T18:43:24,TeapotOfDoom,we just have a cannon
05-02-2021T18:43:32,Ordithus,lol same
05-02-2021T18:43:44,SageSaga,battlesmith does enchanting and builds a metal buddy
05-02-2021T18:43:55,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-ohmy:
05-02-2021T18:43:56,Ordithus,sweet
05-02-2021T18:44:12,AspiringNoodle,So you can literally forge a Destroyer?!
05-02-2021T18:44:21,TeapotOfDoom,like a middle aged campaign with a freaking cannon named None after the german word for it which is Kanone
05-02-2021T18:44:31,SageSaga,i mean- if by metal puppy you mean destroyer- sure?
05-02-2021T18:44:37,AspiringNoodle,Awwww
05-02-2021T18:44:48,AspiringNoodle,I was thinking like THE Destroyer.  From the first Thor film?
05-02-2021T18:44:53,TeapotOfDoom,(i wanna see a warforged druid ngl)
05-02-2021T18:44:53,SageSaga,actually i think the creature you make can get pretty big and ferocious XD
05-02-2021T18:45:18,AspiringNoodle,"""I have an army, what do you have?"""
05-02-2021T18:45:27,Ordithus,armorer also looks cool
05-02-2021T18:45:30,AspiringNoodle,"""I have this guy"" *points over shoulder*"
05-02-2021T18:45:32,SageSaga,thats more like what the Armorer creates Noodle
05-02-2021T18:45:45,SageSaga,though the Armorer is more Iron Man
05-02-2021T18:46:02,TeapotOfDoom,artificer is so weird
05-02-2021T18:46:05,AspiringNoodle,Can the Armorer create a semi-sentient suit of armor?
05-02-2021T18:46:23,TeapotOfDoom,like the concept is interesting but the way it's mostly played is just weird
05-02-2021T18:46:24,AspiringNoodle,"""I like to let my work speak for itself <3"""
05-02-2021T18:46:31,SageSaga,yes- but technically they all can- the Armorer just gets special traits only they can get
05-02-2021T18:47:21,SageSaga,i prefer the traditional artificer from 3.5 Eberron
05-02-2021T18:47:28,SageSaga,but they were broken until the errata
05-02-2021T18:47:32,TeapotOfDoom,never read that
05-02-2021T18:47:34,AspiringNoodle,"i'll look into that, haha"
05-02-2021T18:47:49,AspiringNoodle,I like the idea of just having this hulking suit of armor walking around to do my dirty work
05-02-2021T18:48:02,SageSaga,"""I took these feats to reduce the time it takes to make magic items"" ""oh cool how long does it take no-"" ""Done- i made 5 items"""
05-02-2021T18:48:22,AspiringNoodle,:ptv-shock: That was fast!
05-02-2021T18:48:47,SageSaga,"""Lemme see that- 25% off total time, 50% off, and. . . 25% off- that's 100% reduction-"""

05-02-2021T18:50:11,SageSaga,"""Yeah those dont stack like that- if you have them all reduce time by 75% no more!"""
05-02-2021T18:55:07,SageSaga,but what made artificers cool back then was they had greatly improved abilities to just make magic items quickly and even on the fly that were very useful - and were decent combatants and spellcasters
05-02-2021T18:55:27,SageSaga,never as powerful as a wizard but not as weak as a paladin or rangers spellcasting
05-02-2021T18:55:53,SageSaga,and their versatility with items was just awesome- they could even change their enchantments on the fly
05-02-2021T18:56:24,SageSaga,turning a +3 sword into a +1 Bane of Undead Flaming sword
05-02-2021T18:56:50,SageSaga,you know- for when you wanna kill a lich
05-02-2021T18:57:16,Ordithus,handy!
05-02-2021T18:57:45,TeapotOfDoom,now we have
05-02-2021T18:57:47,TeapotOfDoom,uhm
05-02-2021T18:57:49,TeapotOfDoom,guns!
05-02-2021T18:58:12,SageSaga,well- barely even that
05-02-2021T18:58:27,SageSaga,the artilerist gets like TF2 Engineer Turrets!
05-02-2021T18:58:48,TeapotOfDoom,lol that actually is accurately painful xD
05-02-2021T18:59:01,SageSaga,an older version of the unfinished 5e Artificer had a magic shotgun! it was awsome! but they got rid of it- too awesome XD
05-02-2021T18:59:03,TeapotOfDoom,or painfully accurate
05-02-2021T18:59:38,TeapotOfDoom,i think magic guns in dnd are kind of stupid. why would people fight with swords if you have guns?
05-02-2021T18:59:45,TeapotOfDoom,kills the whole appeal imo
05-02-2021T19:00:08,Ordithus,guns and swords existed a long time alongside each other in history
05-02-2021T19:00:34,SageSaga,"because magic guns dont work great, are super expensive and usually require you to know a lot about them to keep them working"
05-02-2021T19:00:34,Ordithus,swords were still battlefield weapons into the late 1800s. Even the earely 1900s...
05-02-2021T19:01:04,SageSaga,"regular guns dont work in most D&D worlds because the elemental ""god"" of fire eats most of the energy as an offering to him"
05-02-2021T19:01:13,Ordithus,rude
05-02-2021T19:01:29,SageSaga,objects you burn are an offering to the primal elemental XD
05-02-2021T19:01:40,SageSaga,he takes a small portion of the energy as power
05-02-2021T19:01:56,Ordithus,pretty easy to get this god's favor then. I'm burning a candle right now!
05-02-2021T19:02:00,SageSaga,that chunk he takes out of full on gunpowder nerfs it super heavily
05-02-2021T19:02:03,Ordithus,and my furnace makes plenty of fire
05-02-2021T19:02:08,SageSaga,so most guns have to use smoke powder
05-02-2021T19:02:37,SageSaga,hes not really a god though- he doesnt care at all for humanity
05-02-2021T19:02:55,SageSaga,that spark and fire- that is what is worshiping and offering to him- not you - meat bag
05-02-2021T19:03:09,Ordithus,lol
05-02-2021T19:03:32,Ordithus,-me- burning is not appealing to me
05-02-2021T19:05:18,TeapotOfDoom,what if you ignite yourself
05-02-2021T19:05:21,TeapotOfDoom,does that count
05-02-2021T19:06:00,SageSaga,the fire is offering you as a sacrifice then
05-02-2021T19:06:07,SageSaga,good fire- burn- consume
05-02-2021T19:06:16,TeapotOfDoom,:ctwokinds-laura:
05-02-2021T19:09:25,Ordithus,:eyes: lots of effects this page
05-02-2021T19:09:40,TeapotOfDoom,effects are ... effective
05-02-2021T19:10:04,TeapotOfDoom,his forearm is a lil thicc
05-02-2021T19:13:06,Ordithus,spaceship doesn't have power steering for sporty handling
05-02-2021T19:13:28,TeapotOfDoom,STRONG HEAPING MUSCLE
05-02-2021T19:13:44,BadFoMo,The kid's eyes remind me of Fryloc's eye's in Aqua Teen Hunger Force's first episode where he calls down a beam to take Carl to work; ...which is his home ...which he is standing right next to.
05-02-2021T19:13:58,TeapotOfDoom,much better
05-02-2021T19:14:36,SageSaga,ty
05-02-2021T19:14:48,TeapotOfDoom,those magic effects look sick btw
05-02-2021T19:14:54,SageSaga,his limbs and most of his torso are all cybernetic XD
05-02-2021T19:14:57,SageSaga,ty
05-02-2021T19:16:32,Ordithus,curious to see his world

05-02-2021T21:38:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark’s chipotle order from that one stream was the most attractive sounding garbage I’d heard
05-02-2021T21:39:13,SpazztasticKiwi,should I get in a chipotle I aim to try it

05-02-2021T21:40:10,Roughlandin,I like Chipotle. I like Qdoba better but Chipotle is good too
05-02-2021T21:40:31,Roughlandin,Various tasty meats and toppings in a tortilla. Can't go wrong
05-02-2021T21:40:33,CrRAR,I've heard good things about Qdoba
05-02-2021T21:40:58,Ordithus,both are tasty enough
05-02-2021T21:41:06,Roughlandin,Only problem is the assembly line nature of the place makes it hard to order for more than one person
05-02-2021T21:41:18,Roughlandin,But I think you can order online now
05-02-2021T21:41:35,Ordithus,that's all I've done the past year. online order and takeout
05-02-2021T21:41:41,Roughlandin,Same
05-02-2021T21:42:07,Roughlandin,"If you have to go in to get it, I'm picking somewhere with curbside or delivery"
05-02-2021T21:55:00,Ordithus,"yeah now that dine in is an option again here, I'm going to just make my own meals more"
05-02-2021T21:57:42,Roughlandin,I get Blue Apron for 2 nights a week. Honestly it costs about as much per meal as going out and it's made me a better cook in the process lol

05-02-2021T22:03:51,CrRAR,intuition is valuable
05-02-2021T22:04:21,CrRAR,someone being shifty?
05-02-2021T22:06:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I met a friend’s boyfriend yesterday
05-02-2021T22:07:14,Roughlandin,Ah. Eh first meetings can be awkward
05-02-2021T22:08:28,Roughlandin,How was she? Was she acting different when he was around than we you normally hand out?
05-02-2021T22:15:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I find no interaction with new people awkward
05-02-2021T22:15:52,Roughlandin,What was he doing that was giving you a bad vibe?
05-02-2021T22:15:53,SpazztasticKiwi,dude had a comment for everything she did or said
05-02-2021T22:16:11,Roughlandin,Like snarky or just input?

05-02-2021T22:17:33,Roughlandin,How was she? Was she laughing it off or did she seem uncomfortable?
05-02-2021T22:18:00,SpazztasticKiwi,she more or less ignored it all from what I noticed
05-02-2021T22:18:17,SpazztasticKiwi,could be how they are
05-02-2021T22:18:35,CrRAR,yeah relationship dynamics can be weird
05-02-2021T22:18:46,CrRAR,hopefully she's headstrong enough to set him straight
05-02-2021T22:19:16,CrRAR,"cuz if it bothers someone enough, tolerance only lasts so long"
05-02-2021T22:19:34,SpazztasticKiwi,like she had her coat on backwards just covering her arms & he hovered like “hey that’s not how you wear a coat”

05-02-2021T22:22:10,SpazztasticKiwi,not much
05-02-2021T22:22:29,SpazztasticKiwi,now that I think about it he didn’t keep too much eye contact with me
05-02-2021T22:22:46,CrRAR,did he have somewhere to go?
05-02-2021T22:22:57,CrRAR,or was it just a whole-time thing?
05-02-2021T22:22:57,SpazztasticKiwi,we all left when it was over
05-02-2021T22:23:04,Roughlandin,"Like I said, some people can be shy around new people. Maybe it was just that"
05-02-2021T22:23:13,SpazztasticKiwi,he left at some point cause he had work tomorrow
05-02-2021T22:23:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I came over to the conversation with my coat halfway on wrong and he stopped
05-02-2021T22:24:10,CrRAR,"""Oh, look, now you have EVERYONE doing it!"""
05-02-2021T22:24:39,SpazztasticKiwi,he could’ve been unsure of me cause we’ve never met and that was all concerning that interaction
05-02-2021T22:24:56,CrRAR,hmm
05-02-2021T22:25:15,CrRAR,"yeah, need more data"
05-02-2021T22:25:32,CrRAR,one occation it's tough to draw a conclusion yet
05-02-2021T22:25:43,Roughlandin,Yeah could just be bad first impression. If he keeps being super nitpicky and controlling it's definitely concerning
05-02-2021T22:25:54,SpazztasticKiwi,one of the other friends tho....he was fun
05-02-2021T22:26:07,Roughlandin,Well at least there's that haha

05-02-2021T22:26:58,SpazztasticKiwi,“might be because it replaces oxygen”
05-02-2021T22:27:06,SpazztasticKiwi,*Continues doing it*
05-02-2021T22:27:08,Roughlandin,Your lungs... kinda need that

05-02-2021T22:28:19,CrRAR,Feeds off the attention maybe

05-02-2021T22:31:37,CrRAR,"yeah, gotta see if his behavior is consistent"
05-02-2021T22:32:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t hang out with her often
05-02-2021T22:32:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"she’s a friend but she was adopted by my friends guardian, aunt and uncle"
05-02-2021T22:33:14,Roughlandin,So like a friend of a friend
05-02-2021T22:33:14,SpazztasticKiwi,her mother surrendered her to them a few years ago
05-02-2021T22:33:27,SpazztasticKiwi,she’s 18 now
05-02-2021T22:33:37,CrRAR,"ah, okay"
05-02-2021T22:34:01,CrRAR,"but yeah, maybe just stay in touch with her in case she needs someone to talk to?"
05-02-2021T22:34:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I have my eye on him for the age factor & I don’t know if he’s a few years older or actually her age
05-02-2021T22:34:46,SpazztasticKiwi,only because I found it weird
05-02-2021T22:34:57,CrRAR,are they newly a couple?
05-02-2021T22:35:07,SpazztasticKiwi,more or less
05-02-2021T22:35:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not too worried  - if she gets annoyed or tired of him she’ll likely leave him
05-02-2021T22:35:44,SpazztasticKiwi,and her guardians will step in if need be
05-02-2021T22:35:51,CrRAR,precisely
05-02-2021T22:35:57,SpazztasticKiwi,should he raise a flag around me though....
05-02-2021T22:36:04,Roughlandin,Yeah at least she has a good support network
05-02-2021T22:37:03,CrRAR,"yeah as long as she isn't in the relationship thinking ""one-and-only"" she'll probably recognize toxicity herself"
05-02-2021T22:37:38,CrRAR,"nit-pickyness constantly if it continues can sometimes be an attempt to, like, ""Stepford Wive"" someone."
05-02-2021T22:39:24,Roughlandin,"Good partners are good friends first. Good friends don't try to control you. If you wouldn't accept something from your friend, don't take it from your boyfriend/girlfriend"
05-02-2021T22:39:33,CrRAR,yup
05-02-2021T22:40:49,CrRAR,"I think if it came to it, confronting him (by her) would tell her a lot cuz based on his response whether it's ""oh I didn't know you felt that way, I'll change"" or ""eh, whatever"" is a huge sign if there's actual respect or not."
05-02-2021T22:41:20,CrRAR,basically the difference between a Prince Charming and a Chad.
05-02-2021T22:41:57,Roughlandin,Exactly. Without mutual respect stuff like that just doesn't work
05-02-2021T22:44:48,SpazztasticKiwi,they started dating in January
05-02-2021T22:44:53,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s 20
05-02-2021T22:45:03,SpazztasticKiwi,in November
05-02-2021T22:45:23,Roughlandin,He's 20 in November or they started dating in November?
05-02-2021T22:46:30,SpazztasticKiwi,.....“they started dating in January”
05-02-2021T22:47:30,Roughlandin,Ah. So he's 19 and she's 18. Not a huge age gap
05-02-2021T22:48:38,AspiringNoodle,*spies a bear*
05-02-2021T22:48:45,Roughlandin,Hoi

05-02-2021T22:51:55,SpazztasticKiwi,how much does a cat have to groom one single paw
05-02-2021T22:52:38,Roughlandin,:cat:*[It must be purrrrrrfect!]
05-02-2021T22:53:47,AspiringNoodle,*the kitty stops lick its paw for but a moment to stare at you*
05-02-2021T22:54:11,AspiringNoodle,"*while its expression doesn't change, you get the sense that it understood you*"
05-02-2021T22:54:33,AspiringNoodle,"*the kitty begins continuing to lick its paw, an air of spite lingers*"
05-02-2021T22:55:24,Roughlandin,"My cat has three moods: Judging you, cuddles, and wants food"
05-02-2021T23:04:32,Ordithus,until there is no more dirt
05-02-2021T23:04:38,Ordithus,but the paw is covered in spit
05-02-2021T23:04:42,Ordithus,must continue cleaning
05-02-2021T23:04:58,CrRAR,":ctwokinds-clovischuckle: judgement, yes"
