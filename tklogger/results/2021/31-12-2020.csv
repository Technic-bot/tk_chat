31-12-2020T00:10:09,CrRAR,2021 gettin real
31-12-2020T00:10:19,Dadrobit,Fireworks folks just arrived to the club.
31-12-2020T00:10:28,Dadrobit,2 more hours til the show
31-12-2020T00:10:49,CrRAR,Yeah guerrila fireworks goin on around here pretty good
31-12-2020T00:12:20,Dadrobit,My patrol guys are gonna get nothing productivodone tonight. Have to chase off anybody and everybody doing their own fireworks.
31-12-2020T00:12:55,Dadrobit,Technically the HOA has it as grounds for immediate eviction if anyone is caught.
31-12-2020T00:14:06,SpazztasticKiwi,at least in 2020 we got to see what a can of whoopass truly look like
31-12-2020T00:15:23,CrRAR,true the one single glimmer of some sort of cosmic justice
31-12-2020T00:16:13,CrRAR,"yeah, like the country needs more wildfires"
31-12-2020T00:17:00,CrRAR,I have SO much bacon for breakfast tomorrow
31-12-2020T00:17:13,CrRAR,:ccrrar-yis: 2021 starting off right
31-12-2020T00:17:42,CrRAR,:bacon:
31-12-2020T00:18:07,Dadrobit,And neighbors tend to become unruly after you burn down their their $20 million mansion.
31-12-2020T00:18:35,Dadrobit,"So, ya know, we gotta try to stop that from happening."
31-12-2020T00:18:41,CrRAR,"uh yeah, not to mention even all that ash and crap that rains down everywhere"
31-12-2020T00:24:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t like jalapeños
31-12-2020T00:24:45,SpazztasticKiwi,but I don’t like spicy food
31-12-2020T00:25:05,SpazztasticKiwi,the jalapeños on that pizza weren’t a bad idea but they didn’t do anything for flavor
31-12-2020T00:25:37,CrRAR,spice is just a destroyer of other flavors
31-12-2020T00:25:50,CrRAR,a great nullifier
31-12-2020T00:27:05,SpazztasticKiwi,it went good with the bites with olives & mushrooms but otherwise it was just
31-12-2020T00:27:07,SpazztasticKiwi,hot
31-12-2020T00:27:43,CrRAR,"on something with that many toppings too, the jalapenos are like undetectable landmines"
31-12-2020T00:28:12,SpazztasticKiwi,they’re full slices
31-12-2020T00:28:15,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-reniembarrassed: munchmunch... munch
31-12-2020T00:28:15,SpazztasticKiwi,you can see them
31-12-2020T00:28:20,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-renirawr:
31-12-2020T00:28:33,CrRAR,wait were the whole?
31-12-2020T00:28:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I wish there’d been more bell pepper too
31-12-2020T00:28:44,CrRAR,or like lil slicys?
31-12-2020T00:28:45,SpazztasticKiwi,s l i c e d
31-12-2020T00:29:05,CrRAR,ahhh
31-12-2020T00:29:27,CrRAR,yeah a feel like a steak bomb pizza would be amazing
31-12-2020T00:29:37,CrRAR,:cw0lfmare-Echolove:
31-12-2020T00:29:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to go to that Korean pizza place Mike Chen went to in la
31-12-2020T00:29:55,CrRAR,"stek, pepps, onionssss"
31-12-2020T00:30:11,CrRAR,mushies too probably!
31-12-2020T00:30:16,CrRAR,:ccrrar-stek:
31-12-2020T00:30:32,CrRAR,hecc yeah!
31-12-2020T00:30:50,CrRAR,is it just like bulgo gi on a pizza?
31-12-2020T00:31:25,CrRAR,that could make total sense esp if they do something like a sweeter sauce
31-12-2020T00:31:41,CrRAR,like with BBQ chik they do bbq for the sauce
31-12-2020T00:31:50,CrRAR,but not THAT sweet
31-12-2020T00:32:01,CrRAR,"something custom, more subtle"
31-12-2020T00:32:08,SpazztasticKiwi,...I shared it here awhile ago
31-12-2020T00:32:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom have you got your Christmas stuff down yet
31-12-2020T00:36:37,CrRAR,"I wish I had a steak bomb calzone right now, now"
31-12-2020T00:37:27,CrRAR,next pizza day I s'pose.
31-12-2020T00:37:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I wish I had a nice tall dark n handsome glass but we can’t get what we want can we
31-12-2020T00:38:01,CrRAR,fair's fair
31-12-2020T00:43:00,Dadrobit,"Next pizza is gonna be a pineapple, pepperoni, jalapeno. Gonna be mighty delicious."
31-12-2020T00:44:11,CrRAR,pineapple does sounds sweet and different enough to counteract the spicy
31-12-2020T00:44:52,CrRAR,maybe if that had BBQ sauce on it that's be interesting
31-12-2020T00:45:48,Dadrobit,Bbq would be too much sweet for my taste on top of the pineapple.
31-12-2020T00:45:48,SpazztasticKiwi,pineapple is made of a chemical that eats flesh
31-12-2020T00:46:02,CrRAR,Hawaiian BBQ pizza is a thing
31-12-2020T00:46:06,CrRAR,yeah true
31-12-2020T00:46:33,CrRAR,Kiwi fruit has an even stronger version of that enzyme.
31-12-2020T00:47:02,CrRAR,frickin strong kiwifruit it feels like your gums are like dissolving
31-12-2020T00:47:08,CrRAR,freaky stuff

31-12-2020T00:47:26,CrRAR,good secret ingredient as marinade as a meat tenderizer

31-12-2020T01:11:49,SpazztasticKiwi,ok bacon wrapped cheese stuffed mushrooms

31-12-2020T01:12:18,CrRAR,kinda like the zebra cakes
31-12-2020T01:13:00,CrRAR,I feel like bacon + crispie treat would just make the bacon more bacony
31-12-2020T01:13:16,Dadrobit,Suddenly hyper nostalgic for the dino bites riced krispies I made as a wee child 20 years back.... Hello deeply repressed memories.

31-12-2020T12:08:57,CrRAR,I would fill it with peppermints too
31-12-2020T12:09:06,CrRAR,bring balance to the universe
31-12-2020T12:09:38,SpazztasticKiwi,went in to get a mocha
31-12-2020T12:09:39,CrRAR,make it the go-to mug for mint hot chocolate
31-12-2020T12:09:50,CrRAR,nice
31-12-2020T12:10:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"got 2 mochas, 1 arizona tea, & a mug"
31-12-2020T12:11:00,CrRAR,:ccrrar-kathat: got kattfé here
31-12-2020T12:11:18,CrRAR,much better than covfefe
31-12-2020T12:12:16,CrRAR,I was on a mocha kick in the fall
31-12-2020T12:12:49,NinoGD,I need some coffee
31-12-2020T12:13:25,NinoGD,Only slept 2 about hours
31-12-2020T12:13:35,NinoGD,About 2 hours*
31-12-2020T12:13:55,CrRAR,probably like 5 for me
31-12-2020T12:14:10,CrRAR,but I doubt they were all high quality
31-12-2020T12:15:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I tell you what eye rinse is just the thing for a likely chemical burn to the eye
31-12-2020T12:15:44,CrRAR,Like is it a saline wash?
31-12-2020T12:15:58,SpazztasticKiwi,probably
31-12-2020T12:16:03,CrRAR,That’s good that's better
31-12-2020T12:19:11,CrRAR,Does the mug have green peppermint or red peppermints on it?
31-12-2020T12:19:34,SpazztasticKiwi,red
31-12-2020T12:19:58,CrRAR,nice
31-12-2020T12:21:29,CrRAR,"you got right up and out, I’m not going anywhere all day"

31-12-2020T12:46:07,CrRAR,Still feelin sleepily?

31-12-2020T12:51:23,SpazztasticKiwi,my eye should be better in a few days
31-12-2020T12:51:44,SpazztasticKiwi,but it’s probably a chemical burn
31-12-2020T12:52:31,CrRAR,how quickly did you do the wash?
31-12-2020T12:52:51,SpazztasticKiwi,it was in my eye maybe a minute
31-12-2020T12:53:16,SpazztasticKiwi,the only reason I knew it happened is I felt the splatter hit my contact over my eye
31-12-2020T12:53:27,SpazztasticKiwi,so my pupil never got hit
31-12-2020T12:53:45,CrRAR,"ah okay, long as it didn’t sit too long was it like an industrial degreaser or over the counter stuff?"
31-12-2020T12:54:12,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s the company stuff
31-12-2020T12:54:18,SpazztasticKiwi,non caustic it says
31-12-2020T12:54:40,CrRAR,"I feel like most degreaser is like high intensity soap, or maybe like pH basic it help break up grease."
31-12-2020T12:55:01,CrRAR,tho bleach is also pH basic but that’s to an extreme
31-12-2020T12:55:12,CrRAR,that’s good
31-12-2020T12:55:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I have eye insurance through work but since this happened on the clock I wonder
31-12-2020T12:56:11,SpazztasticKiwi,if this is a consern they’re gonna have a fit that it wasn’t reported
31-12-2020T12:56:49,CrRAR,oh no not OSHA
31-12-2020T12:56:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn’t see it worth making a report at the time but I did mention to my manager
31-12-2020T12:57:05,CrRAR,is it still irritated?
31-12-2020T12:57:32,CrRAR,probably worth a look at the safety/employee manual
31-12-2020T12:57:46,SpazztasticKiwi,the skin on the outside is dry & the eye itself where the chemical hit is definitely very red
31-12-2020T12:58:00,SpazztasticKiwi,but it doesn’t hurt to see or anything if that makes sense
31-12-2020T12:58:01,CrRAR,new policy: everyone wears protective eyewear at all times
31-12-2020T12:58:16,CrRAR,redness not good
31-12-2020T12:58:25,CrRAR,like bloodshot?
31-12-2020T12:58:40,SpazztasticKiwi,the problem is I didn’t feel it sting at all at first because the splatter hit my contact
31-12-2020T12:58:53,CrRAR,ah
31-12-2020T13:00:04,CrRAR,idk if it persists a eye doctor would be good opinion
31-12-2020T13:00:16,CrRAR,maybe do more eyewashes?
31-12-2020T13:00:45,CrRAR,sometimes specific things have certain care routines
31-12-2020T13:00:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I took rinse with me to work
31-12-2020T13:01:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m hunting my manager down again if I can real quick

31-12-2020T17:23:22,CrRAR,esp with toasted breads
31-12-2020T17:23:31,CrRAR,or just good bread in general
31-12-2020T17:23:48,SpazztasticKiwi,or one that you made fresh yourself with fresh tomatoes & lettuce
31-12-2020T17:24:29,CrRAR,if you add something sweet to it too it's very good
31-12-2020T17:24:46,CrRAR,like dried cranberries or apple slivers

31-12-2020T17:27:41,ZapiliDver,I want a normal winter!
31-12-2020T17:28:11,Ordithus,what is a normal winter for you?
31-12-2020T17:28:45,ZapiliDver,-20*C and snow
31-12-2020T17:28:53,ZapiliDver,Russia....
31-12-2020T17:29:01,ZapiliDver,Not +1 -1 and rain
31-12-2020T17:29:16,CrRAR,ah
31-12-2020T17:29:46,CrRAR,"yeah I feel the same, if it's cold it should be cold enough to just snow"
31-12-2020T17:29:57,ZapiliDver,yeah!
31-12-2020T17:30:02,Ordithus,"ah, I see! I'm used to cold and snow, too."
31-12-2020T17:30:05,CrRAR,none of the mixed crap haha
31-12-2020T17:30:34,CrRAR,I saw it was snowing it freaking Texas just a few days ago here in the US
31-12-2020T17:30:48,CrRAR,like all the way down to the Mexican border almost
31-12-2020T17:31:38,CrRAR,so when Texas is done with it you can probably have the snow back
31-12-2020T17:32:05,ZapiliDver,"Dear Texas, please give back winter to Russia =)"
31-12-2020T17:32:17,CrRAR,haha

31-12-2020T17:37:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I got the wraps filled on the floor & the breads done but the freezers are still on the fritz tho

31-12-2020T21:28:17,SageSaga,the problem is that we dont have the infrastructure for snow or ice storms- so when they happen we can lose power for over a week in many areas
31-12-2020T21:28:18,Ordithus,be careful what you wish for marv

31-12-2020T21:29:59,SageSaga,we cooked a giant pot of chicken and dumpling soup on it too- ate that for like the entire week
31-12-2020T21:30:01,BadFoMo,That sucks.
31-12-2020T21:30:06,SageSaga,had to go out and cut wood in the ice
31-12-2020T21:30:24,CrRAR,something tells me cold things do not cut so good
31-12-2020T21:30:29,Ordithus,would be a fun time if it wasn't for the freezing to death part

31-12-2020T21:37:32,Ordithus,power is pretty reliable where I am. takes 60+ mph wind storms to cause trouble
31-12-2020T21:38:48,CrRAR,cali is known for brownouts I think due to they try to estimate approximate max load at any thime and like an internet service only provide meager servers not capable of surge capacity

31-12-2020T22:31:54,ZRO4825,So...now to have to fight your previous characters in a future arc? :P
31-12-2020T22:32:03,TerraAegis8,That would be dope.
31-12-2020T22:32:05,Mihari,That would be suicide
31-12-2020T22:32:33,SageSaga,this was the second highest power level game they have had
31-12-2020T22:32:34,TerraAegis8,"It would be, unless you rise to that level with the next generation!"
31-12-2020T22:32:37,ZRO4825,lol
31-12-2020T22:32:57,ChromaticBard,What level did the campaign end at?
31-12-2020T22:33:16,SageSaga,23
31-12-2020T22:33:23,Twokinds,Second highest?
31-12-2020T22:33:28,ChromaticBard,huh
31-12-2020T22:33:30,Twokinds,Which one was higher? The meta game?
31-12-2020T22:33:44,SageSaga,yeah - the meta game was higher
31-12-2020T22:33:53,ChromaticBard,What edition?
31-12-2020T22:34:02,SageSaga,but i think your characters in this one were technically more powerful
31-12-2020T22:34:08,SageSaga,5th ed

31-12-2020T22:34:48,ChromaticBard,I'm interested in the level 23. Homebrew or some alternate rules I don't know about?
