04-02-2021T17:47:30,AspiringNoodle,You hear about those lawyers who go after companies who put out vanilla flavored products?
04-02-2021T18:02:14,CrRAR,"is that like the thing where like if it's not real maple syrup you can't call it ""maple""?"
04-02-2021T18:02:33,CrRAR,":deciduous_tree:*[well, I never!]"
04-02-2021T18:02:50,AspiringNoodle,"Basically, yeah."
04-02-2021T18:03:25,AspiringNoodle,"They go after products where the packaging implies that it was made with genuine vanilla, and not vanillin, and artificial substance that replicates the flavor and smell of vanilla."
04-02-2021T18:04:34,AspiringNoodle,Vanillin is the more commonly used of the two because 1: Vanilla is incredibly expensive and 2: Most people won't be able to tell the difference between the two.
04-02-2021T18:05:49,AspiringNoodle,"Also, random tangent: LOVE Canadian maple syrup."
04-02-2021T18:06:16,AspiringNoodle,"Something about the runnier nature of it, as well as the different flavor, just makes it soooooo gooooooood."

04-02-2021T20:31:21,AspiringNoodle,Slowly realizing that while some stores I may need to drive to might be a *smidge* farther away than I'd like
04-02-2021T20:31:39,AspiringNoodle,"May ultimately be worth it, especially if most deliveries will be in those areas ._."
04-02-2021T20:34:00,Ordithus,Have you ever played the railroad building game empire builder? It's a game about making a rail network to deliver goods to places for $$$
04-02-2021T20:34:07,Ordithus,Basically what you're doing
04-02-2021T20:34:48,Ordithus,it's a board game
04-02-2021T20:34:53,AspiringNoodle,Neato :O
04-02-2021T20:35:23,AspiringNoodle,One of the things that has me hesistating is that a lot of orders I've been offered on Instacart need me to drive 15 - 20 minutes away to reach the store.
04-02-2021T20:35:41,AspiringNoodle,But I question whether or not that's worth it for me if I can't get multiple deliveries in that area.
04-02-2021T20:37:45,AspiringNoodle,"(basically, I'm getting offers for stores nowhere close to home xD)"
04-02-2021T20:38:01,Ordithus,"well, either move closer"
04-02-2021T20:38:20,Ordithus,or know that people usually shop at the store closer to home when they can
04-02-2021T20:38:30,Ordithus,their home
