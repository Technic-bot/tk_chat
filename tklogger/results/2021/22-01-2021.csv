22-01-2021T01:25:18,BadFoMo,Flora: How about I rub your head? Sivil: That would be most undignifided for- (Flora rubs Sivil's head.) Sivil: That... That feels nice...
22-01-2021T01:25:46,Roughlandin,"Flora: ""High Five?"" *Bwom.*"
22-01-2021T01:25:46,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,has Sivil ever failed at his sworn duty?
22-01-2021T01:25:56,SageSaga,AI will eventually have more actual dragons though
22-01-2021T01:26:08,w0lfmare,But are they anthro
22-01-2021T01:26:15,TheSexyBeast,"Context time: in Wrinry and Sivil's world, nakedity is frowned upon?"
22-01-2021T01:26:30,SageSaga,at least one can shapeshift-
22-01-2021T01:26:33,Kameloh,"anthro, non anthro -- dragons are dragons :ckameloh-naokicat50:"
22-01-2021T01:26:44,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,at least human nakednness i......
22-01-2021T01:26:59,Ordithus,"presumably yes, since sivil is being clothing"
22-01-2021T01:27:09,Twokinds,"I mean, yeah, she comes from a city of dragons. They don't normally wear clothes."
22-01-2021T01:27:38,SageSaga,as a horrible book once told me many many times- people are naked under their clothes

22-01-2021T01:32:55,Roughlandin,1:30am... would that be dinner or breakfast?
22-01-2021T01:33:07,CrRAR,"He did eat prestream, but yes foods always good"

22-01-2021T01:35:29,CrRAR,:key:
22-01-2021T01:35:33,Roughlandin,Why does 4th meal always come with a vague feeling of shame?
22-01-2021T01:36:09,InTheLionsDen,Not if you're a Hobbit.
22-01-2021T01:36:46,Roughlandin,Yeah but hobbit 4th meal is like around midday

22-01-2021T01:47:12,SageSaga,they arent generally
22-01-2021T01:47:47,CrRAR,Unbridled autonomy~
22-01-2021T01:47:57,SageSaga,usually its like- you already did whatever was asked of your and now you have the power for good
22-01-2021T01:48:03,SageSaga,(or evil ho ho ho)
22-01-2021T01:48:13,JKDrake07,Eyy
22-01-2021T01:48:20,CrRAR,ello
22-01-2021T01:48:28,Werewing,Why not just make Tom an Arcane Trickster. Then he gets magic and gets to sit on the side.
22-01-2021T01:48:44,JKDrake07,I see cuteness here
22-01-2021T01:48:51,SageSaga,Tom- a rogue? hmmm
22-01-2021T01:49:15,0crop,Hey JKDrake

22-01-2021T01:49:54,ChromaticBard,bleh making typing mistakes today. Didn't mean a question mark there
22-01-2021T01:51:38,SageSaga,im trying to help him be lazy but Tom doesn't trust my judgement on D&D for some reason...
22-01-2021T01:51:46,ChromaticBard,lol
22-01-2021T01:52:08,unsteddyphoenix,Tom *war flashbacks*
22-01-2021T01:53:00,SageSaga,i dont think its fair to think of any of my campaigns as ptsd inducing
22-01-2021T01:53:03,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,what would be the worst class and race for Tom?
22-01-2021T01:53:10,SageSaga,i run fun games
22-01-2021T01:53:15,SageSaga,not stressful games
22-01-2021T01:53:25,unsteddyphoenix,You may be slightly biased

22-01-2021T01:55:09,Twokinds,Living forever is certainly prefereable to not living forever.
22-01-2021T01:55:21,Twokinds,Plus no sleep
22-01-2021T01:55:28,Zakuru,Tom...
22-01-2021T01:55:33,unsteddyphoenix,druids have an extended lifespan too
22-01-2021T01:55:34,ChromaticBard,Yeah. 4 hour long rests is pretty great
22-01-2021T01:55:36,unsteddyphoenix,Sooo~
22-01-2021T01:55:47,Werewing,If you want to just live really long Druid Elf would probably outlive some worlds in DnD.
22-01-2021T01:55:49,SageSaga,Druids dont have an extended lifespan
22-01-2021T01:55:52,Ordithus,so not a goblin
22-01-2021T01:55:54,ChromaticBard,Druid Elf. You can never die from age
22-01-2021T01:56:06,ChromaticBard,Druids age at a 10th the normal rate or something I think
22-01-2021T01:56:10,SageSaga,druids still die from old age
22-01-2021T01:56:14,Werewing,"Isn't that a late level thing, Sage? I could have sworn I read that somewhere."
22-01-2021T01:56:23,unsteddyphoenix,"""Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year."""
22-01-2021T01:56:28,Werewing,"Yeah, but it is still a looong time."
22-01-2021T01:56:32,ChromaticBard,"Yep, as I thought"
22-01-2021T01:56:44,SageSaga,yeah you still die
22-01-2021T01:56:58,unsteddyphoenix,Sorry what did I say? Infinite lifespan? Hmm lets scroll up
22-01-2021T01:57:00,SageSaga,also the longer you live the more likely you are to be killed :P
22-01-2021T01:57:09,unsteddyphoenix,Nnno it seems to say EXTENDED lifespan
22-01-2021T01:57:11,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,what about Warforged?
22-01-2021T01:57:19,Ordithus,haha yes I will live hundreds of years! *crushed by boulder*
22-01-2021T01:57:21,Zakuru,that's a... sad way to view it sage XD
22-01-2021T01:57:22,unsteddyphoenix,Huh. Interesting.
22-01-2021T01:57:25,Werewing,I suppose alternatively you could make a special pact or a high level spell like True Polymorph or Wish.
22-01-2021T01:57:29,ChromaticBard,But be an elf. Then you can become up to 7500 years old
22-01-2021T01:57:42,SageSaga,Warforged have an unknown lifespan
22-01-2021T01:58:08,SageSaga,because the oldest of warforged are like- 30
22-01-2021T01:58:23,InTheLionsDen,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
22-01-2021T01:58:30,Werewing,I think it is a Theseus' ship type thing.

22-01-2021T02:02:58,unsteddyphoenix,What about leveling to get the clone spell
22-01-2021T02:03:07,unsteddyphoenix,I thought that was your dream. Having many Toms to work on stuff
22-01-2021T02:03:38,ChromaticBard,"My party has already become rich. They got 7.5k platinum from pulling a scam at an auction house with a warlock's pact of the blade weapon, which is a Very Rare magic weapon"
22-01-2021T02:04:10,SageSaga,that's not rare-
22-01-2021T02:04:17,ChromaticBard,"The odds for the scam succeeding was way against their favor, but they pulled it off so I let it happen"
22-01-2021T02:04:22,ChromaticBard,They are barely level 7
22-01-2021T02:04:28,SageSaga,you can get it at level 3
22-01-2021T02:04:34,unsteddyphoenix,It couldve been a rare weapon that the warlock pacted
22-01-2021T02:04:50,unsteddyphoenix,You gotta kill them for that one
22-01-2021T02:05:00,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-Emberflail: we need moar wrinry
22-01-2021T02:05:03,Twokinds,yeah clones
22-01-2021T02:05:27,SageSaga,Clones and Simulacrums
22-01-2021T02:05:38,Twokinds,"I want many Toms, all sharing the same conciousness. So I can go out with no risk."
22-01-2021T02:06:06,w0lfmare,A Tom? Wanting to go outside?
22-01-2021T02:06:07,unsteddyphoenix,More Sahari and Yena~
22-01-2021T02:06:07,SageSaga,that only sorta exists- im sure we could develop something like that though
22-01-2021T02:06:12,w0lfmare,What is this
22-01-2021T02:06:18,ChromaticBard,lol
22-01-2021T02:06:25,Ordithus,"also yes, teddy"
22-01-2021T02:06:28,Twokinds,"If I'm killed in the wilds from some freak accident, well... I'm also still at home, so no biggy."
22-01-2021T02:06:56,unsteddyphoenix,"dominate person, take over their body, adventure as them"
22-01-2021T02:08:04,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,or take something from Cyberpunk 2077
22-01-2021T02:08:23,Twokinds,Yeah that's not horrifying or anything
22-01-2021T02:08:30,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,become and engram
22-01-2021T02:08:50,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,and just download yourself into a new body when ya die
22-01-2021T02:09:22,InTheLionsDen,Keep your re-life insurance paid up
22-01-2021T02:10:03,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,you could always become a vampire
22-01-2021T02:10:40,Werewing,Or a ghost. Just come back and haunt the world.
22-01-2021T02:10:42,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,sorry Tom  but you will have to be a Twilight Vampire!!!
22-01-2021T02:11:14,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:

22-01-2021T02:15:22,unsteddyphoenix,free sarah! two for the price of one!
22-01-2021T02:15:47,SageSaga,not sure how that space got in that nobody
22-01-2021T02:15:48,Werewing,"Free Sarah, unleash the smol dragon."
22-01-2021T02:15:55,Ordithus,but then he has to worship some god
22-01-2021T02:16:10,swack24,should sh have furry scales
22-01-2021T02:16:29,Werewing,Just worship the couch god.
22-01-2021T02:17:07,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Can Dnd Tom worship real life Tom?
22-01-2021T02:17:16,Twokinds,Well the D&D world is an awful place were you have to worship someone or your soul is damned.
22-01-2021T02:17:41,Werewing,I think that is just Forgotten Realms.
22-01-2021T02:18:01,Werewing,"If the world is homebrew or somewhere with a more forgiving death god, maybe not."
22-01-2021T02:18:23,SageSaga,ehh i was partly wrong about that actually
22-01-2021T02:18:51,SageSaga,its people who deny the existence and work against the gods that are sent to the 9th level of hell
22-01-2021T02:19:25,SageSaga,decent and or good people that didnt worship anyone in particular get picked up based on their deeds and deposited in an afterlife
22-01-2021T02:20:09,SageSaga,or fade into the purgatory realm
22-01-2021T02:20:49,SageSaga,besides- worship of some gods is preeetty easy- they have some pretty basic stuff that if you just do- you're good
22-01-2021T02:21:01,SageSaga,and you can change gods whenever
22-01-2021T02:21:27,Twokinds,Yeah well I don't like the idea of being beholden to any being.
22-01-2021T02:21:46,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,what if there was a god of godlessness?
22-01-2021T02:21:49,Twokinds,There's no freedom.
22-01-2021T02:22:34,unsteddyphoenix,Just become a god yourself
22-01-2021T02:22:37,InTheLionsDen,Worship yourself
22-01-2021T02:22:42,Twokinds,I would if I could!
22-01-2021T02:22:44,likeafox,just never die
22-01-2021T02:22:59,SageSaga,pretty sure if you break things down enough you'll find there's never any freedom anywhere
22-01-2021T02:23:16,ChromaticBard,"Just find a group of Kuo-toa and trick them into worshiping you. Boom, easy godhood!"
22-01-2021T02:23:37,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,just have your dnd character worship in real life Tom
22-01-2021T02:23:41,ChromaticBard,lol

22-01-2021T02:26:30,SageSaga,Sune just wants to spread love and beauty to the world- so if you just make art- you are serving the will of Sune
22-01-2021T02:27:23,SageSaga,heck - seeking out freedom and living by that- that's worship of Mielikki XD
22-01-2021T02:27:30,ChromaticBard,lol
22-01-2021T02:27:42,Twokinds,I'd rather just destroy my soul once I'm done.
22-01-2021T02:28:01,SageSaga,thats Demon Prince territory
22-01-2021T02:28:32,ChromaticBard,"My favorite character, my tabaxi bard Titania, is all about performing. It is her favorite thing to do, and one of the few things that makes her happy. So, whichever gods like art & music would like her"

22-01-2021T02:31:45,SageSaga,depends on what you want
22-01-2021T02:32:09,SageSaga,Elves have a good reincarnation package
22-01-2021T02:32:57,SageSaga,"Sune has a good retirement if you love music, art and sex"

22-01-2021T12:55:56,SpazztasticKiwi,there was no diamond
22-01-2021T12:56:03,SpazztasticKiwi,it was a plain engraved band
22-01-2021T12:56:19,Roughlandin,Ooh. Understated. I like!
22-01-2021T12:57:19,SpazztasticKiwi,black matte but two blue lines & his name was in script in blue in the middle

22-01-2021T15:34:55,BadFoMo,Yo.
22-01-2021T15:34:58,Hogan,Hi Ordithus! :-)
22-01-2021T15:38:04,SageSaga,work is piling up again- and its not the fun work - gotta do my taxes which is a real pain for me- wonder if i should pay someone to do them for me-
22-01-2021T15:39:10,Hogan,"Ay, taxes... the ultimate no-fun work..."
22-01-2021T15:39:26,Ordithus,especially for the self employed with weird income
22-01-2021T15:40:03,SageSaga,taxes should totally be a mandatory class in high school if we arent going to just let the government bill people for their taxes
22-01-2021T15:40:14,Hogan,"Ay, on my end I only have to update a few numbers digitally, then done's done..."
22-01-2021T15:40:41,CrRAR,like a lot of laws so much of the tax profession is subjective
22-01-2021T15:40:51,CrRAR,it's silly
22-01-2021T15:41:20,Ordithus,my dad was a cpa once upon a time so does mine. I should do it myself sometime...
22-01-2021T15:41:21,SageSaga,"i need to find all my book sales over the course of the year, get my patreon stuff set- find out how much i spent on books and art, and add that to my deductions and then i gotta figure out all the commissions i did -"
22-01-2021T15:41:44,SpazztasticKiwi,is there something I missed
22-01-2021T15:41:54,SpazztasticKiwi,folks are selling prom dresses like crazy
22-01-2021T15:41:55,CrRAR,typically tax people know the hard rules and then know what rules can be bent or things you can qualify for
22-01-2021T15:42:11,Twokinds,Fun times
22-01-2021T15:42:16,SageSaga,the question is - what is cheaper-
22-01-2021T15:42:37,Hogan,Selfemployed cartoonists is really getting the heavy end of the stick in the tax-department :-|
22-01-2021T15:42:45,SageSaga,can i hire someone to do my taxes cheaper than i can file on my own for my small small smol business?
22-01-2021T15:42:53,CrRAR,"well, paying someone is a fee, but feeling it's done RIGHT is a good feeling too"
22-01-2021T15:43:11,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-adiracoin: I bet a few comms would pay for a pro pretty quick
22-01-2021T15:43:22,SageSaga,its gonna cost me like 240USD just to file taxes online through like turbo tax or H&R
22-01-2021T15:43:46,sunblaze,ouch :(
22-01-2021T15:44:06,CrRAR,"I guess it just comes down to if you find someone that gets a better result than doing it yourself, everything else equal, doing yourself isn't bad at all"
22-01-2021T15:44:16,sunblaze,I am using pros for years and never got that expensive
22-01-2021T15:44:34,SageSaga,doing it myself takes a bunch of my time -that i could be using drawing more boobs
22-01-2021T15:44:45,sunblaze,^ :ptv-hearts:
22-01-2021T15:45:01,CrRAR,"yeah, sometimes independent cpas with their own practice can have better pricing"
22-01-2021T15:45:17,SageSaga,besides - if i can get someone to do it for me for 200 dollars - thats saving me 40 dollars-
22-01-2021T15:45:17,CrRAR,"but you gotta find a good one, like finding a doctor kinda"
22-01-2021T15:45:28,CrRAR,yeah
22-01-2021T15:46:30,Hogan,"Yeah, I had a subcontractor who paid someone to do his stuff... forgot a who bunch of stuff, including turning it in, so he almost had to close his business..."
22-01-2021T15:46:50,CrRAR,oh no
22-01-2021T15:47:05,Ordithus,"in those cases, at least in the US, the hired person is liable \o/"
22-01-2021T15:47:08,Hogan,"So yeah, you need to find a good one..."
22-01-2021T15:47:13,CrRAR,yup
22-01-2021T15:47:55,Hogan,"To some degree I think its liable too here, haven't looked into it though"
22-01-2021T15:48:45,CrRAR,"yeah a licensed preparer goes on the returns as liable, like in event of audit if something doesn't add up"
22-01-2021T15:49:15,CrRAR,or just sloppy preparering
22-01-2021T15:49:52,Hogan,Sage's Stream: One of the few places where boobs and tax-discussion goes hand in hand XD
22-01-2021T15:50:09,CrRAR,"so, essentially, they're vouching with their own reputation"

22-01-2021T17:43:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll eat a whole can plain
22-01-2021T17:43:38,CrRAR,Kinda like tasteless pickles
22-01-2021T17:43:48,CrRAR,can’t stop
22-01-2021T17:43:53,SpazztasticKiwi,and mushrooms
22-01-2021T17:44:51,CrRAR,The ‘pennsylvania dutchman’ ones in the can are pretty good
22-01-2021T17:45:07,CrRAR,never ate them just plain though
22-01-2021T17:45:20,CrRAR,like those?

22-01-2021T17:50:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not a big sausage person
22-01-2021T17:50:22,CrRAR,What about yellow peps?
22-01-2021T17:50:31,SpazztasticKiwi,they’re ok
22-01-2021T17:51:16,SpazztasticKiwi,thing with sausage is they’re either greasy or they put tons of pepper or spice & there’s no flavor
22-01-2021T17:51:33,CrRAR,"Yeah, hot dogs and sausages are rare things, I just don’t like the composition/ingredients"
22-01-2021T17:51:55,CrRAR,Like reason it’s a sausage is pretty much cuz it’s more fat than meats
22-01-2021T17:52:07,CrRAR,egh
22-01-2021T17:52:24,SpazztasticKiwi,fat in meat is a balance
22-01-2021T17:52:37,CrRAR,It gives flavor
22-01-2021T17:52:48,CrRAR,yeah all need some
22-01-2021T17:53:40,CrRAR,but I wouldn’t be surprised if sausage is like 60/40 or more fat/meat.
22-01-2021T17:55:42,CrRAR,but they can be so good with fried peppers and onions
22-01-2021T17:55:59,SpazztasticKiwi,ew onions
22-01-2021T17:56:06,CrRAR,some chicken sausage can be decently similar in taste
22-01-2021T17:56:14,CrRAR,Not even like carmalized?
22-01-2021T17:56:45,SpazztasticKiwi,caramelized & grilled are the only onions I like
22-01-2021T17:56:53,SpazztasticKiwi,& I won’t eat them alone
22-01-2021T17:58:02,CrRAR,Yeah fresh onions don’t really belong anywhere on a plate
22-01-2021T17:58:08,CrRAR,That’s not food
22-01-2021T17:58:15,CrRAR,that’s a mistake
22-01-2021T17:59:04,CrRAR,Like the fact they end up in some salad is kinda sketchy
22-01-2021T17:59:36,CrRAR,"get them away, and then the red ones thinking they’re sneaky"
22-01-2021T17:59:45,CrRAR,nope
22-01-2021T17:59:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw Mark take a bite straight  out an onion
22-01-2021T18:00:05,SpazztasticKiwi,bit the thing like an apple
22-01-2021T18:00:12,CrRAR,oh yeah
22-01-2021T18:00:19,CrRAR,unpleasant
22-01-2021T18:00:40,CrRAR,Wasn’t that step 1 of the farewell unnus annus dinner?
22-01-2021T18:00:54,SpazztasticKiwi,no it was the eating onions for 24 hours
22-01-2021T18:01:04,CrRAR,Oh
22-01-2021T18:01:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"while cooking some, he picked one up & just"

22-01-2021T18:01:44,SpazztasticKiwi,like an apple
22-01-2021T18:01:54,CrRAR,Wait is that why him and Ethan each got an onion though then at the dinner?
22-01-2021T18:02:03,CrRAR,Like as a callback to that?
22-01-2021T18:02:13,CrRAR,or was that just not UA?
22-01-2021T18:02:30,SpazztasticKiwi,it was unus annus
22-01-2021T18:02:38,SpazztasticKiwi,they did a few videos with onions
22-01-2021T18:02:38,CrRAR,ah ok
22-01-2021T18:03:00,SpazztasticKiwi,there was onions at the final dinner too
22-01-2021T18:03:17,CrRAR,Onions the most shocking easily accessible food item available in mass quantities

22-01-2021T18:06:11,SpazztasticKiwi,the worst is the taste

22-01-2021T18:08:18,CrRAR,pretty sure the onion is flavored like that to probably deter animals from doing that xD
