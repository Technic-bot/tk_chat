30-01-2021T00:32:41,SonOfGoku,Night Ord
30-01-2021T00:53:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to know why john rolfe is given a horse that spooks from some commotion under its feet
30-01-2021T00:53:45,SpazztasticKiwi,is he not a commander of some sort
30-01-2021T00:54:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"he‚Äôs obviously got a heavy reputation & they don‚Äôt battle break all their horses, even one they‚Äôre giving him to ride?"
30-01-2021T01:14:12,CrRAR,spoiled looking show horse?
30-01-2021T01:14:36,CrRAR,or did actually look combat-ready?
30-01-2021T01:15:28,CrRAR,Horses natually are some of the most skittish of animals
30-01-2021T01:15:54,SpazztasticKiwi,did you not say you watched pocahontas 2
30-01-2021T01:16:14,CrRAR,It would be funny if it was a plot point that Pocahontas fared better with that horse becuse of her nature-abilities
30-01-2021T01:16:18,CrRAR,No not yet
30-01-2021T01:16:31,SpazztasticKiwi,rolfe comes off the ship on a horse & it spooks when the raccoon & dog run under it
30-01-2021T01:16:46,CrRAR,ah
30-01-2021T01:17:09,CrRAR,Glad to know Meeko‚Äôs up to his old tricks lol
30-01-2021T01:17:41,SpazztasticKiwi,rolfe is obviously decorated with high honors & if that‚Äôs not his horse - which he should have one of his own if not several if he‚Äôs so important - they give him a horse that easily spooks?
30-01-2021T01:18:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"also, this girl is from another continent & culture and she gets 2 guys"
30-01-2021T01:18:25,SpazztasticKiwi,TWO
30-01-2021T01:19:26,SpazztasticKiwi,AND

30-01-2021T01:25:07,SpazztasticKiwi,the movie is in spitting distance of my age
30-01-2021T01:25:16,SpazztasticKiwi,so you get potato trees
30-01-2021T01:40:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I call bs on river water taking any kind of makeup on

30-01-2021T02:03:18,SpazztasticKiwi,there‚Äôs no jokes & that‚Äôs unfortunately funny
30-01-2021T02:17:44,CrRAR,ingenious and yet how cruel nature is
30-01-2021T02:18:40,CrRAR,so snarcastic
30-01-2021T02:21:59,CrRAR,There was a video of birds I remember just stepping into an updraft or something and just opening their wings to fly as they felt enough wind instinctively
30-01-2021T02:22:23,CrRAR,Fat pideon: ‚Äúnot enough wind‚Äù
30-01-2021T02:22:44,CrRAR,"‚ÄúDefinitely, not enough‚Äù"
30-01-2021T02:24:00,CrRAR,The updraft birds you kinda got these sense that like how dogs held over water just kinda start paddling reflectively
30-01-2021T02:24:39,CrRAR,Tthe birds kinda register ‚Äúoh! wind = wings out!‚Äù

30-01-2021T16:26:40,BlueStreak98,Wholesome is nice from time to time.
30-01-2021T16:26:41,Twokinds,Well I don't want only wholesome.
30-01-2021T16:26:44,Twokinds,Then there's no variety.

30-01-2021T16:30:47,Roughlandin,A $200 tier Tom used to have and might offer again
30-01-2021T16:31:12,Dadrobit,"Tom had the idea a while back to do a massive omni-poll for an entire year's worth of sketches to do a second chance color, but I don't think it ever materialized."
30-01-2021T16:31:14,unsteddyphoenix,you bribe nora and she forces tom to colour an older sketch
30-01-2021T16:31:18,CrimsonQuill,"The ""used to have"" is because there is a bit of a backlog, and poor Tom has an awful lot on his plate."
30-01-2021T16:31:23,Ordithus,"holder of the card could pick one sketch, from any time or anywhere (like con sketches) and Tom would color it"
30-01-2021T16:31:39,Ordithus,he always goes way overboard with them and make them some of the best stuff he does
30-01-2021T16:31:48,Roughlandin,Nora shall reach back through the mists of time to grab any sketch the holder so chooses!
30-01-2021T16:31:54,CrimsonQuill,It's become very busy for him (probably because of the Vol. 5 prep and the comic pages)

30-01-2021T16:32:37,Roughlandin,Hydration is also important

30-01-2021T16:32:52,ZapiliDver,Hi partizzan
30-01-2021T16:34:09,Sammit,Hi Partizzan
30-01-2021T16:34:16,ChromaticBard,Hi Partizzan!
30-01-2021T16:34:38,Roughlandin,"Trace caught a tiger by the tail. She didn't holler, so now they're here."
30-01-2021T16:34:41,Skornos,Sounds pretty great! But even if they would still be available... There's no way I could afford them. At least not momentarily. Maybe one day-and I'm pretty certain it would be a one time only thing.
30-01-2021T16:35:19,Roughlandin,Yeah. The price point is kinda designed so Tom doesn't get flooded with more Nora Cards than he can handle
30-01-2021T16:35:41,Skornos,"May I ask, how did it happen that they aren't getting offered at all anymore? Did so many people got one despite the height?"
30-01-2021T16:35:51,TheSexyBeast,Raise the price maybe?
30-01-2021T16:35:55,Ordithus,Fell behind on them
30-01-2021T16:36:07,Rainelover,I wonder what an older flora would look like?
30-01-2021T16:36:17,Ordithus,They were limited to a max of 4 a month when that tier existed
30-01-2021T16:36:18,Roughlandin,And he felt it wasn't fair to keep taking money for the tier if he couldn't keep up with tht workload
30-01-2021T16:37:17,unsteddyphoenix,Plus people kept being cheeky and asking a lot from them~
30-01-2021T16:37:37,Skornos,"Ah, I see. And raising it even more just would had made it pretty much unreachable for the very most."
30-01-2021T16:37:38,Roughlandin,Picky folk
30-01-2021T16:37:55,BlueStreak98,fickle folk
30-01-2021T16:38:01,unsteddyphoenix,nah if he raisedi t more it probably still wouldve sold out
30-01-2021T16:38:06,Ordithus,yeah
30-01-2021T16:38:11,InTheLionsDen,"Also, the ones in at that tier didn't change often, giving others a chance."
30-01-2021T16:38:15,Roughlandin,(It's worth it)
30-01-2021T16:38:16,unsteddyphoenix,he just didnt feel comfortble making itmore expensive
30-01-2021T16:38:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean I can easily spend $100 for a really good personal color
30-01-2021T16:38:35,Ordithus,"even though it's limited to sketches Tom has already made, $200 was really a steal for the quality"
30-01-2021T16:38:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt know which sketch I‚Äôd pick for $200
30-01-2021T16:38:49,ZapiliDver,"Hehe, some art creators can price up 1k$ for a char =)"
30-01-2021T16:38:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I like too many
30-01-2021T16:39:13,Roughlandin,It was pretty cheap for what basically amounted to comission work
30-01-2021T16:39:16,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rose: if I ever get the chance - Rose in the hay
30-01-2021T16:39:23,CrimsonQuill,...I may have spent that much money on a commission in December....

30-01-2021T16:40:57,Skornos,"Yeah, but 200 is something one usually can get-if one REALLY wants, but more..."

30-01-2021T16:41:57,CrimsonQuill,That is true
30-01-2021T16:41:59,Roughlandin,Sing Rawring Reni is another one worth Nora Carding

30-01-2021T16:43:09,ZapiliDver,Just do it =)
30-01-2021T16:43:13,Skornos,It's not about that there would be no one to pay it anymore-it would be just not affordable at all for those wjo are NOT rich.
30-01-2021T16:43:19,Dadrobit,Back.
30-01-2021T16:43:22,ZapiliDver,wb

30-01-2021T16:43:57,SpazztasticKiwi,do you think there‚Äôd be trouble if tom did a Adelaide ‚Äújust do it‚Äù ad
30-01-2021T16:43:58,unsteddyphoenix,"its only 4 slots though, if he made it cheaper itd bea scramble and youd probably not get it anyway"

30-01-2021T16:44:16,SpazztasticKiwi,don‚Äôt lewd me
30-01-2021T16:44:21,Ordithus,nice gamma
30-01-2021T16:44:37,unsteddyphoenix,nice!
30-01-2021T16:44:39,Dadrobit,"Yeah, raising the price wouldn't have done anything to stem the buying. There was a handfull of people already that were just putting down the $200 month agter month already. That kinda money probably could've absorbed whatever Tom raised it by and it"
30-01-2021T16:44:44,Dadrobit,woulda just limited other folks
30-01-2021T16:45:00,ZapiliDver,"Cool lewd work, Gamma"
30-01-2021T16:45:02,Skornos,Didn't talked about making it cheaper-talked about making it NOT higher.
30-01-2021T16:45:03,Dadrobit,after*
30-01-2021T16:45:37,GammaEradon,"What can I say, I love blushy Reni"
30-01-2021T16:45:41,Skornos,Guess the only solution would have been a cooldown.
30-01-2021T16:45:42,Dadrobit,TSB mentioned making it higher
30-01-2021T16:45:47,Ordithus,I think the intent of the price was that people wouldn't just hang onto it
30-01-2021T16:45:55,ZapiliDver,I think even if Tom set up price to 500$ all slots will be selled in minutes
30-01-2021T16:46:02,unsteddyphoenix,which...didnt work out haha
30-01-2021T16:46:14,Ordithus,"alas. but we did get some amazing art, still!"
30-01-2021T16:46:17,Roughlandin,Dragons like hoarding things
30-01-2021T16:46:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I would think to do something like a raffle
30-01-2021T16:46:34,Skornos,Exactly... But not to any normal person. Only to the rich guys.
30-01-2021T16:46:37,unsteddyphoenix,yeah! :D
30-01-2021T16:46:53,unsteddyphoenix,shouldve just eaten the rich
30-01-2021T16:46:53,Ordithus,"considering it was all Tom's art, not like it was a loss to never get one. was bonus color <3"
30-01-2021T16:47:01,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I 100% regret not putting down the money to get one done. Feelsbadman."
30-01-2021T16:47:03,SpazztasticKiwi,you pay a $100 or something for a spot & if you get picked you get a sketch colored that week
30-01-2021T16:47:08,Skornos,That's why cooldown.
30-01-2021T16:47:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"if not, it‚Äôs a $100 tip to Tom"
30-01-2021T16:47:20,JKDrake07,Hellooo
30-01-2021T16:47:33,AvisIgnis,eeeeeeehh
30-01-2021T16:47:34,ZapiliDver,"Kiwi, patreon hates raffle. Gambling is prohibited"
30-01-2021T16:47:46,Roughlandin,Hi JKD
30-01-2021T16:47:49,SpazztasticKiwi,well yea
30-01-2021T16:47:49,Dadrobit,If they ever come back I'll be hot on that for sure tho
30-01-2021T16:47:55,AvisIgnis,"yeah, payment would have to be *after* the drawing"
30-01-2021T16:48:02,Ordithus,though we get 5 of the monthly sketches colored more often nowadays
30-01-2021T16:48:16,Ordithus,"you and 100 other people, dad!"
30-01-2021T16:48:18,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs not a legit suggestion
30-01-2021T16:48:27,SpazztasticKiwi,there‚Äôs too much wrong with it
30-01-2021T16:49:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"like, how many people would have a FIT they didn‚Äôt win even when knowing it was random & there‚Äôs other participants"
30-01-2021T16:49:23,Dadrobit,"Yeah, or at least the half a dozen rotating donors from the first round."
30-01-2021T16:49:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I wasn‚Äôt serious
30-01-2021T16:49:41,Roughlandin,I like the idea of one special stream a year where all the uncolored sketches get another chance... but that is a LOT of sketches
30-01-2021T16:49:55,Skornos,"Someone called this a Commission, but it isn't right? Yeah couldn't just ask for anything, it had to be an already existing sketch, right?"
30-01-2021T16:50:00,Ordithus,if you think the monthly vote is hard
30-01-2021T16:50:12,Ordithus,"yeah, it has to already exist"
30-01-2021T16:50:48,Roughlandin,It's a pre-existing sketch but Tom gave the Card holder a lot of input about how it was colored. I think he even tweaked some of the original sketches at the holder's request
30-01-2021T16:51:04,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs like proposing you collect all the folks who want a Nora cards‚Äô ideas for what they want colored & run a raffle on that
30-01-2021T16:51:12,Skornos,I see.
30-01-2021T16:51:15,SpazztasticKiwi,equally as nightmarish
30-01-2021T16:51:43,Ordithus,a return of nora cards in any form supposes Tom's got the spare time for em
30-01-2021T16:51:50,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, when I mentioned commission I didn't mean one of Tom's things, it was another artist"
30-01-2021T16:51:57,CrimsonQuill,Sorry

30-01-2021T16:52:51,Dadrobit,Maybe after the next book print??? A guy can dream.
30-01-2021T16:53:35,Roughlandin,"Hmm... what about using some kind of RNG to pull up like 10 uncolored sketches, and then having a vote on those?"
30-01-2021T16:53:59,Skornos,What's an RNG?
30-01-2021T16:54:06,Roughlandin,Random number generator
30-01-2021T16:54:07,ZapiliDver,Random Number Generator
30-01-2021T16:54:12,Skornos,Ah
30-01-2021T16:54:18,LunarSchnitzel,Pray to RNGesus that your favorite sketch is in the pool
30-01-2021T16:54:21,Ordithus,could limit it to runner-ups only
30-01-2021T16:54:29,Roughlandin,I like that
30-01-2021T16:54:31,ZapiliDver,good idea
30-01-2021T16:54:59,Skornos,Wgat are runner ups?
30-01-2021T16:55:03,ZapiliDver,5x12=60 is affordable number
30-01-2021T16:55:11,CrRAR,the top votes below color winners
30-01-2021T16:55:17,ZapiliDver,"Runner ups - 5 scetches, that came close to win"
30-01-2021T16:55:37,Roughlandin,Monthly places 6-10

30-01-2021T17:50:17,Roughlandin,Tis :D
30-01-2021T17:50:40,Skornos,"No drinking from the tap. Just wetting the whole room with it, while miracolously staying completely dry oneself."
30-01-2021T17:51:01,CrRAR,sounds like waterbending abilities
30-01-2021T17:51:43,Skornos,It isn't. I've seen it.
30-01-2021T17:51:51,CrRAR,haha
30-01-2021T17:52:11,Skornos,They somehow just use their forepaws.
30-01-2021T17:53:45,Roughlandin,Now that's what I call wood planks
30-01-2021T17:54:39,Skornos,And afterwards tgey run away without leaving more than one or two pawprints... As if they had gotten just so little on them that it takes only moments to dry...
30-01-2021T17:56:01,Roughlandin,Here comes the sun! Doo-da-doo-doo!
30-01-2021T17:58:16,BlueStreak98,This makes me miss summer.

30-01-2021T17:58:40,BlueStreak98,And being less than 6 feet from other people
30-01-2021T17:58:48,Ordithus,"ah yes, spring, the less snow and less cold"
30-01-2021T17:59:09,Roughlandin,At least there's more than 4 hours of daylight lol
30-01-2021T17:59:20,Ordithus,and that
30-01-2021T18:00:45,Roughlandin,"Ope. Brb, gotta go help with dinner!"

30-01-2021T18:06:01,Skornos,Same question here!
30-01-2021T18:06:07,BlueStreak98,Hey heresy
30-01-2021T18:07:04,Skornos,"Why ""oops""?"
30-01-2021T18:07:18,Ordithus,don't worry bout it
30-01-2021T18:07:32,BadFoMo,I'm thinking wrong chat.
30-01-2021T18:07:55,CrRAR,:saxophone::chipmunk:
30-01-2021T18:08:01,Skornos,Not worrying... Yet. So far only curious.

30-01-2021T18:08:15,MoonDance,This seems to be a perfect picture for today. It's raining rn where I live
30-01-2021T18:08:21,Rainelover,Maybe accidental spoiler?
30-01-2021T18:08:23,Twokinds,"Someone mentioned skunk keidran earlier, and I was responding to them but didn't hit enter."
30-01-2021T18:08:34,BadFoMo,Ah.
30-01-2021T18:08:37,BadFoMo,Thanks.
30-01-2021T18:08:38,MoonDance,darn
30-01-2021T18:08:39,Ordithus,that was a while ago
30-01-2021T18:08:48,Twokinds,"There can't be skunk keidran, cause keidran are only feline and canine-like. keidran doesn't mean 'furry'."
30-01-2021T18:09:00,Ordithus,skunks are rather cat-like
30-01-2021T18:09:17,MoonDance,Skunks are Mephitidae
30-01-2021T18:09:34,Skornos,Wasn't there an squirrel keidran nibbly suggestion?
30-01-2021T18:09:43,Katfeathers,So Skunk and Badger folk would be something else then
30-01-2021T18:09:43,Twokinds,I guess a feline could have skunk-like fur pattern.
30-01-2021T18:09:45,hyneria,that is not canon I think
30-01-2021T18:09:52,hyneria,keidran Nibbly
30-01-2021T18:10:04,Zakuru,Like that cat from Looney Tunes
30-01-2021T18:10:10,Ordithus,was just thinking that zak
30-01-2021T18:10:13,Skornos,With her Pet Wolf!
30-01-2021T18:10:13,BlueStreak98,Would a feline keidran with a skunklike fur pattern get chased by an actual skunk?
30-01-2021T18:10:16,BadFoMo,...So there /could/ be Skunk anthros in TwoKinds but they aren't Keidran?
30-01-2021T18:10:17,ProsePro7,They can only be Feline or Canine so no mer people or lizardos I guess
30-01-2021T18:10:23,hyneria,The lizards are not keidran either I think?
30-01-2021T18:10:43,hyneria,there are lizardmen types in TK}
30-01-2021T18:10:45,Ordithus,Basitins are also not Keidran :ctwokinds-keith8D:
30-01-2021T18:10:47,Ordithus,I'm helping!
30-01-2021T18:10:48,BlueStreak98,I hadn't suggested a skunk keidran so much as I'd just suggested a skunk. Not sure if I was the one being referred to there or not.
30-01-2021T18:10:53,ProsePro7,But I guess Tom is saying that Penelope Pussy cat could be a Keidran but not Pepe Le Pew
30-01-2021T18:11:16,Skornos,I think I read somewhere that merfolk exist... But there are obviously an species of there own.
30-01-2021T18:11:17,Katfeathers,Eyep
30-01-2021T18:11:29,CrRAR,"Skunks, bah! Skinks better."
30-01-2021T18:11:53,BlueStreak98,"Skinks, Skanks, Skonks..."
30-01-2021T18:12:00,hyneria,"seeing the art Tom drew of the lizard folk, they seem far more animal/monster like than Keidran, at leasyt physically wise"
30-01-2021T18:12:03,ZapiliDver,Stonks?
30-01-2021T18:12:06,Zakuru,Just gotta be more creative with certain keidran species~ >w>
30-01-2021T18:12:13,ScaredGhost,X3
30-01-2021T18:12:23,MoonDance,Besides their defense of smelling like strong burn weed- they're pretty cute
30-01-2021T18:12:58,Skornos,"That ""I'm Helping"" was funny. Remind me of Abe ""Grandpa"" Simpson! ""I'm usefull!"""
30-01-2021T18:13:05,Zakuru,"Skunks do NOT smell like weed, they smell like fucking sulfur!"
30-01-2021T18:13:11,BlueStreak98,"Skunks are quite cute. I had the misfortunate of having to... eliminate one several years back, and he was the cutest litlte thing"
30-01-2021T18:13:20,hyneria,:(
30-01-2021T18:13:25,BlueStreak98,"But very unwell, had to do what I had to do"

30-01-2021T18:13:36,ScaredGhost,Sad rip
30-01-2021T18:13:37,ZapiliDver,"I'm glad, that they not live in my country."
30-01-2021T18:13:46,Skornos,Like... Kill? Or just chase away?

30-01-2021T18:26:19,ZapiliDver,Hi Sleepy
30-01-2021T18:26:20,hyneria,also dragons are very intelligent. Nibbly lacks that
30-01-2021T18:26:35,Katfeathers,The reveal should be interesting
30-01-2021T18:26:48,Mandag,The willow one was very moody and well drawn even in sketch form. Will be great to see it in color form

30-01-2021T18:27:40,Skornos,"Also, she is far too smart for an squirrel."
30-01-2021T18:27:50,hyneria,also she nearly got killed by carver. She would be one really weak dragon then :P
30-01-2021T18:28:15,Skornos,Or a REALLY good actor.
30-01-2021T18:28:18,Mandag,"I dunno, maybe Carver's just got a hell of a throwing arm?"
30-01-2021T18:28:40,Katfeathers,A) squirrel form drawbacks B) young
30-01-2021T18:29:02,hyneria,I dunno. All of the scenes that show her as very intellingent are patreon sketches
30-01-2021T18:29:12,hyneria,in the comic she behaves like a dog would
30-01-2021T18:29:26,SleepyProductions,I think the squirrel is indestructible

30-01-2021T18:30:22,Skornos,"Honestly, I think an actual squirrel would had just died. She acted like just barely having survived it due to sheer luck, while actually not getting harmed at all-cause Dragon."

30-01-2021T18:31:11,Ordithus,squirrels do survive falls out of trees all the time

30-01-2021T18:31:47,ZapiliDver,"falls off the trees, not throw in the trees"
30-01-2021T18:31:48,Skornos,An fall is not an throw. Completely different accelaration.
30-01-2021T18:31:51,BadFoMo,What if Nibbly is an Alien or a Robot?!
30-01-2021T18:31:57,Katfeathers,We did however get to hear/read the snap

30-01-2021T18:32:10,hyneria,and pretty much shrugged it off

30-01-2021T18:34:32,hyneria,I think if she is something other than just a squirrel
30-01-2021T18:34:39,hyneria,she might be a thing like Willow

30-01-2021T18:49:53,Skornos,"It's already to late to escape the Malicious Dog Hair stylist... Poor guy. Even Nibbly in her true, draconic Shape can't help him anymore now."
30-01-2021T18:49:54,ChromaticBard,I read that as bad wolf and got Doctor Who flashbacks
30-01-2021T18:50:36,Skornos,Furcut: I'm Inevitable.
30-01-2021T18:51:13,Skornos,Nibbly: I'm Iron Squirrel.
30-01-2021T18:51:28,ZapiliDver,Nibbly: I'm T-800
30-01-2021T18:52:01,CheddarCat,How's the night?
30-01-2021T18:52:14,KeefMcDerpface,cold
30-01-2021T18:52:18,Skornos,"Makes one think, who would win? T-800 or Iron Man?"
30-01-2021T18:52:40,ZapiliDver,"Hmm, a good question"
30-01-2021T18:52:44,CrRAR,"iron, mange"
30-01-2021T18:52:45,ChromaticBard,Night is nonexistant right now
30-01-2021T18:52:49,Feralsparky,t-800 stands no chance
30-01-2021T18:53:17,Feralsparky,He can be taken down with conventional weapons. Iron Man has shield technology
30-01-2021T18:53:53,Rainelover,"Good lord, the contrast between that highly detailed water and the currently flat colors of the rest of the picture is immense"
30-01-2021T18:54:06,Skornos,"I mean Iron mean has all that squishy and vulnerable flesh in it, but has all those hightech weapons. I guess as long as he's using only ranged weapons."
30-01-2021T18:54:39,Feralsparky,The t-800 would not be able to crush his suit
30-01-2021T18:55:08,Feralsparky,It took a beating from Thanos who is much stronger than a t-800 and survived
30-01-2021T18:55:24,Skornos,"Ye think so? I think, if the T-800 gets somehow hold of the suit..."
30-01-2021T18:55:54,Skornos,I withdraw my argument.
30-01-2021T18:56:11,Feralsparky,Then the suit will dump tony and go into autonomous mode.  and he can get into another suit while the terminator deals with an AI controlled death machine
30-01-2021T18:56:12,Skornos,Didn't seen the last part.
30-01-2021T18:56:18,Katfeathers,Ya thinking Ultron moment?
30-01-2021T18:56:52,Skornos,Was also kinda stuck mentally with the suit from the first movie.
30-01-2021T18:57:03,Feralsparky,Yeah
30-01-2021T18:57:04,Katfeathers,Ah
30-01-2021T18:57:13,Feralsparky,Where it took time to take off. His later ones were instant
30-01-2021T18:57:32,unsteddyphoenix,but the T-800 will be back

30-01-2021T18:57:49,unsteddyphoenix,o/
30-01-2021T18:57:54,Feralsparky,Hmm... maybe I should do a terminator talking to Tony recording

30-01-2021T18:58:00,Feralsparky,Gimmie a minute
30-01-2021T18:58:35,Skornos,"Yeah. And even more impressive than being able to survive an hit by thanos, it was also able to keep him alive long enough to do the snap"
30-01-2021T18:59:00,Feralsparky,What would the Terminator say to Tony?
30-01-2021T18:59:02,Feralsparky,I need ideas
30-01-2021T18:59:08,Skornos,Which is more imressive than all hydrogen bombs together.
30-01-2021T18:59:25,SpazztasticKiwi,and here I thought Tony was dead

30-01-2021T19:00:37,Rainelover,"Yeah, but tony died from the snap, unless he‚Äôs willing to kill himself along with the terminator, then the snap is not an option"

30-01-2021T19:55:00,Roughlandin,"Not where she wound up, I imagine"
30-01-2021T19:55:09,KeefMcDerpface,She was going to visit her mother...
30-01-2021T19:55:14,Ordithus,she never arrived
30-01-2021T19:55:15,CrRAR,over the river and through the woods~
30-01-2021T19:55:21,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-EmberSad:
30-01-2021T19:56:02,w0lfmare,Thanks!
30-01-2021T19:56:07,w0lfmare,Hi Tom!
30-01-2021T19:56:07,Mandag,"Over the hills and far away, she swore she would return one day. As sure as a river will reach the sea, back in his arms she will soon be"
30-01-2021T19:56:07,CrRAR,this is probably a better ending than a big bad wolf or something
30-01-2021T19:56:18,w0lfmare,Yeah I'm here for the sadness
30-01-2021T19:56:33,Roughlandin,Willow's friend's gramma warned her not to take the shortcut through Urgona-dii Wood
30-01-2021T19:57:10,ChromaticBard,Woo about to play some dnd
30-01-2021T19:57:13,Ordithus,"w0lf, if Tom made more sad, would that sate your appetite and Ember could be happy?"
30-01-2021T19:57:26,Roughlandin,"Good luck, Bard. Don't die!"
30-01-2021T19:57:27,CrRAR,:cw0lfmare-EmberTooHappy:

30-01-2021T19:58:00,Skornos,"Btw, did she had a Name?"
30-01-2021T19:58:01,Ordithus,have fun bard
30-01-2021T19:58:15,ChromaticBard,Finally getting to play my tabaxi bard in a serious campaign.
30-01-2021T19:58:16,Roughlandin,"Not that we know of yet, Skornos"
30-01-2021T19:58:25,Roughlandin,Willow just called her... friend
30-01-2021T19:58:36,Mandag,"It is late at night, but I must hang around for background details"
30-01-2021T19:58:49,KeefMcDerpface,Need coffee?
30-01-2021T19:58:58,Mandag,"No, I have work tomorrow lol"
30-01-2021T19:59:09,Mandag,I need to sleep after I see this drawing
30-01-2021T19:59:37,ZapiliDver,With some nightmares?
30-01-2021T19:59:44,Mandag,"Nah, I live for this stuff"
30-01-2021T19:59:54,Mandag,The sads
30-01-2021T20:00:04,BlueStreak98,Some sads are good from time to time
30-01-2021T20:00:33,Roughlandin,"Long as it's not Keith. Keith's had enough sad, dang it"
30-01-2021T20:00:45,Katfeathers,Arr
30-01-2021T20:00:49,Mandag,"I like me some variety. The semi-lewd sketches are nice, yeah, but the moody ones are my favorites."
30-01-2021T20:01:15,Ordithus,"yeah, I also like the badass/awesome pieces"
30-01-2021T20:01:22,Ordithus,"those are nice, too"
30-01-2021T20:01:39,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,me need more mafia AU
30-01-2021T20:01:53,w0lfmare,@Ordithus No it'll just give me more ideas
30-01-2021T20:01:57,BlueStreak98,I actually had a Keith sad idea... doubt I'll do anything with it though
30-01-2021T20:01:59,RimaDraws,we do need more mafia AU
30-01-2021T20:02:00,Ordithus,I see
30-01-2021T20:02:04,Roughlandin,"Speaking of, surprised Queen of Greed didn't make top five"

30-01-2021T20:02:28,steelabjur,"Keith is the O'brian of TK, born to suffer."
30-01-2021T20:02:31,Mandag,Not personally a fan of AU stuff. I really likes when he just expands the universe from the main comic instead. Like this one.
30-01-2021T20:02:37,Ordithus,"too many good sketches, can't have all of them be top 5"
30-01-2021T20:02:43,DanteWolfington,Heya Everyone!
30-01-2021T20:02:50,Roughlandin,Hi Dante

30-01-2021T20:03:06,DanteWolfington,"Oh geez, so many hellos!"
30-01-2021T20:03:20,Ordithus,I like the AU stuff for seeing something outside of the usual. Especially like seeing Tom make modern backgrounds
30-01-2021T20:03:21,unsteddyphoenix,Problem is the fans arent the writers so we dont know how tor request canon lore lol
30-01-2021T20:03:24,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Hi Dante
30-01-2021T20:03:27,Skornos,"May I ask, why is Clovis so loved anyway? Didn't he only appeared on like three pages?"
30-01-2021T20:03:30,Roughlandin,"We're a welcoming bunch here, Dante"
30-01-2021T20:03:36,DCMmesher,Oh shit I thought TOM was on break but turns out I accidently pause the livestream x.x
30-01-2021T20:03:43,Ordithus,"he stars in the side comic, the dragon masquerade, skornos"
30-01-2021T20:03:44,Roughlandin,"Clovis is currently the main villain, Skornos"
30-01-2021T20:03:52,Mandag,"Skornos, Clovis was the main antagonist of The Dragon Masquerade. That's where he was introduced"
30-01-2021T20:03:58,BlueStreak98,also he's hot
30-01-2021T20:04:10,Roughlandin,"Well, besides like... Trace. Old Trace is the other main villain"
30-01-2021T20:04:15,DanteWolfington,Can I admit something here thats sorta silly and embarrassing?
30-01-2021T20:04:16,Mandag,Also Brahn

30-01-2021T20:06:05,Combak,"Still, nice winners."
30-01-2021T20:06:05,Skornos,Didn't knew that Comic... Only the original twokinds.
30-01-2021T20:06:08,Mandag,"Wow, you Camebak"
30-01-2021T20:06:11,Skornos,But that I completelye read in two days.

30-01-2021T20:06:24,Combak,"Hi Keff, Rough, Zapili, Ord, Teddy."
30-01-2021T20:06:30,Ordithus,"hmm you should read it again, but slower. ABSORB it"
30-01-2021T20:06:31,Mandag,Hello Combak
30-01-2021T20:06:41,KeefMcDerpface,What Ord said.
30-01-2021T20:06:44,DanteWolfington,"Sorta, but not exactly @unsteddyphoenix"
30-01-2021T20:07:01,Roughlandin,Read it again. Give me a 10 page report on the literary themes... and how they relate to butts
30-01-2021T20:07:14,ZapiliDver,All is related tu butts
30-01-2021T20:07:22,Roughlandin,Zap gets an A
30-01-2021T20:07:24,Skornos,I always read fast. And I always absorb-when it's good.
30-01-2021T20:07:42,ZapiliDver,Butts is a root of everything
30-01-2021T20:07:47,unsteddyphoenix,But you didnt know who saria was :thinking:
30-01-2021T20:07:52,KeefMcDerpface,^
30-01-2021T20:08:03,KeefMcDerpface,That means they missed the good bits.
30-01-2021T20:08:09,Skornos,I knew Saria
30-01-2021T20:08:23,Combak,"It sounds like Skornos read and absorbed it, they might just not have retained it. :p"
30-01-2021T20:08:33,Skornos,Just not about Lion saria
30-01-2021T20:08:43,unsteddyphoenix,Read it 3 more times
30-01-2021T20:08:48,Combak,"Oh, that's sketch canon only anyways."
30-01-2021T20:09:03,Roughlandin,Everybody has a keidran version or a human version. Some have basitin and dragon versions too
30-01-2021T20:09:06,Skornos,There was no Lion Saria in the Comic
30-01-2021T20:09:14,Roughlandin,Welcome to the Sketchverse
30-01-2021T20:09:21,Katfeathers,Well Lion Saria was in sketch suggestions
30-01-2021T20:09:26,InTheLionsDen,"No, only in the sketch alternate times."
30-01-2021T20:09:39,Roughlandin,(Laura Lives AU is the tru tru canon)

30-01-2021T20:10:49,DanteWolfington,"So, I've known about TwoKinds for a good while...probably since 16 or 17, I'm 25 (context), HOWEVER, I've been watching Markiplier for 3 or 4 years, NEVER knew they were related xD not even a CLUE they even had anything at all to do with each other, lmao!"

30-01-2021T20:12:15,Roughlandin,That's all he's known for.
30-01-2021T20:12:22,Skornos,Never heard of him
30-01-2021T20:12:23,BadFoMo,E?
30-01-2021T20:12:24,DanteWolfington,"I mean, if you say so @Ordithus xD I wouldn't know at all"
30-01-2021T20:12:26,KeefMcDerpface,A youtuber? Thought it was a game I never heard of.

30-01-2021T20:13:53,Roughlandin,Tom's younger brother. He makes a crud ton of money as a youtuber
30-01-2021T20:13:56,Roughlandin,Bye Dante

30-01-2021T22:15:59,Roughlandin,Kei knows that the life of a Guard Captain is 20% guard work and 80% compulsively polishing your boots and armor
30-01-2021T22:16:14,MoonDance,It makes her less scary- a perfect trap to lure a handsome blond guar- I mean Random citizen!
30-01-2021T22:17:09,Roughlandin,Warrior dragons capture human princesses. Princess dragons capture human warriors

30-01-2021T22:19:40,Roughlandin,Tom's been really good about combining these similar suggestions on color week recently. Did the same for VV Mike and Kat
30-01-2021T22:19:58,Roughlandin,Tom is a generous Tom

30-01-2021T22:20:46,vevans0009,Am hopeful.....
30-01-2021T22:21:04,Skornos,How does clovis make sure she doesn't turn human again? Has he an spell? As an dragon she's still dangerous after all!
30-01-2021T22:21:22,Twokinds,??
30-01-2021T22:21:27,vevans0009,Huh?
30-01-2021T22:21:41,Roughlandin,You mean Reni?
30-01-2021T22:21:56,Skornos,Clovis captured Kei to get to Reni...
30-01-2021T22:22:01,vevans0009,That wouldn't help CLovis at all. xD
30-01-2021T22:22:08,Ordithus,... that was a joke
30-01-2021T22:22:20,vevans0009,I guess.
30-01-2021T22:22:21,Roughlandin,"Oh how does Clovis keep RENI from turning into a dragon in that situation, you mean"
30-01-2021T22:22:23,ProsePro7,No but he would do it for entertainment
30-01-2021T22:22:27,vevans0009,Ah
30-01-2021T22:22:39,vevans0009,That be worrisome
30-01-2021T22:22:47,Skornos,Yes
30-01-2021T22:22:51,ProsePro7,Not to mention that I think Clovis might have a grudge on Reni she did smack Brutus
30-01-2021T22:23:00,Roughlandin,Two-thousand-two-zero. Party over. Oops. Out of time.
30-01-2021T22:23:07,Zakuru,heheh thats true
30-01-2021T22:23:08,Ordithus,Clovis probably has a hatred for all dragons
30-01-2021T22:23:15,vevans0009,"Oh yeah Clovis ""cares"" about Burtus for realsies."
30-01-2021T22:23:26,vevans0009,"""brutus"""
30-01-2021T22:23:27,vevans0009,omg
30-01-2021T22:23:29,Roughlandin,Clovis hates anybody more powerful than him. And most people less powerful than him
30-01-2021T22:23:35,Roughlandin,"...Everybody but Brutus, basically"
30-01-2021T22:23:36,steelabjur,"Well, if Clovis knew Reni had feelings for Kei, he might kidnap Kei to get back at Reni for making him think Brutus was dead."
30-01-2021T22:23:44,ProsePro7,Still waiting to see if he kills Brutus in the next comic since he sees him as a weakness
30-01-2021T22:23:53,GammaEradon,"I haven't seen Tom sketch the next page...but the dialogue from the last page made it seem like Clovis was about to off Brutus in a ""I can't afford to have any weaknesses"" thing."
30-01-2021T22:23:55,vevans0009,I doubt it
30-01-2021T22:23:58,GammaEradon,"Yeah, what Prose said."
30-01-2021T22:24:02,vevans0009,That embrace

30-01-2021T22:24:06,BlueStreak98,Clovis is so not going to kill Brutus
30-01-2021T22:24:13,GammaEradon,"Well, not with fire anyway."
30-01-2021T22:24:15,steelabjur,I also doubt it.
30-01-2021T22:24:23,GammaEradon,"Would be a bummer, no doubt"
30-01-2021T22:24:39,Roughlandin,INB4 Tom hears you guys and kills Brutus just to troll your expectations now
30-01-2021T22:24:46,vevans0009,Nice embrace tooo

30-01-2021T22:25:31,Roughlandin,Guess we'll find out how valuable Brutus really is
30-01-2021T22:25:35,BlueStreak98,there's definitely some misinterpretation going on there
30-01-2021T22:25:48,vevans0009,He woofs
