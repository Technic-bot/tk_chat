28-02-2021T13:08:08,Rainelover,Count because of accidental voter fraud
28-02-2021T14:02:08,SpazztasticKiwi,how is it accidental when you knew you should be or able to vote and did it anyway

28-02-2021T17:12:52,CrRAR,wb
28-02-2021T17:16:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel so horrible for this woman
28-02-2021T17:17:06,SpazztasticKiwi,she was engaged & asked her husband to be to pick something up before coming home one night
28-02-2021T17:17:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"he walked into the store, robbery was going on"
28-02-2021T17:17:36,SpazztasticKiwi,they shot him
28-02-2021T17:20:23,SpazztasticKiwi,the show is set 30 years later  - they finally tracked down the robber
28-02-2021T17:25:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"on the other hand, there’s a cat on my leg"
28-02-2021T17:25:30,SpazztasticKiwi,putting it to sleep
28-02-2021T17:36:08,CrRAR,did they interview him or was it just to apprehend him?
28-02-2021T17:36:16,CrRAR,any remorse or anything?
28-02-2021T17:40:42,SpazztasticKiwi,the fiancé was a cop  - so was the man that got shot - but they found the gun and she used it to track him down
28-02-2021T17:41:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"he’d gotten clean, started a reform home for youths, church regular, all that good stuff"
28-02-2021T17:41:43,SpazztasticKiwi,all in an effort as he said to make up for the life he took because he thought of him every day
28-02-2021T17:42:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"but as she said, he could’ve turned himself in"
28-02-2021T17:44:13,CrRAR,yeah
28-02-2021T17:44:30,CrRAR,probably mostly accepted one day it might catch up to him
28-02-2021T17:45:25,SpazztasticKiwi,he told her that for months he lived in fear to go outside cause he thought it was only a matter of time before they came busting down his door
28-02-2021T17:46:13,SpazztasticKiwi,the whole conversation was very calm - he didn’t deny anything or fight her
28-02-2021T17:46:29,SpazztasticKiwi,he walked to the station with her
28-02-2021T17:47:05,SpazztasticKiwi,he said that he thought not getting caught was God’s way of giving him a second chance
28-02-2021T17:47:23,SpazztasticKiwi,but God gave man free will
28-02-2021T17:48:02,CrRAR,"yeah, well that, but it is a better sign it did affect him, didn't just keep living his other lifestyle"
28-02-2021T17:48:08,SpazztasticKiwi,that includes to do the right thing like turn yourself in for killing a man when they don’t catch you
28-02-2021T17:48:17,CrRAR,yeah
28-02-2021T17:48:54,CrRAR,I feel like in sentencing they would take his later choices into account
28-02-2021T17:49:08,CrRAR,even if it doesn't completely absolve him
28-02-2021T17:49:25,SpazztasticKiwi,now he’s going to jail and leaving about 4 kids and even a wife
28-02-2021T17:49:48,CrRAR,that's a bunch of kids
28-02-2021T17:50:30,SpazztasticKiwi,how’s that going to effect them
28-02-2021T17:50:33,SpazztasticKiwi,and the wife
28-02-2021T17:51:25,CrRAR,"well, probably a complete shock to them too to be sure"
28-02-2021T17:51:47,CrRAR,trust is shattered
28-02-2021T17:51:56,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe they know he had a drug problem and did some things
28-02-2021T17:52:04,CrRAR,maybe
28-02-2021T17:52:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"but no, he killed a man, a cop at that"
28-02-2021T17:52:27,SpazztasticKiwi,and never owned up to it
28-02-2021T17:53:28,CrRAR,"folks too often find themselves in bad circumstances, worse if it's not entirely their fault"
28-02-2021T17:53:34,CrRAR,"put fire near gasoline, you're asking for trouble"
28-02-2021T17:54:46,CrRAR,"like people don't often think beyond themselves, or beyond instant gratification"
28-02-2021T17:54:59,CrRAR,leads to bad stuff
28-02-2021T17:57:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"“you may have fixed yourself, worked to grow and improve but what you built here was built on the back of a dead man”"
28-02-2021T17:57:06,SpazztasticKiwi,ow
28-02-2021T17:57:13,SpazztasticKiwi,but is she wrong
28-02-2021T17:57:41,CrRAR,well maybe she means like motivated by the tragedy
28-02-2021T17:57:59,CrRAR,like it was his springboard to change
28-02-2021T17:58:54,SpazztasticKiwi,a person who looks like they weren’t even 25 yet shouldn’t have to die for someone to realize they need to change
28-02-2021T17:59:27,CrRAR,exactly
28-02-2021T18:04:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"in a more lighthearted story, these kids threw rocks at some crows"
28-02-2021T18:04:36,SpazztasticKiwi,crows attacked em
28-02-2021T18:04:45,SpazztasticKiwi,don’t mess with crows
28-02-2021T18:04:50,CrRAR,crows are very vengeful
28-02-2021T18:05:00,CrRAR,they will remember
28-02-2021T18:05:07,CrRAR,they will find them
28-02-2021T18:05:29,SpazztasticKiwi,and they will try their diddly darndest to kill you
28-02-2021T18:05:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"and in theory, could"

28-02-2021T21:46:31,CrRAR,just natural turnover really I guess
