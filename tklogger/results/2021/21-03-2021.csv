21-03-2021T00:11:12,SpazztasticKiwi,everybody dropping out to get to bed at reasonable times like responsible adults
21-03-2021T00:11:14,SpazztasticKiwi,egh
21-03-2021T00:13:15,Twokinds,not me
21-03-2021T00:18:56,SpazztasticKiwi,of course not you
21-03-2021T00:19:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not entirely convinced you sleep at all
21-03-2021T00:22:43,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-power::coffee::coffee::coffee:
21-03-2021T00:23:29,Dadrobit,"Back, lost track of time."
21-03-2021T00:23:39,Dadrobit,The stream go well?
21-03-2021T00:23:47,Twokinds,fairly well
21-03-2021T00:23:50,Twokinds,Didn't finish. Two to go
21-03-2021T00:24:07,Dadrobit,"Ah, these things happen."
21-03-2021T00:25:04,Dadrobit,Holy frijoles! Not a single vote for Undercover Finale.
21-03-2021T00:25:26,Dadrobit,The road ahead will be arduous.
21-03-2021T00:26:21,SpazztasticKiwi,oh I didn‚Äôt check mine
21-03-2021T00:29:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom at what point will you stop drinking coffee & set up a drip
21-03-2021T00:30:48,SonOfGoku,Who's to say he hasn't already?
21-03-2021T00:35:33,SpazztasticKiwi,he is quite stationary according to legend
21-03-2021T00:35:59,Twokinds,That seems like too much work.
21-03-2021T00:37:05,SpazztasticKiwi,more work than traveling to the kitchen to make and refill coffee normally?
21-03-2021T00:37:33,Twokinds,Set up cost
21-03-2021T00:37:41,SpazztasticKiwi,true
21-03-2021T00:37:47,SpazztasticKiwi,v important factor
21-03-2021T00:38:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"& speaking of stationary, your mom shared her birthday card"
21-03-2021T00:38:57,SpazztasticKiwi,congratulations - you made a cluster of her followers implode with mush
21-03-2021T00:40:25,SpazztasticKiwi,but I learned my cousin set up a sewing machine for her workshop
21-03-2021T00:40:51,SpazztasticKiwi,she‚Äôs making berets
21-03-2021T00:41:41,Dadrobit,\o/ Hadn't checked on one of the authors I'm following in a while. Just looked him up and he released a new book just a few days ago!
21-03-2021T00:41:53,Dadrobit,Fortuitous timing!
21-03-2021T00:42:39,SpazztasticKiwi,there‚Äôs a copycat on ig reposting the sketches
21-03-2021T00:43:02,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúfanpage‚Äù
21-03-2021T00:44:07,Twokinds,lol
21-03-2021T00:44:11,Twokinds,Man
21-03-2021T00:44:28,Dadrobit,"Looked up what you meant, Spazz. ""The furries adore your son."" Pffft, lmao, can't escape em."
21-03-2021T00:45:25,Dadrobit,"But happy birthday to your mom my dude, wish her the best!"
21-03-2021T00:45:45,Twokinds,Yeah
21-03-2021T00:46:53,Twokinds,I couldn't figure out what to get her other than money so I just cleaned the house while she was out with her friends.
21-03-2021T00:47:02,Twokinds,That's all I could think to do.
21-03-2021T00:48:30,Dadrobit,"I of course can't speak for your mom, but me personally, I actually quite enjoy money. Way more than giftcards at the very least."
21-03-2021T00:49:06,Twokinds,"Oh yeah, I'm sure she was fine with it."
21-03-2021T00:49:06,SpazztasticKiwi,aw
21-03-2021T00:49:16,SpazztasticKiwi,well you thought to do something
21-03-2021T00:49:20,Dadrobit,That's good!
21-03-2021T00:49:20,SpazztasticKiwi,that counts
21-03-2021T00:49:49,Twokinds,"She doesn't make a big deal about birthdays, same as me. Honestly, I think she's just happy I remembered. XD"
21-03-2021T00:50:07,Twokinds,"I have all birthdays of people I know in my calendar now, since I'm so forgetful."
21-03-2021T00:50:15,SpazztasticKiwi,it was exactly like when Amy tweeted at Mark about him bringing her coffee every morning to her workshop
21-03-2021T00:50:24,SpazztasticKiwi,twitter couldn‚Äôt handle it
21-03-2021T00:51:11,Dadrobit,"I only have FaceBook at all anymore for the birthday reminders and the occasional work post update, (and very rare interaction)."
21-03-2021T00:51:12,SpazztasticKiwi,thoughtfulness makes people lose their minds I guess
21-03-2021T00:51:23,SpazztasticKiwi,tho it was pretty sweet
21-03-2021T00:51:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not completely made of stone so I awwwwed too
21-03-2021T00:58:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I probably know more birthdays of people I follow than I‚Äôm related to

21-03-2021T15:00:34,AspiringNoodle,"A bunch of family (parents, aunts / uncles, etc) are planning to go to Jamaica this year to celebrate my one Aunt's wedding"
21-03-2021T15:00:50,AspiringNoodle,"Originally the plan was to have the wedding there, but COVID."
21-03-2021T15:01:03,AspiringNoodle,"Meanwhile, I'm just like, ""I have 0 interest in flying to Jamaica."""
21-03-2021T15:05:06,SonOfGoku,Hopefully they don't force you into going
21-03-2021T15:08:39,AspiringNoodle,Nah
21-03-2021T15:08:55,AspiringNoodle,My plane ticket in particular is a kind that can be returned for the full cost up to a certain point
21-03-2021T15:09:12,AspiringNoodle,"But they keep talking about Jamaica, and discussing the things available there"
21-03-2021T15:09:28,AspiringNoodle,But I get absolutely zero excitement or interest
21-03-2021T15:10:03,AspiringNoodle,"Apparently the hotel we'll be staying at has a nice pool, a really big one that even has a swim-up bar, as well as a bunch of other bars scattered around the property"
21-03-2021T15:11:03,AspiringNoodle,But 1) I drink VERY modestly.  It's generally 1 drink per few months and 2) I'm a combination of 80+ lbs overweight and pale af.  So a trip to a tropical island isn't my cup of tea.
21-03-2021T15:17:13,SonOfGoku,Fair enough
21-03-2021T15:40:30,CrRAR,"I like the more natural part of tropical vacations, tbh."
21-03-2021T15:40:50,CrRAR,but yeah sometimes being resort-bound is a bit of a drag
21-03-2021T15:41:06,CrRAR,"the amenities are amazing, but tourist-trappy"
21-03-2021T15:41:43,CrRAR,there are honestly though some destinations you wouldn't want to wander depending on suroundings
21-03-2021T15:42:15,CrRAR,but you don't always get the sense of a place in resorts
21-03-2021T15:43:14,CrRAR,maybe gravitating toward national parks or preserves is a good strategy
21-03-2021T15:44:31,CrRAR,"I do advocate for travel though in general, it's priceless experiences, but the timing is still a bit nerve-wracking"
