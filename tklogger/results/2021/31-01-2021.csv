31-01-2021T01:20:10,Roughlandin,Trip over a curb?
31-01-2021T01:20:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I got up to this curb when the back of my mind told me you might not want to do that

31-01-2021T01:21:10,Roughlandin,WOAH. That's a bit of a drop
31-01-2021T01:21:33,Folfgirl,Yeah it is
31-01-2021T01:21:35,SpazztasticKiwi,five feet
31-01-2021T01:21:53,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe 6 but I‚Äôm not a measuring tape
31-01-2021T01:22:05,Roughlandin,Thankfully our instincts take over when our brains are being dumb
31-01-2021T01:22:49,Roughlandin,"Except when they do that thing where you get to the top of the stairs and think there's an extra stair, but there isn't"
31-01-2021T01:23:02,Roughlandin,*Flailing panic.*
31-01-2021T01:23:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a problem with stairs
31-01-2021T01:23:28,Roughlandin,Stairs are tricky. It's always the last one
31-01-2021T01:23:31,SpazztasticKiwi,they mess with my balance
31-01-2021T01:23:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve never fallen down stairs but they give me a bad feeling anyway
31-01-2021T01:24:18,SpazztasticKiwi,same with going down escalators
31-01-2021T01:24:21,Roughlandin,I've missed a step and fallen halfway down a flight once. Wasn't fun.
31-01-2021T01:24:30,Roughlandin,"Nothing broke, thankfully"
31-01-2021T01:24:36,Roughlandin,Sore butt tho
31-01-2021T01:25:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I think it‚Äôs got to do with heights
31-01-2021T01:25:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I can‚Äôt do heights
31-01-2021T01:25:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm liable to get stuck on a stool
31-01-2021T01:25:26,Roughlandin,Heights I can do. It's ledges that are the problem
31-01-2021T01:25:58,Folfgirl,Nether can I
31-01-2021T01:26:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"if I can‚Äôt put a leg under myself and feel the ground when coming off a stool, I‚Äôm stuck"
31-01-2021T01:26:44,Folfgirl,What if you're swimming?
31-01-2021T01:26:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I can swim
31-01-2021T01:27:27,Roughlandin,Water is no problem. Bears are bouyant
31-01-2021T01:27:34,SpazztasticKiwi,also wasps
31-01-2021T01:27:37,SpazztasticKiwi,no
31-01-2021T01:27:48,Roughlandin,Stingy bugs are yuck
31-01-2021T01:27:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I will run you over if you‚Äôre in the way of getting away
31-01-2021T01:28:19,Roughlandin,Same with horse flies. Evil bastards
31-01-2021T01:29:29,Roughlandin,Holy crud it's 1:30.
31-01-2021T01:29:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw a video where this girl had been hearing buzzing from her wall outlet
31-01-2021T01:29:42,SpazztasticKiwi,turns out there was a wasp trapped behind it
31-01-2021T01:29:47,Roughlandin,Nope!
31-01-2021T01:29:51,Roughlandin,Nopenopenope
31-01-2021T01:30:10,Roughlandin,"Think I'm gonna leave you on that one, Kiwi"
31-01-2021T01:30:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd be calling an exterminator from outside

31-01-2021T14:35:01,SonOfGoku,What's the evil plot this time?
31-01-2021T14:36:20,CrimsonQuill,"Roughlandin made a 'story comment' from the perspective of a Templar official ordering explorers and field operatives to cease fraternization with the keidran they met, owing to an unprecedented loss of operatives owing to marriages and such"

31-01-2021T14:36:36,CrimsonQuill,So...I decided to write a reply...from the perspective of one of the explorers.
31-01-2021T14:36:53,CrimsonQuill,I'm basically just going to use Rough's writing as an aid in practicing my own.
31-01-2021T14:36:56,CrimsonQuill,'Cause it's funny
31-01-2021T14:37:07,CrimsonQuill,Heeheehee!
31-01-2021T14:38:18,SonOfGoku,That's diabolical!
31-01-2021T14:38:54,CrimsonQuill,None shall stop me! I shall see further by standing on the fluffy shoulders of giant sneps and bears and allsorts!

31-01-2021T14:51:36,SonOfGoku,Sounds like good has triumphed over evil once again
31-01-2021T14:51:59,SonOfGoku,Sorry to hear that though
31-01-2021T14:54:24,CrimsonQuill,"@SonOfGoku could you please do me a favour, and just check to see if Roughlandin's story comment has a wall of text beneath it?"
