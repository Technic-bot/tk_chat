19-02-2021T00:00:39,SageSaga,"so i went into the comment section of one of the animes ive been watching- and someone said ""if that ability is so terrible they should have made a bigger deal about it!"""
19-02-2021T00:00:51,ShamusTheFox,?
19-02-2021T00:00:57,ContagiousBordem16,Nvm
19-02-2021T00:01:04,SageSaga,"and my only thought was ""They put it in big red bloody letters when they showed it- that took up the entire screen"""
19-02-2021T00:01:08,ShamusTheFox,...that's an odd comment.

19-02-2021T00:02:40,SageSaga,"someone started arguing with them after that comment - and i was like ""Wait- you are both stupid- you are both talking about the wrong thing- is this what happens when two idiots disagree?"""
19-02-2021T00:03:00,CrRAR,brrr
19-02-2021T00:03:13,ShamusTheFox,30 Helens Agree
19-02-2021T00:03:15,Roughlandin,The comment section isn't about being right so much as being loud
19-02-2021T00:04:16,ShamusTheFox,Everyone wants to have their voice heard and no one wants to back down.
19-02-2021T00:04:29,Ordithus,:eyes:
19-02-2021T00:04:31,unsteddyphoenix,And then SAGE left a comment...
19-02-2021T00:04:52,SageSaga,i did XD
19-02-2021T00:04:58,Roughlandin,Lol
19-02-2021T00:05:12,RevGaming,did sage commit murder by words?
19-02-2021T00:05:19,Roughlandin,":eyes: Don't know who she is but I like her already, Tom"
19-02-2021T00:05:32,unsteddyphoenix,Of course lol
19-02-2021T00:05:41,Twokinds,i dunno
19-02-2021T00:05:45,ShamusTheFox,Looks like shower pic
19-02-2021T00:05:59,SageSaga,"i said ""you are both talking about X when you mean Z, also Z was written in bloody letters and they spent 3 times in 3 different episodes talking about how scary it sounds"
19-02-2021T00:06:26,ShamusTheFox,What anime is this? I am curious about context.
19-02-2021T00:06:46,SageSaga,"So Im a Spider, so what?"
19-02-2021T00:07:04,unsteddyphoenix,Oh I need to watch that
19-02-2021T00:07:10,ShamusTheFox,Hmm. I will look into it.

19-02-2021T00:07:30,SageSaga,the opening theme goes way harder than it should XD
19-02-2021T00:07:49,Twokinds,I don't have anything else to work on so I'm going to end things here

19-02-2021T00:08:10,unsteddyphoenix,The conclusion!
19-02-2021T00:08:18,SageSaga,"its like ""hey! cool anime stuff! yeah! Now watch this girl bite into the world and have blood gush down her body!"" ""wait- what"""
19-02-2021T00:08:19,Twokinds,Too tired

19-02-2021T00:13:23,SpazztasticKiwi,what spam
19-02-2021T00:13:29,KeefMcDerpface,hello Dad
19-02-2021T00:13:32,Dadrobit,"Hey Sage, I forgot to mention, I spoke with the museum director!"
19-02-2021T00:13:37,SageSaga,oh?
19-02-2021T00:13:38,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, Dadrobit."
19-02-2021T00:13:38,Roughlandin,Deathclaw misclicked and accidently spammed chat
19-02-2021T00:13:48,RevGaming,spam is tasty
19-02-2021T00:13:50,ShamusTheFox,"OK, I watched that video, and yes it does go hard. I also have absolutely no idea what the show is supposed to be about just from the intro."
19-02-2021T00:14:44,0crop,"Well, thanks for the stream Tom"
19-02-2021T00:14:45,SageSaga,classroom blows up suddenly- there souls get sent and reincarnated in another world that uses a game like system
19-02-2021T00:14:52,ShamusTheFox,Is it spider mechs? Is it sword and sorcery? Is it about a bad guy who wants to eat the world?
19-02-2021T00:14:53,Roughlandin,Yeah that intro really goes right for it lol
19-02-2021T00:14:58,SageSaga,one of the souls ends up in a spider monster body
19-02-2021T00:15:14,ShamusTheFox,"Ah, I see!"
19-02-2021T00:15:34,SageSaga,the woman eating the world is the demon lord- cant say shes evil or has any intention of eating the world actually
19-02-2021T00:15:52,Roughlandin,Gave me like Digimon meets Overlord vibes lol
19-02-2021T00:16:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw the explanation
19-02-2021T00:16:47,SpazztasticKiwi,what kind of spam is the question
19-02-2021T00:16:49,ShamusTheFox,I like bad guys who aren't crazy over the top evil. I like more nuanced evil.
19-02-2021T00:17:06,Ordithus,:csagesaga-nynasmirk: back
19-02-2021T00:17:07,ZRO4825,I like when the bad guys are hot ladies. ^_^
19-02-2021T00:17:08,KeefMcDerpface,wb
19-02-2021T00:17:11,CrRAR,wb
19-02-2021T00:17:39,Roughlandin,"It just linked to a google search for the term ""Goodnight Tom! Thanks for streaming!"" lol"
19-02-2021T00:17:52,RevGaming,what were he results?
19-02-2021T00:18:12,Roughlandin,"""We're sorry. We couldn't find exactly what you were looking for."""
19-02-2021T00:18:21,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-laugh:
19-02-2021T00:18:26,ShamusTheFox,Spider kinda reminds me of the mechs from Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex
19-02-2021T00:18:32,SpazztasticKiwi,i guess google can’t find Tom
19-02-2021T00:18:38,Dadrobit,"We spoke for a while, he liked the idea, (and was greatly amused at your intentions) but ultimately it came down to monetization."
19-02-2021T00:18:54,Dadrobit,"Also, sorry for delayed responses, work is steady tonight."
19-02-2021T00:19:18,SpazztasticKiwi,steady flo can be a pest
19-02-2021T00:19:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I know the pain
19-02-2021T00:19:25,SageSaga,np - it would be awesome if the museum could offer like a collection of the instruments online for samples
19-02-2021T00:19:31,SageSaga,and sold of course
19-02-2021T00:19:57,RevGaming,One of the animes that stick out in my mind from High Shool is FMA
19-02-2021T00:20:01,SageSaga,only down side is - i probably couldnt afford it all then XD but yeah- i think they should do that
19-02-2021T00:20:40,Dadrobit,"He told me to come back when I was a teacher at the college and we could work something out, but me personally using recordings of their instruments for money would potentially lead to legal issues."
19-02-2021T00:21:00,ShamusTheFox,"Oof, yeah."
19-02-2021T00:21:15,Ordithus,darn law getting in the way of a good time
19-02-2021T00:21:31,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-kingtea:
19-02-2021T00:21:49,Dadrobit,Crossing my fingers I can start working as a TA at the college next semester.
19-02-2021T00:21:49,Roughlandin,Yeah sounds like something Jade would say lol
19-02-2021T00:21:54,SageSaga,oh because a lot of them are instruments that have been donated right?
19-02-2021T00:21:59,CrRAR,hehe
19-02-2021T00:22:27,Roughlandin,Is the museum a nonprofit?
19-02-2021T00:22:29,Dadrobit,"Among other aspects, yes that was a big one as well."
19-02-2021T00:22:57,SageSaga,non-profits can still sell things
19-02-2021T00:23:05,SageSaga,and make a lot of money...
19-02-2021T00:23:31,SageSaga,they just need to spend that money back into the non-profit or donate it
19-02-2021T00:23:38,CrRAR,"yeah, non-profit basically only means that they planned out already how they intend to spend their money"
19-02-2021T00:23:39,Roughlandin,True
19-02-2021T00:23:48,ShamusTheFox,Yep. And keep a proper accounting of everything.
19-02-2021T00:23:56,Dadrobit,"Yes, it's a non profit."
19-02-2021T00:24:41,Dadrobit,"He was cool with the idea of donating the audio to the school for use as a teaching aid in sound design and music production though, so hopefully one day..."
19-02-2021T00:25:42,Dadrobit,"Until then, I gotta look somewhere else for sources...."
19-02-2021T00:25:48,SageSaga,i wish i was rich so i could just hire musicians with these musical instruments to record samplings for use-
19-02-2021T00:26:02,ZRO4825,What do you need?
19-02-2021T00:26:24,Dadrobit,"Harp, dulcimer, pipe flute, and something else I forget atm"
19-02-2021T00:26:32,SageSaga,"lute, panflute, viol, dulcimer, harp-"
19-02-2021T00:26:35,ZRO4825,:thinking:  Might have them on a keyboard.
19-02-2021T00:26:39,SageSaga,no
19-02-2021T00:26:47,ZRO4825,No?
19-02-2021T00:26:59,SageSaga,synth harps are kinda common on a keyboard- and they suck
19-02-2021T00:26:59,SpazztasticKiwi,*crunches loudly on chips*
19-02-2021T00:27:06,Roughlandin,Yum chips
19-02-2021T00:27:10,ShamusTheFox,Very period instruments
19-02-2021T00:27:10,CrRAR,delicious
19-02-2021T00:27:14,Dadrobit,I was looking to get live recording samples for them all.
19-02-2021T00:27:54,ShamusTheFox,There aren't stock sound bytes for use on the net?
19-02-2021T00:27:56,ZRO4825,"I know a number of musicians, so I *might* be able to get access to them. I'd like skill though."
19-02-2021T00:27:58,SageSaga,if we had samples of them all we could plug em in to DAWs and make music with em and change em up however we want
19-02-2021T00:28:12,ZRO4825,I'd lack*
19-02-2021T00:28:44,SageSaga,Robit- do you know the process of getting all the required notes and chords for sampling?
19-02-2021T00:28:55,Ordithus,:ptv-sleepy: so tired
19-02-2021T00:28:58,Ordithus,but stream
19-02-2021T00:29:01,SageSaga,im curious how difficult it is- or if theres a way to do it with less
19-02-2021T00:29:13,Dadrobit,"Shamus, yeah, some. Most are either trash recordings, or they're like little riffs without clean individual notes"
19-02-2021T00:29:36,Roughlandin,Blargh. Same Ord. Lotta schoolwork this week.:/
19-02-2021T00:29:44,ShamusTheFox,"I'm going to cut out for the night, but it's been a good time, y'all."
19-02-2021T00:29:54,Roughlandin,Night Shamus
19-02-2021T00:29:56,Ordithus,night shamus
19-02-2021T00:29:57,KeefMcDerpface,night Shamus
19-02-2021T00:30:02,CrRAR,:v: shamus
19-02-2021T00:30:26,Dadrobit,"Yeah, you don't need a lot. Just one clean note is the minimum. Best to get a few samples though. Like a staccato pluck and legato pluck. And get the with different dynamics."
19-02-2021T00:30:31,Ordithus,day 1 of weaning off caffeine. it's been rough
19-02-2021T00:30:38,Dadrobit,Them*
19-02-2021T00:30:43,Roughlandin,That does sound me
19-02-2021T00:30:50,Roughlandin,:bear:
19-02-2021T00:30:52,Dadrobit,"Ord, you can do it. I'm at a month and a half clean"
19-02-2021T00:31:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I might join the early bedtime train
19-02-2021T00:31:19,SageSaga,if there's a formula like - a list of things you would need to make a usable sample from an instrument- could you do that?
19-02-2021T00:31:25,Dadrobit,Night to everyone that's heading out!
19-02-2021T00:31:53,CrRAR,ok spazz
19-02-2021T00:32:06,Dadrobit,A 440
19-02-2021T00:32:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve been super tired
19-02-2021T00:32:29,SageSaga,A 440?
19-02-2021T00:32:33,SpazztasticKiwi,two of the days we were snowed in I slept over 12 hours
19-02-2021T00:32:41,SpazztasticKiwi,still tired
19-02-2021T00:32:43,Ordithus,wow
19-02-2021T00:32:46,CrRAR,yeah the long days catch up
19-02-2021T00:33:02,Ordithus,"oversleep. it's weird, it makes you tired"
19-02-2021T00:33:04,SpazztasticKiwi,last night I got a whole 5 hours
19-02-2021T00:33:14,Ordithus,or that
19-02-2021T00:33:20,SageSaga,thats all you need Robit?
19-02-2021T00:33:21,CrRAR,whoowee
19-02-2021T00:33:35,Roughlandin,I feel that. My sleep schedule is all out of whack. I woke up at like 6am today lol
19-02-2021T00:33:47,Dadrobit,It's A above middle C. It's exactly 440 hertz. Bare minimum is that note. But you would want variations on how it is played to make it a good sample pack.
19-02-2021T00:34:03,Ordithus,more data better
19-02-2021T00:34:19,SageSaga,so- you would just need that one note- done in different ways for a clean sample to convert?
19-02-2021T00:34:26,SpazztasticKiwi,and I got woke up an hour before my alarm so it was more like 4 hours plus a short nap where I almost fell back asleep before my alarm finally  went off
19-02-2021T00:34:49,SageSaga,thats- thats actually way easier than i thought it would be- i thought you would need each note-
19-02-2021T00:35:11,Dadrobit,"And needless to say, it needs to be a very clean recording, no background noise and the absolute minimum of reverb/echo."
19-02-2021T00:35:14,Roughlandin,Ugh getting woken up from almost sleeping is the worst
19-02-2021T00:35:23,CrRAR,"I miss those days where waking up before your alarm is kinda a relief cuz you could be like, ""oh, I still have time to lay here and just rest"""
19-02-2021T00:35:33,CrRAR,but 5 hours is not enough to feel that
19-02-2021T00:35:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve been walking that “very close to random maniacal  laughter fit” line
19-02-2021T00:35:50,Ordithus,oooh fun!
19-02-2021T00:35:56,Dadrobit,"Nope, the function of a sampler is to cleanly transpose that note into different notes."
19-02-2021T00:36:03,CrRAR,oh no the hysterical delirium
19-02-2021T00:36:08,CrRAR,:ptv-confused:
19-02-2021T00:36:12,SpazztasticKiwi,especially after these customers I had
19-02-2021T00:36:21,Dadrobit,Then you midi that bad boy into whatever song you want it for.
19-02-2021T00:36:23,CrRAR,right
19-02-2021T00:36:49,Roughlandin,How spazz felt today: https://www.patreon.com/posts/manic-kat-39037091
19-02-2021T00:36:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I had a man come up to the counter - just to stand and smile - as I explained how to filter the fryer to the other worker
19-02-2021T00:37:07,CrRAR,"keep on the same path, boom, supervillain before you know it"
19-02-2021T00:37:11,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-clovischuckle:
19-02-2021T00:37:15,Dadrobit,"For a harp specifically, you might also want to record some different runs, but yeah, that's about it."
19-02-2021T00:37:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I stopped talking and she goes over with “how can I help you” & the guys like “oh I was just listening to her”
19-02-2021T00:37:29,SpazztasticKiwi,continues standing and smiling
19-02-2021T00:37:36,CrRAR,wow
19-02-2021T00:37:39,Ordithus,yeah a harp would give all different harmonics depending which string is plucked
19-02-2021T00:37:42,SpazztasticKiwi,then walks off when I go back to the back
19-02-2021T00:37:52,CrRAR,"""ooookayyyy"""
19-02-2021T00:37:55,Ordithus,creeeeeeepy
19-02-2021T00:37:56,Roughlandin,Clean up on aisle creep
19-02-2021T00:37:57,SageSaga,so- even if you dont know how to play any of these- if you can hit that note and do it in the different methods- you can use it
19-02-2021T00:38:27,SpazztasticKiwi,pinball machine of ❓❓❓ happened in my head
19-02-2021T00:38:31,Dadrobit,"If you can play the piano, you can play anything that's been sampled."
19-02-2021T00:39:01,CrRAR,the honesty is probably the most unsettling
19-02-2021T00:39:51,SpazztasticKiwi,the other girl was like “did you know him?” because I was about to try going out to break & she thought he was here to meet me
19-02-2021T00:40:02,SpazztasticKiwi,“nope never seen him before”
19-02-2021T00:40:29,SpazztasticKiwi,so then we were both hella confused
19-02-2021T00:40:35,Dadrobit,"Even if you can't play piano, you can still paint in midi with your mouse of course!"
19-02-2021T00:40:43,Roughlandin,I was about to ask if this was the same guy who said he was watching you and knew what kind of car you drove
19-02-2021T00:40:52,SpazztasticKiwi,different guy
19-02-2021T00:40:59,SpazztasticKiwi,unfortunately
19-02-2021T00:41:01,Roughlandin,A colony of creeps
19-02-2021T00:41:16,SageSaga,how about creating midis from vocals?
19-02-2021T00:41:20,SpazztasticKiwi,you meet all kinds working retail
19-02-2021T00:41:43,SpazztasticKiwi,you meet even more as a woman in retail
19-02-2021T00:41:45,Roughlandin,Most of the weird people I met in retail just threatened me with violence
19-02-2021T00:41:45,Ordithus,you can make a midi of a car alarm if you want
19-02-2021T00:41:47,Dadrobit,That's.... Not a technology I have access to.
19-02-2021T00:42:28,SageSaga,really Robit? I thought most DAWs can manage it?
19-02-2021T00:42:54,SageSaga,though im still not sure was DAW stands for - Digital Audio- wavelength?
19-02-2021T00:43:12,Dadrobit,"I mean, I have autotune, (off brand of course) and so I could sing and read the midi from that, but that's $$$$"
19-02-2021T00:43:24,Dadrobit,Digital Audio Workstation
19-02-2021T00:44:40,SageSaga,i thought i found some plugins that let things like reaper do it-
19-02-2021T00:44:42,Dadrobit,Maybe it's a thing that I don't know about? I've always been a mouse painter.
19-02-2021T00:44:58,SpazztasticKiwi,you ever make a guess what’s gonna happen in a show and then it turns out what happens is way way worse
19-02-2021T00:44:59,SageSaga,i know there is a microphone with software that lets you do it
19-02-2021T00:45:03,SageSaga,but thats 300 bucks
19-02-2021T00:45:38,SageSaga,im pretty certain though you should be able to make midis from just about any audio source-
19-02-2021T00:46:07,CrRAR,prediction skills :ok_hand:
19-02-2021T00:46:11,Roughlandin,"I stopped guessing about shows after GoT's last season, Kiwi"
19-02-2021T00:46:42,Ordithus,I have a cheap old casio keyboard that has midi of an f1 car for goodness sake
19-02-2021T00:46:45,Ordithus,it's hilarious
19-02-2021T00:47:06,SageSaga,my vocal range and general singing ability is much better than my keyboard playing though
19-02-2021T00:47:42,Dadrobit,"Yeah, thinking about the weird midi recordings I've seen on YouTube, there's definitely something out there. I'm just not personally familiar with what it is."
19-02-2021T00:47:53,SpazztasticKiwi,welp this one I thought the big secret they were keeping from the now adult youngest kid was that he was adopted
19-02-2021T00:47:55,SpazztasticKiwi,nope
19-02-2021T00:48:39,Roughlandin,"I have several worse guesses where this twist could go, Kiwi"
19-02-2021T00:48:44,SpazztasticKiwi,the family secret is that they had another son - a kid between this youngest son and the firstborn daughter
19-02-2021T00:48:57,SpazztasticKiwi,this middle child died at 7
19-02-2021T00:49:06,SpazztasticKiwi,when the youngest was born
19-02-2021T00:49:55,Roughlandin,So they named the youngest kid the same as the middle kid and pretended the middle kid never died?
19-02-2021T00:50:01,Dadrobit,"Mmmm, found one site that converts mp3 to midi, but it's one of those sites where half the ""ads"" look like functions of the site."
19-02-2021T00:50:17,SpazztasticKiwi,they kept the existence of the middle boy secret from the youngest
19-02-2021T00:50:45,Roughlandin,Ah. This sounds familiar. What show is this?
19-02-2021T00:50:47,SpazztasticKiwi,but they were distant from both surviving children after the middle one died
19-02-2021T00:51:04,KeefMcDerpface,\o Night all. :ptv-sleepy:
19-02-2021T00:51:11,Dadrobit,o/ keef
19-02-2021T00:51:11,Roughlandin,Night keef!
19-02-2021T00:51:14,Ordithus,night keef
19-02-2021T00:51:22,SpazztasticKiwi,cancer killed the boy & it seems like it sorta broke the parents
19-02-2021T00:51:29,SpazztasticKiwi,911
19-02-2021T00:52:06,Roughlandin,Ah okay. Not the show I was thinking of but thanks
19-02-2021T00:53:26,SpazztasticKiwi,it comes up when the living son has gotten to where he feels ostracized from the family - the oldest has a baby box but he doesn’t (probably because they stopped doing those after the second kid died)
19-02-2021T00:54:08,SpazztasticKiwi,it starts to look like they love the first born more than him
19-02-2021T00:54:18,Roughlandin,Oof
19-02-2021T00:54:37,Dadrobit,"Brb, work is working me"
19-02-2021T00:54:44,CrRAR,okay
19-02-2021T00:54:49,SpazztasticKiwi,but in reality the parents distanced themselves from both kids after the middle died
19-02-2021T00:55:11,CrRAR,aww
19-02-2021T00:55:24,SpazztasticKiwi,and decided it was “for the best” not to tell this guy he’d had a brother
19-02-2021T00:56:04,SpazztasticKiwi,he’s only learning of this as a grown man in his 20d
19-02-2021T00:56:07,SpazztasticKiwi,20s
19-02-2021T00:56:12,Roughlandin,"Yeesh. I get people process stuff differently, but that sounds... pretty damaging to grow up with"
19-02-2021T00:56:55,CrRAR,This is just reminding me of that movie Manchester-by-the-sea

19-02-2021T01:00:02,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s a garbage thing to do to a kid
19-02-2021T01:00:25,SpazztasticKiwi,even if he was a baby when his brother died it’s not right to act like he never existed
19-02-2021T01:08:51,FoxxTrotter,"I'm off to bed. G'night, everyone. :0)"

19-02-2021T01:14:23,SageSaga,dinner is what you eat when you are hungry and its later in the day

19-02-2021T13:24:00,SpazztasticKiwi,🥤
19-02-2021T13:29:58,AspiringNoodle,I should join you Ord
19-02-2021T13:30:09,AspiringNoodle,Caffeine is so overused these days...
19-02-2021T13:38:22,Ordithus,"it was doing something to me thursday, so I cut it off"
19-02-2021T13:38:26,Ordithus,yesterday sucked
19-02-2021T13:54:35,AspiringNoodle,I wonder if caffeine will ever be regulated
19-02-2021T14:00:09,Ordithus,the great coffee prohibition of 2021
19-02-2021T14:00:18,Ordithus,the world would descend into chaos
19-02-2021T14:00:21,Ordithus,and sleep
19-02-2021T14:08:18,AspiringNoodle,"Uh, not so much coffee, haha"
19-02-2021T14:08:25,AspiringNoodle,Have you seen how many sodas have caffeine in them?
19-02-2021T14:08:41,AspiringNoodle,I swear this one brand I like puts caffeine in their GRAPE
19-02-2021T14:08:57,Ordithus,"Oh yeah. Yeah, caffeine should not be in anything marketed at kids."
19-02-2021T14:09:38,Ordithus,The amount in a mountain dew is a bit much
19-02-2021T14:11:03,AspiringNoodle,Coffee gets the obligatory free pass because it's *the* caffeinated drink
19-02-2021T14:11:18,AspiringNoodle,Energy drinks also get the same pass because they're marketed / consumed for such a purpose
19-02-2021T14:11:36,Ordithus,don't forget tea
19-02-2021T14:11:49,AspiringNoodle,"Tea has some caffeine, but nowhere near coffee levels"
19-02-2021T14:11:58,AspiringNoodle,"Heck, I think it's well below par for caffeinated sodas, too"
19-02-2021T14:22:31,TerraTheWizard,you can get decaff tea too
19-02-2021T14:22:42,TerraTheWizard,"though it's usually sold as ""bedtime brew"" or something similar"
19-02-2021T14:23:47,Ordithus,I've got some herbal teas
19-02-2021T14:44:08,AspiringNoodle,Random tangent
