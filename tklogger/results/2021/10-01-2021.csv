10-01-2021T00:07:00,SpazztasticKiwi,does frosty the swoleman look like he’s screaming inside to anyone else
10-01-2021T00:07:24,Roughlandin,Would Trace know that halfkinds are weird in Mekkan?
10-01-2021T00:07:59,SpaceCadety,"Given that he knows hybrids are supposed to be impossible, yes."
10-01-2021T00:07:59,Twokinds,I wonder how many km of lines I've drawn in all my time as an artist.
10-01-2021T00:08:10,Roughlandin,Enough to go to the moon!
10-01-2021T00:08:19,InTheLionsDen,A considerable amount.
10-01-2021T00:08:19,Roughlandin,Bam! Pow!
10-01-2021T00:08:46,SpaceCadety,probably enough to go around the world.
10-01-2021T00:09:19,SpaceCadety,depending on how you measure.
10-01-2021T00:10:10,Roughlandin,"Kiwi, if I was stuck looking at her and completely unable to nervously whimper ""h-hi"" like a total Simp, I'd be screaming inside too."

10-01-2021T00:13:28,Roughlandin,His sketches from near the end show his slow descent into madness
10-01-2021T00:16:43,CrimsonHelsing,Amazingly he's only gotten better and better
10-01-2021T00:17:41,KeefMcDerpface,yep
10-01-2021T00:18:19,SpazztasticKiwi,rough that brings to attention that you must not get out
10-01-2021T00:18:27,SpazztasticKiwi,and that you should more
10-01-2021T00:18:40,Roughlandin,I get out... I just live in the woods

10-01-2021T00:22:32,SpaceCadety,"We haven't seen Raine and Kathrin interact on panel in the comic have we?  I think that'd be kinda interesting, the most bookish of each group."
10-01-2021T00:23:04,Roughlandin,Kat has yet to meet any of Team B except Zen
10-01-2021T00:23:08,KeefMcDerpface,Kat has mostly been with Zen for the most part.
10-01-2021T00:23:22,InTheLionsDen,"Kathrin was reading some of Raine's fanfics, I believe."
10-01-2021T00:23:31,KeefMcDerpface,"Oh, yeah"
10-01-2021T00:23:32,steelabjur,In the comic? Don't think so. They may have been together in the book club sketch though...
10-01-2021T00:23:40,KeefMcDerpface,"But that was sketch, not in comic."
10-01-2021T00:23:54,SpaceCadety,"They've definitely talked off panel, about Zen"
10-01-2021T00:24:05,Roughlandin,It's weird how many characters have never actually interacted in the comic
10-01-2021T00:24:17,InTheLionsDen,That we have seen
10-01-2021T00:24:39,Ordithus,all things are canon:tm:
10-01-2021T00:24:42,KeefMcDerpface,"Hmm, yeah, come to think of it, when Zen comes to, Kat talks about how Raine came into the room for an update on Zen."
10-01-2021T00:25:05,Roughlandin,Oh yeah
10-01-2021T00:25:12,KeefMcDerpface,And there was the pillows...

10-01-2021T00:26:26,Roughlandin,"That sounds like a story, Kiwi"
10-01-2021T00:27:13,SpaceCadety,Sounds like a bad idea avoided.
10-01-2021T00:27:24,SpazztasticKiwi,bored and lonely & I saw he was online so I had a smol part inside suggest starting a conversation
10-01-2021T00:27:37,SpazztasticKiwi,then my common sense heard & beat it back into its cage
10-01-2021T00:27:53,Roughlandin,Yeaaaaah. Probably for the best
10-01-2021T00:29:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"it hasn’t escaped my notice that the day his mom messaged me for the random catch up, it was his birthday"
10-01-2021T00:29:50,KeefMcDerpface,oh...
10-01-2021T00:30:23,Roughlandin,Hmm...
10-01-2021T00:30:26,Roughlandin,HMMM
10-01-2021T00:30:42,Roughlandin,Wonder WHAT he could want
10-01-2021T00:30:49,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s a mighty hard hmmmmm there rough
10-01-2021T00:31:17,Roughlandin,My bear nose smells a mystery!
10-01-2021T00:31:30,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s not like he’s bad
10-01-2021T00:31:34,Ordithus,sometimes exes can be good friends. no idea how you two were
10-01-2021T00:32:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"it’s just after 5 years of s i l e n c e, where do you start talking again and why"
10-01-2021T00:32:26,Ordithus,yeaah that's hard to figure out. awkward galore?
10-01-2021T00:32:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I did message him awhile back that a family member of his had friended me and I suspected it wasn’t actually them but I never got a response so I reported it and moved on
10-01-2021T00:33:25,Roughlandin,"Eh. Don't know you're situation, but a round of ""sorries"" couldn't hurt after 5 years apart"
10-01-2021T00:33:31,Roughlandin,*your
10-01-2021T00:33:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"and then however long later he responds with this like he was just getting the message, which is possible"
10-01-2021T00:33:41,TheSexyBeast,"Shoot, drifted off to sleep. I'll need to catch the replay"
10-01-2021T00:34:04,SpazztasticKiwi,sorries don’t apply as far as I know
10-01-2021T00:34:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"not as long as it’s been, and I’m the one that broke it off"
10-01-2021T00:35:14,Roughlandin,"You can tell I have a lot of experience with this stuff, right?"
10-01-2021T00:35:27,Roughlandin,(The joke is I don't.)
10-01-2021T00:35:49,SpazztasticKiwi,we didn’t break off gracefully but the flames did extinguish after awhile between the family members
10-01-2021T00:36:49,TheSexyBeast,"Kiwi, I'm there as well. My ex told me that she didn't think she wanted to be with me anymore, so I packed my things up and left."
10-01-2021T00:37:18,Roughlandin,Sometimes stuff just doesn't work
10-01-2021T00:37:28,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s not that I wanted to leave at the time - I liked him
10-01-2021T00:37:45,Roughlandin,Re: Sometimes stuff just doesn't work
10-01-2021T00:37:56,TheSexyBeast,It's been hard mostly because I haven't found someone new to fill the void.
10-01-2021T00:38:10,TheSexyBeast,"Exactly, Rough"
10-01-2021T00:38:16,SpazztasticKiwi,but my mom didn’t & I’m not sure if some of his family was keen on it either
10-01-2021T00:38:59,TheSexyBeast,"It's your life to live, no one else's."
10-01-2021T00:39:11,Roughlandin,Yeah sounds like a big dose of not their business
10-01-2021T00:40:01,TheSexyBeast,"When you become of legal age, your life is your own."
10-01-2021T00:40:31,SpazztasticKiwi,well long story short a big mess happened senior prom night & I decided I was done with the fits between everyone that had their noses in a pot that wasn’t theirs
10-01-2021T00:40:54,Ordithus,that sucks
10-01-2021T00:40:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"told him we’d be better off apart, more or less"
10-01-2021T00:41:11,TheSexyBeast,Good deal
10-01-2021T00:41:25,SpazztasticKiwi,but it was his grandma that had called my mom cussing her out for trying to call his mom to ask why he hadn’t worn a suit
10-01-2021T00:41:28,SpazztasticKiwi,that was it
10-01-2021T00:41:36,SpazztasticKiwi,wear a suit for prom
10-01-2021T00:41:41,Ordithus,"like a real life romeo and juliet, but the happy ending where nobody dies"
10-01-2021T00:42:11,Roughlandin,"Two families, both alike in drama"
10-01-2021T00:42:19,TheSexyBeast,Senior prom = grade 12?
10-01-2021T00:42:24,Roughlandin,Yeah
10-01-2021T00:43:16,TheSexyBeast,"I have unsolicited advice if you're interested, Kiwi"
10-01-2021T00:43:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t care
10-01-2021T00:44:00,TheSexyBeast,Fair enough.
10-01-2021T00:44:15,SpazztasticKiwi,share or not
10-01-2021T00:44:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I talk about it alot but it’s just a story to tell at this point
10-01-2021T00:45:05,TheSexyBeast,"No, it's not right for me to push it on you."
10-01-2021T00:45:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d told him he didn’t have to go if he didn’t want to & I may have wanted him to but his logic was “if I don’t go you’ll be mad”
10-01-2021T00:45:36,TheSexyBeast,"Just know that you made a good choice, IMO."
10-01-2021T00:45:37,Ordithus,blegh something I ate or drank today does not like me

10-01-2021T00:50:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"we dated for 5 years & with how we ended up apart, it definitely would’ve ended but if we’d stayed together..."
10-01-2021T00:51:10,TheSexyBeast,"If you stayed together, you'd both be miserable."
10-01-2021T00:51:22,Roughlandin,Eh who knows. Thus is life
10-01-2021T00:51:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I was more reserved then but I most definitely had and have a temper
10-01-2021T00:51:50,Roughlandin,...I'mma hold my tongue
10-01-2021T00:51:57,Roughlandin,*blem*
10-01-2021T00:52:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I helped at the church often
10-01-2021T00:52:36,TheSexyBeast,Something something youth and a learning experience had
10-01-2021T00:52:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"I was part of the youth choir and theater group if that’s what you want to call it so I didn’t have much of a choice really, to help with events"
10-01-2021T00:53:43,TheSexyBeast,Do you still?
10-01-2021T00:53:50,SpazztasticKiwi,that’s where we met & he was over one day we were setting up for one & I don’t remember what it was or how it started but there was a light bickering going on
10-01-2021T00:53:54,SpazztasticKiwi,nope
10-01-2021T00:54:27,Roughlandin,Light bickering? Classic kiwi bait
10-01-2021T00:54:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’m generally mild when I argue, and it was either that or the argument but he turned off & went to go outside for whatever reason"
10-01-2021T00:55:01,SpazztasticKiwi,and he punched a pew on the way out
10-01-2021T00:55:31,Roughlandin,No! What if jesus was sitting there?!
10-01-2021T00:55:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"so I stood, and said very evenly but loud enough to hear that if that’s how he wanted to act he could leave and not come back"
10-01-2021T00:55:40,TheSexyBeast,"Is he autistic, by chance?"
10-01-2021T00:55:45,KeefMcDerpface,*Jesus will remember that.*
10-01-2021T00:55:50,Roughlandin,lol keef
10-01-2021T00:55:59,Roughlandin,He'll just turn the other cheek
10-01-2021T00:56:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I was in the main area of course with him alone setting up my laptop for the projector & the rest of the crew was a door away in the kitchen/dining area
10-01-2021T00:57:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I put what I was working on down and went in there with them & everyone obviously knew something was up because they moved out of my way
10-01-2021T00:57:32,Roughlandin,Run. RUN!
10-01-2021T00:57:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"and sure enough, he was close behind me"
10-01-2021T00:57:44,Roughlandin,Fite?
10-01-2021T00:58:04,TheSexyBeast,"Kiwi, cut yourself some slack. You were both young."
10-01-2021T00:58:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I started helping the director put up his decor he was working on and just gave him the cold shoulder
10-01-2021T00:58:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"I wasn’t being unreasonable, though you could say I was being rude or mean"
10-01-2021T00:58:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I was staying quiet to return to the discussion when he wasn’t punching things
10-01-2021T00:59:15,KeefMcDerpface,How many things did he punch?
10-01-2021T00:59:18,KeefMcDerpface,Everything?!
10-01-2021T00:59:22,Roughlandin,That's how men discuss things
10-01-2021T00:59:33,Roughlandin,Then we go get a snack
10-01-2021T00:59:48,SpazztasticKiwi,and yes he has aspergers
10-01-2021T00:59:50,Ordithus,"rough that's bears, not men"
10-01-2021T00:59:53,TheSexyBeast,"I have to go, everyone have a good night/day"

10-01-2021T01:00:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"if you think throwing or punching shit will get you anywhere with me, it’ll get you sent out the door on your ass"
10-01-2021T01:01:27,Roughlandin,Punching things is no good. I'm actually a very nonconfrontational bear irl
10-01-2021T01:01:35,Roughlandin,...Except for the bear part
10-01-2021T01:02:02,Roughlandin,But yeah. Punching things bad. Abusive drunks suck
10-01-2021T01:02:33,Roughlandin,My best friend had an emotionally abusive drunkard of a dad and he messed her up for years
10-01-2021T01:02:59,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-shock:
10-01-2021T01:03:20,Roughlandin,He also spent all of our high school trying to get a seperation from her so he didn't have to pay child support any more
10-01-2021T01:03:38,Roughlandin,I didn't know you could divorce your kids before that
10-01-2021T01:04:07,Ordithus,just how does someone drop to that level
10-01-2021T01:04:15,Roughlandin,He was a real piece of shit
10-01-2021T01:05:29,Roughlandin,"So was this how you started dating or how you broke up, Kiwi?"
10-01-2021T01:05:53,SpazztasticKiwi,that was an instance in the middle of dating
10-01-2021T01:05:56,Roughlandin,Ah
10-01-2021T01:06:30,CorporalAxolotl,Who's still here even lol
10-01-2021T01:06:33,Roughlandin,"Well either way, punching stuff is no good"
10-01-2021T01:06:35,Roughlandin,We are
10-01-2021T01:06:44,CorporalAxolotl,how do you make money
10-01-2021T01:06:44,Roughlandin,Are we not entertaining lol?
10-01-2021T01:06:51,Ordithus,you work
10-01-2021T01:06:51,Roughlandin,"Uh, that's a question"
10-01-2021T01:06:55,CorporalAxolotl,you have so much free time
10-01-2021T01:07:00,Roughlandin,Okay
10-01-2021T01:07:03,Roughlandin,Kinda rude
10-01-2021T01:07:07,KeefMcDerpface,yeah...
10-01-2021T01:07:28,KeefMcDerpface,There's a thing called days off of work...
10-01-2021T01:07:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I work then I come here
10-01-2021T01:07:44,SpazztasticKiwi,then I pop in on break & lunch
10-01-2021T01:08:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"& on days off, I peekaboo"
10-01-2021T01:08:32,Roughlandin,Tom runs his chat basically as an open forum. People are here pretty much 24/7
10-01-2021T01:09:03,KeefMcDerpface,^
10-01-2021T01:09:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"as I’ve read, punching walls & breaking stuff and the raising voice are the beginnings of abuse"
10-01-2021T01:10:13,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s considered domestic abuse at that point even if they’re not hitting or making contact with you - it’s intimidation
10-01-2021T01:10:21,KeefMcDerpface,Glad I no longer do that and found ways to calm down.
10-01-2021T01:11:10,Roughlandin,How old was he? Not making excuses but teenage boys are basically 75% testosterone and 25% gross skin oils
10-01-2021T01:11:13,SpazztasticKiwi,if there’s an argument some folks let off steam by hitting the gym for a bit or walking while others just walk off
10-01-2021T01:11:40,SpazztasticKiwi,we dated 13/14-18
10-01-2021T01:12:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I was a few days older
10-01-2021T01:12:27,Roughlandin,I blow off steam by pretending to be a bear on the internet and telling really stupid lewd jokes that nobody finds funny
10-01-2021T01:12:39,SpazztasticKiwi,people like to point out how hormonal and crazy women are too
10-01-2021T01:12:52,Roughlandin,Teenagers in general
10-01-2021T01:13:00,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s self control to consider
10-01-2021T01:13:02,Roughlandin,But still not an excuse for hitting stuff
10-01-2021T01:13:05,Roughlandin,Right
10-01-2021T01:13:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t bother entertaining somebody who’s gotten hyper
10-01-2021T01:14:04,Roughlandin,Sometimes people grow out of stuff like that. Sometimes they don't.
10-01-2021T01:14:12,SpazztasticKiwi,you can sit in a corner until you can talk like a regular human adult
10-01-2021T01:15:08,Roughlandin,Okay... *Sits in the corner and grawrs quietly to self.*
10-01-2021T01:15:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"there’s no telling how he is now - probably fine, better"
10-01-2021T01:15:31,Ordithus,hope so!
10-01-2021T01:15:42,Roughlandin,Yeah here's hoping
10-01-2021T01:16:01,Roughlandin,"But age really doesn't measure how fast people mature, if ever"
10-01-2021T01:16:18,Roughlandin,I know people who still act like they're in high school. Petty drama 24/7
10-01-2021T01:16:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"& I’m sure as for turning it on me, he’d never but you can’t actually say for sure with anyone"
10-01-2021T01:16:46,KeefMcDerpface,Freshmen in High School are... Something.
10-01-2021T01:17:23,Roughlandin,Frickin freshmen

10-01-2021T01:17:33,Roughlandin,Uh
10-01-2021T01:17:39,Roughlandin,You gotta be 18 here bud
10-01-2021T01:17:40,KeefMcDerpface,"Gosh, I remember when our school went on lock-down because of them."
10-01-2021T01:17:42,SpazztasticKiwi,his family I know would have his head because his uncle in particular is military
10-01-2021T01:17:45,Roughlandin,Go have a couple birthdays
10-01-2021T01:17:46,CorporalAxolotl,no?
10-01-2021T01:17:49,Roughlandin,Yeah
10-01-2021T01:17:58,Roughlandin,"Yeah you do, dude. Picarto rules"
10-01-2021T01:18:01,CorporalAxolotl,the comics are like 14+ or smth
10-01-2021T01:18:04,CorporalAxolotl,oh
10-01-2021T01:18:12,CorporalAxolotl,*disappears*
10-01-2021T01:18:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"if he became abusive, that is, to anyone"
10-01-2021T01:19:08,SpazztasticKiwi,said uncle got ahold of his son for saying slurs at one point
10-01-2021T01:19:19,Roughlandin,That'll do it
10-01-2021T01:19:41,Roughlandin,Learn him early
10-01-2021T01:19:54,Roughlandin,That way we don't have days like last wednesday
10-01-2021T01:19:58,Roughlandin,...Not to get topical
10-01-2021T01:20:35,KeefMcDerpface,:ptv-grossedout:
10-01-2021T01:21:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I know in unus annus Mark punched a wall
10-01-2021T01:21:24,SpazztasticKiwi,he said he wishes he didn’t
10-01-2021T01:21:28,Roughlandin,Wasn't that in the breaking stuff episode?
10-01-2021T01:21:48,Roughlandin,Where they went to that place where you can pay to break things?
10-01-2021T01:21:52,SpazztasticKiwi,it was when they first tried that fitness test
10-01-2021T01:21:58,Roughlandin,Ooooh yeah
10-01-2021T01:22:09,Ordithus,hm didn't watch that one
10-01-2021T01:22:14,Roughlandin,He was mad and I don't know how much was for the video
10-01-2021T01:22:19,Ordithus,I should oh wait
10-01-2021T01:22:24,Roughlandin,lol Ord

10-01-2021T01:22:36,KeefMcDerpface,About that Ord...
10-01-2021T01:22:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"Ethan was teasing him while he was on the bike & when he was done with the 2 miles, he stood up and blew a hole right through the plaster"
10-01-2021T01:22:57,Roughlandin,Very unMarkly of him
10-01-2021T01:23:10,Roughlandin,He usually only rages that hard at pogostuck
10-01-2021T01:23:16,SpazztasticKiwi,& then immediately cuts to him talking to Ethan about it
10-01-2021T01:23:38,Roughlandin,Well that's a healthy way to fix the problem at least
10-01-2021T01:23:39,SpazztasticKiwi,he was sorry & it was stupid...etc
10-01-2021T01:24:10,SpazztasticKiwi,the problem was Mark was so out of breath he couldn’t let Ethan know he was really legitimately annoying him
10-01-2021T01:24:16,Roughlandin,Poor Ethan
10-01-2021T01:24:31,Ordithus,Ethan is really good at being annoying
10-01-2021T01:24:58,Roughlandin,I can sympathize. As someone who is also really good at being annoying
10-01-2021T01:25:15,SpazztasticKiwi,sometimes you gotta punch something but you have to be aware of the situation and why you’re punching
10-01-2021T01:25:16,Roughlandin,Hence why Sage threatens to ban me any time I speak to him...
10-01-2021T01:25:41,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s healthy physical rage letting & unhealthy
10-01-2021T01:25:47,Roughlandin,Bad guy punch: Yes
10-01-2021T01:25:51,Roughlandin,Fren punch: No

10-01-2021T01:26:51,SpazztasticKiwi,people still like to bring up when Mark hit Ethan in the head with his foot on tour
10-01-2021T01:27:05,Roughlandin,Owie
10-01-2021T01:27:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"later in the tour, Ethan accidentally hits him back at one point tho"

10-01-2021T01:39:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark is true chaos
10-01-2021T01:40:04,SpazztasticKiwi,you never know what you’re gonna get from him
10-01-2021T01:40:18,Roughlandin,"This is why he's one of the most popular Let's players on youtube, yes haha"
10-01-2021T01:41:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m really hoping he keeps the hair long
10-01-2021T01:41:07,SpazztasticKiwi,it looks really nice on him
10-01-2021T01:41:34,SpazztasticKiwi,& he said he didn’t like the ear stud but he’s been wearing it
10-01-2021T01:42:09,Roughlandin,"Long hair Mark is at least 18% smexier, ye"
10-01-2021T01:42:15,SpazztasticKiwi,the top knot/loose bun was great for the cloak pictures

10-01-2021T01:43:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark takes good pictures
10-01-2021T01:43:45,SpazztasticKiwi,and I doubt he does all of the outfits he wears but he’s good with fashion in the pictures too
10-01-2021T01:43:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m a style person
10-01-2021T01:44:15,Roughlandin,I raise you one peak Mark face https://i.redd.it/p0r15jpxwef41.jpg
10-01-2021T01:44:31,SpazztasticKiwi,if his hair gets long enough he could do a box or french braid & make a bun
10-01-2021T01:44:36,Roughlandin,"You might not like it, but this is the face of peak male"
10-01-2021T01:44:46,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s hard to describe & I’m sure harder to imagine what I’m talking about
10-01-2021T01:45:00,Roughlandin,Like a Rose style bun?
10-01-2021T01:45:11,SpazztasticKiwi,throw it in a bin and set it on fire
10-01-2021T01:45:16,SpazztasticKiwi,not rose no
10-01-2021T01:45:27,Roughlandin,He WAS holding torches in the original pic lol
10-01-2021T01:45:53,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s a braid (actually there’s multiple braids) that sit close to the scalp & pulls all the hair into it
10-01-2021T01:46:04,KeefMcDerpface,"Thanks Rough, now I can't sleep easily."
10-01-2021T01:46:09,Roughlandin,Hehehe
10-01-2021T01:46:24,Roughlandin,Keeping people up at night are what bears are best at
10-01-2021T01:46:27,SpazztasticKiwi,you use the end of the braid & pull it into a knot like you’re tying your hair in a ponytail or bun
10-01-2021T01:46:58,SpazztasticKiwi,it would also get and keep it out of his face
10-01-2021T01:47:20,SpazztasticKiwi,which is clearly what he’s trying to do with the bun thing he’s been doing
10-01-2021T01:47:37,SpazztasticKiwi,but I doubt he’d care to do a braid if he even knew how
10-01-2021T01:47:38,Roughlandin,"After a while, you have to do SOMETHING with the excess hair"
10-01-2021T01:48:16,Roughlandin,"I'm due for an appointment with the home shears sometime soon, myself"
10-01-2021T01:48:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Seán shared a picture where hed gotten a French braid
10-01-2021T01:48:31,SpazztasticKiwi,complete with bun at the back
10-01-2021T01:48:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"again, I doubt that he did it, it was probably gab"
10-01-2021T01:48:51,Roughlandin,"Actually did a decent job last time. Shaved on the side, long on top. Though I'm beginning to look like circa 2010s skrillex when I do that"
10-01-2021T01:49:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"even a normal braid can work & if it’s tight enough, it won’t bug you for days even if you sleep in it"
10-01-2021T01:50:51,Roughlandin,I finded the Sean cut. Looks snazzy
10-01-2021T01:51:12,SpazztasticKiwi,they can both do good pictures
10-01-2021T01:51:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Ethan can too
10-01-2021T01:51:38,SpazztasticKiwi,& Ethan’s brother Andrew takes some of them

10-01-2021T01:52:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom! have you tried a braid?
10-01-2021T01:53:02,Roughlandin,"There are several fan discords, but none are official and none of them have mods as good as Ord and Teddy"

10-01-2021T02:00:41,KeefMcDerpface,"There's no guarantee on TK High being a thing but if it does, it would be funny if the girls come up to you and ask, ""Who is best girl?"" and one of your options is ""Mike, no question."""

10-01-2021T02:02:47,Roughlandin,She'd make Mike cry and have to apologize
10-01-2021T02:02:54,Roughlandin,Nobody can be mad at Mike
10-01-2021T02:03:03,Roughlandin,Except Rod. And he's a prick.

10-01-2021T14:38:01,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s supposed to rain tonight & freeze which means snow becomes water puddles & ice

10-01-2021T19:51:45,Roughlandin,"We shall roast weenies while the forest burns. Rough and Noodle, agents of chaos."
10-01-2021T19:53:17,SonOfGoku,I'll bring the marshmallows
10-01-2021T19:53:56,Dadrobit,"Rough, either get a blow dryer and a round brush, or a heat brush and round brush. Wet, brush everything left, then everything right, then everything up. Apply beard oil. Use combo of blow dryer/heat brush + round brush to comb everything straight down."
10-01-2021T19:54:06,Dadrobit,No more curly copper wires
10-01-2021T19:55:11,Roughlandin,Nice. I'll do that to the twelve hairs I can grow lol
10-01-2021T19:55:37,CrRAR,groomed to perfection
10-01-2021T19:56:19,CrRAR,"Red could also probably benefit from this knowledge, then"
10-01-2021T19:56:20,Roughlandin,I can't grow a beard to save my life. Just wiry little patches
10-01-2021T19:56:45,Ordithus,meanwhile I can't skip shaving a day
10-01-2021T19:58:03,Roughlandin,I still have to shave or else I wind up looking like a 5 year old attacked me with super glue and a rusty steel wool
10-01-2021T19:58:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve heard beard oil is good for shaving
10-01-2021T19:58:40,CrRAR,is it? I thought softening hairs makes em flopsy and harder to trim
10-01-2021T19:58:56,AspiringNoodle,I'm not sure if my facial hair is thick enough for beards / moustaches
10-01-2021T19:59:14,CrRAR,noodly hairs
10-01-2021T19:59:14,AspiringNoodle,"Part of the problem is that some of my hairs are super light in color, and they blend in with my skin"
10-01-2021T19:59:31,CrRAR,hmmm
10-01-2021T19:59:33,Roughlandin,"Sounds like we have the same problem, Noodle"
10-01-2021T19:59:35,AspiringNoodle,So what looks like a blank patch on my face might actually be a cluster of hairs you just can't see
10-01-2021T19:59:50,Ordithus,"the weird thing is I have brown hair, but red facial hair"
10-01-2021T20:00:00,CrRAR,:mag::chipmunk:
10-01-2021T20:00:09,CrRAR,huh
10-01-2021T20:00:32,Roughlandin,I have brown hair and blond face fuzz lol
10-01-2021T20:00:35,AspiringNoodle,"They might be thick enough, and dense enough, but when I can only see them by catching the light on them, it doesn't help answer the ""can I grow a beard or not"" question"
10-01-2021T20:00:56,AspiringNoodle,Brown hair with interspersed reds
10-01-2021T20:01:17,CrRAR,is your hair more toward chestnut brown ord?
10-01-2021T20:01:30,Ordithus,nope pretty dark
10-01-2021T20:01:34,CrRAR,huh
10-01-2021T20:02:05,Roughlandin,I'm light brown. If I spend a lot of time in the sun it actually starts to turn blond.
10-01-2021T20:02:20,Roughlandin,Used to do it all the time in summer as a kid
10-01-2021T20:02:29,Roughlandin,...Back when I actuallly went outside lol
10-01-2021T20:02:43,Ordithus,and my right eye is a light shade of brown while the left is dark
10-01-2021T20:03:10,Ordithus,the parts bin was close but there was some mixing
10-01-2021T20:03:38,CrRAR,"welp, chat has a phoenix and a chimera. as we've learned this blessed day"
10-01-2021T20:03:46,CrRAR,...and a bear
10-01-2021T20:03:51,Roughlandin,Bork!
10-01-2021T20:03:56,Roughlandin,:bear:
10-01-2021T20:04:09,CrRAR,This is the start to a very beautiful mythical story
10-01-2021T20:05:38,Roughlandin,Give us some instruments and you have the makings of a classic fairy tale
10-01-2021T20:05:55,Roughlandin,...Of course then we'd all probably die horrible deaths at the end.

10-01-2021T20:10:40,CrRAR,Rough I feel like the characters with the mystical instruments are the ones to survive
10-01-2021T20:10:54,CrRAR,someone gotta lament the deaths of the rest

10-01-2021T20:23:43,Roughlandin,Nobody here but us woodland critters. Bork bork! Woof!
10-01-2021T20:25:09,Roughlandin,The good news is I can grow all the hair I want on the rest of my body. Just... not my face.
