01-03-2021T02:22:57,Twokinds,I suppose Nora could have her own style of butterflies

01-03-2021T05:22:14,Dadrobit,Now what am I to do?
01-03-2021T05:22:27,unsteddyphoenix,My life is now empty
01-03-2021T05:22:34,Dadrobit,That's a mood
01-03-2021T05:22:38,Twokinds,Supervise that security
01-03-2021T05:22:41,TeapotOfDoom,nooo night w0lff
01-03-2021T05:22:52,Dadrobit,"Pfft, half my cameras don't even work."
01-03-2021T05:23:15,Dadrobit,"""Top dollar, no expenses spared post!"""
01-03-2021T05:23:53,Dadrobit,98% of my job is just fielding phone calls from concerned residents.
01-03-2021T05:24:15,Dadrobit,90% of those calls are because of javelinas
01-03-2021T05:24:34,Dadrobit,It's not exactly a difficult gig.
01-03-2021T05:25:07,unsteddyphoenix,javelina?
01-03-2021T05:25:19,Dadrobit,"Cept that one time I got in a fight, that sucked."
01-03-2021T05:25:36,Dadrobit,"Wild pig, nasty tusks, smell em before eyou see em."
01-03-2021T05:25:53,unsteddyphoenix,"woah, sounds scary"
01-03-2021T05:26:55,Dadrobit,They can be. They fucked up one guard a few years back. Guy tried to scare em off on foot. They knocked him over and fucked up one of his arms real bad.
01-03-2021T05:28:00,Dadrobit,Usually use one of the late trucks to scare em off.
01-03-2021T05:28:08,Dadrobit,Patrol trucks*
01-03-2021T05:28:54,Dadrobit,The cleaning ladies he was trying to save in the first place ended up saving him.
01-03-2021T05:31:08,unsteddyphoenix,haha
01-03-2021T05:31:11,unsteddyphoenix,howd she do that
01-03-2021T05:31:48,Dadrobit,There were 4 cleaning ladies. They ran up and drug him into a maintenance shed and called for an ambulance.
01-03-2021T05:32:17,unsteddyphoenix,Did he scare it off at least?
01-03-2021T05:32:43,Dadrobit,The guy had no business even trying on foot tbh. No idea what he was thinking. He's kinda feeble and has a crazy limp.
01-03-2021T05:33:02,Dadrobit,"The ladies scared off the pack, yeah."
01-03-2021T05:33:22,Dadrobit,"He's a good guy, just a little slow."
01-03-2021T05:33:48,unsteddyphoenix,at nice
01-03-2021T05:33:56,unsteddyphoenix,at least he tried!
01-03-2021T05:34:03,Dadrobit,"I actually genuinely have no idea what condition he has mentally. You can hold a conversation with him about anything, but there's like... A delay."
01-03-2021T05:35:10,Dadrobit,Around 2-3 seconds before every statement he just buffers. It's like holding a conversation with someone on the other side of the planet.
01-03-2021T05:36:15,Dadrobit,"Kinda wonder how he got his driver's license, ngl."
01-03-2021T05:37:15,Dadrobit,"You know the sloths from Zootopia? That, almost exactly. Thought when he starts speaking, he usually is a bit faster."
01-03-2021T05:37:22,Dadrobit,Though*
01-03-2021T05:37:58,Dadrobit,"Right down to the delayed laughter, it uncanny sometimes chatting with him."
01-03-2021T05:52:38,unsteddyphoenix,Does he ever consume caffine
01-03-2021T05:56:09,Dadrobit,"Yeah, he drinks Monsters and Coffee."
01-03-2021T05:57:48,Dadrobit,"And again, he's not dumb by any metric. Just literally slow. (And yes, he is self aware, he jokes about it himself)"
01-03-2021T05:58:22,Dadrobit,"I mean, charging a pack of javelinas while you have a permanent limp is kinda dumb, but besides that."
01-03-2021T05:59:45,unsteddyphoenix,he was having a moment I respect it
01-03-2021T06:00:02,Dadrobit,Being the big hero
01-03-2021T06:02:27,Dadrobit,Did have to call an ambulance for him myself a month or two back. Called me up and sounded drunk as hell. Remembered he had diabetes and turned out his sugar was running on fumes. That was a scary night.
01-03-2021T06:03:39,Dadrobit,"The guy isn't actually part of my company and works completely alone at the country club. He was very lucky he had the wherewithal to call me on my personal to ""say goodbye"". Not a fun phone call."
01-03-2021T06:25:22,unsteddyphoenix,jesus he forgot he had diabetes
01-03-2021T06:25:34,unsteddyphoenix,Feels like someone should be helping him in general
01-03-2021T06:26:05,Twokinds,I just realized I forgot a part of the script when I streamed progress on the last page.
01-03-2021T06:26:11,Twokinds,Debating if I should try to work it in.
01-03-2021T06:30:23,Dadrobit,"I mean, I don't blame him or anything. When a diabetic starts having issues from low blood sugar, it is literally the same symptoms of a person who's full on black out drunk."
01-03-2021T06:31:03,unsteddyphoenix,"Ooof. A lot of that page was done, wasnt it? Unless you mean making it a bit longer"
01-03-2021T06:31:31,unsteddyphoenix,So he called you and not an ambulance lol. Not sure if wholesome or extremely worrying
01-03-2021T06:31:42,Dadrobit,"Both, definitely both."
01-03-2021T06:32:18,Dadrobit,Though the conversation was 95/5 split on worrisome to wholesome ratio.
01-03-2021T06:32:26,Twokinds,"That's the problem with streaming comic progress. Once people see me work on it, they'll be confused if I change something."
01-03-2021T06:32:57,Dadrobit,"Eh, the streaming audience is really really minor compared to your actual audience no?"
01-03-2021T06:33:00,unsteddyphoenix,"Well that doesnt really matter, right?"
01-03-2021T06:33:02,Dadrobit,Meh*
01-03-2021T06:33:29,Dadrobit,"Worst case, someone asks why it was changed next stream and they immediately get over it lol."
01-03-2021T06:33:58,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah exactly. Dont let that influence you at all!
01-03-2021T06:34:45,Dadrobit,It's not like the part you left out is that you're suddenly bringing Alaric back or anything right? Then you're safe.
01-03-2021T06:35:23,Twokinds,No one excited for Alarbbly?
01-03-2021T06:35:45,Dadrobit,"Fuck, do it"
01-03-2021T06:35:56,Dadrobit,"For the memes, Tom! For the memes!"
01-03-2021T06:35:56,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
01-03-2021T06:37:05,unsteddyphoenix,Oh man. That would be so good
01-03-2021T06:37:37,Dadrobit,No wonder that squirrel is so hardy!
01-03-2021T06:37:38,unsteddyphoenix,"After all the outrage of the last one, you do it again. Thatd be peak april fools"
01-03-2021T06:39:30,Dadrobit,"Mmmm, and with Alaric being the big gay, that would explain ""Mrs"" Nibbly's attraction to Sythe! It's all coming together!"
01-03-2021T06:39:34,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:

01-03-2021T06:42:36,Dadrobit,Grats on the dumb art! That's exactly an infinite amount more art that I have done in the last month!
01-03-2021T06:44:15,TerraTheWizard,can i share the link to it? it's totally safe just very dumb
01-03-2021T06:44:58,Dadrobit,I'll at least take a whisper

01-03-2021T06:48:33,Dadrobit,Furries*
01-03-2021T06:48:47,Dadrobit,I'm in the wrong business.

01-03-2021T12:12:33,CrRAR,I dare not touch the coffee rn
01-03-2021T12:12:51,SpazztasticKiwi,when did they make coke with coffee
01-03-2021T12:13:09,CrRAR,uh 2006?
01-03-2021T12:13:19,CrRAR,It was called Coke Blak
01-03-2021T12:13:26,CrRAR,something like that
01-03-2021T12:13:36,CrRAR,It was... interesting
01-03-2021T12:13:39,SpazztasticKiwi,how‚Äôve I never seen it
01-03-2021T12:14:06,CrRAR,it was during that first new age bottled coffee beverage rush days
01-03-2021T12:14:27,CrRAR,like when energy drinks were first getting big
01-03-2021T12:14:49,CrRAR,So like it probably just got lost in the whirlwind
01-03-2021T12:15:13,SpazztasticKiwi,so
01-03-2021T12:15:19,SpazztasticKiwi,carbonated coffee?
01-03-2021T12:15:49,CrRAR,"It was kind of along the flavor mixture of a mocha, but with coke instead of chocolate"
01-03-2021T12:18:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Jesus it tastes like
01-03-2021T12:18:15,SpazztasticKiwi,coffee with coke
01-03-2021T12:18:59,CrRAR,it also was sold only in 4‚Äôs
01-03-2021T12:19:06,CrRAR,never canned afaik
01-03-2021T12:19:30,CrRAR,so like you had to buy a goofy 4 pack of like 6 or 8oz bottles

01-03-2021T12:21:16,CrRAR,"wait, really?"

01-03-2021T23:43:52,BlueStreak98,Sythe may be better armed but Remus is still much bigger and stronger. Could make for interesting combat

01-03-2021T23:44:06,CrRAR,yup
