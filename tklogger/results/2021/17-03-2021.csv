17-03-2021T15:16:15,AspiringNoodle,Debating doing deliveries tonight
17-03-2021T15:16:23,AspiringNoodle,"It's raining, so tips might be extra juicy~"
17-03-2021T15:17:03,AspiringNoodle,And apparently GrubHub has like NO presence in my area.  Barely any restaurants that do delivery.  GrubHub just facilitates online orders for pickup for most :|
17-03-2021T15:17:15,Twokinds,I always wonder how delivery drivers feel about going out in rain. I always feel bad ordering when it's raining.
17-03-2021T15:17:45,AspiringNoodle,Last year I bought some really good winter weather tires that will make the rain mostly meaningless.
17-03-2021T15:18:02,AspiringNoodle,"I also default to wearing a hoodie in rainy weather, so my only concern is keeping the food hot and not soaked xD"
17-03-2021T15:18:45,Twokinds,"I remember one time when I was younger, I had a pizza delivered, not knowing it was raining."
17-03-2021T15:18:59,AspiringNoodle,D:
17-03-2021T15:19:08,Twokinds,And then I forgot to tip him!

17-03-2021T15:19:21,Twokinds,I felt so terrible I called the pizza place XD
17-03-2021T15:19:21,AspiringNoodle,"Tom noooooo, how could youuuuuu"
17-03-2021T15:19:37,Twokinds,I was just trying to get the guy out of the rain quickly and didn't think about it.
17-03-2021T15:20:03,AspiringNoodle,"It's okay, I still feel bad about a delivery I messed up"
17-03-2021T15:20:23,AspiringNoodle,Failed to double check that the entire order was there when it was given to me by restaurant staff
17-03-2021T15:20:39,Twokinds,Aw man. It happens
17-03-2021T15:21:06,AspiringNoodle,Staff forgot to put a house salad in the bag.  I shall know the shame of that 1-star until I get my 102-nd review
17-03-2021T15:21:28,AspiringNoodle,"On the bright side, my other 6 reviews are 5-stars, and 1 customer thought I went above and beyond :ptv-hearts:"

17-03-2021T15:22:34,AspiringNoodle,"Tom, order a pizza"
17-03-2021T15:22:40,AspiringNoodle,And tip the delivery guy extra :p
17-03-2021T15:23:05,Twokinds,"Unless someone messes up my order, I usually always just check the 'did good job' boxes"
