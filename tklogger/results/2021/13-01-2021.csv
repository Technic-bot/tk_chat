13-01-2021T16:26:45,SonOfGoku,"I just started downloading Subnautica earlier, how is it?"
13-01-2021T16:30:56,CrimsonQuill,...Scary.
13-01-2021T16:31:06,CrimsonQuill,It is masterful in its use of tension and suspense.
13-01-2021T16:31:54,CrimsonQuill,"Word of advice: Hull reinforcement ASAP. And for goodness' sake, unless there's no other choice, stay away from the Dunes, Mountains and Crash Zones, as those are the Reaper's favourite places."
13-01-2021T16:32:12,CrimsonQuill,"But yes, it is very scary."
13-01-2021T16:32:21,CrimsonQuill,And it has great progression.
13-01-2021T16:34:03,SonOfGoku,Good to know
13-01-2021T16:41:41,AspiringNoodle,Subnautica is a game I want to play
13-01-2021T16:41:52,AspiringNoodle,"It is beautiful, immersive, and mystifying"
13-01-2021T16:42:12,AspiringNoodle,But at the same time braves the depths of the human psyche to terrify us in familiar and ancient ways.
13-01-2021T16:42:29,AspiringNoodle,"Also, if you want a good time, go outside the bounds of the game map"
13-01-2021T16:44:34,SonOfGoku,I got lucky and got it for free a while back
