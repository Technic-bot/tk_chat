10-02-2021T16:32:22,CrimsonQuill086,I forgot to get tea...and I don't like leaving my bedroom after getting into the evening zone...
10-02-2021T16:32:26,CrimsonQuill086,Hi SpaceCadety
10-02-2021T16:33:17,CrimsonQuill086,"I have this problem where I feel like I can't really fully enjoy anything Twokinds related until I know I won't be talking to other people for the night. (Family excepted),"
10-02-2021T16:35:31,CrimsonQuill086,"I just like to get fully invested, and going back to the 'real world' straight afterwards is kind of distressing."
10-02-2021T16:36:58,NinoGD,oof
10-02-2021T16:41:23,CrRAR,"uhh, sometimes little things in the real world will remind me of some of the characters and such. Or like I'll have a thought of how they'd react to something."
10-02-2021T16:41:42,CrRAR,silly stuff like that
10-02-2021T16:42:11,CrimsonQuill086,"For me a lot of it has to do with the fact that I'm living in a digs, with different people, in the middle of a city."
10-02-2021T16:42:34,CrimsonQuill086,Basically it's a homesickness/nostalgia/familiarity thing
10-02-2021T17:09:39,CrimsonQuill086,I may also be making a huge mistake.
10-02-2021T17:10:23,CrimsonQuill086,"I am going to go through all the Twokinds pictures-sketches, colours etc. and resave the ones I like, sorting them with names by theme or series wherever one turns up. I thought I could leave it be, but my OCD Demands it."
10-02-2021T17:11:06,CrimsonQuill086,"Probably tomorrow night, however. Or Saturday night."
10-02-2021T17:13:04,AspiringNoodle,"Man, after watching HH / HB, I just wanna draw Octavia ;-;"
10-02-2021T17:13:14,AspiringNoodle,She was so cute as a child.  And I feel for her as a teen.
10-02-2021T17:13:22,CrimsonQuill086,"Remind me, which one is Octavia again?"
10-02-2021T17:13:37,AspiringNoodle,Stolas' daughter
10-02-2021T17:14:08,AspiringNoodle,HB pilot and episode 2 are my favorites so far
10-02-2021T17:14:39,AspiringNoodle,"The Pilot because you get a really good feel for the characters, and I love how Loona is just horrible, but she's so damn entertaining.  Also Blitzo just fawning over her :p"
10-02-2021T17:15:04,AspiringNoodle,And then episode 2 because of the relationship between Octavia and Stolas
10-02-2021T17:15:28,AspiringNoodle,I can't wait to see how their dynamic changes as we get more interaction with her mother.
10-02-2021T17:15:35,CrimsonQuill086,"Wait, there are more episodes?"
10-02-2021T17:15:46,CrimsonQuill086,Oh shoot. I have some catching up to do.
10-02-2021T17:16:20,AspiringNoodle,"Yeah, we got The Murder Family, Loo Loo Land, and Spring Broken"
10-02-2021T17:16:39,AspiringNoodle,...I want to watch Loo Loo Land again...
10-02-2021T17:17:04,AspiringNoodle,"Stolas really is a great father.  He may have genuinely effed up, but he loves her with all his heart."
10-02-2021T17:22:07,AspiringNoodle,"That said, Spring Broken adds some character development for Loona"
10-02-2021T17:24:59,NinoGD,i lost count how many times i've listened to That's Life by Frank Sinatra

10-02-2021T19:29:21,CrRAR,12x27 sounds like old school house dimentions
10-02-2021T19:29:32,CrRAR,or something like that
10-02-2021T19:30:22,SonOfGoku,I can see it being a tiny house
