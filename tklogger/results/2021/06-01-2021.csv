06-01-2021T17:19:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"quick Tom - shrimp, lobster or crab?"
06-01-2021T17:20:02,CrimsonQuill,@SonOfGoky Your Dog has good taste...they're so gorgeous too!
06-01-2021T17:21:22,Twokinds,In what regard?
06-01-2021T17:21:33,SpazztasticKiwi,which do you think is better
06-01-2021T17:21:51,Twokinds,Crabs look cool.
06-01-2021T17:22:04,Twokinds,:crab:
06-01-2021T17:22:29,CrimsonQuill,Crabs!
06-01-2021T17:22:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"I guess oysters, clams, & mussels go in too but it’s more common that people have tried the first three"
06-01-2021T17:22:40,CrimsonQuill,:crab::crab::crab:
06-01-2021T17:22:46,Twokinds,I'd say they're more interesting than shrimp or lobster
06-01-2021T17:23:05,SpazztasticKiwi,this wouldn’t be influenced by the presence of mr crab would it
06-01-2021T17:23:56,Twokinds,I dunno
06-01-2021T17:24:42,NinoGD,I like lobster
06-01-2021T17:25:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"I like shrimp best but it’s that there’s not any good (ie, nonshady) places that I know to get it here"
06-01-2021T17:26:01,SpazztasticKiwi,“it” = lobster
06-01-2021T17:26:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"crab is good but the times I’ve gotten it, they pack too many seasonings and stuffing in it"
06-01-2021T17:28:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw somebody put a bottle in a crabs claw & pop the top ... along with others who think it’s cool to put a crab near their face right up until it pinches

06-01-2021T17:32:06,CrRAR,"crab is more plain tasting, maybe that’s why"
06-01-2021T17:32:15,CrRAR,crab cakes are popular
06-01-2021T17:32:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I can’t remember if I’ve had a crab cake or not
06-01-2021T17:34:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"& speaking of pets earlier, tis rainy n cold & I had a smol fuzzy black void on the bed earlier"

06-01-2021T18:43:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I like the glass mug
06-01-2021T18:44:32,CrRAR,The handle one? Seems mighty
06-01-2021T18:45:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I question why fb is still so insistent on ads that suggest I have a boyfriend
06-01-2021T18:46:05,CrRAR,They have military-issue looking christmas stockings
06-01-2021T18:46:12,CrRAR,filled with jerky

06-01-2021T18:47:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t remember if I liked them more or if they just had something i liked more
06-01-2021T18:47:57,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s a craft jerky company
06-01-2021T18:48:37,SpazztasticKiwi,but it’s a subscription....& not the right company
06-01-2021T18:48:37,CrRAR,It’s insane how many businesses there are... in the same business now.
06-01-2021T18:49:24,CrRAR,so many choices
06-01-2021T18:49:43,SpazztasticKiwi,ads be like: JERKY FLOWERS! GET HIM A VIKING CARVING KNIFE! HAVE AN OX HORN MUG
06-01-2021T18:49:58,CrRAR,haha
06-01-2021T18:49:59,SpazztasticKiwi,...here’s a dress shop

06-01-2021T18:51:17,CrRAR,You’d thing there would be a larger amount of cat gifts and such suggested
06-01-2021T18:51:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"because if I do have one, I’d like to see him too you know"
06-01-2021T18:51:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I get the occasional amazon pet supplies ad or cat loot crate subscription box ad
06-01-2021T18:52:14,CrRAR,Maybe bagheera does gift shopping in secret
06-01-2021T18:52:26,CrRAR,to drop likely-suggestion hints
06-01-2021T18:53:00,CrRAR,Ah
06-01-2021T18:53:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"the subscription boxes on amazon are, multi cat, (single cat in mind) with treats & toys, (single cat in mind) just toys - for cats with sensitive tummies"
06-01-2021T18:53:57,CrRAR,comes in a box!

06-01-2021T18:54:58,CrRAR,Don’t want to offend the otherwise fit cats in the family I guess
06-01-2021T18:55:23,SpazztasticKiwi,because Kiwi needs weight-conscious food and treats that are due free & Bagheera can have pretty much anything
06-01-2021T18:55:30,SpazztasticKiwi,dye
06-01-2021T18:56:11,SpazztasticKiwi,the struggle to find the balance is real
06-01-2021T18:56:25,CrRAR,Bagheera void of both light and noms.
