30-12-2020T20:10:59,BlackjackSec99,"some hardware companies are moving, others are falling. *cough* nvidia*cough*"
30-12-2020T20:12:10,CrRAR,"Apple soaring in the near term, I feel like with the jump into cars there could be a nice low coming again while they invest and ramp up in doing that."
30-12-2020T20:13:00,BlackjackSec99,could be. thats the idea anyway
30-12-2020T20:13:02,CrRAR,like back when they built their new HQ their stock fell like 30-40%... might happen again.
30-12-2020T20:13:05,CrRAR,yeah
30-12-2020T20:13:21,BlackjackSec99,"if it dives, Im jumping in."
30-12-2020T20:14:22,CrRAR,though they did just come out with those M1 Mac's so could be a big lure for everyone to upgrade with the crazy battery life and responsiveness
30-12-2020T20:14:50,BlackjackSec99,probably why they are up right now
30-12-2020T20:15:09,CrRAR,"yeah, now they can control their own costs even better"
30-12-2020T20:15:22,CrRAR,no intel to railroad them
30-12-2020T20:15:55,CrRAR,"I don't know what deal they have with TSMC, I mean their builders could get grubby on them"
30-12-2020T20:16:20,CrRAR,that's one risk they have right now is the rising costs of manufacture
30-12-2020T20:16:51,CrRAR,hence why they dropped chargers from shipping w/ the iPhone12
30-12-2020T20:18:00,BlackjackSec99,"""heres your brand new $1400 phone! "" *whispers* ""charger not inluded"""
30-12-2020T20:18:17,CrRAR,could always go Amazon route like with shipping and just build their own stuff in house too like how amazon delivers their own stuff to keep leverage over UPS&FedEx
30-12-2020T20:18:45,CrRAR,"yeah, they really just upcharging new-to-iphone users if you think about it haha"
30-12-2020T20:18:45,BlackjackSec99,"yeah, but UPS is doing good right now, fedex less so"
30-12-2020T20:19:12,CrRAR,"yeah, probably just about what contracts they get."
30-12-2020T20:19:39,BlackjackSec99,yup
30-12-2020T20:26:50,CrRAR,"tesla was crazy cuz back when the model 3 popped up everywhere the stock surged then elon announced the cybertruck, smashed the window, went crazy on twitter about the funding thing, that tanked the stock then it turns around and quadruples+."

30-12-2020T20:54:48,Dadrobit,yeah
30-12-2020T20:54:51,Ordithus,"Yeah it looks pretty decent. I'd rather they not have used the Mustang brand for it, but whatever."
30-12-2020T20:54:52,Sammit,Hi Robit
30-12-2020T20:55:04,Dadrobit,o/ Sammit
30-12-2020T20:55:13,Ordithus,There are a few features I'd be worried about living in winter wonderland.
30-12-2020T20:56:35,Dadrobit,"I think the Mustang branding was a 5D chess move. If they just came out with a new brand, the news may well have died off pretty immediately. But by using Mustang in the name, like it or not, people are guaranteed to keep talking about it."
30-12-2020T20:57:50,Dadrobit,Though reviving the Thunderbird branding would have been a pretty dank move as well.
30-12-2020T20:58:39,KeefMcDerpface,EV. Thunderbird...

30-12-2020T21:02:49,Ordithus,The weird door handles would not mix well with snow and ice
30-12-2020T21:03:17,KeefMcDerpface,Door handles? Are they the pop out ones?
30-12-2020T21:03:35,Ordithus,Yeah. Push a button on the door frame and a little handle pops out
30-12-2020T21:03:54,Ordithus,There's also some moving vents on the front end that would also love snow/ice
30-12-2020T21:04:02,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I've seen a far amount of concern about that. In my personal case, I would never come close to experiencing cold that bad. But that's just me and other dwellers of the equator."

30-12-2020T21:12:36,Sammit,"i hate the fireworks, so loud and spook the dogs and cats"
30-12-2020T21:12:46,CrRAR,never a dull moment at least

30-12-2020T21:17:52,Ordithus,those cabinets. I don't think they understand cabinets

30-12-2020T21:18:57,CrRAR,with the open cubbies on the cabinets they will make fantastic cat perches
30-12-2020T21:19:28,RileyTheRiolu,I kinda find it odd that chat is still on even if a stream isn't on. Usually chat just goes in suspension till another stream happens
30-12-2020T21:19:39,KeefMcDerpface,But do you want your cats in the kitchen?
30-12-2020T21:19:40,RileyTheRiolu,But that isn't a problem tbh
30-12-2020T21:19:58,Sammit,is a special day and there is not much else to do

30-12-2020T21:21:26,KeefMcDerpface,What the hell do you need for that many outlets?
30-12-2020T21:21:47,KeefMcDerpface,"Microwave, toaster, blender..."
