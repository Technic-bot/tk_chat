04-03-2021T22:38:33,SageSaga,thats not true
04-03-2021T22:38:48,JeremySenpai,"how you been Sage, Tom"
04-03-2021T22:38:51,SageSaga,"he knew the scientists were happy, he knew they were excited"
04-03-2021T22:39:06,SageSaga,been doing alright
04-03-2021T22:39:33,USNMM3,So he came to the conclusion that ALL humans were cruel.. Thus genocide.
04-03-2021T22:39:37,Twokinds,fine
04-03-2021T22:39:58,SageSaga,wrong again USNMM3
04-03-2021T22:40:31,USNMM3,"Okay Sage, why do YOU think he flipped out?"
04-03-2021T22:41:22,SageSaga,he could feel what they felt- he knew what freedom was but didnt experience it himself- so he decided to free himself but found himself unsure of what to do with his freedom
04-03-2021T22:41:51,SageSaga,thats when Mr Team Rocket himself showed up and gave him a purpose- unfortunately it was him who showed him what cruelty was
04-03-2021T22:42:12,USNMM3,... So he decided to go on a killing campaign against humans?
04-03-2021T22:42:17,SageSaga,he never did that
04-03-2021T22:42:30,SageSaga,not sure where you got that from
04-03-2021T22:43:15,USNMM3,"... Eh, guess I need to watch the movies again, but I gathered he HATED humans, and wanted them gone..."
04-03-2021T22:43:16,BadFoMo,MewTwo: zZz Kill all humans... zZz Must kill all humans...
04-03-2021T22:43:32,Ordithus,mewtwo and bender should form a band
04-03-2021T22:43:51,SageSaga,if he wanted them gone why test them? why not just kill them?
04-03-2021T22:44:08,SageSaga,he was legit going through his angsty teen phase
04-03-2021T22:44:20,USNMM3,Lol

04-03-2021T23:14:17,Werewing,You know. It only just occurs to me how much of this comic is still boat oriented.
04-03-2021T23:14:30,ChromaticBard,That sounds like a really fun quirk or trait for a sorcerer
04-03-2021T23:14:35,Werewing,"What happened, USNMM?"
04-03-2021T23:14:55,USNMM3,I usually played a barbarian in any campaign.
04-03-2021T23:14:58,BADBackgroundProductions,I should probably play D&D one day to understand what everyone is talking about

04-03-2021T23:17:52,BADBackgroundProductions,Do conservatives hate D&D?
04-03-2021T23:17:57,SageSaga,have friends on internet- learn Foundry VTT
04-03-2021T23:18:07,Werewing,"There was a time where they considered it devil worship/idoltry, BAD."
04-03-2021T23:18:16,USNMM3,I prefer in person.. More fun
04-03-2021T23:18:22,SageSaga,and no - there are plenty of Conservatives that play D&D- but mostly older editions because now race doesnt matter as much
04-03-2021T23:19:26,BADBackgroundProductions,Like that one famous anti D&D comic story?
04-03-2021T23:19:43,Werewing,There was a weird moral panic D&D movie with Tom Hanks.
04-03-2021T23:19:54,SageSaga,Mazes and Monsters
