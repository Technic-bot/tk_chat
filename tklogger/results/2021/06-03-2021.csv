06-03-2021T16:16:48,Roughlandin,I'd just graduated high school
06-03-2021T16:16:59,ProsePro7,I was three years out of college
06-03-2021T16:17:26,ThingsAreMoving,It was my first year of emigration
06-03-2021T16:17:28,ZapiliDver,"2011 - got kicked from job for ""funny"" trick"
06-03-2021T16:17:30,ThingsAreMoving,bleh
06-03-2021T16:17:34,CrimsonQuill086,11/11/11... I'm willing to bet that Remembrance day suffered some disruption because of that game.
06-03-2021T16:17:43,CrimsonQuill086,A lot of features left on Cutting Room Floor too
06-03-2021T16:18:15,BadFoMo,"I'd like to play a lot of games, but the computer's power pack isn't pwoerful enough for the new graphics card and now it crashes when ever there are too many particals on screen."
06-03-2021T16:18:28,BadFoMo,...Or when ever.
06-03-2021T16:18:51,ZapiliDver,"Bad, better got a more powerful PSU, or you can deep fry your card =)"
06-03-2021T16:19:08,ThingsAreMoving,"yup, that's one of the reasons for buying a great PSU when I decided I'm gonna start upgrading my PC"
06-03-2021T16:19:27,ZapiliDver,And don't even look at aerocool products
06-03-2021T16:19:28,ThingsAreMoving,that's one of the components you absolutely don't want to save money on
06-03-2021T16:19:53,CrimsonQuill086,My friend helped me make a budget computer last January
06-03-2021T16:20:05,CrimsonQuill086,Now it's...not quite so budget anymore
06-03-2021T16:20:22,Glassan,"Indeed. Plus, a good power supply can last years to support updating rigs."
06-03-2021T16:20:25,ZapiliDver,If you have troubles with money - FSP PSU is best thing to buy.
06-03-2021T16:20:35,ZapiliDver,If you have a lot of money - Seasonic
06-03-2021T16:20:48,SpazztasticKiwi,y‚Äôall I walked a mile
06-03-2021T16:20:57,SpazztasticKiwi,now I don‚Äôt wanna move anymore
06-03-2021T16:21:06,Ordithus,in whose shoes?
06-03-2021T16:21:07,Glassan,Sounds fun
06-03-2021T16:21:07,ThingsAreMoving,a whole mile?
06-03-2021T16:21:11,CrRAR,gooood
06-03-2021T16:21:15,BadFoMo,Maybe when the pleage blows over I'll look into getting a PSU that will fit in this thing (This is an odd ball last time I checked).
06-03-2021T16:21:25,Brocade,Hi everyone

06-03-2021T16:25:51,SpazztasticKiwi,so Tom did you not sleep last night
06-03-2021T16:26:09,Roughlandin,Hi Beast!
06-03-2021T16:26:12,ZapiliDver,Hi Beast

06-03-2021T16:27:05,ThingsAreMoving,I should grind some coffee beans in case I need them.
06-03-2021T16:27:14,Sammit,Hi Beast
06-03-2021T16:28:02,CrRAR,"coffee grounds, good for brewing coffee and blinding unsuspecting enemies!"
06-03-2021T16:28:13,CrimsonQuill086,...tea gone...
06-03-2021T16:28:14,Ordithus,waste of good coffee
06-03-2021T16:28:19,CrimsonQuill086,Flapjacks nommed...
06-03-2021T16:28:25,CrimsonQuill086,Cookie devoured...
06-03-2021T16:28:30,CrimsonQuill086,And cake lied to me
06-03-2021T16:28:43,CrimsonQuill086,I have no restraint with my Sunday snacc plate.
06-03-2021T16:28:49,ZapiliDver,cake is a lie
06-03-2021T16:28:50,CrimsonQuill086,It's there one moment...then it's just...gone.
06-03-2021T16:29:06,CrimsonQuill086,@ZapiliDver I thought it was a pie.
06-03-2021T16:29:17,ThingsAreMoving,Grounds can only be used for blinding after brewing.
06-03-2021T16:29:36,ThingsAreMoving,"Like Ord said, some respect for good coffee is needed."
06-03-2021T16:29:43,Ordithus,that is better
06-03-2021T16:29:52,TheSexyBeast,"Hey Zap, Sam, Ord, FoMo, Things, Rough, Quill, CrRar"
06-03-2021T16:29:53,CrRAR,maybe that‚Äôs what decaf is good for then
06-03-2021T16:30:02,BadFoMo,Yo.
06-03-2021T16:30:05,ThingsAreMoving,I was tired of buying 1kg bags of beans every month
06-03-2021T16:30:27,ThingsAreMoving,So I bought 6kg in one go. Should last me for a bit
06-03-2021T16:30:30,Ordithus,nice
06-03-2021T16:30:39,ZapiliDver,1Kg of beans per month :ptv-excited:
06-03-2021T16:30:50,Ordithus,only problem with that is now you can't change roast so easy
06-03-2021T16:31:12,ThingsAreMoving,I'm using the same one for quite a bit now
06-03-2021T16:31:29,ThingsAreMoving,I tried like 12 different ones and settled with the one I liked the most
06-03-2021T16:31:56,CrRAR,Achievement get: Find Good Brew
06-03-2021T16:32:08,TheSexyBeast,I wanted to try Black Rifle until I saw the price at the Walmart üò±
06-03-2021T16:32:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Go to there site
06-03-2021T16:32:37,Ordithus,"I get all my coffee from two local roasters, is good"
06-03-2021T16:32:40,Glassan,"Black Rifle is honestly good coffee,"
06-03-2021T16:32:52,SpazztasticKiwi,me shopping: ‚Äúoh that‚Äôs cute.......‚Äù *checks tag* ‚Äúno it‚Äôs not‚Äù
06-03-2021T16:33:15,ZapiliDver,I'm mainly on Toraja blend
06-03-2021T16:33:17,CrRAR,‚Äúsuddenly... less cute‚Äù
06-03-2021T16:33:23,CrimsonQuill086,Barry's Tea or Earl Grey...I don't go for coffee very often
06-03-2021T16:33:40,ThingsAreMoving,"Yeah, I even tried Death wish coffee. Import fees felt like extorsion."
06-03-2021T16:33:45,ProsePro7,I just drink it from the bottle.  Stok is a good brand
06-03-2021T16:33:53,ThingsAreMoving,And tbh it's nothing special when it comes to taste.
06-03-2021T16:33:57,Glassan,Death Wish to me was... not great.
06-03-2021T16:34:02,ThingsAreMoving,But it pack one hell of a kick
06-03-2021T16:34:07,ThingsAreMoving,packs*
06-03-2021T16:34:08,Glassan,Oh it does.
06-03-2021T16:34:48,TheSexyBeast,"I need kick, but not for $20/bag"
06-03-2021T16:35:22,Glassan,"Yeah, DW is not worth that. Especially for those drinking coffee for flavor/enjoyment."
06-03-2021T16:35:31,ThingsAreMoving,my current one is ~20$ / kg
06-03-2021T16:35:36,ThingsAreMoving,worth every penny
06-03-2021T16:35:44,ZapiliDver,Need a kick (WARNING: BAD HOR HEALTH) - mix any crappy coffee with coca-cola.
06-03-2021T16:35:57,ThingsAreMoving,that makes you hear colors
06-03-2021T16:36:01,Glassan,That... Sounds painful.
06-03-2021T16:36:18,CrimsonQuill086,"Sometimes it is worth it for the price...Tesco Earl Grey is almost as good as the official stuff, and does me a lot of the time, but one can't quite beat the Twinings original."
06-03-2021T16:36:19,Glassan,And probably smell chimes.
06-03-2021T16:36:24,CrimsonQuill086,At least in my books.
06-03-2021T16:36:42,Roughlandin,Coke and coffee sounds like an instant stomach ulcer to me lol
06-03-2021T16:36:46,TheSexyBeast,Whatever happened to the good tasting plain black cup of coffee?
06-03-2021T16:36:48,Glassan,I think the best coffee I ever had I got in El Salvador from a local grower for like $2 USD
06-03-2021T16:36:58,ThingsAreMoving,"When it comes to tea, I usually buy Assam / Breakfast / Scottish / Earl grey teabags from Lidl"
06-03-2021T16:37:14,Glassan,"Adding cream to that coffee was straight up blasphemy, it was that smooth."
06-03-2021T16:37:19,ThingsAreMoving,"I'm not picky, and they taste pretty decent imho"
06-03-2021T16:38:17,TheSexyBeast,Twinings is my go to brand for tea.
06-03-2021T16:38:19,CrimsonQuill086,"Oh, Assam is gorgeous...but I can't really abide the Lidl stuff."
06-03-2021T16:38:43,ZapiliDver,"Coke+Coffee=Huge kick, cell walking and after a few hours instant sleep. But if you have troubles with heart it will harm you."
06-03-2021T16:38:45,CrimsonQuill086,"It might be because I worked in kitchen for a year and the chefs gave me some nice meals, but my smell and taste changed quite a bit after that year."
06-03-2021T16:38:51,ThingsAreMoving,My friend used to be a guard in Twinnings factory.
06-03-2021T16:38:59,CrimsonQuill086,So I can taste a distinct difference between them
06-03-2021T16:39:07,CrimsonQuill086,"Oh, neat Things!"""
06-03-2021T16:39:08,ThingsAreMoving,I never thought there were so many different kinds and mixes of tea
06-03-2021T16:39:13,Glassan,"Amazing how being exposed to good food can do that, Crimson."
06-03-2021T16:39:28,CrimsonQuill086,They were hearty and nice meals alright
06-03-2021T16:39:37,CrimsonQuill086,Nursing home patients need their calories
06-03-2021T16:39:41,ThingsAreMoving,But he always managed to bring a new kind after every shift
06-03-2021T16:39:47,Glassan,"Tea, Coffee, Chocolate, Wine, Beer... All have grown into their own sciences by this point."
06-03-2021T16:40:08,ZapiliDver,"I don't think that there is a lot of black/red teas exist, but somaday i've visited chieneese tea shop site...."
06-03-2021T16:40:10,Ordithus,you can get a degree in a few of those I'm sure
06-03-2021T16:40:15,TheSexyBeast,"Scotch, bourbon, rum"
06-03-2021T16:40:19,ThingsAreMoving,Nothing wrong with good ol' cup of coffee
06-03-2021T16:40:20,CrimsonQuill086,"Right now I have six in the cupboard...some Rooibos, some Earl Grey, some English Breakfast, Barry's, Lavenderandhoney, and Camomile"
06-03-2021T16:40:27,CrimsonQuill086,No scotch for me right now
06-03-2021T16:40:35,CrimsonQuill086,I've given up Alcohol for Lent
06-03-2021T16:40:44,ThingsAreMoving,"but if you spend some extra monies, you can tel;l there's a huge difference in quality"
06-03-2021T16:40:52,CrimsonQuill086,"Agreed, Things."
06-03-2021T16:41:01,ZapiliDver,Green Sencha good too
06-03-2021T16:41:08,ThingsAreMoving,It's like comparing instant type ramen noodles with a bowl from a good Ramen-ya shop
06-03-2021T16:41:21,CrimsonQuill086,The biggest difference for me was Supervalu store brand vs Odlums porridge.
06-03-2021T16:41:37,Skornos,Hey everyone!
06-03-2021T16:41:40,ThingsAreMoving,\o
06-03-2021T16:41:41,CrimsonQuill086,"Supervalu store brand were cheap, but had an unpleasant, almost soapy aftertaste"
06-03-2021T16:41:44,Ordithus,"yeah, when I first started drinking coffee I hated folger's. now, it's alright. if prepared well"
06-03-2021T16:41:45,CrimsonQuill086,Hiya Skornos!

06-03-2021T16:42:12,Ordithus,"what I hated was a meh coffee, burned to death"
06-03-2021T16:42:16,TheSexyBeast,BRB
06-03-2021T16:42:19,CrimsonQuill086,"Odlums on the other hand...woah. Sometimes I don't even put in any toppings. Lemme tell ya, Odlums oats and flour are wonderful"
06-03-2021T16:42:25,ThingsAreMoving,medium dark roast for me
06-03-2021T16:42:29,CrimsonQuill086,"They do Gluten Free too, which is especially useful."
06-03-2021T16:42:48,Ordithus,"by brewing, not roasting, is what I meant, things"
06-03-2021T16:43:00,ZapiliDver,Hi Skornos
06-03-2021T16:43:04,Ordithus,though my fave is light roast
06-03-2021T16:43:04,ThingsAreMoving,"Ah, right"
06-03-2021T16:43:09,Roughlandin,There's this company called Black Rifle Coffee Co. They make a super dark roast called Murdered Out lol. It's actually really good.
06-03-2021T16:43:45,ThingsAreMoving,"Pour over tastes the best for me, but my trusty french press is good enough for me."
06-03-2021T16:43:51,Glassan,Murdered out is an excellent coffee from them.
06-03-2021T16:44:13,ThingsAreMoving,If I feel super fancy I filter the brew so that it's extra smooth.
06-03-2021T16:44:19,Glassan,I only started trying BRCC after I discovered they put a M134 Vulcan on a Prius.
06-03-2021T16:44:28,Glassan,Then I learned they also had good coffee.
06-03-2021T16:44:35,Glassan,Good times.
06-03-2021T16:45:10,Roughlandin,"Yeah the advertising is a whole thing, but even beyond that, they make dang good coffee"
06-03-2021T16:45:35,Roughlandin,It's super dark but not acidic at all. Their coffee was what finally got me to start drinking my coffee black
06-03-2021T16:45:40,ThingsAreMoving,I have yet to try brewing by actually simmering the grounds in water for a good while. It should make it even stronger but I dunno about the taste.
06-03-2021T16:45:42,Glassan,"Come because of the ads, stay because the product is actually good."
06-03-2021T16:45:43,Brocade,I got a Moka pot and it's great
06-03-2021T16:45:50,Brocade,way easier to clean than my french press
06-03-2021T16:46:25,CrRAR,old fashioned percolated is still pretty legit
06-03-2021T16:46:41,ThingsAreMoving,"Moka pots are great, but I get exactly two big cups out of my french press as opposed to one from a moka pot"
06-03-2021T16:46:52,ZapiliDver,I prefer cezve

06-03-2021T16:47:34,CrRAR,yeah I like pour over too
06-03-2021T16:47:34,Roughlandin,I think I'm gonna try cold brewing this summer
06-03-2021T16:47:34,ThingsAreMoving,isn't percolated and pored over the same?
06-03-2021T16:47:41,CrRAR,pretty much

06-03-2021T16:47:51,Ordithus,"no no, percolators brew very differently"
06-03-2021T16:47:56,CrRAR,more thorough
06-03-2021T16:47:57,Ordithus,pour over is closest to drip

06-03-2021T16:49:00,CrRAR,yeah that‚Äôs why percing long is bad
06-03-2021T16:49:06,CrRAR,just like 3 mins

06-03-2021T20:10:12,Roughlandin,Right now we're going through the Plato and the Socratic Dialogues

06-03-2021T22:14:43,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:
06-03-2021T22:16:38,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,would Raine have been raised by the female version of Euchre in this Au?
06-03-2021T22:16:54,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
06-03-2021T22:17:03,unsteddyphoenix,braine
06-03-2021T22:17:06,Twokinds,"Uh... no, I don't see any reason why"
06-03-2021T22:17:19,Twokinds,Changing genders doesn't really effect who she would go with?
06-03-2021T22:17:27,Roughlandin,Braine lol
06-03-2021T22:17:28,ThingsAreMoving,She'd stay with her dad
06-03-2021T22:17:33,ThingsAreMoving,he'd
06-03-2021T22:17:36,ThingsAreMoving,that's confusing
06-03-2021T22:17:44,Twokinds,Hm...
06-03-2021T22:17:47,BadFoMo,"Fem_Trace: ...What does that mean, anyway? Do I have gas? it would explane why I've been feeling so bloated lately."
06-03-2021T22:18:01,Twokinds,I guess Euchre would hide it from Mary.
06-03-2021T22:18:03,Twokinds,Or...
06-03-2021T22:18:16,Twokinds,Maybe changing back and forth would prevent Raine from ever existing at all.
06-03-2021T22:18:18,ThingsAreMoving,"If we're genderswapping everyone, that includes Mary and Raine, too, right?"
06-03-2021T22:18:22,ProsePro7,Baby on a doorstep maybe
06-03-2021T22:18:23,Twokinds,Raine might not exist in the genderswap universe.
06-03-2021T22:18:31,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RaineEep:
06-03-2021T22:18:32,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-RaineEep:
06-03-2021T22:18:34,Zakuru,:ptv-uneasy:
06-03-2021T22:18:35,MuonNeutrino,depends what happens if a pregnant person shapeshifts
06-03-2021T22:18:37,ThingsAreMoving,:ctwokinds-RaineEep:
06-03-2021T22:18:46,Ordithus,this au suddenly is awful
06-03-2021T22:18:48,Ordithus,I hate it
06-03-2021T22:18:56,ProsePro7,And with a few words Tom creates a panic in the fandom
06-03-2021T22:18:58,CrRAR,this is a strange land
06-03-2021T22:19:02,MuonNeutrino,"though if mary could bear raine successfully despite raine shifting, it might be possible"
06-03-2021T22:19:38,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,:ctwokinds-RaineEep:
06-03-2021T22:19:40,BadFoMo,I don't know; shifting back and forth didn't stop Raine from exesting in the main comic.
06-03-2021T22:19:52,Roughlandin,Raine doesn't exist because it's her fanfic and she doesn't want a self insert
06-03-2021T22:19:56,MuonNeutrino,"i mean if raine was shifting minutes after she was born, she probably shifted at least a few times before that"
06-03-2021T22:20:00,MuonNeutrino,and it still worked
06-03-2021T22:20:35,Twokinds,I dunno
06-03-2021T22:21:00,BadFoMo,I like this song.
06-03-2021T22:21:04,Twokinds,Maybe femeuchre would remain with child regardless for form
06-03-2021T22:21:25,Roughlandin,"Also, kinda dark but... Did Trace lose her husband and miscarry her child in this version? That's... oof... that's rough."
06-03-2021T22:21:38,ThingsAreMoving,TK Multiverse
06-03-2021T22:21:40,Zakuru,"Maybe Euchre would feel different actually carrying Raine, Pregancny does stuff to women"
06-03-2021T22:21:51,ThingsAreMoving,You need more manpower for stuff like that
06-03-2021T22:21:58,MuonNeutrino,"@Roughlandin oh man, that would suck"
06-03-2021T22:22:06,MuonNeutrino,but make sense
06-03-2021T22:22:10,unsteddyphoenix,Or maybe Mary would have more mercy for her pregnant wife
06-03-2021T22:22:46,unsteddyphoenix,and Raine gets double parents
06-03-2021T22:23:03,BluePhantom90,So male Flora doesn't have Orange hair?
06-03-2021T22:23:14,Ordithus,":ctwokinds-rainehappy: so the one happy au, teddy"
06-03-2021T22:23:23,Zakuru,flora has brown hair XD
06-03-2021T22:23:33,Zakuru,she has orange fur..?
06-03-2021T22:23:35,MuonNeutrino,male flora doesn't seem to have much hair at all
06-03-2021T22:23:39,Dimensional,"Floor has no hair, only fur."
06-03-2021T22:23:54,KeefMcDerpface,We're still going with 'Floor'?
06-03-2021T22:23:54,BluePhantom90,sorry it looks orange to me. I am partly color blind
06-03-2021T22:24:07,Dimensional,I didn't know that joke had been used earlier.
06-03-2021T22:24:10,Ordithus,brown is a dark shade of orange :P
06-03-2021T22:24:27,MuonNeutrino,we still dont have a good name for male flora heh
06-03-2021T22:24:28,swack24,Florance
06-03-2021T22:24:39,MuonNeutrino,except that's confusing because tom has drawn the freefall character of that name before
06-03-2021T22:24:44,ThingsAreMoving,chocolate is dark orange?
06-03-2021T22:24:45,MuonNeutrino,several times
06-03-2021T22:24:50,ThingsAreMoving,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
06-03-2021T22:25:11,MuonNeutrino,interesting that fem-trace is still as tall as male-flora
06-03-2021T22:25:30,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Male Flora looks alot like a Tiger version of Mike.... :ctwokinds-floraquestion:
06-03-2021T22:25:31,BadFoMo,"Or Male_Mary (Marty?) puts both Raine and Eucher in the cabin, maybe going as far as to put a slave coller on Fem_Euchre that will keep her there."
06-03-2021T22:25:33,ProsePro7,Florenzo! [Castanets play]
06-03-2021T22:25:38,unsteddyphoenix,I think Flora grew and Trace shrunk
06-03-2021T22:25:43,unsteddyphoenix,So they ended the same height
06-03-2021T22:25:43,CrRAR,yup
06-03-2021T22:25:45,Twokinds,well Flora and Trace are usually drawn at the same height
06-03-2021T22:25:58,Twokinds,I always draw them about even
06-03-2021T22:26:05,unsteddyphoenix,No Tom I like my idea
06-03-2021T22:26:09,Dimensional,Ah.
06-03-2021T22:26:15,Roughlandin,Guy Flora lost size without the hair thingies
06-03-2021T22:26:21,Dimensional,Surprised Tracy isn't shorter
06-03-2021T22:26:21,KeefMcDerpface,hehe
06-03-2021T22:26:23,MuonNeutrino,yeah i was just half expecting that making flora male she'd get taller and making trace female he'd probably get shorter
06-03-2021T22:26:39,ProsePro7,Still males are on average bigger than females so either Tracy is tall or Florenzo is small
06-03-2021T22:26:41,unsteddyphoenix,I mean Flora is 5'2 and Trace is 5'8 normally
06-03-2021T22:26:45,MuonNeutrino,"not that that *has* to happen ofc, just was slightly surprised"
06-03-2021T22:26:51,Dimensional,Darn. I didn't think it was possible for Flora's chest to be even flatter. XP
06-03-2021T22:26:58,Twokinds,o_o
06-03-2021T22:27:04,Twokinds,Flora is 5'2??
06-03-2021T22:27:04,MuonNeutrino,hahahah
06-03-2021T22:27:09,ThingsAreMoving,lol
06-03-2021T22:27:16,Ordithus,Teddy your non-american is showing
06-03-2021T22:27:17,unsteddyphoenix,Oh 5'4 mb
06-03-2021T22:27:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Flora has an extra 5 inches of heel height
06-03-2021T22:27:24,ProsePro7,Tom forgetting his own lore
06-03-2021T22:27:29,Roughlandin,Smol girl
06-03-2021T22:27:34,MuonNeutrino,"you have her as 5'4"" on her ref sheet"

06-03-2021T22:38:08,KeefMcDerpface,I'm scare to click teddy's link...
06-03-2021T22:38:33,InTheLionsDen,Be afraid. Be very afraid.
06-03-2021T22:38:36,Ordithus,"despite everything, it actually works"
06-03-2021T22:38:47,KeefMcDerpface,Wait what?
06-03-2021T22:39:03,KeefMcDerpface,"Huh, it does."
06-03-2021T22:39:04,RimaDraws,stream is done?
06-03-2021T22:39:08,Ordithus,Yee
06-03-2021T22:39:08,Dimensional,Yup. Just finished.
06-03-2021T22:39:08,KeefMcDerpface,yep
06-03-2021T22:39:09,Roughlandin,Yep
06-03-2021T22:39:20,Dimensional,I had a laugh seeing my suggestion on there... :)
06-03-2021T22:39:32,InTheLionsDen,Still some sketches to go but Tom ran out of gas
06-03-2021T22:39:51,Roughlandin,He seemed tired today. He DID do like three streams over this week
06-03-2021T22:40:08,Dadrobit,I've only spent six months trying to get Undercover Maddie's Finale done. That's hardly not a winner.
06-03-2021T22:40:50,Ordithus,thinking I might switch it up and go for that Maren idea... it is my birthday this month anyways
06-03-2021T22:41:01,Roughlandin,Hmm... Do I go with Modern Flora jeans again or switch?
06-03-2021T22:41:02,CrRAR,whoop
06-03-2021T22:41:10,KeefMcDerpface,Happy Birthmonth!
06-03-2021T22:41:14,Ordithus,lotta competition for a mike and evals sketch right now anyways
06-03-2021T22:41:14,Dadrobit,"Happy birthday, Ord!"
06-03-2021T22:41:32,Ordithus,thanks! 24 more days
06-03-2021T22:41:38,Roughlandin,Keep the Mike going! March is Mike Madess!
06-03-2021T22:41:47,KeefMcDerpface,:stopwatch: :eyes:
06-03-2021T22:43:40,Roughlandin,I've also got a follow up idea for Brin and Hunky Snep. It's them packing for their next adventure while the villagers present Brin with her own honorary tail (replica) to mark her as an official member of the tribe
06-03-2021T22:43:54,KeefMcDerpface,awwwww
06-03-2021T22:44:30,Roughlandin,I really like it. I also like my Flora in too-small jeans idea though lol
06-03-2021T22:44:36,SpazztasticKiwi,o we done
06-03-2021T22:44:40,KeefMcDerpface,yep
06-03-2021T22:45:06,Roughlandin,Yep. Three more to go but Tom was worn out
06-03-2021T22:45:19,Roughlandin,"He did just finish color week and a comic page, though"
06-03-2021T22:45:25,Roughlandin,That's gotta ba taxing
06-03-2021T22:45:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm sold on the Flora with jeans idea if there‚Äôs a joke about no pockets too
06-03-2021T22:45:39,InTheLionsDen,And a Nora card
06-03-2021T22:45:55,Roughlandin,Also true
06-03-2021T22:46:34,Roughlandin,"Lol, Kiwi. ""These things are too small AND they have no pockets! Grrr!"""
06-03-2021T22:46:40,Dadrobit,"Man, quarantine has time all messed up. I legitimately cannot recall what I was doing with my life six months ago. I feel like things were happening, but time is all going together."
06-03-2021T22:46:57,Roughlandin,2020 felt like it lasted 3 years
06-03-2021T22:47:12,Ordithus,sure did
06-03-2021T22:47:33,Ordithus,a weird time
06-03-2021T22:47:59,ZapiliDver,back
06-03-2021T22:48:03,BadFoMo,Yo.
06-03-2021T22:48:08,Dadrobit,I was finishing my degree. That's about as much as I can recall.
06-03-2021T22:49:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I did fk all & gained weight
06-03-2021T22:49:21,BadFoMo,"That's better than my 'friend'; his brain is so fried, he can barally remember yesterday"
06-03-2021T22:49:27,BadFoMo,*.
06-03-2021T22:49:44,SpazztasticKiwi,anything beyond that is ‚ùì
06-03-2021T22:49:52,Twokinds,What happened yesterday?
06-03-2021T22:49:54,Twokinds,Where am I
06-03-2021T22:50:08,Ordithus,"same thing as the day before, and teh day before that"
06-03-2021T22:50:12,Ordithus,it's all the same
06-03-2021T22:50:15,Twokinds,Same as it ever was
06-03-2021T22:50:18,Twokinds,Same as it ever was
06-03-2021T22:50:26,Roughlandin,Water flowing underground
06-03-2021T22:50:46,BadFoMo,SSDD.
06-03-2021T22:50:57,Dadrobit,"Yes, weight is a problem as well. I federally need to start working out again, my job site is swapping back to short sleeves again, so I have nothing to hide what's left of my arms....."
06-03-2021T22:51:04,Roughlandin,This is not my beautiful house! This is not my beautiful Mike! I mean - wife!
06-03-2021T22:51:12,Dadrobit,Really* not federally
06-03-2021T22:51:33,Roughlandin,The federal fitness plan
06-03-2021T22:51:48,Dadrobit,It's quite taxing on the body.
06-03-2021T22:51:54,Roughlandin,Reminds me of those president's fitness tests I always failed in school
06-03-2021T22:51:57,SpazztasticKiwi,where the government takes 10% of your muscle mass when your done
06-03-2021T22:52:00,Roughlandin,lol
06-03-2021T22:52:23,ZapiliDver,I allow them to take 20% of my fat
06-03-2021T22:52:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm funny because being hot ain‚Äôt an option
06-03-2021T22:52:57,Roughlandin,Same. It works for Kevin James
06-03-2021T22:52:58,BadFoMo,"""The federal fitness plan"". Why is the Papers Please theme playing in my head?"
06-03-2021T22:53:11,SpazztasticKiwi,dEtAiNeD
06-03-2021T22:53:30,Dadrobit,"Either have six pack abs, be six foot tall, have a six figure income, or be really really funny."
06-03-2021T22:53:50,Roughlandin,Also reminds me of that time the Army recruiters came to our high school PE and tested us
06-03-2021T22:54:00,KeefMcDerpface,And?
06-03-2021T22:54:03,Roughlandin,"I was like, ""Guys... we both know you're not looking for me."""
06-03-2021T22:54:29,Roughlandin,"We got to the pull up section and I was like: ""...1. Okay I'm done."""
06-03-2021T22:54:33,BadFoMo,I'm not going ANYWHERE! /me gets hit in the head with the butt of a rifle.
06-03-2021T22:54:50,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I was in a full body cast the day the air force came to my school. I kinda have them vibes that I wasn't the man for the job lol."
06-03-2021T22:54:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I cannot do the pull up
06-03-2021T22:54:57,Dadrobit,Gave*
06-03-2021T22:55:06,Roughlandin,Oof Dad
06-03-2021T22:55:07,Ordithus,dad I'm sorry but I laughed at that
06-03-2021T22:55:12,SpazztasticKiwi,one arm is weaker than the other
06-03-2021T22:55:27,Dadrobit,"Like I said, be really really funny."
06-03-2021T22:55:28,SpazztasticKiwi,and it won‚Äôt bend up all the way unless forced
06-03-2021T22:55:46,BadFoMo,Full body cast?! How did that happen?!
06-03-2021T22:56:07,SpazztasticKiwi,the only thing I got going for me is the fat kinda blends in with me being bottom heavy
06-03-2021T22:56:25,Roughlandin,"We got to the timed run section and my guy was like, ""Did you do all the laps?"" and I was like, ""...Yeah. Let's just assume yeah."""
06-03-2021T22:56:35,Dadrobit,"I lost an inch putting me under 6 feet. My abs have been MIA for a year, and I'm a security guard supervisor, funny's all I got."
06-03-2021T22:56:50,SpazztasticKiwi,....how
06-03-2021T22:56:56,SpazztasticKiwi,how do you lose an inch
06-03-2021T22:57:05,SpazztasticKiwi,did a ton of bricks fall on your head
06-03-2021T22:57:17,Roughlandin,I actually got a gym membership with my friends at the start of last year. We were all doing really good till... everything happened.
06-03-2021T22:57:19,Lunarsprint,running is the devil bobby
06-03-2021T22:57:27,Dadrobit,Broke my back when I was 16. 6 vertebrae with compression fractures. Racing dirt bikes.
06-03-2021T22:57:34,Roughlandin,Ow
06-03-2021T22:58:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd say you can still go out walking but I did that today - hell I did it for several months ~3x a week
06-03-2021T22:58:19,Dadrobit,"So, Spazz, more or less exactly the same forces as a ton of bricks falling on my head."
06-03-2021T22:58:32,SpazztasticKiwi,nothing really budged
06-03-2021T22:58:49,Dadrobit,(walking is shit exercise for weight loss jsyk)
06-03-2021T22:58:53,Lunarsprint,fun then not fun I almost ripped out my own spine on a dirtbike luckily whatever sharp thing got me missed my spine and ribs somehow broke no bones
06-03-2021T22:59:11,Dadrobit,"Unless you're breathing heavy, you're not losing weight."
06-03-2021T22:59:15,Roughlandin,I need to cut out soda again. I stopped that last year and lost like 5 pounds just doing that alone
06-03-2021T22:59:34,SpazztasticKiwi,more activity was the key
06-03-2021T22:59:39,SpazztasticKiwi,it was 3-6 miles
06-03-2021T22:59:49,SpazztasticKiwi,and I didn‚Äôt always just walk
06-03-2021T23:00:04,Lunarsprint,but it makes me tired and aint fun
06-03-2021T23:00:17,Ordithus,I miss biking all the time
06-03-2021T23:00:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm fine as long as I have my phone
06-03-2021T23:00:32,Dadrobit,Breathing is literally how we lose weight. The carbon we breath out is the same stuff that was made from using energy stores.
06-03-2021T23:00:34,Lunarsprint,mm bmx and skate board
06-03-2021T23:01:04,ProsePro7,Welp I've stayed up way to late.  Night everyone.
06-03-2021T23:01:08,Ordithus,it was so easy to go for a 10 mile ride after work when I lived in minneapolis
06-03-2021T23:01:10,Roughlandin,Night Prose
06-03-2021T23:01:10,Dadrobit,o/ prose
06-03-2021T23:01:11,SpazztasticKiwi,so breathing heavier I‚Äôll lose the weight
06-03-2021T23:01:11,Ordithus,so many trails
06-03-2021T23:01:13,Ordithus,night prose

06-03-2021T23:01:18,ProsePro7,signs off
06-03-2021T23:01:24,SpazztasticKiwi,that makes little sense
06-03-2021T23:01:52,Dadrobit,Breathing heavier without excising carbon will just get you oxygen high.
06-03-2021T23:01:59,Ordithus,cardio
06-03-2021T23:02:32,Roughlandin,Actually it'll make you hypoxic. Hyperventilating makes you reinhale your own carbon dioxide
06-03-2021T23:03:09,Ordithus,and then you go fwomp
06-03-2021T23:03:22,Roughlandin,Eyup
06-03-2021T23:04:01,Roughlandin,Woof. It's already 11. I better do some homework before bed.
06-03-2021T23:04:09,Roughlandin,Night everybody! See ya next week!
06-03-2021T23:04:19,Roughlandin,Thanks for streaming Tom!
06-03-2021T23:04:19,Ordithus,night rough
06-03-2021T23:04:27,KeefMcDerpface,night Rough
06-03-2021T23:04:33,SpazztasticKiwi,activity makes you burn fat after a certain time
06-03-2021T23:04:34,Dadrobit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM-ySWyID9o Here's a pretty fun video on it.
06-03-2021T23:04:45,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs not the breathing
06-03-2021T23:06:10,Dadrobit,About 80% of weight loss is carbon being excised through breathing.
06-03-2021T23:06:51,Ordithus,"oxygen and fat make carbon dioxide and water. you breathe, sweat, and pee it out"
06-03-2021T23:07:00,Dadrobit,"S'why if you're using a lot of energy, your body tries to get rid of the excess carbon that much faster with faster and hearder breathing."
06-03-2021T23:08:03,SpazztasticKiwi,& yet I manage to stay 157 with the lifting and movement I do at work
06-03-2021T23:09:47,SpazztasticKiwi,the only consolation from revisiting the dr was I proved the 163 they clocked me at wasn‚Äôt completely true because of my steel toe work boots
06-03-2021T23:10:22,SpazztasticKiwi,either I lost 6 pounds in a little under a week or those things are heavy
06-03-2021T23:11:48,Ordithus,steel toe boots are heavy yes
06-03-2021T23:33:18,Ordithus,56 on tuesday :cw0lfmare-EmberO:
