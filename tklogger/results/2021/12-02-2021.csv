12-02-2021T17:51:25,SpazztasticKiwi,thou shalt not lay a hand on the cats either
12-02-2021T17:53:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not sure if I’d be able to find the video but a man was arrested for animal cruelty when he had a disagreement with his girlfriend & she told him to leave through her ring camera
12-02-2021T17:53:29,SpazztasticKiwi,& he decided to pick the dog up by its collar in front of her
12-02-2021T17:54:13,CrRAR,poor dog
12-02-2021T17:54:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"you best pray the cops get there before I do because at that point, you’re rose fertilizer if I get to you"
12-02-2021T17:54:57,CrRAR,right?
12-02-2021T17:55:40,CrRAR,"""I wasn't even gonna bother wasting time coming out before, but now I am... to kill you."""
12-02-2021T17:55:59,SpazztasticKiwi,she was at work at the time
12-02-2021T17:56:06,SpazztasticKiwi,he was there to walk the dog
12-02-2021T17:56:07,CrRAR,ohhh
12-02-2021T17:56:21,CrRAR,wow that's extra cruel
12-02-2021T17:56:33,SpazztasticKiwi,pray that the cops get there first
12-02-2021T17:56:47,SpazztasticKiwi,because I won’t leave enough to be identifiable
12-02-2021T17:57:02,CrRAR,"""I'm at your house terrorizing you AND your pets"""
12-02-2021T17:57:16,CrRAR,yeah that's probably good enough claim for a restraining order
12-02-2021T17:57:33,SpazztasticKiwi,he went to jail for the animal cruelty
12-02-2021T17:57:39,CrRAR,good
12-02-2021T17:57:48,SpazztasticKiwi,restraining order wasn’t necessary
12-02-2021T17:58:10,SpazztasticKiwi,the cops got him when she sent them & there was the evidence
12-02-2021T17:58:21,SpazztasticKiwi,dumb enough to do it on a recording device
12-02-2021T17:58:26,CrRAR,should have been like a automatic thing tho
12-02-2021T17:58:28,SpazztasticKiwi,in plain view
12-02-2021T17:58:41,CrRAR,yeah the number of dumb things that happen on camera now is astounding
12-02-2021T17:59:33,SpazztasticKiwi,advanced stupid
12-02-2021T17:59:40,CrRAR,"crime never paid, and now idiots just volunteer to be on camera doing arrest able offences"
12-02-2021T18:00:29,CrRAR,it really kinda shows that A LOT of crimes are people just acting out emotions they can't cope with on their own
12-02-2021T18:00:56,CrRAR,"cuz a reasonable person would be like ""I should be good, cuz otherwise I'll look like a psycho"""
12-02-2021T18:01:05,CrRAR,"""AND probably go to jail"""
12-02-2021T18:01:25,CrRAR,"""realllyyy should avoid that"""

12-02-2021T18:16:57,CrRAR,...and himself.
12-02-2021T18:19:50,CrRAR,a little credit for at least trying tho
