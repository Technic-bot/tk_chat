26-01-2021T19:34:05,AspiringNoodle,"Rich person smoking a $100: ""Oh, you lost your money?  Ohohoho, just learn to play the game better!"""
26-01-2021T19:34:52,AspiringNoodle,"*the masses cause rich people to lose over $2,000,000,000*"
26-01-2021T19:35:08,AspiringNoodle,"Rich person: ""That's it, we're shutting this down, halt all trading."""
26-01-2021T19:35:30,AspiringNoodle,But isn't that always how it is?
26-01-2021T19:35:41,AspiringNoodle,"When in control: ""Play better."" or ""Make your own."""
26-01-2021T19:35:57,AspiringNoodle,People: *do as mentioned above and start winning*
26-01-2021T19:36:07,AspiringNoodle,"People losing control: ""That's it, you're done."""
26-01-2021T19:43:36,CrRAR,however much I want to believe it's all wsb's doing... then why never before though?
26-01-2021T19:44:06,CrRAR,I honestly think something more funny is happening and they're being used as a 'usual suspect'
26-01-2021T19:44:49,CrRAR,"cuz like if it was just them, then why not manipulate more to that insane degree?"
26-01-2021T19:50:07,CrRAR,"I feel like 3000% gains are just a bit more than they would be capable of, maybe some bitcoin whales are tossing around insane fortunes behind all this."
26-01-2021T19:51:29,CrRAR,"tbh, I wouldn't be surprised IF the SEC or whatever linked that kind of manipulation to a certain internet community, they might seem to censor them."
26-01-2021T19:51:40,CrRAR,*seek
26-01-2021T19:52:25,CrRAR,"would suck if wsb just became the innocent fall guys sitting around claiming credit, get the SEC banhammer xD"
26-01-2021T19:59:11,CrRAR,"like, I think about it too, all the talk of cryptos and speculation, reddit has never been able to coordinate price control of an asset like that... and I feel like cryptos especially early on would have been easier to influence by simple 'mob mentality'"
26-01-2021T20:09:07,AspiringNoodle,"From what I understand, it wasn't just mass investment"
26-01-2021T20:09:35,AspiringNoodle,It was mass investment as hedge fund managers were getting ready for the stock prices to fall
26-01-2021T20:09:50,AspiringNoodle,It's something stupidly specific to how hedge fund managers make money for themselves / clients
26-01-2021T20:10:17,AspiringNoodle,"And basically, WSB got people to invest and raise stock prices, which created a positive feedback loop"
26-01-2021T20:10:38,AspiringNoodle,And the managers did what they normally do because of the plans they had to do
26-01-2021T20:10:59,AspiringNoodle,Which ended in the net result of hedge fund managers losing over $2B
26-01-2021T20:14:02,CrRAR,"yeah it has to do with betting the stock would continue to do bad, because basically that's what it is predicted/known to do"
26-01-2021T20:14:12,AspiringNoodle,And reddit mucked it up
26-01-2021T20:14:21,AspiringNoodle,And now the rich people aren't happy because *gasp* they LOST MONEY!!!
26-01-2021T20:15:07,CrRAR,"kinda like how in the mortgage crisis big institutions were making money selling insurance backed by the fact that ""mortgages never fail"""

26-01-2021T22:13:09,CrRAR,it is complete sloppiness if there dozens of other stocks with exposed positions like that

26-01-2021T22:22:58,AspiringNoodle,They did exactly what hedge fund managers do on the daily.
26-01-2021T22:23:19,AspiringNoodle,"Only this time, the rich people lost all the money and the working class made all the money :p"
26-01-2021T22:30:35,CrRAR,yeah it‚Äôs like a racket they have going being the brokers of stock they somewhat know is a losing stock so they sell it to someone ‚Äòknowing‚Äô the price is likely to drop meaning when they buy it back they only have to give the ‚Äòloser‚Äô market value
26-01-2021T22:31:04,CrRAR,What‚Äôs happening is just an attack on the market of exploitation they have going
26-01-2021T22:31:25,CrRAR,...just by running up the cost.
26-01-2021T22:35:01,CrRAR,"It‚Äôs like them running a carnival game, but now all the ‚Äòlosers‚Äô are winners and they owe them the value of a house xD"
26-01-2021T22:40:33,AspiringNoodle,"Yup, soooooo, zero sympathy for the people who lost money :P"
26-01-2021T22:40:48,AspiringNoodle,"And considering another round of stimulus checks is coming, you just know they're gonna try doing this again"
26-01-2021T22:41:05,CrRAR,lol
26-01-2021T22:42:13,CrRAR,It happening once feels like a proof-of-concept almost first-salvo to me
26-01-2021T22:42:49,CrRAR,Like stock prices running up has been occuring naturally pretty often lately
26-01-2021T22:43:28,CrRAR,Of course though the ‚Äòlandmines‚Äô ones are ones that have been statistically chosen to remain bad though
26-01-2021T22:44:05,CrRAR,It‚Äôs like reddit turned the stockmarket into a giant game of minesweeper
26-01-2021T22:44:33,CrRAR,way to go lol
26-01-2021T22:47:53,CrRAR,...or maybe Battleship is the better analogy game.
