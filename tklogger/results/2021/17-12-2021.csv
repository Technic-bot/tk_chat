17-12-2021T03:00:49,SageSaga,so when they get the fake cult leader to reveal his true form- he legit looks like an actual other cult leader-

17-12-2021T03:05:50,Dadrobit,I was seriously doubting myself for a sec there.
17-12-2021T03:06:55,SageSaga,its funny because i found the version i had looking for the song they did at the Olympics- which i still cant find-
17-12-2021T03:07:38,SageSaga,but they did a song at one of the Olympics that was awesome- dont know who wrote that one- but ive since forgotten it and dont remember it well enough to know it if i heard it XD
17-12-2021T03:09:55,Dadrobit,"Yeah, pretty sure that was it, but iirc the one I was thinking had Hatsune Miku and was a slower version. "

17-12-2021T15:58:10,SageSaga,why have you done this?
17-12-2021T15:58:40,ZapiliDver,i've listened to Ron yesterday =)
17-12-2021T15:59:50,ZapiliDver,but if you really hate this curse i will remove it
17-12-2021T15:59:51,SageSaga,a landslide of mistakes then
17-12-2021T16:00:27,ZapiliDver,"yep, it's hard to edit with command line tools and paintbrush + ffmpeg"
17-12-2021T16:01:03,ZapiliDver,"so, keep it or delete?"
17-12-2021T16:01:51,SageSaga,follow your heart- or your brain- one of those two
17-12-2021T16:02:39,ZapiliDver,"well, whiteshow artefacts lead to delete, i have no idea why ffmpeg inserts them"
17-12-2021T16:03:21,AspiringNoodle,"Sage, I got two links I would like to share.  The one is to a twitter thread giving a rough rundown of the situation, and the other is a petition asking for a man's sentence to be commuted or given clemency.  Is there any issues with posting it?"
17-12-2021T16:04:29,SageSaga,normal rules apply to linking
17-12-2021T16:05:50,AspiringNoodle,"Truck driver given 110-year sentence for accident caused by faulty breaks that killed 4, injured 27: https://twitter.com/i/events/1472270438529077248"
17-12-2021T16:06:04,AspiringNoodle,Petition asking for commutation or clemency: https://chng.it/4pQLXDFW5F
17-12-2021T16:08:03,CrRAR,Was he an owner-operator?
17-12-2021T16:08:29,CrRAR,part of the CDL liability is ensuring the fitness of your vehicle before every drive
17-12-2021T16:08:30,AspiringNoodle,"No, he worked for a company that's had several mechanical violations during inspections since 2017"
17-12-2021T16:08:39,CrRAR,ah that sucks
17-12-2021T16:09:56,CrRAR,"might be that the company is acting all ""they're (the employees) are driving our lousy trucks it's their call"" which is REALLY bad stance from an employer obviously"
17-12-2021T16:10:19,CrRAR,it might make for a legal like grey area
17-12-2021T16:10:56,CrRAR,I mean I'm guessing the court case determined negligence or something?
17-12-2021T16:11:49,CrRAR,"because I can see the prosecution proving someone knew there was problems then being like, ""Well then... you chose to continue operating the truck anyway?"""
17-12-2021T16:12:17,CrRAR,so whoever that falls on operator or business is whoever would admit it I guess
17-12-2021T16:12:28,AspiringNoodle,I think the bigger issue is that he's being charged regardless of the fact that he had a mechanical failure of his vehicle.  And the laws are absurdly outdated.
17-12-2021T16:13:30,AspiringNoodle,"His options at the time were either crash into a semi parked on the shoulder, which was his only escape route, or continue on with the highway traffic"
17-12-2021T16:13:56,CrRAR,"yeah, mechanical breakdowns can almost always be random, hence why trucks being stranded is always still a sight occationally"
17-12-2021T16:13:57,AspiringNoodle,"And because of the way Colorado's laws are written, the court is required to give him a mandatory minimum sentence per charge."
17-12-2021T16:14:13,CrRAR,no one can ever predict something suddenly 
17-12-2021T16:14:18,SageSaga,and you got all this info from a court report and professionals talking about it- or a bunch of people on twitter?
17-12-2021T16:14:20,AspiringNoodle,They are also going to be appealing on the grounds that the trial made some mistakes
17-12-2021T16:14:24,MysticWav,I wonder why they don't mandate putting backup systems on things as dangerous as trucks.
17-12-2021T16:14:56,AspiringNoodle,This is from what I've dug up on initial glance. 
17-12-2021T16:15:28,CrRAR,"yeah, this is why unions and good lawyers are important"
17-12-2021T16:15:49,AspiringNoodle,"He was operating the vehicle when the crash occurred.  But the crash occurred due to mechanical failure.  As far as I know, Rogel was *not* responsible for maintenance of the vehicle, but the company he worked for, and the company has past violations"
17-12-2021T16:15:56,CrRAR,a union would provide occupational defense for something like that
17-12-2021T16:16:05,CrRAR,to protect the right party
17-12-2021T16:16:17,CrRAR,best they can etc
17-12-2021T16:16:57,AspiringNoodle,"As it stands, all the charges are related to the pile-up that was caused because of the part failure."
17-12-2021T16:17:03,SageSaga,was it judge or jury?
17-12-2021T16:17:51,AspiringNoodle,"I'm looking now.  I believe it was jury.  The judge expresses regret at the sentence, but his hands are tied by Colorado law."
17-12-2021T16:18:34,CrRAR,"I do know that CDL licencenture expects a driver to do a pre-trip check of all major systems on a tractor trailer. I assume there are things that wouldn't be caught, but also maintenance would HOPEFULLY be logged and performed as needed by an employer"
17-12-2021T16:18:53,SageSaga,thats kinda bullcrap- Judges have a lot of influence on that kinda stuff- unless its minimal sentencing i think but then there is extenuating circumstances 
17-12-2021T16:19:24,Twokinds,"I personally don't think people should be given long jail terms for unintentional acts, even if it is negligence. 100+ years is just revenge. They want to end his life for what happened, just the long way."
17-12-2021T16:19:56,CrRAR,"honestly, may have come down to a bad defense attorney "
17-12-2021T16:20:26,SageSaga,yeah which is why i think there has to be more to it than this- because a Jury is very unlikely to convict a person who they see as not at fault for 100 years
17-12-2021T16:20:32,CrRAR,maybe on-appeal they'll see some sense
17-12-2021T16:20:37,SageSaga,juries do NOT like sending people to their death
17-12-2021T16:20:51,AspiringNoodle,Supposedly he did make some mistakes prior to the accident.  But I want to call BS.
17-12-2021T16:21:02,SageSaga,you have to be a monster to convince 12 people that someone needs to die
17-12-2021T16:21:19,AspiringNoodle,"They say he passed a runaway truck ramp prior to the accident, but my question is, ""was he aware of the brake failure at that point?"""
17-12-2021T16:22:01,AspiringNoodle,"That said, there are lawyers pointing to case law where his sentence could be reduced to a minimum 20 years.  And that's probably what the appeal will aim for it not outright innocence."
17-12-2021T16:22:09,SageSaga,they should have answered that
17-12-2021T16:22:27,AspiringNoodle,It's worth pointing out that Rogel did not hide or run after the accident.
17-12-2021T16:22:59,SageSaga,thats not worth pointing out tbh
17-12-2021T16:23:05,CrRAR,"runaway truck ramps are a wild concept, I've seen them in northern NH they literally looks like a gravelly runway fork off a steep downhill stretch "
17-12-2021T16:23:16,SageSaga,most people wouldnt- shock doesnt usually lead people to run
17-12-2021T16:23:34,AspiringNoodle,"Well, here's a little gem from the twitter thread"
17-12-2021T16:23:45,AspiringNoodle,"""Ethan Couch killed 4 people while driving drunk; his BAC was 0.24. He fled the country. He was only given 10 years probation, & then 720 days in jail for violating his probation.

Rogel Aguilera-Mederos was sentenced 110 years for an accident killing "
17-12-2021T16:23:49,AspiringNoodle,"4 because his brakes failed."""
17-12-2021T16:24:17,SageSaga,not really relevant
17-12-2021T16:24:27,CrRAR,"yeah, the issue is a good lawyer would have fought the argument before the actual results of the accident"
17-12-2021T16:24:42,CrRAR,like the circumstances of liability
17-12-2021T16:25:02,SageSaga,yeah my guess is - the drive was liable 
17-12-2021T16:25:08,CrRAR,"not ""eh, he did it and he didn't run... he's a good guy!"""
17-12-2021T16:25:28,CrRAR,"airbrakes are interesting, they deplete as you use them"
17-12-2021T16:25:54,CrRAR,so on a down hill portion you only have so much braking before failure
17-12-2021T16:26:06,CrRAR,they literally have to recharge
17-12-2021T16:26:33,CrRAR,that's why emergency pulloffs exist like runways for trucks
17-12-2021T16:26:45,AspiringNoodle,"In any case, Colorado got a bit of a problem on its hands"
17-12-2021T16:26:58,AspiringNoodle,Truckers are boycotting the state over the sentence
17-12-2021T16:27:09,ZapiliDver,Any country has it's own stupid laws.
17-12-2021T16:27:21,CrRAR,it's a judgement call if your breaks will survive a downhill portion you have to take into account road grade and load of the trailer
17-12-2021T16:27:52,CrRAR,so there is some 'math' involved that is the drivers discretion
17-12-2021T16:27:58,AspiringNoodle,The reason the crash was so deadly was that there was stopped traffic on the highway
17-12-2021T16:28:59,CrRAR,"it could very well be the driver didn't call the factors right, thought he'd be okay, and then ran out of air brake capacity"
17-12-2021T16:29:30,AspiringNoodle,"In any case, I do believe that Colorado's laws are horribly outdated."
17-12-2021T16:31:03,AspiringNoodle,"And for those curious, the original petition was started by a Colorado woman who has no ties to Rogel."
17-12-2021T16:31:38,SageSaga,also doesnt really matter
17-12-2021T16:31:55,AspiringNoodle,Just a small footnote. 
17-12-2021T16:31:58,CrRAR,"It could be like in the NFL like some 'roughing the passer' calls seem strict when someone bumps a QB for a flag and people go ""But he HAS to tackle him!"" the point of the rule is just to discourage the worst of outcomes"
17-12-2021T16:32:07,ZapiliDver,"BTW in RU, if you will hit person with your car/moto while driving you will pay for it's healthcare and compensate all that he may loss, even if he is 100% guilty in that (i.e. If he jump right before your car to commit a suicide - you will be right, but "
17-12-2021T16:32:21,CrRAR,oh yeah I heard that zap!
17-12-2021T16:32:41,CrRAR,reason why so many dashcam vids from the RU exist! xD
17-12-2021T16:33:04,CrRAR,it's to prove in the event the actual circumstances of the collisions
17-12-2021T16:33:17,AspiringNoodle,Ugh... so many cringe-inducing fraud incidents
17-12-2021T16:33:19,CrRAR,"no 'he says, she says'"
17-12-2021T16:33:40,AspiringNoodle,"Have you seen how many of those dumbasses walk in front of a car, and lazily fall onto it and then act like they got hit?"
17-12-2021T16:33:42,ZapiliDver,"Anyway you will pay for all shit that will be required to bring him back to working condition, or to send him to coffin"
17-12-2021T16:34:01,ZapiliDver,becouse you are driving high-risk device - car/moto.
17-12-2021T16:34:40,CrRAR,"yup, always remember ""driving - a PRIVILEGE not a right!"""
17-12-2021T16:34:53,CrRAR,"be smart out there, fam"
17-12-2021T16:36:03,CrRAR,"also noodle, being CO it probably keeps the law or at least persisted maybe because so many damn mountain passes lead to lots of high-risk situations like this."
17-12-2021T16:36:17,SageSaga,"but owning a device that is built to kill just about anything in the world- thats a right! It doesnt take you from destination to destination, it doesnt help you in most work situations, it most often lands people in jail, but its a right!"
17-12-2021T16:36:52,CrRAR,cuz if a runaway truck ramps was involved I guarantee you it must have been a severe downhill portion
17-12-2021T16:37:08,CrRAR,lol sage!

17-12-2021T16:38:32,CrRAR,you have a right to bear arms!
17-12-2021T16:38:34,AspiringNoodle,I believe it does.  Let me check

17-12-2021T16:41:10,SageSaga,i need to open carry a zweihander 
17-12-2021T16:41:11,AspiringNoodle,BUT carrying / use can be dictated by local laws

17-12-2021T16:42:12,AspiringNoodle,Yes.
17-12-2021T16:42:28,CrRAR,I feel like above a 2-3 inch blade or something?
17-12-2021T16:42:34,SageSaga,i cant conceal a zweihander-
17-12-2021T16:42:46,AspiringNoodle,That will depend on the state

17-12-2021T16:51:55,AspiringNoodle,Not that I can recall.
17-12-2021T16:52:13,CrRAR,plot twist: all tests were trick tests
17-12-2021T16:52:16,SageSaga,its a test to make people realize how important it is to read directions

17-12-2021T16:52:55,CrRAR,maybe the notes aren't like front and center on the app?
17-12-2021T16:53:19,CrRAR,or they're hoping to be nicer for a better review or tip or something?
17-12-2021T16:53:37,SageSaga,i think this delivery person either never had it or didnt learn anything from that test

17-12-2021T17:22:24,ZapiliDver,eveh i still have a half of brakes it was a real stress
17-12-2021T17:22:30,ZapiliDver,for the first time
17-12-2021T17:23:48,CrRAR,"yeah tbf also many people would think emergency brake in a car, but at speed E-brakes are horribly unpredictable"
17-12-2021T17:24:07,CrRAR,really should only be called the parking brake
17-12-2021T17:24:23,CrRAR,actually sucks in an actual emergency
17-12-2021T17:24:48,ZapiliDver,"you can use that ""handbrake"" as a brake, but only at speeds like 10mph or less"
17-12-2021T17:25:36,CrRAR,if down shifting is still a possibility in a car your best bet is use that by downshifting to a lower speed then use e-brake when you're as slow as you can get
17-12-2021T17:25:49,ZapiliDver,yep
