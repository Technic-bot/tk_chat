02-01-2021T18:08:14,MarkovPolo,It's like $19k for the whole year which is two semesters so it's like $9.5k/semester

02-01-2021T19:27:52,Doomkid666,Hi Tommy
02-01-2021T19:28:05,FenceEqualizer,Derpy Reni is fine too.
02-01-2021T19:28:13,MarkovPolo,hey random question: can reni magic up clothes yet
02-01-2021T19:28:20,FenceEqualizer,Gonna miss the day when Team A and B moves on and we get less Reni
02-01-2021T19:28:34,MarkovPolo,'cuz if not going back into town to replace the ones the fauxneys destroyed is gonna be...awkward for her
02-01-2021T19:28:35,microbuss,me too
02-01-2021T19:28:36,CrimsonQuill,I want to see her tag along
02-01-2021T19:29:44,FenceEqualizer,I would too but I can't see her having much reason to join the party yet.
02-01-2021T19:30:08,84Animations,neat
02-01-2021T19:30:39,MarkovPolo,i have a lot of questions about how dragon magic works tbh
02-01-2021T19:30:51,MarkovPolo,especially the shapeshifting
02-01-2021T19:31:11,84Animations,same
02-01-2021T19:31:18,MarkovPolo,like lets say cat nora got down and dirty with some random cat keidran

02-01-2021T19:31:42,Twokinds,Reni can't magic clothes
02-01-2021T19:31:43,MarkovPolo,could she get pregonate? and if she did would the kids be normal cat keidran themselves?
02-01-2021T19:31:47,Twokinds,That's why she had to go away to change.
02-01-2021T19:31:58,Doomkid666,It'll be hilarious to see crossover between two kinds and Hotline Miami
02-01-2021T19:32:02,GammaEradon,"Heh, convenient~"
02-01-2021T19:32:13,MarkovPolo,or is it a thing where the child of a dragon is always a dragon or something?
02-01-2021T19:32:27,FenceEqualizer,True Robit. That's the best part about streams
02-01-2021T19:32:28,CrRAR,I think that's the case
02-01-2021T19:32:34,FenceEqualizer,Keeps characters alive. Like Laura.
02-01-2021T19:32:39,CrRAR,dragons beget dragons
02-01-2021T19:32:45,Ordithus,"And Alaric, rarely"
02-01-2021T19:33:28,MarkovPolo,"And if dragons always beget dragons, are they immune to species boundaries no matter what form they're in?"
02-01-2021T19:33:38,MarkovPolo,"Like, could cat nora have a kid with a human/basitin?"
02-01-2021T19:33:51,Doomkid666,Tony meets Flora
02-01-2021T19:34:28,MarkovPolo,"'cuz if so, there could be a whacky premise there with a non-dragon and a dragon in disguise"

02-01-2021T20:12:56,ProsePro7,Does anyone else hear Reni in their head as posh British in accent?
02-01-2021T20:13:06,Brocade,one of my favorite Reni scenes is still where she's prepared for battle and the Adrakist shows up
02-01-2021T20:13:09,Ordithus,"give her a few generations of best friends dying, she can be cold and bitter too"
02-01-2021T20:13:18,CrimsonQuill,That puts a whole different layer onto her

02-01-2021T23:46:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Se√°n had to sit down for a break
02-01-2021T23:46:27,SpazztasticKiwi,old men
02-01-2021T23:46:32,KeefMcDerpface,Playing in VR?

02-01-2021T23:46:37,SpazztasticKiwi,yeah
02-01-2021T23:46:41,BlackjackSec99,"man, if he almost got sick in Beat Saber, then he should NOT play Ultrawings"
02-01-2021T23:46:48,CrimsonQuill,It's done
02-01-2021T23:46:48,BlackjackSec99,"keef, yes"

02-01-2021T23:47:10,Roughlandin,"Hit the sheets, man!"
02-01-2021T23:47:12,SpazztasticKiwi,it was a combination of the vr movement & cardio I think
02-01-2021T23:47:18,KeefMcDerpface,"Yeah, I know what Beat Saber is."
02-01-2021T23:47:22,SpazztasticKiwi,he took the headset off & felt better
02-01-2021T23:47:31,CrimsonQuill,"Goodnight everyone...or rather, good morning...time to grab my teddy bear"
02-01-2021T23:47:33,CrimsonQuill,Sleep well

02-01-2021T23:48:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Se√°n was so winded on one video he was wheezing
02-01-2021T23:48:21,KeefMcDerpface,"Last I checked, Through the Fires and the Flames was the toughest 'level' in the game."
02-01-2021T23:48:23,Roughlandin,Mark has problems with vertigo in VR anyway
02-01-2021T23:48:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"of course, he has asthma so"

02-01-2021T23:49:32,BlackjackSec99,the only things that get me are when you use the controlers to move or when doing combat in Elite Dangerous
02-01-2021T23:49:52,Ordithus,"only done vr once, was fun"
02-01-2021T23:49:56,SpazztasticKiwi,üß†: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt like that‚Äù

02-01-2021T23:52:46,BlackjackSec99,"the one downside to VR that wont be able to be removed, you just have to deal with it."
02-01-2021T23:52:57,BlackjackSec99,Till we get full dive tech anyway.
02-01-2021T23:53:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel like me standing up in vr would be asking for chaos
02-01-2021T23:53:27,KeefMcDerpface,"""Brain."" ""Yeah?"" ""IT'S NOT REAL!!"""

02-01-2021T23:59:21,Roughlandin,And it wasn't like he was being super creepy. Just... kinda forward
02-01-2021T23:59:22,Ordithus,use the / ignore command. can also let me/teddy know. might not do anything without evidence but if a few people speak up
