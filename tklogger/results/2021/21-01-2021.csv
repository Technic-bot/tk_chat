21-01-2021T00:17:51,SpaceCadety,Clovis seems like he really doesn't know what to do with feelings of friendship.
21-01-2021T00:18:21,SpaceCadety,Which is really kind of sad.
21-01-2021T00:23:07,CrRAR,"He does sort of conclude that “because I like you so much, you’re sorta l liability making me come all the way down here”"
21-01-2021T00:23:12,CrRAR,*hugs*
21-01-2021T00:23:58,CrRAR,“Aren’t I so great I risked my valuable self to come down here and rescue you fluff boy”

21-01-2021T00:24:54,SpaceCadety,I wonder if Nora would have just toasted him back in Dragon Masquerade if he was an irredeemable monster.
21-01-2021T00:36:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a face peel on
21-01-2021T00:37:04,CrRAR,:ptv-confused:

21-01-2021T00:39:24,CrRAR,Moisture sealing~
21-01-2021T00:40:59,SpazztasticKiwi,not good for beards

21-01-2021T00:41:09,SpazztasticKiwi,or hair at all
21-01-2021T00:41:25,SpazztasticKiwi,but good for taking that top layer- or 2 - of skin
21-01-2021T00:41:31,SpazztasticKiwi,and the little face hairs
21-01-2021T00:42:36,CrRAR,"reveals only the most tender, squishy layers"

21-01-2021T00:46:50,CrRAR,nite ord
21-01-2021T00:47:36,SpazztasticKiwi,it can be
21-01-2021T00:48:00,SpazztasticKiwi,some you have to layer thicker or it’s just a light top cleaning
21-01-2021T00:48:15,SpazztasticKiwi,others can be laid thin and take out hair and skin
21-01-2021T00:48:35,SpazztasticKiwi,and some peal off like nothing
21-01-2021T00:48:41,CrRAR,"Ah, does how much you let it dry matter?"
21-01-2021T00:48:56,SpazztasticKiwi,if it’s thick ya
21-01-2021T00:49:15,CrRAR,I see
21-01-2021T00:49:19,SpazztasticKiwi,more clay means it has to sit longer or else it’s not pealing anything off
21-01-2021T00:49:28,SpazztasticKiwi,you’re just washing your face with it
21-01-2021T00:49:47,SpazztasticKiwi,in which case there’s scrubs for that

21-01-2021T22:54:34,0crop,Bye Nekonny and Ron
21-01-2021T22:55:25,Roughlandin,"Ooh. Active pose, Tom"
21-01-2021T22:55:26,ChromaticBard,"I am becoming increasingly more scared for my players as my campaign goes on. They get closer and closer to fully catching the attention and angering the king of liches, who also happens to be one of the player's warlock patron"
21-01-2021T22:55:31,0crop,Nice sketch (referring to previous one)
21-01-2021T22:56:05,SageSaga,like i said- Tom would likely not be able to play- so i would have his NPC practically be a recluse only to be called on for emergencies he had the skills for - and probably reluctantly so :P
21-01-2021T22:56:07,Roughlandin,"Warlock patrons never really turn out well, do they?"
21-01-2021T22:56:16,ChromaticBard,Most of the time they don't
21-01-2021T22:56:31,SageSaga,there are Celestial Pact Warlocks
21-01-2021T22:57:09,ChromaticBard,"My singular warlock character should probably Lawful Good, and is a warlock for the Wildmother"
21-01-2021T22:57:17,Roughlandin,"Hmm. What's the difference between that and a Paladin, though?"
21-01-2021T22:57:29,SageSaga,a lot
21-01-2021T22:57:45,ChromaticBard,A lot
21-01-2021T22:57:52,SageSaga,where do i even start- i guess we can start with not all paladins get power from celestials at all
21-01-2021T22:57:58,SageSaga,some are paladins of an ideal
21-01-2021T22:58:48,0crop,"Well, I think I'm going off for breakfast. Hopefully be back soon™"
21-01-2021T22:58:52,Ordithus,brb
21-01-2021T22:59:00,SageSaga,celestials include creatures like Unicorns and Couatl
21-01-2021T22:59:21,SageSaga,and of course Angels and Devas- and they dont have to be associated with a god
21-01-2021T22:59:50,ChromaticBard,"And of course if you got really spicy, you could be a paladin for a demonic cult"
21-01-2021T23:00:28,ChromaticBard,"Ok, that only helps show they are more similar :p"
21-01-2021T23:00:38,SageSaga,a paladin has devoted themselves to an oath while a Warlock has just made a deal
21-01-2021T23:00:59,Roughlandin,Ah. That's a good way to put it
21-01-2021T23:01:29,SageSaga,you can be a good person and make a deal with a fiend for power
21-01-2021T23:01:36,ChromaticBard,Yep
21-01-2021T23:01:50,SageSaga,and so long as the deal doesnt force you to do something evil- you arent evil for doing so
21-01-2021T23:02:12,SageSaga,and they will often make such deals - if it screws with another fiends plans that they dont like too
21-01-2021T23:02:23,Roughlandin,Oh no. I wasn't saying warlocks were evil
21-01-2021T23:02:37,SageSaga,i never said you did
21-01-2021T23:03:12,SageSaga,however if a Paladin makes an oath to something evil- he will be committing evil acts
21-01-2021T23:03:42,SageSaga,warlocks are not bound by the will of their Patron- its a negotiation for power for services
21-01-2021T23:04:29,ChromaticBard,"The warlock I mentioned in my campaign definitely has good morals. He made the pact in order to bring back a friend who died, and hates having to work for his patron"
21-01-2021T23:04:57,SageSaga,one of my warlocks thought he was a cleric :P
21-01-2021T23:05:03,ChromaticBard,"There are two other warlocks, a hexblade, and another that multiclassed into warlock after being confronted by the Raven Queen"
21-01-2021T23:05:04,ChromaticBard,lol
21-01-2021T23:05:30,Roughlandin,Basically everything I know about D&D comes from Critical Role lol
21-01-2021T23:05:40,ChromaticBard,That was me for a while lol
21-01-2021T23:05:52,SageSaga,"he saw a great mass of tentacles in his dreams that drove him partially mad- and he figured- ""A new god is born! I must tell the people of the God of the Dark Star!"""
21-01-2021T23:05:55,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s like a different language in English
21-01-2021T23:05:57,ChromaticBard,"I'm even running a Wildemount campaign, but have been trying to move away from the crit role stuff"
21-01-2021T23:06:15,Roughlandin,"We're speaking nerd, kiwi"
21-01-2021T23:06:28,SageSaga,and he started a church and started getting followers
21-01-2021T23:06:48,ChromaticBard,Nice
21-01-2021T23:07:21,Roughlandin,"People like things with tentacles, right?"
21-01-2021T23:07:33,SageSaga,"one of my party members was like ""you arent really a cleric- are you?"" and i then cast Sacred flame and he was like ""Oh- well i guess i was wrong about you!"""
21-01-2021T23:07:49,ChromaticBard,lol
21-01-2021T23:07:56,ChromaticBard,Pact of the Tome?
21-01-2021T23:08:04,SageSaga,of course
21-01-2021T23:08:07,ChromaticBard,Nice
21-01-2021T23:08:33,SageSaga,i also had the healer feat and i would pretend i was casting healing magic as i bandaged people up
21-01-2021T23:08:42,ChromaticBard,That's amazing
21-01-2021T23:09:05,SageSaga,i think ive told yall about him before- we found some gauntlets of Orge Power and none of the other people in the party wanted or needed them
21-01-2021T23:09:13,ChromaticBard,Wow
21-01-2021T23:09:16,SageSaga,"so i - the Halfling ""Cleric"" took them"
21-01-2021T23:09:25,Roughlandin,Half size. Full power.
21-01-2021T23:09:40,SageSaga,and a cultist picked me out as one of the weaker people and tried to sneak up on me and stab me
21-01-2021T23:09:43,ChromaticBard,I am way too nice of a DM. My players have a ton of (Mostly common) magic items
21-01-2021T23:10:00,SageSaga,"so i grappled him- and he screamed ""OH GODS! HIS TINY HANDS ARE SO STRONG!"""
21-01-2021T23:10:21,ChromaticBard,"Oh, I have a fun moment that happened during session tonight"
21-01-2021T23:10:24,Roughlandin,So strong but... soft?
21-01-2021T23:10:28,Werewing,"Well, that sounds lewd."
21-01-2021T23:10:32,Roughlandin,lol
21-01-2021T23:10:35,ChromaticBard,"Party starts some rp. The alchemist talking the rogue that doesn't talk much: ""So, why don't you talk?"" The rogue: ""It's a waste of air."" The alchemist: ""There's so many trees around this place!"" The other rogue who does talk a bit: ""You're a waste of air"

21-01-2021T23:11:30,SageSaga,i pinned him to the ground - used thaumaturgy to turn my eyes black - and used Telepathy to deceive him into thinking i was an agent of his boss leading these adventurers to be sacrificed
21-01-2021T23:11:38,ChromaticBard,Nice
21-01-2021T23:12:12,Roughlandin,Everybody loves a nice sacrifice!
21-01-2021T23:12:17,Roughlandin,So festive!
21-01-2021T23:12:51,SageSaga,"as we killed the demon they worshiped he was yelling ""Why?!"" and i turned my eyes black and said ""This is the will of the black star."" and converted him to a follower"
21-01-2021T23:13:03,ChromaticBard,All I can think of when I hear someone mentioning using thaumaturgy to change their eye color is rave eye Caduceus
