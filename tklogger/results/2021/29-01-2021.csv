29-01-2021T00:54:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I have found a youtube channel
29-01-2021T00:54:39,SpazztasticKiwi,that does honest versions of commercials
29-01-2021T00:55:09,KeefMcDerpface,Sounds intresting.
29-01-2021T00:59:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Jesus the honest birth control ad
29-01-2021T00:59:45,SpazztasticKiwi,*wheeze*
29-01-2021T01:01:24,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
29-01-2021T01:01:29,KeefMcDerpface,night ord
29-01-2021T01:01:38,Ordithus,night!
29-01-2021T01:03:20,SpazztasticKiwi,day!
29-01-2021T01:06:38,CrRAR,:rooster:
29-01-2021T01:07:58,KeefMcDerpface,\o Night all. :ptv-sleepy:
29-01-2021T01:10:58,SpazztasticKiwi,this guy showed off his hidden trap door to the basement
29-01-2021T01:11:19,SpazztasticKiwi,the way to trigger it is stepping on the edge of this one certain plank
29-01-2021T01:11:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"imagine going to your bros house and step on a loose plank, all of a sudden you‚Äôre under the downstairs"
29-01-2021T01:13:10,SpazztasticKiwi,oh and I‚Äôm looking for a airpod case
29-01-2021T01:13:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I had one saved on amazon but it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot available‚Äù anymore
29-01-2021T01:14:36,CrRAR,laaame
29-01-2021T01:15:00,CrRAR,I question the legitimate need for a trapdoor
29-01-2021T01:15:24,CrRAR,hidden reading room/study or something is one thing
29-01-2021T01:15:57,CrRAR,I guess if the trapdoor is filled with alligators for your enemies it's okay
29-01-2021T01:16:03,CrRAR,or snakes
29-01-2021T01:17:10,CrRAR,I guess it would be a neat party trick given a fog machine is involved
29-01-2021T01:17:40,SpazztasticKiwi,oh it looks like it‚Äôs got a pull rope too
29-01-2021T01:17:58,SpazztasticKiwi,so falling to your death is apparently less likely
29-01-2021T01:18:09,SpazztasticKiwi,that‚Äôs good news
29-01-2021T01:18:18,CrRAR,no LEVER!?
29-01-2021T01:18:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I still question the why
29-01-2021T01:18:43,SpazztasticKiwi,why not just have a downstairs den
29-01-2021T01:18:54,CrRAR,does it just go to a crawlspace?
29-01-2021T01:19:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"it‚Äôs a part of the floor that lifts up, you go downstairs, and there‚Äôs a man cave sort of room"
29-01-2021T01:20:01,SpazztasticKiwi,is that a crawl space
29-01-2021T01:20:15,CrRAR,nopppeeer
29-01-2021T01:20:54,SpazztasticKiwi,dude made a batcave that requires manpower to get to
29-01-2021T01:21:25,CrRAR,"if I fell into a big comfy recliner after that ordeal, adorned with popcorn, wouldn't even be mad"
29-01-2021T01:22:06,CrRAR,"""whatdafaaaaa- *plompfh* alright then"""
29-01-2021T01:22:16,CrRAR,:popcorn:
29-01-2021T01:23:12,CrRAR,"does ""manpower"" indicate a slide or fire pole?"
29-01-2021T01:23:36,SpazztasticKiwi,oooooo I watched pocahontas last night
29-01-2021T01:23:55,SpazztasticKiwi,manpower as in he‚Äôs got to open the hatch to get in
29-01-2021T01:24:09,CrRAR,I watched about 30 mins about 30 mins ago haha
29-01-2021T01:24:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I have pocahontas 2 ready tonight
29-01-2021T01:24:57,CrRAR,I completely forgot about the villian guy's pug
29-01-2021T01:25:10,CrRAR,he's so diabolical
29-01-2021T01:25:42,SpazztasticKiwi,the reality is weird
29-01-2021T01:25:51,CrRAR,yeah it really is
29-01-2021T01:25:51,SpazztasticKiwi,pocahontas was actually 14
29-01-2021T01:26:03,SpazztasticKiwi,she really hated john smith
29-01-2021T01:26:20,SpazztasticKiwi,ratcliff was a good guy for the most part
29-01-2021T01:26:46,CrRAR,"yeah it's all really fictitious, I for some reason remember the beginning of the movie differently"
29-01-2021T01:26:49,SpazztasticKiwi,pocahontas wanted to marry kocoum or however you spell his name
29-01-2021T01:26:58,CrRAR,ah ok
29-01-2021T01:27:17,CrRAR,yeah the historical accuracy is awful lol
29-01-2021T01:27:21,SpazztasticKiwi,at least this is according to historians
29-01-2021T01:27:56,SpazztasticKiwi,she could‚Äôve been ok with marrying kocoum because he was intended for her and it was a tradition thing
29-01-2021T01:28:03,SpazztasticKiwi,or she could‚Äôve loved him
29-01-2021T01:28:46,CrRAR,"yeah, I mean tribal society was probably pretty strongly reinforced by their beliefs and such"
29-01-2021T01:29:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I would‚Äôve picked him over john probably in both instances
29-01-2021T01:29:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"raised in the same tribe, there were no slackers"
29-01-2021T01:29:50,SpazztasticKiwi,men hunted and provided and built
29-01-2021T01:30:14,SpazztasticKiwi,and they had the physiques to go with that
29-01-2021T01:31:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I take a man that will make and provide for himself over one that takes from other locations and calls them his
29-01-2021T01:31:40,CrRAR,yeap
29-01-2021T01:32:10,CrRAR,"resourceful, authenticity"
29-01-2021T01:32:16,SpazztasticKiwi,it‚Äôs not until you watch some of these older movies that you see how bad they are
29-01-2021T01:32:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"not in quality, but in honesty"
29-01-2021T01:32:41,CrRAR,colonialism is a disease
29-01-2021T01:32:49,SpazztasticKiwi,the colonists were leaches
29-01-2021T01:33:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"and worse, they didn‚Äôt just take everything good and then abandon the locations in ruin"
29-01-2021T01:33:35,CrRAR,yeah it just corrupts otherwise wholesome self-sufficient societies
29-01-2021T01:33:36,SpazztasticKiwi,they left behind germs and I‚Äôm sure pollution
29-01-2021T01:34:06,CrRAR,suddenly the conventions that made the society prosperous fall apart
29-01-2021T01:34:17,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúthese white men are dangerous‚Äù: that‚Äôs it ladies and gentlemen - history in one sentence
29-01-2021T01:34:28,CrRAR,"cuz of the ""grass is greener"" phenomenon"
29-01-2021T01:34:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"the majority, anyway"
29-01-2021T01:35:09,SpazztasticKiwi,can you imagine if they had lived with the Native Americans
29-01-2021T01:35:16,CrRAR,some old world societies were bound to fall apart on their own
29-01-2021T01:35:58,SpazztasticKiwi,either closeby or integrated
29-01-2021T01:36:11,CrRAR,"just think of 'dead' religions that exist, lots of cultures used religion to explain 'place' and function in society."
29-01-2021T01:36:30,CrRAR,and explain large concepts with myths and such
29-01-2021T01:37:09,SpazztasticKiwi,they would‚Äôve for one learned to be self sufficient rather than waste some resources like parts of animals that can be recycled into utensils
29-01-2021T01:37:25,SpazztasticKiwi,or building materials
29-01-2021T01:37:48,CrRAR,"what typically would go wrong is some leader wouldn't lead by example, or somehow real factors would break the illusion that the world follows the rules of their beliefs"
29-01-2021T01:38:13,CrRAR,and everyone would get skeptical and the society would fall apart
29-01-2021T01:38:31,SpazztasticKiwi,them nasty free thinkers
29-01-2021T01:39:18,CrRAR,"if you look up ""cargo cults"" you'll kind of see how even brief influence can affect small island nations"
29-01-2021T01:39:29,SpazztasticKiwi,like the woman who proposed that women think for themselves and be an equal in a marriage
29-01-2021T01:39:30,CrRAR,and societies
29-01-2021T01:39:43,CrRAR,mmmhmm
29-01-2021T01:39:46,SpazztasticKiwi,she  started a movement that ruffled all sorts of feathers
29-01-2021T01:40:17,CrRAR,"""oh no, that sounds different, what is this nonsense!"""
29-01-2021T01:40:37,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúwe want to make adult  decisions for ourselves as adults‚Äù

29-01-2021T16:09:49,SageSaga,might have some issues

29-01-2021T16:12:42,SageSaga,little do they know like 80% of people hit my truck kun are people who hate their life or are stuck in a horrible school/work situation XD

29-01-2021T16:14:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I want a Isekai where the protag becomes a truck tbh
29-01-2021T16:14:45,SageSaga,btw - ive seen Isekai stories that try to avoid Truck-kun in several ways- one the person is about to get hit- and they get pushed out of the way- only to be thrown into a summoning portal-
29-01-2021T16:15:19,SageSaga,and then there's one where a girl is going to be hit when her mother saves her- and after the funeral she gets summoned-
29-01-2021T16:16:14,SageSaga,i cant remember where but im pretty sure i saw one where the person driving the truck was the one who died and went to another world-
29-01-2021T16:16:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Both of those sound like things that would happen in Gintama

29-01-2021T18:01:53,SageSaga,hope someone takes his gun away- not because im anti gun but- you dont want a person going through serious misery like that to have a gun

29-01-2021T18:03:51,SageSaga,"it does piss me off when you spout a gun fact like how many deaths are caused by guns a year and a gun nut says ""That number is wrong because it includes suicide by guns!"" and im just like - uhh YEAH"
29-01-2021T18:04:33,SpazztasticKiwi,another factor is they‚Äôre saying this is from a guy that keeps a loaded gun next to his bed
29-01-2021T18:04:48,SpazztasticKiwi,with a small child in the house
29-01-2021T18:05:12,CrRAR,"yeah, it's like ""Imma completely miss the point for the sake of LESS safety"""
29-01-2021T18:06:22,Ordithus,clearly he should not have a gun. there is no justice to be had... horrifyingly tragic bad decision

29-01-2021T18:12:42,Ordithus,lol
29-01-2021T18:12:45,SageSaga,i had asked my brother in law if he knew of a place to get Lute and old instruments for composition software

29-01-2021T19:10:28,Ordithus,"no wait, there it goes. after it let the freezer thaw..."
29-01-2021T19:18:41,SpazztasticKiwi,you know how to tell when somebody‚Äôs lying

29-01-2021T19:39:57,SpazztasticKiwi,they won‚Äôt look at you
29-01-2021T19:40:13,SpazztasticKiwi,especially when saying the lie
29-01-2021T19:40:43,SpazztasticKiwi,~somebody~ just got caught in a lie today
29-01-2021T19:41:57,CrRAR,uhoh
29-01-2021T19:45:30,CrRAR,was the somebody that work somebody?
29-01-2021T20:38:42,SpazztasticKiwi,yep
29-01-2021T20:38:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll explain when I get to break
29-01-2021T20:40:24,CrRAR,np
29-01-2021T21:10:56,CrRAR,*watching Moana if I‚Äôm unresponsive*
29-01-2021T21:15:53,SpazztasticKiwi,alrighty
29-01-2021T21:16:13,SpazztasticKiwi,so well start with the fact everyone has to learn how to write on cakes
29-01-2021T21:16:36,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúhappy birthday‚Äù + whatever name they give you
29-01-2021T21:16:47,SpazztasticKiwi,rarely have I had them ask me to write anything else
29-01-2021T21:17:21,SpazztasticKiwi,the manager and store manager has said this is a requirement for everyone
29-01-2021T21:18:18,SpazztasticKiwi,well a customer comes up and asks for a cake they picked out to be written on and girly tells them she ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù & the cake decorator isn‚Äôt here so we can‚Äôt
29-01-2021T21:18:56,SpazztasticKiwi,well I cut in and told her I can write in it & I can show her when I do but we‚Äôre all required to do so
29-01-2021T21:19:35,SpazztasticKiwi,first ‚Äúher‚Äù = customer/ second ‚Äúher‚Äù = coworker
29-01-2021T21:20:28,SpazztasticKiwi,well coworker gets defensive & irritated (I‚Äôve embarrassed her and called her out on doing something wrong) and ultimately spouts our that the manager told her she didn‚Äôt have to write on cakes
29-01-2021T21:20:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"and again I tell her it‚Äôs a requirement, more or less disproving the idea she was told she didn‚Äôt have to write on cakes"
29-01-2021T21:22:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"so she‚Äôs salty but I still go on about showing and telling the whole process that you get an icing bag, get a decorating tip & fastener, put it together, and so on - telling her you can write in print or cursive & it‚Äôll take practice but you‚Äôll get the"
29-01-2021T21:23:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"hang of it but also don‚Äôt worry because none of us are really good at it, and you can put your elbow on the counter to steady your hand"
29-01-2021T21:24:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"this entire explanation, she‚Äôs walked off, is making a point of ignoring me by busying herself with the temperature check device and even goes so far as to start serving a customer and talking over me"
29-01-2021T21:25:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"on my break, I let management know & ran by the cake decorator before I left that I might talk to the store manager about going home (one because my stomachs been off for a few days and I‚Äôm not about to deal with that nonsense today & I know they‚Äôll ask"
29-01-2021T21:26:03,SpazztasticKiwi,why I need to leave early)
29-01-2021T21:27:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"since I got back from break, I‚Äôm not sure if her tantrum passed or she overheard anything but she‚Äôs been as nice and cooperative as can be since"
29-01-2021T21:29:42,AspiringNoodle,*shakes head in disappointment*
29-01-2021T21:41:38,Ordithus,watch as she is a prodigee at cake writing
29-01-2021T21:54:27,CrRAR,"ah, yeah that‚Äôs a pretty simple thing to ask that cake counter duties include that."
29-01-2021T21:54:41,CrRAR,common sense type thing
29-01-2021T21:56:07,CrRAR,back to movie
29-01-2021T21:56:14,CrRAR,:sunny::ocean::sailboat::notes:
29-01-2021T22:04:10,SpazztasticKiwi,she‚Äôs been caught claiming not knowing  how to do something when someone or multiple someones have shown her
29-01-2021T22:04:35,SpazztasticKiwi,then she changes her story and tone as if ‚Äúwell I just forgot‚Äù or ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt sure‚Äù
29-01-2021T22:05:41,SpazztasticKiwi,or says you have an attitude or are being patronizing
29-01-2021T22:06:40,SpazztasticKiwi,how are you gonna ask me a question and then give me an attitude because I answered & it wasn‚Äôt the answer you liked or wanted
29-01-2021T22:07:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"or better yet, why ask and then be mad when I explain it more simply because you didn‚Äôt understand what I meant the first time"
29-01-2021T22:21:22,SpazztasticKiwi,in any case management knows so its their headache now
29-01-2021T22:23:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm getting a pizza
29-01-2021T22:27:47,AspiringNoodle,She sounds like the kinda brat that needs a super shitty job real soon so she can shape up.
29-01-2021T22:42:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I like her fine but the picking and choosing what she wants to do or has as her responsibilities because she doesn‚Äôt want to learn or doesn‚Äôt know how to do
29-01-2021T22:43:01,SpazztasticKiwi,not gonna fly
29-01-2021T22:46:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"& whoever you are, you‚Äôre sure as shit not gonna lie to me"
29-01-2021T23:05:15,CrRAR,"yeap, it's like advanced lazy too cuz she was just completely dismissive."
29-01-2021T23:05:51,CrRAR,"not no way, not no how (unless there's a decorator)"
29-01-2021T23:06:56,CrRAR,"I could see her trying to cover herself being like ""we don't do cakes, RIGHT?"" *nudge nudge*"
29-01-2021T23:07:06,CrRAR,but that's not right
29-01-2021T23:12:39,SpazztasticKiwi,she‚Äôs worked long enough to know her responsibilities and know how to do everything
29-01-2021T23:13:46,SpazztasticKiwi,and yet she still needs to be reminded of this or that or doesn‚Äôt do some things with the excuse she doesn‚Äôt know how or doesn‚Äôt know the answer
29-01-2021T23:15:18,CrRAR,yup
29-01-2021T23:16:01,SpazztasticKiwi,but it‚Äôs amazing how polite and cooperative we get when I go over her head to management
29-01-2021T23:16:38,SpazztasticKiwi,suddenly we‚Äôre on our best behavior and got our listening ears on
29-01-2021T23:17:45,CrRAR,:sparkles::rainbow::sparkles:
29-01-2021T23:17:52,CrRAR,like magic
29-01-2021T23:18:59,CrRAR,*suddenly she‚Äôs breaking out in disney numbers decorating cakes*
29-01-2021T23:19:05,SpazztasticKiwi,she must‚Äôve heard me say if she gives me attitude or a look again tonight I‚Äôm going straight to (store manager‚Äôs name)
29-01-2021T23:19:18,SpazztasticKiwi,or she got over her mad spell
29-01-2021T23:21:21,SpazztasticKiwi,personally I don‚Äôt care but the thing is I know I‚Äôm not a manager or boss but I ask whether you‚Äôd want me to redirect you or tell you how things go
29-01-2021T23:22:05,SpazztasticKiwi,or do you want to be wrote up or terminated lest an actual boss come by and catch you
29-01-2021T23:23:35,SpazztasticKiwi,there‚Äôs times I wonder if being somewhere in the boss line up would be better because of those ones that don‚Äôt hear a word I say
29-01-2021T23:24:24,SpazztasticKiwi,but I‚Äôm not interested & there‚Äôd be ~plenty~of people that would really really no longer like me
29-01-2021T23:24:51,CrRAR,yeah work politics can be weird sometimes
29-01-2021T23:25:33,CrRAR,gotta use discretion
29-01-2021T23:28:14,CrRAR,got pizza yet?
29-01-2021T23:28:55,CrRAR,moana over here
29-01-2021T23:29:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve been stuffing my face for the past 20 minutes
