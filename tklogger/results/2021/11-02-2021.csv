11-02-2021T00:09:19,CrRAR,you think it‚Äôs like a prank just to get your reaction?
11-02-2021T00:09:52,CrRAR,wicked clever if so
11-02-2021T00:14:43,CrRAR,perhaps just a way he reminds himself how much he‚Äôs loved~

11-02-2021T17:21:06,CrimsonQuill086,Hi guys
11-02-2021T17:21:11,CrimsonQuill086,Just seen new Page
11-02-2021T17:21:29,CrimsonQuill086,There is definitely more to Nibs than meets the eye-squirrels don't growl!
11-02-2021T17:21:39,CrimsonQuill086,:ctwokinds-nibrun::ctwokinds-power:
11-02-2021T17:29:20,SpazztasticKiwi,oh yes they do
11-02-2021T17:29:34,CrimsonQuill086,I sit corrected.
11-02-2021T17:29:42,SpazztasticKiwi,they have a defensive growl noise
11-02-2021T17:31:07,Twokinds,very squeaky
11-02-2021T17:31:36,CrimsonQuill086,"Still, I really love how this chapter is shaping up."
11-02-2021T17:31:56,CrimsonQuill086,The tension's very high-I could play an etude off of it!
11-02-2021T17:32:18,CrimsonQuill086,(I actually have an old etude for cello somewhere...)
11-02-2021T17:34:10,Mediawatcher,I think it was the way nibbly growled that was odd
11-02-2021T17:34:20,Mediawatcher,Remus has never heard a squirrel growl like that
11-02-2021T17:40:50,CrimsonQuill086,Agreed

11-02-2021T17:42:53,SpazztasticKiwi,have any of you seen an angry chipmunk
11-02-2021T17:43:24,CrRAR,they usually seem like they avoid angry confrontation
11-02-2021T17:43:37,CrRAR,off too happier places!
11-02-2021T17:43:39,SpazztasticKiwi,squirrels getting fiesty is eventful but a grumpled chipmunk is entertaining
11-02-2021T17:43:52,SpazztasticKiwi,unless they go after you
11-02-2021T17:44:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"like bunnies, chipmunks stomp at you"
11-02-2021T17:44:34,CrRAR,like stomp their hind legs or something?
11-02-2021T17:44:48,SpazztasticKiwi,hind or front
11-02-2021T17:45:04,SpazztasticKiwi,& skunks stomp before spraying
11-02-2021T17:45:57,SpazztasticKiwi,but even better: a chipmunk will be all fluffed up
11-02-2021T17:46:53,SpazztasticKiwi,so you have an angry pouf of fur maybe the size of a soda can trying to intimidate you into leaving
11-02-2021T17:48:39,CrRAR,an unstoppable floof meets an immovable object

11-02-2021T18:38:31,ZapiliDver,Hi all!
11-02-2021T19:04:53,Twokinds,Working on the finishing touches of book 5.
11-02-2021T19:05:03,Twokinds,Also book 6.
11-02-2021T19:06:33,Twokinds,"I can't believe it, but book 6 goes all the way to Edinmire, with Reni Adira and Maeve. It ends at ch19's start, and then Book 7 is current events."
11-02-2021T19:06:51,Twokinds,So the books will finally be caught up with the online comic.

11-02-2021T21:19:30,BadFoMo,"Also, if I do get banned again, can it be for a shorter time? The rest of the stream felt like a bit too much."
11-02-2021T21:19:55,SageSaga,thats a pretty normal ban time
11-02-2021T21:20:03,Ordithus,just don't get banned :P
11-02-2021T21:20:12,Davoerlo,^
11-02-2021T21:20:21,Davoerlo,That seems like the easier option
11-02-2021T21:20:21,Twokinds,"Bad, you were only banned for like, 30 min."
11-02-2021T21:20:26,qwe304,when i got shadowbanned by sage it was for a bit longert than that lol
11-02-2021T21:20:34,qwe304,tbh he probably forgoot about me

11-02-2021T21:21:23,SageSaga,i usually write temp bans down and do them after the stream
11-02-2021T21:21:25,qwe304,nice sketch tho
11-02-2021T21:21:56,qwe304,@SageSaga this was probably two years ago at this point
11-02-2021T21:22:19,Nekonny,I'll be working on the base colors for a bikini art set
11-02-2021T21:22:25,Nekonny,so characters are not naked

11-02-2021T22:53:24,Tharkis,yeah i was thinking red hair might match a grey tabby  or a calico
11-02-2021T22:53:41,Tharkis,or even a tortishell (though that's  just a calico without any white)
11-02-2021T22:54:33,SageSaga,perhaps you should not be a coward and make her all red!

11-02-2021T23:00:14,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RaineEep:
11-02-2021T23:00:18,Ustudios,the problem with white hair and red skin furr is that red is an incredible powerful color
11-02-2021T23:00:33,Ustudios,its one of the most powerful eye grabbing colors after pure white or pure black
11-02-2021T23:00:42,Ustudios,also if you use brown you have the same issue because brown has red in it
11-02-2021T23:00:52,AkelaStormclaw,"Hey @twokinds, could she glow a little bit?"
11-02-2021T23:01:03,HaniaEnapay,The transparency is a great touch
11-02-2021T23:01:08,Ustudios,if you want to use brown on this pic I would suggest patches of brown fur might work like a calico maybe even grey fur
11-02-2021T23:01:12,Nekonny,I'll use this color as the shade
11-02-2021T23:02:13,Chalodraws,Red is fun

11-02-2021T23:04:27,Tharkis,if you're showing armpit you need to not have it connect
11-02-2021T23:05:00,Nekonny,it dfeels off though
11-02-2021T23:05:56,Tharkis,"that""line"" should more properly connect with the crease between the deltoid and bicept"
