07-03-2021T16:38:42,SonOfGoku,Hi Quill
07-03-2021T16:39:00,CrimsonQuill086,Hi there
07-03-2021T16:44:49,CrRAR,"dunno, just lots of cute stuff"
07-03-2021T16:45:06,CrimsonQuill086,"Ah, alas"
07-03-2021T16:45:12,CrRAR,tom adjourned after sketch 3 tho
07-03-2021T16:45:47,CrimsonQuill086,Understandable. Man's been working his backside off over the past year or so
07-03-2021T16:46:53,CrRAR,"wait, 4 sketches"
07-03-2021T16:47:06,CrRAR,the last was Trace/Flora genderswap
07-03-2021T16:47:29,CrRAR,spooked tiger boi
07-03-2021T16:47:44,CrimsonQuill086,XD That sounds fun!
07-03-2021T16:48:15,CrimsonQuill086,I had a bit of a surprise when I found out how old that AU was...along with Male Kathrin (Which was adorable)
07-03-2021T16:48:27,CrimsonQuill086,Back during my saving binge
07-03-2021T16:51:05,CrRAR,"oh yeah, like early 2010s"
07-03-2021T16:51:30,CrimsonQuill086,"My best friend first told me about the comic in 2016, shortly after I discovered Mark"
07-03-2021T16:51:46,CrRAR,I think during a lot of the post-kickstart era streams
07-03-2021T16:52:18,CrimsonQuill086,I looked at one page...where Kathrin's saved by Natani from the ship. I thought it was a mine. Didn't really manage to read it till 2017 (same year I discovered Halo and Warhammer 40k)
07-03-2021T16:52:25,CrimsonQuill086,"Christmas, actually"
07-03-2021T16:52:43,CrimsonQuill086,...it might be one of the biggest things in my life for the past few years
07-03-2021T16:54:54,CrRAR,"somehow, as soon as I built a computer I found my way here shortly after."
07-03-2021T16:55:05,CrRAR,call of the :ctwokinds-awoo:
07-03-2021T16:55:16,CrimsonQuill086,:) It is a lovely comic
07-03-2021T16:55:32,CrimsonQuill086,Though I must admit the first few chapters haven't aged well.
07-03-2021T16:55:46,CrRAR,"oddly, I joined around the giant Natani confusion era."
07-03-2021T16:56:09,CrRAR,like around the festival/RIBBONSSS time
07-03-2021T16:56:19,CrimsonQuill086,"I love Twokinds to bits, but it's clear that Tom was still trying to figure out what he was actually  writing up to about the Basitin Arc"
07-03-2021T16:56:31,CrimsonQuill086,"Seriously, every time I read that Arc, it strikes such a RESONANCE."
07-03-2021T16:56:47,CrimsonQuill086,"Especially Keith and Alaric's duel on the bridge, and the Trial with the generals."
07-03-2021T16:57:16,CrimsonQuill086,"""How dare you Blaspheme the law?!"" ""The law is not a religious doctrine!"" Two of the best lines in the seriesd"
07-03-2021T16:57:31,CrRAR,"yeah, a first great trial for our heroes"
07-03-2021T16:57:37,CrimsonQuill086,Highlights quite a few problems we have here as well.
07-03-2021T16:57:43,CrRAR,must refute
07-03-2021T16:58:01,CrimsonQuill086,"Chapters 16-17 really hit as well, because of the Confessions, and especially Raine and Red's dynamic"
07-03-2021T16:58:08,CrimsonQuill086,Plus Sythe and Nibs
07-03-2021T16:58:27,CrimsonQuill086,"Red honestly doesn't get enough love in the sketches, in my opinion"
07-03-2021T16:58:32,CrRAR,doesn't help the templars were sort of skewing Basitin ways a bit further
07-03-2021T16:58:42,CrimsonQuill086,"Oh, heck yes."
07-03-2021T16:58:56,CrRAR,to zealotry
07-03-2021T16:59:01,CrRAR,sorta
07-03-2021T16:59:06,CrimsonQuill086,"It is terrifying, however, how even that deep into madness, Trace was such a good planner."
07-03-2021T16:59:20,CrRAR,yeah
07-03-2021T16:59:32,CrimsonQuill086,"Ironic that his own handpicked acolytes have all ended up betraying him, one way or another."
07-03-2021T16:59:59,CrimsonQuill086,"Even the dark shade of himself, Detritus, rejects their old master, considering themself more worthy of the name..."
07-03-2021T17:01:14,CrRAR,"dark magic, a slippery slope"
07-03-2021T17:01:43,CrRAR,"""oh crap, everyone left in my wake exposed to my ways have gone insane"""
07-03-2021T17:01:53,CrRAR,"""seems bad, fam"""
07-03-2021T17:02:26,CrRAR,I think Tom mentioned before the plan was to have everyone travel to the Basitin Isle yet everything would have already deteriorated because of the magic use
07-03-2021T17:02:57,CrRAR,so it could have just been a lots of demented screaming and erratic magic blasting
07-03-2021T17:03:42,CrimsonQuill086,I'm personally glad he went for the angle he did. It allowed for a great deal more character analysis.
07-03-2021T17:04:15,CrRAR,"yup, haphazardly saved the day by being morally righteous meddlers"
07-03-2021T17:04:21,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-kingtea:
07-03-2021T17:05:00,CrimsonQuill086,"D'you know, the Basitins actually remind me of Ireland during the 20th century, although not to the same degree-especially from the 20s to the 60s."
07-03-2021T17:05:00,CrRAR,"templars: ""MAGIC!"""
07-03-2021T17:05:23,CrimsonQuill086,"Ireland back then had a similar cultural addiction to the 'Law', in this case being the Catholic Church."

07-03-2021T17:05:54,CrimsonQuill086,"Unfortunately, power corrupts, and this led to the horrific abuses that history has charted. I shall say no more of them here for now."
07-03-2021T17:06:27,CrRAR,"yeah, mostly just because societies want rules to live by to give their lives purpose and structure"
07-03-2021T17:06:44,CrimsonQuill086,"But the country certainly had similar cultural prejudices and obsession with following the 'doctrine'. Even today, Irish people as a whole don't look so kindly on those who break from the norm, although it is slowly changing."
07-03-2021T17:07:37,CrimsonQuill086,"There's a reason many Irish actors and Artists are more successful overseas (Enya, The Corrs, Saoirse Ronan, etc)"
07-03-2021T17:07:58,CrRAR,it's basically just vote for the national narrative you're most comfortable with
07-03-2021T17:08:18,CrimsonQuill086,Indeed. It probably applies to a host of countries.
07-03-2021T17:08:43,CrimsonQuill086,The core message is there though...blind adherence to laws or rules leads to stagnation and ruin
07-03-2021T17:09:09,CrimsonQuill086,That we NEED to think for ourselves and make choices based on our own consciences...for good or ill.
07-03-2021T17:09:24,CrRAR,"it's kinda like in Secret of the Kells, a solid societal philosophy is fundamental and superior in maintaining a unified nation"
07-03-2021T17:09:47,CrRAR,separate settlements can be divided or destroyed
07-03-2021T17:10:09,CrimsonQuill086,"Indeed! Cellach seeks safety in his walls, but fails to fortify the gate or the stairs, and when the northmen come...all burns."

07-03-2021T17:11:07,CrRAR,yeap
07-03-2021T17:11:43,CrimsonQuill086,"Although it's worth noting that Cellach was still trying to protect all...not just Christans, but pagans and other religions...no matter the banner, people are people."
07-03-2021T17:12:01,CrimsonQuill086,"Woah, this got real philisophical...I apologise."
07-03-2021T17:12:34,CrRAR,"yeah, just really a common ideology, mostly of mutual welfare"
07-03-2021T17:15:29,CrRAR,"conquering nations in history do have instances of bringing order and prosperity though, like the mongols"
07-03-2021T17:16:17,CrRAR,though I wouldn't be surprised if it was because of tribal structure where the mongols invaded
07-03-2021T17:16:33,CrRAR,non-unified people's already
07-03-2021T17:16:40,CrimsonQuill086,True that.
07-03-2021T17:16:58,CrimsonQuill086,Temujin was thorough in his integration of the nomad peoples...
07-03-2021T17:17:36,CrRAR,like it would have brought a single ideology for people to believe and live under
07-03-2021T17:17:46,CrRAR,same idea
07-03-2021T17:18:07,CrRAR,just brought with bloodshed
07-03-2021T17:20:06,CrimsonQuill086,I hope constantly that we'll become a less bloodthirsty species as a whole...
07-03-2021T17:20:14,CrimsonQuill086,"And less greedy, and prideful."
07-03-2021T17:22:08,CrimsonQuill086,A better people overall.
07-03-2021T17:22:22,CrimsonQuill086,"Then again, maybe I focus too much on the negatives..."
07-03-2021T17:24:37,CrRAR,"yeah that's the thing, unifying usually is in the interest of strength in numbers so if there's no enemy... then what?"
07-03-2021T17:24:58,CrimsonQuill086,"We become the enemy, that's what..."
