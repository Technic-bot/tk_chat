07-01-2021T00:26:47,AspiringNoodle,"But one day a patch rolled around and broke the mod, causing the weapon to actually do ZERO damage, players who used the mod were forced to use his abilities to secure kills, and some got banned because the automated systems detected unauthorized software"

07-01-2021T17:11:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"let me tell you, a 15 poundish cat CANNOT be subtle or sneaky but dammit do he try"
07-01-2021T17:19:01,CrRAR,they figure if they at least pretend they can't be seen someone might believe it.
07-01-2021T17:19:45,CrRAR,maybe humor him every so often and pretend you're surprised xD
07-01-2021T17:23:03,CrRAR,"tbh, cats in the wild will practice sneaking on their pals to teach them not to let their guard down from other predators"
07-01-2021T17:23:50,CrRAR,so it might just one of his ways of caring and keeping you safe :two_hearts:

07-01-2021T17:31:22,SpazztasticKiwi,& the slower he creeps the more gradual until he‚Äôs in place like he was there the whole time
07-01-2021T17:41:06,SpazztasticKiwi,lead levels 15 parts per billion and more is unacceptable
07-01-2021T17:41:42,CrRAR,"lead's bad, mmmkayy"
07-01-2021T17:41:54,SpazztasticKiwi,so tell me how ancient romans drank and ate substances contaminated at 2900 parts per billion & didn‚Äôt just immediately drop dead

07-01-2021T17:42:46,CrimsonQuill,So...yeah
07-01-2021T17:43:09,NinoGD,In chemestry I'm learning about that
07-01-2021T17:43:19,NinoGD,Water contaminants
07-01-2021T17:43:23,CrRAR,maybe they built up some sort of tolerance?
07-01-2021T17:43:33,CrRAR,is that even possible?
07-01-2021T17:43:37,CrimsonQuill,We have to filter all of our water
07-01-2021T17:43:46,ZapiliDver,Hi Quill
07-01-2021T17:43:58,CrimsonQuill,Hi Zapii
07-01-2021T17:44:01,CrimsonQuill,"Zapili, sorry"
07-01-2021T17:44:53,NinoGD,"I had to watch a video about the lead situation in Flint, Michigan"
07-01-2021T17:45:06,CrimsonQuill,Good Grief
07-01-2021T17:45:47,SpazztasticKiwi,tolerance? I can‚Äôt say that‚Äôs possible because there‚Äôs evidence and cases people doing that with other poisons & snake venom but lead..?
07-01-2021T17:45:57,CrRAR,wasn't there some sort of treatment cocktail that got neglected that led to that situation?
07-01-2021T17:45:59,ZapiliDver,"Still using lead pipes? Damn, i think that stuff ended near early 1920's in world"
07-01-2021T17:46:01,SpazztasticKiwi,[x]doubt
07-01-2021T17:46:16,CrimsonQuill,Not till the 70s in my country
07-01-2021T17:46:28,CrimsonQuill,Over 200'000 houses still have it
07-01-2021T17:46:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"as per the documentary, it‚Äôs believed that this poisoning is what made rome collapse"
07-01-2021T17:47:24,CrRAR,ah
07-01-2021T17:47:27,ZapiliDver,Time to switch to iron/copper/plastic
07-01-2021T17:48:09,CrRAR,looks like it lead to their downfall
07-01-2021T17:48:16,CrRAR,:ptv-dealwithit:
07-01-2021T17:48:20,SpazztasticKiwi,the elite were the only ones that could afford or who took part in the ancient sweetener whose cooking process laced it with deadly chemistry
07-01-2021T17:49:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"the romans weren‚Äôt aware lead was bad, let alone that cooking in lead pots helped the poison bond to food or made it worse"
07-01-2021T17:49:59,ZapiliDver,"hehe, Victorian epoch beauty standarts is more cruel & have more health non-friendly stuff"
07-01-2021T17:50:11,ZapiliDver,Arsenic at least
07-01-2021T17:50:49,SpazztasticKiwi,so it‚Äôs believed this is why the roman leaders had such a reputation for being odd erratic absent minded or unpredictable and dangerous
07-01-2021T17:51:36,SpazztasticKiwi,lead poisoning degrades the mind - and organs - but notably it messes with decision making and logic
07-01-2021T17:51:41,SpazztasticKiwi,common sense
07-01-2021T17:51:52,SpazztasticKiwi,moods
07-01-2021T17:52:36,ZapiliDver,"Also, about lead: leaded petrol also a ""good"" and more modern example."
07-01-2021T17:54:10,ZapiliDver,https://www.worstpolluted.org/projects_reports/display/66 <- leaded petrol & health problems. Nearly same as with lead water pipes
07-01-2021T17:55:17,SpazztasticKiwi,you can make the sweetener today
07-01-2021T17:55:45,SpazztasticKiwi,it was only toxic because they cooked in lead pots
07-01-2021T17:56:32,CrRAR,:skull_crossbones:
07-01-2021T17:57:59,SpazztasticKiwi,they also drank lead laced water from lead pipes so
07-01-2021T17:58:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"again, how did these people not just drop dead"
07-01-2021T17:58:41,SpazztasticKiwi,the average roman drank ~100 gallons of wine a year
07-01-2021T17:59:29,SpazztasticKiwi,which was sweetened with lead boiled grape syrup
07-01-2021T18:02:25,CrRAR,"cue the ""back in myyyy dayyyyy"" stories"
07-01-2021T18:06:46,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe they didn‚Äôt die because they were too drunk to notice they had enough metals in their blood to set off a metal detector
