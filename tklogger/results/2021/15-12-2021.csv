15-12-2021T22:50:34,CrRAR,just overall feels more slick
15-12-2021T22:50:56,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-Embersafe: rounded corners
15-12-2021T22:51:10,CrRAR,yee
15-12-2021T22:51:13,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-maevecute_xmas: 
15-12-2021T22:52:45,CrRAR,the one stupid habit I have that is that I often right-click to hit 'refresh' on desktop/folders to reorganize things occasionally and that is now hidden under the 2nd level :\
15-12-2021T22:53:10,CrRAR,I'm hoping they change that or I get used to it whichever comes first 
15-12-2021T22:55:34,CrRAR,I think back to some of the changes in Windows over the years though like from the Classic W98 Start Menu to XP and how horrible that was at first with the long jumplists going away
15-12-2021T22:55:53,CrRAR,I don't think the W11 changes feel as severe at least 
15-12-2021T22:55:59,Ordithus,photos feels snappier \o/
15-12-2021T22:56:29,CrRAR,oh yeah it is much more useful feeling too
15-12-2021T22:57:25,CrRAR,"W10's felt dumbed down compared to previous ones at first, never really grew on me"
15-12-2021T22:57:52,CrRAR,so many more buttons now

15-12-2021T23:03:00,CrRAR,"The maximize button now has like instant window layout snapping capabilities, I haven't really adapted to that seems useful in certain situations."
15-12-2021T23:03:34,Ordithus,:cw0lfmare-EmberO: okay now I want this on my work pc
15-12-2021T23:03:47,Ordithus,I use the snap function a ton
15-12-2021T23:04:20,CrRAR,yeah honestly for productivity it feels like a step back to the W7 practicality days
15-12-2021T23:04:41,CrRAR,yeah the whole snapping thing got completely beefed up
15-12-2021T23:08:13,CrRAR,there is actually an enhancement to that functionality in the PowerToys utility by Msft called FancyZones... 
15-12-2021T23:08:17,CrRAR,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/fancyzones
15-12-2021T23:08:55,CrRAR,"it sort of replicates like the Dell Display manager app functionality I think, but as a Windows utility"
15-12-2021T23:10:21,CrRAR,there are other bonus tools in PowerToys that are like easter egg-y type features that just didn't get baked into the OS for some reason or other.
15-12-2021T23:10:53,CrRAR,"I think that would work on W10 too possibly, not sure though"
15-12-2021T23:13:29,CrRAR,ah it has a color picker app too looks like that allows more freestyle color samples from random windows and places apparently.
15-12-2021T23:13:42,CrRAR,just weird oddball features like that
15-12-2021T23:18:01,Ordithus,of all things
15-12-2021T23:18:07,Ordithus,task manager is hanging and crashing
15-12-2021T23:18:21,CrRAR,oh dang

15-12-2021T23:26:46,Ordithus,I was just trying to see how much memory I was using
15-12-2021T23:26:51,Ordithus,seems to be working for now
15-12-2021T23:27:06,Ordithus,":cw0lfmare-PaperemberClose: I'm watching you, task manager"
15-12-2021T23:27:21,CrRAR,lol
15-12-2021T23:27:39,Ordithus,anyways! :ctwokinds-kingtea_xmas: rooibos
15-12-2021T23:28:59,CrRAR,"yeah RAM use I wish got slimmed down, at minimum I see maybe 4GB used, but that's like bare idle "
15-12-2021T23:29:22,CrRAR,W10 was a hog that way too though so ehh
15-12-2021T23:30:13,CrRAR,literally 5-6 is standard office type use typical load at all times these days
15-12-2021T23:30:39,CrRAR,"just download all the RAM, only solution"
