12-03-2021T00:00:07,CrRAR,I feel like that part of the story is just like the intro hook for the dive into what the rest of what that movie is
12-03-2021T00:00:37,CrRAR,which is pretty trippy lol
12-03-2021T00:00:50,SpazztasticKiwi,there was one time I was grabbed without warning and it was when I was a teen
12-03-2021T00:01:19,CrRAR,dang weirdos
12-03-2021T00:01:32,SpazztasticKiwi,guy in my grade thought it’d be Hilarious if he swung an arm around me and gave me an aggressive side hug mid conversation with friends
12-03-2021T00:01:39,SageSaga,i also dont want to spoil anything for anyone- but that time it happened he was in an extreme emotional state
12-03-2021T00:02:21,SpazztasticKiwi,i threw him off as fast as I could and sidled up closer to my group & wiggles into the less accessible middle - he and his friends laughed
12-03-2021T00:03:22,CrRAR,nothing like being randomly smothered
12-03-2021T00:03:33,SpazztasticKiwi,somebody hugs me and I don’t know who they are better identify themselves and take a big steppy back before I get postal
12-03-2021T00:03:43,Dadrobit,https://youtu.be/C3m0BNvxjgA 1:20-ish he consciously considers not doing it.
12-03-2021T00:03:47,SageSaga,im saying they are both teens in an impossible situation- you cant expect them to be completely rational people in a freaky friday situation
12-03-2021T00:04:38,SpazztasticKiwi,but is being a respectful guy with an understanding of how the girl whose body he swapped with would like to be treated during those freaky times too much to ask
12-03-2021T00:04:58,SageSaga,did you watch the movie?
12-03-2021T00:05:15,Dadrobit,"Aye, had he NOT done it, the movie woulda been way more redeemable"
12-03-2021T00:05:50,SageSaga,it was a perfect chance at a comedically timed event
12-03-2021T00:05:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m going off information that I’ve got from the conversation so far
12-03-2021T00:05:57,SpazztasticKiwi,“comedy”
12-03-2021T00:06:08,SageSaga,ok so you are missing a ton of context about an anime Kiwi
12-03-2021T00:06:47,CrRAR,it gets complex
12-03-2021T00:06:47,SpazztasticKiwi,that kind of comedy sounds rapey
12-03-2021T00:07:12,CrRAR,‘weathing with you’ stayed pretty simple
12-03-2021T00:07:14,TheSexyBeast,BRB
12-03-2021T00:07:16,SpazztasticKiwi,so provided these two swap bodies on occasion and find out maybe at one point to keep track of it and each other
12-03-2021T00:07:24,CrRAR,*’weathering with you’
12-03-2021T00:08:01,CrRAR,bit more formulaic though
12-03-2021T00:08:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"but they lose their memories sometimes when it happens so they don’t know it’s not their body? ok, they play around, but knowingly one plays around fully aware he’s in her body and she doesn’t like it"
12-03-2021T00:08:31,SpazztasticKiwi,how close
12-03-2021T00:09:22,SageSaga,they always lose most of their memories- they keep a bit but it always fades away
12-03-2021T00:09:56,Ordithus,"is this ""woah are these boobs"" groping or is it worse"
12-03-2021T00:10:10,SageSaga,just the boobs thing
12-03-2021T00:10:19,CrRAR,anime be like that sometimes
12-03-2021T00:10:22,CrRAR,it gets weird for the sake of weird
12-03-2021T00:10:45,Dadrobit,"I think you got it mixed up my dude. The notes are to keep track of what each of them is doing in each other's bodies, they remember what they're doing to each other and the notes that they get left. The big memory loss bit is only the one that happens"
12-03-2021T00:11:05,Dadrobit,"After the disaster, that's why they make a big deal out of it at that moment."
12-03-2021T00:11:21,SpazztasticKiwi,if he’s aware of being in her body & that it’s not his & she doesn’t like him playing with himself when he’s in her body & he still does it? unacceptable
12-03-2021T00:11:44,SpazztasticKiwi,more or less that’s my point
12-03-2021T00:11:57,SageSaga,they state that its like a dream and fades away- it just was happening so regularly - its why its such a big deal that he goes out to find her asap before it all leaves him
12-03-2021T00:12:06,CrRAR,that is perfectly reasonable
12-03-2021T00:12:57,SageSaga,i agree Kiwi- but im saying hes not fully aware of that- to him being in her body is like a dream- he often doesnt remember it or it doesnt feel real- theres a mental disconnect
12-03-2021T00:13:50,SageSaga,he tells her to stop spending all his money and messing with his love life - but she does it still anyways too- they are both doing this
12-03-2021T00:14:05,SageSaga,they are also both kids- they arent super rational beings
12-03-2021T00:15:52,CrRAR,yeah it’s meant to be like a goofy way two people connect through some weird... sci-fi circumstances
12-03-2021T00:16:16,Ordithus,at least we don't have to worry about this in real life
12-03-2021T00:16:21,CrRAR,lol
12-03-2021T00:16:26,Ordithus,stay in your own darn body
12-03-2021T00:16:38,Ordithus,it's crowded enough in here as is
12-03-2021T00:16:39,CrRAR,but... what if you
12-03-2021T00:16:44,CrRAR,COULDN’T
12-03-2021T00:16:50,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:
12-03-2021T00:16:53,Dadrobit,"The first, maybe second time? That's goofy. The fourth time where you know it's wrong? That's just sexual assault."
12-03-2021T00:16:54,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-smug:
12-03-2021T00:17:06,TheSexyBeast,"Back, but leaving again. I have a colossal headache and I'm going to lie down. See you all Sunday if not sooner."
12-03-2021T00:17:14,CrRAR,okay ;c
12-03-2021T00:17:18,Ordithus,"bye, hope you feel better"
12-03-2021T00:17:19,Dadrobit,Welcome back and goodbye! o/
12-03-2021T00:17:29,SpazztasticKiwi,an ice pack on the back of the head might take care of that
12-03-2021T00:17:30,CrRAR,:v: sexy
12-03-2021T00:17:47,SpazztasticKiwi,and I don’t mean hit yourself with it
12-03-2021T00:17:54,SpazztasticKiwi,lay it on the back of your head
12-03-2021T00:18:00,SageSaga,though that may too help
12-03-2021T00:18:07,CrRAR,haha
12-03-2021T00:18:14,SageSaga,distraction therapy
12-03-2021T00:18:37,Ordithus,"""now instead of a headache I have major head pain"""
12-03-2021T00:18:41,CrRAR,percussive maintenance
12-03-2021T00:18:46,CrRAR,to some
12-03-2021T00:19:07,SpazztasticKiwi,headache? give yourself a concussion
12-03-2021T00:19:17,CrRAR,:cw0lfmare-GoogleyEmber:
12-03-2021T00:19:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"trust me, I know first aid"
12-03-2021T00:19:39,CrRAR,just rub some aloe vera on it
12-03-2021T00:19:59,SpazztasticKiwi,nah breathe in some lavender essential oil
12-03-2021T00:20:07,SpazztasticKiwi,that fixes everything
12-03-2021T00:20:42,CrRAR,"warm compress on the face, ice pack on the back of head"
12-03-2021T00:20:50,CrRAR,confuse the shit out of it
12-03-2021T00:20:57,CrRAR,element of surprise
12-03-2021T00:21:22,SageSaga,unless you are allergic to lavender
12-03-2021T00:21:28,Ordithus,maybe distraction therapy was the real reason behind the drilling a hole in the skull to relieve headaches technique
12-03-2021T00:21:43,SageSaga,i personally hate lavender - but hate doesnt mean i have an allergy
12-03-2021T00:21:54,Dadrobit,"Oh, just watched that episode of Stargate SG-1!"
12-03-2021T00:22:17,CrRAR,lavender tea ain’t bad... I think
12-03-2021T00:22:44,Dadrobit,The head drilling bit I mean. To help cure a fever or something
12-03-2021T00:22:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll b bach...maybe
12-03-2021T00:22:52,CrRAR,ok
12-03-2021T00:22:57,Ordithus,see ya
12-03-2021T00:23:18,Dadrobit,o/
12-03-2021T00:24:39,SpazztasticKiwi,ok so Bagheera sneezed apparently is all
12-03-2021T00:24:47,CrRAR,pfff
12-03-2021T00:24:52,SpazztasticKiwi,it did not sound like any sneeze ive ever heard
12-03-2021T00:25:07,CrRAR,did it sound like a disaster?
12-03-2021T00:25:23,Dadrobit,Bless you kitty
12-03-2021T00:25:32,CrRAR,bless his heart
12-03-2021T00:28:32,CrRAR,"also spazz, your kitty not the only kitty getting into the plants:"

12-03-2021T00:28:45,CrRAR,must be the season or something
12-03-2021T00:30:25,SpazztasticKiwi,it sounded like someone stepping on a squeaky toy
12-03-2021T00:30:50,SpazztasticKiwi,naturally I was like ?tfwasthat?
12-03-2021T00:31:13,CrRAR,ooo freaky
12-03-2021T00:31:40,SageSaga,ive heard cat sneezes that sound like that
12-03-2021T00:33:11,CrRAR,lol
12-03-2021T00:33:23,CrRAR,wasn’t just a sneeze
12-03-2021T00:33:31,CrRAR,a sn-wheeze
12-03-2021T00:37:30,Dadrobit,":/ It's pouring and people are refusing to park far enough under my carport. So while I'm documenting and taking photos of the vehicle, I am getting completely soaked through...."
12-03-2021T00:38:26,Ordithus,I am spent. Good night! Thanks for strem

12-03-2021T00:38:42,Dadrobit,"Cya, Ord! o/"
12-03-2021T00:38:54,SpazztasticKiwi,sound like a movement I could get behind
12-03-2021T00:39:14,SpazztasticKiwi,maybe after this video
12-03-2021T00:40:10,CrRAR,rest beckons
12-03-2021T00:41:31,Dadrobit,Still got the better part of 7 hours of work left at least.
12-03-2021T00:42:05,SageSaga,i need a short break- i'll be back in about 10 minutes or so-
12-03-2021T00:42:13,CrRAR,alrighty sage
12-03-2021T00:42:30,Dadrobit,Kk
12-03-2021T00:44:29,CrRAR,"also, damn those evasive parkers dadro"
12-03-2021T00:44:39,CrRAR,do they have NO decency!?
12-03-2021T00:45:12,Dadrobit,Some of em? Zero.
12-03-2021T00:46:30,CrRAR,"it’d be even worse if they pull up like that and then look at you all apologetic like and go “oh no, you’re getting drenched”"
12-03-2021T00:46:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember working a drive thru
12-03-2021T00:46:40,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-katwet: “quite”
12-03-2021T00:46:44,Dadrobit,You'd be surprised how many don't even wear clothes.
12-03-2021T00:46:55,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
12-03-2021T00:47:08,SpazztasticKiwi,there’s folks that really don’t know the size of their car/the difference between a few inches and a foot
12-03-2021T00:47:09,Dadrobit,"However many you think of, it's not enough, I promise."
12-03-2021T00:47:38,CrRAR,my first thought: drivers? or fellow security personnel?
12-03-2021T00:47:44,Dadrobit,Drivers.
12-03-2021T00:48:12,Dadrobit,One of em is a regular. Boyfriend of one of the resident's daughter.
12-03-2021T00:48:19,CrRAR,I can see no shirt sometimes especially with the heat
12-03-2021T00:48:44,Dadrobit,Sometimes he'll wear like work out shorts.
12-03-2021T00:49:07,CrRAR,"I think tradesfolk, like landscapers or roofers when I think of no shirts people"
12-03-2021T00:49:14,Dadrobit,"Tons of folks are shirtless, ya."
12-03-2021T00:49:36,Dadrobit,Pants less is always a shocker.
12-03-2021T00:49:43,CrRAR,lol
12-03-2021T00:49:52,CrRAR,*begins walking up*
12-03-2021T00:50:01,SpazztasticKiwi,around here we don’t really get shirtless unless they’re coming in after or before swimming
12-03-2021T00:50:10,CrRAR,"“Oo-okay then, few steps back”"
12-03-2021T00:50:15,Dadrobit,"""Hey, how ya doing toni--- ohlordyourenaked"""
12-03-2021T00:50:21,CrRAR,lol
12-03-2021T00:51:01,SpazztasticKiwi,we get more guys that come in with a tank top with more holes than fabric or a shirt that’s had the sleeves ripped out & the underarms ripped down to the waist
12-03-2021T00:51:23,Dadrobit,"""fashion"""
12-03-2021T00:51:37,CrRAR,I feel like the difference between no-shirts and no nothing people would be no-shirts are more likely to have a bandana or tattered makeshift headband
12-03-2021T00:51:53,CrRAR,like rambo
12-03-2021T00:51:54,SpazztasticKiwi,with the only thing keeping it from qualifiying as a poncho that single thread at the very bottom hanging on by just a wish and a prayer
12-03-2021T00:52:17,CrRAR,so brave
12-03-2021T00:53:42,CrRAR,"It’d be hilarious if no-nothing people were just deadpan like, “What?”"
12-03-2021T00:53:49,CrRAR,“A/C don’t work”

12-03-2021T00:54:05,CrRAR,Like it’s a perfectly cogent explanation
12-03-2021T00:54:29,SpazztasticKiwi,“Im not checking you out I’m wondering how your manly bits are breathing”
12-03-2021T00:54:43,Dadrobit,"Nope, I don't acknowledge it and neither do they. Just gotta power through and be professional about it."
12-03-2021T00:54:58,CrRAR,yeah
12-03-2021T00:55:17,SpazztasticKiwi,no way some muscleheads can still feel anything below the waist
12-03-2021T00:55:17,Dadrobit,"Spazz, it has its own brain, but we only have one set of lungs"
12-03-2021T00:55:45,SpazztasticKiwi,at some point they squished everything to the size of tic tacs
12-03-2021T00:55:55,Dadrobit,Roids
12-03-2021T00:56:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean breathe as in elbow room from the body

12-03-2021T00:58:04,Dadrobit,Yuuuup
12-03-2021T00:58:59,SageSaga,took longer than i thought
12-03-2021T00:59:05,CrRAR,wb!
12-03-2021T00:59:13,SageSaga,ty
12-03-2021T01:00:47,SageSaga,Robit- did you see Penguin Highway?
12-03-2021T01:01:41,SpazztasticKiwi,little man might be the cutest name for it
12-03-2021T01:02:03,SpazztasticKiwi,“hi there little guy”
12-03-2021T01:02:29,Dadrobit,No? I did see March of the Penguins and Farce of the Penguins though.
12-03-2021T01:03:14,SageSaga,Penguin Highway was an anime movie that- well im not sure how to really explain it
12-03-2021T01:04:38,SageSaga,i think the trailer did a good job of making sense of it- though it doesnt make much sense either :P
12-03-2021T01:05:33,CrRAR,sounds interesting
12-03-2021T01:06:25,Dadrobit,Just watched the trailer.
12-03-2021T01:07:25,SageSaga,interesting or confusing?
12-03-2021T01:07:36,Dadrobit,"The top comment of ""Pokemon with penguins in coke cans,"" is pretty succinct."
12-03-2021T01:08:06,SageSaga,not accurate at all though
12-03-2021T01:08:26,Dadrobit,More confusing than interesting.
12-03-2021T01:08:32,CrRAR,sounds like an inspiring tale to encourage community cleanup
12-03-2021T01:08:58,CrRAR,maybe the can YOU find will have a penguin!
12-03-2021T01:09:06,Dadrobit,"RAR, that sounds like a plausible idea."
12-03-2021T01:09:14,CrRAR,"“no, no, NOPE, NOOOOO”"
12-03-2021T01:09:18,CrRAR,lol
12-03-2021T01:09:33,CrRAR,:penguin:
12-03-2021T01:09:42,CrRAR,there it is!
12-03-2021T01:10:18,SageSaga,its kinda like stranger things but no true horror elements
12-03-2021T01:10:26,CrRAR,huh
12-03-2021T01:10:34,Dadrobit,"Don't get me wrong, I like, obfuscating/confusing projects, but more in line with Death Stranding and Inception kinda stuff."
12-03-2021T01:10:34,SageSaga,theres some stuff thats a little scary in concept- but its not really an issue
12-03-2021T01:10:57,Dadrobit,Never got to watching Stranger Things.
12-03-2021T01:11:24,CrRAR,is it like that the real world stuff has another form metaphorically?
12-03-2021T01:11:25,Dadrobit,"(Which reminds me, I really really need to finish Death Stranding.)"
12-03-2021T01:11:44,CrRAR,"march, march, march on"
12-03-2021T01:12:32,Dadrobit,I might wait till I have a PS5 to play whatever remastered version comes out for that. Hoping I can get one soon ish.
12-03-2021T01:15:05,CrRAR,"death stranding is good, I guess in the sense that Silent Hill is a descent of a character, DS is a more hopeful path overall."
12-03-2021T01:16:14,Dadrobit,That game gameplay wise also had/has one of the best hardships to player reward systems I've seen in a game in some time.
12-03-2021T01:16:31,CrRAR,"the fact ‘chirality’ is a game concept is kinda meta, when you think of the two franchises"
12-03-2021T01:16:58,CrRAR,yeah the mechanics are well crafted
12-03-2021T01:18:09,CrRAR,"some of it just feels like a little shoehorned in to pad it out as a game, but it’s a trip"
12-03-2021T01:18:24,Dadrobit,Actors killed it too. Mads Mikkelsen especially.
12-03-2021T01:18:29,CrRAR,oh yeah
12-03-2021T01:18:53,CrRAR,def very character driven
12-03-2021T01:19:45,Dadrobit,"Norman Reedus was a bit rough around the edges, but his character really grew on me around when he started getting comfortable with Lou."
12-03-2021T01:20:23,CrRAR,yeah he just starts out as angsty and detached
12-03-2021T01:22:12,CrRAR,"maybe feels too convenient, but that’s what the game centers on"
12-03-2021T01:23:59,Dadrobit,"I think finishing up school made me put it down. Last I played, I just got to the part where you're climbing the mountains to their peaks and enduring the snow white outs."
12-03-2021T01:25:00,CrRAR,yeah the snow parts get pretty tedious
12-03-2021T01:25:01,Dadrobit,I had just gotten done setting up a giant network of ziplines to navigate them all. Was super proud of it.
12-03-2021T01:26:36,CrRAR,shortcutssss
12-03-2021T01:26:55,Dadrobit,"I love playing support/logistics/healer in games, so helping/creating these giant social works was unreasonably cathartic to me, specially when you get the little popups notifying you that people are using them."
12-03-2021T01:28:26,Dadrobit,That game just pushed all the right buttons for me.
12-03-2021T01:29:02,CrRAR,"yeah just broody exploration, s’got depth to it"
12-03-2021T01:29:49,Dadrobit,"And the sci-fi bridge babit explanation (brain dead mother's premature babies) is so fucking out there, I love it."
12-03-2021T01:29:56,Dadrobit,Babies*
12-03-2021T01:30:35,Dadrobit,That is some properly fucked science fantasy writing.
12-03-2021T01:31:03,CrRAR,"yeah, it’s foreign, but also kinda real with the whole mother/child emotional connection concept"
12-03-2021T01:31:58,Dadrobit,Trapped between life and death to connect with the death stranding souls trapped the same way.
12-03-2021T01:33:14,CrRAR,"I mean some of it is loosely based on folklore stuff, kinda going back to the Japanese concepts where like untimely death and connection to the real world harbor emotions that bring about different kinds of ghosts"
12-03-2021T01:33:54,CrRAR,"like think the grudge, like bad stuff leads to lingering manifestations"
12-03-2021T01:34:23,Dadrobit,I can see that. Kojima loves that kinda stuff in his games.
12-03-2021T01:34:32,CrRAR,so like the harnessing of it in a sci-fi sense turns it into this world-breaking mess
12-03-2021T01:34:47,CrRAR,then you have corporations involved
12-03-2021T01:34:54,CrRAR,and different agendas
12-03-2021T01:35:17,CrRAR,...and then just the original more personal story under all that
12-03-2021T01:36:45,AspiringNoodle,Y'all talking about the potential Kojima horror game :eyes:
12-03-2021T01:37:07,Dadrobit,Death Stranding
12-03-2021T01:37:13,CrRAR,"but yeah it’s an extremely layered game that if you break it apart you can see where the inspirations came from, between SH, P.T. and like kojimas classic pol. thrillerness of like Metal Gear"
12-03-2021T01:37:17,AspiringNoodle,That game is one I want to play
12-03-2021T01:37:59,Dadrobit,"It's a game that isn't for everyone, but for the ones that enjoy it, it's freaking incredible."
12-03-2021T01:38:21,AspiringNoodle,Sounds perfect <3
12-03-2021T01:40:04,AspiringNoodle,"Oh dear God, I wish I paid attention to the name of the person in this WhatCulture video"
12-03-2021T01:40:17,AspiringNoodle,She is absolutely butchering the pronunciation of Sekiro...
12-03-2021T01:40:37,AspiringNoodle,"""Seh-keer-o"" is how she's saying it"
12-03-2021T01:41:30,Dadrobit,Never finished that one. The giant two part ape battle beat me
12-03-2021T01:42:04,Dadrobit,The human on human fight were a work of art. The ape can go fuck itself.
12-03-2021T01:42:10,Dadrobit,Fights*
12-03-2021T01:47:53,SageSaga,gotta get food cooking - brb
12-03-2021T01:48:17,CrRAR,ok k
12-03-2021T01:53:19,SageSaga,cook'n
12-03-2021T01:59:14,SageSaga,done!
12-03-2021T01:59:38,SageSaga,stream over- now i can wallow in my pain - eat food- and then hope the pain goes away so i can sleep!
12-03-2021T01:59:58,AspiringNoodle,What food? :v
12-03-2021T02:00:53,SageSaga,chicken
12-03-2021T02:00:59,SageSaga,nothing special
12-03-2021T02:01:01,Mihari,You forgot the space part.
12-03-2021T02:01:09,Mihari,Unless that's the wallowing
12-03-2021T02:01:10,SageSaga,?
12-03-2021T02:01:17,SageSaga,i might wallow in space
12-03-2021T02:01:17,Mihari,:P
12-03-2021T02:01:20,Mihari,XD
12-03-2021T02:01:27,SageSaga,not sure- might just take this Oxy-
12-03-2021T02:01:45,SageSaga,anyone know how long oxycodone pills last?
12-03-2021T02:02:13,Mihari,four to six hours
12-03-2021T02:02:23,SageSaga,i mean before they expire
12-03-2021T02:02:53,SageSaga,not sure if oxy is one of those pills that goes inert- gets worse- or stays relatively the same with time
12-03-2021T02:05:05,Dadrobit,They lose a minimal amount of effectiveness over the course of many years. But the expiration is mostly to keep people from hanging on to them and throw them out rather than risk them being stolen/sold on the street
12-03-2021T02:10:17,SpazztasticKiwi,well the dirts gone & im feeling bad for what I’ve eat today
12-03-2021T02:10:24,SpazztasticKiwi,sounds about like bedtime
12-03-2021T02:11:28,CrRAR,has chocolate chip muffin
12-03-2021T02:12:13,CrRAR,"oh good all clean, bagheera lives to derp another day"
12-03-2021T02:15:09,CrRAR,<.< maybe one more cup of tea
12-03-2021T02:17:51,Dadrobit,Just got five more hours before work is done for the weekend.
12-03-2021T02:18:26,Dadrobit,Been pulling a ton of overtime this week. I am burned
12-03-2021T02:19:41,Dadrobit,68 hours since Sunday. I'm turning my phone off this weekend.

12-03-2021T14:33:42,AspiringNoodle,Get everything sorted out yesterday?  Or still a lot of uploads to do?
12-03-2021T14:43:20,Twokinds,I'm done for now
12-03-2021T14:49:51,BadFoMo,"Hi, Tom. I love today's sketch."
12-03-2021T14:51:36,Twokinds,Oh thanks
12-03-2021T15:00:24,BadFoMo,"Yo, Sage."
12-03-2021T15:00:27,SageSaga,yo
12-03-2021T15:03:13,Ordithus,yo!
12-03-2021T15:03:22,Ordithus,:eyes: new person
12-03-2021T15:05:33,SageSaga,new person has a very internet name
12-03-2021T15:06:23,sunblaze,hjihi
12-03-2021T15:06:56,Ordithus,hi sun
12-03-2021T15:11:41,BadFoMo,Back. ...Would that name be something like xXxP3n0rL0rd69xXx?
12-03-2021T15:12:10,SageSaga,nah- but his name is Qwerty
12-03-2021T15:12:40,Ordithus,last name Uiop
12-03-2021T15:13:33,SpazztasticKiwi,i got muffins
12-03-2021T15:13:34,BadFoMo,"It is 'Qwerty', or involves the Qwerty keyboard?"
12-03-2021T15:13:40,ZRO4825,Yes.
12-03-2021T15:14:41,SpazztasticKiwi,we’ve been ridiculously busy & they want sandwiches and such made & the wall filled
12-03-2021T15:14:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I only had a coke coffee & me hungry
12-03-2021T15:17:10,ZRO4825,"Does that tool just work better than a normal Fill tool, Sage?"
12-03-2021T15:18:09,SageSaga,it 100% does better than the fill tool
12-03-2021T15:18:22,ZRO4825,Interesting
12-03-2021T15:18:29,SageSaga,lemme see if i can find an example-
12-03-2021T15:18:41,ZRO4825,"Always just looked to me like it just did the same thing, so maybe just hard to tell cuz you use it so frequently, lol"
12-03-2021T15:19:06,SageSaga,hmm not sure if this will work but lets see-
12-03-2021T15:22:28,ZRO4825,Interesting. So it handles border with varying lines differently.
12-03-2021T15:22:40,SageSaga,yeah and is better at hitting gaps
12-03-2021T15:23:02,SageSaga,the fill will stop as soon as it sees a gap coming to prevent it from overflowing
12-03-2021T15:23:14,ZapiliDver,Hi all!
12-03-2021T15:23:18,BadFoMo,Hi.
12-03-2021T15:23:18,SageSaga,which means it can screw up with a line tappers too thin
12-03-2021T15:23:43,SageSaga,while the select and fill will just look at everything in the bounding box as a place to fill
12-03-2021T15:24:09,SageSaga,see?
12-03-2021T15:24:50,BadFoMo,I saw the first little gap.
12-03-2021T15:27:34,Hogan,Afternoonings
12-03-2021T15:27:38,BadFoMo,Yo.

12-03-2021T15:33:42,SageSaga,Mike's chair is like an ergo comfy office chair- Qwerty's is like a lazyboy way too wide chair XD
12-03-2021T15:34:02,Hogan,I dont care what he calls it... I want one!
12-03-2021T15:34:12,ZRO4825,lol
12-03-2021T15:34:42,sunblaze,me too sounds perfect for gaming. does it have a refridgerator build in?
12-03-2021T15:35:04,SageSaga,nah but the replicators are in like every room-
12-03-2021T15:35:18,sunblaze,good enough :ptv-laugh:

12-03-2021T15:35:49,BadFoMo,"Forget the refridgerator, does it have a toilet build in?"
12-03-2021T15:36:07,SageSaga,there are NO TOILETS
12-03-2021T15:36:24,sunblaze,its a scifi gomputergame AU

12-03-2021T15:37:18,ZRO4825,More like it's a game. No one goes potty in games. :P
12-03-2021T15:37:46,SageSaga,but seriously- no one ever has to use the restroom- there are no toilets- only baths in bathing rooms
12-03-2021T15:37:51,sunblaze,that plus as a scifi nerd I am sure Mike knows hoe DUNE handles that theme. its one you do NOT want in a game :P

12-03-2021T17:02:22,BadFoMo,I was /way/ off with my guess's.
12-03-2021T17:03:00,TeapotOfDoom,i think he might be busy with patreon still
12-03-2021T17:14:49,SageSaga,my father wants me to go out to eat with him
12-03-2021T17:15:40,BadFoMo,Go /out/?!
12-03-2021T17:16:24,SageSaga,he's gonna wait for me to finish up more before going
12-03-2021T17:18:46,BadFoMo,"Isn't there something a little, I don't know, /hazerdus to one's health/ going on outside?"
12-03-2021T17:19:55,SageSaga,kinda live in a tiny town- very low contagion rate - and the eateries are all using covid guidelines and requiring masks
12-03-2021T17:20:23,SageSaga,also he's vaccinated too- im the only one at risk :P
12-03-2021T17:20:34,SageSaga,w-wait
12-03-2021T17:20:58,TeapotOfDoom,lol
12-03-2021T17:21:12,Hogan,Sounds like a lot of precautions taken... better beware! XD
12-03-2021T17:21:58,BadFoMo,Just be careful. I want to know how this story ends; in a timely manner.
12-03-2021T17:22:29,Ordithus,please don't die sage
12-03-2021T17:22:40,TeapotOfDoom,^
12-03-2021T17:25:20,Ordithus,on that note I might be getting a vaccine as soon as this week via my employer
12-03-2021T17:25:43,Ordithus,"I feel like it's jumping the line, but I guess they don't care I work from home?"
12-03-2021T17:26:08,SageSaga,whats your job?
12-03-2021T17:26:53,Ordithus,engineer for a company that makes flying thingamajigs
12-03-2021T17:27:11,SageSaga,so is there the chance that you get called up to talk to someone?
12-03-2021T17:28:20,Ordithus,I do have to go in on occasion for my work
12-03-2021T17:28:58,SageSaga,and do ya know which vaccine it is? because if its the Phizer then it makes sense
12-03-2021T17:29:14,Ordithus,I don't know yet
12-03-2021T17:29:17,SageSaga,they will grab other people to take the extras so its not wasted
12-03-2021T17:29:28,Hogan,"I'm in construction engineering, I've been out and about all through the year, checking on sites and meeting customers... masked up and keeping distance :-|"
12-03-2021T17:30:54,SageSaga,they might just be including you so they have an extra engineer they can call in for in person stuff if needed
12-03-2021T17:31:05,SageSaga,precautionary measures
12-03-2021T17:32:33,Ordithus,afaik so far it's just everyone at the company
12-03-2021T17:33:08,Ordithus,"details were light, I'm expecting more info this week"
12-03-2021T17:33:22,Ordithus,but if it's true... :ptv-excited:
12-03-2021T17:33:25,SageSaga,well they are getting a lot more in atm- they have ramped up massively
12-03-2021T17:33:31,TeapotOfDoom,you make flying thingimajigs?
12-03-2021T17:33:57,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,he is making flying elephants
12-03-2021T17:34:13,SageSaga,they are saying its possible we will have been able to give everyone it by July 4th- its more an issue now of getting everyone to take it
12-03-2021T17:34:13,Ordithus,"I don't build them myself! Other people do that bit. Design, analysis, test."
12-03-2021T17:34:44,TeapotOfDoom,i wish we were at that point
12-03-2021T17:35:01,TeapotOfDoom,we're having nothing but trouble with the astra zeneca trash
12-03-2021T17:35:23,TeapotOfDoom,i wish they would get more phizer going
12-03-2021T17:39:17,SageSaga,that ones a hard one to produce though
12-03-2021T17:40:46,TeapotOfDoom,i know but it's still way better. astra zeneca claimed that people would react to their stuff with fever and similar with a probability below 10%. we're seeing up to 70%
12-03-2021T17:40:55,SageSaga,yikes
12-03-2021T17:41:04,SageSaga,any other major issues with it?
12-03-2021T17:41:43,TeapotOfDoom,it knocked out several medical fascilites cus they all vaccinated at the same time not knowing the consequences
12-03-2021T17:42:00,TeapotOfDoom,so nearly the entire staff got sick
12-03-2021T17:42:29,SageSaga,yikes
12-03-2021T17:42:43,TeapotOfDoom,at least nothing really dangerous per se but it has been handled very poorly
12-03-2021T17:42:56,SageSaga,and that was the one that was supposed to go open source too wasnt it?
12-03-2021T17:43:14,TeapotOfDoom,and if i were a health administration i would have revoked their license for that alone. you just can't fake numbers like that
12-03-2021T17:43:27,TeapotOfDoom,not sure
12-03-2021T17:43:39,TeapotOfDoom,also it only has a protection rate of ~60%
12-03-2021T17:43:42,SageSaga,was it the one Oxford helped develope?
12-03-2021T17:43:45,TeapotOfDoom,phizer has 94
12-03-2021T17:43:49,TeapotOfDoom,i think so
12-03-2021T17:43:57,TeapotOfDoom,it's a vector based vaccine
12-03-2021T17:44:26,TeapotOfDoom,btw afaik it doesn't have a license in the usa
12-03-2021T17:44:54,SageSaga,i dont know if you knew this but originally Oxford said their vaccine would be open source for anyone to make to help people all over the world-
12-03-2021T17:45:06,SageSaga,when suddenly they decided not to-
12-03-2021T17:45:14,TeapotOfDoom,moneyyyy~~
12-03-2021T17:45:25,TeapotOfDoom,just too sweet not to take it
12-03-2021T17:45:45,TeapotOfDoom,probably not even the researchers who made that desicion
12-03-2021T17:46:44,TeapotOfDoom,i hope i can get some of that mrna based stuff at some point. best thing we got so far
12-03-2021T17:47:55,TeapotOfDoom,"anyway, how's dnd going?"
12-03-2021T17:50:50,SageSaga,Thursday game went great- Saturday game went pretty well - Mihari walked into a gelatinous cube and got herself out using a decanter of endless water
12-03-2021T17:51:51,TeapotOfDoom,oh boi cubes xD did the cube explode or did it get washed away?
12-03-2021T17:52:01,Hogan,"Awright, gonna see my bed about some sleep :-)"
12-03-2021T17:52:07,TeapotOfDoom,o/ hogan
12-03-2021T17:52:12,Hogan,"Thanks for the stream Sage, and thanks for the company everyone! :-)"
12-03-2021T17:52:58,Ordithus,night hogan
12-03-2021T17:53:10,Ordithus,:eyes: new fella has interesting eyes
12-03-2021T17:53:20,TeapotOfDoom,sparkly
12-03-2021T17:54:12,TeapotOfDoom,in our last game i got messed up by a quickling
12-03-2021T17:54:39,TeapotOfDoom,as kind of a revenge because i found out i can get a lot of rations by setting off shatter in a lake
12-03-2021T17:54:41,SageSaga,im done!
12-03-2021T17:54:49,SageSaga,night Hogan!

12-03-2021T19:42:21,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,I asked bout it in chat earlier tryin to remind Tom
12-03-2021T19:46:05,Twokinds,"It's a little late, I think I'm going to continue drawing sketches from the omnipoll"
12-03-2021T19:46:48,Twokinds,Things are a little upside down at the moment
12-03-2021T19:48:04,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,okay Tom
12-03-2021T19:48:50,Ordithus,aight
12-03-2021T19:49:19,Twokinds,Still have no word back from Patreon whether my actions have been sufficiant.
12-03-2021T19:49:40,Ordithus,ugh
12-03-2021T19:55:46,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,are you going to run polls off the omnipoll's suggestion pool?
12-03-2021T19:56:46,Roughlandin,Bleck patreon. What do they have a problem with now?
12-03-2021T19:56:56,TeapotOfDoom,nudity
12-03-2021T19:57:10,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,buncha prudes
12-03-2021T19:57:12,Roughlandin,...Wat
12-03-2021T19:57:30,TeapotOfDoom,they unleashed a bot which flags posts for nudity
12-03-2021T19:57:34,TeapotOfDoom,and yes fur counts
12-03-2021T19:57:37,Roughlandin,Bish where?
12-03-2021T19:57:48,TeapotOfDoom,so all posts need to be patreon only or you get the beatin
12-03-2021T19:58:08,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Tom mirrored a bunch of his posts onto devient art yesterday
12-03-2021T19:58:31,Roughlandin,Do they just... not like money?
12-03-2021T19:58:43,TeapotOfDoom,probably got bullied by investors
12-03-2021T19:58:44,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,no they just made them paywalled
12-03-2021T19:58:53,TeapotOfDoom,at least my guess
12-03-2021T19:59:19,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,yeah
12-03-2021T19:59:24,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,probably that
12-03-2021T19:59:52,Roughlandin,What do their investors think people use their site for?
12-03-2021T20:00:07,TeapotOfDoom,nudity = porn = BAD
12-03-2021T20:00:13,Roughlandin,Ugh... frickin normies
12-03-2021T20:00:22,TeapotOfDoom,no porn in my christian investment projects
12-03-2021T20:00:26,Roughlandin,Sorry Tom
12-03-2021T20:00:38,CrRAR,yeah it just boils down to corporate optics

12-03-2021T20:02:31,Roughlandin,You didn't have to delete anything?
12-03-2021T20:02:34,TeapotOfDoom,i love that the preview is mage kat
12-03-2021T20:02:49,Twokinds,Yeah it's just made Patrons Only
12-03-2021T20:03:29,Roughlandin,Coolio! Sorry you had to deal with all that
12-03-2021T20:04:17,Twokinds,I just don't like having an axe hanging over my head all the time.
12-03-2021T20:04:48,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,Sorry for this Patreon Corporate crud Tom.
12-03-2021T20:04:51,Roughlandin,It's bull. They're playing with people's livelihoods
12-03-2021T20:06:08,TeapotOfDoom,yeah there's been a lot of that lately and it's concerning
12-03-2021T20:06:33,Roughlandin,"They say subscribestar is less rigid about stuff like that, but I can understand why you'd want to stick with the place you already have set up. Migrating sites like that can be tricky"
12-03-2021T20:07:47,SpazztasticKiwi,you can’t have sexy curves
12-03-2021T20:07:50,SpazztasticKiwi,it’s lewd
12-03-2021T20:07:55,SpazztasticKiwi,what about the children
12-03-2021T20:07:58,TeapotOfDoom,:cteapotofdoom-hyperkeith:
12-03-2021T20:08:02,SpazztasticKiwi,people could have impure thoughts
12-03-2021T20:08:14,Roughlandin,What about the sexy straight lines?
12-03-2021T20:09:10,SpazztasticKiwi,what? Flora?
12-03-2021T20:09:16,TeapotOfDoom,OOF

12-03-2021T20:09:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I can say it cause I’m in the same boat
12-03-2021T20:10:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I heard it best said by this lady in the breakroom who was talking about breastfeeding
12-03-2021T20:11:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"it goes for artistic anatomy work, ie drawing bodies"
12-03-2021T20:11:57,Roughlandin,"Meh. Size ain't everything. I have yet to meet a hetero man who said ""no thank you"" to boobs."
12-03-2021T20:12:12,SpazztasticKiwi,some folks can differentiate “that’s a body part” or “that’s a woman feeding her baby” but others just go “oooh titties!”
12-03-2021T20:12:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I almost hurt myself laughing at the lady that day when she said that
12-03-2021T20:13:20,Roughlandin,Western society has a lot of weird repression tied up around breasts
12-03-2021T20:13:59,Roughlandin,"It's probably Kellog's fault. Thanks, cornflakes!"
12-03-2021T20:14:46,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,shoulda just made BoobFlakes instead
12-03-2021T20:14:46,SpazztasticKiwi,with this btching about masks I don’t wanna hear not a soul say anything about a woman covering herself to breastfeed
12-03-2021T20:15:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll throw the heaviest thing I can pick up at their skull

12-03-2021T20:19:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom usually doesn’t allow that topic
12-03-2021T20:20:30,CrRAR,the grumpy voice sounds a bit like cookie monster
12-03-2021T20:20:51,CrRAR,I guess he’s moved on from cookies

12-03-2021T20:22:40,Roughlandin,Makes sense lol. Avenue Q is basically a dirty Sesame Street parody
12-03-2021T20:23:34,CrRAR,haha
12-03-2021T20:23:50,CrRAR,ah yeah thats just a bit of a name play
12-03-2021T20:28:37,CrRAR,Just watched Penguin Highway after sage mentioned it
12-03-2021T20:28:57,CrRAR,kind of a more whimsical donnie darko vibe to it
12-03-2021T20:29:56,SpazztasticKiwi,ew don’t remind me
12-03-2021T20:31:49,CrRAR,more so just the whole “what is even happening” for the duration of the movie feeling
12-03-2021T20:33:39,Mediawatcher,So is there no sketch suggestions this week?
12-03-2021T20:33:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Toms been swamped
12-03-2021T20:34:07,Mediawatcher,"Makes sense, I’m guessing it has to do with patreon"
12-03-2021T20:34:15,CrRAR,yeah he said he’s still even working on the omni sketches today
12-03-2021T20:34:33,CrRAR,yep
12-03-2021T20:34:45,Mediawatcher,What has patreon been doing to him?
12-03-2021T20:35:00,CrRAR,they’re being censor-y
12-03-2021T20:35:13,Mediawatcher,"Oh, I wonder which ones got censored"
12-03-2021T20:35:27,CrRAR,worried about non-patreon only posts that have nudity basically
12-03-2021T20:35:32,Snowmanwizard,:ctwokinds-KatDance::ctwokinds-FloDance: = bad
12-03-2021T20:35:38,BadFoMo,All nudity is now Adults Only content.
12-03-2021T20:36:03,Mediawatcher,"I kind of get that, but even then in two kinds case it’s not that inappropriate"
12-03-2021T20:36:15,BadFoMo,Even the stuff that doesn't show anything!
12-03-2021T20:36:29,CrRAR,the mirrored content tom shared a link to is here on dA:

12-03-2021T20:37:15,Mediawatcher,Are those the ones that got censored?
12-03-2021T20:37:24,BadFoMo,Yes.
12-03-2021T20:37:32,CrRAR,yeah it’s silly
12-03-2021T20:37:39,Ordithus,anything and everything with nudity or suggestion at all
12-03-2021T20:37:44,Mediawatcher,A lot of these aren’t even that bad!
12-03-2021T20:37:59,CrRAR,especially compared to even other content on patreon overall anyway
12-03-2021T20:38:00,CrRAR,yeah
12-03-2021T20:38:11,Mediawatcher,Yeesh guess we’re gonna have to skip suggestions this week
12-03-2021T20:38:22,Mediawatcher,What a shame
12-03-2021T20:38:34,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles: will it be the fabled Tom pick only strem?
12-03-2021T20:38:51,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,I hope there will be votes
12-03-2021T20:39:03,TheFriendlyDeathclaw,but either way is good
12-03-2021T20:39:41,BadFoMo,"I don't know for a fact, but I guess Pareon is being veg about this new no nudity thing and Tom is saying ""Better safe than sorry.""."
12-03-2021T20:39:51,CrRAR,yeah
12-03-2021T20:39:52,Mediawatcher,Maybe it’ll just be a Tom week
12-03-2021T20:40:04,BadFoMo,...Like the Crazy Church Guy.
12-03-2021T20:40:24,CrRAR,mostly just means more things posted behind the patreon veil
12-03-2021T20:40:27,CrRAR,and dA
12-03-2021T20:40:38,BadFoMo,I look forword to a pick only stream.
12-03-2021T20:41:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn’t get a sketch in for the last week
12-03-2021T20:41:27,Mediawatcher,I wouldn’t mind having a Tom only week
12-03-2021T20:41:41,Mediawatcher,At least the sketches are still intact on patreon
12-03-2021T20:41:57,Mediawatcher,Little weird for some of them to be adults only when many of them aren’t even that bad
12-03-2021T20:42:29,CrRAR,"eh, seems like they just want publically accessible stuff to be more tame"
12-03-2021T20:43:02,CrRAR,tom just likes it to be free-and-fair
12-03-2021T20:43:08,Mediawatcher,"Stuff like mean girls and women’s bath I get, but not all of them are like that"
12-03-2021T20:43:12,CrRAR,meanies at patreon
12-03-2021T20:43:17,CrRAR,lol
12-03-2021T20:43:42,Mediawatcher,Freaking patreon
12-03-2021T20:46:49,CrRAR,"it is kinda confusing, because in-general this means that public side patreons could be ribbons and unicorns and the tiers could just be you know, whatever xD"
12-03-2021T20:46:58,CrRAR,:ptv-uneasy:
12-03-2021T20:47:05,CrRAR,...but I guess that’s what tier descriptions are for

12-03-2021T21:37:02,Roughlandin,I guess people who post pics of their dogs and stuff are going to have to watch out
12-03-2021T21:39:24,Roughlandin,Welp. I was gonna repost my omnipoll suggestion from last week anyway. See everybody tomorrow! Don't forget to set your clocks forward!
