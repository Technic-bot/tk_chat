17-02-2021T16:17:47,CrRAR,yeah this winter is especially an isitoveryet one
17-02-2021T16:19:24,CrRAR,lots of being positively uneventful then just winter seems to remember that it's winter
17-02-2021T16:20:11,CrRAR,better so far than 3-feet of-snow-in-February year though
17-02-2021T16:20:55,CrRAR,birds singing lately seems like cruel mockery
17-02-2021T17:11:58,CrRAR,I might protest the horrible weather outdoors by baking some brownies
17-02-2021T17:12:10,CrRAR,seems appropriate comeuppance
17-02-2021T17:12:39,CrRAR,"sweet, sweet chocolate vengance"

17-02-2021T17:23:42,CrRAR,it suggests like a fruity filling though
17-02-2021T17:23:52,CrRAR,raspberry might not be bad
17-02-2021T17:24:04,CrRAR,but plain vanilla please otherwise

17-02-2021T18:57:10,CrimsonQuill086,So a funny mini-comic joke I drew turned into a back-and-forth about coping and past wounds of OCs with my fave Twitter Halo artist XD
17-02-2021T18:57:21,CrimsonQuill086,Kinda got a life of it's own

17-02-2021T19:17:44,CrimsonQuill086,Also realizing the horror I have visited by moving over 1500 Twokinds pictures into photos at once XD
17-02-2021T19:17:54,NinoGD,oof
17-02-2021T19:20:42,NinoGD,I thought the Wacom Cintiq 16 was smaller
17-02-2021T19:22:30,CrimsonQuill086,"Well, 16'' is certainly bigger than my 13''...I'd guess that the extra space really adds up."
17-02-2021T19:22:39,NinoGD,Yeah
17-02-2021T19:23:09,NinoGD,I still need to adjust to digital art

17-02-2021T19:55:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I watched Se√°n‚Äôs hearing test video
17-02-2021T19:56:15,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äú‚Äòit‚Äôs uncommon for anyone over 18 to hear this frequency‚Äô ok let‚Äôs see if I can hear this‚Äù ~plays video~
17-02-2021T19:56:24,SpazztasticKiwi,me: turnitoff

17-02-2021T19:57:09,SpazztasticKiwi,aaaahhturnitoff
17-02-2021T20:00:21,CrRAR,I used to be able to hear the low whine CRTs and dimmed lightbults gave off. I don't know if my hearing is still as sensitive.
17-02-2021T20:00:31,CrRAR,sounds like a good way to test tho
17-02-2021T20:01:37,SpazztasticKiwi,one test told him his hearing is 42
17-02-2021T20:01:41,SpazztasticKiwi,he‚Äôs 31
17-02-2021T20:03:00,SpazztasticKiwi,he did go to the dr already before & they said he has no damage despite the tinnitus
17-02-2021T20:03:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"it is going to get to the point where he‚Äôs not gonna hear what he used to, Marks test was close to the same"
17-02-2021T20:04:40,CrRAR,"well, they do say that ears just naturally lose that sensitivity over time"
17-02-2021T20:04:51,CrRAR,just like eyes and detailed vision
17-02-2021T20:05:35,CrRAR,Baby Driver: the movie that makes tinnitus a character defining plot-point
17-02-2021T20:05:45,CrRAR,t'was a decent movie
17-02-2021T20:06:27,CrRAR,one of the last Kevin Spacy movies before his reputation completely imploded as well
17-02-2021T20:06:49,CrRAR,"plays the bad guy too, kinda poetic"

17-02-2021T20:10:56,SonOfGoku,Do it
17-02-2021T20:13:47,CrRAR,both those movies both have such great soundtracks too
17-02-2021T20:13:53,CrRAR,tis a good matchup

17-02-2021T21:41:43,CrRAR,some possibilities more harrowing than others
17-02-2021T21:54:33,Ordithus,"CrRAR, the movie Signs is a good test if you can hear the CRT noise"
