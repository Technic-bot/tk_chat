03-02-2021T00:32:48,CrRAR,just browsing random house listings and this one condo has a picture of a tiny koala in a bathtub:

03-02-2021T00:33:02,CrRAR,would totally pay extra to keep it
03-02-2021T00:34:03,CrRAR,*show up to open house*
03-02-2021T00:34:07,CrRAR,"""uhh, is JUST the koala for sale?"""

03-02-2021T06:57:34,CrimsonQuill086,Morning
03-02-2021T06:57:50,CrimsonQuill086,Or rather...afternoon.
03-02-2021T07:02:54,TerraTheWizard,you said that just before noon so that was accurate
03-02-2021T07:03:52,CrimsonQuill086,"Fair enough, hello there Terra!"
03-02-2021T07:10:44,CrimsonQuill086,"I've taken the liberty of adding some numbers to my username. Thankfully, this one I'm sticking with...Picarto literally won't let me do it after this."
03-02-2021T07:16:10,AspiringNoodle,"Oh yeah, their ridiculous ""only 2 name changes per account"" policy >_>"
03-02-2021T07:16:20,AspiringNoodle,That's why I made this account with my old email that I don't use anymore.
03-02-2021T07:16:42,AspiringNoodle,"So when I finally decide on a new name, I can use my current one without penalty <3"
03-02-2021T07:17:49,CrimsonQuill086,"I actually like the consistency. Also, hello Noodle."
03-02-2021T07:21:09,AspiringNoodle,:snake:
03-02-2021T07:21:25,AspiringNoodle,"I have this thing where I don't like ""lifetime"" systems"
03-02-2021T07:22:49,AspiringNoodle,"Being more generous with how often stuff can happen, or limiting how often it can happen are much more preferable to me."
03-02-2021T07:23:21,AspiringNoodle,But Picarto's policy seems very restrictive.
03-02-2021T07:36:42,CrimsonQuill086,Time for lunch. Toodle-oo for now.

03-02-2021T18:02:34,CrRAR,"no, supposedly snow showers I think over the weekend"
03-02-2021T18:03:28,CrRAR,I'm not quite ready yet to be shoveling and or snow taking any horizontal surface again in the vicinity yet

03-02-2021T21:34:53,CrRAR,"ah, okey"
03-02-2021T21:34:58,CrRAR,:tea:
03-02-2021T21:38:39,CrRAR,finally got my u.a. youtooz ship notice :3
03-02-2021T21:38:51,CrRAR,"collectables, soon come~"
03-02-2021T22:03:24,AspiringNoodle,"Attempted some deliveries today, haha"
03-02-2021T22:03:30,AspiringNoodle,Yeah... I got no offers worth my time.
03-02-2021T22:03:56,AspiringNoodle,I'll chalk it up to I tried on a Thursday after 6pm.
03-02-2021T22:43:36,CrRAR,were they too far to be worth it?
03-02-2021T23:01:29,AspiringNoodle,definitely
03-02-2021T23:01:49,AspiringNoodle,We're talking 25 - 35 minute drives just to get to the stores
03-02-2021T23:02:07,AspiringNoodle,"So, around 20 - 25 miles or so"
03-02-2021T23:02:47,AspiringNoodle,"There was only one worth doing potentially because it was a $24 double order, BUT it was delivery-only.  So I'd drive to the store, pick them up, then make the drops."
03-02-2021T23:03:57,AspiringNoodle,"My understanding is:  Yeah, you might get a huge tax write-off for driving a bunch of miles"
03-02-2021T23:04:12,AspiringNoodle,"But unless you make enough money to be taxed more than you can deduce, you're effectively screwing yourself"
03-02-2021T23:25:16,CrRAR,yeah double and combo runs probably the way to go if ya can
