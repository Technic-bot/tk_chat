31-12-2017T20:59:46,LeKnightWolf,doing ok
31-12-2017T21:09:41,Combak,"So, definitely no stream tonight."
31-12-2017T21:16:45,unsteddyphoenix,"Now that you've said that, he gon' stram."
31-12-2017T21:17:57,Combak,"I mean, he said his hand was too cold to draw about 2 hours ago, so... you know... infer."
31-12-2017T21:33:17,Bgrmystr2,He said he was pulling out a heater to warm his hands so he COULD draw.
31-12-2017T21:33:26,Bgrmystr2,but none of that infers anything about stream vs no stream :P
31-12-2017T21:33:34,DevlNuK,xD
31-12-2017T21:33:36,Bgrmystr2,"picking straws, really."
31-12-2017T21:33:57,Bgrmystr2,No big deal either way. :)
31-12-2017T21:36:10,Combak,"It means he was attempting to draw. If he was going to stream, he would be drawing. Since that was a while ago, he has probably started drawing. Since he is not streaming, we can assume he will not be streaming his drawing."
31-12-2017T21:37:00,Bgrmystr2,not exactly. He draws before he streams on Wed and Fri.
31-12-2017T21:37:12,Bgrmystr2,so that's not really relevant
31-12-2017T21:39:32,Combak,... Meh.
