14-05-2018T00:17:35,Trevuxnouxe,:ptv-sad:
14-05-2018T12:27:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Today I woke up and nearly pushed Bagheera off the bed
14-05-2018T12:46:47,BadFoMo,I think I've had moments like that.
14-05-2018T12:51:58,SpazztasticKiwi,He normally sleeps on my right against the wall but he was on my left on the edge of the bed
14-05-2018T13:03:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m currently trying to stay entertained while on an hour drive to the airport
14-05-2018T14:07:30,Xexanoth,if you wanna stay entertained just imagine: Keith and Natani as Otakus dating each others Body Pillow
14-05-2018T16:25:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll tell you what’s entertaining: this guy has his two kids with him and effectively ignoring that they’re fussing at each other

14-05-2018T18:34:20,BluePhantom90,hey Tom
14-05-2018T18:36:25,Dadrobit,"Mmmmm, speaking of Tom, currently chilling some sichuan and cinnamon infused curry gelatin cubes for dinner tomorrow."
14-05-2018T18:37:08,Dadrobit,You convinced me to finally make a curry dish.
14-05-2018T18:37:32,Dadrobit,Mama Fischbach uses the Golden Curry stuff right?
14-05-2018T18:45:44,Twokinds,Yep!
14-05-2018T18:45:59,Twokinds,The spicy variety
14-05-2018T18:51:32,Dadrobit,Gonna stuff the cubes in some oversized meatballs on noodles w/ tofu and peppered pork.
14-05-2018T18:51:50,Dadrobit,Hoping for the best.
14-05-2018T18:52:15,unsteddyphoenix,...what?
14-05-2018T18:52:17,unsteddyphoenix,Take a picture
14-05-2018T18:54:26,Dadrobit,"Lol, not much to take a picture of right now, just chilling the curry so it hardens and becomes easier to handle when stuffing the meatballs."
14-05-2018T18:55:14,Dadrobit,Gonna actually cook it tomorrow. Today I've been slow cooking a chili since 6am.
14-05-2018T18:56:50,unsteddyphoenix,I need closure on the curry balls 'cause honestly it sounds delicious.
14-05-2018T19:02:12,Dadrobit,"Well, I can't do that for you for another day, but here's some home made chili for ya. https://i.imgur.com/eJmfyBH.jpg"
14-05-2018T19:02:57,CrRAR,That... is a delicious looking mess.
14-05-2018T19:04:02,unsteddyphoenix,A hot mess
14-05-2018T19:07:54,Dadrobit,"Bell peppers, chili peppers, corn, tomatoes, potatoes, beef, beans, seasonings for days."
14-05-2018T19:08:12,Dadrobit,"oh, onions too."
14-05-2018T19:08:27,Dadrobit,A literal hot mess.
14-05-2018T19:09:19,Dadrobit,Gonna strain out the excess broth and use it for other activities.
14-05-2018T19:10:15,Dadrobit,"Fish stick burritos and taco omelette memes aside, I do try to make legitimately tasty foods."
14-05-2018T19:15:01,unsteddyphoenix,Heh. That was a good burrito
14-05-2018T19:19:50,unsteddyphoenix,What should I do to improve my ramen
14-05-2018T19:26:59,Dadrobit,"Add a meat to it. Fish is quick, but pretty much anything works."
14-05-2018T19:27:08,Dadrobit,Eggs work really well too.
14-05-2018T19:28:56,unsteddyphoenix,Tuna? :thinking:
14-05-2018T19:29:10,Bgrmystr2,that img is ew ;x
14-05-2018T19:29:30,CrRAR,Throw some capers in there.
14-05-2018T19:31:05,Dadrobit,"I mean, a tuna filet would probably be fine. But if you're talking canned and pre-cooked tuna... You might have a bad time."
14-05-2018T19:31:34,unsteddyphoenix,I'll play it safe with egg
14-05-2018T19:32:08,CrRAR,solid
14-05-2018T19:42:20,Dadrobit,Pls report with opinion when you decide to take the egg plunge.
14-05-2018T19:44:03,Dadrobit,"Pulled a small bowl of the chili and added some freshly diced jalapenos, very tasty."
14-05-2018T19:47:29,Bgrmystr2,"When I glanced at that a min ago, I thought you said ""Pls report with onion"""
14-05-2018T19:47:36,Bgrmystr2,and I just.. :thinking:
14-05-2018T19:51:44,unsteddyphoenix,Just scrambled the egg and mixed it in. Sgood though
14-05-2018T23:59:41,SiliconCarbide,"of the keidran cast, who can read? just kat and raine?"
