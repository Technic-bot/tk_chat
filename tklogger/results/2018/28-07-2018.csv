28-07-2018T15:15:35,HeresyArtStream,A good compromise between reboot Lara and classic Lara

28-07-2018T15:17:07,Tharkis,i think tomb raider 3 was the last one i played
28-07-2018T15:17:07,HeresyArtStream,I am just sucking in a bunch of art with my eyes. X3
28-07-2018T15:17:19,Tharkis,too darned many tomb raider games and a lot of them got real bad
28-07-2018T15:17:26,FoxxTrotter,"Have two, bringing up a third."
28-07-2018T15:17:32,Tharkis,"damn, tomb raider 3 is 20 years old already =/"
28-07-2018T15:17:34,Tharkis,now i feel old
28-07-2018T15:17:37,HeresyArtStream,Tomb Raider 1 through 3 were fine
28-07-2018T15:17:44,sunblaze,3 had the best endboss
28-07-2018T15:17:45,Tharkis,"yeah 3 was fine, though a bit repetitive"
28-07-2018T15:17:47,sunblaze,mutant spider :D
28-07-2018T15:17:48,HeresyArtStream,All the rest of the Core Team games were bad
28-07-2018T15:17:56,TorqueEmUp,and the latest ones are better IMO
28-07-2018T15:18:00,BadFoMo,Sketch request; Tomb Raider Kathrin 'Nude Cheat'?
28-07-2018T15:18:10,HeresyArtStream,TR3 was right before franchise fatigue started kicking in.
28-07-2018T15:18:18,ThingsAreMoving,"Tomb raider was a pixellated monstrosity, untill voodoo released their graphics accelerator"
28-07-2018T15:18:23,sunblaze,kathrin uses xian-dagger and tf's into reni?
28-07-2018T15:18:23,vevans0009,More fishgirl?
28-07-2018T15:18:26,ThingsAreMoving,the first one i mean
28-07-2018T15:18:27,HeresyArtStream,The formula was good enough that they kept it going for 3 games without much trouble but it failed to evolve.
28-07-2018T15:18:31,Twokinds,I never played any of the Tomb Raider games
28-07-2018T15:18:37,Tharkis,dual voodoo2 daisy chained together baby !

28-07-2018T15:18:50,HeresyArtStream,When they finally tried updating with Angel of Darkness it was a broken mess and didn't even know what made Tomb Raider fun in the first place.
28-07-2018T15:18:53,CrimsonHelsing,I never played them either xP
28-07-2018T15:18:54,BadFoMo,I think I played a demo in WalMart.
28-07-2018T15:18:56,TorqueEmUp,But played the first of the reboot
28-07-2018T15:19:01,TorqueEmUp,Really good
28-07-2018T15:19:03,HeresyArtStream,Then Crystal Dynamics took over and made Tomb Raider fun again
28-07-2018T15:19:13,unsteddyphoenix,alli remember from tomb raider is getting stuck in a cave with a tiger

28-07-2018T15:20:01,HeresyArtStream,Crystal Dynamics' first three TR games were really good. They were like classic Tomb Raider except with fun control and better level design.

28-07-2018T15:33:11,QuinnAuer,And I don't mean how they tried to make a franchise out of it
28-07-2018T15:33:14,SpazztasticKiwi,The Meg
28-07-2018T15:33:18,thestooge,"Which in my opinion helps the effects, SO many practial effects are ruined because of color correction"

28-07-2018T16:32:47,Corinthian,"I'd like to go to a comic con and furry con, but I'm broke and insecure."
28-07-2018T16:32:58,Bgrmystr2,"how was it, compared to an anime con?"
28-07-2018T16:33:38,Tharkis,"pretty darned close TBH, basically it was like an anime con, but instead of cosplayers of all sorts"
28-07-2018T16:33:42,Tharkis,all the cosplayers were fursuiters
28-07-2018T16:33:46,ThingsAreMoving,Corinthian fix the being broke part and you're good to go
28-07-2018T16:33:52,Mippy,I'd like to go...But all the ones   you guys talk about are out of country

28-07-2018T16:34:58,ThingsAreMoving,haveing a friend with you helps a lot but it's not required
28-07-2018T16:34:59,Tharkis,and discover that you've got something to talk about

28-07-2018T17:16:11,ThingsAreMoving,"and it causes you to salivate more, which helps spread flavours"

28-07-2018T18:23:32,ProsePro7,He swam the Panama Canal
28-07-2018T18:23:36,Darkewulf,that's the fastest way to swim from the Pacific to the Atlantic (or vice-versa)
28-07-2018T18:23:50,Ordithus,Largest body of water I've been in is Lake Superior.  Cold.
28-07-2018T18:23:58,CrRAR,mmm

28-07-2018T18:24:40,FoxxTrotter,I used to be 20 minutes from Lake Ontario.
28-07-2018T18:24:47,CrRAR,"No, but I have heard the song."
28-07-2018T18:24:53,Ordithus,"No, I have not.  Can you actually swim to that?  I thought it was way out there, and deep."
28-07-2018T18:24:55,FoxxTrotter,That lake is COLD all year. XP
28-07-2018T18:24:56,10chaos1,"or maybe the ""people"" at patreon don't like tom for some reason"

28-07-2018T18:33:10,ThingsAreMoving,Mars also has earth
28-07-2018T18:33:13,ThingsAreMoving,i suppose
28-07-2018T18:33:19,goldgardian,"did you ever hear about a bunch of belgium soldiers.. like 50 or so, held off the majority of the german wehrmacht in ww2? Sabaton wrote a song about it and everything"

28-07-2018T18:33:59,10chaos1,gold i was listening to that earlier
28-07-2018T18:34:11,SiliconCarbide,strudel comes from austria

28-07-2018T18:34:35,ThingsAreMoving,not necessarily
28-07-2018T18:34:38,CrimsonHelsing,salt water
28-07-2018T18:34:39,unsteddyphoenix,^
28-07-2018T18:34:39,ShadowSoap,Nah.
28-07-2018T18:34:42,totallynotTrace,not if its salty
28-07-2018T18:34:55,totallynotTrace,salt lowers the freezing point of water
28-07-2018T18:35:02,ThingsAreMoving,even if it's sweet it needs a lot of time to freeze
28-07-2018T18:35:11,qwe304,only by a few degrees
28-07-2018T18:35:17,10chaos1,lol
28-07-2018T18:35:19,totallynotTrace,true
28-07-2018T18:35:28,CrimsonHelsing,even then it's mostly gonna remain liquid
28-07-2018T18:35:41,unsteddyphoenix,oceans dont normally freeze
28-07-2018T18:35:48,Ordithus,It takes a long time for even a lake to freeze
28-07-2018T18:35:49,ShadowSoap,"Eh, physics need not apply."
28-07-2018T18:35:55,ThingsAreMoving,if your oceans freeze you need to restart earth
28-07-2018T18:35:57,qwe304,then again do we even know if salt exists?

28-07-2018T18:36:11,Z3ppl1n,oceans cant freeze
28-07-2018T18:36:14,unsteddyphoenix,:thinking:
28-07-2018T18:36:17,Z3ppl1n,due to the salt watere
28-07-2018T18:36:21,Z3ppl1n,water*
28-07-2018T18:36:24,ShadowSoap,Qwe with the real questions.
28-07-2018T18:36:27,unsteddyphoenix,do we even know if water exists?
28-07-2018T18:36:35,unsteddyphoenix,maybe its all blue gatorade
28-07-2018T18:36:39,ShadowSoap,o.O

28-07-2018T18:36:43,ThingsAreMoving,stop with the jaden memes
28-07-2018T18:36:48,totallynotTrace,dont ask a chemist that. they will get salty
28-07-2018T18:36:49,qwe304,no water is confirmed
28-07-2018T18:36:49,MviluUatusun,"Z3ppl1n, have you ever heard of the Arctic Ocean?  It freezes every winter."
28-07-2018T18:37:04,Mippy,Not entirely
28-07-2018T18:37:13,SageSaga,"=_= Salt water can freeze, just at lower temperatures"
28-07-2018T18:37:18,ThingsAreMoving,^
28-07-2018T18:37:19,unsteddyphoenix,oh ok. water yes saltwater hard maybe
28-07-2018T18:37:21,Z3ppl1n,thats cause its extremely shallow for an ocean
28-07-2018T18:37:26,MviluUatusun,"Buzackly, Sage."
28-07-2018T18:37:27,CrRAR,Salt delays freezing.
28-07-2018T18:37:29,Ordithus,Fun fact: brine (very salty water) freezes at 0 F
28-07-2018T18:37:43,Z3ppl1n,there isnt much water movement from othe parts of the worl their either
28-07-2018T18:37:43,ThingsAreMoving,depends on the salinity Ord
28-07-2018T18:37:45,ShadowSoap,Thanks for the fact
28-07-2018T18:37:49,CrRAR,"yeah, like, lowers freezing temp"
28-07-2018T18:37:53,Ordithus,As salty as it can get
28-07-2018T18:38:06,unsteddyphoenix,"So F isnt ENTIRELY worthless, neat"

28-07-2018T18:38:21,ThingsAreMoving,we're taking the pressure into consideration?
28-07-2018T18:38:22,SiliconCarbide,fahrenheit is the bane of my existence
28-07-2018T18:38:25,qwe304,"either way, the saltwater would melt/absorb the snow right?"
28-07-2018T18:38:28,totallynotTrace,"in a way z3p has a point. the top layer could freeze but deeper sections wont. so the ENTIRE ocean wont freezze, but some could"
28-07-2018T18:38:30,Z3ppl1n,yes
28-07-2018T18:38:40,unsteddyphoenix,what if its saltsnow
28-07-2018T18:38:40,CrRAR,true
28-07-2018T18:38:42,ShadowSoap,That is why some sand is exposed.
28-07-2018T18:38:43,ThingsAreMoving,"yes, qwe. that's why you can see the sand in the picture"
28-07-2018T18:38:58,CrRAR,but lakes don't typically freeze solid either
28-07-2018T18:39:02,MviluUatusun,"That's true of lakes, also Totally."
28-07-2018T18:39:05,qwe304,@unsteddyphoenix evaporation bruh
28-07-2018T18:39:06,ThingsAreMoving,Saltsnow means you need to restart the earth
28-07-2018T18:39:12,Z3ppl1n,^
28-07-2018T18:39:13,CrRAR,It's the convection between the water layers
28-07-2018T18:39:21,CrRAR,The top layer insulates

28-07-2018T18:39:31,Z3ppl1n,yes
28-07-2018T18:39:32,NeonMitsumi,We need to restart it anyway
28-07-2018T18:39:42,ThingsAreMoving,It's gonna do it on it's own
28-07-2018T18:39:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I look away for a sec and you all are science talking

28-07-2018T18:43:11,Ordithus,Need a stronger magnetic field to keep the atmosphere protected from solar winds
28-07-2018T18:43:14,ThingsAreMoving,there's mostly co2 in mars's icecaps
28-07-2018T18:43:22,ThingsAreMoving,also what Ord said

28-07-2018T20:30:12,QuinnAuer,"But no, Clovis needs to be kissed by someone that loves her"
28-07-2018T20:30:14,TomatoBasket,Took a class on it. Shipping is a long and prestegious tradition.
28-07-2018T20:30:19,CrRAR,-3- :dollar:
28-07-2018T20:30:24,TomatoBasket,"Without it, the world would be divided in ways we can hardly imagine."

28-07-2018T20:31:57,TomatoBasket,"Oh, my... those stocking are getting... wow."
28-07-2018T20:32:09,totallynotTrace,unless clovis can find a person made of money

28-07-2018T20:32:55,TomatoBasket,like a fox.
28-07-2018T20:32:55,TheDixieNutjob,YES! Pink maid outfit!
28-07-2018T20:33:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,PINK!!!! \o/
28-07-2018T20:33:01,QuinnAuer,I am very ok with a pink version
28-07-2018T20:33:13,QuinnAuer,"I still kind of want to see classical black, but Clovis would hate pink more"
28-07-2018T20:33:14,Tharkis,"hehe, had problems with my own OC when I had her drawn as an anthro, because a traditional black and white  maid outfit makes it hard to see what's going on with an anthro char with dark fur and stuff"
28-07-2018T20:33:18,goldgardian,"Nah, the black's a classic"
28-07-2018T20:33:19,Ordithus,"The black brings out the reddish hue of Clovis's socks, but so dark"
28-07-2018T20:33:22,Tharkis,ended up going with purple for maid outfit
28-07-2018T20:33:26,Ordithus,White makes the socks look black...
28-07-2018T20:33:26,TomatoBasket,"Why not multiple colors? One classic black, another pink, another blue, and one color for every rainbow. :D"
28-07-2018T20:33:27,Bgrmystr2,blue is also a classic
28-07-2018T20:33:33,Tharkis,yeah exactly Ord
28-07-2018T20:33:41,ZRO4825,Black maid outfits are overdone anyway. Fuchsia is obviously the new thing. :P
28-07-2018T20:33:50,Tharkis,B&W outfit is hard to do with anthros hehe
28-07-2018T20:33:57,Tharkis,or anthros with dark fur anywhere that is
28-07-2018T20:33:58,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno about ""overdone"""
28-07-2018T20:34:00,TomatoBasket,Howabout clear plastic?
28-07-2018T20:34:03,Bgrmystr2,just ppl who don't understand it :V
28-07-2018T20:34:20,TomatoBasket,or... SPARKLES!
28-07-2018T20:34:35,ZRO4825,I understand that blue maid outfits mean I'm getting stabbed.
28-07-2018T20:34:43,ShadowSoap,"You're getting very creative, Tomato XD"
28-07-2018T20:34:51,Ordithus,The bright pink background also makes the socks look darker...
28-07-2018T20:35:00,TomatoBasket,I am always creative. I am a :tomato: after all.
28-07-2018T20:35:20,TomatoBasket,is tom talking? I can't hear over the music.
28-07-2018T20:35:35,Bgrmystr2,"whaat, zro no"
28-07-2018T20:35:36,Bgrmystr2,why
28-07-2018T20:35:38,TomatoBasket,"then again, I can't hear the music."

28-07-2018T20:36:02,TheDixieNutjob,right as I unmuted the stream
28-07-2018T20:36:24,Zakuru,5 drawings in 3ish hours
28-07-2018T20:36:26,CrRAR,lol @ cinderella color for a sec
28-07-2018T20:36:29,TomatoBasket,white stockings are hard to get right without black shoes to go with.
28-07-2018T20:36:42,Ordithus,haha Clovis seems to be a pain to compliment
28-07-2018T20:36:50,TomatoBasket,I think that is what Tom is stuggling with.
28-07-2018T20:36:50,CrRAR,Flat black is a lotta contrast
28-07-2018T20:37:26,Ordithus,"Clovis's evil knows no bounds, even breaking into reality"
28-07-2018T20:37:55,MrEase,"maybe go with Clovis' patented red with gold highlights, (Crimson coloured maid outfit yellow frills?)"
28-07-2018T20:38:08,QuinnAuer,^
28-07-2018T20:38:11,goldgardian,"Ah, crimson and gold?"
28-07-2018T20:38:12,CrRAR,maybe the underside of the dress could be slightly different?
28-07-2018T20:38:14,QuinnAuer,That's a really good idea Ease
28-07-2018T20:38:32,CrRAR,oooo blush pink lol

28-07-2018T20:41:30,TomatoBasket,Oh.... Now I know what Tom was struggling with. the highlighting of the stockings.
28-07-2018T20:41:38,TomatoBasket,it would be hard if it wer flat black.
28-07-2018T20:41:48,TomatoBasket,Wait...

28-07-2018T21:41:44,Twokinds,It barely made it into the top 10.
28-07-2018T21:42:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,some folk just don't understand the good things in life
28-07-2018T21:42:21,TorqueEmUp,"Hmmm, now that you mention it, yeah, that is a bit of a surprise."
28-07-2018T21:42:31,TorqueEmUp,I personally voted Poolside Reni
