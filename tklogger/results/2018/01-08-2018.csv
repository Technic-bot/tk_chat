01-08-2018T12:50:18,TheGamePlayer,Does anyone else just look at something and instantly be able to draw it almost exactly?
01-08-2018T12:52:36,TheGamePlayer,And don't even use guidelines to assist in drawing I just dive right in.

01-08-2018T18:00:36,TheGamePlayer,I did do a paw or whatever but it wasn't matching up with her so I kinda gave up
01-08-2018T18:04:43,TheGamePlayer,I gave up cause I didn't want to start from the shoulder instead I started from the paw/hand thingy
01-08-2018T18:05:57,MrEase,Its definitely a good start
01-08-2018T18:06:24,TheGamePlayer,Thx
01-08-2018T18:07:02,TheGamePlayer,I think its a paper version of the Halloween Flora with the cauldron

01-08-2018T20:13:08,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs sort of a nm thing now. At least most likely. Thanks for thinking of it for me though
01-08-2018T20:13:26,SpazztasticKiwi,It does remind me to check something
01-08-2018T20:13:52,TheGamePlayer,Np I'm here to be kind

01-08-2018T21:55:43,Ordithus,Bees are cute up close.  Spiders are cool/scary up close.
01-08-2018T22:07:24,SpazztasticKiwi,We got a lil garden spider buddy. Don‚Äôt do much
01-08-2018T22:08:09,SpazztasticKiwi,She‚Äôs big enough to catch full grown red wasps. She is my friend
01-08-2018T22:24:08,totallynotTrace,Theres a bunch of spiders around the outside of my house. ive been bit a few times. theyre NOT my friends
01-08-2018T22:24:48,totallynotTrace,they tend to acumulate around doors
01-08-2018T22:24:57,totallynotTrace,then fall on you
01-08-2018T22:25:19,totallynotTrace,then bite
01-08-2018T22:25:26,totallynotTrace,then they get killed
01-08-2018T22:28:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Most spiders aren‚Äôt bitey
01-08-2018T22:29:03,Ordithus,The spiders at your house are just plain rude
01-08-2018T22:29:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm ok unless they decide to just invite themselves right next to me or on me
01-08-2018T22:31:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, my grandma has a mama skink living in a flower pot"
01-08-2018T22:38:08,totallynotTrace,"yah the longlegs arnt bad although theres a bunch, its the brown juicy ones with short legs that bite"
01-08-2018T22:38:49,totallynotTrace,skunks.... uehhh

01-08-2018T22:44:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"The males have a bright blue tail that they detach when attacked. It continues to move, feeding or at least distracting the attacker while it runs"
01-08-2018T22:45:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Females have detachable tails too (and they grow back after awhile). They‚Äôre just not colorful
01-08-2018T22:45:08,totallynotTrace,oh lizards arnt too bad. as long as theyre not aggressive
01-08-2018T22:46:27,SpazztasticKiwi,They‚Äôll bite
01-08-2018T22:46:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve been bit. They can‚Äôt break skin
01-08-2018T22:46:52,totallynotTrace,oh
01-08-2018T22:47:38,totallynotTrace,"at first i was like ""well thats not good at all"" to ""oh cute lil nommer"""
01-08-2018T22:47:39,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs just this lil killer nomming on your hand till it decides to grant mercy and release
01-08-2018T22:48:28,totallynotTrace,assuming they dont have any teeth?
01-08-2018T22:49:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Tiny teeth. It‚Äôs why you should never rip them off
01-08-2018T22:49:08,totallynotTrace,ah
01-08-2018T22:49:17,SpazztasticKiwi,It can break the teeth or even the wee jaw
01-08-2018T22:49:27,totallynotTrace,i live in New england so we dont have those
01-08-2018T22:49:34,totallynotTrace,Oh
01-08-2018T22:49:38,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-LauraCry: no hurt the lizard
01-08-2018T22:49:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Tiny cute lizard friend. Eats bugs
01-08-2018T22:50:00,totallynotTrace,that sucks for the lizard.  I thought you would say it would tear skin
01-08-2018T22:50:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I taped two Anole lizards (separate species - actual lizards as opposed to a skink)
01-08-2018T22:50:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Two males having a territorial/dominance dispute
01-08-2018T22:51:49,SpazztasticKiwi,It starts with them fanning a red frill they have on the necks (varying shades/darkness of red) and bobbing their heads at each other
01-08-2018T22:53:30,Dadrobit,"Pardon me, just dropping in to post the cutest of snakes http://i.imgur.com/JikOZAn.jpg"

01-08-2018T22:55:16,Dadrobit,Sand Boa
01-08-2018T22:55:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Skinks are pretty spread out. Blue tails live generally in warm areas

01-08-2018T22:56:27,totallynotTrace,nope havent seen the video
01-08-2018T22:57:35,Dadrobit,"Nah, not too terribly into snake stuff. My brother is, and I just catch some of it. Dude has a reptile room for all the crazy stuff he has."
01-08-2018T22:58:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I want a hognose. They don‚Äôt get huge and they got the most boopable snoots
01-08-2018T22:58:25,Ordithus,There aren't many reptiles where I live.  The winter is harsh.
01-08-2018T22:58:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Let me see if I can get that video
01-08-2018T22:58:40,Dadrobit,About half of his snakes I'm cool with. Some of the others are just too aggressive for my liking.
01-08-2018T22:59:16,Dadrobit,And only two of his reptiles. The others are medium dog sized and honestly scare the shit out of me.
01-08-2018T22:59:41,totallynotTrace,yeah I wouldnt trust those either
01-08-2018T23:00:35,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/QRwA7Mz.jpg His biggest boa is probably tied for my favorite with his smallest https://i.imgur.com/QRwA7Mz.jpg

01-08-2018T23:10:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Shame
01-08-2018T23:10:27,Dadrobit,Agreed/
01-08-2018T23:10:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Could‚Äôve braided it and donated it to Locks o Love
