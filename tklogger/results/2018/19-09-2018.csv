19-09-2018T06:14:49,unsteddyphoenix,he did. its broken
19-09-2018T06:15:13,Bgrmystr2,"he did, I witnessed it. I don't think he broke the chat, however, but someone did say that and it was not me."
19-09-2018T06:15:36,ThingsAreMoving,I merely unleashed some potential for fun
19-09-2018T06:16:36,ThingsAreMoving,btw Bgr that's a great memory you have over there
19-09-2018T06:16:52,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, sometimes yes"
19-09-2018T06:16:57,Bgrmystr2,sometimes no. xD

19-09-2018T06:17:33,Bgrmystr2,"not good with faces, names, or what I ate yesterday."
19-09-2018T06:17:43,Bgrmystr2,"win some, lose some."
19-09-2018T06:17:54,ThingsAreMoving,I have no memory for dates

19-09-2018T06:26:30,Bgrmystr2,I had remoted friend's computer one time when I was helpin him troubleshoot a program install or whatever
19-09-2018T06:26:32,ThingsAreMoving,I wonder if there are more functionalities to the chat
19-09-2018T06:26:52,ThingsAreMoving,I couldn't find the command for the text bubble anywhere
19-09-2018T06:27:00,Bgrmystr2,and while he was gone I was sending silly messages to friends we both knew
19-09-2018T06:27:12,Bgrmystr2,just waiting for him to return
19-09-2018T06:27:25,Bgrmystr2,and he didn't notice till after it was the next day
19-09-2018T06:27:37,ThingsAreMoving,In skinny culture it's considered a dick move

19-09-2018T06:28:45,Bgrmystr2,cuz I wouldn't do it if it wasn't a mutual friend or whatnot
19-09-2018T06:29:45,Bgrmystr2,hmmmmmmm it's 6:30 I should sleep

19-09-2018T17:32:30,CrRAR,Well a day or whatever ago they announced further discussions would happen in the news.

19-09-2018T17:34:35,ThingsAreMoving,there's a three day summit and they're talking about dismantling north Korea's nuclear potential
19-09-2018T17:35:15,CrRAR,yeah
19-09-2018T17:35:17,CrRAR,Mr. Kim said he and Mr. Moon had “made a firm commitment to exert active efforts to make the Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons and nuclear threat and turn it into a land of peace.”
19-09-2018T17:36:07,Bgrmystr2,they've been doin talks like that for a while though
19-09-2018T17:36:11,ThingsAreMoving,^
19-09-2018T17:36:26,CrRAR,Very true

19-09-2018T17:36:33,CrRAR,Just another milestone I guess.
19-09-2018T17:36:35,Bgrmystr2,"till then, it's just talk, but no actiopn"
19-09-2018T17:36:42,Bgrmystr2,action* asilfhgka
19-09-2018T17:37:26,CrRAR,"Still at least it's positive news, Germany, when the wall came down was super happy times."
19-09-2018T17:38:11,CrRAR,like folks happy-crying in the streets type stuff.
19-09-2018T17:41:43,ThingsAreMoving,"...how old are you, exactly?"
19-09-2018T17:47:36,CrRAR,Not old enough to see it happen but old enough to know it was a thing.
19-09-2018T17:47:42,CrRAR,I was just a wee baby.

19-09-2018T18:03:41,ThingsAreMoving,after extensive googling I can tell you with 100% certainty that... I don't know.
19-09-2018T18:04:14,CrimsonQuill,"It's rather strong, mind. I recommend trying just a small amount, with a cracker, and seeing how it goes."
19-09-2018T18:04:22,ThingsAreMoving,looks like it would be nice on quattro formaggi pizza or in a fondue
19-09-2018T18:04:51,CrimsonQuill,It's more a cheese to have on it's own or with crackers and/or a chutney or pickle.
