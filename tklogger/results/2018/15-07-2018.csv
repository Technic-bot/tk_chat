15-07-2018T00:02:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I go through fits of watching YouTube creators
15-07-2018T00:03:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Tonight seems to be CinemaSins. Nitpicking has never been so funny
15-07-2018T00:40:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Roaring headache. Bed time
15-07-2018T00:51:12,DarthRexKing,Goodnight.
15-07-2018T00:51:29,DarthRexKing,I am going too. See ya.
15-07-2018T09:21:51,Dadrobit,"I swear, I do not understand how LEague players can be so damned toxic."
15-07-2018T09:21:54,Dadrobit,LEague*
15-07-2018T09:21:58,Dadrobit,Fuck it
15-07-2018T09:23:56,Dadrobit,"Snowbaled a game off of a double kill counter gank top lane, went 18-2-3, and the damn top laner complains that he's going to report me for being a kill stealin whore because he totally could have taken the 2v1 alone."
15-07-2018T09:24:14,Dadrobit,end rant
15-07-2018T09:24:24,Dadrobit,Snowballed*
15-07-2018T09:24:35,Dadrobit,stealing*
15-07-2018T09:24:58,Dadrobit,Never been so tilted form a win before that I can't spell properly anymore.
15-07-2018T09:25:07,Dadrobit,from*
15-07-2018T09:45:58,SiliconCarbide,"ive given up on league years ago, precisely because of that, for me the few moments of fun are just outweighed by all the flaming and bitching"
15-07-2018T09:57:39,NightMeaty22,Good morning 😩
15-07-2018T10:02:16,MarshallMelon,"When a game's community is toxic enough that it drives Dunkey of all people to quit it cold turkey, you know you've got a real winner on your hands"
15-07-2018T10:16:24,Twokinds,Morning!
15-07-2018T10:16:54,iliar,Good morning!
15-07-2018T10:18:05,SiliconCarbide,mornin
15-07-2018T10:19:29,NightMeaty22,How are you all doing
15-07-2018T10:20:08,iliar,"Tom, I want clarify one thing about my suggestion. Why did you not start painting royal dragon family? It's forbidden topic? Or I can suggest it at next time?"
15-07-2018T10:20:53,Twokinds,My biggest issue is that designing a dragon is a lot of effort.
15-07-2018T10:21:04,Twokinds,It's not something easy to do on the spot during a stream.
15-07-2018T10:21:23,Twokinds,I would have to invent a dragon and a princess.
15-07-2018T10:23:56,iliar,"My first suggestion was ""Historical moment. Reni's grandfather and human princess watching how first dragon princess hatching from an egg."" but then I thought 3 new characters will be too much."
15-07-2018T10:27:04,Twokinds,I do like the suggestion
15-07-2018T10:27:10,Twokinds,But I'll need more preperation
15-07-2018T10:27:17,Twokinds,Perhaps next week when I'm not streaming sketches
15-07-2018T10:28:45,iliar,And I'm not sure how exactly she was born. I mean dragons should be hatching from an egg. But her mother are human. Humans not lay eggs.
15-07-2018T10:29:46,iliar,No stream at next week? Because of CCSD?
15-07-2018T10:30:55,Twokinds,Yes
15-07-2018T10:31:05,BadFoMo,I like to think that Grandpa took Grandma and Tf-ed her into a Dragon.
15-07-2018T10:31:56,iliar,I think so too
15-07-2018T10:32:08,BadFoMo,...Or the other way around (like Euchre). That works too.
15-07-2018T10:32:15,iliar,Maybe only for a while.
15-07-2018T10:35:55,iliar,If a dragon turns into a human and get a child from a human I think born a human.
15-07-2018T10:36:50,iliar,And If a dragon turns human into a dragon  and get a child from this dragon  I think born a dragon.
15-07-2018T10:37:23,iliar,I think it will be logical.
15-07-2018T10:43:33,Dadrobit,"To be fair, Dunkey got banned for being rather over the top toxic."
15-07-2018T10:44:19,BadFoMo,"That gives me a bad idea. If it goes 'Grandma became a Dragon', the child could have courted a Keidran or a Basitin, turned them into a Dragon and made Reni."
15-07-2018T10:44:34,Dadrobit,"Like, complaining and calling names is one thing, but the dude straihgt up told someone that they needed to be gunned down in the streets."
15-07-2018T10:44:40,Dadrobit,straight*
15-07-2018T10:47:48,SiliconCarbide,he also defended that trash talk
15-07-2018T10:48:07,SiliconCarbide,didnt he say the toxicity is what made league fun?
15-07-2018T10:49:11,Dadrobit,"Something along the lines of ""toxicity is the only fun part of the game because the players are bad"""
15-07-2018T10:50:02,SiliconCarbide,lovely :D
15-07-2018T10:53:06,SiliconCarbide,ill never get used to the emotes here
15-07-2018T10:53:11,SiliconCarbide,"Bouncing idead rn, Tom would you draw the skyline of a modern city or is that too complex for streams?"
15-07-2018T10:54:30,Twokinds,They'd be silhouettes
15-07-2018T10:54:48,SiliconCarbide,mh so nighttime would be easier?
15-07-2018T11:00:02,Twokinds,"Hm, doesn't matter"
15-07-2018T11:00:09,SiliconCarbide,alright
15-07-2018T11:20:32,Dadrobit,"Huh, got a letter from the Dept. of Labor."
15-07-2018T11:20:52,TorqueEmUp,Well at least it ain't from the IRS
15-07-2018T11:21:44,Dadrobit,They did an investigation into my last employer and found that I was owed some back wages.
15-07-2018T11:21:55,TorqueEmUp,nice
15-07-2018T11:22:18,Dadrobit,A whopping $13.47 after they deducted taxes and Social Security.
15-07-2018T11:23:19,Dadrobit,Have to do some paperwork to collect it though.
15-07-2018T11:25:25,Dadrobit,"Somewhere between my 2014-2017 employment, the missed an hour. Scary how thorough the govt. can be when they want."
15-07-2018T11:27:19,TorqueEmUp,wow
15-07-2018T11:29:37,SiliconCarbide,"a few months back i was applying for a us visa, sent in a photo of mine that was 8 months old"
15-07-2018T11:29:41,Twokinds,wow
15-07-2018T11:30:04,SiliconCarbide,"within 2 weeks i get an email that i need to send in an up to date photo of mine, because the one i sent in is over 6 months old"
15-07-2018T11:30:18,SiliconCarbide,how could they know?!
15-07-2018T11:30:40,Twokinds,:O
15-07-2018T11:30:48,Twokinds,metadata?
15-07-2018T11:32:00,MarshallMelon,"Yeah, most digital files have a lot of data tucked away that can be seen with special programs. I'd imagine the US government takes that stuff pretty seriously."
15-07-2018T11:32:20,MarshallMelon,Immigration doubly so
15-07-2018T11:33:32,SiliconCarbide,"no meta data, it was a scan of a photograph"
15-07-2018T11:33:47,SiliconCarbide,"because i did not get a digital copy, because they wanted to charge 50€ for that"
15-07-2018T11:34:17,SiliconCarbide,"was just a temporary visa, work related, still official though"
15-07-2018T11:34:56,MarshallMelon,Did you use the same picture for anything else?
15-07-2018T11:35:05,SiliconCarbide,yeah its on my passport^^
15-07-2018T11:35:11,MarshallMelon,For how long?
15-07-2018T11:35:15,SiliconCarbide,and that one is less than 6 months old
15-07-2018T11:35:26,SiliconCarbide,because i ordered it specifically for this journey
15-07-2018T11:35:34,MarshallMelon,But if your passport photo was a digital file then it would contain the metadata too
15-07-2018T11:35:52,SiliconCarbide,na i only had to turn in a physical copy
15-07-2018T11:35:56,SiliconCarbide,when i got mine
15-07-2018T11:59:54,Twokinds,"I just got my passport recently, after having it go missing about a decade ago."
15-07-2018T13:08:36,Xexanoth,"well, nice to have it back i guess?"
15-07-2018T13:09:02,Twokinds,Ys
15-07-2018T13:09:38,Xexanoth,so what happened to it?
15-07-2018T13:11:38,Twokinds,I don't remember.
15-07-2018T13:11:46,Twokinds,I think I lost it on the plane during a return flight.
15-07-2018T13:11:54,Twokinds,Just left it in the seat pocket.
15-07-2018T13:13:47,SiliconCarbide,its good as new! the foto no longer matches me and it has some weird stamps from mexican and columbian border stations
15-07-2018T13:13:54,SiliconCarbide,but apart from that... its basically new
15-07-2018T13:13:58,SiliconCarbide,dont your passports expire?
15-07-2018T13:14:44,Twokinds,Yeah in 10 years
15-07-2018T13:14:50,Twokinds,My new one will expire in 2028
15-07-2018T13:14:58,Xexanoth,so someone finally cleaned the plane and found the passport?
15-07-2018T13:15:05,SiliconCarbide,ah so its a new one!
15-07-2018T13:15:06,Twokinds,No I just finally got a new one.
15-07-2018T13:15:09,SiliconCarbide,haha
15-07-2018T13:15:10,SiliconCarbide,ok
15-07-2018T13:15:11,Xexanoth,oohhh
15-07-2018T13:15:13,SiliconCarbide,yeah that makes sense
15-07-2018T13:15:18,Twokinds,"I have no idea what happened to the old one, but I never went overseas again, so..."
15-07-2018T13:15:25,Twokinds,Eh it didn't really matter
15-07-2018T13:15:32,Twokinds,But I'm going to Korea this year. So I needed a new one.
15-07-2018T13:15:44,SiliconCarbide,southern one i hope
15-07-2018T13:16:16,SiliconCarbide,whats the occasion?
15-07-2018T13:16:26,Xexanoth,"nah, he's gonna draw the furry version of Kim Jong Un!"
15-07-2018T13:16:26,Twokinds,West Korea
15-07-2018T13:16:49,Twokinds,Visiting family
15-07-2018T13:17:14,SiliconCarbide,nice
15-07-2018T13:24:48,Twokinds,"I wish passports were slightly smaller, so I could fit it in my wallet."
15-07-2018T13:27:03,SiliconCarbide,"had the same problem, cargo pants helped :P"
15-07-2018T13:31:23,Xexanoth,"just cut it down, i'm sure no one will mind XD"
15-07-2018T13:35:40,SiliconCarbide,photo identification should suffice right?
15-07-2018T13:35:54,SiliconCarbide,rests just dead weight
15-07-2018T15:50:27,TorqueEmUp,*woof woof

15-07-2018T18:19:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Isn’t the new thing that star program on your license
15-07-2018T18:20:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Though that may be domestic only. I have no plans to go anywhere so I haven’t looked at it too hard
15-07-2018T18:58:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also Tom, I for got to mention - though it’s not a critical detail - Justice is the 11th card of the Major Arcana. It’s usually shown as Roman numerals in a corner of the card."
15-07-2018T19:04:14,Twokinds,"I thought about adding it, but I kept finding cards that had different numbers on them"
15-07-2018T19:04:27,Twokinds,So I didn't want to risk using the wrong one.
15-07-2018T19:11:02,Twokinds,I'm going to be running a brief stream test.
15-07-2018T19:11:27,Bgrmystr2,:o

15-07-2018T19:23:24,Bgrmystr2,"it's a bit jumpy, but that might be the picarto servers"
15-07-2018T19:23:28,Afallingtree,About 20 fps
15-07-2018T19:25:10,Bespin,"ah, shading"
15-07-2018T19:25:57,BadFoMo,It's a little jumpy for me too.
15-07-2018T19:26:46,BadFoMo,"Ah, crap. I broke it."
15-07-2018T19:26:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,just drop'd down to like 3 fps for a sec there
15-07-2018T19:27:10,LannAF,Or it could be that he's testing as it says
15-07-2018T19:27:23,MuonNeutrino,"NO! we will not ignore you, flora! &gt;=["
15-07-2018T19:27:27,MuonNeutrino,^_^
15-07-2018T19:27:29,Afallingtree,I thought i was the only one getting an unstable connection cause I’m in nz
15-07-2018T19:28:43,BadFoMo,"Also, I'm getting a 20-ish second delay in the chats."
15-07-2018T19:29:30,MuonNeutrino,"yeah, it doesn't seem to be as snappy as usual"
15-07-2018T19:29:36,Bgrmystr2,"the delay in the chat will be from his upload to picarto, and then the download from picarto to you, Fomo"
15-07-2018T19:29:45,MuonNeutrino,yeah but it's usually shorter than that
15-07-2018T19:29:51,Bgrmystr2,not for everyone

15-07-2018T19:31:04,Afallingtree,Remind me again why we aren’t using a bigger streaming website like twitch?
15-07-2018T19:31:16,Twokinds,That's because I'm streaming over wifi from a mobile device
15-07-2018T19:31:21,Bespin,Ahh i see
15-07-2018T19:31:25,Twokinds,That's what the stream test is.

15-07-2018T19:32:46,Twokinds,Twitch no has multistream
15-07-2018T19:32:48,LannAF,Placing both in the same place would cause convolution in terms of trying to find a specific stream
15-07-2018T19:32:48,Zaggatar,"picarto is fun to use, quite straightforward if you ask me, LannAF"
15-07-2018T19:32:49,LannAF,Also that.
15-07-2018T19:32:52,MuonNeutrino,also twitch's TOS would probably prohibit art like tom's which could be interpreted as NSFW by some people
15-07-2018T19:32:58,LannAF,"Yeah, Picarto is good for art for sure."
15-07-2018T19:33:05,qwe304,"""currently playing:"" is broken too"
15-07-2018T19:33:18,Bgrmystr2,currently playing isn't even up
15-07-2018T19:33:18,LannAF,The multi-stream feature of Picarto is very nifty too.
15-07-2018T19:33:28,totallynotTrace,well patreon certainly thought it was nsfw XD
15-07-2018T19:33:31,NeonMitsumi,reheehee
15-07-2018T19:33:40,MuonNeutrino,"twitch *does* have a category for art/creative stuff now, but i doubt tom could get away with drawing his stuff on there"
15-07-2018T19:33:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
15-07-2018T19:33:44,Afallingtree,Lel
15-07-2018T19:33:56,MuonNeutrino,"nude keidran may not have anything showing, but twitch would probably still consider that nsfw XD"
15-07-2018T19:33:58,Zaggatar,why would it do that Muon?
15-07-2018T19:34:07,LannAF,"Correct, and the features of Picarto are still specifically directed towards art."
15-07-2018T19:34:07,Zaggatar,twitch interpeting it
15-07-2018T19:34:11,MuonNeutrino,twitch is much more conservative on nsfw content
15-07-2018T19:34:14,NeonMitsumi,People get banned for less on twitch.
15-07-2018T19:34:18,LannAF,They used to be more lenient.
15-07-2018T19:34:19,NeonMitsumi,owo
15-07-2018T19:34:27,Zaggatar,"but he doesnt draw NSFW, from what I know"
15-07-2018T19:34:29,Corinthian,Hello
15-07-2018T19:34:31,LannAF,But then tit streamers and NSFW streams kinda became rampant for a while iirc
15-07-2018T19:34:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,also twitch has the ocean man chat spam
15-07-2018T19:34:42,Bespin,wut is dis
15-07-2018T19:34:44,MuonNeutrino,@Zaggatar the point is that twitch's definition of NSFW isnt the same as ours/picarto's
15-07-2018T19:34:45,Bespin,!!!!!!!!!!
15-07-2018T19:34:47,totallynotTrace,zagg they are borderline nsfw
15-07-2018T19:34:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,story boarding?
15-07-2018T19:34:51,NeonMitsumi,Sidecomic? Next chapter?
15-07-2018T19:34:51,MuonNeutrino,@Zaggatar twitch *would* consider it nsfw
15-07-2018T19:34:52,Zaggatar,as I said I am new so sorry if I dont know
15-07-2018T19:34:53,Zaggatar,aaah
15-07-2018T19:35:35,Twokinds,This is probably not a good stream to be new in as this is not a stream
15-07-2018T19:35:40,Afallingtree,Besides I kinda like a quieter stream website because those stream trolls are all over twitch
15-07-2018T19:35:42,Zaggatar,hah
15-07-2018T19:35:46,MuonNeutrino,heh
15-07-2018T19:35:46,Bespin,us lucky folk
15-07-2018T19:35:48,Bgrmystr2,xD
15-07-2018T19:35:48,Bespin,get to see
15-07-2018T19:35:48,Twokinds,I am just running some tests to see how it handles streaming
15-07-2018T19:35:50,ZahnHolley,Howdy
15-07-2018T19:35:52,Zaggatar,"it is ok, I enjoy other ppls art"
15-07-2018T19:35:57,MuonNeutrino,"yes, this entire thing is a figment of our collective imagination. there's no strream here &gt;.&gt;"
15-07-2018T19:35:57,qwe304,new device?
15-07-2018T19:35:58,Zaggatar,test or no test
15-07-2018T19:36:05,Bgrmystr2,"you should come back when there is a proper stream, Zagg"
15-07-2018T19:36:09,Bgrmystr2,good stuff
15-07-2018T19:36:23,MuonNeutrino,we are all just having an elaborate hallucination
15-07-2018T19:36:23,totallynotTrace,"""this stream is not a stream""."
15-07-2018T19:36:34,qwe304,"@Zaggatar you can click on the ""videos"" button and see a real stream"
15-07-2018T19:36:37,Bespin,cuute
15-07-2018T19:36:40,Zaggatar,noice
15-07-2018T19:36:44,Zaggatar,thanks
15-07-2018T19:36:47,MuonNeutrino,"like, that image there, that would be a good example. twitch would consider that nsfw, because omg naked people"
15-07-2018T19:36:50,Corinthian,A lot of improvement
15-07-2018T19:36:57,Bgrmystr2,Indeed Muon
15-07-2018T19:36:58,KiTA,oh wow
15-07-2018T19:37:03,LannAF,Is your internet not working Tom? Or just testing it out for the sake of knowing just in case.
15-07-2018T19:37:11,Bgrmystr2,"It's a test, Lann"
15-07-2018T19:37:22,qwe304,did you finish the adira/maeve one?
15-07-2018T19:37:23,Bgrmystr2,using a mobile connection
15-07-2018T19:37:25,Zaggatar,"ah ok, so if no underwear even if no ""genitals"" or so, it is seen as NSFW"
15-07-2018T19:37:30,Zaggatar,on twitch
15-07-2018T19:37:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Hey Tom quick side question, Any news on when keenspot will ship out book 4?"
15-07-2018T19:37:44,Zaggatar,good thing I dont use twitch myself then hah
15-07-2018T19:37:49,Bgrmystr2,"Zagg, there's a LOT of stuff twitch consider against their ToS"
15-07-2018T19:37:49,qwe304,lol thats like the 10th time ivew seen that asked
15-07-2018T19:37:50,MuonNeutrino,"@Zaggatar i doubt there's such hard and fast rules, but along those lines, more or less"
15-07-2018T19:37:51,Pwatcher67,hello all
15-07-2018T19:37:56,KiTA,Is this picture available anywhere heh
15-07-2018T19:38:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,qwe do you know? 0_0
15-07-2018T19:38:09,KiTA,first I've seen the improvement meme by Tom XD
15-07-2018T19:38:12,Twokinds,Okay I'm going now
15-07-2018T19:38:14,MuonNeutrino,"in general, twitch doesn't like anything that gets more than even mildly suggestive"
15-07-2018T19:38:20,Zaggatar,"I am glad picarto allows NSFW, its... fun"
15-07-2018T19:38:23,Twokinds,Goodbye!
15-07-2018T19:38:23,TheFDdriver,hello
15-07-2018T19:38:25,MuonNeutrino,night!
15-07-2018T19:38:26,Bgrmystr2,alright tom :u
15-07-2018T19:38:28,NeonMitsumi,Byeeeeee~
15-07-2018T19:38:29,Afallingtree,Cya
15-07-2018T19:38:29,ZahnHolley,Later tom
15-07-2018T19:38:31,totallynotTrace,k good not a stream tom
15-07-2018T19:38:33,Bespin,bye Tom
15-07-2018T19:38:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"See ya Tom, have fun at comicon"
15-07-2018T19:38:33,TheFDdriver,Bye Tom
15-07-2018T19:38:36,Corinthian,See ya tom
15-07-2018T19:38:40,MuonNeutrino,hi bye~!
15-07-2018T19:38:45,LannAF,Obviously Bgr.
15-07-2018T19:38:45,Twokinds,Could you guys hear the music?
15-07-2018T19:38:47,Bgrmystr2,yes
15-07-2018T19:38:47,MuonNeutrino,yes
15-07-2018T19:38:48,Bespin,nop
15-07-2018T19:38:50,Corinthian,Yeah
15-07-2018T19:38:50,TheFDdriver,yes
15-07-2018T19:38:50,qwe304,are you gonna post the sketches from AC?
15-07-2018T19:38:51,totallynotTrace,yup
15-07-2018T19:38:53,Bgrmystr2,"bespin, you're prolly muted"
15-07-2018T19:38:53,Afallingtree,Yep
15-07-2018T19:38:55,NeonMitsumi,Still can.
15-07-2018T19:39:16,Twokinds,I can't display music because that requires Chrome to be open and it can't handle Chrome at the same time as photoshop and firefox...
15-07-2018T19:39:20,NeonMitsumi,"@qwe304 He said that he didn't take pictures of most of them, yesterday."
15-07-2018T19:39:35,MuonNeutrino,"the recipients might post em, but yeah"
15-07-2018T19:39:36,Zaggatar,why not only use chrome?
15-07-2018T19:39:44,Zaggatar,why is firefox needed?
15-07-2018T19:39:50,Twokinds,Firefox displays chat
15-07-2018T19:40:10,Zaggatar,oh
15-07-2018T19:40:12,Twokinds,"I can't remember why I don't use Chrome for chat, but there was some issue with it"
15-07-2018T19:40:26,Zaggatar,it is not the picarto chat-window you talk about?
15-07-2018T19:40:34,Bgrmystr2,yeah the chat window
15-07-2018T19:40:43,Zaggatar,"hm weird, it works for me on chrome"
15-07-2018T19:40:51,qwe304,are you streaming from a laptop?
15-07-2018T19:40:54,Bgrmystr2,"just FYI tom, OBS has a ""Browser source"" so you don't need to use a browser"
15-07-2018T19:41:05,Bgrmystr2,it has a built-in browser you can use to show chat
15-07-2018T19:41:16,Twokinds,But then... how am I supposed to chat back?
15-07-2018T19:41:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,mic?
15-07-2018T19:41:26,Bgrmystr2,you can log into the browser source
15-07-2018T19:41:28,qwe304,how often do you chat back tho...
15-07-2018T19:41:30,Bgrmystr2,and chat via that
15-07-2018T19:41:33,Bgrmystr2,it allows you to do it
15-07-2018T19:41:34,Twokinds,Well I am right now
15-07-2018T19:41:37,NeonMitsumi,:V
15-07-2018T19:41:40,qwe304,true...
15-07-2018T19:41:43,Zaggatar,"popout chat window got chat for me, might it be soem setting?"
15-07-2018T19:41:57,Zaggatar,liek chat back I mean
15-07-2018T19:42:11,qwe304,could have it open on a phone or somthing to chat in
15-07-2018T19:42:11,Bgrmystr2,as soon as my OBS opens &gt;:t
15-07-2018T19:42:23,ferociousfox,"Wait, whats happening"
15-07-2018T19:42:28,qwe304,nothing atm
15-07-2018T19:42:32,Twokinds,nothing
15-07-2018T19:42:45,Zaggatar,you maybe could ask the picarto admins for some help?
15-07-2018T19:42:48,Dimensional,Absolutely nothing. Which is what you are about to become. XD
15-07-2018T19:42:56,Zaggatar,they're friendly and helped me on an occasion and two
15-07-2018T19:43:01,Dimensional,Dark Helmut joke.
15-07-2018T19:43:02,Bgrmystr2,"when you open a browser source in OBS, it gives you dimensions and stuff, and lets you put in a website URL"
15-07-2018T19:43:14,Bgrmystr2,"if you right click it in the OBS window, you can click ""interact"""
15-07-2018T19:43:37,Bgrmystr2,which pulls a window and lets you do stuff with the page like a normal browser
15-07-2018T19:43:51,Pwatcher67,is the stream over?
15-07-2018T19:43:56,Bgrmystr2,yeah it was just a test stream
15-07-2018T19:43:57,qwe304,yup
15-07-2018T19:43:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,was a test stream
15-07-2018T19:44:18,Twokinds,"There was no stream, I was just running a test of some settings."
15-07-2018T19:44:47,MuonNeutrino,"which did technically involve turning the stream on, but he just had random doodles and previous stuff"
15-07-2018T19:45:04,MuonNeutrino,you didn't miss any deep dark secrets ^^
15-07-2018T19:45:15,qwe304,@Pwatcher67 heres what you missed https://imgur.com/a/R6WZ9HK
15-07-2018T19:45:39,MuonNeutrino,"ok, true, there was that mysterious red stuff"
15-07-2018T19:46:04,Twokinds,"Hm, image quality seems okay from those screenshots, considering the bitrate was a lower."
15-07-2018T19:46:18,Bgrmystr2,yeah it was pretty nice quality
15-07-2018T19:46:18,qwe304,imma gues that was next pages (or a side comic maybe) :ptv-wondering:
15-07-2018T19:46:21,MuonNeutrino,"the image quality was alright in general, it was just somewhat choppy"
15-07-2018T19:46:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,stream was pretty sharp
15-07-2018T19:46:24,Bgrmystr2,jumpy though
15-07-2018T19:46:35,Zaggatar,"lower bitrate is faster stream, good tradeoff to avoid choppyness"
15-07-2018T19:46:36,qwe304,@Twokinds I try to get the best caps
15-07-2018T19:46:40,Twokinds,"Well, jumpy can't be helped. There were no dropped frames."
15-07-2018T19:46:46,Twokinds,It's just a less powerful device.
15-07-2018T19:46:56,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, the hardware is gonna be the bottleneck probably"
15-07-2018T19:46:57,Twokinds,"I might try adjusting some settings, see if that helps."
15-07-2018T19:47:02,MuonNeutrino,"yeah if this was a laptop or something tethered through a mobile device, that was pretty darn good"
15-07-2018T19:47:15,qwe304,i think a lower framerate would be fine (as long as you avoid the bounces)
15-07-2018T19:47:16,MuonNeutrino,"it was choppier/etc than usual, but it still would have been completely watchable"
15-07-2018T19:47:19,Bgrmystr2,the browser source might be less intensive than running firefox plus the stream
15-07-2018T19:47:21,Ordithus,Dat Flora is cute
15-07-2018T19:47:43,Bgrmystr2,may need to experiement with it
15-07-2018T19:47:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I noticed when you where drawing floras tail the frames drop'd down to single digits, for me at least"
15-07-2018T19:49:26,Ordithus,The recording is a bit jumpy but not bad
15-07-2018T19:51:21,Combak,"... So, what exactly was getting tested? New streaming set-up?"
15-07-2018T19:51:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,wifi stream and settings
15-07-2018T19:51:35,Bgrmystr2,not raelly new
15-07-2018T19:51:40,Bgrmystr2,really* Dx
15-07-2018T19:51:41,Combak,"Ah, I see."
15-07-2018T19:51:57,qwe304,im guessing tom was testing a mobile streaming setup for use at SDCC
15-07-2018T19:52:00,Combak,So Tom wouldn't require an Ethernet connection?
15-07-2018T19:52:07,Bgrmystr2,"well yeah, qwe"
15-07-2018T19:52:12,Bgrmystr2,xD
15-07-2018T19:52:22,Ordithus,Okay the bouncing was kinda hilaribad
15-07-2018T19:52:22,unsteddyphoenix,ahh fake stream
15-07-2018T19:52:24,Bgrmystr2,it's obv not as good though
15-07-2018T19:52:25,unsteddyphoenix,gotcha
15-07-2018T19:52:35,Bgrmystr2,yeah ord xD
15-07-2018T19:52:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi UNsteddy
15-07-2018T19:52:39,Bgrmystr2,hey phoenix
15-07-2018T19:52:41,Twokinds,Yeah just seeing if I might be able to do a primative stream at SDCC
15-07-2018T19:52:42,unsteddyphoenix,heyo~
15-07-2018T19:52:50,MuonNeutrino,"it was a bit choppy, but i'd still totally watch it"
15-07-2018T19:52:50,unsteddyphoenix,Oooh that would be cool
15-07-2018T19:52:53,Ordithus,It seems to have worked well enough
15-07-2018T19:52:56,MuonNeutrino,was not unwatchable by any means
15-07-2018T19:52:57,unsteddyphoenix,Like in your hotel room or something?
15-07-2018T19:53:11,Twokinds,Yeah perhaps
15-07-2018T19:53:27,Bgrmystr2,I wonder if the hotel room have ethernet
15-07-2018T19:53:29,qwe304,i wanna see a livestream of the booth :ptv-snicker:
15-07-2018T19:53:33,Bgrmystr2,they should have wifi for the hotel itself
15-07-2018T19:53:42,Bgrmystr2,you shouldn't need to use a phone network for that
15-07-2018T19:53:50,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
15-07-2018T19:53:56,Bgrmystr2,the wireless network would be way faster
15-07-2018T19:54:17,qwe304,"bring an ethernet cable, most hotels have ethernet still"
15-07-2018T19:54:29,Twokinds,Although most hotels I've stayed at in San Diego have ethernet cables
15-07-2018T19:54:39,Twokinds,Though I still am not confident in their connections.
15-07-2018T19:54:45,Twokinds,ESPECIALLY during Comic Con
15-07-2018T19:54:53,ferociousfox,better to be safe then
15-07-2018T19:54:55,Bgrmystr2,you can always try speedtest
15-07-2018T19:55:00,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah that's a good point
15-07-2018T19:55:14,Ordithus,Often times you have to pay extra for a decent connection or a connection at all
15-07-2018T19:55:20,MuonNeutrino,"bring a cable *and* your tethering setup, backup plans ^^"
15-07-2018T19:55:26,Twokinds,"yeah, it's a fancy hotel"
15-07-2018T19:55:31,Twokinds,So no free wifi
15-07-2018T19:55:35,qwe304,i think 8Mb up would be ok for a stream
15-07-2018T19:55:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,eek
15-07-2018T19:55:36,Ordithus,Ironic
15-07-2018T19:55:38,unsteddyphoenix,Thats odd lol
15-07-2018T19:55:38,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, what Muon said. As long as you have both, should be fine"
15-07-2018T19:55:46,Twokinds,The more expensive the hotel the less you get
15-07-2018T19:55:57,Bgrmystr2,really? That's not how it is here
15-07-2018T19:56:01,Bgrmystr2,super strange
15-07-2018T19:56:03,Ordithus,The last hotel that had free wifi I felt dirty
15-07-2018T19:56:18,Ordithus,I opted to tether instead
15-07-2018T19:56:27,ferociousfox,cheap hotels lure you in with free internet
15-07-2018T19:56:28,ZRO4825,Cheaper hotels gotta have something to make it worth putting up with their less than perfect standards. :P
15-07-2018T19:56:28,unsteddyphoenix,But do they leave those little mints on thepillow?
15-07-2018T19:56:30,Ordithus,shudders
15-07-2018T19:56:35,qwe304,i usually use a vpn
15-07-2018T19:56:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I love those mints unsteddy
15-07-2018T19:56:47,Bgrmystr2,"that would make streams basically unwatchable, Qwe"
15-07-2018T19:56:58,Bgrmystr2,I've never seen a mint on a pillow in my life
15-07-2018T19:57:01,Bgrmystr2,the fok
15-07-2018T19:57:05,qwe304,depends on how good your vpn is
15-07-2018T19:57:13,qwe304,mine is pretty good
15-07-2018T19:57:19,Bgrmystr2,a vpn will always be delayed to a certain extent
15-07-2018T19:57:42,qwe304,delay doesnt matter for an art stream
15-07-2018T19:57:47,unsteddyphoenix,Is there a twokinds booth at sdcc?
15-07-2018T19:57:52,qwe304,yup
15-07-2018T19:57:58,unsteddyphoenix,Ooo
15-07-2018T19:57:59,Twokinds,I wouldn't go otherwise
15-07-2018T19:58:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,right next to Marvel's booth
15-07-2018T19:58:07,qwe304,official announcement on toms facebook
15-07-2018T19:58:09,Ordithus,A whole Keenspot booth at that I believe?
15-07-2018T19:58:11,Bgrmystr2,"It'd be bad for streaming, sending that much data to somewhere else in the world, then sending it all the way back xD"
15-07-2018T19:58:26,unsteddyphoenix,Tom has a facebook??
15-07-2018T19:58:28,unsteddyphoenix,Woah.

15-07-2018T19:58:41,Bgrmystr2,"qwe, it's true"
15-07-2018T19:58:47,unsteddyphoenix,Could set up a camera looking down at the sketch requests you get there :thinking:
15-07-2018T19:58:56,unsteddyphoenix,And stream that
15-07-2018T19:59:09,qwe304,i get %80 of my bandwith through my vpn with only about 40m/s aditional latency
15-07-2018T19:59:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,comicon wifi would be so sucky
15-07-2018T19:59:26,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah it'd prolly have to be his own data
15-07-2018T19:59:28,LannAF,Won't the hotel room have Wifi Tom?
15-07-2018T19:59:35,unsteddyphoenix,Ive seen youchuubers streaming at cons somehow though
15-07-2018T19:59:54,unsteddyphoenix,like on their phones
15-07-2018T19:59:55,Bgrmystr2,"yeah Lann, but everyone's gonna be using it probably"
15-07-2018T20:00:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Could be their won data like you said
15-07-2018T20:00:09,LannAF,"If you need to use chat and also have music, you can just use my phone if you'd like."
15-07-2018T20:00:40,LannAF,I'm honestly not sure what to expect at SDCC
15-07-2018T20:00:58,LannAF,Everyone says it's really crowded and such but- is it annoying amounts of crowded?
15-07-2018T20:01:06,Twokinds,lol
15-07-2018T20:01:20,LannAF,"Momocon was pretty alright, but I can't imagine there being 3x the amount of people"
15-07-2018T20:01:24,LannAF,I imagine SDCC is bigger.
15-07-2018T20:01:40,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I cant fathom that many congregated nerds
15-07-2018T20:01:43,Twokinds,It's a little sea of people
15-07-2018T20:02:00,Twokinds,You'll see
15-07-2018T20:02:05,MuonNeutrino,sounds scary &gt;.&gt;
15-07-2018T20:02:20,qwe304,too bad its halfway across the country :(
15-07-2018T20:02:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"ugh, good luck with that Tom"
15-07-2018T20:02:42,LannAF,I can't tell if that was an ominous you'll see
15-07-2018T20:02:42,unsteddyphoenix,Half way across the world~
15-07-2018T20:02:44,qwe304,and tickets were sold out months ago
15-07-2018T20:02:47,LannAF,Or a reassuring one
15-07-2018T20:02:51,unsteddyphoenix,One day I wanna go to one. Just to see what it's like
15-07-2018T20:03:05,Twokinds,It can take half an hour or more to get from one side of the convention hall to the other.
15-07-2018T20:03:05,unsteddyphoenix,*[YOU'LL SEE]
15-07-2018T20:03:12,LannAF,holy what

15-07-2018T20:04:25,MallardDuckAvia,Why was there a stream a few minutes ago and will there be another one tonight?
15-07-2018T20:04:27,Bgrmystr2,and she's got a great classic 80's anime artstyle feel
15-07-2018T20:04:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Test stream Mallard
15-07-2018T20:04:35,Bgrmystr2,"Mallard, today's stream was a test"

15-07-2018T20:04:51,MuonNeutrino,testing some technical stuff
15-07-2018T20:04:56,unsteddyphoenix,"So if you just go for one day, it's fun then Marv?"
15-07-2018T20:04:59,Ordithus,It was preparation for a possible stream from SDCC
15-07-2018T20:05:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I say yes, unsteddy"
15-07-2018T20:06:05,unsteddyphoenix,Hmm~

15-07-2018T20:06:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"go in spend the day, leave and go get some food, then crash the rest of the day away"
15-07-2018T20:06:45,Twokinds,lol yeah
15-07-2018T20:10:36,Twokinds,I have my doubts I'll get a comic out this week

15-07-2018T20:10:56,Twokinds,I've preloaded all my patreon and deviantart posts for now

15-07-2018T20:12:19,Twokinds,On the 18th. So... a day and a half from now.
15-07-2018T20:12:59,Bgrmystr2,you don't think you'd be able to upload the page from the convention?
15-07-2018T20:13:20,Twokinds,I could but I'd have to work on it
15-07-2018T20:13:27,Bgrmystr2,hm
15-07-2018T20:13:30,Twokinds,"Knowing cons, dunno if I'll have the energy."
15-07-2018T20:13:45,unsteddyphoenix,If it's just the text it's possible? Maybe?
15-07-2018T20:13:53,Ordithus,"Yeah, that would be rough"
15-07-2018T20:13:55,LannAF,Just chug like
15-07-2018T20:13:58,LannAF,two pots of coffee

15-07-2018T20:14:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,test stream
15-07-2018T20:14:51,Ordithus,It was only a test how did it end up like this
15-07-2018T20:14:54,Bgrmystr2,"well, ya always have today and tomorrow at the very least"
15-07-2018T20:15:02,Twokinds,Don't you see the stream? I'm streaming right now.
15-07-2018T20:15:07,Bgrmystr2,hahaha
15-07-2018T20:15:16,Bgrmystr2,obviously.
15-07-2018T20:15:17,Combak,"And it'd be quite reasonable to not have a page out this week, or sketches."
15-07-2018T20:15:22,LannAF,No Tom
15-07-2018T20:15:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,*hits f5*
15-07-2018T20:15:26,LannAF,Stream isn't going on my end
15-07-2018T20:15:37,LannAF,"Also, it's a test stream, not an actual one."
15-07-2018T20:15:38,unsteddyphoenix,I see it
15-07-2018T20:15:38,TheSexyBeast,"Lulz, I guess I haven't then!"

15-07-2018T20:18:05,Twokinds,Oh yeah
15-07-2018T20:18:06,LannAF,One of my friends asked me to get her an autograph from an Overwatch voice actor
15-07-2018T20:18:10,Twokinds,Depends on the person
15-07-2018T20:18:12,LannAF,But..I'm having my doubts now..
15-07-2018T20:18:23,Bgrmystr2,"how long are the lines for you, tom?"
15-07-2018T20:18:51,Twokinds,"Hm, you probably could, but you'd need to be prepared to wait in line for a couple hours or more"
15-07-2018T20:19:09,unsteddyphoenix,Tom has to draw stuff as well
15-07-2018T20:19:10,Twokinds,"You might get lucky though. I don't know, I've never tried waiting in line for something like that."
15-07-2018T20:19:37,LannAF,oof.
15-07-2018T20:19:46,LannAF,Suppose we'll see

15-07-2018T20:22:05,LannAF,Honestly I'm at a loss as to what I'm gonna be even doing a majority of the time other than occasionally swinging back your booth
15-07-2018T20:22:13,Twokinds,"You might not have to, I'll probably try to sneak there on Wed and see if I can nab em"
15-07-2018T20:22:15,LannAF,Not a single one of my friends are going :L
15-07-2018T20:22:27,LannAF,"either way, no sweat off my back"

15-07-2018T23:15:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Had the nausea first
15-07-2018T23:27:17,SpazztasticKiwi,How many times can you listen to a single song a row before it’s ridiculous
15-07-2018T23:27:31,SpazztasticKiwi,*in a row
15-07-2018T23:29:51,unsteddyphoenix,4+
15-07-2018T23:31:56,Bgrmystr2,"Define ""ridiculous"""
15-07-2018T23:37:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Too much
15-07-2018T23:38:00,SpazztasticKiwi,And it’s been on repeat more than 4 times
15-07-2018T23:38:24,unsteddyphoenix,...but why
15-07-2018T23:41:50,SpazztasticKiwi,It good
15-07-2018T23:42:34,Bgrmystr2,"why does listening to a song 4 times make it ""too much"" or ""rediculous"""
15-07-2018T23:42:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, as unrelated as it is, can you imagine the look Nibbly would give the camera as Maddie and Maeve dress her up like a baby doll"
15-07-2018T23:42:47,Bgrmystr2,sounds fake to me :thinking:
15-07-2018T23:44:25,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s the A Million Dreams song from The Greatest Showman. I’ve found the soundtrack likeable
15-07-2018T23:45:25,unsteddyphoenix,Ive thought of a similar one like that spazz
15-07-2018T23:45:36,unsteddyphoenix,'cept it's Kat dressing Nibbly up in cute outfits she made
15-07-2018T23:46:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Kat needs a mannequin room

15-07-2018T23:47:27,unsteddyphoenix,its on the list right after pants
15-07-2018T23:50:54,Dadrobit,And maybe some socks?
15-07-2018T23:51:22,unsteddyphoenix,Socks are above pants
15-07-2018T23:51:27,unsteddyphoenix,In priority
15-07-2018T23:51:48,SpazztasticKiwi,She’s gonna be the designer of the first Keidran thigh highs
15-07-2018T23:53:11,unsteddyphoenix,Accidentally becomes Mekkans first fashion designer
15-07-2018T23:53:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Asks Flora to be her first model
15-07-2018T23:53:44,SpazztasticKiwi,“Strut your stuff!”
15-07-2018T23:53:49,unsteddyphoenix,Flora does have the right build...
15-07-2018T23:53:50,SpazztasticKiwi,“What stuff?”

15-07-2018T23:57:26,SpazztasticKiwi,“When’s the bikini section?”
15-07-2018T23:58:36,Dadrobit,"Also, I'm constantly listening to songs on repeat. Yello - Oh Yeah"
15-07-2018T23:59:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"I remember Sage said he didn’t know bikinis well but I wonder if Tom does. If they’re all gonna be in swimsuits, there’s gotta be some variety"
15-07-2018T23:59:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Though he could go for dresses too
