21-07-2018T02:10:57,TorqueEmUp,"I was like ""Suzuki makes pickup trucks?!"""
21-07-2018T02:11:54,TorqueEmUp,Rare enough to see any kind of Suzuki that isn't rebadged.
21-07-2018T02:12:15,TorqueEmUp,Geo Metro = Suzuki Swift
21-07-2018T02:13:06,TorqueEmUp,Geo Tracker = Suzuki Sidekick

21-07-2018T14:32:15,FuryFaZeFurry,oh
21-07-2018T14:34:28,JamesBSquirrel3,"I not sure when we heard sketch expected due in, if Tom suppose to know after events."
21-07-2018T14:56:32,JamesBSquirrel3,"Well no respones, whenever btw 4 or 5 pm Sketches due in. What a coincidents?"
21-07-2018T14:58:18,Combak,"Well, since there's no sketch suggestion thing on Patreon, I'm guessing there's no stream today, and Tom'll pick sketches from the last batch of suggestions or random ones, if any at all."
21-07-2018T15:00:29,JamesBSquirrel3,good point ...
21-07-2018T15:01:44,FuryFaZeFurry,when does tom get back?
21-07-2018T15:02:11,JamesBSquirrel3,yes I feeling a same way.:ptv-wondering:
21-07-2018T15:08:32,SpazztasticKiwi,My sister had the fun experience of finding Kiwi’s beheaded present in the floor today
21-07-2018T15:09:41,JamesBSquirrel3,brb I'm making a bed before tomorrow
21-07-2018T15:52:00,JamesBSquirrel3,"wb So it is No Sketch today then. So approxitly next week, or too?"

21-07-2018T15:55:28,Vatruvius,I have no internet! Curse you AT&T!
21-07-2018T16:45:39,SpazztasticKiwi,AT&T: “Have you tried rebooting the router?”
21-07-2018T16:46:09,SpazztasticKiwi,“Or turning the device off and on?”
21-07-2018T17:11:01,Bgrmystr2,"""Have you tried doing everything you've already done when the problem is probably on our end even though we won't fix it?"
21-07-2018T17:11:09,Bgrmystr2,IPS.
21-07-2018T17:11:12,Bgrmystr2,ISPs*
21-07-2018T17:39:22,Darkehm,Hi! :3
21-07-2018T17:52:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Wassap
21-07-2018T17:55:38,Darkehm,Does anyone know what time it will start?
21-07-2018T17:55:52,Bgrmystr2,what time what is starting? There's no stream today.
21-07-2018T17:55:55,Bgrmystr2,Tom's at a convention
21-07-2018T17:56:00,Bgrmystr2,everyone knows.
21-07-2018T17:56:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Think today’s the last day but he still has to get home
21-07-2018T18:12:39,Ordithus,There is a remote chance for a late stream.  Keenspot has a panel at 4 PM PDT and Tom did try out a remote setup for streaming last week... but I expect he'll be beat after the con is over.  And the hotel wifi seemed slow Friday night.
21-07-2018T18:13:07,Ordithus,I'm saying this with no evidence or weight - I haven't talked with Tom
21-07-2018T18:17:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Has Tom ever done a panel with them
21-07-2018T18:17:36,Ordithus,I dunno
21-07-2018T18:17:42,Bgrmystr2,Yeah he said the wifi was terribad
21-07-2018T18:17:50,Bgrmystr2,that it couldn't keep up with one stream
21-07-2018T18:18:08,Bgrmystr2,so yeah the chances of him streaming there are unlikely
21-07-2018T18:18:17,Bgrmystr2,we can wait and see though
21-07-2018T18:18:18,Ordithus,Greater than 0% but not by a ton
21-07-2018T18:21:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Cool. Just looked at the schedule and he’s listed with the others but there’s no mention of a live feed for others at home
21-07-2018T18:22:42,Bgrmystr2,I don't think tom's gonna stream during the panel
21-07-2018T18:22:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Not him
21-07-2018T18:23:01,Bgrmystr2,he was testing out the stream so he could see if he could stream friday night in the hotel room
21-07-2018T18:23:40,SpazztasticKiwi,The people running the panel. Though SDCC probably isn’t like how PAX does panels and streams them as they happen
21-07-2018T20:02:04,Dadrobit,"Hm, gonna go out with the parents for a birthday dinner. Any suggestions?"
21-07-2018T20:07:17,Ordithus,Hibachi/Japanese
21-07-2018T20:27:16,Dadrobit,"Maybe, just did that a week ago though."
21-07-2018T20:28:55,Ordithus,"Ooh, nice.  I haven't had hibachi in a looong time"
21-07-2018T20:28:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Mexican
21-07-2018T20:29:02,SpazztasticKiwi,?
21-07-2018T20:29:22,Dadrobit,"Lol, I do Mexican every other night."
21-07-2018T20:29:35,Dadrobit,Maybe I'll try some American food for once lol.
21-07-2018T20:29:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Italian?
21-07-2018T20:29:43,SpazztasticKiwi,French?
21-07-2018T20:29:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Korean? Throw me a bone here
21-07-2018T20:30:06,Ordithus,Korean BBQ
21-07-2018T20:30:10,Dadrobit,"Italian sounds like a good option, dunno if we have any actual French around here."
21-07-2018T20:30:14,SpazztasticKiwi,McDonald’s. A+ birthday
21-07-2018T20:30:23,Ordithus,Dollar menu only
21-07-2018T20:31:08,SpazztasticKiwi,And a kiddie meal
21-07-2018T20:31:33,Dadrobit,"Whoa, I forgot that Happy Meals were even a thing."
21-07-2018T20:32:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Go get yourself a kiddie meal with a toy. Bonus points if you mention it’s for “his” birthday and roll through the drive through with a birthday hat on
21-07-2018T20:32:45,Ordithus,a BK birthday hat
21-07-2018T20:33:14,Dadrobit,Hahahahaha
21-07-2018T20:33:48,SpazztasticKiwi,*police sirens in the distance*
21-07-2018T20:34:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I saw some weird stuff when I worked at McHell so they probably wouldn’t bat an eye really
21-07-2018T20:35:24,Ordithus,"McHell, that's a good one."
21-07-2018T20:36:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Idiot came through one night with a mask on during that clown scare business
21-07-2018T20:36:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I just :ptv-unimpressed:
21-07-2018T20:37:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Almost deadpanned “Is that supposed to impress me” but didn’t want to get a complaint
21-07-2018T20:38:45,Ordithus,Somehow I never got too much for crazies aside from just jerks.  I suppose working opening shift kept things a bit more tame.
21-07-2018T20:39:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Nighttime is when the wtf comes out to play
21-07-2018T20:39:33,Ordithus,Mostly I just noticed how some folks going through the drivethru had bellies that matched the slope of their minivan's windshield
21-07-2018T20:39:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Had some dudes come through on horses
21-07-2018T20:39:57,Ordithus,Early morning is when you make so much coffee
21-07-2018T20:40:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"I got a knock at the window, open it to find like six people on horseback like “we didn’t set off the sensor but can we order from here?”"
21-07-2018T20:41:47,Ordithus,"Haha, wow.  Did they get anything for the horses?"
21-07-2018T20:42:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t think so. One or two started eating the curbside grass though
21-07-2018T20:43:03,SpazztasticKiwi,And the guy paying’s horse nearly stuck her head in the window
21-07-2018T20:43:39,Ordithus,"Probably curious, or smelled something it wanted"
21-07-2018T20:44:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"I just didn’t want her to bite me, or get spooked while her head was inside"
21-07-2018T20:44:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"Not to mention - not sanitary, even though I wasn’t a good preparer or around the food"
21-07-2018T20:45:32,SpazztasticKiwi,*wasn’t a food maker
21-07-2018T20:46:35,Ordithus,"Ah, McD's, you were my first ""real"" job and one I hated so, so badly."
21-07-2018T20:46:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I was the one to tell the people at the front that these customers may have to have their food run out to them
21-07-2018T20:47:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"To get their attention, I started with “I have some people on horses at my window”"
21-07-2018T20:47:32,SpazztasticKiwi,It worked
21-07-2018T20:47:56,Ordithus,"That seems to be a pretty accurate description of what was going on, yeah"
21-07-2018T20:49:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"One person got off their horse, dropped the lead, and went in to get some of the food, and I was thinking “nobody honk, nobody honk, nobody honk”"
21-07-2018T20:49:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"I didn’t want that horse, who was effectively lose from any control, to get spooked and run"
21-07-2018T20:51:54,Ordithus,I can still smell the breakfast burritos
21-07-2018T20:52:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"I like those things ok but considering how their made and what’s in them, the price makes no sense"
21-07-2018T20:53:17,SpazztasticKiwi,*they’re
21-07-2018T20:54:02,Ordithus,"Change of subject, but I really want some of the SDCC merch... look at Natani there: https://twitter.com/HoSalamanstra/status/1021193371413458944"
21-07-2018T20:54:26,Ordithus,"I've never had one  of the breakfast burritos.  Made thousands of them, never have had one."
21-07-2018T20:55:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Had to zoom. First thing I saw was that guy’s shirt
21-07-2018T20:56:03,Ordithus,"Tom's shirt is pretty obvious, but I have no idea what John's is."
21-07-2018T20:58:11,SpazztasticKiwi,And the random T. rex in the corner
21-07-2018T20:59:28,Ordithus,Friendly neighborhood T Rex.
21-07-2018T21:00:22,SpazztasticKiwi,A con is not a con without one t rex
21-07-2018T21:01:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, those merch rows is a neat freak’s dream"
21-07-2018T22:52:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Someone explain this “WTF Fact” I got today that a sushi date increases the chances of a second by 170%
21-07-2018T23:11:28,Dadrobit,"I think it's related to like how when you do something dangerous with someone else, they appear more attractive."
21-07-2018T23:12:04,Dadrobit,"Eating sushi is a very exotic thing for a lot of people, and I think that can have a similar effect."
21-07-2018T23:12:29,Dadrobit,"Speaking of food, just got back."
21-07-2018T23:12:40,Ordithus,wb what did you end up with
21-07-2018T23:12:42,Dadrobit,Went with an American/Italian restaraunt.
21-07-2018T23:12:53,Dadrobit,Red White and Brew
21-07-2018T23:12:54,Ordithus,good?
21-07-2018T23:13:21,Dadrobit,Very good. Got a BBQ Chicken pizza and a free slice of coffee ice cream cake.
21-07-2018T23:13:35,Dadrobit,drizzled in chocolate and caramel.
21-07-2018T23:14:05,Dadrobit,"About to head out again, gonna go see a movie tonight as well."
21-07-2018T23:14:24,Ordithus,"nice, have fun.  I'll be going to bed soon"
21-07-2018T23:14:50,Dadrobit,"Also, I've never actually seen Joseco before now, read his Salamanstra comi for the longest time though."
21-07-2018T23:14:56,Dadrobit,comic*
21-07-2018T23:15:31,Dadrobit,"Oh, and I'm jelly of the Natani poster. Someone should definitely get me one of those."
21-07-2018T23:15:56,Ordithus,Shut up and take my money! :ctwokinds-adiracoin:
21-07-2018T23:20:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I like the red booty shorts
21-07-2018T23:20:49,SpazztasticKiwi,At least that’s what I can make out
21-07-2018T23:22:47,Ordithus,And the cute lil pose
21-07-2018T23:22:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also I came into my room to go to bed after putting the milk up and Bagheera is open-mouth, dead-to-the-world, belly-up asleep"
21-07-2018T23:23:40,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-natanisleep:
21-07-2018T23:23:44,SpazztasticKiwi,He moved before I got a good picture
21-07-2018T23:25:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Some stuff seems to be con-sells only
21-07-2018T23:25:34,Dadrobit,"Heading out, cya'll later!"
21-07-2018T23:25:42,Ordithus,Ciao
21-07-2018T23:25:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t see why all of them are available online
21-07-2018T23:26:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Cept for the autograph aspect
21-07-2018T23:27:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I need to sleep too
21-07-2018T23:56:32,FuryFaZeFurry,i colored winter sunbathing if anybody is interested.
