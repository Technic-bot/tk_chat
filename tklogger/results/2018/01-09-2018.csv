01-09-2018T15:11:09,Twokinds,"SCPilot, Palmetto, I reject your suggestion for being too hard to draw!"
01-09-2018T15:11:16,ThingsAreMoving,lol
01-09-2018T15:11:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
01-09-2018T15:11:20,FennexTheFox,Lol
01-09-2018T15:11:21,BluePhantom90,what is that?
01-09-2018T15:11:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Aw
01-09-2018T15:11:23,ThingsAreMoving,what was it?
01-09-2018T15:11:24,NeonMitsumi,Lmao
01-09-2018T15:11:28,Mippy,ok
01-09-2018T15:11:29,Bgrmystr2,RIP xD
01-09-2018T15:11:35,Combak,"Oh, this should be good.."
01-09-2018T15:11:42,Twokinds,"6 characters, full bodies, three original"
01-09-2018T15:11:43,BadFoMo,What are they?
01-09-2018T15:11:45,ThingsAreMoving,wot
01-09-2018T15:11:46,Twokinds,No no no
01-09-2018T15:11:48,NeonMitsumi,Oof
01-09-2018T15:11:50,BadFoMo,Oh.
01-09-2018T15:11:53,Combak,"Oh boy, that's too much."
01-09-2018T15:11:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"""I reject you suggestion, and substitute my own&gt;"""
01-09-2018T15:11:58,FennexTheFox,That's a lot of draw
01-09-2018T15:12:03,Mippy,Oh gossh
01-09-2018T15:12:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Isn‚Äôt there a specified character limit of like 4?
01-09-2018T15:12:11,ThingsAreMoving,there is
01-09-2018T15:12:16,Mippy,Yup
01-09-2018T15:12:16,iliar,I wonder what they suggested.
01-09-2018T15:12:22,FennexTheFox,There is? Didn't know that
01-09-2018T15:12:25,Mippy,Some people no read
01-09-2018T15:12:34,SpazztasticKiwi,They should‚Äôve known better
01-09-2018T15:12:36,NeonMitsumi,Silly hoomans
01-09-2018T15:12:44,BadFoMo,"Wait, can I call dibs on there slots and have three requests?"
01-09-2018T15:12:46,FennexTheFox,This sign won't stop me because I can't read!
01-09-2018T15:12:46,ThingsAreMoving,but honestly anything over 3 should be exceptionally good to justify taking time to draw it
01-09-2018T15:12:50,Bgrmystr2,tom's put a soft cap of 4 people for like.. more than a year ago
01-09-2018T15:12:55,NeonMitsumi,"No, FoMo, they will all lose."
01-09-2018T15:12:56,Bgrmystr2,it's been there for a very long time
01-09-2018T15:12:56,Combak,Hardy har har FoMo.
01-09-2018T15:13:19,PalmettoPathfinder1,Well darn.  I forgot about the cap.  Well looks like I lucked out.  I just found out.
01-09-2018T15:13:27,JamesBSquirrel3,"wb I wonder what's strike a pose today? Will be something else; like Human kathrin, Therie Sah-Van, Raine, or Mean (Tigress) Girls? Just wondering."
01-09-2018T15:13:29,PalmettoPathfinder1,That my suggestion was rejected.
01-09-2018T15:13:40,NeonMitsumi,"Oh, we know."
01-09-2018T15:13:44,FennexTheFox,What was it?
01-09-2018T15:14:07,ThingsAreMoving,"Bad palmetto, trying to be sneaky with braking suggestion laws"
01-09-2018T15:14:10,PalmettoPathfinder1,It was the AU family of Sythe and Flora.  The weird thing is that he never rejected it in the past
01-09-2018T15:14:26,FennexTheFox,Aww that would have been cute
01-09-2018T15:14:28,Bgrmystr2,prolly cuz he finally actually read the request
01-09-2018T15:14:32,Twokinds,Well I only usually read the first sentence of every suggestion
01-09-2018T15:14:34,Bgrmystr2,instead of just copypasting it :P
01-09-2018T15:14:34,Combak,... What AU family?
01-09-2018T15:14:37,JamesBSquirrel3,Not my suggestion - just wondering.:ptv-wondering:
01-09-2018T15:14:38,ThingsAreMoving,was that the one that was usually near the last place anyway?
01-09-2018T15:14:39,Twokinds,Then delete everything else
01-09-2018T15:14:44,FennexTheFox,Lol relatable tom
01-09-2018T15:14:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Skimmer
01-09-2018T15:14:54,NeonMitsumi,"Nice, Tom."
01-09-2018T15:14:57,BadFoMo,@PalmettoPathfinder1 That's how I sort of wasted a week.
01-09-2018T15:15:12,Bgrmystr2,"also, that explains why so many suggestions are not exactly what ppl wanted xD"
01-09-2018T15:15:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"wait, so mine is gonna show up as ""End of summer volley ball match"" XD"
01-09-2018T15:15:19,ThingsAreMoving,xD
01-09-2018T15:15:30,PalmettoPathfinder1,It would have been cute.  But yeah.  I lucked out on this one.  :(  too late to submit another suggestion.
01-09-2018T15:15:35,ThingsAreMoving,stickfigure volleymatch
01-09-2018T15:15:37,BadFoMo,@Combak The one sythe and Flora could have had.
01-09-2018T15:15:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I thought we were supposed to keep em short n sweet
01-09-2018T15:15:50,Twokinds,Well it's just so detailed
01-09-2018T15:15:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Mine‚Äôs like one sentence
01-09-2018T15:16:04,ThingsAreMoving,same here
01-09-2018T15:16:07,Twokinds,"It's a good suggestion, but these kids are pretty much OCs"
01-09-2018T15:16:12,BadFoMo,"Wait, is mine ok?"
01-09-2018T15:16:18,FennexTheFox,Ohh that makes sense
01-09-2018T15:16:25,Twokinds,Which is also against the rules
01-09-2018T15:16:43,FennexTheFox,"So like if we just suggest ""AU where Flora and sythe had a family"" that would be ok?"
01-09-2018T15:16:47,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds does one sentence count if it has both a colon and a dash before full stop?
01-09-2018T15:16:52,JamesBSquirrel3,"Uh oh, right. That's a problem!"
01-09-2018T15:16:53,Combak,Probably Fennex.
01-09-2018T15:16:54,PalmettoPathfinder1,Well wasn't the one with Keith and Laura and their kids being OCs as well.
01-09-2018T15:17:01,Twokinds,I'm kidding about the one sentence thing
01-09-2018T15:17:06,CrimsonQuill,oh ok
01-09-2018T15:17:11,NeonMitsumi,Riiiiiiiiiiiiiight.
01-09-2018T15:17:15,Mippy,Good thing some of us actually read the rules
01-09-2018T15:17:15,Twokinds,"Just if it's really long, I go cross-eyed after a while"
01-09-2018T15:17:19,Combak,Remember Tom: /s
01-09-2018T15:17:25,Twokinds,Like some suggestions are 6-7 paragraphs
01-09-2018T15:17:28,CrimsonQuill,It's just I've been trying to get Spartan Raine on for a while-I kept it short and sweet
01-09-2018T15:17:31,FennexTheFox,Pssssh we all know Tom only reads the first word
01-09-2018T15:17:34,TorqueEmUp,"Honestly it should only be a sentance, and not a long one either."
01-09-2018T15:17:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need your life story, just tell me your suggestion‚Äù"
01-09-2018T15:17:46,ThingsAreMoving,6 paragraphs? damn
01-09-2018T15:17:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Isn't there a rule about keeping the suggestion short
01-09-2018T15:17:53,NeonMitsumi,I thought you added 300 character limit to your submissions.
01-09-2018T15:17:54,JamesBSquirrel3,"ONLY at least 7, fine"
01-09-2018T15:17:56,CrimsonQuill,None of my suggestions have made it so far though. Also 6 PARAGRAPHS?
01-09-2018T15:17:58,Twokinds,Yes don't do that please
01-09-2018T15:18:13,PalmettoPathfinder1,Wasn't the one of AU Keith and Laura and their family weren't the kids ocs as well?
01-09-2018T15:18:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Someone needs a character limit
01-09-2018T15:18:24,ThingsAreMoving,4chars though
01-09-2018T15:18:27,TorqueEmUp,Be short and concise.
01-09-2018T15:18:28,autoenigma,how many do you have to read?
01-09-2018T15:18:34,Combak,"... Not the super detailed sort, I'd think."
01-09-2018T15:18:35,Twokinds,Well I made those kids up
01-09-2018T15:18:44,CrimsonQuill,Nicely drawn though
01-09-2018T15:18:45,Combak,"Emphasis on the ""I"""
01-09-2018T15:18:48,FennexTheFox,"Dear Tom, *writes full life story* ""oh also could I pls have nekkid Keidran ladies kthxbai"""
01-09-2018T15:18:52,JamesBSquirrel3,"Look, I not saying everything, until what's first round, okay?"
01-09-2018T15:18:54,ThingsAreMoving,lol fox
01-09-2018T15:18:56,BadFoMo,"Inb4 I post my one fac-fic and, at the end, say a scean from this."
01-09-2018T15:19:00,Mippy,Yeah...they were Tom's OCs Palmetto
01-09-2018T15:19:01,TorqueEmUp,Most people won't read a huge long suggestion for voting anyway. lol
01-09-2018T15:19:10,Combak,A Fac-fic? XD
01-09-2018T15:19:19,ThingsAreMoving,a tic-tac
01-09-2018T15:19:20,Twokinds,Yeah I have to crop all the suggestions so it fits in the polling thing
01-09-2018T15:19:28,BadFoMo,Dang it! *Fan-fic
01-09-2018T15:19:32,Twokinds,"And then, at that point, it's all I see of it..."
01-09-2018T15:19:36,PalmettoPathfinder1,Ah.  Okay so there's the confusion.
01-09-2018T15:19:51,FennexTheFox,Does it ever get boring drawing the same characters for 14 years?
01-09-2018T15:19:53,CrimsonQuill,@Everyone what was the first suggestion you ever posted?
01-09-2018T15:19:57,FennexTheFox,Just wondering
01-09-2018T15:20:00,Combak,N/A
01-09-2018T15:20:05,ThingsAreMoving,"donno, crimson"
01-09-2018T15:20:08,Twokinds,Not really
01-09-2018T15:20:08,ThingsAreMoving,dunno
01-09-2018T15:20:12,JamesBSquirrel3,"Last round - 5 mins, but Round 1, 3 + 5, at 7 mins?"
01-09-2018T15:20:15,Combak,@CrimsonQuill: N/A
01-09-2018T15:20:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"With as messy as some of this seems, it‚Äôs a wonder you don‚Äôt have some sort of secretary"
01-09-2018T15:20:37,BadFoMo,@CrimsonQuill Suddenly Tails maybe?
01-09-2018T15:20:41,PalmettoPathfinder1,Anyhow I lucked out on this stream.  Don't think I can submit a new suggestion since I recall from a past stream that Tom said if I reject your suggestion you can't make any for the rest of the month.
01-09-2018T15:20:42,FennexTheFox,"You're pretty odd to me, Tom, lol. Can't fathom how you do it. I get bored of my characters fairly quickly"
01-09-2018T15:20:44,ThingsAreMoving,I think mine was ceiling Kat which was picked by Tom
01-09-2018T15:20:49,ThingsAreMoving,mem quality too high
01-09-2018T15:20:51,PalmettoPathfinder1,Or was that someone else's rules?
01-09-2018T15:20:51,FenceEqualizer,"Diplomatic strip poker, crimson"
01-09-2018T15:20:58,Twokinds,I've never said that
01-09-2018T15:21:06,Twokinds,If you changed it now I'd put it in
01-09-2018T15:21:07,CrimsonQuill,I remember my first suggestion was Tom's Brother Mar (King of Fnaf) teaching Raine how to play the game
01-09-2018T15:21:11,CrimsonQuill,Mark
01-09-2018T15:21:12,Combak,"Yeah, gotta be someone else Pal."
01-09-2018T15:21:13,Bgrmystr2,that wasn't tom's rule no
01-09-2018T15:21:21,PalmettoPathfinder1,Okay it must have been someone else then.
01-09-2018T15:21:23,Bgrmystr2,sounds like a dumb rool imo
01-09-2018T15:21:28,Bgrmystr2,rule* even
01-09-2018T15:21:28,FennexTheFox,"Change it palmetto, I wanna see cute wolfykittens"
01-09-2018T15:21:31,PalmettoPathfinder1,It is.
01-09-2018T15:21:46,Bgrmystr2,roools r 4 looozrs &gt;:U
01-09-2018T15:21:55,Twokinds,I can still do Flora and Sythe have a family
01-09-2018T15:21:57,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, probably mis-read and Tom probably said if I reject your suggestion, you can't submit a new one until the next week."
01-09-2018T15:22:00,ThingsAreMoving,anarchy on the stream \m/
01-09-2018T15:22:04,Combak,"Eh, I can see a reason for it, Bgr. Makes sure people have read the rules."
01-09-2018T15:22:12,Twokinds,It's just probably not going to be exactly all the details you included
01-09-2018T15:22:30,Bgrmystr2,I don't see a reason for having their suggestion rejected being that they lose the ability to suggest lol
01-09-2018T15:22:34,FennexTheFox,My first suggestion was Keith cosplaying as Pip from Paladins
01-09-2018T15:22:37,JamesBSquirrel3,Hope if most vote got it right whatever each round.
01-09-2018T15:22:48,Bgrmystr2,"there is no right or wrong with votes, james"
01-09-2018T15:22:52,Bgrmystr2,just what people want.
01-09-2018T15:22:57,FennexTheFox,Unfortunately nobody here plays the game so it lost like twice in a row
01-09-2018T15:23:01,Bgrmystr2,that's why it's called voting
01-09-2018T15:23:02,ThingsAreMoving,vox populi - vox dei
01-09-2018T15:23:04,Combak,"Oh, I remember that suggestion @FennexTheFox!"
01-09-2018T15:23:05,JamesBSquirrel3,I know its a thing
01-09-2018T15:23:06,FenceEqualizer,Which is Kat doing a thang
01-09-2018T15:23:10,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds what's your favourite thing about these streams?
01-09-2018T15:23:14,PalmettoPathfinder1,Okay Tom that works for me.  I like that compromise.  I do hope you keep Sythe and Flora having tiger stripped wolf twins. :)
01-09-2018T15:23:22,MallardDuckAvia,Is there a stream today?
01-09-2018T15:23:27,NeonMitsumi,@CrimsonQuill Them ending.
01-09-2018T15:23:28,FennexTheFox,Yes ducky
01-09-2018T15:23:30,BadFoMo,Inb4 Tom: When they end.
01-09-2018T15:23:34,ThingsAreMoving,lol
01-09-2018T15:23:36,NeonMitsumi,Ha
01-09-2018T15:23:36,CrimsonQuill,I asked Tom
01-09-2018T15:23:36,Bgrmystr2,"Probably not the beginning quill, where people keep bothering him while he's trying to set up :P"
01-09-2018T15:23:49,MallardDuckAvia,I hope my Sealeen wins this time
01-09-2018T15:23:53,NeonMitsumi,"We know, Quill."
01-09-2018T15:24:00,JamesBSquirrel3,Okay 5 mins&gt; to due in set.
01-09-2018T15:24:08,CrimsonQuill,These chats always confuse me
01-09-2018T15:24:13,CrimsonQuill,So much is going on.
01-09-2018T15:24:13,Combak,"Sealeen poisons the town, @MallardDuckAvia?"
01-09-2018T15:24:20,TorqueEmUp,Are we bothering him? I mean he could just ignore us if he wanted to get things going.
01-09-2018T15:24:20,MallardDuckAvia,Yeah
01-09-2018T15:24:30,Bgrmystr2,"Mallard, maybe you should take note that today is sunday lol"
01-09-2018T15:24:31,CrimsonQuill,Probably.
01-09-2018T15:24:34,PalmettoPathfinder1,So Tom you okay with the compromise then?
01-09-2018T15:24:39,BadFoMo,@MallardDuckAvia I think I'll vote for it.
01-09-2018T15:24:56,CrimsonQuill,Hooray for multiple votes!
01-09-2018T15:25:01,MallardDuckAvia,I know. I just haven‚Äôt gotten a notification yet
01-09-2018T15:25:02,CrimsonQuill,Or rather PR
01-09-2018T15:25:09,MallardDuckAvia,My internet is crap
01-09-2018T15:25:26,MallardDuckAvia,Thank you BadFoMo
01-09-2018T15:25:26,Combak,Notification for what? The stream isn't live yet. XD
01-09-2018T15:25:31,CrimsonQuill,I'll be up for a while
01-09-2018T15:25:32,PalmettoPathfinder1,Mallard I live in a dead zone.
01-09-2018T15:25:39,CrimsonQuill,It's 9:25 here
01-09-2018T15:25:47,FennexTheFox,We just lurk here sometimes mallard
01-09-2018T15:25:51,PalmettoPathfinder1,I know your pain.
01-09-2018T15:26:03,MallardDuckAvia,I live in a place where Cox is the only provider
01-09-2018T15:26:04,Bgrmystr2,"lol Torque, reasons why tom is decidedly absent from the chat for a few mins at a time xD"
01-09-2018T15:26:04,FenceEqualizer,All 120 peeps lurking
01-09-2018T15:26:08,MallardDuckAvia,Cox is terrible
01-09-2018T15:26:11,CrimsonQuill,Most of the chat happens when the rest if the country is asleep
01-09-2018T15:26:14,Combak,Cox sucks itslef?
01-09-2018T15:26:15,CrimsonQuill,of
01-09-2018T15:26:17,Combak,*itself
01-09-2018T15:26:25,MallardDuckAvia,Yeah
01-09-2018T15:26:27,Bgrmystr2,yes combak
01-09-2018T15:26:27,JamesBSquirrel3,"When the red light circle Not. is on of Tom, not somebody else record live."
01-09-2018T15:26:30,Bgrmystr2,yes it does.
01-09-2018T15:26:36,Bgrmystr2,and still somehow survives.
01-09-2018T15:26:46,Combak,Lack of competition.
01-09-2018T15:26:50,PalmettoPathfinder1,I do apologize about the confusion tom. Forgot about the character cap and being detailed.
01-09-2018T15:26:51,Bgrmystr2,truth
01-09-2018T15:26:53,FenceEqualizer,Monopoly is a powerful thing BGR
01-09-2018T15:27:06,ThingsAreMoving,enforced monopoly should be illegal
01-09-2018T15:27:13,Bgrmystr2,no competition in the ISP / cable network world..
01-09-2018T15:27:15,ThingsAreMoving,oh wait
01-09-2018T15:27:16,Bgrmystr2,"it is, things"

01-09-2018T15:27:23,FennexTheFox,"I hate picarto sometimes. Bugs out on all mobile browsers for me, desktop mode doesn't fix it, and the app only shows me the chat"
01-09-2018T15:27:23,ThingsAreMoving,xD
01-09-2018T15:27:30,Bgrmystr2,a lot of good it's doing
01-09-2018T15:27:35,FennexTheFox,Gotta pull out my laptop to watch the draws
01-09-2018T15:27:38,BadFoMo,I like TF!
01-09-2018T15:27:40,FenceEqualizer,Yet the big companies do there best to screw everything
01-09-2018T15:27:49,MallardDuckAvia,It breaks for me when battery saver is on
01-09-2018T15:27:51,FenceEqualizer,Their*
01-09-2018T15:28:03,JamesBSquirrel3,maybe a upgrade version of picarto was ...
01-09-2018T15:28:05,TorqueEmUp,"Agreed Spectrum is the only ISP worth having around here, everyone else give you absolute crap for the same money."
01-09-2018T15:28:21,PalmettoPathfinder1,Anyone here looking forward to Cyberpunk 2077?
01-09-2018T15:28:25,Bgrmystr2,it's prolly not giving you anything worth of value though
01-09-2018T15:28:26,FenceEqualizer,Didn't AT&T and the like drive away google fiber?
01-09-2018T15:28:38,Bgrmystr2,"don't.. think so, Fence"
01-09-2018T15:28:44,ThingsAreMoving,"europe may be a whole lot smaller than the nothern america, but thanks to that our internet infrastructure is great"
01-09-2018T15:29:03,FennexTheFox,I have Cox and we have to pay over 60 a month to get over 20 down
01-09-2018T15:29:11,PalmettoPathfinder1,I'm torn between Cyberpunk 2077 and Tunic.
01-09-2018T15:29:11,FenceEqualizer,Might be remembering wrong just could have sworn they most certainly pushed back
01-09-2018T15:29:22,MallardDuckAvia,I live is the 5th largest city in the country and we only have one provider and they are crap
01-09-2018T15:29:30,JamesBSquirrel3,1 min&gt; due in ...
01-09-2018T15:29:32,TorqueEmUp,"I pay $60 a month for 100mbps down, and like 10mbps up."
01-09-2018T15:29:34,Bgrmystr2,"you don't have shitty ppl trying to control your internet cuz you don't have any rules that state your ISP can't restrict wtf ever they don't want you to see, Things."
01-09-2018T15:29:47,ThingsAreMoving,truth
01-09-2018T15:29:54,Bgrmystr2,so that's likely one of the reasons why you're not limited as much as we are
01-09-2018T15:29:55,TorqueEmUp,"next best thing is AT&T with the 1TB data cap, and 25mbps down."

01-09-2018T15:30:35,FennexTheFox,I hate being home just because of the internet here. My university gets 600 down and 100 up in the dorms if you can deal with the 20 min nightly outages
01-09-2018T15:30:40,TerraTheWizard,"i agree, combak"
01-09-2018T15:30:41,ThingsAreMoving,in my home country you can get 1Gbit/250Mbit down/up for the equivalent of 40$
01-09-2018T15:30:46,NeonMitsumi,No one wants it. lol
01-09-2018T15:30:46,Bgrmystr2,we're about $75 or so for 200mbit down and like.. 15 up or something
01-09-2018T15:30:57,Bgrmystr2,"yeah see, things gets good internet"
01-09-2018T15:31:02,Combak,And so it continues to be a thing.
01-09-2018T15:31:07,CrimsonQuill,All I know about mine is that I can play Fortnite on it without too much lag

01-09-2018T15:31:37,Bgrmystr2,It's iliar's bot
01-09-2018T15:31:41,TorqueEmUp,Too many paid off politicians letting ISPs in the states do what they want to keep their monopolies.

01-09-2018T16:04:52,ThingsAreMoving,I am odd
01-09-2018T16:05:01,CatzArt,I once saw a deer eat a piece of salami. carnivorous deer are dangerous.
01-09-2018T16:05:15,Mippy,Oh gosh...I haven‚Äôt watched that series in years

01-09-2018T16:05:58,unsteddyphoenix,chickens are coming
01-09-2018T16:06:07,Mippy,"I don‚Äôt know if that is hilarious or cruel, Things"
01-09-2018T16:06:11,CatzArt,the sky is falling
01-09-2018T16:06:12,phil199,"chickens are weird, also they¬¥re dorks and a bit stupid"

01-09-2018T16:06:29,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. pigs like bacon.. so it's not out of the ordinary
01-09-2018T16:06:34,ThingsAreMoving,same as soaking bread with wine before feeding it to some ducks at a park
01-09-2018T16:06:42,Bgrmystr2,"nature is brutal, yo"
01-09-2018T16:06:44,ThingsAreMoving,drunk ducks are hilarious

01-09-2018T16:07:32,unsteddyphoenix,Chicken Run was top tier
01-09-2018T16:07:33,ThingsAreMoving,was that the clay animation thingie?
01-09-2018T16:07:36,CatzArt,gave me nightmares as a kid
01-09-2018T16:07:39,BadFoMo,"Never saw it, but I remember it."
01-09-2018T16:07:39,Mippy,My farm friends once fed fermented crab apples to some chickens. They had drunk chickens for a while
01-09-2018T16:07:40,CrimsonQuill,I love that film
01-09-2018T16:07:54,CrimsonQuill,'I told you they was organised!'
01-09-2018T16:07:58,ThingsAreMoving,Watership down gave me nightmares
01-09-2018T16:07:58,Twokinds,Sorry brb

01-09-2018T16:08:20,CrimsonQuill,'I don;t want to be a pie! I don't like gravy!'
01-09-2018T16:08:28,Mippy,Chicken Run is not a bad movie. Haven‚Äôt seen it in a while.
01-09-2018T16:08:34,CatzArt,uh oh tom left because we are on to the chicken revolution he is planning
01-09-2018T16:08:39,CrimsonQuill,We have it on DVD
01-09-2018T16:08:43,PalmettoPathfinder1,Anyone like the new Voltron series?
01-09-2018T16:08:45,JamesBSquirrel3,"Oh dear Tom, having trouble with that/;"

01-09-2018T16:09:43,Mippy,Don‚Äôt know Palmetto. Can‚Äôt like something I have t seen. Last time I watched a Vomtron series it was that CGI one
01-09-2018T16:09:59,CatzArt,their is a new 2d one out witch is nice
01-09-2018T16:10:03,Xexanoth,"the ""new"" one is pretty dope"
01-09-2018T16:10:04,PalmettoPathfinder1,Voltron is where five space explorers discover five giant robot lions that can merge together to form a giant humanoid robot to battle an evil space empire.
01-09-2018T16:10:05,GC1983,"Voltron was an amazing cartoon in the 80s like transformers and Ninja turtles. If you've never seen int CrimsonQuill go on netflix and check out the current series, it's pretty awesome"
01-09-2018T16:10:14,ThingsAreMoving,o/ Xex
01-09-2018T16:10:31,Xexanoth,Hi things
01-09-2018T16:10:31,CatzArt,"I,ve been watching Overlord though. season three is turning out great"
01-09-2018T16:10:36,BluePhantom90,yes the New Voltron is amazing!!!
01-09-2018T16:10:41,ThingsAreMoving,tansformers and ninja turtles? sounds like power rangers
01-09-2018T16:10:43,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, if it's from the 80s then Michael Bay will touch it then."
01-09-2018T16:10:59,Mippy,I think it ‚Äúthe third dimension‚Äù or something ...use to be on Teletoon in Canada
01-09-2018T16:11:19,Xexanoth,You should read the Overlord novels instead @CatzArt
01-09-2018T16:11:36,PalmettoPathfinder1,Soon Michael Bay will have touched all of the 80s cartoons and redo them as live action movies.
01-09-2018T16:11:39,GC1983,oops lost my subcriber icon. Brb i need to fix that.
01-09-2018T16:11:52,Tharkis,:ctharkis-ewok:

01-09-2018T16:12:29,unsteddyphoenix,:heavy_dollar_sign:
01-09-2018T16:12:34,PalmettoPathfinder1,And then Michael Bay will touch the Titanic movie.  Then he will control the world!
01-09-2018T16:12:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-adiracoin:
01-09-2018T16:12:49,CatzArt,Going back to the chicken topic for a moment I remember four score and twenty years ago in the twokinds comic Rose had a chat with some templar thugs who tried to step into traces house and were turned into some animals. I vote that they are chickens.
01-09-2018T16:12:52,NeonMitsumi,You didn't! Good job! :kiwi:
01-09-2018T16:13:06,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-daydreamingkat: Thanks~
01-09-2018T16:13:09,Mippy,Well...maybe Mr.Bay can make a better Titanic movie
01-09-2018T16:13:16,BadFoMo,"@PalmettoPathfinder1 Then he may move onto the 90s and make movies about Ed, Edd, n' Eddy and Beavis & Butthead."
01-09-2018T16:13:21,PalmettoPathfinder1,Oh no!  A wild snow mew has appeared to hug us!

01-09-2018T18:01:04,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Indeed.  I can relate!  You think you're done when you get the hospital bill, but no you're not! You got to pay the ER doctor, the person who looks at your X-Rays, the people who test your urine and blood samples, the nurses, and anyone else who tests you"
01-09-2018T18:01:21,Twokinds,That's why I've never been to the hospital
01-09-2018T18:01:38,boiguy123,I have it sucked

01-09-2018T18:02:54,TorqueEmUp,Yeah I don't go to the doctor all that often either.

01-09-2018T18:03:15,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, sometimes you have no choice but to go to the doctor sometimes."
01-09-2018T18:03:27,boiguy123,Sadly
01-09-2018T18:03:31,PalmettoPathfinder1,Especially if you want to get vaccinated
01-09-2018T18:03:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Just don‚Äôt break a bone

01-09-2018T18:04:25,CrimsonQuill,I have no pad
01-09-2018T18:04:33,CrimsonQuill,And I can't draw with a mouse

01-09-2018T18:04:47,MallardDuckAvia,I just use a mouse
01-09-2018T18:04:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Only thing I can draw is flies

01-09-2018T18:05:27,boiguy123,I wish I had a pad
01-09-2018T18:05:28,Twokinds,"Which is rediculous. It's the biggest expense I pay, and I never even use it."
01-09-2018T18:05:33,CrRAR,"Did you just remember Tom, lol?"
01-09-2018T18:05:43,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds I've seen the ads

01-09-2018T18:05:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"its one of those, have it and not need it, then to need it and not have it type of things"
01-09-2018T18:06:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Like
01-09-2018T18:06:01,CrimsonQuill,I don't know how it is in the States
01-09-2018T18:06:03,unsteddyphoenix,Doubles as method acting zens character
01-09-2018T18:06:05,boiguy123,Well at least Tom it‚Äôs just in case
01-09-2018T18:06:05,Twokinds,Eh
01-09-2018T18:06:11,Bgrmystr2,"that'll make the amount he pays go up, phoenix"
01-09-2018T18:06:11,Twokinds,Why would I get a checkup if there's nothing wrong
01-09-2018T18:06:19,unsteddyphoenix,Oh no!
01-09-2018T18:06:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,to show off that nothing is wrong
01-09-2018T18:06:24,CrimsonQuill,"@Twokinds The Irish Healthcare system isn;t the best either though,"
01-09-2018T18:06:27,InTheLionsDen,To make use of the service you are paying for.
01-09-2018T18:06:31,SpazztasticKiwi,You‚Äôre supposed to go now and then even when you feel ok cause some things don‚Äôt hit immediately and others you don‚Äôt always get symptoms
01-09-2018T18:06:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,bragin rights
01-09-2018T18:06:40,PalmettoPathfinder1,Be careful Tom for one day you might need to use that insurance.  Especially if your hands mess up.
01-09-2018T18:06:42,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds or the NHS
01-09-2018T18:06:43,Bgrmystr2,"if you have insurance, and then you have to use that insurance for whatever reason, the amount you pay goes up."
01-09-2018T18:07:03,Bgrmystr2,a lot of em do that
01-09-2018T18:07:08,boiguy123,Sigh it always does
01-09-2018T18:07:24,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, it goes up naturally without you doing anything.."
01-09-2018T18:07:32,Bgrmystr2,but it goes up even moreso if you use it
01-09-2018T18:07:41,MallardDuckAvia,So does anyone want to draw?
01-09-2018T18:07:54,PalmettoPathfinder1,Spazz is correct.
01-09-2018T18:08:16,PalmettoPathfinder1,I'm not sure Mallard.  I don't have an art program.

01-09-2018T18:09:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Like a runaway garbage truck
01-09-2018T18:09:43,Twokinds,I feel terrible for the people living there
01-09-2018T18:09:53,boiguy123,I used to
01-09-2018T18:10:00,Twokinds,It's terrifying to think your money can just suddenly become worthless
01-09-2018T18:10:04,MallardDuckAvia,So nobody wants to draw with me
01-09-2018T18:10:07,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds It is.
01-09-2018T18:10:13,MallardDuckAvia,It‚Äôs free and online
01-09-2018T18:10:20,Dadrobit,"That's why I work for ""Exposure"""
01-09-2018T18:10:21,CrimsonQuill,@MallardDuckAvia I can't
01-09-2018T18:10:24,boiguy123,Yeh that‚Äôs why we moved before it was to late
01-09-2018T18:10:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Their inflation is supposed to hit like 200% soon isn‚Äôt it
01-09-2018T18:10:29,MallardDuckAvia,Ok
01-09-2018T18:10:31,CrRAR,"Mmm, Cuba common currency is kinda the same way."
01-09-2018T18:10:56,CrRAR,They have 2 varieties of currency.
01-09-2018T18:10:59,boiguy123,Now you can‚Äôt even book a flight anymore
01-09-2018T18:11:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I got concerned about the latest shooting. A gaming competition
01-09-2018T18:11:27,Bgrmystr2,"the US Dollar isn't backed by gold anymore, hasn't been for many years, so it's entirely possible for the dollar to also reach critical levels of inflation"
01-09-2018T18:11:30,unsteddyphoenix,I heard about that
01-09-2018T18:11:37,unsteddyphoenix,"Iroincally, the game was Madden"
01-09-2018T18:11:39,SpazztasticKiwi,A lot of people I follow are in gaming competitions
01-09-2018T18:11:48,CrRAR,"One is more of a ""global"" currency but it's harder to earn or something."
01-09-2018T18:11:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I went to a gaming convention myself
01-09-2018T18:12:08,boiguy123,Well bye Tom hope you get better
01-09-2018T18:12:19,swack24,What's worse is the shooter is last years champ on Madden
01-09-2018T18:12:29,swack24,so basically he;s a sore loser gone too far
01-09-2018T18:12:35,MallardDuckAvia,Hey Twokinds will there be another stream tonight or will I have to wait until later this week
01-09-2018T18:12:39,Dadrobit,Saw a video of a livestream. You could see the red dot on the chest of one of the players seconds before the gunfire started.
01-09-2018T18:12:42,SpazztasticKiwi,He‚Äôs not worth mentioning
01-09-2018T18:12:57,Twokinds,Not tonight

01-09-2018T18:22:14,Twokinds,It'll cost $300 to set her up in a cat hotel
01-09-2018T18:22:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Got a neighbor that could take her?
01-09-2018T18:22:29,unsteddyphoenix,But she deserves it~

01-09-2018T18:23:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"How long are you gonna be in Korea, if its not long then you might be able to leave at home."
01-09-2018T18:23:45,Twokinds,She will not be happy to spend two weeks in an unfamiliar setting
01-09-2018T18:23:46,unsteddyphoenix,Splurge on a cat-private suite :D
01-09-2018T18:23:50,SpazztasticKiwi,House sitter? Just to come by and make sure the bowls are full and the dogs get a walk?

01-09-2018T18:24:21,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah hiring a stranger would be spooky
01-09-2018T18:24:23,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds What about Mark?
01-09-2018T18:24:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Well that‚Äôs depressing

01-09-2018T18:24:44,CrimsonQuill,Oh right Ok.
01-09-2018T18:25:08,CrimsonQuill,I also forgot to consider CHica's attitude to cats...
01-09-2018T18:25:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"Bob and Wade live in Cincinnati, don‚Äôt they? Or nearby? Could they be asked?"
01-09-2018T18:26:45,CrimsonQuill,Who knows?
01-09-2018T18:26:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Only other option may be posting ads for it and holding a few interviews
01-09-2018T18:27:31,Twokinds,I don't know Bob or Wade
01-09-2018T18:27:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Well
01-09-2018T18:27:52,CrimsonQuill,This is what happens when we follow both of the Fischbach brothers
01-09-2018T18:27:55,CrimsonQuill,Confusion
01-09-2018T18:28:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Ads and interviews then
01-09-2018T18:28:30,unsteddyphoenix,Probably the hotel is the way
01-09-2018T18:28:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Bob and Wade are Mark‚Äôs friends from college and now YouTube
01-09-2018T18:28:44,unsteddyphoenix,Im sure they deal with anti-social cats?
01-09-2018T18:29:24,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs probably not logical they‚Äôd be able to do it anyway to be completely honest. Bad idea I guess
01-09-2018T18:30:09,TorqueEmUp,Cats aren't anti-social?
01-09-2018T18:30:16,TorqueEmUp,=P

01-09-2018T18:31:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh Bagheera is special
01-09-2018T18:31:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I believe that
01-09-2018T18:31:39,Bgrmystr2,"""Unique and special personality"" Yeah it's called being disappointed at everything 100% of the time, and demanding food 50% of the time"
01-09-2018T18:32:00,SpazztasticKiwi,So cats always give 150%?
01-09-2018T18:32:04,Bgrmystr2,yes
01-09-2018T18:32:05,Bgrmystr2,yes they do
01-09-2018T18:32:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Unsteddy, we finally have a name for the new kitty, Charlie Baltimore"
01-09-2018T18:32:10,unsteddyphoenix,Way to generalise :ctwokinds-FloDance:

01-09-2018T18:32:52,Bgrmystr2,"maybe, maybe not, but kiwi you have to give it to them. that's 150% reaction"
01-09-2018T18:32:55,Bgrmystr2,absolutely.

01-09-2018T18:34:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, I hereby give Tom a procrastinator award for waiting this long to look for a cat babysitter"
01-09-2018T18:34:42,CrimsonQuill,My GrandDad says 'You don't own a cat. A cat owns you.'
01-09-2018T18:34:44,unsteddyphoenix,Eh he has like 2 weeks
01-09-2018T18:34:47,TorqueEmUp,Still got two weeks

01-09-2018T18:38:13,TorqueEmUp,I mean regardless his cat is going to be stressed out anyway with Tom not being there.
01-09-2018T18:38:19,CrimsonQuill,"I looked to my right and a big spider was right beside me, crawling across my bed."
01-09-2018T18:38:24,CrimsonQuill,Not nice.
01-09-2018T18:38:29,Dadrobit,Beetlejuice Beetlejuice Beetlejuice
01-09-2018T18:38:39,CrimsonQuill,I had to squash it with a shoe.

01-09-2018T18:39:02,CrimsonQuill,Terror is up.
01-09-2018T18:39:06,CrimsonQuill,I HATE spiders
01-09-2018T18:39:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Well with that kind of reaction I doubt they like you too much either
01-09-2018T18:39:42,CrimsonQuill,Probably not.
01-09-2018T18:39:58,CrimsonQuill,But it was RIGHT THERE! Euugggh...
01-09-2018T18:40:04,TorqueEmUp,if they had the mental capacity for emotion.
01-09-2018T18:40:06,Dadrobit,I like Daddy Longlegs (of course I do (And yes I know they're not technically spiders)) but pretty much every other spider can heck off.
01-09-2018T18:40:16,CrimsonQuill,I feel like Ron from Chamber of Secrets. 'Can we panic now?'
01-09-2018T18:40:27,unsteddyphoenix,Theyre not spiders? ??
01-09-2018T18:40:32,CrimsonQuill,I respect spiders. They are amzing creatures.
01-09-2018T18:40:35,Dadrobit,Nope
01-09-2018T18:40:38,CrimsonQuill,I just hate them.
01-09-2018T18:40:46,CrimsonQuill,There are Daddy Long Legged spiders.
01-09-2018T18:40:56,Twokinds,I don't think my cat has her vaccinations up to date
01-09-2018T18:40:58,CrimsonQuill,I had a house spider-bigger and nastier
01-09-2018T18:41:07,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds Vaccinations?
01-09-2018T18:41:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"Well to board her, they‚Äôll require that"
01-09-2018T18:41:24,SpazztasticKiwi,And that‚Äôll rack up the price
01-09-2018T18:41:38,TorqueEmUp,yay more money!
01-09-2018T18:42:40,Dadrobit,"Daddy Longlegs are arachnids, but they differ from spiders because the whole apparatus lies in only one body cavity."
01-09-2018T18:43:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"This is just turning into a wonderful day for you, huh Tom"
01-09-2018T18:43:16,PalmettoPathfinder1,You know I should request a pic of Freya and Zidane from FFIX meeting Flora and Trace...and Zidane and Trace having hold back Freya and Flora from tearing each other apart (mouse vs cat if you will).
01-09-2018T18:43:17,unsteddyphoenix,Huh.
01-09-2018T18:43:21,unsteddyphoenix,What a fun fact
01-09-2018T18:43:58,Twokinds,Can it just be Freya and Flora?
01-09-2018T18:44:07,Twokinds,That would make it a lot easier
01-09-2018T18:44:36,CrimsonQuill,What's FFIX?
01-09-2018T18:44:45,MallardDuckAvia,If the Sealeen spiking Edinmires water sketch is chosen what would it look like tom?

01-09-2018T18:45:16,Dadrobit,The last final fantasy in the main series to use only pre-rendered backgrounds.
01-09-2018T18:45:29,PalmettoPathfinder1,Hm....I guess so.  I guess I could have them insult each other with Trace and Zidane off screen yelling at Freya and Flora no don't kill each other.
01-09-2018T18:45:41,Dadrobit,"Ten used them, but not completely."
01-09-2018T18:45:54,Dadrobit,IIRC

01-09-2018T18:47:09,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Although it would have been funnier with Trace and Zidane in there pulling them apart.  But if Tom's hands are giving out, it would make sense to request suggestions with at most three characters."
01-09-2018T18:47:13,CrimsonQuill,Duck.EXE has stopped Working

01-09-2018T18:51:19,MallardDuckAvia,I raised 13 ducks and a few of them have families in the wild now
01-09-2018T18:51:22,CrimsonQuill,Our duck cyclops got his eye gouged out by a cockerel. Hence his name.
01-09-2018T18:51:26,CrimsonQuill,It was nasty.
01-09-2018T18:51:36,CrimsonQuill,We killed the cockerel after that.
01-09-2018T18:51:43,PalmettoPathfinder1,Freya: You're a big cat.  Flora: You're a big mouse.  Both: I don't like you and thus I must destroy you!  Zidane and Trace: NO! FLORA! FREYA! DON'T DESTROY EACH OTHER! UGH! (Trace and Zidane are off screen)

01-09-2018T18:57:29,Dadrobit,"Nah, Jeff Goldblum would be either Trace or Neutral. They're the ones that made ""life finds a way"" a thing."
01-09-2018T18:57:32,CrimsonQuill,Yangchuangosaurus
01-09-2018T18:57:34,MallardDuckAvia,Australovenator

01-09-2018T18:57:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Trace is definitely proof that life finds a way

01-09-2018T18:58:33,CrimsonQuill,Tarbosaurus
01-09-2018T18:58:36,Dadrobit,"I mean, Flora could also be Jeff Goldblum, it's definitely fitting in the genderbender theme."
01-09-2018T18:58:36,CrimsonQuill,Kentrosaurus

01-09-2018T18:59:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yeah
01-09-2018T18:59:13,MallardDuckAvia,No Clovis needs to be neddry
01-09-2018T18:59:28,MallardDuckAvia,Or maybe Clovis is Dogson
01-09-2018T18:59:36,CrimsonQuill,ANd get venom in the eyes? No.
01-09-2018T18:59:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"Hope you get Holly‚Äôs situation sorted, Tom"

01-09-2018T19:00:16,Twokinds,I might ask my stepmother if she or anyone she knows can stop in a couple times to check on her
01-09-2018T19:00:24,MallardDuckAvia,Maddie and Mavee am be Lex and Tim
01-09-2018T19:00:29,Twokinds,This curry is really good...
01-09-2018T19:00:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Must be
01-09-2018T19:00:41,unsteddyphoenix,healing curry
01-09-2018T19:00:44,Dadrobit,Golden Curry is a good time.
01-09-2018T19:00:46,SpazztasticKiwi,You haven‚Äôt said anything for the past ten minutes
01-09-2018T19:00:46,MallardDuckAvia,Who would Kat be?
01-09-2018T19:00:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,The blood sucking lawyer
01-09-2018T19:01:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Yea nearby relatives!
01-09-2018T19:01:28,MallardDuckAvia,Kat could be Sarah Harding from the lost world
01-09-2018T19:01:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,we don't talk about lost world
01-09-2018T19:02:03,MallardDuckAvia,It‚Äôs better if you read the book
01-09-2018T19:02:15,MallardDuckAvia,It‚Äôs Jurassic Park 3 we don‚Äôt talk about
01-09-2018T19:02:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,3 was more enjoyable then 2 imo
01-09-2018T19:02:42,MallardDuckAvia,No JP3 was terrible
01-09-2018T19:02:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,and thats coming from a die hard Goldblum fan
01-09-2018T19:03:06,Dadrobit,I actually liked Lost World as a kid.
01-09-2018T19:03:13,MallardDuckAvia,I only enjoyed it because Spinosaurus and Ceratasaurus showed up
01-09-2018T19:03:31,Dadrobit,Dunno how I'd feel about it now as an adult-like individual.
01-09-2018T19:03:35,MallardDuckAvia,The List World is third best and Fallen Kingsom is second
01-09-2018T19:03:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,It does not hold up dad
01-09-2018T19:04:18,MallardDuckAvia,I just think the movie could be more diverse in its dinosaurs
01-09-2018T19:04:37,MallardDuckAvia,Carnotaurus and Baryonyx made Fallen Kingdom great
01-09-2018T19:04:52,MallardDuckAvia,I just wish Allosaurus made more of an appearance
01-09-2018T19:05:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Blue doing air combos to EndoRaptor made it great for me
01-09-2018T19:05:07,MallardDuckAvia,I want to see the Dilophasaurus again too
01-09-2018T19:05:16,MallardDuckAvia,And Spino
01-09-2018T19:05:27,MallardDuckAvia,To bad Sorna is gone too
01-09-2018T19:05:51,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds Which is your favourite Jurassic Park film?
01-09-2018T19:06:19,MallardDuckAvia,The first one is great
01-09-2018T19:07:00,PalmettoPathfinder1,Maybe one day Michael Bay will do a Jurassic Park movie.
01-09-2018T19:07:12,CrimsonQuill,DEAR GOD NO.
01-09-2018T19:07:34,MallardDuckAvia,The next one is the last one
01-09-2018T19:07:44,PalmettoPathfinder1,Oh come on.  He can't make dinosaurs explode.
01-09-2018T19:07:51,PalmettoPathfinder1,Can he?
01-09-2018T19:07:54,Dadrobit,I want to see the Lord of the Rings done by Guillermo del Toro
01-09-2018T19:07:56,MallardDuckAvia,But we don‚Äôt want that
01-09-2018T19:08:05,MallardDuckAvia,We like the dinosaurs
01-09-2018T19:08:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Guillermo del Toro wants to do a R rated star trek
01-09-2018T19:08:13,Dadrobit,What a fucking trip that would be
01-09-2018T19:08:18,CrimsonQuill,Michael Bay will make ANYTHING explode.
01-09-2018T19:08:26,Dadrobit,Really? Is that a thing that could even happen?
01-09-2018T19:08:27,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Like I said, Michael Bay couldn't make the dinosaurs blow up."
01-09-2018T19:08:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"wait, no I'm thinking of Quentin Tarantino"
01-09-2018T19:08:58,CrimsonQuill,"He's like Discworld's Bloody Stupid Johnson-he'd make a mixture of Sand and Water explode,"
01-09-2018T19:09:07,unsteddyphoenix,lmao I love tarantino
01-09-2018T19:09:08,Dadrobit,"Ahhhh, was gonna say."
01-09-2018T19:09:34,Dadrobit,del Toro on a Star Trek would be... Weird.
01-09-2018T19:09:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Guillermo del Toro was playing with a idea for doing a Godzilla movie tho
01-09-2018T19:09:44,MallardDuckAvia,Could someone do the Jurassic Park Sketch suggestion next week for me because I can‚Äôt because I‚Äôm broke?
01-09-2018T19:10:09,PalmettoPathfinder1,I'll see what I can do.
01-09-2018T19:10:16,MallardDuckAvia,Thank you
01-09-2018T19:10:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,still need to get a firefly suggestion in some how
01-09-2018T19:10:31,PalmettoPathfinder1,It'll be Natani riding a raptor though if that's okay.  And you're wlecome!
01-09-2018T19:10:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,for Serp
01-09-2018T19:10:42,FennexTheFox,I made Mac and cheese!
01-09-2018T19:10:44,Dadrobit,Are there gonna be more underwater sex scenes? I need to know this BEFORE going to see it with grandma. The Shape of Water has scarred me from those scenes.
01-09-2018T19:10:48,MallardDuckAvia,And Kat riding an Allosaurus
01-09-2018T19:10:57,PalmettoPathfinder1,Okay.
01-09-2018T19:11:03,MallardDuckAvia,Thank you
01-09-2018T19:11:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Kat riding a T-rex was one of my suggestions a while ago
01-09-2018T19:11:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
01-09-2018T19:11:21,Dadrobit,That and the racist old people laughing at all of the racial slurs.
01-09-2018T19:11:22,CrimsonQuill,I'm standing by my suggestion.
01-09-2018T19:11:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,didn't work out
01-09-2018T19:11:38,CrimsonQuill,None of my sketch suggestions have made it yet...
01-09-2018T19:11:48,MallardDuckAvia,Natani in the sketch will increase the chance though
01-09-2018T19:11:57,FennexTheFox,I'm also making garlic parmesan chicken. *Gives a bite to the whole chat*
01-09-2018T19:11:58,Dadrobit,You need more determination Crimson.
01-09-2018T19:11:58,MallardDuckAvia,Everyone seems to love Nat
01-09-2018T19:12:09,CrimsonQuill,I just want to see Raine as a Halo Spartan.
01-09-2018T19:12:20,CrimsonQuill,Preferably on UNSC Infinity CIC
01-09-2018T19:12:22,FennexTheFox,"Crimson just make suggestions that involve boobs, Raine, and Natani"
01-09-2018T19:12:25,FennexTheFox,Easy
01-09-2018T19:12:32,CrimsonQuill,No boobs
01-09-2018T19:12:47,CrimsonQuill,I might try UNSC AI Flora again later.
01-09-2018T19:12:52,Dadrobit,No boobs? Then it's just a Spartan.
01-09-2018T19:12:59,CrimsonQuill,Yep
01-09-2018T19:13:03,CrimsonQuill,Spartans never die
01-09-2018T19:13:04,Dadrobit,At least with boobs it'd be Master Chief with boobs.
01-09-2018T19:13:08,MallardDuckAvia,I‚Äôve gotta go. Thanks Palmetto
01-09-2018T19:13:09,CrimsonQuill,NO.
01-09-2018T19:13:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
01-09-2018T19:13:16,CrimsonQuill,NOT CHIEF.
01-09-2018T19:13:24,PalmettoPathfinder1,Let's have Michael Bay do a Mega Man movie or a live action version of the Lion King and Aladdin.
01-09-2018T19:13:31,CrimsonQuill,There is a Spartan in Reach named Kat...
01-09-2018T19:13:34,PalmettoPathfinder1,You're welcome!!
01-09-2018T19:13:38,Dadrobit,You have severely harmed your chances at winning. I was almost going to vote for that.
01-09-2018T19:13:44,CrimsonQuill,Me?
01-09-2018T19:13:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,she got shoot in the dome if I remember
01-09-2018T19:13:56,PalmettoPathfinder1,Hey let's have Michael Bay do a Halo movie!
01-09-2018T19:13:57,CrimsonQuill,@Dadrobit Me?
01-09-2018T19:14:03,CrimsonQuill,As in voting?
01-09-2018T19:14:08,Dadrobit,"Aye, I'd vote for Master Chief with boobs."
01-09-2018T19:14:09,CrimsonQuill,what's going on?
01-09-2018T19:14:17,CrimsonQuill,Oh no.
01-09-2018T19:14:22,FennexTheFox,Oh yes.
01-09-2018T19:14:29,CrimsonQuill,i'm sticking with Spartan Raine.
01-09-2018T19:14:42,Dadrobit,"Otherwise, fuck it, I'm not gonna waste Tom's time for a sketch of something that I can find in higher quality literally everywhere else."
01-09-2018T19:14:43,PalmettoPathfinder1,Maybe an Arbiter Natani too?
01-09-2018T19:14:49,CrimsonQuill,Chief has enough on his plate what with Cortana going bad
01-09-2018T19:14:50,Dadrobit,on*
01-09-2018T19:15:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Arbiter with boobs, getting freaky now"
01-09-2018T19:15:05,PalmettoPathfinder1,I'll still vote for it Crimson
01-09-2018T19:15:09,CrimsonQuill,Thanks
01-09-2018T19:15:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,oh god
01-09-2018T19:15:17,PalmettoPathfinder1,Np
01-09-2018T19:15:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Keith david with boobs
01-09-2018T19:15:22,CrimsonQuill,I just love Halo
01-09-2018T19:15:33,CrimsonQuill,I also have an idea of Jedi vs Sith Trace
01-09-2018T19:15:40,Dadrobit,"I want that, Marv."
01-09-2018T19:15:41,CrimsonQuill,But that's for later
01-09-2018T19:15:45,Dadrobit,I want that desperately.
01-09-2018T19:15:45,CrimsonQuill,Not this week
01-09-2018T19:15:47,PalmettoPathfinder1,Michael Bay doing a Halo movie?  Good? Bad? Or why would you even want that!?
01-09-2018T19:16:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I do too, but the idea of it also scares me dad"
01-09-2018T19:16:32,CrimsonQuill,I'd give a Halo movie to James Cameron or Peter Jackson.
01-09-2018T19:16:50,Dadrobit,"Don't want that. In general Video Game movies suck, but a Halo movie would be a crap movie that would be made solely for it to have a ""cliffhanger"" ending to sell Halo Sequels."
01-09-2018T19:17:17,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Hey here's a suggestion, Tom telling the TK cast that he's turning over directing of TwoKinds to Michael Bay and Tom draws his characters' reactions (just their faces, not their whole bodies)."
01-09-2018T19:17:26,CrimsonQuill,Ummmm....
01-09-2018T19:17:35,CrimsonQuill,"Tea, anyone/"
01-09-2018T19:17:40,CrimsonQuill,?
01-09-2018T19:18:02,PalmettoPathfinder1,Michael Bay doesn't cause everything he touches to blow up!  Why does everyone think that!?
01-09-2018T19:19:25,Bgrmystr2,Have you watched.. any of his movies?
01-09-2018T19:19:28,Bgrmystr2,at all?
01-09-2018T19:20:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Armageddon was a lot of fun
01-09-2018T19:20:50,CrimsonQuill,I just don't like his style.
01-09-2018T19:21:20,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, the guy knows how to make action scenes actiony, but he puts explosions in places where they wouldn't actually happen"
01-09-2018T19:21:29,Bgrmystr2,and it draws away from the believability
01-09-2018T19:21:30,BadFoMo,Lets let Uwe Boll do the Halo move!
01-09-2018T19:21:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,uuuuuugh
01-09-2018T19:21:54,CrimsonQuill,Let's just wait for Halo Infinite first.
01-09-2018T19:22:03,CrimsonQuill,And the TV series that's been announced.
01-09-2018T19:22:06,PalmettoPathfinder1,I have!  They're great movies!
01-09-2018T19:22:24,Bgrmystr2,"I'll just let Halo stay as a game, and not give the chance of someone ruining the game's name to make a buck"
01-09-2018T19:22:27,Bgrmystr2,that's just me
01-09-2018T19:22:28,BadFoMo,Halo TV show?
01-09-2018T19:22:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,the fall of reach I think
01-09-2018T19:22:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,on netflix
01-09-2018T19:23:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,nope thats a animated movie
01-09-2018T19:23:12,CrimsonQuill,"No, this is a Master Chief centered story."
01-09-2018T19:23:35,CrimsonQuill,It'll be after Cortana's 'episode'...
01-09-2018T19:23:52,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, the lore of the games stopped being canon after 3"
01-09-2018T19:23:55,Bgrmystr2,imo
01-09-2018T19:23:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,same bgr
01-09-2018T19:24:09,CrimsonQuill,I actually loved number 4.
01-09-2018T19:24:14,Dadrobit,:/ Only ever played the first one honestly.
01-09-2018T19:24:22,CrimsonQuill,"It was the first I bought, and my personal favourite."
01-09-2018T19:24:33,Dadrobit,Had a lot of fun 1v1 my older brother on blood gulch.
01-09-2018T19:24:35,Bgrmystr2,"cuz after that, Microsoft is just trying to make money off the franchise, not actually give the players a good game"
01-09-2018T19:24:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"2 and 3 are amazing dad, reach and odst are a lot of fun too"
01-09-2018T19:24:38,unsteddyphoenix,same dad
01-09-2018T19:24:53,unsteddyphoenix,Just played with friends at sleepovers a bunch
01-09-2018T19:24:55,Bgrmystr2,"1 is my favorite, and I've played many hours of every game."
01-09-2018T19:24:55,CrimsonQuill,I have Halo Reach and Halo 4.
01-09-2018T19:25:09,Bgrmystr2,"then you're missing out on the good ones, Crimson :P"
01-09-2018T19:25:17,CrimsonQuill,4 is my favourite-I've beaten Legendary twice.
01-09-2018T19:25:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I debate whether I should go to bed early
01-09-2018T19:25:29,CrimsonQuill,"I want to play 2 and 3 though,"
01-09-2018T19:25:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,what time is it for you Kiwi?
01-09-2018T19:25:37,Dadrobit,Can't play ODST. Even if I had it. Knowing how it ends kind of killed any aspirations I had towards that end.
01-09-2018T19:25:54,SpazztasticKiwi,...7:25
01-09-2018T19:26:03,CrimsonQuill,@SpazztasticKiwi I should be asleep. It's 1:25 am
01-09-2018T19:26:07,Bgrmystr2,"you gonna ignore the first game, Quill? Cuz the anniversary edition exists for a reason."
01-09-2018T19:26:11,MallardDuckAvia,I‚Äôm trying Couscous tonight
01-09-2018T19:26:12,CrimsonQuill,No.
01-09-2018T19:26:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm tired all the time
01-09-2018T19:26:18,CrimsonQuill,I want to play no.1
01-09-2018T19:26:32,CrimsonQuill,I just haven't found it in Entertainment exchange yet
01-09-2018T19:26:38,TorqueEmUp,"I've personally enjoyed all the Halo games. (Minus Halo Wars, and the Spartan games)"
01-09-2018T19:26:46,MarshallMelon,Well the MCC just got a massive overhaul and is free on Game Pass so it might be worth checking out
01-09-2018T19:27:09,CrimsonQuill,Cortana: 'Just one Question-what if you Miss?'
01-09-2018T19:27:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,all of them are fun but the story fell flat for me on 4
01-09-2018T19:27:18,CrimsonQuill,Chief: 'I won't'.
01-09-2018T19:27:26,CrimsonQuill,Epitome of Badassery.
01-09-2018T19:27:30,TorqueEmUp,"But the newer ones still started feeling a little more hallow. Could be just people want something diffrent, it's not the mid 2000s anymore, so we are just sick of the Halo formula."
01-09-2018T19:27:43,CrimsonQuill,I like it a lot.
01-09-2018T19:27:53,MarshallMelon,4 requires more familiarity with the books. But it's probably the best story-wise. 5 is terrible.
01-09-2018T19:28:06,CrimsonQuill,I agree that 5 wasn't so good.
01-09-2018T19:28:14,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, I remember like nothing from 5. :P"
01-09-2018T19:28:16,MarshallMelon,"Terrible story, anyway. Gameplay is the series peak so far."
01-09-2018T19:28:20,Bgrmystr2,I don't think the books were ever canonical to the game lore anyway
01-09-2018T19:28:26,TorqueEmUp,then again I remember very little from 4.
01-09-2018T19:28:38,MarshallMelon,"4 kinda retroactively added them to the canon, Bgr"
01-09-2018T19:28:55,Bgrmystr2,"then it's not a legitimate canon, cuz the original bungie team didn't do it"
01-09-2018T19:28:57,CrimsonQuill,4 is my favourite for now.
01-09-2018T19:29:01,Bgrmystr2,so big nope from me
01-09-2018T19:29:12,CrimsonQuill,I give 343 a chance
01-09-2018T19:29:13,TorqueEmUp,Well so did Reach in a way. It acknowledged that the books existed.
01-09-2018T19:29:22,Bgrmystr2,"and that's not to say the books are bad, cuz I've got one of em"
01-09-2018T19:29:24,TorqueEmUp,Fall of Reach and all that
01-09-2018T19:29:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I read some of the books, don't remember 4 mentioning any of them."
01-09-2018T19:29:49,CrimsonQuill,Imagine a fireteam of the Twokinds cast-maybe Trace as an ODST!
01-09-2018T19:29:53,TorqueEmUp,"Fall of Reach was a good one. Give The Flood a pass, it's just a novelization of Halo 1."
01-09-2018T19:30:01,MarshallMelon,"It's mostly regarding the Forerunners, particularly the Didact/Librarian"
01-09-2018T19:30:08,MarshallMelon,Primordium's a big one
01-09-2018T19:30:24,CrimsonQuill,Haven't read any books-I got most of my info from Halopedia and the Mythos book in the bookshop
01-09-2018T19:30:54,Bgrmystr2,The only thing I really consider part of lore non-game wise was the book that bungie released that told how Johnson got away.
01-09-2018T19:31:26,Bgrmystr2,cuz it was never explained in the games
01-09-2018T19:31:44,MarshallMelon,"First Strike, right?"
01-09-2018T19:31:57,Bgrmystr2,no
01-09-2018T19:32:03,Bgrmystr2,it wasn't long
01-09-2018T19:32:17,Dadrobit,"Only book I've ever read from a game was ""Templar One"" from EVE Online. Actually surprisingly good. Stands up well as a hard core sci fi novel on its own."
01-09-2018T19:32:24,MarshallMelon,"That was the one that had Johnson picked up by Chief, so you might be mistaken"
01-09-2018T19:32:36,Bgrmystr2,"I'm not mistaken, I have the hardback"
01-09-2018T19:32:51,CrimsonQuill,I really like Johnson as a character.
01-09-2018T19:33:02,MarshallMelon,"Imma just drop this link on you then, buddy"
01-09-2018T19:33:04,MarshallMelon,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo:_First_Strike
01-09-2018T19:33:38,Bgrmystr2,"Like I said, it wasn't that."
01-09-2018T19:33:44,Bgrmystr2,there's a different book
01-09-2018T19:33:53,Bgrmystr2,"it's not a long book, like that is"
01-09-2018T19:33:55,Twokinds,I don't feel so good
01-09-2018T19:33:57,Bgrmystr2,and it's a comic
01-09-2018T19:34:11,unsteddyphoenix,"""Mr. Stark"""
01-09-2018T19:34:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Did you eat too fast
01-09-2018T19:34:18,Bgrmystr2,aw tom :/
01-09-2018T19:34:21,Twokinds,So much curry...
01-09-2018T19:34:34,Dadrobit,All the curry
01-09-2018T19:34:36,TorqueEmUp,oof
01-09-2018T19:34:36,unsteddyphoenix,It's hard to feel sympathetic
01-09-2018T19:34:44,unsteddyphoenix,"""I ate too much good food :("
01-09-2018T19:34:48,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs this new thing called chewing. You should try it
01-09-2018T19:34:54,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds Are you going to be alright&gt;
01-09-2018T19:34:56,CrimsonQuill,?
01-09-2018T19:34:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,savor the flavor
01-09-2018T19:35:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Tums
01-09-2018T19:36:07,Bgrmystr2,@MarshallMelon This is it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Halo_Graphic_Novel
01-09-2018T19:36:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,altoids help settle stomachs as well
01-09-2018T19:36:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Invest in it
01-09-2018T19:36:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Nap time approaching?
01-09-2018T19:37:02,MarshallMelon,"Ah yeah, that retreaded some of the stuff from older books. First Strike came first though"
01-09-2018T19:37:12,MarshallMelon,My mistake
01-09-2018T19:37:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though at 8 pm, it‚Äôd be more like bedtime"
01-09-2018T19:37:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,A nap sounds good
01-09-2018T19:37:49,Bgrmystr2,"First Strike might be the book I have, but I'm not entirely sure"
01-09-2018T19:37:58,Bgrmystr2,I'd have to find it in my sea of boxes...
01-09-2018T19:38:07,Bgrmystr2,cuz I know I have a novel
01-09-2018T19:38:09,Bgrmystr2,but dunno which one it is
01-09-2018T19:38:19,Bgrmystr2,there's like 4 or 5 or 7
01-09-2018T19:38:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"Marv, how‚Äôd the car work go Thursday?"
01-09-2018T19:38:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"It went good, got it in a state that we can drive around for a bit."
01-09-2018T19:38:58,Twokinds,Wow I am really out of step today
01-09-2018T19:39:05,Twokinds,I forgot to post the art to dA
01-09-2018T19:39:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Vroom vroom
01-09-2018T19:39:14,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds don't worry about it.
01-09-2018T19:39:21,unsteddyphoenix,its a compounding effect
01-09-2018T19:39:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Aren‚Äôt you too young to be having memory problems
01-09-2018T19:39:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"more like click clack click, a few cylinders aren't firing just yet XD"
01-09-2018T19:40:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Better than the lady I was parked next to Friday during lunch
01-09-2018T19:40:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Keep started smoking
01-09-2018T19:40:21,SpazztasticKiwi,*Jeep
01-09-2018T19:40:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,was the smoke blue?
01-09-2018T19:40:41,SpazztasticKiwi,White. Antifreeze leak
01-09-2018T19:40:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,oofy
01-09-2018T19:40:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Smelled funny
01-09-2018T19:41:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,time for a new block it looks
01-09-2018T19:41:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I didn‚Äôt smell anything - another customer walked by with his granddaughter and said the car was smelling like antifreeze
01-09-2018T19:41:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Lady turned off the engine and puff puff puff
01-09-2018T19:42:32,Twokinds,wow the da post broke
01-09-2018T19:42:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,she might a crack in between the cylinder and the cooling channels.  more a leak out side the block hitting something hot
01-09-2018T19:43:08,unsteddyphoenix,broke?
01-09-2018T19:43:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,and how did DA break?

01-09-2018T19:47:23,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/xaMJ6Ef.jpg S'gonna be sweet to have a place that isn't just a driveway covered in tools to work with.

01-09-2018T19:47:47,Dadrobit,wb

01-09-2018T19:48:16,MallardDuckAvia,Did I miss anything of interest?
01-09-2018T19:48:17,Dadrobit,Thank you. Made it a few years back.
01-09-2018T19:48:24,MallardDuckAvia,I‚Äôm going to go again soon
01-09-2018T19:48:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Gonna paint it? I recommend ‚Äúhi Google maps‚Äù
01-09-2018T19:49:01,Dadrobit,"Nah, no paint."
01-09-2018T19:49:13,CrimsonQuill,"@MallardDuckAvia A heated Halo discussion, a whole load of references, and a broken Deviantart page."
01-09-2018T19:49:29,Dadrobit,It's just gonna stay like it is.
01-09-2018T19:50:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Blends in better as is. I was making a fun
01-09-2018T19:51:21,Dadrobit,"Yeah, looks a lot better than what was there. Old wood was thin crappy stuff, looked like the planks were ripped off of a couple shoddy forklift pallets."
01-09-2018T19:51:30,Bgrmystr2,"that halo discussion wasn't even remotely headed, Quill"
01-09-2018T19:51:38,Bgrmystr2,nor was it heated
01-09-2018T19:51:48,Dadrobit,And it was knocked over in one area where a drunk driver slammed one of our cars through it at 2am.
01-09-2018T19:51:57,MarshallMelon,"Wait, how was it heated? It wasn't even hostile."
01-09-2018T19:52:09,MarshallMelon,I mean if I came off that way I apologise

01-09-2018T19:56:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,5 cents closer to that nora burrito
01-09-2018T19:56:03,thestooge,I take it your keeping tallys on who asks that?
01-09-2018T19:56:12,MarshallMelon,"Tom's not feeling good, Stooge. So soon-ish. Next few days."
01-09-2018T19:56:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to guess we‚Äôre about $1-$2 in
01-09-2018T19:56:20,Dadrobit,Nailed it
01-09-2018T19:56:30,SpazztasticKiwi,üî®
01-09-2018T19:56:36,Bgrmystr2,"hm.. I dunno if that far, Kiwi, but yeah pretty close"

01-09-2018T19:56:44,thestooge,"Ah, he mentioned dizziness, hope he feels better"
01-09-2018T19:57:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"Yeah, has that gone away at least"
01-09-2018T19:57:01,Bgrmystr2,I think we're like.. $0.80?
01-09-2018T19:57:03,Bgrmystr2,maybe 90
01-09-2018T19:57:17,Bgrmystr2,give or take one or two
01-09-2018T20:07:22,RimaDraws,heyo

01-09-2018T20:12:05,Twokinds,eeeuuugh
01-09-2018T20:12:09,CrimsonQuill,It's 2:10 in the morning. I've been following this since 9:00pm
01-09-2018T20:12:17,CrimsonQuill,I know how you feel Tom.

01-09-2018T20:12:53,RimaDraws,tom you ok?
01-09-2018T20:13:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Mine has disappeared
01-09-2018T20:13:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Dad, Infintedge is stealing your trademark phrase"
01-09-2018T20:14:06,PalmettoPathfinder1,@RimaDraws his hand started hurting during the stream so he had to take a raincheck.
01-09-2018T20:14:26,RimaDraws,tendinitis probably
01-09-2018T20:14:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"Arms weak, palms were sweating..."
01-09-2018T20:14:41,RimaDraws,my friend has that when he draws
01-09-2018T20:15:06,Bgrmystr2,"Hmm, well he didn't say that, Palm. Seems more like art block."
01-09-2018T20:15:19,Bgrmystr2,but I dunno :u
01-09-2018T20:15:31,RimaDraws,i mean art block happens i get it alot
01-09-2018T20:15:54,RimaDraws,my motivation was shit a couple months but then i have been feeling better
01-09-2018T20:16:17,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, that's what I was interpreting when he said that his hand was being stupid.  Figured it might because his hand started hurting or he had an art block, but his hand has started hurting while he was drawing before."
01-09-2018T20:16:33,Bgrmystr2,yeah after drawing for a long while lol
01-09-2018T20:16:39,Bgrmystr2,the stream had just started kik
01-09-2018T20:16:41,RimaDraws,carpel tunnel and tendinitis happen that way
01-09-2018T20:16:41,Bgrmystr2,lol*
01-09-2018T20:16:50,RimaDraws,you're supposed to do stretches everyso often
01-09-2018T20:17:30,CrimsonQuill,"@Twokinds Goodnight, Tom. Sleep well. I hope you'll be back up and running soon."
01-09-2018T20:17:38,CrimsonQuill,Goodnight all.
01-09-2018T20:17:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Invest in stress ball and flex every ten minutes?
01-09-2018T20:17:50,CrimsonQuill,Or rather...good morning. Sleep well.
01-09-2018T20:18:17,RimaDraws,yea you're supposed to take breaks
01-09-2018T20:18:32,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Yeah, eventually it will happen even after drawing for a few minutes.  Eventually some people lose the ability to draw.  Well, there's surgery but it's expensive."
01-09-2018T20:18:45,PalmettoPathfinder1,So you better take breaks and relax.
01-09-2018T20:19:05,PalmettoPathfinder1,And don't strain yourself.
01-09-2018T20:19:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,bbl
01-09-2018T20:19:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom, get squishy orbeez ball. Squish is fun"
01-09-2018T20:19:29,PalmettoPathfinder1,"If you have to cut a stream short to rest, hey we understand."
01-09-2018T20:19:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Arthritis is not
01-09-2018T20:20:53,RimaDraws,yea arthritis runs in my family and it runs in our hands
01-09-2018T20:20:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm gonna finish up this video and try to use the sleep
01-09-2018T20:21:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"Arthritis, carpal tunnel, all the good stuff"
01-09-2018T20:22:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you don‚Äôt watch it, you‚Äôll lose the ability to draw anything. Or even use your hands"
01-09-2018T20:22:05,PalmettoPathfinder1,Same here.  Goodnight everyone!  Enjoyed talking with y'all!  Tom enjoyed the short stream today!  I hope your hand gets better!
01-09-2018T20:22:19,PalmettoPathfinder1,You could also teach yourself to draw with your feet or mouth.
01-09-2018T20:22:55,PalmettoPathfinder1,The guy who does the Crimson Flag webcomic taught himself to draw with his mouth while he had surgery on both of his hands.
01-09-2018T20:23:45,Dadrobit,Back.
01-09-2018T20:24:04,Dadrobit,"Also, what? Infinite is stealing my phases?!?!?"
01-09-2018T20:24:36,Dadrobit,That rat fink! I thought we were friends! We went to Comic Con together! We got Quesadillas together!!!
01-09-2018T20:26:23,RimaDraws,quesadillas sound so good
01-09-2018T20:26:31,RimaDraws,i had coconut cream pie for dessert
01-09-2018T20:26:57,Bgrmystr2,"wait who the what, dadro?"
01-09-2018T20:29:43,MallardDuckAvia,I‚Äôm back
01-09-2018T20:30:04,Dadrobit,"Yeah, there were some food trucks, and one sold Mexican food. So we got quesadillas. I got an ""Ultimate Quesadilla"" which was like, a quesadilla with ~everything~ on it. Was a god time."
01-09-2018T20:30:11,Dadrobit,good*
01-09-2018T20:30:40,Dadrobit,"JohnnyFox was there with us as well, but I honestly haven't talked with him in like a year."
01-09-2018T20:31:10,Dadrobit,wb Mall
01-09-2018T20:32:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Dad, infinite stole your #qualitySuggestions phrase"
01-09-2018T20:32:10,Dadrobit,But we had a good time overall buying some outrageously expensive figurines.
01-09-2018T20:32:12,MallardDuckAvia,Anything I missed?
01-09-2018T20:32:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,also I'm back

01-09-2018T20:32:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,His and W0lfs discord
01-09-2018T20:32:57,Dadrobit,"I saw him using ""Harder Papi"" on his twitter and thought maybe that was it."
01-09-2018T20:33:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,No the harder papi is because he hit my oc with bread XD
01-09-2018T20:33:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,over jojo stickers
01-09-2018T20:33:42,Dadrobit,"Hm, I really should hit him up for another trip to Comic Con. Was fun hanging with internet peoples."
01-09-2018T20:34:36,MallardDuckAvia,I‚Äôm going to draw some Dinosaurs to post on my DA
01-09-2018T20:34:46,MallardDuckAvia,Any Suggestions?
01-09-2018T20:34:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Would be cool to see some of you guys, but lack of money and living north of the wall makes it hard ;-;"
01-09-2018T20:34:59,Dadrobit,:(
01-09-2018T20:36:32,MallardDuckAvia,Are you still here Palmatto?
01-09-2018T20:36:56,Dadrobit,"Man, haven't gotten on Discord in a while. Not a part of that chat methinks."
01-09-2018T20:37:09,Dadrobit,Am part of one that I'm not sure how or why I got into though.
01-09-2018T20:37:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,zugzug?
01-09-2018T20:37:30,Dadrobit,"Everyone here is ""lil' so-and-so"" While I'm still ""Big Daddy"""
01-09-2018T20:37:35,Dadrobit,Yepper
01-09-2018T20:37:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Thats my server XD
01-09-2018T20:37:47,Dadrobit,That makes sense.
01-09-2018T20:38:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yeah finally landed on a name for that hell hole
01-09-2018T20:38:11,MallardDuckAvia,Should I draw Eustreptospondylus or Baryonyx or Neovenator?
01-09-2018T20:39:02,Dadrobit,"Bruh, just drawing those names is a workout."
01-09-2018T20:39:21,MallardDuckAvia,Ok
01-09-2018T20:39:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,suchomimus
01-09-2018T20:39:39,Dadrobit,"Like, I speak for a living, and I'd straight up turn down money if I had to pronounce those."
01-09-2018T20:40:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"as a dino nerd I can pronounce most of those, spelling them on the other hand.  I would have better luck summoning Cthulhu"
01-09-2018T20:42:03,Bgrmystr2,xD ahh marv
01-09-2018T20:42:09,Bgrmystr2,never change

01-09-2018T20:42:19,Dadrobit,Do people still talk at all in these chats?
01-09-2018T20:42:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I do know it‚Äôd be more likely to go to that Atlanta con though
01-09-2018T20:43:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"ZugZug has voice almost every if not every other night dad, its died down when collage got back tho"
01-09-2018T20:43:11,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôd be nice to find a con and plan to go so we can see each other
01-09-2018T20:43:32,Bgrmystr2,is that where you hang out marv?
01-09-2018T20:44:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I hang mostly in Edges and W0lfs server, I just keep zugzug cleane"
01-09-2018T20:44:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,clean even
01-09-2018T20:44:10,Dadrobit,"PHXCC is pretty cool. We even stop active shooters before they start. Dos suck with the whole ""prop weapon ban"" thing."
01-09-2018T20:44:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Serp come quick
01-09-2018T20:44:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"Phoenix, though? I dunno"

01-09-2018T20:45:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"In Cali, I have relatives that could help me if I get stuck there at a con"
01-09-2018T20:45:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,*Shifts into 3rd just leaving the drive way.*
01-09-2018T20:46:11,SpazztasticKiwi,And Atlanta is a literal drive so that‚Äôs safe
01-09-2018T20:46:16,Dadrobit,"And then there I am in long sleeves, vest, and boots carrying a frying pan"
01-09-2018T20:46:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"Well, relatively safe"
01-09-2018T20:46:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"ok, I need to see that dad"
01-09-2018T20:46:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd go to Oktoberfest but that‚Äôs not a con and I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôd find it worth it
01-09-2018T20:47:21,Dadrobit,Do you really?
01-09-2018T20:47:26,Dadrobit,Probably not
01-09-2018T20:47:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Chicken

01-09-2018T20:48:22,Bgrmystr2,I kinda wanna see too
01-09-2018T20:48:30,Dadrobit,If only I had a Rapunzel...
01-09-2018T20:48:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Like the closest I‚Äôve done for cosplay is when I tried gender bend
01-09-2018T20:48:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Unsteddy has the hair for it
01-09-2018T20:49:11,unsteddyphoenix,debatable
01-09-2018T20:49:15,SpazztasticKiwi,But the beard is hell to put up with
01-09-2018T20:49:18,unsteddyphoenix,But for Dad i'd try~
01-09-2018T20:49:21,Dadrobit,&lt;3
01-09-2018T20:52:12,Dadrobit,"Am lucky. I have a super artsy sister who lunged at the chance to help make me a costume. But she had/has her own stall to look after, so she was sad she couldn't just go around showing me off"

01-09-2018T20:55:15,Twokinds,Yes
01-09-2018T20:55:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Cool

01-09-2018T20:56:14,TheBeckoner,"Ever gonna go as the pizza guy, Tom?"
01-09-2018T20:56:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,The need to know more intensifies
01-09-2018T20:56:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Let me guess ‚ÄúI went as myself to SDCC‚Äù
01-09-2018T20:56:54,Twokinds,No
01-09-2018T20:57:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Star Wars related?
01-09-2018T20:57:14,Kinipshun,hey all hows it goin

01-09-2018T20:57:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Niiiice
01-09-2018T20:57:32,unsteddyphoenix,"well, obviously"

01-09-2018T20:57:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I bet you were a very pretty girl
01-09-2018T20:57:44,SpazztasticKiwi,The prettiest of the land
01-09-2018T20:57:48,unsteddyphoenix,HE has the hair for it
01-09-2018T20:57:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Did you win the cosplay contest?
01-09-2018T20:57:57,Kinipshun,so tom cosplayed as power girl
01-09-2018T20:58:05,Kinipshun,neat
01-09-2018T20:58:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Tell me - how was it fitting in the suit
01-09-2018T21:00:47,Dadrobit,A little tight in the..... Everywhere...
01-09-2018T21:01:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Especially if he stuffed the bra right
01-09-2018T21:01:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd die with a chest that big
01-09-2018T21:02:17,RimaDraws,lol
01-09-2018T21:02:39,SpazztasticKiwi,That reminds me - I was talking to a coworker about Natani and she also thought she used chest binders cause she was an Assassin
01-09-2018T21:03:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Then we spent the rest of the night discussing anime
01-09-2018T21:04:46,SpazztasticKiwi,The more I look at Power Girl‚Äôs suit the more uncomfortable it is
01-09-2018T21:10:29,RimaDraws,it looks like it would be
01-09-2018T21:10:58,SpazztasticKiwi,How dose she have support in that thing
01-09-2018T21:11:49,RimaDraws,I dont know
01-09-2018T21:12:17,Twokinds,Well she is a super hero
01-09-2018T21:12:20,InTheLionsDen,Super strength cells that pretty much ignore the tiny effect of earth gravity.
01-09-2018T21:12:24,Twokinds,"So you know, invulnerable skin and all that"
01-09-2018T21:12:45,InTheLionsDen,*Earth
01-09-2018T21:19:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Invulnerable skin doesn‚Äôt mean momentum doesn‚Äôt apply
01-09-2018T21:19:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,super strength to counter act
01-09-2018T21:19:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Or sweating
01-09-2018T21:19:51,SpazztasticKiwi,She‚Äôs pretty. Not a fan of the cape
01-09-2018T21:20:51,RimaDraws,no capes!
01-09-2018T21:20:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Or the boob cut out window. Too many openings for a breezy fly through the city
01-09-2018T21:21:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Edna made a convincing argument about capes and I‚Äôll say - it‚Äôs true
01-09-2018T21:22:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"It raises another question - Tom, you have an interest in DC & Marvel?"
01-09-2018T21:28:03,Twokinds,Not particularly
01-09-2018T21:33:56,Twokinds,I am familiar with Western Comics from movies and media
01-09-2018T21:34:11,Twokinds,Mostly through internet reviewers
01-09-2018T21:34:24,Twokinds,But I never took much of an interest in them as a kid.
01-09-2018T21:37:08,RimaDraws,oooh
01-09-2018T21:42:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Nice
01-09-2018T21:43:08,SpazztasticKiwi,All I know is generally who‚Äôs who and where they‚Äôre from. And some of the actors. That‚Äôs about it
01-09-2018T21:44:43,FennexTheFox,"Tom, what was your first anime? Mine was Pok√©mon"
01-09-2018T21:45:05,Twokinds,The first I remember?
01-09-2018T21:45:12,Twokinds,Probably My Neighbor Totoro
01-09-2018T21:45:19,FennexTheFox,Classic
01-09-2018T21:45:42,FennexTheFox,I actually watched that for the first time a week or so ago.
01-09-2018T21:46:42,Bgrmystr2,I watched that a few years back
01-09-2018T21:46:47,Bgrmystr2,wasn't as good as I expected :/
01-09-2018T21:47:38,RimaDraws,i loved my neighbor totoro
01-09-2018T21:47:53,RimaDraws,mine was sailor moon by the way
01-09-2018T21:48:00,FennexTheFox,"I feel I was outside of the demographic, but I would have loved it as a kid"
01-09-2018T21:48:13,Bgrmystr2,"I'll tell you what was good, The Secret World of Arietty"
01-09-2018T21:48:20,RimaDraws,i have that one too
01-09-2018T21:48:25,RimaDraws,i love it
01-09-2018T21:48:25,Dadrobit,Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind
01-09-2018T21:48:34,Dadrobit,my first that is.
01-09-2018T21:48:41,Bgrmystr2,"don't think I saw that one, dadro"
01-09-2018T21:48:47,RimaDraws,i never saw nausicaa
01-09-2018T21:49:02,Dadrobit,"Was a smol kiddo. It was put under the ""children"" section of the VHS rentals at the library."
01-09-2018T21:49:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Robotech was my first
01-09-2018T21:49:11,Dadrobit,It is not a children's movie.
01-09-2018T21:49:28,Dadrobit,But it is an exceptional movie nonethless.
01-09-2018T21:49:28,Bgrmystr2,I never got into renting VHS. Seemed like a waste of money
01-09-2018T21:49:56,FennexTheFox,"I didn't grow up watching anime ^^; I was never allowed to watch anything above G rated until I was 10 or so, when I got into Pok√©mon"
01-09-2018T21:50:16,Mippy,I think Ghibli is overrated. I think my first anime was Samurai Pizza Cats
01-09-2018T21:50:22,Dadrobit,"It was used sparingly as a treat. Every once in a while when dad took us to the library, we could pester him enough to let us bring home a movie."
01-09-2018T21:50:28,FennexTheFox,Dubbed or subbed mippy? Lol
01-09-2018T21:51:02,Mippy,Dubbed...lol.
01-09-2018T21:51:19,FennexTheFox,"I've heard.. things about that dub, lol"
01-09-2018T21:51:30,Dadrobit,"That movie lasted in my memories. When in high school, I arranged a small quartet for myself and my band buddies to play the main theme. I bet I still have them somewhere..."
01-09-2018T21:52:02,Mippy,I can't remember much of it. I was like...3 years old. I just have vauge memories of it.
01-09-2018T21:53:17,FennexTheFox,Anyone else here grow up with strict parents? I couldn't even watch SpongeBob..
01-09-2018T21:54:15,Mippy,Not really. I mean...they had understandable restrictions on what I watched...like no South Park and stuff...
01-09-2018T21:54:35,Dadrobit,"Yeah, just had this conversation a few weeks back. My father was so against TV, that when 9/11 happened, I got into a fight with his girlfriend about shutting off the TV because it was not allowed in our house."
01-09-2018T21:54:52,FennexTheFox,Wow
01-09-2018T21:54:58,Dadrobit,Much less SpongeBob
01-09-2018T21:55:00,SpazztasticKiwi,My dad didn‚Äôt like tv
01-09-2018T21:55:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Fairy odd parents had magic = bad
01-09-2018T21:55:42,FennexTheFox,I know your pain kiwi
01-09-2018T21:56:00,FennexTheFox,I wasn't allowed to read Harry Potter until 8th grade for that reason.
01-09-2018T21:56:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Rugrats rubbed him the wrong way (kids too young to be talking)
01-09-2018T21:56:09,Mippy,I don't understand why people would even have a TV is they are not going to watch it. Just don't have a TV
01-09-2018T21:56:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Wild Thornberries I don‚Äôt remember if he cared or not
01-09-2018T21:56:26,Dadrobit,"Also, I found the pages. Good times. https://i.imgur.com/R8RY04y.jpg"
01-09-2018T21:56:38,Dadrobit,We had the TV for movies.
01-09-2018T21:56:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I know he didn‚Äôt like Star Wars or Star Trek cause they had aliens
01-09-2018T21:57:07,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs why I‚Äôve never seen them
01-09-2018T21:57:07,Dadrobit,But pops hated and hates regular television.
01-09-2018T21:57:12,FennexTheFox,Weirdly my parents LOVED Star Wars
01-09-2018T21:57:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Mom likes Star Trek
01-09-2018T21:57:29,Mippy,Kiwi were your parents religious whack jobs
01-09-2018T21:57:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Dad was
01-09-2018T21:57:40,FennexTheFox,But they never let me watch it. I grew up on Fox News and Arthur
01-09-2018T21:57:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Bible quoter
01-09-2018T21:57:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt remember much of what I watched
01-09-2018T21:58:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I liked totally spies and wind club and Kim possible
01-09-2018T21:58:20,SpazztasticKiwi,*winx
01-09-2018T21:58:28,FennexTheFox,Also grew up on Rush Limbaugh. That guy's voice still is ingrained in my head *shiver*
01-09-2018T21:59:00,FennexTheFox,My parents would have the radio on that while I played in the living room.
01-09-2018T21:59:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Or however you spell that. They were no mos cause of magic and revealing clothes. My mom and grandparents didn‚Äôt care though so they let me and my sis watch
01-09-2018T21:59:49,Mippy,I think the only kid show I was not allowed to watch was Caillou...and that is compleatly understandable
01-09-2018T22:00:03,SpazztasticKiwi,That one creeped me out
01-09-2018T22:00:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember liked Dora plenty. Sister was so glad when I grew out of it
01-09-2018T22:01:39,FennexTheFox,I always preferred shows with animals or anthros. Seeing the news so much made me hate humans I guess idk
01-09-2018T22:01:49,Mippy,I was a bit old for Dora when it started. ....I think I was like 10
01-09-2018T22:01:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Most of what I know I‚Äôve had to teach myself or learn from watching others and going over to friends‚Äô. I get weird looks about alot cause I didn‚Äôt get to see what all was there
01-09-2018T22:03:02,FennexTheFox,I had one friend whose parents would let us watch PG movies
01-09-2018T22:03:11,Mippy,Anthro/animal shows....I watched a fair few of those. I think the Redwall cartoon helped propel me into furrydom
01-09-2018T22:03:25,FennexTheFox,Arthur did me in
01-09-2018T22:04:09,Mippy,Arthur is a legit good show
01-09-2018T22:04:25,FennexTheFox,I still like it
01-09-2018T22:04:59,FennexTheFox,The computer episodes are hilarious to watch since they were all made in like 2002 or something like that
01-09-2018T22:05:43,Mippy,I catch it when I can. I still remember the day the word aardvark was the only word I got right on a 5th grade spelling text
01-09-2018T22:06:14,FennexTheFox,A-a-rd-VARK
01-09-2018T22:06:59,Mippy,My spelling has improved since then....\
01-09-2018T22:08:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Anime I liked was Inuyasha. One of the first ‚Äúdefinitely not for kids‚Äù thing I watched
01-09-2018T22:09:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Grew fond of howls moving castle too
01-09-2018T22:09:48,Mippy,^ The book was better
01-09-2018T22:10:15,Mippy,"I can't remember if Inuyasha or Akira was my first ""grown up"" anime"
01-09-2018T22:10:41,Dadrobit,"Akira is definitively more ""grown up"" if that matters lol."
01-09-2018T22:10:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Also know it took me a bit to find out Sesshomaru was in fact a guy
01-09-2018T22:10:53,Dadrobit,Inuyasha is just DBZ with swords
01-09-2018T22:11:41,Dadrobit,"(Not that I remember half of it. But I did read the manga like, a decade ago)"
01-09-2018T22:11:58,SpazztasticKiwi,They finally wrapped up the anime
01-09-2018T22:12:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Sesshomaru is still a wet blanket but at least he became civil to his half brother
01-09-2018T22:12:31,Dadrobit,Never watched it. My brother did have an Inuyasha fighting game though.
01-09-2018T22:12:51,FennexTheFox,Heh.. my first grown up anime was death note. I was like 13 and watched it in secret
01-09-2018T22:13:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I never finished DN
01-09-2018T22:13:10,FennexTheFox,It got real shitty
01-09-2018T22:13:31,SpazztasticKiwi,boyfriend spoiled it for me and i just ‚Äúwelp nm now‚Äù
01-09-2018T22:13:33,FennexTheFox,The ending was good though imo
01-09-2018T22:13:42,Mippy,"Well, I was in middle school. I had never actually seen a cartoon with nudity in it before. I may have seen Inuyasha and Akira around the same time. Because of the ""mature subject matter"" I felt like I was watching something I shoulden't have . It was exi"
01-09-2018T22:13:50,Mippy,ting
01-09-2018T22:14:29,SpazztasticKiwi,They got cheeky with the convenient censorship
01-09-2018T22:14:47,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúWater is juuuust high enough to cover the men‚Äù
01-09-2018T22:14:55,Mippy,Oh...Death Note...that fandom was shitty back in the day.
01-09-2018T22:14:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"Sure, animators. Sure"
01-09-2018T22:15:22,RimaDraws,death note that anime is okay but dark
01-09-2018T22:15:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Miroku is like a spitting image of Eric
01-09-2018T22:15:30,RimaDraws,not as dark ive seen but still
01-09-2018T22:15:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Except he‚Äôs not an artist
01-09-2018T22:16:11,Mippy,I must confes...I never liked L and felt nothing when his character was killed off
01-09-2018T22:16:21,SpazztasticKiwi,And Eric doesn‚Äôt have a cursed hole in his hand. And is blond. Basically they‚Äôre both just really thirsty
01-09-2018T22:16:22,Dadrobit,:/ Might watch Akira again tonight. Crazy good anime.
01-09-2018T22:16:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'm gonna marathon some Durara
01-09-2018T22:17:18,Dadrobit,Never watched it.
01-09-2018T22:17:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm gonna go on a hot date with Pillow n Blanket in a bit
01-09-2018T22:17:35,Mippy,"I should probubly rewatch Akira...all I really remember is strange bikes, green ""kids"", and being really confused"
01-09-2018T22:17:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"its about gangs, and supernatural beings. a lot of fun"
01-09-2018T22:17:53,SpazztasticKiwi,If my cat will scoot over
01-09-2018T22:18:28,Mippy,I should probubly get there myself soon Kiwi
01-09-2018T22:19:06,Dadrobit,Watched it a few months ago. It's super good.
01-09-2018T22:19:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I really want to get a queen bed
01-09-2018T22:19:35,SpazztasticKiwi,That way I‚Äôm not playing Tetris to get in bed every night
01-09-2018T22:20:02,Bgrmystr2,"Dadro, did you buy those music sheets?"
01-09-2018T22:20:16,Mippy,I have a queen bed. First thing I got mysself when I got my job. I was sleeping on a matris on the floor before
01-09-2018T22:21:12,Dadrobit,"Nah, I just wrote them in Finale."
01-09-2018T22:21:41,Dadrobit,Listened to the song a million times and plucked it out on the Euphonium
01-09-2018T22:22:55,Dadrobit,Hence why it's arranged for a rather strange ensemble.
01-09-2018T22:23:12,Dadrobit,"2 flutes, a trombone, a euphonium, and a Tuba."
01-09-2018T22:23:18,Dadrobit,Perfect balance.
01-09-2018T22:23:27,Dadrobit,//sarcasm
01-09-2018T22:23:35,Dadrobit,Just myself and my band buddies.
01-09-2018T22:26:52,Bgrmystr2,oh okay
01-09-2018T22:27:10,Bgrmystr2,I thought you purchased music sheets or somethin for the song like..
01-09-2018T22:27:19,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, seemed interesting"
01-09-2018T22:27:37,Bgrmystr2,I'm always on the lookout for stuff I could possibly play if I like the music
01-09-2018T22:29:36,Bgrmystr2,"you have finale because of school or somesuch, yeah?"
01-09-2018T22:30:16,Bgrmystr2,fairly expensive program
01-09-2018T22:31:37,Dadrobit,"Ah, no. I stole the fuck out of it."
01-09-2018T22:33:41,Bgrmystr2,ah okay XD
01-09-2018T22:33:52,Bgrmystr2,"cuz I was gonna say, they want like $600 for this"
01-09-2018T22:34:58,Dadrobit,"Yeah, no. I was like, 15-16. No way I had that kind of money laying around."
01-09-2018T22:36:35,Bgrmystr2,I figured you would have gotten it for free for school or somethin
01-09-2018T22:36:56,Bgrmystr2,they give away stupid expensive programs for free for students apparently
01-09-2018T22:37:01,Bgrmystr2,not that I ever got any
01-09-2018T22:37:03,Combak,So...
01-09-2018T22:37:11,Dadrobit,"Nah, I was public School. Did really well in music, but didn't earn jack shit besides a few trophies and plaques."
01-09-2018T22:37:28,Combak,"Did Tom mention anything about a make up stream, or...?"
01-09-2018T22:37:39,Dadrobit,Another Nickel!!!
01-09-2018T22:37:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,nope
01-09-2018T22:37:44,Bgrmystr2,does that count as another nickel? haha
01-09-2018T22:37:47,Bgrmystr2,I guess so
01-09-2018T22:38:12,Bgrmystr2,"that's what, $0.90? let's go with that"
01-09-2018T22:38:31,Bgrmystr2,pretty sure there was one in between
01-09-2018T22:39:15,Bgrmystr2,"might be one tomorrow, combak"
01-09-2018T22:39:19,Bgrmystr2,we dunno yet
01-09-2018T22:39:26,Bgrmystr2,no plans as of now
01-09-2018T22:39:44,Bgrmystr2,I guess keep an eye out but don't expect anything.
01-09-2018T22:42:48,BadFoMo,There are 5 Sundays this month. This one could just be skipped and we could just have a normal month.
01-09-2018T22:44:36,Combak,... Guessing there's a thing about a nickel for every time someone asks about the stream?
01-09-2018T22:53:53,Dadrobit,You got it
01-09-2018T23:07:40,RimaDraws,hmmmm
01-09-2018T23:15:56,Bgrmystr2,"untrue, Fomo. Tom's going out of country on the 19th"
01-09-2018T23:16:00,SpazztasticKiwi,:ctwokinds-natanisleep:
01-09-2018T23:16:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Later chatters

01-09-2018T23:16:36,Bgrmystr2,"I think we may miss the last few streams of the month, though I dunno when he's getting back"
01-09-2018T23:16:59,Dadrobit,o /Spazz
01-09-2018T23:19:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Nighty night lads, &lt;3"
01-09-2018T23:21:37,Dadrobit,o/ Marv
01-09-2018T23:29:10,Twokinds,Need assistance
01-09-2018T23:31:23,Kinipshun,"here, how can i help you?"
01-09-2018T23:35:18,Twokinds,What do you imagine Trace and Rose's first meeting was like
01-09-2018T23:35:44,Bgrmystr2,you're asking us? xDD
01-09-2018T23:36:24,Bgrmystr2,I don't recall most of rose's backstory honestly..
01-09-2018T23:36:27,Twokinds,Well I honestly had no idea
01-09-2018T23:36:44,Kinipshun,"i'd imagine it was saria bringing her home to shelter her as a ""slave"""
01-09-2018T23:37:06,Kinipshun,(aka we're actually gonna take good care of you here)
01-09-2018T23:37:24,unsteddyphoenix,Didnt rose know OF trace prior to them meeting?
01-09-2018T23:37:24,Kinipshun,(just dont piss off my husband)
01-09-2018T23:37:44,Kinipshun,"yeah youre right, she's probably be hella nervous"
01-09-2018T23:37:55,Kinipshun,*she'd
01-09-2018T23:38:17,Twokinds,Yeah
01-09-2018T23:38:44,Kinipshun,"trace: ""just don't let that thing get in my way"""
01-09-2018T23:39:24,unsteddyphoenix,"""Oh you got a pet? Thought you didnt like slaves"""
01-09-2018T23:39:30,Bgrmystr2,haha
01-09-2018T23:39:55,Bgrmystr2,Would it have been after she was freed from slavery by Saria?
01-09-2018T23:39:56,Kinipshun,"what if saria was keeping rose secret to keep her safe from trace, but trace found her, and only let rose keep her under the condition that she was kept as a slave?"
01-09-2018T23:40:20,Bgrmystr2,"after the Dragon Masquerade, probably"
01-09-2018T23:40:33,Kinipshun,yeah that's what i was thinking too
01-09-2018T23:41:09,Bgrmystr2,hmm maybe I dunno? Saria was super adamant about keidran not being slaves or whatever
01-09-2018T23:41:13,Bgrmystr2,;u
01-09-2018T23:41:21,Bgrmystr2,not sure if she'd go for that
01-09-2018T23:41:38,Kinipshun,but maybe she knew how to bend trace's wishes and mae a technicality?
01-09-2018T23:41:51,Bgrmystr2,I'd kind of expect it to be a repeat of the first time trace brought a slave into their house lol
01-09-2018T23:42:00,Kinipshun,"and just treated her the same way kat was eric's ""slave"""
01-09-2018T23:42:21,Twokinds,Trace was just a kid when Rose and Saria met
01-09-2018T23:42:32,Twokinds,Saria was much older than Trace
01-09-2018T23:43:29,Twokinds,So Rose and Saria would have already been living together for a while by the time she started dating Trace.
01-09-2018T23:43:36,Bgrmystr2,yeah so it had to have been after all the stuff we know of
01-09-2018T23:43:43,unsteddyphoenix,Huh. How much older? Rose is only a couple yeara older than trace isnt she
01-09-2018T23:43:55,Kinipshun,so yeah i'd imagine saria was keeping rose secret from trace
01-09-2018T23:43:58,Twokinds,"Remember, when Rose was being hanged, Trace was there"
01-09-2018T23:44:01,Twokinds,He was a little kid
01-09-2018T23:44:42,unsteddyphoenix,Oh what if trace talked to her at yhat time?
01-09-2018T23:45:01,unsteddyphoenix,Darker twist~
01-09-2018T23:45:12,Bgrmystr2,Was he? I don't even remember that
01-09-2018T23:45:29,unsteddyphoenix,I member
01-09-2018T23:45:34,Kinipshun,maybe... trace first discovers rose when he walks in on rose helping saria get dressed or with housechores something
01-09-2018T23:45:48,Kinipshun,*or something
01-09-2018T23:46:59,unsteddyphoenix,Trace finds rose to ask about saria
01-09-2018T23:47:09,Bgrmystr2,What page was it
01-09-2018T23:47:21,unsteddyphoenix,"""I-i order you to...tell me what she likes..."""
01-09-2018T23:47:32,Kinipshun,ooooo i like that one phoenix
01-09-2018T23:48:19,Bgrmystr2,OH the lil kid was trace that's right
01-09-2018T23:48:26,Bgrmystr2,he didn't have his blue dorito
01-09-2018T23:48:33,Bgrmystr2,so I wasn't 100% sure
01-09-2018T23:48:40,Kinipshun,dammit now i want some cool ranch
01-09-2018T23:48:48,Bgrmystr2,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/723/
01-09-2018T23:49:11,Kinipshun,but he DID have a bandain
01-09-2018T23:49:18,Kinipshun,*bandaid
01-09-2018T23:49:23,Bgrmystr2,well yeah..
01-09-2018T23:49:31,Kinipshun,dammit it's hard to type with a drawing glove
01-09-2018T23:49:35,Bgrmystr2,Maybe the blue dorito was just tiny and grew as he grew..
01-09-2018T23:49:48,Bgrmystr2,a little off topic tho xD oops
01-09-2018T23:50:33,Bgrmystr2,Trace wasn't like.. SUPER EVIL DARK TRACE at the time though
01-09-2018T23:50:38,Bgrmystr2,when he would have met Rose
01-09-2018T23:50:52,Bgrmystr2,cuz Saria wasn't dead at the time
01-09-2018T23:51:10,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah only mild racist
01-09-2018T23:51:18,Bgrmystr2,xD
01-09-2018T23:51:22,unsteddyphoenix,Instead of extra spicy
01-09-2018T23:51:36,Bgrmystr2,with a side of literal fire.
01-09-2018T23:51:55,Bgrmystr2,:fire:
01-09-2018T23:52:08,Kinipshun,oh shit my mixtape
01-09-2018T23:52:08,unsteddyphoenix,Things defintely got heated
01-09-2018T23:52:13,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
01-09-2018T23:53:01,Bgrmystr2,"Well, we know trace was trying to get the courage to talk to Saria.. maybe one of the days that she invited him into her house, he and rose met"
01-09-2018T23:53:30,Bgrmystr2,"though since he was young, I dunno if they would have more often met in the afternoon cuz of the templar school?"
01-09-2018T23:53:39,Bgrmystr2,or met more during days off? ..
01-09-2018T23:54:38,Bgrmystr2,Saria doesn't seem like the kind of person to hide a keidran but.. Rose may have been a different story
01-09-2018T23:54:51,Bgrmystr2,the bed image tom was drawin could have been plausable
01-09-2018T23:54:53,Kinipshun,yeah cuz they were good friends
01-09-2018T23:55:12,Bgrmystr2,it was also cuz she saved rose
01-09-2018T23:55:25,Kinipshun,wtf
01-09-2018T23:55:35,Kinipshun,oh weait i read that as SHAVED rose
01-09-2018T23:55:42,Bgrmystr2,..saved
01-09-2018T23:55:44,Bgrmystr2,no h
01-09-2018T23:55:55,Bgrmystr2,I promise you there was no h xD
01-09-2018T23:56:05,Kinipshun,shuddup its late
01-09-2018T23:56:07,Kinipshun,lol
01-09-2018T23:56:16,unsteddyphoenix,I kind of felt like saria would be upfront about rose to trace imo
01-09-2018T23:56:29,unsteddyphoenix,Like
01-09-2018T23:56:31,Bgrmystr2,"also, I think rose would take issue with you trying to imply that saria would shave her.."
01-09-2018T23:56:44,Bgrmystr2,since that'd be kinda mean lolol
01-09-2018T23:56:50,Bgrmystr2,"and yeah phoenix, I feel that"
01-09-2018T23:56:57,Kinipshun,id never shave a furred person lol
01-09-2018T23:57:20,Kinipshun,especially rose
01-09-2018T23:57:34,Bgrmystr2,I just don't know what time trace would be going by saria's place to visit since it's more likely that Rose probably didn't go out very much
01-09-2018T23:57:54,Bgrmystr2,cuz of the slavery and stuff
01-09-2018T23:58:41,Kinipshun,"so wait, was trace in any kind of relationship with saria BEFORE saria met rose"
01-09-2018T23:58:42,Kinipshun,?
01-09-2018T23:58:43,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah that stuff
01-09-2018T23:58:58,Bgrmystr2,no Kinip
01-09-2018T23:59:01,unsteddyphoenix,Though maybe saria would pressure her to go out
01-09-2018T23:59:02,Bgrmystr2,trace was way too young
01-09-2018T23:59:11,Bgrmystr2,Saria met rose way before trace
01-09-2018T23:59:46,Bgrmystr2,"by the time Saria met Trace, she would have already been living w/ Rose having saved her from being a slave"
