01-01-2018T01:43:36,MidnightBlue78,because I know that my kids are gonna start arguing and complaining about the cold
01-01-2018T01:43:53,MidnightBlue78,And I ain't got time for that shit

01-01-2018T01:49:28,ZizzoGaming,"I almost read it as ""cumdragon"" which didn't seem right"

01-01-2018T01:49:57,Bgrmystr2,at least that makes more sense.
01-01-2018T01:50:18,Bgrmystr2,the education system doesn't teach you every single word in the dictionary
01-01-2018T01:50:18,ZizzoGaming,Curmudgeon - a bad-tempered or surly person.
01-01-2018T01:50:29,MidnightBlue78,"hey, im a native Spanish speaker, I have an excuse lol"

01-01-2018T01:53:06,Bgrmystr2,"I don't really care, honestly. They're the ones walkin on my lawn and then nagging me about whether I'm gonna yell at them to get off it or not"
01-01-2018T01:53:07,ZizzoGaming,Princess unsteddy would probably behead anyone that steps foot on their lawn
01-01-2018T01:53:32,Bgrmystr2,People expect me to be this thing that they think I am

01-01-2018T02:15:28,MidnightBlue78,but you guys are really smart
01-01-2018T02:15:31,unsteddyphoenix,Why? Lack of funds?
01-01-2018T02:15:44,MidnightBlue78,yes
01-01-2018T02:15:53,MidnightBlue78,and lack of support
01-01-2018T02:15:56,Bgrmystr2,"Unfortunately, I was never able to graduate. The school refused me to go there. :c"
01-01-2018T02:15:57,unsteddyphoenix,Naw I'm a unsmarty

01-01-2018T02:16:23,unsteddyphoenix,Insane
01-01-2018T02:16:26,Bgrmystr2,but they wouldn't let me go back
01-01-2018T02:16:34,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I did live 45 mins away, so.."
01-01-2018T02:17:13,unsteddyphoenix,Ugh I had to bus an hour to uni. Terrible
01-01-2018T02:17:42,Bgrmystr2,my ride to school was always about a half hour or so after my school began
01-01-2018T02:18:05,Bgrmystr2,so I basically missed homeroom and a few mins of the first period basically every day
01-01-2018T02:18:13,Bgrmystr2,for about two years
01-01-2018T02:18:28,MidnightBlue78,thats bad
01-01-2018T02:18:39,Bgrmystr2,"not really, I mean, I was there for the whole day"
01-01-2018T02:18:40,Bgrmystr2,every day
01-01-2018T02:18:58,Bgrmystr2,"every time school was in, I was there, I just missed a few mins of the beginning"
01-01-2018T02:19:13,Bgrmystr2,each class was an hour and a half long
01-01-2018T02:19:18,MidnightBlue78,dont the tardies add up at some point?
01-01-2018T02:19:22,Bgrmystr2,so the first couple mins was just people getting ready
01-01-2018T02:19:29,Bgrmystr2,they're supposed to.
01-01-2018T02:19:36,Bgrmystr2,they just never did anything for me
01-01-2018T02:20:06,Bgrmystr2,I had a teacher try to give me detention for someshit they made up that I didn't do
01-01-2018T02:20:16,Bgrmystr2,"so I said fuck that, I'm not going"
01-01-2018T02:20:18,Bgrmystr2,only happened once though
01-01-2018T02:20:48,Bgrmystr2,"but other than that, I didn't cause any trouble or whatever"
01-01-2018T02:21:44,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: Slept in Geometry just about every day cuz it was right after gym.. Still passed
01-01-2018T02:21:52,MidnightBlue78,its really a miracle i graduated highschool with all the school i missed
01-01-2018T02:22:13,MidnightBlue78,teachers dont give a fuck back in PR
01-01-2018T02:22:34,Bgrmystr2,"Poor brian, he had the same class I did.. I didn't know him back when I started that class"
01-01-2018T02:22:37,MidnightBlue78,nobody at home gave a shit either
01-01-2018T02:22:40,Bgrmystr2,but by the end of the year I did
01-01-2018T02:22:53,Bgrmystr2,"I had a seat I liked, and then he took it"
01-01-2018T02:22:57,Bgrmystr2,cuz the teacher changed us
01-01-2018T02:23:10,Bgrmystr2,"For a bit, I didn't like him for taking my seat, but"
01-01-2018T02:23:21,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, he did all the work, participated in the board work, etc etc"
01-01-2018T02:23:26,Bgrmystr2,"did everything, still passed"
01-01-2018T02:23:30,Bgrmystr2,"erh, failed*"
01-01-2018T02:23:34,Bgrmystr2,"he failed, after doin all the things"
01-01-2018T02:23:44,Bgrmystr2,and I passed and didn't do the damn anything but the tests
01-01-2018T02:23:53,MidnightBlue78,that sucks big time
01-01-2018T02:24:01,Bgrmystr2,teacher hated the both of us
01-01-2018T02:24:09,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, she probably hated EVERYONE"
01-01-2018T02:24:22,Bgrmystr2,she was such an antagonistic person
01-01-2018T02:24:28,Bgrmystr2,:/
01-01-2018T02:24:55,MidnightBlue78,i bet your feeling was mutual lol
01-01-2018T02:25:11,Bgrmystr2,You bet your ass it was. :thumbsup:
01-01-2018T02:25:25,MidnightBlue78,XD
01-01-2018T02:25:27,Bgrmystr2,"I wasn't too miffed about the thing, honestly. Tests are the majority of your grade, and that's what I did."
01-01-2018T02:25:32,Bgrmystr2,And that's why I passed
01-01-2018T02:25:35,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-clovischuckle:
01-01-2018T02:25:51,Bgrmystr2,She couldn't legitimately fail me

01-01-2018T02:28:04,MidnightBlue78,"i hated chem, i liked biology though"
01-01-2018T02:29:14,Bgrmystr2,"I failed Biology, but it's only cuz dissecting a frog was a majority of the grade, and if you did that alone, you could pass the class, but if you didn't, you failed. Period."
01-01-2018T02:29:17,Bgrmystr2,and basically..
01-01-2018T02:29:21,Bgrmystr2,my stomach said nope
01-01-2018T02:29:23,Bgrmystr2,and fucked off

01-01-2018T02:29:38,Bgrmystr2,the smell alone was beyond ridiculous
01-01-2018T02:29:54,MidnightBlue78,i dissected a mouse in community college
01-01-2018T02:30:11,MidnightBlue78,i fucked up its teeny tiny bladder

01-01-2018T02:30:55,Bgrmystr2,"there's nothing I can do about my stomach. Just the fucking thought of it going to class was fucking with me, but when I got into the class, that smell destroyed me :ptv-grossedout:"
01-01-2018T02:31:18,Bgrmystr2,I couldn't go back
01-01-2018T02:31:22,Bgrmystr2,for the whole class period
01-01-2018T02:31:28,MidnightBlue78,"please, you're making me nauseated"

01-01-2018T20:29:31,TheBeckoner,Oh I see
01-01-2018T20:29:43,TheBeckoner,No clue what that is specifically but now I know

01-01-2018T20:53:03,DarkLinnk,okay totaly not what I guessed
01-01-2018T21:15:08,RandomTKLover,What is it? Im too lazy to google
01-01-2018T21:22:00,CrRAR,It's a school where you live!
01-01-2018T21:22:13,CrRAR,(ultra lame)
01-01-2018T21:24:39,CrRAR,I think though some can be swanky.
01-01-2018T21:29:11,CrRAR,"Huh, I never really thought about it but prep schools are sort of considered boarding schools."
01-01-2018T21:29:15,CrRAR,fun facts
01-01-2018T21:31:05,RandomTKLover,So are colleges boarding schools too?
01-01-2018T21:32:03,CrRAR,I think they escape that classification because the students are adult age?
01-01-2018T21:32:42,CrRAR,...but mayyybe?
01-01-2018T21:32:48,CrRAR,lol
01-01-2018T21:33:47,TheBeckoner,It all sucks anyway./?
01-01-2018T21:36:05,CrRAR,Yeah.... the skills you develop there are important but I think it's ridiculous society has bestowed that responsibility on colleges... esp for the price they charge.
01-01-2018T21:36:12,RandomTKLover,Life is never how we want
01-01-2018T21:36:44,RandomTKLover,"Too much responsibility, not enough time"

01-01-2018T21:38:21,CrRAR,no no
01-01-2018T21:38:28,TheBeckoner,Ah ok
01-01-2018T21:39:15,CrRAR,"But yeah, the college complaint only rings true in America, many other countries have it figured out that the youth are worth INVESTING in."
01-01-2018T21:40:11,CrRAR,"aaaanyway, that's all I have to say about that."
01-01-2018T21:42:56,TheBeckoner,"I agree. Although I'll say most things can be accoplished without college, its just a good path to get there easier than doing it on your own completely. It would be better it weren't so expensive"
01-01-2018T21:45:40,CrRAR,"Yeah, so true, the most successful kids go to college with a passion for the thing they pick to study. I think it's insane that college is basically the gatekeeper to success. It makes no sense. Pay to play at it's worst."
01-01-2018T21:46:47,CrRAR,"...but yeah having the trial of college is important though too for certain fields. Medicine, engineering. Proves your mettle."
01-01-2018T21:48:06,TheBeckoner,Yeah...I hope I end up making enough money before I finish college so I can quit and do business instead.
01-01-2018T21:48:19,TheBeckoner,do a business*
01-01-2018T21:48:42,CrRAR,"yeah, It's really the best time in a long time for small business!"
01-01-2018T21:49:19,CrRAR,There's markets now that didn't exist with all the population growth and millennials. haha
01-01-2018T21:49:49,CrRAR,"Lotsa customers to go around, more than big business can possibly handle!"
01-01-2018T21:50:14,CrRAR,Just gotta fine a niche in a good market.
