03-02-2018T14:49:02,TheFDdriver,hey*
03-02-2018T14:49:20,JaydenMozingo,has awaken
03-02-2018T14:49:21,JaydenMozingo,good afternoon everyone
03-02-2018T14:49:42,Bgrmystr2,Heya guys :ptv-greetings:
03-02-2018T14:49:56,JaydenMozingo,hello
03-02-2018T14:50:05,Bgrmystr2,"Guy here from our ISP upgrading the phone lines, had to disconnect the net."
03-02-2018T14:50:12,Bgrmystr2,thankfully it's back up before the stream starts :D
03-02-2018T14:51:44,qwe304,tom has arrived :P
03-02-2018T14:52:27,PalmettoPathfinder1,Well hopefully Tom will accept my request. Told him I would like one of the characters to be full body but doesn't have to be completely full body (but noted it would be nice if he was).
03-02-2018T14:52:49,NeonMitsumi,*suspicious look*
03-02-2018T14:53:02,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
03-02-2018T14:53:25,qwe304,"my suggestion for this week is ""Advanced laziness; young trace uses magic to do his chores:"
03-02-2018T14:53:43,PalmettoPathfinder1,The other character I said didn't have to be full body.
03-02-2018T14:54:44,PalmettoPathfinder1,Nice one qwe.  Reminds me of the Sorcerer's Apprentice
03-02-2018T14:54:55,Bgrmystr2,"I would ask what the suggestion is, but I don't want to be bias before the vote."
03-02-2018T14:55:21,NeonMitsumi,Dun dun
03-02-2018T14:57:25,PalmettoPathfinder1,I don't have a bias problem since I love all of the requests.
03-02-2018T14:57:52,Bgrmystr2,"that's irrelevant, yes you do"
03-02-2018T14:57:54,Bgrmystr2,everyone does
03-02-2018T14:58:26,Bgrmystr2,"knowing who suggested it automatically makes you bias in one way or another, though not always enough to sway your vote"
03-02-2018T14:59:26,PalmettoPathfinder1,Actually I don't care who suggests it.  Because I love y'all!
03-02-2018T14:59:46,qwe304,whats the problem with voting for a friends suggestion? (if its decent)
03-02-2018T15:00:11,PalmettoPathfinder1,And this is the month of love!  There's nothing wrong with voting for a friend's suggestions.
03-02-2018T15:00:21,RedDeath2018,Hey guys
03-02-2018T15:00:25,Bgrmystr2,"unfair voter advantage, qwe. Basically."
03-02-2018T15:00:37,wolfspartan1,hi red
03-02-2018T15:00:45,Bgrmystr2,"It's mostly unconscious, Palm"
03-02-2018T15:00:56,Bgrmystr2,you wouldn't know it even if you were
03-02-2018T15:01:05,qwe304,fairness is an unrealistic expectation
03-02-2018T15:01:10,RedDeath2018,Happy Super Bowl Sunday
03-02-2018T15:01:11,Bgrmystr2,not true
03-02-2018T15:01:22,wolfspartan1,you too red
03-02-2018T15:01:28,Bgrmystr2,tis why we have the polls set up on amenon's site
03-02-2018T15:01:35,qwe304,people are always biased to some extent
03-02-2018T15:01:47,Bgrmystr2,so noone can see the poll results before they're released
03-02-2018T15:02:02,PalmettoPathfinder1,Hi Red!
03-02-2018T15:02:13,RedDeath2018,Hey palm
03-02-2018T15:02:16,Bgrmystr2,"people will be bias, yes, but it only comes into play if you give it the chance."
03-02-2018T15:02:29,Bgrmystr2,knowing who suggested stuff is one such chance.
03-02-2018T15:02:45,Bgrmystr2,"without knowing, it never comes into play in the first place"
03-02-2018T15:03:12,PalmettoPathfinder1,I've figured out how to make my requests more organized.  After the suggestion I list the refs and what character they go with.
03-02-2018T15:03:41,Bgrmystr2,I would figure everyone does that?
03-02-2018T15:04:24,qwe304,"its a non-issue for me, tom doesnt need ref's for his own characters"
03-02-2018T15:04:46,Bgrmystr2,unless you're suggesting a particular sketch
03-02-2018T15:04:53,Bgrmystr2,one he doesn't remember :v
03-02-2018T15:05:02,Bgrmystr2,happened a few times
03-02-2018T15:06:49,JaydenMozingo,you know how ctrl+z undoes an action? what was the inverse to redo?
03-02-2018T15:07:43,Combak,... Undo?
03-02-2018T15:08:04,JaydenMozingo,an action when in digial art
03-02-2018T15:08:09,NeonMitsumi,Ctrl+Y
03-02-2018T15:08:13,qwe304,un-undo?
03-02-2018T15:08:16,RedDeath2018,Ctrl+y
03-02-2018T15:08:20,NeonMitsumi,Or Ctrl+Shift+Z in PS
03-02-2018T15:08:21,Bgrmystr2,but Ctrl+Y is not the inverse lol
03-02-2018T15:08:24,Bgrmystr2,xD
03-02-2018T15:08:33,RedDeath2018,What does he mean then
03-02-2018T15:08:55,Bgrmystr2,hell if I know? Inverse =|= reverse
03-02-2018T15:10:00,Bgrmystr2,probably meant to ask what the hotkey was for redo
03-02-2018T15:10:10,JaydenMozingo,yes
03-02-2018T15:10:16,NeonMitsumi,We got that.
03-02-2018T15:10:20,RedDeath2018,Oh
03-02-2018T15:10:27,Combak,"Well, some of you did."
03-02-2018T15:10:31,JaydenMozingo,what is it?
03-02-2018T15:10:39,NeonMitsumi,Ctrl+Y
03-02-2018T15:10:39,Combak,"... Well, us, not you."
03-02-2018T15:10:53,NeonMitsumi,"In Photoshop, Ctrl+Shift+Z"
03-02-2018T15:10:57,RedDeath2018,Hey if you were too choose one sketch to color what would it be??? It‚Äôs just a random question
03-02-2018T15:11:33,JaydenMozingo,yes!! ctrl+shift+z
03-02-2018T15:11:36,JaydenMozingo,thank you

03-02-2018T16:56:55,MuonNeutrino,so here's the real question - does saria *actually* have two eyes or not? &gt;.&gt;
03-02-2018T16:57:06,KawaiiFlora,We have seen both of her eyes before
03-02-2018T16:57:08,LeKnightWolf,?
03-02-2018T16:57:08,Terramaster20209,good question
03-02-2018T16:57:13,CrRAR,You could ask the same of Maren
03-02-2018T16:57:13,unsteddyphoenix,She has no eyes she ded bru

03-02-2018T16:57:24,FenceEqualizer,She has spooky eyes though.

03-02-2018T16:58:20,unsteddyphoenix,come on now
03-02-2018T16:58:24,MetalAppleSauce,It might exist but we'll never know
03-02-2018T16:58:25,ZephyrTWolffox,I would assume since its just a sketch it's not cannonical
03-02-2018T16:58:27,unsteddyphoenix,cant just say that
03-02-2018T16:58:40,CrRAR,If you look into her other eye you will gase into the infinite

03-02-2018T16:58:47,Ossem1,Its just a theory
03-02-2018T16:58:49,FenceEqualizer,We must keep that eye hidden.
03-02-2018T16:58:51,w0lfmare,Saria borrowed an eye from Maren
03-02-2018T16:58:59,FenceEqualizer,It's not made for this world.

03-02-2018T18:04:56,Terramaster20209,nibbly bed sized i think
03-02-2018T18:05:02,BadFoMo,"Nibbly: Hmm, you're so soft and fluffy, Sythe."
03-02-2018T18:05:10,Dadrobit,Really should make that drive one of these times.
03-02-2018T18:05:17,Bgrmystr2,"Both are yes, Terra"
03-02-2018T18:06:01,MetalAppleSauce,Nibbly is bed-size. Hence the collar
03-02-2018T18:06:11,Khalandar,https://twitter.com/SpadeCrux/status/891448949847932928
03-02-2018T18:06:24,Bgrmystr2,the fact that she's wearing the collar means the bed is equally nibbly-sized
03-02-2018T18:06:26,BadFoMo,Sythe: I didn't have the heart to tell her that she was hugging her own Tail.
03-02-2018T18:06:34,CrRAR,haha
03-02-2018T18:06:34,Bespin,owo

03-02-2018T18:06:43,FenceEqualizer,Her tail is bed size. Infact what you don't see is that Sythe is already trapped in fluffiness.
03-02-2018T18:07:05,CrRAR,haha *Tom adds his head sticking out*
03-02-2018T18:07:11,TorqueEmUp,Yep Sythe be engulfed by Nibbly tail

03-02-2018T18:07:19,Dadrobit,Sythe's hand should be sticking out of the tail fluff giving the Terminator's thumbs up.

03-02-2018T18:53:24,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Heck, it might still get chosen as a Tom Pick.  He doesn't always pick the second highest one though."
03-02-2018T18:53:36,Ordithus,"Here's a tip: most of the colored art is on his dA, which actually has functional search, unlike Patreon."
03-02-2018T18:53:47,Terramaster20209,wchich round is this ?
03-02-2018T18:53:48,BluePhantom90,Hey Tom said sketch not color

03-02-2018T18:54:10,unsteddyphoenix,Why would he want a sketch over clean lineart
03-02-2018T18:54:12,PalmettoPathfinder1,I've seen him draw requests that weren't in the top 5.
03-02-2018T18:54:18,Terramaster20209,then i missed one i think
03-02-2018T18:54:21,PalmettoPathfinder1,Or even in the top 10
03-02-2018T18:54:34,Ordithus,Maren's bikini pinup was almost dead last when Tom drew it
03-02-2018T18:54:35,unsteddyphoenix,Or that was in last place

03-02-2018T18:55:52,unsteddyphoenix,sounds fake
03-02-2018T18:56:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Best hangover cure is to not drink in the first place
03-02-2018T18:56:17,ThingsAreMoving,where's the fun in that?
03-02-2018T18:56:21,unsteddyphoenix,sounds fake
03-02-2018T18:56:21,Xexanoth,or never stop
03-02-2018T18:56:28,PalmettoPathfinder1,Maybe Tom should do a theme stream.  You know where our requests have to match a certain theme.
03-02-2018T18:56:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"not crashing your car into somebody, thats fun"
03-02-2018T18:56:38,Xexanoth,can't have a hangover if you're still drunk

03-02-2018T18:56:58,ThingsAreMoving,drinking and driving should result in 3 months of hard labour
