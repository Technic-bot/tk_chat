28-09-2018T00:03:30,Dadrobit,And I gotta stop procrastinating and get back to editing...
28-09-2018T00:04:02,Dadrobit,Now I am become an audio engineer. Destroyer of deep breaths and bad takes.

28-09-2018T00:13:26,SageSaga,So any change to your idea Zro?
28-09-2018T00:18:45,ZRO4825,Well from the sounds of it I'm kinda gonna have to change it. So I'm trying to think. :joy:
28-09-2018T00:19:51,Bgrmystr2,I mean....... bowsette is still an option :V
28-09-2018T00:20:03,Bgrmystr2,and you can even birthday theme it
28-09-2018T00:20:05,SageSaga,no it isnt
28-09-2018T00:20:15,Bgrmystr2,whynot :u
28-09-2018T00:21:06,SageSaga,i really gotta say it again? It's my characters and im not drawing any of them cosplaying as Bowsette
28-09-2018T00:21:21,Bgrmystr2,I didn't say your characters
28-09-2018T00:21:25,Bgrmystr2,:o
28-09-2018T00:21:47,SageSaga,you do know what the patreon commissions are right?
28-09-2018T00:22:24,Bgrmystr2,do they HAVE to be your characters? :o
28-09-2018T00:22:29,ZRO4825,"It says so, yar."
28-09-2018T00:23:00,ZRO4825,"I mean, you can bend the rules a little with say, Mihari, or something like that, if Sage okays it, but TECHNICALLY the posting does say Yosh or AI characters."
28-09-2018T00:23:21,Bgrmystr2,ah okay
28-09-2018T00:23:29,SageSaga,there is some ways to stretch it- but the idea is to prevent people from asking for their OCs or whatevers popular
28-09-2018T00:23:32,Bgrmystr2,"so sage is just being mean then, got it :v"
28-09-2018T00:24:05,ZRO4825,"You won't draw my OC either way, Sage, you done said you wouldn't. Too many tails. :P"
28-09-2018T00:24:14,SageSaga,i dont wanna draw your 13 dragon winged muscle man with 2 dicks
28-09-2018T00:24:16,unsteddyphoenix,It IS a lot of tails
28-09-2018T00:24:36,ZRO4825,There's only 9! :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
28-09-2018T00:24:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ptv-shock: 9!
28-09-2018T00:25:05,ZRO4825,9!
28-09-2018T00:25:13,unsteddyphoenix,Bowsette a lot easier by comparison~
28-09-2018T00:25:14,SageSaga,he means tails not dicks
28-09-2018T00:25:29,ZRO4825,Indeed.
28-09-2018T00:25:49,Dadrobit,But one of them is at least the size o half of his torso.
28-09-2018T00:25:52,Bgrmystr2,⑨ ? :ptv-wondering:
28-09-2018T00:25:54,Dadrobit,of*

28-09-2018T07:54:20,Twokinds,So much food
28-09-2018T07:57:57,unsteddyphoenix,Ooh niiice
28-09-2018T07:58:03,unsteddyphoenix,Thats pretty much like
28-09-2018T07:58:11,unsteddyphoenix,The best part of travelling~
28-09-2018T07:58:27,iliar,And what about the taste? Do you like Korean food?
28-09-2018T07:59:03,unsteddyphoenix,Was the place you drew in the filler somewhere you went to?
28-09-2018T08:01:41,Twokinds,yeah & yeah
28-09-2018T08:02:29,iliar,"I have a question. We know that Reni is 20 years old. But we don't know how much it for dragons. I mean for humans adulthood is 18, for keidran adulthood is 8, but what about dragons."
28-09-2018T08:06:02,unsteddyphoenix,Ooh cool~
28-09-2018T08:06:06,unsteddyphoenix,"What was it like, a temple?"
28-09-2018T08:10:38,Twokinds,"It was a palace, aparently"
28-09-2018T08:13:33,unsteddyphoenix,Really? It seemed all...shinto-y
28-09-2018T08:14:21,unsteddyphoenix,How much tourist-ing have you been doing?
28-09-2018T08:18:56,Twokinds,A lot
28-09-2018T08:20:02,Twokinds,We've been from Seoul to Busan
28-09-2018T08:21:26,unsteddyphoenix,Woah thats like
28-09-2018T08:21:30,unsteddyphoenix,Literally across the country
28-09-2018T08:21:41,Twokinds,We also got to go up near the DMZ
28-09-2018T08:22:16,Twokinds,"Got some pictures of technically North Korea, though obviously from a distance."
28-09-2018T08:22:37,unsteddyphoenix,Interesting
28-09-2018T08:22:48,unsteddyphoenix,Was there a lot of military there?
28-09-2018T08:23:04,Twokinds,Uh
28-09-2018T08:23:14,Twokinds,"Where we were, it was actually a festival going on"
28-09-2018T08:23:43,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh, huh."
28-09-2018T08:23:59,unsteddyphoenix,I thought there was usually soldiers posted up there.
28-09-2018T08:24:11,unsteddyphoenix,maybe im thinking of something else
28-09-2018T08:24:14,Twokinds,It's pretty weird. Right next to the barbed wire fences is parents and kids flying kits in a park.
28-09-2018T08:24:33,Twokinds,We weren't at the main gate
28-09-2018T08:24:39,Twokinds,this was just nearby
28-09-2018T08:25:11,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh ok
28-09-2018T08:26:00,unsteddyphoenix,Was the festival celebrating anything in particular?
28-09-2018T08:27:35,Twokinds,It was Korean thanksgiving
28-09-2018T08:28:07,Twokinds,Chuseok

28-09-2018T14:21:40,Rosscoe,Such is life
28-09-2018T14:24:02,SageSaga,i am familiar with that feeling intimately
28-09-2018T14:28:49,Soundbytee,"Hoh, I finally turned on the audio. Slick music. Also, hi Sage. Looks cool!"
28-09-2018T14:30:15,SageSaga,hello Soundbytee- thank you

28-09-2018T14:31:28,Rosscoe,I find the cell phone version of any web broswing to be terrible.
28-09-2018T14:31:29,SageSaga,congrats Zro
28-09-2018T14:32:02,ZRO4825,"Won't argue that, Ross, lol"
28-09-2018T14:32:35,ZRO4825,Awww there it goes back to still image. The dream is dead. 😂
28-09-2018T14:41:58,Rosscoe,I got a big cheese pizza in the freezer and I am not sure when I want too cook it.
28-09-2018T14:42:22,SageSaga,never
28-09-2018T14:42:33,ZRO4825,lol
28-09-2018T14:44:02,SageSaga,i speak out of pain... of never being able to eat pizza again
28-09-2018T14:44:40,Soundbytee,that's unfortunate :(
28-09-2018T14:55:01,Rosscoe,That is
28-09-2018T14:55:16,Rosscoe,"Cause for 5 bucks, you get the pizza, then you jsut add your own stuff to it."
28-09-2018T14:58:14,SageSaga,"why not pay 5 bucks, and get a pizza with what you want on it?"
28-09-2018T15:00:48,Rosscoe,Doesn
28-09-2018T15:00:51,Rosscoe,doesn
28-09-2018T15:00:55,Rosscoe,t exsist

28-09-2018T15:01:09,Rosscoe,other wise its cardboard Mccanes pizza's BLEH
28-09-2018T15:01:37,SageSaga,i used to get good frozen pizzas with toppings for 5  bucks all the time that was really good
28-09-2018T15:01:51,SageSaga,better than that Dijornowhatsits
28-09-2018T15:02:28,SageSaga,but prices could have changed in 4 years
28-09-2018T15:02:47,Rosscoe,"When I moved two provinces over in canada the pizza choices are still teh same, 5 bucks for garbage or get a pre pared from scratch local pizza and you just add to it."
28-09-2018T15:02:51,Soundbytee,Wait. Wait. they do exist.
28-09-2018T15:02:59,Soundbytee,If you only want pepperoni
28-09-2018T15:03:05,Soundbytee,it's still 5 bucks
28-09-2018T15:03:42,Rosscoe,"Mccanes pizza's are about 5 bucks before tax here, but like I said they taste liek cardboard :P"
28-09-2018T15:03:56,MatyMaty,why not get a pizza without tomato? :O
28-09-2018T15:03:59,SageSaga,oh - 5CD not 5USD

28-09-2018T15:06:55,SageSaga,now if you want a great pizza- that cost more

28-09-2018T15:08:20,SageSaga,local Pizza places- we have an actual Italian restaurant that does real pizza
28-09-2018T15:08:23,ZRO4825,O hiyas Maty ^^
28-09-2018T15:08:29,MatyMaty,Hi Zro!
28-09-2018T15:09:02,SageSaga,and we have a more traditional Subs and Pizza local place that does the NY style pizza
28-09-2018T15:09:25,MatyMaty,There's a pizza place down here where you can change the tomato sauce for 4 chesee sauce
28-09-2018T15:09:31,MatyMaty,it is pretty nice that way
28-09-2018T15:09:32,SageSaga,"both are far better than Papa Johns, also they arent dick bags like Papa John himself"
28-09-2018T15:10:34,Soundbytee,"deep dish is pretty great. There's a place in chicago, you have to wait 45 minutes but I find it so worth it"
28-09-2018T15:10:41,Rosscoe,Local pizza goes from 18 to 30
28-09-2018T15:10:44,SageSaga,i had a friend who was fired for staying 10 minutes over his work time to help a new employee who was all alone in the kitchen
28-09-2018T15:10:52,MatyMaty,yikes
28-09-2018T15:10:57,Rosscoe,Grocery store stuff starts at 5 bucks going to 10 bucks
28-09-2018T15:11:08,Rosscoe,ECK
28-09-2018T15:11:10,Rosscoe,thats rude
28-09-2018T15:11:22,Rosscoe,And terrible boss
28-09-2018T15:11:43,SageSaga,"""The rule is once your time is up you are out of the store, we aren't paying any overtime"""
28-09-2018T15:12:11,Soundbytee,dang
28-09-2018T15:12:33,SageSaga,"""Papa Johns, everyone is expendable"""
28-09-2018T15:12:45,MatyMaty,x_x
28-09-2018T15:14:00,ZRO4825,Not far from the truth in almost any restaurant
28-09-2018T15:14:26,SageSaga,that was a local issue- but even then - Papa John himself is a dickbag
28-09-2018T15:15:32,SageSaga,Dominoes isnt bad for cheep pizza though
28-09-2018T15:16:15,SageSaga,it varies from store to store- but they have some good seasoning they use and toppings
28-09-2018T15:16:34,MatyMaty,Cotsco's pizza is great :P
28-09-2018T15:16:35,SageSaga,i used to get a BBQ chicken thin crust pizza from them
28-09-2018T15:16:40,MatyMaty,and cheaper than dominos
28-09-2018T15:17:02,SageSaga,I dont have a Costco near here
28-09-2018T15:17:07,MatyMaty,booo
28-09-2018T15:17:31,SageSaga,again though- not that i can eat pizza anymore XD
28-09-2018T15:17:36,ZRO4825,We're probably the best of the chains
28-09-2018T15:18:02,Rosscoe,"I been to costco once,"
28-09-2018T15:18:13,Rosscoe,was told you can not buy anyhting wihtout a costco memberhsip card
28-09-2018T15:18:15,Rosscoe,so I left
28-09-2018T15:18:58,Rosscoe,I remember a Costco sales rep would show up at my work place now and then once or twice a year too sell new memberships but none are ever interested
28-09-2018T15:19:57,MatyMaty,Sage why not eat pizza without tomato?
28-09-2018T15:20:12,SageSaga,it's not Pizza without Tomato
28-09-2018T15:20:16,MatyMaty,well yes Rosscoe
28-09-2018T15:20:22,MatyMaty,that's the point :P
28-09-2018T15:20:53,MatyMaty,focaccia then? :P
28-09-2018T15:20:55,MatyMaty,its close
28-09-2018T15:21:23,SageSaga,i also avoid bread
28-09-2018T15:24:56,Rosscoe,"I cant avoid bread, its part of my ""Liviing on a ratio diet"""
28-09-2018T15:25:00,Rosscoe,Ration*
28-09-2018T15:25:57,SageSaga,bread doesnt cause me much issues with my health- but- i am not physically active enough to condone eating so many carbs
28-09-2018T15:27:07,Rosscoe,"Yea, carbs are an issue,"
28-09-2018T15:27:11,SageSaga,so i now have very little bread and very little sugar- and no Tomatoes
28-09-2018T15:27:31,Rosscoe,What about Potatoe's?
28-09-2018T15:27:49,SageSaga,occasionally- they are also high carb
28-09-2018T15:30:33,Rosscoe,"If your not moving around alot, yes avoid high carby foods"
28-09-2018T16:03:54,SageSaga,huh
28-09-2018T16:03:59,SageSaga,did i finish already?
28-09-2018T16:04:55,Soundbytee,oh?
28-09-2018T16:05:31,SageSaga,this is almost an hour earlier than usual
28-09-2018T16:05:52,SageSaga,i guess i can work on my other picture
28-09-2018T16:06:19,Soundbytee,"Wow, nice :D Also, gotta say I think my favorite part of watching today was the eyes."
28-09-2018T16:06:35,SageSaga,have you seen the comic Soundbytee?
28-09-2018T16:07:10,Soundbytee,"Mhm, I kinda unintentionally check the whole of Katbox daily even if I know that there haven't been any updates..."
28-09-2018T16:07:24,Soundbytee,But I really like this one in particular :)
28-09-2018T16:07:46,SageSaga,thank you
28-09-2018T16:08:10,SageSaga,im wrapping up the chapter soon and so ive been working on the next Chapter Cover
28-09-2018T16:08:56,Soundbytee,Everything is on fire... I like how I have absolutely no idea how it could escalate to this
28-09-2018T16:11:47,SageSaga,a lot more action in the next chapter ^^
28-09-2018T16:12:53,Rosscoe,Lots of action.
28-09-2018T16:13:46,Soundbytee,ooh sweet
28-09-2018T16:17:54,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-sleepy: slept like a rock, so much of my body is sore"
28-09-2018T16:18:29,Bgrmystr2,good morning everyone
28-09-2018T16:18:42,Bgrmystr2,you continuing the next page I see
28-09-2018T16:18:44,SageSaga,darn i cant make this work
28-09-2018T16:18:50,SageSaga,this isnt the next page
28-09-2018T16:18:51,Bgrmystr2,"well, the next next page"
28-09-2018T16:18:53,Soundbytee,Heyo
28-09-2018T16:19:05,Bgrmystr2,"it's the page after the one you already finished, yeh?"
28-09-2018T16:19:14,SageSaga,nope
28-09-2018T16:19:32,SageSaga,Cover Pages dont replace comic updates
28-09-2018T16:20:12,Bgrmystr2,"I didn't say it did, it's just that when I click the next button, what I will see is the cover page"
28-09-2018T16:20:15,Bgrmystr2,:o
28-09-2018T16:20:17,Bgrmystr2,right?
28-09-2018T16:20:55,SageSaga,no
28-09-2018T16:20:57,SageSaga,XD
28-09-2018T16:21:11,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
28-09-2018T16:21:40,Bgrmystr2,okay I'll take your word for it. It's too early for me to brain
28-09-2018T16:21:41,SageSaga,"this is page 24, there is a Page 25 and 26, THEN the cover"
28-09-2018T16:22:07,Bgrmystr2,oooh there's a bunch of pages before the cover
28-09-2018T16:22:15,Bgrmystr2,"right, I forgot this isn't the last page"
28-09-2018T16:23:25,Bgrmystr2,"Gonna go wake up, brb"
28-09-2018T16:30:10,CommanderTrace,hello
28-09-2018T16:30:52,Soundbytee,Heyo
28-09-2018T16:35:04,Bgrmystr2,"back, moreish awake noow"
28-09-2018T16:36:29,SageSaga,wb
28-09-2018T16:38:58,Rosscoe,"ill brb, making brugers now"
28-09-2018T16:49:32,Rosscoe,oh nice Sage
28-09-2018T16:50:07,Rosscoe,Is this what happens to Nyna when shes on her digi peroid? (He says jokingly) :ptv-laugh:
28-09-2018T16:51:06,SageSaga,This chapter drops bodies
28-09-2018T16:56:58,Soundbytee,This playlist drops bodies
28-09-2018T16:58:58,SageSaga,i hope thats a good thing
28-09-2018T16:59:37,Soundbytee,Yes. Yes is it
28-09-2018T17:01:50,Rosscoe,"Bodies, bodies everywhere!"
28-09-2018T17:03:25,Soundbytee,Anyone seen the cat video where the owner uses her cat to pick up all the toilet paper it shredded?
28-09-2018T17:04:36,SageSaga,nope
28-09-2018T17:04:36,Bgrmystr2,"I don't regularly watch cat videos, so.."
28-09-2018T17:04:37,Bgrmystr2,no
28-09-2018T17:05:06,Rosscoe,nope
28-09-2018T17:08:53,Soundbytee,"It was by chance I caught it, but for some reason when you said bodies it made me imagine Kaylin doing that with Nyna if she harmed anyone, picking up all the bodies"
28-09-2018T17:10:56,SageSaga,Most of the bodies dropped will be Nyna's body count ^_^
28-09-2018T17:11:30,SageSaga,but i wont say more than that- that would be spoilers and not a teaser
28-09-2018T17:11:52,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-ohmy::ptv-excited:
28-09-2018T17:14:15,Rosscoe,"Nyna dropping bodies, while the other(s) go ""Do we, do we need to be here?"""
28-09-2018T17:17:14,SageSaga,hmmm
28-09-2018T17:18:07,SageSaga,ive been going back and forth on their name- I think Blood Claw is better- but it might be too Edgy
28-09-2018T17:21:39,SageSaga,no comments?
28-09-2018T17:21:44,Soundbytee,still thinkin
28-09-2018T17:22:25,Soundbytee,other thought you had was Red Claw?
28-09-2018T17:22:48,Rosscoe,Sorry was filling out time sheets
28-09-2018T17:22:52,Rosscoe,um
28-09-2018T17:22:57,Rosscoe,Blood Claw sounds fine to me
28-09-2018T17:23:06,SageSaga,Yeah -  Red Claw Bandits vs Blood Claw Bandits
28-09-2018T17:23:34,Rosscoe,"Looking for something less edgy there is always ""Crimson Fist"""
28-09-2018T17:23:54,SageSaga,it's a clawed gauntlet-
28-09-2018T17:24:01,Rosscoe,So Claw has to say
28-09-2018T17:24:09,Rosscoe,So Crimson Claw
28-09-2018T17:24:15,Soundbytee,"I like the alliteration with Blood, and the ""edgy"" feel Blood gives makes me more curious than Red"
28-09-2018T17:24:45,Soundbytee,"ohh, there's that too, sounds cool"
28-09-2018T17:25:03,SageSaga,and they are bandits- would be a waste to use Crimson on a group of bandits when i can have Crimson Sorcerers or Knights
28-09-2018T17:26:38,Rosscoe,"Hmm, what about Blood Talons? Its still a claw like word :)"
28-09-2018T17:27:13,SageSaga,nah I think ive settled on Blood Claw unless someone really important rejects it
28-09-2018T17:27:39,Rosscoe,Kinda funny how its been a two person response so far lol
28-09-2018T17:28:26,Soundbytee,"Mhm, and I usually lurk too.."
28-09-2018T17:29:42,BadFoMo,"What about ""Bloody McBlood Claw Hoolagens""?"
28-09-2018T17:30:18,SageSaga,Staby Mc Stabertons Stab Factory
28-09-2018T17:31:13,Rosscoe,The Bloody blood of blood Claw of Blood Brothers
28-09-2018T17:32:24,Soundbytee,Kaylin can't keep Nyna from gnawing numerous bad blood bandits
28-09-2018T17:33:15,SageSaga,alright well i managed to do all the coloring for both the comic and next chapter cover in- 3 hours and 30 minutes-
28-09-2018T17:35:38,ZRO4825,I get to say hello again! Except now from home.
28-09-2018T17:35:39,Bgrmystr2,"back, was talkin to someone about things D:"
28-09-2018T17:35:41,ZRO4825,Yay panic attacks.
28-09-2018T17:35:41,Soundbytee,"Nice. I've got nothing to compare that time to, but it sounds quick"
28-09-2018T17:35:43,SageSaga,thanks for joining everyone!
28-09-2018T17:35:46,Bgrmystr2,I see I missed a lot
28-09-2018T17:35:48,Bgrmystr2,wow Dx
28-09-2018T17:35:51,Bgrmystr2,perfect timing
28-09-2018T17:35:54,ZRO4825,Right? lol
28-09-2018T17:35:58,Bgrmystr2,"what claw were you showing, sage"
28-09-2018T17:36:23,BadFoMo,That one.
28-09-2018T17:36:45,Bgrmystr2,oh it looked kinda like a foot or whatever from like.. some big dragon or somesuch the other night
28-09-2018T17:36:52,Bgrmystr2,so I wasn't sure
28-09-2018T17:37:07,Bgrmystr2,that looks nice
28-09-2018T17:37:28,SageSaga,Take care :D Ending when the song does
28-09-2018T17:37:47,ZRO4825,Have a g'night Sage ^_^
28-09-2018T17:37:53,Bgrmystr2,"yeah I was gonna say, you could use talons as an alternate name, Crimson Talon sounds good to me"
28-09-2018T17:37:59,Bgrmystr2,but yeh thanks for streamin :D
28-09-2018T17:38:17,Soundbytee,Night! Thanks for the stream
28-09-2018T17:38:28,Rosscoe,Sage thats alot of carbs you bruned on teh hand / joints today!
28-09-2018T17:38:32,SageSaga,is not a talon though
28-09-2018T17:38:48,Rosscoe,"better eat a slice of bread, KIDDING!"
28-09-2018T17:38:51,Rosscoe,Aight later man!
28-09-2018T17:38:53,BadFoMo,"What about this title? ""The Blood Claw Bandits, and the Claw of Blood""?"
28-09-2018T17:39:17,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. claw.. talon..
28-09-2018T17:39:25,Bgrmystr2,eh :v
28-09-2018T19:15:35,Dadrobit,"It is pushing it on being ""edgy"". Maybe try doing it in another language. Bandidos de Garra Carmesí is pretty sexy no?"
28-09-2018T19:42:29,unsteddyphoenix,"When in doubt, bust out the latin"
28-09-2018T23:41:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Kinda missin the ol Patreons
