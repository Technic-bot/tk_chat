13-07-2018T00:19:08,ZRO4825,:thinking: Does she have a wardrobe system so all those outfits aren't taking up inventory space?

13-07-2018T00:19:35,SageSaga,she has all of her event clothes in her storage because as event items they dont take up any space

13-07-2018T00:20:58,ZRO4825,Kaylin looks nice in just about anything imo. Maid outfits are always nice though. &lt;3
13-07-2018T00:21:00,Bgrmystr2,event items don't take up space? Sage you are a god among men. I cannot tell you how bad it was in maple knowing that every event item took a new slot in your inventory..
13-07-2018T00:21:03,Bgrmystr2,&gt;.&gt;
13-07-2018T00:21:15,TheFDdriver,like you want to but cant get out of your dream
13-07-2018T00:21:15,ZRO4825,I can understand that pain Bgr. It was the same way in FFXI.
13-07-2018T00:21:28,Dadrobit,The center lies approximately anterior to the second sacral vertebra.
13-07-2018T00:21:28,ZRO4825,Stupid 80 slot inventory back in the day. @.@
13-07-2018T00:21:40,Bgrmystr2,and max inven slots was 96.. and you had to pay like $5 just to get 8 slots..
13-07-2018T00:22:04,Bgrmystr2,and there was four separate tabs you had to pay that shit for
13-07-2018T00:22:05,Bgrmystr2,Dx
13-07-2018T00:22:10,Bgrmystr2,was unreal
13-07-2018T00:22:28,Bgrmystr2,I will forever hate that damned easter event.
13-07-2018T00:22:57,ZRO4825,"FFXI did eventually manage to give us a good number more inventory sections, but my god back in the day it was hell, lol"
13-07-2018T00:22:58,Mippy,I’m not sure FDdriver...but I have experienced sleep paralysis

13-07-2018T00:24:10,TheFDdriver,*3 days*
13-07-2018T00:24:22,Cyborgthree,Not that bad though

13-07-2018T00:46:11,Ordithus,Or do you mean since then?
13-07-2018T00:46:15,SageSaga,the plan is to get this done and then work on Mihari's tonight if i have time!
13-07-2018T00:46:26,ZRO4825,"I have been here the whole time, and no, he has not, Mihari. Yet."
13-07-2018T00:46:36,Ordithus,"Aerie, Marv, not Nyna"
13-07-2018T00:46:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Ah
13-07-2018T00:46:57,Mihari,"I see how it is, I know my place on the totem pole T_T"
13-07-2018T00:47:12,Cyborgthree,:(
13-07-2018T00:47:27,MatyMaty,Cheetahs are bad totem animals
13-07-2018T00:47:29,RimaDraws,i so need to learn to use that wand tool to shade
13-07-2018T00:47:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Sad Mihari bums me out

13-07-2018T00:48:57,MatyMaty,"Hey, eagle would work too :P Predator, is swift and athletic"
13-07-2018T00:49:08,Cyborgthree,lol
13-07-2018T00:49:23,SageSaga,Not great at running
13-07-2018T00:49:32,Ordithus,But much better at flying
13-07-2018T00:49:34,Bgrmystr2,"ah yeah sorry Mihari, been here the whole stream too, was lookin at somethin else"
13-07-2018T00:49:38,Bgrmystr2,but yeah can confirm
13-07-2018T00:49:45,Bgrmystr2,no demands :u
13-07-2018T00:49:54,MatyMaty,Flying is the running of birbs
13-07-2018T00:50:01,MatyMaty,walking is like
13-07-2018T00:50:07,MatyMaty,crawling for non birbs :P
13-07-2018T00:50:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"If Mihari is a brib, then we can play the free brid solo everytime she's online"
13-07-2018T00:51:03,Cyborgthree,lol
13-07-2018T00:51:11,Dadrobit,*Church Massacre Intensifies*
13-07-2018T00:51:13,MatyMaty,"but seriously I guess if Mihari wasn't a cheetah, what it ius a fast running animal?"
13-07-2018T00:51:19,SageSaga,more reason for her to not be and just be the sexy cheetah she is
13-07-2018T00:51:21,MatyMaty,"bunny, gazelle"
13-07-2018T00:51:25,Ordithus,Horse
13-07-2018T00:51:27,MatyMaty,boo
13-07-2018T00:51:41,Dadrobit,Some dogs
13-07-2018T00:51:51,SageSaga,Should Maty be not a dog?
13-07-2018T00:52:11,MatyMaty,Mmmmm
13-07-2018T00:52:13,Mihari,"There is a reason I didn't choose an avian, I would have made her like the actual animal, thus no boobs, and there would be clocoa and eggs only, so a very boring future of porn if it existed, plus no predators comic, so...."
13-07-2018T00:52:23,MatyMaty,oh
13-07-2018T00:52:32,Cyborgthree,lion or wolf
13-07-2018T00:52:35,Dadrobit,I don't get that question.
13-07-2018T00:52:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I thought you hated that comic?
13-07-2018T00:52:42,MatyMaty,that makes a lot of sense :P
13-07-2018T00:52:48,Twokinds,and feathers are hard to draw
13-07-2018T00:52:53,Mihari,That too
13-07-2018T00:52:56,Cyborgthree,yea
13-07-2018T00:53:07,Mihari,I make Tom and Sage cry when I mention wings.
13-07-2018T00:53:19,MatyMaty,Heh
13-07-2018T00:53:25,ZRO4825,lol
13-07-2018T00:53:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Tom just hates wings in general
13-07-2018T00:53:33,MatyMaty,I know several artists that do charge extra for winged charas
13-07-2018T00:53:35,Mihari,Most artists do
13-07-2018T00:53:36,Dadrobit,Unless they're dragons
13-07-2018T00:53:36,SageSaga,wings are the bane of artist and the scourge of OCs
13-07-2018T00:53:41,ZRO4825,"Oh come on, Tom was having all sorts of fun with Nora's wings the other day"
13-07-2018T00:53:42,Cyborgthree,so much fun to draw
13-07-2018T00:53:44,Dadrobit,Cause those are just skin wings
13-07-2018T00:53:55,Xexanoth,if something is hard to draw you just need to draw it more for training :ptv-sneakysmirk:
13-07-2018T00:54:05,Mihari,Not nessicarly
13-07-2018T00:54:12,Cyborgthree,yea but the feathers....
13-07-2018T00:54:12,MatyMaty,not really Xexa
13-07-2018T00:54:15,Mihari,practice only takes you so far.
13-07-2018T00:54:20,Cyborgthree,that too
13-07-2018T00:54:26,Mihari,"You can be a master at drawing them, but they still are a pain to do."
13-07-2018T00:54:43,Cyborgthree,there we go
13-07-2018T00:54:45,MatyMaty,mmhmm
13-07-2018T00:55:08,Dadrobit,"If I owned a car company, would naming it ""Practice"" work?"
13-07-2018T00:55:22,Dadrobit,"Like, ""Practice makes perfect cars"""
13-07-2018T00:55:31,Dadrobit,Or would it get taken in a negative light?
13-07-2018T00:55:33,Mihari,Only if your cars lived up to it.
13-07-2018T00:55:43,Mihari,Which is impossible
13-07-2018T00:55:45,Dadrobit,"But, like, doctors are constantly ""practicing"""
13-07-2018T00:55:57,Ordithus,That's their excuse
13-07-2018T00:55:57,Cyborgthree,you can be good at something but it can be a pain or worse
13-07-2018T00:56:00,MatyMaty,Or if you are using Nekonny's comic for a theme
13-07-2018T00:56:12,ZRO4825,lol
13-07-2018T00:56:20,Mihari,I could be really mean.
13-07-2018T00:56:23,Dadrobit,"Ah, I need to cahth up on that one"
13-07-2018T00:56:24,Mihari,But I won't
13-07-2018T00:56:25,Dadrobit,catch*
13-07-2018T00:56:45,Cyborgthree,being good and liking it are different things
13-07-2018T00:56:48,MatyMaty,:p
13-07-2018T00:56:57,Dadrobit,"Pls don't censor yourself against being mean to me, I probably won't remember tonight anyways"
13-07-2018T00:56:58,Cyborgthree,lol
13-07-2018T00:57:35,Mihari,"I wasn't talking about you, I have no calms of being honest to the point of being mean to people, when they are here to hear it."
13-07-2018T00:57:43,Mihari,qualms*
13-07-2018T00:57:46,Dadrobit,"Oh, alrighty then."
13-07-2018T00:58:15,Pimsan,"Anyway, how was the anthro-con?"
13-07-2018T00:59:14,Pimsan,I couldn't be there since i was in Paris for Japan Expo.
13-07-2018T00:59:24,MatyMaty,"ah, is time to head to bed. Nite nite everyone!"
13-07-2018T00:59:27,MatyMaty,Have fun!
13-07-2018T00:59:29,SageSaga,it was just the best. Everyone was so nice and giving. There was not a single bad thing to be said about the convention

13-07-2018T01:00:47,Pimsan,"Ouch. Did something happen that made you skip the con, SageSage?"
13-07-2018T01:01:01,Mihari,Money

13-07-2018T01:02:19,FluffKevlar,what the HECK
13-07-2018T01:02:21,Mihari,You don't do overly fluffly stuff.
13-07-2018T01:02:29,Mihari,And Rei has you whipped :P
13-07-2018T01:02:37,Mihari,So clearly not hte master!
13-07-2018T01:02:40,RimaDraws,hey fluff

13-07-2018T01:02:59,Cyborgthree,good
13-07-2018T01:03:04,Dadrobit,I think Infintedge held that title for a while?
13-07-2018T01:03:25,Ordithus,"That's floof, robit.  it's different"
13-07-2018T01:03:34,Xexanoth,the is no such thing as moderation when it comes to fluffy
13-07-2018T01:04:09,SageSaga,pretty sure Moom beats Infinitedge
13-07-2018T01:04:18,Mihari,I was gonna say
13-07-2018T01:04:21,Mihari,She does XD
13-07-2018T01:04:50,FluffKevlar,"I think Aura is the fluffiest OC i know, yes"
13-07-2018T01:04:57,FluffKevlar,"or at least, well, the tail"
13-07-2018T01:04:59,Dadrobit,That's gotta be an impressive amount
13-07-2018T01:05:01,Bgrmystr2,It's the FLOOF! :ptv-shock:
13-07-2018T01:05:02,FluffKevlar,does tail = whole character?

13-07-2018T01:05:05,Mihari,Sometimes
13-07-2018T01:05:11,Bgrmystr2,We were just talking about you earlier!

13-07-2018T01:05:14,Ordithus,Kat was pretty fluffy... once https://www.patreon.com/posts/fluffy-kat-13925253
13-07-2018T01:05:26,Mihari,I would say accelo is a close second?
13-07-2018T01:05:49,ZRO4825,"Accelo is pretty damned floofy, aye."
13-07-2018T01:06:02,Bgrmystr2,Kiwi's phone didn't automatically autocorrect birb to fluff.
13-07-2018T01:06:15,Bgrmystr2,and we couldn't figure out why D:
13-07-2018T01:06:16,Dadrobit,Fail?

13-07-2018T01:07:28,Cyborgthree,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
13-07-2018T01:08:34,Pimsan,A bit off topic here. But have anyone seen the Deadpool The Musical 2 where in this video he sings Disney songs in his own lyrics?
13-07-2018T01:08:45,RimaDraws,maybe idk
13-07-2018T01:08:45,Cyborgthree,no
13-07-2018T01:08:58,Cyborgthree,but i will now at somepoint
13-07-2018T01:09:09,Pimsan,"Well, i have the link of the video here. So it is okay if i put it here?"

13-07-2018T01:09:46,Mihari,"Ummm, unless someone wants to see it, I'd say no."
13-07-2018T01:10:00,Mihari,And by someone I mean more than 2 people.

13-07-2018T02:02:55,Dadrobit,"Though, to be honest, I am having a hard time concentrating on the letters, so two was probably enough."
13-07-2018T02:03:10,Dadrobit,"Like, putting the letters together."
13-07-2018T02:03:11,unsteddyphoenix,Two packages...
13-07-2018T02:03:20,unsteddyphoenix,I have no frame of reference for how much that is :thinking:
13-07-2018T02:04:34,Dadrobit,"A goodly amount, unsteddy, a proper amount even."
13-07-2018T02:04:50,unsteddyphoenix,a proper goodly amount even

13-07-2018T02:06:21,Dadrobit,"Nah, this is just pure THC. No kush to be found there."
13-07-2018T02:07:11,Dadrobit,Kush references a more specified variety of the actual plant. Usually a sedative.
13-07-2018T02:07:44,unsteddyphoenix,Oh. Huh.
13-07-2018T02:08:01,unsteddyphoenix,This is news to me
13-07-2018T02:08:25,Dadrobit,"Like, OG Kush or Bubba Kush. Very relaxing stuff. Also liable to put a smile on one's face."
13-07-2018T02:09:07,TheBeckoner,Hello frens

13-07-2018T02:13:23,Dadrobit,It's what some people want. Just to relax completely and utterly.
13-07-2018T02:14:12,Dadrobit,Just euphoric relaxation on the couch eating waffles watching FLCL.
13-07-2018T02:14:14,Bgrmystr2,"what day is it, Sage"
13-07-2018T02:14:22,Bgrmystr2,I might actually miss it
13-07-2018T02:14:23,unsteddyphoenix,oh yeah~
13-07-2018T02:14:38,TheBeckoner,relaxing is nice i generally dislike the feeling weed gives tho makes me feel out of control over myself
13-07-2018T02:14:58,SageSaga,July 28th
13-07-2018T02:15:05,Bgrmystr2,Ow
13-07-2018T02:15:11,Bgrmystr2,that's painful. I'm not gonna be here.

13-07-2018T02:15:20,unsteddyphoenix,D:
13-07-2018T02:15:35,Bgrmystr2,I'll bring laptop though
13-07-2018T02:15:44,Dadrobit,What strains were you trying? Some do have an effect of paranoia and unease.
13-07-2018T02:15:52,Bgrmystr2,I should be able to make it to the friday stream.
13-07-2018T02:15:59,Bgrmystr2,maybe sometime in the middle of it
13-07-2018T02:16:28,TheBeckoner,I'd have to ask my friend. He told me but it was a while back.
13-07-2018T02:16:52,TheBeckoner,I wanna say it was purple something
13-07-2018T02:18:26,Dadrobit,Maybe try something like AK-47? It's very relaxing and leaves you rather completely alert.
13-07-2018T02:18:47,unsteddyphoenix,Ak-47...relaxing...
13-07-2018T02:19:06,FenceEqualizer,Tom going to become an old boy.
13-07-2018T02:19:29,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it's got kind of an intimidating name for a mellow strain."
13-07-2018T02:19:50,Dadrobit,"Well, not exactly ""mellow"" but you get me."
13-07-2018T02:19:54,FenceEqualizer,Also Sage I know I am super late but thanks for introducing me to Tanya the evil. Anime rekindle my want for old timey war anime

13-07-2018T02:20:20,unsteddyphoenix,Im having a great time with it lol
13-07-2018T02:20:24,Bgrmystr2,it's on my list of things to watch though

13-07-2018T02:20:58,FenceEqualizer,Its good bgr. Dooo it
13-07-2018T02:21:06,TheBeckoner,I'll see what he can get me. Hes pretty good about that sorta stuff. well as good as you can be with it being illegal in this particular place
13-07-2018T02:21:09,unsteddyphoenix,Nothing scary about little girls and nazis
13-07-2018T02:21:12,Dadrobit,"Ohhhh, War anime? Watch Violet Evergarden"

13-07-2018T02:21:34,Dadrobit,"Oh man, it's still a no-no there? Sad mate."
13-07-2018T02:21:47,unsteddyphoenix,I hate a tab with that anime open. but I didnt remember where it came from

13-07-2018T02:22:51,Dadrobit,"Fence, it's about a double amputee girl. So she does have prosthetics."
13-07-2018T02:22:54,SageSaga,new show started- i havent watched it yet but if it follows the Manga- it's traaaaash

13-07-2018T02:24:45,TheBeckoner,yeah still illegal. But im thinking it wont be long before the ban is lifted overall.
13-07-2018T02:24:54,SageSaga,How Not to Summon a Demon Lord
13-07-2018T02:25:14,Dadrobit,Technically it's illegal here in AZ as well. But it's also super easy to get a card nowadays.

13-07-2018T02:27:05,Bgrmystr2,ah yeah that anime sage
13-07-2018T02:27:12,FenceEqualizer,My backburner is filling up
13-07-2018T02:27:24,Bgrmystr2,"I noticed it earlier, and I added it to my list to look into already"

13-07-2018T02:27:47,TheBeckoner,lol yeah we have no system in place for it at all. Most everyone is ok with it tho. I rarely encounter someone anti-420
13-07-2018T02:28:09,SageSaga,I told Tom about it while i was reading it - the dialogue was so bad
13-07-2018T02:28:25,Dadrobit,My little brother is actually against it. It's odd.

13-07-2018T02:29:59,Bgrmystr2,I've heard that before

13-07-2018T02:30:45,SageSaga,it was from this anime- i may have mentioned it before about the Manga
13-07-2018T02:31:01,Bgrmystr2,hm maybe
13-07-2018T02:31:33,TheBeckoner,Yeah now that I say that a friend of mine is against it. hes among few that i know. He takes it way to seriously imo. Thinks its a crutch or a way to fill a deeper void.
13-07-2018T02:31:39,TheBeckoner,too much thought into it imo
13-07-2018T02:31:56,Bgrmystr2,"he thinks what's a crutch, Beck?"

13-07-2018T02:32:52,Dadrobit,He didn't even take things like Tylenol for the longest time.
13-07-2018T02:33:11,Dadrobit,"Like, he was weirdly anti-medicine for the longest time."
13-07-2018T02:33:22,Bgrmystr2,"Some people just want to relax, and that's fine, I dunno if it's weed-demanding, but I dunno. if ppl wanna blaze it, then by all means 420"

13-07-2018T02:34:21,Bgrmystr2,"so.. about eleven longs, dadro?"
13-07-2018T02:34:24,Bgrmystr2,or is that too many?

13-07-2018T02:34:55,Dadrobit,Probably just a side effect of his aspergers.
13-07-2018T02:35:05,TheBeckoner,"My ex is sorta that way. She became drug dependent i think. Maybe be better now, not sure"
13-07-2018T02:35:06,Dadrobit,More like 23 longs
13-07-2018T02:35:12,Bgrmystr2,wow
13-07-2018T02:35:19,Bgrmystr2,that is quite long
13-07-2018T02:35:35,TheBeckoner,how is long?
13-07-2018T02:35:38,Dadrobit,legitimately wouldn't touch meds unless it was an absolute emergency until he was well into adulthood.
13-07-2018T02:35:43,Bgrmystr2,"long is long, beck"
13-07-2018T02:35:50,TheBeckoner,I am a fool
13-07-2018T02:35:56,TheBeckoner,of course

13-07-2018T02:36:13,TheBeckoner,I h a t e this keyboard
13-07-2018T02:36:22,Bgrmystr2,know that feel
13-07-2018T02:36:47,TheBeckoner,"the fuckin ""W"" key keeps coming undone"
13-07-2018T02:36:56,TheBeckoner,worst thing in games of any kind
13-07-2018T02:37:03,Xexanoth,time for a new keyboard?
13-07-2018T02:37:12,TheBeckoner,Pretty much lose my mind when it happens
13-07-2018T02:37:14,TheBeckoner,yes
13-07-2018T02:37:26,Dadrobit,Who needs to move forward? Strafing only to show off mad skilz
13-07-2018T02:37:56,SageSaga,. . .
13-07-2018T02:38:13,TheBeckoner,if I run backwards my back is never towards the enemy and if they are behind me I cant see them so it doesnt matter
13-07-2018T02:38:20,TheBeckoner,ez
13-07-2018T02:38:29,SageSaga,did anyone prove you moved faster in Legend of Zelda Ocarina of time by rolling?
13-07-2018T02:38:47,TheBeckoner,It feels faster
13-07-2018T02:38:55,Dadrobit,"Played a game called Dust 514 for the longest time that had a bug where if you sprinted sideways using the DS3 and simultaneously used a keyboard to do the same at the same time, it counted both and doubled your sprint speed going sideways."
13-07-2018T02:39:22,TheBeckoner,thats how running was made
13-07-2018T02:39:27,Xexanoth,^
13-07-2018T02:39:29,Dadrobit,It was rather situationally useful.
13-07-2018T02:39:32,TheBeckoner,someone tried walking twice at the same time
13-07-2018T02:39:38,Dadrobit,LOL
13-07-2018T02:39:50,TheBeckoner,I stole that btw
13-07-2018T02:39:52,Xexanoth,"also, wasn't the whole rolling thing or jumping in mario just because normal walking was boring?"
13-07-2018T02:39:52,Dadrobit,ohsit thats funny
13-07-2018T02:39:57,TheBeckoner,will feel bad if dont say
13-07-2018T02:40:17,Dadrobit,who was the author?
13-07-2018T02:40:27,TheBeckoner,of the thing I said?
13-07-2018T02:40:44,Dadrobit,Almost sounds like Mitch Hedberg
13-07-2018T02:40:47,Dadrobit,yeah
13-07-2018T02:40:54,FenceEqualizer,You know someone strafing at you in the speed of sound is a actually kinda terrifying
13-07-2018T02:41:06,TheBeckoner,I can't remember. I think it was a weird edited picture I saw on instagram
13-07-2018T02:41:11,TheBeckoner,maybe tumblr
13-07-2018T02:41:59,TheBeckoner,Hey can I link a tweet?
13-07-2018T02:42:09,TheBeckoner,its to the running thing
13-07-2018T02:42:11,SageSaga,of?
13-07-2018T02:42:20,TheBeckoner,the walking twice joke thing
13-07-2018T02:42:28,SageSaga,sure
13-07-2018T02:42:31,Dadrobit,"It was useful in corporation battles. You'd have a sprint equipped member be the only person spawn, they'd Usain Bolt their way to a point, hack it, and then the whole team would span on the captured point at once."

13-07-2018T02:42:38,TheBeckoner,thank
13-07-2018T02:42:46,Xexanoth,"it's a meme, ""x invented y when he tried to do z twice at the same time"""
13-07-2018T02:42:56,Dadrobit,Solid meme
13-07-2018T02:43:26,TheBeckoner,yeah it was in style for a bit
13-07-2018T02:43:30,TheBeckoner,like a year ago
13-07-2018T02:43:39,Dadrobit,Their sprint speed would be such that it was faster than even calling in a dropship or LAV to carry the team to the point.
13-07-2018T02:44:12,Dadrobit,I almost miss that buggy-ass game.
13-07-2018T02:44:14,Dadrobit,Almost
13-07-2018T02:44:26,DarthRexKing,Goodnight.

13-07-2018T02:45:07,TheBeckoner,Just cause two was good when it would glitch. Flying boats into infinity was the best.
13-07-2018T02:45:13,DarthRexKing,And I remember Dust 514. It was attached to Eve ONline.
13-07-2018T02:45:17,DarthRexKing,Whatever happened to it?
13-07-2018T02:45:28,Dadrobit,CCP killed the servers a while ago
13-07-2018T02:45:44,DarthRexKing,Ah. :V A shame. Looked like it had potential.
13-07-2018T02:46:05,Dadrobit,I wasn't even really playing the game by the end. I just sat in open squads and said stuff to people for money.
13-07-2018T02:46:14,DarthRexKing,Lol.
13-07-2018T02:46:18,DarthRexKing,Well goodnight people/
13-07-2018T02:46:34,TheBeckoner,Kinda like what you do now Robit
13-07-2018T02:46:52,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it was a big inspiration for actually getting into voice acting."
13-07-2018T02:47:54,Dadrobit,Gave me a lot of confidence when I was getting regulars and sitting on piles of money just for reading bad fanfics and pickup lines.
13-07-2018T02:49:31,Bgrmystr2,gnight rex
13-07-2018T02:50:01,KamikageX4,"I've been trying to get into VA, any tips?"
13-07-2018T02:50:37,Dadrobit,"Get used to being told ""No"" if you haven't already lol"
13-07-2018T02:50:49,KamikageX4,Noted.
13-07-2018T02:51:30,Dadrobit,"Seriously, you will go days and days where you're putting yourself out there nonstop, and still get nothing out of it."
13-07-2018T02:51:49,Dadrobit,You really need to be strong willed
13-07-2018T02:51:56,Dadrobit,And have a surplus of ramen
13-07-2018T02:51:57,KamikageX4,I've heard that a lot.
13-07-2018T02:52:02,TheBeckoner,Man I gotta drive like 15 hours sunday. gonna suck
13-07-2018T02:52:35,Dadrobit,"Also, don't focus your early money on the mic, spend it on treating your recording environment."
13-07-2018T02:53:05,Dadrobit,Even a Neuman sounds like garbage if you're recording on your desk next to a computer with your AC on.
13-07-2018T02:53:06,KamikageX4,"Sitting in a plane for 12 hours with breaks is a nightmare, can't imagine driving 15 would be any more fun."
13-07-2018T02:53:26,KamikageX4,I have a recording environment thanks to my family's recording studio.
13-07-2018T02:53:28,Dadrobit,(I like long road trips)
13-07-2018T02:53:34,Dadrobit,Oh? No shit?

13-07-2018T02:54:01,TheBeckoner,well
13-07-2018T02:54:21,TheBeckoner,"I should have said ""Im being driven 15 hours sunday"""
13-07-2018T02:54:38,Dadrobit,Greyhound? Or family/friends?
13-07-2018T02:54:44,TheBeckoner,the latter
13-07-2018T02:54:52,KamikageX4,"Against The Grain.  Australian music and miscellaneous recordings, if you're lucky music videos are a possibility."
13-07-2018T02:55:00,Bgrmystr2,"oh, speaking of microphones, gonna be getting myself one sometime next month after the convention is over"
13-07-2018T02:55:01,TheBeckoner,vacation-ish deal to North Carolina
13-07-2018T02:55:22,Dadrobit,"Also, Kam, take vocal lessons. Learning how to not just use your voice, but to protect it is straight up mandatory."
13-07-2018T02:55:45,Bgrmystr2,the Shure Beta 98H/C
13-07-2018T02:55:49,Bgrmystr2,fairly excite
13-07-2018T02:56:00,KamikageX4,Got it.  I have people to go to for that.
13-07-2018T02:56:19,KamikageX4,Shure?
13-07-2018T02:56:25,Dadrobit,I do mine at the local college. It's actually nuts how much more sustain I have for sessions now compared to where I was before.
13-07-2018T02:56:27,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, shure makes good mics"
13-07-2018T02:56:32,TheBeckoner,Im basic so I have a blue yeti
13-07-2018T02:56:33,Dadrobit,Shure = Quality
13-07-2018T02:56:45,KamikageX4,Nice.
13-07-2018T02:56:55,Bgrmystr2,the mic I'm getting is a clip-on that's gonna go directly on my sax
13-07-2018T02:56:57,Dadrobit,Anything over $100 by them is guaranteed to be good for its intended purpose.
13-07-2018T02:57:06,Bgrmystr2,and it's got the extra audio range for the horn too
13-07-2018T02:57:22,KamikageX4,Sounds pretty swish.
13-07-2018T02:57:25,Bgrmystr2,"the one I'm getting is gonna be $210, yeh"
13-07-2018T02:57:53,KamikageX4,Is this the Nier: Automata soundtrack?
13-07-2018T02:57:55,TheBeckoner,laptop mic is best mic
13-07-2018T02:57:59,Dadrobit,"I personally don't have any of their mics, but I do use one of their monitor headphones.  SRH840's."
13-07-2018T02:58:05,Bgrmystr2,"make sure not to put all your eggs in one basket when buying hardware, Kami"
13-07-2018T02:58:33,Bgrmystr2,"Quality always matters, but a lot goes into audio recording, a lot more than I know of"
13-07-2018T02:58:35,KamikageX4,I am like a megajew when it comes to money.
13-07-2018T02:58:44,TheBeckoner,hah
13-07-2018T02:59:20,Dadrobit,"Maybe go for the Focusrite solo or duo preamps. Inexpensive, but very clean for mics that don't require a ton of gain."
13-07-2018T02:59:55,Dadrobit,"Actually, I do have a Shure mic now that I think lol. SM7B actually."
13-07-2018T03:00:31,Dadrobit,"But I don't run it on my Scarlett, not enough gain. I have an ISA One for that specific mic."
13-07-2018T03:00:38,KamikageX4,Check out Dead Smoke by Dyssidia on YouTube.
13-07-2018T03:01:46,KamikageX4,"It was filmed in our studio while it was under construction, and I make an appearance."
13-07-2018T03:02:04,TheBeckoner,Alright well I gotta get to bed. Got a lot of stuff to prepare. Night y'all.
13-07-2018T03:02:20,TheBeckoner,to prepare tomorrow*

13-07-2018T03:03:08,KamikageX4,おやすみなさい。
13-07-2018T03:03:11,Dadrobit,So I'm assuming you're just going to use the equipment on site?
13-07-2018T03:03:24,KamikageX4,Pretty much.
13-07-2018T03:03:29,Bgrmystr2,"wish I had a studio to record in, but the mic I'm getting is severely directional, so it *should*... be okay"
13-07-2018T03:04:48,Dadrobit,"For VA, you're going to generally want a large diaphragm condenser mic in a cardioid or some variation of cardioid pattern."
13-07-2018T03:05:14,Dadrobit,"As in, no figure 8 or omnidirectional mics."
13-07-2018T03:05:59,KamikageX4,"I'm gonna assume that means ""the stuff I see professionals like David Hayter using"""
13-07-2018T03:06:25,Dadrobit,David Hayter is using something like a Neumann U87. Good luck

13-07-2018T03:09:22,KamikageX4,"I'm gonna need to get back on task, hope I see ya 'round sometime."
13-07-2018T03:10:05,KamikageX4,I don't usually use Picarto because it cuts out and stutters a lot.  Probably just the Australian internet.
13-07-2018T03:10:10,Dadrobit,"I mean, there are plenty of affordable options, but the thing you're looking for is generalized as a large diaphragm condenser mic."
13-07-2018T03:10:28,Dadrobit,"Nah, I'm having issues tonight as well right here in the Americas."
13-07-2018T03:10:39,Dadrobit,"Ah, have a good one then Kam."
13-07-2018T03:10:51,KamikageX4,"You too, Robit."

13-07-2018T14:13:29,LannAF,Yooo
13-07-2018T14:13:39,SpazztasticKiwi,It just hit me the innuendo of “Enter Natani”
13-07-2018T14:14:24,LannAF,How goes?
13-07-2018T14:15:08,SageSaga,yo Lann
13-07-2018T14:15:20,LannAF,Hiya Sage :D
13-07-2018T14:16:51,Twokinds,YO LANNN!!!
13-07-2018T14:17:44,LannAF,YO TOMM!!!
13-07-2018T14:20:01,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s like high school all over again
13-07-2018T14:20:21,SpazztasticKiwi,“You saw each other yesterday stop screaming”
13-07-2018T14:20:54,LannAF,I feel like I should do this next friday
13-07-2018T14:20:59,LannAF,do that*
13-07-2018T14:21:20,LannAF,"btw, hey sage"
13-07-2018T14:21:27,LannAF,You ever watched an anime called Oban Star Racers?
13-07-2018T14:22:40,SageSaga,nope
13-07-2018T14:23:14,LannAF,okie dokes
13-07-2018T14:23:30,Pimsan,I watch it.
13-07-2018T14:23:55,SageSaga,"""Tom!"" ""Who are you?"" ""It's me!  ***!"" ""Who?"" ""Lann?"" ""LANN!"""
13-07-2018T14:24:08,LannAF,......I feel like that would actually happen xD
13-07-2018T14:26:38,Twokinds,I already forgot what your real name was again.
13-07-2018T14:27:06,LannAF,"Good, it's my only weakness"
13-07-2018T14:27:54,TorqueEmUp,"""Enter Natani"" Yeah, gotta save that one for late. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
13-07-2018T14:27:58,TorqueEmUp,later*
13-07-2018T14:29:02,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-sleepy: gmornin
13-07-2018T14:29:14,LannAF,Heya Bgr!
13-07-2018T14:29:36,TorqueEmUp,I'll see myself out after that one. :P
13-07-2018T14:29:50,LannAF,In all honesty I'd rather Lann than my real name in a non-professional setting
13-07-2018T14:30:46,SpazztasticKiwi,My actual name is what I’m ever really called
13-07-2018T14:31:12,SpazztasticKiwi,But Kiwi is an option too
13-07-2018T14:31:33,BadFoMo,Yo.
13-07-2018T14:31:40,LannAF,I know like
13-07-2018T14:31:43,LannAF,3 people called Kiwi
13-07-2018T14:31:47,LannAF,Hello Bad
13-07-2018T14:31:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"With the amount of times my mom calls my sister’s name instead of mine, I react to her name too"
13-07-2018T14:31:56,Bgrmystr2,"well.. that new page is certainly not quite what I expected tom, but nicely done"
13-07-2018T14:32:27,TorqueEmUp,indeed
13-07-2018T14:34:36,Pimsan,I'm more curious about how the situation with the space man heading.
13-07-2018T14:36:40,Bgrmystr2,they have Kaylin.
13-07-2018T14:36:43,Bgrmystr2,they'll be fine.
13-07-2018T14:37:39,Pimsan,"Maybe, but it kinda depend on how Sage is going with this. For all we know, a demon will come out of nowhere and swallow the dude whole and go back to where it belong."
13-07-2018T14:38:20,Bgrmystr2,maybe. but does that stop kaylin and nyna from bringing the old guy to where he needs to go? nawh.
13-07-2018T14:38:42,TorqueEmUp,"Well I am going to go and work, so you all have a wonderful day."
13-07-2018T14:38:47,Pimsan,Later.
13-07-2018T14:38:55,TorqueEmUp,o/
13-07-2018T14:38:56,Bgrmystr2,seeya later Torque
13-07-2018T14:39:21,SageSaga,The old man has reached his destination...
13-07-2018T14:39:44,Bgrmystr2,Final Destination...? :ptv-wondering:
13-07-2018T14:39:55,LannAF,Cya Torque!
13-07-2018T14:40:04,SageSaga,remember what they were looking for?
13-07-2018T14:40:31,Bgrmystr2,"mm, a meteor of some type, maybe you posted a page and I missed it"
13-07-2018T14:40:49,FoxxTrotter,:cfoxxtrotter-Star: &lt;&lt; One of these.
13-07-2018T14:41:05,Bgrmystr2,ah the one you did last week I missed reading it XD
13-07-2018T14:41:06,SageSaga,and now they found a man from space...
13-07-2018T14:42:44,Bgrmystr2,"okay, just caught up with the last page, yeah I see what happened"
13-07-2018T14:43:04,Pimsan,And this is the moment where someone is going to put a 'SPPPAAACCCEEES!' meme here.
13-07-2018T14:43:28,Bgrmystr2,Spaaaaaaaaaaace
13-07-2018T14:44:06,SageSaga,well that was a self fulfilling prophecy
13-07-2018T14:44:53,BadFoMo,"""I'm proud of you, son."" ""Dad?! Are you Space?!"" ""Yes. Now we are a family again."""
13-07-2018T14:46:46,Bgrmystr2,"what sage said is true. I wasn't actually thinking about doing it till you said it, Pimsan"
13-07-2018T14:46:52,Bgrmystr2,so I did.
13-07-2018T14:49:54,ZRO4825,Good job :P
13-07-2018T14:50:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a kitten with a bad case of the snuggles
13-07-2018T14:50:28,ZRO4825,&lt;3 !
13-07-2018T14:51:00,Pimsan,LOL!
13-07-2018T14:52:05,LannAF,can that be me
13-07-2018T14:52:12,LannAF,I want kitten snuggles :C
13-07-2018T14:52:16,Bgrmystr2,"are you a cat, Lann?"
13-07-2018T14:52:27,Bgrmystr2,"cuz if so, you could BE kitten snuggles."
13-07-2018T14:52:31,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-ohmy:
13-07-2018T14:52:41,LannAF,....I was going to make a pun
13-07-2018T14:52:45,LittlePearl,:ptv-scilove:
13-07-2018T14:52:48,LannAF,But I'm pretty sure I'd be burned
13-07-2018T14:52:50,LannAF,at the stake
13-07-2018T14:53:05,LannAF,"nah, I'd rather be a fox if anything"
13-07-2018T14:53:07,LannAF,Cute little fuckers
13-07-2018T14:53:44,Pimsan,Or you can be a hybrid. Like you can be a fox/cat furry.
13-07-2018T14:53:47,LittlePearl,:ptv-excited:
13-07-2018T14:53:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"If it’s the pun I feel you’re thinking of, yes. Refrain yourself"
13-07-2018T14:54:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Though these kittens are up for adoption
13-07-2018T14:54:25,LannAF,eh
13-07-2018T14:54:58,LannAF,"I don't really have an anthro character, I just use my Aurin from Wildstar"
13-07-2018T14:55:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I just KNOW Tom wants another kitten
13-07-2018T14:55:03,LannAF,Though I guess that counts as Cat
13-07-2018T14:56:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Sherbet likes to eat hair
13-07-2018T14:56:19,SpazztasticKiwi,*Sherbert
13-07-2018T14:56:25,BadFoMo,...Wat?
13-07-2018T14:56:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Sherbert’s the orange tabby kitten
13-07-2018T14:58:15,BadFoMo,I figered that much. Why are they eating hair?
13-07-2018T14:58:40,SageSaga,you said orange tabby which reminded me to remove Nekonny
13-07-2018T14:59:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t know why he eats hair
13-07-2018T14:59:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Can’t exactly ask him
13-07-2018T14:59:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Though he more chews and grooms on the hair than eats it
13-07-2018T15:00:22,Rosscoe,Hooooi!
13-07-2018T15:00:38,BadFoMo,Oh. ...And here I was going to make a Vore joke.
13-07-2018T15:00:44,BadFoMo,"Also, Hi."
13-07-2018T15:00:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Poor Neko
13-07-2018T15:01:05,Pimsan,That's quite a blow.
13-07-2018T15:01:12,Bgrmystr2,hey Ross
13-07-2018T15:01:24,LannAF,Heya Ross
13-07-2018T15:01:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Also that sounds like a trip of a comic Sage
13-07-2018T15:02:22,SageSaga,eh?
13-07-2018T15:02:46,SpazztasticKiwi,What they were talking about earlier
13-07-2018T15:03:11,SageSaga,the comic that im working on right now on stream?
13-07-2018T15:03:23,SpazztasticKiwi,That’d be my guess
13-07-2018T15:03:47,SageSaga,have you not read it?
13-07-2018T15:04:03,Rosscoe,So hows everyone today?
13-07-2018T15:04:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Well I’ve gone to one of your pages before and tried checking it out
13-07-2018T15:04:43,SpazztasticKiwi,But got distracted and ended up putting it back down shortly after
13-07-2018T15:05:06,LannAF,I'm doing alright Ross!
13-07-2018T15:06:09,BadFoMo,I'm fine. You?
13-07-2018T15:06:23,SpazztasticKiwi,And promptly forgot about going back. Not because I got bored or didn’t find it interesting but because I was like “did I turn the water off?”
13-07-2018T15:07:06,Rosscoe,"tired, least I can eat a normal meal is hfor now"
13-07-2018T15:07:47,SpazztasticKiwi,That reminds me I was gonna fix some tea
13-07-2018T15:07:50,Bgrmystr2,"well Kiwi, the one Sage is working on is Artificial Incident"
13-07-2018T15:07:55,Bgrmystr2,and it's not long yet
13-07-2018T15:08:04,Bgrmystr2,plus it's a fairly good read
13-07-2018T15:08:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t doubt it
13-07-2018T15:08:24,BadFoMo,@Rosscoe What happened?
13-07-2018T15:08:34,Bgrmystr2,it wouldn't take much for you to roll right through it
13-07-2018T15:08:47,SpazztasticKiwi,His characters do seem to have rather impressive...attributes
13-07-2018T15:09:54,Rosscoe,@BadFoMo just another busy work week that turned into more hours of work then sleep ratio XD
13-07-2018T15:10:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Do note I’m actually talking about things like the hair colors and not the boobs
13-07-2018T15:10:41,SageSaga,Nyna barely has boobs
13-07-2018T15:11:03,BadFoMo,"Ah, good. It sounded like you just got out of the Hospital."
13-07-2018T15:11:06,Bgrmystr2,"so you're saying the boobs aren't impressive attributes? Y'know, when someone has em"
13-07-2018T15:11:17,SpazztasticKiwi,They’re nice yeah
13-07-2018T15:11:40,Bgrmystr2,HM okay
13-07-2018T15:11:42,SpazztasticKiwi,But do you know a professional way to say “nice chesticles”
13-07-2018T15:11:53,SpazztasticKiwi,“Cool boobs”
13-07-2018T15:11:57,Bgrmystr2,why does it need to be professional tho lol
13-07-2018T15:12:08,SpazztasticKiwi,So you don’t sound creepy
13-07-2018T15:12:21,Bgrmystr2,"Kiwi, it's gonna sound creepy no matter who says it in what way"
13-07-2018T15:12:30,Bgrmystr2,there's no escaping
13-07-2018T15:15:20,Twokinds,Those leaves look good!
13-07-2018T15:15:56,Bgrmystr2,"they look like leaves, yes"
13-07-2018T15:16:01,Bgrmystr2,so far so good
13-07-2018T15:16:23,LannAF,delicious leaves
13-07-2018T15:16:24,LannAF,let me eat them
13-07-2018T15:16:40,Bgrmystr2,uh.. you.. go right for it
13-07-2018T15:20:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I want that shirt
13-07-2018T15:20:50,SpazztasticKiwi,If it fit
13-07-2018T15:27:07,Rosscoe,Speaking of shirts...
13-07-2018T15:27:54,Rosscoe,"I would custom order a T-Shirt with Nyan's faceless face on it, you know you just see the hair, ears, and a spilt tail, that be it on the tshirt"
13-07-2018T15:28:14,SageSaga,Nyna
13-07-2018T15:29:15,SageSaga,wouldnt you rather have a Nyna Daki?
13-07-2018T15:29:21,Bgrmystr2,"with no face, Ross?"
13-07-2018T15:29:28,Bgrmystr2,that seems kinda creepy
13-07-2018T15:30:39,CrRAR,just toss a ditto face on 'er.
13-07-2018T15:30:41,Pimsan,Nyna Daki? What's that?
13-07-2018T15:30:45,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
13-07-2018T15:30:55,Bgrmystr2,"Pimsan, a Dakimakura"
13-07-2018T15:31:07,SageSaga,i think when he says Faceless he means like this - http://overwatch.blizzplanet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/hanzo-spray-11-spray.png
13-07-2018T15:31:20,Bgrmystr2,they're long pillows sometimes w/ characters on them
13-07-2018T15:31:39,Bgrmystr2,wtf kinda.. yeah that's weird sage xD
13-07-2018T15:31:54,SageSaga,not really
13-07-2018T15:32:29,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, all that's there is hair and beard. Weird, yo."
13-07-2018T15:32:38,SageSaga,it's a common style for design - to take some of the more solid aspects of a character and simplify it for a style
13-07-2018T15:32:40,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s kinda cool
13-07-2018T15:33:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Nice design for a button pin
13-07-2018T15:33:12,CrRAR,"ohhh, yeah like using negative space as a style."
13-07-2018T15:33:15,Bgrmystr2,"yeh kiwi, it is kinda cool but it's still weird."
13-07-2018T15:33:17,Rosscoe,"A Nyna body pillow? I dont think so, having a C2 3D mouse pad is already strange enough XD"
13-07-2018T15:33:38,Pimsan,Ah!
13-07-2018T15:33:43,Bgrmystr2,"Ross, you've already passed the weird level"
13-07-2018T15:33:45,SageSaga,i have a Rem pillow and a Mihari pillow
13-07-2018T15:34:15,Bgrmystr2,lol a mihari one..?
13-07-2018T15:34:17,Azukyee,nice boobs
13-07-2018T15:34:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Mihari pillow?
13-07-2018T15:34:30,SageSaga,yep
13-07-2018T15:34:32,Bgrmystr2,"well, yeah I guess some ppl have probably made them."
13-07-2018T15:34:39,Rosscoe,I havent found much in terms of geeky girls to date that would get the jokes behind the body pillows so I rather avoid having something like that while I search for love XD
13-07-2018T15:34:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Like a pillow with the design or with the character
13-07-2018T15:35:05,Bgrmystr2,"Ross, try anime conventions"
13-07-2018T15:35:09,Bgrmystr2,"also, you would be surprised"
13-07-2018T15:35:14,LannAF,Wait
13-07-2018T15:35:20,LannAF,Are you talking about the one Sticky helped you pick Sage?
13-07-2018T15:35:44,Bgrmystr2,even normal people can see the joke if properly inducted
13-07-2018T15:35:54,LannAF,Sticky totally wants a body pillow of one of the dragon maid characters
13-07-2018T15:36:00,LannAF,best geeky gf
13-07-2018T15:36:06,Rosscoe,"I live in Canada's feather of the Americas hat, not much that I know of for convetions out here aside from the one Steirling mentioned some time ago but thats a furcon of sorts"
13-07-2018T15:36:26,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s girls there too
13-07-2018T15:36:32,Bgrmystr2,lol that'd be good stuff Lann
13-07-2018T15:36:48,SpazztasticKiwi,We’re not endangered species you know
13-07-2018T15:37:00,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: you aren't?!
13-07-2018T15:37:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Nope
13-07-2018T15:37:18,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s lots of us
13-07-2018T15:37:37,SpazztasticKiwi,(We’re just really really good at hiding)
13-07-2018T15:37:55,SpazztasticKiwi,But shhhh don’t tell anyone
13-07-2018T15:38:02,Rosscoe,"A girl that I use to work with, all her friends look like super models, but they meet up two to three times a week to play magic the gathering"
13-07-2018T15:38:14,LannAF,they're just norm people
13-07-2018T15:38:24,LannAF,I met mine teaching her to play a class in an MMO
13-07-2018T15:38:31,Bgrmystr2,see Ross
13-07-2018T15:38:37,Rosscoe,"I kidna had a thing for her too, she was a single mom, little younger then me but I wanted to move and I didnt want to start another relationship"
13-07-2018T15:38:48,Rosscoe,Now im in the atlianic and all teh country girls want to be city girls
13-07-2018T15:38:56,Bgrmystr2,well duh
13-07-2018T15:39:05,SageSaga,https://twitter.com/Paw_To_Press/status/964863505282211840
13-07-2018T15:39:05,Bgrmystr2,and city girls wanna see the countryside
13-07-2018T15:39:11,SageSaga,Mihari Daki
13-07-2018T15:39:26,LannAF,That's a really high quality pic O_o
13-07-2018T15:39:28,Bgrmystr2,ah
13-07-2018T15:39:37,LannAF,I'd feel weird having Mihari's character next to me
13-07-2018T15:39:46,Rosscoe,"City girls dont lasta day with me,"
13-07-2018T15:39:49,LannAF,and I feel like she wouldn't want me to either xD
13-07-2018T15:39:56,Bgrmystr2,Mihari doesn't find dakis of her persona creepy enough to not allow it? :o
13-07-2018T15:40:01,Bgrmystr2,seems kinda odd
13-07-2018T15:40:27,SageSaga,the artist that did this is a close friend of Miharis and has her permission
13-07-2018T15:40:40,Bgrmystr2,hm
13-07-2018T15:40:49,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s what you meant
13-07-2018T15:41:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Niiiice :ptv-dealwithit:
13-07-2018T15:41:12,Bgrmystr2,"no less odd, but interesting nonetheless."
13-07-2018T15:41:14,BadFoMo,...What if Mihari got one of thoes?

13-07-2018T16:44:52,BadFoMo,@Bgrmystr2 It looked weird when I thought the space between the skirt and Clovis' right leg was the right leg.

13-07-2018T18:25:00,Bgrmystr2,rofl xex
13-07-2018T18:25:08,TheFDdriver,whats the notebook for?
13-07-2018T18:25:09,McClaw,"If you've got a vector image, you can up-scale before converting to JPG or PNG (or whatever your preferred vendor wants)."
13-07-2018T18:25:44,CrRAR,"haha, 'least it wasn't Ron Stoppable."
13-07-2018T18:25:53,Bgrmystr2,so I take that as a no then :u
13-07-2018T18:26:22,Bgrmystr2,cuz there's websites that exist that upscale using vectors
13-07-2018T18:26:27,Bgrmystr2,and they can upscale JPGs
13-07-2018T18:26:29,Vexd,Nora wants another child
13-07-2018T18:26:39,Bgrmystr2,and it's not pixelated
13-07-2018T18:26:59,Xexanoth,vector upscaling = upscaling without quality loss (for easy understanding)
13-07-2018T18:27:12,McClaw,"And that's conversion from pixel to vector, which isn't perfect."
13-07-2018T18:27:15,Bgrmystr2,"in fact, you can upload pixel art to those sites and they do a damn good job at making it look like it wasn't pixel art"
