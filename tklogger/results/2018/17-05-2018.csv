17-05-2018T16:36:43,SiliconCarbide,it was just three dots
17-05-2018T16:37:06,Bgrmystr2,"he has never said anything else. literally ever, that I've been here."
17-05-2018T16:38:56,SiliconCarbide,really? i could swear i saw him commenting during streams

17-05-2018T16:53:15,SiliconCarbide,"i know im repeating myself here, but i so sure i saw him commenting during streams... or maybe im imagining things now, who knows"
17-05-2018T17:03:36,Bgrmystr2,maybe you saw the elusive one post out of 100 that wasn't three dots of nothing-to-say?

17-05-2018T20:28:50,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"you're not getting away that easily, lol"
17-05-2018T20:28:51,Bgrmystr2,HD speed possibly
17-05-2018T20:28:55,Keeeef,The laptop costs over one grand
17-05-2018T20:29:10,Bgrmystr2,it may be a 5200rpm hdd
17-05-2018T20:29:20,Bgrmystr2,and all it's money went into the CPU and GPU
17-05-2018T20:29:23,UnknownEnd,no longer exists!
17-05-2018T20:29:25,Keeeef,Although it could be the fact I installed it on a 64gb thumb drive

17-05-2018T20:29:32,ItsActuallyKopyKat,well
17-05-2018T20:29:33,Bgrmystr2,that's why
17-05-2018T20:29:38,ItsActuallyKopyKat,that would def explain it
17-05-2018T20:29:48,ItsActuallyKopyKat,it would've helped if you led with that lol
17-05-2018T20:29:48,Bgrmystr2,flash drives are slow as hell compared to HDs bro
17-05-2018T20:29:56,Bgrmystr2,yeah agree w/ Kopy XD
17-05-2018T20:30:00,Keeeef,I'm on a budget
17-05-2018T20:30:24,Bgrmystr2,that's.. not really a good choice even for a budget
17-05-2018T20:30:46,Keeeef,And my mom won't allow me to buy such a thing since we are setting an impossible goal to save up 2.5k to go to London in 3 years

17-05-2018T20:31:50,RH0DE,steam is complicated
17-05-2018T20:31:51,ItsActuallyKopyKat,because it's a realatively small client
17-05-2018T20:31:53,Keeeef,Same with crossout.
17-05-2018T20:31:58,ItsActuallyKopyKat,compared with steam
17-05-2018T20:32:47,Keeeef,realises how shite his life really is and joins UnknownEnd in the abyss of non existence.
17-05-2018T20:32:54,ItsActuallyKopyKat,aww

17-05-2018T20:34:07,Bgrmystr2,MC is actually fairly CPU and RAM intensive
17-05-2018T20:34:18,ItsActuallyKopyKat,esp with the chunk loading
17-05-2018T20:34:21,Bgrmystr2,"the bigger the world is, the more resources it takes to run"
17-05-2018T20:34:27,Keeeef,At least it can run Doom.
17-05-2018T20:34:29,Bgrmystr2,redstone makes it worse
17-05-2018T20:34:34,Bgrmystr2,yeah
17-05-2018T20:34:35,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Man, I haven't even looked at Minecraft in years"
17-05-2018T20:34:40,Bgrmystr2,you should try Optifine if you haven't already
17-05-2018T20:34:50,Keeeef,Bill Gates corrupted it.
17-05-2018T20:34:52,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"it's just sitting on my computer, collecting electro-dust"
17-05-2018T20:35:03,Bgrmystr2,it lets Minecraft render using multiple cores
17-05-2018T20:35:17,Bgrmystr2,along with a LOT of other improvements to the game to improve framerate
17-05-2018T20:35:21,UnknownEnd,Is now completely in the abyss
17-05-2018T20:35:21,Keeeef,Also you can't have forge and optifine in the same game.
17-05-2018T20:35:25,Combak,"Along with a few other im... Yeah, that."

17-05-2018T21:54:13,Mihari,Just cause it happens all the time every Friday doesn't make it any less.

17-05-2018T21:54:32,ItsActuallyKopyKat,lol
17-05-2018T21:54:32,SpazztasticKiwi,No Tom. Shame
17-05-2018T21:54:50,ZoieFalcona,"just some people after dealing with them, so feel like I gotta shower or I'll catch something"
17-05-2018T21:55:03,Mihari,"I just think if you turn off emotes, you shouldn't see all the spam words people do when they do them."
17-05-2018T21:55:15,Combak,Ha!
17-05-2018T21:55:24,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúDoes the catfish have fish in it?‚Äù

17-05-2018T21:55:31,Combak,"At that point, you might as well leave them on."
17-05-2018T21:55:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I was actually asked that
17-05-2018T21:55:32,Unenlagia,Somehow that's even worse
17-05-2018T21:55:42,ItsActuallyKopyKat,....kiwi

17-05-2018T21:55:54,ItsActuallyKopyKat,that's...that's...wow
17-05-2018T21:56:02,Mihari,I go to some streams when seeing the stupid animated ones are far worse than dealing Friday streams.
17-05-2018T21:56:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Took everything I me not to say ‚ÄúAre you shitting me?‚Äù
17-05-2018T21:56:08,Combak,Some people...

17-05-2018T21:56:40,Bespin,That is all
17-05-2018T21:56:41,Tharkis,is still insanely jealous of Mihari's animated avatar =(
17-05-2018T21:56:50,Tharkis,"my avatar wiggles her ears on most platforms, but not on picarto"
17-05-2018T21:56:56,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"everyone is, Tharkis"
17-05-2018T21:57:01,Nekonny,"Tom, I'm trying to recall if you ever take commissions during cons"
17-05-2018T21:57:12,Nekonny,Mihari still has an exclusive on that one
17-05-2018T21:57:20,Bgrmystr2,Kiwi.. does your catfish.. contain fish? :ptv-wondering: :V
17-05-2018T21:57:31,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs supposed to
17-05-2018T21:57:31,Mihari,"Yes, but it also means I can NEVER update my avatar."
17-05-2018T21:57:31,Twokinds,I do sketches at cons
17-05-2018T21:57:34,Tharkis,"yeah, waaayyy back in the dawn of picarto time they allowed you to upload gifs as avatar"
17-05-2018T21:57:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"no, no it does not, bgr"
17-05-2018T21:57:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Otherwise there‚Äôs gonna be problems
17-05-2018T21:57:53,Unenlagia,What is the percentage of fish in catfish?
17-05-2018T21:58:00,Tharkis,I totally would love to commision a con sketch if i can then.   Where / when do i get in line for that? =D
17-05-2018T21:58:04,Bgrmystr2,aw nooo Marv

17-05-2018T21:58:14,Bgrmystr2,xD ^
17-05-2018T21:58:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Expected percentage of fish in catfish is 100%
17-05-2018T21:58:22,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"the other half is cat, obviously"
17-05-2018T21:58:24,w0lfmare,"Yeah, that's how I got my Raine sketch"
17-05-2018T21:58:30,SpazztasticKiwi,But some places bread it to death

17-05-2018T21:58:49,ItsActuallyKopyKat,it's 50/50 cat/fish
17-05-2018T21:58:54,Nekonny,I have to ask you about hotels and such later
17-05-2018T21:58:55,Tharkis,my first Nekonny art was from kickstarter too !
17-05-2018T21:58:56,Mihari,If you grind your Tom rep you can get random loot.
17-05-2018T21:59:03,Mihari,Problem is finding the elusive quests to do so!

17-05-2018T22:11:25,Grip,Might be OBS issue.
17-05-2018T22:11:30,SageSaga,doubt it
17-05-2018T22:12:02,Bgrmystr2,"did you do a speed test, Sage"
17-05-2018T22:12:03,Nekonny,brb restroom

17-05-2018T22:12:22,SageSaga,ive done speed tests - OBS hasnt changed since last week
17-05-2018T22:12:43,Sliverwolf20,what about your firewall Sage?
17-05-2018T22:12:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Threatening me cause I call you less than nice isn‚Äôt nice so there
17-05-2018T22:12:58,Bgrmystr2,firewall likely won't change
17-05-2018T22:13:06,SpazztasticKiwi,:ptv-condescending: got ya
17-05-2018T22:13:07,SageSaga,my firewall hasnt changed either of course
17-05-2018T22:13:10,ItsActuallyKopyKat,I got my glasses today...it's nice being able to see detail at a distance again
17-05-2018T22:13:11,Bgrmystr2,and is unlikely to cause this anyway
17-05-2018T22:13:26,unsteddyphoenix,sight is pretty good I think
17-05-2018T22:13:27,Bgrmystr2,"yeh I know that feel, Kopy"
17-05-2018T22:13:27,Grip,Is your connection wired or wireless?
17-05-2018T22:13:36,SageSaga,wired of course
17-05-2018T22:13:59,Sliverwolf20,"I see, but I would run a quick scan just in case"
17-05-2018T22:14:03,unsteddyphoenix,Hardcore gaymers got no time for wifi
17-05-2018T22:14:11,Nekonny,reset router?
17-05-2018T22:14:19,Grip,Might be an issue at the ISP then. Or the cable could be going bad.
17-05-2018T22:14:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,hit me up with that dial up
17-05-2018T22:14:22,Bgrmystr2,"if your speed isn't lower than it should be even when your stream is running, honestly, I think it's probably just connectivity between you and picarto"
17-05-2018T22:14:31,SageSaga,=_=;
17-05-2018T22:14:35,Ordithus,I too am having PIcarto troubles...
17-05-2018T22:14:49,SageSaga,speed is fine for streaming what i am and download speed is fine too
17-05-2018T22:15:14,Grip,Then that narrows it down to Picarto related then
17-05-2018T22:15:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Picarto reminds me of a baby: always shitting itself

17-05-2018T22:54:41,Combak,"Yeah, they can subsidize the cost of the show with the product advertising."
17-05-2018T22:54:45,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs the problem. I know Danny Phantom was discontinued because of budget
17-05-2018T22:55:08,SpazztasticKiwi,They haven‚Äôt tried redoing it yet though

17-05-2018T22:59:59,SpazztasticKiwi,In the future
17-05-2018T23:00:05,unsteddyphoenix,sexcapades
17-05-2018T23:00:21,Bgrmystr2,aaaa
17-05-2018T23:00:25,Bgrmystr2,phoenix pls
17-05-2018T23:00:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Either that or Trace is setting up a pulley system to help Flora move around when she‚Äôs bigger
17-05-2018T23:00:42,ItsActuallyKopyKat,teddy yes!
17-05-2018T23:00:43,Bgrmystr2,"I think that was actually a show, phoenix"
17-05-2018T23:00:53,unsteddyphoenix,sounds great
17-05-2018T23:00:53,Bgrmystr2,named that.
17-05-2018T23:01:01,Bgrmystr2,"I never watched it, we didn't own the channel :v"
17-05-2018T23:01:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah 50 Shades of Grey unfortunately
17-05-2018T23:01:19,totallynotTrace,are we forgetting there is currently a wolf in Traces dungeon?
17-05-2018T23:01:20,Bgrmystr2,that's not the same name though kiwi
17-05-2018T23:01:25,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
17-05-2018T23:01:33,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"no, trace we are not"
17-05-2018T23:01:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Talking about the chain usage aspect
17-05-2018T23:01:43,Ordithus,Oh... I think they forgot there was a wolf in Trace's dungeon.
17-05-2018T23:01:48,Ordithus,He dead now...
17-05-2018T23:01:59,Bgrmystr2,I don't think the dungeon is the same as the 3rd floor
17-05-2018T23:02:06,Bgrmystr2,unless they are :ptv-shock:
17-05-2018T23:02:15,Ordithus,Dungeon with a view
17-05-2018T23:02:18,Bgrmystr2,Would trace do that..?
17-05-2018T23:02:27,Vatruvius,Hello! :ptv-greetings:
17-05-2018T23:02:33,Ordithus,Hi Vatru
17-05-2018T23:02:35,w0lfmare,Probably a chicken by now
17-05-2018T23:02:39,Bgrmystr2,hey Vatru
17-05-2018T23:02:45,Keeeef,I'm back
17-05-2018T23:02:50,Bgrmystr2,xD W0lf
17-05-2018T23:02:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"Vat, why are you late? :ctwokinds-FloDance:"
17-05-2018T23:03:02,Sammit,Hi Vatru
17-05-2018T23:03:06,Bgrmystr2,goddamnit that derp flora face got me again
17-05-2018T23:03:07,Vatruvius,lol...life happened Kiwi.
17-05-2018T23:03:10,Vatruvius,Been busy.
17-05-2018T23:03:15,ItsActuallyKopyKat,hi vatru!
17-05-2018T23:03:17,totallynotTrace,so third floor is the *kinky* dungeon and basement is just the dungeon?
17-05-2018T23:03:29,Bgrmystr2,or maybe the 3rd floor is.. both?
17-05-2018T23:03:30,Vatruvius,"Hey Kopy, Bgr, Ord, Kiwi, and everyone else!"
17-05-2018T23:03:31,ItsActuallyKopyKat,yep
17-05-2018T23:03:36,ItsActuallyKopyKat,@Trace
17-05-2018T23:03:50,MallardDuckAvia,Hey tom can you make a map of Trace's mansion sometime?
17-05-2018T23:04:03,Bgrmystr2,they can bend reality to make boobs go into a different dimension.. I think Trace could handle making the 3rd floor and the dungeon the same floor...
17-05-2018T23:04:04,Twokinds,lol nooooo
17-05-2018T23:04:06,ZRO4825,"Nah, third floor is the ""freedom torture"" dungeon. He gives'em a window to look at while they're chained and is like ""See that? That's the outside. You're never going out there again..."""
17-05-2018T23:04:07,Twokinds,It's too big
17-05-2018T23:04:13,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Oooh that's a long ass drawing
17-05-2018T23:04:13,Twokinds,Also it's like a TARDIS
17-05-2018T23:04:19,Justanotheruser7118,lol
17-05-2018T23:04:19,BadFoMo,@MallardDuckAvia I second that.
17-05-2018T23:04:24,Twokinds,It has whatever it needs to have
17-05-2018T23:04:28,BadFoMo,Aw...
17-05-2018T23:04:29,Keeeef,Filled with switches?
17-05-2018T23:04:37,Ordithus,The layout changes by the hour
17-05-2018T23:04:46,Vatruvius,"I was actually just checking in to see if we had a stream, I thought Tom was doing something this weekend or maybe Friday was fine? Anyway, now I know I missed a stream pretty much. I am actually going to sit down and eat with my family soon so..."
17-05-2018T23:04:47,Justanotheruser7118,"what, does it have its own star system inside it"
17-05-2018T23:04:52,MallardDuckAvia,Oh ok. I see.
17-05-2018T23:04:57,ZRO4825,It has Nora's heart.
17-05-2018T23:04:59,Keeeef,It changes when Trace loses his memory
17-05-2018T23:05:02,ZRO4825,Somewhere.
17-05-2018T23:05:04,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI need lingerie.‚Äù And it shows up in your exact size?
17-05-2018T23:05:12,Keeeef,Wuh
17-05-2018T23:05:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Too good to be true
17-05-2018T23:05:15,Ordithus,"Magic table, remember?"
17-05-2018T23:05:19,Bgrmystr2,Vatru that was the last weekend in the month
17-05-2018T23:05:24,Bgrmystr2,this is not the last weekend in the month
17-05-2018T23:05:27,Bgrmystr2,you accidentally.
17-05-2018T23:05:29,Bgrmystr2,somehow.
17-05-2018T23:05:37,MallardDuckAvia,Sometime later can we see some of Kat's past?
17-05-2018T23:05:43,Bgrmystr2,The no-stream is next week.
17-05-2018T23:05:46,Vatruvius,Okay.
17-05-2018T23:05:53,Vatruvius,Thanks for clearing that up for me Bgr.
17-05-2018T23:05:57,Keeeef,Wait there's no stream next week?
17-05-2018T23:06:05,Bgrmystr2,"Come back soon, and see the rest of the stream :thumbsup:"
17-05-2018T23:06:08,ZRO4825,What's there to see? o.O She was bred and raised by slavers and (iirc) ended up being given to Eric's family who has had her as a slave since.
17-05-2018T23:06:24,Vatruvius,"Alright, dinner is ready. Be back later, maybe. Bye guys!"
17-05-2018T23:06:29,unsteddyphoenix,It'd be less interesting and more...sad.
17-05-2018T23:06:30,ZRO4825,"Take care, Vatru '.'/"
17-05-2018T23:06:32,Justanotheruser7118,cya vat
17-05-2018T23:06:47,Keeeef,is slightly miffed
17-05-2018T23:06:49,BadFoMo,Is Nekonny's stream borked for anyone else?
17-05-2018T23:06:59,Ordithus,Yeah
17-05-2018T23:07:11,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
17-05-2018T23:07:16,w0lfmare,Nekonny is offline
17-05-2018T23:07:45,ItsActuallyKopyKat,because he got kicked
17-05-2018T23:07:48,ItsActuallyKopyKat,from streaming
17-05-2018T23:07:51,ItsActuallyKopyKat,I think
17-05-2018T23:07:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom will you be online at all next week, like just to peek at chat or whatever?"
17-05-2018T23:08:00,unsteddyphoenix,kicked into disconnect
17-05-2018T23:08:09,Bgrmystr2,he stopped streaming and went to sleep
17-05-2018T23:08:12,Bgrmystr2,just checked his page
17-05-2018T23:08:23,Ordithus,"Huh, damn, missed him going"
17-05-2018T23:08:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Neo go sleep-o
17-05-2018T23:08:46,Bgrmystr2,cuz it didn't happen here Ord
17-05-2018T23:08:49,Bgrmystr2,it happened on his stream page
17-05-2018T23:08:54,Bgrmystr2,cuz sage removed him from the multi
17-05-2018T23:09:10,Justanotheruser7118,wait why
17-05-2018T23:09:12,MallardDuckAvia,Some kid hijacked a golf cart at my school and drove it off the second story balcony and it crashed
17-05-2018T23:09:18,Ordithus,"I could still see his stream here, so I was a bit confused"
17-05-2018T23:09:26,Ordithus,I understand now
17-05-2018T23:09:27,Bgrmystr2,cuz you didn't update the page lol
17-05-2018T23:09:42,BadFoMo,@MallardDuckAvia Are they ok?
17-05-2018T23:09:43,Ordithus,cuz I'm a rebel :ptv-dealwithit:
17-05-2018T23:09:45,Bgrmystr2,yeh picarto doesn't auto-update when someone leaves
17-05-2018T23:09:49,Twokinds,Maybe
17-05-2018T23:09:53,Bgrmystr2,"I didn't update it either, I left it playing :v"
17-05-2018T23:09:54,totallynotTrace,wow it crashed? few. I thought it didnt and flew away
17-05-2018T23:09:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Cool
17-05-2018T23:10:08,Keeeef,Flying Golf Cart
17-05-2018T23:10:30,Bgrmystr2,best golf cart
17-05-2018T23:10:57,ZRO4825,Hell no that ain't best golf cart. Pigeons leave a big enough mess. Can you imagine the mess a golf cart would leave?
17-05-2018T23:10:59,MallardDuckAvia,IDK. My school is weird. 80% of people show up to school high and somebody taught my teacher to vape in class
17-05-2018T23:11:16,Keeeef,An Oil Spill?
17-05-2018T23:11:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"Have a nice flight then. Try not to think about the fact that you‚Äôre in a giant metal tube hurtling through the air at a few thousand miles an hour about 10,000 feet in the air"
17-05-2018T23:11:28,Bgrmystr2,"if your golf cart makes a mess, you got the wrong cart, zro"
17-05-2018T23:11:48,ZRO4825,"Hey, man, if it flies, I'm watching out for falling particles of stuff no one wants to get hit with, just sayin :V"
17-05-2018T23:11:54,unsteddyphoenix,"As long as you believe planes make sense, they work"
17-05-2018T23:11:58,Keeeef,Get one that had it's oil recently changed.
17-05-2018T23:12:09,Bgrmystr2,I don't remember planes doing that kinda thing while they fly around so
17-05-2018T23:12:12,Bgrmystr2,:u
17-05-2018T23:12:18,Bgrmystr2,"if a golf cart does, somethin's wrong"
17-05-2018T23:12:21,Keeeef,The lavatory might
17-05-2018T23:12:23,MallardDuckAvia,"Flying is awesome. I'm working on my pilots license right now. Also, Airliners fly at 30,000 feet to 40,000 feet. Not 10,000 feet"
17-05-2018T23:12:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Even better
17-05-2018T23:12:43,Ordithus,"Cool, Mallard!"
17-05-2018T23:12:52,Justanotheruser7118,Just think of the people who went to space tho
17-05-2018T23:13:02,Justanotheruser7118,Imagine what they thought
17-05-2018T23:13:20,MallardDuckAvia,My flight instructor is a bad ass. She's a hot blonde in her 20s who rides a motorcycle to the airport
17-05-2018T23:13:22,Bgrmystr2,"""Huh, I'm floating.... cool"""
17-05-2018T23:13:24,Bgrmystr2,probably.
17-05-2018T23:13:29,Justanotheruser7118,In a tin can
17-05-2018T23:13:30,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI think I left the water running ‚Äú
17-05-2018T23:13:32,ItsActuallyKopyKat,neat
17-05-2018T23:13:34,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah probably ""hey this is kinda neat"
17-05-2018T23:13:39,unsteddyphoenix,Thats what id think
17-05-2018T23:13:48,Justanotheruser7118,and if it explodes....
17-05-2018T23:14:06,unsteddyphoenix,Holy shit Maddie is cute dude.
17-05-2018T23:14:06,Bgrmystr2,"if the tin can explodes, everyone crys :C"
17-05-2018T23:14:18,ItsActuallyKopyKat,uh yeah teddy
17-05-2018T23:14:19,ItsActuallyKopyKat,der
17-05-2018T23:14:34,unsteddyphoenix,But like. I reckon shes even cuter than Maeve
17-05-2018T23:14:40,MallardDuckAvia,Planes are very safe except in North Korea and Cuba. Your more likely going to die in a car crash on the way to the airport then in a plane crash
17-05-2018T23:14:41,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Hmmm
17-05-2018T23:14:44,ItsActuallyKopyKat,maybe
17-05-2018T23:14:54,ZRO4825,"Them's fightin words, Unsteddy"
17-05-2018T23:15:00,unsteddyphoenix,CONTRIVERSIAL
17-05-2018T23:15:14,Bgrmystr2,"yeh mallard, but when a plane crashes, it takes several hundred people with it"
17-05-2018T23:15:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Unsteddy you take that back
17-05-2018T23:15:21,Bgrmystr2,car accident.. not so much
17-05-2018T23:15:41,unsteddyphoenix,:ptv-sneakysmirk:
17-05-2018T23:15:42,totallynotTrace,"wait. So yull die in a car crash, THEN die again in a plane crash?"
17-05-2018T23:15:44,Combak,And yet you are still statically more likely to die in a car accident.
17-05-2018T23:15:54,Bgrmystr2,yes nottrace. You die twice.
17-05-2018T23:15:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Maeve has the plush tail
17-05-2018T23:15:57,Bgrmystr2,Then lose all your souls
17-05-2018T23:15:58,MallardDuckAvia,Except not all plane crashes kill lots of people. A 737 crashed in Cuba and only one person died today
17-05-2018T23:15:59,ZRO4825,There are explosions every time I get in my car and go somewhere. o.o;
17-05-2018T23:16:11,Keeeef,Lol
17-05-2018T23:16:13,unsteddyphoenix,She does have the floof factor
17-05-2018T23:16:14,Twokinds,Not me
17-05-2018T23:16:16,Combak,"Very small, controlled explosions."
17-05-2018T23:16:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Not you what - there‚Äôs multiple conversations going on
17-05-2018T23:16:32,Combak,... Unless your car is electric. I think.
17-05-2018T23:16:36,MallardDuckAvia,Most planes crash on landing when they are slow and at an airport where there is lots of safety eqy
17-05-2018T23:16:40,ZRO4825,"Quit givin away my secrets, Combak! D:"
17-05-2018T23:16:44,SageSaga,Tom and I both are getting on planes next week so thanks a lot guys
17-05-2018T23:16:45,MallardDuckAvia,*equipment
17-05-2018T23:16:50,Justanotheruser7118,XD
17-05-2018T23:16:53,totallynotTrace,actually more than 100 died in the cuban 737 crash today
17-05-2018T23:16:56,SpazztasticKiwi,you‚Äôre very welcome
17-05-2018T23:16:57,Ordithus,You'll be fine
17-05-2018T23:16:58,Combak,You're welcome! Now you know how safe you are!
17-05-2018T23:16:58,Keeeef,Oh no
17-05-2018T23:17:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Happy to help
17-05-2018T23:17:01,Bgrmystr2,hahaha np sage
17-05-2018T23:17:10,MallardDuckAvia,It said only one in the article I read
17-05-2018T23:17:31,unsteddyphoenix,Stay calm and think about the complimentary peanuts
17-05-2018T23:17:38,ZRO4825,"I mean, look at it this way, Sage. According to this conversation, you've got FAR more to worry about on the car ride to the airport than on the plane. :P"
17-05-2018T23:17:42,Bgrmystr2,"srsly though planes are still very safe, moreso than cars"
17-05-2018T23:17:43,MallardDuckAvia,That was in Cuba on an old plane though so nothing to worry about
17-05-2018T23:17:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also Zro, if that‚Äôs the case with your car, it sounds like a problem"
17-05-2018T23:17:47,totallynotTrace,cnn and new york times both sayin &gt;100
17-05-2018T23:17:55,MallardDuckAvia,Ok
17-05-2018T23:18:04,ZRO4825,"No, Kiwi, that's a combustion engine working as is intended. :P"
17-05-2018T23:18:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah. Be paranoid about who‚Äôs driving you to the ‚Äòport
17-05-2018T23:18:13,MallardDuckAvia,Btw do you prefer the a320 or 737?
17-05-2018T23:18:16,totallynotTrace,although i wish it was only 1
17-05-2018T23:18:16,Bgrmystr2,"well Kiwi, in a car you gotta worry about OTHER cars"
17-05-2018T23:18:19,Bgrmystr2,Planes.. not so much
17-05-2018T23:18:28,Combak,That's what you think!
17-05-2018T23:18:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Other stupid people
17-05-2018T23:18:30,Zakuru,ya gotta worry about birds
17-05-2018T23:18:36,Zakuru,and crying children
17-05-2018T23:18:37,SpazztasticKiwi,And storms
17-05-2018T23:18:40,Combak,They have air traffic controllers for a reason.
17-05-2018T23:18:42,Justanotheruser7118,unless you're in an acrobatic squad
17-05-2018T23:18:47,Justanotheruser7118,of planes
17-05-2018T23:18:48,MallardDuckAvia,Planes collide in mid air. It just radar helps
17-05-2018T23:18:50,SpazztasticKiwi,And people who want to use you as a pillow
17-05-2018T23:18:56,Bgrmystr2,don't worry about birds. You'll just land in the hudson and be fine :v
17-05-2018T23:19:05,ZRO4825,No need to worry about birds! They just get sucked in the engine and come out the backside of the turbine as a pile of feathers.
17-05-2018T23:19:09,MallardDuckAvia,Two JAL planes got within feet of each other once
17-05-2018T23:19:20,Bgrmystr2,"yeah one or two, zro"
17-05-2018T23:19:28,Bgrmystr2,but a whole pack tends to be more of a problem
17-05-2018T23:19:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"In go bird, out go tenderized meat ready to cook"
17-05-2018T23:19:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Kinda
17-05-2018T23:19:38,Ordithus,Two planes crashed midair in the next town from me a few years back.  No deaths.
17-05-2018T23:19:42,totallynotTrace,actually bgr planes tend to crash at airports. ok its not common but thats the most likely place
17-05-2018T23:19:47,ZRO4825,That's why  you don't try to fly through the whole freakin flock. :V
17-05-2018T23:19:51,MallardDuckAvia,Birds do take down planes. Hear about Sully? The Jet Blue?
17-05-2018T23:20:03,Bgrmystr2,"into each other, nottrace? as much as cars? :P"
17-05-2018T23:20:13,Bgrmystr2,I literally just referenced that Mallard lol

17-05-2018T23:20:58,Bgrmystr2,xD Kiwi
17-05-2018T23:21:07,MallardDuckAvia,It's just not very likely in modern times
17-05-2018T23:21:24,Combak,"Wow, they're like star crossed lovers! Let those two planes be together people!"
17-05-2018T23:21:24,Bgrmystr2,thankfully we're not in the 1800s when planes didn't have all that guidance chip stuff :vvv
17-05-2018T23:21:34,Ordithus,"What is unusual is when everyone makes it out alive, unscathed even!"
17-05-2018T23:21:40,MallardDuckAvia,Planes didn't exist in the 1800s
17-05-2018T23:21:44,Ordithus,1800s bgr...
17-05-2018T23:21:53,MallardDuckAvia,They were invented in 1903
17-05-2018T23:21:56,Bgrmystr2,thanks for explaining the JOKE mallard :ptv-pouty:
17-05-2018T23:22:06,totallynotTrace,earlier this week a airliners wing clipped the tail of another while taxiing at an airport somewhere in the us. I forget the details. it grounded both planes
17-05-2018T23:22:23,Ordithus,There were baloons and I think gliders already
17-05-2018T23:22:24,Justanotheruser7118,well people tried to make planes with steam engines lol
17-05-2018T23:22:33,MallardDuckAvia,It was Turkish Airlines and an Asiana a330
17-05-2018T23:22:46,Justanotheruser7118,"'well just photoshop a sky in, no big deal"""

17-05-2018T23:23:05,Bgrmystr2,"if it involves driving, Kiwi, you're in even MORE danger"
17-05-2018T23:23:11,Ordithus,Flying is fun :)
17-05-2018T23:23:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Not a lot. It‚Äôs right in town
17-05-2018T23:23:28,MallardDuckAvia,Speaking of helicopters I flew a US Army black hawk simulator a few months ago
17-05-2018T23:23:54,MallardDuckAvia,I've also flown a Cessna and a 1968 Piper Cherokee
17-05-2018T23:23:55,Justanotheruser7118,A flying simulator....

17-05-2018T23:24:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Well the guns are stun guns. Actual guns are at the pawn shops
17-05-2018T23:24:45,Bgrmystr2,hard to wrap my head around it
17-05-2018T23:24:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Can‚Äôt have em out in the open
17-05-2018T23:24:55,MallardDuckAvia,Yep. I also have a simulator at my house
17-05-2018T23:25:21,MallardDuckAvia,I can land an a380 if I needed to.
17-05-2018T23:25:27,Justanotheruser7118,so you can buzz that control tower anytime
17-05-2018T23:25:28,Bgrmystr2,"is it one of those bigass 3d ones that move and tilt and stuff, Mallard?"
17-05-2018T23:25:48,Ordithus,Anyone can land an A380.  It's doing it with survivors that's the hard part :ptv-snicker:
17-05-2018T23:25:51,MallardDuckAvia,No. It can be plugged into one though
17-05-2018T23:25:59,Bgrmystr2,Not good enough &gt;:T Gotta own one yourself
17-05-2018T23:25:59,MallardDuckAvia,I just don't have that money
17-05-2018T23:26:10,Bgrmystr2,yeah I expect them to be kinda $$$
17-05-2018T23:26:23,Ordithus,Karen why so serious
17-05-2018T23:26:29,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"anyone can land anything, once"
17-05-2018T23:26:38,ItsActuallyKopyKat,just like drinking lava
17-05-2018T23:26:40,MallardDuckAvia,I'm going to Wisconsin this summer for the Oshkosh air show and that's all the money I have
17-05-2018T23:26:45,Bgrmystr2,well.. you can ground something quite easily
17-05-2018T23:26:47,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"you can do it, but only once"
17-05-2018T23:26:50,Ordithus,"Cool, I'll be there too"
17-05-2018T23:27:07,Bgrmystr2,landing kinda implies something didn't go wrong
17-05-2018T23:27:13,MallardDuckAvia,I can land an a380 safely and live to tell about it
17-05-2018T23:27:34,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"you're ahead of the pack then, mallard"
17-05-2018T23:27:54,MallardDuckAvia,I've done it in my sim which can be used in full motion to train pilots so it's pretty accurate
17-05-2018T23:28:04,Twokinds,Don't you mean ahead of the quack

17-05-2018T23:30:44,MallardDuckAvia,I flew Mach 7 in a SR71 10 fee to above the suburbs of LA then did flips until I pulled to many Gs and crashed
17-05-2018T23:30:59,Ordithus,Mach 7?!
17-05-2018T23:31:00,Bgrmystr2,hahaha that sounds brilliant
17-05-2018T23:31:09,SpazztasticKiwi,If you‚Äôre referencing what I think you are about ducks yeah it‚Äôs disturbing
17-05-2018T23:31:11,MallardDuckAvia,Ducks are cute until the fly in walks and break their necks

17-05-2018T23:33:46,unsteddyphoenix,I see no PROOF of this
17-05-2018T23:33:54,MallardDuckAvia,Hoomans can also be smart and change the environment to favor them
