07-02-2018T00:06:31,CrypticCobra,"to her drawing, its basically the dragon heiarchy"

07-02-2018T05:29:57,iliar,"5 am? Tom, have you not slept all night?"
07-02-2018T05:30:18,Twokinds,Nope I am very tired
07-02-2018T05:30:21,Twokinds,Page finally up
07-02-2018T05:30:25,Twokinds,Transcript not done but too tired
07-02-2018T05:30:47,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-excited:
07-02-2018T05:31:24,iliar,I already saw. I have notifications when you add a page. I will now make a transcript.
07-02-2018T05:32:15,Bgrmystr2,DIS DRAGON LORE
07-02-2018T05:32:45,Bgrmystr2,Iliar's on it. Good work. :thumbsup:
07-02-2018T05:34:11,Bgrmystr2,"But this page clearly indicates that if Nora acts casually around Trace, she sees him as someone powerful enough worthy of her respect."
07-02-2018T05:34:34,Bgrmystr2,"and being Nora, that proves just how scary powerful trace was :u"
07-02-2018T05:34:44,iliar,Nora is amazing! I want wallpaper with Nora like this!
07-02-2018T05:34:47,Bgrmystr2,IKR
07-02-2018T05:35:40,Bgrmystr2,"Also, I enjoy that TFS reference, Tom"
07-02-2018T05:35:48,Bgrmystr2,Appreciate that. xD
07-02-2018T05:37:24,unsteddyphoenix,Did Reni just swear BY Nora? That's some reverance damn
07-02-2018T05:38:22,iliar,@Bgrmystr2 I know about preview
07-02-2018T05:38:42,Bgrmystr2,kay
07-02-2018T05:39:03,Bgrmystr2,well getouttahere then with your wallpaper request.
07-02-2018T05:39:09,Bgrmystr2,cuz it's useless now :V
07-02-2018T05:39:23,Bgrmystr2,or fulfilled.
07-02-2018T05:39:30,iliar,But the preview does not have a convenient aspect ratio.
07-02-2018T05:40:12,Bgrmystr2,"perhaps not, but that's never stopped me from putting wallpapers like that on 16:9 ratio displays"
07-02-2018T05:40:42,Bgrmystr2,"though I guess when I'm running a 27"" and 32"", the size kind of negates the negatives."
07-02-2018T05:48:54,iliar,"When you have big 4k monitor, normal FullHD Wallpapers don't fit anymore. I will be needed to found a good sketch with Nora and use Nora Card on it."
07-02-2018T05:51:41,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-wondering: I don't use 4k, I've got three 1080p displays on a gtx 760. Quartercircle setup, obviously as that's the most ideal."
07-02-2018T05:51:59,Bgrmystr2,so I wouldn't lose much detail on that piece
07-02-2018T05:52:12,Bgrmystr2,"but even if I was using 4k, I'd just upscale it using a vector program or something"
07-02-2018T05:52:22,Bgrmystr2,"cuz at that point, I'd have hardware capable of doing so"
07-02-2018T09:31:16,TheBeckoner,I like the New comic page Tom. Good stuffs.

07-02-2018T17:12:46,Bgrmystr2,That very thing.
07-02-2018T17:12:51,Bgrmystr2,"Also, cuz of my age, but"

07-02-2018T17:13:49,Bgrmystr2,"it won't teach me anything I don't already know, and I can say that with confidence because I know several people who TOOK the classes I would have taken"
07-02-2018T17:13:55,Bgrmystr2,and they didn't learn shit
07-02-2018T17:14:16,wolfspartan1,school in the usa is trash

07-02-2018T18:02:25,TheBeckoner,"Im still pretty normal without my glasses, for now."
07-02-2018T18:06:30,RedDeath2018,My glasses are very important
07-02-2018T18:06:57,RedDeath2018,If I don’t wear them everything is blurry if it is 1 foot or more away from me
07-02-2018T18:07:01,TheBeckoner,My mother is legally blind though. That sorta tells me what I'll degenerate into.
07-02-2018T18:07:29,TheBeckoner,"Dang, what do y'all do on days without them?"
07-02-2018T18:08:14,RedDeath2018,Well I wear them every day but when I don’t wear them I bassically squint the entire time
07-02-2018T18:08:47,TheBeckoner,"I can make out detail on a person to about 25 feet, and I can make out signs pretty far out."
07-02-2018T18:09:01,RedDeath2018,Not me
07-02-2018T18:09:08,TheBeckoner,"I heard squinting isnt very good, I wonder if thats true..."
07-02-2018T18:09:35,RedDeath2018,It hasn’t affected me the past years that I’ve been doing it
07-02-2018T18:10:39,RedDeath2018,Wearing glasses is a normal thing now
07-02-2018T18:10:46,RedDeath2018,For me
07-02-2018T18:11:17,TheBeckoner,I elect not to wear mine because I can.
07-02-2018T18:11:47,RedDeath2018,Well that is your choice
07-02-2018T18:12:57,RedDeath2018,Wearing glasses everyday has totally changed my eyesight. I used to never wear my glasses and when I did it was for short periods of time
07-02-2018T18:13:27,RedDeath2018,Anyway I got to go. Gotta play football with my brothers

07-02-2018T18:14:35,Bgrmystr2,the only people who actually don't wear them all the time is just those who need them to read and whatnot
07-02-2018T18:14:47,TheBeckoner,I'm sure. My eyesight just ins super bad.
07-02-2018T18:15:06,TheBeckoner,isnt*
07-02-2018T18:15:57,TheBeckoner,I also dont wear them because I spend alot of time on my computer and they make lines appear across my monitor. That and they make it hard to focus.
07-02-2018T18:17:11,Bgrmystr2,they're probably for focusing far away
07-02-2018T18:17:14,Bgrmystr2,rather than close up
07-02-2018T18:17:22,Bgrmystr2,also common

07-02-2018T19:09:33,wolfspartan1,yes

07-02-2018T19:10:34,wolfspartan1,ok
07-02-2018T19:17:19,JaydenMozingo,Does anybody else here have braces?

07-02-2018T19:21:56,MidnightBlue78,"I had braces a really long time ago, so not sure if i would be of much help"
07-02-2018T19:26:52,JaydenMozingo,"when you had them, How white did your teeth stay nomatter how much or how hard you brushed?"
07-02-2018T19:29:15,MidnightBlue78,Mine didnt change
07-02-2018T19:30:24,JaydenMozingo,hmm
07-02-2018T19:30:58,MidnightBlue78,"at least, that I can recall"
07-02-2018T19:34:54,MidnightBlue78,"my teeth have never been very white, but they didnt get more discolored"
07-02-2018T19:38:21,JaydenMozingo,"Ok good, because the glue that holds the brackets on kind of prevents me from brushing that part of my tooth"
07-02-2018T19:44:05,JaydenMozingo,Thank you
07-02-2018T19:44:41,JaydenMozingo,"Well, I guess when life gives you lemons..."
07-02-2018T19:44:45,JaydenMozingo,has died
07-02-2018T20:11:11,TheBeckoner,I believe the natural color of teeth is slightly yellow iirc
07-02-2018T20:14:00,JaydenMozingo,Probably. People probably only get them pure white because they use bleaching chemicals in toothpaste to whiten them
07-02-2018T20:26:17,Twokinds,MY SHINY TEETH THAT TWINKLE JUST LIKE THE STARS IN SPAAAACE

07-02-2018T20:33:54,JaydenMozingo,Maddie's eyes are so pretty
07-02-2018T20:34:09,JaydenMozingo,Tom XD

07-02-2018T20:35:16,unsteddyphoenix,Never knew it was so iconic
07-02-2018T20:36:13,Dadrobit,iT'S ALSO THE SAME TUNE AS THE abc'S SONG

07-02-2018T20:44:54,JaydenMozingo,I just wish I could draw and play violin but I can only learn one at a time:crying_cat_face:
07-02-2018T20:46:11,unsteddyphoenix,Draw a violin then play it
07-02-2018T20:47:12,JaydenMozingo,XD I'll try that
07-02-2018T20:47:51,Twokinds,"Oh, I am quite familiar with Time"
07-02-2018T20:47:57,JaydenMozingo,drew a violin and attempted to play it but got a paper cut and bled to death
07-02-2018T20:48:16,wolfspartan1,rip jay
07-02-2018T20:48:33,JaydenMozingo,You listen to Hans Zimmer as well?
07-02-2018T20:48:59,Twokinds,Yeah it's good stuff
07-02-2018T20:49:11,Twokinds,Inception had a great soundtrack
07-02-2018T20:49:19,JaydenMozingo,I always ask people if they have heard Hans Zimmer and they always said no
07-02-2018T20:49:27,JaydenMozingo,And Interstellar
07-02-2018T20:50:03,Dadrobit,"Everyone has, they just don't know it lol"
07-02-2018T20:50:46,JaydenMozingo,Have you seen interstellar? It has that 'movie logic' in it but it's a great movie otherwise
07-02-2018T20:54:17,Dadrobit,"Batman, Pirates of the Caribbean, Divergent, Transformers, Iron Man, The Prestige, dude's been around."
07-02-2018T20:54:50,TheBeckoner,speaking of time...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XcKBmdfpWs

07-02-2018T20:55:53,JaydenMozingo,Too much time on my hands my dude
07-02-2018T20:57:31,JaydenMozingo,The facial expressions he makes throughout the recording are amazing. lol. Good song though
07-02-2018T21:01:14,TheBeckoner,One of my favorites

07-02-2018T21:15:52,wolfspartan1,lol
07-02-2018T21:26:36,JaydenMozingo,"Hey Tom, approximately how many layers do you think you used on the 'Carver teleportation bath time' coloured picture?"
07-02-2018T21:27:36,Twokinds,Approximately exactly 24 layers
07-02-2018T21:30:00,JaydenMozingo,"Wow. So with that being said, it explains why when I attempted to draw Natani it (for the most part) failed because I only used 3 layers."
07-02-2018T21:30:24,JaydenMozingo,XD
07-02-2018T21:31:59,JaydenMozingo,"So I noted that for next time. A single character can be a crap ton of layers. Now I see why. Shading, background, eyes, colour itself, outline, etc"
07-02-2018T21:32:41,JaydenMozingo,Thanks!
07-02-2018T21:32:43,Ordithus,"Onions have layers, drawings have layers."

07-02-2018T22:24:47,JaydenMozingo,Yes

07-02-2018T22:27:24,JaydenMozingo,Yeah! lol
07-02-2018T22:27:35,NightMeaty22,🔜
07-02-2018T22:28:39,JaydenMozingo,I feel like if there were one it would be him with his blind eye glinting and raising his eyebrow  at the user
07-02-2018T22:28:59,JaydenMozingo,Much like the pervy Nora emote
07-02-2018T22:29:34,JaydenMozingo,Nora... 2000 years old and Reni has a point. She doesn't exactly 'act' her age
07-02-2018T22:29:42,NightMeaty22,There should be a flora emote where she is in the box
07-02-2018T22:30:25,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, I think Nora acts exactly as someone would after living for 2000 years and becoming one of the most powerful beings"
07-02-2018T22:30:27,JaydenMozingo,Ye. Box Tiger Kitty
07-02-2018T22:30:56,JaydenMozingo,Well you do see George Bush Jr
07-02-2018T22:31:09,Bgrmystr2,"After that long, the morals and other such things you held previously would slip away. There would be more greys and less black and white"
07-02-2018T22:31:12,NightMeaty22,I need a profile pic what should i do
07-02-2018T22:31:21,JaydenMozingo,"Becomes President, acts like a 10 year old all over again"
07-02-2018T22:31:24,Bgrmystr2,"pick something that you like, Night"
07-02-2018T22:31:37,NightMeaty22,Ok
07-02-2018T22:31:54,Bgrmystr2,no human has ever lived long enough to actually reach the point where Nora is
07-02-2018T22:31:58,Bgrmystr2,so there is no comparison
07-02-2018T22:33:50,Bgrmystr2,older people get more widom and have less pity for those who hurt themselves. There's a lot of acceptance yet a lack of emotional connection. You connect to less things as well as value less and less.
07-02-2018T22:33:54,Bgrmystr2,Your standards get higher
07-02-2018T22:35:10,Bgrmystr2,"and it's easily suggested that Nora's choices may look childish, it's really not."
07-02-2018T22:35:14,JaydenMozingo,You should give speeches man. You too beck. I honestly couldn't have said it better
07-02-2018T22:35:53,Bgrmystr2,Nora is petty and punishes people in unorthadox ways. Shows them what it's like to be in the other pair of shoes.
07-02-2018T22:36:03,Bgrmystr2,It's something that needs to happen.
07-02-2018T22:36:09,Bgrmystr2,but very rarely does.

07-02-2018T22:41:32,JaydenMozingo,(close out picarto and signback in. that might help)
07-02-2018T22:41:53,NightMeaty22,Just did
07-02-2018T22:42:21,Bgrmystr2,"that alone doesn't do anything to the cache, jay"

07-02-2018T22:43:23,JaydenMozingo,"Oh. Well it worked for me when I uploaded a picture. Wouldn't show. reloaded the page. didn't show. closed the page and started it up again, showed right away"
07-02-2018T22:43:44,Bgrmystr2,"Probably because your browser is not set to save the cache when it closes the page, jay"
07-02-2018T22:43:54,JaydenMozingo,Oof
07-02-2018T22:44:19,Bgrmystr2,"mine is, so I just use ctrl+F5 and clear the cache"

07-02-2018T22:44:32,Bgrmystr2,so that way any new icons will show up
07-02-2018T22:44:58,Bgrmystr2,chrome is probably shift+F5 though

07-02-2018T22:45:20,JaydenMozingo,What exactly is the cache?

07-02-2018T22:46:03,JaydenMozingo,Lol
07-02-2018T22:46:19,Bgrmystr2,"Alt+F5 does nothing in Firefox, so I dunno."
07-02-2018T22:46:21,NightMeaty22,Lol
07-02-2018T22:47:12,JaydenMozingo,Nice pic though man. I like that one. Father son bonding!!
07-02-2018T22:47:21,Bgrmystr2,a cache is a local storage. Your browser will use it so that way it can pull up the images off the device you're using instead of having to download the image every single time it wants to show it on your display.
07-02-2018T22:47:26,NightMeaty22,drown in bacement do to water heater explosion
07-02-2018T22:47:46,JaydenMozingo,"Anyway, back to being dead.I'll be back in a few"
07-02-2018T22:47:52,JaydenMozingo,Rip Night
07-02-2018T22:47:58,Bgrmystr2,"Lots of things have caches. motherboards, hard drives, desktops, phones, etc etc"

07-02-2018T22:49:06,Bgrmystr2,seeya later
07-02-2018T22:49:40,TheBeckoner,Humans have a cache.
07-02-2018T22:49:46,TheBeckoner,See yah night
07-02-2018T22:53:01,Bgrmystr2,"lol yeah, your memories is technically a cache"
07-02-2018T22:53:33,Bgrmystr2,"everything you do during the day, then when you sleep, your brain processes everything that happened it stores it"
07-02-2018T22:54:41,Bgrmystr2,tis why some ppl can't remember the what they did the same day vs other ppl not remembering what they did the previous day
07-02-2018T22:54:49,Bgrmystr2,long term vs short term memory
07-02-2018T22:55:11,TheBeckoner,yup. It usually does any sort of memory deleting right there on the spot. Certain thing throughout the day though give a signal to be stored though.
07-02-2018T22:55:15,Bgrmystr2,"and how their body handles the information, sleeping habits, etc"
07-02-2018T22:55:21,TheBeckoner,Yeah.
07-02-2018T22:55:34,TheBeckoner,My short term memory is pretty shit.
07-02-2018T22:55:43,TheBeckoner,Decent long term I suppose
07-02-2018T22:56:36,Bgrmystr2,"I have a more photographic long-term memory. Can't remember people's names for a while, and GL to me remembering what anyone looks like"
07-02-2018T22:56:48,Bgrmystr2,but images and stuff I can recall pretty easily
07-02-2018T22:57:35,Bgrmystr2,"colors, shapes, some details, it's not exceptional, but definitely photographic. I can still see images in my head that I haven't seen in years"
07-02-2018T22:57:36,TheBeckoner,Same here. Although I would go quite as far to say my long term is photographic.
07-02-2018T22:58:17,Bgrmystr2,"When I was little, I saw my father playing some game on his pc, flying a helicopter through a base, attacking stuff, etc"
07-02-2018T22:58:19,TheBeckoner,I guess vertain things are very clear.
07-02-2018T22:58:28,Bgrmystr2,it was the only time I ever saw it
07-02-2018T22:59:02,Bgrmystr2,"and 6 months later, I had made some bigass paper thing and nearly replicated what I saw point for point"
07-02-2018T22:59:25,TheBeckoner,"I told myself to remember a spot in mexico on the ground, and I still remember it like it was  only a few hours ago. that was probably 10 years ago."
07-02-2018T22:59:56,TheBeckoner,That's pretty neat though.
07-02-2018T23:00:11,Bgrmystr2,"roads, buildings, cliffs, oil tanks, basically everything there was that I saw him come up to, I remembered"
07-02-2018T23:00:39,Bgrmystr2,I think I watched him play for maybe.. 5 mins? And 6 months later I was able to recall it entirely
07-02-2018T23:01:09,Bgrmystr2,I was so young at the time.. 5.. 6 maybe?
07-02-2018T23:01:30,TheBeckoner,I recall losing a game of pacman tetris in my dads office when I was about 7
07-02-2018T23:01:39,Bgrmystr2,aw :o
07-02-2018T23:02:07,TheBeckoner,I remember very clearly because thats when I figured out losing wasnt the same as winning lol
07-02-2018T23:02:26,TheBeckoner,I honestly thought I won every single game up to that point lol
07-02-2018T23:02:36,TheBeckoner,Turns out I lost every single game...
07-02-2018T23:09:04,Bgrmystr2,"oh, I thought you meant you lost the game entirely and couldn't find it"
07-02-2018T23:09:56,NightMeaty22,I'm back

07-02-2018T23:19:04,Bgrmystr2,I don't eat anything spicy either
07-02-2018T23:19:18,Bgrmystr2,"if I wanted to burn my tounge, I'd lick fire. :ptv-unimpressed:"
07-02-2018T23:19:30,Bgrmystr2,"But since I'm not stupid, I don't."
07-02-2018T23:19:39,Bgrmystr2,and ignore spicy foods and carbonated drinks.
07-02-2018T23:20:09,NightMeaty22,I eat dry ice it is better than soda
07-02-2018T23:20:41,Bgrmystr2,I just drink Tea and Milk. Sometimes make some root beer

07-02-2018T23:45:00,Dadrobit,"Goddamn, this lady is literally the worst plagiarist I have ever seen. Her entire discussion response that should be about our preferred source for music is just a copy-pasted blog post from some dude talking about the differences between terrestrial and"
07-02-2018T23:45:13,Dadrobit,internet radio. She didn't even change the formatting
07-02-2018T23:47:03,Dadrobit,"And you can tell that she just threw on two sentences at the end because is goes from fairly eloquent vocab to talking about ""Pandoras freemiumium opton"""

07-02-2018T23:52:19,TheBeckoner,Better right?
07-02-2018T23:52:31,JaydenMozingo,I'd agree
07-02-2018T23:53:45,Dadrobit,"I mean, considering a goodly portion of this class is learning about copyright laws, I'd say blatant plagiarism goes beyond ironic."
07-02-2018T23:54:10,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe it's modern art
07-02-2018T23:54:41,Dadrobit,"Then again, she's an aspiring rapper with a stutter, so maybe irony is just her thing?"
