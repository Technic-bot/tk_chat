03-11-2018T00:08:08,Ordithus,Was that the kid that kept getting banned but would come back with a new name?
03-11-2018T00:08:11,Mippy,"Oh, that kid. Seen him under different monikers many times"

03-11-2018T00:10:28,GhostPack24,I am the only one
03-11-2018T00:10:39,Mippy,"Some of us casually, others more serious."

03-11-2018T00:11:04,SpazztasticKiwi,And that was not towards Mip
03-11-2018T00:11:11,Mippy,Ok
03-11-2018T00:11:28,Mippy,I kind of figured

03-11-2018T00:11:59,Mippy,No prob

03-11-2018T00:12:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Trying to keep up with Mark’s RDR2
03-11-2018T00:13:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"He’s mentioned it’s probably gonna be a 20 part series, 2 hours an episode"
03-11-2018T00:13:21,SpazztasticKiwi,And I’m only on #4
03-11-2018T00:13:44,Ordithus,That is the latest one
03-11-2018T00:13:51,Mippy,I’m actually listening to Forensic Files. I need to catch up on my YouTube vids.
03-11-2018T00:13:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I know
03-11-2018T00:14:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m trying to keep up so I don’t fall behind
03-11-2018T00:14:12,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s entertaining
03-11-2018T00:14:27,Mippy,I fall behind on everything while I’m at school
03-11-2018T00:14:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Particularly “I just want to make it clear to everyone I did NOT mean to point my gun at the cat”

03-11-2018T00:15:03,Ordithus,That moment was precious
03-11-2018T00:15:09,Mippy,I need to watch this
03-11-2018T00:15:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Youtuber Markiplier

03-11-2018T00:16:10,Mippy,"I am aware of Mark, Kiwi. I’ve been fallowing him about as long as Tom."
03-11-2018T00:16:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok
03-11-2018T00:16:20,Mippy,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
03-11-2018T00:16:32,RimaDraws,yea ive not been that long of a follower but
03-11-2018T00:16:33,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s just not everyone seems to know both of em
03-11-2018T00:16:41,RimaDraws,i know both
03-11-2018T00:17:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Please tell me you’ve seen the Korean candy video
03-11-2018T00:17:42,Mippy,I fallowed both without knowing they were bros. Then I realized that half Korean men with the last name Fischbach are not that common.
03-11-2018T00:18:05,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s a safe conclusion
03-11-2018T00:18:13,RimaDraws,yea i watched it
03-11-2018T00:18:15,Mippy,"Yes, I’ve seen Korean candy."
03-11-2018T00:18:15,RimaDraws,its great
03-11-2018T00:18:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"A piece of art, that video"
03-11-2018T00:19:22,Mippy,I had to watch that one twice... it was all at Mark’s expense really. Hilarious!
03-11-2018T00:19:48,SpazztasticKiwi,“Someone get him a pair of scissors before he burst a bag ope-“ *bag explodes*
03-11-2018T00:20:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Want to know something that ended up bugging me about it tho?
03-11-2018T00:21:15,Ordithus,https://youtu.be/E-ktn3z8RjI?t=5194
03-11-2018T00:21:18,Mippy,Wha?
03-11-2018T00:21:19,SpazztasticKiwi,His hoodie strings were uneven the entire time
03-11-2018T00:22:33,Mippy,I never noticed. I was too busy laughing at Mark calling his relative (?) by the wrong name
03-11-2018T00:23:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark is...an experience
03-11-2018T00:24:16,Mippy,Oh gosh! It’s prid near midnight. I should probably go. Sleep time ya know.

03-11-2018T00:25:09,SpazztasticKiwi,You know I’m wondering how long it’s gonna take Mark to realize he never linked any of his relatives in the video description like he said he would in the video
03-11-2018T00:25:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Not even Tom’s there
03-11-2018T00:25:55,SpazztasticKiwi,That was pristine grammar ^

03-11-2018T11:04:59,Mippy,They are kind of a nessesity when you live in a place where the sun never really gose down in the summer. It just dips below the horizen
03-11-2018T11:05:23,Ordithus,You're that far north?
03-11-2018T11:06:22,Ordithus,"I was in Anchorage last summer, the black out curtains were a necessity.  Sun was setting around 11:30"
03-11-2018T11:06:50,Ordithus,It was fun to hike past 9 pm and only stop because of exhaustion though.
03-11-2018T11:07:24,Mippy,Pretty much. In the winter te sun dose not come up fully untill around 10-11am...and starts setting again around 3-4pm.
03-11-2018T11:08:30,Mippy,It took awhile to get use to when I first moved here. Summer is great when you can be at the river at 9pm and it's brod dayligt

03-11-2018T16:57:24,BluePhantom90,Well if Tom is giving all Keidran the same animal biology as this world. Tigers can be pregnant for 100 days. BUT due to stress it could be longer.

03-11-2018T18:29:17,MarshallMelon,Plus number 3 is huge
03-11-2018T18:29:17,ThingsAreMoving,8hrs is not that uncommon i think
03-11-2018T18:29:31,Bgrmystr2,"according to picarto, tom's streamed for like 300 hours so.."
03-11-2018T18:29:35,Ordithus,This is adorkable <3

03-11-2018T18:29:45,HobbitGames,And i think numver 5 might take.... a little longer than necessary
03-11-2018T18:29:54,THETOXICATOR,I coun on a 5h 15min stream
03-11-2018T18:29:56,Bgrmystr2,"not likely, hobbit"

03-11-2018T18:30:04,GhostPack24,Sarry for being afk what is going on?
03-11-2018T18:30:11,totallynotTrace,in general the average for sunday sketches in roughly 9 PM but its common for it to go for hours more
03-11-2018T18:30:12,ZephyrTWolffox,Seen it happen\
03-11-2018T18:30:13,Ordithus,#3 is probably the most time consuming piece today

03-11-2018T18:30:19,ThingsAreMoving,honestly I'd be happy if Tom skipped #3 and moved on to Raine&Kat

03-11-2018T18:30:28,BadFoMo,I think it's that last one in the video list.
03-11-2018T18:30:32,ThingsAreMoving,that #3 will take loooooooong time to finish

03-11-2018T18:42:39,HobbitGames,Hahaha
03-11-2018T18:42:39,TerraTheWizard,:thinking:
03-11-2018T18:42:42,Bgrmystr2,I don't actually know Q
03-11-2018T18:42:45,Wyvern088,thats about right
03-11-2018T18:42:47,Mippy,"Ok, that clears it up."
03-11-2018T18:42:48,ThingsAreMoving,Q from star trek?
03-11-2018T18:42:59,unsteddyphoenix,Or jamesbond
03-11-2018T18:43:00,Bgrmystr2,other than from the James Bond movies

03-11-2018T18:43:45,Bgrmystr2,"Probably Q, Prose"

03-11-2018T18:43:54,ProsePro7,Ah of course
03-11-2018T18:43:55,Bgrmystr2,"no that's a different guy, Issus"

03-11-2018T18:44:01,Bgrmystr2,family twin
03-11-2018T18:44:06,MarshallMelon,TNG to be specific
03-11-2018T18:44:11,ZephyrTWolffox,Delancy
03-11-2018T18:44:15,Issus,I'm not sure what is going on in this prank.
03-11-2018T18:44:15,ThingsAreMoving,Voyager too
03-11-2018T18:44:24,ProsePro7,I still remember when Q first met Q that was a good episode
03-11-2018T18:44:29,Issus,Swapped personalities I think?
03-11-2018T18:44:30,totallynotTrace,Q is also is voyager and Deep space 9
03-11-2018T18:44:41,Bgrmystr2,body swap
03-11-2018T18:44:44,ProsePro7,Q is Star Trek
03-11-2018T18:44:46,THETOXICATOR,It's 00:43 and I can't stop watching
03-11-2018T18:44:46,Bgrmystr2,or mind swap lol
03-11-2018T18:44:48,Bgrmystr2,either way
03-11-2018T18:44:57,ThingsAreMoving,"Toxicator, that's normal"
03-11-2018T18:44:59,Xexanoth,Still my favourite Q scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_0dgKgSDgo
03-11-2018T18:44:59,Wyvern088,no one wanted to see rule 63 Picard TBH
03-11-2018T18:45:00,HobbitGames,I never understood hoe so many star trek series were made.
03-11-2018T18:45:02,totallynotTrace,technichally Q is a race of gods
03-11-2018T18:45:03,Issus,Have to wonder which is now Keith.
03-11-2018T18:45:12,totallynotTrace,not just one god
03-11-2018T18:45:15,Bgrmystr2,"Keith is in Natani's body, Issus"
03-11-2018T18:45:18,Bgrmystr2,it's fairly obvious
03-11-2018T18:45:22,ProsePro7,Me personally I think Nora is more Discord than Q
03-11-2018T18:45:25,Issus,I mean who is in Keith's...
03-11-2018T18:45:27,ThingsAreMoving,Look in their eyeeeeeees
03-11-2018T18:45:31,Bgrmystr2,Natani..? duh
03-11-2018T18:45:43,ZephyrTWolffox,hurrr
03-11-2018T18:45:44,ThingsAreMoving,Natani is Roberto
03-11-2018T18:45:48,Mippy,It’s obvious Issus
03-11-2018T18:45:48,Issus,The cendescention is pretty unnecessary though.
03-11-2018T18:45:50,Ordithus,There is no Natani there is only Zuul
03-11-2018T18:45:51,Bgrmystr2,..yes things
03-11-2018T18:45:52,ShadowSoap,The eyes are the doorways to one's soul
03-11-2018T18:45:54,totallynotTrace,they are The Q and the one ass that keeps interfering with humans goes by the name Q
03-11-2018T18:45:55,MarshallMelon,The main thing I'm taking away from this is that Nora needs to be voiced by John DeLancie in the anime
03-11-2018T18:46:24,HobbitGames,Who would you cast as the others?
03-11-2018T18:46:33,Xexanoth,Q and Discord were basicially the same character
03-11-2018T18:46:39,MarshallMelon,Also John DeLancie
03-11-2018T18:46:42,totallynotTrace,yes
03-11-2018T18:46:46,MarshallMelon,Doing celebrity impressions

03-11-2018T18:48:15,ProsePro7,Thank you
03-11-2018T18:48:22,ThingsAreMoving,"3 seconds after the mind swap, the waters broke And trace felt getting kicked in the nuts wasn't too painful compared to childbirth."
03-11-2018T18:48:28,HobbitGames,Thanks for the welcome marv
03-11-2018T18:48:31,ProsePro7,I couldnt remember if it was Dr. or Professor
03-11-2018T18:48:51,HobbitGames,Getting kicked in the balls is the most painful thing ever
03-11-2018T18:49:07,ShadowSoap,Mothers would argue against that
03-11-2018T18:49:08,AFallingTree,agreed
03-11-2018T18:49:16,HobbitGames,"Because it o ly starts after a few secs, giving you time to comprehend what happened"
03-11-2018T18:49:22,THETOXICATOR,I'm cursed with obsession
03-11-2018T18:49:23,ThingsAreMoving,try getting a chopstick forced under your fingernail then
03-11-2018T18:49:26,ShadowSoap,But it's a debate that can't really be ended
03-11-2018T18:49:33,MarshallMelon,Kidney stones folks. Not even once.
03-11-2018T18:49:40,Xexanoth,it's also a different kind of pain i imagine
03-11-2018T18:49:42,TerraTheWizard,i thought the pain debate ended when someone mentioned kidney stones
03-11-2018T18:49:43,RimaDraws,my dad has one now and he's hurting bad
03-11-2018T18:49:52,RimaDraws,he may have to have surgery if this one don't pass
03-11-2018T18:50:05,ZephyrTWolffox,rock pee
03-11-2018T18:50:05,ShadowSoap,Wow...that sucks
03-11-2018T18:50:10,TerraTheWizard,oof
03-11-2018T18:50:16,MarshallMelon,I mean technically Cluster Migraines are considered the end-all when it comes to pain but they're super rare.
03-11-2018T18:50:22,Dimensional,Huh. Trace's eyes are the same color as Natanis.
03-11-2018T18:50:30,Dimensional,"Er, Keith."
03-11-2018T18:50:42,ThingsAreMoving,I'm fortunate that I only suffer from regular migraines
03-11-2018T18:50:48,Wyvern088,does anyone know if Tom has posted any tutorials on his color process? I wish I could see some of the UI and what he does with layers
03-11-2018T18:50:49,RimaDraws,no they aren't dimensional
03-11-2018T18:50:51,Bgrmystr2,"@ShadowSoap mothers can argue against that, but it's not like they have any to be able to feel the difference. Hence why the debate exists"
03-11-2018T18:50:53,Twokinds,I've never had a kidney stone before. And I never will!
03-11-2018T18:50:59,ThingsAreMoving,and I can tell when they're coming so I can take painkillers before
03-11-2018T18:51:00,Ordithus,"Now wouldn't that be weird.  Keith into Trace, Flora into Natani."
03-11-2018T18:51:02,Dimensional,"Don't jinx it, Tom!"
03-11-2018T18:51:05,Xexanoth,"wouldn't exactly call that ""fortunate"" @Things"
03-11-2018T18:51:08,Ordithus,Extra twist

03-11-2018T19:49:09,RimaDraws,but i am grateful to have them cause my cousins step daughter has breast cancer
03-11-2018T19:49:29,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s social norms that say you shouldn’t so therefore you “cant”

03-11-2018T19:51:29,Mippy,"Oh, you can tell when I use it. I look like something out of a Tim Burton movie"
03-11-2018T19:51:30,unsteddyphoenix,Eyeliners terrifying though
03-11-2018T19:51:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Men’s cologne seems to last longer
03-11-2018T19:51:38,unsteddyphoenix,Have to get it riiight in there
03-11-2018T19:51:54,SpazztasticKiwi,You put on perfume and it’s gone before you walk out the door
03-11-2018T19:52:01,Bgrmystr2,"prolly cuz of the stereotype that men get sweatier faster and more often, Kiwi"
03-11-2018T19:52:03,RimaDraws,i freaking hate axe deodorant
03-11-2018T19:52:07,ThingsAreMoving,"Oh it's there, trust me"
03-11-2018T19:52:07,unsteddyphoenix,Well a lot of guys drown themselves in it
03-11-2018T19:52:10,Bgrmystr2,so they make it last longer
03-11-2018T19:52:17,Bgrmystr2,"and yeah that too, what phoenix said"
03-11-2018T19:52:23,ThingsAreMoving,just cause you can't smell it doesn't mean other people can't
03-11-2018T19:52:28,RimaDraws,its so nasty
03-11-2018T19:52:29,ShadowSoap,Axe is like modern chemical warfare
03-11-2018T19:52:31,ZephyrTWolffox,I get hives from it tho
03-11-2018T19:52:39,SpazztasticKiwi,“Nice cologne. How long did you marinate in it?”
03-11-2018T19:52:39,Ordithus,Raine is squoosh
03-11-2018T19:52:42,Xexanoth,*blep*
03-11-2018T19:52:46,Bgrmystr2,"the older guy that lives here drowns himself in it and it's so strong you can taste it, so"
03-11-2018T19:52:49,Bgrmystr2,yeah there are people.
03-11-2018T19:53:00,RimaDraws,and there are people who don't bathe and use it
03-11-2018T19:53:04,RimaDraws,thats even worse
03-11-2018T19:53:09,unsteddyphoenix,Yup~
03-11-2018T19:53:10,ShadowSoap,Ech
03-11-2018T19:53:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah if I can taste it I’m tempted to take a water hose to you
03-11-2018T19:53:14,unsteddyphoenix,Its NOT a substitute
03-11-2018T19:53:23,AFallingTree,perfume is not a shower
03-11-2018T19:53:23,RimaDraws,ty
03-11-2018T19:53:25,ShadowSoap,Is that NOT common knowledge?
03-11-2018T19:53:34,ThingsAreMoving,but soap and water is so expensive!
03-11-2018T19:53:41,SpazztasticKiwi,There should be serving suggestions on the bottles
03-11-2018T19:53:46,Mippy,We had a customer like that. I’m pretty sure he was a border. Earned the nickname “stinky man”
03-11-2018T19:53:49,ShadowSoap,"Actually, i'm quite inexpensive"
03-11-2018T19:53:54,RimaDraws,i use the cheap perfume from cato fashions and its $5 for nice smelling perfume
03-11-2018T19:53:57,Xexanoth,"technicially speaking, cologne used to be a bath substitute, because heating water was hard"
03-11-2018T19:54:02,SpazztasticKiwi,But there is an Axe line that smells like chocolate and the Gold one is good too
03-11-2018T19:54:04,Mippy,*horder
03-11-2018T19:54:05,unsteddyphoenix,Economical
03-11-2018T19:54:07,ThingsAreMoving,You're just a shadow of a soap
03-11-2018T19:54:09,Xexanoth,"then again, only rich people could afford cologne"
03-11-2018T19:54:16,ThingsAreMoving,"Can't wash with that, can you?"
03-11-2018T19:54:20,RimaDraws,i have like three bottles of perfume
03-11-2018T19:54:22,ShadowSoap,True...true
03-11-2018T19:54:23,Vexd,Its easy for forget how much hair Raine has
03-11-2018T19:54:30,RimaDraws,and they're mild compared to some strong stuff
03-11-2018T19:54:45,Ordithus,So much hair.  Especially in woofer mode
03-11-2018T19:54:55,RimaDraws,its not that they're for every occasion but its when i feel im in the mood for
03-11-2018T19:55:15,SpazztasticKiwi,You know that “ladies spray perfume where they want to be kissed”?
03-11-2018T19:55:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Bs
03-11-2018T19:55:25,RimaDraws,that is bs
03-11-2018T19:55:25,ThingsAreMoving,I prefer to use a little perfume rather than deodorant or cologne
03-11-2018T19:55:29,unsteddyphoenix,"Lol, why would you do that"
03-11-2018T19:55:29,RimaDraws,i put it on my neck
03-11-2018T19:55:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Have you never accidentally tasted perfume

03-11-2018T19:55:40,SpazztasticKiwi,You will not want to kiss it
03-11-2018T19:55:48,ThingsAreMoving,I drank cologne at some point in my life

03-11-2018T21:48:20,ThingsAreMoving,the best comparison I can muster is slightly spiced up thawed vanilla ice cream

03-11-2018T21:51:06,ThingsAreMoving,Also if you live in a place where it gets really cold during the winter
03-11-2018T21:51:25,ThingsAreMoving,spiced mulled wine is the best thing to warm yourself up
03-11-2018T21:51:38,RimaDraws,ooh
03-11-2018T21:51:42,RimaDraws,but i don't like wine lol
03-11-2018T21:51:45,RimaDraws,i might try it
03-11-2018T21:51:52,ThingsAreMoving,"sweet wine with cloves, cinnamon, allspice, slice of orange and honey"
03-11-2018T21:52:03,RimaDraws,oh that sounds good

03-11-2018T21:52:21,unsteddyphoenix,Oooh~
03-11-2018T21:52:27,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds extremely warming
03-11-2018T21:52:32,ThingsAreMoving,Works with beer too
03-11-2018T21:52:37,ThingsAreMoving,lager preferably
03-11-2018T21:53:38,ThingsAreMoving,if you ever try it just heat half of your wine/beer with the spices and once it barely starts to simmer add the rest and strain
03-11-2018T21:54:01,RimaDraws,i had a hot tottie once
03-11-2018T21:54:03,unsteddyphoenix,seems simple enough
03-11-2018T21:54:04,ThingsAreMoving,Drink from a clay tankard or some other poor heat conductive mug
03-11-2018T21:54:05,RimaDraws,it did not taste good

03-11-2018T21:54:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d try it and maybe some spiked nog but
03-11-2018T21:54:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t go to parties or gather with friends. And this place is more for beer
03-11-2018T21:55:10,RimaDraws,i was sick new years eve and i had a cold so i decided to get some hot tea and pour honey jack daniels in it
03-11-2018T21:55:16,RimaDraws,second time around i poured too much
03-11-2018T21:55:33,ThingsAreMoving,"Eh, it's three in the morning here. Gotta bounce off to bed before I destroy my sleep cycle."

03-11-2018T22:56:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Bone related
03-11-2018T22:59:43,Dadrobit,Loaded back to April so far. The Tab is slowing down considerably....
03-11-2018T22:59:51,Ordithus,:fire:
03-11-2018T23:10:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Is progress still in
03-11-2018T23:11:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera is on vibrate
03-11-2018T23:12:13,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-sleepoverA:
03-11-2018T23:12:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"Vibrate, not near spontaneous combustion"
03-11-2018T23:13:06,Ordithus,Probably for the best
03-11-2018T23:13:18,SpazztasticKiwi,“Probably”
03-11-2018T23:13:35,Ordithus,99.999%
03-11-2018T23:15:50,unsteddyphoenix,thats pretty probable
03-11-2018T23:37:25,totallynotTrace,a few weeks ago i scrolled patreon and getting to december was difficult but then it crashed the page
03-11-2018T23:37:46,Ordithus,I wish they had a functional search
03-11-2018T23:37:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Loading too much sexy crashes Patreon
03-11-2018T23:38:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Got it
03-11-2018T23:38:15,unsteddyphoenix,the real reason they paywall
03-11-2018T23:38:32,totallynotTrace,i wish they were more optimized
03-11-2018T23:39:02,totallynotTrace,like have a option to use thumbnails not near full sized pictures
03-11-2018T23:39:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,wish their was a competitor
03-11-2018T23:43:02,totallynotTrace,using page down on my keyboard is faster than scrolling on patreon
03-11-2018T23:52:47,totallynotTrace,"so im back as far as march 3rd and hitting ""load more"" makes that one chrome tab use 40%of my cpu and its using 600 mb ram."
03-11-2018T23:54:17,Dadrobit,Through sorting about 100 sketches. Unsteddy and Fence are tied at 5 so far.
03-11-2018T23:55:42,unsteddyphoenix,"Damn, thats some commitment"
03-11-2018T23:55:51,unsteddyphoenix,from what time period?
03-11-2018T23:55:59,totallynotTrace,i think im back to feb and its not loading when i hit load more
03-11-2018T23:56:46,Twokinds,"When going back in time on the Patreon, it's easier to just go month by month in the filter options."
03-11-2018T23:56:53,Twokinds,"At least, I've found."
03-11-2018T23:56:59,Ordithus,^ tips with Tom
03-11-2018T23:57:08,RimaDraws,hm?
03-11-2018T23:57:13,totallynotTrace,NO. I WANT A TEST
03-11-2018T23:57:35,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah it does seem better that way
03-11-2018T23:57:40,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-sadtrace2::fire::computer::fire:
03-11-2018T23:57:48,totallynotTrace,im back as far as feb 31 and the framerate on that window is real LOW
03-11-2018T23:57:49,unsteddyphoenix,Though it's hard to remember what sketch was which month
03-11-2018T23:57:56,Twokinds,That way you don't end up with a huuuge page that might glitch out at any moment and make you start all over again.
03-11-2018T23:58:31,RimaDraws,i label all my files
03-11-2018T23:58:34,GhostPack24,I am back
03-11-2018T23:58:40,totallynotTrace,but that wouldnt be a challenge
03-11-2018T23:58:49,RimaDraws,um not really
03-11-2018T23:58:55,RimaDraws,not if you do it the day you finish
03-11-2018T23:59:02,totallynotTrace,oop the circle stopped spinning :/
03-11-2018T23:59:03,RimaDraws,i do it
03-11-2018T23:59:03,Twokinds,"I wish they hadn't done away with the pages. I know the infinit scrolling thing is popular, but I don't really get why. Just seems to get completely unwieldy after a while."
03-11-2018T23:59:17,Twokinds,Twitter's the same way. Go too far and it just messes up after a while.
03-11-2018T23:59:18,GhostPack24,*Gasp* Trace😠
03-11-2018T23:59:38,GhostPack24,Hi😊
03-11-2018T23:59:54,RimaDraws,twitter is crap sometimes
