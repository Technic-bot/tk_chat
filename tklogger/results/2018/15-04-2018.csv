15-04-2018T00:00:17,Vatruvius,Wait...why?
15-04-2018T00:00:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Kinda like if I ever developed telekinesis
15-04-2018T00:00:41,Vatruvius,I see...
15-04-2018T00:01:15,SpazztasticKiwi,A procrastinator can do 8 hours of work in 30 minutes and 30 minutes of work in 8 hours
15-04-2018T00:01:51,SpazztasticKiwi,But when I get focused on something...I get it done
15-04-2018T00:02:07,unsteddyphoenix,See I just have the first bit.
15-04-2018T00:02:09,unsteddyphoenix,Am jealous
15-04-2018T00:02:10,Twokinds,"Well, unsteddy is in the future"
15-04-2018T00:02:20,unsteddyphoenix,Hey thats true.
15-04-2018T00:02:27,Vatruvius,lol
15-04-2018T00:02:43,Vatruvius,Could not be more accurate with that statement Kiwi.
15-04-2018T00:02:54,unsteddyphoenix,It's far less convenient that you'd think
15-04-2018T00:03:12,Vatruvius,All those flashbacks to those English essays and projects...
15-04-2018T00:03:54,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-natanisleep: Night folks!

15-04-2018T00:07:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Night night don‚Äôt let the nightmares bite
15-04-2018T00:07:46,TheBeckoner,Night Ord
15-04-2018T00:07:55,Vatruvius,There are a few people here now that might be able to answer this question...has sketch been done involving peanut butter?
15-04-2018T00:08:09,Vatruvius,any sketch*
15-04-2018T00:08:15,TheBeckoner,I am unsure
15-04-2018T00:08:48,unsteddyphoenix,No. there hasnt..im nervous about that question.
15-04-2018T00:09:08,Vatruvius,Why so nervous unsteddy?
15-04-2018T00:09:09,Bgrmystr2,not that I know of
15-04-2018T00:10:43,Vatruvius,:rofl:
15-04-2018T00:10:50,Vatruvius,I can't
15-04-2018T00:10:53,Vatruvius,I just cant
15-04-2018T00:11:02,Vatruvius,can't*
15-04-2018T00:11:43,TheBeckoner,cant wot
15-04-2018T00:12:22,Vatruvius,I am just watching Acq. Inc. and it is just too damn funny.
15-04-2018T00:13:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Last night I watched a video that was quite the trip
15-04-2018T00:14:05,Vatruvius,What was it?
15-04-2018T00:14:29,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúTo This Day project‚Äù

15-04-2018T00:15:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you were ever called a name in school, it‚Äôll hit you"
15-04-2018T00:17:14,Vatruvius,I started to watch it...was not called a name but might as well have thrown that on top of everything else.
15-04-2018T00:18:01,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha no way
15-04-2018T00:18:04,unsteddyphoenix,karate chops
15-04-2018T00:18:30,unsteddyphoenix,Why would he get sent to someone over a bruise
15-04-2018T00:19:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"It was a misunderstanding. Unfortunately that led to a nickname, that though harmless on the surface, became a weight later"
15-04-2018T00:20:14,unsteddyphoenix,Hard to believe
15-04-2018T00:20:19,unsteddyphoenix,This sounds like a slam poem
15-04-2018T00:20:27,SpazztasticKiwi,It is a poem
15-04-2018T00:21:01,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs part of an anti bullying campaign
15-04-2018T00:21:57,unsteddyphoenix,s'not bad
15-04-2018T00:21:58,SpazztasticKiwi,And it is very believable. Something similar happened to me in middle school. A tiny misunderstanding created a rumor that ended up screwing with my school life
15-04-2018T00:23:53,unsteddyphoenix,really?
15-04-2018T00:24:08,unsteddyphoenix,"Its just weird 'cause like, kids get bruised all the time"
15-04-2018T00:24:32,unsteddyphoenix,He got called up over one bruise one time? Are we really that jumpy nowadays?
15-04-2018T00:24:40,Vatruvius,That was the work of someone who had plenty of first hand experience...I know what that is like. Any for of bullying hurts...and it hurts deep like he said.  It is a hard thing to get over.
15-04-2018T00:25:10,Vatruvius,I would not be surprised.
15-04-2018T00:25:23,Vatruvius,form* not for
15-04-2018T00:25:35,unsteddyphoenix,Nah this was written by a team of people
15-04-2018T00:25:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Does that diminish the work?
15-04-2018T00:26:18,unsteddyphoenix,Nah im just saying I doubt its one persons personal experience
15-04-2018T00:26:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you watch it, it tells multiple stories, so no it‚Äôs not from one person"
15-04-2018T00:26:58,Vatruvius,From what I have seen...it very well could be. Years of bullying from school to school...it could be one persons experiences.
15-04-2018T00:27:38,Vatruvius,Granted...it was multiple stories but it very easily could be one person's story. That much does happen.
15-04-2018T00:29:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I think the girl with the birthmark was a kindergarten friend of the speaker
15-04-2018T00:30:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause he mentions that the first time she was called ugly was when ‚Äúthey‚Äù were 3
15-04-2018T00:30:24,Vatruvius,Yeah...sounded like they either got together later on or remained close throughout life.
15-04-2018T00:30:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚ÄúDespite a loving husband, she doesn‚Äôt see herself as beautiful‚Äù"
15-04-2018T00:31:20,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúAll because of a birthmark that takes up less than half of her face‚Äù
15-04-2018T00:31:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Sounds like they‚Äôre still friends. She may even be a part of the project
15-04-2018T00:32:03,Vatruvius,Yeah...kids are just cruel. What is worse is when parents say toughen up and the adults do nothing about it.
15-04-2018T00:32:08,Vatruvius,I agree Kiwi.
15-04-2018T00:33:22,Vatruvius,Oh boy...that brings back a lot of memories. Just gonna...step out for a bit.
15-04-2018T00:33:36,Twokinds,It looks like Vol 4 preorders are going to start this week
15-04-2018T00:33:50,NightMeaty22,This is why i hate school because i have to go though stuff like this this
15-04-2018T00:34:00,NightMeaty22,All day
15-04-2018T00:34:09,unsteddyphoenix,Oh cool!
15-04-2018T00:34:45,Vatruvius,I am ecstatic about the preorders!
15-04-2018T00:35:36,Vatruvius,And I am sorry that is happening to you Meaty. Just realize that you are not alone...I have gone through stuff like that and so have many others. You are not alone.
15-04-2018T00:35:56,unsteddyphoenix,"How long will the preorder ""phase"" last?"
15-04-2018T00:36:30,NightMeaty22,I try to think i'm not but it really feels like it
15-04-2018T00:36:32,Twokinds,"Right now they're telling me it'll ship ""summer"""
15-04-2018T00:36:44,Twokinds,So probably July / August
15-04-2018T00:36:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Whoo
15-04-2018T00:37:33,unsteddyphoenix,And the preorders start now? Woah.
15-04-2018T00:38:10,Twokinds,"I can't tell if you mean woah as in, that's far away or that's soon"
15-04-2018T00:38:24,DRAGONTANOPUG,We talkin 2020
15-04-2018T00:38:45,unsteddyphoenix,It seems far away to me. How long does processing orders take? I have no idea what the process is.
15-04-2018T00:38:56,DRAGONTANOPUG,What chapters will vol. 4 have?
15-04-2018T00:39:32,Twokinds,It's the second half of the Basitin island arc
15-04-2018T00:39:43,Twokinds,So it goes until they leave the island.
15-04-2018T00:40:17,Vatruvius,Catching up Tom.
15-04-2018T00:40:18,DRAGONTANOPUG,Then vol. 5 is the travel back?
15-04-2018T00:40:46,Twokinds,"...no, it's chapter 2 again"
15-04-2018T00:40:58,DRAGONTANOPUG,Oh
15-04-2018T00:41:05,unsteddyphoenix,Obviously
15-04-2018T00:41:07,DRAGONTANOPUG,üòë
15-04-2018T00:41:17,Vatruvius,What? :ptv-wondering:
15-04-2018T00:41:25,Vatruvius,Is that sarcastic Tom?
15-04-2018T00:41:27,unsteddyphoenix,re-release book one
15-04-2018T00:41:39,DRAGONTANOPUG,Vol.5 is going to be chapter 2
15-04-2018T00:41:53,Vatruvius,The pre-orders will be on the store link on the comic page right?
15-04-2018T00:42:18,DRAGONTANOPUG,Dont you get a poster if you pre order
15-04-2018T00:42:38,Vatruvius,I am really confused...why would vol. 5 book go back to a previous chapter in the series?
15-04-2018T00:42:48,DRAGONTANOPUG,Hes trollinh
15-04-2018T00:42:56,Vatruvius,I figured as much...
15-04-2018T00:43:03,Vatruvius,:ptv-angry:
15-04-2018T00:43:09,unsteddyphoenix,you really should...not have been fooled by that.
15-04-2018T00:43:13,Vatruvius,:ptv-uneasy:
15-04-2018T00:43:21,DRAGONTANOPUG,Isnt the raine poster inclided with pre orders
15-04-2018T00:43:29,Vatruvius,I was on the fence about it unsteddy.
15-04-2018T00:43:30,DRAGONTANOPUG,Included*
15-04-2018T00:44:00,Vatruvius,Then DRAGON reinforced it...by source to pick for reinforcement.
15-04-2018T00:44:26,DRAGONTANOPUG,Did you not see the emoji
15-04-2018T00:44:34,DRAGONTANOPUG,üòë
15-04-2018T00:44:56,Twokinds,"No, not this time"
15-04-2018T00:45:04,Twokinds,You get a signed print.
15-04-2018T00:45:07,Vatruvius,Nope! :ptv-confused:
15-04-2018T00:45:15,DRAGONTANOPUG,Really
15-04-2018T00:45:20,Twokinds,"Well, the first 400 or so people get a signed print. Then they run out."
15-04-2018T00:45:41,Vatruvius,Really!? I better order as soon as they are available then.
15-04-2018T00:46:02,DRAGONTANOPUG,What time do preorders released this week!?
15-04-2018T00:46:05,Vatruvius,But...I thought all pre-orders get the Raine Signature Print?
15-04-2018T00:46:27,DRAGONTANOPUG,Im getting a signed print
15-04-2018T00:46:29,DRAGONTANOPUG,Watch me
15-04-2018T00:46:33,Twokinds,"I mean, I can only send a finite number"
15-04-2018T00:46:47,Twokinds,I have to sign them all and send them to keenspot ahead of time
15-04-2018T00:47:15,Vatruvius,"You mean you do not want to sign 10,000+ pieces of work?"
15-04-2018T00:47:23,Vatruvius,Like your brother?
15-04-2018T00:47:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Signing something 400 times. Have fun

15-04-2018T00:49:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"Yeah. The charity part‚Äôs wonderful, but it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôd want around my house"
15-04-2018T00:49:42,unsteddyphoenix,Did mark sign all those?

15-04-2018T00:51:02,DRAGONTANOPUG,Im going to go sell my soul so i can buy the preorder.
15-04-2018T00:51:15,Vatruvius,And he strikes me as someone who will gladly sign all those for that type of charity.
15-04-2018T00:51:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera‚Äôs sleeping with an eye open and dreaming

15-04-2018T01:07:51,unsteddyphoenix,See this is where i'd apply that Kat face
15-04-2018T01:07:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera just stepped on my throat
15-04-2018T01:08:03,unsteddyphoenix,^could be worse
15-04-2018T01:08:18,SpazztasticKiwi,My cats are taught the laptop is not a place to lay
15-04-2018T01:08:33,SpazztasticKiwi,So they lay on me instead
15-04-2018T01:08:37,Vatruvius,lol
15-04-2018T01:08:38,unsteddyphoenix,Dealing with a DOG when youre tired is hard
15-04-2018T01:08:54,unsteddyphoenix,Cats just wander around and flop onto warm places where is the difficulty
15-04-2018T01:09:08,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre watching and I don‚Äôt care. Pay attention to me‚Äù
15-04-2018T01:09:25,Twokinds,Well that's why I'd never have a dog.
15-04-2018T01:09:51,SpazztasticKiwi,That and the allergy thing?
15-04-2018T01:09:57,NightMeaty22,Welp i gota get some sleep
15-04-2018T01:10:00,Twokinds,I'm not alergic to dogs.
15-04-2018T01:10:08,unsteddyphoenix,tragic
15-04-2018T01:10:13,Vatruvius,I found it Kiwi...let me just get the time stamp.
15-04-2018T01:10:15,NightMeaty22,Cya
15-04-2018T01:10:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Ah
15-04-2018T01:10:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Well then
15-04-2018T01:10:24,unsteddyphoenix,o/
15-04-2018T01:11:14,SpazztasticKiwi,In hindsight that‚Äôs probably best
15-04-2018T01:11:19,MisterWho,hmmm...what are ppl doing who don't have a cat but a cheetah? Africa parks can be fun. :D
15-04-2018T01:11:24,unsteddyphoenix,My friend got a husky puppy. Really cute but no idea how you could live with it
15-04-2018T01:11:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Huskies are known to be like toddlers
15-04-2018T01:11:47,unsteddyphoenix,Spent at least a few minutes gnawing on my arm.
15-04-2018T01:12:04,MisterWho,love gnawing i hope
15-04-2018T01:12:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"I like smaller breeds, but not if they‚Äôre yappy"
15-04-2018T01:12:12,Twokinds,Still don't know what I want Colin to be.
15-04-2018T01:12:24,unsteddyphoenix,I thought you had that all sorted!
15-04-2018T01:12:32,unsteddyphoenix,Or at least...mostly.
15-04-2018T01:12:34,Twokinds,"I CAN""T DECIDE1"
15-04-2018T01:12:46,MisterWho,Make a list and take a D20 ;)
15-04-2018T01:12:51,Vatruvius,"""Give it more time, you cannot rush art"" says angry fans. :ptv-hearts:"
15-04-2018T01:13:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Bronze
15-04-2018T01:13:15,unsteddyphoenix,Have you like...narrowed it down at least?
15-04-2018T01:13:50,Twokinds,Brown
15-04-2018T01:14:06,Vatruvius,Earthy tones...yes!
15-04-2018T01:14:34,unsteddyphoenix,"ok, hm...thats...something."
15-04-2018T01:14:52,SpazztasticKiwi,What shade of brown
15-04-2018T01:14:57,SpazztasticKiwi,That is the question
15-04-2018T01:15:17,unsteddyphoenix,"Is ""gold"" a shade of brown or shade of yellow :thinking:"
15-04-2018T01:15:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Depends on the amount of yellow and/or brown in it
15-04-2018T01:15:57,unsteddyphoenix,What a neutral answer
15-04-2018T01:16:39,Twokinds,I think it's blue and black
15-04-2018T01:16:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I thought you just said brown
15-04-2018T01:16:57,unsteddyphoenix,lol
15-04-2018T01:17:25,unsteddyphoenix,That dress was an experience
15-04-2018T01:17:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Does messing with us come with the job or do you do that for fun
15-04-2018T01:17:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"But no, it was white and gold"
15-04-2018T01:17:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Totally
15-04-2018T01:17:58,unsteddyphoenix,Oi it was though.
15-04-2018T01:18:20,SpazztasticKiwi,The original picture was revealed to be blue and black
15-04-2018T01:18:27,unsteddyphoenix,Messing with chat is good practice for in-comic pranks
15-04-2018T01:18:34,SpazztasticKiwi,The gold and white one was altered
15-04-2018T01:18:43,unsteddyphoenix,Pretty sure that was just a rumour
15-04-2018T01:19:24,unsteddyphoenix,dont think it was actually shopped
15-04-2018T01:19:37,SpazztasticKiwi,It was ridiculous regardless
15-04-2018T01:20:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"But on Colin‚Äôs coloring, are we looking at dark brown tones, light brown tones, or dark with light bronzers and highlights"
15-04-2018T01:20:57,Twokinds,IDEALLY
15-04-2018T01:21:04,Twokinds,"I'd want him to be a light, single color"
15-04-2018T01:21:43,Vatruvius,Like...all the fur is one color like Natani or Keith?
15-04-2018T01:22:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Light mocha?
15-04-2018T01:22:15,unsteddyphoenix,"Lighter is better, stops him getting confused with others"
15-04-2018T01:22:17,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs a bit pale though
15-04-2018T01:22:47,unsteddyphoenix,I suppose there's no real reason he'd have to be two-toned...
15-04-2018T01:23:21,unsteddyphoenix,You could mock up some choices and then like...ask for opinions?
15-04-2018T01:24:09,Vatruvius,Like...a line of different Colin's and patreon vote/opinion?
15-04-2018T01:24:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"We‚Äôre not picking a prom dress, people"
15-04-2018T01:25:07,unsteddyphoenix,Probably not that official
15-04-2018T01:25:21,Vatruvius,That is exactly what we are doing Kiwi. :ptv-hearts:
15-04-2018T01:25:36,unsteddyphoenix,A vote would imply he'd HAVE to pick the winning colour
15-04-2018T01:25:42,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúThat one makes his butt look too big‚Äù
15-04-2018T01:25:53,unsteddyphoenix,I think it always looks big!
15-04-2018T01:26:37,SpazztasticKiwi,What about a new-penny copper color?
15-04-2018T01:26:44,Vatruvius,Maybe a patreon lean...he does not have to pick the winner but gets an idea of what not to pick.
15-04-2018T01:27:28,Vatruvius,Though it is his view and not ours so...our input probably will not help. It is not what Tom is looking for...but I would like to help if we could.
15-04-2018T01:28:04,Twokinds,No I'm not going to make it a patreon vote
15-04-2018T01:28:19,Vatruvius,I felt like the tans/earthy tones paired well with Sam's blonde hair.
15-04-2018T01:28:23,SpazztasticKiwi,What‚Äôs his personality? It could be a shade of brown based on how sweet-tempered he is
15-04-2018T01:28:33,Twokinds,He's nice
15-04-2018T01:28:40,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúNice‚Äù
15-04-2018T01:28:48,SpazztasticKiwi,That narrows it down
15-04-2018T01:28:50,Twokinds,He's painfully naive and self-concious.
15-04-2018T01:29:04,Twokinds,He's like a dog. A little dim but lovable.
15-04-2018T01:29:46,Vatruvius,Would have to be a warm color then.
15-04-2018T01:29:59,Vatruvius,Not too dark a brown but not too light.
15-04-2018T01:30:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Tortilla brown maybe
15-04-2018T01:30:20,SpazztasticKiwi,And I don‚Äôt mean the food
15-04-2018T01:30:42,Twokinds,hungry
15-04-2018T01:30:57,Vatruvius,Why did you have to say tortilla Kiwi...WHY!
15-04-2018T01:31:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Go get a snack then. Your legs aren‚Äôt broken
15-04-2018T01:31:50,Twokinds,I can't.
15-04-2018T01:31:52,Twokinds,Diet.
15-04-2018T01:32:12,SpazztasticKiwi,A snack of fruit or something then
15-04-2018T01:32:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Popcorn if it‚Äôs not smothered in butter and salt
15-04-2018T01:33:07,Vatruvius,I have a portion problem...I like a food and go back for more. Though now I am trying to lose weight so I am significantly slicing my portions and going to throw in some exercise.
15-04-2018T01:33:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, I‚Äôd suggest auburn, but it might be too close to Nat‚Äôs coloring"
15-04-2018T01:34:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless you add a smidge more red and gold
15-04-2018T01:34:21,Vatruvius,"Maybe create some versions of Colin and print them out and pin them to the wall...then over time take the ""no's"" down and narrow the selection?"
15-04-2018T01:35:05,unsteddyphoenix,You defintely want it as distinct as possible from other characters
15-04-2018T01:35:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"Then again, there‚Äôs also saddle brown, but that becomes debatable with the amount of variation too"
15-04-2018T01:35:16,Vatruvius,The end result might be a mix between two or three final versions.
15-04-2018T01:35:27,unsteddyphoenix,The last thing I saw was a light gold colour that was pretty good
15-04-2018T01:36:10,SpazztasticKiwi,All the browns I‚Äôm thinking of are food references
15-04-2018T01:36:20,unsteddyphoenix,lol
15-04-2018T01:36:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"Latte, brown sugar"
15-04-2018T01:36:41,Vatruvius,Just...stop Kiwi...before it is too late.
15-04-2018T01:37:33,SpazztasticKiwi,He‚Äôs already making good progress. It‚Äôs good not to go too hard at it all the time
15-04-2018T01:37:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I say as I constantly break my diet
15-04-2018T01:41:39,unsteddyphoenix,"Tbh if you want a lighter shade of brown, id just pick one and continue with that for now. Theres a very limited amount of regret that would come from picking the ""wrong"" one"
15-04-2018T01:42:13,SpazztasticKiwi,But it‚Äôs gotta be PERFECT
15-04-2018T01:42:15,unsteddyphoenix,This type of thing can gum up the works so much. Done enough projects to experience it multiple times
15-04-2018T01:43:16,unsteddyphoenix,Perfection...is an illusion...
15-04-2018T01:43:41,unsteddyphoenix,Unless something happens after the 10000 hour rule cant say about that.
15-04-2018T01:45:33,Vatruvius,Process of elimination until you get something close...then it will kinda take its own once it gets anchored to the character. At least that is what I feel like...I have no experience in the matter.
15-04-2018T01:45:40,unsteddyphoenix,once spent about 5 days of an 8 week project deliberating with someone on the name. Turned out we really needed that time...
15-04-2018T01:46:41,Twokinds,"Yeeeah, I know"
15-04-2018T01:46:49,Twokinds,It doesn't really matter that much...
15-04-2018T01:47:30,unsteddyphoenix,Sometimes it's hard having no time limit to do something
15-04-2018T01:47:33,Twokinds,"But imagine this: If I'd gone with my first choice, Kathrin would be white with black splotches."
15-04-2018T01:47:56,Vatruvius,A snow leapord?
15-04-2018T01:47:57,unsteddyphoenix,What a world that would be...
15-04-2018T01:48:04,Vatruvius,Hmm...
15-04-2018T01:48:36,SpazztasticKiwi,She‚Äôs a type of leopard isn‚Äôt she
15-04-2018T01:48:40,Vatruvius,I am sure whatever your final pick will be Tom...everyone will like it
15-04-2018T01:48:44,unsteddyphoenix,I wonder if that wouldve affected my oddly strong feelings towards that fictional character...
15-04-2018T01:48:54,Vatruvius,Kat is snow leopard and wolf right?
15-04-2018T01:49:23,Twokinds,She's sorta based on a hyena
15-04-2018T01:49:29,Vatruvius,Not oddly strong feelings and probably would...be different for sure.
15-04-2018T01:49:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Well then
15-04-2018T01:49:54,Vatruvius,That makes sense...but hyena's are not in TK
15-04-2018T01:49:58,unsteddyphoenix,I knew that~
15-04-2018T01:50:51,unsteddyphoenix,"Well I doubt such a drastic change will happen with Colin, in this case you've narrowed down what you want."
15-04-2018T01:51:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Really light brown or just a pale brown?
15-04-2018T01:51:32,Vatruvius,Well...we know no complicated pattern...and we know just one color...so we only have the hue left.
15-04-2018T01:52:06,unsteddyphoenix,Its like...youve done 90% of it and are hung up on the 10
15-04-2018T01:52:11,unsteddyphoenix,Well thats how it seems
15-04-2018T01:52:26,unsteddyphoenix,And I definitely have been there if that's what it is.
15-04-2018T01:54:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Wheat color
15-04-2018T01:58:02,Twokinds,wheat might be nice
15-04-2018T01:58:04,Vatruvius,Well I am going to hope off and just watch Acq. Inc. Goodnight everyone! :ptv-greetings:
15-04-2018T01:58:11,MisterWho,"Errr timeout - what ""colin"" are we talking about atm. I only found the ""tourist""."
15-04-2018T02:00:08,DarthRexKing,I am going to bed. Goodnight everyone.
15-04-2018T02:00:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"Wheat could be very pretty, and fitted to his light personality. But it could make him look too bleached out"
15-04-2018T02:02:38,Vatruvius,Last statement before I leave...you have to be careful with how close Colin's color gets to Sam's hair color...unless she will not be a blonde.
15-04-2018T02:06:10,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh yeah, remember that script I wrote a while back Tom?"
15-04-2018T02:06:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Wheat is more brown than yellow (if mixed correctly)
15-04-2018T02:06:32,unsteddyphoenix,"Did the...""stage directions"" I guess, make sense?"
15-04-2018T02:06:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Though it can be considered a yellow or ‚Äúblond‚Äù shade
15-04-2018T02:06:42,unsteddyphoenix,"Like, the scene setup"
15-04-2018T02:07:21,SpazztasticKiwi,There is a ‚Äúwheat blond‚Äù color for hair dying and highlights
15-04-2018T02:07:30,SpazztasticKiwi,*blonde
15-04-2018T02:08:57,unsteddyphoenix,"""wheat"" would make sense considering his country background i guess?"

15-04-2018T02:27:51,Bgrmystr2,that's super expensive
15-04-2018T02:27:57,Twokinds,So the discount code is their way of trying to simplify things.
15-04-2018T02:28:44,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, if I'm gonna pay that much, I'd rather just go to the convention and buy it directly from you :u"
15-04-2018T02:28:52,unsteddyphoenix,No bundles? Any reason why?
15-04-2018T02:29:16,Twokinds,not sure
15-04-2018T02:29:57,unsteddyphoenix,Hm.
15-04-2018T02:30:10,unsteddyphoenix,The deal mustve been too good
15-04-2018T02:31:03,Bgrmystr2,The deal with the first 3 books and the artbook was what.. $100 or so?
15-04-2018T02:31:06,Bgrmystr2,for $150 value?
15-04-2018T02:31:15,Bgrmystr2,not including shipping of course
15-04-2018T02:31:18,Twokinds,I don't recall
15-04-2018T02:31:25,Bgrmystr2,"if you got the hardbacks, that is"
15-04-2018T02:31:39,Twokinds,I don't run the store so unfortunately I don't know what goes behind the decisions
15-04-2018T02:31:44,Bgrmystr2,"it was a crazy good discount, I just don't have the money to even get the digital ones :("
15-04-2018T02:31:53,Twokinds,Anyway I'm gunna hit the hay
15-04-2018T02:31:56,Twokinds,G'night
15-04-2018T02:32:01,Bgrmystr2,I can just read it online but it just aint the same
15-04-2018T02:32:05,Bgrmystr2,gnight tom :)
15-04-2018T02:32:16,unsteddyphoenix,gnight~
15-04-2018T02:33:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Night night
15-04-2018T02:33:32,Bgrmystr2,just looked it up on the wayback machine
15-04-2018T02:33:34,Bgrmystr2,and yes
15-04-2018T02:33:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Don‚Äôt let the hunger pains bite üòâ
15-04-2018T02:33:42,Bgrmystr2,it was a $150 value at $100
15-04-2018T02:35:19,unsteddyphoenix,basically a steal
15-04-2018T02:36:52,Bgrmystr2,"if you bought all 4 books together even with the 10% discount, you wouldn't get the artbook or the poster, and it totals $144"
15-04-2018T02:37:25,Bgrmystr2,which is a bit less than the $136 it would have cost if you got the combo
15-04-2018T02:37:45,Bgrmystr2,that's what I'm lookin at cuz I have the artbook and poster thanks to winning that contest qwe did
15-04-2018T02:38:18,Bgrmystr2,though other ppl will have to pay more if they want the artbook
15-04-2018T02:38:54,Bgrmystr2,$8 isn't too bad imo..
15-04-2018T02:39:04,Bgrmystr2,I could consider it a late fee
15-04-2018T02:39:22,unsteddyphoenix,heh
15-04-2018T02:39:31,unsteddyphoenix,Could be worse
15-04-2018T02:48:06,Dadrobit,"Ayyy, Tom. If you're still around, sorry I haven't been able to catch more of your streams lately."
15-04-2018T02:48:38,Dadrobit,"Between school finals and chasing the next paycheck, I've just been busier than a one legged man at an ass kicking competition."
15-04-2018T02:53:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Sounds as entertaining as one wrestler
15-04-2018T02:55:10,Bgrmystr2,lol tom went to sleep
15-04-2018T02:55:23,Bgrmystr2,may see it when he wakes up
15-04-2018T02:55:32,Bgrmystr2,or if he's still lurkin while in bed or whatever
15-04-2018T02:55:54,Dadrobit,"Yeah, saw he said he went to bed, was hoping he was lurking."
15-04-2018T02:56:08,Bgrmystr2,"well, it was over 20 mins ago now so"
15-04-2018T02:56:15,Bgrmystr2,dunno
15-04-2018T02:58:18,Twokinds,"No prob, Robit. I understand being busy."
15-04-2018T02:58:34,Bgrmystr2,ah there he is :v
15-04-2018T03:00:50,Dadrobit,Gotta get my work in so I can keep funding my vices.
15-04-2018T03:02:53,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs alive!
15-04-2018T03:03:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I need to go to bed too though
15-04-2018T03:06:30,Dadrobit,"Night, Spazz."
15-04-2018T03:06:42,Bgrmystr2,gnight kiwi
15-04-2018T03:10:17,unsteddyphoenix,"Youve been skipping streams, this will be going on your permanent record."
15-04-2018T03:12:33,Dadrobit,"Watch a stream, or pay next month's rent.... :thinking:"
15-04-2018T03:14:30,Dadrobit,"Oh, and I did finally figure out how to speak, so that was nice."
15-04-2018T03:15:01,Dadrobit,3 hours to record and edit 50 minutes of audio. GG.
15-04-2018T03:22:44,unsteddyphoenix,That sounds about normal?
15-04-2018T03:23:46,Dadrobit,"It's not terrible, after I took that first break, it started going smoothly."
15-04-2018T03:24:17,Dadrobit,I usually only take about 2x plus a bit of the actual run-time to complete a session.
15-04-2018T03:24:50,Dadrobit,Just that taking 3x+ on a long-form-ish narration feels bad.
15-04-2018T08:24:41,DRAGONTANOPUG,Good morning peoples!

15-04-2018T13:38:26,Twokinds,Remember to use 10KINDS or TENKINDS so you spent 10% less

15-04-2018T14:01:23,qwe304,you must eat fancy burritos
15-04-2018T14:01:37,Twokinds,"Well, that's about how much a burrito bowl costs."
15-04-2018T14:01:51,Twokinds,"Actually, more. At least at my local burrito places."
15-04-2018T14:02:11,qwe304,i pay 1.24 at taco bell
15-04-2018T14:03:32,Twokinds,Does taco bell have burrito bowls?
15-04-2018T14:03:44,Twokinds,My local taco bell shut down.
15-04-2018T14:03:46,Twokinds,:(
15-04-2018T14:03:58,qwe304,i think so... not sure
15-04-2018T14:04:10,qwe304,i live ~3/4 mile from a taco bell
15-04-2018T14:04:48,qwe304,"i think i took a pic of the menu, ill see if they do"
15-04-2018T14:05:15,ZombieKiller45,I live 1/4 to a taco bell
15-04-2018T14:08:52,TheBeckoner,My taco bell is a good place for free extra food. They always mess up orders
15-04-2018T14:10:15,qwe304,i wonder if my order was the first...
15-04-2018T14:10:36,MalinSharpPaw,"But, you know 5$ is not so small cash. at least it is almost entire dinner. or maybe two. (homemade i mean)"
15-04-2018T14:13:09,qwe304,most of my income is disposable so $5 is not a big loss
15-04-2018T14:14:28,qwe304,@twokinds maybe itrs time to unpin the book 3 preorder tweet
15-04-2018T14:17:02,Twokinds,I will lol

15-04-2018T14:17:43,qwe304,"a year and a half, its been pinned there"
15-04-2018T14:17:53,Twokinds,no one told me before now
15-04-2018T14:18:19,qwe304,lot of people are turned off by keenspots flat $40 international shipping it seems...
15-04-2018T14:19:54,Twokinds,Hm...
15-04-2018T14:20:29,Twokinds,"I mean, it is expensive to ship books internationally, but yeah, it's be nice if it was cheaper for Canada and Mexico."
15-04-2018T14:20:51,pretorian,"$69,99 shipping for me"
15-04-2018T14:20:57,pretorian,"*59,99"
15-04-2018T14:21:26,Twokinds,Seriously?

15-04-2018T14:22:40,qwe304,yeah ive seen 4 people already say they wont be getting it due to shipping cost
15-04-2018T14:22:54,pretorian,can't blame them
15-04-2018T14:24:47,Twokinds,Shipping prices have been going up like crazy in recent years
15-04-2018T14:24:48,qwe304,not much tom can do either..
15-04-2018T14:24:58,pretorian,yep
15-04-2018T14:25:26,Twokinds,"I remember back when I was doing the kickstarter, international rates for a flat rate envelope was... I think $23 dollars?"
15-04-2018T14:25:35,Twokinds,It's $35 or so now.
15-04-2018T14:26:35,Twokinds,That's just for an envelope. Don't even get started on boxes.
15-04-2018T14:26:36,Twokinds,Eugh
15-04-2018T14:27:10,pretorian,boxes = double the price?
15-04-2018T14:29:00,Twokinds,"Yeah, according to USPS, a medium flatrate box starts at $45."
15-04-2018T14:31:30,Twokinds,Where are you pretorian?

15-04-2018T14:52:21,BadFoMo,*What made you decide against it
15-04-2018T14:55:18,Twokinds,"I didn't decide against it, I just couldn't find someone to make it."
15-04-2018T14:55:33,BadFoMo,Oh.
15-04-2018T14:57:32,ThingsAreMoving,"When I buy stuff from the US, people usually send me stuff via DHL, might want to check if it isn't the cheapest option. I think it's eCommerce international packet, or something like that."
15-04-2018T14:57:48,Twokinds,DHL? Hm
15-04-2018T14:57:59,Twokinds,"Unfortunately, I have no say in the shipping process"
15-04-2018T14:58:07,Twokinds,Though I did send an email to Chris

15-04-2018T15:43:51,Twokinds,"They did respond to my email, but it seems like they best they're willing to offer atm"
15-04-2018T15:45:09,qwe304,"wonder how feasible it would be for people to buy it together, like 5 peoples items in one package"
15-04-2018T15:49:09,Foxpie,"shipping form usa is always expansive, even Australia is half the cost and there the other side of the word to me"
15-04-2018T15:49:47,Twokinds,The postal system is a mess thanks to homeland security.
15-04-2018T15:50:06,Twokinds,You should see the new customs forms I had to fill out the other day.
15-04-2018T15:50:47,Twokinds,Twice as big as the ones from just a few years ago.

15-04-2018T15:53:41,ThingsAreMoving,"Tbh if it's books or comics, then an ordinary x-ray should be more than enough"
15-04-2018T15:53:57,Twokinds,The problem is books don't show well on xrays
15-04-2018T15:54:07,Twokinds,Because they're a solid block.
15-04-2018T15:54:53,Foxpie,could be worse alot of items taxed on entry to the uk but books are not so i dont need to pay twice
15-04-2018T15:56:08,ThingsAreMoving,"add a tin foil card with ""I am a goddamn book"" pierced out"
15-04-2018T16:04:29,Vatruvius,Hmm...O imagine the shipping was more expensive for me than I thought because of the poster.

15-04-2018T17:16:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. I‚Äôm not your mom and I doubt I could change her mind if I tried
15-04-2018T17:17:10,MidnightBlue78,"Don't get it, or get it anyways and dont tell her"
15-04-2018T17:17:30,DRAGONTANOPUG,Im 13 she has the credit card
15-04-2018T17:17:37,MidnightBlue78,and this is advice coming from a qoman who has two kids

15-04-2018T17:18:12,MidnightBlue78,that must be tough
15-04-2018T17:18:49,DRAGONTANOPUG,I acn even become a supporter
15-04-2018T17:19:33,MidnightBlue78,Open a bank account and get your own card
15-04-2018T17:19:54,DRAGONTANOPUG,"@Twokinds will you be doing the same thing you are now, but in 5 years."
15-04-2018T17:19:54,SpazztasticKiwi,The site says 200 signed prints will be given out
15-04-2018T17:19:55,MidnightBlue78,and then you can buy it
15-04-2018T17:20:04,DRAGONTANOPUG,Its was 400!
15-04-2018T17:20:10,MidnightBlue78,200
15-04-2018T17:20:38,DRAGONTANOPUG,Last night tom said 400
15-04-2018T17:20:51,MidnightBlue78,the site says 200
15-04-2018T17:20:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"I thought there was gonna be 400, though by the time I get to order it, I might not get one"
15-04-2018T17:21:09,SpazztasticKiwi,So he overestimated. Oh well
15-04-2018T17:21:35,DRAGONTANOPUG,On a scale from 1 To 10 how mad am i taht my mum wont let me support twokinds.
15-04-2018T17:21:39,DRAGONTANOPUG,11
15-04-2018T17:21:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Pretty sure I‚Äôll live
15-04-2018T17:22:12,Bgrmystr2,He didn't overestimate
15-04-2018T17:22:14,Bgrmystr2,you underestimate.
15-04-2018T17:22:30,Bgrmystr2,the site probably already updated after 200 were already bought out
15-04-2018T17:22:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. And ranting here isn‚Äôt gonna help
15-04-2018T17:22:45,DRAGONTANOPUG,Im moving out as soon as i can.
15-04-2018T17:22:54,MidnightBlue78,congrats!
15-04-2018T17:22:57,Bgrmystr2,"and if anything, it's written so that way noone can buy more than 200 copies in one transaction"
15-04-2018T17:23:11,Bgrmystr2,"rofl 13 years old and moving out, yeh, I'll wait for that."
15-04-2018T17:23:18,DRAGONTANOPUG,5 years
15-04-2018T17:23:39,Bgrmystr2,"depending on state, 3 years, but good luck managing it"
15-04-2018T17:24:16,DRAGONTANOPUG,Ill just move in with a friend
15-04-2018T17:24:17,MidnightBlue78,If only i were 13 again
15-04-2018T17:24:21,DRAGONTANOPUG,Or college
15-04-2018T17:24:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I shutter to think of me at 13 again
15-04-2018T17:24:41,warhawk,"I believe its 200 prints are available with the manga size, and 200 with the premium size"
15-04-2018T17:24:44,MidnightBlue78,looks like you've got ot all figured out
15-04-2018T17:24:52,warhawk,so 400 total split between the two sizes
15-04-2018T17:24:54,Bgrmystr2,"could be, warhawk"
15-04-2018T17:25:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder when the shirts ship
15-04-2018T17:25:08,DRAGONTANOPUG,Not quite still money..... rent and for twokinds
15-04-2018T17:25:15,MidnightBlue78,Summer i think
15-04-2018T17:25:22,DRAGONTANOPUG,Or by this time his new comic.
15-04-2018T17:25:25,Bgrmystr2,"shirts aren't preordered, Midnight"
15-04-2018T17:25:28,Bgrmystr2,the book is

15-04-2018T17:26:17,Bgrmystr2,ah yeah they are
15-04-2018T17:26:18,Bgrmystr2,weird
15-04-2018T17:26:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I guess the point is you get them eventually
15-04-2018T17:26:30,Bgrmystr2,why would you have clothing set to pre-order?
15-04-2018T17:26:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"long wait, but worth"
15-04-2018T17:26:40,Bgrmystr2,it's not like it takes that long to make them
15-04-2018T17:26:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Probably to cut production cost
15-04-2018T17:26:50,DRAGONTANOPUG,Maybe i can support 1 month
15-04-2018T17:26:52,Bgrmystr2,"a book is understandable, clothing, not so much"
15-04-2018T17:26:57,MidnightBlue78,just to build up the excitememnt
15-04-2018T17:27:03,Bgrmystr2,eh :u

15-04-2018T17:30:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yep

15-04-2018T17:34:36,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Tbh i thinks its the furrys, its them to blame for my liking of this comic."

15-04-2018T17:36:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah Atlanta
15-04-2018T17:36:59,Bgrmystr2,"I think tk is good for you, but you are being bad for you."
15-04-2018T17:37:13,DRAGONTANOPUG,im staying up all night for streams
15-04-2018T17:37:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Dunno if I want to go just one day or actually invest to go all 4
15-04-2018T17:37:22,MidnightBlue78,"yeah, don't use tk as an excuse for bad behavior"
15-04-2018T17:37:31,DRAGONTANOPUG,What does tk help me with Bgr
15-04-2018T17:37:51,MidnightBlue78,Do you live in Georgia?
15-04-2018T17:38:09,DRAGONTANOPUG,"No im making poor life choicea because of my obsession for tk, ID"
15-04-2018T17:38:18,MidnightBlue78,"I live in Georgia, but still can't attend :("
15-04-2018T17:38:48,Bgrmystr2,"and that's you, dragon. not tk"
15-04-2018T17:38:59,DRAGONTANOPUG,Not blaming tk
15-04-2018T17:39:05,Bgrmystr2,you did earlier
15-04-2018T17:39:10,DRAGONTANOPUG,Blaming furrys
15-04-2018T17:39:14,DRAGONTANOPUG,Lol
15-04-2018T17:39:21,DRAGONTANOPUG,No my obssesion
15-04-2018T17:39:36,Bgrmystr2,then stop obsessing over it :v
15-04-2018T17:39:39,Bgrmystr2,ez
15-04-2018T17:39:44,ThingsAreMoving,On one hand I'm curious about what he's saying... but then I like my chat bullshit free.
15-04-2018T17:39:50,ThingsAreMoving,"decisions, decisions"
15-04-2018T17:39:57,DRAGONTANOPUG,Easier said than done
15-04-2018T17:40:08,Bgrmystr2,it is easier said than done yes.
15-04-2018T17:40:32,Bgrmystr2,prolly don't worry about it things. :P
15-04-2018T17:40:39,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Ill stop, Things"
15-04-2018T17:40:46,Bgrmystr2,he can't read your messages anyway
15-04-2018T17:40:54,Bgrmystr2,so it's pointless :p
15-04-2018T17:41:44,ThingsAreMoving,That's good. I'm just wondering if there is some entertainment value in his rants
15-04-2018T17:42:27,Bgrmystr2,uhhh.. :thinking: I would say so
15-04-2018T17:42:43,Bgrmystr2,but the tradeoff is your chat filling with everything else
15-04-2018T17:42:48,Bgrmystr2,that isn't entertaining
15-04-2018T17:42:54,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Well first things firat ill start by deleteing all tk photos, uninstall discord, shange any profile pics, but keep the comic dowmloaded in one drive."
15-04-2018T17:43:03,Bgrmystr2,"weigh the odds, Things"
15-04-2018T17:43:35,Bgrmystr2,"that's probably not for the best, dragon, you'll only create a black market for yourself"
15-04-2018T17:43:41,ThingsAreMoving,I'll pass for the meantime. You guys provide enough entertainment anyway.
15-04-2018T17:43:46,DRAGONTANOPUG,Oh and unbook mark everything from my browser
15-04-2018T17:43:56,ThingsAreMoving,&lt;3

15-04-2018T17:46:35,SpazztasticKiwi,May 24-27
15-04-2018T17:46:46,DRAGONTANOPUG,Also in 4 years im burning the art book
15-04-2018T17:47:01,MidnightBlue78,"Girl, you should go"
15-04-2018T17:47:25,MidnightBlue78,"I mean, if i were able to do what i wanted, i would be there in a heartbeat"
15-04-2018T17:47:56,MidnightBlue78,"Dragon, you cant burn the book"
15-04-2018T17:48:05,MidnightBlue78,You'll be cursed forever
15-04-2018T17:50:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Bruh if you don‚Äôt want it anymore I‚Äôll take it
15-04-2018T17:50:57,MidnightBlue78,why would you burn the book anyways?
15-04-2018T17:52:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôve got to leave soon, but I‚Äôll be on later about 9"
15-04-2018T17:54:26,DRAGONTANOPUG,I figured im obsesd with tk so i think it will help
15-04-2018T18:06:22,DRAGONTANOPUG,Did my profile pic change.
15-04-2018T18:06:25,DRAGONTANOPUG,?
15-04-2018T18:06:39,BluePhantom90,couldn't fully tell you
15-04-2018T18:07:03,DRAGONTANOPUG,What do you mean
15-04-2018T18:07:30,BluePhantom90,it could have changed but I don't know. I wasn't here when you changed it
15-04-2018T18:07:38,DRAGONTANOPUG,What is it then?
15-04-2018T18:07:42,BluePhantom90,I mean before you changed it
15-04-2018T18:08:09,BluePhantom90,Some sort of armored thing?
15-04-2018T18:08:17,DRAGONTANOPUG,Ok good it change

15-04-2018T18:09:35,ThingsAreMoving,"Alright, I'm off. Have a good monday, everyone. :ctwokinds-nibsbounce:"
15-04-2018T18:09:43,DRAGONTANOPUG,Bye things
15-04-2018T18:10:16,DRAGONTANOPUG,Have good one
15-04-2018T18:11:39,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Bgr, anything else could i do to help the obsesion"
15-04-2018T18:13:51,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: Like I said, removing all traces of it will only create a black market for you. Kind of like when people say ""this is bad"" but don't explain why.. and then others want to figure out why, so by saying it's bad, it naturally creates a demand"
15-04-2018T18:14:40,Bgrmystr2,you'll only end up making more of a problem in the future by removing it
15-04-2018T18:14:55,Bgrmystr2,everything in moderation.
15-04-2018T18:15:50,Twokinds,o rly

15-04-2018T18:17:20,Bgrmystr2,I've already chosen this path
15-04-2018T18:17:36,Twokinds,"Man... filing taxes, and ouch, ouch does it hurt"

15-04-2018T18:21:24,Vatruvius,I just did my taxes yesterday...got $19 back though I only had a job for a month so...not all that much.

15-04-2018T18:28:23,BluePhantom90,"did like the ""Flora being told her butt did look big"" And Flora was totally cool with it. Should do a alternative one"
15-04-2018T18:29:19,Twokinds,Of course. Flora likes to be told any part of her is big.
15-04-2018T18:29:21,Twokinds,Except her head.
15-04-2018T18:30:04,DRAGONTANOPUG,Lol
15-04-2018T18:30:08,Twokinds,Phew. Taxes filed and paid for.

15-04-2018T18:33:04,DRAGONTANOPUG,Sorry what i meant she doesnt like to be called big in general.
15-04-2018T18:33:49,BluePhantom90,"if you don't watch Netflix I would have ruined it for you all. But yeah guys name ""Keith"" meets his Mom. which was kinda funny"

15-04-2018T18:35:46,DRAGONTANOPUG,?
15-04-2018T18:35:55,BluePhantom90,"yeah, I mean they still keep the blood and gore out. BUT it is dark"
15-04-2018T18:36:30,BluePhantom90,"with a lot of Humor. It was done by those that did ""Avatar the last air bender"""
15-04-2018T18:36:47,DRAGONTANOPUG,That was good show
15-04-2018T18:38:10,BluePhantom90,"it was, and they did ""Legend Of Kora"" was really dark too. So they applied the same Dark feel to it on Voltron with some good humor episodes"
15-04-2018T18:38:51,DRAGONTANOPUG,Dont know why but im watching tinker bell with meh sister.
15-04-2018T18:40:02,BluePhantom90,nothing wrong with that. I watched My little Pony's with my Step Niece.
15-04-2018T18:40:38,DRAGONTANOPUG,"That was huge one with my sister 2 years ago, i watch every season."
15-04-2018T18:41:02,Vatruvius,Thst is because I only made $300 Tom...you make more than than double that in a month! :D
15-04-2018T18:41:06,BluePhantom90,about the same. I kinda watch bits of it here and there
15-04-2018T18:43:43,Vatruvius,lol...went to double check and you make way more than double. :P Mixed up the number of patreons with what you get every month. I started to do the calculations and it sounded really off...
15-04-2018T18:45:12,DRAGONTANOPUG,I want those 3 months back XD
15-04-2018T18:45:23,BluePhantom90,lol

15-04-2018T18:46:22,DRAGONTANOPUG,I would
15-04-2018T18:46:50,DRAGONTANOPUG,3 months is enough time get money for college
15-04-2018T18:47:02,DRAGONTANOPUG,For me.
15-04-2018T18:47:34,BluePhantom90,huh Scotland's National animal is a Unicorn... wow
15-04-2018T18:49:40,Vatruvius,3 months does not get you enough to pay for a semester at college...you would still be paying out of pocket unless you got a really nice job at which point...why are you going to college if you can completely pay for it.
15-04-2018T18:51:44,BluePhantom90,"hell tom you could challenge the IRS and say ""There is no law stating I have to pay taxes"""
15-04-2018T18:51:58,Twokinds,"Oh yeah, that'd go over well lol"
15-04-2018T18:52:16,BluePhantom90,well yeah a guy did tat and won all those cases
15-04-2018T18:52:31,Vatruvius,No way.
15-04-2018T18:52:35,BluePhantom90,hold on
15-04-2018T18:53:10,Twokinds,"Well it's too late, they already got it"

15-04-2018T18:55:18,Vatruvius,Umm...live?
15-04-2018T18:56:16,DRAGONTANOPUG,Ok..... life choice wise
15-04-2018T18:57:04,Twokinds,"Read up on compound interest and invest in yourself early, while you have the advantage of time."
15-04-2018T18:57:11,Twokinds,Your future self with thank you.
15-04-2018T18:58:15,DRAGONTANOPUG,Perfect advice imma go do somthjng with my life instead of play video games.
15-04-2018T18:58:33,DRAGONTANOPUG,First spelling for school
15-04-2018T18:59:22,BluePhantom90,"the guy here ""Bill Conklin"" offers $300,000 if you can prove by law you have to pay Taxes, which he won all court cases by the IRS to make him pay"
15-04-2018T19:03:14,Twokinds,"Well, he's a braver man than I am."
15-04-2018T19:03:21,BluePhantom90,lol
15-04-2018T19:03:43,Vatruvius,He has a law degree or a lot of practice in law...yes?
15-04-2018T19:05:01,BluePhantom90,"I think so. I mean when in Court he demanded the IRS to point to the law he had to pay taxes... Best part they couldn't find it, Just proves when the system is too big you could forget the most simplest things"
15-04-2018T19:05:10,Bgrmystr2,yeah there's always a reason people win all those cases.
15-04-2018T19:05:35,Twokinds,Well originally people didn't pay federal taxes
15-04-2018T19:05:44,BluePhantom90,yeah
15-04-2018T19:05:49,Twokinds,"It started like a lot of things, as a temp measure for war, if I recall"
15-04-2018T19:06:03,Twokinds,"And then they just kept it because, hey, they're getting paid."
15-04-2018T19:06:09,Vatruvius,It was a state yhing right...andd the state pitched into supporting the federal government.
15-04-2018T19:06:38,Twokinds,Money money money
15-04-2018T19:06:59,BluePhantom90,well makes scene. e-e Like all Governments. When they get money they try to keep as much or take more money from the people
15-04-2018T19:09:19,BluePhantom90,I remember a state did a Tax on Alcohol after a flood destroyed a town. Well it was suppose to last 5 years around in the 1900's. Its still in place today
15-04-2018T19:12:51,BluePhantom90,"BTW tom you should look up a Cartoon called ""Final Space"" for laughs"
15-04-2018T19:20:49,BluePhantom90,or this short cartoon. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvXtRVifAXE
15-04-2018T19:26:48,DRAGONTANOPUG,The fucking unicorn is the best!
15-04-2018T19:27:08,BluePhantom90,lol
15-04-2018T19:27:18,BluePhantom90,its a laugh.
15-04-2018T19:36:44,DRAGONTANOPUG,"TOM, i know i i have already asked this but i really want a hoodie, but ill have to wait. They are limited so is it untill their out of stock? If they do run out of hoodies and shirts, are you also looking at hats?"
15-04-2018T19:38:07,Twokinds,I don't think they're going to run out.
15-04-2018T19:39:10,DRAGONTANOPUG,Oh
15-04-2018T19:39:30,DRAGONTANOPUG,"So its like the books, they will always be there?"
15-04-2018T19:39:52,TomFurson,"Quick question, if you are still here. What size of canvas do you use for sketching streams?"
15-04-2018T19:40:09,Dadrobit,"Oh, book is up for pre-order?"
15-04-2018T19:40:18,Dadrobit,Decisions decisions...
15-04-2018T19:41:21,Vatruvius,Hmm...I asume the signiture prints just have your signiture on them...you are not adressing with the orderer's name?
15-04-2018T19:42:17,Dadrobit,Also black TK gear?
15-04-2018T19:42:49,Dadrobit,:/ Maybe if I didn't live in a state with triple didget weather half the year I'd go out in something black.
15-04-2018T19:43:08,Dadrobit,Maybe like a TK hat or something.
15-04-2018T19:43:15,Twokinds,......
15-04-2018T19:43:33,Twokinds,"Maybe I should rethink my ""nobody wears hats anymore"" opinion"
15-04-2018T19:43:51,Vatruvius,Lol
15-04-2018T19:44:08,Dadrobit,Lol
15-04-2018T19:45:16,DRAGONTANOPUG,LMAO
15-04-2018T19:45:41,Dadrobit,The sun sucks yo. Hats are great for less suckage.
15-04-2018T19:45:49,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Hats, im sure my mom can live with."
15-04-2018T19:46:09,Bgrmystr2,xDD tom
15-04-2018T19:46:10,Dadrobit,I'd buy one with a Templar insignia.
15-04-2018T19:46:15,DRAGONTANOPUG,Me too
15-04-2018T19:46:33,DRAGONTANOPUG,Or traces templar shirt
15-04-2018T19:46:35,Dadrobit,Or maybe even the basitin insignia
15-04-2018T19:47:41,DRAGONTANOPUG,Justa black hat with the paw is fine with me.
15-04-2018T19:49:15,Ordithus,Ooh I like robit's ideas.  If I wore hats.
15-04-2018T19:49:52,DRAGONTANOPUG,Great you support tom thinking people dont wear hats.
15-04-2018T19:50:41,Twokinds,"They told me the logo wouldn't work for a cap, for some reason"
15-04-2018T19:50:52,DRAGONTANOPUG,On hats?
15-04-2018T19:50:59,DRAGONTANOPUG,Oh caps
15-04-2018T19:51:00,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
15-04-2018T19:51:05,DRAGONTANOPUG,Thot he said crap
15-04-2018T19:51:11,Dadrobit,"Just orderd the hardback + print, so that'll have to do until I can get a hat :)"
15-04-2018T19:51:16,Bgrmystr2,reading is hard lol :v
15-04-2018T19:51:49,unsteddyphoenix,i bet it'd work on a fedora...
15-04-2018T19:51:54,Ordithus,"Nice, robit!"
15-04-2018T19:52:36,Ordithus,I too ordered the Maximum option
15-04-2018T19:52:52,Dadrobit,"Never did the fedora, that was my little brother's gig."
15-04-2018T19:52:54,Bgrmystr2,must be nice to be blessed with a sexy voice you can use to make money :v
15-04-2018T19:53:09,DRAGONTANOPUG,Well crap..... no hats........ sad Dragon.=(
15-04-2018T19:53:14,Dadrobit,Mmmmmmm
15-04-2018T19:53:27,Dadrobit,Sucks when I don't get work though.
15-04-2018T19:53:45,unsteddyphoenix,yes I was joking dont wear a fedora
15-04-2018T19:53:50,Bgrmystr2,yeah but you don't really need to worry about training or whatever
15-04-2018T19:53:54,Bgrmystr2,your voice came with you
15-04-2018T19:53:58,Bgrmystr2,it just happened
15-04-2018T19:54:06,Dadrobit,"Last night was nice, made almost a grand off of that job, but those are too far inbetween to be comfortable."
15-04-2018T19:54:07,Bgrmystr2,super lucky
15-04-2018T19:54:16,DRAGONTANOPUG,Im still ranting...
15-04-2018T19:54:22,DRAGONTANOPUG,XD
15-04-2018T19:54:25,qwe304,@twokinds what about the logo without the text?
15-04-2018T19:54:34,DRAGONTANOPUG,I need to chill
15-04-2018T19:54:36,Dadrobit,"Also, excuse me, but training is very important."
15-04-2018T19:55:11,Dadrobit,Gotta keep these pipes in optimal shape if I want to last.
15-04-2018T19:55:48,Bgrmystr2,it won't make your voice un-sexy. I've heard your default voice when you speak. It's naturally good
15-04-2018T19:55:55,Dadrobit,Taking acting classes and coaching still costs time and money
15-04-2018T19:56:12,Bgrmystr2,but all the impersonations and other shit I can see
15-04-2018T19:56:29,DRAGONTANOPUG,We need mics in this chat
15-04-2018T19:56:48,Bgrmystr2,god no
15-04-2018T19:56:51,Bgrmystr2,not in this one
15-04-2018T19:57:05,DRAGONTANOPUG,Toche
15-04-2018T19:57:20,Bgrmystr2,you don't want to be in a voice chat with 120+ other people at the same time
15-04-2018T19:57:30,Dadrobit,"Even just talking ""naturally"" can. Having to emote for long form narration for hours on end even just speaking as a narrator will kill you if you don't know your limits."
15-04-2018T19:57:35,DRAGONTANOPUG,Most of then dont even speak
15-04-2018T19:57:52,Bgrmystr2,text chat is fine
15-04-2018T19:58:17,Dadrobit,Figured that out the hard way when I was just starting out.
15-04-2018T19:58:22,Bgrmystr2,"yeh dadro, but at least you've got the voice for it"
15-04-2018T19:58:35,Dadrobit,And I intend to keep it as long as possible :D
15-04-2018T19:58:51,DRAGONTANOPUG,Its ao hard to type tho.
15-04-2018T19:58:51,Bgrmystr2,"I will never have a deep voice no matter what I do, so things like what you do are impossible for me"
15-04-2018T19:59:04,Bgrmystr2,without any kind of voice box altering or whatnot
15-04-2018T19:59:11,DRAGONTANOPUG,I already have a deep voice
15-04-2018T19:59:41,Bgrmystr2,but you can go at it from the get-go
15-04-2018T20:01:30,Dadrobit,"Deep voices aren't the be all end all though. Unless your name is Don La Fontaine or James Earl Jones, or Morgan Freeman, people want the ""everyman"" voice for their work. The guy who sounds like he could be your neighbor."
15-04-2018T20:01:47,qwe304,i can pull of either
15-04-2018T20:01:48,Bgrmystr2,you have that kinda voice though
15-04-2018T20:02:05,Dadrobit,"For advertising and presentation at least, which is a majority of the profession."
15-04-2018T20:02:44,Bgrmystr2,I don't have any of that. :/
15-04-2018T20:02:56,Bgrmystr2,never will
15-04-2018T20:03:27,Dadrobit,":/ There's a spot here for everyone. Somebosdy's looking for a voice that sounds just like yours, you just don't know it!"
15-04-2018T20:03:35,Dadrobit,Somebody's*
15-04-2018T20:03:38,Bgrmystr2,yeh ok :v
15-04-2018T20:06:25,Dadrobit,"To get in, all you need are some packing blankets, a closet, a couple hundred $ for a decent mic, and the capacity to be told ""No"" multiple times every day for the rest of your life and still not quit!"
15-04-2018T20:06:27,Dadrobit,:)
15-04-2018T20:07:00,Bgrmystr2,xD
15-04-2018T20:07:50,Bgrmystr2,I will find what I am good at one day. :thinking:
15-04-2018T20:08:24,Dadrobit,Perhaps it will find you :thinking:
15-04-2018T20:08:36,Bgrmystr2,ha. I'll keep waitin :v
15-04-2018T20:12:14,DRAGONTANOPUG,"This was with my friend 3 months ago, just for to get an idea of what i sound like. https://youtu.be/WPQPtVO-2FA.      Dont watch anyother vids please thanks."
15-04-2018T20:25:08,DRAGONTANOPUG,Lol i went the 14 years on the net website. Almost every banner was the preorders are out.
15-04-2018T20:28:51,Twokinds,"You know, just in case you miss it the first time"
15-04-2018T20:29:10,Dadrobit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1PN3qnVW6s&feature=youtu.be
15-04-2018T20:29:39,Dadrobit,Here ya go. Provided the voice for another student's project and helped him with some of the general mix.
15-04-2018T20:30:03,Dadrobit,Still has another 2 or so weeks to clean it up.
15-04-2018T20:34:07,Dadrobit,"Wasn't 100% on the delivery of some of it, but he was happy with it, and if the client's happy, I'm happy."
15-04-2018T20:35:49,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
15-04-2018T20:37:46,DRAGONTANOPUG,Its still looks amazing robit
15-04-2018T20:38:45,Dadrobit,"Lol, not really my project though, mine's got a lot more yelling and shouting incoherently."
15-04-2018T20:38:49,Dadrobit,But ty
15-04-2018T20:39:21,Ordithus,That's the sort of thing you work on?  Neat.
15-04-2018T20:40:08,DRAGONTANOPUG,https://youtu.be/BzMn82G1dic   i made this ww2 recreation
15-04-2018T20:42:29,Dadrobit,"In class yeah. Actual ""work"" is a whole lot more, ""Try Events and Adventures today! We're ~not~ a dating site! We're just an organizer of events for local singles like yourself!"""
15-04-2018T20:43:12,Ordithus,That sounded very annoying in my head.
15-04-2018T20:43:15,Vatruvius,So you provided the voice in that work?
15-04-2018T20:43:57,DRAGONTANOPUG,Please watch the this video i worked hard for my History grade. https://youtu.be/BzMn82G1dic
15-04-2018T20:44:11,Dadrobit,"Yeah, Vat. And I hope I try not to sound too annoying, Ord, lol."
15-04-2018T20:44:39,Ordithus,"I don't know how you sounded in it, lol.  But what was in my head... that sort of ad is always the worst."
15-04-2018T20:45:41,Vatruvius,So is the point of your class to try and replicate and enhance game trailers?
15-04-2018T20:46:22,DRAGONTANOPUG,Recreate ww2 in a video format.
15-04-2018T20:46:25,DRAGONTANOPUG,So yes
15-04-2018T20:47:28,Vatruvius,And you Dadro?
15-04-2018T20:47:57,Dadrobit,"Dragon, reminds me of what myself and a few other kids in high school did for an English project. We were supposed to recreate a scene from a book, and Red Vs Blue had just become a thing, so we basically just copied RvB and used dialogue from the book."
15-04-2018T20:48:11,DRAGONTANOPUG,Lol
15-04-2018T20:49:14,Vatruvius,RvB was awsome!
15-04-2018T20:49:55,Dadrobit,We focus on complete audio replacement in video. Starting out in simple stuff like a 15 second avalanche video and an F1 car passing by on a track. To the final program class where we spend the entire semester on a single video of our choice.
15-04-2018T20:50:24,DRAGONTANOPUG,Dang
15-04-2018T20:50:26,Dadrobit,But all of them start out as completely mute videos for us to work with.
15-04-2018T20:50:54,Dadrobit,"Video game trailers are just very convenient, but others do things like snippets form movies."
15-04-2018T20:51:10,Dadrobit,Last semester someone took a few minutes out of Howl's Moving Castle.
15-04-2018T20:51:19,Vatruvius,But like that Blizzard trailer...it was close to the original right? That is the point?
15-04-2018T20:51:19,Dadrobit,It just depends on the student.
15-04-2018T20:51:24,DRAGONTANOPUG,Thats what we do in filmmaking
15-04-2018T20:52:16,Dadrobit,"It's up to student discretion. Some take it super serious, some take it in oddball directions, some just try to put a bit of a spin on it."
15-04-2018T20:52:32,DRAGONTANOPUG,We do stuff like Napoleon Dynamite Central Intelligence Big Bang Theory and some stuff from Studio C
15-04-2018T20:52:46,Dadrobit,The point is to make it the best that you can that demonstrates your abilities.
15-04-2018T20:53:19,Dadrobit,So that you can take what you make and start a reel you can show to agencies so that you can get jobs.
15-04-2018T20:53:50,Vatruvius,I see...that is pretty neat. *neat Keith here*
15-04-2018T20:55:35,DRAGONTANOPUG,Lol
15-04-2018T20:56:11,Dadrobit,"For me, I don't necessarily see myself working as a dedicated engineer to a studio, but I figure I can use what I learn to offer services where I can when I feel I'm proficient enough that I can charge for that kind of work."
15-04-2018T20:57:29,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Tom, Do you think that tk could potentially become a anime?"
15-04-2018T20:57:50,Bgrmystr2,"you're only the 9,001st person to ask that question."
15-04-2018T20:57:57,DRAGONTANOPUG,Wow
15-04-2018T20:58:38,DRAGONTANOPUG,Looks Whos counting! XD
15-04-2018T21:00:31,Vatruvius,I even asked...but I went full on animation like Zootopia. Never did get an answer...though I like the comic as is. When you get to movies and stuff things change...like watching a movie based on a book you read...kinda disappointing.
15-04-2018T21:02:05,DRAGONTANOPUG,I could start animating
15-04-2018T21:02:15,DRAGONTANOPUG,Slowly work on twokimds
15-04-2018T21:02:18,DRAGONTANOPUG,Tk
15-04-2018T21:03:42,Vatruvius,Perhaps...but then you need to get voices. Picking the right one could get finicky too...might be better just to leave as is.
15-04-2018T21:06:01,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Yea your right, voices"
15-04-2018T21:06:12,DRAGONTANOPUG,Nvm scratch animating
15-04-2018T21:08:40,Vatruvius,You could animate the emojis and stuff that come on chat. Does not mean you have to give up animating.
15-04-2018T21:10:09,DRAGONTANOPUG,No its fine.
15-04-2018T21:14:44,DRAGONTANOPUG,Im going go see how fast i can read every comic bye!
15-04-2018T21:14:56,DRAGONTANOPUG,Every tk comic.
15-04-2018T21:16:03,Vatruvius,You mean every page in the TK comic.
15-04-2018T21:16:09,DRAGONTANOPUG,Sure
15-04-2018T21:21:14,qwe304,i did it in 5 hr on my first read
15-04-2018T21:22:19,Vatruvius,Took me 7 1/2 - 9 hrs. And I am a slow reader. But I binged it...completed it in less than 24 hours.
15-04-2018T21:24:25,Vatruvius,"I am excited, playing Cold Waters again!"
15-04-2018T21:29:32,NightMeaty22,kinda wants to move away from home
15-04-2018T21:41:40,SpazztasticKiwi,What kind of universe do I live in where my cat just randomly boops me
15-04-2018T21:42:10,DRAGONTANOPUG,A furry one.
15-04-2018T21:42:24,Bgrmystr2,same one the rest of us live in?
15-04-2018T21:42:30,Bgrmystr2,sounds normal to me
15-04-2018T21:42:56,Bgrmystr2,what kinda cat wouldn't boop it's human?
15-04-2018T21:43:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"Cats are generally seen as affluent, rather unsocial animals. Mine will pester you until you pet him no matter what‚Äôs going on"
15-04-2018T21:48:21,Ordithus,Sounds like most cats I know
15-04-2018T21:55:05,MisterWho,*hovering over the TwoKinds Vol.4 buy button* 49$ shipping WOOOUCH!
15-04-2018T21:58:26,Vatruvius,Hahaha...you could get another premium book and signed print with that.

15-04-2018T22:04:06,Vatruvius,Hmm...I ordered before noticing the 10% off code...not much to save though really. I hot the print...all that matters.
15-04-2018T22:04:23,Vatruvius,got*
15-04-2018T22:06:07,Bgrmystr2,you can pull up one of them on the support page
15-04-2018T22:06:17,Bgrmystr2,and tell them you forgot the code or w/e
15-04-2018T22:06:30,Bgrmystr2,"how you managed to do that, I dunno"
15-04-2018T22:07:22,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Alright, picarto reset the severs so i can see my profile pic. Happy boi"
15-04-2018T22:07:39,DRAGONTANOPUG,Looks fuckin badass
15-04-2018T22:08:03,DRAGONTANOPUG,Lol you can whisper to yoirse
15-04-2018T22:08:08,DRAGONTANOPUG,Yourself
15-04-2018T22:09:33,MisterWho,The problem is the already done payment for your order. The hassle to cancel that one won't be worth the -4$ :/
15-04-2018T22:10:01,MisterWho,"So, Apollo is on the way...with 75‚Ç¨ payload. XD"
15-04-2018T22:10:09,Vatruvius,I got the notification about Vol. 4 through one of the Discord chats...I immediately ordered then the Discord chat notified me about the 10% off 20 minutes later...but I really do not mind. I got the book and print so I am happy.

15-04-2018T22:59:26,NightMeaty22,I'd take it back if i could but... you see it is in his safe
15-04-2018T22:59:27,BluePhantom90,"its why its a bitch to move out of New York. You would have to pay two state Taxes, and continue to pay them for a few years."
15-04-2018T22:59:42,NightMeaty22,Damn
15-04-2018T23:01:21,BluePhantom90,"I think its New Jersey, New York, and I think California joined that list"
15-04-2018T23:01:53,Bgrmystr2,"once you stop living in New York, you don't pay taxes for living in New York anymore."

15-04-2018T23:06:12,Bgrmystr2,"not living in that state, not paying the taxes. They don't get to charge you for somethin you're not doing."
15-04-2018T23:06:35,Bgrmystr2,"in the middle of moving, sure, but not afterwards."
15-04-2018T23:06:51,BluePhantom90,"hmm well there is the part time living New york Tax so yes, You have to pay Taxes to two states when you move"
15-04-2018T23:07:12,Bgrmystr2,me and them would have words then

15-04-2018T23:15:43,Twokinds,Just a random extra on set.
15-04-2018T23:15:59,SpazztasticKiwi,For a minute there I couldn‚Äôt place who that guy character was
15-04-2018T23:16:02,BluePhantom90,but had what like 3-5 sketches with her and Danels in like a month or two

15-04-2018T23:17:22,Bgrmystr2,"not true, Kiwi. you can ALWAYS mismatch ships"
15-04-2018T23:17:39,Bgrmystr2,side characters need not apply. Everyone's invited.

15-04-2018T23:21:07,Vatruvius,But...how is that profitable?

15-04-2018T23:23:09,Bgrmystr2,cept magic.

15-04-2018T23:41:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"I can square and line dance ok, but it‚Äôs been awhile"
15-04-2018T23:44:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also if you want to know how uneducated some people are on sex ed, I had a guy that had no idea birth control did anything but prevent pregnancy"
15-04-2018T23:51:47,Vatruvius,I know birth control tricks the body hormonally which prevents the embro from nesting into the uturian wall...but other than that I know nothing. My sex ed never went into ways females can prevent a pregnancy...just how males could.
15-04-2018T23:57:58,SpazztasticKiwi,The hormones are the thing to focus on - they help keep such levels normal to fix problems ranging from anemia to ovarian cysts
15-04-2018T23:58:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"But on a side note, I just saw another Incredibles 2 trailer"
