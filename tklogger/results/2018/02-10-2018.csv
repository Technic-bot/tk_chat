02-10-2018T00:53:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Gotta keep the main event within happy standards

02-10-2018T00:54:32,Twokinds,i tired
02-10-2018T00:54:52,SpazztasticKiwi,But not hungry right
02-10-2018T00:54:58,unsteddyphoenix,How was the trip back
02-10-2018T00:55:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Blink twice if your family is currently trying to cook you after all that time stuffing you
02-10-2018T00:57:42,unsteddyphoenix,The long con
02-10-2018T00:58:11,Dadrobit,long range cooking techniques at work here. I must observe!
02-10-2018T01:00:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Dear God they ate him already
02-10-2018T01:01:05,SpazztasticKiwi,The candy wasn’t enough
02-10-2018T01:02:33,unsteddyphoenix,oh yeah I saw that
02-10-2018T01:02:52,unsteddyphoenix,"Be honest, did the chocolate jelly candy actually taste good or were you messing with him"
02-10-2018T01:03:32,Bgrmystr2,"heya tom, welcome back :)"
02-10-2018T01:03:45,Bgrmystr2,haha phoenix asking the real questions
02-10-2018T01:07:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Gotta ask the good questions. But may be more inclined to just go on to bed
02-10-2018T01:07:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I would
02-10-2018T01:08:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"That is a point though - how was, and is, the time zone adapting"
02-10-2018T01:08:48,Dadrobit,Gotta stay up. Got me some nerd shit to do tonight.
02-10-2018T01:11:00,Twokinds,I thought it was all pretty good
02-10-2018T01:11:18,Twokinds,But I can tolerate a lot of stuff
02-10-2018T01:11:24,Bgrmystr2,well then
02-10-2018T01:11:30,Bgrmystr2,that answers that question
02-10-2018T01:11:41,Bgrmystr2,"btw tom you have a great ""Goddamnit mark"" face"
02-10-2018T01:12:49,Dadrobit,"Big same on food tolerance. I love trying new dishes, it's actually the best."
02-10-2018T01:13:09,unsteddyphoenix,"So can I, but doesnt mean I ENJOY most things."
02-10-2018T01:13:40,unsteddyphoenix,"Chocojellies seem gross but hey, maybe"
02-10-2018T01:14:10,Dadrobit,I'd be all over white chocolate jellies tbh/
02-10-2018T01:14:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Chocolate jelly sounds odd but maybe not gross. I’ll try most stuff at least once as long as I can
02-10-2018T01:16:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark’s too spoiled with LA food
02-10-2018T01:20:11,SpazztasticKiwi,How was seeing the dog shelter?
02-10-2018T01:31:04,Dadrobit,"I feel like eating food is a lot like listening to music, where most genres at least have /something/ to enjoy within them."
02-10-2018T01:31:14,Dadrobit,Except country.
02-10-2018T01:31:27,Bgrmystr2,"hey, even country has something to enjoy."
02-10-2018T01:31:31,Bgrmystr2,it's called bluegrass.
02-10-2018T01:31:49,Dadrobit,Pop country I'm talking about.
02-10-2018T01:32:09,Bgrmystr2,That I dont know. :v
02-10-2018T01:33:56,SpazztasticKiwi,You mean that thing they claim Taylor Swift is trying to do?
02-10-2018T01:35:48,Dadrobit,"There are literally like a dozen or so songwriters that write all the music for the ""artists"" to sing and make records off of. It's gross how homogenized and soulless it all is."
02-10-2018T01:37:25,Dadrobit,Example A: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY8SwIvxj8o&t=0m20s
02-10-2018T01:38:25,Dadrobit,"Look at most ""top 40"" lists of country music, and while they might all have different singers and bands, if you look at the song credits, they all belong to the same group of song ghostwriters"
02-10-2018T01:48:43,unsteddyphoenix,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxomblR4c0g
02-10-2018T01:48:47,unsteddyphoenix,So like this?
02-10-2018T01:49:10,Dadrobit,"Nailed it, lol."
02-10-2018T01:49:24,Dadrobit,Almost forgot about Bo tbh.
02-10-2018T01:49:46,unsteddyphoenix,"Never forget about bo, yo"
02-10-2018T01:52:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t have any interest in country
02-10-2018T01:53:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I can square and line dance but most of it just seems to only get on my nerves anymore
02-10-2018T01:53:50,Bgrmystr2,there's almost always a gem in every genre of music
02-10-2018T01:54:06,Bgrmystr2,"real genres, mind you"
02-10-2018T01:56:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Some I’ll still listen to yeah
02-10-2018T01:57:16,SpazztasticKiwi,And I just realized I only have 24 hours of being 21
02-10-2018T01:58:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’ve dove a lot into Owl City, Ed Sheeran and Charlie Puth too"
02-10-2018T02:49:44,SpazztasticKiwi,🛌g night everyone
02-10-2018T02:49:52,SpazztasticKiwi,And Tom 💤

02-10-2018T11:42:32,MidNightBlue78,"yeah, that's for sure"
02-10-2018T11:42:45,TorqueEmUp,Though not that Tom had any kind of regular sleep schedule. lol
02-10-2018T11:42:51,MidNightBlue78,i hope he enjoyed his trip
02-10-2018T11:43:27,MidNightBlue78,I don't think the word schedule is in his vocabulary 😆
02-10-2018T12:45:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Not sure if it’s entirely in any of our vocabularies
02-10-2018T14:56:16,MidNightBlue78,probably not 😁
02-10-2018T17:43:20,KittyLoveless,🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐈
02-10-2018T18:03:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Hiro’s open and it’s lunch time
02-10-2018T18:44:04,SpazztasticKiwi,...though I’m not waiting an hour
02-10-2018T20:37:25,Twokinds,I slept for 14 hours!
02-10-2018T20:40:36,manticore6549,Nice
02-10-2018T20:41:33,Bgrmystr2,Sounds like you were tired
02-10-2018T20:47:27,unsteddyphoenix,Astute observations coming out from Bgr
02-10-2018T20:48:04,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-sneakysmirk:
02-10-2018T20:48:16,unsteddyphoenix,I agree with your assessment
02-10-2018T20:48:56,Twokinds,I must have needed it.
02-10-2018T20:49:08,unsteddyphoenix,"what was it like, 14 hour plane journies?"
02-10-2018T20:49:17,unsteddyphoenix,I can imagine
02-10-2018T20:49:27,Bgrmystr2,not surprising
02-10-2018T20:49:56,unsteddyphoenix,Seriously. Those are torture. Did you manage any sleep?
02-10-2018T20:50:33,Twokinds,It was four planes to get back
02-10-2018T20:50:46,Bgrmystr2,wow
02-10-2018T20:50:50,Twokinds,"Korea to China, China to LA, LA to Atlanta, Atlanta to Cincinnati"
02-10-2018T20:50:54,Twokinds,Took about two days
02-10-2018T20:51:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Explains why you said you’d not be back till the 5
02-10-2018T20:51:13,Twokinds,With all the airports and taxi rides
02-10-2018T20:51:15,SpazztasticKiwi,th
02-10-2018T20:51:21,manticore6549,wow
02-10-2018T20:51:29,Twokinds,Yeah I knew I'd need a few days to recover
02-10-2018T20:51:46,manticore6549,go right ahead
02-10-2018T20:51:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"What I figured too, either that or y’all were planning to spend a day with Mark"
02-10-2018T20:51:59,Twokinds,"Plus my house doesn't have any fresh food, so I have to go shopping."
02-10-2018T20:52:14,manticore6549,"if you need it, take it"
02-10-2018T20:52:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"Don’t know why on earth you would stay in LA, but.."
02-10-2018T20:53:12,SpazztasticKiwi,You enjoyed it though
02-10-2018T20:53:20,SpazztasticKiwi,...surely
02-10-2018T20:55:33,unsteddyphoenix,"yikes, four trips"
02-10-2018T20:56:06,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah theres no salvaging a sleep schedule after that
02-10-2018T21:11:42,Twokinds,I did spent one night at my brother's place
02-10-2018T21:17:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Cool
02-10-2018T21:18:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel I’d only be able to stand one day in LA myself
02-10-2018T21:22:56,Twokinds,It seemed nice. Didn't see much of it.
02-10-2018T21:25:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn’t get to see much of Boston when I went there either but it’s the insanity of cities I’m not fond of
02-10-2018T21:25:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Couldn’t go 10 minutes without hearing a horn honk
02-10-2018T21:27:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"And exploration is out of the question when you’d likely get yourself lost too, so there was that"
02-10-2018T21:37:56,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce: Hiya
02-10-2018T21:39:02,Ordithus,"Welcome back, Tom!"

02-10-2018T23:28:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Kitteh should not have cheesy bean n rice burritos
02-10-2018T23:29:09,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s doing a great impression of a hummer with engine trouble though
02-10-2018T23:40:55,SpazztasticKiwi,And apparently my Twitter feed boils down to Mark is getting sick (again) and everyone got that presidential alert test
