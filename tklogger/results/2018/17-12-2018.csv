17-12-2018T00:02:39,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s it. Food is swallowed whole. It’s also why some of them die in the wild - they’re too damn stubborn to spit something out if it turns out to be to big and they choke
17-12-2018T00:04:53,unsteddyphoenix,Lol

17-12-2018T00:07:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Here’s another one: their actual name is Amazon Horned Frogs. “Pax Man frog” is because everyone wants to focus on the “big mouth that consumes everything in its path” aspect

17-12-2018T00:11:33,unsteddyphoenix,Exciting!
17-12-2018T00:11:45,Ordithus,Building up a nice backlog.  When did you start working on it?
17-12-2018T00:11:48,unsteddyphoenix,Are you writing them all yourself?
17-12-2018T00:13:27,Twokinds,At the moment yes
17-12-2018T00:13:37,Twokinds,Though I will be accepting guest writers
17-12-2018T00:13:44,Twokinds,Or at least guest idea makers

17-12-2018T00:22:12,SpazztasticKiwi,what
17-12-2018T00:23:02,Twokinds,I don't know
17-12-2018T00:23:05,unsteddyphoenix,Probably nothing
17-12-2018T00:23:08,Twokinds,Probably just an open call?
17-12-2018T00:23:18,Twokinds,I need to get people who aren't crap at writing
17-12-2018T00:23:41,unsteddyphoenix,Well shit
17-12-2018T00:23:47,Twokinds,So it can't just be anyone
17-12-2018T00:24:10,Twokinds,Obviously they'd have to understand Twokinds and it's characters and style of humor
17-12-2018T00:24:22,Twokinds,But they'd also have to be good at writing a complete narrative
17-12-2018T00:25:30,unsteddyphoenix,:thinking:

17-12-2018T00:26:51,Ordithus,But it didn't really amount to anything.
17-12-2018T00:27:08,unsteddyphoenix,I heard they did a shakespear though
17-12-2018T00:27:19,Ordithus,The researchers determined monkeys are not random generators
17-12-2018T00:27:45,unsteddyphoenix,Extremely dissapointing news

17-12-2018T00:31:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Most of the ideas that go through my head may cause people to run screaming for a psychologist so
17-12-2018T00:32:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I screen most of them
17-12-2018T00:32:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Plus there’s the age gate
