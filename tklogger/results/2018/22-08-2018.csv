22-08-2018T00:28:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Early YouTube was a simple time for me. I was subbed to like 2 people
22-08-2018T00:28:18,unsteddyphoenix,Ive heard of people randomly being UNsubscribed
22-08-2018T00:28:33,SpazztasticKiwi,They‚Äôve done that to me once with Mark

22-08-2018T00:29:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah. And the only reason I found it odd is that I knew when he usually uploaded at the time
22-08-2018T00:30:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"But the notification didn‚Äôt happen, so I looked on my other social media for a reason maybe it was delayed or put off for the day"
22-08-2018T00:31:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"Nothing. So I just re searched the channel, and there it was - ‚Äúsubscribe‚Äù button was open"
22-08-2018T00:31:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Resubbed and got the notification of that days video
22-08-2018T00:32:26,SpazztasticKiwi,And it‚Äôs only happened for me on Mark and Se√°n‚Äôs channel with me
22-08-2018T00:35:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"Happened once with Felix too but that was awhile ago. It‚Äôs got to where if I don‚Äôt see Mark and Se√°n‚Äôs channel icon on my ‚Äúsubbed to‚Äù ribbon at the top of my app page, I go looking"

22-08-2018T01:04:45,SpazztasticKiwi,System check is ok so far

22-08-2018T02:32:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I also just got out of a German lesson so I have multiple words bumping around in my head
22-08-2018T02:33:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I do know the wraps probably help her blend in as an Assassin and also probably helps her range of motion. As well as prevent chest pain via constant movement
22-08-2018T02:33:27,iliar,Sometimes English people use words by unusual way for me.
22-08-2018T02:34:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm a native English speaker and I screw it sometimes. It‚Äôs the language that beats other languages up for spare letters and grammar

22-08-2018T23:09:27,Ordithus,I understand you
22-08-2018T23:12:11,Ordithus,And there's this house... one car tuckunder garage.  Except you can't park a car in it.
22-08-2018T23:14:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Uh oh
22-08-2018T23:14:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"Why, dare I ask"
22-08-2018T23:14:58,Ordithus,No access to a street or alley.  No driveway.  A rather sturdy fence between the garage and the former.
22-08-2018T23:16:42,SpazztasticKiwi,But why? Did they put it in for decoration?
22-08-2018T23:17:05,Ordithus,It's an old house.  Maybe it once could be used?  I dunno.  REJECTED

22-08-2018T23:41:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I know. It‚Äôs cool looking in person but it‚Äôs kinda in a ditch when you consider where the road passes it
22-08-2018T23:42:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Bunch of trees in the front yard too
22-08-2018T23:46:22,SpazztasticKiwi,That particular house is across the street from another that‚Äôs on sale and the Mexican restaurant we have

22-08-2018T23:59:07,Ordithus,"The first one only, and that was a long, long time ago"
