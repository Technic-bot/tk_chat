04-01-2018T00:00:08,unsteddyphoenix,The future is now
04-01-2018T00:00:09,Dadrobit,I think my game is subtly trying to tell me that I suck. I died like 4 times in a row to a bear (stupid fuckin' bear) and now Snake is hooked up to an IV bag in his helicopter.
04-01-2018T00:00:52,CrRAR,owie
04-01-2018T00:01:27,TheBeckoner,Lol what game is that?
04-01-2018T00:01:43,CrRAR,Snake... Metal Gear?
04-01-2018T00:01:50,Dadrobit,Metal Gear V
04-01-2018T00:01:56,CrRAR,nice!
04-01-2018T00:02:15,CrRAR,Kojima is totally a master of details like that
04-01-2018T00:02:26,DarthRexKing,bye
04-01-2018T00:02:32,Dadrobit,Had to start a new game. I guess I never uploaded the save before my HDD crashed.
04-01-2018T00:02:44,Dadrobit,Death Stranding Hype!
04-01-2018T00:02:51,CrRAR,hypeeeeee
04-01-2018T00:02:52,DarthRexKing,Always save.
04-01-2018T00:02:58,CrRAR,bye Darth
04-01-2018T00:03:01,CrRAR,indeed
04-01-2018T00:03:05,Dadrobit,cya darth
04-01-2018T00:03:09,DarthRexKing,Later everyone.
04-01-2018T00:03:13,DarthRexKing,Take care.
04-01-2018T00:03:19,Ordithus,:ptv-sleepy: Good night!
04-01-2018T00:03:26,Dadrobit,"I saved plenty, it's the backing up those saves that I need to do more."
04-01-2018T00:03:48,CrRAR,Norman Reedus and the wacky rambling fetus!
04-01-2018T00:04:34,Dadrobit,:thumbsup:
04-01-2018T00:07:59,TheBeckoner,"I had thought you said ""a snake"" and thats why I was confused"
04-01-2018T00:09:16,iliar,"@Twokinds Tom, could you please go to IRC? I need you help!"
04-01-2018T00:09:30,Dadrobit,Do you not regularly hook up snakes to IV bags in helicopters after getting beaten to death 4 times in a row by the same bear?
04-01-2018T00:12:02,BadFoMo,@iliar What happened?
04-01-2018T00:16:04,iliar,@BadFoMo:  I'm trying translate page into my language.
04-01-2018T00:16:17,iliar,"Phrase ""I’ve only been with one other person since I was with you. And that’s Trace."" sounds like Flora been with Sythe too."
04-01-2018T00:16:30,iliar,I'm afraid to make a mistake.
04-01-2018T00:18:49,Dadrobit,"If you mean ""sexually"", then it sure sounds like it. Not to mention that it would flat out makes sense."
04-01-2018T00:20:04,unsteddyphoenix,Would it? Why would they have sex before they got married
04-01-2018T00:20:27,unsteddyphoenix,I kind of felt like they barely spent any time alone
04-01-2018T00:20:54,Bgrmystr2,Flora may not mean it in a sense that she had sex with Sythe
04-01-2018T00:21:03,Bgrmystr2,"but just that she was with him, as a partner"
04-01-2018T00:21:11,Bgrmystr2,and that Trace was the only other partner she had.
04-01-2018T00:21:45,unsteddyphoenix,thats how I interpreted it.
04-01-2018T00:21:59,Bgrmystr2,I think it's just that.. sythe may not know where babies come from. :ptv-tease:
04-01-2018T00:22:10,Dadrobit,"Because keidran use sex to get to know each other, always just figured he was nothing special in bed."
04-01-2018T00:22:22,Bgrmystr2,that is also true.
04-01-2018T00:24:14,Bgrmystr2,"I guess I can understand sythe's logic train though, cuz he's always been under the impression that humans and keidran cannot have children"
04-01-2018T00:24:32,Bgrmystr2,and that he saw Natani as a guy
04-01-2018T00:24:42,Bgrmystr2,as the only other conclusion
04-01-2018T00:24:57,Dadrobit,"Yeah, for Sythe it makes total sense."
04-01-2018T00:25:12,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah it's the logical conclusion
04-01-2018T00:25:31,unsteddyphoenix,"Even now it probably makes more sense that Floras lying, so credit to Sythe for believing her"
04-01-2018T00:26:08,Bgrmystr2,for sure
04-01-2018T00:26:33,Bgrmystr2,It's going to make sythe question reality xD
04-01-2018T00:26:44,Dadrobit,Which also entails that he believes Raine as well.
04-01-2018T00:26:48,Bgrmystr2,yeah
04-01-2018T00:29:05,Bgrmystr2,Who would have known that Flora would be pregernant when sythe finally meets her after all that time. xD :ptv-laugh:
04-01-2018T00:35:29,Twokinds,Sythe probably wouldn't entertain the idea at all if he didn't see firsthand Raine's transformation.
04-01-2018T00:36:37,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: Flora should probably be thankful to Raine in that respect. Not that she'd know though haha
04-01-2018T00:37:17,Dadrobit,"Yeah, with Raine shapeshifting, it at least makes sense."
04-01-2018T00:38:10,Bgrmystr2,"How far back does the human / keidran not having kids go? I'm guessing this is something that has been ""tested"" back when humans and Keidran has better relations."
04-01-2018T00:38:27,Bgrmystr2,had* should say
04-01-2018T00:47:06,Twokinds,Pretty far back. It pretty much started  happening the moment humans and keidran collided.
04-01-2018T00:47:28,iliar,"@Twokinds I repeat my question. Phrase ""I’ve only been with one other person since I was with you. And that’s Trace."" sounds like Flora been with Sythe too. I need to know Flora have sex with Sythe?"
04-01-2018T00:47:58,unsteddyphoenix,or statrted not happening
04-01-2018T00:48:41,Twokinds,"Hm, it's vague, isn't it?"
04-01-2018T00:48:46,Twokinds,lol
04-01-2018T00:48:54,Bgrmystr2,that would make total sense why sythe would doubt flora then. Wonder how the world would react to a successful halfkind
04-01-2018T00:49:20,Bgrmystr2,"and yeah it's kinda vague, but I don't think it's impossible to make a conclusion from"
04-01-2018T00:49:52,Bgrmystr2,but that leaves you the benefit of whether flora and sythe did anything to your own discretion
04-01-2018T00:51:00,iliar,"@Twokinds Yes, it's vague. And I don't know how correctly translate it."
04-01-2018T00:51:03,Bgrmystr2,"the characters in the world would know, but the readerbase isn't always privy to that information. I like it as-is really. :thumbsup:"
04-01-2018T00:51:24,Bgrmystr2,translation might be a thing though
04-01-2018T00:52:02,Dadrobit,"I mean, is there no way of being ague about a relationship in your language?"
04-01-2018T00:52:06,Dadrobit,vague*
04-01-2018T00:53:10,iliar,"@Twokinds I mean, do I need to use the same vague phrase?"
04-01-2018T00:53:50,Bgrmystr2,What else would you translate it as?
04-01-2018T00:54:30,Bgrmystr2,"not being vague would change the meaning, wouldn't it?"
04-01-2018T00:56:54,unsteddyphoenix,a m b i g u o u s
04-01-2018T01:01:30,unsteddyphoenix,"Why wouldn't you, anyway"
04-01-2018T01:01:43,unsteddyphoenix,Just translate it as exact as you can
04-01-2018T01:02:27,iliar,"@Bgrmystr2 It's hard to explain. Sometimes words work differently in different languages. And very hard to find right words, when you not completely sure what this phrase mean."
04-01-2018T01:02:56,unsteddyphoenix,Noone is~
04-01-2018T01:12:02,TheBeckoner,Why does it say you are a bot account @iliar?
04-01-2018T01:13:01,iliar,It's a secret)
04-01-2018T01:13:53,iliar,Kill All Humans!!!!!
04-01-2018T01:15:00,TheBeckoner,Ah I see. Not so secret now?
04-01-2018T01:16:01,iliar,EXTERMINATE!
04-01-2018T01:16:43,TheBeckoner,Well then.
04-01-2018T01:17:31,BadFoMo,Annihilate! Destroy!
04-01-2018T01:25:05,iliar,@TheBeckoner  Fact in that. Sometimes Picarto loses stream records. This account using bot who recording streams.
04-01-2018T01:32:18,TheBeckoner,Oh so you have a script or something that records streams?
04-01-2018T01:33:23,iliar,Yes
04-01-2018T01:36:00,TheBeckoner,"Cool, are you the one that uploads them to youtube as well?"
04-01-2018T01:36:42,Bgrmystr2,I'm not a fan of the new site design
04-01-2018T01:38:55,iliar,Yes. I uploads them to youtube https://www.youtube.com/c/TwoKindsStreams
04-01-2018T01:39:15,Dadrobit,What new site design?
04-01-2018T01:39:45,TheBeckoner,"Ok, good to know! I sub'd :smile:"
04-01-2018T01:40:02,TheBeckoner,Picarto had an update
04-01-2018T01:41:18,Dadrobit,"Ah, I see."
04-01-2018T01:42:23,Dadrobit,"I like it, more focus is put on the actual stream, while everything else is separated and more subdued."
04-01-2018T01:42:53,Twokinds,Haha
04-01-2018T01:43:04,Twokinds,I just watched one of the time lapses for the first time
04-01-2018T01:43:15,Twokinds,"It's hilarious when a bounce happens, and then just a parade of emotes"
04-01-2018T01:43:18,Twokinds,Super speed
04-01-2018T01:43:28,Dadrobit,"Lol, I'll have to check one out."
04-01-2018T01:46:01,TheBeckoner,"I watch them from time to time, they do get a bit nuts at the bounce parts lol"
04-01-2018T01:48:07,Dadrobit,"Good lord, the Flora butt dance emote needs an epilepsy warning when it's sped up like that..."
04-01-2018T01:48:26,TheBeckoner,The Kat one seems oddly smooth
04-01-2018T01:48:31,TheBeckoner,sped up
04-01-2018T01:48:54,unsteddyphoenix,Makes sense to me
04-01-2018T01:56:57,Bgrmystr2,"lol dadro, I don't like the update cuz it makes everything stand out moreso than it did before the change"
04-01-2018T01:57:18,Bgrmystr2,"it actually does the opposite of what you like it for, for me"
04-01-2018T01:58:01,TheBeckoner,Looks largely the same to me.
04-01-2018T01:59:44,Bgrmystr2,"it's pretty different, I can upload the differences"
04-01-2018T02:00:13,TheBeckoner,Honestly that'd be cool since I don't  pay attention
04-01-2018T02:02:51,Bgrmystr2,Old one https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/250139544517607424/398732887979065345/firefox_2018-01-05_01-01-09.png
04-01-2018T02:02:55,Bgrmystr2,and new one https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/250139544517607424/398732873152200705/firefox_2018-01-05_01-01-00.png
04-01-2018T02:03:12,Bgrmystr2,"the differences are slight, but noticable for me"
04-01-2018T02:03:30,Bgrmystr2,"it highlights the whole box for typing instead of just under it, dragging your eye away from it"
04-01-2018T02:04:02,Bgrmystr2,the face is bigger as well
04-01-2018T02:04:40,Bgrmystr2,the bar at the top of the chat as well as above the stream is lower on the new version
04-01-2018T02:05:06,TheBeckoner,"Idk, it seem more minimalist to me. Either way Im ok with it. And I guess the face is bigger, but everything else seems to have gotten darker/smaller"
04-01-2018T02:05:15,Bgrmystr2,and on the new page the top bar fades into the stream rather than an abupt change
04-01-2018T02:05:20,Bgrmystr2,which covers the stream somewhat
04-01-2018T02:06:25,TheBeckoner,Honestly after switching between them I like the new one more
04-01-2018T02:06:49,TheBeckoner,gUeSs i'M wEiRd
04-01-2018T02:07:20,Bgrmystr2,"Naw, old one is more minimalist. the only thing that was changed is the icons on the top bar, which is smaller. but they made everything else bigger and more in your face."
04-01-2018T02:07:36,Bgrmystr2,the search bar is a big ol box with it's own color rather than just a line
04-01-2018T02:07:42,Bgrmystr2,the opposite of minimalist :P
04-01-2018T02:07:50,Bgrmystr2,same with the typing box at the bottom
04-01-2018T02:12:38,Bgrmystr2,where was it that tom bounced in the timelapse? :o trying to find it
04-01-2018T02:12:42,TheBeckoner,Guess you're right on the search bar. I do like color more however.
04-01-2018T02:14:14,TheBeckoner,I just found the Slightly damned stream ^-^
04-01-2018T02:15:50,Bgrmystr2,XD I found it
04-01-2018T02:17:18,TheBeckoner,The bounce or the SD stream?
04-01-2018T02:18:32,Bgrmystr2,"oh, the bounce"
04-01-2018T02:18:46,Bgrmystr2,I was never looking for the SD stream
04-01-2018T02:18:47,Bgrmystr2,you were.
04-01-2018T02:19:51,TheBeckoner,"Yeah I know, I was just wondering which thing you were referring to."
04-01-2018T02:21:20,Bgrmystr2,dunno why you'd think I was looking for the SD stream when I already said what I was lookin for :P
04-01-2018T02:23:04,TheBeckoner,"Well glad you found the bounce, what stream was it on?"
04-01-2018T02:24:49,Bgrmystr2,"oh, today's stream"
04-01-2018T02:24:59,Bgrmystr2,"well, yesterday's"
04-01-2018T02:25:02,Bgrmystr2,technically now
04-01-2018T02:25:06,Bgrmystr2,since it's 1am
04-01-2018T02:25:08,Bgrmystr2,but whatever
04-01-2018T02:25:21,TheBeckoner,It aint tomorrow til I sleep
04-01-2018T02:25:38,Bgrmystr2,damn right :thumbsup::ptv-victory:
04-01-2018T02:27:03,TheBeckoner,"If I wake up Monday and don't sleep til wednesday, the day after Wednesday is Tuesday as far as I can tell."
04-01-2018T02:28:57,Bgrmystr2,I.. :thinking: yeah I don't think it works that way
04-01-2018T02:29:03,Bgrmystr2,"it's only ""tomorrow"""
04-01-2018T02:29:08,Bgrmystr2,it's not based on the actual day
04-01-2018T02:32:41,TheBeckoner,Well I guess that works better.
04-01-2018T02:32:42,TheBeckoner,Or
04-01-2018T02:32:54,TheBeckoner,we can rename all the days for my sake everytime I dont sleep.
04-01-2018T02:33:00,Bgrmystr2,uhh
04-01-2018T02:33:01,Bgrmystr2,xD
04-01-2018T02:33:04,Bgrmystr2,good luck with that
04-01-2018T02:33:16,TheBeckoner,Think about it
04-01-2018T02:33:24,TheBeckoner,We can get rid of monday
04-01-2018T02:33:41,Bgrmystr2,yes but some other day will then need to take it
04-01-2018T02:33:46,Bgrmystr2,a day that's better than monday
04-01-2018T02:33:50,Bgrmystr2,it doesn't deserve that.
04-01-2018T02:38:23,TheBeckoner,Then we can set up a rotation
04-01-2018T02:43:30,Bgrmystr2,eh
04-01-2018T02:43:38,Bgrmystr2,we can just leave monday to be it's own thing
04-01-2018T02:43:41,Bgrmystr2,and let everyone hate it
04-01-2018T02:43:47,Bgrmystr2,that way noone has to take it's job
04-01-2018T02:58:38,TheBeckoner,Well Bgr I'm ready for Friday. Goodnight.
04-01-2018T03:11:37,Bgrmystr2,:thumbsup: gnight
04-01-2018T12:07:38,Terryschannel,"If I say start a stream for long enough, one should start"

04-01-2018T17:38:19,Bgrmystr2,the upload is the stream itself. it's going to be the same size
04-01-2018T17:38:37,Bgrmystr2,"if anything, sometimes the upload is more compressed than the stream proper"

04-01-2018T19:57:44,LeKnightWolf,(if afternoon was used incorrectly as it was mean't to be used then i would like to be told so as to what it means)
04-01-2018T19:58:19,TheBeckoner,afternoon literally means after 12 o'clock pm
04-01-2018T19:58:33,TheBeckoner,It is currently evening in the CST zone

04-01-2018T22:34:04,unsteddyphoenix,"They just like paying money, Iguess."

04-01-2018T22:34:12,RyanReaper,"It’s to late now but I feel like it would be a nice touch for Keith hair to be layed back, kinda exposing his forehead cuz hes got his head laying back in Natani lap"

04-01-2018T22:34:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,quick card holders help me push my ships
04-01-2018T22:34:31,Mihari,And the two usually go hand in hand
04-01-2018T22:34:44,unsteddyphoenix,No pick me I got you card holders~
04-01-2018T22:34:50,SageSaga,im ok with a little political talk but know it can be shut down at any time
04-01-2018T22:34:58,CrRAR,They obvsly missed the boat
04-01-2018T22:35:08,CrRAR,Waiting for the next one XD
04-01-2018T22:35:09,LeKnightWolf,the ship sailed too soon
04-01-2018T22:35:15,LeKnightWolf,for us to catch it on time
04-01-2018T22:35:21,Bespin,r u gonna color this kat
04-01-2018T22:35:22,Bespin,Or
04-01-2018T22:35:24,Serpentfrog,:ptv-shipit: Have another.
04-01-2018T22:35:25,Mustanglvr007,What if the world of TwoKinds became real?
04-01-2018T22:35:26,Mustanglvr007,?
04-01-2018T22:35:27,CrRAR,Sometimes you gotta swim
04-01-2018T22:35:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,don't listen to the kiwi card holders
04-01-2018T22:35:33,Russianconservative,2nd charter of Canadian rights and freedoms I hate writing that it’s long it should be 2nd charter and it be fine like wtf canada
04-01-2018T22:35:35,ZRO4825,I ship nothing. No one pays enough.
04-01-2018T22:35:35,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe he just wants to look at Kat for a bit.
04-01-2018T22:35:36,SageSaga,mostly because people arent usually educated enough to see the whole picture when it come to internation politics - i do a lot of reading and even im not able to talk about all of it
04-01-2018T22:35:39,unsteddyphoenix,I know that feeling~
04-01-2018T22:35:44,Russianconservative,I am
04-01-2018T22:35:55,CrRAR,sink or swim brahhh
04-01-2018T22:35:57,Bgrmystr2,"there'd be a lot of problems, Mustang"
04-01-2018T22:36:04,SageSaga,considering your name i dont agree
04-01-2018T22:36:04,Serpentfrog,"You don't even ship Earth chan, Zro?"
04-01-2018T22:36:07,CrRAR,Kat looks sexy both ways!
04-01-2018T22:36:08,Russianconservative,I do too much research all my ‘friends’ hate me
04-01-2018T22:36:09,SuperLebensmude,"Hey Tom, if you raise her tail a bit you can get a nice ""C"" curve line of action going on. I think it'd make the composition interesting."
04-01-2018T22:36:11,CrRAR,I can't decide!
04-01-2018T22:36:12,Bespin,I can just look at Kat shes my fav
04-01-2018T22:36:22,ZahnHolley,I dont want any trouble because i didnt mean to say it guys.
04-01-2018T22:36:28,ZRO4825,I most definitely do not ship Earth-chan. No one takes her well being into account.
04-01-2018T22:36:29,Russianconservative,Mine?
04-01-2018T22:36:30,unsteddyphoenix,When her dots are flipped it's really uncanny
04-01-2018T22:36:35,CrRAR,Though she does look more mischevious this way
04-01-2018T22:36:40,CrRAR,...for some reason
04-01-2018T22:36:49,Bgrmystr2,"noone takes ANYONE's well-being into account with ships, zro"
04-01-2018T22:36:53,Bgrmystr2,that's not how ships work
04-01-2018T22:36:55,Russianconservative,My friends hate me for a reason I ruin their lives with facts
04-01-2018T22:36:57,Serpentfrog,What about the moon? It's a yandere bujt Earth can never see its dark side.
04-01-2018T22:37:06,ZRO4825,The only shipping I do is ship shipping ships.
04-01-2018T22:37:06,Serpentfrog,*but
04-01-2018T22:37:17,SageSaga,you are a terrible friend
04-01-2018T22:37:17,CrRAR,shipple ships
04-01-2018T22:37:20,Mustanglvr007,Question for everyone. What if Twokinds became real??
04-01-2018T22:37:21,Russianconservative,Yup
04-01-2018T22:37:25,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shipit: good man zro
04-01-2018T22:37:33,Dadrobit,Watch it or you might cut yourself on that edge.
04-01-2018T22:37:35,CrRAR,I would explore the lands~
04-01-2018T22:37:44,ZRO4825,Keidran would have restraining orders against most of us. That's what'd happen to us if Twokinds became real.
04-01-2018T22:37:50,Russianconservative,Don’t feel bad about it plus it’s fun to see the happiness go out in their eyes
04-01-2018T22:37:54,CrRAR,might die with all the rambling Templars tho
04-01-2018T22:37:59,Mustanglvr007,True
04-01-2018T22:38:03,SageSaga,cool- you can stop talking now
04-01-2018T22:38:07,Russianconservative,Ok
04-01-2018T22:38:08,Bgrmystr2,hell of a lot of chaos with the magic and stuff
04-01-2018T22:38:09,Russianconservative,Sorry
04-01-2018T22:38:15,Mustanglvr007,But we have the firepower
04-01-2018T22:38:35,MadMaxton,I'd probably try to become like Trace in terms of magical skill but end up like Red.
04-01-2018T22:38:43,CrRAR,ha
04-01-2018T22:38:49,ZRO4825,With great firepower comes great difficulty in proper aiming.
04-01-2018T22:39:04,LeKnightWolf,what
04-01-2018T22:39:06,Mustanglvr007,I'd probably end up living with Keidran
04-01-2018T22:39:21,HankTheTank45,"if firepower is great enough, no aiming required"
04-01-2018T22:39:32,Combak,* Shoots self *
04-01-2018T22:39:42,SuperLebensmude,I wonder if anthropomorphic Oxen race exists in TwoKinds. I would love to see them conduct flex battles. XD
04-01-2018T22:39:42,Bgrmystr2,we're limited by our physical reliance on science. Much of the magic in twokinds is unexplained and more than likely unexplored
04-01-2018T22:39:46,Mustanglvr007,Trying to keep myself away from the pesky ass Templars
04-01-2018T22:39:49,Bgrmystr2,they have way more destructive potential.
04-01-2018T22:39:49,Combak,You sure about that Hank?
04-01-2018T22:39:50,MadMaxton,I think the population of Lyn'Knoll would explode with how people are in our world.
04-01-2018T22:39:55,SuperLebensmude,They'd just walk up to each other and flex 24/7 to establish dominance over a territory.
04-01-2018T22:40:00,HankTheTank45,very sure
04-01-2018T22:40:06,unsteddyphoenix,Nero what are you drawing
04-01-2018T22:40:09,unsteddyphoenix,Oh It's.
04-01-2018T22:40:10,unsteddyphoenix,Nvm.
04-01-2018T22:40:13,unsteddyphoenix,I see what it is.
04-01-2018T22:40:18,Combak,"Nope, just felines and canines @SuperLebensmude."
04-01-2018T22:40:25,Twokinds,This was one of the early patreon sketches.
04-01-2018T22:40:28,ZRO4825,LOL Ron
04-01-2018T22:40:30,Mustanglvr007,Cool
04-01-2018T22:40:32,CrRAR,oooOo
04-01-2018T22:40:35,Twokinds,"It wasn't that long ago, but my style's still changed a bit."
04-01-2018T22:40:35,Serpentfrog,Introduce more humans and humans instantly establish global dominance.
04-01-2018T22:40:36,Bgrmystr2,xD Zro yeah
04-01-2018T22:40:40,Bgrmystr2,you missed that chat
04-01-2018T22:41:05,unsteddyphoenix,"I did feel like it had changed some, I couldnt really perceive a difference consciously though"
04-01-2018T22:41:06,Mustanglvr007,"I bet you, there would be WWIII"
04-01-2018T22:41:26,SageSaga,im disappointed Nero
04-01-2018T22:41:27,MadMaxton,"But it was said that lizard people  and merfolk exist far away, ox-human could exist, could they?"
04-01-2018T22:41:32,ZizzoGaming,I'm back guys.
04-01-2018T22:41:34,unsteddyphoenix,I approve Nero

04-01-2018T22:41:47,Bgrmystr2,"dunno tom, looks pretty similar to your artstyle now"
04-01-2018T22:41:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,love it Nero
04-01-2018T22:41:48,SageSaga,you had a chance to do something amazing and you went with good instead
04-01-2018T22:41:54,Serpentfrog,"With the people who don't have guns, right. That's called a massacre, not a war."
04-01-2018T22:42:02,Mustanglvr007,"Between us normal humans, the Keidran, the Basitin, and the Templars"
04-01-2018T22:42:07,neropan,pls buy

04-01-2018T22:42:46,SageSaga,make it a holocover where it changes from that to a cute girl
04-01-2018T22:42:57,neropan,fiiine

04-01-2018T22:44:42,Serpentfrog,Satan being possessed by a cute girl. Turn the tables.
04-01-2018T22:44:57,ZizzoGaming,Wait is this going to be an emote?

04-01-2018T23:07:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,0_0
04-01-2018T23:07:05,Twokinds,They're two-prong. All of them. It's a problem.
04-01-2018T23:07:06,ZizzoGaming,"@Combak Uninterruptible Power Supply, so if things like that happen it doesn't destroy your PC"
04-01-2018T23:07:07,BrunoYcaro,nice meme
04-01-2018T23:07:09,unsteddyphoenix,Is that legal?
04-01-2018T23:07:10,LeKnightWolf,woah
04-01-2018T23:07:12,Bgrmystr2,that.. IS a problem
04-01-2018T23:07:14,ZRO4825,"Ahhh, good old 2-prong outlets, lol"
04-01-2018T23:07:18,MidnightBlue78,yikes!
04-01-2018T23:07:29,SageSaga,pretty sure thats not allowed in construction for most homes in most areas these days
04-01-2018T23:07:30,Combak,I doubt it's up to code.
04-01-2018T23:07:33,LeKnightWolf,indeed midnight
04-01-2018T23:07:33,Mustanglvr007,"Guys, Tom secretly lives in the legacy estate"
04-01-2018T23:07:36,CrRAR,They're legal but you can't build a new house with em
04-01-2018T23:07:43,Bgrmystr2,"The house I live in is from the 60s I think, wood paneling and everything, even we have grounds on the wall plugs"
04-01-2018T23:07:44,MidnightBlue78,"so, you always need multiplugs"
04-01-2018T23:07:45,Twokinds,It's a house from the 60s.
04-01-2018T23:07:48,sirwolfart,yeah if the house is old the breaker are getting warn-out then
04-01-2018T23:07:54,Russianconservative,That explains it
04-01-2018T23:07:54,Combak,"It's a legacy estate, that's for sure..."
04-01-2018T23:07:54,HankTheTank45,the good old days
04-01-2018T23:08:00,CrRAR,Are any of your house light switches weird push button ones?
04-01-2018T23:08:01,LeKnightWolf,mustang if that were the case he wouldn't be able to live with Trace lol
04-01-2018T23:08:05,LeKnightWolf,for long anyway
04-01-2018T23:08:08,Twokinds,I wish I could get the plugs changed to ones with grounding
04-01-2018T23:08:08,Serpentfrog,"Beakers gonna break, break, break."
04-01-2018T23:08:12,CrRAR,My grandparents had weird pushbutton ones
04-01-2018T23:08:14,MidnightBlue78,imagine how much it would cost replace all that
04-01-2018T23:08:18,Russianconservative,When no one cared about anything
04-01-2018T23:08:18,unsteddyphoenix,is that not possible?
04-01-2018T23:08:28,Mustanglvr007,Yeah. Expensive shit
04-01-2018T23:08:28,Bgrmystr2,"It is possible, yeah, just generally time-consuming"
04-01-2018T23:08:31,Bgrmystr2,"and expensive, usually"
04-01-2018T23:08:33,Bgrmystr2,from what I hear
04-01-2018T23:08:34,Twokinds,It would require rewiring everything.
04-01-2018T23:08:37,Nekonny,deppends on the type of home
04-01-2018T23:08:41,zolstarym,My house is from the 60s. I've had to rerun some of the wiring to upgrade it and get ground
04-01-2018T23:08:43,CrRAR,"That would be vvvverrry pricy, yes"
04-01-2018T23:08:46,Russianconservative,It’s worth it
04-01-2018T23:08:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,to rewire the walls will have to come down
04-01-2018T23:08:54,SageSaga,adding a ground to the outlets wouldnt require as much work as stripping em all but still a lot of work
04-01-2018T23:08:55,Bgrmystr2,"you'd need to re-wire the ENTIRE house, basically"
04-01-2018T23:08:56,ZizzoGaming,@Twokinds see if Mark can help (financially)
04-01-2018T23:09:09,CrRAR,That's why lots of folks don't do work because as soon as you open a wall you have to bring EVERYTHING to code.
04-01-2018T23:09:11,Russianconservative,Still better than death
04-01-2018T23:09:14,Bgrmystr2,though it depends on what kinda wires
04-01-2018T23:09:24,SageSaga,Mark is too busy pretending there are ghosts for - whatever reason
04-01-2018T23:09:27,sirwolfart,"it depends on how the house was wired tom, if they ran a ground wire"
04-01-2018T23:09:32,LeKnightWolf,we back!!
