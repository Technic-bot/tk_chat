18-03-2018T00:04:21,Dadrobit,"It was pretty solid, went back t working. Feels good."
18-03-2018T00:04:51,Dadrobit,Also finally beat Morrowind today on the end of it
18-03-2018T00:05:29,Dadrobit,Yourself?
18-03-2018T00:15:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"Bagheera‚Äôs growling in his sleep. If I laugh any harder, I‚Äôll wake him up"
18-03-2018T00:15:31,TheBeckoner,Sounds good. Mostly worked. Fleet vehicle maintenance and helping a friend with his car.
18-03-2018T00:15:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I woke him up
18-03-2018T00:15:56,TheBeckoner,"Ooh I also made a sub box for my truck with my dad, that was nice"

18-03-2018T00:16:12,TheBeckoner,Bad dream?
18-03-2018T00:16:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt know. But it was the tiniest non threatening growls I‚Äôve heard from him
18-03-2018T00:17:00,TheBeckoner,smol upsets
18-03-2018T00:17:50,SpazztasticKiwi,He is a character
18-03-2018T00:18:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm happy the shelter didn‚Äôt take him

18-03-2018T00:19:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"Where‚Äôd you get Holly, by the way Tom?"

18-03-2018T00:26:28,TheBeckoner,My mom does that but with dogs.
18-03-2018T00:26:38,TheBeckoner,Gn Vat
18-03-2018T00:26:39,Twokinds,My mother is the type of person who just likes to buy stuff
18-03-2018T00:26:43,Twokinds,"And at the time, it was pets"
18-03-2018T00:26:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve gotten hints that‚Äôs the case
18-03-2018T00:26:53,Twokinds,She also bought me a fish and two hamsters
18-03-2018T00:27:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"She feeds the dogs home cooked meals, right?"
18-03-2018T00:27:07,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao what
18-03-2018T00:27:11,TheBeckoner,Yeah. Mine is the type that feels bad for everything and has to have it.
18-03-2018T00:27:13,Dadrobit,cya vat
18-03-2018T00:27:14,Twokinds,And a puppy
18-03-2018T00:27:16,unsteddyphoenix,Neve rheard of an impulse shopper who buy pets
18-03-2018T00:27:22,Twokinds,And four other puppies
18-03-2018T00:27:23,unsteddyphoenix,Dear lord.
18-03-2018T00:27:26,SpazztasticKiwi,And a partridge in a pear tree
18-03-2018T00:27:26,TheBeckoner,o woa
18-03-2018T00:27:29,unsteddyphoenix,ok youre making this up
18-03-2018T00:27:43,Dadrobit,"Unfortunately, people like that do exist."
18-03-2018T00:27:45,Twokinds,Nope. We still have most of the dogs.
18-03-2018T00:28:02,Twokinds,She has four dogs now.
18-03-2018T00:28:07,TheBeckoner,puppies are like babies. Good til large
18-03-2018T00:28:10,unsteddyphoenix,I...wow.
18-03-2018T00:28:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"Lucy, Maggie, Bubble, Bell..am I missing anyone?"
18-03-2018T00:28:19,unsteddyphoenix,I cant even picture anyone doing that.
18-03-2018T00:28:26,Dadrobit,S'why animal shelters are so packed. Everyone wants puppies and kittens and buy them on impulse forgetting that they turn into dogs and cats.
18-03-2018T00:28:35,TheBeckoner,yup
18-03-2018T00:28:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Mothering instinct maybe?
18-03-2018T00:28:48,Twokinds,"One passed away last year of old age, and the one she bought me I convinced her to rehome with a friend of hers"
18-03-2018T00:28:54,Twokinds,because I just couldn't take care of a dog.
18-03-2018T00:28:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Buddi
18-03-2018T00:29:02,Dadrobit,RIP
18-03-2018T00:29:30,unsteddyphoenix,buying pets as gifts is just...not a good idea.
18-03-2018T00:29:34,Twokinds,Yeah
18-03-2018T00:29:37,SpazztasticKiwi,She has a good heart
18-03-2018T00:29:39,Dadrobit,Hard agree
18-03-2018T00:30:06,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs other ways of helping though...
18-03-2018T00:30:14,TheBeckoner,"We should make disposable pets that ""expire"" after a few days"
18-03-2018T00:30:15,Twokinds,Thankfully she's sworn off pets now
18-03-2018T00:30:18,Dadrobit,"Dogs are the best people and deserve the best treatment, otherwise don't get one"
18-03-2018T00:30:23,TheBeckoner,^
18-03-2018T00:30:25,unsteddyphoenix,Does she have a new impulse thing?
18-03-2018T00:30:35,Dadrobit,Chia Pets?
18-03-2018T00:30:36,Twokinds,Yes. She's a thrifter now.
18-03-2018T00:30:46,unsteddyphoenix,Amazing.
18-03-2018T00:30:54,Dadrobit,"Ohhhh, little knick knacks everywhere now?"
18-03-2018T00:30:56,Twokinds,She buys and sells junk she finds at flea markets hoping she'll find that million dollar painting.
18-03-2018T00:31:06,TheBeckoner,Chia pets. or like freeze dried hamsters. Kinda like sea monkeys.
18-03-2018T00:31:18,Twokinds,She brought in a fax machine the other day asking me if it was valuable.
18-03-2018T00:31:21,unsteddyphoenix,gotta make it to pawn stars
18-03-2018T00:31:26,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha
18-03-2018T00:31:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Does she not have another hobby
18-03-2018T00:31:31,TheBeckoner,Valuable 10 years ago maybe.
18-03-2018T00:31:41,unsteddyphoenix,Or in another 10 years
18-03-2018T00:31:42,Dadrobit,"""Give it a few years to appreciate in value"""
18-03-2018T00:31:44,unsteddyphoenix,ANTIQUE
18-03-2018T00:32:12,Twokinds,She's the type of person that spends anything she gets.
18-03-2018T00:32:21,Dadrobit,Oof
18-03-2018T00:32:24,SpazztasticKiwi,What happened to the manicure expert thing from last year
18-03-2018T00:32:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Forgot what that‚Äôs called
18-03-2018T00:32:35,Twokinds,I'm thankful I ended up the opposite of that.
18-03-2018T00:32:37,unsteddyphoenix,"And so, youve developed the opposite way."
18-03-2018T00:32:42,unsteddyphoenix,Classic mother-son thing
18-03-2018T00:32:55,Dadrobit,My sister is the same way.
18-03-2018T00:33:08,Bgrmystr2,"Out of sheer curiosity, tom.. do you still draw stuff after you finish streaming? Or do you take a break from drawing and do other stuff? :o"
18-03-2018T00:33:11,Dadrobit,Spends everything on her art stuffs that makes it past her kids.
18-03-2018T00:33:19,SpazztasticKiwi,My mother and sister are copies of each other
18-03-2018T00:33:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôm like my dad, and my mom doesn‚Äôt entirely like it sometimes"
18-03-2018T00:33:57,Twokinds,I'm playing Infinifactory
18-03-2018T00:34:04,Twokinds,Puzzle games help me unwind.
18-03-2018T00:34:25,Bgrmystr2,okay
18-03-2018T00:34:26,Dadrobit,"Exact opposite, puzzles stress me out"
18-03-2018T00:34:30,TheBeckoner,same
18-03-2018T00:34:31,unsteddyphoenix,Hm.
18-03-2018T00:34:34,Bgrmystr2,that's cool to know
18-03-2018T00:34:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I like swap-around puzzles and Bejeweled stuff
18-03-2018T00:35:01,unsteddyphoenix,Anyone played Into The Breach?
18-03-2018T00:35:05,Dadrobit,My mental dexterity is just not good enough
18-03-2018T00:35:08,TheBeckoner,"I'm more of a ""blow stuff up after work"" sorta guy"
18-03-2018T00:35:09,Twokinds,Yes
18-03-2018T00:35:25,Dadrobit,wasn't that a movie?
18-03-2018T00:35:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I like to blow stuff up too. But I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll blow myself up one day
18-03-2018T00:35:59,TheBeckoner,Always a fun possibility.
18-03-2018T00:36:02,unsteddyphoenix,Does that count as an unwindy puzzle game?
18-03-2018T00:36:11,unsteddyphoenix,Im really liking it so far
18-03-2018T00:36:15,Twokinds,Into The Breach is pretty puzzle-y yes.
18-03-2018T00:37:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"I also like cooking. I kind of cook when I‚Äôm stressed, though I don‚Äôt always eat any of what I cook"
18-03-2018T00:37:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm a walking pressure cooker
18-03-2018T00:37:51,unsteddyphoenix,You sound like a convenient roomate
18-03-2018T00:37:53,TheBeckoner,Hmm I play alot of Besiege. Sort of puzzle like? More building I suppose
18-03-2018T00:38:23,TheBeckoner,"""Put this egg in your mouth...I need it hard boiled"""
18-03-2018T00:38:43,Bgrmystr2,besiege is similar to a puzzle game
18-03-2018T00:38:51,Twokinds,"I just like quick, no commitment games to unwind"
18-03-2018T00:38:53,Bgrmystr2,you need to use your brain and build stuff that works in a way
18-03-2018T00:39:16,Twokinds,"Puzzle games, tower defense games."
18-03-2018T00:39:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt think anyone uses pressure cookers to boil eggs
18-03-2018T00:39:32,TheBeckoner,Yea. Idk I guess its an exception. After so many hours its very easy to play now.
18-03-2018T00:39:34,Dadrobit,Tower Defense I can get behind
18-03-2018T00:39:35,Bgrmystr2,"it's not a puzzle of solving a map, it's a puzzle of building a structure, or in that game's case, a weapon of scary flamethrows and buzzsaws"
18-03-2018T00:39:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Ever play resource management games
18-03-2018T00:40:04,Twokinds,Like what?
18-03-2018T00:40:06,TheBeckoner,I try more for cars and suspension Bgr. Sorta my goal with that game
18-03-2018T00:40:20,Dadrobit,"But I'm taking a gaming break after Morrowind, gotta do something else so I don't get lazy..."
18-03-2018T00:40:21,TheBeckoner,And I like TD games alot.
18-03-2018T00:40:39,Bgrmystr2,"lol, tower defense games are okay, I played a few"
18-03-2018T00:40:49,SpazztasticKiwi,You ask and now my brain has blanked
18-03-2018T00:40:53,Dadrobit,Like Cities Skylines?
18-03-2018T00:40:54,Bgrmystr2,"but once you learn how to deal with the wave, it's just kinda boring :/"
18-03-2018T00:41:00,TheBeckoner,There was one called fieldrunners I believe? Very fun imo
18-03-2018T00:41:02,Bgrmystr2,I know tom was a fan of SimCity 3000
18-03-2018T00:41:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Monster Legends is the only thing that comes to mind
18-03-2018T00:41:19,Dadrobit,Been a while since that ost came into the mix
18-03-2018T00:41:25,Bgrmystr2,yeh
18-03-2018T00:41:31,SpazztasticKiwi,But I‚Äôm not entirely sure that counts
18-03-2018T00:41:32,Bgrmystr2,It's tom's fault I had to go and find it
18-03-2018T00:41:40,Twokinds,I'm not familiar with Monster Legends.
18-03-2018T00:41:47,Bgrmystr2,SC3k is still managing resources
18-03-2018T00:41:55,Twokinds,Does Factorio count as resource management? I like that game a lot.
18-03-2018T00:42:06,Bgrmystr2,probably
18-03-2018T00:42:08,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs like virtual pet/ pvp game
18-03-2018T00:42:20,unsteddyphoenix,Heard a lot about that game
18-03-2018T00:42:28,SpazztasticKiwi,My favorite monster is Tempest
18-03-2018T00:43:08,SpazztasticKiwi,He‚Äôs an electric legendary monster
18-03-2018T00:43:42,TheBeckoner,There was a mobile  game a long while ago called Roboapocalypse. Super fun game but it's gone now...Basically like starcraft I guess
18-03-2018T00:44:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"It‚Äôs more of a mobile app to spend a car ride on, but I play it because my sister‚Äôs on it too and we‚Äôre on the same team"
18-03-2018T00:45:03,Bgrmystr2,I'm less of a fan of games like starcraft
18-03-2018T00:45:10,Bgrmystr2,gotta babysit every single unit
18-03-2018T00:45:16,Bgrmystr2,no thanks
18-03-2018T00:45:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not a fan of that kind of thing either
18-03-2018T00:45:33,Bgrmystr2,"give me a real rts, large theatres of war"
18-03-2018T00:45:45,Bgrmystr2,I'll focus on the actual important stuff
18-03-2018T00:45:46,TheBeckoner,"Im not sure if I liked the way it played, the storyline or the aesthetic tbh"
18-03-2018T00:45:52,SpazztasticKiwi,But ML is on the App Store or you can play it through Facebook
18-03-2018T00:48:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"And I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm about to move or if I‚Äôm just now noticing, but FB has been showing me the listing of local houses for sale"
18-03-2018T00:48:27,TheBeckoner,Creepin on yah
18-03-2018T00:48:38,TheBeckoner,Mister zuckerberg
18-03-2018T00:49:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"But the problem is, they‚Äôre mainly 3 and 2 bedroom houses. Too big for just me and two cats and a frog"
18-03-2018T00:49:28,TheBeckoner,I just saw a shooting star!
18-03-2018T00:49:29,unsteddyphoenix,you seen those videos where a dude  purposely has a phone convo about catfood with a friend while not owning a cat
18-03-2018T00:49:35,TheBeckoner,For like a solid 2 seconds!
18-03-2018T00:49:35,Twokinds,3 bedrooms - one for each cat and the frog
18-03-2018T00:49:39,Twokinds,You can sleep on the couch
18-03-2018T00:49:41,unsteddyphoenix,And then the next day has ads about catfood?
18-03-2018T00:49:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Smartass
18-03-2018T00:49:56,unsteddyphoenix,makes sense
18-03-2018T00:50:17,unsteddyphoenix,Im surprised Holly lets you into her room so much Tom :thinking:
18-03-2018T00:50:22,Twokinds,lol
18-03-2018T00:50:30,unsteddyphoenix,Must like you
18-03-2018T00:50:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Peeks just needs a ten gallon tank. Pax Man frogs don‚Äôt move except to lunge at food and mate
18-03-2018T00:50:58,Twokinds,I'm looking for a house that's at least 2000 sq ft
18-03-2018T00:51:09,SpazztasticKiwi,And some of them don‚Äôt bother to move to mate
18-03-2018T00:51:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"If the grounds are too far away, they stay at ‚Äúhome‚Äù"
18-03-2018T00:51:31,unsteddyphoenix,Would you take your cat with you when you move?
18-03-2018T00:51:40,Twokinds,Yeah
18-03-2018T00:51:57,Twokinds,She won't like that. She doesn't like change any more than I do.
18-03-2018T00:52:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"Some of these houses are that big, and I saw one nestled in a woodsy area too"
18-03-2018T00:52:17,unsteddyphoenix,But she likes you and you like her~ :ctwokinds-daydreamingkat:
18-03-2018T00:52:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"Very tempting, but still a bit big"
18-03-2018T00:52:54,Twokinds,All the houses near the city are all boxes
18-03-2018T00:53:11,TheBeckoner,Make ur own box
18-03-2018T00:53:12,Twokinds,Eugh. I don't like that square shaped city house style
18-03-2018T00:53:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Another reason to stay out on the country
18-03-2018T00:53:26,Twokinds,"I don't know what it's called, so I dunno if you know what I mean"
18-03-2018T00:53:42,TheBeckoner,Country is nice. Lose a bit of convenience...but much quieter.
18-03-2018T00:53:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Claustrophobia?
18-03-2018T00:53:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Not a fan of neighbors?
18-03-2018T00:54:01,TheBeckoner,Me?
18-03-2018T00:54:05,Twokinds,It's just... really packed houses that are narrow from the front
18-03-2018T00:54:18,Twokinds,Every house is like that near Cincinnati
18-03-2018T00:54:28,unsteddyphoenix,Those houses that all look the same and are really close to each other?
18-03-2018T00:54:30,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I do, I wanna get one of the houses on the outer edge of the city, one of the nice pueblo lookin' ones with a decent ranch."
18-03-2018T00:54:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"Come on down to The Woods, where you can do pretty much whatever the hell you please"
18-03-2018T00:55:05,Bgrmystr2,"Shotgun house, Tom?"
18-03-2018T00:55:13,Dadrobit,Or like Spazz up in the wooded areas. Like Greer or Flag.
18-03-2018T00:55:26,Bgrmystr2,"Shotgun houses are the ones that are not wide at all, but they're long from front to backl"
18-03-2018T00:55:47,TheBeckoner,I live in a barn house thing
18-03-2018T00:55:58,Bgrmystr2,"prolly the width of a 2 car garage or so, I guess, on average"

18-03-2018T00:57:40,SpazztasticKiwi,The type of house you want/get also depends on how far you‚Äôre willing to move your stuff

18-03-2018T00:59:29,TheBeckoner,Super narrow
18-03-2018T00:59:30,Dadrobit,I lived in a trailer for a year with a bigger bathroom.
18-03-2018T00:59:31,Twokinds,That's how all the houses are near the city. Pretty much.
18-03-2018T00:59:34,Bgrmystr2,aww

18-03-2018T01:00:32,Twokinds,And Amazon Prime Now would be a plus. But I doubt it.
18-03-2018T01:01:06,Bgrmystr2,"if anything, tom, you can buy two lots and build a house close to the city"
18-03-2018T01:01:07,TheBeckoner,Mmm my internet suck here

18-03-2018T01:01:19,Bgrmystr2,so you get your house the way you want but close enough to have the net and stuff you want too

18-03-2018T01:03:53,Bgrmystr2,You know what I grew up in?
18-03-2018T01:04:02,Dadrobit,"Those desert houses are real popular on the city outskirts, but they're getting more and more crowded."

18-03-2018T01:04:45,Dadrobit,"Grandma owns one, used to have a clear sightline to the mountains, now they're totally surrounded by other houses"
18-03-2018T01:04:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Pretty on the outside
18-03-2018T01:05:02,Bgrmystr2,my parents built that house.
18-03-2018T01:05:15,Bgrmystr2,I wanna get another like it.
18-03-2018T01:05:34,TheBeckoner,I'd like a 40-50's style house
18-03-2018T01:05:44,TheBeckoner,with a nice old car in the driveway...
18-03-2018T01:05:59,SpazztasticKiwi,My grandma owns land that was wooded when she bought it and it‚Äôs still wooded. She ain‚Äôt selling to anyone who‚Äôs going to tear it up
18-03-2018T01:08:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"She did sell an old plot to a distant cousin, but he kept it as a pasture for horses. Unfortunately, he plans to build a new house over the old one and make a ranch for the public"
18-03-2018T01:08:17,TheBeckoner,The guy next to us has 80 acres. Would be great to have.
18-03-2018T01:08:47,TheBeckoner,Would have direct access to the main road that way...
18-03-2018T01:09:26,unsteddyphoenix,Declare war for his land
18-03-2018T01:09:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôm sure if someone reasonable asked, she‚Äôd sell some more property off. We‚Äôre out in the country but still get lovely internet"
18-03-2018T01:10:09,TheBeckoner,If that was acceptable it would be loads of fun...
18-03-2018T01:11:03,TheBeckoner,"But nah, he wants waaaaaayyyy too much money right now. However his kids dont really care about it. He does and we do but they dont, which means they would probably sell for cheaper."
18-03-2018T01:11:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"I used to think of moving out of state, but I‚Äôm not sure about the stress that‚Äôd put on Kiwi"
18-03-2018T01:13:41,Dadrobit,"There we go, found a mostly non incriminating photo. Grandparents ended up erecting a wall to block the houses, but when I was a kid, it was just straight desert right up to the mountains."

18-03-2018T01:14:43,Dadrobit,And the mountain is a super fun climb
18-03-2018T01:14:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"When I dyed my hair red, she didn‚Äôt want anything to do with me until I said something"
18-03-2018T01:14:57,TheBeckoner,I was gonna say. I would be all over that thing.
18-03-2018T01:15:10,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs a pretty view

18-03-2018T01:18:38,Dadrobit,Those buildings are functional tourist traps.
18-03-2018T01:18:50,unsteddyphoenix,"lol, they look it"

18-03-2018T02:27:50,SpazztasticKiwi,They‚Äôre only asses in intervals

18-03-2018T02:30:01,Dadrobit,First and last date. Back from the ladies room. Kat's blouse buttoned higher.
18-03-2018T02:30:26,Vatruvius,Umm...
18-03-2018T02:30:41,Bgrmystr2,yeah I've never been one for haiku
18-03-2018T02:30:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"Yeah if they button their blouse up while you‚Äôre on a date with them, you‚Äôre losing interest"
18-03-2018T02:30:50,Vatruvius,Stock to your tag lines robit
18-03-2018T02:30:53,Bgrmystr2,"it's just a bunch of random sentences, not even all proper ones"

18-03-2018T02:31:16,TheBeckoner,What was the haiku from Avatar the last airbender?
18-03-2018T02:31:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Though there is the chance a button popped out on its own and they‚Äôre fixing it
18-03-2018T02:31:23,Bgrmystr2,hello purplebirb
18-03-2018T02:31:41,TheBeckoner,that one guy did it...

18-03-2018T02:32:11,Vatruvius,Yeah...I know what you are talking about beck...
18-03-2018T02:32:16,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: Zuko's uncle?

18-03-2018T02:32:31,TheBeckoner,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7-2_gUuWK4
18-03-2018T02:32:38,Vatruvius,I think Zuko did a really bad one once...
18-03-2018T02:32:49,Bgrmystr2,"ah, was wrong"
18-03-2018T02:33:23,Vatruvius,"Yes. Sakka, of course."

18-03-2018T02:34:30,SpazztasticKiwi,That show‚Äôs supposed to be getting a new showing
18-03-2018T02:34:40,Vatruvius,Yes...that...akaghm...stupid phone autocorrect.
18-03-2018T02:34:52,SpazztasticKiwi,A transition to Legend of Korra
18-03-2018T02:35:01,Vatruvius,Hmm...
18-03-2018T02:35:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Phone tried to autocorrect that to Legend of Korea
18-03-2018T02:35:30,unsteddyphoenix,Sokka was my boy
18-03-2018T02:35:34,Vatruvius,"I can see why, the grown up flash backs in Legend of Korra were exciting."
18-03-2018T02:35:38,SpazztasticKiwi,It is not good with names
18-03-2018T02:35:52,TheBeckoner,I liked the crazy old metal bender and Zuko's uncle
18-03-2018T02:36:02,TheBeckoner,also the really flexible girl...
18-03-2018T02:36:06,unsteddyphoenix,actually Toph was the best
18-03-2018T02:36:25,Bgrmystr2,Toph was my favorite
18-03-2018T02:36:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Aang lived a child and died a child at heart
18-03-2018T02:36:28,Bgrmystr2,lil miss badass
18-03-2018T02:36:39,Vatruvius,"Lol, Twokinds: The Last Airbender group?"
18-03-2018T02:36:46,Dadrobit,"Tightly her legs close. Kat's refusal enticing. Breathlessly, Bird pleas..."

18-03-2018T02:36:57,TheBeckoner,Dad wot
18-03-2018T02:37:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Yes. Because Flora needs water bending abilities
18-03-2018T02:37:22,unsteddyphoenix,holy shit dark
18-03-2018T02:37:22,Vatruvius,"Stop dad, you are just like Eric...!"
18-03-2018T02:37:26,Dadrobit,5-7-5
18-03-2018T02:37:33,SpazztasticKiwi,She‚Äôd put her own eye out

18-03-2018T02:39:08,Dadrobit,Night Beck
18-03-2018T02:39:19,Dadrobit,Haikus are fun to play with
18-03-2018T02:39:29,Vatruvius,Goodnight
18-03-2018T02:39:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"Again, I could see Flora putting her own eye out. Or accidentally slapping Trace with a stream of water"
18-03-2018T02:40:38,unsteddyphoenix,Water bending was so unfair
18-03-2018T02:40:47,Dadrobit,Bird hopes for notice. His unexpected firmness. Her scent calls to him.
18-03-2018T02:40:50,unsteddyphoenix,Hella overpowered
18-03-2018T02:40:53,Vatruvius,"The two stories are wuite similar. Trace and Aang try to control their power, etc."
18-03-2018T02:41:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"Bath time could probably become more interesting though: ‚ÄúTrace, look. I moved the water.‚Äù ‚ÄúPut it back in the lake, Flora. Water doesn‚Äôt need to float‚Äù"
18-03-2018T02:41:23,Vatruvius,Quite*
18-03-2018T02:41:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt remember Aang having murderous tendencies
18-03-2018T02:42:30,Vatruvius,"It is a kid movie, but how many died vecause he ran away?"
18-03-2018T02:42:39,Dadrobit,"I'm tempted to haiku some ""water bending"", but that would be too lewd, even for me."
18-03-2018T02:42:44,Vatruvius,because*

18-03-2018T02:46:12,unsteddyphoenix,The only reason I havent return-haiku'd yet is because I havent got one scathing enough

18-03-2018T02:49:44,Dadrobit,"With thoughts of his Kat. Bird's dreams are fertile, shameless. Something burns inside."
18-03-2018T02:49:53,Twokinds,"It used to be, I had a bed in an attic and it got REALLY cold. It was misery. Now, I don't put up with that."
18-03-2018T02:49:58,Twokinds,"Warm bed, all the time."
18-03-2018T02:50:15,unsteddyphoenix,FERTILE.

18-03-2018T02:52:15,unsteddyphoenix,Apparently.
18-03-2018T02:52:36,unsteddyphoenix,What a contrast between that and buying 15 animals on a whim
18-03-2018T02:52:58,Twokinds,"It's complicated, but we had to put up with a lot of moving around for a while."
18-03-2018T02:53:14,Twokinds,Lotta downsizing.
18-03-2018T02:53:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"Pets normally keep your bed warm for you. Granted, Kiwi and Bagheera don‚Äôt cover much"
18-03-2018T02:53:32,Vatruvius,"I mean, first world problems type stuff...I had no bed heater, I slept under a roof..."
18-03-2018T02:53:33,unsteddyphoenix,Been there. Had to jump around like 4 houses in as many years.
18-03-2018T02:53:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"I used to have a heating blanket. Washed it, and it‚Äôs not been found since"
18-03-2018T02:53:55,Twokinds,My cat hasn't slept in my bed since her first year
18-03-2018T02:54:09,Twokinds,I think I kicked her in my sleep once and it's scared her off ever since.
18-03-2018T02:54:09,Vatruvius,:ptv-tease:
18-03-2018T02:54:13,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs probably a good thing for you

18-03-2018T02:54:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I kicked Kiwi off the bed once

18-03-2018T02:54:53,Dadrobit,"Yeah, kitty doesn't sleep with me unless it's on the couch. The bed just isn't safe."
18-03-2018T02:54:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"I stretched, heard a thump, and there she was on the floor ‚ÄúWhat the hell was that for?‚Äù"
18-03-2018T02:55:02,unsteddyphoenix,Dont kick cats guys~
18-03-2018T02:55:13,SpazztasticKiwi,It was an accident

18-03-2018T02:55:27,unsteddyphoenix,Your cats sleep at the foot of the bed?
18-03-2018T02:55:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Yep
18-03-2018T02:55:39,unsteddyphoenix,Mine just pet herself in the middle taking up as most space as possible
18-03-2018T02:55:42,Bgrmystr2,I'd prolly smother a pet in my sleep by hugging the stuffing out of it lol
18-03-2018T02:55:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"Bagheera sleeps next to me, on my hip, or in the covers mainly"
18-03-2018T02:56:25,unsteddyphoenix,Awh~ he gets snuggled up?
18-03-2018T02:56:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I once woke up wondering why there was a furry mass right up against my back

18-03-2018T02:58:07,unsteddyphoenix,'cause you keep kicking him?
18-03-2018T02:58:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"No. If I clean his eye boogs or clip his nails, he pouts"
18-03-2018T02:58:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Like a toddler
18-03-2018T02:58:48,unsteddyphoenix,they do get those eyeboogs
18-03-2018T02:59:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚ÄúI‚Äôll ignore you, but down here so you know I‚Äôm ignoring you‚Äù"
18-03-2018T03:00:04,Dadrobit,Clean the eyeboogs. She will not be too happy. But now she is clean.
18-03-2018T03:00:28,unsteddyphoenix,i have mixed feelings about your haikus
18-03-2018T03:01:03,SpazztasticKiwi,He‚Äôll back talk you too.
18-03-2018T03:01:05,Dadrobit,That was terrible. I should've quit while ahead. Now I cannot stop.

18-03-2018T03:04:16,Bgrmystr2,that is an interesting ship
18-03-2018T03:04:29,Bgrmystr2,I don't expect it to work
18-03-2018T03:04:31,Bgrmystr2,because clovis
18-03-2018T03:04:33,unsteddyphoenix,I feel like Maren could be coerced into being evil.
18-03-2018T03:04:34,Bgrmystr2,but
18-03-2018T03:04:37,SpazztasticKiwi,They‚Äôd kill each other
18-03-2018T03:04:37,Bgrmystr2,ehh

18-03-2018T03:05:08,Dadrobit,"I mean, she dated evil Trace"
18-03-2018T03:05:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Maren seems like someone who‚Äôd do something because someone else said she couldn‚Äôt
18-03-2018T03:05:28,unsteddyphoenix,She likes her a bad boy
18-03-2018T03:05:39,unsteddyphoenix,Though Clovis's sexist views would have to go real quick
18-03-2018T03:05:51,Bgrmystr2,not seeing that go away anytime soon
18-03-2018T03:05:52,Bgrmystr2,if ever
18-03-2018T03:05:58,Dadrobit,Maybe she's into that?
18-03-2018T03:06:12,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe
18-03-2018T03:06:25,Dadrobit,Dating literally Hitler does not bode well for a healthy personality.
18-03-2018T03:07:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Clovis reminds me of a Venus flytrap
18-03-2018T03:08:36,SpazztasticKiwi,But I seriously need to try to do the sleeping
18-03-2018T03:08:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I get up in a few hours
18-03-2018T03:09:00,Dadrobit,Sticky mouth of plant. Such is the Wolf's likeness. He catches his prey.
18-03-2018T03:10:06,unsteddyphoenix,Good luck
18-03-2018T03:10:16,unsteddyphoenix,Also lol
18-03-2018T03:10:25,Dadrobit,"Have a good one, Spazz."
18-03-2018T03:10:38,unsteddyphoenix,That conjures some interesting images

18-03-2018T03:12:32,unsteddyphoenix,Im pretty sure he's gonna go to bed in like 41seconds

18-03-2018T03:15:11,Dadrobit,He shoots for the sun. Days and weeks for sketch it takes. They call him Daddy.

18-03-2018T09:49:36,Vatruvius,Agh...I hate airports...and waiting...I hate them both equally the most.

18-03-2018T15:19:47,iliar,"Fun fact. People liked the text on the ""N√≥rage √† trois"" sketch so much, that I was forced to ""translate"" the color version too."
18-03-2018T15:24:51,Twokinds,"Ah, I forgot there was text on it"
18-03-2018T15:51:36,NightMeaty22,i am in a cardbord box in a pickup truck yay
18-03-2018T16:15:33,Vatruvius,Hey Tom!
18-03-2018T16:20:45,Twokinds,Hello!
18-03-2018T16:52:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"Morning folks. I just took a nap, and I believe I feel worse"
18-03-2018T16:53:56,Vatruvius,How can that be?
18-03-2018T16:54:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I still feel tired
18-03-2018T16:54:41,SpazztasticKiwi,But now I‚Äôm also kinda sore
18-03-2018T16:55:36,TheBeckoner,Also took a nap. Also feel bad lol
18-03-2018T16:55:44,TheBeckoner,more energy i suppose.
18-03-2018T16:55:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Naps are a gamble
18-03-2018T17:01:36,Twokinds,I never nap
18-03-2018T17:01:44,Twokinds,Naps are always bad for me.
18-03-2018T17:08:25,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah me too. Idk how people do it.
18-03-2018T17:08:31,unsteddyphoenix,I feel like I never hear about good naps
18-03-2018T17:08:46,unsteddyphoenix,"Only ""I napped for 3 hours and now I feel awful"" stories"
18-03-2018T17:12:25,Twokinds,That's always been my experience
18-03-2018T17:12:38,Twokinds,Naps just throw everything off. I think it's something you have to make a habit of
18-03-2018T17:12:52,Twokinds,"Like, if you nap at the same time for a week or two, you get used to it."
18-03-2018T17:13:11,Twokinds,But I don't want to end up dependant on naps.
18-03-2018T17:13:28,Twokinds,Cause then you'd just feel awful when you have to disrupt that cycle.
18-03-2018T17:14:19,unsteddyphoenix,"I have heard that like, you can reduce your sleep time by taking multiple naps in the day"
18-03-2018T17:14:29,unsteddyphoenix,And still feel good.
18-03-2018T17:14:48,unsteddyphoenix,But yeah if it's disrupted you'd probably have to start all over again
18-03-2018T17:18:05,Bgrmystr2,that's unlikely to be beneficial to your health though
18-03-2018T17:18:19,Bgrmystr2,cuz the body benefits from a longer and concentrated sleep
18-03-2018T17:18:46,Bgrmystr2,rather than a bunch of shorter sleeps where it can't calculate all the information it took in
18-03-2018T17:19:03,unsteddyphoenix,Calculate information...
18-03-2018T17:19:11,Vatruvius,"I nap sometimes, they have always been good but just really do not happen all that often. Guess I am unique...yay?"
18-03-2018T17:19:16,Bgrmystr2,Rem sleep and such lol
18-03-2018T17:19:37,unsteddyphoenix,So you have mostly bad naps? Seems standard.
18-03-2018T17:19:54,Vatruvius,"Yeah, long sleeps are needed, you have to get that deep sleep in."
18-03-2018T17:20:11,Bgrmystr2,"it's better to have all your sleep at once, far as I've read"
18-03-2018T17:20:14,unsteddyphoenix,I dont think going into rem is a perquisite of feeling well-rested
18-03-2018T17:20:27,Vatruvius,"Every nap I have is goos, I just do not nap all that often."
18-03-2018T17:20:30,Bgrmystr2,"rem kind of the whole point of sleeping, far as I recall"
18-03-2018T17:20:37,Vatruvius,Good*
18-03-2018T17:21:16,unsteddyphoenix,Shrug. I never looked into it that much since...im not gonna do naps.
18-03-2018T17:22:02,Vatruvius,"Yeah, if you get shorter and shorter periods of sleep your body will skip the other stages of sleep and just pass into rem. It is the most important stage for the body and brain."
18-03-2018T17:22:28,Bgrmystr2,:point_up_2:
18-03-2018T17:23:05,Bgrmystr2,"I'm sure people can function with naps or whatever, but I just don't see it as efficient at all"
18-03-2018T17:23:13,Bgrmystr2,because you don't benefit from it really
18-03-2018T17:23:36,Bgrmystr2,"it's just resting the physical body, which you don't really need to sleep for"
18-03-2018T17:25:29,Vatruvius,"I really only nap when low on sleep...like making it through finals I will nap on the weekend, regain the sleep I lost."
18-03-2018T17:25:59,Bgrmystr2,"I don't nap at all, myself. don't consider it worth doing. Just sleep till my body wakes up each night"
18-03-2018T17:26:07,Bgrmystr2,and I can function all day.
18-03-2018T17:26:10,Bgrmystr2,no coffee needed
18-03-2018T17:26:48,Vatruvius,I don't drink coffee either.
18-03-2018T17:27:15,Bgrmystr2,"only time I don't function is when I don't get enough sleep, which is par-for-the-course for anyone"
18-03-2018T17:28:03,Vatruvius,Which was your favorite sketch yesterday Tom?
18-03-2018T17:29:33,unsteddyphoenix,Thats my secret...I never function. :ptv-dealwithit:
18-03-2018T17:30:07,Bgrmystr2,xD
18-03-2018T17:31:33,unsteddyphoenix,"I'd love to sleep less, but it's hard to plan out sleep cycles 'cause I can never fall asleep straight away"
18-03-2018T17:31:38,unsteddyphoenix,Which messes it all up
18-03-2018T17:32:08,Bgrmystr2,"yup, that's a lack of sleep cycle that your body can't sleep straight away xD"
18-03-2018T17:32:16,Bgrmystr2,"vicious cycle, that is"
18-03-2018T17:32:53,unsteddyphoenix,Very upsettinh
18-03-2018T17:32:58,Bgrmystr2,I fall asleep pretty quick If I didn't get enough sleep the previous night.. kinda like yesterday
18-03-2018T17:33:23,Bgrmystr2,"but if It's not time to sleep yet, my body won't just sleep"
18-03-2018T17:33:28,Bgrmystr2,doesn't sleep on command..
18-03-2018T17:33:47,Bgrmystr2,such a rebellious body :ptv-unimpressed:
18-03-2018T17:34:32,unsteddyphoenix,Also the thing when youre super tired during most of the day then super awake when you actually want to go to bed ugh
18-03-2018T17:34:44,Vatruvius,"My dad passes out in 5 minutes flat, no matter what...:ptv-angry:"
18-03-2018T17:35:42,Bgrmystr2,"because he probably doesn't get enough sleep every single night, Vatru"
18-03-2018T17:35:45,unsteddyphoenix,impressive
18-03-2018T17:35:47,Bgrmystr2,it's a VERY common thing
18-03-2018T17:36:47,Vatruvius,Yeah...pretty sure he has sleep apnea.
18-03-2018T17:37:16,Vatruvius,Still pisses me off though...wish I could fall asleep that fast.
18-03-2018T17:38:19,Bgrmystr2,I don't think you do though
18-03-2018T17:39:07,Vatruvius,"Meh...fine...just a comfy, non-springy matress then."
18-03-2018T17:39:12,Bgrmystr2,xDD
18-03-2018T17:39:15,Bgrmystr2,probably better
18-03-2018T17:41:04,TheBeckoner,I have read that adheres to a napping schedule works well for getting more awake hours during the day. And pre-industrial revolution most people took two main naps everyday vs the one large one we have now. Although missing a nap totally screws you over.
18-03-2018T17:41:29,TheBeckoner,"mono sleep is the easiest because there is o risk, maybe not the most effective though."
18-03-2018T17:41:34,TheBeckoner,no*
18-03-2018T17:41:47,TheBeckoner,adhering*
18-03-2018T17:42:39,Bgrmystr2,Seems like it would take longer
18-03-2018T17:42:45,Bgrmystr2,take more time out of the day
18-03-2018T17:42:49,Bgrmystr2,to sleep twice
18-03-2018T17:43:10,TheBeckoner,In total it doesn't. Sleep twice but not for as long as you would once.
18-03-2018T17:43:38,TheBeckoner,From what I gather anything past a 3 nap a day schedule is very very hard to stick to
18-03-2018T17:43:58,Bgrmystr2,how would you function at all
18-03-2018T17:44:00,TheBeckoner,"The naps are usually spread out evenly, or based on time"
18-03-2018T17:44:03,Bgrmystr2,would you even get rem sleep?
18-03-2018T17:44:06,Bgrmystr2,at all?
18-03-2018T17:44:08,TheBeckoner,Yes
18-03-2018T17:44:23,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, you're looking at less than 3 hours per sleep"
18-03-2018T17:44:26,TheBeckoner,"Your body will adapt to getting into REM fater than normal, but the transition sucks"
18-03-2018T17:44:30,Bgrmystr2,that's hardly enough for Rem
18-03-2018T17:44:43,TheBeckoner,For a normal person yeah.
18-03-2018T17:44:49,Bgrmystr2,for most people yeah
18-03-2018T17:45:02,Bgrmystr2,that transition being lacking is what makes it not as good
18-03-2018T17:45:26,Bgrmystr2,tis probably why we largely transferred to a single long sleep from multiple shorter sleeps
18-03-2018T17:45:30,Bgrmystr2,rather than the other way around
18-03-2018T17:45:39,TheBeckoner,"People have diffrent approaches to that. Some will start taking scheduled naps, others go til exhaustion them start."
18-03-2018T17:45:51,Bgrmystr2,humanity naturally gravitates towards better and more efficient ways of sleeping.
18-03-2018T17:46:28,Bgrmystr2,a large part of people who don't sleep all at once only take naps because they don't plan to have all their sleep at once
18-03-2018T17:46:32,Bgrmystr2,it's basically bad blanning
18-03-2018T17:46:36,Bgrmystr2,planning* even
18-03-2018T17:46:42,Twokinds,I just go to bed at night and fall asleep and then wake up the next day.
18-03-2018T17:46:44,Bgrmystr2,bad planning.. blanning &gt;;c
18-03-2018T17:46:53,Bgrmystr2,"same, tom xD"
18-03-2018T17:47:02,Twokinds,"More like... bed planning, am I right?"
18-03-2018T17:47:30,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-pouty: mthrfkr take my +1 and getouttahere with yer puns! xD
18-03-2018T17:47:42,Bgrmystr2,"or don't, I ain't yer parent lol"
18-03-2018T17:47:50,TheBeckoner,I was trying a two nap deal. Once when back from school then going to bed around 2 am and waking up at 8. I felt fine but it was weird to nap mid day when everyone was about...made me feel lazy
18-03-2018T17:47:56,unsteddyphoenix,Ayyy~
18-03-2018T17:48:36,unsteddyphoenix,You mean you dont calculate the sleep-coefficients and derive the ideal sleep formula?
18-03-2018T17:48:57,TheBeckoner,I go night night in soft place
18-03-2018T17:49:02,TheBeckoner,simpleboi
18-03-2018T17:54:36,TheBeckoner,I do hear older people sleep often. I assume that is because the have less energy total after sleeping.
18-03-2018T17:56:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I took a nap because I didn‚Äôt get to sleep until late and had to wake up early this morning
18-03-2018T17:56:45,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs normally the only time I do naps
18-03-2018T17:56:50,unsteddyphoenix,"Less a nap and more ""didnt get much sleep"""
18-03-2018T17:57:09,Dadrobit,"Holy crap, people were flying on the freeway coming home today. Was doing 78 in the right lane and was getting passed like it was nothing."
18-03-2018T17:57:37,Dadrobit,feelsgoodman
18-03-2018T17:57:45,Twokinds,"If I planned my sleeps, I wouldn't be going to bed at 4am most nights."
18-03-2018T17:57:49,TheBeckoner,I got 5 hours last night and I have work to do so i needed something
18-03-2018T17:57:52,Twokinds,Dadrobit: Dats fast
18-03-2018T17:58:29,Twokinds,I'm the loser on the highway going exactly the speed limit on cruise.
18-03-2018T17:58:35,Dadrobit,"Was shadowing a cop, he just didn't care I guess. Too much paperwork."
18-03-2018T17:58:37,TheBeckoner,I try and only lose so much sleep that a 20 minute non rem sleep nap can take up for it
18-03-2018T17:59:08,Bgrmystr2,"lol Dadro, the legal thing to do is to go with the flow of traffic"
18-03-2018T17:59:08,TheBeckoner,I usually do 80 back and forth from school...just no one around
18-03-2018T17:59:18,Bgrmystr2,"if the flow of traffic is above the speed limit, you follow the flow"
18-03-2018T17:59:26,Dadrobit,I generally put it at around 9+ the limit and hit cruise control unless the flow is that much faster.
18-03-2018T17:59:32,unsteddyphoenix,Just find a streamer and plan your sleep their stream times~
18-03-2018T17:59:43,Bgrmystr2,"xD Phoenix, story of my life"
18-03-2018T17:59:49,Bgrmystr2,"cept I do it w/ two streamers, generally"
18-03-2018T17:59:52,Bgrmystr2,and still make it work
18-03-2018T17:59:56,TheBeckoner,My truck tops out at 115 and then shuts the motor off till 85 lol
18-03-2018T18:00:23,TheBeckoner,"Probably some ""stop running from the cops feature"""
18-03-2018T18:00:29,Dadrobit,"Still haven't hit the limiter on my car, dunno where it's at. At least 118...."
18-03-2018T18:00:46,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it's called a limiter."
18-03-2018T18:00:50,TheBeckoner,Yeah
18-03-2018T18:01:06,unsteddyphoenix,thats a thing?
18-03-2018T18:01:08,TheBeckoner,My dads tops out at 95. First time he figured that out he was pissed lol
18-03-2018T18:01:09,unsteddyphoenix,"Huh, clever."
18-03-2018T18:01:27,Bgrmystr2,most cars have limiters far as I'm aware
18-03-2018T18:01:29,unsteddyphoenix,It'd be cool if it auto-adjusted to the speed limit of the road youre on
18-03-2018T18:01:43,Bgrmystr2,"if you buy a car from a dealership, it most likely has a limiter"
18-03-2018T18:01:47,TheBeckoner,most sporty cars dont
18-03-2018T18:01:53,TheBeckoner,and some SUV's dont
18-03-2018T18:02:06,TheBeckoner,Most trucks and sedans do however
18-03-2018T18:02:08,Bgrmystr2,"yeah sporty cars don't, because they're not made to be bought by everyday consumers"
18-03-2018T18:02:29,Dadrobit,"The cops out here can be finicky. Haven't been pulled over in years and years, but I've gotten hit for going 5 over and 5 under."
18-03-2018T18:02:48,unsteddyphoenix,sometimes cops gotta fill a quota
18-03-2018T18:02:57,TheBeckoner,My first ticket was 60 in a 40 but the dude was nice and way reduced the ticket.
18-03-2018T18:03:03,Dadrobit,Didn't ive me tickets tho

18-03-2018T18:04:45,Dadrobit,"They can be super cool as well. I remember getting pulled over w/ my brother when we were young and he was cruising at 122. Cop pulled us over and was like, ""You know how fast you were going?"" ""..... No?"" ""Y'all were doing 85."""
18-03-2018T18:04:48,TheBeckoner,I heard of a cop that needed 6 interaction but only got 5 and got reprimanded. One of the interactions was solving a rape.

18-03-2018T18:08:15,TheBeckoner,Oh yeah
18-03-2018T18:08:25,TheBeckoner,just got one of those for a right on red
18-03-2018T18:08:30,TheBeckoner,forgot to stop
18-03-2018T18:08:34,TheBeckoner,well
18-03-2018T18:08:49,TheBeckoner,I more so thought I was gonna get hit if I hesitated.
18-03-2018T18:08:57,TheBeckoner,So i didnt stop
18-03-2018T18:09:05,Dadrobit,"""Rolling right on red"""
18-03-2018T18:09:29,Dadrobit,What's the fine for that?
18-03-2018T18:09:42,Dadrobit,Is it considered running a red light?
18-03-2018T18:09:43,TheBeckoner,"I have it right here. It says ""Failure to stop at red light"""
18-03-2018T18:09:51,Dadrobit,Oof.
18-03-2018T18:09:59,TheBeckoner,it was $75
18-03-2018T18:10:06,Dadrobit,That's not terrible.
18-03-2018T18:10:12,Dadrobit,Taking a class?
18-03-2018T18:10:23,TheBeckoner,"Nope, just paid it."
18-03-2018T18:10:34,Dadrobit,Fair 'nuff
18-03-2018T18:10:38,Twokinds,The thought of being pulled over scares me a lot.
18-03-2018T18:10:41,TheBeckoner,Not money I wanted to spend but eh it was easier
18-03-2018T18:11:25,TheBeckoner,I was fairly nervous first time. Dude could see that I guess and was pretty laid back.
18-03-2018T18:11:42,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I'm a pretty confident dude, but getting pulled over sucks no matter what."
18-03-2018T18:11:43,TheBeckoner,Hopefully you don't get an ass for a cop
18-03-2018T18:11:58,unsteddyphoenix,Are there cops racist to asians? :thinking:
18-03-2018T18:12:10,Bgrmystr2,do you really have to ask XD
18-03-2018T18:12:15,TheBeckoner,There is probably some racist to anyone lol
18-03-2018T18:12:18,Twokinds,Not that I know of. I just don't deal with unexpected human contact well.
18-03-2018T18:12:20,TheBeckoner,someone*
18-03-2018T18:12:34,unsteddyphoenix,Fair enough. One of the worst kinds of human contact
18-03-2018T18:12:39,Twokinds,I live right next to the police/fire department actually.
18-03-2018T18:12:50,unsteddyphoenix,Extra safe
18-03-2018T18:12:53,Bgrmystr2,:o
18-03-2018T18:12:58,TheBeckoner,Make them cookies as a non monetary bribe
18-03-2018T18:13:02,Twokinds,"Like, it's literally right across from our neighborhood. And it's a pretty chill community."
18-03-2018T18:13:26,unsteddyphoenix,Do you go to like. Neighbourhood BBQs or whatever?
18-03-2018T18:13:55,Twokinds,Nah
18-03-2018T18:14:06,Twokinds,Do I seem like the type that would? XD
18-03-2018T18:14:09,TheBeckoner,I would. Cant pass up free food
18-03-2018T18:14:23,Dadrobit,"Same, have a fire station at the end of my thru street"
18-03-2018T18:14:32,Twokinds,"But it's a very safe area. It should be, our local taxes are extremely high."
18-03-2018T18:15:09,Dadrobit,"Neighborhood BBQ's aren't a thing, but my neighbors and I share food every once in a while."
18-03-2018T18:15:11,unsteddyphoenix,Free food is free food~
18-03-2018T18:15:16,unsteddyphoenix,Oh thats cute
18-03-2018T18:16:01,Dadrobit,"I'm renting from my folks, and they own and rent out the adjacent houses as well, so we all kinda know each other."
18-03-2018T18:16:49,unsteddyphoenix,Thats pretty sweet. Dunno my neighbours at all. Kiiind of feel like I should meet them properly at some point but...TALKING to people urgh
18-03-2018T18:17:37,Twokinds,I'm considering just ubering full-time. It probably wouldn't be that much more expensive.
18-03-2018T18:17:56,Dadrobit,"I don't mind conversations when people approach me, but I almost never initiate anything myself."
18-03-2018T18:18:48,unsteddyphoenix,Probably not. Isnt Uber like...morally ambiguous though.
18-03-2018T18:18:58,Bgrmystr2,not imo phoenix
18-03-2018T18:19:05,Bgrmystr2,it's just another cab service
18-03-2018T18:19:11,unsteddyphoenix,Theyre so cheap 'cause they dont have to pay work-taxes like taxis do or something
18-03-2018T18:19:13,Bgrmystr2,"but people do it as a ""side job"" through an app"
18-03-2018T18:19:28,unsteddyphoenix,"So theyre like, abusing a loophole or whatever."
18-03-2018T18:19:32,Bgrmystr2,basically
18-03-2018T18:19:36,unsteddyphoenix,Which is why it's banned some places
18-03-2018T18:19:50,Bgrmystr2,that's cuz some places taxis want a monopoly
18-03-2018T18:20:02,Dadrobit,"Met a ton of Uber folks as access security. It's a mixed bag. Some are nice, plenty of cunts as well though."
18-03-2018T18:20:15,Twokinds,"Well yeah, that's humanity."
18-03-2018T18:20:17,Bgrmystr2,that's cuz Uber is made out of the populous
18-03-2018T18:21:16,Dadrobit,"I just recall hearing about a horror story form last year. Dude was using Uber to cover his tracks as a drive by shooter. Take a job on one side of the city as an alibi, shoot up the other side of the city between gigs."
18-03-2018T18:21:31,TheBeckoner,woa
18-03-2018T18:21:52,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
18-03-2018T18:21:52,unsteddyphoenix,Huh. Clearly it didnt work but it seems smart
18-03-2018T18:22:11,TheBeckoner,Yeah I watch youtube videos on uber trouble sometimes. Some  of the passengers are just ridiculous.
18-03-2018T18:22:23,Bgrmystr2,..it's just people meeting ppl
18-03-2018T18:22:29,Bgrmystr2,you're gonna have bad interactions eventually
18-03-2018T18:22:34,TheBeckoner,Yup
18-03-2018T18:22:40,TheBeckoner,pretty entertaining.
18-03-2018T18:22:46,unsteddyphoenix,Ive seen streamers who stream themselves doing uber work
18-03-2018T18:22:46,Bgrmystr2,it happens with Taxis too
18-03-2018T18:23:02,Dadrobit,"Yeah, a survivor saw the Uber sticker on is windshield and then they just went through all of them with his vehicle before he was eventually caught."
18-03-2018T18:23:04,unsteddyphoenix,and they have text-to-speech on so the chat donates to say things to the passengers out loud
18-03-2018T18:23:07,Dadrobit,his*
18-03-2018T18:23:21,Bgrmystr2,xD Phoenix
18-03-2018T18:23:23,Bgrmystr2,that sounds fun
18-03-2018T18:23:29,TheBeckoner,wow lol
18-03-2018T18:23:35,Dadrobit,Sounds like a good way to get harrassment charges.\
18-03-2018T18:23:39,TheBeckoner,^
18-03-2018T18:23:57,Bgrmystr2,"not if you inform the passenger about the stream, Dadro"
18-03-2018T18:24:02,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, some of the stuff they said was...as bad as they could make it."
18-03-2018T18:24:03,Bgrmystr2,seems kind of dumb not to
18-03-2018T18:24:13,TheBeckoner,Last thing I want as a passenger is something like that.
18-03-2018T18:24:30,Twokinds,"Yes, I'd like to request one uber, extra no talking."
18-03-2018T18:24:37,Bgrmystr2,xD ^
18-03-2018T18:24:38,TheBeckoner,I give you money you let me be.
18-03-2018T18:24:43,Dadrobit,lol
18-03-2018T18:24:52,unsteddyphoenix,"""no talking costs extra"""
18-03-2018T18:24:57,Twokinds,They should have that as an option in the app.
18-03-2018T18:25:04,TheBeckoner,Do they not?
18-03-2018T18:25:06,unsteddyphoenix,They really should.
18-03-2018T18:25:10,Bgrmystr2,"probably not, beck"
18-03-2018T18:25:17,Bgrmystr2,because it's really a human-interaction thing
18-03-2018T18:25:19,TheBeckoner,Seems pretty basic...idk
18-03-2018T18:25:26,Bgrmystr2,that's not something the app would really matter
18-03-2018T18:25:30,Twokinds,Just   :ballot_box_with_check:Silence
18-03-2018T18:25:40,Bgrmystr2,xD I don't see it happening
18-03-2018T18:25:46,TheBeckoner,I mean if I were a driver I would respect that.
18-03-2018T18:25:54,unsteddyphoenix,I would rather stare out the window doing nothing than talk to the driver
18-03-2018T18:26:21,Dadrobit,Regular cabbies are talkative people.
18-03-2018T18:26:23,unsteddyphoenix,"Man, one time I had this taxi driver try hire me to sell like, soaps and shit"
18-03-2018T18:26:34,TheBeckoner,lol wut
18-03-2018T18:26:35,Bgrmystr2,lolo
18-03-2018T18:26:38,Dadrobit,Was it through Amway?
18-03-2018T18:26:44,Dadrobit,Sounds like Amway
18-03-2018T18:26:49,Bgrmystr2,"my stepbrother does something like that, online"
18-03-2018T18:27:00,Dadrobit,Same.
18-03-2018T18:27:03,unsteddyphoenix,"Dunno, went on and on about some genius business plan and how he needed ""people he could trust"""
18-03-2018T18:27:05,Bgrmystr2,or.. ex.. stepbrother? I Don't know
18-03-2018T18:27:11,Dadrobit,Little bro is in deep with them now
18-03-2018T18:27:14,unsteddyphoenix,Like some dude you picked up at 1am in the city
18-03-2018T18:27:19,unsteddyphoenix,Apparently
18-03-2018T18:27:30,Dadrobit,Seems legit
18-03-2018T18:27:44,unsteddyphoenix,I just nodded along and gave him a fake contact number at the end.
18-03-2018T18:28:17,unsteddyphoenix,Would not recommend
18-03-2018T18:28:21,Bgrmystr2,lolo
18-03-2018T18:28:43,Twokinds,mmm mystery food delivery
18-03-2018T18:28:52,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
18-03-2018T18:28:54,TheBeckoner,?
18-03-2018T18:28:56,Dadrobit,Is it watermenlon?
18-03-2018T18:29:03,TheBeckoner,Is it people?
18-03-2018T18:29:05,Dadrobit,Watermelon*
18-03-2018T18:29:08,Twokinds,The food of the day is Indian spicy chicken curry.
18-03-2018T18:29:15,Dadrobit,So close
18-03-2018T18:29:19,unsteddyphoenix,Oo that sounds good~
18-03-2018T18:29:23,TheBeckoner,Could be people.
18-03-2018T18:29:25,Dadrobit,Literally my third guess
18-03-2018T18:29:49,unsteddyphoenix,"Curry is so good, shame im so white do I dont get to eat it much. :/"
18-03-2018T18:29:53,TheBeckoner,I could go for some chinese food right now.
18-03-2018T18:30:16,unsteddyphoenix,Very jealous of mystery food
18-03-2018T18:30:26,Bgrmystr2,"then make it, phoenix"
18-03-2018T18:30:48,Twokinds,"Mmm, it's good"
18-03-2018T18:31:17,Twokinds,"Indian curry is quite different from the Korean or Japanese curries I usually have, but I like it."
18-03-2018T18:33:30,unsteddyphoenix,Whats a korean curry like? Not sure ive had that...
18-03-2018T18:33:40,unsteddyphoenix,"Ive had thai-curry a decent amount, but"
18-03-2018T18:33:56,unsteddyphoenix,Most korean food I see is KBBQ
18-03-2018T18:34:15,Twokinds,"Oh, it's very hard to explain. It's more... savory? Thicker, with like, carrots and potatoes. More like a curry stew, put on rice. At least the type my mother makes."
18-03-2018T18:34:21,Twokinds,I'm sure there's other types.
18-03-2018T18:35:41,unsteddyphoenix,Man that sounds good...im so hungry now
18-03-2018T18:36:14,unsteddyphoenix,"Woah apparently ""curry-stew"" is a thing"
18-03-2018T18:37:12,unsteddyphoenix,def gonna try make this sometime
18-03-2018T18:37:57,Dadrobit,"Never made a curry myself, should do that eventually. All my meals tend to be Mexican food based."
18-03-2018T18:38:39,unsteddyphoenix,When in Rome...
18-03-2018T18:38:45,unsteddyphoenix,Or in your case a desert
18-03-2018T18:38:49,Dadrobit,Pretty much.
18-03-2018T18:39:12,Twokinds,"It's pretty easy. You can just get it in a box, it's called Golden Curry"
18-03-2018T18:39:26,Dadrobit,"If I have Carolina's Tortillas on hand, it's pretty much going to be tortilla based foods until I run out."
18-03-2018T18:39:39,Twokinds,That's what my mother uses. You just melt it and start mixing in your stuff.
18-03-2018T18:39:51,Dadrobit,"Hm, sounds ~Too~ easy"
18-03-2018T18:40:21,Twokinds,"Curry is meant to be pretty easy by design. It's just stuff, put on rice."
18-03-2018T18:40:39,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh, I know the ones."
18-03-2018T18:40:42,unsteddyphoenix,Different brand but
18-03-2018T18:41:06,CrRAR,Cut to next scene
18-03-2018T18:41:15,CrRAR,Phoenx's hous eon fire
18-03-2018T18:41:35,unsteddyphoenix,INflammable means FLAMMABLE?
18-03-2018T18:41:46,CrRAR,haha
18-03-2018T18:41:54,Twokinds,"One thing I really like about Indian food is they're not afraid to get spicy. In a good way. Hot, but still tastes good."
18-03-2018T18:42:13,Dadrobit,'s mouth is watering.
18-03-2018T18:42:24,CrRAR,"oh yeah, mild, regular, hot and nuclear"
18-03-2018T18:42:26,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I got up and put food on lol
18-03-2018T18:42:49,Dadrobit,"I need to hit up the local wing joint. They have some baller ghost pepper sauce that I'm out of, but is amazing for cooking."
18-03-2018T18:42:49,unsteddyphoenix,"Mild, mild again, somewhat hot, absolute destruction"
18-03-2018T18:42:53,CrRAR,You unlock nuclear by reaching at least hot without shedding a tear
18-03-2018T18:43:08,CrRAR,lol
18-03-2018T18:43:17,Twokinds,lol sorry for all the food talk XD
18-03-2018T18:43:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Y‚Äôall making me hungry
18-03-2018T18:43:27,unsteddyphoenix,Spicy food is kind of a leveling system. Up your tolerance points.
18-03-2018T18:43:28,Twokinds,"Can't help it, I love curry."
18-03-2018T18:43:45,unsteddyphoenix,Relate
18-03-2018T18:44:10,NightMeaty22,hello
18-03-2018T18:44:11,unsteddyphoenix,Surely all you really need for curry is the spices right?
18-03-2018T18:44:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve never had curry. I‚Äôd like to try it though
18-03-2018T18:44:22,Dadrobit,"All good, I know I've annoyed the chat with my food talk plenty of times lol"
18-03-2018T18:44:32,CrRAR,Get you some tikka marsala boi

18-03-2018T18:45:35,Dadrobit,Made a seven layer taco cake once if that counts.
18-03-2018T18:45:41,CrRAR,Is your 7 layer chocolate cake practically Jesus?
18-03-2018T18:45:52,NightMeaty22,üåÆüåÆüåÆüåÆüåÆüåÆüåÆ
18-03-2018T18:46:00,CrRAR,Cus I thought that's where that sentence was going.

18-03-2018T18:46:46,unsteddyphoenix,NEVER had curry?

18-03-2018T18:47:01,CrRAR,:o
18-03-2018T18:47:07,CrRAR,Godspeed
18-03-2018T18:47:27,SpazztasticKiwi,So I‚Äôm thinking of walking more
18-03-2018T18:47:35,SpazztasticKiwi,But I live on a hill
18-03-2018T18:47:58,Dadrobit,"Back, nice and quick reboot."
18-03-2018T18:48:20,unsteddyphoenix,SSD?
18-03-2018T18:48:27,unsteddyphoenix,"Roll down hill, walk ip"
18-03-2018T18:49:09,Dadrobit,"Good question, I don't think so?"
18-03-2018T18:49:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm out walking now. Something just jumped in the creek by the road
18-03-2018T18:49:32,CrRAR,frog!
18-03-2018T18:49:37,unsteddyphoenix,Doggy!
18-03-2018T18:49:49,CrRAR,dark lord agnew!
18-03-2018T18:50:02,CrRAR,the pope?
18-03-2018T18:50:05,Dadrobit,I use an external SSD for all my storage though. On my workstation laptop and the only thing I keep on here is work related programs.
18-03-2018T18:50:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Probably a frog
18-03-2018T18:50:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Hopefully
18-03-2018T18:50:24,CrRAR,aww
18-03-2018T18:50:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm also not going to investigate. We have cotton mouth snakes
18-03-2018T18:50:53,unsteddyphoenix,"External SSD, how decadent"
18-03-2018T18:50:56,CrRAR,yyyyeeeeahh
18-03-2018T18:51:06,CrRAR,best to leave that mystery unsolved
18-03-2018T18:51:22,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs a nope
18-03-2018T18:51:42,Dadrobit,Snakes sounds like a winner.
18-03-2018T18:51:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve faced off with a copperhead. No need to test a Cotten mouth
18-03-2018T18:52:03,unsteddyphoenix,Did you survive?
18-03-2018T18:52:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Tragically I died
18-03-2018T18:52:26,SpazztasticKiwi,But then I lived
18-03-2018T18:52:27,Dadrobit,F
18-03-2018T18:53:45,unsteddyphoenix,Dramatic
18-03-2018T18:53:52,unsteddyphoenix,I died but then I got better

18-03-2018T18:54:43,Dadrobit,"Arizona Kingsnakes are pretty rad. Super tame even in the wild, you can just pick those suckers up and they just chill"
18-03-2018T18:54:51,TheBeckoner,I like the non bad snakes

18-03-2018T19:01:21,Dadrobit,Never seen her mad in my life
18-03-2018T19:01:50,CrRAR,I am curious how one would judge a snake as mad.
18-03-2018T19:01:58,SpazztasticKiwi,King got hyper when he saw you with his mice
18-03-2018T19:02:13,Dadrobit,Is it coiled and hissing at you tring to avoid contact? It's pissed
18-03-2018T19:02:25,CrRAR,"oh right, right"

18-03-2018T19:47:31,Bgrmystr2,the whole idea of the suger in the chocolate is to make it sweet

18-03-2018T19:48:21,unsteddyphoenix,"Maybe 'cause it looks and feels like white chocolate, you think it tastes like white chocolate?"

18-03-2018T20:03:16,Dadrobit,"I just started working for them about three-ish months ago. They have somehing like 30 other talents that they swap in and out, this is only my 4th one, but it's cool because it's a solo piece."
18-03-2018T20:03:30,SpazztasticKiwi,And coin collection and a few other little things
18-03-2018T20:03:52,unsteddyphoenix,"Ho, seems like a large scale thing"
18-03-2018T20:04:19,SpazztasticKiwi,They have different people to come in an read for different characters?
18-03-2018T20:04:21,Dadrobit,2 of the stories I was a part of I was just one of the characters.
18-03-2018T20:04:47,Dadrobit,My first I was just the general narrator while other talent did the characters.
18-03-2018T20:05:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Sounds pretty cool
18-03-2018T20:05:17,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah you do have a narrator-ry vibe with your voice
18-03-2018T20:05:19,unsteddyphoenix,Can see that
18-03-2018T20:05:48,Dadrobit,It's pretty amazeballs.
18-03-2018T20:06:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"I know a few people that have voices like butter, but don‚Äôt want to voice act"
18-03-2018T20:07:05,Dadrobit,Just need more consistent work. I only have 3 clients that use me as consistently and they are not nearly enough to pay the bills. Always on the hunt for more work.
18-03-2018T20:07:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"Met a girl in college that had the most amazing cartoon voice, and another with a beautiful laugh"

18-03-2018T20:10:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a variety of different laughs ranging from cute little bunny giggle to run the kraken is upon us
18-03-2018T20:11:44,unsteddyphoenix,I just...laugh.
18-03-2018T20:12:01,unsteddyphoenix,So :thinking:
18-03-2018T20:12:03,Vatruvius,I really need to quit stopping by and reading what is going on in chat...:ptv-confused:
18-03-2018T20:12:42,Dadrobit,I listen to myself too much to not notice shit like how I sound when I laugh.
18-03-2018T20:13:56,unsteddyphoenix,fair enough
18-03-2018T20:21:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôm talking about the different kind of laughs: shocked, trying but failing to not laugh, and so on"

18-03-2018T20:26:52,SpazztasticKiwi,You climb a flagpole for the sole reason to sit on top and balance enough to say you did it or pose in some way
18-03-2018T20:27:03,Dadrobit,Holding yourself parallel to the ground on a sturdy pole?
18-03-2018T20:27:11,Dadrobit,ah
18-03-2018T20:27:26,SpazztasticKiwi,1920‚Äôs
18-03-2018T20:27:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"Apparently, humans have always been stupid"
18-03-2018T20:28:03,Dadrobit,"Yup, Tide Pod Challenge is just the natural evolution of it"
18-03-2018T20:28:22,Bgrmystr2,"if you fall off the flag pole, you could kill yourself"
18-03-2018T20:28:35,Bgrmystr2,"but then again, if the person was stupid enough to climb up the thing to do that"
18-03-2018T20:28:39,Bgrmystr2,dunno
18-03-2018T20:28:45,Bgrmystr2,maybe for the best? :ptv-wondering:
18-03-2018T20:29:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd like to be the person to yell up ‚ÄúGood job; gonna fireman slide down?‚Äù
18-03-2018T20:29:37,Bgrmystr2,the less people trying to do things that would off themselves without offing themselves.. the better

18-03-2018T20:30:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not saying kill the stupid people outright
18-03-2018T20:30:04,Dadrobit,We've been dumb forever.
18-03-2018T20:30:16,Bgrmystr2,xD Dadro
18-03-2018T20:30:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I just say remove the warning labels from some stuff and let the problem take care of itself
18-03-2018T20:31:02,Bgrmystr2,lolo
18-03-2018T20:31:14,Bgrmystr2,I don't think the warning label is the problem
18-03-2018T20:31:23,Bgrmystr2,cuz there's warning labels on tide pods
18-03-2018T20:31:28,Bgrmystr2,cuz that shit's toxic
18-03-2018T20:31:30,Bgrmystr2,people still eat them
18-03-2018T20:31:36,Bgrmystr2,warning label doesn't do shit
18-03-2018T20:31:43,Bgrmystr2,not for the stupids who do it anyway
18-03-2018T20:32:03,Bgrmystr2,warning labels are mostly for preventing kids from doing it who don't actually know better
18-03-2018T20:32:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"It should be understood that it‚Äôs toxic. It‚Äôs laundry soap, but stupid is stupid"
18-03-2018T20:32:20,Bgrmystr2,the adults that know better are gonna do it whether there's a warning or not
18-03-2018T20:32:41,Bgrmystr2,so it's a lost cause for them
18-03-2018T20:33:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"And because lawsuits exist, companies have to warn people not to do dumb stuff like eat soap"
18-03-2018T20:33:29,Bgrmystr2,seems kinda dumb for companies to need to do that but
18-03-2018T20:33:29,SpazztasticKiwi,You can fix ignorance; you can‚Äôt fix stupid

18-03-2018T20:33:38,Dadrobit,that link tho
18-03-2018T20:33:41,Bgrmystr2,yeah our educationis lacking
18-03-2018T20:34:13,Bgrmystr2,haha I like how there's still some ridiculous amount of calls
18-03-2018T20:34:18,Bgrmystr2,and it only went up slightly
18-03-2018T20:34:42,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. 3000 increase when it was 11k is still a large increase but
18-03-2018T20:34:49,Bgrmystr2,the fact that there's 11k to begin with..
18-03-2018T20:34:53,Bgrmystr2,that's sad already
18-03-2018T20:35:04,Dadrobit,"The internet and memes have not made us dumb, it has just made us more aware of how dumb we have always been."
18-03-2018T20:35:07,SpazztasticKiwi,People need to stay in school and actually pay attention
18-03-2018T20:35:47,Bgrmystr2,"you expect school to teach people about that, kiwi"
18-03-2018T20:35:52,Bgrmystr2,but yknow
18-03-2018T20:35:55,Bgrmystr2,xD
18-03-2018T20:35:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll never forget the guy in my class that thought birth control stopped a pregnancy mid-development

18-03-2018T20:36:18,SpazztasticKiwi,The look I gave him was not enough
18-03-2018T20:37:05,Bgrmystr2,"gonna agree, Dadro. the net is great at informing us how stupid we are as a whole"
18-03-2018T20:37:20,Bgrmystr2,but it's also great for influencing those who just follow and don't think for themselves.
18-03-2018T20:37:51,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs a part of the problem
18-03-2018T20:38:47,CrRAR,I learned about the futility of humanity from the internet!

18-03-2018T20:39:27,CrRAR,Can't be too hard.
18-03-2018T20:39:47,Bgrmystr2,"doesn't seem that difficult, considering there's two of them checking for updates for twokinds"
18-03-2018T20:39:51,Bgrmystr2,at least two.
18-03-2018T20:39:57,CrRAR,^ lol
18-03-2018T20:40:05,Dadrobit,brb
18-03-2018T20:40:08,CrRAR,kk
18-03-2018T20:40:11,Bgrmystr2,and one bot that checks for ANY streamer you want on picarto
18-03-2018T20:40:14,Bgrmystr2,plus several other sites
18-03-2018T20:40:22,Bgrmystr2,and there's a bunch of bots like that
18-03-2018T20:40:29,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs bordering on creepy
18-03-2018T20:41:00,CrRAR,accept your botty fate
18-03-2018T20:41:13,Bgrmystr2,"how so, kiwi?"
18-03-2018T20:41:46,unsteddyphoenix,Is it more or less creepy than manually checking the website for updates :thinking:
18-03-2018T20:41:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Watching people pop in and out on online chats
18-03-2018T20:42:13,Bgrmystr2,I don't know what that has to do with a bot checking to see if someone is streaming but
18-03-2018T20:42:14,Bgrmystr2,okay
18-03-2018T20:42:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I know it‚Äôs standard and meant for keeping track of population and regulating everything
18-03-2018T20:42:54,qwe304,well i wont be able to check it 24/7
18-03-2018T20:43:00,SpazztasticKiwi,But have you ever thought about how much you‚Äôre actually watched
18-03-2018T20:43:07,qwe304,but would like to know as soom as anything happens
18-03-2018T20:43:13,Bgrmystr2,I like the fact that I have an addon for firefox that tells me when someone goes live. I go and watch the stream then.
18-03-2018T20:43:35,Bgrmystr2,it's not like it does anything diff from the built-in notification on picarto
18-03-2018T20:43:44,Bgrmystr2,and i'm not really watched lol
18-03-2018T20:43:51,Bgrmystr2,I'm rather boring
18-03-2018T20:44:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I can sit and work for hours in quiet
18-03-2018T20:45:43,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs not necessarily being boring - it‚Äôs being focused
18-03-2018T20:50:35,Bgrmystr2,"lol, uh"
18-03-2018T20:50:39,Bgrmystr2,I don't think that's the same thing
18-03-2018T20:50:55,Bgrmystr2,who is really gonna be watching me? lol
18-03-2018T20:51:10,Bgrmystr2,"other than the NSA, who watches literally everyone"
18-03-2018T21:12:52,TomFursom,How often does he stream?
18-03-2018T21:15:48,Bgrmystr2,the schedule is at the top of the chat

18-03-2018T21:23:50,Bgrmystr2,billboards are fucking monstrous resolution
18-03-2018T21:25:19,CrRAR,tru tru
18-03-2018T21:25:42,Bgrmystr2,you need 7200 by like 10800 or something for a 2x3 foot poster at 300dpi
18-03-2018T21:26:15,TomFursom,I guess I will have to ask on Wednesday
18-03-2018T21:26:15,Bgrmystr2,billboards at the same DPI would have to be like..  aren't they a good 20 foot or something?
18-03-2018T21:26:18,Bgrmystr2,maybe 25foot?
18-03-2018T21:26:20,Bgrmystr2,they're huge

18-03-2018T21:26:58,Kinipshun,no joke
18-03-2018T21:27:49,Bgrmystr2,yeah see
18-03-2018T21:27:52,Bgrmystr2,they're massive
18-03-2018T21:28:31,Bgrmystr2,"A billboard that size would need a resolution of 72,000 x 216,000"
18-03-2018T21:28:33,Bgrmystr2,on 300 dpi
18-03-2018T21:28:43,Bgrmystr2,but I don't think they would need 300 dpi for a billboard
18-03-2018T21:28:52,Bgrmystr2,since it's for the sides of buildings and stuff
18-03-2018T21:29:43,Bgrmystr2,"even at 100dpi, that's still 24,000 x 72,000"
18-03-2018T21:29:45,Bgrmystr2,which is crazy
18-03-2018T21:30:18,CrRAR,"yeah, not that much lol"

18-03-2018T21:32:18,Bgrmystr2,"so yeah, it'd look all pixelated and stuff if you got up close to it haha"
18-03-2018T21:33:03,Vatruvius,It would be ridiculous to manufacture billboards with the same dpi decent monitors or televisions have.

18-03-2018T23:43:41,NightMeaty22,:ptv-kippi2:
18-03-2018T23:44:26,Bgrmystr2,"Night, can you not?"
18-03-2018T23:44:31,Bgrmystr2,"this isn't twitch, you don't need to spam the chat"
18-03-2018T23:44:49,Bgrmystr2,"granted you shouldn't spam the chat there either, but the people there are largely stupid and ignore that"
18-03-2018T23:45:40,NightMeaty22,can you leave me alone
18-03-2018T23:46:20,Bgrmystr2,"public chat, bro"
18-03-2018T23:46:24,Bgrmystr2,:u
18-03-2018T23:46:44,NightMeaty22,yah so i can do what i want
18-03-2018T23:46:56,NightMeaty22,üôÉ
18-03-2018T23:47:50,Bgrmystr2,that means I don't need to leave you alone? :ptv-wondering:
18-03-2018T23:48:23,NightMeaty22,you could block me if you dont want to see spam
18-03-2018T23:48:29,NightMeaty22,idk
18-03-2018T23:48:53,Bgrmystr2,You seem to think that I'm the only one that would have a problem with it.
18-03-2018T23:49:03,Bgrmystr2,"also, that won't solve the problem anyway"
18-03-2018T23:49:38,NightMeaty22,well you are the only one that brings it up so
18-03-2018T23:50:03,Bgrmystr2,"In a chat of 17 people, most of which who are going to be afk sleeping? Thanks, capt obvious."
18-03-2018T23:50:26,Vatruvius,"I would be careful @NightMeaty22, you could get banned from the chart completely. I do not think Tom or the mods would be happy right now."
18-03-2018T23:50:47,Bgrmystr2,Several people have been banned from the chat for spamming
18-03-2018T23:51:20,NightMeaty22,i could just kill my self
18-03-2018T23:51:48,Bgrmystr2,"or just, you know, self restraint? :/"
18-03-2018T23:52:48,Vatruvius,I do not want you to kill yourself but perhaps treat the chat differently. I was really confused as to what you were trying to do earlier. We tend to have some pretty cool conversations here.
18-03-2018T23:53:41,NightMeaty22,sorry this is really the only time i get to talk to people
18-03-2018T23:53:58,NightMeaty22,i'll just go
18-03-2018T23:56:38,Vatruvius,"I am sorry @NightMeaty22, maybe next time there will be more people and a conversation will be going on."
18-03-2018T23:59:11,NightMeaty22,i just have no one to talk to at school because i am an outcast
18-03-2018T23:59:55,Vatruvius,I am sorry to hear that...I have been in that position before.
