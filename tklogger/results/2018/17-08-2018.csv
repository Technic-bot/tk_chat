17-08-2018T00:24:30,Ordithus,"The Kate only one I shared was on your FA, Fluff"
17-08-2018T00:24:45,SageSaga,my height does not define me!
17-08-2018T00:24:59,ZRO4825,"No, but it does determine if you can reach the top shelf without assistance."
17-08-2018T00:25:05,Bgrmystr2,"he says, as his height proceeds to define him"
17-08-2018T00:25:17,Ordithus,"Anyways, Dana, TK is great!  Sage makes Artificial Incident and Yosh!, both fantastic comics"

17-08-2018T00:43:10,SageSaga,i think my net hiccuped
17-08-2018T00:43:20,SageSaga,but the stream didnt drop - just the music
17-08-2018T00:43:30,Bgrmystr2,yeah
17-08-2018T00:43:38,Ordithus,"Wait, there's more!  A one time offer, two comics for the price of one!  If you like AI, why not try Yosh!  Yes, the ! is in the title.  http://yosh.katbox.net/"
17-08-2018T00:43:43,Bgrmystr2,the music is streamed separately I believe
17-08-2018T00:44:17,Bgrmystr2,"or I guess it was at one point, depending on the player? Not sure if that's still a thing now"
17-08-2018T00:44:44,SageSaga,the player was what stopped suddenly
17-08-2018T00:44:52,Bgrmystr2,"I can't get MP4 to work anymore nowadays, it automatically goes back to HLS"
17-08-2018T00:48:06,unsteddyphoenix,"huh, that's weird."
17-08-2018T00:48:10,unsteddyphoenix,"Mine seems fine, personally"
17-08-2018T00:48:19,SageSaga,"yosh folder is 40GBs, AI folder is already 10GBs"

17-08-2018T00:48:37,Ordithus,Higher res?
17-08-2018T00:48:44,unsteddyphoenix,"Im having problems bgr, youre right"
17-08-2018T00:48:45,Ordithus,More layerz?
17-08-2018T00:48:57,unsteddyphoenix,MP4 is super stuttery
17-08-2018T00:48:58,SageSaga,bigger file size - same res
17-08-2018T00:49:05,SageSaga,more detailed images
17-08-2018T00:49:24,Ordithus,Makes sense.  More things = more data
17-08-2018T00:50:11,unsteddyphoenix,more = more
17-08-2018T00:50:33,Ordithus,:ptv-wondering:
17-08-2018T00:54:17,Ordithus,121? comics vs. 2105 though
17-08-2018T00:54:58,SageSaga,large portion of the older Yosh! comics High Res were lost in a hard drive crash
17-08-2018T00:55:12,unsteddyphoenix,D: oh no!
17-08-2018T00:55:13,Ordithus,At this rate... AI will be 174 GB by the time it is as long as Yosh... if it gets that long
17-08-2018T00:55:27,Ordithus,o7
17-08-2018T00:56:17,Bgrmystr2,"averages about 50 pages per gig of Yosh, and 12 pages per gig of AI"
17-08-2018T00:56:39,Bgrmystr2,if that's not telling lol
17-08-2018T00:57:26,Ordithus,Though the two come at different RATES
17-08-2018T00:58:37,Bgrmystr2,yeah
17-08-2018T00:59:35,Ordithus,"So, it works out."
17-08-2018T00:59:58,Ordithus,Math
17-08-2018T01:00:03,DanaTheBabyFox,your comic is very unique though I get sao vibes
17-08-2018T01:00:40,Mihari,^_^;
17-08-2018T01:00:47,SageSaga,it's natural to get vibes of something being like something of the same Genre- i just wish everyone had seen a better LitRPG Isekai than SAO
17-08-2018T01:01:01,unsteddyphoenix,"""isekai"" is the genre right?"
17-08-2018T01:01:05,unsteddyphoenix,"""another world"" genre"
17-08-2018T01:01:14,SageSaga,LitRPG and Isekai
17-08-2018T01:01:26,DanaTheBabyFox,hm?
17-08-2018T01:01:36,SageSaga,"LitRPG is ""RPG Literature"" and Isekai is ""in another world"""
17-08-2018T01:01:51,DanaTheBabyFox,Well my other one a minds eye is by the author of maze runner
17-08-2018T01:01:57,SageSaga,so any story about someone trapped in a game world is both an Isekai and a LitRPG
17-08-2018T01:02:13,SageSaga,while Wizard of Oz is just an Isekai :P
17-08-2018T01:03:17,Ordithus,"I will admit, I enjoyed SAO."
17-08-2018T01:03:34,SageSaga,Shhhhh
17-08-2018T01:03:34,Dadrobit,"See, I just saw ""LitRPG"" and thought, ""Oh man, that RPG must be lit af"""
17-08-2018T01:03:37,SageSaga,dont admit that
17-08-2018T01:03:51,Ordithus,:ptv-confused: I mean.. what?
17-08-2018T01:03:58,Ordithus,:ptv-left:
17-08-2018T01:04:10,Ordithus,Over there!
17-08-2018T01:04:14,Dadrobit,"Mmmmm, this music sounds familiar?"
17-08-2018T01:04:41,SageSaga,"THIS MUSIC IS FROM ""Your Name""!"
17-08-2018T01:05:01,Dadrobit,"Ah, I'm mistaken then. Never seen it, but it's on the list."
17-08-2018T01:05:28,Bgrmystr2,sage plays it regularly so maybe you've heard it from the stream
17-08-2018T01:05:46,Dadrobit,Probably just heard it the back of someone's YT video.
17-08-2018T01:05:56,Bgrmystr2,maybe
17-08-2018T01:06:14,Dadrobit,Also a possibility that I've just heard it enough times here.
17-08-2018T01:06:15,SageSaga,or on the stream
17-08-2018T01:06:21,SageSaga,because it plays every week
17-08-2018T01:06:44,SageSaga,"but now you are going to say ""I never listen to your streams music"""
17-08-2018T01:07:02,Dadrobit,"But to be honest, I rarely have on stream music over my own playlists."
17-08-2018T01:07:11,Dadrobit,:D

17-08-2018T01:07:49,Dadrobit,"Nah, I put all my points into CHA. I'd be the worst Wizard."
17-08-2018T01:08:07,Ordithus,"A fine Warlock, though"
17-08-2018T01:08:07,Dadrobit,I'd just have to try and convince the enemy that I've set them on fire.
17-08-2018T01:08:11,unsteddyphoenix,You'd be surprised how many classes cast with CHA

17-08-2018T01:08:37,Ordithus,"""I've seen this before"""
17-08-2018T01:08:46,unsteddyphoenix,I really need to watch that trash
17-08-2018T01:09:08,SageSaga,Jojo is not trash- Jojo is true art
17-08-2018T01:09:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,jojo is life
17-08-2018T01:09:32,Dadrobit,Haven't played tabletop (besides TCG and stuff like Risk) in over a year now though. feelsbadman.
17-08-2018T01:09:41,unsteddyphoenix,The only anime that's art is that Jaden Smith anime
17-08-2018T01:09:59,Dadrobit,He's Right You Know
17-08-2018T01:10:17,SageSaga,he's a liar
17-08-2018T01:10:48,Dadrobit,"Well, Sage, I guess you don't deserve this giant Toblerone."
17-08-2018T01:10:53,unsteddyphoenix,^^^^^^^^^^^^^
17-08-2018T01:11:07,Dadrobit,InB4Ban
17-08-2018T01:11:11,unsteddyphoenix,Damn I wanna rewatch it now
17-08-2018T01:11:21,SageSaga,"Jaden - ""I wanna make an anime!"" Netflix - ""Convince your dad to do a movie with us"" Jaden - ""Done"" Netflix - ""Ok... please dont ruin us"""
17-08-2018T01:11:48,SageSaga,"i cant have a giant toblerone, i cant eat chocolate"
17-08-2018T01:12:10,unsteddyphoenix,Well clearly that's what not deserving it entails~
17-08-2018T01:12:11,Dadrobit,I'd be willing to bet some amount of money that the infamy of that show alone got them some new subs.
17-08-2018T01:12:28,Dadrobit,Just to see what it was like.
17-08-2018T01:12:39,unsteddyphoenix,"you're referring to Bright, Sage?"
17-08-2018T01:12:45,unsteddyphoenix,Honestly didnt think that was that bad
17-08-2018T01:12:55,Dadrobit,I think that's what he meant.
17-08-2018T01:12:58,SageSaga,"""Hi, i heard hitler was a nazi, so where do i sign up?"" - does it work that way?"
17-08-2018T01:13:09,Dadrobit,Haven't seen it myself actually.
17-08-2018T01:13:25,SageSaga,Bright was alright
17-08-2018T01:13:30,unsteddyphoenix,"""you both cant and dont deserve to be a nazi, because you're jewish"""
17-08-2018T01:13:40,unsteddyphoenix,It's totes how it works~
17-08-2018T01:13:40,SageSaga,i was talking about Jaden Ruining Netflix with his garbage
17-08-2018T01:13:47,Dadrobit,Was... Was that Godwin's Law at work?
17-08-2018T01:14:07,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I debated invoking godwins law there too lol
17-08-2018T01:14:30,Dadrobit,Heck I love the internet
17-08-2018T01:14:32,Ordithus,"I know not of which you speak, and I'm OK with that."
17-08-2018T01:14:52,unsteddyphoenix,There are like 2-3 savants that directed Jadens madness into a genius piece
17-08-2018T01:14:55,unsteddyphoenix,Im convinced
17-08-2018T01:15:15,unsteddyphoenix,Noone can be that unintentionally funny.
17-08-2018T01:15:38,Dadrobit,"Not gonna lie, I laughed so hard and often in the first couple episodes I gave myself a headache."
17-08-2018T01:15:53,SageSaga,that was the tumor it caused
17-08-2018T01:16:07,Dadrobit,Then the last one or two they tried having an actual plot or something that it kinda fell off a bit. Was still good though.
17-08-2018T01:16:18,unsteddyphoenix,When he was sad so he went to lie down on his own grave that he had made in advance.
17-08-2018T01:16:33,Dadrobit,"That damned ""Good thing I brought my vape"" was just brilliant."
17-08-2018T01:16:34,unsteddyphoenix,I had to take a break
17-08-2018T01:17:01,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao
17-08-2018T01:30:59,Dadrobit,Cheerios at 11:30pm. I feel like this is almost too lazy.
17-08-2018T01:31:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Just had waffles
17-08-2018T01:31:45,Dadrobit,"Not even in a bowl, just a big gulp cup."
17-08-2018T01:32:15,Dadrobit,I guess I'm phoning it in for the night on productivity.
17-08-2018T01:32:44,unsteddyphoenix,Nightime cereal is best cereal
17-08-2018T01:33:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,^
17-08-2018T01:33:15,Dadrobit,I'm thinking a bowl might be fun tonight actually.
17-08-2018T01:33:46,unsteddyphoenix,"You mean a bowl of cereal, right? :D"
17-08-2018T01:34:03,Dadrobit,"Don't often light up, but sis's got me a wee bit stressed. That's a good exuse right?"
17-08-2018T01:34:09,Dadrobit,excuse*
17-08-2018T01:34:14,Dadrobit,Unsteddy gets me
17-08-2018T01:34:31,unsteddyphoenix,"Stress is bad, i'll allow it."
17-08-2018T01:34:37,Bgrmystr2,"lol.. I know what you mean dadro, had a friend that did that"
17-08-2018T01:34:43,Bgrmystr2,very often
17-08-2018T01:34:47,Bgrmystr2,kept him calm
17-08-2018T01:35:35,Dadrobit,"Lol. That started to sound like the start of a ""I had a friend who did the weed. He used to inject 3 marijuanas a night!"""
17-08-2018T01:36:01,unsteddyphoenix,"""HE DIED"""
17-08-2018T01:36:30,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds like a wild dude
17-08-2018T01:36:31,Ordithus,It was a gateway... he started doing superdrugs and committing supercrimes
17-08-2018T01:36:43,Dadrobit,I really don't smoke a lot. I pretty much reserve that for grandma and pops. Mostly its just edibles for me.
17-08-2018T01:37:21,Dadrobit,And pops has been leaning more towards vaping as of late as well.
17-08-2018T01:38:10,SpazztasticKiwi,All hail VapePa
17-08-2018T01:38:36,Bgrmystr2,he was just weed
17-08-2018T01:38:38,unsteddyphoenix,he's joined the vapenation
17-08-2018T01:38:48,Bgrmystr2,so nothin scary or whatever
17-08-2018T01:39:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Why’s your sis got you stressed
17-08-2018T01:40:08,DanaTheBabyFox,welp im addicted now
17-08-2018T01:40:17,Dadrobit,Husband is an asshole of word renown.
17-08-2018T01:40:22,Dadrobit,world*
17-08-2018T01:40:46,Bgrmystr2,anyone here in construction?
17-08-2018T01:40:49,Dadrobit,"Divorced him once before even. But got back together after a year so her kids would have a ""complete family"""
17-08-2018T01:40:50,Bgrmystr2,I swear someone was
17-08-2018T01:41:08,unsteddyphoenix,Huh.
17-08-2018T01:41:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Define asshole
17-08-2018T01:41:12,Dadrobit,"Guys is being exceptionally douchey tonight, so she's with me."
17-08-2018T01:41:20,Dadrobit,Guy*
17-08-2018T01:41:23,unsteddyphoenix,It's rare you hear about people divorcing and then remarrying
17-08-2018T01:41:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Dude my ex’s aunt and uncle divorced and remarried like 5 times
17-08-2018T01:42:13,Ordithus,That's gotta be some kind of record
17-08-2018T01:42:14,Dadrobit,"She had a hysterectomy. Can't have sex for a while. She goes home on hard drugs and wakes up in a pool of blood while he claims ""You were asking for it last night""."
17-08-2018T01:42:28,Dadrobit,That kind of asshole.
17-08-2018T01:42:32,Ordithus,Good god
17-08-2018T01:42:43,Dadrobit,The kind that makes you contemplate first degree murder kind of asshole.
17-08-2018T01:42:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Tell him to go to the end of a cliff and jump to a conclusion
17-08-2018T01:43:00,Dadrobit,"But if it's all the same to you, I'd like to drop actually discussing this."
17-08-2018T01:43:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok. I hope she finds some peace
17-08-2018T01:46:35,Dadrobit,Please excuse me while I go roll a fatty. Tranquil Elephantizer is on the menu tonight.
17-08-2018T01:47:06,SageSaga,brb gonna get my dinner
17-08-2018T01:47:33,Ordithus,Get ye to the foods
17-08-2018T01:56:44,SageSaga,back
17-08-2018T01:56:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,WB Sage
17-08-2018T01:57:02,unsteddyphoenix,welcome back~
17-08-2018T01:57:22,SageSaga,man i got unreasonably mad at Ron tonight
17-08-2018T01:58:00,Bgrmystr2,ahh did you? :o
17-08-2018T01:58:06,Bgrmystr2,was there more than we didn't see?
17-08-2018T01:58:12,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering:
17-08-2018T01:58:24,unsteddyphoenix,"I feel like you often get unreasonably mad at him, tbh."
17-08-2018T01:58:24,SageSaga,he tried to say Sea of Thieves was playing 5-D chess and well - that ticked me off
17-08-2018T01:58:45,ZRO4825,Do fuckin what? o.o;
17-08-2018T01:59:00,Ordithus,"That just seems like a harmless, silly thing to say"
17-08-2018T01:59:22,SageSaga,ok he was saying that Sea of Thieves was brilliant for how they did their release- and well
17-08-2018T01:59:40,SageSaga,My mind went right to this -
17-08-2018T01:59:40,unsteddyphoenix,Well that's obviously not true
17-08-2018T02:00:33,unsteddyphoenix,"But it's so absurd that like, how could can one even get mad at that."
17-08-2018T02:00:40,ZRO4825,"I'm pretty sure about the only more untrue statement you could make would be to say ""Final Fantasy XIV's 1.0 launch was fucking amazing."""
17-08-2018T02:00:43,SageSaga,"Sea of Thieves! Releases! A lot of people got the wrong idea, its a sandbox game not a PvP or PvE game- but that wasnt the issue- lots of people knew that- but there were like 3 quests to do over and over and over"
17-08-2018T02:01:26,SageSaga,and you were expected to do that over and over to make progress - but there was no progress- just more of the same
17-08-2018T02:02:09,SageSaga,so the only thing you could do with it at launch to make it worth playing is pretty much Role Play and dont get too bored or else you end up killing your own crew and that never ends well
17-08-2018T02:02:47,Ordithus,k
17-08-2018T02:02:47,SageSaga,so they didnt address this- tons of people left- they slowly rolled out more content- reused a bunch of stuff- and they continued to do that- reuse - rehash
17-08-2018T02:03:47,SageSaga,so the game nearly crashed- the majority of the people still playing are doing so only for the new content and because they couldnt return it  or got it through the Xbox Game Library thing
17-08-2018T02:04:13,SageSaga,"Nothing about any of that is ""Brilliant"""
17-08-2018T02:05:06,SageSaga,"now he tried to argue that they had to do that to get people to test it and its like- we have had that for years- its called a Beta- or even Early access- but no- they sold it for 60 bucks and said it was a full game, and now they are like"
17-08-2018T02:05:10,SageSaga,"""This is the real game!"""
17-08-2018T02:05:30,SageSaga,Oh! Thanks! So you lied to everyone and overcharged everyone! Nice going! Screw you!
17-08-2018T02:05:46,Bgrmystr2,funny.. People used to get paid to test games.. now people pay the company money to test the games..
17-08-2018T02:05:53,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
17-08-2018T02:05:54,Ordithus,The modern world
17-08-2018T02:06:04,Bgrmystr2,"""modern"" lol"
17-08-2018T02:06:16,SageSaga,im fine with that- Early access is fine but you have the option to choose to play in early access
17-08-2018T02:06:30,Ordithus,"Anyways, good you realize you were unreasonable with being angry at Ron."
17-08-2018T02:06:33,SageSaga,"so nothing about what they did was ""Brilliant"" or deserving of praise"
17-08-2018T02:06:44,Ordithus,"As in, this really isn't important XD"
17-08-2018T02:06:58,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah I mean, everything you're saying is correct."
17-08-2018T02:06:59,SageSaga,unreasonably but still reasonable to be upset :P
17-08-2018T02:07:04,unsteddyphoenix,It obviously wasnt a good launch
17-08-2018T02:07:09,Ordithus,"Maybe, slightly upset"
17-08-2018T02:07:11,unsteddyphoenix,It's crazy to say it was
17-08-2018T02:07:28,unsteddyphoenix,But if somoene came up to me convinced that the sky was red I would be more bemused than mad
17-08-2018T02:07:38,SageSaga,i get frustrated when people try to swing obviously bad things to make them seem good
17-08-2018T02:07:54,Ordithus,Seems.... reasonable
17-08-2018T02:08:07,SageSaga,its the same thing everyone keeps saying about Trump- that he only seems bad because hes playing on such a high level we cant even see his moves
17-08-2018T02:08:22,Ordithus,:ptv-grossedout:
17-08-2018T02:08:39,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha I had friends that believed that during the election
17-08-2018T02:08:50,unsteddyphoenix,"""Look! What's he's doing is working, he must be a genius"""
17-08-2018T02:09:01,Ordithus,"""Nope, you're just dumb"""
17-08-2018T02:09:17,SageSaga,"""See? He tweeted about this so that this guy would respond and now hes doing this to get this guy and when hes about ready to strike- he'll back off and be a big hero and THESE guys will come over to our side!"""
17-08-2018T02:10:20,SageSaga,"and every time that falls through ""Everything is still in motion! you wont believe it when it all comes together!"" and im like ""This isnt Jojo, this is politics!"""
17-08-2018T02:10:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you can’t have an adult conversation, don’t try to argue with me on common sense"
17-08-2018T02:11:20,SageSaga,common sense is clearly not a real thing =_=
17-08-2018T02:11:35,Ordithus,"Or the complexities of actual policy, Kiwi!"
17-08-2018T02:11:46,Ordithus,^ Sage
17-08-2018T02:12:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a habit of not arguing with stupid people
17-08-2018T02:12:09,ZRO4825,I do not claim Trump is anything good. Only that he was the better option of the two choices. :x
17-08-2018T02:12:15,SpazztasticKiwi,They’ll drag you down to their level and beat you with experience
17-08-2018T02:13:02,SageSaga,"Zro, you will win no argument with that"
17-08-2018T02:13:52,SageSaga,the only place to go from there is to look at VP and Tim Kane was a pretty good guy- Mike is a monster
17-08-2018T02:14:10,ZRO4825,That's the great thing about opinions. I don't have to win an argument. I just state my opinion and leave it at that. ^_^
17-08-2018T02:14:29,SageSaga,opinions can be bad
17-08-2018T02:14:53,Ordithus,"And no one has to value your opinon, either! :ptv-tease:"
17-08-2018T02:15:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Nice to know how much validation I need to tack on to anything else you say
17-08-2018T02:15:18,ZRO4825,"Can be bad, but if you're not trying to win an argument with'em, they're allowed to be bad. Someone tried to argue with me once that a Geo Storm is a sportscar."
17-08-2018T02:15:29,Ordithus,pfft
17-08-2018T02:15:33,ZRO4825,Exactly.
17-08-2018T02:16:58,Ordithus,"But WHY do you have such an opinion?  Surely you have a reason for it?  Not that I, personally, want to discuss politics at 2 AM"
17-08-2018T02:17:15,Ordithus,"Just, a rhetorical question."
17-08-2018T02:17:21,Ordithus,No need to answer
17-08-2018T02:18:26,ZRO4825,"Basically, I REALLY don't like how Hillary handled Benghazi."
17-08-2018T02:19:10,SageSaga,that all?
17-08-2018T02:19:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"And I don’t like how Trump handles the subject of women, immigrants, other cultures, taxes, human rights, people who disagree with him....do I need to continue?"
17-08-2018T02:19:33,ZRO4825,I don't trust someone who thinks it's okay to throw away lives.
17-08-2018T02:19:37,Ordithus,So... how about Trump and Puerto Rico?
17-08-2018T02:19:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,how about no politics?
17-08-2018T02:19:59,SageSaga,Trump also said we should Nuke people
17-08-2018T02:20:27,sunblaze,"technically he said we should ""use"" nukes. he did not say people"
17-08-2018T02:20:32,sunblaze,but probably meant it yes
17-08-2018T02:20:35,Bgrmystr2,a bit late for that marv xD
17-08-2018T02:20:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,;=;
17-08-2018T02:20:45,ZRO4825,Well it's not like you're gonna use'em for farming.
17-08-2018T02:20:53,unsteddyphoenix,I would trust sage to keep a politics dicussion in line
17-08-2018T02:20:59,unsteddyphoenix,Particularly if he's participating
17-08-2018T02:21:00,SpazztasticKiwi,They shouldn’t be used at all

17-08-2018T02:21:45,ZRO4825,"And I agree with you there, Kiwi. They definitely should never be used."
17-08-2018T02:21:46,Ordithus,"They'd make fantastic fireworks, if it wasn't for the fallout and EMP problems"
17-08-2018T02:22:01,Ordithus,Or the horrible burns
17-08-2018T02:22:08,Ordithus,And death
17-08-2018T02:22:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Disarmament would be nice. World peace would be best. But there’s the issue of pride and ego in the way
17-08-2018T02:22:19,ZRO4825,"But I'm not gonna lie, if someone else is threatening to throw a nuke at me, you can be damned well certain I'm alright with responding in kind."
17-08-2018T02:22:25,Bgrmystr2,"yeah.. unfortunately you need the 1.21 jiggawats to create the nuclear reaction, Ord."
17-08-2018T02:22:33,SageSaga,even if you didnt have to?

17-08-2018T02:23:55,Dadrobit,Back and slightly more chillaxed.
17-08-2018T02:23:58,SageSaga,Does it bother you that Trump wants a military parade?
17-08-2018T02:24:00,Ordithus,wb Robit
17-08-2018T02:24:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"I refuse to continue with this battle of wits, as I see you are unarmed"
17-08-2018T02:24:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,wb Father
17-08-2018T02:24:06,Bgrmystr2,"I think I tried that once, but then got struck with a bolt of lightning and everything bad happened"
17-08-2018T02:24:18,ZRO4825,"To be fair, I also don't keep up with the news. I got tired of seeing bullshit after bullshit. Media's just one skewed story after another. Depending on which media you follow, is how you're gonna get told a story."
17-08-2018T02:24:18,Bgrmystr2,wb dadro
17-08-2018T02:24:37,SageSaga,also you know that North Korea is still saying crap and we gave up a lot of stuff there and they are still doing testing?
17-08-2018T02:24:43,Dadrobit,"Ah, and late to the video game party. But even as someone who heckin' LOVES No Man's Sky now, even I can admit that the launch was rather crap."
17-08-2018T02:24:46,sunblaze,imho the fct that he wants a parade is less a problem then it costs 70 million. money that is not spent on much more viable things
17-08-2018T02:24:58,ZRO4825,wtf kinda parade costs 70 million?
17-08-2018T02:25:03,DanaTheBabyFox,Wtf
17-08-2018T02:25:05,ZRO4825,Are we lining the street in diamonds or something?
17-08-2018T02:25:08,Ordithus,The parade Trump wants to throw
17-08-2018T02:25:13,SageSaga,one involving military hardware
17-08-2018T02:25:13,Ordithus,That is the stated cost
17-08-2018T02:25:27,DanaTheBabyFox,Now im just anooyed AND tired
17-08-2018T02:25:28,Ordithus,They'd probably have to repave a lot of roads...
17-08-2018T02:25:30,Bgrmystr2,"well, the vehicles themselves probably cost that much so I mean.."
17-08-2018T02:25:31,SpazztasticKiwi,A parade designed to stroke a little mans ego
17-08-2018T02:25:32,SageSaga,he wants tanks and missiles paraded around
17-08-2018T02:26:03,SpazztasticKiwi,A power trip
17-08-2018T02:26:05,SageSaga,the USA doesnt need to parade it's military - everyone already knows it's insane
17-08-2018T02:26:24,DanaTheBabyFox,I want more money put in schools
17-08-2018T02:26:34,unsteddyphoenix,Nah you gotta scare those russians

17-08-2018T02:26:45,unsteddyphoenix,Plus he's creating parade-jobs!
17-08-2018T02:26:46,Dadrobit,Fuckin' Commies
17-08-2018T02:26:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Basically Trump wants to take his big truck out and show off the new lift kit
17-08-2018T02:26:48,Bgrmystr2,"I'd like schools to actually function properly before they put more money into it, Dana"

17-08-2018T02:43:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I need to go to bed
17-08-2018T02:44:01,SpazztasticKiwi,But my ear hurt
17-08-2018T02:44:39,FenceEqualizer,"Not quitting just lurking. Also, ear ache?"
17-08-2018T02:44:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Cut ear
17-08-2018T02:45:25,Bgrmystr2,ah floof left
17-08-2018T02:45:28,Bgrmystr2,had to come back
17-08-2018T02:45:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Felt liquid in the ear while sweeping at work. Touch ear. Come back with finger o blood
17-08-2018T02:45:51,FenceEqualizer,"Same, and freaking ow spazz"
17-08-2018T02:46:00,Dadrobit,Cut Ear is an anagram for Curate
17-08-2018T02:46:02,Bgrmystr2,that's really bad kiwi
17-08-2018T02:46:04,Dadrobit,Just sayin'
17-08-2018T02:46:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I cleaned it as soon as I got home. Let peroxide sit on it for a bit
17-08-2018T02:47:14,SpazztasticKiwi,So now it’s mad
17-08-2018T02:48:46,SpazztasticKiwi,But hey according to my schedule I have a nice bit of time off this week. Though $10 says they’re gonna ask me if I can work sometime during that
17-08-2018T02:49:13,FenceEqualizer,"If it's retail, then yes...yes they will"
17-08-2018T02:49:38,Bgrmystr2,"yeah I bet fuckin so. Peroxide burns like a bitch and then some, but it cleans damn good"
17-08-2018T02:51:54,Dadrobit,"""It's retail"" is an anagram for ""Ariel Tits"""
17-08-2018T02:52:14,Dadrobit,Don't know if that means anything. But there it is.
17-08-2018T02:52:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Are you trying to  joke us to death or something
17-08-2018T02:52:37,Dadrobit,"Nah, I just like Scrabble"
17-08-2018T02:52:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"Anagrams are useful, but synonyms are better"
17-08-2018T02:53:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"Synonyms are the difference between “Forgive me Father, for I have sinned” and “Sorry, Daddy, I’ve been naughty”"
17-08-2018T02:54:08,Dadrobit,Boy have I heard that second one before...
17-08-2018T02:54:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d be worried if you had heard the first one
17-08-2018T02:54:35,SpazztasticKiwi,And the second
17-08-2018T02:54:45,SpazztasticKiwi,*then
17-08-2018T02:56:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I must go now my bed needs me 🛌
17-08-2018T02:56:26,Dadrobit,o/
17-08-2018T04:50:04,Chippotatothefirst,... what am I thinking? This is where I go when I wake up in the middle of the night?
17-08-2018T04:50:55,Chippotatothefirst,I just kind of thought about what I was looking at and here the chat was
17-08-2018T04:57:29,Bgrmystr2,Well good morning to you too. :)
17-08-2018T05:01:34,Chippotatothefirst,Hah good morning.
17-08-2018T05:02:19,Chippotatothefirst,Still wondering what I thought I would find in this chat at three in the morning
17-08-2018T05:02:34,Bgrmystr2,us?
17-08-2018T05:02:49,Bgrmystr2,"It's okay Chippo, don't you worry."
17-08-2018T05:02:57,Bgrmystr2,FOR I AM HERE. :ptv-SteelwormHades:
17-08-2018T05:03:04,Chippotatothefirst,Well yeah that was a nice surprise
17-08-2018T05:03:18,Bgrmystr2,and literally noone awake will get that reference
17-08-2018T05:03:30,Bgrmystr2,"or here, rather"
17-08-2018T05:04:01,Chippotatothefirst,I will probably get it in about three months
17-08-2018T05:06:04,Bgrmystr2,unless you're watching a certain series..
17-08-2018T05:06:10,Bgrmystr2,then you may not even get it then
17-08-2018T05:07:33,Chippotatothefirst,What series? Or will I just have to go through archives of shows?
17-08-2018T05:08:31,Bgrmystr2,"Oh, literally first episode of My Hero Academia"
17-08-2018T05:09:18,Chippotatothefirst,Oh... now I have a purpose in being up!
17-08-2018T05:23:48,Chippotatothefirst,"I feel so stupid, I have an app that has almost all anime in it and I just found out that you have to type the names of the shows in Japanese to find them"
17-08-2018T05:44:59,SageSaga,"i got it Bgr, gnight :P"
17-08-2018T05:55:17,Bgrmystr2,"ayy, sage gets it :D"
17-08-2018T05:55:33,Bgrmystr2,"Have a good night, all of my proud goes to you this night."
17-08-2018T11:51:57,Dadrobit,:/ Am a wee bit bored. Running security detail for my parent's open house. But next to no one has shown.
17-08-2018T12:46:02,Dadrobit,"Love y'all, but you're all terrible entertainment sometimes :)"

17-08-2018T14:16:29,Pimsan,"Going to be off topic here, but what do you guys think of Baymax?"
17-08-2018T14:19:52,FoxxTrotter,"Never watched that movie, actually."
17-08-2018T14:20:10,Xexanoth,"Pretty good, so is the series."
17-08-2018T14:20:32,Pimsan,Really? It's a good show and series. And i really like Baymax and his goofyness.

17-08-2018T16:00:08,Bgrmystr2,missed it by a half hour
17-08-2018T16:00:15,Bgrmystr2,was a long night
17-08-2018T16:14:47,CrRAR,s'alright
17-08-2018T16:15:27,CrRAR,there's... more fish... in the streams... or something.
17-08-2018T16:15:40,CrRAR,:fish:
17-08-2018T16:18:59,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering: Um? Okay
17-08-2018T16:19:43,CrRAR,lol
17-08-2018T16:21:01,Ordithus,Don't think about it too much
17-08-2018T16:29:44,SageSaga,yo
17-08-2018T16:30:05,Bgrmystr2,welcome back sage
17-08-2018T16:30:12,Bgrmystr2,I heard you had a monitor die
17-08-2018T16:30:20,Bgrmystr2,the chat told me
17-08-2018T16:30:36,SageSaga,yep  - not sure if it is dead dead but dead enough
17-08-2018T16:30:49,Bgrmystr2,"does it turn on, static, and turn off? :o"
17-08-2018T16:31:52,Bgrmystr2,"I presume no, but that's what happened with mine"
17-08-2018T16:33:15,Bgrmystr2,"also, went through the video recording and there wasn't any distortion that I heard.. or if there was, it wasn't readily apparent."
17-08-2018T16:33:21,SageSaga,it turns on- and says no display signal
17-08-2018T16:33:22,Ordithus,"Time for a new surge protector as well, I presume"
17-08-2018T16:33:47,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, computer doesn't even see it?"
17-08-2018T16:33:49,SageSaga,i replaced it with my older monitor- which has a display port connection - and its working- so the port on the video card is fine
17-08-2018T16:34:11,SageSaga,so im hoping the HDMI cable or the HDMI to Display Port adapter bit it
17-08-2018T16:34:40,Bgrmystr2,do you not have an extra cable to test the other connections?
17-08-2018T16:36:07,SageSaga,kinda
17-08-2018T16:36:27,Bgrmystr2,I think the only cable I'm missing is a displayport cable..
17-08-2018T16:36:35,Bgrmystr2,rest I have
17-08-2018T16:37:50,SageSaga,im just glad the 300+ dollar video card is ok ^^
17-08-2018T16:38:32,Ordithus,"Yeah, that be good"
17-08-2018T16:39:36,Bgrmystr2,when my displays cost almost as much as my GPU did when I got em.. At this point .. :ptv-SteelwormHades:
17-08-2018T16:41:07,SageSaga,the monitor that died was a cheap 1080p 60hz - but it had solid colors
17-08-2018T16:41:16,SageSaga,it was legit 89 dollars
17-08-2018T16:41:27,Bgrmystr2,ahh
17-08-2018T16:41:39,SageSaga,it was terrible for games
17-08-2018T16:41:44,Bgrmystr2,yeah I know 1080p can get super cheap
17-08-2018T16:41:54,Ordithus,"My main monitor was about 115, been using it since 2011"
17-08-2018T16:42:06,SageSaga,but thats why i have this cool 2k monitor with 144hz and 1ms  for gaming
17-08-2018T16:42:19,Ordithus,"I should upgrade.  Also, stream back on! :ptv-excited:"
17-08-2018T16:42:22,Bgrmystr2,"my primary monitor for the longest time is a 27 inch 1080p, but it was $350"
17-08-2018T16:42:29,SageSaga,now- if my Cintiq had died- omg i would be crying
17-08-2018T16:42:52,Bgrmystr2,"I don't care about 1440p or 144hz, so I got the best stats I could get"
17-08-2018T16:42:56,Ordithus,Try not to think about that too much!
17-08-2018T16:43:08,Bgrmystr2,also cuz the 144hz monitors were like $600+ for the same stats
17-08-2018T16:43:13,Bgrmystr2,so big pass
17-08-2018T16:44:50,SageSaga,mine was 340
17-08-2018T16:46:59,SageSaga,144hz is sexy tho - and 2k is ... Free Real estate
17-08-2018T16:47:34,Bgrmystr2,2k would upset the balance I have on my setup anyway so :/
17-08-2018T16:47:53,SageSaga,i use Display fusion to not upset the balance
17-08-2018T16:48:18,Bgrmystr2,I can't make the displays push higher resolutions than they're capable of though
17-08-2018T16:48:43,SageSaga,no one really can?
17-08-2018T16:49:20,Bgrmystr2,"well yeah that's my biggest problem. If I wanna upgrade the resolution of one, I need to do that with all three"
17-08-2018T16:49:35,SageSaga,no you dont
17-08-2018T16:50:15,SageSaga,unless you are trying to do some kinda crazy ultrawide stuff
17-08-2018T16:50:19,Bgrmystr2,"I do, or I can't span my display to 5760x1080"
17-08-2018T16:50:30,Bgrmystr2,and then run racing games spanned across all 3 displays
17-08-2018T16:50:39,Bgrmystr2,cuz they get all super wonky or don't work at all
17-08-2018T16:50:55,SageSaga,yep  - silly ultra wide people
17-08-2018T16:50:58,Bgrmystr2,xD
17-08-2018T16:51:16,Xenotater,Eyy Sage again :P
17-08-2018T16:51:25,Bgrmystr2,"I don't do it too often, but silly stuff like that is an amazing experience if you have the capability to do it"
17-08-2018T16:51:45,Bgrmystr2,so I do it once in a while
17-08-2018T16:51:46,sunblaze,how did it work sage? lighting struck your flat and fried he screen?
17-08-2018T16:52:04,SageSaga,not sure what happened - havent tested the monitor itself but it turns on
17-08-2018T16:52:22,SageSaga,swapped it out with an older monitor i replaced a few months back that was having some minor issues
17-08-2018T16:52:47,Ordithus,"Sounds fancy and fun, bgr"
17-08-2018T16:55:32,Bgrmystr2,"it is, Ord lol"
17-08-2018T16:56:00,SageSaga,the older monitor is a gaming monitor too- so its high end - but the issues made it not good for using as a main anymore
17-08-2018T16:56:24,SageSaga,"using it as my secondary seems fine though because the main point of the secondary monitor is as a ""Status Monitor"""
17-08-2018T16:56:48,SageSaga,i keep OBS there to keep an eye on things- and I put all my chat windows and references on it
17-08-2018T16:57:05,sunblaze,yeah same. still wierd situation
17-08-2018T16:57:30,SageSaga,plus side- if i keep the old monitor there i dont need to have the monitor propped up on a box XD
17-08-2018T16:57:45,SageSaga,it was sitting on my Heat Sink Box - which- was not a small box...
17-08-2018T16:57:50,SageSaga,you could fit a baby in it
17-08-2018T16:58:03,SageSaga,without any mashing
17-08-2018T16:58:21,SageSaga,not that i recommend putting babies in boxes
17-08-2018T16:58:56,SageSaga,also - even in this odd scenario i regret using the term mashing
17-08-2018T16:59:16,sunblaze,:P
17-08-2018T16:59:32,Ordithus,:ptv-confused:
17-08-2018T17:00:43,SageSaga,https://play3r.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Noctua-D15-Install-7.jpg
17-08-2018T17:01:09,SageSaga,im just trying to say the heat sink is huge
17-08-2018T17:01:11,sunblaze,thats kinda overkill.....
17-08-2018T17:01:14,Ordithus,Yeesh
17-08-2018T17:01:21,Bgrmystr2,ooh that's an awesome one
17-08-2018T17:01:24,SageSaga,not on an i7 7700K
17-08-2018T17:01:33,SageSaga,it's NECESSARY
17-08-2018T17:01:50,Bgrmystr2,Noctua seem like they have some really BAD ASS heatsincs
17-08-2018T17:01:53,Bgrmystr2,sinks*
17-08-2018T17:02:05,Bgrmystr2,They sync heat.
17-08-2018T17:02:11,Bgrmystr2,with cold.
17-08-2018T17:02:13,Bgrmystr2,clearly.
17-08-2018T17:02:13,SageSaga,their air coolers are top of the line
17-08-2018T17:02:36,SageSaga,the i7 7700k runs very very hot
17-08-2018T17:02:48,Bgrmystr2,"that's what I plan to get when I upgrade my processor, a Noctua. Some of their coolers actually rival temps for full liquid cooling systems."
17-08-2018T17:02:52,Bgrmystr2,which is amazing
17-08-2018T17:02:58,SageSaga,mine almost fried when i was running a closed loop cooler on it
17-08-2018T17:03:19,Ordithus,Good heat pipes and lots of air work wonders
17-08-2018T17:03:28,SageSaga,this thing keeps it at under 40c at normal use and under 70c on heavy gaming
17-08-2018T17:03:56,SageSaga,also - whisper quiet
17-08-2018T17:04:00,sunblaze,ha I run at 55/80 and working :D
17-08-2018T17:04:03,Bgrmystr2,"Sage, If you were to get a more recent CPU, do you think you'd go AMD or Intel? With like,, the Ryzen / threadripper vs intels new line"
17-08-2018T17:04:07,Bgrmystr2,jus curious
17-08-2018T17:04:27,Bgrmystr2,presuming cost wasn't a factor at all
17-08-2018T17:04:38,SageSaga,its really really tough- if i could afford a threadripper- i probably would try it XD
17-08-2018T17:04:52,Bgrmystr2,xD
17-08-2018T17:04:53,SageSaga,but even then - if cost wasnt a factor- uhhhhhhggggggggggg
17-08-2018T17:04:57,SageSaga,probably still intel
17-08-2018T17:05:01,Bgrmystr2,hmm
17-08-2018T17:05:20,SageSaga,they just work with everything i do slightly better
17-08-2018T17:05:31,Bgrmystr2,Yeah that makes sense
17-08-2018T17:05:38,SageSaga,but like for a server application - i think the thread ripper is waaaay better
17-08-2018T17:05:51,SageSaga,all those cores and threads are so sexy
17-08-2018T17:05:58,Bgrmystr2,yeah
17-08-2018T17:06:04,Bgrmystr2,fair enough
17-08-2018T17:06:13,Ordithus,Though if you don't often use all those cores...
17-08-2018T17:06:18,Ordithus,A bit of a waste
17-08-2018T17:06:26,SageSaga,that is why i said for a server application
17-08-2018T17:06:47,Ordithus,Most things you do probably tax GPU more than a many-many-threaded CPU
17-08-2018T17:06:48,SageSaga,intel still does single core processes better and most games are still single or dual core only
17-08-2018T17:06:58,Bgrmystr2,"I'm debating on what to get when I upgrade my cpu. I don't think I'll need threadripper or anything, but I know I want somethin that'll let me stream to multiple places at once and render videos fairly well"
17-08-2018T17:07:05,Ordithus,Now if you were doing CFD...
17-08-2018T17:07:17,SageSaga,here's the big issue Bgr
17-08-2018T17:07:31,SageSaga,the Ryzen 7 is what i would say is the best for that- i think- but-
17-08-2018T17:07:58,SageSaga,their prices at the Ryzen7 isnt as competitive as the Ryzen5s vs intel
17-08-2018T17:08:10,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
17-08-2018T17:08:20,SageSaga,so you will see i7's near or even at the same price as a Ryzen7
17-08-2018T17:08:32,ZoieFalcona,*peeks back in*
17-08-2018T17:08:38,SageSaga,howdy Zoie
17-08-2018T17:08:45,ZoieFalcona,"Hey there, Sage :)"
17-08-2018T17:08:46,Ordithus,I might build a fully new system next year
17-08-2018T17:08:49,FoxxTrotter,"Hey, Zoie."
17-08-2018T17:08:54,ZoieFalcona,Hi Foxx
17-08-2018T17:09:53,SageSaga,big Nvidia announcement Monday
17-08-2018T17:10:03,SageSaga,probably already spoiled but not confirmed by now XD
17-08-2018T17:10:11,ZoieFalcona,oh?!
17-08-2018T17:10:12,sunblaze,we will reaise preices 20% enjoy fans :D
17-08-2018T17:10:13,Bgrmystr2,what do ppl think it is?
17-08-2018T17:10:18,Bgrmystr2,xD Sun
17-08-2018T17:10:26,Bgrmystr2,I think that's more intel's thing
17-08-2018T17:10:29,Bgrmystr2,but yknow
17-08-2018T17:10:32,SageSaga,RTX 2080
17-08-2018T17:10:43,Bgrmystr2,a new GPU line?
17-08-2018T17:10:46,SageSaga,yep
17-08-2018T17:10:54,SageSaga,not GTX - RTX - for Ray Tracing
17-08-2018T17:11:55,Bgrmystr2,not sure the difference between GTX and RTX is
17-08-2018T17:11:58,Bgrmystr2,:(
17-08-2018T17:12:19,Bgrmystr2,I don't know too much about that level of depth in graphics cards
17-08-2018T17:12:21,Ordithus,The letter R is clearly cooler than G
17-08-2018T17:12:28,Bgrmystr2,I'd question that Ord
17-08-2018T17:12:37,Bgrmystr2,xD
17-08-2018T17:12:45,Bgrmystr2,"but that's of course, up to interpretation"
17-08-2018T17:13:05,ZoieFalcona,But... it shall never be cooler than C
17-08-2018T17:13:11,Ordithus,"It's the Honda Civic Type R, not type G!"
17-08-2018T17:13:15,Bgrmystr2,CTX?
17-08-2018T17:13:24,Bgrmystr2,Sounds like it's short for Cortex
17-08-2018T17:13:33,Bgrmystr2,and that'd be a cool name for a card line
17-08-2018T17:13:44,SageSaga,look up on youtube what ray tracing is
17-08-2018T17:13:55,SageSaga,i wonder if Tech Quickie talked about it
17-08-2018T17:14:12,Ordithus,The goal of real-time lighting for the past 20+ years?
17-08-2018T17:16:55,Bgrmystr2,so.. is the point of the RTX cards trying to have a card fast enough to use ray tracing for gaming?
17-08-2018T17:17:06,Bgrmystr2,or at least fast processes like games
17-08-2018T17:17:19,Bgrmystr2,which need a lot of visual data very quickly
17-08-2018T17:17:24,happyguyone,sup
17-08-2018T17:17:31,Bgrmystr2,"in real time, even"
17-08-2018T17:17:35,Bgrmystr2,hey happyguy
17-08-2018T17:17:57,SageSaga,Bgr- yes
17-08-2018T17:18:23,SageSaga,now - we  dont know how successful it has been- but we should have more details- Monday
17-08-2018T17:18:23,Bgrmystr2,sounds good
17-08-2018T17:18:58,Bgrmystr2,I won't be getting a new pc before monday so.. I should be well-versed in whether RTX will actually be what I want by the time I can afford one lol
17-08-2018T17:19:05,Bgrmystr2,or perhaps even before.
17-08-2018T17:21:13,Bgrmystr2,"from what I'm reading, seems like a yes though."
17-08-2018T17:31:08,Ordithus,This page is looking really good
17-08-2018T17:33:09,Bgrmystr2,indeed
17-08-2018T17:34:53,Ordithus,"Specifically, Kaylin in the third panel.  Well done"
17-08-2018T17:36:30,SageSaga,ty
17-08-2018T17:36:36,SageSaga,i think its done now
17-08-2018T17:37:10,FoxxTrotter,Great work. :0)
17-08-2018T17:37:11,Bgrmystr2,I kinda miss the subtle blush in the 2nd panel
17-08-2018T17:37:15,Bgrmystr2,from the sketch
17-08-2018T17:37:35,Bgrmystr2,but it looks nice
17-08-2018T17:37:42,Bgrmystr2,more LORE incoming :D
17-08-2018T17:38:27,SageSaga,there's no blush in that panel-
17-08-2018T17:38:35,Bgrmystr2,ehh
17-08-2018T17:38:41,Bgrmystr2,maybe it was a different panel
17-08-2018T17:38:43,Ordithus,The exposition will go on
17-08-2018T17:38:47,Bgrmystr2,I'm all discombobulated now D:
17-08-2018T17:39:36,Bgrmystr2,"I swear there was, or used to be.. I"
17-08-2018T17:39:41,Bgrmystr2,I'll* have to go back and loo
17-08-2018T17:39:46,Bgrmystr2,look* jkaslhf
17-08-2018T17:40:25,Bgrmystr2,hmm
17-08-2018T17:40:43,Bgrmystr2,wonder what I remember then :thinking:
17-08-2018T17:41:35,Bgrmystr2,"Anycase, lookin forward to this page as always :thumbsup:"
17-08-2018T17:41:43,Bgrmystr2,"gotta run for now, birthday party goin on here, not mine tho"

17-08-2018T17:41:47,SageSaga,and the next one
17-08-2018T17:41:50,SageSaga,and the one after that
17-08-2018T17:41:59,Bgrmystr2,xD Always.
17-08-2018T17:41:59,Ordithus,And the one after that one!
17-08-2018T17:42:06,FoxxTrotter,"C-ya, Bgr."
17-08-2018T17:42:07,SageSaga,not so much the climax of the next chapter
17-08-2018T17:42:12,Ordithus,"But then, it's the end.  Kaylin dies."
17-08-2018T17:42:13,SageSaga,because thats gonna be hard to draw-
17-08-2018T17:42:47,SageSaga,peace folks! thanks for joining
17-08-2018T17:43:00,Ordithus,Thanks for streaming!  Hopefully the monitor lives
17-08-2018T17:43:05,FoxxTrotter,"Thanks for the stream, Sage. Enjoy the rest of your weekend. :0)"
17-08-2018T17:43:16,FoxxTrotter,"Later, everyone."
17-08-2018T17:44:35,Bgrmystr2,thanks for streamin sage

17-08-2018T19:53:21,Bigboi182,Hi guys
17-08-2018T19:54:32,butidontwantto,sup
17-08-2018T19:54:59,Bigboi182,"Everyone's just not talking, huh?"
17-08-2018T20:25:14,Bgrmystr2,yeh it's pretty quiet sat nights
17-08-2018T22:20:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I want the cookie dough ice cream but I don’t need it
