19-04-2018T00:52:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,remember the time he broke carvers barrier
19-04-2018T00:53:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Carver who I might add might have been the only one who could have made my ship reality so........ damn it Zen
19-04-2018T00:55:49,TheBeckoner,Im tired...Gonna go to bed peeps. See y'all in the stream tomorrow

19-04-2018T01:09:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom, you got the chapter storyline written out already right?"
19-04-2018T01:09:39,Dadrobit,"Blah, only got a 90% on my test tonight. Missed a question on tax law influencing donations to non-profits."
19-04-2018T01:09:48,Twokinds,ya
19-04-2018T01:09:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Cool
19-04-2018T01:10:08,SpazztasticKiwi,At least it‚Äôs an A
19-04-2018T01:10:34,Dadrobit,I think it's outdated info though.
19-04-2018T01:10:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Very likely
19-04-2018T01:11:13,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs some textbooks I‚Äôve come across that still how old thinking in them too
19-04-2018T01:11:16,Dadrobit,Because a few years back some stuff changed and donations are reported to have quadrupled.
19-04-2018T01:11:21,SpazztasticKiwi,*have
19-04-2018T01:11:38,Dadrobit,But all my lectures are from around 2006.
19-04-2018T01:11:44,Dadrobit,to 2009
19-04-2018T01:12:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"My CPR class taught most of the more modern stuff though, so that was notable"
19-04-2018T01:12:14,Dadrobit,Gonna have to send an email to the professor about it.
19-04-2018T01:12:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Hopefully I‚Äôm never in the situation that I have to help deliver an emergency baby though
19-04-2018T01:14:03,Dadrobit,My CPR certification through Red Cross is about to expire actually now that I look at it.
19-04-2018T01:14:54,Dadrobit,Got a few months left. 9/15/18
19-04-2018T01:15:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"I was offered certification, but decided I would rather have all the knowledge and ability without the card saying I‚Äôm legally obligated/responsible in an emergency situation"
19-04-2018T01:16:41,Dadrobit,First got taught in the Boy Scouts. Then it was mandatory to be certified and carry the license at all times back when I was a Security Professional.
19-04-2018T01:17:37,Twokinds,"I used to be a certified first responder, but it's certainly expired by now."
19-04-2018T01:18:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel the weird part of the emergency birth situation was what the said to do with the father if he was present
19-04-2018T01:18:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"Get recertified, maybe ?"
19-04-2018T01:18:35,Twokinds,But that's woooork
19-04-2018T01:18:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Good point
19-04-2018T01:19:10,Twokinds,I only got certified in the first place because it was part of medical school
19-04-2018T01:19:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Makes sense. Gotta know the little stuff with the big stuff
19-04-2018T01:19:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I was interested in being a doctor for a short while
19-04-2018T01:20:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"Blood and gore did nothing to me, but I just decided it wasn‚Äôt a big interest for me"
19-04-2018T01:21:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"Plus, I‚Äôd have to deal with people"

19-04-2018T02:31:11,DarthRexKing,I am going too. No point in wasting sleep when stream is done over simple chitchat.
19-04-2018T02:31:51,Twokinds,You're right! Time to stream again!
19-04-2018T02:32:40,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-natsducky:

19-04-2018T02:38:57,Dadrobit,"Also, yes, I enjoy writing."
19-04-2018T02:39:02,unsteddyphoenix,ahh.
19-04-2018T02:39:15,Dadrobit,And even drawing a few times a week as I can force myself.
19-04-2018T02:39:37,unsteddyphoenix,"Mm, same."
19-04-2018T02:40:02,Dadrobit,Have been forcing myself to have better penmanship lately.
19-04-2018T02:40:09,Bgrmystr2,Sorry had to drop out. Was gonna do the thing Dadro suggested but right after the stream ended I was bugged to do money stuff for house hunting.. :face_palm:
19-04-2018T02:40:21,unsteddyphoenix,Cursive?
19-04-2018T02:40:29,unsteddyphoenix,Oh you lookin' for a house?
19-04-2018T02:40:30,Dadrobit,"Nah, not even cursive."

19-04-2018T02:41:01,unsteddyphoenix,aw. I like the little gifs of people wiring cursive
19-04-2018T02:41:03,Bgrmystr2,not workin* even..
19-04-2018T02:41:06,unsteddyphoenix,Very satisfying
19-04-2018T02:41:18,unsteddyphoenix,ahh I see
19-04-2018T02:41:21,Dadrobit,"But I got into a bad habit of taking so many notes so fast in certain classes, that my words became my own special brand of shorthand."
19-04-2018T02:41:31,Bgrmystr2,"I say this, they do the opposite, I suggest that, they don't do that thing."
19-04-2018T02:41:39,Dadrobit,To the point that even I couldn't understand some of it at times.
19-04-2018T02:42:07,Bgrmystr2,"and now they're stuck with a program that will cost them more money per month and they just go ""whatever"" :/"
19-04-2018T02:43:08,Bgrmystr2,I tried.

19-04-2018T02:44:23,unsteddyphoenix,Like the slides or w/e?
19-04-2018T02:44:45,Bgrmystr2,I get cramps after like 30-45 mins.. and I can't even grip a cup
19-04-2018T02:46:39,Dadrobit,The only slides I have access to are the ones from my single copyright law class.
19-04-2018T02:46:51,Dadrobit,Everyone else is all whiteboard and spoken word.
19-04-2018T02:47:06,unsteddyphoenix,gross
19-04-2018T02:47:14,unsteddyphoenix,I  would struggle
19-04-2018T02:48:18,Dadrobit,A lot of people did in one of my classes. Digital Audio Workstations 2. The professor was an absolute taskmaster about taking thorough notes and keeping up with him.
19-04-2018T02:48:37,Dadrobit,I went through two and a half notebooks on that class alone.
19-04-2018T02:49:31,Dadrobit,"And if he caught you slacking on the notetaking, he had no qualms about calling students out for it right then and there."
19-04-2018T02:50:14,Dadrobit,I actually got along pretty well with the dude though.
19-04-2018T02:50:58,Dadrobit,"As long as you can roll with the punches and jab back, he was a totally cool cat."
19-04-2018T02:51:00,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
19-04-2018T02:51:21,Dadrobit,But a lot of folks just kinda rolled over and died.
19-04-2018T02:51:23,unsteddyphoenix,"Idk, at uni level at some point you just gotta let the kids fail"
19-04-2018T02:51:33,unsteddyphoenix,Instead of that aggressive handholding
19-04-2018T02:52:01,unsteddyphoenix,I never figured out how to retain information and take notes honestly
19-04-2018T02:52:05,Dadrobit,"That was his deal. If you can't handle some stress in a classroom, you're not gonna make it in a real studio."
19-04-2018T02:53:04,Dadrobit,I only really learned just a few semesters ago honestly.
19-04-2018T02:53:48,Dadrobit,Just because I really love the subject matter and it kinda forced me to take comprehensive notes and draw diagrams and stuff.
19-04-2018T02:54:28,Dadrobit,I dunno if I'd be able to go back to a class like Calc and take as good notes honestly.
19-04-2018T02:54:44,Dadrobit,It's just my interest in the field.
19-04-2018T02:55:28,unsteddyphoenix,True interest is critical
19-04-2018T02:56:50,Dadrobit,"Yup, that and a healthy dose of ""reality""."
19-04-2018T02:57:27,Dadrobit,"I don't want to fail, I've had enough of that..."
19-04-2018T02:58:29,Dadrobit,No scholarships or grants anymore. My education is all out of pocket. I had to earn straight up money to go back.
19-04-2018T02:58:46,Dadrobit,So there's tangible value there that I understand.
19-04-2018T02:59:52,unsteddyphoenix,Couldn't get a loan?
19-04-2018T03:01:08,Dadrobit,No debt. I refuse.
19-04-2018T03:02:12,Dadrobit,Don't want to be paying money back for the rest of my life for a piece of paper.
19-04-2018T03:03:21,unsteddyphoenix,That's a good call~
19-04-2018T03:09:32,unsteddyphoenix,thats what i'll be doing :ptv-dealwithit:

19-04-2018T13:54:26,Dadrobit,Just got home from breakfast with grandma since I couldn't visit her last night.
19-04-2018T13:54:43,Dadrobit,Because ~Someone~ just had to do a suprise stream....
19-04-2018T13:55:15,Dadrobit,But it was a nice breakfast. :)
19-04-2018T13:57:22,SilliconeCarbide,must have been a captivating stream
19-04-2018T14:04:54,Twokinds,lol sorry
19-04-2018T14:05:55,CatzArt,it was
19-04-2018T14:07:34,Dadrobit,"Well, it was that and finishing up an essay lol."
19-04-2018T14:08:22,CatzArt,yep spring semester is nearly done here at OSU. Makes college students busy busy busy
19-04-2018T14:10:10,Dadrobit,Students be like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rTa6HMi3R4
19-04-2018T14:14:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I almost forgot to pick up my sister after work and started home
19-04-2018T14:17:45,TheDixieNutjob,O.o
19-04-2018T14:30:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I gotta party to be at in two hours
19-04-2018T14:42:16,TheDixieNutjob,this new tablet of mine is gonna take some getting used to
19-04-2018T14:42:45,Twokinds,which tablet is that
19-04-2018T14:46:17,TheDixieNutjob,the Huion H610
19-04-2018T14:46:37,TheDixieNutjob,from my trusty Wacom Bamboo that I had for 6 years
19-04-2018T14:47:37,TheDixieNutjob,and that I ruined the out of production stylus because of Microsoft's royal failing that I wasn't aware of until it was too late
19-04-2018T14:48:19,Twokinds,"Oh, cool"
19-04-2018T14:48:29,Twokinds,I've wondered how the Huions did.
19-04-2018T14:49:28,TheDixieNutjob,so far so good. the reviews for it say it's the best alternative to the Wacom Intuos Pro. I found it on Amazon for $70
19-04-2018T14:49:29,Dadrobit,Heard mixed things about Huion. Lotta people ejoy it as a less expensive but functional option. But I've also heard that there are quality issues.
19-04-2018T14:49:42,TheDixieNutjob,this model at least
19-04-2018T14:51:13,Dadrobit,"$70? That's a steal, those are around $200 usually no?"
19-04-2018T14:51:23,TheDixieNutjob,no that's the Intuos
19-04-2018T14:51:35,TheDixieNutjob,*Pro
19-04-2018T14:51:50,TheDixieNutjob,forgot there are 2 different Wacom Intuos models
19-04-2018T14:52:31,Dadrobit,Ahh
19-04-2018T14:53:06,TheDixieNutjob,and the free shipping is a bonus because I suckered Amazon Prime with the 30 free trial that I never used until now mwahahahahahaaaa
19-04-2018T15:01:45,Kiit0s,"Huion is great, I had the 1060 model before my Intuos Pro M and it was very good."
19-04-2018T15:02:25,Kiit0s,"Apparently another competitor out there now is XP Pen, they seem on par with Huion"
19-04-2018T15:10:42,Dadrobit,Time to clean up the computer methinks. The target ads are getting to know me too well.
19-04-2018T15:18:11,Dadrobit,"While that's doing, I'm gonna head out for a bit, have a good one y'all."
19-04-2018T15:18:18,TheDixieNutjob,indeed
19-04-2018T16:06:59,SpazztasticKiwi,So I went to rent Star Wars today
19-04-2018T16:10:19,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
19-04-2018T16:12:20,SpazztasticKiwi,It was checked out
19-04-2018T16:17:53,Twokinds,Aw
19-04-2018T16:18:00,Twokinds,You're just not having any luck today XD
19-04-2018T16:18:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Evidently not. But I may still get that dress
19-04-2018T16:20:00,SpazztasticKiwi,And I‚Äôll have ice cream soon
19-04-2018T16:22:07,SpazztasticKiwi,What are you doing
19-04-2018T16:23:02,Twokinds,Wasting my day browsing reddit
19-04-2018T16:23:16,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering: again
19-04-2018T16:23:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôve never gotten into reddit. I know there‚Äôs cool stuff, but I‚Äôve most often seen and heard of the weird"
19-04-2018T16:31:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Seems my luck has kinda been fizzy since yesterday
19-04-2018T16:53:56,Xexanoth,"maybe you're cursed, try getting blessed and see if that fixes it"
19-04-2018T17:25:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw a bubblegum pink truck with floral decals
19-04-2018T17:25:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Is that a sign of good fortune or more weirdness
19-04-2018T17:34:58,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
19-04-2018T17:35:03,Bgrmystr2,bit of both
19-04-2018T18:18:40,Dadrobit,Just got back from the Black Panther movie. Pretty solid for the most part.
19-04-2018T18:25:00,Twokinds,"Yeah I've heard a number of people describe it as a ""solid"" movie."
19-04-2018T18:25:06,Twokinds,I haven't seen it yet.
19-04-2018T18:25:23,Bgrmystr2,I would question whether movies can be liquids
19-04-2018T18:25:35,Bgrmystr2,if some are solid
19-04-2018T18:28:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Have you seen Coco?
19-04-2018T18:28:56,Twokinds,Nope
19-04-2018T18:32:09,CrRAR,"Very touching movie, meanders a bit but it gets the point across."
19-04-2018T18:33:26,CrRAR,Very few movies are groundbreaking there days~
19-04-2018T18:33:34,CrRAR,*these
19-04-2018T18:34:42,Xexanoth,"Well, at this point you can mostly be groundbreaking with new technology, because story wise most stuff has been done"
19-04-2018T18:35:13,Keeeef,Hi
19-04-2018T18:35:38,CrRAR,hi
19-04-2018T18:35:52,CrRAR,yeah... just every once and a while~
19-04-2018T18:36:16,Keeeef,It's an hour and a half till the stream right?
19-04-2018T18:36:23,Dadrobit,I'm afraid to see Coco. I hate going into movies knowing I'm gonna be sad by the end...
19-04-2018T18:36:43,Keeeef,Coco ain't sad
19-04-2018T18:36:49,CrRAR,it's pretty upbeat for a movie about death-land XD
19-04-2018T18:37:14,CrRAR,yeah
19-04-2018T18:37:29,Keeeef,You only sad if you think about the squatters
19-04-2018T18:37:51,Keeeef,Soz for spoilers
19-04-2018T18:38:30,Xexanoth,can't spoil if noone knows what that is in terms of the movie
19-04-2018T18:38:42,CrRAR,"It's better than The Good Dinosaur, if that means anything... I loved the environment work in that but wow the story was lame ."
19-04-2018T18:38:50,Dadrobit,Never saw that one.
19-04-2018T18:39:07,CrRAR,It was like a Pixar Short that ran wayyyy too long.
19-04-2018T18:39:11,CrRAR,XD
19-04-2018T18:39:30,CrRAR,"It's just like... ""Is this the movie... or what?"""
19-04-2018T18:39:52,Dadrobit,No depth to the story?
19-04-2018T18:39:55,Xexanoth,"well, there's a reason it didn't do to well"
19-04-2018T18:40:02,CrRAR,THEN the neanderthal kid shows up

19-04-2018T18:40:52,CrRAR,"oh, it is"

19-04-2018T20:16:19,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: not a lot of pizza places do the 30+ mins and it's free
19-04-2018T20:16:52,Bgrmystr2,it was probably a thing that happened and then stopped pretty quickly cuz you can't guarantee it
19-04-2018T20:17:13,Bgrmystr2,people would call from over 40mins away just to get free pizza or whatnot

19-04-2018T22:34:22,SageSaga,"im not even sure if Aptitude is real, it could just be as your mind developed you just developed a certain type of perception that helps you- its not something people just have- it is still learned"

19-04-2018T22:35:10,Justanotheruser7118,Actually this was discussed at my class one day.
19-04-2018T22:35:23,Issus,"I don't have any reason to believe that, just like people can be physically different in ways and thus better at some things, that mentally it would be the same case."
19-04-2018T22:35:29,Keeeef,why
19-04-2018T22:35:37,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-keith8D:
19-04-2018T22:35:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,@TheBeckoner Zen is trying to figure out if he's a uncle or needs to pay child support

19-04-2018T22:35:52,CrRAR,haha marv
19-04-2018T22:35:52,unsteddyphoenix,"Well the ""doing it without trying"" just probably also is just related to aptitude. It looks like they dont have to try, but they just picked it up and understood it instantly."
19-04-2018T22:35:57,Issus,"wouldn't* I guess, since it's hard to fit a thought into a tiny text box."
19-04-2018T22:35:59,TheBeckoner,Both is possible Marv.
19-04-2018T22:36:01,unsteddyphoenix,So it's perceived that way
19-04-2018T22:36:04,bacon683,I think zen is celebrating 4/20
