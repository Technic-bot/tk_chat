29-03-2018T00:00:34,Vatruvius,Of all places for an Irishman...he chooses Atlanta? He is Irish right?
29-03-2018T00:01:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah. This is the American stretch of the tour
29-03-2018T00:01:33,SpazztasticKiwi,He did a show in Orlando today
29-03-2018T00:01:42,Vatruvius,Well have fun...I am not a Jack fan but he certainly has the fan base.
29-03-2018T00:02:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I will have the most I can
29-03-2018T00:02:43,SpazztasticKiwi,My poor Twitter followers are gonna see a lot of it tomorrow
29-03-2018T00:02:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Granted most are mutual fans
29-03-2018T00:02:58,Vatruvius,Do you know where you are sitting? Are there even seats? Is it first come first serve?
29-03-2018T00:03:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"VIP, front row"
29-03-2018T00:03:20,Vatruvius,Nice.
29-03-2018T00:03:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I stalked the ticket sales
29-03-2018T00:04:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"We get in an hour early, get a signed poster, and get to do a q&a with Seán"
29-03-2018T00:04:31,Dadrobit,back
29-03-2018T00:04:39,SpazztasticKiwi,front
29-03-2018T00:05:07,Vatruvius,I personally would love to attend an Acquisition Incorporated event front row. Thing is...I lack funds and have never been. I would need a friend to go with me because it would also be my first PAX.
29-03-2018T00:05:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I know the feeling. Only reason I’m going to East is because I kinda roped a friend into it too
29-03-2018T00:05:58,Vatruvius,lol
29-03-2018T00:06:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"After tomorrow, I’ll have seen Seán, Bob, Wade, Mark, and Ethan in real life"
29-03-2018T00:06:56,SpazztasticKiwi,And Tyler
29-03-2018T00:07:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"But Wade, Bob, and Tyler aren’t going to Easy"
29-03-2018T00:07:23,SpazztasticKiwi,*East
29-03-2018T00:07:25,Dadrobit,"Ayyy, first Comic Con I went to was just from me, InfiniteEdge, and Johnny spitballing ""Wouldn't it be fun if we all went tomorrow together?"""
29-03-2018T00:07:28,Dadrobit,So we did
29-03-2018T00:07:37,Dadrobit,Literally the niht before
29-03-2018T00:07:40,Dadrobit,night*
29-03-2018T00:07:54,Vatruvius,OMG
29-03-2018T00:07:58,Vatruvius,lol
29-03-2018T00:08:04,unsteddyphoenix,lol cute~
29-03-2018T00:08:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I hope to get my You’re Welcome tour shirt signed at East
29-03-2018T00:08:53,Dadrobit,"W0lf wanted to come and share in the ultra quesadillas with us, but he lives in like... Canada I think."
29-03-2018T00:09:02,SpazztasticKiwi,But only Mark and Ethan will be there
29-03-2018T00:09:28,Vatruvius,Well...you could get a calendar.
29-03-2018T00:09:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Nope™️
29-03-2018T00:09:36,Vatruvius,Signed and all.
29-03-2018T00:09:42,Vatruvius,lol
29-03-2018T00:10:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Not my cup of tea
29-03-2018T00:10:07,Dadrobit,Nopeᵀᴹ
29-03-2018T00:10:11,Dadrobit,Fixed it for ya
29-03-2018T00:10:27,Dadrobit,#QualityTrademarkᵀᴹ
29-03-2018T00:10:28,Vatruvius,Imagine if you were to just...slip that calendar into a coworkers locker or something.
29-03-2018T00:11:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d get fired for soliciting explicit or unprofessional material
29-03-2018T00:11:17,Vatruvius,Work is no fun...come on...agh.
29-03-2018T00:11:47,Bigboi182,Hey!
29-03-2018T00:11:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m torn because it’s for charity but I’m not crazy about what I’m getting for it
29-03-2018T00:12:05,Vatruvius,I think it would be a good prank on a friend who is in a relationship...just come over one day and pin that calendar up.
29-03-2018T00:12:10,Bigboi182,Did WIPKING get banned in anyway?
29-03-2018T00:12:27,SpazztasticKiwi,No clue
29-03-2018T00:12:38,SpazztasticKiwi,He kinda just disappeared
29-03-2018T00:12:39,Dadrobit,Reminds me of a security officer that got fired at my post for having nudes of his BF on his phone.
29-03-2018T00:12:48,Bigboi182,Because you ignored him didn't you?
29-03-2018T00:12:52,Vatruvius,Really?
29-03-2018T00:13:10,Vatruvius,I have not seen WIPKING all night Bigboi.
29-03-2018T00:13:18,Dadrobit,His assistant officer went looking through the guy's phone while it was unattended and reported the nudes.
29-03-2018T00:13:40,Vatruvius,That is shit...and he clearly wanted dirt to get his position.
29-03-2018T00:13:45,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s a breach of someone else’s property
29-03-2018T00:13:46,Dadrobit,"Even though the guy wasn't actively oogling them on the clock, he still got fired for posession."
29-03-2018T00:13:48,Bigboi182,"Well I don't see him here, so it's safe to say he's gone... for now"
29-03-2018T00:13:52,SpazztasticKiwi,And privacy
29-03-2018T00:14:19,Bigboi182,"So, you guys were talking about the calendar?"
29-03-2018T00:14:19,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it was a dick move, and he got fired as well."
29-03-2018T00:14:44,SpazztasticKiwi,This is why I have a password on all my devices
29-03-2018T00:14:48,unsteddyphoenix,oof nightmare
29-03-2018T00:14:55,SpazztasticKiwi,And not another soul knows them
29-03-2018T00:14:57,Dadrobit,"Long story short, I had a fair bit of overtime that month."
29-03-2018T00:15:22,Bigboi182,Privacy is important. Don't screw with people's privacy.
29-03-2018T00:15:33,Dadrobit,"Yeah, the entire post felt really terrible about what happened, he was a #QualityDude."
29-03-2018T00:15:47,Bigboi182,So.... the calendar!
29-03-2018T00:15:51,Vatruvius,I have no nude photos on my devices...so no worries here.
29-03-2018T00:15:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Nope
29-03-2018T00:16:49,Vatruvius,It was in the moment Bigboi...you missed it. The subject has been dropped.
29-03-2018T00:17:01,Bigboi182,Great...
29-03-2018T00:17:09,Bigboi182,"Well, what now?"
29-03-2018T00:17:24,Vatruvius,Stuff.
29-03-2018T00:18:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera’s nickname is Twinkle Toes
29-03-2018T00:18:26,SpazztasticKiwi,One of them anyway
29-03-2018T00:20:07,Bigboi182,They have more than one nickname?
29-03-2018T00:20:20,Dadrobit,Facey-Face
29-03-2018T00:20:49,Bigboi182,Huh.
29-03-2018T00:21:39,Bgrmystr2,Why would the job fire the guy for what he has on his personal phone
29-03-2018T00:21:58,Bgrmystr2,the job has literally no say-so in what his phone has on it
29-03-2018T00:22:52,Dadrobit,"Phones weren't allowed anyways, and possession of pornography in any form is a fire-able offense."
29-03-2018T00:23:13,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: in a security job? How the fuck are phones not allowed? xD
29-03-2018T00:23:39,Dadrobit,Including nudes texted to you from your boyfriend on Valentine's Day.
29-03-2018T00:23:57,Dadrobit,Most all posts forbid phones.
29-03-2018T00:24:05,Dadrobit,They're a distraction.
29-03-2018T00:24:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Fur Ball and Munchkin are two others
29-03-2018T00:24:11,Bgrmystr2,that seems dumb as shit.
29-03-2018T00:24:25,Bgrmystr2,what happens if the phone in your place gets fucked off for some reason
29-03-2018T00:24:40,Bgrmystr2,you gonna call with your imaginary hand phone from inspector gadget?
29-03-2018T00:24:50,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-unimpressed: yeah ok
29-03-2018T00:25:06,Dadrobit,"If it's an emergency, you'd use your personal to call 911 and document it in your AAR."
29-03-2018T00:25:07,SpazztasticKiwi,They can be distracting if you have your face buried in them any other time
29-03-2018T00:25:22,Dadrobit,But it should be locked up in your locker before you log in
29-03-2018T00:25:32,Bgrmystr2,but you're not allowed to have it on you dadro :/
29-03-2018T00:25:36,Bgrmystr2,so how would you have it
29-03-2018T00:25:50,Dadrobit,It would be in your locker 15 feet away.
29-03-2018T00:25:59,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
29-03-2018T00:26:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"So if it’s enough of an emergency, you dead"
29-03-2018T00:26:27,Bgrmystr2,I was imagining one of those small dinkass security huts that have the gates and stuff
29-03-2018T00:26:49,Bgrmystr2,"and if a car blows through the hut itself, the motherfucker stationed in there ain't gonna be using that hut's phone to call for help"
29-03-2018T00:26:51,Bgrmystr2,can promise you that one
29-03-2018T00:26:53,Dadrobit,"Naw, this was a hella good post. My security house was larger than my first apartment."
29-03-2018T00:27:21,Bgrmystr2,yeh ok I can see that
29-03-2018T00:27:38,Bgrmystr2,I dunno. someone goin digging through a phone seems kinda dumb tho
29-03-2018T00:27:47,Dadrobit,"Yeah, he was fired as well."
29-03-2018T00:27:55,Bgrmystr2,for going though the guy's phone?
29-03-2018T00:28:00,Dadrobit,Yup
29-03-2018T00:28:02,Bgrmystr2,good
29-03-2018T00:28:21,Dadrobit,"He was brand new on the post, first month."
29-03-2018T00:28:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"“You’re an invasive dick, but your plan still worked”"
29-03-2018T00:28:40,Dadrobit,They didn't want to deal with that kinda shit for any amount of time.
29-03-2018T00:29:37,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
29-03-2018T00:29:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m gonna try goin on to bed
29-03-2018T00:29:55,Dadrobit,:D I'm still giddy that I finally got that Keith dinner sketch done.
29-03-2018T00:30:03,Bgrmystr2,I don't know if I would work at a place that didn't value people having a phone actually ON them in case of emergency
29-03-2018T00:30:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll se you sometime tomorrow
29-03-2018T00:30:09,Dadrobit,"If you're around, Tom. Thanks for that again."
29-03-2018T00:30:21,TheBeckoner,Just got back from helping a buddies buddy get unstuck. Dude drove a fatass Tahoe into 1 foot + of mud...
29-03-2018T00:30:28,TheBeckoner,Got free food out of it tho
29-03-2018T00:30:51,TheBeckoner,Also got to do donuts on some gravel
29-03-2018T00:30:56,TheBeckoner,good times
29-03-2018T00:31:23,SpazztasticKiwi,What possessed him to think such a big car was good in that much mud
29-03-2018T00:31:36,TheBeckoner,No clue
29-03-2018T00:31:48,TheBeckoner,Kept rambling on about some boards or something lol
29-03-2018T00:31:53,TheBeckoner,he was stressed
29-03-2018T00:31:54,SpazztasticKiwi,“Hold my beer” mentality?
29-03-2018T00:32:09,Bgrmystr2,"because big cars actually do decent in mud, kiwi"
29-03-2018T00:32:12,Bgrmystr2,unlike little cars
29-03-2018T00:32:14,Bgrmystr2,which tend to not.
29-03-2018T00:32:20,TheBeckoner,"He was suposed to clean the area of trash but wasnt supposed to drive to it. he figured ""fuck it I'll be fine"""
29-03-2018T00:32:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Or “Hey y’all watch this?”
29-03-2018T00:32:22,Dadrobit,The likelihood of something happening to their landline phones going down and an officer getting hurt was next to nothing compared to knowing that having a personal phone would cause enough of a distraction that they wouldn't be monitoring a camera to see
29-03-2018T00:32:35,Dadrobit,someone or something else getting hurt.
29-03-2018T00:33:05,Bgrmystr2,"trucks with bigass wheels can easily handle mud, though 1+foot deep mud is not something you'd be able to see coming, nevermind expect"
29-03-2018T00:33:05,TheBeckoner,Well he was alone Kiwi...for like 8 hours lol
29-03-2018T00:33:13,Bgrmystr2,can't see through mud lol
29-03-2018T00:33:18,TheBeckoner,^^^
29-03-2018T00:33:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Too much mud
29-03-2018T00:33:31,Bgrmystr2,"I guess, dadro"
29-03-2018T00:33:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"But really, gn guys"
29-03-2018T00:34:00,TheBeckoner,One guy had a 4x4 but couldnt drive it so I used it while my direct friend sat in the whale of an SUV and inched it along
29-03-2018T00:34:05,Bgrmystr2,"if they are allowing the phones to be a personal distraction, they're not a really good set of security guys though.."
29-03-2018T00:34:05,TheBeckoner,Shoulda taken pictures
29-03-2018T00:34:07,Vatruvius,Goodnight Kiwi!
29-03-2018T00:34:19,TheBeckoner,Fucking amazing he made as far as he did
29-03-2018T00:34:32,TheBeckoner,Night Spazz
29-03-2018T00:34:40,Dadrobit,"No guessing to be done. The policy was in place and we ~STILL~ had officers fucking off for an entire shift on their phones for us to get complaints about ""How did you not notice this was happening?!?!"""
29-03-2018T00:34:46,Dadrobit,Night Spazz
29-03-2018T00:35:48,TheBeckoner,Afterwards the dude who was stuck paid for some Mcdonalds (Only thing open) He bought a meal to feed a family of 6 and ate it all...
29-03-2018T00:35:49,Dadrobit,"The site I was on required a lot of professionalism, but still some guys and gals slipped through the cracks."
29-03-2018T00:36:07,Dadrobit,Security in general will hire anyone with a warm body.
29-03-2018T00:36:07,Bgrmystr2,"man, maybe it's just me, but I would say fuck the no-phones policy, but I also wouldn't be ON my phone on a job like that to begin with."
29-03-2018T00:36:17,TheBeckoner,lol
29-03-2018T00:36:33,Bgrmystr2,"I'd only have it on me just in case someshit happened, and I don't have a phone right there, right then."
29-03-2018T00:37:01,Dadrobit,Too much temptation. Spending 12+ hours and only seeing a dozen people the entire time gets to you.
29-03-2018T00:37:01,Vatruvius,"I am starting to feel compelled to just sit, listen to music, and go through every post Tom has on his patreon."
29-03-2018T00:37:18,Dadrobit,And the landlines are placed all throughout the house.
29-03-2018T00:37:19,TheBeckoner,Sounds like a good plan
29-03-2018T00:37:36,Dadrobit,Always in arms reach.
29-03-2018T00:37:45,Vatruvius,Can you listen to music at least Dadrobit?
29-03-2018T00:38:06,Bgrmystr2,"You guys weren't super out there in the lil guard shacks, were you lol"
29-03-2018T00:38:08,Dadrobit,"I brought in my Walkman and hooked it up to a stereo, but most people just turned on the radio."
29-03-2018T00:39:07,Dadrobit,"It was off the beaten path, a community and club inset into a mountainside. But we had a police and fire station right off of our connecting road."
29-03-2018T00:39:13,Vatruvius,Got to switch to my phone...my computer is dying and I need to lay in bed. BRB
29-03-2018T00:39:18,Bgrmystr2,I see
29-03-2018T00:39:19,Dadrobit,Response time of just over a minute.
29-03-2018T00:39:31,Dadrobit,Called on them a couple times lol.
29-03-2018T00:39:55,Bgrmystr2,"Around here, all the security features I see are the small guard shacks that are probably like 3foot by 3foot wide, or 5 by 5 foot.."
29-03-2018T00:39:57,Bgrmystr2,the lil square boxes
29-03-2018T00:40:03,Dadrobit,Fuck that.
29-03-2018T00:40:07,Bgrmystr2,and like.. it's just one guy
29-03-2018T00:40:28,Bgrmystr2,next to the bar that he raises when ppl stop and he makes sure they're who they are
29-03-2018T00:40:36,Bgrmystr2,"yeah you say security, I think thatguy"
29-03-2018T00:40:40,Dadrobit,"This was in Scottsdale, super rich folks live in the mansions behind my gate."
29-03-2018T00:40:43,TheBeckoner,"""I am who I am"" ""you good"""
29-03-2018T00:40:53,Bgrmystr2,flawless logic beck

29-03-2018T00:41:34,Bgrmystr2,that reminds me of a subdivision somewhat not so nearby
29-03-2018T00:41:40,Dadrobit,"Was a hella nice gig, but I quit last year."
29-03-2018T00:41:46,Bgrmystr2,about 45mins away or so.. English Turn

29-03-2018T00:43:13,Bgrmystr2,all like $1k or $1500 + per month
29-03-2018T00:43:16,Dadrobit,Moat and everything.

29-03-2018T00:44:23,Dadrobit,"Dude had a Porche delivered every 6 months or so, but he was still a super cool dude."
29-03-2018T00:44:50,Dadrobit,He was one of the ones that didn't mind stopping by the guard house just to chat and share a coffee.
29-03-2018T00:45:25,Bgrmystr2,"man, microsoft support.. why u so bad.. :("
29-03-2018T00:45:32,Vatruvius,At least he was cool.

29-03-2018T00:45:48,Vatruvius,What is wrong Bgr?
29-03-2018T00:45:49,Dadrobit,"Ah, and don't know if you saw earlier, just wanted to thank you again for the sketch, Tom."
29-03-2018T00:46:15,Vatruvius,When did he do that sketch?
29-03-2018T00:46:44,Dadrobit,Late last year.
29-03-2018T00:46:46,Bgrmystr2,"Microsoft account won't recieve emails cuz the alias is wrong, and I can't fix the alias because that's the only one on the account to begin with.. and I can't add the one the account comes with cuz it gives me the ""can't do that"" error."
29-03-2018T00:47:07,Bgrmystr2,and there is no live chat
29-03-2018T00:47:09,Bgrmystr2,at all.
29-03-2018T00:47:17,Bigboi182,"Microsoft is full of BS sometimes, so I understand that."
29-03-2018T00:47:18,Twokinds,"Oh, you're welcome"
29-03-2018T00:47:38,Bgrmystr2,Oh.. M$ why :(
29-03-2018T00:47:40,Bigboi182,I'm surprised you remember that Dad...
29-03-2018T00:47:58,Bgrmystr2,how would he not? It took him 7 months to get the thing sketched
29-03-2018T00:48:03,Bgrmystr2,:u
29-03-2018T00:48:09,Dadrobit,"Yeah, lol, was about to say."
29-03-2018T00:48:44,Vatruvius,You should try AT&T support...they ended up transfering me 5 times...gave me a number to call...called that number...more transfering...then transfered me to a discontinued number.
29-03-2018T00:48:54,Vatruvius,All of that...twice.
29-03-2018T00:49:30,Bgrmystr2,I dunno if microsoft is any better
29-03-2018T00:50:30,Vatruvius,I never needed to use their support because nothing of theirs broke for me...or at leaste nothing a simple google search could give me.
29-03-2018T00:51:12,Bgrmystr2,"prolly cuz you don't use a bunch of microsoft stuff. I don't either, I just figured they would be the easiest since I already had an account"
29-03-2018T00:51:23,Bgrmystr2,mistakes were made :ptv-uneasy:
29-03-2018T00:51:40,unsteddyphoenix,Remember every sketch
29-03-2018T00:52:21,Vatruvius,Are you trying to use their email system?
29-03-2018T00:52:23,unsteddyphoenix,No matter the suffering
29-03-2018T00:53:49,Bgrmystr2,"Only temporarily, Vatru"
29-03-2018T00:53:55,Bgrmystr2,cuz I can't make a new email via google or yahoo
29-03-2018T00:54:43,unsteddyphoenix,Was the stream today only 3 hours?
29-03-2018T00:54:48,Vatruvius,Okay?
29-03-2018T00:54:49,unsteddyphoenix,"Damn, pretty fast"
29-03-2018T00:54:58,Twokinds,Was it only 3 hours?
29-03-2018T00:55:01,Twokinds,Huh
29-03-2018T00:55:14,Vatruvius,That sounds right.
29-03-2018T00:55:29,unsteddyphoenix,3:17 accordin' to the recording
29-03-2018T00:56:45,Dadrobit,"Was in class when it started, still got to see a goodly portion of it it seems."
29-03-2018T00:57:18,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
29-03-2018T00:58:23,unsteddyphoenix,"Less to watch before bed though, rip~"
29-03-2018T00:58:24,Dadrobit,Had to create an Avante Garde piece for my music class. So I recorded myself running a metal ruler over the strings of my guitar as I detuned it. Worked pretty well.
29-03-2018T00:58:45,unsteddyphoenix,acoustic?
29-03-2018T00:58:48,Dadrobit,Yes
29-03-2018T00:59:12,unsteddyphoenix,"Huh, cool."
29-03-2018T00:59:22,Dadrobit,Did it in my bathroom to get a nice natural reverb in the sound.
29-03-2018T00:59:23,unsteddyphoenix,sound effexts/foley in songs is all the rage nowadays
29-03-2018T00:59:27,unsteddyphoenix,Along with random voice clips
29-03-2018T00:59:44,unsteddyphoenix,Lol I recorded in my bathroom too
29-03-2018T00:59:47,Vatruvius,What? That seems like it would sound awful.
29-03-2018T00:59:57,Dadrobit,Did that as well. Kind of. I put in some screaming that a classmate did for her project.
29-03-2018T01:00:29,Dadrobit,My piece was very horror bsaed.
29-03-2018T01:00:31,Dadrobit,based*
29-03-2018T01:00:43,unsteddyphoenix,"Ahh ok, was confused"
29-03-2018T01:00:49,Vatruvius,I see...
29-03-2018T01:01:25,Dadrobit,Horror inspired I should say.
29-03-2018T01:01:42,unsteddyphoenix,but what about loFi hiphop beats to study/relax to?
29-03-2018T01:02:27,Dadrobit,That's a distinct style. This assignment demanded it be avante garde.
29-03-2018T01:02:54,Vatruvius,What is avente garde?
29-03-2018T01:02:57,unsteddyphoenix,Oh tru.
29-03-2018T01:03:15,Dadrobit,experimental or unusual ideas
29-03-2018T01:03:18,unsteddyphoenix,"pretentious arty way to say ""new"""
29-03-2018T01:03:43,unsteddyphoenix,"""fresh and spicy"""
29-03-2018T01:04:13,Dadrobit,The spiciest of ruler guitar riffs
29-03-2018T01:04:14,Vatruvius,So like how anything counts as art in post-modernism...anything if it has not been done is avante garde?
29-03-2018T01:05:37,Dadrobit,"Not really? The driving point of something being avante garde is that it is most often not just new, but very unusual."
29-03-2018T01:06:01,Dadrobit,Like how one composer created a song that was just several minutes of silence.
29-03-2018T01:06:06,Vatruvius,Like a ruler on a guitar.
29-03-2018T01:06:14,Dadrobit,Or like using a ruler on a guitar
29-03-2018T01:06:17,unsteddyphoenix,lol
29-03-2018T01:07:09,Vatruvius,Wasn't the point of the silence the music or rather combination of sounds the audience made?
29-03-2018T01:08:28,Dadrobit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTEFKFiXSx4
29-03-2018T01:08:42,Dadrobit,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%E2%80%B233%E2%80%B3
29-03-2018T01:09:49,Dadrobit,Other silent songs include such masterpieces as Funeral March for the Obsequies of a Deaf Man.
29-03-2018T01:10:52,unsteddyphoenix,"composed in 1952, for any instrument or combination of instruments,"
29-03-2018T01:11:02,unsteddyphoenix,"Amazing, you can play it on anything!"
29-03-2018T01:11:52,Vatruvius,It is bot really neat but also kinda disappointeing for the ticket buyers you expected something else.
29-03-2018T01:12:07,Vatruvius,Both*
29-03-2018T01:12:34,Vatruvius,I am sure they did some actual playing later on.
29-03-2018T01:12:56,Dadrobit,Of course
29-03-2018T01:13:19,Dadrobit,Never been to a concert that only played one song lol

29-03-2018T01:22:31,TheBeckoner,"I agree, but I cant make her do anything and I was ready to have it over with"
29-03-2018T01:22:42,NightMeaty22,i know what thats like it sucks hair + drain is total crap

29-03-2018T01:58:51,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
29-03-2018T01:58:55,unsteddyphoenix,the gangs all here
29-03-2018T01:59:25,unsteddyphoenix,Did you get an instant grade?
29-03-2018T02:00:05,Dadrobit,"Yeah. Technically I missed one question the first time, but only because I somehow missed it and just didn't answer."
29-03-2018T02:00:14,Dadrobit,So I had to retake it just for that one point.
29-03-2018T02:00:43,Dadrobit,I do have to wait for my essay to be graded by a person though.
29-03-2018T02:00:55,Dadrobit,But that usually only takes about two days.
29-03-2018T02:01:03,unsteddyphoenix,How inefficient
29-03-2018T02:02:39,Dadrobit,I'm just mystified that I somehow missed a question. It was only a T/F as well.
29-03-2018T02:02:51,Dadrobit,"""Songwriter’s can join as many PROs as they want at any given time?"""
29-03-2018T02:03:15,Dadrobit,False btw
29-03-2018T02:03:45,Twokinds,True
29-03-2018T02:04:10,unsteddyphoenix,Performance rights organisation?
29-03-2018T02:04:19,Dadrobit,Correct.
29-03-2018T02:04:23,unsteddyphoenix,"Ah, ok."
29-03-2018T02:04:27,unsteddyphoenix,True then.
29-03-2018T02:04:33,Twokinds,Seems like one of those really obvious questions
29-03-2018T02:04:44,Twokinds,"Like, why are you asking me this if it was anything but false"
29-03-2018T02:04:46,Dadrobit,Performing Rights Organization
29-03-2018T02:05:21,unsteddyphoenix,The way they phrased it is suspect
29-03-2018T02:05:35,unsteddyphoenix,As MANY as they want at ANY give time
29-03-2018T02:05:45,Dadrobit,"Because while songwriters cannot join multiple PROs, Publishers can."
29-03-2018T02:06:09,Twokinds,"I'm pretty sure if you had so many absolutes in a sentence, the answer would always be false from SOME technicalit."
29-03-2018T02:06:27,Dadrobit,They talk about a couple different variations and are hoping you get some of the terms mixed up.
29-03-2018T02:06:28,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah.
29-03-2018T02:06:55,unsteddyphoenix,How underhanded¬
29-03-2018T02:08:37,Dadrobit,"A little bit I guess, but that's how tests are sometime."
29-03-2018T02:08:43,Dadrobit,Gotta keep on your toes.
29-03-2018T02:09:11,Dadrobit,Doing pretty well so far. 97% overall.
29-03-2018T02:10:07,unsteddyphoenix,I resent your good grades
29-03-2018T02:10:27,Dadrobit,"As poorly produced as the slide shows are sometimes, I find it kinda fun learning about all the technicalities in copyright law stuffs."
29-03-2018T02:10:43,Dadrobit,Fair use and all that jazz
29-03-2018T02:11:35,Dadrobit,"Hey, I'm not perfect ya know. I've gotten B's too."
29-03-2018T02:11:37,unsteddyphoenix,Seems like a murky subject with all these parodies and remixes
29-03-2018T02:12:11,unsteddyphoenix,I had a b- average and I was proud.
29-03-2018T02:12:38,Dadrobit,"Actually, looking at my overall, with how many classes I dropped and or failed in my earlier attempts, I only have a 3.0 GPA overall."
29-03-2018T02:13:09,unsteddyphoenix,I dont think we use GPA but I know 4.0 is good from tv
29-03-2018T02:13:45,Dadrobit,"1=D, 2=C, 3=B, 4=A"
29-03-2018T02:14:41,unsteddyphoenix,Hmm~
29-03-2018T02:14:48,unsteddyphoenix,Why do your previous classes count?
29-03-2018T02:14:48,Dadrobit,Had to raise it from an abysmal 1.25 three years ago.
29-03-2018T02:15:08,unsteddyphoenix,"That seems kinda messed up. Only your current grade should matter, surely."
29-03-2018T02:15:29,Dadrobit,"Eh, the classes don't go away unless you retake them."
29-03-2018T02:16:10,Dadrobit,I actually had a 0.5 in 2012
29-03-2018T02:16:16,Dadrobit,Fuck I was retarded.
29-03-2018T02:16:24,unsteddyphoenix,0.5...
29-03-2018T02:16:37,unsteddyphoenix,I only hear about 3.0s or 4.0 I had no idea it could get that low lol
29-03-2018T02:16:47,Dadrobit,LMAO
29-03-2018T02:17:33,unsteddyphoenix,I guess that's all bragging :thinking:
29-03-2018T02:17:43,Dadrobit,"I got a D in Racial & Ethnic Minorities, and I stopped going to my World Religions class halfway through the semester for a solid F."
29-03-2018T02:18:10,unsteddyphoenix,So you are religiously intolerant and are racist?
29-03-2018T02:18:16,Dadrobit,Pretty much
29-03-2018T02:18:35,unsteddyphoenix,Were those classes...compulsory for some reason?
29-03-2018T02:18:48,unsteddyphoenix,"'cause, they do not sound fun, especially the minority one"
29-03-2018T02:18:55,Dadrobit,"Actually I liked the religion class waaaaay more, but I missed a few classes for video games and was too embarrassed to go back."
29-03-2018T02:19:15,unsteddyphoenix,D'aw.
29-03-2018T02:19:26,unsteddyphoenix,"The religion one I could see being interesting, I suppose."
29-03-2018T02:19:29,Dadrobit,They were humanities I was taking for my video game design degree.
29-03-2018T02:20:04,unsteddyphoenix,Ech. So glad I more-or-less got to pick my electives
29-03-2018T02:20:24,Dadrobit,"The ethnic minorities class professor was a bitch. It was all just a ""shame the white man"" class."
29-03-2018T02:20:52,unsteddyphoenix,How could it possibly be anything else from that name lol
29-03-2018T02:21:01,Dadrobit,"Same, I picked them because I had the dumb something fierce."
29-03-2018T02:21:23,Dadrobit,I would actually like to retake the religions one if I find the time/money.
29-03-2018T02:21:34,unsteddyphoenix,Did you think it'd be easy A's or?
29-03-2018T02:21:46,Dadrobit,"Yeah, pretty much."
29-03-2018T02:21:55,unsteddyphoenix,Niiice~
29-03-2018T02:22:09,Dadrobit,"Better than ""History of East Asia Through the 17th Century"""
29-03-2018T02:22:10,unsteddyphoenix,"What's a ""humanity"", is it classes like the ones you described?"
29-03-2018T02:22:30,unsteddyphoenix,That sounds alright :thinking:
29-03-2018T02:22:52,Dadrobit,Generally they're ones that deal with metaphysical concepts.
29-03-2018T02:23:51,Dadrobit,Unlike something like Maths that have absolute answers that generally do not change
29-03-2018T02:24:15,unsteddyphoenix,History is metaphysical?
29-03-2018T02:24:20,unsteddyphoenix,I suppose the argument can be made but...
29-03-2018T02:24:41,Dadrobit,Often circling around the study of human culture
29-03-2018T02:25:07,Dadrobit,"And I said ""generally"" lol"
29-03-2018T02:25:30,unsteddyphoenix,Fair
29-03-2018T02:25:45,unsteddyphoenix,"Is ""english"" another one."
29-03-2018T02:25:58,Dadrobit,"From the internet: The humanities are those disciplines that study human culture and experience, including areas such as the arts, history and language."
29-03-2018T02:26:11,Dadrobit,"College undergraduate programs typically include humanities classes as part of general education requirements, even for majors such as engineering."
29-03-2018T02:26:54,Dadrobit,Humanities courses vary widely in scope and are available at all levels of college study
29-03-2018T02:27:50,unsteddyphoenix,That really bothers me. All the money wasted doing classes you dont really want to do...
29-03-2018T02:27:58,Dadrobit,English probably counts as a humanities class in non-native English speaking countries.
29-03-2018T02:28:18,unsteddyphoenix,I guess I meant more literature studies or whatever
29-03-2018T02:29:03,Dadrobit,Otherwise it's considered and English class.
29-03-2018T02:29:39,Dadrobit,"Although, there is the subsection, English Humanities."
29-03-2018T02:29:52,Dadrobit,"Because fuck you, take more humanities"
29-03-2018T02:30:13,Dadrobit,"Also, that's exactly why I'm not going for a traditional degree."
29-03-2018T02:30:30,Dadrobit,I'm instead getting a certificate of completion.
29-03-2018T02:30:34,unsteddyphoenix,"Big same, I picked my degree specifically to avoid that."
29-03-2018T02:30:56,unsteddyphoenix,"No exams, no random compulsory classes"

29-03-2018T02:39:46,Dadrobit,"Exactly, They want you taking 3-4 classes a semester, but there were a few where I only took 2"

29-03-2018T04:27:23,Dadrobit,Actually killed me.
29-03-2018T04:27:33,Bgrmystr2,that poor guy sitting there silent
29-03-2018T04:27:35,unsteddyphoenix,the engineer was the best actor
29-03-2018T04:27:37,Bgrmystr2,he wanted to facepalm so hard
29-03-2018T04:27:45,Bgrmystr2,I felt so bad for him hahah
29-03-2018T04:27:54,unsteddyphoenix,You could feel how done with their shit he was
29-03-2018T04:27:56,Bgrmystr2,he couldnt words..
29-03-2018T04:28:31,Dadrobit,"He looks like he has just the tiniest bit of life left in him, and this session is threatening to take that away."
29-03-2018T04:29:00,Twokinds,I wish house prices would stop going up and up. And interest rates are sent to go up too. Just in time.
29-03-2018T04:29:35,unsteddyphoenix,I also feel this way.
29-03-2018T04:29:39,Bgrmystr2,"brb, gotta throw a bandaid on myself. A bug stabbed me or whatever."
29-03-2018T04:29:47,Dadrobit,"Yeah, you'd figure after the 08 crash, they'd maybe learn some stability?"
29-03-2018T04:30:05,unsteddyphoenix,When is this alleged bubble going to burst
29-03-2018T04:30:12,Dadrobit,Again you mean.
29-03-2018T04:30:21,Twokinds,"I know it's terrible, but I'm kinda hoping houses pop again just a bit"
29-03-2018T04:30:27,Twokinds,Would help me out XD
29-03-2018T04:30:34,Dadrobit,"Give it 10-15 more years, it's gonna be a generational thing I think."
29-03-2018T04:30:54,Twokinds,Then again that'd take out my stock.
29-03-2018T04:30:56,unsteddyphoenix,I could see that
29-03-2018T04:31:01,Twokinds,Probably. So maybe not.
29-03-2018T04:31:19,unsteddyphoenix,Stock? Can you...invest in housing?
29-03-2018T04:31:19,Dadrobit,It helped out my pops lol. After the crash he bought all the houses surrounding him for dirt cheap.
29-03-2018T04:31:34,Dadrobit,It's all hopelessly connected man.
29-03-2018T04:31:58,Dadrobit,"Housing market crashed, and so did everyone's 401k"
29-03-2018T04:31:59,unsteddyphoenix,Apparently.
29-03-2018T04:32:11,unsteddyphoenix,"Thats the retirement thing, right"
29-03-2018T04:32:15,Dadrobit,Correct
29-03-2018T04:32:38,Dadrobit,Which was financed by assuming everyone would be able to pay their ever increasing mortgages
29-03-2018T04:32:52,iliar,"@Twokinds I wonder when you are talking about a large interest rate, what do you mean? 5% per year? 10% per year?"
29-03-2018T04:32:58,Dadrobit,"When the money coming in couldn't keep up, everything fell to shit"
29-03-2018T04:33:29,Twokinds,Interest is currently around 4% here
29-03-2018T04:33:31,unsteddyphoenix,'cause people couldnt afford to put away...
29-03-2018T04:33:41,Twokinds,You can get more or less depending on a lot of factors
29-03-2018T04:33:43,Dadrobit,"Rates went way down to try and salvage the situation, and now they're back on the rise"
29-03-2018T04:33:52,Twokinds,Soon it'll be 5
29-03-2018T04:34:38,Dadrobit,"People were too broke already from trying to keep up with ridiculous loans, and then they found out their retirements were cut down 75%"
29-03-2018T04:34:42,iliar,Well... In Russia a good option is 12%
29-03-2018T04:36:00,unsteddyphoenix,Oof
29-03-2018T04:36:12,unsteddyphoenix,im sure that went down well
29-03-2018T04:36:52,Dadrobit,"Yeah, especially when the govt bailed out all the banks that made it happen."
29-03-2018T04:37:17,unsteddyphoenix,I remember that bit
29-03-2018T04:37:24,unsteddyphoenix,"The ""too big to fail"" banks"
29-03-2018T04:38:53,Twokinds,A 12% interest rate on a house would be... very bad D:
29-03-2018T04:39:01,Dadrobit,"Yeah, because a lot of those banks held a LOT of people's 401k's. So they got bailed out so that people only lost 75% instead of 100%"
29-03-2018T04:39:30,Dadrobit,Not to mention all the house mortgages that would have defaulted
29-03-2018T04:40:37,Dadrobit,The very mortgages that caused the investment crash.
29-03-2018T04:40:54,unsteddyphoenix,Hooo~
29-03-2018T04:41:12,Twokinds,arg it's almost 6am
29-03-2018T04:41:17,unsteddyphoenix,I never knew people lost chunks of their retirements
29-03-2018T04:41:20,Bgrmystr2,yeh tom :/
29-03-2018T04:41:22,Bgrmystr2,also back
29-03-2018T04:41:30,Bgrmystr2,this bandaid is gonna be a bitch to take off later :(
29-03-2018T04:41:38,Twokinds,I'm too tired trying to make this text work
29-03-2018T04:41:42,Twokinds,Gunna sleep on it
29-03-2018T04:41:48,Dadrobit,"Yup, the banks had to pay off then investors somehow, so they ""borrowed"" from everyone's retirement funds."
29-03-2018T04:42:02,Bgrmystr2,"Welp, that answers my question, tom XD"
29-03-2018T04:42:02,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, I cant write while im tired."
29-03-2018T04:42:03,Dadrobit,"Good luck, Tom."
29-03-2018T04:42:14,unsteddyphoenix,"I can practise drawing, but I cant write normally"
29-03-2018T04:43:09,unsteddyphoenix,That makes sense but damn. Country wide suffering as a result.
29-03-2018T04:43:19,Dadrobit,The investors wanted to invest more money into mortgage bundles because traditionally they were very safe investments as only financially stable people could get a mortgage in the first place.
29-03-2018T04:44:08,Bgrmystr2,"the more time goes on, the more I think the housing market will crash bigtime"
29-03-2018T04:44:12,Dadrobit,So the banks started giving out mortgages to people without good credit or stable income to create more investment opportunities.
29-03-2018T04:44:29,Bgrmystr2,cuz it seems like they're continuing  to keep in place the very things that keep crashing the market to begin with
29-03-2018T04:44:35,Dadrobit,All the while house prices and rates were on the rise.
29-03-2018T04:44:48,iliar,"To be honest, I'm not entirely sure about this. Our interest rate also depends on many factors. And in theory, you can get 5-7% per year. At least that's what they say in advertising. But my friends say about 12%."
29-03-2018T04:45:10,Dadrobit,"And they kept on the facade that they were ""safe"" investments while they were doing it."
29-03-2018T04:45:54,unsteddyphoenix,Did the investors just...not know?
29-03-2018T04:46:00,Twokinds,Yeah I watched a documentary on the crash not too long ago. Lots of shady stuff.
29-03-2018T04:46:37,Dadrobit,"Not really, the investments were considered AAA safe investments and no one was looking to change that information."
29-03-2018T04:46:43,Twokinds,A lot of people had no idea their investments were tangled up in those bundles
29-03-2018T04:47:28,Dadrobit,"And the investors weren't just going after single mortgages, they were all tied together in big stacks you could buy portions of, or were tied into other investments."
29-03-2018T04:47:56,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh wow, that is shady"
29-03-2018T04:48:22,unsteddyphoenix,I cant believe there wasnt already laws preventing that
29-03-2018T04:48:26,Twokinds,I'm headed to bed
29-03-2018T04:48:36,Twokinds,G'night!
29-03-2018T04:48:39,Dadrobit,"Alright man, have a good one!"
29-03-2018T04:48:43,iliar,"Good night, Tom!"
29-03-2018T04:48:52,unsteddyphoenix,Gnight Tom
29-03-2018T04:49:02,Dadrobit,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPOv72Awo68 Here, this is a nice summary"
29-03-2018T04:49:19,unsteddyphoenix,crash courses...
29-03-2018T04:49:27,unsteddyphoenix,I already like this channels concept
29-03-2018T04:50:38,Dadrobit,Essentially it was unregulated betting.
29-03-2018T05:00:23,Dadrobit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO_BMxny34U The first bit explains it pretty well using cat infographics.
29-03-2018T05:03:33,unsteddyphoenix,You have my attention

29-03-2018T05:05:37,unsteddyphoenix,I appreciate your jacket-over-nothing chic
29-03-2018T05:06:20,Dadrobit,"I usually have more chest hair to compensate, but I waxed for the video"
29-03-2018T05:12:47,unsteddyphoenix,"Every time he says ""Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac"" I keep thinking theyre like, personifications for something. But thats actually what theyre called"
29-03-2018T05:12:49,unsteddyphoenix,Who did tihs
29-03-2018T05:13:17,Dadrobit,Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac probably
29-03-2018T05:13:42,unsteddyphoenix,Tell them I dislike them.
29-03-2018T05:14:24,Dadrobit,I'll get right on it.
29-03-2018T05:19:57,Dadrobit,"Alrighty, it's past 3am, I think I'm gonna get some shut eye."
29-03-2018T05:20:27,Dadrobit,Have a good one!
29-03-2018T05:20:45,unsteddyphoenix,"Fair enough, thanks for the seminar daddy gnight"
29-03-2018T05:21:12,Dadrobit,"Lol, you're welcome."

29-03-2018T05:38:59,Dadrobit,Kitten had gotten out sometime in the day and was trapped outside.

29-03-2018T05:47:56,Bgrmystr2,can't recall the name of them
29-03-2018T05:48:06,Bgrmystr2,there were a few in my band class in high school

29-03-2018T12:37:29,TheGamePlayer,me?
29-03-2018T12:38:08,Vatruvius,Referring to the fact that I am naming my entire game library. :ptv-tease:
29-03-2018T12:38:42,TheGamePlayer,ok
29-03-2018T12:40:38,Vatruvius,Have you ever played the Metro series of games?
29-03-2018T12:40:51,TheGamePlayer,no
29-03-2018T12:42:15,Vatruvius,They are really good...and they are making another one coming out within a year.
29-03-2018T12:43:10,TheGamePlayer,ok coo
29-03-2018T12:43:14,TheGamePlayer,lcool
29-03-2018T12:43:18,TheGamePlayer,cool
29-03-2018T12:43:21,TheGamePlayer,wtf
29-03-2018T12:44:05,Vatruvius,?
29-03-2018T12:44:07,TheGamePlayer,why do I always manage to mess uo typing
29-03-2018T12:44:15,Vatruvius,haha
29-03-2018T12:44:20,TheGamePlayer,OH COME ON
29-03-2018T12:44:28,TheGamePlayer,"""uo"""
29-03-2018T12:46:06,Vatruvius,Catch them before pressing enter. I type without having to look at the keyboard...I was actually the best and fastest typer in my class in middle school. So I just watch what I am typing and fix mistakes as I see them.
29-03-2018T12:48:16,TheGamePlayer,i look at the keyboard yet manage to mess up
29-03-2018T12:48:50,TheGamePlayer,I might just get city skylines
29-03-2018T12:50:01,TheGamePlayer,nah nvm
29-03-2018T12:50:03,Vatruvius,Also a good option...I do not own it nor have any playtime in it but it is certainly something I am looking at. I have Simcity so I play that if I want to build cities. Also I just bought $80 worth of games during the spring sale and have 9+ games to play
29-03-2018T12:50:39,TheGamePlayer,nice
29-03-2018T12:50:45,Vatruvius,Prey is also really good.
29-03-2018T12:53:17,TheGamePlayer,looks awesome but I dont think thats within my budget
29-03-2018T12:53:37,TheGamePlayer,ya im short $3
29-03-2018T12:53:43,Vatruvius,What is your budget?
29-03-2018T12:53:55,TheGamePlayer,$37
29-03-2018T12:54:20,TheGamePlayer,all i got
29-03-2018T12:54:28,Vatruvius,Have you seen Subnautica?
29-03-2018T12:54:34,TheGamePlayer,own it
29-03-2018T12:54:38,TheGamePlayer,its cool
29-03-2018T12:55:57,Vatruvius,Darn...just a few dollars more then you have.
29-03-2018T12:58:14,TheGamePlayer,?
29-03-2018T12:58:20,Vatruvius,Alien Isolation
29-03-2018T12:58:55,TheGamePlayer,oh ya heck no to terrifying
29-03-2018T12:59:33,TheGamePlayer,the movie was bad enough
29-03-2018T13:00:19,Vatruvius,It is so much better then the movies. Trust me...I was to terrified to even watch the movies and this game cured my fear of horror. It will be the best game you every play.
29-03-2018T13:01:23,TheGamePlayer,nope nope nope nope nope nope
29-03-2018T13:02:02,Vatruvius,It is the best game ever...I can not recommend anything in my library over this game.
29-03-2018T13:02:25,TheGamePlayer,too bad nope plus dont have $0
29-03-2018T13:02:34,TheGamePlayer,$40
29-03-2018T13:03:02,Vatruvius,You are missing out...
29-03-2018T13:03:15,TheGamePlayer,good
29-03-2018T13:03:38,Vatruvius,Honestly it is that or the Metro series...I know there is a bundle option where you can buy both games. I own both so I am not sure how much they are charging for the bundle.
29-03-2018T13:04:45,TheGamePlayer,i should stock pile steam cards to invest in a htcvive
29-03-2018T13:04:56,TheGamePlayer,then I could play FO4 vr
29-03-2018T13:05:39,TheGamePlayer,then again i could buy it now and use the oculus back has poor game play
29-03-2018T13:06:12,Vatruvius,As far as I am concerned...VR is cool but really pulls out the fun in games. The system is just not implemented the best. The only thing I would ant to use VR for is as an ultra wide screen which I can just buy an ultra wide monitor.
29-03-2018T13:06:36,Vatruvius,want*
29-03-2018T13:07:42,TheGamePlayer,its actually really cool its like your really there and It helps with the fear of heights but still freaks you out
29-03-2018T13:08:17,Vatruvius,I know...Alien Isolation in VR!
29-03-2018T13:08:22,Vatruvius,:ptv-dealwithit:
29-03-2018T13:08:38,TheGamePlayer,you colud do that but it be hard to see the keyboard
29-03-2018T13:08:50,TheGamePlayer,unless it has controller support
29-03-2018T13:08:57,Vatruvius,I am pretty sure you can play with a controller?
29-03-2018T13:09:55,TheGamePlayer,then youd need to get a oculus and activate the rift core 2.0 app there you can view your desktop in vr and all applications are there too
29-03-2018T13:10:11,Vatruvius,Most simple control scheme every...you can easily use a third party software to let you use a controller.
29-03-2018T13:11:18,TheGamePlayer,like the xbox one software on windows ten
29-03-2018T13:11:42,TheGamePlayer,thats how i record videos
29-03-2018T13:14:59,Vatruvius,You can afford the Metro bundle.
29-03-2018T13:17:53,Vatruvius,Okay...this is just intrusive into my music live. I DO NOT WANT TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR CONDOMS TROJAN! I AM TRYING TO LISTEN TO MUSIC HERE!
29-03-2018T13:18:01,Vatruvius,life*
29-03-2018T13:18:09,TheGamePlayer,???
29-03-2018T13:18:48,TheGamePlayer,uhhh you ok?
29-03-2018T13:19:24,Vatruvius,I am on Spotify for free and Trojan condom commercials have gone rampant being in every commercial break.
29-03-2018T13:19:28,TheGamePlayer,im waiting on my $26.36 from steam support
29-03-2018T13:19:36,TheGamePlayer,XD
29-03-2018T13:20:06,TheGamePlayer,let me suggest listenonrepeat
29-03-2018T13:20:22,TheGamePlayer,add free and useful for playlists
29-03-2018T13:20:36,TheGamePlayer,and its free
29-03-2018T13:21:08,Vatruvius,I got to go do some homework. Should tank me an hour...then I am going out for lunch...then I will go watch the Black Panther in theaters...then I will come back just a few minutes after the stream starts. I might be able to come back before then.
29-03-2018T13:21:27,Vatruvius,take*
29-03-2018T13:21:28,TheGamePlayer,tank?

29-03-2018T14:36:35,RandomTKLover,"There is a stream tonight, right? I only ask because there was one last night. I know the schedule. But also, it’s Good Friday, so I wanted to be sure."
29-03-2018T14:36:52,Twokinds,Probably. We'll have to see what Tom does.
29-03-2018T14:37:48,RandomTKLover,"Ok, good to know."
29-03-2018T15:02:15,Bgrmystr2,xD Tom
29-03-2018T15:15:38,Bigboi182,Hello!
29-03-2018T15:15:54,Bigboi182,Did Tom clear the chat again?
29-03-2018T15:18:46,Bigboi182,I guess so...
29-03-2018T15:19:17,Bigboi182,Since I only see 4 other messages apart from mine...

29-03-2018T15:37:11,Bigboi182,That's OK though.
29-03-2018T16:08:32,Bigboi182,"So, you've just been hanging around the chat as usual, I guess?"
29-03-2018T16:25:43,Bgrmystr2,just woke up an hr ago

29-03-2018T17:21:58,Bgrmystr2,"there's probably dusty air, if I had to guess."
29-03-2018T17:22:09,Bgrmystr2,"maybe, maybe not"
29-03-2018T17:22:21,Bgrmystr2,the mansion may have like.. non-dust magic or whatever..
29-03-2018T17:23:00,Vatruvius,An entire inch of dust on the floor and furniture.
29-03-2018T17:23:09,Bigboi182,OH SHEEEET!

29-03-2018T17:23:54,Bigboi182,I wonder what it's gonna be called...
29-03-2018T17:24:00,Vatruvius,Yup...I figure the April fool page will start of in the 3rd floor room.
29-03-2018T17:24:10,Bigboi182,True.
29-03-2018T17:24:15,Vatruvius,off*
29-03-2018T17:24:24,Twokinds,It's his D&D room.
29-03-2018T17:24:31,Twokinds,He doesn't want anyone to know he was a huge nerd.
29-03-2018T17:24:31,Vatruvius,Noooo!
29-03-2018T17:24:39,Bigboi182,Brilliant.
29-03-2018T17:24:50,Vatruvius,"Wait...that is cool. Magic D&D where the DM, Trace, can actually smite you!"
29-03-2018T17:26:00,Vatruvius,Trace was such a nerd he has meticulously carved figurines of everyone with a carved and painted 3D map...
29-03-2018T17:27:22,Vatruvius,Well...I guess that will be the last we hear of Kiwi for today.
29-03-2018T17:31:43,Bgrmystr2,xD TOm
29-03-2018T17:32:08,BluePhantom90,lol

29-03-2018T18:25:38,Bgrmystr2,Panther sacrifices himself to prevent a nuclear weapon from killing everyone on the planet :V
29-03-2018T18:25:42,Bgrmystr2,that is also a lie
29-03-2018T18:25:50,Bigboi182,That is a lie.
29-03-2018T18:25:51,Bgrmystr2,cuz I haven't seen it xD
29-03-2018T18:26:20,Bigboi182,Well WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH YOUR LIFE?
29-03-2018T18:26:23,Bgrmystr2,"if that's the end for real, Imma be disappoint"
29-03-2018T18:26:32,Bigboi182,That is a good movie.
29-03-2018T18:26:33,Bgrmystr2,I don't care about seeing it really lol
29-03-2018T18:26:37,Bigboi182,Oh.
29-03-2018T18:27:10,Bigboi182,I can tell you that that is not the ending to the movie.
29-03-2018T18:27:13,BluePhantom90,lol
29-03-2018T18:27:23,Bigboi182,"If you know marvel, expect a fight."
29-03-2018T18:27:25,BluePhantom90,go ahead I don't mind spoilers
29-03-2018T18:27:32,Bigboi182,And someone dying.
29-03-2018T18:27:48,Bgrmystr2,Never got into marvel
29-03-2018T18:27:51,Bgrmystr2,or DC really
29-03-2018T18:27:53,Bgrmystr2,or any of that stuff
29-03-2018T18:27:56,Bgrmystr2,meh :u
29-03-2018T18:27:58,Bigboi182,That's fine.
29-03-2018T18:28:19,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, seemed like a bunch of characters that are embodiments of ideals.. which is great, but not realistic"
29-03-2018T18:28:26,Bgrmystr2,so I never got interested
29-03-2018T18:28:49,Bigboi182,And every b-movie Marvel makes is a lead-up to the Avengers.
29-03-2018T18:29:26,Bigboi182,"So if you miss one of them, the rest of the universe is confusing to you."
29-03-2018T18:32:24,Bgrmystr2,"if confusion is what you were expecting, then that's not a problem :P"
29-03-2018T18:33:03,Bgrmystr2,I saw some of the movies.. mostly for the helicarrier
29-03-2018T18:33:05,Bgrmystr2,that thing is badass
29-03-2018T18:33:51,BluePhantom90,I will say one spoiler but its kinda not a big deal to the story.
29-03-2018T18:34:14,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: you know spoilers may not be a big deal to you, but they're a big deal to  other people"
29-03-2018T18:34:50,BluePhantom90,"The Holy Hand grenade in the movie. Your suppose to count to 3, not just throw it"
29-03-2018T18:35:45,BluePhantom90,"well count to 3 then throw, not just throw it after you pull the pin"
29-03-2018T18:37:14,BluePhantom90,that is the only spoiler in the movie I will say
29-03-2018T18:38:38,ZephyrTWolffox,"Bless this thy Holy Handgrenade, that with it thou might blow thine enemies to tiny bits, in thy mercy"

29-03-2018T18:39:40,Bgrmystr2,&gt;.&gt;
29-03-2018T18:39:49,Bgrmystr2,they can never come out good
29-03-2018T18:39:53,Bgrmystr2,in my experience
29-03-2018T18:40:12,BluePhantom90,hmm?
29-03-2018T18:40:43,Bigboi182,I only know the Holy Hand grenade from Worms.
29-03-2018T18:40:49,Bigboi182,I HATED it.
29-03-2018T18:41:14,Bgrmystr2,I don't know where it comes from. I just remember my friend saying that when he would throw a grenade while we'd play coop in Halo
29-03-2018T18:41:37,Bgrmystr2,and every single time it would either stick to something that runs up on us.. or land next to a bunch of grenades on the ground
29-03-2018T18:41:41,Bgrmystr2,and blow us to shit
29-03-2018T18:41:48,Bgrmystr2,every. single. time.
29-03-2018T18:41:53,BluePhantom90,Monty Python man. That is where the joke came from
29-03-2018T18:42:11,Bgrmystr2,"ah yeah, never saw his stuff :u"
29-03-2018T18:42:17,Bgrmystr2,I only saw clips of like.. the bunny
29-03-2018T18:42:37,Bgrmystr2,and the guy with the flesh wound xD
29-03-2018T18:42:48,BluePhantom90,Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Its during the evil rabbit.... OH another sketch idea!
29-03-2018T18:45:00,BluePhantom90,"Either have Flora pounce at Trace while she has bunny Ears on, OR Have Team B do the scene with Flora in the distance as the evil rabbit"
29-03-2018T18:47:55,Bigboi182,"Geez, I have to go visit my cousin for a bit."
29-03-2018T18:48:04,Bigboi182,Nab food from her and stuff...
29-03-2018T18:48:34,Bigboi182,"Bgr, you're in charge of letting me know what goes down if I don't come back in time."
29-03-2018T18:48:44,Bigboi182,Alright?
29-03-2018T18:48:52,BluePhantom90,k
29-03-2018T18:49:14,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
29-03-2018T18:49:22,Bgrmystr2,I did not ask for this level of responsibility
29-03-2018T18:53:53,Bigboi182,Well too bad!

29-03-2018T21:41:00,BluePhantom90,by the rabbit
29-03-2018T21:41:18,Vatruvius,Is Nora magically bounded in any way here Tom...or is there some free will to all of this?
29-03-2018T21:41:44,BluePhantom90,Its just Nora's Fantasy of being over powered.
29-03-2018T21:41:56,aeoronwah,Heya
29-03-2018T21:41:56,BluePhantom90,I take she likes Bondage lol

29-03-2018T21:42:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Aeoron
29-03-2018T21:42:11,Bigboi182,"Anyway, Tom, what are your opinions on a TK style Smash Bros game?"
29-03-2018T21:42:26,Vatruvius,I know it is her fantasy...still want to know if she actually want to be overpowered in her fantasy or make it seem like she it.
29-03-2018T21:42:28,CaptainJack,natani would be op
29-03-2018T21:43:19,Vatruvius,IT'S THE CAVE!
29-03-2018T21:43:25,TheDixieNutjob,a TK style smash bros game...I can dig it
29-03-2018T21:43:30,Vatruvius,"It is here dream during her ""long"" sleep!"
29-03-2018T21:43:41,Bigboi182,Trace would be VERY op...
29-03-2018T21:43:54,Twokinds,Adelaide?
29-03-2018T21:44:03,unsteddyphoenix,Banned from competitive
29-03-2018T21:44:11,Vatruvius,Adelaide has to be a NPC...too much power.
29-03-2018T21:44:11,SageSaga,here's an idea- what if you made it a game- and just- didnt make anyone OP?
29-03-2018T21:44:21,Bigboi182,BANNED. No questions asked.
29-03-2018T21:44:22,unsteddyphoenix,Your friends all get mad at you when you pick Adeladie
29-03-2018T21:44:26,CaptainJack,adelaides special move would be carriage throw
29-03-2018T21:44:29,Vatruvius,Or make a game where everyone is OP?
29-03-2018T21:44:31,aeoronwah,I feel like there would have to be multiple versions of trace
29-03-2018T21:44:36,Bigboi182,"Then it would be boring, Sage..."
29-03-2018T21:44:53,SageSaga,oh you are so right- a balanced game is never fun
29-03-2018T21:45:01,ZRO4825,:thinking:
29-03-2018T21:45:18,CaptainJack,kinda why tanks are fun in rpg games
29-03-2018T21:45:19,Bgrmystr2,Extra stage is still fun even if it's IMBA as hell
29-03-2018T21:45:22,Notgoingtopostanything1,Nora dreaming that she’s the damsel in destress and her hero trace is hear to save her
29-03-2018T21:45:34,ZRO4825,RAN-SAMAAAAAA ;_;
29-03-2018T21:45:36,ItsActuallyKopyKat,...sure... yeah... that's it
29-03-2018T21:45:41,Bgrmystr2,poor zro xD
29-03-2018T21:46:02,TheDixieNutjob,and why people complain about Russian bias in Warthunder and any Wargaming title that has Russian stuff as playable
29-03-2018T21:46:21,Ordithus,What would Kat's moves be in such a game?
29-03-2018T21:46:29,ZRO4825,They complain about Russian bias because the Russian stuff is stronger than other stuff in a Russian-made game &lt;_&lt;;
29-03-2018T21:46:38,Vatruvius,Seduce? Massage?
29-03-2018T21:46:38,TheDixieNutjob,exactly
29-03-2018T21:46:43,ZRO4825,Or was that a different game? :thinking: Hard to keep track of all of'em.
29-03-2018T21:46:52,TheDixieNutjob,no no you're correct
29-03-2018T21:46:56,Twokinds,Her block could be called 'rejection'
29-03-2018T21:47:05,Vatruvius,Oh my...ouch.
29-03-2018T21:47:10,Vatruvius,Kat rejection the worst.
29-03-2018T21:47:12,Notgoingtopostanything1,Is that those mana crystal
29-03-2018T21:47:12,Bgrmystr2,"ow, Tom"
29-03-2018T21:47:17,Bigboi182,Damn.
29-03-2018T21:47:24,Bigboi182,That would work...
29-03-2018T21:47:26,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-katwet:
29-03-2018T21:47:32,TheDixieNutjob,what would be her final smash? or are we going with the Melee and earlier versions of smash bros?
29-03-2018T21:47:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,does she shout out Rejection like Phoenix Wright
29-03-2018T21:47:52,Bigboi182,XD Marv
29-03-2018T21:48:04,Bigboi182,That would be awesome.

29-03-2018T21:48:31,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-LauraCry:
29-03-2018T21:48:34,Bigboi182,Trace would have a very awesome final smash.
29-03-2018T21:48:41,NightMeaty22,i am not going to see ready player 1
29-03-2018T21:48:51,Bigboi182,But no one uses a final smash...
29-03-2018T21:49:09,CrRAR,ooo distant light
29-03-2018T21:49:10,ZRO4825,Pretty sure I use them :thinking:
29-03-2018T21:49:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Trace uses Texas Smash
29-03-2018T21:49:14,Bigboi182,You can always see it tomorrow.
29-03-2018T21:49:18,Bgrmystr2,zro is noone confirmed
29-03-2018T21:49:19,Notgoingtopostanything1,That’s not bad
29-03-2018T21:49:19,unsteddyphoenix,I think Trace is gonna have a final smash in this pic
29-03-2018T21:49:23,CaptainJack,what why not?
29-03-2018T21:49:31,Ordithus,lol unsteddy

29-03-2018T21:50:00,Notgoingtopostanything1,Undertale
29-03-2018T21:50:02,TheDixieNutjob,I was thinking Trace would use a massive magical hyperbeam instead of Texas Smash
29-03-2018T21:50:04,Bigboi182,"Trace would use his dark powers to engulf his enemy, an instant k.o."

29-03-2018T21:50:23,Combak,"Woah, look at all the light!"
29-03-2018T21:50:24,TheDixieNutjob,Natani would be Texas Smash
29-03-2018T21:50:33,unsteddyphoenix,"DEFINTELY didnt say tha', did not say tha'..."
29-03-2018T21:50:46,CrRAR,haha
29-03-2018T21:50:49,ZRO4825,Texas can't Smash. Texas usually IS smashed.
29-03-2018T21:50:53,Combak,"Is that a giant crystal, or the exit to the cave? The world may never know!"
29-03-2018T21:50:57,Ordithus,"It was pretty tame, as far as we go"
29-03-2018T21:50:59,Bigboi182,@Notgoingtopostanything1 why do I feel like I've seen you somewhere before...

29-03-2018T22:04:20,Notgoingtopostanything1,Two kinds is probably looking at the side of his screen thinking wtf
29-03-2018T22:04:42,Vatruvius,Nah...I think this is pretty normal for Tom to see.
29-03-2018T22:04:43,SageSaga,why do you keep putting a space inbetween twokinds?
29-03-2018T22:04:49,Twokinds,I don't read the comments

29-03-2018T22:22:24,Ordithus,"Nero's faces are spectacular.  Tom, learn from this master!"
29-03-2018T22:22:24,Vatruvius,:ptv-shock:
29-03-2018T22:22:28,Tharkis,"also, if you cant afford to tip at least 20% dont eat out, that's my rule.  a 20% tip is baseline minimum for me, cause waitstaff makes jack"
29-03-2018T22:22:29,Bigboi182,If 3rd was that bad.
29-03-2018T22:22:42,Bgrmystr2,"So.. zro, you guys get mandatory tips or whatnot as a % of the cost, right?"
29-03-2018T22:22:46,ZRO4825,Nope.
29-03-2018T22:22:47,Bgrmystr2,because you deliver?
29-03-2018T22:22:50,Bgrmystr2,really?
29-03-2018T22:22:53,ZRO4825,really
29-03-2018T22:22:54,Bigboi182,wow.
29-03-2018T22:22:56,SageSaga,the second worse was when they tried to throw me under a bus by claiming i magically stole a credit card from the owners wife to pay for something for the hotel-
29-03-2018T22:23:03,Notgoingtopostanything1,What are you doing all of you
29-03-2018T22:23:05,Tharkis,"nope, tipped workers get @#%@%@#ed over in america"
29-03-2018T22:23:14,Bigboi182,Wha- How?
29-03-2018T22:23:19,ZRO4825,I make like 27 cents per mile. That's it. And my pay gets dropped to below minimum wage while I'm out on the road as well.
29-03-2018T22:23:24,unsteddyphoenix,Always magically steal cash kids
29-03-2018T22:23:26,Bigboi182,How does that work Sage.
29-03-2018T22:23:27,SageSaga,the first was when we had a crazy woman who almost burned the place down keeping the terrorist and ghosts away
29-03-2018T22:23:27,ZRO4825,"hourly pay, that is*"
29-03-2018T22:23:41,Tharkis,"on a slow night, a tipped worker's wages can actually fall such that they owe money for working"
29-03-2018T22:23:41,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds familiar..
29-03-2018T22:23:44,TheFDdriver,how does that happen to y'all in the first place
29-03-2018T22:23:50,Bigboi182,Now she was just paranoid.
29-03-2018T22:23:52,Tharkis,that's why no one wants to work monday nights in the food service industry
29-03-2018T22:23:55,Bgrmystr2,"far as I recall, a few businesses around here charge extra for the price so the people get their tips in the price"
29-03-2018T22:24:04,Bigboi182,And you just happened to be there...
29-03-2018T22:24:14,ZRO4825,Oh the business charges extra for delivery....but it isn't going to ME
29-03-2018T22:24:19,Ordithus,Uhh... isn't minimum wage still the minimum any worker can legally make?
29-03-2018T22:24:22,Tharkis,nope
29-03-2018T22:24:23,Ordithus,Tips or no?
29-03-2018T22:24:27,w0lfmare,:cw0lfmare-EmberShock::cw0lfmare-EmberShock::cw0lfmare-EmberShock:
29-03-2018T22:24:31,Ordithus,Must be a Minnesota thing...
29-03-2018T22:24:33,SageSaga,the cops asked her to leave instead of taking her away- and she came back with a gas can
29-03-2018T22:24:34,unsteddyphoenix,ayo w0lf
29-03-2018T22:24:35,Ordithus,Hi w0lf!
29-03-2018T22:24:36,CrRAR,yo w0lf
29-03-2018T22:24:37,Bgrmystr2,"yeh but that's not the same as charging for the tip as well, zro xD"
29-03-2018T22:24:40,Bigboi182,Sup Wolf!
29-03-2018T22:24:40,Sammit,HI W0lf
29-03-2018T22:24:41,Tharkis,some states have their own laws
29-03-2018T22:24:42,FoxxTrotter,"E'lo, w0lf. :0)"
29-03-2018T22:24:48,ZRO4825,"Yes Ord, but the companies make us report our tips to make it look like we're making minimum wage, whether we are or not."
29-03-2018T22:24:52,Twokinds,Hoy w0lf!
29-03-2018T22:24:54,TheFDdriver,hello w0lf
29-03-2018T22:24:59,ZRO4825,Heyyo W0lfmare ^_^

29-03-2018T22:25:07,Bgrmystr2,heya w0lf :D
29-03-2018T22:25:10,Ordithus,@ZRO4825 :ctwokinds-renirawr:
29-03-2018T22:25:24,ZRO4825,And now you know why your pizza drivers are irritable when they don't get tipped.
29-03-2018T22:25:29,Bigboi182,"Hoy W0lf, Welcome to the Tem Shop!"
29-03-2018T22:25:29,w0lfmare,Hello hello
29-03-2018T22:25:32,Tharkis,had a friend who worked as a bartender for a while who finally quit and vowed to never do it again after a particularly bad week
29-03-2018T22:25:36,neropan,heyo
29-03-2018T22:25:36,Combak,Hi W0lf!
29-03-2018T22:25:37,Vatruvius,"It is the law that waiters and waitresses make at least minimum wage, if not from tips then the business is suppose to subsidy it. Unfortunately...not many people know that and it is very poorly enforced."
29-03-2018T22:25:41,Bigboi182,Do you have any muns?
29-03-2018T22:25:46,Tharkis,"he worked 35 hours, and at the end of the week he owed 20$"
29-03-2018T22:25:53,Tharkis,his check for 35 hours of work was a bill
29-03-2018T22:26:00,Ordithus,How even
29-03-2018T22:26:01,Notgoingtopostanything1,Hi wolf
29-03-2018T22:26:02,Tharkis,because his pay didnt cover his healthcare
29-03-2018T22:26:11,Ordithus,Oh... damn
29-03-2018T22:26:12,CrRAR,aww hell naw
29-03-2018T22:26:16,Bigboi182,Wow.
29-03-2018T22:26:21,Bigboi182,That sucks.
29-03-2018T22:26:27,TheFDdriver,indeed
29-03-2018T22:26:28,ZRO4825,"Now that being said, I personally can't complain, as I usually make MORE than enough to cover minimum wage plus some, in spite of the non-tippers."
29-03-2018T22:26:38,Bigboi182,THe shading struggle...
29-03-2018T22:26:39,ZRO4825,But if  a day is particularly bad? I end up spending more in gas than I made in tips.
29-03-2018T22:26:45,Tharkis,yep
29-03-2018T22:26:48,Tharkis,it's @%@% stupid
29-03-2018T22:26:51,Notgoingtopostanything1,I forgot two kinds name agen
29-03-2018T22:27:02,Combak,Tom?
29-03-2018T22:27:09,Notgoingtopostanything1,Ok thanks
29-03-2018T22:27:12,ZRO4825,No Toms here. We lost the last one.
29-03-2018T22:27:20,Bgrmystr2,"I'd tell them shove their bill up their ass, Thark. Theyr'e supposed to pay him, not bill him for working for them."
29-03-2018T22:27:20,ZRO4825,There's this Twokinds guy though...
29-03-2018T22:27:41,Vatruvius,Yeah...the last Tom spiraled down into drawing furries.
29-03-2018T22:27:41,ZRO4825,"Sadly, Bgr, they make sure you sign papers when you get hired saying you agree to the pay model..."
29-03-2018T22:27:49,Bigboi182,XD
29-03-2018T22:28:21,Ordithus,"Law trumps contracts, but a crappy paying job is better than no job... :ptv-sad:"
29-03-2018T22:28:35,Bgrmystr2,"fairly certain if you work for someone, and they don't pay you for the job, and instead send you a bill, that's a legal problem right there."
29-03-2018T22:28:36,ZRO4825,Except for when your job isn't paying you and is charging you to do  your job.
29-03-2018T22:28:55,Clippy,isnt that called slavery?
29-03-2018T22:29:11,Vatruvius,It would be yes.
29-03-2018T22:29:28,Notgoingtopostanything1,What country do you live in
29-03-2018T22:29:38,ZRO4825,Slaves had it better in some regards. At least your masters were supposed to feed/clothe/shelter you. Businesses aren't obligated to bother. :joy:
29-03-2018T22:29:48,Bgrmystr2,xD Zro
29-03-2018T22:29:51,SageSaga,Zro- im gonna delete that

29-03-2018T22:31:08,SageSaga,i wont have someone comparing a crap job to people being property
29-03-2018T22:31:21,unsteddyphoenix,He just wont have it
29-03-2018T22:31:22,Vatruvius,I agree with you there Sage.
29-03-2018T22:31:23,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-nibsdance: good move
29-03-2018T22:31:25,Bigboi182,That is two different things.
29-03-2018T22:31:40,Bigboi182,That is crossing the line a bit.
29-03-2018T22:31:48,unsteddyphoenix,Depends whether or not youre talking to a libertarian
29-03-2018T22:31:53,Vatruvius,I was wondering what felt off about this color and it hit me...the white Trace.
29-03-2018T22:32:03,Bigboi182,What?
29-03-2018T22:32:30,Bigboi182,"Wait, what is that on the ground?"
29-03-2018T22:32:34,Combak,Trace still hasn't been colored.
29-03-2018T22:32:37,unsteddyphoenix,thats trace
29-03-2018T22:32:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,thought that was rose
29-03-2018T22:32:58,Bigboi182,"No, by her foot..."
29-03-2018T22:33:08,Bgrmystr2,Secret nibbly
29-03-2018T22:33:09,unsteddyphoenix,Nora is also on the ground
29-03-2018T22:33:18,Vatruvius,I think you are talking about the light from the crystal...Tom removed the crystal temporarily.

29-03-2018T22:34:32,Ordithus,It's probably something to do with the layers in the picture
29-03-2018T22:34:34,Vatruvius,We have established this...in the Twokinds' world only Tom physics apply.
29-03-2018T22:34:48,Ordithus,"Or something about ""working on it"""
29-03-2018T22:35:05,Bgrmystr2,"Not enough people understand physics in a realistic sense that it's a legitimate reasoning, phoenix"
29-03-2018T22:35:10,Bgrmystr2,unfortunately.

29-03-2018T22:36:41,Vatruvius,Also...I went to it in time and it is not allowed in the US
29-03-2018T22:36:50,ZRO4825,Have been all the time on fridays.
29-03-2018T22:36:52,TheFDdriver,you have to ask if i am correct
29-03-2018T22:36:54,Notgoingtopostanything1,Pressed return on accident
29-03-2018T22:36:57,Bigboi182,Ok... I'll roll with it.
29-03-2018T22:37:03,Vatruvius,There are no links in Sage's chat. This is a multistream chat.
29-03-2018T22:37:04,Bgrmystr2,Every friday has been sage's rules
29-03-2018T22:37:12,Bgrmystr2,sage is the host lol
29-03-2018T22:37:13,Bigboi182,Oh...
29-03-2018T22:37:39,SageSaga,they are because trolls tried to give people viruses when we started- thus the rule is to protect people
29-03-2018T22:37:42,Vatruvius,How did I learn this before you when you have been here for months more than me Bigboi!?
29-03-2018T22:37:57,Bigboi182,And Sage has something against links...
29-03-2018T22:38:10,SageSaga,Did you hear what i just said?
29-03-2018T22:38:13,Vatruvius,Ohh...that makes sense Sage. Thought it was mostly preference but I am glad you are looking out for us.
29-03-2018T22:38:20,Bigboi182,"I never put IN a link, so i never knew..."
29-03-2018T22:38:22,TheFDdriver,you can ask him
29-03-2018T22:38:37,Notgoingtopostanything1,Protection is better
29-03-2018T22:38:39,Bgrmystr2,"you don't need to put in a link and have it removed to know, Big"
29-03-2018T22:38:40,Bigboi182,But that's fine...
29-03-2018T22:38:46,Bgrmystr2,I knew before I ever put in a link too
29-03-2018T22:38:47,Bgrmystr2,so..
29-03-2018T22:38:49,Ordithus,"Links to the streamers' stuff is ok, as long as the URL is obvious"

29-03-2018T22:39:09,Bgrmystr2,"yeah unlike others, I tend to bother actually reading what happens in the chat"
29-03-2018T22:39:14,Bigboi182,I didn't see anybody do it either...
29-03-2018T22:39:14,Bgrmystr2,and pay attention to stuff
29-03-2018T22:39:28,SageSaga,yeah if you link to Toms stuff or my stuff- so long as the link obviously goes to one of our official sites its ok without asking permission
29-03-2018T22:39:32,ZRO4825,We are all very sneaky around here.
29-03-2018T22:39:35,SageSaga,and Neros stuff too

29-03-2018T23:16:16,SageSaga,it's easy to fix a lot of it- the problem is the writer just stole so much XD
29-03-2018T23:16:17,Zakuru,i would've died
29-03-2018T23:16:25,Combak,"However, SAO:A is pretty good."

29-03-2018T23:17:36,SageSaga,why would i stop? SAO has a great concept- but it's ruined by terrible writing as soon as it stopped copying Arc

29-03-2018T23:21:11,Bgrmystr2,SAO was not
29-03-2018T23:21:32,SageSaga,no -Konosuba was a parody
29-03-2018T23:21:50,unsteddyphoenix,konosuba top tier
29-03-2018T23:22:07,SageSaga,calling something a Parody does not save it from being terrible
29-03-2018T23:22:15,Bgrmystr2,One being a parody does not make the other not a parody. :thinking:
29-03-2018T23:22:37,Bgrmystr2,but that is true
29-03-2018T23:23:08,CaptainJack,brb my fried chicken is being fried a little to much
29-03-2018T23:23:10,SageSaga,if you fail at making something entertaining and not even able to make fun of the thing it wants to- its not a parody - it's just bad
29-03-2018T23:23:12,darkzoned,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

29-03-2018T23:24:43,SageSaga,Log Horizon was solid- but needed more- and Overlord has been great
29-03-2018T23:24:50,TheFDdriver,"its this supposed to be private, theres holes on the roof then Flora would spy"
29-03-2018T23:24:55,Vatruvius,I am back...did you guys miss me?

29-03-2018T23:26:02,Vatruvius,Perfect emoji! :ptv-victory:
29-03-2018T23:26:13,McClaw,I'm reading the translations of Overlord.
29-03-2018T23:26:46,TheFDdriver,i dont like reading its boring
29-03-2018T23:27:06,McClaw,"There's the light novels, the manga, and the anime."
29-03-2018T23:27:11,SageSaga,im sorry to hear you are illiterate
29-03-2018T23:27:15,Vatruvius,Alright...I will admit it...not into anime...but my sister is and refuses to read Twokinds. Anything you anime fans really like about the comic that I could tell my sister to start reading it?
29-03-2018T23:27:29,McClaw,Catgirls. :P
29-03-2018T23:27:36,unsteddyphoenix,I like that it's not an anime
29-03-2018T23:27:46,Bgrmystr2,Refuses to read it? But why?
29-03-2018T23:28:11,McClaw,"Vatruvius, does your sister read manga, too?"
29-03-2018T23:28:14,Bgrmystr2,"Also, I like that it has an interesting story :u"
29-03-2018T23:28:19,TheFDdriver,its something that i was thought in a boring way
29-03-2018T23:28:39,TheFDdriver,thats probably why
29-03-2018T23:29:07,Ordithus,The characters are quite good too
29-03-2018T23:29:37,SageSaga,Tell her if she doesnt read it then you will tell your parents she ordered the Markiplier Tasteful Nudes calendar - and when she said she didnt show her the receipt of it that you ordered using her name
29-03-2018T23:29:55,Bgrmystr2,XD

29-03-2018T23:55:48,Bgrmystr2,"Sage, I have a question. Do you upload the HD comics to your patreon or whatever? :ptv-wondering:"
29-03-2018T23:56:37,SageSaga,why would i upload the HD versions when the regular versions are already rather big?
29-03-2018T23:56:48,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: are they?
29-03-2018T23:57:34,SageSaga,the AI pages are 792x1224
29-03-2018T23:57:54,Vatruvius,Ah...ha. Not 4k then Sage!
29-03-2018T23:57:59,SageSaga,they are just under 2MB each
29-03-2018T23:58:19,Bgrmystr2,"yeh I was gonna say it's not too big. I guess that's not bad though, thinking about it"
29-03-2018T23:58:27,SageSaga,and if i gave people the full res versions then why would they buy the book if they could print their own?
29-03-2018T23:58:48,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: To have a physical copy
29-03-2018T23:58:50,Vatruvius,Hmm...my 4K desktop wallpaper is only 1MB
29-03-2018T23:58:56,MagicEnchilladas,the cost of ink
29-03-2018T23:58:59,Ordithus,"Also, Mihari might kill you if you did that"
29-03-2018T23:58:59,Bgrmystr2,"jpg prolly, Vatru"
29-03-2018T23:59:00,SageSaga,i just said- they could print their own-
29-03-2018T23:59:17,Vatruvius,.jpg saves space?
29-03-2018T23:59:23,Ordithus,"Tons, Batru"
29-03-2018T23:59:25,SageSaga,who uses Jpg?
29-03-2018T23:59:25,Ordithus,*Vatru
29-03-2018T23:59:32,Bgrmystr2,"jpg saves space yeah, but also isn't as high quality, Vatru"
29-03-2018T23:59:40,ZRO4825,.png ftw
