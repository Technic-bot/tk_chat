19-10-2018T01:42:55,Bgrmystr2,it feels like youve embiggened the butts a bit more than usual
19-10-2018T01:43:10,SageSaga,nope
19-10-2018T01:43:47,SageSaga,Kaylins looks bigger because of the pants pushing her butt cheeks up
19-10-2018T01:44:31,JamesBSquirrel3,hhhmm - no comment for those two
19-10-2018T01:44:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"gotta get those cheeks up, thems rookie cheeks"
19-10-2018T01:44:47,ZRO4825,Me likies ^_^
19-10-2018T01:45:17,BadFoMo,"Is it just me, or is Kaylin's right foor in the first pic look inflated?"
19-10-2018T01:45:32,ZRO4825,"idk, can't see her feet :o"
19-10-2018T01:46:17,SageSaga,hmm - i think i see it a little bit- i can fix that
19-10-2018T01:46:40,ZRO4825,"Ahh, yeah"
19-10-2018T01:46:41,sunblaze,sorry came back from japan on tuesday and still a bit groggy
19-10-2018T01:46:50,sunblaze,writing the request now. jsut a sec
19-10-2018T01:46:53,SageSaga,wb from Japan!
19-10-2018T01:46:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,how was the trip?
19-10-2018T01:47:32,JamesBSquirrel3,Sunblaze is back?!?:ptv-shock:
19-10-2018T01:47:33,sunblaze,marvelous except for serious backpain on my sister that bound her to the flat for 2 days and 2 typhoons above our head :P
19-10-2018T01:47:41,sunblaze,fun times
19-10-2018T01:48:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"well, that does sound like an adventure"
19-10-2018T01:48:16,sunblaze,nevertheless we managed to sightsee most important things and I am hugely satisfied
19-10-2018T01:48:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Thats good
19-10-2018T01:50:04,sunblaze,btw wuld totally buy thise 2 snuggly pillows :D
19-10-2018T01:50:23,JamesBSquirrel3,:ptv-laugh:
19-10-2018T01:50:36,SageSaga,alright- thats 2 and a maybe
19-10-2018T01:51:16,ZRO4825,"Any idea what kind price range you're lookin at, Sage? And is there a possibility of a Toyoko? :P"
19-10-2018T01:51:17,SageSaga,i gotta figure out how to do preorders- but Paypal has a rule about Preorders needing to be delivered within 30 days of the order
19-10-2018T01:51:30,sunblaze,really? thats strange
19-10-2018T01:51:43,SageSaga,"im thinking 60 each, or 100 for both of them"
19-10-2018T01:51:44,Bgrmystr2,that sounds really strange considering that's not how preorders work at all
19-10-2018T01:52:05,Bgrmystr2,preoders being that.. they're not actually on the shelf or available for sometimes long periods of time
19-10-2018T01:52:19,SageSaga,its because Paypal has issues with disputes past a month
19-10-2018T01:52:28,Bgrmystr2,hm
19-10-2018T01:52:36,Bgrmystr2,well how did fluff do it
19-10-2018T01:52:43,Bgrmystr2,cuz that I don't recall
19-10-2018T01:53:03,Bgrmystr2,"I know he did it, but don't really recall or know specifics"
19-10-2018T01:53:26,SageSaga,i just asked him- but the Paypal thing was added recently - like within 6 months
19-10-2018T01:53:33,ZRO4825,Bleh
19-10-2018T01:53:49,Bgrmystr2,ah rip
19-10-2018T01:53:56,SageSaga,i might have to kickstarter?
19-10-2018T01:55:00,ZRO4825,:thinking:
19-10-2018T01:55:36,SageSaga,if sales go well and i can afford to pay for stock of others i would certainly make more

19-10-2018T15:34:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"burn baby burn, disco inferno"
19-10-2018T15:34:45,CatzArt,"no prairies, like in grasslands. we were conducting a prescribed burn to remove invasive plants that were crowding out native vegitation."
19-10-2018T15:34:53,Tharkis,"i failed to make my stream suggestion spoopy , but it got 4th place in voting so i resubmitted last week's .   I mean it could be made spoopy easy enough"
19-10-2018T15:35:34,Bgrmystr2,darn those plants.. growing naturally where nature put them even though they clearly have no right to be there :v
19-10-2018T15:35:56,KeithKeiser,Burn em
19-10-2018T15:36:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I'm doing the same tharkis, mine got 3rd last week"
19-10-2018T15:36:22,Bgrmystr2,:fire::seedling::fire:
19-10-2018T15:36:36,CatzArt,that i did and Ow-O will suffice keith.
19-10-2018T15:36:50,KeithKeiser,"Gunna need more fire, use volcano 🌋"
19-10-2018T15:37:13,Bgrmystr2,"that's too much fire, gonna need you to tone it down"
19-10-2018T15:37:23,Bgrmystr2,jus a lil
19-10-2018T15:37:25,KeithKeiser,🌋🌋🌋
19-10-2018T15:37:31,Bgrmystr2,Dx no
19-10-2018T15:37:40,CatzArt,we had drip torches and flares. however the forest service has guns that fire magnesium filled pingpong balls
19-10-2018T15:38:27,Bgrmystr2,guess I'm gonna go make food
19-10-2018T15:38:39,Corinthian,Yo
19-10-2018T15:38:39,CatzArt,they shoot them from helicopters or use the terra torches (glorified flamethrowers) from the backs of trucks.
19-10-2018T15:38:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Corin
19-10-2018T15:38:58,CatzArt,hey corn
19-10-2018T15:39:37,Corinthian,Man Tom draws amazing landscapes.
19-10-2018T15:40:02,CatzArt,yeah he does. mine always look flat.
19-10-2018T15:40:23,KeithKeiser,Green grass and blue sky never hurt no-one
19-10-2018T15:40:53,CatzArt,except grass can burn and fire hurts people. so grass can hurt you
19-10-2018T15:41:03,KeithKeiser,😢
19-10-2018T15:41:28,CatzArt,and some people are deathly allergic to grass and that can kill you.
19-10-2018T15:41:39,KeithKeiser,:ptv-confused:
19-10-2018T15:42:19,CatzArt,the world is a scary place where everything can kill you. now never leave your room again for fear of death by everyday objects
19-10-2018T15:42:43,KeithKeiser,Usually how I spend my days anyways
19-10-2018T15:43:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Eh most of my fond memories where out side, so I'll risk it for a biscuit"
19-10-2018T15:44:23,andrewfr8man,"That which does not kill me only prolongs the inevitable. Something will get me eventually, and when it does, I want to be sure I've not lived in fear of all that which could have done me in before."
19-10-2018T15:44:32,CatzArt,true marv. I like being outside. heck i literally play with fire as part of my classes.
19-10-2018T15:44:37,andrewfr8man,"In my line of work, a healthy relationship with the reaper is required."
19-10-2018T15:44:57,andrewfr8man,Healthy respect.
19-10-2018T15:45:26,CatzArt,in what line of work? law enforcement?
19-10-2018T15:45:42,CrRAR,♫ Baby don't feear the reaper ♫
19-10-2018T15:45:55,andrewfr8man,Professional pilot.
19-10-2018T15:46:25,CatzArt,ah. I my best friend is an aerospace engineer.
19-10-2018T15:46:34,CatzArt,small world
19-10-2018T15:46:50,CrRAR,how magical
19-10-2018T15:47:40,andrewfr8man,Indeed.
19-10-2018T15:47:54,CatzArt,still being a professional pilot is hard since you have to build up your flight hours to get a better job with better pay and it takes alot of money to get there
19-10-2018T15:48:02,Dunkoro,"wait, what's the other stream I'm seeing"
19-10-2018T15:48:22,andrewfr8man,"Incredibly expensive, exhausting, and most often, rewarding at the end of the day."
19-10-2018T15:48:25,CatzArt,the one on the right or left?
19-10-2018T15:48:30,Dunkoro,the one on the right
19-10-2018T15:48:59,CatzArt,Toms streamed with them before but i dont remember the name
19-10-2018T15:49:11,andrewfr8man,SageSaga.
19-10-2018T15:49:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Thts Sage
19-10-2018T15:49:16,andrewfr8man,I believe.
19-10-2018T15:49:32,Dunkoro,"well it's called SageSaga, the question should probably be *why am I seeing that stream*, is it a Picarto thing where you stream together with someone else?"
19-10-2018T15:49:52,totallynotTrace,its how Tom set it up
19-10-2018T15:49:58,SageSaga,=_=
19-10-2018T15:50:02,totallynotTrace,and sage
19-10-2018T15:50:26,SageSaga,Tom joined my stream today- i normally stream Friday and Saturdays
19-10-2018T15:50:39,CatzArt,at least with the pilot shortage you wont be out of work andrew. In my Natural Resources field Trump keeps taking our funding. cant do research or fight wildfires without funding.
19-10-2018T15:51:19,CatzArt,so california can burn for a bit till we get our funding back.
19-10-2018T15:51:52,TheN1ghtFre4k,Greetings

19-10-2018T16:00:15,KeithKeiser,Keys
19-10-2018T16:00:40,CatzArt,yes she has the teleport key.
19-10-2018T16:01:17,KeithKeiser,"Bet she loses her keys, she seems clumsy, like when she said about traces door"
19-10-2018T16:01:33,totallynotTrace,if only the paid sketch of her having a Wabajack were cannon
19-10-2018T16:01:51,totallynotTrace,should say patreon sketch
19-10-2018T16:02:04,CatzArt,and I think we might get through a picture without tom(Jason) shaking the image and giving the twokinds world a magnitude 5 earthquake.
19-10-2018T16:02:31,TheN1ghtFre4k,:cthen1ghtfre4k-bioniclematorans:
