25-02-2018T00:01:25,Dadrobit,"It's long, but it works for me"
25-02-2018T00:02:56,unsteddyphoenix,RELENTLESSLY
25-02-2018T00:03:24,Dadrobit,R E L E N T L E S S L Y

25-02-2018T00:06:25,TheBeckoner,acquired a salad
25-02-2018T00:07:13,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:
25-02-2018T00:10:16,TheBeckoner,Wot you starin at?
25-02-2018T00:10:32,TheBeckoner,has completely consumed the salad.
25-02-2018T00:11:10,Twokinds,I did read the script
25-02-2018T00:11:19,Twokinds,I'd have to compile my thoughts about it
25-02-2018T00:11:43,SpazztasticKiwi,An answer rises from the void
25-02-2018T00:11:43,BadFoMo,What script?
25-02-2018T00:11:57,unsteddyphoenix,"Fair, it's pretty long..."
25-02-2018T00:13:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"It took you like 4 minutes to eat that salad? Dude, slow down"
25-02-2018T00:13:28,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
25-02-2018T00:13:32,BadFoMo,"@Twokinds Also, hate to nag, but have you given any further thoughts on the Papercraft idea?"
25-02-2018T00:13:35,unsteddyphoenix,SUCH SPEED
25-02-2018T00:14:00,unsteddyphoenix,"Papercraft? is that like, cutouts?"
25-02-2018T00:14:04,Twokinds,"Uh, I don't know about papercraft"
25-02-2018T00:14:12,BadFoMo,@unsteddyphoenix Yes.
25-02-2018T00:14:30,TheBeckoner,twas a good salad.
25-02-2018T00:14:57,unsteddyphoenix,Hm
25-02-2018T00:15:03,TheBeckoner,has left to shower.
25-02-2018T00:15:03,unsteddyphoenix,Ive heard legends about such beasts
25-02-2018T00:15:11,TheBeckoner,maybe I can do that in 4 mins too...
25-02-2018T00:15:16,unsteddyphoenix,Speedrun
25-02-2018T00:15:24,TheBeckoner,okstartnow
25-02-2018T00:15:32,Twokinds,I feel like the script is a bit.. how shall I say... one note
25-02-2018T00:16:43,Twokinds,And it feels as though the whole story is written to make the ending work.
25-02-2018T00:17:11,SpazztasticKiwi,...someone say paper craft?
25-02-2018T00:17:15,unsteddyphoenix,Hmm...
25-02-2018T00:17:33,unsteddyphoenix,"I suppose that is sort of true, the whole thing is building up to it."
25-02-2018T00:17:51,BadFoMo,"@SpazztasticKiwi Yeh, but it sounds like it might not happen."
25-02-2018T00:17:59,BadFoMo,*Yeah
25-02-2018T00:20:40,unsteddyphoenix,I guess I thought a sort of...straight-forward story  would work as a bit of fluff.
25-02-2018T00:21:29,TheBeckoner,Dang. Took me 6 mins...
25-02-2018T00:21:40,unsteddyphoenix,Not good enough!
25-02-2018T00:21:44,Twokinds,"I just feel like like, with pixie panic 2, there should be a lot of interesting stuff going on"
25-02-2018T00:22:04,Twokinds,"And... well... ""everyone's a girl!"" is... well, it's just one thing..."
25-02-2018T00:22:11,Dadrobit,continues to procrastinate on his own work.
25-02-2018T00:22:38,unsteddyphoenix,"True, I did struggle about the transformations."
25-02-2018T00:23:23,unsteddyphoenix,I figured the actual girls would have...something...happen to them
25-02-2018T00:23:52,unsteddyphoenix,But yeah when it came to that I was really uncreative i'll admit lol.
25-02-2018T00:24:01,BadFoMo,"...Well, I might have ""an idea"" that ""might"" aid the story."
25-02-2018T00:24:54,Twokinds,"When I think ""queen of the pixies"" I'm sorta thinking ""siren"""
25-02-2018T00:25:10,BadFoMo,Siren?
25-02-2018T00:25:16,Dadrobit,0.o
25-02-2018T00:25:25,unsteddyphoenix,Like...merfolk?
25-02-2018T00:25:33,TheBeckoner,singy singy killy killy fish people right?
25-02-2018T00:25:50,BadFoMo,"Oh, thoes."
25-02-2018T00:25:55,unsteddyphoenix,Or perhaps in the less literal sense
25-02-2018T00:25:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Brilliant description
25-02-2018T00:26:10,TheBeckoner,am simpl boi
25-02-2018T00:27:13,Twokinds,"Yeah not literally a merefolk, but like, a unique aquatic humanoid creature that ensnares men"
25-02-2018T00:27:23,Twokinds,Kinda the reverse of what you wrote honestly XD
25-02-2018T00:27:44,unsteddyphoenix,Haha
25-02-2018T00:28:13,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah that's unfortunate~
25-02-2018T00:28:17,unsteddyphoenix,But I see
25-02-2018T00:30:19,unsteddyphoenix,"Ok, i'll take that into consideration if I try again."
25-02-2018T00:30:23,Twokinds,Sorry I can tell it was a lot of work. I just feel like there should be more interesting stuff.
25-02-2018T00:31:03,unsteddyphoenix,Nah dont worry about it. I wanted to try something out of my element.
25-02-2018T00:32:08,Bgrmystr2,learning experiences are always valuable
25-02-2018T00:32:13,Twokinds,"Pixie Panic was really just an excuse to have all the characters go through a bunch of weird magical stuff. I think if I were to make a sequel, it'd need to fulfill a similiar purpose."
25-02-2018T00:32:16,Twokinds,If that makes sense.
25-02-2018T00:32:34,SpazztasticKiwi,ü§î
25-02-2018T00:32:42,unsteddyphoenix,"And I kind of put that in the back seat yeah, it makes sense."
25-02-2018T00:33:21,Twokinds,"Having a different plot and setting is good, but at least for me, I like having fun stuff going on throughout."
25-02-2018T00:33:29,Twokinds,I like the idea of an island.
25-02-2018T00:33:38,Twokinds,Can't be all ship corridors again.
25-02-2018T00:33:55,Twokinds,As much as that makes it easy to draw...
25-02-2018T00:34:06,TheBeckoner,quiet quiet happy happy aqua-human things? hmm
25-02-2018T00:34:31,unsteddyphoenix,Lol I was gonna say
25-02-2018T00:34:39,unsteddyphoenix,But you have all those stock backgrounds~
25-02-2018T00:34:47,SpazztasticKiwi,So...humanoid guppies?
25-02-2018T00:35:09,Twokinds,Ever play dragon age?
25-02-2018T00:35:27,unsteddyphoenix,I love Dragon Age!
25-02-2018T00:35:35,unsteddyphoenix,One of my favourite games ever
25-02-2018T00:35:49,TheBeckoner,I have not.
25-02-2018T00:36:01,Twokinds,There's a sequence when all the characters are trapped in the fade and they're all experiencing a dream or nightmare constructed for me.
25-02-2018T00:36:15,unsteddyphoenix,Right I remember that
25-02-2018T00:36:36,Twokinds,That's a concept I've been toying with to delve further into the characters.
25-02-2018T00:37:19,Twokinds,And have the group going into each fantasy relm to retrieve a trapped character could lead to some fun situations.
25-02-2018T00:37:55,unsteddyphoenix,"""Face their inner demons"", as it were."
25-02-2018T00:38:05,unsteddyphoenix,"In dragon age there was literal demons, but..."
25-02-2018T00:38:14,TheBeckoner,"Aside from the comic, I'm starting to realize that I don't have much in common with any of y'all.."
25-02-2018T00:38:22,unsteddyphoenix,That type of story is much more my speed lol
25-02-2018T00:38:24,Twokinds,Yeah. Or it could be their ideal world that turns into a nightmare.
25-02-2018T00:38:28,TheBeckoner,guess I'll have to start looking into all the stuff y'all mention.
25-02-2018T00:39:25,Twokinds,"I'm picturing Eric surrounded by busy keidran, and the cast that enters his dream turn into busty women as well."
25-02-2018T00:40:16,Twokinds,"And then it turns into a nightmare when all the keidran turn into kat and Eric has to reject them all, and the real kat is insulted XD"
25-02-2018T00:40:33,unsteddyphoenix,...the darkest timeline...
25-02-2018T00:40:34,unsteddyphoenix,lmao
25-02-2018T00:41:05,unsteddyphoenix,two-for-one nightmare special
25-02-2018T00:41:11,Twokinds,lol
25-02-2018T00:41:16,Twokinds,"Yeah. You know, something like that."
25-02-2018T00:41:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I think she‚Äôs pretty throughly insulted by being sister-zoned
25-02-2018T00:42:23,TheBeckoner,what an unfortunate zone.
25-02-2018T00:43:17,unsteddyphoenix,Guess that could occur through like...some thing in Traces mansion...or the riftwall mirror maybe?
25-02-2018T00:43:47,Twokinds,"I dunno. Like I said, still toying with that concept."
25-02-2018T00:43:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch that - it‚Äôs dangerous‚Äù and of course, everyone touches it"
25-02-2018T00:43:55,Twokinds,I'm not sure if anything will come of it.
25-02-2018T00:44:50,Dadrobit,The Templar Mage is still unintroduced. Could be his gimmick? Seems like something an evil master mage would do to stop a hero's progression.
25-02-2018T00:45:13,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah...I guess it wouldnt be as serious as the fade sequence from dragon age
25-02-2018T00:45:38,unsteddyphoenix,I assume the Mage will be relevant later on though.
25-02-2018T00:51:37,unsteddyphoenix,"In any case, thanks for getting back to me on it at least."
25-02-2018T00:52:07,TheBeckoner,"Just make everyone gay and swap the gender. boom, done."
25-02-2018T00:52:16,TheBeckoner,hella plot
25-02-2018T00:52:31,unsteddyphoenix,Unsure about that one
25-02-2018T00:52:40,unsteddyphoenix,I'll put it in the maybe pile
25-02-2018T00:52:42,Dadrobit,Straight Alaric tho
25-02-2018T00:52:54,Dadrobit,Or... Is he still gay?
25-02-2018T00:53:01,TheBeckoner,Gotta be gay.
25-02-2018T00:53:02,Dadrobit,And everyone is just in his harem?
25-02-2018T00:53:06,unsteddyphoenix,Double gay
25-02-2018T00:53:31,unsteddyphoenix,"Alarics nightmare, Keith becomes gay he becomes straight"
25-02-2018T00:53:50,TheBeckoner,notpossible
25-02-2018T00:54:34,Dadrobit,"Speaking of nightmare, I need to do laundry before I show up to class tomorrow in swim trunks and a sweater..."
25-02-2018T00:55:13,SpazztasticKiwi,At least it‚Äôs not nude
25-02-2018T00:55:34,unsteddyphoenix,"If a flood happens, youll be ready"
25-02-2018T00:55:47,Dadrobit,Floods are the worst out here.
25-02-2018T00:55:56,Dadrobit,We are not built for rain
25-02-2018T00:56:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"And if it‚Äôs college, they‚Äôll likely just wonder what kind o g‚Äônight you had"
25-02-2018T00:56:07,Dadrobit,So floods just happen for any amount of rain
25-02-2018T00:56:56,Dadrobit,I don't think my classmates have ever seen my legs outside of my slacks
25-02-2018T00:57:26,unsteddyphoenix,Nows their chance!
25-02-2018T00:57:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"Unless they have X-ray vision, they haven‚Äôt seen them in slacks either"
25-02-2018T01:00:02,unsteddyphoenix,I feel. I never wear shorts unless I HAVE to.
25-02-2018T01:00:05,unsteddyphoenix,strong dislike
25-02-2018T01:00:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt wear pants if I don‚Äôt have to
25-02-2018T01:01:23,TheBeckoner,^
25-02-2018T01:01:24,Dadrobit,Shorts are really nice out here.
25-02-2018T01:01:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Night shorts and a big shirt
25-02-2018T01:01:38,Dadrobit,But I still don't wear them outside of tubing at the river
25-02-2018T01:01:46,TheBeckoner,I avoid pants like I avoid drool.
25-02-2018T01:01:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Best outfit
25-02-2018T01:02:12,TheBeckoner,Dang Im super light headed and floaty...
25-02-2018T01:02:22,TheBeckoner,&gt;possibly dying?
25-02-2018T01:02:25,TheBeckoner,possibly.
25-02-2018T01:02:31,unsteddyphoenix,"The ""morning after"" outfit"
25-02-2018T01:02:40,unsteddyphoenix,Try to not be doing that
25-02-2018T01:03:18,SpazztasticKiwi,People can think of me what they want. They will anyway
25-02-2018T01:03:21,Dadrobit,Probably not in your best interest
25-02-2018T01:03:30,TheBeckoner,Dying?
25-02-2018T01:03:33,unsteddyphoenix,That...is true yeah.
25-02-2018T01:04:00,Dadrobit,yes
25-02-2018T01:04:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"If I listened to rumors, I would‚Äôve been pregnant twice in high school"
25-02-2018T01:04:21,unsteddyphoenix,How many times were you actually pregnant?
25-02-2018T01:04:27,Dadrobit,4
25-02-2018T01:04:27,TheBeckoner,I'll die if I wanna thankyouverymuch
25-02-2018T01:04:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"None, obviously - I don‚Äôt have any kids"
25-02-2018T01:04:59,SpazztasticKiwi,And I‚Äôm not in a hurry to have any
25-02-2018T01:05:08,unsteddyphoenix,"Hey nice, thats the same as me"
25-02-2018T01:05:10,unsteddyphoenix,in highschool
25-02-2018T01:05:12,Dadrobit,Sooooo many pregnant girls in schools tho. Ludicrous
25-02-2018T01:05:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"I knew a few, yeah"
25-02-2018T01:05:36,TheBeckoner,Hmm I dont see too many pregos at school
25-02-2018T01:05:49,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah didnt happen in my strict-ass school.
25-02-2018T01:05:54,TheBeckoner,maybe 1?
25-02-2018T01:05:56,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, not that I noticed, anyway"
25-02-2018T01:05:58,SpazztasticKiwi,The condom broke on the two I knew of
25-02-2018T01:06:00,Dadrobit,"Parents are teachers, so I hear about it all."
25-02-2018T01:06:14,unsteddyphoenix,"Aha, insider knowledge"
25-02-2018T01:06:29,Dadrobit,"Mom taught at a junior high years ago in a really bad area, 2-3 every semester."
25-02-2018T01:06:49,Dadrobit,Far less once she came to high school in a better area
25-02-2018T01:07:36,unsteddyphoenix,LESS when she moved to highschool
25-02-2018T01:07:39,unsteddyphoenix,oof
25-02-2018T01:08:15,Dadrobit,"yup, it was a nasty area. Lots of gang activity and shit. Got worse when they shut down another school nearby and they had to combine"
25-02-2018T01:08:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Sounds fun
25-02-2018T01:08:41,Dadrobit,lots of conflicting gang kids suddenly sitting next to each other.
25-02-2018T01:08:53,Dadrobit,She got out fairly immediately after that
25-02-2018T01:09:08,TheBeckoner,I would hope so
25-02-2018T01:09:17,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúCan I be excused for the rest of my life?‚Äù
25-02-2018T01:09:22,unsteddyphoenix,I feel like ive seen that anime
25-02-2018T01:09:57,Dadrobit,:/ It's shitty when it's real.

25-02-2018T01:37:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah you see I was gonna make a screw the police joke until I realized how bad an idea I was
25-02-2018T01:37:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"But you did a joke for us, so...good job taking one for the tame"

25-02-2018T01:50:10,Twokinds,I'm not sure.
25-02-2018T01:50:24,Twokinds,My life would be so different it's impossible to really say.
25-02-2018T01:50:53,Twokinds,Maybe I'd be a Radiation Tech in a hospital somewhere?
25-02-2018T01:51:39,Twokinds,Who knows.
25-02-2018T01:52:08,unsteddyphoenix,good thing such a spooky timeline doesnt exist...
25-02-2018T01:52:51,Twokinds,I started Twokinds so young that I didn't have any other plans for my future.
25-02-2018T01:53:09,Twokinds,Crazy to think about.
25-02-2018T01:53:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Artist and radiation tech. That‚Äôs an occupation jump
25-02-2018T01:53:37,unsteddyphoenix,"Pretty unique situation, career starting at 13..."
25-02-2018T01:53:42,Twokinds,"That was my major in college, before I gave up on med school."
25-02-2018T01:53:54,Twokinds,I just always saw myself as an artist.
25-02-2018T01:54:12,unsteddyphoenix,"Do you think you wouldve kept doing it if it didnt blow up, or wouldve you tried another comic idea"
25-02-2018T01:54:33,Twokinds,I don't know what I would have done if Twokinds hadn't been successful.
25-02-2018T01:54:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Cool. I‚Äôve been kind of encouraged to go into medical school but I don‚Äôt feel terribly interested in it
25-02-2018T01:54:42,Twokinds,Probably tried other comic ideas sooner.
25-02-2018T01:54:46,iliar,"Or maybe draw some other comic. Not TK, but is popular too."
25-02-2018T01:54:59,Twokinds,Most likely. that's the real answer.
25-02-2018T01:55:04,Twokinds,"If it wasn't Twokinds, it would have been something else."
25-02-2018T01:55:14,Twokinds,Comics were almost inevitable.
25-02-2018T01:55:33,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI like this. Imma stick to it‚Äù
25-02-2018T01:55:40,unsteddyphoenix,Inevitable successful
25-02-2018T01:56:44,SpazztasticKiwi,And another question- I want to know so so that I know when to shut my mouth
25-02-2018T01:57:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Does mentioning Mark bother you?
25-02-2018T01:57:19,Twokinds,No
25-02-2018T01:59:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve just seen mentions that he‚Äôs seen people bother those who know him because of the connection
25-02-2018T02:01:57,SpazztasticKiwi,So I‚Äôve tried making an effort towards keeping you separate. Especially since I rarely see people use your actual name
25-02-2018T02:03:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Call me weird but I like to use names if I know them
25-02-2018T02:03:50,unsteddyphoenix,Using names? Weird
25-02-2018T02:06:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I finished cleaning my phone
25-02-2018T02:06:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I need a new screen protector
25-02-2018T02:50:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Well I think I‚Äôm gone for the night
25-02-2018T02:50:47,unsteddyphoenix,Goodnight~
25-02-2018T09:35:29,Gm35,I've never caught one of these streams
25-02-2018T09:35:48,Gm35,It's an epic rave I'm sure
25-02-2018T11:44:13,MidnightBlue78,"yeah, epic"
25-02-2018T11:44:59,MidnightBlue78,that's pretty much the only way to describe it
