27-03-2018T00:00:04,SpazztasticKiwi,We know he was born between the summer months and that’s it so I just chose a date
27-03-2018T00:01:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"But now the thing is, it’s now on someone else’s birthday"
27-03-2018T00:02:02,SpazztasticKiwi,But yeah Kiwi’s going to be seven this year and Bagheera’s gonna be two
27-03-2018T00:08:47,TheBeckoner,old and beb
27-03-2018T00:10:43,SpazztasticKiwi,seven is an old for a cat Holly’s nine
27-03-2018T00:10:56,SpazztasticKiwi,*isn’t old
27-03-2018T00:11:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"That reminds me it’s gonna be fun boarding your animals for your trip to Korea, Tom"
27-03-2018T00:11:53,unsteddyphoenix,I hope holly gets a birthday
27-03-2018T00:12:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Kiwi and Bagheera normally get some kind a treat like a canned food or something for their birthdays
27-03-2018T00:12:32,TheBeckoner,How do cats age compared to dogs?
27-03-2018T00:12:37,TheBeckoner,like bigger dogs
27-03-2018T00:12:44,unsteddyphoenix,"they live a bit longer on average, I think"
27-03-2018T00:12:53,Dadrobit,"The bigger the dog, the shorter the life"
27-03-2018T00:12:53,unsteddyphoenix,few years
27-03-2018T00:13:27,TheBeckoner,yeah
27-03-2018T00:13:28,unsteddyphoenix,Do cat keidran live longer than dog keidran? :thinking:
27-03-2018T00:13:38,TheBeckoner,our bigger dogs usually made 7 or 8
27-03-2018T00:13:48,Dadrobit,Cats can live up in and around 20 years if they're pampered indoors cats.
27-03-2018T00:13:52,unsteddyphoenix,oh god thats so short
27-03-2018T00:13:57,unsteddyphoenix,8 years...
27-03-2018T00:13:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"Indoor cats live about 20 years max, indoor/outdoor and full time outdoor cats about 15"
27-03-2018T00:14:21,Dadrobit,"Yeah, that's the worst thing about big dogs..."
27-03-2018T00:15:01,Dadrobit,Labs live around a dozen or so years.
27-03-2018T00:15:12,SpazztasticKiwi,My grandma’s big dog is pretty old - about 6 or 7 and still going
27-03-2018T00:15:19,Dadrobit,But real big dogs are lucky to see 10.
27-03-2018T00:15:31,unsteddyphoenix,But big dogs are the best thing about dogs :/
27-03-2018T00:15:38,Dadrobit,Yeah...
27-03-2018T00:16:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Y’all turn this into a birthday discussion to depression central
27-03-2018T00:16:31,TheBeckoner,Yeah. We had a mastiff that made 7 I think.
27-03-2018T00:16:51,TheBeckoner,Our other mediumish dog is around 7 now but in much better shape
27-03-2018T00:17:15,TheBeckoner,We also have some pigs we expect to get to 20 or so
27-03-2018T00:17:19,TheBeckoner,that'll be cool
27-03-2018T00:18:02,SpazztasticKiwi,If Bagheera lives his full life I’ll have him till him about 40
27-03-2018T00:18:16,TheBeckoner,nice
27-03-2018T00:18:43,TheBeckoner,neat to age alongside stuff
27-03-2018T00:18:49,TheBeckoner,if that makes sense
27-03-2018T00:19:04,TheBeckoner,sorta like a real apparent passing of time
27-03-2018T00:19:07,TheBeckoner,idk
27-03-2018T00:21:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Does Holly have a set birthday
27-03-2018T00:22:14,unsteddyphoenix,"Sure, but dont get a pet at the same time you have a baby"
27-03-2018T00:22:43,unsteddyphoenix,"""growing up together"" isnt worth it then"
27-03-2018T00:23:04,Dadrobit,Debatable.
27-03-2018T00:23:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t plan on having a baby so no problem there
27-03-2018T00:24:09,Twokinds,I don't know Holly's birthday.
27-03-2018T00:24:20,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:
27-03-2018T00:24:29,Twokinds,I don't even remember exactly when I got her.
27-03-2018T00:24:34,Twokinds,I kinda assume she's about 9.
27-03-2018T00:24:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Pick a date. It’s what I did for Bagheera
27-03-2018T00:24:58,unsteddyphoenix,If you dont know her birthday maybe she'll never age :thinking:
27-03-2018T00:25:12,unsteddyphoenix,be 9 forever
27-03-2018T00:27:13,SpazztasticKiwi,The secret to eternal youth: don’t acknowledge your birthday
27-03-2018T00:27:31,TheBeckoner,&gt;Never have birthday = never die
27-03-2018T00:29:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Hear that Tom? You don’t have to turn 31
27-03-2018T00:29:24,unsteddyphoenix,"I mean he's gonna live forever, so he's sorted on that front."
27-03-2018T00:29:47,SpazztasticKiwi,By the power procrastination I am immortal
27-03-2018T00:30:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"“Happy birth-” “La la la, can’t hear you”"
27-03-2018T00:32:32,SpazztasticKiwi,An immortal being has the ability to share their immortality with one other soul should they choose...
27-03-2018T00:32:57,SpazztasticKiwi,They begin dating another person and after a few years they reveal this ability...
27-03-2018T00:33:16,Dadrobit,Joan Jett
27-03-2018T00:33:21,SpazztasticKiwi,This partner finds it wonderful that they have such an ability and ask why they haven’t given it to them yet
27-03-2018T00:33:42,SpazztasticKiwi,The immortal size and says “I can’t I’m already sharing it with my cat”
27-03-2018T00:33:48,SpazztasticKiwi,*sighs
27-03-2018T00:34:02,unsteddyphoenix,:thumbsup:
27-03-2018T00:34:22,unsteddyphoenix,S'a good choice really.
27-03-2018T00:34:32,unsteddyphoenix,Comfort floof to weather eternity with.
27-03-2018T00:34:48,unsteddyphoenix,You'd probably get sick of any human given infinite time
27-03-2018T00:35:34,Twokinds,An eternity with a cat
27-03-2018T00:35:36,Twokinds,What a nightmare
27-03-2018T00:35:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh yeah it’s kind of a deadly thing for you isn’t it
27-03-2018T00:35:58,unsteddyphoenix,"You know, they'll probably cure allergies EVENTUALLY"
27-03-2018T00:36:09,unsteddyphoenix,Only gotta suffer for a few hundred years
27-03-2018T00:36:13,unsteddyphoenix,MAX
27-03-2018T00:36:14,SpazztasticKiwi,So you choose to use the ability on a partner huh
27-03-2018T00:36:30,Twokinds,I choose me
27-03-2018T00:36:57,unsteddyphoenix,Double immortality.
27-03-2018T00:36:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Antisocial much
27-03-2018T00:37:02,Twokinds,"Twice the me, twice the work done."
27-03-2018T00:37:26,SpazztasticKiwi,So you’re going to try and tell me if you left her 1000 years you would do the comic for 1000 years
27-03-2018T00:37:39,SpazztasticKiwi,*if you lived for
27-03-2018T00:38:01,unsteddyphoenix,Of course! The baby might be nearly born by then!
27-03-2018T00:38:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Jesus
27-03-2018T00:38:40,unsteddyphoenix,(Im sorry I think the comic is going at a reasonable pace the setup was just there)
27-03-2018T00:39:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m trying to eat here - you almost made me inhale apple
27-03-2018T00:39:25,Dadrobit,An apple a day~
27-03-2018T00:40:21,SpazztasticKiwi,An apple a day keeps the doctor away? Any fruit will keep anybody away if you throw it hard enough
27-03-2018T00:41:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though in mortality would get quite boring after a while, if not lonely"
27-03-2018T00:41:35,SpazztasticKiwi,*immortality
27-03-2018T00:42:05,unsteddyphoenix,As long as humanity keeps existing there'll prolly always be new stuff
27-03-2018T00:42:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"What if it was like we weren’t immortal, but is soon as somebody fell in love with us we stopped aging"
27-03-2018T00:43:17,TheBeckoner,What if we dont know they fall in love with us?
27-03-2018T00:43:31,TheBeckoner,So many youtubers are immortal then...
27-03-2018T00:43:37,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
27-03-2018T00:43:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m pretty sure after a while you’d notice you’re not aging
27-03-2018T00:43:47,unsteddyphoenix,What if theyre asian?
27-03-2018T00:43:52,TheBeckoner,lolwut
27-03-2018T00:44:00,SpazztasticKiwi,What does that have to do with the price of tea in China
27-03-2018T00:44:04,unsteddyphoenix,Well they dont age so.
27-03-2018T00:44:06,unsteddyphoenix,Thats just science
27-03-2018T00:44:10,unsteddyphoenix,Or Keanu Reeves
27-03-2018T00:44:17,TheBeckoner,Both?
27-03-2018T00:45:18,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s a difference between a crush and love
27-03-2018T00:45:20,Dadrobit,What if you fall in love with them and they don't reciprocate?
27-03-2018T00:46:21,unsteddyphoenix,What if they love the IDEA of you
27-03-2018T00:46:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Loving the person and the idea of the person is very different
27-03-2018T00:46:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Loving the person is what would make them stop aging
27-03-2018T00:47:11,unsteddyphoenix,HONEY I JUST AGED WE NEED TO TALK.
27-03-2018T00:47:14,Dadrobit,They would live forever with someone they don't want to be with.
27-03-2018T00:47:44,SpazztasticKiwi,They just stop aging you don’t have to be with them. Especially since you can fall in and out of love and love multiple people at same time
27-03-2018T00:49:29,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s just more of a writing prompt than anything else. Something like that would be impossible to reason in the real world or understand completely
27-03-2018T00:49:55,unsteddyphoenix,you notice your hair has started greying. You immediately file for divorce.
27-03-2018T00:50:08,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I know what you're talking about, saw it years ago back when I thought I was gonna be an author."
27-03-2018T00:50:55,SpazztasticKiwi,You could just imagine though: you’re working on a project and you notice you haven’t seen a gray hair in a while
27-03-2018T00:51:26,SpazztasticKiwi,And you have to wonder/figure out who it is
27-03-2018T00:53:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"And even better if two people fall in love with each other and, of course their aging stops, they’re effectively immortal"
27-03-2018T00:54:29,unsteddyphoenix,I do enjoy that writingprompts subreddit
27-03-2018T00:54:44,unsteddyphoenix,But by the time I get around to doing one the threads already dead~
27-03-2018T00:55:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Though it would be a little sketchy for those who show no interest in dating
27-03-2018T00:55:52,TheBeckoner,GuessI'lldiethen
27-03-2018T00:56:16,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah nothing would change for me either way :upside_down:
27-03-2018T00:56:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I guess that would be where the fall in love with your self concept comes in. But then you have the problem of some people not being able to love themselves
27-03-2018T00:56:28,Dadrobit,"*professes love to the immortal woman* ""Sorry, I'm gay."""
27-03-2018T00:56:49,SpazztasticKiwi,This prompt is just depressing
27-03-2018T00:57:06,unsteddyphoenix,lol
27-03-2018T00:57:39,TheBeckoner,Hmm just figured out my mediumish dog is nearly 10
27-03-2018T00:58:15,TheBeckoner,Kinda sad since she is the only one left from the other house we lived at...
27-03-2018T00:58:28,SpazztasticKiwi,*professes love to person* “Sorry. I’m not interested in dating.”
27-03-2018T00:58:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Which is worse?
27-03-2018T00:59:34,TheBeckoner,well idk. Find someone or get comfortable with dying alone while your peers live potentially forever.
27-03-2018T01:00:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Hey Tom if you could swap that immortality thing with a different animal instead of a cat would you
27-03-2018T01:01:29,TheBeckoner,"Swap it with an elephant and have a battle beast, forever."
27-03-2018T01:01:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Or are you allergic to all things fluffy
27-03-2018T01:01:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Not just cats and dogs
27-03-2018T01:02:36,unsteddyphoenix,Do a horse and become like an urban legend

27-03-2018T01:03:59,TheBeckoner,like
27-03-2018T01:04:03,TheBeckoner,a junebug
27-03-2018T01:04:19,Dadrobit,immortal doesn't always mean invulnerable.
27-03-2018T01:04:19,TheBeckoner,Little immortal bug friend
27-03-2018T01:04:25,TheBeckoner,well
27-03-2018T01:04:26,TheBeckoner,yeah

27-03-2018T01:04:56,TheBeckoner,hmmm
27-03-2018T01:05:10,TheBeckoner,You are immune to it if you choose it I guess?
27-03-2018T01:05:30,unsteddyphoenix,How is your comic so cute.
27-03-2018T01:05:35,Twokinds,XD
27-03-2018T01:06:00,unsteddyphoenix,Lowkey waiting for the other ball to drop and a dystopia to start in twokinds.
27-03-2018T01:06:22,unsteddyphoenix,If you do it i'll be ready.

27-03-2018T01:08:04,TheBeckoner,Well he isnt doing it
27-03-2018T01:08:08,TheBeckoner,directly
27-03-2018T01:08:11,unsteddyphoenix,Would probably make a decent prompt story
27-03-2018T01:09:10,SpazztasticKiwi,But then there’s nobody allowed to deliver your pizza
27-03-2018T01:09:18,Dadrobit,Read a similar science fiction short a while back that was kind of similar.

27-03-2018T01:10:00,Dadrobit,And the remaining uninfected survivors hid away in bunkers.
27-03-2018T01:10:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Well none of us ever seem to leave home so we’re good
27-03-2018T01:10:14,unsteddyphoenix,I think ive heard of that. Dunno if I read it.
27-03-2018T01:10:46,Dadrobit,It was told from the perspective of an uninfected teen born into the world post catastrophe.
27-03-2018T01:10:55,TheBeckoner,Sounds pretty good
27-03-2018T01:11:13,Dadrobit,"But one time he went out hunting, and his suit was punctured."
27-03-2018T01:11:18,unsteddyphoenix,If I wasnt 5000% burnt out on super powers i'd be interested.

27-03-2018T01:13:02,TheBeckoner,Cool way to go as well
27-03-2018T01:13:07,Dadrobit,As the teen was not allowed back into the bunker by his parents and otherwise would have died alone.
27-03-2018T01:13:21,TheBeckoner,double sad
27-03-2018T01:13:44,Dadrobit,"No, he was found by a child born into the infection and survived, hence his ability to create a world for the mind of the dying teen."
27-03-2018T01:13:55,TheBeckoner,Right

27-03-2018T01:30:03,unsteddyphoenix,"How's it not furry. Was it like, just anime ears and tail?"
27-03-2018T01:30:40,Dadrobit,IIRC she transformed between full human and full fox.

27-03-2018T01:45:18,Dadrobit,Crisis averted
27-03-2018T01:45:38,unsteddyphoenix,cats status?
27-03-2018T01:46:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera got sick again
27-03-2018T01:46:14,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-floAAA:
27-03-2018T01:46:22,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s currently trying to find the other cat behind my mirror
27-03-2018T01:47:09,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-daydreamingkat: He'll gettem~
27-03-2018T01:47:39,SpazztasticKiwi,It shouldn’t be as funny as it is
27-03-2018T01:49:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Now he’s trying to play with the other cat
27-03-2018T01:50:20,unsteddyphoenix,"It's good to have friends, even if your friend is you."
27-03-2018T01:50:40,Dadrobit,That's what Tom was trying to do earlier
27-03-2018T01:51:31,SpazztasticKiwi,For a second I thought you meant something like Tom was trying to find the other Tom behind the mirror or something
27-03-2018T01:51:38,SpazztasticKiwi,So confused
27-03-2018T01:51:45,unsteddyphoenix,Yo true.
27-03-2018T01:52:12,Twokinds,I'll catch him one day. I mean me.
27-03-2018T01:52:34,SpazztasticKiwi,What if your reflection is an alternate universe you
27-03-2018T01:52:34,Twokinds,goes to find himself
27-03-2018T01:52:45,unsteddyphoenix,Deep...
27-03-2018T01:52:46,Dadrobit,There's a writing prompt: The person in the mirror is actualy someone else.
27-03-2018T01:53:11,unsteddyphoenix,"The only scary ""Goosebumps"" story I ever read had that concept."
27-03-2018T01:53:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Well his name is “Two”kinds
27-03-2018T01:53:51,unsteddyphoenix,Kid figured out that his reflection was a real person just imitating him. After he found out his reflection convinces him to switch places with him.
27-03-2018T01:54:10,Dadrobit,I feel like I read that maybe?
27-03-2018T01:54:24,SpazztasticKiwi,What if one day you were looking in the mirror and you saw your reflection blink
27-03-2018T01:54:26,unsteddyphoenix,"But then the mirror world only exists to what the mirror can see, and the reflection just lives his life while he was trapped there forever"
27-03-2018T01:54:27,Twokinds,I had a horror story that had that sort of premise in it
27-03-2018T01:55:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Wasn’t that a part of a Danny Phantom episode
27-03-2018T01:55:15,unsteddyphoenix,"Dunno if Goosebumps book are really horror, but it was the only one that scared me"
27-03-2018T01:55:53,unsteddyphoenix,Never trusted mirrors after that...
27-03-2018T01:55:57,unsteddyphoenix,What are they up to...
27-03-2018T01:56:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Reflecting on life
27-03-2018T01:56:26,unsteddyphoenix,lol
27-03-2018T01:56:33,unsteddyphoenix,booo~
27-03-2018T01:57:33,SpazztasticKiwi,*evil laughter*
27-03-2018T01:59:32,Twokinds,Man stocks need to calm down
27-03-2018T02:00:32,iliar,"At first I think ""If Tom catch another Tom behind the mirror, it's means we have x2 arts and sketches. Yay!""."
27-03-2018T02:00:36,iliar,"But then I thought ""Tom behind the mirror always does the same thing as the real Tom"" so yes, technically we have x2 arts and sketches. But they will be the same."
27-03-2018T02:00:54,SpazztasticKiwi,turn in conversation
27-03-2018T02:00:55,unsteddyphoenix,How's your crypto?
27-03-2018T02:01:26,SpazztasticKiwi,That stocks talk out of here
27-03-2018T02:01:38,unsteddyphoenix,Invest in gold
27-03-2018T02:02:08,unsteddyphoenix,I heard once that stocks can me more reliable than putting your  money in banks
27-03-2018T02:02:28,iliar,There remains only one possibility. Tom behind the mirror not always does the same thing as the real Tom. Maybe sometimes Tom behind the mirror doing some interesting things... When no one sees this.
27-03-2018T02:02:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Probably depends on the Stocks you invest in
27-03-2018T02:02:36,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh yeah, ofc"
27-03-2018T02:03:09,SpazztasticKiwi,So you’re talking about a twin of Tom who is like Tom but not
27-03-2018T02:04:10,unsteddyphoenix,"So, a twin."
27-03-2018T02:04:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Wait twin or clone
27-03-2018T02:05:19,iliar,No. I'm talking about Tom's reflection in the mirror. Have you ever thought what your reflection does when you are not near to a mirror?
27-03-2018T02:05:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Never had time to really reflect on it
27-03-2018T02:06:30,iliar,"For example, you leave the room. And your reflection in the mirror also leaves the room. But what does it do next?"
27-03-2018T02:06:43,unsteddyphoenix,Hard drugs probably.
27-03-2018T02:07:22,Twokinds,I though the mirror universe us were supposed to do the opposite of what we already do.
27-03-2018T02:08:50,iliar,Hmm ... I'm pretty sure that mirrors do not work that way.
27-03-2018T02:10:08,iliar,My reflection always copies my movements. I never saw that my reflection would be doing something else. And you?
27-03-2018T02:10:18,SpazztasticKiwi,That means there’s a hot and an ugly version of all of us out there
27-03-2018T02:10:55,Dadrobit,What if you're a solid 5?
27-03-2018T02:11:14,SpazztasticKiwi,You’d be dead humans are supposed to be 70% water
27-03-2018T02:11:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though if it’s a true opposite version, they’d be the opposite gender"
27-03-2018T02:12:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Wonder what I’d look like as a guy
27-03-2018T02:12:48,Dadrobit,Momrobit
27-03-2018T02:12:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Ma!
27-03-2018T02:14:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Why would you do if you passed by mirror one day and saw a female version of you
27-03-2018T02:14:52,iliar,ugly version... hmm... Perhaps this explains why behind the mirror always looks at me ugly guy.
27-03-2018T02:14:59,Dadrobit,Admire me probably.
27-03-2018T02:18:11,Bgrmystr2,xD I feel the same as dadro
27-03-2018T02:19:06,unsteddyphoenix,Same
27-03-2018T02:19:20,unsteddyphoenix,Try on cute outfits?
27-03-2018T02:19:41,Dadrobit,Probably shave the beard first.
27-03-2018T02:19:58,Bgrmystr2,would the female version in the mirror be wearing a female version of the outfit you're wearing? :thinking:
27-03-2018T02:20:07,Bgrmystr2,"also, why would a female version of you have a beard?"
27-03-2018T02:20:18,unsteddyphoenix,^
27-03-2018T02:20:40,Dadrobit,Because I currently have a beard?
27-03-2018T02:20:52,Dadrobit,"Although, I'm really not sure if I want to keep it."
27-03-2018T02:20:54,Bgrmystr2,You're male
27-03-2018T02:21:03,Bgrmystr2,a female you likely wouldn't have the beard.
27-03-2018T02:21:23,Bgrmystr2,I have a beard too. I have no reason to think a female version of me would also have a beard.
27-03-2018T02:21:26,Bgrmystr2,that seems silly
27-03-2018T02:21:32,Dadrobit,Beard's got a lot more upkeep to it than my regular goatee
27-03-2018T02:21:54,Dadrobit,Not sure if I want this kind of commitment right now.
27-03-2018T02:21:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Is facial hair not itchy
27-03-2018T02:22:00,unsteddyphoenix,"What would make more sense is shaving your legs, girls have leghair too"
27-03-2018T02:22:30,Dadrobit,"Also, my Flynn Ryder cosplay is shot to hell while I've got the full face."
27-03-2018T02:22:38,unsteddyphoenix,Nah not itchy
27-03-2018T02:23:15,unsteddyphoenix,"Thats true, you need to prep now"
27-03-2018T02:23:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Where are you going to cosplay as Flynn Rider
27-03-2018T02:23:58,Dadrobit,Everywhere
27-03-2018T02:25:00,unsteddyphoenix,and always
27-03-2018T02:43:08,SpazztasticKiwi,When’s momocon this year

27-03-2018T02:46:44,Dadrobit,With or without the Grumps?
27-03-2018T02:47:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t see them listed
27-03-2018T02:48:03,SpazztasticKiwi,It reminds me of how popular the athletic guy was
27-03-2018T02:48:57,Dadrobit,Never got around to playing that
27-03-2018T02:53:48,unsteddyphoenix,Seems like youre oblige4d to play it
27-03-2018T02:55:04,SpazztasticKiwi,They’re all basically stereotypes it seems
27-03-2018T02:55:44,Dadrobit,It would definitely make a certain kind of sense that I would be obligated to play it.
27-03-2018T02:59:15,unsteddyphoenix,I would agree
27-03-2018T03:09:28,Dadrobit,First I need to make a post or three on the forums. Peeps be getting angst-y with me.
27-03-2018T03:14:06,unsteddyphoenix,:O

27-03-2018T03:21:21,Dadrobit,The battery is in the deepest section of the phone
27-03-2018T03:21:30,Twokinds,Ah
27-03-2018T03:21:34,Dadrobit,Gotta take out allllll of the internal components to get to it
27-03-2018T03:21:40,Twokinds,That's unfortunate
27-03-2018T03:21:46,Twokinds,I wouldn't trust myself to try something like that
27-03-2018T03:23:00,Dadrobit,"Yeah, watching a repair video and half of the comments are horror stories of people stripping out one of the screws or destroying something like the earpiece."
27-03-2018T03:23:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Would a store do that without costing an arm and a leg
27-03-2018T03:25:07,SpazztasticKiwi,My battery doesn’t pop out. It’s kinda set in there
27-03-2018T03:25:19,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I could probably just bring it into a local shop and give em $50 or so."
27-03-2018T03:25:43,SpazztasticKiwi,#notworthit?
27-03-2018T03:25:59,Dadrobit,:( I really like this phone
27-03-2018T03:26:43,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s weird how attached you get
27-03-2018T03:27:23,Dadrobit,Me in particular? Or people in general?
27-03-2018T03:27:41,SpazztasticKiwi,People in general to their phones and such
27-03-2018T03:28:07,unsteddyphoenix,Resist change
27-03-2018T03:28:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m so protective of my phone only two other people are allowed to use it not counting tech people
27-03-2018T03:29:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"Bagheera touches it too, but that doesn’t really count"
27-03-2018T03:33:45,unsteddyphoenix,your cat has all your personal info
27-03-2018T03:34:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Pretty sure I can live with that
27-03-2018T03:34:37,SpazztasticKiwi,But I guess would be in trouble for cats could talk
27-03-2018T03:35:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"Just think. All of what they’ve seen, and they can suddenly speak"
27-03-2018T03:35:24,unsteddyphoenix,Just because they choose not to speak doesnt mean they cant
27-03-2018T03:36:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I asked Bagheera if he could talk
27-03-2018T03:36:10,SpazztasticKiwi,He meowed
27-03-2018T03:36:45,unsteddyphoenix,Thats exactly what i'd expect him to say...
27-03-2018T03:38:04,Bgrmystr2,that's cuz that's how cats speak to humans :P
27-03-2018T03:38:13,Bgrmystr2,they don't do that w/ other cats

27-03-2018T03:42:57,unsteddyphoenix,A liar
27-03-2018T03:43:24,SpazztasticKiwi,To be fair he has stated he’s not interested in a companion so it could be true
27-03-2018T03:43:38,Bgrmystr2,"Kiwi, Have you read his comic?"
27-03-2018T03:43:41,Bgrmystr2,or seen his art?
27-03-2018T03:43:45,Bgrmystr2,any of it?
27-03-2018T03:43:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe
27-03-2018T03:43:50,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
27-03-2018T03:43:53,unsteddyphoenix,Also maybe

27-03-2018T03:46:03,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah I dont really have a strong preference, I think"
27-03-2018T03:46:21,unsteddyphoenix,"Maybe slightly more butts, I guess."

27-03-2018T03:47:27,Bgrmystr2,can appreciate both

27-03-2018T03:47:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m pretty equal on both. Though with me liking guys I don’t know if that counts on the boob front
27-03-2018T03:47:41,Bgrmystr2,xD ^
27-03-2018T03:47:44,Bgrmystr2,you can be a girl and like boobs

27-03-2018T03:48:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah boobs are great. I’m just saying from an attraction standpoint
27-03-2018T03:49:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Not sure about a guy with a cup size bigger than me
27-03-2018T03:49:24,unsteddyphoenix,Tsk tsk~
27-03-2018T03:49:27,Bgrmystr2,xD
27-03-2018T03:49:31,unsteddyphoenix,I guess girls need a different comparison
27-03-2018T03:49:37,unsteddyphoenix,Like...forearms?
27-03-2018T03:49:57,Dadrobit,Style

27-03-2018T03:50:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Personally. that’s not even a question
27-03-2018T03:50:38,Bgrmystr2,what if they have the personality of a butt? :c
27-03-2018T03:50:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Doesn’t matter how good you look if you have the personality of a wet paper bag
27-03-2018T03:51:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I like one ass on my guy OK
27-03-2018T03:51:47,unsteddyphoenix,Damnit. How am I gonna compensate for my personality now.

27-03-2018T03:52:55,Bgrmystr2,xD
27-03-2018T03:55:09,SpazztasticKiwi,This conversation just got kinda interesting
27-03-2018T03:55:56,unsteddyphoenix,brag about it dad
27-03-2018T03:56:10,Dadrobit,Just gotta work on your smoulder is al.
27-03-2018T03:56:13,Dadrobit,all*
27-03-2018T03:56:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Did you not watch the movie? you know how that turned out for Flynn Rider
27-03-2018T03:56:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Frying pan to the face
27-03-2018T03:56:58,Dadrobit,"Yeah, my sex life is a running joke, I get it."
27-03-2018T03:57:20,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s the problem I don’t think it’s ever ran
27-03-2018T03:57:34,Dadrobit,"I don't mind all that much, I get a bunch of funny stories out of it."
27-03-2018T03:57:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Hell I don’t think it’s gotten up
27-03-2018T03:58:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Everybody always talks about what their number is on a scale of 1 to 10. What about sex appeal because that’s different
27-03-2018T03:58:56,Dadrobit,I have it on good authority that I am a 7. Thanks Marv.
27-03-2018T04:00:53,SpazztasticKiwi,So your average between the two scales is six. you’re a six
27-03-2018T04:01:17,Dadrobit,Who called me a 5?
27-03-2018T04:01:22,SpazztasticKiwi,You
27-03-2018T04:01:25,Dadrobit,?????
27-03-2018T04:02:00,SpazztasticKiwi,You called yourself a “solid 5” earlier
27-03-2018T04:02:08,Bgrmystr2,yeah out of 5
27-03-2018T04:02:18,Bgrmystr2,it's the same as a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 xD
27-03-2018T04:02:38,Dadrobit,"That was a question for the reflections conversation, I was asking for the 5's out there, not me"
27-03-2018T04:02:44,Dadrobit,"And thanks, Bgr."
27-03-2018T04:02:45,Bgrmystr2,also equivilant on a scale of 1 to 7.
27-03-2018T04:02:59,Bgrmystr2,5/7 would be an equally perfect score.
27-03-2018T04:03:19,Dadrobit,#QualityScaling
27-03-2018T04:03:25,SpazztasticKiwi,We’re starting to think too far into this
27-03-2018T04:03:38,Bgrmystr2,"naw, we're exactly where we should be."
27-03-2018T04:04:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Then there’s also the personality scale of 1-10
27-03-2018T04:04:44,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah thisis making sense to me
27-03-2018T04:05:19,Dadrobit,Personality is way more subjective than appearance.
27-03-2018T04:05:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Both vary on the observer’s opinion too
27-03-2018T04:06:58,SpazztasticKiwi,For example somebody who prefers a sweet quiet personality might write you a 5 while someone who prefers an active person would rate you a 2
27-03-2018T04:07:07,Dadrobit,"On the one hand, my personality has gotten me a lot of good times, on the other, it has made a woman curse my unborn children to be retarded."
27-03-2018T04:07:27,unsteddyphoenix,loool
27-03-2018T04:07:34,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s her problem
27-03-2018T04:07:48,Dadrobit,It was certainly her opinion.
27-03-2018T04:09:39,SpazztasticKiwi,It was also somebody’s opinion that a blended guy wasn’t a fit for me
27-03-2018T04:09:57,SpazztasticKiwi,People love appearance more than anything else
27-03-2018T04:10:46,Dadrobit,More than anything else? Probably not. But I certainly take it into consideration.
27-03-2018T04:20:26,unsteddyphoenix,It's not irrelevant no
27-03-2018T04:21:42,unsteddyphoenix,There does have to be physical attraction or it doesnt work
27-03-2018T04:21:44,unsteddyphoenix,I GUESS.
27-03-2018T04:28:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"I won’t blindly follow a nice personality, no. Physical attraction is a factor, but it’s a relatively less prominent one"
27-03-2018T04:30:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"This guy was nice and attractive. Though he was a little older, people chose to focus on what he looked like"
27-03-2018T04:32:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"To be honest though, I’ve decided to try letting love find me this round"
27-03-2018T04:45:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I gotta go to bed - I’ll see you later
27-03-2018T04:49:54,Dadrobit,"Night, Spazz."

27-03-2018T05:21:07,Dadrobit,"Of course, but cat pics are only like a quarter of the total. Lots of hiking pictures, and a metric shit-ton of class notes."
27-03-2018T05:24:23,unsteddyphoenix,Does your lecturers not just put the notes online
27-03-2018T05:24:28,unsteddyphoenix,You gotta take pictures
27-03-2018T05:24:34,unsteddyphoenix,Thats so annoying

27-03-2018T05:26:57,Dadrobit,And stuff like board settings back when I was taking Studio Recording.
27-03-2018T05:28:15,unsteddyphoenix,Ahhh yeah. Those huge-ass boards
27-03-2018T05:28:21,unsteddyphoenix,Ive played with them once
27-03-2018T05:28:28,unsteddyphoenix,I basically had no idea what I was doing~
27-03-2018T05:28:34,unsteddyphoenix,Pictures wouldve been a good idea
27-03-2018T05:29:21,Dadrobit,One sec while I find something.
27-03-2018T05:32:56,Dadrobit,"https://i.imgur.com/yN7R0n3.jpg This SSL was the primary board for the Studio Recording classes, but we also have a smaller Tascam and an API for Sound Design and small band recording."
27-03-2018T05:33:15,Dadrobit,So I just have a ton of close ups of different settings for different inputs.
27-03-2018T05:33:56,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock:
27-03-2018T05:33:58,unsteddyphoenix,Couldnt tell you the one I worked with. Think it was a bit smaller than that.
27-03-2018T05:34:10,unsteddyphoenix,"Small band recording, cool~"
27-03-2018T05:34:16,Dadrobit,Then a bunch of others showing proper mic technique for micing up drums and stuff.
27-03-2018T05:34:33,Bgrmystr2,"I've never even seen one of those. I mean, pictures of them, but nothing that extensive"
27-03-2018T05:34:52,Bgrmystr2,that's crazy. what in the godly fuck do you need that many knobs for?
27-03-2018T05:35:12,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I know audio and sound design is complicated, but that's completely ridiculous"
27-03-2018T05:35:15,Dadrobit,"Yeah, the college used to run its own radio station, but after that went by the wayside, they transformed the space for several smaller recording spaces."
27-03-2018T05:35:35,Bgrmystr2,did they even use half of them? xD
27-03-2018T05:36:19,Dadrobit,It's not so bad when you realize that they all are just the same pots used for individual tracks multiplied across 20 or so channels.
27-03-2018T05:36:37,Dadrobit,The only variation is in the vertical
27-03-2018T05:36:43,Bgrmystr2,yeah but.. 20 channels for what
27-03-2018T05:36:51,Dadrobit,Microphones
27-03-2018T05:36:56,Dadrobit,and monitoring
27-03-2018T05:37:23,Bgrmystr2,so they have like 20 people collectively monitoring and/or chatting on a radio station?
27-03-2018T05:37:29,Dadrobit,"8+ microphones for a drumset, 2-3 for a guitar, they go fast."
27-03-2018T05:37:33,Bgrmystr2,I guess that makes sense :ptv-wondering:
27-03-2018T05:38:05,Bgrmystr2,"I was thinking of just radio, there's no god damn way you're gonna have the bands play live on every radio station lol"
27-03-2018T05:38:19,Bgrmystr2,so 20 inputs is just excessive
27-03-2018T05:38:30,Bgrmystr2,it'd be just for the radio hosts
27-03-2018T05:39:49,Dadrobit,"Ehhh, even for radio, you might want to have several different mixes. Talk-show mixes, commercial mixes, music mixes..."
27-03-2018T05:40:28,Dadrobit,That particular board came from a news station.
27-03-2018T05:41:02,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:

27-03-2018T06:30:30,Dadrobit,"Yup, Arizona really doesn't fuck around with that kinda stuff. Phoenix is unfortunately kind of notorious for human trafficking including children..."
27-03-2018T06:31:43,unsteddyphoenix,Really now
27-03-2018T06:31:59,Dadrobit,"People trying to get in from Mexico that get into bad positions from traffickers that get them in, then sell them off."
27-03-2018T06:32:00,unsteddyphoenix,I guess it's hard to keep ttrack of those things in huge countries like america
27-03-2018T06:33:23,unsteddyphoenix,At least it's becoming more and more known that this stuff happens
27-03-2018T06:33:38,unsteddyphoenix,Noone trusts hollywood anymore
27-03-2018T06:37:40,Dadrobit,"On a funnier note, Larry King called into The Morning Sickness Show this morning. Nothing better than hearing Larry King making antisemetic jokes."
27-03-2018T06:39:17,unsteddyphoenix,Never heard of that show
27-03-2018T06:39:23,unsteddyphoenix,"And yet, I resonate with it."
27-03-2018T06:42:17,Dadrobit,"And them making fun of his 7 marriages. ""So are they on a ten year contract?"""
27-03-2018T06:42:45,Bgrmystr2,gonna head to bed. Fighting youtube being the pos it is as usual and being up at 6:40am is not a good combo..

27-03-2018T06:43:35,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-sleepy:
27-03-2018T06:43:53,unsteddyphoenix,Good job not assuming my time of day
27-03-2018T06:44:00,unsteddyphoenix,Very progressive
27-03-2018T06:44:03,unsteddyphoenix,SEVEN marriages oof.
27-03-2018T10:08:55,TheGamePlayer,GOOD MORNING!!!!!!!!!!!
27-03-2018T10:09:04,TheGamePlayer,to loud oops
27-03-2018T14:27:57,TheBeckoner,Hm I think I caused permanent nerve damage to my finger just before my pinky finger.  I smashed it the other day and it's still numb...
27-03-2018T16:31:47,Vatruvius,Hello everyone! :ptv-greetings: Are we planning on a stream sometime today Tom...or are we settling for tomorrow or something?
27-03-2018T16:33:29,Bgrmystr2,"Vatru, the Wed streams are died."
27-03-2018T16:34:08,Bgrmystr2,The only scheduled days now are Fri and Sun. :u
27-03-2018T16:34:09,Vatruvius,I know that...we killed the schedule streams so that Tom is more free on when he would do a page stream right? I am just checking in to see what I can get done today.
27-03-2018T16:34:17,Bgrmystr2,"We didn't do anything, he did"
27-03-2018T16:34:27,Bgrmystr2,xD
27-03-2018T16:34:36,Vatruvius,So funny Bgr
27-03-2018T16:34:44,Bgrmystr2,you type funny. :V
27-03-2018T16:36:02,Vatruvius,I am just curious if Tom said anything about the next page stream.
27-03-2018T16:36:10,Bgrmystr2,nope
27-03-2018T16:36:39,Vatruvius,"To my knowledge, the Friday and Sunday streams are still the color and sketch streams accordingly...right?"
27-03-2018T16:36:47,Bgrmystr2,no and no :P
27-03-2018T16:36:59,Bgrmystr2,"Fri is just art, whatever happens to be on the docket"
27-03-2018T16:37:06,Bgrmystr2,and sunday is the sketch / color streams for patreon
27-03-2018T16:37:23,Vatruvius,I see...that clears some things up.
27-03-2018T16:37:57,Bgrmystr2,Tom's done lots of things on Fri before. It used to be his only scheduled stream day
27-03-2018T16:38:22,Bgrmystr2,"He'd do new pages, sketches, vote incentives, etc"
27-03-2018T16:38:29,Vatruvius,Well I got some stuff I got to do...I will check in later if I can.
27-03-2018T16:38:39,Bgrmystr2,"now that the patreon streams are sunday, he can do the nora cards on Fri too"
27-03-2018T16:38:51,Vatruvius,That must have been hard...or easy...I am not sure. I like a schedule so depends on the person.
27-03-2018T16:39:19,Bgrmystr2,yeh it seems kinda complicated for tom
27-03-2018T16:39:29,Vatruvius,Anyway...see you around Bgr!
27-03-2018T16:39:52,Bgrmystr2,mkay :ptv-greetings:
27-03-2018T16:55:07,Bigboi182,Afternoon!
27-03-2018T16:55:54,Bigboi182,Any idea what time the stream is (if it happens today)?
27-03-2018T16:56:08,BadFoMo,Nope. Sorry.
27-03-2018T16:56:17,Bigboi182,Mkay.
27-03-2018T17:08:12,Bigboi182,At least Tom's not lurking in the shadows anymore...
27-03-2018T17:12:32,TheBeckoner,Watched that Radio station close down Bgr. Sad stuff.
27-03-2018T17:24:25,Bgrmystr2,My fuckin childhood man :ptv-whiny:
27-03-2018T17:24:57,Vatruvius,Okay...what did I just walk into?
27-03-2018T17:26:58,TheBeckoner,Bgr is sad upon remembering the closing of his favorite radio station.
27-03-2018T17:27:05,TheBeckoner,Video was linked waaayyy up in chat
27-03-2018T17:27:19,TheBeckoner,My Favorite station is still goin thankfully
27-03-2018T17:27:42,TheBeckoner,"106.9 ""Houston's only classic rock sation"""
27-03-2018T17:30:39,Vatruvius,Huh...sorry to hear that Bgr.
27-03-2018T17:31:11,Bigboi182,What radio station was that?
27-03-2018T17:31:32,Bgrmystr2,well.. I JUST found out it was closed last night
27-03-2018T17:31:35,Bgrmystr2,I never knew
27-03-2018T17:31:38,Bigboi182,Oh.
27-03-2018T17:32:07,Bgrmystr2,I haven't listened to it since like 2002
27-03-2018T17:32:10,Bgrmystr2,:(
27-03-2018T17:32:11,Bigboi182,"Well, I'll always have Y 98.7"
27-03-2018T17:32:21,Bigboi182,Listened to it since birth.
27-03-2018T17:32:34,Bgrmystr2,hope it doesn't go away too
27-03-2018T17:32:44,Bigboi182,It's partially the reason why I'm the whitest black person alive...
27-03-2018T17:32:58,Bigboi182,It's just pure pop music.
27-03-2018T17:33:16,Bigboi182,We have a rap station too...
27-03-2018T17:33:16,TheBeckoner,I've used to listen to 100.3 up until I started driving. Listened to that one since I was born basically as well
27-03-2018T17:33:41,TheBeckoner,Still around too
27-03-2018T17:33:47,Bigboi182,It's also 100.3 coincidentally Beck...
27-03-2018T17:34:03,Bigboi182,Except it's nicknamed 100 Jamz.
27-03-2018T17:34:08,TheBeckoner,Ha what a coincidence
27-03-2018T17:34:15,Bigboi182,I think it's pretty retarded.
27-03-2018T17:34:26,Bigboi182,"The station, I mean..."
27-03-2018T17:34:34,TheBeckoner,The station near me is country-ish stuff
27-03-2018T17:34:43,TheBeckoner,Dont really listen to it anymore tho
27-03-2018T17:34:47,Bigboi182,Same.
27-03-2018T17:35:11,Bigboi182,I honestly thought we were talking about the same station for one sec...
27-03-2018T17:35:16,TheBeckoner,Rock is more my thing.
27-03-2018T17:35:20,Bigboi182,Same.
27-03-2018T17:35:25,TheBeckoner,Well maybe the same frequencey
27-03-2018T17:35:26,Bigboi182,I also like EDM.
27-03-2018T17:35:52,TheBeckoner,I belive they are only broadcast so far so that way more things can be broadcasted in general
27-03-2018T17:36:29,TheBeckoner,Not sure what Ken ashcorp does but I like his stuff. Electro swing is some good stuff too.
27-03-2018T17:36:32,Bigboi182,This is one of my favortites https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFWT4yfPdjo
27-03-2018T17:37:18,TheBeckoner,Pretty good. Would sound good through my subs
27-03-2018T17:37:31,Bigboi182,I Know right.
27-03-2018T17:37:35,TheBeckoner,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbQgXeY_zi4 this in one of my favorites. Weird music vid tho
27-03-2018T17:37:56,Bigboi182,I've heard this song before...
27-03-2018T17:38:10,Bigboi182,It was in a NiTW AMV...
27-03-2018T17:38:13,Bigboi182,XD
27-03-2018T17:38:59,Bigboi182,"There's one song that is supposed to be country, but it's instrumental is trap-like."
27-03-2018T17:39:30,Bigboi182,It's this one. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOP5HrIkTrA
27-03-2018T17:41:34,Bigboi182,"If it wasn't for FIFA, I wouldn't be so into EDM and other Pop-ish songs."
27-03-2018T17:41:58,Bigboi182,That's one thing EA can do right: a damn good soundtrack.
27-03-2018T17:47:03,Vatruvius,In 10 minutes you guys chat so much that I really have scroll with my phone to find my last message. But you live here Bgr so...what up Bigboi?
27-03-2018T17:47:55,TheBeckoner,"Pretty good song there Big. Its a bit country with the male vocals, but otherwise pretty good."
27-03-2018T17:50:32,Bigboi182,Nothin Much Vat.
27-03-2018T17:51:41,Bigboi182,"I swear, look at this compilation of the 30 best songs over the last 20+ FIFA games https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VtMWbRPm9g"
27-03-2018T18:01:23,Vatruvius,Loo Bigboi...I was refering to why are you chatting so much. Bgr lives here so that is his excuse.
27-03-2018T18:01:29,Vatruvius,Lol*
27-03-2018T18:01:53,TheBeckoner,Chat is free
27-03-2018T18:02:06,TheBeckoner,aside from internet and electricity costs...
27-03-2018T18:02:23,TheBeckoner,Why not chat if free to chat eh?
27-03-2018T18:03:14,Bigboi182,I just like chatting here Vat...
27-03-2018T18:03:37,Bigboi182,Unless Bgr has some room there...
27-03-2018T18:04:00,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
27-03-2018T18:04:26,Bgrmystr2,I like my room thank you very much
27-03-2018T18:04:53,Bigboi182,"Besides, this is the same internet that gives us things like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3IgwLT_mYc"
27-03-2018T18:05:10,Bgrmystr2,For now I'll be leaving said room to get something to eat. :)
27-03-2018T18:05:28,TheBeckoner,May you find good eats
27-03-2018T18:09:59,Bigboi182,Indeed.
27-03-2018T18:16:58,TheGamePlayer,ELLO!
27-03-2018T18:17:04,TheGamePlayer,caps
27-03-2018T18:18:46,Bigboi182,Sup TGP?
27-03-2018T18:19:49,TheGamePlayer,ah nothing just about to hop into a vtol jet sim for vr and learn some controls how about you?
27-03-2018T18:21:30,Bigboi182,Just hopping around this chat.
27-03-2018T18:21:54,Vatruvius,Ohh...yeah...totally did that a weeks...cause you know...I do stuff like that all the time...huh hah...
27-03-2018T18:22:02,Bigboi182,Thinking about playing Dirt 4.
27-03-2018T18:22:18,Bigboi182,We know Vat...
27-03-2018T18:22:44,Vatruvius,Know what...I have no idea what your are talking about!
27-03-2018T18:38:29,Bigboi182,Same with you.
27-03-2018T18:38:42,Bigboi182,So we're both clueless.
27-03-2018T18:43:28,Vatruvius,Have any of you played Friday the 13th?
27-03-2018T18:43:34,Bigboi182,Nope.
27-03-2018T18:44:08,Vatruvius,It is a very fun game.
27-03-2018T18:45:10,Bigboi182,"Sure, a game based on a movie about a serial killer is supposed to be FUN."
27-03-2018T18:45:35,Bigboi182,"Sorry, I'm too literal..."
27-03-2018T18:49:57,Bigboi182,"Well, at least Tom isn't lurking anymore..."
27-03-2018T18:51:15,Combak,Hey all.
27-03-2018T18:51:30,TheBeckoner,Hullo Combak
27-03-2018T18:52:26,Combak,"Hey Beck. Just going to work on HW until the stream, I guess."
27-03-2018T18:52:37,Bgrmystr2,"why would that be a good thing, Big xD"
27-03-2018T18:52:49,Bgrmystr2,"also, combak, if you didn't know, the scheduled wed streams are died"
27-03-2018T18:52:57,Bgrmystr2,now it's just a surprise
27-03-2018T18:53:24,TheBeckoner,Ah yes Comic streams are random as far as we knoe
27-03-2018T18:53:27,TheBeckoner,know*
27-03-2018T18:53:57,Bgrmystr2,"lol, they either happen or don't but there's no schedule so tom doesn't feel pressured if it's not ready yet"
27-03-2018T18:56:42,Bigboi182,"IDK Bgr, I'm just used to that..."
27-03-2018T18:57:45,Bigboi182,"Besides, I doubt the fact that he's gonna have a stream..."
27-03-2018T18:57:56,Bigboi182,We'll just find out...
27-03-2018T18:58:36,Bgrmystr2,it's only 7pm
27-03-2018T18:58:58,Bgrmystr2,and he sometimes restarts his pc before the stream begins
27-03-2018T18:59:26,Bgrmystr2,"9pm eastern is about an hr from now, 8pm for me"
27-03-2018T18:59:44,Bgrmystr2,there's still time
27-03-2018T19:04:00,Vatruvius,How many people do you guess are going to show up for the stream today Bgr? I have a feeling we will spend quite a bit of our time saying there is no stream scheduled.
27-03-2018T19:06:24,Bigboi182,Probably 40 or so.
27-03-2018T19:06:49,Bigboi182,Since the comic stream happens on a random day...
27-03-2018T19:07:02,Bgrmystr2,"""going to show up for the stream"" you say that like you expect one xD"
27-03-2018T19:07:54,Bgrmystr2,"because tom didn't announce it during a stream, but in the chat, a lot of people out there probably still won't know"
27-03-2018T19:08:10,Bgrmystr2,cuz too many people either use phones or completely ignore the schedule banner
27-03-2018T19:08:41,Vatruvius,I say that like so many expect one to happen. I am not implying there is going to be a stream...stop taking my words out of context Bgr!
27-03-2018T19:08:52,Bgrmystr2,It's not out of context o.O
27-03-2018T19:08:57,Bgrmystr2,you're the one putting it in that context
27-03-2018T19:10:01,Combak,"... Huh, so the Wed. stream IS out of the schedule."
27-03-2018T19:10:02,Vatruvius,Okay...I reread my sentence and I will give you that one. In my head I was thinking of people showing up to find no stream because they are no longer happened today.
27-03-2018T19:10:20,Vatruvius,happening*
27-03-2018T19:10:22,Combak,"Oh well, I'll still hang around in case Tom does get it ready in time."
27-03-2018T19:10:28,Combak,"Otherwise, I'll miss it. XD"
27-03-2018T19:11:16,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: Yeah I think better would be asking how many ppl showing up expecting a stream (instead of showing up for the stream) as the latter still implies the stream is stilla thing
27-03-2018T19:11:35,WIPKING,possible stream today?
27-03-2018T19:11:41,Bgrmystr2,possible.
27-03-2018T19:11:45,Bgrmystr2,but we don't know
27-03-2018T19:11:54,Bgrmystr2,Stream is possible any day.
27-03-2018T19:11:55,WIPKING,well we will never know
27-03-2018T19:12:15,TheBeckoner,We'll know when we know.
27-03-2018T19:12:17,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, you could ask that question any day and the answer would always be yes xD"
27-03-2018T19:12:26,WIPKING,but it has to start soon if there is one right
27-03-2018T19:12:40,Bgrmystr2,I guess depends on 'soon'
27-03-2018T19:12:46,WIPKING,45 mines
27-03-2018T19:12:48,WIPKING,mins
27-03-2018T19:13:12,Bgrmystr2,"that's the original schedule, yeah"
27-03-2018T19:13:29,Bgrmystr2,but it's been a bit since tom left so
27-03-2018T19:13:42,Bgrmystr2,he may be out of the house or some such
27-03-2018T19:13:46,WIPKING,when did he leave
27-03-2018T19:13:53,Bgrmystr2,hmm lemmy look
27-03-2018T19:14:43,Bgrmystr2,about 2 hours ago or so
27-03-2018T19:14:47,Vatruvius,You have that time stamped Bgr?
27-03-2018T19:14:56,WIPKING,its been fourdays since last stream so likly one today or most likly thursday and a definite friday
27-03-2018T19:15:16,WIPKING,spelling*
27-03-2018T19:15:21,Bgrmystr2,That was when someone saw tom not being in the chat
27-03-2018T19:15:24,Vatruvius,Or Tom decided to make his life a little easy and do the page stream Friday.
27-03-2018T19:15:28,Bgrmystr2,"and yes, Vatru, I have the timestamps on"
27-03-2018T19:15:39,Bgrmystr2,but they're on UTC I believe.. for some stupid reason
27-03-2018T19:15:43,Bgrmystr2,and there's no way to change them
27-03-2018T19:16:01,WIPKING,hope there is one today cause i wont been on untill monday
27-03-2018T19:16:06,Vatruvius,UTC?
27-03-2018T19:16:15,Bgrmystr2,UTC is a time zone lol
27-03-2018T19:16:23,Vatruvius,I know...which one?
27-03-2018T19:16:30,WIPKING,right now im in pacific
27-03-2018T19:16:41,Bgrmystr2,https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone/utc The one everyone bases their clocks around.
27-03-2018T19:16:49,Bgrmystr2,literally 0 hour
27-03-2018T19:17:42,Vatruvius,I believe UTC is the time where you are right now. So your timestamps will differ from my timestamps.
27-03-2018T19:17:55,Bigboi182,"Since the comic stream has been taken out of context, you have to keep your eyes open, or you'll miss it."
27-03-2018T19:18:47,WIPKING,no duh
27-03-2018T19:18:58,WIPKING,i missed the last three
27-03-2018T19:19:02,Bgrmystr2,UTC is not the time zone I'm at. It's literally the central time that everyone runs their clock off https://www.timeanddate.com/time/aboututc.html
27-03-2018T19:19:14,Bgrmystr2,"it is, however, the time zone that my picarto uses"
27-03-2018T19:19:18,Bgrmystr2,for some reason
27-03-2018T19:19:19,Bigboi182,Which is what I've been doing for the past week.
27-03-2018T19:20:12,Bgrmystr2,"WIP, it's not difficult. There's a stream on Fri and a stream on Sun. The comic has no schedule now and will be done whenever tom has it prepared."
27-03-2018T19:20:19,Bgrmystr2,"it could be wed, could be tues, could be fri"
27-03-2018T19:20:31,Bgrmystr2,he may not stream it at all
27-03-2018T19:20:34,Bgrmystr2,who knows
27-03-2018T19:20:53,WIPKING,"im grounded at certain times, im still a 13 year old with bad grades"
27-03-2018T19:21:18,WIPKING,today i have school work and not suposed to be on thi sright now
27-03-2018T19:21:25,Bgrmystr2,well it's not like the current stream times are gonna change
27-03-2018T19:21:26,Vatruvius,So UTC is the 24 hour clock. That way everyone in the world is at the correct time. In that case...yes...Picarto is on UTC but all the timestamps in the chat read according to my time so it is user specific.
27-03-2018T19:21:55,Bgrmystr2,"yeah it's user-specific, Vatru. Zro's has his time zone too"
27-03-2018T19:22:00,Bgrmystr2,but mine does not
27-03-2018T19:22:09,Bgrmystr2,so I have no idea
27-03-2018T19:22:25,Bgrmystr2,there is no setting to change the clock
27-03-2018T19:22:26,Vatruvius,Hmm...
27-03-2018T19:22:42,WIPKING,i memoriezed the time zones
27-03-2018T19:22:49,Vatruvius,Perhaps it is linked to the location you set in your account settings?
27-03-2018T19:22:56,WIPKING,regular streams in my town are 7 pm
27-03-2018T19:23:00,Bgrmystr2,"unlikely, vatru"
27-03-2018T19:23:15,WIPKING,so where ever i go i add or subtract hours
27-03-2018T19:23:22,WIPKING,simple
27-03-2018T19:23:23,TheBeckoner,"Mine is correct but reads in military time, I assume they all do?"
27-03-2018T19:23:26,Bgrmystr2,location has a country
27-03-2018T19:23:29,Bgrmystr2,that's it
27-03-2018T19:23:40,Bgrmystr2,the US has several time zones
27-03-2018T19:23:51,Vatruvius,Well...can't solve your problem then Bgr
27-03-2018T19:23:55,Vatruvius,But you live here so...
27-03-2018T19:24:07,WIPKING,ive got my time zone down
27-03-2018T19:24:23,Bgrmystr2,it's a picarto problem
27-03-2018T19:24:32,Bgrmystr2,there's literally nothing I can do about it
27-03-2018T19:24:46,Bgrmystr2,"there's no option to change it, and relogging does nothing"
27-03-2018T19:24:51,Bgrmystr2,clearing cache does nothing
27-03-2018T19:24:59,WIPKING,dont use the picato clock use a moblie device or clock
27-03-2018T19:25:01,Bgrmystr2,"it's stuck that way, and I have no control over it lol"
27-03-2018T19:25:09,Bgrmystr2,"I'm on a computer, WIP, but that's not relevant"
27-03-2018T19:25:13,WIPKING,so am i
27-03-2018T19:25:26,Bgrmystr2,cuz the chat timestamps are what I'm using to tell when things happened
27-03-2018T19:25:32,Bgrmystr2,cuz it's in the chat
27-03-2018T19:25:49,WIPKING,i know that a art starts at 9 pm somewhere else but tarts at 6 pm wheer i am
27-03-2018T19:26:55,Vatruvius,Well I got to go do dishes...don't have too much fun without me!
27-03-2018T19:27:05,WIPKING,what fun
27-03-2018T19:27:40,Vatruvius,Yes...lots. You can join me if you want WIP
27-03-2018T19:28:02,WIPKING,doing school work right now sorry
27-03-2018T19:29:21,Bigboi182,Yay dishes! So... Much... Fun...
27-03-2018T19:29:50,WIPKING,it take slike 5 mins
27-03-2018T19:30:44,Bigboi182,It's STILL not fun...
27-03-2018T19:31:58,WIPKING,:expressionless:
27-03-2018T19:37:16,WIPKING,watch imma predict the furture
27-03-2018T19:37:33,WIPKING,future*
27-03-2018T19:38:29,WIPKING,there WILL NOT BE A STREAM TODAY BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE THE OLD SCEDULE!!
27-03-2018T19:41:12,Bigboi182,Wow.
27-03-2018T19:41:21,Bigboi182,What a great prediction.
27-03-2018T19:41:26,Bigboi182,I applaud you.
27-03-2018T19:41:38,Bigboi182,I wonder what made you think that...
27-03-2018T19:41:41,WIPKING,:sunglasses:
27-03-2018T19:41:51,Bgrmystr2,"WIP, you do know that there can easily be a stream today and it doesn't make any difference what the old schedule was"
27-03-2018T19:41:55,Bgrmystr2,xD
27-03-2018T19:42:14,Bigboi182,Thanks for backing me up Bgr.
27-03-2018T19:42:27,WIPKING,The probability is 1000000 to 21\
27-03-2018T19:42:41,WIPKING,that there wont be one tody
27-03-2018T19:43:09,Bigboi182,It's not that odd...
27-03-2018T19:43:22,WIPKING,Typing fast = spelling errors.
27-03-2018T19:43:25,WIPKING,lol
27-03-2018T19:43:43,Bigboi182,"Considering how unpredictable Tom can be, it can happen at any time, even now..."
27-03-2018T19:44:26,WIPKING,BUT  why would he stream on a day that used to be for the comics
27-03-2018T19:44:36,WIPKING,huh
27-03-2018T19:45:35,Bgrmystr2,because it makes no difference what the schedule was lol
27-03-2018T19:45:49,WIPKING,there is big differnce
27-03-2018T19:46:03,Bgrmystr2,"we're not comparing stuff, man"
27-03-2018T19:46:10,Bgrmystr2,there is no comparison. xD
27-03-2018T19:47:08,Bgrmystr2,"what happens if next week, the comic is ready to be colored wed night? Would he wait till thurs simply cuz Wed was the old schedule?"
27-03-2018T19:47:11,Bgrmystr2,no
27-03-2018T19:47:20,WIPKING,"he change the schedule on thursday, saying no more wed. comic streams, he has art and sketches scheduled but not comics"
27-03-2018T19:47:51,WIPKING,it used to be on wed.
27-03-2018T19:48:21,WIPKING,but if he streams today for a comic hen why did he change the schedule at all
27-03-2018T19:48:26,Bgrmystr2,"He also went on to say that the comic streams will be done when they're done, and he'll have more freedom and versatility"
27-03-2018T19:48:56,Bgrmystr2,because it's about not having to NEED to stream on every single wed no matter what
27-03-2018T19:49:09,Bgrmystr2,the comic isn't always ready on wed
27-03-2018T19:49:17,Bgrmystr2,"sometimes it's ready earlier, sometimes later"
27-03-2018T19:49:31,WIPKING,if he streams today than why did he even change the schedule. THATS ALL IM SAYING
27-03-2018T19:49:38,Bgrmystr2,removing the schedule allows tom to stream the comic being done when it's ready
27-03-2018T19:49:48,Bgrmystr2,I literaly just answered that.
27-03-2018T19:49:55,Bgrmystr2,read what I said mate
27-03-2018T19:50:02,WIPKING,m8 bye
27-03-2018T19:50:13,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
27-03-2018T19:52:19,WIPKING,still predictied the future
27-03-2018T19:53:18,Bgrmystr2,"thanks for predicting the future that anyone could have guessed. May you ever grace our presence again, we would be ever in your debt, Captain Obvious. :ptv-greetings:"
27-03-2018T19:53:35,WIPKING,tank u

27-03-2018T19:54:45,WIPKING,i really meant to say tank
27-03-2018T19:55:02,Bgrmystr2,one singular tank? Only one? :ptv-wondering:
27-03-2018T19:55:06,WIPKING,as ini was being a cute 2 year old saying thank your
27-03-2018T19:55:08,Bgrmystr2,hmm

27-03-2018T19:55:48,Bgrmystr2,Will have to get back to you on that. Lotta good tanks out there.
27-03-2018T19:56:20,WIPKING,as in quoting Nogla from the vanoss crew
27-03-2018T19:57:28,WIPKING,your just trying to get me mad about you think that i said tTank as in the war car
27-03-2018T19:58:25,WIPKING,"ALRIGHT..... SO, WISE GUY I AM MAD..... GET OFF MY LAWN!"
27-03-2018T19:58:32,Bigboi182,Ok...
27-03-2018T19:58:39,WIPKING,not you
27-03-2018T19:58:44,WIPKING,Bgr
27-03-2018T19:58:45,Bigboi182,Imma just go for a bit...
27-03-2018T19:59:07,WIPKING,so far i am right
27-03-2018T19:59:10,WIPKING,noooooo stream
27-03-2018T20:00:34,Bigboi182,Just you wait...
27-03-2018T20:00:43,WIPKING,its 9 pm
27-03-2018T20:00:48,Bigboi182,Tom doesn't let people down.
27-03-2018T20:00:58,Bigboi182,Don't be impatient.
27-03-2018T20:00:59,WIPKING,im not saying that
27-03-2018T20:01:15,Bigboi182,"Bgr, back me up here!"
27-03-2018T20:01:22,WIPKING,i just predictied the furture
27-03-2018T20:01:24,Bigboi182,I'm getting cornered!
27-03-2018T20:01:30,WIPKING,no stream today
27-03-2018T20:01:33,Bigboi182,Not true.
27-03-2018T20:01:36,Bigboi182,Yet.
27-03-2018T20:01:38,WIPKING,really
27-03-2018T20:02:00,WIPKING,so hes going to start streaming at 10 or 11pm for 3 hours
27-03-2018T20:02:26,Bgrmystr2,haha your lawn. WIP pls
27-03-2018T20:02:39,Bigboi182,Maybe...
27-03-2018T20:02:52,WIPKING,NO
27-03-2018T20:02:56,WIPKING,he needs sleep
27-03-2018T20:03:07,Bigboi182,He's had sleep.
27-03-2018T20:03:15,WIPKING,a least 8 hours of it
27-03-2018T20:03:15,Bgrmystr2,"Tom doesn't sleep till like 4 or 5 am, generally."
27-03-2018T20:03:27,Bgrmystr2,and he gets plenty of sleep :u
27-03-2018T20:03:36,Bgrmystr2,"or at least, he should &gt;:T"
27-03-2018T20:03:50,WIPKING,how old are u
27-03-2018T20:03:57,Bgrmystr2,Older than you :V
27-03-2018T20:04:00,Bigboi182,Tom knows what he's doing.
27-03-2018T20:04:02,WIPKING,no der
27-03-2018T20:04:06,Bigboi182,Same as me.
27-03-2018T20:04:11,Bigboi182,Well no.
27-03-2018T20:04:14,WIPKING,off course he does
27-03-2018T20:04:19,Bgrmystr2,"I'm gonna be 30 this year, bro"
27-03-2018T20:04:29,Bigboi182,I meant same with me.
27-03-2018T20:04:36,Bgrmystr2,oldfacemystr2
27-03-2018T20:04:38,Bigboi182,That was a REALLY bad typo.
27-03-2018T20:05:17,WIPKING,but there is not going to be  astream today becaus ehe change the schedule so taht there was no streams on wed. so there wont be one today
27-03-2018T20:05:37,Bgrmystr2,"that's not what he did, no"
27-03-2018T20:05:49,Bgrmystr2,you seem to not understand the change of schedule
27-03-2018T20:05:50,WIPKING,wat did he do
27-03-2018T20:06:13,Bgrmystr2,the only thing tom did was cancel the scheduled streams on wed so he's not /obligated/ by a schedule to stream on wednesday
27-03-2018T20:06:21,Bgrmystr2,"he can still stream on wed, but he doesn't HAVE to"
27-03-2018T20:06:40,Bgrmystr2,and people won't come to the stream page on wed expecting one and be disappointed when there isn't a stream
27-03-2018T20:06:43,WIPKING,wow in 5 hours there wont be a stream
27-03-2018T20:07:02,WIPKING,but there will be oen tomarrow
27-03-2018T20:07:08,WIPKING,and ill miss it
27-03-2018T20:07:20,WIPKING,even the one on easter
27-03-2018T20:08:09,Bigboi182,Yeah.
27-03-2018T20:08:27,Bigboi182,That's the beauty of streams.
27-03-2018T20:08:43,WIPKING,WRONG THAT IS THE HELL OF THEM
27-03-2018T20:09:04,Bigboi182,Oh boy... Here we go...
27-03-2018T20:11:44,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: Big, I have a confuse."
27-03-2018T20:11:59,WIPKING,what is a confuse
27-03-2018T20:12:17,Bgrmystr2,that's my brain after reading what was left of your statement after you butchered it. :P
27-03-2018T20:12:31,WIPKING,good
27-03-2018T20:14:04,WIPKING,Does anyone know when the book version of twokinds vol. 4 will be out
27-03-2018T20:14:11,Bigboi182,No idea!
27-03-2018T20:14:13,WIPKING,or vol. 5
27-03-2018T20:14:17,WIPKING,or vol. 6
27-03-2018T20:14:22,WIPKING,or vol.7
27-03-2018T20:14:35,Bigboi182,STILL no idea!
27-03-2018T20:14:57,Bigboi182,But let's not go THAT far.
27-03-2018T20:15:11,Vatruvius,Not in your lifetime...you will die before the end of Twokinds. :P
27-03-2018T20:15:30,Bigboi182,Oh hey Vat!
27-03-2018T20:15:44,Vatruvius,Yeah...I finished those dishes.
27-03-2018T20:15:56,Bigboi182,"Please help me explain the whole ""livestream situation"""
27-03-2018T20:16:16,Bigboi182,Yeah... An hour and a half later XD
27-03-2018T20:17:15,WIPKING,i accully did the math one month in the twokinds comic is 7 years. So if 1 year in teh comic is 84 years than 10 more years inthe comic is 840 years. AT THE RATE THAT TOM IS MAKING THE COMIC
27-03-2018T20:17:22,Bgrmystr2,"it won't work, Big"
27-03-2018T20:17:53,Bgrmystr2,Wip is too far gone at this point xD
27-03-2018T20:18:08,WIPKING,well if you want to know when it ends
27-03-2018T20:18:19,WIPKING,it will be in 2918
27-03-2018T20:18:41,WIPKING,or some waht around there
27-03-2018T20:19:05,WIPKING,good bye
27-03-2018T20:19:19,Bigboi182,"Yeah, he's looooong gone now..."
27-03-2018T20:19:19,Vatruvius,Tom's current schedule is to stream art stuff Friday...whatever that needs to be done...and the sketch/color stream on Sunday. If he streams any other time it is purely because he can. This helps him relieve stress.
27-03-2018T20:19:30,WIPKING,nope wrong bye
27-03-2018T20:19:43,Bgrmystr2,and this is why WIP is too far gone
27-03-2018T20:19:44,Bigboi182,XD
27-03-2018T20:19:53,Vatruvius,Welp...I tried.
27-03-2018T20:19:58,Bgrmystr2,"you did, vatru."
27-03-2018T20:20:04,Bigboi182,I think we've broke him...
27-03-2018T20:20:24,Vatruvius,1 down...39 to go...
27-03-2018T20:20:29,Bigboi182,Now imagine if he actually has a stream right now...
27-03-2018T20:20:33,Vatruvius,*sigh*
27-03-2018T20:20:37,Vatruvius,lol
27-03-2018T20:20:38,Bgrmystr2,"lol, we didn't break him Big."
27-03-2018T20:20:42,Bgrmystr2,He was broken to begin with
27-03-2018T20:20:54,Bigboi182,"True, true."
27-03-2018T20:21:05,Bigboi182,And at such a young age too...
27-03-2018T20:21:39,Vatruvius,I was typing that paragraph while suffering from brain freeze from eating the pop-sickle I had super fast to be able to type.
27-03-2018T20:21:44,Bigboi182,"Eh, I'm sure he'll be fine..."
27-03-2018T20:21:51,Bgrmystr2,"well, no, big, that's the entire reason /why/ he's so far gone. xD"
27-03-2018T20:21:52,Bigboi182,...Right?
27-03-2018T20:22:32,Bigboi182,"Well, at least we made the effort."
27-03-2018T20:22:50,Bigboi182,Now I'm gonna go eat before more sh*t hits the fan.
27-03-2018T20:25:53,Vatruvius,lol...I am watching Ohmwrecker play Friday the 13th at two times speed...makes it really funny to watch.
27-03-2018T20:30:09,Bigboi182,Ok I'm back
27-03-2018T20:30:43,Bigboi182,With Sugary Corn Flakes.
27-03-2018T20:31:15,Bigboi182,Because Screw my health! I can burn this off in minutes.
27-03-2018T20:31:36,Dadrobit,Howdy y'll.
27-03-2018T20:31:39,Dadrobit,y'all
27-03-2018T20:31:44,BadFoMo,Yo.
27-03-2018T20:31:46,Bigboi182,Sup Dad
27-03-2018T20:31:55,Bigboi182,And FoMo
27-03-2018T20:32:04,Vatruvius,Hello!
27-03-2018T20:32:15,Bigboi182,You two just missed something truly intersting
27-03-2018T20:32:33,Dadrobit,No unfortunately I did not.
27-03-2018T20:32:38,TheBeckoner,Heyo Robit
27-03-2018T20:32:48,Bigboi182,You saw all of that?
27-03-2018T20:32:58,Dadrobit,Much to my dismay.
27-03-2018T20:33:09,Bigboi182,So why didn't you help?
27-03-2018T20:33:29,Dadrobit,"Just got home a half hour ago, posted as soon as I was caught up."
27-03-2018T20:33:40,Bigboi182,Oh...
27-03-2018T20:34:14,Bigboi182,Got home just in time to see a kid go insane over a schedule...
27-03-2018T20:34:26,Bgrmystr2,"My condolences, Dadro"
27-03-2018T20:34:30,Bgrmystr2,:&lt;
27-03-2018T20:34:55,Bgrmystr2,"many tries were had, but unfortunately.. to no avail."
27-03-2018T20:35:07,Bigboi182,Yeah...
27-03-2018T20:35:48,Bigboi182,That Kid's mind was somewhere else...
27-03-2018T20:35:59,Vatruvius,I am starting to feel better going off to do dishes.
27-03-2018T20:35:59,Dadrobit,"So, when's Tom gonna start streaming tonight?"
27-03-2018T20:36:07,Vatruvius,:ptv-angry:
27-03-2018T20:36:10,Bigboi182,no clue
27-03-2018T20:36:25,Bigboi182,PLEASE don't start this up again.
27-03-2018T20:36:28,Bigboi182,PLEASE.
27-03-2018T20:36:32,Bgrmystr2,xD Dadro pls
27-03-2018T20:36:42,Vatruvius,YOU WILL BREAK ME!
27-03-2018T20:37:00,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
27-03-2018T20:37:03,Bigboi182,You won't like Vat when he's angry...
27-03-2018T20:37:21,Bgrmystr2,"yeah yeah, heard that befor :P"
27-03-2018T20:37:24,Bgrmystr2,before*
27-03-2018T20:38:02,Bigboi182,I won't be suprised when Vat goes full Hulk on Dad...
27-03-2018T20:38:16,Bgrmystr2,He's just teasing lol
27-03-2018T20:38:26,Bigboi182,I know...
27-03-2018T20:38:31,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Whelp... I'll ba back later
27-03-2018T20:38:34,ItsActuallyKopyKat,be*
27-03-2018T20:38:53,Dadrobit,cya
27-03-2018T20:38:59,Bigboi182,I did not see Kat...
27-03-2018T20:39:12,Bgrmystr2,I saw KopyKat
27-03-2018T20:39:44,Vatruvius,I do not get angry very easy...unless it is WoT dicking me. The reason why I do not get angry very easily is because if I do it will reduce the time until the end of the world. Luckily...WoT does not count.
27-03-2018T20:39:53,Vatruvius,:ptv-tease:
27-03-2018T20:40:58,Bigboi182,So you're basically the Hulk?
27-03-2018T20:41:21,Vatruvius,Yes...
27-03-2018T20:41:36,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: mhm yeah okay
27-03-2018T20:41:40,Bigboi182,Oh boy...
27-03-2018T20:43:09,Vatruvius,Fortunately Twokinds is the only thing to calm me down and this is the Twokinds chat...so we are safe for now.
27-03-2018T20:43:17,Bigboi182,Good...
27-03-2018T20:43:28,Bigboi182,I'mma step out for a bit...
27-03-2018T20:43:43,Vatruvius,But if for some reason I could no longer see sleeping Flora or a stream...that is it.
27-03-2018T20:44:05,Bigboi182,And will try not to rage on Dirt 4...
27-03-2018T20:59:20,Bgrmystr2,I don't suppose any of you have a solid grasp of city planning / transportation engineering?
27-03-2018T21:05:36,Vatruvius,Does Simcity count? :ptv-scratch:
27-03-2018T21:06:31,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, but only to the extent of like.. expansive regional cities on SimCity 4, or even that new game uhh"
27-03-2018T21:06:36,Bgrmystr2,goddamn what is it called
27-03-2018T21:07:46,Bgrmystr2,Cities Skylines that's it
27-03-2018T21:07:49,Vatruvius,I know what you are talking about...I do not remember its name either but is rather large and you can do just about anything in it. In that case not really but I do understand transportation. I can certainly offer some ideas.
27-03-2018T21:07:49,Bgrmystr2,that one as well
27-03-2018T21:07:54,Vatruvius,That's the one.
27-03-2018T21:08:43,Bgrmystr2,"Basically, I've got a map on SimCity 4 and I've been running into problems trying to get sims from the edge of the map to the center of the city"
27-03-2018T21:08:53,Bgrmystr2,and it's obvious my original highway design is flawed
27-03-2018T21:09:25,Bgrmystr2,but I'm  attemping to figure out how to un-flaw it and so far I dunno what kind of plan to go for
27-03-2018T21:10:24,Bgrmystr2,so I've been dicking around in Fireworks trying to lay out some highway over an image of the regional map
27-03-2018T21:11:00,Vatruvius,Well...in the new Simcity I would just demolish the city and restart without making that mistake but another way you can go about doing it is creating a new highway and slowly beef up that one and phase out the flawed one.
27-03-2018T21:11:02,Bgrmystr2,and trying to see if I can identify a better layout of my highway system based on the original map I'm basing it on
27-03-2018T21:11:14,Vatruvius,You have a picture I can look at?
27-03-2018T21:12:19,Bgrmystr2,"Oh, I'm not talking about phasing out a new highway, I'm talking about redesigning half a region of highway, like 4 or 5 large maps worth of highway"
27-03-2018T21:12:40,Bgrmystr2,I can save what I'm workin on in a PSD file if you want ;u
27-03-2018T21:12:45,Vatruvius,"I am not sure about Simcity 4, but in Simcity the Sims like to take the shortest route...not the obvious, let's take the highway, route. So I have to design my cities with the intent of making routes long to get to home but short between major"
27-03-2018T21:12:53,Vatruvius,thoroughfares.
27-03-2018T21:13:14,Vatruvius,That would help...gives me a sense of what you are trying to do.
27-03-2018T21:13:19,Bgrmystr2,yeh I have a bunch of custom addons that highly change the way the sims move
27-03-2018T21:13:28,Vatruvius,Good...
27-03-2018T21:13:47,Bgrmystr2,"originally, in SC4, sims would end up taking the shortest route.. which ended up creating an endless loop in the corners of cities"
27-03-2018T21:14:04,Bgrmystr2,where it's closer to go to the next city over than it is to travel to the other side of the same city to go to a job
27-03-2018T21:14:09,Bgrmystr2,that was a major bug
27-03-2018T21:14:17,Vatruvius,"Sim, ""Time to go to work...let's see here...I will take a left, right, right, left, left, left, right, 29 traffic lights, and I am there."""
27-03-2018T21:14:30,Bgrmystr2,so I basically lowered the amount of ppl using the 'closest route' to 1% of the population
27-03-2018T21:14:38,Vatruvius,"Me, ""You idiot, just take the 8 lane road that goes straight there with 1 traffic light!"""
27-03-2018T21:14:53,Bgrmystr2,xD yeah the traffic in the new SimCity is trash
27-03-2018T22:19:01,TheBeckoner,Is Tom streaming today???? /t
27-03-2018T22:20:53,Dadrobit,"Ayyyyy, just found out I have a new niece."
27-03-2018T22:21:04,Dadrobit,Elizabeth Rose So-and-So.
27-03-2018T22:22:37,Vatruvius,Tom is still off and we have heard no word so I am guessing no stream.
27-03-2018T22:22:57,Vatruvius,Congrats Dadrobit!
27-03-2018T22:58:36,TheBeckoner,Congrats Robit. Make sure she follows your lead and grows the appropriate beard.
27-03-2018T22:58:55,Bgrmystr2,:open_mouth: Grats Dadro
