03-09-2018T01:18:33,SpazztasticKiwi,None of us can spell
03-09-2018T01:19:05,Bgrmystr2,"Hey, that's not true. I can spell."
03-09-2018T01:19:23,Bgrmystr2,"Sometimes, I just can't fingers."
03-09-2018T01:22:15,TheBeckoner,Bgr needs more practice fingering
03-09-2018T01:22:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Word choice is important
03-09-2018T01:22:31,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-ohmy: beck pls
03-09-2018T01:23:10,Bgrmystr2,"besides, that's also not true. I played the saxophone for several years and have a very high wpm typing."

03-09-2018T01:24:54,SpazztasticKiwi,My issue is my phone like “this is totally the word you meant instead” or even better “that looks fine”
03-09-2018T01:26:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"It comes out like, “accordion to studies, few people notice when you replace certain words with instruments”"
03-09-2018T01:26:49,Bgrmystr2,"Hey, it could be worse.. you phone could have a screwed up word suggestion and finish your sentences with the wrong strawberry."
03-09-2018T01:27:30,Bgrmystr2,:smirk:
03-09-2018T01:27:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Sometimes I imagine a little creature in my phone that looks like this :ptv-SteelwormHades:
03-09-2018T01:27:59,SpazztasticKiwi,That is my autocorrect
03-09-2018T01:28:40,SpazztasticKiwi,“I werd good”
03-09-2018T01:29:48,TheBeckoner,What is that emoji anyhow? An ice cream sundae with a body?
03-09-2018T01:29:54,TheBeckoner,I can never figure it out
03-09-2018T01:30:11,TheBeckoner,Also typing in pure predictive text can be real fun
03-09-2018T01:30:26,TheBeckoner,especially if you do it to people without warning
03-09-2018T01:30:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t even get me started on auto fill
03-09-2018T01:30:38,Bgrmystr2,do you really not know the mascot of Picarto?
03-09-2018T01:31:32,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s like that one person you play charades with that’s waaaay too over eager and into it
03-09-2018T01:32:44,Bgrmystr2,"""Ice cream sundae"" lol.."
03-09-2018T01:32:46,Bgrmystr2,https://picarto.tv/site/mascot
03-09-2018T01:32:59,Bgrmystr2,"The site's mascot is Mimi, and that's all the lil icons of the girl"
03-09-2018T01:33:39,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, that one looks kind of like a horse head"
03-09-2018T01:35:35,SpazztasticKiwi,BumBum the hammer? That’s a nickname Mark uses
03-09-2018T01:35:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Without the hammer part
03-09-2018T01:37:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Brushie is stinkin adorable
03-09-2018T01:38:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Has there been a sketch with Nibbly stealing Eric’s paint brushes and running rampant with them
03-09-2018T01:40:30,Bgrmystr2,right? I like brushy too.
03-09-2018T01:40:32,Bgrmystr2,and no
03-09-2018T01:40:38,Bgrmystr2,nothing like that
03-09-2018T01:42:50,SpazztasticKiwi,That’d be interesting to see
03-09-2018T01:43:01,SpazztasticKiwi,“She’s just expressing herself”
03-09-2018T01:43:14,SpazztasticKiwi,“SHE PAINTED THE WHOLE FLOOR”

03-09-2018T22:59:01,shamdow,seems it.
03-09-2018T22:59:05,Ordithus,I don't think TDM was ever offered in hardback
03-09-2018T22:59:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Nibbly has the sass
03-09-2018T22:59:23,SpazztasticKiwi,All of it
03-09-2018T22:59:54,shamdow,"hahahah. its worth $5.99, and postage to where I am is $15.25. and this is probbably USD too lol"
03-09-2018T22:59:59,Bgrmystr2,hm? Aren't there images of Tom at conventions w/ hardbacks of TDM?
03-09-2018T23:00:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Pictures of Tom don’t exist. They’re a myth
03-09-2018T23:00:37,Twokinds,Hardback?
03-09-2018T23:00:41,Twokinds,It's only 24 pages
03-09-2018T23:00:49,Twokinds,That'd be a thin hardback
03-09-2018T23:01:01,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, aren't all the other books hardback too?"
03-09-2018T23:04:38,Ordithus,vols 1-4 and the artbook are
03-09-2018T23:04:54,Ordithus,They are all more than 24 pages
03-09-2018T23:04:56,Bgrmystr2,"I know the artbook is for sure, cuz I have it in hardback"
03-09-2018T23:05:14,Ordithus,I don't know if 1 and 2 are just a more recent thing to be hard
03-09-2018T23:06:19,shamdow,"ive got 1, 2, 3 and art in hardback allready. 4th will be on its way soon (waiting for it lol) im just having a look at what else i can get"

03-09-2018T23:51:51,TorqueEmUp,"speaking on the sore on the tongue, that's gotta SUCK, bad enough having them on the inside of your lip when you accidently bite your lip, and your tougnue. oof I feel for ya."
03-09-2018T23:53:26,TorqueEmUp,"Wow, I made very little sense there."
03-09-2018T23:56:27,TorqueEmUp,"I'll see myself out, and return once my brain starts to actually function."
