05-01-2018T02:45:44,Mihari,"Granted, that's young and old versions of her, but yah, that's Dove."
05-01-2018T02:45:58,Kezzy,wish i could draw D:
05-01-2018T02:45:59,Bgrmystr2,Gnight Rex
05-01-2018T02:46:00,MidnightBlue78,super cute!!!
05-01-2018T02:46:01,Ordithus,cute
05-01-2018T02:46:14,DarthRexKing,You said you were leaving too.
05-01-2018T02:46:33,SageSaga,i have a Pseudo character in the game too- a character based on one I used for a different game
05-01-2018T02:46:49,Mihari,My arch-nemesis!
05-01-2018T02:46:56,SageSaga,hes friendly!
05-01-2018T02:46:59,DarthRexKing,"Goodnight, midnight. Sleep well too."
05-01-2018T02:47:00,Mihari,XD
05-01-2018T02:47:06,Bgrmystr2,"Midnight should have lost the ""I"" and it would have made sense :P"
05-01-2018T02:47:16,MidnightBlue78,"ok, ok jeez"
05-01-2018T02:47:16,DarthRexKing,I what?
05-01-2018T02:47:31,Bgrmystr2,"I thought you were leaving, Rex? :O"
05-01-2018T02:47:32,MidnightBlue78,I guess I did a fail
05-01-2018T02:47:42,Bgrmystr2,"ya missed, midnight :P"
05-01-2018T02:47:48,MidnightBlue78,yep
05-01-2018T02:48:03,DarthRexKing,"Midnight is still here, but he or she is leaving for sleep like me."
05-01-2018T02:48:14,Kezzy,boi go to sleep
05-01-2018T02:48:14,MidnightBlue78,I am not leaving
05-01-2018T02:48:16,SageSaga,"my ""character"" is Ebonwell, he is a scientist and has the power of gravity manipulation to the point of being able to create wormholes"
05-01-2018T02:48:18,DarthRexKing,Enjoy the stream ya'll.
05-01-2018T02:48:19,Ordithus,The troll has become the trolled
05-01-2018T02:48:20,MidnightBlue78,:ctwokinds-flomad:
05-01-2018T02:48:27,DarthRexKing,You just said you were.
05-01-2018T02:48:27,MidnightBlue78,hehehe
05-01-2018T02:48:39,Kezzy,"ima leave now to sleep, peace out"
05-01-2018T02:48:45,MidnightBlue78,ay Sandunga
05-01-2018T02:48:46,Ordithus,night kezzy
05-01-2018T02:48:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Kezzy
05-01-2018T02:48:51,DarthRexKing,"What troll? Boot their ass out of here, we don't need their scum. Kill the lot of the bastards."
05-01-2018T02:48:57,TheBeckoner,Wot
05-01-2018T02:48:57,Bgrmystr2,"Rex, it was a joke because you called yourself am leaving :P"
05-01-2018T02:49:09,TheBeckoner,&gt;dad joke ftw
05-01-2018T02:49:11,DarthRexKing,Later. Dream of killing trolls tonight.
05-01-2018T02:49:23,MidnightBlue78,Kill them all !!!!
05-01-2018T02:49:23,Bgrmystr2,"not only did midnight fail the joke, but you didn't get it anyway xD"
05-01-2018T02:49:23,Ordithus,bye rex!  sweet dreams
05-01-2018T02:49:24,DarthRexKing,I missed your joke bgr.
05-01-2018T02:49:30,Serpentfrog,Killing monsters.
05-01-2018T02:49:31,Bgrmystr2,"I didn't make a joke, midnight did"
05-01-2018T02:49:32,TheBeckoner,"Gn Rex, again"
05-01-2018T02:49:34,MidnightBlue78,double fail
05-01-2018T02:49:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Rex
05-01-2018T02:49:37,DarthRexKing,???
05-01-2018T02:49:37,SageSaga,hes kinda like Dove in the sense that they only have one power- but they have mastered it to a point of expanding it far beyond its normal uses
05-01-2018T02:49:39,MidnightBlue78,Damn it
05-01-2018T02:49:40,Bgrmystr2,super fail :P
05-01-2018T02:49:51,DarthRexKing,"Whoever the troll is, I hope they die. Later."
05-01-2018T02:49:51,MidnightBlue78,I tried
05-01-2018T02:49:51,Bgrmystr2,Rex is clearly very tired.
05-01-2018T02:50:02,TheBeckoner,Or actually crazy
05-01-2018T02:50:04,DarthRexKing,"Duh, cause I am going to bed Later."
05-01-2018T02:50:06,TheBeckoner,either is good
05-01-2018T02:50:15,MidnightBlue78,:ctwokinds-katx_x:
05-01-2018T02:50:17,SageSaga,which is probably my favorite kinda super hero- they have one power- but they learn to use it in vastly different ways
05-01-2018T02:50:29,Ordithus,Like Batman.  He has money.
05-01-2018T02:50:49,SageSaga,. . . yes... like batman
05-01-2018T02:50:53,Ordithus,lol
05-01-2018T02:51:48,Twokinds,Like Superman
05-01-2018T02:52:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,like Trunks
05-01-2018T02:52:32,SageSaga,actually trunks isnt the worse example-
05-01-2018T02:52:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,really?
05-01-2018T02:52:48,SageSaga,but all the DBZ fighters kinda generally run in the same vein
05-01-2018T02:52:56,SageSaga,they all use Ki as their weapon
05-01-2018T02:53:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,true
05-01-2018T02:53:15,SageSaga,so its like their one power- that they find different and unique ways of using
05-01-2018T02:53:57,TheBeckoner,My powers are procrastination and finishing last minute. They go hand and hand.
05-01-2018T02:54:03,Bgrmystr2,slowly insert just about anyone from the Touhou Project here. They apply to that too. :P
05-01-2018T02:54:09,SageSaga,Goku just copies everyone else - that's his power other than just being a fighting savant
05-01-2018T02:54:13,MidnightBlue78,I do that too Beck
05-01-2018T02:54:14,Ordithus,or any magic user for that matter
05-01-2018T02:54:26,SageSaga,well magic can be broken up into elements
05-01-2018T02:54:27,TheBeckoner,Its a blessing and a curse midnight
05-01-2018T02:54:40,TheBeckoner,"Lotsa of spare time, but lots of stress"
05-01-2018T02:54:40,MidnightBlue78,"yes,I agree"
05-01-2018T02:54:46,SageSaga,so like a fire user using his fire to burn up projectiles and things kinda works in the same concept
05-01-2018T02:54:47,Serpentfrog,Because magic is a consistent system.
05-01-2018T02:54:53,NovaPumnox,Oh boy I do know of this thing we speak of
05-01-2018T02:55:01,NovaPumnox,(what's this about? heh)
05-01-2018T02:55:28,Serpentfrog,"Protip: if you cant contribute, don't speak."
05-01-2018T02:55:36,SageSaga,rude
05-01-2018T02:55:51,Serpentfrog,Accurate.
05-01-2018T02:55:52,TheBeckoner,Well
05-01-2018T02:55:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Then
05-01-2018T02:56:03,TheBeckoner,ayyeeeeee
05-01-2018T02:56:08,SageSaga,There is a rule against being rude
05-01-2018T02:56:15,Serpentfrog,"Ban me, daddy."
05-01-2018T02:56:21,TheBeckoner,ooohhhhh
05-01-2018T02:56:23,SageSaga,ok
05-01-2018T02:56:24,Mihari,Kay!
05-01-2018T02:56:34,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
05-01-2018T02:56:34,TheBeckoner,were's that emote?
05-01-2018T02:56:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
05-01-2018T02:56:39,TheBeckoner,Oh man
05-01-2018T02:56:44,MidnightBlue78,:ctwokinds-keifacepalm:
05-01-2018T02:56:45,Zapheth,lmao
05-01-2018T02:56:57,TheBeckoner,Wow is he gone forever now?
05-01-2018T02:57:05,Bgrmystr2,"technically, yes."
05-01-2018T02:57:08,MidnightBlue78,ayayay Serp
05-01-2018T02:57:09,Bgrmystr2,All bans are perm
05-01-2018T02:57:12,TheBeckoner,Well
05-01-2018T02:57:14,Bgrmystr2,far as I know
05-01-2018T02:57:17,SageSaga,so long as i can remember to unban him when we end
05-01-2018T02:57:24,Bgrmystr2,"but yeah, sage can just do that ^"
05-01-2018T02:57:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'll remind ya
05-01-2018T02:57:33,TheBeckoner,Lol we'll remember
05-01-2018T02:57:34,MidnightBlue78,"ok, so...where were we?"
05-01-2018T02:57:34,SageSaga,ok ty
05-01-2018T02:57:45,Ordithus,superpowers.
05-01-2018T02:57:50,NovaPumnox,"I was joking by the way, sorry xP"
05-01-2018T02:58:07,Mihari,I admit it was fun playing a character ignorant of her own power for 95% of a game :3
05-01-2018T02:58:07,SageSaga,so like if a guy only has fire magic- and he uses that to do things like heal people by burning a virus or disease from a body with a controlled fever-
05-01-2018T02:58:22,SageSaga,that kinda stuff is awesome and shows a crazy level of understanding their power
05-01-2018T02:58:47,Ordithus,That would be an impresive use of fire magic
05-01-2018T02:58:56,SageSaga,when Dove first started out she thought she just had super strength- and could fly-
05-01-2018T02:59:10,MidnightBlue78,"Ooh,look at her wings"
05-01-2018T02:59:24,SageSaga,turns out she was telekinetic to the point that she was unknowingly stopping her own cells from breaking down- ever
05-01-2018T02:59:45,Ordithus,Fancy
05-01-2018T02:59:51,SageSaga,making her effectively ageless
05-01-2018T03:00:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Wolverine
05-01-2018T03:00:22,MidnightBlue78,that's pretty sweet
05-01-2018T03:00:28,SageSaga,wolverine still ages
05-01-2018T03:00:38,Mihari,And Dove doesn't regenerate XD
05-01-2018T03:00:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,well darn
05-01-2018T03:00:52,SageSaga,none of her cells can break down at all and thus dont need to regen- also means she cant age at all
05-01-2018T03:01:06,Mihari,Can still be killed tho.
05-01-2018T03:01:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,rip
05-01-2018T03:01:39,Mihari,"Altho, if she stayed on Earth, the likelihood of that happening are pretty nill."
05-01-2018T03:01:46,Mihari,Even the sun going nova wouldn't kill her.
05-01-2018T03:01:52,SageSaga,yeah because if she stops being conscious to a point that power holding her together will eventually fade and she will start to die
05-01-2018T03:02:22,Ordithus,suuuuper power
05-01-2018T03:02:33,SageSaga,everyone in the game is that level of power though
05-01-2018T03:02:39,Mihari,"Actually no, the sun going nova might kill her"
05-01-2018T03:02:42,NovaPumnox,I like this
05-01-2018T03:02:43,Mihari,The force could do it
05-01-2018T03:02:44,Ordithus,I see what you mean about taking a single power to the extreme
05-01-2018T03:02:46,Mihari,I think
05-01-2018T03:02:56,SageSaga,yeah the impact force could kill her
05-01-2018T03:03:03,Mihari,Shakes it off XD
05-01-2018T03:03:04,SageSaga,but the heat and radiation oddly enough wouldnt
05-01-2018T03:03:38,Mihari,Could outrun the explosion tho
05-01-2018T03:03:40,SageSaga,Tom's character is also effectively immortal- his copies can become the real him if the real him dies
05-01-2018T03:04:27,Ordithus,Do his copies know they are copies and not the original?
05-01-2018T03:04:49,Bgrmystr2,perhaps it's like a hive mind?
05-01-2018T03:04:52,Ordithus,"Like is it a continous stream of conciousness, that just splits"
05-01-2018T03:06:10,NovaPumnox,Why did that one guy get banned? I didn't see the chat in time
05-01-2018T03:06:21,Bgrmystr2,Because he asked for it. Literally.
05-01-2018T03:06:21,Twokinds,"My assumption is that when Bob becomes two Bobs, he's just splitting into two piles of liquid, and it's all part of the same Bob conciousness."
05-01-2018T03:06:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,memes
05-01-2018T03:06:29,Ordithus,I see
05-01-2018T03:06:30,NovaPumnox,Oof
05-01-2018T03:06:38,Twokinds,All is Bob.
05-01-2018T03:06:38,NovaPumnox,Asking for it is odd
05-01-2018T03:06:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,eww Bob juice
05-01-2018T03:06:57,Ordithus,So would Bob care if we fry up some Bob?  I want calamari.
05-01-2018T03:07:06,w0lfmare,"Bob is many, Bob is one"
05-01-2018T03:07:16,NovaPumnox,Bob is number one
05-01-2018T03:07:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,""" we are bob, and we are many"""
05-01-2018T03:07:30,MidnightBlue78,what game is this again??
05-01-2018T03:07:33,w0lfmare,This is a D&D game?
05-01-2018T03:07:36,Keilani5747,Open bob?
05-01-2018T03:08:20,Bgrmystr2,"So it's literally a collective consciousness. The copies are not copies per~se, but just more of the original, split."
05-01-2018T03:08:26,NovaPumnox,"We all have a little bit of bob in us, nobody knows it yet"
05-01-2018T03:08:33,SageSaga,this is a Pen and Paper RPG like DnD
05-01-2018T03:08:37,Bgrmystr2,"That is probably true, Nova."
05-01-2018T03:08:38,SageSaga,but it is not DnD
05-01-2018T03:08:54,SageSaga,we use Savage Worlds Super Heroes mixed with Savage World Sci-fi
05-01-2018T03:09:01,SageSaga,so its like Star Trek Super Heroes
05-01-2018T03:09:16,w0lfmare,It's awfully in-depth
05-01-2018T03:09:24,NovaPumnox,"Wait bgr, so like a sort of split-into-two kinda thing with the same mindset and everything?"
05-01-2018T03:09:25,Mihari,A lot more of it feels like Stargate Super Heros XD
05-01-2018T03:09:31,Mihari,With a dab of trek XD
05-01-2018T03:09:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,My hero academia in space
05-01-2018T03:09:44,NovaPumnox,Kind of like how the game SOMA works?
05-01-2018T03:10:01,SageSaga,Stargate because of the humor?
05-01-2018T03:10:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Stargate is awesome
05-01-2018T03:10:25,Mihari,The ship and teleporting mostly
05-01-2018T03:10:41,SageSaga,well its not teleporting all the time
05-01-2018T03:10:53,SageSaga,you usually stick to the FTL drive
05-01-2018T03:10:54,Mihari,Did you ever watch universe?
05-01-2018T03:10:57,SageSaga,yep
05-01-2018T03:11:04,Mihari,"Most people hated it, but I really liked it."
05-01-2018T03:11:08,SageSaga,i enjoyed it
05-01-2018T03:11:11,SageSaga,wish it lasted
05-01-2018T03:11:14,Mihari,Same.
05-01-2018T03:11:20,w0lfmare,How long have you been playing pen and paper RPGs Sage?
05-01-2018T03:11:32,SageSaga,how long has air been around?
05-01-2018T03:11:47,w0lfmare,No idea
05-01-2018T03:11:48,Ordithus,On Earth?
05-01-2018T03:11:51,SageSaga,sometime after that
05-01-2018T03:12:07,SageSaga,jeez- i guess 23 years now?
05-01-2018T03:12:08,w0lfmare,:cw0lfmare-EmberHide:
05-01-2018T03:12:11,Mihari,It did go away for a while XD
05-01-2018T03:12:13,Mihari,Air that is
05-01-2018T03:12:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Aww emby
05-01-2018T03:12:54,w0lfmare,"Wow, that is some time"
05-01-2018T03:14:10,NovaPumnox,I don't know why but this reminds me when years ago I used to create stick figure comics
05-01-2018T03:14:13,Bgrmystr2,"Lol, Nova, Imagine if Water itself had consciousness. You can split it and stuff, and there's water in both places, but it's still water. and that's just basically how it would work with tom's character. Except it's not water, it's Bob."
05-01-2018T03:14:28,SageSaga,i played a bit of 2nd edition with some older friends but reeeeally got into it myself in 2000
05-01-2018T03:14:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,@Bgrmystr2 serp says that asexual reproduction
05-01-2018T03:14:52,Keilani5747,Serp is correct
05-01-2018T03:15:01,Bgrmystr2,that would require more than one consciousness.
05-01-2018T03:15:04,Bgrmystr2,there isn't.
05-01-2018T03:15:07,NovaPumnox,I'm having to read over this several times to think about it
05-01-2018T03:15:08,Bgrmystr2,so it wouldn't be.
05-01-2018T03:15:16,Keilani5747,Time for Bio 101
05-01-2018T03:15:18,NovaPumnox,"OH, I see"
05-01-2018T03:15:24,NovaPumnox,What if
05-01-2018T03:15:32,NovaPumnox,Since we're all made up mostly of water
05-01-2018T03:15:36,NovaPumnox,We're all bob?
05-01-2018T03:15:44,Bgrmystr2,...yes.
05-01-2018T03:15:46,w0lfmare,I've had... 12 failed campaigns
05-01-2018T03:15:47,Bgrmystr2,we're all bob.
05-01-2018T03:15:47,SageSaga,man Ebonwell in Silver Age Sentinels was soooooo OP
05-01-2018T03:15:50,Ordithus,One happy bob family
05-01-2018T03:15:54,SageSaga,he could teleport planets
05-01-2018T03:16:09,NovaPumnox,One big Bob family
05-01-2018T03:16:19,Mihari,If I maxed out my TK I could throw planets XD
05-01-2018T03:16:48,Ordithus,Galactic scale billiards
05-01-2018T03:17:01,NovaPumnox,That would be quite a sight
05-01-2018T03:17:02,Mihari,Had to spread out the bonus for other fun stuff tho
05-01-2018T03:17:02,w0lfmare,But I feel like I've said that before
05-01-2018T03:17:05,Mihari,Flight is expensive T_T
05-01-2018T03:17:11,SageSaga,in his history he saved the earth from a meteor by sending  the earth into his pocket dimension where it stayed in darkness for a a few minutes while the meteor passed through
05-01-2018T03:17:51,SageSaga,"""Why didnt you just send the meteor away?"" ""Uhm- I wasnt on the meteor- i was on the earth- jeez"""
05-01-2018T03:17:58,Twokinds,That's why Bob is a very slow blob
05-01-2018T03:18:23,Mihari,"Yah, but steel some of flight and you can go mach 23 :P"
05-01-2018T03:18:28,TheBeckoner,lol
05-01-2018T03:18:29,NovaPumnox,What if the entire earth just started with Bob and all of this work and creation is his doing?
05-01-2018T03:18:32,SageSaga,"though i think one of my favorite ""Heroes"" was Rune"
05-01-2018T03:18:39,NovaPumnox,Tom is the spawn of bob
05-01-2018T03:18:40,SageSaga,i think i drew a picture of Rune-
05-01-2018T03:18:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,so Bob is gimli
05-01-2018T03:18:55,Mihari,"Oh yah, that's important, Tom can copy any power."
05-01-2018T03:19:02,MidnightBlue78,Bob splits like an ameoba
05-01-2018T03:19:26,w0lfmare,The copy any power power is OP
05-01-2018T03:19:28,TheBeckoner,Copy it forever?
05-01-2018T03:19:33,Mihari,"If he wanted too, yes."
05-01-2018T03:19:34,NovaPumnox,"I'm just gonna refer to all cells from now on as ""bob cells"""
05-01-2018T03:19:38,TheBeckoner,hmm
05-01-2018T03:19:54,SageSaga,Rune was an old detective that while on a stake out his partner turned out to be crooked and almost got him killed in a dock side warehouse filled with stolen artifacts
05-01-2018T03:19:58,NovaPumnox,That'll confuse people but little do they know it's the great discovery
05-01-2018T03:20:07,TheBeckoner,Can he only copy one at a time?
05-01-2018T03:20:15,Mihari,No.
05-01-2018T03:20:16,TheBeckoner,Sorry I wasnt here for this whole thing
05-01-2018T03:20:26,TheBeckoner,Wow that seem op lol
05-01-2018T03:20:30,TheBeckoner,seems*
05-01-2018T03:20:34,Twokinds,I can only copy a certain amount
05-01-2018T03:20:34,Mihari,"He can copy a lot small powers, think of it as this, he has a pool of points for his copy power"
05-01-2018T03:20:36,SageSaga,he got thrown into a crate that broke and managed to get his hands on an old dagger that he hid and stabbed into his partner
05-01-2018T03:20:50,TheBeckoner,Makes sense
05-01-2018T03:20:52,Twokinds,"I could copy one big power, or lots of little powers, and anywhere inbetween."
05-01-2018T03:21:01,Mihari,As long as he has points for the power he's copying he can copy it.
05-01-2018T03:21:03,SageSaga,"the dagger then said ""I accept this sacrifice"" and possessed the detective-"
05-01-2018T03:21:03,TheBeckoner,And give it a limiting factor
05-01-2018T03:21:06,Mihari,Each power has it's own value
05-01-2018T03:21:07,TheBeckoner,gives*
05-01-2018T03:21:17,NovaPumnox,Can you copy the power to copy a power?
05-01-2018T03:21:28,Mihari,Yess.... but that would be kinda silly
05-01-2018T03:21:29,unsteddyphoenix,Oh still going? impressive
05-01-2018T03:21:35,Ordithus,"How many Bobs are there, presently?"
05-01-2018T03:21:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,wb Unsteddy
05-01-2018T03:21:40,SageSaga,then Rune got one of the creepiest powers- he could shoot daggers out of his eye
05-01-2018T03:21:43,TheBeckoner,Like how fo4 give you 22 level point at the start or something like that
05-01-2018T03:21:47,Ordithus,"ew, sage"
05-01-2018T03:21:49,NovaPumnox,I like silly
05-01-2018T03:21:59,Mihari,"Okay, stop right there Sage."
05-01-2018T03:22:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Unsteddy guess what
05-01-2018T03:22:04,Mihari,Ewww T_T
05-01-2018T03:22:08,TheBeckoner,Sounds groos
05-01-2018T03:22:11,TheBeckoner,and painful
05-01-2018T03:22:15,SageSaga,they werent real but they looked real- and tore sanity away from their targets
05-01-2018T03:22:21,Ordithus,that it would
05-01-2018T03:22:26,SageSaga,driving them mad
05-01-2018T03:22:30,Ordithus,It's working right now
05-01-2018T03:22:36,TheBeckoner,Oh ok
05-01-2018T03:22:43,NovaPumnox,Wait so the daggers phase out of the eye and into the target?
05-01-2018T03:22:59,SageSaga,the first combat he was in was with this massive mutant with like wing arms and shot sonic waves that smashed cars-
05-01-2018T03:23:10,SageSaga,Rune one shot him and turned him into a blathering idiot
05-01-2018T03:23:20,unsteddyphoenix,whats sup
05-01-2018T03:23:29,TheBeckoner,Hullo unsteddy
05-01-2018T03:23:34,SageSaga,we never got his name so we called him Meat Flaps Mgee
05-01-2018T03:23:40,TheBeckoner,lol
05-01-2018T03:23:45,NovaPumnox,Heh

05-01-2018T03:24:19,Bgrmystr2,At least get his name!
05-01-2018T03:24:32,SageSaga,eventually the demonic blade tried to take over though-
05-01-2018T03:24:36,MidnightBlue78,I'd rather have no name at all
05-01-2018T03:24:54,unsteddyphoenix,this conversation is confusing
05-01-2018T03:24:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Sage don't forget about serp
05-01-2018T03:25:13,Bgrmystr2,prolly not time yet anyway
05-01-2018T03:25:22,SageSaga,and with the help of another wizard like hero he expelled it and replaced the now missing eye with an artifact or planar binding
05-01-2018T03:25:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,he know the way
05-01-2018T03:25:32,Zapheth,bruddah

05-01-2018T15:14:48,sunblaze,TF-ray in pistolform
05-01-2018T15:14:54,sunblaze,and that was for sage :D
05-01-2018T15:14:58,sunblaze,still a good idea
05-01-2018T15:17:46,Mir117,Do you use slash t for tagging?
05-01-2018T15:18:27,SageSaga,you use /w for whisper and @username for tagging
05-01-2018T15:18:40,SageSaga,like #Mir117
05-01-2018T15:18:42,SageSaga,bah
05-01-2018T15:18:51,SageSaga,@Mir117 there?
05-01-2018T15:19:20,Mir117,Ah
05-01-2018T15:19:24,Mir117,Thank you!
05-01-2018T15:19:27,SageSaga,np
05-01-2018T15:19:54,TheBeckoner,and /me to looks cool
05-01-2018T15:19:57,SageSaga,neither are as good as they used to be though- and streamers can turn whispers to themselves off
05-01-2018T15:20:00,TheBeckoner,looks cool
05-01-2018T15:20:19,TheBeckoner,Tom has his whisper thing off
05-01-2018T15:20:42,Mir117,"Will we get more about the ingame lore later, i.e. kingdoms, races, wars, pre and post adventurer cataclysm?"
05-01-2018T15:21:04,SageSaga,absolutely
05-01-2018T15:21:26,Mir117,Hooray!
05-01-2018T15:22:14,TheBeckoner,Are we gonna get to hear the story about the wizards in the candy shop uncle Sage?
05-01-2018T15:22:36,SageSaga,i can probably tell that when i take a break
05-01-2018T15:22:43,TheBeckoner,Coolio
05-01-2018T15:23:01,SageSaga,night now though i gotta get my food cooking and take my medicine
05-01-2018T15:23:04,SageSaga,brb
05-01-2018T15:23:08,TheBeckoner,Seeya
05-01-2018T15:23:50,Mir117,Was there a name for the cataclysm? I think Relm may have mentioned it.
05-01-2018T15:30:53,SageSaga,it wasnt really a cataclysm
05-01-2018T15:31:28,SageSaga,well i guess it could be defined as a massive upheaval so- maybe
05-01-2018T15:31:37,SageSaga,but no it doesnt have a given name
05-01-2018T15:33:25,w0lfmare,The weirdening
05-01-2018T15:33:29,w0lfmare,:cw0lfmare-HeadEmber:
05-01-2018T15:33:37,SageSaga,nooope
05-01-2018T15:33:46,TheBeckoner,Hullo W0lf
05-01-2018T15:33:55,w0lfmare,Hello
05-01-2018T15:34:01,SageSaga,that name was a joke
05-01-2018T15:34:33,SageSaga,by a news woman and everyone latched on to it and shes hated it since
05-01-2018T15:34:47,Mir117,Hi wolf!
05-01-2018T15:36:08,SageSaga,"when discussing the name for it with my co-writer way back he suggested that- i laughed and said it was terrible- and he was like ""Yeah- lets do it anyways and come up with a reason its terrible"""
05-01-2018T15:38:02,Mir117,"Wait...that is not actually the name though, right?"
05-01-2018T15:38:08,Mir117,Or is it...
05-01-2018T15:38:26,w0lfmare,We're talking about Yosh(!)
05-01-2018T15:38:42,Mir117,I am very off target
05-01-2018T15:39:16,Mir117,"I haven't read yosh, I found out about Sage via the AI art that Tom did."
05-01-2018T15:39:21,SageSaga,yeah that was from Yosh - the event in AI is unnamed because historians dont really exist as much- Relm's father and his friends being one of the exceptions
05-01-2018T15:39:44,TheBeckoner,"This may be dumb but what is ""Al"""
05-01-2018T15:39:56,TheBeckoner,Sorry if its readily apparent
05-01-2018T15:40:22,BadFoMo,Sage's other comic. ...I think.
05-01-2018T15:40:23,SageSaga,its the comic im working on right now
05-01-2018T15:40:28,w0lfmare,"""The night all the adventurers disappeared for some reason"""
05-01-2018T15:40:36,TheBeckoner,Oh ok.
05-01-2018T15:40:36,SageSaga,Artificial Incident
05-01-2018T15:40:56,TheBeckoner,"That's right, I remember seeing that name here and there..."
05-01-2018T15:41:52,BadFoMo,Cabose: What's the 'A' stand for again?
05-01-2018T15:42:13,SageSaga,in a world where learning can turn you into a wizard - why would you choose to be a historian?
05-01-2018T15:42:32,w0lfmare,Good point
05-01-2018T15:42:42,w0lfmare,But why not both?
05-01-2018T15:43:20,SageSaga,Wizarding is hard work
05-01-2018T15:44:10,CrRAR,bu... but the historians. :&lt;
05-01-2018T15:44:18,sunblaze,magic &gt; history :D
05-01-2018T15:44:21,sunblaze,that is a fact :D
05-01-2018T15:44:51,CrRAR,I accept this superior reality.
05-01-2018T15:45:32,SageSaga,there are historians and even wizard historians but they arent a united group like Relm's father has kinda put together
05-01-2018T15:46:01,SageSaga,hes basically built up a funding from nobles and a group of researchers and scribes
05-01-2018T15:53:52,SageSaga,"also other Nations like their secrets- Secret Mage groups, secret cults, secret shadow governments, secretly monster dominated human kingdoms- the usual stuff"
05-01-2018T15:54:56,CrRAR,haha
05-01-2018T15:56:08,TheBeckoner,Secrats r fun
05-01-2018T15:56:57,w0lfmare,Secrets are bad
05-01-2018T15:57:13,SageSaga,"""Monsters? Ha! We havent had problems with monsters in over 150 years! We do have a number of people vanish mysteriously though... But no worries!"""
05-01-2018T15:57:17,w0lfmare,They're the story's main protagonist
05-01-2018T15:58:07,SageSaga,brb foodz-
05-01-2018T15:58:15,CrRAR,"k, enjoy~"
05-01-2018T15:58:17,SageSaga,oh and if anyone hasnt read it yet-
05-01-2018T15:58:35,SageSaga,http://ai.katbox.net/
05-01-2018T16:02:49,TheBeckoner,Welp that webpage is not working at all for me for some reason. It loaded but nothing happens when I click lol
05-01-2018T16:02:54,TheBeckoner,Mah stupid internet
05-01-2018T16:03:36,TheBeckoner,Oh
05-01-2018T16:03:38,TheBeckoner,there we go
05-01-2018T16:03:40,TheBeckoner,it work
05-01-2018T16:05:55,Mir117,My nets wiggin out too
05-01-2018T16:06:00,Mir117,Haven't a clue why
05-01-2018T16:07:48,Mir117,Is anyone else worried about Kevin's body?
05-01-2018T16:08:03,SageSaga,hahaha
05-01-2018T16:08:08,Mir117,Going days stuck in a machine without lifesupport is no good
05-01-2018T16:08:16,TheBeckoner,What's a kevin?
05-01-2018T16:08:25,Mir117,I'm thinking shrivlier then Mr.House.
05-01-2018T16:09:24,w0lfmare,"Well if he's the only person in the game, there must be a real-world reason"
05-01-2018T16:09:29,SageSaga,next chapter will actually hit on something big that will impact Kevin
05-01-2018T16:11:28,SageSaga,And much later there is an update on whats going on in the real world- and its pretty massive
05-01-2018T16:13:45,Mir117,"I still curious about the psychological connection. Is Kaylin Kevin, kinda? Is she really independent now? Did Kevin just dooze off and this all time it's just a dream?"
05-01-2018T16:14:13,SageSaga,unlike most of these stories
05-01-2018T16:14:28,SageSaga,i actually intend to answer all those questions
05-01-2018T16:15:05,TheBeckoner,I'm gonna go do some stuff. See y'all later ^-^
05-01-2018T16:15:26,Mir117,Cya!
05-01-2018T16:15:32,SageSaga,take care
05-01-2018T16:15:54,CrRAR,bye beck
05-01-2018T16:17:11,SageSaga,"so many of these stories focus just on the world they are in and not the world they came from - its like, if you wanted to make a story JUST about this other world why not do a regular fantasy story?"
05-01-2018T16:19:56,SageSaga,its a total waste of a setting
05-01-2018T16:22:09,SageSaga,i gotta work on writing more of the Twokinds side story too
05-01-2018T16:23:06,BadFoMo,TwoKinds Side story?
05-01-2018T16:23:33,SageSaga,yeah im going to be writing a Twokinds comic series for Tom
05-01-2018T16:23:48,BadFoMo,Coll.
05-01-2018T16:23:53,BadFoMo,*Cool
05-01-2018T16:23:56,FoxxTrotter,:0)
05-01-2018T16:23:58,BadFoMo,*.
05-01-2018T16:24:36,BadFoMo,Is it too soon to say what it's about?
05-01-2018T16:25:54,CrRAR,It was discussed a little last night I think.
05-01-2018T16:25:58,CrRAR,Hijinx of whoever's left at Trace's manor rn.
05-01-2018T16:27:09,SageSaga,"i think all i can really say is what Tom already said publicly - which pretty much that- and the character focus is Madelyn, Kat, Evals and Mike"
05-01-2018T16:28:28,BadFoMo,"Oh, I guess I slept through that."
05-01-2018T16:29:10,CrRAR,Shenanigans abound~
05-01-2018T16:29:56,SageSaga,brb
05-01-2018T16:30:08,CrRAR,ok
05-01-2018T16:33:22,SageSaga,back

05-01-2018T17:20:10,SageSaga,just working on the comic while thinking of something i gotta write later
05-01-2018T17:20:42,BluePhantom90,Hey Foxx. and what you got to write later about?
05-01-2018T17:21:30,SageSaga,a script
05-01-2018T17:29:46,BluePhantom90,for your comic?
05-01-2018T17:30:13,SageSaga,not my comic
05-01-2018T17:31:02,SageSaga,all my scripts for AI are written out for the next 20 pages
05-01-2018T17:31:42,TheBeckoner,For a Tom's side story Blue
05-01-2018T17:32:53,SageSaga,i love this song

05-01-2018T17:34:31,ZahnHolley,"How are ya sage?"""
05-01-2018T17:35:28,SageSaga,alright
05-01-2018T17:39:04,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-sleepy: mornin
05-01-2018T17:39:14,Bgrmystr2,how you guys doin
05-01-2018T17:39:39,FoxxTrotter,"Hey, Bgr."
05-01-2018T17:40:01,Bgrmystr2,Nero not streaming anymore?
05-01-2018T17:41:13,TheBeckoner,Hey Bgr
05-01-2018T17:41:21,Twokinds,Jeez
05-01-2018T17:41:36,Twokinds,I was gunna stream today but it's already almost 6pm and I feel like I just woke up.
05-01-2018T17:42:59,Bgrmystr2,I know that feel
05-01-2018T17:43:01,TheBeckoner,I woke up at 2pm lol I feel the same
05-01-2018T17:43:04,Bgrmystr2,I literally did just wake up
05-01-2018T17:43:09,Bgrmystr2,so good morning. :D
05-01-2018T17:43:19,TheBeckoner,Lol good morning?
05-01-2018T17:43:25,TheBeckoner,its almost 5 here
05-01-2018T17:43:27,Bgrmystr2,Yes. Morning
05-01-2018T17:43:30,Bgrmystr2,4:44pm.
05-01-2018T17:43:34,TheBeckoner,Yup
05-01-2018T17:43:35,Bgrmystr2,Morning is when I wake up.
05-01-2018T17:43:41,TheBeckoner,^ correct
05-01-2018T17:43:46,Bgrmystr2,Good.
05-01-2018T17:43:48,BadFoMo,I have 5:43 PM.
05-01-2018T17:44:28,TheBeckoner,And the next day doesnt happen until I go to bed and wake up :wink:\
05-01-2018T17:44:49,Bgrmystr2,remember that doesn't apply to day names :P
05-01-2018T17:44:57,Bgrmystr2,otherwise you'll miss days of the week
05-01-2018T17:45:07,TheBeckoner,well yes
05-01-2018T17:54:15,SageSaga,hmmm odd question - not sure if anyone here can answer it-
05-01-2018T17:54:26,Bgrmystr2,go for it?
05-01-2018T17:55:12,SageSaga,if you have a restraining order against ya and you go to a fast food place and the person who put the restraining order against you now works there- do you have to avoid that location? Are you in violation for using that place of business?
05-01-2018T17:55:46,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: uh..
05-01-2018T17:56:30,w0lfmare,I think the same applies to running into that person anywhere
05-01-2018T17:56:31,Bgrmystr2,"I think legally you have to avoid that one specific place of business, but I'm not 100% sure on that. It highly depends on the place, people, and scenario"
05-01-2018T17:57:42,SageSaga,because lets say this guy gets assaulted by a group of people- like a whole family- he puts a restraining order on the entire family- then gets a job at a local restaurant- i feel like the loss of such a large number of customers due to a legal
05-01-2018T17:58:01,SageSaga,restriction would make that person unemployable in a small community
05-01-2018T17:58:42,w0lfmare,I'm sure there's some customization to it
05-01-2018T17:59:10,Bgrmystr2,"My mother had a restraining order against her ex due to the damage to house property a bout a decade ago. He couldn't go to the house without a police escort, and I believe it was the same story if she were to go to his place of work."
05-01-2018T17:59:27,w0lfmare,"Like, maybe the person assaulted is okay with them eating at the restaurant he works at, as long as he's working the back room"
05-01-2018T18:00:33,SageSaga,"i think there was a rule about how a restrained person cant approach but the one who is protected by the order can approach them- it doesnt mean they have to move away- lol like some kinda ""Your forcing me to break the law or jump into traffic!"" XD"
05-01-2018T18:00:51,CrRAR,The thing is if the situation was serious enough to warrant a restraining order you wouldn't want that person at your place of employment.
05-01-2018T18:01:18,CrRAR,Regardless of lost business.
05-01-2018T18:01:21,Bgrmystr2,"I don't think any place of business will lose that much money losing a few customers. even 5-10 people is a LOT to have a restraining order for, but yeah, I don't actually think that person wouldn't be able to get a job."
05-01-2018T18:01:24,w0lfmare,Or outside jail
05-01-2018T18:01:58,CrRAR,"Yeah like bgr alluded to, restraining orders aren't given out willy-nilly."
05-01-2018T18:02:04,SageSaga,in a small town a family of 10-20 people can cause a restaurant to go under
05-01-2018T18:02:34,Twokinds,It probably varies from state to state and the specific order in question
05-01-2018T18:02:47,CrRAR,As the business owner I just would not want the possibly of potential bad blood.
05-01-2018T18:02:50,Twokinds,But here is an anicdote I found while googling:
05-01-2018T18:02:51,Bgrmystr2,"businesses have hundreds to thousands of customers. losing 5-10 is a drop in the bucket, and that's only if the order is to that degree. But I only know what's here in Louisiana"
05-01-2018T18:02:55,Twokinds,"""unless it can be proven person A is specifically trying to harass person B, then person B must leave. My ex wife filed one on me. If I am within 500' of her for any reason, even if she comes to somewhere I am already, I must leave"""
05-01-2018T18:03:08,CrRAR,"Sadly, the solution would be to find a way to terminate the employee if it was an issue."
05-01-2018T18:03:32,CrRAR,If it meant impacting business to that level.
05-01-2018T18:03:41,CrRAR,interesting
05-01-2018T18:03:43,Bgrmystr2,yeah Cr
05-01-2018T18:03:54,SageSaga,"i feel like the ""I must leave if the other person comes in"" is really bad because imagine this-"
05-01-2018T18:04:01,BluePhantom90,that is messed up
05-01-2018T18:04:05,SageSaga,you are in line with all your groceries when your Ex walks in
05-01-2018T18:04:08,BluePhantom90,wait Tom you were married?
05-01-2018T18:04:15,CrRAR,it's a quote XD
05-01-2018T18:04:21,CrRAR,"""from google"""
05-01-2018T18:04:36,SageSaga,"and you just go ""Well crap- i gotta leave all this food here now! Thanks a lot Margret! This is why I hit you!"""
05-01-2018T18:04:41,w0lfmare,Blue XD
05-01-2018T18:05:02,Bgrmystr2,Take it blue didn't read all of tom's messages
05-01-2018T18:05:14,BluePhantom90,I was away yes.
05-01-2018T18:05:19,BluePhantom90,Doing Army things
05-01-2018T18:05:21,Bgrmystr2,scroll up :P
05-01-2018T18:05:30,BluePhantom90,Sleeping on a damn cot again
05-01-2018T18:05:34,Twokinds,"The law seems to be in most places that you must leave ""as soon as possible"""
05-01-2018T18:05:53,CrRAR,"Yeah, it depends who raises the issue Sage they could pass each other at the supermarket but as long as neither instigate and go on their merry way there's no problem"
05-01-2018T18:05:57,BluePhantom90,heres my set up https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/359539176817033226/399336423016366080/20180106_175854.jpg
05-01-2018T18:06:12,Twokinds,"So you would still be able to pay for the groceries. Though yeah, the whole situation sounds like a mess of legal objectivity."
05-01-2018T18:06:28,Bgrmystr2,"Also, restraining orders are there for a reason. But I don't think MOST people would raise a fuss at a grocery store. There's too many witnesses."
05-01-2018T18:06:50,Bgrmystr2,"Same thing with a fast food place, or whatnot"
05-01-2018T18:06:51,BluePhantom90,Daw sage You deleted a pic of my set up.
05-01-2018T18:06:56,SageSaga,Ha Margret! This time the law is on my side! I will get this candy too!
05-01-2018T18:07:03,Bgrmystr2,"you didn't ask, blue"
05-01-2018T18:07:06,Bgrmystr2,:P
05-01-2018T18:07:10,SageSaga,yeah we have rules!
05-01-2018T18:07:16,CrRAR,"Yeah, laws don't specify 2 people can't be near each other, the restraining order makes the separation enforceable when/if it becomes an issue by police."
05-01-2018T18:07:18,BluePhantom90,r-r yeah yeah
05-01-2018T18:07:22,CrRAR,lol sage
05-01-2018T18:07:24,w0lfmare,I don't think they'd let it be unreasonable.
05-01-2018T18:07:30,CrRAR,See that's instigating.
05-01-2018T18:07:43,CrRAR,Passive aggressively lol
05-01-2018T18:07:47,Bgrmystr2,xD
05-01-2018T18:07:54,BluePhantom90,Almost reminds me of what happen to my step brother.
05-01-2018T18:07:59,CrRAR,It completely depends on who gets triggered first XD
05-01-2018T18:08:41,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, I don't think most people would make a scene at a public place and draw attention to themselves"
05-01-2018T18:08:55,BluePhantom90,He divorced his wife and after 3 days she calls police saying He sexually touched his adopted daughter (Father was another guys)
05-01-2018T18:08:56,SageSaga,im ironically using Margret because my former Aunt Margret sent my Uncle to jail over false accusations of abuse
05-01-2018T18:09:37,CrRAR,"Yeah see, there's no fixing Margret taking the offensive should she ever see him again."
05-01-2018T18:09:57,CrRAR,Uncle should just stay the heck away...
05-01-2018T18:09:58,BluePhantom90,"Now if he ever wants to see his biological son, the only way to pick him up is having His dad take him and pick up his son."
05-01-2018T18:10:00,CrRAR,far away
05-01-2018T18:10:02,CrRAR,XD
05-01-2018T18:10:05,TheBeckoner,"""This is why I hit you"" Lol Sage"
05-01-2018T18:10:07,SageSaga,get this- she said he threw a lamp at her- but she caught it and threw it back at him in self defense
05-01-2018T18:10:20,CrRAR,What!?
05-01-2018T18:10:22,SageSaga,thats why it was broken on his head where he was and not where she was
05-01-2018T18:10:26,CrRAR,Talk about reflexes
05-01-2018T18:10:27,TheBeckoner,So aggressive catch?
05-01-2018T18:10:44,w0lfmare,lol
05-01-2018T18:10:47,SageSaga,and she couldnt catch a Frisbee
05-01-2018T18:10:53,CrRAR,*bonk*
05-01-2018T18:11:41,TheBeckoner,gang?
05-01-2018T18:11:50,SageSaga,"she had no injuries - yet my uncle had a black eye, a bruised head and cuts from broken glass in his head as well as bruising around his neck from tiny fingers"
05-01-2018T18:12:15,TheBeckoner,"Oh no, not the tiny fingers..."
05-01-2018T18:12:21,TheBeckoner,Yeah she sounds like a charm lol
05-01-2018T18:12:35,CrRAR,"damn, poor guy."
05-01-2018T18:12:41,SageSaga,he said when the lamp hit him he blacked out and when he woke up he has a sore throat and the cops were taking him away
05-01-2018T18:12:57,SageSaga,which says to me she tried to choke him while he was unconcious
05-01-2018T18:13:12,CrRAR,Marriage is a helluva drug~
05-01-2018T18:13:19,SageSaga,unconscious*
05-01-2018T18:13:29,CrRAR,good catch
05-01-2018T18:13:38,SageSaga,even with all that evidence well-
05-01-2018T18:13:51,CrRAR,luckily grampy serp ain't watchin
05-01-2018T18:14:12,SageSaga,he still went to jail for 2 years- got out after 10 months because of good behavior and well- no one at the jail believed he did it -
05-01-2018T18:14:19,SageSaga,because hes a freakn pacifist
05-01-2018T18:14:40,TheBeckoner,Men usually don't fare well in man v woman cases so I'm not entirely surprised.
05-01-2018T18:14:55,CrRAR,Yeah it's really sad how manipulative those Margret types can be.
05-01-2018T18:15:04,Bgrmystr2,So how exactly did she win if she has zero bruises on her and he's the one all beaten up?
05-01-2018T18:15:09,Bgrmystr2,that tells me she's the abusive one.
05-01-2018T18:15:11,CrRAR,Esp if they find a sympathizer in the system :(
05-01-2018T18:15:18,TheBeckoner,Mmm yea
05-01-2018T18:15:24,SageSaga,yeah and we all knew she had a temper
05-01-2018T18:15:49,CrRAR,It's so tough because lots of times the family knows the true story.
05-01-2018T18:15:54,Bgrmystr2,"if she had ANYTHING on her, anything at all, her story may sound better, but all the damage is on the guy tells me she's the one that hit him."
05-01-2018T18:16:04,CrRAR,yeah
05-01-2018T18:16:06,Bgrmystr2,cuz both sides will show signs of a struggle
05-01-2018T18:16:14,Bgrmystr2,but that wasn't the case.
05-01-2018T18:16:17,CrRAR,But I guarantee she put on a GOOD show.
05-01-2018T18:16:18,SageSaga,she claimed pain but there were no physical signs
05-01-2018T18:16:21,CrRAR,^
05-01-2018T18:16:37,SageSaga,she can cry on command i can tell ya that
05-01-2018T18:16:44,TheBeckoner,Ew
05-01-2018T18:16:56,Bgrmystr2,"congratulations, she can fake it. It wouldn't pass with me, honestly"
05-01-2018T18:17:01,CrRAR,"Yeah, the system is poised to protect victims."
05-01-2018T18:17:02,Bgrmystr2,I've seen so many people do that
05-01-2018T18:17:06,TheBeckoner,Is she around still?
05-01-2018T18:17:12,SageSaga,crazy part- some of her family shows up at our family events
05-01-2018T18:17:18,SageSaga,she doesnt
05-01-2018T18:17:31,Bgrmystr2,"I would hope not, she's fucking nutso asshole"
05-01-2018T18:17:32,Bgrmystr2,&gt;;c
05-01-2018T18:17:35,CrRAR,A good story with a good actress will do it.
05-01-2018T18:17:37,CrRAR,Ugh
05-01-2018T18:17:43,SageSaga,my grandmother when she was still alive told her shes not wanted anywhere near our family
05-01-2018T18:17:54,TheBeckoner,Good on her

05-01-2018T18:18:12,CrRAR,She knows the truth~
05-01-2018T18:18:18,Bgrmystr2,Sometimes.. it happens
05-01-2018T18:18:31,SageSaga,but she still welcomes the other members of her family to the events
05-01-2018T18:18:45,SageSaga,well welcomed* she passed away last year
05-01-2018T18:18:56,CrRAR,How altruistic~

05-01-2018T18:19:10,Bgrmystr2,my condolences :C
05-01-2018T18:19:31,Bgrmystr2,sounded like your grandma was a good woman
05-01-2018T18:19:35,SageSaga,i think i was streaming when i got the call that she died
05-01-2018T18:19:37,CrRAR,"Also mine as well, sounded like a fine lady"
05-01-2018T18:19:45,CrRAR,awww

05-01-2018T18:20:21,Bgrmystr2,"I may have been there, I go to a lot of streams."
05-01-2018T18:20:26,SageSaga,we knew she was dying- she had 2 forms of cancer
05-01-2018T18:21:23,TheBeckoner,Always a sad way to go imo...
05-01-2018T18:21:29,TheBeckoner,I wanna die in my sleep
05-01-2018T18:21:34,TheBeckoner,or via explosion
05-01-2018T18:21:37,SageSaga,"""We noticed your treatment wasnt working so we looked into it further and it is working- on one cancer- turns out you have this other cancer too- and its a lot more aggressive and needs a much harsher treatment- tbh the treatment will kill you"""
05-01-2018T18:22:11,Bgrmystr2,:(
05-01-2018T18:22:16,Bgrmystr2,that's really sad
05-01-2018T18:22:16,CrRAR,"My grandma went through almost the same thing, in the end she just wanted to live happily without the stress and pains of too much treatment."
05-01-2018T18:22:38,CrRAR,Doctors often seem to know more than they do.
05-01-2018T18:22:47,CrRAR,Till they don't.
05-01-2018T18:23:37,TheBeckoner,Hence why I wanna explode as death and not die via sickness
05-01-2018T18:23:58,CrRAR,True dat lol
05-01-2018T18:24:05,Bgrmystr2,so you'd rather just go quickly instead of slowly?
05-01-2018T18:24:05,CrRAR,best way.
05-01-2018T18:24:30,CrRAR,Jump into volcano [✓]
05-01-2018T18:24:36,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, that usually would imply you would die sooner than you should have."
05-01-2018T18:24:53,Bgrmystr2,"or, sooner than you would have* anyway"
05-01-2018T18:24:58,SageSaga,im just going to go on believing that i will live forever till i dont

05-01-2018T18:26:33,CrRAR,what is this magical thing?
05-01-2018T18:26:46,CrRAR,Is it an older film?
05-01-2018T18:26:56,SageSaga,Tom Hanks character is told he has a life threatening disease with no cure
05-01-2018T18:26:58,CrRAR,I haven heard of Meg Ryan in anything in forever

05-01-2018T18:27:07,Bgrmystr2,"I don't know most stars by name, so that's not helpful to me :c"
05-01-2018T18:27:10,CrRAR,Sounds pretty solid.
05-01-2018T18:27:44,SageSaga,he is approached by a rich man who offers him a ton of money to go to a tropical island and sacrifice himself to the volcano for the natives
05-01-2018T18:27:57,CrRAR,hahaha
05-01-2018T18:28:10,CrRAR,This is a perfect plot for the very moment we are in.
05-01-2018T18:29:12,SageSaga,came out in 1990
05-01-2018T18:29:49,TheBeckoner,yeah bgr I wanna go fast or peacefully
05-01-2018T18:29:51,CrRAR,The golden era of film~

05-01-2018T18:33:20,CrRAR,This should be in the Library of Congress!
05-01-2018T18:33:30,SageSaga,it does a great job of making you feel as depressed as he is in the beginning - everything is dark- muted- grey- terrible light-
05-01-2018T18:33:40,SageSaga,and then as the adventure begins it gets brighter and brighter
05-01-2018T18:34:36,CrRAR,"I'm probably going to watch this, legit."

05-01-2018T18:36:37,SageSaga,we didnt have internets back then
05-01-2018T18:36:51,FoxxTrotter,I have a boatload of DVDs.
05-01-2018T18:36:56,Bgrmystr2,"I didn't either, but I didn't really have movies"
05-01-2018T18:36:58,CrRAR,"same here, plus vidya games obvs"
05-01-2018T18:37:25,CrRAR,the premise of this movie reminds me of the Walter Mitty movie with Ben Stiller.
05-01-2018T18:37:28,TheBeckoner,I had a half movie half internet childhood
05-01-2018T18:37:32,CrRAR,That was pretty entertaining.
05-01-2018T18:37:42,SageSaga,i did grow up with a computer all my life though
05-01-2018T18:37:59,CrRAR,esp how you describe it getting brighter and more exciting
05-01-2018T18:38:01,Bgrmystr2,"lotta legos, had a computer by the age of 6ish.. 94 or so? Lotta SNES though"

05-01-2018T18:40:50,TheBeckoner,I'll probably just get it on PC
05-01-2018T18:41:30,SageSaga,the PC release date isnt set but either way if it comes out asap- fall is still 9 months away
05-01-2018T18:41:58,CrRAR,yeah they stay ambiguous with that because they want the other editions to sell well
05-01-2018T18:42:16,CrRAR,They got obligations to the console bros :&lt;
05-01-2018T18:42:40,SageSaga,actually they are taking the Port very seriously- they dont want to mess it up with a bad port to PC
05-01-2018T18:42:55,SageSaga,they flat out said they want the PC version to be the ultimate experiance
05-01-2018T18:43:03,CrRAR,"yeah a bad port, is worse than no port at all~"
05-01-2018T18:43:19,CrRAR,that comma shouldn't be there

05-01-2018T18:58:37,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I dunno? I'm not a kid person. So I ain't the best to be askin. :P"
05-01-2018T18:59:25,SageSaga,"hes my only good nephew, ive got 3 and the other 2 are garbage!"
05-01-2018T18:59:39,CrRAR,lol
05-01-2018T18:59:43,CrRAR,Reminds me of the audio clips Don Hertzfeldt used make World of Tomorrow with his niece.
05-01-2018T18:59:46,w0lfmare,Wow XD
05-01-2018T19:00:09,SageSaga,i blame their father- they take after him - that sack of garbage
05-01-2018T19:00:17,CrRAR,awww
05-01-2018T19:00:27,CrRAR,Someday they hopefully will learn~
05-01-2018T19:00:45,CrRAR,"""The age of Reason"" as it's called."
05-01-2018T19:01:33,SageSaga,"""Hey, did you know your body is mostly water? Like 60% water!"" ""NO IT ISNT! NO IT ISNT! ITS MOSTLY SKIN! FAKE NEWS!!!!"""
05-01-2018T19:01:47,CrRAR,...or yeah they could just grow up to be FLAMING piles of garbage.
05-01-2018T19:01:51,CrRAR,XD
05-01-2018T19:02:03,w0lfmare,Take away their internet
05-01-2018T19:02:08,CrRAR,Nooooo
05-01-2018T19:02:13,CrRAR,They NEED facts!
05-01-2018T19:02:14,w0lfmare,Then they'll be okay
05-01-2018T19:02:24,CrRAR,will it really? XD
05-01-2018T19:02:37,w0lfmare,"Well, as okay as children can be"
05-01-2018T19:03:00,CrRAR,If at adolescence stage they buy pickup trucks and install lift kits you will know where they stray~
05-01-2018T19:03:15,CrRAR,That will be true indicator~
05-01-2018T19:03:37,CrRAR,also the bigger the tires the worse it is.
05-01-2018T19:04:35,SageSaga,"""Hey kids! did you know your father is trash?"" ""Why do you keep saying that uncle Phil?"" ""So you'll learn!"""
05-01-2018T19:05:06,w0lfmare,Take his internet too
05-01-2018T19:05:07,sunblaze,very nice.
05-01-2018T19:05:08,Bgrmystr2,&lt;3 this soundtrack
05-01-2018T19:05:12,w0lfmare,:cw0lfmare-AriahHappy:
05-01-2018T19:05:13,CrRAR,lol
05-01-2018T19:05:14,sunblaze,let them learn for life anytime!
05-01-2018T19:07:14,CrRAR,Reminds me of a beautiful Steinbeck quote:
05-01-2018T19:07:18,SageSaga,"""I dont want my kids going over there anymore."" ""Why not?"" ""Every time they come back they call me trash man, I think their uncle is telling them strange things"""
05-01-2018T19:07:42,CrRAR,"“When a child first catches adults out -- when it first walks into his grave little head that adults do not always have divine intelligence, that their judgments are not always wise, their thinking true, their sentences just"""
05-01-2018T19:07:50,CrRAR,"""-- his world falls into panic desolation. The gods are fallen and all safety gone. And there is one sure thing about the fall of gods: they do not fall a little; they crash and shatter or sink deeply into green muck. It is a tedious job to build them up"
05-01-2018T19:08:27,CrRAR,Hopefully the children will learn~
05-01-2018T19:08:59,CrRAR,"also ""again; they never quite shine. And the child's world is never quite whole again. It is an aching kind of growing.”"""
05-01-2018T19:10:15,CrRAR,Steinbeck was a master.
05-01-2018T19:11:58,SageSaga,how many slaves did he have?
05-01-2018T19:12:09,CrRAR,lol
05-01-2018T19:15:51,CrRAR,I am one of the brotherhood of his literary following.
05-01-2018T19:15:57,CrRAR,dunno if that counts~
05-01-2018T19:16:17,CrRAR,If so they number in the THOUSANDS.
05-01-2018T19:26:37,SageSaga,Done!

05-01-2018T19:27:52,FoxxTrotter,Looks great. :0)
05-01-2018T19:28:15,Bgrmystr2,haven't seen Kaylin with that kind of look before
05-01-2018T19:28:24,Bgrmystr2,wonder what's goin on here
05-01-2018T19:30:09,SageSaga,shes starting to feel like shes really alone in this world
05-01-2018T19:30:19,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: SPOILERS
05-01-2018T19:30:26,CrRAR,oh teh noooo
05-01-2018T19:30:27,Bgrmystr2,yeah I can see that
05-01-2018T19:31:42,Bgrmystr2,"I'm awaiting the ""Join me on my journey"" page or"
05-01-2018T19:31:51,Bgrmystr2,whatever that ends up being
05-01-2018T19:32:26,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno when it's coming, but I know it is, I can FEEL it. :ptv-excited:"
05-01-2018T19:32:33,SageSaga,the 2 pages after this are some of my favorites
05-01-2018T19:32:36,w0lfmare,"I feel like Kaylin doesn't quite have her own journey yet. At least, not one with a clear path"
05-01-2018T19:32:49,Bgrmystr2,"Of course not w0lf, but she's going somewhere"
05-01-2018T19:33:31,SageSaga,she hasnt found a place- shes still just picking up quests and trying to learn what she can without getting side tracked by drinking
05-01-2018T19:33:58,SageSaga,she drinks... alot
05-01-2018T19:34:35,Bgrmystr2,yeh
05-01-2018T19:34:36,Bgrmystr2,xD
05-01-2018T19:34:40,SageSaga,helps with the suppression of anxiety of thinking she might just never wake up again because her real body dies
05-01-2018T19:35:24,Bgrmystr2,does that mean she'd be stuck in that world forever?
05-01-2018T19:35:26,SageSaga,and the thought that she might wake up and not remember her old life at all and just have this confusing journal
05-01-2018T19:35:28,Bgrmystr2,mentally?
05-01-2018T19:35:40,SageSaga,she doesnt know- she drinks to not think about it!
05-01-2018T19:35:45,Bgrmystr2,XD
05-01-2018T19:36:03,Bgrmystr2,She has the real questions of life.
05-01-2018T19:36:09,SageSaga,but when she gets a chance to learn more- well- she does want to know but shes been here for like over a month now-
05-01-2018T19:36:37,TheBeckoner,Im gonna read through this comic tonight so I'm not behind the boat anymore
05-01-2018T19:36:53,BluePhantom90,Well Sucks I will miss your Stream Tom. e-e Army will hold me over for a while. I might get home around at 5-6pm

05-01-2018T19:37:08,Bgrmystr2,I don't know if he's going to anyway
05-01-2018T19:37:09,SageSaga,if you have any problems with reading it let me know- the server has been going through some updates- a few things broke but i think AI is working
05-01-2018T19:37:31,SageSaga,Tom isnt streaming today-
05-01-2018T19:37:57,SageSaga,peace folks! shutting down the stream
05-01-2018T19:38:14,FoxxTrotter,"Thanks for the stream, Sage. G'night."
05-01-2018T19:38:23,CrRAR,Bye Sage~
05-01-2018T19:38:33,TheBeckoner,"Seeya Sage! I was having some issue with the page not loading when I clicked on ""Archive"" but evetually worked"
05-01-2018T19:38:42,FoxxTrotter,"Later, everyone. :0)"

05-01-2018T19:39:30,w0lfmare,"Later Sage, thanks for the stream"
05-01-2018T19:39:31,BluePhantom90,I meant Tomorrow. I have to drive home and Army takes forever to release. Hopefully this will be my last full day in the Army
05-01-2018T19:39:33,Bgrmystr2,Looking forward to the page sage :D thanks for streaming
05-01-2018T19:40:37,BluePhantom90,8 full years of Service. Hopefully I am done!
05-01-2018T19:41:24,TheBeckoner,"Gl Blue, hopefully you make it. Probably will though, Tom streams forever anyway."
05-01-2018T19:42:34,BluePhantom90,Tom has picked up the pace a bit. Just going a little too much into detail. I understand why but we fans will understand.
05-01-2018T19:43:02,TheBeckoner,Do what?
05-01-2018T19:43:10,SageSaga,https://twitter.com/forexposure_txt/status/949309515194802182
05-01-2018T19:44:02,BluePhantom90,less detail. Like the whole crazy background in some sketchs.
05-01-2018T19:44:04,TheBeckoner,Lol 12 year old dick trolls
05-01-2018T19:44:28,TheBeckoner,I like Toms trees though...
05-01-2018T19:44:59,BluePhantom90,He could do a quick addition to them later before he uploads them
05-01-2018T19:46:15,Bgrmystr2,"I don't know what exactly you're talking about or implying, blue. Tom puts out pages extremely fast, even with all the detail he puts into them"
05-01-2018T19:46:32,Bgrmystr2,not sure where you're going.
05-01-2018T19:47:26,BluePhantom90,Just saying. Not really complaining. Tom can do amazingly quick sketches.
05-01-2018T19:47:36,Bgrmystr2,"and yeh sage, I don't know if I would take that person seriously."
05-01-2018T19:48:03,Bgrmystr2,the age alone tells me to run away
05-01-2018T19:49:52,TheBeckoner,Wait is that Sages twitter?
05-01-2018T19:50:03,Bgrmystr2,no?

05-01-2018T22:56:59,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/EFUVHF1.jpg Going for it.
05-01-2018T22:58:18,Dadrobit,Ex brother in law is on the right.
05-01-2018T22:58:36,Bgrmystr2,"No stream, so I don't think the no links rule apply, plus you're not a random person :P"
05-01-2018T22:58:41,Bgrmystr2,so there's that
05-01-2018T22:59:21,Bgrmystr2,"I wish the couple the best, Dadro :)"
05-01-2018T22:59:49,Dadrobit,I still try to be decent with my posting habits. Honest.
05-01-2018T23:00:45,Dadrobit,And they definitely are gonna last. They're both awesome people who take great care of my nephew and my sister.
05-01-2018T23:01:18,unsteddyphoenix,That cake is pretty sweet
05-01-2018T23:01:26,unsteddyphoenix,Good cake = good marriage im pretty sure
05-01-2018T23:01:34,Dadrobit,Sister made it for them.

05-01-2018T23:03:42,Dadrobit,"Yeah, whole thing was peacock themed. Lotsa colorful feathers and birds everywhere."
05-01-2018T23:06:39,Dadrobit,And then there's grandad in the back in his Hawaiian  marijuana shirt.

05-01-2018T23:16:44,Bgrmystr2,"Hey, just because he displays it on the outside does not mean it doesn't come from the inside."
05-01-2018T23:17:26,Bgrmystr2,Rocking the attitude is a bonus plus. :thumbsup:
