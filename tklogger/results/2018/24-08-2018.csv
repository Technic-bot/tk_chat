24-08-2018T00:02:30,Dadrobit,"But yeah, it literally just happened out of nowhere. She was just fine this morning. Then I noticed her labored breathing and stumbling. She was gone in maybe 25-30 minutes, just as I got her to the vet. Zero warning. Nothing could have been done."

24-08-2018T01:21:41,Laleaf,hi :)
24-08-2018T01:22:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Leaf
24-08-2018T01:23:41,unsteddyphoenix,yo
24-08-2018T01:26:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Something tells me Trace is suspicious
24-08-2018T01:26:48,MrEase,I wonder why I don't see anything wrong
24-08-2018T01:26:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,He's thinking about his options
24-08-2018T01:26:57,MrEase,upgrade
24-08-2018T01:27:12,unsteddyphoenix,He's literally dealt with this trick before
24-08-2018T01:27:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Hair looks like it could use some frizz-ease
24-08-2018T01:27:28,Twokinds,"""Waaaait a minute... Flora's eyes aren't yellow!"""
24-08-2018T01:27:34,RimaDraws,^
24-08-2018T01:27:37,SpazztasticKiwi,“I got contacts”
24-08-2018T01:27:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Bet you she’d try that
24-08-2018T01:27:49,MrEase,I'd bet money that Nora did this with Saria too
24-08-2018T01:27:51,butidontwantto,you suspect Trace in being suspicious?
24-08-2018T01:28:01,unsteddyphoenix,Uhh...
24-08-2018T01:28:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,They are yellow tho
24-08-2018T01:28:40,Twokinds,"""my mistake"""

24-08-2018T01:29:05,SpazztasticKiwi,“Hopefully there’s no nuts”
24-08-2018T01:29:09,Bgrmystr2,Probably a caterpie.
24-08-2018T01:29:13,unsteddyphoenix,"""SOMEthings wrong though. New haircut?"""
24-08-2018T01:29:30,SageSaga,Heracross
24-08-2018T01:29:41,Bgrmystr2,Every time I shake trees.. caterpie.. my luck is terribad
24-08-2018T01:29:56,Bgrmystr2,"not that it matters, cuz I just look for high level grass pokemon to burn :v"
24-08-2018T01:30:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I get a rock every time I shake a tree
24-08-2018T01:30:36,SageSaga,i'd be terrified if i shook a tree and a nearly 5 foot tall rhino beetle looking monster fell out
24-08-2018T01:31:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Beedrill is recorded as being 3 feet tall
24-08-2018T01:31:04,unsteddyphoenix,Well then dont shake his tree!
24-08-2018T01:31:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Pokémon don’t need to exist
24-08-2018T01:31:24,Bgrmystr2,"still weak to fire sage, so I'd just burn it."
24-08-2018T01:31:30,Bgrmystr2,No witnesses!
24-08-2018T01:31:56,MrEase,"Every once in a while I'd be like, man it would be cool if pokemon existed"
24-08-2018T01:32:23,MrEase,"but then nightmarish shit like Jellicent murdering sailors by the shipload would exist, and I'm like, nope"
24-08-2018T01:32:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Let me repeat: a threefoottallbee
24-08-2018T01:32:51,MrEase,don't read the pokedex entries :V
24-08-2018T01:33:03,SageSaga,i would capture a Mismagus
24-08-2018T01:33:43,MrEase,"""oh this poison thing just floated past my house spraying toxic fumes everywhere, guess I'm suffocating now"""
24-08-2018T01:34:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to know what they did to Ash’s face in the remake
24-08-2018T01:34:44,SpazztasticKiwi,The restyle is awful
24-08-2018T01:34:47,Alphawolf333,smooth
24-08-2018T01:35:06,Alphawolf333,Nah it's odd to me growing up on it but it's not bad
24-08-2018T01:35:08,MrEase,"It looks so good in motion, you're crazy lol"
24-08-2018T01:35:23,MrEase,yeah its minimalist and looks bad in stills
24-08-2018T01:35:33,SpazztasticKiwi,“Are your boobs bigger?”
24-08-2018T01:35:37,MrEase,but Sun/Moon anime's animation is top notch
24-08-2018T01:35:37,Bgrmystr2,"Oh, someone sent out a Magcargo nearby.. I guess I will just burn to death along with the rest of the block.."
24-08-2018T01:35:46,SageSaga,you wouldnt
24-08-2018T01:36:04,SageSaga,thermodynamics dont work that way
24-08-2018T01:36:34,Bgrmystr2,"10,000°C though.."
24-08-2018T01:36:42,Bgrmystr2,that's a little much
24-08-2018T01:36:59,SageSaga,only if you put your hand on it
24-08-2018T01:37:03,Alphawolf333,"it would take a while, though"
24-08-2018T01:37:20,MrEase,that kind of heat would radiate a good distance
24-08-2018T01:37:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"Seriously though. Boobs are bigger. Boyfriend gonna notice something like that, right?"
24-08-2018T01:37:26,Bgrmystr2,"yeah exactly, Ease"
24-08-2018T01:37:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Right?!?
24-08-2018T01:37:41,TheBeckoner,Notice it as a sudden plus
24-08-2018T01:37:46,SageSaga,we have created heat on earth over 5 trillion degrees Celsius- the world still exists :P
24-08-2018T01:37:58,Mihari,"You've been pregnant for 3 years, they've bound to swell a little *nods*"
24-08-2018T01:38:05,Alphawolf333,the sudden heat would take time to expand outwards
24-08-2018T01:38:07,Bgrmystr2,lol Mihari's got it
24-08-2018T01:38:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tru, but then where’s the baby bump?"
24-08-2018T01:38:22,MrEase,"even if it tapers off to 5000 5 feet away, everything within 5 feet of it, as its moving  would also start burning"
24-08-2018T01:38:34,Bgrmystr2,"it transitioned, kiwi"
24-08-2018T01:38:37,Bgrmystr2,now it's in her boobs
24-08-2018T01:38:40,Bgrmystr2,instead of her stomache
24-08-2018T01:38:46,Bgrmystr2,it makes perfect sence shutup
24-08-2018T01:38:48,SpazztasticKiwi,She is having twins !
24-08-2018T01:39:03,Bgrmystr2,sense* even
24-08-2018T01:39:16,MrEase,"I honestly wish the disguise was a little worse, it would be funnier"
24-08-2018T01:39:23,SageSaga,well you have 2 options when it comes to Magcargo - either 1 - these creatures slay everyone and everything that get within a few meters of them-
24-08-2018T01:39:25,Mihari,"I didn't say it was perfect, that would just be the boob rational, there is other plenty of tell notices."
24-08-2018T01:39:30,Mihari,No pun intended.
24-08-2018T01:39:51,SageSaga,or someone decided to not look up how hot magma is when they wrote a pokedex entry
24-08-2018T01:40:08,Bgrmystr2,xD sage
24-08-2018T01:40:13,Bgrmystr2,yeah prettymuch
24-08-2018T01:40:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"Flora standing casually behind Trace, royally pissed he’s taking so long to come to a conclusion"
24-08-2018T01:40:29,SageSaga,also in the anime im pretty sure they showed someone petting one-
24-08-2018T01:40:31,TheBeckoner,Or third - They didn't care that much
24-08-2018T01:40:42,MrEase,"I'm sure Flora is incapacitated, Nora wants him all to herself"
24-08-2018T01:40:46,SageSaga,that's the same thing as not doing it
24-08-2018T01:40:49,SpazztasticKiwi,“ no one actually gonna look this up “
24-08-2018T01:40:53,Bgrmystr2,yeah.... the anime doesn't bother listening to the pokedex
24-08-2018T01:41:13,Mihari,"If Nora really wanted Trace and she had to negotiate with Flora it would be a simple, ""Lemme barrow him on Tuesdays and you get these"" Easy sell."
24-08-2018T01:41:32,Bgrmystr2,"prettymuch, Mihari"
24-08-2018T01:41:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"Nice little.....beautymark (?) you adding there, Tom"
24-08-2018T01:41:57,SageSaga,im just saying- because of how thermodynamics works- the heat they put off isnt as dangerous as many say
24-08-2018T01:41:59,BadFoMo,"@SpazztasticKiwi Flora: Come on, Trace! What's taking so long?! Trace: ...Sorry about that. I was AFK. ...Looking at a walkthrough."
24-08-2018T01:42:04,Bgrmystr2,"it was there in the sketch, kiwi"
24-08-2018T01:42:05,SageSaga,and also most likely its just wrong
24-08-2018T01:42:57,MrEase,"~~I've still never figured out if Nora was joking when she said she was planning on eating Flora Keith and Nat when we first got introduced to her, or if she was serious~~"
24-08-2018T01:43:02,Alphawolf333,"the popular theory is that since it's kids writing the entries they're woefully blown out of proportion, but thats just... nah jokes been overdone"
24-08-2018T01:43:52,MrEase,"also who names pokemon, in universe"
24-08-2018T01:44:13,MrEase,"is it the professor who lives in the region, the first person to discover them"
24-08-2018T01:44:19,MrEase,because some of those names suck
24-08-2018T01:44:20,Alphawolf333,"If we're going by anime, probably the pokemon. Games: ???"
24-08-2018T01:44:28,TheBeckoner,So what's the beauty mark from?
24-08-2018T01:44:35,TheBeckoner,did I miss something?
24-08-2018T01:44:41,MrEase,Its a pheasant. And its a jerk.
24-08-2018T01:44:48,MrEase,Its unfeasant
24-08-2018T01:44:55,MrEase,like... unpleasant
24-08-2018T01:44:59,SpazztasticKiwi,:ptv-unimpressed:
24-08-2018T01:45:11,MrEase,that is this creatures name for the entire species for all time now
24-08-2018T01:45:19,MrEase,who decides that
24-08-2018T01:45:58,MrEase,~~and how do they even know what a Pheasant is~~
24-08-2018T01:46:02,Bgrmystr2,"well I mean.. pikachu literally says ""pikachu"" but is that canonical to the games? Or is it only canonical to the anime to make it cuter and sell more shit?"
24-08-2018T01:46:16,MrEase,its canonical to the games now
24-08-2018T01:46:21,MrEase,but only for pikachu
24-08-2018T01:46:27,Alphawolf333,realistically it'd be most likely the person who discovers it. Until a more agreed upon name is chosen
24-08-2018T01:46:50,Bgrmystr2,"cuz if pikachu literally says it's own name, then yeah it would make sense that other pokemon say their names too.. for the most part.."
24-08-2018T01:47:14,Alphawolf333,as for the pheasant thing. They do refer to pikachu as the Rat pokemon and such so they know what normal animals are
24-08-2018T01:47:17,Mihari,You forgot the movie where Pikachu actually talked XD
24-08-2018T01:47:28,Bgrmystr2,I never saw it so to me it doesn't exist :V
24-08-2018T01:47:42,unsteddyphoenix,Oh god I deleted that clip from my mind lol
24-08-2018T01:47:43,Mihari,That line of thinking explains so much to me about you.
24-08-2018T01:47:43,SageSaga,im pretty sure that was Ash having a fever dream
24-08-2018T01:48:04,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah didnt they justify it by saying like ""it's because Ash can UNDERSTAND pikachus SOUL"""
24-08-2018T01:48:17,Bgrmystr2,"lol, I actually had forgotten that was even a thing, so I didn't even consider it lol"
24-08-2018T01:48:31,Bgrmystr2,can't consider what I don't remember lol
24-08-2018T01:48:48,TheBeckoner,Huh I also blocked that movie from my head
24-08-2018T01:49:01,MrEase,"I still love that video, of the theatre watching that movie, going ""WTF"" to pikachu talking"
24-08-2018T01:49:08,unsteddyphoenix,Oh yeah
24-08-2018T01:49:13,unsteddyphoenix,The reaction is priceless
24-08-2018T01:49:52,Alphawolf333,I know I did it when I saw it
24-08-2018T01:50:18,Bgrmystr2,"also, isn't talking pikachu just part of that movie? It's probably not even canonical to the games anyway"
24-08-2018T01:50:28,Bgrmystr2,I dunno though
24-08-2018T01:50:37,Bgrmystr2,I haven't been in the pokemon scene in years
24-08-2018T01:50:52,Mihari,"Who knows, even if it is now, they might just reboot again later."
24-08-2018T01:51:21,Bgrmystr2,xD Yeah...
24-08-2018T01:51:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Trace uses the squint of inspecting
24-08-2018T01:51:58,Bgrmystr2,One of the reasons why I don't regret moving onto other things by the time Gen 3 was becoming a big thing
24-08-2018T01:52:06,SageSaga,im hoping the main line game for the Switch that is supposed to come out next year reboots Pokemon
24-08-2018T01:53:23,SageSaga,"Mewtwo will pull a Scarlet Witch and whisper- ""No more Satoshi"""
24-08-2018T01:54:02,sunblaze,*opens picarto and sees Floras breasts*
24-08-2018T01:54:04,sunblaze,yay :D
24-08-2018T01:54:08,unsteddyphoenix,Where!
24-08-2018T01:54:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel like I’ve seen that expression Trace has before
24-08-2018T01:54:39,SpazztasticKiwi,What breasts? How dare you use such language!
24-08-2018T01:54:40,sunblaze,and good morning everyone
24-08-2018T01:54:45,Alphawolf333,"I would at this point enjoy a more changing cast when it comes to the anime. Seeing ash go ""OH WOW WHATS THIS POKEMON"" to a spearow only works so many times"
24-08-2018T01:55:47,SageSaga,"i want Ash to see a Pikachu and be like ""WOW! What is that!"" and they are like ""My God- he- he has brain damage"""
24-08-2018T01:56:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Being 14 for a few years I bet he does
24-08-2018T01:56:13,sunblaze,@SpazztasticKiwi its my dirty mind. so many years of interwebs ruined it. :ptv-snicker:
24-08-2018T01:56:15,SageSaga,10
24-08-2018T01:56:18,SageSaga,hes been 10
24-08-2018T01:56:19,unsteddyphoenix,Something something he's in a coma
24-08-2018T01:56:28,SageSaga,for like- a long time
24-08-2018T01:56:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I thought they aged him a little
24-08-2018T01:56:38,Bgrmystr2,isn't he supposed to be in his mid-20s now?
24-08-2018T01:56:41,SpazztasticKiwi,For newer stuff
24-08-2018T01:56:44,SageSaga,ha-haha-hahahaha!
24-08-2018T01:56:52,SageSaga,he's 10 again
24-08-2018T01:56:55,SageSaga,not even joking
24-08-2018T01:56:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Aw
24-08-2018T01:56:58,Bgrmystr2,yeah they never age him
24-08-2018T01:57:18,Bgrmystr2,"I think I remember reading that he should have been like 20 something years old though, if everything really did take as long as it should have"
24-08-2018T01:57:20,sunblaze,maybe the place where pokemon plays simply had a huuuuuge orbit for the sun and like 3000 days / year
24-08-2018T01:57:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"Ok, well being 10 for that long can’t be good for the brain either"
24-08-2018T01:57:27,Twokinds,It's such an easy fix
24-08-2018T01:57:47,Bgrmystr2,loooool Sun xD
24-08-2018T01:57:48,Bgrmystr2,maybe
24-08-2018T01:57:51,SpazztasticKiwi,...go on
24-08-2018T01:57:52,Twokinds,"Just have someone else say ""what is that?"" and have ash say ""oh yeah thats so-and-so I caught it like three regions ago"""
24-08-2018T01:58:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Good fix
24-08-2018T01:58:09,unsteddyphoenix,Then he suddenly ages?
24-08-2018T01:58:11,Alphawolf333,they did that in kalos at one point
24-08-2018T01:58:15,SpazztasticKiwi,But would they take it
24-08-2018T01:58:16,Alphawolf333,And it was good
24-08-2018T01:58:41,Bgrmystr2,lol.. I want the pokedex ash gets in the anime.. in the game. cuz it's already got a huge list of mons
24-08-2018T01:58:42,SpazztasticKiwi,New plot idea: Ash ages every time he shows self-awareness
24-08-2018T01:58:48,Bgrmystr2,and in the game it's goddamn empty
24-08-2018T01:58:58,SageSaga,"""OMG A TARUOS! IVE NEVER SEEN ONE BEFORE!"" Seriously?! You caught like a hundred of them!"""
24-08-2018T01:59:16,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao thats right he caught a herd of tauros
24-08-2018T01:59:22,Bgrmystr2,wtf kind of professor of pokemon gives you his personal pokedex which has NO POKEMON registered? Did he wipe it before he gave it to you?
24-08-2018T01:59:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Are we sure it’s team rocket they keep knocking around?
24-08-2018T01:59:41,sunblaze,probably wiped it because porn was saved on it
24-08-2018T01:59:47,Bgrmystr2,haha sun
24-08-2018T01:59:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Rule 34
24-08-2018T02:00:08,SpazztasticKiwi,(I’ll go now)
24-08-2018T02:00:16,MrEase,"I have to delete all the info on mating habits so the kids don't see, OOPS there went the entire pokedex"
24-08-2018T02:00:34,sunblaze,^bleivable

24-08-2018T02:01:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Shots fired

24-08-2018T02:01:21,Bgrmystr2,"literally and figuratively, kiwi :ptv-laugh:"
24-08-2018T02:01:22,unsteddyphoenix,guns dont exist in 4kids pokemon sage dnot be silly
24-08-2018T02:01:26,MrEase,you don't have to go haha
24-08-2018T02:01:32,SageSaga,are you SURE?!
24-08-2018T02:01:37,Bgrmystr2,"does ANYONE even watch that anymore, phoenix"
24-08-2018T02:01:44,MrEase,I mean 4kids doesn't do pokemon anymore
24-08-2018T02:01:47,unsteddyphoenix,Yes theyre literally edited out
24-08-2018T02:01:57,SageSaga,https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/thumb/3/32/Gun.png/220px-Gun.png
24-08-2018T02:02:00,unsteddyphoenix,Well thats what I watched so thats the only one that's real to me
24-08-2018T02:02:04,Alphawolf333,They had two episodes with it
24-08-2018T02:02:16,Alphawolf333,one even had a bazooka
24-08-2018T02:02:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"Sir, it’s basic gun etiquette not to point one loaded or not at another person. How dare you"
24-08-2018T02:03:02,Bgrmystr2,"I think 4kids edited that part out, sage"
24-08-2018T02:03:02,sunblaze,in that case how is a pokemon that needs like 3 rounds to set up cry random battle stances and attacks only on command better then a well places shot?
24-08-2018T02:03:23,unsteddyphoenix,Yup that gun doesnt exist
24-08-2018T02:03:25,Alphawolf333,"The other episode was hosted on 4kids for a while i believe, the tentacruel one"

24-08-2018T02:06:46,unsteddyphoenix,I am a big fan of tomtom
24-08-2018T02:06:51,sunblaze,tom achieved: humility!
24-08-2018T02:06:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Now good night 😴😀
24-08-2018T02:06:56,TheBeckoner,Can Tom-Tom tell me where I need to go?
24-08-2018T02:07:09,Mihari,After you take the roundabout.
24-08-2018T02:07:39,Alphawolf333,but i've been turning right for like 12 minutes now
24-08-2018T02:08:05,Bgrmystr2,"you accidentally, Alpha"
24-08-2018T02:08:31,Alphawolf333,Eh it's 3 I get a few passes
24-08-2018T02:08:45,Bgrmystr2,fair 'nuff
24-08-2018T02:09:01,Bgrmystr2,but only a few.
24-08-2018T02:09:04,TheBeckoner,Man I have work tomorrow...I should probably sleep
24-08-2018T02:09:09,TheBeckoner,but will not
24-08-2018T02:09:16,Bgrmystr2,streams aren't over tho beck
24-08-2018T02:09:31,TheBeckoner,Thats the thing
24-08-2018T02:09:34,Bgrmystr2,"you'd wouldn't quit on us now, would you?"
24-08-2018T02:09:34,sunblaze,sleep is overrated anyway
24-08-2018T02:09:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,sleep is comfy
24-08-2018T02:10:00,TheBeckoner,Alright I'm swayed. Ill stay up till atleast 5:30
24-08-2018T02:10:06,Bgrmystr2,ayy
24-08-2018T02:10:21,sunblaze,wow tom close up Flora looks even more lustous
24-08-2018T02:10:39,Bgrmystr2,lolol
24-08-2018T02:10:58,Bgrmystr2,I dunno.. I think the real flora would be able to equal that.
24-08-2018T02:11:08,sunblaze,but I guess thats her charm looking sexy even without breasts involved
24-08-2018T02:12:17,thestooge,good night guys!
24-08-2018T02:12:21,unsteddyphoenix,So youre saying Flora looks sexier than normal?
24-08-2018T02:12:25,Bgrmystr2,quitter spotted
24-08-2018T02:12:29,Bgrmystr2,gnight stooge :D
24-08-2018T02:12:34,MrEase,"yes sunblaze... ""Flora"""
24-08-2018T02:12:37,sunblaze,bye
24-08-2018T02:13:03,Bgrmystr2,"hmm.. no phoenix, I think flora always looks sexy. :v"
24-08-2018T02:13:23,Bgrmystr2,that's the only right answer with her anyway
24-08-2018T02:13:26,sunblaze,@unsteddyphoenix difficult to say for a character that runs around naked 90% of the time anyway :P
24-08-2018T02:13:36,unsteddyphoenix,But does Nora make a better flora than flora :P
24-08-2018T02:13:46,MrEase,"Tom should add hints of those little belly scale markings on the white part of Nora/Flora's chest, just for a bit more obvious-ness"
24-08-2018T02:13:52,sunblaze,dragons make everything better. we know that
24-08-2018T02:13:58,MrEase,Chest/belly
24-08-2018T02:14:05,Bgrmystr2,"I'd say no, cuz Nora's still nora. She's just better at filling out a body than flora is."
24-08-2018T02:14:12,Bgrmystr2,"cuz, yknow, dragon"
24-08-2018T02:14:14,Mihari,"Pointy tail, bigger boobs, eyes, horns, not enough hints? XD"
24-08-2018T02:14:26,Bgrmystr2,"no Mihari, need moar"
24-08-2018T02:14:30,MrEase,"I think its obvious, but it could be more obvious"
24-08-2018T02:14:46,MrEase,and that would make traces doubt funnier
24-08-2018T02:14:51,unsteddyphoenix,"Also the ""hay it's me your girlfriend"" dialogue"
24-08-2018T02:15:20,Twokinds,"What Nora does not know, is that this is actually Eric disguised as Trace to get with Flora"
24-08-2018T02:15:21,MrEase,hello tis I your girlfriend tiger
24-08-2018T02:15:28,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, Nora is probably fully capable of transforming into flora's EXACT looks.. so her not looking exactly like flora probably on purpose"
24-08-2018T02:15:35,Bgrmystr2,XD Tom
24-08-2018T02:15:37,sunblaze,plot twist!
24-08-2018T02:15:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,now thats a ship
24-08-2018T02:15:46,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha

24-08-2018T02:16:29,Bgrmystr2,I think eric's gonna find out he's been missing out on what he REALLY wants to be drawing this whole time....
24-08-2018T02:16:55,Queer,:3
24-08-2018T02:17:15,unsteddyphoenix,converted to dragon-cultist after one night
24-08-2018T02:17:20,SageSaga,Tom - remember who i ship with Eric?
24-08-2018T02:17:27,unsteddyphoenix,Is it Raine

24-08-2018T02:19:36,Twokinds,I don't remember you saying that
24-08-2018T02:20:03,SageSaga,wow you blocked out me talking about his sister is wearing Kat's skin like a fursuit
24-08-2018T02:20:13,unsteddyphoenix,jesus christ

24-08-2018T02:20:56,unsteddyphoenix,He's gone mad with power
24-08-2018T02:21:15,Bgrmystr2,"rofl, he's toggled, marv? xD"

24-08-2018T02:22:25,unsteddyphoenix,Goddamn FURRIES
24-08-2018T02:22:26,Bgrmystr2,"Man, I actually remember that conversation about Eric's pirate sister"
24-08-2018T02:22:39,Bgrmystr2,don't recall the suit part though..
24-08-2018T02:22:39,MrEase,that mansion has enough implied nightmare fuel to build something off of
24-08-2018T02:22:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I have no memory of Pirate sister XD
24-08-2018T02:22:45,Bgrmystr2,I think it went downhill after that
24-08-2018T02:22:48,Bgrmystr2,aw marv

24-08-2018T02:23:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I don't know
24-08-2018T02:23:30,MrEase,"why have Erics Pirate sister, when you can have an AU where Kat becomes a pirate"
24-08-2018T02:23:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I think I would remember pirate sister tho
24-08-2018T02:23:35,MrEase,I want Pirate Kat
24-08-2018T02:24:08,Bgrmystr2,"something something plottwist, Kat *IS* his pirate sister"
24-08-2018T02:24:10,unsteddyphoenix,damn youre making sense
24-08-2018T02:24:27,MrEase,yeah of course thats why she's wearing her skin

24-08-2018T04:19:02,Bgrmystr2,"Nora cards are a full color, background, and shaded image. He did a bunch of nora cards today because he has a large backlog of them."

24-08-2018T14:52:52,SageSaga,yeah from his game he can access a Command Console - Kaylin can access her hud but not a command console
24-08-2018T14:53:47,SageSaga,im pretty sure i showed her using it to access a bank-
24-08-2018T14:53:53,Bgrmystr2,ah okay
24-08-2018T14:54:11,Bgrmystr2,I wasn't sure if it was an admin prompt or a cheat menu or what lol
24-08-2018T14:54:48,SageSaga,http://ai.katbox.net/comic/a-different-world-01/
24-08-2018T14:54:49,Bgrmystr2,dunno too many games that use a cmd box instead of an HUD
24-08-2018T14:55:21,SageSaga,it is the same thing people use to cheat in many games
24-08-2018T14:56:12,SageSaga,they are normally meant for admins and testers but most games keep them active but limit their actions
24-08-2018T14:56:40,SageSaga,so he cant just type in /godmode 1
24-08-2018T14:57:02,SageSaga,but- it does have some functions - it'll be explained in this comic
24-08-2018T14:57:04,Bgrmystr2,"right, yeah, that's what I thought it looked like"
24-08-2018T14:57:08,Bgrmystr2,cool
24-08-2018T14:57:29,SageSaga,"btw- Panel 2 here - ""Wait- you can cheat?"""

24-08-2018T15:13:02,dragonfire421,Well Sage I deffently think you have a new fan here. Can't wait to see the who story.
24-08-2018T15:13:37,SageSaga,"i said ""it was 440 USD"" and he said ""I've never spent more than 200 dollars on a graphics card"" so i called him a filthy casual"
24-08-2018T15:13:47,SageSaga,thanks Dragonfire XD
24-08-2018T15:14:32,SageSaga,"i like joking to him about being a ""PC Gamer Master Race"" because hes a mac boy"

24-08-2018T15:16:59,dragonfire421,"I've started and I have a feeling its gonna take awhile, but I know it ain't gonna take me as long as when I started TwoKinds all those years ago."
24-08-2018T15:17:34,SageSaga,AI is much shorter atm- but Yosh is much longer
24-08-2018T15:18:38,SageSaga,i started Yosh a month after Tom started Twokinds
24-08-2018T15:19:11,SageSaga,he helped me get my first website setup
24-08-2018T15:19:47,dragonfire421,Awesome man! Great to see it happen!
24-08-2018T15:20:18,SageSaga,that was almost 15 years ago
24-08-2018T15:20:50,dragonfire421,Man now I can't wait to catch up to modern day!
24-08-2018T15:21:19,SageSaga,what comic are ya reading? AI?

24-08-2018T15:26:11,SageSaga,np
24-08-2018T15:32:24,Bgrmystr2,"speaking of that, I have been reading the latest pages of Yosh"
24-08-2018T15:33:10,Bgrmystr2,"they're not bad, but there's too much I don't understand"
24-08-2018T15:33:19,Bgrmystr2,I gotta go back and read the whole thing
24-08-2018T15:33:55,SageSaga,good luck
24-08-2018T15:33:58,CrimsonQuill,@SageSaga I'm going to start Yoshi this week.

24-08-2018T15:34:39,Twokinds,gotta turn that i upside down
24-08-2018T15:34:51,Bgrmystr2,"poor sage, maybe next time he won't lose to Nintendo"
24-08-2018T15:35:25,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds @SageSaga How'd you two meet each other?
24-08-2018T15:35:38,Bgrmystr2,"and he ignores it, nicely done"
24-08-2018T15:35:40,Bgrmystr2,xD
24-08-2018T15:35:48,CrimsonQuill,"Sigh,,,"
24-08-2018T15:36:11,SageSaga,i stalked Tom for a while and then once I saw an opening i captured him and brainwashed him into liking me
24-08-2018T15:36:16,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, I don't think I've heard how you guys met lol"
24-08-2018T15:36:30,Bgrmystr2,"also, that sounds fairly accurate for you sage"
24-08-2018T15:37:06,Bgrmystr2,does tom have a different version? :P
24-08-2018T15:37:44,CrimsonQuill,I'd like to hear it
24-08-2018T15:40:47,SageSaga,"from my perspective - I was in college, I had been drawing comics in class-  shared them on an internet forum, everyone said i should get a website- i was reading several comics- found Twokinds- it reminded me of some the stories i had written before-"
24-08-2018T15:41:08,FoxxTrotter,:0)
24-08-2018T15:41:45,SageSaga,found out he had a little chatroom - i joined- we chatted - I asked him about hosting - I applied for a page on Keenspace now called Comic Genesis if its still around -
24-08-2018T15:43:01,SageSaga,we shared art and drew silly things for eachother - he helped me get started and I provided a critique on his work that i guess was of some value
24-08-2018T15:43:41,SageSaga,he helped me figure out how keenspace worked and didnt make fun of my terrible web design!
24-08-2018T15:43:49,CrimsonQuill,@SageSaga my sister wants to make a webcomic on that site.
24-08-2018T15:44:08,CrimsonQuill,Though she hasn't seen Yosh
24-08-2018T15:45:26,Bgrmystr2,lool the truth comes out
24-08-2018T15:45:30,Bgrmystr2,sounds like you guys had fun sag
24-08-2018T15:45:31,Bgrmystr2,e
24-08-2018T15:46:02,Bgrmystr2,wrong hand was faster Dx
24-08-2018T15:47:20,SageSaga,thats my perspective- Tom's may be different
24-08-2018T15:47:35,CrimsonQuill,It's always a matter of perspective
24-08-2018T15:52:08,Rosscoe,"Sorry I am bouncing in and out, got dinner cooking"
24-08-2018T15:54:03,Twokinds,"Sage and I were bankrobbers around the turn of the century. And then we figured, the best way to launder the money? Webcomics"

24-08-2018T16:00:10,Bgrmystr2,"yeah I wouldn't have gotten that, but it did sound familiar. I never did watch much of that show, sage."
24-08-2018T16:00:34,SageSaga,Conan did do a crossover movie with Lupin :P
24-08-2018T16:00:52,Bgrmystr2,I did not know this :thinking:

24-08-2018T16:13:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not sure how to respond to that
24-08-2018T16:14:14,SpazztasticKiwi,So I’ll just say you do you 👍🏻
24-08-2018T16:14:52,SageSaga,"or you could say ""What an amazing emote! I shall subscribe to Sage to get it!"""

24-08-2018T16:16:31,SageSaga,women can like boobs too
24-08-2018T16:16:44,Bgrmystr2,"the other alternative would not be SFW, though.. so I mean.. sage doesn't have a lot of wiggle room in that regard"
24-08-2018T16:16:52,sunblaze,indeed boobs are great for everyone!
24-08-2018T16:17:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"Oh they’re great. It’s just if you have em, it’s a case of “you’ve seen one, you seen em all”"
24-08-2018T16:17:45,SageSaga,i have seen and drawn many different kinds of boobs
24-08-2018T16:18:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"Do I say, “I’m so proud”?"
24-08-2018T16:18:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Or “congratulations”?
24-08-2018T16:18:34,SageSaga,"it runs counter to the point ""all boobs are the same"" so no that would be a weird thing to say to that"
24-08-2018T16:18:44,sunblaze,sage expierenced ALL the boobs
24-08-2018T16:18:59,Bgrmystr2,"I wouldn't say ""all"""
24-08-2018T16:19:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though of course they’re relatively easy to draw, it’s getting the physics of them down"
24-08-2018T16:19:06,CrimsonQuill,I'm thinking more about the blue-footed boobies.
24-08-2018T16:19:11,CrimsonQuill,They're a seabird.
24-08-2018T16:19:20,CrimsonQuill,They dive into the water in massive flocks.
24-08-2018T16:19:30,CrimsonQuill,Yep. Totally out of context.
24-08-2018T16:19:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"For example, some artists I’ve seen draw their version of boobs think they sit up. It’s like no, the bra does that."
24-08-2018T16:20:13,Bgrmystr2,"We know, Quill, of the bird"
24-08-2018T16:20:20,SageSaga,bra or other support structure
24-08-2018T16:21:03,SageSaga,breasts fall to the sides generally so cleavage on a braless woman only works if some force is pushing them together- see people mess that up all the time
24-08-2018T16:21:33,CrimsonQuill,Like Cortana in Halo 4?
24-08-2018T16:21:49,Bgrmystr2,"Cortana isn't real, she's a computer-generated image"
24-08-2018T16:21:51,SpazztasticKiwi,And sports bras often “take some air out of them” so to speak since those things are meant to hold things in place even in an earthquake
24-08-2018T16:21:55,Bgrmystr2,so she doesn't count Quill
24-08-2018T16:22:19,SpazztasticKiwi,And exactly. I’ve seen examples of double clevage cause some people don’t know how boobs boob
24-08-2018T16:22:39,SageSaga,yeah - a girl wearing a sports bra can look way smaller in bust than they are
24-08-2018T16:23:35,SpazztasticKiwi,The funniest thing I’ve had happen is someone asking me “how do you know?” when I correct them on how something feminine looks
24-08-2018T16:23:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I just “Are....are you blind?”
24-08-2018T16:24:10,SageSaga,"a long time ago someone showed me a picture - i think if you type in ""Sports Bra Sorcery"" you'll find it in google image search"
24-08-2018T16:24:30,Bgrmystr2,xDD
24-08-2018T16:25:18,SageSaga,did it work?
24-08-2018T16:25:50,Bgrmystr2,yeah 2nd image
24-08-2018T16:26:02,Rosscoe,goes to look this up
24-08-2018T16:26:04,Bgrmystr2,though I'm not sure if it's real or just meme
24-08-2018T16:26:06,SageSaga,understanding how breasts work is important for drawing many women
24-08-2018T16:26:35,SageSaga,if its the one i think it is- it is real- girl did it in a youtube video to show it
24-08-2018T16:26:40,Bgrmystr2,"I know sports bras work, but to that effect? I'm obscenely skeptical"
24-08-2018T16:26:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Is that padding?
24-08-2018T16:26:46,SageSaga,thats what the 2 images are from
24-08-2018T16:27:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause it looks like they’re using padding for that shape
24-08-2018T16:27:00,Bgrmystr2,can I link the img I'm lookin at? :o
24-08-2018T16:27:07,SageSaga,go ahead
24-08-2018T16:27:13,Rosscoe,that is some magic
24-08-2018T16:27:23,Bgrmystr2,"https://johnjohns1.fjcdn.com/pictures/What+is+this+sorcery_d5a757_4017963.jpg no super long google link, you can thank me later"
24-08-2018T16:27:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Well for some boobs are magic so
24-08-2018T16:27:30,Bgrmystr2,can*
24-08-2018T16:27:35,SageSaga,that is the one
24-08-2018T16:27:50,Bgrmystr2,so thas legit? lol
24-08-2018T16:27:56,SageSaga,it's real
24-08-2018T16:28:09,Bgrmystr2,jeez
24-08-2018T16:28:29,Bgrmystr2,how does she breathe?
24-08-2018T16:28:35,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s what sports bras can do
24-08-2018T16:28:48,SageSaga,in and out?
24-08-2018T16:29:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"My search wasn’t pulling that up, and I believe that is a picture of Jenna Marbles"
24-08-2018T16:29:19,SageSaga,"breasts are just skin, fatty tissue and glandular tissues"
24-08-2018T16:29:30,Bgrmystr2,"lol with that much weight pushing into your chest, you can only do so much before I suspect it would start putting pressure on your wind pipe. :u"
24-08-2018T16:29:39,Rosscoe,THey just get the fat shoved around
24-08-2018T16:29:44,SpazztasticKiwi,So guys fall in love with skin sacks of fatty tissues
24-08-2018T16:29:58,sunblaze,not wrong sage but that totally sounded unsexy sage...
24-08-2018T16:30:02,Rosscoe,Peter Griffin Did
24-08-2018T16:30:04,Bgrmystr2,"people love things they don't have, Kiwi"
24-08-2018T16:30:06,Bgrmystr2,it's the unknown
24-08-2018T16:30:21,Bgrmystr2,boobs just fall into that.
24-08-2018T16:31:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"I know. And they have their good points, it just knowing the full truth..."
24-08-2018T16:31:13,SageSaga,i love boobs because they are really fun to draw
24-08-2018T16:31:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I gotta go back in but I’ll be back for lunch
24-08-2018T16:31:49,Rosscoe,Boobs are fun to draw.
24-08-2018T16:31:58,Rosscoe,3D sculpting on the other hand is abit of a chose
24-08-2018T16:32:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Moral of story: boobs are fun with a cost
24-08-2018T16:32:00,Rosscoe,chore*
24-08-2018T16:32:11,SpazztasticKiwi,👋🏻
24-08-2018T16:32:23,SageSaga,Drawings cant feel back pain unless you make them
24-08-2018T16:33:05,SageSaga,Toyoko in Yosh has massive tits- but she is an android with a spine made out of titanium and carbon nanotubes- shes fine
24-08-2018T16:36:15,Rosscoe,Yarp
24-08-2018T16:36:53,Bgrmystr2,"also, her boobs are probably really light compared to normal boobs.. and even if they were heavier, her spine makes it irrelevant anyway"
24-08-2018T16:37:21,SageSaga,same weight
24-08-2018T16:38:41,Bgrmystr2,hm okay
24-08-2018T16:39:17,SageSaga,cant have someone grabbing android boobies just to find out if they are real people or not
24-08-2018T16:39:44,SageSaga,"""haha! I knew it! An android!"""
24-08-2018T16:40:03,Rosscoe,Either way pillows to lay ones head on ;3
24-08-2018T16:40:22,SageSaga,=_= boobs dont make good pillows
24-08-2018T16:41:01,Rosscoe,Depends on which way your laying on them
24-08-2018T16:41:16,SageSaga,not for the woman
24-08-2018T16:42:35,Rosscoe,Sadly no
24-08-2018T16:42:51,Rosscoe,It can be abit painful
24-08-2018T16:42:57,Rosscoe,Thats why I do so in brief moments
24-08-2018T16:46:35,SageSaga,almost done
24-08-2018T16:47:46,Bgrmystr2,..I just realized why it's been so damn quiet since I woke up
24-08-2018T16:49:25,Bgrmystr2,guess there's always next time :/
24-08-2018T16:49:33,SageSaga,?
24-08-2018T16:50:27,Bgrmystr2,"Oh, I just realized the music was off"
24-08-2018T16:50:31,Bgrmystr2,since I woke up
24-08-2018T16:50:54,SageSaga,my music isnt playing?
24-08-2018T16:51:11,Bgrmystr2,"no no, you're fine"
24-08-2018T16:51:20,Bgrmystr2,I just didn't realize the stream was on mute
24-08-2018T16:51:22,SageSaga,you just had your audio muted
24-08-2018T16:51:23,SageSaga,ok
24-08-2018T16:51:29,Bgrmystr2,well it starts muted
24-08-2018T16:51:42,Bgrmystr2,picarto's got some dumb default shit goin on with the mute button
24-08-2018T16:52:49,SageSaga,pretty sure it defaults to your last action of muting or unmuting
24-08-2018T16:52:57,Bgrmystr2,it doesn't.
24-08-2018T16:53:13,Bgrmystr2,cuz I have to unmute your stream and tom's stream every single time you guys stream.
24-08-2018T16:53:17,Bgrmystr2,even fluff's stream too
24-08-2018T16:53:22,Bgrmystr2,every single time.
24-08-2018T16:53:45,SageSaga,that's odd because what it does for me is- if i unmute some other stream - when i come back i have to remember to mute my own stream
24-08-2018T16:54:12,Bgrmystr2,I haven't had it remember my preference since.. oh god.. earlu 2017?
24-08-2018T16:54:23,Bgrmystr2,maybe late 2016?
24-08-2018T16:54:28,Bgrmystr2,it hasn't done this shit for years
24-08-2018T17:04:28,Rosscoe,Its either gona get better or worse from here
24-08-2018T17:04:49,SageSaga,eh?
24-08-2018T17:09:10,Rosscoe,Picarto
24-08-2018T17:09:49,sunblaze,so far it got some things good and a lot bad
24-08-2018T17:09:50,SageSaga,"yeah but that's like saying ""It's going to be either hot or cold today"""
24-08-2018T17:09:56,sunblaze,not convinced so far
24-08-2018T17:11:43,SageSaga,Twitch doesnt allow NSFW at all- so anything i do that they think might be NSFW could throw me off that platform- even drawing a character naked with no details while i figure out the clothes may violate their TOS
24-08-2018T17:12:04,Rosscoe,They are twitchy
24-08-2018T17:12:19,Rosscoe,"There is a mature option but thats mainly for ""mild hard language"""
24-08-2018T17:13:32,SageSaga,a lot of my friends do adult content so if im going to be on a platform to stream with them- my only option is Picarto
24-08-2018T17:16:04,Rosscoe,yarp
24-08-2018T17:16:44,Rosscoe,"I gang much CSP and ZBRUSH knowledge from alot of artists, and sadly its adult work, but eh"
24-08-2018T17:17:15,Bgrmystr2,what's sad about adult work? :thinking:
24-08-2018T17:17:21,SageSaga,i dunno
24-08-2018T17:18:12,SageSaga,all done
24-08-2018T17:19:26,Rosscoe,Very crisp Sage!
24-08-2018T17:19:47,Bgrmystr2,lookin nice
24-08-2018T17:20:03,Rosscoe,Sad part being is thats alot of what goes on in order to sell art to make a liviing for many Bgr :ptv-sad:
24-08-2018T17:21:00,Bgrmystr2,"you don't have to sell adult art to make a living, but it does make it a lot easier"
24-08-2018T17:21:09,Bgrmystr2,I don't think it's a sad thing though
24-08-2018T17:21:16,Bgrmystr2,there's nothin wrong with sellin adult art :u
24-08-2018T17:21:35,SageSaga,i might have to start doing adult art to make a living =_=
24-08-2018T17:22:32,Bgrmystr2,:/
24-08-2018T17:23:10,Bgrmystr2,"if anything, it'd help you get noticed way more"
24-08-2018T17:23:10,BadFoMo,Hi.
24-08-2018T17:23:15,Bgrmystr2,hey fomo
24-08-2018T17:23:15,SageSaga,i would prefer enough people enjoy AI enough to send me money and buy merch-
24-08-2018T17:23:23,SageSaga,but i cant afford to make Merch
24-08-2018T17:23:34,SageSaga,and there's this huge outcry against preorders
24-08-2018T17:24:00,BadFoMo,Cheat and put Furries in the comic?
24-08-2018T17:24:01,SageSaga,"and im like ""Sure- people like EA can afford to not do Preorders- but i need that money to pay for the stuff to begin with!"""
24-08-2018T17:24:12,SageSaga,Is Nyna not furry enough?
24-08-2018T17:24:27,SageSaga,i will have werewolves- do they count?
24-08-2018T17:24:34,BadFoMo,Maybe?
24-08-2018T17:25:47,Bgrmystr2,"Nyna isn't furry though, she's just like.. cat ears, tail etc"
24-08-2018T17:25:49,Bgrmystr2,xD
24-08-2018T17:25:57,SageSaga,arms - legs
24-08-2018T17:26:45,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah that makes her what, 30%? maybe?"
24-08-2018T17:26:49,Bgrmystr2,35%?
24-08-2018T17:26:51,Bgrmystr2,xD

24-08-2018T17:27:18,Bgrmystr2,xD No Fomo
24-08-2018T17:27:26,SageSaga,"""/godmode 1"""
24-08-2018T17:27:32,Bgrmystr2,lolol
24-08-2018T17:27:41,SageSaga,later folks take care!
24-08-2018T17:27:48,Bgrmystr2,enabling the administrative command console doesn't automatically mean cheats are enabled lol
24-08-2018T17:27:53,BadFoMo,Alamode?
24-08-2018T17:28:05,Bgrmystr2,"thanks for streamin, Sage :D"
24-08-2018T17:28:54,Rosscoe,Night Sage!
24-08-2018T17:29:25,Sammit,Thanks for the stream Sage
24-08-2018T17:47:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder what kind of merch is cheapest
24-08-2018T18:10:32,Twokinds,loot boxes. Even the box doesn't cost anything because it isn't real.
24-08-2018T18:11:40,BluePhantom90,hmm
24-08-2018T18:11:44,Twokinds,Holy crap
24-08-2018T18:11:47,BluePhantom90,Hey Tom
24-08-2018T18:12:00,Twokinds,The color vote is currently ridiculous
24-08-2018T18:12:19,BluePhantom90,lol I take the Snep one is getting a lot of votes
24-08-2018T18:12:23,Twokinds,"It's 1 sketch in first, and then an 8 WAY TIE for second."
24-08-2018T18:12:35,BluePhantom90,lol
24-08-2018T18:13:11,Twokinds,"Oh, wait, someone just voted and broke the tie. Now it's just a 7 way tie for 3rd"
24-08-2018T18:13:52,BluePhantom90,Btw tom wondering if I could pick your brain more about Twokinds.
24-08-2018T18:14:33,Bgrmystr2,odamn tom
24-08-2018T18:15:48,BluePhantom90,Well Wondering Tom You said if Tigers get a white tiger its like getting a shiny. Would the Tigers treat the family different when they had a white tiger child?
24-08-2018T18:16:19,Twokinds,Sure
24-08-2018T18:17:02,BluePhantom90,Well how would the Couple with the white tiger child be treated if I could ask?
24-08-2018T18:20:36,Twokinds,elevated in status
24-08-2018T18:21:02,BluePhantom90,Basically hope they have more white tiger children
24-08-2018T18:24:39,BluePhantom90,Anyways. Do western Basitin's have allies that fight along side of them if they were to fight the Eastern Basitin's?
24-08-2018T18:32:55,Twokinds,no
24-08-2018T18:36:15,BluePhantom90,So the western Basitin's are able to handle the Eastern Basitin's while they have more weapons and armor?
24-08-2018T18:37:09,Twokinds,Westerners have weapons and numbers to match the east.
24-08-2018T18:39:00,BadFoMo,What kind of creachers and monsters (the type that would attack a player in an open world game) are there in TwoKinds; if any?
24-08-2018T18:39:01,BluePhantom90,but the Eastern has armor. And western seems like they have more tribal weapons. I could see them having a obsidian sword
24-08-2018T18:40:02,Twokinds,They're not any less technologically advance.
24-08-2018T18:41:27,BluePhantom90,hmmm
24-08-2018T18:42:40,Twokinds,The three girls Carver ran into are civilians.
24-08-2018T18:42:59,BluePhantom90,ah So they have soldier types as well
24-08-2018T18:43:44,Twokinds,Of course.
24-08-2018T18:43:59,BadFoMo,I was thinking that the Western Basitins (the ones on the East side) were stelthy where as you can hear and see an Easern Basitin (West side) coming from a ways away.
24-08-2018T18:45:01,Twokinds,"I mean, it's like looking at some random locals hanging out in Hawaii and assuming the US military all wears Hawaiian shirts to battle XD"
24-08-2018T18:45:03,BluePhantom90,Also Tom a question what do you think of this idea from Heresy of Western Basitin Spa? https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/203154818930442242/482052230896418816/2018-08-22_Natani_and_Adelaide_vines_01.jpg
24-08-2018T18:46:10,Bgrmystr2,there's probably nothing like that.
24-08-2018T18:46:32,BluePhantom90,well there was this comic Tom did https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/197888855435640833/483034949016879124/tentacles_of_inappropriateness_by_twokinds-d3cnaic.jpg
24-08-2018T18:46:36,BadFoMo,I think this is a loaded question.
24-08-2018T18:47:02,Bgrmystr2,"the two are extremely different, Blue"
24-08-2018T18:47:45,Bgrmystr2,"also, tom should probably be at D&D by now, or at least soon..?"
24-08-2018T18:47:54,BluePhantom90,I know just wonder what Tom Thinks. He had some good funny idea's as well. Wonder if the Western spa would be a good laugh
24-08-2018T18:48:38,SageSaga,"Tom, these new PCs are so quiet- if they didnt have all this fancy RGB you wouldnt even know they were on"
24-08-2018T18:51:08,BadFoMo,drops peble into Sage's computer's fan.
24-08-2018T18:52:28,SpazztasticKiwi,denies seeing murder of BadFoMo to officer
24-08-2018T18:52:48,BluePhantom90,soooo
24-08-2018T18:53:16,BadFoMo,Yoooo?
24-08-2018T18:55:08,BluePhantom90,another good Question. Tom since the Snep's homes were destroyed where did they go to live? I figure up in the mountains or merged with the some Tiger caravans.
24-08-2018T18:55:26,SpazztasticKiwi,And my vote’s in so maybe that’ll work some stuff out
24-08-2018T18:56:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Sage have you ever heard of cold sweet Thai chicken?
24-08-2018T18:56:36,Twokinds,Jeez Blue
24-08-2018T18:57:11,BluePhantom90,What you said before their homes were destoryed.
24-08-2018T18:57:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I think the translation is: hakuna your ta tas
24-08-2018T18:57:48,Twokinds,"I have said before, their home was not destroyed, it was lost."
24-08-2018T18:58:37,BluePhantom90,oh right. -scribles- well were would they have gone too?
24-08-2018T18:58:54,Twokinds,I don't know
24-08-2018T18:59:38,Twokinds,I didn't write anything about snow leopards.
24-08-2018T19:00:24,BluePhantom90,ah so can be up in the air. Or fun side story idea's... for fan fics I guess
24-08-2018T19:02:37,BluePhantom90,until you put the story of the sneps in stone
24-08-2018T19:07:46,Twokinds,That's it - their village was turned to stone.
24-08-2018T19:07:57,BluePhantom90,lol
24-08-2018T19:08:22,SpazztasticKiwi,What kind of stone? :ptv-condescending:
24-08-2018T19:08:42,SpazztasticKiwi,(Sorry)
24-08-2018T19:08:44,BluePhantom90,Will we see more Cameo's of you Tom in Twokinds?
24-08-2018T19:08:57,ferociousfox,^
24-08-2018T19:09:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Isn’t he technically always there since he’s drawing every line
24-08-2018T19:10:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Talk about “woven into the story”
24-08-2018T19:11:05,BluePhantom90,"Oh I don't I figure it would be funny of a Sketch of the mask's arguing with Tom being the God saying ""You three better not fight over there or I will take the Earth away from you for a momth!"""
24-08-2018T19:11:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel that’d be more of a side sketch
24-08-2018T19:11:48,SpazztasticKiwi,And it wouldn’t make much sense
24-08-2018T19:11:49,BluePhantom90,joke Sketch
24-08-2018T19:12:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"Try suggesting it and see, but idk"
24-08-2018T19:12:41,BluePhantom90,-shrugs-
24-08-2018T19:13:58,ferociousfox,The fidget doodle from a few streams ago got me into the game. I've only played for a couple of hours but its pretty fun
24-08-2018T19:14:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I liked the overwatch sketches
24-08-2018T19:16:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’m a Mercy fan, but I’m waiting for a D.VA. nod"
24-08-2018T19:16:09,BluePhantom90,I don't remember any overwatch ones.
24-08-2018T19:22:39,SpazztasticKiwi,And the derp sketches are 👌🏻 too
24-08-2018T19:23:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Pretty sure Flora was put in Mercy’s witch skin awhile back
24-08-2018T19:23:49,BadFoMo,"I don't play Overwatch, but wasn't that Nibbly?"
24-08-2018T19:24:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"Point is, somebody was"
24-08-2018T19:25:32,SpazztasticKiwi,And there’s one I remember seeing that looked like a Symmettra skin
24-08-2018T19:25:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Pretty sure that’s misspelled but oh well
24-08-2018T19:44:48,unsteddyphoenix,I think...that was also Nibbly
24-08-2018T19:46:56,TheFDdriver,hello
24-08-2018T19:47:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn’t say who had Symmetra’s skin
24-08-2018T19:47:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Just that I remember seeing it
24-08-2018T19:48:01,BluePhantom90,darn I had a list of Questions for tom (not writen down of course) and now forgot what I wanted to ask.
24-08-2018T19:48:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"But in any case, it’s nice to see them. On the subject of another game, I could see a Reaper Leviathan running from Nibbly"
24-08-2018T19:48:51,SpazztasticKiwi,“The eyes! The eyes!”
24-08-2018T19:49:34,SpazztasticKiwi,The problem being drawing and actual Reaper as well as the copyright issue
24-08-2018T19:49:40,SpazztasticKiwi,*an
24-08-2018T19:50:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"But I’m back to work, so byeeeeee ✌🏻"
24-08-2018T19:50:51,BluePhantom90,lol A good sketch idea. Keith and Nat pilot a FranXX from the anime DARLING.
24-08-2018T19:51:15,BluePhantom90,Keith in the female side while Nat is doing the piloting
24-08-2018T19:56:52,Bgrmystr2,why would keith be in the female seat though..?
24-08-2018T19:57:43,BluePhantom90,Keith is always in the female clothing. Plus Nat would kick Keiths ass for getting in the female spot
24-08-2018T19:58:11,Bgrmystr2,not really? .. on both counts?
24-08-2018T19:58:29,Bgrmystr2,I really don't know how you see them lol
24-08-2018T20:00:05,BluePhantom90,Okay look at the position The female is in the Franxx and tell me Nat would be alright being there. I can mention a spoiler but wont if none of you saw the anime
24-08-2018T20:02:02,Bgrmystr2,I saw it all the way and I'm just not seeing it. She probably wouldn't get into the thing to begin with.
24-08-2018T20:02:13,Bgrmystr2,she'd nope.
24-08-2018T20:02:38,BluePhantom90,well as long as Keith is in the female spot I think she would be alright with it
24-08-2018T20:05:48,BluePhantom90,I mean Nat is being more alright with her Female self. I can see she would be happy to be with Keith.
24-08-2018T20:07:11,Bgrmystr2,"&gt; Nat being more alright with her feminine side.. yet would rather not take the female seat? That logic contradicts the idea, just sayin"
24-08-2018T20:08:19,BluePhantom90,NO the male seat
24-08-2018T20:08:35,BluePhantom90,"I said Keith the female seat, Nat in the Male seat"
24-08-2018T20:11:07,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah.... I know, and that changes nothing about what I said. :ptv-wondering:"
24-08-2018T20:13:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"I was washing my hands in the ladies room, and a guy walked in"
24-08-2018T20:14:04,SpazztasticKiwi,He looked at me and asks “is this is the ladies room?”
24-08-2018T20:14:10,SpazztasticKiwi,#noshit
24-08-2018T20:14:29,BluePhantom90,lol
24-08-2018T20:14:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"Unless I missed something and got Norafied in the last thirty seconds, yes"
24-08-2018T20:16:11,BluePhantom90,alright
24-08-2018T20:17:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"Anyway, that is all. Thought it was interesting to say the least. Bye again"
24-08-2018T20:19:10,Bgrmystr2,o-okay.. bye kiwi
24-08-2018T20:31:40,BluePhantom90,soooo

24-08-2018T21:23:17,ferociousfox,"haha, my friends are celebrating"
24-08-2018T21:23:23,ferociousfox,i find it morbid
24-08-2018T21:24:30,ferociousfox,it is sad though
24-08-2018T21:24:48,BluePhantom90,He was kinda of a ass. r-r I wont hate him too much. Fellow soldier but hes seemed like a traitor often
24-08-2018T21:24:59,ferociousfox,"I never liked him,"
24-08-2018T21:25:07,ferociousfox,gotta respect though
24-08-2018T21:25:14,Venin,holo
24-08-2018T21:25:14,BluePhantom90,same
24-08-2018T21:25:53,ferociousfox,My classes dont start until late september &gt;-&lt;
24-08-2018T21:26:07,ferociousfox,i cant wait
24-08-2018T21:26:47,Dadrobit,":/ I didn't always agree with all of his political leanings, but he was a fine man overall. Makes me dream of the politics of only a decade ago."
24-08-2018T21:27:08,Dadrobit,"When asked about Obama in 08 - ""No ma'am. He's a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues."""
24-08-2018T21:27:17,ferociousfox,thats good
24-08-2018T21:27:28,ferociousfox,shows he has some respect for others.
24-08-2018T21:27:34,Dadrobit,Fucking civil arguments for the position in the Oval Office.
24-08-2018T21:27:39,Dadrobit,Who'd a thunk it.
24-08-2018T21:27:41,ferociousfox,his political opponents at least
24-08-2018T21:28:49,ferociousfox,he did have unbridled contempt for the vietnamese though
24-08-2018T21:28:53,BluePhantom90,yeah they kept using emotions in politics. If you use emotions and not logic you could lead yourself to a terrible path
24-08-2018T21:29:50,ferociousfox,depends what you mean by emotions
24-08-2018T21:30:32,Dadrobit,It's almost like he was tortured for 5 and a half years in a Vietnamese POW camp.
24-08-2018T21:30:38,ferociousfox,i know
24-08-2018T21:30:55,ferociousfox,so he gets a partial pass
24-08-2018T21:31:20,BluePhantom90,"If you dislike Obama you were a racist, if you hated his Healthcare plan you want ill people to die. That kind of Emotional politics"
24-08-2018T21:31:51,ferociousfox,"isnt that logical fallacy, like slippery slope or somethin"
24-08-2018T21:32:42,Dadrobit,Somewere between slippery slope and a strawman. Just mudlinging.
24-08-2018T21:32:46,Dadrobit,mudslinging*
24-08-2018T21:33:54,BluePhantom90,"in a way yes. That is what every political advertisement is now calling Trump Hilter, which they can not say a single thing Trump has done similar of the evil deeds of Hitler."
24-08-2018T21:34:10,Venin,*is in a fetal position because he does undertand anyhing* ;~;
24-08-2018T21:34:49,ferociousfox,"When it comes to politics, I don't like to talk much because so many people refuse to listen. In short, the leaders of the world need to have more sympathy/compassion imo"
24-08-2018T21:34:55,ferociousfox,it would go a long way
24-08-2018T21:36:22,BluePhantom90,In a way yes. But as of now we have a leader that was thrown into a Hierarchy that don't like outsiders in their system. So they will do what ever they can to destroy him
24-08-2018T21:39:21,BluePhantom90,"but we will see how this system handles a full term of him lol. But we do have a lot of issues in the world, the problem is the world was left without a leader to guide it. Which seems to have been walking into chaos for a while"
24-08-2018T21:43:22,ferociousfox,"lmao idk what to say, i just want everyone to be happy, and to be happy to help others"
24-08-2018T21:44:17,BluePhantom90,Well its kinda hard with everyone at each others throats because of racial politics.
24-08-2018T21:44:53,ferociousfox,itll take time
24-08-2018T21:44:57,ferociousfox,and change
24-08-2018T21:45:10,ferociousfox,but I think it will happen one day
24-08-2018T21:46:06,BluePhantom90,lol You do know people that are told logic that destroys their thinking can cause the person pain
24-08-2018T21:49:34,ferociousfox,I don't understand what you said. whos causing pain
24-08-2018T21:50:19,BluePhantom90,If you bring logic that counters the other person's logic of thinking. You can cause that person pain.
24-08-2018T21:50:50,ferociousfox,"yeah, thats sad but true"
24-08-2018T21:51:14,ferociousfox,just gotta be open minded and accept that other people think differently
24-08-2018T21:52:18,BluePhantom90,"Well to us it might be easy. BUT to those brained washed and closed minded, that think they are open minded. We might have to cause logical pain to get though to them"
24-08-2018T21:55:02,ferociousfox,but what do you mean by logical pain
24-08-2018T21:56:22,ferociousfox,It's not like were gonna show them theyre wrong
24-08-2018T21:56:28,ferociousfox,we could be wrong after all
24-08-2018T21:57:20,BluePhantom90,"hmm well sometimes to get them from the path of hate, we have to break their logical belief."
24-08-2018T21:59:38,ferociousfox,"well, good talking to ya. Gotta grab some dinner. see you sunday"
24-08-2018T22:00:27,BluePhantom90,lol not trying to be mean
24-08-2018T22:00:49,ferociousfox,no you werent being mean
24-08-2018T22:01:04,ferociousfox,I really did enjoy talking
24-08-2018T22:01:23,BluePhantom90,thus it why its nice to talk to another open minded person
24-08-2018T22:01:42,ferociousfox,haha

24-08-2018T23:25:18,Bgrmystr2,it's probably from you booping the cat when you feed it.
24-08-2018T23:25:24,Bgrmystr2,cuz cats learn that kinda stuff
24-08-2018T23:25:27,Bgrmystr2,and emulate it

24-08-2018T23:26:08,Ordithus,Molly (one of my cats growing up) would lie on her back and boop me
