05-02-2018T15:52:58,TheBeckoner,"Get naked and drink aloe vera while lamenting the death of a harmonica your dog ate while you were away at school in third grade, and just hope for rain. It'll happen."

05-02-2018T17:04:04,JaydenMozingo,Oooh. That's a 'neat' backside you have Natani
05-02-2018T17:04:14,wolfspartan1,lol
05-02-2018T17:05:03,JaydenMozingo,Does anyone know a way to go to sleep and 'Control' what you first dream about
05-02-2018T17:05:20,wolfspartan1,uhh
05-02-2018T17:05:39,wolfspartan1,is that even possible?
05-02-2018T17:05:42,JaydenMozingo,"People say that if you think about what you what to dream about, you'll dream about it"
05-02-2018T17:06:10,JaydenMozingo,I've done it before. I just have not been able to do it again after
05-02-2018T17:08:14,wolfspartan1,huh cool lol
05-02-2018T17:08:34,JaydenMozingo,I wanted to know because I've been trying to dream about being in the world of Twokinds:joy_cat:
05-02-2018T17:11:31,wolfspartan1,good luck on that
05-02-2018T18:01:43,Dadrobit,"It's called lucid dreaming and it's very possible with practice. I used to do it myself, but stopped after a couple of nasty nightmares."
05-02-2018T18:01:57,Dadrobit,Shit's not fun when it goes bad.
05-02-2018T18:06:53,JaydenMozingo,"lol. hmm...how exactly does one, 'practice' that?"
05-02-2018T18:07:19,Bgrmystr2,"yeah that's the thing that noone seems to agree on, Jay"
05-02-2018T18:07:33,Bgrmystr2,"and I've never seen anyone come forth with proof other than ""It works cuz I said so"""
05-02-2018T18:07:59,TheBeckoner,Its less practice and more learning how to induce them.
05-02-2018T18:08:00,TheBeckoner,From what I gather.
05-02-2018T18:08:04,Bgrmystr2,it's not something that can be proven nor disproven/
05-02-2018T18:08:14,Bgrmystr2,it can also be made up on the spot
05-02-2018T18:09:05,Bgrmystr2,"I want to believe it possible, but every time I hear about it, it always sounds like some on-the-spot made up bs"
05-02-2018T18:09:27,JaydenMozingo,"so, is it just a matter of weather a person can do it or not based on if they think they think they can?"
05-02-2018T18:10:23,Bgrmystr2,"people tell good stories, but it's easy to tell when someone's recounting the events of something they've actually seen versus making something up at that moment thinking it would sound cool"
05-02-2018T18:10:36,Bgrmystr2,there's a lack of emotional telling
05-02-2018T18:10:58,JaydenMozingo,hmm
05-02-2018T18:11:14,Dadrobit,Are you telling me that you think people like on the internet?
05-02-2018T18:11:20,Dadrobit,Lie*
05-02-2018T18:11:32,Bgrmystr2,"Maybe dadro. I think people lie in real life, too."
05-02-2018T18:11:36,Bgrmystr2,"to my face, at that."
05-02-2018T18:11:48,Dadrobit,"And for me, the catalyst was meditation."
05-02-2018T18:12:33,Dadrobit,But waking up from a lucid nightmare into sleep paralysis made me stop practicing.
05-02-2018T18:12:47,Dadrobit,It's actually the worst possible thing.
05-02-2018T18:13:15,Bgrmystr2,"probably should have changed it then, if it was completely lucid"
05-02-2018T18:13:25,Bgrmystr2,considering that implies you have control over the dream
05-02-2018T18:13:31,Bgrmystr2,"if you don't, it's not lucid"
05-02-2018T18:13:42,Bgrmystr2,"and just a normal dream, or in that case, nightmare"
05-02-2018T18:14:59,Dadrobit,"I was concious and in control of my self, but not in total control. There are different levels here."
05-02-2018T18:15:20,Bgrmystr2,sounds like a normal dream to me lol
05-02-2018T18:15:48,Dadrobit,You have to experience it I think to really understand it.
05-02-2018T18:16:34,Bgrmystr2,it's not exactly diffcult to understand. Lucid implies you control the dream. It's the difference between watching a movie and being a character IN the movie.
05-02-2018T18:16:39,Dadrobit,It's a matter of in the moment agency
05-02-2018T18:17:25,Bgrmystr2,"there's lots of webcomics, anime, and other shows that go into that kind of thing."
05-02-2018T18:17:49,Dadrobit,"And sometimes as an actor, you have influence on the director, but sometimes you're just the actor. Regular dreams are just watching it after the fact."
05-02-2018T18:18:19,Dadrobit,Different levels of influence.
05-02-2018T18:18:54,Dadrobit,It's not a black and white hing.
05-02-2018T18:19:01,Dadrobit,Thing*
05-02-2018T18:29:00,JaydenMozingo,has temporarily left the conversation due to dinner reasons and will return shortly.
05-02-2018T18:29:13,wolfspartan1,lol cya jay
05-02-2018T18:35:01,JaydenMozingo,has returned and has a numb left leg from 'slapping' to much.
05-02-2018T18:35:33,wolfspartan1,wb
05-02-2018T18:37:02,JaydenMozingo,"So, isn't sleep paralysis when you wake up temporarily paralized?"
05-02-2018T18:37:39,JaydenMozingo,From a lucid dream?
05-02-2018T19:03:14,JaydenMozingo,I think he problem with me almost never drawing even digitally is that I don't know what to draw.
05-02-2018T19:04:50,wolfspartan1,look up guides
05-02-2018T19:08:00,wolfspartan1,you should see the morrowind house i drew in paint x3
05-02-2018T19:09:16,Dadrobit,Sleep paralysis is a natural paralysis that your body induces to itself whenever you're asleep.
05-02-2018T19:10:01,Dadrobit,You just don't realize it happens most of the time because the act of waking up normally undoes it.
05-02-2018T19:11:11,Dadrobit,"But the nightmares I was experiencing, and forcing myself to wake up from left me in that condition even after I was totally awake."
05-02-2018T19:12:52,Dadrobit,"Normal stuff like breathing isn't affected, but you can't do anything else but that and blinking."
05-02-2018T19:13:18,Dadrobit,"Like, trying to breathe on purpose, like take a deep breath, is impossible."
05-02-2018T19:14:54,Dadrobit,"Its a very panic inducing situation by itself, and having it happen after a lucid nightmare is... Well, the stuff of nightmares."
05-02-2018T19:16:28,JaydenMozingo,"woah. So you experience what you do when you're asleep, as you're awake..."
05-02-2018T19:17:12,JaydenMozingo,I've had dreams where I knew what was happening around me while sleeping but not that.
05-02-2018T19:18:18,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it happens mostly to folks with sleep conditions. My father for instance has sleep apnea and wakes up with paralysis all the time."
05-02-2018T19:18:35,JaydenMozingo,how does it wear off though?
05-02-2018T19:18:57,Dadrobit,Nothing you can do but wait for a minute or two.
05-02-2018T19:19:27,Dadrobit,Doesn't help that it feels like eternity in the moment though.
05-02-2018T19:19:43,JaydenMozingo,so it wears off through a short period of time
05-02-2018T19:19:48,JaydenMozingo,hmm
05-02-2018T19:20:20,Dadrobit,"Like my dad, he's gone through it countless times, but he still panics when it happens."
05-02-2018T19:20:46,JaydenMozingo,I almost want it to happen to me just to see what it feels like. But I'm not hoping
05-02-2018T19:21:39,Dadrobit,"From what mom tells me, he tries to break it by screaming, but it only comes out as a choking gurgle until it wears off and he's able to actually scream."
05-02-2018T19:22:29,Dadrobit,It's not fun man. It's really actually the worst.
05-02-2018T19:22:47,JaydenMozingo,I can imagine
05-02-2018T19:22:54,JaydenMozingo,"acually,"
05-02-2018T19:23:57,JaydenMozingo,"weird as it sounds, I had a dream of that once, in the dream, I couldn't move, scream, or talk. Just blink"
05-02-2018T19:24:02,JaydenMozingo,and breath
05-02-2018T19:24:55,JaydenMozingo,*breathe
05-02-2018T19:26:44,JaydenMozingo,have you ever had a dream where could Feel Everything that happens to you as if it were real?
05-02-2018T19:27:47,JaydenMozingo,(forgot to add 'you' between where and feel)
05-02-2018T19:29:22,Dadrobit,"Yeah, that's the entire premise of lucid dreaming, the transition from just remembering a dream, to experiencing it, and potentially even controlling it."
05-02-2018T19:31:23,Dadrobit,"Spent half a year practicing, stopped after a pair of nightmares and paralysis events."
05-02-2018T19:31:55,JaydenMozingo,"So, I love planes, always wanted to fly myself. Every time I'm about to fly (even with a magic of some kind), I always wake up right before flight, aka the best part of the dream."
05-02-2018T19:32:12,JaydenMozingo,Why is that?
05-02-2018T19:33:06,Dadrobit,Dunno. Maybe because you realize you're dreaming and can't hold on to it?
05-02-2018T19:33:15,JaydenMozingo,Because I've flown in a WWII fighter before. But I still have dreams where I can't
05-02-2018T19:33:28,JaydenMozingo,I guess so
05-02-2018T19:34:48,JaydenMozingo,Whats funny is that I have terrifying dreams. I've had dreams of jumping from the WTC on 9/11 before
05-02-2018T19:35:34,JaydenMozingo,"But I'm fearless, as I'm falling, I think, ""this is how it ends, I knew this. It was going to happen."""
05-02-2018T19:36:09,TheFDdriver,"wow, thats crazy"
05-02-2018T19:36:57,wolfspartan1,ello fd
05-02-2018T19:37:04,JaydenMozingo,I'm 14 yrs old and I don't even know what they look like from inside. Yet I was inside for about 30 minutes dream time
05-02-2018T19:37:18,JaydenMozingo,until I jumped
05-02-2018T19:37:28,TheFDdriver,hey

05-02-2018T19:40:00,wolfspartan1,ello jay
05-02-2018T20:48:04,JaydenMozingo,Do you guys have any tips or even a website to go to with good drawing ideas? I'm still in learning with 'ok' art skills
05-02-2018T20:48:12,JaydenMozingo,But lack ideas
05-02-2018T20:48:26,wolfspartan1,i don't have any sorry
05-02-2018T20:50:21,TheFDdriver,i wish i had
05-02-2018T20:57:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"I do a lot of stylized, black & white line work and lettering. It’s good practice for drawing straight lines"
05-02-2018T21:14:54,Edinku,"Jayden, I don't there is such website but sites like Pinterest, Tumblr, Flickr, etc are good sites for references and inspiration."
05-02-2018T21:15:02,Edinku,i don't think there*
05-02-2018T21:19:05,JaydenMozingo,"I don't mean what to draw, sorry, I mean what to draw character wise"
05-02-2018T21:19:13,JaydenMozingo,poses I can't think of
05-02-2018T21:19:23,JaydenMozingo,A funny moment I can't think of
05-02-2018T21:23:57,Edinku,"Try looking for movie/anime screencaps, they may provide situations or poses you can try off. Also, many shonen mangas provided a lot of dynamic poses and situations that you can draw and get inspire of :)!"
05-02-2018T21:24:15,JaydenMozingo,oh
05-02-2018T21:24:43,JaydenMozingo,Thanks :smile_cat:
