23-12-2018T22:58:27,Dadrobit,"Went shopping at WalMart last night. Got my list done pretty quick, but the lines were ridiculous. Only 4 registers were open and there were no self serve. The lines to check out went around the front of the store. Waited in line for an hour. It was rough"
23-12-2018T22:58:54,Dadrobit,11pm was when I got in line. I got to my car at 12:15am.
23-12-2018T22:59:57,Dadrobit,The local mart legitimately had more lines open that WalMart. Someone fucked up scheduling cashiers royally.

23-12-2018T23:08:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Our Walmart closed at 6. Yours is keeping at 24 hours?
23-12-2018T23:08:42,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs Christmas
23-12-2018T23:09:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Wait. Is your last night my last night or are times zones closer
23-12-2018T23:10:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Though they likely scheduled few cashiers like that to keep lines localized for easier shoplifter spotting
