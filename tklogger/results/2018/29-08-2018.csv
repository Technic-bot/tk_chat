29-08-2018T00:06:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm all for delivery for convenience and saving time but I feel it‚Äôs for your lack of socialness
29-08-2018T00:08:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Though we don‚Äôt have delivery around here unless you count Amazon or the mail so
29-08-2018T00:08:36,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-wink: Eh same thing
29-08-2018T00:09:42,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs also go to do with me ‚ÄúI can get it myself‚Äù stubbornness
29-08-2018T00:10:39,unsteddyphoenix,I personally dont feel the need to prove I can locate a burrito myself
29-08-2018T00:10:55,unsteddyphoenix,Im secure in that particular skill
29-08-2018T00:11:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"It also has to do with laziness. If you can have it delivered, you‚Äôre more likely to buy it and thus buy it more and more. Saves money to be stubborn like I am"
29-08-2018T00:12:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Of course there‚Äôs those who just can take ten extra minutes to go get it themselves and it‚Äôs useful for them
29-08-2018T00:12:27,SpazztasticKiwi,*cant
29-08-2018T00:14:13,Mippy,Yeah...considering I live in the suburbs and can't drive dilivery is great. The only place that dilivers burritos is on the other side of the city from my subdivision
29-08-2018T00:14:31,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs always pizza
29-08-2018T00:14:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Among whatever else gets delivered these days
29-08-2018T00:14:56,Mippy,Pizza can be found right up the road
29-08-2018T00:15:00,Ordithus,Lasagna

29-08-2018T00:15:59,Mippy,Calamari
29-08-2018T00:16:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Any coffee place around here isn‚Äôt really worth it though

29-08-2018T00:16:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Sushi can be delivery right
29-08-2018T00:16:44,Ordithus,Probably.  Haven't tried
29-08-2018T00:17:13,Mippy,I think my brother had sushi deliverd once :ptv-wondering:
29-08-2018T00:18:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt go out enough to figure out what all does and has what
29-08-2018T00:18:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I swing wildly from being reasonably social and turning into a stump
29-08-2018T00:19:16,unsteddyphoenix,yeah if I didnt have friends making me go out I would be a stump
29-08-2018T00:19:49,Mippy,I'm quite the room hurmit
29-08-2018T00:20:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Pretty sure we all are
29-08-2018T00:20:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom may have the crown though
29-08-2018T00:20:59,ferociousfox,"I hate to be that ""yolo guy"" but its true. Come on now, you only live once, gotta get out and enjoy it :ptv-hearts:"
29-08-2018T00:21:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe later
29-08-2018T00:21:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Only reason I‚Äôm leaving my house tomorrow is if Mark comes down to do some filming for a video
29-08-2018T00:22:23,Mippy,Tomorrow...gotta go to work
29-08-2018T00:22:49,ferociousfox,"I have a friend that says, ""if you aren't gonna live your life, better start believing in reincarnation"

29-08-2018T00:35:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Working in a place where I see tantrums and lack of discipline from all ages really makes me consider a single life
29-08-2018T00:43:40,Dadrobit,&gt;.&gt; A burrito does sound good though. Not gonna lie.
29-08-2018T00:44:16,Dadrobit,Might head out and get one. Mexican joints around here are almost all 24hr service.
29-08-2018T00:53:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Nothing like a 3 a.m. burrito üåØ
29-08-2018T00:53:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Though it‚Äôs more 1 right now but I also have my own snacks already
29-08-2018T01:03:36,Vatruvius,Hello everyone! :ptv-greetings: Hey Tom!
29-08-2018T01:04:37,Vatruvius,"Mind if I share some names from my web comic, I would like to get some of your guys opinions."
29-08-2018T01:05:03,ferociousfox,V-
29-08-2018T01:05:15,ferociousfox,im going to bed
29-08-2018T01:05:37,ferociousfox,but id look at them in the morning
29-08-2018T01:05:55,ferociousfox,or now if you're quick enough
29-08-2018T01:06:20,Bgrmystr2,ah I thought you were phoenix
29-08-2018T01:06:24,Bgrmystr2,and I was like wat.
29-08-2018T01:07:22,ferociousfox,"Yeah, I changed my username color to purple cause its my favorite. sorry if its confusing"
29-08-2018T01:08:24,Vatruvius,"Alright. One character is female, I was thinking her name could be Amber. The other is male and I was thinking of Marcus. As for a more informal name for my beast race as Homo nasci is a bit long, I was thinking Voran."
29-08-2018T01:09:01,Vatruvius,Nothing is set in stone but this is the first time I actually had names for these things.
29-08-2018T01:09:30,ferociousfox,These things are people :ptv-angry:
29-08-2018T01:09:34,ferociousfox,haha
29-08-2018T01:09:53,ferociousfox,I've always felt like the name Amber is underused
29-08-2018T01:10:14,Bgrmystr2,"I've seen it used a lot, honestly."
29-08-2018T01:10:47,Vatruvius,I have never come across someone named amber except for the sap in geology class.
29-08-2018T01:10:57,Vatruvius,"Fossilized sap, I know."
29-08-2018T01:11:26,Vatruvius,But I thought it was fitting for the character. Some unique but gentle sounding.
29-08-2018T01:11:35,Vatruvius,Something*
29-08-2018T01:11:42,Vatruvius,Calming.
29-08-2018T01:11:51,ferociousfox,it really is a beautiful name
29-08-2018T01:12:10,ferociousfox,"I think I remember a character from the tv series House being named Amber, but thats about it"
29-08-2018T01:13:40,Vatruvius,That is a throwback. I never watch House buy I know my mom did a long time ago back when we had satTV. I was rather young and the whole doctor thing never grabbed my show attention span back then.
29-08-2018T01:13:48,Vatruvius,watched*
29-08-2018T01:13:51,Vatruvius,but*
29-08-2018T01:14:00,Vatruvius,:ctwokinds-eyeroll:
29-08-2018T01:14:22,Vatruvius,short attention span*
29-08-2018T01:14:25,Vatruvius,Good god!
29-08-2018T01:14:35,Vatruvius,:ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:
29-08-2018T01:15:15,ferociousfox,"lol, no need to self correct, I know what your tryin to say"
29-08-2018T01:15:51,ferociousfox,"I think im realizing I really dont know what to say,"
29-08-2018T01:15:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Vat has regular problems with technology
29-08-2018T01:16:18,ferociousfox,"sorry, wish i could be more help but i really should get some sleep"
29-08-2018T01:18:53,Vatruvius,"Seriously, I have regular problems with technology. I set up my computer all by myself, and some forum guiding, and nothing went wrong. I have a fully functioning computer!"
29-08-2018T01:19:08,Vatruvius,Well get some sleep then. XD
29-08-2018T01:25:51,Vatruvius,And what do you think Kiwi? Of the names?
29-08-2018T01:26:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Cool
29-08-2018T01:26:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I know one person named Amber. And I work with a Marcus
29-08-2018T01:26:55,Vatruvius,Does Voran sound good?
29-08-2018T01:27:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I guess so. It‚Äôs your thing
29-08-2018T01:27:27,Vatruvius,I came here for opinions.
29-08-2018T01:27:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Whatever you pick is gonna be cannon
29-08-2018T01:27:46,Vatruvius,EXACTLY! I have to get it right!
29-08-2018T01:28:41,Vatruvius,The storyline is coming along nicely though. Things are getting more flushed.
29-08-2018T01:28:54,Vatruvius,I still have no individual page ideas yet though.
29-08-2018T01:29:01,Vatruvius,That is going to be the hard part I think.
29-08-2018T01:30:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"What‚Äôs the main character. What are they doing. Why. For what end. Any problems. Anyone with them. If so, see points one and two"
29-08-2018T01:30:42,Vatruvius,I have that down.
29-08-2018T01:31:21,Vatruvius,It is just figuring out a starting point for the web comic I suppose. What will be the first page to start it all off.
29-08-2018T01:31:28,SpazztasticKiwi,What scene(s) can you paint with that. Do you even know entirely what your characters look like. How they hold themselves
29-08-2018T01:31:53,Vatruvius,"Yes actually, I have a good idea of my charcters."
29-08-2018T01:32:02,Vatruvius,characters*
29-08-2018T01:32:46,Vatruvius,I know I have plenty of time to get this all done as I still have to learn Ps and find my art style.
29-08-2018T01:33:12,Vatruvius,But I would like to have things planed out in advance so if I get stuck there is no break in the release of pages.
29-08-2018T01:36:03,SpazztasticKiwi,My literary skills are essays and some general plot planning. I‚Äôm not keen on comic plans. That‚Äôd be Tom
29-08-2018T01:38:58,Vatruvius,"I was thinking having about 5 pages fully planned out in advance. Text, panels, etc. That way I have buffer to work on future panels if I get stuck. But I definitely need to have an overarching direction for the panels or what would be a chapter."
29-08-2018T01:39:10,Vatruvius,Nothing is split up into chapters yet or anything.
29-08-2018T01:39:16,Vatruvius,Just a general direction for the most part.
29-08-2018T01:39:28,Vatruvius,But I am liking the direction the story is going.
29-08-2018T01:45:19,Vatruvius,It should almost 3 for you but are you around @Twokinds?
29-08-2018T01:46:40,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, it's been almost 2 hrs since he said something?"
29-08-2018T01:47:09,Vatruvius,"I cannot tell, I have not been around that long to see the chat history."
29-08-2018T01:47:55,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-kingtea:
29-08-2018T01:48:07,Vatruvius,"Ah, just sipping some tea."
29-08-2018T01:48:27,Vatruvius,I am curious what you think or any tips you could give for me if you have the time?
29-08-2018T01:48:56,Twokinds,It is almost 3am so I'm not sure how coherent my advice will be
29-08-2018T01:49:03,Twokinds,what specifically
29-08-2018T01:49:06,Bgrmystr2,there he is
29-08-2018T01:49:20,Bgrmystr2,weren't you going to sleep around this time recently?
29-08-2018T01:49:26,Bgrmystr2,within the past month or two
29-08-2018T01:49:53,Vatruvius,"Well, I guess the most daunting thing for me is trying to plan out a single chapter of a web comic and the pages there in?"
29-08-2018T01:50:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not sure he does sleep. More like he closes his eyes for an elongated blink
29-08-2018T01:50:18,Vatruvius,lol
29-08-2018T01:51:27,Twokinds,Planning things is hard
29-08-2018T01:51:37,Twokinds,I wish I could plan things
29-08-2018T01:52:00,Twokinds,I usually have general goals but work by the seat of my pants
29-08-2018T01:52:47,Vatruvius,"So, you have they plot that is the chapter and you just plan out a page each week?"
29-08-2018T01:54:13,unsteddyphoenix,I think a lot of characters actually do that that way
29-08-2018T01:54:26,unsteddyphoenix,*artists whoops
29-08-2018T01:55:06,Vatruvius,That would make sense to me as well and was kinda what I was thinking however I just wanted to be a few pages ahead so as give myself a buffer just in case I get stuck on a single page.
29-08-2018T01:56:13,Vatruvius,"I guess the hard part here then is deciding what I want to be the first chapter of the plot I have so far, how much of the plot I need to fill out more, and figure out a first page."
29-08-2018T01:56:17,Vatruvius,That and a comic name...sigh.
29-08-2018T01:56:26,Vatruvius,That is going to kill me.
29-08-2018T01:59:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Not if life gets to you first
29-08-2018T01:59:43,Vatruvius,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA::ctwokinds-eyeroll:
29-08-2018T02:01:43,Vatruvius,Do you have any recommendations of when is a good point to end a chapter @Twokinds?
29-08-2018T02:02:17,Vatruvius,"Like, when in the plot?"
29-08-2018T02:03:54,Twokinds,Uh
29-08-2018T02:04:44,Twokinds,"Well, usually people end a chapter on either a resolution, or some climatic moment"
29-08-2018T02:04:45,unsteddyphoenix,the middle
29-08-2018T02:04:51,unsteddyphoenix,end it in the middle of the plot
29-08-2018T02:05:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Like an infuriating paradox
29-08-2018T02:05:13,Vatruvius,"Yes, that would make for a very usnteddy web comic!"
29-08-2018T02:05:46,Twokinds,"Whatever it is, it should be something to make people want to see the payoff."
29-08-2018T02:06:34,Vatruvius,"My problem right now is the plot/storyline I have right now goes quite a ways into the comic. Like, I am expecting to get quite a few pages before I get there. Certainly enough to be split into multiple chapters."
29-08-2018T02:06:53,Vatruvius,But my plot/storyline is not detailed enough yet that I can determine those end/start points.
29-08-2018T02:07:45,Bgrmystr2,Will Frieza kill everyone else but himself? Will Vegeta finally make his own sandwich? How many saiyans does it take to screw in a lightbulb?! FIND OUT NEXT TIME ON THE NEXT EPISODE OF... *[DRAGON BALL Z] :ptv-excited:

29-08-2018T02:08:49,Bgrmystr2,top-tier
29-08-2018T02:08:50,Vatruvius,What!? No!
29-08-2018T02:08:54,Bgrmystr2,haha
29-08-2018T02:08:58,Bgrmystr2,they aren't perfect
29-08-2018T02:09:03,Vatruvius,That is terrible!
29-08-2018T02:09:03,Bgrmystr2,obviously
29-08-2018T02:09:07,Bgrmystr2,it is.
29-08-2018T02:09:45,Twokinds,Just skip all the boring stuff can get right to the action
29-08-2018T02:09:50,Twokinds,You can explain everything later!
29-08-2018T02:10:11,Bgrmystr2,"DBZ is one of those shows that the next episode thing is so god damn over-the-top, but it's always a perfect example of where to end stuff cuz 90% of DBZ is drama."
29-08-2018T02:10:24,Bgrmystr2,"unnecessary drama, but drama nonetheless."
29-08-2018T02:10:34,Vatruvius,"But with that in mind, I am going to either have much larger, and fewer chapters or just one super chapter and I guess that is what the comic will be."
29-08-2018T02:10:58,Bgrmystr2,Keep in mind that you don't HAVE to have chapters..
29-08-2018T02:11:08,unsteddyphoenix,"Action, action, action, infodump page, action"
29-08-2018T02:11:27,Vatruvius,"I am not thinking of explaining anything in my world, not directly or through boring pages anyone. Is that what you mean Tom?"
29-08-2018T02:11:40,Bgrmystr2,it took over what... TWO THOUSAND pages for Freefall to get to chapter two?
29-08-2018T02:12:02,Bgrmystr2,cuz chapters don't really mean anything unless you make it mean something
29-08-2018T02:12:15,Vatruvius,"Well, it is true that I do not need to do chapters but I think it would be nice and will set the tone."
29-08-2018T02:13:12,Bgrmystr2,"instead of trying to figure out where the chapter fits in the story, and trying to figure out where to end it, take your story, and look at where things happen, and end the chapter based on the story instead"
29-08-2018T02:13:13,Vatruvius,But in this case it would make sense that my chapters would just be rather large.
29-08-2018T02:14:01,Vatruvius,"That is what I want to do, I just do not have my story detailed enough for me to do. Like, to put it in perspective, I have an overarching plot that would cover many months in the comic."
29-08-2018T02:14:28,Vatruvius,That plot is what I am working on pretty much.
29-08-2018T02:14:42,Bgrmystr2,"I always see people trying to fit a certain amount of things inside a chapter, like how manga have a certain number of pages in the magazine they're published.. but that's super limiting and can destroy how you want to tell the story."
29-08-2018T02:14:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Chapter 2: ‚ÄúWhat happens next? Hell if I know‚Äù
29-08-2018T02:15:23,Vatruvius,"Alright, then I will push chapters out to be the last thing I think about."
29-08-2018T02:15:32,Bgrmystr2,"Webcomics don't have that limitation, so don't worry about the chapter as much as worry about your story itself, and just find good place for them to end"
29-08-2018T02:15:36,Vatruvius,Get the story down first.
29-08-2018T02:15:49,SpazztasticKiwi,C3: ‚ÄúI planned this at 2 am. Maybe it makes sense. Maybe not‚Äù
29-08-2018T02:15:55,Twokinds,I'm heading to bed
29-08-2018T02:15:57,Twokinds,G'night
29-08-2018T02:16:02,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
29-08-2018T02:16:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Night Tom
29-08-2018T02:16:07,Vatruvius,Goodnight Tom! Thanks for the advice.
29-08-2018T02:16:10,Bgrmystr2,"like.. if you reach a final battle or something that you've been building up momentum for, that could be a stopping point before shit hits the fan"
29-08-2018T02:16:13,Bgrmystr2,gnight tom
29-08-2018T02:16:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Enjoy that elongated blink
29-08-2018T02:16:36,unsteddyphoenix,gnight
29-08-2018T02:16:57,Vatruvius,I do have a major event in my comic that will be a huge bomb shell that I am thinking of making the conclusion of a chapter.
29-08-2018T02:17:17,Vatruvius,"But again, that is a long ways away."
29-08-2018T02:17:36,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúWhat was that you ask? Eh. I‚Äôll tell you in a year.‚Äù
29-08-2018T02:17:37,Vatruvius,"Unless, that would be the end of chapter one."
29-08-2018T02:17:40,Vatruvius,Hmm...?
29-08-2018T02:17:41,Bgrmystr2,"your main character opens the door of the big bad's mansion, says someshit like ""Oi, you're a buttface and I'm here to stop you cuz I'm the hero or whatever"" And the guy comes out and is like ""WELL COME AT ME BRO"" and just roll credits there."
29-08-2018T02:18:00,Bgrmystr2,"hell, you could have it end when he opens the door"
29-08-2018T02:18:07,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, it's just an example but like"
29-08-2018T02:18:10,Bgrmystr2,that kinda stuff
29-08-2018T02:18:23,Bgrmystr2,"super easy to leave as cliffhanger, leave the reader wanting to know what happens"
29-08-2018T02:18:33,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúHeros only through this door. Yes that means you. Story‚Äôs over‚Äù
29-08-2018T02:18:41,Bgrmystr2,"HOOK them for the next chapter, and they'll come back"
29-08-2018T02:19:12,Vatruvius,I do not really want to give away spoilers but there is a very specific thing I am doing with my comic to help tell the story. And this element does not show up or become obvious to the reader until right at this bombshell moment. So maybe that should be
29-08-2018T02:19:19,Vatruvius,the end of the first chapter.
29-08-2018T02:19:37,Bgrmystr2,yeah see that's absolutely a chapter end
29-08-2018T02:19:38,Vatruvius,No matter its length. And the chapter be given a clever name.
29-08-2018T02:19:46,Bgrmystr2,bombshells are chapter enders.
29-08-2018T02:20:19,Bgrmystr2,lore bombs blow people's minds when there's a twist.. and then.. roll credits
29-08-2018T02:20:30,Vatruvius,"Thing is, this bombsheel moment is like two bombshell moments in one."
29-08-2018T02:20:30,Bgrmystr2,the rage from ppl wanting it to continue &gt;:U
29-08-2018T02:20:42,Bgrmystr2,yeah but it's still one moment
29-08-2018T02:21:32,Vatruvius,"Yeah, but I will certainly need to like shut off the comments section otherwise the server will crash when that pages gets posted."
29-08-2018T02:21:49,Vatruvius,page*
29-08-2018T02:22:06,Vatruvius,I oddly want to get to the point and see the chaos.
29-08-2018T02:22:29,Vatruvius,And know I understand why screenwriters do shit that pisses me off in amazing TV shows!
29-08-2018T02:22:36,Bgrmystr2,you gotta get readers hooked on your story before that
29-08-2018T02:23:01,Bgrmystr2,"good characters, or bad characters, either way, they have to be characters people love to love, or love to hate. they have to entice emotion from people, no matter what it is"
29-08-2018T02:23:15,Vatruvius,"Like I said, this will be many months in the comic so many pages and time to connect with the characters and the universe."
29-08-2018T02:23:21,Bgrmystr2,lots of important things with comics
29-08-2018T02:24:47,Bgrmystr2,"now.. you could possibly just have the ENTIRE chapter in one go, complete with the bombshell and the ending within.. and have everything resolved.. and then end it with like.. a letter from someone that the reader can't see or"
29-08-2018T02:24:52,Bgrmystr2,some kind of message.. or a visitor
29-08-2018T02:24:56,Bgrmystr2,or somesuch
29-08-2018T02:25:00,Bgrmystr2,that says bad shit be approaching
29-08-2018T02:25:06,Vatruvius,Should I let the first couple of pages set the scene? Like the where and who? Just something basic but not like an immediate jump into the deep end not knowing what is going on.
29-08-2018T02:26:10,Bgrmystr2,"uhhh. it's hard. I've always enjoyed stories that are self-explainatory. A lot of stories go with the monologue route, others jump you into a story with no knowledge at all"
29-08-2018T02:26:13,Bgrmystr2,and both have their issues
29-08-2018T02:26:14,Vatruvius,"For example; this is somesuch city, the so and so of the planet somesuch, etc."
29-08-2018T02:26:55,Bgrmystr2,"but it's great to just.. go into a story without any kind of monologue, without any kind of text telling you what you're looking at... just something that you can see yourself.. see what it is, how things are"
29-08-2018T02:26:59,Vatruvius,I just want to get the reader's feet wet without jumping right into the comic.
29-08-2018T02:27:05,Bgrmystr2,like a textless opening
29-08-2018T02:27:20,Bgrmystr2,"they're rare, and when done right, are amazing"
29-08-2018T02:27:33,Vatruvius,It could be a textless opening with like the comic title.
29-08-2018T02:27:43,Vatruvius,Hmm...now you got me thinking.
29-08-2018T02:27:52,Bgrmystr2,well I mean the first few pages
29-08-2018T02:27:58,Vatruvius,Yeah.
29-08-2018T02:28:41,Vatruvius,"Textless opening with a sort of, if this was a video, fade to a cityscape scene and the comic title."
29-08-2018T02:29:12,Bgrmystr2,"like for example if you wanted to introduce a steampunk world.. you could show like.. huge cliffs with structures and huge steam pipes.. a panel with multiple steam engines at a train station, fade to people that may or may not be important later.."
29-08-2018T02:29:20,Vatruvius,I will think it over. But I love the idea of not just having the first page be the main character/characters right off the bat.
29-08-2018T02:29:22,Bgrmystr2,"don't even introduce them, just show them as bystandards hanging out in the city"
29-08-2018T02:29:42,Bgrmystr2,show main character doin his normal shit.. living his normal day..
29-08-2018T02:30:22,Vatruvius,Having the main character just doing their normal thing fits perfectly with the beginning of my comic.
29-08-2018T02:30:26,Vatruvius,"So yeah, I could do that."
29-08-2018T02:30:32,Bgrmystr2,"it's quiet, there's no monologue, no thrust into a world you don't understand, it's to create a setting"
29-08-2018T02:30:49,Bgrmystr2,"the setting doesn't need words, it needs visuals"
29-08-2018T02:31:21,Twokinds,"Yeah but at the same time, you do want to catch your reader's eye"
29-08-2018T02:31:38,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah, introducing that setting is not something everyone does. it's not a guarenteed success"
29-08-2018T02:31:42,Vatruvius,Considering my comic takes place in a futuristic cityscape I can make some nice overview shots and just regular citylife stuff to introduce the reader in my universe.
29-08-2018T02:31:45,Twokinds,"I've seen a lot of webcomics that start with like 10 pages without dialogue, or 5 pages of nothing but text boxes"
29-08-2018T02:31:56,Twokinds,"It's pretty boring, and makes it hard to keep going."
29-08-2018T02:32:05,Bgrmystr2,10 pages is kind of a lot
29-08-2018T02:32:16,Vatruvius,I was thinking like 3 pages max.
29-08-2018T02:32:27,Vatruvius,Probably 2.
29-08-2018T02:32:32,Bgrmystr2,I was only thinking of like maybe one or two yeah exactly
29-08-2018T02:32:51,Bgrmystr2,"hell, maybe halfway through the 2nd one, depending on how much you have to show, I dunno"
29-08-2018T02:33:07,Twokinds,I really roll my eyes at big lore dumps front-loaded to comics.
29-08-2018T02:33:19,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, the monologue"
29-08-2018T02:33:24,Twokinds,"Like, I get it, you're super proud of this world you made, but it's a comic. It's visual. I wanna see it! Through the plot."
29-08-2018T02:33:25,Bgrmystr2,ehh :u
29-08-2018T02:33:25,Vatruvius,"Like, have the first be a good intro and the second half of the second page fade to the comic"
29-08-2018T02:34:06,Vatruvius,By intro I do mean just images.
29-08-2018T02:35:58,Bgrmystr2,"what I think is good is to look at opening videos to games. Like for example.. the intro video to something like The Sims 1, or Simcity 3000, or even the Unlimited expansion. Borderlands.."
29-08-2018T02:36:06,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah its annoying when like. The characters just SAY what theyre doing or feeling every time. Some things should be able to be shown visually
29-08-2018T02:36:34,Bgrmystr2,"there's a lot of games where they introduce the game with visuals, and while games are much more easy to do that with, it's a driving point for comics cuz it works there too"
29-08-2018T02:36:46,unsteddyphoenix,Instead we get massive text bubbles blocking all the art
29-08-2018T02:36:59,Bgrmystr2,yup ^
29-08-2018T02:37:03,Vatruvius,"Yeah, and I do not want everything to be narrated. I want it to be shown. That is kind of the point. Otherwise I would just write a book."
29-08-2018T02:37:24,unsteddyphoenix,Exactly~
29-08-2018T02:37:41,Bgrmystr2,"""Narration"" - Cinema Sins *[ding]"
29-08-2018T02:37:54,Vatruvius,lol
29-08-2018T02:38:32,Bgrmystr2,"It shouldn't be abandoned, but strategic"
29-08-2018T02:38:48,Bgrmystr2,"perhaps even just for fun, like deadpool does"
29-08-2018T02:38:55,Bgrmystr2,with the 4th wall kinda deal
29-08-2018T02:39:14,Vatruvius,"Yeah, I am certainly going for the immersion feel."
29-08-2018T02:39:26,Vatruvius,So no 4th wall breaking with my comic.
29-08-2018T02:39:31,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. one of the games literally uses the narration boxes to help him get further.. so I mean xD
29-08-2018T02:39:36,Bgrmystr2,that's always a path
29-08-2018T02:39:42,Bgrmystr2,but yeah immersion won't have any of that
29-08-2018T02:39:56,Vatruvius,"Like the Stanley Parable, great game."
29-08-2018T02:40:07,Bgrmystr2,haven't played it
29-08-2018T02:40:17,Twokinds,"Honestly, if it's not important to the plot, it's probably not necessary. You can hint a lot about the world without showing a lot of it."
29-08-2018T02:40:20,Vatruvius,"""Behind the desk was a secret keypad and the code was..."""
29-08-2018T02:40:31,unsteddyphoenix,Agreed
29-08-2018T02:40:36,Bgrmystr2,"but I did play Portal, and that game is an amazing example of immersion"
29-08-2018T02:40:47,Bgrmystr2,both 1 and 2
29-08-2018T02:41:08,unsteddyphoenix,Plus a lot of the time leaving things like xharacters feelings ambiguos is better
29-08-2018T02:41:10,Vatruvius,"Yeah, I do not plan on describing my world at all. I want to capture it as it is, a dynamic world that the characters interact with."
29-08-2018T02:41:49,Vatruvius,Any story elements and details come out with the story and character interaction.
29-08-2018T02:41:57,unsteddyphoenix,"Well you might need SOME infodumps, juat not all that way"
29-08-2018T02:42:39,Vatruvius,"I can see that, but any info dumps I would like to cleaver disguise as part of the world."
29-08-2018T02:43:05,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-natanisleep:
29-08-2018T02:43:22,Vatruvius,"Say for example, there is this thing being made that is part of my world that I need the readers to know about, perhaps the character picks up and reads a pamphlet about it."
29-08-2018T02:43:27,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah ideally
29-08-2018T02:43:28,Vatruvius,Night again Tom!
29-08-2018T02:43:44,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I'm just one voice, but the best thing I could suggest is to just.. go into the field of which you want to understand and just.. immerse yourself in it. Watching anime, reading manga, and playing a bunch of games.."
29-08-2018T02:43:47,unsteddyphoenix,Be creative with it where possible
29-08-2018T02:44:06,Bgrmystr2,"it's a great way to learn as many ways of introducing worlds, characters, and scenarios as possible"
29-08-2018T02:44:57,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to bed‚Äù returns moments later
29-08-2018T02:45:12,Vatruvius,"Well, I do have a large background of games played, it is actually what has influenced this element I am using for my comic that will reveal itself at the end of the chapter with the bombshell."
29-08-2018T02:45:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, CinemaSins reference"
29-08-2018T02:45:25,Bgrmystr2,"seeing what other people have done for character interactions, noticing the reader's general reaction to it..., that kinda stuff"
29-08-2018T02:45:32,unsteddyphoenix,Ding!
29-08-2018T02:45:35,Bgrmystr2,is all important cuz you're going to be in the creator's shoes
29-08-2018T02:45:57,Vatruvius,I know! Scary!
29-08-2018T02:46:58,Bgrmystr2,I've got hundreds of anime and manga under my belt.. hundreds of games too
29-08-2018T02:47:18,Bgrmystr2,even I don't think I'd know enough to start a good comic
29-08-2018T02:47:27,Bgrmystr2,a lot of learning comes from just.. doing it
29-08-2018T02:47:34,Bgrmystr2,just.. experience
29-08-2018T02:47:57,Bgrmystr2,"but knowing what you're getting into and what you're trying to go for is a great first step, one not many people generally take"
29-08-2018T02:48:03,Vatruvius,"I am not saying I know enough, just that I have a creative drive and it has manifested itself into a web comic. I am sure I will make many mistakes/changes."
29-08-2018T02:48:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm out too
29-08-2018T02:48:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Theoretically
29-08-2018T02:49:02,Vatruvius,But asking for opinions and advice can only ever help me since this is totally new to me.
29-08-2018T02:49:30,Bgrmystr2,"Make sure to take everything you see seriously, even the hateful comments the internet is known for vatru, for all the vitrol it's worth.. there's always something behind the message 95% of the time."
29-08-2018T02:49:39,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, the other 5% is obvious troll bait"
29-08-2018T02:50:02,Vatruvius,"Yeah, I have taken enough burns online and offline to not let it get to me."
29-08-2018T02:50:07,Bgrmystr2,but there's a lot more out there
29-08-2018T02:50:16,Vatruvius,I look at it subjectively rather than personal.
29-08-2018T02:50:24,Bgrmystr2,you'll get a lot more than you ever have just personally when you start writing a comic
29-08-2018T02:50:31,Bgrmystr2,and ppl start reading it
29-08-2018T02:50:37,Bgrmystr2,a WHOLE lot
29-08-2018T02:51:03,Vatruvius,"If it is just hateful, I am not trying to impress that individual so they mean nothing. But if I can pull something useful out of the comment, I will take it."
29-08-2018T02:51:21,Bgrmystr2,Exactly.
29-08-2018T02:51:34,Bgrmystr2,"So like, I don't expect you to fail, but I'm going to wish you the best, cuz it's gonna be a long road"
29-08-2018T02:52:07,Vatruvius,I doubt I will have anything up for many months to come. But I am glad that I am see.ing progress made every week
29-08-2018T02:53:29,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, progress is good"
29-08-2018T02:54:35,Bgrmystr2,"Always remember to keep increasing your horizon. Watch and read more things. Go back sometimes and experience things you already have from the past.. maybe it'll be different, maybe you'll see something new, or have a differing opinion since then.."
29-08-2018T02:54:41,Vatruvius,"And as far as I am concerned, I really just want to make this thing. No one has to like it, I just want to do it because that to me is fun. If fans start to come along, added bonus."
29-08-2018T02:54:42,Bgrmystr2,always more.
29-08-2018T02:55:10,Bgrmystr2,that's a good thing
29-08-2018T02:55:22,Bgrmystr2,"do it for you, not for anyone else. Do it for you, make it the best you can make it be"
29-08-2018T02:55:30,Bgrmystr2,and don't be afraid of criticism
29-08-2018T02:55:44,Bgrmystr2,"cuz when you get better, your story gets better"
29-08-2018T02:56:05,Vatruvius,"Nah, my comic will be perfect! No need for criticism! :ctwokinds-wink:"
29-08-2018T02:56:14,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh: mmmmmmmmmmmhmmmmmmm

29-08-2018T03:09:42,Vatruvius,I like this.
29-08-2018T03:10:13,Vatruvius,Still up for debate if this becomes part of the story but...it is nice.

29-08-2018T16:31:14,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs a piece of cardboard in the hall and Bagheera is flipping out for it and I don‚Äôt know why

29-08-2018T16:41:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a cat the likes pets but he‚Äôs tripping out in the hall rn
29-08-2018T16:41:32,SpazztasticKiwi,*that
29-08-2018T16:42:05,Mippy,Oh cats...I spend so much time watching cat videos.
29-08-2018T16:42:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Have you seen the ‚Äúno Maxwell‚Äù one with the very angry kitty
29-08-2018T16:42:33,Mippy,It‚Äôs a bit hard to pay my pets...one is prickly and the others involve getting wet
29-08-2018T16:43:42,Mippy,I don‚Äôt think I have! Thanks for the cat vid recramendation.
29-08-2018T16:43:50,SpazztasticKiwi,https://youtu.be/v9B-QgKvubs
29-08-2018T16:43:57,Mippy,Also...I meant pat...not pay

29-08-2018T16:44:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Fluffy kitty. Much anger
29-08-2018T16:45:41,Mippy,XD holy üí©...thanks! I love that. He just launches himself at her
29-08-2018T16:45:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve been trying to catch a video of my cat Bagheera snoring
29-08-2018T16:46:47,Mippy,I‚Äôd watch that.
29-08-2018T16:47:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I do have pictures of him falling asleep from a head rub on my Twitter
29-08-2018T16:48:03,Mippy,Cute
29-08-2018T16:49:18,Mippy,I like to joke that I am the owner of a living dish rag. I should video Mister running around under his dish rag blanket sometime.
29-08-2018T16:50:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"I tend to say my cats are basically my kids. Before I had Bagheera and just had Kiwi, one lady thought that I actually had a five year old. When I was 18."
29-08-2018T16:51:57,Mippy,Wow...
29-08-2018T16:52:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"It‚Äôs not impossible but, I‚Äôm not in that big a hurry"
29-08-2018T16:52:33,Mippy,nor am I

29-08-2018T17:01:11,Twokinds,Why are you looking at cat videos at work
29-08-2018T17:01:46,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake: Get back to work!
29-08-2018T17:04:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Aren‚Äôt you also technically at work Tom? And you‚Äôre chatting online?

29-08-2018T17:05:25,SpazztasticKiwi,:ctwokinds-sleepoverA: cat videos are scientific. You‚Äôre studying behavior
29-08-2018T17:05:34,Twokinds,...
29-08-2018T17:05:41,Twokinds,This is my work
29-08-2018T17:06:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I need to transfer then. Getting paid to chat is :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
29-08-2018T17:07:55,Twokinds,It's a pretty sweet gig
29-08-2018T17:10:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Dunno about the coworkers though. Seems it‚Äôd be crowded
29-08-2018T17:12:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"However maybe it‚Äôs not the amount of coworkers, but whether they‚Äôre tolerable cause I know at my job I keep my headphones in to drown out the gossiper"
29-08-2018T17:15:24,Twokinds,heheh
29-08-2018T17:17:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember I got cinnamon rolls in the fridge hold on

29-08-2018T17:27:30,Twokinds,anything
29-08-2018T17:27:52,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds Have you ever tried Schezuan Beef?
29-08-2018T17:28:09,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds It's a Vietnamese dish my father likes to make. It tastes DIVINE.
29-08-2018T17:28:31,Ebonstride,Oh hey people are here
29-08-2018T17:29:00,CrimsonQuill,@Ebonstride Very briefly for me. It's 11:30pm here.
29-08-2018T17:29:15,Ebonstride,Oh dang
29-08-2018T17:32:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I was in the mood for fish yesterday. Had a fish sandwich. Kinda want another one but that means going into town
29-08-2018T17:32:52,Ebonstride,Worth?
29-08-2018T17:34:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Not worth it
29-08-2018T17:37:06,CrimsonQuill,I like fish.
29-08-2018T17:44:02,CrimsonQuill,Goodnight all.

29-08-2018T17:53:06,Dadrobit,"Man, not gonna lie. Now that I'm finally fairly established as someone who wors from home, it's actually mind boggling to think how rough it must be for folks like yourself, Tom."
29-08-2018T17:54:26,Dadrobit,"Like, I spent years going to school specifically for setting up my career in mind, and I have fairly big foundations that help me market and monetize myself, and it's still honestly kind of scary worrying about my future without a stable 9 to 5 paycheck"
29-08-2018T17:55:06,Dadrobit,Kudos to all y'all that are making it happen. Shit's scary for real.
29-08-2018T18:00:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember the months I was between leaving McDonald‚Äôs and going to Walmart. Headache personified. But it literally paid off
29-08-2018T19:28:17,CrRAR,"aloha, muchachos."
29-08-2018T19:38:57,CrRAR,"That's livin' the dream robit, yeah it's got its own worries but when you can do your job from ANYWHERE."

29-08-2018T20:21:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Why‚Äôs the salt and pepper in the Kat sketch look like they‚Äôre from Blues Clues
29-08-2018T20:23:22,Bgrmystr2,you can't see any salt or pepper shaker in the sketch lol
29-08-2018T20:23:42,Bgrmystr2,it's all just blotches of blue
29-08-2018T20:26:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Fine
29-08-2018T20:26:43,SpazztasticKiwi,The colored post
29-08-2018T20:27:14,Bgrmystr2,"oooooh, I dunno they look normal to me in that one :v"
29-08-2018T20:27:32,Bgrmystr2,I'm curious about the background thing that looks like half a hand pointing at the ceiling
29-08-2018T20:27:55,Bgrmystr2,near the flowers on the left side
29-08-2018T20:33:38,ferociousfox,Isn't that the handle to the sink faucet?
29-08-2018T20:34:19,Bgrmystr2,mmmmm... could be? I've never seen a hand-pointing-shaped handle before. :ptv-wondering:
29-08-2018T20:34:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I just noticed the little sticky note on the cupboard
29-08-2018T20:34:55,Bgrmystr2,lol late xD
29-08-2018T20:35:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Faucet handle looks like a side view of a bunny head
29-08-2018T20:36:09,SpazztasticKiwi,And I want to say those flowers are daffodils üåº
29-08-2018T20:36:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"But also, what‚Äôs the box thing next to the strainer"
29-08-2018T20:39:19,Bgrmystr2,yeah I can see the bunny head thing
29-08-2018T20:39:33,Bgrmystr2,I'm gonna refrain from stating what else it looks like.
29-08-2018T20:40:49,Bgrmystr2,That box thing next to the strainer... at first glance I thought it was part of a stovetop
29-08-2018T20:41:06,Bgrmystr2,"like, the handles for it"
29-08-2018T20:42:22,Bgrmystr2,dunno if there's enough space for it though.. and the strainer looks plastic
29-08-2018T20:43:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Love how we‚Äôre picking apart the background and essentially grazing over the half naked Kat
29-08-2018T20:43:45,Bgrmystr2,She doesn't have to worry bout dat. I've seen enough internet for that to not bother me. :)
29-08-2018T20:44:00,Bgrmystr2,"still, datass tho :v"
29-08-2018T20:44:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Forget the booty

29-08-2018T20:45:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I could see them with a little more floral print or something but they‚Äôre breezy
29-08-2018T20:45:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Like that apron
29-08-2018T20:46:16,Bgrmystr2,xD

29-08-2018T21:36:17,ferociousfox,question for pet owners
29-08-2018T21:37:05,ferociousfox,Do you have to pretend to sprinkle in a little something special onto the pet food to get them to eat it?
29-08-2018T21:43:13,Ordithus,":ctwokinds-wink: Mewlula, add some spice to your kitty's life."
29-08-2018T21:43:46,Ordithus,"I'm not a present pet owner, but no, never had to."
29-08-2018T22:00:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Sometimes I‚Äôll mix medicine with wet food to get them to take it but I don‚Äôt think that counts
29-08-2018T22:01:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"Although Bagheera has a really bad habit of only really accepting water that I pour for him, often only if it‚Äôs from my own cup"
29-08-2018T22:06:04,ferociousfox,"WOW, theres a great horned owl on the palm tree in my backyard."
29-08-2018T22:06:49,ferociousfox,It's really close to the ground and is ~hooting~ at other owls

29-08-2018T22:33:33,SpazztasticKiwi,They feed my frog
29-08-2018T22:51:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Would Nibbly hunt a mouse or is she too proper and sit-at-the-table
29-08-2018T22:58:19,Ordithus,She only hunts wolves
29-08-2018T23:07:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel she‚Äôd be friends with a little mouse
29-08-2018T23:20:09,Ordithus,Unless this mouse competed for Sythe's affection
29-08-2018T23:30:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Then it would be banished with immense shame
