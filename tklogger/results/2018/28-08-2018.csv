28-08-2018T00:00:09,Dadrobit,:( Now I'm stuck in a vortex of car comparison videos. Thanks Obama...
28-08-2018T00:00:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,thats my life most of the time Dad
28-08-2018T00:00:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,but with bikes mostly
28-08-2018T00:00:35,TheBeckoner,Huh had to look that one up Ord. Nice
28-08-2018T00:01:00,Ordithus,Add lightness
28-08-2018T00:01:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Wonder if Tom’s much of a car person
28-08-2018T00:01:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,he's not
28-08-2018T00:01:15,Dadrobit,I got paid so much money back when I was in security essentially just watching these kinds of videos.
28-08-2018T00:01:15,Ordithus,He likes the red ones
28-08-2018T00:01:27,Dadrobit,That and reading Amenon's fics.
28-08-2018T00:01:43,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-reniembarrassed:
28-08-2018T00:01:44,unsteddyphoenix,Racing stripes make them go faster that's all you need to know~
28-08-2018T00:02:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d like a bright yellow car
28-08-2018T00:02:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"""also get you pulled over, automotive racial profiling."""
28-08-2018T00:02:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Red would be nice but it’s too obvious
28-08-2018T00:02:46,Ordithus,Spoilers add 15 hp
28-08-2018T00:02:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless it was the candy apple red
28-08-2018T00:02:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"My camaro is red, painting it black though"
28-08-2018T00:03:03,SpazztasticKiwi,How dare
28-08-2018T00:03:03,Dadrobit,"Yeah, cop bait is no fun."
28-08-2018T00:03:41,unsteddyphoenix,what!
28-08-2018T00:03:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Legit my dad said this to a cop once ""You know why I pulled you over?"" my dad ""Because my car's black!"""
28-08-2018T00:03:50,unsteddyphoenix,Dont ruin speedstripes for me
28-08-2018T00:03:53,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao
28-08-2018T00:04:09,Dadrobit,Would like to maybe get a decent hatch like a Golf GTI.
28-08-2018T00:04:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I only don’t want a white car cause they collect and show dirt like a gossip
28-08-2018T00:04:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,the new civic type R beat the new Golf's lap time on every track it was on
28-08-2018T00:04:59,Ordithus,"Same with black cars, Kiwi"
28-08-2018T00:05:21,Dadrobit,"Yeah, but the Type R Screeeeeeeams ""Please, pull me over!"""
28-08-2018T00:05:30,Ordithus,It's beautiful when clean.  which lasts 15 minutes
28-08-2018T00:05:38,TheBeckoner,Dont worry itll overheat before it can get pulled over
28-08-2018T00:05:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I know its so cute XD
28-08-2018T00:05:47,Dadrobit,"Golfs are comparable in performance, but looks super mundane."
28-08-2018T00:06:15,TheBeckoner,I like the jetta more tbh
28-08-2018T00:06:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,There is a guy who lives in the same apartments as I do and I have seen his golf get towed home 2 times in the year he's been here
28-08-2018T00:07:20,Dadrobit,Last Volkswagen I was in was my Rabbit (The base for the eventual Golf as I understand it) and I'll admit. I fucking hated that car.
28-08-2018T00:07:25,Dadrobit,Diesel POS.
28-08-2018T00:07:39,Dadrobit,Wouldn't hit 70 mph if you dropped it from a plane.
28-08-2018T00:07:50,Bgrmystr2,xD
28-08-2018T00:08:07,Ordithus,"Ah, the early diesel cars.  So slow"
28-08-2018T00:08:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I don't understand the love VW gets, at most they make ok cars"
28-08-2018T00:08:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Diesel cars are always too loud for me
28-08-2018T00:08:42,SpazztasticKiwi,“IM HERE!!!”
28-08-2018T00:09:00,Dadrobit,But a buddy from security has a Golf and he swears by it. Constantly doing road-trips up to the norther mountains for skiing. Says he's never had an issue.
28-08-2018T00:09:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"smaller diesels are quiet, you're thinking about turbo diesels"
28-08-2018T00:09:11,Ordithus,Modern cheatsy diesel Jetta TDIs are quiet
28-08-2018T00:09:45,Dadrobit,The old Rabbit was small. But so damned loud that the stereo was utterly useless.
28-08-2018T00:09:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,eek
28-08-2018T00:10:00,Dadrobit,"Not just the engine, but the road noise as well."
28-08-2018T00:10:15,SpazztasticKiwi,“IM DRIVING HERE!”
28-08-2018T00:10:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,crappy cabin insulation
28-08-2018T00:10:22,Dadrobit,Literally zero effort was put into sound isolation.
28-08-2018T00:11:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"While we’re talking cars, something else I heard today - a lady drove down the road and her SUV was making a high pitch consistent whistle"
28-08-2018T00:11:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,was it constant for did it go in and out?
28-08-2018T00:11:45,Ordithus,It was about to explode.  Good thing you weren't close
28-08-2018T00:11:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Constant
28-08-2018T00:12:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,could be old break pads
28-08-2018T00:12:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,they tend to either whistle or squeak when on their last legs
28-08-2018T00:12:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember thinking I didn’t know cars could make that high a pitch whistle let alone keep it up
28-08-2018T00:13:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"And she was accelerating as far as I could tell, not braking, but the noise didn’t change when the speed leveled out"
28-08-2018T00:13:12,TheBeckoner,Were they moving quick? deer whistles can make that noise
28-08-2018T00:13:31,Dadrobit,loose belt?
28-08-2018T00:13:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe 40s. Speed limit caps at 50
28-08-2018T00:14:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,could also be a bad timing belt
28-08-2018T00:14:30,Ordithus,:ptv-nope:
28-08-2018T00:14:35,TheBeckoner,"Timng belts are toothed though, they cant slip."
28-08-2018T00:14:44,TheBeckoner,they can skip I guess
28-08-2018T00:14:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,not on my supra or camaro
28-08-2018T00:14:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,they are smooth
28-08-2018T00:15:06,TheBeckoner,The camaro has a timing chain V6 or V8
28-08-2018T00:15:14,TheBeckoner,You mean drive belts?
28-08-2018T00:15:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"I didn’t know what it was. As long as it’s not a loud noise or smoking, I don’t panic"
28-08-2018T00:15:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,its a be;t v6
28-08-2018T00:15:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,belt
28-08-2018T00:15:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember thinking “you need a mechanic”
28-08-2018T00:15:38,TheBeckoner,What year camaro?
28-08-2018T00:15:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,98
28-08-2018T00:16:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"speaking of belts, I need to get a new one for the supra, its as old as the car its self"
28-08-2018T00:17:00,Dadrobit,Looking at an audition request. I'm dying.
28-08-2018T00:17:08,Ordithus,Wasn't the 90s camaro v6 pushrod?
28-08-2018T00:17:08,Dadrobit,"""I am looking for 2 voices that sound like the 2 hosts from 'America Ninja Warrior'. 1) Matt Iseman 2) Akbar Gbajabiamila. This is for a mock video for a Bar Mitzvah about 'America Ninja Warrior'."""
28-08-2018T00:17:29,Bgrmystr2,loool dadro
28-08-2018T00:17:30,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I'll brb guys. I gotta get in on this one."
28-08-2018T00:17:33,Bgrmystr2,that sounds like fun
28-08-2018T00:17:40,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah obviously
28-08-2018T00:17:44,unsteddyphoenix,Is there a working title?
28-08-2018T00:17:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Good luck dad
28-08-2018T00:17:47,Ordithus,do eeet
28-08-2018T00:17:49,TheBeckoner,it had the 3400 or 3800 series Ord
28-08-2018T00:17:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember Mark saying in a video that his GMC truck (“The Barrel”) was acting up. Something with the battery I think but I’m not sure if he mentioned it smoking once or not
28-08-2018T00:18:05,Ordithus,RS would be 3800 series
28-08-2018T00:18:12,Dadrobit,"Title is ""A Not For Broadcast Bar Mitzvah Video"""
28-08-2018T00:18:14,TheBeckoner,I can rember if they were or not but a quick search says they have timing chains
28-08-2018T00:18:17,Ordithus,I drove one once.  It was a basket case...
28-08-2018T00:18:17,TheBeckoner,cant*
28-08-2018T00:18:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I just hope he knows “GTFO” smoke vs “small problem” smoke
28-08-2018T00:18:33,Ordithus,Pushrod would generally have a very short chain
28-08-2018T00:18:36,Ordithus,for the cam
28-08-2018T00:18:39,TheBeckoner,Right
28-08-2018T00:18:46,TheBeckoner,like the small block v8's
28-08-2018T00:18:51,Ordithus,If not just geared directly
28-08-2018T00:18:56,TheBeckoner,or big blocks i guess
28-08-2018T00:18:59,Dadrobit,"Looking at the client history, this seems to be a company that specializes in custom Bar Mitzfahs."
28-08-2018T00:19:33,TheBeckoner,The only directly geared ones were the 2.5 iron duke and the inline 6's gm used to make. That I know of atleast
28-08-2018T00:19:43,Dadrobit,A few other reviews rating them highly for specialty parties.
28-08-2018T00:19:45,unsteddyphoenix,That is such a niche market and I love it
28-08-2018T00:19:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Get on that dad
28-08-2018T00:20:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,that sounds amazing
28-08-2018T00:20:54,Dadrobit,"Definitlely, only 10 other submissions so far. 181 words. $250 payout. EZ money if I can nab it."
28-08-2018T00:21:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Guys this is just a guess but I don’t think Tom’s gonna stream
28-08-2018T00:21:39,unsteddyphoenix,Arent you jewish too or something?
28-08-2018T00:21:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Rip, how come Kiwi"
28-08-2018T00:21:58,unsteddyphoenix,Spazz you might be right :/
28-08-2018T00:22:08,Dadrobit,Used to be Jewish. I got better.
28-08-2018T00:22:11,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RaineEep: whaaaaaaa
28-08-2018T00:22:21,Bgrmystr2,Well Kiwi I mean.. considering..

28-08-2018T00:22:32,Bgrmystr2,at all..
28-08-2018T00:22:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,that was yesterday
28-08-2018T00:22:37,Bgrmystr2,so...... yeahh
28-08-2018T00:22:49,Bgrmystr2,nothing important will probably happen tonight either.
28-08-2018T00:22:55,Dadrobit,Be back in a bit. Don't go having any fun bathroom conversations without me.
28-08-2018T00:22:57,unsteddyphoenix,There could still be one! If we believe!
28-08-2018T00:23:05,unsteddyphoenix,Ok~
28-08-2018T00:23:18,Ordithus,Or send pizza
28-08-2018T00:23:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Quick everyone, bathroom convo"
28-08-2018T00:23:40,Bgrmystr2,"S-so How bout those mirrors, eh? :ptv-confused:"
28-08-2018T00:23:55,Bgrmystr2,runs away
28-08-2018T00:23:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Well I consider this conversation flushed
28-08-2018T00:23:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"forget the mirror, look at that sink"
28-08-2018T00:24:10,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s a sexy sink
28-08-2018T00:24:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Look at the curves
28-08-2018T00:24:45,Ordithus,"If you want to know about a house, look at the bathroom."
28-08-2018T00:24:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,this sink is too lewd
28-08-2018T00:25:31,Ordithus,Why is the shower on fire?
28-08-2018T00:25:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you walk in the bathroom while House shopping and the WiFi dies, it’s no good"
28-08-2018T00:25:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"if you walk into the bathroom and someone says Hi, run"
28-08-2018T00:26:07,unsteddyphoenix,Why? They sound polite
28-08-2018T00:26:13,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floAAA:
28-08-2018T00:26:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I did a study on women’s favorite shampoo
28-08-2018T00:26:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Top answer was “ahhhhhhh”
28-08-2018T00:26:55,TheBeckoner,In-bathroom attendants? must be extra fancy
28-08-2018T00:27:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Second was “how’d you get in here”
28-08-2018T00:27:11,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
28-08-2018T00:27:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Amazing
28-08-2018T00:27:19,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
28-08-2018T00:27:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"Third was “honey, get the gun someone’s in here”"
28-08-2018T00:27:50,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-wink: Now that's dedication to science
28-08-2018T00:27:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Think that one was a his/her wash
28-08-2018T00:28:07,unsteddyphoenix,You mean americans dont keep a gun in every room?
28-08-2018T00:28:15,unsteddyphoenix,That's not what I was led to believe...
28-08-2018T00:28:36,Ordithus,Gotta pack heat even when getting clean
28-08-2018T00:28:48,SpazztasticKiwi,How else do toddlers seem to be shooting them selves accidentally
28-08-2018T00:28:56,Ordithus,Shotgun for the baby
28-08-2018T00:29:25,Ordithus,Howitzer to keep the pigeons off the roof
28-08-2018T00:29:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Shoot the dirt away
28-08-2018T00:29:48,Dadrobit,While Pro Tools is booting up. I'd just like to mention that I keep my guns in the cieling.
28-08-2018T00:29:51,unsteddyphoenix,really gets in those hard to reach places
28-08-2018T00:30:00,Dadrobit,One of the shotguns at least.
28-08-2018T00:30:03,unsteddyphoenix,Ooo do you have like a switch
28-08-2018T00:30:08,unsteddyphoenix,that drops the gun down
28-08-2018T00:30:11,unsteddyphoenix,For emergencies
28-08-2018T00:30:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you’re real good, you can get your dandruff off"
28-08-2018T00:30:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Real close haircut too
28-08-2018T00:30:34,unsteddyphoenix,Call that engaging a kill switch
28-08-2018T00:30:36,Ordithus,Semiauto .45 for shaving
28-08-2018T00:30:44,Bgrmystr2,"""Howitzer to keep the pigeons off the roof"" Fucking ord you're killin me xD"
28-08-2018T00:30:44,Dadrobit,"Nah, it's just a nook in the cieling that a small lanyard hangs out of so I can yank it out."
28-08-2018T00:30:53,Bgrmystr2,that's great
28-08-2018T00:31:15,unsteddyphoenix,I guess tahts cool too
28-08-2018T00:31:30,Ordithus,I actually have no guns.  Not interested.  I do have my bow.
28-08-2018T00:31:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Using a gun to shave is cool but have you guys tried waxing?

28-08-2018T00:32:25,SpazztasticKiwi,id get my legs waxed out of curiosity once but. Takes time. Expensive

28-08-2018T00:34:39,unsteddyphoenix,Also why doesnt everyone have a gun hole
28-08-2018T00:34:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Everyone should try waxing at least once though I’ve heard the same about taxing and pepper spray

28-08-2018T01:24:20,Bgrmystr2,:u
28-08-2018T01:24:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Or doing a mad sketch dash
28-08-2018T01:30:30,Dadrobit,Just angrily scribbling on his wacom.

28-08-2018T01:35:39,unsteddyphoenix,Several teabags. More flavour = better ive learnt

28-08-2018T01:38:09,SpazztasticKiwi,That sounds so many shades of unpleasant
28-08-2018T01:38:16,unsteddyphoenix,Cursed video

28-08-2018T01:39:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Calm with evenly dispersed spurts of insanity
28-08-2018T01:39:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Sounds like an artist
28-08-2018T01:43:30,Dadrobit,"Such is the life of an uncle with young nieces and nephews. Sleepovers means MLP marathons in the living room sometimes. And the odd text message of, ""Have you seen this fan video Uncle Daddy?"""
28-08-2018T01:44:53,SpazztasticKiwi,“Uncle Daddy”
28-08-2018T01:45:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I think that’s the sign I need to go to bed
28-08-2018T01:45:52,Dadrobit,Only one of my nieces does that. She's roughly 85% sass I think.
28-08-2018T01:46:24,Dadrobit,The others are too young to get it.
28-08-2018T01:46:28,unsteddyphoenix,Im worried about the 15
28-08-2018T01:46:58,SpazztasticKiwi,15% young
28-08-2018T01:47:14,Dadrobit,The other 15 is gossip and angst.
28-08-2018T01:47:25,Bgrmystr2,I don't know really anyone made of even 30% sass
28-08-2018T01:47:28,Bgrmystr2,it's really sad.
28-08-2018T01:47:35,Bgrmystr2,cuz I love that kinda shit
28-08-2018T01:47:43,Bgrmystr2,and literally noone I meet is like that.
28-08-2018T01:47:45,Bgrmystr2,ever.
28-08-2018T01:47:52,Dadrobit,"She's so much like my sister, it's actually unreal."
28-08-2018T01:48:00,Dadrobit,Funny how family works like that.
28-08-2018T01:48:11,unsteddyphoenix,That IS funny
28-08-2018T01:48:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve met people like that. Physical embodiments of a wet blanket
28-08-2018T01:48:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m about 90-95% my dad
28-08-2018T01:48:49,Dadrobit,"Nah, she's funny sass. Not ""fuck you, I got mine"" sass."
28-08-2018T01:49:33,Dadrobit,"Thank goodness. Her mother was ""fuck you, I got mine"" growing up. I recall that well."
28-08-2018T01:53:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"From what I’ve seen, younger siblings tend to take a more social role, or at least be a smidge more adventurous"
28-08-2018T01:54:17,unsteddyphoenix,This is not the case for me
28-08-2018T01:54:31,SpazztasticKiwi,“From what I’ve seen”
28-08-2018T01:54:46,SpazztasticKiwi,A few examples. I know it’s easily swapped
28-08-2018T01:55:04,Dadrobit,"Big same. I'm the second youngest, and I feel that most all of my siblings do more shit than me."
28-08-2018T01:55:37,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering: I still wonder what life would have been like if my sister were still here.
28-08-2018T01:55:54,Bgrmystr2,I'm kinda jealous.
28-08-2018T01:55:56,Bgrmystr2,:/
28-08-2018T01:56:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’m more social than my sister but if I’m done talking or have something else to do, you’ll not get much more out of me"
28-08-2018T01:56:18,Dadrobit,"Not that I don't do stuff, I like to think that I'm on a good track, but like, growing up, and even now I feel that probably 4 or 5 out of 6 of my siblings are doing more or doing better off than myself."
28-08-2018T01:57:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m also not one to look directly at you in a conversation unless I’m interested or very comfortable with you
28-08-2018T01:57:21,Dadrobit,"(3 step siblings, 3 half siblings)"
28-08-2018T01:57:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Good luck finding out which one
28-08-2018T01:58:07,unsteddyphoenix,Im more social than my younger sister.
28-08-2018T01:58:12,unsteddyphoenix,ME.
28-08-2018T01:58:48,Dadrobit,I think I'm middle of the pack in going out and being social. But I know for a fact that I have the best social skills.
28-08-2018T01:59:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Used to want a brother. Probably not in the cards anymore
28-08-2018T01:59:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"My sister and I aren’t even that social with each other. Birthday presents are “go to store. Oh, she’ll like that. But it. And here.”"
28-08-2018T02:00:00,Dadrobit,"On second thought, I'm probably lower in the pack for going out and being social, but still top dog in socializing."
28-08-2018T02:00:02,SpazztasticKiwi,*Buy
28-08-2018T02:01:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"Like when Jacksepticeye has his partnership thing with Marvel, I got the loot box. She got the Marvel stuff. I got the JSE stuff."
28-08-2018T02:01:14,SpazztasticKiwi,*had
28-08-2018T02:01:32,Dadrobit,My brother and I just buy more and more outrageous sex toys for each other every year. Literally 7 years running of this shit back and forth.
28-08-2018T02:02:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not surprised
28-08-2018T02:02:55,unsteddyphoenix,Whats the latest purchase?
28-08-2018T02:03:00,Dadrobit,Thank goodness for Bad Dragon.

28-08-2018T02:03:43,Dadrobit,"Lemme check, I think it was the dragon muzzle one. I forget the name."
28-08-2018T02:05:37,Dadrobit,Duke's Muzzle. I shoulda been able to remember that tbh.
28-08-2018T02:05:53,unsteddyphoenix,...muzzle?
28-08-2018T02:05:57,unsteddyphoenix,Seeya
28-08-2018T02:06:22,SpazztasticKiwi,For the record I was kidding. It’s why there’s no spaces
28-08-2018T02:06:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"As an unrelated note, try looking in the back room of Spencer’s"
28-08-2018T02:07:24,SpazztasticKiwi,You can make a full on birthday party for him in all it’s phallic glory
28-08-2018T02:08:32,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/TSw2j02.png Shit's expensive brah. No money to spend on a whole party.
28-08-2018T02:09:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I know. But even just one thing is a big “why does this exist”
28-08-2018T02:09:46,Bgrmystr2,Do.. I even want to know how big it is?
28-08-2018T02:10:06,SpazztasticKiwi,That depends on how far your curiosity goes
28-08-2018T02:10:30,Bgrmystr2,I'm a curious bastard and it's gotten me into way more trouble than it's worth
28-08-2018T02:10:33,Bgrmystr2,but I can't stop
28-08-2018T02:10:38,Dadrobit,8 inches in length
28-08-2018T02:10:43,Bgrmystr2,"so yeah, I'm 55% on the side of wanna know."
28-08-2018T02:10:44,Bgrmystr2,and damn
28-08-2018T02:11:25,Dadrobit,"Oh, and I know about the back half of Spencer's."
28-08-2018T02:13:15,SpazztasticKiwi,They’re supposed to ask for id before they let you go back there but I was never asked
28-08-2018T02:13:45,Dadrobit,"Also, holy damn they've dropped it in price. Only $95 base now. I feel swindled."
28-08-2018T02:13:48,SpazztasticKiwi,And they usually have it in an actual back room. The place I saw didn’t even have a curtain
28-08-2018T02:14:20,unsteddyphoenix,Im more curious about the width
28-08-2018T02:14:36,unsteddyphoenix,"Maybe, shockingly, it didnt see well"
28-08-2018T02:14:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I just really like browsing the shirts and mugs. Hard to do when those shelves are just to the side staring you down
28-08-2018T02:16:29,unsteddyphoenix,"The mugs are sold next to the ""toys""?"
28-08-2018T02:16:34,unsteddyphoenix,What is this mystical land
28-08-2018T02:16:35,Dadrobit,The Diameter of the shaft is 3.6 inches.

28-08-2018T02:17:44,unsteddyphoenix,How is that even physically possible
28-08-2018T02:17:59,unsteddyphoenix,Are there aesthetic collectors 'cause I cant imagine anyone using that
28-08-2018T02:18:22,Dadrobit,"I mean, you don't put it in you, other way around."
28-08-2018T02:18:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"Believe it or not, there’s fedishes for everything"

28-08-2018T02:20:08,Dadrobit,"Nah, they sell everything."
28-08-2018T02:20:11,Dadrobit,Even mugs
28-08-2018T02:20:41,unsteddyphoenix,Huh.

28-08-2018T02:20:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Gotta appeal to everyone
28-08-2018T02:20:49,Dadrobit,"Hoodies, records, coloring books."
28-08-2018T02:21:16,unsteddyphoenix,I dont know whether to react to records or colouring books.
28-08-2018T02:21:48,Dadrobit,"Their music is actually funny as fuck, not gonna lie."
28-08-2018T02:22:02,unsteddyphoenix,What...genre?
28-08-2018T02:22:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"Just having the internet, there’s things I know are out there and exist that I wish I didn’t know of, but if it’s your thing..."
28-08-2018T02:22:31,DarthRexKing,Goodnight.
28-08-2018T02:22:32,Dadrobit,50's rock. Like the stuff you hear in Fallout.

28-08-2018T02:26:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"You apparently get a lot of it online, but there’s also the challenge of “what three things can I get together to weird/gross out the cashier the most?”"
28-08-2018T02:27:00,Dadrobit,"A Jar of mayonaise, a condom, a bible, and a stopwatch."
28-08-2018T02:27:09,unsteddyphoenix,that can get out of hand very quickly
28-08-2018T02:27:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Three
28-08-2018T02:27:41,Dadrobit,A mayonnaise flavored condom then.
28-08-2018T02:28:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m scared to find out but does that even exist? I know strawberry ones do but
28-08-2018T02:28:29,unsteddyphoenix,"Also is there a ""hot and spicy"" varient"
28-08-2018T02:28:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m sure there is. God help you if you put it on inside out
28-08-2018T02:29:04,Dadrobit,And Bacon flavored is definitely a thing.

28-08-2018T12:28:40,CrimsonQuill,I get that too. I hate it when it does that.
28-08-2018T12:34:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Though why didn’t you ask Alexa how to spell it
28-08-2018T12:34:37,CrimsonQuill,I just use a dictionary.
28-08-2018T12:34:42,CrimsonQuill,it's easier.
28-08-2018T12:50:11,ferociousfox,I just wanna sleep :ptv-sleepy:
28-08-2018T12:54:17,Twokinds,I didn't think about it
28-08-2018T13:06:24,Dadrobit,:/ Went out to the local admissions office to appeal a grade I got over my summer course. Printed out all the evidence I had collected of my conversations with the professor and the grades that I received that were below par.
28-08-2018T13:06:52,Dadrobit,"I get into the office, and when I begin the appeal process, ""Oh, looks like they changed you to an A."""
28-08-2018T13:07:39,Dadrobit,"I'm just sitting there with all of the papers from only an hour before showing my lower grade, when suddenly everything is corrected mid-appeal."
28-08-2018T13:07:50,Dadrobit,Well heck.
28-08-2018T13:08:11,Twokinds,lol
28-08-2018T13:09:13,Dadrobit,"""I'd just roll with it dude. Gratz on the A."""
28-08-2018T13:09:19,Dadrobit,"""Thanks? I guess?"""
28-08-2018T13:10:09,Dadrobit,And with that awkward interaction. I am officially done with college.

28-08-2018T17:35:29,SpazztasticKiwi,They’ve kind of started a new thing at our McDonald’s where they bring you your tray when it’s ready and will get you your ketchup or whatever for you too. Not sure how to respond to this
28-08-2018T17:36:40,Twokinds,That's kinda weird.
28-08-2018T17:37:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"Like the other day I was getting my drink and the kid was ~right behind~ me when I turned back around. Like, it’s nice but chill"
28-08-2018T17:41:36,Foxpie,the mcds do that hear if you want them too
28-08-2018T17:42:04,Foxpie,been a thing for a while
28-08-2018T17:43:15,Bgrmystr2,do they not just call out your name when it's ready and you go get your tray at the counter...?
28-08-2018T17:43:20,Bgrmystr2,like.. normal
28-08-2018T17:47:56,SpazztasticKiwi,They’ll call your number but you can’t get up without them running into you mid step
28-08-2018T17:48:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Aggressive customer service
28-08-2018T17:48:39,Foxpie,"they take it they take it to table if you like, just need to tell them what coloure part of the mcds you in"
28-08-2018T17:49:11,SpazztasticKiwi,We don’t have color areas in our McDonald’s. It’s all grey and white
28-08-2018T17:49:34,Foxpie,its just a sign that is the coloure the rest is white and green
28-08-2018T17:50:02,Foxpie,but it means there are less tables to ask is this your food to i guess
28-08-2018T17:50:31,CrRAR,There should be a section for the old fashioned experience.
28-08-2018T17:51:07,Foxpie,you can you are asked
28-08-2018T17:51:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"My thing is that I know I can get my own stuff, and I know they have better things to do. The service is perfect for the elderly and multiple tray orders that come in but not me, really"
28-08-2018T17:52:33,SpazztasticKiwi,My only other guess is that they see me so much and I used to work there
28-08-2018T18:03:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"Whatever it is, it exists. Back later :ctwokinds-nibsbounce:"

28-08-2018T21:40:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I had a slice
28-08-2018T21:41:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Too much icing
28-08-2018T21:41:14,SpazztasticKiwi,But good chocolate
28-08-2018T21:42:35,Ordithus,Send me a slice

28-08-2018T21:46:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Chocolate 🍫
28-08-2018T21:46:50,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s to account for the icing since there’s no emoji for that

28-08-2018T21:54:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Is there a difference between icing and frosting
28-08-2018T21:57:01,Dadrobit,"icing is more sugar based and dense. Often used as a thin layer to cover the cake. Frosting is a fluffyer, often butter based topping that is used more decoratively."
28-08-2018T21:57:29,Dadrobit,fluffier*?
28-08-2018T21:59:08,Dadrobit,I feel like baking a cake tonight now.
28-08-2018T22:02:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel like becoming a human burrito with my blankets cause it’s cold
28-08-2018T22:45:46,Twokinds,"mmm, human burrito"
28-08-2018T22:46:05,Twokinds,"mmm, burrito"

28-08-2018T22:48:13,Twokinds,"I had burrito in a can earlier, but it's not the same."
28-08-2018T22:48:59,unsteddyphoenix,Thats not real.
28-08-2018T22:50:06,Twokinds,Burrito soup
28-08-2018T22:50:18,unsteddyphoenix,Hmmmmm
28-08-2018T22:50:33,Ordithus,Tortilla soup?
28-08-2018T22:50:55,unsteddyphoenix,Taco soup would be easier to eat
28-08-2018T22:51:17,Ordithus,"Nah, chimichanga soup is better"
28-08-2018T22:54:38,unsteddyphoenix,Can you get burritos delivered?
28-08-2018T23:06:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Uhh. “Human burrito”?
28-08-2018T23:06:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Should I be concerned
28-08-2018T23:08:41,SpazztasticKiwi,You always seem to be hungry. Do you not have regular meals
28-08-2018T23:25:03,Twokinds,human-sized burrito
28-08-2018T23:25:17,Twokinds,"unfortunately, no one delivers burritos near me"
28-08-2018T23:25:26,Twokinds,It's too late anyway.

28-08-2018T23:30:18,unsteddyphoenix,We aren't living in future until I can get a burrito to my doorstep at any time

28-08-2018T23:49:57,Twokinds,Drivers aren't really out after 10 or so around here.
28-08-2018T23:50:07,Twokinds,I don't live in a city.

28-08-2018T23:52:40,unsteddyphoenix,All the little conviniences~
28-08-2018T23:53:16,unsteddyphoenix,Couldnt someone just run a semi-legal resteraunt through ubereats?
28-08-2018T23:53:26,unsteddyphoenix,Like how ubers are semi-legal taxis? :thinking:
28-08-2018T23:54:23,Ordithus,"Aww, uber eats isn't in my city"
28-08-2018T23:54:33,Bgrmystr2,"""semi-legal"" they're not illegal, technically. Fundamentally, Taxi services have a monopoly, and that's illegal."
28-08-2018T23:54:53,Bgrmystr2,"but cuz they have so much power, they can push Uber around, or attempt to"
28-08-2018T23:55:13,Bgrmystr2,so if anything Uber's existance is what's the most legal thing vs taxis to begin with
28-08-2018T23:55:41,Bgrmystr2,lotta ppl don't understand that and just want more moniez
28-08-2018T23:57:46,Mippy,"What's Uber?....Naw, I kid. I'm just pretty sure they don't exist in my areea"
28-08-2018T23:58:11,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, monopolies aren't very regulated, even in the US."
28-08-2018T23:58:33,Bgrmystr2,many of em get away with it due to technicalities and loopholes
