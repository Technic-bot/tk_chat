11-08-2018T15:04:05,ThingsAreMoving,Only if you can guarantee that next time you'll not go over 10 minutes
11-08-2018T15:04:06,BadFoMo,@JamesBSquirrel3 I think so.
11-08-2018T15:04:42,TorqueEmUp,I wonder what Tom has in mind this week.
11-08-2018T15:05:03,ferociousfox,maybe hes getting it prepared? thats why he said 5 / 10 min
11-08-2018T15:05:07,Combak,It is a mystery.
11-08-2018T15:05:08,FenceEqualizer,Deal!

11-08-2018T15:05:22,JamesBSquirrel3,"Okay - let hold on the second, before Tom reponds if he's ready."

11-08-2018T15:06:19,TerraTheWizard,"mix it up crazy stile, combine the two winning votes for each poll into one sketch"
11-08-2018T15:06:23,TerraTheWizard,*style

11-08-2018T15:06:43,ThingsAreMoving,loosers will be winners - draw the least voted suggestion
11-08-2018T15:07:08,ThingsAreMoving,stream mutators would be fun methinks
11-08-2018T15:07:18,JamesBSquirrel3,"We don't know expect due in, you know."
11-08-2018T15:07:34,BadFoMo,@ThingsAreMoving Maybe mine would win then.

11-08-2018T15:16:17,DarthKeidran,@Twokinds I kind of like this method of voting personally
11-08-2018T15:16:21,Twokinds,You don't have to use it if you don't want to.
11-08-2018T15:16:28,JamesBSquirrel3,I Pick those two ...

11-08-2018T15:16:42,Xexanoth,they both have different advantage/disadvantages
11-08-2018T15:16:46,MallardDuckAvia,I hope Sealeen wins
11-08-2018T15:16:55,DarthKeidran,"@Twokinds are you doing the tkpolls also, or doing this one week as an experiment?"
11-08-2018T15:16:58,SiliconCarbide,so the google one is just for curiosity?
11-08-2018T15:17:09,Combak,So it seems.
11-08-2018T15:17:15,JamesBSquirrel3,"1) Kat & Raine, and 2) Raine/Rose AU..."
11-08-2018T15:17:15,MviluUatusun,It's a new way of voting.  How does it work?  Do we just pick one we like or do we pick multiples?
11-08-2018T15:17:16,casher500,Welp if my pc didn't just crash i would vote
11-08-2018T15:17:27,Combak,"It might replace tkpolls if there's some interesting differences, I presume."
11-08-2018T15:17:29,FuryFaZeFurry,hello!
11-08-2018T15:17:36,Ordithus,"The new thing is an experiment, if I'm understanding right"

11-08-2018T15:17:47,BadFoMo,@Twokinds ...So which ones won in this 'test'?
11-08-2018T15:17:50,Combak,"Mvilu, it says up to 7."

11-08-2018T15:17:55,Combak,So the 7 you like the most.

11-08-2018T15:18:47,HobbitGames,"Is anybody else seeing a flashing picarto logo, or is that in the stream?"
11-08-2018T15:18:50,Combak,Then someone keeps putting it in.
11-08-2018T15:19:01,Ordithus,"That means you are buffering, Hobbit"
11-08-2018T15:19:02,markoatonc,"I think it is designed as first tier of selection. which I think is great idea, it used to be that all choices in pool were of sililar theme and things like that, this way we get to showe what we are going to be choosing from :D"

11-08-2018T15:21:33,ferociousfox,IRL male but eric paints him as female
11-08-2018T15:21:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Eric with the bias XD

11-08-2018T15:22:13,MuonNeutrino,i dont like 'let's embarrass fem mike' but i have to admit eric wouldn't be interested in painting him otherwise XD
11-08-2018T15:22:20,FenceEqualizer,Poor Kat is going to end up as the happy little tree in the far background of erics painting

11-08-2018T15:25:03,DarthKeidran,"@Twokinds Can you post the ""test results"" on patreon? And if you think that voting for everything together works better, perhaps next week you can try making a test poll on tkpolls.com that has everything, do the top 4 ""winners"" and then pick the rest."
11-08-2018T15:25:04,Tharkis,"figured with it getting 3rd one week it'd do well again the next, and then no one voted for it =D"
11-08-2018T15:25:09,Ordithus,This is where Mike discovers his calling as a male model

11-08-2018T15:26:22,DarthKeidran,@TerraTheWizard that's why giving a longer waiting time would work better.

11-08-2018T15:27:33,Twokinds,How am I going to draw any of them if I wait until it's over
11-08-2018T15:27:42,ProsePro7,Is it just me or is the music quiet?
11-08-2018T15:27:44,Twokinds,Don't worry about it okay?

11-08-2018T15:38:58,Ordithus,It just gets confusing
11-08-2018T15:39:02,CrRAR,Maybe he traded his heart butt for this situation and now is regretting his decisions.

11-08-2018T16:50:42,TomatoBasket,Clovis does not simply have A saber. He has as many as he wants and more than you can afford.
11-08-2018T16:50:51,MuonNeutrino,@Xexanoth ten minutes of podracing does not make up for the rest of that movie heh
11-08-2018T16:50:55,unsteddyphoenix,and prequel and sequel warring fan factions create a risky alliance...
11-08-2018T16:51:02,eric190,heyo
11-08-2018T16:51:10,Xexanoth,@Muon the rest of the movies wasn'T worse than that ewok shit
11-08-2018T16:51:12,Bespin,Phantom menace is BAD
11-08-2018T16:51:21,MuonNeutrino,"@ZahnHolley I thought it was good, just don't go into it expecting the same sort of 'galaxy spanning epic' sort of usual star wars thing. it's a star wars heist movie, but a good one IMO"
11-08-2018T16:51:21,ProsePro7,The prequals were good screw you fight me
11-08-2018T16:51:24,ThingsAreMoving,"unfteddy, that's common for people to unite against a common enemy"
11-08-2018T16:51:27,Bespin,But revenge of the sith rocks
11-08-2018T16:51:31,HeresyArtStream,The prequels were okay.
11-08-2018T16:51:35,Katfeathers,that's why he started with 4
11-08-2018T16:51:36,unsteddyphoenix,Now THIS is podracing
11-08-2018T16:51:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
11-08-2018T16:51:50,FenceEqualizer,Prequels were decent enough
11-08-2018T16:51:51,Russianconservative,Threatened by soloists who seek dominance over the star wars fandom.
11-08-2018T16:51:51,HeresyArtStream,The Last Jedi is vandalism
11-08-2018T16:51:52,MuonNeutrino,"@Xexanoth the difference is that episode 1 was a terrible movie with one neat sequence, RotJ was a good movie with one questionable sequence &gt;.&gt;"
11-08-2018T16:51:53,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, the race was my favorite part of that movie"
11-08-2018T16:51:57,Bgrmystr2,everything else was meh

11-08-2018T18:52:12,RimaDraws,how about baking
11-08-2018T18:52:12,NeonMitsumi,"Oh, wait, that's Raine's speciality."
11-08-2018T18:52:15,Bgrmystr2,Literally the sims. They cook. They burn the whole kitchen. The whole house catches fire. Everyone dies.
11-08-2018T18:52:15,Issus,I guess you don't normally make one at a time though.
11-08-2018T18:52:20,MuonNeutrino,"actually, who suggested this one? they ought to get to pick XD"
11-08-2018T18:52:21,DarthKeidran,Time to see if everyone in TwoKinds except Rose are terrible cooks.
11-08-2018T18:52:21,Bgrmystr2,That's what I'd want.
11-08-2018T18:52:22,InTheLionsDen,Pizza delivery

11-08-2018T18:52:58,unsteddyphoenix,He might mean the Kat and Raine one
11-08-2018T18:53:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,W0lfy has the right idea
11-08-2018T18:53:08,NeonMitsumi,"""I already did that."" You did a lot of things more than once. :V"
11-08-2018T18:53:16,MuonNeutrino,"or maybe natani never learned to cook properly losing her family so young, and keith is teaching him?"
11-08-2018T18:53:21,DarthKeidran,Ok. Good point @unsteddyphoenix
11-08-2018T18:53:22,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe they could be chefs in a resteraunt kitchen?
11-08-2018T18:53:24,Twokinds,Yeah but the sims cooking is pretty specific
11-08-2018T18:53:28,Ordithus,Natani is a cooking protege
11-08-2018T18:53:49,Ordithus,He finally finds something he's good at
11-08-2018T18:53:54,unsteddyphoenix,lol
11-08-2018T18:53:54,DarthKeidran,How about Natani is cooking a new drug. Mana
11-08-2018T18:54:00,w0lfmare,It'd be fun to have something with barbaric Natani and by-the-book Keith
11-08-2018T18:54:00,Bgrmystr2,xD put smoke everywhere
11-08-2018T18:54:02,DarthKeidran,Breaking Bad style
11-08-2018T18:54:03,Bgrmystr2,call it done
11-08-2018T18:54:06,HobbitGames,Are we ever going to see anything of the assassins brotherhood?
11-08-2018T18:54:13,RimaDraws,so they just burn the kitchen down
11-08-2018T18:54:16,w0lfmare,Since that's a broader idea
11-08-2018T18:54:21,unsteddyphoenix,Keith getting annoyed with Natani for making a mess in the kitchen
11-08-2018T18:54:24,NeonMitsumi,"Whatever you make, some people will always complain it's KANDAT"
11-08-2018T18:54:26,unsteddyphoenix,REAL relationship shit
11-08-2018T18:54:31,Zdziwionykot,Breaking Bad but is Zen and Nat
11-08-2018T18:54:39,Afallingtree,Having a sword fight with stuff lying around the kitchen
11-08-2018T18:54:55,unsteddyphoenix,lol i like that
11-08-2018T18:55:03,unsteddyphoenix,Cooking devolves into food fight
11-08-2018T18:55:11,Afallingtree,Lol yeah

11-08-2018T18:55:28,BadFoMo,"Keith: ...How, did it get, on the ceiling?"
11-08-2018T18:55:31,ThingsAreMoving,Not fun if hot food is involved
11-08-2018T18:55:46,DarthKeidran,If they were Cooking Mana I guess this sketch could be called Breaking Nat
11-08-2018T18:55:49,unsteddyphoenix,that just makes it h a r d c o r e
11-08-2018T18:55:55,Mippy,Hz

11-08-2018T20:49:40,MuonNeutrino,"well, WWII pinup didn't actually win its separate vote"
11-08-2018T20:49:41,Twokinds,I did WWII PinUp from the combined poll
11-08-2018T20:49:47,Bgrmystr2,"where was unboob me, Tom?"

11-08-2018T20:50:24,Twokinds,UNBOOB ME got 13 votes
11-08-2018T20:50:37,RimaDraws,i guess im kinda okay with mine being 11 votes in the first round sixth place
11-08-2018T20:50:38,Twokinds,Which puts it in the upper quarter of votes
11-08-2018T20:50:40,CrRAR,\o/
11-08-2018T20:50:41,unsteddyphoenix,I wouldve voted for it if I wasnt half asleep at the time
11-08-2018T20:50:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,\o/
11-08-2018T20:50:43,Bgrmystr2,oh nice
11-08-2018T20:50:46,Ordithus,Maren x Raine?
11-08-2018T20:50:47,Bgrmystr2,one of those votes was mine!
11-08-2018T20:50:49,CrimsonHelsing,"Sleep well Tom, and thanks for another awesome stream as always! See you Friday or so!"
11-08-2018T20:50:58,FenceEqualizer,I...want to ask how many mines got bit the numbers scare me
11-08-2018T20:51:00,Combak,"Interestingly, Human!Kat won the very first round of voting with 12 votes..."
11-08-2018T20:51:20,Combak,But the Keith and Alaric Nude Beach won it's first round by 15.
11-08-2018T20:51:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Daddy Alaric when?
11-08-2018T20:51:44,Combak,I guess a few of those votes didn't transfer when there were so many options.
11-08-2018T20:52:02,Combak,And such a limited number of ones you could vote for.
11-08-2018T20:52:05,FenceEqualizer,"With how the voting goes. In a month or two, Marv"
11-08-2018T20:52:07,RimaDraws,wonder where mine stood in the actual google doc vote
11-08-2018T20:52:16,Combak,Which one was it?
11-08-2018T20:52:18,Twokinds,Maren x Raine got 9 votes
11-08-2018T20:52:30,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
11-08-2018T20:52:51,BadFoMo,Oh what the heck. How many votes did Suddenly Tails 2 get.
11-08-2018T20:52:56,RimaDraws,mine was the fem clovis body pillow
11-08-2018T20:53:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,mine was unboob me
11-08-2018T20:53:18,Combak,So Marv's did well.
11-08-2018T20:53:21,FenceEqualizer,You're up there Marv ^^
11-08-2018T20:53:23,Bgrmystr2,sooo how many votes did Human Kat get?
11-08-2018T20:53:24,CrRAR,lol clovis would probably still look agitated as a pillow
11-08-2018T20:53:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,^^
11-08-2018T20:53:29,Bgrmystr2,as a #1 vote
11-08-2018T20:53:31,RimaDraws,yea stupid idea
11-08-2018T20:53:52,FenceEqualizer,"Going to ask, how many did the Basitin Spice one get Tom?"
11-08-2018T20:53:53,CrRAR,"""NO! NO SNUGGLES!"""
11-08-2018T20:53:55,Ordithus,"I dunno, Clovis has embraced the good looks in many of the recent sketches"
11-08-2018T20:53:58,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake:
11-08-2018T20:54:00,Bgrmystr2,It's doin okay marv lol
11-08-2018T20:54:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Gonna keep rolling with it
11-08-2018T20:54:28,FenceEqualizer,A daki pillow that looks like it doesn't want to be touched lol
11-08-2018T20:54:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Its about time we bring a old meme to life
11-08-2018T20:54:34,Twokinds,I don't know
11-08-2018T20:54:36,RimaDraws,yea i dont think that idea of mine would succeed...
11-08-2018T20:54:42,CrRAR,hahaha
11-08-2018T20:54:47,Twokinds,It's very hard to find what a specific one does because the way google displays data
11-08-2018T20:54:54,DarthKeidran,How did the experiment go @twokinds?
11-08-2018T20:54:56,Twokinds,It requires hovering over a bar to see what it represents
11-08-2018T20:55:08,Ordithus,"Weird, how very un-user-friendly"
11-08-2018T20:55:13,FenceEqualizer,Well crap.Hahah.
11-08-2018T20:55:26,Combak,"Evidently, the voting on Google pretty accurately reflected the winners."
11-08-2018T20:55:52,Twokinds,I don't know why it doesn't label the bars
11-08-2018T20:55:53,FenceEqualizer,Ahh well just going to keep trying. May have to sacrifice poor Muscle Head for a more well known character
11-08-2018T20:55:57,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah that's weird
11-08-2018T20:56:05,CrRAR,spooky
11-08-2018T20:56:05,unsteddyphoenix,But I love him~
11-08-2018T20:56:06,Bgrmystr2,"well, it is google"
11-08-2018T20:56:15,CrRAR,tru
11-08-2018T20:56:19,unsteddyphoenix,Tom's been into drawing buff boys recently maybe he'll pick musclehead
11-08-2018T20:56:20,CrRAR,&lt;.&lt;'
11-08-2018T20:56:26,Bgrmystr2,"anycase, gonna brb"
11-08-2018T20:56:39,Fatmanfalling,do the suggestions that don't get picked carry over to next weeks voting pool?
11-08-2018T20:56:42,RimaDraws,ill just try something different next week. but im glad i got to watch the stream
11-08-2018T20:56:42,Twokinds,Suddenly Tails 2 got 9 votes
11-08-2018T20:56:58,CrRAR,that's... okay
11-08-2018T20:57:01,unsteddyphoenix,No you have to request again each week
11-08-2018T20:57:02,FenceEqualizer,Maybe i'll throw something outlandish to get attention. The commercials where known to be explosive
11-08-2018T20:57:11,unsteddyphoenix,What about the friendfiction one?
11-08-2018T20:57:11,Twokinds,You submit suggestions every week
11-08-2018T20:57:16,Fatmanfalling,thanks
11-08-2018T20:57:18,Twokinds,You can change it or keep it the same
11-08-2018T20:57:34,BadFoMo,Holy Crap! That's the most it's ever gotten!
11-08-2018T20:57:39,Ordithus,I'm thinking male Mike needs some love
11-08-2018T20:57:48,Twokinds,"If you're picked, you get put on a 1 week cooldown."
11-08-2018T20:58:30,FenceEqualizer,"Oh, that's generous, Tom. Thought it was longer."
11-08-2018T20:58:44,BadFoMo,@Twokinds Thanks for looking that up for me.
11-08-2018T20:59:22,RimaDraws,oh if i had gotten picked i wouldnt have suggested till another month or whenever
11-08-2018T20:59:26,RimaDraws,thats kinda cool
11-08-2018T21:01:05,MarshallMelon,Could've sworn the cooldown used to be a month but the last time it was mentioned was like a year ago so whatever
11-08-2018T21:01:06,DarthKeidran,"@twokinds does that mean I’m on a one week cooldown since that last sketch was like my comment on ghost Laura? If so, oh man!"
11-08-2018T21:01:37,Combak,I really doubt it.
11-08-2018T21:01:46,TheDogKing,:}
11-08-2018T21:01:49,DarthKeidran,I know. Who suggested it?
11-08-2018T21:02:05,Twokinds,Dunno
11-08-2018T21:02:09,DarthKeidran,The recording doesn’t show tom write that.
11-08-2018T21:02:09,Twokinds,Tired now
11-08-2018T21:02:26,FenceEqualizer,"Sleep calls for thee, do not fight it"
11-08-2018T21:02:31,RimaDraws,go sleep tom
11-08-2018T21:02:39,RimaDraws,get a pillow and your comforter and sleep
11-08-2018T21:02:40,DarthKeidran,that’s fine. It’s been a long stream. Look it up when you’re getting ready to post it.
11-08-2018T21:02:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Sleep is good
11-08-2018T21:02:50,Combak,Go to bed Tom!
11-08-2018T21:02:56,Combak,Have a good rest.
11-08-2018T21:02:56,unsteddyphoenix,Tom I order you to do what you want to do.
11-08-2018T21:03:11,FenceEqualizer,Or play a relaxing game of Dark souls to lull you to sleep

11-08-2018T21:47:59,Dadrobit,Flat is justice tbh.
11-08-2018T21:48:24,Bgrmystr2,Gonna big disagree with that.

11-08-2018T21:49:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,all must be cherished and protected
11-08-2018T21:49:39,Dadrobit,"Look, if it is so big that it no longer completely fits in the hand, then the rest of it is just going to waste. IJS."
11-08-2018T21:49:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless they’re sculpted in an operating room
11-08-2018T21:49:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,get bigger hands
11-08-2018T21:49:55,Dadrobit,Also back problems for days.
11-08-2018T21:49:58,Ordithus,Or two hands
11-08-2018T21:49:59,FenceEqualizer,That's why god gave us two hands
11-08-2018T21:50:03,Ordithus,lol Fence
11-08-2018T21:50:04,Bgrmystr2,sounds like a hand problem rather than a boob problem.

11-08-2018T21:51:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Then it’s more of a row boat

11-08-2018T21:54:06,SpazztasticKiwi,TOo easy to see that
11-08-2018T21:54:34,FenceEqualizer,But that's when you get all the fun and very confusing mistakes
11-08-2018T21:55:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Let us not speak of the past but look to the future
11-08-2018T21:56:10,Dadrobit,My future involves getting a sleeping kitten out of my lap.

11-08-2018T21:57:03,Bgrmystr2,I never saw the point of spellcheck. I've never used it and it's always hindered me more than helped me every time I did run across something that had it enabled.
11-08-2018T21:57:13,Bgrmystr2,do not want.
11-08-2018T21:57:22,Ordithus,Spellcheck is fine.  Autocorrect can die in a fire
11-08-2018T21:57:26,Bgrmystr2,I just kinda.. learn how to spell shit.
11-08-2018T21:57:37,Bgrmystr2,and then I don't gotta worry about it :)

11-08-2018T22:13:24,unsteddyphoenix,Wow that's bad parenting
11-08-2018T22:13:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I tell Kiwi she’s the good child all the time

11-08-2018T22:13:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Sumo is a bitch, pan is a razor blade, and miles gave birth to sumo"
11-08-2018T22:13:49,Ordithus,No wonder Bagheera knocks stuff around
11-08-2018T22:14:04,Dadrobit,"Didn't plan on having a cat. Bro just brought one to me from a fire station he was volunteering at and was like, ""Here, this is yours now. Feel happy."""
11-08-2018T22:14:15,SpazztasticKiwi,“Here - have a cat”
11-08-2018T22:14:25,Ordithus,I'd have a cat if I had only encountered him two days earlier...
11-08-2018T22:14:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera’s favorite thing is harassing his sister
11-08-2018T22:14:34,unsteddyphoenix,"""You love this now."""
11-08-2018T22:14:44,unsteddyphoenix,Saddest story I ever heard ord
11-08-2018T22:14:46,Ordithus,I signed a lease for my current apartment two days before I met the most adorable little guy on the street
11-08-2018T22:14:46,Dadrobit,"""I guess I own a cat now."""
11-08-2018T22:15:14,SpazztasticKiwi,If I remember right I believe Tom said that’s basically what happened to him
11-08-2018T22:15:17,Ordithus,"I brought him to the humane society, I'm certain he was adopted right away"
11-08-2018T22:15:47,Ordithus,He's made some family happy
11-08-2018T22:16:43,Ordithus,As I was driving around he sat in my lap.  When I would stop he'd sit up and boop my nose with his &lt;3
11-08-2018T22:17:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Black cats don’t get adopted very fast if at all
11-08-2018T22:17:12,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh stop~ it's too sweet
11-08-2018T22:17:16,Bgrmystr2,aw
11-08-2018T22:17:28,Bgrmystr2,"that cat seemed to enjoy human company, I wonder what happened to it"
11-08-2018T22:17:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera has learned I boop his nose for amusement and he’s started doing the same to me
11-08-2018T22:18:05,Bgrmystr2,yeah cats are smart
11-08-2018T22:18:17,Ordithus,"I hope he found a good home.  I expect he was a college student's cat, and they just let him out at semester"
11-08-2018T22:18:20,Bgrmystr2,they probably think it's some kind of affection thing.
11-08-2018T22:18:26,Bgrmystr2,and that's not entirely wrong.
11-08-2018T22:18:37,Dadrobit,":/ Only thing Nyx is halfway trained to do is chill with me while I'm cooking, and watch me play pinball..."
11-08-2018T22:18:42,Bgrmystr2,that's kinda sad ord
11-08-2018T22:18:54,Ordithus,I know!  It happens all the time...
11-08-2018T22:18:57,Bgrmystr2,least they could have done was brought it to the humane society and let them find an owner or whatnot
11-08-2018T22:19:01,Bgrmystr2,tis what I'd do
11-08-2018T22:19:04,Dadrobit,But I think both of those things she'd probably just do anyways tbh.
11-08-2018T22:19:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Some people see pets as temporary
11-08-2018T22:19:24,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds like Juns Kitchen dad
11-08-2018T22:19:38,Ordithus,"Yeah, my old neighborhood had lots of dogs, raccoons, and skunks."
11-08-2018T22:19:39,Dadrobit,"Ohhh, cooking channel?"
11-08-2018T22:19:50,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah!
11-08-2018T22:19:52,Dadrobit,I fucking love cooking channels.

11-08-2018T22:20:30,unsteddyphoenix,And they chill with him and he lets them smell the ingredients

11-08-2018T22:20:59,Ordithus,Yep.  Found unsteddy's weakness.  Cats.
11-08-2018T22:21:02,Dadrobit,"Awwwwwwwww, they're so well mannered!!!"
11-08-2018T22:21:13,SpazztasticKiwi,“Is it cat-approved?” ~sniff~ “Good”
11-08-2018T22:21:21,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah! Basically that!
11-08-2018T22:21:25,Dadrobit,Nyx will dance between my legs until I give her something to sniff.
11-08-2018T22:21:37,SpazztasticKiwi,“I wanna see!!”

11-08-2018T22:22:38,unsteddyphoenix,Aw she deserves it~ &lt;3
11-08-2018T22:23:11,Dadrobit,Pardon the dirty ass floor. I swear I've swept and mopped since then lol.
11-08-2018T22:23:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Is that a floof tail?
11-08-2018T22:23:44,unsteddyphoenix,Her fur looks so sleek and shiny
11-08-2018T22:23:46,Ordithus,That's a shadow
11-08-2018T22:23:48,Dadrobit,"Nah. When she gets spooked and really floofs the tail, it's almost as thick as her body."
11-08-2018T22:23:49,unsteddyphoenix,very good very healthy
11-08-2018T22:23:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Anger Tail
11-08-2018T22:24:22,Ordithus,"One of the cats I had growing up, Molly, was practically a squirrel when she'd floof up"
11-08-2018T22:24:26,Dadrobit,"Mhmm, she gets baths. And all of her medical is up to date."
11-08-2018T22:25:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"My cats are opposites. Kiwi: good kitty, girl, very f l o o f, multi color. Bagheera: can be trouble, boy, slim fuzz, solid black"
11-08-2018T22:25:28,Dadrobit,"Also, thanks for the new channel. Subbed."
11-08-2018T22:25:54,unsteddyphoenix,Extremely wholesome man and cats can recommend
11-08-2018T22:26:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"If it’s kitty approved, it’s definitely good. Cats are hard critics you know"
11-08-2018T22:27:36,SpazztasticKiwi,And Kiwi used to be chunky but her new food’s got her slimmed down
11-08-2018T22:29:04,SpazztasticKiwi,She’s not as happy about it as I am
11-08-2018T22:29:29,Ordithus,"Hmm.  You say this, but there's lots of things cats eat I would not."
11-08-2018T22:29:42,Ordithus,And many things the other way around.
11-08-2018T22:29:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Unfortunately Kiwi is picky
11-08-2018T22:30:04,SpazztasticKiwi,She doesn’t eat raw meat or wet food
11-08-2018T22:30:22,Dadrobit,"Oof, I want to try that crab cream croquette mini recipe, but he doesn't actually list the ingredients!"
11-08-2018T22:30:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Google
11-08-2018T22:30:58,unsteddyphoenix,It might be on his website?
11-08-2018T22:32:26,Dadrobit,":( Nope, hasn't updated his site in a while it seems."
11-08-2018T22:32:55,Dadrobit,Last recipe is from a video 6 months ago.
11-08-2018T22:34:50,unsteddyphoenix,"huh, rip"
11-08-2018T22:36:20,Ordithus,"Way off topic.  I must say, I really like human Kat. :ctwokinds-KatDance:"
11-08-2018T22:36:51,unsteddyphoenix,I like it almost as much as I like regular kat! :D
11-08-2018T22:37:17,Ordithus,I like her human even more
11-08-2018T22:37:44,Ordithus,I also like human Flora... I suppose I've got some weird human fetish
11-08-2018T22:37:51,unsteddyphoenix,Thats a weird kink but I wont judge
11-08-2018T22:37:51,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
11-08-2018T22:37:54,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah
11-08-2018T22:38:17,Dadrobit,Human Kat? I missed that one.
11-08-2018T22:38:23,unsteddyphoenix,"It's nice, but it's kinda...plain compared to regular kat"
11-08-2018T22:38:51,Twokinds,I was honestly a little unsatisfied with that one. I'll be fixing it up quite a bit before posting
11-08-2018T22:38:56,Dadrobit,"Also, I am definitely trying out this crepe recipe."
11-08-2018T22:39:25,unsteddyphoenix,ooh nice~ looking forward to it
11-08-2018T22:39:31,Ordithus,Most excellent
11-08-2018T22:40:18,Dadrobit,Almost don't want to look now. I'm assuming she's dressed in some high fashion finally being a member of the superior species and having the ability to actually live out her dreams?
11-08-2018T22:40:35,Ordithus,"The highest of fashion, robit"
11-08-2018T22:40:53,unsteddyphoenix,She can wear fashion now?

11-08-2018T23:41:54,TorqueEmUp,buff Mike would look weird
11-08-2018T23:42:18,unsteddyphoenix,Even weirder than buff keith

11-08-2018T23:43:36,unsteddyphoenix,Agreed dad
11-08-2018T23:44:07,unsteddyphoenix,My biggest hurdle right now is im not eating enough :/
11-08-2018T23:44:21,unsteddyphoenix,Need p r o t e i n
11-08-2018T23:44:52,Dadrobit,Gotta get those protein shakes going!
11-08-2018T23:45:27,unsteddyphoenix,Exactly~
11-08-2018T23:45:36,unsteddyphoenix,Except I spent that money on monster hunter world oops~
11-08-2018T23:46:05,Dadrobit,S'why I like cooking so much. I have so much control over what I'm going to eat. Each dish is like a miniature power trip.
11-08-2018T23:46:15,Dadrobit,"Ohhhhh, finally."
11-08-2018T23:46:22,Dadrobit,How'd you like it?
11-08-2018T23:47:09,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah it's fun!
11-08-2018T23:47:15,TorqueEmUp,good food costs too much. :P
11-08-2018T23:47:26,unsteddyphoenix,Im not...good at it. Im stuck at a lightning lizard which everyone tells me is easy
11-08-2018T23:47:34,unsteddyphoenix,But I can see myself getting stuck in
11-08-2018T23:48:25,Dadrobit,I played the crap out of it when it came out. But had to put it aside for school and work.
11-08-2018T23:48:31,Dadrobit,Might pick it up again sometime.
11-08-2018T23:48:47,Dadrobit,But No Man's Sky is taking up my gaming slot atm.
11-08-2018T23:48:52,TorqueEmUp,Well stop soloing it and actually play with people unsteddy.
11-08-2018T23:49:12,unsteddyphoenix,But...my pride...
11-08-2018T23:50:48,TorqueEmUp,I'll eventually start playing it again... Maybe...
11-08-2018T23:51:29,TorqueEmUp,Started getting real bored once I hit the Elder Dragons
11-08-2018T23:52:05,TorqueEmUp,Which is good since that about when the game gets really grindy.
11-08-2018T23:52:30,unsteddyphoenix,Thats the point as I understand
11-08-2018T23:52:38,unsteddyphoenix,I already know im gonna be a fashion hunter
11-08-2018T23:52:46,unsteddyphoenix,My cat must be the best cat in all the land
11-08-2018T23:52:50,unsteddyphoenix,Also the cats in this game?
11-08-2018T23:53:14,Vatruvius,"Okay, can someone explain to me why a lodge in Tahoe has 17x better internet than I get and I live one minute from town?"

11-08-2018T23:54:01,unsteddyphoenix,I could just watch those cats cooking and not play the game tbh
11-08-2018T23:54:36,TorqueEmUp,"I got the weapons I wanted, and got the armor that I thought looked the coolest. I'm done, I ain't grinding to get slightly better gear."
11-08-2018T23:54:38,Dadrobit,"But yeah, the grind gets bad if you don't group up with friends to chat with while you're killing the same monster for the 87th time."
11-08-2018T23:55:21,unsteddyphoenix,I can see that
11-08-2018T23:55:59,unsteddyphoenix,Thankfully at least like half of my friends have bought or are buying it
11-08-2018T23:56:38,TorqueEmUp,"To me, I'd rather just go and play another game at that point. I feel spending hours grinding for a peice of gear is a huge waste of time, that could be spent on a game that's more deserving that doesn't involve spending hours collecting so many orbs."
11-08-2018T23:56:40,unsteddyphoenix,So i should be good for late game
11-08-2018T23:57:19,TorqueEmUp,Why would I want to keep killing the same monster over and over?
11-08-2018T23:57:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Games like that are only annoying if what you get doesn’t match the effort you put in
11-08-2018T23:58:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"Jack’s video gave me some insight to it, but I don’t see myself staying on it for hours"
11-08-2018T23:59:14,unsteddyphoenix,I think most of the fun that comes with those types of games are having friends to play it with
11-08-2018T23:59:32,TorqueEmUp,"Of course, I would only play it if I have friends to play with it."
11-08-2018T23:59:35,unsteddyphoenix,If I didnt have lads I probably wouldnt play any multiplayer games at this point
11-08-2018T23:59:39,TorqueEmUp,It's friggin' boring solo.
