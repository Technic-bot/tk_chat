11-02-2018T00:00:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Who do you watch?
11-02-2018T00:05:53,unsteddyphoenix,Hmm...I watch roosterteeth a decent amount. Mostly a bunch of smaller ones though.
11-02-2018T00:08:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I came across a few of their podcasts once. Wheezed with laughter
11-02-2018T00:09:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Favorite story is the Joker role playing date
11-02-2018T00:10:01,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh yeah, I think that one got animated lol."
11-02-2018T00:10:12,unsteddyphoenix,The podcasts are prolly what I listen to most
11-02-2018T00:10:17,unsteddyphoenix,Easy to put on in the background~
11-02-2018T00:11:04,Bgrmystr2,dat why you still like me phoenix? :v
11-02-2018T00:11:06,Bgrmystr2,cuz I talk at you
11-02-2018T00:11:08,Bgrmystr2,?
11-02-2018T00:11:23,Bgrmystr2,or did you stop liking me long ago and I just never noticed?
11-02-2018T00:11:33,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering:
11-02-2018T00:11:59,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah!
11-02-2018T00:12:01,unsteddyphoenix,I mean
11-02-2018T00:12:05,unsteddyphoenix,To the first one
11-02-2018T00:12:20,Bgrmystr2,haha
11-02-2018T00:12:29,Bgrmystr2,mhm :ptv-snicker:
11-02-2018T00:13:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Doesn’t background noise and venting to others make you so much more productive though?
11-02-2018T00:13:28,unsteddyphoenix,Mmm...music does.
11-02-2018T00:13:42,unsteddyphoenix,But if im trying to do work and listen to something i'll just stop doing one or the other
11-02-2018T00:13:58,Bgrmystr2,":thinking:I don't know, kiwi. Venting gets stuff off your chest and makes you feel better. It relieves stress"
11-02-2018T00:14:21,Bgrmystr2,background noise is more dependant on the person I feel
11-02-2018T00:14:36,Bgrmystr2,"I don't really care either way, so"
11-02-2018T00:14:38,Bgrmystr2,:)
11-02-2018T00:14:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"After a good conversation, I know I can get a lot done"
11-02-2018T00:14:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Sometimes ya gotta scream to the void
11-02-2018T00:15:15,SpazztasticKiwi,And that void is your friend
11-02-2018T00:15:17,Bgrmystr2,"I do like background music, but I do just fine without it as well."
11-02-2018T00:16:18,unsteddyphoenix,feels void man
11-02-2018T00:17:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"I do too, it just really depends. I find it hard to concentrate when there’s another conversation in the room. Makes me feel like I’m eavesdropping"
11-02-2018T00:17:27,SpazztasticKiwi,So I’ll turn on some music
11-02-2018T00:20:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"I can turn on a YouTube video and clean my entire room, too"
11-02-2018T00:21:01,unsteddyphoenix,It's good for stuff like that
11-02-2018T00:21:39,unsteddyphoenix,"Just hard for like, things that require thinkin"
11-02-2018T00:21:55,unsteddyphoenix,My friend can play games while listening to audio books
11-02-2018T00:21:58,unsteddyphoenix,Cant emulate that :/
11-02-2018T00:22:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"There’s times I turn it off, too, but I’ve fallen asleep during a Jacksepticeye and Crankgameplays video"
11-02-2018T00:23:12,unsteddyphoenix,Lol I do that on purpose
11-02-2018T00:23:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"Multiple times for jack, actually"
11-02-2018T00:23:26,unsteddyphoenix,Going to sleep listening to youtube is easier than tossing and turning for ages
11-02-2018T00:23:59,SpazztasticKiwi,What I find weird is that Mark doesn’t make me sleepy at all
11-02-2018T00:24:21,unsteddyphoenix,"I dont really watch much of his vids, but doesnt he yell a lot?"
11-02-2018T00:25:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"Yeah, but Jack (real name Seán) and Ethan (Crankgameplays) do too"
11-02-2018T00:25:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Jack is credited as the “loudest YouTuber ever”
11-02-2018T00:25:52,Bgrmystr2,"Jack's awesome, honestly"
11-02-2018T00:26:06,Bgrmystr2,"Most energetic youtuber, hands down"
11-02-2018T00:26:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m so happy I’m going to PAX East to meet them
11-02-2018T00:28:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I’m worried about the flying and traveling
11-02-2018T00:28:30,unsteddyphoenix,Oooh thats cool. Im jealous.
11-02-2018T00:28:38,unsteddyphoenix,Heard about PAX east
11-02-2018T00:29:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I wish Tom would be there. I’ve grown fond of him lately too
11-02-2018T00:31:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Kind of feel bad talking about Mark and the others on his chat
11-02-2018T00:32:19,unsteddyphoenix,It's the people's chat~
11-02-2018T00:33:27,unsteddyphoenix,"But shrug, Tom knows that inside is the place to be~"
11-02-2018T00:34:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"Still. I know he gets referred to as “Mark’s/Markiplier’s brother”, and asked to get things to Mark."
11-02-2018T00:35:00,unsteddyphoenix,"Ah yeah, that's probably annoyin'"
11-02-2018T00:35:21,unsteddyphoenix,People do come in during streams and ask about mark
11-02-2018T00:36:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"I know I don’t like being referred to as my sisters sister instead of my freaking name. I like to extend that same courtesy and not only call Tom by his name, but avoid mentioning Mark too much"
11-02-2018T00:37:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"I know they’re close, but Toms just as valid as a person and creator"
11-02-2018T00:37:49,unsteddyphoenix,Fair. Also not that many of Toms fans actually watch mark so.
11-02-2018T00:39:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"Some may not even know. I didn’t know Tom had a comic till Mark mentioned it. I tried it out because I have a thing for art, and I fell in love"
11-02-2018T00:40:21,unsteddyphoenix,"I remember when Mark was just starting out, he advertised on Toms forums."
11-02-2018T00:40:34,unsteddyphoenix,I was one of his first subs lol.
11-02-2018T00:40:39,unsteddyphoenix,Never expected him to blow up so much
11-02-2018T00:40:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Others aren’t interested because the two are different subjects - comics and lets plays
11-02-2018T00:41:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Marks game is a lot like some one dropped the bass and forgot to pick it back up
11-02-2018T00:41:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"fame, not game"
11-02-2018T00:45:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I popped into TK just a little before the 13 year anniversary
11-02-2018T00:47:48,unsteddyphoenix,Ive been reading for a while~
11-02-2018T00:48:02,unsteddyphoenix,I tend to get really into a select few things
11-02-2018T00:48:06,Unenlagia,I can tell you which page I started with
11-02-2018T00:48:35,unsteddyphoenix,"Hah, youve got me beat."
11-02-2018T00:48:58,unsteddyphoenix,I know I started reading in like...late 2010 I think.
11-02-2018T00:49:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I started reading form the beginning. Still not done
11-02-2018T00:50:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Flora was my favorite until Kat. Now it’s a tie
11-02-2018T00:50:21,unsteddyphoenix,"Ah, a man of culture"
11-02-2018T00:50:25,unsteddyphoenix,*woman

11-02-2018T00:51:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’d say I wish I was as blessed as her, but I also know the pains of having her size"
11-02-2018T00:52:42,Unenlagia,"450, btw"
11-02-2018T00:53:08,unsteddyphoenix,nice~
11-02-2018T00:53:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’m currently on 702, but I’m also on mobile"
11-02-2018T00:56:05,unsteddyphoenix,"Oooh keep on going, Kat gets some nice character development soon~"
11-02-2018T00:56:41,Bgrmystr2,First time reading?
11-02-2018T00:56:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Yep
11-02-2018T00:57:03,Bgrmystr2,"You won't regret taking the dive, promise."
11-02-2018T00:57:10,Bgrmystr2,Keep going.
11-02-2018T00:57:21,Bgrmystr2,:thumbsup:
11-02-2018T00:57:43,TheBeckoner,I guess Im back or whatever
11-02-2018T00:57:45,TheBeckoner,^O^
11-02-2018T00:58:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"I plan to. These streams have given me insight to who Tom is, and let me say"
11-02-2018T00:58:16,TheBeckoner,And yup TKs is super
11-02-2018T00:58:19,TheBeckoner,best/10
11-02-2018T00:58:36,SpazztasticKiwi,The sass is equal to the talent
11-02-2018T00:58:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"10/10, want to meet"
11-02-2018T00:58:54,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
11-02-2018T00:59:14,Bgrmystr2,haha
11-02-2018T00:59:19,Bgrmystr2,good mindset to have
11-02-2018T00:59:19,SpazztasticKiwi,AND he’s a cat person
11-02-2018T00:59:29,TheBeckoner,Sass? From Tom? Never heard of any...
11-02-2018T00:59:33,Unenlagia,How long have I been reading now?
11-02-2018T00:59:43,Unenlagia,Ten years in July
11-02-2018T00:59:47,Unenlagia,Wow
11-02-2018T01:01:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I think it’s only been a year for me
11-02-2018T01:01:55,TheBeckoner,Lemme see...I'm having a hard time remembering but I think I've been following for 6 years?
11-02-2018T01:02:17,unsteddyphoenix,It's nice that there are people whove been following for ages as well~
11-02-2018T01:02:34,TheBeckoner,Only found the streams recently
11-02-2018T01:03:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Same here
11-02-2018T01:04:25,TheBeckoner,I think Tom has been following for like 15 years? Not real sure though.
11-02-2018T01:04:40,TheBeckoner,That couldve been someone else
11-02-2018T01:04:49,unsteddyphoenix,Tom is the truest fan
11-02-2018T01:05:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"With the work he puts into it, he has to love it"
11-02-2018T01:07:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don’t have work tomorrow, but they might also call me in, so I need to go to bed"
11-02-2018T01:07:44,SpazztasticKiwi,But I don’t wanna
11-02-2018T01:08:10,unsteddyphoenix,Sleeping is a big waste of time I feel you
11-02-2018T01:08:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Sleep is for the weak
11-02-2018T01:16:03,SpazztasticKiwi,But I’m gonna go. Nite guys.
11-02-2018T01:16:25,BadFoMo,Good night.
11-02-2018T01:18:02,unsteddyphoenix,seya
11-02-2018T01:20:12,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, if we could figure out a way for our brains to process the information we took in during the day that was faster than sleeping.. we'd just do that instead."
11-02-2018T01:20:19,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
11-02-2018T01:20:36,Bgrmystr2,"till then, sleep is unfortunately a necessity"
11-02-2018T01:21:19,wolfspartan1,ello
11-02-2018T01:21:23,Bgrmystr2,hey wolf
11-02-2018T01:21:52,wolfspartan1,how are you?
11-02-2018T01:22:22,Bgrmystr2,doin ok
11-02-2018T01:23:04,TheBeckoner,"Sleep is the biggest waste of time imo. Not that I would do anything with it, I just dont wanna sleep."
11-02-2018T01:23:05,wolfspartan1,thats good i can't wait to see the rest of toms art tomorrow
11-02-2018T01:25:31,Bgrmystr2,"if you didn't ever sleep, eventually you would cease to mentally function, Beck. You gotta recharge batteries, don't you? Gotta sleep your hoomans too."
11-02-2018T01:27:09,wolfspartan1,on the internet no one knows your not hooman
11-02-2018T01:27:47,Bgrmystr2,:robot: *[beep boop]
11-02-2018T01:28:12,wolfspartan1,robot life for the win
11-02-2018T01:28:19,Bgrmystr2,Speaking of Robots
11-02-2018T01:28:29,Bgrmystr2,watching this new anime airing atm called Beatless
11-02-2018T01:28:52,Bgrmystr2,"looks like a mix of Chobits, DearS and Sora no Otoshimono"
11-02-2018T01:29:17,Bgrmystr2,just started the 2nd ep but it already seems really good
11-02-2018T01:29:35,wolfspartan1,i never saw any of those lol
11-02-2018T01:29:52,Bgrmystr2,my condolences. :ptv-sad:
11-02-2018T01:30:59,Bgrmystr2,The first two are absolute classics in boy meets robotic girl type show
11-02-2018T01:31:28,Bgrmystr2,"Mahoromatic was like that too, that and Chobits were two extremely well-recieved stories"
11-02-2018T01:31:33,wolfspartan1,"i watched spice and wolf, attack on titan, soul eater, high school of the dead [for the plot] and a few more"
11-02-2018T01:31:45,Bgrmystr2,"yes, large soft bouncy plot :P"
11-02-2018T01:32:21,Bgrmystr2,The ones I mentioned are older series. There's a lot of really good titles.
11-02-2018T01:32:41,Bgrmystr2,most of what's been released in the past decade is prettymuch rehash of what's already been done before
11-02-2018T01:32:44,wolfspartan1,sad part is A it was the first anime i saw and B at the time we had only one desktop in the living room...
11-02-2018T01:37:10,Bgrmystr2,I can't get over the company in this anime is called memeframe
11-02-2018T01:37:15,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
11-02-2018T01:37:29,wolfspartan1,lol really?
11-02-2018T01:37:45,Bgrmystr2,yeh
11-02-2018T01:40:17,wolfspartan1,funny name for a company but anyways i'm going to bed good night
11-02-2018T01:40:25,Bgrmystr2,gnight
11-02-2018T01:41:10,wolfspartan1,night :ctwokinds-RainezZz:
11-02-2018T01:51:50,TheBeckoner,Dang Maybe thats why all the hoomans I've had have died...eh they live long enough
11-02-2018T01:52:18,TheBeckoner,But seriously my short term memory is goin to shit plez halp
11-02-2018T01:53:30,TheBeckoner,I suppose I need more than 4 hours of sleep every day...
11-02-2018T01:54:13,Bgrmystr2,that'll do it
11-02-2018T01:54:21,Bgrmystr2,though there's prolly more reasons why
11-02-2018T01:54:36,Bgrmystr2,but lack of sleep will definitely be a problem
11-02-2018T01:58:58,TheBeckoner,Well I was a premature baby so that's also a big reason why. Lack of oxygen at birth = shit memory for life as I understand it.
11-02-2018T01:59:22,TheBeckoner,And uhhh insomnia.
11-02-2018T01:59:33,TheBeckoner,Other than that Im normal.
11-02-2018T02:00:09,TheBeckoner,I can always download new characteristics anyway so its not even a big deal.
11-02-2018T02:01:56,unsteddyphoenix,Download ram and a personality
11-02-2018T02:01:58,unsteddyphoenix,It's so easy
11-02-2018T02:08:36,TheBeckoner,Exactly.
11-02-2018T02:09:20,TheBeckoner,Alright If I ever want a hope of a semi working short term memory I gotta sleep. Goodnight everyone.
11-02-2018T02:09:31,unsteddyphoenix,goodluck~
11-02-2018T02:12:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"I was gonna go to bed, but I checked my everything first. Mark tweeted an hour ago. He’s in the ER. He was hit in the eye with a pickle"
11-02-2018T02:12:52,unsteddyphoenix,That...huh?
11-02-2018T02:14:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"Hit in the eye with a pickle. Pictures show his eye is greenish, but I’m not convinced that’s not just the lighting"
11-02-2018T02:14:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m concerned on a number of levels
11-02-2018T02:15:12,unsteddyphoenix,How...does that happen
11-02-2018T02:16:24,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: That.. is not good
11-02-2018T02:17:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"There was a mention that Egoraptor threw a pickle - to paraphrase, “very hard” -and they don’t know where it went"
11-02-2018T02:18:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"My guess is that they were recording something together involving pickles, either as a snack or prop, and this occurred"
11-02-2018T02:19:25,Bgrmystr2,Mark's twitter says ninja brian threw pickle
11-02-2018T02:19:27,Bgrmystr2,so..
11-02-2018T02:19:34,unsteddyphoenix,I mean...
11-02-2018T02:19:35,Bgrmystr2,"basically, that's what happened."
11-02-2018T02:19:38,unsteddyphoenix,Sorry but that is hilarious
11-02-2018T02:19:41,Bgrmystr2,yeah
11-02-2018T02:19:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Ego may have thrown it as part of the video or as a joke. I don’t think we’ll know for sure until Mark tweets an update or the video comes out
11-02-2018T02:19:54,Bgrmystr2,must have hurt like a bitch though
11-02-2018T02:20:08,unsteddyphoenix,Hopefuly it wasnt an angery pickle throw
11-02-2018T02:20:57,Bgrmystr2,"also, if mark's twitter says it was ninja brian, that means it wasn't egoraptor"
11-02-2018T02:21:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw Ego mixed in my tweets. I don’t think there’s a soul not commenting on it. Everyone’s reaction seems to be torn between how and are you ok
11-02-2018T02:22:17,Bgrmystr2,You know.. I think this may be why tom had to leave. :u
11-02-2018T02:22:38,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, maybe not, but"
11-02-2018T02:22:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"Mark must not be too bad, though. He’s on Tumblr now"
11-02-2018T02:23:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"Judging by the tweets, it happened an hour ago, but I bet that’s possible. Mark doesn’t strike me as one to tweet about an ER injury moments after instead of getting treatment"
11-02-2018T02:24:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"Plus, an hour ago for Mark is 12:00 a.m. weird to be recording then"
11-02-2018T02:25:58,unsteddyphoenix,Tom and Mark dont live that close though do they?
11-02-2018T02:26:14,Bgrmystr2,I remember Mark was visiting family for a bit
11-02-2018T02:26:29,Bgrmystr2,"otherwise, Mark lives in California last I recall"
11-02-2018T02:27:15,Bgrmystr2,Los Angeles
11-02-2018T02:31:48,Twokinds,Opposite sides of the country pretty much
11-02-2018T02:32:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel like I’ve been caught with my hand in the cookie jar
11-02-2018T02:32:57,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh I see.
11-02-2018T02:33:17,SpazztasticKiwi,No idea you were still watching Tom
11-02-2018T02:33:51,unsteddyphoenix,Makes sense that he only comes down for christmas
11-02-2018T02:36:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’m hesitant to comment, but yeah- it’s pretty far, and schedules get in the way I’m sure"
11-02-2018T02:36:29,unsteddyphoenix,Still...:cucumber::eyes:
11-02-2018T02:36:57,Twokinds,https://youtu.be/RtWBlDC2-ss?t=20s
11-02-2018T02:37:24,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha
11-02-2018T02:37:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Im just gonna day I hope he’s ok and shut my mouth
11-02-2018T02:37:46,unsteddyphoenix,Nooo keep me posted
11-02-2018T02:37:59,unsteddyphoenix,This is the real youtube drama
11-02-2018T02:38:11,unsteddyphoenix,The midnight pickle is the deadliest
11-02-2018T02:38:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok that was good
11-02-2018T02:38:48,unsteddyphoenix,Im so amused how did this happen
11-02-2018T02:39:11,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s Mark.
11-02-2018T02:39:59,Bgrmystr2,Hahahahaha xD Fuckin.. tom
11-02-2018T02:40:10,Bgrmystr2,Stay classy :ok_hand:
11-02-2018T02:40:52,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s one of those people you love to death but at the same time he reminds you of a glo stick
11-02-2018T02:40:54,unsteddyphoenix,That slug lady's voice is permanently imprinted into my head
11-02-2018T02:41:11,Bgrmystr2,"Yeh best wishes to Mark btw, Tom."
11-02-2018T02:41:16,SpazztasticKiwi,You wanna shake him until the light comes on
11-02-2018T02:41:30,unsteddyphoenix,So a younger sibling then
11-02-2018T02:41:32,unsteddyphoenix,Checks out
11-02-2018T02:41:44,Bgrmystr2,haha
11-02-2018T02:41:59,Bgrmystr2,I guess I feel like that with a lot of people..
11-02-2018T02:42:05,Bgrmystr2,That's something I know all too well
11-02-2018T02:42:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I have just an older sister
11-02-2018T02:43:25,Bgrmystr2,what's it like? Having a sister
11-02-2018T02:43:32,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
11-02-2018T02:43:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’m the firecracker, she often wishes she didn’t know me"
11-02-2018T02:44:01,unsteddyphoenix,Loud.
11-02-2018T02:44:14,Bgrmystr2,she annoying and snarky yet still somehow you wouldn't want her to disappear forever?
11-02-2018T02:44:24,Bgrmystr2,or would that be younger sister?
11-02-2018T02:44:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"She’s older than me, and she’s quiet actually."
11-02-2018T02:44:53,Bgrmystr2,oooh
11-02-2018T02:45:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"I introduced her to Jacksepticeye and Mark, and her response to what she thought of them?"
11-02-2018T02:45:48,SpazztasticKiwi,“They’re loud and like to swear”
11-02-2018T02:45:52,Bgrmystr2,Yeah they are
11-02-2018T02:46:00,Bgrmystr2,"in their case, it ends up being a good thing"
11-02-2018T02:46:01,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah shes rightr
11-02-2018T02:46:39,Bgrmystr2,Sometimes I wonder what my life would be right now if my sister were still here today. :ptv-wondering:
11-02-2018T02:46:55,SpazztasticKiwi,What
11-02-2018T02:47:00,unsteddyphoenix,"You wouldnt like sisters, for one."
11-02-2018T02:47:07,Bgrmystr2,I guess.
11-02-2018T02:47:21,Bgrmystr2,or maybe I would
11-02-2018T02:47:44,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s more chill now that we’re older
11-02-2018T02:47:54,Bgrmystr2,"¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I dunno, I never got to know her."
11-02-2018T02:48:01,Bgrmystr2,Wish I could have
11-02-2018T02:48:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Watching Jack and Mark helped get us a little closer
11-02-2018T02:48:36,SpazztasticKiwi,What happened with your sister
11-02-2018T02:48:41,Bgrmystr2,I'm a little jealous then
11-02-2018T02:48:55,Bgrmystr2,"Oh, my sister died 8 hours after she was born. When I was 2 or 3 or something."
11-02-2018T02:49:06,unsteddyphoenix,Come to think of it i do watch some lets plays with mine
11-02-2018T02:49:09,SpazztasticKiwi,So sorry
11-02-2018T02:49:17,unsteddyphoenix,Guess its good bonding
11-02-2018T02:49:29,SpazztasticKiwi,My parents were thinking of trying for another when my dad died
11-02-2018T02:49:30,Bgrmystr2,"Yeh, it really destroyed my mother at the time. I don't have any memories of it since I was young."
11-02-2018T02:50:11,Bgrmystr2,She would have been.. 26 or.. 25 or.. Fuck I don't recall
11-02-2018T02:50:30,Bgrmystr2,maybe when I was 4 then?
11-02-2018T02:50:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Shed be my sisters age and it looks like your my age
11-02-2018T02:50:46,Bgrmystr2,;&lt; I never remember
11-02-2018T02:50:51,Bgrmystr2,I'm gonna be 30 this year lol
11-02-2018T02:50:55,SpazztasticKiwi,*You’re
11-02-2018T02:51:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Nm
11-02-2018T02:51:34,Bgrmystr2,she would definitely have been in her mid-20s
11-02-2018T02:51:58,Bgrmystr2,I'm mostly just sad that I never got to experience having a sister lol
11-02-2018T02:52:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I wish I had a brother
11-02-2018T02:52:20,Bgrmystr2,"it never affected me emotionally since I was too young to even remember stuff back then, basically"
11-02-2018T02:52:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Kinda
11-02-2018T02:52:42,Bgrmystr2,boys are gross and have cooties
11-02-2018T02:52:45,Bgrmystr2,you don't want one.
11-02-2018T02:52:46,Bgrmystr2,:V
11-02-2018T02:53:07,unsteddyphoenix,Can confirm
11-02-2018T02:53:13,SpazztasticKiwi,That ship sank almost ten years ago
11-02-2018T02:53:16,Bgrmystr2,"Same, phoenix"
11-02-2018T02:53:17,Bgrmystr2,xD
11-02-2018T02:54:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"I was supposed to be a boy, actually. Born in the blue delivery room, had a blue blanket in the crib, and then I appeared"
11-02-2018T02:55:52,unsteddyphoenix,Dodged a bullet~
11-02-2018T02:56:07,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-confused: It's a B- wait what
11-02-2018T02:56:22,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s essentially what happened
11-02-2018T02:56:36,Bgrmystr2,:thumbsup:
11-02-2018T02:57:09,Bgrmystr2,"Did you ever figure out if that was you telling life that you're your own person, and fuck it's pre-choice shit, or did life fuck you off instead and make you something you weren't supposed to be?"
11-02-2018T02:57:16,Bgrmystr2,cuz it could be either one
11-02-2018T02:57:48,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, irrelevant of what happened, you're still you, so"
11-02-2018T02:57:54,Bgrmystr2,"that's what matters, yeah?"
11-02-2018T02:58:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"I think the doctors just assumed without looking to closely. I’m ok being a girl. If it wasn’t for the occasional sexual harassment on the street, it’d be perfect"
11-02-2018T02:58:33,Bgrmystr2,people are stupid
11-02-2018T02:58:34,Bgrmystr2,ignore them
11-02-2018T02:59:01,SpazztasticKiwi,And the “fellow fan” I talked about earlier
11-02-2018T03:01:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"But anyway, enough of my saltiness. What’s up with y’all"
11-02-2018T03:01:23,Bgrmystr2,still watchin Beatless
11-02-2018T03:02:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Is that a who or what
11-02-2018T03:02:11,SpazztasticKiwi,And what are they
11-02-2018T03:02:17,Bgrmystr2,it's an anime
11-02-2018T03:02:23,Bgrmystr2,and it's good xD
11-02-2018T03:03:09,SpazztasticKiwi,That makes me think. What would TK look like animated?
11-02-2018T03:04:52,unsteddyphoenix,Impossibly amazing
11-02-2018T03:05:06,Bgrmystr2,Agree ^
11-02-2018T03:05:43,SpazztasticKiwi,And very cute. I can imagine Flora’s voice. Something bubbly
11-02-2018T03:06:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I see some of myself in her. Particularly the attention span of a spoon part
11-02-2018T03:07:52,unsteddyphoenix,Chase any butterflies recently?
11-02-2018T03:08:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I once braked in the middle of the road to let one cross
11-02-2018T03:08:38,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
11-02-2018T03:08:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Does that count?
11-02-2018T03:08:49,unsteddyphoenix,Kiiinda?
11-02-2018T03:09:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Whoever marries me better be good with kids because god knows I have the mentality of one
11-02-2018T03:09:52,SpazztasticKiwi,And like cats.
11-02-2018T03:11:11,unsteddyphoenix,Hence your name i suppose
11-02-2018T03:11:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Yep. It combines Kiwi’s nickname from when she was a kitten
11-02-2018T03:13:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"Speaking of cats, Bagheera is on my bed grooming what seems to be as loudly as possible"
11-02-2018T03:14:34,unsteddyphoenix,Thats so
11-02-2018T03:14:50,unsteddyphoenix,Comfy :ctwokinds-daydreamingkat:
11-02-2018T03:15:25,SpazztasticKiwi,He sounds like an old man eating mashed potatoes with no teeth
11-02-2018T03:15:46,unsteddyphoenix,Thats adorable
11-02-2018T03:16:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"Yeah. He wasn’t supposed to be mine, but I can’t imagine life without him now"
11-02-2018T03:18:54,SpazztasticKiwi,No-kill shelter wouldn’t take a black cat. Still makes me salty
11-02-2018T03:19:18,Bgrmystr2,why not
11-02-2018T03:19:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"He’s a black cat. Evidently, they’re racist"
11-02-2018T03:19:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Black cats are “bad luck”
11-02-2018T03:19:58,unsteddyphoenix,Hard to believe
11-02-2018T03:21:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"Not the most racist thing I’ve experienced, unfortunately. The south isn’t all bad, but there’s some rotten apples"
11-02-2018T03:23:18,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s fallen asleep with his head up 😸
11-02-2018T03:25:43,unsteddyphoenix,I love this
11-02-2018T03:26:07,SpazztasticKiwi,He also snores and sleeps with his mouth open
11-02-2018T03:26:22,unsteddyphoenix,Proof?
11-02-2018T03:26:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve never been able to catch it
11-02-2018T03:27:03,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:
11-02-2018T03:27:16,SpazztasticKiwi,He woke himself up when his head started falling
11-02-2018T03:28:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"Meanwhile, Kiwi is comatose in the living room chair"
11-02-2018T03:30:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, we’ve covered that Kiwi is jealous. But did you know that while she doesn’t like Jacksepticeye videos because they’re loud and leaves the room, she tries to knock my phone away when Mark is on"
11-02-2018T03:31:24,unsteddyphoenix,Discrimination!
11-02-2018T03:34:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"She hates men, but she’s so jealous of Mark she tries to remove my attention from him onto her"
11-02-2018T03:34:43,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s the cutest thing. And one of the most entertaining
11-02-2018T03:37:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"But, this is out of left field, but what kind of animal or creature do you think would represent Tom the best?"
11-02-2018T03:38:02,Bgrmystr2,Probably that hooman pizza guy
11-02-2018T03:38:14,Bgrmystr2,from that one webcomic
11-02-2018T03:38:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"Cat, seahorse, Phoenix, dragon, alien, and bearable taken"
11-02-2018T03:38:21,Bgrmystr2,with the tiger girl..
11-02-2018T03:38:25,Bgrmystr2,I don't recall the name
11-02-2018T03:38:28,Bgrmystr2,:v
11-02-2018T03:38:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"I thought tiger too, but it also seems too obvious"
11-02-2018T03:38:45,unsteddyphoenix,That is left field
11-02-2018T03:38:57,Bgrmystr2,"I didn't say tiger, though"
11-02-2018T03:38:59,Bgrmystr2,:u
11-02-2018T03:39:11,unsteddyphoenix,"Some kind feline, i guess"
11-02-2018T03:39:18,unsteddyphoenix,Kind of*
11-02-2018T03:39:22,Bgrmystr2,"I guess he COULD be a feline, but I dunno"
11-02-2018T03:39:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m drawing rn. One of my pieces is his.
11-02-2018T03:40:28,unsteddyphoenix,Maybes hes still lurking and could answer~
11-02-2018T03:41:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’m sure. He could also just continue watching, seeing what we decide"
11-02-2018T03:42:26,Bgrmystr2,"he'll prolly do that, Kiwi"
11-02-2018T03:42:28,Bgrmystr2,he likes to do that
11-02-2018T03:42:36,Bgrmystr2,that's presuming he's paying attention at all
11-02-2018T03:42:55,Bgrmystr2,which we have no proof for nor against unless he posts something
11-02-2018T03:42:58,Bgrmystr2,:u
11-02-2018T03:43:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"As I saw earlier, and I’ll repeat: the sass is equal to the talent"
11-02-2018T03:43:07,Bgrmystr2,haha
11-02-2018T03:44:20,unsteddyphoenix,Strue.
11-02-2018T03:44:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I may very well just do his full name stylized and leave out an animal. It alone seems to be taking up the entire page
11-02-2018T03:45:18,unsteddyphoenix,For the best. He likes to distance himself fr that type ofnthing anyway
11-02-2018T03:45:41,SpazztasticKiwi,What? Fan art?
11-02-2018T03:46:34,unsteddyphoenix,"Nah like, the furries."
11-02-2018T03:47:13,unsteddyphoenix,Whatre yiu working on exactly?
11-02-2018T03:47:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I do stylized animals. There’s an example with Ethan Nestor and Seán Mcloughlin on my Twitter
11-02-2018T03:48:03,SpazztasticKiwi,And Malcolm Mcloughlin. It’s not realistic
11-02-2018T03:48:07,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
11-02-2018T03:48:27,Bgrmystr2,I think tom would still appreciate fanart regardless
11-02-2018T03:51:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I do it for practice. It’s doubtful anyone I’ve made it for so far will see it. Malcolm’s the only one who has for sure
11-02-2018T03:52:44,Bgrmystr2,sadtime now. Just finished all 5 released episodes of Beatless. :ptv-sad:
11-02-2018T03:53:20,Bgrmystr2,want more
11-02-2018T03:53:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Tried Fruits Basket? It’s a sweet/sour kind of anime
11-02-2018T03:53:41,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, loooong time ago"
11-02-2018T03:53:45,Bgrmystr2,back when I was in high school
11-02-2018T03:53:57,Bgrmystr2,"been a while, don't recall much anything of it"
11-02-2018T03:54:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Inuyasha?
11-02-2018T03:54:13,Bgrmystr2,friend of mine that led the anime club was a super big fan of Fruits Basket
11-02-2018T03:54:25,Bgrmystr2,Same thing with that :v
11-02-2018T03:54:43,Bgrmystr2,watching a different show won't make this one release faster lol
11-02-2018T03:55:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh a still in production anime. Those are fun
11-02-2018T03:55:44,Bgrmystr2,"well yeah what did you think I meant by ""released episodes"""
11-02-2018T03:55:55,Bgrmystr2,the rest aren't finished
11-02-2018T03:56:05,Bgrmystr2,"I don't know when the next one is coming out either, prolly soonish"
11-02-2018T03:57:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Tumblr is sending me occasional notifications
11-02-2018T04:00:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark has to be ok if he’s reblogging memes
11-02-2018T04:01:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"But I think the only other anime’s I can remember watching are my “dark times” animes. Ya know, that phase you get with anime you try forgetting"
11-02-2018T04:02:29,unsteddyphoenix,No more picklenews?
11-02-2018T04:05:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Idk. He’s probably still getting treated if he’s not still waiting. He’s not bleeding and there’s no bone showing so he’s low priority in the ER
11-02-2018T04:05:46,Bgrmystr2,I've never had a phase in anime I try to forget
11-02-2018T04:05:48,Bgrmystr2,o.O
11-02-2018T04:06:03,Bgrmystr2,"I like what I like, and I'm not ashamed of it."
11-02-2018T04:06:17,Bgrmystr2,Guess I just don't understand the concept :u
11-02-2018T04:06:38,Bgrmystr2,"I think he was probably already treated, Kiwi"
11-02-2018T04:06:47,Bgrmystr2,hence why he was able to have pictures taken
11-02-2018T04:06:57,Bgrmystr2,so atm he's just recovering
11-02-2018T04:07:03,Bgrmystr2,and being goofy as usual
11-02-2018T04:08:27,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s the other choice. Already at home asleep. I wasn’t worried as much as confused when I saw the tweet.
11-02-2018T04:09:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"If he was hurt enough, there wouldn’t be a tweet. We would be informed eventually, but not a high priority"
11-02-2018T04:10:57,Bgrmystr2,yeh
11-02-2018T04:11:20,Bgrmystr2,"tis why usually you see famous people, if they're hurt, it comes out after they're already treated"
11-02-2018T04:11:35,Bgrmystr2,"or during treatment, if it's dire"
11-02-2018T04:12:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Jesus the discord is back up
11-02-2018T04:15:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not looking. It’s not worth it. I think I’m gonna try to go to bed
11-02-2018T04:16:10,Dadrobit,Good night
11-02-2018T08:20:17,UnknownEnd,Hmmm

11-02-2018T19:43:24,UnknownEnd,Bye!
11-02-2018T19:43:28,wolfspartan1,cya red
11-02-2018T19:43:33,JaydenMozingo,Cya Man!
11-02-2018T19:43:59,UnknownEnd,┬─┬﻿ ┬─┬﻿
11-02-2018T19:45:01,wolfspartan1,anyone here play the first fallout
11-02-2018T19:45:24,wolfspartan1,i got it on steam when it was free but haven't played it
11-02-2018T19:46:01,UnknownEnd,ごめんなさい
11-02-2018T19:46:06,wolfspartan1,?
11-02-2018T19:48:42,UnknownEnd,Entschuldigung für die Tischspiegelung
11-02-2018T19:48:47,CrimsonHelsing,"well, it's definitely *old* to say the least, the first Fallout"
11-02-2018T19:49:06,wolfspartan1,just a little
11-02-2018T19:49:19,CrimsonHelsing,"and I think if you play Shelter, you get a slight taste of the turn-based combat it has"
11-02-2018T19:49:20,UnknownEnd,Entschuldigung für die Tischspiegelung!
11-02-2018T19:49:58,CrimsonHelsing,'cept in Shelter you have no control over how long to wait for your characters' next turn
11-02-2018T19:50:09,CrimsonHelsing,to shoot
11-02-2018T19:50:27,wolfspartan1,i've survived morrowinds combat so..lol
11-02-2018T19:50:34,CrimsonHelsing,"also no VATS, that was added in 3."
11-02-2018T19:51:04,CrimsonHelsing,and I think the dialogue system is more complicated
11-02-2018T19:51:28,UnknownEnd,Fallout 4  has a lot of glitches
11-02-2018T19:51:28,CrimsonHelsing,"with typable responses to learn more from people, if you know what to type"
11-02-2018T19:51:43,CrimsonHelsing,that carries over into Fallout 2 as well
11-02-2018T19:52:16,CrimsonHelsing,also the Pipboy your character in both games has is an older model than the 3000+'s
11-02-2018T19:52:20,wolfspartan1,it's a bethesda game it will have glitches lol
11-02-2018T19:52:45,UnknownEnd,Like  cars launching into the sky ?
11-02-2018T19:52:52,CrimsonHelsing,ikr? and at least many of those glitches are hilarious! xD
11-02-2018T19:53:18,CrimsonHelsing,I say it enhances the fun-based gameplay of a Bethesda game xD
11-02-2018T19:53:27,wolfspartan1,skyrim giant chicken glitches are funny
11-02-2018T19:53:45,CrimsonHelsing,and flying bodies xD
11-02-2018T19:53:51,UnknownEnd,Hmmm
11-02-2018T19:54:01,wolfspartan1,fighting a giant at lvl 1 rip
11-02-2018T19:54:18,CrimsonHelsing,now *that* is a challenge!
11-02-2018T19:55:18,wolfspartan1,you ever play oblivion?
11-02-2018T19:55:46,CrimsonHelsing,"no, seen gameplay tho, and some real funny dumb-ai moments that are immitated in live action footage xD"
11-02-2018T19:56:29,wolfspartan1,there is a glitch where if you put dead npc between the door way and close the door they go crazy
11-02-2018T19:56:54,CrimsonHelsing,same thing happens in Dead Space 2 XD
11-02-2018T19:57:40,wolfspartan1,also the ai is just bad... cx
11-02-2018T19:57:53,CrimsonHelsing,"Skyrim, love it to bits. New Vegas, love it despite being clunkier than Fallout 4's ui's and crafting systems, I'm still intimidated by the leveling system Oblivion had that was allegedly fixed with Skyrim"
11-02-2018T19:58:25,wolfspartan1,eh not really fixed just removed
11-02-2018T19:58:30,CrimsonHelsing,"I mean what's the point of leveling up if you don't get overpowered, with enemies leveling up right with you"
11-02-2018T19:58:51,wolfspartan1,oh that
11-02-2018T19:58:54,CrimsonHelsing,"and this thing about there being a ""correct"" way to level up your character, in a ROLEPLAYING GAME"
11-02-2018T19:59:13,CrimsonHelsing,that kinda defeats the point of the kind of game it is
11-02-2018T19:59:37,wolfspartan1,oblivion it was more forgiving if you didn't lvl up right
11-02-2018T20:00:00,CrimsonHelsing,"again, that rubs me the wrong way. a ""correct"" way"
11-02-2018T20:00:13,wolfspartan1,morrowind due to its combat you were pretty much stuck with the class you picked
11-02-2018T20:00:33,CrimsonHelsing,yikes! Morrowind sounds more brutal ono
11-02-2018T20:00:45,wolfspartan1,morrowinds combat is dice rolled
11-02-2018T20:00:58,CrimsonHelsing,... random chance? turn based?
11-02-2018T20:01:10,wolfspartan1,the higher your skill in lets say archery the more likely you are to hit
11-02-2018T20:01:26,CrimsonHelsing,"like Knights of the Old Republic, huh."
11-02-2018T20:01:33,wolfspartan1,mhm
11-02-2018T20:01:53,wolfspartan1,and you could train other combat skill but it would be very hard
11-02-2018T20:02:32,CrimsonHelsing,"I hate those kinds of combat systems. I tolerated that for a time, and don't get me wrong the KOTOR games were great, but... eh combat just didn't agree with me if my character could have high skill and still at the worst time not hit the broad side of a"
11-02-2018T20:02:34,CrimsonHelsing,battleship
11-02-2018T20:02:51,wolfspartan1,when i first played it the combat made me mad because i'd be standing an inch away from a mud crab and not hitting it
11-02-2018T20:03:43,CrimsonHelsing,exactly my point. even high skill levels there's still that random luck factor. you could still miss anyway. and again at the worst time to miss
11-02-2018T20:03:45,wolfspartan1,i think there ok in older 2d games but a 3d game nah
11-02-2018T20:05:06,CrimsonHelsing,back when rng's were more of a bitch
11-02-2018T20:05:29,wolfspartan1,chose your class wisely
11-02-2018T20:05:53,CrimsonHelsing,"and video games are not a good place for random chance. you know luck, you get the rotten kind more often than not, no matter how hard you try to improve it"
11-02-2018T20:06:09,CrimsonHelsing,"the point of a game is to be fun, not frustrating"
11-02-2018T20:06:50,wolfspartan1,also in morrowinds combat if your energy was low your less likely to hit and people don't like you as much
11-02-2018T20:07:26,CrimsonHelsing,yikes!
11-02-2018T20:07:40,wolfspartan1,i can understand that though
11-02-2018T20:07:47,CrimsonHelsing,okay Morrowind: I'm sticking to watching let's plays for that game
11-02-2018T20:08:13,Bgrmystr2,"that's why I don't like RNG for the most part, in terms of active combat and such"
11-02-2018T20:08:15,wolfspartan1,even with its combat once you master it you can make a really op character
11-02-2018T20:08:51,CrimsonHelsing,see this is why I like the modding community ;P
11-02-2018T20:09:05,wolfspartan1,i still say play it its lore world building and npc are amazing
11-02-2018T20:09:34,CrimsonHelsing,"I don't deny that, and I love to see that in games, especially in a stagnating market these days"
11-02-2018T20:10:53,wolfspartan1,i hope they remaster it and oblivion
11-02-2018T20:11:03,wolfspartan1,and not skyrim again!
11-02-2018T20:11:32,CrimsonHelsing,the modders are making total conversion mods that turn Skyrim into Morrowind and Oblivion
11-02-2018T20:11:46,CrimsonHelsing,projects I look eagerly forward to seeing completion
11-02-2018T20:11:48,wolfspartan1,i saw that
11-02-2018T20:12:01,wolfspartan1,skywind and skyblivion
11-02-2018T20:12:09,CrimsonHelsing,yep! those are the ones!
11-02-2018T20:12:36,wolfspartan1,i modded morrowind already it is beautiful
11-02-2018T20:12:54,CrimsonHelsing,^^
11-02-2018T20:13:04,wolfspartan1,i'd send pictures but i don't know how to on here
11-02-2018T20:13:29,CrimsonHelsing,"just goes to show the saying Markiplier once said stays true: ""People - not companies, people, make the coolest things"""
11-02-2018T20:14:24,wolfspartan1,greed runiens everything
11-02-2018T20:14:32,wolfspartan1,look a bungie
11-02-2018T20:14:35,CrimsonHelsing,amen to that
11-02-2018T20:14:50,CrimsonHelsing,"but let's not open *that* wound, please"
11-02-2018T20:14:59,wolfspartan1,fair enough
11-02-2018T20:17:56,CrimsonHelsing,"gonna play WoWS for a while, looking forward to the continuation stream tonight"
11-02-2018T20:18:33,wolfspartan1,have fun on wow and cya at the stream
11-02-2018T20:18:56,Bgrmystr2,you can't send pictures on here wolf
11-02-2018T20:19:01,Bgrmystr2,it's not an IM chat
11-02-2018T20:19:16,Bgrmystr2,"you're capable of linking stuff, but that's it."
11-02-2018T20:19:32,wolfspartan1,oh ok
11-02-2018T20:19:58,Bgrmystr2,"it's not intended to be an IM chat. If you wanted that, you could be using Discord or something"
11-02-2018T20:20:19,Bgrmystr2,This is just for stream chatting and stuff
11-02-2018T20:21:08,CrimsonHelsing,"not WoW, WoWS (world of warships)"
11-02-2018T20:21:11,Bgrmystr2,"Also, fairly sure WoWS is World of Warships, not World of Warcraft"
11-02-2018T20:21:12,UnknownEnd,( ^ω^ )
11-02-2018T20:21:22,Bgrmystr2,Yeah I thought so
11-02-2018T20:21:33,wolfspartan1,world of warships?
11-02-2018T20:21:37,CrimsonHelsing,yes
11-02-2018T20:21:38,Bgrmystr2,yeah
11-02-2018T20:22:11,wolfspartan1,never heard of it just thought you hit the s key by mistake lol
11-02-2018T20:22:26,Bgrmystr2,Looked intentional to me
11-02-2018T20:22:27,Bgrmystr2,xD
11-02-2018T20:23:32,wolfspartan1,my bad :p
11-02-2018T20:23:49,Bgrmystr2,should expand your horizon :V
11-02-2018T20:24:13,wolfspartan1,i really should
11-02-2018T20:24:31,wolfspartan1,i haven't played many new games
11-02-2018T20:26:30,Bgrmystr2,it's not even playing games
11-02-2018T20:26:35,Bgrmystr2,just knowing about games
11-02-2018T20:29:39,wolfspartan1,guess i'll have to look them up
11-02-2018T20:58:30,Zakuru,creeps up on the chat
11-02-2018T20:58:30,Zakuru,boo
11-02-2018T20:58:39,wolfspartan1,ello
11-02-2018T20:58:47,Zakuru,boo
11-02-2018T21:01:20,wolfspartan1,how are you?
11-02-2018T21:05:57,Zakuru,chill bro
11-02-2018T21:10:52,UnknownEnd,Well no stream
11-02-2018T21:12:56,wolfspartan1,maybe its later
11-02-2018T21:13:19,Zakuru,sometimes he starts late
11-02-2018T21:20:27,CrimsonHelsing,True. Hope that's the case today
11-02-2018T21:48:12,Terryschannel,Tom. You probably already know but you should go watch mark latest video
11-02-2018T21:48:25,Terryschannel,Marks
11-02-2018T21:50:49,CrimsonHelsing,He's not here
11-02-2018T21:51:38,Terryschannel,Ohh. Mark is partly blind because of a pickle
11-02-2018T21:52:55,UnknownEnd,LOl
11-02-2018T21:53:58,UnknownEnd,lol
11-02-2018T21:55:05,CrimsonHelsing,I think someone has been playing us for fools to expect Tom to show up today.
11-02-2018T21:55:34,UnknownEnd,It's the pickle!!
11-02-2018T21:55:49,CrimsonHelsing,"Heheh, I'll take that as small consolation"
11-02-2018T21:58:52,UnknownEnd,Evil  pickle https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=S1cHyyZSYsE
11-02-2018T21:59:12,CrimsonHelsing,"I keep saying ""don't get your hopes up"" but then someone keeps saying ""Tom said he'd stream today"" and all, and I waste time waiting anyway."
11-02-2018T21:59:56,CrimsonHelsing,"Sorry, I'm just not in a very optimistic mood right now"
11-02-2018T22:00:29,UnknownEnd,Evil pickle!!!!! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=S1cHyyZSYsE
11-02-2018T22:03:47,CrimsonHelsing,"Nope, not clicking -.-"
11-02-2018T22:17:23,Bgrmystr2,"Tom had to go somewhere yesterday and didn't finish the sunday stream, so he did say he might come back today"
11-02-2018T22:17:50,Bgrmystr2,"there's never any guarantees, of course"
11-02-2018T22:19:37,CrimsonHelsing,And yet I continually allow myself to be duped
11-02-2018T22:21:19,Bgrmystr2,there is no duped
11-02-2018T22:21:27,Bgrmystr2,"sometimes he streams, sometimes he doesn't"
11-02-2018T22:22:06,Bgrmystr2,the lack of stream on a non-guaranteed stream means there was no dupe to be had
11-02-2018T22:29:30,CrimsonHelsing,Ugh...
11-02-2018T22:32:11,Twokinds,HELLO

11-02-2018T23:22:21,Bgrmystr2,sleep is an action
11-02-2018T23:22:30,MidnightBlue78,Its a thing you set your mind to

11-02-2018T23:23:50,MidnightBlue78,But some people sleep in the day

11-02-2018T23:25:02,Bgrmystr2,sleep is when you rest. People only sleep during the night because darkness is inconvenient.
11-02-2018T23:25:05,NightMeaty22,Just light and absence of light
11-02-2018T23:25:35,Bgrmystr2,there is no other reason to sleep during the night other than it's more convenient to be awake during the day because you're able to see.
11-02-2018T23:25:46,CrimsonHelsing,yep
11-02-2018T23:26:02,Bgrmystr2,and that's what the whole world does
11-02-2018T23:26:12,Bgrmystr2,prettymuch universal truth
11-02-2018T23:26:19,MidnightBlue78,but darkness helps you sleep
