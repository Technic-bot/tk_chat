23-04-2018T10:47:30,Barabashe4ka,Hello
23-04-2018T14:40:09,Vatruvius,Hello people! :ptv-greetings:
23-04-2018T14:41:17,SilliconCarbide,hello vat!
23-04-2018T14:42:51,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-sleepy:
23-04-2018T14:42:54,SpazztasticKiwi,My phone’s back up
23-04-2018T14:55:15,Vatruvius,What happened to it?
23-04-2018T14:59:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"After losing our bill payment record (again), the company shut them off without warning"
23-04-2018T15:04:42,Vatruvius,Tge company lost the bill payment or you did?
23-04-2018T15:04:48,Vatruvius,the*
23-04-2018T15:05:54,SpazztasticKiwi,They supposedly either lost the confirmation of payment or somehow never got it
23-04-2018T15:06:01,SpazztasticKiwi,We don’t get it either
23-04-2018T15:07:52,Vatruvius,Well...welcome back!
23-04-2018T15:10:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Watched some movies since I couldn’t do much else
23-04-2018T15:11:53,SpazztasticKiwi,The Greatest Showman’s good
23-04-2018T15:18:23,Vatruvius,I wanted to see that. Maybe I will rent it on Amazon or something sometime.
23-04-2018T15:19:18,Vatruvius,Going on an ice cream run! Woo hoo!
23-04-2018T15:20:24,Vatruvius,The best kind of run.
23-04-2018T18:13:13,TomFurson,anyone here?
23-04-2018T18:16:33,Vatruvius,"Yup, it is rather lonely right now."
23-04-2018T18:19:18,TomFurson,Just made a new drawing what to check it out?
23-04-2018T18:19:47,Vatruvius,"Sure, got nothing better to do. Just watching videos."
23-04-2018T18:19:55,TomFurson,https://www.furaffinity.net/view/27125887/
23-04-2018T18:22:32,Vatruvius,"Neat, your original character?"
23-04-2018T18:22:46,TomFurson,yup
23-04-2018T18:26:10,Vatruvius,Nice.
23-04-2018T18:27:46,TomFurson,Just made that in a few hours. It use to take me 4 hour. that took me about 2
23-04-2018T18:29:45,Vatruvius,Practice makes perfect. I may get into drawing more when I need it like for my D&D stuff but tgat has been left on the back burner for tge last few years since I lost my group.
23-04-2018T18:30:07,Vatruvius,that* the*
23-04-2018T18:33:34,TomFurson,That happens
23-04-2018T19:13:09,NightMeaty22,lurks
23-04-2018T19:56:05,Vatruvius,"Looking forward to my new computer. Yet another gaming laptop however they are the most affordable for what I am looking for. Now all I need is to save up some money, time to find a part time job for the summer."
23-04-2018T21:27:00,NightMeaty22,I need a job
23-04-2018T21:27:33,NightMeaty22,But...my dad will make me work for him
23-04-2018T21:27:53,NightMeaty22,So he can under pay me
23-04-2018T21:36:39,Bgrmystr2,get a job elsewhere
23-04-2018T21:36:42,Bgrmystr2,don't work for him
23-04-2018T21:36:44,Bgrmystr2,"it's your choice, not his"
23-04-2018T21:54:38,Vatruvius,Anyone here familiar with pricy gaming headphones?
23-04-2018T21:56:02,Bgrmystr2,"I tend to avoid headphones, myself, but you can always check out Turtle Beach. They're pretty decent. Have an EarForce X1 for the xbox 360 I got wayy back like.. oh jeez.. 12 years ago? maybe 13? still works"
23-04-2018T21:56:25,Bgrmystr2,"I only use the mic, but the earphones still work, I check em every so often"
23-04-2018T21:59:04,Vatruvius,"I had Turtle Beach headphones for my xbox 360, best thing ever. I am curious about this Acer Galea 500 as I am looking at their Triton 700 laptop...I like to keep thing in brand but not if they outright rob me. Tge Galea 500 is $300 so, I have no idea if"
23-04-2018T21:59:25,Vatruvius,they are so good to warrant this cost.
23-04-2018T21:59:31,Vatruvius,The*
23-04-2018T22:00:08,Bgrmystr2,"I think most headphones are not worth the cost, but then again, I have zero reason to use headphones myself. I don't need to keep the sounds of what I'm doing all to myself."
23-04-2018T22:00:27,Bgrmystr2,so I may not be the best of persons for this
23-04-2018T22:01:01,Vatruvius,It is hard to decide as i cannot find any reliable reviews for them.
23-04-2018T22:01:11,Bgrmystr2,"it does help if you actually have a need for headphones or not. If you're in a noisy environment, or you'd be a bother to multiple other people.. then headphones may be a good idea"
23-04-2018T22:01:21,Bgrmystr2,but I dunno anything about Triton
23-04-2018T22:01:27,Bgrmystr2,I kinda avoid everything Acer
23-04-2018T22:01:31,Bgrmystr2,never had anything quality from them
23-04-2018T22:01:37,Vatruvius,This is for gaming.
23-04-2018T22:02:03,Bgrmystr2,tis what I'd be using em for too
23-04-2018T22:02:09,Bgrmystr2,"gaming, watching shows, etc"
23-04-2018T22:02:52,Vatruvius,"I have done hours of research and the Triton is the best for what I am looking for. I went to many other brands too, best one so this is a sure future puchase."
23-04-2018T22:03:59,Vatruvius,"ASUS, Razer, MSI, Gigabyte, to name some."
23-04-2018T22:04:58,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno if any of them have decent headphones, but I'd still take ASUS and MSI since they have decent hardware capability"
23-04-2018T22:05:16,Bgrmystr2,"gigabyte tends to be average, though not bad, it's not like.. high quality"
23-04-2018T22:05:30,Dadrobit,"If communication isn't a pressing issue for you, skip anything that's labled that it's  ""made for gaming"". Senheiser 200 PRO or 280 PRO are fantastic sounding headsets and are incredibly comfy to wear for long periods."
23-04-2018T22:06:09,Dadrobit,While still being very affordable
23-04-2018T22:06:15,Bgrmystr2,"yeah was gonna say, 'made for gaming' is kinda somethin I see from razer, and their prices seem kind of a lot for what they sell"
23-04-2018T22:06:46,Bgrmystr2,"btw dadro, saw that movie you were talkin about the other day last night. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"
23-04-2018T22:06:49,Bgrmystr2,was pretty good
23-04-2018T22:07:01,Bgrmystr2,figured I'd give it a go
23-04-2018T22:07:07,Dadrobit,Glad to hear you enjoyed it :)
23-04-2018T22:09:14,Vatruvius,"I don't fall gor the ""made for gaming"" tag however that is Razer's motto. The headset would be for 7.1 surround and a good mic. I have owned several Tazer products and like them. I just do not know why the Galea 500 is $300 when I own the Razer Kraken 7.1"
23-04-2018T22:09:24,Vatruvius,V2 for $120.
23-04-2018T22:09:26,Dadrobit,Classmate has a set of the 280 PRO and I'm lowkey a little jealous of how unreasonably comfortale they are.
23-04-2018T22:09:52,Vatruvius,Razer*
23-04-2018T22:10:40,Bgrmystr2,"I figure dadro would be a way better person to be talkin to about headphones than myself, being in the music industry and all"
23-04-2018T22:11:07,Bgrmystr2,"also, thanks for the movie recommendation :thumbsup:"
23-04-2018T22:11:08,Dadrobit,"The 'made for gaming' bit wasn't supposed to be super literal lol, just meant it for any gaming centric headset company."
23-04-2018T22:11:16,Dadrobit,My pleasure bgr.
23-04-2018T22:11:44,Bgrmystr2,ended up watching it after watching Edge of Tomorrow
23-04-2018T22:11:57,Bgrmystr2,was also pretty good
23-04-2018T22:13:03,Vatruvius,I just want to make sure I am not paying a $100 brand name upcharge for them. Hopefully when I get my computer back I can do some better research and find a decent review.
23-04-2018T22:29:37,Dadrobit,"Looking into them, tbh, I'm super skeptical about anything that doesn't offer true 5.1 or 7.1. All virtual 5.1 or 7.1 means is that there is post processing done to the already processed audio coming into your stereo headsets that is just essentially"
23-04-2018T22:30:35,Dadrobit,just extra reverb with certain frequency filtering applied to it to give an illusion of surround sound.
23-04-2018T22:31:17,Dadrobit,But that to me seems suer sketchy as it's done ~AFTER~ the audio has already been processed optimally for the media.
23-04-2018T22:32:32,Dadrobit,"And the .1 means that without a dedicated sub driver, it's just boosint the low frequency output of the stereo pair which is going to further induce harmonic distortion."
23-04-2018T22:32:38,Dadrobit,boosting*
23-04-2018T22:33:24,Vatruvius,"I see, so key word to look for is ""true 7.1 surround."""
23-04-2018T22:33:53,Dadrobit,That means that the speaker's ability to cleanly output mid and high range frequencies will be impaired while bass heavy stuff is going on and a loss of overall quality will happen.
23-04-2018T22:34:54,Bgrmystr2,"Unless headphones actually have that many speakers in there, I would never trust anything that says it has more than Left and Right"
23-04-2018T22:34:56,Vatruvius,"The only decent reviews I could find were on Amazon and apperentally the headphones are non-adjustable. Kinda of a break it feature for me. Like seriously, no adjustablitiy for $300?!"
23-04-2018T22:35:23,Dadrobit,"To be honest, there's barely anything out there gaming wise that's even mixed for 5.1 to my knowledge. Going beyond that, I don't trust that a manufacturer can even place that many drivers in a headset with any real QA."
23-04-2018T22:36:34,Vatruvius,"I know the Kraken 7.1s I have tought ""true 7.1"" and it certainly sounds like they do. I am curious if some of the more expensive headsets do it better though."
23-04-2018T22:37:51,Dadrobit,"Nope, Kraken 7.1 is not true 7.1."
23-04-2018T22:37:54,Dadrobit,Advanced 7.1 virtual surround sound engine  The Razer Kraken 7.1 comes equipped with an advanced 7.1 virtual surround sound engine that immerses you deeper into the game. The engine is capable of ultra-low latency audio processing and modulates the audio
23-04-2018T22:38:09,Dadrobit,source to simulate a 360⁰ surround sound experience that is usually achievable only by incorporating more than one positional driver in each ear cup.
23-04-2018T22:38:56,Vatruvius,So what is an example of a true 7.1 headset?
23-04-2018T22:39:00,Dadrobit,It's just stereo with extra processing.
23-04-2018T22:39:28,Dadrobit,"Dunno, but anything that says ""virtual surround"" is not."
23-04-2018T22:40:07,Dadrobit,It's gonna probably be expensive as shit though.
23-04-2018T22:44:52,Vatruvius,"The Razer Tiamat is more pricer and claims 7.1 as well, says it has 10 drivers, 5 in each ear."
23-04-2018T22:45:07,Dadrobit,STRIX 7.1 seems to be the real deal. $200. https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-STRIX-7-1-Gaming-Headset/dp/B00VMY069S
23-04-2018T22:45:08,Vatruvius,Is that a good example of close to true 7.1?
23-04-2018T22:46:05,Dadrobit,Though I can't vouch for actual quality.
23-04-2018T22:49:05,Dadrobit,You're also banking on the media being mixed in 7.1.  Otherwise it's just gonna get mixed down to stereo is potentially gonna get represented kind of awkwardly through 10 drivers of different sizes.
23-04-2018T22:49:19,Dadrobit,stereo and is*
23-04-2018T22:51:10,Vatruvius,"I certainly feel like games represent their audio space in true 3D, or at least the one that have tge 7.1 option in the audio settings."
23-04-2018T22:52:00,Vatruvius,"A lot of tgem have the typical settings which is stereo, tv, or headset. Not sure if headset implies 7.1 or just 3D sound."
23-04-2018T22:52:06,Vatruvius,them*
23-04-2018T22:53:32,Vatruvius,"And to be clear, if a headset has just 1 driver per ear cup is is virtual surround no matter how they advertise it?"
23-04-2018T22:53:41,Vatruvius,it*
23-04-2018T22:57:13,Bgrmystr2,"if a headset has 1 drievr per ear cup, that's straight stereo. A Left and Right. That's it. Everything that sounds like it's more is all virtual surround."
23-04-2018T22:57:23,Bgrmystr2,driver* even
23-04-2018T22:57:37,Bgrmystr2,there's plenty that stereo can do to make it sound like surround
23-04-2018T22:58:10,Bgrmystr2,"there's a lot of videos on youtube where, even with stereo, it sounds like stuff coming from behind you, or in front of you, or on the side.. and it's all stereo, not surround"
23-04-2018T22:58:20,Bgrmystr2,it's entirely based on fooling your brain
23-04-2018T22:58:26,Bgrmystr2,there's a science to it
23-04-2018T22:58:32,Bgrmystr2,but it's still stereo.
23-04-2018T23:00:27,Dadrobit,"Looking around, it's really just the two aforementioned headsets for true 7.1. A common sentiment is that if you want to get quality out of the headsets, you're also going to want to buy an dedicated sound card for your computer as the onboard processors"
23-04-2018T23:00:52,Dadrobit,generally aren't made to handle 10 channels of audio all at once.
23-04-2018T23:01:24,Dadrobit,"Also, bgr is correct. If it only has two drivers, then it is stereo. Period."
23-04-2018T23:02:46,Bgrmystr2,"I need to upgrade the center for my computer.. it's still stereo even if I have 2 tweeters, 3 woofers, and 3 subs.."
23-04-2018T23:02:52,Bgrmystr2,dunno how I'd sort it though
23-04-2018T23:03:07,Dadrobit,The way they simulate surround is by throwing a reverb on top of the regular audio. This reverb has frequencies in its reflections filtered out to simulate what a natural reflection would sound like coming through your skull.
23-04-2018T23:03:40,Vatruvius,I missed so much...one sec...gotta read.
23-04-2018T23:03:48,Dadrobit,It is then all compressed after that to make everything a bit louder so that you hear those reflections more in the mix.
23-04-2018T23:04:02,Dadrobit,It's just an illusion.
23-04-2018T23:05:09,Vatruvius,Came across a forum that really cleared it up.
23-04-2018T23:07:05,Vatruvius,"Basically, a true 7.1 headset is amazing if you get a sound card as well...no comparison. However, no soundcard is not much of an improvement to a virtual surround. Since I will not be getting a desktop/soundcard is a long time and plan to buy a laptop,"
23-04-2018T23:07:47,Vatruvius,"which to my knowledge laptops do not have amazing soundcards, I should look for a good virtual surround headset."
23-04-2018T23:08:05,Bgrmystr2,any reason why you actually need virtual surround?
23-04-2018T23:08:21,Dadrobit,It only hurts the representation.
23-04-2018T23:09:11,Dadrobit,"The virtual surround happens after the audio is already put out in stereo, it doesn't actually take what's happening in the mix into account."
23-04-2018T23:09:22,Vatruvius,"On top of that, the Galea 500 is $300 where tge two true 7.1 surround headphones are $200. That is just flat out robbing."
23-04-2018T23:10:33,Vatruvius,"I doneed virtual surround for my games, any bit of surround is important even if virtual. I do now that tge virtual surround works from flat out stereo and I cannot go back."
23-04-2018T23:11:06,Vatruvius,know* the*
23-04-2018T23:11:30,Bgrmystr2,the problem is that what you're hearing from the virtual surround is not going to actually take into account where the audio is actually happening
23-04-2018T23:11:31,Dadrobit,But it's not actually taking into account the placement of actors in the soundstage. It's just adding extra noise.
23-04-2018T23:12:29,Bgrmystr2,"if you're playing a shooter for instance, and something happens behind you, the speakers won't actually know to play it from that perspective because the game isn't doing it with the audio to begin with"
23-04-2018T23:12:41,Bgrmystr2,it has to be something planned from the beginning
23-04-2018T23:13:44,Vatruvius,Meaning the games have to have surround support for my virtual surround headset to place sounds semi-realistically?
23-04-2018T23:14:12,Dadrobit,"Nope, still won't help."
23-04-2018T23:14:29,Bgrmystr2,the game has to actually have virtual surround built into the audio itself
23-04-2018T23:14:47,Bgrmystr2,"when you see videos like this on youtube, with virtual audio https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUDTlvagjJA"
23-04-2018T23:14:57,Bgrmystr2,it's made with that surround from the beginning
23-04-2018T23:15:17,Bgrmystr2,it already had the intention of making it into the illusion of being there
23-04-2018T23:15:19,Dadrobit,"Virtual surround is literally just the same stereo audio, played again as extra reverberations."
23-04-2018T23:15:42,Dadrobit,With some frequencies taken out.
23-04-2018T23:16:13,Bgrmystr2,"yeh, and even so, you're not going to find a game with virtual audio built into a stereo mix"
23-04-2018T23:16:14,Vatruvius,This is confusing because I know my current virtual surround headset does make at least some of my games have realistic sound placement. Or is tyat tge point of the trickery? Does my brain adjusts how it listens with these headphones to what I experience
23-04-2018T23:16:21,Vatruvius,ingame?
23-04-2018T23:17:11,Bgrmystr2,"some games MIGHT do it, but there's no reason for them to do so when most people don't want that."
23-04-2018T23:17:14,Dadrobit,It's just trickery.
23-04-2018T23:17:20,Bgrmystr2,^ prettymuch
23-04-2018T23:18:26,Bgrmystr2,"if you listen to that barber shop video I linked, it'll sound pretty realistic, and that's the whole virtual surround thing happening"
23-04-2018T23:18:51,Bgrmystr2,"I listened to it with my headphones a while back, was pretty interesting what they can do"
23-04-2018T23:19:04,Vatruvius,"I csn swear Rainbow Six Seige has realistic sound placement? But maybe that is why I cannot differenciate verticallity, just left, more left, or right, and more tight."
23-04-2018T23:19:16,Dadrobit,"Yup, it's a thing called divergence."
23-04-2018T23:19:50,Vatruvius,Hmm... :thinking:
23-04-2018T23:20:30,Vatruvius,I would listen to the video but I shipped my computer yesterday for repairs.
23-04-2018T23:20:43,Vatruvius,On my phone right now.
23-04-2018T23:20:59,Bgrmystr2,do your headphones that you have not plug into your phone? :thinking:
23-04-2018T23:21:03,Dadrobit,Any headset or earbuds will work.
23-04-2018T23:21:10,Bgrmystr2,anything will work yeah
23-04-2018T23:21:26,Vatruvius,USB headset.
23-04-2018T23:21:27,Dadrobit,"Also, thank you for that video, it was fun to listen to."
23-04-2018T23:21:39,Bgrmystr2,:thumbsup: yeah those are pretty good stuff
23-04-2018T23:22:03,Vatruvius,My 3.5mm earbuds are broke too. Just ordered a replacement.
23-04-2018T23:22:32,Vatruvius,Wait...USB headphones are good?
23-04-2018T23:22:54,Vatruvius,That is the only type of headphones I have talking about.
23-04-2018T23:23:44,Bgrmystr2,"I guess it depends on how they work. Digital audio can be better than using jacks, but jacks go all the way to professional grade, and I don't know how high of a quality a usb connection goes"
23-04-2018T23:24:16,Bgrmystr2,"I do know that jacks do have electric interference sometimes, and that kinda stuff"
23-04-2018T23:24:21,Vatruvius,Literally everything I have beenbtalking about had USB connection in mind.
23-04-2018T23:24:36,Bgrmystr2,while USB connections like my computer's audio output is all 100% digital
23-04-2018T23:26:00,Vatruvius,"So, though my headset has 2 drivers, the USB connection means it has digital surround? Is tgat better tyan virtual surround, same thing? :ptv-wondering:"
23-04-2018T23:26:02,Dadrobit,USB is going to demand a good external or built in DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) while any 3.5 or 1/4 inch will require that your computer do that work.
23-04-2018T23:26:33,Vatruvius,that* than*
23-04-2018T23:26:51,Bgrmystr2,"it's a different thing, vatru. Digital vs analogue is how the audio is sent from the source to the drivers"
23-04-2018T23:27:13,Vatruvius,Oh...duh. That kind of digital.
23-04-2018T23:27:48,Bgrmystr2,"it's just the difference of whether the audio is transferred from digital to analogue in your pc, or in your audio system base"
23-04-2018T23:27:58,Bgrmystr2,"mine's in my audio system, came with a USB input"
23-04-2018T23:28:43,Bgrmystr2,but it's still stereo
23-04-2018T23:29:00,Vatruvius,"I see, so these USB connection means that these headsets can have a better virtual surround depending on tge type of support that is built into it?"
23-04-2018T23:29:17,Vatruvius,the*
23-04-2018T23:29:26,Bgrmystr2,"well, it's just a different way of getting the audio from the source to the drivers you're listening to"
23-04-2018T23:29:42,Dadrobit,Virtual surround is completely independent factor.
23-04-2018T23:29:47,Vatruvius,I am so confused!
23-04-2018T23:30:10,Dadrobit,is a*
23-04-2018T23:30:10,Vatruvius,I just want real surround sound!
23-04-2018T23:30:23,Bgrmystr2,"yeh they're independent of each other. You can have digital connection and mono, stereo, or surround, or you can have analogue and have any of those as well"
23-04-2018T23:30:36,Dadrobit,Then buy a bunch of speakers and a sub and ditch the headset.
23-04-2018T23:30:44,Bgrmystr2,prettymuch ^
23-04-2018T23:31:49,Bgrmystr2,you can actually get large scale surround sub included for $100. They're not going to be super amazing best quality in the world or anything.. but it will be true surround
23-04-2018T23:31:50,Dadrobit,Only way you're getting real surround that is faithful to the media is if the media supports it AND you have a setup that is true surround.
23-04-2018T23:32:07,Vatruvius,"Not going with that method, I like headphones."
23-04-2018T23:32:18,Bgrmystr2,then it won't be true surround :/
23-04-2018T23:32:38,Dadrobit,Then spend your dosh on quality stereo.
23-04-2018T23:34:18,Vatruvius,"But all these headphones are advertising their 7.1 ""virtual"" surround. Though it is trickery, tgere has to be some sort of truth to it?"
23-04-2018T23:34:31,Vatruvius,there*
23-04-2018T23:34:58,Dadrobit,The truth is that you're literally being sold an illusion at the cost of extra money and degradation to the original audio.
23-04-2018T23:35:10,Dadrobit,But it does sound neat.
23-04-2018T23:35:19,Bgrmystr2,prettymuch xD
23-04-2018T23:37:38,Vatruvius,*sigh*
23-04-2018T23:37:52,Vatruvius,The more you know. :ptv-unimpressed:
23-04-2018T23:41:31,JDH,"yo the tk website just tried to give me a virus, fake or no, i shut that down..not the first time for me, any recomendations"
23-04-2018T23:41:58,Bgrmystr2,"sounds like you have adware already, possibly"
23-04-2018T23:42:33,Dadrobit,"What was it, JDH?"
23-04-2018T23:42:52,Vatruvius,Run a security scan?
23-04-2018T23:43:08,Bgrmystr2,"I'd recommend grabbing Malwarebytes anti-malware, and doing a scan with it, just to be on the safe side."
23-04-2018T23:43:09,JDH,"it was automated, prob just a troll or something"
23-04-2018T23:43:15,Dadrobit,I had something pop up a few weeks back and sent a notice to keenspot about it after I did a full cleanup of my system and found nothing.
23-04-2018T23:43:35,JDH,i have the full version of norton plus firefo
23-04-2018T23:43:37,Bgrmystr2,"there might actually be an ad on the website that is either giving false positives, or being a problem"
23-04-2018T23:43:39,JDH,firefox
23-04-2018T23:43:47,Bgrmystr2,norton is already a bad sign :x
23-04-2018T23:44:10,JDH,but the message sounded like i was in a spaceship about to explode
23-04-2018T23:44:31,JDH,prob just my stuff but a heads up to anyone
23-04-2018T23:45:12,Dadrobit,"Yup, same happened to me. Pop up box with a siren attached."
23-04-2018T23:45:14,Vatruvius,"I hate Norton, switched to umm...what was it called...Webroot."
23-04-2018T23:45:30,Dadrobit,Something's up with Keenspot.
23-04-2018T23:45:46,Bgrmystr2,you think it's Keenspot?
23-04-2018T23:45:54,Bgrmystr2,hmm
23-04-2018T23:46:08,Vatruvius,Never got that...but my Webroot has a integration into my Chrome browser.
23-04-2018T23:46:10,JDH,"could be, but i wouldnt hold anything past the interwebs"
23-04-2018T23:46:14,Bgrmystr2,"Well, a lot of people are reporting something from the site"
23-04-2018T23:46:20,Dadrobit,Same ad/virus happening on the same site to two different people.
23-04-2018T23:46:21,Bgrmystr2,this isn't the first time
23-04-2018T23:46:33,Bgrmystr2,I've heard at least 4 or 5 different people say something about it
23-04-2018T23:46:43,JDH,"oh snaps, guess im glad i brought up"
23-04-2018T23:47:19,JDH,"i just closed the app, and it was fine after like 3 tries (me at least)"
23-04-2018T23:47:22,Dadrobit,I wish I had the foresight to screenshot it. Couldn't give much detail in my email to keenspot about it.
23-04-2018T23:47:46,Bgrmystr2,"the popup doesn't open for me cuz I use Ublock on everything. I take zero chances. No ads, no chance for malware to pop out"
23-04-2018T23:48:02,Dadrobit,I just terminated the browser from the task manager. Didn't want to risk clicking anything hidden.
23-04-2018T23:48:17,Bgrmystr2,"and even if it does pop up, Avast has active shields to block it"
23-04-2018T23:48:45,JDH,"well, im heading to bed, just thought I would ask if anyone esle got something like, apparently so...so good to know!"
23-04-2018T23:49:05,Dadrobit,"Yeah, glad (kind of) to hear it wasn't just me."
23-04-2018T23:49:05,JDH,thought was just me lol
23-04-2018T23:49:34,Dadrobit,Everybody was hatin' on me when I brought it up in a stream lol.
23-04-2018T23:49:41,JDH,gotta love technology (spelling?)
23-04-2018T23:50:00,Dadrobit,Correct spelling
23-04-2018T23:50:02,JDH,well peace yall!
23-04-2018T23:50:04,Dadrobit,Cya
23-04-2018T23:50:26,Bgrmystr2,"generally, getting ads from a site that noone else is tends to lean towards the user being infected"
23-04-2018T23:50:31,Dadrobit,I'm gonna bounce for a bit myself and make some foods.
23-04-2018T23:50:45,Bgrmystr2,"but yeah in this case, it looks more likely to be the site"
23-04-2018T23:50:52,Bgrmystr2,have fun dadro :o
23-04-2018T23:54:45,Vatruvius,"So, one of the true 7.1 surround headsets has its own control box, is that the prod8version of a soundcard?"
23-04-2018T23:55:11,Vatruvius,products version*
23-04-2018T23:55:40,Bgrmystr2,does the control box connect via USB?
23-04-2018T23:55:48,Vatruvius,Yes.
23-04-2018T23:56:07,Bgrmystr2,"it might then, but I dunno. It's probably only for volume control reallly"
23-04-2018T23:56:47,Vatruvius,It says it allows the user to control volume and switch between surround and stero.
23-04-2018T23:57:20,Bgrmystr2,"it's likely that the controlbox is just a sound control, and is not a replacement for a legit sound car"
23-04-2018T23:57:23,Bgrmystr2,card* even
23-04-2018T23:57:40,Bgrmystr2,I've seen some sound cards go for $100 by themselves
23-04-2018T23:57:47,Bgrmystr2,that's not something you ship with a headset for free.
23-04-2018T23:58:01,Vatruvius,Says this option is there so the user can switch depending on the media they are listening to.
23-04-2018T23:58:27,Vatruvius,Like surround support mefia or not.
23-04-2018T23:58:40,Vatruvius,supported media*
23-04-2018T23:59:03,Bgrmystr2,"what's most likely happening is that even if it has multiple drivers, it still is likely going to be virtual surround."
23-04-2018T23:59:55,Bgrmystr2,"since all of the speakers in the headset are going to be directly outside of your ear. they're not actually behind your ear, behind your head, in front of your face, it's not going to be something that you can tell just from the placement and audio reverb"
