29-10-2018T19:09:11,SonOfGoku,Hi
29-10-2018T19:15:29,Dadrobit,Just got home from helping out pops with putting up his new shed.
29-10-2018T19:15:46,RimaDraws,hi dad
29-10-2018T19:16:04,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/sR9m5ud.jpg It's taking shape.
29-10-2018T19:16:10,Dadrobit,Hey Rima!
29-10-2018T19:16:30,Ordithus,"Woah, that's a shed"
29-10-2018T19:16:32,RimaDraws,o/
29-10-2018T19:17:10,Dadrobit,"As far as the state and county are concerned, it's a shed. If we called it a shop, there'd be new ordinances and hoops to jump through."
29-10-2018T19:17:38,Dadrobit,"So yes, it's a 20ft tall shed."
29-10-2018T19:17:49,Bgrmystr2,"so.. ""shed"""
29-10-2018T19:18:38,Dadrobit,It's a shed because nowhere in the blueprints that we provided is there any indication of power being routed into it.
29-10-2018T19:18:50,Dadrobit,More or less that's a defining factor.
29-10-2018T19:18:54,Twokinds,smart

29-10-2018T19:19:03,RimaDraws,mhmm
29-10-2018T19:19:21,RimaDraws,my papa calls his shop a shed
29-10-2018T19:19:28,Bgrmystr2,so.. are you routing power into it?
29-10-2018T19:19:40,Dadrobit,Though.... We might run an extension cord into the building later.... And that line might be run underground....
29-10-2018T19:19:42,Bgrmystr2,and why would it matter if you route power into a shed? Sheds have power too.
29-10-2018T19:20:45,Dadrobit,"Because the people who are in charge of ""defining"" things at the state office will always try to make things as difficult as possible."
29-10-2018T19:21:06,Dadrobit,And shops make things way more difficult than sheds.
29-10-2018T19:21:35,Bgrmystr2,hmm
29-10-2018T19:21:55,Bgrmystr2,I guess I dunno all the state laws there. I don't know anyone here in LA that has a shed but doesn't have power in it.
29-10-2018T19:22:15,Dadrobit,This thing was supposed to be done months ago and we're only now just getting it erected because of holdups at state and county offices already.
29-10-2018T19:23:03,Dadrobit,So now he's just writing off on business taxes.

29-10-2018T19:29:54,Dadrobit,He already had the state threaten to come out with a demo crew about his carport that he and I put up literally a decade ago because they ~THOUGHT~ it wasn't done to code. So this whole shitshow has been more than a little tense.
29-10-2018T19:30:37,Bgrmystr2,Sounds like the fire is definitely on fire.
29-10-2018T19:31:30,Dadrobit,"And pops is a guy who likes to fight fire with fire. Dude's got a very quick temper, so trying to play nice with these tiny brained pencil pushers has been taxing."
29-10-2018T19:32:08,Ordithus,yeesh

29-10-2018T19:36:07,Dadrobit,"Yeah, only reason they even knew the carport existed was because someone contacted the county about a derelict car in front of someone's house down the road. And while the inspector was there, he just decided to tour the neighborhood looking for infractio"

29-10-2018T23:09:34,unsteddyphoenix,The big bux
29-10-2018T23:09:48,Dadrobit,Unfortunately he stopped coming around the subreddit a few months back.

29-10-2018T23:16:57,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúHey this guy obviously has no life. He can get my illogical project done‚Äù
29-10-2018T23:17:23,RimaDraws,lol
29-10-2018T23:18:33,Dadrobit,"I mean, it's more for folks that live on other continents that need an American voice for their project. When they post their job at 1am local, I'm almost guaranteed to be in the first 10 people to apply, and most clients never make it through more than"
29-10-2018T23:18:41,Dadrobit,10 applications before choosing one.
29-10-2018T23:23:22,RimaDraws,i can probably get a lot of work done if i stayed up
29-10-2018T23:23:36,unsteddyphoenix,sounds extremely competitive
29-10-2018T23:23:46,unsteddyphoenix,Yet somehow the same voice actors seem to voice everything
29-10-2018T23:34:42,RimaDraws,mhmm
