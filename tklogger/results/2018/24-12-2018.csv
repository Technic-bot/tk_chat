24-12-2018T00:15:17,SpazztasticKiwi,party
24-12-2018T00:23:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Anyone else have an urge to try ice skating but know you‚Äôd be more likely to break your neck
24-12-2018T00:24:24,Dadrobit,Just got back home. The party went off pretty well excluding the stuffing.
24-12-2018T00:24:46,Dadrobit,"Mom tried something different, and it didn't work out. But all the other food was great."
24-12-2018T00:25:24,Dadrobit,And I got some new cookware! A pair of new pans and some baking tins! \o/
24-12-2018T00:27:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Adults. Excited about pots
24-12-2018T00:27:41,SpazztasticKiwi,üç¥ü•Ñnew silverware is the epitome of happiness
24-12-2018T00:28:17,Dadrobit,"Oh you have no idea. I love cooking, so this is hype for me."
24-12-2018T00:28:33,RimaDraws,at least i dont have to cook
24-12-2018T00:29:06,Dadrobit,"Picked up some new knife sets a few months ago at 75% off, it was actually the best thing ever."
24-12-2018T00:29:24,Dadrobit,(Store was going out of business)
24-12-2018T00:29:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Yea more sharp stuff in the kitchen
24-12-2018T00:29:59,Dadrobit,Old knives were hand-me-downs. So it was great for me.
24-12-2018T00:30:26,SpazztasticKiwi,That reminds me of this mornings live stream with Mark
24-12-2018T00:30:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Big sharp knife with mr accident prone
24-12-2018T00:31:53,Dadrobit,Mr Accident Prone was me in high school. It was a running gag that every Tuesday was another trip to the hospital.
24-12-2018T00:32:21,Dadrobit,"Lots of scars and broken bones, but I had a good time most of the time."
24-12-2018T00:32:40,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúWhat would little you say to you now?‚Äù
24-12-2018T00:32:46,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI lived?!‚Äù
24-12-2018T00:32:54,Dadrobit,"""Stay in bed on Tuesdays"""
24-12-2018T00:33:06,Dadrobit,"Oh, other way around, I see."
24-12-2018T00:33:42,Dadrobit,"""Bruh, fish stick burritos???? I get to grow up to be a genius?!?!?"""
24-12-2018T00:34:18,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúWill I ever find love?‚Äù
24-12-2018T00:34:32,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúThe important thing is you have your health‚Äù
24-12-2018T00:36:12,Dadrobit,"""You will find that making video game references mid-coitus will actually lose you love. But you will gain a great funny story out of it!"""
24-12-2018T00:36:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚ÄúMid coitus‚Äù What is this, The Big Bang Theory?"
24-12-2018T00:38:08,SpazztasticKiwi,That also reminds me is a comedians bit on fantasies
24-12-2018T00:38:30,Dadrobit,I think Big Bang Theory came after I was out of high school?
24-12-2018T00:39:07,RimaDraws,2007
24-12-2018T00:39:11,RimaDraws,after i graduated
24-12-2018T00:39:25,Dadrobit,"Ah, nope, I was there for that I suppose."
24-12-2018T00:39:41,Dadrobit,"Never watched TV though, so I missed all of that.\"
24-12-2018T00:41:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Ever heard of Russel Howard?
24-12-2018T00:42:40,Dadrobit,Nope
24-12-2018T00:46:41,SpazztasticKiwi,One of the greatest comedians I‚Äôve heard
24-12-2018T00:50:35,SpazztasticKiwi,How about Jeff Dunham?
24-12-2018T00:51:05,Dadrobit,'Course. That's the puppet guy from forever ago yeah?
24-12-2018T00:54:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Yea

24-12-2018T01:15:44,unsteddyphoenix,Oh is it alexa bed time?
24-12-2018T01:15:58,iliar,"Good night, Tom."
24-12-2018T01:17:25,Dadrobit,Mine's pretty swell. Just finished helping with the shell of the shed pop is putting up at his house.
24-12-2018T01:18:23,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/yBc8ByT.jpg
24-12-2018T01:18:31,Sifty,goodnight
24-12-2018T01:18:38,unsteddyphoenix,How festive!
24-12-2018T01:18:45,Dadrobit,So much room for activities.
24-12-2018T01:18:48,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh, looks nice. Very professional"
24-12-2018T01:19:12,Sifty,"oh wow what, that's a shed to you?"
24-12-2018T01:19:27,Dadrobit,Gonna order some insulation and help him install that next week. Then the inner wall goes up.
24-12-2018T01:19:43,Sifty,what is it for?
24-12-2018T01:19:44,Dadrobit,That's a shed so far as the city and state are concerned.
24-12-2018T01:19:55,Dadrobit,For activities.
24-12-2018T01:20:00,Sifty,"ah right, when I heard shed I was thinking this tiny wooden hut"
24-12-2018T01:20:33,unsteddyphoenix,Ohh right
24-12-2018T01:20:39,unsteddyphoenix,Some nice technicalities~
24-12-2018T01:20:58,Dadrobit,Yes. All the technicalities.
24-12-2018T01:21:16,RimaDraws,i got crimson's gift opened from him
24-12-2018T01:21:20,RimaDraws,its a foxy plush
24-12-2018T01:21:25,Dadrobit,Still needs one more inspection after the last one to verify the surrounding drainage is done properly.
24-12-2018T01:21:33,unsteddyphoenix,Niiice sounds cute~
24-12-2018T01:21:45,unsteddyphoenix,Oh theyre still gonna inspect it?
24-12-2018T01:21:56,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it's needed inspections all along the way."
24-12-2018T01:22:16,Dadrobit,Just passed the second to last one after the outer shell went up.
24-12-2018T01:22:40,unsteddyphoenix,But everything should be all good there?
24-12-2018T01:23:49,Dadrobit,The drainage? No. It needs to have the ground gradient surrounding the shed be completely even all the way around at the proper angle .
24-12-2018T01:24:35,Dadrobit,"Look at the right side, you can see where we had to dig out some of the gradient to create an even level to have the lift be safe and secure."
24-12-2018T01:25:30,Dadrobit,So that needs a tractor to go back over and fix everything. Shouldn't take more than a day.
24-12-2018T01:27:42,unsteddyphoenix,Oh ok
24-12-2018T01:27:53,unsteddyphoenix,"But everything else, theres no like."
24-12-2018T01:28:09,unsteddyphoenix,"Theres no chance they'll call you on ""hey thats too good to be a shed"" or whatever"
24-12-2018T01:29:26,Dadrobit,Nah. So long as no one comes around after we probably won't route power to it.
24-12-2018T01:29:53,unsteddyphoenix,Nice! :D
24-12-2018T01:30:39,Dadrobit,"Indeed. And since pops straight up quit last week, production on the shed should move swiftly."
24-12-2018T01:31:01,Dadrobit,Then we can get to the music powered flame thrower disco balls!
24-12-2018T01:31:51,unsteddyphoenix,Im so ready
24-12-2018T01:31:59,unsteddyphoenix,For flame thrower disco ball pics

24-12-2018T01:33:53,SpazztasticKiwi,You know there‚Äôs also a collectible fnaf cup
24-12-2018T01:33:55,SpazztasticKiwi,?
24-12-2018T01:35:59,Dadrobit,"... I misunderstood cup there for a bit. Thought to myself, ""Wow, they really put out merchandise for ~everything~."""

24-12-2018T01:53:40,SpazztasticKiwi,It will go next to the Freddy one
24-12-2018T01:54:48,SpazztasticKiwi,And yea Freddy‚Äôs not as terrifying when you really break him down. Especially his weaknesses
24-12-2018T01:59:05,Dadrobit,"I mean, that's what weaknesses kind of do in general yeah?"

24-12-2018T02:21:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I like that mug but getting it would mean people actually thinking I‚Äôm gay and not that I just like the mug
24-12-2018T02:22:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Try to flirt and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúyou seem cool. You know my sisters recently single...‚Äù

24-12-2018T02:25:53,Bgrmystr2,or you could throw caution to the wind and go hug the guy when you see him :o
24-12-2018T02:26:07,Bgrmystr2,"him knowing who you are, of course"
24-12-2018T02:26:47,unsteddyphoenix,Nah hug him anyway

24-12-2018T02:30:56,unsteddyphoenix,Is that a thing women do after they hug someone?
24-12-2018T02:31:04,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe I should start having reservations...
24-12-2018T02:31:05,Sifty,"or arrested, don't forget arrested"
24-12-2018T02:31:10,unsteddyphoenix,No time like the present!

24-12-2018T02:34:02,RimaDraws,wow they never thought this through clearly
24-12-2018T02:34:04,unsteddyphoenix,"I think I just made an account for the phone app, dont really use it 'cept for uploading random stuff"
24-12-2018T02:34:23,Dadrobit,imgur is just the image hosting site for Reddit.
24-12-2018T02:34:43,RimaDraws,oh reddit is the devil
24-12-2018T02:34:49,Bgrmystr2,imgur isn't for following people though so
24-12-2018T02:34:55,Bgrmystr2,but I think they have a way to do it
24-12-2018T02:34:57,Bgrmystr2,I just don't know how
24-12-2018T02:35:03,Dadrobit,"If you want to follow someone, the best you can do is go to their account page and bookmark it. Then check up on them every other day."
24-12-2018T02:35:04,Bgrmystr2,cuz I don't really use Imgrrrr
