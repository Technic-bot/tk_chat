11-07-2018T00:17:37,TorqueEmUp,Yeah we had computers as early as 96ish in our Elementary school.
11-07-2018T00:18:10,TorqueEmUp,at home we got our first computer around that same time. a Pentium MMX 32MB of RAM Packard Bell

11-07-2018T20:07:43,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-vl685gpl:
11-07-2018T20:07:54,Dadrobit,Had my computer off for a goodly part of the last day or so from all the storming.
11-07-2018T20:08:36,Ordithus,Rain?  In the desert?  Absurd!
11-07-2018T20:09:40,Dadrobit,Flooding everywhere.
11-07-2018T20:10:17,Dadrobit,"Lots of downed power poles, but I was spared on that luckily."
11-07-2018T20:10:47,Ordithus,Stay high and dry
11-07-2018T20:14:44,Dadrobit,"Naah, I'm gonna go outside and play!"
11-07-2018T20:15:07,Dadrobit,"Also, everything is already bone dry now."
11-07-2018T20:16:59,Ordithus,"One minute you're complaining about flooding, the next it is a desert again. :ptv-unimpressed:"
11-07-2018T20:17:30,Dadrobit,Welcome to monsoon season.
11-07-2018T20:18:35,Ordithus,Is it at least cooler when it rains?
11-07-2018T20:19:16,Dadrobit,"Yeah, but then it gots super hot immediately after AND the humidity is shit."
11-07-2018T20:19:21,Dadrobit,gets*
11-07-2018T20:19:31,Dadrobit,"But otherwise, it's paradise."
11-07-2018T20:19:34,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-floAAA:
11-07-2018T20:21:15,Ordithus,So it isn't always just a dry heat :ptv-snicker:
11-07-2018T20:21:52,Dadrobit,"The next person that tells me, ""but it's a dry heat!"" it getting stabbed with their own shin bone."
11-07-2018T20:22:08,SpazztasticKiwi,The ground is thirsty
11-07-2018T20:22:32,Dadrobit,The ground votes for dakimakuras confirmed
11-07-2018T20:23:12,SpazztasticKiwi,People around here gripe that we have our Mule Day in September
11-07-2018T20:23:17,Ordithus,"I like this ""ground"" guy"
11-07-2018T20:23:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Now most often that’s a cool but not cold month so it doesn’t make much sense they complain
11-07-2018T20:24:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel they’re wanting it to be in the summer but our summers are frying hot most often. Last year we had a bit of a warm Mule Day and the horses and mules in the parade didn’t seem to be having a nice time
11-07-2018T20:25:24,Dadrobit,"Mmmm, gotta be careful with animals."
11-07-2018T20:26:05,Dadrobit,"Especially with puppers going out for walkies. You better get shoes for your dog, because people who don't are actually the spawn of satan."
11-07-2018T20:26:38,SpazztasticKiwi,We have people that bring their dogs
11-07-2018T20:27:02,SpazztasticKiwi,One year we had one that tried picking a fight with our pit bull
11-07-2018T20:27:20,SpazztasticKiwi,The owner was paying-20% attention
11-07-2018T20:28:51,SpazztasticKiwi,And one year one of the horses decided it wasn’t fond of the one marching next to it in the parade
11-07-2018T20:29:50,CrRAR,oh nooo
11-07-2018T20:30:03,Dadrobit,I'm more talking about the temperature of the concrete/sidewalk/tarmac that the dog is walking on. That shit can go upwards of 130F. Legitimately it will burn pawpads on a hurry.
11-07-2018T20:30:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I know
11-07-2018T20:30:25,Dadrobit,in*
11-07-2018T20:30:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"Like I said, it’s usually a chill month when it comes around"
11-07-2018T20:30:39,CrRAR,Horses are very easy to startle from the sides.
11-07-2018T20:30:51,SpazztasticKiwi,We didn’t take but my moms little dog the year it was warm
11-07-2018T20:30:58,CrRAR,"Oh yeah that srs, robit."
11-07-2018T20:31:43,SpazztasticKiwi,That horse evidently had a problem with the other. The other was only starting to show distress because the first was being a bit aggressive
11-07-2018T20:32:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"If I remember right, it was two stallions"
11-07-2018T20:32:55,SpazztasticKiwi,So Big Man had an issue with being around a Young Man
11-07-2018T20:34:21,SpazztasticKiwi,They moved him to a different part of the section and he stopped his tantrum
11-07-2018T20:44:54,Dadrobit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXuc7SAyk2s When the news is too acccurate
11-07-2018T21:01:09,Bgrmystr2,haha I love when the maps do this
11-07-2018T21:01:13,Bgrmystr2,that's great
11-07-2018T21:01:20,Bgrmystr2,"and the ppl roll with it so well, I give em that"
11-07-2018T21:03:35,Ordithus,I think steel boils at about this temperature :ptv-laugh:
11-07-2018T21:18:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Bad news for air conditioners then
