20-06-2018T00:18:13,Vatruvius,"Hey Tom, if you don't minf me asking how did you come up with names? Like Keidran, Basitin, and Mekkan for example."
20-06-2018T00:18:31,Vatruvius,mind*
20-06-2018T01:17:13,Twokinds,"Uh... Basitin is a play on Bastion, because they're an isolated society seperate from Keidran"
20-06-2018T01:17:58,Twokinds,Mekkan is a play on Mecca
20-06-2018T01:18:06,Twokinds,Uh... Keidran... I don't remember.
20-06-2018T01:19:34,Vatruvius,Wow...perfect timing on my check in. Thanks...I am working my comic that I mention before and I am stuck on names...I can't help but feel that doing research for this would be easier if I had my computer.
20-06-2018T01:27:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I just figured they were slightly random
20-06-2018T01:28:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Or a personal pun
20-06-2018T01:28:29,Twokinds,Trace's name comes from a road.
20-06-2018T01:29:29,Vatruvius,Trace Estate is located at 115 Trace Ct...
20-06-2018T01:30:36,Vatruvius,I have not even gotten to character names yet but I feel like that will be more fun than trying to make a specie name and planet name.
20-06-2018T01:32:43,Twokinds,Oh I hate coming up with character names
20-06-2018T01:32:54,Twokinds,I'm writing a new story and it's the worst part. I'm so indecisive.
20-06-2018T01:33:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Flip a coin
20-06-2018T01:34:28,Vatruvius,"Well, unlike Colin thing I already have the fur pattern/color of one of my characters. Still work in progress but I can see it i  my with fitting with the story."
20-06-2018T01:34:54,Vatruvius,in my head*
20-06-2018T01:36:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Used to want to be an author. Had one story that is currently developing past 50 characters
20-06-2018T01:36:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Changed the main 8 so much it’s not funny
20-06-2018T01:37:28,Vatruvius,Ouch...
20-06-2018T01:38:17,SpazztasticKiwi,My character sheet is a nightmare
20-06-2018T01:39:04,SpazztasticKiwi,And that’s just WL. “Choke” is still pending
20-06-2018T01:41:09,Vatruvius,Wow...
20-06-2018T01:41:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t work on them much anymore
20-06-2018T01:44:29,Vatruvius,"When I got my books for D&D I was so excited I set out to make an entire dynamic world to host some epic quests in...it ver quickly became abandoned, I could not decide on just what the map would look like."
20-06-2018T01:47:57,Vatruvius,"When, I have exhausted tge latin and greek roots, time to look up synonyms to words tgat would describe this species...ugh."
20-06-2018T01:48:09,Vatruvius,Well*
20-06-2018T01:49:46,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah naming characters is on of the fun parts for me
20-06-2018T01:50:07,unsteddyphoenix,While looking up name meanings and influences I normally get a ton of ideas from that
20-06-2018T01:51:07,Vatruvius,"Yeah, it is awsome once you get it. I just do not like how long it takes sometimes."
20-06-2018T01:51:20,Vatruvius,Been doing this all day today.
20-06-2018T01:51:49,unsteddyphoenix,"well, it's one of the things that you can kind of leave until the last minute"
20-06-2018T01:52:06,unsteddyphoenix,Spend your time thinking on it while worling on other htings
20-06-2018T01:52:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’ll like snake and then be like, “but i know a person with that name”"
20-06-2018T01:52:27,SpazztasticKiwi,*a name
20-06-2018T01:52:38,unsteddyphoenix,lol
20-06-2018T01:52:45,unsteddyphoenix,goota ignore those thoughts~
20-06-2018T01:52:52,unsteddyphoenix,or only pick weird names
20-06-2018T01:53:52,Vatruvius,"Yeah, I am at the point where I want to have names floating around to help build upon what I have so far."
20-06-2018T01:54:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Used to like Edward pretty well till it became untwined with Twilight
20-06-2018T01:55:01,unsteddyphoenix,Just watch full metal alchimist and re-associate it
20-06-2018T01:56:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw a Team Edward tumbler at a store once and nearly bought it for the sole purpose of putting a picture of Mark on it and seeing how many people got the joke
20-06-2018T01:56:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I like Emmett more anyway
20-06-2018T02:03:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Oddly enough this reminds me - I’ve been finding bits of red glitter and I’ve yet to find the source
20-06-2018T02:04:57,Vatruvius,"Eww...glitter. I cannot stand glitter, it gets every and foes not come out."
20-06-2018T02:05:14,Vatruvius,everywhere*
20-06-2018T02:05:26,Vatruvius,does*
20-06-2018T02:16:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"As bad a day you can have, finding glitter isn’t as bad as some"
20-06-2018T02:16:53,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s just annoying
20-06-2018T02:17:57,Vatruvius,Yeah...well I am slipping in and out in bed ehile having minidreams think of a specie name...
20-06-2018T02:18:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Your keyboard skills are evidence of that
20-06-2018T02:18:47,Vatruvius,I yhink it is best that I just hop off for now. Goodnight! :ptv-greetings:
20-06-2018T02:18:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Night
20-06-2018T02:19:12,Vatruvius,Still on my phone...no computer yet.

20-06-2018T12:23:05,Dadrobit,"Late to the conversation, but there's also a fun fact about Raine in that she originally wasn't even Tom's character."
20-06-2018T12:23:19,Dadrobit,She came from another now deceased comic called Eversummer.
20-06-2018T12:23:48,Dadrobit,I think the author's name was something like Ron?
20-06-2018T12:27:34,Vatruvius,What? Really?
20-06-2018T12:29:22,Dadrobit,Lemme go delving into the old forums and I'll come back as soon as I find some stuff.
20-06-2018T12:35:27,Dadrobit,"Post by Tom on Mar 4, 2004 at 5:22pm ""Whoa, can't believe your actually back! It's been quite a while. Thought you'd finally abandoned the comic. ;D BTW, I'm stealing your character again for Friday's comic."
20-06-2018T12:35:40,Dadrobit,"For anyone else reading this, Raine is actually Rob's character from his comic. I'm a theif. ::)"""
20-06-2018T12:37:29,Dadrobit,"Jan 2, 2004 at 7:33pm ""I suppose Trace does alot of things that I believe I would do in the same situation.  Flora is not so much inspired by real people, but by a combination of other characters from webcomics across the internet."""

20-06-2018T12:38:08,Dadrobit,"""Maran is mostly inspired by a lot of the pushy, irritating girls I know. She has a softer side, but I haven't shown that yet either."""
20-06-2018T12:38:20,Dadrobit,"""Karen was actually inspired by Su from Love Hina. She had such a lovable persona, I just had to try and emulate it. I'm still not sure yet if I successed."""

20-06-2018T12:38:53,Dadrobit,"""Sythe, well... I'm not even sure where he came from. I believe he's one of the characters that I simply invented from the top of my head. At first he wasn't even going to be a part of the comic."""
20-06-2018T12:39:11,Dadrobit,"""My original script had Flora jumping out of the trees to attack Trace, but a last minute change put Sythe in there. But it was never really thought out. So he's developing from pure imagination for now."""
20-06-2018T12:39:29,Dadrobit,"""Oh, Keith (who's last name is ""Keiser"" by the way) Was one of my very first characters, originally invented for a different story involving only that particular race of people. I made him so long ago I can't really remember what inspired me."""

20-06-2018T12:41:27,Dadrobit,Pulled from a couple different threads and posts.
20-06-2018T12:41:43,Vatruvius,Tom! You are a thief! *gasp* :ptv-hearts:
20-06-2018T12:42:25,Vatruvius,"On another note, I have managed to come up with one name form my beast species, animarian."
20-06-2018T12:42:30,Twokinds,"Ah, that's okay. Rob mysteriously disappeared and has never been heard from again."
20-06-2018T12:42:43,Vatruvius,Not quite falling over it but it is something.
20-06-2018T12:43:07,Dadrobit,oshit. Poor Rob. Press F to pay respects.
20-06-2018T12:43:54,Vatruvius,"What is with tge press F thing anyways, I see it popping up everywhere."
20-06-2018T12:45:27,Vatruvius,The hard part with trying to name my beast race is tgat tgey were created in a lab in my world...so I want the name to be kinda scientific based. For instance...the anim part of animarian is the latin root for spirit or life.
20-06-2018T12:45:29,Dadrobit,Call of Duty reference. They caught a shitload of flac for having essentially a quick time event in one of their recent games during a burial ceremony.
20-06-2018T12:45:57,Vatruvius,Huh...
20-06-2018T12:46:33,Vatruvius,That explains why I do not know it. I have not played CoD in a very long time.
20-06-2018T12:47:00,Dadrobit,"Same, not since Playstation 2. It was a pretty dank meme a few years ago though."
20-06-2018T12:50:09,Dadrobit,Be back on in a bit. Gotta go hit up the pet store. I broke my dog clicker last night &gt;.&gt;
20-06-2018T12:50:59,Vatruvius,Dog clicker?
20-06-2018T12:54:35,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I do voice work and I use a dog clicker to mark where I make mistakes in readings."
20-06-2018T12:55:36,Dadrobit,"Wehenever I screw up a line, I take a dog clicker and go *clickclick* with it in front of my mic which creates a very visible mark on the recording that I can just immediately go to during editing."
20-06-2018T12:55:38,Vatruvius,Huh...clever.
20-06-2018T12:56:27,Dadrobit,Was using a super cheap-o plastic one my brother got for free at his work.
20-06-2018T12:56:51,Dadrobit,"Lasted a good long while though, so whatever."
20-06-2018T13:05:49,Xexanoth,"i mean, even people who didnb't play the game know about the f thing"
20-06-2018T13:09:35,Vatruvius,I only heard it in a video or two on Youtube. I never knew what it really meant.
20-06-2018T13:09:53,CheeseRS,I needed some context but I got it... Hi to all of you
20-06-2018T13:10:14,Vatruvius,"Plus, I am not a social media person."
20-06-2018T13:52:11,CheeseRS,"Is Tom streaming today, or are we here just to populate the void?"
20-06-2018T14:02:51,Vatruvius,We are just talking.
20-06-2018T14:19:12,Dadrobit,Clicker acquired. Workflow re-established. \o/
20-06-2018T14:24:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve found the f for respects thing partially annoying
20-06-2018T14:24:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I knew it had to be from some kind of game
20-06-2018T14:50:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, does anyone know about anything called “hard chicken”"
20-06-2018T15:13:33,Vatruvius,What?
20-06-2018T15:13:54,Vatruvius,"What is a ""hard chicken?"""
20-06-2018T15:16:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Exactly
20-06-2018T15:16:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Lady came in yesterday wanting to know A: if we cooked our chicken like KFC
20-06-2018T15:17:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"And B: if we had hard or (maybe “and”, not “or”?) fried chicken"
20-06-2018T15:18:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"My only cues is what she was asking was “is our fried chicken hard like KFC?”, in which case, is not all fried chicken technically hard?"
20-06-2018T15:18:30,SpazztasticKiwi,*guess
20-06-2018T15:20:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"Since she said she was returning today to get what she was actually wanting, as they 8 piece fried chicken I made fresh for her wasn’t right apparently, and I want to see if someone else can help me figure out what she’s returning for"
20-06-2018T15:21:00,Vatruvius,"Umm...that is just weird. ""Hard"" is not the correct adjective to use in the case. Crunchy or moist would be better descriptors."
20-06-2018T15:22:42,Vatruvius,I only had KFC once I believe and it was very crunchy so I guess that is what she is looking for. Either KFC's batter they use is made to be extra crunchy or they fry tge chicken longer.
20-06-2018T15:23:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’m pretty sure she’s already come through, so my manager may have settled with her"
20-06-2018T15:23:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I was just very confused on what she was wanting
20-06-2018T15:24:47,Vatruvius,Hard is just not the right descriptor...that ir she doesn't even know what she wants.
20-06-2018T15:24:57,Vatruvius,or*
20-06-2018T15:25:20,Bgrmystr2,"she probably doesn't know what it is that she's describing, nor the right words to do so"
20-06-2018T15:25:36,Bgrmystr2,"there's always a method to the madness, truth behind the weird"
20-06-2018T15:26:00,Vatruvius,Yeah.
20-06-2018T15:26:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Sounds about right
20-06-2018T15:33:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"She was also talking a bit fast for me, and getting irritated that I wasn’t understanding her"
20-06-2018T15:34:15,SpazztasticKiwi,All I can say is I hope she got her stuff
20-06-2018T15:38:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh and did you guys ever hear about the kid that knocked over the expensive Aphrodite statue?
20-06-2018T15:38:58,Vatruvius,What?
20-06-2018T15:41:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Two young boys were running around in a museum and one decided to hug “The Essence (I think) of Aphrodite”
20-06-2018T15:41:35,SpazztasticKiwi,It didn’t end well for the statue
20-06-2018T15:42:27,SpazztasticKiwi,And do you want to guess the price tag on the thing?
20-06-2018T15:43:32,Dadrobit,Over 100k
20-06-2018T15:43:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"$132,000"
20-06-2018T15:44:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Close
20-06-2018T15:45:01,Dadrobit,"Just looked up a video. Yep, lady should pay every cent."
20-06-2018T15:45:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"Now, the mother claims she doesn’t have to pay for it because it was an accident. The museum disagrees because surveillance shows her not minding her children as they RUN around in a museum"
20-06-2018T15:45:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"Sorry, but that’s your bill lady"
20-06-2018T15:47:47,Bgrmystr2,accidents do not mean she doesn't have to pay for it
20-06-2018T15:48:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"When you see how the statue feel on the kid, it’s a surprise he didn’t get a concussion"
20-06-2018T15:50:49,Vatruvius,"It looks like a mesh statue, not too heavy."
20-06-2018T15:51:48,Dadrobit,"Yeah, looked like a couple aluminum strips with glitter glued to it. Kid was totally fine. When the mother eventually decided to get up and check out what happened, the kid sprinted off again."
20-06-2018T15:51:56,Vatruvius,"But yeah, the mother was totally oblivious and didn't seem to care. Why bother bringing your two 5 year old kids to a museum. That is all on her. Break it, you buy it."
20-06-2018T15:52:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh it was mesh?
20-06-2018T15:52:35,SpazztasticKiwi,It looked heavier to me
20-06-2018T15:53:14,Vatruvius,She should be put on a warning list for museums showing historic pieces...
20-06-2018T15:53:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"It looked pretty. And while her “no protective case or ‘do not touch’ signs” argument makes sense, it’s still her failing to watch the kid"
20-06-2018T15:53:55,Dadrobit,My pops actually used to work for an artist out here. He used to weld together tall boxes made of sheet metal at 1k a pop. Then the artist just head sized river rocks to it and sold them at 25k+. Art is friggin weird sometimes.
20-06-2018T15:54:00,Vatruvius,If you want to sit and talk with friends then go to a coffee shop or play ground/park.
20-06-2018T15:54:07,Dadrobit,just glued head*
20-06-2018T15:54:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I like art museums
20-06-2018T15:54:34,Dadrobit,The bust was not a historic piece. The person who made it is still very much alive.
20-06-2018T15:54:55,Vatruvius,"I know, she got lucky."
20-06-2018T15:55:03,Dadrobit,"""Aphrodite di Kansas City"""
20-06-2018T15:55:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"I know. But the work they had to have put into it, only for it to me destroyed?"
20-06-2018T15:55:12,Vatruvius,Destroying/damaging a historic peice...
20-06-2018T15:55:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I knew I was off on the name
20-06-2018T15:55:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh man
20-06-2018T15:55:54,SpazztasticKiwi,You hear about the girl that broke a historic statue by taking a selfie with it and knocking it over?
20-06-2018T15:56:14,Xexanoth,insurance company: was there any sort of security measure on the statue? no? well sry not the kids fault
20-06-2018T15:56:16,Vatruvius,At first I thought you meant some kids knocked over a marble statue of Aphrodite...like a historic statue...
20-06-2018T15:56:31,Dadrobit,"Bill Lyons ""It’s beyond my capabilities and desires to rebuild it."""
20-06-2018T15:56:53,Vatruvius,I read it took him 2 years to make it.
20-06-2018T15:57:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"Nah. “Aphrodite of Kansas City” was like, rib cage and up sculpture"
20-06-2018T15:58:04,Vatruvius,I think it goes without saying that when going to a museum if you bring your kids you have both your eyes on them every second you are there. It is the mother's fault.
20-06-2018T15:58:16,Vatruvius,Hope the selfie was worth it.
20-06-2018T15:58:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Evidently not
20-06-2018T15:59:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don’t remember how much the statue was worth, but it was a full body, from-an-ancient something or other statue"
20-06-2018T15:59:22,SpazztasticKiwi,So it was a very very pretty penny
20-06-2018T16:00:02,Vatruvius,"Museum: ""You thought your loans for college was expensive..."""
20-06-2018T16:00:17,SpazztasticKiwi,And I believe she passed a “do not cross” rope or something too
20-06-2018T16:00:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I wouldn’t be surprised if the museum pressed charges
20-06-2018T16:00:44,Dadrobit,"Ah, found a picture that shows it well. It looks like it was a 3D glass mosaic."
20-06-2018T16:01:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Oooooo
20-06-2018T16:01:19,Vatruvius,Yeah...I wouldn't want to remake that either.
20-06-2018T16:01:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I have an uncle that makes stained glass
20-06-2018T16:02:18,Vatruvius,"Basically, stupid/irresponsible people are stupid/irresponsible."
20-06-2018T16:02:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Glass working is some work to do
20-06-2018T16:02:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Stupid people make the work go round
20-06-2018T16:03:17,Dadrobit,"I don't get how someone can defend ""Oh, they didn't have a 'do-not-touch' sign on it, therefore it's the museum's fault!"""
20-06-2018T16:03:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Like that girl recently that got her head stuck in a tailpipe because “she wanted to see if it would fit”
20-06-2018T16:03:41,Dadrobit,"Like, do I need to put a sign on my car that says ""do-not-steal"" or some shit?"
20-06-2018T16:04:04,Vatruvius,Head in a tailpipe?
20-06-2018T16:04:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Yes
20-06-2018T16:04:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Head in tailpipe
20-06-2018T16:04:25,SpazztasticKiwi,They had to cut her out
20-06-2018T16:04:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"And it was not her car, nor someone who she knew"
20-06-2018T16:05:30,Vatruvius,"Ohh, in SF car thefts are high. If not to steal the car then just to get anything inside. People who put notes in their car saying tgere is nothing inside results in every window being brocken and the car totalled."
20-06-2018T16:06:46,SpazztasticKiwi,“Don’t tell me what to do”
20-06-2018T16:07:02,Bgrmystr2,"""don't do this"" makes them want to do it even more"
20-06-2018T16:07:08,Dadrobit,"Arizona's not great either, Phoenix is one of the worst in the nation, Arizona is top 10 worst overall. My family's had 3 vehicles stolen, and my radio got jacked from my own car a few years back."
20-06-2018T16:07:53,Dadrobit,"Wasn't even a special radio, it was totally stock for the Saturn..."
20-06-2018T16:08:36,Vatruvius,People are weird. What the hell are you going to do with a Ssturn car radio?
20-06-2018T16:08:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"“I don’t know what this is worth, but imma steal it”"
20-06-2018T16:09:07,Dadrobit,Fuck if I know. Was probably one of the tweakers that lived at the end of the street.
20-06-2018T16:09:23,Dadrobit,Got jacked in front of my own damned house.
20-06-2018T16:10:06,Xexanoth,sell it for 5 bucks to the next scrap trader so you can buy more drugs most likely
20-06-2018T16:10:28,Vatruvius,"I live in a wealthy community by sheer luck, so occasionally we hear of people coming in stealing stuff. Years ago someone stole the entire gate to one of our neighbor's driveways. It was not installed yet but it was an ornate gate."
20-06-2018T16:11:00,Vatruvius,The theives were caight though because they sold the gate to a metal scraping place just down the street.
20-06-2018T16:11:42,SpazztasticKiwi,“So why are you scraping this? It’s brand new!”
20-06-2018T16:11:46,SpazztasticKiwi,“Uhhhhhh”
20-06-2018T16:11:56,Vatruvius,"If criminals were smart, the world would be in trouble."
20-06-2018T16:12:30,Dadrobit,"Nah, I live(d) in a pretty ghetto area. Last house at the end of a dead end dirt road."
20-06-2018T16:13:01,Dadrobit,"Half the houses were all in various states of ""run-down"""
20-06-2018T16:13:56,Vatruvius,"Yeah, we live in a small town so there are few metal scrappung places. Our neighbors visted them and found their gate. Basically, tge metal scraping place called the theives saying tge gate is scraped and tgey have their money...the theives walked right"
20-06-2018T16:14:02,Dadrobit,The tweakers houses at the other end are all full of derelict half stripped vehicles and the windows are all boarded.
20-06-2018T16:14:07,Vatruvius,into a police ambush.
20-06-2018T16:14:22,Dadrobit,Not exactly the nicest neighborhood.
20-06-2018T16:14:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Only big theft thing I’ve heard a lot about is the girl stealing pets from cars and yards to resale as “rehomeing fees”
20-06-2018T16:14:50,Vatruvius,What?
20-06-2018T16:15:03,Vatruvius,She is a cruel person.
20-06-2018T16:15:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Bruh
20-06-2018T16:15:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Touch my cat and I’ll commit murder
20-06-2018T16:15:50,Vatruvius,"Take my dog, and will let it eat you..."
20-06-2018T16:16:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I warned my mom to make sure she was watching he little dog she carried around on trips
20-06-2018T16:16:10,SpazztasticKiwi,*her
20-06-2018T16:20:03,Xexanoth,"and on a completely unrelated note, Humble Bundle currently offers ""ShadowRun Returns"" for free incase someone wants to nab himself a nice game"
20-06-2018T16:22:55,Vatruvius,*sigh* I have to go do cloths shopping now. Ugh...
20-06-2018T16:23:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not home enough for a lot of video games
20-06-2018T16:23:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Clothes shopping is easier as a guy isn’t it?
20-06-2018T16:25:19,Vatruvius,That depends on what you are shopping for.
20-06-2018T16:25:32,Vatruvius,"In this case, formal work cloths."
20-06-2018T16:25:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh formal shopping is always fun
20-06-2018T16:26:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Especially if your one of those people who have to get tailored stuff because nothing ever fits right
20-06-2018T16:26:36,Vatruvius,"Perhaps, I hate having to try on cloths over and over to make sure I get the one that fits."
20-06-2018T16:27:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve always found the men’s department a good place to find good pants and some shirts
20-06-2018T16:27:31,Vatruvius,"Tailored, yeah...that would be awsome but no. I am jusy foing regular ""try everything until one fits"" shopping."
20-06-2018T16:27:53,Vatruvius,just doing*
20-06-2018T16:29:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Clothes shopping in a nutshell
20-06-2018T16:30:39,SpazztasticKiwi,My problems depend on what article I’m shopping for - pants vs shirts vs dress
20-06-2018T16:30:55,Vatruvius,Yeah...
20-06-2018T16:31:57,Vatruvius,"Clothes shopping in the future, step into a scanner, scans your body, then put on some glasses tgat will heighlight every peice of clothing that will fit you."
20-06-2018T16:32:21,Bgrmystr2,"I don't see why men's clothes shopping is easier. Sure we buy one less article of clothing, but that's just a time difference"
20-06-2018T16:32:37,Bgrmystr2,"beyond that, everything else should be exactly the same"
20-06-2018T16:32:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Hahahaha
20-06-2018T16:33:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Shirts are sewn different for men vs women because of the chest area
20-06-2018T16:33:48,Vatruvius,"Yeah, for the most part. Big difference though is that I am not worried if the clothes look cute. If it works, I am good."
20-06-2018T16:34:12,Bgrmystr2,"yeah but as long as you get a size that fits you, then why does it matter"
20-06-2018T16:34:20,Vatruvius,:face:ctwokinds-keifacepalm:
20-06-2018T16:34:21,Bgrmystr2,sizes should take that into account
20-06-2018T16:34:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Should
20-06-2018T16:34:33,SpazztasticKiwi,They dont
20-06-2018T16:34:38,Bgrmystr2,they fucked up then lol
20-06-2018T16:34:39,Xexanoth,Bgr....have you ever been clothes shopping with women?
20-06-2018T16:34:43,Vatruvius,Couldn't have gussed shirts were seen differently.
20-06-2018T16:34:44,Xexanoth,it's hell
20-06-2018T16:34:47,Bgrmystr2,"yes, xex"
20-06-2018T16:34:53,Bgrmystr2,"it's not hell, it's stupid"
20-06-2018T16:35:00,Bgrmystr2,"just pick something that fits, and get it"
20-06-2018T16:35:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Hence why I often see if there’s alternatives in the men’s area
20-06-2018T16:35:05,Bgrmystr2,why is it difficult
20-06-2018T16:35:12,Xexanoth,BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD
20-06-2018T16:35:20,Xexanoth,AND THE STRIPES JUST DONT FIT ME
20-06-2018T16:35:24,Vatruvius,Lol
20-06-2018T16:35:25,Bgrmystr2,LEMMY CALL A WHAAAAAMULANCE :V
20-06-2018T16:35:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don’t care about fashion. As long  as I don’t look like a toddler dressed me in the dark, I’m good"
20-06-2018T16:35:59,Bgrmystr2,that's a self-imposed problem
20-06-2018T16:36:05,Bgrmystr2,I don't have such problems
20-06-2018T16:36:05,Xexanoth,"my ideal shopping is: these pants fit, give me 3 more of the exact same"
20-06-2018T16:36:46,Bgrmystr2,:ok_hand:
20-06-2018T16:36:53,Bgrmystr2,maybe get different colors
20-06-2018T16:36:59,Bgrmystr2,"couple blacks, some blues"
20-06-2018T16:37:05,Bgrmystr2,maybe a green
20-06-2018T16:37:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve had pants that I liked really well
20-06-2018T16:37:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Lost weight and can’t fit them as good anymore
20-06-2018T16:38:05,Bgrmystr2,"I think what takes the most time is when ppl try to wear something that obviously doesn't fit them cuz it's too small, then spend an hour trying to MAKE IT FIT"
20-06-2018T16:38:15,Vatruvius,"My weight goes up and down, so I just aim for the middle."
20-06-2018T16:38:17,Bgrmystr2,and then complain about it feeling miserable for another half hour
20-06-2018T16:38:57,Bgrmystr2,"I just wear somethin that fits me. If it doesn't fit, I get somethin that does."
20-06-2018T16:39:16,Bgrmystr2,Most of my clothes are my size or slightly bigger
20-06-2018T16:39:23,Vatruvius,Eww...hot car. Very hot car...why did my dad pick a black/dark grey car!
20-06-2018T16:39:32,Bgrmystr2,xD cuz reasons
20-06-2018T16:39:56,Vatruvius,"Cuz he doesn't drive it anymore, that's why."
20-06-2018T16:40:25,Vatruvius,"Wait, that makes no sense. No matter, just hot car..."
20-06-2018T16:40:26,Bgrmystr2,"lol, not like the color is going to make a HUGE difference, the thing is metal. it's an oven. it's gonna melt you regardless of color."
20-06-2018T16:40:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Toasty car in the winter? Niiiice
20-06-2018T16:41:01,SpazztasticKiwi,In the summer? No
20-06-2018T16:41:13,Bgrmystr2,"darker color may increase a couple of degrees, but it won't be significant to the material"
20-06-2018T16:41:22,Bgrmystr2,compared to*
20-06-2018T16:41:35,Vatruvius,"True, but black retains the heat better than any other color. So when the car is 97 inside, a few degrees difference is noticeable."
20-06-2018T16:41:49,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, well I guess not down here"
20-06-2018T16:42:04,Bgrmystr2,when summers are like 90+ with nigh 100% humidity
20-06-2018T16:42:10,Bgrmystr2,sometimes 100+
20-06-2018T16:42:35,Bgrmystr2,"your car will melt you regardless of color, cuz fuck you, I'm the motherfuckin sun"
20-06-2018T16:42:38,Bgrmystr2,xD
20-06-2018T16:43:22,Bgrmystr2,it doesn't really feel any hotter in a black car vs in a white car
20-06-2018T16:43:34,SiliconCarbide,color is the only reason why the car can get hotter then the sorrounding air while standing still :P
20-06-2018T16:43:45,SiliconCarbide,*than
20-06-2018T16:43:51,Bgrmystr2,"cuz the material means nothing, right? suuure ;P"
20-06-2018T16:43:59,SiliconCarbide,"look up emissivity, im not jokin!"
20-06-2018T16:44:07,SiliconCarbide,black absorbs all sunlight
20-06-2018T16:44:10,SiliconCarbide,white absorbs none
20-06-2018T16:44:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll be back in later. You guys have fun :ptv-greetings:
20-06-2018T16:44:27,Bgrmystr2,"white cars get just as hot as black cars here on the gulf coast, silicon"
20-06-2018T16:44:37,SiliconCarbide,"thats why black cars heat up more than white cars, white cars mostly reflect and are only heated by the sourronding air"
20-06-2018T16:44:37,Bgrmystr2,when they sit in the sun all day
20-06-2018T16:44:48,SiliconCarbide,and not by the sun
20-06-2018T16:45:15,Bgrmystr2,"what you say, and what actually happens out here are two different things lol"
20-06-2018T16:45:32,Xexanoth,also apparently cars don't have windows that let in sunlight to heat up the car from the inside....
20-06-2018T16:45:44,Bgrmystr2,"apparently not, xex"
20-06-2018T16:45:57,SiliconCarbide,"looking from above, the window surface takes up minimal space compared to the rest"
20-06-2018T16:46:24,Xexanoth,unless you live on the equator sun hits at an angle
20-06-2018T16:46:48,Bgrmystr2,"yeh, not living there"
20-06-2018T16:46:55,SiliconCarbide,splitting hairs!
20-06-2018T16:47:04,Bgrmystr2,these hairs are important
20-06-2018T16:47:11,Bgrmystr2,cuz they change a lot
20-06-2018T16:47:14,Xexanoth,and the sunlight through windows is significant enough that just covering the windows from the outside makes a noticable differenc
20-06-2018T16:47:47,SiliconCarbide,"maybe, but its still true though, black color does absorb more sunlight than white"
20-06-2018T16:47:52,Bgrmystr2,"we have sun visors for our windshields, a lot of people seem to"
20-06-2018T16:49:07,Bgrmystr2,"a black car will get a few degrees hotter, yeah, but it's not going to be as much difference as you'd think, though it may be different if like.. everything is the same color"
20-06-2018T16:49:42,Bgrmystr2,they're still metal
20-06-2018T16:50:34,Xexanoth,*play hard riff*
20-06-2018T16:51:00,Xexanoth,"dam those metal cars, always rocking out and stuff"
20-06-2018T16:51:33,Bgrmystr2,xD
20-06-2018T16:58:37,SiliconCarbide,"now i WAS gonna pull up some scientific paper that studied whether black cars heat up faster than white cars, but apparently mythbusters tested it"
20-06-2018T16:58:39,SiliconCarbide,and confirmed it!
20-06-2018T16:59:32,SiliconCarbide,sorry for nerding over it :&gt;
20-06-2018T16:59:48,Bgrmystr2,well of course they do]
20-06-2018T17:00:26,Vatruvius,"I am now at the store, let's see how fast I can make this."
20-06-2018T17:00:34,SpazztasticKiwi,So I found out a friend has started watching Criminal Minds
20-06-2018T17:00:59,SpazztasticKiwi,She’s on season 5. And season 13 is currently airing
20-06-2018T17:02:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"You’re being timed, Vat. Speed run"
20-06-2018T17:02:23,Xexanoth,so according to mythbuster it was black car 135F White Car 126F....ok i don't do fahrenheit so i have no idea what to do with this result
20-06-2018T17:03:46,Bgrmystr2,"that's not too much of a diff, though it is a difference"
20-06-2018T17:03:53,Bgrmystr2,"doesn't matter what temp, you're still gonna be cooked"
20-06-2018T17:05:37,Bgrmystr2,that's 57.2 to 52.2 in Celsius
20-06-2018T17:05:52,Bgrmystr2,it's 50+ regardless lol
20-06-2018T17:07:40,Xexanoth,welp
20-06-2018T17:07:47,FuryFaZeFurry,"what did you guys say about the video, u made chat delete it."
20-06-2018T17:08:41,Vatruvius,5 degrees celcius is a big difference.
20-06-2018T17:08:49,Xexanoth,"the end result was nice, but not sure why we need a video(then again im not an artist so eh)"
20-06-2018T17:09:13,Xexanoth,depends on what the base temperature is Vat
20-06-2018T17:09:45,Bgrmystr2,"Eh, Vat, when you're 120F+, 10 degrees won't make too much of a difference seeing as it'll cook you in a very short time"
20-06-2018T17:14:50,Vatruvius,I suppose so.
20-06-2018T17:15:21,Bgrmystr2,lol watching this disaster video of Cities:Skylines.. honestly makes me think I do not have nearly enough emergency vehicles to deal with this
20-06-2018T17:15:23,Vatruvius,"Well that was not too bad, two sets of clothes tried and now I can just grab the clothes I want."
20-06-2018T17:15:38,Vatruvius,What Bgr?
20-06-2018T17:16:00,Bgrmystr2,it's a game lol
20-06-2018T17:23:44,Vatruvius,"I know it is a game, what happened with needing more emergency vehicles?"
20-06-2018T17:23:54,Bgrmystr2,"""disaster video"""
20-06-2018T17:24:01,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
20-06-2018T17:24:35,Bgrmystr2,I was thinking the city I have is not even remotely equipped to handle any kind of disaster
20-06-2018T17:25:07,SiliconCarbide,i never found disasters to be fun in city builders
20-06-2018T17:25:29,SiliconCarbide,always turned them off
20-06-2018T17:28:00,Bgrmystr2,"I don't have any disasters in the game, cuz I don't have the DLC for it, god forbid you have to pay for a DLC to have shit that should have come with the game."
20-06-2018T17:28:06,Bgrmystr2,but yknow
20-06-2018T17:28:25,Bgrmystr2,"sometimes they're fun, sometimes they're not"
20-06-2018T17:28:27,Bgrmystr2,just depends
20-06-2018T17:28:53,Vatruvius,"I like how in Simcity I can call any disaster I want in a normal game, just in case I want to make my city interesting whenever."
20-06-2018T17:29:25,Bgrmystr2,eh. give me the older series anyday
20-06-2018T17:30:29,SiliconCarbide,sim city 2k! :D
20-06-2018T17:31:05,SiliconCarbide,that game was probably have my childhood
20-06-2018T17:31:08,SiliconCarbide,*half
20-06-2018T17:31:09,Bgrmystr2,"lol, you name it, I've likely played it"
20-06-2018T17:31:23,Bgrmystr2,I own almost every game in the series
20-06-2018T17:31:30,Vatruvius,"I am aware of all tge problems it has, but it is still fun now and then."
20-06-2018T17:32:30,Bgrmystr2,honestly I'd kinda prefer the original Simcity to the new one
20-06-2018T17:32:53,Bgrmystr2,"as much as the game looks spectacular, it's just not entertaining."
20-06-2018T17:33:03,Bgrmystr2,too many negatives
20-06-2018T17:33:04,FuryFaZeFurry,thanks to whoever liked that video!
20-06-2018T17:33:21,Bgrmystr2,probably wasn't anyone here
20-06-2018T17:33:29,Bgrmystr2,was likely a random like off youtube
20-06-2018T17:34:02,FuryFaZeFurry,this is the only place ive put it and no body searches my videos.
20-06-2018T17:34:33,Bgrmystr2,"doesn't matter, youtube algorithm, bro."
20-06-2018T17:34:43,FuryFaZeFurry,ok
20-06-2018T17:34:46,Xexanoth,or someone just liked the video?
20-06-2018T17:35:02,Xexanoth,"i mean, the end result was pretty nice..."
20-06-2018T17:35:42,Bgrmystr2,"I didn't watch it cuz, yknow, this is the first I'm hearing of it"
20-06-2018T17:36:20,SiliconCarbide,what video?
20-06-2018T17:36:35,Bgrmystr2,dunno lol
20-06-2018T17:36:48,Bgrmystr2,prolly one of Fury's
20-06-2018T17:36:59,Bgrmystr2,if I had to guess

20-06-2018T17:40:35,Bgrmystr2,"oh, people fan-color stuff of tom's all the time"
20-06-2018T17:43:41,FuryFaZeFurry,but not like me
20-06-2018T17:43:57,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
20-06-2018T17:44:05,Bgrmystr2,everyone colors differently
20-06-2018T17:44:12,Bgrmystr2,and if everyone's different...
20-06-2018T17:44:15,Bgrmystr2,etc etc
20-06-2018T17:44:21,FuryFaZeFurry,no one has put it on youtube.
20-06-2018T17:44:44,FuryFaZeFurry,"infact if you search twokinds coloring sketchs, it brings up my stuff..."
20-06-2018T17:47:15,Bgrmystr2,"well yeah when you only search for what your video is called, the search algorithm is going to pull yours up"
20-06-2018T17:47:24,Bgrmystr2,I've seen videos that weren't from yuo
20-06-2018T17:47:26,Bgrmystr2,you*
20-06-2018T17:47:42,FuryFaZeFurry,its put down as sketchs...just sketchs
20-06-2018T17:49:16,Xexanoth,"i still don't see the point of coloring vids, just show me the end result as a picture :/"
20-06-2018T17:49:40,Bgrmystr2,"so we can watch it come to life, xex"
20-06-2018T17:49:46,Bgrmystr2,same reason we watch the streams
20-06-2018T17:55:55,Dadrobit,"Yeah, YouTube algorithms are killer. Only one of my sound design videos barely has more than 100 views after half a year."
20-06-2018T17:56:51,Dadrobit,"Not that I'm trying to get popular off of them, but I'm pretty darn sure that YouTube has never put it in anyone's front page recommended lol."
20-06-2018T17:57:48,Xexanoth,"meh, when it comes to the colorings streams im pretty much only here for chat @bgr"
20-06-2018T17:58:13,Xexanoth,"it's one of those things for me, just show me the finished awesome thing"
20-06-2018T17:58:25,Vatruvius,Doesn't need to get like 500+ or 1000+ views before it ever gets recommend?
20-06-2018T17:58:54,Bgrmystr2,"My question would be how does it GET that many views? If it's not recommended, noone will see it"
20-06-2018T17:59:18,Dadrobit,Gotta self promote yo.
20-06-2018T17:59:21,Xexanoth,^
20-06-2018T17:59:32,Bgrmystr2,to like 1000 views? lol k
20-06-2018T18:00:31,Dadrobit,"Friends, friends tell friends, and hope that excessive tagging fills in the rest."
20-06-2018T18:04:22,FuryFaZeFurry,4000 watch hours and over 1000 subs before review
20-06-2018T18:19:27,Dadrobit,\o/ One of my auditions from last night where I broke my dog clicker went through!
20-06-2018T18:19:38,Dadrobit,That shit usually takes at least a week.
20-06-2018T18:20:49,Dadrobit,Trying to get back into doing audiobooks. Did two before but got burned out after I marathon'd one of them a bit too hard.
20-06-2018T18:22:02,Dadrobit,Good money to be made when commercial stuff is in famine mode.

20-06-2018T20:20:04,BluePhantom90,sounds like one we have that complained about a scratch on some glass that was like smaller the a hair from a bread
20-06-2018T20:21:04,CrRAR,"ho boy, that's some high-quality OCD right there."
20-06-2018T20:22:03,CrRAR,"Also I am confused at the mental imagery of ""a hair from a bread"". &gt;:"

20-06-2018T20:30:27,BluePhantom90,well it was glass to a show case we made
20-06-2018T20:31:03,CrRAR,Wait... is this some sort of food competition?
20-06-2018T20:31:35,BluePhantom90,no I work at a company that makes Tool boxes or custom orders
20-06-2018T20:31:46,CrRAR,ohhhh
20-06-2018T20:32:28,BluePhantom90,here is the site https://www.gerstnerusa.com
20-06-2018T20:33:42,CrRAR,iiiinteresting
20-06-2018T20:34:03,BluePhantom90,yeah we make some boxes that are worth 4k
20-06-2018T20:34:53,CrRAR,wow
20-06-2018T20:35:06,CrRAR,I could see someone being very passionate about their hobby... and the thing they house said hobby wares in.
20-06-2018T20:35:22,BluePhantom90,yep
20-06-2018T20:35:23,CrRAR,Gotta be the FLASHIEST nerd.
20-06-2018T20:35:27,CrRAR,blingbling
20-06-2018T20:37:15,BluePhantom90,and we make this. Which is like a Bitch and a half to make https://www.bestmadeco.com/products/gerstner-field-chest?taxon_id=1171
20-06-2018T20:38:12,CrRAR,ooo what type of wood?
20-06-2018T20:38:18,CrRAR,Is that cedar...
20-06-2018T20:38:22,CrRAR,or walnut?
20-06-2018T20:38:26,BluePhantom90,Cherry
20-06-2018T20:38:39,Vatruvius,Wow...that foes look like a pain to make.
20-06-2018T20:38:41,CrRAR,"oooo, fancy"
20-06-2018T20:38:46,Vatruvius,does*
20-06-2018T20:39:11,CrRAR,Yeah lol it's like a case-in-a-case
20-06-2018T20:39:19,CrRAR,C A S E C E P T I O N
20-06-2018T20:39:31,Vatruvius,But it does sell for 5k+ so...
20-06-2018T20:40:14,BluePhantom90,yeah it would have sold for 7k if we used different wood.
20-06-2018T20:40:50,CrRAR,Cherry's a pretty dense wood already right?
20-06-2018T20:41:20,BluePhantom90,No Cherry is vary soft. You can dent it easy thats why its a bitch and a half to make
20-06-2018T20:41:22,Vatruvius,I can see that...I am not aware of types of wood and their relative cost but wouldn't walnut be more expensive?
20-06-2018T20:41:57,BluePhantom90,not really Walnut is fairly common in the U.S.
20-06-2018T20:42:33,Vatruvius,Hmm...what would be a very expensive wood?
20-06-2018T20:42:54,Vatruvius,Other than custom layered stuff.
20-06-2018T20:42:56,BluePhantom90,Hickory is another wood that is a pain. but the most beautiful is Maple Its like white as snow when you finish and expensive
20-06-2018T20:43:11,Vatruvius,Hmm...
20-06-2018T20:44:56,BluePhantom90,plus you would cut a maple tree down where you could make Maple syrup or make something out of it
20-06-2018T20:45:21,Vatruvius,Bamboo?
20-06-2018T20:45:43,CrRAR,bamboo only exists in planks as a laminate
20-06-2018T20:45:43,BluePhantom90,never worked with that
20-06-2018T20:47:32,Vatruvius,"Not exactly, I have seen layered bammboo so it is the real thing."
20-06-2018T20:48:28,CrRAR,"yeah, I know but that's what I mean like it has to be layered and bonded or whatever."
20-06-2018T20:51:29,Vatruvius,"Yeah, because bamboo does not grow like a regular tree."
20-06-2018T20:52:44,CrRAR,yeah big 'ol hole in the middle~
20-06-2018T20:53:09,CrRAR,:ok_hand:
20-06-2018T20:53:26,BluePhantom90,hmm Tom you there?
20-06-2018T20:54:32,CrRAR,he's gotta be... this discussion of wood is SO enthralling~
20-06-2018T20:54:37,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:
20-06-2018T20:55:26,BluePhantom90,oh just wanted to get more lore from Tk world.
20-06-2018T20:55:42,Vatruvius,I just daw the Adria daki...for some reason the tiny detail of her underwear being beside her just makes more...:ctwokinds-MikeLewd:
20-06-2018T20:55:59,BluePhantom90,heh
20-06-2018T20:56:06,CrRAR,;3
20-06-2018T20:56:08,Vatruvius,:ctwokinds-KeithNeat:
20-06-2018T20:56:31,CrRAR,so beautiful~
20-06-2018T20:56:36,BluePhantom90,I just can't wait for the Last sketch.
20-06-2018T20:57:26,CrRAR,MASSIVE feels~
20-06-2018T20:57:32,BluePhantom90,yes
20-06-2018T20:57:47,BluePhantom90,but wonder If therie might have a sister
20-06-2018T20:58:03,BluePhantom90,or cousin look alike
20-06-2018T20:58:05,Vatruvius,Ohh...I couldn't stay for the end of the stream so...this should be interesting.
20-06-2018T20:58:32,Vatruvius,Wait...more Therie and Daniels?
20-06-2018T20:58:52,CrRAR,I think Keidran siblings are quite likely considering their... promiscuity.
20-06-2018T20:59:04,CrRAR,Yeah Vat.
20-06-2018T20:59:53,CrRAR,The Therie x Daniels saga went light speed real quick.
20-06-2018T20:59:59,Vatruvius,Potentially though the only Keirdran siblings we know of is Zen and Natani I believe...maybe one of the tigers mentioned a sister.
20-06-2018T21:00:36,BluePhantom90,Well there is a Tiger girl I think that looks like Therie just slightly different
20-06-2018T21:01:29,Vatruvius,I am a little sick of tge Therie x Daniels thing...I think it has been a little over done...I don't know.
20-06-2018T21:02:07,CrRAR,well look away just a lil' longer and they'll be in rocking chairs~
20-06-2018T21:02:16,CrRAR,...or at least Therie will.
20-06-2018T21:02:19,BluePhantom90,well we have got a hint of the baby. SO possibility for idea of Trace and Flora's baby
20-06-2018T21:02:20,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-LauraCry:
20-06-2018T21:02:30,CrRAR,yeah
20-06-2018T21:04:16,BluePhantom90,the tiger girl from this page looks like Therie so wonder if it could be her sister http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/919/
20-06-2018T21:04:53,CrRAR,oh yeah lol
20-06-2018T21:05:25,CrRAR,The face expression reminds me of Mike a little for some reason. xD
20-06-2018T21:05:32,BluePhantom90,yeah
20-06-2018T21:06:36,CrRAR,That was a great page
20-06-2018T21:07:18,CrRAR,Not to mention :ctwokinds-renirawr:
20-06-2018T21:07:31,CrRAR,made a firey entrance two pages later
20-06-2018T21:08:50,BluePhantom90,Also wonder how the Keidran pregnancy is like. Like animal or humans
20-06-2018T21:09:57,CrRAR,In what way? By count... like humans.
20-06-2018T21:10:37,CrRAR,"Didn't Flora mention a brother or sister earlier on... that was brought up in the story about the ""special milk""."
20-06-2018T21:10:44,BluePhantom90,Humans are 9months Tigers are 105 days
20-06-2018T21:11:08,BluePhantom90,about 5 months for tigers
20-06-2018T21:11:23,CrRAR,Here... Flora at least has a sister. http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/64/
20-06-2018T21:11:58,CrRAR,"ohhh length, yeahhhh about thattt"
20-06-2018T21:11:59,BluePhantom90,"yeah, I mean we met Flora's mother"
20-06-2018T21:12:09,CrRAR,yus
20-06-2018T21:12:57,BluePhantom90,should do one with Flora's mom trying to get Trace in bed with her with Flora's tail all fluffed up
20-06-2018T21:14:10,Vatruvius,"But that is not canon. Also, I wany Flora's sister to pop up now."
20-06-2018T21:14:10,CrRAR,TWO fluff tails!?
20-06-2018T21:14:15,CrRAR,you madman
20-06-2018T21:14:22,CrRAR,lol Vat
20-06-2018T21:14:37,BluePhantom90,well get someone to post the sketch idea
20-06-2018T21:14:48,Vatruvius,"Umm, my comment is not in relation to Blue's."
20-06-2018T21:15:08,BluePhantom90,Or maybe we will see Flora's sister later. Flora never said she is dead
20-06-2018T21:15:35,CrRAR,surprise sisters are best sisters!
20-06-2018T21:15:48,Vatruvius,"And Blue, there has already been a sketch/color/april fools/thing where Trace meets Flora's mom."
20-06-2018T21:15:52,CrRAR,...except if... you're Kat.
20-06-2018T21:15:57,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:
20-06-2018T21:16:32,Vatruvius,Poor Kat...now Eric will have someone to go for that looks like Kat but just isn't named Kat.

20-06-2018T21:17:02,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
20-06-2018T21:17:11,Twokinds,That'd be hilarious if Kat had a twin sister who Eric had no qualms about trying to woo
20-06-2018T21:17:42,CrRAR,We need a little Eric emoji with a sparkle off his glasses for these moments xD
20-06-2018T21:17:49,BluePhantom90,oh god Kat would kill Eric
20-06-2018T21:18:00,CrRAR,prolly the sister too
20-06-2018T21:18:11,BluePhantom90,yes

20-06-2018T21:19:43,CrRAR,sounds soild so far in my mind
20-06-2018T21:20:27,Vatruvius,Kat twin sister both Eric and Zen woo...upset Kat in background.

20-06-2018T21:22:05,CrRAR,I wonder how Kat's sister would be different? :thinking:
20-06-2018T21:22:21,BluePhantom90,"longer hair, and more fluffy"
20-06-2018T21:22:33,Vatruvius,"I will love that ip to Tom, but different name obviously."

20-06-2018T21:24:16,CrRAR,"Haha, Kat loses it and grows out her hair to imitate a dust-cloud cartoon tussle fight ensues, when they come out Eric likes the odds of a 50-50 choice... only real Kat knows the outcome~"
20-06-2018T21:24:45,CrRAR,I call it... Schrodinger's sister

20-06-2018T21:25:49,Vatruvius,Hmm...Kat grows out her hair and comes to Eric as Kat's long lost twin sister...Eric ask for a date.
20-06-2018T21:26:15,CrRAR,xD
20-06-2018T21:27:01,CrRAR,"Cleverr, cutting out the middle ma... err Kat."
20-06-2018T21:27:16,CrRAR,I like the cut of your jib! Yur HIRED!
20-06-2018T21:28:34,Vatruvius,"lol...Eric hires Kat's twin sister, Kat disguising herself, and goes to tell Kat that her services are no longer required..."
20-06-2018T21:32:13,CrRAR,HAHA
20-06-2018T21:32:16,CrRAR,*haha
20-06-2018T21:32:56,BluePhantom90,was wondering Tom if you would talk a little more about the Tiger society
20-06-2018T21:33:26,Vatruvius,"Kat's twin, aka Kat, breaks down in tears beside Eric as he is trying to tell Kat this."
20-06-2018T21:34:33,Twokinds,Tiger society mostly consists of tigers.
20-06-2018T21:35:09,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
20-06-2018T21:35:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Reeeaaally
20-06-2018T21:35:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Never would’ve guessed
20-06-2018T21:35:26,BluePhantom90,"well yes, but more about the ranking and and since tigers only eat meat do they have speical hunters or farmers?"
20-06-2018T21:35:31,Vatruvius,:ctwokinds-RaineEep:
20-06-2018T21:36:17,CrRAR,"That's quite a developing scene, especially if Kat's sister's moods swing unexpectedly Vat."
20-06-2018T21:36:46,CrRAR,"One second happy as a clam, next bawling at the SADNESS~"
20-06-2018T21:36:47,Twokinds,Tiger society isn't completely formed yet.
20-06-2018T21:37:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Still a developing country?
20-06-2018T21:37:16,CrRAR,They're tribalish?
20-06-2018T21:37:19,BluePhantom90,So no form or government or Monarchy?
20-06-2018T21:37:34,Twokinds,But it's very class-based. There's a lot of emphases on class and social structure.
20-06-2018T21:37:49,Twokinds,"Clans, lots of clan."
20-06-2018T21:37:55,Twokinds,caravans
20-06-2018T21:38:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Iris sure seems to see herself as high order
20-06-2018T21:39:19,BluePhantom90,So Clans and Class. Like what are the Classes?
20-06-2018T21:39:58,Twokinds,It's a matriarchy. Very female dominated.

20-06-2018T21:46:41,Twokinds,The tiger capital is like the fabled El Dorado to humans. Not many have found it and lived to tell.

20-06-2018T21:52:55,Bgrmystr2,No wonder the humans can't find it. Not even the creator of the world knows where it is.
20-06-2018T21:53:07,BluePhantom90,"heh alright. Well what about the Rare defects ones. White, Golden, and Red tigers?"

20-06-2018T21:58:09,BluePhantom90,heh My character's gf Sapphire has heart shaped stripes. so most likely really loved
20-06-2018T21:58:36,Twokinds,Some tigers are quite strange. There are groups that shave their bodies to look more like humans.
20-06-2018T21:58:54,BluePhantom90,that is interesting.
20-06-2018T21:59:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Are they technically nudists?
20-06-2018T21:59:22,Twokinds,lol
20-06-2018T21:59:31,iliar,Shaved cat... What could be worse?
20-06-2018T21:59:38,Twokinds,"I suppose. Tigers are very isolations, so humans are hugely exotic to them."
20-06-2018T21:59:45,SpazztasticKiwi,The amount of shaving that must take...
20-06-2018T22:00:04,BluePhantom90,I mean they wanted to know if Humans have tails
20-06-2018T22:00:21,CrRAR,#teamfleshie
20-06-2018T22:00:55,Twokinds,They see humans as very ugly. But some tigers like ugly.
20-06-2018T22:01:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Ugly is the new sexy
20-06-2018T22:01:13,iliar,"I think shaved tigers will wear clothes. Without wool, the skin of cats is too sensitive to leave it without protection."
20-06-2018T22:01:22,BluePhantom90,well to Therie yes
20-06-2018T22:01:51,Twokinds,"Well, the jungles and forests of tiger territory are very damp."
20-06-2018T22:02:00,Twokinds,So shaving might actually be better.
20-06-2018T22:02:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Dear God the sweat
20-06-2018T22:02:28,BluePhantom90,well you do know Tiger stripes are even on their skin right?

20-06-2018T22:03:58,CrRAR,a civilization offshoot was born
20-06-2018T22:04:09,Twokinds,A lot of tigers will assume a shaved tiger is an actor.
20-06-2018T22:04:31,BluePhantom90,So what if they see a human with Tiger stripes like them?
20-06-2018T22:04:57,iliar,"No. This is not how fur works. In addition to the warming function, it serves as a protection against damage. Just try to go through a thick forest without clothes. Your entire body will be covered with cuts and scratches."
20-06-2018T22:05:07,Twokinds,Because a lot of plays that portray humans use shaved tigers.
20-06-2018T22:05:37,CrRAR,oh... um interesting
20-06-2018T22:05:58,CrRAR,Who knew they had a knack for theatrics?
20-06-2018T22:06:19,CrRAR,Are these roles voluntary?
20-06-2018T22:06:40,SpazztasticKiwi,“That’s one ugly costume”
20-06-2018T22:06:40,Twokinds,Well... theatre is a common form of entertainment.
20-06-2018T22:07:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"“That’s an actor, actually”"
20-06-2018T22:07:35,Twokinds,They don't have the internet.
20-06-2018T22:07:37,BluePhantom90,So tom what if they saw humans with Tiger stripes like them? Besides that one human girl
20-06-2018T22:07:48,Twokinds,Uh...

20-06-2018T22:17:26,BluePhantom90,Well some don't have head hair.
20-06-2018T22:18:01,BluePhantom90,Therie's hair is more like her fur grew into a pony tail.
20-06-2018T22:18:20,Vatruvius,That is true.
20-06-2018T22:20:09,BluePhantom90,and Keiths hair is more like his fur just grown out to be like head hair. BUT Keiths father I don't think had head hair.
20-06-2018T22:21:10,Vatruvius,"Yup, though there tends to be a limit on fur length so it would still count as head hair no?"
20-06-2018T22:22:24,Twokinds,"Uh, I dunno."
20-06-2018T22:22:42,Twokinds,Some do some don't.
20-06-2018T22:23:24,Twokinds,"Most East Basitins have the same hair color as fur color, as opposed to Keideran, who tend to have different hair to fur color."
20-06-2018T22:23:31,Twokinds,But there's always exceptions.
20-06-2018T22:23:31,BluePhantom90,"Okay so would Tiger Caravans allow other Felines to Travel with them? Like lions, or lynxes bobcats and so on?"
20-06-2018T22:24:02,Twokinds,"Sure, possibly."
20-06-2018T22:26:35,BluePhantom90,hmm would be interesting to see other Felines come to the Town

20-06-2018T22:45:55,Bgrmystr2,and people
20-06-2018T22:46:02,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s a good one
20-06-2018T22:46:05,Bgrmystr2,:v
20-06-2018T22:46:22,MidNightBlue78,and plastic wrap
20-06-2018T22:46:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Reheated coffee makes me think of hotel coffee
20-06-2018T22:46:29,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, I like black licorice"
20-06-2018T22:46:47,CrRAR,Acquired taste~
20-06-2018T22:46:48,MidNightBlue78,Of course you like black licorice
20-06-2018T22:46:50,Bgrmystr2,lolo
20-06-2018T22:46:59,MidNightBlue78,you like nasty candy
20-06-2018T22:47:03,Bgrmystr2,that's the only thing I'm different about on that list
20-06-2018T22:47:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Hotel coffee is like making love in a canoe
20-06-2018T22:47:05,MidNightBlue78,like candy corn
20-06-2018T22:47:08,Bgrmystr2,"and that's not true, I like good candy"
20-06-2018T22:47:13,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s fucking close to water
20-06-2018T22:47:39,Bgrmystr2,"also, candy corn is kinda eh now"
20-06-2018T22:47:44,Twokinds,lol
20-06-2018T22:47:46,Bgrmystr2,still like the lil pumpkins tho
20-06-2018T22:47:50,MidNightBlue78,hotel coffee tastes like someone washed their ass and rinsed it inside the pot
20-06-2018T22:47:59,Twokinds,I don't reheat coffee
20-06-2018T22:47:59,CrRAR,Moxie soda literally tastes like liqified black licorice.
20-06-2018T22:48:06,Twokinds,I like room temp coffee.
20-06-2018T22:48:11,BluePhantom90,Hey Tom wondering. What about the Snow Leopards. I mean what happen to their land. And are the Snow Leopards like Nomads as well?
20-06-2018T22:48:11,CrRAR,You like that bgr?
20-06-2018T22:48:19,Bgrmystr2,I don't even know what that is
20-06-2018T22:48:20,Bgrmystr2,so..
20-06-2018T22:48:25,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
20-06-2018T22:48:37,Bgrmystr2,I don't drink sodas of any type
20-06-2018T22:48:48,Bgrmystr2,no soft drinks.
20-06-2018T22:48:51,MidNightBlue78,"Tom, when your coffee gets cold just add ice"
20-06-2018T22:48:59,MidNightBlue78,That's what i do
20-06-2018T22:49:04,CrRAR,"Haha, it exists. Orange label with an old timey dude just pointing at 'cha."
20-06-2018T22:49:11,CrRAR,"Ahh, okok"
20-06-2018T22:49:12,MidNightBlue78,I drink hot coffee in the morning
20-06-2018T22:49:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Room temp coffee.
20-06-2018T22:49:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Anyone ever tell you you’re odd?
20-06-2018T22:49:28,Bgrmystr2,you guys and your coffee
20-06-2018T22:49:35,MidNightBlue78,And the rest of the day i drink iced coffee
20-06-2018T22:49:46,CrRAR,Good plan
20-06-2018T22:50:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I drink tea more than coffee
20-06-2018T22:50:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Mainly because my mom doesn’t like coffee in the house
20-06-2018T22:50:26,SpazztasticKiwi,She hates it
20-06-2018T22:50:44,MidNightBlue78,how can she do coffee like that?
20-06-2018T22:50:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Eh
20-06-2018T22:50:52,MidNightBlue78,That's mean
20-06-2018T22:50:57,Twokinds,"I drink it so slowly, aquiring a taste for lukewarm coffee was a necessity"
20-06-2018T22:51:10,MidNightBlue78,you'll hurt the coffee's feelings
20-06-2018T22:51:11,SpazztasticKiwi,My dad was the coffee drinker. Got it from him
20-06-2018T22:51:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Got a lot of things from him actually
20-06-2018T22:51:38,Twokinds,Man I used to drink a crazy amount of tea.
20-06-2018T22:51:45,Twokinds,"Like, I went through a huge tea phase."
20-06-2018T22:51:51,SpazztasticKiwi,What kind?
20-06-2018T22:51:52,MidNightBlue78,"so, your coffee is all stagnant"
20-06-2018T22:52:24,MidNightBlue78,I have tried to switch to drinking tea
20-06-2018T22:52:34,MidNightBlue78,But i just can't do it
20-06-2018T22:52:47,Twokinds,"Nothing fancy, just Lipton"
20-06-2018T22:53:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"I drink strong green tea. Like, three or four baggies a cup"
20-06-2018T22:53:10,Twokinds,The phase was mostly because I found a sale that let me buy 1000 tea packets for really really cheap.
20-06-2018T22:53:17,Bgrmystr2,xDD
20-06-2018T22:53:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I did something similar a few days ago
20-06-2018T22:53:36,MidNightBlue78,That's just torture
20-06-2018T22:54:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I also don’t use honey or milk or sugar
20-06-2018T22:55:01,MidNightBlue78,unsweetened!?
20-06-2018T22:55:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Yes
20-06-2018T22:55:10,Twokinds,"No, no, no"
20-06-2018T22:55:18,MidNightBlue78,awww hell no!!!
20-06-2018T22:55:19,Twokinds,That's just wrong.
20-06-2018T22:55:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Like my coffee when I drink it
20-06-2018T22:55:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I am my dad’s daughter
20-06-2018T22:55:52,MidNightBlue78,I'm getting nausea just thinking about it
20-06-2018T22:56:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I don’t put liquor in mine
20-06-2018T22:56:59,CrRAR,"Tea is my goto still, dizzying amounts of it."
20-06-2018T22:57:14,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-katdryer:
20-06-2018T22:57:15,MidNightBlue78,"wait, people put liquor in their tea!?"
20-06-2018T22:57:22,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-katdryer:
20-06-2018T22:57:25,SpazztasticKiwi,My dad put it in his coffee
20-06-2018T22:57:41,SpazztasticKiwi,:ctwokinds-katdryer: teeeeeeeeaaaaaa
20-06-2018T22:58:05,MidNightBlue78,i have never tried liquor in my coffee
20-06-2018T22:58:31,SpazztasticKiwi,He left it in my reach once when I was little. It’s nasty
20-06-2018T22:58:37,MidNightBlue78,I just too afraid of what caffeine and alcohol together might do to me
20-06-2018T22:58:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Sout
20-06-2018T22:58:41,CrRAR,Baileys for coffee
20-06-2018T22:58:42,SpazztasticKiwi,*sour
20-06-2018T22:59:34,MidNightBlue78,drunk and shaking all at the same time
20-06-2018T23:00:11,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake:
20-06-2018T23:00:15,SpazztasticKiwi,He wasn’t supposed to be drinking it. His meds explicitly said “no alcohol”
20-06-2018T23:00:25,SpazztasticKiwi,But he wasn’t one to listen well
20-06-2018T23:00:36,MidNightBlue78,men never listen to anyone
20-06-2018T23:00:52,MidNightBlue78,they have selective hearing
20-06-2018T23:01:02,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s why women live longer :ptv-snicker:
20-06-2018T23:01:49,CrRAR,Tru facts
20-06-2018T23:01:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I don’t actually put too much faith in that troupe
20-06-2018T23:02:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve met some....interesting women too
20-06-2018T23:04:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw a tiny calico kitten on the road yesterday by the way
20-06-2018T23:04:16,SpazztasticKiwi,It would come up to me though
20-06-2018T23:04:22,SpazztasticKiwi,*wouldnt
20-06-2018T23:04:31,CrRAR,nuuuu ;_;
20-06-2018T23:05:21,CrRAR,Poor little fella
20-06-2018T23:05:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve got the most one track mind sometimes
20-06-2018T23:05:49,SpazztasticKiwi,It was most likely a girl if it was a calico actually
20-06-2018T23:06:11,CrRAR,*Poor little fellette
20-06-2018T23:06:18,SpazztasticKiwi,The genes required to make a calico make it nearly impossible for them to be male
20-06-2018T23:07:15,CrRAR,Boy tonight has been chock-full of cat facts~
20-06-2018T23:07:59,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s also said that black cats are most likely to be male too but I’m not sure on that one
20-06-2018T23:08:24,MidNightBlue78,I've always wanted a black cat
20-06-2018T23:08:29,CrRAR,"Mmm, those crazy punnett squares."
20-06-2018T23:08:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Dude
20-06-2018T23:08:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I currently have a black kitten looking for a home
20-06-2018T23:09:12,CrRAR,"Box it, mail it, stick it in a stew~"
20-06-2018T23:09:19,CrRAR,...Wait
20-06-2018T23:09:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Excuse me
20-06-2018T23:09:30,CrRAR,xD
20-06-2018T23:09:57,MidNightBlue78,I will end up in the streets if i bring another cat xD
20-06-2018T23:10:08,SpazztasticKiwi,How many you got?
20-06-2018T23:10:37,MidNightBlue78,"I only have one, a female. The male died last year"
20-06-2018T23:10:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Awww
20-06-2018T23:11:04,MidNightBlue78,and i would need to declaw it
20-06-2018T23:11:08,SpazztasticKiwi,We have 6 in the house but just two are mine
20-06-2018T23:11:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Declawing is like taking a finger joint off
20-06-2018T23:11:50,MidNightBlue78,yeah i know
20-06-2018T23:12:04,SpazztasticKiwi,And two more are the kittens we’ve found
20-06-2018T23:12:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Jellybean and Cheeto Sherbert
20-06-2018T23:14:44,MidNightBlue78,Cheeto sherbert is quite an interesting name
20-06-2018T23:16:55,MidNightBlue78,if i ever do get another cat i will name it Tiramisú
20-06-2018T23:17:46,BadFoMo,"Hey, Tom, if you're still here; are there magically enhanced plants in TwoKinds?"
20-06-2018T23:18:49,Twokinds,I feel like I remember this question before...
20-06-2018T23:18:53,Twokinds,"But yes, probably."
20-06-2018T23:18:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Mine are Kiwi and Bagheera
20-06-2018T23:19:05,Twokinds,"I mean, subtleseed plants for one"
20-06-2018T23:19:52,MidNightBlue78,We haven't seen the subtleseed in a while
20-06-2018T23:21:22,Bgrmystr2,It's prolly still under Flora's fur
20-06-2018T23:21:31,Bgrmystr2,but it hasn't glowed for a while so..
20-06-2018T23:21:36,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
20-06-2018T23:21:55,BadFoMo,"Yeah, I asked if there were any man-eating plants like the Pit of Carkoon. Sorry."
20-06-2018T23:22:14,MidNightBlue78,i bet she doesn't even remember she has it
20-06-2018T23:22:29,Dadrobit,"I postulated a while back that the crystal was lost in the tavern fire on the Basitin Isles, but no, she still has it."
20-06-2018T23:22:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t think anyone remembers she has it
20-06-2018T23:22:49,MidNightBlue78,but i have a feeling that this necklace will make an epic reappearance
20-06-2018T23:23:31,Dadrobit,"Since the last time we saw it was just before she got the Kat massage, and then never, not even a glow was seen again after it."
20-06-2018T23:23:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Dadro using his “word a day” calendar
20-06-2018T23:24:03,MidNightBlue78,It went dormant
20-06-2018T23:24:14,Dadrobit,"Nah, word of the day is crepuscularity."
20-06-2018T23:24:30,SpazztasticKiwi,What a sneeze
20-06-2018T23:24:40,MidNightBlue78,Or maybe it already did the job it was supposed to do
20-06-2018T23:24:58,MidNightBlue78,which was...
20-06-2018T23:26:50,Dadrobit,"It had two functions. Mood ring, and Demi God slaying."
20-06-2018T23:26:56,Dadrobit,Highly functional really.
20-06-2018T23:27:02,BadFoMo,Flora: Hmm? (Pulls Subtleseed out of her floof.) ...What is this and how long has it been here?
20-06-2018T23:27:47,SpazztasticKiwi,That thing’s gonna be flashing like a strobe light while she’s pregnant
20-06-2018T23:28:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"“I’m hot, I’m cold, I’m hungry, I’m tired”"
20-06-2018T23:28:54,Dadrobit,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/390/ The final sighting of the necklace outside of the Mind Probe by Reni.
20-06-2018T23:29:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"It pipes up like “dear God, woman, make up your mind”"
20-06-2018T23:30:09,BadFoMo,Wait! What if the Subtleseed is causing her to stay flat/get flatter?!
20-06-2018T23:30:39,Dadrobit,As in that it's deceptively massive and it
20-06-2018T23:30:50,Dadrobit,it's gravitational pull is restricting her growth?
20-06-2018T23:31:34,SpazztasticKiwi,We’ll see if she experiences any growth during pregnancy or not
20-06-2018T23:32:13,Bgrmystr2,"definitely not a mood ring anymore, considering she's gone through lots of moods and it hasn't lit up once since then"
20-06-2018T23:32:47,Bgrmystr2,it's probably much more complex than that
20-06-2018T23:33:03,SpazztasticKiwi,“Is that a mood necklace in your fluff or are you happy to see me?”
20-06-2018T23:33:32,Bgrmystr2,xD
20-06-2018T23:33:45,Bgrmystr2,"""No, trace, it's just really cold out.."""
20-06-2018T23:33:48,Bgrmystr2,;v
20-06-2018T23:34:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Sweet Jesus
20-06-2018T23:34:12,Dadrobit,"Yeah, another thoiught that's been brought up was that it was neutralized in the tower explosion and is now little more than a bauble."
20-06-2018T23:34:32,SpazztasticKiwi,But a pretty bauble
20-06-2018T23:34:48,Dadrobit,"Though there were moments before the explosion that should have had it changing colors, it's a fair enough explanation."
20-06-2018T23:35:50,Dadrobit,"Also, it would present a good opportunity for Trace and Flora's re-establisment of marriage for him to present to her a new one if the old one is busted."
20-06-2018T23:36:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Have one made into some sort of engagement necklace or so
20-06-2018T23:36:34,Bgrmystr2,or he could repair it with magic
20-06-2018T23:36:55,BadFoMo,Maybe its 'batteries' are dead.
20-06-2018T23:37:33,BadFoMo,Oh! What if it's doing something with the Baby?!
20-06-2018T23:43:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Just watched so
20-06-2018T23:43:49,SpazztasticKiwi,some vidcon stories
20-06-2018T23:44:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Vidcon trip sounds good rn
