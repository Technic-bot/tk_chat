23-06-2018T03:29:53,JamesBSquirrel3,"Hey Tom are you in there? Just let you know the message was:""I see that sketch earlier of her wings suppose to be. Maybe it shouldn't Tom carry away but it isn't easy a thing"". So that's a message! If you want to properly her wings later on if you want?"
23-06-2018T03:32:55,JamesBSquirrel3,But your now on Sunday Vote Sketches! Maybe some other time by next Latest Comic new Page + finished off of Lady Nora Wings at next Friday Nights Art! It's up to you(?).:ptv-snicker:
23-06-2018T03:35:00,JamesBSquirrel3,"I'll be Back in under 12 hours time, 'kay!:ptv-victory:"
23-06-2018T03:44:23,iliar,@JamesBSquirrel3 In Tom's time zone 5AM now. I'm pretty sure he asleep.
23-06-2018T03:45:01,iliar,Nora's wings already completed.
23-06-2018T03:45:34,iliar,Today will be a sketch stream.
23-06-2018T03:47:50,Bgrmystr2,"ah you already got it then, Iliar?"
23-06-2018T03:53:30,iliar,Of course. As Nora Card holder I have access to original files and I see every changas.
23-06-2018T03:55:11,iliar,"So, I already have new wallpaper. But work on this Nora Card not fully completed yet."
23-06-2018T03:57:47,Bgrmystr2,lolo
23-06-2018T03:58:06,Bgrmystr2,"so you get all the funny doodles that tom does during the stream that he doesn't show on patreon, huh?"
23-06-2018T03:58:12,Bgrmystr2,&gt;:U
23-06-2018T04:10:22,iliar,If he save them into file. And I have access on to my Nora Card file.
23-06-2018T04:30:07,iliar,But I try to keep these funny doodles from the streams.
23-06-2018T04:30:53,Bgrmystr2,Tom rarely ever saves any of the doodles from the streams
23-06-2018T04:30:57,Bgrmystr2,like.. ever
23-06-2018T04:31:48,Bgrmystr2,so I wasn't sure if he saves them in a different layer
23-06-2018T04:31:49,iliar,https://vk.com/album-24039608_160041446
23-06-2018T04:34:02,Bgrmystr2,that's awesome
23-06-2018T05:56:47,JamesBSquirrel3,"@iliar WHAT??? Impossible! How does he do it own?! Without a stream, this could conievence."
23-06-2018T06:07:10,JamesBSquirrel3,I guess Tom was exhausted after all his done of all Lady Nora's Wings it is completed. I suppose I let Tom to take it easy otherwise it don't want to end up being this. So I let it no harm on this as his done far enough.
23-06-2018T06:10:53,Xexanoth,@James tom actually works a lot on sketches/pics outside of the stream(especially background)
23-06-2018T06:10:56,iliar,How often draws without stream.
23-06-2018T06:11:09,Xexanoth,"well, that was perfectly timed XD"
23-06-2018T06:11:33,iliar,*Tom often draws without стрима.
23-06-2018T06:11:40,iliar,Shit
23-06-2018T06:14:06,iliar,Writing messages from the phone on the go is not the best idea.
23-06-2018T06:14:12,Xexanoth,autocorrect: making us look like stroke victims since 2007

23-06-2018T14:26:55,RimaDraws,the new form of politics to avoid now: syrup politics

23-06-2018T14:29:10,RimaDraws,well still
23-06-2018T14:29:16,Bgrmystr2,there was a reason moonshine is illegal
23-06-2018T14:29:21,RimaDraws,its a law to not make moonshine or you can get arrested
23-06-2018T14:29:23,Bgrmystr2,it has negative properties

23-06-2018T14:33:12,CrRAR,Which is why there are the laws on commercialization/limits on high uncontrollable output.

23-06-2018T22:08:06,Dadrobit,Ænima and everything they've put out since is mind blowingly good. It's really where they came into their own with masterclass mixing.

23-06-2018T22:08:40,SpazztasticKiwi,She’s often drawn as a nude woman (or with a veil) with the scales of Justice

23-06-2018T23:29:48,CrRAR,"I'll look at that one, piqes my interest."
23-06-2018T23:30:22,SpazztasticKiwi,The World is about travel and broadenment
23-06-2018T23:34:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"Learning, as opposed to the Tower’s known"
23-06-2018T23:36:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Everyone taking good notes?
23-06-2018T23:36:55,CrRAR,iiiiinteresting
23-06-2018T23:37:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you consider Eric to be in a state of suspension in his life, I’d call his card to be the Hanged Man"
23-06-2018T23:39:48,CrRAR,"True, Eric has some introspecting to do."
23-06-2018T23:40:08,Ordithus,His world was turned upside down by this little vacation
23-06-2018T23:40:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Him being the Hanged Man can also mean he is about to come to terms with losing something
23-06-2018T23:41:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Something very near to him
23-06-2018T23:41:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Or someone
23-06-2018T23:41:18,Ordithus,He did lose the boat already
23-06-2018T23:42:12,SpazztasticKiwi,The Hanged Man isn’t about losing possessions. It can be coming to terms with something that’s been obvious to everyone but the person
23-06-2018T23:42:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Like a parent not realizing their child is becoming more and more distant
23-06-2018T23:42:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Until they run away and are never seen again
23-06-2018T23:43:12,Ordithus,Hmm... well there is an obvious one
23-06-2018T23:43:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"As I said, his best fit is probably the Hanged Man"
23-06-2018T23:45:20,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s only 22 major tarot so matching everyone up is going to be an issue
23-06-2018T23:45:37,SpazztasticKiwi,But there’s a few obvious ones in the main group
23-06-2018T23:45:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Like Flora
23-06-2018T23:49:11,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl: That is the most thorough explanation for a sketch suggestion I've ever seen
23-06-2018T23:49:23,CrRAR,Ahh yes Flora bringing pervs to justice one transgression at a time.
23-06-2018T23:49:45,Ordithus,Thanks for the learnin'
23-06-2018T23:49:52,CrRAR,"ooo it started raining out here, I love rainy summer nights~"
23-06-2018T23:50:23,unsteddyphoenix,Some people write looong suggstion descriptions apparently
23-06-2018T23:50:40,SiliconCarbide,"gah! 2nd place 2 weeks in a row, that stings"
23-06-2018T23:51:05,CrRAR,Eric fraternizes with wolves: a thesis.
23-06-2018T23:52:12,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
23-06-2018T23:52:23,MallardDuckAvia,I’m back. What’s going on?
23-06-2018T23:52:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Yep
23-06-2018T23:52:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Totally including all of this in the suggestion description
23-06-2018T23:53:02,unsteddyphoenix,Lol

23-06-2018T23:54:06,Twokinds,"No, I just assume everything you're all typing."
23-06-2018T23:54:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Suuuuure
23-06-2018T23:54:23,unsteddyphoenix,We're all extremely predictable
23-06-2018T23:54:24,iliar,How about audio books?
23-06-2018T23:54:29,CrRAR,"Ahhhh, explains SO MUCH!"
23-06-2018T23:54:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I call bs
23-06-2018T23:55:06,MallardDuckAvia,Hey Tom. Is Sealeen ever going to become a main character in the comic along with Landen?
23-06-2018T23:55:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not predictable at all
23-06-2018T23:55:13,CrRAR,His superpower is actually just timing quazi-relevant quips
23-06-2018T23:55:20,Twokinds,"Probably not a ""main"" character no"
23-06-2018T23:55:25,Twokinds,There's a lot of characters as it is
23-06-2018T23:55:29,Twokinds,"But you know, a background character"
23-06-2018T23:55:30,Ordithus,So many
23-06-2018T23:55:33,MallardDuckAvia,Will they show up more often?
23-06-2018T23:55:42,Twokinds,They'll be around
23-06-2018T23:55:55,MallardDuckAvia,When can we see them again?
23-06-2018T23:55:58,unsteddyphoenix,Handy dandy Templar exposition
23-06-2018T23:55:59,SpazztasticKiwi,What are you talking about? There’s not THAT many characters
23-06-2018T23:56:00,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao
23-06-2018T23:56:02,unsteddyphoenix,These questions
23-06-2018T23:56:05,Ordithus,Always watching~
23-06-2018T23:56:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"There’s like, ten"

23-06-2018T23:56:58,MallardDuckAvia,How do I get these emotes?
23-06-2018T23:57:02,Ordithus,"Kiwi, there are 20 on the banner and that isn't even all of them"
23-06-2018T23:57:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Sub
23-06-2018T23:57:10,CrRAR,They're currently positioned in a tree just outside Trace's manor's border.
23-06-2018T23:57:19,MallardDuckAvia,Oh ok. I don’t have money
23-06-2018T23:57:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Is sarcasm a foreign language to you?
23-06-2018T23:57:33,Ordithus,Yes
23-06-2018T23:57:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I know there’s more than ten
23-06-2018T23:57:42,Twokinds,I was actually going to have them show up again
23-06-2018T23:57:44,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-keith8D:
23-06-2018T23:57:56,unsteddyphoenix,but now he's NOT
23-06-2018T23:58:01,SpazztasticKiwi,:ctwokinds-katdryer:
23-06-2018T23:58:13,MallardDuckAvia,Is trace going to find them spying?
23-06-2018T23:58:55,CrRAR,"*glados voice* ""...but they just died, how sad~"""
23-06-2018T23:59:45,iliar,"@Twokinds I slightly changed the art with Nora. In my opinion, your version (right) is a little bit cross-eyed. I move her right eye (left version). What do you think about it? https://yadi.sk/i/M67m5u_O3YMMhe"
23-06-2018T23:59:57,Ordithus,Sealeen decided to pursue a career making novelty potions instead
