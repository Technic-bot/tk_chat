06-10-2018T03:59:51,unsteddyphoenix,:dollar::dollar::dollar::dollar:
06-10-2018T04:01:57,Dadrobit,Feelsgoodman
06-10-2018T04:02:59,Dadrobit,"Usually I end up getting around 3rd place, first time I've won since my brothers in law started hosting Poker night."
06-10-2018T04:04:07,unsteddyphoenix,Oh so you keep going until one persons left?
06-10-2018T04:04:10,unsteddyphoenix,Fun~
06-10-2018T04:04:19,unsteddyphoenix,Noone else plays poker nights
06-10-2018T04:04:47,Dadrobit,"Yeah, $5 buy in. Go until there's only one left with the blinds getting bigger over time."
06-10-2018T04:05:50,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds like a good time
06-10-2018T04:07:05,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it's a pretty good time. A fair bit of drunken shenaniganry tossed in from various players keeps things spicy."
06-10-2018T04:07:27,Dadrobit,"(I don't drink myself, gotta drive home ya know)"
06-10-2018T04:09:42,Dadrobit,"Though you might not have guessed that from how I was playing, fucking missed a big hand by throwing away a flush because I didn't read the cards right."
06-10-2018T04:10:09,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao
06-10-2018T04:10:25,unsteddyphoenix,Ive seen vids of pros doing that before
06-10-2018T04:10:26,unsteddyphoenix,Happens~
06-10-2018T04:11:07,Dadrobit,The entire table just looked at me slack jawed when they saw the cards flip over as I tossed them in.
06-10-2018T04:11:46,Dadrobit,"""Are you sure you're not drunk drobit?"""
06-10-2018T04:12:00,Dadrobit,Asked the dude who was on his sixth Corona.
06-10-2018T04:12:38,unsteddyphoenix,Did they literally call you drobit
06-10-2018T04:13:42,Dadrobit,"No, they call me daddy"
06-10-2018T04:14:48,unsteddyphoenix,Phew. That makes a lot more sense.
06-10-2018T04:16:58,Dadrobit,"Luckily, I was not the only person playing like thundershit tonight, so I got back in."
06-10-2018T04:17:31,Dadrobit,Went from mandatory all in to winning in the last 4 hands. Was a good ending.
06-10-2018T04:18:47,Dadrobit,"Final hands were King-8 over King-3. There was another King on the flop, but nothing else mattered outside of the pocket."
06-10-2018T04:20:49,unsteddyphoenix,Ooh yeah. Rip the K-3
06-10-2018T04:21:35,unsteddyphoenix,Thats unfortunate when someone has the same top pair
06-10-2018T04:22:56,Dadrobit,"It was a torturous up to the River. We were playing the last hand all face up as it was the absolute last hand regardless, and the dealer was intentionally dealing slow as we all waited to see if my opponent would get the 3 for a two pair and win."
06-10-2018T04:24:59,Dadrobit,He was a tiny little bit sour about it. 20 minutes prior and he was looking like the winner for his own first win.
06-10-2018T04:31:43,unsteddyphoenix,Does the same person/people normally win every time
06-10-2018T04:33:58,Dadrobit,One of my brother in laws has taken 4/8 games. I had the pleasure of knocking him out myself this time.
06-10-2018T04:34:08,Dadrobit,The rest of the games have been split.
06-10-2018T04:35:09,Dadrobit,He's got a fair bit of experience compared to the rest of us. Been in a few local tourneys and taken the win in a few.
06-10-2018T04:39:11,unsteddyphoenix,oo cool

06-10-2018T18:36:57,Bgrmystr2,but I'd presume Raine wearing the genderbend collar + the crown would just turn them into Princess Peach.
06-10-2018T18:37:22,Bgrmystr2,"..or a male version, cuz the crown makes it specifically female, yeah?"
06-10-2018T18:37:29,ThingsAreMoving,does it?
06-10-2018T18:37:33,unsteddyphoenix,I think so
06-10-2018T18:37:39,unsteddyphoenix,It turns them into a princess
06-10-2018T18:37:43,Bgrmystr2,yeah
06-10-2018T18:37:45,unsteddyphoenix,And then the collar would gender bend that
06-10-2018T18:37:46,Bgrmystr2,it's specifically female
06-10-2018T18:37:50,Bgrmystr2,so it'd be a prince peach

06-10-2018T18:38:01,ThingsAreMoving,So they'd need to wear them in specific sequence

06-10-2018T18:38:52,Bgrmystr2,cuz the magic on the collar wouldn't disappear simply cuz you put the crown on 2nd

06-10-2018T20:33:56,totallynotTrace,"i always like what he does, just like some more than others XD"
06-10-2018T20:34:36,Ordithus,"Aside from the Slav Squat, yep."
06-10-2018T20:37:53,unsteddyphoenix,That was a dark time
06-10-2018T20:39:37,Twokinds,hahaha
06-10-2018T20:42:25,totallynotTrace,"Slav squat? i dont care what caracter it is, I have to find this"
06-10-2018T20:45:16,totallynotTrace,any idea what it was called? trying to search it on deviant art but not comming up with any results
06-10-2018T20:47:19,Bgrmystr2,Don't recall. It was Trace and Flora though
06-10-2018T20:47:30,Bgrmystr2,was looking in the extras archive
06-10-2018T20:47:35,Bgrmystr2,but it's not under the S's
06-10-2018T20:47:54,Bgrmystr2,it'
06-10-2018T20:48:04,Bgrmystr2,it'll be public on patreon so

06-10-2018T20:48:20,Dadrobit,"I am back, and full of goulash https://i.imgur.com/kI6elH3.jpg"
06-10-2018T20:48:26,Dadrobit,It is a good time
06-10-2018T20:48:56,Ordithus,Maaaan the slave squat is way back
06-10-2018T20:49:39,Bgrmystr2,I tried to put two tags
06-10-2018T20:49:44,Bgrmystr2,but patreon can't handle two tags
06-10-2018T20:49:45,Bgrmystr2,just one
06-10-2018T20:50:16,unsteddyphoenix,nice 'lash

06-10-2018T20:51:23,unsteddyphoenix,The characters just literally saying what Tom was thinking while drawing
06-10-2018T20:51:28,Bgrmystr2,ah that's what it was
06-10-2018T20:51:31,Dadrobit,Why thank you. I will likely be having more of it for another week. Unless one of you wants to come down here and take some away from me.
06-10-2018T20:51:43,unsteddyphoenix,omw
06-10-2018T20:53:33,Ordithus,steals some keys
06-10-2018T20:53:38,Ordithus,:airplane_small:

06-10-2018T20:56:52,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rainehappy: no problem
06-10-2018T20:57:12,unsteddyphoenix,un-thanks for finding that
06-10-2018T20:57:19,Ordithus,ha
06-10-2018T20:58:47,Twokinds,I feel inspired now
06-10-2018T20:58:58,Twokinds,starts drawing Tracksuit Reni
06-10-2018T20:59:14,Ordithus,:ptv-nope:
06-10-2018T20:59:29,unsteddyphoenix,"Ah, blyat"
06-10-2018T20:59:34,unsteddyphoenix,Can she at LEAST be busty
06-10-2018T21:00:06,Ordithus,Completely flat.
06-10-2018T21:00:12,unsteddyphoenix,Noooooooo~
06-10-2018T21:02:59,totallynotTrace,EVEN BETTER
06-10-2018T21:04:36,totallynotTrace,the biggest being
06-10-2018T21:04:49,totallynotTrace,"with the biggest, baggiest tracksuit"
06-10-2018T21:05:02,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
06-10-2018T21:05:20,totallynotTrace,with a HUUUGE bottle of really cheap vodka
06-10-2018T21:07:24,unsteddyphoenix,Can a dragon squat?
06-10-2018T21:07:27,unsteddyphoenix,I guess we'll find out
06-10-2018T21:07:31,totallynotTrace,listening to 90's techno rap stuff on a silver boombox with worn out crackly speakers
06-10-2018T21:07:42,totallynotTrace,one sec
06-10-2018T21:08:09,Bgrmystr2,I have two boomboxes without worn out crackly speakers
06-10-2018T21:08:11,Bgrmystr2,they sound fine
06-10-2018T21:08:16,Bgrmystr2,are they acceptable?
06-10-2018T21:09:13,totallynotTrace,NO
06-10-2018T21:09:25,Bgrmystr2,WHAT :ptv-pouty:
06-10-2018T21:09:36,Bgrmystr2,why
06-10-2018T21:09:47,totallynotTrace,they do not crackle
06-10-2018T21:10:10,totallynotTrace,does it have a tape deck and take at least 4 d cell batteries?
06-10-2018T21:10:19,Bgrmystr2,So? Just because mine don't crackle because I take good care of my shit doesn't mean they should be unacceptable
06-10-2018T21:10:21,Bgrmystr2,and yes actually
06-10-2018T21:10:54,totallynotTrace,then you may still be able to get them to crack and redeem your slav card
06-10-2018T21:11:12,Bgrmystr2,NO I WILL NOT RUIN THEIR MUSICAL INTEGRITY >:TTTTttTtT
06-10-2018T21:11:28,Bgrmystr2,"vibrating flora not withstanding, cuz I can't post her."
06-10-2018T21:11:34,totallynotTrace,bgr i am refering to being in a stereotypical slav squat
06-10-2018T21:11:44,Bgrmystr2,well they need to up their audio game.
06-10-2018T21:11:51,Bgrmystr2,cuz it's not good enough for me
06-10-2018T21:12:33,totallynotTrace,baggy track suit + cheap vodka + worn out boom box = stereotypical slav squat
06-10-2018T21:17:54,totallynotTrace,"ok so going by these two pics, dragon anatomy looks like they should be able to squat"

06-10-2018T21:18:25,totallynotTrace,https://www.deviantart.com/twokinds/art/Adrakist-Trace-673705290
06-10-2018T21:18:59,totallynotTrace,specifially looking at how their legs from the knee down are structured
06-10-2018T21:19:13,totallynotTrace,although thier tail might get in the way
06-10-2018T21:19:49,Bgrmystr2,seems like they'd be fine honestly
06-10-2018T21:20:04,Bgrmystr2,may need to lean forward a bit for weight balance
06-10-2018T21:20:16,Bgrmystr2,but otherwise I think it'd be fine xD
06-10-2018T21:20:49,totallynotTrace,yup
06-10-2018T21:33:16,Ordithus,why are we encouraging this
06-10-2018T21:43:02,totallynotTrace,encouraging what super dragon slav squats?
06-10-2018T21:43:24,unsteddyphoenix,Well just regular dragon
06-10-2018T21:43:29,unsteddyphoenix,Its Reni not Nora
06-10-2018T21:44:37,Bgrmystr2,"Nora's not a super dragon though, she's just a normal dragon. Just happens to be the oldest and most powerful"
06-10-2018T21:44:51,Bgrmystr2,she's not abnormal in any way though.. not that I know of
06-10-2018T21:45:11,Bgrmystr2,other dragons would eventually get to where she is.
06-10-2018T21:45:15,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows: just a little abnormal
06-10-2018T21:45:28,Bgrmystr2,personality not withstanding. :ptv-unimpressed:
06-10-2018T21:45:32,Twokinds,XD
06-10-2018T21:45:49,Bgrmystr2,"point, though."
06-10-2018T21:46:20,totallynotTrace,super compared to standard russian human :/
06-10-2018T21:46:30,Bgrmystr2,"speaking of nora, I really am excite to see when that nora explosion escape is done."
06-10-2018T21:46:37,Bgrmystr2,that's gonna be bad ass
06-10-2018T21:47:43,Ordithus,Aerith is cute <3
06-10-2018T21:47:58,totallynotTrace,so ive been watching the vod of todays TK stream and SpaceX launch in split screen and i find it amazing that we can launch a satalite into orbit in just over 12 minutes
06-10-2018T21:49:04,Bgrmystr2,well yeah
06-10-2018T21:49:16,Bgrmystr2,the longest thing is the preparations
06-10-2018T21:49:33,Bgrmystr2,including planning and building and stuff
06-10-2018T21:49:59,Bgrmystr2,"the launch itself is relatively short, those rockets are monstrously strong."
06-10-2018T21:50:14,Ordithus,Orbit requires going really fast
06-10-2018T21:50:19,Ordithus,So it doesn't take long
06-10-2018T21:50:22,Bgrmystr2,yup
06-10-2018T21:50:34,Dadrobit,So. Are we really gonna get a squatting dragon? I'm honestly not sure if this is a gag or not.
06-10-2018T21:50:43,Bgrmystr2,it's probably a gag
06-10-2018T21:50:52,Ordithus,Maybe.  Maybe not.
06-10-2018T21:51:08,Bgrmystr2,"I don't think we'll get one, but if we do get one, we now know that it is totally possible"
06-10-2018T21:51:11,totallynotTrace,not if you can see into my head. already painted in there
06-10-2018T21:51:18,Ordithus,The voting incentive has been around a while
06-10-2018T21:51:44,unsteddyphoenix,Dragons are so much work to draw
06-10-2018T21:51:50,Bgrmystr2,yeah
06-10-2018T21:51:50,unsteddyphoenix,Surely not
06-10-2018T21:52:18,Dadrobit,"I mean, he could just shitpost a drawing of Reni doing a slav squat in a tracksuit."
06-10-2018T21:52:43,totallynotTrace,ohnestly id be up for that as well
06-10-2018T21:53:03,Ordithus,Seeing it written out so succinct... :ptv-grossedout:
06-10-2018T21:53:40,unsteddyphoenix,:grimacing:
06-10-2018T21:55:22,Ordithus,Watching the recording... Iris :ptv-scilove:

06-10-2018T21:57:42,totallynotTrace,3:51:23
06-10-2018T21:58:12,totallynotTrace,I wish that was the final picture (or an uploaded varient/ download)
06-10-2018T21:59:04,Dadrobit,Now I'm really curious. I just kinda want to see what Tom would come up with a shitpost Reni a la the style of that one round-face Keith picture. You know the one.
06-10-2018T21:59:30,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-reniderp::ctwokinds-keith8D::ctwokinds-reniderp_flip:
06-10-2018T21:59:51,totallynotTrace,10/10 would vote
