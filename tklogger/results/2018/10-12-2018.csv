10-12-2018T00:03:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Only thing really happened to me today was a screaming child at work
10-12-2018T00:03:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Temper tantrum screaming
10-12-2018T00:04:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"I can‚Äôt stand prolong loud noises, let alone tantrum screaming for a long period"
10-12-2018T00:04:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Nite Ord
10-12-2018T00:05:09,SpazztasticKiwi,And yes I realize I say that while also being someone who watches Markiplier and Jacksepticeye regularly
10-12-2018T00:11:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"So why‚Äôd you decide to cut sugar, Tom"
10-12-2018T00:14:53,Twokinds,Well sugar causes health problems if I eat too much so I figured I aughts take care of that
10-12-2018T00:18:54,SpazztasticKiwi,What health problems are you worried about that‚Äôd affect you in your early thirties caused by sugar intake?
10-12-2018T00:19:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"Honestly, the only major one I can think of is weight"
10-12-2018T00:21:29,unsteddyphoenix,Just cut out some other sugar
10-12-2018T00:22:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Or add less to the morning coffee. Or cut how many coffees you have a day
10-12-2018T00:22:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Though also do as you feel

10-12-2018T01:19:29,Vatruvius,"Also, sorry I could not make it to the streams Tom, bin a bit too busy. But I am now done with school so I have loads of time now, except for when I need money...sigh."

10-12-2018T12:36:12,Xexanoth,"aww, so cute"
10-12-2018T13:07:40,CrimsonQuill,This is the spirit of seasonal decoration-Snowmes and Christmas trees!
10-12-2018T13:08:05,CrimsonQuill,"Snowmews, not snowmes. God, what's wrong with my spelling?"
10-12-2018T13:12:35,Xexanoth,apparently a w. :ptv-condescending:
10-12-2018T13:12:55,CrimsonQuill,Definitely.
10-12-2018T13:13:35,Twokinds,Hm...
10-12-2018T13:13:43,CrimsonQuill,"Yes, Tom?"
10-12-2018T13:13:50,Twokinds,"I want Smash, but I don't want to spend 70 dollars"
10-12-2018T13:13:59,CrimsonQuill,Wait for a sale.
10-12-2018T13:14:01,CrimsonQuill,Or...
10-12-2018T13:14:06,CrimsonQuill,Hmmm...
10-12-2018T13:14:09,Twokinds,Nintendo games don't really go on sale much.
10-12-2018T13:14:14,CrimsonQuill,Ah.
10-12-2018T13:14:19,Twokinds,"And I doubt smash will be on sale for a while, if it does."
10-12-2018T13:14:28,iliar,Smash? What is it?
10-12-2018T13:14:29,CrimsonQuill,That's...a dampener.
10-12-2018T13:14:43,CrimsonQuill,I face a similar problem with games I'd like in the price range.
10-12-2018T13:14:55,Twokinds,I don't know if I'd even play it.
10-12-2018T13:14:57,CrimsonQuill,Halo 5 was spoiled for me without me ever being able to play it.
10-12-2018T13:15:03,Twokinds,I think Sage has it.
10-12-2018T13:15:12,CrimsonQuill,He might let you have a go...
10-12-2018T13:15:18,CrimsonQuill,You could go head to head!
10-12-2018T13:15:42,Twokinds,"I think maybe if I get a physical copy, I could sell it later."
10-12-2018T13:16:03,CrimsonQuill,"You would get some of the money back doing that, certainly."
10-12-2018T13:16:50,Xexanoth,"there needs to be some programm where you can buy games, but only pay for them when youa ctually play them"
10-12-2018T13:17:09,Xexanoth,"then again, the video game industry will loose a lot of money that way"
10-12-2018T13:17:43,Twokinds,iliar: Super Smash Bros for Nintendo Switch
10-12-2018T13:18:06,CrimsonQuill,I don't even have a gaming console to speak of...
10-12-2018T13:18:19,CrimsonQuill,I play all console games on my father's Xbox 360.
10-12-2018T13:18:30,iliar,Ok.
10-12-2018T13:18:33,CrimsonQuill,And my computer can't handle a lot of games that I'd like.
10-12-2018T13:18:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you know someone who has it, you can at least test it playing with them"
10-12-2018T13:19:07,iliar,I tried to search. But google says Smash is https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smash!!
10-12-2018T13:19:21,SpazztasticKiwi,What my sister and I did with Sims was pay half each and both play. No need for two copies when downloading the same game
10-12-2018T13:19:44,iliar,I am pretty sure that you are not interested in bad Russian music groups.
10-12-2018T13:20:02,CrimsonQuill,Iliar I think he meant Super Smash Bros 2018
10-12-2018T13:20:08,Twokinds,"Well, the only one I think has it is Sage. And I am not anywhere near Sage."
10-12-2018T13:20:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Welp
10-12-2018T13:20:31,Xexanoth,"depends, do the bands have funny music videos?"
10-12-2018T13:20:44,CrimsonQuill,How far away is Sage exactly?
10-12-2018T13:21:05,CrimsonQuill,I'm curious.
10-12-2018T13:21:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder if Jacks gonna do any videos on it. He‚Äôs a Nintendo guy
10-12-2018T13:22:12,iliar,@Xexanoth I was not interested in this group.
10-12-2018T13:22:13,Twokinds,"Oh shoot, I forgot that playing online requires payments too"
10-12-2018T13:22:14,TorqueEmUp,"Oh yeah, Smash will never go on sale, I guarantee it. XD"
10-12-2018T13:22:29,Twokinds,"Man, I don't want to pay for crappy Nintendo online play"
10-12-2018T13:22:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Isn‚Äôt smash just a fighting like game
10-12-2018T13:22:48,Azumachan,Don't you have a month free or something ?
10-12-2018T13:22:49,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúObjective: survive‚Äù style?
10-12-2018T13:22:53,Xexanoth,"yeah, but you can play online, which requires nintendo online"
10-12-2018T13:23:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Would getting the physical copy require online connection/pay?
10-12-2018T13:24:07,TorqueEmUp,I hear Smash Ultimate's online is still pretty bad anyway.
10-12-2018T13:24:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Wouldn‚Äôt doubt it
10-12-2018T13:24:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"Where unsupervised prepubescent lemurs are loose, slurs can fly"
10-12-2018T13:26:09,TorqueEmUp,"Yes, all Switch games, physical or digital, require a Subscription for the online service to play online."
10-12-2018T13:27:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"Just to play online though - if you want to solo, you can"
10-12-2018T13:27:38,SpazztasticKiwi,..?
10-12-2018T13:28:10,TorqueEmUp,"Of course, that'd be pretty shitty if you couldn't play your games offline without a subscription."
10-12-2018T13:29:09,Twokinds,Smash is only really fun with others
10-12-2018T13:29:30,SpazztasticKiwi,So I‚Äôve heard. Which is why I wonder if jack will ever play it
10-12-2018T13:29:33,Twokinds,"A while ago, I got smash for 3DS and never played it because I had no local friends who had it."
10-12-2018T13:30:01,Twokinds,"I want this, but only if Sage or someone else would be willing to play with me."
10-12-2018T13:30:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"With him being in LA right now, he could do a test run with Ethan or something"
10-12-2018T13:30:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Or Mark
10-12-2018T13:30:48,SpazztasticKiwi,But I don‚Äôt see mark having it
10-12-2018T13:30:58,CrimsonQuill,I wish I could play smash....it sounds fun.
10-12-2018T13:31:07,CrimsonQuill,I wouldn't mind trying a match against you..
10-12-2018T13:31:20,CrimsonQuill,But I have neither the Nintendo nor the skill to play it.
10-12-2018T13:31:23,CrimsonQuill,Nor the funds.
10-12-2018T13:32:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I just don‚Äôt ever really see myself playing games
10-12-2018T13:33:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Don‚Äôt have but my laptop to play anything and there‚Äôs also time
10-12-2018T13:33:24,TorqueEmUp,Smash 4 had very little in terms of Single Player content.
10-12-2018T13:34:03,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, lately my time's become rather limited as well..."
10-12-2018T13:34:12,TorqueEmUp,"I feel Ultimate really improves on that with World of Light, and the revamped Classic mode, and Spirit boards."
10-12-2018T13:34:30,SpazztasticKiwi,CTR reboot gonna be more my focus anyway
10-12-2018T13:35:37,CrimsonQuill,I'm off for a bit. I'll be back later.
10-12-2018T13:35:39,TorqueEmUp,There is a Monster Hunter Boss fight in Ultimate. XD

10-12-2018T13:41:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though Tom, if you go ahead and get the game, you can make new friends"
10-12-2018T13:41:53,SpazztasticKiwi,With online play
10-12-2018T13:47:31,TorqueEmUp,"Snake and Wolf being my mains. Though I can't say I am much good with Wolf right now, i've killed myself with his side-special more than i'd care to admit. lol"

10-12-2018T13:55:27,Twokinds,Hyah-ii!
10-12-2018T13:55:52,Xexanoth,"at least it's not as annoying as Shulks ""Backslash"""
10-12-2018T13:56:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve always seen kirby as a cute blob of warning
10-12-2018T13:56:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Like a demonic care bear
10-12-2018T13:56:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Adorable. But will also cut you
10-12-2018T13:56:58,Xexanoth,some of the kirby games are pretty dark
10-12-2018T14:02:08,Azumachan,"Tom, Check up Patreon"
10-12-2018T14:07:39,Twokinds,Oh?
10-12-2018T14:07:57,Twokinds,What's this?
10-12-2018T14:08:15,Azumachan,something that need to be activated on nitendo.com
10-12-2018T14:08:23,Twokinds,:o

10-12-2018T14:32:17,Twokinds,uh oh
10-12-2018T14:32:21,Twokinds,There seems to be an issue
10-12-2018T14:32:25,Azumachan,oh ?
10-12-2018T14:33:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Well don‚Äôt leave us in suspense
10-12-2018T14:34:14,Twokinds,I cannot seem to get it to work.
10-12-2018T14:34:28,MrMongMong,We are all going to die.
10-12-2018T14:34:36,Azumachan,Uh ?
10-12-2018T14:34:40,MrMongMong,:tired_face:
10-12-2018T14:35:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Get what to work now?
10-12-2018T14:35:48,TerraTheWizard,it
10-12-2018T14:35:51,MrMongMong,It.
10-12-2018T14:35:52,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-katdryer:
10-12-2018T14:35:54,Twokinds,Perhaps... if I change regions
10-12-2018T14:36:10,Azumachan,the switch is region free
10-12-2018T14:36:36,MrMongMong,You could throw it at a wall to let it know you mean business.
10-12-2018T14:37:16,TerraTheWizard,rip wall
10-12-2018T14:37:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Ooooooh
10-12-2018T14:37:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Did you try turning it off and turning it back on
10-12-2018T14:37:56,Twokinds,"I keep getting ""The product associated with that code is not currently available"""
10-12-2018T14:38:32,MrMongMong,"That fixes everything, the off&on method. When people are unproductive, turn them off, then on after about 8 hours, and they work much better from there."
10-12-2018T14:38:34,Azumachan,I'm scared if i activate it with my account it will be linked to it
10-12-2018T14:39:11,Azumachan,maybe i posted it too soon
10-12-2018T14:46:32,Twokinds,I think perhaps europe codes need to be redeemed with a europe region user
10-12-2018T14:48:00,Azumachan,I'm working on something
10-12-2018T14:53:23,Azumachan,I'm sorry for the inconvenience
10-12-2018T14:54:05,SpazztasticKiwi,You triedüéÅ
10-12-2018T14:54:22,Twokinds,I do very much appreciate the attempt
10-12-2018T14:54:33,Twokinds,That's very nice of you.
10-12-2018T14:54:46,Twokinds,I certainly wasn't expecting anything like that.
10-12-2018T14:54:57,SpazztasticKiwi,How much is smash?
10-12-2018T14:55:45,Twokinds,Standard full console game price.
10-12-2018T14:57:32,SpazztasticKiwi,$60?
10-12-2018T14:58:09,Twokinds,Yeah
10-12-2018T14:58:46,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs what it is at my store
10-12-2018T14:58:57,SpazztasticKiwi,But I could also get the discount
10-12-2018T15:02:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"Oh yeah, and I‚Äôve taught Bagheera ‚Äúget in the crate‚Äù"
10-12-2018T15:02:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Kitty now puts self in crate
10-12-2018T15:03:59,Twokinds,Good now teach it to do your taxes
10-12-2018T15:04:31,SpazztasticKiwi,He only has four toes
10-12-2018T15:04:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs good with numbers
10-12-2018T15:08:09,SpazztasticKiwi,And he‚Äôs only 2 years old
10-12-2018T15:08:40,Twokinds,Never too early to learn about the joys of financial responsibility
10-12-2018T15:09:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Well he‚Äôs technically MY dependent
10-12-2018T15:13:30,CrimsonQuill,"Hello, I'm back. What have I missed?"
10-12-2018T15:13:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom thinks cats can do taxes
10-12-2018T15:14:12,Azumachan,Excel is fun
10-12-2018T15:14:12,CrimsonQuill,Cats don't pay taxes.
10-12-2018T15:15:01,CrimsonQuill,"@Azumachan I'm glad you like it, because I can never understand the codes that my lecturer taught us for Geomatics calculations and data stuff."
10-12-2018T15:15:21,Twokinds,I like Excel
10-12-2018T15:15:21,Azumachan,Excel does my taxes
10-12-2018T15:15:26,Twokinds,But I don't know how to use it very well
10-12-2018T15:15:39,Twokinds,"I mean, I'm okay. But the advanced stuff is over my head"
10-12-2018T15:15:49,Twokinds,And I forgot a lot of what I learned in College
10-12-2018T15:16:03,SpazztasticKiwi,You ARE talking about Microsoft excel
10-12-2018T15:16:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Right
10-12-2018T15:16:14,CrimsonQuill,Yes.
10-12-2018T15:16:16,Twokinds,Yes.
10-12-2018T15:16:18,CrimsonQuill,THe very same.
10-12-2018T15:16:39,CrimsonQuill,How do YOU use Excel Tom?
10-12-2018T15:16:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I took a class on it
10-12-2018T15:16:40,Twokinds,"Excel can do a lot of neat, automated stuff, if you know how."
10-12-2018T15:16:44,Twokinds,"Unfortunately, I don't know how."
10-12-2018T15:16:45,Azumachan,In a day to day situation you don't need to know how to create complex self self fulfilling algorithmic tables
10-12-2018T15:16:51,CrimsonQuill,I have poor understanding how.
10-12-2018T15:17:03,Twokinds,I only use Excel these days to sort all the sketch requests
10-12-2018T15:17:21,CrimsonQuill,"And if I end up in Geographic Information Sciences stuff, logarithmic tables might BE the day to day stuff."
10-12-2018T15:17:24,Azumachan,"If you train your excel, it can predict your budget well"
10-12-2018T15:17:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Boring. But yeah it‚Äôs good knowing how to work it
10-12-2018T15:17:27,CrimsonQuill,I hope not to do that.
10-12-2018T15:17:38,Twokinds,And calculate my income sometimes.
10-12-2018T15:17:44,CrimsonQuill,I prefer to scribble stuff down on a sheet of paper and put it in a folder.
10-12-2018T15:17:54,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, at least you have the hang of it Tom."
10-12-2018T15:18:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I do my taxes on paper in front of me though so
10-12-2018T15:18:10,Twokinds,"I like being organized, but I don't have the patience for it."
10-12-2018T15:18:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Excel is for my vocabulary tables
10-12-2018T15:18:23,CrimsonQuill,"That makes two of us, Tom."
10-12-2018T15:18:36,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs what a secretary is for
10-12-2018T15:18:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Or assistant
10-12-2018T15:18:51,Twokinds,Alexa?
10-12-2018T15:19:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I dunno
10-12-2018T15:19:08,CrimsonQuill,I use Cortana.
10-12-2018T15:19:13,CrimsonQuill,Just to play music though.
10-12-2018T15:19:14,SpazztasticKiwi,She might be able to do taxes
10-12-2018T15:19:22,Azumachan,Mathlab is even coller
10-12-2018T15:19:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"How good she is, there‚Äôs no telling"
10-12-2018T15:19:29,CrimsonQuill,You use Matlab?
10-12-2018T15:19:47,Azumachan,unfortunately
10-12-2018T15:20:10,CrimsonQuill,"I've spent five months trying to learn it, and still have trouble."
10-12-2018T15:20:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Photomath is better. Don‚Äôt have to write anything if you can have it sole the problem with just a picture
10-12-2018T15:20:24,CrimsonQuill,Though part of it might have to be to do with my TV tropes addiction.
10-12-2018T15:21:01,CrimsonQuill,"We're using Matlab to identify stuff in pictures, and eventually, measure distances in pictures using map datum as a benchmark."
10-12-2018T15:25:34,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs sad they don‚Äôt teach the classes I got in high school as core
10-12-2018T15:25:42,SpazztasticKiwi,They‚Äôre electives
10-12-2018T15:26:39,Twokinds,"Yes, learning basic software, taxes, investing and interest should be mandatory."
10-12-2018T15:27:31,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, well I need to get to grips with a bit of budgeting..."
10-12-2018T15:27:42,Twokinds,Budgeting too
10-12-2018T15:27:47,CrimsonQuill,"I'm either very stingy, or splash far too much in one go."
10-12-2018T15:28:09,CrimsonQuill,I can often find good value stuff in shops for example...
10-12-2018T15:28:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"I also know 401(k)s, roths, budgets, stocks, credit card interests/payments budgets and balancing a checkbook"
10-12-2018T15:28:34,CrimsonQuill,I'm trying to get to grips with Excel and Matlab.
10-12-2018T15:29:03,SpazztasticKiwi,My bank agent likes me
10-12-2018T15:29:33,Twokinds,Yes I wish I knew 10 years ago what I know now
10-12-2018T15:29:46,Azumachan,Everybody does
10-12-2018T15:30:28,SpazztasticKiwi,10 years ago were well different
10-12-2018T15:30:50,SpazztasticKiwi,for me
10-12-2018T15:30:52,Twokinds,2008
10-12-2018T15:31:00,Twokinds,"Doesn't feel that long ago, but it really was a different time"
10-12-2018T15:31:04,Azumachan,First iphone
10-12-2018T15:31:21,Azumachan,or 2006
10-12-2018T15:31:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Least I would‚Äôve known not to leave for trick or treating that year
10-12-2018T15:32:04,CrimsonQuill,"I tend to not look back on the past...except some treasured memories. Most else though, unless It's definitely useful, I try to forget."
10-12-2018T15:34:08,Twokinds,Owow ow
10-12-2018T15:35:24,CrimsonQuill,Something stinging?
10-12-2018T15:35:37,Twokinds,Headache
10-12-2018T15:35:44,CrimsonQuill,"OOF, not nice."
10-12-2018T15:35:46,Twokinds,2nd day without coffee
10-12-2018T15:36:03,CrimsonQuill,Is your body just not used to not having coffee?
10-12-2018T15:36:07,Azumachan,try to order caffein pills
10-12-2018T15:36:12,CrimsonQuill,Or is it a random headache?
10-12-2018T15:36:18,Twokinds,Yeah I always get a headache after the 2nd day without it.
10-12-2018T15:36:29,Azumachan,or agave syrup for the coffee
10-12-2018T15:36:34,CrimsonQuill,Here's a tip-it should help: Have a hot shower.
10-12-2018T15:36:39,CrimsonQuill,Just a 5 minute rinse.
10-12-2018T15:36:56,CrimsonQuill,I should help relax you and reduce the pain.
10-12-2018T15:37:15,CrimsonQuill,"It works for me, though I tend to have to wait before I can do it..."
10-12-2018T15:39:41,Dadrobit,"I can do my own budgeting, but man, using an actual accountant to optimize my taxes quarterly is so worth it."
10-12-2018T15:42:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Tylenol?
10-12-2018T15:43:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I thought you said you were gonna go back to it today cause it was such a bother
10-12-2018T15:45:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh and I have another pin up idea
10-12-2018T15:46:11,Twokinds,Nah that was just me being frustrated
10-12-2018T15:46:23,Twokinds,I am going to use caffeine tablets
10-12-2018T15:46:35,Azumachan,be careful
10-12-2018T15:48:38,Azumachan,"Tom, it should be fixed now."
10-12-2018T15:49:16,Azumachan,I'm deeply sorry for the inconvenience.
10-12-2018T15:55:41,Twokinds,Oh it's no inconvenience!
10-12-2018T15:56:03,CrimsonQuill,Tea should help too.
10-12-2018T15:56:10,CrimsonQuill,Tea keeps the taile up!
10-12-2018T15:57:09,Twokinds,I'm sorry it was causing trouble
10-12-2018T15:57:23,Twokinds,"It worked! Wow, thanks so much. Seriously. That's really nice of you."
10-12-2018T15:58:08,CrimsonQuill,"What worked, Tom? What happened?"
10-12-2018T15:58:17,Azumachan,Magic
10-12-2018T15:58:34,CrimsonQuill,What sort of magic?
10-12-2018T15:58:41,CrimsonQuill,Normal or black?
10-12-2018T15:58:53,Azumachan,Dragon ?
10-12-2018T15:59:00,CrimsonQuill,"Seriously though, what's just happened? Agave nectar? Caffiene Pills? Shower?"
10-12-2018T15:59:22,Dadrobit,Video Game
10-12-2018T15:59:29,CrimsonQuill,Oh.
10-12-2018T15:59:32,CrimsonQuill,Okay
10-12-2018T16:00:07,LeShpeee,it's probably black basitin magic
10-12-2018T16:00:16,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:
10-12-2018T16:00:17,CrimsonQuill,Which doesn't exist.
10-12-2018T16:00:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Give him a code or something or did you just straight buy the game
10-12-2018T16:00:39,TerraTheWizard,"yeah, everyone knows it's blue magic :ctwokinds-smug:"
10-12-2018T16:00:58,TerraTheWizard,or was it green :ctwokinds-floraquestion:
10-12-2018T16:01:05,CrimsonQuill,"Madness Magic, because it turns them mad."
10-12-2018T16:02:06,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion: what colour is madness
10-12-2018T16:02:20,CrimsonQuill,"Octarine, the colour of magic."
10-12-2018T16:02:56,CrimsonQuill,"And if you want to know what Octarine is, then  (And here's Terry Pratchett again), It's in the Discworld Series."
10-12-2018T16:03:39,Xexanoth,blue magic is rather funny for dnd players....
10-12-2018T16:04:06,Xexanoth,"cause i'm prettty sure that was the ""sex"" magic"
10-12-2018T16:04:40,CrimsonQuill,Ummm....let's change the subject.
10-12-2018T16:05:16,Xexanoth,i mean it does involve stuff like Gender Change so Nora is a blue mage i guess
10-12-2018T16:05:30,Xexanoth,*saved it* :ptv-SteelwormHades:
10-12-2018T16:05:39,CrimsonQuill,"Nice catch, mate."
10-12-2018T16:05:53,CrimsonQuill,"Now, toss the grenade back over the wall before it goes off!"
10-12-2018T16:06:35,Azumachan,I think magic color goes with your alignment
10-12-2018T16:17:26,Twokinds,I've always liked blue
10-12-2018T16:18:35,Azumachan,Orange is neat
10-12-2018T16:19:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Green
10-12-2018T16:19:51,CrimsonQuill,Blue and Red are my favourite colours.
10-12-2018T16:20:08,CrimsonQuill,"So, I'd use Blue as Defensive and Red as offensive."
10-12-2018T16:23:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Green can be rather offensive
10-12-2018T16:23:52,CrimsonQuill,Please tell me this isn't a joke...
10-12-2018T16:24:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Thorns and poison aren‚Äôt kind in nato
10-12-2018T16:24:15,SpazztasticKiwi,nature
10-12-2018T16:24:22,CrimsonQuill,They aren't indeed...
10-12-2018T16:24:33,CrimsonQuill,I had thorns an inch long puncture my Wellington Boots.
10-12-2018T16:26:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm more of a nature spirit since it can go both ways
10-12-2018T16:26:55,SpazztasticKiwi,One of my top monster legends fighters too
10-12-2018T16:27:23,CrimsonQuill,I'm the most fond of plain old red and blue...
10-12-2018T16:27:41,Dadrobit,"If you play Blue in MtG, you're a monster, just sayin'."
10-12-2018T16:27:41,CrimsonQuill,"But of course, the neon or electric blue is to me the best."
10-12-2018T16:27:51,CrimsonQuill,The Blue that Trace has in his hair.
10-12-2018T16:28:01,CrimsonQuill,I associate it with high tech scifi stuff.
10-12-2018T16:28:13,CrimsonQuill,And a good shade of red can really complement it.
10-12-2018T16:29:01,Dadrobit,"""Counterspell, counterspell, return creature to target hand, counterspell, exile target creature....."" *pushes up glasses* ""It's a legitimate strategy!"""
10-12-2018T16:29:22,Dadrobit,Fuckin' blue players.
10-12-2018T16:29:45,CrimsonQuill,"Well, it is a legitimate strategy...used sparingly,"
10-12-2018T16:29:59,Dadrobit,It's like being beheaded by an executioner with terrible aim and a dull axe.
10-12-2018T16:30:12,CrimsonQuill,"I have only watched a few Red VS Blue episodes, but I am going to watch the whole series."
10-12-2018T16:30:18,CrimsonQuill,And well...
10-12-2018T16:30:25,CrimsonQuill,As for a terrible executioner...
10-12-2018T16:30:33,CrimsonQuill,Ever heard if Jack ketch?
10-12-2018T16:30:40,Dadrobit,"""Oh, you wanted to play the game? Sorry, I only play Mono-Blue decks."

10-12-2018T16:42:32,SpazztasticKiwi,So....
10-12-2018T16:42:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Know it alls
10-12-2018T16:42:55,CrimsonQuill,I like to think that I am NOT that person.
10-12-2018T16:44:39,Xexanoth,mono blue? i always prefered blue white for ultimate trolling.
10-12-2018T16:48:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Good ol powder blue
10-12-2018T17:03:03,Twokinds,I also like white green
10-12-2018T17:05:16,Foxpie,good old tokens
10-12-2018T17:09:45,CrimsonQuill,I'm off. Goodnight all!
10-12-2018T17:09:50,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-sleepy::ptv-victory:
10-12-2018T17:12:17,Azumachan,we should use the name used in warhammer paint

10-12-2018T17:14:33,Azumachan,"Man, those where fun times"

10-12-2018T18:57:10,Twokinds,Better now actually
10-12-2018T18:57:20,Twokinds,Just gotta work through the pain
10-12-2018T19:04:58,Twokinds,I can't believe how much sugar there is in everything
10-12-2018T19:05:06,SpazztasticKiwi,*claps loudly*
10-12-2018T19:05:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Welcome to America
10-12-2018T19:05:41,Twokinds,I must have been consuming 3x the recommended amount daily
10-12-2018T19:05:45,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs either deep fried or drowned in sugar
10-12-2018T19:06:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"And if it‚Äôs a funnel cake, it‚Äôs both"
10-12-2018T19:06:25,SpazztasticKiwi,How much sugar do you put in your coffee?!
10-12-2018T19:07:13,Bgrmystr2,lol.. probably just as much as everyone else.
10-12-2018T19:07:15,Twokinds,Uh... I get that coffee creamer that already sweetened
10-12-2018T19:07:38,SpazztasticKiwi,And what - dump it in?
10-12-2018T19:07:43,Twokinds,It's like liquid sugar
10-12-2018T19:07:56,Twokinds,"And yeah, my coffee is like... 1/5 that creamer"
10-12-2018T19:08:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Tell me if you start shaking from withdrawal cause I‚Äôm not entirely sure that‚Äôs just sugar
10-12-2018T19:08:48,Twokinds,I have a very bad sweet tooth! I can't help it!
10-12-2018T19:08:59,Twokinds,I wasn't lying in that video that I really do like all kinds of sweets.
10-12-2018T19:09:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Well at least someone liked them
10-12-2018T19:09:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Those fruity chew things are what I wanted to try
10-12-2018T19:10:00,Bgrmystr2,"My dad went through severe caffine withdrawals when I was a kid, like really really fucking bad, so beware that."
10-12-2018T19:10:04,Bgrmystr2,cuz it may not just be the sugar.
10-12-2018T19:10:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah. Keep in mind caffeine is still a drug
10-12-2018T19:10:42,Bgrmystr2,and it's just as addicting as some of the drugs banned
10-12-2018T19:10:45,Bgrmystr2,"cocanie, etc"
10-12-2018T19:13:49,SpazztasticKiwi,You think you could go two weeks without added sugar?
10-12-2018T19:14:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause that‚Äôs how long it takes to break the habit. Also be about the time all of it should be out of you
10-12-2018T19:14:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Might make for an aggravated Christmas though
10-12-2018T19:16:35,Twokinds,I'm sure I'll be fine
10-12-2018T19:20:13,Twokinds,I've quit drinking coffee forever several times.
10-12-2018T19:20:47,Bgrmystr2,not a very long forever huh..
10-12-2018T19:20:59,Bgrmystr2,I guess you really have been living for way longer than any of us.. xD
10-12-2018T19:25:41,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúQuitting isn‚Äôt hard. I‚Äôve done it five times!‚Äù

10-12-2018T19:29:00,Bgrmystr2,dessert is fine
10-12-2018T19:29:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Gonna be at the table like ü§§
10-12-2018T19:29:24,Bgrmystr2,"with all the sugar taken away from coffee, he can still eat the same sugar from dessert."
10-12-2018T19:29:31,Bgrmystr2,no big deal :v
10-12-2018T19:30:45,SpazztasticKiwi,By the way - I went to the dentist
10-12-2018T19:31:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve managed to cut my gums

10-12-2018T19:34:17,SpazztasticKiwi,But I also taught Bagheera a new trick
10-12-2018T19:40:04,MrMongMong,Is it to Praise the Sun?
10-12-2018T19:45:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Nah. He gets in the crate on his own
10-12-2018T19:53:14,tehbear,"there are, or there used to be toothbrushes that would ""click"" backwards to indicate brushing too hard"
10-12-2018T21:08:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera is laying on me and smushing his fluff against my face
