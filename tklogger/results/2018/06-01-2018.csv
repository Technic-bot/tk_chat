06-01-2018T00:17:17,TheBeckoner,I tore the frenulum under my tongue :disappointed:
06-01-2018T01:59:13,GreninjaGaming,pingas
06-01-2018T02:26:41,ZizzoGaming,Hey all! I'm back from game night with my friends.
06-01-2018T02:27:25,ZizzoGaming,"Played ""Who's Most Likely To..."" and Monopoly City"
06-01-2018T02:48:32,KuroganeWatanoshi,I am starting to get a bit creeped out
06-01-2018T02:51:09,ZizzoGaming,Why
06-01-2018T02:54:05,KuroganeWatanoshi,there is this person on twitter.. @BrianAwe19 who keeps asking where my location is
06-01-2018T02:54:19,KuroganeWatanoshi,and says that I know him from this stream
06-01-2018T02:54:46,KuroganeWatanoshi,"but when I ask him what his name was in the stream he said, ""I have no name...."""
06-01-2018T02:55:31,MidnightBlue78,that is a bit weird
06-01-2018T02:55:40,KuroganeWatanoshi,and overall he has me creeped out. I don't want to block them because I don't want to be rude but he won't take my advise to dm
06-01-2018T02:55:42,MidnightBlue78,just block the person
06-01-2018T02:55:55,KuroganeWatanoshi,It's just really really starting to make me a little scared
06-01-2018T02:56:12,KuroganeWatanoshi,what should I do?
06-01-2018T02:56:18,KuroganeWatanoshi,oh nvm
06-01-2018T02:56:25,KuroganeWatanoshi,I just read what you said
06-01-2018T02:56:26,MidnightBlue78,"Well, if you're not comfortable about it, block them"
06-01-2018T02:56:51,MidnightBlue78,you don't need to explain anything to them
06-01-2018T02:56:51,KuroganeWatanoshi,Alright.
06-01-2018T02:57:00,KuroganeWatanoshi,Thanks
06-01-2018T02:57:05,MidnightBlue78,"I mean, that's what I would do"
06-01-2018T02:57:35,MidnightBlue78,"To be totally honest, I have no clue who it could be"
06-01-2018T02:58:50,KuroganeWatanoshi,"They saw what my ""Location"" was and since then I changed it so no one can see it. but they keep asking if I am from this state called Iowa... I am not"
06-01-2018T02:59:18,KuroganeWatanoshi,I'll block them
06-01-2018T03:51:57,ZizzoGaming,Goodnight all! See you guys tomorrow!
06-01-2018T03:56:59,ZizzoGaming,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
06-01-2018T03:57:11,ZizzoGaming,^ I forgot to add that
06-01-2018T07:34:59,Bgrmystr2,"See, that's the very reason we have the block feature, Kuro"
06-01-2018T07:35:15,Bgrmystr2,because that's not normal for someone to just up an ask that.

06-01-2018T15:51:14,TorqueEmUp,only thing that sucks about it is the 2GB of RAM.
06-01-2018T15:51:26,Kinipshun,just download more
06-01-2018T15:51:42,TorqueEmUp,"But this is just a cheap, small light laptop I can throw around without worrying because it's so cheap."
06-01-2018T15:51:51,TorqueEmUp,hell a replacement screen is only $25 for it. lol
06-01-2018T15:52:02,Kinipshun,what's it's resolution?

06-01-2018T15:52:51,Kinipshun,its probably good for documents/spreadsheets im sure
06-01-2018T15:52:58,TorqueEmUp,"It's something for me to use at work so I am not bored to death, and won't be out a huge amount if something gets busted."
06-01-2018T15:53:27,TorqueEmUp,better than use a god damned phone

06-01-2018T16:13:51,Glassan,It could also be odd interaction with some addon. I had that problem from time to time w/ firefox.
06-01-2018T16:13:52,TerraTheWizard,sure you don't have an extension messing with it?
06-01-2018T16:13:59,Bgrmystr2,Yes Terra
06-01-2018T16:14:05,Bgrmystr2,Because that extension would mess with all sites
06-01-2018T16:14:08,thestooge,"I might have to see that, Marv"
06-01-2018T16:14:10,Bgrmystr2,not just one specific one randomly

06-01-2018T16:14:51,Glassan,"Heck, I recently discovered one site that would crash my browser when loading a .webm video and it turned out to be the theme I was using."
06-01-2018T16:14:56,Bgrmystr2,Extensions don't work like that. They won't affect just one site randomly and not affect any other site ever.
06-01-2018T16:14:57,TerraTheWizard,brbrbrbr restarting mah interwebs
06-01-2018T16:15:17,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah for some reason I couldn't connect to the tkpolls in chromeos, had to switch over to linux and use firefox."

06-01-2018T16:45:58,Twokinds,It's a common name just look up the pronounciation
06-01-2018T16:46:00,Mustanglvr007,shiternet has struck me again
06-01-2018T16:46:00,Bgrmystr2,"but for him to have teleport, he wouldn't have been there ON the ship to watch trace :P"
06-01-2018T16:46:03,SomeOtherTom,This needs Andy Serkis in a mocap suit as Nibbley
06-01-2018T16:46:05,thestooge,ok thanks
06-01-2018T16:46:06,Twokinds,It's Mayv
06-01-2018T16:46:07,Glassan,"If he could teleport after all the magic was drained, that would be a feat."
06-01-2018T16:46:07,WereKeidran,@mcclaw i think that's Euchre

06-01-2018T16:46:28,MidnightBlue78,Mayv
06-01-2018T16:46:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Ossem and Other Tom
06-01-2018T16:46:31,ThingsAreMoving,Maiev ?

06-01-2018T16:46:37,unsteddyphoenix,heyo
06-01-2018T16:46:39,Glassan,That's how I always pronounced it as well.
06-01-2018T16:46:41,Wyvern088,does this mean Nora is CGI?
06-01-2018T16:46:41,DarthKeidran,Maybe Edmund has an elytra.
06-01-2018T16:46:44,Bgrmystr2,"there's no i, things"
06-01-2018T16:46:47,TheBeckoner,Hello Other and Ossem
06-01-2018T16:46:54,ThingsAreMoving,Maiev was from Warcraft
06-01-2018T16:46:55,Glassan,"I think I first ever heard the name Maeve from the Dresden Files, honestly."
06-01-2018T16:46:59,thestooge,BRB going to get dinner
06-01-2018T16:47:00,Dimensional,Heh. Nora isn't CG.
06-01-2018T16:47:04,Dimensional,She's real.
06-01-2018T16:47:07,Ordithus,"Nora is really a gecko, they just use perspective tricks"
06-01-2018T16:47:12,Mustanglvr007,i always thought her name was pronounced mayeeve
06-01-2018T16:47:12,Beardedskynet,It  could be a script about  a certain fan written book of 'ships'.
06-01-2018T16:47:12,Bgrmystr2,xDD Ord
06-01-2018T16:47:13,Dimensional,They use a green screen.

06-01-2018T16:47:18,TheBeckoner,Of course shes real
06-01-2018T16:47:29,avaragejo,it's all practical effects.
06-01-2018T16:47:34,Combak,Warcraft? You mean that Hearthstone spin-off?
06-01-2018T16:47:39,ThingsAreMoving,yup
06-01-2018T16:47:43,Ossem1,Maybe noras a wyvern. I dont know the difference
06-01-2018T16:48:01,Wyvern088,touche
06-01-2018T16:48:06,FenceEqualizer,Wyvern has only legs.
06-01-2018T16:48:06,Combak,Nora is a dragon. Wyverns normally have a bat-like set-up.
06-01-2018T16:48:10,Glassan,Ha ha. Shots fired.
06-01-2018T16:48:16,Mustanglvr007,Nora is a dragon

06-01-2018T17:13:11,DarthKeidran,Tom should just draw a big fluff sphere as a “Bonus” attachment.
06-01-2018T17:13:18,Kinipshun,rest in pepperoni
06-01-2018T17:13:25,TorqueEmUp,ughh I guess a 5mbps mobil connection is too slow for the stream

06-01-2018T17:15:13,CrRAR,Natani's upset with his agility reduction. :(
06-01-2018T17:15:26,CrRAR,Needs the speeds for the stabs.
06-01-2018T17:15:35,Mustanglvr007,"Tom, is Natani a he or she??"

06-01-2018T17:15:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Natani is a sayin
06-01-2018T17:15:49,Kinipshun,totally  a she
06-01-2018T17:15:51,NeonMitsumi,Leave that to Reddit
06-01-2018T17:15:56,CrRAR,That... would take a thesis to elaborate.
06-01-2018T17:15:59,DarthKeidran,If Natani starts bouncing to the music there is going to be some additional uncomfortable motions.
06-01-2018T17:16:01,Mustanglvr007,I'd consider Natani a she
06-01-2018T17:16:05,CrRAR,indeed Neon XD
06-01-2018T17:16:21,MomijiTheBraixen,MAXIMUM FLUFF

06-01-2018T17:16:30,NeonMitsumi,"They already argued about it, like damn"
06-01-2018T17:16:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Now I want to see Natani Rage break like tfs Vegeta
06-01-2018T17:16:32,TorqueEmUp,I'm the same Mustang
06-01-2018T17:16:39,Kinipshun,"@Mustanglvr007 physically, nat is a she, but mentally its a he"
06-01-2018T17:16:40,WereKeidran,"Natani has a female body but has always identified as a male, however in recent points of the comicNatani ahs been coming to terms with their feminimity"
06-01-2018T17:16:47,CrimsonHelsing,Too late! ALREADY LAUGHING xD
06-01-2018T17:16:54,ThingsAreMoving,Nat's floof gives +5 to choking assasination
06-01-2018T17:16:59,Bgrmystr2,"Kinip, it's not that simple"
06-01-2018T17:17:05,TheBeckoner,Natani is considered male http://twokinds.keenspot.com/characters/
06-01-2018T17:17:08,TorqueEmUp,agree with bgr here
06-01-2018T17:17:10,Glassan,"Huh, I thought the identification happened more after the soul merge."
06-01-2018T17:17:11,MviluUatusun,Why do I think that's Keith she's talking to.  LOL.
06-01-2018T17:17:12,TorqueEmUp,Nat is complicated
06-01-2018T17:17:13,Bgrmystr2,but I guess people don't read the comic :v
06-01-2018T17:17:17,Glassan,"Still, Nat considers himself male."
06-01-2018T17:17:18,DevlNuK,xd
06-01-2018T17:17:19,Bgrmystr2,cuz it's literally explained there
06-01-2018T17:17:19,CrRAR,I like that argument mustang because Natani's orig gender was essentially stolen from him... he likes being called a he now because that what makes him feel comfortable tho.
06-01-2018T17:17:20,Mustanglvr007,"Hey, I thought everyone was gonna put the bouncy Flora emotes when we started bouncing!"
06-01-2018T17:17:20,BadFoMo,...She has a killer eletro shock attack now though.
06-01-2018T17:17:22,ThingsAreMoving,Can we not have Nat's gender discussion AGAIN

06-01-2018T19:05:53,Pineapplekat,traps arent gay
06-01-2018T19:05:55,CrRAR,lol
06-01-2018T19:05:56,PalmettoPathfinder1,Nope.  Humans were at war with dragons and then the planet caught two extra moons and that caused a major upheaval to the planet and the dragons decided to take over and kicked the humans to curb.  Although some dragons want to protect us and train and
06-01-2018T19:06:01,PalmettoPathfinder1,Study us.
06-01-2018T19:06:04,CrRAR,Yeah that duck has some 'splanin to do!

06-01-2018T19:07:40,Xexanoth,as punishment for being an ass

06-01-2018T19:07:47,CrRAR,Duck wants promotion~
06-01-2018T19:07:49,BadFoMo,@MrEase The what?
06-01-2018T19:07:55,goldgardian,I suggested this because
06-01-2018T19:07:57,PalmettoPathfinder1,Also @thingsaremoving I'm talking about the Wings of Fire series by Tui Sutherland.
06-01-2018T19:08:02,Twilight,so it is canon then.
06-01-2018T19:08:05,goldgardian,1. I like seeing clovis squirm
06-01-2018T19:08:15,goldgardian,2. I thought It might be a funny what if
06-01-2018T19:08:19,TheBeckoner,Everything is canon.
06-01-2018T19:08:20,CrRAR,good one gold!
06-01-2018T19:08:24,MrEase,@BadFoMo I drew this sketch 2 and a half months ago as a trash request

06-01-2018T19:09:22,ThingsAreMoving,Imho the best series featuring dragons are still Dragons of PERN by Anne McAffrey
06-01-2018T19:09:27,unsteddyphoenix,It may have been intended as more fanservicey than it ended up
06-01-2018T19:09:33,CrRAR,lol
06-01-2018T19:09:36,MrEase,are links to SFW pics allowed in the chat?

06-01-2018T21:11:50,Combak,#6.
06-01-2018T21:11:59,Aleris,something including humanoid nora
06-01-2018T21:12:00,MarshallMelon,Unless I counted wrong
06-01-2018T21:12:01,Bgrmystr2,the last image vote said #6 as well.
06-01-2018T21:12:07,Mustanglvr007,"ILL HAVE 2 NUMBER 9S, A NUMBER 9 LARGE, A NUMBER 6 WITH EXTRA DIP, A NUMBER 7, TWO NUMBER 45S, ONE WITH CHEESE, AND A LARGE SODA"

06-01-2018T21:12:10,Combak,Seems to be something involving human Nora. :shrug:
06-01-2018T21:12:18,Delta255,Maybe
06-01-2018T21:12:20,SableArts,Nora seducing Trace while Flora is ignored.
06-01-2018T21:12:32,CrRAR,"I just want a Royale w/ cheese, thanks."
06-01-2018T21:12:33,MarshallMelon,I didn't see Sketch 5. Which was that again?
06-01-2018T21:12:36,BadFoMo,@Combak I half Trolled and requested Natani rolling Blueberry Inflated Keith.
06-01-2018T21:12:46,Combak,... Wat
06-01-2018T21:12:50,Combak,Okay then.
06-01-2018T21:12:53,Xexanoth,Natani's second set of enchanted chest bindings used as a blindfold
06-01-2018T21:12:56,CrRAR,you'll see at the end probably showering Flora?
06-01-2018T21:12:59,Xexanoth,@Marshal
06-01-2018T21:13:04,Combak,"I mean, I get the reference, but... Why?"
06-01-2018T21:13:12,MarshallMelon,"Hmm, then it might be #6 then"
06-01-2018T21:13:27,CrRAR,did you see blindfolded Keith?
06-01-2018T21:13:28,Delta255,Wait
06-01-2018T21:13:40,Delta255,It says Sketch 6 on the bottom
06-01-2018T21:13:45,Bgrmystr2,"Off-set cast, Bath w/ Clovis, Flora Shower, and Keithface mc boobwraps. That's 5"
06-01-2018T21:13:46,Combak,Yes.
06-01-2018T21:13:55,LeKnightWolf,@SableArts i believe that what you typed is actually having.
06-01-2018T21:14:00,Bgrmystr2,fuzzy Natani*
06-01-2018T21:14:01,Bgrmystr2,as well
06-01-2018T21:14:02,Delta255,So according to logic this should be Sketch 6.
06-01-2018T21:14:04,Combak,Keithface McBoobwraps. XD
06-01-2018T21:14:07,Aleris,ya

06-01-2018T21:14:09,Bgrmystr2,"that's 5, so this one should be 6"
06-01-2018T21:14:17,Bgrmystr2,haha combak yes
06-01-2018T21:14:21,Bgrmystr2,that's what I went with

06-01-2018T21:14:44,Combak,We can tell Melon.
06-01-2018T21:14:45,Aleris,numbers are for the mortal

06-01-2018T21:15:19,Bgrmystr2,the previous image vote said #6 as well tom
06-01-2018T21:15:21,TheDixieNutjob,"eh, math never bugged me until I got into geometry and calculus"
06-01-2018T21:15:30,MarshallMelon,Well maybe i'm illiterate. Don't judge my disabilities sir

06-01-2018T21:15:38,Delta255,HERETICS
06-01-2018T21:15:38,unsteddyphoenix,Plus he started with a vote and this wasnt a vote...
06-01-2018T21:15:40,MidnightBlue78,Because you don't change the numbers accordingly
06-01-2018T21:15:42,unsteddyphoenix,You can just count it's not hard.
06-01-2018T21:15:44,TheDixieNutjob,I was once good at Algebra
06-01-2018T21:15:48,SableArts,"Yeah, but before the vote for 6 was A and B."

06-01-2018T21:43:21,TheDixieNutjob,so I had a dragon character idea for a fantasy comic and one idea I had was that alcohol was like poison to them so she has to drink water. Not sure what would substitute as the idea is in its infancy

06-01-2018T22:44:49,unsteddyphoenix,The sketches?
06-01-2018T22:44:52,Kinipshun,yeah
06-01-2018T22:45:21,unsteddyphoenix,Dont really see how that's relevant
06-01-2018T22:45:37,Ordithus,Let's take Dadrobit's purgatory as an example.
06-01-2018T22:45:48,Kinipshun,it;s relevant because it wouldnt be much of a change if he DID draw that
06-01-2018T22:46:08,Kinipshun,meaning change from the norm
06-01-2018T22:46:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I would like a story when it comes to sad stuff like that
06-01-2018T22:46:13,Ordithus,"Dadrobit's purgatory being the sketch of him and an older Maddie, clearly married."
06-01-2018T22:46:26,Kinipshun,"i can agree there, marv"
06-01-2018T22:46:37,CrRAR,Maybe Keith just slept too long and Natani THOUGHT he was dead.
06-01-2018T22:46:44,Kinipshun,lol
06-01-2018T22:46:52,CrRAR,...or confused Keith daki for real Keith
06-01-2018T22:46:55,unsteddyphoenix,"Exactly, Dads one had a premise and some context."
06-01-2018T22:46:56,Ordithus,"Natani has passed on, him and Keith had their time.  Keith, as a widower, moves on and finds love with Maddie."
06-01-2018T22:46:58,Kinipshun,he was just somehow anaesthetized
06-01-2018T22:47:10,CrRAR,^
06-01-2018T22:47:21,Kinipshun,STRONGLY ANAESTHETIZED
06-01-2018T22:47:29,CrRAR,WE MUST GO DEEPER
06-01-2018T22:47:33,Kinipshun,(cuz hes a basitin)
06-01-2018T22:47:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,sad stuff that just starts off sad does not really have any impact
06-01-2018T22:47:43,CrRAR,tru
06-01-2018T22:47:46,Kinipshun,thats true i guess
06-01-2018T22:47:53,CrRAR,Just sad for everyone all around
06-01-2018T22:48:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Its the build up that makes you go "" NOOOO!!!!!!!!!"""
06-01-2018T22:48:17,Kinipshun,ye
06-01-2018T22:48:51,unsteddyphoenix,"Right, so just ""ded keef"" isnt very interesting to most of us."
06-01-2018T22:49:07,Ordithus,"Honestly, I thought it was a troll when I saw it."
06-01-2018T22:49:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"its ""ok he dead now"""
06-01-2018T22:49:28,Ordithus,And I don't pay no tolls to no trolls.
06-01-2018T22:49:31,unsteddyphoenix,Didnt seem like a very serious suggestion lol.
06-01-2018T22:49:38,unsteddyphoenix,Surprised it got through
06-01-2018T22:49:40,Kinipshun,"then again, so was natani in the keith's romantic dinner with maddie"
06-01-2018T22:50:00,Ordithus,"Yeah, it took Dadrobit a while to win people over."
06-01-2018T22:50:11,Kinipshun,lol yea that took forever
06-01-2018T22:50:17,unsteddyphoenix,Tom really didnt like it at first either.
06-01-2018T22:50:22,Ordithus,No he did not.
06-01-2018T22:50:28,Kinipshun,i loved the idea lol
06-01-2018T22:50:30,CrRAR,yeah I could see why
06-01-2018T22:50:41,unsteddyphoenix,Sad ones definitely need to meet a higher standard than naked shower cats
06-01-2018T22:50:41,Kinipshun,i guess im just a huge sap
06-01-2018T22:50:44,CrRAR,Natani does need need a broken heart
06-01-2018T22:50:45,Ordithus,lol
06-01-2018T22:50:48,CrRAR,&lt;/4
06-01-2018T22:50:53,CrRAR,&lt;/3
06-01-2018T22:51:02,unsteddyphoenix,"I liked it too, it was kind of morbidly funny."
06-01-2018T22:51:10,CrRAR,also need = not
06-01-2018T22:51:24,CrRAR,yeah
06-01-2018T22:52:03,Ordithus,"Lots of tragedy in TK, though.  Mostly in the history."
06-01-2018T22:52:12,CrRAR,mmm
06-01-2018T22:52:23,Kinipshun,laura will be missed for sure
06-01-2018T22:52:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:urn:
06-01-2018T22:52:32,Ordithus,How many people died in the Taverndatter's town?
06-01-2018T22:53:35,Kinipshun,what was that town called again?
06-01-2018T22:53:42,Ordithus,Was that Wreathwood?
06-01-2018T22:53:50,Kinipshun,might've been
06-01-2018T22:54:32,Kinipshun,yeah wreathwood
06-01-2018T22:54:58,Ordithus,https://orig00.deviantart.net/6a1b/f/2012/107/a/e/twokinds_world_map_by_twokinds-d4wjhd0.jpg
06-01-2018T22:55:52,Ordithus,MIght have been Pinewood
06-01-2018T22:57:52,Ordithus,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/857/
06-01-2018T22:58:11,Ordithus,"Wreathwood Razed!  Aslo, that Call to Action has Trace's signature.  Intriguing."
06-01-2018T22:59:39,CrRAR,"The symbol is a general templar symbol I think, does it say Trace Legacy?"
06-01-2018T23:00:02,CrRAR,oh yeah it actually kinda does
06-01-2018T23:00:15,Bgrmystr2,It was probably back before trace lost his memory
06-01-2018T23:00:22,Bgrmystr2,that he signed it
06-01-2018T23:00:37,Bgrmystr2,ignoring the fact that it could have been forged
06-01-2018T23:00:42,Bgrmystr2,either one
06-01-2018T23:00:58,unsteddyphoenix,Forgery would be easy for them
06-01-2018T23:01:10,CrRAR,"I mean the state of things is that with the vacuum of power some are pretending he's still alive, some are trying to get him back, some want him to stay away, some wnat him dead."
06-01-2018T23:01:16,CrRAR,yeah unsteddy lol
06-01-2018T23:02:26,CrRAR,"Not ""still alive"" but like not having disappeared or whatever."
06-01-2018T23:03:17,Ordithus,"Most people must not know that Trace has been ""missing' for a few months"
06-01-2018T23:03:46,Ordithus,Otherwise they wouldn't bother with forging his signature.
06-01-2018T23:03:54,CrRAR,Yeah society in 2Kinds-land is a pretty big mess. lol
06-01-2018T23:04:02,Ordithus,Yep
06-01-2018T23:05:33,unsteddyphoenix,Peasents probably dont pay attention to that kind of thing
06-01-2018T23:05:44,Ordithus,True
06-01-2018T23:05:45,unsteddyphoenix,easy to bamboozle~
06-01-2018T23:05:51,CrRAR,silly peasents
06-01-2018T23:06:10,CrRAR,keep farming the wheat!
06-01-2018T23:06:13,Ordithus,More interested in putting food on the table and clothes on their backs than the goings on of their superiors
06-01-2018T23:06:18,CrRAR,Nothing to see here!
06-01-2018T23:06:24,CrRAR,haha

06-01-2018T23:09:39,Ordithus,A network of pigeons

06-01-2018T23:09:48,TheBeckoner,What world are we in?
06-01-2018T23:09:49,unsteddyphoenix,The internets pretty good they should invest in it.

06-01-2018T23:14:33,TheBeckoner,Sounds good to me unless Tom confirms the canon has different internet
06-01-2018T23:14:45,TheBeckoner,&gt;everything is canon
