10-11-2018T16:14:04,SIROUS25,Draw whatever you want
10-11-2018T16:14:13,ProsePro7,I think Nat would lock herself in the bathroom and check out her new body
10-11-2018T16:14:19,Combak,"Probably them reacting to each other or people reacting to the ""costume"""
10-11-2018T16:14:23,KiTA,I think Nat and Keith would immediately go spar
10-11-2018T16:14:27,ProsePro7,Judging by the way she was looking down Keiths pants
10-11-2018T16:14:35,TerraTheWizard,"arg, lost connection there"
10-11-2018T16:14:36,Combak,"Or more fully to the changes, I guess."

10-11-2018T16:18:46,Combak,The suggestion to start with the Artist's Choice is probably a good one.
10-11-2018T16:18:47,ThingsAreMoving,It's plausible
10-11-2018T16:18:51,ProsePro7,No youre not

10-11-2018T16:28:24,KiTA,probably getting a ddos again
10-11-2018T16:29:09,Beardedskynet,I hope not. DDOs have been messing with FFXIV too much lately. Does everyone have to poke all over the internet? D:
10-11-2018T16:29:34,Mandag,"Man, I wonder how Trace's evil Grand Templar side works into this bodyswap."
10-11-2018T16:29:40,Twokinds,Dunno why there's always people out there who's gotta break things

10-11-2018T16:31:20,Bgrmystr2,not likely Prose

10-11-2018T16:32:25,Twokinds,Haven't found good enough synth sax music
10-11-2018T16:32:34,Bgrmystr2,:u
10-11-2018T16:32:37,CrimsonQuill,You could look for a remix of take 5
10-11-2018T16:32:39,Beardedskynet,"Oh, that's a good idea."
10-11-2018T16:32:41,Twokinds,Gotta have sax but also be catchy and fast
10-11-2018T16:32:47,CrimsonQuill,Yep. take 5
10-11-2018T16:32:55,Beardedskynet,Picture of squirrel with sax

10-11-2018T16:32:58,NeonMitsumi,Hmmmmmmm
10-11-2018T16:33:00,ThingsAreMoving,"Well that means you are looking, so all we need to do is to be patient"

10-11-2018T16:33:13,Bgrmystr2,fairly common imo
10-11-2018T16:33:13,CrimsonQuill,It'd make fast and catchy tune
10-11-2018T16:33:22,ThingsAreMoving,"Beardedskynet, he's drawn that already"
10-11-2018T16:33:25,Twokinds,I demand my music be bouncy
10-11-2018T16:33:30,Bgrmystr2,xD
10-11-2018T16:33:31,qwe304,"the fact that the ""currently playing"" thing broke makes keeping an up to date playlist a whole lot harder"
10-11-2018T16:33:33,ThingsAreMoving,There was even an emote of Nibbs playing sax
10-11-2018T16:33:35,Bgrmystr2,how do you ever get any work done tom?
10-11-2018T16:33:35,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, it's very bouncy Tom."
10-11-2018T16:33:36,Tharkis,fast + sax in a non pure jazz type way i mean bgr
10-11-2018T16:33:42,CrimsonQuill,"Seriously, super cool."
10-11-2018T16:33:45,Beardedskynet,Then there needs to be another one drawn.
10-11-2018T16:33:51,ThingsAreMoving,I concur
10-11-2018T16:33:51,Tharkis,i mean plenty of fast saxaphone but not in peppy upbeat music =D
10-11-2018T16:33:57,CrimsonQuill,You could make a bouncy castle with Dave Brubeck.
10-11-2018T16:34:00,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah I've heard that too, Tharkis"
10-11-2018T16:34:35,RimaDraws,the stream keeps cutting out for me...this is lame

10-11-2018T17:01:41,TerraTheWizard,can't whack a server you can't see
10-11-2018T17:01:53,CrimsonQuill,"Literally. One time my headphones went wonky, and in a fit of despair, I hit them with my hand. AND IT FIXED THEM."
10-11-2018T17:01:55,DarthKeidran,What Tom aught to do is have Flora (Trace‚Äôs body) only in boxers and discussing thinking of going ‚ÄúAu Natural‚Äù
10-11-2018T17:02:02,Beardedskynet,It would take a while but you could find that server.
10-11-2018T17:02:03,Bgrmystr2,"that's not a great idea, though, Quill"
10-11-2018T17:02:04,Mandag,"Man, Keith really should be more careful with the booze when he's in that form. Damn keidran alcohol (in)tolerance"
10-11-2018T17:02:08,ProsePro7,"Arise chicken, chicken arise!"
10-11-2018T17:02:10,CrimsonQuill,I know.

10-11-2018T17:02:32,CrimsonQuill,I know. KLike to my big toe
10-11-2018T17:02:38,CommanderTrace,sorry
10-11-2018T17:02:45,ProsePro7,Cocoa or tea?
10-11-2018T17:02:47,Beardedskynet,"Hello, this is Pollo Diablo IT, how may we bawk! help you today?"
10-11-2018T17:02:52,CrimsonQuill,"Note guys-when fencing, DO NOT kick a fence post if it's not cooperating."

10-11-2018T17:03:23,ThingsAreMoving,"When boxing, put gifts insode the box first"
10-11-2018T17:03:27,CrimsonQuill,Fezzes are cool.
10-11-2018T17:03:27,ThingsAreMoving,inside*
10-11-2018T17:03:29,Bgrmystr2,well duh Quill
10-11-2018T17:03:47,ProsePro7,The hell is going on in this sketch
10-11-2018T17:03:52,Mandag,<HAHA HEY GUYS I'M KEITH WOOO I HAVE A DICK> -Natani
10-11-2018T17:03:54,RimaDraws,what is keith doing with the lampshade
10-11-2018T17:03:55,Channelfiction,Oh Zen see's Nat in another body
10-11-2018T17:03:59,ShadowSoap,"I have no idea, but I like it"
10-11-2018T17:04:05,CrimsonQuill,@Bgrmystr2 I lose my head when I'm mad. Ever hurled curses at a tree?
10-11-2018T17:04:13,Beardedskynet,Keith's assuming he's a lamp now.
10-11-2018T17:04:18,CrimsonQuill,FEZZES!
10-11-2018T17:04:19,RimaDraws,i think he does
10-11-2018T17:05:06,ThingsAreMoving,"Is that Zen, screaming at Nat/keith?"
10-11-2018T17:05:08,Gfawkes77,and Life of the party time Natani
10-11-2018T17:05:20,RimaDraws,i think so things
10-11-2018T17:05:22,DarthKeidran,"@CrimsonQuill no, can‚Äôt say I have, but they say words are sharper than a sword, so hopefully you accomplish your quest in chopping down a tree. x‚ÄôD¬≥"
10-11-2018T17:05:26,Mandag,Something tells me Keith (actually Natani) may be a little drunk
10-11-2018T17:05:35,ThingsAreMoving,So many characters
10-11-2018T17:05:46,Beardedskynet,there it is. It's keith getting mad at kieth
10-11-2018T17:05:52,Channelfiction,Ohh it's the mental link
10-11-2018T17:06:14,Channelfiction,"""Oh so this is what it's like in Natani's head, Zen nice to meet you"""
10-11-2018T17:06:19,ThingsAreMoving,whoah
10-11-2018T17:06:21,ThingsAreMoving,the speed
10-11-2018T17:06:22,DarthKeidran,Question. What‚Äôs Youngtani thinking of this madness.
10-11-2018T17:06:25,Cmndrwolf,wonder if trace can feel da baby.
10-11-2018T17:06:33,ThingsAreMoving,Tom shifted to 5th gear
10-11-2018T17:06:38,Cmndrwolf,out of curiosity.
10-11-2018T17:06:39,Beardedskynet,I'm sure Trace feels the baby.
10-11-2018T17:06:44,Mandag,YoungTani is probably having the time of her life.
10-11-2018T17:06:59,ThingsAreMoving,Is youngtani a living thing? :ctwokinds-floraquestion:
10-11-2018T17:07:05,Beardedskynet,"Yes, no."
10-11-2018T17:07:12,unsteddyphoenix,hope tom can survive colouring this
10-11-2018T17:07:16,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
10-11-2018T17:07:19,Bgrmystr2,"Seems like the normal thing to do, @CrimsonQuill. I'm not seeing anything out of the ordinary."
10-11-2018T17:07:22,Beardedskynet,youngtani is a fragment of Nat's younger self.
10-11-2018T17:07:23,ThingsAreMoving,"i thought the same thing, unfteddy"
10-11-2018T17:07:37,Bgrmystr2,I yell at inanimate objects all the time. At least trees are living.
10-11-2018T17:07:37,Beardedskynet,Or just a fragment of Nat
10-11-2018T17:07:41,ThingsAreMoving,I can bet on this winning in the color vote just cause lots of characters
10-11-2018T17:08:00,Channelfiction,Oh geez what if Nat is streaking
10-11-2018T17:08:10,unsteddyphoenix,harder it is to draw = higher chance of winning
10-11-2018T17:08:18,Mandag,Didn't Nat use to have a strand of gray hair?
10-11-2018T17:08:19,unsteddyphoenix,'cause...we're evil i guess~
10-11-2018T17:08:28,CatzArt,those look like bastin ears to me
10-11-2018T17:08:29,DarthKeidran,"@ThingsArMoving more like, the part of Natani‚Äôs Soul that was devestated by Isaac. Speaking of which. Whoever‚Äôs suggestion the ‚ÄúDefragmentation‚Äù suggestion is, that made me think of Natani‚Äôs brain as a terribly crashed hard drive."
10-11-2018T17:08:40,unsteddyphoenix,it healed when she fell in love~
10-11-2018T17:08:43,GC1983,"I feel like Trace is gonna be like. ""So it turns out she's just fat...I was wondering why she was pregnant for so many years"""
10-11-2018T17:08:49,ThingsAreMoving,"That's my suggestion, Darth"
10-11-2018T17:08:54,CrimsonQuill,"@DarthKeidren it was already down. I was trying to drag it from the interlocking branches. WITH INCH-LONG THORNS IN MY BOOTS. So, I snapped."
10-11-2018T17:08:56,ThingsAreMoving,:ctwokinds-keith8D:
10-11-2018T17:09:19,Beardedskynet,"Well, she did crash for a while."
10-11-2018T17:09:22,Vexd,Still makes me wonder if YoungNat is going to be plot critical at some point (besides her initial introduction)
10-11-2018T17:09:33,ThingsAreMoving,Reboot took a while due to system update
10-11-2018T17:09:44,DarthKeidran,@ThingsAreMoving good suggestion. I‚Äôve also thought of Natani as a mac that‚Äôs run into numerous problems due to her falling unconscious and a few other things.
10-11-2018T17:09:47,Mandag,"Man, that must've been rough for Zen."
10-11-2018T17:09:47,DarthKeidran,Xd
10-11-2018T17:09:57,ThingsAreMoving,Natani v 2.0 is now capable of offering breast touches to partner
10-11-2018T17:10:11,FennexTheFox,Wanna touch 'em?
10-11-2018T17:10:13,TerraTheWizard,lewd
10-11-2018T17:10:15,Mandag,OOOOh lingerie?
10-11-2018T17:10:15,Beardedskynet,That's why you don't put magic magnetic cuffs on the system network interface(AKA Zen)
10-11-2018T17:10:27,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúSo...do you wanna touch em?‚Äù
10-11-2018T17:10:34,w0lfmare,"Probably not, since Tom was debating getting rid of her after Natani's recovery :cw0lfmare-KiaHalo:"

10-11-2018T17:11:15,CrimsonQuill,sorry
10-11-2018T17:11:23,unsteddyphoenix,you SHOULD be
10-11-2018T17:11:28,CrimsonQuill,Me?
10-11-2018T17:11:28,Mandag,Kinda sad to think that youngNat shouldn't really exist. That part of her was completely obliterated by Isaac. You could write some pretty touching scenes with that concept in mind.
10-11-2018T17:11:38,DarthKeidran,Ok. That would be hilarious if Natani (Keith‚Äôs Body) wore the Lingerie Kat made just to mess with Keith.
10-11-2018T17:11:38,w0lfmare,"All good, it'll still be there when you get around to it :thumbsup:"
10-11-2018T17:11:44,unsteddyphoenix,YES. >:T

10-11-2018T17:12:56,CrimsonQuill,MAKE LIFE RUE THE DAY IT THOUGHT IT COULD GIVE CRIMSON QUILL LEMONS! DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?
10-11-2018T17:13:00,Mandag,I want Tom to draw Keith with an obnoxiously large bulge in that lingerie
10-11-2018T17:13:08,Tharkis,"lemons arent a natural fruit, they're man made by cross breeding a lime and a bitter citron"

10-11-2018T17:13:16,Tharkis,the lesson here is... life doesnt give you lemons
10-11-2018T17:13:19,ThingsAreMoving,"When life gives you lemons, make a cannon. Bitches love cannons"
10-11-2018T17:13:25,Tharkis,people messing around with genetics give you lemons !

10-11-2018T17:14:01,ShadowSoap,Salut Vatru!
10-11-2018T17:14:04,ThingsAreMoving,GM through selsctive breeding is as old as agricultire
10-11-2018T17:14:05,Bgrmystr2,@Mandag tom doesn't do that
10-11-2018T17:14:06,Tharkis,not very modern day =P

10-11-2018T17:14:22,CrimsonQuill,Lemons are now combustible.
10-11-2018T17:14:30,CrimsonQuill,Do I need to take a chill pill?

10-11-2018T17:15:14,Beardedskynet,What happened?
10-11-2018T17:15:15,TerraTheWizard,i still think it's weird americans consider still lemonade the default

10-11-2018T17:16:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Pretty sure Tom‚Äôs never drawn anything of the tent pants nature
10-11-2018T17:16:21,CrimsonQuill,"By the way, how expensive are SD Comic con tickets?"
10-11-2018T17:16:31,CrimsonQuill,I want to go there in the next year or two

10-11-2018T17:16:49,CrimsonQuill,But the flights alone look prohibtively expensive

10-11-2018T17:17:05,Mandag,"Nah, he's never drawn genital bulges. But I'm preeetty sure he's drawn straight-up porn though."
10-11-2018T17:17:06,Beardedskynet,"And when she drops her guard, that's when they pounce!"
10-11-2018T17:17:07,Bgrmystr2,could be the next image

10-11-2018T17:42:56,ThingsAreMoving,"nut, :ctwokinds-smug: point and leftclick, save as picture"
10-11-2018T17:43:17,ThingsAreMoving,rightclick for some

10-11-2018T17:43:38,MisterWho,"What is better to start - Redwall or The David Birkenhead Series, Omnibus Edition."
10-11-2018T17:43:41,Beardedskynet,Now it makes sense
10-11-2018T17:43:51,FennexTheFox,holy shit is this..
10-11-2018T17:43:52,MisterWho,Still on my ToDo amazon list.
10-11-2018T17:43:57,CatzArt,redwall has a pretty ease reading level.
10-11-2018T17:43:58,nutitoo,"i cant download it by clicking at it, it donwload this site"
10-11-2018T17:44:16,TerraTheWizard,??

10-11-2018T17:44:23,ThingsAreMoving,Then I don't know. I'm pretty new to this new computer stuff
10-11-2018T17:44:31,TerraTheWizard,the emote?
10-11-2018T17:44:31,ThingsAreMoving,:ctwokinds-smug: but here it is again
10-11-2018T17:44:48,SageSaga,:csagesaga-bounce:
10-11-2018T17:44:49,MisterWho,If you want the icons from chat - go in firefox into the webpage infos and pull it out of the cache.
10-11-2018T17:44:50,Mandag,Is 45 viewers a normal number for these streams? haven't been here in a while.
10-11-2018T17:45:03,ThingsAreMoving,150+ is the norm
10-11-2018T17:45:03,TerraTheWizard,"click subscribe, it shows you a screen with all the emotes"
10-11-2018T17:45:04,CatzArt,Ive never looked
10-11-2018T17:45:04,ShadowSoap,"Seems a bit low, to be honest"
10-11-2018T17:45:09,TerraTheWizard,you can right click save them there
10-11-2018T17:45:09,Beardedskynet,Picarto was acting up earlier
10-11-2018T17:45:18,Beardedskynet,was at 90ish
10-11-2018T17:45:31,TerraTheWizard,rather than going the inspect element route & finding the source file
10-11-2018T17:45:39,Mandag,Now it's about the same as the /trash/ general. That's not exactly grand.
10-11-2018T17:45:44,CatzArt,30-40 is average for Slightly Damned streams with Raizap. toms tend to be 40-60 i think
10-11-2018T17:45:45,w0lfmare,Picarto's viewer numbers aren't accurate right now
10-11-2018T17:45:48,WereKeidran,so what'd i miss?

10-11-2018T17:47:21,Bgrmystr2,"Quill please, you think one chat will break a site xD"
10-11-2018T17:47:21,CrimsonQuill,"Sigh,,,break the scouter Vegeta"

10-11-2018T17:48:04,CatzArt,besides you can always watch it later.
10-11-2018T17:48:13,CrimsonQuill,"I should go to bed too, but I love the stream. Where I am it's now 10:50pm."
10-11-2018T17:48:13,Mandag,But I wanna watch the big kitty and the brown doggo.
10-11-2018T17:48:17,MisterWho,"Will be fun, when furry8000 is on again. Last time we got a picarto Admin in chat. XD"

10-11-2018T18:11:33,CrimsonQuill,"@CatzArt the premise of 5 was great, it just wasn't handled so well."
10-11-2018T18:11:52,butidontwantto,Well i gave my vote and can go to bed. Have a good stream everybody!
10-11-2018T18:11:54,CatzArt,Men! This right here is 66 tons of straight up HE spewing DIVINE intervention!
10-11-2018T18:12:01,PalmettoPathfinder1,I do hope the Spartan Natani is a Tom Pick.

10-11-2018T18:13:12,HobbitGames,I think i just had a heart attack
10-11-2018T18:13:14,TheDixieNutjob,I was thinking this was a foreshortening hand
10-11-2018T18:13:22,TheDixieNutjob,until you zoomed in
10-11-2018T18:13:24,CatzArt,I know what you mean Crimson. But I have more Issues with five then just that. Blue team is supposed to be dead and most of osiris team had the personality of cardboard
10-11-2018T18:13:33,ThingsAreMoving,"Did you survive, Hobbit?"
10-11-2018T18:13:39,HobbitGames,Think so?
10-11-2018T18:13:45,Mandag,"Welp, guess I'll jump to bed then. Fucking timezones I swear..."
10-11-2018T18:13:48,CrimsonQuill,I liked Blue Team alive! And Buck at least had some great depth.
10-11-2018T18:13:49,PalmettoPathfinder1,A Spartan Nat would look awesome.
10-11-2018T18:13:53,CrimsonQuill,But the rest...
10-11-2018T18:14:00,ThingsAreMoving,Nice. Keep on livin
10-11-2018T18:14:11,CrimsonQuill,UNSC Spartan Raine. Let's make it happen.
10-11-2018T18:14:15,HobbitGames,I have yet to finish the game. Havent had much time
10-11-2018T18:14:25,CrimsonQuill,@HobbitGames which game?
10-11-2018T18:14:34,CatzArt,master chief was supposed to be the last spartan 2. know they are everywhere. Old halo fan complaints though.
10-11-2018T18:14:43,HobbitGames,Are yiz talking about the new AC game
10-11-2018T18:14:48,HobbitGames,O halo?
10-11-2018T18:14:51,CatzArt,no the halo series
10-11-2018T18:14:52,CrimsonQuill,@HobbitGames Halo.
10-11-2018T18:14:59,CrimsonQuill,I'm obsessed with Halo.
10-11-2018T18:15:16,MisterWho,Don't look at the ring! XD
10-11-2018T18:15:17,ThingsAreMoving,"Mike: *deep, resignated sigh* Kat: Huh... well looks like I have boobs to work on now."
10-11-2018T18:15:21,HobbitGames,Ahh. I played ODST and a bit of halo 3. Never got much into it to be honeat
10-11-2018T18:15:21,CrimsonQuill,I have a Spartan 4 model and pop vinyl chief on my windosill right now.
10-11-2018T18:15:23,SomeDudeNamedQ,"so uh, gender/species swaps are a popular theme..."
10-11-2018T18:15:28,CrimsonQuill,They're watching me.
10-11-2018T18:15:35,CrimsonQuill,Yep
10-11-2018T18:15:36,ProsePro7,Kick it Kirby
10-11-2018T18:15:39,CrimsonQuill,For some reason
10-11-2018T18:15:44,CatzArt,my last gripe with Halo 5 was that the game deviated to far from halo's core mechanics. didnt play like a halo game anymore.
10-11-2018T18:15:58,HobbitGames,Yay. Always love a bit a fem mike
10-11-2018T18:16:03,CatzArt,ive said my bit crimson I am done.

10-11-2018T18:16:06,CrimsonQuill,@CatzArt I want to see those mechanics-they seem very Doom to me.
10-11-2018T18:16:18,CrimsonQuill,I like the look of them.
10-11-2018T18:16:39,HobbitGames,"Hey, how bad is fallout 76?"
10-11-2018T18:16:50,KOTL,@HobbitGames very very bad
10-11-2018T18:16:52,CatzArt,play halo 3 multiplayer for a more accurate version of halos core gameplay
10-11-2018T18:16:55,ProsePro7,Speaking of shoot em ups anyone excited for Doom Eternal?
10-11-2018T18:16:58,Beardedskynet,Heard it's mixed ratings.
10-11-2018T18:17:06,HobbitGames,How very bad though?
10-11-2018T18:17:11,CrimsonQuill,I have Reach
10-11-2018T18:17:21,KOTL,Very broken and buggy beyond standard Bethesda levels
10-11-2018T18:17:22,CrimsonQuill,I want to play Eternal and the first one.
10-11-2018T18:17:27,CatzArt,Fallout is a multiplayer fallout 4 sandbox. thats enough for me
10-11-2018T18:17:33,CrimsonQuill,My PC Can't handle 2016 Doom.
10-11-2018T18:17:42,KOTL,fallout 4 visuals but has greater system requirements
10-11-2018T18:17:43,HobbitGames,"Yeah, well it was the beta. Theyll prob make it standard bethesda level"
10-11-2018T18:17:44,CrimsonQuill,So I'm doomed.

10-11-2018T18:23:00,MarshallMelon,Nah they've used Cloudflare for years. If that's the case it'd also be causing slow connections/
10-11-2018T18:23:17,ThingsAreMoving,Well... european stream servers are working
10-11-2018T18:23:19,CatzArt,"the virus is spreading we must halt this infection. We must dig in ""Not one step Back"" first man gets a rifle second man gets ammunition when first man falls second man picks up rifle."
10-11-2018T18:23:50,PalmettoPathfinder1,You know I think Natani would look good dressed up as Pharah from Overwatch with either the Anubis or Thunderbird skin.
10-11-2018T18:24:14,CatzArt,Sorry just watched enemy at the gates so im still in war mode. Anubis skin definantly

10-11-2018T18:27:20,KOTL,I think Kat might give up on massages if the trend of people turning continues
10-11-2018T18:27:21,PalmettoPathfinder1,I think the next artbook should be crossovers or cosplay.

10-11-2018T18:54:22,SageSaga,i can draw without them- sure- but its more of a trick than a boon to not use them
10-11-2018T18:54:25,CatzArt,True sage. But since I draw traditionally I get noodle drawing syndrome often. been using a non photo blue pencil for construction lines which helps but...

10-11-2018T18:55:25,SageSaga,they all use construction lines and shapes and only dont when showing off
10-11-2018T18:55:32,HobbitGames,"See, I cant draw geometric shapes without an aid."
10-11-2018T18:56:07,HobbitGames,Im much better at drawing free flowing and asymmetrical things
10-11-2018T18:56:13,CatzArt,Yeah sage thats cool. I would still consider myself a beginner artist so i need them for anatomy sake.
10-11-2018T18:56:16,ThingsAreMoving,I can cut potatoes into nice geometric shapes. Drawing them is impossible for me though
10-11-2018T18:56:27,unsteddyphoenix,Sphere potato
10-11-2018T18:56:30,SageSaga,"not using them is more of a ""Watch me draw stuff"" thing - it's what Caricature artists do"
10-11-2018T18:56:31,ThingsAreMoving,can do
10-11-2018T18:56:42,unsteddyphoenix,Delicious

10-11-2018T18:56:57,unsteddyphoenix,bai
10-11-2018T18:56:57,Ordithus,bye kts
10-11-2018T18:57:06,SageSaga,its for your entertainment to see someone create a picture out of seemingly nothing
10-11-2018T18:57:24,HobbitGames,"I try to use them, but i end up spending kore time trying to draw them than i would just drawing it without them"
10-11-2018T18:57:30,ThingsAreMoving,"Ord, you want me to make a potato klein bottle?"
10-11-2018T18:57:39,CatzArt,ah I would still like to see tom use them once though
10-11-2018T18:57:52,SageSaga,he still uses them
10-11-2018T18:57:55,Ordithus,"Yes, please, do it!"
10-11-2018T18:58:02,SageSaga,hes even used them in this drawing but sparingly
10-11-2018T18:58:11,ThingsAreMoving,"brb, gotta divide a potato by zero"
10-11-2018T18:58:23,RandomTonio,More Colin
10-11-2018T18:58:24,SageSaga,see- he just erased one
10-11-2018T18:58:27,Ordithus,Tom seems to use them more for poses he's less familiar with
10-11-2018T18:58:28,HobbitGames,No dont! Youll doom us all!
10-11-2018T18:58:34,Bgrmystr2,I don't see any kind of grid sage
10-11-2018T18:58:34,KOTL,never divide a potato by zero
10-11-2018T18:58:37,Bgrmystr2,not sure what you're lookin at
10-11-2018T18:58:43,ThingsAreMoving,the shoulder
10-11-2018T18:58:45,ThingsAreMoving,probably
10-11-2018T18:58:48,SageSaga,construction lines arent a grid
10-11-2018T18:58:57,Xexanoth,fluffy pillow :ptv-hearts:
10-11-2018T18:58:58,ThingsAreMoving,"no potatoes in the pantry, forgot to stock up."
10-11-2018T18:59:03,CatzArt,Hobbit try looking up How to draw Furries by Imaginatively Unimaginative. I use a variation of his format over my older style from my older art books
10-11-2018T18:59:06,unsteddyphoenix,D:
10-11-2018T18:59:13,Bgrmystr2,then I dunno what you're referencing
10-11-2018T18:59:15,SageSaga,they are the basic shapes and lines you use to guide your drawing
10-11-2018T18:59:16,Ordithus,:potato:
10-11-2018T18:59:19,HobbitGames,Who said they were a grid?
10-11-2018T18:59:24,Bgrmystr2,so just.. the sketch lines..?
10-11-2018T18:59:39,Roserain,"like drawing a stick figure, or building up circles to give a rough shape and size estimation"
10-11-2018T18:59:41,Ordithus,The sketchier sketch lines
10-11-2018T18:59:42,CatzArt,"I just use circles, squares and lines. nothing more nothing less"
10-11-2018T18:59:46,RimaDraws,welp i may head off for real this time.
10-11-2018T18:59:47,SageSaga,the sketchy looking lines are called guide lines or construction lines
10-11-2018T18:59:55,SageSaga,but the image itself is a sketch
10-11-2018T18:59:58,CatzArt,bye rima

10-11-2018T19:00:42,HobbitGames,Bye all
10-11-2018T19:00:45,Ordithus,Night Hobbit
10-11-2018T19:00:46,SageSaga,they call them construction lines because they build the basic shape of what you want to sketch
10-11-2018T19:00:46,ThingsAreMoving,o/ Hobbit
10-11-2018T19:00:50,FoxxTrotter,"G'night, Hobbit."
10-11-2018T19:01:02,CatzArt,people used to tell me you had to be born an artist. not really you just need to practice and practice and practice. night hobbit
10-11-2018T19:01:09,SageSaga,other call them guide lines because they guide how you want it to look- but they arent a hard guide
10-11-2018T19:01:26,SageSaga,this is also a form of construction lines
10-11-2018T19:01:34,Bgrmystr2,I've never seen anyone call em that. I've seen people use grids and call it construction lines
10-11-2018T19:01:37,Bgrmystr2,like a graph paper
10-11-2018T19:01:37,totallynotTrace,"guide lines are typically not included in the final drawing by either drawing over them or erasing them, just as in construction scafolding would be built and taken down as needed and not part of final product"
10-11-2018T19:01:48,SageSaga,benefits of this include using opacity to show depth
10-11-2018T19:01:49,ThingsAreMoving,this looks like construction areas now
10-11-2018T19:01:57,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:

10-11-2018T19:02:10,CatzArt,i call em guide lines. I use a blue pencil for them then go over it with a pencil then ink it

10-11-2018T19:03:00,SageSaga,Tom knows my feelings on Guide/Construction lines very well as ive done this speech before XD
10-11-2018T19:03:00,CatzArt,hi
10-11-2018T19:03:07,ShadowSoap,'Ello Phil
10-11-2018T19:03:10,Ordithus,Hi phil

10-11-2018T19:04:23,ThingsAreMoving,o/ phil
10-11-2018T19:04:31,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, Phil."
10-11-2018T19:05:02,SageSaga,oh man - that reminds me of that guy claiming im hording comic and art making secrets for myself to keep younger artists down
10-11-2018T19:05:27,unsteddyphoenix,Woah sage how dare you >:T
10-11-2018T19:05:28,totallynotTrace,that doesnt even make sense
10-11-2018T19:05:31,unsteddyphoenix,Gimme them secrets
10-11-2018T19:05:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,could these two be any cuter?
10-11-2018T19:05:48,ThingsAreMoving,and sell that art when you fake your death and become a millionare?
10-11-2018T19:05:53,phil199,that¬¥s nothing that makes much sense
10-11-2018T19:05:53,ThingsAreMoving,crafty
10-11-2018T19:05:58,SageSaga,Marv- yes
10-11-2018T19:06:03,Ordithus,I bet Sage has been leading us astray this whole time :ctwokinds-clovischuckle:
10-11-2018T19:06:05,Xexanoth,sam snuggling him put colin into a higher state of mind...or he's possessed
10-11-2018T19:06:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,prove it
10-11-2018T19:06:19,unsteddyphoenix,Sages method: give Sam huge boobers
10-11-2018T19:06:20,ThingsAreMoving,Marv you'd need to take ~5 years off of each of them
10-11-2018T19:06:25,Ordithus,haha
10-11-2018T19:06:29,Xexanoth,and there goes my joke...
10-11-2018T19:06:38,unsteddyphoenix,Also colin
10-11-2018T19:07:00,SageSaga,have her facing him and just burring her face in is floof
10-11-2018T19:07:08,SageSaga,in his*

10-11-2018T19:07:08,unsteddyphoenix,Gender bending these two could be pretty funny...
10-11-2018T19:07:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,......
10-11-2018T19:07:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,All the yes
10-11-2018T19:07:23,CatzArt,No Pheonix we have been over this
10-11-2018T19:07:31,w0lfmare,"Say Sage, what made you decide to start your AI comic?"
10-11-2018T19:07:45,ThingsAreMoving,I don't know about that unfteddy
10-11-2018T19:07:50,Bgrmystr2,lol sage tom drew that earlier
10-11-2018T19:07:51,Bgrmystr2,in the stream
10-11-2018T19:07:53,ThingsAreMoving,I feel it would be a bit... creepy
10-11-2018T19:07:55,Bgrmystr2,we saw it already
10-11-2018T19:07:56,phil199,face into fluff is always a good idea
10-11-2018T19:07:57,CatzArt,I would like to know too since ill be starting my own soon
10-11-2018T19:07:57,totallynotTrace,GENDER BEND ALL THE THINGS (and people)!!!!
10-11-2018T19:08:09,SageSaga,I have several comic ideas ive been wanting to start
10-11-2018T19:08:10,ThingsAreMoving,Don't genderbend me!
10-11-2018T19:08:15,unsteddyphoenix,bro
10-11-2018T19:08:22,Ordithus,But then you find out you're allergic to doggo
10-11-2018T19:08:49,SageSaga,and i had spent a year working on AI specifically to get it ready -
10-11-2018T19:08:49,CatzArt,No Not Trace. no genderbending. you must come to the light or the vigil of Stendarr will drag you to it
10-11-2018T19:09:12,SageSaga,i kept putting it off because of lack of time- but after ending my job and going full time artist i went for it
10-11-2018T19:09:29,SageSaga,and now im just hoping it makes more money and takes off so i can also plan for new series
10-11-2018T19:09:33,totallynotTrace,"Catz, please name a TK carcacter that has not bean gender bent"
10-11-2018T19:09:34,CatzArt,thats a big leap and we are glad you took it.

10-11-2018T19:10:17,SageSaga,i barely make enough to live on though

10-11-2018T19:10:33,Ordithus,Keep artin'
10-11-2018T19:10:35,Bgrmystr2,Nora's a dragon but.. yeah she hasn't been touched either
10-11-2018T19:10:40,CatzArt,do you have a patreon Sage?
10-11-2018T19:10:44,Ordithus,He do
10-11-2018T19:10:46,SageSaga,yep
10-11-2018T19:10:47,Bgrmystr2,yeah he does
10-11-2018T19:10:56,Xexanoth,pretty sure that mal cat touched her :ptv-kippi:
10-11-2018T19:11:02,totallynotTrace,Nora doesnt need to begender bent to be FREAKY
10-11-2018T19:11:03,w0lfmare,"I'm thinking about doing another comic too, but there are issues with speed and quality"
10-11-2018T19:11:03,Xexanoth,male
10-11-2018T19:11:16,PalmettoPathfinder1,You know I wonder what a Keidran/Basitin hybrid would look like.  I think Natani's glaring at me now because of that thought.  Cowers before Natani's awesomeness.
10-11-2018T19:11:18,Bgrmystr2,"yeah but because she hasn't been, she applies to the listr"
10-11-2018T19:11:32,SageSaga,Patreon got back to me recently- they set me to 18+ only even though i dont draw adult artwork
10-11-2018T19:11:38,w0lfmare,"I've considered bringing on another artist, but I don't think I could find one that fits my vision"
10-11-2018T19:11:39,CatzArt,heh it takes me 6 hours to do a full body sketch I couldnt imagine doing a page a week
10-11-2018T19:11:40,Ordithus,Sam so cute! :ptv-excited: (Colin too)
10-11-2018T19:11:54,SageSaga,i do 4 pages a week
10-11-2018T19:11:56,MarshallMelon,I think even implied lewdness is enough to set them off now Sage
10-11-2018T19:12:08,totallynotTrace,Palmetto: tom did a full color drawing a few months back showing Lauras & keiths possible kids
10-11-2018T19:12:09,MarshallMelon,A lot of it is likely automated
10-11-2018T19:12:15,Ordithus,You've definitely got the drive to succeed
10-11-2018T19:12:18,ThingsAreMoving,4 a week? That's a lot
10-11-2018T19:12:18,CatzArt,No idea how you do it sage. guess its an experience thing
10-11-2018T19:12:26,SageSaga,implied nudity- and i had a person go over it and they still said they wont remove it
10-11-2018T19:12:30,ThingsAreMoving,carefull not to burn yourself out
10-11-2018T19:12:38,MarshallMelon,"Yep, sounds about right"
10-11-2018T19:12:54,PalmettoPathfinder1,Oh yeah he did.  I think Patreon is cracking down on questionable stuff these days.
10-11-2018T19:12:59,CatzArt,yeah sage dont burn yourself out. long haul
10-11-2018T19:13:04,SageSaga,ive been doing 3 a week for over 13 years and for the past 2 years been doing 4 a week- seems fine
10-11-2018T19:13:07,Bgrmystr2,Patreon is only going to get worse
10-11-2018T19:13:24,MarshallMelon,That's what happens when there's no viable competitor
10-11-2018T19:13:30,Bgrmystr2,yeah exactly
10-11-2018T19:13:34,CatzArt,at least patreon doesnt ban it out right
10-11-2018T19:13:34,SageSaga,jeez Bgr- when did you become a negative Nancy?
10-11-2018T19:13:35,MarshallMelon,See also: YouTube and the Adpocalypse
10-11-2018T19:13:37,PalmettoPathfinder1,My thoughts exactly.
10-11-2018T19:13:52,Bgrmystr2,"I'm not a negative nancy, Sage. I'm a realist."
10-11-2018T19:13:56,Bgrmystr2,And I learn from history
10-11-2018T19:14:08,Bgrmystr2,"when there's no viable competitor, they abuse it."
10-11-2018T19:14:11,Nickname33,fair enough
10-11-2018T19:14:12,Bgrmystr2,it happens.
10-11-2018T19:14:14,Xexanoth,youtube is the advertisment companies faults though
10-11-2018T19:14:23,Nickname33,i mean they ruined the logo
10-11-2018T19:14:26,Nickname33,whats next?
10-11-2018T19:14:26,w0lfmare,Yeah I don't think it's safe to rely on Patreon alone
10-11-2018T19:14:30,Mippy,I see a Doggie chair
10-11-2018T19:14:41,Xexanoth,in the end youtube is the one who looses the most money thanks to adpocalypse
10-11-2018T19:14:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Thats a mighty big couch
10-11-2018T19:14:47,w0lfmare,There's a risk having all eggs in one basket
10-11-2018T19:14:49,SageSaga,i dont need this realism Bgr- take it away!
10-11-2018T19:15:01,w0lfmare,Even if it's a good basket
10-11-2018T19:15:02,MarshallMelon,Get your realism out of my reality goddamnit
10-11-2018T19:15:10,ThingsAreMoving,Bgr bends this reality and substitutes one of his own
10-11-2018T19:15:14,Bgrmystr2,xD Just cuz I don't speak about it doesn't mean it won't affect you later xD
10-11-2018T19:15:21,Bgrmystr2,No no things
10-11-2018T19:15:26,ThingsAreMoving,no?
10-11-2018T19:15:30,ThingsAreMoving,that  wasn't you?
10-11-2018T19:15:35,Bgrmystr2,I accept other people's realities and manipulate them in a way they don't understand
10-11-2018T19:15:37,Bgrmystr2,it's very different.
10-11-2018T19:15:39,ThingsAreMoving,oooh

10-11-2018T19:17:14,PalmettoPathfinder1,Elon Musk has said that he wants to buy Facebook and then shut it down.  He says it causes a lot of problems. And he doesn't even use Facebook as it creeps him out!
10-11-2018T19:17:28,KOTL,Xex that will be more of a throne than a simple chair

10-11-2018T19:22:43,Mippy,Next suggestion: Colin uses Sam as a chair
10-11-2018T19:22:44,PalmettoPathfinder1,XCOM and XCOM 2 is good.
10-11-2018T19:22:50,Xexanoth,valve openly said that they aren't working on it since it could never live up to the hype
10-11-2018T19:23:03,Xexanoth,that's been the status for the last 2 or 3 years
10-11-2018T19:23:09,CatzArt,good on valve
10-11-2018T19:23:11,Ordithus,Eventually there will be no hype
10-11-2018T19:23:15,ProsePro7,This is one of the more suggestive sketches of the night

10-11-2018T19:23:30,TerraTheWizard,also valve's company structure doesn't support making large games any more
10-11-2018T19:24:01,CatzArt,I need a tally marker for every suggestive theme one of us mentions.
10-11-2018T19:24:02,ThingsAreMoving,they have so much money they can make a separate company that would focus on game making
10-11-2018T19:24:04,Mippy,What is wrong with the vote if this is suggestive Prose
10-11-2018T19:24:06,ThingsAreMoving,if they wanted to
10-11-2018T19:24:08,Ordithus,I suppose.  AAA games are hard to make worthwhile nowadays
10-11-2018T19:24:17,TerraTheWizard,"they work on a ""form your own group for a project"""
10-11-2018T19:24:23,Xexanoth,"i mean they stopped working on half life 3 before they got dota i think, they just made the whole not working on it public eventually"
10-11-2018T19:24:25,TerraTheWizard,but HL3 would need everyone
10-11-2018T19:24:38,ProsePro7,Indie games are far more creative
10-11-2018T19:24:50,Ordithus,They're far less constrained.  Way less risk
10-11-2018T19:24:50,PalmettoPathfinder1,Indeed.
10-11-2018T19:25:00,ProsePro7,Look at Undeertale and its sequal
10-11-2018T19:25:13,CatzArt,Yeah ord its more graphics over good story and game play. thats why Kingdome Come Delieverance was such a breath of fresh air. Those eastern Europeans sure can make a game
10-11-2018T19:25:14,PalmettoPathfinder1,Or look at Stars in Shadows or even the game Tunic.
10-11-2018T19:25:22,Renfear,I just flipped back over. This is adorable!

10-11-2018T19:26:18,TerraTheWizard,no more charts :V
10-11-2018T19:26:23,CatzArt,I would like to make a side scroller in the vain of Rolling Thunder or a text based game like Trials in Tainted Space. But i need to learn some coding for that
10-11-2018T19:26:23,ThingsAreMoving,Seems like Sam's favorite thing to do is to make Colin flustered/uncomfortable.
10-11-2018T19:26:27,PalmettoPathfinder1,Tunic is an indie game that is being developed by one guy and people are looking forward to it.  It involves a cute fox wearing a green tunic fighting evil.
10-11-2018T19:26:29,Bgrmystr2,"just for that, all the charts Terra"

10-11-2018T22:09:28,PalmettoPathfinder1,Hopefully my video game cosplay suggestion will do better next week.
10-11-2018T22:10:41,w0lfmare,Best of luck :thumbsup:
10-11-2018T22:11:52,Twokinds,lol
10-11-2018T22:11:59,Twokinds,It's a very fanservicey suggestion.
10-11-2018T22:12:07,Twokinds,I'm sure it'll get picked eventually.
10-11-2018T22:12:32,Ordithus,I guess most people don't know much about the characters of the cosplay
10-11-2018T22:14:08,Twokinds,Yeah I don't think there's a lot of fighting game players
10-11-2018T22:14:11,Twokinds,It's pretty niche
10-11-2018T22:14:36,Ordithus,Nat as Ivy :ptv-ohmy:
10-11-2018T22:15:11,FenceEqualizer,At least fighting game players that watch tk stream
10-11-2018T23:30:06,BluePhantom90,Btw Tom your making more then 6k now. You could possibly hire a assistant to help with the work load. could make that a tax write off too
10-11-2018T23:31:24,BluePhantom90,have someone do the nora cards coloring and all that.
10-11-2018T23:31:59,Twokinds,Haha
10-11-2018T23:32:12,Twokinds,"Maybe help with other stuff, but people pay to have ME do the Nora Cards"
10-11-2018T23:34:19,BluePhantom90,Hmm true. but having a assistant do some coloring or something to help with the work load. It seems like your buried with so much work.
10-11-2018T23:35:27,PalmettoPathfinder1,that's true.
10-11-2018T23:36:21,Ordithus,Pay mods.  One peanut per ban
10-11-2018T23:37:06,PalmettoPathfinder1,"lol!  I mean, a coloring assistant might be able to help get the comic updates out a lot quicker."
10-11-2018T23:37:21,BluePhantom90,in a way your kinda trapped by your own work. Unless you trust the assistant to color comic pages.
10-11-2018T23:38:33,BluePhantom90,"Sketches, Nora Cards, color votes. All kinda make it so you are the only person to do the work."
10-11-2018T23:38:50,Twokinds,Maybe for side comics I will get help
10-11-2018T23:40:46,BluePhantom90,well I offered a Idea. I know how buried you are in your work.
