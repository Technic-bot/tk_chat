10-07-2018T09:33:38,TorqueEmUp,Morning everyone
10-07-2018T10:08:24,SiliconCarbide,hey there
10-07-2018T11:08:26,NightMeaty22,Good morning
10-07-2018T11:19:35,BadFoMo,Yo.
10-07-2018T13:37:13,RafaelRC,heya
10-07-2018T14:38:32,Twokinds,Comic-Con's going to be boring with no one there with me this year... :(
10-07-2018T14:43:13,SiliconCarbide,perfect opportunity to make new friends there!
10-07-2018T14:44:36,Twokinds,That's true
10-07-2018T15:05:57,SpazztasticKiwi,And no one to buffer the crowds either...
10-07-2018T15:10:04,TorqueEmUp,"That does suck. So boring to go to a con alone, especially if you're going to be stuck at a table all day."
10-07-2018T15:10:20,TorqueEmUp,Then no one to hang with after the fact
10-07-2018T15:50:24,TorqueEmUp,rip
10-07-2018T16:17:34,Mippy,:ptv-sleepy: Feelingg the mid-day nap...but can't. :ptv-sad:
10-07-2018T16:38:25,Bgrmystr2,"if you slept properly at night, you wouldn't feel like that."
10-07-2018T16:43:08,Mippy,I try but sometimes the anxiety wont let me. I'm trying to stop waking up at 4am so gotta stay up all day to make sure I'm properly sleepy.
10-07-2018T16:44:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"There was a wailing kid at work today (surprise surprise) and after a few minutes a manager muttered “Jesus, kid. The power of Christ compels you.”"
10-07-2018T16:44:40,Mippy,lol
10-07-2018T16:45:11,Twokinds,Yeah
10-07-2018T16:45:18,SpazztasticKiwi,About four of us sitting around try not to die laughing
10-07-2018T16:45:51,Twokinds,Athrocon was fun because I had all those other artists from Katbox there.
10-07-2018T16:45:54,Bgrmystr2,xD
10-07-2018T16:46:18,Bgrmystr2,so you weren't weirded out by the fursuiters then? :u
10-07-2018T16:48:00,Twokinds,"Thought I might be, but it turned out fine."
10-07-2018T16:48:10,Bgrmystr2,glad to hear
10-07-2018T16:48:21,Bgrmystr2,you plan to go to future anthrocons? :o
10-07-2018T16:50:01,Mippy,Closest thing I get to Antrocon is watching our resturant mascot suit up. =(
10-07-2018T16:50:48,Twokinds,"Yeah I think so, if I get the opportunity."
10-07-2018T16:51:02,Bgrmystr2,nice
10-07-2018T16:51:11,Bgrmystr2,I hope to go one day
10-07-2018T16:51:13,Bgrmystr2,:(
10-07-2018T16:51:47,Mippy,"Cool, maybe I'll see you there one day in the future...but as it stands my budget dose not allow for out of country travel."
10-07-2018T16:52:15,Bgrmystr2,"I couldn't go to a convention in my own city without friends helping me out, so.."
10-07-2018T16:52:21,Bgrmystr2,nevermind across the country
10-07-2018T16:53:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"If it’s local enough and I can get the time off for it, I’d swing by for one"
10-07-2018T16:53:51,Mippy,Our local cons are free admitance so I'm able to get in and participate...but as for buying stuff...
10-07-2018T16:53:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Local fur con for me is I think Mississippi though
10-07-2018T16:54:12,Bgrmystr2,we don't have anything special
10-07-2018T16:54:17,Bgrmystr2,just a small anime con
10-07-2018T16:54:42,Mippy,Our local fury specific con is in Calgary....I think...could be Edmonton
10-07-2018T16:55:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I might just have to ask my friend if she knows any other cons. She’d know better
10-07-2018T16:58:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"I saw a few fur suits at PAX, despite it being a game convention"
10-07-2018T17:00:17,Mippy,I saw a guy dresed as Chewbacca at the local con...dose that count?
10-07-2018T17:00:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel that’s more of a fur cosplay
10-07-2018T17:00:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Fursplay
10-07-2018T17:01:05,Mippy,Also...as I mentiond before our resturant mascot...he's a bear
10-07-2018T17:01:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw a Crash Badicoot suit. Probably my favorite
10-07-2018T17:01:38,Mippy,Fursplay...I like that
10-07-2018T17:01:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I combine words often
10-07-2018T17:02:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Makes for some creative swearing
10-07-2018T17:11:07,Bgrmystr2,"it's a cosplay of a character, so I mean.. why create a new name for it kiwi?"
10-07-2018T17:17:30,SpazztasticKiwi,For the hell of it
10-07-2018T17:17:43,SpazztasticKiwi,You don’t have to question everything
10-07-2018T17:18:36,Bgrmystr2,"but I can, and that's the beauty of it. :D"
10-07-2018T17:19:00,Bgrmystr2,"Still, a name already exists and you're gonna make a new one.."
10-07-2018T17:19:01,Bgrmystr2,like..
10-07-2018T17:19:11,Bgrmystr2,we already have one :ptv-wondering:
10-07-2018T17:26:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"Again, for the hell of it"
10-07-2018T17:26:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Use it for yourself if you want or not
10-07-2018T17:27:43,Bgrmystr2,"I'll use the name we've already come up with that everyone already knows, thanks. :)"
10-07-2018T18:18:56,Dadrobit,"I know that this conversation is over, but I just want to pop in and mention the fact that ""fursplay"" is dangerously close to ""foreplay""..."
10-07-2018T18:19:14,Dadrobit,You may want to rethink that term.
10-07-2018T18:21:38,Bgrmystr2,"or it could be a term aptly describing it.. furry foreplay, or furplay :ptv-wondering:"
10-07-2018T18:22:12,Bgrmystr2,seems more pun than something you'd actually use thoug
10-07-2018T18:22:14,Bgrmystr2,though*
10-07-2018T21:07:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Eh nm on the horse thingy
10-07-2018T21:08:03,Ordithus,Today's sketch is just :ptv-hearts:
10-07-2018T21:08:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Already did one anyway
10-07-2018T21:13:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom why don’t you just explore for yourself while you’re at the con alone
10-07-2018T21:16:24,BadFoMo,Do what?
10-07-2018T21:20:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Think it’s SDCC - he’s the only one going
10-07-2018T21:21:39,Ordithus,"He usually is there with the Keenspot crew and Mark, right?"
10-07-2018T21:21:55,CrRAR,gotta do table duties though too.
10-07-2018T21:27:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark’s gonna be somewhere on the near other side of the world
10-07-2018T21:28:52,SpazztasticKiwi,On the 14 anyway
10-07-2018T21:30:29,SpazztasticKiwi,What is up my Keenspot Crew
10-07-2018T21:30:54,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
10-07-2018T21:31:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Nibbly is what’s up apparently
10-07-2018T21:32:14,Bgrmystr2,whaaaaat this sketch is amazing
10-07-2018T21:32:29,Bgrmystr2,I've never seen this suggestion
10-07-2018T21:32:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I e seen so many of the people I follow show evidence of going to SDCC
10-07-2018T21:32:39,SpazztasticKiwi,*i’ve
10-07-2018T22:12:00,CrRAR,Yeah SDCC is like THE mecca for all things creative fantasy.
10-07-2018T22:36:34,SpazztasticKiwi,You haven’t seen cute until you’ve seen a munchkin cat
10-07-2018T22:46:10,BluePhantom90,Hey Tom you alive?
10-07-2018T22:48:22,Bgrmystr2,"Can someone so immortal be considered ""alive""?"
10-07-2018T22:49:06,BluePhantom90,well I say alive as in is he alive in the chat or some other chat or just not paying attention to this chat
10-07-2018T22:51:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Pssst try luring him out with something
10-07-2018T22:51:11,Bgrmystr2,fairly sure there isn't another chat
10-07-2018T22:51:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Probably just waiting for something interesting to happen in chat first though
10-07-2018T22:59:03,BluePhantom90,a old chat that his web site with the comic leads too yes
10-07-2018T23:07:05,BluePhantom90,"wanted to Know if Tom knew of a old movie called ""Cats Don't Dance"""
10-07-2018T23:11:57,Mippy,Cats Don't Dance is old?!
10-07-2018T23:12:04,Bgrmystr2,"he frequents that chat just as much as this one, Blue"
10-07-2018T23:12:49,Bgrmystr2,"sometimes he's there, sometimes he isn't. Almost never seems to be there when ya wanna ask him somethin :P"
10-07-2018T23:21:03,BluePhantom90,its old yes
10-07-2018T23:21:30,BluePhantom90,1997 is old
10-07-2018T23:22:35,Mippy,I was 7 in '97....:ptv-confused: It's not really old to me.
10-07-2018T23:23:14,BluePhantom90,Well we think its not old. BUT anyone born in 2000 yeah its old
10-07-2018T23:24:00,Bgrmystr2,naw they're just young
10-07-2018T23:24:03,Bgrmystr2,:P
10-07-2018T23:24:45,BluePhantom90,"In military its old. I mean I can talk about the old transformers shows, They be like ""Your a dinosor""."
10-07-2018T23:25:12,Bgrmystr2,then they're just snot-nosed shits
10-07-2018T23:25:14,Bgrmystr2,ignore them
10-07-2018T23:25:18,BluePhantom90,lol
10-07-2018T23:25:31,BluePhantom90,true but I wont deny its old.
10-07-2018T23:25:43,Bgrmystr2,"I will, cuz it's really not."
10-07-2018T23:25:56,Mippy,I doubt everyone in the military considers it old
10-07-2018T23:26:26,Mippy,Are all your military people under 20?
10-07-2018T23:26:35,Bgrmystr2,just the young kids who think anything before 2000 is old
10-07-2018T23:26:50,Bgrmystr2,probably even after 2000
10-07-2018T23:28:15,Mippy,Try watching Nosferatu or The Cabinet of Dr.Caligari....then we can probuby talk dinosar
10-07-2018T23:29:25,BluePhantom90,Land before time?
10-07-2018T23:29:47,Bgrmystr2,seriously? xD
10-07-2018T23:30:18,BluePhantom90,lol I mean Floppy disk's we all knew back before 2000 of the Stuggle with them
10-07-2018T23:30:46,Mippy,Great movie. A couple of years before I was born Blue...but it's not that much older than me
10-07-2018T23:30:54,Bgrmystr2,"""struggle"" I didn't have any issues with them."
10-07-2018T23:31:35,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, I still like Floppies over CDs simply because they, like flash drives, you just plug them in and they work. You can write / rewrite, copy remove, any individual anything"
10-07-2018T23:32:01,BluePhantom90,lol
10-07-2018T23:32:02,Bgrmystr2,"floppies are very versatile, though they're very small"
10-07-2018T23:32:07,Bgrmystr2,CDs are not
10-07-2018T23:32:26,Mippy,We used floppy's one year in school because we had to type up our projects and not everyoe had a computer or typewritter. The floppys was so you could save your work without having it tamperd with.
10-07-2018T23:32:33,Bgrmystr2,flash drives really are the successor floppies
10-07-2018T23:32:36,BluePhantom90,Or the connecting to internet by phone line. Having to disconnect because mom or dad wanted to use the phone
10-07-2018T23:33:18,Bgrmystr2,"when I went to school, literally noone had computers in my classes."
10-07-2018T23:33:28,Bgrmystr2,everyone wrote by hand
10-07-2018T23:33:35,Mippy,*blink* What internet? I did not have the internet. You think everyone had the internet?
10-07-2018T23:34:22,Bgrmystr2,"we had the net back when my family moved to GA back in 1990 cuz my dad was in the navy,"
10-07-2018T23:34:33,Bgrmystr2,had two phone lines installed into the house
10-07-2018T23:34:39,Bgrmystr2,"one for the network, one for the phone"
10-07-2018T23:35:01,BluePhantom90,lucky you
10-07-2018T23:35:16,Bgrmystr2,"hm, luck really nothing to do with it"
10-07-2018T23:35:44,BluePhantom90,yeah I had a type writer... r-r kinda miss those things. Love the sound they made
10-07-2018T23:36:23,Mippy,"The ""rich"" kids had computers. I had the school computer lab (I think the computers were from the 80's) and a typewritter. I remember my class being so exited when we finally got our computer upgrade in '98...I think it was"
10-07-2018T23:37:17,BluePhantom90,it was the 1998 yeah. They got cheaper so schools starting teaching kids how to use the computers
10-07-2018T23:37:24,Bgrmystr2,"lol, I remember having my own computer back in 94, 95.. ish. Don't remember when I first got it though."
10-07-2018T23:37:31,Mippy,My school had a crap budget
10-07-2018T23:38:12,Bgrmystr2,"granted by the time we moved from GA, we had a debt of some ridiculous amount"
10-07-2018T23:38:26,Bgrmystr2,cuz the business my dad had died out
10-07-2018T23:38:27,Bgrmystr2,:/
10-07-2018T23:39:24,Bgrmystr2,"yknow, I would trade the benefits I had of my youth for my parents to not have torn apart"
10-07-2018T23:39:39,Bgrmystr2,no amount of stuff will make you happy
10-07-2018T23:39:43,Mippy,Dang.... Don't know how that compares to being a welfare kid
10-07-2018T23:40:09,Mippy,My parents are still together...despitte everything they have been through
10-07-2018T23:40:14,Bgrmystr2,"even if you're on welfare, or in the poor house, etc, you can still be happy, and have a supportive family"
10-07-2018T23:40:53,Mippy,"Yeah, exept we were not happy"
10-07-2018T23:40:55,Bgrmystr2,but all the toys in the world wouldn't fix the shipwreck that was my family when I was a kid :/
10-07-2018T23:42:02,Bgrmystr2,somethin I learned the hard way
10-07-2018T23:42:06,BluePhantom90,..... My parents separated and my dad died a month after I got back from Afghanistan in Dec 2011
10-07-2018T23:42:25,BluePhantom90,SO yeah... not fun
10-07-2018T23:59:26,Mippy,I had no idea there were so many different types of bacon:ptv-wondering:
