05-09-2018T00:07:24,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao
05-09-2018T00:07:33,unsteddyphoenix,That would be a factor yeah

05-09-2018T13:14:19,Twokinds,I'll remember your suggestion for next week
05-09-2018T13:27:41,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds What do you know/like/dislike about Halo?
05-09-2018T13:28:08,Twokinds,I've only played a little of the first Halo
05-09-2018T13:28:36,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds I've never played the first one. I pnly have 4 and Reach.
05-09-2018T13:28:51,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds I know lots of the lore though.
05-09-2018T13:28:57,CrimsonQuill,How did you find it?
05-09-2018T13:29:05,CrimsonQuill,The first Halo
05-09-2018T13:30:49,Twokinds,I was never very interested in Halo
05-09-2018T13:31:01,Twokinds,I was a PC gamer.
05-09-2018T13:31:19,CrimsonQuill,I'm only really pc gaming now.
05-09-2018T13:31:28,CrimsonQuill,But I really love Halo...
05-09-2018T13:31:43,CrimsonQuill,It's why I keep requesting Spartan Raine week after week.
05-09-2018T13:37:29,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds What do you think is the likelihood of people voting for it?
05-09-2018T13:38:35,Twokinds,"I don't know, it seems like it might be a bit of a long shot."
05-09-2018T13:39:13,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds I've been trying it for three weeks...
05-09-2018T13:39:22,CrimsonQuill,None of my suggestions have made it yet.

05-09-2018T14:22:59,CrimsonQuill,I'd love that as a loading icon.
05-09-2018T14:23:07,CrimsonQuill,A lot cooler than what's normally there.

05-09-2018T15:55:53,CrimsonQuill,@tehbear I would like to see Raine sketched with Halo armour
05-09-2018T15:56:00,CrimsonQuill,Spartan Armour
05-09-2018T15:56:29,CrimsonQuill,@Bgrmystr2 I guessed it can't really share images-I left the link because it suited Spinning Kat.
05-09-2018T15:56:34,CrimsonQuill,Did you see it?
05-09-2018T15:56:52,tehbear,oh. so not a 300 reference.
05-09-2018T15:57:07,CrimsonQuill,@tehbear I haven't even seen that film.
05-09-2018T15:57:19,CrimsonQuill,"Nope, for me it's Halo."
05-09-2018T15:58:13,Bgrmystr2,"bear, I dunno how you saw 'spartan' without seeing 'halo considering the last point he said it, both were together lol"
05-09-2018T15:58:35,Bgrmystr2,xD woosh I guess
05-09-2018T15:59:05,CrimsonQuill,Guess what type she'd be-2/3/4
05-09-2018T15:59:22,Bgrmystr2,if it's not the armor from 1 I don't care :U
05-09-2018T15:59:37,CrimsonQuill,@Bgrmystr2 : (
05-09-2018T15:59:49,CrimsonQuill,I rather like Chief's armour in 3 and 4.
05-09-2018T15:59:55,CrimsonQuill,And the SPartan 4 armour
05-09-2018T16:00:00,CrimsonQuill,And the armour in Reach
05-09-2018T16:00:46,tehbear,"google image search for ""halo spartan"" just gives the mastercheif in white armour?"
05-09-2018T16:01:01,CrimsonQuill,Look up Spartan 3 or 4
05-09-2018T16:01:23,CrimsonQuill,"After all, even Spartan Locke describes Chief as 'THE Spartan',"
05-09-2018T16:03:47,CrimsonQuill,A cool image to me if ever.

05-09-2018T16:04:21,CrimsonQuill,I've been trying the suggestion 3 times in a row...I really hope it wins next stream.
05-09-2018T16:04:42,CrimsonQuill,@SpazztasticKiwi I love cats.
05-09-2018T16:04:56,Bgrmystr2,"you do realize people have gone suggesting things for 12+ months in a row without winning, right"
05-09-2018T16:05:05,Bgrmystr2,more than one person
05-09-2018T16:05:08,Bgrmystr2,and more than once.
05-09-2018T16:05:16,CrimsonQuill,@Bgrmystr2 Oh...I see...
05-09-2018T16:05:25,CrimsonQuill,I just really would like to see it...
05-09-2018T16:05:39,CrimsonQuill,Especially since I saw the Doomguy and Daisy sketch.
05-09-2018T16:05:57,Bgrmystr2,"if you really wanted to see it, your best bet would actually be to just go to a convention and have him sketch it there"
05-09-2018T16:06:07,Bgrmystr2,then pay for a nora card to get it colored if you like
05-09-2018T16:06:29,CrimsonQuill,I live in Europe. A flight to and fro would alone cost 600.
05-09-2018T16:06:44,CrimsonQuill,"Plus, I'm in University. I don't have the budget..."
05-09-2018T16:06:49,Bgrmystr2,suggesting it via patreon is basically picking a fight with the biggest fandoms that come to vote.
05-09-2018T16:07:02,CrimsonQuill,'Biggest fandoms?'
05-09-2018T16:07:06,Bgrmystr2,yeah
05-09-2018T16:07:14,tehbear,"yeah, I feel its a bit of a lost cause putting it up week after week considering tk is more medivil tech fantasy."
05-09-2018T16:07:15,CrimsonQuill,It got to number 6 first time I tried it...
05-09-2018T16:07:29,Bgrmystr2,"between the shippers, the ppl who want fanservice, and ppl who want something different entirelly"
05-09-2018T16:07:34,CrimsonQuill,And there has been Rebel Raine.
05-09-2018T16:07:43,CrimsonQuill,@Bgrmystr2 I see.
05-09-2018T16:07:44,tehbear,true. that was a good one
05-09-2018T16:07:45,Bgrmystr2,that was a tom pick lol
05-09-2018T16:07:54,Bgrmystr2,pretty sure so was doom guy
05-09-2018T16:07:59,CrimsonQuill,I just want to see coll sci fi stuff.
05-09-2018T16:08:07,CrimsonQuill,i know Doomguy was a Tom pick.
05-09-2018T16:08:11,CrimsonQuill,cool
05-09-2018T16:08:15,CrimsonQuill,damn typos
05-09-2018T16:09:01,CrimsonQuill,"Another idea I have is the two sides of Trace as a Jedi vs a Sith, a la Star Wars-as Snoke says in the Last Jedi, 'Darkness rises, and Light to meet it.'"
05-09-2018T16:14:06,tehbear,what about Jedi Trace vs Sith Trace?
05-09-2018T16:14:14,CrimsonQuill,That's what I said.
05-09-2018T16:14:21,CrimsonQuill,It's what I meant.
05-09-2018T16:14:35,tehbear,"ah, right. 2 sides."
05-09-2018T16:14:39,CrimsonQuill,Yes.
05-09-2018T16:14:49,CrimsonQuill,Light and Darkness.
05-09-2018T16:14:57,CrimsonQuill,Two sides to a coin.
05-09-2018T16:15:18,CrimsonQuill,But I'd like to see Spartan Raine first.
05-09-2018T16:15:31,tehbear,hm. Ewan McGregor vs the bald sith with the double bladed lightsabre staff comes to mind.
05-09-2018T16:16:04,KittyLoveless,Darth Maul?
05-09-2018T16:16:12,CrimsonQuill,That one.
05-09-2018T16:16:32,KittyLoveless,"look at that, and I'm not even a star wars fan üòÅ"
05-09-2018T16:16:57,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I find some parts of the fandom very wearing..."
05-09-2018T16:17:33,CrimsonQuill,I'm just in because I like the films-at least the originals and sequels...
05-09-2018T16:17:38,KittyLoveless,I don't even understand most of the suggestions people make
05-09-2018T16:17:52,CrimsonQuill,Neither do I sometimes...
05-09-2018T16:18:46,KittyLoveless,and it seems like my suggestions were just totally disconnected from what everyone else was suggesting that it discouraged me from making suggestions
05-09-2018T16:18:56,tehbear,"I rewatched Starwars 4,5,6,1,2,3 this spring and was surprised how good the first moves are."
05-09-2018T16:18:59,Bgrmystr2,they really aren'tt that difficult to understand
05-09-2018T16:19:08,KittyLoveless,to me they are
05-09-2018T16:19:48,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, what's to understand? Half the suggestions are ships. Half are fanservice, and half is just about anything else."
05-09-2018T16:20:28,tehbear,you mean 1/3 1/3 and 1/3 :)
05-09-2018T16:20:32,Bgrmystr2,no
05-09-2018T16:20:33,Bgrmystr2,I don't
05-09-2018T16:20:44,KittyLoveless,meh
05-09-2018T16:20:53,CrimsonQuill,@Brgmystr2 WHat sort of suggestions do you like to make?
05-09-2018T16:20:56,Bgrmystr2,cuz fanservice overlaps with ship and everything else
05-09-2018T16:21:06,Bgrmystr2,"I don't make any suggestions, I'm not a patron"
05-09-2018T16:21:10,CrimsonQuill,Ok
05-09-2018T16:21:18,CrimsonQuill,I only started in June
05-09-2018T16:21:29,CrimsonQuill,I only discovered the comic last December...
05-09-2018T16:21:40,Bgrmystr2,consider yourself lucky you can even afford to pay to be a patron in general :u
05-09-2018T16:21:52,CrimsonQuill,I suppose...
05-09-2018T16:22:19,CrimsonQuill,I just like both the Fischbach brother's stuff.
05-09-2018T16:22:49,CrimsonQuill,"Lately I have been reading a lot of webcomics-Mob Psycho 100, Hunters of Salamanstra, Replay..."
05-09-2018T16:23:14,CrimsonQuill,Anything that's a manga or manga style which also happens to have a good story is good to me.
05-09-2018T16:23:23,CrimsonQuill,I like good stories.
05-09-2018T16:24:01,CrimsonQuill,Mob Psycho 100 is really good. It's actually been made into an anime. It's authored by the creator of One Punch Man as his main project.
05-09-2018T16:24:08,tehbear,not heard of those. ive been reading The Whiteboard - not so much for the story but about the paintball geekyness and zombie apocolypse and general wackyness
05-09-2018T16:24:34,tehbear,and Freefall. What it lacks in art it makes up for in writing and humor.
05-09-2018T16:25:41,CrimsonQuill,I want to read Freefall. Very badly.
05-09-2018T16:25:48,tehbear,really enjoyed One Punch Man anime
05-09-2018T16:25:49,CrimsonQuill,I have so much on my to do list..
05-09-2018T16:30:44,Xexanoth,Mob Psycho got kinda meh in the end though

05-09-2018T19:30:46,SpazztasticKiwi,But if you want to risk infection or to lose the ability to taste steak again....
05-09-2018T19:31:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember I scraped the top of my mouth completely open once
05-09-2018T19:31:14,RimaDraws,i was thinking tongue piercing now that would hurt
05-09-2018T19:31:18,RimaDraws,ouch spazz

05-09-2018T19:32:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Chewing on a pencil
05-09-2018T19:32:16,SpazztasticKiwi,In the car
05-09-2018T19:32:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Hit a bump
05-09-2018T19:32:30,TheDixieNutjob,you had the sharp end in your mouth?
05-09-2018T19:32:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd chewed the eraser off. The metal bit was exposed

05-09-2018T19:33:56,RimaDraws,it makes me shudder
05-09-2018T19:34:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Main thing was the aftermath of containing the bleeding
05-09-2018T19:34:31,Bgrmystr2,"lol dixie, most of the time that kind of thing is done when you're young and don't know better :P"
05-09-2018T19:34:59,TheDixieNutjob,yeah but I never chewed pens or pencils
05-09-2018T19:35:03,RimaDraws,like the time i sucked on a gel pen ink tube to get it to work again and got ink in my mouth
05-09-2018T19:35:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Didn‚Äôt hurt to press a napkin on it or rinse it
05-09-2018T19:36:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"Nothing like a mouthful of blood, amIright"
05-09-2018T19:37:02,RimaDraws,ew i cant thnk of that
05-09-2018T19:37:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"And oddly enough, neither parent panicked. It was just ‚Äúoh, jeez. Gotta press something on it.‚Äù"
05-09-2018T19:38:02,RimaDraws,lol
05-09-2018T19:38:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôm also the second kid so, that might have something to do with it"
05-09-2018T19:38:39,RimaDraws,probably expected it after the first one
05-09-2018T19:38:45,RimaDraws,they always do
05-09-2018T19:39:05,SpazztasticKiwi,My sister cracked her head open on a coffee table young. They got their panics out
05-09-2018T19:39:15,RimaDraws,yea first child they always do
05-09-2018T19:39:18,RimaDraws,im the oldest of three
05-09-2018T19:41:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm youngest of two. Dad did ask if they wanted to try for a third but doctor had already told her she‚Äôd gotten too old to risk it
05-09-2018T19:43:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"I guess he wanted to try and get a son, like I‚Äôd supposed to been"
05-09-2018T19:43:33,Twokinds,I am oldest
05-09-2018T19:43:55,SpazztasticKiwi,By like 23 months
05-09-2018T19:45:14,SpazztasticKiwi,And the result of the 99% effectiveness of contraceptives
05-09-2018T19:45:26,Twokinds,Mark is middle child
05-09-2018T19:45:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Uh huh
05-09-2018T19:46:10,Bgrmystr2,"so who's the youngest, tom?"
05-09-2018T19:46:11,Twokinds,We don't talk about the third
05-09-2018T19:46:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Is that who this ‚ÄúJason‚Äù guy he goes on about is?
05-09-2018T19:46:16,Twokinds,He's in the attic
05-09-2018T19:46:22,Bgrmystr2,xDD mhm okay

05-09-2018T19:48:59,RimaDraws,being the oldest child kinda sucks
05-09-2018T19:52:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I imagine I wouldn‚Äôt be too happy as a middle child. Sister wouldn‚Äôt have been happy with two siblings
05-09-2018T19:53:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"Only reason I was planned was to try for a boy ‚Äúto get one of each‚Äù, and give her a sibling. They even asked her if she wanted a little brother or sister. I happened"
05-09-2018T19:54:50,RimaDraws,my sister (middle child) despised me still does in a way
05-09-2018T19:56:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Any reason why?
05-09-2018T19:57:26,RimaDraws,jealousy idk....she usually thought i was trying to steal her bf away when i was just being nice to them. plus she always thought she was the oldest one and couldnt get it out of her head she wasnt
05-09-2018T19:58:25,RimaDraws,to this day still acts like shes better than anyone in my family but technically just like my mother. wont start that soap box but still yea
05-09-2018T19:59:44,Ordithus,Our Mark is the evil Mark?
05-09-2018T19:59:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"That sounds like fun. My sisters more like my mom, though we have some similarities"
05-09-2018T20:00:24,SpazztasticKiwi,YouTube Mark is the crazy one. Calm Mark stays in the attic

05-09-2018T22:46:59,Dadrobit,"Got up to leave the theatre, and I turn around and see my brother in law and his husband waving at me from the back row."
05-09-2018T22:47:40,Dadrobit,Was very a very fortuitous occasion.
05-09-2018T22:49:39,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
05-09-2018T22:53:03,Dadrobit,"Thinking about buying the movie for home, it's one of those thrillers that you have to watch a few times to really catch everyhing I'm thinking."
05-09-2018T22:53:44,Dadrobit,That was a thinking sandwich. I am actually terrible at English.
