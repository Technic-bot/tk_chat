07-12-2018T00:04:58,Nekonny,have a good night everyone!
07-12-2018T00:05:15,totallynotTrace,for me naps give me more energy only if i wake up and its still light out
07-12-2018T00:05:27,totallynotTrace,bye Neko
07-12-2018T00:05:47,Corinthian,Whenever I take naps I get confused if it's the morning or the night.
07-12-2018T00:06:01,Corinthian,Though I rarely take naps.
07-12-2018T00:06:01,totallynotTrace,i know ive done that before
07-12-2018T00:06:02,Tharkis,G'nightRon !
07-12-2018T00:06:19,SageSaga,if im so tired i need to take a nap then im just gonna fall asleep if i try to nap- but if i try to go to sleep i will lay there for hours
07-12-2018T00:06:26,SageSaga,and not catch a single z
07-12-2018T00:06:51,totallynotTrace,if i wake up and its sunset or later forget being productive later that day
07-12-2018T00:07:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I know that feel Sage
07-12-2018T00:07:51,Nekonny,so what to do in those cases?
07-12-2018T00:07:56,Bgrmystr2,"that's why I don't nap at all, sage, it just ends up destroying your sleep schedule"
07-12-2018T00:08:04,SpazztasticKiwi,“I won’t take a nap so I’ll sleep even better cause I’ll actually be tired!”
07-12-2018T00:08:11,Bgrmystr2,"I just sleep once, and that's it"
07-12-2018T00:08:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Ron, watch crappy anime"
07-12-2018T00:08:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Bedtime arrives and it’s like you has alllll the coffee
07-12-2018T00:08:52,SageSaga,if you cant sleep... play smash?
07-12-2018T00:08:53,totallynotTrace,ever be so tired you cant sleep cuz you were forcing yourself to be awake way later than you should be?
07-12-2018T00:08:59,Nekonny,XD
07-12-2018T00:09:04,Nekonny,need a system for that
07-12-2018T00:09:24,ZRO4825,"I wanna play Smash, but I gotta wait till after Xmas ;_;"
07-12-2018T00:09:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"♪Everybody get up, Its time to smash now.♪"
07-12-2018T00:09:37,Bgrmystr2,"no I've never had that issue, nottrace. cuz every time I'm in that scenario, I just sleep immediately and don't wake up for 12-14 hours"
07-12-2018T00:09:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Crash team racing is rebooting for 2019
07-12-2018T00:09:57,Ordithus,I remember that game
07-12-2018T00:10:03,Ordithus,It was a fun game
07-12-2018T00:10:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Me too
07-12-2018T00:10:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m dying to see if Jack’ll play it
07-12-2018T00:10:36,SpazztasticKiwi,And who he’ll rope into joining since it’s online multiplayer
07-12-2018T00:20:30,totallynotTrace,so is chat frozen or has nobody said anything?
07-12-2018T00:20:43,totallynotTrace,that answers that
07-12-2018T00:20:46,Corinthian,Guess nobody's saying anything.

07-12-2018T00:26:12,Ordithus,It was at the top of my list if I ever were to acquire one

07-12-2018T00:26:17,totallynotTrace,'Night Tom!

07-12-2018T00:26:32,twentydollarcoffee,'night Tom!
07-12-2018T00:26:38,Bgrmystr2,Thanks for streaming tom
07-12-2018T00:26:44,Bgrmystr2,"great stuff today, lotta work done"
07-12-2018T00:27:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,And now we only have sage to watch over us.
07-12-2018T00:27:05,BadFoMo,"Good night. Also, I like the faces in panels 1 and 3."
07-12-2018T00:27:43,SpazztasticKiwi,At least I’m off Sunday. Ready to see how my suggestion fares :ptv-excited:
07-12-2018T00:28:12,BadFoMo,I still need to submit my request.
07-12-2018T00:28:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m good for a bit longer since I got 48 hours of free time now
07-12-2018T00:29:02,ZRO4825,"Toyoko, in the snow, in the Kirin outfit? O_O"
07-12-2018T00:29:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"But sweet dreams, no bed bugs, that jazz to ya Tom - and night"
07-12-2018T00:29:43,Mihari,You sure you want that ZRO because MHW will size down that chest!
07-12-2018T00:30:00,Bgrmystr2,"the game may, but sage may not"
07-12-2018T00:30:02,ZRO4825,But Toyoko is good at breaking things in a good way ;_;
07-12-2018T00:30:14,Bgrmystr2,thankfully sage is not the game :v
07-12-2018T00:30:17,ZRO4825,"Though you are correct, MHW is not the game for big titties. :joy:"
07-12-2018T00:30:24,Mihari,Sage lives and breaths the game tho.
07-12-2018T00:31:01,ZRO4825,"Iz quite possibly true. He's definitely got me beat at skill on it, for sure. I've gotten good at laying out the damage. I'm just not always great at avoiding it. :joy:"
07-12-2018T00:31:16,Bgrmystr2,"uhh.. I think he lives and breaths his comic, but I'm sure the game is somewhere in there too"
07-12-2018T00:31:21,ZRO4825,"And people on MHW discords are like ""Oh you don't need earplugs, just i-frame roll all the roars."""
07-12-2018T00:31:39,Ordithus,"Lookin' good, Sage.  I'm off to bed, goodnight!"
07-12-2018T00:31:49,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
07-12-2018T00:31:52,ZRO4825,"i-frames on roll are like, non-existant to me, lmao"
07-12-2018T00:31:52,BadFoMo,Good night.
07-12-2018T00:31:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Ord
07-12-2018T00:31:57,Bgrmystr2,"gnight ord, I thought you had stuff to do tomorrow / today"
07-12-2018T00:31:59,ZRO4825,G'night Ord! ^^/
07-12-2018T00:32:01,FoxxTrotter,"G'night, Ord."
07-12-2018T00:32:07,Mihari,"""Let me get my work done early so we can play a lot"""
07-12-2018T00:32:11,Mihari,I dunno...
07-12-2018T00:32:19,EggRollss,Night everyone
07-12-2018T00:32:26,FoxxTrotter,"G'night, Egg."
07-12-2018T00:32:26,BadFoMo,I think I may go back to bed now too.
07-12-2018T00:32:27,Bgrmystr2,work seems to come first tho lol
07-12-2018T00:32:44,Mihari,"If MHW paid the bills, I'm sure he'd switch gears quick XD"
07-12-2018T00:32:57,ZRO4825,"Well, I mean, to be fair, who wouldn't? :P"
07-12-2018T00:33:10,twentydollarcoffee,Imma head out as well. Thx for streaming Sage!
07-12-2018T00:33:20,Mihari,Not me XD
07-12-2018T00:33:24,Mihari,I can only take so much MH
07-12-2018T00:33:33,SageSaga,take care Twenty
07-12-2018T00:33:53,Bgrmystr2,"to be honest, it COULD"
07-12-2018T00:34:06,Bgrmystr2,just gotta get the viewing community for streaming the game
07-12-2018T00:34:24,Mihari,"Eh, I don't think Sage is the steamer type."
07-12-2018T00:34:47,ZRO4825,looks pointedly at what's going on...
07-12-2018T00:34:57,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering: you don't say
07-12-2018T00:35:00,Mihari,"Streaming artwork is one thing, streaming games is different"
07-12-2018T00:35:09,ZRO4825,"lol, true enough"
07-12-2018T00:35:19,Bgrmystr2,"I don't think they're very different at all, actually"
07-12-2018T00:35:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Especially if you choose to add a webcam/mic
07-12-2018T00:35:24,ZRO4825,"I stream my games, but I also stream JUST the games. I keep my mic muted from stream and no webcam."
07-12-2018T00:36:29,Mihari,I think it's far more likely for an introvert artist to succeed at streaming without doing much but general chat interaction. You have to be much more involved as a game streamer.
07-12-2018T00:36:39,ZRO4825,True that.
07-12-2018T00:37:18,SageSaga,yeah my attempts at being a game streamer failed so bad i dont even talk about it anymore and I just hope no one finds my old channel
07-12-2018T00:37:29,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, from watching quite a few game streams, I'd argue otherwise, but being involved with your viewers helps no matter what you do."
07-12-2018T00:38:14,Mihari,"Yes, is it possible to do nothing but stream the game and get a few followers, maybe some subs, but you'll never come close to the ones who actually are truely engaging."
07-12-2018T00:38:49,Bgrmystr2,"that applies to everything, though, not just games"
07-12-2018T00:39:00,Mihari,But we aren't talking about everything.
07-12-2018T00:39:32,Bgrmystr2,"you're just using a generalization and applying it to one, not to both. it applies to both."
07-12-2018T00:39:33,Bgrmystr2,:/
07-12-2018T00:40:26,Mihari,How?
07-12-2018T00:40:39,SageSaga,not seeing that at all Bgr
07-12-2018T00:41:03,Bgrmystr2,Because engaging the community as an art streamer is equally as it would for someone streaming games.
07-12-2018T00:41:24,Mihari,I never said it didn't.
07-12-2018T00:41:24,Bgrmystr2,equally as useful*
07-12-2018T00:41:54,Bgrmystr2,"you did, actually, you said game streamers had to be more involved, and I don't think that's the case at all."
07-12-2018T00:42:07,Mihari,It's absolutely true Sage and Tom's streams would be infinitely more entertaining if they talked and yapped to the chat some nights. But the conversation was about how things would be if Sage went from this stream to a gaming stream.
07-12-2018T00:42:33,SageSaga,there are different expectations from gaming to drawing
07-12-2018T00:43:17,SageSaga,there are very few super popular game streamers that are just really good at the games they play
07-12-2018T00:43:50,SageSaga,yet so long as i draw cool artwork then i can draw people even if my personality is super dry
07-12-2018T00:44:00,SageSaga,draw people in*
07-12-2018T00:44:10,Bgrmystr2,"I may have only been watching art streams for three years now, but it really isn't all that different based on every stream I've gone to."
07-12-2018T00:44:24,Bgrmystr2,maybe 3 1/2 I guess? July
07-12-2018T00:44:41,totallynotTrace,yeah when i watch an art stream i am there for the chill. If i want more excitement/engagement id watch somebody crash their horse into a tree in RDR2
07-12-2018T00:44:59,SageSaga,Your experience is very anecdotal
07-12-2018T00:45:11,Bgrmystr2,"maybe, but what experience isnt'?"
07-12-2018T00:45:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"Watching the gamers stream that I do and then watching you two, there’s a difference but it boils down to balancing interaction with chat/fans and the actual wotk"
07-12-2018T00:45:54,SageSaga,"probably the stats ive seen for streamers and thought ""Wow i cant do the gaming thing with this kinda requirements"""
07-12-2018T00:45:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Whether that work be drawing or gameplay
07-12-2018T00:47:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though with game streamers, they have to balance interactivity with gameplay in that gameplay isn’t passive with most games. Like RDR2, the game has moving parts and reactions whether you’re paying attention or not"
07-12-2018T00:48:03,SageSaga,im saying that the work of an artist in an art stream is more important than the quality of a game in a game stream
07-12-2018T00:48:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah
07-12-2018T00:48:44,SpazztasticKiwi,You gotta focus on what you’re doing so nothing goes out of line
07-12-2018T00:48:54,SageSaga,if my art is total garbage i would have to be a really special personality to make the stream entertaining and only be about drawing
07-12-2018T00:49:40,Bgrmystr2,And gaming is the same. There are people who suck at all the games they play
07-12-2018T00:49:40,SageSaga,"meanwhile a good streamer with a good personality can make a terrible game fun to watch, while a dull personality person can make an awesome game terrible to watch"
07-12-2018T00:49:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"Well it’s a good thing it’s not garbage, huh"
07-12-2018T00:49:51,SageSaga,i hope...
07-12-2018T00:49:57,SpazztasticKiwi,And you do a good job in chatting with us too!
07-12-2018T00:51:26,Bgrmystr2,I really don't see how that's any different from drawing though. A good artist can rely on good art rather than personality just as much as they can rely on personality rather than quality art
07-12-2018T00:52:45,SageSaga,a good streamer cant rely on the game
07-12-2018T00:52:52,SageSaga,good game* streamer
07-12-2018T00:53:13,SageSaga,that's the difference
07-12-2018T00:53:24,Bgrmystr2,but good gameplay can be
07-12-2018T00:55:31,SageSaga,it really doesnt- you have to be a special kind of amazing player and even those lose people very fast
07-12-2018T00:56:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh that reminds me of how my lettering is when I’m doing fancy writing
07-12-2018T00:56:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"“Undo, redo, undo, redo, and repeat”"
07-12-2018T00:57:29,Bgrmystr2,looks sorta like Hdiday to me xD
07-12-2018T00:57:33,JamesBSquirrel3,NICE!:ptv-excited:
07-12-2018T00:57:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Merry Christmas Everybody
07-12-2018T00:58:02,Bgrmystr2,lolol marv
07-12-2018T00:58:25,FoxxTrotter,Pinhead: NOT QUITE.
07-12-2018T00:58:38,Bgrmystr2,"aw the text was fine though sage, the o was just a bit close"
07-12-2018T00:58:41,ZRO4825,"My writing only comes in two forms. Normal, and Almost Legible."
07-12-2018T00:58:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Mine is often tiny
07-12-2018T00:58:58,SageSaga,My handwriting isnt very good
07-12-2018T00:59:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Looks ok to me
07-12-2018T00:59:09,Bgrmystr2,"Mine also comes in two flavors, zro. Scribble, and jibberish."
07-12-2018T00:59:09,SpazztasticKiwi,At least it’s readable
07-12-2018T00:59:12,SageSaga,this is not my handwriting
07-12-2018T00:59:35,JamesBSquirrel3,OK definetly better this time! :D
07-12-2018T00:59:41,SpazztasticKiwi,It can’t be THAT bad
07-12-2018T01:01:24,Bgrmystr2,lol I would have commented if sage wrote anything but the stream froze
07-12-2018T01:02:13,Bgrmystr2,this looks nice sage
07-12-2018T01:02:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Animations still goin. Think he just walked off for a bit
07-12-2018T01:02:30,Bgrmystr2,maybe for you
07-12-2018T01:02:31,Bgrmystr2,not for me
07-12-2018T01:02:34,Bgrmystr2,both stopped
07-12-2018T01:02:42,ZRO4825,"Stream still going just fine, fix yer shit, Bgr :P"
07-12-2018T01:02:53,Bgrmystr2,no
07-12-2018T01:02:57,Bgrmystr2,I'm not restarting till sage finishes.
07-12-2018T01:03:01,Bgrmystr2,:U
07-12-2018T01:03:13,SpazztasticKiwi,He back
07-12-2018T01:03:24,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all. Back again for a bit.
07-12-2018T01:03:28,Bgrmystr2,wb
07-12-2018T01:03:33,FoxxTrotter,WB Dadrobit.
07-12-2018T01:03:34,Dadrobit,Seems Tom finished?
07-12-2018T01:03:40,Bgrmystr2,yeah he went to bed
07-12-2018T01:03:40,Dadrobit,And Ron.
07-12-2018T01:03:41,FoxxTrotter,Yes.
07-12-2018T01:03:42,ZRO4825,"Wb Dadro, and yeah"
07-12-2018T01:03:44,Bgrmystr2,ron too
07-12-2018T01:03:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Wb Dad
07-12-2018T01:03:57,Bgrmystr2,they all went to sleep
07-12-2018T01:04:15,Dadrobit,"Ah, and missed a stream topic it seems."
07-12-2018T01:04:26,Bgrmystr2,you did
07-12-2018T01:04:46,Bgrmystr2,Good time for me to brb as well :thinking:
07-12-2018T01:04:49,Dadrobit,I only ever really stream when none of my regular buddies are around.
07-12-2018T01:05:01,Dadrobit,"Which is to say, very rarely."
07-12-2018T01:05:32,ZRO4825,"I stream my games almost any time I'm playing, but, well, I don't talk on mic since I'm on Discord with someone like 90% of the time. And I don't webcam, and I have a hard time engaging the chat since I only got one monitor, sooo...yeah, lol"
07-12-2018T01:05:33,Dadrobit,"But it's fun to have a dozen or so random folks pop in and chat, gotta say."
07-12-2018T01:06:01,Dadrobit,"No webcam, but I'm definitely always mic'd up."
07-12-2018T01:06:15,Dadrobit,Gotta work the angles that I can.
07-12-2018T01:06:34,SageSaga,NOOOOOOOOOOOO
07-12-2018T01:06:39,Dadrobit,Yep
07-12-2018T01:06:43,Dadrobit,Lost the art?
07-12-2018T01:06:49,SageSaga,worse
07-12-2018T01:06:57,Dadrobit,Lost a kidney?
07-12-2018T01:07:08,SageSaga,worse...
07-12-2018T01:07:15,Dadrobit,Lost.... Two kidneys?
07-12-2018T01:07:24,Dadrobit,Throw me a bone
07-12-2018T01:07:24,SageSaga,little less worse
07-12-2018T01:07:39,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: I come back to something bad happen
07-12-2018T01:07:40,SageSaga,i gotta draw another building
07-12-2018T01:07:45,Bgrmystr2,oh
07-12-2018T01:07:48,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
07-12-2018T01:07:52,Bgrmystr2,oh noes.
07-12-2018T01:08:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Would you rather draw a building or watch The monster hunter live action movie, Sage"
07-12-2018T01:08:10,Bgrmystr2,how will you survive.
07-12-2018T01:08:15,Dadrobit,"One day, I'm gonna commision you Sage, and it's just gonna be a request for a bunch of scantily clad buildings."
07-12-2018T01:08:22,ZRO4825,lmfao
07-12-2018T01:08:27,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-ohmy:
07-12-2018T01:08:53,ZRO4825,":thinking: I am about due for another FF commision...gotta wait till after Xmas though, silly new PC build ate my back-up funds."
07-12-2018T01:09:11,Bgrmystr2,"Dadro, architecture porn? or cityscape porn? :ptv-ohmy::ptv-ohmy:"
07-12-2018T01:09:27,Dadrobit,Architecture of course.
07-12-2018T01:09:38,Bgrmystr2,both are acceptable
07-12-2018T01:09:41,Bgrmystr2,just curious
07-12-2018T01:09:42,Dadrobit,Get those minute details in there.
07-12-2018T01:10:02,Dadrobit,"And yeah, my bank account isn't looking great at the moment."
07-12-2018T01:10:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m gonna go on
07-12-2018T01:10:04,Bgrmystr2,You can do details in the latter too
07-12-2018T01:10:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Till tomorrow 👋🏻
07-12-2018T01:10:23,FoxxTrotter,"G'night, Kiwi."
07-12-2018T01:10:28,Bgrmystr2,"Go on, take the money and run~"
07-12-2018T01:10:29,Dadrobit,Only time it actually looked any good was that time I got a bank error in my favor IRL.
07-12-2018T01:10:30,Bgrmystr2,I mean
07-12-2018T01:10:32,Bgrmystr2,gnight kiwi
07-12-2018T01:10:39,Dadrobit,o/ Spazz
07-12-2018T01:10:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"Good goin, Sage 👍🏻"
07-12-2018T01:10:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Night everyone
07-12-2018T01:10:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,See ya Kiwi
07-12-2018T01:11:03,Dadrobit,"Someone fucked up their deposit, and I wound up with an extra 100k in y checking."
07-12-2018T01:11:07,Dadrobit,my*
07-12-2018T01:11:12,Dadrobit,Made for a good picture.
07-12-2018T01:11:38,ZRO4825,lol
07-12-2018T01:12:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"And night to you, Sage - keep ‘er up!"
07-12-2018T01:14:07,SageSaga,take care!
07-12-2018T01:14:16,Dadrobit,"Found it! $124,955.18 in checking. I. Fucking. Wish."
07-12-2018T01:14:48,Dadrobit,That'd be a helluva down-payment on a house.
07-12-2018T01:15:03,ZRO4825,"Downpayment? Shit, that'd BUY a decent house for me, lmao"
07-12-2018T01:15:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Same
07-12-2018T01:15:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,the house and like 20 acres
07-12-2018T01:15:51,ZRO4825,"Yup, lol"
07-12-2018T01:16:04,Dadrobit,"Nah, maybe 2/3 acre with a small-ish house around here."
07-12-2018T01:16:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,You should move
07-12-2018T01:16:41,Bgrmystr2,that would have bought almost 3/4 of the house I'm in right now
07-12-2018T01:16:45,Bgrmystr2,god damn
07-12-2018T01:17:14,SageSaga,wish things were that cheap around here
07-12-2018T01:17:38,Dadrobit,"Eh, checking Zillo, could get a 3bed 2bath house."
07-12-2018T01:18:07,Dadrobit,"So still a decent house, but not super fancy or in a fashion that I'm aiming for."
07-12-2018T01:18:36,SageSaga,housing markets are very different even area to area in the same state much less state to state
07-12-2018T01:19:44,Dadrobit,"Yeah, 20 minutes north in Scottsdale and houses are going in the tens of millions."
07-12-2018T01:20:04,Bgrmystr2,that's pretty nutso
07-12-2018T01:20:06,FoxxTrotter,A lot like that in the RDU area as well.
07-12-2018T01:20:14,FoxxTrotter,Especially in Cary.
07-12-2018T01:21:07,Dadrobit,That was the area I used to work security for. They paid very well needless to say.
07-12-2018T01:21:08,Bgrmystr2,somewhere relatively nearby there's a subdivision called English Turn which has HUGE 2-3 story houses and massive yards all for millions.. and where I lived in GA was the same houses for half a mil..
07-12-2018T01:21:32,Bgrmystr2,that kinda difference just makes me feel bad for the quality of the area.
07-12-2018T01:22:48,SageSaga,"there are areas where i live where you couldnt buy a house for less than 2 million, meanwhile 2 miles away you can get a shack of a home for under a hundred thousand"
07-12-2018T01:23:07,FoxxTrotter,Same here.
07-12-2018T01:23:14,SageSaga,to make that shack livable you are going to spend well over 100k though
07-12-2018T01:23:33,Dadrobit,Sounds about right.
07-12-2018T01:24:44,Dadrobit,"I remember there was this ad that went around as a meme not so long ago where the realtor listed a ""fixer-upper"" for 100k+ and used super old photos to sell it."
07-12-2018T01:25:13,Dadrobit,But someone went on Google Map Streetview and found it was a burnt out husk with graffiti and a tarp covering the caved in roof.
07-12-2018T01:25:43,Dadrobit,"Like, good lord, the poor bastard house flipper that buys that sight unseen."
07-12-2018T01:30:42,Bgrmystr2,lol..
07-12-2018T01:30:46,FoxxTrotter,"I'm off to bed. G'night, everyone. :0)"
07-12-2018T01:31:13,Bgrmystr2,"if by ""fixer upper"" you mean ""trash the whole property and build a house from scratch"""
07-12-2018T01:31:35,Bgrmystr2,gnight foxx
07-12-2018T01:31:43,SageSaga,gnight Foxx
07-12-2018T01:33:23,Dadrobit,o/ Foxx
07-12-2018T01:34:20,Dadrobit,"And yeah. Plus it was labeled as ""pleasant neighborhood."" Really, it was just ""Hood""."
07-12-2018T01:35:36,Bgrmystr2,xD
07-12-2018T01:35:59,Bgrmystr2,Was it a real ad though? Cuz that sounds like some false advertising territory imo
07-12-2018T01:37:10,Dadrobit,"I mean, probably? Fuck if I know though. Do you really think someone would just go out and lie on the internet like that?"
07-12-2018T01:37:32,SageSaga,it's probably one of those fake for fun stories
07-12-2018T01:37:39,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: no impossible noone lies on the internet
07-12-2018T01:37:46,Bgrmystr2,it's the internet!
07-12-2018T01:38:00,SageSaga,"""Dear internet, I cant believe this happened to me!-"""
07-12-2018T01:38:20,Bgrmystr2,"""Why did this happen to meeeeeee~"" :musical_note::notes:"
07-12-2018T01:38:33,Dadrobit,Pictures looked legit. And the poster linked the location so viewers could check it out for themselves. But who knows with the internet.
07-12-2018T01:39:09,Bgrmystr2,"irony, considering the internet let's you cross-reference and look at multiple sources"
07-12-2018T01:39:20,Bgrmystr2,can't really be said elsewhere..
07-12-2018T01:39:26,SageSaga,people have to do that though
07-12-2018T01:39:45,Bgrmystr2,lets* why am I adding apostrophes randomly Dx
07-12-2018T01:39:58,Dadrobit,I do that con'stantly.
07-12-2018T01:40:27,Bgrmystr2,lol sure thank's that makes me feel better :ptv-unimpressed:
07-12-2018T01:41:02,ZRO4825,More like just desserts for anyone who buys a house without seeing the damned thing first imo. :P
07-12-2018T01:41:33,Dadrobit,"Oh, just checked out Neon's upload. The Rumble song. Someone should probably tell him that ""Let's Get Ready To Rumble"" is very fucking trademarked."
07-12-2018T01:41:58,Bgrmystr2,"noone deserves to be scammed, but that's just.. that house is just a level too far"
07-12-2018T01:42:09,Dadrobit,Dunno ZRO. Might affect someone who's moving to a new area in a hurry due to a career opportunity?
07-12-2018T01:42:33,ZRO4825,"I'd take a week or two living in a hotel to make sure I see a property before I buy it, personally. :x"
07-12-2018T01:42:38,ZRO4825,"And I HATE hotels, lol"
07-12-2018T01:43:18,Bgrmystr2,you would leave your property before finding and confirming you want to buy the new place....?
07-12-2018T01:43:36,Bgrmystr2,seems not that great of an idea
07-12-2018T01:46:56,Dadrobit,"If you get a job in an industry across the country, you may find some people would take the risk on something like that."
07-12-2018T01:48:14,Dadrobit,"""Fixer-upper"" with good looking pictures for an affordable price might catch someone unawares."
07-12-2018T01:48:53,Dadrobit,"Granted, a case like the one I listed could easily be turned into a legal battle, but I'm sure similar but slightly less extreme cases happen often enough."
07-12-2018T01:50:04,Dadrobit,"Used car companies are notorious for selling cars and trucks with ""Some Water Damage"" after they're wrecked by a flood."
07-12-2018T01:50:30,Dadrobit,"Touch up some paint, make sure it turns over, and flip it asap."
07-12-2018T01:51:13,Dadrobit,All the while the frame and various unseen parts will be rusting to all hell.
07-12-2018T01:52:06,Bgrmystr2,"yeh, sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen xD"
07-12-2018T01:52:09,Bgrmystr2,if it hadn't already
07-12-2018T01:54:14,Dadrobit,I'm sure some have.
07-12-2018T01:54:32,Dadrobit,It was a big thing again after Texas got hit with massive flooding.
07-12-2018T01:56:26,Dadrobit,"Dealerships will pull in a bunch of vehicles at salvage auctions, get them functional enough to get the DMV to re-title it, and then sell it for mad profit."
07-12-2018T01:57:08,Dadrobit,You can buy newer cars at salvage auctions for under a grand if you're in the right place at the right time.
07-12-2018T01:57:37,Dadrobit,"So it's nothing for them to spend a few grand on making it ""like new"" and then flipping it for 10k."
07-12-2018T01:58:24,Dadrobit,"Had a buddy in security who did that as his side gig, always tried to convince me to go into it with him."
07-12-2018T01:58:30,Bgrmystr2,"on the inside, I bet they're close to dead though"
07-12-2018T01:58:32,Bgrmystr2,the cars
07-12-2018T01:58:45,Dadrobit,It depends.
07-12-2018T01:59:03,Dadrobit,Was it underwater for half a day? Or for half a week?
07-12-2018T01:59:32,Dadrobit,You might just end up with moldy smelling carpets.
07-12-2018T01:59:49,Bgrmystr2,wouldn't it have rust either way? Just moreso on the latter
07-12-2018T01:59:50,Dadrobit,Or you might end up with major electrical issues.
07-12-2018T02:00:26,ZRO4825,And people wonder why I say to never trust a used car dealership :joy:
07-12-2018T02:01:58,Dadrobit,"It really depends on the vehicle. It might be just a minor amount that barely affects it in the long term, or you might literally have a half-rusted out iol-pan."
07-12-2018T02:02:23,Dadrobit,oil*
07-12-2018T02:03:13,Bgrmystr2,don't they have forums and sites dedicated to some cars where you can find people that would give better prices anyway?
07-12-2018T02:03:24,Bgrmystr2,like the ones for classic cars and shit
07-12-2018T02:05:38,Dadrobit,"Sure, for folks that are deeply invested in getting a solid deal. Maybe not for the soccer mom who just wants a bigger van to carry her newest charge and the dealership down the road has ~Just~ the thing?"
07-12-2018T02:07:21,Bgrmystr2,"loll yes I bet they do have just the thing, cheap vehicle they make a pretty penny on cuz they oversell the little things that don't change the value much :V"
07-12-2018T02:07:48,Bgrmystr2,"One too many car dealerships down here.. scum as all hell, a lot of em"
07-12-2018T02:11:59,Dadrobit,Watching a mini-documentary on it now. Following a Hurricane Sandy truck that was under water for two days. Auctioned for 4k. Sold for 20k.
07-12-2018T02:12:28,Bgrmystr2,jesus
07-12-2018T02:12:35,Bgrmystr2,Feels bad..
07-12-2018T02:12:43,Bgrmystr2,whoever bought that got the short end of the stuck
07-12-2018T02:12:46,Bgrmystr2,..stick* even
07-12-2018T02:12:56,Bgrmystr2,Stuck stick.
07-12-2018T02:12:58,Dadrobit,ABC News.
07-12-2018T02:13:15,Bgrmystr2,ew really why would they want it
07-12-2018T02:13:37,Dadrobit,"They went in knowing what it was to go after USAA, the insurance company that didn't properly brand the title as a Flood Salvage."
07-12-2018T02:13:52,Dadrobit,It was an expose on that.
07-12-2018T02:14:16,Bgrmystr2,oooOOOOooh
07-12-2018T02:14:36,Bgrmystr2,yeah that works
07-12-2018T02:15:36,Dadrobit,"It was marked as salvage, and that it went through a flood. But it wasn't properly done. When they went to the used car lot the salesman said that the CarFax statement about it going through a flood was ""a glitch""."
07-12-2018T02:16:00,ZRO4825,<_<;;;
07-12-2018T02:16:02,Bgrmystr2,uh..
07-12-2018T02:16:20,Bgrmystr2,yeah lying like that can get you big trouble lol
07-12-2018T02:17:05,Dadrobit,They bought it with the old owner. He opened up the glovebox and found some of his old tools. All rusted up.

07-12-2018T02:33:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,go bob ross with it?
07-12-2018T02:33:59,Bgrmystr2,"or, failing that, tom ross"
07-12-2018T02:34:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"or do what I do and just say ""Screw it, Moving one to something else."""

07-12-2018T02:38:07,ZRO4825,Obvious solution is to go run laps in a Lamborghini. Solves problems.

07-12-2018T02:41:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,That man is a meme
07-12-2018T02:42:41,SageSaga,well ive confirmed i did the perspective ruler wrong but that doesnt stop the house from also just being wrong
07-12-2018T02:48:31,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-uneasy: .. yeah some of the angles are kinda questionable
07-12-2018T02:50:39,SageSaga,right now im just checking to see how warped this 3rd point is making it
07-12-2018T02:55:11,SageSaga,so one of these points is really throwing it off
07-12-2018T03:03:06,SageSaga,well-
07-12-2018T03:03:20,DarthRexKing,Goodnight.
07-12-2018T03:03:22,SageSaga,its messy but i can kinda see it

07-12-2018T03:21:18,SageSaga,morning
07-12-2018T03:21:43,CrimsonQuill,Just had porridge. And three cups of tea.

07-12-2018T03:22:17,SageSaga,3:22am here
07-12-2018T03:22:54,CrimsonQuill,"WOAH. Well, you'd better have one heck of a lie in after you're done with your drawing."
07-12-2018T03:23:15,SageSaga,not done yet
07-12-2018T03:23:35,CrimsonQuill,That's evident.
07-12-2018T03:23:52,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I'm finally going to start Artificial incident."
07-12-2018T03:24:00,SageSaga,hope you like it
07-12-2018T03:24:03,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-ohmy::ptv-excited: oh that's lookin nice, sage"
07-12-2018T03:24:08,CrimsonQuill,I'm sure I will.

07-12-2018T04:09:06,CrimsonQuill,I'm just here for the chat-I'm afraid of spoilers for comics

07-12-2018T04:10:15,Bgrmystr2,are you gonna leave it like that for tonight? or work more on it?
07-12-2018T04:10:25,SageSaga,coloring tomorrow
07-12-2018T04:10:31,Bgrmystr2,okay
07-12-2018T04:10:34,SageSaga,might even take some time Monday to finish it up
07-12-2018T04:10:46,Bgrmystr2,:o

07-12-2018T09:49:15,Dadrobit,"Holy crap, I think I woke up in Silent Hill. Fog so thick I literally cannot see two houses down."
07-12-2018T09:50:04,Dadrobit,This guy is not going out to buy groceries this morning like he planned.
07-12-2018T09:50:32,CrimsonQuill,I should think not-fog as thick as you're saying it is would lead to catastrophe.
07-12-2018T09:51:22,Dadrobit,"I legit walked outside my door intending to go pick up some produce, and just walked into a wall of white."
07-12-2018T09:51:30,Dadrobit,Turned around and went back inside.

07-12-2018T09:52:22,Dadrobit,Screw driving in that when the state is inundated with old retired people who don't know how to drive in perfectly clear weather.

07-12-2018T09:53:41,Twokinds,Gotta get going this morning
07-12-2018T09:53:44,Twokinds,I'll be back later
07-12-2018T09:53:47,CrimsonQuill,Okay
07-12-2018T09:53:54,CrimsonQuill,I'll be making my Arcmap
07-12-2018T09:54:06,Twokinds,Gotta renew my PO BOX at the post office
07-12-2018T09:54:10,CrimsonQuill,On dive sites in a coastal village 200 miles from me
07-12-2018T09:54:24,CrimsonQuill,Take care!
07-12-2018T09:54:52,Dadrobit,"Good luck, hopefully there are no hangups and/or absurdly long lines!"
07-12-2018T09:59:29,CrimsonQuill,"Just how bad is the fog, Dadrobit?"
07-12-2018T10:03:19,Dadrobit,I can make out generalities of the second house down standing in front of my own. The third is totally obfuscated.
07-12-2018T10:03:42,CrimsonQuill,Has a cloud decided to pay the ground a visit?
07-12-2018T10:03:55,CrimsonQuill,Maybe it thought it was lonely.
07-12-2018T10:04:17,CrimsonQuill,Because that is the only explaination I can think of for that sort of fog.
07-12-2018T10:10:01,MrMongMong,Fog is a cloud's way of telling the world that it loves us.
07-12-2018T10:10:05,Dadrobit,Dunno. 'Specially since I'm in the middle of the desert. It has been wet these last few days though.
07-12-2018T10:10:13,MrMongMong,"It's like a hug, but from the sky."
07-12-2018T10:10:49,MrMongMong,SkyXGround is now canon.
07-12-2018T10:11:01,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, I didn't know you were in a desert Dadrobit."
07-12-2018T10:11:23,CrimsonQuill,@MrMongMong I always think of it as cloud hugging the ground too.
07-12-2018T10:11:41,MrMongMong,Let's write a story around it.
07-12-2018T10:12:03,CrimsonQuill,"Sorry, I'm already writing a story."
07-12-2018T10:12:07,MrMongMong,Aw...
07-12-2018T10:12:19,MrMongMong,Good luck.
07-12-2018T10:12:20,CrimsonQuill,About what happens when you put three Daleks on the USS Enterprise.
07-12-2018T10:13:51,MrMongMong,Oh no.
07-12-2018T10:14:39,CrimsonQuill,"I haven't decided whether everyone will die, or whether only NEARLY everyone will die yet."
07-12-2018T10:14:44,CrimsonQuill,But I'm close...
07-12-2018T10:15:01,CrimsonQuill,It's only the first draft though.
07-12-2018T10:17:38,MrMongMong,Have nearly everyone die. Except for the daleks. Dun dun DUUUN!!!
07-12-2018T10:18:12,CrimsonQuill,'EXTERMINATE! EXTERMINATE! EXTERMINATE!'
07-12-2018T10:18:32,MrMongMong,YOU WILL BE LIKE U- *Cyberman dies randomly*
07-12-2018T10:20:43,CrimsonQuill,Cybermen: TOGETHER. CYBERMEN PLUS DALEKS. WE WILL UPGRADE THE UNIVERSE.
07-12-2018T10:20:55,CrimsonQuill,Dalek: YOU PROPOSE AN ALLIANCE.
07-12-2018T10:21:04,CrimsonQuill,Cyberman: THIS IS CORRECT.
07-12-2018T10:21:08,MrMongMong,YOU ARE ONLY SUPERIOR IN ONE ASPECT.
07-12-2018T10:21:11,CrimsonQuill,Dalek: REQUEST DENIED!
07-12-2018T10:21:25,CrimsonQuill,@MrMongMong YOU ARE BETTER AT DYING!
07-12-2018T10:21:30,MrMongMong,YOU ARE BETTER AT DYING! YES!
07-12-2018T10:21:44,CrimsonQuill,Cyberleader: DALEKS BE WARNED. YOU HAVE DECLARED WAR UPON THE CYBERMEN.
07-12-2018T10:21:50,MrMongMong,The daleks are savage
07-12-2018T10:21:57,CrimsonQuill,Dalek Sec: THIS IS NOT WAR! THIS IS PEST CONTROL!
07-12-2018T10:23:04,CrimsonQuill,"I want to make the daleks in my story as scary as the Dalek from 'Dalek', and the cult of Skaro in Doomsday."
07-12-2018T10:23:12,MrMongMong,hahaha
07-12-2018T10:23:50,CrimsonQuill,How'd you think a Dalek would fare against First Order Stormtroopers?
07-12-2018T10:24:13,MrMongMong,Daleks would become the new Stormtroopers.
07-12-2018T10:24:24,MrMongMong,They even miss the main character enough.
07-12-2018T10:24:25,CrimsonQuill,I think that too.
07-12-2018T10:24:46,CrimsonQuill,But they'd actually (gasp) HIT main characters in my thing!
07-12-2018T10:25:08,CrimsonQuill,The villains (shock and horror) would actually be halfway COMPETENT!
07-12-2018T10:25:23,CrimsonQuill,"Hah, I won't make my protaganists immune to misfortune..."
07-12-2018T10:25:24,MrMongMong,Hm... It would be quite interesting to see how the story would progress from there.
07-12-2018T10:26:07,CrimsonQuill,"My best friend says the problem with main villains is that if they actually become competent, then they'll win forever, and that's the end of the show/film series."
07-12-2018T10:26:19,CrimsonQuill,Because villains only need to win once...
07-12-2018T10:26:30,CrimsonQuill,At least in Hollywood and BBC.
07-12-2018T10:27:33,MrMongMong,"That's not true. More heroes will rise, and they will face the same problem as a hero, with minor opponents constantly rising up. It actually may make for a very interesting plot. How would a villain maintain their rule?"
07-12-2018T10:28:05,CrimsonQuill,The problem with the Daleks is they don't want to rule the galaxy's population.
07-12-2018T10:28:12,MrMongMong,They just want to kill.
07-12-2018T10:28:12,CrimsonQuill,They want to exterminate it outright.
07-12-2018T10:28:22,CrimsonQuill,Which means no one to rise against them.
07-12-2018T10:28:24,MrMongMong,What if they run into immortals?
07-12-2018T10:28:30,MrMongMong,Like Me?
07-12-2018T10:28:35,MrMongMong,Or Jack?
07-12-2018T10:28:39,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, in time they'll find a way to kill them too."
07-12-2018T10:29:02,CrimsonQuill,"Bear in mind the Time Lords used EVERY FORBIDDEN WEAPON except the moment, and the Daleks just kept on coming."
07-12-2018T10:29:23,MrMongMong,"If there are only three, they might find a way to immobilize them?"
07-12-2018T10:29:33,CrimsonQuill,"And they forced the Time Lords-in the Whoniverse, the equivilents to gods-to fight on their own terms."
07-12-2018T10:29:45,MrMongMong,That is true...
07-12-2018T10:30:00,CrimsonQuill,"Plus, I plan one dalek to blow up on the Star Trek Starship from a dozen VERY overcharged phaser rifles."
07-12-2018T10:30:07,MrMongMong,Ooh.
07-12-2018T10:30:11,CrimsonQuill,But these overcharged blasts will drain the battery.
07-12-2018T10:30:28,CrimsonQuill,And half the rifles will blow up in the wielder's faces from overloading.
07-12-2018T10:30:48,MrMongMong,Hmmm.
07-12-2018T10:31:13,MrMongMong,They could in theory blow up their ship... But that would cut off the story too soon.
07-12-2018T10:31:31,CrimsonQuill,I've already cut that oppurtunity off.
07-12-2018T10:31:38,CrimsonQuill,The Daleks can hack anything.
07-12-2018T10:31:46,MrMongMong,Uh oh.
07-12-2018T10:31:48,CrimsonQuill,So they've already disabled the self-destruct.
07-12-2018T10:32:01,CrimsonQuill,And they're going to disable Saucer Seperation too.
07-12-2018T10:32:07,MrMongMong,That sounds like a pretty well thought-out story. :)
07-12-2018T10:32:17,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I plan for the Daleks to win this one."
07-12-2018T10:32:23,CrimsonQuill,I might have one or two survivors.
07-12-2018T10:33:28,MrMongMong,Farewell CrimsonQuill.

07-12-2018T13:10:40,Tharkis,half the fun of decorating the tree is re-decorating half way through when the cat knocks all the ornaments off :ctharkis-earwiggle:
07-12-2018T13:11:43,Twokinds,We got a small one this year

07-12-2018T13:17:56,Bgrmystr2,cuz you can see it on her face and her hair above and around it.

07-12-2018T13:19:31,Twokinds,yeah newest update

07-12-2018T13:21:09,Tharkis,"sometimes i think i should have gone into drawing instead of blacksmithing, swordsmithing, and now picking up leatherwork and bronze casting to accompany the bladesmithing =D"
07-12-2018T13:21:21,Tharkis,i think about how much space in my house i'd save by not having workshop and tools everywhere
07-12-2018T13:21:32,Ordithus,"But then you wouldn't have all that, Tharkis"
07-12-2018T13:21:33,Tharkis,but i love my hobbies =)

07-12-2018T13:26:27,Ordithus,This door would make a spider blush
07-12-2018T13:26:33,MrMongMong,Or maybe a collection of painting made by Eric.

07-12-2018T14:23:45,TerraTheWizard,"but it always gets at me that that it's not red, lol :ctwokinds-keith8D:"
07-12-2018T14:23:55,RimaDraws,then he would be like crimson quill
07-12-2018T14:23:56,FoxxTrotter,:cfoxxtrotter-SlyJoy: Ey'dere.
07-12-2018T14:24:00,BadFoMo,Yo.
07-12-2018T14:24:01,RimaDraws,i would get the two mixed up
07-12-2018T14:24:11,CatzArt,Sup Trotter
07-12-2018T14:24:14,TerraTheWizard,too many crimsons :ctwokinds-flomad:
07-12-2018T14:24:16,Aphala,"So true, TES Arena was an utter mess for traps"
07-12-2018T14:24:40,RimaDraws,crimsonhelsing is also my streamer mod
07-12-2018T14:24:41,CatzArt,I never played arena. Oblivion was my first TES game.
07-12-2018T14:24:47,BadFoMo,Same.
07-12-2018T14:24:53,Aphala,Oblivion <3 Always will be better than Morrowind for me
07-12-2018T14:25:14,Aphala,Everyone was made of plastic or looked like a melted stretch armstrong
07-12-2018T14:25:28,TerraTheWizard,only elder scrolls i've played is skyrim
07-12-2018T14:25:32,StarmanBlue,this church place seems like it could get really edgy really quickly
07-12-2018T14:25:40,CatzArt,I then went back and got morrowind for my old origional xbox but some games age like milk and TES morrowind was one of them
07-12-2018T14:25:48,TerraTheWizard,couldn't get past how bad the gfx had ages in the older ones to actually play them
07-12-2018T14:25:53,TerraTheWizard,*aged
07-12-2018T14:26:05,CrimsonHelsing,I never really cared for name colors much. Tried going orange one time but had to change it back because it was too close to Tom's color
07-12-2018T14:26:09,Aphala,Time was not kind to the TES games
07-12-2018T14:26:17,BadFoMo,I 'rage quit' Morrowind for being too text heavy. Also I didn't know how to level up right.
07-12-2018T14:26:42,TerraTheWizard,"yeah, people complain that they simplified the perks too much"
07-12-2018T14:26:50,MuonNeutrino,uhhhhhhh
07-12-2018T14:26:51,Aphala,Oblivion was good because it wasn't as hand hold-y as Skyrim or vague like Morrowind which I loved
07-12-2018T14:26:53,TerraTheWizard,but i heared if you did it wrong the game was unplayable
07-12-2018T14:26:58,MuonNeutrino,"well THAT is not ominous as hell, no not at all"
07-12-2018T14:27:20,CatzArt,Although when I read Tom's old Digigrade leds tutorial and he said that TES Morrowind was the inspiration I cant help but think of Flora walking in Morrowinds janky walk cycle for the beast races
07-12-2018T14:27:32,CatzArt,leds? legs
07-12-2018T14:27:37,TerraTheWizard,lol
07-12-2018T14:27:39,Corinthian,Lol
07-12-2018T14:27:45,Aphala,People just falling from the sky screaming
07-12-2018T14:27:47,Corinthian,Yeah those walk cycles were funny
07-12-2018T14:28:05,Corinthian,Tbh I perfer plantigrade legs on anthros.
07-12-2018T14:28:09,TerraTheWizard,"fun thing about that, one of the mods i prioritise having in skyrim is the digitigrade beast legs mod"
07-12-2018T14:28:20,Aphala,Saucy
07-12-2018T14:28:24,CatzArt,really Corin? why?
07-12-2018T14:28:27,TerraTheWizard,gimme dem khajiit peets & argonai raptor claws
07-12-2018T14:28:33,Corinthian,Idk it just looks better to me.
07-12-2018T14:28:33,TerraTheWizard,*argonian
07-12-2018T14:28:42,RimaDraws,lol
07-12-2018T14:28:45,CatzArt,I dont really have a preference

07-12-2018T14:29:02,Corinthian,bulli
07-12-2018T14:29:07,Aphala,I just prefer having legs to begin with
07-12-2018T14:29:11,Aphala,Baby steps
07-12-2018T14:29:18,TerraTheWizard,ol' baby legs
07-12-2018T14:29:26,Corinthian,But you can't walk if you don\t have feet
07-12-2018T14:29:27,Aphala,Baby legs O'Hurlihan
07-12-2018T14:29:39,CatzArt,Wasnt there some project to remake Morrowind with skyrim assests?
07-12-2018T14:29:46,BadFoMo,I like Digi-legs for anthros.
07-12-2018T14:29:48,Corinthian,"Yeah, Skywind"
07-12-2018T14:29:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"no legs, just torso on a skate board thats pulled by a Corgi"
07-12-2018T14:30:07,Aphala,Some mind quad stuff
07-12-2018T14:30:20,CatzArt,although Bethesda's shady stuff with fallout 76 has got me worried for TES 6
07-12-2018T14:30:36,Corinthian,Man that is a dumpster fire.
07-12-2018T14:30:50,Corinthian,Especially the whole nylon bag thing
07-12-2018T14:30:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,could be worse
07-12-2018T14:30:57,Aphala,Obsidians new game looks like it'll hurt Bethesd something fierce

07-12-2018T14:31:44,Twokinds,I'd like to think it's good for Bethesda in the long run.

07-12-2018T14:35:11,Bgrmystr2,"as with anything, art is a huge investment in time"

07-12-2018T14:55:09,CatzArt,I was going to ask if Sage was going to double stream but tom just answered my question

07-12-2018T14:55:47,MuonNeutrino,"dang, tom, could you possibly make it look any more ominous? heheh"
07-12-2018T14:55:48,SageSaga,Tom didnt answer any question there
07-12-2018T14:56:21,CatzArt,he set the stream to multi stream so kinda. at least in my mind yes
07-12-2018T14:56:26,MrMongMong,He could have the statue drip with blood...
07-12-2018T14:56:38,FoxxTrotter,The infamous Red Room...seen in many haunted houses.

07-12-2018T14:57:53,Bgrmystr2,"Sage does all the things, removes people, adds people, etc"
07-12-2018T14:58:04,StarmanBlue,"do you think adding some ""lips"" to the dragon might make the statue read better?"
07-12-2018T14:58:05,CatzArt,Who will say a few words for the deceased Nekoony?

07-12-2018T16:02:30,BadFoMo,A Folf if you will.
07-12-2018T16:02:58,MrMongMong,I think Wox sounds better. Reminds me of a website making utility.
07-12-2018T16:03:09,MrMongMong,"With Wox, you can make sites easily!"
07-12-2018T16:03:17,Bgrmystr2,"lol.. ""Maven"" Mix of Maren /Karen / Clovis?"
07-12-2018T16:03:29,CatzArt,We dont mention the Folf. you cant toss a dead cat without hitting a folf in the furry fandom
07-12-2018T16:03:30,BluePhantom90,I kinda thought Therie's Father was a Liger until Tom did the dark stripes

07-12-2018T16:07:43,CatzArt,But its a kentucky Long rifle so I only got one shot before I gotta reload
07-12-2018T16:08:13,Aphala,Just swing your fists
07-12-2018T16:08:18,Aphala,As fast as you can
07-12-2018T16:08:26,Aphala,He's not quick in the think box
07-12-2018T16:08:30,CatzArt,I could use the butt of the rifle as a club
07-12-2018T16:08:40,CatzArt,or fix a bayonet
07-12-2018T16:08:51,Aphala,That's good enough
07-12-2018T16:10:47,CatzArt,black powder guns are the best guns.
07-12-2018T16:11:43,MviluUatusun,Is Tom drawing or is he on break?  I ask because I see Laura looking off in the distance like I did several minutes ago.

07-12-2018T16:19:03,Bgrmystr2,"because it's a reference to the image where he was welcoming her to the gates of heaven, Mippy"

07-12-2018T16:53:51,Aphala,So does touching the tails come over as a sexual thing in the 2K universe?
07-12-2018T16:54:03,CatzArt,Yes she looks different than she did back in the comic. I attribute this to artist creep.
07-12-2018T16:54:10,Mandag,Probably in the same vein as touching ears/petting
07-12-2018T16:54:14,Bgrmystr2,"the comic kind of covers that, Aphala"
07-12-2018T16:54:15,CatzArt,Aphala no
07-12-2018T16:54:19,Aphala,Hmm
07-12-2018T16:54:21,Aphala,Was wondering
07-12-2018T16:54:38,Aphala,The more you know

07-12-2018T16:54:58,Mandag,"Same, Crimson"
07-12-2018T16:54:59,Bgrmystr2,who consider touching ears as something intimate

07-12-2018T16:55:27,Corinthian,This song really fits this picture.
07-12-2018T16:55:30,Bgrmystr2,but touching tail is like.. someone touching your arm or leg or something like that.
07-12-2018T16:55:43,Bgrmystr2,but also different?
07-12-2018T16:55:45,CrimsonQuill,That song is from UNDERTALE

07-12-2018T17:23:45,CatzArt,Do i lose reputation with the sage faction? do I have to go do quests now to restore my standing?
07-12-2018T17:24:14,SageSaga,or give me money
07-12-2018T17:24:18,Bgrmystr2,You make the assumption that you can restore anything.
07-12-2018T17:24:35,Bgrmystr2,"Once sage judges you, you have been judged forever."
07-12-2018T17:24:39,CatzArt,I was making a New vegas reference.

07-12-2018T17:39:22,SageSaga,then just the workers at the store would pile in and we'd leave a bunch of confused kids behind... not really- we left one person behind to watch the store...

07-12-2018T17:46:27,CatzArt,Hey sage what would you say the hardest thing to draw is on a body? I find the hands and shoulders to be the worst for me because my anatomy skill are bad
07-12-2018T17:46:28,Bgrmystr2,rofl phoenix yes yes they do
07-12-2018T17:46:32,BadFoMo,How are you chating?
07-12-2018T17:46:48,Killersblade16,So @microbus you are right
07-12-2018T17:47:07,microbuss,about what?
07-12-2018T17:47:28,Bgrmystr2,"everyone hates drawing hands, Catz"
07-12-2018T17:47:38,Bgrmystr2,it's a common thing
07-12-2018T17:47:48,Killersblade16,Stream  freezing
07-12-2018T17:47:57,Bgrmystr2,"that's just you, killer"
07-12-2018T17:47:57,microbuss,ah ok duh
07-12-2018T17:48:15,CatzArt,Whenever I draw them they turn out to small. Bugs me greatly. Any tips Bgr?
07-12-2018T17:48:27,Bgrmystr2,draw em bigger? :o
07-12-2018T17:48:34,microbuss,well what about de-feets?
07-12-2018T17:48:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,biggen the doodles
07-12-2018T17:48:43,SageSaga,Catz- probably feet atm for me
07-12-2018T17:48:45,Bgrmystr2,you've got hands and feet don't you?
07-12-2018T17:48:50,Bgrmystr2,use em for reference.
07-12-2018T17:49:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,hands suck!!!
07-12-2018T17:49:05,SageSaga,hands are easy to reference- feet not so much
07-12-2018T17:49:08,microbuss,well my dad's 2nd & 3rd toes are webbed hehe
07-12-2018T17:49:23,BadFoMo,...Wat?
07-12-2018T17:49:30,microbuss,honest
07-12-2018T17:49:44,SageSaga,it happens
07-12-2018T17:49:52,CatzArt,I can understand that sage.
07-12-2018T17:49:56,microbuss,born that way
07-12-2018T17:50:03,BadFoMo,Ok.
07-12-2018T17:50:16,microbuss,both feet
07-12-2018T17:50:21,Bgrmystr2,"funny that, sage, considering I see more people having more issues with hands rather than feet."
07-12-2018T17:50:36,Bgrmystr2,"but then again, feet are more simple so I guess it makes sense"
07-12-2018T17:50:39,Killersblade16,Be back later
07-12-2018T17:50:48,SageSaga,hands are still not super easy- but you draw em enough and you get used to it
07-12-2018T17:51:09,microbuss,crud me too but leaving this on Gotta return a rented movie
07-12-2018T17:51:10,SageSaga,feet are more complex than people give em credit
07-12-2018T17:51:15,SageSaga,and easy to hide
07-12-2018T17:51:27,Bgrmystr2,"like tom said about hands, draw em wrong and hope noone notices."
07-12-2018T17:51:34,BadFoMo,Bye.
07-12-2018T17:51:36,CatzArt,I use the old triangle method for feet. I find digi feet easier than plantigrade since Im a furry artist by trade.
07-12-2018T17:51:50,CatzArt,BYE FoMo!
07-12-2018T17:52:08,Bgrmystr2,"I don't think fomo was leaving, he was just saying bye to Killer most likely"
07-12-2018T17:52:14,CatzArt,oh
07-12-2018T17:52:16,BadFoMo,I'm not leaving yet.
07-12-2018T17:52:20,Bgrmystr2,see
07-12-2018T17:52:33,CatzArt,I just saw Fo say bye
07-12-2018T17:52:34,RedDragonSyndicate,Hey there
07-12-2018T17:52:37,SageSaga,i find Digi feet harder
07-12-2018T17:52:38,BadFoMo,Yo.
07-12-2018T17:52:39,SageSaga,yo Red
07-12-2018T17:52:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Red
07-12-2018T17:52:44,CatzArt,Sup red
07-12-2018T17:52:56,SageSaga,sometimes i hate that i gave Nyna digi feet
07-12-2018T17:53:11,Bgrmystr2,"yeah after you spend enough time on these streams, you can fairly easily translate messages like that, Catz"
07-12-2018T17:53:12,SageSaga,but i just need to practice
07-12-2018T17:53:14,Bgrmystr2,and heya Red
07-12-2018T17:54:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I can do digi better then plantigrade, but they still suck to draw, them with all there toes and pads and bleh"
07-12-2018T17:54:18,BadFoMo,Have a botched spell leave Nyna cursed with normal feet. Problem solved.
07-12-2018T17:54:18,CatzArt,Yeah sage your still way better at it than me and as long as you keep drawing it gets easier and easier.
07-12-2018T17:54:48,Bgrmystr2,maybe for one image he draws as a suggestion lol..
07-12-2018T17:54:55,Bgrmystr2,but not likely for the comic
07-12-2018T17:55:03,CatzArt,I actually need to go read the comic to find out who Nyna is. I will asume it to be the one with the teal hair
07-12-2018T17:55:13,BadFoMo,Yep.
07-12-2018T17:55:15,Bgrmystr2,yeah
07-12-2018T17:55:34,CatzArt,yeah for random guesses.
07-12-2018T17:56:11,CatzArt,to be fair the hardest part of art for me is coloring. all i ever do is sketchs so I have no experience coloring
07-12-2018T17:56:54,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah same
07-12-2018T17:57:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,coloring is pretty easy to get used to
07-12-2018T17:57:38,SageSaga,when shading - never use black for shading unless you are doing a stylized hard black ink style
07-12-2018T17:57:46,unsteddyphoenix,Sketching figures is just more fun
07-12-2018T17:57:57,unsteddyphoenix,Got any good tutorials or anythin Marv?
07-12-2018T17:58:01,CatzArt,I also dont know how to ink either
07-12-2018T17:58:53,SageSaga,inking is not as easy as it looks - however it is still basically tracing over your own work
07-12-2018T17:59:16,Bgrmystr2,just giving what you drew cleaner lines
07-12-2018T17:59:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Not really, I just.  All i do is use the magic wand tool and select inside the lineart from there lay down a base color.  Then using clipping masks I just go over till is looks right"
07-12-2018T17:59:30,CatzArt,Unsteady try watching Draw with Jazza sketching tutorial
07-12-2018T17:59:57,CatzArt,Also sage im a traditional artist so inking is hard because i cant erase
07-12-2018T18:00:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Oh God so many typos in that, I apologizes XD"
07-12-2018T18:00:36,SageSaga,Catz- then ink like a traditional artist
07-12-2018T18:00:42,SageSaga,use tracing paper
07-12-2018T18:00:52,CatzArt,tracing paper?
07-12-2018T18:01:00,unsteddyphoenix,Hmm
07-12-2018T18:01:01,SageSaga,it's translucent paper
07-12-2018T18:01:17,Bgrmystr2,"oh btw you guys talked about the blackout curtains, well I just got mine today. Haven't put them up yet, but they're promising. <3"
07-12-2018T18:01:19,SageSaga,you put it over your original sketch and draw over it
07-12-2018T18:01:28,CatzArt,I didnt know you could use tracing paper for that
07-12-2018T18:01:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Noise Bgr
07-12-2018T18:01:46,unsteddyphoenix,I'll just have to try make myself get into the habit
07-12-2018T18:01:57,unsteddyphoenix,I say that but im out of habit with sketching too ugh
07-12-2018T18:01:58,CatzArt,What do you do after that? Isnt tracing paper flimsy?
07-12-2018T18:02:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,you'll find a way that work best for you Teddy.  Just gotta dive in
07-12-2018T18:02:13,Bgrmystr2,"using another paper like that is just like a separate layer, Catz"
07-12-2018T18:02:36,unsteddyphoenix,Thanks marv! :)
07-12-2018T18:02:43,SageSaga,yeah- another method is to scan your sketch into a computer- and change the sketch color to light blue- then print out copies and  ink over it
07-12-2018T18:02:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,<3
07-12-2018T18:02:58,SageSaga,then you can scan it in BW only and the blue lines wont show up at all
07-12-2018T18:03:04,CatzArt,I just got a set of fine liners so I will try it out glad to know about this tracing paper thing  before I ruin the piece im working on
07-12-2018T18:03:54,CatzArt,Actually I have been using a non photo copy blue pencil for all my construction lines before using my regular pencil
07-12-2018T18:06:40,CatzArt,hehe im in an artsy mood now. Screw studying for my final! I got art to work on!
07-12-2018T18:06:58,JeremySenpai,Later Sage. Off to stream. Thanks for your art.
07-12-2018T18:07:08,SageSaga,take care!

07-12-2018T18:11:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I passed out like 3 times during the streams
07-12-2018T18:12:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve pulled a pokemon faint during a stream too
07-12-2018T18:12:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,we are not afternoon people
07-12-2018T18:13:25,RimaDraws,im a night owl
07-12-2018T18:13:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe it’s the noise. Cause I know I’ve yet to ever fall asleep during a Mark video
07-12-2018T18:13:37,Bgrmystr2,I didn't pass out at all during the stream.
07-12-2018T18:13:47,Bgrmystr2,"I woke up to tom streamin, and have been up since."
07-12-2018T18:13:59,RimaDraws,yea but ive been up since 5 am

07-12-2018T18:14:15,RimaDraws,like it
07-12-2018T18:14:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Very Lovely Sage
07-12-2018T18:14:17,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-excited:

07-12-2018T18:14:51,Bgrmystr2,lol I wonder what Kaylins worried about
07-12-2018T18:14:56,unsteddyphoenix,Great job sage!
07-12-2018T18:15:03,MultaniRaynz,where's the dialogue?
07-12-2018T18:15:08,SageSaga,"""Please Nyna? We can kill them together!"""
07-12-2018T18:15:08,Bgrmystr2,he doesn't add it
07-12-2018T18:15:19,RimaDraws,:3
07-12-2018T18:15:20,Bgrmystr2,you won't see dialogue till Wed when he posts it on the website.
07-12-2018T18:15:21,unsteddyphoenix,Just over there
07-12-2018T18:15:24,SageSaga,I do dialogue off stream
07-12-2018T18:15:37,MultaniRaynz,"oh, ok"
07-12-2018T18:15:53,Bgrmystr2,"that last panel is lookin nice, sage"
07-12-2018T18:16:03,SageSaga,it looks like a house!
07-12-2018T18:16:09,unsteddyphoenix,It does!
07-12-2018T18:16:10,SageSaga,this is important to me
07-12-2018T18:16:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Or a bungalow
07-12-2018T18:16:14,Bgrmystr2,"I was really questioning the angle and stuff when you first were drawing it and coloring it, but"
07-12-2018T18:16:23,Bgrmystr2,yeah that looks really damn nice now that it's finished
07-12-2018T18:16:26,Bgrmystr2,well done man
07-12-2018T18:16:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Cabin in the woods
07-12-2018T18:16:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Hunting hut
07-12-2018T18:16:50,Twokinds,Looks nice!
07-12-2018T18:16:55,SageSaga,thanks Tom!
07-12-2018T18:17:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Real good house
07-12-2018T18:17:28,SageSaga,Tom -did you miss last night what i said about having to do another house?
07-12-2018T18:17:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Nice n cozy looking. Like there’s a fire popping inside and hot chocolatie
07-12-2018T18:17:36,Bgrmystr2,lolol
07-12-2018T18:17:39,Bgrmystr2,"so dramatic, sage"
07-12-2018T18:17:50,Bgrmystr2,"it's just a house, and it looks nice"
07-12-2018T18:17:55,Bgrmystr2,why you so worried?
07-12-2018T18:18:14,SageSaga,drawing houses is not a strength of mine
07-12-2018T18:18:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Your sunset’s really gorgeous Sage
07-12-2018T18:18:30,Bgrmystr2,"the more you draw houses, the better you'll get at it"
07-12-2018T18:18:30,RimaDraws,i think it looks great. i can't draw buildings to save my life
07-12-2018T18:18:40,RimaDraws,agreed with bgr on this.
07-12-2018T18:19:12,SageSaga,characters have a bit of give when it comes to perspective- you can get away with a little bit-
07-12-2018T18:19:20,SageSaga,buildings and solid objects though? NOPE
07-12-2018T18:19:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Next side project: prowel neighborhoods and practice house drawing
07-12-2018T18:19:40,Bgrmystr2,yeah they look wonky unless you get the angles and such proper
07-12-2018T18:20:14,Bgrmystr2,thanks for streamin sage :D
07-12-2018T18:20:18,SpazztasticKiwi,“Not scoping your house. Just practicing my architecture skills “
07-12-2018T18:20:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Thanks for the streamy streams Sage
07-12-2018T18:20:31,CatzArt,yeah buildings are less likely to get angry if you try to draw them than people. Thanks for the stream Sage!
07-12-2018T18:20:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"Yea, bye bye Sage Sage"
07-12-2018T18:20:53,Bgrmystr2,"enjoy your D&D Tom, sage, gonna put up some curtains and stuff"
07-12-2018T18:21:04,SageSaga,take care folks thanks again for joining
07-12-2018T18:21:17,Bgrmystr2,tomorrow.. the first time the sun will not harass me :D
07-12-2018T18:21:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'm gonna be freezing in bed for kicks
07-12-2018T18:21:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Imma munch on oranges and binge YouTube
07-12-2018T18:24:02,microbuss,oops darn
07-12-2018T18:30:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Would y’all say “massive” and “very heavy” mean the same thing?
07-12-2018T18:30:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I use massive for size more then weight
07-12-2018T18:31:17,SpazztasticKiwi,These are descriptions for attack damage done by two attacks in Monster Legends
07-12-2018T18:31:35,SpazztasticKiwi,To me they look about equal in value
07-12-2018T18:32:11,Twokinds,Supermassive
07-12-2018T18:32:17,SpazztasticKiwi,But one will effect “all enemies” and the other will only hit one. BUT the attack that hits only one will apply a lasting damage effect
07-12-2018T18:32:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Supermassive games?
07-12-2018T18:32:39,unsteddyphoenix,"I mean, one's size and one's weight"
07-12-2018T18:32:45,SpazztasticKiwi,And I can only choose one attack. And I love this monster
07-12-2018T18:32:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I would go for all enemies my self
07-12-2018T18:33:05,unsteddyphoenix,"I assume ""massive"" is the area of effect one"
07-12-2018T18:33:16,unsteddyphoenix,"And ""heavy"" only hits one?"
07-12-2018T18:33:51,unsteddyphoenix,"When in doubt, hit everything"
07-12-2018T18:34:08,SpazztasticKiwi,“Very heavy” hits all enemies
07-12-2018T18:34:22,SpazztasticKiwi,“Massive” hits one. I have to replace one
07-12-2018T18:34:34,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh lol, that's backwards for me"
07-12-2018T18:34:38,unsteddyphoenix,Weird
07-12-2018T18:34:44,SpazztasticKiwi,The new attack though applies to all enemies too
07-12-2018T18:34:54,RimaDraws,unsteddy!
07-12-2018T18:34:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I like spreading the love, I vote for Very heavy"
07-12-2018T18:35:03,unsteddyphoenix,Hi!
07-12-2018T18:35:07,RimaDraws,hi hows you?
07-12-2018T18:35:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m thinking to replace the single enemy hit
07-12-2018T18:35:10,unsteddyphoenix,"I agree, very heavy"
07-12-2018T18:35:25,unsteddyphoenix,Im good thanks! How're you :)
07-12-2018T18:35:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"This isn’t my most powerful monster, but I do really like him and he’s useful"
07-12-2018T18:36:52,SpazztasticKiwi,And hey Tom
07-12-2018T18:37:38,RimaDraws,hi kiwi
07-12-2018T18:37:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Rimaaaaaaa:ptv-victory:

07-12-2018T18:38:05,RimaDraws,i need to get my art stream for patreon done too

07-12-2018T18:39:23,unsteddyphoenix,To motivate me
07-12-2018T18:40:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,one sec
07-12-2018T18:41:52,unsteddyphoenix,ty
07-12-2018T18:42:40,SpazztasticKiwi,That reminds me I gotta make sure I post Mandy’s birthday present this month
07-12-2018T18:44:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Think I just swallowed an orange seed
07-12-2018T18:45:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Why would you do that?
07-12-2018T18:45:29,unsteddyphoenix,free oranges in the long term
07-12-2018T18:45:38,SpazztasticKiwi,These oranges are supposed to be bred specifically to be seedless
07-12-2018T18:45:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Of course I get the special exception
07-12-2018T18:46:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,you got bamboozld
07-12-2018T18:46:50,RimaDraws,yea i stream sometimes to do commissions or patreon stuff.
07-12-2018T18:47:02,RimaDraws,i need to do some separate arts for patreon to draw in new peoples
07-12-2018T18:47:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though in other news, Bagheera lost his mind earlier"
07-12-2018T18:47:14,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah I tried watchin', but my connection wasnt great"
07-12-2018T18:47:19,RimaDraws,yea my kitty qrow is getting used to winter being here
07-12-2018T18:47:25,unsteddyphoenix,Aww thats good
07-12-2018T18:47:32,RimaDraws,he hasn't had another cat in the apartment till now
07-12-2018T18:47:43,SpazztasticKiwi,He was hopping around the living room with his toy and suddenly decided to football tackle my knee
07-12-2018T18:48:10,unsteddyphoenix,did he get a goal?
07-12-2018T18:48:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Tail puffed and everything
07-12-2018T18:48:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Even growling at the toy
07-12-2018T18:48:44,RimaDraws,awww
07-12-2018T18:49:11,SpazztasticKiwi,He didn’t bite down if that’s what you’re asking
07-12-2018T18:49:25,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s only hissed once or twice since I’ve had him
07-12-2018T18:50:13,unsteddyphoenix,aw what a good
07-12-2018T18:50:31,RimaDraws,mine never hissed till i brought winter in the house
07-12-2018T18:51:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,mine have hissed a few times.  But I do have dogs so that explains that
07-12-2018T18:51:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Kiwi only hisses to be viscous. And she’s not very loud
07-12-2018T18:51:57,SpazztasticKiwi,More like “did you hear somethin’?”
07-12-2018T18:52:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Awww
07-12-2018T18:52:46,RimaDraws,yea this is a new cat i am taking care of because some of her humans were poor owners.
07-12-2018T18:52:57,unsteddyphoenix,:(((
07-12-2018T18:53:07,unsteddyphoenix,Good on you for rescuing her
07-12-2018T18:53:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Neither are aggressive cats. Bagheera’s more likely to fight - he’s started a few being a pushy brat
07-12-2018T18:53:21,RimaDraws,they have four dogs already and three sleep in the cold while one stays in the house. their first cat they left to freeze outside so i am taking this one in.
07-12-2018T18:54:03,SpazztasticKiwi,The first froze to death?
07-12-2018T18:54:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Excuse me?
07-12-2018T18:54:39,unsteddyphoenix,Oh god
07-12-2018T18:55:29,Bgrmystr2,that's animal cruelty
07-12-2018T18:55:33,Bgrmystr2,straight up
07-12-2018T18:55:53,SpazztasticKiwi,You can report them for the dogs
07-12-2018T18:55:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Get them taken away
07-12-2018T18:56:24,Bgrmystr2,absolutely ^
07-12-2018T18:57:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"And eventually, if they take to many away, the state of the seized animals are bad enough, or they never show change, they can be banned form and future pet ownership of so much as a hamster"
07-12-2018T18:57:06,SpazztasticKiwi,too
07-12-2018T18:57:14,SpazztasticKiwi,from
07-12-2018T18:59:18,RimaDraws,we dont report them because my nana doesn't want conflict with her neighbors but i told her she is just as bad for letting them do that if she dont. she doesn't like to be conflicted with people.
07-12-2018T18:59:46,RimaDraws,and we can't get proof they are rejecting them without getting close to the fence of the back yard
07-12-2018T19:00:00,RimaDraws,but i took this poor baby in because i didn't want to see her starve or freeze
07-12-2018T19:02:00,unsteddyphoenix,Youre good people
07-12-2018T19:02:07,RimaDraws,qrow is just taking some getting used to her but so far since i have had her he hasn't tried to knock down the tree loll
07-12-2018T19:03:48,SpazztasticKiwi,They don’t have to know it was you that reported. You just drop the tip to the cops and they investigate. Half the time they won’t even remember your name to tattle to the neighbors it was you even if the same cop investigates
07-12-2018T19:04:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"Plus, reporting crimes comes with unspoken right to anonymity"
07-12-2018T19:04:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Generally
07-12-2018T19:05:16,Bgrmystr2,reporting a crime usually goes with the police NOT telling the person that's guilty of said crime
07-12-2018T19:05:29,RimaDraws,well
07-12-2018T19:05:34,RimaDraws,we are their only neighbors
07-12-2018T19:05:44,RimaDraws,so yes they would know even if its anonymous
07-12-2018T19:05:57,Bgrmystr2,"no they wouldn't, cuz it could be anyone"
07-12-2018T19:06:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"For all they’d know, it was a visitor to the neighborhood or a drive through check in"
07-12-2018T19:06:04,Bgrmystr2,just someone walking down the street
07-12-2018T19:06:06,Bgrmystr2,exactly
07-12-2018T19:06:13,Bgrmystr2,they wouldn't know who it is
07-12-2018T19:06:29,RimaDraws,that is true. if i spot them bring in one more animal i will report it. because i live in town and they wouldn't suspect me.
07-12-2018T19:06:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"Surprisingly enough, there are places that have fly o we and drive through investigations"
07-12-2018T19:07:12,SpazztasticKiwi,We have cops fly over for pot and crack dealers hiding in remote areas often
07-12-2018T19:07:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m sure most are just regular airplanes but we’ve had trespassers before
07-12-2018T19:08:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"And the game warden’s come up here for us to get an out-of-season hunter or two. He’s checked in a few times for the hell of it, even"
07-12-2018T19:09:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"Granted, pot and crack dealers is a bit extreme. We mainly have people sneak in to drink off in the woods"
07-12-2018T19:11:09,RimaDraws,oh wow
07-12-2018T19:12:28,SpazztasticKiwi,We had one guy who’d come up to hunt - with no permission to be on the property let alone to actually hunt. He left messes sometimes
07-12-2018T19:12:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"After telling the cops, we find out he’s got a warrant"

07-12-2018T19:26:50,Bgrmystr2,I don't usually miss typos when reading
07-12-2018T19:28:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh Bgr. I got something that I think you’ll find entertaining about new dude at work
07-12-2018T19:28:55,SpazztasticKiwi,He says he’s been hit by lightning
07-12-2018T19:29:02,SpazztasticKiwi,But guess how many times
07-12-2018T19:30:08,Bgrmystr2,probably some abnormal number
07-12-2018T19:30:16,SpazztasticKiwi,3
07-12-2018T19:30:22,Bgrmystr2,oh that's not that abnormal
07-12-2018T19:30:32,Bgrmystr2,people live through lightning strikes all the time
07-12-2018T19:30:43,Bgrmystr2,there's this one guy who lived through like.. a dozen or someshit
07-12-2018T19:30:45,Bgrmystr2,it's crazy
07-12-2018T19:30:55,RimaDraws,i think i cured the spoiled brat in qrow with winter
07-12-2018T19:31:10,RimaDraws,and all it took for him was to get her scent by sniffing her but as weird as it sounds
07-12-2018T19:31:13,SpazztasticKiwi,He says it’s documented and I don’t doubt it. I just haven’t seen those documents so I’m more like “k cool”
07-12-2018T19:31:33,Mippy,Just got my shipping notice :ctwokinds-lynnsmile:

07-12-2018T19:46:40,unsteddyphoenix,Then they are useless

07-12-2018T19:47:02,unsteddyphoenix,And move I did not
07-12-2018T19:47:07,Bgrmystr2,should I ditch phoenix since he doesn't own a pet either? Does that make him equally useless?
07-12-2018T19:47:16,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah! :D
07-12-2018T19:47:16,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
