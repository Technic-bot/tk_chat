21-06-2018T00:14:23,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I always felt the subtleseed was vaguely like a wedding band judging by the reactions when trace gave it to her :thinking:
21-06-2018T00:14:39,unsteddyphoenix,He should just give her another one anyway
21-06-2018T00:14:41,unsteddyphoenix,dual-seeds
21-06-2018T00:15:00,Bgrmystr2,"double the seed, double the love? :ptv-ohmy:"
21-06-2018T00:15:52,unsteddyphoenix,Thats higher love efficiency :ptv-sneakysmirk:
21-06-2018T03:27:52,Bgrmystr2,"welp, chat broke on that tab. had to reload entirely"
21-06-2018T03:35:17,SiliconCarbide,picarto restarted their chat server for maintenance
21-06-2018T03:36:07,Bgrmystr2,yes I know
21-06-2018T03:36:14,Bgrmystr2,Mine never reconnected.
21-06-2018T03:36:27,Bgrmystr2,It got stuck in the infinite reconnecting loop as it always does.
21-06-2018T10:11:34,Twokinds,Morning!
21-06-2018T10:12:15,iliar,"Good morning, Tom!"
21-06-2018T10:17:46,Xexanoth,Good [Insert phrase appropriate to time at your location here]
21-06-2018T10:23:49,JamesBSquirrel3,"Morning, Tom ...:ptv-grossedout: ... I'm not very well of work of this stupid ""Severe Hayfever""!"
21-06-2018T10:30:51,SiliconCarbide,hey there tom
21-06-2018T10:31:42,Twokinds,I'm signing the last of the prints
21-06-2018T10:33:29,iliar,Wow. It seemed to me that you started signing them for a long time ago.
21-06-2018T10:34:51,iliar,A few weeks ... maybe more.
21-06-2018T10:36:14,Twokinds,I had a lot of work to do
21-06-2018T10:36:42,JamesBSquirrel3,"Hey Tom, I'm curious, when is in results of colouring votes takes place, was it this Sunday or Next Sunday as at the end of the month?"
21-06-2018T10:36:55,iliar,"In that case, I can congratulate you."
21-06-2018T10:38:13,Twokinds,Color stream is on July 1
21-06-2018T10:38:54,JamesBSquirrel3,"Well I though I knew was right ""at the end of the month""!"
21-06-2018T10:42:26,iliar,Well... we already have few good sketches + another one sketch stream. In this month voting well be hard.
21-06-2018T10:44:25,JamesBSquirrel3,Meaning another 7 it totals = 21! 21 sketches to decides on TOP 5 Colors!
21-06-2018T10:45:40,Xexanoth,"yeah, we pretty much need a color stream for last week alone"
21-06-2018T10:46:15,iliar,20 sketches... one of the sketches is excluded from voting for some reasons.
21-06-2018T10:47:05,JamesBSquirrel3,More than 20?
21-06-2018T10:48:07,Twokinds,20 - 24 sketches is pretty typical
21-06-2018T10:49:53,iliar,Yeah. But not all sketches excellent. In this month a lot of excellent sketches.
21-06-2018T10:51:07,JamesBSquirrel3,Then there's got to be excellent ones in order to get in Top 5 right into Color!
21-06-2018T10:51:29,Twokinds,I predict Adira
21-06-2018T10:51:48,Xexanoth,"nah, what makes you think that XD"
21-06-2018T10:52:27,iliar,Aha. I'm pretty sure that Adira will win.
21-06-2018T10:53:55,JamesBSquirrel3,"In my opinion of 2 pics runners-up, I'll go Therie Sah-Van, and Daniels, with one night baby, and Therie's father!:heart_eyes_cat::heart_eyes_cat::ptv-hearts:"
21-06-2018T10:54:18,Xexanoth,hmm since you'll be on conventions 2 of the weeks in July you got anything special planned for the 15th? if you're going by normal you either end up doing color for 1 week or for 6 weeks...
21-06-2018T10:55:31,Xexanoth,"5 weeks not since, my math broke"
21-06-2018T10:55:48,iliar,I'll bet that one of the skits with drunk Kat will be winner too. Although I will not be happy about it. I do not like drunk people.
21-06-2018T10:56:07,Xexanoth,wouldn't that depend on how drunk they are?
21-06-2018T10:56:23,Xexanoth,there's a pretty big spectrum there
21-06-2018T10:57:35,JamesBSquirrel3,"Well it wouldn't nessercary for children, though.:ptv-wondering:"
21-06-2018T11:02:17,JamesBSquirrel3,"brb I will have relaxing bath to be clean, I see you soon for one last this of Voting Sketches, and following Top 5 colors results! In the meantime; I see you on-air of Latest Comic New Art Page! Good Luck!:ptv-hearts:"
21-06-2018T11:02:20,iliar,"Well, considering that in the end, Kat lost consciousness. I think she was very drunk."
21-06-2018T11:06:19,Xexanoth,"eh, she was just tired from working hard :D"
21-06-2018T11:32:34,Twokinds,The problem with my signature is that I like to make them all look nice.
21-06-2018T11:33:33,Twokinds,So each signature takes me about 8 seconds.
21-06-2018T11:34:09,Twokinds,"Which might not sound like a lot, but it's quite a bit to spend signing."
21-06-2018T12:24:20,Xexanoth,meanwhile when i sign something my hand has to remember what writing even is :/
21-06-2018T12:24:42,Xexanoth,*what is this weird thing that i havent don in weeks* XD
21-06-2018T12:56:50,Trevuxnouxe,I have no intrest in streams anymore...
21-06-2018T13:43:56,Bgrmystr2,"It's okay, some people come and go"
21-06-2018T14:29:17,JamesBSquirrel3,wb + brb More than 5-and-a-half hours to go on-air Art!:ptv-victory:
21-06-2018T14:54:22,Twokinds,"Phew, done."
21-06-2018T15:31:33,Dadrobit,\o/ Grats on the signatures.
21-06-2018T15:33:57,Dadrobit,Probably gonna miss the stream tonight I think. Just have a ton of work to do.
21-06-2018T15:35:16,Dadrobit,"Hopefully I can make some time to check in, but if not, here's hoping for a good, fruitful stream tonight."
21-06-2018T15:41:43,Twokinds,Holy crap shipping is expensive.
21-06-2018T15:41:51,Twokinds,"40 lb box to cali, 100 dollars"
21-06-2018T15:54:01,SiliconCarbide,"too expensive, guess you have to carry them yourself"
21-06-2018T16:06:12,Twokinds,I almost could. Some plane tickets aren't much more than that.
21-06-2018T16:06:20,Twokinds,Just stick it in my luggage.
21-06-2018T16:07:10,Twokinds,"Ah well, no matter. Signed prints packaged up."
21-06-2018T16:07:34,Twokinds,They better not lose it. I'm not signing those again.
21-06-2018T16:09:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚ÄúYou know that plane carrying your prints? Yeah, they forgot to close the luggage port and they‚Äôre currently scattered over the terminal‚Äù"
21-06-2018T16:09:48,Xexanoth,*cue anime moment of Printse getting swept away by wind*
21-06-2018T16:20:20,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah imma miss it too probably :ctwokinds-LauraCry:
21-06-2018T16:20:42,unsteddyphoenix,Hope you somehow have a good stream without me~
21-06-2018T16:22:45,unsteddyphoenix,Also just saying that has increase the value of those signatures exponentially
21-06-2018T16:33:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you ever mess up a print, just write ‚ÄúHolly ‚Äòhelped‚Äô‚Äù"
21-06-2018T16:37:12,unsteddyphoenix,(Holly wuz here)
21-06-2018T16:37:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm gonna grab a lunch and be back later
21-06-2018T17:50:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"The mom of this kid just asked her small daughter if she wanted a chicken taco, and that kid just started jumping around, thrilled"
21-06-2018T17:50:43,SpazztasticKiwi,She likes chicken tacos apparently
21-06-2018T17:52:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Kids are cute when they‚Äôre not having a meltdown
21-06-2018T18:33:50,CrRAR,2kinds fan's worst nightmare rn: https://i.imgur.com/ij4srq6.gifv

21-06-2018T18:35:47,CrRAR,A solitary luggage off to find its people~
21-06-2018T18:37:07,Twokinds,There goes all the Raines
21-06-2018T18:37:23,CrRAR,;_;
21-06-2018T18:37:49,Xexanoth,they just want to be free
21-06-2018T18:37:57,Xexanoth,and join their sisters in the wild
21-06-2018T18:38:32,CrRAR,the call of the wild was... too strong. :')
21-06-2018T18:39:00,Xexanoth,the call of the wild sounds suspiciously like an awoooo
21-06-2018T18:39:29,CrRAR,XD it actually probably does considering the whine of jet engines spinning up.
21-06-2018T18:39:36,CrRAR,"In that context, it's sort of a ""I'm not even mad moment"""
21-06-2018T18:40:12,Xexanoth,TIL jet engines are powered by wolf howls
21-06-2018T18:40:16,Xexanoth,:D

21-06-2018T19:50:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Well the burritos aren‚Äôt chocolate scented
21-06-2018T19:51:22,CrRAR,uhh you may get the illusion that they are if you apply the lipstick first.
21-06-2018T19:51:30,CrRAR,you have been warned~
21-06-2018T19:51:32,CrRAR,haha
21-06-2018T19:51:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I doubt it tastes as good as it smells
21-06-2018T19:52:15,ThingsAreMoving,everything is chocolate scented if you shove some chocolate up your nose
21-06-2018T19:52:18,ThingsAreMoving,o/ btw

21-06-2018T19:55:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm convinced cats are furry toddlers cause Bagheera did a bad today and he‚Äôs currently trying his best to suck up

21-06-2018T20:03:01,Matth3w23,I don't run either. My nose does though.
21-06-2018T20:03:17,ThingsAreMoving,I usually run out of patience when I'm dealing with morons. Fortunately that doesn't happen often.
21-06-2018T20:03:24,CrRAR,"Running is a hobby best... yeah no, I can't defend it either."

21-06-2018T20:05:08,CrRAR,It is quite an addictive form of exercise.

21-06-2018T20:09:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Ross
21-06-2018T20:09:26,Bgrmystr2,"I know you're supposed to update the stream after the streamer goes live, not when the chats begin."
21-06-2018T20:09:31,Bgrmystr2,but it's irrelevant
21-06-2018T20:09:36,Bgrmystr2,"cuz even if I click after, it does nothing."
21-06-2018T20:09:43,Bgrmystr2,the bar just goes away.
21-06-2018T20:09:51,Rosscoe,Some times it works
21-06-2018T20:09:54,ThingsAreMoving,did you file a ticket to the support?
21-06-2018T20:09:56,Rosscoe,some times it dont
21-06-2018T20:09:57,ZRO4825,"If they join the stream before their stream is actually up and running, and you hit update before they start, the update seems to kinda freak out most of the time, lol"
21-06-2018T20:10:29,Bgrmystr2,"pity it doesn't work even if you click it after the streamer goes live, Zro"
21-06-2018T20:10:33,Sammit,Hi Everybody

21-06-2018T20:11:20,Bgrmystr2,"and Things, I haven't told support, but I mean.. You'd think with such a widespread problem, one more message in the sea they already get won't make too big of a diff"

21-06-2018T20:56:54,Tharkis,"y'know when i first met Nekonny in person, i was a bit relieved that he's actually a hair older than I am, since everyone else I was meeting was way younger than myself lol."

21-06-2018T20:58:19,McClaw,Is it wrong of me to imagine giving the dragon girl Tom is drawing some belly rubs?
21-06-2018T20:58:31,CrRAR,uhh

21-06-2018T20:58:55,SageSaga,those are Saw inspired belly rubs- no good
21-06-2018T20:58:55,ZahnHolley,Hi guys !!

21-06-2018T20:59:01,Bgrmystr2,Is Mr Claw related to Dr Claw?
21-06-2018T20:59:01,Nekonny,so much stuff going on

21-06-2018T20:59:15,SageSaga,Mr Claw lost his doctorate
21-06-2018T20:59:16,MrEase,Okay moving right along :V
21-06-2018T20:59:18,ZRO4825,Unless you're into that. Then go ahead and get genderswapped. :P
21-06-2018T20:59:26,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
21-06-2018T20:59:41,SageSaga,when you do harm like that you broke your oath as a medical practitioner
21-06-2018T20:59:42,Cebelius,I admittedly came in because I watch Nekonny ... and am now reminded that I haven't checked up on two-kinds in something like six years. Lost track of all the comics I used to read when I went overseas.
21-06-2018T20:59:49,Cebelius,"You've really improved, Tom."
21-06-2018T20:59:59,ZahnHolley,How yall doing? :D

21-06-2018T21:02:15,Nekonny,I drew this a long time ago
21-06-2018T21:02:16,Cebelius,"It's SUMMER, in TEXAS. Paradise it is not."
21-06-2018T21:02:31,Combak,Hell?
21-06-2018T21:02:31,Nekonny,Dr claw actually looks like... jim carry
21-06-2018T21:02:36,Bgrmystr2,"Blade, we already went over it. He's Mr Claw now."
21-06-2018T21:02:44,Bgrmystr2,:c
21-06-2018T21:02:46,Cebelius,I wouldn't go that far Combak. Kuwait would be closer to hell than this.
21-06-2018T21:02:53,WanderingUnicorn,Cebelius - no better here in Florida
21-06-2018T21:03:03,Cebelius,Florida and Kuwait have almost EXACTLY the same weather.
21-06-2018T21:03:15,FoxxTrotter,Been hot in Kakalaka as well.
21-06-2018T21:03:17,Mihari,Temperature is not what solely defines paradise
21-06-2018T21:03:20,Cebelius,1000% humidity and 130 in the shade.
21-06-2018T21:03:25,Pdud,man i had no clue that yosh and 2kinds did these live streams until a couple hours ago im so excited
21-06-2018T21:03:37,Nekonny,yay florida
21-06-2018T21:03:48,Cebelius,Tru Mihari. I do like the fact that I don't pay state income tax.
21-06-2018T21:03:50,Bgrmystr2,lol is that from the original creator of the series?
21-06-2018T21:03:53,Char89TheCharizard,I live in Florida

21-06-2018T21:05:37,Mihari,"I dunno, I live in Texas, and it's 74¬∞F right now :P"
21-06-2018T21:05:43,Cebelius,"Well there's the north, and then there's THE NORTH."
21-06-2018T21:05:45,FoxxTrotter,I'm in that void where it rains everywhere else around me but where I'm at. :0P
21-06-2018T21:05:49,Dimensional,Of course the sun has set in Texas.

21-06-2018T21:06:17,Cebelius,"Mihari: I'm in DFW. It's not as bad as it's going to get, but if I can't sit out on my front porch without sweating buckets in the shade, it's too hot."
21-06-2018T21:06:37,Nekonny,"I don't know, florida is a great place"
21-06-2018T21:06:37,SageSaga,there is your mistake
21-06-2018T21:06:40,SageSaga,sitting outside
21-06-2018T21:06:52,SageSaga,inside is where it's at
21-06-2018T21:06:53,Bgrmystr2,I've been to Boston during a winter blizzard with sub-zero temps.. yeah I'd take the hot and wet weather here on the gulf coast over that anyday
21-06-2018T21:06:57,Cebelius,I LIKE outside. Get to see all sorts of neat stuff.
21-06-2018T21:07:02,TheFDdriver,its 81 right now

21-06-2018T21:07:19,SageSaga,you can see all that and more from inside at a monitor
21-06-2018T21:07:35,TheFDdriver,lol
21-06-2018T21:07:44,Tharkis,"problem with florida is it's wicked muggy all the time, but the rain showers every afternoon are nice =D"
21-06-2018T21:07:50,Nekonny,florida and texas became states the same year
21-06-2018T21:07:57,Cebelius,"Eh. I spent all day working on a monitor, and even now I'm editing as I chat. when I get a nice cigar and sit, I like to sit outside."
21-06-2018T21:08:22,Twokinds,I tried hooking up a third monitor to my computer recently. Tripped my circuit breaker
21-06-2018T21:08:23,SageSaga,"Ron, no one wants to hear about reclaimed swampland that is sinking"
21-06-2018T21:08:33,TheFDdriver,earlier i went outside and its started raining
21-06-2018T21:08:34,Justanotheruser7118,That moment when you're the only one using Celsius
21-06-2018T21:08:35,CrRAR,:&lt;
21-06-2018T21:08:53,Cebelius,All I know about Celsius is 18 degrees is perfect.
21-06-2018T21:08:58,CrRAR,That's... a extremely small electrical margin Tom xD
21-06-2018T21:09:00,Bgrmystr2,Sage that hurts. I live in one of those places. :C
21-06-2018T21:09:02,Combak,Nice job Tom. XD
21-06-2018T21:09:03,MrAMP,swampland is a name of an actual icecream flavor.  It's pretty good.

21-06-2018T21:09:49,Justanotheruser7118,"You see, Fahrenheit is a percentage of how hot it is."
21-06-2018T21:09:59,Twokinds,Yeah this house has terrible electrical

21-06-2018T21:10:16,Bgrmystr2,"that's terrible, tom"

21-06-2018T21:10:27,Char89TheCharizard,My laptop can only connect to one monitor because it only has 1 VGA port and no HDMI port
21-06-2018T21:10:27,FoxxTrotter,"Yeah, that's not good with some devices and appliances."

21-06-2018T21:11:05,Ordithus,You could always keep the house and update the electrical

21-06-2018T21:12:21,Cebelius,DVI-I or DVI-D?
21-06-2018T21:12:23,Mihari,Is it a bulky blue or black port? Or a bunch of small USB-ish like ports?
21-06-2018T21:12:29,Bgrmystr2,"I would suggest a VGA splitter, but that'd only give you two monitors with the same thing on both screens"

21-06-2018T22:01:02,VosRegera,"Being male has his perks and his drawbacks, overall i like being one a lot."
21-06-2018T22:01:14,MallardDuckAvia,I don‚Äôt like it at all.
21-06-2018T22:01:16,BadFoMo,Why is Nora reminding me of the queen in 'Den' from Heavy Metal?
21-06-2018T22:02:01,MallardDuckAvia,I‚Äôd rather Cary a few pounds more on my chest than have a lump in my pants that always comes at the worst possible moment
21-06-2018T22:02:15,VosRegera,"Hmm, Tycho, this is good music yes sir."
21-06-2018T22:02:15,RimaDraws,great work tom &lt;3 love the wrinkles in the bed where she's laying down. detail is life &lt;3
21-06-2018T22:02:34,CrimsonHelsing,Heavy metal? You mean that mtv movie?
21-06-2018T22:02:47,WanderingUnicorn,"Yes, excellent attention to the details"

21-06-2018T22:03:02,CrRAR,It is beautiful. I'm reminded of once when Flora was in a heart bed like this once I think.
21-06-2018T22:03:07,Twokinds,Thanks!
21-06-2018T22:03:09,BadFoMo,The 1981 film? Then yes.
21-06-2018T22:03:18,RimaDraws,im a sucker for details
21-06-2018T22:03:30,GoreSoul,Why no one loves  Madam Reni enough to request her in her dragoness majetic form or in human form?? T_T
21-06-2018T22:03:59,Dimensional,Becuase Nora is known for her creative imaginations. Reni isn't.
21-06-2018T22:04:09,BadFoMo,Human form is a spoiler for now.
21-06-2018T22:04:10,swack24,Nora is so sexy
21-06-2018T22:04:13,WanderingUnicorn,"Mallard- just so you know, there are dudes who wish they had that problem."
21-06-2018T22:04:14,GoreSoul,I mean dragoness 2 way in that bed here would be so innocent and sexy!
21-06-2018T22:04:29,happyguyone,hello yuki &lt;3
21-06-2018T22:04:45,RimaDraws,just wanna lay on that bed now so fluffy -3-
21-06-2018T22:05:03,swack24,Didn't Nora used t have long hair?
21-06-2018T22:05:07,MrAMP,Nice Hometown Friday pic Nekonny
21-06-2018T22:05:10,Bgrmystr2,@GoreSoul people HAVE requested Reni in her human form. Tom won't do it because spoiler reasons.
21-06-2018T22:05:15,Dimensional,"Yes, a fluffy bed is what you want to sleep in. Not just because it has a sexy dragoness in it. :3"
21-06-2018T22:05:21,VosRegera,Reni would be uncomfortable in a human form.
21-06-2018T22:05:32,CrRAR,appropriately tied up hair?
21-06-2018T22:05:38,RimaDraws,im serious just the bed itself looks just ah omg &gt;&lt;
21-06-2018T22:05:38,Dimensional,Not a lot of dragons can handle walking on 2 legs.
21-06-2018T22:05:45,Dimensional,Reni might be able to because of her mixed heritage.
21-06-2018T22:05:56,BadFoMo,I thought that was just Nora.
21-06-2018T22:05:56,Dimensional,Probably spent a lot of time walking on 2 legs.
21-06-2018T22:06:41,MallardDuckAvia,Other than that one week every month I don‚Äôt see any real problems I would have with being female
21-06-2018T22:06:42,VosRegera,"Probably, but she was kind of nervous when Trace asked her how can be possible for a dragon to have a mixed ascendance"

21-06-2018T22:07:02,SageSaga,you know- for some reason i really want a Phoenix Wright case to hinge on the fact that a witness claimed to see the murderer because he was eating food at a Chick-fil-a on a Sunday
21-06-2018T22:07:37,WanderingUnicorn,Not getting the reference...
21-06-2018T22:07:47,Cebelius,"Lies, Everyone knows Chick-fil-a is closed on sunday."
21-06-2018T22:07:53,SageSaga,exactly!

21-06-2018T22:11:02,MallardDuckAvia,Why is everyone older than me?
21-06-2018T22:11:03,iliar,Did you remove the light from the window? I think this is a good decision.
21-06-2018T22:11:05,Ordithus,"You know you've reached adulthood, when you realize that no one know what they are doing any better than you do"

21-06-2018T22:13:43,Tharkis,i'm old enough that i get mistaken for being older than i actually am because of the amount of grey i have

21-06-2018T22:23:10,RimaDraws,i didn't either mallard till i hit 20 and then divorced
21-06-2018T22:23:16,WanderingUnicorn,"Mallard - shaving is a pain, unless you plan on growing a beard"
21-06-2018T22:23:23,ZahnHolley,"that mermaid reminds me of ariel,"
21-06-2018T22:23:29,Tharkis,"i tell you what, meeting people gets harder as you get older.  Would I love to meet someone and 'settle down' sure, but i'll be totally happy with some friends who i can hang out with online and play games or stuff with."
21-06-2018T22:23:31,MallardDuckAvia,I‚Äôm going straight to the Air Force then to American Airlines or whoever is big in Phoenix in 20 years
21-06-2018T22:23:50,Tharkis,the internet makes it easy to not feel 'lonely'
21-06-2018T22:23:59,JamesBSquirrel3,"wb:ptv-grossedout: Once again, Hayfever kicks me again after good night sleep! (sigh)"
21-06-2018T22:24:03,VosRegera,I heard that shaving with a straight razor was a lot less painfull... when you don't cut yourself
21-06-2018T22:24:15,MallardDuckAvia,I have a total of 3 friends in the real world
21-06-2018T22:24:24,MallardDuckAvia,None are female
21-06-2018T22:24:25,Tharkis,you have to know how to sharpen and hone  if you're going to use a straight razor
21-06-2018T22:24:37,CrRAR,lol
21-06-2018T22:24:47,CrRAR,Nora puttin on the red light~
21-06-2018T22:24:48,totallynotTrace,"Mallard: you dont plan on it, but then one day you (oh god help me this sounds cliche) meet someone and poof your beggining to think differently"
21-06-2018T22:24:49,Tharkis,"unless you're buying a nice hand made razor, none of them come with a proper cutting edge"
21-06-2018T22:24:54,Ordithus,"Mach 50, shaves so close it removes the hair down to the bone"
21-06-2018T22:24:59,VosRegera,"Yes, that's very important, and the shaving cream is important too"
21-06-2018T22:25:03,Mippy,Thta's a good number Mallard. Rarther a couple close friends than a crowd...less backstabbing usually
21-06-2018T22:25:10,MallardDuckAvia,I don‚Äôt even grow facial hair yet. I want a beard or something like that really bad
21-06-2018T22:25:23,ZahnHolley,eww

21-06-2018T22:25:57,Ordithus,I tried the beard thing in college.  I have a red beard
21-06-2018T22:26:00,SageSaga,real beards are hard work to maintain
21-06-2018T22:26:02,WanderingUnicorn,"In the AF, you'll have to be clean shaven"
21-06-2018T22:26:04,Katfeathers,Not once it grows enough

21-06-2018T22:26:41,Tharkis,so i look like a civil war general instead of a viking =D
21-06-2018T22:26:45,MallardDuckAvia,I just realized I‚Äôm weird for wanting to be female but wanting facial hair at the same time
21-06-2018T22:26:54,Tharkis,so i keep it trimmed to under an inch long usually
21-06-2018T22:26:57,Ordithus,You want to be the bearded lady
21-06-2018T22:27:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,thats why you bead it Tharkis

21-06-2018T22:27:45,totallynotTrace,"its like, take care of it every day so that you dont look bad, but if you want a long beard you stilll need to trim stuff every day but you feel that you need a barbers training to know and then you get mad at it and shave off 5 inches just cause"
21-06-2018T22:27:48,microbuss,heh thinking of bed myself
21-06-2018T22:28:10,Tharkis,could just got like Egil from the sagas and shave my head
21-06-2018T22:28:20,Tharkis,but then i'd have to tell poetry while killing people
21-06-2018T22:28:23,Tharkis,and i'm a terrible poet
21-06-2018T22:28:30,MallardDuckAvia,I can‚Äôt sleep even in bed. I got 30 minutes of sleep last night. The rest was starting at the ceiling
