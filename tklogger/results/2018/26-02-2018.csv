26-02-2018T21:00:28,MidnightBlue78,I was watching the movie Wonder. It's really nice.

26-02-2018T22:04:07,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s a  l i n e
26-02-2018T22:04:33,JaydenMozingo,Are there any drawing softwares that cost ONE payment to make and then you just own it?
26-02-2018T22:04:45,JaydenMozingo,Rather than making monthy payments?
26-02-2018T22:05:10,JaydenMozingo,Because Krita isn't that... good
26-02-2018T22:05:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Not that I can think of
26-02-2018T22:06:00,BadFoMo,...Maybe GIMP?
26-02-2018T22:06:35,JaydenMozingo,Gimp is terrible
26-02-2018T22:06:48,BadFoMo,Gimp is Free.
26-02-2018T22:06:52,JaydenMozingo,I tried. It doesnt have propper layering
26-02-2018T22:07:19,JaydenMozingo,Krita is a bit better I suppose...
26-02-2018T22:07:44,BadFoMo,What are you trying to do?
26-02-2018T22:09:05,JaydenMozingo,Get a reliable software that doesnt have monthly payments
26-02-2018T22:09:19,JaydenMozingo,Just one purchase and thats it
26-02-2018T22:09:41,BadFoMo,I ment the layering part?
26-02-2018T22:09:45,BadFoMo,*.
26-02-2018T22:10:16,JaydenMozingo,Oh. Just layering that works
26-02-2018T22:10:37,JaydenMozingo,"Krita has the problem of, making strait lines"
26-02-2018T22:11:03,JaydenMozingo,And curved lines and filling tool
26-02-2018T22:11:45,JaydenMozingo,Layering is just fine on there. I wish Photo shop only had one payment to get it instead on monthly
26-02-2018T22:12:07,BadFoMo,What is propper layering?
26-02-2018T22:12:19,JaydenMozingo,Because I would rather not pay money for something that I'm almost never home to do
26-02-2018T22:12:46,JaydenMozingo,Gimp's layering just merges everything for me.
26-02-2018T22:13:12,BadFoMo,How so?
26-02-2018T22:13:16,JaydenMozingo,I put Blue screen behind Red screen. Gimp makes gray

26-02-2018T22:13:44,JaydenMozingo,I honestly don't know why. It just doesn't like me.

26-02-2018T22:16:46,CrRAR,Well then count me guilty for being afraid of stupid.

26-02-2018T22:18:38,JaydenMozingo,"Wait,  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI4-HUn8dFc"
26-02-2018T22:18:50,CrRAR,Kinda the same thing with video games all the glitches and cheat codes are lootboxes and buyables :(
26-02-2018T22:19:07,JaydenMozingo,"That, you guys should listen to. It's a series of synthwave 80's music"
26-02-2018T22:19:22,CrRAR,wow

26-02-2018T22:21:12,JaydenMozingo,I could repeat the video for 3 hours
26-02-2018T22:22:07,JaydenMozingo,"Hmm... One of my math problems says that ""Keith opens a savings account and puts $6800 in"""
26-02-2018T22:22:14,CrRAR,XD
26-02-2018T22:22:16,JaydenMozingo,Keith got them $$$'s

26-02-2018T22:23:23,TheBeckoner,He's probably got more money than that tbh.
26-02-2018T22:24:19,JaydenMozingo,He probably bought him a magic carpet... I want a ride on it with this music
26-02-2018T22:24:33,CrRAR,mmmm

26-02-2018T22:31:00,TheBeckoner,A clean 1970 Chevy C10 shortbed truck.
26-02-2018T22:31:38,JaydenMozingo,That's smexy. just searched it
26-02-2018T22:32:06,JaydenMozingo,I'd probably have a 1970 model Dodge Ram 1500
26-02-2018T22:32:13,JaydenMozingo,If I got the year right
26-02-2018T22:32:44,wolfspartan1,grand torino

26-02-2018T22:34:02,JaydenMozingo,I'd have a 1970 model Dodge Ram 1500
26-02-2018T22:34:03,TheBeckoner,That would be a D100 or 150 Jay. Still anice truck though.
26-02-2018T22:34:08,JaydenMozingo,If I got the year right
26-02-2018T22:34:29,JaydenMozingo,Damn it. pressed ctrl v
26-02-2018T22:35:04,JaydenMozingo,My brother got one. It has the nicest blue I will ever see on a truck
26-02-2018T22:35:38,JaydenMozingo,Pretty...
26-02-2018T22:37:10,JaydenMozingo,Might even be my first truck in a couple years
26-02-2018T22:40:24,JaydenMozingo,Ah. Cold temps out.
26-02-2018T22:44:57,JaydenMozingo,"Hey Tom, what vehicular device do you occupy?"
26-02-2018T22:45:17,TheBeckoner,I like the way that is worded.
26-02-2018T22:45:32,JaydenMozingo,Thank you
26-02-2018T22:57:26,JaydenMozingo,"I want to explore Newton's 1st law of motion the homestyle way. I will need trash bags in sheet form, a couple of broom sticks, a life vest, and a ride to the top of the burj khalifa."
26-02-2018T22:57:56,TheBeckoner,wot
26-02-2018T22:57:57,JaydenMozingo,I'm gonna fall in aerodynamic action
26-02-2018T22:58:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I have hot chocolate
26-02-2018T22:58:53,JaydenMozingo,Then probably get flipped off by those two brothers with jet packs
26-02-2018T22:59:05,TheBeckoner,Share?
26-02-2018T22:59:16,JaydenMozingo,I seen their inventions... I'm jealous
26-02-2018T22:59:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Too far away

26-02-2018T23:00:30,TheBeckoner,See yah
26-02-2018T23:02:00,NightMeaty22,Hello
26-02-2018T23:02:26,TheBeckoner,Hello Meat
26-02-2018T23:02:42,NightMeaty22,How are you beck
26-02-2018T23:07:56,NightMeaty22,Ok bye...
26-02-2018T23:25:24,SpazztasticKiwi,And it looks like I’m missing tomorrow’s stream 😐
26-02-2018T23:26:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Why did I decide to do night shifts again?
26-02-2018T23:26:56,TheBeckoner,"I got distracted. Im doing well, you?"
26-02-2018T23:27:09,TheBeckoner,And to make more money I assume spazz?
26-02-2018T23:27:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Too late they gone
26-02-2018T23:27:24,TheBeckoner,IT seems they aare.
26-02-2018T23:27:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m paid the same no matter the shift. I just chose nights because my sister does day shifts
26-02-2018T23:28:21,SpazztasticKiwi,And I can watch my usual YouTube whenever I want since it’s not really a live theng
26-02-2018T23:28:26,SpazztasticKiwi,*thing
26-02-2018T23:29:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless one of them decides to do a 2:00 a.m. Q&A
26-02-2018T23:29:34,TheBeckoner,Now yah gotta reschedule around the TK streams!
26-02-2018T23:29:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Or at least try to
26-02-2018T23:30:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I only tend to miss about an hour or so though
26-02-2018T23:32:03,TheBeckoner,Yeah I try to keep time set aside for them. I guess not too much would change since I just recently started watching them.
26-02-2018T23:32:22,TheBeckoner,"Been reading the comic for years, just never new about the streams."
26-02-2018T23:32:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll adapt; not too worried about that. I have been thinking about my friend’s little sister though - she’s been “in-and-out of the hospital” sick
26-02-2018T23:36:31,SpazztasticKiwi,And thinking about my trip to Seán’s show in March
26-02-2018T23:36:56,TheBeckoner,Busy schedule it seems? School too?
26-02-2018T23:37:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Won’t start school back till I move after April
26-02-2018T23:37:42,TheBeckoner,Ah I see.
26-02-2018T23:37:50,TheBeckoner,What are you studying?
26-02-2018T23:38:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Animation/graphic design
26-02-2018T23:38:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Didn’t want to be in the middle of moving before going on vacay to PAX
26-02-2018T23:39:55,TheBeckoner,That's understandable. I recently moved. Did it during the summer and it was a pain. Are you moving far?
26-02-2018T23:40:27,SpazztasticKiwi,2 hours from home
26-02-2018T23:41:15,TheBeckoner,Ooh so that's sorta far.
26-02-2018T23:41:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"I originally wanted LA, but they expensive and just a tad far (literally across the country)"
26-02-2018T23:42:06,TheBeckoner,lol yeah pretty far
26-02-2018T23:42:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"My mom thought I wanted LA because a certain YouTuber lives there. But nah, I’d just like a little breathing room from “smother” of the year"
26-02-2018T23:42:35,TheBeckoner,Im good in Texas. Maybe we could have more stable weather...but otherwise its nice.
26-02-2018T23:42:47,TheBeckoner,Smother lol
26-02-2018T23:43:19,TheBeckoner,"I get that. parents can get on your nerves, especially when your trying do your own adult things."
26-02-2018T23:48:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"If I seem slow to respond, I’m having another conversation with my Atlanta trip buddy"
