26-10-2018T00:00:08,unsteddyphoenix,hey that could be cool
26-10-2018T00:00:18,unsteddyphoenix,If it's 10 minutes of plot and an hour of monster killing
26-10-2018T00:00:19,unsteddyphoenix,I'd watch that
26-10-2018T00:00:26,Mihari,Game to movie don't have a great track record.
26-10-2018T00:00:28,Bgrmystr2,It's Hollywood though.
26-10-2018T00:00:36,Bgrmystr2,"yeah exactly, what mihari said"
26-10-2018T00:00:36,Twokinds,"Okay! 1am, I think that's good enough for me."
26-10-2018T00:00:39,unsteddyphoenix,Depends on the budget

26-10-2018T00:05:19,Combak,"Oh, is that your Nora card or something Ease?"
26-10-2018T00:05:38,Combak,"BTW, thanks Ord. XD"
26-10-2018T00:05:45,CrRAR,He was the suggester I think
26-10-2018T00:05:47,Ordithus,"By the sound of it, MarshallMelon's card"
26-10-2018T00:05:47,unsteddyphoenix,Its a wgute dress?

26-10-2018T00:05:59,unsteddyphoenix,white*
26-10-2018T00:06:00,Bgrmystr2,based on what the text said
26-10-2018T00:06:01,MrEase,"technically, since Tom's working on it I should be able to talk about it, but because of all the sketch requests I used to do, Marsh asked me if there was anything I wanted carded"
26-10-2018T00:06:13,MrEase,and so I asked for this and he said sure
26-10-2018T00:06:23,CrRAR,aww what a bro
26-10-2018T00:06:31,MrEase,Marsh is the MVP

26-10-2018T00:25:38,unsteddyphoenix,gnight man
26-10-2018T00:25:52,Bgrmystr2,Sage may have bled on the tablet.
26-10-2018T00:25:55,Bgrmystr2,Perhaps.
26-10-2018T00:25:57,Bgrmystr2,Before he leftt
26-10-2018T00:26:13,Bgrmystr2,He should be fine.
26-10-2018T00:26:26,Bgrmystr2,..probably. :ptv-wondering:
26-10-2018T00:27:06,Kynum,I didn't know he bled blood. I thought it was all just comics in there.
26-10-2018T00:28:33,SageSaga,baack
26-10-2018T00:28:35,Bgrmystr2,Of course he bleeds blood. How do you think he wrote brb?
26-10-2018T00:28:36,SageSaga,sorry took so long
26-10-2018T00:28:39,Ordithus,wb
26-10-2018T00:28:46,Kynum,"oh, right."
26-10-2018T00:28:47,Bgrmystr2,"speaking of which, welcome back"
26-10-2018T00:29:37,unsteddyphoenix,wb~
26-10-2018T00:33:38,Ordithus,":ctwokinds-natanisleep: Nighty night.  Thanks for the stream, probably will join tomorrow"

26-10-2018T00:33:59,unsteddyphoenix,gnight Ord~
26-10-2018T00:34:10,SageSaga,i have a Party to go to - and i gotta be back before DnD time
26-10-2018T00:34:13,Bgrmystr2,gnight ord
26-10-2018T00:34:21,Bgrmystr2,alright sage
26-10-2018T00:34:31,Bgrmystr2,how short you think..?
26-10-2018T00:35:12,Bgrmystr2,I may be later than usual cuz there's guests coming by. But I don't think I need to do anything for it.. not sure.
26-10-2018T00:35:13,SageSaga,might start early
26-10-2018T00:35:36,SageSaga,i gotta leave before 5pm to make it on time
26-10-2018T00:35:51,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock:
26-10-2018T00:35:53,SageSaga,so if i start at 2:30 i will end at 4:30
26-10-2018T00:36:38,Bgrmystr2,hmm I'll see if I can make it. Guests are coming around when you end tho so dunno if I'll sleep through stream xD
26-10-2018T00:36:53,Bgrmystr2,I'll try not to
26-10-2018T00:37:31,SageSaga,np
26-10-2018T00:38:18,ZRO4825,"I'm stuck at work an hour before even that start time, lol"
26-10-2018T00:38:24,Bgrmystr2,"speaking of streams, what day is your bday so I know to not plan for things :thinking:"
26-10-2018T00:38:32,ZRO4825,Same day as mine :3
26-10-2018T00:38:53,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-unimpressed: ..yes that's very helpful
26-10-2018T00:38:54,SageSaga,Nov 24th
26-10-2018T00:39:00,Bgrmystr2,thanks :O
26-10-2018T00:40:06,Bgrmystr2,"wait, so that's a saturday"
26-10-2018T00:40:11,Bgrmystr2,you would have been streaming that day anyway
26-10-2018T00:40:19,Bgrmystr2,for coloring your comic
26-10-2018T00:40:36,ZRO4825,lol
26-10-2018T00:41:21,SageSaga,yeah
26-10-2018T00:41:47,SageSaga,thus why i will be streaming on my birthday
26-10-2018T00:41:57,ZRO4825,:csagesaga-c3:
26-10-2018T00:43:47,Bgrmystr2,"Oh, I thought you meant you'd be streaming because it's your birthday, not really based on what day it was"
26-10-2018T00:44:27,SageSaga,that was the joke
26-10-2018T00:44:49,SageSaga,but no one at the time asked what day my birthday was
26-10-2018T00:44:53,SageSaga,so no one got the punchline
26-10-2018T00:45:02,Bgrmystr2,OH xD goddamnit
26-10-2018T00:45:06,ZRO4825,I didn't wanna give it away :3
26-10-2018T00:45:12,Bgrmystr2,:C now I feel bad
26-10-2018T00:47:34,SageSaga,when i wanna feel bad - i just remember that they are making a Monster Hunter live action movie AND a My Hero Academia Live action movie
26-10-2018T00:48:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,My hero what now?
26-10-2018T00:48:43,SageSaga,it's written in text so you dont need me to repeat it
26-10-2018T00:48:55,Bgrmystr2,"I'm actually curious. What do you think of of the Battle Angel Alita movie they're gonna be releasing, Sage?"
26-10-2018T00:49:00,Bgrmystr2,Same thoughts?
26-10-2018T00:49:26,SageSaga,Battle Angel doesnt look that bad really- the eyes are creepy - sure- but shes an android
26-10-2018T00:49:33,RimaDraws,i like how it looks
26-10-2018T00:50:15,SageSaga,it looks like it is a faithful recreation too
26-10-2018T00:50:41,DarthRexKing,YEs it does. o3o
26-10-2018T00:51:18,Bgrmystr2,"I haven't seen the original, but I plan to before watching the movie"
26-10-2018T00:51:48,Bgrmystr2,I'm just hesitent cuz it looks great but.. track record not great.
26-10-2018T00:52:02,SageSaga,the MH movie though is by the same people who did all the Resident Evil movies though =_=
26-10-2018T00:52:34,Bgrmystr2,those I didn't see so..
26-10-2018T00:52:39,Bgrmystr2,dunno :/
26-10-2018T00:53:04,SageSaga,they were awful
26-10-2018T01:02:09,SageSaga,oh but there is a CG animated movie based on Monster Hunter coming out too
26-10-2018T01:02:14,SageSaga,that im interested in seeing
26-10-2018T01:03:17,SageSaga,oh- before the stream today- Mihari and i completed the weekly bounties for MHW in under an hour XD
26-10-2018T01:03:40,Bgrmystr2,hm
26-10-2018T01:03:51,Bgrmystr2,I don't play the game so I don't know if that's fast or not
26-10-2018T01:05:55,SageSaga,playing Duo's is one of the hardest ways to play the game- and we had to do 4 tempered (harder than normal) Azure Rathalos'
26-10-2018T01:08:47,SageSaga,Monsters in MHW get 2.6x more HP when you do multiplayer regardless of how many players of the max 4- so by adding one player its just as hard as if you had 4 players
26-10-2018T01:10:17,Bgrmystr2,hm
26-10-2018T01:10:17,SageSaga,so the easiest way to play is Solo
26-10-2018T01:10:35,Princessnapped,"or with 4 people, I think"
26-10-2018T01:10:38,Princessnapped,but that one's hard to set up
26-10-2018T01:11:19,SageSaga,4 isnt as easy because they also gain higher resistances to things like stun and statuses
26-10-2018T01:11:33,Princessnapped,"ah yeah, i forgot tempered monsters build resisatnce to stuff like that"
26-10-2018T01:11:37,Princessnapped,iirc the non-tempered ones don't
26-10-2018T01:11:40,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
26-10-2018T01:12:12,SageSaga,so with the right build i can almost stun lock a monster if i play it just right
26-10-2018T01:12:39,SageSaga,and with the lower HP its super easy to finish em quick- im not a speed runner but i killed a Tempered Teostra in 4:25
26-10-2018T01:14:40,SageSaga,Tempered ones only build resistance to flashes and screamers- and im not actually sure about screamers - i dont fight enough tempered Diablos' to try
26-10-2018T01:15:07,Princessnapped,"ah, yeah, I was thinking of flash bombs mainly"
26-10-2018T01:15:23,Princessnapped,because I played with a friend and we were trying to fight an tempered rathalos but eventually we couldn't down it
26-10-2018T01:15:31,Princessnapped,"which was awful for us since I'm a hammer main and she was an GS main, haha"
26-10-2018T01:15:38,Princessnapped,"we eventually got it, but, yeah."
26-10-2018T01:16:11,SageSaga,i use almost all the weapons but i love the bow in MHW
26-10-2018T01:16:21,Princessnapped,"i like it too! hammer's my favorite though, and I love bowgun too"
26-10-2018T01:16:30,Princessnapped,"i'm not a very good player; I'm more of just casual, but it's a really fun game"
26-10-2018T01:16:31,ZRO4825,Charge Blade! ^_^
26-10-2018T01:16:35,Princessnapped,ooh!
26-10-2018T01:16:36,ZRO4825,And Great Sword <3
26-10-2018T01:18:05,SageSaga,"only weapons i havent used a lot now are - Insect Glaive, Longsword, and Hunting horn"
26-10-2018T01:18:20,unsteddyphoenix,Insect glaive is so fun~
26-10-2018T01:18:23,unsteddyphoenix,Flying around everywhere
26-10-2018T01:18:39,ZRO4825,I have one weapon I have never touched so far.
26-10-2018T01:18:43,ZRO4825,Lance :rofl:
26-10-2018T01:18:53,SageSaga,I love Lance
26-10-2018T01:19:05,SageSaga,gunlance in MHW kinda sucks though
26-10-2018T01:19:11,ZRO4825,Really? I kinda like it.
26-10-2018T01:19:22,SageSaga,it's so boring
26-10-2018T01:19:43,SageSaga,"""Stab - Blast Blast Blast - reload - repeat"""
26-10-2018T01:19:47,ZRO4825,Now THAT I can't really argue...
26-10-2018T01:20:21,SageSaga,the only part that is fun is when the monster gets knocked out or over or slept and you get to use the wyvern fire on its face
26-10-2018T01:20:30,ZRO4825,>=D
26-10-2018T01:21:23,SageSaga,however- the Deviljho lance with full guard and guard up- is god tier - invulnerable and deadly- and fast- sorta XD
26-10-2018T01:21:39,SageSaga,they have a mod so when you do the lance charge it played that song from Initial D
26-10-2018T01:21:45,ZRO4825,XD
26-10-2018T01:22:43,SageSaga,Mods are awesome btw- so long as you arent using cheat mods and just using visual mods
26-10-2018T01:23:07,SageSaga,Mihari and I have been hunting wearing the Halloween Handler Dress
26-10-2018T01:23:09,Bgrmystr2,"""That song from Initial D"" which one lol"
26-10-2018T01:23:29,Bgrmystr2,That one particular eurobeat song? :P
26-10-2018T01:23:57,SageSaga,Deja Ju
26-10-2018T01:24:02,Bgrmystr2,Ah that one
26-10-2018T01:24:11,Princessnapped,"yeah, visual ones are great. i'm just worried about possibly getting banned so I stopped using the one that changed the button images to the ps4 ones"
26-10-2018T01:24:29,Bgrmystr2,Yeah Deja vu is probably one of the most popular songs from that anime.
26-10-2018T01:25:23,SageSaga,they are very very very unlikely to ban anyone for using visual mods because they only work for those who have the mod
26-10-2018T01:25:48,Princessnapped,"yeah, it's just still an concern :S"
26-10-2018T01:25:58,SageSaga,but if you have a mod that changes your damage - or modifies a weapon to say- FIRE INFINITELY
26-10-2018T01:26:05,Princessnapped,"yea, that is soooo banned 100%"
26-10-2018T01:26:14,SageSaga,cept they have never banned anyone yet
26-10-2018T01:26:19,Princessnapped,"i'm thinking of one that like, shows you damage stuff? my friend had that too, it helped her capture things better"
26-10-2018T01:26:27,Princessnapped,"it didn't change anything, and only she could see it/use it"
26-10-2018T01:26:40,SageSaga,yeah those are fine too
26-10-2018T01:27:05,Princessnapped,"neato, I might have to grab that then, because I have a hard time telling if I can capture monsters yet or not or if I'm doing good at helping her take down stuff"
26-10-2018T01:27:09,Bgrmystr2,"those are all gonna be client-sided probably. The only affect your game, and they don't send any information to the game servers you're playing on."
26-10-2018T01:27:20,SageSaga,exactly
26-10-2018T01:27:26,Princessnapped,"yeah. But things like... the transmog, would, yeah?"
26-10-2018T01:27:41,Bgrmystr2,"the mods that change damage or speed or whatnot, those would send information to the servers, and that's what the company will be watching for."
26-10-2018T01:27:47,Princessnapped,ah!
26-10-2018T01:28:23,Bgrmystr2,what you see will be only changed to you. Noone else would see it
26-10-2018T01:28:36,Bgrmystr2,"otherwise, it'd affect EVERYONE"
26-10-2018T01:28:43,Bgrmystr2,"or least, everyone that"
26-10-2018T01:28:48,Bgrmystr2,everyone that's within reach of it*
26-10-2018T01:29:04,Bgrmystr2,though I'm sure that'd be noticed super quick xD
26-10-2018T01:29:09,ZRO4825,I've seen a vid where someone modded the size of the monsters.
26-10-2018T01:29:13,ZRO4825,ITTY BITTY DODOGAMA!!!

26-10-2018T01:32:10,SageSaga,we'll often go out using the same weapon builds but we both use that dress because its awesome
26-10-2018T01:32:16,ZRO4825,lol
26-10-2018T01:32:19,Princessnapped,it is!!
26-10-2018T01:32:26,SageSaga,if anyone joins us though they see us wearing the regular Halloween outfit- that looks stupid
26-10-2018T01:32:35,Princessnapped,"it really does, lol"
26-10-2018T01:32:42,Princessnapped,i hate the pumpkin butt
26-10-2018T01:33:07,SageSaga,though i am going to change the outfit in a bit to the new one that got released!

26-10-2018T01:36:24,SageSaga,and she had a thing for Brachydios
26-10-2018T01:37:09,Princessnapped,"to be fair, that thing has great color theory"
26-10-2018T01:37:17,Princessnapped,i've got one in Monster hunter Stories and omg it's so cute
26-10-2018T01:39:40,SageSaga,so cute

26-10-2018T01:43:54,SageSaga,oh-  i had to kill more Lavisioths in MHW- so i grabbed my lance and threw minds eye on it- take that you dumb lava covered monster
26-10-2018T01:45:00,ZRO4825,lol
26-10-2018T01:46:19,SageSaga,"he was like ""im gonna nuke you with this blast of EXPLODING LAVA! Whatcha gonna do about it?"" and i was like ""uh- block it"" ""oh- you - you can do that?"" ""Yes- *STAB*"""
26-10-2018T01:47:01,Princessnapped,"haha, oh my goodness"
26-10-2018T01:47:10,Princessnapped,"i hate fighting lavasioth too tho, so i don't blame you."
26-10-2018T01:47:23,ZRO4825,XD
26-10-2018T01:47:42,Princessnapped,"i and my friend call it the bastard fish, haha"
26-10-2018T01:48:36,SageSaga,im just glad plesioth isnt in the game
26-10-2018T01:50:37,SageSaga,"he was the size of a city bus, flailed around like an abnormal titan from Attack on Titan, and hit like a tank"
26-10-2018T01:51:42,Princessnapped,jeeze
26-10-2018T01:52:05,SageSaga,"his hip check attack was like ""Hey! Watch me drift this Greyhound bus!"""
26-10-2018T01:53:39,Bgrmystr2,"Hey, watching buses drift is some intense shit"

26-10-2018T01:58:38,Princessnapped,"reminds me of how nergie's hitbox was before they finally changed it, haha"
26-10-2018T02:00:14,SageSaga,i only had an issue with him in the Beta
26-10-2018T02:00:54,SageSaga,he's a joke with the lance build though XD
26-10-2018T02:01:20,SageSaga,"""oh no! hes gonna dive!"" *block and take nothing*"
26-10-2018T02:01:29,Princessnapped,yeah!!
26-10-2018T02:01:44,Princessnapped,"i feel bad when i have to bowgun these big monsters because I'm crap at fighting them, my friend has to carry me, haha"
26-10-2018T02:02:21,SageSaga,you can put a shield on the heavybow gun :P
26-10-2018T02:02:30,Princessnapped,O: that's a good idea
26-10-2018T02:02:37,Princessnapped,i usually use light bowgun but that's a good idea.
26-10-2018T02:04:54,SageSaga,here's an amazing speed run  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVjp0g63_pc
26-10-2018T02:08:30,SageSaga,that's how i use the bow but im not that perfect yet XD
26-10-2018T02:10:10,Princessnapped,jeez that's a hell of a speedrun.
26-10-2018T02:10:26,ZRO4825,I don't like watching MH speedruns. They make me feel inferior. :joy:
26-10-2018T02:10:58,SageSaga,they make me realize i can be better
26-10-2018T02:12:44,sunblaze,good morning
26-10-2018T02:12:59,SageSaga,hey Sunblaze
26-10-2018T02:13:57,Princessnapped,hi!
26-10-2018T02:15:46,Bgrmystr2,heya sun
26-10-2018T02:18:09,SageSaga,anyone know what the natural enemy of a Mime is?
26-10-2018T02:18:20,DarthRexKing,No.
26-10-2018T02:18:21,Princessnapped,a birthday party!
26-10-2018T02:18:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,nope
26-10-2018T02:18:42,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
26-10-2018T02:19:23,Bgrmystr2,I don't think I even want to look up the answer.
26-10-2018T02:20:37,SageSaga,we had to fight one in a Super hero game a couple weeks ago
26-10-2018T02:21:01,SageSaga,my character is the type to try and come up with clever ways to counter an enemies abilities
26-10-2018T02:21:18,unsteddyphoenix,ooh I love that answer
26-10-2018T02:21:19,SageSaga,but i was at a loss as to what the natural weakness or enemy of a mime was
26-10-2018T02:21:37,Bgrmystr2,haha subverted answer
26-10-2018T02:21:37,unsteddyphoenix,"As long as nobody looks at him, he cant hurt you!"
26-10-2018T02:22:03,Bgrmystr2,mime a box around him
26-10-2018T02:22:05,Bgrmystr2,or something
26-10-2018T02:22:11,Bgrmystr2,so he's trapped?
26-10-2018T02:22:31,SageSaga,his actual ability was to project force and teleport- so he could trap you in a box of force or pretend to open a door and teleport through it
26-10-2018T02:22:54,SageSaga,he could create telekinetic forces and shot someone with his finger
26-10-2018T02:23:17,Bgrmystr2,oh..kay.. that's actually legit cool
26-10-2018T02:23:17,sunblaze,that sounds like an awesome enemy :D
26-10-2018T02:23:26,sunblaze,all I get are zombies in a cagefight :D
26-10-2018T02:23:48,SageSaga,i defeated him but i was disappointed i couldnt come up with a more legit counter
26-10-2018T02:24:17,Bgrmystr2,I don't actually know.
26-10-2018T02:24:27,Bgrmystr2,I was expecting some kind of bad pun joke
26-10-2018T02:24:37,Bgrmystr2,was not expecting legit serious question lol
26-10-2018T02:25:16,sunblaze,expose him as a fraud in front of a crowd?
26-10-2018T02:25:24,Bgrmystr2,hm
26-10-2018T02:25:26,unsteddyphoenix,Force him to talk lol
26-10-2018T02:25:28,ZRO4825,Pants him.
26-10-2018T02:25:35,Bgrmystr2,yeah but how would you..
26-10-2018T02:25:37,Bgrmystr2,zro.
26-10-2018T02:25:39,SageSaga,i used intangibility and super speed to avoid his invisible walls- and popped out of the ground beneath him - upper cutted him right in the balls at mach 2
26-10-2018T02:25:39,sunblaze,basically all I can think is beeing REALLY mean and talk him down on a personal level.
26-10-2018T02:25:39,Bgrmystr2,zro why
26-10-2018T02:25:40,unsteddyphoenix,"If you trick him into talking, he loses all his power"
26-10-2018T02:25:43,ZRO4825,Clowns.
26-10-2018T02:25:43,Princessnapped,"same as bgrmy, haha"
26-10-2018T02:25:45,sunblaze,not a thing I like
26-10-2018T02:26:30,Bgrmystr2,so sage.. did he say anything?
26-10-2018T02:26:35,Bgrmystr2,did it make him speak
26-10-2018T02:26:39,Bgrmystr2,or at least make sounds
26-10-2018T02:26:55,Bgrmystr2,or did he crumple over as expected?
26-10-2018T02:27:00,SageSaga,he didnt make a sound- its possible he didnt have a voice box at all
26-10-2018T02:27:07,Bgrmystr2,"oh,"
26-10-2018T02:27:07,DarthRexKing,"Goodnight everyone, oh and the powderpuff girls solution to defeating a mime is rock music."
26-10-2018T02:27:15,DarthRexKing,powerpuff
26-10-2018T02:27:16,SageSaga,he flew 35 feet into the air though
26-10-2018T02:27:16,Bgrmystr2,well okay
26-10-2018T02:27:41,DarthRexKing,Later everyone.
26-10-2018T02:27:46,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, he could be the type of person that doesn't make a noise when they get seriously injured"
26-10-2018T02:27:46,SageSaga,take carte
26-10-2018T02:27:49,SageSaga,care*
26-10-2018T02:27:49,Bgrmystr2,seeya drex
26-10-2018T02:28:21,Bgrmystr2,those ppl are fairly bad to keep around.. they don't drop noise flags if something bad happens.
26-10-2018T02:28:36,Bgrmystr2,..and I am one of those people. :ptv-uneasy:
26-10-2018T02:29:14,SageSaga,the first villain we fought used sonic attacks and barriers
26-10-2018T02:29:40,DarthRexKing,*Takes Sage's advice and rides cart to bed.* o3o
26-10-2018T02:29:45,DarthRexKing,*Waves.* :3
26-10-2018T02:29:50,SageSaga,so i got some giant speakers and set them up around him- and reversed the frequency on him
26-10-2018T02:30:05,Bgrmystr2,ah yeah I remember you telling us about that
26-10-2018T02:30:10,SageSaga,so i noise cancelled him
26-10-2018T02:30:25,SageSaga,this past week we had to deal with a really powerful shadow creature
26-10-2018T02:30:56,SageSaga,he almost took out half the party so i went with my strongest non physical attack- and generated a bolt of lightning
26-10-2018T02:32:14,SageSaga,problem was he had been absorbing all the attacks that came at him before- so i assumed he absorbed physical damage- so i tried an energy- he absorbed that too- but not all of it- so it really hurt him
26-10-2018T02:32:57,SageSaga,but he launched it back at me too- i had to use a soak to avoid the damage
26-10-2018T02:33:29,SageSaga,from then on it was just about holding him off till help could arrive
26-10-2018T02:34:39,SageSaga,finally one of the top tier heroes showed up on scene to finish him off
26-10-2018T02:38:44,SageSaga,it was a little weird because it felt like i was the only one doing anything- but thats probably because i built my character to be high utility- and i can use tricks to pull off huge damage moves
26-10-2018T02:38:59,Bgrmystr2,don't.. you usually do colors and stuff on saturday?
26-10-2018T02:39:11,ZRO4825,Indeed. But he has to shorten his stream tomorrow
26-10-2018T02:39:11,Bgrmystr2,guessing cuz you have less time tomorrow
26-10-2018T02:39:14,Bgrmystr2,yeah
26-10-2018T02:39:16,Bgrmystr2,I was thinkin that
26-10-2018T02:39:26,SageSaga,"so the super strong guy on our team was like ""I cant hurt him"" and the Mater control people were like ""We are basically super strenght too-"""
26-10-2018T02:39:35,SageSaga,yep- less time tomorrow
26-10-2018T02:39:49,SageSaga,im just doing flats
26-10-2018T02:39:56,Bgrmystr2,Yeah I figured
26-10-2018T02:40:46,Bgrmystr2,I was gonna go eat when you finished but then you kept goin and kept goin and I couldn't figure out what was different
26-10-2018T02:41:28,sunblaze,^don't forget to eat!

26-10-2018T13:48:44,SageSaga,"another was about 2 priestesses, a skilled one and her meek younger sister that went to exorcise a den of spirits"

26-10-2018T22:16:16,Bgrmystr2,then yeah I'd eat taco bell
26-10-2018T22:16:19,Bgrmystr2,even if I didn't want it
26-10-2018T22:16:22,Ordithus,You speak of why I'm not above PB&J
26-10-2018T22:17:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe not burritos but they have nachos
26-10-2018T22:17:45,ZephyrTWolffox,14 hour shift here

26-10-2018T22:19:08,ZephyrTWolffox,I still love how there is lit always SOMEONE on this channel 100% of the time
26-10-2018T22:19:26,Bgrmystr2,"Yes, aren't timezones great"
26-10-2018T22:19:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Some of us have no life too so there’s that

26-10-2018T22:21:29,Bgrmystr2,also an acceptable alternative.
26-10-2018T22:24:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Closed
26-10-2018T22:25:52,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-LauraCry:
26-10-2018T22:26:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m just gonna go grab some chicken pot pies
26-10-2018T22:26:27,Ordithus,Best choice
26-10-2018T22:29:14,CommanderTrace,I'm going to sleep now good night or good morning depending on what time it is for you right now:joy::ptv-greetings::ptv-sleepy:
26-10-2018T22:29:43,Ordithus,night Trace
26-10-2018T22:29:52,CommanderTrace,thx
26-10-2018T22:55:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Wonder if Tom ever got to get RDR2
26-10-2018T23:03:18,BadFoMo,What?
26-10-2018T23:06:17,Ordithus,Red Dead Redemption 2
26-10-2018T23:08:23,Dadrobit,Literally playing that right now.
26-10-2018T23:08:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,any good?
26-10-2018T23:08:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark’s apparently doing a series
26-10-2018T23:08:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Pretty
26-10-2018T23:08:55,Dadrobit,"Solid game. Stunning visuals, but it has some cumbersome mechanics."
26-10-2018T23:09:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I saw on twitter Oney is not a fan of the gunplay
26-10-2018T23:09:24,Dadrobit,Like how the main character stows away his weapons every time he gets on his horse.
26-10-2018T23:09:49,Dadrobit,"Also, I have a problem with some of the pop up prompts."
26-10-2018T23:10:01,Dadrobit,"Like, it says ""L2 draw weapon"""
26-10-2018T23:10:22,Dadrobit,"And I hit the button, but instead of just drawing the weapon, it immediately fires it."
26-10-2018T23:10:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah I can see Mark having fun with it since he’s not a console person
26-10-2018T23:10:37,Dadrobit,"Suddenly, I have a dead shopkeep on my hands..."
26-10-2018T23:10:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Opps
26-10-2018T23:10:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,eek
26-10-2018T23:11:10,SpazztasticKiwi,“ I didn’t do that. He was dead when I got here”
26-10-2018T23:11:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,sounds like a me quote XD
26-10-2018T23:12:00,EggRollss,Hey
26-10-2018T23:12:16,Dadrobit,"That explosion, it was the farting spiders, I swear."
26-10-2018T23:12:29,Dadrobit,Barking Spiders*
26-10-2018T23:12:34,EggRollss,?
26-10-2018T23:12:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Honestly farting spiders sounds better
26-10-2018T23:12:54,Ordithus,farting spiders :ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake:
26-10-2018T23:12:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Or at least more entertaining
26-10-2018T23:13:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,farting spiders would be a nightmare
26-10-2018T23:14:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"“Did you fart, man?” “No, did you?” *panic ensues as they search for the 8 legged culprit*"
26-10-2018T23:14:04,Dadrobit,"Just looked up this ""oney"" folk on Twitter. Yeah, the opening act does suck some serious balls as well."
26-10-2018T23:14:46,Dadrobit,Having to trudge slowly through the snow gets boring reaaaal quick.
26-10-2018T23:15:17,Ordithus,but it looks cool
26-10-2018T23:15:52,SpazztasticKiwi,“I spy with my little eye something white” “If you say that again I’m going to shoot you”
26-10-2018T23:15:53,Dadrobit,"Once it gets past the first chapter the game opens up hugely, but man. That first chapter made me real cautious."
26-10-2018T23:16:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Exposition bomb?
26-10-2018T23:16:42,Dadrobit,It's just slow.
26-10-2018T23:17:28,Dadrobit,"Everyone's down in the dumps, you can't move faster than a walk, and it took me well over an hour to get through. MAybe even 2+."
26-10-2018T23:17:42,Dadrobit,Or at least it sure felt like 2+.
26-10-2018T23:19:14,Dadrobit,"And the aforementioned cumbersome mechanics that are there for immersion's sake, sure doesn't help."
26-10-2018T23:22:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,so.... wait till after a few patches then
26-10-2018T23:24:14,Dadrobit,"They're not bugs, they're features."
26-10-2018T23:26:45,SpazztasticKiwi,*cowboy voice* I smell horse shite
26-10-2018T23:31:52,Ordithus,you might want to watch your step
26-10-2018T23:33:59,Dadrobit,"Nah, not even joking, they're features."
26-10-2018T23:34:16,RimaDraws,hi dad
26-10-2018T23:34:23,Dadrobit,"Like him putting away everything but his pistol on his horse, they actively animate him putting them away."
26-10-2018T23:34:26,Dadrobit,Hey Rima!
26-10-2018T23:34:41,RimaDraws,o/
26-10-2018T23:35:59,Dadrobit,And it gets kind of annoying when I have to jump off my horse real quick to take on bandits/bounty hunters and all I've got is my pistol unless I walk back up to my horse (which can get shot and perma-die) and navigate the menus to take my weapons back.
26-10-2018T23:37:20,Ordithus,well you gotta remember to grab your guns
26-10-2018T23:38:13,Dadrobit,"Or, ya know, he could just leave the rifle slung across his back, slung across his back?"
26-10-2018T23:38:26,RimaDraws,red dead?
26-10-2018T23:38:31,Dadrobit,Yepper
26-10-2018T23:38:38,RimaDraws,oh yea that games a betch
26-10-2018T23:38:41,RimaDraws,good game
26-10-2018T23:38:45,RimaDraws,just some things
26-10-2018T23:39:15,Dadrobit,"Yeah, honestly still a good game, but it does have its fair share of bugbears."
26-10-2018T23:39:36,RimaDraws,i bet
26-10-2018T23:44:04,Dadrobit,"Ahhh, just saw the Patreon post, Magpie, now there's a throwback."
26-10-2018T23:44:11,Dadrobit,I wonder what the exact request was?
26-10-2018T23:44:13,RimaDraws,yea shes cute
26-10-2018T23:44:26,Ordithus,totes adorbs
26-10-2018T23:45:25,Ordithus,"Probably ""Return of Magpie the Merchant (and her shop)"""
26-10-2018T23:45:36,Ordithus,It was in the votes for the last sunday stream
26-10-2018T23:45:56,Dadrobit,Thanks for the find.
26-10-2018T23:46:13,Dadrobit,Don't think I was here for the last votable Sunday?
26-10-2018T23:46:39,RimaDraws,there was no stream
26-10-2018T23:46:53,Ordithus,"This week, but there was one the week before"
26-10-2018T23:47:27,Dadrobit,That's what I was saying. This past week was unvotable. And I don't think I was here for the one before that.
26-10-2018T23:48:30,RimaDraws,his power went out and we had 15 anni stuff
26-10-2018T23:49:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Wonder if luck be with him tomorrow
26-10-2018T23:49:07,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I was here last Sunday, actually cut out of work just to see it lol."
26-10-2018T23:49:22,Dadrobit,Ended up not catching much of anything.
26-10-2018T23:49:26,Ordithus,oh yeah... that happened
26-10-2018T23:49:35,RimaDraws,so my cat ended up scaring me earlier
26-10-2018T23:49:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Awwww
26-10-2018T23:49:53,RimaDraws,he has this blue fuzzy ball he plays with
26-10-2018T23:50:21,RimaDraws,and he was carrying it in his mouth earlier and i seriously thought for a moment with his black fur reflecting off it it looked like a giant spider
26-10-2018T23:50:31,Dadrobit,Also interesting to note that Tom seems to have updated the original Magpie sketches for this.
26-10-2018T23:50:33,RimaDraws,i about had a heart attack and my heart stopped for a couple mins
26-10-2018T23:50:41,RimaDraws,Magpie <3
26-10-2018T23:50:52,Dadrobit,Original https://i.imgur.com/Se1myED.png
26-10-2018T23:51:05,Dadrobit,Updated https://i.imgur.com/ry2Jmzu.jpg
26-10-2018T23:51:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,The updated one has been around for a good minute now
26-10-2018T23:51:36,Dadrobit,Has it now?
26-10-2018T23:51:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"yeah, it showed up a few times with roberto bot"
26-10-2018T23:52:23,Dadrobit,TIL
26-10-2018T23:53:08,Ordithus,"Yeah, I know I've seen that sketch before"
26-10-2018T23:53:38,Dadrobit,I am of the bad at this it would seem.
26-10-2018T23:54:16,RimaDraws,ooh
26-10-2018T23:56:14,Ordithus,Seems she's from a period after the current comic events
26-10-2018T23:56:40,Ordithus,"Tom said she tells (inaccurate) stories about her ""artifacts"""
26-10-2018T23:57:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Someone dishonest in Tom’s comics? Never
26-10-2018T23:57:52,Ordithus,"Dunno if she's really dishonest, or just got it wrong"
26-10-2018T23:58:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,gets hyped in telling the story she just goes on a roll
