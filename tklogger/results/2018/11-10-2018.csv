11-10-2018T18:45:19,Xexanoth,"pretty much any social site i go to uses ""for academic purposes"" when asking for perv stuff"
11-10-2018T18:45:46,Twokinds,Yeah

11-10-2018T20:28:41,CrRAR,*it'd
11-10-2018T20:28:55,SageSaga,i did make sure they have the video first though
11-10-2018T20:29:02,SageSaga,so i can still buy it from them
11-10-2018T20:29:11,CrRAR,\o/
11-10-2018T20:29:26,SageSaga,just sucks buying something twice when theres an option not to
11-10-2018T20:29:36,CrRAR,yeah
11-10-2018T20:29:47,Bgrmystr2,why not just contact support...?
11-10-2018T20:30:15,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, if it doesn't work, but your code is valid, it's something you can talk to them about :u"
11-10-2018T20:30:19,Nekonny,probabl y not worth the time?
11-10-2018T20:30:19,SageSaga,its not something support can deal with
11-10-2018T20:31:40,Combak,"Hey Marv, Ord."
11-10-2018T20:31:51,ZRO4825,:musical_note: A pox on the phoney king of England.
11-10-2018T20:31:53,Bgrmystr2,"I don't really see why not, but it's your call :u"
11-10-2018T20:31:56,Bgrmystr2,Heya Zro
11-10-2018T20:32:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Zro
11-10-2018T20:32:08,ZRO4825,Hiyas ^_^
11-10-2018T20:32:08,Ordithus,Hi ZRO
11-10-2018T20:32:22,SageSaga,if a type of bar-code is not supported then what would they do?
11-10-2018T20:32:49,Ordithus,They could just give you a discount code or something
11-10-2018T20:32:51,SageSaga,"my guess is say ""Sorry but your copy of the movie is not a supported version for conversion"""
11-10-2018T20:33:41,Bgrmystr2,"the barcodes all have a source, don't they? They can verify the one you got and get a discount code or whatnot like Ord said"
11-10-2018T20:33:53,Nekonny,who would make the better AI waifu; alexa or cortana?
11-10-2018T20:33:56,Nekonny,or shu
11-10-2018T20:34:06,SageSaga,none of them
11-10-2018T20:34:10,CrRAR,haha
11-10-2018T20:34:12,Bgrmystr2,I'd vote May
11-10-2018T20:34:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
11-10-2018T20:34:16,Bgrmystr2,but that's just me
11-10-2018T20:35:32,CrRAR,cortana in the halo fiction is at least based on a real person.
11-10-2018T20:35:45,Nekonny,may?
11-10-2018T20:35:46,SageSaga,im sure if i called and made a fuss about it i could get some kinda discount- but then i'd have to be one of those dicks that does that crap and i would waste a bunch of my time
11-10-2018T20:35:55,Bgrmystr2,"yeah May, from Hand Maid May :v"
11-10-2018T20:36:00,Nekonny,ah XD

11-10-2018T20:36:57,CrRAR,At least you might be in for a fun evening of SCIENCE!
11-10-2018T20:37:05,Bgrmystr2,exactly.. it ends with science.
11-10-2018T20:37:07,Bgrmystr2,You monster.

11-10-2018T20:38:21,Bgrmystr2,It was not lie! It was just..
11-10-2018T20:38:27,Ordithus,"She does what she must, because she can"
11-10-2018T20:38:27,Bgrmystr2,really really.. far away.

11-10-2018T22:13:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Have good noms
11-10-2018T22:22:29,Bgrmystr2,Having dadro on the mic to listen to it would be good cuz He'd know if it were cutting in or out or what it was doing.. I should do that sometime within a few days. Not expecting to do it anytime this weekend since tom stream sat and tom/fluff stream sun
11-10-2018T22:22:35,Bgrmystr2,..that's not a whisper.
11-10-2018T22:22:38,Bgrmystr2,thanks picarto

11-10-2018T22:22:54,Ordithus,At least it wasn't something embarassing
11-10-2018T22:23:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,picarto has claimed another victim
11-10-2018T22:23:29,Bgrmystr2,still wondering when they're gonna fix that.
11-10-2018T22:24:09,SageSaga,not sure how picarto can ever fix user error
11-10-2018T22:24:23,Bgrmystr2,that's not user error

11-10-2018T22:24:33,Bgrmystr2,and it just goes into all chat
11-10-2018T22:24:51,Bgrmystr2,I press enter and the whisper just doesn't happen.
11-10-2018T22:26:10,SageSaga,"I know, it's never happened to me either. Anyways, love you too mom, cya tomorrow."
11-10-2018T22:26:21,SageSaga,oh crap- you're right- they need to fix that

11-10-2018T22:37:03,SageSaga,huh- i guess its already time to move on to AI
11-10-2018T22:37:15,SageSaga,because none of these sketch people have gotten back to me
11-10-2018T22:38:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,why they so lazy
11-10-2018T22:39:10,SageSaga,i got to play in an RPG this week
11-10-2018T22:39:43,SageSaga,thats not a reason- that's a different subject
11-10-2018T22:39:51,Ordithus,Instead of DM'ing?
11-10-2018T22:40:02,SageSaga,yeah i DM the Saturday game
11-10-2018T22:40:12,SageSaga,but i got to play with my local friends yesterday
11-10-2018T22:40:23,BadFoMo,"Alittle late, but I was thinking of requesting either Laura reanamated and dressed as Calib from Blood, or Maddie and Nibbly infect (or try to infect) Karen with Were-Squrral-ness."
11-10-2018T22:40:35,SageSaga,playing a super hero game- got to remind everyone why im awesome at super heroing
11-10-2018T22:40:41,BadFoMo,*A little
11-10-2018T22:42:47,Ordithus,What did you do...
11-10-2018T22:43:08,Mihari,Here we go XD
11-10-2018T22:43:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Mihari o/
11-10-2018T22:43:29,SageSaga,where we go?
11-10-2018T22:43:54,Mihari,"Just noting if you weren't a super hero, you'd be a good bard cause you love to recant your epic tales XD"
11-10-2018T22:44:01,Dadrobit,"FoMo, I considered piggybacking off of your suggestion last time and having Nibbly suffer from a Maddie bite and become a were-basitin squirell. Wasn't sure how to word it though lol."
11-10-2018T22:44:24,SageSaga,Ive rarely played bards
11-10-2018T22:44:30,SageSaga,:D
11-10-2018T22:44:50,SageSaga,I tried to tell you about this part but it was late-
11-10-2018T22:45:31,SageSaga,We were fighting a super tough opponent and a sound using opponent - and the team just was not listening to me -
11-10-2018T22:46:19,SageSaga,"they were getting blasted back, getting lined up for his sonic blasts and not using their defensive abilities! Like a Lann!"
11-10-2018T22:47:11,SageSaga,"So i ran over to the stage, grabbed an amp and a mic- and used my broadcast power to negate the enemies sound barrier"
11-10-2018T22:47:34,SageSaga,90% of his stuff became totally useless
11-10-2018T22:47:43,SageSaga,and the group stomped him into the ground
11-10-2018T22:48:53,SageSaga,"and one of the Heroes said- ""How were you able to do that?"" and i said ""A high school education?"""
11-10-2018T22:49:33,Ordithus,:speaker: <-- to defeat evil
11-10-2018T22:49:48,Ordithus,:loud_sound:
11-10-2018T22:51:40,SageSaga,actually- do they still teach about wave cancellation in high school?
11-10-2018T22:52:17,ZRO4825,I don't think they taught that in high school back when I was there...
11-10-2018T22:52:18,Mihari,I would say it would depend on the school on whether anything is taught.
11-10-2018T22:52:37,Dadrobit,"Yes, phase cancelation is taught."
11-10-2018T22:53:09,ZRO4825,"Must've been taught in a branch of science I never took a class in then, lol"

11-10-2018T22:53:48,Dadrobit,"Also, audio engieering, but that was in college. So probably not what you're thinkin of."

11-10-2018T22:54:10,Mihari,watches hope for humanity fail all three of it's death saves.
11-10-2018T22:54:55,SageSaga,i took Physics and Principles of Technology and another Electronics class
11-10-2018T22:55:00,SageSaga,they all talked about it
11-10-2018T22:56:22,Ordithus,I don't remember when I first learned it
11-10-2018T22:56:29,ZRO4825,":thinking: I never took a Physics class that I can recall. So yeah. Probably was supposed to come after Chemistry, and I dropped from Chemistry due to a shitty teacher."
11-10-2018T22:56:54,ZRO4825,"Already had enough Science credits at that point to graduate so I said to hell with Science for the rest of high school, lol"
11-10-2018T22:56:57,SageSaga,I always regret not taking Chemistry
11-10-2018T22:57:19,Bgrmystr2,There was no physics class in my high school lol
11-10-2018T22:57:28,Bgrmystr2,"in fact, I don't think we had chemistry either"
11-10-2018T22:57:34,Ordithus,Dang
11-10-2018T22:57:48,SageSaga,thats sad
11-10-2018T22:57:59,Bgrmystr2,yeah actually
11-10-2018T22:58:40,SageSaga,"almost as sad as ""We were taught creationism"""
11-10-2018T22:59:21,SageSaga,"or ""mom didnt know about that one so we just focused on more calculator practice"""
11-10-2018T23:00:21,SageSaga,(its a joke about homeschooling)
11-10-2018T23:01:39,Dadrobit,Both parents and several grandparents are teachers. I probably would have turned out well enough homeshcooled. Not that I'd want to have been.
11-10-2018T23:01:44,SageSaga,that said- i still really wish we had someone else to DM on Saturdays so I could play with Mihari and Tom instead of running the game
