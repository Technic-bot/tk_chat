16-11-2018T00:00:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Regular fingers only plz
16-11-2018T00:00:22,Vatruvius,"Break your fingers, show'em whose boss!"
16-11-2018T00:00:26,SpazztasticKiwi,:ptv-snicker:
16-11-2018T00:00:26,Bgrmystr2,give me normal fingers please
16-11-2018T00:00:32,Bgrmystr2,You think I'm not close to it!
16-11-2018T00:00:41,Bgrmystr2,I've come close to doing that.
16-11-2018T00:00:48,Vatruvius,. . .
16-11-2018T00:01:04,Bgrmystr2,"I brain one thing, fingers do something completely different. At this point, I might just replace them with robotics. It seriously cannot be worse."
16-11-2018T00:01:25,Vatruvius,Except slower.
16-11-2018T00:01:31,Vatruvius,And expensive.
16-11-2018T00:01:54,Bgrmystr2,"Oh trust me, they won't be slower lol"
16-11-2018T00:02:12,Bgrmystr2,with the amount of time I gotta waste fixing stuff
16-11-2018T00:02:20,ZRO4825,lol
16-11-2018T00:03:52,Vatruvius,"Here is a curious question, would any of you like to see magnetic, flying cars in my webcomic?"
16-11-2018T00:03:54,SageSaga,one week and still no one has joined my patreon as a birthday gift
16-11-2018T00:04:10,ZRO4825,I could stop being on it and rejoin? :v
16-11-2018T00:04:12,Vatruvius,"Well, I am a patron, does that count?"
16-11-2018T00:04:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m there in spirit
16-11-2018T00:04:27,Ordithus,"I gave you an early birthday present, a while back"
16-11-2018T00:04:28,Bgrmystr2,I'm not sure why you'd be expecting that sage lol
16-11-2018T00:04:43,Bgrmystr2,rather unorthadox gift imo
16-11-2018T00:04:55,Vatruvius,Maybe a one time upgrade?
16-11-2018T00:05:03,Vatruvius,I will have to check my bank account...
16-11-2018T00:05:05,SageSaga,oh i dont know- maybe because i told people that joining my Patreon would be a great birthday gift and my birthday is in a few weeks? XD
16-11-2018T00:05:15,ShadowSoap,"Good evening, everyone!"
16-11-2018T00:05:16,Bgrmystr2,I'd just send money :U
16-11-2018T00:05:25,SageSaga,that works too
16-11-2018T00:05:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I thought you said it was in 8 days
16-11-2018T00:05:29,Combak,Hi Soap!
16-11-2018T00:05:36,Bgrmystr2,patreon doesn't really feel like a gift
16-11-2018T00:05:42,Combak,He did Kiwi
16-11-2018T00:05:46,TheRagingRedfox,"Good morning... yes, morning. It’s 6:05AM here :)"
16-11-2018T00:05:48,SageSaga,its 7 days now seeing as it is 12:05am Saturday
16-11-2018T00:05:51,Vatruvius,"...and my bank account says no. Sorry Sage, you are stuck with what I am already giving."
16-11-2018T00:05:56,Combak,Hi Redfox.
16-11-2018T00:06:02,SageSaga,np thanks for being a patron :D
16-11-2018T00:06:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Still 11:05 here
16-11-2018T00:06:07,Bgrmystr2,lol Redfox
16-11-2018T00:06:12,Bgrmystr2,morning is when you make it
16-11-2018T00:06:16,SageSaga,well my birthday doesnt go by your time does it?!
16-11-2018T00:06:17,Bgrmystr2,so make it a good one :P
16-11-2018T00:06:21,SageSaga,XD
16-11-2018T00:06:23,TheRagingRedfox,Just did an all nighter with Fortnite
16-11-2018T00:06:27,Combak,And mourning is when something dies
16-11-2018T00:06:35,Bgrmystr2,combak pls
16-11-2018T00:06:48,Vatruvius,Why bring that up?
16-11-2018T00:06:53,Bgrmystr2,because rhymes.
16-11-2018T00:07:01,Combak,"Actually, homophones."
16-11-2018T00:07:09,Vatruvius,?
16-11-2018T00:07:09,ShadowSoap,Because we’re all dead on the inside...
16-11-2018T00:07:13,SpazztasticKiwi,..how about a birthday hug
16-11-2018T00:07:15,Bgrmystr2,close enough
16-11-2018T00:07:24,Vatruvius,I am not sure about you but I am certainly not dead inside.
16-11-2018T00:07:47,Bgrmystr2,oh I die a little inside sometimes.
16-11-2018T00:07:52,ShadowSoap,I’m just dead tired
16-11-2018T00:07:53,Bgrmystr2,so I've just rolled over.
16-11-2018T00:08:00,Bgrmystr2,I'm like -27 lives right now.
16-11-2018T00:08:05,Bgrmystr2,"still goin,."
16-11-2018T00:08:08,Vatruvius,"Judging by the lack of responses, I suppose no magnetic, flying cars in my webcomic based upon unpopular demand...?"
16-11-2018T00:08:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though on second thought, I have a thing about touching people....."
16-11-2018T00:08:12,Bgrmystr2,"might be 30, who knows"
16-11-2018T00:08:12,Ordithus,"You should get that checked out, bgr"
16-11-2018T00:08:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Virtual happy birthday cake it is! 🎂
16-11-2018T00:08:34,Bgrmystr2,"I wish I could check out the things that cause me to die on the inside, but I can't change other people, ord. :ptv-SteelwormHades:"
16-11-2018T00:08:34,ShadowSoap,"Flying cars sounds cool, if it makes sense in universe"
16-11-2018T00:08:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"Go for it, Vat"
16-11-2018T00:09:05,Vatruvius,"It would, but I am wondering if it is like...for the wealthy or somesuch."
16-11-2018T00:09:09,Ordithus,"Be the change, bgr"
16-11-2018T00:09:13,SpazztasticKiwi,But make sure you’re ok incorporating it with everything else you have
16-11-2018T00:09:16,Bgrmystr2,I am.
16-11-2018T00:09:20,SpazztasticKiwi,so it makes sense
16-11-2018T00:09:21,Bgrmystr2,Noone listens.
16-11-2018T00:09:29,Ordithus,"Well, then all hope is lost"
16-11-2018T00:09:40,Bgrmystr2,Why do you think I end up so dead Dx :urn:
16-11-2018T00:09:48,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-LauraCry:
16-11-2018T00:09:52,Vatruvius,The reason why I ask is because I have this great visual in my head of a magnetic highway of sorts heading into the city.
16-11-2018T00:10:06,ShadowSoap,"That sounds cool, Vat."
16-11-2018T00:10:21,Bgrmystr2,"Lol, then do it"
16-11-2018T00:10:25,Vatruvius,The visual certainly looks cool.
16-11-2018T00:10:35,Bgrmystr2,"Don't let your memes be dreams, vatru :P"
16-11-2018T00:10:45,Vatruvius,lol
16-11-2018T00:10:47,ShadowSoap,Just DO IT
16-11-2018T00:10:51,Bgrmystr2,draw your magnetic highway
16-11-2018T00:10:53,Vatruvius,NO!
16-11-2018T00:10:55,Bgrmystr2,make it amazeballs
16-11-2018T00:11:22,Bgrmystr2,"well, if you don't do it, then you'll always sit there and think ""Man, I really should have taken that chance"""
16-11-2018T00:11:24,Vatruvius,I will have to do some research into how a magnetic highway would work...
16-11-2018T00:11:26,Bgrmystr2,regret forever.
16-11-2018T00:11:36,Ordithus,look up MAGLEV
16-11-2018T00:11:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Spoiler: magnets
16-11-2018T00:11:42,Vatruvius,"...rather, how magnets work in a very large scale."
16-11-2018T00:11:45,Bgrmystr2,"maglev, prettymuch"
16-11-2018T00:11:48,ShadowSoap,Do we truly understand how magnets work now?
16-11-2018T00:11:52,Ordithus,Magic
16-11-2018T00:11:58,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, did we ever, shadow?"
16-11-2018T00:12:06,Bgrmystr2,do we truly understand anything>?
16-11-2018T00:12:13,Vatruvius,A maglev is not even close to what I have in mind.
16-11-2018T00:12:21,ShadowSoap,"Nope, BGE"
16-11-2018T00:12:30,ShadowSoap,*BGR
16-11-2018T00:12:34,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, but it's fundamentally how things would move quickly, Vatru"
16-11-2018T00:12:34,Vatruvius,My webcomic is very much far into the future so this is some next level type s***.
16-11-2018T00:12:36,SageSaga,any cars parked on the side of said road would be screwed
16-11-2018T00:13:01,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
16-11-2018T00:13:05,Combak,Sounds like a less realistic version of the hyperloop.
16-11-2018T00:13:07,Vatruvius,"Hence a magnetic highway, not standard transportation."
16-11-2018T00:13:07,InTheLionsDen,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
16-11-2018T00:13:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
16-11-2018T00:13:17,Bgrmystr2,"it's not just about magnetizing the whole road, just the specific part that the vehicle is above."

16-11-2018T00:13:37,Vatruvius,"It is not above or below Bgr, the cars are on the side."
16-11-2018T00:13:52,ShadowSoap,Bruh
16-11-2018T00:13:55,Bgrmystr2,wat
16-11-2018T00:14:02,ShadowSoap,That sounds sick af
16-11-2018T00:14:16,Ordithus,Minority Report style?  Or something else still?
16-11-2018T00:14:16,Combak,"... Wait, where did that butterfly even come from?"
16-11-2018T00:14:21,Bgrmystr2,it also sounds like magnets is not how that would work
16-11-2018T00:14:30,ShadowSoap,Shhhhhh
16-11-2018T00:14:42,Bgrmystr2,"no, cuz someone's gonna look at it and say wtf"
16-11-2018T00:14:46,Vatruvius,"My thinking is, with the right shape and power, an electric magnet could trap a car to the side of the highway allowing it to ""fly""."
16-11-2018T00:14:47,Bgrmystr2,it's gonna happen xD
16-11-2018T00:15:14,Combak,Or get stuck to the side of the highway?
16-11-2018T00:15:30,Bgrmystr2,"you'd need something pulling on both sides of the vehicle, vatru"
16-11-2018T00:15:34,Bgrmystr2,with equal force
16-11-2018T00:15:35,Vatruvius,"I am all for sci-fi Bgr, I will do my research to make sure that it is ""possible"" not impossible."
16-11-2018T00:15:36,Bgrmystr2,to suspend it
16-11-2018T00:16:03,Vatruvius,"I just need a potential possibility to put it in. If not, then no magnetic highway or a redesign."
16-11-2018T00:16:24,Bgrmystr2,there's things you can find where it has the planet earth sphere in this C shape thing
16-11-2018T00:16:30,Bgrmystr2,and it's suspended mid-air by magnets
16-11-2018T00:16:43,Bgrmystr2,it's cool as shit
16-11-2018T00:16:45,Vatruvius,That is pretty cool.
16-11-2018T00:16:54,Vatruvius,Now I am going to have to have one.
16-11-2018T00:17:00,Bgrmystr2,haha
16-11-2018T00:17:09,Vatruvius,Adding to Amazon wish list...
16-11-2018T00:17:11,ShadowSoap,"I really need to get some sleep, so I’ll have to cut my time here short..."
16-11-2018T00:17:20,ShadowSoap,GN Everyone...
16-11-2018T00:17:22,Vatruvius,Goodnight Soap!
16-11-2018T00:17:24,Ordithus,Night Shadow
16-11-2018T00:17:37,SageSaga,you can also get levitating desktop decorations- but as always with magnets- its a delicate balance
16-11-2018T00:17:56,Bgrmystr2,I'm gonna see if I can find the one I remember for ya vatru
16-11-2018T00:18:03,Ordithus,Between levitation and wiping your harddrive?
16-11-2018T00:18:13,Vatruvius,Ohh yeah...maybe a levitating pen holder for my drawing monitor...
16-11-2018T00:18:18,ZRO4825,"It takes a pretty hefty magnet to wipe hard drives, lol"
16-11-2018T00:18:40,SageSaga,it also would have to be in your computer or on your computer at the least
16-11-2018T00:19:23,Ordithus,Levitating computers? :thinking:
16-11-2018T00:19:48,Bgrmystr2,"not great for the hardware inside though, ord"

16-11-2018T00:22:11,SageSaga,its a waste of money
16-11-2018T00:22:36,ZRO4825,Oh I'm aware.

16-11-2018T00:23:44,Vatruvius,You mean Mike?
16-11-2018T00:24:43,Vatruvius,What would be even cooler is if it could accurately show the current phase of the moon...

16-11-2018T00:28:57,Vatruvius,"Yeah, my idea is to have the cars on the side of the highway and shifting lanes is going up or down and not left or right."

16-11-2018T00:31:11,Bgrmystr2,at this point
16-11-2018T00:31:21,Vatruvius,I am not replacing all transportation with this. This is considered high end transportation and it in certain areas of the city. There are still normal roads and what have you.
16-11-2018T00:31:23,Twokinds,Done

16-11-2018T00:34:36,w0lfmare,"No text, just tears"
16-11-2018T00:34:36,Zakuru,getting that kathrin treatment
16-11-2018T00:34:44,Combak,Rule of Cool?
16-11-2018T00:34:47,Vatruvius,For Harry Potter nerds to feel like they belong somewhere?
16-11-2018T00:34:48,Vatruvius,XD
16-11-2018T00:34:53,Zakuru,"oh sage, question"
16-11-2018T00:34:55,SageSaga,uhg
16-11-2018T00:34:58,Combak,Sporting in the Wizarding World?
16-11-2018T00:35:00,Bgrmystr2,lool
16-11-2018T00:35:03,Zakuru,Does the rule of thirds apply to comic panels? :thinking:
16-11-2018T00:35:08,SageSaga,im trying to help people be better writers
16-11-2018T00:35:08,Corinthian,Well I'm heading off. Good night everyone!
16-11-2018T00:35:19,Ordithus,Night Corin
16-11-2018T00:35:22,Bgrmystr2,gnight corin
16-11-2018T00:35:27,FoxxTrotter,"I'ma heading off as well. G'night, everyone. :0)"
16-11-2018T00:35:28,Combak,"Well then, tell us, because we clearly are forgetting something."
16-11-2018T00:35:32,SageSaga,it can
16-11-2018T00:35:34,Bgrmystr2,gnight foxx as well
16-11-2018T00:35:35,Vatruvius,I get what you mean though Sage and there will be a very good reason for something like this.
16-11-2018T00:35:37,Zakuru,oh sage you give writing advice? i need some since i just rage quited my novel for tonight
16-11-2018T00:35:38,Combak,Night Corin and Foxx.
16-11-2018T00:35:46,Ordithus,Night Foxx
16-11-2018T00:36:10,unsteddyphoenix,"Late but, nice work Tom"
16-11-2018T00:36:24,unsteddyphoenix,Last panel is mystery dialogue?
16-11-2018T00:36:25,Twokinds,Thanks!
16-11-2018T00:36:31,Twokinds,Ye
16-11-2018T00:36:34,Bgrmystr2,"that was my thoughts, phoenix"
16-11-2018T00:36:35,Bgrmystr2,I KNEW IT
16-11-2018T00:36:37,unsteddyphoenix,Ooo~
16-11-2018T00:36:37,Twokinds,I'm done for tonight
16-11-2018T00:36:38,Combak,*Yeet
16-11-2018T00:36:43,SageSaga,imagine this- JK Rowling spends 3 pages explaining all the rules and positions and goals for Quidditch
16-11-2018T00:36:46,Zakuru,great job tom!
16-11-2018T00:36:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Thanks for the stream Tom, and the gun shoots"
16-11-2018T00:36:56,Sammit,Thanks for the stream Tom
16-11-2018T00:36:58,Combak,"Well then, thanks for streaming Tom?"
16-11-2018T00:36:58,SageSaga,and then- they never talk about Quidditch again
16-11-2018T00:37:00,Ordithus,"Great work, Tom"
16-11-2018T00:37:03,unsteddyphoenix,"Great work Tom, thanks for streamin'~"
16-11-2018T00:37:05,Zakuru,"wow sage, did she really???"
16-11-2018T00:37:05,DeanFox,thanks for streaming Tom
16-11-2018T00:37:14,SageSaga,i said imagine
16-11-2018T00:37:21,Bgrmystr2,thanks for streaming tom :D
16-11-2018T00:37:21,Zakuru,oh phew
16-11-2018T00:37:43,SageSaga,thanks for joining me Tom- i'll be done soon XD
16-11-2018T00:37:50,Twokinds,^^
16-11-2018T00:37:52,Combak,"Okay, I get that point Sage... But what if she just never mentioned it at all?"
16-11-2018T00:37:57,Zakuru,"nighty tom! thanks for the stream, good night everyone xoxo"
16-11-2018T00:38:02,Vatruvius,So basically why bother adding something if it is only appears once...
16-11-2018T00:38:03,Ordithus,"Early night for you, Sage"
16-11-2018T00:38:06,HeresyArtStream,night Tom
16-11-2018T00:38:11,SageSaga,that would be what you should do Combak
16-11-2018T00:38:11,Combak,"Oh, and night Tom!"
16-11-2018T00:38:22,Ordithus,Night night Tom
16-11-2018T00:38:31,SageSaga,if the thing has nothing to do with the story- you dont need to mention it or explain it OR SHOW IT
16-11-2018T00:39:06,w0lfmare,Night Tom even though I know you're not going anywhere until an unfixed amount of time after Sage's stream ends o/
16-11-2018T00:39:18,SageSaga,for example- if in Yosh! i showed them traveling place to place in a rocket ship- never explained it- never talked about it at all- would people be totally fine with it?
16-11-2018T00:39:31,SageSaga,maybe- but those people are nuts
16-11-2018T00:39:49,Vatruvius,"Hm...that is an interesting point. As far as my thought process goes, this magnetic highway was just a cool visual with the panorama of the city. But I could also add it as part of the transportation my characters use. At no point would I explain how it"
16-11-2018T00:39:50,Vatruvius,works.
16-11-2018T00:40:12,Vatruvius,I would just like to know if it is possible because my webcomic has a scientific footing.
16-11-2018T00:40:25,SageSaga,how do you sit in a vehicle that drives on its side?
16-11-2018T00:40:37,SageSaga,what's the point though?
16-11-2018T00:40:41,Combak,Uncomfortably.
16-11-2018T00:40:42,ZRO4825,"If you're doing a webcomic, pretty much gotta consider that at some point, someone WILL ask questions about stuff that you thought no one would care about. :P"
16-11-2018T00:40:45,Ordithus,Possible?  Maybe.  Practical?  Dunno
16-11-2018T00:40:58,Vatruvius,"Drives on the side of the highway, still upright for the passengers."
16-11-2018T00:41:01,SageSaga,if your only point is it looks cool- then its not a good reason to include it
16-11-2018T00:41:02,Twokinds,That's never happened to me!
16-11-2018T00:41:24,Combak,"Tom, you know you're just asking for it now, right?"
16-11-2018T00:41:25,Ordithus,"Tom, what is King Adelaide's first name?"
16-11-2018T00:41:30,Twokinds,King
16-11-2018T00:41:34,Vatruvius,lol
16-11-2018T00:41:35,ZRO4825,XD
16-11-2018T00:41:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lo;
16-11-2018T00:41:44,Ordithus,":ctwokinds-kingtea: *[Born for it, baby]"
16-11-2018T00:41:46,Combak,"Tom, why do some characters mention ""Fates""?"
16-11-2018T00:42:06,Vatruvius,"I will have to consider this Sage, thanks. To think this all started with a simple question if people would like to see something like this."
16-11-2018T00:42:08,Twokinds,Another word for the masks
16-11-2018T00:42:10,Twokinds,collectively
16-11-2018T00:42:12,Ordithus,Does Maren know her hair is purple?
16-11-2018T00:42:14,MrEase,King King Adelaide
16-11-2018T00:42:17,Combak,"Oh, I see..."
16-11-2018T00:42:23,Twokinds,Purple is a very common hair color
16-11-2018T00:42:32,Vatruvius,Hmm...
16-11-2018T00:42:34,ZRO4825,Purple is one of the best hair colors. <3
16-11-2018T00:42:38,Combak,You should use it more often. :p
16-11-2018T00:42:45,unsteddyphoenix,It
16-11-2018T00:42:50,unsteddyphoenix,Is not
16-11-2018T00:43:08,ZRO4825,Yuh huh.
16-11-2018T00:43:45,Ordithus,How much potential magic energy does a 1 kilogram mana stone store?
16-11-2018T00:43:48,Combak,"Seriously though; introduce the Edinmire guards, everyone has normal hair colors."
16-11-2018T00:44:10,Vatruvius,Or do they Combak!?
16-11-2018T00:44:15,Combak,"""Purple is a very common hair color."""
16-11-2018T00:44:15,Vatruvius,That is the real question!
16-11-2018T00:44:16,Twokinds,Enough to microwave a burrito
16-11-2018T00:44:20,Combak,lol
16-11-2018T00:44:23,Ordithus,Nice
16-11-2018T00:44:36,w0lfmare,Trace's town is next to a magical waste dumping site
16-11-2018T00:44:37,Vatruvius,That is not a lot of potential magic Tom.
16-11-2018T00:44:47,Combak,"Tom, you know that gives us number, right?"
16-11-2018T00:44:56,Twokinds,Oh I thought you said gram
16-11-2018T00:45:03,Ordithus,1000 burritos!
16-11-2018T00:45:06,unsteddyphoenix,Enough to NUKE a burrito
16-11-2018T00:45:07,Twokinds,Enough to blow up a burrito factory
16-11-2018T00:45:10,Combak,"Also, the map of Mekkan... Is that to scale?"
16-11-2018T00:45:12,Combak,lol
16-11-2018T00:45:15,Vatruvius,Wow...that is a lot of magic. Okay!
16-11-2018T00:45:18,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:
16-11-2018T00:45:24,Combak,Sounds like exponential growth then.
16-11-2018T00:45:53,w0lfmare,"If a dragon lays still long enough, will they be encased in mana crystals?"
16-11-2018T00:45:58,Twokinds,I actually have a hard time conseptualizing what a kilogram is in my head
16-11-2018T00:46:12,Backonninja,what's the explosive being compared to?
16-11-2018T00:46:12,unsteddyphoenix,It's like 1000 grams
16-11-2018T00:46:17,Twokinds,"I am an American. I do try, but it doesn't come naturally."
16-11-2018T00:46:35,Ordithus,Map!
16-11-2018T00:46:39,Combak,1 lb is about half a kilogram
16-11-2018T00:47:03,Combak,2.205 lb is 1 kilo.
16-11-2018T00:47:08,Vatruvius,"Round about, yeah."
16-11-2018T00:47:11,Vatruvius,There you go.
16-11-2018T00:48:20,Ordithus,What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen dragon?
16-11-2018T00:48:27,Vatruvius,lol
16-11-2018T00:48:49,Backonninja,1 pound is about 100/2205 kilograms
16-11-2018T00:49:11,Vatruvius,Uhh...
16-11-2018T00:49:22,InTheLionsDen,"Sure, that helped."
16-11-2018T00:49:24,Ordithus,Missing a zero there
16-11-2018T00:49:32,Twokinds,black or white dragon?
16-11-2018T00:49:34,Vatruvius,"Yeah, was pretty sure that was off."
16-11-2018T00:49:38,Vatruvius,"Both, Tom."
16-11-2018T00:49:40,Ordithus,I... I don't know
16-11-2018T00:49:47,Twokinds,fwoosh!
16-11-2018T00:49:49,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-natanisleep: night!
16-11-2018T00:49:52,Backonninja,Grey
16-11-2018T00:49:55,Vatruvius,Goodnight Ord.
16-11-2018T00:50:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Ord
16-11-2018T00:50:06,Twokinds,G'night Vatruvius
16-11-2018T00:50:16,Vatruvius,I am not leaving...?
16-11-2018T00:50:19,Vatruvius,Am I?
16-11-2018T00:50:21,Twokinds,G'night Marv
16-11-2018T00:50:36,Vatruvius,Do you know something I do not Tom?
16-11-2018T00:50:41,Vatruvius,This has me alarmed.
16-11-2018T00:50:44,Combak,Night Ord!
16-11-2018T00:50:45,SageSaga,he's trolling
16-11-2018T00:50:48,Bgrmystr2,gnight Tom :V
16-11-2018T00:50:51,Bgrmystr2,and Sage
16-11-2018T00:51:04,Bgrmystr2,EVERYONE goes to sleep at the same time yep :ptv-sleepy:
16-11-2018T00:51:06,Combak,"Yeah, he's just covering for his first blunder by making a second."
16-11-2018T00:51:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,guess I'm going to bed?
16-11-2018T00:51:11,w0lfmare,"He's not trolling, it's just... Tomfoolery"
16-11-2018T00:51:14,Bgrmystr2,even people like me who never go to sleep
16-11-2018T00:51:23,Bgrmystr2,lol w0lf xD
16-11-2018T00:54:08,SageSaga,Done just before 1am
16-11-2018T00:54:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Very well done Sage
16-11-2018T00:54:21,Vatruvius,Nice Sage.
16-11-2018T00:54:26,Combak,Nice job Sage!
16-11-2018T00:55:01,Vatruvius,lol
16-11-2018T00:55:08,unsteddyphoenix,"Well done  sage, proud of you"
16-11-2018T00:55:28,Bgrmystr2,Nicely done sage
16-11-2018T00:55:37,w0lfmare,Nice
16-11-2018T00:55:47,Twokinds,Congratulations!
16-11-2018T00:56:20,SageSaga,printing these soon - only gonna print 9 of each- 10 actually but im keeping 2 XD
16-11-2018T00:57:01,Combak,Of course you are. XD
16-11-2018T00:57:27,Vatruvius,"Considering what you said Sage, my magnetic highway is not a part of my universe like Quidditch is in Harry Potter. Rather, they are a part of the world/environment. They could be used but I do not think described."
16-11-2018T00:57:41,Vatruvius,A good thing about it is it shows that webcomic takes place in the future.
16-11-2018T00:58:09,SageSaga,if it doesnt make sense IRL its probably a bad idea
16-11-2018T00:58:31,Bgrmystr2,"showing the environment is a good idea, just gotta make sense"
16-11-2018T00:58:34,Combak,"Like I said, it's basically the Hyperloop."
16-11-2018T00:58:40,Vatruvius,"Well, I do not think anthros would make sense in real life..."
16-11-2018T00:58:43,Combak,"Only, done badly. XD"
16-11-2018T00:58:45,SageSaga,people dont question why a kettle on the stove steams in a movie- but they will question random bull crap thrown in just because it looks cool
16-11-2018T00:58:51,Bgrmystr2,people are gonna ask *why*
16-11-2018T00:59:02,Combak,Anthros are just basically human pallet swpas normally.
16-11-2018T00:59:22,SageSaga,yeah non-human characters are pretty normal in fantasy
16-11-2018T00:59:28,Vatruvius,"The thought is cool, I am not just going to be drawing cool stuff for that reason alone. It will serve a purpose."
16-11-2018T00:59:49,Combak,Good. Then figure it out!
16-11-2018T01:00:07,Vatruvius,It really just serves as part of the world that the webcomic takes place in.
16-11-2018T01:00:23,SageSaga,"im just saying- if you are going to do it- give it a purpose- if the purpose is just to ""look cool"" question that reason otherwise its a waste of the readers time"
16-11-2018T01:00:36,Vatruvius,No one really questioned futuristic stuff in sci-fi movies and tv shows because they are accepted as sci-fi.
16-11-2018T01:00:47,SageSaga,yes they do- we do it all the time
16-11-2018T01:00:50,Bgrmystr2,actually a lot of people do it xD
16-11-2018T01:00:51,Combak,"Well, I'm going to head to bed."
16-11-2018T01:00:56,Vatruvius,"God no, never just cause it looks cool."
16-11-2018T01:00:56,Bgrmystr2,and are fairly critical of it
16-11-2018T01:01:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,nighty night combak
16-11-2018T01:01:04,Combak,Night all!
16-11-2018T01:01:12,Combak,"Sage, Tom, thanks for streaming!"
16-11-2018T01:01:13,Vatruvius,"Maybe as an idea starter, but not as a final decision."
16-11-2018T01:01:23,Combak,See you all next time!
16-11-2018T01:01:25,SageSaga,like the death star- that thing was pointless- we like the idea of a weapon capable of destroying planets- but they already could do that
16-11-2018T01:01:37,Bgrmystr2,"it's all about suspension of disbelief, Vatru. If it makes sense in your world."
16-11-2018T01:01:44,Combak,"Oh, and thanks Marv."
16-11-2018T01:01:51,SageSaga,its purpose though was to be a symbol of evil that the heroes defeat
16-11-2018T01:01:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,<3
16-11-2018T01:02:02,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, tom's comic has magic that can bend the fabric of space itself"
16-11-2018T01:02:07,Bgrmystr2,and they make boob wraps out of it
16-11-2018T01:02:10,Bgrmystr2,so I mean..
16-11-2018T01:02:32,Bgrmystr2,even if the purpose is silly
16-11-2018T01:02:35,Bgrmystr2,it became a plot point
16-11-2018T01:02:43,SageSaga,extradimensional space is another common trope- so Tom is just using a known Trope for comedy
16-11-2018T01:02:54,Vatruvius,I am critical of sci-fi things and want to make sure anything I use has some basis in real world science. I want it to be something that looks or sounds feasible before it ever makes an appearance.
16-11-2018T01:02:55,ZRO4825,Still need to have someone stick their head in that cloth. :P
16-11-2018T01:02:57,w0lfmare,"Helping convey that it's a futuristic world is a good enough reason to add it, is it not?"
16-11-2018T01:03:04,Bgrmystr2,friendly reminder that rule of cool is also a trope
16-11-2018T01:03:19,SageSaga,w0lf no
16-11-2018T01:03:25,ZRO4825,"""What's in here?"" *Bwom*"
16-11-2018T01:03:33,Bgrmystr2,lool zro
16-11-2018T01:03:46,Bgrmystr2,"well, we had keith's hand at least"
16-11-2018T01:03:48,Bgrmystr2,for that.
16-11-2018T01:04:09,Bgrmystr2,we don't know if there's anything to breathe if you stick your head in there
16-11-2018T01:04:21,SageSaga,"you just need futuristic versions of things that already exist- you dont need to do a whole ""Here's how cars work now"" thing- you just draw cars without wheels and leave it at that"
16-11-2018T01:04:23,Vatruvius,So what would be a good reason in your eyes Sage?
16-11-2018T01:04:36,Vatruvius,I was never going to explain it...
16-11-2018T01:04:44,Vatruvius,Not planning on it anyway.
16-11-2018T01:04:52,Vatruvius,It is just the way of life for my characters.
16-11-2018T01:04:57,SageSaga,just showing it and how weird it is is enough
16-11-2018T01:05:15,Bgrmystr2,many sci-fi settings have futuristic transportation that's never explained
16-11-2018T01:05:17,Vatruvius,"Yeah, I was not going to give n exposition on it."
16-11-2018T01:05:24,Vatruvius,an*
16-11-2018T01:05:41,SageSaga,but its usually just roads or going from roads to flying
16-11-2018T01:05:53,w0lfmare,Making things up ain't a bad thing in writing
16-11-2018T01:05:56,SageSaga,its not about exposition
16-11-2018T01:05:58,Vatruvius,"I guess it is both, a flying road?"
16-11-2018T01:06:13,w0lfmare,As long as you make it work
16-11-2018T01:06:34,SageSaga,yes- you have to make it work- it needs a PURPOSE
16-11-2018T01:06:50,SageSaga,"im trying to say- if the purpose is just ""It looks cool"" its a bad purpose"
16-11-2018T01:07:15,SageSaga,"if it's ""A legit way to reduce traffic"" that's a purpose"
16-11-2018T01:07:19,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, vatru, I think sage is right in that I think there's a lack of purpose of cars being, yknow, on the side of a highway when we already see em on top."
16-11-2018T01:07:24,w0lfmare,miyazaki Stuff is full of things just there to look cool
16-11-2018T01:07:49,SageSaga,like?
16-11-2018T01:08:19,Vatruvius,"Yeah, no. It started out as a cool idea in my head which I am now looking for feedback and doing research to find a purpose, or rather a basis in science for its functionality. I would not want to just say, we have weird teleport devices that are used"
16-11-2018T01:08:23,Vatruvius,and not used.
16-11-2018T01:08:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"hidetaka miyazaki, or Hayao Miyazaki?"
16-11-2018T01:08:26,w0lfmare,"Howl's moving castle, and basically everything in it"
16-11-2018T01:08:28,Vatruvius,That would make no sense.
16-11-2018T01:08:30,Bgrmystr2,there's bridges that cars drive over but also have train tracks on the bridge too like on the side or below
16-11-2018T01:08:49,Bgrmystr2,and that's just for efficiency of space
16-11-2018T01:08:54,SageSaga,Wow you think all that was meaningless?
16-11-2018T01:09:03,Vatruvius,"They reason for being on the side of the road is versatility, this is a city and space is precious."
16-11-2018T01:09:07,w0lfmare,I didn't say it was meaningless
16-11-2018T01:09:22,SageSaga,ok then what do you think without a purpose is?
16-11-2018T01:10:03,w0lfmare,"It created a mysterious, magical environment. Also it was messy"
16-11-2018T01:10:23,SageSaga,Im trying to help people think more about their writing and realize that just because something sounds or looks cool is not a good reason to do it. That there should be as much meaning placed into everything
16-11-2018T01:10:56,Vatruvius,"I have gotten that much for sure, and agree with you."
16-11-2018T01:11:24,SageSaga,"saying ""Hey this famous animator made cool stuff that I dont think had any meaning other than looking cool"" is not helping anything other than making me think you misunderstand so much more"
16-11-2018T01:11:46,Vatruvius,"An animator, what animator?"
16-11-2018T01:11:52,SageSaga,Miyazaki
16-11-2018T01:12:00,Vatruvius,Not familiar...
16-11-2018T01:12:03,SageSaga,wow
16-11-2018T01:12:14,w0lfmare,I just worry about keeping open minds and open creativity
16-11-2018T01:12:20,SageSaga,Vat- you have a lot to watch XD
16-11-2018T01:12:24,w0lfmare,^
16-11-2018T01:12:28,Vatruvius,I do...I know this.
16-11-2018T01:12:30,w0lfmare,It's good stuff
16-11-2018T01:12:43,Vatruvius,"Question is time, I'll add it to the list."
16-11-2018T01:12:47,SageSaga,W0lf- it's not about not keeping an open mind- its about expanding on it
16-11-2018T01:13:23,SageSaga,"If you just wanna draw cool things that's fine, but if those things have a reason or a purpose it's so much more meaningful"
16-11-2018T01:13:46,SageSaga,in a comic if you do this you are able to tell more of a story with less words
16-11-2018T01:14:29,w0lfmare,Yeah it's great for world building
16-11-2018T01:14:46,Vatruvius,"That is my hope, and the magic of webcomics. You can take out all the details and scene setting from a book and draw it, leaving the story in the dialogue and characters."
16-11-2018T01:14:47,SageSaga,it's part of story telling 101 to not include something that isnt vital to the story
16-11-2018T01:15:09,Bgrmystr2,yet looking at the rule of cool page on TV tropes.. it happens so often.. everywhere
16-11-2018T01:15:11,Bgrmystr2,even in real life
16-11-2018T01:15:57,SageSaga,we give those things a purpose to make them fit more
16-11-2018T01:16:29,SageSaga,if an artist loves drawing lightning storms because they are cool going to just draw them in every scene?
16-11-2018T01:16:56,Bgrmystr2,nice... wording you've got there lol
16-11-2018T01:16:58,w0lfmare,Haha only if that's what the comic is about
16-11-2018T01:17:05,SageSaga,Or would it just be better to say the world they are in is perpetually covered in storms due to a plot reason or make the main character control storms?
16-11-2018T01:17:13,Bgrmystr2,and maybe if there's a lightning storm :V
16-11-2018T01:17:31,Bgrmystr2,and yeah that
16-11-2018T01:17:44,SageSaga,you make the rule of cool WORK for your story
16-11-2018T01:17:56,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, he's still drawing the storms cuz they're cool, they just happen to work for the story too xD"
16-11-2018T01:18:25,Vatruvius,This goes way beyond what my highway is for...
16-11-2018T01:18:27,SageSaga,"it doesnt JUST SO HAPPEN man- you make a reason for it- then it happens for a reason even if you started with ""because its cool"""
16-11-2018T01:18:37,Vatruvius,We have entered something completely differently...
16-11-2018T01:19:01,SageSaga,Vat- think of it this way- your highway- is there something cool you can do with it that a normal highway couldnt do?
16-11-2018T01:19:14,SageSaga,Could a car go flying off the road and through a building?
16-11-2018T01:19:34,w0lfmare,Yeah my fault. Writing talk sucks me in XD
16-11-2018T01:19:46,SageSaga,because lets say- someone overloaded the highway electric system?
16-11-2018T01:20:07,Vatruvius,"Interesting ideas, but as I mentioned earlier it purpose is faster travel while at the same time taking up less space on the ground, this being a city and all."
16-11-2018T01:20:21,Vatruvius,I suppose that could happen Sag.e
16-11-2018T01:20:21,SageSaga,ok so lets go small-
16-11-2018T01:20:42,SageSaga,its a city with not enough space- so they made these special roads
16-11-2018T01:21:03,SageSaga,did the city grow super fast that they didnt have time to just- make bigger roads?
16-11-2018T01:21:21,Vatruvius,Now we are getting in world lore here...
16-11-2018T01:21:39,Bgrmystr2,maybe the highway is instead of being on the ground.. but runs across the sides of buldings.. removing the need to have roads in general cuz they can just go up and down to whatever floor
16-11-2018T01:21:44,SageSaga,who in their right mind makes crazy magno roads when you can just make bigger roads? So you give a reason for it!
16-11-2018T01:22:22,Vatruvius,"The city itself, which essential is the entire population of the planet, was designed by the villain in the story or constructed under his orders. The world at this point had a huge war that demolished everything, so there is a very good reason for this"
16-11-2018T01:22:36,Vatruvius,transportation in the city and in my universe.
16-11-2018T01:22:38,Bgrmystr2,"well, find that reason"
16-11-2018T01:22:53,SageSaga,"Thats all im saying- give em a purpose- you dont NEED to explain it- but YOU should know it - so you can show it and people can be like ""Oh- i get why they have these crazy roads! Overpopulation! Buildings attached to landscapes that couldnt be modified!"
16-11-2018T01:23:25,SageSaga,etc etc
16-11-2018T01:24:07,SageSaga,if you show huge fields next to a bunch of vertical roads im gonna call bull crap XD
16-11-2018T01:24:16,Bgrmystr2,haha
16-11-2018T01:24:19,Vatruvius,"I was never going to explain it, this was my view from the beginning. But because of the sci-fi critic in me I have to make sure it has some basis in science. That it is not downright impossible. That is just me trying to make my world more believable."
16-11-2018T01:24:22,DeanFox,always nice ot have a reason for stings even if it doesnt come up
16-11-2018T01:24:46,Vatruvius,"Nothing the reader would have to read, they would just see it and those that are critics could not find fault in it..."
16-11-2018T01:25:06,SageSaga,thats good- find a purpose for something to look cool and you're golden
16-11-2018T01:25:13,SageSaga,make your Quidditch roads
16-11-2018T01:25:15,SageSaga,:P
16-11-2018T01:25:20,Vatruvius,lol
16-11-2018T01:25:22,Vatruvius,XD
16-11-2018T01:25:22,SageSaga,peace folks!

16-11-2018T01:46:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"Again, no real clue"
16-11-2018T01:46:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"But hey, thanksgiving approacheth"

16-11-2018T01:47:01,SpazztasticKiwi,He should really consider retiring then
16-11-2018T01:47:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Ello again Tom
16-11-2018T01:47:23,RimaDraws,everyone doesnt see how im 31

16-11-2018T01:48:05,Twokinds,I plan to retire when I hit 100
16-11-2018T01:48:13,RimaDraws,i dont plan to retire at all
16-11-2018T01:48:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Why not? But if he wants to keep going...
16-11-2018T01:48:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,why at such a young aage?
16-11-2018T01:48:32,Bgrmystr2,lol sage is older than tom isn't he?
16-11-2018T01:48:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Retired at 100. What’ll ya do if arthritis gets you first?

16-11-2018T01:51:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"As an artist, that logic makes sense Tom"

16-11-2018T15:12:16,Tharkis,"i went to bed wicked early last night, and still barely woke up in time to have lunch with a friend"
16-11-2018T15:12:20,Tharkis,i might take a nap later lol
16-11-2018T15:12:58,Mippy,:tired_face: Gonna nap at some point...once the pain stops
16-11-2018T15:13:28,BadFoMo,Pain?
16-11-2018T15:13:55,Mippy,Lower back...had to leave work today because of it
16-11-2018T15:14:08,BadFoMo,Dang.
16-11-2018T15:15:42,SageSaga,that sucks
16-11-2018T15:16:23,Tharkis,back pain sucks =(
16-11-2018T15:16:40,BadFoMo,Yep.
16-11-2018T15:17:01,SageSaga,especially when it turns out to not be your back - and the doctor says we need to get you to the ER because your kidneys are shutting down
16-11-2018T15:17:18,BadFoMo,!
16-11-2018T15:17:35,Mippy,:ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:
16-11-2018T15:17:56,SageSaga,sooo- did you wrench your back or something?
16-11-2018T15:21:28,Mippy,"No, I’ve had back pain for years."
16-11-2018T15:22:06,Mippy,Just doing a lot of stuff I shouldn’t put a lot of stress on it
16-11-2018T15:23:24,Mippy,Probably shouldn’t use the drawing donkeys anymore. No proper back support
16-11-2018T15:23:51,BadFoMo,The whats?
16-11-2018T15:24:25,SageSaga,haha - Bad doesnt know what Drawing Donkeys are... go ahead and inform Bad what they are...
16-11-2018T15:24:33,SageSaga,<_< >_>
16-11-2018T15:24:54,BadFoMo,Hahaha!
16-11-2018T15:25:42,BadFoMo,Oh! A map!
16-11-2018T15:27:47,Mippy,"Bad, this is a drawing donkey http://imgur.com/B7pozKz"
16-11-2018T15:29:48,BadFoMo,...Ok.
16-11-2018T15:30:09,SageSaga,"please remember to ask permission to post a link- i'll allow it though because it does explain it-  also i remember those, my grandfather had em in his workshop"
16-11-2018T15:31:48,SageSaga,he used to make them for a drafting class
16-11-2018T15:32:10,SageSaga,he was a carpenter and the vocational school didnt have a lot of money
16-11-2018T15:32:23,Mippy,"Oh, sorry. :csagesaga-c1:"
16-11-2018T15:33:10,Mippy,"But yeah, straddling one of those for three hours is killer"
16-11-2018T15:33:24,SageSaga,"Bad- you sit on the ""donkey"" and the ""Neck"" is where you rest your drawing pad- usually a very large pad"
16-11-2018T15:33:37,SageSaga,and sketch the subject from there
16-11-2018T15:33:49,SageSaga,like a sitting art easel
16-11-2018T15:34:45,BadFoMo,I think I can see it.
16-11-2018T15:35:31,SageSaga,the school i went to didnt use them- we had fancy boards that double as deadly catapults
16-11-2018T15:36:19,SageSaga,they had a spring loaded adjusting system so you could set them at any angle- including straight up- so if you hit the bar on accident with your leg while sitting at it- it would fling up and throw all your art everywhere
16-11-2018T15:36:35,BadFoMo,Cool.
16-11-2018T15:36:52,Mippy,XD What the heck
16-11-2018T15:36:58,SageSaga,it was like having a room full of people seated in front of a bunch of giant mouse traps XD
16-11-2018T15:37:34,SageSaga,few classes for the first week didnt have someone accidentally hitting one and getting pencils or charcoal flung everywhere
16-11-2018T15:38:30,RimaDraws,oh my
16-11-2018T15:39:02,Mippy,Sounds like a good time...for te people who did not do it
16-11-2018T15:39:10,BadFoMo,Got to go.
16-11-2018T15:39:13,SageSaga,you are SUPPOSED to grab and HOLD the handle and slowly adjust and lock it- but if you hit it and take it out of it's holding position it just goes BAM! 90 degrees
16-11-2018T15:39:17,SageSaga,take care
16-11-2018T15:44:06,Tharkis,"lol, we had old wooden desks with spring loaded lids in grade school and we'd turn those into catapaults , or booby trap them for when they did desk inspections"
16-11-2018T15:44:12,Tharkis,teachers were not amused
16-11-2018T15:45:45,sunblaze,good evening
16-11-2018T15:47:26,SageSaga,yo Sunblaze!
16-11-2018T15:53:09,Mippy,Yum! Insta clouds :)
16-11-2018T15:54:27,SageSaga,sometimes they work - sometimes they dont- clouds are weird like that
16-11-2018T15:57:24,Mippy,I'd say it worked nicely in Nyna's panel
16-11-2018T16:01:33,NibblyBot,New Patreon Post: Misc Sketches #1 https://www.patreon.com/posts/misc-sketches-1-22773443
16-11-2018T16:03:15,CatzArt,nibbly on a crab and a taco? I approve of these sketches. have a medal
16-11-2018T16:12:50,SageSaga,man how do i fix this
16-11-2018T16:17:21,CatzArt,no idea. If it was traditional art i could offer advice but digital is beyond me.
16-11-2018T16:17:50,SageSaga,i got it
16-11-2018T16:18:28,SageSaga,there should have been an easier way to do the selections but it didnt work for some reason
16-11-2018T16:19:08,CatzArt,good work. at least in digital its easier to fix mistakes. many times I have ruined and entire piece because i would mess up inking or coloring.
16-11-2018T16:19:25,Twokinds,:ptv-greetings:
16-11-2018T16:19:38,Mippy,Hi Tom!
16-11-2018T16:19:38,CatzArt,Hi tom.
16-11-2018T16:19:40,sunblaze,hi Tom
16-11-2018T16:19:42,SageSaga,yo Tom
16-11-2018T16:20:05,SageSaga,"Catz, so learn digital?"
16-11-2018T16:20:32,Bgrmystr2,heya tom
16-11-2018T16:20:59,CatzArt,I have a Wacom intuos Draw tablet and Gimp 2 but I wanna get better at art in general first before i commit more time to learning digital
16-11-2018T16:21:39,CatzArt,Although i just picked up a free drawing software called Krita which i hope to try out.
16-11-2018T16:21:41,SageSaga,well the skills are kinda interchangeable - though i recommend getting Clip studio when it goes on sale instead of using Gimp
16-11-2018T16:22:09,CatzArt,What about photoshop or is clip better overall?
16-11-2018T16:22:52,SageSaga,Photoshop is great but not really meant for drawing free hand- its gotten better but Clip is cheaper and made for illustrating as well as painting
16-11-2018T16:23:59,SageSaga,i used Photoshop for many years
16-11-2018T16:24:15,SageSaga,when i switched to Clip I lost one thing i still wish i had
16-11-2018T16:24:21,SageSaga,Spell Check XD
16-11-2018T16:25:01,CatzArt,"okay, if I ever make the switch to digital Ill pick it up. Most likely ill just scan and upload my traditional line art first then color it digitally. I still havent gotten used to drawing while looking at a screen. Spell check is nice"
16-11-2018T16:25:58,SageSaga,that can be tough to get used to - but you could also get a screen tablet
16-11-2018T16:26:25,Twokinds,"Just get the new 32"" cintiq!"
16-11-2018T16:26:37,SageSaga,did that come out?
16-11-2018T16:27:21,Mippy,I wish I had the money to get a screan tablet XD Most of what I have is going to school right now
16-11-2018T16:27:21,Twokinds,I don't know. I saw a review of it published just two days ago.
16-11-2018T16:27:22,SageSaga,im hooked on Wacom for now but i would recommend the other brands for beginners and price
16-11-2018T16:27:25,CatzArt,but im really cheap XD. If art ever becomes my full time job ill do that. But still would have hated to waste a degree in Natural resources management for nothing.
16-11-2018T16:27:53,Twokinds,The 24 is a bargain at only $2000!
16-11-2018T16:28:07,Bgrmystr2,good god
16-11-2018T16:28:11,Bgrmystr2,2 grand
16-11-2018T16:28:16,CatzArt,oww 2 grand
16-11-2018T16:28:29,Mippy,XD Maybe in the summer...it would still take some saving
16-11-2018T16:28:35,CatzArt,my wacom draw was like 80 bucks
16-11-2018T16:28:39,Twokinds,(Stand sold seperately)
16-11-2018T16:28:51,CatzArt,are batteries included XD
16-11-2018T16:29:01,SageSaga,the moble studio pro 16 is only 3k
16-11-2018T16:29:08,Twokinds,That would take a lot of batteries.
16-11-2018T16:29:34,SageSaga,hmm - is an i7 worth the extra 900 dollars-
16-11-2018T16:29:44,Mippy,Catz...I ahve one of those...actually...I think I have the comics vertion :ctwokinds-floraquestion:
16-11-2018T16:30:14,CatzArt,mine is the Wacom Intuos Draw. the light blue one.
16-11-2018T16:30:39,CatzArt,I like it because it feels like im drawing on paper and not a glass screen
16-11-2018T16:30:47,Tharkis,"i dont draw, but i should see if i can convince my work to get me one of the DELL Canvas 27"" things to drag around places and let artists use lol"
16-11-2018T16:30:53,Mippy,Excuse me while I did my box out from under my bed
16-11-2018T16:31:01,Tharkis,they've got one sitting in the office near me in their 'demo lab' and no one even touches the thing
16-11-2018T16:32:09,Mippy,"Nope , I've got the Intuos Art"
16-11-2018T16:32:10,SageSaga,i want this https://us-store.wacom.com/product/wacom-mobilestudio-16-S01#/undefined1
16-11-2018T16:33:15,Tharkis,i know someone with the 13 inch i5 model of that
16-11-2018T16:33:29,Tharkis,"and they like it, but said the batteries dont last long, so take the power cable with you everywhere"
16-11-2018T16:33:36,CatzArt,Oww sage that huts my wallet just looking at it
16-11-2018T16:33:48,SageSaga,mine too Catz...
16-11-2018T16:34:03,SageSaga,if it didnt i would have one already XD
16-11-2018T16:34:03,Mippy,Dayam! That is nice
16-11-2018T16:34:13,CatzArt,https://www.wacom.com/en/products/pen-tablets/intuos-draw Here is what I got.
16-11-2018T16:35:22,SageSaga,quick note Catz- the rules are not to post links without permission
16-11-2018T16:35:59,CatzArt,ah did not know that. I really should see if there is a rule list somewhere
16-11-2018T16:36:19,SageSaga,"its just a safety rule, a while back we had someone come in and post a bunch of links to viruses"
16-11-2018T16:36:42,Bgrmystr2,"the rule list is under the stream, yeah?"
16-11-2018T16:36:49,SageSaga,so i decided- screw it- the rule is if you want to post a link- ask and say what it is- if i say ok then post it
16-11-2018T16:37:11,SageSaga,yeah its under the stream
16-11-2018T16:37:38,Mippy,I just got the cheepest one avalible at Best Buy at the time because I ddi not know if I would like didgital and did not want to spend a fortune to try it. I'll eventually get a better one.
16-11-2018T16:37:40,CatzArt,"Oh that sounds awful. Okay , is it under the stream? I shall look. I remember in one of toms streams we had a guy come in and post the same long text chain over and over again."
16-11-2018T16:38:09,CatzArt,and every time we blocked him he would make a new account and come back
16-11-2018T16:38:31,SageSaga,yeah
16-11-2018T16:40:02,CatzArt,okay I found the rules had to jump from toms pictaro page where im watching from to yours so i could scoll down to see the rules list
16-11-2018T16:40:43,SageSaga,it's a simple rule set
16-11-2018T16:40:49,CatzArt,also that map looks like the skyrim one on my wall.
16-11-2018T16:41:31,SageSaga,well it should look like a game map XD
16-11-2018T16:41:38,SageSaga,but it is of course not Skyrim
16-11-2018T16:42:18,CatzArt,"I almost never scroll down so thats why I didnt see it. sorry about that. Tom howard would say it is skyrim. that game is on everthing, amazon alexa and even in your comic XD"
16-11-2018T16:42:46,CatzArt,you cant escape it till ES 6 comes out
16-11-2018T16:43:14,SageSaga,well Tom Howard can take his sexy leather jacket and go elsewhere!. . . which i think is a place in Elder Scrolls still
16-11-2018T16:44:16,SageSaga,Todd*
16-11-2018T16:44:23,SageSaga,Todd Howard- my mistake
16-11-2018T16:45:50,CatzArt,yep Eslweyr is the home of the Khajiit (cat folk). A land of rocky canyons and dusty badlands where the sun shines warmly always.
16-11-2018T16:46:52,CatzArt,I know to much elder scrolls lore for my own good. heck even the setting for a story im working on takes inspiration from the Elder scrolls and fall out.
16-11-2018T16:48:06,SageSaga,"Guard- ""Yeah so i was beating this Khajiit because I asked him where he came from and he got smart with me and said Elsewhere, and i said 'I know you arent from here but i asked where you came from!- and he kept saying ""Elsewhere""! So I hit him -"""
16-11-2018T16:49:06,SageSaga,"""Dude! The Khajiit are from a LAND called ""Elsweyr!"""
16-11-2018T16:49:10,sunblaze,thats just mean :D despite the fact that he did not lie :D
16-11-2018T16:50:04,SageSaga,"Guard - ""Wha-? Oh... Oh! Well... haha- its kinda funny now that you think about it right?"" ""No dude, no it's not"" ""*Sigh* im gonna go to his cell and apologize"""
16-11-2018T16:51:42,CatzArt,"the reason for the name in lore came from a khajiit proverb ""Peace is always found elsewhere"" so the name was chosen when the two main khajiit kingdoms united"
16-11-2018T16:52:28,CatzArt,its sad that i know this. thats what i get for reading every in game book all 200+ of them.
16-11-2018T16:53:11,sunblaze,polish my spear maid! :D
16-11-2018T16:53:31,sunblaze,god that guy was as smug as he was dirty
16-11-2018T16:53:32,SageSaga,"""So, how did it go?"" ""He says his name is M'aiq the Liar, but now i wonder if that's just a lie..."""
16-11-2018T16:53:34,sunblaze,loved him D:
16-11-2018T16:54:04,CatzArt,The loaf must be given time to rise before being put in the oven. Lusty argoanian maid for the win!
16-11-2018T16:55:12,CatzArt,Still in game my favorite series of books is the A Dance in Fire series.
16-11-2018T16:55:57,sunblaze,"true yeah imho Barenziah and her ""uncensored"" book were even dirtier"
16-11-2018T16:56:28,sunblaze,but not as smug as Crassius Curio was himself
16-11-2018T16:57:19,Tharkis,"hrm, what are the 'must do' things in chicago?  Last time i went to the zoo, saw the 'bean' at night, walked the navy pie, ate at Giodarno's for pizza"
16-11-2018T16:57:31,Tharkis,trying to make a list of things to do when i'm there in a couple weeks =P
16-11-2018T16:58:45,CatzArt,ive never been there. Ive been stuck in Ohio most of my life.
16-11-2018T17:00:32,Mippy,The only thing I know about Chicago is pizza and mobsters
16-11-2018T17:00:47,CatzArt,"If your ever in that part of the states try Put-in-Bay island. CLeveland is an okay city when its not falling apart, the south eastern side has nice hills but little else unless you like coal mines and the capital has my college. not much else."
16-11-2018T17:01:43,CatzArt,Chicago has speak easies from prohibition which are cool
16-11-2018T17:02:50,Mippy,:ctwokinds-karenOOO: Historical
16-11-2018T17:04:08,FoxxTrotter,Capone. :0)
16-11-2018T17:05:05,Mippy,"I love old things, historical thigs, ect. Growing up in Nova Scotia we had a lot of that"
16-11-2018T17:05:09,Tharkis,the mobster museum in vegas was fun to visit
16-11-2018T17:05:56,Mippy,^ I'll have to visit that if I'm ever in Vegas
16-11-2018T17:06:33,CatzArt,Isnt Nova Scotia where the vikings landed in the new world?
16-11-2018T17:06:58,Mippy,New Found Land actually XD Good guess though
16-11-2018T17:07:06,FoxxTrotter,Close enough.
16-11-2018T17:07:15,FoxxTrotter,Canuckland.
16-11-2018T17:07:44,Mippy,Many would argue with you on that Foxx
16-11-2018T17:07:58,FoxxTrotter,Go Leafs.
16-11-2018T17:08:04,Mippy,"We do have the Titanic graves though, Catz"
16-11-2018T17:09:13,CatzArt,The only part of Canada Ive ever been to is Niagra falls. ohh when the movie Titanic came out i remember people going to the graves because there is a crew member aboard the ship with the same name as the main character who died
16-11-2018T17:10:02,Tharkis,canadian side of the falls is a lot nicer than the american side hehe
16-11-2018T17:10:16,FoxxTrotter,I haven't been to Niagara Falls in about 15 years.
16-11-2018T17:10:32,FoxxTrotter,Also went to Toronto that year.
16-11-2018T17:10:35,Mippy,God I hate that movie. I get asked about Jack and Rose and when I explain that they were fictional characters...it's a tad awkward
16-11-2018T17:11:06,SageSaga,you should make up stuff then
16-11-2018T17:11:30,FoxxTrotter,"That's when they had the fast ferry going between Toronto and Rochester. The project was short lived, though."
16-11-2018T17:11:54,SageSaga,"""Ah yes- what the movie didnt tell you is it was actuall Jack and Ross not Rose... those two homosexuals... their story stolen by cinema"
16-11-2018T17:12:23,CatzArt,Tharkis is right about the canadian side being nicer. the falls are important in my major as an example of what happens to ecological wonders when they arent made into parks.
16-11-2018T17:12:25,Mippy,I think I would have like that movie better XD
16-11-2018T17:12:57,FoxxTrotter,I need to go back to MarineLand sometime. Haven't been there since 1987.
16-11-2018T17:13:19,CatzArt,marine land? is it made out of US marines?
16-11-2018T17:13:42,FoxxTrotter,"MarineLand is a theme park in Niagara Falls, similar to Sea World."
16-11-2018T17:13:57,FoxxTrotter,It's on the Canadian side.
16-11-2018T17:14:29,Mippy,It'ss a experiamce where you get to go pretend to be a Marine for a day. Everyone loves MarineLand
16-11-2018T17:15:04,FoxxTrotter,The Metro Toronto Zoo was real nice as well.
16-11-2018T17:15:08,CatzArt,"Oh cool. but I'm not a fan of those kinda parks, animal cruelty and all that."
16-11-2018T17:15:19,CatzArt,the zoo sounds nice though
16-11-2018T17:15:28,FoxxTrotter,"Canada's Wonderland is also in Toronto, but we never went to that."
16-11-2018T17:15:39,FoxxTrotter,Another theme park.
16-11-2018T17:15:51,Mippy,"Yeah, I've never been myself. I was only breifly in Toronto."
16-11-2018T17:16:09,Mippy,I slept in a parking lot though
16-11-2018T17:16:41,CatzArt,"At the Cleveland zoo in my home town, they just built the new Asian Highlands. we have snow leopard cubs, red pandas and all sorts of things. I wont post a link to it but if you ever have time to look it up its a nice exhibit."
16-11-2018T17:17:07,FoxxTrotter,Darien Lake in western New York is operated by Six Flags again. I need to check that out later when I go back up there.
16-11-2018T17:17:13,Mippy,^ What happend to animal crulty
16-11-2018T17:17:46,Mippy,SIX FLAGS IS STILL A THING?! I haven't seen a commercial for them in years
16-11-2018T17:18:18,FoxxTrotter,The closest theme parks to me are King's Dominion and Carowinds. Haven't been to either one of them yet.
16-11-2018T17:18:22,Tharkis,"awww, i want my zoo to get snow leopard cubs"
16-11-2018T17:18:27,CatzArt,what about animal cruelty? Sea world keeps animals in too small tanks. I think Ohio used to have a six flags But was ousted by Ceder point.
16-11-2018T17:18:38,FoxxTrotter,Paramount operated both of them about ten years ago.
16-11-2018T17:18:51,Tharkis,akron zoo had cubs but i missed them the last time i visited there
16-11-2018T17:19:12,Tharkis,did get good photos of the mamma though
16-11-2018T17:19:38,Mippy,Zoos Catz....They are not always the most well cared for either
16-11-2018T17:19:41,CatzArt,Maybe they will tharkis I think the older cubs will be sent to other zoos as part of the captive breeding program. akron zoo is nice. I like the Columbus zoo best It has the best designed enclosures Ive ever seen
16-11-2018T17:20:07,Mippy,But anya
16-11-2018T17:20:17,Mippy,*anyway
16-11-2018T17:20:50,CatzArt,I know what you what you mean Mippy. its gotten better and the standards for exhibits has improved along with animal care
16-11-2018T17:21:42,CatzArt,"I'll be back I must get some food, I'm coming my beloved microwave dinners!"
16-11-2018T17:23:21,Mippy,I can't remember the last time I had a microwave dinner. Maybe I should pick up a Hungry Man or a Swanson
16-11-2018T17:23:52,SageSaga,im almost done
16-11-2018T17:24:14,Mippy,ok
16-11-2018T17:27:21,SageSaga,annnd there we go
16-11-2018T17:27:24,SageSaga,all done!
16-11-2018T17:28:01,Bgrmystr2,nicely done :O
16-11-2018T17:28:07,SageSaga,now i get to run out to the store and get food and cook it before the Dungeons and Dragons game
16-11-2018T17:28:23,Twokinds,Good luck
16-11-2018T17:28:27,Mippy,NIce
16-11-2018T17:28:29,Twokinds,Nice page!
16-11-2018T17:28:35,SageSaga,thanks Tom ^_^
16-11-2018T17:28:54,SageSaga,also the new store is open! So i dont have to drive 17 miles to get food anymore
16-11-2018T17:29:12,Mippy,Love the boob shine bottom right
16-11-2018T17:29:58,FoxxTrotter,:0)
16-11-2018T17:30:02,Mippy,I don't know how far a mile is but that seems excessive
16-11-2018T17:30:21,FoxxTrotter,"5,280 ft."
16-11-2018T17:30:52,SageSaga,27 Kilometers
16-11-2018T17:31:21,Mippy,"Ok, Thaanks."
16-11-2018T17:32:08,CatzArt,im back nice page sage
16-11-2018T17:32:14,SageSaga,i dont know why Foxx would think converting imperial into imperial would help XD
16-11-2018T17:32:30,FoxxTrotter,Mippy also said one mile. ;0P
16-11-2018T17:32:35,FoxxTrotter,1.6 km
16-11-2018T17:32:56,CatzArt,because imperial is better than metric. because the USA uses it makes it better DX
16-11-2018T17:33:01,FoxxTrotter,"But yes, what Sage said is correct."
16-11-2018T17:33:15,Mippy,XD I'm like...Give me a laandmark to compare to
16-11-2018T17:33:40,SpazztasticKiwi,At least 6 horse
16-11-2018T17:33:44,FoxxTrotter,"Thanks for the stream, Sage."
16-11-2018T17:33:46,SageSaga,take care folks! Thanks for joining
16-11-2018T17:34:02,Bgrmystr2,thanks for streamin sage :D
16-11-2018T17:34:04,Mippy,"Yeaah, thanks. It was nice to wattch a whole one"
16-11-2018T17:34:05,CatzArt,Thanks for the stream. Next time can we get a river?
16-11-2018T17:34:19,Bgrmystr2,those are fridays.
16-11-2018T17:34:27,FoxxTrotter,Not here. The waters are a bit high at the moment.
16-11-2018T17:34:55,CatzArt,but is not a stream a rivers tributary?
16-11-2018T17:35:27,FoxxTrotter,Normally.
16-11-2018T17:36:22,CatzArt,Ah well I guess thats it for tonight. As much as i would love to regal you with my aquatics know how there is work to be done. Have a good afternoon all!
16-11-2018T17:37:24,FoxxTrotter,"Later, everyone. :0)"
16-11-2018T17:49:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I am finally on lunch
16-11-2018T17:56:50,Dadrobit,Just got back from the Phoenix Reptile Expo.
16-11-2018T17:57:08,Dadrobit,Was fun. Lots of ludicrously expensive animals.
16-11-2018T18:05:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"I remember going to a flea market in Tupelo. A lady sold exotic pets - like these miniature, thumb size monkeys"
16-11-2018T18:05:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"$5,000 each"
16-11-2018T18:07:01,Dadrobit,"No thumb sized monkeys, but lots of albino and off-color reptiles for similar prices and more."
16-11-2018T18:07:22,Dadrobit,Saw one going for 15k because it was a female breeder.
16-11-2018T18:08:20,Dadrobit,"Got to hold one of those Pac Man frogs too, funny lookin litter fellers."
16-11-2018T18:08:26,Dadrobit,little*
16-11-2018T18:10:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I got one
16-11-2018T18:11:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Peeka’s full grown though. They likely had babies
16-11-2018T18:11:28,Dadrobit,"Yeah, s'why I asked to hold one, remembered that was your frog when I passed by a booth with a couple."
16-11-2018T18:11:53,Dadrobit,$30-$60 across the lot.
16-11-2018T18:12:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve held Peeka before. You just have to be careful about the mouth. They have teeth and don’t believe in letting go
16-11-2018T18:12:48,Dadrobit,"They varied. Some were half dollar circumference, some a bit smaller than my fist."
16-11-2018T18:12:49,SpazztasticKiwi,And always make sure your hands are clean #1
16-11-2018T18:13:15,Dadrobit,"Yeah, that was something the guy mentioned."
16-11-2018T18:13:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Babies (that aren’t tadpoles) are about quarter to half dollar size
16-11-2018T18:13:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Little angry beady eyes
16-11-2018T18:13:57,SpazztasticKiwi,So precious
16-11-2018T18:14:00,Dadrobit,"He knew which one of them was ""the chill one"""
16-11-2018T18:15:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"I got Peeka from a girl who was getting rid of a few exotics because she was moving. She didn’t even know Peeka was a girl, let alone had bothered giving her a name"
16-11-2018T18:15:09,Dadrobit,"Another booth was trying to sell a giant water monitor for $200 (super cheap). Asked him why the price was so low. ""Because he's a little turd and I'm tired of dealing with his drama."""
16-11-2018T18:15:40,SpazztasticKiwi,“Reason for sale: he’s a little sh$&”
16-11-2018T18:17:24,Dadrobit,He was a big boi. About 5 and a half feet snout to tip.
16-11-2018T18:17:32,SpazztasticKiwi,And something I’ve seen about frogs in general is that what they amount to be is a mouth with just enough leg to launch said mouth at food
16-11-2018T18:18:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t have an interest in the big reptiles. My sister has the dragons and geckos
16-11-2018T18:18:55,Dadrobit,I was mostly there for my little brother. He absolutely loves reptiles.
16-11-2018T18:19:16,Dadrobit,And it was only $10 for the two day expo.
16-11-2018T18:19:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’d try for an emperor scorpion, but no one else wants that in the house"
16-11-2018T18:19:41,Dadrobit,And I have just enough self control to not drop $60 on a wee snake for myself.
16-11-2018T18:20:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I like the little guys. Aim on finding myself another snake sometime
16-11-2018T18:20:26,Dadrobit,"Ohhh, they had some of those as well. Badass looking little monsters."
16-11-2018T18:20:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Hognose maybe. Tiny boopable nose
16-11-2018T18:20:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t get too big
16-11-2018T18:21:02,Dadrobit,"Hognose are venomous, your state allows?"
16-11-2018T18:21:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Hognose isn’t venomous
16-11-2018T18:22:08,Dadrobit,"""Their saliva meets the definition of a venom since it is toxic to small prey such as frogs and toads; however, it is not likely to cause serious injury to humans, particularly as hognoses are rear-fanged"""
16-11-2018T18:22:20,SpazztasticKiwi,They have a sedative-like bite yeah
16-11-2018T18:22:34,Dadrobit,Still can make it difficult to acquire based on legislation.
16-11-2018T18:22:35,SpazztasticKiwi,But not like the copperhead or water moccasin
16-11-2018T18:22:45,SpazztasticKiwi,They’re legal
16-11-2018T18:23:29,SpazztasticKiwi,But they’re also shyer snakes. They’re the ones who run or play dead or make themselves stink
16-11-2018T18:24:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, the fangs delivering this “venom” are in the back of the mouth and a hognose has a pretty smol bite. They don’t often get a full mouth but on a human"
16-11-2018T18:24:55,SpazztasticKiwi,bite
16-11-2018T18:25:28,Dadrobit,"Yeah, you have to let them chew on you a bit before it becomes ""dangerous"". About as dangerous as a bee sting."
16-11-2018T18:25:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Om nom nom
16-11-2018T18:26:50,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s also the rat snake but rat snakes are nice but they get like 6+ feet
16-11-2018T18:27:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Or 6ish
16-11-2018T18:28:16,SpazztasticKiwi,And there’s the king snake. I had a garter snake
16-11-2018T18:29:14,Dadrobit,King snakes are suuuuuper docile. Can find some out here turning over rocks when hiking.
16-11-2018T18:29:28,SpazztasticKiwi,“Sup bruh”
16-11-2018T18:29:59,Dadrobit,"Seriously, very handle-able even when totally wild."
16-11-2018T18:30:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I know. We get some around here
16-11-2018T18:30:45,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s mostly the rat snakes though. They always seem so sour
16-11-2018T18:31:45,Dadrobit,Love me some basic boas though. Brother has a Red Tail that's absolutely ginormous now.
16-11-2018T18:32:21,Dadrobit,She's easily 7+ feet and only around 6 years old.
16-11-2018T18:33:59,Dadrobit,Very very calm as well. Only ever saw her even look like she was in a striking mood once after I was helping my brother with his new atrium for her.
16-11-2018T18:34:27,Dadrobit,"So it was kinda stressful for her, understand the mood."
16-11-2018T18:36:00,SpazztasticKiwi,“You come into mah house?!”
16-11-2018T18:36:28,SpazztasticKiwi,King wasn’t a fan of me cleaning his cage

16-11-2018T20:51:52,ThingsAreMoving,"Also, after reading Terra's question and doing some investigation... that male drake (genderbent Nora?)  Is really, really, really hot."
16-11-2018T20:53:09,Combak,"Oh, is THAT who the dragon was?"
16-11-2018T20:53:17,Combak,"Either way, they are very hot."
