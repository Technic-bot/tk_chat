07-08-2018T16:54:59,SpazztasticKiwi,What do you guys use to clean your headphone jack
07-08-2018T16:55:57,Bgrmystr2,"I don't use things like that very much, and honestly the ones I have never get dirty if I use them anyway"
07-08-2018T16:56:23,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. just.. clean it with a towel. It's just metal
07-08-2018T16:56:32,Bgrmystr2,"like, a paper towel"
07-08-2018T16:57:23,Bgrmystr2,"don't get it wet, and don't stick the jack into a plug while wet."
07-08-2018T16:57:38,Bgrmystr2,simple stuff
07-08-2018T16:59:13,Dadrobit,Q-Tip with rubbing alcohol.
07-08-2018T16:59:55,Bgrmystr2,what could possibly get on it that would require that much care xD
07-08-2018T17:35:38,Dadrobit,Dirt and debris can get in the jack. Keeping the contacts clean helps maintain audio quality.
07-08-2018T17:36:46,tehbear,i never had problems with an audio jack itself
07-08-2018T17:37:19,tehbear,usually its the last bit of wire to the plug thats the issue
07-08-2018T17:42:46,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, if they get dirty, imo that's a problem with how it's being kept to begin with"
07-08-2018T17:43:03,Bgrmystr2,but things happen I guess
07-08-2018T17:43:32,Dadrobit,"Or you know, dust gets inside because you live in a goddamned desert."
07-08-2018T17:43:59,Bgrmystr2,wellllll stop living in a desert damned by god? :V
07-08-2018T17:44:06,Bgrmystr2,or somethin
07-08-2018T17:44:08,Bgrmystr2,haha
07-08-2018T17:44:31,Dadrobit,Pray for Arizona https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAtQ3PcnGJY
07-08-2018T17:45:54,Bgrmystr2,it looks like her whole head is sunburned
07-08-2018T17:47:06,JaydenMozingo,Does anybody know an websites that I can save my pictures to?
07-08-2018T17:47:15,tehbear,IMGUR?
07-08-2018T17:47:15,Dadrobit,imjur
07-08-2018T17:47:20,Dadrobit,imgur*****
07-08-2018T17:47:29,JaydenMozingo,Thank you!
07-08-2018T17:47:37,Bgrmystr2,imm grrr
07-08-2018T17:47:44,Dadrobit,DeviantArt if that's your style as well.
07-08-2018T17:48:04,Bgrmystr2,"you can always do photobucket, but you can't hotlink those"
07-08-2018T17:48:59,JaydenMozingo,"Yeah I tried that and when I tried to save it back after a crash, It was blurry. I'm lucky I found it burried in a file"
07-08-2018T17:49:20,Bgrmystr2,prolly didn't get the full file then
07-08-2018T17:49:34,JaydenMozingo,Exactly
07-08-2018T17:49:42,JaydenMozingo,But I remember using Imgur but I forgot the name of the website itself
07-08-2018T17:49:52,JaydenMozingo,I'm noting it. Thank you!
07-08-2018T17:49:55,Bgrmystr2,that's more a problem with where you saved the image rather than the website itself
07-08-2018T17:50:23,tehbear,i imagine some websites compress your image regardless
07-08-2018T17:50:33,JaydenMozingo,Indeed
07-08-2018T17:50:34,Bgrmystr2,"from what I've seen, photobucket doesn't do that"
07-08-2018T17:50:53,Bgrmystr2,all of the ones I uploaded to it are exactly as they were when I uploaded them
07-08-2018T17:51:03,Bgrmystr2,some quite large

07-08-2018T18:47:41,TheGamePlayer,Was up!!!???!!!???!!!
07-08-2018T20:32:45,TheGamePlayer,"I'm getting an iPod 6 for the second time in a bit... The first one someone broke by accident, they knocked it out of my have and its touch screen broke, but I'll be able to make more music again and I'm so happy."
07-08-2018T20:48:47,CrRAR,niiiice
07-08-2018T20:50:06,CrRAR,It's a shame how easy it is to break modern technology.
07-08-2018T20:51:51,CrRAR,"Still gotta send in my phone for a screen repair, first one I ever broke."
07-08-2018T20:52:43,CrRAR,The accidental/applecare coverage is so worth it these days.
07-08-2018T20:54:44,CrRAR,"Three things are certain death, taxes... and shattered screens."
07-08-2018T20:55:02,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-LauraCry:
07-08-2018T21:18:59,Dadrobit,S'why I got the phone that I have. Screen is just this side of indestructible.
07-08-2018T21:26:47,CrRAR,:ok_hand:
07-08-2018T21:27:25,CrRAR,What'chu have?
07-08-2018T21:28:07,Dadrobit,Droid Turbo 2
07-08-2018T21:28:47,Dadrobit,"Battery life is tanking as of late, but it's durable as all get out."
07-08-2018T21:29:50,CrRAR,Yeah it looks like it has a lip around the edge... def very protective.
07-08-2018T21:30:12,CrRAR,My Samsung S6 was like that.
07-08-2018T21:31:13,Dadrobit,"I think it's more to do with the protective layers they have going on, something like 5 different layers over the screen."
07-08-2018T21:31:54,Dadrobit,"Watching all the durability tests on YouTube, it's always the lcd that gives out before the glass."
07-08-2018T21:32:26,Dadrobit,There's one by I think CNET where they drove over it with a forklift and it was still totally fine.
07-08-2018T21:32:52,CrRAR,"That's pretty legit, it takes some serious trauma to compromise the LCD itself."
07-08-2018T21:34:35,CrRAR,Yeah the newer phones just like to extend the glass around the edges kinda like the force touch screens on iphones.
07-08-2018T21:34:47,CrRAR,Screen protectors don't even fit em good.
07-08-2018T21:36:03,CrRAR,"My Pixel 2 is like that... and I don't believe a word they say when they ""improve"" gorilla glass. lol"
07-08-2018T21:36:29,Dadrobit,Just looked it up. No glass to be found in the screen. All polycarbonate plastics in layers that each do something. Then it's all reinforced by a thick aluminum case.
07-08-2018T21:36:39,CrRAR,oooo
07-08-2018T21:37:44,Dadrobit,So it's essentially totally shatterproof.
07-08-2018T21:38:16,Dadrobit,"Though you can scratch the screen more easily than glass, I don't have an issue with that."
07-08-2018T21:38:38,Dadrobit,Since I have a full case otterbox to top it off.
07-08-2018T21:39:19,CrRAR,"Yeah, just an extra layer keeps it safe forever."
07-08-2018T21:40:04,CrRAR,I did alright with my old Nexus 5X.
07-08-2018T21:41:03,CrRAR,Just got hella slow with all the new security/software... and the battery did start to suck.
07-08-2018T21:41:13,CrRAR,I almost bought a Motorola like a year ago too when there was a special on them
07-08-2018T21:41:18,Dadrobit,I do enough metalworking stuffs that I don't want any risk of it breaking because of an accident in that kind of an atmosphere.
07-08-2018T21:42:09,CrRAR,Yeah
07-08-2018T21:43:31,Dadrobit,"This was actually my first smart phone, everything before was all flip phones."
07-08-2018T21:44:09,CrRAR,"Haha, before the 5X I was on flips too."
07-08-2018T21:44:56,CrRAR,Though I did have an old HTC Desire that I essentially used as an iPod before that.
07-08-2018T21:45:14,JDH,"so i start a drafting and desgine degree on monday, anyone have that or any advise?"
07-08-2018T21:45:41,CrRAR,Hmm
07-08-2018T21:46:14,Mippy,:cake:
07-08-2018T21:47:18,CrRAR,"That's excellent, stay diligent and don't be afraid to ask questions, or buddy/group up for the tough stuff."
07-08-2018T21:47:49,Dadrobit,Is this your first time in college?
07-08-2018T21:48:38,JDH,"first time college, no, im 28 and trying to get my crap together lol i have a brother did this and makes good money so i figured hey why not"
07-08-2018T21:48:38,Dadrobit,(I took a year and a half of video game design courses at ASU myself. Lots of general design classes in there.)
07-08-2018T21:49:16,JDH,i have half a film production degree then decided i would rather do as a hobby than proffession
07-08-2018T21:50:55,JDH,he gave me his advise but im open for anything
07-08-2018T21:52:03,Dadrobit,So when you say drafting/design. Is that as in architectural drafting? Or prototype drafting?
07-08-2018T21:52:37,Dadrobit,Or something else of course?
07-08-2018T21:53:11,JDH,the title is Drafting and Design Tech.
07-08-2018T21:53:37,Mippy,"Sorry, don'tt think I can offer much help. I'm a art student. :shrug:"
07-08-2018T21:54:23,JDH,"mippy, i can somewhat draw...if you give me like two weeks and im feeling the image lol"
07-08-2018T21:55:10,Dadrobit,"Hmm, dunno how applicable my design learning experience is either then lol."
07-08-2018T21:55:41,Mippy,"Well, somewhat is better than can't"
07-08-2018T21:55:43,JDH,"eh, im sure ill be fine"
07-08-2018T21:55:52,JDH,true
07-08-2018T21:56:09,Dadrobit,"Most of what I dealt in was the theory of design, but I'm guessing the ""Tech"" part of that degree means a lot of working in CAD."
07-08-2018T21:57:17,Dadrobit,Keeping journals and observing the minutae of the design decisions of everyday objects that I dealt with kind of stuff.
07-08-2018T21:57:53,JDH,yeah two classes in cad
07-08-2018T22:00:40,Dadrobit,"Yeah, dig into that stuff hard. CAD is crazy useful skillset to have."
07-08-2018T22:02:45,Dadrobit,"And learn your hotkeys lol. If you have to waste time in a right-click drop down menu all the time, then you're going to be seen as slow and replaceable, even if your fianl product is #Quality"
07-08-2018T22:02:58,Dadrobit,Final*
07-08-2018T22:03:39,TheBeckoner,Neat y'all are talking about this. Im modeling some stuffs right now.
07-08-2018T22:11:51,Dadrobit,"I'm afraid beyond telling you to study hard, I don't have much for you beyond that. My classes were all stuff like, Media Editing, Prototyping Dreams, Computational Thinking for Digital Culture kind of stuff."
07-08-2018T22:12:44,Dadrobit,"(As an aside, I would like to go back and finish that course line one day)"
07-08-2018T22:12:59,Dadrobit,(When I'm rich and have a bunch of free time)
07-08-2018T22:13:50,TorqueEmUp,So many better things to do when you are rich and have free time then go to school. :P
07-08-2018T22:14:13,Dadrobit,:/ I like learning stuff
07-08-2018T22:14:19,Mippy,^
07-08-2018T22:14:57,Dadrobit,I got to sit around and make games with people all day.
07-08-2018T22:15:03,Dadrobit,It was a good time.
07-08-2018T22:15:27,Dadrobit,Lots of weed to.
07-08-2018T22:15:33,Dadrobit,"Like, so much."
07-08-2018T22:15:56,Dadrobit,It was a grand time indeed.
07-08-2018T22:17:01,Dadrobit,too*
07-08-2018T22:17:53,TorqueEmUp,I'd rather travel if I was rich.
07-08-2018T22:18:16,Dadrobit,"Alas and alack, poor decision making on my part lead me to dropping out in my second year. So yeah, focus and work ethic. Indispensable skills."
07-08-2018T22:18:27,Mippy,"Travel is on my ""to do list"""
07-08-2018T22:21:01,TorqueEmUp,Guess I'
07-08-2018T22:21:10,TheBeckoner,I tend to lack focus
07-08-2018T22:21:33,TorqueEmUp,"I lack focus, motivation, and I hate being told what to do. :P"
07-08-2018T22:22:01,TorqueEmUp,"Let me learn it at my own pace, don't try to force it down my throat by ""Talking"""
07-08-2018T22:22:25,TorqueEmUp,I am a very anti-school person
07-08-2018T22:23:54,TorqueEmUp,"I can't absorb much of anything through talking, and taking notes."
07-08-2018T22:24:38,TorqueEmUp,"Unless I am very interested and engaged in the subject matter. If things start to get too technical, my brain shuts off."
07-08-2018T22:25:46,TorqueEmUp,"Teach me, but don't test and and expect me to do work. lol"
07-08-2018T22:25:52,TorqueEmUp,test me*
07-08-2018T22:26:06,TorqueEmUp,*Is a lazy bastard*
07-08-2018T22:26:44,TorqueEmUp,"and because of my attitude, I will be stuck doing low paying jobs the rest of my life, because that is a barrier I just can't get past."
07-08-2018T22:27:12,TorqueEmUp,Trust me i've tried to apply myself. I fizzle out in a few weeks.
07-08-2018T22:27:32,Mippy,Well...good luck with that :shrug:
07-08-2018T22:28:36,Mippy,XD
07-08-2018T22:29:16,TorqueEmUp,and I've got an attitude where I want to drag people down with me. lol
07-08-2018T22:29:42,Mippy,:clap:
07-08-2018T22:30:32,Mippy,I burned my tongue on bean water
07-08-2018T22:31:55,TorqueEmUp,an attitude I greatly need to change.
07-08-2018T22:32:29,Dadrobit,:/ Used to hate taking notes and listening to professors without doing much of anything. Had to change that when I got into audio engineering.
07-08-2018T22:33:07,TheBeckoner,"I prefer my own way too, but im not unwilling to learn i dont think."
07-08-2018T22:33:22,TheBeckoner,Just spend the day with some nice old people and you can learn a lot
07-08-2018T22:33:35,TorqueEmUp,"I don't mind listening so much, I don't mind learning. Like I said, if it's subject matter I care for."
07-08-2018T22:33:48,TorqueEmUp,But don't expect me to take notes.
07-08-2018T22:33:55,Dadrobit,Turns out most professors are nice old people you can learn a lot from.
07-08-2018T22:34:23,TheBeckoner,Usually
07-08-2018T22:34:31,TorqueEmUp,"Don't expect me to do complicated projects, or write papers."
07-08-2018T22:34:41,Dadrobit,"Oh man, had one professor named Scott. I think he'd straight up tell you to drop out. You'd be fucked."
07-08-2018T22:35:12,Dadrobit,Went through three full front and back notebooks in a single class with him.
07-08-2018T22:35:57,TorqueEmUp,"And this is why I didn't go to school, because it'd be a large waste of my money. lol"
07-08-2018T22:36:05,Dadrobit,"Very no nonsense, but super smart guy. The industry is cut throat, so he enforced that kind of mentality in the class."
07-08-2018T22:36:57,TorqueEmUp,Which is why I didn't want to get into any tech fields.
07-08-2018T22:37:14,Dadrobit,The trick went with was to just roll with the punches and shot back when you can. Ended up on very friendly terms with him by the end.
07-08-2018T22:37:17,TheBeckoner,I can understand that in college and do. I hate when highschool teacher are super hard on kids like that though.
07-08-2018T22:37:20,Dadrobit,I went with*
07-08-2018T22:38:05,TorqueEmUp,"I pissed my high school teachers off. Because I knew that shit was pointless, but I was bringing their class averages down, and they HATED that."
07-08-2018T22:38:49,Dadrobit,They don't care about your grades tbh. They care that your toxicity is going to affect the grades of everyone around you.
07-08-2018T22:39:30,Dadrobit,"Don't get me wrong, the teachers care about everyone, but when one or two start spoiling the whole batch, that's what they really take issue with."
07-08-2018T22:40:35,TorqueEmUp,"I wasn't actively trying to keep others from their work. I just slept. If that was effecting others grades, well that wasn't my intention. I just didn't care."
07-08-2018T22:40:35,Dadrobit,"Waste your time listening to music in the back, but don't take the opportunity for learning away from the other students."
07-08-2018T22:41:13,TorqueEmUp,"Like I just said, I kept to myself."
07-08-2018T22:41:56,TorqueEmUp,Then just soared through the high school course through a computer based school.
07-08-2018T22:42:01,TorqueEmUp,courses*
07-08-2018T22:42:12,TorqueEmUp,and got my High School diploma that way
07-08-2018T22:44:37,TorqueEmUp,A relatively worthless thing in the grand scheme of things.
07-08-2018T22:47:18,TorqueEmUp,"Maybe I'll get lucky, and hit it big off something. Or I will regret my decisions in old age."
07-08-2018T22:48:32,TorqueEmUp,"I realize I ain't going to change the world. I don't have much to offer humanity. We all live, we all die. You are well forgotton about only 2-3 generations after you die."
07-08-2018T22:48:45,Dadrobit,You'll probably regret it :D
07-08-2018T22:49:29,Dadrobit,Fuck that. I'm gonna keep working my ass off. Dadrobit is a name that's going down in the annals of history!
07-08-2018T22:49:34,TheBeckoner,Well darn I figure I'll try to excel at anything I do and hopefully that takes me somewhere.
07-08-2018T22:49:45,TheBeckoner,Heck yeah Robit
07-08-2018T22:49:50,Dadrobit,\o/
07-08-2018T22:50:04,TorqueEmUp,And I wish you goodluck with that.
07-08-2018T22:50:09,Dadrobit,Gracias
07-08-2018T22:50:09,TorqueEmUp,and I seriously mean that
07-08-2018T22:50:11,TheBeckoner,"It would be neat to be known by people if possible, but if not then o well atleast I tried"
07-08-2018T22:50:31,Mippy,Dang...I have a tight weenis
07-08-2018T22:50:35,TheBeckoner,a wot

07-08-2018T22:51:02,Dadrobit,Be back in a bit. Gonna go get something to eat.
07-08-2018T22:51:02,TheBeckoner,"thats not the actual term for it, is it?"
07-08-2018T22:51:14,TheBeckoner,May the food be lit
07-08-2018T22:52:54,Mippy,It's a slang term for the flap of skin at the back of the elbow
