30-10-2018T00:11:36,RimaDraws,night all
30-10-2018T00:57:10,Dadrobit,Fuck. Sorry for bouncing real quick. But life just got a bit eventful all the sudden.
30-10-2018T00:58:03,Dadrobit,Sister came over with a safe and some of her valuables to keep at my place. She just got through agreeing to divorce her husband again.
30-10-2018T00:58:17,Dadrobit,"I'm the first to know, and she was kind of a mess."
30-10-2018T00:59:50,Dadrobit,"Says it's halfway amicable, but she wouldn't put it past the dude to nick some of her stuff if he found the chance before he moves out."
30-10-2018T01:01:15,Bgrmystr2,"oh, is that the one that was having issues"
30-10-2018T01:01:25,Dadrobit,Whole ordeal is a situation of 3 metric tons of horseshit about to hit some industrial grade fans.
30-10-2018T01:01:49,Dadrobit,He's the fuckead I considered murdering before. Yes.
30-10-2018T01:02:01,Dadrobit,fuckhead*
30-10-2018T01:02:04,Bgrmystr2,"Well, at least she's getting away from him"
30-10-2018T01:02:07,Bgrmystr2,which is good
30-10-2018T01:02:31,Bgrmystr2,is she going to cite the stuff he did in the reasons for divorce? :o
30-10-2018T01:03:24,Dadrobit,"I don't know the nitty-gritty of the arrangement, all I know is that so far they're agreeing to 50/50 custody time, and she keeps thehouse."
30-10-2018T01:03:47,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: I wish her the best man
30-10-2018T01:04:19,Dadrobit,"But the house is a bit fucked because he's been ""remodeling"" it for the last year and it's missing a bunch of shit. like an exterior wall on the back. And there are open pipes everywhere."
30-10-2018T01:04:47,Bgrmystr2,that's all stuff that can be noted in the divorce papers too
30-10-2018T01:05:00,Dadrobit,"Yeah, we talked about that."
30-10-2018T01:06:08,Dadrobit,"She's not emotionally okay right now, so I'm not putting a ton of extra pressure on her to do some stuff yet, but I got her to agree to not sign anything yet until she gets her own attorney on it."
30-10-2018T01:06:32,Bgrmystr2,good
30-10-2018T01:09:00,Dadrobit,"And yeah unsteddy, it's kinda competitive. Looking at some open jobs on voices.com right now for example, there's one that was posted just two hours ago and already it has 50 auditions applied for it."

30-10-2018T09:52:57,iliar,"Good morning, Tom!"

30-10-2018T09:53:23,Twokinds,Today is the day
30-10-2018T09:53:27,Twokinds,ALL HALLOW'S EVE
30-10-2018T09:53:50,Twokinds,:bat::bat::bat::bat::bat:
30-10-2018T10:03:34,iliar,What are you planning to do today? Do you plan to celebrate this holiday?
30-10-2018T10:03:50,iliar,"Maybe my question is a bit strange. It's just that Halloween is not very popular in my country. Therefore, I am not quite sure how people usually do this day."
30-10-2018T10:04:36,Twokinds,It's pretty popular in the US
30-10-2018T10:05:03,Twokinds,"Prooobably the third most popular holiday, behind Christmas and Thanksgiving."
30-10-2018T10:08:11,iliar,Christmas is also popular in my country. But we celebrate it on January 7
30-10-2018T10:36:04,Xexanoth,halloween really only started to get big in the last decade over here in germany.
30-10-2018T10:36:45,Xexanoth,"i'm kinda split about it, on one side it's fund on the other hand, stop ringing on my bloody door."
30-10-2018T10:44:23,Xexanoth,also i just realized we failed as no one suggested a sketch of Red as Little Red Riding Hood and Raine as the Big Bad Wolf
30-10-2018T11:07:10,Mippy,Currently in the studio trying not to ruin my dress. Anyone ever try to pee in a petticoat? It‚Äôs quite the feat. :ctwokinds-clovischuckle:
30-10-2018T11:26:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Want people to avoid your house on Halloween? Put a ‚Äúflu quarantine‚Äù sign out in your yard
30-10-2018T11:43:33,Twokinds,"You know, it's funny, we never get trick or treaters, because we're on a tiny street with only four houses."
30-10-2018T11:43:40,Twokinds,I don't know what I'd do if someone actually showed up.
30-10-2018T11:43:50,Twokinds,I guess I'd have to give them some Korean candy.
30-10-2018T11:44:02,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúChocolate jelly?!‚Äù
30-10-2018T11:44:41,SpazztasticKiwi,We don‚Äôt get trick or treaters either
30-10-2018T11:44:51,SpazztasticKiwi,We live in the country/woods
30-10-2018T11:45:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"If someone pulls into our road, they‚Äôre either lost or in trouble"
30-10-2018T11:56:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Did I sleep for longer than I thought or does my work actually have a Christmas tree outside the front doors on Halloween
30-10-2018T12:07:16,Twokinds,My cat is asleep and it's snoring sounds like an alarm set to vibrate is going off.
30-10-2018T12:07:32,Twokinds,I keep checking my phone thinking I'm getting a ton of messages or something.
30-10-2018T12:15:21,Mippy,Going to the mall to people watch and try to snag some treats. Grownups in costumes deserve treats too! :ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:
30-10-2018T12:27:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"I often pass as someone as young as 12, so I could probably trick or treat if I didn‚Äôt have work"
30-10-2018T12:28:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"And also, I‚Äôd rather be sitting next to kitty on vibrate than be where I am now. Bagheera snores and both cats have Hyper Purr‚Ñ¢Ô∏è"
30-10-2018T12:30:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Well I‚Äôm off to hell. I await for break to return
30-10-2018T12:34:45,Mippy,I get it. I often get mistaken for someone at least a decade younger. I get ID‚Äôd all the time when my friends don‚Äôt. I swear I‚Äôm only a couple months younger than them.
30-10-2018T12:38:37,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake:
30-10-2018T12:41:17,TerraTheWizard,so anyone else here played deltarune?
30-10-2018T12:58:01,Mippy,Can‚Äôt say I have.
30-10-2018T13:27:28,Dadrobit,"""rooobably the third most popular holiday, behind Christmas and Thanksgiving."""
30-10-2018T13:27:57,Dadrobit,"I'm sorry, but excuse me, 4th of July should probably be number one or two."
30-10-2018T13:28:16,Dadrobit,"""Prooobably""*"
30-10-2018T13:28:34,Dadrobit,'Murica and all that.
30-10-2018T13:28:40,Twokinds,I think it largely depends on your family and where you're from.
30-10-2018T13:28:59,Twokinds,And also how young you are.
30-10-2018T13:29:10,Twokinds,But I'd definitely rank thanksgiving over 4th of Joly
30-10-2018T13:30:30,Twokinds,Halloween and 4th of July might be over or under each other.
30-10-2018T13:31:53,Dadrobit,"Huh, interesting. The 4th has always been a major thing so far as my environment was concerned. BBQ, celebrations, and fireworks all day. Thanksgiving was just watching the Macy's Day Parade and dinner with the family."

30-10-2018T16:45:44,Twokinds,Added
30-10-2018T16:45:49,Twokinds,And yeah prob
30-10-2018T16:46:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Welp. Candy corn smile Nibbly will sit for next year
30-10-2018T16:50:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Though today I‚Äôve seen Cruella De Vill and a few Batmans and skull people variations
30-10-2018T16:50:16,SpazztasticKiwi,And a few people in just pajama onsies
30-10-2018T16:52:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,were any pajama onsies T-rex's?

30-10-2018T17:22:49,Twokinds,woah
30-10-2018T17:23:03,Twokinds,It's actually really foggy outside right now. Very appropriate Halloween weather.
30-10-2018T17:31:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,watch out for werewolves and wendigos

30-10-2018T18:47:14,Bgrmystr2,do you like.. live in a crater with no neighbors and noone that comes by?

30-10-2018T18:47:19,Bgrmystr2,do you not get packages?
30-10-2018T18:47:27,Bgrmystr2,not human..?
30-10-2018T18:47:53,Ordithus,"Aargh my arms are a bit weird right now, can barely type"

30-10-2018T18:48:58,Ordithus,Just a sign I'm out of shape
30-10-2018T19:09:08,Dadrobit,"Turn off the porch light, don't answer the door, and wait until tomorrow for all the candy discounts."
30-10-2018T19:12:40,Mippy,I‚Äôve just never lived in a place where the doorbell worked before. People always use to knock.
30-10-2018T19:13:52,Mippy,And when friends visit and stuff we text them and tell them to come straight in. We don‚Äôt know our neighbours.
30-10-2018T19:18:39,SpazztasticKiwi,People don‚Äôt answer the door unless it‚Äôs a certain holiday and I feel that‚Äôs the reason why there were so many serial killers way back
30-10-2018T19:21:09,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs rather...dead at work rn
30-10-2018T19:22:51,Ordithus,Is that unusual
30-10-2018T19:23:27,Bgrmystr2,"Welcome to the world then Mippy, where the rest of us live.. and our doorbells work"

30-10-2018T19:23:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I expected more traffic for the rotisserie chickens tho
30-10-2018T19:30:36,SpazztasticKiwi,A cowboy just ran past the deli
30-10-2018T19:31:55,Ordithus,The beef there is a little past needing to be driven
