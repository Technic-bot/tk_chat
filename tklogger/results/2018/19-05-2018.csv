19-05-2018T00:33:11,SiliconCarbide,how long is the cooldown for suggestions anyway? 1 or 2 weeks?
19-05-2018T00:37:41,unsteddyphoenix,In general if you get one you dont get another chance until the next month.
19-05-2018T00:37:51,SiliconCarbide,ah ok
19-05-2018T00:37:57,unsteddyphoenix,And if yours gets coloured theres a week cooldown
19-05-2018T00:37:57,SiliconCarbide,"goodto know, thanks"
19-05-2018T00:38:06,unsteddyphoenix,:thumbsup:
19-05-2018T01:43:05,Dadrobit,"Eyyyyy, unsteddy, dunno if you're still around, but you said you wanted an update?"
19-05-2018T01:43:12,Dadrobit,I did the thing https://i.imgur.com/71y2XBv.jpg
19-05-2018T01:46:52,unsteddyphoenix,OoOo
19-05-2018T01:47:01,unsteddyphoenix,And thats filled with stuff?
19-05-2018T01:54:13,Dadrobit,"Yeah, There was liquid curry in the middle that also permeated throughout the whole of the meatball."
19-05-2018T01:54:42,Dadrobit,"So when it was cut open, it kind of oozed out into the rest of the broth."
19-05-2018T01:58:00,unsteddyphoenix,Thats like
19-05-2018T01:58:08,unsteddyphoenix,Advanced cookery
19-05-2018T01:58:25,unsteddyphoenix,Im equal parts impressed and hungry
19-05-2018T02:00:06,unsteddyphoenix,"is it like, an actual recipie?"
19-05-2018T02:00:19,Twokinds,nooo I'm so hungry
19-05-2018T02:01:42,Dadrobit,It's real and fake?
19-05-2018T02:02:04,Dadrobit,It's Mapo Curry Tofu Noodles from an anime called Food Wars.
19-05-2018T02:02:34,unsteddyphoenix,Thats a good anime.
19-05-2018T02:02:36,Dadrobit,"And it was indeed advanced cookery, near 2 hours to complete."
19-05-2018T02:02:50,Dadrobit,hopefully faster next time.
19-05-2018T02:03:20,unsteddyphoenix,Hoo~
19-05-2018T02:04:18,unsteddyphoenix,So it was worth the time?
19-05-2018T02:04:35,Dadrobit,It so friggin' was.
19-05-2018T02:05:06,Dadrobit,"Would change a few things next time, but it was still actually amazing."
19-05-2018T02:05:07,BluePhantom90,oh Tom your alive
19-05-2018T02:05:22,unsteddyphoenix,"Damn, sounds nice~"
19-05-2018T02:05:29,unsteddyphoenix,I wonder what else could be made from that show...
19-05-2018T02:05:31,Dadrobit,"Also, I have a ton of curry left over."
19-05-2018T02:05:58,unsteddyphoenix,Leftovers are life
19-05-2018T02:06:58,Dadrobit,I melted the Golden Curry down and cooked it in a broth of cinnamon sticks and ginger with diced fresh jalapenos.
19-05-2018T02:07:28,Dadrobit,Then re-geletanized (that's a word now) it in little paper cups for portioning.
19-05-2018T02:08:22,Dadrobit,"Only used maybe 20% of it in the dish, now I'm just tossing bits of it into everything else and seeing what sticks."
19-05-2018T02:09:11,unsteddyphoenix,So what youre saying is
19-05-2018T02:09:14,unsteddyphoenix,Curry burrito
19-05-2018T02:09:28,Dadrobit,"Holyshit, you're right."
19-05-2018T02:09:40,Dadrobit,"Brb, gonna make a beef curry burrito."
19-05-2018T02:09:50,unsteddyphoenix,that sounds pretty alright actually.
19-05-2018T02:13:28,Dadrobit,"Don't have any ground beef, but I do have a NY cut of steak that I was only going to eat like a normal human being otherwise."
19-05-2018T02:13:31,Dadrobit,So that'll do.
19-05-2018T02:14:22,unsteddyphoenix,Thank god I saved you from that fate.
19-05-2018T02:16:38,NickTheName,Good morning
19-05-2018T02:22:36,Dadrobit,"Alright, meat is marinading."
19-05-2018T02:22:54,Dadrobit,"And thank you, let no one say that I don't take your opinions seriously."
19-05-2018T02:31:49,Twokinds,Be sure to cook the beef well done all the way through to seal in the flavor.
19-05-2018T02:35:54,Dadrobit,"You know, for juuuuust a split second, I thought you were actually providing useful advice."
19-05-2018T02:35:57,unsteddyphoenix,Im already mad
19-05-2018T02:36:46,unsteddyphoenix,To this day I cant tell if Tom actually cooks his steaks well done or if he's sane :thinking:
19-05-2018T03:02:44,Bgrmystr2,takin a break from packin stuff tired as shit :ptv-sad:
19-05-2018T03:26:16,SpazztasticKiwi,What ever possessed you to think Tom was ever sane
19-05-2018T03:28:55,Dadrobit,Holy spicy burrito Batman!
19-05-2018T03:30:45,unsteddyphoenix,That sounds like a cry of resounding success
19-05-2018T03:35:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Or exotic cry for help
19-05-2018T03:38:16,SiliconCarbide,oh man those meatballs look delicious.... its way too early to be looking at food like that
19-05-2018T03:38:42,unsteddyphoenix,yeah I had to go eat after seeing that
19-05-2018T03:38:45,unsteddyphoenix,It was too much

19-05-2018T03:39:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Not safe for diets
19-05-2018T03:39:19,unsteddyphoenix,Better

19-05-2018T03:40:07,SiliconCarbide,x_X
19-05-2018T03:40:31,SpazztasticKiwi,They say if you can’t sleep it’s because someone’s thinking about you. But I’m inclined to believe it’s the sugar
19-05-2018T03:40:47,SiliconCarbide,man i must be on someones mind alot in the evening
19-05-2018T03:42:06,unsteddyphoenix,Famous people would never sleep
19-05-2018T03:42:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Whoever’s got me on their mind at 4 and 5 a.m. needs to take up a new hobby before I hunt them down with a frying pan
19-05-2018T03:42:18,unsteddyphoenix,I heard you sneeze when someones thinking of you
19-05-2018T03:42:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Allergy season means people love you
19-05-2018T03:42:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Poor Tom
19-05-2018T03:43:31,unsteddyphoenix,Just shows how much Holly loves him
19-05-2018T03:43:36,unsteddyphoenix,She makes him sneeze so much~
19-05-2018T03:44:07,SpazztasticKiwi,She’s the real VIP - only one allowed in Tom’s room without knocking
19-05-2018T03:58:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m gonna try going on to bed
19-05-2018T03:58:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll pop back in tomorrow

19-05-2018T04:09:22,Dadrobit,"So, I got God of War. And it may be the greatest game of all time."
19-05-2018T04:09:49,Dadrobit,You can get a summon called Ratatoskr
19-05-2018T04:09:58,Dadrobit,And he is a squirell.
19-05-2018T04:10:09,Dadrobit,Squirrel*
19-05-2018T04:10:44,Dadrobit,A very bitter squirrel that bad mouths you every time you summon him.
19-05-2018T04:11:39,Dadrobit,He just told me to get good and fuck off.
19-05-2018T04:11:46,Dadrobit,GOTY
19-05-2018T04:11:53,unsteddyphoenix,Oh i heard about that lol
19-05-2018T04:13:32,unsteddyphoenix,"Apparently hes like, super useful"
19-05-2018T04:14:53,Dadrobit,He digs up health and rage for you.
19-05-2018T04:14:59,Dadrobit,no damage though.
19-05-2018T04:15:07,unsteddyphoenix,dang PS exclusives
19-05-2018T04:19:36,SiliconCarbide,you know that game almost made me buy a ps4
19-05-2018T04:21:33,SiliconCarbide,then i realized i would be spending 300€ on a videogame and just let it be
19-05-2018T04:29:00,Dadrobit,"Meh, PlayStation is my comfort pick, easy choice for me lol."
19-05-2018T04:29:51,SiliconCarbide,"not picking on it, just not really woth it for me when i only want to play 1 game :&gt;, even though its so tempting.."
19-05-2018T04:34:07,Dadrobit,"I hear ya, but between GoW, The Last of Us, Bloodborne, and Uncharted, it was a darn near mandatory purchase."
19-05-2018T04:36:15,Dadrobit,Also all of my buddies are on PS
19-05-2018T04:37:26,unsteddyphoenix,lol yeah thats the main thing
19-05-2018T04:37:35,unsteddyphoenix,The only reason i'd get a console would be to play with frens
19-05-2018T04:37:50,unsteddyphoenix,Luckily theyre all PC~
19-05-2018T04:38:07,SiliconCarbide,true
19-05-2018T04:38:11,unsteddyphoenix,Sad I cant play Persona though game looks right up my alley
19-05-2018T04:38:34,Dadrobit,"Ah, yeah, that's another I want to pick up."
19-05-2018T04:38:43,Dadrobit,Gotta Plat GoW first though lol.
19-05-2018T04:39:09,unsteddyphoenix,ofc
19-05-2018T04:40:10,unsteddyphoenix,Last of us was great. I borrowed my frens ps3 to play it
19-05-2018T04:41:35,SiliconCarbide,id be more interested in bloodborne
19-05-2018T04:42:11,Dadrobit,Bloodborne is legitimately one of my favorite games of all time.
19-05-2018T04:42:34,SiliconCarbide,oh wow hah
19-05-2018T04:44:33,unsteddyphoenix,I played some of that
19-05-2018T04:45:40,unsteddyphoenix,It was pretty fun
19-05-2018T04:46:31,Dadrobit,"It was my first SoulsBorne game, I was legitimately terrible at it at first."
19-05-2018T04:49:08,unsteddyphoenix,I think I was normal :thinking:
19-05-2018T04:49:18,unsteddyphoenix,I dunno what constitutes for bad or good in that game
19-05-2018T04:49:41,unsteddyphoenix,I got to like...the third boss I think
19-05-2018T04:49:52,unsteddyphoenix,before I fell asleep
19-05-2018T04:50:16,unsteddyphoenix,The aesthetic of that game is :ok_hand:
19-05-2018T04:50:44,Dadrobit,Took me hours just to get past the first street with 20 dudes.
19-05-2018T04:51:28,Dadrobit,"Granted, I was slightly inebriated with my friends at the time, but still."
19-05-2018T04:54:03,unsteddyphoenix,That probably wouldnt help
19-05-2018T04:54:51,Dadrobit,"No, no it did not."
19-05-2018T04:54:59,Dadrobit,Made for a good giggle though.
19-05-2018T04:55:15,Dadrobit,And I did eventually platinum it a bit later.
19-05-2018T04:56:09,unsteddyphoenix,yeah I only played it for a limited time at a friends
19-05-2018T04:56:12,unsteddyphoenix,but waht I did play was great
19-05-2018T10:23:52,PhilTheIdle,"The stream will be in 4.5 hours, wont it?"

19-05-2018T17:38:29,Matth3w23,"Random question again: which stream is usually busier? The Sunday, or Friday one?"
19-05-2018T17:38:35,ItsActuallyKopyKat,You can build up a resistance to bullets by shooting yourself with smaller ones first
19-05-2018T17:38:35,unsteddyphoenix,this one

19-05-2018T17:39:55,ItsActuallyKopyKat,a spider bite is not going to be nearly as much as a snake bite
19-05-2018T17:39:56,BadFoMo,...Free?
19-05-2018T17:40:10,BadFoMo,Eric: ...Yes.

19-05-2018T17:40:32,ThingsAreMoving,"Terra depends, I'm in the UK right now, and if I didn't work afternoons I wouldn't be able to watch the stream."
19-05-2018T17:40:36,ValSalianResident,So are links just straight up not allowed here or what?
19-05-2018T17:40:41,ItsActuallyKopyKat,floof /10
19-05-2018T17:40:42,MallardDuckAvia,I guess size matters.
19-05-2018T17:40:43,DJSlime111,Wait until cameras are invented in the TK universe. Eric's mind will be blown
19-05-2018T17:40:46,GameForge,@itzchannel oh no
19-05-2018T17:40:55,Dadrobit,I was 15. Smart I was not.

19-05-2018T17:41:36,Zakuru,isn't there a site that shortens it for you?
19-05-2018T17:41:37,js199456,Adira is looking Hot!!

19-05-2018T17:41:56,ThingsAreMoving,goo.gl shortens them
19-05-2018T17:41:57,Bgrmystr2,"for 90% of the time, you can get a shorter link"
19-05-2018T17:41:58,Zakuru,"i never do, i just can't remember the name of it"
19-05-2018T17:42:02,ThingsAreMoving,if you need to

19-05-2018T17:42:12,ValSalianResident,Adira is a very aesthetically pleasing character.
19-05-2018T17:42:16,TerraTheWizard,i thought google stopped their URL shortener?
19-05-2018T17:42:17,Bgrmystr2,most ppl use it cuz they're too damn lazy to get the actual link of w/e it is
19-05-2018T17:42:17,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Uhhhh
19-05-2018T17:42:23,Bgrmystr2,instead of putting the google result link

19-05-2018T21:00:37,unsteddyphoenix,Hot cats? Uh-oh
19-05-2018T21:01:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe not hot cats

19-05-2018T21:02:30,Bgrmystr2,I think older ppl like cats cuz they laze about and don't really require you to put forth energy playing with them
19-05-2018T21:02:37,Bgrmystr2,not like dogs do
19-05-2018T21:02:47,Bgrmystr2,neverending energy the things...

19-05-2018T21:03:21,Bgrmystr2,dogs have super energy
19-05-2018T21:03:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Dogs go zooom
19-05-2018T21:03:35,Bgrmystr2,most cats I've seen are pretty laid back

19-05-2018T21:03:56,Bgrmystr2,"they might be playful every once in a while ,sure, but dogs are like that 20/7 I'd say"
19-05-2018T21:04:01,Bgrmystr2,when they're not dead'd asleep
19-05-2018T21:04:12,CrRAR,I think I respect their lifestyles more than anything.
19-05-2018T21:04:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel I’m much like a cat
19-05-2018T21:04:59,unsteddyphoenix,Everybody wants to be a cat~ :musical_note:
19-05-2018T21:05:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause a cats the only cat that knows where it’s at

19-05-2018T21:11:36,unsteddyphoenix,worth it
19-05-2018T21:11:37,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-unimpressed: the only cat expression I ever see.
19-05-2018T21:11:58,Bgrmystr2,all cat expressions are unamusement to some degree of percent
19-05-2018T21:12:01,unsteddyphoenix,Thats just not true bgr
19-05-2018T21:12:06,unsteddyphoenix,Sometimes cats are hungry
19-05-2018T21:12:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera likes to look at me with :ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:
19-05-2018T21:12:23,Bgrmystr2,"even if it's 99% hungry, it's 1% disappointment."
19-05-2018T21:12:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Especially when I have food
19-05-2018T21:12:49,Bgrmystr2,cuz you didn't FEED IT YET &gt;:T
19-05-2018T21:12:59,Bgrmystr2,"if a cat is hungry, you're doing something wronggggggg"
19-05-2018T21:13:01,Bgrmystr2,:v
19-05-2018T21:13:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Then there’s the times when he wants attention
19-05-2018T21:14:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Then he’s like :ctwokinds-natkeith:
19-05-2018T21:14:54,CrRAR,Yes if deprived of cuddles or food they make you well aware. lol
19-05-2018T21:15:19,SpazztasticKiwi,“Pet me. I demand it”
19-05-2018T21:15:33,Vatruvius,My dogs are pretty laid back. We do not play all that much and they just sleep the entire day.
19-05-2018T21:15:41,CrRAR,"""ENOUGH PETS. go away~"""
19-05-2018T21:15:57,CrRAR,mmm
19-05-2018T21:20:48,unsteddyphoenix,Are you sure you dont have cats
19-05-2018T21:20:51,unsteddyphoenix,Have you checked?
19-05-2018T21:21:15,Vatruvius,"I am sure, they are 100% dogs."
19-05-2018T21:21:37,unsteddyphoenix,"This does not coincide with stereotypes, I remain unconvinced"
19-05-2018T21:22:10,Vatruvius,lol
19-05-2018T21:22:29,Vatruvius,My dad is allergic to cat dander so we are a dog family and I rather like that.
19-05-2018T21:23:02,Vatruvius,"I have not had great experiences with cats. I do not have anything against them, I just prefer dogs as a pet."
19-05-2018T21:25:41,unsteddyphoenix,how dare you say such things about cats
19-05-2018T21:25:43,unsteddyphoenix,I am fuming
19-05-2018T21:26:24,Vatruvius,"What, that my dad is allergic and that I prefer dogs personally?"
19-05-2018T21:28:38,SpazztasticKiwi,People who can’t enjoy cats :ctwokinds-LauraCry:
19-05-2018T21:29:10,Vatruvius,For some reason that is not how I feel...
19-05-2018T21:29:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Some people don’t like em i know
19-05-2018T21:30:16,Vatruvius,"I do not hate them or anything, I just am a dog person. It is how I grew up."
19-05-2018T21:30:54,TorqueEmUp,"I enjoy both, they both have their pros and cons"
19-05-2018T21:31:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve had more dogs bite me than cats
19-05-2018T21:33:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Particularly dachshunds. Though it’s because the owner doesn’t know how to train worth anything
19-05-2018T21:33:14,TorqueEmUp,"Cats are easier to take car of, but can be little bastards. Dogs are more needy, and need to be properly trained, but will love you forever."
19-05-2018T21:33:21,TorqueEmUp,care*
19-05-2018T21:33:49,TorqueEmUp,Not saying cats can't love you
19-05-2018T21:34:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Any animal can be a little shit
19-05-2018T21:34:45,SpazztasticKiwi,My moms cat and I don’t always get along
19-05-2018T21:39:03,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah
19-05-2018T21:39:11,unsteddyphoenix,There are cats that are more loyal than dogs\
19-05-2018T21:39:15,unsteddyphoenix,sometimes it be that way
19-05-2018T21:44:41,SpazztasticKiwi,She’s not loyal - just a brat
19-05-2018T21:45:27,SpazztasticKiwi,My mother spoils her pets. One of the many reasons I don’t always get along with her
19-05-2018T21:47:20,unsteddyphoenix,yeah im not a fan of that
19-05-2018T21:47:36,unsteddyphoenix,especially since it normally results in very fat pets
19-05-2018T21:52:12,SpazztasticKiwi,They’re not fat - just don’t know how to act
19-05-2018T21:57:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Well I’m gonna get a snack and YouTube for a bit
19-05-2018T22:13:27,Twokinds,My cat is fat.
19-05-2018T22:15:06,unsteddyphoenix,Shouldve made her diet with you
19-05-2018T22:15:10,unsteddyphoenix,Bonding exercise
19-05-2018T22:18:12,Twokinds,"My diet makes it worse, she gets all the food I don't eat."
19-05-2018T22:20:44,unsteddyphoenix,You mean your cat doesnt exclusively eat one brand of wet cat food
19-05-2018T22:20:49,unsteddyphoenix,And rejects anything else?
19-05-2018T22:20:55,unsteddyphoenix,Doesnt sound like I cat I ever had
19-05-2018T22:21:18,BluePhantom90,lol your cat will be fat Tom if you keep that up
19-05-2018T22:21:27,Twokinds,She is fat.
19-05-2018T22:21:44,unsteddyphoenix,"She may be fat now, but soon she'll be fat"
19-05-2018T22:21:46,BluePhantom90,but fat and fast... I I don't know
19-05-2018T22:23:18,Twokinds,She eats on a scheduled rotation. Dry food -&gt; Paté wet food -&gt; Dry Food -&gt; Shredded wet food -&gt; repeat.
19-05-2018T22:23:48,unsteddyphoenix,Now THAT sounds like a cat :heart_eyes_cat:
19-05-2018T22:24:04,Twokinds,I make sure it's a different flavor each day. Can't repeat.
19-05-2018T22:24:40,unsteddyphoenix,Well I would hope so!
19-05-2018T22:24:51,unsteddyphoenix,The same flavour two days in a row...obscenely cruel!
19-05-2018T22:25:09,BluePhantom90,Well I can see you spoil her Tom
19-05-2018T22:25:38,SpazztasticKiwi,How many meals you give her a day?
19-05-2018T22:25:51,Twokinds,Two
19-05-2018T22:25:58,Twokinds,One in the morning and one at night.
19-05-2018T22:26:06,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s why she fat
19-05-2018T22:26:07,unsteddyphoenix,must be big portions if she got fat off two
19-05-2018T22:26:15,unsteddyphoenix,"Wait, you only give one?"
19-05-2018T22:26:36,unsteddyphoenix,never heard of a cat getting fat off of two meals a day
19-05-2018T22:26:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Is it dry food in the am and the pate at night or dry food for both meals and pate the next day for both meals?
19-05-2018T22:26:57,BluePhantom90,Crap I had something to show how spoiled someone treats their cat
19-05-2018T22:27:24,SpazztasticKiwi,But you treat her good :ctwokinds-katdryer:
19-05-2018T22:27:56,Twokinds,It alternates.
19-05-2018T22:28:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Wet food’s probably what’s packing on the pounds
19-05-2018T22:28:37,SpazztasticKiwi,And lack of exercise
19-05-2018T22:28:39,Twokinds,"Well, she like the wet food."
19-05-2018T22:28:48,BluePhantom90,would have been more funny Tom had a pet squirrel
19-05-2018T22:28:51,Twokinds,I can't help with the excersize problem.
19-05-2018T22:28:59,Twokinds,Though I have been buying the smaller pouches.
19-05-2018T22:29:08,Twokinds,"They're half the size, so perhaps that'll help."
19-05-2018T22:29:09,SpazztasticKiwi,So does my cats. Doesn’t mean they get wet food when they want
19-05-2018T22:29:28,unsteddyphoenix,That'll probably work
19-05-2018T22:29:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Hanging it’s gonna get you a very very affectionate cat
19-05-2018T22:29:36,SpazztasticKiwi,*halfing it
19-05-2018T22:29:45,Twokinds,Yeeeah
19-05-2018T22:29:46,unsteddyphoenix,Hooray~ physical affection~
19-05-2018T22:29:51,Twokinds,That's the biggest problem.
19-05-2018T22:29:59,Twokinds,I use food to get her to go away so I can work.
19-05-2018T22:30:08,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha
19-05-2018T22:30:11,unsteddyphoenix,Shes got you figured out
19-05-2018T22:30:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"“Hooman, my food ran out quicker this morning. Fix it”"
19-05-2018T22:30:31,Twokinds,I should probably feed her the pouches at night.
19-05-2018T22:30:39,Twokinds,She doesn't wake me up once I'm asleep.
19-05-2018T22:30:55,BluePhantom90,how about the cat nip?
19-05-2018T22:30:56,unsteddyphoenix,Thats good
19-05-2018T22:31:10,SpazztasticKiwi,No cat nip. Not good
19-05-2018T22:31:13,unsteddyphoenix,Man shes going to be so lonely when you go to this con...
19-05-2018T22:31:18,Twokinds,She's not very interested in nip.
19-05-2018T22:31:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Ever heard of those work for your food toys?
19-05-2018T22:31:44,Twokinds,Yeeeah. I've tried it.
19-05-2018T22:31:49,Twokinds,She doesn't go for them.
19-05-2018T22:31:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Kiwi goes crazy for them. She gets exercise and the food keeps her attention
19-05-2018T22:32:07,Twokinds,Holly is afraid of most toys.
19-05-2018T22:32:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d say get her a friend but...
19-05-2018T22:32:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Hehe scardycat
19-05-2018T22:32:24,unsteddyphoenix,because the toys come in boxes...
19-05-2018T22:32:34,BluePhantom90,hmm
19-05-2018T22:32:49,Bgrmystr2,hahaha the boxes
19-05-2018T22:32:59,Bgrmystr2,"when you move tom, what are you gonna do"
19-05-2018T22:33:02,Bgrmystr2,not box your stuff up?
19-05-2018T22:33:05,Bgrmystr2,what a nightmareeeeee
19-05-2018T22:33:18,Bgrmystr2,boxes EVERYWHERE
19-05-2018T22:33:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I believe he said before he’s not packing anything
19-05-2018T22:33:29,BluePhantom90,Oh right take your mom will care for your kitty when  your away Tom?
19-05-2018T22:33:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Just gonna up and go
19-05-2018T22:33:36,Bgrmystr2,"wat, how you not gonna pack your computer and stuff"
19-05-2018T22:33:37,Twokinds,I'll box the cat.
19-05-2018T22:33:41,unsteddyphoenix,DONT
19-05-2018T22:33:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom
19-05-2018T22:33:49,Bgrmystr2,THERE IT IS :ptv-laugh:
19-05-2018T22:33:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I hope you mean crate
19-05-2018T22:34:18,unsteddyphoenix,I hope you mean...be nice to and not bully
19-05-2018T22:34:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless you want to risk getting the cops called on you by anyone who spots that
19-05-2018T22:34:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause there’s some nosy people out there
19-05-2018T22:34:43,Twokinds,How would they? She'd be in a box.
19-05-2018T22:34:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Meowing box
19-05-2018T22:34:53,unsteddyphoenix,The air holes would give it away
19-05-2018T22:34:58,Twokinds,Air holes?
19-05-2018T22:35:05,unsteddyphoenix,NnnnnnnnooooOOOOOOOo
19-05-2018T22:35:19,unsteddyphoenix,Im calling peta as we speak
19-05-2018T22:36:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"I have suggested trying to rehome her, but you didn’t seem to like that idea"
19-05-2018T22:36:37,unsteddyphoenix,But theyre so cute together~
19-05-2018T22:36:45,unsteddyphoenix,Toms neglectful impulses aside
19-05-2018T22:37:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Eh I’d take the cat
19-05-2018T22:37:12,BluePhantom90,lol oh god just thought of another funny idea. Flroa and Kat in Keidran kitty crate
19-05-2018T22:37:14,unsteddyphoenix,DO WE SEE 6
19-05-2018T22:37:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Probably better companionship anyway :ptv-condescending:
19-05-2018T22:38:20,BluePhantom90,maybe Eric and Trace taking them to the vet or something joke. Those that own cats know cats hate vets
19-05-2018T22:38:26,Twokinds,Holly would not be happy with other cats around
19-05-2018T22:38:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Moving the cat would probably be the last thing to do after furniture and utilities set up anyway
19-05-2018T22:38:38,Twokinds,She's terrified of every living thing that isn't me shaped.
19-05-2018T22:38:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Even your mom?
19-05-2018T22:38:53,Twokinds,Yeah.
19-05-2018T22:38:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Poor baby
19-05-2018T22:39:14,unsteddyphoenix,Thats so cute~
19-05-2018T22:39:19,BluePhantom90,what about your brother?... Wait he might smell like dog so no
19-05-2018T22:39:20,Twokinds,I think I've given her stockholm syndrome.
19-05-2018T22:39:22,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, its tragic"
19-05-2018T22:39:24,unsteddyphoenix,But also adorable
19-05-2018T22:39:37,SpazztasticKiwi,If I was a cat I’d be afraid of Mark too
19-05-2018T22:39:45,unsteddyphoenix,"You may have put her in the boxes, but you also always freed her from the boxes"
19-05-2018T22:39:45,Twokinds,"Eh... she's sort of okay with Mark, at least when he stays for a while."
19-05-2018T22:39:55,Twokinds,Maybe because he's the most like me.
19-05-2018T22:40:04,SpazztasticKiwi,???
19-05-2018T22:40:20,SpazztasticKiwi,You wanna run that by me again
19-05-2018T22:40:22,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
19-05-2018T22:40:28,Twokinds,Relatively speaking.
19-05-2018T22:40:30,unsteddyphoenix,His AURA is the most similar
19-05-2018T22:40:49,Twokinds,Compared to my mother or her dogs.
19-05-2018T22:41:01,unsteddyphoenix,The dogs are very different from Tom its true
19-05-2018T22:41:26,SpazztasticKiwi,He probably got a lot of his wit and good personality from you but that’s about all I’ve seen of it
19-05-2018T22:41:59,Twokinds,"We both have the same quiet, reserved personality."
19-05-2018T22:42:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll take your word for it
19-05-2018T22:42:28,Twokinds,And sarcasm.
19-05-2018T22:42:39,SpazztasticKiwi,That I definitely believe
19-05-2018T22:42:57,BluePhantom90,should try being less reserve sometime
19-05-2018T22:43:20,unsteddyphoenix,lol
19-05-2018T22:43:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not sure if it’s his energy for creating or what but he’s seemed off to me lately
19-05-2018T22:43:36,Twokinds,Oh great
19-05-2018T22:43:43,Twokinds,Holly sensed I was typing about her
19-05-2018T22:43:47,Twokinds,She's here now. Thanks a lot.
19-05-2018T22:43:50,unsteddyphoenix,Yessssss~
19-05-2018T22:43:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Welcome
19-05-2018T22:43:56,unsteddyphoenix,Touch her face for me
19-05-2018T22:44:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to pet
19-05-2018T22:44:02,BluePhantom90,lol the evil kitty has come
19-05-2018T22:44:04,Bgrmystr2,boop her nose
19-05-2018T22:44:05,Bgrmystr2,:D
19-05-2018T22:44:11,unsteddyphoenix,give her a smoosh
19-05-2018T22:44:20,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
19-05-2018T22:44:27,Bgrmystr2,I don't wanna kill tom
19-05-2018T22:44:30,Bgrmystr2,pls no

19-05-2018T22:44:38,unsteddyphoenix,he'll probably live
19-05-2018T22:44:56,Twokinds,becomes the embodiment of alergies
19-05-2018T22:45:08,SpazztasticKiwi,says suck it up
19-05-2018T22:45:11,Bgrmystr2,wowwwww
19-05-2018T22:45:14,BluePhantom90,"I remember a pic where some guy's cat always laid on his laptop. SO he tried using a decoy laptop, cat laid on both laptops"
19-05-2018T22:45:14,Bgrmystr2,kiwi rooood
19-05-2018T22:45:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m being sarcastic. I know it’s not fun
19-05-2018T22:45:46,BluePhantom90,the kitty out smart the human
19-05-2018T22:45:46,unsteddyphoenix,Love triumphs over sneezes
19-05-2018T22:45:50,unsteddyphoenix,Or something like that
19-05-2018T22:46:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Or kitty is hungry again
19-05-2018T22:46:34,Twokinds,"She can't be hungry, she's got food."
19-05-2018T22:46:43,SpazztasticKiwi,You underestimate cats
19-05-2018T22:46:59,Twokinds,"She's just shedding right now, and lazy."
19-05-2018T22:47:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"If there’s a spot in the bowl where you can see the bottom, it’s empty"
19-05-2018T22:47:10,Twokinds,She wants to be brushed.
19-05-2018T22:47:20,unsteddyphoenix,Aww~
19-05-2018T22:47:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Brushie brushie
19-05-2018T22:47:31,unsteddyphoenix,That way the fur will get EVERYWHERE :D
19-05-2018T22:47:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Sneezie deathy
19-05-2018T22:47:57,zolstarym,I am lucky I am not allergic. My cat has the thinnest fine hairs that get lodged in my nose.
19-05-2018T22:48:12,zolstarym,I find them if I use qtips
19-05-2018T22:48:12,unsteddyphoenix,jesus
19-05-2018T22:48:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera sheds all over my bed
19-05-2018T22:48:32,SpazztasticKiwi,My pillow seems perpetually covered
19-05-2018T22:48:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"And even though I hang up my clothes, there’s cat hair"
19-05-2018T22:49:11,unsteddyphoenix,Been there.
19-05-2018T22:49:12,Twokinds,"I actually bought a huuuge set of pillow cases on Amazon, so I can replace them daily."
19-05-2018T22:49:19,Twokinds,Helps with allergies.
19-05-2018T22:49:29,unsteddyphoenix,huge pillow cases? What character did you get on them?
19-05-2018T22:49:39,Twokinds,...
19-05-2018T22:49:40,SpazztasticKiwi,She doesn’t sleep on the bed does she
19-05-2018T22:49:54,unsteddyphoenix,I'll be here all week
19-05-2018T22:50:01,Twokinds,"No, but that doesn't stop the dander from getting everywhere."
19-05-2018T22:50:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Ah yes. Tom has an anime body pillow. Thanks for that mental image
19-05-2018T22:50:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m gonna play with kittens to purge my brain
19-05-2018T22:50:59,unsteddyphoenix,"Jokes aside it must be like, extremely difficult."
19-05-2018T22:51:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Probably gonna celebrate when you go to MomoCon
19-05-2018T22:51:26,unsteddyphoenix,He'll be freeeee~
19-05-2018T22:51:28,SpazztasticKiwi,“I can breathe”
19-05-2018T22:51:47,Twokinds,Yeah I always sleep well at conventions.
19-05-2018T22:52:03,unsteddyphoenix,While Holly is in a constant state of panic since Toms not there
19-05-2018T22:52:08,unsteddyphoenix,:(
19-05-2018T22:52:13,Twokinds,Indeed
19-05-2018T22:52:27,unsteddyphoenix,So thats a win-win for you?
19-05-2018T22:52:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Poor kitty
19-05-2018T22:52:34,unsteddyphoenix,:upside_down:
19-05-2018T22:53:04,Twokinds,I do leave her like 6 bowls of food and water.
19-05-2018T22:53:24,unsteddyphoenix,Uh.
19-05-2018T22:53:32,SpazztasticKiwi,But that doesn’t make up for the companionship that I’m sure you excell in
19-05-2018T22:53:33,unsteddyphoenix,Wouldnt...your mother feed her
19-05-2018T22:53:37,BluePhantom90,So will you be gone for 5 or 6 days?
19-05-2018T22:53:45,unsteddyphoenix,6 bowls is 3 days
19-05-2018T22:53:46,Twokinds,I'm not sure.
19-05-2018T22:54:05,Twokinds,"She's fat, she can live off her reserves."
19-05-2018T22:54:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Harsh but tru
19-05-2018T22:54:27,unsteddyphoenix,I mean...
19-05-2018T22:54:55,unsteddyphoenix,If only you could set them into hibernation mode
19-05-2018T22:55:07,SpazztasticKiwi,This oddly reminds me my sister wants to go to the movies and see that new Jurassic
19-05-2018T22:55:09,BluePhantom90,I swear the comic con is like 4 days. So you might be gone for like 5 or 6 days unless you wantd to make it home early Sunday or on monday
19-05-2018T22:57:08,Twokinds,I'm not sure what I'll do when I go to Korea
19-05-2018T22:57:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Look around
19-05-2018T22:57:19,Twokinds,It'll be the longest I've ever been away.
19-05-2018T22:57:35,Twokinds,I might need to buy an auto-feeder.
19-05-2018T22:57:36,unsteddyphoenix,You'll come back and she'll be skinny and sad
19-05-2018T22:57:45,unsteddyphoenix,Like a giant version of those birdfeeders?
19-05-2018T22:57:50,zolstarym,north or south?
19-05-2018T22:57:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Guess
19-05-2018T22:58:08,zolstarym,If you go to north then you will also return skinny. To match your cat
19-05-2018T22:58:27,unsteddyphoenix,mk
19-05-2018T22:58:53,unsteddyphoenix,You gonna do those sketch commissions at the con Tom?
19-05-2018T22:58:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"It’ll either be auto feeder, pet sitter or board her"
19-05-2018T22:59:02,unsteddyphoenix,Ooo cat hotel! :D
19-05-2018T22:59:12,unsteddyphoenix,but like...private room
19-05-2018T22:59:15,unsteddyphoenix,I dunno if thats a thign
19-05-2018T22:59:22,Twokinds,At... this con this week?
19-05-2018T22:59:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"She’d flip, but if it’s all you can do..."
19-05-2018T22:59:29,unsteddyphoenix,yeah
19-05-2018T22:59:39,Twokinds,No. I'm not working at the con.
19-05-2018T22:59:43,unsteddyphoenix,"I mean, I guess if youre going as a guest"
19-05-2018T22:59:56,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, good point. Dumb question"
19-05-2018T23:01:39,unsteddyphoenix,Huh. Autofeeders arent that pricy.
19-05-2018T23:01:53,unsteddyphoenix,As long as someone gives her water...
19-05-2018T23:01:57,SpazztasticKiwi,July gives you a good bit of time to plan
19-05-2018T23:01:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Kinda
19-05-2018T23:03:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless you want to put it off for another year and get it arranged a little better
19-05-2018T23:05:33,unsteddyphoenix,but if he's moved out by next year then he'd need a petsitter
19-05-2018T23:05:43,Twokinds,"Okay, I got a gravity feeder and waterer."
19-05-2018T23:05:57,Vatruvius,What is this about moving out?
19-05-2018T23:06:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Well that was quick
19-05-2018T23:06:21,unsteddyphoenix,waterer?
19-05-2018T23:06:31,unsteddyphoenix,I guess that would be a thing
19-05-2018T23:06:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Keeps the water fresh and ready
19-05-2018T23:06:55,SpazztasticKiwi,We have a really big one for our indoor pets
19-05-2018T23:07:14,unsteddyphoenix,oo cool
19-05-2018T23:09:38,Bgrmystr2,"lol, tom thinkin about moving, Vatru"
19-05-2018T23:10:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Have you even found a house you like yet
19-05-2018T23:10:15,Twokinds,Yes.
19-05-2018T23:10:25,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s a start
19-05-2018T23:10:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Is there a “but”?
19-05-2018T23:10:43,Twokinds,Found a really cool house with a super awesome two tiered deck facing the woods.
19-05-2018T23:11:06,Twokinds,But it's about 75000 more than I want to spend.
19-05-2018T23:11:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Ouch
19-05-2018T23:11:17,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh
19-05-2018T23:11:37,unsteddyphoenix,Time to HAGGLE
19-05-2018T23:11:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Or try to
19-05-2018T23:12:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Getting someone to go down 75000 isn’t easy
19-05-2018T23:12:24,Bgrmystr2,well.. when a house costs like.. 4 million or somethin
19-05-2018T23:12:31,Bgrmystr2,75k ain't much
19-05-2018T23:12:37,Bgrmystr2,so I mean.. there ARE instances..
19-05-2018T23:12:45,unsteddyphoenix,"it's not but, if noone buys it for a while..."
19-05-2018T23:12:54,Bgrmystr2,just probably not for tom's specific scenario
19-05-2018T23:12:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’d like my cousin’s old house but someone bought it, changed it up, and is now reselling it"
19-05-2018T23:13:11,unsteddyphoenix,"best to keep an eye on it, which I assume what Tom was doing anyway"
19-05-2018T23:13:34,SpazztasticKiwi,The changes are nice but they put this really pale outside color on it
19-05-2018T23:14:07,unsteddyphoenix,"If you pay more than you want to for it Tom, i'll sub again. That should cover it."
19-05-2018T23:14:29,SpazztasticKiwi,And now it doesn’t sit in its little wooded area as cozy - it sticks out
19-05-2018T23:14:46,Twokinds,I actually am wondering if there's something wrong with the house.
19-05-2018T23:15:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Have you not done a walk through?
19-05-2018T23:15:19,Twokinds,"Because it looks so nice in photos, and it seems like a normal price for the neighborhood, but it hasn't sold in months."
19-05-2018T23:15:30,Twokinds,"Nah, I haven't looked at any houses in person yet."
19-05-2018T23:15:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe someone passed away in it
19-05-2018T23:15:47,Bgrmystr2,"tom, what you can do is request an appraisal and inspection"
19-05-2018T23:15:49,SpazztasticKiwi,That usually scares off buyers
19-05-2018T23:15:54,Bgrmystr2,that would tell you if the house has any problems
19-05-2018T23:15:58,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe it's far away from things normal people care about? :thinking:
19-05-2018T23:15:58,Bgrmystr2,they're not too expensive
19-05-2018T23:16:10,Bgrmystr2,around here they're about $400 for aech
19-05-2018T23:16:12,Bgrmystr2,each* even
19-05-2018T23:16:33,SpazztasticKiwi,But checking records and getting someone to look it over may pay off better
19-05-2018T23:16:46,Twokinds,"Yeah, I guess"
19-05-2018T23:17:13,Twokinds,Right now I'm just trying to save as much money as possible so I'm in the best position when I do decide to talk to a broker and see how much I can afford.
19-05-2018T23:17:32,SpazztasticKiwi,You do you
19-05-2018T23:17:34,Bgrmystr2,"I'm literally packing right now, and will be packing all this week while you guys are at the con, and we paid for an inspection and appraisal. ended up the guy wanted too much for the house."
19-05-2018T23:17:53,Bgrmystr2,and he had a bunch of stuff that was illegal cuz unsafe
19-05-2018T23:18:02,Vatruvius,Where are you planing on moving to Tom? State/Country
19-05-2018T23:18:03,unsteddyphoenix,oh damn
19-05-2018T23:18:04,Vatruvius,?
19-05-2018T23:18:14,Twokinds,Cincinnati OH
19-05-2018T23:18:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Being picky is better than being a push over
19-05-2018T23:18:33,Vatruvius,"Ah, not much of a difference right..."
19-05-2018T23:18:39,Twokinds,Yeah
19-05-2018T23:18:39,Vatruvius,Or am I remembering wrong?
19-05-2018T23:18:45,Vatruvius,okay
19-05-2018T23:19:31,Vatruvius,"Getting that nice woods view, I love mine."
19-05-2018T23:19:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Staying around home cause you like it or cause it’s too much to move states
19-05-2018T23:19:43,Twokinds,Ideally.
19-05-2018T23:19:45,Vatruvius,"Actually, I have a view over several valleys."
19-05-2018T23:20:11,Twokinds,I don't see any reason to move anywhere else.
19-05-2018T23:20:24,SpazztasticKiwi,We’re in the woods too. Alot of people come up to hunt
19-05-2018T23:20:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Sometimes without permission
19-05-2018T23:20:45,Vatruvius,Yeah that is not good.
19-05-2018T23:21:06,Twokinds,"Speaking of money, just got a message from my investment firm. Dividend gained!"
19-05-2018T23:21:13,Twokinds,$0.03!
19-05-2018T23:21:14,Vatruvius,"Hunting does not really happen around me, homes are spread out everywhere so you would always be in someone's property."
19-05-2018T23:21:22,Vatruvius,Nice!
19-05-2018T23:21:25,Twokinds,I'm rolling in it now.
19-05-2018T23:21:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Or you will be in 30 years
19-05-2018T23:21:39,Vatruvius,"Don't spend it all at once Tom, think to the future."
19-05-2018T23:21:42,Vatruvius,:ptv-tease:
19-05-2018T23:21:51,unsteddyphoenix,Now you gotta turn around and invest THAT
19-05-2018T23:21:57,unsteddyphoenix,Buy gold
19-05-2018T23:22:17,SpazztasticKiwi,We once came across a pair of ladies undies and a camera on our property
19-05-2018T23:22:30,Vatruvius,Uh...
19-05-2018T23:22:41,Vatruvius,Anything interesting on the camera?
19-05-2018T23:22:41,SpazztasticKiwi,We didn’t look at the film
19-05-2018T23:22:46,Vatruvius,I see.
19-05-2018T23:22:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Didn’t want to know
19-05-2018T23:22:53,unsteddyphoenix,How could you resisit
19-05-2018T23:22:53,Vatruvius,lol
19-05-2018T23:23:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t have a desire to see some random stranger’s bits
19-05-2018T23:23:20,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s how
19-05-2018T23:23:39,unsteddyphoenix,Sure you know what was PROBABLY on it...but still...
19-05-2018T23:23:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Still gonna pass
19-05-2018T23:23:59,unsteddyphoenix,What if they buried treasure there and left those as markers!
19-05-2018T23:24:17,SpazztasticKiwi,We’ve also found alot of beer cans and bottles
19-05-2018T23:24:26,unsteddyphoenix,thats less fun
19-05-2018T23:24:46,Vatruvius,"Yeah, I wouldn't actually look at it either. Perhaps some of those hunter night cameras though, see who the hell is on my property. Maybe release it on social media...not sure. Depends on the content."
19-05-2018T23:31:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I prefer to find my adventures elsewhere
19-05-2018T23:31:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Like the movies in Tupelo
19-05-2018T23:31:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Or Mule Day in September
19-05-2018T23:32:08,Vatruvius,I do not do anything on social media. Last time I was on any social media platform must have been over a month ago and even then it was to get Facebook to shut up and stop sending be notifications.
19-05-2018T23:32:25,Vatruvius,me*
19-05-2018T23:33:15,Twokinds,Same here.
19-05-2018T23:33:52,unsteddyphoenix,Eh its useful for organising events and chatting
19-05-2018T23:34:13,unsteddyphoenix,WHen I was in uni facebook was basically required
19-05-2018T23:34:22,Twokinds,Eugh
19-05-2018T23:34:28,Twokinds,"Socializing? Like, in real life?"
19-05-2018T23:34:34,Twokinds,Weirdo.
19-05-2018T23:34:48,unsteddyphoenix,Harsh but fair
19-05-2018T23:35:00,Vatruvius,"Nah, this beats real life socializing."
19-05-2018T23:35:02,Twokinds,(is literally going to a con with friends in three days)
19-05-2018T23:35:14,Vatruvius,I can look at drawings of furrys without scrutiny.
19-05-2018T23:35:26,unsteddyphoenix,Haha
19-05-2018T23:35:37,Vatruvius,:ptv-laugh:
19-05-2018T23:35:48,unsteddyphoenix,"Cons are like, maximum socialising"
19-05-2018T23:35:50,unsteddyphoenix,Good luck
19-05-2018T23:36:45,Vatruvius,I like the occasional real life socializing but that is in short supply where I am.
19-05-2018T23:36:53,Vatruvius,Far easier just to hop online.
19-05-2018T23:36:54,unsteddyphoenix,What actually is there to do at momocon
19-05-2018T23:37:01,unsteddyphoenix,"Is it all like, anime?"
19-05-2018T23:37:22,Twokinds,It's just body pillows.
19-05-2018T23:37:27,Twokinds,Nothing but body pillows.
19-05-2018T23:37:36,Twokinds,It's an anime themed Bed bath and beyond
19-05-2018T23:37:42,Vatruvius,Twokinds body pillows?
19-05-2018T23:37:46,Vatruvius,:thinking:
19-05-2018T23:37:56,Vatruvius,lol
19-05-2018T23:38:15,unsteddyphoenix,Jesus
19-05-2018T23:38:21,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds amazing
19-05-2018T23:38:39,unsteddyphoenix,I look forward to seeing your post con collection
19-05-2018T23:38:47,SpazztasticKiwi,An anime Bed Bath and Beyond you say?
19-05-2018T23:38:50,Vatruvius,"Like, I can understand enjoying being online but when your online life, like anime for instance, takes up space on your bed with a body pillow of your waifu...you need to step into the sun a little bit."
19-05-2018T23:39:11,SpazztasticKiwi,You’re gonna leave feeling like you soaked in perfume for a week
19-05-2018T23:39:18,Twokinds,"Hey, I'm totally okay if people want to spend money on stuff like that"
19-05-2018T23:39:30,SpazztasticKiwi,If the socializing doesn’t kill you
19-05-2018T23:39:42,Vatruvius,lol...I say that even though if a Kat body pillow came out...
19-05-2018T23:40:10,unsteddyphoenix,...
19-05-2018T23:40:13,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s only weird when you start treating it like a person or partner
19-05-2018T23:40:15,Bgrmystr2,I'd LOVE to go :/
19-05-2018T23:40:33,Vatruvius,"Agreed Kiwi, that is what I was talking about."
19-05-2018T23:40:34,Twokinds,"I should sell one. But I'll play it off like a joke, so people feel okay about buying it, cause it's just a joke. Not REALLY buying a body pillow haha"
19-05-2018T23:40:46,unsteddyphoenix,Haha i'll take 3 haha
19-05-2018T23:40:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Totally not after the :ctwokinds-KatDance:
19-05-2018T23:41:00,Vatruvius,"I will settle for one, helps with the way I sleep."
19-05-2018T23:41:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"“It’s for my back, I swear”"
19-05-2018T23:41:21,unsteddyphoenix,With 3 you get every Kat combination
19-05-2018T23:41:26,Twokinds,I should do one with Flora's face in this: :ctwokinds-FloDance:
19-05-2018T23:41:34,unsteddyphoenix,I have actually hard you can use it for back support
19-05-2018T23:41:38,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
19-05-2018T23:41:47,unsteddyphoenix,Ideally with her eyes derping
19-05-2018T23:41:47,Vatruvius,"I have 4 pillows I need, technically 3 but I have 4 for symmetry."
19-05-2018T23:41:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Flora pillow would be too flat
19-05-2018T23:41:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I had to
19-05-2018T23:42:00,unsteddyphoenix,Ouch
19-05-2018T23:42:37,Vatruvius,No...Kiwi...you monster!
19-05-2018T23:43:07,Vatruvius,Just for that Flora will get a special pillow to help bring in the 3D aspect. All the other won't.
19-05-2018T23:43:17,Vatruvius,others*
19-05-2018T23:43:17,Twokinds,Just gotta sell the Natani bindings body pillow add-on
19-05-2018T23:43:26,Vatruvius,lol
19-05-2018T23:43:28,Vatruvius,Top seller.
19-05-2018T23:43:30,Vatruvius,All time.
19-05-2018T23:43:32,unsteddyphoenix,Now youre thinkin'
19-05-2018T23:43:41,SpazztasticKiwi,You’d give the equivalent of a push up bra for a Flora body pillow
19-05-2018T23:44:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Nice to know we have our priorities in order
19-05-2018T23:44:08,Vatruvius,lol
19-05-2018T23:44:45,unsteddyphoenix,then the other side would be her crazy face from the sketch
19-05-2018T23:44:47,unsteddyphoenix,Perfect
19-05-2018T23:45:27,Bgrmystr2,"If you sell a flora body pillow making an angry derp face, I will fucking buy one tom"
19-05-2018T23:45:32,Bgrmystr2,I guarantee it
19-05-2018T23:45:40,Bgrmystr2,xD
19-05-2018T23:45:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I probably would too
19-05-2018T23:46:03,Vatruvius,I will settle with just a Twokinds pillow case of Kat. I get that that is what body pillows pretty much are but then I would just in the case and not the pillow. Just switch out my current pillow case.
19-05-2018T23:46:29,Bgrmystr2,yes phoenix xD
19-05-2018T23:47:00,Vatruvius,Should come with functional claws...
19-05-2018T23:48:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Or you could go out and get a girlfriend. Not as hard as you think
19-05-2018T23:48:12,Twokinds,"Well, I already have a kat pillow design ready to go"
19-05-2018T23:48:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Oooo
19-05-2018T23:48:33,Twokinds,ala unsteddy
19-05-2018T23:48:48,Twokinds,Just need to find someone to make a three sided pillow and case
19-05-2018T23:49:00,unsteddyphoenix,"Orrrr, just get 3 pillows~"
19-05-2018T23:49:09,unsteddyphoenix,and have every combination
19-05-2018T23:49:54,Vatruvius,They could be just regular two sided pillows?
19-05-2018T23:50:04,unsteddyphoenix,I think I remember seeing that there actually were 3 sided pillows
19-05-2018T23:50:40,Vatruvius,How would a 3 sided pillow be functional besides a decoration piece on the bed or whatever?
19-05-2018T23:50:43,SpazztasticKiwi,:ctwokinds-KatDance::ctwokinds-FloDance:
19-05-2018T23:51:05,unsteddyphoenix,"Idk. I looked it up at the time, just remember it existing"
19-05-2018T23:52:57,Vatruvius,I hug my pillows at night so I fail to see how a three sided pillow could fill that role for me.
19-05-2018T23:54:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I sleep with a pillow at my feet under my head and on my right
19-05-2018T23:54:36,unsteddyphoenix,"tbh it'd probably end up like, hidden away in my closet or something."
19-05-2018T23:54:45,unsteddyphoenix,But...I still kinda want to have it.
19-05-2018T23:54:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Two of them are Bagheera’s but he likes to sleep on my hip
19-05-2018T23:55:45,Vatruvius,"I would actually use it, think it would be cool. But it would probably be in my closet during the day until I get a place of my own. Parents would think I was psychotic."
19-05-2018T23:55:58,Bgrmystr2,"I looked it up, but it's like.. a normal pillow but has 3 of em attached to each other.."
19-05-2018T23:56:06,Bgrmystr2,so there's 3 pillows with 2 sides..
19-05-2018T23:56:11,Bgrmystr2,not an actual 3 sided pillow
19-05-2018T23:56:20,Bgrmystr2,:/
19-05-2018T23:56:24,unsteddyphoenix,eh. sounds fine
19-05-2018T23:56:40,Bgrmystr2,how hard is it to get a 3d triangle pillow
19-05-2018T23:56:45,Vatruvius,"I see, so like three pillow cases sewed together on the sides?"
19-05-2018T23:56:46,Bgrmystr2,I dunno what the shape is called
19-05-2018T23:56:57,unsteddyphoenix,Easier than getting a girlfriend :upside_down:
19-05-2018T23:57:10,Vatruvius,A trough shaped pillow?
19-05-2018T23:57:37,Vatruvius,"Alright, just downloaded this game and going to play it. I will check in here and there."
