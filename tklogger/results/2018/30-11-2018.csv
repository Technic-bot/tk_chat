30-11-2018T00:08:11,LOGANWOLF,Why is Rose the prettiest vampire?! :ptv-excited:
30-11-2018T00:08:25,Mihari,Cause she's white as a ghost by default?
30-11-2018T00:08:35,Ordithus,Because she is always pretty
30-11-2018T00:08:38,Twokinds,Because white goes well with bl... yeah
30-11-2018T00:08:42,Bgrmystr2,"I'd debate that, Logan. She does look rather ravashing though."
30-11-2018T00:09:08,EggRollss,That is very true
30-11-2018T00:09:44,Mihari,"Course that makes me wonder how fast a supernatural cheetah would be if they were a vampire, that speed and strength boost that goes hand and hand with them... XD"
30-11-2018T00:10:12,LOGANWOLF,Oof that's true
30-11-2018T00:10:32,Twokinds,"Speed value exceeds 255, wraps back around to 0"
30-11-2018T00:11:04,Bgrmystr2,slowest cheetah ever.
30-11-2018T00:11:12,Bgrmystr2,but can teleport.
30-11-2018T00:11:17,Bgrmystr2,who needs to walk
30-11-2018T00:11:30,Twokinds,Why walk when you can ride?
30-11-2018T00:11:41,LOGANWOLF,Who needs to walk when you have instant transmission 👀
30-11-2018T00:11:53,Dadrobit,"Ohhhhhh, Morrowind references, I can get behind that."
30-11-2018T00:12:19,EggRollss,Imagine if you could just teleport every were
30-11-2018T00:12:40,LOGANWOLF,That'd be cool
30-11-2018T00:12:57,LOGANWOLF,I'd go to japan first though
30-11-2018T00:13:11,Twokinds,I had a dream the other day where people could just use their cellphones to jump from place to place.
30-11-2018T00:13:26,Twokinds,"It was completely normal to me and I was just like ""Why don't I use this more often?"""
30-11-2018T00:13:51,unsteddyphoenix,Eh it'd still mean leaving my house
30-11-2018T00:13:52,Dadrobit,Because you can use your phone already to make other people teleport to you.
30-11-2018T00:13:52,unsteddyphoenix,Pass
30-11-2018T00:14:00,Ordithus,"In a world of teleporting, do people dream of walking? :ctwokinds-floraquestion:"

30-11-2018T00:14:42,EggRollss,But your not there in person
30-11-2018T00:14:48,Bgrmystr2,sure you are
30-11-2018T00:14:51,Dadrobit,"Why teleport elsewhere, when you can just have everyone else bring everything else to you."
30-11-2018T00:15:00,Bgrmystr2,"you're sitting in front of your phone right, egg?"
30-11-2018T00:15:13,LOGANWOLF,"It's like ""I'll use google earth to go wherever i want"" And ill find it very convinient"

30-11-2018T00:16:15,LOGANWOLF,That guy is serving a Smash Ball from super smash bros
30-11-2018T00:17:19,Dadrobit,"You can kinda sorta already do that, just go to a Korean restaurant."
30-11-2018T00:17:40,Twokinds,I would leave me house a lot more if I could just open a gateway from place to place.
30-11-2018T00:17:42,Dadrobit,Went to a Chinese/Mexican restaurant the other day.
30-11-2018T00:17:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lucky

30-11-2018T00:25:00,Ordithus,Been a while... forests and caves for so long
30-11-2018T00:25:23,Destro35,That is the kind of world we live in no arcades
30-11-2018T00:25:51,Destro35,My brother would love to see this
30-11-2018T00:26:25,Destro35,The music is good aswell
30-11-2018T00:26:33,LOGANWOLF,I miss the arcades we used to have but most of them are left to rot or sold for parts
30-11-2018T00:26:58,Destro35,Now they are in the backs of pizza places
30-11-2018T00:27:09,SageSaga,darn didnt work XD
30-11-2018T00:27:12,LOGANWOLF,Which ones though?
30-11-2018T00:28:31,Destro35,Shakey's pizza has small arcades and I don't mean like huge ones but a real big one would be at Camelot
30-11-2018T00:28:35,Ordithus,Eh?  What didn't work?
30-11-2018T00:28:47,LOGANWOLF,Aah
30-11-2018T00:29:03,LOGANWOLF,I dont have that pizza place where i live 😅
30-11-2018T00:29:30,LOGANWOLF,But if there was an arcade in a pizza place then im down
30-11-2018T00:29:57,Destro35,Oh well that could be a little bit of the problem
30-11-2018T00:30:12,SageSaga,i tried the colorize option on the buildings
30-11-2018T00:30:22,Ordithus,Ah.
30-11-2018T00:30:32,Twokinds,lol
30-11-2018T00:30:34,LOGANWOLF,Why though?
30-11-2018T00:30:46,Destro35,I feel bad for the restaurant

30-11-2018T00:31:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,See ya Egggg
30-11-2018T00:32:03,Destro35,That would be a little hard
30-11-2018T00:32:22,LOGANWOLF,Lol true
30-11-2018T00:32:51,Bgrmystr2,I don't think so
30-11-2018T00:32:59,Bgrmystr2,considering I don't think the dragons in tom's world even need to eat
30-11-2018T00:33:15,Ordithus,"Reni does drink a ton of coffee, though"
30-11-2018T00:33:19,LOGANWOLF,How's that?
30-11-2018T00:33:28,Bgrmystr2,they're beings of magic
30-11-2018T00:33:31,LOGANWOLF,She's a morning fan.
30-11-2018T00:33:32,Bgrmystr2,not flesh and blood

30-11-2018T00:33:52,Bgrmystr2,"so it's very likely that they eat for fun, rather than for sustinance."
30-11-2018T00:34:09,Destro35,Yeah they use magic so i think of it as they can eat but they tend not to since they have magic to keep them going
30-11-2018T00:34:46,LOGANWOLF,I call that life hacks
30-11-2018T00:35:27,Destro35,Well they are not invincible but are hard to kill
30-11-2018T00:35:32,Bgrmystr2,"humans can use magic, but dragons *are* magic"
30-11-2018T00:35:48,Bgrmystr2,I think that's really the difference.
30-11-2018T00:36:23,SageSaga,so humans can use dragons?
30-11-2018T00:36:38,Bgrmystr2,yyyyyyyyyyyes.......? :ptv-wondering:
30-11-2018T00:36:43,Destro35,In away i guess

30-11-2018T00:37:54,Bgrmystr2,boiling red hot just like greatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgrandma Nora used to make.
30-11-2018T00:38:19,Bgrmystr2,probably further than that.
30-11-2018T00:38:24,LOGANWOLF,Lol that's accurate
30-11-2018T00:38:29,Destro35,Well i like to think as the dragon stone can hold a dangerous dragon inside it
30-11-2018T00:38:41,Destro35,It makes sense
30-11-2018T00:38:58,LOGANWOLF,That nervous face though :ptv-excited:
30-11-2018T00:40:30,Destro35,Well i guess she will not pay the tip or leave a very big one
30-11-2018T00:41:10,LOGANWOLF,"Why does she need to, she's a dragon."
30-11-2018T00:41:46,Destro35,Her presence is the only tip humans are allowed to have
30-11-2018T00:42:07,LOGANWOLF,Oooh i like that color effect on the wing. Looks pretty
30-11-2018T00:42:45,Destro35,Nice

30-11-2018T01:12:14,Vatruvius,Well...at least it is a break of some sort.
30-11-2018T01:12:34,Vatruvius,"Where are you going for school? High school, college?"
30-11-2018T01:13:29,Destro35,But good luck to everyone's webcomics i hope all of them are successful and thank you for making them so people can go to other worlds

30-11-2018T01:18:17,Destro35,Yep

30-11-2018T01:18:34,Vatruvius,Drats...was worth the try.
30-11-2018T01:18:52,Vatruvius,You will quickly find other comics that interest you Des.
30-11-2018T01:19:02,Bgrmystr2,Sage's comics might interest you :V
30-11-2018T01:19:07,Bgrmystr2,you should read them too
30-11-2018T01:19:17,Vatruvius,^
30-11-2018T01:19:23,Destro35,Words sailing over my head but i will check them out
30-11-2018T01:19:23,Vatruvius,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
30-11-2018T01:19:52,Destro35,Also you all sound like you are being paid to say that
30-11-2018T01:19:59,Bgrmystr2,I wish
30-11-2018T01:20:02,Bgrmystr2,I'd have money then
30-11-2018T01:20:06,Destro35,Hahaha
30-11-2018T01:20:10,Bgrmystr2,but I don't
30-11-2018T01:20:13,Vatruvius,Umm...does donating money to you Sage count as you paying me?
30-11-2018T01:20:36,Destro35,Eh
30-11-2018T01:20:42,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, if sage had money to pay us to advertise for him, then it'd be because we'd be on his patreon supporting him in the  first place"
30-11-2018T01:20:50,Bgrmystr2,which.. I don't have the money for in the first place.
30-11-2018T01:20:52,Bgrmystr2,so..
30-11-2018T01:21:01,Bgrmystr2,viscious circle.
30-11-2018T01:21:02,Vatruvius,You poor man Bgr...
30-11-2018T01:21:06,Bgrmystr2,haha

30-11-2018T01:21:17,Bgrmystr2,not poor sage or anyone else
30-11-2018T01:21:19,Destro35,Anyway what are some of his comics you recommend
30-11-2018T01:21:19,Bgrmystr2,xD
30-11-2018T01:21:34,Vatruvius,"Well, I mean that as you are a poor man...not poor you."
30-11-2018T01:21:50,Vatruvius,"Yosh!, Artificial Incident"
30-11-2018T01:21:50,Bgrmystr2,"well, I haven't read Yosh yet, but I want to, and Artificial Incident I can say is pretty good."
30-11-2018T01:21:55,Vatruvius,Very good reads.
30-11-2018T01:22:07,Vatruvius,You have not read Yosh! Bgr?
30-11-2018T01:22:13,Vatruvius,How?
30-11-2018T01:22:13,Bgrmystr2,not yet
30-11-2018T01:22:15,Bgrmystr2,cuz
30-11-2018T01:22:18,SageSaga,Artificial Incident isnt just pretty good- it's pretty great
30-11-2018T01:22:20,SageSaga,:P
30-11-2018T01:22:22,Vatruvius,"You better start, it is a long read."
30-11-2018T01:22:31,Bgrmystr2,why do you think I haven't started yet
30-11-2018T01:22:37,Bgrmystr2,I've been keeping up with it since........
30-11-2018T01:22:37,Vatruvius,It's got my recommendation...
30-11-2018T01:22:41,Bgrmystr2,hmm
30-11-2018T01:22:43,Vatruvius,:ctwokinds-wink:
30-11-2018T01:22:49,Bgrmystr2,a little bit ago honestly
30-11-2018T01:22:52,Destro35,I am hearing excuses
30-11-2018T01:22:53,Bgrmystr2,before they went to the theme park
30-11-2018T01:22:59,Bgrmystr2,yes you are
30-11-2018T01:23:01,Bgrmystr2,got a problem?
30-11-2018T01:23:18,Bgrmystr2,you dislike my excuses mr I haven't read either one?
30-11-2018T01:23:19,Bgrmystr2,:P
30-11-2018T01:23:20,Vatruvius,"I got a problem, a real bone to pick with you Bgr."
30-11-2018T01:23:22,Destro35,Nope they are fun
30-11-2018T01:23:25,SageSaga,http://ai.katbox.net/
30-11-2018T01:23:31,Vatruvius,XD
30-11-2018T01:23:34,Bgrmystr2,oh no bones :ptv-shock:
30-11-2018T01:23:48,Vatruvius,I shall remove one bone then poke you with it...
30-11-2018T01:24:03,Bgrmystr2,"as long as it's not one of my bones, we're fine"
30-11-2018T01:24:04,Vatruvius,Which bone shall I remove?
30-11-2018T01:24:09,Bgrmystr2,probably your leg bone
30-11-2018T01:24:11,Vatruvius,Do you have a preference.
30-11-2018T01:24:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,the femur
30-11-2018T01:24:19,Vatruvius,"No, no, your bones Bgr."
30-11-2018T01:24:24,Bgrmystr2,"oh, then no you're not allowed."
30-11-2018T01:24:30,Vatruvius,Which do you least like?
30-11-2018T01:24:37,Destro35,The comic looks like Twokinds when it first came out
30-11-2018T01:24:50,Vatruvius,Yosh! does?
30-11-2018T01:25:12,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, my finger bones are the ones I usually like the least a lot of times.. they're the ones that spend the most time messing up anyway."
30-11-2018T01:25:13,Vatruvius,"I mean, it had no color so...perhaps a little more but still good."
30-11-2018T01:25:26,Bgrmystr2,Tk had no color when he first made it as well
30-11-2018T01:25:26,ZRO4825,"Oh, you must mean early days of Yosh!"
30-11-2018T01:25:38,Bgrmystr2,but tom redid those pages
30-11-2018T01:25:41,Vatruvius,"Ohh yeah, but they have since been colored."
30-11-2018T01:25:44,ZRO4825,"Yeah, starting out was not much color, that gets better as ya go along, for sure. ^_^"
30-11-2018T01:26:04,Destro35,No the other one Artificial Incident
30-11-2018T01:26:24,Bgrmystr2,"AI started with color, lol"
30-11-2018T01:26:24,Vatruvius,Um...how?
30-11-2018T01:26:36,Vatruvius,AI was very recent in terms of Twokinds and Yosh!
30-11-2018T01:27:00,Vatruvius,I am puzzled...
30-11-2018T01:27:00,Bgrmystr2,some of the pages are black and white on purpose
30-11-2018T01:27:05,Vatruvius,Yeah.
30-11-2018T01:27:15,Bgrmystr2,but it starts with color
30-11-2018T01:27:18,Vatruvius,But I wouldn't say they look like Tom's early work.
30-11-2018T01:27:35,Destro35,yeah just the way it looked reminded me of it
30-11-2018T01:27:37,Bgrmystr2,"the opening page and first comic page both have color, but yeah they're not quite tom's early work"
30-11-2018T01:27:39,Vatruvius,Sage has a very distinct art style from Tom's..
30-11-2018T01:27:53,Destro35,A little
30-11-2018T01:28:13,SageSaga,a little?
30-11-2018T01:28:30,Vatruvius,Ouch...you have angered the dragon.

30-11-2018T01:31:59,Vatruvius,"He is in high school Bgr, perhaps just a little older."

30-11-2018T01:34:27,Destro35,Must be fun
30-11-2018T01:34:48,Vatruvius,"Absolutely, when I'm not losing my mind that is."
30-11-2018T01:34:50,Bgrmystr2,haha yeah I do live here actually.

30-11-2018T01:35:25,Destro35,I already did that on the old stream and i may have gone to far
30-11-2018T01:35:41,Vatruvius,"When Bgr talks, we do not great him with ""Hello!"" We say, ""Welcome home!"""
30-11-2018T01:35:52,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, noone has ever said that"
30-11-2018T01:35:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Welcome home me
30-11-2018T01:36:02,Bgrmystr2,lool
30-11-2018T01:36:14,Vatruvius,We have greeted you in such a way a couple of times Bgr.
30-11-2018T01:36:19,Bgrmystr2,have you?
30-11-2018T01:36:21,Bgrmystr2,I've never seen it.
30-11-2018T01:36:30,Bgrmystr2,:(
30-11-2018T01:36:32,Bgrmystr2,now I'm sad.
30-11-2018T01:36:49,Vatruvius,"Yes, I remember doing it twice. It was a group effort, everyone welcomed you home. Must have been about 2 months ago I think."
30-11-2018T01:36:51,Vatruvius,Maybe more.
30-11-2018T01:37:06,Bgrmystr2,nooo I don't remember this :ptv-shock::ptv-sad:
30-11-2018T01:37:15,Destro35,Maybe he was implying it
30-11-2018T01:37:17,Vatruvius,"Well, welcome home Bgr!"
30-11-2018T01:37:34,Bgrmystr2,"ayy, even though I didn't just get here, I'll take it."
30-11-2018T01:37:57,Vatruvius,"Too be honest, it is hard for me to tell when you head out."
30-11-2018T01:37:58,Vatruvius,XD
30-11-2018T01:38:05,Bgrmystr2,Head.. out..?
30-11-2018T01:38:11,Destro35,It is the thought that counts

30-11-2018T01:44:40,Bgrmystr2,the zombie idol one
30-11-2018T01:44:50,Bgrmystr2,haven't decided to jump in yet
30-11-2018T01:45:10,unsteddyphoenix,"The actual dance sequences are shitty cg, but I always skip that anyway"
30-11-2018T01:45:15,Vatruvius,Is it a sin that I have not found anime very interesting?
30-11-2018T01:45:22,Destro35,No thank you sticking to goblin slayer
30-11-2018T01:45:42,unsteddyphoenix,Goblin Slayer is actually pretty sweet
30-11-2018T01:45:51,unsteddyphoenix,And its not turning into a shitty harem anime yet like I expected
30-11-2018T01:45:56,RimaDraws,hey
30-11-2018T01:45:59,SageSaga,That Time I Was Reincarnated as a Slime  is better than Goblin Slayer
30-11-2018T01:46:02,Vatruvius,Hello Rima.
30-11-2018T01:46:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Rima

30-11-2018T01:46:20,Vatruvius,"Do not fight Sage, he always wins."
30-11-2018T01:46:30,Vatruvius,"Just accept, kiss ass, then move along."
30-11-2018T01:46:33,RimaDraws,guess i missed the stream
30-11-2018T01:46:44,Vatruvius,"Yeah, Tom is on a schedule now Rima."
30-11-2018T01:46:44,SageSaga,im streaming right now-
30-11-2018T01:46:48,Bgrmystr2,"not always, vatru. sometimes you can best sage in a battle of wits. :v"
30-11-2018T01:46:56,Bgrmystr2,it's rare though.
30-11-2018T01:47:08,Destro35,Ok then avoid the bull called egaS
30-11-2018T01:47:16,Vatruvius,Hmm...you have to be at least level 199 to even attempt that Bgr.
30-11-2018T01:47:53,Destro35,Ow
30-11-2018T01:47:58,Bgrmystr2,bruh I turned into a wizard 5 months ago
30-11-2018T01:48:12,Vatruvius,"Oh, how was it?"
30-11-2018T01:48:24,Bgrmystr2,Enlightening.
30-11-2018T01:48:31,Bgrmystr2,In the respect that nothing of value happened.
30-11-2018T01:48:41,Bgrmystr2,so..
30-11-2018T01:49:02,RimaDraws,hm
30-11-2018T01:49:14,Destro35,Hey can you guys see these texts
30-11-2018T01:49:23,Bgrmystr2,yes we can :o
30-11-2018T01:49:57,Vatruvius,"From my experience, which is limited, and from what I have seen in awesomely long D&D games, mages just are not my time."
30-11-2018T01:49:58,SageSaga,lol he thought i banned him
30-11-2018T01:50:00,Vatruvius,type*
30-11-2018T01:50:11,Vatruvius,lol
30-11-2018T01:50:23,Vatruvius,"I have been kicked once before, that scared me."

30-11-2018T01:50:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Daddy \o/
30-11-2018T01:51:02,Vatruvius,I much prefer the rogue that just pulls of the craziest shit and survives.
30-11-2018T01:51:04,unsteddyphoenix,Hey daddy
30-11-2018T01:51:20,Vatruvius,"Ohh, what is this, I rolled a 5, nah, that is a 22..."
30-11-2018T01:51:20,unsteddyphoenix,Also goblin slayer is probably better but i respect both your opinion and you as a person sage
30-11-2018T01:51:24,Dadrobit,"Back. Arcade was crowded as heck. Still got in my R-Type and Area 51 hits though, so it's all good."
30-11-2018T01:51:25,unsteddyphoenix,And I hope you have a nice day
30-11-2018T01:51:56,Vatruvius,unsteddy moderator status...removed...
30-11-2018T01:52:09,Vatruvius,XD
30-11-2018T01:52:12,Bgrmystr2,can sage do that?
30-11-2018T01:52:22,Bgrmystr2,tom's the one that made him a mod
30-11-2018T01:52:25,Vatruvius,Probably...?
30-11-2018T01:52:27,Dadrobit,Probably not?
30-11-2018T01:52:32,unsteddyphoenix,Lets not test
30-11-2018T01:52:35,SageSaga,ive read all of Goblin Slayer and Slime- Slime just keeps getting better
30-11-2018T01:52:35,Bgrmystr2,hahahaha
30-11-2018T01:52:45,SageSaga,Goblin Slayer doesnt change much
30-11-2018T01:52:55,unsteddyphoenix,So it DOESNT devolve into a harem
30-11-2018T01:53:01,SageSaga,<_<
30-11-2018T01:53:05,SageSaga,i didnt say that
30-11-2018T01:53:08,unsteddyphoenix,Fuck
30-11-2018T01:53:10,SageSaga,it just doesnt change much
30-11-2018T01:53:59,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, whatever. I'll probably end up reading them too"
30-11-2018T01:54:00,Destro35,Ok just more dead goblins
30-11-2018T01:54:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"""Hey kid are you hungry for some **EDGE**  Then check out goblin slayer, thats all its good for"""
30-11-2018T01:54:57,Destro35,?
30-11-2018T01:55:08,unsteddyphoenix,"The first episode was maximum edge, then it toned right down"
30-11-2018T01:55:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,They blew their edge load on the first date
30-11-2018T01:55:30,unsteddyphoenix,"I like the creative murder aspect, so if that continues then thats all I need"
30-11-2018T01:55:34,unsteddyphoenix,"Hell yes they did, jesus"
30-11-2018T01:55:39,Vatruvius,No dinner first?
30-11-2018T01:55:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,nope
30-11-2018T01:55:49,unsteddyphoenix,Tbh it was smart. It grabbed a lot of attention
30-11-2018T01:56:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Now people keep coming to see how hardcore it will be
30-11-2018T01:56:57,Destro35,Yeah especially with the first few scenes
30-11-2018T01:57:04,unsteddyphoenix,"And then it actually gets a plot, which keeps people around"
30-11-2018T01:57:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Just in time for season 2
30-11-2018T01:57:58,Vatruvius,"I do not get it, my Spotify playlist has 30+ songs in it, only 2 or 3 of which are Undertale remixes, not all Spotify suggests are Undertale remixes, nothing else!"
30-11-2018T01:58:00,Destro35,Yay
30-11-2018T01:58:23,Vatruvius,now*
30-11-2018T01:58:27,Destro35,Ha serves you right
30-11-2018T01:59:10,Vatruvius,Excuse me...!?
30-11-2018T01:59:11,Bgrmystr2,..for what though?
30-11-2018T02:01:02,SageSaga,the point of the first episode is to make you hate goblins as much as Goblin Slayer and not to think of them as weak creature not fit for your sword
30-11-2018T02:01:49,Destro35,"""We have greeted you in such a way a couple of times Bgr."""
30-11-2018T02:01:52,SageSaga,unfortunately it looks like they hired a hentai artist to do the scene and instead of just horrifying they tried to make it hentai and that is what has everyone angry
30-11-2018T02:02:08,LOGANWOLF,Im back destro
30-11-2018T02:02:11,Destro35,That is good point
30-11-2018T02:02:19,Bgrmystr2,I don't understand how that is relevant at all
30-11-2018T02:02:23,Vatruvius,^
30-11-2018T02:02:25,Bgrmystr2,"that was to me, not to you"
30-11-2018T02:02:25,Destro35,Hi
30-11-2018T02:02:35,unsteddyphoenix,"Thats just how anime is, really."
30-11-2018T02:02:36,Bgrmystr2,so I dunno what you're upset about?
30-11-2018T02:02:41,LOGANWOLF,Done putting away the gear for dj stuff
30-11-2018T02:02:45,Bgrmystr2,it wasn't even mean or bad
30-11-2018T02:02:56,Bgrmystr2,the fuck even xD
30-11-2018T02:03:13,Destro35,I don't know either
30-11-2018T02:03:16,Vatruvius,I fail how to see that is connect to me deserving terrible Spotify song suggestions?
30-11-2018T02:03:33,Bgrmystr2,"there's some good ones out there though, vatru"
30-11-2018T02:03:50,Destro35,Eh Spotify is stupid in my opinion
30-11-2018T02:04:06,LOGANWOLF,Just got back and dont know whwhats going on:ptv-confused:
30-11-2018T02:04:13,Bgrmystr2,"lol sage, they probably did it to catch attention anyway"
30-11-2018T02:04:22,Bgrmystr2,press is press
30-11-2018T02:04:24,Vatruvius,"Yeah, I have those in my playlist. But when trying to find new songs to add to my playlist, I do not want to only hear Undertale remixes. I have so many other songs in there."
30-11-2018T02:04:45,Vatruvius,"What did Sage say, I lost connection."
30-11-2018T02:04:48,SageSaga,bgr- there is such thing as bad press
30-11-2018T02:04:56,Bgrmystr2,"if I had spotify, it'd probably ONLY give me touhou remixes, which.. honestly wouldn't bother me"
30-11-2018T02:05:00,unsteddyphoenix,All press is good press?
30-11-2018T02:05:09,Bgrmystr2,"yes I know sage, but even bad press spreads the title of the show to more people"
30-11-2018T02:05:24,SageSaga,yeah - and can get it banned from Crunchy Roll
30-11-2018T02:05:42,unsteddyphoenix,Did it?
30-11-2018T02:05:50,Bgrmystr2,"xD well, it's CR. It's really not surprising."
30-11-2018T02:05:51,SageSaga,close
30-11-2018T02:05:56,Destro35,"Logan nothing big has happened but we were talking about anime, comics that Sage made,  D&D, and other things"
30-11-2018T02:06:06,unsteddyphoenix,high risk high reward~
30-11-2018T02:06:33,Vatruvius,Some risks are to high though unsteddy...
30-11-2018T02:06:43,Vatruvius,They yield nothing sometimes.
30-11-2018T02:06:49,LOGANWOLF,Ahh thanks for the heads up ^.^
30-11-2018T02:06:53,Vatruvius,Risk does not guarantee reward.
30-11-2018T02:06:59,Dadrobit,:/ I almost wish I were into anime more. There's a lot of content I'm missing out on.
30-11-2018T02:07:09,unsteddyphoenix,"Yes Vat, very good"
30-11-2018T02:07:17,unsteddyphoenix,"That is why it's called a ""risk"""
30-11-2018T02:07:21,Bgrmystr2,xDD
30-11-2018T02:07:25,Vatruvius,"I have zero interest in anime Dadro, so you are not alone. My sister is the anime person, I am the comic person."
30-11-2018T02:07:29,Bgrmystr2,"took the words right outta my mouth, phoenix"
30-11-2018T02:07:36,Bgrmystr2,"why not both, vatru?"
30-11-2018T02:07:47,Bgrmystr2,it's just another medium
30-11-2018T02:07:49,SageSaga,and sometimes you risk something and you end up attracting the wrong people
30-11-2018T02:08:03,Vatruvius,"Something about anime just puts me off, I can't explain it."
30-11-2018T02:08:05,unsteddyphoenix,"People who are only ""into"" some things I dont quite understand"
30-11-2018T02:08:14,LOGANWOLF,I got kicked all of a sudden :ptv-laugh:
30-11-2018T02:08:19,Destro35,Life is full of risks
30-11-2018T02:08:22,unsteddyphoenix,"97% of everything is bad, you need to get the 3% of stuff"
30-11-2018T02:08:25,Dadrobit,"Agreed, unsteddy."
30-11-2018T02:08:28,unsteddyphoenix,No matter what type of content it is
30-11-2018T02:08:33,LOGANWOLF,And back :ptv-right:
30-11-2018T02:08:55,Dadrobit,Sturgeon's law
30-11-2018T02:09:08,Dadrobit,90% Of Everything Is Shit
30-11-2018T02:09:29,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah
30-11-2018T02:09:31,LOGANWOLF,What about the 10%?
30-11-2018T02:09:38,unsteddyphoenix,Except thats from a time where there was less stuff
30-11-2018T02:09:43,unsteddyphoenix,Now it's 97%
30-11-2018T02:09:46,Vatruvius,I am trying to think of an example that disproves that Dadro...having difficulties.
30-11-2018T02:09:53,unsteddyphoenix,"97.43 reoccuring, specifically"
30-11-2018T02:09:55,Destro35,I agree with you on that
30-11-2018T02:09:59,Bgrmystr2,you can't vatru XD
30-11-2018T02:10:51,Vatruvius,"Well, far less than 97% of fruit at the store is bad..."
30-11-2018T02:10:53,LOGANWOLF,Does anyone have any suggestions on how should i name my main character for my future comic?
30-11-2018T02:10:57,Vatruvius,"I know, lousy attempt."
30-11-2018T02:11:13,Bgrmystr2,"32.3333% chance, repeating of course. :V"
30-11-2018T02:11:18,Dadrobit,"For every Violet Evergarden, there's another season of some bullshit samey ass high school harem anime."
30-11-2018T02:11:24,Destro35,What gender and race
30-11-2018T02:11:25,Vatruvius,"Entirely up to you, I spent far too much time doing that for my characters."
30-11-2018T02:12:07,unsteddyphoenix,not wrong
30-11-2018T02:12:11,SageSaga,"Dont take suggestions from others on what to name your character, and dont name them after yourself"
30-11-2018T02:12:15,Vatruvius,"I realize saying ""far too much time"" sounds negative but not at all."
30-11-2018T02:12:19,LOGANWOLF,Well i have the name for my characters like solaris the solar clan princes and comet the prince of demon shadow clan
30-11-2018T02:12:21,Dadrobit,Wading through all that bullshit is just not worth the tim imo.
30-11-2018T02:12:25,Dadrobit,time*
30-11-2018T02:12:29,ZRO4825,But I like naming things after Ran :c
30-11-2018T02:13:11,Dadrobit,"What are you talking about, Sage? Mary Sue Self Inserts are the only thing worth putting in webcomics!"
30-11-2018T02:13:13,LOGANWOLF,I dont know how should i name like characters that are someone like native and outworldy names
30-11-2018T02:13:26,Dadrobit,"Also, enter stage left: Sturgeon's law."
30-11-2018T02:13:43,Vatruvius,"I think a great way of figuring out how to name your characters is read other comics and see how other authors named their characters. The more content under your belt, the more you can be influenced by."
30-11-2018T02:13:49,SageSaga,if you dont know how to name your characters then you have more work to do
30-11-2018T02:14:04,Destro35,Ok i will take Sages advice and let you pick them yourself *Whispers to Logan*
30-11-2018T02:14:42,LOGANWOLF,Have you heard the names they put in Warrior Cats and other future books?
30-11-2018T02:14:48,Bgrmystr2,"you say that vatru, but yet you don't watch anime?"
30-11-2018T02:14:51,DarthRexKing,Hero Academia! o3o
30-11-2018T02:15:01,Vatruvius,All I can say is that no name anyone could have suggested to me would have satisfied how I saw my characters.
30-11-2018T02:15:02,SageSaga,Destro- ive been drawing and writing comics since before you were born
30-11-2018T02:15:04,Bgrmystr2,you're depriving yourself of a HUGE amount of content.
30-11-2018T02:15:05,Dadrobit,"Creating names that are esoteric and or confusing for the sake of ""it sounds cool in my head"" is probably a bad way to start. Just sayin'."
30-11-2018T02:15:11,Vatruvius,I had to come up with them on my own and spent a great deal of time on them.
30-11-2018T02:15:16,LOGANWOLF,Im trying not to go exactly like theirs but in a somewhat similar way
30-11-2018T02:15:16,Destro35,Here we go
30-11-2018T02:16:09,Destro35,Or right down the first name that comes to mind and change it if need be
30-11-2018T02:16:17,Vatruvius,"Do not be impatient about it, creating something from scratch is not easy and takes time."
30-11-2018T02:16:47,Vatruvius,"I mean, both Tom and Sage have been writing comics for many years and are not done."
30-11-2018T02:17:00,LOGANWOLF,"I know that, but i get very... umm excited about trying to find out at the same time"
30-11-2018T02:17:07,Vatruvius,Writing a comic is not going to be a one summer/one year deal.
30-11-2018T02:17:38,Vatruvius,"I understand, truly. But if you are having a hard time take a break and come back to it with a different frame of mine."
30-11-2018T02:18:00,Vatruvius,I have found that names and ideas kind of pop out of nowhere while I drive or sit in class or go to work.
30-11-2018T02:18:02,Destro35,Well they do have patreon people asking for pictures to be made and other stuff but continue
30-11-2018T02:18:18,LOGANWOLF,Yep heard of that too
30-11-2018T02:18:20,Vatruvius,That is not due to lack of creativity.
30-11-2018T02:18:41,Vatruvius,Tom and Sage are participating with their supporters.
30-11-2018T02:18:51,Vatruvius,Which is something I look forward to in the future.
30-11-2018T02:19:06,Destro35,Good for you
30-11-2018T02:19:09,LOGANWOLF,"Cool, hopefully it happens soon"
30-11-2018T02:19:27,LOGANWOLF,Then i can ask advices on comming up with ideas for a comic
30-11-2018T02:20:10,SageSaga,im saying dont ask here because you get creepy people giving dumb suggestions because they think they know something
30-11-2018T02:20:19,Vatruvius,"Do not wait. I would start collecting all your ideas in one place. In my case, I started writing a google doc with everything I thought about."
30-11-2018T02:20:33,Destro35,I feel like we are children listening to life advice
30-11-2018T02:20:33,Vatruvius,"Some I came back and deleted, changed, rewrote, but write them down."
30-11-2018T02:20:42,SageSaga,you are a child
30-11-2018T02:20:52,Vatruvius,No joke...
30-11-2018T02:20:53,LOGANWOLF,Okay
30-11-2018T02:20:54,Destro35,Good id
30-11-2018T02:21:05,LOGANWOLF,Never thought of that
30-11-2018T02:21:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,wah wah baby pharaoh cry
30-11-2018T02:21:13,Destro35,ea
30-11-2018T02:21:20,LOGANWOLF,👀
30-11-2018T02:21:26,Dadrobit,Ironic that the hug pharoh needs to be held.
30-11-2018T02:21:34,Dadrobit,Pharaoh
30-11-2018T02:21:45,Vatruvius,"I never thought just a couple years of experience made such a difference in high school but it does. And Sage, well he has years of experience over me."
30-11-2018T02:22:06,Vatruvius,I welcome his advice when it came to my webcomic. They were good and useful.
30-11-2018T02:22:22,Destro35,Yeah he is old i think
30-11-2018T02:22:27,Vatruvius,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
30-11-2018T02:22:35,Vatruvius,:ctwokinds-RaineEep:
30-11-2018T02:22:56,LOGANWOLF,Are you assuming his age?! :ptv-shock::ptv-nope:
30-11-2018T02:22:59,Vatruvius,I would not say old.
30-11-2018T02:23:05,ZRO4825,Who you callin old? *shakes cane*
30-11-2018T02:23:11,SageSaga,I'm the one making comics every week while people message me begging for me to put their ugly OCs in my work.
30-11-2018T02:23:13,LOGANWOLF,Lol
30-11-2018T02:23:47,Vatruvius,"Really, I feel for you Sage. Mental note, clarify no OCs..."
30-11-2018T02:23:54,Destro35,Look that was a compliment with age comes wisdom which is something I lack apparently
30-11-2018T02:24:30,Vatruvius,I would not consider anyone below the age of 20 to have a great deal of experience. It is just what I have found.
30-11-2018T02:24:34,LOGANWOLF,Wisdom and knowledge is most important when it comes to aging
30-11-2018T02:24:41,ZRO4825,"pffft, more like 25 <_<;;"
30-11-2018T02:24:44,Vatruvius,You have a sort of eye opening experience after that.
30-11-2018T02:24:57,ZRO4825,20's around the age where people start thinking they've got shit figured out and around 25 they start realizing how little they actually did have...
30-11-2018T02:25:11,Vatruvius,"Well, I am 21 ZRO..."
30-11-2018T02:25:13,SageSaga,"you also lose some patience when it comes to people when you have a bunch of people saying ""Add my character so they can have sex with your characters!"""
30-11-2018T02:25:14,LOGANWOLF,Thata true
30-11-2018T02:25:18,Destro35,Ok
30-11-2018T02:25:27,LOGANWOLF,Woah
30-11-2018T02:25:28,Vatruvius,:ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:
30-11-2018T02:25:32,Bgrmystr2,you'd be surprised at how young some people have matured
30-11-2018T02:25:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Vat you're younger then me...... Rip me being the chat baby
30-11-2018T02:25:38,Bgrmystr2,but it's far and few between
30-11-2018T02:25:39,LOGANWOLF,That escalated fast
30-11-2018T02:25:45,SageSaga,you think Tom hasn't had someone ask to be put in so they can have sex with Flora?
30-11-2018T02:25:55,Bgrmystr2,lool
30-11-2018T02:25:59,Vatruvius,"You are the baby, I am the infant, any younger are the new borns."
30-11-2018T02:26:07,LOGANWOLF,Wow... Lol
30-11-2018T02:26:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
30-11-2018T02:26:28,Vatruvius,"I would assume Kat more often, but yeah."
30-11-2018T02:26:49,ZRO4825,"Well, I mean, Kat WAS the one bred for fun times..."
30-11-2018T02:26:49,Vatruvius,With internet comes some...not wanted suggestions.
30-11-2018T02:27:00,Vatruvius,Does not me she has to be...
30-11-2018T02:27:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I wonder If I can get tom to put me in TK so I can glomp Zen
30-11-2018T02:27:07,LOGANWOLF,"Honestly, i think people asked tom to pit thwir oc to have ""reproduction"" with katherin"
30-11-2018T02:27:12,Destro35,I hate my generation they are all stupid
30-11-2018T02:27:16,LOGANWOLF,Its weird
30-11-2018T02:27:24,SageSaga,all generations are stupid Destro
30-11-2018T02:27:29,Dadrobit,*He Who Shall Not Be Named Intensifies*
30-11-2018T02:27:38,Vatruvius,"You might be able to do that Marv, just suggest what your character would be, loosely, with Zen and bingo."
30-11-2018T02:27:38,Bgrmystr2,lolo yeah what sage said
30-11-2018T02:27:47,LOGANWOLF,Lol harry potter references
30-11-2018T02:27:52,Bgrmystr2,the current generation is stupid to the previous generation and vice versa
30-11-2018T02:28:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Lol Vat
30-11-2018T02:28:02,Bgrmystr2,"and it's been the same generation after generation, and always will be,."
30-11-2018T02:28:07,Dadrobit,"No. Unfortunately, that is a TwoKinds history reference."
30-11-2018T02:28:34,Bgrmystr2,yeah.. and I know who he is.
30-11-2018T02:28:41,Destro35,"""Take the canoli and leave the gun"""
30-11-2018T02:28:45,LOGANWOLF,Huh... I never knew that :/
30-11-2018T02:28:47,unsteddyphoenix,"Generations do vary in intelligence, IQ wise"
30-11-2018T02:28:58,Bgrmystr2,"gotta lurk more, Logan"
30-11-2018T02:29:03,Bgrmystr2,"lurk more, learn more."
30-11-2018T02:29:04,ZRO4825,"Yeah, and it seems to keep going down on average..."
30-11-2018T02:29:05,Vatruvius,"For example Marv, Zen is hugged by some random, and strikingly handsome, brown wolf keidran."
30-11-2018T02:29:08,LOGANWOLF,I know 😅
30-11-2018T02:29:33,Dadrobit,"For the uninitiated, do not try to self insert yourself into someone's comic to have incestuous sex with one of the characters. That's a quick way to tarnish yourself forever."
30-11-2018T02:29:36,LOGANWOLF,I have trouble paying attention to my surroundings 😅
30-11-2018T02:30:01,SageSaga,its not going down - we are just getting better averages because we have access to more people rapidly and can correlate data faster
30-11-2018T02:30:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Vat Gonna show what that character would look like XD
30-11-2018T02:30:22,Destro35,Sage you have an interesting comic
30-11-2018T02:30:54,Destro35,The Artificial Incident

30-11-2018T02:33:18,Vatruvius,Now for the other 4!
30-11-2018T02:33:19,Vatruvius,XD
30-11-2018T02:33:21,Bgrmystr2,the godrays are real
30-11-2018T02:33:51,Destro35,Words over my head
30-11-2018T02:34:35,Vatruvius,"Oh my, that stream offline page..."
30-11-2018T02:35:39,Bgrmystr2,oh sage's offline image
30-11-2018T02:35:41,Bgrmystr2,yeah it's nice
30-11-2018T02:36:01,Vatruvius,I remember briefly seeing it get sketched.
30-11-2018T02:36:05,LOGANWOLF,"Im back, again 😅"
30-11-2018T02:36:06,Vatruvius,"Or colored, one of those."
30-11-2018T02:36:25,Destro35,Hi
30-11-2018T02:36:36,LOGANWOLF,Hi destro
30-11-2018T02:37:41,Destro35,So what have you been doing also call me Des
30-11-2018T02:39:05,Bgrmystr2,you know.. we won't remember that
30-11-2018T02:39:33,Destro35,I will continue to remind you all
30-11-2018T02:39:54,Bgrmystr2,"the more you remind people, the more some people will not do that thing you tell them to do on purpose."
30-11-2018T02:40:40,Destro35,Ok fine but don't blame me if you get tired of spelling out Destro
30-11-2018T02:40:42,DarthRexKing,That seems counterproductive.
30-11-2018T02:40:43,Vatruvius,"I remember, but to be honest the more you show up here and become a regular the more likely people will just call you Des."
30-11-2018T02:40:45,DarthRexKing,"Anyway, Goodnight!"
30-11-2018T02:41:07,Bgrmystr2,"I don't get tired of spelling out the name, that's just silly lol"
30-11-2018T02:41:11,Vatruvius,After awhile I have been referred to by just Vat.
30-11-2018T02:41:17,Bgrmystr2,I call dadro dadro all the time
30-11-2018T02:41:23,Bgrmystr2,I still call Vatru as such

30-11-2018T02:58:36,Vatruvius,The movies have been out for a while now. We came up with the name Drex about 6 months ago. I remember because my 'x' key was broken and it was a pain in the ass to type the name and join our fun.
30-11-2018T02:58:39,LOGANWOLF,"I mean ""do"""
30-11-2018T02:58:53,Bgrmystr2,ooooh was it only 6 months?

30-11-2018T03:00:36,Vatruvius,"Yeah, not that long ago. I know it was not that long because I have only been a patron of Tom's for 8 months now, going on 9."

30-11-2018T03:29:07,Destro35,Happens once a day a least if i am lucky
30-11-2018T03:29:10,LOGANWOLF,This either kickes me out of the group and join back in or kick me out of the app and open again xd
30-11-2018T03:30:07,Destro35,Happens on one app mainly
30-11-2018T03:30:39,LOGANWOLF,I never had an app kick me out of something except for this one :/

30-11-2018T03:45:23,Bgrmystr2,"I was the one that said to lurk more probably, and it's because if you don't know something happened, that's probably because you were not here observing what happened when it happened, or observing people talking about it."
30-11-2018T03:45:44,Bgrmystr2,"it's fundamentally true, observing is a good way to learn things."
30-11-2018T03:45:49,LOGANWOLF,I know that and welcome back bgr

30-11-2018T03:47:03,Bgrmystr2,"the fact that you had to specifically note that it was true makes me skeptical that it is, in fact, true."
30-11-2018T03:47:06,Destro35,It is sad
30-11-2018T03:47:30,Bgrmystr2,and I don't really care? I've had had times in life.
30-11-2018T03:47:32,Bgrmystr2,It happens.
30-11-2018T03:47:35,Bgrmystr2,then you move on.

30-11-2018T15:01:36,Bgrmystr2,the top panel is completely different now
30-11-2018T15:01:40,SageSaga,yep
30-11-2018T15:01:48,Bgrmystr2,why though? it looked fine
30-11-2018T15:01:55,SageSaga,i hated it
30-11-2018T15:02:00,SageSaga,it looked so flat

30-11-2018T15:02:24,SageSaga,it's still there
30-11-2018T15:02:28,Twokinds,Nice! I think it's an improvement
30-11-2018T15:03:19,Bgrmystr2,I liked that it showed more of the area honestly.
30-11-2018T15:03:46,SageSaga,well Kaylin is pointing out that building specifically

30-11-2018T15:03:56,Bgrmystr2,yeah
30-11-2018T15:04:01,Bgrmystr2,it probably fits better
30-11-2018T15:05:03,SageSaga,i think it looks more worn and the buildings behind it - well one is burned to the ground so thats good- looks more abandoned/destroyed

30-11-2018T15:19:54,SageSaga,yep
30-11-2018T15:20:38,Bgrmystr2,why so?
30-11-2018T15:21:07,SageSaga,i want the building to look larger- it's important for a scene later

30-11-2018T16:02:25,Twokinds,That's highway robbery

30-11-2018T16:03:57,ThingsAreMoving,I mean free market should make the prices lower than governmetnt-handled health services like in Europe or canada
30-11-2018T16:04:03,CrimsonQuill,That's a huge amiunt.
30-11-2018T16:04:04,CrimsonQuill,amount
30-11-2018T16:04:09,ThingsAreMoving,but instead the prices are absurd

30-11-2018T16:04:18,Twokinds,"Even the cheap plan is 3,300"

30-11-2018T16:05:15,CrimsonQuill,"Sneaky,"
30-11-2018T16:05:44,Vatruvius,I have a friend up in Canada who recently got in an accident crossing the border into the US. Our ambulance took him back over to one of his hospitals and gave him an MRI and a dozen other test unthinkable to any regular American. The ambulance cost
30-11-2018T16:05:51,Vatruvius,is high enough for me think you.
30-11-2018T16:05:57,Vatruvius,thank*
30-11-2018T16:07:07,ThingsAreMoving,The ambulance cost should be (cost of fuel + (cost of medical staff / hour) + cost of medicine [if administered])
30-11-2018T16:07:43,Vatruvius,"The way he told it, his doctor burned our ambulance responders by saying they actually take care of their own in Canada..."
30-11-2018T16:07:45,SageSaga,socialized medicine seems to make more sense because if everyone has treatment you reduce the number of illnesses in the country and reduce the spread leading to a more efficient society

30-11-2018T16:19:48,ThingsAreMoving,holy... that's more than what I pay for gas + electrical+ council tax bill for a 3-person house
30-11-2018T16:20:17,Vatruvius,"Wow, you got cheap coverage Things"
30-11-2018T16:20:20,Twokinds,"lol luckily for regular doctor visits, it's only $50"
30-11-2018T16:20:40,Twokinds,It's definitely the most expensive thing I pay for.
30-11-2018T16:20:43,Vatruvius,"Still, that is around a 20% increase in medical costs a month."
30-11-2018T16:21:09,ThingsAreMoving,"45 pounds for  gas, 70 for electricity and 108 for council tax"
30-11-2018T16:21:21,ThingsAreMoving,and it's still one of the highest in uk
30-11-2018T16:21:32,Vatruvius,"What is that converted to US dollars, about the same right?"
30-11-2018T16:21:38,ThingsAreMoving,roughly
30-11-2018T16:22:02,ThingsAreMoving,"10usd = 7,8gbp"
30-11-2018T16:22:02,Vatruvius,$285
30-11-2018T16:22:03,SageSaga,add 28% to your pound to get USD
30-11-2018T16:22:37,Vatruvius,28% ?
30-11-2018T16:22:53,Vatruvius,"Yup, that is right."
30-11-2018T16:23:30,Vatruvius,I just used a browser calculator...
30-11-2018T16:23:30,FoxxTrotter,It is...1 GBP=$1.28 USD.
30-11-2018T16:23:49,ThingsAreMoving,I'm paying for national health fund every month even though in the past seven years I've been to a doctor only three times now
30-11-2018T16:23:58,ThingsAreMoving,but It's fair
30-11-2018T16:24:12,SageSaga,that's good
30-11-2018T16:24:16,Mihari,I've been to a doctor or ER 18 times this year...
30-11-2018T16:24:19,Mihari,Paid for itself.
30-11-2018T16:24:19,SageSaga,you are helping everyone stay healthy
30-11-2018T16:24:37,Vatruvius,18 times!?
30-11-2018T16:24:43,Mihari,It's been one of those years.
30-11-2018T16:24:51,Vatruvius,Sorry to hear that.
30-11-2018T16:25:00,Mihari,A lot of it was routine checkups or imaging
30-11-2018T16:25:04,ThingsAreMoving,aw
30-11-2018T16:25:08,Mihari,"When you get to be my age and a woman, lot to check XD"
30-11-2018T16:25:08,SageSaga,unfortunately we pay insurance companies and not the health departments directly
30-11-2018T16:25:11,Vatruvius,"I guess I am lucky, that last time I visited a doctor must have been 6 years ago or something. Been healthy."
30-11-2018T16:25:31,Twokinds,I probably should get a checkup if only to update my shots
30-11-2018T16:25:39,SageSaga,i have to go to the doctor ever 3 months
30-11-2018T16:25:41,Vatruvius,I don't get shots...
30-11-2018T16:25:56,Bgrmystr2,lol mihari.. my mother's in her late 50s and hasn't gone to the hospital that many times in the past decade
30-11-2018T16:26:02,ThingsAreMoving,well for every 100 pounds I earn I pay roughly 8 for national insurance
30-11-2018T16:26:07,Twokinds,I don't think I've had a tetanus booster in more than 10 years.
30-11-2018T16:26:10,Mihari,Good for you mother?
30-11-2018T16:26:12,ThingsAreMoving,8% is pretty fair
30-11-2018T16:26:27,FoxxTrotter,"Yeah, I need to get a TD shot myself."
30-11-2018T16:26:28,Bgrmystr2,just seems a bit much imo
30-11-2018T16:26:33,ThingsAreMoving,lol my last tetanus shot was 15 years ago
30-11-2018T16:26:34,Mihari,Shit and life happen.
30-11-2018T16:26:47,Mihari,Sometimes more than we like.
30-11-2018T16:27:01,ThingsAreMoving,truth
30-11-2018T16:27:15,Vatruvius,I think my last tetanus shot was right before high school which was in 2012.
30-11-2018T16:27:21,FoxxTrotter,May need to get another MMR shot as well. Haven't had one since college.
30-11-2018T16:27:29,ThingsAreMoving,one day you can be healthy and next day you need 10+ checkups just to determine what's ailing you
30-11-2018T16:27:41,ThingsAreMoving,aging is a pain
30-11-2018T16:28:06,Mihari,"I'm in really great shape too, but genetics screws me over."
30-11-2018T16:28:14,Vatruvius,"In my experience and my mother's, we do a better job of determining our ailments than our doctors that just give us a prescription for the symptom."
30-11-2018T16:29:02,Vatruvius,I am referring to general doctors mine you.
30-11-2018T16:29:06,Vatruvius,mind*
30-11-2018T16:29:24,Vatruvius,There are some really good doctors out there that try to find what is causing your problem.
30-11-2018T16:29:27,ThingsAreMoving,"Yeah, Vat. Living on my own for 10+ years has taught me how to deal with most of stuff that normally would require a visit to the doctor. I only go to one once I can't solve my problems on my own"
30-11-2018T16:29:58,ThingsAreMoving,"Flu, or cold? 4 days to recover. Torn ligament? 2 weeks and I'm good to go"
30-11-2018T16:30:23,SageSaga,so once you figure out what you are ill with- what do you do? Burn herbs and dance the illness away?
30-11-2018T16:30:35,Bgrmystr2,duh sage
30-11-2018T16:30:45,Bgrmystr2,with candles under the blood moon
30-11-2018T16:30:45,ThingsAreMoving,"Nope, I figure out through trial and error what's best for my predicament"
30-11-2018T16:30:52,Bgrmystr2,no things damnit
30-11-2018T16:30:58,Bgrmystr2,don't ruin my headcanon
30-11-2018T16:31:06,ThingsAreMoving,L.O.G.I.C.
30-11-2018T16:31:10,Bgrmystr2,xD
30-11-2018T16:31:11,FoxxTrotter,You lose. :0P
30-11-2018T16:31:33,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: maybe next time
30-11-2018T16:31:40,Vatruvius,"With a sickness, bed rest for the most part."
30-11-2018T16:31:46,Vatruvius,Even for the flu...
30-11-2018T16:31:50,SageSaga,doctors tell you to take a medicine because its the safest and fastest way to not only determine what illness you have but get rid of it
30-11-2018T16:32:06,Vatruvius,"I mean, the flu shot only has a 50/50 chance of being the right one for the year."
30-11-2018T16:32:33,SageSaga,people die from the Flu so a 50/50 chance of being immune can be a great benifit
30-11-2018T16:32:45,Vatruvius,"No medication can hasten the ending of the flu once you have it, it is a virus not a bacteria."
30-11-2018T16:33:02,ThingsAreMoving,weeeeeell... only extremely young/old people die of flu
30-11-2018T16:33:12,FoxxTrotter,Most of the time.
30-11-2018T16:33:13,ThingsAreMoving,or people with impaired immune systems
30-11-2018T16:33:20,Vatruvius,Those who die are typically the elderly with weakened immune systems and and young exposed to too many shots.
30-11-2018T16:33:25,SageSaga,or people who have complications
30-11-2018T16:33:29,ThingsAreMoving,but in that case every illness is dangerous
30-11-2018T16:33:35,ThingsAreMoving,not just flu
30-11-2018T16:33:37,Mihari,https://www.today.com/health/21-year-old-fitness-buff-s-death-flu-shows-risks-t121057
30-11-2018T16:33:51,Mihari,"Case and point, it happens."
30-11-2018T16:34:22,ThingsAreMoving,"Yeah, Mihari. I had a friend at the uni, dude was an athlete, 21 y/o and died of heart failure"
30-11-2018T16:34:28,Vatruvius,"I would not trust that Mihari, that is a way off chance and the human health has so many variables it is not easy to just say one thing is the cause."
30-11-2018T16:34:29,ThingsAreMoving,thigs like that just happen
30-11-2018T16:34:34,SageSaga,also if you take the shot and it does help prevent it then you also dont spread it as much so you reduce the impact to the society
30-11-2018T16:34:47,Mihari,"Anything can happen, but you can just shrug off and say it won't happen."
30-11-2018T16:35:22,ThingsAreMoving,100% agree Sage.
30-11-2018T16:35:22,Vatruvius,"It is part of the propaganda to get your shots. And that is not me saying that, that is from a number of top doctors opposed the this ""get a shot for everything"" mentality."
30-11-2018T16:35:51,Vatruvius,I would not go back to school with the flu like some do...that is just me.
30-11-2018T16:35:53,Mihari,"I agree no need to get a shot for everything, but the flu isn't everything."
30-11-2018T16:35:58,Vatruvius,I alone cannot prevent an epidemic.
30-11-2018T16:36:00,FoxxTrotter,"Yeah... so long as the CDC predicts the correct strain of influenza for the season. Although, the vaccine could still have some good effect regardless."
30-11-2018T16:36:00,ThingsAreMoving,The only reason not to get vaccinated is if you have underdeveloped immune system
30-11-2018T16:36:05,SageSaga,do you think vaccines cause autism?
30-11-2018T16:36:10,Mihari,An epidemic starts with one.
30-11-2018T16:36:27,ThingsAreMoving,I mean like people with down's syndrome have impaired immune system  and should have vaccines adjusted to them
30-11-2018T16:37:24,SageSaga,it's called herd immunity- you get shots so the people who cant are protected
30-11-2018T16:37:32,Vatruvius,"Autism, not sure. I am skeptical. But one think I do not about vaccines, the mercury and aluminum in them are not good for your body. I have seen a significant improvement to my health and my family's seen we have stayed vaccinations 5 years ago."
30-11-2018T16:37:44,ThingsAreMoving,"My friends have a son with down's syndrome and the did not vaccinate him, but the mother had breastfed him for 12+ months and all the antibodies she developed over the time were transferred to him"
30-11-2018T16:37:59,Vatruvius,"Oh yeah Sage, learned that in biology."
30-11-2018T16:38:02,ThingsAreMoving,"Vat, you eat chlorine in table salt"
30-11-2018T16:38:11,ThingsAreMoving,there's selenium in your hair
30-11-2018T16:38:26,Vatruvius,I don't use table salt...
30-11-2018T16:38:30,ThingsAreMoving,just cause some elements are present in molecules does'nt mean they're harmful
30-11-2018T16:38:48,Bgrmystr2,"do you eat your hair, Things?"
30-11-2018T16:38:51,ThingsAreMoving,yes
30-11-2018T16:38:52,Vatruvius,I am not trying to start a heated debate...let's just drop this.
30-11-2018T16:38:58,Bgrmystr2,that might be a you problem lol
30-11-2018T16:39:03,Bgrmystr2,not a general problem.
30-11-2018T16:39:15,Bgrmystr2,xD
30-11-2018T16:39:16,ThingsAreMoving,"i nibble on my moustache, but that's not related to the topis, is it? :P"
30-11-2018T16:39:25,SageSaga,im just concerned you are a science denier - next think you know - you become a flat earther
30-11-2018T16:39:25,Bgrmystr2,uhh
30-11-2018T16:39:31,FoxxTrotter,TMI.
30-11-2018T16:39:34,ThingsAreMoving,topic*
30-11-2018T16:40:03,Vatruvius,"I love science Sage, and I do not try to create an opinion without substantial facts."
30-11-2018T16:40:15,Bgrmystr2,I'm gonna go with blarg :ptv-wondering:
30-11-2018T16:40:47,ThingsAreMoving,it's only blarg if you don't keep your facial hair clean
30-11-2018T16:41:15,SageSaga,bringing up mercury and aluminum in vaccines isnt something to bring up when asked about them though.
30-11-2018T16:41:15,Vatruvius,"The CDC has research proving the mercury and aluminum in the vaccines are not conducive to a healthy living, especially to developing infants who receive 7 vaccines minutes after birth."
30-11-2018T16:41:34,Bgrmystr2,"No I mean you gave me a yes or no things, and I'm not sure, so blarg. :u"
30-11-2018T16:41:36,SageSaga,"that's like when someone brings up water you say ""Ah yes, water, everyone who drinks it dies"""
30-11-2018T16:42:08,Vatruvius,"Not even close Sage, but I am aware I am an outlier in this subject so I rather not get into a debate."
30-11-2018T16:42:08,ThingsAreMoving,"Aww, bgr taking the safe route :ctwokinds-rose:"
30-11-2018T16:42:22,Bgrmystr2,this time yep
30-11-2018T16:42:47,SageSaga,then why bring it up when you should also know those trace amounts are harmless even if you multiply them 20 times?
30-11-2018T16:44:06,Vatruvius,"They are not in trace amounts, the mercury is used to preserve the the vaccine, the aluminum is used to excite and over reaction from your immune system so it start creating antibodies for the virus the vaccine is for. With out that stimulant your body"
30-11-2018T16:44:20,Vatruvius,would take care of the vaccine without creating antibodies.
30-11-2018T16:44:30,FoxxTrotter,BRB.
30-11-2018T16:44:55,Vatruvius,"That excitement causes your immune system to attack itself, I have been a victim of this."
30-11-2018T16:45:22,SageSaga,except most have no or only traces of Mercury
30-11-2018T16:46:10,Vatruvius,"Even with low to no amounts of mercury, the aluminum is that larger problem now."
30-11-2018T16:46:24,Dadrobit,"A vaccine containing 0.01% thimerosal as a preservative contains 50 micrograms of thimerosal per 0.5 mL dose or approximately 25 micrograms of mercury per 0.5 mL dose. For comparison, this is roughly the same amount of elemental mercury contained in a 3"
30-11-2018T16:46:32,Dadrobit,ounce can of tuna fish
30-11-2018T16:46:53,Vatruvius,I wouldn't eat Tuna...
30-11-2018T16:46:58,SageSaga,wow
30-11-2018T16:47:02,Dadrobit,"Furthermore, thimerosal is being used less and less in vaccines in recent years"
30-11-2018T16:47:19,Vatruvius,Not from non-discriptive sellers.
30-11-2018T16:47:40,ThingsAreMoving,every ocenic fish has loads of mercury in it's meat
30-11-2018T16:48:02,ThingsAreMoving,if you eat any tuna at all you ingest more mercury that you would get from a vaccine
30-11-2018T16:48:04,Vatruvius,"Didn't use to, those levels are rising due to what we are doing to our oceans Things."
30-11-2018T16:48:11,sunblaze,hiya everyone
30-11-2018T16:48:18,SageSaga,hey Sunblaze
30-11-2018T16:48:23,Vatruvius,Hello sunblaze
30-11-2018T16:48:48,ThingsAreMoving,also your response to aluminum in a vaccine proves my point that vaccines amount/strength aren't adjusted for individuals
30-11-2018T16:49:06,ThingsAreMoving,which doesn't mean they shouldn't be administered
30-11-2018T16:49:20,ThingsAreMoving,but rather they should be adjusted accordingly
30-11-2018T16:49:29,ThingsAreMoving,also o/ sunblaze
30-11-2018T16:49:51,Dadrobit,o/ Sun
30-11-2018T16:49:59,Vatruvius,"I believe in the concept of vaccines and what they are trying to do, but we need to find safer alternatives to how we are preserving these vaccines and how we are exciting a response from the immune system."
30-11-2018T16:50:07,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, Sunblaze and Dadrobit."
30-11-2018T16:50:16,SageSaga,"it's just a scummy thing to say ""Im not anti-vaxer, I just think vaccines should be safe for our children"""
30-11-2018T16:50:56,Vatruvius,"I don't think they should be safe just for our children, but to each their own views."
30-11-2018T16:51:11,ThingsAreMoving,"While I sort of agree with you, Vat I don;t think we're at this kind of level technology-wise to adapt vaccine shots to every individual"
30-11-2018T16:51:15,sunblaze,they are? unless the doc botches up of course. but the vaccs itself are
30-11-2018T16:51:23,Vatruvius,"Vaccines have done a lot of good, but changes need to happen over time."
30-11-2018T16:51:36,SageSaga,im saying that is an anti-vaxer talking point- they shy away from the fact they dont like them and try to make it about not knowing if they are actually safe
30-11-2018T16:52:23,SageSaga,even though all the research says they are and they have reduced the use of possibly harmful materials in them since they were originally used
30-11-2018T16:52:45,ThingsAreMoving,It's like people fighting the meat industry not realising the fact that the lag-grown meat is jsut a few years away and they already have an alternative.
30-11-2018T16:52:51,ThingsAreMoving,lab*
30-11-2018T16:53:00,Vatruvius,"I have not shying away from anything Sage, come another decade this stuff will become a problem and you will see it in every news source out there. To stereotype me into what the media calls individuals in the category is whole-fully wrong."
30-11-2018T16:53:02,Dadrobit,"The aluminum contained in vaccines is similar to that found in a liter of infant formula. While infants receive about 4.4 milligrams of aluminum in the first six months of life from vaccines, they receive more than that in their diet."
30-11-2018T16:53:16,Dadrobit,"Breast-fed infants ingest about 7 milligrams, formula-fed infants ingest about 38 milligrams, and infants who are fed soy formula ingest almost 117 milligrams of aluminum during the first six months of life."
30-11-2018T16:53:44,Vatruvius,"You now, all the research showed that leaded gasoline was safe for humans until two decades later and the death of a scientist against leaded gasoline."
30-11-2018T16:53:48,ThingsAreMoving,Dad with the google-fu
30-11-2018T16:54:00,Dadrobit,Whah Chah!
30-11-2018T16:54:46,Vatruvius,"It is not just the elemental aluminum Dadro, it is a very specific compound used to excite an immune response based off of aluminum."
30-11-2018T16:54:51,SageSaga,i think that's called cherry picking data
30-11-2018T16:55:06,ThingsAreMoving,"Well yeah, the research is usually sponsored by lobbying companies, like when bayer was sponsoring doctors using heroin as a drug that was helping get rid of cocaine addiction, lol"
30-11-2018T16:55:27,sunblaze,that and what is the alternative currently? getting sick and spreading epidemics? hardly
30-11-2018T16:55:27,Bgrmystr2,lol did they then get addicted to heroin instead?
30-11-2018T16:55:31,Kullax,P hacking is a thing. Also hello~
30-11-2018T16:55:31,Bgrmystr2,cuz that's any better..
30-11-2018T16:55:36,Vatruvius,"It is, and was used legally to influence the public into thinking leaded gasoline was sage. Leaded paint, lead treated food cans, etc."
30-11-2018T16:55:41,ThingsAreMoving,but that doesn't change the fact that statistically most poeople are fine and benefit from being vaccinated
30-11-2018T16:56:00,ThingsAreMoving,"yerp bgr, those were wacky times"
30-11-2018T16:56:05,sunblaze,sure one day better cheaper alternatives might be found possible. but right now none exist and saying no simply is stupid
30-11-2018T16:56:06,Vatruvius,sage*
30-11-2018T16:56:10,Vatruvius,safe*
30-11-2018T16:56:11,FoxxTrotter,"E'lo, Kullax."
30-11-2018T16:56:12,Vatruvius,god
30-11-2018T16:56:26,Kullax,Hi FoxxTrotter :)
30-11-2018T16:56:31,ThingsAreMoving,o/ Kull
30-11-2018T16:56:40,Vatruvius,Anyway...
30-11-2018T16:56:57,Vatruvius,I would prefer to just move on.
30-11-2018T16:57:26,SageSaga,but i am le concerned
30-11-2018T16:57:44,Vatruvius,Concerned for what?
30-11-2018T16:57:50,SageSaga,for you
30-11-2018T16:57:53,Kullax,Everyone ready for December? Christmas and all?
30-11-2018T16:58:19,sunblaze,Î changey my wallpaper to a sexy christmas-elf. does that count?
30-11-2018T16:58:20,SageSaga,"you say you love science, but disagree with it because it could be wrong-"
30-11-2018T16:58:27,Vatruvius,"Well, I am the one who has not needed a doctor visit in 6 years"
30-11-2018T16:58:47,SageSaga,that is not evidence you know?
30-11-2018T16:58:48,Vatruvius,"I do not disagree with science, most of that ""proof"" you refer to has been lobbied for."
30-11-2018T16:58:52,Dadrobit,And I would prefer that society going forward wasn't stymied by people ignorantly and/or negligently lobbying for the resurgence of deadly illnesses just because they don't like the periodic table.
30-11-2018T16:58:56,Dadrobit,But here we are.
30-11-2018T16:59:10,SageSaga,you have an anecdote - not a fact
30-11-2018T16:59:48,Kullax,I should find myself a xmas desktop. Good idea :3
30-11-2018T17:00:20,Vatruvius,"The research involved is long, arduous, and not easy to get a hold of because vaccine companies do not want this information out there. Believe what you want Sage, I will do what I think is best for myself and my family."
30-11-2018T17:00:32,Bgrmystr2,"at this point dadro, I'm of the opinion that both sides might just be trying to kill each other without the other knowing"
30-11-2018T17:00:40,Vatruvius,"I agree Kullax, nothing like a nice computer."
30-11-2018T17:00:42,Bgrmystr2,and I just kinda chill in my corner away from everything.
30-11-2018T17:01:17,SageSaga,so you are an anti-vaxer
30-11-2018T17:02:11,Dadrobit,I was having such a good day too...
30-11-2018T17:02:17,ThingsAreMoving,"Thing is, people vaccinating themselves pose no risk to people who don't, whereas the other way around if people not vaccinated get a certain disease there's a high chance that disease is gonna mutate and be harmful to vaccinated people."
30-11-2018T17:03:10,Vatruvius,There is an even higher chance that diseases mutate in animals before the reach humans. Something there is no vaccine for until it starts infecting people.
30-11-2018T17:03:43,Kullax,Omg that's how zombie movies start! We doomed!
30-11-2018T17:03:46,sunblaze,so you give up since one day humanity is doomed?
30-11-2018T17:03:47,ThingsAreMoving,there's something called human/animal barrier which is veeeery rarely crossed
30-11-2018T17:04:26,ThingsAreMoving,"unless there are some horny people and defenseless, diseased animals"
30-11-2018T17:04:46,ThingsAreMoving,then may god have mercy on our souls
30-11-2018T17:04:56,sunblaze,^.......... :ptv-grossedout:
30-11-2018T17:05:04,SageSaga,that's not how that usually happens ThingsAreMoving
30-11-2018T17:05:38,ThingsAreMoving,"I'll trust ye, Sage."
30-11-2018T17:06:01,SageSaga,that whole thing about Aids coming from monkeys because some crazy guy had sex with one is false
30-11-2018T17:06:34,sunblaze,^and racist
30-11-2018T17:06:56,Xexanoth,didn't they eat them?
30-11-2018T17:07:14,Xexanoth,same as mad cow
30-11-2018T17:07:17,ThingsAreMoving,"Ikr, doesn't change the fact that diseases that originate in animals very rarely mutate in a way that let's them infect humans"
30-11-2018T17:07:40,SageSaga,yeah they do very very rarely hop to another species
30-11-2018T17:08:06,SageSaga,however they commonly hop from human to human - again - Herd Immunity
30-11-2018T17:08:16,ThingsAreMoving,"And usually by the time they do, we know about them cause they leave dead animals in their wake"
30-11-2018T17:09:40,Vatruvius,Well I am got to go hang out with some friends. See you all later.
30-11-2018T17:09:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"When someone can give me solid hardcore proof of the legitimacy of anti vaccinations, with legitimate sources from impartial bodies, I may consider it"
30-11-2018T17:09:59,ThingsAreMoving,"have fun, Vat"
30-11-2018T17:10:00,SageSaga,take care Vat
30-11-2018T17:10:07,Dadrobit,"Good luck, Vat."
30-11-2018T17:10:09,SageSaga,sorry we ganged up on ya- just worried
30-11-2018T17:10:16,Dadrobit,"Aye, with Sage."
30-11-2018T17:10:18,ThingsAreMoving,we still <3 ya
30-11-2018T17:10:20,SageSaga,stay healthy
30-11-2018T17:10:24,FoxxTrotter,"C-ya, Vat."
30-11-2018T17:10:54,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, the same could be said the other way, kiwi"
30-11-2018T17:11:09,SpazztasticKiwi,The world today is proof vaccines work
30-11-2018T17:11:10,ThingsAreMoving,"yeah, no"
30-11-2018T17:11:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Chicken pox and measles are resurfaced because of it
30-11-2018T17:11:48,SpazztasticKiwi,But I don’t particularly care what another believes
30-11-2018T17:11:50,ThingsAreMoving,there's tons of evidence that vaccines caused people to not die of diseases they're vaccinated to
30-11-2018T17:12:30,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s the idea of having your own opinion. Just don’t try to convince me you’re better for your opinion
30-11-2018T17:12:47,Bgrmystr2,just cuz both sides ignore lots of things doesn't mean one side is blatantly wrong all the time. That's just tunnelvision
30-11-2018T17:13:00,SpazztasticKiwi,When was that covered
30-11-2018T17:13:20,ThingsAreMoving,bgr thing is one side stays healthy and doesn't pose any risk to the other side
30-11-2018T17:13:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Vaccines have risks yes but the proof of their hand in wiping out a few diseases are visible today
30-11-2018T17:13:45,ThingsAreMoving,whereas the other side by not acknowledging the benefits of vaccinations pose risk to the vaccinated side just by existing
30-11-2018T17:13:55,Bgrmystr2,"You know Engineered diseases are a thing, right? lol"
30-11-2018T17:14:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Those aren’t in question
30-11-2018T17:14:14,Bgrmystr2,and there's the problem imo xD
30-11-2018T17:14:16,ThingsAreMoving,"I know, we're not covering this in current discussion"
30-11-2018T17:15:06,ThingsAreMoving,Bgr you can make a supervirus in your attic if you really want to
30-11-2018T17:15:18,Bgrmystr2,yup you can
30-11-2018T17:15:27,SageSaga,"i just hate how weaselly some people can be about it - they say stuff like ""Oh i believe in medicine and science, I just also KNOW that big pharma and science is paid for by people that want you to buy their science juice!"""
30-11-2018T17:15:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"Engineering diseases is rather stupid but if they want to make them, don’t they generally make a cure right along side it to prevent issues"
30-11-2018T17:15:40,SpazztasticKiwi,?
30-11-2018T17:15:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"Like, terrible example but Resident Evil"
30-11-2018T17:15:59,SageSaga,Spaz- when they can -
30-11-2018T17:16:02,Bgrmystr2,"not if it's malicious, kiwi"
30-11-2018T17:16:04,sunblaze,^not if its meant for war
30-11-2018T17:16:14,Bgrmystr2,or what sun said
30-11-2018T17:16:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Wasn’t the t virus for wat
30-11-2018T17:16:17,SpazztasticKiwi,war
30-11-2018T17:16:22,SageSaga,uhh no most made for war also have a cure
30-11-2018T17:16:33,SpazztasticKiwi,In the best cases
30-11-2018T17:16:39,SageSaga,because if someone got it and used it on you they want to be able to fix it
30-11-2018T17:16:43,sunblaze,well yes but not distributed to everyone since that defeats its purpose
30-11-2018T17:16:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Otherwise that’s not a good scientist
30-11-2018T17:17:04,Xexanoth,"to be fair, all the people saying stuff like ""science and pharma is paid for have never dealt with pharma and science and don't know what a massive dick measuring contest those fields are"
30-11-2018T17:17:07,Bgrmystr2,people who make superviruses aren't good scientists.
30-11-2018T17:17:09,sunblaze,which means you have a disease YOU are safe from but you are not safe from thuse mutated strains you made possible
30-11-2018T17:17:15,SageSaga,rumors are they have made some stuff that has no way to cure it and it is only allowed a few samples to exist for research purposes
30-11-2018T17:17:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean made alongside the virus or whatever it is so it can prevent or help stop an outbreak if there was an accident
30-11-2018T17:17:37,sunblaze,yes we have a lab like that 2 hours away from here true
30-11-2018T17:17:42,ThingsAreMoving,viral warfare is too big of a hazard just cause viruses can mutate unpredictably and the cure for them can be useless after a while
30-11-2018T17:18:02,Xexanoth,terrorist won't care about that
30-11-2018T17:18:06,Xexanoth,that's the problem
30-11-2018T17:18:13,ThingsAreMoving,It's more of a 'reset the world' button
30-11-2018T17:18:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Reminds me of a sign I once saw: Nuclear Plant (and below it) Spider Farm
30-11-2018T17:18:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Both pointing in the same direction
30-11-2018T17:18:43,Bgrmystr2,lol reset the world to nature
30-11-2018T17:18:44,ThingsAreMoving,"lol, spiderman factory"
30-11-2018T17:18:45,Xexanoth,how else are you gonna make spider man
30-11-2018T17:18:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I smell a movie
30-11-2018T17:19:28,SageSaga,"See ""The Division"" for more information"
30-11-2018T17:19:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I believe there’s already a Radioactive Spiders movie on SyFy though
30-11-2018T17:19:41,ThingsAreMoving,"yerah, bgr that's what it boils down to, even the climate change isn't going to kill the planet. It's only going to kill some percentage of life on the planet"
30-11-2018T17:19:45,ThingsAreMoving,the rest will adjust
30-11-2018T17:20:00,Bgrmystr2,"haha that's a whole nother topic, things xD"
30-11-2018T17:20:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Some stuff is just so hard to predict!
30-11-2018T17:20:14,SageSaga,there is a great comic about that
30-11-2018T17:20:30,Xexanoth,"i mean, humans already killed a lot of percent of animals"
30-11-2018T17:20:48,SpazztasticKiwi,“Oops”
30-11-2018T17:20:50,SageSaga,"theres a guy talking to mother earth and hes crying and saying ""Im so sorry we destroyed the planet!"" and mother nature says-"
30-11-2018T17:21:07,ThingsAreMoving,"I've seen it, Sage"
30-11-2018T17:21:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Like the Tasmanian wolf died in about 19 something
30-11-2018T17:21:15,ThingsAreMoving,made me lol
30-11-2018T17:21:25,SageSaga,"""Oh dear *hugs* you didnt destroy the planet! you just made it unlivable for humans! We'll be fine without you"""
30-11-2018T17:21:42,ThingsAreMoving,"""You're royally fucked and won't be missed"""
30-11-2018T17:21:44,ThingsAreMoving,xD
30-11-2018T17:22:26,Bgrmystr2,"yeah that really only solidifies that we can easily kill ourselves, but affecting the planet as a whole is nigh impossible for us"
30-11-2018T17:22:28,sunblaze,btw god sage how did you lean to draw that glorious elven-asses
30-11-2018T17:22:40,ThingsAreMoving,"https://www.deviantart.com/humon/art/Mother-Gaia-207388674 this, Sage?"
30-11-2018T17:22:49,sunblaze,is is a gift? pure dedication? or just a devils pact?
30-11-2018T17:22:51,Bgrmystr2,aaaaaa link etc
30-11-2018T17:22:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a feeling they really are gonna end up just putting us all in space
30-11-2018T17:24:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I like that Mother Nature
30-11-2018T17:24:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I gotta go back in. Lunch’ll be soon though
30-11-2018T17:24:30,SageSaga,i'll allow it because i was gonna post it anyways
30-11-2018T17:24:37,ThingsAreMoving,<3
30-11-2018T17:24:46,sunblaze,sneaky link :D
30-11-2018T17:25:02,SpazztasticKiwi,A “slink”?
30-11-2018T17:25:20,SageSaga,Sunblaze- i learned it by observing them in their natural habitat
30-11-2018T17:25:28,sunblaze,hehe :P
30-11-2018T17:25:35,SpazztasticKiwi,✌🏻
30-11-2018T17:25:54,ThingsAreMoving,"Wait, so what are the rules for links, cause I'm a bit confused now. No link when there's a multi-stream, or only when you;re online, Sage?"
30-11-2018T17:26:15,sunblaze,ask him if you can link something and he will decide easy
30-11-2018T17:26:21,SageSaga,when im streaming you must ask permission and say what you would like to link
30-11-2018T17:26:48,Bgrmystr2,"how are you just now confused things, you've been here for more than a year right"
30-11-2018T17:27:07,Kullax,May I post a rickroll pretending it's a cute elven butt?
30-11-2018T17:27:14,ThingsAreMoving,I've never linked anything when Sage was streaming
30-11-2018T17:27:20,sunblaze,^:ptv-excited:
30-11-2018T17:27:23,ThingsAreMoving,I'm usually only here on sundays
30-11-2018T17:27:25,Bgrmystr2,so? Most people don't.
30-11-2018T17:27:31,ThingsAreMoving,so I don't know the rules
30-11-2018T17:27:43,Bgrmystr2,do you never appear on friday? Ever?
30-11-2018T17:27:45,Bgrmystr2,XD
30-11-2018T17:27:46,ThingsAreMoving,noep
30-11-2018T17:27:51,sunblaze,its just below the streamwindow rule 1 :D
30-11-2018T17:27:52,Bgrmystr2,"bruh, lurk more"
30-11-2018T17:28:17,ThingsAreMoving,bgr friday streams start at 2am my time
30-11-2018T17:28:33,SageSaga,its very easy for mods and myself to quickly see and delete links- which is safer than letting people post whatever- check it - and then delete it
30-11-2018T17:28:36,Bgrmystr2,I'd go to em.
30-11-2018T17:28:41,ThingsAreMoving,"that's too late for me to watch them, unfortunately"
30-11-2018T17:28:57,Bgrmystr2,you should fix that so you can go to them
30-11-2018T17:28:59,SageSaga,we dont allow Adult content to be posted and or malicious links
30-11-2018T17:29:17,ThingsAreMoving,"So whispering you, or a mod is the way to go?"
30-11-2018T17:29:19,SageSaga,the rule exists because we did have someone linking to a virus before
30-11-2018T17:29:23,Dadrobit,"Okay, had a snack, back now."
30-11-2018T17:29:24,ThingsAreMoving,cause Tom has whispers blocked
30-11-2018T17:29:35,Dadrobit,Link rules talk?
30-11-2018T17:29:38,SageSaga,you can whisper me but you can also ask in chat
30-11-2018T17:29:38,ThingsAreMoving,yep
30-11-2018T17:30:09,SageSaga,oh and posting from our official pages is fine too
30-11-2018T17:30:16,ThingsAreMoving,"alright, will do. In other words abide to the netiquette and all will be fine"
30-11-2018T17:30:16,Dadrobit,Permission to link a picture of a badass Mad Max kart some kids made at my father's welding competition today?
30-11-2018T17:30:36,SageSaga,go for it Dadrobit
30-11-2018T17:30:42,Dadrobit,Wheeeeee! https://i.imgur.com/WpdNIpw.jpg
30-11-2018T17:31:01,ThingsAreMoving,nice
30-11-2018T17:31:07,ThingsAreMoving,needs a flamethrower though
30-11-2018T17:31:13,sunblaze,neecs fire and a guitarr :D
30-11-2018T17:31:14,SageSaga,needs a guy playing a guitar on the front too
30-11-2018T17:31:17,sunblaze,but yet wicked cool!
30-11-2018T17:31:22,Dadrobit,"It was an interstate competition, kids had a few weeks to blueprint a kart, then they had 10-ish ours to actually build it."
30-11-2018T17:31:29,Dadrobit,hours*
30-11-2018T17:31:32,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, looks kinda just like a gokart as just a frame without the engine."
30-11-2018T17:31:34,Bgrmystr2,imo\
30-11-2018T17:31:41,ThingsAreMoving,"wow, for a 10hrs project it's awesome"
30-11-2018T17:31:53,Dadrobit,Engine is hidden by the seat.
30-11-2018T17:32:01,SageSaga,Bgr is a dick to kids
30-11-2018T17:32:12,ThingsAreMoving,that's illegal afaik
30-11-2018T17:32:16,Bgrmystr2,lol where do you get that from sage
30-11-2018T17:32:23,Xexanoth,"that's ""dicking kids"" things"
30-11-2018T17:32:57,ThingsAreMoving,"well dang, there goes my attempt at humor"
30-11-2018T17:33:01,SageSaga,"""This kid helped build this cart"" Bgr - ""Hey kid! Your trash vehicle looks like just a gokart frame without an engine! loser!"""
30-11-2018T17:33:05,Dadrobit,"This kart actually had a major malfunction at the starting line with the gas pedal, so they tied the throttle cable to a wrench and she just pulled on it with her right hand for throttle."
30-11-2018T17:33:31,Bgrmystr2,"lol please, sage, like you can really infer that from what I said."
30-11-2018T17:33:38,sunblaze,neat thats the suff dreams are made off!
30-11-2018T17:33:39,Dadrobit,It was a kickass mod tbh.
30-11-2018T17:33:54,SageSaga,how else do you read that?
30-11-2018T17:34:37,Bgrmystr2,like anyone else? By not reading it with the intent of head-up-ass? Which I don't do?
30-11-2018T17:34:40,Dadrobit,"Oh, and the fact that the team all painted their mouths chrome and shouted about riding eternal really sold it."
30-11-2018T17:34:57,sunblaze,no fiery guitarrs?
30-11-2018T17:35:11,sunblaze,well second best of world then :D
30-11-2018T17:35:13,Dadrobit,Not enough time. But they were witnessed  nonetheless.
30-11-2018T17:35:23,Bgrmystr2,"I don't think people as losers, and making karts is still cool, I'm just noting what it looks like to me."
30-11-2018T17:35:54,Dadrobit,"There was one flamethrower I suppose, but it was on the back of our own Mad Max vehicle at the car show on the other end of the parking lot."
30-11-2018T17:36:12,SageSaga,am i the only one that thought bgr was kinda mean about the kids mod by saying it just looks like a frame?
30-11-2018T17:36:24,Dadrobit,"No, I saw it too."
30-11-2018T17:36:35,sunblaze,awww do not do serious conclusive reasoning with kids bgr
30-11-2018T17:36:48,sunblaze,praise then as almost perfect and next time it will get MORE kickass!
30-11-2018T17:37:00,Bgrmystr2,"Don't yell at me, sun, I didn't mean anything by it. Everyone's being all defensive for nothing."
30-11-2018T17:37:18,Bgrmystr2,Sorry I'm not impressed by something so obviously amazing that I can't fathom for some reason? lol
30-11-2018T17:37:23,sunblaze,"you call a ""more"" a yell? that"
30-11-2018T17:37:25,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-confused:
30-11-2018T17:37:27,Xexanoth,i'm with bgr on this one
30-11-2018T17:37:32,sunblaze,is kinda strange :D
30-11-2018T17:37:36,Dadrobit,At least their kart made it. A few did not unfortunately.
30-11-2018T17:37:49,SageSaga,im just trying to see if i was the only one that felt that was how ya meant it-
30-11-2018T17:38:24,Bgrmystr2,"If I meant it like that, it would have been worded very differently lol"
30-11-2018T17:38:26,Dadrobit,One team got their tires from Harbor Freight. Only made it halfway through the course when the front end collapsed.
30-11-2018T17:38:58,sunblaze,see it that way bgr yes after the links discription I thought of tomething differenet too. but is still was a huge and excellent work they did. so praise is still well deserved despite not 10% reacing my expectations
30-11-2018T17:39:11,sunblaze,100%
30-11-2018T17:39:23,ThingsAreMoving,"were they driving around CAC, Dad?"
30-11-2018T17:39:42,Dadrobit,CAC?
30-11-2018T17:39:56,ThingsAreMoving,Central Arizona College
30-11-2018T17:40:10,Dadrobit,"Ahhh, no. This was at a high school."
30-11-2018T17:40:40,ThingsAreMoving,looks like there isn't any decent track around that's why I was curious
30-11-2018T17:42:20,Dadrobit,"The track they set up went around the back side of the football stadium with a bunch of speed-bumps and obstacles, over a ramp, into a 1/4 mile straightaway, into a pitstop, then reverse the course with a slightly different pathing through the obstacles."
30-11-2018T17:42:50,ThingsAreMoving,banana peels included?
30-11-2018T17:42:54,sunblaze,how many vehicles did compete?
30-11-2018T17:43:05,Dadrobit,"Nah, no bananna peels."
30-11-2018T17:43:19,Bgrmystr2,oh good
30-11-2018T17:43:22,Bgrmystr2,those are super dangerous
30-11-2018T17:43:27,Dadrobit,I want to say 16 teams from around the state and some nearby states.
30-11-2018T17:43:35,ThingsAreMoving,safety at 100%
30-11-2018T17:44:09,sunblaze,oh sounds like a good event then. nice!
30-11-2018T17:44:26,Dadrobit,Pops also got a bunch of welding and fabrication vendors to sponsor it. Got an underwater welding company to bring out a dive tank to put on demonstrations which was pretty cool.
30-11-2018T17:45:54,Dadrobit,Permission to link a picture of one of the teams that didn't quite make the whole track?
30-11-2018T17:46:42,Bgrmystr2,I'm game
30-11-2018T17:47:03,Dadrobit,Ended up needing the rest of the team to manually push it across the finish line.
30-11-2018T17:47:24,sunblaze,awww well at least they tried
30-11-2018T17:47:52,Dadrobit,Drivetrain snapped on the ramp.
30-11-2018T17:48:03,sunblaze,hmm might nee a second. sage is distrated with catgirls :D
30-11-2018T17:48:32,SageSaga,go for it Dadrobit
30-11-2018T17:48:52,Dadrobit,The speedbumps and the ramp really caused problems for teams that didn't design their own suspension systems.
30-11-2018T17:49:03,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/HxjY8IY.jpg
30-11-2018T17:50:10,Bgrmystr2,do they have to push it across the finish line with the person inside?
30-11-2018T17:50:12,sunblaze,I like their tires and the huge rolling bar
30-11-2018T17:50:21,sunblaze,but sure good one as well
30-11-2018T17:51:14,Dadrobit,"These kids pushed it to the pitstop, then pushed it around the emergency exit portion of the track that brings them right back to the start, so they didn't complete the whole track."
30-11-2018T17:51:27,ThingsAreMoving,I see no suspension system there. speed bumps must've hurt as hell
30-11-2018T17:51:31,SageSaga,did yall see that Japanese relay runner that broke her leg while running so she crawled all the way to the next runner instead of letting the medics take her away?
30-11-2018T17:51:41,Dadrobit,oof
30-11-2018T17:51:41,ThingsAreMoving,I saw that
30-11-2018T17:51:44,Dadrobit,shudders
30-11-2018T17:51:59,ThingsAreMoving,10/10 would bow in respect
30-11-2018T17:52:09,sunblaze,ouch sounds as hardcore as painful
30-11-2018T17:52:11,Bgrmystr2,"haven't heard of it, but god damn"
30-11-2018T17:52:14,Bgrmystr2,dedication
30-11-2018T17:52:20,Bgrmystr2,not.. sure if worth
30-11-2018T17:52:33,sunblaze,would bow as well
30-11-2018T17:53:04,Dadrobit,"And yeah, the teams with no suspension really learned today. The *KA-KLUNK* sounds they made as they traversed the bumps could be heard across the campus."
30-11-2018T17:53:21,sunblaze,:ptv-confused:
30-11-2018T17:54:06,ThingsAreMoving,"Japanese have different value system. I've heard a story that someone from europe visited a friend in japan, and they went for a beer or something and the japanese forced them to halt at a crossing just cause there was a red light. No cars or bikes"
30-11-2018T17:54:17,FoxxTrotter,"BRB, dinner is ready. :0)"
30-11-2018T17:54:21,Dadrobit,Enjoy
30-11-2018T17:54:26,ThingsAreMoving,"in sight, and when the european asked why are they abiding to the laws"
30-11-2018T17:54:45,ThingsAreMoving,the japanese said 'cause some kid might see us and it'll influence them'
30-11-2018T17:54:46,sunblaze,you stop at a red light in europe as well so no competition. no amtter is someone is around or not
30-11-2018T17:54:51,sunblaze,still a traffic violation
30-11-2018T17:54:54,Bgrmystr2,well yeah you're supposed to do that here in the US as well
30-11-2018T17:55:11,SageSaga,"""Err uhm- sorry- in my country Red means go... yeaaaah"""
30-11-2018T17:55:15,Bgrmystr2,just cuz noone listens to it doesn't mean it's not there for a reason lol
30-11-2018T17:55:48,ThingsAreMoving,"erm, if there's a red light and there's no vehicle in sight you can cross the street at your own risk, at least in the uk"
30-11-2018T17:55:57,ThingsAreMoving,"safety first, rules second"
30-11-2018T17:56:00,sunblaze,certainly not in germany
30-11-2018T17:56:22,sunblaze,the only ones who are agle to do it on their own risk are emergency services
30-11-2018T17:56:22,Bgrmystr2,"I can understand the confusion, but you go to another country, you should expect different rules and shouldn't be surprised at it."
30-11-2018T17:56:39,Bgrmystr2,"same here, sun"
30-11-2018T17:56:50,Dadrobit,You can turn right on red and pull a u-turn on red so long as you stop first and their is no traffic in AZ unless the intersection specifies otherwise.
30-11-2018T17:57:05,ThingsAreMoving,"Yeah, but normally you don't cross the street cause you fear a fine, or a ticket or however you call it"
30-11-2018T17:57:06,Dadrobit,"Otherwise, red means no-go."
30-11-2018T17:57:14,Bgrmystr2,"isn't that widespread though, Dadro?"
30-11-2018T17:57:15,ThingsAreMoving,whereas in the story it' more about giving an example
30-11-2018T17:57:25,Dadrobit,"Nah, not everywhere."
30-11-2018T17:57:25,ThingsAreMoving,even if noone is looking
30-11-2018T17:57:28,Bgrmystr2,"unless there's signs that say ""no right"" or ""no uturn"""
30-11-2018T17:58:05,Bgrmystr2,I haven't heard of any states where it's not allowed across the board
30-11-2018T17:58:19,Dadrobit,"Done some cross country road trips, and some states make a big deal out of red meaning ""don't fucking move"""
30-11-2018T17:58:42,Dadrobit,Dunno if it's changed in recent years. S'been a few years.
30-11-2018T17:59:02,Bgrmystr2,"there's prolly a few, but I doubt it's many"
30-11-2018T18:02:19,FoxxTrotter,"There is a traffic light in Syracuse which has the lights inverted. It's in an Irish neighborhood, and an Irish thing."
30-11-2018T18:02:40,FoxxTrotter,"Green on top, red on the bottom."
30-11-2018T18:04:24,FoxxTrotter,They don't want British red sitting on top of Irish green.
30-11-2018T18:04:37,sunblaze,on purpose or was someone just unable and bolted it the wong way?
30-11-2018T18:04:43,sunblaze,you are kidding right?
30-11-2018T18:04:55,FoxxTrotter,Nope. I'll PM you a link.
30-11-2018T18:05:14,Bgrmystr2,the color red isn't british. They don't own the color.
30-11-2018T18:05:24,FoxxTrotter,Redcoats.
30-11-2018T18:05:46,ThingsAreMoving,I'd consider red a communist color if related to anything.
30-11-2018T18:05:53,Bgrmystr2,So? US has red. Russia has red.
30-11-2018T18:06:05,Bgrmystr2,and yeah I'd think USSR as red before any other country
30-11-2018T18:06:13,Bgrmystr2,but even they don't own red. lol
30-11-2018T18:06:16,FoxxTrotter,This goes back before all that.
30-11-2018T18:06:33,sunblaze,that is still stupid
30-11-2018T18:06:37,ThingsAreMoving,Traffic signs before USSR ?
30-11-2018T18:06:42,Bgrmystr2,hahahaha
30-11-2018T18:06:49,sunblaze,safety should be waaay above and political idea
30-11-2018T18:06:55,Bgrmystr2,"That's my thoughts, things"
30-11-2018T18:07:06,ThingsAreMoving,:raised_hand:
30-11-2018T18:07:23,FoxxTrotter,"No...like Sunblaze said, it's a political thing."
30-11-2018T18:07:28,Bgrmystr2,:pray: high5 lol
30-11-2018T18:07:53,ThingsAreMoving,"lol, hi5ing yourself"
30-11-2018T18:07:55,ThingsAreMoving,lame
30-11-2018T18:08:06,Bgrmystr2,you're the one that held up your hand for it
30-11-2018T18:08:08,Bgrmystr2,you let me down
30-11-2018T18:08:09,FoxxTrotter,I still like the dummy traffic lights up in New York. They are on a pedestal in the middle of an intersection.
30-11-2018T18:08:16,Bgrmystr2,"I am disappointed in you, things."
30-11-2018T18:08:24,SageSaga,all done- i will probably go back and redraw the first panel again
30-11-2018T18:08:26,ThingsAreMoving,:ptv-sad: ...sorry
30-11-2018T18:08:45,Bgrmystr2,sneakysnake in that last panel lol
30-11-2018T18:08:54,Bgrmystr2,needs a box.
30-11-2018T18:08:59,Bgrmystr2,they'd never see him in a box.
30-11-2018T18:09:00,Dadrobit,Just can't figure out that building huh?
30-11-2018T18:09:01,FoxxTrotter,"Of course, Picarto and their stupid sh*t of not loading streams."
30-11-2018T18:09:24,sunblaze,"moving box with a marking of ""nothing in this box"""
30-11-2018T18:09:27,FoxxTrotter,Looks great. :0)
30-11-2018T18:09:31,sunblaze,totally unseeable yeah!
30-11-2018T18:09:56,ThingsAreMoving,House looks like it needs some attention
30-11-2018T18:09:57,Bgrmystr2,"I'm wondering if that's a thing in the real world of the comic, something like MGS"
30-11-2018T18:10:08,Bgrmystr2,people hiding in boxes
30-11-2018T18:10:21,sunblaze,huh why?
30-11-2018T18:10:38,ThingsAreMoving,Hmm... is there any corrugated packaging factory in that comic?
30-11-2018T18:10:47,sunblaze,"they most certainly have chairs and full life support systems in ""RL"" why inside boxes?"
30-11-2018T18:10:55,ThingsAreMoving,If not then there's limited availability of boxes
30-11-2018T18:11:23,Bgrmystr2,"Sun, MGS is Metal Gear Solid, the whole.. assassin hiding in a box that noone thinks is suspicious for some reason"
30-11-2018T18:11:30,Bgrmystr2,I think you missed the joke
30-11-2018T18:11:30,ThingsAreMoving,also some kind of notification sounds in the background
30-11-2018T18:11:40,sunblaze,I certainly did yeah
30-11-2018T18:12:00,Bgrmystr2,"that's common, things"
30-11-2018T18:12:20,ThingsAreMoving,+1 knowledge
30-11-2018T18:12:58,Bgrmystr2,"I'm just sayin if they have something like metal gear in the real world of the comic, then Kaylin may know of stuff like people hiding in not-suspicious-at-all boxes"
30-11-2018T18:13:05,Bgrmystr2,so it wouldn't work.
30-11-2018T18:13:30,Bgrmystr2,the interaction would be great either way
30-11-2018T18:13:31,SageSaga,take care folks- darn houses and their weird perfectly shaped parts
30-11-2018T18:13:42,Dadrobit,o/ Sage
30-11-2018T18:13:43,FoxxTrotter,"Thanks for the stream, Sage."
30-11-2018T18:13:47,Bgrmystr2,maybe part of it could be collapsed?
30-11-2018T18:13:49,SageSaga,if houses had butts and boobs i wouldnt have this issue
30-11-2018T18:13:53,Bgrmystr2,LOL
30-11-2018T18:13:53,ThingsAreMoving,o/ Sage
30-11-2018T18:13:55,SageSaga,i'd have a whole other issue-
30-11-2018T18:13:59,ThingsAreMoving,build boobbutt house
30-11-2018T18:14:02,ThingsAreMoving,be a pioneer
30-11-2018T18:14:09,sunblaze,ohhh metaknowledge like yeah that I could see bgr
30-11-2018T18:14:53,sunblaze,and take care sage
30-11-2018T18:14:53,SageSaga,peace!
30-11-2018T18:15:06,Bgrmystr2,thanks for streamin sage :D
30-11-2018T18:15:11,ThingsAreMoving,One of  fantasy writers I read have employed a boob force field in his stories. It was pretty entertaining to read
30-11-2018T18:15:45,FoxxTrotter,"Later, everyone. :0)"
30-11-2018T18:15:48,sunblaze,and grav-forcefield to support tripple H?
30-11-2018T18:16:29,Bgrmystr2,"you don't need a forcefield to support them. At that tier, they have their own gravity"
30-11-2018T18:16:39,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
30-11-2018T18:16:58,sunblaze,fair point :D
30-11-2018T18:16:59,ThingsAreMoving,That was a force field dome with invisible boobs of various size on the inside
30-11-2018T18:17:29,ThingsAreMoving,quite useful for containing male population
30-11-2018T18:17:41,sunblaze,buuuut invisible?
30-11-2018T18:17:44,Bgrmystr2,"so if you stick your hand inside, it's kind of like reaching into Natani's chestwraps.."
30-11-2018T18:17:50,Bgrmystr2,never know what you'll get
30-11-2018T18:17:57,ThingsAreMoving,"I'd imagine so, bgr"
30-11-2018T18:17:58,Bgrmystr2,Natani? Keith? King?
30-11-2018T18:17:59,sunblaze,kinda defeats the purpose of boob oogling
30-11-2018T18:18:01,Bgrmystr2,who knows
30-11-2018T18:18:11,ThingsAreMoving,"No oogling, just feeling"

30-11-2018T18:20:05,sunblaze,well it works

30-11-2018T19:20:15,SpazztasticKiwi,But that means you don’t get the thing!
30-11-2018T19:20:37,Ordithus,"It shipped out 10/22, and still hadn't arrived.  Tracking said it wasn't even with USPS yet"
30-11-2018T19:20:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Any idea if that could be the case for anyone else?
30-11-2018T19:20:50,Ordithus,"Yeah, Kiwi, I didn't get the things."
30-11-2018T19:20:58,Ordithus,I'll make a new order for book 4
30-11-2018T19:21:28,Ordithus,But no signature print :ctwokinds-RaineEep:
30-11-2018T19:21:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I might email again. I still haven’t even gotten a ship date
30-11-2018T19:22:18,Dadrobit,"That sucks, send Tom an email about it and he might be able to hook you up maybe?"
30-11-2018T19:22:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh yeah
30-11-2018T19:22:57,unsteddyphoenix,Tom IS a nice guy like that
30-11-2018T19:23:09,SpazztasticKiwi,But didn’t he send all the signed prints back to KS after signing them
30-11-2018T19:23:50,Dadrobit,Might have something in cold storage to make up for it.
30-11-2018T19:23:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Yep
30-11-2018T19:24:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Stuck it in the fridge
30-11-2018T19:24:08,unsteddyphoenix,Perhaps a slightly defective version?
30-11-2018T19:24:12,Ordithus,"Worth a try, worst is he says no"
30-11-2018T19:24:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Safe keeping right there
30-11-2018T19:24:15,unsteddyphoenix,In cryogenic stasis

30-11-2018T19:25:13,Twokinds,Twokinds @ gmail

30-11-2018T19:42:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Sorta
30-11-2018T19:42:26,Twokinds,I just sent another package a few days ago and it cost a lot to ship a little 4lb box
30-11-2018T19:42:30,unsteddyphoenix,Yyyyeaaahh...
30-11-2018T19:42:46,unsteddyphoenix,Was it um...
30-11-2018T19:43:00,Ordithus,Now Tom knows where I live :ctwokinds-zenshocked:
30-11-2018T19:43:56,SpazztasticKiwi,And your name

30-11-2018T19:44:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Tide has turned in the football game and everyone having a come-apart
30-11-2018T19:44:49,unsteddyphoenix,Wait a second...
30-11-2018T19:44:49,Ordithus,":ctwokinds-floraquestion: wait, what?"

30-11-2018T19:45:04,SpazztasticKiwi,They’re playing the football game in the break room
30-11-2018T19:45:20,Twokinds,Now I just need your mother's maiden name and your high school mascot
30-11-2018T19:45:37,unsteddyphoenix,Highschools have mascots?
30-11-2018T19:45:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Unfortunately
30-11-2018T19:45:48,Twokinds,What yours don't?
30-11-2018T19:45:49,Ordithus,"Jokes on you, we didn't really have one."
30-11-2018T19:45:59,unsteddyphoenix,What was yours?
30-11-2018T19:46:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Pirates
30-11-2018T19:46:20,unsteddyphoenix,Thats...a pretty terrible mascot
30-11-2018T19:46:23,Twokinds,It wasn't very original. Eagles.
30-11-2018T19:46:30,unsteddyphoenix,"""My highschool mascot is a criminal"""
30-11-2018T19:46:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I still remember that stupid pep song
30-11-2018T19:46:35,unsteddyphoenix,How patriotic
30-11-2018T19:46:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Nothing like seeing black and gold freaking everywhere
30-11-2018T19:47:35,Ordithus,My highschool had a mascot a few years before I got to it.  Was outright stolen from the Minnesota Vikings.  Probably why it changed.
30-11-2018T19:48:03,SpazztasticKiwi,“Heeeey. That looks familiar”
30-11-2018T19:48:08,SpazztasticKiwi,“No it doesn’t.”
30-11-2018T19:48:38,unsteddyphoenix,Weird...
30-11-2018T19:48:46,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe Tom stole Nibbly from somewhere
30-11-2018T19:48:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Bad news
30-11-2018T19:48:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Gotta go
30-11-2018T19:49:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Lunch over
30-11-2018T19:49:07,Ordithus,"Bye Kiwi, take care"
30-11-2018T19:49:12,unsteddyphoenix,"Hey unlucky, seeyou later"
30-11-2018T19:49:53,Ordithus,Hmm I should fix dinner...
30-11-2018T19:50:59,unsteddyphoenix,"Thats a weird term. ""fix dinner"""
30-11-2018T19:51:14,unsteddyphoenix,"Ive never heard ""fix"" used that way for anything else."
30-11-2018T19:51:19,unsteddyphoenix,Whatcha gonn' eat?
30-11-2018T19:51:28,Twokinds,"Okay, book all packaged up and labeled. I'll have it in the mailbox Monday."
30-11-2018T19:51:44,Twokinds,Should arrive sometime next week.
30-11-2018T19:51:47,Ordithus,"Wow, that was fast!"
30-11-2018T19:51:52,unsteddyphoenix,:D
30-11-2018T19:51:56,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
30-11-2018T19:52:26,Dadrobit,"Back again. We were the coyotes. Nothing says ""get behind our school"" like having a roadkill scavenger as your mascot."
30-11-2018T19:52:49,unsteddyphoenix,Really...some odd choices goin on
30-11-2018T19:53:39,Dadrobit,Middle school was a Sidewinder Snake. So that was cool kinda.
30-11-2018T19:53:43,Twokinds,Cincinnati's football mascot is the Bengal Tigers
30-11-2018T19:54:26,Dadrobit,Elementary we had John Phillip Sousa as our mascot. Sousa.
30-11-2018T19:54:49,Twokinds,...
30-11-2018T19:55:05,unsteddyphoenix,Even as young as that
30-11-2018T19:55:11,unsteddyphoenix,How much school pride does one need
30-11-2018T19:55:15,Twokinds,The... composer?
30-11-2018T19:55:24,Dadrobit,"All of it and then some, unsteddy."
30-11-2018T19:55:46,Dadrobit,"Yeah, the composer. Had a sousaphone in the library to commemorate him."
30-11-2018T19:56:07,unsteddyphoenix,Did you have a John Phillip Sousa costume that someone put on?
30-11-2018T19:56:35,Dadrobit,"Nah, we didn't have organized inter-school sports. It was just kind of a commemorative thing."
30-11-2018T19:56:51,unsteddyphoenix,Extremely dissapointing
30-11-2018T19:57:34,Twokinds,"You know, I've always thought people mascots were weird."
30-11-2018T19:57:34,Dadrobit,"Eh, it got me into music. So it was kinda influential I suppose."
30-11-2018T20:03:01,Xexanoth,"man, schools having mascots is bizarre from the outside perspective, you guys do you i guess"
30-11-2018T20:06:35,unsteddyphoenix,Its an odd one
30-11-2018T20:09:33,Dadrobit,"School pride thing, tries to make going to school fun and interactive I suppose."
30-11-2018T20:11:27,Dadrobit,"Tried to build student collaboration and unity, like the students weren't just students, they were a ""pack"". And other schools ""feared the howl""."
30-11-2018T20:11:54,Bgrmystr2,"I'm a bit late, but you said mascot was a criminal?"
30-11-2018T20:12:04,Bgrmystr2,a smoothcriminal? :ptv-tease:
30-11-2018T20:12:36,Dadrobit,Maybe our school had too much pride though. Our rival school and ourselves had to have lots of police presence after one football game resulted in a riot.
30-11-2018T20:13:02,Bgrmystr2,jesus
30-11-2018T20:13:33,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha sounds fun
30-11-2018T20:13:40,unsteddyphoenix,Feared the howl lmao
30-11-2018T20:14:15,Dadrobit,It was a really good game though. Sophmore year. Homecoming game. Won the game in the final 8 seconds with a 54 yard kick. The visiting crowd were furious and stormed the field. It was great.
30-11-2018T20:14:36,Dadrobit,Ended up front page in the newspaper the next day.
30-11-2018T20:14:58,unsteddyphoenix,Oh THEY stormed the field
30-11-2018T20:15:00,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, then."
30-11-2018T20:15:14,Dadrobit,"Yeah, then our crowd met them."
30-11-2018T20:16:23,Dadrobit,"The teams went back to the lockers while the crowds duked it out in the field. I was in the band, we just kinda watched and played Eye of the Tiger."
30-11-2018T20:16:49,Ordithus,Haha
30-11-2018T20:17:36,Dadrobit,We got in some trouble for that one. But it was funny at the time.
30-11-2018T20:21:50,RimaDraws,home
30-11-2018T20:23:47,Dadrobit,":/ Can't find any videos of the riot after the football game, only one of the ones that happened after a basketball game."
30-11-2018T20:35:19,Bgrmystr2,aww
30-11-2018T20:35:35,Bgrmystr2,"eye of the tiger while ppl fighting on the field, that's gold though"
30-11-2018T20:38:10,RimaDraws,lol
30-11-2018T20:38:46,unsteddyphoenix,taht sounds amazing
30-11-2018T20:39:38,Dadrobit,"Yeah, we got a heckuva ""I'm disappointed in you"" speeches from the band director after that."
30-11-2018T20:40:30,Dadrobit,"Did feel kinda bad, he was a super amazing teacher. He was one of the ones who came out to the hospital to visit me when I broke my back the next year."
30-11-2018T20:40:35,Ordithus,"He says he is disappointed, but he is really oh so proud."
30-11-2018T20:41:47,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah deep down he's like ""Hell yeah go coyotes"""
30-11-2018T20:48:45,Dadrobit,"Nah, dude was crying when he reprimanded up about it. 99% sure it wasn't liquid pride."
30-11-2018T20:48:50,Dadrobit,us*
30-11-2018T20:49:49,Bgrmystr2,"lol, what was he most upset about?"
30-11-2018T20:51:26,Dadrobit,"That folks got legitimately hurt, our school reputation went to shit when police in riot gear had to break it up, and the smartases among the band started playing Eye of the Tiger when we should have been evacuating the stands."
30-11-2018T20:52:10,Dadrobit,It was super unprofessional of us.
30-11-2018T20:52:15,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, I probably wouldn't have joined, But I would have thought it was funny at the time."
30-11-2018T20:52:49,Bgrmystr2,really people fighting about school sports is dumb as balls anyway
30-11-2018T20:52:58,Bgrmystr2,"the fact that they did that should look bad on them, not on you"
30-11-2018T20:53:06,Bgrmystr2,because they're the ones that are idiots.
30-11-2018T20:53:21,Dadrobit,"They did it, but we goaded them on when we could have just walked away."
30-11-2018T20:56:26,Bgrmystr2,"just for that, I think I'm gonna go listen to that song"
30-11-2018T20:56:28,Bgrmystr2,cuz that's a good song.
30-11-2018T21:14:44,unsteddyphoenix,Idk. it still sounds funny
30-11-2018T21:16:35,Dadrobit,"I mean, yeah, I certainly look back and giggle still. But it does feel bad to disappoint a professor as much as we did."
