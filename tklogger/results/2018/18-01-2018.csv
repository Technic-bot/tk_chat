18-01-2018T21:08:54,BadFoMo,//Troll Rice.
18-01-2018T21:08:57,Bespin,HOW R U
18-01-2018T21:08:59,ZizzoGaming,There is a lot of debate surrounding that topic @Char89TheCharizard
18-01-2018T21:09:01,Bespin,caps
18-01-2018T21:09:04,ZizzoGaming,Hey Bespin
18-01-2018T21:09:14,Bespin,howdy
18-01-2018T21:09:36,TheDixieNutjob,Red's real name? It's Blue...
18-01-2018T21:09:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,its rar rar
18-01-2018T21:10:06,RedDeath2018,no it has somthing to do with a flower
18-01-2018T21:10:07,TheDixieNutjob,"he changed it to red when he entered the ""rebellious teenager"" years"
18-01-2018T21:10:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,that he's still in some what
18-01-2018T21:10:33,TheDixieNutjob,exactly
18-01-2018T21:10:35,Char89TheCharizard,"hmm, wonder what kind of flower name is also a boy's name"
18-01-2018T21:10:46,TheDixieNutjob,there isn't
18-01-2018T21:11:01,Bgrmystr2,"The reason why Red doesn't have a name is because he is supposed to be proof that a character doesn't need a name to actually be remembered. It's what they do, their personality"
18-01-2018T21:11:07,TheDixieNutjob,it could be like Mandark from Dexter's Lab and how his real name is Susan
18-01-2018T21:11:18,TheDixieNutjob,Red's real name could be a girl's name
18-01-2018T21:11:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I thought its because he just comic relief
18-01-2018T21:11:45,Bgrmystr2,Tom and sage explained it while back
18-01-2018T21:11:51,Bgrmystr2,it was a thing
18-01-2018T21:13:00,BadFoMo,@Bgrmystr2 I thought 'Stalker Girl' and the GTA3 Guy already proved that.
18-01-2018T21:13:08,ZizzoGaming,"Red's real name begins with either an R, B, or P. Someone began to say his name in an early page of the comic but got cut off"
18-01-2018T21:13:27,Bgrmystr2,"Fomo, that was something that Tom and Sage explained to the chat several streams back"
18-01-2018T21:13:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"so either red, belch or pansy"
18-01-2018T21:13:55,Bgrmystr2,there are no other main-ish characters that do not have a name
18-01-2018T21:13:58,ZizzoGaming,"I know we already have Lt. Reed, but I think it's Reed"

18-01-2018T21:48:44,CrRAR,not if you have smert brain!
18-01-2018T21:49:01,MetalAppleSauce,There's a difference between being the leader of a country because of popularity and being a leader because you killed the last one and are respected out of fear
18-01-2018T21:49:17,WarpedComics,"Okay, but the thibg is trace is not the leader anymore"

18-01-2018T22:45:33,Mihari,"The OK google one can be changed, Alexia can not."
18-01-2018T22:45:53,SageSaga,"cant Alexia be changed to ""Computer""?&gt;"
18-01-2018T22:45:56,CrRAR,I think you can change what to call it in the app
18-01-2018T22:45:58,CrRAR,yeah
18-01-2018T22:46:05,Twokinds,I can't change ok google

18-01-2018T22:46:52,KuroganeWatanoshi,Welp. I am going to go for now
18-01-2018T22:46:52,MuonNeutrino,"@Kamaro12 nora  gives very few fucks what other people think, it seems &gt;.&gt;"

18-01-2018T22:47:51,MuonNeutrino,"@Twokinds yes, but she's also more naked in this form than usual &gt;.&gt;"
18-01-2018T22:48:03,SageSaga,there are no corners- in the sphere...
18-01-2018T22:48:08,Ordithus,She wears even less clothing as a full dragon
18-01-2018T22:48:12,Mihari,You'll find a way
18-01-2018T22:48:16,Ordithus,Flora's completely naked!
18-01-2018T22:48:25,Ordithus,And no one is bothered by her.
18-01-2018T22:48:29,RedDeath2018,ikr
18-01-2018T22:48:33,Twokinds,-turns out dragons all normally wear clothes and she's just as much a nudist to them-
18-01-2018T22:48:40,ZRO4825,XD
18-01-2018T22:48:40,Ordithus,lol
18-01-2018T22:48:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
18-01-2018T22:48:46,MuonNeutrino,"well, the only OTHER dragon we've seen wears clothes even as a dragon &gt;.&gt;"
18-01-2018T22:48:47,Mihari,I could believe that
18-01-2018T22:48:53,Mihari,Given what we've seen of Remi XD
18-01-2018T22:48:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,look at Reni
18-01-2018T22:49:16,Bgrmystr2,"lol Reni just wears the armor, yeah"
18-01-2018T22:49:17,Bgrmystr2,?
18-01-2018T22:49:19,RedDeath2018,keith would not approve of any of that
18-01-2018T22:49:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,and a robe
18-01-2018T22:49:32,ZRO4825,"At the latest meeting of dragons: ""And on today's agenda....DAMNIT NORA, HOW MANY TIMES NOW???"""
18-01-2018T22:49:33,SageSaga,Keith is ok with nudity
18-01-2018T22:49:34,Ordithus,Not-saddlebags-but-saddlebags
18-01-2018T22:49:35,MuonNeutrino,"@Bgrmystr2 well, reni also wore a bathrobe at the estate"
18-01-2018T22:49:38,Bgrmystr2,"hey, as long as their ankles are covered, RedDeath :P"
18-01-2018T22:49:46,RedDeath2018,lol
18-01-2018T22:49:51,Bgrmystr2,probably because it's comfortable Muon
18-01-2018T22:50:11,ZRO4825,I'm just more surprised they had a bathrobe in her size at the estate XD
18-01-2018T22:50:24,ZRO4825,Maybe it was actually a set of curtains carefully disguised as a bathrobe? :thinking:
18-01-2018T22:50:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,she brought it with her
18-01-2018T22:50:44,MuonNeutrino,"@ZRO4825 any other estate, yeah i'd be surprised, but not at *trace's* estate. he likes dragons &gt;.&gt;"
18-01-2018T22:50:47,Bgrmystr2,you think Trade wouldn't have dragon-sized stuff in a place designed with dragon-sized visitors in mind?
18-01-2018T22:50:52,Bgrmystr2,..trace*
18-01-2018T22:50:55,Serpentfrog,"The estate was made to house dragon guests, if you recall."

18-01-2018T22:51:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,the true question is can the estate handle will smith?
18-01-2018T22:51:33,MuonNeutrino,"yeah, but that particular robe would have been much too small for nora, she's huge"
18-01-2018T22:51:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Sun
18-01-2018T22:51:36,Twokinds,"Probably more like ""augh grandma put on some clothes!"" - other dragons"
18-01-2018T22:51:38,MuonNeutrino,also she doesnt seem to wear clothes anyway
18-01-2018T22:51:43,Bgrmystr2,"only if Trace likes Will Smith, Marv."
18-01-2018T22:51:49,Bgrmystr2,"if he doesn't, then out to the back he goes."

18-01-2018T22:54:10,RedDeath2018,had to find out it starts at 8:00 pm the hard way
18-01-2018T22:54:16,Whitestripes,I like Foxworthy
18-01-2018T22:54:32,Ordithus,"Technically, Flora's stripes would be all poofy too.  That is work though."
18-01-2018T22:55:31,MuonNeutrino,i think that's what he's doing there - note that the stripes everywhere else are smooth
18-01-2018T22:55:46,CrRAR,fluff factor~
18-01-2018T22:55:48,Ordithus,realizes he's a dumb
