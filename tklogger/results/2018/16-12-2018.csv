16-12-2018T13:17:12,Twokinds,I'm not concerned.
16-12-2018T13:17:26,CrimsonQuill,I'm always concerned about crime.

16-12-2018T13:19:04,CrimsonQuill,That's good.

16-12-2018T13:19:19,Mippy,Yeah. Canada is not quite there yet either Quill. (As I just casually talk about a guy getting murderd)

16-12-2018T13:21:15,CrimsonQuill,I've been told it's about city services and land value.
16-12-2018T13:21:23,CrimsonQuill,I still don't understand it/
16-12-2018T13:21:31,Mippy,We have this really juncky trailer park right across the street from our neighbourhood.
16-12-2018T13:21:51,Twokinds,I think it's related.
16-12-2018T13:22:13,Twokinds,"Best locations get the best schools, which get the best service, which attracts people, then business, and value goes up."
16-12-2018T13:22:17,Twokinds,It's a circle.
16-12-2018T13:22:39,CrimsonQuill,It's one of the many reasons I dislike cities.
16-12-2018T13:23:32,Dadrobit,A quick note. America has only seen crime rates steadily decline since the 90s. Currently we're experiencing roughly the same rates as those seen in the 60s.
16-12-2018T13:23:46,Mippy,"It‚Äôs like when I tell people where I live ‚ÄúYou know where that real jacked up trailer park is on the east side? Yeah, I‚Äôm in the subdivision across from it‚Äù"

16-12-2018T13:25:28,Twokinds,"Markets are taking a big hit this year, though."
16-12-2018T13:25:40,CrimsonQuill,Blame the Brexit negotiations.
16-12-2018T13:25:47,CrimsonQuill,And terrified shareholders.
16-12-2018T13:25:55,CrimsonQuill,It's just the biggest mess...

16-12-2018T13:27:58,Dadrobit,"I don't listen to or watch anything political. When the vote comes up, I look at their voting history and how they've represented their standpoints and go off of that."

16-12-2018T15:17:48,CrimsonQuill,"Picarto is now being blocked by my computer-just half an hour ago. Something called DNS says that it's explicit material. I don't know what it's on about, but I'm having to use my phone now. What is happening?"

16-12-2018T15:20:00,TerraTheWizard,well dns is just the site address
16-12-2018T15:20:27,Xexanoth,are you on a housing network or something?
16-12-2018T15:20:27,TerraTheWizard,so someone has either set up a filter on your router or pc
16-12-2018T15:20:31,TerraTheWizard,or it's your isp

16-12-2018T15:24:10,CrimsonQuill,I'm in the British Isles
16-12-2018T15:24:20,TerraTheWizard,"the uk has the ""porn filter"" that you gotta request be turned off"

16-12-2018T15:25:10,CrimsonQuill,Blast!
16-12-2018T15:26:08,Xexanoth,easy test could be if you can access other widely known porn sites
16-12-2018T15:26:20,Xexanoth,cause then you know it's porn block
16-12-2018T15:26:36,CrimsonQuill,I never use that stuff.

16-12-2018T15:27:58,Xexanoth,"i mean, real life porn isn't rule 34, but i guess that would work too"
16-12-2018T15:28:24,CrimsonQuill,I keep away from anything I consider 'porn'.
16-12-2018T15:28:28,Xexanoth,also it's simply to help you figure out your problem
16-12-2018T15:28:37,CrimsonQuill,I can't do that

16-12-2018T15:31:33,CrimsonQuill,The fact I can use it on my phone means it isn't the wifi
16-12-2018T15:31:44,Xexanoth,true dat
16-12-2018T15:31:46,TerraTheWizard,try restarting your pc
16-12-2018T15:32:08,TerraTheWizard,if that doesn't work you can try changing your dns

16-12-2018T17:52:58,RimaDraws,hi tom
16-12-2018T17:53:51,Twokinds,Hi Rima!
16-12-2018T17:54:06,RimaDraws,how is your day going?
16-12-2018T17:54:43,Twokinds,Good good
16-12-2018T17:55:47,Twokinds,Just finished sewing up a giant tear in my favorite pajama pants
16-12-2018T17:56:38,Twokinds,The entire pant leg somehow ended up tearing almost in half
16-12-2018T17:56:50,TerraTheWizard,achievement get!
16-12-2018T17:58:53,RimaDraws,oh my. well at least you know how to patch it up.
16-12-2018T18:10:50,RimaDraws,im rewatching rwby
16-12-2018T18:12:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom sewed! üèÖ
16-12-2018T18:13:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though if we wanna talk puzzles, you should see the abomination that is ‚Äúedge less‚Äù puzzles"
16-12-2018T18:13:35,RimaDraws,wow
16-12-2018T18:13:49,SpazztasticKiwi,They‚Äôre puzzles with no rounded or squared edges plus extra pieces
16-12-2018T18:14:03,SpazztasticKiwi,that you won‚Äôt need for the actual puzzle
16-12-2018T18:14:21,RimaDraws,sounds like a puzzle from hell
16-12-2018T18:14:31,TerraTheWizard,good lord
16-12-2018T18:14:43,TerraTheWizard,why would people subject themselves to such torture
16-12-2018T18:15:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Somebody wanted to invent something and thought ‚Äúyou know what‚Äôll really piss people off?‚Äù
16-12-2018T18:16:56,RimaDraws,a puzzle with no edges
16-12-2018T18:17:07,RimaDraws,that would trigger my OCD
16-12-2018T18:17:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Just shave it down when it‚Äôs done
16-12-2018T18:17:41,RimaDraws,haha no
16-12-2018T18:17:42,RimaDraws,lol
16-12-2018T18:17:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I like the crystal puzzles with the itty bitty diamonds
16-12-2018T18:18:44,RimaDraws,have you seen the clear 3D puzzles?
16-12-2018T18:18:49,RimaDraws,i wanna try those
16-12-2018T18:18:58,SpazztasticKiwi,My sister has the horse one
16-12-2018T18:19:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd like the Aurora one
16-12-2018T18:24:22,Dadrobit,"Good on ya, Tom. Coincidentally, the niece just got into sewing and had me use the apron she just made in class last week from some old cloth she had around the house."
16-12-2018T18:24:38,Dadrobit,S'a useful skill.
16-12-2018T18:25:23,Twokinds,"Yeah, don't want to throw something away if I don't have to."
16-12-2018T18:25:53,RimaDraws,i dont blame you
16-12-2018T18:25:55,RimaDraws,saves money
16-12-2018T18:26:02,Twokinds,"My sewing is not pretty, but well, they're pajama pants that go with my bath robe. So I don't care how they look."
16-12-2018T18:26:41,Dadrobit,Machine or hand stitched?
16-12-2018T18:27:07,Twokinds,I don't own a sewing machine.
16-12-2018T18:27:24,Twokinds,I haven't used a sewing machine since home ec in high school
16-12-2018T18:27:37,RimaDraws,i have one but havent
16-12-2018T18:27:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Ive done the same for some pants I had. I can stitch decently straight
16-12-2018T18:28:06,Dadrobit,Oof. I feel ya. Hand stitched half of my booth baffling before I ended up borrowing my father's machine.
16-12-2018T18:28:28,SpazztasticKiwi,at least I still remember how to use a machine and sew period
16-12-2018T18:29:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I once met a guy whose approach to losing a button on a pair of pants meant buying another new pair
16-12-2018T18:30:12,Dadrobit,That's why I get the pants that also have the inner clasp. Lose one? Still got the backup before I need a new pair.
16-12-2018T18:31:04,SpazztasticKiwi,The what
16-12-2018T18:31:12,Dadrobit,"So long as I've got my belt on, who's gonna call me out on it?"
16-12-2018T18:31:26,SpazztasticKiwi,TSA
16-12-2018T18:31:35,Dadrobit,Fuck the airport police
16-12-2018T18:32:01,Dadrobit,"(JK I love you TSA, please don't make me take off my shoes again...)"
16-12-2018T18:32:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I swear my shoes are never as tight as when I was in that TSA line
16-12-2018T18:33:31,Dadrobit,"Also, I wear dress pants 95% of the times that I wear pants, and they usually have inner metal clasps in addition to the button."
16-12-2018T18:34:25,SpazztasticKiwi,oh that little inner thing
16-12-2018T18:35:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Some women‚Äôs dress pants have them
16-12-2018T18:35:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Not a fan
16-12-2018T18:39:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I prefer men‚Äôs stuff anyway. Jeans may end up being loose but it‚Äôs all in the name of pockets
16-12-2018T18:42:26,Twokinds,pockets are nice to have
16-12-2018T18:42:37,Twokinds,Can't imagine trying to go without.
16-12-2018T18:43:26,Dadrobit,Actual Hell
16-12-2018T18:43:58,RimaDraws,i cant imagine not having pockets
16-12-2018T18:45:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Try having pockets that are JUST small enough that half your phone hangs out and it drops out every time you sit down
16-12-2018T18:45:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause there‚Äôs that issue too
16-12-2018T18:46:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Only complaint I have for the jeans I got now is they‚Äôre mega loose in my waist. But when I tried pulling the size lower pair past my thighs they laughed so
16-12-2018T18:46:44,Twokinds,I'd rather not try that
16-12-2018T18:47:35,Dadrobit,Belts. Belts are a thing.
16-12-2018T18:48:46,Dadrobit,"I love belts, they're like a constant reminder of how much weight I've lost/gained. Very motivational to stay in shape and never let myself go too far."
16-12-2018T18:49:18,Dadrobit,Part of why I've been dieting for a few weeks actually. It was getting tough to hit my regular belt hole comfortably.
16-12-2018T18:52:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Belts dig in
16-12-2018T18:56:13,Bgrmystr2,dig into what though? They go in the slots in your pants and never touch yourskin
16-12-2018T18:56:24,Bgrmystr2,"and if they're too tight, then loosen the belt."
16-12-2018T19:07:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Buckle usually
16-12-2018T19:07:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Presses on the button when I sit
16-12-2018T19:08:47,Bgrmystr2,maybe get a different buckle? or different belt perhaps
16-12-2018T19:11:54,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:

16-12-2018T21:20:30,Twokinds,"Sounds great, I always like to see new artists get into comic making"
16-12-2018T21:21:02,Twokinds,New comic making.

16-12-2018T22:38:21,Bgrmystr2,so I mean

16-12-2018T22:43:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"In other news, I fed Peeka last night. She ate 5 mice"
16-12-2018T22:44:08,Bgrmystr2,do you just... buy mice to feed em?
16-12-2018T22:44:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Flash frozen yeah
16-12-2018T22:44:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Fuzzies
16-12-2018T22:44:25,Bgrmystr2,oh
16-12-2018T22:44:27,Bgrmystr2,well okay
16-12-2018T22:44:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera wanted at them too
16-12-2018T22:44:40,Bgrmystr2,I was thinking she caught that many
16-12-2018T22:45:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Well pac man frogs are sit predators. They don‚Äôt move but to lurch forward and grab something
16-12-2018T22:45:13,Bgrmystr2,"and I'm just.. how the fuck does a cat catch FIVE mice in a single house.. and if you have five goddamned mice in your house, you may have a serious problem."
16-12-2018T22:45:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"Basically, if it doesn‚Äôt crawl in front of them, they don‚Äôt bother"
16-12-2018T22:45:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Peeka is a frog
16-12-2018T23:02:52,Ordithus,"Kiwi has a frog, and Bgr is missing a thumb"
16-12-2018T23:02:55,Ordithus,What have I missed
16-12-2018T23:04:59,Bgrmystr2,"not sure it matters, peeka could be a snake or falcon or anything, and it still would bother me if you had 5 mice living in your house and you didn't know about em"
16-12-2018T23:07:02,Ordithus,Refugees from NIMH
16-12-2018T23:08:02,unsteddyphoenix,HELLO

16-12-2018T23:20:43,Ordithus,wb :ctwokinds-FloDance:
16-12-2018T23:24:06,SpazztasticKiwi,The cats catch mice. But they actually catch. Peeka is fed captive mice cause they‚Äôre more nutritious and wild mice could have bad effects
16-12-2018T23:24:36,SpazztasticKiwi,And live mice could bite her
16-12-2018T23:25:51,RimaDraws,ty
16-12-2018T23:48:32,unsteddyphoenix,You feed your frog mice?
16-12-2018T23:56:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah
16-12-2018T23:56:18,SpazztasticKiwi,She has teeth you know
16-12-2018T23:57:18,unsteddyphoenix,Frogs...have teeth? :thinking:
16-12-2018T23:57:29,unsteddyphoenix,I cant remember ever seeing a frogs teeth
16-12-2018T23:58:36,Ordithus,"They don't really chew their food, though, really"
