03-06-2018T00:03:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Probably
03-06-2018T00:06:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh and did you gain any weight from being off your diet Tom?
03-06-2018T00:23:02,Twokinds,Yes! :D
03-06-2018T00:24:00,SpazztasticKiwi,You seem happy about that. Thought you were trying to lose it
03-06-2018T00:24:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Or is it more of a “worth it” senario
03-06-2018T00:24:55,Twokinds,Well the whole point of losing weight is so you can gain it back again.
03-06-2018T00:25:41,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
03-06-2018T00:27:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Your motives revealed
03-06-2018T00:27:43,Bgrmystr2,"Fairly sure the point of losing weight is to NOT gain it back, IE to not weigh as much. And stay like that"
03-06-2018T00:27:54,Bgrmystr2,gaining the weight back.. defeated the purpose of the diet to begin with xD
03-06-2018T00:28:24,Bgrmystr2,I dunno.. why even diet at all at that point?
03-06-2018T00:28:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I doubt it
03-06-2018T00:28:40,unsteddyphoenix,congrats on the weight :D
03-06-2018T00:28:51,SpazztasticKiwi,was enough of a regain to be a problem
03-06-2018T00:29:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah. Congrats on the new weight
03-06-2018T00:29:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Is it a boy or a girl
03-06-2018T00:29:24,Bgrmystr2,"I'm talking in general, kiwi, not tom specifically"
03-06-2018T00:29:29,Bgrmystr2,tom's just strange.
03-06-2018T00:29:39,BadFoMo,Weight gain fetish?
03-06-2018T00:29:56,SpazztasticKiwi,*whispers* Tom’s an alien
03-06-2018T00:29:57,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering: I..
03-06-2018T00:30:04,Bgrmystr2,I don't.. know Fomo
03-06-2018T00:30:07,Twokinds,The only way to keep weight off forever is to die.
03-06-2018T00:30:38,Bgrmystr2,or to just eat properly instead of always junk foods and fast foods :v
03-06-2018T00:30:41,SpazztasticKiwi,That diet is to die for
03-06-2018T00:30:46,Bgrmystr2,lolo
03-06-2018T00:31:02,FenceEqualizer,That is dark
03-06-2018T00:31:17,SpazztasticKiwi,You really get that slim figure laying in the coffin
03-06-2018T00:31:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"But yeah - new theory: tom is alien, not a robot"
03-06-2018T00:32:00,Twokinds,"Yeah but what fun is that. Better to lose weight, then feast, then lose again."
03-06-2018T00:32:28,BadFoMo,"""Deadly Diet"""
03-06-2018T00:32:32,Twokinds,Variety is the spice of life.
03-06-2018T00:33:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Says the guy that stays home all day
03-06-2018T00:33:09,Bgrmystr2,"that just sounds like unneeded drama and not fun at all, tom"
03-06-2018T00:33:11,SpazztasticKiwi,And rarely goes out
03-06-2018T00:33:11,Bgrmystr2,xD
03-06-2018T00:33:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Or socializes
03-06-2018T00:33:24,BadFoMo,...And draws furries.
03-06-2018T00:33:34,Dadrobit,"Back, folks made it home, helped 'em unpack."
03-06-2018T00:33:43,BadFoMo,Cool.
03-06-2018T00:34:16,FenceEqualizer,WB glad to hear the spare was strong
03-06-2018T00:34:25,Dadrobit,"Pops busted his scalp open when he was changing the tire, so I needed to do the heavy lifting so he could just lie down and fix himself."
03-06-2018T00:34:46,Bgrmystr2,:/
03-06-2018T00:34:50,Bgrmystr2,hope he'll be okay
03-06-2018T00:34:58,Bgrmystr2,injuries like that can be very bad
03-06-2018T00:35:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom I gotta random side question
03-06-2018T00:36:04,FenceEqualizer,Owww. Not serious I hope.
03-06-2018T00:36:20,Dadrobit,"Yeah. He'll be fine. He's got a nasty gash about 2 inches long right on the top of his skull, but he's cleaned it up as well as he could at the time, and he went to do another as I was leaving their house."
03-06-2018T00:36:24,FenceEqualizer,And just a superficial wound
03-06-2018T00:36:43,SpazztasticKiwi,What do you think Kat world do if Eric booped her on the nose?
03-06-2018T00:37:03,Dadrobit,"It was gnarly, but there's nothing a doctor could do about it that he couldn't do himself at this point."
03-06-2018T00:37:15,FenceEqualizer,He might want to get that stitched up later
03-06-2018T00:37:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, that sounds rough Dadro. They didn’t consider stitches at all?"
03-06-2018T00:37:33,Dadrobit,Doctors won't stitch up old wounds.
03-06-2018T00:37:57,Dadrobit,It was already scabbed by the time they got home.
03-06-2018T00:38:28,SpazztasticKiwi,So gauze pad and big band aid?
03-06-2018T00:38:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Or just gonna keep it clean and watch it
03-06-2018T00:38:53,Dadrobit,Keep it clean and watch it.
03-06-2018T00:39:03,FenceEqualizer,Disinfectants keep it clean
03-06-2018T00:39:20,Dadrobit,Bonus points for doing the day before he has to go to a welding certification camp for his school.
03-06-2018T00:39:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Not awfully serious then. Sending healing feelings
03-06-2018T00:40:04,Dadrobit,"I mean, the skin was clearly fucked up, but he'll live."
03-06-2018T00:40:37,FenceEqualizer,Probably going to get some scarring but that's what hair is for
03-06-2018T00:40:53,Dadrobit,"It'll scar like hell, but he's got a good head of hair for that."
03-06-2018T00:41:31,Dadrobit,He was more pissed than worried tbh. lol
03-06-2018T00:41:47,SpazztasticKiwi,My dad had a scar on his jaw from being hit by a car. He liked to grow out his beard to hide it
03-06-2018T00:42:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Hair is the original cover up
03-06-2018T00:44:08,BadFoMo,"@SpazztasticKiwi If Eric boobed Kathrin's nose, it would caues Kathrin to turn back into a male and turn Eric into a female."
03-06-2018T00:44:28,BadFoMo,Extrim Magical Tag!
03-06-2018T00:45:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Now I do believe that’s something I need in my life
03-06-2018T00:46:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel like she’d maul him
03-06-2018T00:46:20,unsteddyphoenix,tfw you'll never boop Kats snoot :(
03-06-2018T00:46:34,unsteddyphoenix,"I dont really think she's the ""mauling"" type"
03-06-2018T00:46:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I know. She’s got a very boopable button nose :ctwokinds-katdryer:
03-06-2018T00:47:01,unsteddyphoenix,My kingdom for a boop
03-06-2018T00:47:14,unsteddyphoenix,Zen stuck his head in her boobs and came out unscathed so
03-06-2018T00:47:27,SpazztasticKiwi,He was also half unconscious
03-06-2018T00:47:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a feeling if he’d done it on purpose he’d be missing more than a leg
03-06-2018T00:47:52,unsteddyphoenix,"you think that'd stop, say Flora?"
03-06-2018T00:47:54,unsteddyphoenix,I dont
03-06-2018T00:48:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Are you suggesting Flora boop Kat
03-06-2018T00:48:38,unsteddyphoenix,No but I like this.
03-06-2018T00:49:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder how Flora is gonna handle the pregnancy symptoms
03-06-2018T00:50:36,unsteddyphoenix,When will they start showing up?
03-06-2018T00:50:51,unsteddyphoenix,"Keidran pregnancies are accelerated, maybe all the symptoms will be too"
03-06-2018T00:51:06,unsteddyphoenix,Goes from extreme cravings to mood swings to cramps within hours
03-06-2018T00:55:22,FenceEqualizer,The mood swings will make her a terror
03-06-2018T00:56:59,unsteddyphoenix,"S'true. She can already be fairly emotional, so mood swings added on to that..."
03-06-2018T00:58:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"I was thinking of the sore boobs and swollen, well everything, but yeah. Mood swings and cravings"
03-06-2018T00:58:53,FenceEqualizer,R.I.P Trace.

03-06-2018T01:00:19,FenceEqualizer,Saving Grace she'll be to happy for bigger chest to maul everyone within distance
03-06-2018T01:01:16,unsteddyphoenix,Boobs work as a distraction for women too sometimes
03-06-2018T01:01:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Trace gonna be on pins and needles

03-06-2018T01:40:28,unsteddyphoenix,Oh. I...really thought it was.
03-06-2018T01:40:30,unsteddyphoenix,Hm
03-06-2018T01:40:46,FenceEqualizer,Would be a nice one though
03-06-2018T01:41:15,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah is good
03-06-2018T01:41:49,Dadrobit,One day.... https://www.patreon.com/posts/basitin-dinner-14518866
03-06-2018T01:43:15,unsteddyphoenix,The sketch is really clean
03-06-2018T01:43:27,Dadrobit,"Got so much flak for that, it actually boggles the mind."
03-06-2018T01:43:37,FenceEqualizer,"It is, Tom did a really nice job on that one"
03-06-2018T01:43:44,Dadrobit,"Yeah, Tom really went all out on it."
03-06-2018T01:43:51,TheBeckoner,That sketch is aslightly before me being here. just saw it now.
03-06-2018T01:43:55,TheBeckoner,seems pretty good to me
03-06-2018T01:44:01,Dadrobit,"If you're still here, Tom thanks again!"
03-06-2018T01:44:02,TheBeckoner,slightly*
03-06-2018T01:44:12,FenceEqualizer,No one wants the idea of Nantani being dead
03-06-2018T01:44:28,FenceEqualizer,Or I should say the shippers
03-06-2018T01:44:38,Dadrobit,"Lol, Beck. That took 7 months of campaigning before Tom just did a Tom Pick on it."
03-06-2018T01:44:46,unsteddyphoenix,keittani is so pwerful
03-06-2018T01:44:48,unsteddyphoenix,We saw that today
03-06-2018T01:44:53,unsteddyphoenix,Keithtani &gt; lesbians
03-06-2018T01:45:06,Bgrmystr2,yeah
03-06-2018T01:45:08,Bgrmystr2,ONE VOTE
03-06-2018T01:45:18,TheBeckoner,By slightly I mean the actually image of it.
03-06-2018T01:45:31,FenceEqualizer,Too strong!
03-06-2018T01:45:39,TheBeckoner,Seems like a good one to color tho
03-06-2018T01:45:55,Dadrobit,My ship in comparison https://i.imgur.com/8Dh8Tgo.jpg
03-06-2018T01:46:11,Bgrmystr2,hahaha noooo
03-06-2018T01:46:39,unsteddyphoenix,Oof ouch my ship
03-06-2018T01:46:40,FenceEqualizer,The after math of crossing patches with SS KxN
03-06-2018T01:47:06,FenceEqualizer,Paths* F you autocorrect
03-06-2018T01:47:09,unsteddyphoenix,Tom was pretty reluctant at first
03-06-2018T01:47:14,unsteddyphoenix,to draw that
03-06-2018T01:47:15,Dadrobit,Still in better shape than my Keiren Natani ship.
03-06-2018T01:47:30,Dadrobit,":/ Not at first, at first he liked the idea."
03-06-2018T01:47:38,Dadrobit,Then the backlash hit I think.
03-06-2018T01:47:59,Dadrobit,"First two weeks he was for it, then he got more hesitant."
03-06-2018T01:48:12,FenceEqualizer,Heh I remembered. Tom got to the point of asking if you want to suggest something else
03-06-2018T01:49:18,FenceEqualizer,But Robit determination got him through. Despite a few people bad mouthing
03-06-2018T01:49:33,unsteddyphoenix,Dedication is endearing
03-06-2018T01:49:53,unsteddyphoenix,Even if it's dedication for one of the most popular characters being dead
03-06-2018T01:49:56,Dadrobit,"And threats, don't forget the threats."
03-06-2018T01:50:09,Dadrobit,Fuckin' people man.
03-06-2018T01:50:23,Dadrobit,Worry about pixels so much.
03-06-2018T01:50:55,FenceEqualizer,Well all fandoms will have there pinch of crazy
03-06-2018T01:51:00,Dadrobit,"""Oh Lord, what ever will I do if a single sketch happens that I don't like the ramifications of?!?"""
03-06-2018T01:52:10,Bgrmystr2,bitch and moan and cry and attempt to make everyone hate it with no reason for them to do so.
03-06-2018T01:52:15,Bgrmystr2,tis what they do now.
03-06-2018T01:52:16,unsteddyphoenix,Kat and Zen?? Im freaking oUUTTTT
03-06-2018T01:52:20,unsteddyphoenix,AAAAAAA
03-06-2018T01:52:27,FenceEqualizer,You don't understand! You're destroying their world!
03-06-2018T01:52:34,Bgrmystr2,"good, fence xD"
03-06-2018T01:52:36,Bgrmystr2,good.
03-06-2018T01:52:45,Bgrmystr2,maybe they'll get the fuck out of their bubble lol
03-06-2018T01:53:14,unsteddyphoenix,My entire life is flipturned upsidedown
03-06-2018T01:53:15,Dadrobit,Dank meme unsteddy
03-06-2018T01:53:15,Bgrmystr2,all the hate seems super unnecessary imo :/
03-06-2018T01:53:17,FenceEqualizer,But mah safety bubble!
03-06-2018T01:53:37,Bgrmystr2,the characters are not even real
03-06-2018T01:53:40,Bgrmystr2,why does it matter XD
03-06-2018T01:53:51,unsteddyphoenix,NO KAT IS REAL SHUP UP &gt;:((((((((
03-06-2018T01:53:57,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-unimpressed:
03-06-2018T01:53:58,Dadrobit,I think it's got to do with the waifu mentality.
03-06-2018T01:54:31,Dadrobit,People have these imaginary friends in their head that the cling to so damn much because they're perfect in their mind.
03-06-2018T01:54:35,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s kinda the same way when a celebrity gets a girlfriend or boyfriend
03-06-2018T01:54:37,Bgrmystr2,"duno about that, dadro. Some ppl I know have waifus and can differenciate between comics and reality"
03-06-2018T01:54:46,Dadrobit,they cling*
03-06-2018T01:55:03,Dadrobit,"""Some"""
03-06-2018T01:55:56,Dadrobit,"But then you also get enough of the ""Others"" that are bat-shit crazy about their mental buddies that it becomes burdensome."
03-06-2018T01:56:02,Bgrmystr2,yeah some. I don't think it's an indicator of the waifu mentality as a whole. It just happens to be connected in instinces
03-06-2018T01:56:19,Bgrmystr2,instances*
03-06-2018T01:56:33,FenceEqualizer,Yeah those ones need to take a minute to just sit
03-06-2018T01:56:41,SpazztasticKiwi,“WHY ARE YOU DATING HIM/HER -YOU’RE MINE”
03-06-2018T01:56:47,Bgrmystr2,lolo
03-06-2018T01:56:50,Dadrobit,And perhaps get shot in the chest with live horse shit.
03-06-2018T01:57:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"It’s like, first of all, they’re old enough to be your parent"
03-06-2018T01:57:36,Bgrmystr2,some ppl out there are fucked sideways.. if it wasn't a character from a comic or show..
03-06-2018T01:57:39,Bgrmystr2,it'd be something else
03-06-2018T01:57:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Calm your hormonal tits
03-06-2018T01:57:41,Dadrobit,"Because in their mind, that person is someone that agrees with them in every way. It's the imaginary fantasy they've built for themselves."
03-06-2018T01:58:10,Bgrmystr2,"it's just about being overtly obsessed with something, could be anything"
03-06-2018T01:58:43,Bgrmystr2,characters are just easy to latch onto cuz they resemble people
03-06-2018T01:58:49,Xexanoth,"now remembers every discussion of Natanais gender were people just went ""NATANI IS MALE AND IF YOU DISAGREE YOU'RE TRANSPHOBIC!"""
03-06-2018T01:58:53,Dadrobit,"Like, how many people consider themselves friends with Tom, or even Mark? Vs how many people Does Tom actually consider a friend?"
03-06-2018T01:59:21,Bgrmystr2,"xex, there were so many of those"
03-06-2018T01:59:26,FenceEqualizer,That is always the first mistake they make
03-06-2018T01:59:34,Dadrobit,"I'm a wee bit less than fully lucid, so if I stop making sense, please forgive my transgressions."
03-06-2018T01:59:55,Dadrobit,I'm having issues trying to elucidate in a timely manner.
03-06-2018T02:00:08,FenceEqualizer,Nah you make sense so far.
03-06-2018T02:00:09,Bgrmystr2,lotta ppl super obsess with stuff to the point where it starts negatively impacting others
03-06-2018T02:00:13,Bgrmystr2,and yeah agree w/ fence
03-06-2018T02:00:17,Bgrmystr2,you're good so far dadro
03-06-2018T02:00:23,Dadrobit,"Ah, swell!"
03-06-2018T02:00:32,Bgrmystr2,:thumbsup:
03-06-2018T02:01:57,Dadrobit,"But yeah, like everyone here considers Tom and most everyone else here buddies, but man, we only get to see snippets of everyone around us here, and only the snippets they want everyone else to see."
03-06-2018T02:02:31,Bgrmystr2,"I don't think it'd be the waifus though, cuz if the same ppl here who obsess over characters were in some other community.. they'd just obsess over something else to the point of bothering others"
03-06-2018T02:02:48,Bgrmystr2,and yeah I think that's part of it
03-06-2018T02:02:58,Dadrobit,"So even though only like 3 folks here actually know me irl, it's easy to create a fairly complete picture of what we ~want~ everyone to be in our heads."
03-06-2018T02:03:05,Bgrmystr2,some of the ppl in the community obsess with tom himself rather than the comic
03-06-2018T02:04:37,Dadrobit,I was only using waifu as a generalization of fascinations with imaginary ideal of fictional figures. Wasn't being completely literal there.
03-06-2018T02:04:44,Dadrobit,ideals*
03-06-2018T02:05:07,FenceEqualizer,True enough. Then those people become a huge bother and can't seem to wrapped their mind around that they're doing too much.
03-06-2018T02:05:28,Bgrmystr2,"Well yeh, I figured, I was trying to find somethin or other, kinda lost it goin back and forth between computers trying to deal w/ win10 without a keyboard"
03-06-2018T02:06:29,Dadrobit,"Like, sure, I do that with my #QualitySuggestions, but I think at least that it's fairly obvious that I'm a flippant and facetious cunt."
03-06-2018T02:06:39,Dadrobit,I do it for the irony.
03-06-2018T02:07:14,Dadrobit,"But the ones that are really, really in it. That's just so offputting."
03-06-2018T02:07:40,Bgrmystr2,"me, I just kinda.. hang back and watch the community interact, and see who I wanna be bothered talkin to.. cuz some ppl just aren't worth it, not cuz I can't make good coversation but cuz I'm just terrible at withholding calling out ppl"
03-06-2018T02:07:44,Bgrmystr2,so I just rather lurk
03-06-2018T02:08:19,Bgrmystr2,made some mistakes already in this community lol
03-06-2018T02:08:21,Bgrmystr2,so
03-06-2018T02:08:24,Bgrmystr2,:u
03-06-2018T02:10:17,Dadrobit,":/ I don't think I've made too many mistakes. Like, whenever I screw up, I feel that the bright side is that every tragedy you make, you can twist into an entertaining story down the road."
03-06-2018T02:10:25,FenceEqualizer,Well some people do get a little sensitive here
03-06-2018T02:11:01,FenceEqualizer,Good outlook to have Robit
03-06-2018T02:11:44,Dadrobit,Comedy is just an equation of tragedy over time.
03-06-2018T02:13:30,Bgrmystr2,"well, I don't regret anything I've done"
03-06-2018T02:13:41,Bgrmystr2,just.. know what kind of people to avoid in the future
03-06-2018T02:13:52,Bgrmystr2,cuz some good things came from it
03-06-2018T02:13:56,Bgrmystr2,and met good people from it too
03-06-2018T02:14:21,Dadrobit,I know who to avoid. Androgynous Optometrists. My kryptonite.
03-06-2018T02:14:33,TheBeckoner,What makes me feel better is that we all die anyway so the small inconvenient things dont matter much anyhow.
03-06-2018T02:17:47,Xexanoth,"i don't think people really remember any ""mistakes"" anyone makes, unless it's something pretty big...."
03-06-2018T02:18:19,Xexanoth,like the kind of stuff that gets you banned
03-06-2018T02:19:12,Bgrmystr2,"oh, I remember some mistakes I make. Mainly people I took chances with."
03-06-2018T02:19:20,Bgrmystr2,some of those were mistakes.
03-06-2018T02:19:49,Xexanoth,"well, yes, you remember, but other people don't."
03-06-2018T02:19:56,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, pity"
03-06-2018T02:20:13,Bgrmystr2,so many ppl I meet don't recall their mistakes and thus don't learn from them
03-06-2018T02:20:26,TheBeckoner,or choose not to
03-06-2018T02:20:30,Bgrmystr2,one of the ppl I live with reeks ofi t
03-06-2018T02:20:32,Bgrmystr2,of it*
03-06-2018T02:20:54,Xexanoth,let me rephrase properly: people remember their own mistakes much better then other peoples mistakes
03-06-2018T02:21:13,Xexanoth,"basicially, the embarassing thing you did years ago? yeah no one but you remembers that shit"
03-06-2018T02:21:14,Bgrmystr2,xD well that's different
03-06-2018T02:21:29,Bgrmystr2,"also, my friends are definitely the wrong ppl for that"
03-06-2018T02:21:33,Bgrmystr2,cuz they remember ALL dat shit
03-06-2018T02:21:40,Bgrmystr2,and I am the same for them
03-06-2018T02:21:44,Xexanoth,"well, it depends how funny it was XD"
03-06-2018T02:21:48,Dadrobit,"Until you re-tell it to them with a smile, then they remember."
03-06-2018T02:21:52,Bgrmystr2,hahaha
03-06-2018T02:22:00,Bgrmystr2,yeah usually it's the funny shit
03-06-2018T02:22:02,Bgrmystr2,we remember
03-06-2018T02:22:35,unsteddyphoenix,What if you dont make any mistakes though :thinking:
03-06-2018T02:22:36,Dadrobit,"Fuck man, I lost a girlfriend mid-coitus from laughing at my own joke too hard, I will literally joke about damned near anything about myself."
03-06-2018T02:22:43,Xexanoth,but a lot of times you're just embarassed yourself and no one else forgets it the next day.
03-06-2018T02:22:49,Bgrmystr2,"then you're not real, phoenix"
03-06-2018T02:22:53,Xexanoth,*everyone else
03-06-2018T02:22:59,unsteddyphoenix,phoenixs arent real it's true
03-06-2018T02:23:06,Bgrmystr2,see
03-06-2018T02:23:07,Xexanoth,"arg, 6 hourse of sleep aren't enough"

03-06-2018T02:23:21,unsteddyphoenix,I got less~
03-06-2018T02:23:54,unsteddyphoenix,"I wonder if on sunday streams im noticably different, since I always get 4-ish hours sleep"
03-06-2018T02:24:07,Bgrmystr2,uhh
03-06-2018T02:24:12,Bgrmystr2,not.. from what I've seen
03-06-2018T02:24:19,unsteddyphoenix,neat!
03-06-2018T02:24:39,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: I didn't think about paying attention to see if you WERE different
03-06-2018T02:24:50,Bgrmystr2,I just kinda accepted whatever it was that happened
03-06-2018T02:25:05,Xexanoth,"given that the chat is just random bullshit most of the stream, it would be hard to notice"
03-06-2018T02:25:12,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, that too"
03-06-2018T02:25:14,unsteddyphoenix,Thats true
03-06-2018T02:25:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I need to go on to bed - I’ll be back tomorrow
03-06-2018T02:25:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Night Tom
03-06-2018T02:25:50,FenceEqualizer,It's the Radom bull that gives the chat that spice of life
03-06-2018T02:25:52,Dadrobit,"Night, Spazz."

03-06-2018T02:26:21,Bgrmystr2,or is now diamonds?
03-06-2018T02:26:31,Bgrmystr2,one of those..
03-06-2018T02:26:34,Dadrobit,Controls the universe.
03-06-2018T02:26:37,Bgrmystr2,oh.
03-06-2018T02:26:47,Bgrmystr2,yeah that too.
03-06-2018T02:26:47,unsteddyphoenix,So all I need is spice to make my waifu real....
03-06-2018T02:26:49,FenceEqualizer,Must be some damn good spice
03-06-2018T02:27:26,Dadrobit,:/ No Dune appreciators in here tonight huh?
03-06-2018T02:27:37,Bgrmystr2,lol.. I never played Dune
03-06-2018T02:27:41,Bgrmystr2,:c
03-06-2018T02:27:44,Dadrobit,"""played""......"
03-06-2018T02:27:59,FenceEqualizer,Never Read/watch dune
03-06-2018T02:28:02,unsteddyphoenix,I never ate dune
03-06-2018T02:28:08,Bgrmystr2,my first encounter with Dune was the game from Westwood
03-06-2018T02:28:09,unsteddyphoenix,Is it spicy?
03-06-2018T02:28:15,FenceEqualizer,Younger me was convinced it would be boring
03-06-2018T02:28:53,Dadrobit,It's an amazing book. One of the best.
03-06-2018T02:29:15,Bgrmystr2,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_II
03-06-2018T02:29:17,FenceEqualizer,Adult me...well forgot all about the series until now.
03-06-2018T02:29:34,Bgrmystr2,"I never played it, but it was my introduction to it"
03-06-2018T02:29:35,FenceEqualizer,Maybe I'll snag it on my kindle one day
03-06-2018T02:29:53,Bgrmystr2,"I didn't know anything about it, and it didn't catch my interest, so I never looked into it"
03-06-2018T02:30:04,Xexanoth,the followup Battle for Dune was a better Dune Movie than most Dune Movies
03-06-2018T02:30:34,Xexanoth,also a pretty good RTS
03-06-2018T02:30:57,FenceEqualizer,Or catch one of the old sci-fi reruns of the show
03-06-2018T02:31:16,Bgrmystr2,I recall seeing the game Dune 2000 as well
03-06-2018T02:31:20,Bgrmystr2,didn't nab that one either
03-06-2018T02:31:49,FenceEqualizer,And I will never call it Syfy! Don't care if they changed there station name :ptv-unimpressed:
03-06-2018T02:31:59,Bgrmystr2,"I still don't know much about it other than it was originally a book, correct?"
03-06-2018T02:32:06,Dadrobit,Correct.
03-06-2018T02:32:32,Bgrmystr2,"yeah that's as far as I know about it. It's a book, it's about spice, and big worms"
03-06-2018T02:32:40,Dadrobit,1965. Holds up to this day
03-06-2018T02:33:05,Xexanoth,Dune 2000 was just the upgraded version of Dune 2
03-06-2018T02:33:08,Dadrobit,Pop media references it ~everywhere~
03-06-2018T02:34:48,FenceEqualizer,Oh snap think I just found the full audio book to dune on YouTube
03-06-2018T02:34:58,Bgrmystr2,"sorry I'm not /in/ on your dune references, Dadro :("
03-06-2018T02:35:24,Dadrobit,So am I
03-06-2018T02:35:29,Xexanoth,*rings bell* SHAME! SHAME!
03-06-2018T02:35:44,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, I never liked reading novels all that much in school"
03-06-2018T02:35:54,Xexanoth,or however that scene in GoT goes...
03-06-2018T02:36:09,Bgrmystr2,"they made us read a few books, but none of the titles I see other ppl read"
03-06-2018T02:36:16,Bgrmystr2,and they were.. okay
03-06-2018T02:36:20,Bgrmystr2,nothing interesting
03-06-2018T02:36:52,Bgrmystr2,I know they made us read The Outsiders
03-06-2018T02:36:59,Bgrmystr2,strange book to read in elementary
03-06-2018T02:37:40,Dadrobit,"Fence, is the first line ""In the week before their departure to Arrakis..."""
03-06-2018T02:37:44,Dadrobit,?
03-06-2018T02:39:13,unsteddyphoenix,I used to love reading...but now my attention span is shot thanks obama
03-06-2018T02:39:29,Dadrobit,"It might also be, ""A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care..."""
03-06-2018T02:39:40,unsteddyphoenix,How many books is the dune series?
03-06-2018T02:39:44,Dadrobit,A lot.
03-06-2018T02:39:58,Dadrobit,But the original is the one to read.
03-06-2018T02:40:35,Bgrmystr2,"reading is okay.. I just.. meh. I dislike the lack of interaction. I'm being told a story that cannot be changed, it's pre-written"
03-06-2018T02:40:45,Bgrmystr2,bleh
03-06-2018T02:41:24,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah that's good!
03-06-2018T02:41:46,unsteddyphoenix,I'd just ruin the pacing if I could mess with it
03-06-2018T02:42:07,Bgrmystr2,"yknow, I always thought those ""choose your own ending"" books that made you go to certain pages based on a choice or w/e"
03-06-2018T02:42:16,Dadrobit,"I mean, the same could be said for most forms of entertainment besides video games and arts&crafts."
03-06-2018T02:42:19,Bgrmystr2,"those were.. not REALLY interactive, but they were pretty nice"
03-06-2018T02:42:35,Bgrmystr2,I found them interesting
03-06-2018T02:42:56,unsteddyphoenix,Swhy I don't really like sandboxes anymore
03-06-2018T02:42:59,FenceEqualizer,"To answer your question, feel like I am listening to like book 5 or something as I have no idea what's going on"
03-06-2018T02:43:05,Bgrmystr2,and yeah I don't really get into a lot of entertainment
03-06-2018T02:43:26,unsteddyphoenix,Lose interest if the story is background
03-06-2018T02:43:31,Bgrmystr2,"I don't like being told stuff.. and having to just sit there and watch how something plays out, fuck all that noise"
03-06-2018T02:43:36,Bgrmystr2,let me fuck with it
03-06-2018T02:43:42,Bgrmystr2,throw a wrench into this mess
03-06-2018T02:43:48,Bgrmystr2,see what breaks
03-06-2018T02:43:52,Bgrmystr2,love all that
03-06-2018T02:44:16,Xexanoth,usnteddy it depends on how generic the quests are
03-06-2018T02:44:33,Xexanoth,"hated farcry 4, loved farcry 5 because shit was actually fleshed"
03-06-2018T02:44:38,Xexanoth,out
03-06-2018T02:46:15,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, if I ever played any of the farcry games, I'd only play them to shoot things in the fac"
03-06-2018T02:46:17,Bgrmystr2,face*
03-06-2018T02:46:20,FenceEqualizer,Okay Yeah it's the house Atreides which is a prelude to the original dune.
03-06-2018T02:46:24,Bgrmystr2,and ignore the story almost entirely
03-06-2018T02:47:00,Xexanoth,"well, in farcry 5 the story comes to you...literally XD"
03-06-2018T02:47:10,Bgrmystr2,"bah, shoot it in the face too"
03-06-2018T02:47:15,Bgrmystr2,&gt;:V
03-06-2018T02:47:31,Xexanoth,as in whenever you unlock the next story mission by shooting enough stuff in the face you're kidnapped and forced to play it
03-06-2018T02:47:36,Bgrmystr2,"everyone in town turns on me, then kill everyone and loot the place clean"
03-06-2018T02:48:01,Bgrmystr2,aw man xex that's boring tho
03-06-2018T02:48:01,Bgrmystr2,:(
03-06-2018T02:48:24,Xexanoth,it's the only bad thing about farcry 5
03-06-2018T02:48:47,FenceEqualizer,I'll always love open world games though with that said everything doesn't need to be open world
03-06-2018T02:49:06,FenceEqualizer,glares at dynasty warriors 9.
03-06-2018T02:49:22,Xexanoth,lol
03-06-2018T02:49:24,Bgrmystr2,I played one of the dynasty warriors w/ a friend of mine
03-06-2018T02:49:28,Bgrmystr2,some girl with two fans
03-06-2018T02:49:31,Bgrmystr2,smacked everyone around me
03-06-2018T02:49:56,Bgrmystr2,I was just playing to sneak into their base and get to killin their doods
03-06-2018T02:50:03,Bgrmystr2,while he did the story shit
03-06-2018T02:50:31,Xexanoth,"the best part of the ""Warriors"" series, is that it has like 3 different ""easy"" difficulties and then the ""fuck you because you never needed to bother to actually learn the game"" difficulty"
03-06-2018T02:50:57,Bgrmystr2,xD
03-06-2018T02:51:27,FenceEqualizer,It's mindless fun in all honesty and always play on f you mode
03-06-2018T02:52:22,Dadrobit,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZr_-BLFIX8 The audiobook has an excerpt here, but the link to the full one is dead..."
03-06-2018T02:53:05,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
03-06-2018T02:53:23,Bgrmystr2,I could see myself listening to audiobooks while doing something else
03-06-2018T02:53:40,Bgrmystr2,not sure if I'd remember tho.. cuz it'd just turn into background noise
03-06-2018T02:53:43,Bgrmystr2,like my music does
03-06-2018T02:53:55,FenceEqualizer,Oh yeah saw that one but skipped it over cause it was 4 mins
03-06-2018T02:54:15,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, I've tried audio books but I lose focus and like, a page will go by without me listening"
03-06-2018T02:54:17,Xexanoth,that's why i can't listen to audiobooks... 5mins in im like* wait what happened*
03-06-2018T02:54:53,unsteddyphoenix,"It's sad cause I WANNA do it, but yeah exactly that"
03-06-2018T02:54:55,FenceEqualizer,Sweet sweet background noise
03-06-2018T02:55:01,Dadrobit,"Only time I listen to audiobooks is for road trips, and the occasionally when working out."
03-06-2018T02:55:15,Dadrobit,and occasionally*
03-06-2018T02:55:34,Bgrmystr2,"that's literally me reading books too, phoenix, so.. it won't be any different in my case heh"
03-06-2018T02:55:47,Dadrobit,"Otherwise, I lose it as well, and I want to not lose it."
03-06-2018T02:55:58,FenceEqualizer,Hurry up automated cars. Would auto pilot all day long while listening to audio books
03-06-2018T02:56:01,Bgrmystr2,I don't pay attention unless it catches my interest either way.. for the most part
03-06-2018T02:56:05,Xexanoth,lol...how do you manage to do that with books?
03-06-2018T02:56:18,Xexanoth,you're literally staring at it XD
03-06-2018T02:56:24,Bgrmystr2,I don't read them
03-06-2018T02:56:27,Bgrmystr2,that's how I manage it.
03-06-2018T02:56:29,Bgrmystr2,:)
03-06-2018T02:56:37,Xexanoth,fair point
03-06-2018T02:56:37,FenceEqualizer,Brain skins parts that are deemed fluff
03-06-2018T02:56:45,FenceEqualizer,Skims*
03-06-2018T02:56:56,Bgrmystr2,"I start reading a book, don't like it, take a break from it, go do somethin else, forget I was reading it, read a few more pages"
03-06-2018T02:57:00,Bgrmystr2,then get bored
03-06-2018T02:57:40,Xexanoth,"well, maybe one day you'll find the right book ^^"
03-06-2018T02:58:22,Bgrmystr2,"if I'm not looking at books to read, then may be difficult"
03-06-2018T02:58:57,Bgrmystr2,but maybe one day..
03-06-2018T02:58:58,Xexanoth,details :ptv-laugh:
03-06-2018T02:59:05,Bgrmystr2,haha
03-06-2018T03:02:01,unsteddyphoenix,Well thats another reason to start working out I guess
03-06-2018T03:02:06,unsteddyphoenix,Catch up on my reading
03-06-2018T03:02:38,FenceEqualizer,To listen to star ship troopers on audio while doing reps?
03-06-2018T03:03:04,Dadrobit,Would you like to know more?
03-06-2018T03:03:12,unsteddyphoenix,exactly
03-06-2018T03:04:47,Dadrobit,"To be honest, that's the one Heinlein novel I kind of never want to read."
03-06-2018T03:05:00,Dadrobit,"I fucking love the movie, and I don't want to taint that in any way."
03-06-2018T03:05:05,FenceEqualizer,The book is boring
03-06-2018T03:05:18,unsteddyphoenix,youmean theres a movie thats better than the book?
03-06-2018T03:05:41,FenceEqualizer,I red it twice and it does not capture the feel of the movie.
03-06-2018T03:05:47,FenceEqualizer,Read
03-06-2018T03:06:03,Xexanoth,movies being better than the book happen
03-06-2018T03:06:27,unsteddyphoenix,madness
03-06-2018T03:06:34,Xexanoth,"great example: Ready Player One...then again, the book kinda sucks imo"
03-06-2018T03:06:46,Dadrobit,"A Clockwork Orange, Silence of the Lambs, The Godfather..."
03-06-2018T03:06:54,FenceEqualizer,"Well to be fair, I was like 14. So can't quite channel the action"
03-06-2018T03:07:02,Dadrobit,2001 A Space Odyssey
03-06-2018T03:07:30,Dadrobit,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
03-06-2018T03:07:50,Xexanoth,hmm i wonder about The Shining
03-06-2018T03:08:00,Xexanoth,"because i only ever saw the movie, and that's tough to beat"
03-06-2018T03:08:05,unsteddyphoenix,Im sure there are a bunch of nerds that would argue with you
03-06-2018T03:08:14,unsteddyphoenix,space odyssey man....that was a movie
03-06-2018T03:08:52,Dadrobit,Legitimately my favorite movie of all time.
03-06-2018T03:09:27,unsteddyphoenix,really
03-06-2018T03:09:29,unsteddyphoenix,hm fair
03-06-2018T03:09:31,unsteddyphoenix,I can see it
03-06-2018T03:09:47,Dadrobit,"Which sounds kind of pretentious, but man, when I got to see it in theatre, it was actually incredible."
03-06-2018T03:11:40,unsteddyphoenix,"its like, the ""correct"" answer amongst hipster"
03-06-2018T03:11:42,unsteddyphoenix,for best movie
03-06-2018T03:12:28,Dadrobit,"Like, I had seen it before at home and thought it was alright, but something about going and actually seeing it at the movies. It does something crazy for that film."
03-06-2018T03:12:55,Dadrobit,When the intermission happens and you just kinda sit there enraptured for a bit before you get up.
03-06-2018T03:13:00,Xexanoth,I would love to see that movie in Imax
03-06-2018T03:14:04,FenceEqualizer,Hal did nothing wrong
03-06-2018T03:15:13,Dadrobit,They're actually doing a showing of a 70mm remaster in select theatres starting this month.
03-06-2018T03:15:58,Dadrobit,"Actually, not remastered, they're not touching it up at all."
03-06-2018T03:16:39,Dadrobit,"""For the first time since the original release, this 70mm print was struck from new printing elements made from the original camera negative. This is a true photochemical film recreation. There are no digital tricks, remastered effects, or revisionist"
03-06-2018T03:16:41,Dadrobit,"edits. This is the unrestored film - that recreates the cinematic event that audiences experienced fifty years ago."""
03-06-2018T03:18:01,FenceEqualizer,Wait is that actually happening? Space odyssey being played in 70mm?
03-06-2018T03:18:20,Xexanoth,"speaking of movies, watched Solo this weekend, so far Disney is 2 for 2 for making the Side movies better than the main movies"
03-06-2018T03:18:26,Dadrobit,"Yep, get tickets here https://www.2001spaceodysseymovie.com/"
03-06-2018T03:20:01,FenceEqualizer,F******!
03-06-2018T03:20:25,FenceEqualizer,I am going to miss something awesome!
03-06-2018T03:21:43,Dadrobit,I'm going to a showing that's only a few miles away at a Harkins. It's gonna be baller.
03-06-2018T03:21:57,FenceEqualizer,Hdjfneifna
03-06-2018T03:22:24,Dadrobit,Sorry....
03-06-2018T03:23:00,FenceEqualizer,Wish this was happening a month from now too messed up to go. I'll risk retearing my ligaments if I go
03-06-2018T03:23:25,Dadrobit,":( Damn man, that blows."
03-06-2018T03:23:51,FenceEqualizer,Ehh how the cookie crumbles. I will just have to live bi curiously through your hype
03-06-2018T03:24:48,Dadrobit,LMAO
03-06-2018T03:26:20,FenceEqualizer,Though have to say this is awesome that they're bringing back this old movie like this.
03-06-2018T03:30:00,Xexanoth,if only it was available near me :ptv-unimpressed:
03-06-2018T03:33:04,FenceEqualizer,"Take it the closest theater is like an hour away, Xex?"
03-06-2018T03:34:04,Xexanoth,the closest theatre for that is a 10+ hour flight to another continent for me XD
03-06-2018T03:34:12,Xexanoth,"so yeah, not happening"
03-06-2018T03:34:24,FenceEqualizer,Oooo boy.
03-06-2018T03:36:17,Dadrobit,Well now. You might want to hold on to those expenses.
03-06-2018T03:36:56,Dadrobit,"Here, this is roughly the same experience as watching the movie https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeQi4zbT8fA"
03-06-2018T03:38:16,Xexanoth,the fuck
03-06-2018T03:39:49,FenceEqualizer,What In heavens name?! This must be the weird part of YouTube again
03-06-2018T03:41:10,unsteddyphoenix,ohh ive seen this
03-06-2018T03:41:12,unsteddyphoenix,big fan
03-06-2018T03:41:28,Dadrobit,"Yeah, pretty sure I linked it here before."
03-06-2018T03:43:37,Bgrmystr2,I REMEMBER THIS VIDEO
03-06-2018T03:43:38,Bgrmystr2,xDD
03-06-2018T03:44:24,FenceEqualizer,What the hell! :ptv-laugh:
03-06-2018T03:47:29,FenceEqualizer,That was worth a watch
03-06-2018T03:48:16,Dadrobit,Happy to provide!
03-06-2018T03:49:47,Xexanoth,it certainly was something...
03-06-2018T03:49:58,Bgrmystr2,I still go 'wat' at the end of this vid every time I watch it xD
03-06-2018T03:50:39,Dadrobit,The last half is literally all just one big 2001 ASO parody.
03-06-2018T03:51:28,Xexanoth,my favourite part was how bad the chocolate running down pudding animation was compared to the rest
03-06-2018T04:00:02,Twokinds,crap how is it 5am
03-06-2018T04:00:05,Twokinds,Where does the time go
03-06-2018T04:00:36,Dadrobit,Clockwise as I hear it.
03-06-2018T04:01:04,Twokinds,unlike unsteddy's
03-06-2018T04:01:22,Dadrobit,Damned time traveler.
03-06-2018T04:01:23,Bgrmystr2,yeah. his cloks are all upside down
03-06-2018T04:01:27,Bgrmystr2,from the future

03-06-2018T04:02:09,Dadrobit,THC mostly
03-06-2018T04:02:20,Bgrmystr2,I'm up till 5 or 6am every single day
03-06-2018T04:02:29,Bgrmystr2,"how are you not up till then, xex?"
03-06-2018T04:02:40,Bgrmystr2,"it's only 4am here, I still got an hour or so to go :)"
03-06-2018T04:02:55,Dadrobit,2:02
03-06-2018T04:04:30,Xexanoth,lol i had to stop watching the stream because i nearly pretty much fell asleep in my chair at 2am....that was 9 hours ago
03-06-2018T04:05:31,Xexanoth,"also bgr, that can't be healthy...."
03-06-2018T04:06:23,FenceEqualizer,"Night owls Xex, Night owls"
03-06-2018T04:06:44,Bgrmystr2,nothing's unhealthy about it xex
03-06-2018T04:07:08,Bgrmystr2,people only sleep at night because it's convenient to be awake during the hours of daylight to see
03-06-2018T04:07:14,Bgrmystr2,there's nothing more to it
03-06-2018T04:07:26,Bgrmystr2,I get just as much sleep if not moreso than other people who sleep at night
03-06-2018T04:09:22,Xexanoth,"and you know, stuff like work and school and stuff...."
03-06-2018T04:09:44,Bgrmystr2,"work at home, haven't gone to school in over prbably 12 years or so?"
03-06-2018T04:09:51,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
03-06-2018T04:15:30,unsteddyphoenix,I always naturally revert to nocturnal

03-06-2018T04:18:03,unsteddyphoenix,Of not having to leave the house ever
03-06-2018T04:18:29,Twokinds,Probably not healthy.
03-06-2018T04:18:38,unsteddyphoenix,YOURE probably not healthy
03-06-2018T04:18:42,Twokinds,"And no, I don't recognize that title."
03-06-2018T04:18:46,Dadrobit,"I mean, it's got perks, but it's not all sunshine."
03-06-2018T04:19:06,Dadrobit,"Turns home into work. If you wanna get away from work, it's not as easy as just going home ya know?"
03-06-2018T04:19:09,unsteddyphoenix,(I get it)
03-06-2018T04:19:34,unsteddyphoenix,"Well yeah, I get that"
03-06-2018T04:19:51,unsteddyphoenix,"In uni I always worked at home when I could though, and I can be productive there turns out"
03-06-2018T04:20:01,Dadrobit,Gotta go out and turn off the phone to get free.
03-06-2018T04:20:25,iliar,I suddenly thought that it could be used as a reference for Sam and Colin https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4frgZF04KbU/maxresdefault.jpg
03-06-2018T04:21:41,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
03-06-2018T04:21:48,unsteddyphoenix,Take a break by doing chores
03-06-2018T04:21:53,Xexanoth,"oh hey Iliar, superb choice for a Nora Card btw"
03-06-2018T04:22:00,Twokinds,That's very cute
03-06-2018T04:22:05,Bgrmystr2,"oooooh that's where they're from, iliar?"
03-06-2018T04:22:15,unsteddyphoenix,He big she smol
03-06-2018T04:22:15,Dadrobit,"Well, sure. Being productive even at home is just work ethic. Work ethic's 100% mandatory for working at home. It's way easy to shrug shit off when your games are three feet from your workstation. Figuring out when too much is too much when you're in it."
03-06-2018T04:22:19,Dadrobit,That's the issue.
03-06-2018T04:22:54,Dadrobit,"Also, highly adorable."
03-06-2018T04:23:12,unsteddyphoenix,Luckily I got just as distracted at uni as at home :ptv-dealwithit:
03-06-2018T04:23:18,Dadrobit,lol
03-06-2018T04:23:41,unsteddyphoenix,"But nah, if I actually have a ""job"" I tend to do it pretty responsibly. Anything creative I do for myself though..."
03-06-2018T04:23:53,iliar,@Bgrmystr2 It's from Grimoire of Zero / Zero kara Hajimeru Mahō no Sho / Starting the Magical Book from Zero
03-06-2018T04:24:01,Bgrmystr2,yeah I looked it up
03-06-2018T04:24:12,Bgrmystr2,:thumbsup: threw it on my watch list
03-06-2018T04:24:17,Bgrmystr2,been meaning to find that anyway
03-06-2018T04:24:39,Dadrobit,Mhmm. For sure. I started working on doing a total sound swap for the Death Stranding video a week or two ago.
03-06-2018T04:24:46,Dadrobit,Gotta have hobbies.
03-06-2018T04:26:01,unsteddyphoenix,thats pretty cool~
03-06-2018T04:27:06,Dadrobit,"Making it all 100% from scratch, recording it all on a Zoom H5 recorder to see what I can do on a super minimal budget."
03-06-2018T04:27:13,Dadrobit,No pre-recorded audio at all.
03-06-2018T04:28:02,Dadrobit,"Fun so far, hoping for the best."
03-06-2018T04:28:14,unsteddyphoenix,Found some good baby sounds?
03-06-2018T04:28:51,Dadrobit,I'm banking on my ability to modulate my voice to approximate something fitting a baby.
03-06-2018T04:28:56,unsteddyphoenix,Omg
03-06-2018T04:28:59,unsteddyphoenix,Send me that clip

03-06-2018T04:29:45,Dadrobit,"For now, I just have the baby twirling in it's umbilical egg."
03-06-2018T04:30:01,Dadrobit,Made with a condom half distended with water.
03-06-2018T04:30:18,Dadrobit,It works pretty well.
03-06-2018T04:30:42,Dadrobit,The source irony is a pretty big bonus.
03-06-2018T04:31:54,Dadrobit,Got a good hour of recording horror sfx in my bathroom with a guitar and a metal ruler for lots of ambient/monster noises.
03-06-2018T04:32:22,unsteddyphoenix,thats how they made zac
03-06-2018T04:32:24,unsteddyphoenix,from lols sounds

03-06-2018T04:32:41,Dadrobit,Really? That's amazing.
03-06-2018T04:33:20,Dadrobit,"I was gonna use a balloon, but I didn't have any on hand. And it's not like the Trojans were seeing any use otherwise..."
03-06-2018T04:35:03,Dadrobit,Is there a video/article on the making of League sfx?
03-06-2018T04:39:09,unsteddyphoenix,yeah I think so
03-06-2018T04:39:12,unsteddyphoenix,Old ones at least
03-06-2018T04:43:27,Dadrobit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYECsixOR3E Found Kobe and Phreak talking about it.
03-06-2018T04:46:17,Dadrobit,"They talk about a post talking about them, but in searching, all I can find are sound rips, and bug reports of audio not working...."
03-06-2018T04:51:10,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah it's pretty old content I guess
03-06-2018T04:54:14,Dadrobit,:( I love watching extras stuff like that.
03-06-2018T04:55:38,unsteddyphoenix,Me too
03-06-2018T04:55:41,unsteddyphoenix,They used to do more~
03-06-2018T04:57:06,unsteddyphoenix,Fuck I used to have this game that had an entire like 1.5 hours documentary on the making of it
03-06-2018T04:57:11,unsteddyphoenix,Oh It was Mortal Kombat
03-06-2018T04:57:54,Dadrobit,Lol
03-06-2018T04:58:37,Bgrmystr2,"back, finally got my 3d empire state building puzzle back put together"
03-06-2018T04:58:38,Dadrobit,I'm the guy that actually seeks out the special features section of the movie.
03-06-2018T04:58:59,Bgrmystr2,"gonna prolly head to bed I guess, Feels a bit early but it's okay"
03-06-2018T04:59:42,Bgrmystr2,you guys have a good night :)
03-06-2018T05:00:04,Dadrobit,Night bgr.
03-06-2018T05:00:10,unsteddyphoenix,gnight
03-06-2018T05:00:19,Dadrobit,The FF Kingsglaive movie had a pretty decent one.
03-06-2018T05:00:33,Dadrobit,And that Kong movie that came out a few years back.
03-06-2018T05:00:38,Dadrobit,The one with Jack Black.
03-06-2018T05:01:19,unsteddyphoenix,Ah yeah I heard of that
03-06-2018T05:01:56,unsteddyphoenix,Never watched it
03-06-2018T05:02:06,unsteddyphoenix,'cause the other King Kong was a 3 hour nightmare
03-06-2018T05:02:23,Dadrobit,"Same, I've only ever watched the special features part of it lol."
03-06-2018T05:03:01,unsteddyphoenix,:ok_hand:
03-06-2018T05:05:50,Dadrobit,It actually has a 2.5 hour documentary on it's post-production.
03-06-2018T05:16:43,FenceEqualizer,King King wasn't that bad during the island segments. Crud had some real horror element to it
03-06-2018T05:16:58,FenceEqualizer,King Kong*
03-06-2018T05:18:09,Dadrobit,"Ah, that's because it was in New Zealand. You'd be hard pressed to find a shot there that you don't like."
03-06-2018T05:18:20,Dadrobit,Ask the Lord of the Rings
03-06-2018T05:20:28,FenceEqualizer,"You got me there, If New Zealand has one thing it's scenery."
03-06-2018T05:21:33,unsteddyphoenix,pretty much yeah
03-06-2018T05:21:35,unsteddyphoenix,we got a thing
03-06-2018T05:23:28,Dadrobit,2. You have rugby.
03-06-2018T05:26:41,unsteddyphoenix,! you right
03-06-2018T05:26:47,unsteddyphoenix,win by default cause noone else cares :D
03-06-2018T05:28:05,Dadrobit,I think America won a cup a year or two ago. Literally no one here cares...
03-06-2018T05:30:31,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah
03-06-2018T05:30:33,unsteddyphoenix,Just us
03-06-2018T05:30:36,unsteddyphoenix,And sometimes australia
03-06-2018T05:30:40,unsteddyphoenix,But mostly us
03-06-2018T05:30:51,unsteddyphoenix,We'd never win someting america cared about~
03-06-2018T05:31:06,Dadrobit,Oh man...
03-06-2018T05:31:41,Dadrobit,You've won the adoration of American tourists at least! (At the cost of your own cost of living)
03-06-2018T05:31:58,unsteddyphoenix,Eh tourism keeps us afloat
03-06-2018T05:33:32,Dadrobit,That's kind of how AZ operates actually. Every winter the snowbirds fly/drive into AZ and give us their money.
03-06-2018T05:33:50,FenceEqualizer,And you have affordable living serious $300 for a two bedroom apartment nice
03-06-2018T05:33:54,Dadrobit,"Otherwise all we have is copper, Boeing, and a big hole in the ground."
03-06-2018T05:34:37,FenceEqualizer,AZ also has blistering heat.
03-06-2018T05:34:49,Dadrobit,"Ah, yes. There is that."
03-06-2018T05:35:01,unsteddyphoenix,thats that shit I dont like
03-06-2018T05:35:19,Dadrobit,Opening your door is like opening your oven with your face too close. Except then we have to walk into it.
03-06-2018T05:35:49,Dadrobit,I actually went outside today in the midday. Fucking mistake.
03-06-2018T05:36:29,unsteddyphoenix,I bet your air conditioning really good though
03-06-2018T05:36:43,unsteddyphoenix,as a result
03-06-2018T05:36:50,Dadrobit,High of 109. Was a bad time.
03-06-2018T05:37:06,FenceEqualizer,I was thinking more like this
03-06-2018T05:37:06,Dadrobit,"Nah, I use a swamp cooler for the most part."
03-06-2018T05:37:10,FenceEqualizer,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0TVaJACrZs
03-06-2018T05:37:18,unsteddyphoenix,Oh the thign that sucks out the humidity?
03-06-2018T05:37:41,unsteddyphoenix,Aaa nooo~
03-06-2018T05:38:10,unsteddyphoenix,Ive been in 105F heat in Italy before. It was hell.
03-06-2018T05:38:28,unsteddyphoenix,We just laid around all day trying to survive until the evening when we could move
03-06-2018T05:39:09,Dadrobit,Swamp coolers actually pump cooled humid air into the house. They stop working as well when it's naturally humid.
03-06-2018T05:39:31,Dadrobit,Then you turn on your A/C and watch as the electric bill triples.
03-06-2018T05:39:52,Dadrobit,"""I only had the A/C cooling to 85 though!"""
03-06-2018T05:39:53,unsteddyphoenix,"Ohh I see, interesting"
03-06-2018T05:40:27,Dadrobit,July is hell for the electric bill with monsoons
03-06-2018T05:41:07,Dadrobit,"Even when it's not raining, it just get's humid at 115 and the A/C is fucking mandatory."
03-06-2018T05:41:13,Dadrobit,gets*
03-06-2018T05:41:32,unsteddyphoenix,God
03-06-2018T05:41:36,unsteddyphoenix,How does anyone get anything done
03-06-2018T05:42:32,Dadrobit,You don't.
03-06-2018T05:42:33,FenceEqualizer,According to roommate doing crap at night to avoid heat.
03-06-2018T05:42:47,Dadrobit,You go to the movies or a water park.
03-06-2018T05:43:13,unsteddyphoenix,good way to become a film buff
03-06-2018T05:43:17,Dadrobit,Otherwise you stay inside with an ice pack on your face.
03-06-2018T05:43:25,unsteddyphoenix,sounds about right
03-06-2018T05:43:49,Dadrobit,Or you take a warm shower/bath.
03-06-2018T05:43:56,Xexanoth,you people make me glad i don't have to deal with stuff like that
03-06-2018T05:44:08,Dadrobit,Because good luck getting water out of the pipes that's anything approximating cold.
03-06-2018T05:45:09,Dadrobit,"Already I haven't touched the ""hot water"" tap in my shower for a month. Don't need it when the ""cold"" tap is just fine."
03-06-2018T05:45:28,FenceEqualizer,That is nuts.
03-06-2018T05:47:25,Dadrobit,Ignore the rest https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIl7w_k_t0&t=0m13s
03-06-2018T05:47:53,unsteddyphoenix,nope.avi
03-06-2018T05:51:26,Dadrobit,Who doesn't like heat that can result in crispy bacon by 10 in the morning?
03-06-2018T05:51:33,Dadrobit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RwPZm3KW-8
03-06-2018T05:52:43,unsteddyphoenix,At...least that's energy efficient!@
03-06-2018T05:54:28,Dadrobit,"Yeah, and because the asphalt melts every summer, the roads are all self-healing!"
03-06-2018T05:55:49,unsteddyphoenix,lol
03-06-2018T05:55:58,unsteddyphoenix,Well thats just convenient
03-06-2018T05:56:23,unsteddyphoenix,The more I hear about it seems ok
03-06-2018T05:56:33,unsteddyphoenix,J/K IT SOUNDS AWFUL
03-06-2018T05:56:57,Dadrobit,It's convenient until you track asphalt into your house and have to scrub the tar off of your tile.
03-06-2018T05:57:05,Dadrobit,Lord help you if you have carpet.
03-06-2018T05:57:24,Xexanoth,why do you people live in a place that's clearly not meant for people to live there?
03-06-2018T05:57:41,unsteddyphoenix,"Agreed, you should all leave in summer"
03-06-2018T05:57:47,Dadrobit,The Mexican food's pretty great tho
03-06-2018T05:58:45,Dadrobit,"I think there's a King of the Hill reference there, xex, no?"
03-06-2018T05:59:14,Xexanoth,"Probably, it's some cartoon series ^^"
03-06-2018T05:59:37,Dadrobit,"Ah, found it, was thinking it was more similar than it is"
03-06-2018T05:59:39,Dadrobit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PYt0SDnrBE
03-06-2018T06:08:03,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah thats basically my sentiment
03-06-2018T06:10:30,FenceEqualizer,"Time too pass out, You guys have a goodnight."
03-06-2018T06:11:02,Dadrobit,o/ Fence
03-06-2018T06:15:18,Dadrobit,"To be honest, there are is a ton of space in AZ that's totally temperate and hospitable. But most of the state is considered pretested wilderness or is part of a reservation."
03-06-2018T06:15:24,Dadrobit,there is*
03-06-2018T06:15:32,Dadrobit,protected*
03-06-2018T06:16:24,Dadrobit,"And 95% of the state lives in Phoenix or the Phoenix metro area where it's less than ideal, so that's the image we get."
03-06-2018T10:36:40,Trevuxnouxe,i just watch the x20 stream and i already colored 1st and 2nd place
03-06-2018T10:38:36,Trevuxnouxe,wow the 3rd winner was amazing!
03-06-2018T10:40:06,Trevuxnouxe,i had a sketch version of 5th that i was going to color but figured it was too hard.
03-06-2018T11:49:00,SiliconCarbide,"wait what, did aurora actually get colored?"
03-06-2018T11:49:06,SiliconCarbide,oh wow it did
03-06-2018T11:49:10,SiliconCarbide,haha thats amazing
03-06-2018T11:49:13,SiliconCarbide,how did that happen ^^
03-06-2018T12:01:02,SiliconCarbide,"and it turned out so pretty, nice"
03-06-2018T12:02:19,Trevuxnouxe,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDFYOQCZxwM 1st
03-06-2018T12:04:19,Trevuxnouxe,i didn't mean 2nd i meant 3rd. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsjfgnNcI9w&t=2s 3rd
03-06-2018T13:57:42,Twokinds,Neat!
03-06-2018T13:57:49,Twokinds,"All one layer, huh? That's tricky"
03-06-2018T14:18:53,BadFoMo,One layer!? I'm reminded of my MS Paint days.
03-06-2018T14:21:31,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-sleepy: gmornin
03-06-2018T14:51:29,Trevuxnouxe,"good morning, I only use an app on my tablet, i dont want to pay for adobe stuff."
03-06-2018T14:54:08,Trevuxnouxe,i never thought of using more than one layer...
03-06-2018T15:47:41,Twokinds,"I wasn't satisfied with the background of the subtleseed pic, so I ended up redoing it... and then the whole thing"
03-06-2018T15:56:11,Dadrobit,"Hahahaha, oh boy."
03-06-2018T15:58:02,Dadrobit,"Had that kind of happen on my last sound design project, the For Honor one. Spent a good three weeks at the beginning struggling with my mix. Ended up scrapping nearly the whole damned thing."
03-06-2018T16:00:52,Dadrobit,"Huh, that's odd. The download for the original subtleseed picture isn't working."
03-06-2018T16:00:57,Dadrobit,Mayb it's just me?
03-06-2018T16:01:01,Dadrobit,Maybe*
03-06-2018T16:01:24,Twokinds,It's working for me
03-06-2018T16:01:35,Dadrobit,It's not saving as a png for me.
03-06-2018T16:01:56,Twokinds,Have you tried refreshing?
03-06-2018T16:02:23,Dadrobit,"Yeah, and clearing my browser."
03-06-2018T16:02:38,Twokinds,"Well, I dunno"
03-06-2018T16:02:58,Dadrobit,"It's saving it as a ""File""... Why thank you properties tab, your information is invaluable."
03-06-2018T16:03:28,Dadrobit,"Lemme restart everything, see if my computer's just on the fritz."
03-06-2018T16:03:43,Trevuxnouxe,seeing your versions of colored sketches i colored before you makes me want to sit and try even harder. but i dont have the patients
03-06-2018T16:06:07,Trevuxnouxe,i can save a png
03-06-2018T16:28:05,Dadrobit,There we go. Got it working now.
03-06-2018T16:28:42,Dadrobit,I'm guessing that my computer is probably unhappy with me for leaving it open with hundreds of tabs running all of the time.
03-06-2018T16:30:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"“For the love of God, let me rest!”"
03-06-2018T16:31:18,Dadrobit,"""Oh, that looks like a useful thing, I'll just leave that open in a new tab for later."
03-06-2018T16:31:20,Dadrobit,""""
03-06-2018T16:32:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Have you ever considered using bookmarks for that kinda thing
03-06-2018T16:34:55,Dadrobit,"Sure, I'll add it to one of my dozens and dozens of bookmarks."
03-06-2018T16:35:55,Dadrobit,Generally I try to only add stuff to bookmarks when I find that something is actually a valuable resource.
03-06-2018T17:30:03,Twokinds,Anyone here familiar with Indian food?
03-06-2018T17:55:34,Trevuxnouxe,"no, but i want to try it"
03-06-2018T18:01:43,CrRAR,I enjoy indian food from time to time. I usually get Biryani's
03-06-2018T18:02:17,CrRAR,It's like the safest dish you can get... basically a spicy stir fry. With chicken or beef or shrimp

03-06-2018T18:04:38,CrRAR,uhhhh lol The place I get it at doesn't add cashews.
03-06-2018T18:04:45,CrRAR,Peas though.
03-06-2018T18:07:07,CrRAR,"The cucumber/yogurt sauces are pretty good, mostly any sauces."

03-06-2018T18:40:07,CrRAR,Tom did you order any food? Possibly Indian food?
03-06-2018T18:56:26,Twokinds,I was going to but decided to starve instead
03-06-2018T19:00:13,CrRAR,bu.. but that just means more food for OTHER PEOPLE.
03-06-2018T19:00:30,CrRAR,How could you be so... considerate!?

03-06-2018T21:09:25,CrRAR,I had that original one where she painted em as my desktop for the longest time.
03-06-2018T21:10:26,CrRAR,ahhhhh the nostalgia &lt;3
03-06-2018T21:11:14,CrRAR,plus the pink ties in good with... erhem... certain other effects... in the room.
03-06-2018T21:11:28,unsteddyphoenix,When WAS the first time she painted them?

03-06-2018T21:18:37,unsteddyphoenix,That one she like...looked different
03-06-2018T21:19:05,unsteddyphoenix,Ah yeah she had a chest floof and no bewbs.

03-06-2018T21:22:34,CrRAR,That was a interesting phase. Right around Rooby time.

03-06-2018T21:34:10,unsteddyphoenix,I see no evidence of this from inside my house
03-06-2018T21:34:15,unsteddyphoenix,Therefore it must be false

03-06-2018T22:41:43,unsteddyphoenix,Score!
03-06-2018T22:43:42,unsteddyphoenix,Do you often get to take stuff home from Walmart?
03-06-2018T22:44:09,SpazztasticKiwi,When I shop yea
03-06-2018T22:44:37,unsteddyphoenix,...guess I walked into that one
03-06-2018T22:45:50,SpazztasticKiwi,We do kinda get free samples though

03-06-2018T22:50:57,SpazztasticKiwi,And we sell this cookies n cream mousse that’s basically oreo flavored whipped cream

03-06-2018T22:52:14,unsteddyphoenix,Cream
03-06-2018T22:52:24,unsteddyphoenix,That's genius though
03-06-2018T22:52:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve tried that stuff
03-06-2018T22:52:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Better company than a boyfriend
03-06-2018T22:53:35,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah that's probably true
03-06-2018T22:53:57,unsteddyphoenix,Netflix and Oreos
03-06-2018T22:54:11,SpazztasticKiwi,But dear God the amount of sugar in that stuff. Instant diabetes
03-06-2018T22:55:55,unsteddyphoenix,"Every American product I've ever had has been a sugar overload, so."
03-06-2018T22:56:02,SpazztasticKiwi,My manager bought two tubs of the stuff when we first got it
03-06-2018T22:56:24,SpazztasticKiwi,About a pint each per tub
03-06-2018T22:57:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I liked it pretty well too but I’m more of a chocolate person myself
03-06-2018T22:58:19,Dadrobit,Not everything American has sugar in it. Honest!
03-06-2018T22:58:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Just 90%
03-06-2018T22:59:00,Dadrobit,Ford and Chevy doesn't. Heck. Put sugar in those and they die.
03-06-2018T22:59:46,SpazztasticKiwi,And GMC...?
03-06-2018T22:59:53,unsteddyphoenix,You got me there
03-06-2018T23:00:15,unsteddyphoenix,Gasoline has a lot of calories though
03-06-2018T23:00:24,Dadrobit,"And Buic, and Cadilac, and Jeep, and Dodge, and Chrysler."
03-06-2018T23:00:33,Dadrobit,Buick*
03-06-2018T23:00:50,Dadrobit,Cadillac*
03-06-2018T23:00:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Gasoline has enough calories that you drink it once and you never have to eat again
03-06-2018T23:01:06,unsteddyphoenix,Now that's a diet plan
03-06-2018T23:01:20,Dadrobit,Anything is a lifetime supply if you eat enough of it.
03-06-2018T23:01:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"Hey Tom, I got a diet secret for you..."
03-06-2018T23:02:09,Dadrobit,I wonder how a Tesla reacts to sugar?
03-06-2018T23:02:18,SpazztasticKiwi,(Don’t actually - “man slaughter” is not a charge I need)
03-06-2018T23:02:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Teslas are recharge only aren’t they
03-06-2018T23:02:43,unsteddyphoenix,Probably changes colour or something
03-06-2018T23:03:05,unsteddyphoenix,I wouldn't put it past musk to put Easter eggs in his cars
03-06-2018T23:03:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Those cars are pretty but they don’t have a very strong frame
03-06-2018T23:04:18,Dadrobit,"I like the idea, I want it to succeed. Not sold on the longevity of the vehicle."
03-06-2018T23:04:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera is rubbing his face on the phone for attention
03-06-2018T23:05:13,Dadrobit,Batteries degrade over time. And those are a huge part of the cost. Don't want to spend a large % of the car every 10 years just to maintain it.
03-06-2018T23:05:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Too fancy for my taste
03-06-2018T23:05:58,unsteddyphoenix,But isn't buying gas basically that
03-06-2018T23:06:13,unsteddyphoenix,Also gib attention
03-06-2018T23:06:26,Dadrobit,Still costs money to charge a Tesla. They're not free to charge.
03-06-2018T23:06:50,Dadrobit,"Unless you pay an exorbitant price up front to use their ""free"" charge station."
03-06-2018T23:07:09,unsteddyphoenix,"""""""""???"
03-06-2018T23:07:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve seen a recharge station. We have one in Tupelo near the movie theater
03-06-2018T23:07:54,Dadrobit,I think we actually have a dealership not to far away from here.
03-06-2018T23:07:59,SpazztasticKiwi,It looks like a gas station without a building. Just little ⛽️ ports
03-06-2018T23:08:54,unsteddyphoenix,I'm not sure we have them here yet
03-06-2018T23:08:59,Dadrobit,Nearest charge station to me is 34 miles away.
03-06-2018T23:09:00,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds futury
03-06-2018T23:09:20,Dadrobit,Otherwise the charging just happens at home and you watch your electric bill rise.
03-06-2018T23:09:50,unsteddyphoenix,How expensive is it though
03-06-2018T23:10:17,unsteddyphoenix,I assume it's still cheaper than gas
03-06-2018T23:12:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark has live-streamed while recharging his S model. Had to look the car up cause I’ve never really seen a Tesla
03-06-2018T23:12:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I think he said it was the S
03-06-2018T23:13:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"But anyway, that car is fine looking but it reminds me of that guy in high school that was always checking his hair in the mirror"
03-06-2018T23:15:07,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
03-06-2018T23:15:09,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it'll likely be cheaper depending on your kw/hr rates vs gas price, but there's also the installation fee for putting the charger in your home."
03-06-2018T23:16:11,Dadrobit,Finding citations of $1500-$2000 to install it.
03-06-2018T23:17:53,unsteddyphoenix,Hmm. Probably convenient fueling up at your house?
03-06-2018T23:18:25,Dadrobit,"Sure, absolutely it would be."
03-06-2018T23:18:42,unsteddyphoenix,I'm just assuming it's worth it in some way
03-06-2018T23:19:00,unsteddyphoenix,Cars are hard
03-06-2018T23:19:36,Dadrobit,"Don't get me wrong, I want this stuff to succeed, I'd fucking love to have a Tesla. But the barrier to entry, and the unavoidable natural degradation of the vehicle is too offputting for me to seriously consider one."
03-06-2018T23:20:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m looking for something that’s got a tougher frame
03-06-2018T23:21:01,SpazztasticKiwi,And doesn’t require me to sell a few organs to get
03-06-2018T23:21:26,unsteddyphoenix,"Lol yeah, that's the main thing"
03-06-2018T23:22:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve been eyeing this Jeep at my local dealership
03-06-2018T23:22:11,Dadrobit,"At 30 miles a day, 5 days a week, it'd take about 2 years to pay off just the installation fee for the home charger from their online calculator."
03-06-2018T23:22:29,Dadrobit,In gas savings
03-06-2018T23:22:41,SpazztasticKiwi,#notworthit?
03-06-2018T23:23:19,Dadrobit,"Also, consider that the company is in the red in a really terrible way."
03-06-2018T23:23:34,unsteddyphoenix,It is?
03-06-2018T23:23:44,Dadrobit,And they require that you bring it to a Tesla service center for maintenance.
03-06-2018T23:24:03,Dadrobit,"Oh yeah, they survive solely off the govt."
03-06-2018T23:24:24,unsteddyphoenix,And their flamethrower sales
03-06-2018T23:24:26,Dadrobit,Because their production rate is terribad.
03-06-2018T23:26:27,Dadrobit,And Elon is showing some bad signs in terms of dealing with it. Blowing off revenue questions in shareholder conference calls.
03-06-2018T23:27:07,Dadrobit,It's hauntingly reminiscent of the CEO of Enron's attitude towards shareholders just before they went under.
03-06-2018T23:27:43,unsteddyphoenix,Things went enwrong
03-06-2018T23:28:24,unsteddyphoenix,I feel like musk is one frustrating conference call from going full blown supervillain
03-06-2018T23:28:37,unsteddyphoenix,He's already eccentric enough
03-06-2018T23:29:17,Dadrobit,"""Boring bonehead questions are not cool. We're going to go to YouTube. Sorry. These questions are so dry. They're killing me."""
03-06-2018T23:30:15,Dadrobit,"Like, that's not how you handle a question from a guy that's financially supporting you, asking how you're using his money."
03-06-2018T23:31:05,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
