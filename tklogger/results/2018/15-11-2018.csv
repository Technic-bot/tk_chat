15-11-2018T00:02:47,Vatruvius,"A voran discovers her parents vanished and sets out to find them, instead she finds something far more unsettling."
15-11-2018T00:03:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Bah bah baaaaaaaa

15-11-2018T00:04:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Wrong baa
15-11-2018T00:05:02,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs the dramatic drum roll bah bah baaa
15-11-2018T00:06:51,SpazztasticKiwi,A summary is where it starts. Now you have to work out aaall the fun bits around it
15-11-2018T00:07:15,Vatruvius,I have done a lot of that. Took me a while to condense it into a summary statement like that one.
15-11-2018T00:07:22,Vatruvius,And it is just a rough version at that.
15-11-2018T00:07:40,Vatruvius,But I needed it to help me focus my efforts because I was starting to go all over the place.
15-11-2018T00:08:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"A problem I see though is if that‚Äôs the only or first statement someone sees, a voran is a species you made up for this universe, yes?"
15-11-2018T00:09:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Readers aren‚Äôt gonna know that goin in. So that‚Äôs gonna cause some confusin
15-11-2018T00:10:53,Vatruvius,This statement is more so for me help guide my creativity if that makes sense. I will come up with a far better statement as a hook for people first seeing the webcomic.
15-11-2018T00:11:17,Vatruvius,"For instance, instead of "" A voran"" I could use the character's name, Amber."

15-11-2018T00:12:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Have fun
15-11-2018T00:13:40,Vatruvius,The whole process of figuring out a story statement has clarified a few things for me. Things that could have really messed up the webcomic had I not done this.
15-11-2018T00:13:53,Vatruvius,"Maybe I would have caught it later on, but I think it is better catching it now."
15-11-2018T00:15:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"Good, good. You getting more comfortable with the what and how you‚Äôre thinking?"
15-11-2018T00:16:08,Vatruvius,"Absolutely, though I have to say it is really hard trying to come up with ""scenes"" when at the same time I am world building."
15-11-2018T00:16:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"Well, it‚Äôs step by step. There is progress"
15-11-2018T00:16:34,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs what‚Äôs important
15-11-2018T00:16:50,SpazztasticKiwi,PROgress. The best kind of gress
15-11-2018T00:17:12,Vatruvius,lol
15-11-2018T00:21:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll be honest. I was hoping someone would ask ‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs the worse kind of -gress?‚Äù
15-11-2018T00:22:03,SpazztasticKiwi,And I‚Äôd say ‚ÄúCongress‚Äù

15-11-2018T00:22:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Bad joke. Never mind it
15-11-2018T00:22:31,Vatruvius,lol
15-11-2018T00:22:37,Vatruvius,It was a pun...
15-11-2018T00:23:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I like puns ok
15-11-2018T00:23:31,SpazztasticKiwi,They bring people together
15-11-2018T00:23:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Either in mobs or in laughter but they bring people together nonetheless
15-11-2018T00:25:02,Vatruvius,"I am not saying they are bad, I participate in a pun or two."
15-11-2018T00:25:21,Vatruvius,"But puns do elicit a certain response, some can be really good and other...well..."
15-11-2018T00:26:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Example of a pun that made me kinda :ptv-unimpressed:
15-11-2018T00:26:20,SpazztasticKiwi,You know the movie Moana
15-11-2018T00:26:37,Vatruvius,Yes...
15-11-2018T00:27:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"With Maui, how he has those tattoos of his life on his back?"
15-11-2018T00:27:29,Vatruvius,Yeah...
15-11-2018T00:27:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Someone made the remark ‚Äúit‚Äôs his backstory‚Äù

15-11-2018T00:28:19,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs good. But now that‚Äôs the only thing I can think of
15-11-2018T00:28:25,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-power:
15-11-2018T00:28:41,Vatruvius,Somehow I think that that part of Maui started out as a pun in the office and became a thing in the final version of the film...
15-11-2018T00:29:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"Thing is, i tell the same thing to people. Because it‚Äôs true"
15-11-2018T00:29:23,Vatruvius,Want to hear a REALLY bad pun one of my old friends use to tell ALL the time?
15-11-2018T00:29:51,SpazztasticKiwi,And they have the same reaction I did: it‚Äôs cleaver and funny but I‚Äôm slightly anger
15-11-2018T00:30:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Sure. Go for it
15-11-2018T00:30:41,Vatruvius,Let me start off by saying this is not my pun and I mean no offence to those from Russia.
15-11-2018T00:30:59,Vatruvius,Why did the Russians take so long to win the war?
15-11-2018T00:31:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh no
15-11-2018T00:31:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Why
15-11-2018T00:31:17,Vatruvius,Because they were Stalin.
15-11-2018T00:31:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah I think ive seen that on a ‚Äúcrazy school assignment answers‚Äù thing
15-11-2018T00:32:35,Vatruvius,"Probably. Every time he said this joke he would crack up but everyone else including myself would just stare and be like...""ahh"""

15-11-2018T00:36:51,Ordithus,Wow CrRAR

15-11-2018T00:38:17,SpazztasticKiwi,She and Father Time may have had a fight
15-11-2018T00:38:18,Ordithus,"Oh, it's even wet snow.  Ick"
15-11-2018T00:38:18,CrRAR,"Indeed, kiwi, indeed."

15-11-2018T00:40:45,Ordithus,Very
15-11-2018T00:40:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause they never actually fall but they just wobble and flop around with the shovel in their hand and it‚Äôs just pure gold

15-11-2018T00:42:27,CrRAR,I wish you the best of dreams~
15-11-2018T00:43:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok well it‚Äôs not entirely the full one but so good
15-11-2018T00:43:19,CrRAR,Ahhlol he recovered. What a champ
15-11-2018T00:43:31,SpazztasticKiwi,And I feel bad for laughing but he didn‚Äôt get hurt
15-11-2018T00:44:17,CrRAR,Shovel throw totally unbuggered his buggery.
15-11-2018T00:44:35,CrRAR,That's TECHNIQUE
15-11-2018T00:45:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I just feel slightly like the guy who‚Äôs filming and just absolutely wheezing with laughter
15-11-2018T00:45:47,CrRAR,Indeed
15-11-2018T00:46:13,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs like that shovel was causing a game glitch in his walk cycle
15-11-2018T00:47:20,Vatruvius,That is some VERY unsuccessful snow shoveling right there.
15-11-2018T00:47:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Finally decides ‚Äúnot worth it‚Äù and just chucks the thing
15-11-2018T00:47:54,SpazztasticKiwi,And suddenly all is well
15-11-2018T00:48:44,Vatruvius,"Huh...this is what I should have lead in with. *Tosses shovel at snow* ""I expect you to be all cleaned up when I return, you hear?"""
15-11-2018T00:49:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Seems he‚Äôd be the kind of person to come back outside with a blowtorch
15-11-2018T00:50:11,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúHOW ABOUT THIS METHOD THEN?!‚Äù
15-11-2018T00:50:51,Vatruvius,"Better yet, ""I think now is a GREAT time to test out my flame thrower!"""
15-11-2018T00:51:39,Vatruvius,Problem with that method is when the clouds leave all that melted snow will turn into black ice on the drive way which is no good. Shoveling is best to avoid black ice.
15-11-2018T00:53:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"Thing is, I feel for the guy. But God it‚Äôs funny"
15-11-2018T00:53:48,Vatruvius,"It is funny, but I can tell you from personal experience that his face after that is bright red and very angry."
15-11-2018T00:54:13,Vatruvius,The adrenaline is real.

15-11-2018T00:58:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"And as for that man, again, I‚Äôm happy he wasn‚Äôt hurt. Hopefully he was able to just go back inside and recollect before trying again. Going at it again so soon being angry may have ended him somehow worse"
15-11-2018T00:59:29,Vatruvius,It would have landed him on his ass throwing angry snowballs at snow...
15-11-2018T00:59:44,Vatruvius,Then getting even more angry for frozen fingers...
15-11-2018T01:00:07,SpazztasticKiwi,May have attracted a concerned neighbor ‚ÄúI think you should calm down‚Äù

15-11-2018T01:37:25,Vatruvius,"What on Earth Dadro, how long did that take you to find? Have you been searching this whole time?!"
15-11-2018T01:37:33,Dadrobit,"Alas, I obviously don't have the psd so it's not the greatest source to find, but it's something I suppose."
15-11-2018T01:37:54,Twokinds,Yeah
15-11-2018T01:38:12,Twokinds,Did the file say how old it was
15-11-2018T01:38:22,Twokinds,It might help me to figure out how long ago it was from
15-11-2018T01:39:22,iliar,Wait a minute. I remember on which stream you drew it.
15-11-2018T01:39:37,Vatruvius,Here we go...
15-11-2018T01:39:46,Dadrobit,"I think I downloaded it from someone else well past its original date, sorry. But August 6th is my created date."
15-11-2018T01:39:51,Twokinds,Well that would help

15-11-2018T01:40:31,Dadrobit,"And no, it took maybe 15-20 minutes of sleuthing. Only just got back on and was reading the chat and thought I could maybe help get something."
15-11-2018T01:40:43,Twokinds,I don't know why I didn't finish this one.
15-11-2018T01:40:47,Twokinds,I think I just forgot about it.
15-11-2018T01:41:10,Twokinds,"And then couldn't find it, obviously"
15-11-2018T01:41:45,Vatruvius,Wonder if it was saved somewhere it shouldn't have been?

15-11-2018T01:44:12,Dadrobit,I was still gainfully employed in security back then.

15-11-2018T01:47:05,Vatruvius,"I wouldn't blame you for forgetting Tom, it has been over a year and a half since you drew it."
15-11-2018T01:47:15,Dadrobit,It was a random comment that kind of came out of nowhere burning unsteddy.
15-11-2018T01:47:41,Dadrobit,I fondly recall laughing my ass off when I saw it back then.
15-11-2018T01:47:44,Vatruvius,But he is a mod now so...
15-11-2018T01:47:51,Vatruvius,I see...was it in the stream?
15-11-2018T01:47:58,Dadrobit,What's he gonna do? Ban me?
15-11-2018T01:47:59,Vatruvius,Or video rather.
15-11-2018T01:48:00,iliar,And I think about using Nora Card on this sketch from this stream https://yadi.sk/i/B-GmD2QZ3ZxAu4

15-11-2018T01:48:23,Vatruvius,Here we go...
15-11-2018T01:48:34,Twokinds,All those sketches were in the comic psd for the page I later drew in that stream

15-11-2018T01:48:41,Vatruvius,lol
15-11-2018T01:48:48,Dadrobit,Ohhhhhh~ That makes sense!
15-11-2018T01:48:52,Vatruvius,Exactly not where it was suppose to be...
15-11-2018T01:49:16,Vatruvius,"Darn computer, can't you read my mind!?!"
15-11-2018T01:49:49,Dadrobit,Also had that high quality smiley face tiger sketch at 4:08. Too bad it has a lot of butt in it.
15-11-2018T01:50:00,Vatruvius,"Though I have to say, if this sketch finally gets posted I fear the Therie x Daniels will come back in full force..."
15-11-2018T01:50:26,Vatruvius,"Curse you Patreon, don't you know a good thing when you see it?"
15-11-2018T01:50:33,Vatruvius,XD
15-11-2018T01:52:27,iliar,Quick note. If I ever hacked into Tom's computer and downloaded all the pictures. I need to carefully review the PSD files
15-11-2018T01:53:44,Twokinds,"You know, the comic psds probably contain a lot of draft sketches and different versions of panels that are just lost to time."
15-11-2018T01:54:08,Twokinds,Cause sometimes I'll just doodle while trying to come up with ideas
15-11-2018T01:54:54,iliar,Some your doodle looks good https://yadi.sk/i/frirNTy84ROynA
15-11-2018T01:54:56,Vatruvius,Not a bad idea.

15-11-2018T02:02:05,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs great - means it‚Äôs not lost and it can join the collection üôåüèª
15-11-2018T02:02:09,Vatruvius,I am pretty sure my Chrome browser is broken. D:
15-11-2018T02:02:20,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs not good
15-11-2018T02:02:23,Vatruvius,I cannot watch Amazon or Netflix.
15-11-2018T02:02:32,SpazztasticKiwi,The travesty
15-11-2018T02:02:38,SpazztasticKiwi,How shall you live
15-11-2018T02:02:48,Vatruvius,But I do not want to reinstall because I have some stuff saved on Chrome that I cannot forget right now. Working on college applications.
15-11-2018T02:03:06,Vatruvius,"So perhaps after I submit I will reinstall. Still a pain, I have to use Internet Explorer."

15-11-2018T02:03:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Sacrifices are necessary at times. Hopefully you will adapt
15-11-2018T02:03:48,SpazztasticKiwi,ü§ûüèªFor now
15-11-2018T02:04:05,Vatruvius,"Well, applications are due on the 30 so not too much longer."
15-11-2018T02:04:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Feel like they‚Äôre going well?
15-11-2018T02:06:17,Vatruvius,Since I am applying to transfer it really falls down to my performance on my transcript which could have done better but is way better than typical students. I just hope it is enough.

15-11-2018T02:09:37,Twokinds,Time for sleep. Goodnight!
15-11-2018T02:09:42,Vatruvius,I have done this before two years ago. I am not really stressed as much as I am just hoping this time I actually get into nice schools rather than the back-ups. Early college high school-ers really get the bottom of the barrel as far as the system is
15-11-2018T02:09:43,Vatruvius,concerned.
15-11-2018T02:09:51,iliar,Goodnight!

15-11-2018T02:15:33,Dadrobit,Have a good one all y'all that are heading to bed. And you mothers and brothers and sisters and fathers and assorted family and pets...

15-11-2018T10:20:00,Twokinds,I've been to Atlanta a few times.
15-11-2018T10:43:13,FennexTheFox,How was it those times? :3
15-11-2018T10:49:30,Twokinds,Uh... I don't know
15-11-2018T10:49:38,Twokinds,Most of my time was inside a convention.
15-11-2018T10:49:44,Twokinds,So I never saw much of the city.
15-11-2018T11:17:03,Xexanoth,"meh, citys are all the same anyways....."
15-11-2018T11:19:48,Twokinds,"I'm not sure about that. I went to Pittsburg and it was really nice, I thought."
15-11-2018T11:20:04,Twokinds,Quite different than other cities I've been in. A lot less busy.
15-11-2018T11:29:11,Dadrobit,Phoenix is pretty quiet as well and traffic flows really well. I think it's likely due to the fact that nobody wants to actually be outside for any longer than they have to be.
15-11-2018T11:31:40,CommanderTrace,Have you ever visited germany Tom?
15-11-2018T11:43:04,Twokinds,yes
15-11-2018T11:57:18,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-katdryer:

15-11-2018T12:05:31,Twokinds,I spent two weeks in a town south of Frankfurt and then two weeks in M√ºnchen. I also visited Salzburg.
15-11-2018T12:15:11,TorqueEmUp,I still have never left the U.S. :(
15-11-2018T12:16:31,TorqueEmUp,I haven't even been on the Western Half of the country.
15-11-2018T12:19:11,Twokinds,Nothing stopping you!
15-11-2018T12:22:16,Xexanoth,"I've been to houston and seattle, so my experince with the US is ""Hot"" and ""Rain"" XD"

15-11-2018T12:23:22,Twokinds,Those are the two types of weather one might expect from those places
15-11-2018T12:26:21,TerraTheWizard,i need to visit america at some point
15-11-2018T12:26:31,TerraTheWizard,and maybe canadia too

15-11-2018T12:29:06,Xexanoth,"well, if you want cool sights you pretty much have to visit the entire planet. neat stuff everywhere....then again i love history stuff so that might just be me"

15-11-2018T22:00:53,Bgrmystr2,"might just be you, fomo"
15-11-2018T22:00:58,unsteddyphoenix,youre a maniac
15-11-2018T22:01:02,Combak,... I don't think that's possible.

15-11-2018T22:01:36,Combak,For Let's Go Eevee/Pikachu

15-11-2018T22:03:57,SageSaga,brb
15-11-2018T22:04:33,Tharkis,that cheeky expression )--(
15-11-2018T22:04:38,totallynotTrace,The detective pikachu commercial is the first time ever i have been legitimately interested in anything pokemon and even then its only because it sounds like pg-13 deadpool
15-11-2018T22:04:52,unsteddyphoenix,<:T
15-11-2018T22:05:02,Corinthian,Yeah idk why the dude who played Deadpool is voicing Pikachu
15-11-2018T22:05:17,BadFoMo,...
15-11-2018T22:05:41,Twokinds,Because... we're in the weirdest timeline?
15-11-2018T22:05:46,Bgrmystr2,"lol, you're next level nottrace"
15-11-2018T22:06:05,totallynotTrace,i wanna know pikachus voice in other languages like japanese
15-11-2018T22:06:14,unsteddyphoenix,We wanted more adult pokemon stories
15-11-2018T22:06:18,unsteddyphoenix,And we...got it?
15-11-2018T22:06:20,totallynotTrace,actually im gunna search that now
15-11-2018T22:06:23,unsteddyphoenix,Yay? Maybe?
15-11-2018T22:06:28,Bgrmystr2,"not interested in the base thing, but interested in the thing that ppl consider controversial"
15-11-2018T22:06:55,SageSaga,there was a video of Pikachu saying Pika Pika in a bunch of different languages
15-11-2018T22:07:47,ZRO4825,"Yeah, and the only one that changed was the German. The rest of them all left the original voice actress' ""Pika-pika"" :rofl:"
15-11-2018T22:08:12,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-pouty: SPOILERS
15-11-2018T22:08:29,ZRO4825,"Kaylin 'daki made me careless, Sage's fault."
15-11-2018T22:08:44,totallynotTrace,im not finding it in other languages :(
15-11-2018T22:08:50,SageSaga,you gonna buy one?
15-11-2018T22:09:00,ZRO4825,Sure :3
15-11-2018T22:09:07,Bgrmystr2,it's zro. you think he isn't gonna buy one? :P
15-11-2018T22:09:18,Bgrmystr2,at least.
15-11-2018T22:09:41,Vatruvius,Sage!
15-11-2018T22:09:44,ZRO4825,"Admittedly not big on Nyna, though I do find her adorable. Now if it'd been Toyoko, I'd buy like 3."
15-11-2018T22:09:50,ZRO4825,"Okay, probably not, but I'd WANT to buy like 3."
15-11-2018T22:09:55,Vatruvius,Hey everyone! :ptv-greetings:

15-11-2018T22:10:23,Vatruvius,What exactly am I looking at here Sage?
15-11-2018T22:10:25,SageSaga,im trying to figure out if i should sell em for 50 or 60
15-11-2018T22:10:32,SageSaga,Body pillows!
15-11-2018T22:10:44,SageSaga,im getting them printed soon- but very limited supply
15-11-2018T22:10:50,Vatruvius,I see...
15-11-2018T22:10:52,SageSaga,very limited...
15-11-2018T22:10:53,BadFoMo,Cents or Dollars?
15-11-2018T22:11:00,Bgrmystr2,Fomo if you have to ask..
15-11-2018T22:11:01,Vatruvius,"Cents, obviously."
15-11-2018T22:11:01,unsteddyphoenix,$10 discount if youre a patreon?
15-11-2018T22:11:02,SageSaga,im buying 9 of each- well 10- but im keeping them
15-11-2018T22:11:10,FoxxTrotter,"I'm sure it's not cents, FoMo. ;0P"
15-11-2018T22:11:17,BadFoMo,Yen?
15-11-2018T22:11:21,Vatruvius,"Sage likes to embrace the starving, homeless, artist lifestyle. XD"
15-11-2018T22:11:27,BadFoMo,Euros?
15-11-2018T22:11:32,SageSaga,maybe 60USD and Free Shipping if you are a patron
15-11-2018T22:11:40,FoxxTrotter,Pounds (well higher than the dollar).
15-11-2018T22:11:42,unsteddyphoenix,That works
15-11-2018T22:11:47,totallynotTrace,"oh they only had Det pika trailer in english, Spanish, French, Italian, and German"
15-11-2018T22:13:10,BadFoMo,"Well, I think I'm done Trolling for now. I think I'll take a nap."
15-11-2018T22:13:22,Vatruvius,Night FoMo!
15-11-2018T22:13:49,Bgrmystr2,"You were done before you started, sir."
15-11-2018T22:14:26,Vatruvius,I am really surprised that I am watching both streams right now without any buffering...
15-11-2018T22:14:33,SageSaga,i need to sell 7 or more to break even
15-11-2018T22:14:44,Vatruvius,I am sure they will sell.
15-11-2018T22:15:00,Bgrmystr2,"Welcome, Vatru. This is what it's like to have a normal connection."
15-11-2018T22:15:19,Vatruvius,"I mean, the likely hood that there is not at least 7 individuals that would buy those is...slim I would think."
15-11-2018T22:15:30,Vatruvius,This is so nice Bgr!
15-11-2018T22:15:39,Bgrmystr2,right?
15-11-2018T22:15:43,totallynotTrace,wow the german version of the Pikachu trailer is just weird without Renolds voice
15-11-2018T22:15:46,Bgrmystr2,and yeah I think they'll sell sage
15-11-2018T22:15:51,BadFoMo,@Bgrmystr2 You broke it for me!
15-11-2018T22:15:58,Bgrmystr2,I didn't break anything Fomo
15-11-2018T22:16:08,Bgrmystr2,you did that all on your own.
15-11-2018T22:16:16,Twokinds,Why didn't they just use German Ryan Renolds
15-11-2018T22:16:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,he was busy being eevee
15-11-2018T22:16:29,Vatruvius,German Ryan Renolds?!
15-11-2018T22:16:31,Bgrmystr2,or make Ryan Renolds speak German
15-11-2018T22:16:37,Bgrmystr2,good alternative
15-11-2018T22:16:41,SageSaga,and if i sell them all- i'll have enough money to buy- uhhh food for 2 months
15-11-2018T22:16:46,totallynotTrace,Thanks! now i want Ryan to learn german
15-11-2018T22:16:52,BadFoMo,"Just as you mensioned the connection, I lost mine for a few seconds."
15-11-2018T22:16:53,Vatruvius,That is a plus Sage.
15-11-2018T22:16:57,Vatruvius,Food is always good.
15-11-2018T22:17:07,totallynotTrace,and spanish. and japanese
15-11-2018T22:17:11,Bgrmystr2,and all was at peace Fomo.. for those few secons.
15-11-2018T22:17:14,Bgrmystr2,"seconds, even."
15-11-2018T22:17:15,Vatruvius,Technically I mentioned it FoMo.
15-11-2018T22:17:25,Vatruvius,Ouch...
15-11-2018T22:17:27,Bgrmystr2,and yeah nice job blaming me :P
15-11-2018T22:17:35,BadFoMo,"Anyway, nap time."
15-11-2018T22:17:49,Vatruvius,"I mean, you are just so blamable Bgr."
15-11-2018T22:17:51,Vatruvius,Xd

15-11-2018T22:17:58,Bgrmystr2,:P
15-11-2018T22:18:07,Bgrmystr2,especially when it's not something I had anything to do with.
15-11-2018T22:18:19,Vatruvius,That could be seen as a compliment.
15-11-2018T22:18:21,totallynotTrace,Especially that XD
15-11-2018T22:18:34,Vatruvius,You are the one that everyone can open up to.
15-11-2018T22:18:49,SageSaga,oh- did i mention i heard back from Patreon again?
15-11-2018T22:18:59,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-RainbowThrowup: I did not want these open cans of  worms
15-11-2018T22:19:02,Vatruvius,What is Patreon only this time around?
15-11-2018T22:19:07,Vatruvius,lol
15-11-2018T22:19:19,Ordithus,Any good news?
15-11-2018T22:19:32,ZRO4825,Oh? How much of it's my fault this time? :rofl:
15-11-2018T22:19:42,Bgrmystr2,"Sage, I'd prolly buy em if I had the money to. But shit, I wouldn't mind paying upfront so you can get em made lol"
15-11-2018T22:19:46,SageSaga,well apparently they lied to me about setting things as patreon only
15-11-2018T22:19:51,Vatruvius,Everything on Patreon is your fault ZRO.
15-11-2018T22:19:54,ZRO4825,Nani?
15-11-2018T22:19:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,wah?
15-11-2018T22:20:00,unsteddyphoenix,:thinking:
15-11-2018T22:20:07,Bgrmystr2,Patreon lies confirmed
15-11-2018T22:20:07,ZRO4825,"Well, in this instance, Vatru, that's not far from the truth apparently. XD"
15-11-2018T22:20:15,Vatruvius,lol
15-11-2018T22:20:39,SageSaga,they told me to keep my page not 18+ i could just hide material behind the patreon only thing that way the patreon page was safe for all
15-11-2018T22:21:00,Vatruvius,Now they want your patreon to be 18+ yes?
15-11-2018T22:21:04,SageSaga,but nope- i need to delete any posts that may IMPLY ANY NUDITY
15-11-2018T22:21:22,SageSaga,they already auto set me to be 18+
15-11-2018T22:21:23,Vatruvius,Delete!? Not put behind Patreon only?
15-11-2018T22:21:33,unsteddyphoenix,That cant be right
15-11-2018T22:21:43,Ordithus,Yeesh
15-11-2018T22:21:44,Combak,"Uh oh, Tom?"
15-11-2018T22:21:53,Combak,You might be in trouble soon. XD
15-11-2018T22:21:56,SageSaga,I just explained even if its behind Patreon only they would consider me an 18+ patreon
15-11-2018T22:22:04,Ordithus,Tom's patreon is already 18+
15-11-2018T22:22:10,Twokinds,My patreon is already 18+... yeah
15-11-2018T22:22:18,Combak,Oh.

15-11-2018T22:22:35,unsteddyphoenix,"Welp, guess thats that then"
15-11-2018T22:22:44,SageSaga,"anyways- the thing is i kept saying to them ""You do realize you can have mature work that isnt Adults only, right?"""
15-11-2018T22:22:54,ZRO4825,"Yeah, if you wanna be picky, Tom's shows even less nudity. Cuz everyone has fur...well, most of the time. 'cept Maren. She just doesn't care, lol."
15-11-2018T22:22:59,Combak,"Evidently, Patreon is run by Never Nudes."
15-11-2018T22:23:00,Vatruvius,"I am already going to have to design my own website for my webcomic when it comes out, might as well add posting and donations to it."
15-11-2018T22:23:16,Ordithus,"ZRO, <3 Maren"
15-11-2018T22:23:19,SageSaga,i get my work isnt appropriate for SMALL CHILDREN (Although my Nephew seems to like it)

15-11-2018T22:23:33,totallynotTrace,oh no! all of those underage kids are totally going to ask there parents permision to follow Sage/Toms 18+ pages *sarcastic scoff*
15-11-2018T22:23:34,Bgrmystr2,lol sage I wonder why :P
15-11-2018T22:23:37,Ordithus,Your nephew will surely be scarred for life

15-11-2018T23:34:55,SageSaga,he told me it was supposed to be 300DPI so i went 350 so i could drop it by 50 and have it at 300 nice and clean-
15-11-2018T23:35:03,SageSaga,turns out it should have been 150

15-11-2018T23:36:31,Ordithus,One wash and it's all ruined
15-11-2018T23:36:33,SageSaga,fabric is lower res because printing on fabric has more bleed in
