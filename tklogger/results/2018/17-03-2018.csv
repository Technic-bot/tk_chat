17-03-2018T00:27:57,TheBeckoner,Night
17-03-2018T03:57:15,Barabashe4ka,Hello everybody
17-03-2018T10:51:33,Vatruvius,:ptv-laugh: Hey everyone...:ptv-sleepy:
17-03-2018T11:12:35,Vatruvius,Amuone want to switch beds with my terrible...I mean awsome...spring bed that makes you get a good *cough* nights sleep?
17-03-2018T11:12:48,Vatruvius,anyone*
17-03-2018T11:44:06,UnknownEnd,Hmm
17-03-2018T12:04:55,Vatruvius,Undecided @UnknownEnd
17-03-2018T12:10:53,Combak,Hey all.
17-03-2018T12:11:58,Vatruvius,Hey!
17-03-2018T13:10:53,Bgrmystr2,lol Vatru I have a pillowtop
17-03-2018T13:10:58,Bgrmystr2,polite pass
17-03-2018T13:11:15,Bgrmystr2,though below the mattress is still a springboard
17-03-2018T13:11:26,Bgrmystr2,so technically.. close enough
17-03-2018T13:14:38,Vatruvius,Lol...I am okay. Just these baeds at the place I am staying at are horible.
17-03-2018T13:14:49,Vatruvius,beds*
17-03-2018T13:15:34,Bgrmystr2,they're probably generic bets
17-03-2018T13:15:39,Bgrmystr2,..beds* even
17-03-2018T13:23:00,Vatruvius,"Yeah, they are. A spring bed on a bed spring mesh...just a lot of springs going on resulting in back aches and terrible sleep."
17-03-2018T13:23:47,Combak,"Hey, new sketch is up, if you haven't seen it."

17-03-2018T13:26:48,Vatruvius,Hey Tom!
17-03-2018T13:28:42,Vatruvius,Agh...this one so sad...:ptv-whiny:

17-03-2018T13:29:48,Bgrmystr2,was my favorite version.
17-03-2018T13:29:52,Twokinds,Hello
17-03-2018T13:29:57,Bgrmystr2,Hello tom.
17-03-2018T13:30:00,Twokinds,Not bad just editing suggestions that are too darn long
17-03-2018T13:30:59,Twokinds,Hm
17-03-2018T13:31:05,Twokinds,"And one suggestions is just ""Hot Tub"""
17-03-2018T13:31:16,Vatruvius,I tried to keep mine short but I think it is still long. How many characters should be the max?
17-03-2018T13:31:19,Vatruvius,Lol
17-03-2018T13:31:22,Vatruvius,Done
17-03-2018T13:31:25,Bgrmystr2,that one should be easy tom
17-03-2018T13:31:29,Bgrmystr2,just draw the hot tub
17-03-2018T13:31:32,Bgrmystr2,noone in it
17-03-2018T13:31:36,Bgrmystr2,just the hot tub itself
17-03-2018T13:31:41,Vatruvius,Lol
17-03-2018T13:31:47,Bgrmystr2,If that's the suggestion
17-03-2018T13:46:41,Twokinds,People really need to learn to use capitalization more.
17-03-2018T13:48:21,Combak,For sure.
17-03-2018T13:50:15,PhilTheIdle,Oh yes.
17-03-2018T13:51:15,Twokinds,I assume it's because they're making the suggestion on a phone
17-03-2018T13:52:07,Twokinds,We have some good suggestions this week
17-03-2018T13:52:50,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
17-03-2018T13:56:47,Combak,Yay?
17-03-2018T13:56:53,goldgardian,More of Daniels and Therie?
17-03-2018T13:57:04,goldgardian,There's been a lot of that recently
17-03-2018T13:57:04,Combak,Let's hope they don't get smushed together.
17-03-2018T13:57:26,Combak,"In the polls, I mean."
17-03-2018T13:57:51,goldgardian,"what, you mean, like several suggestions combined?"
17-03-2018T13:58:22,Twokinds,No more Daniels and Therie! X_x It's too much. I'm gunna have to call a kibosh on that soon.
17-03-2018T13:58:32,Combak,"No, as in multiple really good suggestions being in a single poll. There's only one winner, after all, and only one Tom pick."
17-03-2018T13:58:32,Ordithus,"What makes a suggestion good, in Tom's view? :ptv-wondering:"
17-03-2018T13:58:45,Twokinds,"I'm glad people like it, but there's just a little too much bandwagoning going on."
17-03-2018T13:59:34,Ordithus,Does Tom like jokes?  Does he like cheesecake?  Does he like green eggs and ham?
17-03-2018T13:59:50,Xexanoth,"well, back to pet daughter"
17-03-2018T14:00:11,Twokinds,I just like good ideas.
17-03-2018T14:00:31,Combak,"You realize ""good"" is subjective, right Tom?"
17-03-2018T14:00:57,goldgardian,Ideas that appeal to him?
17-03-2018T14:00:58,Twokinds,No it's not. My opinions are objective facts.
17-03-2018T14:01:12,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-kingtea:
17-03-2018T14:01:25,Combak,"I think he's asking what makes the good ideas, in your not-so-humble opinion."
17-03-2018T14:01:42,Ordithus,Not seriously asking.  I was expecting Tom trolls :P
17-03-2018T14:02:11,Xexanoth,Everything that has only 1 Character in it is a good suggestion XD
17-03-2018T14:03:15,goldgardian,"I love how now that it's a little too late, I get a million and a half good ideas..."
17-03-2018T14:03:33,Combak,Write them down somewhere for next week!
17-03-2018T14:03:52,Combak,Or type. I have a Word Doc for my suggestions once I get on Patreon.
17-03-2018T14:05:36,goldgardian,"Keith as shovel knight, Lizardfolk Cleric and his party, Trace Legacy cosplaying Jace Belren, and Flora teasing him dressed up like Lilliana Vess..."
17-03-2018T14:05:51,goldgardian,I am a font of ideas right now
17-03-2018T14:06:18,Combak,MtG cards?
17-03-2018T14:06:29,Combak,Shovel Knight I get.
17-03-2018T14:06:57,goldgardian,"yeah, MTG Planeswalkers"
17-03-2018T14:07:03,Combak,Cool.
17-03-2018T14:12:50,goldgardian,"Trace making the grave mistake of Teaching flora magic, Nora and Paarthurnax interacting while Trace meets the Dragonborn, Red swallowing his pride and asking for sword lessons from keith.."
17-03-2018T14:13:04,goldgardian,", Maddie tricking Natani into wearing a dress... somehow... and his enraged/confused reaction"
17-03-2018T14:13:46,goldgardian,"I have become Shiva, destroyer of artist's wrists"
17-03-2018T14:14:20,Vatruvius,OMG...stop gold...some of these are too good.
17-03-2018T14:14:37,goldgardian,"okay, okay.. I'll stop...\"
17-03-2018T14:15:07,Vatruvius,It is a shame though that I will not be able to catch the stream. :ptv-sad:
17-03-2018T14:15:29,Vatruvius,Hopefully I can still find a way to vote for sketches.
17-03-2018T14:15:36,Combak,"I know someone suggested a meeting between Paarthunax and Nora before. ""I'll show you how to REALLY shout."""
17-03-2018T14:16:07,Combak,Red swallowing his pride and Maddie tricking Natani are also really good ideas.
17-03-2018T14:16:22,goldgardian,I'm writing these down for later
17-03-2018T14:18:03,goldgardian,"unfortunately i'm going to miss a good chunck of the stream, seeing as my mum's taking me out for a birthday dinner"
17-03-2018T14:18:17,Combak,"Well hey, have a good meal!"
17-03-2018T14:18:23,goldgardian,I shall!
17-03-2018T14:24:29,Twokinds,I'm going to miss a good chunk of the stream as well.
17-03-2018T14:24:36,Twokinds,That's life though.
17-03-2018T14:24:41,Vatruvius,Lol
17-03-2018T14:24:44,goldgardian,XD
17-03-2018T14:25:41,Combak,Ha.

17-03-2018T14:49:12,Bgrmystr2,"empty, Prose? No."
17-03-2018T14:49:15,Bgrmystr2,not usually
17-03-2018T14:49:21,Vatruvius,"No @ProsePro7, never."
17-03-2018T14:49:26,Bgrmystr2,"void of people speaking, yes sometimes."
17-03-2018T14:49:42,ProsePro7,I thought I would be first.  Shows what I know
17-03-2018T14:50:20,Bgrmystr2,I probably haven't properly left in months lol
17-03-2018T14:50:23,Kamaro12,hello
17-03-2018T14:50:29,Kamaro12,so that patreon post today kinda made me wonder
17-03-2018T14:50:29,NeonMitsumi,Hey Kam
17-03-2018T14:50:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Kam
17-03-2018T14:50:30,Bgrmystr2,I keep my browser open with this in a tab
17-03-2018T14:50:39,Kamaro12,would Alaric have really killed Keith if he had the opportunity?
17-03-2018T14:50:43,ProsePro7,Greetings Kama
17-03-2018T14:50:57,Bgrmystr2,hey Kam
17-03-2018T14:51:02,Kamaro12,hallo
17-03-2018T14:51:10,Vatruvius,Doubt it @Kamaro12
17-03-2018T14:51:13,ProsePro7,Depends if the theory about him is true
17-03-2018T14:51:19,Kamaro12,what theory
17-03-2018T14:51:44,Vatruvius,"Keith would have lost had Alaric wanted him to, but he didn't."
17-03-2018T14:51:45,ProsePro7,That he had a thing for Keith
17-03-2018T14:51:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,if Alaric cuts down what he loves he can gain unlimited power
17-03-2018T14:52:16,ProsePro7,DIE!
17-03-2018T14:52:38,Ordithus,"""Cut Keith down, and your journey to the dark side will be complete"""
17-03-2018T14:52:46,Kamaro12,but then that kind of undermines all the stringpulling that he did to make it so Keith would be accepted back into society
17-03-2018T14:53:03,ProsePro7,Yeah Keiths life isnt tragic enough lets kill him while we are at it
17-03-2018T14:53:19,Vatruvius,That is exactly why Alaric wanted to lose.
17-03-2018T14:53:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,then Natani becomes the punisher
17-03-2018T14:53:24,Kamaro12,"Vat: eh, dunno about that. He didn't really see that bridge collapsing thing coming"
17-03-2018T14:53:34,Kamaro12,I think Keith outsmarted him in that moment
17-03-2018T14:53:42,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, I was fairly sure Alaric knew he would lose to Keith."
17-03-2018T14:53:43,ProsePro7,Remeber he had lots of plans
17-03-2018T14:54:12,Kamaro12,I don't think he planned on dying though &gt;.&gt;
17-03-2018T14:54:16,Bgrmystr2,well no
17-03-2018T14:54:18,Bgrmystr2,obviously not
17-03-2018T14:54:24,Kamaro12,but yeah
17-03-2018T14:54:39,Kamaro12,although basitins are biologically compulsed to follow orders right?
17-03-2018T14:54:40,ProsePro7,Well not as his first plan but it was one of them
17-03-2018T14:54:47,Vatruvius,"I do not think Alaric saw how he would die but figured, with all that was going on, he would die so Keith can become a general. He may not have known how, but knew he would."
17-03-2018T14:55:02,Bgrmystr2,"Vatru, wat xD"
17-03-2018T14:55:20,Vatruvius,Hmm?
17-03-2018T14:55:42,SpazztasticKiwi,“Guess I’ll die”
17-03-2018T14:55:56,Bgrmystr2,"not seeing the connection, honestly"

17-03-2018T16:39:25,ThingsAreMoving,Natani: Huh... tastes like cherries.

17-03-2018T16:39:43,LolitaWolf,Lol
17-03-2018T16:39:45,Darkewulf,"What if the rag over Natani's eyes was one of his bandages, and what Keith thought was a towel (because prude) was actually the other set of bandages?"

17-03-2018T16:44:01,Darkewulf,And the world's best cuddle buddy

17-03-2018T16:54:25,TorqueEmUp,I imagine it'd be funnier with Zen evesdropping on Nat and Keith doing it.
17-03-2018T16:54:28,Darkewulf,"This ship makes perfect sense to me. Kat obviously has a crush on Natani despite knowing he's physically female. Due to the nature of their mind link, Natani and Zen have very similar personalities. Unlike Natani, however, Zen is (for all we know) single."

17-03-2018T20:28:31,unsteddyphoenix,I wonder how that would go
17-03-2018T20:28:37,InTheLionsDen,Therie and Daniel suggestions may be made but they will only be drawn as stick figures.
17-03-2018T20:28:42,unsteddyphoenix,I know the one you mean w0lf
17-03-2018T20:29:06,Bigboi182,Very well Unsteddy (I hope)
17-03-2018T20:29:10,BadFoMo,@Combak That might be ease due to next week being (I think?) a Color Stream.
17-03-2018T20:29:30,ThingsAreMoving,"next week is sketch stream, no?"
17-03-2018T20:29:39,Combak,"No, the week after that at earliest FoMo."
17-03-2018T20:30:06,Bigboi182,"I would either make it a kind of mute one (like Glitchtale) or give all of them voices, making it take even longer."

17-03-2018T20:30:55,Bigboi182,The Sunday afterward will be the colour stream
17-03-2018T20:30:57,ThingsAreMoving,and two weeks from now is easter
17-03-2018T20:31:03,Bigboi182,True.
17-03-2018T20:31:12,ThingsAreMoving,easter themed suggestions needed
17-03-2018T20:31:13,Combak,"Okay, so maybe I'm wrong."
17-03-2018T20:31:14,ChatterboxFTW,Reee?
17-03-2018T20:31:32,Bigboi182,It's up to Tom if he wants to draw on Easter Sunday...

17-03-2018T20:32:28,Bigboi182,"Who is his boss, anyway?"
17-03-2018T20:32:32,ThingsAreMoving,I heard his boss is a pretty cool guy and doesn't afraid of anything
17-03-2018T20:32:42,w0lfmare,Tom is his boss

17-03-2018T21:18:55,Dadrobit,Alaric and Madelyn sparring/fencing. Alaric is getting frustrated as Maddie is impossible to land a hit on. An unstoppable force vs an untouchable object
17-03-2018T21:18:57,CrRAR,(prolly also Clovis' greatest weakness)
17-03-2018T21:19:10,Combak,Ah!
17-03-2018T21:19:21,Combak,I've had that kinda high up before.
17-03-2018T21:20:00,Dadrobit,That's because it's a #QualitySuggestion. High up is where it belongs.
17-03-2018T21:20:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
17-03-2018T21:21:05,Combak,"Well, I need to work on a little bit of homework."
17-03-2018T21:21:08,Combak,Night all!
17-03-2018T21:21:14,Combak,"Tom, thanks for streaming!"
17-03-2018T21:21:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Combak
17-03-2018T21:21:32,unsteddyphoenix,seeya
17-03-2018T21:21:48,Dadrobit,Cya combak
17-03-2018T21:22:02,CrRAR,bye combak
17-03-2018T21:22:11,CrRAR,It's been.. an honor
17-03-2018T21:22:21,CrRAR,o7
17-03-2018T21:22:30,unsteddyphoenix,o7
17-03-2018T21:22:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,o7
17-03-2018T21:22:43,Combak,.o7
17-03-2018T21:22:44,Bigboi182,The suggestion (Laura and Macy) would just be Macy mocking Laura for being so weak
17-03-2018T21:22:59,Bigboi182,o7
17-03-2018T21:23:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,or Laura being a total Dom
17-03-2018T21:23:33,Dadrobit,"Good luck, crossovers tend to get even worse results than mine"
17-03-2018T21:23:33,Bigboi182,"No, the former is better"
17-03-2018T21:24:34,Bigboi182,"If you don't know who AnimatedJames is, you have no idea of what I'm on about."
17-03-2018T21:24:53,Dadrobit,Noooope
17-03-2018T21:24:55,unsteddyphoenix,thats true
17-03-2018T21:24:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,never heard of it
17-03-2018T21:29:07,Bigboi182,"Well, AnimatedJames is an animator who's been around for about 8 or so years. You can check out his youtube channel. Basically, he's making a comic called Off Saving the World. Each character has a purpose for saving the world."
17-03-2018T21:30:41,Bigboi182,"One does it because they were trained to, the other because it's the right thing to do, and the other does it because she had nothing better to do."
17-03-2018T21:31:54,unsteddyphoenix,"Sounds...kinda boring, honestly."
17-03-2018T21:31:58,Bigboi182,"I legit only remember one character, Macy, who just so happens to be a fox like Laura."
17-03-2018T21:32:57,Ordithus,Laura would save the world for Keith :ctwokinds-LauraCry:
17-03-2018T21:33:16,unsteddyphoenix,Unless it means marrying him. Then...
17-03-2018T21:33:26,Ordithus,"Actually, she kinda did.  Only the world was the East Basitin Kingdom"
17-03-2018T21:33:27,Bigboi182,She's the one who has nothing better to do than to save the world
17-03-2018T21:34:05,Bigboi182,She's basically the total opposite of Laura
17-03-2018T21:34:28,Bigboi182,Which all leads up to my suggestion
17-03-2018T21:35:02,Ordithus,"Anyways, I'm glad I made a Sunday stream again.  It had been a while."
17-03-2018T21:35:09,Twokinds,I'm glad I made it too
17-03-2018T21:35:18,Bigboi182,Yeah
17-03-2018T21:35:33,unsteddyphoenix,Same~
17-03-2018T21:35:38,BadFoMo,Da.
17-03-2018T21:35:39,Ordithus,"I know, Tom.  It just wouldn't be the same, without you."
17-03-2018T21:35:53,unsteddyphoenix,Missed the prev stream to play with animals.
17-03-2018T21:35:54,Bigboi182,"Is it me, or did i put WAY too much into the explanation"
17-03-2018T21:36:09,Ordithus,"Yeah, you've got no chance, sorry."
17-03-2018T21:36:46,Ordithus,I appreciate the explanation.  But I don't think people are going to know the crossover.
17-03-2018T21:37:07,Dadrobit,Same
17-03-2018T21:37:11,Ordithus,"Though as Dadrobit can attest, purgatory eventually works!"
17-03-2018T21:37:28,unsteddyphoenix,If you put in the...months.
17-03-2018T21:37:55,Twokinds,Next week is color week
17-03-2018T21:38:03,Bigboi182,"I know a lot of people overlook you because of your younger bro, but you're a great person in your own right. Keep it up Tom, we're rootin for ya!"
17-03-2018T21:38:04,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh, is it?"
17-03-2018T21:38:04,Bgrmystr2,"cuz last sunday of  the month, right?"
17-03-2018T21:38:07,Dadrobit,Aout 7 months is the breaking point
17-03-2018T21:38:14,Bigboi182,Maybe
17-03-2018T21:38:16,Dadrobit,About*
17-03-2018T21:38:25,Terramaster20209,oh dang it
17-03-2018T21:38:39,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah I like 3 sketchs one colour, simpler system."
17-03-2018T21:38:39,Terramaster20209,i missed the end of the stream
17-03-2018T21:38:43,Bigboi182,I'll find something simpler.
17-03-2018T21:38:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I do believe I’ve found my favorite creator
17-03-2018T21:38:53,Bigboi182,Yeah you did
17-03-2018T21:39:20,Twokinds,"3 week, 3 votes, 3 colors"
17-03-2018T21:39:26,Terramaster20209,so what were the last 2 sketches ?
17-03-2018T21:39:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"Granted I’m more of a crafty person than a drawing person, but still"
17-03-2018T21:39:35,Dadrobit,"Ah, no more 4-5?"
17-03-2018T21:39:55,Ordithus,"@Terramaster20209 Dust from Dust: An Elysian Tale, turned into a nimbat"
17-03-2018T21:40:05,Terramaster20209,ok
17-03-2018T21:40:11,Terramaster20209,thanks
17-03-2018T21:40:12,Bigboi182,A dust Fanfic and a Therie/Daniels species swap
17-03-2018T21:40:12,Ordithus,and Therie and Daniels swap species
17-03-2018T21:40:26,unsteddyphoenix,"3 colours now? That sucks but, understandable."
17-03-2018T21:40:27,Ordithus,"Therie is a cute, though soul-less-eyed human"
17-03-2018T21:40:34,Terramaster20209,ill see that tommorow on youtube
17-03-2018T21:40:50,Bigboi182,"Also Terra, i posted something on my dA for ya"

17-03-2018T21:41:19,Twokinds,I've just almost always done 5
17-03-2018T21:41:33,Bigboi182,Oh
17-03-2018T21:41:53,Ordithus,"The one month you didn't, mine was 4th (or 5th) :ptv-pouty:"
17-03-2018T21:41:54,unsteddyphoenix,I mean...
17-03-2018T21:42:08,Twokinds,Which one was it
17-03-2018T21:42:12,Ordithus,The Breakout
17-03-2018T21:42:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Why make rules? So you can break them
17-03-2018T21:42:17,Ordithus,"I'm not mad, at all."
17-03-2018T21:42:19,unsteddyphoenix,Link?
17-03-2018T21:42:20,Ordithus,I just kid
17-03-2018T21:42:24,Twokinds,The breakout?
17-03-2018T21:42:27,Twokinds,Hm

17-03-2018T21:42:45,Bigboi182,I really need to scrape for 10 bucks ro make my siggestions happen
17-03-2018T21:42:46,Bgrmystr2,:(
17-03-2018T21:42:49,unsteddyphoenix,Ohhh
17-03-2018T21:42:50,Ordithus,"Thatks bg, anyway"
17-03-2018T21:42:59,Bgrmystr2,:thumbsup:
17-03-2018T21:43:10,Bigboi182,"The simple ones, of course."
17-03-2018T21:43:55,unsteddyphoenix,"So, are you planning on always doing 3 from now on? Or we could still have the bonus 4th-5th"
17-03-2018T21:44:17,Twokinds,"Always ""at least 3"""
17-03-2018T21:44:26,unsteddyphoenix,Gotcha
17-03-2018T21:44:31,Bgrmystr2,so.. bonus possible
17-03-2018T21:44:39,Ordithus,But not guaranteed~
17-03-2018T21:44:46,Bgrmystr2,so.. nothing changed. :D
17-03-2018T21:44:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Ever done a strictly primary colors/strictly secondary colors drawing?
17-03-2018T21:44:51,Bgrmystr2,good to know
17-03-2018T21:45:44,Twokinds,Yeah I didn't change anything
17-03-2018T21:45:52,unsteddyphoenix,change is scary
17-03-2018T21:46:02,Twokinds,And I don't know
17-03-2018T21:46:36,unsteddyphoenix,Statistically...mustve done one by accident.
17-03-2018T21:46:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Be something to do maybe one time
17-03-2018T21:47:01,Ordithus,"Do a hue shift on the sketches, that'll be primary color only :ptv-snicker:"
17-03-2018T21:47:07,unsteddyphoenix,^
17-03-2018T21:47:12,unsteddyphoenix,Easy photoshop edit
17-03-2018T21:47:49,Bgrmystr2,that would change the outline mostly
17-03-2018T21:47:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Hue variations of primary colors are considered different colors
17-03-2018T21:47:55,Bgrmystr2,wouldn't really fill them with color
17-03-2018T21:48:02,Bigboi182,Yeak
17-03-2018T21:48:14,Bigboi182,*Yeah
17-03-2018T21:48:20,Ordithus,Hue shift from non-primary to a primary
17-03-2018T21:48:31,Ordithus,"The sketches are usually a single hue, I think"
17-03-2018T21:48:39,Bgrmystr2,because a lot of the images drawn have the core shapes for both the characters and the backgrounds
17-03-2018T21:48:54,Bgrmystr2,so a hue change would really just change everything
17-03-2018T21:49:08,qwe304,"ive changed a few of the sktches to black, imo they look beter"
17-03-2018T21:49:24,Ordithus,I liked it that time Tom sketched in purple
17-03-2018T21:49:30,Bgrmystr2,"because black gives a sharper contrast to white, qer"
17-03-2018T21:49:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I like color. It’s why I dyed my hair bright red after I graduated
17-03-2018T21:49:34,Bgrmystr2,qwe*
17-03-2018T21:49:39,Bigboi182,"Tom, I was wondering if you've ever tried out animations?"
17-03-2018T21:49:43,Bgrmystr2,"it's not like it's exactly better, it just stands out more"
17-03-2018T21:49:47,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-nibjump:
17-03-2018T21:50:03,Bigboi182,"Like, full ones"
17-03-2018T21:50:10,Twokinds,Yeah
17-03-2018T21:50:20,Twokinds,I did go to college for animation
17-03-2018T21:50:37,Bigboi182,Aaand...
17-03-2018T21:50:41,SpazztasticKiwi,How much fun did you have
17-03-2018T21:50:42,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
17-03-2018T21:50:51,qwe304,there are some old animations on deviantart
17-03-2018T21:51:05,SpazztasticKiwi,And how many times did you want to throw the computer
17-03-2018T21:51:10,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-florajiggle:
17-03-2018T21:51:13,Twokinds,It was alright
17-03-2018T21:51:20,Bigboi182,"Well yeah, they're's that"
17-03-2018T21:51:35,unsteddyphoenix,"On the off-chance that metal nibs gets coloured, can you make a headbang gif?"
17-03-2018T21:51:52,Twokinds,College was a very easy process.
17-03-2018T21:52:00,Twokinds,And maybe
17-03-2018T21:52:05,SpazztasticKiwi,You’ve got to be one of the most chill people I’ve come across
17-03-2018T21:52:07,qwe304,I got a drawing tablet and did this https://imgur.com/a/zWZQn
17-03-2018T21:52:08,Dadrobit,Back
17-03-2018T21:52:08,Ordithus,:ptv-uneasy: We had a different experience
17-03-2018T21:52:10,unsteddyphoenix,Yessss....
17-03-2018T21:52:19,Dadrobit,Made a chicken quesadilla
17-03-2018T21:52:25,qwe304,its a WIP
17-03-2018T21:52:42,Ordithus,"Tank, boom"
17-03-2018T21:52:53,Bigboi182,Cause I was wondering if you've ever thought about animating the chapters
17-03-2018T21:52:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Tanks looking good Qwe
17-03-2018T21:53:00,Twokinds,"College for me was very casual. I too two classes every week, usually on the same day. So I only went to college once a week."
17-03-2018T21:53:45,Ordithus,Did you complete a bachelor's?
17-03-2018T21:53:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"For my basics, I went twice a week every week"
17-03-2018T21:53:57,Bigboi182,That is avey good college
17-03-2018T21:54:04,Bigboi182,A very
17-03-2018T21:54:08,Twokinds,"Yeah, it took me four years, to be fair."
17-03-2018T21:54:12,Twokinds,lol
17-03-2018T21:54:17,Ordithus,you bastard
17-03-2018T21:54:20,Ordithus,lol
17-03-2018T21:54:27,Dadrobit,Same until the last semester where I've gone into full time classes.
17-03-2018T21:54:28,Bigboi182,Ok then...
17-03-2018T21:54:41,Dadrobit,Was always 2 days a week prior
17-03-2018T21:54:44,Twokinds,"But like, it didn't really matter. I prefer less workload and longer time in college, than the opposite of that."
17-03-2018T21:54:56,Ordithus,"Four years of active classes, usually 5 days a week, several hours a day."
17-03-2018T21:55:00,Bigboi182,So about animating the chapters...
17-03-2018T21:55:02,Twokinds,And it didn't cost any more.
17-03-2018T21:55:17,Dadrobit,"Yup, not gonna put myself into debt for a piece of paper a year early"
17-03-2018T21:55:21,unsteddyphoenix,Same. I just broke under the pressure of a full workload and stopped going to class. :/
17-03-2018T21:55:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I liked my classes. It was the one guy I had problems with
17-03-2018T21:55:37,qwe304,im looking at an engineering degree
17-03-2018T21:55:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Good luck
17-03-2018T21:55:54,Dadrobit,"That was me my first attempt at college, unsteddy."
17-03-2018T21:55:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Gonna need it
17-03-2018T21:56:03,Ordithus,"Lots of work, but ti's worth it, qwe!"
17-03-2018T21:56:14,Dadrobit,"To be fair, I also spent way too much time partying"
17-03-2018T21:56:21,Dadrobit,and video games
17-03-2018T21:56:26,Bigboi182,"Sounds like you have experience, Spazz..."
17-03-2018T21:57:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Experience with Captain Negative? Yes
17-03-2018T21:57:01,unsteddyphoenix,"I avoided parties telling myself I was gonna work, then didnt work. :D"
17-03-2018T21:57:03,Dadrobit,"Thought it was gonna be just like high school, barely pay attention and nab easy A's and B's."
17-03-2018T21:57:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Unfortunately
17-03-2018T21:57:15,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh you were one of THOSE people
17-03-2018T21:57:15,SpazztasticKiwi,No parties though
17-03-2018T21:57:25,Dadrobit,Yuuuuuup
17-03-2018T21:57:31,unsteddyphoenix,I hate you btw
17-03-2018T21:57:45,Ordithus,"I did engineering on the side as well as the classes, because race car"
17-03-2018T21:58:02,Dadrobit,"I was in the marching band, so it was mandatory parties at least once a week."
17-03-2018T21:58:04,Twokinds,haha
17-03-2018T21:58:08,Bigboi182,I've heard college is a whole different ballgame compared to high school
17-03-2018T21:58:11,Twokinds,college was waaay better than high school for me.
17-03-2018T21:58:11,unsteddyphoenix,As soon as I started highschool my grades went to shit.
17-03-2018T21:58:36,SpazztasticKiwi,College was happier for me than high school
17-03-2018T21:58:38,Bigboi182,Still got a year and a half to find out...
17-03-2018T21:58:40,Twokinds,"I don't like rigid schedules and conformity, man."
17-03-2018T21:58:46,unsteddyphoenix,Fight the system~
17-03-2018T21:58:58,Bigboi182,Me neither.
17-03-2018T21:59:10,Dadrobit,First time through college blew hard. Gave up a ton of scholarship money. This time I love it.
17-03-2018T21:59:15,Bgrmystr2,"jr high and high school were pretty bad for me, but most the teachers don't care, and the students aren't smart enough to care"
17-03-2018T21:59:18,qwe304,*doesnt like schedules* - makes schedules for self anyway
17-03-2018T21:59:26,unsteddyphoenix,R I G I D
17-03-2018T21:59:27,Bigboi182,Homework is absolute HELL.
17-03-2018T21:59:40,SpazztasticKiwi,And look how well he fits to those schedules
17-03-2018T21:59:40,Twokinds,Well it's easy when the person bossing you around is you.
17-03-2018T21:59:47,Bgrmystr2,lol yeh
17-03-2018T21:59:48,unsteddyphoenix,Being able to miss a day if I want to makes keeping up with it easier imo

17-03-2018T22:45:38,Bigboi182,VERY interesting indeed
17-03-2018T22:45:39,Dadrobit,Pizza Pockets lol
17-03-2018T22:45:41,Vatruvius,"Yeah...I had a falling out with my best friend which turned my entire friend group on me. I survived until prom and tried to make new friends and met them at prom only to find the ""talked"" to me at all because of pity. I left to play video games."
17-03-2018T22:45:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Three teachers guarded the punch bowl
17-03-2018T22:46:05,Dadrobit,No roofies then huh?
17-03-2018T22:46:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Vat 😿
17-03-2018T22:46:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"And no roofies, no chance of spiking the punch bowl"
17-03-2018T22:46:49,SpazztasticKiwi,They made sure of that
17-03-2018T22:47:50,Dadrobit,Most vivid memory of prom was probably dancing to Soulja Boy - Crank That
17-03-2018T22:47:57,Bigboi182,"Wow. Rejected by your buddies, that sucks..."
17-03-2018T22:48:08,Dadrobit,Aside form the very friendly slow dances.
17-03-2018T22:48:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’d love a make-up prom. For one, I’ve lost about 27 pounds since high school and I’d probably look better in a dress"
17-03-2018T22:48:22,Vatruvius,Yeah...people suck! My falling out with my best friend was that he asked either myself or my sister to give up our position of a scholarship because he was the runner up and felt he was more diserving of it then either of us.
17-03-2018T22:48:52,Bigboi182,That's pretty selfish. Screw him!
17-03-2018T22:49:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Who needs people? Pets are better
17-03-2018T22:49:30,Bigboi182,"If you got the scholarship, he should be willing to accept that and support you."
17-03-2018T22:49:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Omg. Pet Prom. Everyone gets a dog to dance with
17-03-2018T22:49:52,Bigboi182,Something tells me he was trying to use you all along...
17-03-2018T22:49:57,Vatruvius,"It made me cry, we were friends for years...it was so hard to say to his face I can no longer be friends. The fact everyone else ditched me sucked though."
17-03-2018T22:50:45,Dadrobit,"Yeah, had that happen for an award in band. ""You wouldn't have gotten that scholarship award over me if you didn't write that music on the side."" Props to her for saying it to my face at least."
17-03-2018T22:51:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Some people be bitter
17-03-2018T22:51:19,Vatruvius,Only one person in my class was nice to me afterwards. We were never really friends but she was nice anyway. Only one to sign my senior year book.
17-03-2018T22:51:39,Dadrobit,"Aye. On the plus side, high school is super temporary."
17-03-2018T22:51:50,Bigboi182,"Vat, It's times like these that show who your friends REALLY are. Whether they can back you up when you're against the wall, or they didn't really care in the first place."
17-03-2018T22:52:08,qwe304,im closer to my friends than i am to my family
17-03-2018T22:52:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Same
17-03-2018T22:52:44,Vatruvius,Yeah...some of them I could tell cared but did not wanted to be ousted like me so they did nothing. Fear is a strong motivator.
17-03-2018T22:52:51,Dadrobit,Time wounds all heels. The best way to get back at people earlier in life is to become more successful than them later.
17-03-2018T22:53:14,Bigboi182,"Ok, here's some advice: Separate your 'true' friends from the 'false' ones.  Set up trials so that it is easier"
17-03-2018T22:53:31,Dadrobit,"Two friends enter, One friend leaves!"
17-03-2018T22:53:54,Vatruvius,"Yeah...I plan to be famous, rich, and do a lot of charity. Then I will see all their faces at the reunion. :P"
17-03-2018T22:54:01,Bigboi182,"That's what I'm saying Vat. True friends have your back, no matter what."
17-03-2018T22:54:05,SpazztasticKiwi,The Friending Games
17-03-2018T22:54:22,Bigboi182,That is NOT what I meant.
17-03-2018T22:54:29,Vatruvius,Lol
17-03-2018T22:54:37,Dadrobit,"More a Thunder Dome reference, but sure, may the odds be ever in your favor."
17-03-2018T22:55:46,Bigboi182,"If you don't keep any friends from High School, you'll find new ones in college, who might be even better than them."
17-03-2018T22:57:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’ve had a few people from high school do double takes recognizing me now. Just focus on yourself and move forward. If they want to keep their high school mentality, let them"
17-03-2018T22:57:50,Bigboi182,"Yeah, what Spazz said."
17-03-2018T22:57:50,Vatruvius,No...no showing up in a $1M car and have my own entourage?
17-03-2018T22:57:53,Vatruvius,Brb
17-03-2018T22:57:56,Bgrmystr2,"Don't think that true friends will always tell you what you did was right, cuz that's just kissing your ass."
17-03-2018T22:58:03,Bgrmystr2,A true friend would tell you if you fucked up somewhere
17-03-2018T22:58:10,Bgrmystr2,and stay there and help you fix the shit.
17-03-2018T22:58:22,Dadrobit,That second part's pretty important
17-03-2018T22:58:22,Bigboi182,True as well.
17-03-2018T22:59:20,Bgrmystr2,I know a few people like them
17-03-2018T22:59:22,Bigboi182,"Damn, is it me, or did this conversation get extremely dark?"
17-03-2018T22:59:32,Bgrmystr2,I hold them close like family
17-03-2018T22:59:33,SpazztasticKiwi,We’re just fountains of inspiration
17-03-2018T22:59:36,Bgrmystr2,lolo
17-03-2018T22:59:41,SpazztasticKiwi,And encouragement
17-03-2018T22:59:43,Bigboi182,Yeah
17-03-2018T22:59:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom, got anything to add?"
17-03-2018T23:00:17,Bigboi182,"We won't let a friend down, and we WON'T start today!"
17-03-2018T23:00:30,Dadrobit,"""Screw friends, draw tit-beasts for a living"" -Tom probably"
17-03-2018T23:00:36,Bigboi182,Was he even listening
17-03-2018T23:00:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Despite never seeing each other IRL
17-03-2018T23:00:54,Bigboi182,"lol, that probably is him right now"
17-03-2018T23:00:55,Bgrmystr2,xDD Dadro
17-03-2018T23:01:07,Bigboi182,True Spazz.
17-03-2018T23:01:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"I think like us, life is spent primarily on a computer. Especially socially"
17-03-2018T23:01:39,SpazztasticKiwi,For him
17-03-2018T23:01:41,Bigboi182,yeah
17-03-2018T23:03:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"On a side note, a dog tried biting my tires the other day"
17-03-2018T23:04:16,Bigboi182,Haha
17-03-2018T23:04:36,Bigboi182,A much needed side note
17-03-2018T23:04:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Evidently he’s known to be aggressive
17-03-2018T23:05:55,Bigboi182,I See...
17-03-2018T23:06:54,qwe304,"why are people so scared of dogs? unless they are trained, or utterly massive, they arent a big threat"
17-03-2018T23:07:09,SpazztasticKiwi,This was a bloodhound
17-03-2018T23:07:35,Dadrobit,Media
17-03-2018T23:07:58,Ordithus,"If you don't have a lot of experience with dogs, they can be pretty intimidating"
17-03-2018T23:08:04,Ordithus,Big teeth
17-03-2018T23:08:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you’d almost drowned in a pool, how eager would you be to get back in one?"
17-03-2018T23:08:49,qwe304,"thats all they have, you have arms"
17-03-2018T23:09:21,Ordithus,"People also don't go for the throat, per se or literal"
17-03-2018T23:09:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Generally people are afraid or wary of dogs because they’ve been attacked or around untrained dogs
17-03-2018T23:10:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"You’ve never been bit or attacked by a dog, have you?"
17-03-2018T23:10:09,Dadrobit,"That's a people problem, not the dog's fault."
17-03-2018T23:10:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"Yes, but it still causes the dog to be put down or caged"
17-03-2018T23:10:48,unsteddyphoenix,"dogs dont kill people, dog owners kill people."
17-03-2018T23:10:57,Dadrobit,My first puppy gave me a couple bandages the day I brought him home from the pound lol.
17-03-2018T23:11:05,unsteddyphoenix,d'aw
17-03-2018T23:11:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Baby pup
17-03-2018T23:11:50,Ordithus,"Ha, once I scraped myself up mountain biking.  My friend's curious, teething puppy, nibbled my wound."
17-03-2018T23:11:58,qwe304,"then again, most people are closer to the ground than i am, and are easier targets"
17-03-2018T23:12:43,Dadrobit,"He was a couple months old, almost full grown, but he was a good boy after he got used to living with me."
17-03-2018T23:12:58,Dadrobit,Big 'ol black lab
17-03-2018T23:13:26,qwe304,"ive only seen one dog that i didnt feel confident i could take on, and it was someones 4ft tall german shepard"
17-03-2018T23:14:00,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s over half my height
17-03-2018T23:14:18,qwe304,:thinking:
17-03-2018T23:14:18,Dadrobit,"Sister is part of a pitbull rescue now, always has at least three I can go over and cuddle with whenever I need my dog fix."
17-03-2018T23:14:43,Dadrobit,That's over half of the height of most people tho.
17-03-2018T23:15:02,Ordithus,"The typical person is something less than 8 ft tall, yes"
17-03-2018T23:15:04,Dadrobit,Unless there are a lot of very sneaky 8 ft people walking around in secret
17-03-2018T23:15:31,qwe304,"im 6'4"""
17-03-2018T23:15:46,Bigboi182,I'm almost 6'
17-03-2018T23:16:02,Bigboi182,about half an inch short
17-03-2018T23:16:02,qwe304,im the tallest person at my school
17-03-2018T23:16:06,Twokinds,I'm 8 ft 1
17-03-2018T23:16:07,Dadrobit,Used to be 6'....
17-03-2018T23:16:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"We have a pitbull, a lab/pit, a chihuahua/Pomeranian, and some hyper active, half Pomeranian mix"
17-03-2018T23:16:20,Bgrmystr2,xD Tom
17-03-2018T23:16:30,Bigboi182,DAH! You scared me!
17-03-2018T23:16:36,unsteddyphoenix,They DO exist
17-03-2018T23:16:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom you’ve said befor you’re 5”8, 180 lbs"
17-03-2018T23:16:42,unsteddyphoenix,They just dont go outside...
17-03-2018T23:16:47,Bigboi182,He's joking
17-03-2018T23:16:51,Ordithus,He had a growth spurt
17-03-2018T23:16:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I know this
17-03-2018T23:16:54,qwe304,im 190
17-03-2018T23:16:55,unsteddyphoenix,I like how you have that memorised though
17-03-2018T23:17:01,Dadrobit,Tom is actually just Bean from the Ender series
17-03-2018T23:17:08,SpazztasticKiwi,When can I get that kind of growth spurt
17-03-2018T23:17:21,Bgrmystr2,internet.
17-03-2018T23:17:25,unsteddyphoenix,mystery food
17-03-2018T23:17:27,Ordithus,"Real talk, I don't think you want to be that tall"
17-03-2018T23:17:29,SpazztasticKiwi,And how the hell do you fit in your house? Aren’t you the tallest?
17-03-2018T23:17:29,Bigboi182,I have people who are in the grade above me but are the height of a large bush.
17-03-2018T23:17:31,Dadrobit,Steroids and bone stretching.
17-03-2018T23:17:43,Bigboi182,Yeah
17-03-2018T23:17:51,Bgrmystr2,"""a large bush"""
17-03-2018T23:17:54,unsteddyphoenix,steroids make you taller?
17-03-2018T23:17:54,Bgrmystr2,could you be any more vague?
17-03-2018T23:17:57,qwe304,i am smack dab in the normal range (bmi)
17-03-2018T23:17:57,unsteddyphoenix,Interesting...
17-03-2018T23:18:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"Me remembering that may seem creepy, yes, but I say it’s because I have a good memory"
17-03-2018T23:18:23,Bigboi182,"Like, one that's about 4 feet tall..."
17-03-2018T23:18:34,unsteddyphoenix,Quick whens Toms birthday

17-03-2018T23:19:11,unsteddyphoenix,"Still a while, then."
17-03-2018T23:19:17,Dadrobit,To support the extra bone form the stretching.
17-03-2018T23:19:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"But yeah, 8”1? Awful difficult to fit in a house"
17-03-2018T23:19:25,Bgrmystr2,I'll be 30 before he turns 31
17-03-2018T23:19:31,Ordithus,Same bgr

17-03-2018T23:20:28,Ordithus,"I get a few months, woot"
17-03-2018T23:20:29,Bigboi182,"You get to reach the ""I'm old, but not really"" phase of your life"
17-03-2018T23:20:42,unsteddyphoenix,thats no fun
17-03-2018T23:20:45,Ordithus,This is so important to me
17-03-2018T23:20:49,SpazztasticKiwi,The only info I know on Tom is on that site or what Mark’s spilled in his videos
17-03-2018T23:20:52,unsteddyphoenix,As it should be Ord
17-03-2018T23:20:52,Bgrmystr2,lol ord
17-03-2018T23:20:57,Bigboi182,Where people start seeing 30 as being pretty old
17-03-2018T23:21:08,Bigboi182,yeah
17-03-2018T23:21:14,Bgrmystr2,I know so many people who think low 20s is old
17-03-2018T23:21:14,Bgrmystr2,:P
17-03-2018T23:21:16,Bigboi182,Tom's pretty quiet
17-03-2018T23:21:21,Bigboi182,True
17-03-2018T23:21:28,Bgrmystr2,I also know people who think old doesn't start till you're like 50
17-03-2018T23:21:32,Bgrmystr2,so.. yknow
17-03-2018T23:21:33,SpazztasticKiwi,More like “practicing mime”
17-03-2018T23:21:34,Bigboi182,wow
17-03-2018T23:21:35,unsteddyphoenix,Feels old man
17-03-2018T23:21:36,Bgrmystr2,I guess it depends
17-03-2018T23:21:42,Dadrobit,"Hahahahaha, I remember looking at people in their 20's as being ""mature"""
17-03-2018T23:21:59,Bigboi182,Depends on how you've lived your life.
17-03-2018T23:22:00,Bgrmystr2,mature compared to the teenagers and kids
17-03-2018T23:22:01,unsteddyphoenix,im hella mature bro
17-03-2018T23:22:02,Ordithus,I remember thinking high schoolers were mature... oh how young and naive I was
17-03-2018T23:22:24,Ordithus,"The ""mature"" mark continues to get older"
17-03-2018T23:22:38,Bigboi182,"Nope, they can still be as insane as possible, just a little less than before"
17-03-2018T23:22:42,Bgrmystr2,My mature mark never changed
17-03-2018T23:22:46,Bigboi182,yep
17-03-2018T23:22:48,Bgrmystr2,because I never gave it an age
17-03-2018T23:22:50,Ordithus,My mature mark is about my age +10
17-03-2018T23:22:53,Bgrmystr2,age is irrelevant to maturity
17-03-2018T23:23:01,Bigboi182,yep
17-03-2018T23:23:05,Bgrmystr2,"it's actions, choices"
17-03-2018T23:23:09,Bgrmystr2,not lifetime spent
17-03-2018T23:23:15,SpazztasticKiwi,We never become adults; we just learn how to act in public
17-03-2018T23:23:38,Bigboi182,depend on whether you decide to grow up and take on life's responsibilites or not
17-03-2018T23:24:00,qwe304,"im immature af, but woke"
17-03-2018T23:24:02,Bigboi182,Something I'm struggling to do right now.
17-03-2018T23:24:05,Bgrmystr2,"for the most part, life can fuck off :V It gave me sour lemons"
17-03-2018T23:24:12,Bgrmystr2,the fuck am I supposed to do with these lol
17-03-2018T23:24:14,Ordithus,I like lemons
17-03-2018T23:24:22,Ordithus,Eat em
17-03-2018T23:24:26,Bgrmystr2,ew no
17-03-2018T23:24:28,Bgrmystr2,are you mad
17-03-2018T23:24:37,Ordithus,"Possibly, but probably not because of that."
17-03-2018T23:24:53,Bigboi182,"'Cause it's like midnight where I live, and I still haven't slept yet"
17-03-2018T23:24:56,Bgrmystr2,"No, it's likely because you are mad that you like lemons"
17-03-2018T23:25:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Add sugar (a partner) and water (a stable career) and make lemonade (kids/a valuable life)
17-03-2018T23:25:18,Bgrmystr2,lol bigboi living up to your name
17-03-2018T23:25:26,Bgrmystr2,midnight sooo late :v
17-03-2018T23:25:36,Bigboi182,yep
17-03-2018T23:25:41,Bgrmystr2,yeh.. naw

17-03-2018T23:34:16,SpazztasticKiwi,You missed Tom’s growth spurt
17-03-2018T23:35:39,Vatruvius,A growth spurt...you mean he is not short...I mean...TALL like Mark? *looking around to see if anyone caught my mistake...SHIT!*
17-03-2018T23:36:54,SpazztasticKiwi,He went from almost 6 feet to being eight
17-03-2018T23:37:09,SpazztasticKiwi,And he’s taller than Mark anyway
17-03-2018T23:37:33,Bgrmystr2,back
17-03-2018T23:37:47,Vatruvius,"Nice...awsome growth spurt. Would be painfull I would imagine. I myself am 5' 11"""
17-03-2018T23:38:30,Ordithus,wb Bgr
17-03-2018T23:38:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m starting to feel Mark’s pain
17-03-2018T23:38:40,Vatruvius,"Poor Mark, he is so small when standing next to Bob and Wade."
17-03-2018T23:38:42,Ordithus,"Good night, all! :ctwokinds-RainezZz:"
17-03-2018T23:38:55,Vatruvius,Goodnight!

17-03-2018T23:40:50,Bgrmystr2,gnight ord
17-03-2018T23:43:24,SpazztasticKiwi,👋🏻
17-03-2018T23:45:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"And yes, he seems shorter near Bob and Wade, but that’s because they’re over 6 feet"
17-03-2018T23:46:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Plenty of people look shorter than them. Mark’s pretty average
17-03-2018T23:48:04,Vatruvius,"Yeah...I think I like the femMike sketch the most this stream. It is pretty funny, ""I will PAINT you!"" I keep thinking of Liam Neeson voicing Eric in that scene."
17-03-2018T23:49:55,unsteddyphoenix,its from The Shining.
17-03-2018T23:51:44,Vatruvius,"Yeah, I am aware of what you are talking about but I never really watched that film."
17-03-2018T23:52:39,Vatruvius,"But a calm, collected Liam Neeson saying that to femMike over a phone..."
17-03-2018T23:53:22,Vatruvius,"""I will find you and I will PAINT you."""
17-03-2018T23:53:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Eric: gotta paint em all!
17-03-2018T23:54:54,Vatruvius,Anyone see where that Clovis/Keith suggestion came from? Seemed like it came out of left field and shot everything else down.
