31-07-2018T00:20:26,TheGamePlayer,XD I just crashed threw the Luigi pizza billboard with my character. He flew right threw and took it down
31-07-2018T00:44:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I just remembered we sell chicken biscuits at work and now I’m slightly more ready to go for work
31-07-2018T00:55:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m gonna try going on bed now
31-07-2018T00:56:35,SpazztasticKiwi,You have fun with that work Tom & nighty night everyone
31-07-2018T01:14:15,Bgrmystr2,Ah.. the latest image tom posted on patreon is a jpg instead of a png
31-07-2018T01:14:17,Bgrmystr2,rip
31-07-2018T01:14:23,Bgrmystr2,:(
31-07-2018T01:32:28,Twokinds,whoops
31-07-2018T01:33:22,iliar,And what's the problem with JPG?
31-07-2018T01:34:20,iliar,I noticed this. But I do not see any problems with JPG.
31-07-2018T01:37:07,unsteddyphoenix,Short answer is PNGs are higher quality than JPGs and dont lose any quality when theyre saved then opened again.
31-07-2018T01:49:47,Bgrmystr2,"Phoenix is right. Also, PNG uses a different format to save than JPGs"
31-07-2018T01:49:54,iliar,"In theory, you are right."
31-07-2018T01:50:20,Bgrmystr2,"it's not just theory, it's effective in practice too"
31-07-2018T01:50:22,iliar,https://yadi.sk/i/bgjfweSb3ZnGbQ
31-07-2018T01:50:39,Bgrmystr2,"JPGs use pixels for their data, while PNGs do not"
31-07-2018T01:50:55,Bgrmystr2,"so if you increase the size of a jpg, you end up with jpeg artifacts as it were"
31-07-2018T01:51:11,Bgrmystr2,making the image unclear and not very nice to look at
31-07-2018T01:51:40,Bgrmystr2,but pngs can have their size increased far more while still retaining similar quality
31-07-2018T01:53:00,iliar,I took PNG. He saved it as JPG. Then I connected the two versions together and saved them as PNG. Can you say that the right side of the frame is an original PNG or JPG?
31-07-2018T01:54:50,Bgrmystr2,"for what you did, it'd be hard to tell, but that's because you're not actually giving it a fair comparison to begin with xD"
31-07-2018T01:57:33,iliar,"Why difficult. In theory, half of the image that was saved in the JPG must have terrible artifacts."
31-07-2018T01:59:23,Bgrmystr2,"Like I said, you didn't give it a fair comparison, so it's not going to be easy to tell with how you did it"
31-07-2018T02:01:45,Bgrmystr2,This is zoomed in on the jpeg and png version. You can easily tell which one is which https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/250139544517607424/474109330640338945/dllhost_2018-08-01_02-00-53.png
31-07-2018T02:03:10,Bgrmystr2,one has artifacts and jagged lines
31-07-2018T02:03:16,Bgrmystr2,the other is not as bad
31-07-2018T02:03:36,unsteddyphoenix,^
31-07-2018T02:03:44,iliar,Okay. How about this test. I save PNG as JPG. And then I save both versions as BMP. You can tell which of these two files have JPG artifacts?
31-07-2018T02:03:57,iliar,https://yadi.sk/i/RfXrJ_jR3ZnHtP
31-07-2018T02:04:11,iliar,https://yadi.sk/i/0D_-SNhh3ZnHuk
31-07-2018T02:04:12,unsteddyphoenix,I think bgrs already made the point lol
31-07-2018T02:05:32,iliar,"Your example is stupid. Because the JPG quality depends on settings. If you choose the worst settings, the artifacts will be horrible."
31-07-2018T02:07:03,Bgrmystr2,"It's not stupid, Iliar. That's how it works. Jpgs are coded different from PNGs in how they save the image data."
31-07-2018T02:07:22,Bgrmystr2,100% jpg quality will still have artifacts
31-07-2018T02:07:32,Bgrmystr2,if expanded enough
31-07-2018T02:07:52,Bgrmystr2,and will degrade in quality if you change it
31-07-2018T02:07:55,iliar,You did not answer. Which of the two BMP files have JPG artifacts?
31-07-2018T02:08:05,Bgrmystr2,they both do iliar
31-07-2018T02:08:26,iliar,Really?
31-07-2018T02:09:16,Bgrmystr2,yeah. they do
31-07-2018T02:09:23,Bgrmystr2,and it's really bad
31-07-2018T02:09:31,unsteddyphoenix,LOL wow Iliar
31-07-2018T02:09:57,unsteddyphoenix,That's so cheeky lmao
31-07-2018T02:10:06,Bgrmystr2,xD
31-07-2018T02:10:16,unsteddyphoenix,I honestly didnt bother checking
31-07-2018T02:10:17,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha
31-07-2018T02:10:40,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. you save a png as a jpg.. of course it's going to gain artifacts
31-07-2018T02:11:28,Bgrmystr2,and then from jpg to bmp just increases the file size really cuz they both save the image data the same way if I recall correctly
31-07-2018T02:11:35,Bgrmystr2,or close to it
31-07-2018T02:12:51,iliar,But in another version I saved png as a bmp. In this version should not contain artifacts.
31-07-2018T02:13:12,Bgrmystr2,bmp is based on pixels just like jpegs are
31-07-2018T02:13:34,Bgrmystr2,bitmaps are what ppl use to make like pixel art and stuff xD
31-07-2018T02:14:20,iliar,Why do you think that another version also has JPG artifacts?
31-07-2018T02:15:49,iliar,png is based on pixels foo. png is not vector image.
31-07-2018T02:15:53,Bgrmystr2,"the only reason they're called jpeg artifacts is because when you increase a jpeg in size, the pixels aren't suited for upscale"
31-07-2018T02:16:14,Bgrmystr2,bitmaps get artifacts too
31-07-2018T02:16:45,Bgrmystr2,"of course png is based on pixels, but it stores the image data differently than standard ones like jpg and such"
31-07-2018T02:16:56,Bgrmystr2,"it also saves a lot more, tis why they're bigger"
31-07-2018T02:17:08,Bgrmystr2,jpegs are compressed to save space
31-07-2018T02:17:15,Bgrmystr2,a lot of space.
31-07-2018T02:17:23,SiliconCarbide,"and that compression is lossy, thats why you get artifacts"
31-07-2018T02:17:35,SiliconCarbide,"specifically sharp transitions in color space cause something called ""ringing"""
31-07-2018T02:17:55,SiliconCarbide,because the compression algorithm is based on a fourier decomposition of pixel space
31-07-2018T02:18:29,SiliconCarbide,its much less noticeable on pictures with soft transitions
31-07-2018T02:18:34,SiliconCarbide,as is typical for photographs
31-07-2018T02:18:48,iliar,BMP is a format without compression and without loss. I save PNG as BMP. Why do you think that this file has JPG artifacts?
31-07-2018T02:19:37,Bgrmystr2,because I can SEE artifacts in both images you posted xD
31-07-2018T02:19:51,Bgrmystr2,I have eyes!
31-07-2018T02:19:56,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-excited:
31-07-2018T02:20:43,iliar,"Just in case, I want to clarify. Do you know what this button does? https://yadi.sk/i/UyB889nE3ZnKrH"
31-07-2018T02:21:18,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, I do"
31-07-2018T02:22:59,iliar,And did you save the file before opening it?
31-07-2018T02:23:13,Bgrmystr2,the site has the full image displayed
31-07-2018T02:23:57,Bgrmystr2,"when you click it, it gives a preview"
31-07-2018T02:24:01,iliar,You a an idiot.
31-07-2018T02:24:23,iliar,You looked at the preview of the file.
31-07-2018T02:24:55,Bgrmystr2,please tell me you're joking. the file is going to be the same thing. I'll go download the thing right now and go to the same spot
31-07-2018T02:25:00,Bgrmystr2,and find the same artifacts
31-07-2018T02:25:01,iliar,Preview in JPG.
31-07-2018T02:26:25,iliar,Download the BPM files and compare them again.
31-07-2018T02:27:29,Bgrmystr2,"I did, and I can see artifcts in both, though A is much less so, going to presume A was the PNG"
31-07-2018T02:29:26,Bgrmystr2,"Also, comparing it to the original png, the bitmap of A has a worse transition"
31-07-2018T02:29:31,Bgrmystr2,from one color to another
31-07-2018T02:29:39,Bgrmystr2,it's abrupt
31-07-2018T02:29:58,Bgrmystr2,like the boy's hair to keith's  shirt
31-07-2018T02:30:19,iliar,"You're right. But in my opinion, the difference is very small, that would be greatly upset getting JPG version."
31-07-2018T02:30:56,Bgrmystr2,"many people upscale the images and use them for wallpapers, or print them and have them framed on their wall"
31-07-2018T02:31:11,Bgrmystr2,so it being a jpg kind of removes both of those possibilities
31-07-2018T02:32:37,iliar,"Я не понимаю, что ты имеешь в виду? https://yadi.sk/i/SmIghNw-3ZnMG4"
31-07-2018T02:34:13,iliar,JPG removes?
31-07-2018T02:35:21,iliar,"When you print a poster, the biggest problem is a low resolution."
31-07-2018T02:36:08,iliar,"JPG does a little worse, but is not a big problem."
31-07-2018T02:40:24,Bgrmystr2,I'm just going to leave this here http://www.differencebetween.info/difference-between-bmp-and-png
31-07-2018T02:40:28,Bgrmystr2,"and this ""Also, as a bitmap image is a pixel by pixel image, if one tries to zoom in or enhance a bitmap picture, the image seems pixilated."""
31-07-2018T02:42:33,Bgrmystr2,"jpg isn't a problem if it's big enough where the size won't give you artifacts, but generally it will because it doesn't save all the data in a jpg"
31-07-2018T02:43:24,Bgrmystr2,"kind of like lossy audio, the more you save and transfer it, the more distorted the sound becomes"
31-07-2018T02:43:29,Bgrmystr2,jpgs do the same
31-07-2018T02:46:48,iliar,"If you compare the original PSD and public PNG then you will realize - the biggest problem, Tom publish result in less resolution. https://yadi.sk/i/am6zL5XM3ZnP7F"
31-07-2018T02:47:41,iliar,"In comparison with this, the difference between PNG and JPG very low."
31-07-2018T02:50:38,Bgrmystr2,"of course resolution is a big factor, but that's a completely separate thing that can both combine and compound the problems with a jpg lol"
31-07-2018T03:14:05,iliar,"In my opinion, the dispute between JPG and PNG looks like a dispute, which is better than Cola with a temperature of 24.8 °C or 25.1 °C. In theory, 24.8 °C is cooler and means better. But in my opinion it does not matter, because both versions are warm"
31-07-2018T03:46:54,Bgrmystr2,I guess you just don't have a lot of background in seeing the difference a png can make
31-07-2018T04:15:08,iliar,I have 4k monitor. Does it counts?
31-07-2018T04:17:19,Bgrmystr2,Well I mean like.. spanning the course of two dozen years collecting images and seeing the difference
31-07-2018T04:17:45,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, just about 24 years now.."
