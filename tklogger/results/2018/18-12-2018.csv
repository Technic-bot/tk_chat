18-12-2018T00:25:12,iliar,* It is urgent to think of what good I have done. I also want to receive congratulations from Tom. But all what I do is procrastination.

18-12-2018T00:28:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve done near flawless ones in the past but it’s been awhile

18-12-2018T01:19:45,RimaDraws,no no I'm good. but i am getting there
18-12-2018T01:20:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"The longer I look at it, the less I kinda like it, ya know. I tweaked one and made it kinda worse before that picture"

18-12-2018T10:48:10,RimaDraws,man these cats can romp
18-12-2018T10:53:46,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s fortunate enough he made it in one piece though - that stands to be said
18-12-2018T10:55:25,SpazztasticKiwi,But I gotta go. They got me goin in earlier
18-12-2018T11:03:15,MrMongMong,"Wouldn't it be ironic if Tom's brother finally arrived, only to find all the doors to the house locked."
18-12-2018T11:03:20,MrMongMong,And no one home.
18-12-2018T11:12:37,RimaDraws,lol oh no
18-12-2018T11:12:43,RimaDraws,oki kiwi
18-12-2018T11:12:58,RimaDraws,i just had to wash winter's paws off. she stepped in my puzzle glue.
18-12-2018T11:25:42,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-katdryer:
18-12-2018T11:25:54,RimaDraws,yea now these two are romping around
18-12-2018T11:40:06,CrimsonQuill,"Hello Tom! I scrolled up through the chat-How are you, and how's Mark?"
18-12-2018T11:40:10,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-greetings::ptv-greetings:
18-12-2018T11:44:46,Dadrobit,I don't even know how irritated I am anymore. This is just a whole 'nother level. My audio interface company finally got back to me about getting a driver for my system that won't BSoD on me and fix the CPU throttling this morning.
18-12-2018T11:45:37,Dadrobit,"Immediately after downloading, the CPU throttling persisted, and it didn't take 5 minutes for it to BSoD on me again. Then twice more trying to boot back up."
18-12-2018T11:46:17,Dadrobit,It's some serious next level bullshittery.
18-12-2018T11:47:28,RimaDraws,ouch dadro sorry
18-12-2018T11:47:40,Dadrobit,"The dmp files that were created as a result of the crashes specify the audio interface drivers as the issue, so they got sent off to their tech support, hopefully they can parse them and figure out exactly wtf is going on."
18-12-2018T11:48:56,RimaDraws,i hope so. is this the same laptop that is giving you trouble?
18-12-2018T11:49:35,Dadrobit,"This happened across two different laptops, so it's the drivers. Or (hopefully not!) the iterface itself."
18-12-2018T11:49:44,RimaDraws,so different ones wow
18-12-2018T11:51:57,Dadrobit,"The repair shop was able to get my original laptop working agian through ""resetting some drivers"". The laptop functioned just fine as it always had UNTIL I tried reinstalling the interface drivers and then it all went to shit again."
18-12-2018T11:52:17,RimaDraws,oh that sucks butt
18-12-2018T11:52:50,Dadrobit,And the new laptop I got while the old one was in the shop had the same issue with crashing starting after the drivers installed.
18-12-2018T11:56:29,RimaDraws,something must be corrupted in those drivers?
18-12-2018T11:57:59,Dadrobit,"I deleted the old ones and started fresh. Likely, it's that it's conflicting with something somewhere else. Though Hell if I know where. I already disabled all the stock audio drivers and tested that to no avail as well."
18-12-2018T11:58:36,RimaDraws,It's really hard to tell without more diagnosis

18-12-2018T12:03:18,RimaDraws,like get to the root of the problem
18-12-2018T12:10:35,Dadrobit,"Aye, I know that ""The problem seems to be caused by the following file: FocusriteUSB.sys  SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED"" means that the Focusrite driver is being fucky, but after deleting it, reinstalling, and rebooting, I am at a loss for why."

18-12-2018T15:13:28,RimaDraws,looks great but i had hoped it would be in color oh well. ill look forward to the rest
18-12-2018T15:15:36,Twokinds,Well I did call them sketch comics
18-12-2018T15:15:50,RimaDraws,i didn't remember hearing that but its okay.
18-12-2018T15:16:24,RimaDraws,as long as they're fun.
18-12-2018T15:17:32,RimaDraws,i got to finally enjoy flipping through the art book earlier.
18-12-2018T15:17:46,Twokinds,It's the only way I can do both the main comic and these at the same time.
18-12-2018T15:18:16,RimaDraws,that is true. saves time which is what i would go for.
18-12-2018T15:18:37,RimaDraws,im still debating if i should do mine in color.
18-12-2018T15:19:52,RimaDraws,i think my sinuses are hitting me hard today...

18-12-2018T17:40:14,Twokinds,Woah
18-12-2018T17:40:24,Twokinds,There's an enormous bird outside.
18-12-2018T17:40:27,Twokinds,I think it's an owl.
18-12-2018T17:40:37,SpazztasticKiwi,You think
18-12-2018T17:40:38,Twokinds,It's like... the Zelda owl.
18-12-2018T17:40:50,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s Big Bird
18-12-2018T17:40:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Ba dum tiss
18-12-2018T17:41:11,Twokinds,It's dark outside so all I could see is its silhouette.
18-12-2018T17:41:13,Xexanoth,Would you like me to repeat that?
18-12-2018T17:41:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe it’s a message from mark. He’s reported his car died
18-12-2018T17:42:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Though by now he’s likely ok
18-12-2018T17:42:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Messages via giant owl. Very logical
18-12-2018T17:42:44,Twokinds,"I dunno, he's not here yet."
18-12-2018T17:43:09,Bgrmystr2,Harry Potter Owl?
18-12-2018T17:43:12,Bgrmystr2,maybe.
18-12-2018T17:43:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn’t figure. He said he’d likely be there sometime tonight and start up vids first thing in the morning
18-12-2018T17:44:13,Bgrmystr2,ooo yelling all loud in the morning
18-12-2018T17:44:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t know how he always gets up at the ass crack of dawn

18-12-2018T18:06:18,Dadrobit,Browser reset doesn't fix it. Computer reset doesn't fix it. CCleaner app wipe doesn't fix it...
18-12-2018T18:07:05,unsteddyphoenix,Reinstall the website
