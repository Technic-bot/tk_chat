21-08-2018T00:51:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Good news is I’ve sort of figured out the contour part but the God forsaken beard is what’s irritating me
21-08-2018T00:53:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Ignore that
21-08-2018T02:42:23,TheBeckoner,well Im sure im missing context but I'd find it interesting if you'd grow a beard.
21-08-2018T02:42:32,TheBeckoner,grown*
21-08-2018T03:30:04,Dadrobit,First time beards do tend to leave the user(s) with a bit of irritation.
21-08-2018T03:39:24,TheBeckoner,Thats why I give up before I get there
21-08-2018T03:49:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Fake beard. If you really want to know - I’ve been practicing cross dress makeup
21-08-2018T03:50:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t figure any of you would want to talk makeup
21-08-2018T03:51:30,Bgrmystr2,"I look at my face in the mirror.. say ""Feh, good enough"""
21-08-2018T03:51:41,Bgrmystr2,and don't pay a cent in makeup
21-08-2018T03:51:43,Bgrmystr2,:)
21-08-2018T04:12:19,TheBeckoner,mmh yeah never dealt with makeup
21-08-2018T04:26:08,Dadrobit,I buy expensive body wash if that counts?
21-08-2018T04:28:04,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, I'd say no"
21-08-2018T04:33:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Only if it’s more like body shimmer spray
21-08-2018T04:33:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"If it washes off and is soap, no"
21-08-2018T04:34:12,unsteddyphoenix,is there glitter bodywash
21-08-2018T04:34:19,Bgrmystr2,probably.
21-08-2018T04:34:19,unsteddyphoenix,That's a million dollar idea
21-08-2018T04:35:14,Bgrmystr2,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Tone-Body-Wash-Radiant-Glow-16-Ounce/43372543 this exists

21-08-2018T04:35:32,Bgrmystr2,I guess it's possible
21-08-2018T04:35:41,unsteddyphoenix,confirmed makeup bodywash
21-08-2018T04:36:10,Bgrmystr2,haha
21-08-2018T04:39:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"Most of it washes off, but if you take morning showers, you’d have a bit of glitter on you for the day"
21-08-2018T04:40:20,unsteddyphoenix,sounds f a b u l o u s
21-08-2018T04:42:32,Dadrobit,"Hmmm, I think I'll stick to smelling like the man your man could smell like."

21-08-2018T16:44:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Well if you wanna split hairs....
21-08-2018T16:46:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"Speaking of splitting hairs, and I know this is an odd and off the wall question, but would you guys consider that toothpaste is tooth soap?"
21-08-2018T16:53:42,Dadrobit,Not realy considering that they make literal tooth soap.
21-08-2018T17:30:06,SpazztasticKiwi,You mean that charcoal stuff
21-08-2018T18:32:21,unsteddyphoenix,What...use does tooth soap have

21-08-2018T22:55:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Does anyone cook or top their food with anything other than avocado anymore? Seems that’s the only garnish I see photographed anymore
21-08-2018T22:58:20,Bgrmystr2,maybe most people just.. don't photograph their food?
21-08-2018T22:59:11,unsteddyphoenix,Those people will never be able to afford houses if they keep up that haphazard spending
