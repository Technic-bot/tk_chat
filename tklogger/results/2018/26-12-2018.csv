26-12-2018T00:00:58,SpazztasticKiwi,How many times did you die
26-12-2018T00:01:51,Dadrobit,Twice I think? Asphyxiation's a bitch.
26-12-2018T00:02:34,Dadrobit,Came close to a third with a teleporting water Scyther gave me a minor heart attack.

26-12-2018T00:05:48,Dadrobit,"I've only seen like 20 seconds of a playthrough, so I'm doing this rather very blind. Took me forever to figure out how to get a dang knife."
26-12-2018T00:06:54,Dadrobit,"Also, I had a rather sizeable mudslide earlier, so my cognitive faculties aren't exactly at 100%"
26-12-2018T00:07:20,Ordithus,Best time to play
26-12-2018T00:07:36,Dadrobit,o/ Trace
26-12-2018T00:07:43,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I dont really know much either. Only that it gets scary?
26-12-2018T00:07:49,Dadrobit,When it's dark? Or when you're tipsy?
26-12-2018T00:08:00,Ordithus,Both?  Maybe?
26-12-2018T00:08:05,unsteddyphoenix,Ehh~ we'll see
26-12-2018T00:08:11,Ordithus,never played subnautica either
26-12-2018T00:08:28,unsteddyphoenix,Hey I heard from a friend that it's free right now! :D
26-12-2018T00:08:35,Dadrobit,"Can confirm, some bits were startling. Not particularly ""scary""yet though?"
26-12-2018T00:08:59,unsteddyphoenix,Shrug~

26-12-2018T00:10:12,unsteddyphoenix,AAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaahey what's up
26-12-2018T00:10:16,Dadrobit,"Sound design so far is really rather good. I'm wearing good cans, so hearing the bleeps bloops and screams of my ex girlfriend are all coming through really clearly."
26-12-2018T00:10:26,SpazztasticKiwi,And the teleporting water scythers are called Warpers
26-12-2018T00:10:37,unsteddyphoenix,Wait what was that second one
26-12-2018T00:10:51,Dadrobit,bloops?
26-12-2018T00:11:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Who‚Äôd they cast your ex as? The reapers?
26-12-2018T00:11:20,unsteddyphoenix,The screams of...nevermind actually.
26-12-2018T00:11:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Which reminds me - you seen a reaper yet?
26-12-2018T00:11:59,Dadrobit,Maybe? Describe it in terms of Pokemon and I might understand.
26-12-2018T00:12:16,SpazztasticKiwi,One scary mf
26-12-2018T00:12:33,unsteddyphoenix,thats not a pokemon
26-12-2018T00:12:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Always angry and ready to feck you up
26-12-2018T00:12:55,Dadrobit,"That's like, a third of everything in this game?"
26-12-2018T00:13:11,unsteddyphoenix,mewtwo?
26-12-2018T00:13:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"There‚Äôs not really a pokemon that looks like a reaper. Just know if you hear a scary ass roar, it can see you and you need to gtfo"
26-12-2018T00:14:04,Bgrmystr2,it's like.. meeting a gyarados.. but it's 1:1 scale and the motherfucker hangry.
26-12-2018T00:14:04,Dadrobit,Duskull kinda looks like a reaper
26-12-2018T00:14:06,SpazztasticKiwi,And don‚Äôt get me started on the other leviathan species in the game
26-12-2018T00:14:53,Dadrobit,I met one leviathan style water friend. He was mostly hramless.
26-12-2018T00:14:58,Dadrobit,harmless*
26-12-2018T00:15:15,SpazztasticKiwi,You sure it was a leviathan?
26-12-2018T00:15:29,Dadrobit,He did have one tiger plant on his back that was very angry though.
26-12-2018T00:15:50,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it was registered under leviathan class."
26-12-2018T00:16:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Are they flat and kinda manta ray/jellyfish lookin?
26-12-2018T00:16:43,Twokinds,reefback
26-12-2018T00:17:01,Twokinds,Always glad to see them.
26-12-2018T00:17:08,Twokinds,Usually means nothing too dangerous around.
26-12-2018T00:17:34,Dadrobit,"Yeah, Reefback was the thing."
26-12-2018T00:17:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Figured
26-12-2018T00:18:03,SpazztasticKiwi,The big thing that doesn‚Äôt wants bite outta your ass
26-12-2018T00:18:22,Dadrobit,"Also, there's supposedly a rescue ship en route in the next 30 minutes. But I'm not holding out too much hope. Literally everything that can go wrong has gone wrong."
26-12-2018T00:18:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh that‚Äôll be entertaining for you to see
26-12-2018T00:18:47,Dadrobit,"Also, I might be sick? Did a self scan and found ""statistically abnormal evels of bacteria""."
26-12-2018T00:18:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Just go to the extraction point when it tells you
26-12-2018T00:18:51,Ordithus,I'm sure everything will go fine
26-12-2018T00:19:03,SpazztasticKiwi,The sickness is part of the story
26-12-2018T00:19:23,Dadrobit,"Well then, I guess I'm down with the sickness."
26-12-2018T00:19:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"Not sure how much you know and thanks to who I follow, I know the story"
26-12-2018T00:19:27,Ordithus,See a doctor
26-12-2018T00:19:29,unsteddyphoenix,Wish you all the best for your sickness dad
26-12-2018T00:19:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"If there‚Äôs no blood or bone showing, you‚Äôre fine"
26-12-2018T00:20:06,Dadrobit,I know literally nothing. I saw some tiny clips of the game over a year ago.
26-12-2018T00:20:31,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs a trip. I‚Äôll tell you stuff but only if you ask
26-12-2018T00:20:40,Bgrmystr2,"but that's spoilers, kiwi"
26-12-2018T00:20:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Like if you want help
26-12-2018T00:20:51,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúHow do I‚Äù
26-12-2018T00:20:54,Ordithus,"spoilers add 5 horsepower, brah"
26-12-2018T00:21:32,SpazztasticKiwi,And I‚Äôll give spoilers yes. But ONLY if you‚Äôre really really ok with it. Finding out the game for yourself is the best part
26-12-2018T00:22:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Number one way people seem to die though is they forget to breathe
26-12-2018T00:22:36,unsteddyphoenix,relatable
26-12-2018T00:22:41,Ordithus,Gets me all the time
26-12-2018T00:23:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Or they think ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a big scary monster. Imma try n pet it - maybe it‚Äôs friendly‚Äù
26-12-2018T00:23:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Spoiler: it‚Äôs not friendly
26-12-2018T00:23:25,unsteddyphoenix,Both get me all the time
26-12-2018T00:26:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I need to stop eating chocolate before bed
26-12-2018T00:28:20,Dadrobit,"Nah, I'm doing this all blind, but thank you."
26-12-2018T00:29:15,Dadrobit,I learned my lesson from playing with the water scyther heavy petting session.

26-12-2018T00:29:41,Dadrobit,"""Always look with ways before crossing the reef"""
26-12-2018T00:29:58,Dadrobit,Super important lesson there
26-12-2018T00:34:37,SpazztasticKiwi,At least that make a noise before you see em
26-12-2018T00:34:41,SpazztasticKiwi,they

26-12-2018T08:46:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Go back to bed
26-12-2018T08:46:36,RimaDraws,Yeap but I‚Äôm up and I already slept my six hours
26-12-2018T08:46:45,RimaDraws,The wind woke me up

26-12-2018T10:31:07,iliar,"Good morning, Tom!"
26-12-2018T10:32:12,iliar,"Tom, I have long wanted to ask. Some people say you studied nuclear physics. It's true?"
26-12-2018T10:32:29,RimaDraws,morning tom
26-12-2018T10:32:50,Twokinds,Haha
26-12-2018T10:33:10,Twokinds,I don't know where people come up with these things.
26-12-2018T10:33:23,RimaDraws,what did you study?
26-12-2018T10:33:39,Twokinds,Radiation Therapy.
26-12-2018T10:33:44,RimaDraws,oh cool
26-12-2018T10:33:55,RimaDraws,that sounds like it would be a great job
26-12-2018T10:34:16,RimaDraws,i almost went into pre physical therapy but it wasnt what i wanted
26-12-2018T10:34:23,iliar,I also found it strange. But just in case I wanted to clarify.
26-12-2018T10:34:25,Twokinds,"Yeah, I'm sure it would have been. Hospital work pays well, generally."
26-12-2018T10:34:33,Twokinds,But it just ended up not being for me.
26-12-2018T10:34:39,RimaDraws,it really does but the hours are terrible
26-12-2018T10:34:51,RimaDraws,i mean art is your thing for sure
26-12-2018T10:35:11,RimaDraws,im hoping it can be my thing too
26-12-2018T10:36:07,Twokinds,"Would have been cool to be Dr Fischbach, but I'm not going through all that med school and long hours."
26-12-2018T10:36:32,RimaDraws,my cousin is in med school to be a nurse and she had like 13 papers
26-12-2018T10:36:35,RimaDraws,to write
26-12-2018T10:39:18,iliar,Although I hoped that I would be able to boast of my DIY gamma spectrometer.
26-12-2018T10:42:33,RimaDraws,i want to be a college art professor
26-12-2018T10:48:30,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
26-12-2018T11:07:05,Twokinds,Eugh
26-12-2018T11:08:14,Twokinds,"Tried ""sugar free marmalade"" on my toast this morning. It's awful. I can taste the Splenda."
26-12-2018T11:09:01,TerraTheWizard,oof
26-12-2018T11:15:18,iliar,"When I wanted to lose weight, I bought Diet Coke. It's horrible. I don't know who buys it."
26-12-2018T11:15:34,RimaDraws,ew splenda
26-12-2018T11:16:07,Twokinds,"Yeah back before I gave up soda entirely, I used to drink coke but couldn't stand diet coke."
26-12-2018T11:16:22,Twokinds,"I prefered diet pepsi to diet coke, despite being a coke drinker normally."
26-12-2018T11:16:42,RimaDraws,yea pepsi at least tastes better as a diet drink
26-12-2018T11:19:24,iliar,In my opinion drink just carbonated water more  tasty than Diet Cola/Pepsi.
26-12-2018T11:20:24,Twokinds,That's what I do now!
26-12-2018T11:20:35,TerraTheWizard,ew carbonated water
26-12-2018T11:20:41,RimaDraws,i would rather drink flavored water
26-12-2018T11:20:44,Twokinds,Way healthier.
26-12-2018T11:21:02,Twokinds,Sparkling water is good. I had it for the first time this year and I was susprised.
26-12-2018T11:21:31,iliar,And me too. I tried to drink just water. But it is not tasty.
26-12-2018T11:23:39,TerraTheWizard,the sugar tax over here meant a lot of soft drink companies have put out sugar free versions of their drinks
26-12-2018T11:24:39,TerraTheWizard,though some of them taste weird if they're cooled
26-12-2018T11:26:39,TerraTheWizard,just waiting for the day they find out sweetners cause health issues
26-12-2018T11:27:56,SpazztasticKiwi,You‚Äôd never tried sparkling water before?
26-12-2018T11:28:01,SpazztasticKiwi,How
26-12-2018T11:29:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"I like the clear peach, strawberry, and mandarin orange"
26-12-2018T11:56:55,Xexanoth,"i really don't get this ""flavored"" water stuff, if you wanna have the taste just go drink juice"
26-12-2018T11:57:19,Xexanoth,it just taste like way to watered down juice anyways
26-12-2018T11:58:25,Twokinds,Juice is bad for you
26-12-2018T11:59:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Sugar wise and for your teeth yeah

26-12-2018T12:00:17,Twokinds,Nooooon
26-12-2018T12:00:47,Xexanoth,depends on the juice
26-12-2018T12:01:29,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-katdryer:
26-12-2018T12:01:34,Xexanoth,but the cheap store bought one is probably not very healthy
26-12-2018T12:01:49,Xexanoth,because why have taste when you can just add more sugar to make it taste sweet
26-12-2018T12:03:11,Azumachan,Good Mornin/Noon
26-12-2018T12:03:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Excuse you it‚Äôs still 11

26-12-2018T12:05:01,SpazztasticKiwi,In which case I hate being picked up so it‚Äôs likely to be absent at any wedding I have
26-12-2018T12:05:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Though maybe not ‚Äúhate‚Äù. Definitely not a fan
26-12-2018T12:05:28,Azumachan,Roombas are a nice things.
26-12-2018T12:06:08,Xexanoth,"yes they are, unless you have pets, in that case bad stuff can happen"
26-12-2018T12:06:45,Azumachan,No pet.
26-12-2018T12:06:57,Azumachan,Well the roomba I guess.
26-12-2018T12:07:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I can see both of my cats heading for high ground around a roomba
26-12-2018T12:07:08,Azumachan,It's like an evolved pet rock
26-12-2018T12:07:44,Azumachan,I wonder how should I name my new one.
26-12-2018T12:11:28,Xexanoth,hmm look at the serial number and check if it looks vaguely like a name and go from there?
26-12-2018T12:12:04,Azumachan,No luck.
26-12-2018T12:12:51,Azumachan,"The last one was named ""Sir Googly"""
26-12-2018T12:13:51,Xexanoth,did you put googly eyes on him?
26-12-2018T12:14:01,Azumachan,Indeed.
26-12-2018T12:14:06,Xexanoth,nice

26-12-2018T12:20:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Not right off
26-12-2018T12:23:10,Xexanoth,"""Petscarer 3000""....""Petmobil"" would only really work if you ahd pets that ride it around"

26-12-2018T12:26:07,Xexanoth,but then you need to add a self destruct button
26-12-2018T12:26:43,Azumachan,No platypus zone sticker ?

26-12-2018T17:37:20,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs like
26-12-2018T17:37:23,SpazztasticKiwi,5 pm
26-12-2018T17:38:46,Bgrmystr2,that's like
26-12-2018T17:38:48,Bgrmystr2,irrelevant
26-12-2018T17:55:23,Dadrobit,\o/ Laptop arrived. Time to do a fresh Windows install. Get all that Dell bloat off of it.
26-12-2018T17:56:05,Dadrobit,That crap's eating up a good two gigs of ram at idle.
26-12-2018T18:27:07,SpazztasticKiwi,*chorus of hallelujah*
26-12-2018T18:27:24,SpazztasticKiwi,You know I‚Äôve been looking at Momocon cause I‚Äôm seriously considering it
26-12-2018T18:28:13,SpazztasticKiwi,They have a ‚Äúnight at the aquarium‚Äù thing where you can go exclusively with only other con goers after hours. And ‚Äúfull costume‚Äù is allowed
26-12-2018T18:28:25,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs gonna be some confused fish
26-12-2018T18:34:32,RimaDraws,hi
26-12-2018T18:37:52,Dadrobit,Howdy
26-12-2018T18:38:04,Dadrobit,Local aquarium has something similar.
26-12-2018T18:38:27,Dadrobit,After hours sessions for 18+ persons only.
26-12-2018T18:39:16,Dadrobit,"Sorry, 21+"
26-12-2018T18:39:53,RimaDraws,ooh
26-12-2018T18:40:00,RimaDraws,hi dadro
26-12-2018T18:43:01,Dadrobit,$25 for general admission. $40 for the VIP package with a dinner. Or $15 if you have a season pass.
26-12-2018T18:43:23,Dadrobit,$15 is for the VIP. It's otherwise free with the season pass.
26-12-2018T18:44:22,Dadrobit,I should probably go to that. I've only ever really gone to make recordings of crowds and animal vocalizations.
26-12-2018T18:48:05,SpazztasticKiwi,The only problem with going to momo is getting there. It‚Äôs close enough to drive and I‚Äôd hate to have to fly but I don‚Äôt have an available car
26-12-2018T18:48:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder if I could drag someone along with me. I know a few people who wouldn‚Äôt need much convincing
26-12-2018T18:49:44,SpazztasticKiwi,But they may not be able to get vacation off or have the money at the moment
26-12-2018T18:53:38,Dadrobit,Fresh install success! Down from 4.3 gigs of ram in use at idle to 2.3!
26-12-2018T18:53:57,Dadrobit,Bloatware is actually the worst.
26-12-2018T18:53:58,Bgrmystr2,jesus 4.3gb idle
26-12-2018T18:54:25,Dadrobit,"Dell support, Antimalware ""services"". Stuff like that."
26-12-2018T18:54:51,Dadrobit,Was spot on with the 2 gig estimate. Feelsgoodman
26-12-2018T18:55:03,Dadrobit,Now I just need to go through who knows how many updates.
26-12-2018T18:55:17,Bgrmystr2,"I barely use 2gb at idle, usually about 1gb or so"
26-12-2018T18:55:35,Bgrmystr2,1.5 ish for the most part cuz I keep a browser open to read the chat here :v
26-12-2018T18:55:40,Dadrobit,4.3 of 16 gigs available. Legit 25% usage for nothing beforehand.
26-12-2018T18:56:02,Dadrobit,32 bit system?
26-12-2018T18:56:04,Bgrmystr2,"I've only got 10gb total, so 4.3gb idle would kill me"
26-12-2018T18:56:07,Bgrmystr2,no? 64bit
26-12-2018T18:56:12,Bgrmystr2,win7
26-12-2018T18:56:14,Dadrobit,Win 10?
26-12-2018T18:56:20,Dadrobit,"Ah, yeah, that'll do it."
26-12-2018T18:56:28,Bgrmystr2,why would I use 10? it eats ram for breakfast lol
26-12-2018T18:56:43,Bgrmystr2,also incompatable with most programs I use day to day
26-12-2018T18:57:06,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-RainbowThrowup:
26-12-2018T18:57:08,Dadrobit,"10 64 bit is 2gigs idle. Not ideal. But alas, my win 7 machine was just having too many issues with Pro Tools."
26-12-2018T18:57:27,Bgrmystr2,I wish Win7 was as good as XP though..
26-12-2018T18:57:54,Bgrmystr2,200 MB ram idle highballing? good god damn that's nice.
26-12-2018T19:02:38,SpazztasticKiwi,That reminds me I bought sun nautical but forgot to take it out with me today to download it
26-12-2018T19:06:30,Dadrobit,"""sun nautical"" ?"
26-12-2018T19:07:03,CrRAR,"sounds way tubular, dude."
26-12-2018T19:08:02,CrRAR,"methinks an autocorrect from ""subnautica""."
26-12-2018T19:11:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm privy to a mermaid look if I go to momo
26-12-2018T20:40:10,RimaDraws,i finally finished crimson's christmas gift
