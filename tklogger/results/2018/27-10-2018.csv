27-10-2018T00:05:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-natanisleep: see ya guys in the stream
27-10-2018T00:16:24,Dadrobit,o/ Have a good one all y'all that're leavin'.
27-10-2018T00:16:38,Dadrobit,Just made a loaded baked potato w/ bacon. Good eatin'.
27-10-2018T00:17:18,CrRAR,:9
27-10-2018T00:17:38,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
27-10-2018T00:18:15,RimaDraws,oh that sounds good
27-10-2018T00:21:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t know what it is but I’ve been downright craving potatoes and cheese lately
27-10-2018T00:24:10,CrRAR,Good fall food. Possibly hibernation instinct. :thinking:
27-10-2018T00:25:20,CrRAR,"I've been hankering potatoes too lately, made homefries this morning."
27-10-2018T00:25:54,CrRAR,...and just recently more in general.
27-10-2018T00:28:00,CrRAR,"Boil 'em, mash 'em, stick 'em in a stew~"
27-10-2018T00:28:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I mainly want a bunch of mashed potatoes with cheese
27-10-2018T00:28:45,SpazztasticKiwi,And bacon
27-10-2018T00:29:07,SpazztasticKiwi,And steamed veggies
27-10-2018T00:29:11,SpazztasticKiwi,With more cheese
27-10-2018T00:46:13,Dadrobit,"I tell you what though. This game might have issues, but the cinematic camera for the auto pilot mode is friggin fantastic."
27-10-2018T01:16:11,unsteddyphoenix,Ooh I love the new image
27-10-2018T01:16:22,unsteddyphoenix,Totes down for random magpie art
27-10-2018T01:16:29,unsteddyphoenix,Also what game dad
27-10-2018T01:17:04,SpazztasticKiwi,RDR2
27-10-2018T01:17:22,unsteddyphoenix,Ohh yeah that's out
27-10-2018T01:17:26,unsteddyphoenix,It has issues?
27-10-2018T01:18:15,Dadrobit,It places more focus on immersive gameplay than it does on seamless gameplay.
27-10-2018T01:18:43,Dadrobit,"Which is ironic, as the constant little things they do to be ""immersive"" kind of take me out of the experience."
27-10-2018T01:19:30,unsteddyphoenix,"I would value immersiveness over seamless gameplay though, personally"
27-10-2018T01:19:38,unsteddyphoenix,...immsersivity?
27-10-2018T01:19:43,unsteddyphoenix,What takes you out?
27-10-2018T01:20:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"“Dadrobit, dinner!” , probably"
27-10-2018T01:21:28,Dadrobit,"One of the big bears that I mentioned earlier was that the main character puts away his weapons every time he gets on a horse, and in order to re-equip them you have to again go into the equipment menu and do it again."
27-10-2018T01:22:24,Dadrobit,"This gets real old real quick, especially when you jumped off your horse to defend yourself from bandits/bounty hunters and find yourself with only your pistol."
27-10-2018T01:23:14,Dadrobit,"So you have to meander on over to your horse to get your guns out again, but good luck with having your horse stay alive as it gets shot and suffers perma-death."
27-10-2018T01:23:38,unsteddyphoenix,"It isnt just like, one button press to get your weapons out?"
27-10-2018T01:24:34,Dadrobit,"Nope, you can only carry so many weapons at a time, (pistol, 2 long weapons, and a melee) and everything but your pistol gets put away when you ride a horse."
27-10-2018T01:25:09,Dadrobit,"Oh, and when you whistle for your horse, it comes to you in real time."
27-10-2018T01:25:31,Dadrobit,"So if you left it 500 meters away, pull out a nice book to read while it comes back."
27-10-2018T01:25:48,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao
27-10-2018T01:25:52,Dadrobit,"And if you get too far away from the horse, it doesn't come at all.\"
27-10-2018T01:26:04,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, I never had a problem with the assassins creed ""your house just spawns 30 feet away"" technique"
27-10-2018T01:26:12,unsteddyphoenix,horse*
27-10-2018T01:26:29,Dadrobit,It's especially pleasurable when it decides to just walk to you instead of at least trotting.
27-10-2018T01:26:51,Dadrobit,"Yeah, and Witcher 3 as well. It just teleports right behind you."
27-10-2018T01:27:11,Dadrobit,"Almost named my horse ""Roach"" but decided against it."
27-10-2018T01:27:22,Dadrobit,Horsey McHorse just seemed better.
27-10-2018T01:27:38,Dadrobit,"Alas, Horsey McHorseface was too long."
27-10-2018T01:27:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Teleporting house sounds cool
27-10-2018T01:27:53,unsteddyphoenix,"Shouldve been ""SIR Horsey McHorse"""
27-10-2018T01:28:08,unsteddyphoenix,That would also be very convinient
27-10-2018T01:28:24,Dadrobit,"Ah, and there's not really any fast travel either."
27-10-2018T01:28:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, Mark’s was trying to find the horse call button & I’m not sure he’s figured it out yet"
27-10-2018T01:29:10,Dadrobit,"Technically there is, but you need to spend a lot of money on upgrading your camp first, and you then can only teleport from your camp to a town you've already visited."
27-10-2018T01:29:20,Dadrobit,You can't go from town to town.
27-10-2018T01:29:45,Dadrobit,"You can auto-pilot on your horse, but that can be interrupted by random encounters."
27-10-2018T01:29:48,SpazztasticKiwi,No spontaneous teleportation for hoomans
27-10-2018T01:30:00,Dadrobit,"And you can take a coach or a train, but everything is in real time."
27-10-2018T01:31:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Hopefully Tom gets to get his time with the game. He said he was waiting for it
27-10-2018T01:32:23,unsteddyphoenix,That is some weird design choices
27-10-2018T01:32:43,unsteddyphoenix,It's pretty established that convinient things like fast travel doesnt break suspension of disbelief
27-10-2018T01:33:28,unsteddyphoenix,How big is the map?
27-10-2018T01:33:37,Dadrobit,Fuckin ' huge.
27-10-2018T01:37:32,unsteddyphoenix,Hmm
27-10-2018T01:37:42,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, overall how's the game though"
27-10-2018T01:39:49,Dadrobit,I'm enjoying it for the most part still.
27-10-2018T01:40:11,Dadrobit,It's just the little things that are just..... Eh.
27-10-2018T01:40:50,Dadrobit,"Like, I didn't play RDR1 and think to myself, ""You know what this needs? A hunger management system!"""
27-10-2018T01:41:39,Dadrobit,"""And who doesn't love having their health drop because the outfit I'm wearing is too hot/cold for my current environment!"""
27-10-2018T02:16:57,unsteddyphoenix,"...Interesting desicions, for sure"
27-10-2018T02:21:06,Dadrobit,"Ah, and I hope you like being a good Samaritan, because the honor system flat out locks you out of certain missions if your honor isn't high enough and just generally makes the game easier for the player by giving them discounts on everything."
27-10-2018T02:29:00,Dadrobit,"Oh, and the bounty system is dumb as bricks."
27-10-2018T02:29:53,Dadrobit,"Any time you have a bounty in state limits, you can and will be mercilessly hunted by a giant posse that are very good at killing. And when they kill you, it does nothing to take away from your bounty, they just steal your money."
27-10-2018T02:30:11,Dadrobit,The ONLY way to get rid of a bounty is to pay it off.
27-10-2018T02:30:39,Bgrmystr2,that's.. legit dumb
27-10-2018T02:30:41,Dadrobit,Which is problematic when you're constantly being killed and having your money stolen from you.
27-10-2018T02:30:48,Bgrmystr2,wouldn't they take the money from the bounty?
27-10-2018T02:31:10,Dadrobit,"Nope. They just kill you, maybe kill your horse, and take some of your money."
27-10-2018T02:31:11,Bgrmystr2,or is it one of those things where the game is self-aware that you have more money than the bounty is
27-10-2018T02:31:27,Bgrmystr2,cuz you wanna talk about breaking the illusion
27-10-2018T02:31:30,Bgrmystr2,that'll do it
27-10-2018T02:31:41,Dadrobit,I have a whopping $80 to my name and well over $600 in bounties.
27-10-2018T02:31:55,Bgrmystr2,and they still won't take the bounty
27-10-2018T02:31:55,Dadrobit,They've come after me with less than $10 in my pockets.
27-10-2018T02:32:17,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, that equally applies"
27-10-2018T02:32:58,Dadrobit,I literally cannot pay off my bounty.
27-10-2018T02:33:46,Dadrobit,And looting $0.38 from the bodies of the folks I take down is heckin' dumb.
27-10-2018T02:35:07,Dadrobit,"Like, it just feels so inconsequential towards getting myself free."
27-10-2018T12:00:00,Twokinds,Good afternoon!
27-10-2018T12:00:59,BadFoMo,Yo.

27-10-2018T12:09:30,TerraTheWizard,"kay, ended today here"
27-10-2018T12:09:45,TerraTheWizard,had to remember 4 hour difference instead of the usual 5
27-10-2018T12:18:05,Mippy,Guess I’ll be watching the recording later.
27-10-2018T12:38:10,Mippy,I want my old Sunday shift back :ctwokinds-sadtrace2:
27-10-2018T12:43:00,RimaDraws,hey all

27-10-2018T12:53:16,BadFoMo,@Mippy Have you tried submitting a... one of those things that let's you change your work days?
27-10-2018T12:53:40,RimaDraws,work schedule flexibility?
27-10-2018T12:53:55,BadFoMo,...Dang; they're gone.
27-10-2018T12:54:11,BadFoMo,@RimaDraws I think that's it.
27-10-2018T12:54:35,RimaDraws,yeap
27-10-2018T12:55:19,BadFoMo,I remember having to fill one of thoes out a few weeks ago.
27-10-2018T12:56:38,RimaDraws,mhm
27-10-2018T12:57:25,Mippy,I’ve never heard of one of those @BadFoMo
27-10-2018T12:59:25,Mippy,"Well, I’ll see everyone on break"
27-10-2018T13:01:23,Ordithus,see ya mip
27-10-2018T13:05:16,BadFoMo,"@Mippy Bye. Also, maybe ask one of the 'higher-ups' about such a thing?"
27-10-2018T13:28:11,Dadrobit,"Schedule swapping? Dunno about anyone else, but any job I've ever held has always put up a fight against even giving me guaranteed vacation time, much less actually changing up an entire schedule."
27-10-2018T13:29:34,Dadrobit,Back in security I had to straight up bribe other guards with money or booze to get them to cover for me for a day off because management always made us negotiate time off ourselves. Fuckin' sucked.
27-10-2018T13:30:50,Ordithus,Went for a walk to acquire burrito.  Spotted a Pileated Woodpecker along the way.
27-10-2018T13:30:58,Ordithus,Pretty bird

27-10-2018T13:45:08,CrRAR,good think in the afterlife we are not judged by the chicken gods of chicken heaven.
27-10-2018T13:45:36,Combak,That's what you think!
27-10-2018T13:45:43,CrRAR,"*though then we'd be sent to chicken hell, which is sure to have lost of roasted chickens."

27-10-2018T13:58:08,CrRAR,Are they a big gathering? Like a community thing?

27-10-2018T14:52:44,ThingsAreMoving,try switching it off and on again
27-10-2018T14:53:03,Bgrmystr2,our microwave beeps when it's done.. then continues to beep.. then beeps more.. then you finally get to the kitchen and open the door.. AND IT'S STILL YELLING AT YOU.. BEEEEEP
27-10-2018T14:53:09,Bgrmystr2,fucking microwave srsly
27-10-2018T14:53:16,Tharkis,"last time it got voted on it did well, so i resuggested it hehe"
27-10-2018T14:53:24,Ordithus,You need a new microwave.  Or at least get rid of that one.
27-10-2018T14:53:30,Bgrmystr2,it's brand new
27-10-2018T14:53:33,Bgrmystr2,it did that out of the box
27-10-2018T14:53:35,Ordithus,Mine... is only used as a clock and to reheat chinese.
27-10-2018T14:53:37,Ordithus,That's it
27-10-2018T14:53:42,CrRAR,"Just tear the magnetron out of it, plug it in on demand, and point it at the object you're interested in cooking!"
27-10-2018T14:53:44,CrRAR,Easy!
27-10-2018T14:53:45,Tharkis,"it's one of those suggestions that's 'time sensitive' because it relates to a previous picture, and the more the previous picture is out of mind of people the less votes i'll get hehe"
27-10-2018T14:53:49,Bgrmystr2,it's literally programmed to do so lol
27-10-2018T14:54:02,Ordithus,"Seems safe, CrRAR"

27-10-2018T16:40:06,ThingsAreMoving,Thriller Nibbs was absolutely glorious
27-10-2018T16:40:20,ProsePro7,Dang Nora tall

27-10-2018T16:40:57,BadFoMo,And Zombie Alaric.
27-10-2018T16:41:09,Dadrobit,95% of everything that I've gotten through to a sketch/color has all been Tom Picks.
27-10-2018T16:41:14,Ordithus,Same
27-10-2018T16:41:19,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Not to mention, Tom does have the same request in multiple rounds before."
27-10-2018T16:41:19,Glassan,Thriller nibs definitely makes it into my halloween wallpaper rotations.
27-10-2018T16:41:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Same dad
27-10-2018T16:41:22,FenceEqualizer,Same
27-10-2018T16:41:25,ThingsAreMoving,100% of my suggestions are Tom picks
27-10-2018T16:41:31,ThingsAreMoving,so far
27-10-2018T16:41:34,phil199,you seem to have a good taste then for Tom
27-10-2018T16:41:35,unsteddyphoenix,haha
27-10-2018T16:41:46,Glassan,A lot of mine were the same way. I think only one was actually voted in.
27-10-2018T16:41:48,FenceEqualizer,We are the the pitied
27-10-2018T16:41:49,Dadrobit,Vanilla strawberries w/ honey.
27-10-2018T16:41:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,only like 2 of my stuff has won the votes.  I am very proud of those two
27-10-2018T16:41:57,unsteddyphoenix,im like 50/50 i think
27-10-2018T16:42:02,Ordithus,"Dust is his weakness, so, robit hit im hard"
27-10-2018T16:42:06,Tharkis,i got real close on a few votes
27-10-2018T16:42:08,BadFoMo,I think most of mine need to be Tom Picks too.
27-10-2018T16:42:10,Dadrobit,I know my audience
27-10-2018T16:42:15,PalmettoPathfinder1,It's an even mix for me as well unsteddy.
27-10-2018T16:42:18,Tharkis,but the one i've had drawn was a pick =)
27-10-2018T16:42:18,ThingsAreMoving,Dad with the weak point attacks
27-10-2018T16:42:56,unsteddyphoenix,doing massive damage
27-10-2018T16:43:18,Tharkis,#doDamage !
27-10-2018T16:43:22,Dadrobit,I think the Valentine's Day one and one other were actual votes.
27-10-2018T16:44:22,FenceEqualizer,Then there was the Keith Madness one that had people frothing at the mouth cause Nantani was ded
27-10-2018T16:44:23,Dadrobit,I want to say the one that introduced the assassin kids w/ Adelaide AU was a legit vote somehow?
27-10-2018T16:44:34,Dadrobit,"Heheheheheh, yeah."
27-10-2018T16:44:43,ThingsAreMoving,"King: this is a nice party, but how about we make it a bit more exciting? Nora: what ever do you have in mind? King: let's toss some houses down the hill."
27-10-2018T16:44:47,Ordithus,It took a while for Tom to warm up to that one
27-10-2018T16:45:01,unsteddyphoenix,that tooka turn iwasnt expecting things
27-10-2018T16:45:07,Dadrobit,"Tom immediately liked that one, community backlash had it changed :/"
27-10-2018T16:45:25,ThingsAreMoving,"was it a good surprise, unfteddy?"
27-10-2018T16:45:27,unsteddyphoenix,Uhh I distinctly remembertom disliking that one  initially
27-10-2018T16:45:30,FenceEqualizer,"And then people loved it when it was drawn, didn't it get colored?"
27-10-2018T16:45:31,Ordithus,"No, I remember him thinking it was really sad.  Cuz dead Nat"
27-10-2018T16:45:44,unsteddyphoenix,"a pleasaent surprise, to be sure"
27-10-2018T16:45:50,PalmettoPathfinder1,Wait. What did Tom dislike?  I had to step away for a second.
27-10-2018T16:45:57,Dadrobit,"Nah, first week he distinctly said he liked it. Somewhere around the third is when he backtracked on it."
27-10-2018T16:46:01,ThingsAreMoving,"'Here lies Natani, he never scored' - that one?"
27-10-2018T16:46:08,Ordithus,Haha
27-10-2018T16:46:16,Dadrobit,"Yeah, that one."
27-10-2018T16:46:32,ThingsAreMoving,It was pretty amusing in the end
27-10-2018T16:46:33,Ordithus,"You may be right, robit"
27-10-2018T16:46:49,Ordithus,I've mis'membered before
27-10-2018T16:47:03,unsteddyphoenix,"im...unconvinced but, whatever"
27-10-2018T16:47:09,Dadrobit,"Yeah, cuz after that I had to change it up a bit."
27-10-2018T16:47:57,Combak,What was the exact suggestion there?
27-10-2018T16:48:02,FenceEqualizer,I want to say Tom liked it too but I have bad memory
27-10-2018T16:48:45,ThingsAreMoving,gonna grab some tea with honey. brb :ctwokinds-kingtea:
27-10-2018T16:48:49,Dadrobit,The first iteration was Keith and Maddie having a romantic dinner while in the background was an urn with Natani's necklace around it.
27-10-2018T16:49:03,RandomTonio,Nora and Adelaide will be shipped the moment this picture gets released
27-10-2018T16:49:13,Dadrobit,More or less. I believe it was on a fireplace mantle specifically.
27-10-2018T16:49:14,Combak,Oh yeah...
27-10-2018T16:49:19,unsteddyphoenix,i still like that iteration too

27-10-2018T16:58:23,Dadrobit,Literally 80% of the chatter in any given TK chat is about how their own personal chat is the supreme chat while all other are just run by child diddlying turbo-racists.

27-10-2018T21:47:26,Ordithus,"Also, someone needs to gift Pretorian with an Art Book.  Seems he's on a yearslong quest for Raine booty."
27-10-2018T21:47:28,Dadrobit,I actually had my first BL not too long ago. You actually can not taste anything.
27-10-2018T21:47:59,Dadrobit,It's legitimately astounding how un-beerlike it is.
27-10-2018T21:48:11,Ordithus,What you can taste is just.... blegh
27-10-2018T21:48:20,Ordithus,"I'd rather have just water, thank you."
27-10-2018T21:48:26,Dadrobit,There's just a hint of hops on the nose. That's it.
27-10-2018T21:49:02,Dadrobit,Like it was just cans of water that happened to be transported to the store on a truck that was actually carrying other beers.
27-10-2018T21:49:56,unsteddyphoenix,What's the %?
27-10-2018T21:50:34,Dadrobit,4.2
27-10-2018T21:50:47,unsteddyphoenix,Ech
27-10-2018T21:50:54,unsteddyphoenix,What a waste of time lol
27-10-2018T21:51:09,Ordithus,I've had beer with similar ABV that actually tastes good
27-10-2018T21:51:38,Dadrobit,"See, that's why I drink bourbon. Literally 10x the content, so I can just make myself one glass and enjoy the night on that."
27-10-2018T21:52:16,Dadrobit,To be fair (kind of) I think the average beer in America is only around 5-6%.
27-10-2018T21:53:28,Ordithus,:cake:+:wine_glass:=:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
27-10-2018T21:54:03,unsteddyphoenix,^
27-10-2018T21:54:09,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah im not a beer drinking anyway
27-10-2018T21:54:15,unsteddyphoenix,drinker*
27-10-2018T21:54:33,unsteddyphoenix,"Im a culture-traitor, but so be it~"
27-10-2018T21:54:53,Dadrobit,"While I do enjoy myself some good cheeses, rare is the wine that I find palatable."
27-10-2018T21:55:42,Dadrobit,"Dunno, I don't drink much at all (one glass every month or two) but somehow I just gravitated to the harder stuff."
27-10-2018T21:56:01,Dadrobit,Whole family thinks I'm weird for drinking what I do.
27-10-2018T21:56:19,Ordithus,Bourbon is good though
27-10-2018T21:56:26,Dadrobit,(They're not drinkers either. 'Cept grandma.)
27-10-2018T21:56:48,Dadrobit,Cheers! :tumbler_glass:
27-10-2018T21:57:22,unsteddyphoenix,i cant drink whisky anymore after I threw up one time
27-10-2018T21:57:31,Ordithus,Cheers!  I'm just drinking water though
27-10-2018T21:57:37,Dadrobit,Same
27-10-2018T21:57:51,Dadrobit,What were you drinking by chance?
27-10-2018T21:57:56,Dadrobit,Just curious.
27-10-2018T21:58:12,unsteddyphoenix,"Jack daniels, I think"
27-10-2018T21:58:40,Ordithus,Jack is pretty decent stuff.  Either too much or something didn't agree with oyou.
27-10-2018T21:59:06,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah it was probably the former. I have a fairly weak stomach.
27-10-2018T21:59:29,Dadrobit,"I have a bottle of Jack in the cupboards as well. Prefer Maker's 46, but JD gets the job done."
27-10-2018T21:59:46,Twokinds,I agree with you there
27-10-2018T21:59:50,Twokinds,Can't drink
27-10-2018T21:59:54,Ordithus,I've got Vikre Hay & Sunshine in mine
27-10-2018T22:00:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I choose not to drink
27-10-2018T22:01:42,Dadrobit,"""blend of bourbon, rye, and Scotch, carefully curated and finished in Cognac casks"" whew lad, what have you got going on there?!?"
27-10-2018T22:02:03,Ordithus,"Tastiness, that's what"
27-10-2018T22:02:05,Dadrobit,Better part of a pre-made cocktail
27-10-2018T22:02:08,Ordithus,haha
27-10-2018T22:03:16,Ordithus,"I don't drink much, really.  Rarely even 2 drinks worth.  Was drunk once, way back in 06.  Never again."
27-10-2018T22:03:47,Dadrobit,"Yeah, can't say I've ever actually gotten drunk."
27-10-2018T22:04:01,Dadrobit,Had the same bottles in the cabinets for some time now.
27-10-2018T22:04:44,AFallingTree,Damn battery died
27-10-2018T22:05:09,Ordithus,RIP battery :trumpet:
27-10-2018T22:05:17,AFallingTree,Did I miss much?
27-10-2018T22:05:40,Bgrmystr2,only the whole stream
27-10-2018T22:05:43,Ordithus,Did you see any of the stream?
27-10-2018T22:05:48,AFallingTree,Yeah
27-10-2018T22:05:57,AFallingTree,Up to Kat massage
27-10-2018T22:06:06,Bgrmystr2,I didn't see ya there at all.. did you even talk
27-10-2018T22:06:28,AFallingTree,"Na not much, it’s kinda hard to multitask"
27-10-2018T22:06:33,Ordithus,After that was Professor Rosegall and then the big ol mindswap
27-10-2018T22:06:44,AFallingTree,If only streams weren’t on a Monday...
27-10-2018T22:06:52,Bgrmystr2,they're not though :P
27-10-2018T22:06:58,Bgrmystr2,they're sunday afternoon

27-10-2018T22:07:11,Bgrmystr2,and that fixes the problem
27-10-2018T22:07:20,Ordithus,How does a small bird type on a phone
27-10-2018T22:07:31,Bgrmystr2,with precision
27-10-2018T22:07:32,unsteddyphoenix,Just plan your life around them like me! :D
27-10-2018T22:07:36,AFallingTree,Beak XD
27-10-2018T22:07:37,unsteddyphoenix,"Totally normal thing to do, after all."
27-10-2018T22:07:38,Bgrmystr2,yeah just be phoenix
27-10-2018T22:07:42,Bgrmystr2,easy

27-10-2018T22:08:13,AFallingTree,But a job means money
27-10-2018T22:08:50,AFallingTree,Isn’t Phoenix kiwi as well?

27-10-2018T22:09:24,Bgrmystr2,lens* sjklafgbaj
27-10-2018T22:09:39,Dadrobit,"Dang, trying to find some of that Honor Brand, but they don't sell it in stores West of Texas."
27-10-2018T22:10:15,AFallingTree,I’m just gonna live in America just to watch the Sunday streams
27-10-2018T22:10:18,Ordithus,I'm surprised it gets that far
27-10-2018T22:11:18,unsteddyphoenix,sounds like a good plan
27-10-2018T22:11:32,AFallingTree,Welp you guys have a good day or night or whatever it is where you are
27-10-2018T22:11:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I return
27-10-2018T22:11:56,Ordithus,"Night Tree, wb Kiwi"
27-10-2018T22:12:02,Ordithus,Who is not a Kiwi
27-10-2018T22:12:02,SpazztasticKiwi,And I bring soup leftovers
27-10-2018T22:12:15,Dadrobit,"Looks like I'm SOL. Half of their online dealer links are duds, and the ones that aren't either don't ship the whiskey, or don't ship it to AZ."
27-10-2018T22:12:24,Dadrobit,o/ Tree
27-10-2018T22:13:29,Ordithus,"Wow, Vikre distributes way farther than I expected, though."
27-10-2018T22:13:47,Dadrobit,"And yeah, most of the brick and mortar retail is just focused in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania."
27-10-2018T22:14:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Dadro this may be off topic but would you say the effects of edibles and smoking the “cursed devil lettuce” have the same effects
27-10-2018T22:14:34,Ordithus,They only opened in 2012
27-10-2018T22:15:46,Dadrobit,"Ohhhh, wow, cool to see them get as big as they are in so few years."
27-10-2018T22:16:13,Dadrobit,"No, smoking and eating edibles do not affect me in the same way."
27-10-2018T22:16:16,Ordithus,Seems booze is becoming my town's biggest export
27-10-2018T22:17:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"Cause the guy that recently got let go had “allergies” to explain his constantly red and itchy, watery eyes"
27-10-2018T22:18:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"And when I say red, I mean they were 🛑 🛑"
27-10-2018T22:19:22,SpazztasticKiwi,My point is that I wonder if he smoked so much that his eyes were so sensitive that he developed pink eye from the rubbing
27-10-2018T22:21:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"In which case, I found Canada running short on resources so quickly after legalization a lil funny"
27-10-2018T22:24:10,Dadrobit,"Sorry, took a call. But yeah, edibles will give you red eyes as well."
27-10-2018T22:24:30,Dadrobit,Never had them get particularly itchy though.
27-10-2018T22:25:51,Dadrobit,Dude could've just had real bad allergies honestly. I know that when I have bad breakouts I'll go through a full box of kleenex in a day easy.
27-10-2018T22:26:43,Ordithus,Your poor nose
27-10-2018T22:27:04,Dadrobit,It's actually the worst.
27-10-2018T22:27:31,Dadrobit,Have to get the extra soft kleenex or I'll rub my nose bloody.
27-10-2018T22:28:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Aw Dadro gotta get the softie tissues
27-10-2018T22:29:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"I obviously think he was high at work, especially since he acted so spacey, but he was also young so idk"
27-10-2018T22:29:13,Dadrobit,Sucks man. Legit didn't hand out the dough for the good stuff one time and actually just rubbed off the top layers of my skin on the tip of my nose. Just made everything worse.
27-10-2018T22:29:28,Ordithus,ow ow ow
27-10-2018T22:29:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Do you use a soothing lotion for that skin in the winter/during allergy times?
27-10-2018T22:30:01,Dadrobit,S'what I get for being allergic to every grass and weed in Arizona.
27-10-2018T22:31:13,Dadrobit,"Nah, I just tough it out when it happens."
27-10-2018T22:31:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"A lil dab of vaseline or chapstick or blistex can help soothe, moisturize, and help heal/protect during sneezey times"
27-10-2018T22:31:59,Dadrobit,It's not a consistent enough problem for me to be able to do preventative maintenance on.
27-10-2018T22:32:45,Dadrobit,"And so long as don't get any more tissues made out of A1 printer paper, I'm usually fine."
27-10-2018T22:33:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"Whether it’s consistent a problem or not if it gets bad enough when it does happen that you’re rubbing layers of skin off, you may want a tiny bit of something"
27-10-2018T22:35:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I know I use chapstick enough to keep the splits away
27-10-2018T22:39:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"In other news, today’s dinner now has me on the mindset to get pimento cheese tomorrow"
27-10-2018T22:40:25,Twokinds,cheeese
27-10-2018T22:40:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I know

27-10-2018T22:41:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Pretty sure I wouldn’t survive lactose intolerance
27-10-2018T22:43:37,Ordithus,I manage
27-10-2018T22:43:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Have you got a chance to play any RDR2 by the way Tom?
27-10-2018T22:43:56,Ordithus,And I grew up in Wisconsin
27-10-2018T22:44:03,Twokinds,Nope. I don't have a console.
27-10-2018T22:44:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Poor thing
27-10-2018T22:44:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Do nite that wasn’t sarcasm
27-10-2018T22:44:29,SpazztasticKiwi,NOTE
27-10-2018T22:44:32,Twokinds,"And I've been really busy getting stuff done. If I get the chance, I'll play next month."
27-10-2018T22:44:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"sure when it’s it all caps, autocorrect doesn’t interfere"
27-10-2018T22:45:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, Ord you brave soul"
27-10-2018T22:45:29,Ordithus,I'm in exile :ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:
27-10-2018T22:45:36,Dadrobit,"If/When you do, be careful that you don't get yourself too high a bounty too early into the game. Absolutely hurts the experience."
27-10-2018T22:45:44,unsteddyphoenix,Ord i'll pray for you
27-10-2018T22:46:12,SpazztasticKiwi,If you don’t have a console how do you expect to play it next month? Buy a console and the game?
27-10-2018T22:46:26,Ordithus,Thanks stedd
27-10-2018T22:46:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"Ord, move states. You won’t be in exile"
27-10-2018T22:47:02,Ordithus,Um.
27-10-2018T22:47:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Sarcasm
27-10-2018T22:47:27,Ordithus,"I don't live in WI, so I did move?"
27-10-2018T22:48:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Freedom
27-10-2018T22:51:38,SonOfGoku,I still live in Wisconsin
27-10-2018T22:53:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Is it true the state welcome sign is made of cheese
27-10-2018T22:53:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"Cause if it’s not, that’s false advertising"
27-10-2018T22:54:18,Ordithus,Cheese so old it looks like wood.
27-10-2018T22:54:30,Dadrobit,Petrified cheese
27-10-2018T22:57:14,SonOfGoku,"Reminds me of a quote that a friend said ""contrary to popular belief, it does not snow cheese in WI"""
27-10-2018T22:58:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Snowing cheese
27-10-2018T22:58:18,SpazztasticKiwi,That’d gum up the roads for sure
27-10-2018T22:58:39,SonOfGoku,wait until it warms up
27-10-2018T22:58:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Mmmmmmmm gooey
27-10-2018T22:58:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Not to mention the smell
27-10-2018T22:59:04,SonOfGoku,what about the smell
27-10-2018T22:59:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Cheese
27-10-2018T22:59:17,SpazztasticKiwi,In the sun
27-10-2018T22:59:20,SpazztasticKiwi,For days
27-10-2018T22:59:24,SpazztasticKiwi,On asphalt
27-10-2018T23:01:22,Ordithus,Would cheese work like road salt :ptv-wondering:
27-10-2018T23:01:47,SonOfGoku,I would feel bad for anyone who is lactose intolerant
27-10-2018T23:02:00,Ordithus,Don't eat the road cheese
27-10-2018T23:02:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Well it would probably help like salt for providing traction
27-10-2018T23:02:05,Ordithus,No problem
27-10-2018T23:02:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Brings new meaning to “dont eat the yellow snow”
27-10-2018T23:03:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Provided snow cheese was shredded cheddar like and not parmesan or shredded swiss
27-10-2018T23:04:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Boy stereotypes are fun aren’t they
27-10-2018T23:05:06,CrRAR,It ain't easy bein' cheesy~
