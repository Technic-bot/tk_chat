27-02-2018T00:39:19,TheBeckoner,No problem.
27-02-2018T00:39:38,TheBeckoner,lol that was nearly an hour ago...now im slow
27-02-2018T01:05:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Just settled everything I think
27-02-2018T01:06:00,TheBeckoner,For your trip?
27-02-2018T01:06:23,TheBeckoner,feets are too cold
27-02-2018T01:07:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Believe so
27-02-2018T01:07:53,TheBeckoner,"Well that's good. you may have said before, but my memory sucks. Aren't you going to a con or something?"
27-02-2018T01:08:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"We‚Äôre leaving really early for traffic, pit stops, and the fact we‚Äôre VIP (I figure that means we‚Äôre getting in early)"
27-02-2018T01:08:45,SpazztasticKiwi,This is Jacksepticeye‚Äôs How Did We Get Here tour
27-02-2018T01:09:51,SpazztasticKiwi,We ended up showing up late for Mark‚Äôs Atlanta show so I‚Äôm not taking chances with this show
27-02-2018T01:10:08,TheBeckoner,Sounds like fun. I've never been to anything like that. I figured If I were to make a trip it would be wherever Tom set up lol.
27-02-2018T01:10:40,TheBeckoner,Mark had a show in Arizona I believe? Not super far away. Didnt get tickets tho.
27-02-2018T01:10:45,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs pretty cool to see the people you‚Äôve seen only on a screen in real life.
27-02-2018T01:11:05,SpazztasticKiwi,He‚Äôs just paler in person. Doesn‚Äôt glitter or anything
27-02-2018T01:11:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"I actually had people, after I came home ask me one major question, though..."
27-02-2018T01:12:04,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs he look like?‚Äù Uhhh..the same as his videos?
27-02-2018T01:14:58,TheBeckoner,Lol Marks been hidin behind those snapchat filters.
27-02-2018T01:15:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"Went by my friend‚Äôs house, the one with the sick little sister, and my god I‚Äôve never seen someone so excited to ask me questions"
27-02-2018T01:16:10,TheBeckoner,"I've meet a couple semi famous internet peoples irl, they were car people though. And it is neat to see that they aren't just figments of your imagination."
27-02-2018T01:16:32,TheBeckoner,Im assuming that was after Marks show?
27-02-2018T01:17:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"Yeah. I‚Äôd have taken her with me, but her guardians don‚Äôt want her leaving their sight too much"
27-02-2018T01:17:38,SpazztasticKiwi,And Mark‚Äôs opening act is...interesting to say the least
27-02-2018T01:19:34,TheBeckoner,Huh never seen it. What does he do?
27-02-2018T01:19:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"Strip, essentially"
27-02-2018T01:20:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôve never been so speechless in my life. I thought I got Markiplier tour tickets, not tickets to Magic Mike: Live"
27-02-2018T01:23:58,TheBeckoner,Oml that sounds...interesting.
27-02-2018T01:24:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚ÄúOk there goes the shirt....and the pants too?.....if he takes off those shorts, I‚Äôm leaving‚Äù"
27-02-2018T01:24:11,TheBeckoner,I mean he bathed in mash potatoes too soooo
27-02-2018T01:24:46,TheBeckoner,"Maybe when Tom has a table or whatever comic people do, he can strip for us too..."
27-02-2018T01:24:55,TheBeckoner,jastsayin
27-02-2018T01:25:00,TheBeckoner,just*
27-02-2018T01:25:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Thanks for that mental picture. Makes it even better (worse) that he‚Äôs online and seeing this üòë
27-02-2018T01:26:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"But I don‚Äôt put a lot past Mark. It‚Äôs what keeps it interesting. And if it makes him happy, I say go for it"
27-02-2018T01:27:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I guess I did find out why the show was like 18+ only
27-02-2018T01:28:18,TheBeckoner,(better) and yeah that sounds like it could throw off some residual embarrassment lol.
27-02-2018T01:28:45,TheBeckoner,Maybe some day I'll go see everyone I've been watching for years...
27-02-2018T01:28:51,TheBeckoner,huh that seems creepy
27-02-2018T01:29:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"I mean, he‚Äôs attractive, yes, but Jesus. Contain yourself"
27-02-2018T01:29:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"Not my type though, either, and I‚Äôll say that right to him - I‚Äôm sure he wouldn‚Äôt care"
27-02-2018T01:35:44,TheBeckoner,Probably not.
27-02-2018T01:36:11,TheBeckoner,"I just watched a little of a show he did in Houston,pretty interesting start lol. Not too bad imo"
27-02-2018T01:36:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I have my own pictures. Imma see if I can send them
27-02-2018T01:42:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Evidently not. But it‚Äôs on my Twitter. He liked them; I didn‚Äôt even expect him to see my tweet o
27-02-2018T01:43:51,TheBeckoner,Aw that's cool. I assume you tagged him or something? idk how twitter works tbh
27-02-2018T01:44:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"Yeah, but keep in mind he has a few thousand others tagging him at any other given time too"
27-02-2018T01:44:54,TheBeckoner,Right. You mustve had good timing.
27-02-2018T01:45:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"Now if I meet him and he recognizes my handle/username, then I‚Äôll be surprised"
27-02-2018T01:45:33,TheBeckoner,What's your username?
27-02-2018T01:45:46,SpazztasticKiwi,SpazztasticKiwi
27-02-2018T01:46:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"It‚Äôs the same on all my media, really. Easier to find and manage"
27-02-2018T01:50:28,TheBeckoner,Found it. Cute cactus lol
27-02-2018T01:51:03,TheBeckoner,And yeah I watched that act on youtube just a second ago. definitely not lacking interest.
27-02-2018T02:00:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark‚Äôs act?
27-02-2018T02:01:40,TheBeckoner,Yeah
27-02-2018T02:03:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"Oh I see snippets and it brings back memories. I was hoping to meet him at PAX, but it looks like he‚Äôs thinking about staying home"
27-02-2018T02:04:03,TheBeckoner,Tell him he's a loser and he should go anyway.
27-02-2018T02:04:09,TheBeckoner,it'll work
27-02-2018T02:08:36,TheBeckoner,It's gettin late and Im sorta cold. Im gonna head to bed. Goodnight.
27-02-2018T02:10:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôm not 100% believing he‚Äôll sit this one out just yet -  to stay home, I say duck tape him to the bed"
27-02-2018T02:11:38,SpazztasticKiwi,(before the dash): he‚Äôs done things despite being sick before. But if he‚Äôs feeling bad enough
27-02-2018T02:12:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Nite. I‚Äôll probably be off in a few hours
27-02-2018T02:24:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"So how interesting was that conversation, eh? Anyone got another one to start?"
27-02-2018T02:49:19,SpazztasticKiwi,G nite guys - I‚Äôm off
27-02-2018T13:50:23,TheBeckoner,Good afternoon my dudes

27-02-2018T19:01:11,Bgrmystr2,there usually aren't any moderators
27-02-2018T19:01:25,Bgrmystr2,"the chat regulates itself, basically"

27-02-2018T19:40:21,Bgrmystr2,heya Tom :)
27-02-2018T19:43:34,UnknownEnd,Ugh
27-02-2018T19:45:15,PalmettoPathfinder1,Hi y'all.  I have something to say:  if I've been....very temperamental and argumentative in the past.  I'm sorry.  Sighs.  Turns out my medication has...changed me to the point that my life has gone downhill
27-02-2018T19:46:18,PalmettoPathfinder1,I apologize for anything I've said or the actions that I've done to y'all.  I'm very sorry.
27-02-2018T19:47:38,MidnightBlue78,Tommy is doing tutorials!? üòÆ
27-02-2018T19:48:46,PalmettoPathfinder1,I'm going to see my doctor and talk to him about the medicine and what he thinks we need to do.
27-02-2018T19:49:37,MidnightBlue78,"yeah, i know the feeling Palm. That happens to me when i dont take my antidepressant for a few days because i just dont feel like it"
27-02-2018T19:49:52,MidnightBlue78,i turn into a huge bitch
27-02-2018T19:50:07,MidnightBlue78,I'm  not saying that's your case tho
27-02-2018T19:50:54,Chippotatothefirst,"Hey Tom, when you first started did you even have the slightest idea that you were going to make it this far?"
27-02-2018T19:51:26,Bgrmystr2,"I don't think I'll understand the idea of taking medication to change yourself. Was done to me when I was a kid, turned me into a fucking zombie"
27-02-2018T19:51:29,Bgrmystr2,never again
27-02-2018T19:52:06,Bgrmystr2,"it didn't change me, it was just a crutch"
27-02-2018T19:52:10,Bgrmystr2,and it didn't help
27-02-2018T19:52:10,PalmettoPathfinder1,Nods.  Yeah it's about the same but in reverse.  I have to constantly fight to control my temper.   It was like trying to keep myself from becoming Mr Hyde.  The medication is for controlling my ADHD
27-02-2018T19:52:43,Bgrmystr2,"I think you're capable of controlling it yourself without medication. The more you take medication, the more you rely on it"
27-02-2018T19:52:46,Bgrmystr2,it becomes a crutch
27-02-2018T19:52:51,Bgrmystr2,and you won't function with out
27-02-2018T19:52:54,Chippotatothefirst,"Yeah, one of the people on my wrestling team is literally brain dead from antidepressants and supressants"
27-02-2018T19:52:55,MidnightBlue78,my son takes meds for ADHD and he has really bad mood swings
27-02-2018T19:55:35,PalmettoPathfinder1,Unfortunately I need to take something for my ADHD.  It's moderate to severe ADHD.  I use to take another medication but the insurance company said they weren't going to cover it.
27-02-2018T19:56:52,PalmettoPathfinder1,I can function without my medicine except it's hard to focus and think at times.  The medication that the insurance company stopped covering was for calming me down so I could focus bettet
27-02-2018T19:56:58,PalmettoPathfinder1,*better

27-02-2018T20:00:43,PalmettoPathfinder1,i lost my temper one night over something insignificant and kicked a dent into a metal door.  The kick should have broken my toe.  It didn't.  That's the medication affecting me.   It's like speed.  :)
27-02-2018T20:00:50,PalmettoPathfinder1,Oops. I mean :(

27-02-2018T20:03:19,PalmettoPathfinder1,Hi y'all.  I was just apologizing for any times I've been temperamental and argumentative.  My medication has been affecting my personality lately so I wanted to apologize to everyone.
27-02-2018T20:03:33,Bgrmystr2,but.. you already did
27-02-2018T20:03:55,MidnightBlue78,Apology accepted
27-02-2018T20:04:16,MidnightBlue78,Although i have no frickin clue about what happened
27-02-2018T20:04:34,Bgrmystr2,I think most people are like that
27-02-2018T20:04:35,Chippotatothefirst,Me neither but I just go with it
27-02-2018T20:04:36,MidnightBlue78,You are forgiven
27-02-2018T20:04:43,Bgrmystr2,IE there's not really a point
27-02-2018T20:04:57,ZephyrTWolffox,"When life gives me lemons, I build a sandcastle!"
27-02-2018T20:05:03,PalmettoPathfinder1,Yeah I did.  But I wanted to apologize again.  I feel bad about it.  And thank you.  My family is helping me with this.  They've been concerned as they noticed that I seemed to be a different person.
27-02-2018T20:05:06,ZephyrTWolffox,:D

27-02-2018T20:06:01,PalmettoPathfinder1,Like I said the medicine I'm on is like speed.  Turns out people take it to make illegal steroids.  :(
27-02-2018T20:07:22,PalmettoPathfinder1,Hopefully my doctor can help me find another medication for my ADHD.
27-02-2018T20:08:31,PalmettoPathfinder1,I can't stand having to keep fighting against turning into Mr Hyde.
27-02-2018T20:11:47,PalmettoPathfinder1,But thank y'all for accepting my apology.
27-02-2018T20:12:00,PalmettoPathfinder1,Now I'm changing the subject to something better.
27-02-2018T20:12:13,PalmettoPathfinder1,To get my mind off this.
27-02-2018T20:12:50,PalmettoPathfinder1,So what's all this I hear about Tom doing tutorials?

27-02-2018T20:16:09,PalmettoPathfinder1,Tutorials = TKtorials.  I was about to make the connection.  But good job on the connection
27-02-2018T20:16:27,MidnightBlue78,i think his name blends in
27-02-2018T20:16:29,Bgrmystr2,"in fact, you and him were both here when it happened"
27-02-2018T20:16:39,Bgrmystr2,"how did you not notice, your messages are right next to his XD"
27-02-2018T20:16:40,MidnightBlue78,:ptv-ice:
27-02-2018T20:16:49,MidnightBlue78,really?
27-02-2018T20:16:56,Bgrmystr2,yeah
27-02-2018T20:17:07,MidnightBlue78,jeez
27-02-2018T20:17:23,PalmettoPathfinder1,And I had my root canal today.  In two weeks I get the crown core buildup done.
27-02-2018T20:17:32,MidnightBlue78,i need some glasses or something
27-02-2018T20:17:41,PalmettoPathfinder1,Or contacts.
27-02-2018T20:17:54,Bgrmystr2,ew contacts
27-02-2018T20:17:59,PalmettoPathfinder1,What?
27-02-2018T20:18:04,Bgrmystr2,glasses &gt; poking your eye
27-02-2018T20:18:18,PalmettoPathfinder1,Yeah but contacts don't break.
27-02-2018T20:18:30,Bgrmystr2,neither do glasses
27-02-2018T20:18:34,MidnightBlue78,I meant glasses of wine
27-02-2018T20:18:40,Bgrmystr2,"also, contacts need to be replaced eventually"
27-02-2018T20:18:46,Bgrmystr2,glasses technically do not
27-02-2018T20:18:51,MidnightBlue78,I may need alcohol
27-02-2018T20:19:35,Bgrmystr2,"contacts dry out, they're only rated for a certain length of time. Some are a week, some are 6 months, but"
27-02-2018T20:19:50,Bgrmystr2,glasses you can wear the same pair for a decade and never see any change.
27-02-2018T20:20:12,Bgrmystr2,External eye vision is superior. :}
27-02-2018T20:20:53,Chippotatothefirst,I‚Äôm blind in one eye but I get used to it if you don‚Äôt wear glasses then it‚Äôs always there and you‚Äôre used to it
27-02-2018T20:20:57,PalmettoPathfinder1,It's two weeks. I wear contacts at times but I also wear glasses if I'm off work or don't feel like wearing contacts.
27-02-2018T20:21:12,PalmettoPathfinder1,Also I'm near sighted.
27-02-2018T20:21:34,Bgrmystr2,"yours might be two weeks, palm"
27-02-2018T20:21:37,Bgrmystr2,but that's not all of them xD
27-02-2018T20:22:12,Bgrmystr2,my mother switched her contacts from a perscription that replaced them each week to a perscription that replaced them after 6 months
27-02-2018T20:22:30,Bgrmystr2,"that was several years ago though, so there's prolly better ones now"
27-02-2018T20:23:05,PalmettoPathfinder1,There are but my insurance company won't cover the 6 month ones.
27-02-2018T20:44:25,PalmettoPathfinder1,I wonder: what do Keidran priestesses and priests look like?
27-02-2018T20:45:22,PalmettoPathfinder1,Oh!  New 911 and Designated Survivor are coming on tonight!
27-02-2018T20:45:33,PalmettoPathfinder1,Episodes

27-02-2018T20:47:03,ZephyrTWolffox,I just don't like TV these days
27-02-2018T20:47:28,PalmettoPathfinder1,Why is that Zephyr?
27-02-2018T20:47:36,Chippotatothefirst,It‚Äôs like the same thing playing over and over
27-02-2018T20:47:44,ZephyrTWolffox,dunno.  it just bugs me.
27-02-2018T20:48:00,ZephyrTWolffox,Even the news
27-02-2018T20:48:09,PalmettoPathfinder1,I see.  Well that's understandable
27-02-2018T20:49:24,Chippotatothefirst,The only thing I hate more than the tv shows is their physics
27-02-2018T20:51:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Ello o/

27-02-2018T20:56:50,Chippotatothefirst,Some of the guns that have bullets bounce can go through two armor plates
27-02-2018T20:59:09,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Good evening, everyone!"

27-02-2018T21:01:55,PalmettoPathfinder1,Apparently cops and emergency personnel hate nights when the moon is full.
27-02-2018T21:02:01,ItsActuallyKopyKat,I almost missed it because I'm currently playing Skyrim
27-02-2018T21:02:11,DevlNuK,oh nice

27-02-2018T22:03:09,Gm35,will a marble staircase support a dragon's weight?
27-02-2018T22:03:14,Whitestripes,Dragon sized everything

27-02-2018T22:03:21,ZephyrTWolffox,I ate the other towers
27-02-2018T22:03:28,Dimensional,Spoiler alert: There's a dungeon with a dragon in it. And it's not the bad kind of dungeon either. ;3
27-02-2018T22:03:33,unsteddyphoenix,The mansion has so many spires im just realising
27-02-2018T22:03:35,Twokinds,Dragon-accessability is a fad among nobility

27-02-2018T22:03:54,TheFDdriver,oke
27-02-2018T22:03:58,unsteddyphoenix,Dont call it a fad it's very progressive
27-02-2018T22:04:02,Ordithus,It literally says it in the comic
27-02-2018T22:04:04,Twokinds,"Many minor nobles have houses that are sometimes 50% foyer, just to give the appearance that they could accomodate a dragon."
27-02-2018T22:04:16,Twokinds,Despite the fact that it takes up so much of their house and they've never had a dragon guest.
27-02-2018T22:04:18,ItsActuallyKopyKat,What a nice bit of lore
27-02-2018T22:04:18,Bgrmystr2,"""seven"" cracks me up every time. :ptv-laugh:"
27-02-2018T22:04:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,its the thought that counts
27-02-2018T22:04:50,unsteddyphoenix,"I love that, actually. I can totally picture the nobles bragging about their dragon-bathrooms to each other."
27-02-2018T22:04:57,Bgrmystr2,haha
27-02-2018T22:04:57,Ordithus,lol
27-02-2018T22:05:01,Gm35,"To be fair, if I could have a house with a small chance of a dragon coming to visit, I think I would."

27-02-2018T22:05:56,Dimensional,...someone ask what the score is.
27-02-2018T22:06:42,McClaw,There's also the idea that you didn't build lots of rooms -- you built fewer large ones and managed privacy differently.
27-02-2018T22:07:31,McClaw,"Remember that unless you magiced up something, you didn't have modern heating."
27-02-2018T22:07:34,Gm35,"trace is supposedly a master of magic. Why not build a regular home, then size-magic to scale it up?"
27-02-2018T22:07:42,ProsePro7,I'm interested to see how Tom is going to manage so many characters at once

27-02-2018T22:08:00,Dimensional,Hmm... So basically turn the Manson into a non-traveling tardis?
27-02-2018T22:08:13,Dimensional,Or make it so everybody who enters all become the same size?
27-02-2018T22:08:17,ProsePro7,Who said it cant travel
27-02-2018T22:08:26,unsteddyphoenix,Depends if magic in TK can defy physics and create matter from nothing
27-02-2018T22:08:28,Ordithus,A large mansion is so much more imposing.  Gotta keep up appearances when you're a tyrant.
27-02-2018T22:08:29,Gm35,"Howl's moving castle, anyone"
27-02-2018T22:08:34,McClaw,"Well, we've heard that Rose isn't able to leave."

27-02-2018T22:11:54,Dimensional,"You're like Trace, tom?"
27-02-2018T22:11:58,ProsePro7,Quick question is Rose the steward of Traces lands or is that title held by someone else?
27-02-2018T22:12:01,Twokinds,I should have said Trace lived in a super cool manor that's also invisible
27-02-2018T22:12:08,CrRAR,haha

27-02-2018T22:12:27,TheFDdriver,yes
27-02-2018T22:12:28,unsteddyphoenix,That would've been very clever and also well-received!
27-02-2018T22:12:29,TheFDdriver,lol
27-02-2018T22:12:30,unsteddyphoenix,Unlucky
27-02-2018T22:12:39,McClaw,Trace lives in the Manor if his choosing. :P
27-02-2018T22:12:41,Tru7h,hey is that the hagia sophia?
27-02-2018T22:12:54,Dimensional,Trace lives in an invisible castle in the sky.
27-02-2018T22:12:55,Whitestripes,The super secret invisible dragon sized super fortified castle
27-02-2018T22:12:58,TheFDdriver,you can always add it like a secret base
27-02-2018T22:13:02,ZephyrTWolffox,Just give it a cloaking device and then it can be
27-02-2018T22:13:03,unsteddyphoenix,Ever read the The Emporers New Mansion?  Classic tale
27-02-2018T22:13:08,CrimsonHelsing,And has everyone forgotten Trace is the DUKE of the city! xD
27-02-2018T22:13:10,Twokinds,Also it's not shorter it's just  farther away!
27-02-2018T22:13:18,CrRAR,The staff maybe has a vanishing bonus feature?
27-02-2018T22:13:19,McClaw,"What if the manor /can/ be invisible, but Trace has to be there to keep the spell running?"
27-02-2018T22:13:22,ProsePro7,Who is managing all this land while Trace has been wondering around?
27-02-2018T22:13:35,InTheLionsDen,Rose
27-02-2018T22:13:39,ZephyrTWolffox,Rose maybe?
27-02-2018T22:13:46,Twokinds,That distant tower and the domed portion are separated from the front by the inner gardens
27-02-2018T22:13:46,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
27-02-2018T22:13:47,ProsePro7,So she is the steward

27-02-2018T22:14:20,unsteddyphoenix,Are they all the same height then?
27-02-2018T22:14:21,Whitestripes,I thought the dome was a garden
27-02-2018T22:14:24,Twokinds,"The place has an inner cortyard, it's sort of a square shape"
27-02-2018T22:14:36,TheFDdriver,too fancy for my taste

27-02-2018T22:15:57,BadFoMo,I would live to see a floorplan of the manor.

27-02-2018T22:24:59,NezumiYuki,"Hmmm not sure about that... I get the feeling that House Legacy's magic ward would encompass the entire grounds, so sneaking in any window door, or trying to phase through the walls outright, would get the intruders nuked regardless.  xD"

27-02-2018T22:25:24,Bgrmystr2,or did it update when trace lost his memories?

27-02-2018T22:26:20,Dimensional,I don't think the spell is tied to his memories. Though chances are the spell to turn the animals back into people was probably lost with Old Trace's memories.
