05-03-2018T00:03:20,Bgrmystr2,Tom sleeps hard probably because he works himself so hard
05-03-2018T00:03:29,Bgrmystr2,and his body tunes out everything else
05-03-2018T00:07:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I knew he worked because their mother‚Äôs reminded Mark that Tom sleeps later because he‚Äôs sometimes up working at times as early as 2:00 a.m.
05-03-2018T00:07:54,SpazztasticKiwi,At the time i didn‚Äôt know it was this that he did
05-03-2018T00:08:51,Bgrmystr2,Now you know.
05-03-2018T00:10:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Their hours are definitely different
05-03-2018T00:15:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Wonder how they do anything when Mark does visit. Has he ever sat in on a stream? I‚Äôd like to see Mark try a hand at drawing; he likes trying new things after all
05-03-2018T00:15:51,Bgrmystr2,Mark's drawn before
05-03-2018T00:15:57,Bgrmystr2,he's no artist
05-03-2018T00:15:59,Bgrmystr2,but he's done so
05-03-2018T00:17:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve seen that. But have you ever seen someone with no artistic knowledge be given the tools to make something? They can make things that you never thought of with tools that aren‚Äôt meant for certain jobs

05-03-2018T01:02:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"Beck, you ever used anything like Photomath for your work?"

05-03-2018T04:59:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"I was trying to find the stream recording that I first heard Tom, but I found myself reading the conversations in chat instead"
05-03-2018T05:03:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"I believe it‚Äôs just hit me Tom may not be a fan of animals because he‚Äôs allergic. I feel a bit stupid since that just now kind of hit me. Also, I saw how flowing the chat is"
