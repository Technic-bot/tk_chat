15-03-2018T00:48:57,Twokinds,I came across webcomics for the first time in 1999 and really wanted to make one myself after getting hooked on them.
15-03-2018T00:48:59,Twokinds,So I did
15-03-2018T00:58:56,Vatruvius,"Hmm...I did not even have internet at my house in 1999, well...my parents did it. I was only 2 at the time. :D Why did you choose the comic to be furry?"
15-03-2018T00:59:10,Vatruvius,didn't*
15-03-2018T01:07:35,Bgrmystr2,so young lol
15-03-2018T01:14:59,Vatruvius,I hope only being 20 is young.
15-03-2018T01:15:18,Bgrmystr2,yup
15-03-2018T01:35:08,Twokinds,The first webcomic I read had an anthro cat. I wanted to make something like that.
15-03-2018T01:35:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Cool
15-03-2018T01:36:45,Twokinds,"The internet was a lot more primative back then, so it was hard to find stuff. I didn't know about furries or anything like that until well after I started drawing them."
15-03-2018T01:37:25,Bgrmystr2,do you think it would have changed what you did if you did know back then?
15-03-2018T01:39:05,Vatruvius,That is pretty cool!
15-03-2018T01:39:05,Twokinds,Probably not.
15-03-2018T01:39:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"Who cares what everyone else thinks, huh?"
15-03-2018T01:40:40,Twokinds,There were other 'furry' comics back then. But most were just ALL anthro characters. I wanted a story with humans and anthros together.
15-03-2018T01:40:50,Twokinds,So I made Twokinds.
15-03-2018T01:41:00,SpazztasticKiwi,“No one can make you feel insecure unless you let them”
15-03-2018T01:41:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Something I learned in high school that I quoted to people often. They never had much of a comeback to it
15-03-2018T01:42:04,TheBeckoner,*Warning *Twokinds may have more than just two kinds.
15-03-2018T01:42:13,Twokinds,lol
15-03-2018T01:42:37,Twokinds,Yeah
15-03-2018T01:43:18,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s what I discovered. Though maybe the “two” kinds could more refrence those who judge on appearance and those who get to know the person first
15-03-2018T01:43:31,TheBeckoner,Still a good name imo.
15-03-2018T01:43:59,iliar,About Keidran anatomy. Have you developed it yourself? Or use reference?
15-03-2018T01:44:44,Twokinds,"They don't have a lot of differences, other than their legs."
15-03-2018T01:45:14,TheBeckoner,yah got weird legs kid. Turn out ur a cat
15-03-2018T01:45:19,TheBeckoner,turns*
15-03-2018T01:45:33,Twokinds,I think digitigrade legs just look better. Human feet on animal characters like Sonic just look WRONG. To me.
15-03-2018T01:46:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Like a lot of others - right there with you
15-03-2018T01:47:29,TheBeckoner,lol imagine a human with digitigrade legs...
15-03-2018T01:47:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Pass
15-03-2018T01:50:48,iliar,"Yes, I mean legs. I see how other artists drawing legs. When other artists draw human legs from furry... it's normal. This is not what I like, but it's okay. But sometimes they try to mix human and animal legs. Usually th"
15-03-2018T01:51:13,iliar,Usually the result is awful.
15-03-2018T01:52:42,SpazztasticKiwi,You think you’ll ever do anything other than TK?
15-03-2018T01:52:46,Vatruvius,I believe anatomy wise the legs are quite similar. The heal for us would be the net digit in the legs of animals. Common ancestry and all. Interesting how evolution causes so many differences between things with similar ancestry.
15-03-2018T01:53:14,Vatruvius,heel*
15-03-2018T01:53:20,Vatruvius,next*
15-03-2018T01:57:52,iliar,"@TheBeckoner When I think of the name, I think it means, not that there are only two races in the world. I think it means that there are a lot of interracial relationships in the comic."
15-03-2018T01:59:38,Vatruvius,^
15-03-2018T02:00:46,iliar,Just look:
15-03-2018T02:00:51,iliar,Trace/Flora - Human/Keidran
15-03-2018T02:00:55,iliar,Keith/Natani - Basitin/Keidran
15-03-2018T02:00:59,iliar,Daniels/Therie - Human/Keidran
15-03-2018T02:01:03,iliar,Euchre/Mary - Keidran/Human
15-03-2018T02:02:32,SpazztasticKiwi,You could say it hints at the “opposites attract” troupe too
15-03-2018T02:02:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Kinda but not really
15-03-2018T02:02:53,iliar,Even if you look at Cathleen and Cornelius. Technically they are Basitins. But this is eastern and western Basitins.
15-03-2018T02:07:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"When you’re in love, you don’t look at what the person is, you look at who"
15-03-2018T02:11:25,iliar,"Eric/em... not human girls - Human/Not human. And I can continue to list for a long time. I can remember only two relationships with characters of the same race: Trace/Saria, Zen/Lilith."
15-03-2018T02:17:17,Vatruvius,"What, did you expect threesomes? The closest you will get are the friendships like with Keith, Trace, Flora, Natani, etc. I rather like it."
15-03-2018T02:18:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I like the obvious differences that each couple likes about each other
15-03-2018T02:18:52,Vatruvius,I really like Keith's and Natani's relationship. Both are rediscovering who they are and growing as individuals while also growing their own relationship with eachother.
15-03-2018T02:20:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Those two are something else: “do you want to touch em?”
15-03-2018T02:20:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Both reactions are gold
15-03-2018T02:21:06,TheBeckoner,@iliar yeah. I was just doin a fun
15-03-2018T02:21:54,iliar,Hm... about Erick. Interesting what does he think about dragon girls. They fine too or he like only fluffy girls.
15-03-2018T02:22:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Give him time. Though scales may be less cuddleable than fur
15-03-2018T02:22:54,Vatruvius,"He said he was into Keidran mostly, but that Basitin are not unknown to him either. Dragons I would not assume."
15-03-2018T02:23:15,Vatruvius,Still...Eric is an idiot around Kat. Poor Kat.
15-03-2018T02:23:48,Vatruvius,He has a Keidran fetish and he can not even see a foot in front of him.
15-03-2018T02:24:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Just needs someone to beat him over the head with a book “Right. In. Front. Of. You.”
15-03-2018T02:25:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"And with her stunt with the expensive cloth, you’d think he’d see the flashing “Take a hint” sign"
15-03-2018T02:26:14,Vatruvius,"Someone just needs to burn all of his Keidran ""picture"" books right in front of him and then lock him in a room with Kat."
15-03-2018T02:27:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Like the sims: “Now kiss”
15-03-2018T02:28:01,Vatruvius,I never played the sims.
15-03-2018T02:28:09,SpazztasticKiwi,:ptv-shock:
15-03-2018T02:29:04,Vatruvius,Closest thing I have to Sims is Sim City.
15-03-2018T02:29:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Not perfect but a start
15-03-2018T02:29:41,Vatruvius,I am getting so nostalgic/home sick over Skyrim right now.
15-03-2018T02:30:03,Vatruvius,I have been listening to the soundtrack for that last few hours now as it randomly popped up in my feed.
15-03-2018T02:30:10,SpazztasticKiwi,You should try it though. You can have someone born and get married and expecting their own baby in as little as a day
15-03-2018T02:30:13,Vatruvius,My last timed played on steam was July last year.
15-03-2018T02:30:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Well go play it
15-03-2018T02:30:54,Vatruvius,It's downloading. I deleted it because I could not get my...let me count...
15-03-2018T02:32:03,Vatruvius,...my 72 mods to work.
15-03-2018T02:33:04,Vatruvius,"It turns into hours of troubleshooting so I just stopped after having done that so much. Now, SKSE64 is out so I have to spend hours just looking for cool new mods to add/redownload and figure out compatability."
15-03-2018T02:33:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Have fun with that
15-03-2018T02:34:40,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: did you bother seeing if any of them are compatible with each other?
15-03-2018T02:34:51,Vatruvius,It is surprisingly fun actually. I get all excited seeing all these new features that I will get to play with. I am tailoring the game to how I want it to be.
15-03-2018T02:35:14,Vatruvius,Yes...and it was painstaking @Bgrmystr2
15-03-2018T02:35:21,Bgrmystr2,and it still didn't work? lol
15-03-2018T02:35:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though Eric’s a bit of a smooth talker, I don’t feel he’s bad, just low skilled at body language"
15-03-2018T02:35:32,Bgrmystr2,not enough combatibility checking
15-03-2018T02:35:34,Vatruvius,It did but a patch came out and everything blew up.
15-03-2018T02:35:38,Bgrmystr2,ahhh
15-03-2018T02:35:40,Bgrmystr2,that'll do it
15-03-2018T02:35:49,Vatruvius,Yup.
15-03-2018T02:35:59,Bgrmystr2,What I recommend when you have so many mods
15-03-2018T02:36:05,Bgrmystr2,is to take like half of them out all at once
15-03-2018T02:36:10,Bgrmystr2,and see if it works
15-03-2018T02:36:17,Bgrmystr2,"if it does, then check the other half"
15-03-2018T02:36:27,Bgrmystr2,if it doesn't.. still check the other half :V
15-03-2018T02:36:38,Vatruvius,"Since I am an organized person though, I have these 72 mods in a spreadsheet, alphabetized, and separated into groups based on what they did."
15-03-2018T02:36:41,Bgrmystr2,"if both don't work, then you know off the bat you have two mods that don't work with the new patch"
15-03-2018T02:37:24,Bgrmystr2,that's basically how I used to play when I would use 3rd party units when I'd play Total Annihilation
15-03-2018T02:37:33,Bgrmystr2,I'd end up with like.. hundreds of units
15-03-2018T02:37:42,Bgrmystr2,and then the game would crash
15-03-2018T02:37:46,Vatruvius,"Yeah, easier said then done. Over the last year I have gotten better at it and my main problem was installing some modes directly into the game directory where as now I solely use a mod manager."
15-03-2018T02:38:13,Bgrmystr2,lucky that your game can have a mod manager lol
15-03-2018T02:38:17,Bgrmystr2,:v
15-03-2018T02:38:47,Vatruvius,Nexus Mod Manager all the way! They have mods for every game though some games are more popular on other sites then theirs.
15-03-2018T02:40:10,Vatruvius,"Yeah, I actually end up using three different managers/compilers to get all the mods working. It is a cray long process but so worth it once it is done. Plus, I am getting into computer science so I kind of just have a knack for this stuff."
15-03-2018T02:41:24,Bgrmystr2,every game in existance? Cuz I bet you not.
15-03-2018T02:41:35,Vatruvius,"Not every game, but a lot."
15-03-2018T02:41:43,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, I kinda doubt that"
15-03-2018T02:41:56,Bgrmystr2,gonna be kinda hard to code for all games
15-03-2018T02:42:44,Vatruvius,They have 520 games they support.
15-03-2018T02:44:08,Vatruvius,"And it really is not ""coding"" for every game. Their manager is a general manager. Supported games know where to look but it can also be done manually with file locations, etc."
15-03-2018T02:46:26,Vatruvius,"So you could just download the manager, tell it where to look for a specific game, load any mods you downloaded manually via files, then tell the manager to load them all together in the game directory. It is nice because it is easy to deactivate."
15-03-2018T02:49:17,Bgrmystr2,520 games is not even remotely close to a lot of games XD
15-03-2018T02:49:27,Bgrmystr2,there's prolly hundreds of thousands just on steam alone
15-03-2018T02:49:32,Bgrmystr2,nevermind non-steam games
15-03-2018T02:50:07,Vatruvius,"It is a lot if you have to look through them all. I do not even have close to 520 games in my steam library. So, no, not a lot compared to all games, but quite a bit for any individual looking for mods."
15-03-2018T02:50:11,Bgrmystr2,"all the games on consoles and stuff, though it likely wouldn't work with any of those"
15-03-2018T02:50:32,Bgrmystr2,I don't have 520 games either but it's not made for one person so
15-03-2018T02:50:34,Bgrmystr2,:P
15-03-2018T02:50:56,Vatruvius,"Some mods do have console support but Nexus does not do that, just the games themselves."
15-03-2018T02:51:17,Vatruvius,They got the big titles.
15-03-2018T02:51:45,Vatruvius,"I got to get to bed, got an early morning with a lot of work to do. I will see if I can catch the stream tonight."
15-03-2018T19:09:03,TheBeckoner,Probably gonna miss the first bit of the stream but should catch most of it. I've been missing them lately...
15-03-2018T19:26:32,Bgrmystr2,then stop missing them
15-03-2018T19:51:11,Mippy,And so the waiteing begins... *goes to watch Mark*
15-03-2018T19:55:13,Bgrmystr2,lol.. better be a short vid xD

15-03-2018T23:16:37,Nekonny,i saw it back when I was still doing CB... so perhaps 5 years?
15-03-2018T23:16:49,SageSaga,was it new then?
15-03-2018T23:16:57,SageSaga,cant you tell based on the style?
15-03-2018T23:17:12,BadFoMo,Google; Anime Catgirl Press /or/ Machine?
15-03-2018T23:17:14,Bgrmystr2,"This might be an older series, but is it ufo ultramaiden valkyrie?"

15-03-2018T23:17:49,NezumiYuki,Pffffff my twitch fav has pushed back his stream slot by a day....   XD  Well that's fine.. It means I got more time for more awesome Twokinds and Nekonny und Sage!
15-03-2018T23:17:58,Ordithus,"Hm... never thought of this before.  Interesting that most TK wolves are brown, when real wolves are mostly grey."
15-03-2018T23:18:05,MelodicStream,and melo! 😄
15-03-2018T23:18:45,Ordithus,Green cap!

15-03-2018T23:18:57,Bgrmystr2,"hm, strikes the one i thought off the list"
15-03-2018T23:20:11,SageSaga,when they danced was it just as cats or was it with a person?
15-03-2018T23:20:39,Nekonny,as cats
15-03-2018T23:20:41,Tharkis,i think i'm drunk
15-03-2018T23:20:50,MelodicStream,"actually, there might be a subreddit for that"
15-03-2018T23:20:55,Nekonny,"they try talking to each other,  all that comes out is nyan"
15-03-2018T23:21:10,MelodicStream,they might be able to help better 🤔
15-03-2018T23:21:25,Nekonny,so one of them breaks out into song and the others follow suit. all the words of the song are nyan though
15-03-2018T23:21:32,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Oh, Tharkis"
15-03-2018T23:21:44,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: that's definitely not something I've seen lol

15-03-2018T23:21:57,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Also, Keith's scar is badass"
15-03-2018T23:22:20,Combak,Thought: Is there fur dye in the world of TK?
15-03-2018T23:22:23,NezumiYuki,Keith is fortunate not to have lost an eye
15-03-2018T23:22:29,ItsActuallyKopyKat,^

15-03-2018T23:23:20,MelodicStream,he also lost his decency. where are his footwraps? why is he naked? 😭
15-03-2018T23:23:22,SageSaga,i guess the easiest way to look for it would be to look of a Nyan song but- yeeeeah
15-03-2018T23:23:56,NezumiYuki,Nyan song?  XDD Good luck with that!
15-03-2018T23:24:06,Ordithus,Kaylin is cute
