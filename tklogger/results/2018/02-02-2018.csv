02-02-2018T00:49:12,KawaiiFlora,the water is calm as well so he couldnt have fell in

02-02-2018T00:49:27,NezumiYuki,Obv
02-02-2018T00:49:35,MetalAppleSauce,Or did carver dodge the duck?
02-02-2018T00:49:36,NezumiYuki,because the duck comes from the 24 and a half
02-02-2018T00:49:47,MetalAppleSauce,CENTURY
02-02-2018T00:49:58,CrRAR,I think the credit is Raine's for the unperturbed duck.
02-02-2018T00:49:59,Serpentfrog,So he's Duck Dodgers from the 21st and a half century?

02-02-2018T00:51:49,TheVileOne,falling into that tub would cause water to go everywhere
02-02-2018T00:52:05,KawaiiFlora,well there would still be water displacement even if he was teleported
02-02-2018T00:52:17,CrRAR,"yeah, can't violate physics after all"
02-02-2018T00:52:19,Lauriana,^
02-02-2018T00:52:22,Lauriana,Agreed.
02-02-2018T00:52:28,NezumiYuki,No replacement for displacement
02-02-2018T00:52:29,Combak,Unless you waqnt to discuss the problems of two objects occupying the same space.
02-02-2018T00:52:31,Ordithus,What's the speed of teleportation.  How long did the water have to displace?
02-02-2018T00:52:34,Combak,*want
02-02-2018T00:52:52,TheVileOne,oh it was teleportation wut?

02-02-2018T00:52:57,SageSaga,what if the water just got fused with im?

02-02-2018T00:53:47,Combak,Yes Nezumi?
02-02-2018T00:53:48,NezumiYuki,We are over Logic-ing it
02-02-2018T00:53:52,MetalAppleSauce,"therefore unless some ex-machina happened, carver DED"
02-02-2018T00:53:52,Ordithus,"Carver would have learned the lesson of not missing when teleporting, except he ded."
02-02-2018T00:53:56,SageSaga,impossible
02-02-2018T00:54:01,Combak,You can never over-logic something!
02-02-2018T00:54:06,unsteddyphoenix,only nerds hate logic
02-02-2018T00:54:10,MetalAppleSauce,But that's just a theory
02-02-2018T00:54:12,MetalAppleSauce,A COMIC THEORY
02-02-2018T00:54:36,KawaiiFlora,it is solid scientific fact :P
02-02-2018T00:54:57,MetalAppleSauce,I know
02-02-2018T00:55:12,Serpentfrog,Wouldn't the water be liquid fact?
02-02-2018T00:55:27,MetalAppleSauce,Carver's the solid in this equasion
02-02-2018T00:55:28,unsteddyphoenix,:o

02-02-2018T00:55:39,Serpentfrog,Fluid includes gas.
02-02-2018T00:56:04,NezumiYuki,"Ahhh yes of course, pardon my logic flub?  XD"
02-02-2018T00:56:22,KawaiiFlora,just speak of simple logic and hope that you dont mess even that up lol
02-02-2018T00:56:22,MetalAppleSauce,Carver's bodily fluids
02-02-2018T00:56:25,NezumiYuki,"Solid, Liquid, Gas... Plasma.. etc"
02-02-2018T00:56:43,Nekonny,you know... I'm starting to worry that this animation meme that I'm doing will be pulled due to copyright
02-02-2018T00:56:50,KawaiiFlora,what is not logic is how 0 * infinity is undefined and not 0
02-02-2018T00:56:52,Char89TheCharizard,I'm going to bed. Maybe I'll see the finished comic sometime tomorrow. Maybe

02-02-2018T01:06:17,MetalAppleSauce,"@KawaiiFlora i have the page open in another tab. she says they aren't ""classified"" as keidran because they are more primitive"
02-02-2018T01:06:25,MetalAppleSauce,...and then there's the basitins
02-02-2018T01:07:00,RedDeath2018,Basitins are the political a-holes
02-02-2018T01:07:09,thestooge,You don't say?

02-02-2018T01:09:21,MetalAppleSauce,"But yeah, my theory is that basitins, regardless of what ""animal"" they are, are just a race of keidran that decided ""nah you stripey and woofey fucks are too unrefined for our taste, we aren't keidran anymore"""

02-02-2018T01:10:21,KawaiiFlora,I get they are uptight but I would think with fur that would be an unecessary jump for them to make.
02-02-2018T01:10:37,NezumiYuki,I ask the same thing about my fellow NIMH rats... like... why do we need this cloth on us anyway?
02-02-2018T01:10:59,MetalAppleSauce,They probably saw what humans found to be naked about keidran and decided to agree
02-02-2018T01:11:22,RedDeath2018,"if I were king I would just let everyone on the island wear whatever they want, whatever they don’t want, and just be super chill about it"
02-02-2018T01:11:31,Nekonny,"JK, it's 60 outside"
02-02-2018T01:11:32,MetalAppleSauce,Now POOF basitins wear clothing and have certain rules for nakedness
02-02-2018T01:11:43,Serpentfrog,60K?
02-02-2018T01:11:45,Nekonny,and probably 70 something inside
02-02-2018T01:11:52,KawaiiFlora,@RedDeath2018 even if you did that I think they would still wear clothing how they do now
02-02-2018T01:11:53,thestooge,"I'm gonna head to bed, Good night everyone!"
02-02-2018T01:11:58,KawaiiFlora,Bye thestooge
02-02-2018T01:11:59,CrRAR,bye stooge
02-02-2018T01:12:02,NezumiYuki,Whoa.. 60 Kelvin?   HOlyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!
02-02-2018T01:12:02,Nekonny,they are dropping like flies
02-02-2018T01:12:16,BadFoMo,Good night.
02-02-2018T01:12:20,CrRAR,-273 represent!
02-02-2018T01:12:21,KawaiiFlora,With the way Keith reacts about the decency laws even after being banished for some time
02-02-2018T01:12:22,RedDeath2018,Night
02-02-2018T01:13:09,CrRAR,it's instinctual
02-02-2018T01:13:10,RedDeath2018,@KawaiiFlora Keith barely give a crap about the laws
02-02-2018T01:13:18,BadFoMo,BRB.
02-02-2018T01:13:26,CrRAR,"plus, it's not like he wanted to get"
02-02-2018T01:13:27,MetalAppleSauce,Keith was probably so used to not having to deal with that shit since he was in laura's village the whole time
02-02-2018T01:13:28,KawaiiFlora,When Alaric was breaking the decency laws it embarrased Keith
02-02-2018T01:13:31,CrRAR,double banished
02-02-2018T01:13:34,CrRAR,XD
02-02-2018T01:13:35,RedDeath2018,Lol
02-02-2018T01:13:47,Nekonny,I should at least be able to finish up the eyes
02-02-2018T01:13:55,KawaiiFlora,"Also with Alarics ""loophole"""
02-02-2018T01:13:59,SageSaga,o-o
02-02-2018T01:14:31,RedDeath2018,The mystical loophole
02-02-2018T01:14:49,MetalAppleSauce,"""If it's for art, it's not nudity"" my ass"
02-02-2018T01:14:57,RedDeath2018,Lol
02-02-2018T01:14:58,CrRAR,Double banishment probably results in exile to freezingtown in the north
02-02-2018T01:14:59,KawaiiFlora,I wonder what the background for this picture will be
02-02-2018T01:15:09,KawaiiFlora,Well its the same way in our world Metal
02-02-2018T01:15:17,MetalAppleSauce,In public?

02-02-2018T01:17:26,KawaiiFlora,I prefer drawing with stylus and touch screen than mouse and keyboard
02-02-2018T01:17:31,MetalAppleSauce,Still confused on why Brahn's daughter is such a peeper
02-02-2018T01:17:38,NezumiYuki,Oh god... speaking of tablets... that's another thing I need to get myself after a replacement PC

02-02-2018T01:17:51,SageSaga,"anyone who ""prefers"" to use mouse and keyboard to draw - is just wrong"
02-02-2018T01:18:10,RedDeath2018,It sucks drawing with a mouse
02-02-2018T01:18:12,Serpentfrog,Real men use their teeth.

02-02-2018T01:20:10,SageSaga,i think Tom has bought the most cintiqs? Or is he tied with me-
02-02-2018T01:20:21,KawaiiFlora,Well a drawing doesnt suck if you put effort into it
02-02-2018T01:20:23,Nekonny,How many?
02-02-2018T01:20:24,unsteddyphoenix,Cintiq-off
02-02-2018T01:20:30,KawaiiFlora,It is just a representation of your own skill
02-02-2018T01:20:38,unsteddyphoenix,Throw cintiqs at each other until you run out

02-02-2018T01:22:03,Combak,Night all!
02-02-2018T01:22:05,NezumiYuki,Cintiq is basically a draw on monitor
02-02-2018T01:22:06,RedDeath2018,I haven’t changed my mind on sticking to paper
02-02-2018T01:22:08,Dadrobit,Cya
02-02-2018T01:22:08,Lauriana,Night^^
02-02-2018T01:22:09,SageSaga,take care

02-02-2018T01:22:48,Bgrmystr2,gnight combak
02-02-2018T01:22:58,RedDeath2018,Is it easier on a  drawing tablet than on paper
02-02-2018T01:23:07,JaydenMozingo,a little
02-02-2018T01:23:22,Serpentfrog,Draw on monitor: markers not included.
02-02-2018T01:23:23,KawaiiFlora,easier to erase and the photoshop tools are so handy
02-02-2018T01:23:27,Dadrobit,"No, just more access to diffent tools."
02-02-2018T01:23:29,JaydenMozingo,it depends on the person
02-02-2018T01:23:33,NezumiYuki,"Well I don't know about Easier, but it's certainly different than paper"
02-02-2018T01:23:33,RedDeath2018,Ok
02-02-2018T01:24:04,NezumiYuki,There is a learning curve to over come about drawing and not looking at your hands at the same time
02-02-2018T01:24:04,ZRO4825,I think it's easier. The tablet comes equipped with CTRL+Z
02-02-2018T01:24:13,Bgrmystr2,ctrl-z is op
02-02-2018T01:24:29,RedDeath2018,What does it do
02-02-2018T01:24:35,SageSaga,Ctrl Z is just a really good eraser
02-02-2018T01:24:36,Bgrmystr2,It's the undo feature
02-02-2018T01:24:37,KawaiiFlora,undo
02-02-2018T01:24:42,RedDeath2018,Oh
02-02-2018T01:25:05,RedDeath2018,Still trying to figure things out
02-02-2018T01:25:05,ZRO4825,Best eraser ever.
02-02-2018T01:25:19,Bgrmystr2,"a physical pencil or pen may have erasers, but they end up running out while also distorting the paper or whatever you're working on"
02-02-2018T01:25:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,alt + ctrl + Z is better imo
02-02-2018T01:25:26,NezumiYuki,Well best eraser upto your history limit
02-02-2018T01:25:45,Serpentfrog,The best eraser is actually the Big Crunch.
02-02-2018T01:25:47,SageSaga,think of it this way- you learn from your mistakes- Ctrl Z makes you less afraid to make those mistakes and make things better
02-02-2018T01:25:50,KawaiiFlora,if you need more than that then u screwed up nezumi xD
02-02-2018T01:26:02,CrRAR,haha
02-02-2018T01:26:13,NezumiYuki,In agreement with Sage
02-02-2018T01:26:30,NezumiYuki,Ctrl-z helps build up your confidence
02-02-2018T01:26:33,RedDeath2018,Ima go hide in a corner now
02-02-2018T01:26:39,KawaiiFlora,I never thought about it that way. I thought of it like I can swipe however i want and not worry lol
02-02-2018T01:27:01,RedDeath2018,👨🏻‍💻
02-02-2018T01:27:15,Lauriana,"Looking great, TK^^"
02-02-2018T01:27:43,SageSaga,when we hit Ctrl Z its because we know we messed up and that we can do better- it isnt a crutch. Plenty of people draw and dont use Ctrl Z simply because they dont realize they screwed up
02-02-2018T01:27:57,NezumiYuki,^ Agreed
02-02-2018T01:28:00,Lauriana,^
02-02-2018T01:28:07,KawaiiFlora,Dont know some mistakes until you draw the bigger picture
02-02-2018T01:28:17,RedDeath2018,Ok Ctrl Z undoes stuff thank you
02-02-2018T01:28:29,KawaiiFlora,My mistakes mostly are getting the whole picture to fit on the page lol
02-02-2018T01:28:41,Lauriana,XDlol
02-02-2018T01:28:46,SageSaga,digital helps there- just make the page BIGGER
02-02-2018T01:29:05,RedDeath2018,Paper doesn’t do that
02-02-2018T01:29:09,Lauriana,I usually end up shrinking it to save time X3
02-02-2018T01:29:15,KawaiiFlora,You can make the page bigger? I thought u just make image smaller
02-02-2018T01:29:20,SageSaga,shrinking is bad
02-02-2018T01:29:21,NezumiYuki,My mistakes are generally not using enough basic shapes to flesh stuff out with.. and later I wonder why some of my anatomy looks wonky... xD
02-02-2018T01:29:28,unsteddyphoenix,largify
02-02-2018T01:29:30,KawaiiFlora,How do you make it bigger??
02-02-2018T01:29:39,Lauriana,"Sure you can make paper bigger, just tape another page to the side or top."
02-02-2018T01:29:58,JaydenMozingo,"ooh, water droplets"
02-02-2018T01:30:04,MetalAppleSauce,@KawaiiFlora what flora says about her chest every night
02-02-2018T01:30:06,NezumiYuki,The digital equivalent to that is expanding the canvas.  :D
02-02-2018T01:30:07,KawaiiFlora,Tom loves his water droplets
02-02-2018T01:30:18,KawaiiFlora,lel
02-02-2018T01:30:22,NezumiYuki,Tom likes things wet
02-02-2018T01:30:24,NezumiYuki,LOLOLOL
02-02-2018T01:30:26,SageSaga,you can change the canvas size without affecting the drawing unless you are silly and drawing on the canvas
02-02-2018T01:30:30,JaydenMozingo,I might deticate tomorrow to drawing. I need to practice more
02-02-2018T01:30:35,CrRAR,"Yeah, I think of it kind of like right after you take a shot with a basketball, you can kind of sense a bad shot the second it leaves your hand."
02-02-2018T01:30:39,RedDeath2018,Phone derped on my lol
02-02-2018T01:30:40,SageSaga,rule number one of digital art- draw on layers
02-02-2018T01:30:43,CrRAR,Art is about matching your mental picture to a real medium... eventually you blur the line between mental picture and your medium.
02-02-2018T01:30:47,KawaiiFlora,"Ye, layers are my best bud"
02-02-2018T01:30:50,RedDeath2018,Me*
02-02-2018T01:30:51,ZRO4825,Layers are love &lt;3
02-02-2018T01:30:53,Nekonny,lots of layers
02-02-2018T01:30:57,Lauriana,Always use layers &lt;&lt;
02-02-2018T01:30:58,CrRAR,mmmm
02-02-2018T01:31:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,always primer your canvas with a thin layer of titanium white
02-02-2018T01:31:10,Lauriana,"Unless you quick draw, then just use 'layer'"
02-02-2018T01:31:26,Nekonny,happy trees?
02-02-2018T01:31:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yep

02-02-2018T02:09:35,ZRO4825,"Not quite sure how deciding to draw at this time of the morning is quitting on life, but okay, whatevs."
02-02-2018T02:09:41,Bgrmystr2,is wanting to draw at 1 in the morning a problem?

02-02-2018T02:11:16,ZRO4825,"Rathians I've killed a few times. Rathalos, not so much. He always goes away before I can get him dead."
02-02-2018T02:11:16,Dadrobit,Screw Nergigante.

02-02-2018T02:12:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Eeek
02-02-2018T02:12:15,Dadrobit,"Ya, Kirin"
02-02-2018T02:12:24,Dadrobit,Kirin I finally got through.
02-02-2018T02:12:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,WooHoo
02-02-2018T02:15:19,Dadrobit,What weapon are you using ZRO?
02-02-2018T02:16:24,ZRO4825,"Great Sword, Long Sword, and occasionally bow."
02-02-2018T02:16:56,Dadrobit,"Ohhh, LS is my secondary behind bow."
02-02-2018T02:17:15,SageSaga,"ive been using Sword and Board, Hammer, Bow- but i want to start using the other ones- i know how to play every weapon rather well though"
02-02-2018T02:20:44,ZRO4825,Was tinkering with some of the other weapons earlier but haven't really decided to make a swap yet
02-02-2018T02:21:22,SageSaga,i have been slowing my progress on purpose for some friends to catch up some
02-02-2018T02:22:00,SageSaga,but i went ahead and got High Rank today so i can start working on my HR armor and weapons while i wait
02-02-2018T02:22:55,SageSaga,so i went into a HR expedition and well - 3 randos joined me- all with HR armor and weapons...
02-02-2018T02:23:20,SageSaga,they each died 6+ times while i died once
02-02-2018T02:23:28,SageSaga,im wondering if they know how to dodge-
02-02-2018T02:25:01,Dadrobit,"Two kinds of Randos. ""Oh my god will you PLEASE dodge!"" and ""How the Hell are you doing this?"""
02-02-2018T02:26:09,SageSaga,"im experienced in the game, so i am pretty good- but i know people that are way better"
02-02-2018T02:27:18,SageSaga,ive never had a rando that impressed me though
02-02-2018T02:27:19,Simba007,Is this Tom's channel?
02-02-2018T02:27:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,does it say twokinds in the url?
02-02-2018T02:28:51,Simba007,You to me?
02-02-2018T02:29:17,Bgrmystr2,"no, marv to the other guy that asked a question. ._."
02-02-2018T02:29:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,if it say twokinds in the url then yes your in Toms channel
02-02-2018T02:31:54,Simba007,"OK. And when he has streams? I'm first on this site. Previously, just 20X on YouTube looked"
02-02-2018T02:32:36,Bgrmystr2,"You just missed one, actually."
02-02-2018T02:32:50,SageSaga,I take it English isn't your first language?
02-02-2018T02:33:01,Bgrmystr2,"He streams on Wed, Fri, and Sunday, the schedule is at the top of the chat."
02-02-2018T02:33:13,Dadrobit,So far only one guy comes to mind. Some dude using a great sword who absolutely shit on an HR Odogaron.
02-02-2018T02:33:33,Dadrobit,Using an armor set I haven't even seen the monster for yet.
02-02-2018T02:35:47,SageSaga,Could have been an armor set from the Tailriders special armors?
02-02-2018T02:36:02,Simba007,"SageSaga Personally, I do not know him at all. I am Russian(If of course this appeal was to me)"
02-02-2018T02:36:30,Dadrobit,"Hmmm, that's very possible. It had all these glowing flowing tendrils coming off of it."
02-02-2018T02:37:26,SageSaga,"Simba007, sorry we usually use context to tell who is talking to whom rather than saying their ID or name"
02-02-2018T02:37:45,Dadrobit,"Your English isn't that bad. I know plenty of folks who wouldn't ever even use ""appeal"" lol"
02-02-2018T02:38:04,TheBeckoner,is entertained
02-02-2018T02:38:42,SageSaga,appeal is not commonly used in conversational English
02-02-2018T02:38:48,Bgrmystr2,"not that it was the best word though, dadro"
02-02-2018T02:39:35,Bgrmystr2,"still, it's not bad yeah"
02-02-2018T02:39:41,Simba007,SageSaga I did not understand you...
02-02-2018T02:40:45,SageSaga,"Simba007, We don't address people by name normally. We read what is said and use the way it is said to tell who someone is talking to"
02-02-2018T02:42:17,Simba007,"To put it bluntly, I again did not understand but I think you mean that I should not enter your nickname"
02-02-2018T02:43:35,SageSaga,"Simba007, It is OK to do that. It is just not normal in Conversational English"
02-02-2018T02:44:09,iliar,"Имелось в виду, что далеко не всегда нужно называть имя человека, что бы было понятно, кому адресовано сообщение. Просто по контексту понятно о чем идет речь."
02-02-2018T02:44:42,Bgrmystr2,Iliar speaks Russian? :O
02-02-2018T02:45:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,of course iliar is skynet after all
02-02-2018T02:45:14,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: True.
02-02-2018T02:45:16,Dadrobit,Iliar is Russian yo
02-02-2018T02:45:22,iliar,Yeap. I'm Russian too.
02-02-2018T02:45:27,Bgrmystr2,Russian Skynet?
02-02-2018T02:45:39,SageSaga,thank you btw
02-02-2018T02:46:02,Twokinds,I am Russian too
02-02-2018T02:46:05,TheBeckoner,So is he crazy iliar?
02-02-2018T02:46:11,TheBeckoner,Tom is everything.
02-02-2018T02:46:12,Simba007,Russian is much harder than your English
02-02-2018T02:46:13,Bgrmystr2,Tom pls
02-02-2018T02:46:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,today I learned
02-02-2018T02:48:05,Simba007,And at what time in Moscow did Tom stream?
02-02-2018T02:48:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,6 hours ago
02-02-2018T02:49:13,iliar,At about 6 am on Wednesdays and Fridays. And at midnight on Sunday.
02-02-2018T02:49:13,Simba007,And on Sunday?
02-02-2018T02:49:49,Simba007,Thank you
02-02-2018T02:50:20,Bgrmystr2,"wow, it's super late for Russia when tom streams"
02-02-2018T02:50:30,Bgrmystr2,late / early
02-02-2018T02:51:02,iliar,I mean on the night of Sunday to Monday.
02-02-2018T02:54:31,Bgrmystr2,"This page looks good sage, that face in the last panel though"
02-02-2018T02:54:51,SageSaga,what about the face?
02-02-2018T02:54:51,Bgrmystr2,"I don't think Nyna really knows what she's up against, though"
02-02-2018T02:55:05,Bgrmystr2,"Oh, just comic context, nothing wrong with it"
02-02-2018T02:55:28,SageSaga,ok just making sure - i made several tweaks so i thought i may have missed something
02-02-2018T02:55:42,Bgrmystr2,yeah I like the expressions
02-02-2018T02:55:45,iliar,Yeap. Tom's Sunday streams it's a reason why I need stick a needle in my eye on Monday
02-02-2018T02:55:55,Bgrmystr2,and I like the change you did to the first panel too
02-02-2018T02:56:20,SageSaga,"the mouth open made it look like she was doing the ""gag"" motion"
