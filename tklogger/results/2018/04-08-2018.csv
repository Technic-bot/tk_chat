date,user,comment
04-08-2018T00:23:23,SpazztasticKiwi,That makes sense
04-08-2018T00:23:29,TorqueEmUp,I can't imagine setting up OBS to stream would be that big of deal
04-08-2018T00:24:11,TorqueEmUp,"Also, I thought Tom also had a laptop? Because didn't he do a test stream when at SDCC?"
04-08-2018T00:24:30,TorqueEmUp,But the internet there just sucked too much for it to be viable?
04-08-2018T00:24:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd heard of a test stream but not much past that
04-08-2018T00:25:21,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, because the internet sucked, but he was still able to do stuff, even if the stream itself was junk."
04-08-2018T00:25:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Probably didn‚Äôt see that one
04-08-2018T00:26:31,TorqueEmUp,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_b5xPrvbz88
04-08-2018T00:26:36,TorqueEmUp,That one.
04-08-2018T00:28:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Date was when I worked
04-08-2018T00:28:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Which is the general story for me nowadays. Stream times meet exactly when I‚Äôm gonna be on shift
04-08-2018T00:30:57,TorqueEmUp,Well you were there right at the start of that test stream from the chat. lol
04-08-2018T00:31:48,TorqueEmUp,from the chat in that video. I mean
04-08-2018T00:32:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Probably break or lunch
04-08-2018T00:36:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I do see he responded to the comment on Justice‚Äôs card number
04-08-2018T00:38:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"They vary because The Fool is ‚ÄúCard 0‚Äù. Some count this as a one instead and number accordingly while others start the next card, The Magician, as 1"
04-08-2018T00:38:45,TorqueEmUp,"I have no idea what you are talking about when it comes to these ""card numbers"" :P"
04-08-2018T00:39:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Tarot cards - for fortune stuff
04-08-2018T00:39:40,TorqueEmUp,oh... yeah not my thing.
04-08-2018T00:40:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Each of the 22 major arcana has a number 0-21
04-08-2018T00:41:34,SpazztasticKiwi,It can be a headache and sound like another language if you‚Äôve never experienced anything about them before
04-08-2018T01:29:02,Dadrobit,Closest I've ever come to them was Escaflowne
04-08-2018T01:38:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Either you sneezed while typing or I have a word to avoid trying to pronounce
04-08-2018T01:39:10,Bgrmystr2,it's not that hard Kiwi
04-08-2018T01:39:40,Bgrmystr2,Ess - kah - flow - nay
04-08-2018T01:39:51,Bgrmystr2,:u
04-08-2018T01:40:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I would‚Äôve said ess-ka-flown
04-08-2018T01:40:21,Bgrmystr2,"it's japanese, not english"
04-08-2018T01:40:26,Bgrmystr2,so you'd be wrong :v
04-08-2018T01:40:34,Bgrmystr2,and now you know
04-08-2018T01:41:09,SpazztasticKiwi,That explains it. Different countries have different pronunciation rules for letters
04-08-2018T01:41:48,Bgrmystr2,they don't even have letters
04-08-2018T01:41:49,Bgrmystr2,xD
04-08-2018T01:41:56,Bgrmystr2,they use sounds
04-08-2018T01:43:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh I got a question for you. Just in general really
04-08-2018T01:45:07,SpazztasticKiwi,What do you think they do with the change in those coin counting machines
04-08-2018T01:58:46,SpazztasticKiwi,2 am. I‚Äôm out üõå
04-08-2018T02:27:08,Dadrobit,Japanese do have letters though. Katakana and Hirigana are their alphabets.
04-08-2018T02:27:53,Dadrobit,Source: I took a year of Japanese a few years back because I wanted to play Monster Hunter on Playstation 3.
04-08-2018T02:28:41,Dadrobit,And the PS3 MH games were all only available in Japanese.
04-08-2018T02:42:12,Bgrmystr2,yeah you know why those two exist?
04-08-2018T02:42:22,Bgrmystr2,for translation to other languages
04-08-2018T02:42:58,Bgrmystr2,general-use japanese is all moonrunes
04-08-2018T03:08:44,Dadrobit,That's not correct. Hirigana is the alphabet that is used in generally informal writing for Japanese. Katakana is the alphabet used to translate TO Japanese foreign concepts like Football and foreign names. But they are both identical in sounds.
04-08-2018T03:09:31,Dadrobit,A-I-U-E-O-Ka-Ki-Ku-Ke-Ko etc....
04-08-2018T03:10:27,Dadrobit,But they are absolutely still just regular old alphabets that have been in use for pretty much over a thousand years.
04-08-2018T03:12:42,Dadrobit,"Kanji is the ""moon runes"" you're talking about, and they are absolutely still widely used, but very rarey if ever will you encounter things that are purely written as such simply because A) It's getting out-dated and B) There are some things that simply"
04-08-2018T03:13:06,Dadrobit,don't have Kanji characters.
04-08-2018T03:13:14,Dadrobit,B )*
04-08-2018T03:16:31,Bgrmystr2,"Dadro have you ever seen images or watched video of people walking down the streets of japan, rural or otherwise? Cuz literally everything, even newspaper is all symbols"
04-08-2018T03:16:50,Bgrmystr2,books too
04-08-2018T03:17:09,Bgrmystr2,seems fairly rare to actually see any alphabet
04-08-2018T03:17:37,Dadrobit,Same as if you walk down The Vegas Strip. All symbols. You're just familiar with them as they're called English Letters.
04-08-2018T03:17:57,Bgrmystr2,"no dadro, japanese characters, not letters"
04-08-2018T03:18:15,Dadrobit,"The Japanese Hirigana Alphabet has around 60 something letters, but it's still just an alphabet."
04-08-2018T03:18:44,Dadrobit,They even sing it like a song like you and I would sing our ABC's.
04-08-2018T03:19:43,Bgrmystr2,doesn't change anything though. that's not a primary written language source
04-08-2018T03:20:44,Dadrobit,It's literally the very first thing Japanese people learn how to read and write in.
04-08-2018T03:21:17,Dadrobit,It's pretty friggin primary.
04-08-2018T03:22:26,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, did you miss the point where I said they use sounds? That's their source. The English Alphabet uses letters as a source and attaches sounds to them. Japanese does not. It uses sounds and attaches characters and letters to those sounds"
04-08-2018T03:22:41,Bgrmystr2,it's fundamentally different
04-08-2018T03:23:34,Bgrmystr2,"there's a reason we have 26 letters for the entire language and they have what, tens of thousands of characters? Maybe dozens of thousands"
04-08-2018T03:23:45,Dadrobit,"No, they have 65"
04-08-2018T03:23:51,Dadrobit,Written in 2 ways
04-08-2018T03:24:01,Dadrobit,Hirigana and Katakana
04-08-2018T03:24:24,Bgrmystr2,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_writing_system ""The total number of kanji is well over 50,000"""
04-08-2018T03:24:26,Bgrmystr2,Dozens of thousands
04-08-2018T03:24:49,Dadrobit,"Yes, that's Kanji."
04-08-2018T03:24:56,Bgrmystr2,and that's what I'm talkin about
04-08-2018T03:25:11,Dadrobit,"Not Hirigana or Katakana, which are the alphabets that they use."
04-08-2018T03:25:58,Bgrmystr2,Yeah to attach to the sounds. They don't need either one
04-08-2018T03:26:21,Dadrobit,"No, they 100% need them. Kanji is not all encompassing."
04-08-2018T03:27:18,Bgrmystr2,"Noone in japan needs the letter A, they already have every sound it can make in their language"
04-08-2018T03:27:25,Bgrmystr2,nor any letter in the english language
04-08-2018T03:27:33,Bgrmystr2,they have everything they need
04-08-2018T03:27:57,Dadrobit,„ÅÇ = A
04-08-2018T03:28:24,Bgrmystr2,"The former is a character, the latter is a letter."
04-08-2018T03:28:28,Bgrmystr2,they don't need the latter
04-08-2018T03:28:28,Dadrobit,"Yes, they have everything they need within the 60 some odd letters"
04-08-2018T03:28:37,Dadrobit,"A is just a ""character"""
04-08-2018T03:28:47,Dadrobit,They are synonomous.
04-08-2018T03:28:51,Bgrmystr2,There's a difference between characters and letters
04-08-2018T03:29:09,Bgrmystr2,"but I guess if you don't differenciate, then I can see where you're coming from"
04-08-2018T03:29:31,Dadrobit,Kanji are characters. Hirigana and Katakana are letters. How do you not understand this???
04-08-2018T03:30:08,Bgrmystr2,Lol I'm the one who doesn't understand xD
04-08-2018T03:30:15,Dadrobit,"Just because they have more than you're used to and you're not familiar with them, does not somehow change them into ""moon runes"""
04-08-2018T03:30:36,Bgrmystr2,you do realize the term moon runes is a running gag right
04-08-2018T03:30:53,Bgrmystr2,existed for a long time
04-08-2018T03:32:51,Bgrmystr2,"just like ""moonspeak"" of the vocal variety"
04-08-2018T03:34:44,Bgrmystr2,"also, the whole idea of them having so many than I am unfamiliar with is what makes them fall under the ""moonrune"" wordplay"
04-08-2018T03:34:48,Bgrmystr2,xD
04-08-2018T03:34:53,Bgrmystr2,kinda the whole point
04-08-2018T03:35:25,Bgrmystr2,"was just using it as a general thing, not specific"
04-08-2018T11:45:44,RimaDraws,o.o
04-08-2018T11:47:24,BadFoMo,Hmm?
04-08-2018T13:06:14,TorqueEmUp,Well how has everyone's day been so far?
04-08-2018T13:07:14,RimaDraws,okay so far
04-08-2018T13:07:18,RimaDraws,the raffle thing is new
04-08-2018T13:09:59,TheBeckoner,He's done it before. Not sure what that one was for though.
04-08-2018T13:11:31,TorqueEmUp,Raffle thing?
04-08-2018T13:11:54,RimaDraws,^ at the top
04-08-2018T13:14:26,TorqueEmUp,"Top of where, the stream page? I see nothing."
04-08-2018T13:18:43,TheBeckoner,If you recently loaded in it probably isnt there. Im thinking its only there if you were logged in when he did it.
04-08-2018T13:19:50,TorqueEmUp,That.... Doesn't make a lick of sense
04-08-2018T13:20:01,TorqueEmUp,Are you saying I need to clear my cache?
04-08-2018T13:20:22,TorqueEmUp,"Or is it just an option that breifly popped up, and then was removed?"
04-08-2018T13:20:39,TorqueEmUp,and only the people who haven't reloaded the page can see it?
04-08-2018T13:23:45,TorqueEmUp,Well whatever. It isn't important. :P
04-08-2018T13:28:51,TheBeckoner,I mean if you reload the page it wont be there when it loads back.
04-08-2018T13:29:47,Xexanoth,"last time he did a raffle he simply wanted to check if people were actually watching or afk, as only a handfull of the viewers are actually active in chat"
04-08-2018T13:30:05,Xexanoth,also i don't see any raffle so meh
04-08-2018T13:32:21,Xexanoth,ok...

04-08-2018T13:56:37,SpazztasticKiwi,But cool - another one. Maybe this means he got tech progress
04-08-2018T13:57:27,kylemeta,what if i have it in a another tab
04-08-2018T13:57:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"Sometimes it logs me out and I‚Äôm still there watching, but haven‚Äôt realized it‚Äôs kicked me out"
04-08-2018T13:58:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Does that when I‚Äôm idol too long
04-08-2018T14:01:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"But besides that, anything else going on for y‚Äôall"

04-08-2018T14:46:33,Twokinds,I bought a new SSD and replaced the main drive with a new install of windows
04-08-2018T14:46:50,Twokinds,That fixed the problem.
04-08-2018T14:47:06,Wooffin,And get some coffee too

04-08-2018T16:13:39,Afallingtree,Don‚Äôt play lotto even if you have the money for it
04-08-2018T16:13:45,Bgrmystr2,extra money can be put to better use than flushing it down the drain
04-08-2018T16:13:53,Bgrmystr2,the odds will never be in your favor
04-08-2018T16:13:57,BluePhantom90,heh Knew it! Flora and Trace go hunting for their dinner which is their date
04-08-2018T16:14:00,Umbreon07,Those 1s and 5s can seriously add up

04-08-2018T16:14:56,Raiteri,you have much higher odds of dying on your way to buy the lottery ticket than to win the grand prize

04-08-2018T16:15:33,unsteddyphoenix,but with SOULS
04-08-2018T16:15:33,ThingsAreMoving,for some money

04-08-2018T16:15:37,CrRAR,xD
04-08-2018T16:15:38,ThePurpleKitty,no gambling with your life ;)
04-08-2018T16:15:41,Xexanoth,the problem with lotto is that it's really stupid...unless you win
04-08-2018T16:15:46,RimaDraws,it is
04-08-2018T16:15:57,Afallingtree,And you never win so..
04-08-2018T16:16:00,Bgrmystr2,"nooo phoenix, if you gamble both souls, you'll die"
04-08-2018T16:16:01,ThingsAreMoving,"Wait, I heard you can donate blood for money in the US"
04-08-2018T16:16:08,ThingsAreMoving,that true?
04-08-2018T16:16:10,Umbreon07,Even when you win there's trouble. It's a hard life to have that much money and not know how to deal with it
04-08-2018T16:16:11,Ordithus,Plasma
04-08-2018T16:16:12,ferociousfox,plasma
04-08-2018T16:16:17,ThingsAreMoving,just plasma?
04-08-2018T16:16:21,SpazztasticKiwi,In some places but it‚Äôs plasma
04-08-2018T16:16:22,Afallingtree,Ye
04-08-2018T16:16:27,Bgrmystr2,yeah it's not a lot of money
04-08-2018T16:16:28,Umbreon07,"Leeches, hard spending, lack of faith for friends/family."
04-08-2018T16:16:30,RimaDraws,plasma
04-08-2018T16:16:30,Ordithus,You can also take part in medical trials!
04-08-2018T16:16:33,Bgrmystr2,but it is money
04-08-2018T16:16:35,Umbreon07,It's hard and not many can handle the stress
04-08-2018T16:16:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt deal with needles
04-08-2018T16:16:49,ferociousfox,not worth it
04-08-2018T16:16:50,Umbreon07,"Aim for where you are comfortable, but not rich"
04-08-2018T16:16:50,NightMeaty22,By the time you win you have spent as much money as jackpot
04-08-2018T16:16:55,ThingsAreMoving,I used to donate blood before I migrated to UK
04-08-2018T16:16:59,JamesBSquirrel3,Agree Bgr

04-08-2018T16:17:09,LannAF,Fucking fantastic idea
04-08-2018T16:17:11,LannAF,I used to do that.
04-08-2018T16:17:15,LannAF,Whoever said that thank you &lt;3
04-08-2018T16:17:19,ThingsAreMoving,&lt;3

04-08-2018T16:17:33,LannAF,She's never been out of the country
04-08-2018T16:17:35,DarthKeidran,I‚Äôm assuming this is the Trace and Flora on a date sketch?
04-08-2018T16:17:40,Ordithus,it is
04-08-2018T16:17:41,TorqueEmUp,"I used to as well, but I'd only do it if you really are desperate."
04-08-2018T16:17:43,LannAF,And we're gonna be staying at the new house me and my family have out there.
04-08-2018T16:17:44,Xexanoth,aye
04-08-2018T16:17:54,JamesBSquirrel3,[sigh] whatever you want if it is your wish
04-08-2018T16:18:03,TorqueEmUp,"Especially your first time there, expect to be there for many many hours."
04-08-2018T16:18:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Damn dude you want a new sister?
04-08-2018T16:18:07,ThingsAreMoving,"Good luck Lann, happy to help with the suggestion"
04-08-2018T16:18:10,LannAF,"Nah, I've done it plenty."
04-08-2018T16:18:16,BadFoMo,Flora had a Tiger suit too?
04-08-2018T16:18:27,Ordithus,"These streams are fun.  At the start, Tom said ""I have no idea"" then, this magic happens"
04-08-2018T16:18:27,TerraTheWizard,tiger birthday suit
04-08-2018T16:18:31,ThePurpleKitty,i need to get back into donating plasma. used to do it and have to say the extra 200$ or so a month really helped... either that or it was 200 every week or two. been a while like i said XD
04-08-2018T16:18:32,LannAF,are you asking me Kiwi?
04-08-2018T16:18:41,LannAF,if you're not as obnoxious as my current ones then yes.
04-08-2018T16:18:52,LannAF,the house is by the ocean too
04-08-2018T16:18:52,JamesBSquirrel3,Hey Tom! Looks as though your almost 1st done to me.
04-08-2018T16:18:58,MrEase,rip my computer crashed
04-08-2018T16:19:00,BluePhantom90,"Flora has that ""You ready to strike!"""
04-08-2018T16:19:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Well I‚Äôm not under 18 so that may be a plus
04-08-2018T16:19:14,MrEase,hoping my commission backup isn't too far back
04-08-2018T16:19:25,SpazztasticKiwi,So not annoying as most
04-08-2018T16:19:26,LannAF,I'm gonna go on ahead and not look into that comment
04-08-2018T16:19:28,LannAF,oh okay phew
04-08-2018T16:19:31,Ordithus,haha

04-08-2018T16:19:43,LannAF,they're obnoxious as fuck
04-08-2018T16:19:43,Vexd,Death to the computer
04-08-2018T16:19:45,TorqueEmUp,Also I've heard if you donate plasma too much tetnus shots stop working. I dunno how much truth there is to that.
04-08-2018T16:19:52,ThingsAreMoving,Flota is a hopeless romantic
04-08-2018T16:19:53,CrRAR,awwww

04-08-2018T16:20:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I realize now how bad that sounded at first so I added to it
04-08-2018T16:20:07,LannAF,LOL
04-08-2018T16:20:14,NightMeaty22,That moment you have a migraine and cant sleep so you take an excedrin then realise that it is pure caffeine and cant sleep any way
04-08-2018T16:20:16,LannAF,Awww
04-08-2018T16:20:18,LannAF,Lovely sketch

04-08-2018T16:20:38,unsteddyphoenix,Relationship goals tbh
04-08-2018T16:20:39,Bgrmystr2,but still
04-08-2018T16:20:41,LannAF,My only problem with plasma donation is the fact I kept doing it right the same arm
04-08-2018T16:20:47,LannAF,and it wouldn't heal
04-08-2018T16:20:54,LannAF,they said you can scar it like that
04-08-2018T16:21:01,LannAF,So I gave it a rest
04-08-2018T16:21:04,ThingsAreMoving,"Trace: ""But I don't want the deer's heart. I want yours, dear!"""

04-08-2018T16:21:38,TorqueEmUp,I also don't care to do it since the closest place that does that is like 30min away.
04-08-2018T16:21:44,JamesBSquirrel3,re-size Trace eh?
04-08-2018T16:21:46,unsteddyphoenix,"Not the deers dear heart, my dears dear heart!"

04-08-2018T16:21:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Didn‚Äôt the Aztecs only use virgins though
04-08-2018T16:22:01,BluePhantom90,lol
04-08-2018T16:22:12,Umbreon07,"No, mainly prisoners of war"
04-08-2018T16:22:13,BadFoMo,Wat?
04-08-2018T16:22:14,Twokinds,You get paid to donate plasma?
04-08-2018T16:22:17,ThingsAreMoving,yes
04-08-2018T16:22:19,TorqueEmUp,Yup

04-08-2018T16:22:29,ThePurpleKitty,"oh god, ""first one to take it down gets the heart"" what a date XD"

04-08-2018T16:22:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lucky
04-08-2018T16:22:44,CrRAR,haha
04-08-2018T16:22:45,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs blood donation
04-08-2018T16:22:47,TerraTheWizard,cookie is good money
04-08-2018T16:22:47,LannAF,"Yeah Tom, with my body weight I get about 47$ per donation"
04-08-2018T16:22:48,Ordithus,Cookie &gt; money
04-08-2018T16:22:48,Tharkis,they didnt let me donate blood the last few times i tried
04-08-2018T16:22:49,DarthKeidran,Are we on the second sketch or still the first?
04-08-2018T16:22:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I want a cookie
04-08-2018T16:22:53,unsteddyphoenix,expensive cookie
04-08-2018T16:23:00,Bgrmystr2,"to be honest, the money you get donating plasma would have bought you the cookie anyway"
04-08-2018T16:23:02,Bgrmystr2,so I mean..
04-08-2018T16:23:02,LannAF,47$ can buy you many cookies.
04-08-2018T16:23:02,Twokinds,No it was plasma
04-08-2018T16:23:06,Tharkis,because i'd eaten organ meats (haggis in this case) while traveling in the UK they said i wasnt allowed to donate
04-08-2018T16:23:11,Twokinds,But it was just a donation. I didn't get paid for it.
04-08-2018T16:23:12,MallardDuckAvia,What do you mean by plasma?
04-08-2018T16:23:15,LannAF,haha
04-08-2018T16:23:20,ThingsAreMoving,"Lann, but you can donate plasma every 2-3 weeks, yes?"
04-08-2018T16:23:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Went to the wrong vender. Shame
04-08-2018T16:23:21,TorqueEmUp,"Hmmm, you got jip'd"
04-08-2018T16:23:22,Bgrmystr2,"it's the liquid part of the blood, Mallard"
04-08-2018T16:23:27,LannAF,"2 times a week, Things."
04-08-2018T16:23:27,MallardDuckAvia,Ok
04-08-2018T16:23:33,LannAF,So you can make 100$ a week doing it.
04-08-2018T16:23:34,ThingsAreMoving,2 times a week?
04-08-2018T16:23:36,ThingsAreMoving,oof
04-08-2018T16:23:36,LannAF,Yup.
04-08-2018T16:23:41,Twokinds,I was just doing it because the hospital needed it.
04-08-2018T16:23:43,LannAF,My only concern is scar tissue.
04-08-2018T16:23:49,LannAF,I did it because money
04-08-2018T16:23:53,ThingsAreMoving,in my country there are limits on donating
04-08-2018T16:23:54,Tharkis,"yeah that's why i always donated blood too, Tom"
04-08-2018T16:23:56,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs a nice gesture. Good for you
04-08-2018T16:23:58,LannAF,You can see the two types of people in the world.
04-08-2018T16:23:58,TorqueEmUp,"True, nothing wrong with that."
04-08-2018T16:24:05,ThePurpleKitty,"@Twokinds well it depends on where you go, some places will pay you and some won't. most places pay tho so its always good to check into it before hand if your looking to make extra money from it"
04-08-2018T16:24:05,SpazztasticKiwi,My only problem is needles
04-08-2018T16:24:06,Tharkis,would always do the red cross blood drive near me
04-08-2018T16:24:07,LannAF,those who are nice to those in need
04-08-2018T16:24:08,Afallingtree,Where I live plasma donation is non profit
04-08-2018T16:24:08,Raiteri,Tharkis that is probably because you can increase your blood toxin levels from eating liver. It needs some time for your own liver to filter it out
04-08-2018T16:24:09,LannAF,AND THOSE IN NEED
04-08-2018T16:24:10,RimaDraws,ive never done it but probably wont
04-08-2018T16:24:10,ThingsAreMoving,also they're not paying. you get 8bars of chocolate
04-08-2018T16:24:17,SpazztasticKiwi,If there weren‚Äôt needles I‚Äôd do it
04-08-2018T16:24:17,Tharkis,"no, Raiteri"
04-08-2018T16:24:21,ferociousfox,Still considred donating if you're getting paid?
04-08-2018T16:24:24,Raiteri,no?
04-08-2018T16:24:24,CrRAR,CHOCOLATE
04-08-2018T16:24:27,Tharkis,it's because of some rule they put in place because of mad cow disease scare
04-08-2018T16:24:33,DarthKeidran,"Funny enough, at church they‚Äôre talking about an upcoming blood drive."
04-08-2018T16:24:37,Raiteri,ahhh... that makes more sense
04-08-2018T16:24:38,Tharkis,people who eat organ meat in the UK are inelliglble to donate blood in the USA currently
04-08-2018T16:24:47,JamesBSquirrel3,Everytime we get do these work to donate plasma
04-08-2018T16:24:49,CrRAR,what prudes
04-08-2018T16:24:50,ThePurpleKitty,well i'
04-08-2018T16:24:51,Raiteri,"well, thanks for explanation"
04-08-2018T16:24:55,ThePurpleKitty,... oops
04-08-2018T16:24:58,ThingsAreMoving,I usually donated red cells. Damn that was a long process.
04-08-2018T16:25:01,Raiteri,i forgot it existed
04-08-2018T16:25:03,TorqueEmUp,"Last time I was donating plasma, the glass bowl in the machine that spins to seperate the plasma from the blood shattered inside the machine when it was operating."
04-08-2018T16:25:09,Bgrmystr2,"I can imagine, things"
04-08-2018T16:25:10,LannAF,that's spooky.

04-08-2018T16:26:05,LannAF,hahaha
04-08-2018T16:26:06,Bgrmystr2,that kinda shit is why I keep my blood inside me

04-08-2018T18:05:43,BluePhantom90,Wonder if the Snow Wolfs and Snow Leopards got along. I mean they both love Snow....
04-08-2018T18:05:52,Bgrmystr2,you can't be perfectly resistant to something that heals you.. healing in itself means it affects you :P
04-08-2018T18:05:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Should I go ahead and suggest or is it closed
04-08-2018T18:06:05,Ordithus,They probably fought wars over the best snow

04-08-2018T18:06:33,MuonNeutrino,@SpazztasticKiwi the suggestions are submitted on tom's patreon a day or two in advance

04-08-2018T18:07:09,ThingsAreMoving,"nah, it heals you but a lot less effective"

04-08-2018T18:07:18,Bgrmystr2,then it's not zombify

04-08-2018T18:07:33,Bgrmystr2,and is a debuff

04-08-2018T21:01:54,Combak,"Aw, so close on the car wash."
04-08-2018T21:01:55,CrRAR,xD
04-08-2018T21:01:58,FenceEqualizer,Was expecting the car wash to win by a landside
04-08-2018T21:01:58,Twokinds,Hm...
04-08-2018T21:02:07,HobbitGames,The results arent showing for me

04-08-2018T21:02:30,CrimsonHelsing,I voted modern flora and trace
04-08-2018T21:02:36,Combak,"It's the reality vs expectation thing again, but for Reality, Natani is still wearing clothes."
04-08-2018T21:02:37,Ordithus,Expectation: wet dog; Reality: dry suit?
04-08-2018T21:02:40,JamesBSquirrel3,7) Natani's Shower: Expectation vs Reality. Reality featuring her being fully clothed the one time she shouldnt be. Eh?
04-08-2018T21:02:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"might be too sexy Unsteddy, remember.  Gay in moderation"
04-08-2018T21:02:51,unsteddyphoenix,Lol gotta pace out the gay
04-08-2018T21:03:10,ProsePro7,Just have expectations be really sexy and Im good
04-08-2018T21:03:15,Ordithus,"Hmm... with Nat, the expectation is gotta be hot as hell"
04-08-2018T21:03:20,HobbitGames,Jesus it's hot!
04-08-2018T21:03:24,Dadrobit,Everything should be done in moderation. Even moderation. You should always have a vice or two to do in excess! :D
04-08-2018T21:03:35,Dadrobit,"Also, Howdy y'all!"
04-08-2018T21:03:38,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, this is a weird request.  Even Tom said so!"

04-08-2018T21:04:41,Combak,But DID we get anything vaguely gay this stream?

04-08-2018T21:04:58,Dadrobit,"Patreon is still being a butt. They won't let me log in on my computer. Got in on my phone, but attempting to log in on the desktop locks me out of my account again..."
04-08-2018T21:04:59,totallynotTrace,no just things that would turn you gay
04-08-2018T21:04:59,HobbitGames,Keith in shower maybe?
04-08-2018T21:05:06,Ordithus,"Not really ""vague"" per se"

04-08-2018T21:07:54,Ordithus,I do it all the time
04-08-2018T21:08:01,ElvenHunter84,I was wondering if a redraw of this would be too lewd
04-08-2018T21:08:14,Combak,"Heresy, you mean like the Never-Nude scene?"
04-08-2018T21:08:22,HobbitGames,"Will all of these be posted somewhere, or are they to be lost to antiquity"

04-08-2018T21:08:24,JamesBSquirrel3,"Unfortunally it's too close to call that - Come on down to Alaric's (sexy) car-wash, in 1 point."
04-08-2018T21:08:44,Ordithus,"They are posted to Tom's Patreon, Hobit"
04-08-2018T21:08:51,Ordithus,*Hobbit
04-08-2018T21:08:51,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. it already exists elven
04-08-2018T21:08:55,HobbitGames,All of them though?
04-08-2018T21:09:04,Bgrmystr2,not sure why a re-draw would be a problem
04-08-2018T21:09:06,TheBeckoner,I see we have more shower shenanigans...
04-08-2018T21:09:09,Bgrmystr2,but not sure why it's needed either
04-08-2018T21:09:16,totallynotTrace,wow. that is a very seggestive popsicle
04-08-2018T21:09:18,Ordithus,"Yes, and things that have to go ""Patron only"" are on his deviantart as well"
04-08-2018T21:09:26,ElvenHunter84,I'd like to see it in his new style. There are tons of suggestions for redraws of old things
04-08-2018T21:09:31,BadFoMo,Oh! For 'reality' would Natani have gotten in the shower like Wodworth did in Clue?
04-08-2018T21:09:38,HobbitGames,Thanks
04-08-2018T21:09:41,ElvenHunter84,but idk if it'd be TOO suggestive with the current style
04-08-2018T21:09:51,ElvenHunter84,that's all
04-08-2018T21:10:39,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
04-08-2018T21:10:40,TorqueEmUp,Ehh I personally don't think so.
04-08-2018T21:10:44,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah it's pretty unlikely
04-08-2018T21:10:51,unsteddyphoenix,Or he'd spin it some different way
04-08-2018T21:11:08,TorqueEmUp,But he already did do a sequel sketch. He did it as a doodgle.
04-08-2018T21:11:12,HobbitGames,"Hey, how come the only place I could find a link to this stream page is through some old notification posts on Patreon? Is it posted anyehere else that hes gonna be streaming?"

04-08-2018T21:12:38,TorqueEmUp,Well probably about as close to a sequel as we will get.
04-08-2018T21:12:40,SavisErren,"I second BadFoMo's suggestion, that got a solid laugh outta me"
04-08-2018T21:12:46,HobbitGames,"Yeah, I am following him, its just I had to search for ages through some forum posts, and then I realised there were links on his patreon."

04-08-2018T23:15:37,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm gonna cook him
04-08-2018T23:15:59,SpazztasticKiwi,(I want to make a joke here but it might be offensive)
04-08-2018T23:16:03,unsteddyphoenix,"*she says, hiding her knives behind her back*"
04-08-2018T23:16:54,Dadrobit,"""On an unrelated note, I need to go turn off my grill"" -Spazz maybe."
04-08-2018T23:17:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Nah I‚Äôm gonna keep my original quip to myself
04-08-2018T23:18:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Besides I got ice cream
04-08-2018T23:19:49,SpazztasticKiwi,And I‚Äôm watching saw
04-08-2018T23:22:55,FenceEqualizer,Nothing makes ice cream better then watching elaborate traps.
04-08-2018T23:22:56,goldgardian,is tom here answering lore questions again?
04-08-2018T23:23:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm trying to figure out where I‚Äôve seen this actor before
04-08-2018T23:25:49,SpazztasticKiwi,And I‚Äôve been thinking of some lore questions too but he may have gone for dinner
04-08-2018T23:25:54,FennexTheFox,oh hey mine got picked
04-08-2018T23:26:00,FennexTheFox,just now saw the stream lol
04-08-2018T23:26:39,FennexTheFox,i need to start getting here on time
04-08-2018T23:27:01,ElvenHunter84,"Mine got shot down, lol. Time to go back to the wholesome suggestions, I guess"
04-08-2018T23:27:17,Dadrobit,What was yours?
04-08-2018T23:27:52,FennexTheFox,the keidran date
04-08-2018T23:28:03,FennexTheFox,i wasnt expecting B U T T
04-08-2018T23:28:14,Dadrobit,"Ah, was asking Elven."
04-08-2018T23:28:23,FennexTheFox,"ah yeah elven, what was yours?"
04-08-2018T23:28:33,SpazztasticKiwi,This is Tom. There will be butt
04-08-2018T23:28:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Or boob. No in between
04-08-2018T23:28:53,ElvenHunter84,"It was quite lewd, so I'd rather not say it out loud"
04-08-2018T23:29:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Technically you‚Äôd be typing it
04-08-2018T23:29:09,ElvenHunter84,Ask Unstedddy if you really want to know
04-08-2018T23:29:19,Dadrobit,"Jesus, what, Kat giving Zen head?"
04-08-2018T23:29:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Oooookaaaay
04-08-2018T23:29:37,ElvenHunter84,"No, nothing that lewd lol"
04-08-2018T23:29:44,unsteddyphoenix,That is my least favourite thing youve ever said
04-08-2018T23:29:47,Dadrobit,lol
04-08-2018T23:29:50,unsteddyphoenix,*so far*
04-08-2018T23:29:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Agreed
04-08-2018T23:30:03,Dadrobit,LMFAO
04-08-2018T23:30:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,thats like a super nope for me
04-08-2018T23:30:53,Dadrobit,"I mean, the obvious ""worse than even that"" scenario is Zen giving Kat head. So you can have that for free."
04-08-2018T23:31:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,how about no one gives head
04-08-2018T23:31:20,Dadrobit,"Hey man, Elven started it."
04-08-2018T23:31:41,FennexTheFox,how does tom draw such cute characters
04-08-2018T23:31:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Then I'll blmae him when I see him
04-08-2018T23:31:48,FennexTheFox,like he makes it look easy
04-08-2018T23:31:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,14 years of practice
04-08-2018T23:32:01,Dadrobit,A decade and a half of practice
04-08-2018T23:32:06,Dadrobit,Ty Marv.
04-08-2018T23:32:10,FennexTheFox,damn
04-08-2018T23:32:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,o7
04-08-2018T23:32:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I find people draw what they feel is ideal
04-08-2018T23:32:31,SpazztasticKiwi,So Tom maybe finds cute ideal
04-08-2018T23:32:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,don't we all :)
04-08-2018T23:33:02,FennexTheFox,"im an art student. most of what i draw is furry stuff, i try to draw stuff but what i envision in my head is not what appears on the paper"
04-08-2018T23:33:20,TorqueEmUp,Agreed Spazz
04-08-2018T23:34:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"That takes time to get to Fox, but I find the best things to do when something isn't going right is to meme it"
04-08-2018T23:34:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚ÄúIf you want to learn what he couldn‚Äôt stand to lose, look at what he photographs‚Äù"
04-08-2018T23:34:27,Dadrobit,Was getting some advice from folks the other night on where I'm at in art. Considering picking up a tablet to join in on the digital funsies.
04-08-2018T23:37:18,unsteddyphoenix,Digital is so much better imo
04-08-2018T23:37:26,FennexTheFox,"im not a tablet person, robit. can't deal with not being able to look down and see what im drawing"
04-08-2018T23:37:31,unsteddyphoenix,I Really disliked using paper
04-08-2018T23:37:38,unsteddyphoenix,It's so cumbersome and INCONVINIENT
04-08-2018T23:37:49,FennexTheFox,i just use touchscreen with a digital pen
04-08-2018T23:37:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,tablets is the way to go imo
04-08-2018T23:38:03,Dadrobit,:( But mah sketchbooks...
04-08-2018T23:38:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,no eraser dust in ya bed
04-08-2018T23:38:45,unsteddyphoenix,Burn them for warmth
04-08-2018T23:39:13,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I wanted to maybe put down a couple bucks on an inexpensive tablet and at least try it and see how well what I have translates."
04-08-2018T23:40:20,unsteddyphoenix,It didnt take that long to transition for me personally
04-08-2018T23:42:03,FenceEqualizer,Tablets are just a weird thing to transit to. Don't think paper and pencil will ever go away.
04-08-2018T23:45:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"a screen tablet, its almost like a minute before you're used to it I feel"
04-08-2018T23:46:11,Dadrobit,Sure. But that's a screen tablet.
04-08-2018T23:46:13,FenceEqualizer,Yeah but those are expensive for a good one
04-08-2018T23:46:22,Dadrobit,And I don't make that kind of money
04-08-2018T23:46:24,Dadrobit,yet!
04-08-2018T23:46:41,FenceEqualizer,Save that money!
04-08-2018T23:46:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Parblo coast 10 is pretty cheep and a decent little tablet
04-08-2018T23:47:12,Dadrobit,Fifty or Sixty bucks is whatever to spend on a hobby. But Screen Tablets tend to add a rather unfortunate zero to those figures.
04-08-2018T23:47:46,FenceEqualizer,200
04-08-2018T23:47:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"yeah but for the most part, its a one time buy then you just have it for as long as you keep care of it"
04-08-2018T23:48:48,FenceEqualizer,"Think of it like an investment for you future art,voicing acting career"
04-08-2018T23:50:22,Dadrobit,24% (almost a full quarter of all reviews) gave that a 1 star.
04-08-2018T23:50:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Mine still works after 4 years of owning it
04-08-2018T23:51:29,Dadrobit,"I don't mind up front investments, (How many thousands have I spent on audio gear???) but I do want some level of QA..."
04-08-2018T23:52:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:thinking:
04-08-2018T23:52:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Maybe something from XP-pen?
04-08-2018T23:52:40,unsteddyphoenix,Just buy a screenless tablet and suck it up
04-08-2018T23:52:43,unsteddyphoenix,That's what I did~
04-08-2018T23:53:10,Dadrobit,"Yeah, that's why I was looking at different more inexpensive screenless variants."
04-08-2018T23:53:11,unsteddyphoenix,It's honestly not that bad. We're all amatuers so how much does it change really
04-08-2018T23:53:43,unsteddyphoenix,:ok_hand:
04-08-2018T23:53:43,Dadrobit,Looking at one verified purchase of the Parblo that said his caught on fire? GG
04-08-2018T23:53:51,unsteddyphoenix,Loool
04-08-2018T23:53:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
04-08-2018T23:53:57,unsteddyphoenix,His art was just THAT HOT
04-08-2018T23:53:57,Dadrobit,"Yaeh, exactly."
04-08-2018T23:54:02,Ordithus,:fire: makes for excitement!
04-08-2018T23:54:28,Dadrobit,"I'm not looking to make it as a big time artist, but everyone seems to have so much fun with digital."
04-08-2018T23:54:47,Dadrobit,And taking pictures with my phone to share is cumbersome.
04-08-2018T23:56:09,unsteddyphoenix,It is!
04-08-2018T23:56:41,unsteddyphoenix,to both
04-08-2018T23:57:11,Dadrobit,"Granted, faffing about with drivers seems to be rather gnarly as well."
04-08-2018T23:57:38,FenceEqualizer,And Tom has had his share of fighting with his drivers.
04-08-2018T23:58:19,Ordithus,"Lemee tell ya, getting the drivers on a Surface to work was a paaaaain"
04-08-2018T23:59:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Huion driver were super easy to install
