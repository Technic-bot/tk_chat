14-03-2018T00:00:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Nibbly is like, ""man the last time I teleported I got weird black stuff on me"""
14-03-2018T00:00:29,Vatruvius,Yes Kiwi! :D
14-03-2018T00:00:30,McClaw,Or maybe she realizes that if she goes through the gate her secret will be revealed? :P
14-03-2018T00:00:34,Bgrmystr2,Cuz maren doesn't like Nibbly? She's said so
14-03-2018T00:00:46,unsteddyphoenix,Maren is a big bully :/

14-03-2018T00:00:52,Bgrmystr2,it's obvious Nibbly would catch onto that really easy

14-03-2018T00:01:18,Vatruvius,Maren looks jealous of either Raine getting Mrs. Nibbly or Raine looking like that in her human form.

14-03-2018T00:27:28,unsteddyphoenix,IT WAS A FREEFALL REFERENCE THE WHOLE TIME AAAAAA
14-03-2018T00:28:45,Bgrmystr2,LOL

14-03-2018T00:31:56,Bgrmystr2,xD Righttt
14-03-2018T00:32:12,Bgrmystr2,"after reading Freefall, I had re-read the comic"
14-03-2018T00:32:25,Bgrmystr2,"and I saw that and I ""eeeeeeee"" 'd"
14-03-2018T00:32:41,Bgrmystr2,I had a happy
14-03-2018T00:36:14,Twokinds,Yes
14-03-2018T00:36:30,Twokinds,I like that page
14-03-2018T00:37:48,Vatruvius,I should probably ask while you are still here Tom.
14-03-2018T00:38:19,unsteddyphoenix,Im going to have to re-read after im caught up with freefall too
14-03-2018T00:38:28,unsteddyphoenix,Im suspicious now
14-03-2018T00:38:29,Vatruvius,"When making sketch suggestions, if your suggestion does not get voted do you need to resubmit it for the following sketch stream or does it stay until it gets voted?"
14-03-2018T00:39:35,unsteddyphoenix,You need to resubmit
14-03-2018T00:39:53,Vatruvius,"Alright, thank you unsteddy"
14-03-2018T00:54:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"Oh, Tom - I dunno if you‚Äôre still on, but have you been feeling any better?"
14-03-2018T01:21:15,Twokinds,"Yeah, much better"
14-03-2018T01:24:27,thestooge,We're glad to hear that Tom!
14-03-2018T01:41:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Whoo üôåüèª
14-03-2018T01:42:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"Startin to think you‚Äôd gone to bed. But you still have to do important magic stuff for the page tonight, right?"
14-03-2018T01:46:14,unsteddyphoenix,why sleep its so early
14-03-2018T01:47:36,Vatruvius,"Did you really just say that unsteddy? I mean, technically it is early, but really?"
14-03-2018T01:50:38,Vatruvius,Well that is just annoying. There seems to be a particularly picky Dignity Health ad on keenspot forcing me to see the ad and not the comic until it has finished.
14-03-2018T02:00:10,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs 2 in the morning for me - 3 for him
14-03-2018T02:00:53,unsteddyphoenix,If you cant hear birds chirping it's not time for bed.
14-03-2018T02:01:04,Vatruvius,"It's midnight here so...yeah. I would not say ""why sleep."""
14-03-2018T02:01:06,DarthRexKing,Goodnight.
14-03-2018T02:01:10,Vatruvius,O...M...G
14-03-2018T02:02:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Actually we do have birds around here that sing at night - Whiporwills
14-03-2018T02:02:54,unsteddyphoenix,That sounds awful
14-03-2018T02:03:19,SpazztasticKiwi,*whipoorwills
14-03-2018T02:03:52,DarthRexKing,omg what? vat'
14-03-2018T02:04:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"*whippoorwills (welcome to the English language, where even autocorrect doesn‚Äôt know what the hell is going on)"
14-03-2018T02:04:25,Vatruvius,unsteddy's comment about it not being bedtime until birds chirp
14-03-2018T02:05:50,Vatruvius,"Since two of my keys on my keyboard do not work, I have been using auto correct to try and get them. You will not believe how many times auto correct thinks my word is something completely different when all it needs is this one letter I cannot type."
14-03-2018T02:06:12,Vatruvius,I have to go and pull up window's virtual keyboard to type it in every time.
14-03-2018T02:08:22,Vatruvius,"Dang it, I think I bruised myself scratching an itch. Wow...that hurts."
14-03-2018T02:10:02,Twokinds,You should have instead not done that
14-03-2018T02:10:24,Twokinds,"Captain Hindsight, awaaaay!"
14-03-2018T02:10:29,DarthRexKing,:P
14-03-2018T02:10:31,DarthRexKing,lol.
14-03-2018T02:10:46,DarthRexKing,"Anyway, good night people. Do not let the dancing nibbles bite."
14-03-2018T02:10:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Okay guys just hang in with me here. I have a story
14-03-2018T02:11:00,DarthRexKing,&gt;w&gt;
14-03-2018T02:11:22,SpazztasticKiwi,United Airlines had a family board their plane with their German Shepherd
14-03-2018T02:11:53,DarthRexKing,Uh oh.
14-03-2018T02:12:04,unsteddyphoenix,Ooo I heard about this
14-03-2018T02:12:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"When they landed after their flight, they go to pick up their ‚Äúdog‚Äù, and guess what they find (it‚Äôs not dead, NO SPOILERS)"
14-03-2018T02:12:57,SpazztasticKiwi,They got a Great Dane. And their dog accidentally got swapped with this Great Dane to a Japanese flight
14-03-2018T02:13:02,unsteddyphoenix,"Unlike that other dog, who WAS dead after the airline forced them to put it in the overhead compartment"
14-03-2018T02:13:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Do you watch Philip DeFranco too?
14-03-2018T02:13:51,Vatruvius,Hold up...dead dogs are no fun.
14-03-2018T02:13:57,unsteddyphoenix,"No, the news~"
14-03-2018T02:14:30,Vatruvius,"And Tom, you would be the best Captain Hindsight superhero ever."
14-03-2018T02:14:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"The family that ended up with their dog being killed, cause let‚Äôs face it, that attendant essentially killed that dog themselves"
14-03-2018T02:15:20,unsteddyphoenix,Really weird case
14-03-2018T02:15:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Was separate from the German Shepherd/Great Dane mix up
14-03-2018T02:15:35,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah that's just funny
14-03-2018T02:15:40,Vatruvius,"Coming to a theater near you, Tom Fischbach as Captain Hindsight."
14-03-2018T02:15:59,SpazztasticKiwi,These stories also aren‚Äôt helping my nerves on flying
14-03-2018T02:16:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I already don‚Äôt like heights
14-03-2018T02:16:21,unsteddyphoenix,Dont put your dogs in bags
14-03-2018T02:16:45,Vatruvius,"Statistically speaking, you are more likely to get struck by lighting then to have anything happen to you on a flight."
14-03-2018T02:16:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don‚Äôt have a dog personally - just the two cats and frog, and none are going with"
14-03-2018T02:17:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"But there‚Äôs the missing/mishandled bags, being dragged off a plane, and Mr. Touchy TSA agent stories"
14-03-2018T02:17:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Or Mrs. Touchy TSA agent
14-03-2018T02:18:06,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah the vid where the dude was dragged off a plane was messed up
14-03-2018T02:20:06,DarthRexKing,"Seriously, what the hell is up with united airlines? This isn't the same one that accidentally killed that giant rabbit then cremated it, was it?"
14-03-2018T02:20:16,Vatruvius,"Hmm...I have been on like 8 flights in the last year and none of them had anything like that in it. It was really simple, check in, scan, board, pack, and sit."
14-03-2018T02:20:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"Not looking forward to being in a giant metal tube going a few thousand mp/h at over 10,000 feet"
14-03-2018T02:21:01,SpazztasticKiwi,And what about that giant rabbitt
14-03-2018T02:21:07,Vatruvius,"If you think about the number of people flying every day, it is really unlikely anything will happen to on the plane or from the TSA."
14-03-2018T02:21:15,unsteddyphoenix,Just dont think too hard about how planes are totally impossible and the magic will keep working.
14-03-2018T02:22:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Possitive thinking. Brilliant
14-03-2018T02:22:32,DarthRexKing,"Ever heard of flemish rabbits? They are huge, about as big as a dog. A flemish giant named Simon was voted as biggest rabbit in the world. I cannot remember the details, but United Airlines accidentally killed him and without the owner's consent,"
14-03-2018T02:22:32,Vatruvius,"I can explain the science behind how they work right now unsteddy, do not temp me. It will be a full fledged physics course up in here."
14-03-2018T02:22:49,DarthRexKing,they cremated him. Fortunately Simon had other children I think bigger than him.
14-03-2018T02:22:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"United, what‚Äôs wrong with y‚Äôall"
14-03-2018T02:23:15,DarthRexKing,I know right.
14-03-2018T02:23:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you do, Vat, I‚Äôm going to bed. Had enough of that in high school"
14-03-2018T02:23:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Poor bun
14-03-2018T02:24:15,DarthRexKing,"Fortunately, Simon's legacy lives on in his children, like I said I think they beat their father in size. Google flemish giants."
14-03-2018T02:24:30,DarthRexKing,I should go too. Good luck with your flight. Wherever you're going.
14-03-2018T02:24:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I know about buns. Flemish buns are slightly terrifying
14-03-2018T02:25:07,Vatruvius,"Good luck, and the science is there unsteddy!"
14-03-2018T02:25:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôm just going to Boston. It‚Äôs an hour flight, or it should be"
14-03-2018T02:25:26,DarthRexKing,"Cool, and why are flemish giants scary to you? XD"
14-03-2018T02:25:37,unsteddyphoenix,Nah planes are magic earth is flat stay woke
14-03-2018T02:25:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Big bun = big bite
14-03-2018T02:25:53,Vatruvius,"That is not that bad, I was on a 3 hour flight followed by a 4 hour flight with a 2 hour waiting time inbetween."

14-03-2018T02:26:19,DarthRexKing,"Oh wait, it was not a flemish, it was a continental."
14-03-2018T02:26:28,DarthRexKing,I forgot about those.
14-03-2018T02:26:36,unsteddyphoenix,Ive been on 12-hour to 10-hour flights
14-03-2018T02:26:55,unsteddyphoenix,Its super not fun
14-03-2018T02:26:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Cute bun
14-03-2018T02:27:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"If I‚Äôd been meant to fly, I‚Äôd have been born with wings"

14-03-2018T02:28:14,unsteddyphoenix,"Wings that work, at least."
14-03-2018T02:28:16,Vatruvius,I would not expect flights that long to be fun. My 4 hour flight was bad enough.
14-03-2018T02:28:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Very big bun
14-03-2018T02:28:54,DarthRexKing,Yep.
14-03-2018T02:29:25,SpazztasticKiwi,My friend had a bunny she got as a birthday present for someone staying with her. It was smallish and had floof

14-03-2018T02:31:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Then I guess I‚Äôm not human
14-03-2018T02:31:33,DarthRexKing,"I agree with that, Unsteddy."
14-03-2018T02:31:33,unsteddyphoenix,"He says, in the chat of an art stream."
14-03-2018T02:31:54,Vatruvius,"Now wait just a minute, I have been a lot of fun at parties. Of course, I go to nerd parties so...take that with a grain of salt."
14-03-2018T02:32:02,unsteddyphoenix,But what does a cute romance comic ACCOMPLISH though.
14-03-2018T02:32:03,DarthRexKing,It is better to be practical than fun if the fun has no practicality to it.
14-03-2018T02:32:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"Basically all we do in these streams is watch a dot move around on a screen, leaving lines and color behind"
14-03-2018T02:32:37,DarthRexKing,"Unsteddy said you were fun at parties, vat."
14-03-2018T02:32:39,Vatruvius,There you go Darth
14-03-2018T02:32:49,DarthRexKing,go where?
14-03-2018T02:33:21,Vatruvius,Refering to your practical and fun joke
14-03-2018T02:34:40,Bgrmystr2,A lot of people here seem to not be fluent in the highly coveted ancient language of sarcasm.
14-03-2018T02:34:42,DarthRexKing,???
14-03-2018T02:34:43,Vatruvius,"But...at least this comic exercises the brain and the various emotions we can experience not to mention the interaction we have in this chat. But breading a giant rabbit? Sure, its cute, but nothing changes."
14-03-2018T02:35:08,Bgrmystr2,"Vatru, you literally have zero knowledge of why people keep pets, huh?"
14-03-2018T02:35:14,Vatruvius,My family is the royal family of sarcasm.
14-03-2018T02:35:15,DarthRexKing,What part did you think I was saying was a joke?
14-03-2018T02:35:20,SpazztasticKiwi,This comic causes more theorizing than I ever did for school
14-03-2018T02:35:31,Vatruvius,I have two dogs myself mystr
14-03-2018T02:35:36,DarthRexKing,vat?
14-03-2018T02:35:43,SpazztasticKiwi,And more interest too
14-03-2018T02:35:46,Bgrmystr2,Then you'd know your statement on the rabbits is pretty incorrect then
14-03-2018T02:35:50,Bgrmystr2,but yknow
14-03-2018T02:35:54,Bgrmystr2,you do you :v
14-03-2018T02:36:08,Vatruvius,"I just liked your comment Darth, a :thumbsup: from me."
14-03-2018T02:36:19,DarthRexKing,But wasn't telling a joke.
14-03-2018T02:36:30,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-keifacepalm:
14-03-2018T02:36:34,unsteddyphoenix,Quit while youre behind
14-03-2018T02:36:39,Bgrmystr2,but phoenix
14-03-2018T02:36:43,Bgrmystr2,I can't
14-03-2018T02:36:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Y‚Äôall thinking too hard again
14-03-2018T02:36:45,Vatruvius,"misspoke, meant to say phrase/sentence, anyway."
14-03-2018T02:37:19,unsteddyphoenix,Vat and Darth are like two chatbots talking to each other.
14-03-2018T02:37:24,Bgrmystr2,hahahaha
14-03-2018T02:37:26,Bgrmystr2,I can see it
14-03-2018T02:37:30,Bgrmystr2,100% yes
14-03-2018T02:37:43,DarthRexKing,Chatbots?
14-03-2018T02:37:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Simulacrum
14-03-2018T02:38:02,Vatruvius,"In a robot voice, ""I am a chat bot, I speak utter nonsense."""
14-03-2018T02:38:21,Bgrmystr2,Yes Vatru. And absolutely nothing would have changed. :D
14-03-2018T02:38:41,DarthRexKing,How are we chatbots?
14-03-2018T02:39:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I kind of want to pet a snow leopard
14-03-2018T02:39:49,Bgrmystr2,"I, too, rex, am not an AI, and an actual human that attempt at read human messages is fascinating."
14-03-2018T02:40:02,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-adiracoin::ctwokinds-maevecute:
14-03-2018T02:40:02,DarthRexKing,I hope it eats you. XD
14-03-2018T02:40:29,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs never been a case of a snow leopard attacking a human
14-03-2018T02:40:34,Vatruvius,"You can try, no guarantee you will keep your hand."
14-03-2018T02:40:37,DarthRexKing,"Unsteddy said vat and I are chatbots, not you. I don't see how when we are actually people talking."
14-03-2018T02:41:21,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah, you're right. At least the bots actually follow the conversation and happen to make sense out of it sometimes."
14-03-2018T02:41:40,DarthRexKing,"Marv is love, Marv is life.....or was it Mave....."
14-03-2018T02:41:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"And besides, I‚Äôve seen two up close in person. They‚Äôre not big cats at all, but they‚Äôre still something you keep your eyes on"
14-03-2018T02:41:43,Vatruvius,"Chatbots talk a lot basically. Fill up chat rooms with a lot of...well chat. Also, I spell check."
14-03-2018T02:41:47,Bgrmystr2,definitely different in that respect :thinking:
14-03-2018T02:41:58,Vatruvius,Meave
14-03-2018T02:42:18,DarthRexKing,That is what everyone does in chat. Chat a lot and fill up the chat room.
14-03-2018T02:42:38,DarthRexKing,Always the unique names I can barely remember.
14-03-2018T02:42:41,Vatruvius,"Everyone is a bot, an AI who thinks they are open!"
14-03-2018T02:42:49,Vatruvius,:ptv-shock:
14-03-2018T02:43:01,SpazztasticKiwi,How else are we supposed to communicate? Carrier pidgin?
14-03-2018T02:43:07,Vatruvius,human* thanks autocorrect
14-03-2018T02:43:11,DarthRexKing,"An A.I is artificial, we are alive so.....what is the difference between us and a chat bot anyway?"
14-03-2018T02:43:39,Vatruvius,"If you are an AI who thinks you are human, can you tell the difference?"
14-03-2018T02:43:56,SpazztasticKiwi,*pigeon
14-03-2018T02:44:19,DarthRexKing,"Since we do not have that level of technology yet, or....maybe on a small scale somewhere we don't know about yet or I don't know......I cannot answer that."
14-03-2018T02:45:26,Bgrmystr2,literally chatbots.
14-03-2018T02:45:29,Bgrmystr2,xD
14-03-2018T02:45:33,Bgrmystr2,I can't even describe
14-03-2018T02:45:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Well while I‚Äôll say my phone cane be smarter than me in that it uses the internet and ai to do as it does...
14-03-2018T02:45:51,DarthRexKing,And why the hell would a rabbit try to hump a chicken? Are they that damn horny?
14-03-2018T02:46:37,Vatruvius,"What if we were once part of an advanced civilization with a large AI populace that disappeared and we evolved into what we think is life. We no longer have the same technology as we once did, that does not mean we are not AI."
14-03-2018T02:46:39,SpazztasticKiwi,It also can‚Äôt be convinced to put the ‚Äús‚Äù in Fischbach unless I hand-correct it so much it sticks in my keyboard dictionary
14-03-2018T02:47:56,Vatruvius,I took German in high school so I can spell Tom's name. Woohoo!
14-03-2018T02:48:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm currently taking some lessons
14-03-2018T02:48:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn‚Äôt even know how to say it until Mark said it in one of his videos
14-03-2018T02:48:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Why are there 3 ways to say ‚Äúthe‚Äù
14-03-2018T02:49:54,Vatruvius,"Ah...yes. Mescaline, feminine, and neutral."
14-03-2018T02:50:05,Vatruvius,Isn't fun?
14-03-2018T02:50:19,Bgrmystr2,Masculine*?
14-03-2018T02:50:46,Vatruvius,"Spellcheck said it was fine, curse you spell check!"
14-03-2018T02:51:01,Bgrmystr2,Spell check has not a fuck of clue what you're trying to spell
14-03-2018T02:51:12,Bgrmystr2,only that what you are spelling is a word that is in it's database
14-03-2018T02:51:26,Bgrmystr2,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mescaline
14-03-2018T02:51:50,DarthRexKing,XD
14-03-2018T02:52:03,Bgrmystr2,it's basically similar to an LSD
14-03-2018T02:52:06,Bgrmystr2,so... yeah
14-03-2018T02:52:11,Bgrmystr2,gj on that one
14-03-2018T02:52:40,Vatruvius,"I know what spell check is mystr, and I can curse it all I want."
14-03-2018T02:52:53,Bgrmystr2,I'm not saying not to curse it
14-03-2018T02:53:08,Bgrmystr2,I'm just saying it's doing exactly what it's intended to do
14-03-2018T02:53:15,Vatruvius,I can still blame the human/humans that designed it with its faulty programming/database finding method.
14-03-2018T02:53:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Autocorrect has been hell on my spell checking for these lessons
14-03-2018T02:53:24,Bgrmystr2,"you can't really, vatru"
14-03-2018T02:53:27,Bgrmystr2,because that's not what it's for
14-03-2018T02:53:44,Bgrmystr2,"spellcheck is not, and was never intended to check to see what word you intended to use."
14-03-2018T02:53:58,Bgrmystr2,it has no way of knowing intention
14-03-2018T02:54:13,Bgrmystr2,it's just a program that checks for correct spelling and punctuation
14-03-2018T02:54:47,Bgrmystr2,"it will never tell you the proper usage of there, their, or they're."
14-03-2018T02:54:59,Bgrmystr2,but it will accept all three.
14-03-2018T02:55:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Social media proves that
14-03-2018T02:55:06,Bgrmystr2,because it only checks spelling.
14-03-2018T02:55:36,Vatruvius,"Agh...that is where you are wrong mystr. Spell check now, the newer ones that are coming out, actually check sentences and looks for context in choosing a word that fits it best."
14-03-2018T02:55:40,Bgrmystr2,"there's some grammar rules built-into spellcheckers, but they'll never know if a word you're trying to spell is different from a different word."
14-03-2018T02:56:01,Bgrmystr2,"That is not the spellchecker, that's the grammar rules built into it"
14-03-2018T02:56:10,Bgrmystr2,you're combining everything into one and that's not how it works.
14-03-2018T02:56:27,Bgrmystr2,Something cannot exist without being the sum of it's parts.
14-03-2018T02:56:28,DarthRexKing,I think some spell checkers come with a feature that lets you add a word to your personal database.
14-03-2018T02:56:38,Bgrmystr2,they do.
14-03-2018T02:56:41,Bgrmystr2,even the old ones did.
14-03-2018T02:56:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"My phone tries to predict my sentences, and it helps me see how often I talk about certain things"
14-03-2018T02:56:54,DarthRexKing,"If I remember correctly, either my old phone or iPad has it. Yeah."
14-03-2018T02:57:18,Vatruvius,"This spellchecker, is all programmed as one unit. So though it could be called something else, grammar checker or whatever, it still does both."
14-03-2018T02:57:23,SpazztasticKiwi,But that doesn‚Äôt mean it gets it right
14-03-2018T02:57:29,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, kiwi, they use an algorithm that predicts the next word you'll use based on the first letter and how many times you've used all the words that begin with that one letter."
14-03-2018T02:57:57,Bgrmystr2,but yeah they have no way to read your mind. they have no context.
14-03-2018T02:57:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Especially since I omit words and even use words some people don‚Äôt even know
14-03-2018T02:58:04,Bgrmystr2,so getting mad at them is pointless
14-03-2018T02:58:08,Vatruvius,Yay...algorithms!
14-03-2018T02:58:15,Bgrmystr2,because they cannot tell you what only you know.
14-03-2018T02:58:50,Bgrmystr2,tis why I always look up words to make sure I have the proper word I want before writing stuff.
14-03-2018T02:59:01,Bgrmystr2,granted I don't have to do that much anymore.
14-03-2018T02:59:05,Bgrmystr2,"Still do, sometimes."
14-03-2018T02:59:14,Bgrmystr2,but not often
14-03-2018T02:59:17,Vatruvius,"I try, but really not being able to use my entire keyboard really makes thing tedious."
14-03-2018T02:59:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"It can be difficult understanding what I say in real life, let alone online"
14-03-2018T02:59:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm probably clearer online though
14-03-2018T03:01:29,DarthRexKing,"I am going now, later."
14-03-2018T03:02:07,Vatruvius,"So let me get this straight...we went from airplanes, to rabbits, to pets, to chat bots, to AI, to spell check, to algorithms, to clarity?"
14-03-2018T03:02:14,Vatruvius,Bye Darth
14-03-2018T03:02:51,Bgrmystr2,"Yes. That is normal conversation flow, Vatru."
14-03-2018T03:03:02,Bgrmystr2,Are you still convinced you're not an AI? :P
14-03-2018T03:03:04,Vatruvius,lol...love it
14-03-2018T03:03:29,Bgrmystr2,cuz uh.. most normal people would not question normal conversation flow as abnormal.
14-03-2018T03:03:35,Vatruvius,An AI would probably be more on point than I am. I kind of go all over the point forming connections to thinks that would make no sense to a bot.
14-03-2018T03:04:28,Bgrmystr2,"xD To be fair, bots follow a logic train"
14-03-2018T03:04:33,Bgrmystr2,"it breaks sometimes, but"
14-03-2018T03:04:36,Vatruvius,"I did not say it was abnormal, just following it. I think it is interesting to follow the conversation and see where you ended up. Like that phone game you played in 1st grade."
14-03-2018T03:04:37,Bgrmystr2,they follow it
14-03-2018T03:04:58,Bgrmystr2,phones didn't really exist as a thing when I was in 1st grade.
14-03-2018T03:05:05,Bgrmystr2,so..
14-03-2018T03:05:07,Bgrmystr2,yknow
14-03-2018T03:05:07,Bgrmystr2,xD
14-03-2018T03:06:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Y‚Äôall did that ending stuff. I mainly watched
14-03-2018T03:06:22,Vatruvius,"It was not literal phones. The game was where you said one sentence, like ""I ate a banana,"" and you whisper it to the person on your right, and so on, until it comes back around and you will hear something completely different."
14-03-2018T03:06:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Good thing I already had popcorn
14-03-2018T03:07:20,Vatruvius,"Anyway, I have to go to bed now. Getting up in 6 hours for school. Talk to you all later."
14-03-2018T03:07:44,Bgrmystr2,Mai hates Nurse Nana :V
14-03-2018T03:08:05,Bgrmystr2,but yeah I know that game
14-03-2018T03:09:10,Vatruvius,"One last think to ponder though, there are 18 users on right now watching this chat but only us 3, with Darth 4, are typing. Besides Tom, that leaves 13 people just watching us..."
14-03-2018T03:09:45,Vatruvius,:ptv-uneasy:
14-03-2018T03:09:50,Bgrmystr2,which is also normal
14-03-2018T03:10:11,Vatruvius,You bloody cowards!
14-03-2018T03:10:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt tend to say anything online that I wouldn‚Äôt say in a conversation
14-03-2018T03:10:25,Vatruvius,Night people! :D
14-03-2018T03:10:29,SpazztasticKiwi,They can creep
14-03-2018T03:11:31,SpazztasticKiwi,We have no guarantee that they (including Tom) haven‚Äôt just walked off from their computer or device still logged in
14-03-2018T03:12:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don‚Äôt know if my phone shows me as online when I close my app, eventhough I don‚Äôt technically log out"
14-03-2018T03:14:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Granted it often logs me out automatically when I close out
14-03-2018T03:23:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm going on to bed before I regret staying too late
14-03-2018T03:31:52,TheBeckoner,dang just realized I missed my online midterm for speech...surely that's not a bad thing right?
14-03-2018T03:32:18,TheBeckoner,welp guess I'll watch the stream on youtube. It's better than speech anyway.
14-03-2018T03:32:25,Bgrmystr2,uh.. good job lol
14-03-2018T03:32:53,TheBeckoner,maybe he will open it back up and take points...
14-03-2018T03:48:19,Twokinds,Comic up
14-03-2018T03:50:11,unsteddyphoenix,"Ok, to be fair Maren ""anything else"" and ""dragons"" are two very different things."
14-03-2018T03:51:25,iliar,@Twokinds Did you remember about my request?
14-03-2018T03:52:02,unsteddyphoenix,More credence to the idea that Nibs is a transformed human and is scared of traces manor
14-03-2018T03:52:33,Twokinds,@iliar no
14-03-2018T03:52:52,unsteddyphoenix,lol
14-03-2018T03:53:08,TheBeckoner,nibs is not a nibs confirmed
14-03-2018T03:53:25,TheBeckoner,Also
14-03-2018T03:53:31,TheBeckoner,nice red tree Tom.
14-03-2018T03:53:41,TheBeckoner,always nice trees and grass
14-03-2018T03:53:45,TheBeckoner,:ok_hand:
14-03-2018T04:00:03,Twokinds,Thanks
14-03-2018T04:00:05,Twokinds,G'night
14-03-2018T04:00:32,iliar,"Good night, Tom!"
14-03-2018T04:02:51,unsteddyphoenix,gnight
14-03-2018T05:37:44,Bgrmystr2,I guess dragons would be a fair thing to be afraid of as a squirrel
14-03-2018T05:38:17,Bgrmystr2,"but nibbly wouldn't be spooked by the dragon if the dragon didn't mean any harm, if instincts play the same role there as they do here"
14-03-2018T05:39:21,Bgrmystr2,"Though.. we dunno what dragons eat, so"
14-03-2018T05:39:27,Bgrmystr2,it could very well be just base instincts
14-03-2018T14:49:59,Vatruvius,:ptv-greetings:
14-03-2018T18:44:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm off tomorrow. Should I pull another all night goof or try to sleep at a normal time like a good hooman
14-03-2018T18:50:16,Vatruvius,Cannot really answer for you but I know I am going to Vegas tommarow to Monday to meet family which I will likely miss the streams. :ptv-whiny:
14-03-2018T19:07:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I had family in Vegas. She came back here to be closer to her sister (and farther from her brother) to a ‚Äúslower lifestyle‚Äù
14-03-2018T19:18:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Have fun and don‚Äôt follow anyone into any dark alleys
14-03-2018T19:25:31,Vatruvius,Lol...I would not do that in any city.
14-03-2018T23:11:55,Vatruvius,I guess everyone is sleeping/away?
14-03-2018T23:22:14,Vatruvius,"Here is a good question Tom, what gave you the idea to draw Twokinds in high school? Any particular inspiration?"
