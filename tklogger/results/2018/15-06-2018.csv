15-06-2018T00:04:47,Ordithus,"I suppose it would be handy for him, he lives and breathes his job.  He can work while on vacation"
15-06-2018T00:05:00,Bgrmystr2,to finish his comic Vat
15-06-2018T00:05:20,Bgrmystr2,"fairly common phrase, surprising it came from him"

15-06-2018T00:33:07,Dadrobit,It probably also helps that she doesn't live like a barbarian like the rest of her kin.

15-06-2018T00:36:08,TheBeckoner,I suppose when you die at some point your eyeballs could fall out
15-06-2018T00:36:09,unsteddyphoenix,"I think most would live til like, mid 20s?"
15-06-2018T00:36:14,Dadrobit,"But 30 is around the equivalent of 100+ for a human, so very very rare."
15-06-2018T00:36:37,unsteddyphoenix,Not accounting for lifestyle
15-06-2018T00:36:44,unsteddyphoenix,Since they roll around in GERMS all day
15-06-2018T00:37:07,TheBeckoner,If youre a human smoking and drinking hard will get you to atleast 120
15-06-2018T00:37:09,Dadrobit,"I think that at a rough 3:1 ratio, 20 would put them at 60 to humans, so that's when age really becomes a hard factor."
15-06-2018T00:37:23,JamesBSquirrel3,"To think how keidrans can ongoing age around 30, if possible?"
15-06-2018T00:37:53,unsteddyphoenix,We know they show some physical signs of aging like eye-problems and faded fur and stuff.
15-06-2018T00:38:10,unsteddyphoenix,"But not actually sure how much it affects their like, overall fitness?"
15-06-2018T00:38:27,TheBeckoner,Irl dogs dont really slow down til the very end
15-06-2018T00:38:31,TheBeckoner,unlike humans
15-06-2018T00:38:37,unsteddyphoenix,yeah
15-06-2018T00:38:52,TheBeckoner,which lose considerable physicality at like 40 or so
15-06-2018T00:39:02,TheBeckoner,dang that was slow to type..
15-06-2018T00:39:34,TheBeckoner,I guess if youre life is short the best thing you can have is a long prime
15-06-2018T00:40:09,JamesBSquirrel3,Few more bottom right left

15-06-2018T00:45:22,JamesBSquirrel3,Well some by some can die
15-06-2018T00:46:11,Dadrobit,"Anton's Key has actually been a real theory behind the keidran for a while now with keidran like Euchre demonstrating incredible skill and knowledge once he escaped the social confines of the Keidran and was set ""free"" by the Templar order allowing him to"
15-06-2018T00:46:16,Dadrobit,explore knowlede.
15-06-2018T00:46:22,Dadrobit,knowledge.*

15-06-2018T00:47:23,Dadrobit,But he manage to achieve an extremely high position among the Templar at a very young age.
15-06-2018T00:47:36,Dadrobit,The other keidran are trapped by their culture.
15-06-2018T00:47:54,unsteddyphoenix,Thats racist

15-06-2018T00:49:03,Dadrobit,"Raine is 18, so Euchre is very late 20's."
15-06-2018T00:49:05,Combak,~25
15-06-2018T00:49:10,Dadrobit,(I think she's 18?)

15-06-2018T02:35:12,SageSaga,how is that trolling?
15-06-2018T02:35:31,ZRO4825,"Get us all worked up talking 'bout crying, and then it's just anime. :P"

15-06-2018T02:38:22,SageSaga,thanks Sun ^^
15-06-2018T02:38:48,SageSaga,Steins;Gate* is awesome btw and if anyone hasnt watched it- keep tissues nearby
15-06-2018T02:39:22,sunblaze,I wanted to watch it for some time but so far nah I had other things to do
15-06-2018T02:40:18,SageSaga,the new season is amazing but you must watch the first season ... first XD
15-06-2018T02:42:01,SageSaga,and you can watch it on VRV! if you have access to VRV-
15-06-2018T02:42:44,sunblaze,not in germany :D
15-06-2018T02:46:34,sunblaze,next week I am on the road anyway so finally I have time to watch little witch academia. wanted that for like the last 6 month as well :P
15-06-2018T02:48:09,SageSaga,wow
15-06-2018T02:49:49,ZRO4825,"Reminds me, I need to watch that new Academia show or whatever. Hero Academia? Supposed to be pretty good"
15-06-2018T02:51:42,SageSaga,Yes- My Hero Academia is very good
15-06-2018T02:51:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I can't wait for the next episode
15-06-2018T02:52:30,ZRO4825,My problem with catching up on anime is I have to stop playing games to watch...and then I get restless because I'm not playing a game. :joy:
15-06-2018T02:52:40,sunblaze,^that is mine as well
15-06-2018T02:52:49,MatyMaty,play games in one screen and anime in the other? :O
15-06-2018T02:52:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,My hero is super worth it
15-06-2018T02:53:01,ZRO4825,"Can't do that with subtitles, Maty, and hello! :P"
15-06-2018T02:53:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"watch the dub, Its actually really good"
15-06-2018T02:53:26,sunblaze,2 screens welp with that as an advise play the common games you do not have to think about aanyway and watch on the other one stuff
15-06-2018T02:53:38,ZRO4825,"Well, I mean, I probably COULD do it, but I hate splitting my attention like that, lol"
15-06-2018T02:54:47,sunblaze,that is why I usally only watch action movies during gameplay. less story and stuff to things to thing about :D
15-06-2018T02:54:51,JamesBSquirrel3,Wow! Wow! Wow! Coming up to 7 hour mark(!)

15-06-2018T02:58:17,MatyMaty,hahah
15-06-2018T02:58:27,MatyMaty,well it wasn't like I chose to XD

15-06-2018T02:59:56,MatyMaty,yeaaaj
15-06-2018T03:00:05,MatyMaty,It was taking soo much of my time
15-06-2018T03:00:12,MatyMaty,"I just had to say ""enough"""
15-06-2018T03:01:10,MatyMaty,"For those who don't know, I worked in my aunt's restaurant. Or rather ""helped"". Which means working my ass off for technically no pay"
15-06-2018T03:01:21,ZRO4825,Oh bleh :(
15-06-2018T03:01:29,MatyMaty,"just until they got a ""trustworthy employee"""
15-06-2018T03:01:29,sunblaze,ah I see so now you want some serious work?
15-06-2018T03:01:41,MatyMaty,it's been almost 2 years since

15-06-2018T03:02:02,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-unimpressed: I do not approve of their usage of you with no pay.
15-06-2018T03:02:03,ZRO4825,"Well I can't say I blame ya for that, that's just taking advantage of your good nature at that point &gt;:("
15-06-2018T03:02:13,ZRO4825,Bgr.

15-06-2018T03:02:42,ZRO4825,"Fine, but if you find the corner with the tentacle monster it's your fault, not mine. D:"
15-06-2018T03:02:49,ZRO4825,"Lookin good, Sage. ^_^"

15-06-2018T03:03:02,w0lfmare,:thumbsup:
15-06-2018T03:03:21,MatyMaty,maybe even get Sage to do a fanservice only multi with me every so often :P
15-06-2018T03:03:37,ZRO4825,He still hasn't posted the pics anywhere from the last one he did. :P
15-06-2018T03:03:42,MatyMaty,booo
15-06-2018T03:04:01,ZRO4825,Or if he did he did it on one of the oddball spots. XD
15-06-2018T03:04:05,SageSaga,:P
15-06-2018T03:04:07,MatyMaty,well that might have been good :P
15-06-2018T03:04:07,Bgrmystr2,"Oh I met Lemmy already, zro. Really nice dude. Had a chat about tsunderes over a cup of tea."
15-06-2018T03:04:13,SageSaga,they are secret
15-06-2018T03:04:14,Bgrmystr2,:)\
15-06-2018T03:04:20,MatyMaty,Patreon is suspending tons of accounts as of late
15-06-2018T03:04:34,ZRO4825,"Note to self: Screencap all future fanservicey streams from Sage, gotcha."
15-06-2018T03:04:48,MatyMaty,yus :P
15-06-2018T03:04:54,SageSaga,eh? what are they being suspended for?
15-06-2018T03:05:00,w0lfmare,Dumb stuff
15-06-2018T03:05:01,ZRO4825,Adult work
15-06-2018T03:05:14,ZRO4825,Basically now any patreon with adult work in a public viewable setting gets suspended.
15-06-2018T03:05:17,ZRO4825,Chalo's got nailed
15-06-2018T03:05:18,MatyMaty,apparently if you have anything considered NSFW as a public post
15-06-2018T03:05:33,MatyMaty,Patreon will put a temp suspension until it is all changed to Patrons only
15-06-2018T03:05:34,Bgrmystr2,"wait, is chalo banned from patreon now?"
15-06-2018T03:05:39,Bgrmystr2,or just temp suspended?
15-06-2018T03:05:40,ZRO4825,suspended
15-06-2018T03:05:49,Bgrmystr2,oh okay
15-06-2018T03:05:52,Bgrmystr2,well that's kinda stupid
15-06-2018T03:05:53,ZRO4825,Just seen an e-mail 'bout it a few minutes ago
15-06-2018T03:05:57,MatyMaty,until he removes all the public posts with NSFW content
15-06-2018T03:05:58,JamesBSquirrel3,So that's how it happen Maty.
15-06-2018T03:05:58,SageSaga,how does one know what is NSFW?
15-06-2018T03:06:03,ZRO4825,"And yeah, Patreon's shooting themselves in the foot imo"
15-06-2018T03:06:07,MatyMaty,I have no idea
15-06-2018T03:06:10,w0lfmare,Infinitedge got suspended too
15-06-2018T03:06:21,w0lfmare,Makes me glad I keep things so safe
15-06-2018T03:06:25,ZRO4825,"I didn't know Infinite had a Patreon. Not surprised though, he does good stuff."
15-06-2018T03:06:25,MatyMaty,I guess either Patreon marks ALL your posts in your Patreon is set to NSFW
15-06-2018T03:06:31,Bgrmystr2,Patreon shouldn't have any right to tell ppl what they put on their patreon pages
15-06-2018T03:06:35,MatyMaty,or they actually look through all the Patreons
15-06-2018T03:06:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,My Edgy boy ;-;
15-06-2018T03:06:51,Bgrmystr2,what happens if someone does NSFW stuff but only uses patreon as a tip gar?
15-06-2018T03:06:51,MatyMaty,so Chalo gotta go through years of posts and remove them all
15-06-2018T03:06:53,Bgrmystr2,jar* even
15-06-2018T03:07:02,MatyMaty,"the same, Bgr"
15-06-2018T03:07:12,Bgrmystr2,"see, that's fucked on patreon's part"
15-06-2018T03:07:16,ZRO4825,Yup. Doesn't matter to them.
15-06-2018T03:07:18,Bgrmystr2,they have no right to tell ppl how to post
15-06-2018T03:07:23,SageSaga,i can understand why
15-06-2018T03:07:35,sunblaze,is there an option to set them to non-public? or do you have to repost them to add that?
15-06-2018T03:07:38,SageSaga,NSFW content has a lot of legal issues all over the world
15-06-2018T03:07:42,w0lfmare,"Me too, but they could just put up an age check wall"
15-06-2018T03:07:44,MatyMaty,"the thing is Bgr, patreon doesn't have an age gate"
15-06-2018T03:07:55,MatyMaty,for some crazy reason they refuse to add one
15-06-2018T03:07:58,ZRO4825,"That's the funny part, they DO have a click through for that now."
15-06-2018T03:08:01,Bgrmystr2,"put the NSFW patreon pages under a 'you can't see this page unless you're X age"""
15-06-2018T03:08:06,ZRO4825,It just did it to me earlier tonight on Tom's page.
15-06-2018T03:08:07,w0lfmare,Yeah
15-06-2018T03:08:08,Bgrmystr2,and problem solved
15-06-2018T03:08:15,w0lfmare,But people are still suspended
15-06-2018T03:08:20,ZRO4825,"Made me click a ""You agree that you are over 18"" and yada yada"
15-06-2018T03:08:22,MatyMaty,a lot of people
15-06-2018T03:08:24,SageSaga,they are probably responding to a threat
15-06-2018T03:08:42,ZRO4825,"If I had to take a wager, whoever does their payment system is throwing a fit."
15-06-2018T03:08:43,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, even if they are, sage, they're shooting themselves in the foot"
15-06-2018T03:08:58,Bgrmystr2,I'm expecting a new site similar to patreon to pop up
15-06-2018T03:08:59,SageSaga,i doubt that
15-06-2018T03:08:59,MatyMaty,"They are, Bgr"
15-06-2018T03:09:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Ya'll &lt;3
15-06-2018T03:09:11,w0lfmare,Night
15-06-2018T03:09:12,MatyMaty,But remember Patreon can have its dumb moments
15-06-2018T03:09:23,sunblaze,"^yeah,,,,"
15-06-2018T03:09:28,ZRO4825,"I know a hentai artist who's working up an adult-friendly alternative to Patreon. The more of this kind of stuff Patreon does, the more likely his is to succeed once he gets it up and running."
15-06-2018T03:09:29,w0lfmare,"Yeah, but it's come through for us so far"
15-06-2018T03:09:35,MatyMaty,"remember the ""we want to have few life changing creators rather than many small ones""?"
15-06-2018T03:09:38,SageSaga,it was ridiculous of them to allow NSFW stuff to begin with- its a nightmare
15-06-2018T03:09:38,sunblaze,ok bye and take care everyone!
15-06-2018T03:09:50,ZRO4825,"Take care, Sunblaze"
15-06-2018T03:09:56,JamesBSquirrel3,You need to do a Over 18 required Mature Content Rights in order to change setting to put through.
15-06-2018T03:10:06,MatyMaty,seeya Sunblaze and Pharao
15-06-2018T03:10:15,Bgrmystr2,"bye sun, marv"
15-06-2018T03:10:18,SageSaga,i had a friend who started an adult site- they said fantasy creatures like elves basically counted as bestiality and were not allowed
15-06-2018T03:10:24,MatyMaty,wat
15-06-2018T03:10:33,w0lfmare,Wow
15-06-2018T03:10:33,ZRO4825,dafuq? lol
15-06-2018T03:10:41,Bgrmystr2,Rip their site
15-06-2018T03:10:48,SageSaga,and no credit card company would allow charges through that
15-06-2018T03:10:52,JamesBSquirrel3,It is insane!
15-06-2018T03:10:58,MatyMaty,that's sooo much bs :P
15-06-2018T03:11:16,SageSaga,the CC companies are like Paypal when it comes to porn
15-06-2018T03:11:37,MatyMaty,Sexyfur has used the same CC company for like 20 years
15-06-2018T03:11:43,ZRO4825,"Like, honestly, I don't know why credit card companies are allowed so much leverage over that stuff. It's kinda ridiculous imo."
15-06-2018T03:11:53,MatyMaty,and you know what is crazy Sage?
15-06-2018T03:11:57,SageSaga,uhm
15-06-2018T03:12:00,ZRO4825,Their job is to funnel money. Not determine what it's allowed to be used for.
15-06-2018T03:12:10,MatyMaty,There are adult sites where you can pay with PP
15-06-2018T03:12:10,SageSaga,it makes a lot of sense actually- Credit is different from money
15-06-2018T03:12:17,MatyMaty,"like, webcam sites"
15-06-2018T03:12:32,SageSaga,pretty much any adult site that does that is breaking the rules of PP
15-06-2018T03:12:33,MatyMaty,I saw the post in twitter a few days ago.
15-06-2018T03:13:14,JamesBSquirrel3,"They are what are, becareful about security interven, okay."
15-06-2018T03:13:33,ZRO4825,"I mean, really, let's face it, sex sells, as the old adage goes. The only thing those companies are doing by trying to be limiting like that is keeping themselves from making more money."
15-06-2018T03:14:11,SageSaga,they are trying to prevent themselves from being implicated in a SCANDAL
15-06-2018T03:14:18,MatyMaty,PP or Patreon?
15-06-2018T03:14:22,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, I'm very much expecting a new site like patreon to pop up. As long as patreon demands people hide NSFW behind patron-only posts, they are FORCING every single adult artist to paywall all of their content, literally all of the content they post"
15-06-2018T03:14:23,SageSaga,both
15-06-2018T03:14:29,MatyMaty,bah I dunno
15-06-2018T03:14:41,MatyMaty,There are literal alt-right Patreons
15-06-2018T03:14:46,MatyMaty,that make a lot of money
15-06-2018T03:14:53,MatyMaty,how isn't that scandalous?
15-06-2018T03:15:51,SageSaga,because adult content in the US is heavily seen as inappropriate and illegal in many ways while political opinion is free speech
15-06-2018T03:16:01,ZRO4825,"On the one hand, I understand trying to avoid scandal. On the other hand, porn is (at this point in time) hardly scandalous. Frowned upon, yes, but hardly scandalous."
15-06-2018T03:16:08,MatyMaty,that's kinda dumb :P
15-06-2018T03:16:40,JamesBSquirrel3,"Some users are shouldn't know better, I mean really paranoid."
15-06-2018T03:16:40,ZRO4825,"You can claim the other party is full of poopyheads and all sorts of other untrue rhetoric, but HEY YOU PUT THAT BOOB BACK IN THE SHIRT!!!"
15-06-2018T03:16:43,SageSaga,but it's how things work for now
15-06-2018T03:17:05,MatyMaty,ah well
15-06-2018T03:17:14,ZRO4825,"Doesn't make it any less dumb imo, lol"
15-06-2018T03:17:35,MatyMaty,at least it seems Patreon will return the account to normal once no public NSFW content is out there
15-06-2018T03:17:42,SageSaga,yeah but you need to understand how it works to understand- if Patreon doesnt do what its doing right now- it might go away- and i die
15-06-2018T03:17:54,ZRO4825,"Like, I understand not wanting to slap porn across the billboards and such, and keeping it out of public view. But it's like people are trying to make it seem like porn doesn't exist."
15-06-2018T03:17:55,MatyMaty,o.o
15-06-2018T03:17:58,ZRO4825,"And that's just NOT going to work, lol"
15-06-2018T03:18:19,MatyMaty,meh I dunno Sage
15-06-2018T03:18:22,MatyMaty,look at Steam
15-06-2018T03:18:27,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, you're still up and running right sage?"
15-06-2018T03:18:31,ZRO4825,"I'd still pay ya every month, Sage ^_^"
15-06-2018T03:18:33,JamesBSquirrel3,It is pointless!
15-06-2018T03:18:38,MatyMaty,"they pretty much said ""all is allowed"""
15-06-2018T03:18:59,ZRO4825,"Yeah, Steam about-faced after the backlash they got for trying to chop out ""sexy"" anime Visual Novels."
15-06-2018T03:19:07,MatyMaty,yeah
15-06-2018T03:19:11,ZRO4825,"Just said ""Ya know what? Here, everything goes, police yourselves."""
15-06-2018T03:19:16,MatyMaty,yup
15-06-2018T03:19:25,MatyMaty,"and I mean, it sounds dumb"
15-06-2018T03:19:26,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, your patreon page is still up sage. I'm honestly more worried about people like Chalo, infinite, and other people who rely on the income from patreon to survive each month.. and as long as their acct is under review"
15-06-2018T03:19:28,Bgrmystr2,they get no money
15-06-2018T03:19:50,MatyMaty,but I'm pretty sure they had a law team telling them it was okay
15-06-2018T03:19:53,ZRO4825,Uh....Bgr. Need to rewrite that. Sage relies on his to surviv too. :P
15-06-2018T03:19:54,MatyMaty,and yeah Bgr
15-06-2018T03:19:58,SageSaga,i dont know why I have to explain this- its like i know exactly why they do this and how they have to- but i gotta break it all down for you all just to understand it enough to drop it
15-06-2018T03:20:07,Bgrmystr2,"well yeah zro, but sage is up. not under review"
15-06-2018T03:20:20,MatyMaty,Sage isn't marked as NSFW
15-06-2018T03:20:24,MatyMaty,so he should be okay
15-06-2018T03:20:28,ZRO4825,"Um, Sage, we understand. Or at least I do. Doesn't mean I necessarily AGREE with it. ^^;"
15-06-2018T03:20:33,SageSaga,yeah but is my content SFW?
15-06-2018T03:20:45,MatyMaty,I'd say so
15-06-2018T03:20:46,Bgrmystr2,"Technically, I'd say yes"
15-06-2018T03:20:53,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
15-06-2018T03:20:54,ZRO4825,"Depends on who you ask. Some prudes I'm sure would say it's not, but I say screw them, lol."
15-06-2018T03:21:02,SageSaga,see thats my point
15-06-2018T03:21:10,SageSaga,what do THEY consider NSFW
15-06-2018T03:21:24,MatyMaty,"I mean Sage, there's people who would be like ""why are you showing lesbians to children???"""
15-06-2018T03:21:32,w0lfmare,I'm sure there's a list
15-06-2018T03:21:38,Bgrmystr2,"well, you've got risque art, sure, but nothin pornographic"
15-06-2018T03:21:48,Bgrmystr2,so you're fine imo
15-06-2018T03:21:51,MatyMaty,yeah
15-06-2018T03:21:53,JamesBSquirrel3,It cannot show it under18
15-06-2018T03:21:58,ZRO4825,"Yeah, but it depends on who's doing the reviewing that determines where the line is for ""NSFW"""
15-06-2018T03:22:06,ZRO4825,and THAT is a potential problem.
15-06-2018T03:22:10,MatyMaty,The patreon thing seems to be a mostly automated thing
15-06-2018T03:22:10,SageSaga,Maty that doesnt work
15-06-2018T03:22:30,SageSaga,you show men and women kissing - Lesbians kissing would be the same
15-06-2018T03:22:43,JamesBSquirrel3,Indeed
15-06-2018T03:22:52,MatyMaty,I know :P but I'm just saying what I read in the news
15-06-2018T03:23:12,SageSaga,the point is- Showing porn to someone under 18 is illegal and a site caught doing that can be seriously fined
15-06-2018T03:23:24,SageSaga,and every day they dont correct it - the fine is daily
15-06-2018T03:23:33,ZRO4825,"Well, yes, but isn't that what the idea of an age gate is for?"
15-06-2018T03:23:40,MatyMaty,Bleh Patreon should just put an age gate
15-06-2018T03:23:46,MatyMaty,and be done with it
15-06-2018T03:23:59,ZRO4825,They HAVE one now.
15-06-2018T03:24:01,SageSaga,yes- and they have- but its not enough- they had to act immediately or face being shut down
15-06-2018T03:24:06,SageSaga,then we are all screwed
15-06-2018T03:24:10,w0lfmare,I find it strange that Tom's Patreon wasn't also suspended
15-06-2018T03:24:18,ZRO4825,"Like I said saying earlier, I had to click a ""Yes I'm over 18"" thing just to look at something on Tom's patreon earlier."
15-06-2018T03:24:27,w0lfmare,Since he tagged his NSFW to be safe
15-06-2018T03:24:38,MatyMaty,I guess it might be sometime
15-06-2018T03:24:47,w0lfmare,"Infinitedge did the same and sort of does the same level of stuff, but his was suspended"
15-06-2018T03:24:51,ZRO4825,"Well, technically nothing of Tom's is across the line into NSFW territory either. Nothing any worse than s"
15-06-2018T03:24:53,MatyMaty,"even if the keidran girls have no details, they are still nude"
15-06-2018T03:24:55,ZRO4825,Sage's stuff.*
15-06-2018T03:24:59,MatyMaty,that might count as NSFW
15-06-2018T03:25:15,ZRO4825,I think Tom said he set it that way just in case.
15-06-2018T03:25:33,SageSaga,i have several pictures of girls practically naked
15-06-2018T03:25:48,JamesBSquirrel3,We should not involve to Tom otherwise
15-06-2018T03:25:51,ZRO4825,Toyoko with the cake...been a couple of Kaylin I think
15-06-2018T03:26:10,SageSaga,heck I have Nyna in a hotspring pool with a rubber duck and a little ship blocking her nipples
15-06-2018T03:26:13,ZRO4825,Nyna still hasn't figured out how panties work...
15-06-2018T03:26:31,JamesBSquirrel3,... we could end up spoilers
15-06-2018T03:26:42,MatyMaty,ah well
15-06-2018T03:26:46,ZRO4825,"Not sure what you're referring to there, james."
15-06-2018T03:27:10,ZRO4825,"Honestly, I'm kinda hoping Patreon realizes that they're diving a bit overboard, and that there's a much simpler solution to all this, and everything can go back to normal."
15-06-2018T03:27:21,SageSaga,its not simple
15-06-2018T03:27:22,MatyMaty,"Same, Zro"
15-06-2018T03:27:29,JamesBSquirrel3,Ah! I'm typing things you'll heard conversation
15-06-2018T03:27:33,ZRO4825,"Just strikes me as another Patreon ""We need to fix things"" over-reaction."
15-06-2018T03:27:46,SageSaga,thats what im trying to explain- if they dont nip it - stuff sucks for everyone
15-06-2018T03:28:00,MatyMaty,Yus
15-06-2018T03:28:02,ZRO4825,Right
15-06-2018T03:28:14,MatyMaty,I guess it is only matter of the word going out
15-06-2018T03:28:26,MatyMaty,that you shouldn't have NSFW posts set as public
15-06-2018T03:28:33,w0lfmare,Big thing here is communication I think. We need to know exactly what's going on and why
15-06-2018T03:28:39,SageSaga,complaining about it is the wrong thing to do right now- right now is the time to learn and process and then- suggest solutions
15-06-2018T03:28:45,ZRO4825,^ so much what w0lf said
15-06-2018T03:28:49,Bgrmystr2,"the problem with that, maty, is that everyone will be forced to paywall porn"
15-06-2018T03:28:53,Bgrmystr2,and that's not going to go well
15-06-2018T03:28:56,JamesBSquirrel3,it mean private from public
15-06-2018T03:29:04,MatyMaty,I think something like DA's posting would work
15-06-2018T03:29:21,MatyMaty,Creator has to say if the post is SFW or NSFW
15-06-2018T03:29:22,SageSaga,"i dont see a problem with paywalling porn and being like ""Hey I have a tumblr here -"""
15-06-2018T03:29:33,MatyMaty,and if it is NSFW it is automatically Patrons only
15-06-2018T03:29:41,ZRO4825,"Well, I mean, most of us pay for what of it we get anyway, so THAT part is not necessarily so bad. But for like, say, Chalo, who does a comic with NSFW elements on occasion. I don't pay Chalo (because I've only got so much money each month)"
15-06-2018T03:29:41,Bgrmystr2,"cuz you're not allowed to link offsite to places w/ porn as well, sage"
15-06-2018T03:29:52,ZRO4825,"But I still get to see his posts. This way, I'm not gonna be able to. :("
15-06-2018T03:30:10,MatyMaty,"Chalo posts all his stuff at Tumblr and Twitter too, tho"
15-06-2018T03:30:16,MatyMaty,there is no paywalled content
15-06-2018T03:30:18,ZRO4825,"Yeah, I heard they've been tagging patreons even just with links now."
15-06-2018T03:30:20,w0lfmare,Plus free posts help draw in new Patrons
15-06-2018T03:31:02,SageSaga,"my guess is - if something legal happened they need crush it - and are probably like ""Whoa wait- we made a ton of money on these porn people-"" and they will find a solution"
15-06-2018T03:31:18,MatyMaty,another super easy way would be like
15-06-2018T03:31:27,JamesBSquirrel3,So much to be how to spent from saving money for the most otherwise as it is:ptv-sad:
15-06-2018T03:31:27,w0lfmare,"So, a repeat of December? XD"
15-06-2018T03:31:28,MatyMaty,post a thumbnail or censored version
15-06-2018T03:31:38,ZRO4825,"Pretty much w0lf, lol"
15-06-2018T03:31:42,MatyMaty,"and say like ""full drawing at twitter"""
15-06-2018T03:31:44,MatyMaty,without a link
15-06-2018T03:32:31,SageSaga,so - let's see what's going on
15-06-2018T03:33:17,w0lfmare,"Not a bad idea Maty, though I would add the Twitter name somewhere or something"
15-06-2018T03:33:29,MatyMaty,yus
15-06-2018T03:33:44,ZRO4825,I hate twitter :rofl:
15-06-2018T03:33:54,MatyMaty,Lol why Zro?
15-06-2018T03:34:03,ZRO4825,"idk, just something 'bout the way it works just irritates me"
15-06-2018T03:34:18,ZRO4825,"Then again I don't like reddit either, so I'm just weird, lol"
15-06-2018T03:34:20,Bgrmystr2,everything about twitter I dislike.
15-06-2018T03:34:20,Bgrmystr2,so
15-06-2018T03:34:21,MatyMaty,I only hate twitter when I click something and then see an amazing art or artist suggestion
15-06-2018T03:34:33,JamesBSquirrel3,mine as well
15-06-2018T03:34:34,Bgrmystr2,I don't like most sites tho
15-06-2018T03:34:40,MatyMaty,only to go back and see it is gone forever
15-06-2018T03:34:45,ZRO4825,D:
15-06-2018T03:35:03,Bgrmystr2,"Don't like reddit, or twitter, any of the social medias, tumblr, facebook, imgrrr, etc etc"
15-06-2018T03:35:06,Bgrmystr2,meh
15-06-2018T03:35:17,ZRO4825,"I hate it because like, I'll click on a linked post, get to it, be like ""Oh cool"" go to click around it for some reason and it just poofs off the screen and I can't find it again, lol"
15-06-2018T03:35:45,MatyMaty,Only BBS and Usenet :v
15-06-2018T03:35:54,MatyMaty,"same, Zro XD"
15-06-2018T03:35:56,ZRO4825,"Also, while we're griping about Patreon, can someone PLEASE tell them that endlessly scrolling pages are NOT a great way to do things? Cuz OMG does that suck when you're trying to find a picture."
15-06-2018T03:36:11,ZRO4825,"Seriously, let us just use PAGES like a normal damned website! @.@"
15-06-2018T03:36:31,Bgrmystr2,xD
15-06-2018T03:36:37,Bgrmystr2,give us the option
15-06-2018T03:36:39,ZRO4825,"Nooo, gotta use that stupid ""Load more"" button. &gt;:("
15-06-2018T03:36:43,JamesBSquirrel3,It couldn't see as far as too slow?
15-06-2018T03:36:49,w0lfmare,Agreed XD
15-06-2018T03:36:50,MatyMaty,I guess the endless scrolling is for phones :P
15-06-2018T03:36:57,ZRO4825,I've gone hunting for pictures doing that before and had to load so damned much more that my computer starts to lag.
15-06-2018T03:37:05,Bgrmystr2,"cuz there's image sites I surf that give the option, and I like the scrolling more"
15-06-2018T03:37:06,ZRO4825,"Seriously, that is dumb. :O"
15-06-2018T03:37:12,SageSaga,there is a lot they can do to improve things
15-06-2018T03:37:17,Bgrmystr2,but it also gives previews on every image and shows like.. 8 or so per row..
15-06-2018T03:37:18,MatyMaty,which makes it absurd you have to deal with it on a browser
15-06-2018T03:37:29,w0lfmare,Tags were a step at least. Now we need a search
15-06-2018T03:37:31,Bgrmystr2,like 7 or so rows a screen
15-06-2018T03:37:36,MatyMaty,I really like the Tumblr archive option
15-06-2018T03:37:37,ZRO4825,"I usually do too, Bgr, but there's a point where your computer's like ""Load a seperate page, asshole!"" :joy:"
15-06-2018T03:37:44,MatyMaty,you can just check month by month
15-06-2018T03:37:44,SageSaga,my first complaint - 5 tags max for a post XD
15-06-2018T03:37:47,MatyMaty,or year by year
15-06-2018T03:37:51,ZRO4825,"omg yes, stupid tag limit, lol"
15-06-2018T03:38:04,ZRO4825,"Especially with the way you're batch-uploading for the month now, Sage :joy:"
15-06-2018T03:38:09,w0lfmare,You max out your tags?
15-06-2018T03:38:10,ZRO4825,There's no way in HELL to tag all the characters now XD
15-06-2018T03:38:14,JamesBSquirrel3,That kind a work senario
15-06-2018T03:38:16,MatyMaty,"that means Sage, never draw more than 5 charas in a drawing .P"
15-06-2018T03:38:36,ZRO4825,"Sage is screwed either way now, since he went to uploading the whole month in one post. :joy:"
15-06-2018T03:38:49,MatyMaty,:p
15-06-2018T03:38:56,ZRO4825,"Cuz that's...what, 5 or 6 sketches + the color images? All with different characters usually. :rofl:"
15-06-2018T03:39:02,SageSaga,yep
15-06-2018T03:39:35,MatyMaty,"eek, is almost 4:00 am here :astonished:"
15-06-2018T03:39:50,MatyMaty,Time to try to sleep :(
15-06-2018T03:40:02,ZRO4825,almost 5 our time :P
15-06-2018T03:40:26,SageSaga,looks like Camgirls are being hit the hardest
15-06-2018T03:40:44,MatyMaty,I can imagine
15-06-2018T03:40:56,ZRO4825,"Not supposed to hit your ladies, it's not right. :V"
15-06-2018T03:40:57,w0lfmare,On Patreon???
15-06-2018T03:41:06,w0lfmare,Didn't even know that was a thing
15-06-2018T03:41:18,ZRO4825,"I'm with w0lf though, had NO clue that was a thing on Patreon, lol"
15-06-2018T03:41:25,SageSaga,yeah thats why there is such a big wide sweeping thing
15-06-2018T03:41:33,ZRO4825,:facepalm:
15-06-2018T03:41:41,MatyMaty,well W0lf they do it as cosplay
15-06-2018T03:41:50,SageSaga,there are so many cam girls - probably 50 for every hentai artist
15-06-2018T03:41:55,MatyMaty,Yeah
15-06-2018T03:41:58,ZRO4825,O_O;;;
15-06-2018T03:42:02,ZRO4825,holy shit
15-06-2018T03:42:14,ZRO4825,And here I am just seeing Sage and Tom and Fluff's stuff.
15-06-2018T03:42:16,ZRO4825,wth
15-06-2018T03:42:21,MatyMaty,even a couple artists who have two patreons
15-06-2018T03:42:31,MatyMaty,one for art and one for lewd photos
15-06-2018T03:42:33,ZRO4825,I coulda been hookin up with camgirls on Patreon! I've been bamboozled! D:
15-06-2018T03:42:40,MatyMaty,lol Zro
15-06-2018T03:42:46,MatyMaty,there are artist camgirls too :P
15-06-2018T03:42:48,ZRO4825,"Oh, wait, I like the artwork better anyway, nevermind, all is well!"
15-06-2018T03:42:59,ZRO4825,"Get off the cameras, Maty! :P"
15-06-2018T03:43:04,SageSaga,and they are slamming Patreon with such gems like this -
15-06-2018T03:43:04,MatyMaty,lmao
15-06-2018T03:43:18,SageSaga,"""Is your company morally against sex workers?"""
15-06-2018T03:43:30,MatyMaty,actually considered starting one like that cuz the money seems to be pretty good &lt;__&lt;
15-06-2018T03:43:34,ZRO4825,XD
15-06-2018T03:43:42,Bgrmystr2,maty pls
15-06-2018T03:43:55,ZRO4825,"Eh, way I see it, if they're not hurting anyone, let'em do what they want. ^_^"
15-06-2018T03:44:12,MatyMaty,"Beats doing it for free, Zro :P"
15-06-2018T03:44:19,MatyMaty,"er, Bgr"
15-06-2018T03:44:24,ZRO4825,"Well yeah, I certainly won't argue that o_o;"
15-06-2018T03:44:52,MatyMaty,but yeah. The arts and crafts section on Twitch has kinda the same trouble
15-06-2018T03:44:56,ZRO4825,"I mean, as a viewer, nothing beats free, but fair is fair :joy:"
15-06-2018T03:45:10,Bgrmystr2,"I think if sex wasn't seen as some obscene thing cuz everyone is prudes, sex wouldn't be such a big industry with so much money in it."
15-06-2018T03:45:23,ZRO4825,"Really? Because Twitch is VERY much anti-NSFW, so I'm not sure how that'd fly on there at all. :o"
15-06-2018T03:45:28,Bgrmystr2,and it wouldn't be such a big deal for ppl to get into it
15-06-2018T03:45:34,MatyMaty,"there are streams like ""I'm gonna make some halloween decoration crafts! I just happen to wear a bikini just because"""
15-06-2018T03:45:34,SageSaga,again- the issue is parts of it are illegal - simple as that
15-06-2018T03:45:50,MatyMaty,"and bam, a few hundreds a night in tips :P"
15-06-2018T03:45:57,JamesBSquirrel3,On the otherhand about Salary as well?
15-06-2018T03:46:25,SageSaga,and yeah Maty- those streams are getting removed
15-06-2018T03:46:28,ZRO4825,"Yeah, Maty, can't argue that. Tips are always better when you appeal to the horny masses, lol"
15-06-2018T03:47:01,MatyMaty,well that's okay sage
15-06-2018T03:47:17,ZRO4825,And yet I throw most of my patreon money at one of the two SFW artists on my list. :thinking:  :rofl:
15-06-2018T03:47:48,MatyMaty,Twitch is not the place for that .P
15-06-2018T03:47:52,JamesBSquirrel3,Works most of them time
15-06-2018T03:48:05,MatyMaty,They should just post it in twitter like I do :P
15-06-2018T03:48:10,ZRO4825,"Exactly, Maty. That's not what Twitch is for. You wanna be a camgirl, go to pornhub....or that XD"
15-06-2018T03:48:56,MatyMaty,But yeh. I think patreon should start cracking down in some things
15-06-2018T03:49:15,MatyMaty,like all the camming
15-06-2018T03:49:30,ZRO4825,"Cracking down is fine imo. But the way they do it REALLY needs some fine-tuning, imo, lol"
15-06-2018T03:49:32,MatyMaty,and all of those weird Patreons that doesn't seem to offer anything at all
15-06-2018T03:49:48,JamesBSquirrel3,The hardest things what we should? Earnings.
15-06-2018T03:50:05,w0lfmare,"If it's also cosplay, how CAN they remove it?"
15-06-2018T03:50:21,MatyMaty,"Be either ""I'm creating free opinions and pride in our heritage"" or the ""I'm creating feminism and convesations on diversity"""
15-06-2018T03:50:27,MatyMaty,"Like, what?"
15-06-2018T03:50:27,SageSaga,i would like to see what the suspension emails look like
15-06-2018T03:50:40,MatyMaty,that's literally asking money to post tweets
15-06-2018T03:50:44,MatyMaty,it's absurd
15-06-2018T03:50:57,w0lfmare,Yeah that'd be easy to remove
15-06-2018T03:50:59,JamesBSquirrel3,Never work on that(!)
15-06-2018T03:51:23,MatyMaty,I'll ask Chalo for it and send it to ya tomorrow Sage
15-06-2018T03:51:26,SageSaga,i really wish i could just be pissed off about children being taken from their parents but no- now i gotta worry about Patreon
15-06-2018T03:51:34,w0lfmare,"""I'm creating carbon dioxide and new high score at my local arcade"""

15-06-2018T03:52:32,JamesBSquirrel3,Well we will wait and see next.
15-06-2018T03:52:36,MatyMaty,:(
15-06-2018T03:52:39,ZRO4825,and lol w0lf :joy:
15-06-2018T03:53:22,SageSaga,ok i think i found where i might be safe
15-06-2018T03:53:34,MatyMaty,"I think if anything Sage, you might have to do the same as Tom and set your Patreon to NSFW and just make all posts Patron only."
15-06-2018T03:53:41,SageSaga,"""We also require that all public content on your page be appropriate for all audiences. """
15-06-2018T03:54:10,JamesBSquirrel3,That circumstance to me
15-06-2018T03:54:39,Bgrmystr2,dunno what tom's going to do. he doesn't do any patron-only posts unless it's for voting or whatnot
15-06-2018T03:54:42,SageSaga,they have a much longer explanation of adult content
15-06-2018T03:55:01,MatyMaty,oh boy
15-06-2018T03:55:18,w0lfmare,Oh?
15-06-2018T03:55:21,MatyMaty,a long explanation on what it is NSFW
15-06-2018T03:55:27,MatyMaty,that sounds confusing

15-06-2018T03:57:14,MatyMaty,well it pretty much states a lot of the cosplay patreons are just plainly not allowed
15-06-2018T03:57:25,SageSaga,yep
15-06-2018T03:57:33,MatyMaty,"but the whole ""fringe content"" is too vague"
15-06-2018T03:57:39,ZRO4825,"To be fair, a lot of them imo were WAY overcharging as is &lt;_&lt;;;"
15-06-2018T03:57:48,JamesBSquirrel3,It is unfortunally.
15-06-2018T03:57:49,Bgrmystr2,"if it's not acceptable for all ages, they are going to force you to paywall it, and that's not something they should be able to choose."
15-06-2018T03:58:17,SageSaga,"yeah they have to leave it open so if something comes up they can cover it under that umbrella but also say ""Sorry we didnt make that more clear-"" and they will take a punch and have it removed"
15-06-2018T03:58:40,MatyMaty,"well yes, but my problem is like"
15-06-2018T03:59:00,MatyMaty,it seems it all comes down to whoever from the staff reviews it
15-06-2018T03:59:49,SageSaga,it can - but see they can have a more official list of fetishes they dont allow
15-06-2018T03:59:52,MatyMaty,That always makes me uncomfortable
15-06-2018T03:59:57,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, I don't see myself using patreon in the future if they're going to do this."
15-06-2018T04:00:02,SageSaga,that only they have access to and wont make it public
15-06-2018T04:00:03,ZRO4825,"Honestly, yeah, it seems pretty clear cut to me."
15-06-2018T04:00:13,MatyMaty,yeah
15-06-2018T04:00:43,JamesBSquirrel3,Private? Means No any Publics
15-06-2018T04:00:44,MatyMaty,"But yeh, I think you are in the clear, Sage"
15-06-2018T04:00:45,ZRO4825,"They're basically saying ""All your REALLY fucked up shit, please don't bring that here"" lol"
15-06-2018T04:01:05,ZRO4825,Which I can't rightly say I blame them for o.o;
15-06-2018T04:01:11,MatyMaty,yeah
15-06-2018T04:01:12,Bgrmystr2,"by ""really fucked up shit"" you mean ""anything 18+ in general"", zro, then yeah"
15-06-2018T04:01:17,SageSaga,i need patreon - i cant support myself without it- so thats why im so adamant that yall chill and dont let me die over this
15-06-2018T04:01:29,MatyMaty,it makes me wonder if they had many Patreons like that
15-06-2018T04:01:39,MatyMaty,to the point they had to be so specific
15-06-2018T04:01:59,JamesBSquirrel3,Like in anyways have
15-06-2018T04:02:01,Bgrmystr2,"well, it's not like we can do anything about patreon sage lol"
15-06-2018T04:02:03,MatyMaty,awww sorry Sage :(
15-06-2018T04:02:03,ZRO4825,"Sage, whoa, dude, we're on your side for the most part on this. We're just trying to keep them from slamming down on peeps like Fluff and them too is all. ^^;"
15-06-2018T04:02:20,Bgrmystr2,prettymuch ^
15-06-2018T04:02:54,JamesBSquirrel3,I have to admit this scenario's

15-06-2018T04:14:48,Bgrmystr2,and not seeming to get any better

15-06-2018T04:28:09,Bgrmystr2,https://www.patreon.com/guidelines#adult-content read it for yourself.
15-06-2018T04:34:51,Xexanoth,"yeah, those have been in effect for awhile, but any reason given why it now hit's furrry artist that don't do porn?"
15-06-2018T04:36:17,Bgrmystr2,it hits more than just them
15-06-2018T04:36:27,Bgrmystr2,hitting cam girls really hard
15-06-2018T04:36:30,Bgrmystr2,among other ppl
15-06-2018T04:36:42,Xexanoth,"well, most camgirls sell porn so"
15-06-2018T04:36:52,Xexanoth,thats kinda obvious that they get hit

15-06-2018T14:36:12,JamesBSquirrel3,I see already start it colours
15-06-2018T14:56:27,ZRO4825,"Bleeeh, this heat is ick today. Tempted to actually use my car's AC for once. -.-"

15-06-2018T15:09:20,JamesBSquirrel3,"Well I don't know what's going, but I don't like to treated thread socienty points especially Sage rules it is."

15-06-2018T15:10:09,SageSaga,i can't decode your messages today James
15-06-2018T15:10:31,Xexanoth,It's like sometime his translator just breaks
15-06-2018T15:10:35,JamesBSquirrel3,Huh? Why not? Is something wrong?
15-06-2018T15:11:01,SageSaga,"Yes, your previous 2 messages make no sense in English"
15-06-2018T15:11:44,JamesBSquirrel3,"Oh. But someone though it said that a thing or two, was it?"
15-06-2018T15:12:20,Bgrmystr2,hahaha gl sage
15-06-2018T15:12:51,SageSaga,James that also made no sense

15-06-2018T15:17:26,JamesBSquirrel3,Anyway I should stop talking a mess
15-06-2018T15:18:12,ZRO4825,I have a different reason for not using my AC. Kills my gas mileage :P
15-06-2018T15:19:41,SageSaga,man i havent filled my gas tank in my car in almost 2 months now
15-06-2018T15:22:47,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce: Hello!

15-06-2018T15:23:43,ZRO4825,"I think it's been almost 2 days since I put gas in my car, lol"
15-06-2018T15:23:55,Grip,Hi Tom
15-06-2018T15:26:14,Twokinds,Not filling up for 2 months would still be pretty frequent for me. XD
15-06-2018T15:26:56,Mihari,Is that good for a car? O_o
15-06-2018T15:27:00,SageSaga,yeah but you  risk your gas going bad levels of refueling
15-06-2018T15:27:18,SageSaga,its bad if you dont at least drive it a bit
15-06-2018T15:27:21,Twokinds,lol yeah my gas tends to start going bad before it runs out XD
15-06-2018T15:27:24,Twokinds,I've filled up my car once this year.
15-06-2018T15:27:39,SageSaga,=_=
15-06-2018T15:28:22,Weonitus,seems sustainable

15-06-2018T15:28:50,Twokinds,I've had my mother start to drive it around every now and then just so things don't get clogged or whatever.
15-06-2018T15:29:08,SageSaga,good
15-06-2018T15:29:54,SageSaga,still- its not good
15-06-2018T15:30:09,SageSaga,to have that old of gas in your tank
15-06-2018T15:30:53,Bgrmystr2,"that sythe riding nibbly image turned out goddamned great, Tom"
15-06-2018T15:31:04,Bgrmystr2,just saw it
15-06-2018T15:32:05,Xexanoth,i would be more worried about the battery
15-06-2018T15:32:20,Xexanoth,they generally don't like it if you don'T drive the car for long periods of time
15-06-2018T15:32:45,Xexanoth,totally never happened to me *cough*
15-06-2018T15:33:40,Twokinds,That's just what the gas companies want you to say.
15-06-2018T15:33:50,Twokinds,So you buy more gas!
15-06-2018T15:34:08,iliar,Hmm ... I don't drive very much. Sometimes it seems to me that I do not need a car at all. But the full tank is only 300 miles. You have not traveled less than 300 miles since the beginning of the year.
15-06-2018T15:34:15,Bgrmystr2,easily solved problem. Don't go anywhere and don't own a car! :D
15-06-2018T15:34:20,Weonitus,the mad man
15-06-2018T15:34:28,Bgrmystr2,"no car, no gas, no problem."
15-06-2018T15:34:48,Xexanoth,until you need to drive somewhere
15-06-2018T15:34:57,Bgrmystr2,I never need to drive anywhere.

15-06-2018T15:41:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve gotten to where I prefer not driving
15-06-2018T15:41:37,iliar,"@Twokinds Tom, I want to ask. Is Therie pregnant on this art? https://www.patreon.com/posts/guess-whos-to-19452371 If I'm not mistaken, Humans and Keidran can not have children. But she looks pregnant."
15-06-2018T15:43:05,SageSaga,=_=
15-06-2018T15:43:45,SageSaga,you might wanna read the comic again and perhaps notice that Flora is pregnant
15-06-2018T15:44:17,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah I was gonna say, if you hadn't noticed, flora's been pregnant for a while"
15-06-2018T15:45:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don’t think it’s really that Keidran and human relationships can’t equal pregnancy, i feel it maybe more like no one’s ever reported when or if it’s happened because of the racism"

15-06-2018T15:45:48,Bgrmystr2,Kiwi.. no
15-06-2018T15:45:50,Bgrmystr2,xD
15-06-2018T15:45:54,iliar,Flora is an exception.
15-06-2018T15:46:03,SageSaga,no
15-06-2018T15:46:04,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s that too
15-06-2018T15:46:11,Bgrmystr2,that's not even what happened
15-06-2018T15:46:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I know.
15-06-2018T15:46:15,SageSaga,omg
15-06-2018T15:46:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m also half paying attention
15-06-2018T15:46:54,Bgrmystr2,Flora became pregnant because neutral allowed children from human and keidran relationships.
15-06-2018T15:47:05,Bgrmystr2,it happened in the comic.
15-06-2018T15:47:15,Bgrmystr2,"srsly, it was said"
15-06-2018T15:47:16,SageSaga,there's a comic where a god blatantly undoes the restriction on crossbreeding - i dont know how anyone can miss that
15-06-2018T15:47:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"Like I said, there’s that too"
15-06-2018T15:47:27,Bgrmystr2,"you said the opposite of it, kiwi"
15-06-2018T15:47:28,Bgrmystr2,xD
15-06-2018T15:47:30,iliar,Mask helped them to have children http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/206/
15-06-2018T15:48:02,SageSaga,not just them
15-06-2018T15:48:08,SageSaga,all keidrans and humans
15-06-2018T15:48:28,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s one theory I’ve seen that makes sense only without the info from the comic
15-06-2018T15:48:42,Bgrmystr2,Neutral is talking about allowing the human/keidran hybrids
15-06-2018T15:48:43,SpazztasticKiwi,As much sense as it could make - improbable
15-06-2018T15:49:19,iliar,Can you give an example of another couple Humans and Keidran who have children?
15-06-2018T15:49:52,SageSaga,you just gave one
15-06-2018T15:50:08,Xexanoth,"no, because in universe it only happened very recently and the comic is focues on a handful of people"
15-06-2018T15:50:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Never said the theory was foolproof. Most I’ve come across are that way
15-06-2018T15:50:28,SageSaga,you want Tom to draw every human in the world having sex with a keidran? thats gonna be an expensive commission
15-06-2018T15:50:51,SpazztasticKiwi,It rubbed me the wrong way because it meant the possibility of seeing other hybrids as adults
15-06-2018T15:50:55,Ordithus,I return!
15-06-2018T15:51:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Ord! ✌🏻
15-06-2018T15:51:15,Ordithus,Yo Kiwi
15-06-2018T15:52:02,Bgrmystr2,hey kiwi
15-06-2018T15:52:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Yes? 🙂
15-06-2018T15:52:23,Bgrmystr2,what's wrong with having other hybrids beyond flora and trace's kids?
15-06-2018T15:52:32,Bgrmystr2,why would that rub you the wrong way?
15-06-2018T15:52:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Wouldn’t they be treated differently from both sides?
15-06-2018T15:52:56,iliar,"You do not have to draw. In the comic, Trace says that he did not even hear a single mention of hybrids."
15-06-2018T15:52:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"“Not one of us, but not us either”"
15-06-2018T15:53:17,SageSaga,omg
15-06-2018T15:53:37,Ordithus,It's a new thing.  Flora is the first hybrid momma
15-06-2018T15:54:30,Xexanoth,"i mean, if we go by sketches Therie will probably beat flora XD"
15-06-2018T15:55:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Who knows
15-06-2018T15:55:58,SpazztasticKiwi,But maybe not as it seems
15-06-2018T15:56:31,Ordithus,"The Therie, then Maren..."
15-06-2018T15:56:37,Ordithus,*Then Therie

15-06-2018T15:58:30,SageSaga,it wasnt possible - but then a GOD made it possible
15-06-2018T15:58:33,Ordithus,"iliar, like we've been saying, this is a new thing."
15-06-2018T15:58:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Power is out at work
15-06-2018T15:59:08,Ordithus,There are probably quite a few unexpecting expecting mothers
15-06-2018T15:59:23,Xexanoth,Iliar you were the one who posted the link to the page where the Mask changed the rules of the world....
15-06-2018T15:59:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I think I got it all now
15-06-2018T15:59:49,Xexanoth,he didn't just change the rules for flora and trace but for everyone
15-06-2018T16:00:03,iliar,Why do you think that the mask has made this available for all.
15-06-2018T16:00:24,SageSaga,it says in that comic
15-06-2018T16:00:29,SageSaga,to preserve the Keidran race
15-06-2018T16:00:42,SageSaga,you cant do that with ONE BABY
15-06-2018T16:00:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I gotta go. Can’t clock in cause no power and I have no idea what we’re supposed to be doing
15-06-2018T16:00:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Be back later
15-06-2018T16:00:54,Ordithus,Bye Kiwi
15-06-2018T16:01:32,Xexanoth,also im pretty sure tom answered the question in chat before that it was for everyone...
15-06-2018T16:02:19,w0lfmare,One baby to rule them all
15-06-2018T16:02:46,Xexanoth,*baby dies before growing up because thats what happens in medival times*
15-06-2018T16:03:18,iliar,Hmm ... Sounds reasonable. I always thought that the mask affected only Trace and Flora

15-06-2018T16:09:17,SageSaga,"native american tribes did it, Mayans, Aztecs, English, Japanese, Chinese, Mongolians- even African tribes- so- yeah- everywhere but Antarctica-  unless- ah right- King Penguins- there too"

15-06-2018T16:10:13,Xexanoth,"for most people really, but the stereotype is that germans are sticklers for rules so..."
15-06-2018T16:10:23,SageSaga,ha- go back far enough and they still crushed babies with stones
15-06-2018T16:11:15,SageSaga,it took a while for England to come up with their rules for what counted as royal blood
15-06-2018T16:11:53,SageSaga,XD even after they did there were lots of issues
15-06-2018T16:12:07,SageSaga,turns out it's hard to prove one is ordained by God to rule over men-
15-06-2018T16:12:18,Xexanoth,"europeans having issues with their kings? nah, you must be joking XD"
15-06-2018T16:12:24,Ordithus,Democracy is so much less bloody an affair
15-06-2018T16:12:36,Xexanoth,but with the same stupid results
15-06-2018T16:12:44,SageSaga,nah sometimes worse
15-06-2018T16:12:56,SageSaga,if you keep people dumb then your society is controlled by idiots
15-06-2018T16:13:17,Xexanoth,if your kings are inbred idiots it's just as bad
15-06-2018T16:14:07,SageSaga,its the problem with Democracy - my vote counts that same as that guy- you know who im talking about
15-06-2018T16:14:45,Xexanoth,at least in democracy the presidents are bound by some laws
15-06-2018T16:14:56,Xexanoth,so we got that going for us
15-06-2018T16:15:02,SageSaga,&lt;_&lt;
15-06-2018T16:15:12,Ordithus,Though constiutional monarchies tend towards the same
15-06-2018T16:16:23,SageSaga,you have a serious problem when your government is arguing that their leader cant be prosecuted because they are the law.
15-06-2018T16:16:54,Ordithus,That becomes the exact same thing as classic monarchies
15-06-2018T16:17:01,Ordithus,Or dictatorshps
15-06-2018T16:17:34,Bgrmystr2,it may as well be a dictatorship under a different name if you can't hold the leader responsible for stupid shit they did.
15-06-2018T16:18:06,Ordithus,"If they don't have to abide by law or other restrictions, it is one."
15-06-2018T16:18:38,Xexanoth,"they usually only have a limited immunity, depending on the crime or depending on the Vote of other governing bodies"

15-06-2018T16:20:22,Xexanoth,XD
15-06-2018T16:20:39,SageSaga,it has claimed it will just pardon itself of any wrong doing
15-06-2018T16:20:49,Xexanoth,except he can't
15-06-2018T16:21:15,Xexanoth,"there's actual predecent(?) for that, that a president cannot pardon himself"
15-06-2018T16:21:23,Ordithus,That depends entirely upon what would happen if it was tried...
15-06-2018T16:21:26,SageSaga,it's team says it can and thats more than enough to be upset
15-06-2018T16:22:10,SageSaga,just saying it is an option should be reason enough to not trust it
15-06-2018T16:22:30,Xexanoth,his team can say whatever it wants when the judicial system says something else...
15-06-2018T16:22:54,Ordithus,The US has a somewhat unusual history of listening to the courts... I hope that continues
15-06-2018T16:23:28,SageSaga,even if it's not correct- it's trying to manipulate the system it is supposed to stand for- it's already admitted it's goal now is to turn people against the FBI to win a popularity poll to prevent impeachment
15-06-2018T16:23:49,Xexanoth,everyone always manipulates the system
15-06-2018T16:24:04,Ordithus,"I like how you keep using ""it"".  Like ""it"" is a tentacle beast or something"
15-06-2018T16:24:09,Xexanoth,trump just does it much more obvious
15-06-2018T16:24:11,Ordithus,:ptv-laugh:
15-06-2018T16:24:48,Xexanoth,"then again he targets the idiots, so...."
15-06-2018T16:24:54,SageSaga,exactly
15-06-2018T16:25:19,SageSaga,"that's the weakness of a democracy, the idiots that have a voice"
15-06-2018T16:25:31,SageSaga,my goal wouldnt be to take away that voice- but to educate it
15-06-2018T16:25:49,Ordithus,When loyalty to a person trumps loyalty to an ideal...
15-06-2018T16:26:07,SageSaga,the more intelligent a democratic nation the better off it becomes
15-06-2018T16:26:21,Xexanoth,not really
15-06-2018T16:26:36,Xexanoth,there's plenty of really smart people that stand for really stupid things
15-06-2018T16:26:54,Xexanoth,you'd be surprised at how many smart people are in the alt right over here in europe
15-06-2018T16:27:27,Ordithus,Lots of highly educated engineers support the tentacle monster...
15-06-2018T16:27:52,MatyMaty,"Don't worry Sage, eventually we will all be ruled by a god like A.I that will decide what is better for us based solely in logic :P"
15-06-2018T16:27:58,Ordithus,"Heck, I know some engineers who believe in flat earth :ptv-unimpressed:"
15-06-2018T16:28:00,SageSaga,"im aware- im also aware of their  tactics, but i believe intelligent people are better equipped to handle intelligent monsters"
15-06-2018T16:28:46,SageSaga,smart nazis are able to lead a bunch of dumb people
15-06-2018T16:29:06,Xexanoth,"the problem is, the smarter everyone becomes, so do the monsters"
15-06-2018T16:29:06,Ordithus,"It's not just general intelligence that is needed to prevent such things, though"
15-06-2018T16:29:15,SageSaga,"but if all those dumb people were as smart as their ""leaders"" i think they could reason better and realize ""Hey- being a Nazi is dumb"""
15-06-2018T16:29:30,Ordithus,"Education in civics, and the ideals of democracy, law, equal rights..."
15-06-2018T16:29:39,Ordithus,That is probably more important.
15-06-2018T16:29:55,SageSaga,which means more educated people
15-06-2018T16:30:07,Bgrmystr2,which maens general intelligence. :v
15-06-2018T16:30:09,Ordithus,"Yes, though more specific"
15-06-2018T16:30:19,Bgrmystr2,there's a lot more to it than that
15-06-2018T16:30:48,Bgrmystr2,that alone won't make a populous less-likely to be taken over by dumb
15-06-2018T16:31:05,Bgrmystr2,it'll help though
15-06-2018T16:31:23,SageSaga,yeah im giving a general solution - of course its more complicated than that
15-06-2018T16:31:34,Ordithus,Yeah
15-06-2018T16:31:52,Bgrmystr2,I was throwing that at Ord
15-06-2018T16:31:56,SageSaga,but if everyone in your society is like a doctor you can trust them more to think things through than a guy who cant even read

15-06-2018T16:33:04,SageSaga,well the further you get into logic the less Morality makes sense XD
15-06-2018T16:33:19,Bgrmystr2,need a healthy balance

15-06-2018T16:34:21,Bgrmystr2,:v
15-06-2018T16:34:30,Bgrmystr2,bonus points if you get the reference
15-06-2018T16:34:32,Ordithus,"Logic can't really define ""good"" or ""bad"", only utility"
15-06-2018T16:35:12,Bgrmystr2,thankfully we can use logic based on morals
15-06-2018T16:35:22,Bgrmystr2,and the best way of achieving it
15-06-2018T16:36:03,Bgrmystr2,one without the other is like missing a puzzle piece
15-06-2018T16:36:11,SageSaga,"Morality changes though based on many different things- you have morality ordained by God and you have personal morality- and then you have a bunch of people that are like ""Morality isnt real at all"""
15-06-2018T16:37:10,Bgrmystr2,"well, I mean.. what IS real, even? We're all in the matrix after all, sooo."
15-06-2018T16:37:25,SageSaga,"""My god says this is wrong so therefore it is wrong"" ""I say this is wrong because i want it to be"" ""Nothing is right or wrong"""
15-06-2018T16:38:32,Ordithus,All can be terrifying or good in their own ways... then again what is good even
15-06-2018T16:38:56,SageSaga,here's a good example - Hurting people is wrong. Hurting animals is wrong. Hey- let's kill and eat that animal.
15-06-2018T16:39:34,Xexanoth,"well, it's ""hurting for fun"" that is wrong, not ""hurting for a good reason"""
15-06-2018T16:39:42,Ordithus,"If they didn't taste so good, we wouldn't have this problem :P"
15-06-2018T16:39:53,Xexanoth,hurting people isn'T wrong when you're trying to defend yourself from an attack etc...
15-06-2018T16:40:02,w0lfmare,Some people use god as an excuse to ignore their morals. I don't think that counts as a functional moral compass
15-06-2018T16:40:33,Xexanoth,everything is always depending on the situation so...
15-06-2018T16:40:40,SageSaga,i dont think thats true w0lf
15-06-2018T16:40:49,Xexanoth,wether it's logic or morality
15-06-2018T16:41:05,SageSaga,i dont think people are using God to excuse their ignoring of their morals
15-06-2018T16:41:15,SageSaga,i think they use God to justify their morals
15-06-2018T16:41:52,SageSaga,they arent going out of their way and feeling bad about doing things because God said its ok- they do it because they want to and justify it being Gods will
15-06-2018T16:42:11,SageSaga,people dont have a set of morals we must obey
15-06-2018T16:42:17,SageSaga,we make up our own morals
15-06-2018T16:42:34,SageSaga,and dont confuse Empathy with morals either
15-06-2018T16:42:48,SageSaga,morals dont make you feel bad for breaking them
15-06-2018T16:44:45,SageSaga,far as i can tell there is no moral code that stands up to scrutiny - but a moral code doesnt have to be a strict set of laws- it can change
15-06-2018T16:46:11,SageSaga,lol - though Religion does offer up Moral Codes that they claim cannot be scrutinized because how dare a mere mortal try to say God is wrong XD
15-06-2018T16:47:34,SageSaga,also it may surprise some of you to hear this based on what ive been saying but- im not Atheist
15-06-2018T16:47:42,Ordithus,"Well, that is logically consistent. Though different people adhering to the same professed religion will practice its morals differently"
15-06-2018T16:48:01,Ordithus,Based on their own internal view on morality
15-06-2018T16:48:38,w0lfmare,Well my point is sort of getting lost here. My point is a good civilization is about more than just intelligence
15-06-2018T16:49:33,w0lfmare,"If we were all fine with killing eachother for fun, we wouldn't last very long"
15-06-2018T16:50:44,SageSaga,"i generally define Intelligence as Education - and i generally define Education as being given the tools to properly examine and study an issue or things in a scientific manner. as well as being able to read, write and communicate"
15-06-2018T16:51:27,w0lfmare,I don't think it's wrong to consider a population with a good sense of right and wrong to be important
15-06-2018T16:51:29,SageSaga,"and the basics - Math, Language, Social Studies,  History etc etc"
15-06-2018T16:52:21,SageSaga,i think it's difficult to determine if a society can determine what is right or wrong because its defined by morals-
15-06-2018T16:52:52,SageSaga,a society might think they can tell what right or wrong is but that's from their perspective- you cant properly quantify it
15-06-2018T16:54:19,SageSaga,for example - a society that had a population problem might believe it is morally right to kill every child beyond the 2nd child a family has
15-06-2018T16:54:57,SageSaga,i assume from your perspective- as its mine too- that that would be horrible
15-06-2018T16:55:26,SageSaga,i assume that because i also assume we have similar though im sure differing morals right?
15-06-2018T16:55:46,Ordithus,We are all largely from similar cultures
15-06-2018T16:55:54,Ordithus,(talking about us chatting here)
15-06-2018T16:56:10,Ordithus,I don't think anyone here is into human sacrifice
15-06-2018T16:56:36,SageSaga,(someone do the joke)
15-06-2018T16:58:30,w0lfmare,"There are a lot of moral dilemmas that are hard, if not impossible to solve, but there are easy choices"
15-06-2018T17:00:41,SageSaga,what kind of easy choices?
15-06-2018T17:00:49,SageSaga,because i can make stuff complicated XD
15-06-2018T17:02:21,SageSaga,"""Like would you kill a baby?"" ""Is the baby Hitler? Suddenly it's either really hard or a really easy choice based on your morals!"""
15-06-2018T17:02:28,w0lfmare,Well most sane people consider human life to be valuble
15-06-2018T17:03:21,w0lfmare,"If morals are a scale of right and wrong, there is always going to be a ""greater good"" scenario"
15-06-2018T17:03:31,Ordithus,the greater good
15-06-2018T17:04:18,w0lfmare,"But the things that hold weight for the ""good end"" of the scale are a good place to start"
15-06-2018T17:04:35,SageSaga,i dunno - if we have to put a value on human life doesnt it go down with more people? :P
15-06-2018T17:05:30,SageSaga,all im getting at is Morals arent a solid thing to base things on. That's my point- but! They are VERY important to our society.
15-06-2018T17:06:31,w0lfmare,"Things that let people coexist, like not stealing from or killing neighbors"
15-06-2018T17:06:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Power is back!
15-06-2018T17:07:07,SageSaga,but we can base stuff like that on logic i think
15-06-2018T17:07:35,w0lfmare,"Okay would you feel better if I just said ""logic and empathy""?"
15-06-2018T17:08:00,SageSaga,nope because Empathy has issues too- if we base it on Empathy we cant eat meat anymore!
15-06-2018T17:08:36,Xexanoth,Just by your meat at the supermarket where no animals got harmed *shrug* XD
15-06-2018T17:08:38,w0lfmare,Well that's why you can't have empathy alone :cw0lfmare-KiaHalo:
15-06-2018T17:08:53,w0lfmare,just like you can't have just logic or just intelligence
15-06-2018T17:08:57,Ordithus,"Logic isn't an end goal though.  What does logic have to say about an ""ideal"" society?"
15-06-2018T17:09:05,Ordithus,"It's an incredibly value tool, though."
15-06-2018T17:09:18,SageSaga,like i said- my definition of intelligence is different from IQ
15-06-2018T17:09:38,SageSaga,im honestly not sure i trust IQ as a measurement of int at all
15-06-2018T17:09:46,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s people that have a “plants have feeling too” thing
15-06-2018T17:10:28,SageSaga,yeah but we can prove they dont have the capacity to feel anything XD
15-06-2018T17:11:09,Ordithus,At least they can't fight back
15-06-2018T17:11:18,w0lfmare,I thought we've proven that they can feel pain?
15-06-2018T17:11:23,SageSaga,though i suppose they could believe in a soul like form that can
15-06-2018T17:11:35,SageSaga,they lack a nervous system
15-06-2018T17:12:12,SageSaga,their reactions to outside stimulus is chemical and physical only
15-06-2018T17:12:44,SageSaga,there is no equivalent to a brain for them to process anything like pain
15-06-2018T17:13:04,Ordithus,"Got to go.  Good talk, and the comic is looking nice!  See ya later!"
15-06-2018T17:13:19,SageSaga,take care Ord!
15-06-2018T17:13:34,Ordithus,peace~
15-06-2018T17:14:38,SageSaga,"my main issue with ""it"" is that ""it"" seems to think of everything in life as a Zero-Sum Game"
15-06-2018T17:15:31,SageSaga,which is preposterous in today's society and economy
15-06-2018T17:16:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Justo because they “feel” it doesn’t mean they have understand it
15-06-2018T17:16:35,w0lfmare,"""Still more scientists surmise that plants can exhibit intelligent behavior without possessing a brain or conscious awareness"""
15-06-2018T17:16:50,w0lfmare,Reading an article about it
15-06-2018T17:16:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to say that group of people is just saying it as a joke but
15-06-2018T17:17:16,SpazztasticKiwi,It could also be a very real belief for some
15-06-2018T17:17:30,w0lfmare,I think we don't understand plants well enough to know if they can feel pain
15-06-2018T17:17:49,SageSaga,as we define pain or as i define it- they cannot
15-06-2018T17:18:14,SageSaga,but- if something happens and we prove they can- i will adjust my way of thinking
15-06-2018T17:18:39,RedDragonSyndicate,Hey dude!
15-06-2018T17:18:51,SageSaga,but people claiming that trees scream while on fire because they release gasses - yeah thats a chemical reaction to BURNING XD
15-06-2018T17:19:02,SageSaga,yo Red!
15-06-2018T17:19:25,RedDragonSyndicate,Were you saying something about burning trees? D:
15-06-2018T17:19:30,SageSaga,we are having a Philosophical discussion on morals and intelligence!
15-06-2018T17:19:42,RedDragonSyndicate,Well then. Happy Saturday then
15-06-2018T17:19:58,SageSaga,i know right? My Streams are smartypants
15-06-2018T17:19:59,w0lfmare,"Local scientist discovers brain within tree roots! World asks ""How did we miss that?"""
15-06-2018T17:20:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"For me, intelligence is measured on an individual scale and morals can be studied by looking at individual cultures"
15-06-2018T17:20:42,SageSaga,"""Great- now before we cut down a tree we have to use this device to quickly and effectively kill the trees brain before we cut it down"""
15-06-2018T17:21:38,SageSaga,ha- i did it again- rewrote what i said half way though and made a redundant message
15-06-2018T17:21:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"Generally, of course. I always feel there can be exception(s)"
15-06-2018T17:22:12,SpazztasticKiwi,It came through as understandable
15-06-2018T17:22:58,RedDragonSyndicate,"Dat's a good look'n kitty there, Sage :3"
15-06-2018T17:23:10,SageSaga,she's in EVERY PANEL
15-06-2018T17:23:33,RedDragonSyndicate,So as it should be ;)
15-06-2018T17:26:09,w0lfmare,Exactly Sage
15-06-2018T17:29:30,SpazztasticKiwi,And on morals and such - what can be said about someone who was taught one thing all their life but ended up never believing it?
15-06-2018T17:29:48,SageSaga,depends on what it was
15-06-2018T17:30:09,SageSaga,you can be taught something all your life and it not be a moral so -
15-06-2018T17:31:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I was taught from the youngest age possible not to trust boys
15-06-2018T17:33:09,SageSaga,yeah im not sure if that counts as a moral
15-06-2018T17:33:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Dad told me a lot of odd things
15-06-2018T17:33:37,SpazztasticKiwi,He was paranoid about stuff
15-06-2018T17:36:12,SageSaga,depends on how far he went but Dads are often very protective of their children especially daughters
15-06-2018T17:36:24,SageSaga,it's a trope too
15-06-2018T17:36:51,SpazztasticKiwi,He was mentally ill
15-06-2018T17:37:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Probably a good 90% or so of his reasoning
15-06-2018T17:37:11,SageSaga,brb
15-06-2018T17:37:39,SpazztasticKiwi,He wasn’t fond of doctors either
15-06-2018T17:42:20,SageSaga,back
15-06-2018T17:59:06,RedDragonSyndicate,wb
15-06-2018T18:01:38,SageSaga,I had an idea for a Fathers Day Yosh! Filler but im not sure if i should do it
15-06-2018T18:08:28,w0lfmare,What do your morals tell you?
15-06-2018T18:09:20,SageSaga,hmmm- that some people might take it as insensitive
15-06-2018T18:09:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I really wonder why they took out our Cajun roast beef when it was so popular
15-06-2018T18:10:02,SageSaga,but only because they have been modified to calculate for people that are offended by everything?
15-06-2018T18:10:55,w0lfmare,What's your idea? We can be your control group
15-06-2018T18:11:35,SageSaga,well now i wanna make something up that's like really offensive-
15-06-2018T18:12:22,SageSaga,"just so yall can be like ""Wait- you werent sure about THAT? Holy crap!"""
15-06-2018T18:12:32,MatyMaty,Something really offensive?
15-06-2018T18:12:44,SageSaga,wb
15-06-2018T18:12:46,MatyMaty,Cooked spaguetti with only ketchup as sauce? :v
15-06-2018T18:13:54,Xexanoth,that's jsut normal student food
15-06-2018T18:14:05,SageSaga,that's not only culturally offensive but offensive to my sense of taste and my regret of being unable to eat spaghetti anymore or have ketchup
15-06-2018T18:14:12,MatyMaty,XD
15-06-2018T18:14:55,MatyMaty,"There was also the ""sushi"" made of plain rice balls with a goldfish cookie on top"
15-06-2018T18:15:21,SageSaga,you need to stop
15-06-2018T18:15:47,MatyMaty,Or the margarita made of cheetos soaked in Monster energy drink and
15-06-2018T18:15:54,MatyMaty,I'll stop :P
15-06-2018T18:16:23,SpazztasticKiwi,The spaghetti with ketchup thing was from that honey boo boo thing
15-06-2018T18:16:52,MatyMaty,spaghetti with ketchup is a borderline hate crime
15-06-2018T18:17:11,Xexanoth,...
15-06-2018T18:17:26,SageSaga,i dont know what honey boo boo is but it sounds depressing
15-06-2018T18:17:30,Xexanoth,probably shouldn'T mention how often he eats spaghetti with ketchup
15-06-2018T18:17:43,MatyMaty,Mmmmm
15-06-2018T18:17:48,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, spaghetti sauce is a hate crime by itself"
15-06-2018T18:17:48,MatyMaty,Well Sage imagine
15-06-2018T18:17:50,Bgrmystr2,so there's that
15-06-2018T18:17:56,Bgrmystr2,not sure ketchup is any better
15-06-2018T18:18:01,SageSaga,no
15-06-2018T18:18:02,Bgrmystr2,but I wouldn't eat either.
15-06-2018T18:18:04,SageSaga,lets not imagine
15-06-2018T18:18:16,SageSaga,let's just continue not knowing or thinking about it
15-06-2018T18:18:19,MatyMaty,"children beauty pageants mixed with the most redneck, right leaning american stuff you can"
15-06-2018T18:18:28,MatyMaty,that's Honey Boo Boo
15-06-2018T18:18:39,MatyMaty,aww XD
15-06-2018T18:18:42,SageSaga,that's better
15-06-2018T18:18:45,MatyMaty,I'll shut up :P
15-06-2018T18:19:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Honey boo boo was a spin off of that toddlers and tiaras mess
15-06-2018T18:19:33,MatyMaty,staph
15-06-2018T18:19:43,MatyMaty,Sage has spoken
15-06-2018T18:20:12,Xexanoth,that show was so messed up on every single level
15-06-2018T18:20:18,Mihari,I go off and hunt one dreadqueen and what happens in here!
15-06-2018T18:20:27,MatyMaty,Heya Mihari XD
15-06-2018T18:20:28,SpazztasticKiwi,It focused on one of the families.
15-06-2018T18:20:33,Xexanoth,i still have no idea how the fuck anyone involved in the production went: THis sound like a good idea
15-06-2018T18:20:48,SpazztasticKiwi,They made the south look bad
15-06-2018T18:21:08,Mihari,"Umm, okay..."
15-06-2018T18:21:19,Xexanoth,mihari got hit in the crossfire
15-06-2018T18:21:24,SpazztasticKiwi,What exactly am I doing wrong
15-06-2018T18:21:25,Mihari,I did?
15-06-2018T18:21:30,MatyMaty,she wasn't
15-06-2018T18:21:38,MatyMaty,"Spazz, just drop the subject"
15-06-2018T18:21:41,Mihari,I'm guessing you are talking about something and was already asked to stop.
15-06-2018T18:21:43,SageSaga,my accuracy is unwavering
15-06-2018T18:21:48,MatyMaty,That's enough cringe for a day
15-06-2018T18:21:50,SageSaga,yep
15-06-2018T18:21:53,SpazztasticKiwi,No I wasn’t
15-06-2018T18:21:56,Xexanoth,i was more assuming on the confusion
15-06-2018T18:22:05,Xexanoth,also im really tired
15-06-2018T18:24:37,Bgrmystr2,So I walked away for like a minute and I have no idea wtf you guys did
15-06-2018T18:25:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I was trying to explain something
15-06-2018T18:25:36,SpazztasticKiwi,But nm
15-06-2018T18:25:44,Xexanoth,we talked about terrible thing
15-06-2018T18:26:03,Xexanoth,(mostly an atrocity to mankind but terrible fits too)
15-06-2018T18:26:50,SageSaga,something i said not to explain or discuss
15-06-2018T18:28:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Honey boo boo or unpleasant foods
15-06-2018T18:29:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Well excuse me for asking
15-06-2018T18:30:46,Xexanoth,the message about terrible food are still there if you scroll up so the answer is kinda obvious
15-06-2018T18:31:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"It wasn’t to me at first, so I asked"
15-06-2018T18:31:34,SpazztasticKiwi,But just nm now
15-06-2018T18:39:07,SageSaga,im running out of time
15-06-2018T18:40:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Sage I’m sorry. I don’t mean to be difficult I swear
15-06-2018T18:40:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I just didn’t see right off
15-06-2018T18:42:02,SageSaga,its ok dont worry about it- theres a reason why i was just deleting messages and not banning people- it wasnt a big deal but i did want to stop people from talking about it and i felt deleting the messages would get the point across
15-06-2018T18:42:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m a good noodle :ptv-whiny:
15-06-2018T18:45:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Well anyway enjoy the rest of your stream. I must go - the dishes need me
15-06-2018T18:45:31,SageSaga,take care
15-06-2018T18:55:34,SageSaga,done!
15-06-2018T18:55:37,SageSaga,just in time too
15-06-2018T18:55:39,SageSaga,whew
