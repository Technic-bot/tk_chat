04-03-2018T01:24:43,TheBeckoner,Goodnight y'all and thanks again for the stream Tom. I genuinely enjoy them.
04-03-2018T01:39:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"How come after I say I’m going to bed, it’s like I drank a giant starbucks"
04-03-2018T01:41:28,unsteddyphoenix,Prolly 'cause you had a four hour nap
04-03-2018T01:41:51,unsteddyphoenix,Now im no SLEEP EXPERT
04-03-2018T01:42:09,unsteddyphoenix,But I feel like it's hard to go to bed right after going to bed
04-03-2018T01:50:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I woke up and I was still tired. So I decided to have a snack and then go back to bed. After snack and saying good night: wide awake
04-03-2018T01:51:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I can sleep like the dead. I know this because a tree branch fell on my house once and it woke everyone and everything else up but me
04-03-2018T03:46:05,Dadrobit,"Hmmmmm, eveidentally I was lying when I said ""brb""..."
04-03-2018T03:46:55,Dadrobit,evidentally*
04-03-2018T04:37:40,unsteddyphoenix,its evident
04-03-2018T04:47:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Can’t sleep - salty as my bag of chips
04-03-2018T04:52:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Tea makes it all better. Can’t sleep? Tea. Sick? Tea.
04-03-2018T04:53:39,Dadrobit,"Sick, but no tea."
04-03-2018T04:54:12,Dadrobit,"Sour week. Found out I won't walk at the end of the semester because I missing one class, then I get sick on top of it."
04-03-2018T04:54:14,Dadrobit,No bueno
04-03-2018T04:54:28,Dadrobit,I'm*
04-03-2018T05:03:17,unsteddyphoenix,yoo
04-03-2018T05:03:22,unsteddyphoenix,I had that exact thing happen dad
04-03-2018T05:03:37,unsteddyphoenix,Had one more paper to do before graduating that i didnt realise
04-03-2018T05:03:38,unsteddyphoenix,Feels bad
04-03-2018T05:05:04,unsteddyphoenix,Man yesterday I went to a 21st that was like
04-03-2018T05:05:14,unsteddyphoenix,The richest house ive ever been in
04-03-2018T05:05:25,unsteddyphoenix,"It was absurd, they had like...a sauna and massage room"
04-03-2018T05:05:25,Dadrobit,"The class was supposed to be a first semester thing, but because my professor already waived one other class and gave me a pass on the internship requirement, he couldn't finagle my transcript any more."
04-03-2018T05:05:51,unsteddyphoenix,couldnt triangulate your transcript :(
04-03-2018T05:06:13,unsteddyphoenix,big unlucky
04-03-2018T05:06:25,Dadrobit,"So he told me, ""Take it online over the summer and cheat til your heart's content."""
04-03-2018T05:06:51,Dadrobit,"finagle, not find-angle"
04-03-2018T05:07:11,unsteddyphoenix,Aha
04-03-2018T05:07:24,unsteddyphoenix,did you many cheat?
04-03-2018T05:07:25,Dadrobit,"So here I am, three years in, taking music theory I..."
04-03-2018T05:07:58,Dadrobit,I don't understand that sentence.
04-03-2018T05:08:15,unsteddyphoenix,"Sorry, I mean"
04-03-2018T05:08:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I had a teacher try to tell me I wasn’t graduating this year despite the advisor telling me that this semester would be my last
04-03-2018T05:08:35,unsteddyphoenix,Did you disingenuously excel through dishonourable means?
04-03-2018T05:09:11,Dadrobit,"Naw, haven't cheated in any of my classes thus far. And I probably won't have to do so to get through this one either."
04-03-2018T05:09:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"When she went back through my credits and recounted them, she saw she’d missed a class"
04-03-2018T05:09:37,unsteddyphoenix,Oof
04-03-2018T05:09:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I now have my diploma
04-03-2018T05:09:57,Dadrobit,Good stuff... Can't wait...
04-03-2018T05:10:19,unsteddyphoenix,You can DO it.
04-03-2018T05:10:55,Dadrobit,"Yeah, just not by the end of the semester is all."
04-03-2018T05:12:38,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s successful people without degrees and old people getting their degrees
04-03-2018T05:12:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Live life on your own timeline
04-03-2018T05:13:19,Dadrobit,"I don't really need it by any means, I just waaaaanntt it. Fucked up so many times before, I just wanna say that I finally completed it."
04-03-2018T05:13:42,SpazztasticKiwi,“Take that society”
04-03-2018T05:14:09,Dadrobit,S'gonna take me until I'm 26 to get a 2 year certification. feelsbadman
04-03-2018T05:14:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Eh 26 ain’t old
04-03-2018T05:14:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"He’ll, 30 isn’t very old either"
04-03-2018T05:22:19,unsteddyphoenix,Optimism~
04-03-2018T05:22:28,unsteddyphoenix,Took me longer to do my degree too
04-03-2018T05:22:43,unsteddyphoenix,Though that was more to me being trash and noone elses fault~
04-03-2018T05:24:06,unsteddyphoenix,Its hard to not compare yoself to others :/
04-03-2018T05:27:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Especially when it’s someone younger with better success
04-03-2018T05:28:31,Dadrobit,"Nah, for me it's always comparing to my pops. Dude's a legit genius, I missed out on it."
04-03-2018T05:28:51,SpazztasticKiwi,But you have to factor out all the variables in their and your circumstances
04-03-2018T05:29:27,Dadrobit,"He paid for his Masters degree by himself, I gave up my full ride scholarships to play video games and party."
04-03-2018T05:30:01,Dadrobit,I am not a smart man
04-03-2018T05:30:40,SpazztasticKiwi,My dad’s dad owns his own business. My dad never completed high school I don’t believe
04-03-2018T05:31:30,SpazztasticKiwi,And my dad’s brother is someone no one wants to particularly meet
04-03-2018T05:33:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"But his two sisters, while not terribly successful per say, are living happy and well"
04-03-2018T05:34:05,SpazztasticKiwi,They were all raised in the same atmosphere. It’s all in how you do you
04-03-2018T05:35:59,unsteddyphoenix,Better than racking up loans pointlessly
04-03-2018T05:37:11,unsteddyphoenix,"Im kind of a fuckup, but just gotta focus on myself I suppose~"
04-03-2018T05:37:14,Dadrobit,"I very firmly believe in ""you do you"". But for me, I've in recent years started demanding more of myself, and I think it's very much for the better."
04-03-2018T05:37:33,unsteddyphoenix,something something at your own pace
04-03-2018T05:37:50,Dadrobit,Didn't want to end up being 55 yrs old working in the same security booth punch my 40 a week.
04-03-2018T05:37:58,Dadrobit,punching*
04-03-2018T05:38:17,unsteddyphoenix,Man imagine how you couldve climbed the security ranks!
04-03-2018T05:38:39,Dadrobit,"Even though the money was good and the job was safe-ish, I just dreaded that outcome."
04-03-2018T05:39:02,Dadrobit,I already did man. Made Master Security Officer in my first 8 months.
04-03-2018T05:39:08,Dadrobit,There was no where else to go.
04-03-2018T05:39:44,Dadrobit,Just wait for the raises to come every 6 months and watch Game Grumps all night.
04-03-2018T05:40:05,unsteddyphoenix,MASTER security officer?
04-03-2018T05:40:14,unsteddyphoenix,Loathe to give up that badass title
04-03-2018T05:40:19,Dadrobit,MSO level 5 in fact.
04-03-2018T05:40:33,unsteddyphoenix,Is that job an RPG
04-03-2018T05:40:58,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I waited around, pressed a few buttons, and the numbers in my bank account kept going up."
04-03-2018T05:41:14,unsteddyphoenix,sounds like the dream tbh
04-03-2018T05:42:20,Dadrobit,"So long as you can deal with pretentious rich fucks, sure. But do it for a couple years, it gets old real quick."
04-03-2018T05:42:54,unsteddyphoenix,I can see that
04-03-2018T05:43:14,Dadrobit,"Throw in 18+ hour days over the weekends and a complete lack of social life from working the graveyards, and it just got to me."
04-03-2018T05:43:54,Dadrobit,Especially seeing the other officers who ~were~ 50+ and were just on autopilot through life at that job.
04-03-2018T05:44:01,unsteddyphoenix,Social life? Isnt that what the internet is for?
04-03-2018T05:45:30,unsteddyphoenix,Surprised people can do something like that for so long
04-03-2018T05:45:37,Dadrobit,"Sure. you can always catch up with friends over the internet, but it doesn't feel so great when you miss family parties because getting a weekend off is impossible."
04-03-2018T05:45:51,unsteddyphoenix,Thats true your grandma throws the best parties~
04-03-2018T05:45:54,Dadrobit,It was a no-brain job. Literally.
04-03-2018T05:46:09,Dadrobit,Hell yeah she does
04-03-2018T05:46:52,Dadrobit,"There were nights where the only people I'd see were the cleaning ladies coming in at 10, and the newspaper lady at 4."
04-03-2018T05:47:18,Dadrobit,"Easy, but mind numbing."
04-03-2018T05:47:58,unsteddyphoenix,bet you went through a lotta books or whatever
04-03-2018T05:48:20,Dadrobit,From Dune to the collections of amenon
04-03-2018T05:49:32,unsteddyphoenix,lmao
04-03-2018T05:56:54,Dadrobit,Still need to finish her newer stuff
04-03-2018T06:04:04,unsteddyphoenix,Smut as far as the eye can see
04-03-2018T06:05:06,Dadrobit,"LOL. Watching a military video. Soldier 1 ""We were pinned, we were pinned sir."" Soldier 2 ""We weren't pinned! We were just getting shot at by everyone."" Soldier 3 ""Pew Pew."""
04-03-2018T06:06:40,unsteddyphoenix,So it's educational
04-03-2018T06:06:42,unsteddyphoenix,Is what im getting
04-03-2018T06:07:46,Dadrobit,Hilarious at least. I was an A-10 strafing run on a treeline. Made the treeline vanish.
04-03-2018T06:08:39,Dadrobit,It*
04-03-2018T06:09:20,unsteddyphoenix,"""boom boom"""
04-03-2018T06:10:43,Dadrobit,BRRRRRRRT*
04-03-2018T06:13:24,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: None of this Avenger shenaniganry
04-03-2018T06:14:21,Bgrmystr2,"no srsly tho, the Avenger is a fucking monster"
04-03-2018T06:14:44,Bgrmystr2,One of the few weapons I'd like to fire first-hand at least once in my life.
04-03-2018T08:50:24,Barabashe4ka,Hello everybody
04-03-2018T09:10:37,NightMeaty22,Good morning
04-03-2018T09:50:07,TheBeckoner,For the first time in months I just got 8 hours of sleep...feels nice.
04-03-2018T12:48:42,Barabashe4ka,Congratulation on an 8-hour sleep)
04-03-2018T13:55:13,NightMeaty22,Hello
04-03-2018T18:09:40,TheArtApprentice,hi
04-03-2018T18:12:32,TheArtApprentice,whats the diff between OBS and strealabs OBS?
04-03-2018T18:12:42,TheArtApprentice,*Streamlabs
04-03-2018T18:15:52,Bgrmystr2,"Streamlabs is a fork of OBS Studio, basically"
04-03-2018T18:16:40,Bgrmystr2,OBS Studio is open-source
04-03-2018T18:17:06,Bgrmystr2,So a bunch of people took that source and made Streamlabs
04-03-2018T18:17:40,Bgrmystr2,"I haven't used Streamlabs myself, so I don't know what all it has to offer, but from what I've seen it doesn't look all that much different from OBS Studio yet"
04-03-2018T18:18:05,Bgrmystr2,"given time, they'll likely be putting more and more stuff into it that differenciates it from the core OBS program"
04-03-2018T18:18:54,Bgrmystr2,you can check out what streamlabs has here https://streamlabs.com/features
04-03-2018T18:20:52,TheGamePlayer,ok thanks Im downloading stream labs right now
04-03-2018T18:21:17,Bgrmystr2,"Apparently, Streamlabs was already a thing that existed"
04-03-2018T18:21:25,TheGamePlayer,ah
04-03-2018T18:21:35,Bgrmystr2,and they took OBS as a source because it was new
04-03-2018T18:21:41,Bgrmystr2,and implemented all the streamlab stuff into it
04-03-2018T18:21:54,TheGamePlayer,totally didnt change accounts or any thing
04-03-2018T18:21:56,Bgrmystr2,I've never heard of streamlabs before they fused with OBS so I dunno what they had before
04-03-2018T18:22:09,Bgrmystr2,I totally didn't notice you doing that or anything
04-03-2018T18:22:14,TheGamePlayer,ima try stream labs
04-03-2018T18:22:26,Bgrmystr2,good luck :thumbsup:
04-03-2018T18:22:29,TheGamePlayer,im did so so I could stream my games
04-03-2018T18:22:35,TheGamePlayer,*I
04-03-2018T18:23:45,TheGamePlayer,Good Afternoon Tom.
04-03-2018T18:36:04,TheGamePlayer,my pc doesnt like streamlabs so ima just go back to OBS
04-03-2018T18:40:24,Bgrmystr2,"It's not gonna be any different than OBS, you probably just need to set it up properly"
04-03-2018T18:42:09,TheGamePlayer,ya but my software stuff say that streamlabs is harmful but regular OBS isnt
04-03-2018T18:42:57,Bgrmystr2,your software stuff will probably be wrong :P
04-03-2018T18:43:03,TheGamePlayer,and I dont like to take risks
04-03-2018T18:43:22,TheGamePlayer,you mean is or be?
04-03-2018T18:43:37,TheGamePlayer,its chrome it self that says it
04-03-2018T18:43:40,Bgrmystr2,there's nothing on streamlabs that would harm your pc if you got it off the site
04-03-2018T18:44:00,TheGamePlayer,ima just use obs
04-03-2018T18:44:11,Bgrmystr2,"if I meant is, I would have typed is. :u"
04-03-2018T18:44:24,Bgrmystr2,and that'd be incorrect wording anyway
04-03-2018T18:44:27,Bgrmystr2,so I didn't
04-03-2018T18:45:09,Bgrmystr2,"if the chrome you have is saying there's something wrong with streamlabs obs, that means you're probably already infected with something to begin with"
04-03-2018T18:45:16,Bgrmystr2,and it's just attaching to anything you download
04-03-2018T18:47:52,TheGamePlayer,no its only streamlabs.
04-03-2018T18:48:54,Bgrmystr2,wouldn't matter if it's only appearing on one download or all of them
04-03-2018T18:49:37,Bgrmystr2,it's running fine on my pc o.O
04-03-2018T18:50:56,Bgrmystr2,there's literally nothing wrong with it https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/250139544517607424/420367565458636800/Streamlabs_OBS_2018-03-05_17-50-26.png
04-03-2018T18:50:58,TheGamePlayer,maybe it could be do to the 3 different things on here that scan for stuff iv had this happen befor with a steam game Subnautica and it fixed it self later on
04-03-2018T18:52:40,TheGamePlayer,yep
04-03-2018T18:52:44,TheGamePlayer,fixed it
04-03-2018T18:52:49,Bgrmystr2,lolo
04-03-2018T18:52:51,Bgrmystr2,there ya go see
04-03-2018T19:00:41,TheGamePlayer,nice I got a decent stream going too that bit rate is very low though
04-03-2018T19:03:10,Bgrmystr2,"that's gonna be in the options, you can change that"
04-03-2018T19:04:22,TheGamePlayer,I know i turned it down to actually be able to have a no lagy stream
04-03-2018T19:08:25,Bgrmystr2,what resolution are you uploading at what bitratre?
04-03-2018T19:13:42,TheGamePlayer,400
04-03-2018T19:13:53,TheGamePlayer,and
04-03-2018T19:14:27,TheGamePlayer,1920x1080 base canvas
04-03-2018T19:14:43,TheGamePlayer,1280x720 output scaled
04-03-2018T19:14:45,Bgrmystr2,what games are you streaming with that
04-03-2018T19:14:55,TheGamePlayer,kerbals space program
04-03-2018T19:14:58,TheGamePlayer,fallout 4
04-03-2018T19:15:04,TheGamePlayer,and whatnot
04-03-2018T19:15:13,TheGamePlayer,big games
04-03-2018T19:15:17,Bgrmystr2,that's a really fucking bad setup for FPS
04-03-2018T19:15:24,TheGamePlayer,yep
04-03-2018T19:15:32,Bgrmystr2,FPS need high bitrate or you won't see anything anyway
04-03-2018T19:15:41,TheGamePlayer,then my stream lags
04-03-2018T19:15:54,TheGamePlayer,you can see stuff its just a bit blurry
04-03-2018T19:15:57,Bgrmystr2,you should lower the resolution and increase the bitrate for FPS and other games with lots of movement
04-03-2018T19:16:14,TheGamePlayer,aww
04-03-2018T19:16:30,Bgrmystr2,and for stuff without high movement you can have a higher resolution with a lower bitrate
04-03-2018T19:16:55,Bgrmystr2,cuz bitrate is mostly focused on keeping as much quality on your screen all the time
04-03-2018T19:17:15,Bgrmystr2,that's why artists have a high res but don't need a lot of bitrate
04-03-2018T19:17:15,TheGamePlayer,well I just dropped the canvas scale
04-03-2018T19:17:42,TheGamePlayer,tbh i have no fucking clue what im doing
04-03-2018T19:17:59,Bgrmystr2,lool
04-03-2018T19:18:12,TheGamePlayer,1500 bit rate hows that sound?
04-03-2018T19:18:52,Bgrmystr2,"1500 is standard, but that may be a lot for your net speed"
04-03-2018T19:18:59,Bgrmystr2,do you know how fast your upload speed is?
04-03-2018T19:19:31,Bgrmystr2,you may not be able to push 1500 even with a smaller resolution if your net isn't fast enough
04-03-2018T19:19:33,TheGamePlayer,let me see
04-03-2018T19:22:03,TheGamePlayer,around 0.51 MB
04-03-2018T19:22:38,TheGamePlayer,download is 8 mb
04-03-2018T19:22:40,Bgrmystr2,how did you manage to get that low of a speed
04-03-2018T19:22:54,TheGamePlayer,I moved to the middle of no where
04-03-2018T19:23:08,Bgrmystr2,are you using speedtest?
04-03-2018T19:23:16,TheGamePlayer,yes
04-03-2018T19:23:58,TheGamePlayer,OOPS\
04-03-2018T19:24:01,TheGamePlayer,OOOOPSSS
04-03-2018T19:24:03,TheGamePlayer,OH NOOO
04-03-2018T19:24:04,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, I dunno how the hell you think you're gonna stream with that slow of a net speed"
04-03-2018T19:24:11,TheGamePlayer,AHHHHH
04-03-2018T19:24:14,TheGamePlayer,NO NO NO
04-03-2018T19:24:18,TheGamePlayer,shit
04-03-2018T19:24:23,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
04-03-2018T19:24:38,TheGamePlayer,i clicked on something and sent malware to me
04-03-2018T19:24:54,Bgrmystr2,doesn't have active protection why?
04-03-2018T19:25:04,TheGamePlayer,i do
04-03-2018T19:25:16,Bgrmystr2,then you should be fine
04-03-2018T19:25:20,Bgrmystr2,why so worried
04-03-2018T19:25:28,TheGamePlayer,Idk
04-03-2018T19:26:47,TheGamePlayer,google got rid of it before my protection did
04-03-2018T19:28:04,TheGamePlayer,my ping is 20 though
04-03-2018T19:28:13,Bgrmystr2,"I wouldn't trust google to find itself out of a brown paper bag, nevermind telling me what is malware"
04-03-2018T19:28:13,TheGamePlayer,is that good?
04-03-2018T19:28:24,Bgrmystr2,20 ping isn't bad
04-03-2018T19:28:33,Bgrmystr2,but your upload is damn slow
04-03-2018T19:28:42,Bgrmystr2,"so you won't likely be doing very well streaming anything, honestly"
04-03-2018T19:28:51,Bgrmystr2,you need a faster upload
04-03-2018T19:29:28,TheGamePlayer,our provider will upgrade its area up here in a year or so so that may help
04-03-2018T19:29:34,Bgrmystr2,"I've got an 11 mbit upload, or so from my speedtests"
04-03-2018T19:29:51,TheGamePlayer,dang
04-03-2018T19:29:56,Bgrmystr2,and I can probably just barely stream FPS at 1080p with 1200 bitrate
04-03-2018T19:30:22,Bgrmystr2,"not even 1500, though it's my processor that slows everything down"
04-03-2018T19:30:30,TheGamePlayer,I made my audio mute and that seems to help some how
04-03-2018T19:30:44,Bgrmystr2,audio is a very small part of the stream upload
04-03-2018T19:30:47,TheGamePlayer,does delaying do any thing?
04-03-2018T19:31:00,Bgrmystr2,other than doing what it says on the tin? No
04-03-2018T19:31:09,Bgrmystr2,it just delays your stream
04-03-2018T19:31:31,Bgrmystr2,"if you delay it 5 seconds, then it'll show up 5 seconds later than normal, that's it"
04-03-2018T19:32:04,TheGamePlayer,XD ok
04-03-2018T19:32:47,TheGamePlayer,the encoder preset higher = less cpu does that help if set to ultra?
04-03-2018T19:32:57,TheGamePlayer,for audio
04-03-2018T19:33:47,Bgrmystr2,I'm actually not sure. :thinking:
04-03-2018T19:34:01,Bgrmystr2,"My processor is rather slow for a streaming setup, it's not built for it"
04-03-2018T19:34:09,Bgrmystr2,so I tend to push a lot of my rendering to my GPU
04-03-2018T19:34:11,Bgrmystr2,and it works
04-03-2018T19:34:21,Bgrmystr2,but my audio isn't a problem
04-03-2018T19:34:57,Bgrmystr2,all of my audio bitrates are 160
04-03-2018T19:36:15,TheGamePlayer,im going to try to desize the game window on the stream
04-03-2018T19:36:43,Bgrmystr2,that won't really change anything
04-03-2018T19:37:01,TheGamePlayer,and im getting a solid kb/s of 500-580 and its green
04-03-2018T19:37:11,Bgrmystr2,making it smaller on the stream screen won't actually change how much you're uploading
04-03-2018T19:37:18,TheGamePlayer,hmmm
04-03-2018T19:37:28,Bgrmystr2,and it's better to have it fully screened anyway
04-03-2018T19:37:40,Bgrmystr2,and just use a smaller resolution if you want to make it smaller
04-03-2018T19:37:50,TheGamePlayer,as long as this thing is green that means no lag?
04-03-2018T19:38:40,Bgrmystr2,I don't know I haven't streamed with streamlabs before XD
04-03-2018T19:38:55,Bgrmystr2,it'll probably show dropped frames though
04-03-2018T19:38:56,TheGamePlayer,oh no its just OBS
04-03-2018T19:39:10,TheGamePlayer,0 dropped frames
04-03-2018T19:39:17,Bgrmystr2,I dunno I don't get any green anything using OBS
04-03-2018T19:39:24,Bgrmystr2,when streaming
04-03-2018T19:40:07,TheGamePlayer,at the very bottom right? there should be a little box that tell the kb/s mb/s gb/s meter
04-03-2018T19:40:19,TheGamePlayer,gigbites would be nice
04-03-2018T19:40:58,Bgrmystr2,"All I've got down there is Live time, recording time, CPU usage, and FPS"
04-03-2018T19:41:01,Bgrmystr2,nothing else
04-03-2018T19:41:44,TheGamePlayer,are you streaming?
04-03-2018T19:42:01,Bgrmystr2,no? :o
04-03-2018T19:42:07,TheGamePlayer,then thats why
04-03-2018T19:42:31,Bgrmystr2,xD
04-03-2018T19:42:55,TheGamePlayer,love how you went from teaching me to me teaching you
04-03-2018T19:43:34,Bgrmystr2,"I don't stream with OBS all that often, but it's not like you've told me something I didn't know. I don't get the same thing you do lol"
04-03-2018T19:44:07,Bgrmystr2,probably because the UI for 7 in classic mode is different than what you're using
04-03-2018T19:44:08,TheGamePlayer,update?
04-03-2018T19:44:41,Bgrmystr2,"update what, OBS or OS? :o"
04-03-2018T19:46:11,TheGamePlayer,obs
04-03-2018T19:46:51,Bgrmystr2,ah I haven't updated OBS since it the new update was causing the constantly checking for update loop and bluescreening computers because of it
04-03-2018T19:47:08,Bgrmystr2,"they said they'd fix it, and then I forgot to check for updates"
04-03-2018T19:47:10,Bgrmystr2,:u
04-03-2018T19:47:31,Bgrmystr2,that was... I dunno
04-03-2018T19:47:37,Bgrmystr2,a bit ago I guess
04-03-2018T19:47:53,TheGamePlayer,lol
04-03-2018T19:47:58,Bgrmystr2,I'm still on 20.1.0
04-03-2018T19:48:17,TheGamePlayer,i have the newest version do to me reinstalling it seems fine
04-03-2018T20:06:35,Bgrmystr2,ahh this is definitely new
04-03-2018T20:07:03,Bgrmystr2,it shows audio for each side
04-03-2018T20:07:06,Bgrmystr2,that's cool
04-03-2018T20:18:36,TheGamePlayer,youd thing 7 Goalkeepers aka anti air guns would bring down a vehicle assembly building
04-03-2018T20:18:49,TheGamePlayer,50 cal bullets
04-03-2018T20:18:54,TheGamePlayer,from 7 of them
04-03-2018T20:20:31,Bgrmystr2,"mm, no"
04-03-2018T20:20:34,Bgrmystr2,depends on the building
04-03-2018T20:20:45,Bgrmystr2,buildings have lots of support
04-03-2018T20:20:55,Bgrmystr2,and can stand even when severely damaged
04-03-2018T20:22:39,TheGamePlayer,welp I proved missiles are affective
04-03-2018T20:23:10,TheGamePlayer,im exerimenting with a mod I got for KSP
04-03-2018T20:23:24,TheGamePlayer,*experimenting
04-03-2018T20:33:48,TheGamePlayer,oh dear I wonder how fallout 4 will do
04-03-2018T20:34:13,TheGamePlayer,not bad
04-03-2018T21:44:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Someone tell me a funny story
04-03-2018T21:44:35,TheBeckoner,Ur life
04-03-2018T21:44:38,TheBeckoner,huehuehuehue
04-03-2018T21:44:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"No, seriously"
04-03-2018T21:44:53,TheBeckoner,Im too boring for that sorta thing
04-03-2018T21:45:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I just saw a video reporting on two men that dragged a kitten behind their truck to death
04-03-2018T21:48:24,SpazztasticKiwi,The only consolidation I have is that it’s not being tortured anymore
04-03-2018T21:48:50,TheBeckoner,Awww why sad things...
04-03-2018T21:49:04,TheBeckoner,Dont let Steddy see that...I think he likes cats
04-03-2018T21:50:42,SpazztasticKiwi,So do I - I have two
04-03-2018T21:51:20,TheBeckoner,I like them but I am allergic.
04-03-2018T21:51:37,TheBeckoner,Doesnt stop me from dispensing pets tho.
04-03-2018T21:51:57,SpazztasticKiwi,But you don’t laugh at their torture. That’s the difference
04-03-2018T21:53:57,TheBeckoner,I certainly don't do that...
04-03-2018T21:54:10,TheBeckoner,evil people are mean to animals
04-03-2018T21:56:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"My cats are taught what’s acceptable and what’s not, but they’ll still knock over a plant. Cats are an adventure"
04-03-2018T21:56:58,TheBeckoner,They live to destroy and receive pampering.
04-03-2018T21:57:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"Especially Bagheera. “Don’t get in that”. When I come back, he’s got potting soul in his fur and needs a bath"
04-03-2018T21:57:36,SpazztasticKiwi,*soil
04-03-2018T21:57:45,TheBeckoner,Just give him a big tube of it!
04-03-2018T21:57:50,TheBeckoner,tub*
04-03-2018T21:58:30,SpazztasticKiwi,He doesn’t need a tub of dirt to play in. He makes enough messes without being a walking dirt dispenser
04-03-2018T21:59:25,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s like a small child - silence is suspicious
04-03-2018T22:00:05,TheBeckoner,Thats how pigs are. No unks? Something has been destroyed.
04-03-2018T22:00:44,SpazztasticKiwi,“Why are you quiet? What are you into?”
04-03-2018T22:01:39,TheBeckoner,pretty much
04-03-2018T22:01:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Story of pet ownership
04-03-2018T22:02:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless it’s fish
04-03-2018T22:06:01,TheBeckoner,"""Why are you quiet?!...oh you're always quiet...that's right"""
04-03-2018T22:06:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Bunnies and hedgehogs don’t really make alot of noise either do they?
04-03-2018T22:07:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Or chinchillas
04-03-2018T22:08:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"I know mice, rats, hamsters, gerbils and guinea pigs do"
04-03-2018T22:08:25,SpazztasticKiwi,And birds
04-03-2018T22:10:02,TheBeckoner,Nah we have bunnys. They only make noise when they wanna make babies...
04-03-2018T22:10:06,TheBeckoner,bunnies*
04-03-2018T22:10:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"I think buns are cute, but I don’t think I’d really get"
04-03-2018T22:11:01,TheBeckoner,Lots of maintenance.
04-03-2018T22:11:19,SpazztasticKiwi,And they’re delicate
04-03-2018T22:11:31,TheBeckoner,I've had guinea pigs and hamsters too. A rat as well. It didn't really make any sounds either.
04-03-2018T22:11:42,TheBeckoner,Probably as delicate as a hamster
04-03-2018T22:12:00,TheBeckoner,The large bunnies are more like a cat or small dog though
04-03-2018T22:12:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"My hamsters only made noises with their chewing and running wheels, like the gerbils and guinea is pigs"
04-03-2018T22:13:28,SpazztasticKiwi,My sister had the rat when I was either no born yet or really young
04-03-2018T22:13:44,SpazztasticKiwi,They got rid of him because he attracted wild rats
04-03-2018T22:13:51,TheBeckoner,Mmm
04-03-2018T22:13:56,TheBeckoner,We had a female
04-03-2018T22:14:15,TheBeckoner,"very cool pet, but she had a seizure unfortunately."
04-03-2018T22:14:37,TheBeckoner,And guinea pigs scream when they want things lol
04-03-2018T22:15:10,SpazztasticKiwi,One of my hamsters had a seizure. I also had one that we discovered was deaf
04-03-2018T22:15:37,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s why she kept getting returned to the pet store
04-03-2018T22:17:24,TheBeckoner,huh weird. Never seen a deaf hamster
04-03-2018T22:17:35,TheBeckoner,What gave it away?
04-03-2018T22:17:50,TheBeckoner,Just unresponsive?
04-03-2018T22:18:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"She didn’t react to noises (no ear twitching, turning towards noise)"
04-03-2018T22:18:37,SpazztasticKiwi,The only way to get her attention was vibrating the cage door by tapping it
04-03-2018T22:19:39,SpazztasticKiwi,The families that had her said she was bitey. Probably because they were touching or picking her up when she had no idea they were there
04-03-2018T22:20:00,TheBeckoner,Makes sense
04-03-2018T22:21:00,SpazztasticKiwi,She was docile if she knew you were there. She’d come up to the cage doors if you tapped them and take a treat from your fingers no problem
04-03-2018T22:22:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve adopted quite a few “reject/returned” pets from stores
04-03-2018T22:27:50,TheBeckoner,We tend to pick up dogs from the street or wild. We have 3 dogs from various situations right now. We've rescued a few goats too you could say. And one pig I guess...
04-03-2018T22:28:43,TheBeckoner,All of our rodents were bought or needed new homes from other owners I think...memory is a bit fuzzy
04-03-2018T22:28:50,TheBeckoner,Literally lol
04-03-2018T22:36:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Goats have to be one of the funniest creatures
04-03-2018T22:37:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Particularly pygmy goats
04-03-2018T22:42:41,SpazztasticKiwi,And PAX just announced that the list of entertainers going will be posted likely some time tomorrow
04-03-2018T22:47:52,TheBeckoner,Lucky me I have 5 pygmy goats
04-03-2018T22:47:55,TheBeckoner,4*
04-03-2018T22:48:24,TheBeckoner,"When they go into heat is the funniest thing. They all make a noise similar to ""wut wut wut"""
04-03-2018T22:48:34,TheBeckoner,pretty hilarious actually
04-03-2018T22:59:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d like to know how being excited causes them to skip sideways
04-03-2018T22:59:36,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s like they’re so jittery they don’t know what to do with themselves
04-03-2018T23:01:40,TheBeckoner,They do do that as well. Usually in the spring or whenever its 60's and sunny
04-03-2018T23:01:46,TheBeckoner,(Not often here)
04-03-2018T23:02:21,TheBeckoner,"One of them is from africa, so she really like mild cool temps"
04-03-2018T23:02:26,TheBeckoner,likes*
04-03-2018T23:02:42,Glavous,Hello
04-03-2018T23:05:14,TheBeckoner,Hello
04-03-2018T23:05:53,Glavous,What's going on?
04-03-2018T23:11:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m rewatching Mark’s livestream from Christmas
04-03-2018T23:12:21,TheBeckoner,Im doing trig homework
04-03-2018T23:15:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Ew
04-03-2018T23:16:06,SpazztasticKiwi,This stream...
04-03-2018T23:17:08,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s the one where their mom tells Mark to pipe down because Toms still asleep. And then they have a debate because apparently their mom cooks human food for her dogs
04-03-2018T23:26:51,SpazztasticKiwi,How’s the homework?
04-03-2018T23:26:51,Glavous,¿
04-03-2018T23:30:05,Glavous,Lol timing
04-03-2018T23:45:42,TheBeckoner,Link to that stream?
04-03-2018T23:45:54,TheBeckoner,And goin good. Thanks for asking.
