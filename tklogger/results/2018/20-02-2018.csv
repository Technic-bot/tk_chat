20-02-2018T00:00:17,unsteddyphoenix,Aligns with your interests~
20-02-2018T00:00:25,Twokinds,lol
20-02-2018T00:00:47,Twokinds,I don't like paperwork. But I do like tax deductions!
20-02-2018T00:01:01,Twokinds,And numbers going up.
20-02-2018T00:01:04,Twokinds,That's why I like RPGs.
20-02-2018T00:01:38,unsteddyphoenix,I guess I see the relation
20-02-2018T00:01:53,unsteddyphoenix,BIG numbers
20-02-2018T00:02:04,unsteddyphoenix,Borderlands was good for that
20-02-2018T00:02:10,unsteddyphoenix,If you play that type of game
20-02-2018T00:03:28,wolfspartan1,"i think borderlands 1 was ""free"" on xbox a while back"
20-02-2018T00:03:50,Bgrmystr2,yeh BL1 had a good set of number values
20-02-2018T00:04:02,Bgrmystr2,2 just went bugger all insane
20-02-2018T00:04:11,Bgrmystr2,but 1 was a nice balance
20-02-2018T00:04:34,Twokinds,"Finances are just rpg irl. Just gotta grind, and use the systems to automate the process."
20-02-2018T00:04:59,Twokinds,I did like bl1 and 2
20-02-2018T00:05:50,unsteddyphoenix,Thats a good way to think about it

20-02-2018T00:39:47,SpazztasticKiwi,That makes me wonder how Flora would react to a house cat
20-02-2018T00:40:16,unsteddyphoenix,There are normal cats in twokinds tho
20-02-2018T00:40:36,unsteddyphoenix,Do keidran keep cats and dogs as pets? :thinking:

20-02-2018T00:45:05,unsteddyphoenix,Mines pretty long but it's still curly so
20-02-2018T00:45:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I used to have really long hair but cut it to my shoulders. Curls are more obvious now
20-02-2018T00:45:27,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe we just all have the same hair :thinking:
20-02-2018T00:45:36,unsteddyphoenix,I wanna have hella long hair like Tom~

20-02-2018T00:47:04,Dadrobit,Is that how females work?
20-02-2018T00:47:06,TheBeckoner,I also have nipples?
20-02-2018T00:47:11,unsteddyphoenix,Females do have nipples
20-02-2018T00:47:12,TheBeckoner,I think so

20-02-2018T00:47:17,TheBeckoner,I must be female
20-02-2018T00:47:21,Dadrobit,Clearly
20-02-2018T00:47:27,NightMeaty22,...
20-02-2018T00:47:29,TheBeckoner,I also have a butt
20-02-2018T00:47:31,TheBeckoner,soooo
20-02-2018T00:47:34,Dadrobit,Ohhhhhh~

20-02-2018T00:47:37,NightMeaty22,...
20-02-2018T00:47:56,TheBeckoner,and long hair
20-02-2018T00:48:00,TheBeckoner,&gt;Confirmed
20-02-2018T00:48:05,unsteddyphoenix,It's all adding up.
20-02-2018T00:48:12,TheBeckoner,"we aren't the same person, just female."
20-02-2018T00:48:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Can you concieve or carry a child?
20-02-2018T00:48:40,Dadrobit,"Shit, this reminds me of a story back in college with a stoner buddy of mine who was convinced he was turning into a butterfly because his skin was falling off."
20-02-2018T00:48:53,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe I could if I tried.
20-02-2018T00:48:56,TheBeckoner,lol wut
20-02-2018T00:48:58,Dadrobit,(It was just a sunburn peeling)

20-02-2018T00:49:09,Dadrobit,We were reaaaaaaalllly high at the time.
20-02-2018T00:49:20,TheBeckoner,I bet lol
20-02-2018T00:49:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I guess the definition is a little loose. Technically you could become female if you wanted
20-02-2018T00:49:41,Dadrobit,I don't think concieving/carrying a child is mandatory tho.
20-02-2018T00:49:53,TheBeckoner,I tried weed once. did not end well
20-02-2018T00:49:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Thank god

20-02-2018T00:50:26,TheBeckoner,Logically.
20-02-2018T00:50:43,Dadrobit,"Next you'll be all up on Natani, and then Alaric!"
20-02-2018T00:50:48,NightMeaty22,😑
20-02-2018T00:50:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder if surrogate mothers are a thing
20-02-2018T00:51:03,Dadrobit,Yes
20-02-2018T00:51:16,Dadrobit,"Oh, wait, you mean in comic?"
20-02-2018T00:51:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Yep; she could have a kid then
20-02-2018T00:51:43,NightMeaty22,☻
20-02-2018T00:51:44,TheBeckoner,Im all good being all up on Alaric.
20-02-2018T00:51:45,Dadrobit,"Naw, that's just an advanced form of adopting."
20-02-2018T00:51:52,unsteddyphoenix,Have you finished reading it btw?
20-02-2018T00:52:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m caught up

20-02-2018T00:52:19,unsteddyphoenix,favourite chara?
20-02-2018T00:52:37,Dadrobit,"Alaric literally has turned people gay, I've seen it with my own pixels."
20-02-2018T00:52:49,Dadrobit,TY Beck
20-02-2018T00:52:53,TheBeckoner,This is irrefutably true.
20-02-2018T00:53:14,SpazztasticKiwi,It is a dead tie between Flora and Kat
20-02-2018T00:53:17,unsteddyphoenix,"I love his character, honestly."
20-02-2018T00:53:20,TheBeckoner,Np. Im no dad but I have adopted the lifestyle.
20-02-2018T00:53:26,Dadrobit,"Spero, was the second that I know of, but there was one before that I can't recall the name of...."
20-02-2018T00:53:45,Dadrobit,And countless others that silently swung across the isle.
20-02-2018T00:53:51,unsteddyphoenix,Puppeteered everything for his waifu
20-02-2018T00:53:54,unsteddyphoenix,Thats badass
20-02-2018T00:54:23,Dadrobit,"Yeah, he grew on me the third read through."
20-02-2018T00:54:32,TheBeckoner,Maybe we get a Alaric side comic in Tom's existence?

20-02-2018T01:05:12,TheBeckoner,Work out or bend your schedule?
20-02-2018T01:05:26,unsteddyphoenix,Bend schedule
20-02-2018T01:05:38,unsteddyphoenix,Stream is in the morning here so i'll do this in the afternoon...
20-02-2018T01:05:43,NightMeaty22,Summer = wake up at 5am eat work tell 12 pm eat work tell 12 am
20-02-2018T01:05:51,TheBeckoner,It's worth it.
20-02-2018T01:05:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"That’s what I’ve found myself doing. If anything, it’s nice to just pop in and see what kind of conversation is on the day’s plate"
20-02-2018T01:05:54,unsteddyphoenix,EAT WORK
20-02-2018T01:05:59,Dadrobit,I lied.
20-02-2018T01:06:06,Dadrobit,"I went to go get a taco,"
20-02-2018T01:06:08,unsteddyphoenix,How dare you
20-02-2018T01:06:13,Dadrobit,but it did not make it to my room
20-02-2018T01:06:15,TheBeckoner,"Eating is work, yes."
20-02-2018T01:06:20,Dadrobit,So I went back for another taco
20-02-2018T01:06:27,Dadrobit,And it too did not make it to my room.
20-02-2018T01:06:29,TheBeckoner,Endless cycle
20-02-2018T01:06:33,Dadrobit,So I am tacoless
20-02-2018T01:06:42,Dadrobit,Except for the tacos in my fridge
20-02-2018T01:06:45,TheBeckoner,That is unfortunate.
20-02-2018T01:06:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll make a snack to eat while making a snack
20-02-2018T01:06:56,TheBeckoner,Consume them as well?
20-02-2018T01:06:59,SpazztasticKiwi,So you’re not alone
20-02-2018T01:07:07,TheBeckoner,I do the same Spazz.
20-02-2018T01:07:16,Dadrobit,"I want to, but they are for later"
20-02-2018T01:07:36,Dadrobit,I think I have 5 tacos remaining
20-02-2018T01:07:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Self control is key
20-02-2018T01:07:42,Dadrobit,Maybe 4

20-02-2018T01:08:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Like this morning? I meant to make some waffles and honey butter syrup. Ended up making eggs too
20-02-2018T01:08:25,NightMeaty22,...

20-02-2018T01:08:52,Dadrobit,"Yup, eggs are nutricious and delicious"
20-02-2018T01:08:58,SpazztasticKiwi,It was breakfast. I don’t normally cook a lot if it’s just me
20-02-2018T01:08:59,Dadrobit,I might go make an egg now...

20-02-2018T01:29:54,Dadrobit,Is just a breakfast burrito that has been reformatted

20-02-2018T01:30:19,Dadrobit,Tasty science
20-02-2018T01:32:23,Dadrobit,Literally the exact same taste as a fast food breakfast burrito
20-02-2018T01:32:35,Dadrobit,"Like, from QuickTrip"
20-02-2018T01:32:56,TheBeckoner,I desire that flavor now.
20-02-2018T01:33:02,TheBeckoner,&gt;upset
20-02-2018T01:33:06,TheBeckoner,&gt;hungry
20-02-2018T01:33:36,unsteddyphoenix,normally those two feelings do coincide
20-02-2018T01:33:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Hangry
20-02-2018T01:34:13,Twokinds,Do you think Basitin and Keidran should be lower or uppercase
20-02-2018T01:34:32,Dadrobit,I generally uppercase them when I'm writing something official
20-02-2018T01:35:02,Dadrobit,But there is a strong argument for them not being proper nouns
20-02-2018T01:35:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I uppercase them because they’re specific species
20-02-2018T01:35:25,TheBeckoner,^
20-02-2018T01:35:39,Dadrobit,As normally we don't uppercase things like Elephant even though a speciic Elephant may be named Shelly
20-02-2018T01:35:41,TheBeckoner,I would uppercase if not only for aesthetics.
20-02-2018T01:35:41,unsteddyphoenix,"Hmm...personally I would lowercase them, but it is a grey area thinking about it."
20-02-2018T01:35:49,Dadrobit,specific*
20-02-2018T01:36:05,TheBeckoner,Also you uppercase races no?
20-02-2018T01:36:34,TheBeckoner,idk
20-02-2018T01:36:38,unsteddyphoenix,"I've...seen both I think. You dont uppercase ""humans"" though"
20-02-2018T01:36:48,TheBeckoner,hmm
20-02-2018T01:37:08,Dadrobit,"Not really, like, a human can be Tom or Dick, or American, but he's still just a human."
20-02-2018T01:37:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"All three are humanoid, but not human - therefore they’re likely more considered races, yes, and “tiger Kieran” is a specific species"
20-02-2018T01:38:16,unsteddyphoenix,"Honestly, thinking about it maybe ""Humans"" SHOULD be capatalised."
20-02-2018T01:38:19,Dadrobit,"Like, if a tribe is known as Tiger Keidran, sure, that is uppercase, but as a general term it would be lower"
20-02-2018T01:38:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though technically it’s your series. Flip a coin if you can’t decide, but it’s up to you to decide the law Tom"
20-02-2018T01:38:37,TheBeckoner,I suppose it depends on how he is using it then?
20-02-2018T01:38:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless you want to do a poll 🤔
20-02-2018T01:38:54,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
20-02-2018T01:38:54,TheBeckoner,ooohhh
20-02-2018T01:39:00,TheBeckoner,Picarto poll?
20-02-2018T01:39:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I was thinking Twitter but I also remember now that Picarto has polls too
20-02-2018T01:39:40,Twokinds,But you uppercase natonality. So a basitin is also a Basitin.
20-02-2018T01:40:03,SpazztasticKiwi,You’re going to give us a complex
20-02-2018T01:40:04,Twokinds,"Grammatically, it should be context sensitive, but in practicality, it's just weird to see it seemingly randomly changing case all the time."
20-02-2018T01:40:23,TheBeckoner,So it does depend on how you use it.
20-02-2018T01:40:24,Dadrobit,Lazt naming conventions biting you in the ass
20-02-2018T01:40:28,Dadrobit,lasy*
20-02-2018T01:40:31,Dadrobit,Lazy**
20-02-2018T01:40:38,Dadrobit,My spelling has officially shat the bed
20-02-2018T01:40:40,TheBeckoner,bruh u good?
20-02-2018T01:40:43,TheBeckoner,lol
20-02-2018T01:40:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Do you have a preference Tom?
20-02-2018T01:41:24,Twokinds,I prefer it uppercase...
20-02-2018T01:41:51,Dadrobit,"Individual nationalities among the races would have helped, but noe you're kinda stuck with Easter Basitin weirdness"
20-02-2018T01:41:53,unsteddyphoenix,"I think you have to uppercase ""Human"" too then, personally."
20-02-2018T01:42:00,Dadrobit,now*
20-02-2018T01:42:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Uppercase it is then
20-02-2018T01:42:39,TheBeckoner,"I like capitals on ""special"" words personally...if that makes sense"
20-02-2018T01:42:54,Dadrobit,"Dunno, I think individually applying proper capitals would be time consuming, but would come off as more official."
20-02-2018T01:43:52,SpazztasticKiwi,English is weird though. It traps other languages in back ally’s and beats them up for spare spelling and grammar
20-02-2018T01:44:04,Twokinds,Hm
20-02-2018T01:44:22,Dadrobit,"Eh, proper nouns are pretty well defined tbh."
20-02-2018T01:44:46,Dadrobit,"It's just I before E ""rules"" and its ilk that trip people up"
20-02-2018T01:45:03,SpazztasticKiwi,You don’t notice how insane English is until you try to learn another language
20-02-2018T01:45:14,TheBeckoner,"""Dave is an American human"" but also ""Human race"" right?"
20-02-2018T01:45:23,unsteddyphoenix,English isnt the worst but it can be messy
20-02-2018T01:45:46,Dadrobit,Human race is an organization
20-02-2018T01:45:55,Dadrobit,but an individual human is just that
20-02-2018T01:46:02,Dadrobit,Until that human becomes Dave
20-02-2018T01:46:26,wolfspartan1,good night guys cya tom
20-02-2018T01:46:28,unsteddyphoenix,"Seems like a waste of effort to do all the pronouns ""correctly"". Such a tedious thing to remember for a situation that will almost never happen."

20-02-2018T01:46:39,TheBeckoner,Night
20-02-2018T01:46:44,wolfspartan1,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
20-02-2018T01:47:15,unsteddyphoenix,I'd rather it be consistent and technically wrong honestly. One of those things the reader shouldn't notice.
20-02-2018T01:47:22,Dadrobit,"Boy, I almost have half a desire to take that ""Seems like a waste of effort to do all the pronouns ""correctly""."" out of context in front of some He vs She Natani squabbles"
20-02-2018T01:47:26,Dadrobit,Night
20-02-2018T01:47:36,Dadrobit,You'd get some 4chan hate then :D
20-02-2018T01:47:42,TheBeckoner,do it and ur cool.
20-02-2018T01:47:52,unsteddyphoenix,Pfft. Does 4chan care? I thought reddit was the place for that
20-02-2018T01:48:27,Dadrobit,"Depends on how close to my own brand of ""cancer"" you can achieve lol"
20-02-2018T01:48:38,unsteddyphoenix,"But I mean like, I think either all upper or all lower is best, 'cause you don't want the reader noticing that type of thing."
20-02-2018T01:49:09,Dadrobit,Dunno I think having the variant more clearly defines that certain organizations /are/ more important than others.
20-02-2018T01:49:29,Dadrobit,And I think that's quite important
20-02-2018T01:50:11,unsteddyphoenix,Im not entirely sure what you mean but it sounds vaguely racist
20-02-2018T01:50:28,TheBeckoner,"I agree with dad, but you gotta start off correctly otherwise it would suck to fix."
20-02-2018T01:50:29,Dadrobit,"Because you don't want to have to have the reader trying to decode whether or not ""so-and-so"" is talking about the race as a whole, the idea, or an important organization among them"
20-02-2018T01:51:25,Dadrobit,"Like, when Natani is mentioning ""snow wolves"" Is that a tribe? A few members of the race? The race as a whole?"
20-02-2018T01:51:59,SpazztasticKiwi,You could say that specific species of wolf translate into tribes in TK
20-02-2018T01:52:39,unsteddyphoenix,...wouldnt that be capatalised no matter what?
20-02-2018T01:52:40,Dadrobit,I think my sentance made sense... I think?
20-02-2018T01:53:01,TheBeckoner,sentance make no sance
20-02-2018T01:53:11,TheBeckoner,It made sense tho
20-02-2018T01:54:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"That’s what I mean: tribes (such as Native American tribes) are capitalized, so if species of wolves are translating as tribes of wolves, they would be capitalized"
20-02-2018T01:54:41,Dadrobit,"Hmmm, I think I brain farted on my reasoning there. I meant to imply that instance of ""Snow Wolf Keidran"" would be capitalized, whereas not all keidran would fall into that category and thus not be capitalized itself."
20-02-2018T01:55:02,unsteddyphoenix,Ohh I see what you're saying.
20-02-2018T01:55:08,Dadrobit,What Kiwi said.
20-02-2018T01:55:12,SpazztasticKiwi,YES
20-02-2018T01:55:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom, we cracked the code"
20-02-2018T01:55:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I think
20-02-2018T01:55:42,TheBeckoner,"makes sense, makes sense."
20-02-2018T01:55:47,Twokinds,But like...
20-02-2018T01:56:03,Dadrobit,"But it becomes awkward in Twokinds because they don't have monikers like ""Hohokum"", Mekkans are like, ""Tiger Keidran"""
20-02-2018T01:56:13,Dadrobit,Which makes it weird
20-02-2018T01:56:28,Dadrobit,Or Eastern Basitin
20-02-2018T01:56:32,unsteddyphoenix,Im still not convinced that means we need to do that though
20-02-2018T01:57:03,Twokinds,"When characters say ""The Keidran"" ""That Keidran""... is it not like saying ""The Brit"" ""That Swede"""
20-02-2018T01:57:18,Dadrobit,"Yeah, so they'd be not capitalized"
20-02-2018T01:57:19,SpazztasticKiwi,It would seem so
20-02-2018T01:58:12,TheBeckoner,"so like ""That guy"" same thing?"
20-02-2018T01:59:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"“Brit” and “Swede” are abbreviations for nationalities though, so they have to be capitalized"
20-02-2018T01:59:33,unsteddyphoenix,"So are basitin and keidran, probably"
20-02-2018T01:59:49,unsteddyphoenix,"Or, basitin at least"
20-02-2018T01:59:55,Twokinds,But... Brit and Yank are capitalized.
20-02-2018T02:00:03,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it'd have to be a sentance akin to ""That Tiger Keidran"" which would allude to their inclusion among a particular Tribe"
20-02-2018T02:00:10,Dadrobit,"They're names, proper noun"
20-02-2018T02:00:56,Dadrobit,"Proper nouns = individual person, place, or organization"
20-02-2018T02:00:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Yank isn’t always capitalized down in the south. It’s (I think) a football team or something and an insult to mean something like “inbreed”
20-02-2018T02:01:25,unsteddyphoenix,I thought yankee was just slang for american...
20-02-2018T02:01:32,TheBeckoner,"so if it were ""brits"" or ""swedes"" it would be like that - lowercase?"
20-02-2018T02:01:41,SpazztasticKiwi,The team is capitalized but the insult is not
20-02-2018T02:01:44,Twokinds,Eugh
20-02-2018T02:01:49,Twokinds,"I dunno, I don't care enough"
20-02-2018T02:01:52,Dadrobit,Common noun = class of objects or a concept
20-02-2018T02:02:02,Dadrobit,"class of objects being ""keidran"""
20-02-2018T02:02:38,unsteddyphoenix,"In any case, I still kind of feel like capatilising all of it is the way, it's such a specific scenario that makes it even somewhat questionable."
20-02-2018T02:03:04,TheBeckoner,dowahtfeelsgoodmaybe?
20-02-2018T02:03:10,TheBeckoner,I dunno
20-02-2018T02:03:10,Twokinds,"Any time it's wrong, the character is just referring to their race/nationality, whichever is right."

20-02-2018T02:03:56,TheBeckoner,would the last basitin be lowercase?
20-02-2018T02:04:01,Dadrobit,"So like your hands method? ""Draw them wrong and hope nobody notices""? Lol"
20-02-2018T02:04:55,Dadrobit,"""The basitin from The Western Basitin Isles is a basitin"""
20-02-2018T02:05:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Nothing like a grammar debate at one in the morning

20-02-2018T02:06:20,unsteddyphoenix,argh my head lol
20-02-2018T02:06:28,Twokinds,"What about a keidran who's nationality is Basitin? They are a Basitin, but not a basitin."
20-02-2018T02:06:46,SpazztasticKiwi,You need to stop
20-02-2018T02:07:02,TheBeckoner,lol
20-02-2018T02:07:21,unsteddyphoenix,The Keidran Basitin lived with the Basitins.
20-02-2018T02:07:26,Bgrmystr2,A Basidran?
20-02-2018T02:07:26,unsteddyphoenix,Fight me.
20-02-2018T02:07:36,Dadrobit,"I think it is. Because basitin there at first is the plural of the objects known as ""basitin"" and the third is an individual concept of a ""basitin"". Both common nouns"
20-02-2018T02:07:54,Dadrobit,Correct Tom
20-02-2018T02:08:07,TheBeckoner,"""The Keidran Basitin lived with the basitins."" ?"
20-02-2018T02:08:08,unsteddyphoenix,Did you just call basitins objects how dare you
20-02-2018T02:08:10,unsteddyphoenix,classic human
20-02-2018T02:08:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"Youre talking about someone who is a Keidran but identifies as a Bastion nationally because that’s where they were born, right?"
20-02-2018T02:08:19,Twokinds,You know what? This is why a lot of comics are in all caps.
20-02-2018T02:08:23,Bgrmystr2,"Also, I apparently missed a bunch of English stuff."
20-02-2018T02:08:24,Dadrobit,"See, even you lowercased ""human"" :D"
20-02-2018T02:08:35,unsteddyphoenix,Lol I did notice that
20-02-2018T02:09:07,Twokinds,THE BASITIN FROM THE BASTIN ISLAND IS A BASITIN.
20-02-2018T02:09:12,Twokinds,THERE I FIXED IT
20-02-2018T02:09:14,TheBeckoner,"If it makes you feel any better, I didn't even care till  this discussion lol Now I will notice forever."
20-02-2018T02:09:14,Dadrobit,"Pops taught a year of AP English a long ass time ago, But I don't feel like calling him up at midnight for this..."
20-02-2018T02:09:23,unsteddyphoenix,Now we're getting somewhere...
20-02-2018T02:09:30,unsteddyphoenix,You actually should later.
20-02-2018T02:09:36,Dadrobit,THE bASITIN FROM THE BASITIN ISLAND IS A bASITIN
20-02-2018T02:09:43,TheBeckoner,BETTER
20-02-2018T02:09:47,unsteddyphoenix,This is an interesting and fairly pointless conversation
20-02-2018T02:09:50,TheBeckoner,YELLING IS GOOD.
20-02-2018T02:09:53,Twokinds,"I get what's right, I just don't wanna do the work :P"
20-02-2018T02:09:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Great. Now everyone in the comic will be screaming
20-02-2018T02:10:07,TheBeckoner,That would be fun.
20-02-2018T02:10:09,Bgrmystr2,"Best comic, Kiwi"
20-02-2018T02:10:10,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah you'd have to remember it for like...2 instances where it'd be relevant.
20-02-2018T02:10:18,unsteddyphoenix,Dont think it's worth it.
20-02-2018T02:10:26,Twokinds,"Anyway, Book 4 is pretty much done now"
20-02-2018T02:10:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"It’s been just fine so far. With this, you’ve thrown a wrench in the machine"
20-02-2018T02:10:43,Dadrobit,I think lowercase all of it. You'll remember to uppercase the proper ones because they're importqant to you and will thus be important to the reader.
20-02-2018T02:10:50,Dadrobit,important*
20-02-2018T02:10:51,Twokinds,I'm adding some eye candy now
20-02-2018T02:10:55,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh yeah, what did the ""first printed in Jan"" mean in the end?"
20-02-2018T02:10:59,TheBeckoner,Make the text really small.
20-02-2018T02:11:01,Twokinds,Just a little extra
20-02-2018T02:11:02,unsteddyphoenix,Was kinda curious

20-02-2018T02:11:22,Twokinds,It'll be whatever date it first prints
20-02-2018T02:11:23,unsteddyphoenix,Ahhh ok
20-02-2018T02:11:30,unsteddyphoenix,Makes sense
20-02-2018T02:11:52,unsteddyphoenix,Got a date for that?
20-02-2018T02:12:03,Dadrobit,Don't wanna steal from my retirement fund for this lol
20-02-2018T02:12:16,Twokinds,Nope
20-02-2018T02:12:19,Twokinds,But before JUly
20-02-2018T02:12:32,unsteddyphoenix,Ah nice.

20-02-2018T02:13:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I like shiny
20-02-2018T02:13:47,Dadrobit,My luck and my print will end up as a Monday funny black and white dot matrix print
20-02-2018T02:14:26,Dadrobit,"Actually, that'd be pretty swag"

20-02-2018T02:27:02,unsteddyphoenix,Really?
20-02-2018T02:27:30,unsteddyphoenix,Is Twokinds like those games where children are invincible? :thinking:
20-02-2018T02:28:25,Dadrobit,Tom had taken out the mention that they were children and removed the blood from the architect's robes
20-02-2018T02:28:26,Twokinds,Nope kids are extra points
20-02-2018T02:28:45,unsteddyphoenix,Yeeeessss~:ctwokinds-clovischuckle:
20-02-2018T02:28:54,Dadrobit,If the forums will load...
20-02-2018T02:29:03,SpazztasticKiwi,👌🏻
20-02-2018T02:29:52,unsteddyphoenix,Why remove robe-blood but leave an open ribcage on the floor?
20-02-2018T02:30:37,Dadrobit,It was also around the time that his killcount was drastically reduced.
20-02-2018T02:30:47,Dadrobit,"And that was the spy, not Trace"
20-02-2018T02:31:26,unsteddyphoenix,I know?
20-02-2018T02:31:28,Dadrobit,https://www.twokinds.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=896761#p896761
20-02-2018T02:32:02,unsteddyphoenix,why does this read like patch notes lol
20-02-2018T02:32:26,Dadrobit,"""Randal no longer refers to his students as children, possibly to make Trace a slightly less awful human being."""
20-02-2018T02:32:43,unsteddyphoenix,MAren was once a templar? Wha?
20-02-2018T02:32:48,Dadrobit,But children was added again and the blood returned
20-02-2018T02:32:58,unsteddyphoenix,That would be interestin if still canon
20-02-2018T02:33:31,Dadrobit,"Huh, a year ago almost to the day"
20-02-2018T02:34:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"The term “children” can be user-dependent, though. 18 is technically an adult but older people still refer to them as children in many cases"
20-02-2018T02:34:32,unsteddyphoenix,good point
20-02-2018T02:34:39,unsteddyphoenix,"Should make it ""babies"""
20-02-2018T02:34:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Children can also be used to mean immature
20-02-2018T02:35:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe that’s what the guy meant
20-02-2018T02:35:55,Dadrobit,"Naw, pretty sure they're just younglings"
20-02-2018T02:36:01,unsteddyphoenix,"""Alaric's tail wag was removed. Tom is a monster"" unacceptable."
20-02-2018T02:36:16,Twokinds,It wasn't
20-02-2018T02:36:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t see a need to look at someone’s cherry picking at a story I like
20-02-2018T02:37:25,unsteddyphoenix,For fun?
20-02-2018T02:37:31,unsteddyphoenix,Also thank god
20-02-2018T02:40:57,Dadrobit,Where is the tail wag?
20-02-2018T02:45:18,Dadrobit,"the ""wag"" tag in the search engine isn't turning anything up with Alaric."
20-02-2018T02:45:41,Twokinds,"It wasn't removed, it was lost and no one told me."
20-02-2018T02:46:03,Dadrobit,Ahhhhhh!
20-02-2018T02:46:15,Dadrobit,Do you recall where you last left it?
20-02-2018T02:46:24,Bgrmystr2,how'd you lose it? xD
20-02-2018T02:47:01,Twokinds,"Most changes like that aren't because I'm maliciously changing things. It's because the process was automated, and the photoshop file long ago wasn't saved after a change was made between the jpg and psd."
20-02-2018T02:47:43,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
20-02-2018T02:48:01,SpazztasticKiwi,So your computer ate it?
20-02-2018T02:48:24,Twokinds,So something like tail wagging or blood added last minute that wasn't saved and caused a discrepensy and people don't tell me it's different so I never fix it.
20-02-2018T02:48:57,Dadrobit,"Yes, Kiwi, it would seem it took a ""megabyte"" out of the comic."
20-02-2018T02:49:22,Dadrobit,"Damn... Well, now you know?"
20-02-2018T02:49:37,Twokinds,"I see the issue. The original jpg has a tail wagging, but the original psd doesn't have a tail there"
20-02-2018T02:50:26,Twokinds,I must have put it in last minute and put it in right before saving it as a jpg but forgot to save the updated psd.
20-02-2018T02:50:49,Bgrmystr2,rip :/
20-02-2018T02:50:54,Dadrobit,Which page was this?
20-02-2018T02:51:11,Twokinds,Alaric's statue
20-02-2018T02:51:59,Dadrobit,"Yup, can confirm, not in the book either D:"
20-02-2018T02:52:03,unsteddyphoenix,What a loss...:(
20-02-2018T02:52:23,Dadrobit,It really is
20-02-2018T02:52:46,Bgrmystr2,I dunno what page number that is
20-02-2018T02:52:48,Bgrmystr2,D:
20-02-2018T02:53:12,Twokinds,Oh well
20-02-2018T02:53:30,Twokinds,"I can add it back in online, but it'll require redrawing the tail"
20-02-2018T02:54:01,unsteddyphoenix,"If you make any one change, make it that one."
20-02-2018T02:54:37,Dadrobit,"Honest question, can you update your physical printer with this alteration for future prints? Assuming that would probably come with a fee."
20-02-2018T02:56:22,Twokinds,Uh...
20-02-2018T02:56:36,Twokinds,Yeah but books are ordered in bulk.
20-02-2018T02:56:50,Twokinds,It'd have to be on another printing run.
20-02-2018T02:58:26,Dadrobit,"Ah, do they update you when a printing run is getting low then? I honestly don't intimately know how book distrobution works."
20-02-2018T02:58:42,Dadrobit,"Like, I knew they did runs, but not how much at once"
20-02-2018T02:59:01,Twokinds,Yeah.
20-02-2018T03:07:42,SpazztasticKiwi,What conventions are you found at other than Comicon?
20-02-2018T03:21:02,Twokinds,Uh...
20-02-2018T03:21:07,Twokinds,None.
20-02-2018T03:24:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok
20-02-2018T03:24:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Just curious
20-02-2018T03:25:02,Twokinds,"I considered going to anthrocon this year, actually! It would have been my first fur convention. But I didn't make it in, apparently."
20-02-2018T03:25:33,Twokinds,"For the best, I guess."
20-02-2018T03:26:08,Bgrmystr2,were the tickets sold out or something?
20-02-2018T03:27:54,Twokinds,"Tables all sold out, yes."
20-02-2018T03:28:09,Bgrmystr2,ahh
20-02-2018T03:28:16,Bgrmystr2,didn't want to go as a guest? :O
20-02-2018T03:28:27,Dadrobit,"Mmmmm, lotsa stress setting up a booth for a con. My sister set up her booth again and even though it's her third or fourth time she still pulls her hair out."
20-02-2018T03:28:55,Dadrobit,Not to mention always getting con-crud
20-02-2018T03:29:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I was talking about as a vendor and as a visitor
20-02-2018T03:29:24,Dadrobit,Nothing like stressing yourself so you can get sick for half a month
20-02-2018T03:31:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Like you’d set up at Comicon but go as a regular visitor to whatever else because it’s a video game con and you like video games
20-02-2018T03:38:18,unsteddyphoenix,For the best how exactly?
20-02-2018T03:39:52,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-RainezZz::ctwokinds-RainezZz::ctwokinds-RainezZz:
20-02-2018T03:43:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Not entirely sure that means you’re going to bed or...
20-02-2018T03:45:19,unsteddyphoenix,What do people even do there?
20-02-2018T03:49:48,SpazztasticKiwi,🤷🏻‍♀️
20-02-2018T03:51:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I think a friend of mine went to one or something similar. From what I gather people go dressed up as whatever and hang out
20-02-2018T03:53:14,SpazztasticKiwi,It collects funds for charities and displays animation and artists/their work
20-02-2018T03:53:35,unsteddyphoenix,Hm. I guess you go for the art mainly
20-02-2018T03:56:16,unsteddyphoenix,I heard there are parties but that's not really at the con I guess
20-02-2018T03:57:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Awhile ago there were warnings of a man going to these kinds of conventions and assaulting women
20-02-2018T04:00:24,unsteddyphoenix,Sad. Doesn't happen regularly I assume tho
20-02-2018T04:03:09,SpazztasticKiwi,He got caught after bragging about it on FB
20-02-2018T04:03:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"One of many many reasons I don’t go anywhere without a group, preferably with a guy in it"
20-02-2018T04:04:16,unsteddyphoenix,"Haha, I love when people get caught like that. So dumb"
20-02-2018T04:04:54,unsteddyphoenix,"Suppose that's wise, at night at least"
20-02-2018T04:05:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh I don’t go out at night. Another precaution
20-02-2018T04:08:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"Met a really terrifying looking guy at my old job. One night someone had to pick me up because I didn’t have my car, but they were a few blocks away"
20-02-2018T04:10:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"When we close at this job, we’re required to leave the premises. But my pick up wasn’t ready to come get me"
20-02-2018T04:10:32,SpazztasticKiwi,This terrifying guy? Fellow fan - he drove me to my pick up so I didn’t have to walk
20-02-2018T04:26:23,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s almost 4 I’ve got to go to bed
20-02-2018T04:26:34,unsteddyphoenix,jeez
20-02-2018T04:26:45,unsteddyphoenix,ANOTHER fellow fan

20-02-2018T14:02:12,TheBeckoner,Hey Tom did you add the glow and stuff to Eva Suit Flora before you posted it? Or was it there in the stream?
20-02-2018T14:06:09,MidnightBlue78,"Hola Tomás, cómo estás hoy?"
20-02-2018T14:08:19,MidnightBlue78,:ptv-uneasy:

20-02-2018T14:10:15,Bgrmystr2,it was his pre-stream prep sketch
20-02-2018T14:10:35,TheBeckoner,"Well he previewed it for a second iirc, it just seemed like something was added."
20-02-2018T14:10:42,TheBeckoner,I guess it was the blue
20-02-2018T14:10:52,Bgrmystr2,Yeah it was just the blue
20-02-2018T14:11:00,Bgrmystr2,I've got images from in the stream

20-02-2018T20:21:22,PalmettoPathfinder1,Hi y'all!  Well I found out how much my root canal and crown are going to cost.  In the $900 range after insurance pays the rest.  Boy I'm wishing I had the same amount of supporters as Tom now.
20-02-2018T20:21:56,Bgrmystr2,"Palm, consider yourself lucky you even have insurance for that"
20-02-2018T20:22:04,Bgrmystr2,I didn't.
20-02-2018T20:22:14,Bgrmystr2,"Multiple root canals, multiple crowns"
20-02-2018T20:22:16,Bgrmystr2,and multiple removals
20-02-2018T20:22:21,Bgrmystr2,all completely out of pocket.
20-02-2018T20:22:42,PalmettoPathfinder1,Well I don't make that much.  I barely make $300 every other week.
20-02-2018T20:22:55,PalmettoPathfinder1,And I'm full time too
20-02-2018T20:23:26,Bgrmystr2,"Congrats, I'm lucky to make $80-120 every couple of months, and that goes to help pay bills. I don't even get money for myself at all"
20-02-2018T20:23:38,Bgrmystr2,you're way better off than I am xD
20-02-2018T20:23:56,PalmettoPathfinder1,Most of my money goes to bills too.
20-02-2018T20:26:29,Bgrmystr2,just seems like you're complaining a lot for someone that's not actually in a bad spot at all
20-02-2018T20:29:30,PalmettoPathfinder1,I did upload some stuff to my Patreon.  Um....I am in a bad spot.  I don't make a lot of money.  Because I try to get pics for my books and commissions aren't cheap.
20-02-2018T20:30:03,Bgrmystr2,"If you have enough money for commissions, you're not that bad off, bro."
20-02-2018T20:30:14,Bgrmystr2,"If you were, you wouldn't be paying for those commissions in the first place"
20-02-2018T20:30:46,PalmettoPathfinder1,I have to decide whether to eat or get commissions
20-02-2018T20:31:19,Bgrmystr2,xD that's what you decide between?
20-02-2018T20:32:21,PalmettoPathfinder1,Yeah pretty much.  And even then I don't decide to do even those as I have to help my parents pay their home equity loan
20-02-2018T20:33:02,PalmettoPathfinder1,They took out a home equity loan to help me get my house.
20-02-2018T20:33:21,PalmettoPathfinder1,So I have to pay them back.
20-02-2018T20:33:24,Bgrmystr2,"you are not great at managing money, are you?"
20-02-2018T20:34:24,PalmettoPathfinder1,I try.  It's easier said than done though.  I usually do good managing my money but I got slapped recently with a lot of bills.
20-02-2018T20:35:21,Bgrmystr2,"If, mentally, you're debating on food vs commissions, I think you have more problems with your money management than you do with actual money"
20-02-2018T20:35:43,PalmettoPathfinder1,Mostly medical and dental bills.
20-02-2018T20:36:46,Bgrmystr2,"I don't have a single dollar going out to anyone on patreon, not a single commission bought ever. It all goes to a $8k+ dental bill"
20-02-2018T20:37:02,Bgrmystr2,because no insurance will cover me.
20-02-2018T20:37:11,PalmettoPathfinder1,And the IRS says that I'm below the poverty line.    Why won't they cover you?
20-02-2018T20:37:28,Bgrmystr2,"they refused, then wouldn't give any info afterwards"
20-02-2018T20:37:35,Bgrmystr2,so you think you're in a tough spot? lolno
20-02-2018T20:41:43,PalmettoPathfinder1,Well for both our sakes I hope things improve.  I'll keep you in my prayers and you keep me in your prayers.  Besides I'm trying to commission .
20-02-2018T20:41:54,PalmettoPathfinder1,UlarioGryphon
20-02-2018T20:42:13,PalmettoPathfinder1,And if you like I could always commission a picture for you.

20-02-2018T21:16:04,TheBeckoner,I dont really care tbh
20-02-2018T21:16:12,Bgrmystr2,It's already a commonwealth
20-02-2018T21:16:16,Bgrmystr2,they already have US Citizenship
20-02-2018T21:16:19,Edinku,"Im not from the US, so... dunno"
20-02-2018T21:16:22,MidnightBlue78,But im sure a lot of people will hate the idea
20-02-2018T21:16:27,Bgrmystr2,they don't gain all the benefits of being a US Citizen though
20-02-2018T21:16:31,TheFDdriver,true
20-02-2018T21:16:45,Bgrmystr2,"so for PR, it would be more beneficial for them to become a state"
20-02-2018T21:16:56,Bgrmystr2,and they would gain the full benefits of being a state
20-02-2018T21:17:04,PalmettoPathfinder1,Y'all are really apathetic about current events and history in the making!
20-02-2018T21:17:06,Bgrmystr2,and I doubt it would hurt the rest of the US at all
20-02-2018T21:17:07,DevlNuK,I'm too dumb and retard  to understand these things.
20-02-2018T21:17:09,TheFDdriver,that means the debt is gone
20-02-2018T21:17:46,PalmettoPathfinder1,I remember when the Berlin Wall came down.

20-02-2018T23:34:41,Whitestripes,They need to put it netflix already

20-02-2018T23:35:50,146Time,they could have stuck with that plot for at least 2-3 seasons

20-02-2018T23:36:25,NovaPumnox,I kinda hate where teen titans is right now with the extremely cartoony look along with attempts for mostly humor to be around.

20-02-2018T23:38:58,TheBeckoner,I mean even humans in old age stop caring. I would assume a dragon in there early 100's would too.

20-02-2018T23:46:03,MuonNeutrino,"@146Time the best we have is the aging chart tom did on the patreon, where 1-5 is childhood, 6 is just pre-teen, 7 is teen, 8 is adult, and old age sets in at about 20ish"
20-02-2018T23:46:08,Mustanglvr007,No kidding*
20-02-2018T23:46:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Awwww sleepy time Zenny

20-02-2018T23:47:44,BadFoMo,"Flora: You're 20?! Reni: Rotten little skamp, arn't I?"
20-02-2018T23:47:45,146Time,"to be fair, she didn't die of old age"
20-02-2018T23:47:54,Ordithus,"Yeah, but it makes it all the more tragic"
20-02-2018T23:48:03,Mustanglvr007,She was murdered

20-02-2018T23:49:53,MuonNeutrino,"i mean, i got a 'young' vibe from her for sure, but i figured 'young **for a dragon*' would be more than 20 &gt;.&gt;"
20-02-2018T23:49:59,unsteddyphoenix,If she was that old she'd know some magic
20-02-2018T23:50:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Boy, kids grow up fast these days"
