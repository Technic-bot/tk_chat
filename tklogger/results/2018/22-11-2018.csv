22-11-2018T00:12:52,unsteddyphoenix,Mixed with vodka for the drinkers?
22-11-2018T00:13:00,RimaDraws,no
22-11-2018T00:13:18,RimaDraws,also my cat tried to drink my iced tea earlier from my glass
22-11-2018T00:13:32,unsteddyphoenix,Aw
22-11-2018T00:13:36,unsteddyphoenix,"Also, d'aw"
22-11-2018T00:14:01,RimaDraws,he is a stinker
22-11-2018T00:14:50,Dadrobit,Cranberry juice with vodka. Dear god why.
22-11-2018T00:15:08,RimaDraws,idk
22-11-2018T00:15:10,RimaDraws,but it sounds gross
22-11-2018T00:16:16,unsteddyphoenix,I invented a drink the other day
22-11-2018T00:16:21,unsteddyphoenix,Rum + apple juice
22-11-2018T00:16:35,RimaDraws,after i get this patreon art done i need to think of new ideas for art next month
22-11-2018T00:17:02,unsteddyphoenix,"I call it the ""barbossa"""
22-11-2018T00:17:13,unsteddyphoenix,You dont do the patreon requests thing?
22-11-2018T00:17:20,RimaDraws,say what
22-11-2018T00:17:37,RimaDraws,i only have 4 patrons
22-11-2018T00:18:20,unsteddyphoenix,"Still, they could help with ideas"
22-11-2018T00:18:34,RimaDraws,i barely have communication on my patreon
22-11-2018T00:18:49,RimaDraws,honestly im wondering if i should just keep it for four of them
22-11-2018T00:18:53,unsteddyphoenix,"Hm, I see. Fair enough."
22-11-2018T00:19:26,RimaDraws,i mean four is kinda....amateur
22-11-2018T00:19:47,RimaDraws,and they're friends i mean its embarrassing your friends have to support you
22-11-2018T00:20:06,Dadrobit,Do that with sparkling cider and you have yourself a Rum Sparkler.
22-11-2018T00:20:11,unsteddyphoenix,I wouldnt say that. Everyone starts somewhere
22-11-2018T00:20:18,unsteddyphoenix,"Oooo, good idea~"
22-11-2018T00:20:26,RimaDraws,yea ive been trying to get more supporters but its hard to do that
22-11-2018T00:20:45,RimaDraws,i need something to focus on for patreon and get it set up
22-11-2018T00:21:29,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I feel ya. Some of the first gigs I got were for my father and the local college."
22-11-2018T00:21:51,RimaDraws,i mean im trying to expand. but i dont know how
22-11-2018T00:23:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I got me
22-11-2018T00:23:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Some Sanders pins
22-11-2018T00:23:36,RimaDraws,i mean i share my stuff on social media but thats it
22-11-2018T00:23:48,SpazztasticKiwi,50% off. Imma happy camper
22-11-2018T00:24:20,Dadrobit,:/ I wish I knew how to help.
22-11-2018T00:24:21,unsteddyphoenix,bernie sanders?
22-11-2018T00:25:27,Dadrobit,I got a lot of my start-up success (I wish lol) from dedicated vox platforms and dedicated vox subreddits.
22-11-2018T00:26:07,Dadrobit,But illustration is so much more widespread and yet heavily populated.
22-11-2018T00:26:56,RimaDraws,yea i need to find a way to expand my audience
22-11-2018T00:27:01,Dadrobit,"Either you'd be a tiny fish in a ginormous subreddit, or a big fish in a tiny subreddit that gets you no visibility."
22-11-2018T00:28:30,RimaDraws,i mean i want to be one of the big fishes one day...
22-11-2018T00:28:32,Dadrobit,"I mean, as much as I personally don't like the service, you could always offer to do work for $50 a pop illustrations on Fiverr? Just to get somewhere?"
22-11-2018T00:28:42,RimaDraws,ive tried that
22-11-2018T00:28:47,RimaDraws,it doesnt work for me
22-11-2018T00:28:50,Dadrobit,:/
22-11-2018T00:28:57,unsteddyphoenix,Wait
22-11-2018T00:29:02,unsteddyphoenix,fiverr does $50 stuff?
22-11-2018T00:29:08,unsteddyphoenix,Doesnt that...defeat the purpose?
22-11-2018T00:29:14,Dadrobit,Fiverr lets you set the price to whatever you want.
22-11-2018T00:29:36,unsteddyphoenix,huh. I thought the whole point was you could get any weird thing for $5\
22-11-2018T00:29:37,Dadrobit,"Folks do legit work over there, swamped in all the $5 bullshit."
22-11-2018T00:30:22,RimaDraws,i dont know what else to do then
22-11-2018T00:31:22,unsteddyphoenix,"The longer you try, the greater the chance you take off"
22-11-2018T00:31:26,unsteddyphoenix,Probably
22-11-2018T00:31:42,RimaDraws,i mean does anyone else have ideas??
22-11-2018T00:31:44,RimaDraws,im all ears
22-11-2018T00:31:54,Mippy,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
22-11-2018T00:32:06,unsteddyphoenix,For how to get popular and famous? If I did then...
22-11-2018T00:32:19,RimaDraws,no i mean expand my audience
22-11-2018T00:32:55,unsteddyphoenix,You could...advertise cheap commissions in furry circles for a while?
22-11-2018T00:32:57,Dadrobit,"I mean, you could always apply for a gig at a dedicated illustration office?"
22-11-2018T00:33:14,unsteddyphoenix,"A ""sale"" so to speak"
22-11-2018T00:33:31,RimaDraws,ive been trying more commissions and i put up a journal for $10 off original prices till after christmas
22-11-2018T00:33:32,RimaDraws,nothing
22-11-2018T00:33:37,Dadrobit,"Also, yes. Furries are ludicrously loose with their money."
22-11-2018T00:33:47,RimaDraws,im still trying to finish backlog
22-11-2018T00:33:54,RimaDraws,and i dont want to dishonor it
22-11-2018T00:34:00,Twokinds,lol
22-11-2018T00:34:09,RimaDraws,im just out of ideas
22-11-2018T00:34:21,Dadrobit,Nose. Meet grindstone.
22-11-2018T00:34:33,Twokinds,Gotta make something people want to see.
22-11-2018T00:34:45,RimaDraws,i dont know how to do that...
22-11-2018T00:34:53,Mippy,More of this :ctwokinds-florajiggle:
22-11-2018T00:34:57,RimaDraws,ive been on edge all week since monday
22-11-2018T00:37:33,unsteddyphoenix,Gotta draw boobs on dragons
22-11-2018T00:37:35,unsteddyphoenix,Appease the masses
22-11-2018T00:37:42,RimaDraws,i can't draw dragons
22-11-2018T00:37:47,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah they look really hard
22-11-2018T00:37:50,RimaDraws,my art isn't that advanced...
22-11-2018T00:37:56,RimaDraws,it kinda sucks
22-11-2018T00:39:01,unsteddyphoenix,No bullying your art.
22-11-2018T00:39:14,unsteddyphoenix,Hell i'd like to be at your level
22-11-2018T00:39:34,RimaDraws,okay im not advanced and i am still learning the ropes on digital especially drawing for 22 years of my life and only 6 spent on digital
22-11-2018T00:39:58,Dadrobit,"Dragons are easy. ""To begin, draw an S. For: Snake.... Or... Dragon. Whatever. Now draw a more different S..."""
22-11-2018T00:40:34,unsteddyphoenix,Humans: Just keep drawing circles until youre done
22-11-2018T00:40:52,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s plenty of art styles. It doesn’t have to look realistic - my shite sure doesn’t
22-11-2018T00:41:28,RimaDraws,like i said monday didn't help my nerves at all and if my art program crashing wasn't bad enough
22-11-2018T00:41:28,SpazztasticKiwi,And the issue is improvement can’t happen without effort
22-11-2018T00:41:51,RimaDraws,believe me im trying to improve my art everyday. there are just things im scared to try
22-11-2018T00:41:55,unsteddyphoenix,I hate that effort thing
22-11-2018T00:42:20,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I feel you. Only had three auditions actually get me gigs in the last month besides my few regulars. Money is tight."
22-11-2018T00:42:40,RimaDraws,yea if my $200 wasn't stolen at work i wouldn't be so damn uptight right now
22-11-2018T00:43:35,Dadrobit,Lemme check something real quick.
22-11-2018T00:43:49,RimaDraws,hm
22-11-2018T00:43:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"My dragon didn’t look realistic. In fact, it’s got a bit too many lines in its design for me"
22-11-2018T00:44:11,RimaDraws,dragons are hard to draw for me. maybe i need to just try studies
22-11-2018T00:44:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I also draw strictly on paper too so there’s that
22-11-2018T00:44:44,RimaDraws,oh i quit drawing on paper alot
22-11-2018T00:45:44,RimaDraws,my kitty is sleeping near me now
22-11-2018T00:46:06,SpazztasticKiwi,The way I see something before I draw is shapes. And then I draw the shapes in a broken line way
22-11-2018T00:47:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"The lines in my work are almost all free floating but as the design moves closer to the center of the paper, the lines are connected by insinuation"
22-11-2018T00:47:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m probably causing more confusion than explaination
22-11-2018T00:48:22,Dadrobit,I've done 108 auditions in the last 30 days. 69 (giggity) were listened to. 5 were accepted. Not the greatest turnover rate lol.
22-11-2018T00:49:11,RimaDraws,ugh thats bad
22-11-2018T00:49:44,Dadrobit,"Only two ended up giving me ""feedback"" which amounts to ""Thanks for your audition, but we've decided to go with another voice."""
22-11-2018T00:50:06,SpazztasticKiwi,“Thanks but pass”?
22-11-2018T00:50:16,Dadrobit,Pretty much.
22-11-2018T00:50:37,SpazztasticKiwi,:ctwokinds-katwet:bruh
22-11-2018T00:50:39,Dadrobit,I try to get one a one in ten ratio of listening to acceptance.
22-11-2018T00:50:42,RimaDraws,and thats where depression sets in for me
22-11-2018T00:51:14,Dadrobit,7% listen to accept ratio is a wee bit on the low side.
22-11-2018T00:51:26,RimaDraws,damn sure sounds it
22-11-2018T00:52:22,Dadrobit,It looks better than the 5 in 108 stat though lol.
22-11-2018T00:52:58,RimaDraws,see if someone told me thanks for the try but we decided to choose someone else that would set me into non motivation mode
22-11-2018T00:53:22,Dadrobit,"I refuse to count the ones that don't even give my audition a listen. It happens too much, and there's not much of anything I can do."
22-11-2018T00:53:30,unsteddyphoenix,It is hard when you get that
22-11-2018T00:53:43,unsteddyphoenix,But you have to force yourself. Which im...not good at admittedly
22-11-2018T00:53:49,Dadrobit,Eh. That's not too bad. Some clients can be straight up toxic.
22-11-2018T00:54:24,Dadrobit,My favorite story is from one lady who wrote a 5 page dissertation on how terrible I was for my audition.
22-11-2018T00:54:41,unsteddyphoenix,w-what?
22-11-2018T00:55:12,Dadrobit,"I stopped reading after she mentioned how it was ""painfully obvious that I was a French Canadian and that (I) needed to stop trying to sound like an American."""
22-11-2018T00:55:13,unsteddyphoenix,"Even if someone did something terrible to me, im not sure i'd exert the effort on 5 pages of text"
22-11-2018T00:55:28,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao
22-11-2018T00:55:44,unsteddyphoenix,"Ah the classic ""no idea what im talkin about"""
22-11-2018T00:55:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Next on “Why my grandchildren don’t visit”...
22-11-2018T00:56:15,Dadrobit,"It was kinda early on in my career, and I tell you what, the first two pages before I got to that were fucking soul crushing."
22-11-2018T00:56:50,Dadrobit,"But after I read it, I was like, oh, okay. Fuck this lady, she has no bearing on the word ""Quality""."
22-11-2018T00:57:01,Bgrmystr2,"the fact that they wrote 5 pages of bullshit says more about THEM than it says about you, dadro."
22-11-2018T00:57:24,Dadrobit,"Yeah, for a 25-ish second audition."
22-11-2018T00:57:36,unsteddyphoenix,"Far, far more"
22-11-2018T00:58:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"You’re speech reminds me of the horns of a steer: a point here and there, but a whole lot of bull in between"
22-11-2018T00:58:48,SpazztasticKiwi,your
22-11-2018T00:59:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Have a bless-ed day madam
22-11-2018T00:59:30,RimaDraws,lol
22-11-2018T00:59:31,RimaDraws,wow
22-11-2018T00:59:52,Dadrobit,"Not even. I just deleted her messages, blocked her account, and laughed it off."
22-11-2018T01:02:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera has walked up my hip to say hi
22-11-2018T01:02:21,Dadrobit,Hi
22-11-2018T01:02:32,RimaDraws,so i guess all i can do is keep trying to expand my audience
22-11-2018T01:02:48,RimaDraws,my fb page has shot up in likes since i revamped it
22-11-2018T01:03:08,SpazztasticKiwi,He mew
22-11-2018T01:04:32,RimaDraws,my cat wanted me to throw his ball to go chase
22-11-2018T01:06:31,SpazztasticKiwi,“I don’t care what time it is. I play”
22-11-2018T01:06:36,RimaDraws,exactly
22-11-2018T01:06:44,RimaDraws,cat desires attention you give it lol
22-11-2018T01:07:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Well Bagheera seems to be focused on making my leg go to sleep
22-11-2018T01:08:55,RimaDraws,awwww
22-11-2018T01:10:40,RimaDraws,maybe i should try free posts for non patrons
22-11-2018T01:16:51,Bgrmystr2,"lol, many of your cats would be very, VERY disappointed in me."

22-11-2018T14:40:01,Twokinds,Although I have to admit I thought that said orchard at first and wondered how big that cat must be.

22-11-2018T16:19:58,CrimsonQuill,No. They're what I had with dinner.
22-11-2018T16:20:14,CrimsonQuill,That's why I put them up.
22-11-2018T16:21:49,Mippy,Then how about a bit of explanation? Otherwise I’m gonna think you’re some kid yelling “random” words in chat because you think that’s what humor is
22-11-2018T16:23:30,CrimsonQuill,"You talked about mayonaise. I'm a bit tired, and when tired, my brain goes loopy-loo la-la. I thought, what comes to mind with mayonaise? The first thing I think goes with mayonaise is a potato. And I cooked two potatoes with dinner tonight."
22-11-2018T16:23:59,CrimsonQuill,"Unfortunately, rather than saying something sensible, I just typed in the word, 'Potatoes', in block capitals."
22-11-2018T16:24:12,CrimsonQuill,Because my brain's a bit of a mush at the moment.
22-11-2018T16:24:18,CrimsonQuill,"So, my apologies."

22-11-2018T21:03:58,SageSaga,Picarto recommended settings include using the CPU encoder and not the GPU
22-11-2018T21:04:09,Bgrmystr2,ew
22-11-2018T21:04:25,SageSaga,im guessing its because some people dont HAVE a GPU?
22-11-2018T21:04:28,BadFoMo,The what and what?
22-11-2018T21:04:32,Bgrmystr2,yeah probably sage

22-11-2018T21:05:01,SageSaga,granted- my CPU is no slouch either
22-11-2018T21:05:12,Bgrmystr2,a lot of people have garbage GPUs.. being that laptops in general tend to not have dedicated GPUs unless it's halfass decent
22-11-2018T21:05:30,SageSaga,OBS maxed out at CPU use 3.8% i think- and that was spikes-
22-11-2018T21:05:37,SageSaga,now its like 1.2%
22-11-2018T21:05:52,Bgrmystr2,I'd never run streams off my CPU since it's from 09
22-11-2018T21:06:02,Bgrmystr2,but a 760 should be just fine

22-11-2018T21:12:53,MrMongMong,"Farewell. Also, it is nice to know there is at least one other person without money to donate. :)"
22-11-2018T21:13:18,KiTA,"heh, stockings and lengerie..."
22-11-2018T21:13:22,SableArts,Are her stockings just a band around her thighs and then nothing below that?
22-11-2018T21:13:26,Bgrmystr2,"a lot of people who come to the stream can't donate, Mong"
22-11-2018T21:13:29,BadFoMo,Gasp! Sage! Tom is trying to make bootleg Nyan pellows! Sue him!
22-11-2018T21:13:29,Bgrmystr2,it's not really uncommon
22-11-2018T21:13:32,KiTA,Having built in stockings and lingerie would be an interesting fur pattern for an anthro
22-11-2018T21:14:02,ZRO4825,!!! Tom-drawn Nyna? Nice! <3
22-11-2018T21:14:39,SageSaga,Tom has drawn her several times now

22-11-2018T21:18:11,Twokinds,Does this look alright Sage?
22-11-2018T21:18:41,SageSaga,everything except... Nyna doesn't wear underwear...
22-11-2018T21:18:52,superwolfart,^^
22-11-2018T21:19:05,Twokinds,Well... it is a special occassion
22-11-2018T21:19:06,SageSaga,but i know you know that XD
22-11-2018T21:19:09,Twokinds,It's important to dress up!
22-11-2018T21:19:21,Twokinds,I know that you know that I know that
22-11-2018T21:19:32,superwolfart,cool

22-11-2018T21:20:14,BadFoMo,But do YOU know that he knows that you know that he knows that?
22-11-2018T21:20:16,SageSaga,there's a line on the boob that might make her look bustier than she is
22-11-2018T21:20:45,Bgrmystr2,I dunno looks okay to me sage
22-11-2018T21:21:26,SageSaga,Nyna is probably flatter than flora- probably because i cant tell how much fur adds to her size XD
22-11-2018T21:26:43,Tharkis,rawr :ctharkis-earwiggle:
22-11-2018T21:26:51,FoxxTrotter,"Hi again, Tharkis."

22-11-2018T21:28:26,FoxxTrotter,"Yes, plenty of turkey yesterday. I also watched some parts of ""The Haunting of Hill House"" series. Quite interesting."
22-11-2018T21:28:39,Twokinds,It's all be one of my cousin's birthdays!

22-11-2018T21:29:44,SageSaga,"Tom has 362 cousins - each born on a different day- the other days are his brother, his and his sister"
22-11-2018T21:30:09,BadFoMo,Sister?!
22-11-2018T21:30:15,FoxxTrotter,He has the year covered.

22-11-2018T21:30:43,SupremeLeaderPorg,Well this is the first stream I have finally been able to see while it’s still live.       Also happy birthday early everyone who seems to have a birthday tomorrow
22-11-2018T21:31:18,SageSaga,no one talks about his sister because she doesnt leave the house and isnt related by blood. She's also forever 17 and draws dirty pictures

22-11-2018T21:32:23,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, she sounds great, sage"
22-11-2018T21:32:25,SageSaga,I just turned Tom into the protag from Eromanga sensei
22-11-2018T21:32:44,BadFoMo,From what?
22-11-2018T21:33:04,SageSaga,it's text- i dont think i need to repeat myself?
22-11-2018T21:33:14,MoonDance,Coolzie
22-11-2018T21:33:38,Tharkis,roflmao.  i need to screenshot that Sage for later

22-11-2018T21:41:26,RyokoNeko,oh boy I haven't tuned in for a while. Picarto changed their video format eh?
22-11-2018T21:41:28,CrRAR,oo
22-11-2018T21:43:22,Z3ppl1n,who is he drawing?
22-11-2018T21:43:31,CrRAR,nyna
22-11-2018T21:43:34,BadFoMo,Nyna from AI
22-11-2018T21:44:53,Bgrmystr2,"no, Ryoko"
22-11-2018T21:44:54,Bgrmystr2,they didn't
22-11-2018T21:45:14,Bgrmystr2,it's still Flash / HTML5
22-11-2018T21:45:28,BadFoMo,"A little late, but; ""You're a Scaley, Nyna."""
22-11-2018T21:45:45,RyokoNeko,oooh I see. Maybe its something with my computer. I can't see both streams unless I make the screens small :(
22-11-2018T21:45:47,ZRO4825,"Always says HLS on my end. I figure that's just another way of saying HTML5 though, lol"
22-11-2018T21:47:06,Bgrmystr2,"HLS is html5 yeah, but not the same as mp4"
22-11-2018T21:47:15,Bgrmystr2,probably the codec
22-11-2018T21:48:08,MviluUatusun,"Well, I need to head off to bed.  I've got to get up early tomorrow and go to work.  I'll see y'all later."
22-11-2018T21:48:18,FoxxTrotter,"G'night, Mvilu."
22-11-2018T21:48:23,SageSaga,take care Mvilu
22-11-2018T21:49:07,CrRAR,bye mvilu
22-11-2018T21:49:27,MviluUatusun,"Thanks Foxx, Sage and RAR.  Y'all take care."
22-11-2018T21:57:32,SageSaga,I ran into a second shiny pokemon today
22-11-2018T21:58:26,BadFoMo,Cool?
22-11-2018T21:58:27,Kynum,did you exchange insurance info?
22-11-2018T21:58:51,SageSaga,it ran away so i didnt get a chance- or a chance to get it in a pokeball either
22-11-2018T21:59:03,Twokinds,Hit and run
22-11-2018T21:59:05,Kynum,wow
22-11-2018T21:59:05,SageSaga,i was tempted to use a masterball on it
22-11-2018T21:59:37,ZRO4825,I have never seen a shiny pokemon. Ever.
22-11-2018T22:00:31,Kynum,police should probably create some sort of pokeball for the capture of humans.
22-11-2018T22:00:34,Tharkis,"i dont play pogo or whatnot, but my cousin was totally geeking out over something like a shiny gengar with a hat and sunglasses on facebook"
22-11-2018T22:00:49,Tharkis,"i know he loves the purple monster , but i have no idea what those other things mean lol"
22-11-2018T22:01:35,BadFoMo,@Kynum Inb4 ???: That is my fetish.
22-11-2018T22:02:03,Kynum,lol
22-11-2018T22:04:17,Tharkis,cat sealeen and nyna should meet someday.
22-11-2018T22:04:26,Tharkis,"hey tha'ts a good sketch suggestion, i'll have to remember that"
22-11-2018T22:04:59,BadFoMo,Write it down?
22-11-2018T22:05:57,Twokinds,I need to go find out why the dogs are barking
22-11-2018T22:05:58,Twokinds,brb
22-11-2018T22:06:27,THETOXICATOR,Robbery
22-11-2018T22:06:32,BadFoMo,Dog: It's a thing! ...I found a thing!
22-11-2018T22:07:50,THETOXICATOR,What was it
22-11-2018T22:08:00,Combak,Hey all!
22-11-2018T22:08:04,BadFoMo,Yo.
22-11-2018T22:08:07,FoxxTrotter,"Hey, Combak."
22-11-2018T22:08:23,Tharkis,dogs were jealous tom draws so many cats and caused a ruckus... or they were just being dogs =)
22-11-2018T22:08:40,THETOXICATOR,Why where they barking?
22-11-2018T22:08:42,Combak,"Hey FoMo, Foxx."
22-11-2018T22:09:30,steelabjur,"Hi guys, is my wife going to yell at me about furry porn again? ;p"
22-11-2018T22:09:44,THETOXICATOR,Yup
22-11-2018T22:09:51,Alphawolf333,"eh, probably"
22-11-2018T22:10:06,Twokinds,Nobody's drawing furry stuff
22-11-2018T22:10:22,steelabjur,"Heh, yeah, that will probably do it. Worth it. ;)"
22-11-2018T22:10:29,Tharkis,kemono and monstergirls arent furry
22-11-2018T22:10:36,THETOXICATOR,Yeah bit it's probably his search history
22-11-2018T22:10:38,BadFoMo,This is only Gateway Furry stuff.
22-11-2018T22:11:28,steelabjur,"I don't have a search history, Toxicator. ;)"
22-11-2018T22:11:36,THETOXICATOR,Good
22-11-2018T22:11:38,ZRO4825,"If your wife is yelling at you about furry porn, you need a new wife."
22-11-2018T22:11:51,SageSaga,or a pillow
22-11-2018T22:11:53,THETOXICATOR,Neither do I
22-11-2018T22:11:58,ZRO4825,"Valid point, Sage."
22-11-2018T22:12:19,Bgrmystr2,I agree w/ zro. Unless she's yelling at you that you obviously were watching streams with furry art and she wanted to watch too.
22-11-2018T22:12:42,SageSaga,"she knocks on the door wondering why her keys dont work- you open the door holding your Waifu and you say ""you've been replaced"" and close the door"
22-11-2018T22:12:55,Bgrmystr2,haha wow
22-11-2018T22:13:04,Kynum,x3

22-11-2018T22:18:38,SageSaga,the day everyone gets together and hates me!
22-11-2018T22:19:12,SageSaga,on that day im just glad people can still work together on a single goal
22-11-2018T22:20:37,Tharkis,"in honor of Reiko, yesterday i didnt touch a single potato \o/"
22-11-2018T22:21:05,microbuss,I hate wind *roof flies off* SEE??
22-11-2018T22:21:12,SageSaga,i have sworn off Potatoes!
22-11-2018T22:21:23,microbuss,y??
22-11-2018T22:21:36,SageSaga,mostly because of my Diet but Rieko doesnt like them- they traumatized her
22-11-2018T22:21:43,Tharkis,to be fair i didnt ahve any thrukey or pie or stuffinh eihrer
22-11-2018T22:21:44,microbuss,why??
22-11-2018T22:21:54,Tharkis,"holy crap, and i suddenly lost my ability to type"
22-11-2018T22:22:03,microbuss,same but I had chicken thigh & a leg
22-11-2018T22:22:04,SageSaga,almost like that memory about potatoes is linked to the lost memories of when she was beaten to death with a tire iron
22-11-2018T22:22:40,microbuss,I love potatoes! even Mr & Mrs Potato Head hehe
22-11-2018T22:22:49,SageSaga,Suddenly all my filler about Rieko and Potatoes got a lot darker
22-11-2018T22:23:09,microbuss,LOL
22-11-2018T22:23:37,microbuss,I played with a old Mr Potato Head when he still had a pipe!
22-11-2018T22:25:26,microbuss,"I likes hash browns, baked potatoes, french fries etc!"
22-11-2018T22:27:14,totallynotTrace,"baked potatoes w/ cream cheese, bacon, dill, hot sauce mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm"
22-11-2018T22:27:33,totallynotTrace,smoked paprika

22-11-2018T22:28:25,Combak,What's Trinitrotoluene got to do with anything?
22-11-2018T22:28:26,microbuss,"agree with you, Trace but the hot sauce"
22-11-2018T22:28:36,totallynotTrace,hi Foxx & Combak
22-11-2018T22:28:39,microbuss,but not the hot sauce*
22-11-2018T22:29:31,totallynotTrace,yeah hot suace might be a bit much w/ paprika but it also depends on how spicey it is. I dont like super spicy potatoes. just very zippy at most
22-11-2018T22:30:03,microbuss,same
22-11-2018T22:30:11,totallynotTrace,also who is split tail woman on Toms stream?

22-11-2018T22:31:39,microbuss,that WAS supposed to burn you XD
22-11-2018T22:32:18,ZRO4825,I love how Tom drawing people who aren't from his own comic gives away who all doesn't pay attention to Sage's side of the stream. :joy:
22-11-2018T22:32:47,microbuss,plus I haven't had those in YEARS along with the tacos at the local mexicanj food place
22-11-2018T22:32:52,totallynotTrace,lvl up point applied to mouth burn resistance through repeated burning

22-11-2018T22:33:47,totallynotTrace,my cpu doesnt like watching two streams at once
22-11-2018T22:33:57,Tharkis,"in fact, i've got commissions from every artist i think i've ever seen in a friday multistream here \o/"
22-11-2018T22:34:05,Tharkis,i like supporting my artists when i can

22-11-2018T23:03:42,Combak,Ha
22-11-2018T23:03:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,what a waste of candy
22-11-2018T23:03:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d find a picture but that’d take a bit and no links in chat

22-11-2018T23:41:50,RimaDraws,i think when i have enough money saved ill get a good game system
22-11-2018T23:42:29,SageSaga,a PC?
22-11-2018T23:42:39,RimaDraws,no ps4

22-11-2018T23:44:22,SageSaga,yeah it sucks on everything
22-11-2018T23:44:23,RimaDraws,the one i want is $1800
22-11-2018T23:45:07,SageSaga,build one that can be upgraded

22-11-2018T23:45:12,Combak,"Man Tom, you're going nuts on that background."
22-11-2018T23:45:15,RimaDraws,i dont want to build one
22-11-2018T23:45:23,Tharkis,none of my friends who have bought it have much good to say about it either
22-11-2018T23:45:35,SageSaga,why not build one?
22-11-2018T23:45:37,SageSaga,its fun!
22-11-2018T23:45:38,Tharkis,"i was going to pick it up and play it while i was on vacation but i skipped it, first fallout i wont have played"
22-11-2018T23:45:51,RimaDraws,i can care less what people think about 76 i just want to play new games. and building a pc is just not for me
22-11-2018T23:46:03,RimaDraws,i dont want to have to get spare parts just to build one
22-11-2018T23:46:06,Combak,You including the other spin-offs Tharkis? Brotherhood of Steel games and what not?
22-11-2018T23:46:06,SageSaga,dont knock it till you try it
22-11-2018T23:46:12,RimaDraws,i like one that comes in one piece
22-11-2018T23:46:16,RimaDraws,simple
22-11-2018T23:46:20,SageSaga,there's no such thing
22-11-2018T23:46:25,Combak,"Ah, so you're a Mac. :p"
22-11-2018T23:46:26,SageSaga,all computers are pieces
22-11-2018T23:46:27,RimaDraws,im not a computer whizz at building one
22-11-2018T23:46:32,RimaDraws,excuse me...
22-11-2018T23:46:37,Tharkis,building a PC is pretty simple
22-11-2018T23:46:44,RimaDraws,i own a windows and a mac thank you very much
22-11-2018T23:46:48,SageSaga,building one is easy and educational and fun!
22-11-2018T23:46:48,RimaDraws,and i dont appreciate that comment
22-11-2018T23:46:52,SageSaga,and cheaper
22-11-2018T23:47:04,Combak,I'm talking design philosophy.
22-11-2018T23:47:17,RimaDraws,it shouldn't matter what i am combak
22-11-2018T23:47:30,RimaDraws,there are just preferences that i have
22-11-2018T23:48:12,Combak,"And once again, I am simply noting what design philosophy appeals or applies better to you. No judgement call, just a note."
22-11-2018T23:48:17,Tharkis,"i ought to build a new PC sometime soon, this one i'm on now i built when planetside 2 came out"
22-11-2018T23:48:25,Combak,"If you feel offened, that's you're problem, not mine."
22-11-2018T23:48:25,Tharkis,"and since that just turned 6 years old, i guess i'm due an upgrade hehe"
22-11-2018T23:48:33,RimaDraws,i may consider building sage but i need to talk to tech friends if i can find any
22-11-2018T23:48:45,SageSaga,watch Linus Tech Tips
22-11-2018T23:49:09,Tharkis,"anadtech and tomshardware have great guides on what's the newest , what's the best bang for the buck, etc"
22-11-2018T23:49:21,RimaDraws,uh
22-11-2018T23:49:35,qwe304,i helped my dad build his pc last week
22-11-2018T23:49:48,SageSaga,"i dont trust Tomshardware since they dont even have Tom anymore and - well since they said ""Just buy it"" about a video card that wasnt out yet"
22-11-2018T23:49:53,CrRAR,nicee
22-11-2018T23:50:08,Tharkis,"hrm, tbh i havent used them in... 6 years since ib uilt this computer lol =P"
22-11-2018T23:50:15,Tharkis,sad if tomshardware has gone downhill
22-11-2018T23:50:21,Tharkis,they used to be the best impartial source
22-11-2018T23:50:58,qwe304,last one he had built himself had an i386
22-11-2018T23:51:32,qwe304,im sure theres plenty of people happy to give you tips or advice about building a pc around here
22-11-2018T23:51:36,Bgrmystr2,"all pcs are parts, just because someone builds it for you doesn't mean it isn't the same parts"
22-11-2018T23:51:50,Bgrmystr2,"learning experiences are good, not bad"
22-11-2018T23:52:03,Tharkis,"""experience is what you get, when you dont get what you want"""
22-11-2018T23:52:19,Bgrmystr2,"well, sometimes you get what you want and get experience too"
22-11-2018T23:52:38,Bgrmystr2,but yeah failure is the best teacher
22-11-2018T23:52:41,ZRO4825,Buying new parts right now myself! ^_^
22-11-2018T23:52:54,RimaDraws,@SageSaga what playlist is it under
22-11-2018T23:52:56,ZRO4825,And gonna get a Switch for Xmas so I can play Smash Ultimate and MHGU! =D
22-11-2018T23:53:15,Bgrmystr2,"about to potentially get some hardware parts for my friend as well, replacing his motherboard"
22-11-2018T23:54:16,qwe304,@Tharkis what do you do/want to do with your pc?
22-11-2018T23:54:25,MrEase,yeah I really need to get myself a switch soon
22-11-2018T23:54:34,SageSaga,any of Linus Tech Tips PC building guides is good- for latest hardware though - well- what do you want it to do?
22-11-2018T23:55:11,ZRO4825,Just don't listen to The Verge for a build guide. :rofl:
22-11-2018T23:55:12,qwe304,kek i was gonna ask for a switch for christmas then I found out CEMU existed
22-11-2018T23:55:15,Bgrmystr2,"for the most part, ryzen is super cheap, they have some of the best per dollar cpus out there"
22-11-2018T23:55:18,Bgrmystr2,rofl zro xD
22-11-2018T23:55:50,SageSaga,Linus Tech Tips recently did a best value breakdown for 3 different types of systems
22-11-2018T23:55:59,Bgrmystr2,yeah they did
22-11-2018T23:56:00,SageSaga,Ryzen won a lot
22-11-2018T23:56:06,SpazztasticKiwi,She’s so lovely Tom
22-11-2018T23:56:06,RimaDraws,there is one video that says $1000 Gaming PC Building guide
22-11-2018T23:56:14,Bgrmystr2,yeah Ryzen won everything that wasn't things that rely on a single CPU thread
22-11-2018T23:56:15,qwe304,"i didnt like that one sage,"
22-11-2018T23:56:16,SageSaga,is it a year old?
22-11-2018T23:56:22,FoxxTrotter,"I'm off for the night. Later, everyone. :0)"
22-11-2018T23:56:31,Bgrmystr2,and intel only won that by what.. 5-15%?
22-11-2018T23:56:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,nighty night foxx
22-11-2018T23:56:35,DeanFox,this looks cool!

22-11-2018T23:56:38,SageSaga,the 1000 dollar gaming PC is a good one if its the one i think it is
22-11-2018T23:56:38,RimaDraws,may 3 2017 sage
22-11-2018T23:56:41,Bgrmystr2,gnight foxx
22-11-2018T23:56:49,qwe304,they went with cpus that were like 30% more expensive that had 10% more performance
22-11-2018T23:56:55,Tharkis,"mmm, cozy looking fire.  Now i want to curl up by a fire.   It's been way too cold for november"
22-11-2018T23:57:21,Twokinds,I'm not sure why she's wearing this fancy underwear in the woods
22-11-2018T23:57:24,SageSaga,like what Que?
22-11-2018T23:57:30,Bgrmystr2,the house I moved into earlier this year doesn't have a fireplace.
22-11-2018T23:57:32,Bgrmystr2,feels bad
22-11-2018T23:57:38,Bgrmystr2,I miss having one :(
22-11-2018T23:57:40,SageSaga,Tom- Nyna does everything in the woods
22-11-2018T23:58:21,RimaDraws,so sage is that the right one? in may 2017?
22-11-2018T23:58:21,SageSaga,except poop and stuff- because no one poops in the world
22-11-2018T23:58:29,SageSaga,yes Rima
22-11-2018T23:58:29,Bgrmystr2,"but sage.... if she fell in the woods with noone around, does she make a sound?"
22-11-2018T23:58:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Because single ladies like to dance alone in pretty underwear for run
22-11-2018T23:58:36,RimaDraws,okay ill definitely look it up
22-11-2018T23:58:40,SageSaga,Bgr - of course
22-11-2018T23:58:41,Tharkis,AI... a world without restrooms!
22-11-2018T23:58:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"Pssst, Sage is Nyna single?"
22-11-2018T23:58:51,Bgrmystr2,but noone was there to hear it :OOO
22-11-2018T23:58:56,SageSaga,Read the comic and find out!
22-11-2018T23:58:58,Tharkis,"bah read the comic, you'd know she's not single, Kaylin has claim to her ! =D"
22-11-2018T23:59:00,Bgrmystr2,so.. how do we know?
22-11-2018T23:59:02,SpazztasticKiwi,fun

22-11-2018T23:59:26,qwe304,"@SageSaga I assume you are talking about their ""what cpu to buy -late 2018"" video"
22-11-2018T23:59:33,Tharkis,Sage-ooh i like that even better =D
22-11-2018T23:59:55,Bgrmystr2,"lol tharkis, if you read the comic, you'd know :V"
