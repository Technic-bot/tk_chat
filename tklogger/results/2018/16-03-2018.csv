16-03-2018T00:01:37,Bgrmystr2,"that'll be the anime they put out one episode, put a kickstarter to see if anyone was interested in it"
16-03-2018T00:01:41,Bgrmystr2,and it got funded
16-03-2018T00:01:58,Bgrmystr2,so they made a full season of it
16-03-2018T00:02:01,Bgrmystr2,from what I know of
16-03-2018T00:02:13,Bgrmystr2,"might be more to the story than that, but that's what I know of"
16-03-2018T00:02:13,BadFoMo,Huh...
16-03-2018T00:03:12,Bgrmystr2,okay it was for the film

16-03-2018T00:03:53,Bgrmystr2,but yeah that's the thing
16-03-2018T00:04:40,Vatruvius,"Aww...man, just as I upgrade to wifi the stream is over. Curse you AT&T!"

16-03-2018T00:36:34,SageSaga,cool. Yeah im not going to walk you through it and they do a fine job of explaining it. You must be missing something

16-03-2018T00:43:13,unsteddyphoenix,"Get yourself a ""can do"" attitude! You CAN take all these drugs! Never give up!"
16-03-2018T00:43:54,LukeWolfenstein,"i cant show, if you know how, i can show"
16-03-2018T00:44:19,SageSaga,so is English not your first language?
16-03-2018T00:44:45,LukeWolfenstein,i russian :D
16-03-2018T00:44:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Well slow down
16-03-2018T00:45:02,SageSaga,ok - Do you draw with a pen?
16-03-2018T00:45:25,LukeWolfenstein,nope....i have less money (
16-03-2018T00:45:34,SageSaga,a pencil?
16-03-2018T00:45:35,LukeWolfenstein,only mouse
16-03-2018T00:45:47,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
16-03-2018T00:46:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"But that’s cool, though - gotta be difficult learning English"
16-03-2018T00:46:08,Bgrmystr2,is it safe to say that's the problem?
16-03-2018T00:46:12,SageSaga,ok well a mouse cant do pressure sensitivity unless you use a trick- something like - LazyNezumi i think can do that
16-03-2018T00:46:18,TheBeckoner,Mice cant draw well I hear.
16-03-2018T00:46:39,Mihari,They can if you have the RIGHT mouse! :3
16-03-2018T00:46:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I have a left mouse
16-03-2018T00:46:59,Bgrmystr2,you'd need an extremely sensitive mouse for that
16-03-2018T00:47:03,LukeWolfenstein,ok...then how make it?
16-03-2018T00:47:15,unsteddyphoenix,Just use pencil and paper?
16-03-2018T00:47:34,TheBeckoner,charcoal and a hard surface?
16-03-2018T00:47:37,Mihari,"There is this one dual mouse on kickstarter right now, it looks neat."
16-03-2018T00:47:41,SageSaga,im able to get smooth lines because im drawing with a tablet pen.
16-03-2018T00:47:57,SageSaga,it's just like drawing with a real life pen or pencil
16-03-2018T00:51:10,LukeWolfenstein,i like draw real mechanic pensil on the paper....very like :3
16-03-2018T00:52:05,SageSaga,whew- all done

16-03-2018T00:53:09,SageSaga,its nice to lean back in my chair- i gotta find a new chair with better back support when leaning forward- or i need to get something for my desk to pull my tablet closer-
16-03-2018T00:53:47,Bgrmystr2,I think pulling your tablet closer would be better for your body positioning
16-03-2018T00:54:03,Bgrmystr2,"cuz sitting for long periods of time in a bad position, even with support, is still bad"
16-03-2018T00:54:10,SageSaga,well i put it right at the edge of my desk but i still gotta lean over it- a bit-
16-03-2018T00:54:46,Bgrmystr2,yeh

16-03-2018T11:22:14,Vatruvius,Hmm...I am in an introductory programming class right now. I can create bouncing 2d balls. :D But from what we have learned it would bot be that difficult. A rather short program.
16-03-2018T11:31:11,Vatruvius,lol...not*
16-03-2018T11:42:23,Vatruvius,"I jusr got a good idea for a sketch, though I already submitted one for this Sunday. What do you guys think about King Leonidas Adelaide?"
16-03-2018T11:42:33,Vatruvius,just*
16-03-2018T15:32:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Ford Lincoln MKZ’s and Fusion’s (2014-2018) are being recalled
16-03-2018T15:44:31,Bgrmystr2,a bot to record the chat would be an extremely simple program
16-03-2018T16:07:16,kts,"Vatruvius, that's a nice concept"
16-03-2018T16:32:19,qwe304,"would it be spoilers to request a sketch that recreates somthing that we know happened in cannon, but was never illustrated?"
16-03-2018T16:34:05,qwe304,"we were told about the event early on, but never had it illistrated"
16-03-2018T16:42:21,kts,i think that can be counted as spoiler
16-03-2018T17:31:13,qwe304,:(
16-03-2018T17:50:28,Bgrmystr2,Depends on what it is qwe
16-03-2018T17:50:39,Bgrmystr2,"cuz if it's spoiler territory, then yknow, yeah, spoilers"
16-03-2018T17:50:48,Bgrmystr2,but just cuz it wasn't drawn does not guarentee it's a spoiler
16-03-2018T18:04:25,Vatruvius,What is Adelaide's history? I heard she tipped over a tower by herself when fighting with the east but I do not know much else.
16-03-2018T18:30:20,qwe304,i want to know the circumstances surrounding floras original capture
16-03-2018T18:32:41,Bgrmystr2,"that, I dunno qwe"
16-03-2018T18:32:49,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, something like.."
16-03-2018T18:32:55,Bgrmystr2,trace's parents probably wouldn't be spoilers
16-03-2018T18:33:04,Bgrmystr2,and there isn't much about that
16-03-2018T18:33:17,Bgrmystr2,"but trace's past and other stuff, dragon lore, etc"
16-03-2018T18:33:30,Bgrmystr2,"all that stuff isn't written either, and it's likely a big bunch of spoilers"
16-03-2018T18:33:59,Bgrmystr2,flora's original capture could have lore behind it
16-03-2018T18:34:07,Vatruvius,Flora had to have been captured at a very young age. It also seems that her parents were killed when she was captured.
16-03-2018T18:34:14,Bgrmystr2,yeah
16-03-2018T18:34:18,Bgrmystr2,and we don't know by who
16-03-2018T18:34:21,kts,yup
16-03-2018T18:35:45,Bgrmystr2,"it's hinted at a few times in the story, early on, but there's no telling if what happened is a spoiler or not"
16-03-2018T18:35:47,Vatruvius,The reason why a lot of this stuff is not drawn or known is because it will come back later like a flashback. Similar to the one with Laura and Trace.
16-03-2018T18:36:02,Bgrmystr2,not always
16-03-2018T18:36:07,Bgrmystr2,not everything happens like that
16-03-2018T18:36:16,Bgrmystr2,trace's parents may never be a flashback point
16-03-2018T18:36:25,Bgrmystr2,they may never be relevant to the plot at all
16-03-2018T18:36:58,Vatruvius,Right...if not then they may become canon sketchs.
16-03-2018T18:37:24,kts,what about a sketch about the first meeting of Mike and Evans with Eric?
16-03-2018T18:38:17,Bgrmystr2,evals* and
16-03-2018T18:38:22,Bgrmystr2,yeah that may not be spoiler
16-03-2018T18:38:27,Bgrmystr2,that'd prolly be a good sketch
