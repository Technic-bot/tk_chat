09-01-2018T15:17:18,MidnightBlue78,^ I have been trying to make sense of this since yesterday
09-01-2018T15:17:29,MidnightBlue78,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
09-01-2018T15:23:41,RandomTKLover,Finally going to be on time for the stream today
09-01-2018T15:23:47,RandomTKLover,So happy
09-01-2018T15:23:57,TheBeckoner,It's/was a language me and CrRAR made up
09-01-2018T15:24:13,TheBeckoner,@MidnightBlue78
09-01-2018T15:29:09,RandomTKLover,Just replace vowels with other vowels?
09-01-2018T15:29:50,TheBeckoner,"Nah, its a language where you can only use ""t, h and e"" and sometimes ""y"""
09-01-2018T15:30:21,RandomTKLover,But you used a u
09-01-2018T15:30:49,TheBeckoner,hte?
09-01-2018T15:31:07,MidnightBlue78,Oh god üòí
09-01-2018T15:31:17,MidnightBlue78,why did I even mention it
09-01-2018T15:31:19,RandomTKLover,Ehyt. The
09-01-2018T15:31:35,RandomTKLover,Thy*
09-01-2018T15:32:17,TheBeckoner,Are yah saying you don't appreciate our fine dialect? hte??
09-01-2018T15:32:57,RandomTKLover,"Te te. Hyt yte ye teh tyee,"
09-01-2018T15:33:19,RandomTKLover,"So I respect it, but it is hard to use"
09-01-2018T15:34:30,TheBeckoner,It takes some getting used to. It also doesnt help that we haven't assigned meaning to anything.
09-01-2018T15:35:04,RandomTKLover,Or that we just make it up as we go
09-01-2018T15:36:14,RandomTKLover,&lt;so I‚Äôll just stick with keidran for now
09-01-2018T15:36:20,RandomTKLover,&gt;
09-01-2018T15:37:17,RandomTKLover,I have 7 streams to watch!?!
09-01-2018T15:37:35,RandomTKLover,"Wow, I didn‚Äôt think it was that many"
09-01-2018T16:17:13,Bgrmystr2,"you know, random, there's an addon called Picarto Notifier"
09-01-2018T16:17:17,Bgrmystr2,for your browser
09-01-2018T16:17:31,Bgrmystr2,and it'll notify you every time someone starts streaming
09-01-2018T16:18:00,Bgrmystr2,it's not 5-10 mins late or worse like the emails
09-01-2018T16:18:29,Bgrmystr2,and it's not 2-5mins late like the picarto notification window on the site itself
09-01-2018T16:18:37,Bgrmystr2,it's within about 30 seconds or so
09-01-2018T16:18:38,Bgrmystr2,if that.
09-01-2018T16:20:16,Bgrmystr2,For Firefox https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/picarto-notifier/?src=search
09-01-2018T16:20:25,Bgrmystr2,And for Chrome https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/picarto-notifier/fifjhakdmflgahkghkijipchfomdajfn?hl=en-US
09-01-2018T16:20:40,Bgrmystr2,Chrome links are retarded as fuck though
09-01-2018T16:21:26,TheBeckoner,asddjnasjnjsdgjrotgjkoi4 - What do you mean? //sarcasm
09-01-2018T16:21:41,TheBeckoner,Also thanks for the link
09-01-2018T16:22:02,Bgrmystr2,"I'd highly suggest at least one of them, that way when you're at your pc, it'll tell ya real quick"
09-01-2018T16:24:23,TheBeckoner,"I usually have the window open all the time, so I know when random music starts playing, or when the chat goes nuts, but a functioning alert system is nice too."
09-01-2018T16:27:48,Bgrmystr2,":thumbsup: I do both. I'm not always capable of looking at the stream window all the time, so that helps"
09-01-2018T17:00:42,MetalAppleSauce,better than the youtube and twitch notifs obviously
09-01-2018T17:01:10,MetalAppleSauce,twitch notifs about 5 minutes late and youtube notifies long after the stream ends
09-01-2018T17:39:38,TheFDdriver,Thats true
09-01-2018T19:03:34,RandomTKLover,"Sadly I don‚Äôt have a pc. The closest thing to it that I have is a chrome book for school. But they monitor everything you do on it, even at home, so I just use my phone or tablet"
09-01-2018T19:04:10,RandomTKLover,By ‚Äúthey‚Äù I mean the school admins
09-01-2018T19:06:54,Bgrmystr2,how do you not have a computer? :thinking:
09-01-2018T19:22:59,MidnightBlue78,I think I'm gonna pass out before stream starts üò≠

09-01-2018T19:50:35,IAmAPie,How long until the stream starts?
09-01-2018T19:51:03,DarkLinnk,to be fair I think that market isnt filled with that many games

09-01-2018T20:40:18,DarkLinnk,I have no clue what youre talking about
09-01-2018T20:40:30,Deadman,palmetto state. the only one you can throw into mud and dirt and not clean it and still fire it without jamming
09-01-2018T20:40:38,MidnightBlue78,"I am totally lost,sorry I can't help you"
09-01-2018T20:40:45,DarkLinnk,ohhh weapons
09-01-2018T20:40:46,Questionbox2018,ccw stands for concealed carry license but in indiana state law CCW and just a standard open carry are the same
09-01-2018T20:41:14,Deadman,I got my cwp the first week of december and went to psa to buy my handgun that i carry
09-01-2018T20:41:14,Questionbox2018,yeah my dad also owns a palmetto state ar-15
09-01-2018T20:41:32,Questionbox2018,I can not purchase small arms yet becuase I am not 21

09-01-2018T20:41:40,DarkLinnk,well since im german I can recommend a Luger :ptv-kippi2:
09-01-2018T20:41:41,Questionbox2018,however I can purchase long arms
09-01-2018T20:41:54,Questionbox2018,i-is that kappa
09-01-2018T20:42:14,Deadman,lugers are nice. id like to get one eventually but i really want a dragunov svd first
09-01-2018T20:42:36,Questionbox2018,I have really been eyeballing a few weapons
09-01-2018T20:42:38,RandomTKLover,"I have long arms, I can reach out really far"
09-01-2018T20:42:44,RandomTKLover,:ptv-condescending:
09-01-2018T20:42:46,MidnightBlue78,XD
09-01-2018T20:42:51,PalmettoPathfinder1,Hooray for concealed weapons permits!  Those who have one will become the militia against evil!
09-01-2018T20:43:09,Questionbox2018,I kinda wanna get a .22 takedown becuase .22 cal is so fricking cheap
09-01-2018T20:43:19,Questionbox2018,I can mag dump and only spend like 2 cents
09-01-2018T20:43:21,RandomTKLover,"Omfg, Americans and their guns"
09-01-2018T20:43:37,MidnightBlue78,not all of them
09-01-2018T20:43:40,Questionbox2018,I was raised around firearms
09-01-2018T20:43:44,Questionbox2018,yeah not all of them
09-01-2018T20:43:49,MidnightBlue78,I don't have guns
09-01-2018T20:43:50,Questionbox2018,you got californians and new yorkers
09-01-2018T20:43:51,DarkLinnk,admires the german guns from WW2
09-01-2018T20:43:52,PalmettoPathfinder1,Nothing wrong with us Americans  loving and respecting our guns.
09-01-2018T20:43:58,Questionbox2018,^
09-01-2018T20:44:03,Deadman,my mom and stepdad are both pacifists/antigun
09-01-2018T20:44:12,Questionbox2018,2A protects the 1A
09-01-2018T20:44:38,Questionbox2018,but again my upringing was around firearms
09-01-2018T20:44:49,RandomTKLover,"They actually have nothing to do with each other, have you even read the constitution/Amendments"
09-01-2018T20:44:55,MidnightBlue78,"I'm not antigen or anything, it's just never interested me"
09-01-2018T20:44:55,RandomTKLover,?
09-01-2018T20:45:08,Deadman,mine kinda was but theres only like 2 people in my family that know as much as i do about them and thats cause theyre military
09-01-2018T20:45:34,RandomTKLover,"I can see what you mean, 2 protects 1"
09-01-2018T20:45:35,MidnightBlue78,*antigun
09-01-2018T20:45:38,Questionbox2018,second amendment allows the assembly of militia
09-01-2018T20:45:45,PalmettoPathfinder1,Nothing wrong with someone using a gun to hunt or protect their loved ones but I don't agree that people need to own an AK 47 or an uzi.  If you're a gun collector you need to make sure those weapons are disabled.  They make something that can make them
09-01-2018T20:45:46,RandomTKLover,But the government has no intentions on taking away our rights
09-01-2018T20:46:05,PalmettoPathfinder1,To be impossible to use again but don't damage the value of the weapons.
09-01-2018T20:46:11,DarkLinnk,*graps Popcorn*
09-01-2018T20:46:14,Questionbox2018,its always good to be protected
09-01-2018T20:46:19,RandomTKLover,XD dl
09-01-2018T20:46:36,Questionbox2018,automatics I agree with you sorta...
09-01-2018T20:46:39,Questionbox2018,and heres why
09-01-2018T20:46:47,Deadman,the funny thing about the fully auto weapons is if people really want them theyll just produce them themselves. when people are determined to do something they'll find a way
09-01-2018T20:46:47,Questionbox2018,I have actually fired automatic weapons
09-01-2018T20:46:49,zolstarym,2A doesn't protect anything. Only people who care do. The  gov has removed rights before without problems
09-01-2018T20:47:23,Questionbox2018,"mp5, 1919, tec-9 etc."
09-01-2018T20:47:30,PalmettoPathfinder1,Btw I've realized something: would Nora like Trace if Trace was a woman?
09-01-2018T20:47:38,zolstarym,"During WW2 japs were rounded up into camps with no due process, during civil war habeus corpus was suspended, patriot act, etc"
09-01-2018T20:47:41,RandomTKLover,The fcc did that against democracy and are being punished for it
09-01-2018T20:47:45,Deadman,i got to shoot a fully auto thompson sub machine gun while at psa one day i felt like a 1920's gangster and it was great
09-01-2018T20:47:45,DarkLinnk,Hey I already went through this conversation with my multi-culture ts it was amazing
09-01-2018T20:47:58,DarkLinnk,RTKL
09-01-2018T20:48:05,Questionbox2018,and what I've learned is... they are very unviable in terms of combat
09-01-2018T20:48:17,Questionbox2018,semi auto and 2 round burst is all you need
09-01-2018T20:48:17,PalmettoPathfinder1,Also here is the link to Wingin It: https://kissdragonkiss.itch.io/wingin-it
09-01-2018T20:48:38,RandomTKLover,"I follow the armored skeptic school of thought, so in my opinion, your rights end where other people‚Äôs lives begin"
09-01-2018T20:48:41,Questionbox2018,but it only takes one bullet to stop anything in its path
09-01-2018T20:48:44,Deadman,thats what most of americas military has been tending to change to is 3 round burst or semi.
09-01-2018T20:49:39,PalmettoPathfinder1,Gasp!  LESBIAN DRAGONS!
09-01-2018T20:49:48,PalmettoPathfinder1,To everyone's left!
09-01-2018T20:49:54,RandomTKLover,Im not even gonna look
09-01-2018T20:49:55,Questionbox2018,im confused what about lesbian dragon
09-01-2018T20:49:56,Deadman,Looks left for dragons
09-01-2018T20:49:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:
09-01-2018T20:50:13,RandomTKLover,XD
09-01-2018T20:50:17,MidnightBlue78,Theyre talking about the link
09-01-2018T20:50:32,Deadman,awwww... why you killin my dreams here guy? lol
09-01-2018T20:51:22,DarkLinnk,mhh apparently in germany im not allowed to own a FULL-auto weapon
09-01-2018T20:51:27,PalmettoPathfinder1,that and I just found out that a few dragons in the Wings of Fire series by Sutherland are gay (one gay male dragon and three female lesbian dragons...possibly four lesbian dragons)
09-01-2018T20:51:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"@Questionbox2018 are you new here, I don't recognize?"
09-01-2018T20:52:09,Questionbox2018,I am not new per say
09-01-2018T20:52:21,Questionbox2018,but in the means of actually talking in this chat yes
09-01-2018T20:52:22,MidnightBlue78,in the chat yes
09-01-2018T20:52:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,then you get this
09-01-2018T20:52:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hugs Questionbox Welcome
09-01-2018T20:52:42,PalmettoPathfinder1,I guess in a way dragons would be okay with homosexuality as long as the gay dragon has children in the meantime.  I guess dragons are okay with having multiple lovers.
09-01-2018T20:52:50,Questionbox2018,mostly I just cast this stream to the discord and discus with my friends whats going on
09-01-2018T20:52:58,Questionbox2018,nice

09-01-2018T20:54:25,Questionbox2018,is it gonna start tonight?
09-01-2018T20:54:30,Deadman,put vaseline in your nose palmetto it'll help moisturize it and keep it from bleeding during cold or dry weather
09-01-2018T20:54:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,wait until twister and dinosaurs get involved

09-01-2018T20:55:29,MidnightBlue78,"Dev has been quiet, I think he's really tired today"
09-01-2018T20:55:30,Deadman,great movie
09-01-2018T20:55:33,Dadrobit,Feelin' good about the stream tonight.
09-01-2018T20:55:45,PalmettoPathfinder1,I sneezed on my phone and I got blood on it.   Allergies + cold weather = dried out nose = bloody nose
09-01-2018T20:56:04,Questionbox2018,oh speaking of which am I not looking in the right areas or does tom have virtually no merch aside from his books
09-01-2018T20:56:19,PalmettoPathfinder1,I got to take some mucinex.
09-01-2018T20:56:27,Questionbox2018,I hate allergies
09-01-2018T20:56:33,Dadrobit,"Oh yeah, it's horridly cold out. Went outside this morning for the paper and I EVEN SAW MY BREATH!!! Wtf is this world coming to!?!?!?"
09-01-2018T20:56:34,DarkLinnk,I think if we could gather enough people we could get a Nora Plushie
09-01-2018T20:56:36,MidnightBlue78,Just the books
09-01-2018T20:56:44,Questionbox2018,rip
09-01-2018T20:56:50,BadFoMo,"@Questionbox2018 Nothing yet but the books, sorry."
09-01-2018T20:56:55,DarkLinnk,or a Plushie in general
09-01-2018T20:56:59,Questionbox2018,I was hoping for like a chibi flora keychain or something
09-01-2018T20:57:16,MidnightBlue78,I don't know if plushies will ever be a thing
09-01-2018T20:57:28,BadFoMo,I'm hopping for a prinably game.
09-01-2018T20:57:31,Dadrobit,"Plushies were a thing that were supposed to be an actual thing, but it kinda went by the wayside."
09-01-2018T20:57:39,DarkLinnk,I can dream atleast :ptv-whiny:
09-01-2018T20:57:40,BadFoMo,*printable

09-01-2018T20:57:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,nibbly plushi
09-01-2018T20:58:04,MidnightBlue78,Oh really? Too expensive?
09-01-2018T20:58:11,PalmettoPathfinder1,Well for those who just got on: anyone know of any dragon dating sim games?  So Far Angels with Scaly Wings is one of them.
09-01-2018T20:58:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I was just saying what I want
09-01-2018T20:58:20,Deadman,if he makes plushies i'll buy them for show
09-01-2018T20:58:26,Dadrobit,Go to one of his cons and pick up a bookmark?
09-01-2018T20:58:53,MidnightBlue78,I would spend a fortune just trying to go to a con
09-01-2018T20:59:02,MidnightBlue78,XD
09-01-2018T20:59:07,Dadrobit,"They were a goal in his KickStarter years ago, they just didn't happen."
09-01-2018T20:59:15,MidnightBlue78,and then only have money for a bookmark
09-01-2018T20:59:27,MidnightBlue78,That sucks
09-01-2018T20:59:40,BadFoMo,@MidnightBlue78 I think the plushies aren't a thing do to no sewing skills.
09-01-2018T20:59:48,BadFoMo,*due

09-01-2018T21:00:32,Dadrobit,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/twokinds/twokinds-book-printing-drive/posts/241539 found it. I think unfortunately Tom just didn't look into the logistics of custom ordering plushies before promising them. Shit's expensive yo.
09-01-2018T21:00:42,MidnightBlue78,"He's going to momocon, but not for work"
09-01-2018T21:00:44,PalmettoPathfinder1,One of Tom's kick starter goals was that he would update the comic twice a week.  That goal was met but then I think his hands started hurting after barely a week of doing it
09-01-2018T21:00:54,MidnightBlue78,Or so I read here in the chat
09-01-2018T21:01:12,Deadman,aww.. he usually goes to momocon for this.
09-01-2018T21:01:13,Dadrobit,He kept up the twice a week for a number of months.
09-01-2018T21:01:35,Bgrmystr2,he was probably pushing himself to draw even when he needed hand rest
09-01-2018T21:01:37,MidnightBlue78,"Yeah, things out of our control can happen"
09-01-2018T21:01:53,Bgrmystr2,and the results are as you see
09-01-2018T21:02:20,Deadman,hey anyone else in the chat watching agdq?
09-01-2018T21:02:35,Questionbox2018,agdq?

09-01-2018T21:02:38,PalmettoPathfinder1,yep.  I know that he was upset because he was unable to keep that promise but I understood that medical issues are one thing you can't always control so I'm okay with it

09-01-2018T21:29:40,Bgrmystr2,"Questionbox, ram is no more expensive than it was before."
09-01-2018T21:29:47,RandomTKLover,3 ys to wait :ptv-angry:
09-01-2018T21:29:48,Questionbox2018,wrong
09-01-2018T21:29:51,Bgrmystr2,not wrong
09-01-2018T21:29:55,Questionbox2018,very wrong
09-01-2018T21:29:57,Bgrmystr2,I'm looking at the prices right now.
09-01-2018T21:30:00,Deadman,and i got a free extra 4gbs from my former landlord
09-01-2018T21:30:08,TheFDdriver,I dont even know

09-01-2018T21:30:20,RandomTKLover,Landroid? XD haha
09-01-2018T21:30:23,Bgrmystr2,"they're exactly the same as they were when I bought ram a few years back, and several years back"
09-01-2018T21:30:26,Questionbox2018,I got a 16 gb kit for 50 dollars at ddr4
09-01-2018T21:30:40,Questionbox2018,they dont have heatspreaders but that doesnt matter that much
09-01-2018T21:30:40,Bgrmystr2,That's actually really cheap
09-01-2018T21:30:57,Questionbox2018,yeah for what I got yeah
09-01-2018T21:31:01,Questionbox2018,I look back at it now
09-01-2018T21:31:11,Questionbox2018,its 90 for the same kitr
09-01-2018T21:31:14,Bgrmystr2,"DDR4 is brand new, of course it's expensive. It has nothing to do with shortage. It's because demand."
09-01-2018T21:31:31,Deadman,where did you get it from? also ddr4 just recently dropped in price in the last year. cause a buddy of mine just built his first pc in the last year and used ddr4
09-01-2018T21:31:34,Questionbox2018,it came out in 2015
09-01-2018T21:31:38,TheFDdriver,and supply
09-01-2018T21:31:55,Bgrmystr2,"there's generally plenty of supply, but demand is huge, inflating the price"
09-01-2018T21:32:24,Bgrmystr2,"actual demand, people actually purchasing it, is much lower than the vocal demand for it"
09-01-2018T21:32:31,Bgrmystr2,so that's why theprice is high
09-01-2018T21:32:40,TheFDdriver,well at least is good
09-01-2018T21:32:44,Questionbox2018,nevermind I aint getting no where
09-01-2018T21:32:46,Questionbox2018,what a suprise
09-01-2018T21:32:47,Deadman,doesnt help that it uses more advanced techniques to make this stuff so rnd also has to be taken into account when dealing with price
09-01-2018T21:33:12,Bgrmystr2,yup
09-01-2018T21:33:19,Deadman,im listening questionbox. please continue

09-01-2018T21:56:47,Bgrmystr2,"the stream will be there when it happens, Angels, you'll sit there and be paitent like the rest of is."

09-01-2018T21:57:19,Questionbox2018,I couldnt even watch streams on phone because it required flash
09-01-2018T21:57:22,BadFoMo,PC Master Race?
09-01-2018T21:57:30,Questionbox2018,iphone doesnt support flash and my old phone was old and gay'
09-01-2018T21:57:31,Deadman,zeldas tricky to beat but corrin's pretty simple so long as i grab and stay away a lot.
09-01-2018T21:57:33,PalmettoPathfinder1,Just realized what if Flora is carrying....twins!
09-01-2018T21:57:51,RandomTKLover,Are you sure about that?
09-01-2018T21:57:56,TheFDdriver,that would be a turning point
09-01-2018T21:57:56,Questionbox2018,she's carrying the next loss comic
09-01-2018T21:58:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,twin xenomorphs
09-01-2018T21:58:04,Bgrmystr2,Tom said in the past that generally Keidran have multiple kids per birth
09-01-2018T21:58:07,Bgrmystr2,if I recall correctly
09-01-2018T21:58:08,Ordithus,Tigers often carry 4 (real tigers)
09-01-2018T21:58:09,MetalAppleSauce,average tiger litter is 3 or 4
09-01-2018T21:58:13,MetalAppleSauce,yeah that
09-01-2018T21:58:20,Ordithus,Poor Trace... little does he know.
09-01-2018T21:58:30,PalmettoPathfinder1,Well there you go!  And poor Trace.
09-01-2018T21:58:31,Bgrmystr2,so it stands to reason that there will be multiple
09-01-2018T21:58:32,TheFDdriver,IKR
09-01-2018T21:58:39,Bgrmystr2,it's not guarenteed
09-01-2018T21:58:42,Bgrmystr2,cuz we don't KNOW for sure
09-01-2018T21:58:42,RandomTKLover,Only 6 more years till we find out!
09-01-2018T21:58:55,Bgrmystr2,but it's prolly a good chance
09-01-2018T21:58:56,Questionbox2018,"""only one keidran will survive this war"""
09-01-2018T21:59:01,TheFDdriver,is not that far
09-01-2018T21:59:02,PalmettoPathfinder1,Six more years real life or comic book life?
09-01-2018T21:59:06,Deadman,sadly no ultra sound to prove one way or the other
09-01-2018T21:59:14,Bgrmystr2,"real life, Palm, obv"
09-01-2018T21:59:14,TheFDdriver,real live
09-01-2018T21:59:25,Bgrmystr2,the comic hasn't even reached one year in length in the story
09-01-2018T21:59:30,RandomTKLover,6 years in rl = 1 month in comic
09-01-2018T21:59:42,BadFoMo,@Deadman Detect Life Spell?
09-01-2018T21:59:44,RandomTKLover,Flora is in 2nd trimester
09-01-2018T21:59:57,RandomTKLover,Its been two months
09-01-2018T21:59:58,Ordithus,The past day has taken over a year :ptv-excited:
09-01-2018T22:00:03,TheFDdriver,so time is sloower on thr comic
09-01-2018T22:00:07,PalmettoPathfinder1,Making sure.   You can never be sure what with time skips being possible in comics.
09-01-2018T22:00:08,Deadman,that and she's already in her second trimester meaning she'll have them at the end of the next month. also this isnt dnd
09-01-2018T22:00:13,DarkLinnk,maybe  that baby  will some Beyong two souls stuff :ptv-confused:
09-01-2018T22:00:16,Bgrmystr2,time isn't slower in the comic
09-01-2018T22:00:17,Bgrmystr2,xD
09-01-2018T22:00:25,Bgrmystr2,he just updates it rarely
09-01-2018T22:00:40,RandomTKLover,He used to update every day
09-01-2018T22:00:40,MetalAppleSauce,once a week unless holiday or something else happens
09-01-2018T22:00:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Is Beyong two souls a movie?
09-01-2018T22:01:00,PalmettoPathfinder1,Well she might have a C section.
09-01-2018T22:01:00,Questionbox2018,its a game
09-01-2018T22:01:05,Ordithus,Twice a week on occasion
09-01-2018T22:01:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,it don't look like a game
09-01-2018T22:01:15,Bgrmystr2,"Palm, you think they have the medical science for that...?"
09-01-2018T22:01:22,Questionbox2018,well its like a telltale like game
09-01-2018T22:01:26,RandomTKLover,"Ppft, with their technology palomino?"

09-01-2018T22:02:36,RandomTKLover,That‚Äôs kinda how my comic starts
09-01-2018T22:02:36,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:
09-01-2018T22:02:38,Deadman,possibru but we dont know
09-01-2018T22:02:44,PalmettoPathfinder1,Actually according to what I've read C sections have been around since 300 BC
09-01-2018T22:02:50,Questionbox2018,hey thicc dad
09-01-2018T22:02:55,TheAngelsPlace,Uh oh
09-01-2018T22:02:59,RandomTKLover,Were they safe?
09-01-2018T22:03:01,BadFoMo,@Ordithus They got sucked into a time portal.
09-01-2018T22:03:15,Ordithus,That would explain a certain piece from the art book
09-01-2018T22:03:23,unsteddyphoenix,20 yewar timeskip baby grows up instantly
09-01-2018T22:03:24,BadFoMo,And landed in 2018!
09-01-2018T22:03:27,unsteddyphoenix,Takes over world
09-01-2018T22:03:33,PalmettoPathfinder1,Usually they were done if the mother was dying.
09-01-2018T22:03:34,Ordithus,2018 San Francisco!
09-01-2018T22:03:41,MetalAppleSauce,Magic-using Keidran? Last time we saw that natani got her soul ripped out of her

09-01-2018T22:03:51,TheFDdriver,they just skpping time
09-01-2018T22:03:53,Combak,"Guys, at the very least MacBeth referenced what we'd call a C-Section. The mother definitely died though."
09-01-2018T22:03:59,Kinipshun,or is it tom's artbook?
09-01-2018T22:04:05,Kinipshun,our artbook?
09-01-2018T22:04:05,MetalAppleSauce,Both
09-01-2018T22:04:21,Deadman,por que no los dos?
09-01-2018T22:04:30,TheFDdriver,no se
09-01-2018T22:04:32,BadFoMo,Magic is now just a myth. ...Or so the public thinks.
09-01-2018T22:04:33,RandomTKLover,:ptv-sad: i want an art book
09-01-2018T22:04:41,MetalAppleSauce,"If you draw in it, Tom immediately takes over your mind"
09-01-2018T22:04:49,Kinipshun,"i think magic exists, just in a much darker light"
09-01-2018T22:04:53,Questionbox2018,arent they like 50 bucks?
09-01-2018T22:05:01,PalmettoPathfinder1,But usually C sections were safe for the baby (usually) but not so much for the mother.  Which is why it was done on mothers who were dying.
09-01-2018T22:05:05,Kinipshun,like $36 i think
09-01-2018T22:05:09,Kinipshun,after tax
09-01-2018T22:05:09,TheFDdriver,who talks Spanish here?
09-01-2018T22:05:14,MetalAppleSauce,To avoid you copying his stuff he takes over your mind and posts it as his ;)
09-01-2018T22:05:15,Kinipshun,not me
09-01-2018T22:05:16,Questionbox2018,que?
09-01-2018T22:05:26,Deadman,yo no hablo espanol

09-01-2018T22:05:53,TheFDdriver,i know spanish
09-01-2018T22:06:01,Combak,Hablo un poco espanol.
09-01-2018T22:06:02,PalmettoPathfinder1,Of course they died of blood loss but this is a fantasy world so you could do a c section and heal the mother after delivering the baby.
09-01-2018T22:06:20,Deadman,i know murcan cause thats all i was born and raised to know.
09-01-2018T22:06:24,MetalAppleSauce,je ne parle pas espagnol

09-01-2018T22:10:23,Ordithus,"A mini basic comic, to make the comic"
09-01-2018T22:10:25,Twokinds,Thumbnailing is the process of roughly sketching out the layout of each page.
09-01-2018T22:10:26,TheBeckoner,"I'm super late, but it looks like thats ok. o/"
09-01-2018T22:10:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,oh

09-01-2018T22:11:21,Ordithus,"Me-ow, kinip"
09-01-2018T22:11:22,Twokinds,I hate it. So getting someone else to do scripts and prelim sketches would save a lot of time.
09-01-2018T22:11:25,Deadman,lol
09-01-2018T22:11:28,MidnightBlue78,how do you work on cats?
09-01-2018T22:11:33,Questionbox2018,I work 8 to 8 tomorrow

09-01-2018T22:12:12,Deadman,blow on it!!
09-01-2018T22:12:12,TheFDdriver,well you can say half and half Tom
09-01-2018T22:12:18,Ordithus,"I figured that scripts and sketches were the main creative parts, though.  The story."
09-01-2018T22:12:41,unsteddyphoenix,I think he means specific wording for the script
09-01-2018T22:12:48,BadFoMo,Why is it called 'Thumbnailing'? I thought it was called 'Sketching'.
09-01-2018T22:12:50,TheFDdriver,well it helps you understand
09-01-2018T22:12:51,Ordithus,Could be
09-01-2018T22:12:58,TheBeckoner,Alright I'll see y'all when the stream starts. bai erbody
09-01-2018T22:12:59,unsteddyphoenix,Where he'd still the overall leading creator

09-01-2018T22:13:34,ZizzoGaming,Ok then
09-01-2018T22:13:35,Twokinds,It's not writing the scripts or sketching the page. It's the inbetween part. The process of taking a sketch and breaking it down into 6-10 panel chunks and directing the scene and pacing for each panel.
09-01-2018T22:13:47,Kinipshun,zizzo you missed an awesome stream; it just ended
09-01-2018T22:14:01,TheFDdriver,too bad
09-01-2018T22:14:04,Twokinds,taking a script*
09-01-2018T22:14:09,Deadman,yeah the spacing is tough to do with a story
09-01-2018T22:14:13,BadFoMo,So it's like a storybord?
09-01-2018T22:14:15,MidnightBlue78,"sounds hard, i wanna cry now"
09-01-2018T22:14:17,ZizzoGaming,Oh dang. I'll get 'em next time.
09-01-2018T22:14:17,Ordithus,I see... kinda
09-01-2018T22:14:34,Deadman,@BadFoMo yeah basically
09-01-2018T22:14:35,unsteddyphoenix,You hate that bit? It sounds like one of the more interesting to me.
09-01-2018T22:14:35,Ordithus,Like a writer and director of photography for a movie
09-01-2018T22:14:41,TheFDdriver,it needs to be complex?
09-01-2018T22:15:39,Ordithus,Certainly isn't a task to hire out to just any one.
09-01-2018T22:15:45,TheFDdriver,or mind blowing?
09-01-2018T22:15:46,ZizzoGaming,So... what have I missed (if anything at all)?
09-01-2018T22:15:54,Kinipshun,nothing really zizz

09-01-2018T22:21:01,Bgrmystr2,so there's still plenty of time

09-01-2018T22:43:14,Kinipshun,"""reterdedly hard""..."
09-01-2018T22:43:23,Kinipshun,*ard
09-01-2018T22:43:59,TheBeckoner,Retardedly hard? Dont worry Ive worked on Chryslers... and you weren't condescending.

09-01-2018T23:39:32,Gelter,"it is usually here around 9, but tonight tom was not happy with his sketch/thumbnail thingy so it is delayed"
09-01-2018T23:39:39,Questionbox2018,Im trying to sub but it wont leave test mode
09-01-2018T23:39:48,TheFDdriver,unfortunately
09-01-2018T23:40:11,TheFDdriver,what is test mode
09-01-2018T23:40:17,TheFDdriver,¬ø?
09-01-2018T23:40:32,Bgrmystr2,"lol Gelter, he didn't say anything about being unhappy with it, just that it wasn't done yet"
09-01-2018T23:40:36,Bgrmystr2,"that I saw, anyway"
09-01-2018T23:40:50,Gelter,really?
09-01-2018T23:41:17,Gelter,ohh it was him being unhappy with having to do them becaus ehe hates doing them
09-01-2018T23:41:21,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, you'd have to have read what he said to make such a claim, yes?"
09-01-2018T23:41:22,Bgrmystr2,xD
09-01-2018T23:41:32,Gelter,i did read them
09-01-2018T23:41:44,Gelter,i just misunderstood
09-01-2018T23:44:00,MadMaxton,"Waitwaitwait, delayed? By how much? Did he say that?"
09-01-2018T23:44:34,Ordithus,However long it takes.
09-01-2018T23:44:56,Bgrmystr2,"no ETA, Maxton"
09-01-2018T23:45:11,TheFDdriver,it can take 1 2 or more hours
09-01-2018T23:45:46,Ordithus,Likely fewer than 10^100 hours though.
09-01-2018T23:46:03,MadMaxton,24 hours perhaps
09-01-2018T23:46:27,TheFDdriver,i dont know
09-01-2018T23:46:48,TheFDdriver,just leave that to Tom
09-01-2018T23:46:55,Bgrmystr2,"if he doesn't make it today, he'll probably stream tomorrow"
09-01-2018T23:46:59,Bgrmystr2,but for now we wait
09-01-2018T23:47:04,Bgrmystr2,cuz there's still time tonight
09-01-2018T23:47:10,TheFDdriver,yep
09-01-2018T23:47:25,TheFDdriver,what is the time limit?
09-01-2018T23:47:51,TheFDdriver,3 am?
09-01-2018T23:48:57,MadMaxton,btw what is it about that additional stream on Tuesday?
09-01-2018T23:49:17,TheFDdriver,idk
09-01-2018T23:49:44,Ordithus,That was a Nora card.  Tom sometimes does unscheduled streams.
09-01-2018T23:50:04,Bgrmystr2,yeah tom doesn't schedule all his streams
09-01-2018T23:50:14,Bgrmystr2,"and that was monday, not tuesday"
09-01-2018T23:50:42,Ordithus,"The recording posted Tuesday, I think that's what Max was asking about."
09-01-2018T23:51:23,InTheLionsDen,"The posted schedule is more of a guideline, not a rule."
09-01-2018T23:51:26,Bgrmystr2,Yeah the streams usually go into tuesday morning
09-01-2018T23:51:31,Bgrmystr2,from monday night
09-01-2018T23:51:39,Bgrmystr2,"and then are posted on tues morning as ""tuesday"""
09-01-2018T23:51:54,Bgrmystr2,but are simply from the previous night
09-01-2018T23:51:56,Ordithus,Tom likes to work late.
09-01-2018T23:54:27,Bgrmystr2,the stream was from monday night at 9pm
09-01-2018T23:54:40,Bgrmystr2,or so
09-01-2018T23:54:43,Bgrmystr2,maybe 10pm
09-01-2018T23:54:48,Bgrmystr2,don't recall what time he went live
