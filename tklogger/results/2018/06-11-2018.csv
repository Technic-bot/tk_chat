06-11-2018T12:38:54,TerraTheWizard,hehe
06-11-2018T12:39:04,Xexanoth,there can never be enough waggy tails
06-11-2018T12:39:19,Xexanoth,"i did the math, it's scientificly impossible"
06-11-2018T12:44:07,Mippy,Good morning! Sick as a dog but forcing myself to paint.

06-11-2018T12:45:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m officially down with the sickness
06-11-2018T12:46:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Which means two things: I am tired. And I can’t get my flu shot
06-11-2018T12:50:55,Mippy,I don’t bother with the flu shot. There can be shortages up here and I want to save one for someone who actually needs it. Like an older person or someone with a bad immune system
06-11-2018T13:00:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m gonna drink my body weight in orange juice

06-11-2018T13:03:38,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s cold and my throat is dry. Besides it’s considered a good way to help get rid of sinus infections
06-11-2018T13:04:51,SpazztasticKiwi,And I don’t feel like carbonation
06-11-2018T13:05:08,Mippy,I’m on water and tea.
06-11-2018T13:06:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Problem with that is I can’t have tea. It’d go cold and I can’t brew it here
06-11-2018T13:10:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Why did my dumbass convince myself to go ahead and go to work today
06-11-2018T13:10:41,Mippy,Ohhh...we have a Tim’s in the cafeteria. So I have fresh brew on hand. Down side is that I have to pay for it.
06-11-2018T13:11:40,SpazztasticKiwi,$$ = 🍵
06-11-2018T13:12:12,Mippy,"Yup, pretty much. It was worth the $2"
06-11-2018T13:12:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Well that depends. How bigs the cup
06-11-2018T13:13:41,Mippy,20 oz...I don’t know what that is in American
06-11-2018T13:15:27,SpazztasticKiwi,20 oz makes pretty good sense to me
06-11-2018T13:15:58,SpazztasticKiwi,But I gotta go in. At least I’m off at 8. Or ~scheduled~ to be off then anyway
06-11-2018T13:16:59,Mippy,"Yeah, I have a presentation to get too. See you later maybe. See you later too Tom!"
06-11-2018T13:17:54,SpazztasticKiwi,See you later

06-11-2018T15:30:06,TerraTheWizard,sorry
06-11-2018T15:30:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Great. It’s spreading digitally now
06-11-2018T15:30:30,SpazztasticKiwi,As if I wasn’t antisocial enough
06-11-2018T15:31:08,Bgrmystr2,I've had a headache since last night and it won't go away..
06-11-2018T15:31:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I know that feel
06-11-2018T15:31:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I had a headache for like two or three days at one point
06-11-2018T15:31:50,Mippy,Dammit Terra...you got Bgr too
06-11-2018T15:31:54,Bgrmystr2,it feels so late..
06-11-2018T15:31:57,Bgrmystr2,no I'm not sick
06-11-2018T15:32:00,SpazztasticKiwi,One reason I know I was getting sick
06-11-2018T15:32:15,Bgrmystr2,don't confuse headache and sickness
06-11-2018T15:32:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh you wanna know something interesting that happened a few days ago
06-11-2018T15:32:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Our strawberry cooler caught fire
06-11-2018T15:33:04,Mippy,Headache can be the start of sick :shrug:

06-11-2018T15:33:29,Bgrmystr2,nor do I get headaches when I do get sick

06-11-2018T19:20:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Lucky

06-11-2018T19:20:54,unsteddyphoenix,All the more reason to sell them
06-11-2018T19:21:22,ThingsAreMoving,was that sentence a trainwreck?
06-11-2018T19:21:31,SpazztasticKiwi,No
06-11-2018T19:21:32,ThingsAreMoving,I get a vibe of a trinwreck
06-11-2018T19:21:38,SpazztasticKiwi,That one was
06-11-2018T19:21:42,RimaDraws,i love my parents
06-11-2018T19:21:46,RimaDraws,i dont want to sell them
06-11-2018T19:23:44,RimaDraws,you ever look at old art and realize how much you've improved
06-11-2018T19:24:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Yep
06-11-2018T19:24:32,RimaDraws,i just realized how much ive improved in a  year
06-11-2018T19:25:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"If I worked more often, I’d probably be better but 🤷🏻‍♀️"
06-11-2018T19:26:40,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s an on my own time thing since I’m not paid for any of what I do. I generally work on things now and then when I have time
06-11-2018T19:26:49,SpazztasticKiwi,And energy
06-11-2018T19:27:18,ThingsAreMoving,Energy | Money | Time - pick two
06-11-2018T19:32:39,Twokinds,Feels more like pick 1 sometimes in my experience. XD
06-11-2018T19:34:02,ThingsAreMoving,"That's living on hardmode. More XP, but very easy to loose."
06-11-2018T19:34:34,unsteddyphoenix,Challenge mode
06-11-2018T19:35:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"Time = money though, especially with a job"
06-11-2018T19:35:26,unsteddyphoenix,these equations are getting complicated
06-11-2018T19:35:40,SpazztasticKiwi,And with the sacrifice of time you get the money (paycheck) but the work leaves you with no energy
06-11-2018T19:36:07,ThingsAreMoving,Well if work leaves you with no energy I dare say you're not doing it right.
06-11-2018T19:36:29,ThingsAreMoving,or rather you're putting too much effort into it
06-11-2018T19:36:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Though in my experience even when you have all three doing something can become quite boring without someone to share it with
06-11-2018T19:36:57,ThingsAreMoving,Relatable
06-11-2018T19:37:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Another reason East is fun but not a priority if I’m not going with a friend
06-11-2018T19:37:58,ThingsAreMoving,East?
06-11-2018T19:38:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Not to mention I don’t have time to plan the trip at this point I don’t believe
06-11-2018T19:38:04,SpazztasticKiwi,PAX East
06-11-2018T19:38:39,ThingsAreMoving,"Oh, right. That gaming convention in march."
06-11-2018T19:39:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Some animators go too
06-11-2018T19:39:10,SpazztasticKiwi,And there’s a table top section
06-11-2018T19:40:36,ThingsAreMoving,It'd be nice to go to something like that with a group of friends.
06-11-2018T19:41:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Going with my friend last year we met some of the animators and played 5 things
06-11-2018T19:42:27,SpazztasticKiwi,And I shared my funniest picture of Crankgameplays (Ethan) with everyone
06-11-2018T19:42:42,SpazztasticKiwi,But we talked art too
06-11-2018T19:43:53,ThingsAreMoving,Fun times. If I'll ever win a large sum of money I might start going to these events.
06-11-2018T19:44:15,unsteddyphoenix,same
06-11-2018T19:49:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I think it’s safe for me to say I’m not staying up when I get home
06-11-2018T19:49:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Like when I get off work my face and pillow are going to be best friends
06-11-2018T19:52:41,ThingsAreMoving,"I have the same routine, back from work, undress, acquire bathrobe, shower, acquire food, nom while watching some cool recipes on youtube and then do whatever I want for ~3hrs. Usually going to bed around 2am."
06-11-2018T19:53:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I actually went to bed about 1 last night
06-11-2018T19:54:02,SpazztasticKiwi,When I actually fell asleep though was another story
06-11-2018T19:54:52,ThingsAreMoving,"Yeah, tossing and turning without being able to actually fall asleep is the worst."
06-11-2018T19:55:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Nah nose was stuffed
06-11-2018T19:55:41,unsteddyphoenix,Oh yeah. When you go to bed early to try get some sleep
06-11-2018T19:55:52,SpazztasticKiwi,“Try”
06-11-2018T19:55:54,unsteddyphoenix,But then you end up tossing and turning past the point where you'd usually sleep
06-11-2018T19:56:11,unsteddyphoenix,That makes me unreasonably upset
06-11-2018T19:56:18,Bgrmystr2,"well yeah when you go to bed earlier than your body clock is ready to shut down, you don't sleep. Just seems like a bigass ""duh"" to me"
06-11-2018T19:56:19,ThingsAreMoving,I have my trusty vick's vaporub for stuffy nose. Works like a charm.
06-11-2018T19:56:33,unsteddyphoenix,Get that aloe vera action
06-11-2018T19:56:51,ThingsAreMoving,menthol + eucalyptus
06-11-2018T19:57:03,ThingsAreMoving,breathing is FUN again!
06-11-2018T19:57:18,Dadrobit,Back
06-11-2018T19:57:23,Bgrmystr2,"there's no point trying to force sleep when it's not gonna happen, that's why you need a proper schedule and know when sleep is, cuz your body isn't gonna sleep whenever you demand it."
06-11-2018T19:57:37,Dadrobit,Had to pick up grandaddy from the airport.
06-11-2018T19:57:42,ThingsAreMoving,wb dad
06-11-2018T19:57:48,unsteddyphoenix,But. Im really bad at that bgr. :T
06-11-2018T19:57:49,unsteddyphoenix,Ay dad
06-11-2018T19:57:57,ThingsAreMoving,dad's granddad?
06-11-2018T19:58:22,Dadrobit,"Aye, coming out from New York."
