06-09-2018T00:20:41,InTheLionsDen,:hamburger::fries:
06-09-2018T00:22:14,Twokinds,I'd love a burger and fries.
06-09-2018T00:25:45,SpazztasticKiwi,You‚Äôre new name is Hungry
06-09-2018T00:25:51,SpazztasticKiwi,*your
06-09-2018T00:26:41,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre try to subtly get one of us to invest delivery meals
06-09-2018T00:26:51,SpazztasticKiwi,*in
06-09-2018T00:27:32,InTheLionsDen,Delivery by Amazon drone drop.
06-09-2018T00:28:21,Dadrobit,"Went to this little hole in the wall Thai place for dinner before the movie with the grandparents, it was stellar."
06-09-2018T00:28:35,Dadrobit,Had some awesome curry.
06-09-2018T00:29:34,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúHere‚Äôs your food‚Äù *drops box from 5 feet high* ‚ÄúHope you can catch!‚Äù
06-09-2018T00:29:54,Twokinds,"If delivery drones ever become a thing, I can't wait."
06-09-2018T00:30:21,Dadrobit,"""Here's your Birthday cake.... ON THE GROUD!!!!"""
06-09-2018T00:30:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Well there‚Äôs organic delivery drones
06-09-2018T00:30:35,SpazztasticKiwi,People in cars
06-09-2018T00:31:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Gotta tip those tho. And they‚Äôre effected by traffic
06-09-2018T00:31:05,Dadrobit,"I thought you were gonna say ""birds"". Like, just get a slingshot and a BBQ."
06-09-2018T00:31:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"I have no issue with eating meat but I‚Äôd also prefer it from a market. You know, where the people who know what they‚Äôre doing clean and cut it"
06-09-2018T00:32:27,SpazztasticKiwi,ü•©
06-09-2018T00:32:29,Dadrobit,Learned how to do that when I had chickens. Pretty simple tbh.
06-09-2018T00:46:15,SpazztasticKiwi,You know that toe cramp moment when you feel the end is nigh
06-09-2018T00:46:58,TorqueEmUp,Don't like dealing with delivery drivers Tom? :P
06-09-2018T00:47:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Nm cramp gone
06-09-2018T00:47:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel he doesn‚Äôt like the tipping part. Or the people part
06-09-2018T00:47:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Or paying for the meal
06-09-2018T00:48:11,TorqueEmUp,"Oh what a shame, having to pay for your food. XP"
06-09-2018T00:50:00,TorqueEmUp,"I Doordash for a living, and Tips are the only thing that keeps it worth my time to do."
06-09-2018T00:52:57,Twokinds,"No, I love uberEats, Grubhub, etc"
06-09-2018T00:53:05,Twokinds,It's what I wanted years ago.
06-09-2018T00:54:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don‚Äôt like eating out for the simple fact that you can make at home. It‚Äôs just there, there‚Äôs the effort thing"
06-09-2018T00:54:34,Twokinds,"Though delevery fees + tip does make it an expensive indulgence, which is why I don't use it frequently."
06-09-2018T00:55:01,SpazztasticKiwi,We don‚Äôt even have delivery around here
06-09-2018T00:55:11,TorqueEmUp,Oh yeah of course. I've only used it once myself when I was between cars.
06-09-2018T00:55:35,TorqueEmUp,Can be quite pricey
06-09-2018T00:55:44,SpazztasticKiwi,And I‚Äôm not a huge fan of someone showing up to my house
06-09-2018T00:55:57,TorqueEmUp,I've had orders where I was paid more than the meal was worth.
06-09-2018T00:56:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Sure they‚Äôre invited technically and have food but
06-09-2018T00:57:22,SpazztasticKiwi,The drink at Jacks tour show was near expensive rates. Even worse if you chose to spike it
06-09-2018T00:57:25,Twokinds,Just get a basket that you lower down for them to put the food into
06-09-2018T00:57:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd rather tip them through the bill and tell em to leave it at the step
06-09-2018T00:57:58,TorqueEmUp,I think she more doesn't like the fact a random person would be delivering her food.
06-09-2018T00:58:34,TorqueEmUp,"Oh yeah, that's how DoorDash, UberEats usually works, you tip through the app."
06-09-2018T00:59:00,Twokinds,"Just get a ring, tell them over the intercom to leave the food."
06-09-2018T00:59:02,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you a 10 if you just tell knock knock and leave‚Äù
06-09-2018T00:59:08,SpazztasticKiwi,*yell
06-09-2018T01:00:40,TorqueEmUp,"I've had people leave me drop off instructions as just knock/ring bell, and leave on doorstep."
06-09-2018T01:00:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Thera grocery app that does that. ‚ÄúSpecial request‚Äù box - I‚Äôve seen where someone actually just told them to drop it off and leave
06-09-2018T01:01:33,TorqueEmUp,"I've also had people say ""Might be in shower, just leave at door if I don't answer."""
06-09-2018T01:02:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Saw someone snapchat where they instructed the person to just walk in and go to their bedroom.
06-09-2018T01:02:27,TorqueEmUp,"though out of over 1100+ of these that i've done, those kinda deliveries rarely happen."
06-09-2018T01:02:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Got delivery in bed. Still in pajamas
06-09-2018T01:02:39,Twokinds,Oh no that'd be scary
06-09-2018T01:02:40,TorqueEmUp,"Oh fuck that, I wouldn't enter anyone's home"
06-09-2018T01:02:59,Twokinds,"If I was a delivery driver, I'd never want to go in some stranger's house. Seems like a good way to get murdered."
06-09-2018T01:03:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I smell murder
06-09-2018T01:03:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Or naked grandma
06-09-2018T01:03:25,Vatruvius,Agh! :ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:
06-09-2018T01:03:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"Hell, naked anything. Walking into a rando house is a nope"
06-09-2018T01:03:56,Vatruvius,"Well, that was my representation of my irritation but that also goes well with your comment Kiwi."
06-09-2018T01:04:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Timing:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
06-09-2018T01:05:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom if you ever ‚Äúbecome‚Äù a delivery driver, I‚Äôll know you‚Äôve been kidnapped"
06-09-2018T01:05:43,TorqueEmUp,"Probably the most weird delivery i've done was someone who was under the influence of something strong. I walk up, deralict car in the driveway with flat tires and 3 year old temp tags, and a broken motorcycle, front window next to the front door smashed"
06-09-2018T01:05:49,TorqueEmUp,outward.
06-09-2018T01:06:02,TorqueEmUp,glass on the sidewalk
06-09-2018T01:06:12,Vatruvius,"Yeah, you knock on someone's door and they recognize...suddenly you see the shrine to you in the hallway..."
06-09-2018T01:06:42,Vatruvius,recognize you*
06-09-2018T01:06:44,TorqueEmUp,"Knock on the door, wait... nobody, knock again... Here a slam, and I see a guy start slowly stumbling out from the back room"
06-09-2018T01:07:08,TorqueEmUp,falls against the wall and down onto the floor
06-09-2018T01:07:22,Vatruvius,Sort of glad I do not deliver anything.
06-09-2018T01:07:31,TorqueEmUp,"he then slowly got up, and finally made his way to the door."
06-09-2018T01:08:10,TorqueEmUp,"and I asked, ""Are you allright?"" He literally just mumbled complete nonsense, so I just handed him his Taco Bell and I got out of there."
06-09-2018T01:08:29,Vatruvius,"So Tom, I am sure I am not first to the boat about getting stuck with my comic's story and getting really frustrated trying to figure what is missing."
06-09-2018T01:08:47,Twokinds,"Oh man, you get taco bell deliveries there? Jealous..."
06-09-2018T01:08:56,TorqueEmUp,DoorDash does it
06-09-2018T01:09:05,Twokinds,No mexican food where I am.
06-09-2018T01:09:05,Vatruvius,I did not know Taco Bell did delievers...?
06-09-2018T01:09:12,Vatruvius,deliveries*
06-09-2018T01:09:14,TorqueEmUp,Through DoorDash
06-09-2018T01:09:34,Vatruvius,Ahh...
06-09-2018T01:09:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Taco Bell isn‚Äôt Mexican - what are you on?
06-09-2018T01:09:40,Vatruvius,My cousin does DoorDash.
06-09-2018T01:09:46,Vatruvius,Said he got paid pretty well for it.
06-09-2018T01:09:55,TorqueEmUp,It's decent
06-09-2018T01:10:02,TorqueEmUp,But it is a lot of wear and tear on a car.
06-09-2018T01:10:09,Vatruvius,Yeah.
06-09-2018T01:10:13,Twokinds,"Huh, strange, doordash wasn't available in my area  before"
06-09-2018T01:10:18,Twokinds,But it seems like it might be now...
06-09-2018T01:10:43,Vatruvius,"Well, sounds like Tom will be eating more Taco Bell during streams."
06-09-2018T01:10:44,Twokinds,"And yes, Vat"
06-09-2018T01:10:51,TorqueEmUp,"Yup, I actually had to go to an orientation down towards Cincinatti before I could start doing it."
06-09-2018T01:11:02,Twokinds,Getting stuck is always an issue
06-09-2018T01:11:10,TorqueEmUp,and of course right after that they opened up an office up here in Dayton. :P
06-09-2018T01:11:15,Vatruvius,I am so frustrated right now a mini me in my head is scratching the inside of my skull.
06-09-2018T01:11:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Look at Flora - she‚Äôs the definition of being stuck
06-09-2018T01:11:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Pregnant
06-09-2018T01:11:28,SpazztasticKiwi,For years
06-09-2018T01:11:38,Vatruvius,"If he had objects to through, they would have already been thrown."
06-09-2018T01:11:41,Vatruvius,throw*
06-09-2018T01:11:43,Vatruvius,derp
06-09-2018T01:11:52,SpazztasticKiwi,:ctwokinds-reniderp: derp
06-09-2018T01:11:52,TorqueEmUp,"I started doing this back in April, I don't know how long it was going before that around here."
06-09-2018T01:12:47,Twokinds,:O Chipotle
06-09-2018T01:12:55,Twokinds,And Korean food
06-09-2018T01:12:57,Vatruvius,"I do not know if we have DoorDash where I live, not that I would use it, but I am my families DoorDash."
06-09-2018T01:12:57,Twokinds,This is bad
06-09-2018T01:13:03,Vatruvius,DX
06-09-2018T01:13:22,unsteddyphoenix,Oh no it's TOO CONVENIENT
06-09-2018T01:13:24,Vatruvius,Bad because now you have access to all the foods?
06-09-2018T01:13:25,TorqueEmUp,"Oh yeah, I do lots of those Chipotle orders, so they must be a much cheaper options."
06-09-2018T01:13:27,Vatruvius,lol
06-09-2018T01:13:45,Twokinds,Oh the Korean is so expensive
06-09-2018T01:13:55,Vatruvius,Darn.
06-09-2018T01:14:08,unsteddyphoenix,Discrimination :/
06-09-2018T01:14:17,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, delivery fees vary quite a bit depending on the place."
06-09-2018T01:14:47,Twokinds,"Nah just the menu itself. Not... VERY expensive, but still a lot more than I like to spend."
06-09-2018T01:15:18,Vatruvius,A treat your self menu then?
06-09-2018T01:15:20,unsteddyphoenix,But that kbbq tho
06-09-2018T01:15:31,unsteddyphoenix,Worth it~
06-09-2018T01:15:46,Vatruvius,Not if you go hungry unsteddy.
06-09-2018T01:16:54,unsteddyphoenix,I think buying food solves that problem generally
06-09-2018T01:16:57,TorqueEmUp,"Probably the 4 restaurants I pick up order the most from are Chipotle, Buffalo Wild Wings, BJ's, and Red Robin."
06-09-2018T01:17:14,TorqueEmUp,pick up the most orders from*
06-09-2018T01:17:17,Vatruvius,Not a single one of those is near where I live.
06-09-2018T01:17:18,Twokinds,Really?: Hm
06-09-2018T01:17:39,Twokinds,Yeah Chipotle and BWW are two favs of mine
06-09-2018T01:17:48,Twokinds,Also Goldstar Chili
06-09-2018T01:17:51,Vatruvius,"Not that I am complaining, I typically eat homemade food."
06-09-2018T01:17:55,TorqueEmUp,"The two rarest places is McDonalds, Starbucks"
06-09-2018T01:18:10,TorqueEmUp,I've had like 4 McDonalds order ever. lol
06-09-2018T01:18:18,Vatruvius,What?! People are so lazy the DoorDash McDonalds.
06-09-2018T01:18:23,TorqueEmUp,out of the 1100+ i've done. lol
06-09-2018T01:18:32,Vatruvius,they*
06-09-2018T01:18:38,Twokinds,I feel like that makes sense. If you're gunna get Mcd you'd probably just get it yourself.
06-09-2018T01:18:43,TorqueEmUp,Though one of those was for a girl who was blind actually.
06-09-2018T01:18:48,Twokinds,"But if you're going to get it delivered, you might as well go with something else."
06-09-2018T01:18:52,Vatruvius,That would make sense.
06-09-2018T01:19:09,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah noone really PLANS to get McDonald's
06-09-2018T01:19:18,unsteddyphoenix,It's just there sometimes
06-09-2018T01:19:27,TorqueEmUp,Yeah no kidding. lol
06-09-2018T01:19:29,Twokinds,Exactly
06-09-2018T01:19:48,Vatruvius,It has been around about 8 years since I last ate fast food.
06-09-2018T01:20:14,Vatruvius,And before that 3 years.
06-09-2018T01:20:17,Twokinds,I'm not going to pay extra for the privilage of eating McDonalds
06-09-2018T01:20:29,Vatruvius,lol
06-09-2018T01:20:47,unsteddyphoenix,Anyone who did I'd consider very odd
06-09-2018T01:20:58,TorqueEmUp,Whenever i've worked lunch hours lots of people stuck at work will use delivery services.
06-09-2018T01:22:06,Vatruvius,That makes sense though.
06-09-2018T01:22:18,TorqueEmUp,I had one where I literally ran some BWW across the parking lot to a Best Buy. lol
06-09-2018T01:22:31,Vatruvius,:ctwokinds-RaineEep:
06-09-2018T01:23:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôve never had Chipotle, BWW, BJs, or Red Robin‚Äôs"
06-09-2018T01:23:12,unsteddyphoenix,That's so decadent
06-09-2018T01:23:16,SpazztasticKiwi,None around here
06-09-2018T01:23:25,unsteddyphoenix,Hey same!
06-09-2018T01:23:57,TorqueEmUp,Mostly the same for me too actually
06-09-2018T01:24:21,SpazztasticKiwi,And what‚Äôs Goldstar Chili
06-09-2018T01:24:26,Vatruvius,Most of the restaurants around here are local businesses or very small chains. I think my favorite is the Thai place. We have two and both are very good.
06-09-2018T01:24:35,TorqueEmUp,We don't really have one of those here.
06-09-2018T01:24:44,TorqueEmUp,But we do have Skyline Chile
06-09-2018T01:25:01,Twokinds,Those are pretty much the same
06-09-2018T01:25:05,Twokinds,Though I do prefer Goldstar
06-09-2018T01:25:55,Vatruvius,I like gold stars too Tom. :ctwokinds-wink:
06-09-2018T01:26:16,SpazztasticKiwi,What‚Äôs Skyline?!
06-09-2018T01:26:42,Twokinds,"It's basically spaghetti with chili, and then toped with a boatload of cheese."
06-09-2018T01:26:48,Twokinds,A cincinnati staple.

06-09-2018T01:27:04,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds weird im in
06-09-2018T01:27:04,Vatruvius,Umm...that sounds like a heart attack on a plate.

06-09-2018T01:27:35,TorqueEmUp,"Nothing wrong with it, it's usually a default if there is nothing else around."
06-09-2018T01:27:42,TorqueEmUp,nice and cheap
06-09-2018T01:27:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I know the McDonald‚Äôs I visit and I know what to avoid. I order based on that
06-09-2018T01:27:43,unsteddyphoenix,I'd just never have it DELIVERED
06-09-2018T01:27:45,Vatruvius,McDonalds is considered the lowest quality food in the US pretty much.

06-09-2018T01:28:14,Twokinds,This is what it looks like.
06-09-2018T01:28:26,TorqueEmUp,But Skyline Chili is a pretty local brand now that I've looked.
06-09-2018T01:28:30,TorqueEmUp,"""As of February 2018, Skyline Chili operates 134 restaurants in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and Florida."""
06-09-2018T01:28:31,SpazztasticKiwi,That just makes me slightly uncomfortable
06-09-2018T01:28:33,Bgrmystr2,Vatru isn't lying on that one lol
06-09-2018T01:28:35,Twokinds,"That cheese is not an exaggeration. It's often more, in fact."
06-09-2018T01:28:54,Bgrmystr2,to be fair that looks like an ordinary hotdog to me
06-09-2018T01:28:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean spaghetti noodles n chili...?
06-09-2018T01:29:04,unsteddyphoenix,Oh my god lol

06-09-2018T01:29:20,unsteddyphoenix,Its the gross american yellow cheese too

06-09-2018T01:29:35,unsteddyphoenix,'course you do
06-09-2018T01:30:17,Twokinds,It's not American cheese. I think it's sharp cheddar.

06-09-2018T01:30:22,Vatruvius,"Mr. Jalapeno Pizza over here likes to drown his Chili Spaghetti in RedHot, could not have guessed that."

06-09-2018T01:31:44,Vatruvius,"Friend is calling me, be back later."
06-09-2018T01:31:44,TorqueEmUp,"like a 5 min drive, where everything else is like a 10-15min drive."
06-09-2018T01:32:07,Dadrobit,Their Signature Crafted menu items are actually deicious. Not even ashamed.
06-09-2018T01:32:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Muenster cheese is what I like. And Colby/Colby Jack or provolone
06-09-2018T01:32:23,TorqueEmUp,If they would keep the stuff I actually like!
06-09-2018T01:32:32,unsteddyphoenix,If I wanted expensive burgers i'd go...anywhere else though.
06-09-2018T01:32:37,TorqueEmUp,The Jalepeno McDoubles were awesome!
06-09-2018T01:32:42,TorqueEmUp,Then they got rid of hem
06-09-2018T01:32:44,TorqueEmUp,them*
06-09-2018T01:32:53,Twokinds,"Huh, I never heard of those"
06-09-2018T01:33:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Signature crafted is a bit bs to me. Good but stupidly overpriced
06-09-2018T01:33:07,Twokinds,I'd have definitely tried it. Though I do just prefer the regular mcdoubles.
06-09-2018T01:33:07,TorqueEmUp,"Then the Swiss Mushroom Melt, they got rid of that too."
06-09-2018T01:33:40,TorqueEmUp,"Honestly Spazz they weren't but like maybe $1 more than say a Big Mac, or Quarter Pounder meal."
06-09-2018T01:33:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not an onion fan but I‚Äôll have a grilled mushroom burger
06-09-2018T01:33:54,Twokinds,Especially back when you could get two for a dollar. That was great.
06-09-2018T01:34:03,Twokinds,"I would order like, 10 of them."
06-09-2018T01:34:09,TorqueEmUp,yeah now Mcdoubles are $1.59
06-09-2018T01:34:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt get BM or QP meals but very rarely
06-09-2018T01:34:34,TorqueEmUp,"McChickens are still $1, but those are kinda crap."
06-09-2018T01:34:51,Twokinds,1.55?! Aw ripoff
06-09-2018T01:34:58,SpazztasticKiwi,One of the avoid things. Unless I have time for it to be made fresh
06-09-2018T01:35:06,Dadrobit,"Yeah, SC burers are around 5 bucks, which isn't terrible honestly. Still cheaper than a proper Bar and Grill Burger."
06-09-2018T01:35:11,Dadrobit,burgers*
06-09-2018T01:35:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Ours is $6 or more
06-09-2018T01:36:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Mcdouble is $1.79 if I remember
06-09-2018T01:36:27,TorqueEmUp,depends on where you live probably
06-09-2018T01:36:33,Dadrobit,"I mean, a decent sit down burger elsewhere starts at 9 barebones around here."
06-09-2018T01:36:44,Dadrobit,12-14 if you want the good shit.
06-09-2018T01:36:49,TorqueEmUp,"But here in Ohio, they are $1.59"
06-09-2018T01:36:58,unsteddyphoenix,So cheap :ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:
06-09-2018T01:37:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"Or $1.59, idk. I know how to sneak the menu for cheaper"
06-09-2018T01:37:32,TorqueEmUp,That's just what I remember when I ordered one yesterday
06-09-2018T01:37:57,TorqueEmUp,"because I was really on a budget food wise, and had nothing but cereal in the apartment."
06-09-2018T01:38:24,Dadrobit,The dollar menu spicy chicken sandwiches are my go-to when I'm passing by and just looking for something immediate.
06-09-2018T01:38:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, just a note - if you order a burger/drink or drink/fries, just get the meal. It‚Äôs cheaper for 99% of the combos"
06-09-2018T01:39:02,Twokinds,"It'd be a waste for me, I never get a drink"
06-09-2018T01:39:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Would you rather pay more?
06-09-2018T01:39:25,TorqueEmUp,Yeah I need to stop getting drinks. i'd save so much if I did. lol
06-09-2018T01:39:37,TorqueEmUp,I always get a large unsweet tea
06-09-2018T01:39:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Give it to your mom or something
06-09-2018T01:39:48,Twokinds,Eh
06-09-2018T01:39:53,TorqueEmUp,which they recently just upped the price of from $1 to $1.15
06-09-2018T01:40:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"Granted, maybe the other way is cheaper in other places, but I‚Äôve found this way is"
06-09-2018T01:40:17,Twokinds,Darn inflation!
06-09-2018T01:40:26,TorqueEmUp,"yep, darn that inflation!"
06-09-2018T01:40:37,TorqueEmUp,"But what doesn't make sense, they didn't do it for soda"
06-09-2018T01:40:49,TorqueEmUp,So a large soda with tax is $1.09
06-09-2018T01:40:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"And if you want something fresh, or like me, am watching your salt/fat/whatever intake, ask for low or no salt patty or fries. They‚Äôll cook it"
06-09-2018T01:41:01,unsteddyphoenix,This ECONOMY
06-09-2018T01:41:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"But with no salt fries, there‚Äôs no adding salt after. It won‚Äôt stick"
06-09-2018T01:42:00,Bgrmystr2,"lol to be honest, the sweet tea from mcdonalds and their fries are the only thing I ever legit liked from their menu"
06-09-2018T01:42:01,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, I really need to reduce my sodium intake more than anything."
06-09-2018T01:42:34,SpazztasticKiwi,The sweet tea is a thing I avoid. I know how it‚Äôs made and what‚Äôs in it
06-09-2018T01:43:18,Bgrmystr2,it's tea with sugar lol
06-09-2018T01:43:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll just say the liquid sugar reminds me of implants
06-09-2018T01:43:23,Dadrobit,Was never a big fan of McD fries. Burger King is better tbh.
06-09-2018T01:43:26,TorqueEmUp,"Especially McDonalds, most of that is friggin' sugar."
06-09-2018T01:43:31,Dadrobit,Arbys on top tho
06-09-2018T01:43:43,TorqueEmUp,Arbys be pricey though
06-09-2018T01:43:46,Bgrmystr2,"I've had fries from BK, but the places I went to all had trash fries so"
06-09-2018T01:43:48,Bgrmystr2,I dunno
06-09-2018T01:43:56,TorqueEmUp,I miss their 5 for $5 Roastbeef sandwhiches
06-09-2018T01:43:56,Bgrmystr2,maybe they're better where you are
06-09-2018T01:44:22,SpazztasticKiwi,My tops are Wendy‚Äôs and Arby‚Äôs
06-09-2018T01:44:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Neither are even remotely local
06-09-2018T01:44:38,Dadrobit,5 for 5 is still a thing around here.
06-09-2018T01:45:04,SpazztasticKiwi,And captain d‚Äôs. I like fish and seafood
06-09-2018T01:45:17,TorqueEmUp,Wendy's is pretty damn good. They are actually the most popular of the fast food chains for DoorDash users.
06-09-2018T01:45:30,Dadrobit,We have an Arbys here with this suuuuuuper old lady who runs the till. Amazingly sweet though.
06-09-2018T01:45:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"I should not, but I do, get the baconator fries"
06-09-2018T01:46:04,SpazztasticKiwi,And loaded potato
06-09-2018T01:46:10,SpazztasticKiwi,And I‚Äôm happy
06-09-2018T01:46:13,Dadrobit,"She came in to my store on my birthday to give me a freshly baked bannanna bread loaf a few years back, almost teared up."
06-09-2018T01:46:18,TorqueEmUp,I always get the Asiago Ranch Chicken Club or whatever it's called.
06-09-2018T01:46:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Awwwwwwwwe üëµ
06-09-2018T01:46:45,unsteddyphoenix,What a sweetheart
06-09-2018T01:46:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Arby‚Äôs has those $1 time things. Sliders are üëåüèª
06-09-2018T01:47:14,TorqueEmUp,But Wendy's is pretty pricey too. a Large Asiago Combo is $9
06-09-2018T01:47:16,Dadrobit,"I had mentioned my father used to bake them when I was a kid like, 7 months prior to it, so she asked my manager for my birthday and put it down on her calander."
06-09-2018T01:47:28,Dadrobit,I should go to Arbys tomorrow and say hi.
06-09-2018T01:47:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you‚Äôre hungry, at this point chat is just torture"
06-09-2018T01:47:43,TorqueEmUp,lol
06-09-2018T01:48:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Go say hi to your adopted grandma
06-09-2018T01:48:16,Dadrobit,lol
06-09-2018T01:48:36,Dadrobit,My grandma would have ~words~ for me
06-09-2018T01:49:44,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, I don't think so Kiwi"
06-09-2018T01:49:48,SpazztasticKiwi,You can have more than two grandmas
06-09-2018T01:49:54,Bgrmystr2,I'd presume most ppl have self control :P
06-09-2018T01:49:56,Bgrmystr2,but yknow
06-09-2018T01:49:59,unsteddyphoenix,Oh I just saw the new pic with the mean girls. Big fan~

06-09-2018T01:50:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Good booty and boob in one picture

06-09-2018T01:51:28,TorqueEmUp,The one thing I CAN cook. lol
06-09-2018T01:51:37,Bgrmystr2,lol thas it? :P
06-09-2018T01:51:39,Dadrobit,Aesthetic
06-09-2018T01:52:07,TorqueEmUp,Well other types of eggs. I can do some baking. But Breakfast stuff is the quickest and easiest to clean up.
06-09-2018T01:52:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Google ‚Äúnostalgia retro three in one breakfast station‚Äù
06-09-2018T01:52:37,Dadrobit,I want it
06-09-2018T01:52:56,TorqueEmUp,My parent's spoiled me when I was still living at home. X_X
06-09-2018T01:53:03,SpazztasticKiwi,A thing of beauty isn‚Äôt it
06-09-2018T01:53:06,TorqueEmUp,With their cooking
06-09-2018T01:53:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Perfect for small space
06-09-2018T01:53:26,Bgrmystr2,I make all the food I eat
06-09-2018T01:53:47,Bgrmystr2,"minus every once in a while when someone offers to make me somethin, but"
06-09-2018T01:53:54,unsteddyphoenix,lol this thing looks like one of those fake kitchen toys kids have
06-09-2018T01:54:01,Bgrmystr2,yknow
06-09-2018T01:54:22,TorqueEmUp,Well la de da bgr.
06-09-2018T01:54:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"For like $60, it better not be plastic"
06-09-2018T01:54:41,Bgrmystr2,"you should prolly get on it, Torque :P"
06-09-2018T01:54:46,Bgrmystr2,"lol, kiwi, what is this"
06-09-2018T01:55:02,Dadrobit,"I have a well established kitchen, so it'd just be for the novelty of it tbh."
06-09-2018T01:55:03,TorqueEmUp,"In all fairness, it's a lot cheaper to do that."
06-09-2018T01:55:39,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs the result of American laziness and innovation
06-09-2018T01:56:00,Bgrmystr2,"to be honest, that actually looks like somethin a lot of ppl I know would want"
06-09-2018T01:56:04,Bgrmystr2,because of convenience
06-09-2018T01:56:34,unsteddyphoenix,I feel like it'd end up as clutter though
06-09-2018T01:57:15,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I dunno if I'd use it.. cuz I'd only need the toaster oven, since I prefer gas stoves"
06-09-2018T01:57:32,unsteddyphoenix,toaster ovens are great admittedly
06-09-2018T01:58:02,Bgrmystr2,I've not used an ordinary toaster more than I have fingers
06-09-2018T01:58:05,Bgrmystr2,cuz toaster oven.
06-09-2018T01:59:44,Dadrobit,"Yeah, that's more innovation than laziness I think. Just trying to be economical about space, like for folks that live in a one room studio."
06-09-2018T02:00:12,Bgrmystr2,yeh gonna agree w/ that
06-09-2018T02:00:28,Dadrobit,laziness is a microwave

06-09-2018T02:36:52,unsteddyphoenix,"Wow no, I dont!"
06-09-2018T02:36:52,Dadrobit,"Dude's back, and now he tirading against Zen."
06-09-2018T02:36:55,unsteddyphoenix,Did I know about this?
06-09-2018T02:36:59,unsteddyphoenix,Yo link me
06-09-2018T02:37:27,Dadrobit,"1 sec, fighting"
06-09-2018T02:39:12,Bgrmystr2,throw me link too
06-09-2018T02:44:50,Dadrobit,"He's not quite to the ""I want to wrap my hands around kei's throat, and choke the life out..."" but I'm sure he'll get there again soon if we give him enough time. https://www.twokinds.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=913555#p913555"
06-09-2018T02:45:41,Dadrobit,"Though, it's not just him this time, probably 1/4 - 1/3 of the forums is on the ""Fuck Zen"" train."
06-09-2018T02:46:14,unsteddyphoenix,Tbh Zens reactions have been kinda unpleasent the last few pages
06-09-2018T02:46:34,unsteddyphoenix,"Im not at the ""zuck fen"" stage yet, but I can understand this reaction kinda"
06-09-2018T02:46:53,Dadrobit,"Was just noting him in particular since his levels of toxicity extended to turning me personally into ""one of [his] hobbies."""
06-09-2018T02:51:10,unsteddyphoenix,oo did you get named?
06-09-2018T02:51:16,unsteddyphoenix,or not YET
06-09-2018T02:51:25,CrimsonQuill,"Aaaaand as usual, all the chat happens while I'm sleep."
06-09-2018T02:51:27,Dadrobit,Lemme see if I can't find the post.
06-09-2018T02:51:28,CrimsonQuill,Hullo
06-09-2018T02:51:36,unsteddyphoenix,o/
06-09-2018T02:51:38,Dadrobit,o/
06-09-2018T02:51:41,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah it feels to me like zen's a bit too worried about Natani rather than being happy that Natani's opening up.. I can understand his view bout the mental link, and how they block things but acceptance of blocked things should be much more important imo"
06-09-2018T02:52:13,Bgrmystr2,but yeh that post on the forum is a bit much
06-09-2018T02:52:43,Dadrobit,https://www.twokinds.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=865752#p865752
06-09-2018T02:52:45,CrimsonQuill,Both characters need to learn a bit...Zen needs to learn to give a little privacy to certain aspects of Nat's life.
06-09-2018T02:53:41,Bgrmystr2,Yeah Zen and Natani have done everything together for their whole lives since the mind link incident
06-09-2018T02:54:11,unsteddyphoenix,Exact same name and icon...did he get unbanned for some reason?
06-09-2018T02:54:17,CrimsonQuill,Now it's time for them to learn to diverge...
06-09-2018T02:54:19,Bgrmystr2,"so the separation and then natani being so different is something he's never seen before, so his reaction is understandable"
06-09-2018T02:54:34,Bgrmystr2,he prolly needs to think on it
06-09-2018T02:54:46,CrimsonQuill,Oooooh yes.
06-09-2018T02:54:57,CrimsonQuill,What time is it for you?
06-09-2018T02:55:06,unsteddyphoenix,"Still though, considering how close theyre forced to be, it's weird how selfishly he reacted"
06-09-2018T02:55:18,unsteddyphoenix,Even if it was just an impulse reaction
06-09-2018T02:55:28,Bgrmystr2,"to be sure yeah, phoenix"
06-09-2018T02:56:24,Bgrmystr2,but I guess that's part of it.. they were so close that something he was so used to just dropped out of nowhere like.. maybe something is wrong? He doesn't know
06-09-2018T02:56:57,unsteddyphoenix,I guess it's pretty established that there's some aspects of Natani he willfully ignored
06-09-2018T02:57:04,unsteddyphoenix,"Namely...anything ""girly"""
06-09-2018T02:57:07,CrimsonQuill,"Well, he's been cut off the link for a little while..."
06-09-2018T02:57:19,Bgrmystr2,"The separation itself was an experience for Natani, for sure, but Zen didn't experience anything but the loss of connection with Natani, and then meeting back up with someone completely different."
06-09-2018T02:57:20,unsteddyphoenix,I guess we can blame the literal wolf-patriarchy
06-09-2018T02:57:31,Dadrobit,"Yeah, he only got a three week ban for the threat."
06-09-2018T02:57:35,CrimsonQuill,I'm off...I have some things to do. Cheerio. :ptv-greetings:
06-09-2018T02:57:43,Bgrmystr2,seeya quill
06-09-2018T02:57:49,unsteddyphoenix,Ugh bans are too light these days
06-09-2018T02:58:46,Dadrobit,"Also, I mean, why wouldn't he look against anything ""girly"" in relation to Natani. That's exactly what Natani does right up to the mind break."
06-09-2018T02:59:56,Bgrmystr2,"yeah Zen's mental image of Natani is still the ""I'm a dudebro"" and Natani NOT being that person when they relink has him completely out of sorts."
06-09-2018T03:00:18,unsteddyphoenix,"Ehh slightly debatable. 'Sides considering that Natani physically ignore some things, you'd think he'd at least try to be supportive instead of lowkey shaming those things."
06-09-2018T03:00:31,unsteddyphoenix,physically cant*
06-09-2018T03:00:50,unsteddyphoenix,"""lol you're in heat? That's gay bro"" -Zen maybe"
06-09-2018T03:00:55,Bgrmystr2,haha
06-09-2018T03:01:12,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, that'd prolly be sibling teasing anyway"
06-09-2018T03:01:47,Dadrobit,"Up to the shackle, shaming womanly things is exactly what Natani did though. I think this is less a showing of Zen's bias, and more a showing of how shocked he is at the sudden 180 from Natani."
06-09-2018T03:02:13,Dadrobit,"I mean, sure, there's definitely some bias, but I think its mostly just the shock."
06-09-2018T03:02:28,Dadrobit,More than people are giving him credit for at least.
06-09-2018T03:02:29,unsteddyphoenix,"I mean he literally says ""I dont want you to do this because I would feel it"""
06-09-2018T03:02:51,Dadrobit,relateable tbh
06-09-2018T03:03:27,Bgrmystr2,"the one thing that bothers me really is zen's go-to is ""What happens if I happen to see it"" While a totally expected reaction, it doesn't put a really good light on him."
06-09-2018T03:03:47,unsteddyphoenix,"Sure, but...that's the first thing you think about? Cmon man~"
06-09-2018T03:03:48,Bgrmystr2,cuz that's him worried about.. him. rather than natani
06-09-2018T03:04:15,unsteddyphoenix,At least try to be SLIGHTLY empathetic
06-09-2018T03:04:39,Dadrobit,No. No empathy. 100% Sociopath.
06-09-2018T03:04:46,Bgrmystr2,hahaha
06-09-2018T03:04:52,unsteddyphoenix,Zen confirmed true villian
06-09-2018T03:05:00,Dadrobit,How else do you think he grew up to be a murderer for hire.
06-09-2018T03:05:11,Bgrmystr2,I think this is gonna be a realy good growing arc for Zen and Natani
06-09-2018T03:05:19,Bgrmystr2,really* even
06-09-2018T03:05:53,unsteddyphoenix,Remember when Trace and Flora were going to get more developed?
06-09-2018T03:06:01,unsteddyphoenix,Wonder where that went~
06-09-2018T03:06:32,Dadrobit,Into Natani's badages.
06-09-2018T03:06:42,Bgrmystr2,didn't that happen on the ship lol
06-09-2018T03:07:36,unsteddyphoenix,You mean that time where Flora summoned a kinda-ghost of traces past lover and they both went through all that drama?
06-09-2018T03:07:42,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah you right~
06-09-2018T03:08:23,Bgrmystr2,lol I was referencing when trace offered flora as subject for Eric's art without asking her
06-09-2018T03:08:34,Dadrobit,wew that took me a second to understand there. Solid meme
06-09-2018T03:09:15,unsteddyphoenix,That DID happen...8 years ago or whatever?
06-09-2018T03:09:23,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe a little more would be cool~
06-09-2018T03:09:31,Dadrobit,Learning to Not using your significant other as a bartering good is such a good start!
06-09-2018T03:09:51,Bgrmystr2,Wasn't that when the development was gonna happen anyway? lol
06-09-2018T03:10:14,unsteddyphoenix,Not even I remember things Tom said THAT long ago
06-09-2018T03:10:28,unsteddyphoenix,It was more recent than that
06-09-2018T03:10:48,Bgrmystr2,hm? Well okay. I'll take your word for it cuz I don't even recall
06-09-2018T03:15:00,Dadrobit,"I feel like it there was mention of growth for them, but that may have just been the whole Adria's bar scene?"
06-09-2018T03:15:47,unsteddyphoenix,"Maybe, actually. Kei did stir the pot for them a bit"
06-09-2018T03:16:33,unsteddyphoenix,"WritingTip: accidentally make your characters relationship too happy? Bring in jealous chad exbf"""

06-09-2018T12:09:17,TorqueEmUp,It's hard to get me motivated to play a game. lol
06-09-2018T12:17:52,Xexanoth,i have the opposite problem...i'm way to motivated to play games.

06-09-2018T16:32:06,CrimsonQuill,I might as well head off then.
06-09-2018T16:32:16,Bgrmystr2,"Also, it's nice of picarto to ""an error has occured"" spam since I went to sleep till now"
06-09-2018T16:32:22,Bgrmystr2,instead of bothering to reconnect
06-09-2018T16:32:35,CrimsonQuill,What's the chance that chat will explode while I'm sleeping?
06-09-2018T16:32:44,CrimsonQuill,Considerin it's 10:30 here.
06-09-2018T16:33:02,Bgrmystr2,"in my experience, obscenely high, and there's not really a stream when I sleep."

06-09-2018T16:33:22,CrimsonQuill,What time is it for you?
06-09-2018T16:33:26,Bgrmystr2,"in 3 1/2 hours, there's a stream"
06-09-2018T16:33:34,Bgrmystr2,4:34pm
06-09-2018T16:33:46,CrimsonQuill,There's a stream tonight.
06-09-2018T16:33:48,Bgrmystr2,"and at 8pm for me is 9pm eastern, which is the scheduled friday stream"
06-09-2018T16:34:06,CrimsonQuill,What's the stream for? Sketches?
06-09-2018T16:34:14,Bgrmystr2,it's just a stream
06-09-2018T16:34:23,Bgrmystr2,the sketch stream for patreon is on sunday
06-09-2018T16:34:44,Bgrmystr2,he just draws whatever he needs to work on at the time
06-09-2018T16:34:50,CrimsonQuill,I'm just still holding out hope that I'll get my Spartan Raine in.
06-09-2018T16:35:02,CrimsonQuill,That's why I've been staying up obsenely late all week.
06-09-2018T16:35:08,CrimsonQuill,obscenley
06-09-2018T16:35:11,CrimsonQuill,obsenely
06-09-2018T16:35:16,CrimsonQuill,Obscenely
06-09-2018T16:35:30,Bgrmystr2,well it's not like staying up late is gonna make a difference
06-09-2018T16:35:34,CrimsonQuill,I keep making simple spelling mistakes. I should know that.
06-09-2018T16:35:44,Bgrmystr2,cuz he doesn't do the sketch streams still sunday
06-09-2018T16:35:59,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I'm a worrying type."
06-09-2018T16:36:22,Bgrmystr2,"well you can stop, cuz we have a schedule. :P it's sitting at the top of the chat like it has been for many years now"
06-09-2018T16:36:43,CrimsonQuill,I'm the sort who's worried about college exams that are two years away.
06-09-2018T16:36:50,CrimsonQuill,I know I have to stop.
06-09-2018T16:37:03,CrimsonQuill,It's unfortunately a very strong habit of mine...
06-09-2018T16:37:29,CrimsonQuill,It also means I have dangerously high levels of procrastination.
06-09-2018T16:37:52,Bgrmystr2,the problem is.. an exam is something that will eventually happen. a suggestion is not the same.
06-09-2018T16:38:21,CrimsonQuill,I've been thinking of starting a comic for years..before I ever found Twokinds.
06-09-2018T16:38:32,CrimsonQuill,But I use a fear of failure as an excuse to put it off.
06-09-2018T16:38:53,CrimsonQuill,I look at myself and see a lot of room for improvement.
06-09-2018T16:39:32,CrimsonQuill,"As for the suggestion..In Terry Pratchett's book, 'Going Postal', a character says that Hope is the greatest gift one can have."
06-09-2018T16:39:52,CrimsonQuill,"Because while it is unlikely for somethiong to happen, there is the lurking sense that it might."
06-09-2018T16:40:15,CrimsonQuill,So I'm sticking to my Halo crossover for now.
06-09-2018T16:53:56,CrimsonQuill,"I'm going to bed. Goodnight,"
06-09-2018T16:55:42,CrimsonQuill,Sleep well everyone

06-09-2018T19:47:42,autoenigma,i felt the same from 3 70 hours weeks back to back
06-09-2018T19:48:01,Combak,Could allergies or medications have something to do with it?
06-09-2018T19:48:09,Combak,Or a lack of sleep recently?
06-09-2018T19:48:22,Combak,"Also, hi all."

06-09-2018T20:17:46,Watsup,Patreon does not use conventional rules for adult content that other sites do

06-09-2018T20:19:56,Watsup,I just make everything private posts and public post them to my other sites and put a notive on the patreon saying why
06-09-2018T20:19:56,Nekonny,which sucks for me because all my stuff is public
06-09-2018T20:20:10,SageSaga,none of my pictures shows nudity or anything close to a lewd act

06-09-2018T20:28:18,ZahnHolley,Hi guys
06-09-2018T20:28:23,Combak,Hi Zahn.
06-09-2018T20:28:25,Ordithus,"In a way, she does.  Just made of cake."

06-09-2018T20:28:32,FoxxTrotter,"Hey, Zahn."
06-09-2018T20:28:38,Watsup,"maybe, that's not how they see it though"
06-09-2018T20:28:39,Combak,"Also, Tom is working on the next comic."
06-09-2018T20:28:42,ZahnHolley,How are ya guys?
06-09-2018T20:28:43,w0lfmare,"I do have some clothless character posts actually from style practices, but they're clearly unfinished, what with all the base lines still there"
06-09-2018T20:28:49,w0lfmare,ello zahn
06-09-2018T20:28:52,CrRAR,is that a Lynn afoot?
06-09-2018T20:28:55,Watsup,"they don't prescribe to the deviantart nude rules, anything that is suggestive or riding the pg-13 line is considered adult art to them"
06-09-2018T20:28:55,SageSaga,what if people are naked- under their clothes?
06-09-2018T20:28:56,Z3ppl1n,im pretty gud hbu?

06-09-2018T20:29:18,Nekonny,"no, they just reached a level where they are hgetting complains from high ranking people"
06-09-2018T20:29:31,TwokindsFan1,and hi w0lfmare
06-09-2018T20:29:42,Watsup,patreon is doing this because their payment processors have strict guidelines
06-09-2018T20:29:44,TwokindsFan1,love your channel too :3
06-09-2018T20:29:49,Ordithus,"Ron, it seems at least a girl in a bikin is OK"
06-09-2018T20:29:53,Ordithus,*bikini
06-09-2018T20:30:13,CrRAR,Lynn might be snooping for scandalousness.
06-09-2018T20:30:14,SageSaga,a cosplayer got hit- she has nothing as small as a bikini
06-09-2018T20:30:16,Combak,... So who's their payment processors?
06-09-2018T20:30:20,ZahnHolley,"I see an anthro foot,"
06-09-2018T20:30:32,TwokindsFan1,"question, is it legally allowed to be a basitin fox doge?"
06-09-2018T20:30:41,CrRAR,With Lynn's little jewelie on it.
06-09-2018T20:30:41,TwokindsFan1,and yes you do see an anthro foot
06-09-2018T20:30:43,Ordithus,"Huh.  Pretty soon they'll ban for too much ankle, then."
06-09-2018T20:30:49,Combak,"Also, hi new arrivals."
06-09-2018T20:31:17,Terryschannel,Hi
06-09-2018T20:31:21,Watsup,"patreon uses a lot of payment processors, I'd imagine it's either paypal or mastercard who have the aversion to adult content"
06-09-2018T20:31:25,w0lfmare,Wish there was a solid readable line between what's adult on Patreon and what isn't. The current rules are too vague
06-09-2018T20:31:38,gtaor,almost 100 viewers!!!
06-09-2018T20:31:41,TwokindsFan1,c: w0lfmare
06-09-2018T20:31:56,Ordithus,"w0lf, what you do, is almost certainly on the safe side :ptv-snicker:"
06-09-2018T20:31:59,SageSaga,yeah they are extremely vague
06-09-2018T20:32:01,w0lfmare,Hi two
06-09-2018T20:32:03,Bgrmystr2,"that's rather unfortunate, Wats, cuz that's how I pay for things"
06-09-2018T20:32:19,w0lfmare,Doesn't keep me from being paranoid Ord!
06-09-2018T20:32:39,SageSaga,both Patreon and Mastercard have issues with adult content
06-09-2018T20:32:51,SageSaga,along with every other US based credit card
06-09-2018T20:32:54,Ordithus,"When in doubt, panic is always the best response :ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake:"
06-09-2018T20:32:58,Terryschannel,Then don't be an adult
06-09-2018T20:33:00,ZahnHolley,Im getting addicted to baldis basics education and learning
06-09-2018T20:33:23,SageSaga,by most definitions nothing I do is adult material
06-09-2018T20:33:29,CrRAR,"They want to protect the innocents on their righteous crusade (and their own corporate images, le gasp)."
06-09-2018T20:33:31,Combak,"... I'd comment about how companies shouldn't be moral supervisors, but I guess there's some legal reasons for the issues..."
06-09-2018T20:33:36,SageSaga,well - adult only material to be specific
06-09-2018T20:33:47,Nekonny,Eye of the beholder and all that
06-09-2018T20:34:11,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, I don't think they have any business giving us shit on what we buy or sell. That's a privacy matter."
06-09-2018T20:34:23,Bgrmystr2,one clearly they do not value.
06-09-2018T20:34:31,CrRAR,I know a guy that started a construction business using hempcrete....
06-09-2018T20:34:41,CrRAR,U.S Bank wouldn't fund him
06-09-2018T20:34:52,w0lfmare,Well buying and selling some things are against the law
06-09-2018T20:34:57,TwokindsFan1,^
06-09-2018T20:34:59,Ordithus,They'd hit Michelangelo :ctwokinds-flomad:
06-09-2018T20:35:40,SageSaga,https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/payment-processors-are-still-policing-your-sex-life
06-09-2018T20:35:44,SageSaga,if yall wanna know more
06-09-2018T20:35:46,CrRAR,He went elsewhere for his business loans.
06-09-2018T20:36:15,Watsup,mastercard in particular is the most active in shutting down adult content from having access to payment services
06-09-2018T20:36:33,CrRAR,*reads sage's article; gets LERN'T*
06-09-2018T20:36:48,w0lfmare,"They should certainly have some control over what should and shouldn't be bought and sold, but I don't see why they should be handling censorship"
06-09-2018T20:36:51,Nekonny,whats their reason again?
06-09-2018T20:37:21,Watsup,"I mean, they are a company the offers a service, they deny that service to people who they don't want to have it, they don't actually need one"
06-09-2018T20:37:40,Vatruvius,"I am here! :ptv-greetings: Hello Tom, Sage, and Nekonny!"
06-09-2018T20:37:46,Watsup,but mastercard is pretty active in social things and shutting payment processing down for things they don't like
06-09-2018T20:37:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Vat
06-09-2018T20:37:48,CrRAR,evenin' Vat!

06-09-2018T20:38:09,FoxxTrotter,"Heya, Heresy."
06-09-2018T20:38:11,Nekonny,since when have credit  card companies have had a moral conscience?
06-09-2018T20:38:16,Ordithus,Hi Heresy
06-09-2018T20:38:35,w0lfmare,Hello Heresy
06-09-2018T20:38:46,Vatruvius,Credit car companies have a moral conscience!?
06-09-2018T20:38:48,SageSaga,since way back when adult material of all kinds was illegal
06-09-2018T20:38:49,Vatruvius,News to me!
06-09-2018T20:38:51,Combak,Hi Heresy.
06-09-2018T20:38:53,Sammit,Hi Heresy
06-09-2018T20:38:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Sage side note, did you see TFS DBZA 60 part 2?"
06-09-2018T20:38:56,Watsup,"having a moral conscience has become profitable in some businesses lately, or rather, not having one opens you up as a target"
06-09-2018T20:39:00,SageSaga,its a legal thing
06-09-2018T20:39:07,SageSaga,not yet Marv
06-09-2018T20:39:09,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-wink: Hiiiiiiiiiii~
06-09-2018T20:39:13,SageSaga,not a moral thing
06-09-2018T20:39:15,TwokindsFan1,hewwo :3
06-09-2018T20:39:16,unsteddyphoenix,I saw that Marv
06-09-2018T20:39:16,Vatruvius,Hello unsteddy.
06-09-2018T20:39:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi UNsteddy
06-09-2018T20:39:20,Watsup,and it's more like they don't feel associating with adult content is worth the image for themoney it pulls in
06-09-2018T20:39:25,Sammit,Hi Unsteddy
06-09-2018T20:39:26,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-katdryer: Hi unsted
06-09-2018T20:39:46,Watsup,"also, classicly, like in the early internet, CC companies didn't want to process payment for adult content because chargebacks were common"
06-09-2018T20:39:57,w0lfmare,ello unst
06-09-2018T20:40:13,Watsup,people viewing porn didn't like to admit it and when confronted by people with access to bank statements would deny and refund
06-09-2018T20:40:21,Nekonny,ah
06-09-2018T20:40:27,Watsup,kids would steal cc's and buy adult content and deny it
06-09-2018T20:40:32,SageSaga,"also by making adult material harder to process they create opportunities to make more money off of it, charging more to use another service to legally process them"
06-09-2018T20:40:43,Watsup,it just had a high charge back rate compared to other things you could buy and sell
06-09-2018T20:41:04,unsteddyphoenix,"Cant you just put ""no chargebacks"" in the T&C or whatever?"
06-09-2018T20:41:09,unsteddyphoenix,I think that's what Twitch does
06-09-2018T20:41:12,Bgrmystr2,lol phoenix nice of you to join us
06-09-2018T20:41:21,Watsup,"no, your cc processor doesn't care what your T&C say"
06-09-2018T20:41:23,unsteddyphoenix,That WAS nice of me. :)
06-09-2018T20:41:30,unsteddyphoenix,"Huh, I see."
06-09-2018T20:41:39,Watsup,"you call your CC company and say ""I didn't buy this"" and they reverse it"
06-09-2018T20:41:43,Watsup,Twitch will ban your account
06-09-2018T20:41:51,Watsup,"but if you legitimately didn't buy it, you get your money back"
06-09-2018T20:42:09,unsteddyphoenix,How is that proven?
06-09-2018T20:42:21,Nekonny,I got a few of those on my kickstarters
06-09-2018T20:42:34,Watsup,"if enough chargebacks happen, the CC processor starts to take small hits in money and customer service claims, so they stop accepting payment for your stuff"
06-09-2018T20:42:52,CrRAR,"Ha, Lynn trying to map the estate? Good luck with that."
06-09-2018T20:42:54,Watsup,"you don't have to prove it, part of using the CC processors payment systems is that you agree to let them reverse charges if fraud happens"
06-09-2018T20:42:59,CrRAR,"When he's done: ""‚àû"""
06-09-2018T20:43:04,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
06-09-2018T20:43:17,CrRAR,"""It's kind of... a freaky circle."""
06-09-2018T20:43:24,Watsup,"you, as someone who uses the service, doesn't get a say in whether or not the person who bought something can prove it, which is why porn refunds were so common"
06-09-2018T20:43:31,Ordithus,":ctwokinds-lynnsmile: ""A bureaucrat never stops.  Until designated break times"""
06-09-2018T20:43:43,Nekonny,Sellers get the short end of the stick
06-09-2018T20:43:46,unsteddyphoenix,Huh.I swear there was some sort of story about twitch trolls donating big $$ to streamers
06-09-2018T20:43:51,unsteddyphoenix,And then NOT getting away with it
06-09-2018T20:43:57,Watsup,"they got the porn, they get their money back, porn company is out money, cc processor had to handle a dispute, they aren't happen, it happens enough time they'll be blocked from the payment processor"
06-09-2018T20:43:59,unsteddyphoenix,"Donating just to refund later, I should say"
06-09-2018T20:44:06,Watsup,"well, yes"
06-09-2018T20:44:15,Combak,I'm pretty sure most places wait for the money to clear now...
06-09-2018T20:44:20,Watsup,Twitch is worth a lot of money and by using CC processors they make visa/mastercard/etc lots of money
06-09-2018T20:44:27,Watsup,amazon/twitch has leverage
06-09-2018T20:44:46,SageSaga,i get that Patreon might see some of my work at not for kids- it's not all for little kids- but i dont think it deserves to be age gated like it is porn
06-09-2018T20:44:48,CrRAR,'A' is for Alaric!
06-09-2018T20:44:51,CrRAR,\o/
06-09-2018T20:44:54,Watsup,"so they can say ""hey, we're getting trolls donating and taking their money back, you need to stop giving them their money back"""
06-09-2018T20:45:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,\o/
06-09-2018T20:45:04,Nekonny,^wisewat
06-09-2018T20:45:05,SageSaga,so i just want them to tell me what's too far
06-09-2018T20:45:07,Watsup,"porn doesn't have that pull, there isn't a central porn source"
06-09-2018T20:45:15,Bgrmystr2,"unfortunately, Patreon doesn't see anything beyond ""for all ages"" and ""not for all ages"""
06-09-2018T20:45:17,CrRAR,itsaas seeecret
06-09-2018T20:45:26,Bgrmystr2,they're super binary
06-09-2018T20:45:33,Watsup,"yep, again"
06-09-2018T20:45:37,Bgrmystr2,and that's a problem :/
06-09-2018T20:45:46,SageSaga,except Patreon cant allow people under 13 at all
06-09-2018T20:45:51,Watsup,Patreon does not perscribe to the same ruleset the rule of the internet uses for adult content that was built on top of DA rules
06-09-2018T20:46:02,SageSaga,at least not in the US - children under 13 cant sign up for anything on their own
06-09-2018T20:46:07,SageSaga,legally
06-09-2018T20:46:11,Combak,They lie.
06-09-2018T20:46:13,Watsup,"it's either general for all ages content, or it's adult content"
06-09-2018T20:46:38,Bgrmystr2,"yeh patreon doesn't seem to live in the real world, where there's more than just those two."
06-09-2018T20:46:40,Watsup,"yeah, but again, patreon is free to make that divide how they like, that's up to them"
06-09-2018T20:46:43,unsteddyphoenix,I see
06-09-2018T20:46:51,Watsup,they want to be on the ultra safe side of their payment processor rules
06-09-2018T20:46:57,Watsup,because they have no leverage
06-09-2018T20:47:01,unsteddyphoenix,That makes sense I suppose
06-09-2018T20:47:08,Watsup,"if mastercard and paypal pull out, patreon is dead"
06-09-2018T20:47:10,SageSaga,yeah- if they dont protect it then no one gets any money
06-09-2018T20:47:11,unsteddyphoenix,I mean I dont LIKE it
06-09-2018T20:47:12,SageSaga,i get it
06-09-2018T20:47:12,Katfeathers,heyyas
06-09-2018T20:47:24,CrRAR,ellooo
06-09-2018T20:47:26,Ordithus,I bet Lynn is wondering how Rose gets around this estate so well
06-09-2018T20:47:43,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, if Patreon keeps it up, someone's going to make an alternative, and people will leave patreon anyway"
06-09-2018T20:47:44,SageSaga,i just want them to draw some real lines - but they wont do that if someone pushes those lines forcing them to bend more
06-09-2018T20:47:57,SageSaga,i hope someone does make an alt- and i will use both
06-09-2018T20:48:04,Watsup,"well, yes, ideally that's how it goes bgr, eventually patreon gets competition, real competend competition"
06-09-2018T20:48:08,Watsup,and then they have to take more risks
06-09-2018T20:48:14,Nekonny,you can always use paypal direct
06-09-2018T20:48:15,Watsup,"right now, they have none, why risk anything"
06-09-2018T20:48:21,Nekonny,they have a monthly plan
06-09-2018T20:48:28,Watsup,yeah but people want a consolidated platform
06-09-2018T20:48:29,SageSaga,XD Patreon might just make an adult version of their own site themselves
06-09-2018T20:48:34,Watsup,they don't want to pledge to your paypal direct
06-09-2018T20:48:34,Ordithus,Or that coffee thing
06-09-2018T20:48:40,Nekonny,they want a wrapprer
06-09-2018T20:48:43,Watsup,yeah
06-09-2018T20:48:46,Watsup,so if someone comes along
06-09-2018T20:48:48,CrRAR,"""Perveon"""
06-09-2018T20:48:54,Watsup,and makes a nice wrapper that bundles people together like patreon does
06-09-2018T20:48:58,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
06-09-2018T20:49:02,Watsup,and takes that extra risk in policing content
06-09-2018T20:49:08,Bgrmystr2,"yeah.. With all this bs that patreon is doing, they're only damaging the relationship between themselves and the users."
06-09-2018T20:49:13,Watsup,patreon might also have to consider it
06-09-2018T20:49:40,Watsup,"I mean, they recently moveed their payment processor for adult accounts to the UK"
06-09-2018T20:49:49,Watsup,and decline rates have gone up to 20% for adult creators
06-09-2018T20:49:55,SageSaga,i just hope it was a bot that flagged me- because that means the robots think im sexy
06-09-2018T20:50:06,Bgrmystr2,lol sage
06-09-2018T20:50:08,Combak,I REALLY doubt that...

06-09-2018T21:23:42,ZRO4825,Michelle as Hoshiguma Yuugi. Status: Confirmed.

06-09-2018T21:24:46,ZRO4825,"Cuz if I'm not, I'm gonna try harder."
06-09-2018T21:24:50,SageSaga,It hasnt been confirmed
06-09-2018T21:25:01,SageSaga,but you may be the reason my patreon is now marked as +18
06-09-2018T21:25:21,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
06-09-2018T21:25:27,ZRO4825,Patreon's being frickin moronic lately 'bout that. They have multiple times marked a cosplayer I follow as adult and her stuff is nowhere NEAR 18+.
06-09-2018T21:25:56,Vatruvius,It is because they are a she ZRO...
06-09-2018T21:25:57,doomthedemonhedgehog,thanx for the stream guys and all but thats me bye all and have a great day night and all
06-09-2018T21:25:58,ZRO4825,"Honest truth, yours and Tom's stuff gets a hell of a lot closer to 18+ than any of that cosplayer's stuff ever has."
06-09-2018T21:26:00,Vatruvius,:thinking:
06-09-2018T21:26:04,Vatruvius,Now that makes no sense.
06-09-2018T21:26:29,ZRO4825,"Honestly, and for once, I think I can legitimately say, because boobs."
06-09-2018T21:26:36,ZRO4825,Because she happens to be capable of producing cleavage.
06-09-2018T21:26:42,SageSaga,Zro - Kinpatsu?
06-09-2018T21:26:45,Vatruvius,There you go.
06-09-2018T21:26:50,Bgrmystr2,they are prude police :u
06-09-2018T21:26:50,ZRO4825,Nein. Piggynukka
06-09-2018T21:26:55,Katfeathers,"ah bother, actually been up to long gotta quit out"
06-09-2018T21:27:07,Vatruvius,Didn't we identify the cause to be Paypal partnering with Patreon and Paypal wants nothing of it?
06-09-2018T21:27:10,ZRO4825,I do not know of a Kinpatsu. But I shall now investigate.
06-09-2018T21:27:36,Twokinds,brb
06-09-2018T21:27:42,Katfeathers,later
06-09-2018T21:27:51,SageSaga,Kinpatsu is far less adult than PiggyNukka and she got hit with it too
06-09-2018T21:28:23,ZRO4825,"Judging by what I'm seeing, Kinpatsu's done Android 21's Majin form. So I'd say they're 'bout equal, lol."
06-09-2018T21:28:33,ShadowSoap,Good Evening everyone!
06-09-2018T21:28:46,CrRAR,evenin'!
06-09-2018T21:28:47,Vatruvius,"Note to self, when I start posting my own stuff on Patreon just flag it all 18+ if it has any boob or butt, any at all."
06-09-2018T21:28:49,boiguy123,hello

06-09-2018T23:14:40,SageSaga,but eating all of it is a sure way to get sick
06-09-2018T23:14:45,ZRO4825,The one here is open till 1

06-09-2018T23:17:13,Combak,Allergies or something more complex?
06-09-2018T23:17:27,Bgrmystr2,I don't think anyone would want to eat in any problems.. but yknow

06-09-2018T23:18:50,boiguy123,yep
06-09-2018T23:19:50,Bgrmystr2,Probably less of things defrosting and more of not being refridgerated properly and spoiling
06-09-2018T23:20:56,SageSaga,Fridge is suposed to be repaired Monday
06-09-2018T23:21:20,Bgrmystr2,hope it all works out lol

06-09-2018T23:24:15,SageSaga,it would be 14 miles total
06-09-2018T23:24:26,Ordithus,"Ayy, my commute"
06-09-2018T23:24:30,ZRO4825,One way that's about a tenth of what I drive each day on average ^_^
06-09-2018T23:24:47,JamesBSquirrel3,"Oh I get it! You told us last week that storm just happen mentioned, was it that right has cause it, is it Sage?"
06-09-2018T23:25:17,SageSaga,not sure if the storm broke it or what- but the fan that moves the cold air from the bottom to the top stopped working
06-09-2018T23:25:32,SageSaga,so only the bottom of the fridge stays cold- but too cold- it freezes everything
06-09-2018T23:26:00,ZRO4825,Yowch. No bueno.
06-09-2018T23:26:19,Bgrmystr2,"my mini-fridge has the same issue, but reverse."
06-09-2018T23:26:38,Bgrmystr2,"the cooling coils are on the top, so everything on the top freezes, but even milk spoils if put on the bottom"
06-09-2018T23:27:05,Bgrmystr2,"but it's made this way, so... I know the feeling"
06-09-2018T23:29:53,JamesBSquirrel3,"So what now, is there Snacks left, Sage?:worried:"

06-09-2018T23:40:20,JamesBSquirrel3,"Wal-mart, eh Sage? What's your favourite to eat at least?"
06-09-2018T23:40:54,SageSaga,Place that serves food that I can consume without becoming sick or a fountain of acid.
06-09-2018T23:41:11,Ordithus,This is good criteria to have
06-09-2018T23:41:17,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
06-09-2018T23:41:33,Bgrmystr2,"maybe it's not food that hates you, but your body that hates food."
06-09-2018T23:41:45,Alphawolf333,"Heading to bed, Thanks for the streams all"
06-09-2018T23:41:53,Bgrmystr2,gnight alpha
06-09-2018T23:41:55,SageSaga,no - body clearly loves food
06-09-2018T23:42:12,Ordithus,"Sage, what food do you like?"
06-09-2018T23:42:12,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-confused: uh..
06-09-2018T23:42:21,SageSaga,to not die body would consume food even if it caused pain
06-09-2018T23:42:28,Bgrmystr2,fountain of acid seems to tell me otherwise.
06-09-2018T23:42:43,FenceEqualizer,Sounds like your body is against you
06-09-2018T23:42:50,SageSaga,everything is against me
06-09-2018T23:42:59,FenceEqualizer,Well then.
06-09-2018T23:43:09,FenceEqualizer,Tom's not against you.
06-09-2018T23:43:25,JamesBSquirrel3,"Wait-a-minute, you don't like any partically allegy food came from? What was it in any don't like?"

06-09-2018T23:43:41,unsteddyphoenix,That's what I do
06-09-2018T23:43:45,JamesBSquirrel3,Sage?
06-09-2018T23:43:59,SageSaga,"chicken and rice doesnt murder me. Most beef things with no tomato based sauce is ok, salad but not even all salads- especially with tomatoes-"
06-09-2018T23:44:05,FenceEqualizer,You can't eat those Unsteddy
06-09-2018T23:44:12,Bgrmystr2,"James.. if you're trying to ask what sage doesn't like / cannot eat, then that list is probably bigger than the list of foods he can eat lol"
06-09-2018T23:44:25,SageSaga,a single banana
06-09-2018T23:44:25,Ordithus,"You can, if you really want to, Fence"
