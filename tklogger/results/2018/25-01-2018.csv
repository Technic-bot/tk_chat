25-01-2018T00:09:59,RedDeath2018,Windows XP style
25-01-2018T01:59:38,TheBeckoner,How's the comic stuff coming along Tom?
25-01-2018T04:03:50,Dadrobit,Heading to bed have a good one y'all!
25-01-2018T04:15:05,TheBeckoner,You too Robit. I'm heading to bed myself.
25-01-2018T07:20:27,MidnightBlue78,Good Morning! :ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
25-01-2018T07:24:49,Azumachan,O/
25-01-2018T07:34:24,RedDeath2018,Morning
25-01-2018T12:40:50,TheBeckoner,Goodo morningo dudeos
25-01-2018T16:19:23,RedDeath2018,Done with school dudes
25-01-2018T17:42:45,tehbear,good night
25-01-2018T17:44:17,RedDeath2018,Good night?
25-01-2018T17:47:39,tehbear,its 23:47 here
25-01-2018T17:48:05,tehbear,i was checking picarto in hope that there was a stream
25-01-2018T17:48:33,tehbear,have become addicted to twokinds
25-01-2018T17:53:20,TheFDdriver,is that good or bad?
25-01-2018T17:55:06,Bgrmystr2,You know..
25-01-2018T17:55:13,Bgrmystr2,the stream times are posted above the chat
25-01-2018T17:55:22,Bgrmystr2,9pm Eastern on Friday
25-01-2018T17:55:40,Bgrmystr2,"same time on Wed, usually"
25-01-2018T17:55:49,Bgrmystr2,and 4pm Sunday
25-01-2018T17:59:09,tehbear,"ah, right. 9pm eastern is 3am here."
25-01-2018T18:01:33,RedDeath2018,Dang bri
25-01-2018T18:01:36,RedDeath2018,Bro
25-01-2018T18:04:35,Bgrmystr2,"Well, don't sleep at night"
25-01-2018T18:04:37,Bgrmystr2,sleep during the day
25-01-2018T18:04:40,Bgrmystr2,:D
25-01-2018T18:05:31,tehbear,"right now im at the point where im too tired to do anything useful, but still dont want to sleep :P"
25-01-2018T18:05:34,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, technically it IS doable. People go to school or work.. and then come home and spend hours doing whatever, then sleep through the stream and wake up the next day and do it all over again"
25-01-2018T18:06:09,Bgrmystr2,"All I'm saying is to go to school / work, then go home and sleep, then be awake during the stream, THEN go to work at the end of what your day would be."
25-01-2018T18:06:31,Bgrmystr2,"you still get the same amount of sleep hours, still go to work or school, whatever yer business is"
25-01-2018T18:06:45,Bgrmystr2,and still the same amount of hours at home doing whatever
25-01-2018T18:06:57,Bgrmystr2,it now lines up with the stream which you can then watch live.
25-01-2018T18:07:19,tehbear,hehehe. priorities priorities.
25-01-2018T18:07:23,Bgrmystr2,xD
25-01-2018T18:07:54,Bgrmystr2,most people I meet don't have a MAJOR requirement of actually being awake in the afternoon
25-01-2018T18:08:05,Bgrmystr2,generally speaking
25-01-2018T18:08:16,Bgrmystr2,"only need sleep, and need to do the school or work thing"
25-01-2018T18:08:19,Bgrmystr2,and that's about it
25-01-2018T18:08:21,TheFDdriver,you're right
25-01-2018T18:08:29,Bgrmystr2,homework doesn't specify it has to be done during the day
25-01-2018T18:08:43,tehbear,"yeah, it aint called daywork"
25-01-2018T18:08:45,Bgrmystr2,xD
25-01-2018T18:08:53,TheBeckoner,lol
25-01-2018T18:08:58,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, I've done it before"
25-01-2018T18:09:00,Bgrmystr2,I know it's possible
25-01-2018T18:09:08,Bgrmystr2,ppl just don't think about it that way :u
25-01-2018T18:09:20,TheFDdriver,you make it possible
25-01-2018T18:09:33,tehbear,"actually, being a night owl that might make me more productive"
25-01-2018T18:10:01,Bgrmystr2,"It's possible in general, FD, people just gotta realize that very little actually requires people to do X at X time"
25-01-2018T18:10:11,Bgrmystr2,school and work tend to require specific time
25-01-2018T18:10:14,Bgrmystr2,but sleep does not
25-01-2018T18:10:18,Bgrmystr2,homework does not
25-01-2018T18:10:28,TheFDdriver,thats the problem
25-01-2018T18:10:34,tehbear,especially in these days where a lot of work and collaboration is asyncronous anyways
25-01-2018T18:11:01,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, if you're sleeping AND going to work every single day"
25-01-2018T18:11:06,Bgrmystr2,and then go home only to sleep
25-01-2018T18:11:08,Bgrmystr2,you have no life.
25-01-2018T18:11:09,Bgrmystr2,literally
25-01-2018T18:11:17,Bgrmystr2,I know people like that too
25-01-2018T18:11:24,TheFDdriver,i still have my time
25-01-2018T18:11:34,Bgrmystr2,"that's good, don't waste it"
25-01-2018T18:11:34,TheFDdriver,personal time
25-01-2018T18:11:43,Bgrmystr2,"friend of mine.. has 3 hours a week, if he's lucky"
25-01-2018T18:11:52,TheFDdriver,he is
25-01-2018T18:11:57,tehbear,he works a 7 day week?
25-01-2018T18:12:07,tehbear,not even god did that
25-01-2018T18:12:45,Bgrmystr2,"not really, he works most of the week, goes to school the other parts of the week, but he's on call for work 24/7 and has to take care of his family"
25-01-2018T18:12:53,Bgrmystr2,so he has basically zero free time
25-01-2018T18:13:14,Bgrmystr2,no life.
25-01-2018T18:13:23,tehbear,that sucks. i think i would be stressed out if i were him.
25-01-2018T18:13:27,TheFDdriver,I use part of my sleep when is stream day
25-01-2018T18:13:39,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, bear"
25-01-2018T18:13:41,Bgrmystr2,he is
25-01-2018T18:13:44,Bgrmystr2,it sucks
25-01-2018T18:13:58,Bgrmystr2,the rare occurance when he comes by he just kinda.. lays in my bed and does nothing
25-01-2018T18:14:08,Bgrmystr2,which is a start contrast to the usual
25-01-2018T18:14:11,Bgrmystr2,so I think it's nice
25-01-2018T18:14:15,TheBeckoner,Well I dont blame him for that lol
25-01-2018T18:14:20,Bgrmystr2,right? same here
25-01-2018T18:14:29,TheFDdriver,yep
25-01-2018T18:14:35,TheFDdriver,just ded time
25-01-2018T18:14:39,Bgrmystr2,xD
25-01-2018T18:14:45,TheBeckoner,I certaintly would not be ablt to do that for any long period of time.
25-01-2018T18:15:08,TheFDdriver,i can but would be frustrated
25-01-2018T18:15:21,Bgrmystr2,Hmm... I think he's been going on this same schedule for .. 4 or 5 years now?
25-01-2018T18:15:27,Bgrmystr2,something to that effect
25-01-2018T18:15:46,Bgrmystr2,"maybe a bit less than that, but"
25-01-2018T18:15:48,Bgrmystr2,should be about
25-01-2018T18:15:59,tehbear,"i suppose if work feels meaningful enough, and you dont feel like youre missing your family it could work. but you do need time to decompress...."
25-01-2018T18:16:01,TheFDdriver,prob got used to
25-01-2018T18:16:32,Bgrmystr2,"he goes home to his family anyway, so that's not a prob for him, bear xD"
25-01-2018T18:17:01,Bgrmystr2,"the guy needs to unwind, but never can"
25-01-2018T18:17:16,Bgrmystr2,He's really the only exception to what I would consider a flippable schedule
25-01-2018T18:17:16,TheFDdriver,he needs a free day
25-01-2018T18:17:24,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, a day just for him"
25-01-2018T18:17:29,TheFDdriver,i mean week
25-01-2018T18:17:43,Bgrmystr2,"He'd take a day, nevermind a week"
25-01-2018T18:17:47,Bgrmystr2,a week would be vacation xD
25-01-2018T18:18:23,TheBeckoner,At Least with that schedule vacations seem really long I would think.
25-01-2018T18:18:24,TheFDdriver,yes
25-01-2018T18:18:48,TheFDdriver,some people consider it as days off
25-01-2018T18:19:05,TheFDdriver,i dont know why thought

25-01-2018T19:33:46,RedDeath2018,Well qwe I bet it was hard though so thatâ€™s probably the reason
25-01-2018T19:34:16,qwe304,it looked like they used markers
25-01-2018T19:34:25,qwe304,and the proportions were off
25-01-2018T19:34:45,RedDeath2018,Oh
25-01-2018T19:34:51,TheFDdriver,hmm
25-01-2018T19:34:57,RedDeath2018,Well they were unprofessional
25-01-2018T19:35:09,RedDeath2018,Iâ€™m not professional either

25-01-2018T19:39:37,TheFDdriver,I was waiting for that
25-01-2018T19:39:38,Bgrmystr2,yeah a lot of porportions are way off on that image
25-01-2018T19:39:57,TheFDdriver,starting with the chest
25-01-2018T19:40:00,TheFDdriver,...
25-01-2018T19:40:07,RedDeath2018,Yeah and the eyes looked very weird and evil
25-01-2018T19:41:19,TheFDdriver,"seriously, what happened to her chest"
25-01-2018T19:41:33,Bgrmystr2,the same thing that happened with her leg
25-01-2018T19:41:41,Bgrmystr2,"just, someone that doesn't porportion right"
25-01-2018T19:41:43,Bgrmystr2,a lot of people do that
25-01-2018T19:41:47,Bgrmystr2,it's very common starting out
25-01-2018T19:42:10,RedDeath2018,They were being nice and gave flora her dream. A big chest
25-01-2018T19:42:28,Bgrmystr2,"it's not even all that much bigger than the real thing, it's just shaped strangely"
25-01-2018T19:42:37,RedDeath2018,Yeah
25-01-2018T19:42:41,TheFDdriver,yes
25-01-2018T19:43:02,qwe304,"i just finished replacing the battery and screen on an iphone, if i nerer service another apple product, it will still be too soon"
25-01-2018T19:43:04,RedDeath2018,I hope that the creator isnâ€™t looking about us bashing it
25-01-2018T19:43:20,Bgrmystr2,that's really the only problem with the image imo Anatomy.
25-01-2018T19:43:25,Bgrmystr2,I'm not bashing it
25-01-2018T19:43:28,Bgrmystr2,why would you be?
25-01-2018T19:43:37,Bgrmystr2,anatomy is a BITCH to learn
25-01-2018T19:43:45,qwe304,idk who made it
25-01-2018T19:43:55,Bgrmystr2,even professionals have problems with anatomy
25-01-2018T19:44:03,TheFDdriver,you can learn from his mistakes
25-01-2018T19:44:10,RedDeath2018,Exactly
25-01-2018T19:44:26,RedDeath2018,But anatomy is a b***h
25-01-2018T19:44:34,qwe304,i always use refrences when drawing non-oc stuff
25-01-2018T19:44:35,Bgrmystr2,Even tom looked at one of his pieces of Kat from last year and said something to the sort that it was off
25-01-2018T19:44:46,Bgrmystr2,it does happen
25-01-2018T19:45:17,Bgrmystr2,"it's just a matter of learning anatomy and what body shapes are what size specifically, etc"
25-01-2018T19:45:28,Bgrmystr2,The pose looks fine
25-01-2018T19:45:35,TheFDdriver,true
25-01-2018T19:45:50,TheFDdriver,its just the shape
25-01-2018T19:46:52,RedDeath2018,its a really good pose. But hey if it was awhile ago he may have gotten better
25-01-2018T19:46:56,Bgrmystr2,I think whoever drew it will be a really good artist once they get anatomy down
25-01-2018T19:47:10,RedDeath2018,Ditto
25-01-2018T19:47:15,qwe304,"im pretty good at spacial reasoning, i can imagine domthing, and come up with to how light and shadow it,  etc"
25-01-2018T19:47:31,TheFDdriver,"lol, red"
25-01-2018T19:47:42,RedDeath2018,What?
25-01-2018T19:47:48,Bgrmystr2,"the details aren't bad, the fur, the stripes, colors, etc"
25-01-2018T19:47:56,Bgrmystr2,"they look a bit rough, but otherwise ok"
25-01-2018T19:48:22,TheFDdriver,is just that line on the white
25-01-2018T19:48:26,Bgrmystr2,there's only so much you can do with physical coloring items ll
25-01-2018T19:48:29,Bgrmystr2,lol*
25-01-2018T19:48:34,RedDeath2018,They didnâ€™t shade the picture
25-01-2018T19:48:49,TheFDdriver,i can let that pass
25-01-2018T19:48:51,Bgrmystr2,shading is another level of art entirely
25-01-2018T19:48:51,qwe304,i did my pfp with pens and pastels
25-01-2018T19:49:40,RedDeath2018,Hey I experimented oil pastels but I donâ€™t think I did it right
25-01-2018T19:50:14,RedDeath2018,Experimented with oil pastels
25-01-2018T19:50:22,qwe304,lemme see
25-01-2018T19:50:29,TheFDdriver,how that whent

25-01-2018T19:53:01,RedDeath2018,Thatâ€™s not my actual paper itâ€™s my experimenting paper so I didnâ€™t ruin the picture
25-01-2018T19:53:45,TheFDdriver,but that eye bro
25-01-2018T19:53:52,RedDeath2018,What
25-01-2018T19:53:52,TheFDdriver,noice
25-01-2018T19:53:56,qwe304,thats how they work
25-01-2018T19:54:08,qwe304,you have to push hard for darked colors
25-01-2018T19:54:24,RedDeath2018,Ohhhhhhhh
25-01-2018T19:54:44,qwe304,they can be light or dark
25-01-2018T19:54:57,qwe304,thats one of their advantages
25-01-2018T19:55:03,RedDeath2018,I see
25-01-2018T19:55:15,RedDeath2018,I just gotta keep practicing
25-01-2018T19:55:18,TheFDdriver,either way looks nice
25-01-2018T19:55:32,RedDeath2018,Thanks
25-01-2018T19:55:46,TheFDdriver,no problem
25-01-2018T19:56:18,TheFDdriver,should I consider having an art class?
25-01-2018T19:56:22,qwe304,"https://imgur.com/1TRSc2r i use a black pastel over the ink lines, then smudged them together to darken the colors around the edge"
25-01-2018T19:57:07,TheFDdriver,that is a different style?
25-01-2018T19:57:14,TheFDdriver,of drawing?
25-01-2018T19:57:26,RedDeath2018,Probably
25-01-2018T19:58:04,TheFDdriver,cause dont know anything 'bout art
25-01-2018T19:58:29,RedDeath2018,I donâ€™t either Iâ€™m just doing it
25-01-2018T19:58:41,RedDeath2018,And miraculously itâ€™s good
25-01-2018T19:58:57,TheFDdriver,have you ever had an art class

25-01-2018T20:02:30,RedDeath2018,Then everybody died
25-01-2018T20:03:16,TheFDdriver,caused an nuclear reaction causing an worldwide explosion
25-01-2018T20:03:37,RedDeath2018,Lol

25-01-2018T20:04:28,TheFDdriver,the more i think about something the more hard it is to do
25-01-2018T20:04:35,RedDeath2018,Same
25-01-2018T20:05:03,TheFDdriver,"its like ""FOCUS MAN"""
25-01-2018T20:05:19,TheFDdriver,*it made it worst*
25-01-2018T20:05:34,RedDeath2018,Ikr

25-01-2018T20:15:42,RedDeath2018,But honestly music isnâ€™t as fun as you would think
25-01-2018T20:15:53,RedDeath2018,Iâ€™ve been playing for years

25-01-2018T20:40:11,TheFDdriver,ok
25-01-2018T20:40:24,TheFDdriver,btw Puerto Rican
25-01-2018T20:40:25,qwe304,i know how to swear in russian
25-01-2018T20:40:31,Bgrmystr2,"there's always streams on friday, FD. Sage, Tom, and Ron always multistream. Sometimes one of em doesn't make it, but usually all three of em are there"
25-01-2018T20:40:46,Bgrmystr2,"Never saw a time where Sage wasn't, for sure."
25-01-2018T20:41:11,TheFDdriver,thats for the reminder Bgr
25-01-2018T20:41:57,Bgrmystr2,"the friday streams are long-running, before I actually started watching"
25-01-2018T20:41:59,Combak,"Well, Sage is the host, so..."
25-01-2018T20:42:12,Bgrmystr2,"before the patreon streams started, as well"
25-01-2018T20:42:22,RedDeath2018,I thought tom was the host
25-01-2018T20:42:29,TheFDdriver,same
25-01-2018T20:42:30,Bgrmystr2,why would you think that?
25-01-2018T20:42:33,qwe304,technically noy
25-01-2018T20:42:38,Bgrmystr2,tom's not the first one there
25-01-2018T20:42:39,qwe304,*not
25-01-2018T20:42:47,Bgrmystr2,and usually never the first one there
25-01-2018T20:42:55,qwe304,hes the reason moost show up though
25-01-2018T20:43:06,Bgrmystr2,"while that may be true, that doesn't mean he's the host."
25-01-2018T20:43:40,TheFDdriver,just an admin
25-01-2018T20:43:40,Bgrmystr2,there are still a lot of people that show up even if tom doesn't stream
25-01-2018T20:43:41,qwe304,it doesnt really matter
25-01-2018T20:43:49,RedDeath2018,Oh ok
25-01-2018T20:43:53,qwe304,if hes host
25-01-2018T20:44:09,Bgrmystr2,"Actually, it very much does. Changing the host changes the ruleset of the multistream"
25-01-2018T20:44:12,TheFDdriver,true
25-01-2018T20:44:38,qwe304,rules? usually they are the same from sage to tom
25-01-2018T20:44:50,Bgrmystr2,"Because sage hosts it, sage has rules that everyone follows"
25-01-2018T20:44:56,Bgrmystr2,"and no, qwe"
25-01-2018T20:44:59,Bgrmystr2,not every one
25-01-2018T20:45:13,qwe304,sage needs to learn to chill
25-01-2018T20:45:23,RedDeath2018,Wait there are rules
25-01-2018T20:45:29,RedDeath2018,What are they
25-01-2018T20:45:32,qwe304,just basic stuff
25-01-2018T20:45:35,Bgrmystr2,"there's always rules, Red"
25-01-2018T20:45:44,Bgrmystr2,brb food beeping
25-01-2018T20:45:46,qwe304,dont link when the stream is on without asking
25-01-2018T20:46:05,qwe304,no excessive swearing
25-01-2018T20:46:12,qwe304,"no spamming, the norm"
25-01-2018T20:46:18,TheFDdriver,or not been able to chat if you are a guess
25-01-2018T20:46:32,TheFDdriver,guest
25-01-2018T20:46:37,RedDeath2018,Ok I can live with those
25-01-2018T20:46:54,RedDeath2018,I never cursed and if I do I bleep them out
25-01-2018T20:47:34,TheFDdriver,i half bleep them
25-01-2018T20:47:39,RedDeath2018,Lol
25-01-2018T20:47:50,TheFDdriver,just to make people understand
25-01-2018T20:48:20,RedDeath2018,Is that your method
25-01-2018T20:48:26,TheFDdriver,yes
25-01-2018T20:48:45,RedDeath2018,Lol
25-01-2018T20:49:13,TheFDdriver,like as#%@^*
25-01-2018T20:49:25,RedDeath2018,I get it
25-01-2018T20:49:35,Bgrmystr2,There is no rule for cursing
25-01-2018T20:49:36,Bgrmystr2,at all
25-01-2018T20:49:37,TheFDdriver,see what i mean
25-01-2018T20:49:41,Bgrmystr2,in any of th streams
25-01-2018T20:49:43,Bgrmystr2,that's not a thing.
25-01-2018T20:49:57,TheFDdriver,just for precautions
25-01-2018T20:50:24,Bgrmystr2,You'll probably bother people more doing that and just saying it
25-01-2018T20:50:47,TheFDdriver,then should I stop?
25-01-2018T20:51:09,Bgrmystr2,"That's up to you, really"
25-01-2018T20:51:34,TheFDdriver,well sometimes I am to lazy to bleep them
25-01-2018T20:51:43,RedDeath2018,drawing nat is harder than I thought
25-01-2018T20:51:46,Bgrmystr2,"The rules for Sage's stream are asking for permission before posting links, saying what the link is first, generally not being a dickbag. Also, that puns are only tolerated."
25-01-2018T20:51:59,Bgrmystr2,Both Sage and tom tend to delete people in the chat self-promoting
25-01-2018T20:52:08,Bgrmystr2,deleting messages and such
25-01-2018T20:52:14,qwe304,sage can be an ass sometimes
25-01-2018T20:52:23,Bgrmystr2,"It's in sage's rules, but tom also follows it"
25-01-2018T20:52:28,Bgrmystr2,in his streams as well
25-01-2018T20:52:28,RedDeath2018,He didnâ€™t delete me last night thankfully
25-01-2018T20:52:43,RedDeath2018,I showed some of my artwork
25-01-2018T20:52:50,Bgrmystr2,"Generally, just don't self-promote and such, during the stream"
25-01-2018T20:52:58,RedDeath2018,Oh ok
25-01-2018T20:53:26,Bgrmystr2,"when there isn't a stream, it's not a big deal, but you just know when to not do it"
25-01-2018T20:53:29,Bgrmystr2,which is more often than not
25-01-2018T20:53:31,RedDeath2018,So no drawing updates during the stream
25-01-2018T20:53:38,RedDeath2018,Got it
25-01-2018T20:53:54,TheFDdriver,well i dont have any of those
25-01-2018T20:53:59,TheFDdriver,so i am fine
25-01-2018T20:54:39,Bgrmystr2,You can see the rules of the friday streams under sage's page here https://picarto.tv/SageSaga
25-01-2018T20:55:01,TheFDdriver,lets look
25-01-2018T20:55:09,Bgrmystr2,"Originally, when Picarto did multi-streams, there was a section for the host that would show up on all streams"
25-01-2018T20:55:13,Bgrmystr2,so sage posted the rules there
25-01-2018T20:55:21,Bgrmystr2,and it showed up on tom and ron's stream when they joined
25-01-2018T20:55:38,Bgrmystr2,but they changed the way the descriptions work since then
25-01-2018T20:56:04,Bgrmystr2,"recently-ish, within the past 5 months or so"
25-01-2018T20:56:30,Bgrmystr2,and they haven't set up where the multi-stream box shows up on all streams in the multi
25-01-2018T20:56:35,RedDeath2018,She is a little mean
25-01-2018T20:56:44,RedDeath2018,About this type of stuff
25-01-2018T20:56:46,Bgrmystr2,"either they haven't done that yet, or they chose not to do it"
25-01-2018T20:57:02,Bgrmystr2,"when people join your stream posting links to viruses, what would you do? lol"
25-01-2018T20:57:08,TheFDdriver,what are puns
25-01-2018T20:57:12,TheFDdriver,Â¿?
25-01-2018T20:57:19,Bgrmystr2,"if you have to ask, look it up xD"
25-01-2018T20:57:33,RedDeath2018,Oh i see why now
25-01-2018T20:57:38,TheFDdriver,too lazy to do it
25-01-2018T20:58:03,Bgrmystr2,too lazy to tell you then :v
25-01-2018T20:58:11,RedDeath2018,Puns seriously I knew what they meant when I was 5
25-01-2018T20:58:24,TheFDdriver,XD

25-01-2018T20:59:18,Bgrmystr2,Ron just went live lol
25-01-2018T20:59:27,Bgrmystr2,Puns are just a play on words
25-01-2018T20:59:45,Bgrmystr2,not that you'd prolly understand what that means
25-01-2018T20:59:52,Bgrmystr2,since most people seem to not
25-01-2018T20:59:55,RedDeath2018,Some puns are really stupid

25-01-2018T21:32:45,ZRO4825,"Okay, so, judging by that commentary, he must be the main guuy from Witcher, lol"
25-01-2018T21:32:45,SageSaga,as for MHW - enjoying it a lot- wanna play more
25-01-2018T21:32:45,Tharkis,but i do have a few ps4 games &gt;_&lt;
25-01-2018T21:32:51,Bgrmystr2,I've never played any of the Witcher games and even I know relatively who it is

25-01-2018T21:33:06,Tharkis,"I've got Utawarerumono 2 and 3, which in English were only ps4 releases"

25-01-2018T21:33:25,Dumdodoor,You get to play other upcomming games before that.
25-01-2018T21:33:36,Dumdodoor,So you got lots of time to wait and try out new stuff. :)
25-01-2018T21:33:39,Tharkis,"the original 2002 Utawarerumono is being re-released, all remastered and updated, for ps4 but no announcment if they're doing an english release of the original still =("
25-01-2018T21:33:44,aeoronwah,I'm waiting a couple weeks to buy it on PS4 since I just registered for AC and that cast me close to $1200

25-01-2018T21:47:27,Serpentfrog,Does she look like a spitfire?
25-01-2018T21:47:30,unsteddyphoenix,She could be spitting hot fire there
25-01-2018T21:47:48,MrEase,It would be a neat touch if the spit take turned into steam
25-01-2018T21:47:50,Bgrmystr2,"well, no, phoenix, I don't know this, but she's drinking water, so it stands to reason it's most likely water spittake"
25-01-2018T21:47:53,Combak,... She didn't then.
25-01-2018T21:48:06,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe she's drinking vodka :O
25-01-2018T21:48:06,Combak,"IE, at least she didn't breathe fire!"

25-01-2018T22:01:55,Bgrmystr2,rofl the live time for tom's stream is broken for me. Says he's been live for 5+ hrs

25-01-2018T22:02:25,ZRO4825,"If they don't want their sketches, Sage, I'll take'em. We can always use more Relm in skimpy outfits. :P"
25-01-2018T22:02:53,Serpentfrog,I was watching this while traveling at the speed of light so the time isn't broken.
25-01-2018T22:02:54,Tharkis,lol
25-01-2018T22:03:49,CrRAR,That's quite interesting considering FD just reported feeling heavier than usual.
25-01-2018T22:04:03,CrRAR,something's afoot
25-01-2018T22:04:16,ZRO4825,"I was just talking to the Shredder, does that count? :o"
25-01-2018T22:04:23,KarmaTheAngelDragon,"Wow, twokinds draws super fast xD"
25-01-2018T22:04:34,TheFDdriver,prob the reason that i waited 6 hours for the stream
25-01-2018T22:04:35,ZRO4825,He is indeed skilled.
25-01-2018T22:04:36,Serpentfrog,"Why is it that to be afoot, something must be at hand? :thinking:"
25-01-2018T22:04:56,ZRO4825,"Because some of us can't figure out one end from the other, Serp."
25-01-2018T22:05:22,ZRO4825,"Wait, one of your undecideds is Heretic?"
25-01-2018T22:05:31,ZRO4825,"Oh, wait, different person than I'm thinking, nvm"
25-01-2018T22:05:41,Serpentfrog,"Just because you couldn't tell doesn't mean you're not the father, ZRO."

25-01-2018T22:06:34,Serpentfrog,You said it is alarm.
25-01-2018T22:06:41,ZRO4825,"that would be ""its,"" not ""it's"""
25-01-2018T22:06:43,Ordithus,"It is indeed, alarm."
25-01-2018T22:06:44,Bgrmystr2,Apostrophy is posession.
25-01-2018T22:06:49,Mihari,^_^;
25-01-2018T22:06:51,ZRO4825,Not with that word
25-01-2018T22:07:05,Crehvan,"The word it's is always short for 'it is' (as in it's raining), or in informal speech, for 'it has' (as in it's got six legs). The word its means 'belonging to it'"
25-01-2018T22:07:11,Whitestripes,And that is your grammar lesson for today kids!

25-01-2018T22:07:46,ZRO4825,He's face to face with a dragon. Little bit panicky.
25-01-2018T22:07:51,Whitestripes,He is wet
25-01-2018T22:08:05,Dumdodoor,"A lot of people use ""your"" when they meant to say ""you're"""
25-01-2018T22:08:26,Dumdodoor,Kind of a pet peeve to me.
25-01-2018T22:08:26,Nekonny,You're all wet
25-01-2018T22:08:42,Nekonny,?
25-01-2018T22:08:47,Nekonny,that was correct
25-01-2018T22:08:53,Mihari,It was also a lie.
25-01-2018T22:08:56,Nekonny,you are all wet
25-01-2018T22:08:58,TheFDdriver,xd

25-01-2018T22:09:27,Serpentfrog,But is water wet?

25-01-2018T22:09:34,Dumdodoor,See? Ron knows. ZRo knows.

25-01-2018T22:10:01,Bgrmystr2,xD sage
25-01-2018T22:10:01,Nekonny,Ive drawn a wet mihari before

25-01-2018T22:10:06,ZRO4825,:thinking: Sage has a point there.
25-01-2018T22:10:08,Nekonny,that didn't come out right
25-01-2018T22:10:09,BadFoMo,Reni: (under breath) ...Yet.

25-01-2018T22:11:29,Tharkis,awwww so cute!
25-01-2018T22:11:31,Mihari,"No, that looks like a rubber me in the rain."
25-01-2018T22:11:32,Ordithus,"Yeah, she's wet."
25-01-2018T22:11:32,Dumdodoor,Awwwwww. Cute! :D
25-01-2018T22:11:37,Dumdodoor,And wet.
25-01-2018T22:11:39,Nekonny,wet fur
25-01-2018T22:11:41,Whitestripes,Reni spitting should be an emote
25-01-2018T22:11:43,Tharkis,but.. if you're rubber you shouldnt mind the rainstorm!
25-01-2018T22:11:44,Tharkis,shiny!
25-01-2018T22:11:46,Mihari,Doesn't look like that XD

25-01-2018T22:12:07,Nekonny,2012
25-01-2018T22:12:14,Tharkis,i'm going to guess 6 or 7 years old
25-01-2018T22:12:17,Tharkis,oops well i was close =D
25-01-2018T22:12:19,Bgrmystr2,The fur is too thin to make it look wet
25-01-2018T22:12:34,Dumdodoor,Very close! Still looks impressive in my opinion.
25-01-2018T22:12:36,Mihari,That's most crappy excuse I've ever heard.
25-01-2018T22:12:43,SageSaga,that was actually Michelle in a Latex Mihari Costume
25-01-2018T22:12:48,ZRO4825,XD
25-01-2018T22:13:14,Serpentfrog,I actually had a classmate back in the day who legitimately claimed his dog ate his homework.
25-01-2018T22:13:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Ello o/

25-01-2018T22:14:20,MagicEnchilladas,that is impressive nekonny
25-01-2018T22:14:27,Ordithus,He better dry off before he catches a cold
25-01-2018T22:14:30,Nekonny,Get out of the rain mihari YOU'RE getting all wet
25-01-2018T22:14:31,Whitestripes,Someone hand Sythe a towl
25-01-2018T22:14:43,Nekonny,another good example :P
25-01-2018T22:14:45,Tharkis,Mihari's spots might wash off with that downpour =)
25-01-2018T22:14:49,Mihari,I gotta try this...
25-01-2018T22:14:50,CrRAR,Reni can dry him with a little fyah
25-01-2018T22:14:55,Dumdodoor,Wuh-oh. Lol!

25-01-2018T22:15:09,CrRAR,She made him wet she can fix it!
25-01-2018T22:15:10,MrEase,well the spit take is probably hot due to dragon-ness
25-01-2018T22:15:11,Nekonny,wonders what she is up to
25-01-2018T22:15:15,ZRO4825,lmao

25-01-2018T22:15:32,Mihari,"Actually you can't, but you can kick him"
25-01-2018T22:15:40,Tharkis,"nooo, save the drawing cat!"
25-01-2018T22:15:43,SageSaga,i can ban him and remove him
25-01-2018T22:15:45,Nekonny,reminds me of another drawing
25-01-2018T22:15:45,Serpentfrog,But onlyh when he's down.
25-01-2018T22:15:55,Tharkis,stands in the way as a bodyguard for Nekonny
25-01-2018T22:16:07,MrEase,or the sythnado whch is the only weapon that can cut through mekkan armour
25-01-2018T22:16:09,aeoronwah,"I think I'm gonna head out early tonight, my fever hasn't gone down since this morning, so I might try to get some sleep"

25-01-2018T22:18:15,Whitestripes,I wonder if Tom is using a custom brush right now for line art
25-01-2018T22:18:15,Dumdodoor,It's priceless. xD
25-01-2018T22:18:22,Mihari,You've obviously never seen the ocelots in Minecraft.
25-01-2018T22:18:35,Serpentfrog,Ocelots aren't cheetahs.
25-01-2018T22:18:47,Mihari,"I didn't say they were, but they do tails."
25-01-2018T22:19:02,Mihari,So obviously not 0
25-01-2018T22:19:29,Bgrmystr2,Mihari has a point

25-01-2018T22:19:49,Mihari,I'm certainly not.
25-01-2018T22:20:04,Tharkis,though i think technically my OC is part of 'team spots'
25-01-2018T22:20:07,ZRO4825,Snow Leopards &gt; other cats &gt; other animals :P

25-01-2018T23:58:03,unsteddyphoenix,Her size adjusts for the cuteness variable
25-01-2018T23:58:09,CrRAR,Fantastic elastic dragon
25-01-2018T23:58:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,dragons get smol when receiving back scratches
25-01-2018T23:58:22,SageSaga,Reni has always been pretty small...
25-01-2018T23:58:27,RedDeath2018,The point of view from where the comic looks from
25-01-2018T23:58:28,Nekonny,she drank shrinking water
25-01-2018T23:58:30,unsteddyphoenix,"Though yeah, she kinda looks like she could barely carry one person"
25-01-2018T23:58:34,MatyMaty,her wings are not in view
25-01-2018T23:58:41,MatyMaty,so she looks smaller
25-01-2018T23:58:45,RedDeath2018,True
25-01-2018T23:58:46,CrRAR,soon she will fit in SOMEONE ELSES pocket
25-01-2018T23:58:47,Tharkis,mini dwagon of DOOM! &lt;3

25-01-2018T23:59:06,SageSaga,she's long/tall not really big
25-01-2018T23:59:08,Unenlagia,Don't make me link tiny Smaug!
25-01-2018T23:59:12,CrRAR,Needs to get her sleepy butt around somehow
25-01-2018T23:59:18,Unenlagia,"doesn't think he can, actually."
25-01-2018T23:59:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,is that a dragon in your pocket or are you excited to see me
25-01-2018T23:59:34,CrRAR,XD
25-01-2018T23:59:38,RedDeath2018,Just give her the growing potion then she can give you a free ride and maybe crash
25-01-2018T23:59:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,oh shit it is a dragon
25-01-2018T23:59:55,CrRAR,*hiss*
