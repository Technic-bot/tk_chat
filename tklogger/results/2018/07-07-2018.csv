07-07-2018T12:48:43,Combak,"So, I’m pretty sure I know the answer to this, but is Tom streaming today?"
07-07-2018T13:25:52,Dadrobit,"No he is not. The Sunday sketches are either postponed, or he will choose them himself and do it offscreen."
07-07-2018T13:26:24,Dadrobit,"""There will not be a sketch stream on Sunday July 8, as I am away at a convention. The stream will either be postponed or fulfilled offline, depending on circumstances. """
07-07-2018T13:27:00,Dadrobit,"If he does them himself, I hope he hasn't already chosen from what was submitted before today, only just got mine in."
07-07-2018T13:42:05,Xexanoth,"i think he will only look at them when he actually gets around to doing them, so you should be fine"
07-07-2018T14:21:12,JamesBSquirrel3,"Ooo boy, what a hot day.:ptv-sleepy: It amaze F1 British GP has so much modevations can happening. But enough some involves I just talk to myself. So I got prepare a Poll Sketch ready so in around more than 45 mins.:ptv-condescending:"
07-07-2018T14:23:56,JamesBSquirrel3,"I wonder Tom's thinking about? I'm always thinking about TwoKinds Concert, can something brings, whatever it will work?:ptv-wondering:"
07-07-2018T14:46:45,WereKeidran,strolls into the chatroom
07-07-2018T14:46:57,JamesBSquirrel3,"Well no matter who can a TwoKinds Concert Plan? I don't mind and either you'll don't want to, &lt;15 mins to go!"
07-07-2018T14:48:32,Bgrmystr2,how would there be a concert if there's no music?
07-07-2018T14:48:36,Bgrmystr2,it's just a webcomic
07-07-2018T14:49:43,JamesBSquirrel3,"Well not really, a TwoKinds Concert Sketch, not live music, I meant drawn"
07-07-2018T14:53:48,PalmettoPathfinder1,Okay I found this on Steam!
07-07-2018T14:53:52,PalmettoPathfinder1,https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1434291846&searchtext=
07-07-2018T14:54:01,JamesBSquirrel3,:sunny: Aww man its so hot in a UK! I can't barely to this uncomforable sleep
07-07-2018T14:54:19,PalmettoPathfinder1,I apologize for posting without asking but I was so surprised to see this i had to show it to y'all.
07-07-2018T14:55:21,JamesBSquirrel3,"Okay I can see a website has it you got,"
07-07-2018T14:57:07,JamesBSquirrel3,&gt;5 mins
07-07-2018T14:57:58,PalmettoPathfinder1,The Keidran Dominion = TwoKinds in Space!  Well I never thought anyone would do that actually and since we're all TK fans I thought I share it with y'all.
07-07-2018T15:01:24,Bgrmystr2,meh. and you should prolly think outside the box if you thought noone would ever do that
07-07-2018T15:02:16,TheGamePlayer,Lol cool mod
07-07-2018T15:03:35,PalmettoPathfinder1,Well I wasn't sure if there were a lot of furries playing Stellaris.  I mean I have a friend of mine who told me that the furry races in WoW are actually the least played races.
07-07-2018T15:04:13,TheGamePlayer,I'll have to check it out
07-07-2018T15:04:18,PalmettoPathfinder1,And I have heard talk that furries aren't well liked in the gaming community.
07-07-2018T15:04:47,PalmettoPathfinder1,It seems to be an interesting mod GamePlayer.
07-07-2018T15:06:18,JamesBSquirrel3,Hey Palmetto! I'm in Account!:ptv-greetings:
07-07-2018T15:07:09,TheGamePlayer,I fear that battlefield 1 is broken for awhile...
07-07-2018T15:07:51,WereKeidran,:ctwokinds-nibjump::ctwokinds-nibjump::ctwokinds-nibjump:
07-07-2018T15:08:13,JamesBSquirrel3,"Now where Tom, he should apply for us. He always prepare things now, he should be ready. Are you in here us Tom?:ptv-wondering:"
07-07-2018T15:08:51,PalmettoPathfinder1,Sweet James!  :)
07-07-2018T15:09:08,TheGamePlayer,"I'm getting black screens there are visible options but no background art, constant server disconnect before even joining, and sometimes freezes up."
07-07-2018T15:09:56,Natkatt,:ptv-sneakysmirk:
07-07-2018T15:10:10,Bgrmystr2,"James, we've already said this before. Tom is at a convention, there is no stream today."
07-07-2018T15:11:00,Bgrmystr2,"He's been at the con since thursday, and will continue to be there through today."
07-07-2018T15:11:38,JamesBSquirrel3,"Oh really Bgr?! Why wouldn't tell me, and others?"
07-07-2018T15:11:48,Bgrmystr2,he'll probably be driving home either tonight or monday
07-07-2018T15:11:49,Bgrmystr2,and he DID
07-07-2018T15:11:51,Bgrmystr2,several times
07-07-2018T15:12:03,Bgrmystr2,and lots of people have been repeating it
07-07-2018T15:12:09,Bgrmystr2,you're just not bothering to pay attention
07-07-2018T15:13:38,JamesBSquirrel3,"I was busy in other things watching like motorsports, now I didn't know why now he change?"
07-07-2018T15:13:52,Bgrmystr2,"https://twitter.com/Katbox_Comics/status/1004462922574131201 This was posted June 6th, over a month ago, which tom retweeted."
07-07-2018T15:14:24,Bgrmystr2,"https://twitter.com/TwoKinds/status/1007437369535057926 tom posted this on the 14th of June, also last month"
07-07-2018T15:14:39,Bgrmystr2,and he's noted the convention probably dozens of times during the streams
07-07-2018T15:14:56,Bgrmystr2,nevermind all the ppl repeating it
07-07-2018T15:15:29,Bgrmystr2,we knew he was going to it before either of those were even posted.
07-07-2018T15:15:35,Bgrmystr2,"so it's entirely on you, bro."
07-07-2018T15:15:36,MallardDuckAvia,When will there be a stream?
07-07-2018T15:15:40,Bgrmystr2,not today.
07-07-2018T15:15:46,MallardDuckAvia,I know.
07-07-2018T15:15:47,JamesBSquirrel3,"Oh Damnit to myself! I knew this was my Tweet meant, now I shouldn't know better"
07-07-2018T15:15:54,Bgrmystr2,then we don't know Mallard.
07-07-2018T15:15:58,MallardDuckAvia,Ok
07-07-2018T15:15:59,Bgrmystr2,noone does.
07-07-2018T15:16:31,MallardDuckAvia,Frick. This is one of the last streams before I miss 2 weeks at Oshkosh
07-07-2018T15:16:42,JamesBSquirrel3,"So No this weeked I afraid, right?"
07-07-2018T15:17:02,Bgrmystr2,"maybe monday night or tues night, he may just do the sketches offline."
07-07-2018T15:17:15,Bgrmystr2,we'll find out when tom comes back
07-07-2018T15:17:53,MallardDuckAvia,Of course he’s gone for the week before Oshkosh too. Dang
07-07-2018T15:26:03,JamesBSquirrel3,"Okay. I can however there possible - some of you know of YouTube. But not now, but later depends can be happening updates inform after the events of 5th + 8th July. So I learn once again as it is stands."
07-07-2018T15:28:02,JamesBSquirrel3,"It is Katbot events after all, no harm feelings (at least).:ptv-scratch:"
07-07-2018T15:29:00,JamesBSquirrel3,"Well, I'm off to bed now, until my works tomorrow. See'ya!:ptv-ice:"
07-07-2018T15:40:09,ProsePro7,Tom said anything yet?
07-07-2018T15:42:12,Mippy,About what?
07-07-2018T15:43:22,ProsePro7,If the stream is today
07-07-2018T15:45:32,HeresyArtStream,"I think Tom is at Anthrocon, although it's curious that he had backer suggestions open this week."
07-07-2018T15:45:44,HeresyArtStream,Just remember that it might have been an oversight!
07-07-2018T15:46:43,ProsePro7,"Well, Ill hang out for a while.  If he's gotta work he's gotta work.  Hope he has fun"
07-07-2018T15:47:01,Mippy,He is at Anthrocon. Most of us knew in advance. On Patreon he said that the stream may be postponed or he might do some sketches on his own.
07-07-2018T15:47:19,Mippy,We might get a “Tom Pick Week”
07-07-2018T15:51:26,ProsePro7,"Yeah I was tracking that he might be there but the open suggetion thing made me think he was gonna do it.  Oh well have fun Tom hope you pick mine if you do some,"
07-07-2018T16:15:25,Bgrmystr2,he's not gonna be back till late tonight or sometime tomorrow
07-07-2018T16:15:53,Bgrmystr2,"and he's already said he's gonna get suggestions anyway, it was not an oversight"
07-07-2018T16:16:22,Bgrmystr2,we'll either get a late stream or not get a stream and all the sketches will be done offline
07-07-2018T16:21:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Be honest: how appealing is a hotdog from Walmart for lunch to you
07-07-2018T16:35:30,Dadrobit,If it's a Hebrew National. I'm all for it.
07-07-2018T16:53:00,Bgrmystr2,"meh, I like ball park"
07-07-2018T16:55:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t know the brand but I know they’re cooking them in a bag in boiling water
07-07-2018T17:25:50,SpazztasticKiwi,They’re also giving us breakfast stuff to start selling
07-07-2018T17:47:26,Char89TheCharizard,"Hey. I assume, there's no sketch stream today?"
07-07-2018T17:49:34,Char89TheCharizard,Why do I feel like I just killed the chat... *leaves*
07-07-2018T17:50:13,Bgrmystr2,yeh no stream today cuz tom's at a convention
07-07-2018T18:02:36,Dadrobit,Sous Vide Hotdogs huh?
07-07-2018T18:04:12,NightMeaty22,Hello
07-07-2018T18:04:55,Dadrobit,o7
07-07-2018T19:53:38,TorqueEmUp,Anyone else here besides manage to go to AnthroCon?
07-07-2018T19:53:50,TorqueEmUp,besides me*
07-07-2018T19:54:08,Bgrmystr2,"nope, I don't have the money for that shit :u"
07-07-2018T19:54:27,TorqueEmUp,Neither did I. lol
07-07-2018T19:54:42,Bgrmystr2,"you went, didn't you?"
07-07-2018T19:54:49,Bgrmystr2,that's the difference.
07-07-2018T19:54:49,TorqueEmUp,Yup
07-07-2018T19:54:53,Bgrmystr2,so you had the money
07-07-2018T19:54:58,TorqueEmUp,barely
07-07-2018T19:55:09,Bgrmystr2,ppl like me do not :v
07-07-2018T19:55:18,Bgrmystr2,and have no expectation of being able of doing so
07-07-2018T19:55:29,TorqueEmUp,Also depends on distance
07-07-2018T19:55:49,TorqueEmUp,I lived only like 4 hours away from pitsburgh
07-07-2018T19:56:05,TorqueEmUp,live*
07-07-2018T19:56:52,TorqueEmUp,Understandably living too far away would make going to these things too pricey.
07-07-2018T19:56:56,Bgrmystr2,16 hr drive away for me
07-07-2018T19:57:11,Bgrmystr2,though not having a car makes it.. a little bit longer
07-07-2018T19:57:20,Bgrmystr2,$200 for a one-way flight :u
07-07-2018T19:57:37,Bgrmystr2,and that's on the super cheap end
07-07-2018T19:57:47,Bgrmystr2,probably going as luggage :v
07-07-2018T19:58:11,TorqueEmUp,I just got lucky and it was close. A round trip cost like a little over $30 in gas.
07-07-2018T19:58:26,Bgrmystr2,"see, that's why"
07-07-2018T19:58:28,Bgrmystr2,:P
07-07-2018T19:58:44,TorqueEmUp,and it's best to have friends to split the costs
07-07-2018T19:58:54,TorqueEmUp,"hotel, gas, parking, etc"
07-07-2018T19:59:18,Bgrmystr2,I'd have to shell probably $400+ just on travel expenses nevermind having to pay for the hotel or have money for the con itself.
07-07-2018T19:59:31,TorqueEmUp,"and I am cheap, I get a hotel about 20min from the Con."
07-07-2018T19:59:33,Bgrmystr2,I don't really have anyone capable of going that far for a con
07-07-2018T20:00:08,TorqueEmUp,Hotels right next to the cons are like $150-$250+ a night
07-07-2018T20:00:27,TorqueEmUp,"20min out of town, it's like $65 a night."
07-07-2018T20:00:36,CrRAR,How was the general turnout?
07-07-2018T20:00:56,TorqueEmUp,Like overall attendance for the whole thing?
07-07-2018T20:01:01,TorqueEmUp,Or for Tom?
07-07-2018T20:01:06,Bgrmystr2,not being able to drive kinda forces having a hotel next to it.
07-07-2018T20:01:15,Bgrmystr2,:/
07-07-2018T20:01:16,TorqueEmUp,Right
07-07-2018T20:01:41,TorqueEmUp,"Also I am sure if you fursuit/cosplay, a hotel connected to the convention center would be best. lol"
07-07-2018T20:01:41,Bgrmystr2,"me going to anthrocon, including tickets, would probably end up being $1000 just for one person"
07-07-2018T20:01:50,TorqueEmUp,Yeouch
07-07-2018T20:02:01,TorqueEmUp,"As for attendance, they astimated 8k+ people"
07-07-2018T20:02:05,TorqueEmUp,estimated*
07-07-2018T20:02:07,Bgrmystr2,but that's for any convention I have to go to outside of my state.. so
07-07-2018T20:02:13,Bgrmystr2,"that's actually fairly normal, Torque"
07-07-2018T20:02:22,Bgrmystr2,if you're not traveling by car and don't live close to it
07-07-2018T20:02:40,Bgrmystr2,and that's cheap compared to going to cons where the flight alone can be upwards of $900+
07-07-2018T20:02:54,TorqueEmUp,like over 1k+ people in the fursuit parade.
07-07-2018T20:03:33,TorqueEmUp,"Tom sold out of his Raine, Natani, and Kat prints, and I guess he had a few Flora ones at the start, but guess he didn't have many of those and sold them out fast."
07-07-2018T20:03:56,TorqueEmUp,"also sold out on his artbook, and another book or two."
07-07-2018T20:04:15,Bgrmystr2,I wonder if there was a line for his table
07-07-2018T20:04:21,Bgrmystr2,at the beginning of the first day
07-07-2018T20:04:59,TorqueEmUp,"From the people I knew there visiting from the discord, yeah he did/"
07-07-2018T20:05:46,Bgrmystr2,"pity. I'd like to end up getting some of the stuff he sells at cnos, but I suck at mornings"
07-07-2018T20:05:49,Bgrmystr2,so I'm always late
07-07-2018T20:05:57,Bgrmystr2,ons* even
07-07-2018T20:06:03,Bgrmystr2,asjkfga cons** &gt;.&gt;
07-07-2018T20:06:06,TorqueEmUp,"Reese from the discord was on staff there, and went straight there, and asked Tom about sketch commisions, and ran back up to his room to get his notebook, came back down and aparently Tom was already completely booked up for sketches."
07-07-2018T20:06:25,Bgrmystr2,ew reese :v
07-07-2018T20:06:50,Bgrmystr2,"interesting, he works on staff huh?"
07-07-2018T20:06:50,TorqueEmUp,*shrug*
07-07-2018T20:06:51,Bgrmystr2,cool
07-07-2018T20:07:09,TorqueEmUp,"Yep, and he got a picture with Tom while he was in his fursuit."
07-07-2018T20:07:28,Bgrmystr2,lol he has fursuit too? :o
07-07-2018T20:07:42,CrRAR,"Good con then for him, got to drive home muuuuch lighter."
07-07-2018T20:07:53,CrRAR,:ok_hand:
07-07-2018T20:07:55,TorqueEmUp,"yup, but he didn't wear it much considering he was staff."
07-07-2018T20:08:01,CrRAR,haha
07-07-2018T20:08:12,CrRAR,The best way to hide in plain sight xD
07-07-2018T20:08:30,Dadrobit,Completely sold out of his stuff? Tom's made some dosh off of this lol.
07-07-2018T20:08:46,CrRAR,haha
07-07-2018T20:08:55,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-adiracoin:
07-07-2018T20:09:12,TorqueEmUp,Well didn't completely sell out of everything. But he sold a good chunk of stuff.
07-07-2018T20:09:23,TorqueEmUp,"All the prints like I had said, and Artbooks"
07-07-2018T20:09:23,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, that's the story I hear every time Tom goes to a con"
07-07-2018T20:09:28,Bgrmystr2,so I dunno why this one's special lol
07-07-2018T20:09:30,Dadrobit,First day?
07-07-2018T20:09:49,Bgrmystr2,"from what I was told, he sells most of his stuff every con he goes to"
07-07-2018T20:09:58,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
07-07-2018T20:10:08,TorqueEmUp,"Nah, not first day. But he stopped taking sketch commisions within the first hour of the first day."
07-07-2018T20:10:26,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's gonna be a given
07-07-2018T20:10:32,Bgrmystr2,cuz everyone wants their own sketch lol
07-07-2018T20:10:32,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, well I rarely hear about his trips to other cons."
07-07-2018T20:10:41,TorqueEmUp,since he goes to so few
07-07-2018T20:10:45,Bgrmystr2,you should ask more questions then
07-07-2018T20:10:48,Bgrmystr2,:)
07-07-2018T20:11:42,TorqueEmUp,"I know during the first day, the guy like almost never sat down, his table always had somebody there."
07-07-2018T20:13:20,TorqueEmUp,He did recognize me right off the bat since I had my name from here on my badge.
07-07-2018T20:13:44,Bgrmystr2,oh did you? lolo
07-07-2018T20:13:50,TorqueEmUp,"Whether that's a good or bad thing, who knows. lol"
07-07-2018T20:14:07,TorqueEmUp,Well nobody there had their real name on their con badges
07-07-2018T20:14:11,Bgrmystr2,is the badge text big enough to read from far away? :o
07-07-2018T20:14:29,Bgrmystr2,lol everyone's afraid of being themselves
07-07-2018T20:14:33,Bgrmystr2,sounds about right
07-07-2018T20:14:39,TorqueEmUp,"No, as soon as I walked up to buy some stuff, he noticed it right then."
07-07-2018T20:14:49,TorqueEmUp,so
07-07-2018T20:14:51,TorqueEmUp,*shrug
07-07-2018T20:14:52,Bgrmystr2,Ah I see
07-07-2018T20:15:56,TorqueEmUp,"Bought all 4 of the paperbacks, a print copy of Pixie Panic, and one of each of the prints he still had left. (Kat, Natani, and Raine)"
07-07-2018T20:16:18,Bgrmystr2,was he selling any hardbacks?
07-07-2018T20:16:38,TorqueEmUp,"Yup, but I was scraping by at this con, so paperback it was. lol"
07-07-2018T20:17:02,CrRAR,haha
07-07-2018T20:17:15,Bgrmystr2,I see
07-07-2018T20:17:25,TorqueEmUp,"also free poster, and Flora bookmark"
07-07-2018T20:17:39,Dadrobit,Hopefully he's pricing aggressively.
07-07-2018T20:17:40,Bgrmystr2,how much was like... everything? :thinking:
07-07-2018T20:18:04,TorqueEmUp,"Paperbacks were $15 each, prints were $5 each"
07-07-2018T20:18:14,TorqueEmUp,I think Pixie Panic was $10
07-07-2018T20:18:26,TorqueEmUp,Artbook was $30
07-07-2018T20:18:33,Bgrmystr2,guessing the hardbacks would be like $20 or so?
07-07-2018T20:18:48,Dadrobit,Dude could easily double his prices tb
07-07-2018T20:18:50,Dadrobit,tbh
07-07-2018T20:19:01,Bgrmystr2,"that'd be kind of a lot, dadro"
07-07-2018T20:19:01,CrRAR,"Ooo, he still does the Flora bookmarks? Are they the ones where she's, like, laminated?"
07-07-2018T20:19:03,TorqueEmUp,"Probably more, probably whatever they are on his store page."
07-07-2018T20:19:19,Dadrobit,"Not really, prints often go for $15 each alone"
07-07-2018T20:19:27,TorqueEmUp,Everything was priced exactly what it was on his store page.
07-07-2018T20:19:54,Dadrobit,Poor guy is shorting himself.
07-07-2018T20:19:57,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, he could have easily asked for double on those prints"
07-07-2018T20:19:57,Bgrmystr2,"$40 for a book is a lot, dude"
07-07-2018T20:20:02,CrRAR,lol
07-07-2018T20:20:08,Dadrobit,"It's a con, everything is meant to be expensive"
07-07-2018T20:20:20,TorqueEmUp,Not really
07-07-2018T20:20:21,Dadrobit,And furrys are (pardon the pun) cash cows
07-07-2018T20:20:33,Bgrmystr2,"way to support price gouging, dadro xD"
07-07-2018T20:20:46,CrRAR,"Mayyybe not double, but like an extra 5 bucks wouldn't hurt."
07-07-2018T20:20:50,Dadrobit,Gotta keep the lights on
07-07-2018T20:20:55,TorqueEmUp,"I saw the Sabrina Online Hardbacks at a book vendor, and I wish I had the money for them, but I was flat broke by then, those were $25 each."
07-07-2018T20:21:07,CrRAR,mmm
07-07-2018T20:21:38,CrRAR,High volume vs high margin
07-07-2018T20:21:41,CrRAR,FIGHT
07-07-2018T20:22:01,TorqueEmUp,"But yeah, like practically ALL the other vendors were charging $10 for their prints, and were lower quality than Tom's"
07-07-2018T20:22:01,Dadrobit,brb
07-07-2018T20:22:04,CrRAR,kk
07-07-2018T20:22:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I wish he had pins
07-07-2018T20:22:30,CrRAR,:ptv-excited:
07-07-2018T20:22:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d buy a Nibbly pin in a heartbeat
07-07-2018T20:22:37,TorqueEmUp,"Not lower quality art wise, just print, and medium."
07-07-2018T20:23:04,TorqueEmUp,Yeah I probably would too.
07-07-2018T20:23:12,TorqueEmUp,But I want plushies more
07-07-2018T20:23:14,CrRAR,"mmm, I wonder if he orders in enough quantity to keep margin low at the quality he attains."
07-07-2018T20:23:32,CrRAR,Plushies! :ctwokinds-sleepoverA:
07-07-2018T20:23:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Ah yes a Nibbly plush
07-07-2018T20:23:43,TorqueEmUp,"He did have to round the corners on the Natani prints by hand, because the printer send them to him unrounded."
07-07-2018T20:23:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Because there’s not enough merch stuff on my bed already
07-07-2018T20:23:54,Bgrmystr2,"if he's selling out at cons, he's not getting enough of quantity of items for a convention."
07-07-2018T20:24:06,Bgrmystr2,that's basic
07-07-2018T20:24:20,TorqueEmUp,just had one of those tools that rounds edges of paper.
07-07-2018T20:24:27,CrRAR,"Well, only as much as he can pack in his car."
07-07-2018T20:24:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I did see that picture of him and a few others from that Katbox tweet
07-07-2018T20:24:50,Bgrmystr2,"well, he's not alone in his book production, Cr"
07-07-2018T20:24:50,CrRAR,...or van... or 2K-mobile
07-07-2018T20:24:54,TorqueEmUp,"Indeed, as he drove out to this one. I don't know what he does for San Diego Comic Con"
07-07-2018T20:25:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Want to know who that chick was with all the pink
07-07-2018T20:25:09,Bgrmystr2,he's using the keenspot shop to sell books
07-07-2018T20:25:13,CrRAR,ooo
07-07-2018T20:25:18,CrRAR,yeah
07-07-2018T20:25:18,TorqueEmUp,That sounds like he has to pay some good money to get his product all the way out to Cali
07-07-2018T20:25:33,CrRAR,Where is Keenspot located?
07-07-2018T20:25:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Google it
07-07-2018T20:25:51,CrRAR,Maybe they can drop ship things to comic-con?
07-07-2018T20:25:54,TorqueEmUp,"Hmm, you know I didn't even bother to think about that"
07-07-2018T20:25:55,SpazztasticKiwi,May have more than one hub
07-07-2018T20:26:18,CrRAR,"""Apple Valley, CA"""
07-07-2018T20:26:20,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, I am sure he just has Keenspot ship them to the conventions."
07-07-2018T20:26:44,SpazztasticKiwi,And then they have fun taking them out of alllll the boxes and organizing it
07-07-2018T20:27:08,TorqueEmUp,because he did say he had to hold back shipments of books from people that ordered them online so he could have stuff to sell at cons.
07-07-2018T20:27:31,TorqueEmUp,"Wish he had his T-Shirts there, i'd have bought one."
07-07-2018T20:27:47,TorqueEmUp,But probably too limited of booth space for that
07-07-2018T20:27:59,CrRAR,"Yeh, Apple Valley is a little over 2hrs from SDCC."
07-07-2018T20:28:01,TorqueEmUp,He was pretty filled up with just the books and such.
07-07-2018T20:28:20,CrRAR,mmm
07-07-2018T20:28:52,CrRAR,Shirts are probably 3rd party printed-on-demand maybe?
07-07-2018T20:29:08,CrRAR,Soft goods supply is always weird in low quantities.
07-07-2018T20:29:29,CrRAR,That's why plushies are tough to get off the ground.
07-07-2018T20:29:54,CrRAR,Need a huge order to make it worthwhile for the designer.
07-07-2018T20:30:05,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, like he said he has interest in selling plushies. Though from what someone asked him at this con, if he does plushies, Flora would probably get one before nibbly."
07-07-2018T20:30:16,TorqueEmUp,But likes the idea of a Nibbly plush
07-07-2018T20:30:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Less stuffing involved with a Flora plush than a Nib plush
07-07-2018T20:30:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Nibbly keychains
07-07-2018T20:31:29,CrRAR,Yeah like those metal enamel-filled ones from the 80's!
07-07-2018T20:32:10,TorqueEmUp,enamel-pins seem to be pretty big thing at con
07-07-2018T20:32:13,TorqueEmUp,cons*
07-07-2018T20:32:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a Septiceye Sam keychain. Love the thing to death. A Nibs one - just a little sitting position Nibs - too cute
07-07-2018T20:32:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe with an acorn
07-07-2018T20:32:48,TorqueEmUp,"Keychains I saw very little of, unless it was at a weeb stall. :P"
07-07-2018T20:33:02,TorqueEmUp,weeb vendor*
07-07-2018T20:33:03,CrRAR,"yeah, literally just the one used for the ""Squirrely Support"" on patreon would do."
07-07-2018T20:33:08,Bgrmystr2,"Kiwi, you said chick with all the pink. I don't see anything like that. What are you looking at?"
07-07-2018T20:33:15,CrRAR,Just replace the heart with an acorn xD
07-07-2018T20:34:03,TorqueEmUp,enamel-pins are quite pricey for what they are though
07-07-2018T20:34:28,TorqueEmUp,like $10 everywhere at the con
07-07-2018T20:34:32,SpazztasticKiwi,The pic with like half of Tom in it. The pink behind him
07-07-2018T20:34:37,TorqueEmUp,there was a con exclusive one for AC this year.
07-07-2018T20:35:32,Bgrmystr2,"oh, lesse"
07-07-2018T20:36:53,TorqueEmUp,Also here is Resse in his fursuit with Tom. This was taken yesterday. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/165725395348357120/465240087555211294/IMG_20180707_145233.jpg
07-07-2018T20:37:00,Bgrmystr2,"Kiwi, on the top right of that image is a poster for Las Lindas http://laslindas.katbox.net/"
07-07-2018T20:37:12,Bgrmystr2,The one below was a poster for Rascals http://rascals.katbox.net/
07-07-2018T20:37:56,Bgrmystr2,"ohshit, I recognise the artist at the very end of that image, Torque"
07-07-2018T20:39:24,TorqueEmUp,Yeah other Katbox comic artists were there.
07-07-2018T20:40:21,TorqueEmUp,Uberquest's Skidd and Phuufy were there to the left of Tom.
07-07-2018T20:40:42,Bgrmystr2,I'm not talking about that
07-07-2018T20:40:47,Bgrmystr2,I'm talking about the one wayyy at the end
07-07-2018T20:40:50,Bgrmystr2,with the two dakis
07-07-2018T20:41:08,Bgrmystr2,that's one of the artists here on picarto that has a super 80's anime artstyle
07-07-2018T20:41:16,Bgrmystr2,it's really cool
07-07-2018T20:41:37,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, I think they were all generally on the same area on purpose. :P"
07-07-2018T20:41:44,TorqueEmUp,in*
07-07-2018T20:42:46,TorqueEmUp,https://twitter.com/Katbox_Comics/status/1015259431586525184
07-07-2018T20:43:27,CrRAR,I'm sure if they book early enough they kind of get to coordinate the table arrangements.
07-07-2018T20:43:49,CrRAR,esp if they fall under an umbrella like Katbox or Keenspot.
07-07-2018T20:44:18,Bgrmystr2,"it's katbox, they're gonna get all their tables together cuz they're all basically one entity"
07-07-2018T20:44:51,TorqueEmUp,Indeed
07-07-2018T20:45:04,CrRAR,mmm
07-07-2018T20:45:56,TorqueEmUp,"Also you can barely make out in that picture with Tom and Reese, you can kinda see Tom's phone background."
07-07-2018T20:46:06,TorqueEmUp,:P
07-07-2018T20:46:26,Bgrmystr2,Found them
07-07-2018T20:46:42,Bgrmystr2,"https://picarto.tv/NaiChanTV this was the artist at the end of the image you posted from discord, w/ the two dakis"
07-07-2018T20:46:46,Bgrmystr2,they're super good
07-07-2018T20:47:03,TorqueEmUp,Also the sketch he was working on is right there on the table.
07-07-2018T20:47:16,Bgrmystr2,Nai was actually super excite to be going to a con w/ tom and being able to meet him
07-07-2018T20:48:13,TorqueEmUp,"Oh wait that isn't his background, I believe he had that up as a reference for that sketch, as that isn't the picture I saw, when I bought stuff from him. lol"
07-07-2018T20:49:00,Dadrobit,Back with Ramen and Fish
07-07-2018T20:50:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"And with that, I’m reminded of the fact I was getting up to make food before I got distracted"
07-07-2018T20:50:52,TorqueEmUp,"Oh nice, where is she from? since her offline picture clearly says ""Going to America!"""
07-07-2018T20:52:35,TorqueEmUp,"But anway, I hope Tom does choose all the suggestions this week and does them offline."
07-07-2018T20:53:46,Bgrmystr2,"Not quite sure, actually"
07-07-2018T20:54:41,Bgrmystr2,"Huh, DA says New Zealand"
07-07-2018T20:54:43,Bgrmystr2,another Kiwi
07-07-2018T20:54:55,SpazztasticKiwi,🥝
07-07-2018T20:57:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"The new post, by the way - Raine Rose AU"
07-07-2018T20:57:43,SpazztasticKiwi,sounds like a perfume
07-07-2018T20:57:48,qwe304,wasnt that done like a month ago?
07-07-2018T20:58:45,SpazztasticKiwi,It shows posted on Patreon at 11 something today
07-07-2018T20:59:13,qwe304,i mean when it was drawn
07-07-2018T20:59:15,TorqueEmUp,Nice
07-07-2018T20:59:23,TorqueEmUp,Also Fluff was there
07-07-2018T20:59:39,TorqueEmUp,few rows down

07-07-2018T20:59:47,CrRAR,Rose bein' positive FTW
07-07-2018T20:59:55,CrRAR,still bittersweet tho
07-07-2018T20:59:58,Bgrmystr2,don't see any images of him and rei on the twitter feeds lol
07-07-2018T21:00:07,Bgrmystr2,would be nice
07-07-2018T21:00:26,TorqueEmUp,"Well they weren't with Katbox, they were a few rows away in their own little spot"
07-07-2018T21:00:37,Bgrmystr2,yeah
07-07-2018T21:00:46,Bgrmystr2,they too good :U
07-07-2018T21:00:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I like my elbow room too but yeesh
07-07-2018T21:01:18,qwe304,wonder when(if) hes gona post the con sketches
07-07-2018T21:01:19,TorqueEmUp,"I should have bought his Flora print, but I will wait till he does a picture of Natani."
07-07-2018T21:01:33,Bgrmystr2,"lol how do you mean, kiwi?"
07-07-2018T21:01:51,SpazztasticKiwi,They were separated. It’s just a kid
07-07-2018T21:01:57,qwe304,was the flora pring unique&gt;
07-07-2018T21:02:04,Bgrmystr2,ah
07-07-2018T21:02:04,qwe304,*print
07-07-2018T21:02:10,TorqueEmUp,"Which he said he has interest in doing. So If Fluff does a Natani pic, I will probably buy that immediatly the next time I see him at a con."
07-07-2018T21:03:26,TorqueEmUp,This was the Flora print he had. https://d.facdn.net/art/fluff-kevlar/1468010326/1468010011.fluff-kevlar_florapinupweb.jpg
07-07-2018T21:03:41,qwe304,ah i remember that one
07-07-2018T21:03:48,qwe304,its a nice peice
07-07-2018T21:03:53,Bgrmystr2,ah that one yeah
07-07-2018T21:03:53,TorqueEmUp,Aparently he gave Tom a big version of that print.
07-07-2018T21:04:03,TorqueEmUp,Not sure when
07-07-2018T21:04:11,CrRAR,xD
07-07-2018T21:04:14,Bgrmystr2,well yeah fluff gets super big prints of his work
07-07-2018T21:04:24,CrRAR,That's great.
07-07-2018T21:04:27,Bgrmystr2,you can get like huge 2x3 foot posters
07-07-2018T21:04:31,qwe304,fluff is the only one that ife seen that is able to draw toms characters without them looking totally weird (IMO)
07-07-2018T21:04:35,SpazztasticKiwi,He does good eyes
07-07-2018T21:04:46,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, they still seem slightly weird imo, qwe"
07-07-2018T21:04:51,Bgrmystr2,but it's a different artstyle
07-07-2018T21:04:53,Dadrobit,0.o I'm getting a 403 error on that link
07-07-2018T21:04:56,Bgrmystr2,so that's natural
07-07-2018T21:05:04,TorqueEmUp,I want to see him do Natani. lol
07-07-2018T21:05:13,CrRAR,he took some liberties with those stripes tho lol
07-07-2018T21:05:22,qwe304,"yeah, nobodys perfect, but fluf is the best ive seen in that aspect"
07-07-2018T21:05:34,Dadrobit,Anyone mind throwing me an imgur of that link?
07-07-2018T21:05:51,Bgrmystr2,"imgur doesn't play well with me, so prolly someone else"
07-07-2018T21:05:56,Bgrmystr2,it should be on his furaffinity though
07-07-2018T21:06:07,qwe304,https://imgur.com/a/1ITMpAQ here dad
07-07-2018T21:06:24,Dadrobit,Thank you kindlt
07-07-2018T21:06:26,CrRAR,good man qwe
07-07-2018T21:06:27,Dadrobit,kindly*
07-07-2018T21:06:49,qwe304,imgur is the first thing that pops up when i press I into search bar
07-07-2018T21:06:57,Bgrmystr2,dunno why you're getting 403 errors dadro
07-07-2018T21:07:01,Dadrobit,That's an older piece from FK no?
07-07-2018T21:07:05,qwe304,yes
07-07-2018T21:07:09,qwe304,not new
07-07-2018T21:07:17,qwe304,unsure how old exactally tho
07-07-2018T21:07:17,Bgrmystr2,it's not new but I wouldn't called it 'old'
07-07-2018T21:07:19,Dadrobit,"Me neither, tried opening it 3 times."
07-07-2018T21:07:47,qwe304,"dang, google can recognise flora"
07-07-2018T21:08:05,qwe304,i did a reverse search to find the original piece and google knew what it was
07-07-2018T21:08:15,CrRAR,Google is tk fan \o/
07-07-2018T21:08:33,Bgrmystr2,http://fkevlar.tumblr.com/post/147249075569
07-07-2018T21:08:38,Bgrmystr2,that's the flora image
07-07-2018T21:08:41,Bgrmystr2,he posted it a year ago
07-07-2018T21:08:41,CrRAR,that is pretty wild though
07-07-2018T21:08:46,Bgrmystr2,so it's not quite old
07-07-2018T21:08:49,qwe304,tom needs more merch
07-07-2018T21:09:02,Bgrmystr2,since he usually posts those pretty quickly after he does them
07-07-2018T21:11:50,Dadrobit,"Found his FA, posted 2 years ago."
07-07-2018T21:13:38,Dadrobit,Is there a way to view adult content on Tumblr without an account
07-07-2018T21:13:39,Dadrobit,?
07-07-2018T21:13:45,Bgrmystr2,"dunno, prolly not"
07-07-2018T21:13:54,Bgrmystr2,tumblr's pretty prude about non-account ppl
07-07-2018T21:14:00,Dadrobit,Then it shall forever be a mystery
07-07-2018T21:14:17,Bgrmystr2,"why, what are you trying to find out..?"
07-07-2018T21:14:31,Dadrobit,Fluff's Tumblr
07-07-2018T21:15:05,Bgrmystr2,"yeah I mean, what about it? If he has adult works on it?"
07-07-2018T21:15:18,Bgrmystr2,"cuz he does, and I can see them"
07-07-2018T21:15:29,Dadrobit,"Just saying, whatever is there, is beyond my reach"
07-07-2018T21:15:42,Bgrmystr2,"well, it's not like making an acct is hard :u"
07-07-2018T21:16:13,Dadrobit,It's more of a moral issue.

07-07-2018T21:16:44,Bgrmystr2,it's not like I use it for anything besides getting artwork beind their prudewall.
07-07-2018T21:16:51,Bgrmystr2,I don't pay anything so it's not a big deal
07-07-2018T21:17:09,CrRAR,lol @ prudewall
07-07-2018T21:17:19,Bgrmystr2,that's literally what it is
07-07-2018T21:17:27,Bgrmystr2,xD
07-07-2018T21:17:35,CrRAR,I wonder how long before we'll hear that's been added to a dictionary as an official word.
07-07-2018T21:17:52,CrRAR,tru tru
07-07-2018T21:18:02,Bgrmystr2,It's both an easy and acceptable way to hide adult content from the front face of the site.
07-07-2018T21:18:20,Bgrmystr2,not that other websites know this is possible..
07-07-2018T21:18:21,TorqueEmUp,"Indeed, Tom does need more merch"
07-07-2018T21:18:30,Bgrmystr2,yeh agree w/ that one Torque
07-07-2018T21:18:36,CrRAR,When they talked about building a wall... who knew it'd ever be of the prude variety. xD
07-07-2018T21:18:42,Bgrmystr2,xD
07-07-2018T21:18:48,TorqueEmUp,"When stand near his booth looking at others I did hear quite a few ""Ooo TwoKinds!"""
07-07-2018T21:18:57,CrRAR,lol
07-07-2018T21:19:08,TorqueEmUp,looking at other booths I mean
07-07-2018T21:19:33,CrRAR,yeah he was kinda sandwich'd in there.
07-07-2018T21:20:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"My con method: if you’re lost, just walk around. You’re bound to run into em eventually"
07-07-2018T21:21:10,CrRAR,"mmm, the random perusal method."
07-07-2018T21:21:26,TorqueEmUp,Tom was in a very easily found spot.
07-07-2018T21:21:30,TorqueEmUp,against a wall
07-07-2018T21:21:41,CrRAR,haha
07-07-2018T21:21:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Just look for the guy with a TK shirt
07-07-2018T21:21:54,CrRAR,clever
07-07-2018T21:22:01,TorqueEmUp,it could have only been easier if he wasn't sandwiched in.
07-07-2018T21:22:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"Not hard, but you better believe I’m the one that’s miss him"
07-07-2018T21:22:16,SpazztasticKiwi,*that’ll
07-07-2018T21:22:36,Bgrmystr2,"you aren't the only one, kiwi. I know a few others like that too"
07-07-2018T21:22:51,TorqueEmUp,Yeah I missed Fluff until like my second walkthrough of the Dealer Den
07-07-2018T21:23:14,TorqueEmUp,"Then I was like, hey I recognize the art style, then noticed the name. :P"
07-07-2018T21:23:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I wear the shirt of the person I’m there to see if I can
07-07-2018T21:23:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"That way, they may help me find them by saying “hey nice shirt”"
07-07-2018T21:23:54,TorqueEmUp,heh

07-07-2018T21:24:33,TorqueEmUp,"I said that once to someone at the con, wasn't Twokinds or Furry related though. lol"
07-07-2018T21:24:49,TorqueEmUp,Someone had a Eurobeat Intensifies t-shirt

07-07-2018T21:25:58,Bgrmystr2,did it also have a car drifting?
07-07-2018T21:26:07,Bgrmystr2,It better.
07-07-2018T21:26:12,Bgrmystr2,&gt;:T
07-07-2018T21:26:34,TorqueEmUp,Yup
07-07-2018T21:26:45,TorqueEmUp,Had the 86 drifting
07-07-2018T21:27:00,Bgrmystr2,Good
07-07-2018T21:27:04,InsertNameHere9140,Good
07-07-2018T21:27:11,Bgrmystr2,the way it should be. :ok_hand:
07-07-2018T21:27:43,TorqueEmUp,Indeed
07-07-2018T21:27:53,TorqueEmUp,brb gonna get me some food.
07-07-2018T22:17:37,TorqueEmUp,back
07-07-2018T22:17:43,Bgrmystr2,wb
07-07-2018T22:18:23,TorqueEmUp,"and yeah, I forgot to answer about the bookmark. Yeah it was the one where it looks Flora got laminated."
07-07-2018T22:26:04,CrRAR,"Oh cool, those are special printed on transparent plastic right?"
07-07-2018T22:26:59,TorqueEmUp,nah
07-07-2018T22:27:05,TorqueEmUp,well
07-07-2018T22:27:27,TorqueEmUp,the bookmark itself isn't plastic
07-07-2018T22:27:58,TorqueEmUp,but the part with flora is almost plastic like.
07-07-2018T22:28:09,CrRAR,Isee.
07-07-2018T22:28:18,TorqueEmUp,like extremely thin
07-07-2018T22:28:33,CrRAR,Traditional cardboard more like?
07-07-2018T22:28:42,TorqueEmUp,yeah
07-07-2018T22:28:50,CrRAR,I just remember Tom doing the art and focusing specifically on making sure the outlines 100% matched up.
07-07-2018T22:28:51,TorqueEmUp,with Flora looking glossy
07-07-2018T22:29:13,CrRAR,"Oh yeah, like the Art Book?"
07-07-2018T22:29:25,TorqueEmUp,"but everything around flora is matte, and is a different texture."
07-07-2018T22:29:34,TorqueEmUp,His prints are the same way
07-07-2018T22:30:33,CrRAR,"Mmm, that effect is georgeous. Works so well to up the feel of his printed stuff."
07-07-2018T22:30:36,TorqueEmUp,I am piss poor at describing stuff. lol
07-07-2018T22:30:51,CrRAR,lol
07-07-2018T22:32:06,TorqueEmUp,"but yeah, it's actually more like Flora was printed on a thin vinyl and placed on the cardboard."
07-07-2018T22:32:31,TorqueEmUp,same with the prints of each character
07-07-2018T22:32:58,TorqueEmUp,It looks really good in person
07-07-2018T22:33:30,CrRAR,"Yeah, like a raised glossy layer?"
07-07-2018T22:33:41,TorqueEmUp,yup
07-07-2018T22:33:51,TorqueEmUp,very slightly
07-07-2018T22:37:36,CrRAR,niiiice
07-07-2018T22:38:27,TorqueEmUp,Sometime going to get frames for the prints.
07-07-2018T22:39:24,CrRAR,Yeah I gotta do that at some point for the one's I've collected over the years.
07-07-2018T22:40:16,TorqueEmUp,at least get some cheapo walmart frames just so I can start decorting my plain white walls of this apartment. lol
07-07-2018T22:40:24,TorqueEmUp,decorating*
07-07-2018T22:41:30,CrRAR,I would just make sure to get something uv protective to shield from fading.
07-07-2018T22:41:44,CrRAR,"One piece of future merch that would be awesome to see is, when most/all books are released is like a slip-box for them to fit in. lol"
07-07-2018T22:41:50,TorqueEmUp,"Also, unless Tom is going to re-print the books, or use price stickers, he can't exactly jack up the prices at cones. the book prices are print right on the back in big text."
07-07-2018T22:42:06,TorqueEmUp,at cons*
07-07-2018T22:42:07,CrRAR,true
07-07-2018T22:42:24,TorqueEmUp,at least on the Paperbacks they are
07-07-2018T22:42:36,TorqueEmUp,and $15 for a book is already pretty high by book standards.
07-07-2018T22:42:59,TorqueEmUp,"at least of these sizes, granted they are all really well full color pages."
07-07-2018T22:43:09,TorqueEmUp,well done*
07-07-2018T22:44:08,CrRAR,Yeah I just checked on the Art Book the price is printed as well.
07-07-2018T22:45:07,TorqueEmUp,slapping higher price stickers over existing prices probably wouldn't go over to well with people.
07-07-2018T22:46:13,CrRAR,"Haha, yeah plus Tom went through the effort of having it put on there to avoid destructive stickers."
07-07-2018T22:46:27,CrRAR,:nauseated_face:
07-07-2018T22:46:30,TorqueEmUp,Indeed
07-07-2018T22:47:26,TorqueEmUp,I'll probably buy the hardbacks at some point or another. Because I am so afraid to damage the paperbacks
07-07-2018T22:47:41,TorqueEmUp,But I still wanted them anyway. lol
07-07-2018T22:48:24,CrRAR,I still baby the hardbacks though xD
07-07-2018T22:49:01,Dadrobit,"Okay, I'm gonna head out for a bit."
07-07-2018T22:49:18,CrRAR,Seeya robit!
07-07-2018T22:49:21,Dadrobit,Convinced my bro to help me make a bunch of noise and break a bunch of laws.
07-07-2018T22:49:39,Dadrobit,"So, I'll probably be back in a few hours :)"
07-07-2018T22:49:45,CrRAR,Hahaha
07-07-2018T22:49:52,CrRAR,Godspeed
07-07-2018T22:49:58,CrRAR,o7
07-07-2018T22:50:01,Dadrobit,"But for now, there is Science to be done!"
07-07-2018T22:50:03,Dadrobit,o7
07-07-2018T22:50:46,CrRAR,Does the noise part involve fireworks?
07-07-2018T22:51:27,CrRAR,:thinking:
07-07-2018T22:51:45,Dadrobit,"Nah, when my bro gets here, we're gonna sneak off into the nearby-ish mountains with my hand recorder and a foghorn."
07-07-2018T22:52:20,Dadrobit,I want to get a real good recording of natural reverb on a distant horn.
07-07-2018T22:52:50,Dadrobit,"Buuuut, that's not the most legal thing to do on state property near midnight."
07-07-2018T22:53:37,Dadrobit,http://i.imgur.com/eoTyU6Z.jpg
07-07-2018T22:54:05,Dadrobit,"He's gonna stand at one end of this canyon, and I'm going to stand at the other recording the horn as he blasts it a few time."
07-07-2018T22:54:19,Dadrobit,Then we're gonna make like a tree and get the fuck out.
07-07-2018T23:28:01,Dadrobit,"Bro's here, heading out, cya'll later."
07-07-2018T23:42:44,Bgrmystr2,is this the point where I call Nevada and say there's hooligins afoot? :ptv-wondering::ptv-snicker:
