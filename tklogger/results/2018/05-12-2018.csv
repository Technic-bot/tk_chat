05-12-2018T02:24:27,Dadrobit,It's just not as ~aesthetic~ as I'd like it to be.
05-12-2018T03:12:39,DarthRexKing,Goodnight everyone! o3o

05-12-2018T10:01:27,CrimsonQuill,Sleep well?
05-12-2018T10:03:14,Twokinds,Yes reasonably well
05-12-2018T10:03:26,CrimsonQuill,"Like a wolf then, heh."
05-12-2018T10:03:55,CrimsonQuill,Had to make the allusion-re-read 'Renunions' last night.
05-12-2018T10:13:49,CrimsonQuill,See anything interesting today?

05-12-2018T11:27:41,Mippy,So hungry :ctwokinds-sadtrace2:
05-12-2018T11:28:16,Xexanoth,then eat?
05-12-2018T11:28:28,CrimsonQuill,Cheubreki and soup
05-12-2018T11:28:39,Mippy,Can‚Äôt....forgot my wallet at home
05-12-2018T11:31:00,Mippy,Though my paper now clocks in at 8 pages and nearly 2000 words :ctwokinds-lynnsmile:
05-12-2018T11:31:46,CrimsonQuill,What paper/
05-12-2018T11:31:56,Mippy,My art history paper
05-12-2018T11:32:01,CrimsonQuill,Woah.
05-12-2018T11:32:19,CrimsonQuill,I remember for secondary school exams I had a 2000 word History essay.
05-12-2018T11:32:37,CrimsonQuill,I wrote about the battle of Traflager. Seemed an interesting subject.
05-12-2018T11:33:14,Mippy,Just hope I don‚Äôt end up looking like an overachiever. He only wanted 1500 words.
05-12-2018T11:33:55,CrimsonQuill,"Hah, at least you can write that much. Most of my stuff I type-my handwriting is generally poor, and my hand aches after only a page or so of writing."
05-12-2018T11:34:13,Mippy,Traflager...I probably know something about that...my food staved mind can‚Äôt think
05-12-2018T11:34:45,CrimsonQuill,1805 Battle in the Napoleonic Wars between the Royal Navy and the combined French-Spanish fleet.
05-12-2018T11:34:57,CrimsonQuill,"Off the cape of Traf-Al-Gar in Spain, hence the name."
05-12-2018T11:35:31,CrimsonQuill,Most people remember it as the battle where Vice admiral Lord Nelson was shot and asked for a kiss.
05-12-2018T11:35:43,Mippy,ohhhh that...hehe...I was thinking about China
05-12-2018T11:36:05,CrimsonQuill,Which chinese battle then? I don't know much about that.
05-12-2018T11:37:11,Mippy,Somehow I associate Trafalger Square with China....I have no idea why
05-12-2018T11:37:54,CrimsonQuill,"Neither do I, given that Trafalgar Square's in london and China is... a long way away."
05-12-2018T11:38:44,Mippy,Every time someone is like ‚ÄúWhere is Trafalger Square?‚Äù I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúChina‚Äù
05-12-2018T11:39:06,CrimsonQuill,One of my sisters has been there.
05-12-2018T11:39:13,CrimsonQuill,She sat on the back of one of the lions.
05-12-2018T11:39:36,CrimsonQuill,I'd like to go to London to see the Natural History Museum-the Blue Whale skeleton and the Triceratops.
05-12-2018T11:39:43,CrimsonQuill,And Dippy the Diplodocus.
05-12-2018T11:39:44,Mippy,"Cool, closet London I‚Äôve been too is Ontario"
05-12-2018T11:40:01,CrimsonQuill,"I'm a little closer, but still not close enough to go any time soon."
05-12-2018T11:41:09,Mippy,Poo...I want to go to London. Want to take one of those Jack the Ripper tours
05-12-2018T11:41:28,CrimsonQuill,"I'd just visit the places I want to, then leave."
05-12-2018T11:41:38,CrimsonQuill,I'm not the most comfortable around cities...
05-12-2018T11:41:45,CrimsonQuill,"Too noisy, too smelly..."
05-12-2018T11:41:51,CrimsonQuill,Can't stargaze...
05-12-2018T11:41:52,Mippy,I‚Äôm a big Ripper fan
05-12-2018T11:42:10,Mippy,Cities always leave me sort of awestruck
05-12-2018T11:42:10,CrimsonQuill,Meh. More St Paul's Cathedral for me.
05-12-2018T11:42:15,CrimsonQuill,Christopher Wren.
05-12-2018T11:42:23,CrimsonQuill,Magnificent architecture.
05-12-2018T11:43:29,Mippy,St Paul is definitely on the ‚Äúsee‚Äù list
05-12-2018T11:44:21,Mippy,I‚Äôd need to find a good local place to eat at. No America chains for me when abroad
05-12-2018T11:44:58,Mippy,Get myself some good British tuck
05-12-2018T11:45:03,CrimsonQuill,I'd go to  America to visit SDCC and meet Tom...or go to Canada.
05-12-2018T11:45:14,CrimsonQuill,"As for food, well, hehe..."
05-12-2018T11:45:34,CrimsonQuill,I don't really bother with 'national meals'. I just eat what fills me up or tastes good.
05-12-2018T11:45:53,CrimsonQuill,I spent Monday afternoon making a slavic dish from a youtube tutorial.
05-12-2018T11:46:08,CrimsonQuill,And one of my all time favourite foodes is bacon and cabbage.
05-12-2018T11:47:09,Mippy,XD I just like to eat what the locals eat. You think I eat Burger King when I‚Äôm home in the east? Nope...pop down to Paddy‚Äôs Pub instead
05-12-2018T11:47:19,CrimsonQuill,"Well done, Mippy, you've got me on to food again. God grief, I'm hungry."
05-12-2018T11:47:30,Mippy,So am I
05-12-2018T11:47:53,CrimsonQuill,"goof, not God. Why is it that I always make the same spelling and grammar mistakes in these?"
05-12-2018T11:47:58,CrimsonQuill,GOOD!
05-12-2018T11:48:10,CrimsonQuill,Good! Not Goof.
05-12-2018T11:48:13,CrimsonQuill,Arrgh..

05-12-2018T13:20:03,CrimsonQuill,Fair enough.

05-12-2018T15:02:56,CrimsonQuill,"OH CRUMBS, TOM, YOU DID BOTH VERSIONS!"
05-12-2018T15:03:47,CrimsonQuill,THANK YOU!
05-12-2018T15:04:46,Twokinds,You're welcome!
05-12-2018T15:05:09,CrimsonQuill,She looks absolutely brilliant-a true Spartan-IV!
05-12-2018T15:05:38,CrimsonQuill,I really like how you tinted Red's hair and face.
05-12-2018T15:05:43,CrimsonQuill,Nice touch.
05-12-2018T15:08:02,LeShpeee,But it is sad that the resolution of 2 picture is 2 times less
05-12-2018T15:09:13,CrimsonQuill,We can't win them all.
05-12-2018T15:09:41,LeShpeee,but versions without text are both the same size
05-12-2018T15:09:48,CrimsonQuill,"Besides, the no-text picture is full resolution."
05-12-2018T15:10:08,CrimsonQuill,"To be honest, when this was being sketched, I could hardly believe it."
05-12-2018T15:10:24,CrimsonQuill,"When this was voted for colouring, I nearly freaked out with joy."
05-12-2018T15:10:25,Twokinds,"Ah, that would be Patreon's fault. Seems they lower the res when embedding an image into the comments."
05-12-2018T15:10:32,Twokinds,"Er, description"
05-12-2018T15:10:38,CrimsonQuill,It's alright Tom.
05-12-2018T15:10:39,Twokinds,But the attached versions are big
05-12-2018T15:15:33,CrimsonQuill,I have them all.
05-12-2018T15:15:49,CrimsonQuill,How long did it take you to colour these?
05-12-2018T15:20:00,Twokinds,I'm not sure.
05-12-2018T15:20:09,CrimsonQuill,Hmmm.
05-12-2018T15:20:14,Twokinds,I did it on the stream.
05-12-2018T15:20:16,CrimsonQuill,"Actually, have YOU ever played Halo?"
05-12-2018T15:20:19,Twokinds,Took like 2 hours?
05-12-2018T15:20:27,CrimsonQuill,TWO HOURS.
05-12-2018T15:20:46,CrimsonQuill,"Man, I need to up the patience if I ever want to reach your standard of art."
05-12-2018T15:21:07,CrimsonQuill,"I mean, the longest I've spent on a drawing in one sitting is 35 minutes."
05-12-2018T15:22:15,CrimsonQuill,"Have you played Halo, or just heard of it?"
05-12-2018T15:23:34,Twokinds,What's a Halo?
05-12-2018T15:23:44,CrimsonQuill,Har har
05-12-2018T15:24:14,Twokinds,I'm a PC gamer. I played Halo 1 sometime in 2002 or 2003. And that was it.

05-12-2018T15:24:21,Twokinds,So it's been a while.
05-12-2018T15:24:29,CrimsonQuill,My first game was Halo 4.
05-12-2018T15:24:39,CrimsonQuill,I played it a year and a half ago.
05-12-2018T15:24:55,Twokinds,I THINK I played Halo 3 multiplayer back in the day.
05-12-2018T15:25:06,Twokinds,When I was at my friends house
05-12-2018T15:25:13,Twokinds,But I can't really emember. I know I played Halo 1 multi
05-12-2018T15:25:42,LeShpeee,"Tom, what game did you play the most hours?"
05-12-2018T15:25:43,CrimsonQuill,I sometimes play multiplayer split screen with my brother.
05-12-2018T15:25:47,CrimsonQuill,He loves it to bits.
05-12-2018T15:25:57,Twokinds,Uh...
05-12-2018T15:27:19,Twokinds,I don't know.
05-12-2018T15:27:31,Twokinds,I'm not really someone who obsesses over one game. And I never got into MMOs.
05-12-2018T15:27:40,Twokinds,So I don't have crazy thousands of hours in anything.
05-12-2018T15:27:52,LeShpeee,"but you have your favorite games, don't you?"
05-12-2018T15:28:17,Twokinds,Yeah.
05-12-2018T15:28:25,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I've played through Halo 4's campaign about 5-6 times."
05-12-2018T15:28:29,CrimsonQuill,Twice on Legendary.
05-12-2018T15:28:40,Twokinds,"According to Steam, the most hours in any one game was Skyrim, but that's not really accurate."
05-12-2018T15:28:55,Twokinds,New Vegas has a lot of hours that weren't counted. I'm sure I have more in that game.
05-12-2018T15:29:31,CrimsonQuill,You play Skyrim
05-12-2018T15:29:40,Twokinds,Morrowind I probably have a crazy amount of hours in over my lifetime.
05-12-2018T15:31:06,CrimsonQuill,I'm just starting Skyrim.
05-12-2018T15:31:12,Xexanoth,morrowind....man i don't even know how often i had to reset that one stupid Fast Travel NPC cause he would always fall down the bridge...
05-12-2018T15:31:34,Xexanoth,that's pretty much the only thing i still remember about the game XD
05-12-2018T15:31:58,CrimsonQuill,"My very first mission, I picked up too much to be able to run."
05-12-2018T15:32:32,Xexanoth,gotta learn what to pick up and what to leave
05-12-2018T15:32:44,Xexanoth,"generally if it weights more than it has gold worth, don't bother with it"
05-12-2018T15:33:05,Twokinds,You get pretty good at calculating weight / value
05-12-2018T15:33:37,CrimsonQuill,My strategy at the very start was 'pick up everything to sell'. Not the best I must admit.

05-12-2018T15:34:43,LeShpeee,but then I took everything that wasn't nailed to the floor
05-12-2018T15:34:56,CrimsonQuill,I want to get the Portal 2 SPace Core mod for Skyrim.
05-12-2018T15:35:10,LeShpeee,I think everyone did it the first time
05-12-2018T15:35:28,CrimsonQuill,Listen to this quote:
05-12-2018T15:36:01,CrimsonQuill,"'The Nac Mac Feegles will steal everything that isn't nailed down. If it is nailed down, they'll steal the nails as well.'"

05-12-2018T15:37:13,LeShpeee,I'm pretty sure Skyrim has a mod for this

05-12-2018T15:41:00,CrimsonQuill,It's hilarious.

05-12-2018T15:44:25,TerraTheWizard,"one of cicero's voice lines when he's following you, it's the end of a joke he tells"
05-12-2018T15:44:35,TerraTheWizard,'joke'

05-12-2018T15:47:57,TerraTheWizard,lol
05-12-2018T15:48:27,CrimsonQuill,@TerraTheWizard do you know about Halo?
05-12-2018T15:51:36,TerraTheWizard,nope
05-12-2018T15:51:51,CrimsonQuill,Ok
05-12-2018T15:52:02,TerraTheWizard,all my halo experience is 10 minutes of halo 1 on a store display shortly after it released
05-12-2018T15:52:07,TerraTheWizard,lol
05-12-2018T15:52:07,CrimsonQuill,Then I'm afraid that my suggestion might have confused you.
05-12-2018T15:52:39,CrimsonQuill,I only started a year and a half ago.
05-12-2018T15:53:11,CrimsonQuill,I bought Halo 4 and fell in love with it.
05-12-2018T15:59:07,CrimsonQuill,Anyone else play Halo?

05-12-2018T17:30:01,RimaDraws,like i said im glad i didn't do clovis scrooge otherwise i would be embarrassed again
05-12-2018T17:30:35,Mippy,Then come up with a non repetitive cliche...or you could suggest a sequel to an existing holiday piece
