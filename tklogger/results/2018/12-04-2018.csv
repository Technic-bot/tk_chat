12-04-2018T15:54:07,CrimsonFall,what is it
12-04-2018T15:55:50,Vatruvius,A blog post where you have to answer 6 questions on agriculture with research supporting your responses.
12-04-2018T15:57:25,CrimsonFall,"i could easily use my college database to answer them, but Im more of a math guy"
12-04-2018T15:57:40,CrimsonFall,gl thou
12-04-2018T15:57:42,CrimsonFall,^_^
12-04-2018T15:58:11,Vatruvius,I can use my college database too but it is not that type of research luckily...just valid research to support some of the points you make.
12-04-2018T16:01:14,CrimsonFall,researching is not my favorite thing......I preferred math and scince
12-04-2018T16:01:51,CrimsonFall,science* (this is what I mean)
12-04-2018T16:02:49,Bgrmystr2,"that's not exactly good for Vatru tho, cuz they should be doin that homework themselves. :P"
12-04-2018T16:03:27,Vatruvius,Who should be doing what homework themselves?
12-04-2018T16:04:27,Bgrmystr2,"See? If you did homework yourself, you'd see that ""Vatru"" was the subject of the sentence, meaning you. :P"
12-04-2018T16:04:53,Vatruvius,"Agh...the class lesson this week watching the Food, Inc. movie. I already watched this thing years ago...not to mention the worksheet that goes with it to make sure you watch it...agh!"
12-04-2018T16:05:42,Vatruvius,"I read ""they"" as plural...still getting used to that term being used to identify an individual."
12-04-2018T16:05:47,JamesBSquirrel3,"Hi, I'm new me. May I have question; What time on live-stream strats in UK Time from 9 PM of EST Time on? Do you or someone will know?:thinking:"
12-04-2018T16:06:44,Vatruvius,Google it...what time is it in EST and it should pop you. You can do the math from there.
12-04-2018T16:06:53,Vatruvius,up* not you
12-04-2018T16:07:39,Bgrmystr2,"I'm not in UK, but you can just find out by lookin it up."
12-04-2018T16:07:41,CrimsonFall,good thing am in the Est time zone
12-04-2018T16:08:34,Vatruvius,So lookkng forwatd to eatchinh this depresding movie again! :ptv-excited::ptv-unimpressed:
12-04-2018T16:09:09,Vatruvius,Ignore my phone's autocorrect please...*facepalm*
12-04-2018T16:09:55,Bgrmystr2,I can't ignore it if you keep it on :P
12-04-2018T16:11:17,Vatruvius,Not sure how to turn it off...
12-04-2018T16:40:55,DRAGONTANOPUG,Im really surprised there was no week stream
12-04-2018T16:41:07,DRAGONTANOPUG,But i missed a lot if the sunday sketch one
12-04-2018T16:41:57,Bgrmystr2,"it happens, tom was probably busy"
12-04-2018T16:45:20,DRAGONTANOPUG,What was the last 4 sketchs om sunday
12-04-2018T16:47:53,Bgrmystr2,tom already posted em on patreon bro
12-04-2018T16:48:02,Bgrmystr2,"all the sketches, or most of em"
12-04-2018T16:48:24,DRAGONTANOPUG,Oh right
12-04-2018T17:13:39,Vatruvius,I hate this class...:ptv-angry:
12-04-2018T17:17:13,DRAGONTANOPUG,What vlass
12-04-2018T17:17:19,DRAGONTANOPUG,Lol vlass
12-04-2018T17:19:06,Vatruvius,Got it wrong twice. class*
12-04-2018T17:19:43,Vatruvius,My environmental studies class...every week it just makes me more mad at the system and multinational corporations.
12-04-2018T17:29:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder - since Tom‚Äôs been off for the past few days - if his internet is out or being fuzzy
12-04-2018T17:29:40,Vatruvius,Oh god...one of my least favorite scenes in the entire film...just fotmd a pit in my stomach. :ptv-confused:
12-04-2018T17:29:57,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs been some pop up storms and weird weather
12-04-2018T17:30:10,Vatruvius,That is a possibility Kiwi...also hello! :ptv-greetings:
12-04-2018T17:30:53,SpazztasticKiwi,üòãüôåüèª
12-04-2018T17:32:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, I went into town today and saw a guys who‚Äôs truck‚Äôs exhaust pipe sounded like two pieces of metal clacking together"
12-04-2018T17:32:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Not sure if it meant he needed a mechanic or if it was cosmetic
12-04-2018T17:33:19,Vatruvius,Probably both. :ptv-laugh:
12-04-2018T17:35:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also had another guy pull up next to me in a McDonald‚Äôs exit. Could not see past him, his truck was so high. And I was in an SUV myself"
12-04-2018T17:36:25,Vatruvius,I honestly need to hear more happy things...this movie is just going to give me five heart attacks.
12-04-2018T17:37:22,SpazztasticKiwi,How bout this then: the dude in the big truck looked barely tall enough to be over the steering wheel
12-04-2018T17:38:20,Vatruvius,Hahaha...:ptv-ohmy::ptv-laugh:
12-04-2018T17:38:25,SpazztasticKiwi,He was still stretching to look both ways despite being several feet off the ground already
12-04-2018T17:39:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"It was a pretty truck though, I admit. Just don‚Äôt feel that the guy in it was ready for something so huge"
12-04-2018T17:40:10,Vatruvius,One would say he is compensating for something.
12-04-2018T17:41:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"Seeing as though he looked at the most, in order to make him legal to drive anyway, 16, I‚Äôd say so"
12-04-2018T17:42:26,Vatruvius,Hmm...:ptv-wondering:
12-04-2018T17:42:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I know a kid about to graduate that has a taller than necessary truck that he‚Äôs had since I left high school (he was a freshman at the time)
12-04-2018T17:43:31,Vatruvius,Yeah...something going on there.
12-04-2018T17:43:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôve noticed that thing get ever so slightly taller over those years. And the rims look different too
12-04-2018T17:44:10,Vatruvius,lol
12-04-2018T17:44:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I know someone who‚Äôs lift kit backfired on them though
12-04-2018T17:44:54,Vatruvius,How did that go?
12-04-2018T17:45:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"They hit a pot hole hard, causing their truck to lose control and go into a ditch. The lifted tires went sideways mid-crash and caused a roll over"
12-04-2018T17:46:16,Vatruvius,Hahaha...that'll teach ya to modify your car way more than is necessary.
12-04-2018T17:47:04,DRAGONTANOPUG,Ya boi got a new sourround sound system and broke it after blasting it
12-04-2018T17:47:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"The truck was basically totaled, though it was just crushed in places, and the tires were obviously screwed"
12-04-2018T17:48:10,Vatruvius,Wow...
12-04-2018T17:48:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"The people were pretty much ok because the truck‚Äôs frame gave, but didn‚Äôt break. Steel I think"
12-04-2018T17:49:44,Vatruvius,Yeah...
12-04-2018T17:51:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"Unfortunately I do know someone who‚Äôs truck failed them. 5 months after we graduated, and 1 month after his 19th birthday, a guy from my class fell asleep at the wheel"
12-04-2018T17:51:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Hit a tree going 70
12-04-2018T17:51:56,Vatruvius,Wow...did he survive?
12-04-2018T17:52:26,SpazztasticKiwi,The tree landed on the driver‚Äôs side and crushed him
12-04-2018T17:52:46,Vatruvius,The tree fell over?
12-04-2018T17:52:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Yep
12-04-2018T17:54:14,Vatruvius,Did he make it okay?
12-04-2018T17:54:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"Closed casket funeral. I don‚Äôt know if it killed him instantly, but I hope it did. The crash is estimated at about 2 a.m., and he was found later"
12-04-2018T17:55:07,Vatruvius,Man...sorry to hear that.
12-04-2018T17:56:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn‚Äôt know him well at all. His mother was one of my nurses from when I was younger
12-04-2018T17:56:54,Vatruvius,I got in a wreck once...abot two years ago on an interstate in the fast lane. All the traffic was stopped and I was rounding a turn over a hill. I had enough time to slow down to 35. Ended up hitting 3 cars...no injuries. Scarest moment of my life...took
12-04-2018T17:57:06,Vatruvius,about a year to get over it.
12-04-2018T17:57:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"But no one expected me to show at the funeral. They seemed surprised I showed. And the thing is, it was because he was a really nice guy. I may not have ever made friends with him, but I could have a decent conversation with him"
12-04-2018T17:59:14,Vatruvius,"Someone in my middleschool, Hayden...got in a hunting accident. Tripped and fell on his rifle...he didn't make it. He was also alone most of the time...he transfered so he had no friends and everyone was alreafy established."
12-04-2018T17:59:39,SpazztasticKiwi,The friends there (mostly other classmates - he was in sports) evidently thought closer people would show and not much else
12-04-2018T18:00:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Also 35 is probably why no one got hurt
12-04-2018T18:00:57,Vatruvius,"At his funeral the entire 6th, 7th, and 8th grade went to his funeral save for a few people including myself. I wantef to go but my parents said no...I guess I wanted to go because I felt guilty not tryibg to be friends with him. It was a low point on the"
12-04-2018T18:01:30,Vatruvius,entire school. We even held a ceromony and planted a school tree in his name.
12-04-2018T18:01:36,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs death that unites us most often
12-04-2018T18:01:41,Bgrmystr2,"You've got some heartless parents, Vatru"
12-04-2018T18:01:43,Bgrmystr2,I'll say that
12-04-2018T18:01:58,tehbear,i just joined. read a bit of chat and was about to say the same
12-04-2018T18:02:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"After our classmate‚Äôs death, everyone was immediately nicer to each other"
12-04-2018T18:02:46,Vatruvius,They were not heartless...my mom lead the ceremony for him. I guess they saved me the experience of a funeral at 12...not to mention I never said hello to him.
12-04-2018T18:03:49,Vatruvius,What was I going to say...sorry for your loss. I was one of the kids that didn't help your child settle into the school?
12-04-2018T18:04:45,tehbear,you cant think like that... and yet we all do.
12-04-2018T18:04:58,Bgrmystr2,your mom lead the funeral ceremony where three ENTIRE school grades attended
12-04-2018T18:05:01,Bgrmystr2,and didn't let you go
12-04-2018T18:05:04,Bgrmystr2,yeah I stand by my statement.
12-04-2018T18:05:31,Vatruvius,No...my mom lead the school ceremony were we planted a tree in his name.
12-04-2018T18:05:56,Bgrmystr2,still
12-04-2018T18:06:27,Bgrmystr2,it's not like the dude commited suicide. So it's not really relevant whether you would have changed what happened if you were his friend or not
12-04-2018T18:07:13,Bgrmystr2,It ain't your fault
12-04-2018T18:07:31,Bgrmystr2,so there's no reason for you to feel guilty of anything
12-04-2018T18:08:55,Vatruvius,I don't feel guilty...I am just reasoning why my younger self wanted to go. It was either because I felt guilty or because everyone else was going.
12-04-2018T18:09:21,Bgrmystr2,Out of respect
12-04-2018T18:09:27,Bgrmystr2,I would have gone.
12-04-2018T18:09:34,Bgrmystr2,even not knowing the guy
12-04-2018T18:11:16,Vatruvius,That may have been another reason. It was so long ago and the person I was then to the person I am now that I have no clue what the reason was. Had it been in highschool...it would be out of respect...even if I hated the guy.
12-04-2018T18:11:32,Bgrmystr2,"I've gone to several funerals of kids that I didn't know, but attended school with"
12-04-2018T18:11:50,Bgrmystr2,"not even people in class, but just.. kids from the school.."
12-04-2018T18:12:00,Bgrmystr2,shit happened. it was sad
12-04-2018T18:12:53,SpazztasticKiwi,There was a guy I knew from pre school. He‚Äôd moved but appeared in the news because he was missing
12-04-2018T18:13:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"He was found later in some wooded area, shot in the back"
12-04-2018T18:14:28,Vatruvius,Who would shoot a pre-schooler?
12-04-2018T18:14:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"It was years later, I just knew him from pre school"
12-04-2018T18:15:43,Vatruvius,Ohh...still.
12-04-2018T18:18:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Three people were arrested - two were officially charged and jailed. It was suspected they lured him to the woods to kill him because he was gay
12-04-2018T18:18:41,Vatruvius,Wow...
12-04-2018T18:18:59,Vatruvius,Cowards...the lot of em.
12-04-2018T18:19:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt remember if that motive was determined as the official one or if they found another
12-04-2018T18:20:01,SpazztasticKiwi,But that‚Äôs what‚Äôs suspected to have been the reason and how it happened
12-04-2018T18:20:06,DRAGONTANOPUG,Toms on!
12-04-2018T18:20:24,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, that's not unusual, Dragon"
12-04-2018T18:20:28,DRAGONTANOPUG,I now
12-04-2018T18:20:31,DRAGONTANOPUG,Know
12-04-2018T18:20:37,SpazztasticKiwi,TOM!!
12-04-2018T18:20:41,DRAGONTANOPUG,Lol
12-04-2018T18:21:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Starting to think your internet had given you the middle finger
12-04-2018T18:21:00,Bgrmystr2,But I guess it's time to act like it's unusual or somethin :thinking:
12-04-2018T18:21:09,Vatruvius,Hey Tom...you have been off for a ehile there. :ptv-greetings:
12-04-2018T18:21:26,Vatruvius,while*
12-04-2018T18:23:09,DRAGONTANOPUG,Btw go too https://discordapp.com/invite/7AdUJJV
12-04-2018T18:23:53,Vatruvius,What is this?
12-04-2018T18:24:36,Bgrmystr2,"it's a discord chat room invite, but I don't know for what reason we should go. :thinking:"
12-04-2018T18:25:01,DRAGONTANOPUG,Heh
12-04-2018T18:25:11,DRAGONTANOPUG,Just got excited
12-04-2018T18:25:55,Vatruvius,I know it is an invite...wondering for which Discord chat room.
12-04-2018T18:36:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Not sure if Tom‚Äôs being weird or just unusual
12-04-2018T18:37:17,Vatruvius,What do you mean? :ptv-wondering:
12-04-2018T18:37:52,SpazztasticKiwi,He‚Äôs been quiet for days and just popped in for a few seconds without any comment
12-04-2018T18:38:32,Vatruvius,I do not know...
12-04-2018T18:38:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"Not sure if that‚Äôs just him, albeit a bit strange of him, or if something‚Äôs wrong"
12-04-2018T18:39:34,Vatruvius,Yeah...maybe. He could also just be very busy...he is not required to update us.
12-04-2018T18:40:19,Bgrmystr2,That's just tom being tom
12-04-2018T18:40:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"Like I said, either he‚Äôs just being unusual or weirdly off"
12-04-2018T18:40:33,Bgrmystr2,you know he doesn't actually have to be here to see what's going on in chat
12-04-2018T18:40:40,Bgrmystr2,this is nothing unusual at all
12-04-2018T18:40:59,SpazztasticKiwi,A man of few words
12-04-2018T18:41:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"Like a monk. Or do all monks take a vow of silence - there‚Äôs some that still speak, right"
12-04-2018T18:42:23,Vatruvius,Well technically he is a man of many words considering all the text that is in his comic.
12-04-2018T18:42:31,Vatruvius,:ptv-tease:
12-04-2018T18:43:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"Well monks often talk a lot too then because many of them dedicate their lives to holy work, like translations scriptures and such"
12-04-2018T19:01:40,ItsActuallyKopyKat,So...anyone know when the next stream is?
12-04-2018T19:05:44,DRAGONTANOPUG,No
12-04-2018T19:07:05,Vatruvius,The scheduled stream is in less than an hour...but no word yet.
12-04-2018T19:07:31,Bgrmystr2,we don't need word right now
12-04-2018T19:07:35,Bgrmystr2,we still have an hour
12-04-2018T19:08:23,Bgrmystr2,"the schedule is always at the top of the chat, and friday is the longest running stream tom's had on here"
12-04-2018T19:09:16,Bgrmystr2,he'll prolly jump on around the time when the stream's about to start
12-04-2018T19:09:20,Bgrmystr2,as always
12-04-2018T19:16:06,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"okie doke, good enough"
12-04-2018T19:16:47,Nillalee113,when does the stream start? I'm always so confused about time zones
12-04-2018T19:17:02,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"It starts soon, probably"
12-04-2018T19:17:15,ItsActuallyKopyKat,The times are pretty flexible
12-04-2018T19:17:26,Bgrmystr2,"in about 45 mins, right now it's 9pm EDT"
12-04-2018T19:17:42,Bgrmystr2,since daylight savings is in effect atm
12-04-2018T19:17:47,Nillalee113,Yeah its like 6 for me
12-04-2018T19:17:58,ThingsAreMoving,o/
12-04-2018T19:18:17,Bgrmystr2,Fri streams are always 9pm eastern
12-04-2018T19:18:18,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Heya things
12-04-2018T19:18:20,Bgrmystr2,hey Things
12-04-2018T19:18:35,Nillalee113,"I'm excited. Today is a new panel, right?"
12-04-2018T19:18:43,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Should be, yeah"
12-04-2018T19:19:17,Bgrmystr2,today will probably be a new page.. probably
12-04-2018T19:19:23,Bgrmystr2,but we'll see when the stream starts
12-04-2018T19:19:46,ThingsAreMoving,"New page, new chapter, new possibilities"
12-04-2018T19:19:50,Nillalee113,That's cool. I just love watching him draw so honestly I'm alright with anything
12-04-2018T19:19:57,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Aye
12-04-2018T19:20:41,ThingsAreMoving,I wonder if some characters will be sent off behind the scenes semi-permanently
12-04-2018T19:20:49,ThingsAreMoving,seems like a logical thing to do
12-04-2018T19:20:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Just joined the discord from Instagram. Don‚Äôt know how much I‚Äôll use it yet
12-04-2018T19:21:23,Nillalee113,Was that link for an official chat or something?
12-04-2018T19:21:32,Bgrmystr2,No Nilla lol
12-04-2018T19:21:38,Bgrmystr2,there is no official discord chat
12-04-2018T19:21:42,Vatruvius,Semi-permanently is just temporary.

12-04-2018T19:21:49,ThingsAreMoving,"Can't go more official than here, lol"
12-04-2018T19:22:09,Bgrmystr2,there's two large fan-made discord chatrooms
12-04-2018T19:22:15,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"There's also the IRC, but it's pretty slow"
12-04-2018T19:22:20,Bgrmystr2,the only official chats are this one and the IRC
12-04-2018T19:22:24,ThingsAreMoving,are they in a state of war with eachother?
12-04-2018T19:22:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Just saw the post when I went to see who‚Äôs posted recent insta stories
12-04-2018T19:22:34,Nillalee113,Thats cool.
12-04-2018T19:22:55,Bgrmystr2,"lol things, debatably."
12-04-2018T19:22:56,Vatruvius,IRC?
12-04-2018T19:22:56,Nillalee113,I dunno usually i'll just check in here for chat
12-04-2018T19:23:07,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Internet Relay Chat, Vatru"
12-04-2018T19:23:08,ThingsAreMoving,"IRC, internet relay chat"
12-04-2018T19:23:15,ThingsAreMoving,thing of the 90's
12-04-2018T19:23:18,Vatruvius,Where is this?
12-04-2018T19:23:21,ItsActuallyKopyKat,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/chat/
12-04-2018T19:23:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Some of the people I follow make me want to bury myself
12-04-2018T19:23:33,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Bam bam bam, I'm on fire today"
12-04-2018T19:23:38,SpazztasticKiwi,They‚Äôre so pretty
12-04-2018T19:23:40,ThingsAreMoving,"why, kiwi"
12-04-2018T19:23:55,ThingsAreMoving,pretty is a pretty subjective thing
12-04-2018T19:24:05,Vatruvius,IT is subjective.
12-04-2018T19:24:09,Vatruvius,It*
12-04-2018T19:24:21,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"As in, the subjects, are pretty pretty lol"
12-04-2018T19:24:22,Vatruvius,Also...is the IRC really used like this one?
12-04-2018T19:24:29,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Eh...not really
12-04-2018T19:24:32,ThingsAreMoving,lolno
12-04-2018T19:24:45,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"I'ts more of a general discussion, with tendencies towards TK"
12-04-2018T19:25:05,Vatruvius,I see.
12-04-2018T19:25:26,Nillalee113,I would hope it had TK tendencies
12-04-2018T19:25:35,ThingsAreMoving,Over here it's usually TK with tendencies towards other things
12-04-2018T19:25:42,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Lol. It is a TK chat
12-04-2018T19:25:54,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Yes, Things"
12-04-2018T19:25:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I did see a tumblr ask from Ethan though: ‚Äúwould you ever date a fan?‚Äù
12-04-2018T19:26:12,Nillalee113,Omg did he answer it?
12-04-2018T19:26:45,Vatruvius,That would be very weird and I have a hard time seeing it work out well at all.
12-04-2018T19:26:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"He said maybe, within reason, which I‚Äôm pretty sure means ‚Äúif they know more about me than I do, probably not‚Äù"
12-04-2018T19:27:12,Vatruvius,lol...how to tell you are being stalked. They know more than you do.
12-04-2018T19:27:26,Bgrmystr2,haha
12-04-2018T19:27:27,Nillalee113,I  feel like it would get a little too into twokinds
12-04-2018T19:27:32,Nillalee113,everyone needs a break
12-04-2018T19:27:39,ThingsAreMoving,"it's called lore collecting, not stalking"
12-04-2018T19:27:45,Vatruvius,wow
12-04-2018T19:27:50,Bgrmystr2,"that's different, things"
12-04-2018T19:27:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm pretty sure anyone even well known/famous has been asked that question though
12-04-2018T19:27:59,Nillalee113,Is it lore if its about the creator and not the actual comic though?
12-04-2018T19:28:21,SpazztasticKiwi,You could argue technicalities with that angle
12-04-2018T19:28:24,Vatruvius,I would categorize that as not lore.
12-04-2018T19:28:44,Nillalee113,:point_right:
12-04-2018T19:28:56,ThingsAreMoving,meh
12-04-2018T19:29:43,Bgrmystr2,"lore requires it to be about the comic. People do not have ""lore"", people have ""history"""
12-04-2018T19:29:51,Bgrmystr2,lore is a story-specific word
12-04-2018T19:30:10,Vatruvius,^
12-04-2018T19:30:13,Nillalee113,makes sense.
12-04-2018T19:30:40,Flareuim,"Streams soon, he'd to look up est tme tho"
12-04-2018T19:30:41,Nillalee113,"partially off topic, what is the tumblr you were speaking of kiwi?"
12-04-2018T19:31:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"I follow Ethan, so when he answered the question, it showed on my feed"
12-04-2018T19:31:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Crankgameplays
12-04-2018T19:31:56,Vatruvius,*gasp*...you follow Ethan Kiwi...your are a stalker!
12-04-2018T19:32:03,Vatruvius,I have to call the authorities.
12-04-2018T19:32:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Hard to follow someone physically when they live literally across the country
12-04-2018T19:32:29,Vatruvius,"Ohh right...isn't his people the ""cranky crew"" or something?"
12-04-2018T19:32:30,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
12-04-2018T19:33:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Yea
12-04-2018T19:33:10,Nillalee113,Thats cool
12-04-2018T19:33:16,Vatruvius,Sorry...*smirks* I just cannot take there seriously.
12-04-2018T19:33:22,Vatruvius,that*
12-04-2018T19:33:23,ThingsAreMoving,how is it that almost everyone on the internet with some followers have to have a 'gang' or a name forr the people following them?
12-04-2018T19:33:32,ThingsAreMoving,for*
12-04-2018T19:33:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"It‚Äôs a community thing, I guess"

12-04-2018T19:34:57,ThingsAreMoving,poor wall
12-04-2018T19:35:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you like something, it‚Äôs an unsaid rule you have a community name to call yourselves"
12-04-2018T19:35:08,NightMeaty22,the walls fine
12-04-2018T19:35:13,Vatruvius,hahaha...don't care about Meaty...just the wall.
12-04-2018T19:35:22,Nillalee113,Do we have a name?
12-04-2018T19:35:31,ThingsAreMoving,I am ThingsAreMoving
12-04-2018T19:35:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Don‚Äôt think so
12-04-2018T19:35:50,NightMeaty22,no one care bout me hehe ‚òπ
12-04-2018T19:36:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Probably just ‚ÄúTwoKinds fans‚Äù or ‚ÄúTwoKinds community‚Äù
12-04-2018T19:36:07,ItsActuallyKopyKat,I do Meaty
12-04-2018T19:36:11,ItsActuallyKopyKat,I just got back
12-04-2018T19:36:12,ThingsAreMoving,"you nearly destroyed our wall, be happy we're not calling the insurance company"
12-04-2018T19:36:13,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Poor wall
12-04-2018T19:36:24,ItsActuallyKopyKat,never had a chance
12-04-2018T19:36:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Otherwise we just go by our chat names
12-04-2018T19:36:36,NightMeaty22,the walls fine my head not so much
12-04-2018T19:36:47,Nillalee113,Sounds good to me. I like just being a fan
12-04-2018T19:36:56,Bgrmystr2,"""Nearly destroyed"" The wall is fine. It's in pieces all over the room, but it's fine"
12-04-2018T19:37:02,ItsActuallyKopyKat,I am a big metal fan.
12-04-2018T19:37:10,Vatruvius,"I actually slipped from a pool of water in the hallway of my old house. I was around 12 and I was running...my knee went right into the corner of the wall and put a huge dent into the drywall, it hurt like hell."
12-04-2018T19:37:14,ThingsAreMoving,My spirit animal is an electric oven.
12-04-2018T19:37:15,Bgrmystr2,it'll duct tape together easily later.
12-04-2018T19:37:33,NightMeaty22,the wall is concret
12-04-2018T19:37:35,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Sometimes people sit near me and turn me on, so I cool them off. But one time someone tripped over my cord."
12-04-2018T19:37:42,ItsActuallyKopyKat,That wasn't fun
12-04-2018T19:37:53,Vatruvius,What?
12-04-2018T19:38:05,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"I am a big metal fan, Vatru"
12-04-2018T19:38:10,Vatruvius,lol
12-04-2018T19:38:18,ThingsAreMoving,people flip Kat's switch and turn him/her on
12-04-2018T19:38:26,NeonMitsumi,I heard Kat.
12-04-2018T19:38:26,ItsActuallyKopyKat,*Her
12-04-2018T19:38:32,ThingsAreMoving,thank you\
12-04-2018T19:38:34,Vatruvius,Kat is a her.
12-04-2018T19:38:40,ItsActuallyKopyKat,:D
12-04-2018T19:38:43,Vatruvius,Definitely a her.
12-04-2018T19:38:45,ThingsAreMoving,Now I know.
12-04-2018T19:38:54,NightMeaty22,üòê
12-04-2018T19:38:58,Nillalee113,note taken
12-04-2018T19:39:02,Vatruvius,If she was not a her...well...I do not want to think what that would make me.
12-04-2018T19:39:20,ThingsAreMoving,A pancake?
12-04-2018T19:39:25,SpazztasticKiwi,A unique specimen
12-04-2018T19:39:32,NightMeaty22,a wall
12-04-2018T19:39:36,Vatruvius,Let's go with those.
12-04-2018T19:39:40,Nillalee113,a mahogany cabinet?
12-04-2018T19:40:31,ThingsAreMoving,"I should go to bed, but It 's weekend and sleeping makes it shorter"
12-04-2018T19:40:57,Nillalee113,and there might be a stream tonight :)
12-04-2018T19:41:05,ThingsAreMoving,I know!
12-04-2018T19:41:28,ThingsAreMoving,I should only be here on sundays and keep my sleep schedule intact
12-04-2018T19:41:46,Nillalee113,Pfft sleep is for the weak
12-04-2018T19:42:09,ThingsAreMoving,we sleep 1/3rd of our life
12-04-2018T19:42:19,ThingsAreMoving,sleep is essential to our survival
12-04-2018T19:42:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Unfortunately
12-04-2018T19:42:43,Vatruvius,I just sleep into Saturday morning. :ptv-hearts: Though it probably helps that I live in California...stream starts at 6pm for me.
12-04-2018T19:42:44,ThingsAreMoving,unless you're spetznaz
12-04-2018T19:43:01,ThingsAreMoving,spetznaz guys sleep only 4hrs a day
12-04-2018T19:43:07,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Can't wait for the scientists to figure out why sleep is necessary...we literally spend about 1/3 of our lives hallucinating
12-04-2018T19:43:21,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"More if you actually hallucinate, too"
12-04-2018T19:43:26,Nillalee113,And its great.
12-04-2018T19:43:38,ThingsAreMoving,I like to stare at printed pages and hallucinate vividly for hours
12-04-2018T19:43:43,ThingsAreMoving,and it's not sleeping
12-04-2018T19:43:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Sleep is mainly for the regeneration of cells
12-04-2018T19:44:00,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"yeah, but why? I could use those ours much more effectively if I didn't have to sleep"
12-04-2018T19:44:07,Nillalee113,Imagine inducing dreams that you could consistently control
12-04-2018T19:44:10,ItsActuallyKopyKat,hours*
12-04-2018T19:44:21,ThingsAreMoving,"Nillalee, been there, done that"
12-04-2018T19:44:44,Nillalee113,how?
12-04-2018T19:44:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I have ice cream in the freezer I‚Äôll be back
12-04-2018T19:44:54,ThingsAreMoving,lucid dreaming
12-04-2018T19:44:56,NeonMitsumi,@MarvTheHugPharaoh Is this lagging? :cneonmitsumi-katgoesnyooooom:
12-04-2018T19:45:04,ItsActuallyKopyKat,There's a lot of literature online about inducing lucid dreams
12-04-2018T19:45:06,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"and no, neon"
12-04-2018T19:45:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,not any more thanks ho
12-04-2018T19:45:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,tho
12-04-2018T19:45:15,NeonMitsumi,Who you callin a ho
12-04-2018T19:45:17,ThingsAreMoving,"ho, lol"
12-04-2018T19:45:19,Nillalee113,but how do you do it consistently?
12-04-2018T19:45:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
12-04-2018T19:45:22,NeonMitsumi,Bish
12-04-2018T19:45:25,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Practice, Nilla"
12-04-2018T19:45:28,ThingsAreMoving,^
12-04-2018T19:45:29,Vatruvius,Science has shown that sleeping does significantly help the human brain...to what effect we still do not know. What we do know is if you are sleep deprived...your body will specify REM sleep over everything else.
12-04-2018T19:46:22,Nillalee113,But what do you practice? I've been trying for almost a year to even get one dream
12-04-2018T19:46:27,ItsActuallyKopyKat,lel
12-04-2018T19:46:36,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"If you're trying TOO hard, it won't work either"
12-04-2018T19:46:41,Nillalee113,lucid dream that is
12-04-2018T19:46:42,ThingsAreMoving,get one dream?
12-04-2018T19:46:47,ItsActuallyKopyKat,You just gotta find what works for you
12-04-2018T19:46:53,ThingsAreMoving,you don't remember your dreams?
12-04-2018T19:47:00,Nillalee113,rarely
12-04-2018T19:47:08,ThingsAreMoving,that might be the problem
12-04-2018T19:47:08,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Obviously, not everyone's head is the same, so it's hard to make a universal to-do list"
12-04-2018T19:47:20,Vatruvius,You only remember your dreams if you wake up before that part of your sleep cycle does not finish.
12-04-2018T19:47:31,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"A pre-flight checklist, if you will"
12-04-2018T19:47:42,Vatruvius,You actually go through periods of sleep of having dreams to no dreams multiple times in one night.
12-04-2018T19:47:52,ItsActuallyKopyKat,^^
12-04-2018T19:47:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember one dream in particular because I became aware it was a dream mid-dream
12-04-2018T19:47:55,ThingsAreMoving,"I remember all of my dreams for hours after waking up, some even replay after a while and develop some complex stories"
12-04-2018T19:48:05,Nillalee113,I know about the stages of sleep. Ive taken a few psych courses
12-04-2018T19:48:15,ThingsAreMoving,so it;s easier for me to tell that I'm dreaming
12-04-2018T19:48:40,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"I found that writing about what dreams I remember helps me have more dreams that I remember...of course, if you don't remember any to begin with, that might be a little hard."
12-04-2018T19:49:09,Vatruvius,I suppose that is possible...though I tend to sleep pretty well. The only dreams I remember lately have been exciting dreams that stick with me after I wake up.
12-04-2018T19:49:10,ThingsAreMoving,you could try meditation
12-04-2018T19:49:40,SpazztasticKiwi,My brain can‚Äôt shut up long enough for meditation
12-04-2018T19:49:53,Nillalee113,Do you think if i tried waking up at a different time it would wake me in a different stage of sleep?
12-04-2018T19:49:59,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Also
12-04-2018T19:50:02,ThingsAreMoving,"you're not supposed to stop thinking during meditation, lol"
12-04-2018T19:50:14,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"I know it sounds weird, but...do exciting stuff every once in a while"
12-04-2018T19:50:15,ThingsAreMoving,it's like... slow down
12-04-2018T19:50:36,Combak,"No. You can't really wake up from a different stage of sleep without something alarming happening, like an alarm going off."
12-04-2018T19:50:41,ThingsAreMoving,"let the thoughts wander a bit, but don't fall asleep"
12-04-2018T19:50:52,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"If you just do the same thing, every day, you will only think about that routine, everyday. Shake things up a bit and go skydiving one weekend"
12-04-2018T19:50:52,Vatruvius,"lol...it is hard to meditate. I have done it before but it is really interesting. The best way I found to meditate is to imagine a ball as small as a grain of sand inside of you and imagine it growing ever so slowly until it is as big as you, then your,"
12-04-2018T19:51:10,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Or go fishing. Do something that you'll remember, and give yourself fuel to dream about"
12-04-2018T19:51:13,ThingsAreMoving,"Combak, ever had sleep paralysis?"
12-04-2018T19:51:15,totallynotTrace,in high school spych class we had a project where we would record our dreams. try keeping a pad of paper directly next to the bed and as soon as possible start writting when you wake up
12-04-2018T19:51:20,Vatruvius,"then your home, your town/city, state, country, the world, solar system, etc. Then go backwards until it is the a grain of sand again."
12-04-2018T19:51:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Haven‚Äôt been fishing in years
12-04-2018T19:51:45,Nillalee113,"Vatru, should it be during silence?"
12-04-2018T19:51:47,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Love the sound of dragonflies buzzing by
12-04-2018T19:52:28,ThingsAreMoving,I have a 10hr thunderstorm that I put on when going to sleep
12-04-2018T19:52:40,totallynotTrace,spring peepers (frogs that are chirping) is the single most relaxing thing for me. I can actually hear them outside my house right now
12-04-2018T19:52:45,ThingsAreMoving,a record ofone*
12-04-2018T19:52:53,Vatruvius,Does not specify but yeah...that helps. I practiced it in my martial arts class I took a long time ago...it was always quiet.

12-04-2018T21:11:15,TheFDdriver,wb Vat
12-04-2018T21:11:21,TheFDdriver,mine is the worst
12-04-2018T21:11:22,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Hi Tav
12-04-2018T21:12:02,Bgrmystr2,"That's like, your opinion Sage."
12-04-2018T21:12:08,Vatruvius,So I assume that is Brahn wearing the cap?
12-04-2018T21:12:14,Vatruvius,cape*
12-04-2018T21:12:24,SageSaga,Mihari's is Animated - and you cant have animated avatars anymore so-
12-04-2018T21:12:30,ThingsAreMoving,that's Trace's hairstyle
12-04-2018T21:12:38,TheBeckoner,Hello peoples.
12-04-2018T21:12:42,ThingsAreMoving,o/ Beck
12-04-2018T21:12:46,TheFDdriver,hello Beck
12-04-2018T21:12:48,Sammit,HI Beck
12-04-2018T21:12:48,NightMeaty22,hello beck
12-04-2018T21:12:56,Vatruvius,Brahn's hairstyle is Trace's without the little bit that sticks up.
12-04-2018T21:12:58,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"that is indeed the best avatar, then"
12-04-2018T21:13:05,Bgrmystr2,Because animation means everything. Gotcha.
12-04-2018T21:13:12,Vatruvius,Could be hard to discern in a sketch.
12-04-2018T21:13:48,Vatruvius,I will be right back after feeding the doggies.
12-04-2018T21:13:52,SageSaga,it means it's unique and we consider those things to be valuable
12-04-2018T21:14:09,Vatruvius,Do we though Sage? :ptv-hearts:
12-04-2018T21:14:14,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Like diamonds- artificially unique and rare
12-04-2018T21:14:39,TheFDdriver,"like the ""black hole thing"""
12-04-2018T21:14:39,SageSaga,yes - thousands of years of human history have had people valuing things for their rarity- so yes
12-04-2018T21:14:58,MagicEnchilladas,mostly shiny things
12-04-2018T21:15:05,Nekonny,it's a shame tho
12-04-2018T21:15:10,ItsActuallyKopyKat,does that mean that we are all the most valuable tings in the universe? There is only one of each of us!
12-04-2018T21:15:19,TheFDdriver,how rare is a 1920's pencil
12-04-2018T21:15:20,ZRO4825,"Oh, they disabled the animated avatars, even for premium users? That sucks."
12-04-2018T21:15:22,ItsActuallyKopyKat,*wholesomeness intensifies*
12-04-2018T21:15:25,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Anyone get made fun of ""liking"" furrys?"
12-04-2018T21:15:27,NightMeaty22,what is da shiny
12-04-2018T21:15:32,Nekonny,not everything that is rare is valuable
12-04-2018T21:15:33,DRAGONTANOPUG,Or is just me
12-04-2018T21:15:47,TheBeckoner,Just you.

12-04-2018T21:16:19,Bgrmystr2,Yeah zro. They wanted to remove the feature so people can't make icons that induce siesures or whatnot
12-04-2018T21:16:22,TheBeckoner,That's like...standard furry vocab
12-04-2018T21:16:31,DRAGONTANOPUG,sighs
12-04-2018T21:16:36,Bgrmystr2,but then they decided to play favorites and leave anyone that already had an animated one with one
12-04-2018T21:16:40,NightMeaty22,but... i have no friends so...
12-04-2018T21:16:51,RH0DE,thats sad
12-04-2018T21:16:52,ZRO4825,"Only for the more toxic elements of the community, Beckoner."

12-04-2018T21:53:30,Vatruvius,Does inappropriate sound like an epic meaning?
12-04-2018T21:53:38,Dimensional,"Hmm. What would happen if Ron streams Tom's stream, and Tom streams Ron's stream..."
12-04-2018T21:53:41,Dimensional,Stream-ception?

12-04-2018T21:54:57,Dimensional,Then they really could stream the other's works.
12-04-2018T21:55:08,DarthRexKing,I do not believe this Ron is tom. I believe ItsActually a KopyKat.
12-04-2018T21:55:21,Bgrmystr2,I guess I would question why Ron wouldn't be doing the same :thinking:
12-04-2018T21:55:32,ItsActuallyKopyKat,You what?
12-04-2018T21:55:37,DarthRexKing,&gt;w&gt;

12-04-2018T22:13:51,Nekonny,so https://www.patreon.com/nekonny
12-04-2018T22:13:59,Vatruvius,So you guys have enough bandwidth to stream all three streams at once?
12-04-2018T22:14:00,Nekonny,if you think you migth want somethign XD
12-04-2018T22:14:11,Bgrmystr2,I do Vatru
12-04-2018T22:14:12,Ordithus,"Yes, Vatru"
12-04-2018T22:14:14,Nekonny,Goodnight guys!
12-04-2018T22:14:18,Vatruvius,I can only do one.
12-04-2018T22:14:25,Vatruvius,Woo Hoo DSL!
12-04-2018T22:14:33,Twokinds,Night!
12-04-2018T22:14:36,SageSaga,yeah you only need like 2kb per stream
12-04-2018T22:14:46,BadFoMo,"Good night, Tom."
12-04-2018T22:14:47,Bgrmystr2,I've done.. 6 at once? Maybe 7? It just depends on what the bitrate of the stream is
12-04-2018T22:15:45,Vatruvius,2kb is not much...but I have a hard time streaming just one...maybe has something to do with stability or something from my service provider?
12-04-2018T22:15:47,Vatruvius,Not sure.
12-04-2018T22:16:17,Ordithus,*2Mbps per stream
12-04-2018T22:16:27,Bgrmystr2,that sounds more accurate Ord
12-04-2018T22:16:28,Bgrmystr2,I was gonna say
12-04-2018T22:16:31,SageSaga,yeah
12-04-2018T22:16:32,Bgrmystr2,2kb sounds a bit low
12-04-2018T22:16:40,SageSaga,mistyped
12-04-2018T22:16:49,Vatruvius,Alright...then 2 would be pushing it and 3 is over my DSL bandwidth.
12-04-2018T22:16:52,CarlEBF,bandwidth is not the limiting factor for me usually it's that my computer can't handle that much at once
12-04-2018T22:17:06,ItsActuallyKopyKat,nig rip Carl
12-04-2018T22:17:10,ItsActuallyKopyKat,big****
12-04-2018T22:17:13,Vatruvius,I got a beefy laptop so it can handle a lot.
12-04-2018T22:17:15,Ordithus,"Yeah, watching more than 4 uses a bit of cpu"
12-04-2018T22:17:25,SageSaga,i only have 100 Mb download
12-04-2018T22:17:37,Bgrmystr2,my CPU is usually the limiter for me. But I can't really watch more than 6 and that's about my cpu's limit anyway
12-04-2018T22:17:39,DRAGONTANOPUG,Walking ded fan right here! RIP CARL
12-04-2018T22:17:57,Vatruvius,With Chrome I have to watch my memory usage...just this window alone and nothing else uses 1/3 of my memory. Granted...I do not have a lot of memory but still.
12-04-2018T22:18:12,Bgrmystr2,happens vatru
12-04-2018T22:18:21,Vatruvius,I will take your 100 Mb any day Sage.
12-04-2018T22:18:26,Vatruvius,I got 5Mb
12-04-2018T22:18:33,RH0DE,i got 12mbps
12-04-2018T22:18:37,Bgrmystr2,"I'd gladly share mine, Vatru. I've got 100Mb down as well"
12-04-2018T22:18:50,DRAGONTANOPUG,Ove got 2
12-04-2018T22:19:02,Vatruvius,Too bad DSL is all they have out here...AT&T is actually pulling out and not installing any new lines.
12-04-2018T22:19:08,DRAGONTANOPUG,2 mb
12-04-2018T22:19:17,RH0DE,oof
12-04-2018T22:19:24,Vatruvius,Feel for you Dragon
12-04-2018T22:19:27,Bgrmystr2,"You probably are talkin about 2MB, Dragon lol"
12-04-2018T22:19:34,DRAGONTANOPUG,Cant even play call of duty
12-04-2018T22:19:45,Vatruvius,That would be 2Mb
12-04-2018T22:20:18,Bgrmystr2,"I don't think he would know the difference between the capital and lowercase B, Vatru"
12-04-2018T22:20:25,DRAGONTANOPUG,Still we pay 50 bucks a month for it
12-04-2018T22:20:26,Ordithus,I remember 32 Kbps.  Those were the days.
12-04-2018T22:20:32,DRAGONTANOPUG,Lol
12-04-2018T22:20:32,Bgrmystr2,2Mb is super slow
12-04-2018T22:20:36,Vatruvius,Yeah...but not being able to play an online game sounds like low internet.
12-04-2018T22:20:50,NeonMitsumi,"Lmao, my download is 500 kbps"
12-04-2018T22:20:53,Vatruvius,I pay more than you Dragon...way more.
12-04-2018T22:20:58,DRAGONTANOPUG,I know it is try download a game and it says 2 Mb
12-04-2018T22:21:03,Vatruvius,No way Neon.
12-04-2018T22:21:11,DRAGONTANOPUG,My dad has a crazy 300 Mb
12-04-2018T22:21:11,Vatruvius,Those has to be bytes
12-04-2018T22:21:11,Bgrmystr2,"yeah that's a capital B, Dragon"
12-04-2018T22:21:34,Bgrmystr2,"when you're looking at downloads, it's bytes"
12-04-2018T22:21:38,DRAGONTANOPUG,Xbox tray play discs unplugged it shook it put it in the fridge took it out and it plays discs now
12-04-2018T22:21:38,Bgrmystr2,internet speed is rated at bits
12-04-2018T22:21:44,ItsActuallyKopyKat,^^
12-04-2018T22:21:45,Ordithus,1 Byte = 8 bit
12-04-2018T22:21:54,DRAGONTANOPUG,Sorry it didn't play discs now it does after I did that
12-04-2018T22:21:59,Vatruvius,Why do they even talk about internet in bits...is it a selling point because it is a bigger number?
12-04-2018T22:22:03,Ordithus,Yep
12-04-2018T22:22:15,Bgrmystr2,"A lot of times yes, Vatru"
12-04-2018T22:22:20,GeneticMedic,a int is 4 bytes
12-04-2018T22:22:23,Bgrmystr2,because people aren't smart and just look at bigger = better
12-04-2018T22:22:24,Ordithus,Like a gallon of gas being 2.399 instead of 2.40
12-04-2018T22:22:39,Bgrmystr2,or 1 cent cheaper = better
12-04-2018T22:23:20,Vatruvius,"AT&T: ""Come use our play...get a MASSIVE 5 Mbps!"" You buy it and your true download speed...600KBps"
12-04-2018T22:23:26,Vatruvius,Not even 1MBps
12-04-2018T22:23:29,Bgrmystr2,tis why hard drive sizes tend to be misleading
12-04-2018T22:23:32,SageSaga,"there ya go - 2 different sayings that totally lie while telling the truth - You get what you pay for, and cheaper is better"
12-04-2018T22:24:04,DRAGONTANOPUG,Woohoo about to spend $20 on 24000 Call of Duty points

12-04-2018T22:28:32,Vatruvius,If I had any throw away money...like cash that I had no idea what to do with after giving to charity and stuff...I would probably give to patreon. To people I feel like earned it and I have the ability to do so.
12-04-2018T22:28:32,SageSaga,guys if his father made that much he could easily talk his father into giving him a thousand to give Tom through patreon. So obviously he doesnt
12-04-2018T22:28:42,Keeeef,i guess bad timing then
12-04-2018T22:28:58,Bgrmystr2,I dunno what you mean @Keeeef

12-04-2018T22:29:30,DRAGONTANOPUG,Hes a selfish jerk who clearly cheated on my mom

12-04-2018T23:43:33,Vatruvius,I am all for Tom doing what he wants...just wondering if he left the title page as I came back after he moved on to something else.
12-04-2018T23:43:37,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"what do you mean, he's ""just passing time"""
12-04-2018T23:44:05,Vatruvius,Well...filling the stream with other stuff he has to get done and not the title page Kopy.

12-04-2018T23:48:57,BadFoMo,Call the next chapter 'Indecisive'. Trace can't chouse between his old and new lives.
12-04-2018T23:49:05,HeresyArtStream,this is a good Mihari
12-04-2018T23:49:09,unsteddyphoenix,Aw Tom giving us a nice long stream while suffering &lt;3

12-04-2018T23:49:15,Dimensional,I hear cuddling with catgirls helps. Maybe Flora can snuggle and give you a massage on your head.
12-04-2018T23:49:16,unsteddyphoenix,What a hero of the people
12-04-2018T23:49:17,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Tom, did you try turning it off and then on again?"

12-04-2018T23:53:36,ZRO4825,XD
12-04-2018T23:53:39,unsteddyphoenix,You have started multiple comics
12-04-2018T23:53:43,ZRO4825,I beg to differ. :P
12-04-2018T23:53:43,Kanrod,"Evening, Fluff! :)"
12-04-2018T23:53:49,Vatruvius,How to be buff at 13 years of age? :ptv-wondering:
12-04-2018T23:53:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Is that another Mirahin
12-04-2018T23:54:03,SpazztasticKiwi,They say the first 10 pounds is the easiest. Then each 10 pounds after that just gets harder and harder
12-04-2018T23:54:07,unsteddyphoenix,Anotha one
12-04-2018T23:54:09,ZRO4825,That's easy. Have bodybuilder parents who try to get you started on the family hobby young.
12-04-2018T23:54:10,SageSaga,it gets easier making comics if you just do it for 14 years
12-04-2018T23:54:16,Bgrmystr2,"yknow, I'm actually curious what a page of twokinds would look like if you drew it, Fluff"
12-04-2018T23:54:22,ZRO4825,:thinking: Sage got a point there.
12-04-2018T23:54:30,unsteddyphoenix,well thats simple
12-04-2018T23:54:37,ZRO4825,"There ya go, Fluff. Idea for Patreon monthly reward. A TK page done by Fluff."

12-04-2018T23:54:57,Kanrod,Nah
12-04-2018T23:54:59,Vatruvius,I think it would be safe to say after doing something for 14 years you would be pretty good at it...I hope anyway. Cannot speak for idiots.
12-04-2018T23:54:59,Ordithus,"No goatee, no evil twin"
12-04-2018T23:55:04,Kanrod,Just Adira

12-04-2018T23:55:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I could believe your floof is about 10 pounds though
