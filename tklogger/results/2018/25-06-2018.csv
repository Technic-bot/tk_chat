25-06-2018T01:27:56,Bgrmystr2,that's what they've been doing
25-06-2018T01:27:58,ItsActuallyKopyKat,this is majorly a giant dumpster fire

25-06-2018T01:28:57,Bgrmystr2,even though tom's got nothing that would be considered as such

25-06-2018T01:31:47,Bgrmystr2,that's what I'm thinking
25-06-2018T01:31:52,Bgrmystr2,he may actually end up doing that
25-06-2018T01:32:06,Bgrmystr2,it'd be hell on the web dev though
25-06-2018T01:32:07,Vatruvius,Posting on Deviant or somesuch.
25-06-2018T01:32:11,Bgrmystr2,cuz he doesn't do the website himself
25-06-2018T01:32:20,MallardDuckAvia,He already has a fan art section (although it’s outdated and hasn’t been touched in a while)
25-06-2018T01:32:29,Toxic8Bit,beat me to it Vat :)

25-06-2018T01:33:06,Toxic8Bit,^
25-06-2018T01:33:11,Bgrmystr2,there can just be a subsection of the site for uploading art
25-06-2018T01:33:16,MallardDuckAvia,Maybe he has links to the download too
25-06-2018T01:33:33,Bgrmystr2,well he wouldn't be able to link it on picarto
25-06-2018T01:33:37,Bgrmystr2,erh
25-06-2018T01:33:43,Bgrmystr2,can't link it on patreon**
25-06-2018T01:33:47,Vatruvius,"This is dumb, especially since his patreon is already labeled adult, 18+ just in case."
25-06-2018T01:33:54,Bgrmystr2,cuz that's part of the new rules
25-06-2018T01:33:55,MallardDuckAvia,Yeah
25-06-2018T01:34:06,Bgrmystr2,that's probably why they did it vatru
25-06-2018T01:34:15,NightMeaty22,...
25-06-2018T01:34:23,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, if it wasn't labeled 18+, they may have just banned his account straight up"

25-06-2018T01:34:58,MallardDuckAvia,Well I already saved my favorites on my phone so I’m good for now.
25-06-2018T01:35:04,Vatruvius,I will label my patreon adult than when I get to my comic...
25-06-2018T01:35:18,Vatruvius,then*
25-06-2018T01:35:22,Bgrmystr2,"It'd have to be behind a paywall though, vatru"
25-06-2018T01:35:35,MallardDuckAvia,BTW should I start a patreon and draw airplanes?
25-06-2018T01:35:48,Bgrmystr2,"if you don't post anything patreon considers ""adult"", then you should be fine posting it elsewhere"
25-06-2018T01:36:09,Vatruvius,"Yeah, though it will mostly be for support first. Not gonna be doing suggestions and stuff right off the bat."
25-06-2018T01:36:10,MallardDuckAvia,Would Patreon flag airplanes as adult content?
25-06-2018T01:36:22,Bgrmystr2,I mean..
25-06-2018T01:36:29,Bgrmystr2,I've seen shit :ptv-uneasy:
25-06-2018T01:36:38,Bgrmystr2,"but I would default to ""no"""
25-06-2018T01:36:42,MallardDuckAvia,Ok
25-06-2018T01:36:45,Bgrmystr2,xD
25-06-2018T01:37:01,Vatruvius,Depends on tge airplane...XD
25-06-2018T01:37:03,MallardDuckAvia,I might post some drawings tomorrow after my next flight lesson
25-06-2018T01:37:20,MallardDuckAvia,Just normal airliners
25-06-2018T01:37:22,Bgrmystr2,"xD Vatru if it's a normal realistic airplane, then no it wouldn't be"
25-06-2018T01:37:30,Bgrmystr2,but.. the internet.
25-06-2018T01:37:36,Bgrmystr2,she is a weirrrd place.
25-06-2018T01:37:44,MallardDuckAvia,No Aeromorphs or gay stuff like that
25-06-2018T01:37:47,Bgrmystr2,hhahaha
25-06-2018T01:37:52,Bgrmystr2,you should be fine then
25-06-2018T01:37:56,Vatruvius,"I don't know, something about a P-51 just gets me going..."
25-06-2018T01:37:59,MallardDuckAvia,They almost ruined aviation for me
25-06-2018T01:38:25,MallardDuckAvia,I prefer the a320 and 787 over the P-51

25-06-2018T01:40:37,NightMeaty22,Thats why i cant get one
25-06-2018T01:40:39,MallardDuckAvia,I’ve got 1 hour and 20 minutes flight time so far
25-06-2018T01:41:04,NightMeaty22,My dad was a pilot
25-06-2018T01:41:07,MallardDuckAvia,"$4,500 is cheap for a pilots license. It’s usually closer to $10,000"
25-06-2018T01:41:54,NightMeaty22,But he doesn't fly any more
25-06-2018T01:42:16,MallardDuckAvia,It’s 11:40 here and I’m flying at 9:00 am. I gotta sleep. Good night everyone
25-06-2018T01:42:21,NightMeaty22,It just costs too much

25-06-2018T01:43:42,Vatruvius,"There it is right there in tge Patreon community guidelines, if it is marked adult content then it also has to be patron only. Stupid."
25-06-2018T01:43:53,Vatruvius,Bye Mallard!
25-06-2018T01:44:26,Toxic8Bit,You said it
25-06-2018T01:44:46,Bgrmystr2,agree vatru.
25-06-2018T01:44:53,Bgrmystr2,it is unbelivably stupid
25-06-2018T01:44:58,Bgrmystr2,seeya mallard
25-06-2018T01:45:09,Bgrmystr2,why is patreon forcing people to paywall
25-06-2018T01:45:14,Bgrmystr2,they're only going to hurt artists
25-06-2018T01:45:20,Bgrmystr2,and people are going to leave
25-06-2018T01:45:57,Vatruvius,They are going to hurt artists and themselves once someone is pissed off enough to create a new sight that doesn't do that...
25-06-2018T01:46:49,Vatruvius,"I am not loyal to Patreon, I do not donate to Tom because he is on Patreon. If he moves, my money goes with him."
25-06-2018T01:47:03,BadFoMo,This is that YouTube and Google+ thing again isn't it?
25-06-2018T01:47:29,Vatruvius,Not sure what you are talking about?
25-06-2018T01:49:22,Vatruvius,At least Sage seems okay at the moment.
25-06-2018T01:49:40,BadFoMo,There was ones a time when YouTube tried to force its users to get a Google+ account so that they could upload videos.
25-06-2018T01:49:52,BadFoMo,*once
25-06-2018T01:50:26,Bgrmystr2,"yeah it's basically the same thing, Fomo"
25-06-2018T01:50:48,Bgrmystr2,The website trying to force everyone to do something that the site shouldn't have any power over
25-06-2018T01:50:49,Vatruvius,"But you are right Bgr, it may be because Tom indicated adult content tgat it flagged tge system and Patreon took a closer look. But if Patreon were to find Ssge's work, it may be an instant ban for not being marked adult. Who knows?"
25-06-2018T01:51:01,Bgrmystr2,"perhaps, vatru"
25-06-2018T01:51:17,Bgrmystr2,"maybe if tom takes off the adult sticker, it'll be fine, but"
25-06-2018T01:51:18,Bgrmystr2,I dunno
25-06-2018T01:51:47,Vatruvius,"If it is a person looking at it, which it likely is, then probably not."
25-06-2018T01:52:14,NightMeaty22,Well... i got to get some sleep cya
25-06-2018T01:52:27,NightMeaty22,Have a nice day
25-06-2018T01:52:46,Vatruvius,Not sure how a bot can determine Tom's content as adult unless it is just looking tor tge adult tag abd patreon tag to be together.
25-06-2018T01:52:53,Vatruvius,Goodnight Meaty!
25-06-2018T01:53:09,NightMeaty22,Goodnight all

25-06-2018T01:54:50,BadFoMo,Twitter maybe?
25-06-2018T01:55:20,BadFoMo,"Also, I don't trust bots."
25-06-2018T01:56:08,Vatruvius,Like with the who ll e google bots screwing over content creators?

25-06-2018T01:59:35,Vatruvius,"Well, I am getting into programming so maybe I will help this situation by not doing what these companies do. Why should a site like Patreon have any say in how an artist would like yo run tgeir page and art?"

25-06-2018T02:08:08,Vatruvius,"I know, but they could sue me for creating a near identical service with a reversed name, no?"
25-06-2018T02:09:56,Vatruvius,"Hmm...what if I were to incorporate the sight to both act like patreon and picarto? It is a support sight, artists can upload their work, and they can stream on the same platform, everything is connected."

25-06-2018T03:12:49,Vatruvius,"Tell me about. With my laptop, peripherals, desk, chair, I am looking at 3k...:ptv-confused:"
25-06-2018T03:13:01,Vatruvius,about it*
25-06-2018T03:13:20,Vatruvius,I have around 100...
25-06-2018T03:15:36,Toxic8Bit,"Thats why I got free photoshop, but it would be nice if you could just 3D-print out the rest the all the same"
25-06-2018T03:16:48,Vatruvius,"Yeah, sadly 3d printingbis not there yet. One day..."
25-06-2018T03:17:01,Vatruvius,printing*
25-06-2018T03:17:33,Vatruvius,"Seriously, why is this key board messing up so badly?!"
25-06-2018T03:18:46,Toxic8Bit,"Not sure, but I don't mind :)"
25-06-2018T03:22:05,Toxic8Bit,"Lazy Nezumi Pro is a good brush stabilization plugin for Photoshop, it costs $35"
25-06-2018T03:22:30,Toxic8Bit,It works pretty good
25-06-2018T03:22:40,Vatruvius,It is just frustrating me because I am a bit of a grammar and spelling nerd and like things to read well. That and I normally type on a computer keyboard so...yeah. I just have to take it slow.
25-06-2018T03:23:11,Vatruvius,Brush stabilizer?
25-06-2018T03:24:56,Toxic8Bit,"Like if you move/paint with the stylus or mouse, it smooths the lines"
25-06-2018T03:26:51,Vatruvius,"Huh...why though? Is that not part of drawing? With practice you can draw pretty smoothly, though I guess it is great for people with less practice or just starting out."
25-06-2018T03:27:28,Vatruvius,With a mouse I can totally understand. That is just a disaster.
25-06-2018T03:27:31,Toxic8Bit,Can help with stuff like jitter from your hands
25-06-2018T03:27:47,Vatruvius,Hmm...
25-06-2018T03:28:16,Toxic8Bit,I also think Photoshop includes this somewhat
25-06-2018T03:28:37,Vatruvius,Probably...
25-06-2018T03:28:47,Toxic8Bit,Paint tool Sai has similar
25-06-2018T03:30:54,Toxic8Bit,"But practice is very good, although a tablet without a screen is slightly harder than paper"
25-06-2018T03:31:09,Vatruvius,"I don't have so much a problem with jitter or drawing all that much, it is getting the proportions right that I need practice with. Especially with getting what I see in my head down with my hand. I have a slight disconnect there."
25-06-2018T03:32:00,Toxic8Bit,Me too
25-06-2018T03:32:52,Vatruvius,"But that is what I think is great about drawing digitally. I can just undo instead of erase, erase, erase, ersae every time I draw on paper."
25-06-2018T03:33:15,Vatruvius,erase *
25-06-2018T03:34:53,Vatruvius,The best advice I can give is just practice sketching without ever erasing or in this case undoing. Make the image what you want. Go over tte lines to get tge end result. This is great to hone your skills and lets you feel like you are making progress.
25-06-2018T03:35:25,Vatruvius,the* the*
25-06-2018T03:36:20,Toxic8Bit,"Been drawing since I was 15, 21 now and things seem a similar difficulty to that when I started. Good idea, will try"
25-06-2018T03:37:22,Vatruvius,"Yeah, I have not been drawing long but I do have a talent. Or at least Iam capable. I have drawn a numbe"
25-06-2018T03:37:43,Vatruvius,number of good drawings.
25-06-2018T03:38:13,Vatruvius,Some formal advice andvteachings has also helped.
25-06-2018T03:38:58,Vatruvius,That and personal experiences of redrawing over and over stuck on just getting start
25-06-2018T03:39:09,Vatruvius,ed.
25-06-2018T03:40:28,Toxic8Bit,"Yeah, I got to say that TwoKinds (especially these streams) helped teach and encourage me more :)"
25-06-2018T03:41:57,Vatruvius,"Also very good practice, every time you draw spend 5 or 10 monutes filling a page with circles and very long, single stroke lines. Build up that muscle memore. Also, you may have heard of this, but draw with your should not your elbow. Your elbow should."
25-06-2018T03:43:09,Vatruvius,"Yeah, the comic is what inspired the dream I had that made me want to create s comic! And here I am looking forward to drawing, something I thought I would never look gorward to after my last experience with it."
25-06-2018T03:43:59,Vatruvius,Your elbow should float.*

25-06-2018T03:45:11,Toxic8Bit,Good advice
25-06-2018T03:46:03,Vatruvius,I figured some of the stuff the expensive tuition was telling me has got to have some bases.
25-06-2018T03:46:38,Vatruvius,Sure as hell letting it be spent for nothing.
25-06-2018T03:46:49,Vatruvius,not letting*
25-06-2018T03:49:38,Toxic8Bit,Where/how did you learn to draw?
25-06-2018T03:52:10,Vatruvius,"Well, most of my drawing cane from my community college where I learned to draft by hand. Super staight lines and perfect angles with soecific perspectives. The expensive tuition bit was my one semester spent at ASU where I took drawing classes to"
25-06-2018T03:53:35,Vatruvius,"become an industrial designer. I later decided thst was not the right major nor career path, but I did build up a portfolio, learned some things, and learned to draw more artistically but with a purpose."
25-06-2018T03:56:05,Toxic8Bit,Yeah I was just self taught (someday class). Also how did you get into furries :)
25-06-2018T03:56:09,Vatruvius,"One big take away I had was that any phisical limitations can be ironed with practice, lots of it. The hard part was seeing it which I was lucky enough to be born with. So the real challenge for me is getting my visions down, iron out my physical"
25-06-2018T03:56:35,Vatruvius,"limitations and work on drawing orfanically, people and such."
25-06-2018T03:57:05,Vatruvius,Porn...duh!
25-06-2018T03:57:12,Vatruvius,No...
25-06-2018T03:57:27,Bgrmystr2,lolo

25-06-2018T03:58:42,Vatruvius,"I think I just do not ind it because a lot of my childhood was spent watching those animal kids movies like Lion King, etc. So as I got older a more humanoid versions of animals did not seem to be that outlandish to me."
25-06-2018T03:59:58,Vatruvius,"That and I see furry characters differently, though made to be human they clearly are not so having had a rough childhood I associated myself with these characters more tgan anything else."
25-06-2018T04:00:33,Toxic8Bit,"Pretty much the same, don't know when it started exatly for me Slycooper/Sonic possibly?"
25-06-2018T04:01:43,Vatruvius,"Yeah...the furry community is commonly associated with porn snd sex and whatever but hey, I don't want those people here anyway."
25-06-2018T04:02:40,Toxic8Bit,Yeah Cute is Better :ptv-hearts:
25-06-2018T04:03:03,Vatruvius,"And even so, thinking so of these characters is a lot better in my opinion then some of the shit humans think of for each other."
25-06-2018T04:03:40,Vatruvius,"I love dressing up as a horse snd gaging myself, bring out the leash."
25-06-2018T04:03:57,Vatruvius,Stupid in my opinion.
25-06-2018T04:05:21,Vatruvius,"That, and I have found those part of a furry community have more lax views on what is human. We all associate with these characters others see an animals."
25-06-2018T04:06:02,Vatruvius,I hope that all made sense...:ctwokinds-daydreamingkat:
25-06-2018T04:07:06,Toxic8Bit,Yeah :). Tom's stuff fits almost exactly as me and my bros think
25-06-2018T04:07:20,Vatruvius,Yeah.
25-06-2018T04:07:47,Bgrmystr2,I just kinda.. do my thing and look at stuff I like and ignore the stuff I don't.
25-06-2018T04:08:02,Bgrmystr2,"If I don't like it, it's not made for me, it's made for someone else."
25-06-2018T04:08:08,Bgrmystr2,so ;v
25-06-2018T04:08:14,Bgrmystr2,it's very simple
25-06-2018T04:08:55,Vatruvius,My parents fit in that group of people who tholink such a thing is unatural. Beastialiry is how they put it...they also are quick to judge people so...proves my point.
25-06-2018T04:11:14,Bgrmystr2,more people who can't tell the difference between art and reality. :ptv-uneasy:
25-06-2018T04:11:21,Bgrmystr2,pity
25-06-2018T04:11:27,Bgrmystr2,lot of people out there like that
25-06-2018T04:11:35,Bgrmystr2,art is art. reality is reality. the two are not the same
25-06-2018T04:11:37,Vatruvius,Yeah.
25-06-2018T04:11:59,Toxic8Bit,"My mom is ok with furry, now that she sees past stereotypes, but our dad, put it this way I would not bring it up to him"
25-06-2018T04:12:00,Bgrmystr2,just because it exists for one does not mean it's the same for the other.
25-06-2018T04:13:32,Vatruvius,"Yeah, I would not bring any of this up with either of my parents. And if I were to start my comic...certainly not going tell them where I post it. ""Ohh...it is just for me."""
25-06-2018T04:14:00,Vatruvius,"""A creative outlet."""
25-06-2018T04:14:17,Vatruvius,Though that last bit is true...
25-06-2018T04:15:10,Toxic8Bit,"My bros and I could not live without it, Srsly"
25-06-2018T04:16:38,Vatruvius,"Yeah, I was surprised I had not found all of this sooner. I came here what...3...4 months ago from sheer whim because I watched an old Markiplier video that sponsored Twokinds."
25-06-2018T04:17:02,Vatruvius,Been here ever since supporting Tom along the way.
25-06-2018T04:17:23,Toxic8Bit,"Our mom is actually helping us come up with our own comic, not noticed by our dad of course :ptv-hearts:"
25-06-2018T04:17:39,Vatruvius,lol
25-06-2018T04:21:45,Vatruvius,I am coming up with my comic on my own which suits me fine. It is my story and bring the level of detail and creativity I like in pne format really helps me out. There is no bounds to what I cam do. Beats what bounds are inherent in video games.
25-06-2018T04:22:19,Toxic8Bit,"Yeah, I guess you could say furries are my Mana-Pool/Energy source, whenever I see them I feel very joyful. Like maybe we were once in a world with them :)"
25-06-2018T04:22:21,Vatruvius,bringing* one*
25-06-2018T04:24:40,Vatruvius,"Ah yes, nothing like living in the world you created. Furries are a great way to make thst world unique, different, and interesting. It cannot possibly be like the real world...likewise it is easy to differentiate the two...or...to see just how similar"
25-06-2018T04:25:05,Vatruvius,they are despite physical appearances.
25-06-2018T04:26:37,Vatruvius,"Anyway, it is getting really late so I better go to bed. Goodnight! :ptv-greetings:"
25-06-2018T04:27:11,Toxic8Bit,Who knows what surprises the afterlife may contain :)
25-06-2018T04:27:39,Vatruvius,Yeah...
25-06-2018T04:28:13,Toxic8Bit,"Yeah it's 5:30 am here, I should be getting to bed aswell, Goodnight :)"
25-06-2018T04:32:15,Dadrobit,Might y'all.
25-06-2018T04:32:18,Dadrobit,Night*
25-06-2018T04:43:18,Dadrobit,So Tom finally got hit huh? Honestly? Only really surprised that it didn't happen sooner.
25-06-2018T06:47:27,Xexanoth,"a week or 2 back they already hit the patreon with an ""18+ warning"", which was weird."
25-06-2018T06:55:22,Dadrobit,Is it weird? Tom did draw some rather lewd stuffs on there.
25-06-2018T09:11:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Can’t have one of those prepubescent lemurs see furry boobs
25-06-2018T09:18:35,Xexanoth,"if ""kinda lewd"" gave you an 18+ rating, alot of cartoons# would be in trouble..."
25-06-2018T09:32:52,SpazztasticKiwi,They look at possible inflections of the drawings as well as the characters
25-06-2018T09:33:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Good example is the Iris and her friend picture
25-06-2018T10:55:04,NightMeaty22,Good morning
25-06-2018T11:05:00,Dadrobit,Aye. Or like the picture with Keith waking up in bed between a naked Adelaide and Natani.
25-06-2018T11:05:54,Dadrobit,"Or any one of the countess ""provocative"" pieces he's done over the years really."
25-06-2018T11:21:17,MallardDuckAvia,So Toms Page is still under review?
25-06-2018T11:21:35,MallardDuckAvia,Just about to start the airplane right now at the airport
25-06-2018T11:39:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m at a Barnes n Noble with a D&D book
25-06-2018T11:39:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I am interested
25-06-2018T12:00:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Also I saw a Magical Motherfucker mug.
25-06-2018T12:00:31,Mippy,Just seen the Patreon page...
25-06-2018T12:01:27,Mippy,Is worried 😦
25-06-2018T12:12:17,SpazztasticKiwi,What for
25-06-2018T12:16:33,Mippy,Because I worry about a lot of things Kiwi...part of having an anxiety disorder.
25-06-2018T12:19:29,warhawk,Don't worry about the Patreon. We are far from the end of the line.
25-06-2018T12:23:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m off to watch Jurassic World & Incredibles
25-06-2018T12:25:55,Dadrobit,Gonna go watch the Incredibles over the weekend with the grandparents and a couple nieces/nephews this Saturday.
25-06-2018T12:28:50,Dadrobit,It is what it is about Patreon tbh. Shit happens. Patreon ~needs~ to do something about NSFW and adult themed work or else the entire site gets shut down.
25-06-2018T13:19:00,totallynotTrace,"im guessing it will be fine as although it certainly has some nsfw themes its not really outright sex or nudity. kinda. well. its not the F'd up fanart thats out there. so ya, I was surprised to see that as well but not concerned"
25-06-2018T13:21:06,totallynotTrace,"actually i just read this. now im concerned. ""Content with mature themes must be marked as a patron-only post."""
25-06-2018T13:40:06,TheGamePlayer,Wait what has Patreon done?
25-06-2018T13:44:31,Bgrmystr2,"Tom either has to risk turning the 18+ on his patreon off, or make everything he's posted on there that's risque as a patron-only post, meaning people are forced to pay to see it"
25-06-2018T13:45:03,TheGamePlayer,.... That's dumb
25-06-2018T13:45:39,Bgrmystr2,"yeh, and there's like 600+ individual posts tom would have to go through"
25-06-2018T13:45:47,TheGamePlayer,I will not pay... I've paid to much for this ngs and will not be forced to pay to see Tom's wonderful art!!!
25-06-2018T13:46:24,TheGamePlayer,"Where the heck did ""this ngs"" come from????"
25-06-2018T13:46:31,Xexanoth,"i mean, the 18+ warning is basicially pointless, as simpson put it: ""i'm a sign, not a cop"""
25-06-2018T13:46:35,Bgrmystr2,"he would have to make them all inaccessable within the next 5 days, including today, or he'll probably miss the next payment cycle at the beginning of the month of July"
25-06-2018T13:47:23,TheGamePlayer,I mentioned to say for everything
25-06-2018T13:47:34,TheGamePlayer,.... F u autocorrect
25-06-2018T13:48:15,Bgrmystr2,"either he won't get the payment cycle at all, or won't get any money till the 'under review' is fixed"
25-06-2018T13:48:22,Bgrmystr2,"either way, he's not gonna be getting money"
25-06-2018T13:48:44,TheGamePlayer,Got a new phone and the autocorrect is even more sensitive then my iPod 6 gen
25-06-2018T13:49:05,Bgrmystr2,it bothers me that patreon can hold back his money that people are paying him cuz they have some stick up their ass
25-06-2018T13:49:31,warhawk,"Couldnt he just ""go inaccessable"" for say 6/30-7/3 to get the cycle. Then after revert. Then all of july would be around to sort out the problem."
25-06-2018T13:49:34,TheGamePlayer,Man I feel bad for him and his family... Did anyone else here the awful news?
25-06-2018T13:49:59,Bgrmystr2,"warhawk, I dunno what you mean by ""inaccessable"""
25-06-2018T13:50:39,Bgrmystr2,"the site's already inaccessable, and that's the reason why the payment cycle won't go"
25-06-2018T13:50:53,Bgrmystr2,his page* I should say
25-06-2018T13:52:24,TheGamePlayer,Well gtg
25-06-2018T13:52:38,TheGamePlayer,Hope it all works out for him
25-06-2018T13:52:54,warhawk,"Well you said make them inaccessable, which I assume would be make people unable to see without a pledge."
25-06-2018T13:53:25,Bgrmystr2,yaeh but I don't think you realize how many images he has to go through on his patreon
25-06-2018T13:53:48,warhawk,"I'd hope there might be an ""all"" function"
25-06-2018T13:53:50,Bgrmystr2,"he's got several hundred images, perhaps closing in on a thousand individual posts."
25-06-2018T13:53:55,warhawk,but I didnt design the UI on that site
25-06-2018T13:54:03,Bgrmystr2,"as far as I've heard, there is not"
25-06-2018T13:54:08,Bgrmystr2,you have to do each post individually
25-06-2018T13:54:25,warhawk,"That way he clears the ""hold"" on his page"
25-06-2018T13:54:41,Bgrmystr2,yeah within 5 days? don't think so
25-06-2018T13:54:43,warhawk,"so he can make the july cycle, then walk back from there as able"
25-06-2018T13:55:28,Bgrmystr2,cuz patreon probably has to manually review it again after that
25-06-2018T14:14:57,Dadrobit,"Also, important to note: It's no Patreon just up and deciding that they don't like NSFW content, it's their financial providers PayPal and Braintree that are forcing their hands."
25-06-2018T14:15:02,Dadrobit,not*
25-06-2018T14:16:17,Dadrobit,"It's because ""payments for adult content are subject to a higher rate of charge-backs, and because of an aversion to the content itself among some payment processors"""
25-06-2018T14:17:04,Dadrobit,Patreon ~HAS~ to do something about adult content or there won't even be a Patreon.
25-06-2018T14:19:12,MallardDuckAvia,Just landed
25-06-2018T14:25:59,Bgrmystr2,"unfortunately, patreon already has the ability to agegate stuff behind 18+ accounts like deviantart and furaffinity do"
25-06-2018T14:26:03,Bgrmystr2,they chose not to
25-06-2018T14:26:20,Bgrmystr2,it would have the exact same effect
25-06-2018T14:45:24,Twokinds,Greetings
25-06-2018T14:45:42,Bgrmystr2,"hey tom, I take it you've noticed what happened to your patreon page"
25-06-2018T14:45:47,Bgrmystr2,:C
25-06-2018T14:45:57,Twokinds,"Yeah, I found out while I was coming home from the funeral."
25-06-2018T14:46:34,Bgrmystr2,you doin ok? :o
25-06-2018T14:46:40,Twokinds,It's been a long couple of days.
25-06-2018T14:46:50,Twokinds,"When it rains, it pours."
25-06-2018T14:46:57,Bgrmystr2,ain't that the truth. :/
25-06-2018T14:47:09,Bgrmystr2,what a terrible time for patreon to have jumped this on you
25-06-2018T14:47:28,Bgrmystr2,do you know what you're going to do?
25-06-2018T14:48:21,Bgrmystr2,"also, phoenix and I concluded that your patreon page was affected between 1:38am and 2:23am. eastern of course"
25-06-2018T14:48:29,Bgrmystr2,last night
25-06-2018T14:49:51,Twokinds,I've made an appeal.
25-06-2018T14:50:06,Twokinds,We'll see what they end up deciding.
25-06-2018T14:50:53,Bgrmystr2,"I hope it goes well. Chalo was talking about if it was down during the payment cycle, you may not get the money at the beginning of the month"
25-06-2018T14:51:00,Bgrmystr2,during the stream a week or two ago?
25-06-2018T14:51:33,Bgrmystr2,was a friday stream
25-06-2018T14:52:01,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-uneasy:
25-06-2018T14:52:07,Twokinds,"yeah, I don't like how they've chosen to handle this."
25-06-2018T14:52:23,Bgrmystr2,figured you wouldn't
25-06-2018T14:52:28,Twokinds,"Some forewarning would be appreciated, instead of surprising people with it at 3am."
25-06-2018T14:53:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Sorry about the loss
25-06-2018T14:54:08,Bgrmystr2,"yeh, I'm w/ kiwi. It's never easy."
25-06-2018T14:54:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"Unless they’re terrible at judgment, I don’t see them keeping the restriction"
25-06-2018T14:55:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve seen much more....bold artists
25-06-2018T14:55:25,Bgrmystr2,"well, if they don't keep the restriction, paypal and stuff won't be a direct source of income from them"
25-06-2018T14:55:50,Bgrmystr2,and that could potentially kill the site anyway
25-06-2018T14:56:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I liked Vat’s idea of an artist streaming/donation thing in one site
25-06-2018T14:56:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, Lost World is good"
25-06-2018T14:58:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"If the kids behind me would’ve known how to shut up, it’d be better"
25-06-2018T14:58:22,Twokinds,"I don't even use Paypal through the,."
25-06-2018T14:58:31,Twokinds,Through Patreon.
25-06-2018T14:58:59,Bgrmystr2,but some people probably would for a payment option
25-06-2018T14:59:04,Bgrmystr2,I know I would
25-06-2018T14:59:18,Twokinds,"At the end of the day, what is considered 'too sexy' will always be subjective."
25-06-2018T14:59:28,Bgrmystr2,yup.
25-06-2018T15:00:00,Bgrmystr2,"I think you're fine, but I dunno."
25-06-2018T15:00:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Sensitive people make the world less fun
25-06-2018T15:00:45,Bgrmystr2,eeeyup
25-06-2018T15:01:20,SpazztasticKiwi,YoU’rE gOnNa RuIn ThE kIdS
25-06-2018T15:01:55,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, the people trying to ""protect"" the kids are the reason kids are having such issues :/"
25-06-2018T15:01:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"Problem is, they’re the person instantly seeing something sexual"
25-06-2018T15:04:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Where is the line between protecting and coddling
25-06-2018T15:05:46,Bgrmystr2,..xD
25-06-2018T15:06:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Well I’m off to Incredibles
25-06-2018T15:08:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll be back in after
25-06-2018T15:10:29,Xexanoth,"well, guess no we can only hope whoever at patreon reviews it doesn't have a hate on for furry stuff..."
25-06-2018T15:10:32,Xexanoth,*now
25-06-2018T15:41:38,Mippy,What I don’t get is how Chris Chan doesn’t get shut down and Tom dose? At least Tom delivers.
25-06-2018T15:49:57,MallardDuckAvia,So what will the alternative be for the art now?
25-06-2018T16:00:33,Twokinds,"Worst comes to worse, I'll just have to label anything too risque as ""Patron Only"" so only those subscribed can see it. And then put those sketches up on Deviantart as well or something."
25-06-2018T16:01:12,Bgrmystr2,"deviantart downscales the quality though, :("
25-06-2018T16:01:19,Mippy,You’ll figure it out Tom
25-06-2018T16:01:25,Bgrmystr2,and don't they watermark it too?
25-06-2018T16:01:42,Mippy,Ugh! Back to work I guess.
25-06-2018T16:02:32,Xexanoth,better a downscaled version than none
25-06-2018T16:02:49,Bgrmystr2,"that's not really true xex, cuz it'll still be released"
25-06-2018T16:03:02,Bgrmystr2,"you could always set up a place on your website to host them, tom :o"
25-06-2018T16:03:16,Xexanoth,"besides for those who care im pretty sure people will still upload it to esix, which doesn't downscale"
25-06-2018T16:04:46,Bgrmystr2,3rd party sites though ehh
25-06-2018T16:05:19,Xexanoth,"but honestly, i think once patreon reviews it it's gonna go back up, usually with drawn stuff the bar is set pretty low(unless you straight up go explizit)"
25-06-2018T16:06:43,Twokinds,I hope they're reasonable.
25-06-2018T16:07:10,Bgrmystr2,same
25-06-2018T16:17:46,superpat50,How long ago did the patreon site go down for review?
25-06-2018T16:18:24,Bgrmystr2,between 1:38am and 2:23am eastern last night
25-06-2018T16:18:40,superpat50,Cause i just checked it up today and i got sad
25-06-2018T16:19:02,superpat50,:(
25-06-2018T16:20:00,superpat50,Thats sucks i hope they are fair with tom.
25-06-2018T16:26:22,Xexanoth,hmm for some reason comments on youtube don't load for me anymore....which ironicially improves the site.
25-06-2018T16:27:49,Dadrobit,"Back for a bit. Did they give you a list of changes that you specifically need to make, a vague lsiting of their policy, or any contact at all, Tom?"
25-06-2018T16:45:04,Combak,"So, Tom's Patreon is currently suspended because he labeled it SFW and they think some stuff is too risque?"
25-06-2018T16:45:30,Bgrmystr2,uh? Where did you get that?
25-06-2018T16:45:42,Bgrmystr2,cuz that couldn't be more backwards
25-06-2018T16:47:13,Combak,Some messages are deleted.
25-06-2018T16:47:26,Combak,"So, what's actually happening?"
25-06-2018T16:47:48,Combak,They're reviewing it to see if the NSFW label is needed?
25-06-2018T16:48:09,Bgrmystr2,"his patreon has been set to 18+ from the beginning. Basically, they're making anyone set as 18+ to have their content behind a paywall"
25-06-2018T16:48:12,Bgrmystr2,for the site
25-06-2018T16:48:26,Combak,I see.
25-06-2018T16:48:50,Bgrmystr2,"so if it's 18+, you HAVE to pay for it on their site, which is kinda dumb"
25-06-2018T16:49:58,Bgrmystr2,"basically, tom had his page 18+ just to be safe, and now it's either"
25-06-2018T16:50:11,Bgrmystr2,"he hides his posts behind the paywall, or makes it not 18+"
25-06-2018T16:50:31,Bgrmystr2,"he said he appealed it earlier, so we'll see."
25-06-2018T17:00:37,kts,so... basically we don't know if patreon will reopen the site be to the public... or by blocking 3/4 of the viewers... wtf!?
25-06-2018T17:09:54,Xexanoth,"nah, it would be that tom has to put everything that's ""mature"" as patreon only content(and then post it on deviantart for the non-patreons)"
25-06-2018T17:14:30,Bgrmystr2,"really not a fan of that, honestly. deviantart is a terrible site for uploading good quality images"
25-06-2018T17:29:56,kts,sign me up for that Bgrmystr2
25-06-2018T17:30:54,SpazztasticKiwi,So is the Patreon just not loading for some
25-06-2018T17:33:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"Or just some images, particularly if you’re not logged in/allowing 18+ stuff?"
25-06-2018T17:34:13,Vatruvius,It is unde review...oy does not load at all.
25-06-2018T17:34:24,Vatruvius,under* it*
25-06-2018T17:36:30,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s loading for me on mobile. No new posts are loading
25-06-2018T17:36:45,SpazztasticKiwi,But I also don’t know if there’s been one
25-06-2018T17:37:26,Bgrmystr2,the page is under review still kiwi
25-06-2018T17:37:31,Bgrmystr2,so it shouldn't load at all
25-06-2018T17:37:42,Bgrmystr2,maybe it's cuz the mobile page is buggy that it loads at all lol
25-06-2018T17:37:47,Bgrmystr2,xD
25-06-2018T17:37:58,Bgrmystr2,count yourself lucky I guess
25-06-2018T17:39:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah it’s loading but all that’s there are the old posts. Dunno what would happen if he tried to post something new
25-06-2018T17:40:47,Bgrmystr2,don't think he'd be able to
25-06-2018T17:40:53,Bgrmystr2,cuz page is under review
25-06-2018T17:41:00,Bgrmystr2,so he likely can't post anything new
25-06-2018T17:41:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"Well as it stands, surly it’ll be ok. There’s worse out there"
25-06-2018T17:41:51,Bgrmystr2,you say that.. :/
25-06-2018T17:41:52,SpazztasticKiwi,And I’m out of the Incredibles showing
25-06-2018T17:41:59,Bgrmystr2,but it never works out that way
25-06-2018T17:48:06,Xexanoth,often enough it does
25-06-2018T17:48:31,Bgrmystr2,maybe in movies xD
25-06-2018T17:51:39,Xexanoth,"just watch sports, things turn out all right in the end often enough there ^^"
25-06-2018T17:51:49,Xexanoth,depending on which side you're on
25-06-2018T17:51:54,Bgrmystr2,xD This ain't sports tho
25-06-2018T17:52:01,Bgrmystr2,and sports isn't really a great comparison
25-06-2018T17:52:05,Xexanoth,no shit XD
25-06-2018T17:52:41,Bgrmystr2,I wanna believe it'll be fine but honestly it's just bad news all around
25-06-2018T18:14:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"Speaking of stupid, my Picarto isn’t showing the users anymore"
25-06-2018T18:14:56,Xexanoth,???
25-06-2018T18:15:13,Xexanoth,"like in the user list, in chat or where?"
25-06-2018T18:15:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Yep
25-06-2018T18:15:27,SpazztasticKiwi,User list: gone
25-06-2018T18:15:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Whispers menu option is missing too
25-06-2018T18:16:18,SpazztasticKiwi,And it won’t let me whisper
25-06-2018T18:16:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Nm the menu is just at the top again
25-06-2018T18:17:08,Bgrmystr2,sounds like your client is being super buggy
25-06-2018T18:17:21,SpazztasticKiwi,But still no user list
25-06-2018T18:18:14,Xexanoth,tried restarting browser/app?
25-06-2018T18:19:01,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s always the first thing
25-06-2018T18:19:36,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s done this before
25-06-2018T18:21:06,Xexanoth,hmm just wait it out i guess :ptv-SteelwormHades:
25-06-2018T18:22:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Unfortunately

25-06-2018T19:17:52,GC1983,Anyone else notice Tom's patreon page is down?
25-06-2018T19:18:35,Bgrmystr2,yes we know
25-06-2018T19:53:12,Bgrmystr2,"welp, it's up now"
25-06-2018T19:53:17,Bgrmystr2,dunno how long ago but
25-06-2018T19:53:18,Bgrmystr2,it's up
25-06-2018T20:10:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Guys I’m not one to get ill at food workers but this boy was just snapping at his coworkers because his lunch order was wrong
25-06-2018T20:12:48,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
25-06-2018T20:15:41,SpazztasticKiwi,He complained and made them redo it at least four times
25-06-2018T20:16:30,SpazztasticKiwi,While being downright insulting to the griller
25-06-2018T20:20:42,Bgrmystr2,i wouldn't do that &gt;.&gt;
25-06-2018T20:21:08,Bgrmystr2,"I go back if I get something wrong, they add lettuce if I didn't want it, that kinda thing.."
25-06-2018T20:21:13,Bgrmystr2,or give me meat instead of beans
25-06-2018T20:21:27,Bgrmystr2,or give me cheese and chili instead of.. yknow.. not those.
25-06-2018T20:22:30,Bgrmystr2,"but I don't go and ridicule and cause a scene, I just ask for what I ordered :u"
25-06-2018T20:22:44,Bgrmystr2,and I thank them for fixing it
25-06-2018T20:24:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"I did make a comment that he should go fix it himself, especially since he seemed so bent on it being just so"
25-06-2018T20:25:07,totallynotTrace,so i just whent back to the patreon site and it auto redirected me to the twokinds/membership url but the page was blank like Tom never filled anything out for it
25-06-2018T20:25:38,Bgrmystr2,doesn't tell me anything about membership
25-06-2018T20:25:46,Bgrmystr2,dunno what you're looking at
25-06-2018T20:25:59,totallynotTrace,https://www.patreon.com/twokinds/memberships
25-06-2018T20:26:18,Bgrmystr2,stop using the membership link then? ._.
25-06-2018T20:26:23,Bgrmystr2,https://www.patreon.com/twokinds
25-06-2018T20:26:25,totallynotTrace,im not
25-06-2018T20:26:28,SpazztasticKiwi,It shows a new post from 4 hours ago went up
25-06-2018T20:26:45,totallynotTrace,yeah if i go to htat link it redirects to blank memberships
25-06-2018T20:26:50,Bgrmystr2,"it doesn't redirect to anywhere for me, it just goes to the page"
25-06-2018T20:26:55,totallynotTrace,weird
25-06-2018T20:27:01,totallynotTrace,anyway
25-06-2018T20:27:03,Bgrmystr2,I dunno. malware?
25-06-2018T20:27:29,totallynotTrace,it sounds like patreon doesnt have the worlds best programming
25-06-2018T20:27:47,totallynotTrace,do you mean malware on my end or patreons end?
25-06-2018T20:27:59,Bgrmystr2,malware on your end
25-06-2018T20:28:12,Bgrmystr2,cuz why else would a page redirect
25-06-2018T20:28:22,totallynotTrace,I think its my cache
25-06-2018T20:28:37,Bgrmystr2,"clear it, then, cuz I don't think patreon has a membership page"
25-06-2018T20:28:55,totallynotTrace,yeah it was added a few days ago
25-06-2018T20:28:57,Bgrmystr2,"I've logged in before, and it's never had membership in the link"
25-06-2018T20:28:58,Bgrmystr2,ahh
25-06-2018T20:28:59,Bgrmystr2,okay
25-06-2018T20:29:18,Bgrmystr2,"then I dunno maybe it's buggy, but dunno why it's being weird for you"
25-06-2018T20:30:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m on mobile and the link just sent me to a blank page
25-06-2018T20:30:39,totallynotTrace,ive been kinda just snooping in on the chat a lot today not saying much 90% of the time and it sounds like a lot of people have had an array of slightly different glitches with patreon
25-06-2018T20:31:16,totallynotTrace,kiwi are you using the mobile browser or the patreon app? just curious
25-06-2018T20:31:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"When I’m tapping links here, it goes to my web browser"
25-06-2018T20:31:41,SpazztasticKiwi,But I have the app
25-06-2018T20:32:55,totallynotTrace,"using chrome on my android phone, it also redirects me to the same blank membership url"
25-06-2018T20:33:10,totallynotTrace,so its probably not malware
25-06-2018T20:33:19,totallynotTrace,or at least not on my devices
25-06-2018T20:33:52,Bgrmystr2,maybe it's an app bug
25-06-2018T20:34:01,Bgrmystr2,cuz it's not happening on the pc client
25-06-2018T20:34:05,Bgrmystr2,least not for me
25-06-2018T20:35:03,Twokinds,Patreon is back.
25-06-2018T20:35:16,totallynotTrace,YAY
25-06-2018T20:35:56,totallynotTrace,nevermind still glitching
25-06-2018T20:36:12,totallynotTrace,but YAY it should work lol
25-06-2018T20:37:46,Bgrmystr2,"yeah it came back earlier, tom"
25-06-2018T20:37:58,unsteddyphoenix,"Was so sneaky of them, taking it down in the middle of the night lol"

25-06-2018T20:38:52,totallynotTrace,ok so it works on my phone :/
25-06-2018T20:39:16,Bgrmystr2,"gonna have to find a place to post the HD versions of it beyond patreon, cuz deviantart is not going to give the same quality"
25-06-2018T20:39:30,CrRAR,hallelujah!
25-06-2018T20:40:04,totallynotTrace,"yo tom, is going to patreon.com/twokinds supposed to redirect to patreon.com/twokinds/memberships ?"
25-06-2018T20:40:20,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh, and also im very sorry for you loss Tom."
25-06-2018T20:40:28,Bgrmystr2,"that's not something tom can do anything about, nottrace"
25-06-2018T20:40:31,Bgrmystr2,that's patreon
25-06-2018T20:40:33,Bgrmystr2,ask them.
25-06-2018T20:41:19,totallynotTrace,"idk for all I know it could be a setting that he set, im not a creator, I dont know the settings"
25-06-2018T20:41:26,Bgrmystr2,no
25-06-2018T20:41:34,Bgrmystr2,there's not going to be settings like that
25-06-2018T20:41:49,totallynotTrace,ill try tomarrow and hopefully the servers have stopped bugging out
25-06-2018T20:44:30,Twokinds,Thanks unsteddy
25-06-2018T20:45:12,Bgrmystr2,"are you gonna keep those patron-only posts, tom? Or are you going to continue the appeal so you can post everything publicly?"
25-06-2018T20:45:55,unsteddyphoenix,Like you said the timing for this is just awful.

25-06-2018T20:49:41,totallynotTrace,"art can reflect life. from the way I look at it, without life there cannot be art. The loss of life is something that will happen to everyone. I dont mean for that to sound dark, but rather, that art can then in turn reflect death."
25-06-2018T20:52:57,totallynotTrace,"Im sorry about your loss. Ive lost several people in the last 3 years. I tried writting about it in a creative way and it helped me understand my emotions somewhat. Im not an artist. But I hope that you (Tom, or really anyone reading this that is having"

25-06-2018T20:54:54,CrRAR,"Yeah unsteddy, Patreon's been pulling all sorts of odd stunts lately. Infinite's page was down for quite a bit too... like a week. It just got restored as well now."
25-06-2018T20:56:08,totallynotTrace,Ive heard you (Tom) say that the streams can sometimes stress you out. I am sure that if you take a few streams off to try to relax (relax doesnt sound like the right word but im not sure what to use) that the community will understand what you are going

25-06-2018T21:06:01,totallynotTrace,so patreon is youtube now? censoring all the things
25-06-2018T21:06:03,totallynotTrace,no
25-06-2018T21:06:07,Bgrmystr2,11 of the top 50 patreon pages are NSFW

25-06-2018T21:06:37,CrRAR,Are you a patron or have an account on there at all?
25-06-2018T21:06:37,Bgrmystr2,it could hurt them
25-06-2018T21:06:49,CrRAR,"yeah, it's bonkers."

25-06-2018T21:09:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d say it’s pretty understandable if streams are out for this week
25-06-2018T21:10:07,Bgrmystr2,"at this point, I don't think I'll ever support anyone via patreon. I'll do it directly."
25-06-2018T21:10:46,unsteddyphoenix,It is pretty annoying that they guy their way in this
25-06-2018T21:10:51,unsteddyphoenix,*get
25-06-2018T21:10:52,Bgrmystr2,I refuse to support a site that makes garbage decisions when a solution is sitting in front of their faces.

25-06-2018T21:11:32,totallynotTrace,Agreed

25-06-2018T21:11:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Tip Jar is a good name for a support website
25-06-2018T21:12:01,Bgrmystr2,patreon clearly doesn't allow people to run their patreon pages they way they choose to.
25-06-2018T21:12:16,Bgrmystr2,"gotta run it patreon's way, or gtfo"
25-06-2018T21:12:19,unsteddyphoenix,Someone make tip jar so we dont have to bow to these corporate overlords
25-06-2018T21:12:30,Bgrmystr2,I actually would if I knew a lick of coding
25-06-2018T21:12:36,CrRAR,There is still a tip jar on the site... it's kind of an easter egg.
25-06-2018T21:12:38,Bgrmystr2,"I don't, unfortunately"
25-06-2018T21:12:46,Bgrmystr2,and would take years to learn
25-06-2018T21:13:01,Bgrmystr2,but I legit would.
25-06-2018T21:13:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I once looked into coding out of curiosity
25-06-2018T21:13:10,unsteddyphoenix,A lick is about all I know

25-06-2018T21:32:22,unsteddyphoenix,Ive never owned a wii at all but I still know it from memory
25-06-2018T21:32:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Since Jigsaw technically doesn’t directly kill anyone
25-06-2018T21:32:32,unsteddyphoenix,Its SO catchy
25-06-2018T21:33:07,Twokinds,I've seen the first Saw movie
25-06-2018T21:33:10,Starz,jigsaw movies are really somthing i think i watched a part of 6 and i was like damn these movies harsh

25-06-2018T21:34:09,CrRAR,Darn nintendo and your clever imprinting!
25-06-2018T21:34:17,Twokinds,I haven't seen most horror movies.
25-06-2018T21:34:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Freddy vs Jason was a single movie
25-06-2018T21:34:35,unsteddyphoenix,I feel like only certain people like horror movies
25-06-2018T21:34:36,Twokinds,Yeah I mean I haven't seen any with either in it
25-06-2018T21:34:41,SpazztasticKiwi,They had never met before Freddy woke Jason up
25-06-2018T21:34:48,Starz,"yea ive never really seen many horror movies, only seen bits and peaces passing threw channels"
25-06-2018T21:35:06,Bgrmystr2,"they have individual freddy movies and jason movies though, kiwi"

25-06-2018T21:35:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"I like the Friday the 13th movies just fine, as well as the Nightmare on Elm Street"
25-06-2018T21:35:26,unsteddyphoenix,I liked Get Out though if that counts as horror
25-06-2018T21:35:47,SpazztasticKiwi,The idea behind Jason is much more appealing than Freddy’s
25-06-2018T21:35:53,CrRAR,Shawn of the Dead... best horror~
25-06-2018T21:35:58,Twokinds,lol
25-06-2018T21:36:06,Twokinds,Yeah I do love me some Shawn of the Dead
25-06-2018T21:36:09,SpazztasticKiwi,But Freddy’s more creative when he kills
25-06-2018T21:36:15,unsteddyphoenix,Oh yeah thats good stuff
25-06-2018T21:36:16,Starz,scream best movie 10/10

25-06-2018T21:36:27,SpazztasticKiwi,An odd thing to focus on but
25-06-2018T21:36:47,unsteddyphoenix,"you mean like, cause you pick up details you missed the firs time?"
25-06-2018T21:36:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, Freddy’s series has Kelen Lutz"
25-06-2018T21:36:56,CrRAR,The Predators are good stuff. Kinda more actiony though.
25-06-2018T21:37:01,SpazztasticKiwi,A favorite actor
25-06-2018T21:37:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Of mine anyway
25-06-2018T21:37:18,CrRAR,The first conjuring was pretty old school horror but good.
25-06-2018T21:37:32,unsteddyphoenix,I watched the latest predator I think? I enjoyed the twist villian
25-06-2018T21:37:38,CrRAR,haha

25-06-2018T21:38:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Conjuring doesn’t interest me weirdly enough
25-06-2018T21:38:53,Starz,last one to really get my heart pumping was the most reacent conjuring movie
25-06-2018T21:39:00,unsteddyphoenix,Ive never seen inidious but that sounds alrigh
25-06-2018T21:39:05,CrRAR,It is more simplistic the second one was dumb I think?
25-06-2018T21:39:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve always seen it as a bit...cliche
25-06-2018T21:39:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I did watch Ouiji though

25-06-2018T21:43:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I think he expected a scream.

25-06-2018T22:21:47,totallynotTrace,the older is 5 and highly manipulative. the younger is 3 but isnt really talking clearly yet but she has MUSCLE for a kid her age
25-06-2018T22:22:17,CrRAR,punish ALL for the dumbness of one

25-06-2018T22:25:25,totallynotTrace,on top
25-06-2018T22:25:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Girls can often be more brutal than boys
25-06-2018T22:26:28,totallynotTrace,i was going to put the older in time out for a minute but then her sister got revenge.
25-06-2018T22:26:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I had teachers in high school that would break up a guy fight but not a girl fight
25-06-2018T22:27:10,totallynotTrace,i dont want kids. theyre just....
25-06-2018T22:27:15,totallynotTrace,not my thing
25-06-2018T22:28:07,totallynotTrace,as for boys being more agressive as someone above said
25-06-2018T22:28:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I tell people that all the time and they’re response is “oh you’ll change your mind”
25-06-2018T22:28:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Which is rude
25-06-2018T22:29:18,totallynotTrace,"The older is more actively manipulative to the point of aggression, and the younger could probably win in a fight against the average 3 y.o. boy"
25-06-2018T22:30:54,totallynotTrace,"like, shes figured out stomping and kicking hurts more with shoes. if the older pisses her off, she will get her shoes. of course we know what it means when she gets her shoes so we stop her before violence happens"
25-06-2018T22:31:54,totallynotTrace,basically the older will just rip anything out of her hand to get what she wants. the younger has given the older many bruises as revenge
25-06-2018T22:33:10,totallynotTrace,"yeah kiwi, before my neices came along, my mom would say ""I cant wait for you to have kids"" and I found it annoying. now she hasnt told me that in 5 years. reason above^"

25-06-2018T22:35:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"Or because so many other people can, I should or I’m being selfish"
25-06-2018T22:35:31,totallynotTrace,"for me its more like ""yeah thats waht you want, but not what I want, you know that, stop telling me to"""
25-06-2018T22:35:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"It’s like, “no, it’s because it’s my uterus”"

25-06-2018T22:36:09,totallynotTrace,yup
25-06-2018T22:36:28,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s like the “You should smile” troupe

25-06-2018T22:40:41,totallynotTrace,yeah ive heard that too
25-06-2018T22:40:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I was working alone while my coworker was on lunch one night
25-06-2018T22:41:05,SpazztasticKiwi,This man comes up with his wife and two kids
25-06-2018T22:41:36,SpazztasticKiwi,IGNORES the service bell and the fact that I’m standing RIGHT THERE
25-06-2018T22:41:52,SpazztasticKiwi,and whistles and snaps for my attention
25-06-2018T22:42:06,totallynotTrace,oh god i hate those
25-06-2018T22:42:17,totallynotTrace,bitch im not a dog
25-06-2018T22:42:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Than wanted me to smile after I got him his food
25-06-2018T22:42:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"If looks could kill, he’d have been a grease stain on the floor"
25-06-2018T22:43:12,totallynotTrace,yup
25-06-2018T22:44:02,totallynotTrace,ive had some embarasing dining episodes with my grandfather
25-06-2018T22:45:45,totallynotTrace,"he seams to not think whistling, snapping, shouting across a restaurant (whatever the ambient noise level) to get a waiters attention is rude."
25-06-2018T22:48:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don’t care who you are, you do that around me and I’ll give you one warning"
25-06-2018T22:48:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Then I’m leaving
25-06-2018T22:48:28,SpazztasticKiwi,If I’m dining with you that is
25-06-2018T22:48:30,totallynotTrace,he was the one that invited me out to eat this one time and he both whistled and later snapped his fingers to get the waiter attention. I think the waiters and food were great and then he didnt feel like leaving a tip. so I left them a larger than normal
25-06-2018T22:49:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you’re at another table, I’ll snap and whistle at you"
25-06-2018T22:49:53,SpazztasticKiwi,You can use “ma’am” and “sir” and some patience. They are not your maids and they are not slaves
25-06-2018T22:49:55,totallynotTrace,tip and wrote an apology note bc at this point after the dual offense they were clearly hesitant to approach the table when we were around
25-06-2018T22:51:36,totallynotTrace,im generally really easy going at wait staff
25-06-2018T22:52:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a temper
25-06-2018T22:52:26,SpazztasticKiwi,But I know the service industry
25-06-2018T22:53:52,totallynotTrace,"if I need to get their attention ill generally wait untill they are walking within one or two table distance and say ""excuse me (maam, miss, sir, whatever word politely fits)"""
25-06-2018T22:54:43,totallynotTrace,"but like, lets say I order ummmmmm alll names of food just left my head"
25-06-2018T22:54:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Fish
25-06-2018T22:55:11,totallynotTrace,oh god take that back i definatly didnt order fish XD
25-06-2018T22:55:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Steak

25-06-2018T22:56:12,SpazztasticKiwi,And alfredo
25-06-2018T22:56:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Need more?
25-06-2018T22:57:54,totallynotTrace,"lets say I order a burger and the menue says it has onions, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, some sort of sauce and stuff, and its missing lettuce, im not even going to tell the waiter"
25-06-2018T22:59:54,totallynotTrace,now if its missing several of those I might ask if theyre sure I got the right order when they come around and ask how the food is (assuming this isnt fast food like mcdonalds)
25-06-2018T23:00:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you’re not terribly picky or allergic, it’s not a terribly big deal"
25-06-2018T23:00:24,totallynotTrace,nah
25-06-2018T23:00:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not picky but I do order the way I need to eat
25-06-2018T23:02:01,totallynotTrace,my mom has dietary restrictions (not technically alregies but its complicated as getting the wrong food could send her to the hospital) she commonly will ask to talk to the manager or head chef BEFORE ordering
25-06-2018T23:02:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m pretty constant on my orders at sit in restaurants
25-06-2018T23:03:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Fish is best because ordering well done steak doesn’t always seem to go over as well
25-06-2018T23:03:42,totallynotTrace,when i was a kid for some reason i would order steak n burgers well done
25-06-2018T23:04:41,Ordithus,Steak... well done... :ptv-grossedout:
25-06-2018T23:05:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Well excuse me for not being able to tolerate anything else
25-06-2018T23:05:35,totallynotTrace,"now i order medium to medium well depending on the quality of the establishment so that if its over cooked its less likely to be a hockey puck, and if its on the slightly less than what ive ordered, I am less likely to get sick"
25-06-2018T23:05:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I also can’t have a lot of bacon
25-06-2018T23:05:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"In fact, I’ve been told it’s better not to have it"
25-06-2018T23:06:44,totallynotTrace,I heared that theyve come out with a type of geneticaly modified kelp that when seerd it has the texture and taste of bacon
25-06-2018T23:06:54,Ordithus,Intriguing
25-06-2018T23:07:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Pass
25-06-2018T23:07:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"Not a big fan of kale, let alone kelp"
25-06-2018T23:07:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I haven’t had seaweed so
25-06-2018T23:07:40,Ordithus,"I dunno, if it tastes good and is healthy, why not?"
25-06-2018T23:07:48,totallynotTrace,agreed
25-06-2018T23:08:00,totallynotTrace,id try it
25-06-2018T23:08:24,totallynotTrace,ive never seen it though
25-06-2018T23:08:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Well I’ve had seaweed technically but it was mixed with other stuff
25-06-2018T23:09:01,Ordithus,Most food is worth at least a try.  Except that one dish made of pufferfish that might kill you if prepared slightly wrong.
25-06-2018T23:09:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah not terribly up for raw stuff
25-06-2018T23:09:33,totallynotTrace,yaeaaaaaaaaaah....... no puffy for me
25-06-2018T23:09:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Curious about oysters and sushi but
25-06-2018T23:09:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I also choose life
25-06-2018T23:11:00,totallynotTrace,"i generally stay away from fish as i have a 50/50 chance of being elergic to ummm whats that shelfish, theyre like oysters but not quite"
25-06-2018T23:11:30,totallynotTrace,my moms elergic and so are many other family members on her side and i havnt been tested for it
25-06-2018T23:11:42,totallynotTrace,scalops thats what they are
25-06-2018T23:12:26,totallynotTrace,and pretty much all seafood has in some way come in contact with their oil so my mom basicaly can have any seafood
25-06-2018T23:12:29,Ordithus,"allergic is the word.  Yeah, not worth the risk."
25-06-2018T23:12:39,SpazztasticKiwi,My grandpa was allergic to shellfish but my mom and her sister isn’t
25-06-2018T23:12:45,Ordithus,More for me.
25-06-2018T23:12:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Neither am I or my sister
25-06-2018T23:12:56,totallynotTrace,at some point ill go for a medical test
25-06-2018T23:13:01,Ordithus,I love sushi &lt;3
25-06-2018T23:13:11,totallynotTrace,i dont go near raw fish
25-06-2018T23:13:15,SpazztasticKiwi,And my dad was allergic to sweat bees. Neither one of us are
25-06-2018T23:13:43,totallynotTrace,sweat bees? do you mean honey bees?
25-06-2018T23:13:54,Ordithus,Sweat bees are an itty bitty bee
25-06-2018T23:14:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Pretty sure they’re not actually bees
25-06-2018T23:14:16,SpazztasticKiwi,More like some kind of fly
25-06-2018T23:14:20,Ordithus,"Even more adorable than a regular bee, though less stingy?  I think they are actually flies"
25-06-2018T23:14:37,Ordithus,Less annoying though
25-06-2018T23:15:09,totallynotTrace,IVE ALWAYS WONDERD WTF THESE THINGS ARE
25-06-2018T23:15:09,SpazztasticKiwi,They sting
25-06-2018T23:15:14,Ordithus,Yellowjackets are the spawn of Satan
25-06-2018T23:15:18,totallynotTrace,NO
25-06-2018T23:15:20,SpazztasticKiwi,How’s that less annoying
25-06-2018T23:15:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Anything that flys with a stinger is the spawn of Satan
25-06-2018T23:15:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless it makes honey
25-06-2018T23:15:51,Ordithus,I've only ever been stung by bumblebees
25-06-2018T23:15:59,totallynotTrace,"if you compare yellowjackets to white face hornets, yellow jackets are cute"
25-06-2018T23:16:11,Ordithus,True
25-06-2018T23:16:29,Ordithus,Hornets are level 7 demons
25-06-2018T23:16:44,SpazztasticKiwi,We had a nest of African hornets in our back door
25-06-2018T23:16:50,Ordithus,:ptv-nope:
25-06-2018T23:16:57,SpazztasticKiwi,My dad had the bright idea of banging on it
25-06-2018T23:17:02,totallynotTrace,ive never had a sweat bee sting or bite but i have a fair amount of them outside my house
25-06-2018T23:17:12,totallynotTrace,im not googling those
25-06-2018T23:17:18,totallynotTrace,unlike sweat bees
25-06-2018T23:17:24,SpazztasticKiwi,He thought pissing them off was funny
25-06-2018T23:17:41,SpazztasticKiwi,They couldn’t get in and we eventually extinguished them
25-06-2018T23:17:54,SpazztasticKiwi,But still. The f
25-06-2018T23:18:06,totallynotTrace,I have a white face hornet nest stuck to the eves of my house not far from my window
25-06-2018T23:18:26,totallynotTrace,they kicked out the bats
25-06-2018T23:19:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Hornets are the size of two thumbs and have the attitude of a white woman that wants the manager
25-06-2018T23:19:34,SpazztasticKiwi,There will be casualties
25-06-2018T23:20:00,totallynotTrace,i measured one when it was walking around my window screen and it was 1.5 inches long by roughly half inch wide
25-06-2018T23:20:01,Ordithus,"A few years ago I went for a bike ride.  I took a breather out on the trail, when something bright caught my eye... a giant hornet, probably 4 inches long.  I hit 40 on a pedal bike."
25-06-2018T23:20:12,Ordithus,lol kiwi
25-06-2018T23:20:32,totallynotTrace,JESUS ORD
25-06-2018T23:20:40,Ordithus,THIS WAS IN MINNESOTA
25-06-2018T23:20:49,totallynotTrace,I can do 40 downhill
25-06-2018T23:20:59,totallynotTrace,and it has to be a HILL
25-06-2018T23:21:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I do not fuck with hornets
25-06-2018T23:21:21,Ordithus,"Adrenaline, man.  What else"
25-06-2018T23:21:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I will make the sign of the cross and sprint the other direction
25-06-2018T23:22:16,totallynotTrace,my gps told me i hit a top speed of 15 when i was on flat ground and saw a bear apear right next to me
25-06-2018T23:23:21,Ordithus,The bear didn't want to eat you.
25-06-2018T23:23:57,totallynotTrace,"no, but i didnt know that till i turned around 500 feet later"
25-06-2018T23:24:38,Ordithus,:ptv-shock::ctwokinds-renirawr:
25-06-2018T23:24:43,totallynotTrace,but this was about 4 days after they closed a section of the trail for a bear chasing a biker for about a quarter mile
25-06-2018T23:24:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I would rather hug Jason
25-06-2018T23:25:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Voorhees
25-06-2018T23:25:03,totallynotTrace,the 911 call made the news
25-06-2018T23:25:18,Ordithus,Bears are fast
25-06-2018T23:25:41,totallynotTrace,yeah im pretty sure dude was on a ultra light bike
25-06-2018T23:26:29,totallynotTrace,meanwhile im on steel mtn bike with slightly rusted gears n chain
25-06-2018T23:28:36,Ordithus,Bears are cool to see up close at the zoo.
25-06-2018T23:29:02,Ordithus,"I've seen them in town, but never at any point where I would be ""vulnerable"""
25-06-2018T23:29:10,totallynotTrace,I see em up close at least once a month
25-06-2018T23:29:21,Ordithus,Seeing bear scat on a hiking trail though... disconcerting
25-06-2018T23:29:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Though speaking of Jason - Tom you got a favorite horror movie
25-06-2018T23:29:33,totallynotTrace,I live on the edge of a state forrest
25-06-2018T23:29:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Or preference at least
25-06-2018T23:30:06,Ordithus,Moose.  Another scary animal
25-06-2018T23:30:24,totallynotTrace,for me seing bear scat on a bike path just means everything is normal :/
25-06-2018T23:30:35,totallynotTrace,yeah
25-06-2018T23:30:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Those things are always bigger than you think they are
25-06-2018T23:31:02,totallynotTrace,hit those with a car n DAAAAYYYUMMM
25-06-2018T23:31:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Moose may eat grass but they’re awful big for it
25-06-2018T23:31:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"Basically, damn nature you scary"
25-06-2018T23:31:49,totallynotTrace,car: totaled driver:probably dead Moose: might be ok
25-06-2018T23:31:53,Ordithus,They can be very chill.  But you don't really know when they aren't.
25-06-2018T23:32:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Rut
25-06-2018T23:32:14,Ordithus,"Nah, it's the mommas"
25-06-2018T23:32:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Know the season and stay away
25-06-2018T23:33:09,Ordithus,"I've been within touching distance, no issue.  But this oen that was across a meadow... she scared me still"
25-06-2018T23:34:29,totallynotTrace,ive been the passenger in a car going around a blind hairpin and there was a good size moose taking up the entire right lane. luckily I could see through the trees that the drive wouldnt have been looking through and was able to yell stop
25-06-2018T23:34:42,Ordithus,dang
25-06-2018T23:35:03,totallynotTrace,front bumper came about 5 feet from it
25-06-2018T23:36:02,totallynotTrace,"it stopped for a sec, looked at the car, then slowly stepped over the gaurd rail and crossed the river to our right"
25-06-2018T23:36:33,Ordithus,"It was all like ""I'm a moose, moose, gonna moose"""
25-06-2018T23:37:12,totallynotTrace,"but year if I had been looking anywhere else like at my phone or any other landscape, the car definatly would have hit it"
25-06-2018T23:37:22,totallynotTrace,ya
25-06-2018T23:38:11,totallynotTrace,speaking of wildlife
25-06-2018T23:38:32,totallynotTrace,coyottes just started howling outside

25-06-2018T23:41:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Sounds like a car that won’t start
25-06-2018T23:42:57,totallynotTrace,sometimes the coyotees will try to mimic the barred owl that is in the same area of the woods so it sounds like theyre laaughing
25-06-2018T23:43:34,totallynotTrace,this is what the coyottees sound like but there is generally about half as many
25-06-2018T23:43:36,totallynotTrace,https://youtu.be/mER3MoMa_qM
25-06-2018T23:43:50,totallynotTrace,unless they try to mimic the owl
