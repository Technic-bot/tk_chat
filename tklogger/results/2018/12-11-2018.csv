12-11-2018T00:04:39,SpazztasticKiwi,ü¶É wrong pudge birb
12-11-2018T00:04:48,Ordithus,It was a long day.  Missed the whole stream.  Between that and yesterday's little preview... :ctwokinds-sleepoverA:
12-11-2018T00:05:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Don‚Äôt worry. I got to pop in right as Tom‚Äôs mom summoned him cause she locked the keys in the car
12-11-2018T00:06:10,Ordithus,Is Tom good at lockpicking or something?
12-11-2018T00:06:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I dunno
12-11-2018T00:07:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Depending on the car model and year there can be many ways to break in
12-11-2018T00:07:28,Ordithus,Some have codes
12-11-2018T00:07:42,Ordithus,"Others, like a 93 Dodge Caravan, only require a coat hanger."
12-11-2018T00:07:53,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúOpen or I‚Äôll send you to the junk yard‚Äù
12-11-2018T00:08:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Locks: *click*

12-11-2018T00:08:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,there will be a rube shoe in the firewall separating the cabin and the motor.  Get a stick with a 90 degree bend on the end and a budy and fangganle your way
12-11-2018T00:08:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,thats who I had to break into my 99 sunfire
12-11-2018T00:08:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,how not who
12-11-2018T00:09:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve only ever climbed in from the sunroof
12-11-2018T00:09:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I do have small enough hands that I can sometimes get though a rolled down window
12-11-2018T00:10:55,SpazztasticKiwi,We have two keys for the main car. And carry a spare for my grandma‚Äôs
12-11-2018T00:11:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Always good to have a spare

12-11-2018T00:12:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Quick - you‚Äôre locked in your car and you have only a hammer to escape. What do you do
12-11-2018T00:12:45,Ordithus,Open the door
12-11-2018T00:12:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,kneecap myself

12-11-2018T00:13:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
12-11-2018T00:13:24,Ordithus,There was the one time when the door would not open.
12-11-2018T00:13:48,Ordithus,Fortunately the window was already broken :upside_down:
12-11-2018T00:14:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve seen a guy lock his truck with a busted window

12-11-2018T00:50:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I just bathed myself in soda
12-11-2018T00:51:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,why?
12-11-2018T00:51:33,Twokinds,That doesn't sound health
12-11-2018T00:51:55,Ordithus,That's a strange way to have a bubble bath
12-11-2018T00:52:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Because I like the feeling of soda up my nos-IT WAS A BLOODY ACCIDENT
12-11-2018T00:52:26,Dadrobit,"Wait, was it blood or soda?"
12-11-2018T00:52:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,carbonated soda
12-11-2018T00:52:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"Since you can‚Äôt hear, imagine a very heavy sigh"
12-11-2018T00:53:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,le sigh
12-11-2018T00:54:01,Mippy,:ctwokinds-clovischuckle: bloody soda
12-11-2018T00:54:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"Down the shirt, on the legs, went slightly up the nose and Bagheera just sits there"

12-11-2018T00:55:05,Mippy,Cats are something else
12-11-2018T00:56:42,SpazztasticKiwi,At least I missed my phone
12-11-2018T00:57:18,Dadrobit,"btw, for those interested, Spyro is actually awesome!"
12-11-2018T00:57:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"Now obviously I‚Äôve already been dabbing at it to get it all off, but it makes me happy I keep a towel near the bed"
12-11-2018T00:57:40,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:
12-11-2018T00:57:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Yes. Spyro good
12-11-2018T00:58:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Jacksepticeye played a series on the old version
12-11-2018T00:58:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I expect him to do the reboot
12-11-2018T01:00:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"I enjoyed watching Jack and Mark play the Crash reboot. And since my sister played those games back then, I showed her too"
12-11-2018T01:00:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark kept calling things by the wrong name and she just :ctwokinds-flomad: ‚ÄúNO.‚Äù
12-11-2018T01:02:07,Mippy,NO
12-11-2018T01:02:36,Mippy,:ctwokinds-flomad:
12-11-2018T01:02:42,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúGotta collect those apples‚Äù he says
12-11-2018T01:02:51,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúTHEYRE WAMPANOAG FRUIT!‚Äù
12-11-2018T01:02:58,SpazztasticKiwi,WAMPA
12-11-2018T01:03:12,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúHe can‚Äôt hear you‚Äù
12-11-2018T01:03:34,Mippy,To be fair...I always called them apples too üçé üçè
12-11-2018T01:04:02,SpazztasticKiwi,He also got Coco mixed up with Crash‚Äôs gf
12-11-2018T01:04:16,Dadrobit,that's problematic
12-11-2018T01:04:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Though he‚Äôd never played the game before so I found it entertaining
12-11-2018T01:04:35,Mippy,XD I have to finish watching that let‚Äôs play
12-11-2018T01:05:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Mini breakdown on the rope bridge level. Just a warning
12-11-2018T01:05:15,Mippy,I never seem to make it through the longer ones
12-11-2018T01:05:32,SpazztasticKiwi,How‚Äôs the Until Dawn one going
12-11-2018T01:06:02,Mippy,Ummm....it‚Äôs not :ctwokinds-sadtrace2:
12-11-2018T01:06:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Well Mark‚Äôs also played Until Dawn. I personally have watched 6 youtubers play it
12-11-2018T01:07:08,Mippy,Maybe I‚Äôll just binge some Mark while I work on my paper tomorrow
12-11-2018T01:07:19,SpazztasticKiwi,But part 13 has a meltdown of beautiful proportions
12-11-2018T01:07:53,SpazztasticKiwi,And I have the most ‚Äúflattering‚Äù screen shot of Ethan playing it
12-11-2018T01:07:59,Mippy,Oh my gosh! Anything on the level of the chair throwing in Getting Over It?
12-11-2018T01:08:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Do you want to go ahead and see the snippet?
12-11-2018T01:08:33,Mippy,Ethan is cute....:ctwokinds-daydreamingkat:
12-11-2018T01:08:37,SpazztasticKiwi,He doesn‚Äôt throw a chair but there‚Äôs yelling
12-11-2018T01:08:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Agonized yelling
12-11-2018T01:09:35,Mippy,Not really in a place where I can have my volume on. Otherwise I would.
12-11-2018T01:09:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I tweeted the Ethan picture. Here: https://twitter.com/spazztastickiwi/status/982698151151796224?s=21
12-11-2018T01:11:04,Mippy,Oh my god! At first I confused because all I saw was the monster. Then I noticed Ethan in the corner :ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
12-11-2018T01:12:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Twins
12-11-2018T01:13:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"When I first came across that frame, I felt like I‚Äôd found gold. And I showed it to a few people at PAX last year. They agreed"
12-11-2018T01:13:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Not sure if Ethan‚Äôs seen it despite the tag though. Though I‚Äôm also not surprised
12-11-2018T01:14:14,DarthRexKing,Windegos are no joke. o3o
12-11-2018T01:14:50,Mippy,I know about the folklore...pretty scary things they are
12-11-2018T01:15:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Just don‚Äôt eat your dead sister in the abandoned mines and you‚Äôll be fine
12-11-2018T01:15:49,Mippy,(Had a big spooky folklore obsession in middle school)
12-11-2018T01:16:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I still have a folklore obsession what are you talking about
12-11-2018T01:16:51,SpazztasticKiwi,And you know there‚Äôs a specific way the Hannah wendigo kills most of the characters
12-11-2018T01:17:07,SpazztasticKiwi,And there‚Äôs also a deeper story to Josh
12-11-2018T01:17:12,Dadrobit,\o/ First boss down
12-11-2018T01:17:18,Mippy,I still read new books And stuff when I find them...
12-11-2018T01:17:38,Mippy,Yay! Kick em dead Dad
12-11-2018T01:17:48,SpazztasticKiwi,You gonna burn through the game tonight?
12-11-2018T01:18:21,Dadrobit,Maybe the first one. It's pretty straightforward iirc.
12-11-2018T01:18:47,Dadrobit,"Rescue dragons and eggs, collect gems, beat the bosses."
12-11-2018T01:18:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn‚Äôt play Crash or Spyro but I did join in with CTR and Mario racing
12-11-2018T01:19:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"Buckle me up, I‚Äôll go round and round"
12-11-2018T01:19:04,Dadrobit,The second and third get more in depth stories.
12-11-2018T01:19:41,Mippy,I played Crash and Spyro a bit when we were able to rent a PlayStation
12-11-2018T01:20:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I FORGOT MY MEDS
12-11-2018T01:20:53,Mippy,:ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake: Get the meds!
12-11-2018T01:21:08,Dadrobit,Crash and Spyro were some of my first PS games ever. After we finally got bored of spending countless hours with the demo disc that came with the console lol.
12-11-2018T01:21:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Pill taken. Crisis averted
12-11-2018T01:21:41,Mippy,Those demo disks were fantabulas
12-11-2018T01:21:48,SpazztasticKiwi,The main game I ever played was Soms
12-11-2018T01:21:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Sims
12-11-2018T01:21:59,SpazztasticKiwi,And I tortured most of them
12-11-2018T01:22:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I prefer Soms
12-11-2018T01:23:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"Literally every neighborhood I had in Sims, I made a legit ‚Äúgraveyard‚Äù and killed sims on the plot for the sole purpose of collecting gravestones and ghosts"
12-11-2018T01:23:14,Mippy,Hmmm...I use to play that Duck Hunt/ Mario cartridge a lot ...after that video games were kind of a rarity
12-11-2018T01:23:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I had a game like Duck Hunt called Chicken Shot. Same thing
12-11-2018T01:23:51,Dadrobit,"Mmm, first games were on the Sega Genesis. But it got stolen..."
12-11-2018T01:24:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Bangbangbangbang clickclickclick(reload) bangbangbangbang
12-11-2018T01:24:19,SpazztasticKiwi,And repeat
12-11-2018T01:24:27,Mippy,I played a lot of Hungry Hungry Hippos though
12-11-2018T01:24:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I liked uno pretty well
12-11-2018T01:25:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Family played it when dad was still alive
12-11-2018T01:25:08,SpazztasticKiwi,So looong ago
12-11-2018T01:25:50,Mippy,Well...that went in a weird direction...ummmm....

12-11-2018T06:25:33,ThingsAreMoving,there were several people guessing it

12-11-2018T22:29:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Means I got Kiwi and Bagheera for into my 30s
12-11-2018T22:29:11,Ordithus,Did you adopt her without knowing how old she was?
12-11-2018T22:29:26,Twokinds,I got her as a kitten.
12-11-2018T22:29:32,Twokinds,I just can't remember when that was.
12-11-2018T22:29:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Do you remember how old you were
12-11-2018T22:29:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Or Mark? Any kind of age marker?
12-11-2018T22:30:03,Ordithus,"Kiwi, once you're past 22, it doesn't matter anymore"
12-11-2018T22:30:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Wat
12-11-2018T22:30:35,Ordithus,"I turned 30.  Was like, ""huh, weird.  I'm old but don't feel old."""
12-11-2018T22:30:38,unsteddyphoenix,Things happened...at some point.
12-11-2018T22:31:02,Dadrobit,They just keep happening. Goodness knows I've tried stopping them.
12-11-2018T22:31:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"As in, if I end up getting married. If I have kids. They‚Äôll be there when that happens"
12-11-2018T22:34:58,CrRAR,nevar forget
12-11-2018T22:35:08,Ordithus,Hm?  What?
12-11-2018T22:36:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I know Kiwi‚Äôs birthday for sure but Bagheera‚Äôs is an estimate
12-11-2018T22:36:52,Twokinds,I'm pretty sure I was in college when I got her.
12-11-2018T22:37:09,Twokinds,So... between 2008 and 2011
12-11-2018T22:37:19,Twokinds,I want to say it was 2009
12-11-2018T22:37:34,unsteddyphoenix,college is a blur huh
12-11-2018T22:37:37,SpazztasticKiwi,You could probably go with that
12-11-2018T22:37:41,unsteddyphoenix,"Too much partying, probably"
12-11-2018T22:37:46,Twokinds,Haha

12-11-2018T22:38:29,Dadrobit,Can conirm. Too much partying s'why I dropped out the first time I attempted college.
12-11-2018T22:38:32,SpazztasticKiwi,The very definition of antisocial going to a college party
12-11-2018T22:38:41,Dadrobit,confirm*
12-11-2018T22:38:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I guess this means she‚Äôs about 9 or 10
12-11-2018T22:38:57,unsteddyphoenix,"Partying up in video games, that is :sunglasses:"
12-11-2018T22:39:02,SpazztasticKiwi,You can also tell age by the teeth
12-11-2018T22:39:05,Dadrobit,"Yeah, that too."
12-11-2018T22:39:13,unsteddyphoenix,And if you count the rings on her tail...
12-11-2018T22:39:14,Ordithus,Best kind of party
12-11-2018T22:39:17,SpazztasticKiwi,But I can probably guess you don‚Äôt know how to do that
12-11-2018T22:39:57,Ordithus,Have you tried asking her/
