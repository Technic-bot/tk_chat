06-05-2018T00:00:03,unsteddyphoenix,Like purposefully-ripped jeans
06-05-2018T00:00:51,Vatruvius,It would be cool because TK fans get the reference but others would be non the wiser.
06-05-2018T00:01:23,Vatruvius,But Kat daki would be a plus.
06-05-2018T00:02:51,CrimsonHelsing,"eh, dakis, idk. personally never saw much appeal to them. Also on that note, I've noticed suggestors asking for ones of a lot of the cast ,':\"
06-05-2018T00:03:24,unsteddyphoenix,eah me neither
06-05-2018T00:03:33,unsteddyphoenix,:upside_down:

06-05-2018T00:04:00,NightMeaty22,üôÉ¬ø
06-05-2018T00:05:00,CrimsonHelsing,"honestly I don't know whether to feel like they're asking for more of the same, or embrace the ideas - period. or, uh, something."
06-05-2018T00:06:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I fell asleep. What happened?
06-05-2018T00:06:07,unsteddyphoenix,I hear theyre great back support?
06-05-2018T00:07:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I make sugar and peanut butter cookies most often
06-05-2018T00:08:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"My sister likes them, so they don‚Äôt last long usually"
06-05-2018T00:08:17,CrimsonHelsing,*shrug*
06-05-2018T00:08:25,Bgrmystr2,"Lol Crimson, Dakimakura are just pillows with images of characters on them."
06-05-2018T00:08:39,Bgrmystr2,it's no more or less pointless than figures or posters or whatever
06-05-2018T00:08:41,CrimsonHelsing,"heh, story of me and ma's choc-chip cookies @SpazztasticKiwi"
06-05-2018T00:08:54,CrimsonHelsing,"exactly, Bgr"
06-05-2018T00:09:04,Bgrmystr2,"well, pillowcases* actually but yeah"
06-05-2018T00:09:31,Bgrmystr2,"they're not any more or less special, but people like those just like they like figures or posters or wallscrolls or whatever"
06-05-2018T00:09:43,NightMeaty22,Well i'm gonna get some sleep cya
06-05-2018T00:09:47,Bgrmystr2,gnight yo
06-05-2018T00:09:49,NightMeaty22,:ptv-sleepy:
06-05-2018T00:09:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Kitty wants some of my ice cream
06-05-2018T00:10:00,CrimsonHelsing,"really, I still can't understand... *something* about them, as suggestions"
06-05-2018T00:10:08,CrimsonHelsing,but you have a point
06-05-2018T00:10:37,CrimsonHelsing,guess it's a difference of taste in what is demanded to be seen really
06-05-2018T00:10:47,CrimsonHelsing,"me, I like scenery and such"
06-05-2018T00:11:06,CrimsonHelsing,not like Bob Ross background and environment focus when I say scenery
06-05-2018T00:11:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll go for a good waterfall
06-05-2018T00:11:39,unsteddyphoenix,Like a bedroom with a pillow in it?
06-05-2018T00:11:44,CrimsonHelsing,"interactions, characters, moments for one or more person or creature, etc"
06-05-2018T00:12:21,unsteddyphoenix,I hate that
06-05-2018T00:12:24,unsteddyphoenix,More pillows
06-05-2018T00:12:34,CrimsonHelsing,"stuff I push for that, some of them I confess, I dread never seeing, ever. but I digress. and lol unsteddy xD"
06-05-2018T00:13:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm a sucker for those ‚Äúartsy‚Äù pictures of people with good lighting and such
06-05-2018T00:13:20,CrimsonHelsing,"indeed, they can be amazing"
06-05-2018T00:13:28,CrimsonHelsing,Tom's past work is testament to it
06-05-2018T00:13:48,SpazztasticKiwi,One reason I‚Äôll take a picture of someone I don‚Äôt know
06-05-2018T00:14:14,CrimsonHelsing,oh like a photographer you mean?
06-05-2018T00:14:37,SpazztasticKiwi,With my phone though. I don‚Äôt have a camera
06-05-2018T00:15:26,SpazztasticKiwi,But there‚Äôs some people that I‚Äôll be with and I‚Äôll see a good moment but they don‚Äôt like pictures so I don‚Äôt take it
06-05-2018T00:17:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"And on the concept of a TK apron, I only wear one when cooking something that might pop at me, not much of an apron person otherwise"
06-05-2018T00:17:44,CrimsonHelsing,"hm, makes sense"
06-05-2018T00:18:44,SpazztasticKiwi,And something to keep the hair from getting in the way
06-05-2018T00:20:29,Vatruvius,"I never wear aprons, but if there was a TK one I would wear aprons in the kitchen."
06-05-2018T00:21:31,SpazztasticKiwi,1. make TK aprons a thing 2. every regular in chat gets one 3. we all met and have cookout
06-05-2018T00:22:13,unsteddyphoenix,I'd have to wear a second apron to protect the tk one
06-05-2018T00:22:33,unsteddyphoenix,Could get the apron signed...:thinking:
06-05-2018T00:22:42,SpazztasticKiwi,If you‚Äôre not a disaster in the kitchen you won‚Äôt need another
06-05-2018T00:22:45,Vatruvius,I am down Kiwi.
06-05-2018T00:22:51,Vatruvius,Will find the true TK chef.
06-05-2018T00:23:11,unsteddyphoenix,"I mean, most of the time you dont need one at all"
06-05-2018T00:23:12,Vatruvius,Winner gets the apron signed.
06-05-2018T00:23:16,unsteddyphoenix,"But, SOMETIMES"
06-05-2018T00:23:17,Vatruvius,"There, competition."
06-05-2018T00:23:23,unsteddyphoenix,"Lol, a cook off?"
06-05-2018T00:23:45,Vatruvius,"Yeah, did you read Kiwi's 3 step comment?"
06-05-2018T00:24:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Nah Tom‚Äôs not invited. He‚Äôs not social :ctwokinds-smug:
06-05-2018T00:25:31,Vatruvius,Cook off is in front of Tom's house.
06-05-2018T00:25:44,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôd go over well
06-05-2018T00:25:58,Vatruvius,"When looking at his house all the shutters are down, maybe you see one slide go up as if someone is peaking."
06-05-2018T00:26:06,SpazztasticKiwi,How Fast Can the Cops Appear 101
06-05-2018T00:26:23,Vatruvius,Well...I mean...free food for Tom.
06-05-2018T00:26:36,SpazztasticKiwi,From people he‚Äôs never seen before
06-05-2018T00:26:49,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs how you get murdered
06-05-2018T00:27:06,Vatruvius,Then we all go in masks that look like our avatars. Problem solved!
06-05-2018T00:27:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Great. I‚Äôll stick a flower over my face
06-05-2018T00:28:12,Vatruvius,I have to get a tiger mask.
06-05-2018T00:29:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll just go full flower girl
06-05-2018T00:29:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"Flower crown, floral dress, shoes with flower decals"
06-05-2018T00:29:51,Vatruvius,Now you are thinking.
06-05-2018T00:30:18,unsteddyphoenix,Thats like only one step up from horse girl in danger level
06-05-2018T00:30:20,Vatruvius,It is either that or timed with ComicCon when Tom has a booth.
06-05-2018T00:30:20,SpazztasticKiwi,So much pink you‚Äôll spot me from miles off
06-05-2018T00:30:21,Bgrmystr2,"blonde hair, witch hat and outfit, I'm down for this."
06-05-2018T00:30:30,Bgrmystr2,I'm game.
06-05-2018T00:31:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a witch dress. Not sure it‚Äôll fit you though
06-05-2018T00:31:11,Vatruvius,"A cosplay, TK apron, cook off outside Tom's house. I think he is so excited he just doesn't know what to say."
06-05-2018T00:31:17,Vatruvius,lol
06-05-2018T00:31:18,unsteddyphoenix,As if Bgr doesnt have his own witch dresses
06-05-2018T00:31:19,unsteddyphoenix,Cmon
06-05-2018T00:31:34,Vatruvius,Ouch.
06-05-2018T00:31:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Or he‚Äôs looking up how to get a restraining order on multiple people at the same time
06-05-2018T00:31:53,Vatruvius,Nah...he wouldn't do that.
06-05-2018T00:31:53,unsteddyphoenix,gotta go for the combo
06-05-2018T00:33:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"You know, my towns gonna have a festival around the last weekend this month"
06-05-2018T00:34:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Right when MomoCon is
06-05-2018T00:34:12,Vatruvius,What is the festival?
06-05-2018T00:35:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"Carnival shows up and people set of booths selling antique knives, coins, even swords, along with clothes, video games and more"
06-05-2018T00:35:59,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs also this one guy who shows every year selling these terrifying taser/pepper spray/flashlight combo monsters
06-05-2018T00:36:27,Vatruvius,So there is no official name for this thing?
06-05-2018T00:36:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Mayfest
06-05-2018T00:37:42,Vatruvius,Ah.
06-05-2018T00:37:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve always been tempted to get a taser flashlight thing but I don‚Äôt want to try to turn on the light and set off the taser instead
06-05-2018T00:38:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Also saw the sword and life guy selling something that looked like Freddy Kruger‚Äôs glove and Jason‚Äôs Machete
06-05-2018T00:38:52,SpazztasticKiwi,*knife
06-05-2018T00:38:56,Vatruvius,"If it is not a cheap thing, then it would not be an easy mistake to make."
06-05-2018T00:39:31,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs not cheap. The thing‚Äôs heavy
06-05-2018T00:40:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Thankfully he also keeps them out of little hands‚Äô reach
06-05-2018T00:40:46,Vatruvius,As he should.
06-05-2018T00:40:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Heavy enough to knock someone out of the tasing doesn‚Äôt work
06-05-2018T00:40:55,SpazztasticKiwi,*if
06-05-2018T00:41:53,Vatruvius,How big is this thing?
06-05-2018T00:42:34,SpazztasticKiwi,About the size of just a regular emergency flashlight
06-05-2018T00:43:41,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs also quite a few jewelry sellers. They see a woman walk by it‚Äôs ‚Äúwanna look around?‚Äù
06-05-2018T00:44:44,Vatruvius,"""If I wanted to look at your jewelry I would have stopped and looked!"""
06-05-2018T00:44:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Exactly
06-05-2018T00:45:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I have enough as it is. Likely getting rid of some when I can
06-05-2018T00:45:36,Vatruvius,"That is an interesting problem you have. With my sister and mom, it is a stop at every jewelry stant."
06-05-2018T00:45:39,Vatruvius,stand*
06-05-2018T00:46:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don‚Äôt wear earrings unless it‚Äôs something important, and I generally only wear my dad‚Äôs necklace"
06-05-2018T00:46:19,SpazztasticKiwi,And most bracelets annoy me
06-05-2018T00:46:52,Vatruvius,Would you describe yourself to be a more conservative person?
06-05-2018T00:47:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"I have a pearl one that‚Äôs really pretty but if you‚Äôve ever worn something with something like pearls around your wrist, you‚Äôll know why I like it in looks only"
06-05-2018T00:47:24,SpazztasticKiwi,And yeah I‚Äôd say so
06-05-2018T00:48:07,Vatruvius,You mean like hair pulling?
06-05-2018T00:48:49,Vatruvius,"My sister likes to look cute all the time so a lot of jewelry and makeup. I do not mind that mentality, but I am a conservative person so I understand your point of view."
06-05-2018T00:48:49,SpazztasticKiwi,It can get in the hair but it‚Äôs more like it digs into the wrist when you sit your hand down on a table
06-05-2018T00:49:20,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs a lot of bracelets that just fall off my wrist anyway
06-05-2018T00:50:16,Vatruvius,"I see. I have a pearl necklace once when I was really young. Like one of those Hawaiian ones, always pulled my hairs on my neck."
06-05-2018T00:50:25,Vatruvius,had*
06-05-2018T00:50:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Pearl necklaces are a no unless they‚Äôre made a certain way just for that reason
06-05-2018T00:51:13,SpazztasticKiwi,If I want my hair removed I‚Äôll do it myself thanks
06-05-2018T00:51:38,Vatruvius,"I am not talking about your head hair, but just the little hairs."
06-05-2018T00:51:45,Vatruvius,Still painful either way.
06-05-2018T00:52:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"As for rings, I have one of my dad‚Äôs that I wear. Looks enough like an engagement ring from a distance that it fools enough people"
06-05-2018T00:53:59,Vatruvius,"Clever. Can avoid unwanted attention with that, unless that is what they are looking for. But could also means you avoid attention that you may have wanted."
06-05-2018T00:54:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Can‚Äôt understand ‚Äúnot interested‚Äù? How about ‚Äútaken‚Äù?
06-05-2018T00:54:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Usually a pretty good last resort
06-05-2018T00:54:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Had to tell one guy I had a wife to get him to give up
06-05-2018T00:55:37,Vatruvius,Wow.
06-05-2018T00:55:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Desperate‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
06-05-2018T00:56:09,Vatruvius,Desperate or his ego needs to be resized.
06-05-2018T00:57:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"Thing is, plenty of them don‚Äôt notice the ring until I say I‚Äôm married or engaged. Then the eyes dart straight for the finger"
06-05-2018T00:58:25,Vatruvius,"Probably because they assumed at 21 you are not married, and they are right."
06-05-2018T00:59:05,SpazztasticKiwi,How many of them do you think have actually asked my age? The number may surprise you
06-05-2018T00:59:43,Vatruvius,How many guys are talking about here?
06-05-2018T00:59:48,Vatruvius,That go up to you?
06-05-2018T01:00:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"It‚Äôs not very often, and most of the time it‚Äôs rather brief when it does. Major instances? About 4 or 5"
06-05-2018T01:01:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Less extreme and easier to handle can loosely be once a month or so
06-05-2018T01:01:35,Vatruvius,"I would have assumed 10%, but you said I would have been surprised so 35%?"
06-05-2018T01:01:53,SpazztasticKiwi,No guy has asked my age
06-05-2018T01:02:10,Vatruvius,:ptv-shock:
06-05-2018T01:02:12,SpazztasticKiwi,One asked if I was over 18. That was it
06-05-2018T01:02:35,SpazztasticKiwi,His next question ‚Äúmarried? Have a boyfriend?‚Äù
06-05-2018T01:02:48,Bgrmystr2,"For the record, I do not actually own any witch dresses yet. Cosplays are rather expensive. :C"
06-05-2018T01:02:51,Vatruvius,"How about, just talk?"
06-05-2018T01:03:20,Vatruvius,It is as if they follow this cookie cutter guide of trying to get into relationships.
06-05-2018T01:03:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"There‚Äôs a guy that used to come into my work every day. Spanish guy, real nice with an pretty thick accent"
06-05-2018T01:03:47,Vatruvius,No! Treat them as a person not an object you memorized some rule book online to get.
06-05-2018T01:04:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"I rather liked seeing him until he a conversation came up that I knew some Spanish, then it was ‚ÄúAre you married?‚Äù"
06-05-2018T01:05:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"Not terribly creepy, but a little weird. And he kinda looked a bit old to me. 35ish maybe but who knows"
06-05-2018T01:05:46,Vatruvius,"Like, you now some Spanish? Perfect, let's get married tonight!"
06-05-2018T01:06:05,Vatruvius,I would call 15 years older than you old.
06-05-2018T01:06:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I haven‚Äôt seen him or the family group he normally came in with in quite a bit lately
06-05-2018T01:07:45,SpazztasticKiwi,The most major problem I seem to run into really is staring
06-05-2018T01:08:00,Vatruvius,Staring?
06-05-2018T01:08:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm doing whatever and the guy‚Äôs just üëÄ
06-05-2018T01:09:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"Say hi if you‚Äôre going to, I understand nerves if you like me but you‚Äôre creeping me out just gawking"
06-05-2018T01:09:18,Vatruvius,I read that as star ing not stare ing
06-05-2018T01:09:27,Vatruvius,lol
06-05-2018T01:09:42,Vatruvius,In some cases hi is the best you can do then everything freezes.
06-05-2018T01:10:05,Vatruvius,I have not had that sort of feeling in many years.
06-05-2018T01:10:34,Vatruvius,"Still shy and timid, but ogling would not happen."
06-05-2018T01:10:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I smiled at one guy that I caught watching me and I think I broke him. Looked away and busied himself
06-05-2018T01:11:07,Vatruvius,That is hard.
06-05-2018T01:11:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm pretty sure he was just gazing off into space and didn‚Äôt know he was looking directly at someone though
06-05-2018T01:11:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I do that all the time
06-05-2018T01:12:19,SpazztasticKiwi,My least favorite part are the one liners. There‚Äôs cheesy and cute and then there‚Äôs creepy and too fast
06-05-2018T01:12:26,Vatruvius,I get lost in thought a lot actually. I have mastered making it look like I have not notice them noticing me looking their way. So when I snap out of my thought I don't look like as if I was purposely looking at them because I wasn't.
06-05-2018T01:13:01,Vatruvius,"That sounded creepy, but that is not what it is at all."
06-05-2018T01:13:07,Vatruvius,Let me just clarify.
06-05-2018T01:13:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I got it
06-05-2018T01:14:07,Vatruvius,I do not think I could do one liners. I would have a hard enough time just approaching and saying hello. After names and a conversation really starts it is all smooth sailing. It is the before part that is hard.
06-05-2018T01:14:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"Seems to me a lot of people don‚Äôt realize that just because I‚Äôm looking directly at my phone, it doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt still see you or are aware of you looking"
06-05-2018T01:14:44,Vatruvius,"Peripheral vision people, everyone has it."
06-05-2018T01:14:48,SpazztasticKiwi,My main problem is I don‚Äôt like people behind me
06-05-2018T01:15:08,Vatruvius,"Back against a wall, problem solved."
06-05-2018T01:15:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"I stand in elevators with my back in the corner, close to the door as possible"
06-05-2018T01:16:09,Vatruvius,"I think being in an elevator with any stranger is just awkward, no matter what."
06-05-2018T01:16:31,Vatruvius,"But I do not hide in the corner, maybe hug the wall or something to keep distance."
06-05-2018T01:16:53,SpazztasticKiwi,My phone is my friend. Make it look like you‚Äôre in a conversation with someone else and there‚Äôs little chance of a conversation
06-05-2018T01:16:56,Vatruvius,"When an elevator is crowded with strangers, everyone does the awkward shuffle. It is hilarious."
06-05-2018T01:17:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Or put in headphones
06-05-2018T01:17:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not rude or antisocial - just cautious
06-05-2018T01:17:39,Vatruvius,Or just pull up this chat and actually get involved in a conversation.
06-05-2018T01:18:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I did that a few times at PAX. Mainly just checking in though
06-05-2018T01:19:54,Vatruvius,I occasionally just pull up my phone as if I got a notification when things are awkward.
06-05-2018T01:23:53,CrimsonHelsing,"is Tom on? I couldn't help but notice something I want to speak to him personally about. I'm sorry if this is a bother right now, I can check back later."
06-05-2018T01:24:52,Vatruvius,He is on.
06-05-2018T01:24:59,Vatruvius,He was speaking half an hour ago.
06-05-2018T01:25:05,Vatruvius,I am sure he will respond.
06-05-2018T01:25:11,Vatruvius,Usually does.
06-05-2018T01:25:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless he‚Äôs distracted
06-05-2018T01:26:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Might take him a minute
06-05-2018T01:27:18,CrimsonHelsing,"I just want to talk to him personally. not like face to face, just between us. what's his email? something-gmail?"
06-05-2018T01:27:50,Vatruvius,Umm...
06-05-2018T01:30:19,Vatruvius,I do not know his email nor do I see it anywhere obvious like the website or anything.
06-05-2018T01:31:32,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/umxU9Nc.jpg Time for the oven.
06-05-2018T01:31:47,KiTA,Why do you want to speak to Tom personally?
06-05-2018T01:31:49,KiTA,he has an email someplace
06-05-2018T01:31:59,Dadrobit,"Stove is dirty as heck, pls ignore."
06-05-2018T01:32:05,CrimsonHelsing,"my reasons are my own, about something he said earlier"
06-05-2018T01:32:05,Vatruvius,I did stumble upon Tom's bio on Keenspot. You still studying radiation therapy Tom?
06-05-2018T01:32:29,KiTA,I see
06-05-2018T01:32:40,KiTA,"Well, sending him a DM on DA might work"
06-05-2018T01:32:42,Vatruvius,I could not find his email KiTA
06-05-2018T01:32:47,unsteddyphoenix,Ooo nice pie nice pie~
06-05-2018T01:32:53,CrimsonHelsing,"no actually, Vatruvius, he quit that pursuit"
06-05-2018T01:33:03,CrimsonHelsing,"years ago, I think"
06-05-2018T01:33:15,Vatruvius,I figured. Just Twokinds now?
06-05-2018T01:33:21,Vatruvius,For the most part.
06-05-2018T01:34:19,Vatruvius,"The bio says when he was 29 so, at most almost 2 years ago?"
06-05-2018T01:35:57,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs a sexy pie ü•ß
06-05-2018T01:37:13,CrimsonHelsing,eh? xD
06-05-2018T01:38:04,unsteddyphoenix,Very attractive pie
06-05-2018T01:38:09,Bgrmystr2,Just send him a PM on patreon maybe
06-05-2018T01:38:29,Bgrmystr2,"his inbox on DA has like 10,000 unread messages or somecrap"
06-05-2018T01:39:51,Vatruvius,wow.
06-05-2018T01:40:13,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I asked him almost two years ago and he said back then it had been years. He's just left it up as ""a kind of social experiment."""
06-05-2018T01:40:21,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno if it's that exact amount, but I remember it being a bullshit amount, like, several thousands xD"
06-05-2018T01:40:38,Dadrobit,And thank you. Hoping the pie turns out well.
06-05-2018T01:40:50,Dadrobit,The spoon lick test tells me it's on the right track.
06-05-2018T01:41:17,Dadrobit,Now I gotta go make some whipped cream.
06-05-2018T01:41:21,Bgrmystr2,what kininda pie
06-05-2018T01:41:22,SpazztasticKiwi,You must offer a sacrifice to the oven so it doesn‚Äôt burn it
06-05-2018T01:41:24,Bgrmystr2,kinda*
06-05-2018T01:41:35,Dadrobit,Butterscotch Cinnamon Pie.
06-05-2018T01:41:52,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
06-05-2018T01:41:52,CrimsonHelsing,mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
06-05-2018T01:42:14,unsteddyphoenix,Hoo~ that sounds cool
06-05-2018T01:42:18,Bgrmystr2,"not gonna lie, I have no idea what that would taste like, but I usually like butterscotch, and cinnamon is not bad either"
06-05-2018T01:42:26,unsteddyphoenix,Neither
06-05-2018T01:42:33,unsteddyphoenix,We only really have savory pies here.
06-05-2018T01:42:51,Bgrmystr2,Only pies I've ever liked are pecan pie and cheesecake.
06-05-2018T01:43:49,CrimsonHelsing,"dunno where I'd get all the ingredients for B-scotch c-mon pie really. straight-up butterscotch idk, is it homemade or can it be found in supermarkets depending on region?"
06-05-2018T01:43:56,CrimsonHelsing,thought I'd get that out for the heck of it
06-05-2018T01:45:08,Dadrobit,"Home made. It's just egg yolk, butter, corn starch, brown sugar, milk, heavy cream."
06-05-2018T01:45:18,Dadrobit,I think that's about it.
06-05-2018T01:45:19,Bgrmystr2,"Is this about right, Dadro? http://cookfiction.com/recipes/butterscotch-cinnamon-pie.html"
06-05-2018T01:45:32,Bgrmystr2,I can't really find anything that isn't that recipe xD
06-05-2018T01:45:51,Dadrobit,"Oh, and I forgot cinnamon in my original list."
06-05-2018T01:45:52,Bgrmystr2,like 3-4 pages of results are literally different pages of that same recipe over and over
06-05-2018T01:45:59,unsteddyphoenix,I was gonna say...
06-05-2018T01:46:01,Dadrobit,"But yep, that's about the sie of it."
06-05-2018T01:46:19,CrimsonHelsing,ahh
06-05-2018T01:46:28,Bgrmystr2,"alright cool, might give it a try."
06-05-2018T01:46:35,Dadrobit,size*
06-05-2018T01:47:14,CrimsonHelsing,sounds like a crazy amount of ingredients for a simple-recipe cooking oriented person like me xD
06-05-2018T01:47:33,Dadrobit,It's actually super duper simple really.
06-05-2018T01:48:01,CrimsonHelsing,"yea you're prolly right, just might take getting used to xD"
06-05-2018T01:48:05,Vatruvius,Most recipes are super easy.
06-05-2018T01:49:59,Dadrobit,Mix the brown sugar/corn starch/eggs/cinnamon. Brown the butter. Mix the milk and cream and simmer it. Simmer the brown sugar w/ water. Mix it all at med heat stirring nonstop.
06-05-2018T01:50:04,Dadrobit,Done.
06-05-2018T01:50:31,Dadrobit,Pour it in the pie crust when it's consistency is hella goupy.
06-05-2018T01:50:43,Dadrobit,30 mins at 350F.
06-05-2018T01:50:52,Dadrobit,Sit for 30 minute.
06-05-2018T01:50:58,BadFoMo,I think I'll try to take a nap now. Good night.
06-05-2018T01:51:01,Dadrobit,Then Fridge until chilled.
06-05-2018T01:51:01,Vatruvius,"That is pretty good. Since I am celiac and need things to be gluten free, making the pie crust is more complicated than making that."
06-05-2018T01:51:15,CrimsonHelsing,"talk to you sooner or later, hopefully, BadFoMo"
06-05-2018T01:51:17,Dadrobit,"Night, FoMo."
06-05-2018T01:51:17,Vatruvius,Good night FoMo!
06-05-2018T02:07:24,Dadrobit,":/ Forgot to pick up butterscotch liquor for the whipped cream. Gonna substitute maple extract, hoping for the best."
06-05-2018T02:08:29,unsteddyphoenix,Oh goodness
06-05-2018T02:08:50,unsteddyphoenix,I hope everything works out!
06-05-2018T02:12:48,Dadrobit,The cream is just gonna be part Canadian is all hopefully.
06-05-2018T02:13:18,unsteddyphoenix,noone must know its dark secret...
06-05-2018T02:18:01,Vatruvius,"SCP: Operation Descent seems like a pretty scary game...add that to my list of games to not play. :ballot_box_with_check: Alright, got that done."
06-05-2018T02:22:18,Dadrobit,I may have maken a disproportionate amount of cream for the pie. https://i.imgur.com/OvXold0.jpg
06-05-2018T02:22:28,Dadrobit,Sorry about that.
06-05-2018T02:23:02,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-zenshocked: It's canadian side is shining through!
06-05-2018T02:23:19,Vatruvius,"That is just a shame, I guess you gotta eat the extra."
06-05-2018T02:23:34,Dadrobit,I taste tested it. It's actually amazing.
06-05-2018T02:23:57,Dadrobit,Definitely going to get an A on my final now.
06-05-2018T02:24:11,Dadrobit,Unless the professors are lactose intolerant....
06-05-2018T02:26:06,Vatruvius,Tsk...something you should have thought about.
06-05-2018T02:26:16,SpazztasticKiwi,How inconsiderate of you
06-05-2018T02:26:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Instant F
06-05-2018T02:26:41,unsteddyphoenix,Eh they already graded him
06-05-2018T02:27:56,Dadrobit,"Also, I'm torn on the whole Kat Apron idea from earlier."
06-05-2018T02:28:09,Dadrobit,"One the one hand, it sounds adorable."
06-05-2018T02:28:10,Twokinds,Torn like the heart.
06-05-2018T02:28:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I hope so. It‚Äôs an essential organ
06-05-2018T02:28:28,Dadrobit,"On the other, I'm already set. https://i.imgur.com/HA4ahj8.jpg"
06-05-2018T02:28:37,Twokinds,Haha
06-05-2018T02:28:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Especially for your enemies
06-05-2018T02:29:02,unsteddyphoenix,...yeah. That seems like something youd own
06-05-2018T02:29:26,unsteddyphoenix,(:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:)
06-05-2018T02:29:56,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs not you or the kitchen. Its the weather that‚Äôs hot
06-05-2018T02:30:11,unsteddyphoenix,Rude!
06-05-2018T02:30:11,Vatruvius,lol
06-05-2018T02:30:16,unsteddyphoenix,It could ALWAYS be all 3
06-05-2018T02:30:32,Dadrobit,Ty unsteddy.
06-05-2018T02:30:52,Dadrobit,"Also, that is why I do my baking at night when it's nice and cool out."
06-05-2018T02:31:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Nothing more normal than baking a cake at 2 am
06-05-2018T02:31:20,Dadrobit,12:30am Currently 83F.
06-05-2018T02:31:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Close enough
06-05-2018T02:31:36,Vatruvius,"Since I do not own an apron like that, not any apron actually, a TK apron will be much appreciated. :D"
06-05-2018T02:32:05,SpazztasticKiwi,My kind of apron: ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs dinner: eat it or starve‚Äù
06-05-2018T02:32:30,Dadrobit,"Not gonna lie, still giggly about that ""seems like something youd own"" comment. Made my night."
06-05-2018T02:32:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I could see you with a kiss the cook apron
06-05-2018T02:33:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera‚Äôs being very affectionate
06-05-2018T02:33:29,unsteddyphoenix,I have a weird competitive urge to get a comedic apron now...
06-05-2018T02:34:19,unsteddyphoenix,Clearly trying to compete with the kitten
06-05-2018T02:34:35,SpazztasticKiwi,He wanted food
06-05-2018T02:34:37,Bgrmystr2,lol that apron
06-05-2018T02:36:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Plot twist: the kitchen is what‚Äôs making you hot
06-05-2018T02:37:40,unsteddyphoenix,Because men cooking is attractive? :thinking:
06-05-2018T02:37:50,unsteddyphoenix,I get that
06-05-2018T02:38:36,Dadrobit,This shade tho.
06-05-2018T02:39:12,unsteddyphoenix,Dont listen to the bullies :/
06-05-2018T02:40:17,Dadrobit,"Oh, speaking of, I did end up going back to my project."
06-05-2018T02:41:01,Dadrobit,"Fixed the metal/wood clang, and dulled some of the shimmer of the blades coming through too harshly."
06-05-2018T02:41:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I meant that ovens give off heat and can warm you up as you work but yeah
06-05-2018T02:41:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll join a guy in the kitchen if he wants to cook something
06-05-2018T02:41:42,unsteddyphoenix,Nice~ \o/
06-05-2018T02:41:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Don‚Äôt take that the wrong way
06-05-2018T02:42:10,unsteddyphoenix,What way?
06-05-2018T02:42:24,Dadrobit,0.o
06-05-2018T02:42:27,SpazztasticKiwi,If you don‚Äôt see it there‚Äôs no need to point it out
06-05-2018T02:42:43,Dadrobit,Ohhhhhhhhh~
06-05-2018T02:43:34,unsteddyphoenix,:thinking:
06-05-2018T02:44:29,Bgrmystr2,"I see what you tried to not do there, Kiwi :ptv-snicker:"
06-05-2018T02:44:48,Dadrobit,"Actually, looking at the forecast, it seems we broke a record today. 106F."
06-05-2018T02:45:02,Dadrobit,Thought it felt a bit warm out.
06-05-2018T02:45:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Yep and I just made it worse :ctwokinds-keifacepalm:
06-05-2018T02:45:42,Dadrobit,41.1r for you Celsius folks.

06-05-2018T02:47:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Think cool thoughts
06-05-2018T02:47:07,Dadrobit,Lots of water.
06-05-2018T02:47:16,Bgrmystr2,That's about how hot it gets here during the summer.
06-05-2018T02:47:20,Vatruvius,And very high electricity bills.
06-05-2018T02:47:21,Bgrmystr2,10xF
06-05-2018T02:47:21,SpazztasticKiwi,And stay inside

06-05-2018T02:47:36,SpazztasticKiwi,We know
06-05-2018T02:47:39,Dadrobit,lol
06-05-2018T02:47:47,Bgrmystr2,Problem being on the gulf coast.. it's hot AND muggy.. the heat sticks to you
06-05-2018T02:47:49,SpazztasticKiwi,We know that very well
06-05-2018T02:47:49,Vatruvius,You stay inside weather it is hot or not Tom.
06-05-2018T02:47:55,Bgrmystr2,it's fuckin terribad

06-05-2018T02:48:02,Dadrobit,Swamp cooler helps keep the bills low so long as the humidity isn't bad.

06-05-2018T02:48:13,unsteddyphoenix,For that...thing i also do...

06-05-2018T02:48:24,CrimsonHelsing,"aw c'mon, leave the guy alone xP"
06-05-2018T02:48:26,Dadrobit,"But when it's 120 and humid. Fuck it, stay inside and turn the AC on."
06-05-2018T02:48:46,Vatruvius,"Yes, poor Tom, he just wants to draw his curry characters in peace without the sun."
06-05-2018T02:48:59,Dadrobit,"Curry, are you saying they're hot?"
06-05-2018T02:49:01,Bgrmystr2,"""his curry characters"" So.. Tom draws foor people now?"

06-05-2018T02:49:11,Twokinds,I could really go for some curry right now.
06-05-2018T02:49:18,Vatruvius,*facepalm*
06-05-2018T02:49:23,Dadrobit,Vat wants to eat them up tbh.
06-05-2018T02:49:33,unsteddyphoenix,I need more cute curry in my life.
06-05-2018T02:49:41,Bgrmystr2,haha
06-05-2018T02:50:04,Vatruvius,This just went into all sorts of bad directions.
06-05-2018T02:50:09,Twokinds,I wonder if anyone's ever drawn an anthro curry.
06-05-2018T02:50:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Whoa there
06-05-2018T02:50:29,Dadrobit,Yes
06-05-2018T02:50:30,Vatruvius,"You can be the first Tom, just think of the fame and recognition!"
06-05-2018T02:50:42,unsteddyphoenix,"I imagine it'd be like a slime girl, but delicious"
06-05-2018T02:51:00,unsteddyphoenix,He's already going to be the first crab-anthro character.
06-05-2018T02:51:03,Twokinds,Slime girls aren't delicious? They look like jello.
06-05-2018T02:51:14,Vatruvius,"Thing is, anthro currys have very, very short life spans around people."
06-05-2018T02:51:26,unsteddyphoenix,"""slime"" doesnt garner the best image"
06-05-2018T02:51:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you want to use the ‚ÄúI could eat you up‚Äù line, sure"
06-05-2018T02:51:29,Vatruvius,Tis why they are anti-social.
06-05-2018T02:51:48,unsteddyphoenix,I just htink of Nickelodeon slime
06-05-2018T02:51:57,Dadrobit,:/ Never understood a lot of the appeal of slime girls. Seems.... Messy.
06-05-2018T02:52:14,iliar,Hm. Chiken curru counts as antro curru?
06-05-2018T02:52:23,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, it's always messy, really"
06-05-2018T02:52:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Girls aren‚Äôt messy. That‚Äôs a myth
06-05-2018T02:52:47,Dadrobit,"Yeah, but you can manage that to an extent normally."
06-05-2018T02:53:04,Vatruvius,Rice makes clean-up and containment easy.
06-05-2018T02:53:09,unsteddyphoenix,^
06-05-2018T02:53:36,unsteddyphoenix,You should shower afterwards in any case so.
06-05-2018T02:53:42,Dadrobit,"Like, it's the difference between a couple wet wipes, and mandatory showers I'd think."
06-05-2018T02:53:56,Bgrmystr2,"Okay, thanks firefox for crashing like a shit"
06-05-2018T02:54:07,Dadrobit,But you don't always have time for a shower.
06-05-2018T02:54:12,Bgrmystr2,"also, I looked it up but cannot find any anthro curry on booru websites"
06-05-2018T02:54:17,Bgrmystr2,"I tried, tom."
06-05-2018T02:54:29,unsteddyphoenix,You should shower!
06-05-2018T02:54:32,Bgrmystr2,I have failed you. :ptv-sad:
06-05-2018T02:54:40,Dadrobit,"Same, bgr. Though i did find an adorable mini-Barroth soaking in a curry."
06-05-2018T02:55:14,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe the next logical step in from Katini is Kurry...
06-05-2018T02:55:17,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:

06-05-2018T02:55:22,Bgrmystr2,ahahahhaha
06-05-2018T02:55:31,SpazztasticKiwi,It ever occur to you guys that not everything has to be remade with boobs
06-05-2018T02:55:35,Bgrmystr2,well okay then
06-05-2018T02:55:37,Dadrobit,shudders
06-05-2018T02:55:40,unsteddyphoenix,I dont understand the question
06-05-2018T02:55:41,Vatruvius,I think I am going to get off and continue my 8th read of the comic. Catch you all later today for the sketch stream part 2 if you can make it.
06-05-2018T02:55:46,Vatruvius,:ptv-greetings:
06-05-2018T02:55:50,Bgrmystr2,"Hey, it doesn't matter to me Kiwi. I only searched to see if it existed"
06-05-2018T02:55:54,unsteddyphoenix,o/
06-05-2018T02:55:55,Bgrmystr2,not that I suggest making it
06-05-2018T02:55:59,CrimsonHelsing,8th read? hot damn ^w^
06-05-2018T02:56:02,Dadrobit,"If she's sitting in a curry the same way she was in the martini, that's gonna be painful..."
06-05-2018T02:56:03,Bgrmystr2,"(which I am not against, mind you)"
06-05-2018T02:56:16,Dadrobit,o/ Vat
06-05-2018T02:56:23,Bgrmystr2,gnight Vatru
06-05-2018T02:56:25,unsteddyphoenix,PainfuL? What kind of spiked-curry are you eating
06-05-2018T02:56:52,Vatruvius,I did not say everything had to have boobs. I did not even specify a gender with the whole curry thing so...
06-05-2018T02:56:57,Dadrobit,Curry is generally spicy. And she has.... Vulnerable bits that are normally not very well guarded.
06-05-2018T02:57:07,unsteddyphoenix,"Ahh, I see."
06-05-2018T02:57:13,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-wondering: Oh, Dadro lol. I was gonna say. Somethin somethin chopsticks."
06-05-2018T02:57:21,Bgrmystr2,but I like your answer better.
06-05-2018T02:57:22,unsteddyphoenix,"Ok, bottom half rice-side"
06-05-2018T02:57:48,Vatruvius,"Anyway, bye again!"
06-05-2018T02:57:54,Bgrmystr2,gnight :u
06-05-2018T02:57:55,Dadrobit,"Cya, enjoy."
06-05-2018T02:58:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Y‚Äôall make me want some take out rn
06-05-2018T03:00:16,Dadrobit,I was lazy earlier. Instant Mac n Cheese.
06-05-2018T03:00:19,unsteddyphoenix,:curry::curry::curry::curry:
06-05-2018T03:00:33,Dadrobit,w/ a bit of Macayo's Taco Sauce.
06-05-2018T03:01:43,unsteddyphoenix,mexican again huh...
06-05-2018T03:02:04,unsteddyphoenix,If that wall gets built you gonna starve
06-05-2018T03:02:08,Dadrobit,Lol
06-05-2018T03:02:39,Dadrobit,We already have a wall. But it's more like a picket fence.
06-05-2018T03:03:24,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs the thought that counts
06-05-2018T03:04:10,Dadrobit,"Back in the day, we used to ride our dirtbikes over the border to pick up stuff like fireworks for camping trips. It was fun, but that was almost 20 years ago now."
06-05-2018T03:04:32,unsteddyphoenix,...
06-05-2018T03:05:08,unsteddyphoenix,this answers probably just going to upset me but...how old were you riding those dirtbikes
06-05-2018T03:05:13,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/oxSC2B2.jpg Holes like this all through it.
06-05-2018T03:05:20,Dadrobit,"Like, 4?"
06-05-2018T03:05:29,Dadrobit,That's around when I started.
06-05-2018T03:05:55,Dadrobit,Last time I actually rode into Mexico was around 15.
06-05-2018T03:05:59,unsteddyphoenix,He had dirtbikes when he was 4...
06-05-2018T03:06:17,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it was a little 50cc pit bike."
06-05-2018T03:06:50,Dadrobit,Got more scars on my body from that bike...
06-05-2018T03:07:08,unsteddyphoenix,im so jealous!
06-05-2018T03:07:17,Dadrobit,I might have a picture of it somewhere...
06-05-2018T03:08:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Chicks dig scars. Got that going for you
06-05-2018T03:11:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Tiny kitten mewth. I‚Äôll be back
06-05-2018T03:16:28,Dadrobit,Found it! https://i.imgur.com/s8bBmfN.jpg
06-05-2018T03:16:48,Dadrobit,"In the bottom one, I was the itty bitty one on the quad w/ my egg donor."
06-05-2018T03:17:35,unsteddyphoenix,Thats so badass~
06-05-2018T03:17:41,unsteddyphoenix,With only some risk of fucking up your spine
06-05-2018T03:17:44,Dadrobit,Top was a couple years later when I was riding on my own finally on the bike previously ridden by my sister.
06-05-2018T03:20:28,Dadrobit,"Speaking of, found an old album I made that has both my first and last bike in it!"

06-05-2018T03:22:22,Simba007,When is the next stream?
06-05-2018T03:22:40,Dadrobit,Guaranteed stream next Friday
06-05-2018T03:23:39,Bgrmystr2,Tomorrow is likely
06-05-2018T03:23:47,Bgrmystr2,to finish the sketches from Sunday
06-05-2018T03:23:54,unsteddyphoenix,"Man, I want to break 6 vertebra too..."
06-05-2018T03:23:57,Bgrmystr2,Depending on what day you are atm :u
06-05-2018T03:23:59,Dadrobit,:/ Damn I want to ride again now...
06-05-2018T03:24:03,Simba007,Thank you
06-05-2018T03:24:18,Vatruvius,Tom still here&gt;
06-05-2018T03:24:22,Vatruvius,?
06-05-2018T03:24:26,Bgrmystr2,"Tom didn't finish Sun, so Mon prolly. But no promises :U"
06-05-2018T03:24:31,Bgrmystr2,he may do it off-screen
06-05-2018T03:24:35,Dadrobit,I miss that CR500 so much.
06-05-2018T03:24:50,Dadrobit,It was such a nice bike.
06-05-2018T03:24:57,Vatruvius,I think I may have just got that phishing ad some of you said you got.
06-05-2018T03:25:47,unsteddyphoenix,Well send an email to keenspot
06-05-2018T03:25:53,Dadrobit,keenspot@keenspot.com
06-05-2018T03:25:56,unsteddyphoenix,The more people complain the faster they'll react
06-05-2018T03:26:02,unsteddyphoenix,...maybe
06-05-2018T03:26:11,Vatruvius,Unfortunately I have no info on it.
06-05-2018T03:26:48,Vatruvius,My anti-virus software has an extension on Chrome so it immediately blocked it and closed the site.
06-05-2018T03:28:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Kitten stuffing face
06-05-2018T03:29:30,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-katdryer:
06-05-2018T03:29:42,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs about 4 for Tom. May have gone to bed
06-05-2018T03:29:58,unsteddyphoenix,only?
06-05-2018T03:30:28,Vatruvius,Maybe thinking about it Kiwi.
06-05-2018T03:31:52,Bgrmystr2,"Even if you don't have any info, letting them know it's still there"
06-05-2018T03:31:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Thinking of making chicken n rice for breakfast
06-05-2018T03:31:56,Bgrmystr2,and still being a problem
06-05-2018T03:31:59,Bgrmystr2,is important
06-05-2018T03:32:26,Vatruvius,One sec.
06-05-2018T03:34:34,Vatruvius,"Like I said, I have no idea what it was. My anti-virus blocked whatever it was, gave the link address of the suspected phishing site and recommended me to close the page."
06-05-2018T03:34:47,SpazztasticKiwi,How does something so small eat so much
06-05-2018T03:35:17,Vatruvius,"Since it is smaller, it will actually need more energy to keep itself alive."
06-05-2018T03:35:17,Bgrmystr2,what you can do is get that link and email it to keenspot
06-05-2018T03:35:28,Vatruvius,Well i have it.
06-05-2018T03:35:52,Bgrmystr2,"email it to keenspot, tell them it's a phishing link, and that it was from one of their ads"
06-05-2018T03:36:18,Bgrmystr2,and that they prolly shouldn't click it :V
06-05-2018T03:36:32,Bgrmystr2,and nor should you for that matter lol
06-05-2018T03:36:34,Vatruvius,I do not know if it was from one of their ads. If it was it would have been on of those automatic ads that pop of a new window.
06-05-2018T03:36:45,Vatruvius,Or redirect your current window.
06-05-2018T03:36:47,Bgrmystr2,naw not always
06-05-2018T03:37:18,Vatruvius,Because I did not click any ads.
06-05-2018T03:37:23,Bgrmystr2,You don't have to
06-05-2018T03:37:39,Vatruvius,"Well, I can try I guess."
06-05-2018T03:37:40,Bgrmystr2,"the ad just has to be present on the page. When the page loads the ad, it loads the phishing link too"
06-05-2018T03:37:51,Bgrmystr2,and it activates just from that.
06-05-2018T03:38:14,Bgrmystr2,"hence why people are talking about adblock & ublock and such, as they prevent the ads from popping up in the first place"
06-05-2018T03:38:32,Bgrmystr2,which prevents the phishing link from being able to surface as well.
06-05-2018T03:38:38,Vatruvius,Or an extension like my security software adds.
06-05-2018T03:38:46,Bgrmystr2,"or that, yes"
06-05-2018T03:39:10,Bgrmystr2,"though most security software don't block ads, they just block attacks and stuff"
06-05-2018T03:39:21,Bgrmystr2,"same result, it protects you"
06-05-2018T03:39:33,Vatruvius,What was the email again? Is there a general way I should title the email and what I should write in the body?
06-05-2018T03:41:24,Bgrmystr2,yeah the email is just keenspot@keenspot.com
06-05-2018T03:41:30,Bgrmystr2,from the front page of their site
06-05-2018T03:44:21,Bgrmystr2,"Dunno what the subject should be, they'll prolly read it anyway, maybe just 'potential phishing link from ad' or somethin"
06-05-2018T03:44:37,Bgrmystr2,and just tell them about the link and what happened :u
06-05-2018T03:47:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm gonna try the sleep thing
06-05-2018T03:47:28,Bgrmystr2,Gnight then Kiwi
06-05-2018T03:47:29,SpazztasticKiwi,See y‚Äôall tomorrow
06-05-2018T03:52:29,Vatruvius,Good night Kiwi!
06-05-2018T03:52:44,Vatruvius,Email with part of the phishing site link has been set.
06-05-2018T03:52:56,Dadrobit,Night Kiwi
06-05-2018T03:53:21,Vatruvius,My anti-virus software does not allow it to be a clickable link so that is good. They just named the link.
06-05-2018T03:53:37,Vatruvius,sent*
06-05-2018T03:54:24,Bgrmystr2,Hope they can do somethin with it
06-05-2018T03:54:30,Bgrmystr2,"they might not, but"
06-05-2018T03:54:38,Bgrmystr2,"if they can, it was worth it"
06-05-2018T03:57:18,Vatruvius,"Yeah. Having ads like that just makes more people want to use ad blockers which means less revenue for keenspot which hosts these cool comics and I would not want them to go down though I dought they will go down. Maybe, but I think they are too popular?"
06-05-2018T03:57:20,Vatruvius,I do not know.
06-05-2018T04:00:40,Bgrmystr2,they likely won't go down due to the sheer number of people visiting
06-05-2018T04:01:54,Vatruvius,"Didn't think so, but less people getting phishing ads the better."
06-05-2018T04:05:40,Bgrmystr2,Agreed
06-05-2018T04:21:42,Dadrobit,:/ Crap. I'm in a hyperloop of YouTube videos on dirtbike restoration....

06-05-2018T14:18:55,SiliconCarbide,just went through the poll results from yesterdays stream
06-05-2018T14:19:26,SiliconCarbide,3 of the 4 winners were depictions of characters catching other characters doing something embarassing
06-05-2018T14:19:34,SiliconCarbide,feel like theres a pattern here
06-05-2018T14:20:55,MalinSharpPaw,is there such a thing as free art?

06-05-2018T15:17:35,Bgrmystr2,You'll see him eventually if you hang around long enough
06-05-2018T15:17:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Pops in at random
06-05-2018T15:17:50,SiliconCarbide,like some mystical unicorn?
06-05-2018T15:17:56,Bgrmystr2,yes.

06-05-2018T15:20:29,NickTheName,Ok I'll try it. Tom? what is 2-4 + 6?
06-05-2018T15:20:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"Speaking of mysterious, would you guys say a 3 bed/1 bath house is worth $60,000?"
06-05-2018T15:21:21,NickTheName,Where is it located?
06-05-2018T15:22:07,Bgrmystr2,"VERY depends, Kiwi. Cuz some of the 3 bed 2 bath houses here are 180k, while others are 220k"
06-05-2018T15:22:15,Bgrmystr2,and some others are like 130k
06-05-2018T15:22:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚ÄúMinutes from town‚Äù it says, kind of a secluded area"
06-05-2018T15:22:39,Bgrmystr2,"too many factors, the bed/bath is very littl"
06-05-2018T15:22:44,Bgrmystr2,little*
06-05-2018T15:23:10,SpazztasticKiwi,That was my issue: 1 bath for 3 bed?
06-05-2018T15:23:18,Bgrmystr2,"it happens, yeah"
06-05-2018T15:23:44,Bgrmystr2,"sometimes you get 1 bathroom for 3 bedroom, and it's only a couple that live there"
06-05-2018T15:23:56,Bgrmystr2,and they use the room for w/e
06-05-2018T15:24:08,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs definitely too much for just me and two cats and a frog
06-05-2018T15:24:59,NickTheName,I would not say that ... Frogs need a lot of space
06-05-2018T15:25:11,SpazztasticKiwi,But it‚Äôs interesting. Getting a bigger house might pay off if I end up having someone move in with me
06-05-2018T15:26:04,SiliconCarbide,"cant comment on the prices in the us, but 60k for a house in germany would be extremely cheap"
06-05-2018T15:26:07,NickTheName,another frog?
06-05-2018T15:26:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Like a friend or something
06-05-2018T15:26:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Or the magic occasion of me actually getting married
06-05-2018T15:27:20,SpazztasticKiwi,And if neither of those things happen: more room for my cats
06-05-2018T15:27:30,NickTheName,and frogs
06-05-2018T15:27:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Peeka is a Pac Man frog. She stays in her tank
06-05-2018T15:30:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Might get another snake too but that‚Äôs a little further away
06-05-2018T15:33:11,NickTheName,snakes are great!

06-05-2018T15:41:28,NickTheName,I don't see a problem
06-05-2018T15:41:53,Bgrmystr2,"as long as you don't have a big snake, it'll be fine."
06-05-2018T15:42:10,Bgrmystr2,Dangernoodle Von Noperope is a do not want.
06-05-2018T15:44:50,BadFoMo,Shake Lady? You mean a Naga?
06-05-2018T15:48:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve never had more than one snake at a time
06-05-2018T15:49:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"And the biggest was 6 feet, and I didn‚Äôt keep him for long - he was a nurse back to health situation"
06-05-2018T15:50:37,SpazztasticKiwi,My main goal is to get a snake trained to sit in my shirt
06-05-2018T15:51:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Watch people‚Äôs reactions when a snake pokes its head out. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a snake in my boob‚Äù
06-05-2018T15:53:00,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh: hahaha
06-05-2018T15:53:03,Bgrmystr2,god damn
06-05-2018T15:53:13,Bgrmystr2,"well played, you will take my +1 you deserve all of it."
06-05-2018T15:53:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Best way to make someone regret looking there
06-05-2018T15:54:28,Xexanoth,"just gives people an excuse to look there: ""just waiting for the snake to pop out"""
06-05-2018T15:54:49,SpazztasticKiwi,And snakes absorb body heat. Hot day - cool snake: win/win
06-05-2018T15:56:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom, how are you on snakes? Nope or don‚Äôt care"
06-05-2018T15:56:07,BadFoMo,(Snake pokes head out.) Snake: Ohi.
06-05-2018T15:56:42,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúYou lookin at my mom?‚Äù
06-05-2018T16:04:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera is begging for a bite of ice cream
06-05-2018T16:06:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I bought him some gravy cat treats and he wants ice cream for breakfast instead
06-05-2018T16:56:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"Did you guys know that in order to cook your rice, you must turn on the stove? Because it took me at least ten minutes to realize it wasn‚Äôt on"
06-05-2018T16:57:17,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-shock: Wait, you need to turn on a stove?"
06-05-2018T16:57:39,Bgrmystr2,oh no... and here I thought I could just cook the rice with the box...
06-05-2018T16:57:47,Bgrmystr2,everything I knew was wrong
06-05-2018T16:57:48,Mippy,You need a stove?
06-05-2018T16:57:51,Bgrmystr2,apparently
06-05-2018T16:58:00,Bgrmystr2,whatever that is.
06-05-2018T17:00:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôd get a rice cooker, but I don‚Äôt cook rice that much"
06-05-2018T17:03:05,Mippy,I'm on my second cooker in 5 years
06-05-2018T17:04:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Did you blow the first one up?
06-05-2018T17:04:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause I‚Äôve seen someone do something like that
06-05-2018T17:04:45,Mippy,Honestly...It just quit. It would not heat up.
06-05-2018T17:05:11,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI give up‚Äù
06-05-2018T17:06:18,Mippy,Pretty much
06-05-2018T17:07:01,SpazztasticKiwi,We had a pot burst into flames once
06-05-2018T17:07:54,Mippy,I melted a spatula
06-05-2018T17:08:34,SpazztasticKiwi,My sister was cooking and it just went whoosh üî•
06-05-2018T17:09:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Blew a hole in the bottom
06-05-2018T17:11:03,Mippy,Dang 0_o
06-05-2018T17:13:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I wish we had a Japanese place around here. We only have a Mexican restaurant in town
06-05-2018T17:14:14,Mippy,We have several Japanese places.
06-05-2018T17:14:39,Mippy,the closest wee have to authentic Mexican is Much Burrito
06-05-2018T17:14:50,Mippy,*Mucho
06-05-2018T17:14:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Very Spice
06-05-2018T17:15:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve had legit Japanese once
06-05-2018T17:15:57,SpazztasticKiwi,And that restaurant is the only legit Mexican I‚Äôve had
06-05-2018T17:17:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I even learned how to use chopsticks
06-05-2018T17:19:12,Mippy,...I leaned how to use chopstick from this one segment on Azumanga Dioh :ptv-uneasy:
06-05-2018T17:19:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"Not sure I‚Äôm good at it, but at least I know how to hold them"
06-05-2018T17:20:11,Mippy,I've gotten pretty decent over the years.
06-05-2018T17:22:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I prefer to use a fork ideally
06-05-2018T17:22:49,Xexanoth,"the only question is, why would you ever use chopstick instead of a fork?"
06-05-2018T17:23:11,Bgrmystr2,Because Japan
06-05-2018T17:23:51,SpazztasticKiwi,For a more immersive experience?
06-05-2018T17:24:24,SpazztasticKiwi,To just learn something new
06-05-2018T17:24:43,unsteddyphoenix,So asian people will respect the filthy foreigner in their restaurant.
06-05-2018T17:25:23,unsteddyphoenix,I will never ask for a fork again!
06-05-2018T17:25:41,Mippy,*watching stuff about Chris Chan for seome reason* Gotta have that spoon power
06-05-2018T17:25:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm definitely not using chopsticks in front of a native. ‚ÄúShow off American‚Äù ring bells?
06-05-2018T17:26:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Just because you can doesn‚Äôt mean you should
06-05-2018T17:27:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Or maybe I tip toe too much
06-05-2018T17:27:07,unsteddyphoenix,Thats...the only time i'd use chopsticks :thinking:
06-05-2018T17:27:50,unsteddyphoenix,"I dont think doing something they can all do is ""showing off"""
06-05-2018T17:28:01,TorqueEmUp,^
06-05-2018T17:28:10,unsteddyphoenix,Unless you mastered some sick chopstick tricks.
06-05-2018T17:29:01,Mippy,^ I'd like to see that
06-05-2018T17:30:36,TorqueEmUp,"Wherever in the world you go, you will find prejudice against people."
06-05-2018T17:31:02,SpazztasticKiwi,All the more reason to stay inside at home
06-05-2018T17:31:20,TorqueEmUp,"Like if you go to Japan, and go out to the country, people will outright refuse to provide you service, and kick you out of their stores."
06-05-2018T17:32:09,SpazztasticKiwi,No ‚Äúcustomer is always right‚Äù? I like it
06-05-2018T17:32:53,TorqueEmUp,"No they just have the same attitude Americans have, except if you don't speak Japanese get out of my store."
06-05-2018T17:34:09,TorqueEmUp,"Hell, even if you do speak good Japanese, but are clearly foreign they still tend to refuse service."
06-05-2018T17:34:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Sounds like some people I know and their ‚Äúspeak English‚Äù thing
06-05-2018T17:35:52,Mippy,I can honestly understand the fustration with serving someone who dose not speak your language. Or soeone who can and just refuses too.
06-05-2018T17:36:44,TorqueEmUp,"Honestly in a store, how much communication do you really need as long as everything is properly marked and priced?"
06-05-2018T17:37:08,TorqueEmUp,"Now a resteraunt, that'd make more sense if you refuse service."
06-05-2018T17:37:22,Mippy,I work in a resturant mate
06-05-2018T17:37:56,TorqueEmUp,I am not saying all resteraunts
06-05-2018T17:37:59,SpazztasticKiwi,You have to appreciate those who try though
06-05-2018T17:38:46,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, even in the cities in Japan, Ramen stands and such will refuse you service."
06-05-2018T17:38:56,Mippy,Never said you did Torque
06-05-2018T17:38:59,TorqueEmUp,Unless you speak Japanese
06-05-2018T17:39:46,SpazztasticKiwi,We‚Äôve had a German lady come in looking for some meats cut using the metric system. Took a bit to figure out what exactly she needed
06-05-2018T17:39:53,TorqueEmUp,"I now I am harping on Japan a lot, but it happens pretty much everywhere."
06-05-2018T17:40:29,Mippy,^ Yup...that's life
06-05-2018T17:40:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Hear about the restaurant getting sued for discriminating against an African American group?
06-05-2018T17:41:41,Mippy,Nope. I don't really pay attention to the news. Too depressing
06-05-2018T17:41:58,unsteddyphoenix,wasnt that starbucks
06-05-2018T17:42:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"They were told it was ‚Äúpolicy‚Äù for ‚Äúnew patrons‚Äù to prepay for meals, but they were the only ones that experienced that ‚Äúpolicy‚Äù"
06-05-2018T17:43:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"They got $10,000 or so in damages"
06-05-2018T17:46:10,Twokinds,That's pretty bad.
06-05-2018T17:48:03,unsteddyphoenix,Happy ending though!
06-05-2018T17:51:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I figured they deserved more damages for something so stupid
06-05-2018T17:52:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Because they look different you make up a policy to prevent them from doing behavior you assume of them?
06-05-2018T17:52:21,Bgrmystr2,"What the fuck kinda food establishment demands you ""prepay""?"
06-05-2018T17:52:41,TorqueEmUp,Fast food?
06-05-2018T17:52:44,Bgrmystr2,"You go in, order food, and pay for it."
06-05-2018T17:52:51,TorqueEmUp,which is pretty much what starbucks is tbh.
06-05-2018T17:53:05,Bgrmystr2,yeah but you don't like.. have to call like.. make an order before going in and getting the thing.
06-05-2018T17:53:07,SpazztasticKiwi,It was some sit in restaurant that claimed they got a lot of done and dashers so those who weren‚Äôt regulars had to prepay
06-05-2018T17:53:12,unsteddyphoenix,More than 10k? Thats a lot of money to me...
06-05-2018T17:53:16,Bgrmystr2,"also no, it's not something required, Torque"
06-05-2018T17:53:16,SpazztasticKiwi,*dine
06-05-2018T17:53:35,Bgrmystr2,cuz you can just walk into Starbucks and buy something at the counter
06-05-2018T17:53:44,Bgrmystr2,cuzthey're no different than any other storefront
06-05-2018T17:53:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve never been to Starbucks
06-05-2018T17:53:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Too expensive
06-05-2018T17:53:58,SpazztasticKiwi,And sugary
06-05-2018T17:54:18,Bgrmystr2,"they don't function any different, they're just posh for the sake of it."
06-05-2018T17:54:38,Bgrmystr2,"they aren't special, Kiwi"
06-05-2018T17:54:40,Bgrmystr2,don't worry
06-05-2018T17:54:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Fancy for the sake of being fancy
06-05-2018T17:54:42,Bgrmystr2,yes
06-05-2018T17:54:58,Bgrmystr2,what they sell isn't even all that good imo
06-05-2018T17:55:05,Bgrmystr2,I've tasted way better
06-05-2018T17:55:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Not my kind of venue. I‚Äôll drink regular coffee. Better for you anyway
06-05-2018T17:55:48,Mippy,Starbucks is not a place for the tea drinker
06-05-2018T17:56:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll drink coffee plain but I like creamer more than sugar
06-05-2018T17:56:38,SpazztasticKiwi,And I‚Äôll drink green tea strong and straight from the pot
06-05-2018T17:57:16,Mippy,stron tea is best tea

06-05-2018T17:59:48,TorqueEmUp,Black tea and water for me.
06-05-2018T18:00:10,TorqueEmUp,"basically all I drink, with the very rare sugary drink of some sort."
06-05-2018T18:01:21,TorqueEmUp,"Also I like how I am STILL a basic member, even though I haven't paid Picarto in months for it. lol"

06-05-2018T18:11:21,SpazztasticKiwi,It didn‚Äôt burn. Just took longer to cook
06-05-2018T18:11:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm debating watching Freddy vs Jason again

06-05-2018T18:44:01,Xexanoth,"eh, i think most horror movies just aren't very interesting"
06-05-2018T18:44:03,Bgrmystr2,"Dunno Kiwi, I just don't handle that kinda stuff well"

06-05-2018T23:45:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"And if Eric starts going after taken women, I‚Äôll never like him again"
06-05-2018T23:45:21,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs teasing and then there‚Äôs no no
06-05-2018T23:45:45,Ordithus,Mike's Harem ending: he gets all the single ladies.  And Evals.
06-05-2018T23:46:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Mike‚Äôs so precious I just wanna pinch his little cheeks
06-05-2018T23:46:36,unsteddyphoenix,Poor poor Mike...
06-05-2018T23:46:44,Ordithus,"He'll beat you up, Kiwi."
06-05-2018T23:46:45,BadFoMo,What if Eric accadentaly goes after a woman he didn't know was taken?
06-05-2018T23:46:49,SpazztasticKiwi,He strikes me as jumpy. Someone who‚Äôd come across a pretty girl and panic
06-05-2018T23:47:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Not knowing and pursuing is different than knowing and pursuing
06-05-2018T23:47:53,unsteddyphoenix,I dont think Mike could win a fight against a wet paper bag
06-05-2018T23:48:20,Ordithus,Evals is a wet paper bag.
06-05-2018T23:48:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"Once he finds out, leave the situation"
06-05-2018T23:49:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"I knew a guy that was flirty and nice. Older by a few years, but he seemed pretty cool"
06-05-2018T23:49:15,unsteddyphoenix,thats true
06-05-2018T23:49:41,Mippy,I don't know anyone....
06-05-2018T23:49:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"Found out he was married, and he says ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not divorced, just separated‚Äù"
06-05-2018T23:49:58,Mippy,I'M SO ALONE!
06-05-2018T23:50:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Not single? Don‚Äôt talk to me
06-05-2018T23:50:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Not in a relationship way anyway
06-05-2018T23:50:22,Ordithus,"Yeah, that be a no no."
06-05-2018T23:50:30,unsteddyphoenix,"we're on a break!"""
06-05-2018T23:50:47,Ordithus,"What am I, the intermission?!"
06-05-2018T23:51:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I was apparently the side quest or something
06-05-2018T23:51:20,unsteddyphoenix,side-something
06-05-2018T23:52:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"Almost 7 years older, too. Older can be better but jeez. Not if you‚Äôre technically spoken for"
06-05-2018T23:52:14,Mippy,I have no experiance in these type of matters *goes back to fantasy land*
06-05-2018T23:53:20,SpazztasticKiwi,But back on the characters
06-05-2018T23:53:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel Eric‚Äôs kinda having a mid life crisis of some sort
06-05-2018T23:54:20,unsteddyphoenix,Isnt he like...20
06-05-2018T23:54:26,Ordithus,Ish
06-05-2018T23:54:36,Mippy,at like 21?
06-05-2018T23:54:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Early mid life crisis
06-05-2018T23:54:51,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe it's a millenial mid-life crises
06-05-2018T23:54:53,Ordithus,"Oh, so the books do downplay Maren and Trace's relationship.  Not explicitly gf/bf unlike the web version."
06-05-2018T23:54:54,unsteddyphoenix,I heard theyre unique
06-05-2018T23:55:04,unsteddyphoenix,Oh really?
06-05-2018T23:55:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Mid life crises usually happen about 30s so I‚Äôve heard. Eric‚Äôs getting it out of the way
06-05-2018T23:56:29,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI need to feel young again!‚Äù ‚ÄúYoung like what - high school?‚Äù
06-05-2018T23:56:32,unsteddyphoenix,How clever
06-05-2018T23:56:50,unsteddyphoenix,If only he'd thought to gain a conscience early
06-05-2018T23:56:54,Ordithus,30s?!  :ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:
06-05-2018T23:57:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"Eric, there‚Äôs more to life than girls. Promise"
06-05-2018T23:57:26,Mippy,who's in their 30's'?
06-05-2018T23:57:44,PhilTheIdle,"Gotta go to school now, bye."
06-05-2018T23:58:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Well Tom but I‚Äôm 90% sure he‚Äôs an exception
06-05-2018T23:59:00,unsteddyphoenix,I dont think anyone?
06-05-2018T23:59:03,unsteddyphoenix,Trace is 25...
06-05-2018T23:59:27,Ordithus,I suppose some of the Keidran kinda are?
06-05-2018T23:59:36,Mippy,.... Aster Alabaster? Possibly?
06-05-2018T23:59:57,unsteddyphoenix,"True, possibly him."
