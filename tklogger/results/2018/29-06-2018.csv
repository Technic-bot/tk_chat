29-06-2018T00:27:49,FenceEqualizer,So is the wolf suppose to be fenrir?
29-06-2018T00:27:55,ZRO4825,Yup :)
29-06-2018T00:27:56,TheFDdriver,i like the FD because of the body
29-06-2018T00:28:33,FenceEqualizer,Being hit right in the nostalgia
29-06-2018T00:28:39,Bgrmystr2,tuned in at the perfect moment for Sage's music
29-06-2018T00:28:39,TheFDdriver,good
29-06-2018T00:29:14,FenceEqualizer,The game was super fun.
29-06-2018T00:29:42,TheFDdriver,well guys im going to switch phones brb
29-06-2018T03:49:27,Bgrmystr2,so I'll take what little win I can.
29-06-2018T03:57:04,FenceEqualizer,Welp going to watch more Tanya the evil before bed. You guys have a good night and see you on Sunday!
29-06-2018T03:58:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Fence
29-06-2018T04:01:31,Dadrobit,Awwww yeeeeea. Found my old music folder.
29-06-2018T04:01:55,Dadrobit,"More weeb music than I remember, but was a good time."
29-06-2018T04:03:15,Dadrobit,Just need to throw down a couple grand on a euphonium and I'm set :D
29-06-2018T04:21:34,unsteddyphoenix,those are a couple grand???
29-06-2018T04:23:07,Bgrmystr2,most instruments at a decent quality are a pretty penny yeah
29-06-2018T04:23:25,Bgrmystr2,saxophones tend to be around 1-2grand for beginner student horns
29-06-2018T04:23:37,Bgrmystr2,mine was $1.5k
29-06-2018T04:23:53,Bgrmystr2,is probably worth about $6k now
29-06-2018T04:26:48,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I mean just the materials alone are costly. That thing's like 17-18 feet of brass to shape."
29-06-2018T04:27:00,unsteddyphoenix,god damn
29-06-2018T04:27:14,unsteddyphoenix,you could buy so many recorders with that
29-06-2018T04:27:21,unsteddyphoenix,the superior instrument
29-06-2018T04:28:00,Dadrobit,"On the cheap end, they're $400-$500. But at that point they're made out of plastic or steel."
29-06-2018T04:28:19,Dadrobit,But entry level for quality is about $2k.
29-06-2018T04:29:42,Dadrobit,Not kidding btw https://i.imgur.com/dfQ2TnB.jpg
29-06-2018T04:30:30,Dadrobit,$660 for that one.
29-06-2018T04:31:31,unsteddyphoenix,jesus
29-06-2018T04:35:37,Bgrmystr2,yeah the fact that it's still several hundred dollars
29-06-2018T04:35:42,Bgrmystr2,for something that's plastic..
29-06-2018T04:36:06,Bgrmystr2,that's somethin else
29-06-2018T04:54:13,Zdziwionykot,oh no i miss the stream
29-06-2018T04:57:22,Bgrmystr2,"wayyy missed, dude"
29-06-2018T04:57:32,Bgrmystr2,it's like 6am eastern
29-06-2018T04:57:45,Bgrmystr2,it started at 9pm eastern yesterday
29-06-2018T04:58:08,Bgrmystr2,and ended about 3-4 hours ago
29-06-2018T04:58:24,Bgrmystr2,"well, sage ended an hour ago, but he was done for a while"
29-06-2018T05:08:42,Zdziwionykot,oh ok..
29-06-2018T11:39:52,SiliconCarbide,"kind of a rnd question, but how do you tip in the us? like in diners, do you give the tip seperately, in cash?"
29-06-2018T11:57:08,Twokinds,"Yeah, or on the bill itself."
29-06-2018T11:57:35,Twokinds,There's a line on the bill where you can write the tip. Or you can just leave it on the table.
29-06-2018T14:04:38,sunblaze,hiya
29-06-2018T14:05:33,SageSaga,yo!
29-06-2018T14:06:02,FoxxTrotter,:0)
29-06-2018T14:19:11,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-sleepy: mornin
29-06-2018T14:19:16,Bgrmystr2,clearly I didn't miss much
29-06-2018T14:19:37,SageSaga,yeah
29-06-2018T14:20:57,SageSaga,only been streaming for 20 minutes now
29-06-2018T14:21:45,FoxxTrotter,"Hey, Bgr."
29-06-2018T14:22:30,Bgrmystr2,woke up to my computer being off
29-06-2018T14:22:36,Bgrmystr2,so that was a strange experience
29-06-2018T14:22:41,Tharkis,:ctharkis-earwiggle:
29-06-2018T14:22:48,Bgrmystr2,hey tharkis
29-06-2018T14:23:49,SageSaga,apparently i drank all my water without realizing it- brb
29-06-2018T14:26:06,Tharkis,i did that so often that i bought a 2.5 gallon water jug with spigot that i can keep by my desk to re-fill
29-06-2018T14:26:50,SageSaga,the fridge isnt very far from my room so its not a big deal and even helpful- gets me out of my seat for a bit XD
29-06-2018T14:27:23,Bgrmystr2,I have a fridge in my room so I don't need to really go very far for it
29-06-2018T14:27:27,Bgrmystr2,super useful
29-06-2018T14:27:31,SageSaga,"""Ive been sitting here drawing for 9 hours straight, have i eaten today?"" . . . ""Ouch- nope"""
29-06-2018T14:28:59,Tharkis,the 'forget to eat' diet is fairly effective though =)
29-06-2018T14:29:25,ZRO4825,Not as much as one would think at times. 😂
29-06-2018T14:29:26,SageSaga,no it isnt- it causes your body to think its starving and so it conserves more fat
29-06-2018T14:30:09,SageSaga,"combined with the ""Sitting for 9 hours straight"" part- its how you turn into one of the Hutts"
29-06-2018T14:31:59,ZRO4825,Do I get a slave girl in a metal bikini out of the deal?
29-06-2018T14:32:21,sunblaze,oh cool do you ge a snaeky bitichy alien at the tip of your tail as well?
29-06-2018T14:32:22,sunblaze,:P
29-06-2018T14:32:30,SageSaga,yes but she kills you before you do anything pervy
29-06-2018T14:32:55,SageSaga,and no you dont get Crum
29-06-2018T14:33:12,ZRO4825,"Pros and cons to everything I guess, lol"
29-06-2018T14:48:45,ZRO4825,Page is lookin good from what I
29-06-2018T14:49:14,ZRO4825,Can see when I get a chance to look in
29-06-2018T14:50:13,Bgrmystr2,Looked like you said when you get a dance
29-06-2018T14:50:41,Bgrmystr2,Zro needs dancing :v
29-06-2018T14:51:09,ZRO4825,Belly dancing Toyoko?
29-06-2018T14:51:20,Bgrmystr2,I was thinking of you dancing but
29-06-2018T14:51:22,Bgrmystr2,ehh
29-06-2018T14:51:45,Bgrmystr2,"well crap, my nvidia control panel won't boot."
29-06-2018T14:51:50,Bgrmystr2,typical
29-06-2018T14:51:56,ZRO4825,That wouldn't be pretty at all :x
29-06-2018T14:52:27,Bgrmystr2,s'okay just dance like murray off Hotel Transylvania
29-06-2018T14:52:34,Bgrmystr2,you're good
29-06-2018T14:52:37,ZRO4825,Haven't seen
29-06-2018T14:52:43,Bgrmystr2,then go see it
29-06-2018T14:53:23,ZRO4825,Would rather play games. :V
29-06-2018T14:53:31,Bgrmystr2,do btoh
29-06-2018T14:53:42,Bgrmystr2,both* jaksvbfas Dx
29-06-2018T15:11:14,SageSaga,so quiet today
29-06-2018T15:11:28,FoxxTrotter,Mmm-hmm.
29-06-2018T15:19:54,ZRO4825,makes loud noises.
29-06-2018T15:22:12,Bgrmystr2,quiet up front! Some of us are trying to watch in peace. :ptv-unimpressed:
29-06-2018T15:22:29,Xexanoth,blasts air horn
29-06-2018T15:36:07,ZRO4825,:P
29-06-2018T15:51:21,SageSaga,woke up a bit early today- my AC started beeping like crazy and shut off
29-06-2018T16:07:32,Xexanoth,that doesn't sound good
29-06-2018T16:08:19,SageSaga,the humidity has been crazy high lately and the AC unit keeps filling it's tank with the water it's removing from the air
29-06-2018T16:09:29,Bgrmystr2,"hm, does it empty automatically?"
29-06-2018T16:10:33,SageSaga,if it did it would be all over my wooden floors!
29-06-2018T16:11:03,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: So you have to empty it manually?
29-06-2018T16:11:21,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, I don't think our AC does that"
29-06-2018T16:11:25,SageSaga,its a standing unit with a hose to the outside for air- but not to expel the water- so i roll it into my shower and drain it XD
29-06-2018T16:12:15,JamesBSquirrel3,Wow! Sage done very well. Hi guys!:ptv-excited::ptv-greetings:
29-06-2018T16:12:45,Bgrmystr2,having to drain water from an AC unit seems super strange to me
29-06-2018T16:12:49,Bgrmystr2,why does it collect water?
29-06-2018T16:12:57,sunblaze,ah just had to reread AI so funny :D
29-06-2018T16:13:01,sunblaze,poor rem :D
29-06-2018T16:13:27,SageSaga,uhh- it's an air CONDITIONER
29-06-2018T16:13:39,SageSaga,what about Rem?
29-06-2018T16:14:04,Bgrmystr2,"ours doesn't collect water. :thinking: At least, if it does, we don't need to touch it."
29-06-2018T16:14:13,Bgrmystr2,and I've never heard of any AC that you need to empty
29-06-2018T16:14:14,sunblaze,her aqwardess is so damn funny
29-06-2018T16:14:23,SageSaga,you mean Relm?
29-06-2018T16:14:33,sunblaze,yeah
29-06-2018T16:14:35,sunblaze,kaylin is to bold for her own good
29-06-2018T16:14:37,Bgrmystr2,"lots of houses here have window units, but once you install it, you're done lol"
29-06-2018T16:14:46,FoxxTrotter,"Some portable ones you do have to empty, Bgr. Primarily, ones that don't have a vent."
29-06-2018T16:15:19,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering: das weird
29-06-2018T16:15:41,SageSaga,Bgr - air conditioners control the humidity by drawing it in and condensing it and collecting it as water- depending on the type it expels it outside (Window unit) or into your water drain like in a home unit
29-06-2018T16:17:09,SageSaga,i think some also use the water as part of the cooling because running air over water removes the heat from the air
29-06-2018T16:17:22,Bgrmystr2,hm. Hadn't ever heard of one like yours before lol
29-06-2018T16:18:41,SageSaga,https://i1.wp.com/reviewsmimi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Best-Portable-Air-Conditioner.jpg?resize=1024%2C582&ssl=1
29-06-2018T16:19:03,SageSaga,like that
29-06-2018T16:19:22,Bgrmystr2,wow.. that looks.. terrible. How effective are they?
29-06-2018T16:19:58,SageSaga,as good if not better than a Window unit
29-06-2018T16:20:07,Bgrmystr2,really? Huh
29-06-2018T16:20:15,SageSaga,also they often have rollers so you can move em around easily
29-06-2018T16:20:33,Bgrmystr2,"cuz every window unit around here sucks. they work, but they suck"
29-06-2018T16:20:50,Bgrmystr2,and can't properly cool a room bigger than 10x10
29-06-2018T16:21:07,SageSaga,all AC units suck they have to intake air from somewhere
29-06-2018T16:21:18,Bgrmystr2,boo
29-06-2018T16:21:21,sunblaze,^......
29-06-2018T16:21:33,Bgrmystr2,that wasn't even a good one
29-06-2018T16:21:37,sunblaze,where are you Bg? sounds wierd
29-06-2018T16:21:48,Bgrmystr2,Louisiana
29-06-2018T16:21:59,Bgrmystr2,s'always hot and wet here
29-06-2018T16:22:05,Bgrmystr2,for the most part
29-06-2018T16:22:36,sunblaze,hmm I have seen window-uints in central inda with 42C during the hottest time of the air. those worked
29-06-2018T16:22:45,sunblaze,guess the humid air of lousiana is the problem :(
29-06-2018T16:22:52,Bgrmystr2,proably
29-06-2018T16:23:01,Bgrmystr2,our humidity reaches up to 100% during summer
29-06-2018T16:23:08,sunblaze,urghhh
29-06-2018T16:23:14,Bgrmystr2,when it's also like over 90 to 100 degrees
29-06-2018T16:23:21,Bgrmystr2,:D
29-06-2018T16:23:37,Bgrmystr2,and then the hurricanes come in and send it everywhereee
29-06-2018T16:23:39,Bgrmystr2,it's great
29-06-2018T16:23:49,sunblaze,fun for the whole family?
29-06-2018T16:23:55,Bgrmystr2,you betcha
29-06-2018T16:24:07,FoxxTrotter,It's actually been a quite June in the Atlantic tropics for once.
29-06-2018T16:24:22,Bgrmystr2,"if you order now, we'll bundle your hurricane with a nest of tornados absolutely free!"
29-06-2018T16:24:45,Bgrmystr2,yeah it's been quiet* this year
29-06-2018T16:24:48,sunblaze,mid-west has more tornados
29-06-2018T16:24:48,Bgrmystr2,I'm really thankful
29-06-2018T16:25:16,sunblaze,but I am as stupid this year as well
29-06-2018T16:25:35,sunblaze,going to THE country for earthquakes 24/7 this year :P
29-06-2018T16:25:55,sunblaze,but I have to be in japan at least once in life
29-06-2018T16:26:02,Bgrmystr2,uh.. japan? :O
29-06-2018T16:26:15,Bgrmystr2,chili?
29-06-2018T16:26:27,Bgrmystr2,or anything on the west coast of the americas really
29-06-2018T16:26:52,sunblaze,nah I have been 2 weeks in california in 2013 and not even one small quake
29-06-2018T16:26:59,sunblaze,was quite sad :(
29-06-2018T16:27:22,Bgrmystr2,well yeah earthquakes are like that all the time everywhere
29-06-2018T16:27:28,Bgrmystr2,they're don't happen all the tim
29-06-2018T16:27:29,Bgrmystr2,time*
29-06-2018T16:27:37,Bgrmystr2,they're just.. random
29-06-2018T16:28:05,Bgrmystr2,that was worded poorly :thinking:
29-06-2018T16:28:21,sunblaze,I realize that but that makes it not less boring
29-06-2018T16:28:45,sunblaze,it was understandable so thats fine
29-06-2018T16:29:15,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, sage is that some kind of platform in the first panel?"
29-06-2018T16:29:16,sunblaze,all we have here is flood in southern germany and a draught in mid and north-germany
29-06-2018T16:29:20,sunblaze,way to dry
29-06-2018T16:29:59,Bgrmystr2,it looks like some kind of structure lol
29-06-2018T16:30:00,superwolfart,looking great
29-06-2018T16:30:25,Bgrmystr2,yeh page is nice so far
29-06-2018T16:30:29,sunblaze,"could be some kind of satelite from the time ""back then"""
29-06-2018T16:31:06,sunblaze,I mean the connection has to be handled sometime there as well why not sattelites?
29-06-2018T16:32:01,Xexanoth,@Sunblaze to be fair sometimes we also get storms that knock a handful of trees over :D
29-06-2018T16:33:39,sunblaze,true but we are not famours for them
29-06-2018T16:37:14,SageSaga,we are famous for Peanuts and Haaaaam
29-06-2018T16:37:36,sunblaze,ham is great yeah
29-06-2018T16:38:34,SageSaga,oh and for our states tourism motto not fitting it's response to the LGBTQ community a few years ago
29-06-2018T16:39:11,sunblaze,why? only he/she avaible?

29-06-2018T16:59:40,Bgrmystr2,guessing you off to D&D soon?
29-06-2018T16:59:45,SageSaga,the reason for him being obscured is well - 2 reason - one - Kaylin and Nyna havent actually been able to see him yet-
29-06-2018T17:00:26,SageSaga,and 2- if people saw him without anything to explain him well- let's just say it might pull people out of the comic a bit
29-06-2018T17:00:51,BadFoMo,How so?
29-06-2018T17:00:54,sunblaze,its probably a ray of freezing death. good thing kaylin has that cold resistance ring

29-06-2018T17:39:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, it’s good to see Rose got a good laugh"

29-06-2018T19:57:06,CrRAR,"Oh and unsteddy I thought more about your ""Sythe trying to escape"" comment..."
29-06-2018T19:57:14,CrRAR,and it's more hilarious the more I thought about it.
29-06-2018T19:58:15,CrRAR,"""The window... why you so far awayyy~"""
29-06-2018T19:58:18,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-LauraCry:
29-06-2018T20:03:12,SpazztasticKiwi,What comment on Sythe
29-06-2018T20:08:28,CrRAR,*rustling noises*
29-06-2018T20:10:51,CrRAR,When he saw lil plush sythe he remarked that he looked terrified and wanted to escape from Kat.
29-06-2018T20:11:13,CrRAR,Which makes total sense when I thought about it later.
29-06-2018T20:12:29,CrRAR,I forget that didn't happen in chat last night... it was when I showed him the crop. So no screenshot sadly XD
29-06-2018T20:14:06,CrRAR,*forgot

29-06-2018T21:11:17,CrRAR,"haha, gotta be PATRIOTIC"
29-06-2018T21:11:46,CrRAR,I've already heard a few sporadic *pops* around here over the past week or so.

29-06-2018T23:06:27,TheGamePlayer,:ptv-angry: just found out most of my games have suffered from disk rot... And Microsoft won't help me get digital copys...
29-06-2018T23:07:04,TheGamePlayer,So I have to buy back $1000 worth of games...
29-06-2018T23:10:24,TheGamePlayer,I over exaggerated but still it's a lot of games and a lot of $$$
29-06-2018T23:18:30,TheGamePlayer,"Well I'm done venting for tonight, good night!!!:ptv-greetings:"
29-06-2018T23:23:08,CrRAR,G'night!
29-06-2018T23:25:21,CrRAR,It's funny how media is promised as a vessel for archival so early in its life and then when it becomes an issue it's all just *crickets*.
