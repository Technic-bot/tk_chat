07-06-2018T21:56:32,Vatruvius,Is it possible for a guy to be on a fangirl level of fan and still be called a guy?

07-06-2018T23:23:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"It is not Dad, just checked"
07-06-2018T23:23:20,Dadrobit,There's at least a visual novel game for it.
07-06-2018T23:23:22,SageSaga,the first episode is weird because theres a crazy Time travel effect that occurs before you really know it was a time travel thing
07-06-2018T23:23:25,Bgrmystr2,"Hina, you're not Yama, silly. She's actually scary. :P"
07-06-2018T23:23:35,Zakuru,eehh...

07-06-2018T23:24:25,SageSaga,Erased was great but it had some issues- it's strength was its visuals music and design which made the story issues easy to ignore
07-06-2018T23:24:32,Zakuru,the ending sucked
07-06-2018T23:24:32,unsteddyphoenix,Is it bad that the cop is my favourite character nero

07-06-2018T23:48:16,unsteddyphoenix,Well this backfired then
07-06-2018T23:48:26,SageSaga,there's a large group of Twokinds fans that hate me
07-06-2018T23:48:50,ZRO4825,Pretty sure there's a large group of those fans that hate themselves and everything else by extension. :thinking:
07-06-2018T23:48:59,CrRAR,^
07-06-2018T23:49:05,unsteddyphoenix,I know like...one. Maybe.
07-06-2018T23:49:08,ItsActuallyKopyKat,why would they hate you sage?
07-06-2018T23:49:18,Zakuru,i dont hate anyone
07-06-2018T23:49:53,RimaDraws,me either can't do so
07-06-2018T23:50:10,SageSaga,jealous maybe? I probably banned them for being rude and they decided to start making voodoo dolls of me and when that didnt work they made a chat group to channel their hate
07-06-2018T23:50:10,unsteddyphoenix,I...dont hate Sage~
07-06-2018T23:50:19,Ordithus,wat
07-06-2018T23:50:22,Lucarionation,I wonder if anyone in the Twokinds Discord fan server hates Sage. &gt;.&lt;
07-06-2018T23:50:32,SpazztasticKiwi,let them scream to the void
07-06-2018T23:50:38,SageSaga,definitely Luca
07-06-2018T23:50:42,Ordithus,Haters gonna hate
07-06-2018T23:50:44,Combak,... I'm pretty sure saying stuff like that would be why people don't like you sage.
07-06-2018T23:50:51,unsteddyphoenix,literal voodoo dolls?
07-06-2018T23:50:52,ZRO4825,There are people who do. I know of some. I still haven't gotten straight answers out of any of them as to /why/.
