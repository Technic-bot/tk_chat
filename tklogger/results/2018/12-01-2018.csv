12-01-2018T00:00:00,TheBeckoner,Liquids arent wet - they wet things
12-01-2018T00:00:02,Dragen,Looks fine to me.
12-01-2018T00:00:06,Ordithus,Though I do love the color of CBlue
12-01-2018T00:00:07,CanisRufusUK,now if anyone ever used 8inch floppies I'll be impressed :3
12-01-2018T00:00:08,ZRO4825,"Depends on your point, Ron. To me I just love color in general, so I dislike black'n'white to begin with. But it doesn't like, do anything horrible to the comic imo."
12-01-2018T00:00:10,Mihari,"I think you should have just done B&W, not screentones."
12-01-2018T00:00:13,Nekonny,dont strarttt
12-01-2018T00:00:16,TheBeckoner,lol
12-01-2018T00:00:24,DJSylveon,Oh hey its midnight
12-01-2018T00:00:25,ZizzoGaming,What?
12-01-2018T00:00:34,Nekonny,I thin k I agree with mihari on that one
12-01-2018T00:00:36,ZizzoGaming,Did I miss something
12-01-2018T00:00:39,Dragen,"Simple black&white might be better though, as Mihari mentioned."
12-01-2018T00:00:47,Serpentfrog,"I've had 8 in floppies, but I'm not sure we mean the same thing, Canis."
12-01-2018T00:00:52,Ordithus,"Grayscale, technically"
12-01-2018T00:01:05,Ordithus,Pure B&W would be interesting
12-01-2018T00:01:07,Bgrmystr2,:( I am sad now. Can't find the stack of floppies I had
12-01-2018T00:01:08,ZRO4825,"I mean, maybe I'm weird, but I'd rather see something flat colored than just monochrome. :x"
12-01-2018T00:01:10,Mihari,"But of course as I said when it was in concept, I would have liked colour, but who wouldn't?"
12-01-2018T00:01:31,Tharkis,"i like it as it is, i'd like it if it was color, i like it because of the story"
12-01-2018T00:01:31,MrAMP,Heyo folks!
12-01-2018T00:01:35,Serpentfrog,Hi.
12-01-2018T00:01:35,MrAMP,How goes it all you fine folks.
12-01-2018T00:01:36,MetalAppleSauce,Hello AMP
12-01-2018T00:01:38,ZRO4825,Heyyo AMP
12-01-2018T00:01:38,CrRAR,hryo!
12-01-2018T00:01:39,Tharkis,people read webcomics more for the story than the specific art
12-01-2018T00:01:45,Nekonny,The idea was to make it fast
12-01-2018T00:01:47,Bgrmystr2,heya AMP
12-01-2018T00:01:48,TheBeckoner,Hello AMP
12-01-2018T00:01:54,unsteddyphoenix,People read webcomics for a lot of reasons
12-01-2018T00:01:58,Nekonny,but... it's not as fast as I would have liked
12-01-2018T00:02:00,ZRO4825,Is it actually much faster this way?
12-01-2018T00:02:06,ZRO4825,"Damnit, you answered while I was typing :joy:"
12-01-2018T00:02:08,DJSylveon,Thats what they say about my little pony
12-01-2018T00:02:09,Twokinds,Could get someone else to do color for you ^^
12-01-2018T00:02:18,aeoronwah,"Holy heck, that's super cute Ron :O"
12-01-2018T00:02:42,Nekonny,Perhaps
12-01-2018T00:02:42,Ordithus,"But then he'd have to pay them, like money, or something."
12-01-2018T00:02:44,Dragen,B&W works for us.
12-01-2018T00:02:47,Nekonny,but I can't afford that
12-01-2018T00:02:58,MrAMP,Flats or shades my good man?
12-01-2018T00:03:26,Nekonny,it's also a matter of quality control and consistency
12-01-2018T00:03:30,Ordithus,"Unless Ron and Tom do an exchange!  Tom colors in the lines like a good boy, and Ron can story board."
12-01-2018T00:03:35,Nekonny,you have enough on your plate amp :P
12-01-2018T00:03:45,Tegani,"Canis, I never owned a machine with 8-inch floppies, but a computer lab I used in college had them still."
12-01-2018T00:03:53,DJSylveon,Bed calling...eyes closing...mouth yawning...
12-01-2018T00:03:54,Nekonny,That is not the whey
12-01-2018T00:04:11,aeoronwah,"Oh god, why"

12-01-2018T00:45:33,TheBeckoner,Or if you don't like stealing you can make your own of whatever it is.

12-01-2018T01:13:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,A trap
12-01-2018T01:13:43,ZRO4825,"I alt-tab back over, screen full of Kaylin cleavage. I am not disappointed in this timing at all."
12-01-2018T01:22:45,RyanReaper,What’d I miss?
12-01-2018T01:22:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,everything
12-01-2018T01:23:01,RyanReaper,That Seems like a lot.
12-01-2018T01:23:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,could be more
12-01-2018T01:23:27,RyanReaper,More then I already missed?
12-01-2018T01:24:24,SageSaga,Depends on who you are here for-
12-01-2018T01:29:09,ZRO4825,"I'm here for Reiko, obviously. And today, we were all out of Reiko."
12-01-2018T01:29:45,SageSaga,you mean Rieko?
12-01-2018T01:29:55,ZRO4825,"Yup, that one."
12-01-2018T01:30:03,ZRO4825,damned lack of using her name for months.
12-01-2018T01:30:19,SageSaga,this month i thought you were all about Toyoko
12-01-2018T01:30:23,ZRO4825,I am.

12-01-2018T01:33:29,MatyMaty,oh no
12-01-2018T01:33:34,MatyMaty,I was just bluffing XD
12-01-2018T01:33:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Toyoko is best
12-01-2018T01:35:30,Gelter,"So what I'm wondering about this comic is: is the dude playing Kaylin still attached to the game, but has lost his memories, and if so, shouldn't he have starved to death by now; or is he not connected and Kaylin is acting ""on her own""? or to be revealed"
12-01-2018T01:35:47,SageSaga,all answered eventually
12-01-2018T01:35:55,MatyMaty,I imagine
12-01-2018T01:36:14,MatyMaty,he is at a hospital or something
12-01-2018T01:36:23,MatyMaty,that would be the most logical thing
12-01-2018T01:36:35,Gelter,you're probably right
12-01-2018T01:36:47,Ordithus,"He has acheived enlightenment, and now exists on a new plane~"
12-01-2018T01:37:00,unsteddyphoenix,That would be pretty swordart-y

12-01-2018T01:42:51,SageSaga,she meant to whisper it to me
12-01-2018T01:43:09,Gelter,"oh, you just spelled whisper wrong"
12-01-2018T01:48:34,unsteddyphoenix,(totally not his idea)

12-01-2018T02:08:33,SageSaga,thats why we dont color at 72dpi
12-01-2018T02:09:14,SageSaga,the only things i do at 72dpi are saving for posting and sketching
12-01-2018T02:10:18,ZRO4825,"Makes sense to me. I just went with it cuz it's what it defaulted to after I did a New from clipboard, lol"

12-01-2018T14:35:33,BrunoYcaro,lol
12-01-2018T14:36:05,DevlNuK,"Hi people, good afternoon to all."
12-01-2018T14:36:22,Dinoman515,'Ello

12-01-2018T14:37:25,MidnightBlue78,@Twokinds Dev is the one that did the art
12-01-2018T14:37:42,BrunoYcaro,freakin knew it
12-01-2018T14:37:42,DevlNuK,"Tom what do you think, I made a drawing of Natani I hope you like it  https://devnuk.deviantart.com/art/Natani-By-Devnuk-725378957"
12-01-2018T14:40:56,Twokinds,"Wow, nice work!"
12-01-2018T14:41:22,MidnightBlue78,"oh, and you drew the mana crystal necklace too Dev!"
12-01-2018T14:41:28,DevlNuK,: D
12-01-2018T14:41:49,Twokinds,Looks really good
12-01-2018T14:42:27,DevlNuK,tnx tom I'm learning to draw by watching your streams.
12-01-2018T14:42:53,BrunoYcaro,wish i had a digital tablet
12-01-2018T14:43:17,DevlNuK,but it was with a mouse xd
12-01-2018T14:43:36,BrunoYcaro,iknow but feels strange to go from traditional to digital with it
12-01-2018T14:43:48,BrunoYcaro,doesnt feel natural
12-01-2018T14:44:33,Dinoman515,I wouldn't define digital as natural...
12-01-2018T14:44:51,BadFoMo,While we are talking about art; would it be weird to request something like this (and two other textures) for an experiment? https://www.tophattwaffle.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Capture.jpg
12-01-2018T14:48:57,DevlNuK,I can use this for future arts thanks FoMo
12-01-2018T14:51:27,BadFoMo,"That was really meant for tom, but if you want to make your own Detail Props, have fun."
12-01-2018T14:52:46,DevlNuK,xd
12-01-2018T14:57:58,Twokinds,I don't think I'd do something like that for a sketch stream
12-01-2018T15:02:03,DevlNuK,:thinking:
12-01-2018T15:32:26,BadFoMo,"@Twokinds Alright, cool."
12-01-2018T16:14:58,Twokinds,"Picarto stupidly removed the option to hide the userlist when using the popout chat, from what I can tell."
12-01-2018T16:17:10,DevlNuK,It's getting horrible like youtube.
12-01-2018T16:18:36,DevlNuK,: T
12-01-2018T16:25:54,Dinoman515,What are you talking about?
12-01-2018T16:26:12,Dinoman515,YouTube's always been horrible.
12-01-2018T16:26:39,Dinoman515,It's just gotten worse in the past years.
12-01-2018T16:27:05,DevlNuK,true
12-01-2018T16:43:18,Combak,What would you want the textures and stuff for FoMo?
12-01-2018T16:49:49,BadFoMo,@Combak This.
