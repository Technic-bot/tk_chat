04-11-2018T00:06:33,RimaDraws,good job
04-11-2018T00:06:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I think the infinite scrolling was started with that fb update
04-11-2018T00:07:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Then everything followed the garbage truck down the hill
04-11-2018T00:07:12,GhostPack24,Just wondering Did you guys see what i wrote?
04-11-2018T00:07:21,totallynotTrace,"its funny, ive scrolled for so long on facebook a few times that it just tells me there is nothing left"

04-11-2018T00:31:14,GhostPack24,?
04-11-2018T00:31:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"Everyone wants to see the now, and going backwards just takes time you can put towards another feed"

04-11-2018T15:42:15,Mippy,I tried to get baby Kat...but it was always second in the votes. :ctwokinds-katwet:
04-11-2018T15:42:45,Mippy,(And young Eric)
04-11-2018T15:44:35,Xexanoth,wasn't there a baby flora sketch once?(might just have been a suggestion though)
04-11-2018T15:45:48,Mippy,I‚Äôm not sure ü§î
04-11-2018T15:48:28,TerraTheWizard,not had any babby flora drawn afaik
04-11-2018T15:50:49,Xexanoth,did a quick search and couldn't find anything
04-11-2018T15:52:25,ThingsAreMoving,me neither
04-11-2018T15:52:35,Mippy,This week : Twokinds Babies!

04-11-2018T15:53:45,TerraTheWizard,pls no
04-11-2018T15:53:46,Mippy,(Or possibly a pole dancing Alabaster...if my cold induced immigration continues to be like it was yesterday)
04-11-2018T15:54:10,ThingsAreMoving,immigration or imagination? :ctwokinds-floraquestion:
04-11-2018T15:54:24,TerraTheWizard,so what d'ya think the chance we'll have some deltarune suggestions in the polls this week
04-11-2018T15:54:53,ThingsAreMoving,"I'd say pretty low, maybe one or two"
04-11-2018T15:55:31,ThingsAreMoving,"I'm sticking to my youngtani, it was pretty high in the polls last time."
04-11-2018T15:56:00,Mippy,*Imagination ...I‚Äôm on Mobile...autocorrects happens
04-11-2018T15:56:21,TerraTheWizard,i gots a sealeen suggestion ready for this week :3c
04-11-2018T15:57:02,ThingsAreMoving,...ceiling
04-11-2018T15:57:18,TerraTheWizard,leeeeeeeeeen
04-11-2018T15:57:24,Mippy,My poor suggestions never get higher than second...It‚Äôs only a matter of time until I get a sketch
04-11-2018T15:57:41,TerraTheWizard,2nd is good
04-11-2018T15:57:48,TerraTheWizard,my suggestions usually get 6th or lower
04-11-2018T15:57:52,Mippy,Maybe I‚Äôll keep pushing nude beach
04-11-2018T15:58:28,THETOXICATOR,Yes
04-11-2018T15:58:31,Mippy,Then go back to baby Kat...as those are the two that did the best
04-11-2018T15:58:58,THETOXICATOR,Sealeen suggestion
04-11-2018T16:01:59,Mippy,"I keep wanting to make suggestions with characters like Aster Alabaster and Lynn, but I know they are not very popular and don‚Äôt get drawn that much :ctwokinds-sadtrace2:"
04-11-2018T16:02:59,Twokinds,"yeah, that's the problem with popular vote."
04-11-2018T16:03:10,Twokinds,Some things just don't have as much of a chance inately.
04-11-2018T16:09:17,iliar,Another problem is fan service. I love fan service. But an interesting idea just has no chance if together with it in the pool there is a suggestion like &ldquo;Sexy Adira&rdquo;.
04-11-2018T16:09:34,FennexTheFox,"yeah, it sucks sometimes. i wanna see some FtM gender shenanigans too"
04-11-2018T16:10:18,SpazztasticKiwi,New Years idea: baby new years Nibbly
04-11-2018T16:10:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Or Flora
04-11-2018T16:10:49,ThingsAreMoving,There's always a chance that your suggestion might be the best one in current poll
04-11-2018T16:11:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I can‚Äôt suggest rn
04-11-2018T16:11:08,SpazztasticKiwi,On the chill
04-11-2018T16:11:09,ThingsAreMoving,sometimes i feel like there's nothing I'd like to vote for and other times there's like 9 of them
04-11-2018T16:11:20,Dadrobit,Young Flora: https://imgur.com/a/nKrGuFx
04-11-2018T16:11:21,TerraTheWizard,myup
04-11-2018T16:11:40,ThingsAreMoving,"Nice find, dad"
04-11-2018T16:11:49,ThingsAreMoving,"wow, 13 years ago"
04-11-2018T16:11:57,TerraTheWizard,thems a smol flor
04-11-2018T16:13:24,BadFoMo,"@iliar I think I've had that problem myself. I'm like "" Dude! Quit puting mine with the ones that are almost pre-deturmened to win!""."
04-11-2018T16:15:04,TerraTheWizard,unluck of the draw
04-11-2018T16:15:37,Dadrobit,"Yeah, still trying to get Ember in, but when I see it paired against stuff like ""lesbian bar"" it's just like, alright better luck next time."
04-11-2018T16:16:34,Twokinds,haha
04-11-2018T16:18:46,BadFoMo,"...Also, if popularity has a hand in the voting, then why did Thriller have to be a Tom pick? ...And my NaKdat (which also had the cute 'Snow Mew' in it) lose so bad?"
04-11-2018T16:18:46,Twokinds,"It blows my mind to think that there's been over 500 sketches, but so many factors go into them getting made and how I choose to draw them in the moment."
04-11-2018T16:18:56,ThingsAreMoving,Whenever I suggest something I try to gauge how likely it is going to be voted for or picked by Tom.
04-11-2018T16:19:05,ThingsAreMoving,Can't complain so far. :ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
04-11-2018T16:19:09,Twokinds,"In another world, with slightly different variables, there might be 500 different sketches than the ones we have."
04-11-2018T16:19:48,Dadrobit,"Thriller is a case of ""They don't know what they want until they're given it."""
04-11-2018T16:20:06,ThingsAreMoving,It was a rare gem
04-11-2018T16:20:08,THETOXICATOR,I want more sketches about sealeen & co
04-11-2018T16:20:10,ThingsAreMoving,"unexpected, but welcome"
04-11-2018T16:20:29,BadFoMo,But... they should know what Thrillir is!
04-11-2018T16:20:37,BadFoMo,*Thriller
04-11-2018T16:20:44,Dadrobit,"7 out of 11 of my sketches were ""popular"" enough to eventually get colored, but only 2 have actually won the ""popular vote"""
04-11-2018T16:20:49,ThingsAreMoving,"Depends on audience's age, FoMo"
04-11-2018T16:21:07,Dadrobit,It's a right mess
04-11-2018T16:21:46,ThingsAreMoving,4 out of 4 of mine were Tom's pick
04-11-2018T16:21:49,Twokinds,"A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one."
04-11-2018T16:21:57,Dadrobit,\o/
04-11-2018T16:23:18,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-clovischuckle:
04-11-2018T16:24:03,ThingsAreMoving,"Tom, what do you think about getting 5th color sketch as your pick?"
04-11-2018T16:24:59,Dadrobit,"Still have a heck of a long ways to catch unsteddy, and quite frankly, I'm not sure how without throwing pandas at the audience..."
04-11-2018T16:25:40,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
04-11-2018T16:25:44,ThingsAreMoving,"Don't throw pandas please, they've stopped being an endangered species only recently."
04-11-2018T16:25:56,ThingsAreMoving,Let them prosper for a WHILE
04-11-2018T16:26:05,ThingsAreMoving,"whoops, caps"
04-11-2018T16:26:10,TerraTheWizard,i've still not found the count issue in my stats sheet
04-11-2018T16:26:29,TerraTheWizard,somehow my sketches count & the tagged count don't line up
04-11-2018T16:26:43,Mippy,You guys are lucky. XD I haven‚Äôt got a single sketch :ctwokinds-karenOOO:
04-11-2018T16:26:45,TerraTheWizard,and i can't tell if i miscounted or there's sketches untagged
04-11-2018T16:26:52,BadFoMo,Plus those are still /Bears/!
04-11-2018T16:27:19,Mippy,It‚Äôs only a matter of time :ctwokinds-clovischuckle:
04-11-2018T16:28:21,BadFoMo,@Mippy Same...
04-11-2018T16:28:52,Dadrobit,"You are currently sitting at 6, FoMo."
04-11-2018T16:29:46,BadFoMo,With 2 colors.
04-11-2018T16:30:02,TerraTheWizard,"speaking of stats, i made a count of which nor-card people got colours of which characters"
04-11-2018T16:30:06,TerraTheWizard,*nora
04-11-2018T16:30:09,TerraTheWizard,https://pastebin.com/SkPt2vgm
04-11-2018T16:30:14,Dadrobit,I spent way too goddamn long last night sorting an excel sheet with every single sketch done to their respective suggesters... But at least now I know.
04-11-2018T16:30:41,TerraTheWizard,"and basically for character variation, iliar = mvp"
04-11-2018T16:30:46,Dadrobit,Nice
04-11-2018T16:32:17,TerraTheWizard,and here's the stats sheet i made https://pastebin.com/FCEN3mQ4
04-11-2018T16:32:30,TerraTheWizard,"with the bonus ""things unsteddy got called"" part"
04-11-2018T16:33:33,Mippy,So...dose the winner get a date (or bro date) with Tom? :ctwokinds-floraquestion:
04-11-2018T16:34:24,Dadrobit,The winner certainly paid for the meal.
04-11-2018T16:34:27,TerraTheWizard,"but yeah, on that you can see my count is 4 more than the tag"
04-11-2018T16:34:41,TerraTheWizard,and i can't figure out where that happened
04-11-2018T16:35:10,TerraTheWizard,likely it's because i made that stats page months ago while ill
04-11-2018T16:35:25,TerraTheWizard,and miscounted by adding a bonus sketch to the count
04-11-2018T16:35:33,TerraTheWizard,4 times...
04-11-2018T16:36:02,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I counted the bonuses and alt versions in my count. https://i.imgur.com/gFbSTv2.png"
04-11-2018T16:36:23,TerraTheWizard,holy granoli
04-11-2018T16:36:40,Dadrobit,It just keeps going to the right....
04-11-2018T16:36:44,TerraTheWizard,lol
04-11-2018T16:36:46,BadFoMo,5.5?
04-11-2018T16:36:57,iliar,@Dadrobit https://yadi.sk/i/ak1tCr9FjK0NlQ
04-11-2018T16:37:08,TerraTheWizard,if 2 people get credited with a sketch the 1 point gets split
04-11-2018T16:37:09,Dadrobit,lol
04-11-2018T16:37:23,TerraTheWizard,"like, with my one i'm credited with 3.333"
04-11-2018T16:37:24,Mippy,Dang Dad...that is impossible to read on mobile
04-11-2018T16:37:32,TerraTheWizard,because the pirate zen sketch was split 3 ways
04-11-2018T16:37:32,Xexanoth,"what's this, a spreadsheet for ants?"
04-11-2018T16:37:46,Dadrobit,"Don't worry, it's impossible to read on a desktop as well"
04-11-2018T16:37:48,TerraTheWizard,(and i had 3 other wins)
04-11-2018T16:37:51,Dadrobit,It's just for scale
04-11-2018T16:38:15,BadFoMo,@TerraTheWizard Oh; ...that makes sence.
04-11-2018T16:39:01,TerraTheWizard,"i'd go through patreon and check my count, but patreon is so laggy"
04-11-2018T16:39:11,TerraTheWizard,infinite scrolling was a terrible design  choice
04-11-2018T16:41:12,Xexanoth,"doesn't patreon have an option to give ""x post per page"""
04-11-2018T16:41:52,TerraTheWizard,not that i've seen
04-11-2018T16:41:59,ThingsAreMoving,Unfteddy has many more nicknames
04-11-2018T16:42:16,ThingsAreMoving,"that list is impressive, but a bit outdated"
04-11-2018T16:42:26,ZRO4825,"No it doesn't Xex, much to the dismay of many considering after like 3 or 4 ""scrolls"" of content it gets laggy as HELL"
04-11-2018T16:42:41,TerraTheWizard,the list doesn't have the names that showed up in images
04-11-2018T16:42:49,TerraTheWizard,just the ones in the descriptions
04-11-2018T16:43:00,ThingsAreMoving,oooooh
04-11-2018T16:43:03,BadFoMo,@TerraTheWizard Definetly for when you're on a percon's profile and you want to look through their comments. It juse keep going back to the top of the page when it loads more.
04-11-2018T16:43:07,TerraTheWizard,if it had the ones in images there'd be like 7 more
04-11-2018T16:43:37,ThingsAreMoving,impressive list nonetheless
04-11-2018T16:43:40,Xexanoth,"well, i guess just filter by months, that limits the posts"
04-11-2018T16:43:51,TerraTheWizard,"i did that, it's still laggy"
04-11-2018T16:44:03,iliar,@TerraTheWizard Hmm ... I see in this list my unpublished cards are not counted.
04-11-2018T16:44:31,TerraTheWizard,only counted the stuff that's on patreon
04-11-2018T16:45:21,iliar,"In unpublished cards: Mave +2, Adira +1, Sam +1, Colin +1, Natani +1, Reni +1, Basitin Girl +1, Nora +1, Madelyn +1"
04-11-2018T16:45:50,TerraTheWizard,o.o
04-11-2018T16:45:54,ThingsAreMoving,that's a lot of unpublished stuff
04-11-2018T16:47:43,Mippy,:ctwokinds-karenOOO:
04-11-2018T16:47:53,Mippy,Iliar
04-11-2018T16:48:12,Xexanoth,"10 chars, if we assume some pics with 2 characters prolly around 7 pics"
