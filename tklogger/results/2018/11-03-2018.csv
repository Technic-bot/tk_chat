11-03-2018T00:00:32,Vatruvius,Well...it no longer takes two in today's world but I get what you mean.
11-03-2018T00:00:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not taking on a kid alone
11-03-2018T00:01:29,Vatruvius,Yup...^
11-03-2018T00:01:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"Even if I do get married, having a kid may very well be because something broke"
11-03-2018T00:02:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Lady I work with has a granddaughter that just had her first baby
11-03-2018T00:03:02,Vatruvius,"I plan to have kids eventually, when the time is right. I just hope that time would be a few years into the marriage."
11-03-2018T00:03:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"Not only did they have to induce labor, she lost two liters of blood in the birth"
11-03-2018T00:03:48,SpazztasticKiwi,No. Thanks.
11-03-2018T00:04:23,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:
11-03-2018T00:04:36,Vatruvius,Ah...that does not sound right. Something go wrong? Sea section?
11-03-2018T00:04:54,unsteddyphoenix,Sea section lmao
11-03-2018T00:05:06,unsteddyphoenix,:ocean::ocean::ocean::ocean:
11-03-2018T00:05:16,Vatruvius,Brain is officially off right now
11-03-2018T00:05:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I think so. I didn’t want to push for information
11-03-2018T00:06:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe they exaggerated but I still don’t want any of that mess
11-03-2018T00:06:34,Vatruvius,"Alright, I am curious. How old is everyone here really? I figure we are all within 7 or 8 years of each other though Tom is closer to 10 for me."
11-03-2018T00:06:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I can drink legally
11-03-2018T00:06:51,wolfspartan1,ello
11-03-2018T00:07:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Unsteddy’s about 24 I believe
11-03-2018T00:08:43,Dadrobit,"Okay, something is officially fucked in my neck. Just took some Tylenol PM and benadryl, gonna sleep this off asap I think."
11-03-2018T00:08:46,Vatruvius,That is a rather broad answer Kiwi
11-03-2018T00:10:50,Dadrobit,And I'm old enough to have gone through college and alerady be well on my way in a career field had I not fucked up so much earlier on.
11-03-2018T00:12:34,Vatruvius,"Lol...all ages in ambiguity yet willing offer the age of others. Well, I am old enough to graduate high school!"
11-03-2018T00:13:06,unsteddyphoenix,Same dad~
11-03-2018T00:13:06,wolfspartan1,i'm 21
11-03-2018T00:13:46,Vatruvius,"Hey wolf, didn't see your greeting earlier."
11-03-2018T00:14:18,Dadrobit,Okay I'm going to go lie down and die now.
11-03-2018T00:14:24,Dadrobit,Maybe get some sleep too
11-03-2018T00:14:32,Vatruvius,Night @Dadrobit
11-03-2018T00:14:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Well there’s at least one person that my age
11-03-2018T00:14:37,unsteddyphoenix,good luck have fun~ &lt;3
11-03-2018T00:14:50,Vatruvius,"So, you are 21 then Kiwi"
11-03-2018T00:15:03,SpazztasticKiwi,We’re all legal adults at least
11-03-2018T00:15:15,wolfspartan1,heya vatr
11-03-2018T00:15:21,SpazztasticKiwi,In theory
11-03-2018T00:15:27,Vatruvius,"That is true, but can I get a straight answer? 21 or no?"
11-03-2018T00:15:41,SpazztasticKiwi,21
11-03-2018T00:15:42,unsteddyphoenix,He needs it for his survey
11-03-2018T00:15:52,Vatruvius,All the surveys.
11-03-2018T00:15:57,Vatruvius,No...I am 20
11-03-2018T00:16:34,SpazztasticKiwi,So technically we’re all closer in age to each other that Tom is to us
11-03-2018T00:16:53,Vatruvius,Yes
11-03-2018T00:17:07,Vatruvius,Tom is the old man here
11-03-2018T00:17:21,SpazztasticKiwi,To be fair 30 isn’t old
11-03-2018T00:17:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Not terribly old anyway
11-03-2018T00:18:12,unsteddyphoenix,i would hope not...
11-03-2018T00:18:16,Dadrobit,"Before I go, no, I am closer to Tom than you."
11-03-2018T00:18:17,SpazztasticKiwi,And you’re only as old as you feel (or act)
11-03-2018T00:18:25,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake: GET OFF MAH LAWN
11-03-2018T00:18:36,Vatruvius,"Na...don't take this away from me. I want to insult him...wait...he can ban me...I am really sorry Tom. You are very young, quite handsome I am sure, and a beautiful person."
11-03-2018T00:18:53,SpazztasticKiwi,You must be an elderly grandpa before you can use that line
11-03-2018T00:19:01,Dadrobit,"Well, I just injured myself dancing to the point of need=ing to go to bed early, what does that say?"
11-03-2018T00:19:17,SpazztasticKiwi,You didn’t stretch
11-03-2018T00:19:22,zolstarym,"After 30 it's all pretty much downhill. Constantly getting slower, you can feel the dementia coming on. Bones creaking with every movement"
11-03-2018T00:19:41,unsteddyphoenix,Can I stay if I have back pain? I can get some...
11-03-2018T00:19:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Jesus you people act like it’s the end of the world
11-03-2018T00:19:49,Vatruvius,Well someone has been stalking our conversation.
11-03-2018T00:19:51,zolstarym,Have you bought a cane yet tom?
11-03-2018T00:20:10,Vatruvius,I would hope not at 30ish
11-03-2018T00:20:18,unsteddyphoenix,What if I have some rowdy youths dirtying up my lawn then can I use it?
11-03-2018T00:21:00,Vatruvius,Always
11-03-2018T00:21:09,SpazztasticKiwi,It is a line for the grumpy old man of the neighborhood that’s grumpy because his grandchildren don’t visit
11-03-2018T00:22:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Then again it also depends if your neighborhood even has kids or if it’s an older neighborhood
11-03-2018T00:22:51,Dadrobit,:( I have a cane...
11-03-2018T00:23:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Aren’t you like 26 or something
11-03-2018T00:23:12,zolstarym,Is it oak? Those ones are the best
11-03-2018T00:23:21,Vatruvius,"No...that is a line from Clint Eastwood I believe. He played an old man in a neighborhood, can't remember what the movie was about."
11-03-2018T00:23:31,Dadrobit,"Don't need it more often than not, still sucks though."
11-03-2018T00:23:32,unsteddyphoenix,Oooh nice dad
11-03-2018T00:23:46,unsteddyphoenix,But does it have a sword in it
11-03-2018T00:23:57,unsteddyphoenix,Or fire devals like House
11-03-2018T00:23:59,unsteddyphoenix,decals
11-03-2018T00:24:02,Dadrobit,"Naw, I wish."
11-03-2018T00:24:08,unsteddyphoenix,unfort
11-03-2018T00:24:52,SpazztasticKiwi,If there’s kids around my neighborhood they are LOST
11-03-2018T00:25:08,Dadrobit,"Got it in highschool, refused to use the old man Walker I got from the doctor."
11-03-2018T00:25:15,SpazztasticKiwi,We live in the woods
11-03-2018T00:25:41,Vatruvius,"Me too, though, there are kids in the houses nearby."
11-03-2018T00:25:41,Dadrobit,It was social suicide.
11-03-2018T00:26:00,unsteddyphoenix,It would be
11-03-2018T00:26:07,unsteddyphoenix,A cane on the other hand is just cool~
11-03-2018T00:26:15,Dadrobit,"You can rock a cane, look like pimp."
11-03-2018T00:26:24,Dadrobit,"Walkers, not so much."
11-03-2018T00:26:29,iliar,@zolstarym: It seems to me a cane for young people. Young feet still work well. After 30 it is necessary already to think about the wheelchair.
11-03-2018T00:27:04,Vatruvius,That comment just makes me sad.
11-03-2018T00:27:10,zolstarym,On the bright side: handicap parking!
11-03-2018T00:27:44,Dadrobit,"No, I outright refuse to get that before I'm 40."
11-03-2018T00:27:58,unsteddyphoenix,Ay man take those perks
11-03-2018T00:28:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Guys. 30 is only nine years away from me. Chill - that’s like dating range
11-03-2018T00:28:05,zolstarym,It can be hard to find good parking at farmers market and applebees
11-03-2018T00:28:39,unsteddyphoenix,Spazz you are like a small babby. :ctwokinds-kingtea:
11-03-2018T00:28:41,Vatruvius,I will cry if I need eternal assistance if I reach the age of even 50
11-03-2018T00:28:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Be worried when you stand up and your hip cracks like it’s coming out of socket
11-03-2018T00:29:02,Vatruvius,external*
11-03-2018T00:29:23,SpazztasticKiwi,You keep this mentality up and you will age faster
11-03-2018T00:30:07,Dadrobit,"S'why I try to keep relatively healthy, stave off the old as much as I can."
11-03-2018T00:30:13,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake:
11-03-2018T00:30:16,Vatruvius,I will not age...I will not age...I will not age!
11-03-2018T00:30:37,Vatruvius,The little Vatru that could
11-03-2018T00:30:57,SpazztasticKiwi,You’re only about three years older than me. Contain yourself unsteddy
11-03-2018T00:31:13,Dadrobit,Old boi
11-03-2018T00:31:42,unsteddyphoenix,Back in MY day you youths had RESPECT :ctwokinds-katwet:
11-03-2018T00:32:42,Dadrobit,*shows the one character that will never create youths that will respect her*
11-03-2018T00:32:55,Vatruvius,"You saying I have no respect, how have I shown disrespect?"
11-03-2018T00:33:09,unsteddyphoenix,...aw.
11-03-2018T00:33:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I thought it was just covered 30 was old so twenties are effectively middle age
11-03-2018T00:33:28,Dadrobit,I'm sorry unsteddy.
11-03-2018T00:33:53,unsteddyphoenix,Now im just sad. :ctwokinds-LauraCry:
11-03-2018T00:34:27,Vatruvius,"Don't give me that Laura face, I can't stand it. God...I am just like Keith."
11-03-2018T00:34:34,Dadrobit,Look on the bright side! She was never real in the first place!
11-03-2018T00:34:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"In theory, she could try finding a surrogate mother"
11-03-2018T00:34:58,unsteddyphoenix,...I have to go lie down...
11-03-2018T00:35:05,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe...curl up into a ball...
11-03-2018T00:35:07,SpazztasticKiwi,If their medical know how is that level
11-03-2018T00:35:24,Vatruvius,What?
11-03-2018T00:35:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"You know, someone else carrying her baby to term for her"
11-03-2018T00:35:53,Dadrobit,Doesn't take a lot of science to tell your SO to screw someone else who ~can~ have kids.
11-03-2018T00:36:07,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s not what happens
11-03-2018T00:36:25,Vatruvius,Ohh...I get it now.
11-03-2018T00:37:00,Vatruvius,"What, I think I get it?"
11-03-2018T00:37:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"They take the mans DNA and combine it with an egg from the lady (or donated egg if the lady is infertile), and plant the fertilized egg in a woman who has volunteered to carry the baby"
11-03-2018T00:37:23,Dadrobit,"Eric! Go get Raine real quick, I have a project for you two!"
11-03-2018T00:37:26,Vatruvius,"You talking about someone else carrying their baby, like adoption but preconceived?"
11-03-2018T00:37:54,Vatruvius,"Woah...now, now @Dadrobit"
11-03-2018T00:38:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Let’s say John and Jane want a kid and a woman named Lisa is a certified surrogate mother
11-03-2018T00:39:21,SpazztasticKiwi,They take DNA from John and an egg from Jane (or a doner egg/male DNA of either is infertile)
11-03-2018T00:39:47,Vatruvius,"I think that does happen, though I am not sure how her body would be able to support the embryo if their genetic make up is so vastly different. You would have to hope the blood type is compatible."
11-03-2018T00:40:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"They combine those in a lab and once fertilization is successful, they plant the growing egg in Jane to develop"
11-03-2018T00:40:28,Dadrobit,What you fail to realize here Kiwi is that I am currently two glasses in and on several different sleepy time aids. Nothing that you can come up with will convince me that the best case for Kat is asking for a friend to do a favor.
11-03-2018T00:40:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"I mean Lisa, they put the growing egg in Lisa"
11-03-2018T00:40:44,Dadrobit,Isn't*
11-03-2018T00:41:46,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s why I mentioned Lisa is a certified surrogate mother. Her blood type and physical as well as physiological evals have approved her to do what she’s volunteering for
11-03-2018T00:42:04,Dadrobit,My response? Magic.
11-03-2018T00:42:14,Vatruvius,Lisa would have to be O-
11-03-2018T00:42:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"When they look for a surrogate, they screen for this stuff"
11-03-2018T00:42:50,Dadrobit,"Dude got a baby from screwing a tiger, really not convinced physiological evals are needed here."
11-03-2018T00:43:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"Or a blood type matching Jane, I think would be possible too"
11-03-2018T00:43:33,Vatruvius,"I am sure they do, but it certainly is not at all often enough to allow this to happen for those who are sterile. It just has not undergone enough testing/use I do not think."
11-03-2018T00:43:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"Yes, the tiger/human child and the fact this is a magical world factors in too"
11-03-2018T00:43:54,Dadrobit,Taadaàa
11-03-2018T00:44:10,SpazztasticKiwi,That seems to mainly prove that Keidran and humans have the same chromosomal count
11-03-2018T00:44:14,Vatruvius,"So, are we talking about this subject or just about the comic?"
11-03-2018T00:44:26,Dadrobit,Or it proves that magic is real.
11-03-2018T00:44:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Or Trace or Flora isn’t purely human or purely Keidran
11-03-2018T00:45:24,Dadrobit,"Screw reality Vat, the real world Carris only sadness and neck injuries."
11-03-2018T00:45:40,Dadrobit,Carries*
11-03-2018T00:45:42,Vatruvius,"If we are talking about the comic, for one thing the masks made their races similar to each other. This mean life is rather similar to each other, i.e. DNA, etc."
11-03-2018T00:46:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"This is true, but one has a chromosome that causes fur growth and other animal characteristics"
11-03-2018T00:46:50,SpazztasticKiwi,That may be the only difference though
11-03-2018T00:47:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Or we’re just overthinking this
11-03-2018T00:47:19,Vatruvius,Mammals share a large percentage of DNA with each other that branches out. Keidran and Basitins are clearly mammals like humans.
11-03-2018T00:47:37,Dadrobit,"Riiiiight, not like they have vastly different bodies or anything."
11-03-2018T00:47:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom are overthinking this
11-03-2018T00:48:16,Dadrobit,*cough cough* tailsandsnoutsforstarters *cough cough*
11-03-2018T00:48:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Or are you eating popcorn as we discuss this
11-03-2018T00:48:40,Vatruvius,"In either case, if appears to me they are able to bread feasible offspring as in the comic Neutral said there was a race she had not allowed which meant that a god was using her power to prevent feasible offspring from happening."
11-03-2018T00:49:00,Dadrobit,"""bread"" :thinking:"
11-03-2018T00:49:31,Vatruvius,They have to be feasible for a god to not allow it.
11-03-2018T00:49:38,Dadrobit,I guess you could say Flora's got one baking in the oven.
11-03-2018T00:49:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Or 4 yeast rolls
11-03-2018T00:49:59,Dadrobit,"Though after all these years, it might be a little burnt..."
11-03-2018T00:50:35,Vatruvius,It is a very slow oven.
11-03-2018T00:51:04,Vatruvius,"Like during thanksgiving, the turkey may take 14 hours but it will be great afterwards."
11-03-2018T00:51:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Well this may be the most gorgeous child anyone’s ever seen by that logic
11-03-2018T00:52:14,Vatruvius,"Honestly, it is 2am for Tom right now. I do not know his sleep pattern but he usually ends his streams then in the youtube videos."
11-03-2018T00:53:03,Dadrobit,"Spatch cock that turkey yo, done in an hour."
11-03-2018T00:53:31,Dadrobit,Tastes way better too I'm home.
11-03-2018T00:53:37,Dadrobit,Imho*
11-03-2018T00:54:13,Vatruvius,"I don't cook it, my mom does. If I had to cook a turkey for 14 hours + prep, I would lose my mind."
11-03-2018T00:54:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I think your English is broken
11-03-2018T00:54:40,Dadrobit,That's what I'm saying. There's a better way!
11-03-2018T00:55:33,Vatruvius,I know I may spell some things wrong but hey...wait...are you talking about @Dadrobit
11-03-2018T00:55:57,Dadrobit,https://www.marthastewart.com/275445/how-to-spatchcock-a-turkey
11-03-2018T00:56:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Had to read it twice before my brain was sure I read what I read
11-03-2018T00:56:27,TheBeckoner,Heyo
11-03-2018T00:56:32,Vatruvius,Hey
11-03-2018T00:57:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Unnecessary space then. Also it says this method “cuts down on time”? How?
11-03-2018T00:57:21,SpazztasticKiwi,14 hours isn’t a cut in time
11-03-2018T00:57:40,Dadrobit,Done in 2 hours
11-03-2018T00:57:54,Vatruvius,For a second I thought you sent a link for how to cook a turkey on a math site as my calculus book is Stewart Calculus.
11-03-2018T00:58:23,Dadrobit,You flatten out the turkey so the heat hits all of it at once and doesn't spend a ton of time trying to penetrate it.
11-03-2018T00:58:38,Vatruvius,"So, spam?"
11-03-2018T00:58:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"That is a cut down, I guess, especially since my chicken and dumplings take about 3 hours"
11-03-2018T00:59:07,Dadrobit,Though you do need a stronger stomach. Need to cut out it's spine and break it's ribs.
11-03-2018T00:59:26,Vatruvius,:ptv-grossedout:
11-03-2018T00:59:50,Dadrobit,"And it's 2 hours tops. I don't do huge turkies, mine only takes an hour."
11-03-2018T00:59:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve handled raw chicken before. And seen a fish gutted
11-03-2018T00:59:59,Vatruvius,"Okay, not really. I had to cut a rooster's head off and my mom boils chicken legs quite regularly."
11-03-2018T01:00:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Not terribly disturbing to me
11-03-2018T01:00:28,TheBeckoner,I butchered chickens once. Interesting process.
11-03-2018T01:00:33,Vatruvius,"Does not mean my stomach does not change though, I can do it, just not really wanting to."
11-03-2018T01:00:41,SpazztasticKiwi,As long as you do it humanely
11-03-2018T01:01:06,Dadrobit,"Yeah, but there is something intrinsically wrong about crushing a ribcage the first time you do it."
11-03-2018T01:01:20,Dadrobit,Just feels bad.
11-03-2018T01:01:37,Dadrobit,"And same, grew up with chickens."
11-03-2018T01:02:22,Vatruvius,"Yeah, cutting off a rooster's head is human, but they still run around bleeding everywhere. Not something my 11 year old self wanted to see"
11-03-2018T01:02:26,Dadrobit,It's like crushing a toddler.
11-03-2018T01:02:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Interesting analogy
11-03-2018T01:03:24,Dadrobit,"Thanks, these sleepy time meds can't work fast enough..."
11-03-2018T01:03:42,Vatruvius,Helps when you leave the computer and lay in bed.
11-03-2018T01:03:47,TheBeckoner,"woa Robit ""crushing a toddler"""
11-03-2018T01:03:50,TheBeckoner,lol

11-03-2018T01:03:59,SpazztasticKiwi,*mom voice* they’d work better if you were in bed
11-03-2018T01:04:26,Dadrobit,You can call me daddy.
11-03-2018T01:04:45,Dadrobit,(you walked into that one)
11-03-2018T01:05:18,SpazztasticKiwi,You know what cracks me up? Mark mentioned to their mom that he had night terrors and she gave the most “mom” answer ever: “it’s those video games you play”
11-03-2018T01:05:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Still not calling you that
11-03-2018T01:05:47,Vatruvius,Mark as in...
11-03-2018T01:05:59,Vatruvius,I am with her on that one @Dadrobit
11-03-2018T01:06:02,Dadrobit,Probably moreso the people that follow him.
11-03-2018T01:06:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom’s brother, yes"
11-03-2018T01:06:31,Dadrobit,Y'all are missing out. I hear it's very liberating.
11-03-2018T01:07:02,SpazztasticKiwi,The only person I ever called daddy was my dad
11-03-2018T01:07:21,Dadrobit,So far....
11-03-2018T01:07:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh it’ll stay that way
11-03-2018T01:07:48,Vatruvius,"I don't even call my dad daddy, that was when I was really young. Though maybe that is a father son thing."
11-03-2018T01:08:13,Dadrobit,Still call grandaddy as such.
11-03-2018T01:08:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe
11-03-2018T01:09:57,Dadrobit,"Only call pops ""daddy"" when I'm veritably drowning him in sarcasm"
11-03-2018T01:10:17,Vatruvius,Holy ****!
11-03-2018T01:10:21,Vatruvius,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3VTgIPoGU
11-03-2018T01:10:38,Dadrobit,"Shit, he's probably called me daddy more in recent years."
11-03-2018T01:20:21,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s gotten to the point where I refer to my dad by his name anymore
11-03-2018T01:21:15,SpazztasticKiwi,People that knew him say I favor him alot
11-03-2018T01:24:00,Vatruvius,Meaning you still refer to him as dad or by his given name?
11-03-2018T01:24:55,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
11-03-2018T01:27:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Both. Depends on the conversation and who I’m talking to
11-03-2018T01:28:40,unsteddyphoenix,"What if you had to refer to dadrobit to someone who only knew him as ""daddy"""
11-03-2018T01:29:13,SpazztasticKiwi,You mean my sister?

11-03-2018T01:29:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Who I talk to with his given name vs dad for my dad
11-03-2018T01:30:19,Vatruvius,Was that just a poor timing of comments or...?
11-03-2018T01:30:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"Because with my sister, it’s dad. With his siblings and people who knew him, it’s his name"
11-03-2018T01:30:30,unsteddyphoenix,brb dying :ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
11-03-2018T01:30:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Very poor timing
11-03-2018T01:31:53,SpazztasticKiwi,But it only starts out with his name - it changes to “dad” as the conversation goes on
11-03-2018T01:32:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"But with Dadrobit, I’d likely use “Dadrobit”"
11-03-2018T01:32:37,unsteddyphoenix,Unlike your sister
11-03-2018T01:33:02,Vatruvius,Okay...I was just like...!?!
11-03-2018T01:33:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"If they didn’t understand who i was talking about then, I’d say “the friend you know as ‘daddy’”"
11-03-2018T01:33:21,Vatruvius,You are lucky Dadrobit fell asleep by the looks of things.
11-03-2018T01:33:43,Vatruvius,You would never hear the end of it.
11-03-2018T01:33:46,unsteddyphoenix,"""the artist formerly known as daddy"""
11-03-2018T01:34:26,SpazztasticKiwi,She’d likely use “Dadrobit” too
11-03-2018T01:35:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"Probably should’ve said “like with my sister, it’s daddy, since it’s understood we have the same father”"
11-03-2018T01:36:07,unsteddyphoenix,Nah I like what you said better
11-03-2018T01:36:14,SpazztasticKiwi,But I have a habit of omitting words when chatting online
11-03-2018T01:37:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"And that leads to this kind of thing, especially when it’s a conversation between more than just me and one other person"
11-03-2018T01:39:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Someone else’s comment can jump in front of my thread and cause a mess in context
11-03-2018T01:39:49,unsteddyphoenix,yup that could potentially happen true
11-03-2018T01:40:27,Vatruvius,At least you omit words instead of using the texting language.
11-03-2018T01:41:57,Vatruvius,"What time is it for you guys, it is only 11:41 here."
11-03-2018T01:42:20,SpazztasticKiwi,1:42
11-03-2018T01:42:44,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s like when I said Tom didn’t strike me as one for cameras
11-03-2018T01:43:56,SpazztasticKiwi,And I followed it up with “not that he’s ugly” but so many people had commented between parts it stood isolated
11-03-2018T01:44:09,Vatruvius,I vaguely remember that being said last stream.
11-03-2018T01:44:22,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s why I block text most of the time
11-03-2018T01:44:55,Vatruvius,I just say what I can and it turns into a huge chunk of text.
11-03-2018T01:45:02,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s alot to read but it gets everything out and explained. Most of the time
11-03-2018T01:45:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I don’t think many people saw it anyway
11-03-2018T01:47:56,Vatruvius,"Yes....just got to the part where Adelaide comes into the comic. I love that Tom decided to add a strong female character to the comic, not just strong willed but also a total bad ass."
11-03-2018T01:51:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve seen “too much” confidence and ability in a woman put off people
11-03-2018T01:52:09,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s nice Adelaide is so able
11-03-2018T01:52:34,unsteddyphoenix,Ive...HEARD of that. Not sure I believe that trope.
11-03-2018T01:52:59,unsteddyphoenix,"I think sometimes people are arrogant and annoying, man or woman."
11-03-2018T01:53:25,unsteddyphoenix,But yeah I love Adelaide too~ :ctwokinds-kingtea:
11-03-2018T01:53:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"I think it’s more that the people that don’t like it, and I’ve seen it in guys primarily, is because they want the focus to be on them as the strong figure"
11-03-2018T01:54:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Or their so arrogant they can’t stand someone of equal or stronger ability
11-03-2018T01:54:15,SpazztasticKiwi,*they’re
11-03-2018T01:54:15,unsteddyphoenix,I mean...I could see random individuals thinking that
11-03-2018T01:54:47,unsteddyphoenix,In the sense that crazy people have crazy ideas sure.
11-03-2018T01:55:16,Bgrmystr2,"A lot of people out there think of women as weak and frail compared to men, which are naturally easily able to  become stronger due to body differences.. and women being stronger than them is contrary to their ""norm"" and weirds them out"
11-03-2018T01:55:22,Bgrmystr2,they don't like anything they don't understand

11-03-2018T01:55:28,Bgrmystr2,it's a very common thing
11-03-2018T01:55:41,unsteddyphoenix,Its a very common internet trope.
11-03-2018T01:55:50,Bgrmystr2,"depending on what you're in that room for, Kiwi"
11-03-2018T01:56:12,Bgrmystr2,there's a whole bunch of those rooms in these buildings where I live.. called schools :V
11-03-2018T01:56:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don’t mind someone opening a door for me, but I also know I’m able to open it myself"

11-03-2018T01:57:18,TheBeckoner,Throw horse sounds more fun
11-03-2018T01:57:29,Bgrmystr2,"Myself, Idm a girl that's strong, possibly even stronger than me. I love the confidence.. as that's true strength."
11-03-2018T01:57:46,Bgrmystr2,something I can look up to
11-03-2018T01:58:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don’t like heights, so unless there’s someone else to hold onto, I don’t get on horses"
11-03-2018T01:58:51,Bgrmystr2,"phoenix, only kings throw horses."
11-03-2018T01:59:05,Vatruvius,"I find a strong female rather attractive, kind of proves all biases wrong. Though, I cannot say I have found anyone like that that also did not feel superior to every else as well. I would die if I got in a relationship where she was a ""yes"" woman."

11-03-2018T01:59:26,Bgrmystr2,LOL
11-03-2018T01:59:37,Twokinds,I've only ridden a horse once.
11-03-2018T01:59:49,TheBeckoner,I dont like horses...
11-03-2018T01:59:50,unsteddyphoenix,How'd it go?
11-03-2018T01:59:50,Vatruvius,woah....
11-03-2018T01:59:56,Twokinds,It was fine.

11-03-2018T02:00:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Riding a horse is ok to me too. I just really don’t like heights
11-03-2018T02:01:09,TheBeckoner,Theyre too big
11-03-2018T02:01:13,TheBeckoner,might squish me
11-03-2018T02:01:14,TheBeckoner,nop
11-03-2018T02:01:15,unsteddyphoenix,Could try a pony
11-03-2018T02:01:29,TheBeckoner,Those are mean...usually
11-03-2018T02:01:43,unsteddyphoenix,You right.
11-03-2018T02:01:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Did you ride with a saddle or bareback Tom
11-03-2018T02:01:47,Twokinds,"I have a healthy respect for heights, though no more than any average person, I imagine."
11-03-2018T02:01:52,Vatruvius,"With you on that one Kiwi. Ladders frighten me even though I know it is safe. I just hate the idea of falling off at all. Strangely, looking over an edge at Yosemite did not give me the same feeling, maybe it is because I am a nature guy."
11-03-2018T02:01:53,Twokinds,"Saddle, of course."
11-03-2018T02:01:55,TheBeckoner,My dad punched one in the nose cause it bit him on the shoulder once lol
11-03-2018T02:02:12,unsteddyphoenix,I used to be scared of heights then I...outgrew it?
11-03-2018T02:02:26,unsteddyphoenix,"I kind of outgrew all my fears, which is weird."
11-03-2018T02:02:34,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, all my irrational fears."
11-03-2018T02:02:49,TheBeckoner,Long enough exposure to heights sorta took that fear away
11-03-2018T02:02:52,Twokinds,"Yeah, same."
11-03-2018T02:02:59,Twokinds,I used to be pretty afraid of darkness.
11-03-2018T02:03:05,TheBeckoner,Me too
11-03-2018T02:03:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"If a latter has side rails, I’m pretty ok"
11-03-2018T02:03:17,Twokinds,Now I'm sitting in the dark right now because light hurts my eyes when I'm tired.
11-03-2018T02:03:20,TheBeckoner,Mainly of what could be in the dartk
11-03-2018T02:03:25,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
11-03-2018T02:03:35,unsteddyphoenix,I was afraid of needles. Hid in a cupboard in a hospital.
11-03-2018T02:03:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"The dark, Ive never really liked only because of what can be in it"
11-03-2018T02:03:41,unsteddyphoenix,Just to avoid one
11-03-2018T02:04:01,unsteddyphoenix,Had to get bribed out with a playstation. Which was pretty good~
11-03-2018T02:04:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Now it’s because I can’t see where I’m going and always seem to hit something
11-03-2018T02:04:13,unsteddyphoenix,YOu must become the night
11-03-2018T02:04:19,Twokinds,"Needles squicked me out a little, but I did give blood a lot when I was younger. So, obviously not that much."
11-03-2018T02:04:38,zolstarym,don't you still have to stare at a computer monitor?
11-03-2018T02:04:45,TheBeckoner,Im good with needles as long as I can see them go in.
11-03-2018T02:04:47,unsteddyphoenix,Thankfully giving blood was optional or I wouldve caused problems...
11-03-2018T02:04:49,Bgrmystr2,needles.. not a fan
11-03-2018T02:04:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Needles and me don’t get along
11-03-2018T02:05:04,Bgrmystr2,one too many times of being stuck by a nurse by a needle so big
11-03-2018T02:05:09,Bgrmystr2,and not getting any blood
11-03-2018T02:05:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Blood doesn’t bother me
11-03-2018T02:05:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Or gore
11-03-2018T02:05:28,TheBeckoner,Biggest needle I ever got was an IV for my wisdom teeth
11-03-2018T02:05:36,Vatruvius,"The dark was one of me strongest fears. Anything in my room seemed to be a shadow of a monster. I was plagued with nightmares for the longest time. Then, all of a sudden, it vanished. Like the game, get it? Please don't hit me."
11-03-2018T02:05:51,Bgrmystr2,You can only stab me 3 inches deep so many times looking for blood and not getting any before I tell ya to fek off &gt;:/
11-03-2018T02:05:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember that. Told me to count to ten - got to like 7
11-03-2018T02:06:02,unsteddyphoenix,I remember having a needle-drip in each arm. God that was a bad time.
11-03-2018T02:06:06,Bgrmystr2,bad nurses are bad
11-03-2018T02:06:30,TheBeckoner,Not sure if the nurse was bad but I had some scar tissue
11-03-2018T02:06:38,TheBeckoner,from the IV
11-03-2018T02:06:51,Vatruvius,"I am okay with small needles, it is when the needles is longer then 2 inches or starts to look like a coffee straw."
11-03-2018T02:06:58,Bgrmystr2,IV aren't really bad
11-03-2018T02:07:03,Bgrmystr2,they drip stuff into your body
11-03-2018T02:07:18,TheBeckoner,This one dripped in sleepy time chemicals
11-03-2018T02:07:22,Bgrmystr2,it's when they take blood out that's the not-fun one
11-03-2018T02:07:23,TheBeckoner,worked good
11-03-2018T02:07:29,Bgrmystr2,cuz they have to find a vessel
11-03-2018T02:07:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d be ok with giving blood if they did it without needles
11-03-2018T02:07:34,TheBeckoner,saw a bunch of colors before I passed out
11-03-2018T02:07:40,SpazztasticKiwi,But that’s not possible
11-03-2018T02:07:52,Bgrmystr2,lol how do you expect them to get the blood? xD
11-03-2018T02:08:03,Bgrmystr2,just.. open arm?
11-03-2018T02:08:06,Bgrmystr2,take blood

11-03-2018T02:11:15,unsteddyphoenix,Oh also I got stabbed by a ballpoint pen once
11-03-2018T02:11:21,unsteddyphoenix,So I needed an injection for that
11-03-2018T02:11:22,TheBeckoner,ow
11-03-2018T02:11:29,Vatruvius,I had blood tests done to find foods I am allergic to along with other health related stuff.
11-03-2018T02:11:29,Bgrmystr2,"why would you piss off a pen, phoenix?"
11-03-2018T02:11:36,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I know you respawn, but it still hurts"
11-03-2018T02:11:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I stabbed my self with a pencil once
11-03-2018T02:11:38,unsteddyphoenix,Sure learnt my lesson
11-03-2018T02:11:40,unsteddyphoenix,Niiiice!
11-03-2018T02:11:43,Bgrmystr2,"same, Kiwi"
11-03-2018T02:11:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Lead piece is still in my arm
11-03-2018T02:11:58,unsteddyphoenix,Wait BOTH of you did that?
11-03-2018T02:11:59,TheBeckoner,"lol I had a big ol 1/2"" drill skin my pinky finger once"
11-03-2018T02:12:03,Bgrmystr2,"it's actually graphite, probably"
11-03-2018T02:12:05,TheBeckoner,sucked bad
11-03-2018T02:12:18,Bgrmystr2,"if it were lead, kiwi, they would have taken it out"
11-03-2018T02:12:21,TheBeckoner,I also stabbed myself with a pencil...
11-03-2018T02:12:26,TheBeckoner,multipletimes
11-03-2018T02:12:30,Bgrmystr2,cuz lead is poisonous
11-03-2018T02:12:36,unsteddyphoenix,??????
11-03-2018T02:12:37,TheBeckoner,spacebarisntreal
11-03-2018T02:12:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I know but we still call it lead
11-03-2018T02:12:45,Vatruvius,No way...I stabbed myself with a pencil too in my hand. Had a little help with my sister to be honest. Lead is still there though it is a sliver. You can't feel anything solid.
11-03-2018T02:12:46,unsteddyphoenix,:question::grey_question::question::grey_question::grey_question:
11-03-2018T02:12:50,Bgrmystr2,don't call it lead XD
11-03-2018T02:12:51,unsteddyphoenix,What the fuck
11-03-2018T02:12:53,unsteddyphoenix,Guys
11-03-2018T02:13:00,TheBeckoner,You need to do it too
11-03-2018T02:13:01,Bgrmystr2,"I was in elementary, phoenix"
11-03-2018T02:13:05,TheBeckoner,same
11-03-2018T02:13:05,Bgrmystr2,and was stupid
11-03-2018T02:13:30,Bgrmystr2,"it went into and out my leg, basically"
11-03-2018T02:13:40,Bgrmystr2,still have the darkness too
11-03-2018T02:13:42,Vatruvius,"Yes, it is graphite, but more commonly known as lead."
11-03-2018T02:13:43,Bgrmystr2,it's still there
11-03-2018T02:13:48,unsteddyphoenix,.....
11-03-2018T02:13:51,Bgrmystr2,graphite isn't lead tho
11-03-2018T02:13:59,Bgrmystr2,cuz graphite isn't harmful
11-03-2018T02:14:02,Bgrmystr2,:(
11-03-2018T02:14:02,SpazztasticKiwi,They drew blood to check if I was allergic to cats and dogs and when they checked my iron levels for anemia
11-03-2018T02:14:13,Bgrmystr2,ya can't just.. you know.. put them together
11-03-2018T02:14:15,Bgrmystr2,that's bad
11-03-2018T02:14:16,Vatruvius,"In this case, it is called lead but does not mean the elemental lead."
11-03-2018T02:15:32,Twokinds,I'm headed to sleep.
11-03-2018T02:15:40,Bgrmystr2,originally it was though vatru
11-03-2018T02:15:42,SpazztasticKiwi,For the life of me I couldn’t figure out how drawing blood helped decide if I was allergic to cats. Did they hold a hair to the sample and watched if the blood cells sneezed?
11-03-2018T02:15:43,Bgrmystr2,gnight Tom
11-03-2018T02:15:44,TheBeckoner,Goodnight Tom
11-03-2018T02:15:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Night Tom
11-03-2018T02:15:50,unsteddyphoenix,Gnight Tom.
11-03-2018T02:15:58,unsteddyphoenix,You never stabbed yourself with a pencil right?
11-03-2018T02:16:06,SpazztasticKiwi,But no. They look at the antibodies
11-03-2018T02:17:02,unsteddyphoenix,Damn he didnt answer
11-03-2018T02:17:07,Vatruvius,Goodnight Tom
11-03-2018T02:17:07,Twokinds,"I'm an artist. I carried lots of pencils in my pockets, sometimes point-side up. So, yes, I have."
11-03-2018T02:17:13,Bgrmystr2,AH HA
11-03-2018T02:17:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I seem to recal Mark admitting he popped him in the face with a thigh blaster thing
11-03-2018T02:17:16,unsteddyphoenix,God...god damnit.
11-03-2018T02:17:17,TheBeckoner,huehue
11-03-2018T02:17:20,Bgrmystr2,"Phoenix, what have you been DOING"
11-03-2018T02:17:28,TheBeckoner,Nothing apparently.
11-03-2018T02:17:30,Vatruvius,What was that @Bgrmyster2 Through me?
11-03-2018T02:17:34,Bgrmystr2,Everybody who's anybody has stabbed themself with a pencil
11-03-2018T02:17:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"OW, by the way"
11-03-2018T02:17:43,TheBeckoner,wot
11-03-2018T02:18:07,unsteddyphoenix,Siiiigh....
11-03-2018T02:18:11,unsteddyphoenix,Brb getting a pencil...
11-03-2018T02:18:15,Vatruvius,"Yeah, they test allergies by seeing the immune response in the blood sample they too to whatever allergy they are testing."
11-03-2018T02:18:25,Vatruvius,lol
11-03-2018T02:18:35,TheBeckoner,oneofusoneofus
11-03-2018T02:18:36,Vatruvius,took*
11-03-2018T02:18:43,Bgrmystr2,and I didn't @ anyone Vatru lol
11-03-2018T02:18:50,SpazztasticKiwi,They said I’m allergic but here I am with four dogs and four cats and I’m ok
11-03-2018T02:18:54,Bgrmystr2,so I dunno what you mean :ptv-wondering:
11-03-2018T02:19:30,TheBeckoner,I'm allergic to the cats
11-03-2018T02:19:37,TheBeckoner,get all puffy and red
11-03-2018T02:19:47,TheBeckoner,worth it every time tho
11-03-2018T02:20:09,Vatruvius,"You chatted ""originally it was though vatru"" just a little while ago @Bgrmystr2. Not sure what about though?"
11-03-2018T02:20:22,Twokinds,I'm alergic to cats.
11-03-2018T02:20:29,SpazztasticKiwi,We know
11-03-2018T02:20:33,Vatruvius,Right before Kiwi's latest paragraph.
11-03-2018T02:20:44,Twokinds,Waiting for my cat to go to to great beyond one day so I can be freeeeee
11-03-2018T02:20:58,Vatruvius,"Hey, now they serve as landmarks to find messages Kiwi."
11-03-2018T02:21:02,Bgrmystr2,"oh, originally was lead, but now graphite"
11-03-2018T02:21:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Why not rehome her
11-03-2018T02:21:06,TheBeckoner,Tom is prisoner to cats
11-03-2018T02:21:10,Twokinds,nooo
11-03-2018T02:21:11,TheBeckoner,Flora is all powerful
11-03-2018T02:21:13,Twokinds,I can't do that.
11-03-2018T02:21:19,Vatruvius,ohh...okay
11-03-2018T02:21:33,SpazztasticKiwi,She wouldn’t adjust?
11-03-2018T02:21:42,Vatruvius,"Okay Tom, does your cat look like anyone in the comic?"
11-03-2018T02:21:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Or your mother would freak
11-03-2018T02:21:42,TheBeckoner,Nah man thats just sad to do
11-03-2018T02:21:51,Twokinds,Holly needs me.
11-03-2018T02:22:00,Bgrmystr2,It's.. a cat tom.
11-03-2018T02:22:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Aww
11-03-2018T02:22:03,Twokinds,She's completely dependant. I wouldn't do that to her.
11-03-2018T02:22:10,SpazztasticKiwi,My heart
11-03-2018T02:22:12,Bgrmystr2,It'll need anyone.
11-03-2018T02:22:22,Bgrmystr2,they're like.. almost all like that
11-03-2018T02:22:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"No, some cats are one-person only"
11-03-2018T02:22:32,unsteddyphoenix,But youre waiting for her to...
11-03-2018T02:22:33,Vatruvius,Tom Cares 2018
11-03-2018T02:22:34,unsteddyphoenix,hm
11-03-2018T02:22:37,unsteddyphoenix,complicated relationship
11-03-2018T02:22:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"Vat, comment of the month"
11-03-2018T02:23:05,Bgrmystr2,I dunno about the month
11-03-2018T02:23:06,Vatruvius,Woohoo! Got one.
11-03-2018T02:23:07,Bgrmystr2,maybe the day.
11-03-2018T02:23:24,Bgrmystr2,We're  only the 12th
11-03-2018T02:23:40,Bgrmystr2,"just started a new week, and have half a month left"
11-03-2018T02:23:42,Bgrmystr2,xD
11-03-2018T02:23:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I know Kiwi is a one person cat. And Bagheera generally only listens to me
11-03-2018T02:23:54,TheBeckoner,we start the next month now.
11-03-2018T02:24:01,TheBeckoner,happynextmonth
11-03-2018T02:24:08,Bgrmystr2,"you need to meet people that are animal people, Kiwi"
11-03-2018T02:24:12,Vatruvius,"So, did anyone else think Legolas Keith when Tom sketched Keith jumping off the bridge?"
11-03-2018T02:24:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I seem to have found a few here
11-03-2018T02:24:28,TheBeckoner,Brain tired
11-03-2018T02:24:52,Twokinds,Bed heated. Time for bed
11-03-2018T02:24:58,Vatruvius,"Total animal person here, not a fan of cats but I don't hate them. Just wouldn't own one."
11-03-2018T02:24:59,Bgrmystr2,"animals are sometimes hostile at first, but it's not like they're one-person only. They just have different standards of what they consider friendly behavior in humans"
11-03-2018T02:25:11,Bgrmystr2,Have a good night tom :)
11-03-2018T02:25:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Night (again)
11-03-2018T02:25:23,Vatruvius,Goodnight Tom
11-03-2018T02:25:27,unsteddyphoenix,"nice, gnight~"
11-03-2018T02:25:32,TheBeckoner,glhf dont burn house to ground
11-03-2018T02:25:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m sure he’s got fire alarms
11-03-2018T02:26:08,Vatruvius,Hmm...what if this current color of Flora sleeping was a bed sheet/comforter?
11-03-2018T02:26:33,Vatruvius,Totally kid friendly.
11-03-2018T02:26:46,TheBeckoner,I took those weird things down...kept beeping at stuff...
11-03-2018T02:26:53,Vatruvius,TwoKinds: The Movie
11-03-2018T02:27:17,SpazztasticKiwi,“I’m just cooking - shut up”
11-03-2018T02:28:32,Vatruvius,lol
11-03-2018T02:28:44,Vatruvius,If I had a quarter for every time that was the case.
11-03-2018T02:29:20,SpazztasticKiwi,You’d have enough for cooking lessons?
11-03-2018T02:29:41,TheBeckoner,ha
11-03-2018T02:30:08,TheBeckoner,If left to my own devices I may well consume raw ingredients
11-03-2018T02:30:17,TheBeckoner,and never cook a thing
11-03-2018T02:30:22,Vatruvius,I do not burn my food. When I make pies they come out perfect but they are also really juicy so some of that juice spills over no matter what. That stuff burns better then a dry Christmas tree.
11-03-2018T02:30:40,TheBeckoner,happlychrysler
11-03-2018T02:31:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t really cook unless it’s for a group
11-03-2018T02:31:42,TheBeckoner,If i have people its gl to them to find their own food.
11-03-2018T02:32:27,SpazztasticKiwi,“Forage. I ain’t your mother”

11-03-2018T16:43:21,MetalAppleSauce,"or a second panel of her flipping keith's hair out of his face, only to reveal that it's just alaric's body"
11-03-2018T16:43:32,Whitestripes,Its... Just really good special effects... Yeah
11-03-2018T16:43:36,CheeseRS,"Or better, Alabaster's"

11-03-2018T16:43:57,Bgrmystr2,Are there any more polls? Or did I miss em?
11-03-2018T16:44:04,Vatruvius,With you on that one @Whitestripes...please... ...please be good special effects...

11-03-2018T16:45:03,InTheLionsDen,There has been one poll today.
11-03-2018T16:45:04,Vatruvius,This is just a continuation from last stream...so...
11-03-2018T16:45:10,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah there was one poll, we missed it~"
11-03-2018T16:45:14,Vatruvius,"Oh, alright. So this is a Tom pick."
11-03-2018T16:45:17,Dadrobit,Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh! That's the outfits they were wearing at the Basitin Isles! I think this is an AU version where Alaric just won.
11-03-2018T16:45:23,CheeseRS,"If anyone watches Supernatural, I am crying so hard like the moment when Bobby died on the hospital bed"
11-03-2018T16:45:34,Grishmark,Hi all

11-03-2018T16:47:53,CheeseRS,This is the last image that I want to get inked
11-03-2018T16:47:55,Shortii,Returned~.

11-03-2018T16:48:47,TerraTheWizard,o he ded
11-03-2018T16:48:50,CheeseRS,Yep.
11-03-2018T16:48:51,Wolfe415,Oh
11-03-2018T16:48:53,Dadrobit,Speculation: Alaric winning the battle on the bridge AU
11-03-2018T16:48:58,Vatruvius,^
11-03-2018T16:49:03,CheeseRS,HE DEAD I TELL YOU THAT
11-03-2018T16:49:10,Whitestripes,A moment of silence for dear keith
11-03-2018T16:49:15,TerraTheWizard,it's totally not raspberry jam
11-03-2018T16:49:16,MetalAppleSauce,I tell you what
11-03-2018T16:49:22,InTheLionsDen,He's dead Jim.
11-03-2018T16:49:23,Vatruvius,"Okay, this happy music does not fit anymore."
11-03-2018T16:49:31,unsteddyphoenix,Man how would Alaric feel winning.
11-03-2018T16:49:34,MetalAppleSauce,there's totally not a ketchup bottle underneath the cape somewhere
11-03-2018T16:49:36,CheeseRS,And my steam lagged when you said that @Whitestripes
11-03-2018T16:49:41,unsteddyphoenix,"Probably worse than if he had lost, honestly."
11-03-2018T16:49:47,CheeseRS,Stream*
11-03-2018T16:49:48,Dadrobit,More than he feels now tbh
11-03-2018T16:49:50,Shortii,"""Oh crud, I killed my childhood friend."""
11-03-2018T16:49:58,CheeseRS,Lmao
11-03-2018T16:50:34,CheeseRS,"Dang it Keith, how did you slip on ketchup bottle?"
11-03-2018T16:50:43,Vatruvius,"I do not think Alaric would actually let Keith lose. By the work he did to make Keith ambassador, he leaped hoping it would kill him."
11-03-2018T16:50:55,InTheLionsDen,"Keith: Blood, blood, blood and... death. Natani: Okay, now you're milking it."
11-03-2018T16:51:03,CheeseRS,True words
11-03-2018T16:51:09,GameForge,@inthelionsden
11-03-2018T16:51:10,Shortii,"""Tell my almost wife to wait for me. I'm on my way."""

11-03-2018T16:51:22,Dadrobit,That's some incredible wishful thinking you got there vat
11-03-2018T16:51:42,GameForge,these are soom good quotes
11-03-2018T16:51:42,Yosshq,xD
11-03-2018T16:51:49,Whitestripes,"Nah, he's dead this time. For reals"
11-03-2018T16:51:51,BadFoMo,Keith: I regret nothing. I lived as few men dear to dream. HERK! Bleaa. Natani: Keith... Keith... What's my line? Red: CUT!
11-03-2018T16:51:52,MetalAppleSauce,"I'm pretty sure Alaric likely intended to lose, but he didn't intend to die"
11-03-2018T16:51:57,CheeseRS,Oh please tell me Keith has some potatoes tucked in there and they uncover it and it spills potato juice
11-03-2018T16:51:59,unsteddyphoenix,It was probably difficult for him to fight his waifu. Some internal conflict there.
11-03-2018T16:52:02,Yosshq,My comment - 'xD'
11-03-2018T16:52:19,BadFoMo,*dare

11-03-2018T16:52:37,Dadrobit,"I don't think he wanted to kill Keith, but there's not a chance he had any intention of losing."
11-03-2018T16:52:40,MetalAppleSauce,No
11-03-2018T16:52:49,Yosshq,No mods (noulikethis)
11-03-2018T16:52:51,CheeseRS,Now this is POSITIVE MENTAL ATTITUDE

11-03-2018T16:53:58,Vatruvius,"I get what you mean @CheeseRS, it would have to be a bag of nuts or something."
11-03-2018T16:54:19,MetalAppleSauce,"Natani *definitely* won't try to bring Keith to life, and end up shattering her mind further to the point of insanity, and eventually forcing her way to Grand Templar"
11-03-2018T16:54:19,CheeseRS,"Yep, a big bag of almond milk, better named as nut juice"
11-03-2018T16:54:20,Tokagedraws,OH NO

11-03-2018T16:55:33,CheeseRS,"Heh, you'd wish"
11-03-2018T16:55:45,Vatruvius,It is at that moment that Alabaster started to hurt Flora and Trace woke up to see Natani holding Keith like this...No more Basitin Islands.
11-03-2018T16:56:04,Yosshq,Darn... guys
11-03-2018T16:56:09,BadFoMo,@Dadrobit Natani: You're not fooling anyone.
11-03-2018T16:56:22,CheeseRS,We all are stupid. This is just a redux of the moment Natani went to Keith and he is still alive. Barely
11-03-2018T16:56:30,CheeseRS,Right?
11-03-2018T16:56:35,Dadrobit,Not with a sword in him like that
11-03-2018T16:56:40,Vatruvius,he was never stabbed @CheeseRS
11-03-2018T16:56:47,MetalAppleSauce,"""Keith, this is BLUEBERRY jam, what the fuck."""
11-03-2018T16:56:57,CheeseRS,It had to be too good to be true...

11-03-2018T16:57:04,Shortii,"Yeah, redux, right."
11-03-2018T16:57:07,Shortii,I knew that.
11-03-2018T16:57:10,DarthKeidran,I guess Keith is blue blooded?
11-03-2018T16:57:11,Terramaster20209,how are you guys feeling ?
11-03-2018T16:57:12,Dadrobit,Get the tweesers

11-03-2018T16:57:14,Twokinds,Glad I picked the game soundtracks for this stream
11-03-2018T16:57:20,Twokinds,Probably not a good time for a bounce
11-03-2018T16:57:23,CheeseRS,Yeah
11-03-2018T16:57:24,Shortii,"Yeah, awesome choice."
11-03-2018T16:57:30,CheeseRS,We need bounce

11-03-2018T16:58:19,MviluUatusun,"On the next page, we see Natani face screwed up in rage and bloodlust in her eyes."
11-03-2018T16:58:22,Shortii,Noooo~ Don't redux every page. Keeping the older artstyle as well as his newer one adds charm to the comic. ^^
11-03-2018T16:58:23,GameForge,still want the natani and bandages one...
11-03-2018T16:58:24,Vatruvius,This one needs to get colored.
11-03-2018T16:58:35,Bgrmystr2,"well.. it is sort of colored, Vatru"
11-03-2018T16:58:35,DarthKeidran,I don’t think Keith would like that cardboard sword bouncing in his armpit. That would chafe quickly.
11-03-2018T16:58:37,Bgrmystr2,on the comic page :V
11-03-2018T16:58:40,thestooge,Game soundtracks actually help with work

11-03-2018T20:47:47,TorqueEmUp,XD
11-03-2018T20:48:15,unsteddyphoenix,Which in turn inspired all future genderbends?
11-03-2018T20:48:21,Twokinds,Pretty much
11-03-2018T20:48:49,unsteddyphoenix,What a snowball effect.
11-03-2018T20:48:52,TorqueEmUp,I think genderbends would have eventually happened anyway. :P
11-03-2018T20:49:13,TorqueEmUp,"maybe not in the comic, but definitely in sketches."
11-03-2018T20:49:54,unsteddyphoenix,I dont know~ without preface would it happen?
11-03-2018T20:50:05,unsteddyphoenix,See: all the sketch ideas that are copies of each other
11-03-2018T20:50:06,Bgrmystr2,So that really was the guy? :ptv-wondering:
11-03-2018T20:50:26,unsteddyphoenix,"LOL ""Oh, I wanna play too! Eric is based off of me. It all happened after I scraped my knee and told Tom, he was very accommodating - I've been in almost every comic since. """
11-03-2018T20:50:36,Bgrmystr2,ikr
11-03-2018T20:50:39,unsteddyphoenix,Crrar was NOT having any of it :ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
11-03-2018T20:51:00,Bgrmystr2,haha yeah
11-03-2018T20:51:11,Dadrobit,Did I miss something w/ Crar?
11-03-2018T20:51:20,Dadrobit,CRrar*
11-03-2018T20:51:21,Bgrmystr2,missed reading the thread apparently
11-03-2018T20:51:43,Dadrobit,On the forums?
11-03-2018T20:51:47,Bgrmystr2,ya
11-03-2018T20:51:49,unsteddyphoenix,Was just looking through the thread. Crrar sassed him up lol
11-03-2018T20:51:51,TorqueEmUp,Nah I've seen plenty of gender bends in fandoms with no basis to WHY they start. People just like genderbending.
11-03-2018T20:52:14,Dadrobit,"ohhhh, in the maybe Mike thread"
11-03-2018T20:52:23,unsteddyphoenix,mhm
11-03-2018T20:52:40,Bgrmystr2,yeah
11-03-2018T20:52:43,Dadrobit,I thought you were saying he was going off on people making the same sketch requests over and over again
11-03-2018T20:52:52,Bgrmystr2,eh? xD
11-03-2018T20:53:09,unsteddyphoenix,Man this was from 2015? Its been longer than I thought since ive been on the forums
11-03-2018T20:53:13,Dadrobit,"Like all the line ups, or Keith and Natani do a thing."
11-03-2018T20:53:41,Dadrobit,Have you been on since I sent you my Adelaide/Zen slash fic?
11-03-2018T20:54:00,unsteddyphoenix,Dont think so
11-03-2018T20:54:03,unsteddyphoenix,Hey you can quote people now
11-03-2018T20:54:04,unsteddyphoenix,neat
11-03-2018T20:54:21,Dadrobit,Hm?
11-03-2018T20:54:29,TorqueEmUp,on the forum he means
11-03-2018T20:54:34,Dadrobit,You could always quote people
11-03-2018T20:54:54,unsteddyphoenix,But like. I got tagged in it.
11-03-2018T20:55:03,Dadrobit,yeah?
11-03-2018T20:55:14,unsteddyphoenix,Thats new!
11-03-2018T20:56:07,Dadrobit,I don't think so? The only new feature that I'm aware of is that direct quotes allow for linking to the post that was quoted.
11-03-2018T20:57:21,Dadrobit,Maybe some update changed your defaults and you just had it turned off before.
11-03-2018T20:58:30,unsteddyphoenix,I will accept this explanation
11-03-2018T20:58:35,unsteddyphoenix,this time
11-03-2018T20:59:26,Dadrobit,I'll be more careful in correcting you in the future.
11-03-2018T21:00:38,unsteddyphoenix,See that you are. :ctwokinds-kingtea:
11-03-2018T21:01:00,Bgrmystr2,xD this exchange
11-03-2018T21:01:48,Dadrobit,The only exchange rate I accept deals in love and passion.
11-03-2018T21:02:16,Dadrobit,Cuz I'm motherfucking romantic.
11-03-2018T21:02:42,unsteddyphoenix,"I happen to have some of that spare, perhaps a transaction can be arranged~ :ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:"
11-03-2018T21:03:34,Dadrobit,Only if we work through bonds.
11-03-2018T21:04:08,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao
11-03-2018T21:04:12,unsteddyphoenix,Pay in installments
11-03-2018T21:06:17,Dadrobit,There will definitely be compunding interest here.
11-03-2018T21:07:29,unsteddyphoenix,Oh shit I forgot about the forum writing competition
11-03-2018T21:08:10,unsteddyphoenix,Its such a good excuse to practice.
11-03-2018T21:08:19,Dadrobit,Did you sumit something? I didn't even read anything this year I don't think...
11-03-2018T21:08:24,Dadrobit,submit*
11-03-2018T21:08:52,unsteddyphoenix,"Nah, I used to do it though. Way back when."
11-03-2018T21:09:25,Dadrobit,"Mmmm, need to do it more myself."
11-03-2018T21:09:34,unsteddyphoenix,"I remember there was this girl who was like, way better than everyone else lol."
11-03-2018T21:09:49,Dadrobit,Which year?
11-03-2018T21:09:59,Dadrobit,(s)
11-03-2018T21:10:23,unsteddyphoenix,Pre-2015? Doesnt look like she entered last time either
11-03-2018T21:10:32,Dadrobit,"I remember there were a few good ones in 15 and 16, but I'll be damned if I can recall who they were."
11-03-2018T21:13:27,unsteddyphoenix,Im just browsing now
11-03-2018T21:14:09,unsteddyphoenix,Hm. How DOES the keidran language work? Is it based off something?
11-03-2018T21:14:28,Dadrobit,"IIRC, there are two variations. Hih and Low Keidran"
11-03-2018T21:15:16,unsteddyphoenix,Ho~
11-03-2018T21:15:17,Dadrobit,Low Keidran is spoken by Natani and generally just sounds like a lot of growlin which is how the gender is concealed as there are no feminine inflections.
11-03-2018T21:15:24,Dadrobit,growling
11-03-2018T21:15:49,Dadrobit,"High Keidran is spoken by Flora, but I don't think Tom ever specified what it exactly sounds like."
11-03-2018T21:16:50,unsteddyphoenix,Could a human learn low keidran or do they not have the capability :thinking:
11-03-2018T21:17:50,Dadrobit,"Nevermind, he covers both, found the post"
11-03-2018T21:17:51,Dadrobit,http://twokindscomic.com/ArchiveForum/viewtopic.php?t=6430&start=7
11-03-2018T21:18:25,unsteddyphoenix,Dad I want you to know that I appreciate you.
11-03-2018T21:18:26,Dadrobit,"Ah, and Flora only knows some High Keidran"
11-03-2018T21:18:46,Dadrobit,"No problem, I have all this stuff bookmarked for safe keeping :)"
11-03-2018T21:18:56,unsteddyphoenix,I wonder if Floras bully spoke high keidran
11-03-2018T21:19:38,unsteddyphoenix,"Wait so Flora sounds like a man too, then"
11-03-2018T21:19:54,Dadrobit,"Most likely, still doesn't excuse the ""accent"" though"
11-03-2018T21:22:05,unsteddyphoenix,"Keith speaks both wow, he really is the perfect diplomat."
11-03-2018T21:22:07,Bgrmystr2,hold up
11-03-2018T21:22:22,Bgrmystr2,"So the old templar, before Trace, were the ones who attacked flora's tribe"
11-03-2018T21:22:35,Dadrobit,Never specified.
11-03-2018T21:22:35,Bgrmystr2,cuz they were encroaching human territory
11-03-2018T21:22:49,Dadrobit,"Ah, well in the comic"
11-03-2018T21:22:53,Bgrmystr2,tom literally says it in the link you posted
11-03-2018T21:22:55,Bgrmystr2,xD
11-03-2018T21:23:00,Dadrobit,"Yeah, but it's pre 2008"
11-03-2018T21:23:05,unsteddyphoenix,Conjecture!
11-03-2018T21:23:11,Bgrmystr2,still
11-03-2018T21:23:24,Dadrobit,all that stuff is no longer canon with specific exceptions
11-03-2018T21:23:38,Bgrmystr2,"if that were true, that would mean it was Raine's mother as the leader of the templar back then?"
11-03-2018T21:24:23,Dadrobit,"The language is confirmed, the masks position in the story is mostly still true, but stuff like plot is all to be taken with a spoonful of salt"
11-03-2018T21:24:32,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I dunno. There's nothing that really disproves it"
11-03-2018T21:24:36,Dadrobit,Tom was writing from the seat of his pants back then.
11-03-2018T21:24:41,Bgrmystr2,lolo
11-03-2018T21:25:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I have gummy bears and I’m entirely too happy over that
11-03-2018T21:25:32,unsteddyphoenix,Grats~
11-03-2018T21:27:45,unsteddyphoenix,Did the templar even have any quarrel with the wolves pre-trace though?
11-03-2018T21:27:51,SpazztasticKiwi,And I almost hit a dog on the way home
11-03-2018T21:27:53,Dadrobit,"I mean, there's still stuff in 2008 talking about how Flora spent most of her life as a slave in the company of a rich dragonrider named Vincent Galhand."
11-03-2018T21:27:55,unsteddyphoenix,*tigers
11-03-2018T21:28:04,unsteddyphoenix,THey did have problems with the wolves
11-03-2018T21:28:18,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha
11-03-2018T21:28:24,unsteddyphoenix,Awesome~
11-03-2018T21:29:23,Dadrobit,And that the basitins were wiped out just 6 months prior to the story.
11-03-2018T21:30:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder if Tom has any idea on how Flora and Trace’s baby’s gonna look like
11-03-2018T21:30:01,unsteddyphoenix,I did know that one
11-03-2018T21:30:14,unsteddyphoenix,Instead it's going to be Lyn'knoll that's wiped out /s
11-03-2018T21:30:41,unsteddyphoenix,https://twokinds.deviantart.com/art/Sketchithon-07-Halfbreed-355248611
11-03-2018T21:30:42,Dadrobit,Not entirely impossible.
11-03-2018T21:30:44,unsteddyphoenix,Rory is canon believe
11-03-2018T21:30:56,Dadrobit,Was about to look for that
11-03-2018T21:31:38,Dadrobit,"And if the Edinmere crisis doesn't turn Trace's ideals towards helping fix what he started, then I actually do hope they find that place in ashes."
11-03-2018T21:31:54,Dadrobit,Dude's just been running the whole story.
11-03-2018T21:34:13,unsteddyphoenix,Mm. As it is now the story is set to end at Lyn'knoll. A twist'll surely happen.
11-03-2018T21:34:18,TorqueEmUp,That Dadro I believe would be far more preferable to me than just a human with a cat ears and a tail.
11-03-2018T21:34:42,unsteddyphoenix,Unless all the loose ends are wrapped up by all the conspirators running arounfd in the background
11-03-2018T21:35:14,TorqueEmUp,*Isn't a fan of nekomimi
11-03-2018T21:35:16,unsteddyphoenix,"That could be interesting. Cute comfy stuff in the foreground, glimpses of plot in the background."
11-03-2018T21:35:48,Dadrobit,Is that one of them chinese cartoon terms?
11-03-2018T21:36:04,unsteddyphoenix,Theyre called mangos
11-03-2018T21:36:06,unsteddyphoenix,And I think so
11-03-2018T21:36:22,Dadrobit,Ahhh
11-03-2018T21:36:55,Bgrmystr2,xDD
11-03-2018T21:37:31,unsteddyphoenix,"I like Rorys design, s'more than a nekomeme. I would guess the babby will probably be similar to that."
11-03-2018T21:37:45,Bgrmystr2,"I don't think anything happened to Lyn'knoll though, considering Nora is one that flew there. If something happened, she wouldn't have recommended to go there"
11-03-2018T21:38:02,Dadrobit,It's been a couple months
11-03-2018T21:38:08,unsteddyphoenix,And it could still happen
11-03-2018T21:38:12,unsteddyphoenix,Or is happening right now
11-03-2018T21:38:15,Bgrmystr2,maybe
11-03-2018T21:38:37,Bgrmystr2,perhaps it's not that it's happening.. but that theyr'e expecting trace to lead them right to it? :ptv-wondering:
11-03-2018T21:38:42,Dadrobit,Trace might unwittingly have a kill switch he doesn't know about that activates and lets Dark Trace come out when he finds the place.
11-03-2018T21:39:03,Dadrobit,Like he turned himself into his own sleeper agent
11-03-2018T21:39:26,Dadrobit,Death Note style
11-03-2018T21:39:46,Dadrobit,(Speaking of Mangos)
11-03-2018T21:39:48,unsteddyphoenix,Thatd be siiick~
11-03-2018T21:39:48,Bgrmystr2,"If the templar don't know where it is and trace is on his way there, they can just follow him. And evil trace or not, that'd still be bad to begin with"
11-03-2018T21:40:12,unsteddyphoenix,If Trace works his way full circle to become the villian of the story im all for it.
11-03-2018T21:40:13,Bgrmystr2,but yeah trace is obviously gonna have some kind of clash with his past self again
11-03-2018T21:40:28,Dadrobit,I'd be in total support of a bad end
11-03-2018T21:40:32,Bgrmystr2,boo
11-03-2018T21:40:33,Bgrmystr2,do not want
11-03-2018T21:40:50,Dadrobit,Go read Housepets
11-03-2018T21:41:03,unsteddyphoenix,"Then, the sequel; The bab grows up and overthrows Trace"
11-03-2018T21:41:13,Bgrmystr2,"I don't even know what that is, dadro lol"
11-03-2018T21:41:26,Dadrobit,"Soooooo, Star Wars?"
11-03-2018T21:41:40,Dadrobit,Is the kid gonna be trained by Keith?
11-03-2018T21:41:42,Bgrmystr2,lol phoenix
11-03-2018T21:41:42,unsteddyphoenix,Oh yeah...
11-03-2018T21:41:55,unsteddyphoenix,"Sure, absolutely."
11-03-2018T21:41:59,unsteddyphoenix,Im all in.
11-03-2018T21:42:01,Bgrmystr2,haha
11-03-2018T21:42:09,Bgrmystr2,"that'd be funny actually, but"
11-03-2018T21:42:16,Bgrmystr2,Still rather prefer not a bad end :u
11-03-2018T21:43:06,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, tbh while I dont hate bad ends..."
11-03-2018T21:43:20,unsteddyphoenix,This comic too comfy~
11-03-2018T21:43:49,Dadrobit,"Yep, I've gotten some heat over that conversation a few times now..."
11-03-2018T21:44:00,unsteddyphoenix,Plus if Kat dies im not sure i'd recover :ctwokinds-reniderp:
11-03-2018T21:44:02,Bgrmystr2,"I'm not against bad endings now and then, but TK's all about seeing past that and moving forward to a better future"
11-03-2018T21:44:16,unsteddyphoenix,Ooo you got in trouble~?
11-03-2018T21:44:37,Dadrobit,"I'm literally cancer, unsteddy."
11-03-2018T21:44:43,Dadrobit,Worse than Leo
11-03-2018T21:44:47,Bgrmystr2,wat
11-03-2018T21:44:48,unsteddyphoenix,So I hear~
11-03-2018T21:45:35,Dadrobit,"Lol, Bgr, I know a few people in the fandom that hold very little love for me."
11-03-2018T21:46:29,Bgrmystr2,you're not even remotely one of the people I'd expect many to have no love for
11-03-2018T21:46:40,unsteddyphoenix,I was surprised too
11-03-2018T21:46:48,Dadrobit,Shoulda' screened that 4chan thread...
11-03-2018T21:47:16,Bgrmystr2,Though I guess the people I'm thinking about do actually probably have more ppl that hate them than you do
11-03-2018T21:48:25,Dadrobit,"Boy-o lemme tell ya, they certainly let me know it back when I was making a run for my Keith/Maddie later years suggestion."
11-03-2018T21:50:20,unsteddyphoenix,You monster~
11-03-2018T21:51:02,Bgrmystr2,lolo
11-03-2018T21:51:32,Dadrobit,I literally deserve to be castrated.
11-03-2018T21:51:49,Dadrobit,My autism must not breed.
11-03-2018T21:52:02,unsteddyphoenix,"Agreed, tbh."
11-03-2018T21:52:23,unsteddyphoenix,Though your voice is so potent it may not work
11-03-2018T21:53:09,Dadrobit,"Hey, it's gotten me dates before"
11-03-2018T21:53:24,Dadrobit,"Granted, it also lost me a girlfriend...."
11-03-2018T21:53:35,unsteddyphoenix,Thats more on you I think
11-03-2018T21:54:01,Dadrobit,"Clearly the haters were right, get the rusty hatchet."
11-03-2018T21:54:23,unsteddyphoenix,Man...once group b goes through that portal theres gonna be like...15s character all at the mansion.
11-03-2018T21:55:35,Dadrobit,18
11-03-2018T21:55:51,Dadrobit,19 forgot Rose
11-03-2018T21:56:36,unsteddyphoenix,Something...has to happen about that. That's a mess.
11-03-2018T21:56:43,unsteddyphoenix,Surely.
11-03-2018T21:57:22,Dadrobit,Close ups on the faces of the people who are talking at the moment. Zero wide angle shots
11-03-2018T21:57:47,unsteddyphoenix,Ooof.
11-03-2018T21:58:28,Dadrobit,"Granted, Evals, Eric, and Mike might be leaving fairly permanantly here pretty soon."
11-03-2018T21:59:09,Dadrobit,They really don't serve much of a purpose anymore.
11-03-2018T21:59:39,unsteddyphoenix,Agreeed
11-03-2018T21:59:52,unsteddyphoenix,But they cant be the only ones
11-03-2018T21:59:58,Dadrobit,"What makes it wakward is Tom making Maren, Karen, and Red pseudo main characters."
11-03-2018T22:00:25,Dadrobit,They really are just distant friends from a time past.
11-03-2018T22:00:34,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, 'cause now they have unresolved stories"
11-03-2018T22:01:03,Dadrobit,Best case scenario is to leave at least Maren and Karen in Edinmere to start a new life.
11-03-2018T22:01:04,unsteddyphoenix,And yet the only important one from that group really is Raine
11-03-2018T22:01:29,unsteddyphoenix,Sythe is still a traitor
11-03-2018T22:01:37,Dadrobit,Red and Sythe are only around as potential suitors for Raine.
11-03-2018T22:01:46,Dadrobit,And Sythe was in with Flora
11-03-2018T22:02:14,unsteddyphoenix,Uhh you forgot Maren X Raine
11-03-2018T22:02:42,unsteddyphoenix,Sythe has nowhere to go now...unless he hides in the mansion with Rose
11-03-2018T22:02:43,Dadrobit,"No I didn't, because the only acceptable ship is Zen X Raine."
11-03-2018T22:03:25,unsteddyphoenix,EricXRaine lewd ship best ship

11-03-2018T22:05:27,unsteddyphoenix,"I kind of get the feeling the mansions going to get attacked, and theyre all going to get separated again."
11-03-2018T22:06:02,Bgrmystr2,You do remember that team B is headed for lyn'knoll right?
11-03-2018T22:06:25,Bgrmystr2,and it's likely that kat would leave with eric if eric leaves somewhere
11-03-2018T22:07:33,unsteddyphoenix,"I do, but 15-odd characters all travelling together seems unlikely to me"
11-03-2018T22:08:25,Bgrmystr2,The only people we know of that have intentions of going to Lyn'knoll are Team B (bar sythe) and flora/trace.
11-03-2018T22:08:45,unsteddyphoenix,"Also unsure if Kat would leave with Eric, some ground has been layed for her to leave. Not necessarily to Lynknoll but."
11-03-2018T22:08:52,Bgrmystr2,well yeah but
11-03-2018T22:08:59,Bgrmystr2,she likes him

11-03-2018T22:09:35,Bgrmystr2,"well yeah, Keith is going to spread Laura's ashes in her hometown, right?"
11-03-2018T22:09:39,Bgrmystr2,that's a long journey
11-03-2018T22:09:48,Bgrmystr2,so he won't be staying at lyn'knoll
11-03-2018T22:09:52,Bgrmystr2,like Team B
11-03-2018T22:09:57,Bgrmystr2,"he might go back, but"
11-03-2018T22:10:13,Bgrmystr2,he still has more ahead of him
11-03-2018T22:10:29,unsteddyphoenix,Hm. Maybe the theyr'll just be two groups again with shuffled characters
11-03-2018T22:10:37,CrRAR,"If war is breaking out in lots of places might not be safe to go though, right?"
11-03-2018T22:10:43,Bgrmystr2,and isn't Raine heading to Lyn'knoll as a part of team B anyway?
11-03-2018T22:11:01,Bgrmystr2,"not if war doesn't know that town exists, Cr"
11-03-2018T22:11:02,CrRAR,Raine is like the one person that knows kind of where it is.

11-03-2018T23:07:15,unsteddyphoenix,It was amazing
11-03-2018T23:07:22,Dadrobit,Yes
11-03-2018T23:07:29,Dadrobit,S'what I did.
11-03-2018T23:07:48,Twokinds,"And instead of bread, it's spaghetti"
11-03-2018T23:08:25,SpazztasticKiwi,So you want spaghetti in the form of pizza?
11-03-2018T23:08:28,unsteddyphoenix,Careful with that

11-03-2018T23:14:29,Bgrmystr2,what's wrong with what he did?
11-03-2018T23:15:17,SpazztasticKiwi,What I read is that it was canned spaghetti stuff and he ended up making a hoppy mess of it
11-03-2018T23:15:18,unsteddyphoenix,You can make any pizza but doesnt mean people arent allowed to get mad at your pizza
11-03-2018T23:15:22,unsteddyphoenix,Thats not how freedom of pizza works

11-03-2018T23:20:33,SpazztasticKiwi,But they’re also expensive as hell
11-03-2018T23:21:50,Bgrmystr2,"People are fucking idiots. If a guy wants to make a sloppy pizza w/ canned spaghetti, who in the FUCK are they to judge it? It's not their pizza. xD"

11-03-2018T23:26:15,Bgrmystr2,yeah people do that kiwi
11-03-2018T23:27:20,unsteddyphoenix,One time I soaked skittles in vodka
11-03-2018T23:27:25,unsteddyphoenix,Turned the vodka red
11-03-2018T23:27:29,Dadrobit,"Ohhhhh, that's a good time"
11-03-2018T23:27:40,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah would do again
11-03-2018T23:28:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Ever heard of “vodquila”?
11-03-2018T23:28:30,Bgrmystr2,did the skittles taste like vodka? Or did the vodka taste like skittles?
11-03-2018T23:29:02,unsteddyphoenix,I threw away the skittles 'cause the vodka sucked out all the flavour
11-03-2018T23:29:10,Bgrmystr2,rip
11-03-2018T23:29:11,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s a brand of vodka/tequila hybrid mixture
11-03-2018T23:29:15,unsteddyphoenix,But the vodka tasted a bit like skittles yeah
11-03-2018T23:29:20,Bgrmystr2,nice
11-03-2018T23:29:23,unsteddyphoenix,Spazz that sounds like a bad time lol
11-03-2018T23:29:44,Bgrmystr2,too bad I'll never know if the vodka pierced the skittle shell and made the whole skittle taste like vodka :(
11-03-2018T23:30:04,Bgrmystr2,Questions forever gone unanswered..
11-03-2018T23:30:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Why erase your history when you can wipe your entire hard drive?
11-03-2018T23:30:15,Bgrmystr2,cuz you don't want to erase everything..?
11-03-2018T23:30:42,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s what I imagine vodquila does
11-03-2018T23:31:14,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
11-03-2018T23:31:28,SpazztasticKiwi,And Jack Daniels has a line of whiskey infused coffee
11-03-2018T23:31:58,Dadrobit,"But... That's what it's supposed to do. The alcohol swaps out with the sugars. You don't do it to get tasty alcoholic treats, you do it to get buzzed off of solid alcohol."
11-03-2018T23:32:35,Dadrobit,semi-solid
11-03-2018T23:32:40,Bgrmystr2,But what if I want tasty alchoholic treats? ._.
