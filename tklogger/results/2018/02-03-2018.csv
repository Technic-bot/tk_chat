02-03-2018T00:04:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Some people can eat a whole chocolate cake and not gain an ounce. I look at the thing and I gain five pounds
02-03-2018T00:04:34,Tharkis,trying  to re-lose the 5lbs i put on over winter atm
02-03-2018T00:04:35,Nekonny,XD
02-03-2018T00:04:52,Tharkis,so i can start back on losing the final 20 for the 2 year goal of drop 50lbs in 2 years i set last year &gt;_&lt;
02-03-2018T00:05:04,Tharkis,2lbs a month
02-03-2018T00:05:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve lost 27 pounds of my high school weight
02-03-2018T00:05:18,Twokinds,"I had heartburn a couple times. It was scary, thought I was having a heart attack the first time."
02-03-2018T00:05:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Still trying to lose that last 10 pounds.
02-03-2018T00:05:42,Tharkis,i get chronic heartburn =/  tums are my friend
02-03-2018T00:05:57,Bgrmystr2,I can lose and gain 20-30 pounds within a single day. Our scale is trash.
02-03-2018T00:06:02,BluePhantom90,Oh Tom when you have a heart attack you can't feel your right arm at first
02-03-2018T00:06:04,SpazztasticKiwi,And you‚Äôre too young to be having any heart attacks
02-03-2018T00:06:12,Kyslyrn,Thats an impressivly bad scale
02-03-2018T00:06:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,left arm
02-03-2018T00:06:22,Tharkis,"went to the doctors because i thought i had heart problems, chest pain radiating into  my left arm"
02-03-2018T00:06:22,BadFoMo,"A little late, but; Sketch Request; ALL the donuts catch up with Laura?"
02-03-2018T00:06:24,Bgrmystr2,Blue wat
02-03-2018T00:06:31,SageSaga,my father thought he was having heart burn when it turned out to be a heart attack
02-03-2018T00:06:35,BluePhantom90,I saw a guy have a heart attack at age 29.
02-03-2018T00:06:48,NezumiYuki,Oh ouch Sage!
02-03-2018T00:07:02,Tharkis,turns out there's a nerve that runs along the side of your esophogus and in some people heartburn bothers that nerve and can make heartburn give heart attack like symptoms
02-03-2018T00:07:02,BluePhantom90,When you can't feel your arm that is a sign of having a heart attack
02-03-2018T00:07:05,BadFoMo,Dang!
02-03-2018T00:07:18,Tharkis,and since i lost my grandad from a heart attack at50 it scared me
02-03-2018T00:07:30,Ordithus,"Or you need to roll off of your arm, because it's asleep"
02-03-2018T00:07:49,ItsActuallyKopyKat,^^
02-03-2018T00:07:50,Bgrmystr2,lol ord
02-03-2018T00:07:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"Yes it‚Äôs possible, but unless it runs in the family or he has certain other factors, he too young"
02-03-2018T00:07:59,SageSaga,"he was like ""You have had heartburn before- it feels like a blowtorch right here right?"" and pointed at his heart"" and i was like ""NO- NO IT DOESNT"""
02-03-2018T00:08:00,BluePhantom90,No it would feel like pins and needles when your arm is asleep
02-03-2018T00:08:22,Bgrmystr2,it did for me sage O.o
02-03-2018T00:08:26,Ordithus,That's after the blood flows again. blue
02-03-2018T00:08:27,BrunoYcaro,"gonna get some sleep,have fun people!"
02-03-2018T00:08:35,BadFoMo,Good night.

02-03-2018T00:08:36,Ordithus,Night Bruno
02-03-2018T00:08:43,NezumiYuki,G'night Bruno  ^^
02-03-2018T00:08:55,Tharkis,i fell asleep once somehow with my arms crossed undernath me
02-03-2018T00:08:58,SageSaga,heartburn doesnt come from the heart it comes from the top of the stomach and up through the throat
02-03-2018T00:09:00,BluePhantom90,But I when you can't feel as in you pinch and poke your arm you can't feel it
02-03-2018T00:09:04,Tharkis,and woke up with both arms totally asleep
02-03-2018T00:09:07,BluePhantom90,that is the first sign
02-03-2018T00:09:11,Tharkis,couldnt feel eithe rarm they just flopped around
02-03-2018T00:09:18,Tharkis,couldnt push myself up to flip over
02-03-2018T00:09:21,Ordithus,lol
02-03-2018T00:09:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I once woke up and my right arm was so asleep I thought I‚Äôd lost it
02-03-2018T00:09:36,Bgrmystr2,yeah I know that lol
02-03-2018T00:09:40,Tharkis,but holy cow the tingly pain when they woke up was uncomfortable
02-03-2018T00:09:50,SageSaga,Tharkis- i did that with one of my arms before - and ended up slapping myself with my noodle like arm
02-03-2018T00:10:00,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
02-03-2018T00:10:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Self five
02-03-2018T00:10:19,Bgrmystr2,Sage slapped himself with a noodle arm.
02-03-2018T00:10:26,Bgrmystr2,so proud of you
02-03-2018T00:10:32,Tharkis,noodle arms.  Like Ed in Cowboy Bebop when they get electrocuted =D
02-03-2018T00:10:33,ZRO4825,woke up a week or two ago with an arm completely asleep. That was freaky.
02-03-2018T00:10:34,SageSaga,i also had one do that and felt it with my other arm- i freaked out because it was like i touched someones arm that was coming out from the top of my bed
02-03-2018T00:10:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,achievement unlocked
02-03-2018T00:10:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,bleep boop
02-03-2018T00:10:53,NezumiYuki,Where dat noodle tongue of Reni?
02-03-2018T00:10:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I was trying to move mine and it wasn‚Äôt working
02-03-2018T00:11:02,NezumiYuki,show da emoji!
02-03-2018T00:11:17,ZRO4825,"That's the creepy part of it. Trying to move the arm and it just sits there like ""nuh uh, ain't doin it"""
02-03-2018T00:11:29,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-renirawr: the Dragon Princess takes no orders
02-03-2018T00:11:31,ZRO4825,And if you pick it up with your other arm it's SO crazy heavy.
02-03-2018T00:11:53,Bgrmystr2,and you gotta make sure you bend it properly
02-03-2018T00:11:58,BluePhantom90,Also i you cut blood from circulating from your arm or hand it would have a burning feeling.
02-03-2018T00:12:07,Bgrmystr2,cuz otherwise you'll bend it all wrong and it'll be worse when you feel it again
02-03-2018T00:12:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"when that happens Zro, my first thought is always aliens"
02-03-2018T00:12:22,BluePhantom90,and I mean completely cut circulation.
02-03-2018T00:12:33,Tharkis,"but yeah, i'll admit the fact that i get easy chronic heart burn AND my heart burn symptoms are similar to 'warning signs for heart attack' gives me anxiety some times =/"
02-03-2018T00:12:56,ZRO4825,Seems reasonable to me.
02-03-2018T00:13:01,Tharkis,"my cousn has the exact same thing he's like 'i'm 28 and i cant tell if i'm having a heart attack or if the pizza disagreed with me, it sucks!"""
02-03-2018T00:14:08,Bgrmystr2,"Thark.. if the pizza disagreed with him, then the pain would come from his hips"
02-03-2018T00:14:10,Bgrmystr2,not his chest
02-03-2018T00:14:17,Bgrmystr2,there's a huge difference
02-03-2018T00:14:24,Bgrmystr2,a gut pain is not the same as a chest pain
02-03-2018T00:14:37,ZRO4825,Heartburn hits higher up.
02-03-2018T00:14:46,BluePhantom90,I had heart burn once but many times where my chest felt like it was bring crushed or stabbed in the side
02-03-2018T00:14:54,Tharkis,"my doctor had me take a pepcid a day (well, generic one) for like a year on end."
02-03-2018T00:15:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Who does makeup on set
02-03-2018T00:15:47,Tharkis,"said the other ones, zantac, nexium, etc are bad long term, but pepcid works more like an antihistimine / allergy medication, instead of a blocker"
02-03-2018T00:15:51,Ordithus,Maren
02-03-2018T00:16:05,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"No, the triplets!"
02-03-2018T00:16:13,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"""Meow, meow"""
02-03-2018T00:16:27,Tharkis,meow?!
02-03-2018T00:16:44,Bgrmystr2,"you say meow, all I think of is zro with his mow mow img"

02-03-2018T00:18:00,ZRO4825,Mow! :o
02-03-2018T00:18:05,Tharkis,no wonder i'm sleepy
02-03-2018T00:18:06,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-daydreamingkat: Thank you Marshall
02-03-2018T00:18:21,Bgrmystr2,"lol, was it marshall that paid for this?"

02-03-2018T02:20:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"It works sometimes, but am I weird to say it seems like rewarding bad behavior?"
02-03-2018T02:20:27,ZRO4825,"That's...not a good idea, handing them something they may want for crying reinforces their behavior. &lt;_&lt;;"
02-03-2018T02:20:57,Dadrobit,"Dunno, the show, but I know what you're ttalking about"
02-03-2018T02:21:10,Bgrmystr2,"lol sage I know that too, but never saw whatever show it was from"
02-03-2018T02:21:17,OokamiSpiritWolf,stream is lagging for me e.e
02-03-2018T02:21:27,OokamiSpiritWolf,I think its because of my downloads
02-03-2018T02:21:40,Bgrmystr2,probably.
02-03-2018T02:21:44,Dadrobit,I never got ~that~ loud though lol. I just picked the line up from my father. S'how he did it.
02-03-2018T02:21:55,Bgrmystr2,Downloads tend to do that
02-03-2018T02:21:59,aeoronwah,I just got attacked by diablo in MHW

02-03-2018T02:22:19,SageSaga,hes easy
02-03-2018T02:22:22,Bgrmystr2,lotta spikes on his back?

02-03-2018T02:22:30,Dadrobit,"Nah, that's Nergigante"
02-03-2018T02:22:33,ZRO4825,^
02-03-2018T02:22:41,aeoronwah,I ain't got shit for gear
02-03-2018T02:22:44,Bgrmystr2,bad diablo reference is bad.
02-03-2018T02:22:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,sounds like meltdown Godzilla
02-03-2018T02:22:51,SageSaga,oh- i made a video on how to beat Bazelgeus for my brother- he was having problems
02-03-2018T02:23:11,ZRO4825,I can take out Nerg easier than I can Diablos. :rofl:
02-03-2018T02:23:37,ZRO4825,"Actually...not sure on that, I think I may be better than that on Diablos, I just hate him, period, lol. HATE how he just runs and runs and runs back and forth constantly. -.-"
02-03-2018T02:24:08,SageSaga,its great- it makes him predictable
02-03-2018T02:24:08,SpazztasticKiwi,What‚Äôs having a brother like?
02-03-2018T02:24:15,SageSaga,if yall are interested - https://youtu.be/00tk-cajVpQ
02-03-2018T02:24:59,Dadrobit,"Pain, Spazz, usually pain."
02-03-2018T02:25:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,thats one spiky nyna you got there
02-03-2018T02:25:35,SageSaga,for Diablos one trick is to get him to charge- dodge to the side then run up behind him- that gets him to tail slap- dive under the tail and attack under him or if you use a blunt weapon- smash his face
02-03-2018T02:26:20,SageSaga,use screamer pods when he goes underground to pop him out and get him stuck for a few seconds- wail on him then
02-03-2018T02:28:47,SageSaga,if you use a bow- getting him to charge is great because if he does the tail slap- its a perfect dragon piercer chance- and that wrecks him
02-03-2018T02:30:47,SageSaga,what i like about that video is - it is a very safe way of destroying that monster so anyone can do it
02-03-2018T02:30:53,ZRO4825,"Yeah, didn't find out 'bout the screamers till...oh, like 4 days ago? lol"
02-03-2018T02:31:55,SageSaga,"rule number one- If it flies - Flashpod, rule number 2 - if it burrows, Screamerpod"
02-03-2018T02:35:06,SageSaga,"Dragon piercer spam is great but doesnt work on everything btw- it's just great vs huge targets so i use it for Farm the final boss, Diablos sometimes, and Bazel"
02-03-2018T02:35:46,SageSaga,i prefer the power shot build- where people do nuts things like this -
02-03-2018T02:35:56,SageSaga,https://youtu.be/gw_nrHwcz98
02-03-2018T02:40:34,Bgrmystr2,I'm making Waffles :ptv-excited:

02-03-2018T02:41:48,SageSaga,its ok - im not allowed to have waffles anymore
02-03-2018T02:41:53,ZRO4825,"I have problems getting stuns and staggers it feels like. But I haven't seen too many of the ""pro"" players doing full fights either, so it may just be I'm used to seeing all their highlights where they're knocking the monster around after already like 5"
02-03-2018T02:41:57,ZRO4825,"minutes of wearing it out, lol"
02-03-2018T02:42:20,SageSaga,in solo?
02-03-2018T02:42:23,Ocean52,How do I watch vids on here?
02-03-2018T02:42:26,Dadrobit,That spreadshot damage though!
02-03-2018T02:42:35,ZRO4825,"Solo, duo, whatever works."
02-03-2018T02:42:56,ZRO4825,"Just feels like I can land headshots, legshots, and EVENTUALLY they'll start to stagger/stun, but it just seems to take forever."
02-03-2018T02:42:57,SageSaga,in solo they stagger more easily because they have less HP
02-03-2018T02:43:20,SageSaga,soon as you make it duo or more it becomes 2.6x harder
02-03-2018T02:43:28,ZRO4825,ahh

02-03-2018T02:49:06,Ocean52,Has anyone fought a tempered Kirin yet??
02-03-2018T02:49:09,SageSaga,alright well just let me know when
02-03-2018T02:49:20,SageSaga,yeah i beat Tempered Kirin already
02-03-2018T02:49:36,Ocean52,Is it best with a bow or gun?
02-03-2018T02:49:54,SageSaga,neither - well i guess Gun might be better than bow
02-03-2018T02:49:54,ZRO4825,Fought it? Yes.
02-03-2018T02:49:58,ZRO4825,Beaten it? No.
02-03-2018T02:50:21,ZRO4825,"I'm busy building a new GS to fight it with right now, actually."
02-03-2018T02:50:28,SageSaga,GS is great against it
02-03-2018T02:50:35,Ocean52,Bc I always use my nergigate great sword now for most of them all
02-03-2018T02:50:50,Ocean52,Rocking full set
02-03-2018T02:50:59,ZRO4825,"Yeah, CB is NOT serving me well against it...takes me too long to build charge. By the time I can build the next set, I've got to use it to reset shield charge"
02-03-2018T02:51:23,Ocean52,Ohhh Ic huh
02-03-2018T02:51:49,SageSaga,you either need to do hit and run attacks or attacks that can ignore his armor because-
02-03-2018T02:51:56,SageSaga,well it sucks hitting him for 0 damage XD
02-03-2018T02:52:09,ZRO4825,Not to mention the deflections

02-03-2018T03:44:17,SageSaga,I have confirmed Kaylin has danced naked under the moonlight so she needs to do that at some point
02-03-2018T03:44:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,sweet
02-03-2018T03:44:29,OokamiSpiritWolf,wut

02-03-2018T03:44:39,ZRO4825,:thinking:

02-03-2018T03:45:58,Bgrmystr2,I don't even know what kinda thing this music would describe xD

02-03-2018T03:46:17,ZRO4825,Sounds like Overlord stuff
02-03-2018T03:46:38,SageSaga,it is not Overlord
02-03-2018T03:46:57,SageSaga,it's actually from an anime i didnt like all that much- it was ok but it could have been better-
02-03-2018T03:47:04,SageSaga,the music was cool though
02-03-2018T03:47:15,Bgrmystr2,Which anime?
