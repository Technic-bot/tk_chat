27-05-2018T00:32:04,SiliconCarbide,"Tom mentioned ""he doesnt want the patreon to go a week without sketches"""
27-05-2018T00:32:09,SiliconCarbide,do we know what he has planned?
27-05-2018T00:38:33,SiliconCarbide,if he has anything planned
27-05-2018T00:49:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Pretty sure that he meant he was gonna post a few extra sketches before he left for days he’d be away
27-05-2018T00:49:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I haven’t looked yet
27-05-2018T00:52:23,SiliconCarbide,fo far we only got the sketches from last sundays stream
27-05-2018T00:52:26,SiliconCarbide,*so
27-05-2018T01:04:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I dunno. He’s having vacation. He’ll get to it when he gets back
27-05-2018T01:04:43,SiliconCarbide,yeah sure we will see
27-05-2018T01:05:32,BluePhantom90,Well after every convention Tom always seems to get sick
27-05-2018T01:06:35,SiliconCarbide,ssshhhh
27-05-2018T01:09:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Then he’ll need time to recover and then he’ll get to it
27-05-2018T01:23:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’m just happy I got a short shift tomorrow. Early shift, but short"
27-05-2018T01:24:17,SiliconCarbide,that sounds nice
27-05-2018T01:24:25,SiliconCarbide,rest of the day free then?
27-05-2018T01:41:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Should be
27-05-2018T02:19:48,Dadrobit,Tom said that he was doing sketches behind the scenes to compensate for the week without fan input.
27-05-2018T02:20:15,Dadrobit,"Also, yeah, Con-Crud is a thing, so be prepared for him to take some time to recover."
27-05-2018T02:21:17,Bgrmystr2,still dunno why ppl blame the con for somethin they got from the people there. Just seems like a misplaced blame for the name of it
27-05-2018T02:30:09,unsteddyphoenix,"""unhygienic-nerds-crud"" doesnt roll off the tongue nicely"
27-05-2018T02:30:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Carried a bottle of germx with me to PAX. Didn’t get sick after
27-05-2018T02:31:07,SpazztasticKiwi,How about “wash ya hands ya nasty crud”
27-05-2018T02:33:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Germ x and don’t touch your face. My two main rules
27-05-2018T02:49:37,Bgrmystr2,"haha phoenix, perhaps"
27-05-2018T02:49:39,Bgrmystr2,but it is more accurate
27-05-2018T02:50:01,Bgrmystr2,"I've never gotten sick after a con, so"
27-05-2018T02:50:07,Bgrmystr2,but I barely get sick anyway..
27-05-2018T02:50:17,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
27-05-2018T02:51:44,BluePhantom90,well if I am correct he is going to California the new Rich only have houses/ Poor live on the street state.
27-05-2018T02:53:21,BluePhantom90,Which has issues because the Governor of California also doesn't enforce many laws. Reason why human waste is all over the streets
27-05-2018T02:54:46,NickTheName,good morning!
27-05-2018T02:54:55,BluePhantom90,morning
27-05-2018T03:59:33,NickTheName,what are you guys doing?
27-05-2018T05:04:44,JamesBSquirrel3,"Oh Now I see on Twitter; they'll be back at 30th of May, that's what it is."
27-05-2018T05:07:26,JamesBSquirrel3,"Perhaps they'll start on Friday Night on 1st of June EST, (UK BST time 2am on 2nd on June as Saturday)"
27-05-2018T14:04:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Windy weather + long hair = can’t see
27-05-2018T14:10:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Also my aunt gave me a Miller high life and I’m not sure I’m gonna try it yet or not
27-05-2018T14:48:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve never tasted something so nasty in my life
27-05-2018T14:50:27,Xexanoth,"out of curiousitiy, what exactly is Miller High Life?"
27-05-2018T14:56:03,Trevuxnouxe,good afternoon!
27-05-2018T14:56:35,Dadrobit,"Miller High Life is a super average beer. Not terrible, not something to write home about."
27-05-2018T14:57:07,Dadrobit,Sponsors a lot of raceways and drivers.
27-05-2018T14:57:41,Dadrobit,Official sponsor of IEM Raceway out here in Phoenix actually.
27-05-2018T14:59:22,Dadrobit,"If you're afraid of it, drink it ice cold. That'll knock it into a more tasty state. The colder a drink is, the less you can generally taste it."
27-05-2018T14:59:51,Dadrobit,"Also, howdy Trev"
27-05-2018T14:59:52,SpazztasticKiwi,It was cold. Straight from the fridge. Still not a fan
27-05-2018T15:01:22,SpazztasticKiwi,We had memorial cook out at my aunts. I drove so I didn’t have anything but she told me to take one home if I wanted
27-05-2018T15:02:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"With the sodas, they also had Bud Light, Coors, and Carona - if those last two are even spelled right"
27-05-2018T15:06:10,Dadrobit,"Coors and Miller are the same company iirc, never actually had a Coors, but I can't imagine it tastes much different."
27-05-2018T15:06:28,Dadrobit,Bud Light is literally water.
27-05-2018T15:07:40,Dadrobit,Corona is probably the worst of the bunch.
27-05-2018T15:08:03,Dadrobit,"We get a lot of it here being close to Mexico, I really don't see the appeal, but to each their own."
27-05-2018T15:08:32,Xexanoth,how can Corona be worse then: literally water
27-05-2018T15:08:38,Xexanoth,*than
27-05-2018T15:09:48,Dadrobit,Because Corona has a bitterness I personally don't enjoy
27-05-2018T15:10:21,Dadrobit,Bud Light is more on the sweet end of the scale.
27-05-2018T15:10:36,Xexanoth,"well, i can relate to that, don't like bitter beers either"
27-05-2018T15:15:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"All I can say is I don’t see myself ever drinking alcohol. Doesn’t appeal to me in any case, and trying the Miller didn’t help"
27-05-2018T15:18:39,Dadrobit,Each their of of course :D
27-05-2018T15:19:15,Dadrobit,"Tbh, the only beer I actually ~enjoy~ is from a local brewery out in AZ called Four Peaks."
27-05-2018T15:19:22,SiliconCarbide,beer is an acquired taste after all
27-05-2018T15:19:28,SiliconCarbide,good evening btw
27-05-2018T15:19:36,SpazztasticKiwi,My dad had an issue with alcohol anyway so it’s probably not wise to tempt fate there
27-05-2018T15:19:39,Dadrobit,They have a Peach Ale that's actually tasty as all get out.
27-05-2018T15:19:54,Dadrobit,Haven't had one in years though.
27-05-2018T15:25:49,Dadrobit,"Just checked the forums and I'm ready to dispense with the ""Creepiest Comment of the Month Award""!"
27-05-2018T15:26:24,Dadrobit,"""Who knows if [Maddie] is as young as she claims. Aside from Tom... The only way to be sure of that is to check her nude body."""
27-05-2018T15:26:38,SiliconCarbide,yikes
27-05-2018T15:26:39,Dadrobit,-Hulk10
27-05-2018T15:27:28,Xexanoth,"for the internet, thats like a 2 out of 10 on the creep o meter"
27-05-2018T15:28:07,SiliconCarbide,i feel like that should not be a standard
27-05-2018T15:28:22,Dadrobit,"Eh, maybe compared to the BME PO, or Lemon Party. But this is still original content creepy."
27-05-2018T15:29:10,Dadrobit,This guy's got/is getting a reputation for being awkwardly creepy.
27-05-2018T15:29:35,SiliconCarbide,whats bme po stand for?
27-05-2018T15:29:36,Xexanoth,"i mean, we've had worse stuff being talked about in chat during streams"
27-05-2018T15:29:45,Dadrobit,BME Pain Olympics
27-05-2018T15:29:53,Dadrobit,"Don't, just don't."
27-05-2018T15:30:20,SiliconCarbide,&lt;.&lt;
27-05-2018T15:30:28,Dadrobit,"Generally, if it get's worse than someone wanting to inspect a potential minor's nude body, then that person is banned."
27-05-2018T15:30:51,Xexanoth,"his comment boils down to ""i wanna see a character nude"" which is pretty harmless..."
27-05-2018T15:30:58,Xexanoth,"well, kinda depends on the age of the author"
27-05-2018T15:31:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"I hope he realizes that seeing a woman nude isn’t gonna give you an accurate age all the time, in fact it’s a pretty bad way to gauge age"
27-05-2018T15:31:55,SiliconCarbide,whelp that was a fun googling
27-05-2018T15:31:59,SiliconCarbide,im done for today
27-05-2018T15:31:59,Xexanoth,"beside it's maddie, so all he has to do is look at a nude from keith XD"
27-05-2018T15:32:06,Xexanoth,*pic
27-05-2018T15:32:16,Dadrobit,"I suspect this person is on the younger end of the spectrum from their lack of decorum in their post history, early teens maybe."
27-05-2018T15:32:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Great. A horny teen
27-05-2018T15:32:51,Xexanoth,"so, an early teen want's to see another teen naked, big shock, the horror etc... *rolls eyes*"
27-05-2018T15:33:27,Dadrobit,"Very little forum etiquette. Often double posts, necros super old threads, makes inane comments and threads constantly. Stuff like that."
27-05-2018T15:33:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"As long as he’s more mature irl, it shouldn’t be too much of a problem"
27-05-2018T15:33:57,Dadrobit,"When it's someone they believe is 13? Yeah, that's up there on the creep factor."
27-05-2018T15:34:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though even discussing such things is an indicator they’ve thought on it, and can be a bit of a flag"
27-05-2018T15:36:05,SpazztasticKiwi,To me Maddie is mature enough to live pretty independent but she’s still learning like everyone else
27-05-2018T15:37:10,Xexanoth,"considering the current comic page literally has maddie talking about sex, she's clearly reached ""teen"" status as a character"
27-05-2018T15:38:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Well any girl old enough to have started a period learns of sex kinda by default
27-05-2018T15:38:34,SpazztasticKiwi,And since that kind of thing can happen at any age as young as like 9....
27-05-2018T15:39:06,Xexanoth,those are outliers though
27-05-2018T15:41:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok so say shes the standard 13 at the least. Her knowledge could be a part of their culture - teach them so their prepared as a standard so they’re not left uninformed
27-05-2018T15:42:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Though with her mischievousness she may have overheard that kind of information rather than being told
27-05-2018T15:43:05,SpazztasticKiwi,At least she knows though. That’s kinda the important part
27-05-2018T15:44:37,Xexanoth,"lore wise, i doubt Basitin would give an actual poition to a ""child"" also her description reads: Her child-like appearance makes her dangerous to those who underestimate her"
27-05-2018T15:45:04,Xexanoth,"generaly you don'T describe actual children as having a ""child like appearance"""
27-05-2018T15:45:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"I wanna say she’s at least 18ish - like I said, she seems to live pretty independently"
27-05-2018T15:46:59,Xexanoth,"she might be around around Karens age, who according to the page is 16. Which would fit the whole ""teen"" vibe that the last comic page had"
27-05-2018T15:47:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"And as for the child like thing, yeah. I’ve been told I have a very young face. It’s not something you call an actual child"
27-05-2018T15:48:15,SpazztasticKiwi,More something you use to describe an older person that you thought was a teen without sounding too insulting
27-05-2018T15:48:33,Bgrmystr2,"basitins are pretty prudish to sex, so of course they're going to react like teenagers of the subject"
27-05-2018T15:48:42,Bgrmystr2,that doesn't mean they ARE teenaged
27-05-2018T15:49:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"It’s not something normal people tend to discuss in regular conversation either, let alone someone they just met"
27-05-2018T15:49:36,Xexanoth,"Yeah, but her Mom is Adelaide so..."
27-05-2018T16:45:17,Trevuxnouxe,THAT REMINDS ME I NEED TO FINISH READING THROUGH TWOKINDS CHAPTER 10!!!
27-05-2018T16:45:33,Trevuxnouxe,caps lock was on*
27-05-2018T19:46:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I woke up from a nap and thought I was late for work eventhough I’d just gotten home from work
