26-01-2018T00:10:40,Nekonny,for her age?
26-01-2018T00:10:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Reni is dragon lite
26-01-2018T00:10:44,Ordithus,Normal dragon = the only other dragon we've seen
26-01-2018T00:10:54,CrRAR,"lol Tharkis, almost typed that"
26-01-2018T00:10:56,unsteddyphoenix,Depends how small she's supposed to be. She did just carry 4 people though.
26-01-2018T00:10:59,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah that's what I figure, Nora's normal, but that wouldn't make her not-big to humans and keidran"

26-01-2018T00:12:58,BluePhantom90,"yeah how would Reni handle holding Trace, Flora, Keith and Nat. I remember having to pack a C-130 and if you put too much weight in it, well it wouldn't fly so well"
26-01-2018T00:13:14,Bgrmystr2,Reni hasn't been entirely size-persistant for the pages she's been on
26-01-2018T00:13:15,Combak,I think those too messages have the users reversed.
26-01-2018T00:13:19,Bgrmystr2,sometimes she looks smaller

26-01-2018T00:15:07,unsteddyphoenix,"They would have to reduce size too, 'cause in every page with reni flying the bags are pretty small compared to her."

26-01-2018T00:28:59,zolstarym,that is pretty sad in a way
26-01-2018T00:29:09,Combak,IP ban prevents that @WarToWin.
