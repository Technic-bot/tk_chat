16-06-2018T15:56:00,MallardDuckAvia,All tigers are inherently female. It just a takes a certain chemical to make them male at the correct time in development. If we deny them this chemical they stay female. It‚Äôs just like the Dinosaurs in Jurassic Park
16-06-2018T15:56:01,unsteddyphoenix,I absolutely did not
16-06-2018T15:56:05,JamesBSquirrel3,Well I cannot say but they live South-east Rainforest tribe.

16-06-2018T21:54:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Tempy
16-06-2018T21:54:20,ShadowSoap,0.0
16-06-2018T21:54:21,JackyCheng,yeah the baby got ear
16-06-2018T21:54:39,Dadrobit,"They got that poster up fast, being able to confirm his desertion even before he left the city."
16-06-2018T21:54:47,goldgardian,That's not daniels.
16-06-2018T21:54:53,goldgardian,black hair
16-06-2018T21:54:56,Twokinds,bright orange hair is probably a safe bet
16-06-2018T21:55:05,CrRAR,tru
16-06-2018T21:55:32,Dadrobit,I think that poster is just low resolution and the hair is more implied than accurate.
16-06-2018T21:55:34,Tharkis,ginger kitteh ! \o/
16-06-2018T21:55:41,Ordithus,But human skin ears :ptv-grossedout:

16-06-2018T21:55:50,BluePhantom90,yeah I think therie's father will help them
16-06-2018T21:55:50,Dadrobit,Could be a different person though.
16-06-2018T21:55:53,Katfeathers,also helm
16-06-2018T21:56:00,goldgardian,I bet it's Lt.Reed
16-06-2018T21:56:31,ShadowSoap,"I mean, he could've just dyed his hair to be harder to identify."
16-06-2018T21:56:42,CrRAR,that's okay then... the resistence grows~
16-06-2018T21:57:04,MrEase,this took a somewhat darker turn
16-06-2018T21:57:06,BadFoMo,@BluePhantom90 Inb4 The Templar is already there looking for them.
16-06-2018T21:57:13,MrEase,I like it though
16-06-2018T21:57:15,goldgardian,...kinda wonder how much magic Daniels knows...
16-06-2018T21:57:20,Combak,I'm glad it did!
16-06-2018T21:57:28,Ordithus,This one is gooood
16-06-2018T21:57:42,ShadowSoap,Probably very little. He is just a simple guard.
16-06-2018T21:57:42,BluePhantom90,yeah this might get colored
16-06-2018T21:58:06,Dadrobit,"Yeah, as much as I would've preferred Euchre and Mary, I like that this one went dark."
16-06-2018T21:58:09,TorqueEmUp,Yeah definitely getting a color vote from me
16-06-2018T21:58:13,goldgardian,...were the towers always red?
16-06-2018T21:58:14,Vexd,"Tower firing, bad is happening"
16-06-2018T21:58:24,Dadrobit,Leaves an opening for someone to suggest that they eventually get caught.

16-06-2018T22:28:13,CrRAR,daniels vs daddy seh-van
16-06-2018T22:28:23,MuonNeutrino,"@TheFDdriver well, looking at the recording the last one was another daniels/37 one, but haven't gotten the recap yet"
16-06-2018T22:28:33,Bgrmystr2,that's reserved for a particular level of crazy

16-06-2018T22:30:07,Ordithus,very
16-06-2018T22:30:10,MuonNeutrino,@TheFDdriver well i just got to the recap so i'll list em in a sec
16-06-2018T22:30:32,CrRAR,then daniels and Therie flee society
16-06-2018T22:30:34,TheFDdriver,So I miss good sketches?
16-06-2018T22:30:47,Ordithus,Did you miss a sketch?  Then yes.
16-06-2018T22:30:57,Bgrmystr2,agree w/ ord
16-06-2018T22:31:01,CrRAR,lol
16-06-2018T22:31:11,TheFDdriver,7 in total?
16-06-2018T22:31:14,Ordithus,Yep
16-06-2018T22:31:20,Dadrobit,"Dunno, you could probably miss the slav squat one and be in good standings."
16-06-2018T22:31:24,TheFDdriver,then 7
16-06-2018T22:31:26,Ordithus,"Oh, yeah..."
16-06-2018T22:31:30,Bgrmystr2,yeah but
16-06-2018T22:31:32,Bgrmystr2,someone enjoyed that
16-06-2018T22:31:33,FenceEqualizer,Since they're fleeing does that mean both parents disapprove Daniel and Therie?
16-06-2018T22:31:43,Ordithus,Society disapproves
16-06-2018T22:31:47,unsteddyphoenix,"both societies, at least"
16-06-2018T22:31:56,Bgrmystr2,"no fence, you see the bigass glowing templar spoiler in the background"
16-06-2018T22:31:58,Ordithus,"At least the human one, tigers presumably"
16-06-2018T22:32:04,CrRAR,stupid societies
16-06-2018T22:32:12,Dadrobit,Which is kind of.... Weird being that they're in good standings with the war going on.
16-06-2018T22:32:17,Ordithus,Basitins might accept them to live there in peace
16-06-2018T22:32:32,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, daniel's parents didn't seem to miffed about it"
16-06-2018T22:32:37,FenceEqualizer,Bah I know the others would disapprove but not so parents!
16-06-2018T22:32:37,Dadrobit,"I mean, I get that ther'd be resistance, but totally leaving seems extreme."
16-06-2018T22:32:46,Dadrobit,there'd*
16-06-2018T22:32:50,Ordithus,"Well, Robit, there's being at peace, and then there's interbreeding"
16-06-2018T22:32:56,unsteddyphoenix,It would probably get political really quick
16-06-2018T22:33:01,FenceEqualizer,Also I missed the giant tower kinda dancing between stream and other things
16-06-2018T22:33:17,unsteddyphoenix,There'd be people who try to cover it up and people who try to spread the word as much as possible
16-06-2018T22:33:25,Ordithus,Parallels to America all over in that
16-06-2018T22:33:27,unsteddyphoenix,It'd get very complicated very fast
16-06-2018T22:33:47,unsteddyphoenix,"Even if everyone was chill with it, ut means no more peace for them, even if"
16-06-2018T22:33:54,TheFDdriver,"very racist, very fast"
16-06-2018T22:34:00,Dadrobit,"Yeah, but I mean, keidran are actually bred to be sex slaves by humans, so it's not like it's ~that~ out of the ordinary that there'd be a couple."
16-06-2018T22:34:16,Ordithus,It was only in like the 90s when interracial couples were accepted
16-06-2018T22:34:21,unsteddyphoenix,A baby between them though
16-06-2018T22:34:28,TheFDdriver,thats the problem
16-06-2018T22:34:29,Dadrobit,Blame the keidran infidelity.
16-06-2018T22:34:38,unsteddyphoenix,Except it looks weird
16-06-2018T22:34:41,unsteddyphoenix,Presumably
16-06-2018T22:34:45,Ordithus,That's pretty unfair to Therie
16-06-2018T22:35:20,CrRAR,Well the humans are escalating and remember the masks anticipate something catastrophic happening... to the Keidran.
16-06-2018T22:35:27,Dadrobit,Well maybe 37 could speak up for once.
16-06-2018T22:35:27,CrRAR,hence possibility of babies

16-06-2018T22:37:48,unsteddyphoenix,I mean...
16-06-2018T22:37:50,Dadrobit,"Yeah, still not a fan of that scene."

16-06-2018T22:39:06,FenceEqualizer,Though I like his design
16-06-2018T22:39:08,CrRAR,Flora has it in 'er. Remember the time she rambo'd up?
16-06-2018T22:39:16,Ordithus,I think they stopped worrying about giving Flora crap after Trace saved the day and Flora glomped him
16-06-2018T22:39:36,CrRAR,then today happened and she got stranded in a tree xD
16-06-2018T22:39:37,unsteddyphoenix,She just needs the bandanna
16-06-2018T22:39:44,unsteddyphoenix,Thats the secret
16-06-2018T22:39:44,CrRAR,yus
16-06-2018T22:39:46,Dadrobit,Infinite ammo
16-06-2018T22:39:54,FenceEqualizer,Hah
16-06-2018T22:40:03,CrRAR,lol
16-06-2018T22:40:13,Ordithus,bandana for serious mode

16-06-2018T22:43:49,Ordithus,daka daka daka daka
16-06-2018T22:54:03,Dadrobit,The battle cry of Flora probably - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFDW9b_ejfI&t=1m8s
16-06-2018T22:54:51,Bgrmystr2,xDDD
16-06-2018T22:54:56,Bgrmystr2,that was somethin.
16-06-2018T22:55:06,unsteddyphoenix,oh Halloween covered this I think
16-06-2018T22:55:41,unsteddyphoenix,Unironically like this song lo
16-06-2018T22:56:43,Dadrobit,Actually same. My brother in law had this song on his playlist at his last wedding a few months ago and you better believe we karaoke'd the shit out of it.
16-06-2018T22:57:13,Dadrobit,"I guess he's not really my brother in law anymore, but he kinda is."
16-06-2018T22:57:24,unsteddyphoenix,thats ambititous
16-06-2018T22:57:45,BluePhantom90,lol I know this would be rated R. But Trace and Flora compete with Keith and Nat in bed
16-06-2018T22:58:00,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:
16-06-2018T22:58:01,Dadrobit,The rating you're looking for is NC-17
16-06-2018T22:58:10,BluePhantom90,hearing between the walls
16-06-2018T22:58:18,Dadrobit,"Also, nothing is ambitious if you have enough drugs in you."
16-06-2018T22:58:38,BluePhantom90,Well Tom did that one with Maddie hidding under Trace and Flora's bed when they were doing it
16-06-2018T22:58:45,Ordithus,who is more vocal Flora or Keith
16-06-2018T22:58:56,BluePhantom90,lol
16-06-2018T22:58:56,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha
16-06-2018T22:59:02,Dadrobit,"Flora, Keith probably has a ball gag."
16-06-2018T22:59:15,unsteddyphoenix,"Ahh, daddy's thinking"
16-06-2018T22:59:22,BluePhantom90,lol
16-06-2018T22:59:35,FenceEqualizer,Wtf
16-06-2018T22:59:36,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
16-06-2018T22:59:49,Dadrobit,"Flora ""The safe word is Templar"""
16-06-2018T23:00:51,FenceEqualizer,When you miss half the conversation
16-06-2018T23:01:03,BluePhantom90,lol
16-06-2018T23:01:33,BluePhantom90,Nat doesn't give Keith the safe word
16-06-2018T23:04:55,Dadrobit,Keith in a ball gag would almost make a good pfp https://i.imgur.com/yWV4Aiu.png
16-06-2018T23:06:24,BluePhantom90,forgetting Basitins are strong and another side pic. Basitins like their Females Dominate
16-06-2018T23:06:55,Ordithus,Laura is a lewd girl
16-06-2018T23:06:58,Bgrmystr2,why...?
16-06-2018T23:08:09,Dadrobit,"Has anyone meme'd Laura with a ""I don't feel so good"" yet?"
16-06-2018T23:08:23,Dadrobit,Her turning to dust is too good an opportunity to pass up.
16-06-2018T23:08:27,unsteddyphoenix,lol
16-06-2018T23:08:29,BluePhantom90,yeah
16-06-2018T23:08:33,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-LauraCry: it hurts
16-06-2018T23:08:35,unsteddyphoenix,she turns to dust and the dust flies into the urn
16-06-2018T23:09:24,BluePhantom90,maybe have Wolfpool vacuuming up Laura's ashes.
16-06-2018T23:09:28,FenceEqualizer,Someone contact Neon
16-06-2018T23:09:43,Dadrobit,This happened https://i.imgur.com/9tPvSZ5.jpg
16-06-2018T23:10:12,Bgrmystr2,I saw that already
16-06-2018T23:10:25,unsteddyphoenix,jesus
16-06-2018T23:10:32,Dadrobit,Was surprised that they didn't see the Laura connections.
16-06-2018T23:10:42,unsteddyphoenix,very upsetting
16-06-2018T23:10:55,FenceEqualizer,Why...?
16-06-2018T23:11:17,Bgrmystr2,well
16-06-2018T23:11:17,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúEric doesn‚Äôt love me. That‚Äôs ok. Guess I‚Äôll fade into nothing‚Äù
16-06-2018T23:11:24,Dadrobit,Done by Thundervolt on the forums. Dude's usually just obsessed with Kiwis.
16-06-2018T23:11:25,FenceEqualizer,Jeebus
16-06-2018T23:11:27,Bgrmystr2,triangles are not the same as dust
16-06-2018T23:11:38,Bgrmystr2,so it's not a great connection honestly
16-06-2018T23:11:48,unsteddyphoenix,and yet he hurts me this way
16-06-2018T23:11:52,unsteddyphoenix,Ironic
16-06-2018T23:12:03,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
16-06-2018T23:12:07,Dadrobit,Guy has a 360 chapter book on the forums about his kiwi adventures.
16-06-2018T23:12:26,unsteddyphoenix,Uhh
16-06-2018T23:12:30,unsteddyphoenix,"Like, made up?"
16-06-2018T23:12:47,Dadrobit,Yes.
16-06-2018T23:13:03,Dadrobit,It's a sci-fi fantasy adventure iirc.
16-06-2018T23:13:59,Dadrobit,I read the first bit. It's almost so bad that it's good. But it isn't quite there so I never really got into it past the first few pages.
16-06-2018T23:14:34,unsteddyphoenix,Its not bad enough or good enough
16-06-2018T23:14:38,unsteddyphoenix,The opposite of a sweet spot
16-06-2018T23:14:43,Dadrobit,"""this is a picture of a kiwi. They are very vicious and live only in New Zealand."" Can you confirm or deny these allegations of Kiwi aggression?"
16-06-2018T23:15:35,unsteddyphoenix,I once saw a non-domestic kiwi put it's head into an outstretched hand for what I can only assume to be a desire for pets
16-06-2018T23:16:01,Dadrobit,My life is a lie
16-06-2018T23:16:03,Ordithus,aww
16-06-2018T23:16:11,unsteddyphoenix,It's like they know they have no means of defense or escape so they're just chill.
16-06-2018T23:16:17,unsteddyphoenix,"Kind of like our country in general, actually."
16-06-2018T23:16:19,unsteddyphoenix,Huh.
16-06-2018T23:18:02,Dadrobit,Just get the All Black to do a Haka and scare the invaders off.
16-06-2018T23:18:31,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao that sentence
16-06-2018T23:18:40,unsteddyphoenix,You right though
16-06-2018T23:18:58,Ordithus,Scare or impress
16-06-2018T23:19:27,Dadrobit,All Blacks*
16-06-2018T23:20:45,unsteddyphoenix,Better
16-06-2018T23:21:16,unsteddyphoenix,"Also it's more ""THE haka"" generally"
16-06-2018T23:21:48,Dadrobit,lol
16-06-2018T23:22:06,Dadrobit,My NZ knowledge has increased.
16-06-2018T23:23:02,unsteddyphoenix,Do a cheeky haka with the lads
16-06-2018T23:23:06,unsteddyphoenix,Spook invaders
16-06-2018T23:31:26,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz: Good night!
16-06-2018T23:33:55,unsteddyphoenix,'night
16-06-2018T23:37:18,Dadrobit,Night.
16-06-2018T23:37:32,Dadrobit,Gonna head out for a bit myself and do some home work.
16-06-2018T23:38:20,unsteddyphoenix,good luck~
16-06-2018T23:38:27,Dadrobit,"Oh, and Tom, if you're here, I saw that you updated the Sythe/Nibbs sketch! Really fantastic stuff my man!"
16-06-2018T23:38:34,Dadrobit,Much thanks again!
16-06-2018T23:38:43,Twokinds,Glad you liked it :)
16-06-2018T23:38:46,Bgrmystr2,"yeah I was gonna ask if you saw it, but yeh"
16-06-2018T23:38:50,Bgrmystr2,it does look damn amazing
16-06-2018T23:38:53,Bgrmystr2,well done on it
16-06-2018T23:39:06,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
16-06-2018T23:39:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Everyone loves a good Nibbly sketch :ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
16-06-2018T23:40:16,Twokinds,I like drawing cool stuff sometimes
16-06-2018T23:40:35,unsteddyphoenix,Only sometimes?
16-06-2018T23:40:53,Twokinds,"Doesn't have to always be jokes, fanservice, and Theire XD"
16-06-2018T23:41:16,unsteddyphoenix,3rd one is basically just a mix of the other two
16-06-2018T23:41:34,Twokinds,True true
16-06-2018T23:41:42,unsteddyphoenix,"The ""cool"" requests are pretty rare yeah."
16-06-2018T23:42:21,unsteddyphoenix,"I like them a lot, but I rarely request them~"
16-06-2018T23:44:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt really see the obsession with Theire
16-06-2018T23:44:43,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah I dont really understand these ""trends"" in general."
16-06-2018T23:44:45,FenceEqualizer,People like seeing side characters.
16-06-2018T23:45:00,unsteddyphoenix,But theyre not side characters! Theyre BACKGROUND characters
16-06-2018T23:45:06,FenceEqualizer,That too
16-06-2018T23:45:13,SpazztasticKiwi,So do I but variety is the spice o life
16-06-2018T23:45:42,SpazztasticKiwi,And good food
16-06-2018T23:45:55,Dadrobit,I like to think that my suggestions offer a fair bit of variety.
16-06-2018T23:46:00,FenceEqualizer,Agreed.
16-06-2018T23:46:30,unsteddyphoenix,Mine dont~
16-06-2018T23:46:36,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, sometimes?"
16-06-2018T23:46:36,FenceEqualizer,Though it is harder to get cool stuff in. People tend to lean towards fan service and comedy
16-06-2018T23:47:09,unsteddyphoenix,And cooler stuff is harder to draw normally too.
16-06-2018T23:47:45,FenceEqualizer,"True, why I think the Akita picture is one of my favorites"
16-06-2018T23:47:47,unsteddyphoenix,"Not to speak for tom, but i'd be dissuaded from picking a complicated sketch if I had to draw 7 all in one go"
16-06-2018T23:47:54,SpazztasticKiwi,You know something a bit funny happened to me the other day
16-06-2018T23:48:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Not related to this but still
16-06-2018T23:48:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"Bagheera was sprawled out as usual on the bed, I was on my phone"
16-06-2018T23:49:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"I sneezed, he jumped so I jumped so he jumped again and I nearly tossed my phone"
16-06-2018T23:50:15,unsteddyphoenix,thats so...I dont even know what to say to that
16-06-2018T23:50:26,unsteddyphoenix,Youre made for each other
16-06-2018T23:50:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Well the cat surely sticks to the back of my heels well enough
16-06-2018T23:51:20,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-katdryer:
16-06-2018T23:51:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Can‚Äôt even wash my face with the door closed without him pawing under the door to watch
16-06-2018T23:53:16,unsteddyphoenix,how precious~
16-06-2018T23:53:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll sometimes ask him ‚Äúare you cute?‚Äù And lately he‚Äôs been giving me this ‚Äúgetting real sick of that question‚Äù look
16-06-2018T23:54:58,Bgrmystr2,haha
16-06-2018T23:58:21,FenceEqualizer,Are you using baby talk? If you are that's why
16-06-2018T23:58:38,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's not actually good to do
16-06-2018T23:58:48,unsteddyphoenix,I only talk to cats in baby talk
16-06-2018T23:58:58,unsteddyphoenix,I dont know any other way
16-06-2018T23:59:06,Bgrmystr2,ya fucked up then xD cuz animals can learn real words and attach them to things
16-06-2018T23:59:57,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah my cat used to only respond to baby talk after we did that
16-06-2018T23:59:57,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs not baby talk
