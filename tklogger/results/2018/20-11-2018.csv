20-11-2018T00:27:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Niceness. Practice makes perfect
20-11-2018T00:27:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Or at least it gets you closer and closer
20-11-2018T00:29:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom, is catto still on beddo?"
20-11-2018T00:31:05,RimaDraws,well finally found the flora sketch i did
20-11-2018T00:31:12,Twokinds,Yes
20-11-2018T00:31:32,Bgrmystr2,so disappointed.
20-11-2018T00:32:05,Twokinds,I tries to shoo her off but she didn't listen.
20-11-2018T00:33:01,RimaDraws,mine tries to bother me at night when i sleep
20-11-2018T00:34:20,Bgrmystr2,cat so used to getting exactly what it wants and not being bothered xD
20-11-2018T00:34:57,Dadrobit,As is tradition.
20-11-2018T00:35:18,RimaDraws,mhmm
20-11-2018T00:35:36,Bgrmystr2,I don't get the big fuss
20-11-2018T00:36:32,Bgrmystr2,just pick up the fuzzball and put them in their bed. I've done it before.
20-11-2018T00:36:46,RimaDraws,because when you're trying to sleep and the cat won't sit still its hard to sleep
20-11-2018T00:36:58,Bgrmystr2,"well, tom's not trying to sleep so"
20-11-2018T00:37:06,RimaDraws,sorry
20-11-2018T00:37:08,Bgrmystr2,atm that thankfully doesn't apply quite yet
20-11-2018T00:38:00,Bgrmystr2,"it wouldn't bother me any, having something warm and fuzzy in my bed wouldn't kill me overnight"
20-11-2018T00:38:14,Bgrmystr2,but I've never had a problem moving em either
20-11-2018T00:38:25,RimaDraws,my kitty finally sleeps near my feet or close to my chest when he gets comfy
20-11-2018T00:39:26,RimaDraws,right now he's on the couch with me just laying down
20-11-2018T00:40:09,unsteddyphoenix,So cozy~
20-11-2018T00:40:21,Twokinds,She's off! I'm going to take my shot and go to bed
20-11-2018T00:40:23,RimaDraws,he's just purring
20-11-2018T00:40:24,Twokinds,G'night!

20-11-2018T11:12:44,Sifty,to get better at sketching I could use sfm to pose character models and use them to get better at poses and stuff
20-11-2018T11:24:59,Mippy,I can hear the Dumbledore/Grindelwald shippers fangasuming at being thrown a bone

20-11-2018T16:06:18,Twokinds,Five minutes after waking up this morning I stepped on broken glass. That was fun.
20-11-2018T16:06:30,Twokinds,My mother broke something and 'cleaned it up' but didn't quite get it all.
20-11-2018T16:06:34,TerraTheWizard,oh heck

20-11-2018T16:06:44,Twokinds,Then I had to mow the grass with a cut on my heel. Fun.
20-11-2018T16:06:53,Bgrmystr2,was there bleed everywhere?

20-11-2018T16:07:42,Bgrmystr2,okay ;o
20-11-2018T16:08:07,Bgrmystr2,"glass cuts can be super dangerous even if they don't look it, so take care with it"
20-11-2018T16:45:48,CrimsonQuill,Ouch!
20-11-2018T16:46:09,CrimsonQuill,I pnce cut my finger on the glass of a picture frame I was using. It hurt like hell.
20-11-2018T16:46:28,CrimsonQuill,"Just stick on some antiseptic and a plaster, just in case."

20-11-2018T19:42:23,CrRAR,"I was being rambunctious, but that slowed my roll REAL quick."
20-11-2018T19:44:05,RimaDraws,ive had glass at work get into my finger through my gloves. i had to pull out two tiny splinters of glass
20-11-2018T19:44:58,CrRAR,"Yeah, if anything gets stuck, esp glass, it's endless agony."
