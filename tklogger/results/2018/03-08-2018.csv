03-08-2018T00:47:04,TheGamePlayer,No

03-08-2018T00:49:57,TheGamePlayer,I'm going to get some footage and share it in chat
03-08-2018T00:50:04,ZRO4825,=D
03-08-2018T00:50:10,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
03-08-2018T00:50:16,TheGamePlayer,If they allow that in the heli
03-08-2018T00:51:36,ZRO4825,"Probably won't, if I had to take a guess. Is it gonna be open doors, or any idea?"
03-08-2018T00:51:59,Dadrobit,Been in a helicopter once. Was a medical heli though. From Yuma to Phoenix. About $100k. Thank God for insurance....
03-08-2018T00:52:33,ZRO4825,"I'm not sure that counts, Dadro. Can't exactly enjoy the ride in a medi-heli. :P"
03-08-2018T00:52:50,Dadrobit,I was on morphine. I enjoyed it plenty.
03-08-2018T00:53:03,TheGamePlayer,"It's a small heli, very slim, idk if it's doors will be open, only reason I can think of is it would mess with the helicopters ""instruments"""
03-08-2018T00:53:04,ZRO4825,lmao
03-08-2018T00:53:52,TheGamePlayer,XD were you ok?
03-08-2018T00:54:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve been in a plane. I‚Äôll pass on a helicopter
03-08-2018T00:54:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark‚Äôs vid of his helicopter ride made me nauseous
03-08-2018T00:54:51,Bgrmystr2,"haven't been in a helicopter that I remember........ but if I have, whoops"
03-08-2018T00:54:57,Bgrmystr2,I've been in a plane a couple tiems
03-08-2018T00:55:00,Bgrmystr2,no big deal
03-08-2018T00:55:02,Dadrobit,"Ha, fuck no. Broke my damned back in 6 places in a dirt bike accident in Cali. Was going to PHX for a second opinion. First doctor wanted to do ""massive spinal reconstruction surgery""."
03-08-2018T00:55:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Go big or get hospitalized
03-08-2018T00:55:31,Bgrmystr2,that sounds
03-08-2018T00:55:35,Bgrmystr2,rather scary
03-08-2018T00:55:44,Bgrmystr2,and not-very-successful
03-08-2018T00:55:45,Dadrobit,"Second doctor said, ""fuck it, put him in a plastic shell for a couple months""."
03-08-2018T00:55:53,Dadrobit,So we went with the second one.
03-08-2018T00:56:02,Bgrmystr2,how's your back doin since then?
03-08-2018T00:56:12,TheGamePlayer,Ouch
03-08-2018T00:56:48,Dadrobit,"Eh, it sucks. But I work out, do physical therapy, and go to a chiropractor for immediate relief."
03-08-2018T00:56:59,Dadrobit,It manages the pain pretty well.
03-08-2018T00:57:16,Dadrobit,"And for everything else, there's medical herb."
03-08-2018T00:57:23,ZRO4825,Chiropractors are amazing at times. &lt;3
03-08-2018T00:57:27,TheGamePlayer,Need coffee brb
03-08-2018T00:57:27,Bgrmystr2,do you think the surgery would have been a better choice? ignoring the costs?
03-08-2018T00:57:28,ZRO4825,I need to go see mine. @.@
03-08-2018T00:57:36,SpazztasticKiwi,üçÅ
03-08-2018T00:58:08,TheGamePlayer,Canada?
03-08-2018T00:58:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I know it‚Äôs not a weed leaf. There‚Äôs not an emoji for that
03-08-2018T00:58:24,TheGamePlayer,XD
03-08-2018T00:58:36,Bgrmystr2,you can't copy/paste stuff in this chat anymore
03-08-2018T00:58:37,Bgrmystr2,RIP
03-08-2018T00:58:39,Bgrmystr2,Dx
03-08-2018T00:58:44,Dadrobit,It's a toss up. The first doctor was very negative about the prognosis overall. Dude even thought I was faking when I assured him that I could still feel my legs.
03-08-2018T00:59:04,Bgrmystr2,did he even bother to do xrays
03-08-2018T00:59:13,Bgrmystr2,"that shit don't lie, yo"
03-08-2018T00:59:23,Dadrobit,"Yeah, that's what made him think I was faking. My spine was fucked up."
03-08-2018T00:59:23,TheGamePlayer,Sage may I share a link to an art piece I'm working on?
03-08-2018T01:00:02,Dadrobit,My T5 in particular looked like it was completely crushed.
03-08-2018T01:00:25,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: next time maybe don't do that.
03-08-2018T01:00:27,Dadrobit,"T3-T8 all had compression fractures, but that one was super bad."
03-08-2018T01:00:35,Dadrobit,"Yeah, thanks."
03-08-2018T01:00:46,SageSaga,brb gonna start fixing dinner
03-08-2018T01:00:50,Bgrmystr2,just put a mental post-it note

03-08-2018T01:01:02,Bgrmystr2,"just for next time, dadro lol"

03-08-2018T01:01:12,Bgrmystr2,just prepare for the future
03-08-2018T01:01:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I know this is unrelated but anyone else realize the National flag emojis are in alphabetical order
03-08-2018T01:01:27,Bgrmystr2,"why would it not be, Kiwi?"
03-08-2018T01:01:37,SpazztasticKiwi,But the rainbow flag is in the front
03-08-2018T01:01:48,TheGamePlayer,Lol
03-08-2018T01:01:59,TheGamePlayer,Where should it be?
03-08-2018T01:02:00,Bgrmystr2,:flag_ac: This is the first one
03-08-2018T01:02:03,Bgrmystr2,so no it's not?
03-08-2018T01:02:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve never had reason to study the hundreds of emojis I have
03-08-2018T01:02:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"If it‚Äôs Rainbow flag, it should be in the R section"
03-08-2018T01:03:46,TheGamePlayer,"My dog hidding under my house, people are shooting off fireworks at 1:03 in the morning"
03-08-2018T01:04:17,Bgrmystr2,I don't see the flag in the flag section at all Kiwi
03-08-2018T01:04:24,Bgrmystr2,I'm not sure what you're even looking at
03-08-2018T01:04:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I got an Apple
03-08-2018T01:04:39,TheGamePlayer,"There's many names for the rainbow flag so they where like, fuck it lets put it here"

03-08-2018T01:05:12,Dadrobit,"Also, they put weed in damned near everything now, its kinda cool. Got a bottle of ""Mary's Medicinals Muscle Coolant"". Because why the hell not?"
03-08-2018T01:05:13,TheGamePlayer,Let me check Droid
03-08-2018T01:05:23,unsteddyphoenix,Weird~

03-08-2018T01:21:17,unsteddyphoenix,ghosting your stream
03-08-2018T01:21:30,Bgrmystr2,lol trying to make the stream work and failing
03-08-2018T01:21:34,TheGamePlayer,"Cause I like to chat, and I want to watch but I cant, phones don't run this app well"
03-08-2018T01:21:46,ZRO4825,"Ahhh, yes, the Picarto app...."
03-08-2018T01:21:57,Mihari,"Yah know, I hear that all the time, but I never have had a problem with it."
03-08-2018T01:22:03,Ordithus,My S5 does well with the app
03-08-2018T01:22:05,TheGamePlayer,Plus it's a crap phone that was dumped in hydraulic oil
03-08-2018T01:22:21,Bgrmystr2,"cuz all phones are the same, mihari :v"
03-08-2018T01:22:28,ZRO4825,"My iPhone doesn't do well with it unless I'm getting like, PERFECT signal. And even then it's kinda hit and miss."
03-08-2018T01:22:35,TheGamePlayer,And my internet is awful
03-08-2018T01:22:41,Mihari,"Yes, but if there was something fundamentally wrong with the app, then it would be constant."
03-08-2018T01:22:54,TheGamePlayer,Is that enough or shall I go on?
03-08-2018T01:22:59,Ordithus,Sometimes you just have a bad signal
03-08-2018T01:23:00,ZRO4825,"Sage, middle panels. Her web is kinda incomplete~ Unless that's on purpose."
03-08-2018T01:23:05,unsteddyphoenix,I think mostly people's wifi isnt good enough
03-08-2018T01:23:37,TheGamePlayer,I'd love to watch Sage but instead I'll cheer you on in chat
03-08-2018T01:24:08,Ordithus,One of these days Kaylin is going to find a spider in there
03-08-2018T01:24:21,Bgrmystr2,xD
03-08-2018T01:24:27,Dadrobit,"Only problem I have with the app nowadays is that when you minimize it, if you don't open it again for a few minutes, it just crashes and you have to re-open it from the start."
03-08-2018T01:24:35,SageSaga,i still havent shown what the armor does XD
03-08-2018T01:24:50,ZRO4825,"Knowing Kaylin? She'd just be like ""Oh, hi. No, you can't stay in there, that'll give people the wrong impression."" lol"
03-08-2018T01:25:07,Bgrmystr2,"right, zro xD"
03-08-2018T01:25:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm off to üõå. Work tomorrow and they extended my hours

03-08-2018T01:26:07,Ordithus,Cool Sage!
03-08-2018T01:26:14,Dadrobit,o/ Spazz
03-08-2018T01:26:14,SageSaga,calling someone Spazz feels kinda insulting
03-08-2018T01:26:21,Bgrmystr2,gnight kiwi
03-08-2018T01:26:25,Ordithus,Hence why we call her Kiwi
03-08-2018T01:26:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Trust me I am a spazz
03-08-2018T01:26:28,SageSaga,might have to stick with Kiwi
03-08-2018T01:26:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt care what you call me as long as it‚Äôs not late for dinner
03-08-2018T01:27:00,ZRO4825,lol
03-08-2018T01:27:09,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-ohmy:
03-08-2018T01:27:15,Ordithus,:ptv-snicker:
03-08-2018T01:27:18,TheGamePlayer,Now Sage has 975 followers
03-08-2018T01:27:23,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah. Im fine with spazz.
03-08-2018T01:27:30,Dadrobit,Closing in on 1k
03-08-2018T01:27:35,unsteddyphoenix,ooo~
03-08-2018T01:27:44,Dadrobit,Sage is getting popular
03-08-2018T01:27:56,Ordithus,I don't remember a subscribe option for Sage...
03-08-2018T01:27:58,SageSaga,one of these days i'll be a real artist...
03-08-2018T01:28:02,TheGamePlayer,More people need to follow
03-08-2018T01:28:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Hope you bring the computer back from the dead Tom. Nite everyone
03-08-2018T01:28:07,Dadrobit,"Try to remember us little guys when you get there, Sage! :D"
03-08-2018T01:28:12,Bgrmystr2,gnight
03-08-2018T01:28:22,TheGamePlayer,You are a real artist Sage
03-08-2018T01:28:28,SageSaga,i want Tom's computer to die
03-08-2018T01:28:36,TheGamePlayer,XD
03-08-2018T01:28:36,SageSaga,and force him to get a better one
03-08-2018T01:28:36,Ordithus,:ptv-confused:
03-08-2018T01:28:39,unsteddyphoenix,:OO
03-08-2018T01:28:40,Bgrmystr2,how mean
03-08-2018T01:28:40,Dadrobit,Less competition.
03-08-2018T01:28:44,unsteddyphoenix,Put out a hit on the pc
03-08-2018T01:28:49,SageSaga,he's got everything backed up!
03-08-2018T01:28:51,ZRO4825,"Actually, I can kinda see where Sage is comin from there. :P"
03-08-2018T01:29:05,Bgrmystr2,I stand by my statement &gt;:T
03-08-2018T01:29:09,TheGamePlayer,@SageSaga may I show you art I made?
03-08-2018T01:29:20,SageSaga,sure?
03-08-2018T01:29:26,TheGamePlayer,Ok
03-08-2018T01:30:33,SageSaga,Tom's PC is almost 5 years old and giving him issues that are hard to pin down- if a reformat/refresh doesnt fix it- its probably hardware and any hardware is pretty much going to call for a whole new system
03-08-2018T01:30:42,Ordithus,Ah
03-08-2018T01:31:02,Bgrmystr2,"eh, can't be that bad"
03-08-2018T01:31:05,unsteddyphoenix,Not...NESSESARILY
03-08-2018T01:31:12,unsteddyphoenix,Ive only had to replace a GPU before.
03-08-2018T01:31:25,Bgrmystr2,my compuer is 10 years old and I could basically replace my mobo/cpu and still be good
03-08-2018T01:31:29,Ordithus,Parts of my PC are from 2011... though a lot is from this year
03-08-2018T01:31:37,SageSaga,the issues hes having are probably not caused by the video card
03-08-2018T01:31:49,ZRO4825,"I'm surprised mine hasn't crapped out yet honestly, but yeah, if it goes, mobo/cpu/RAM should be all I need to fix. Rest of it's been replaced piece by piece over time, lol"
03-08-2018T01:31:50,SageSaga,video card is like last on the list of suspects
03-08-2018T01:31:56,TheGamePlayer,https://imgur.com/a/U2JpuqB
03-08-2018T01:32:01,TheGamePlayer,There ya go
03-08-2018T01:32:16,SageSaga,Rebel scum
03-08-2018T01:32:17,unsteddyphoenix,"Right, but it could just be one thing to replace"
03-08-2018T01:32:21,unsteddyphoenix,is what im saying
03-08-2018T01:32:38,TheGamePlayer,Lol it's a work in progress.
03-08-2018T01:33:00,SageSaga,are you doing art just for fun or do you want to make something of it?
03-08-2018T01:33:08,TheGamePlayer,Both
03-08-2018T01:33:20,SageSaga,any particular focus?
03-08-2018T01:33:25,TheGamePlayer,Sometimes I get bored others
03-08-2018T01:34:06,TheGamePlayer,"No not really, I just started that's like my 5th drawing, all free hand too"
03-08-2018T01:34:13,SageSaga,if you want to do character design and such i highly recommend practicing gestural sketching and blocking out parts to refine into a person
03-08-2018T01:34:34,TheGamePlayer,"Ok, thanks"
03-08-2018T01:34:42,SageSaga,by practicing that early you will be able to learn a lot more and faster
03-08-2018T01:34:55,unsteddyphoenix,Blocking out parts?
03-08-2018T01:34:57,TheGamePlayer,Cool
03-08-2018T01:35:00,SageSaga,also take time to learn perspective- i still struggle with it and its hard to learn now that my brain is a rock
03-08-2018T01:35:28,SageSaga,blocking out parts is where you use basic shapes to represent parts of a body
03-08-2018T01:35:28,TheGamePlayer,Lol I'd say your looks great
03-08-2018T01:35:47,TheGamePlayer,Oh interesting
03-08-2018T01:35:47,unsteddyphoenix,Ohhh right.
03-08-2018T01:36:16,unsteddyphoenix,Like how I still use vaguel rectangles to draw hands 'cause I havent bothered learning that yet
03-08-2018T01:36:20,SageSaga,if you practice drawing shapes that fit certain areas you can then refine them and your art will be more dynamic and interesting
03-08-2018T01:37:31,SageSaga,people who learn these things early in their work are able to generally expand much faster once they grasp them
03-08-2018T01:37:52,SageSaga,also makes your work more constant and allows you to replicate your character designs
03-08-2018T01:38:23,SageSaga,"oh - and NEVER use the excuse ""That's just my style"""
03-08-2018T01:38:25,TheGamePlayer,Neeto
03-08-2018T01:38:28,unsteddyphoenix,"I see, I think that's what ive been doing, so that's good."
03-08-2018T01:38:41,unsteddyphoenix,Though I havent really put any focus into learning perspective
03-08-2018T01:38:51,SageSaga,you dont get to have a style till you can do the basics!
03-08-2018T01:39:17,SageSaga,so many people come up with some weird thing they do and they think its a style- but it's really just bad art
03-08-2018T01:39:33,TheGamePlayer,"What amazes me is I drew that in ten minutes, I looked at my helmet for a minute and was able to draw it, without guidelines or anything."
03-08-2018T01:40:46,TheGamePlayer,Then I went over it with pen so the pencil doesn't fade off the page
03-08-2018T01:40:57,SageSaga,guidelines are your friend
03-08-2018T01:41:03,SageSaga,dont abandon them
03-08-2018T01:41:22,TheGamePlayer,I know just sometimes I don't need em
03-08-2018T01:41:48,TheGamePlayer,I need to do more art lessons though that's my main problem
03-08-2018T01:41:49,SageSaga,"it's a classic trick for an artist to ""not use guidelines"" but it's just a trick - a show"
03-08-2018T01:42:28,SageSaga,its something you might do to show off how you can draw- but its a terrible habit and will bite you in the butt later
03-08-2018T01:42:47,TheGamePlayer,Ya I here ya
03-08-2018T01:43:17,TheGamePlayer,"I don't like to take my time, that's my killer"
03-08-2018T01:44:15,SageSaga,brb
03-08-2018T01:46:21,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, being able to draw faster is a good thing"
03-08-2018T01:46:38,Bgrmystr2,drawing faster means you get better that much faster
03-08-2018T01:47:21,Ordithus,Draw all the things! :ptv-angry:
03-08-2018T01:48:04,SageSaga,not if the reason you are able to draw faster is you are skipping important things you should learn
03-08-2018T01:48:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,All of them
03-08-2018T01:48:10,unsteddyphoenix,multi-paper drawing
03-08-2018T01:48:13,unsteddyphoenix,dejavu~
03-08-2018T01:49:11,Bgrmystr2,Friend of mine does speed drawing for gestures so he can quickly sketch out poses in a fraction of the time he used to
03-08-2018T01:49:41,Ordithus,"haha Sage, this sketch"
03-08-2018T01:49:41,TheGamePlayer,Ya I'm talking about needing to slow down and learn ways to draw
03-08-2018T01:49:47,SageSaga,"thats a learned thing though- if you think you are just ""fast at drawing"" it doesnt make you good or better"
03-08-2018T01:50:14,Bgrmystr2,"from what I've been told, you learn getting better, you don't learn speed"
03-08-2018T01:50:43,ZRO4825,^ so much this.
03-08-2018T01:50:50,ZRO4825,"And not just a thing to apply to art, either."
03-08-2018T01:50:51,SageSaga,once you are better at doing something you can do it faster
03-08-2018T01:51:24,Bgrmystr2,even fluff has stated that he entirely regrets going for quality over speed
03-08-2018T01:52:00,ZRO4825,:csagesaga-c3:
03-08-2018T01:52:10,Bgrmystr2,zro is now a subscriber lolo
03-08-2018T01:52:12,TheGamePlayer,"Ya I can draw fast but it's sloppy and not that good, if I take my time it's still sloppy but better, because I do it slowly and learn from my mistakes"
03-08-2018T01:52:21,SageSaga,Fluff can do it he just doesnt think its done till he goes the full yard
03-08-2018T01:52:25,ZRO4825,:csagesaga-nynasmirk:

03-08-2018T01:57:45,SageSaga,if i can ever manage to make a Nyna one i will replace it with that
03-08-2018T01:57:47,ZRO4825,"I'm with ya there, Dadro. I think I could get a lot better if I'd just quit slacking off and actually draw."
03-08-2018T01:57:50,Dadrobit,"Used to be real good about practicing after I quit my job and had a fair amount of free time, now I only hit up the sketch pad like once every 2-3 weeks."
03-08-2018T01:57:54,ZRO4825,"I was just gonna suggest that, Sage, lol"

03-08-2018T02:04:56,sunblaze,"I do have an idea, but I still need to figure out who the most agile of your chars is :D"
03-08-2018T02:05:54,unsteddyphoenix,highest DEX character?
03-08-2018T02:06:14,SageSaga,Tough between Kaylin and Nyna unless boobs get in the way- if so - Nyna
03-08-2018T02:06:49,Ordithus,Not one of the combat robo girls?
03-08-2018T02:07:01,sunblaze,^yeah I would have thought that as well
03-08-2018T02:07:19,sunblaze,or all build for strenghth and endurance?
03-08-2018T02:07:38,SageSaga,Lien is pretty flexible but they arent made to do impossible stuff like their arms bent backwards and such
03-08-2018T02:07:42,SageSaga,so they still have limits
03-08-2018T02:09:51,ZRO4825,"Yeah, the android girls are all supposed to be pretty much human, iirc"
03-08-2018T02:10:14,sunblaze,nah I am in the mood for robot girls today
03-08-2018T02:10:33,sunblaze,cool. then I'd like a belly-dancing Lien. make it a really difficult pose please :D
03-08-2018T02:11:18,Ordithus,:ptv-ohmy:
03-08-2018T02:11:25,SageSaga,=_= why do you want specifically a difficult pose?!
03-08-2018T02:11:42,sunblaze,because easy is what everyone can do
03-08-2018T02:11:54,sunblaze,but to be honest it does not relaly matter as long as it looks neat
03-08-2018T02:12:10,unsteddyphoenix,not a bad point lmao
03-08-2018T02:12:25,Ordithus,haha
03-08-2018T02:12:25,unsteddyphoenix,What's a difficult belly dancing pose
03-08-2018T02:12:41,MatyMaty,ankles behind neck?
03-08-2018T02:12:58,SageSaga,is- is that a belly dancing pose?
03-08-2018T02:13:03,ZRO4825,Sounds more like Yoga
03-08-2018T02:13:05,sunblaze,that sounds more like ballet instead of belly dancing
03-08-2018T02:13:08,unsteddyphoenix,Advanced belly dancing
03-08-2018T02:13:20,sunblaze,very advanced :D

03-08-2018T02:14:22,TheGamePlayer,"So ya Sage im trying to do the object thingy, so far it's helping quite abit iv got the chest piece done and now I'm working on the arms"
03-08-2018T02:14:31,Ordithus,"Gonna catch some z's, goodnight :ptv-sleepy:"

03-08-2018T02:16:46,Dadrobit,o/ Ord
03-08-2018T02:17:44,TheGamePlayer,"OMG 2:16am I better go, thanks so much for the suggestions Sage have a great night everyone!!!"
03-08-2018T02:17:59,ZRO4825,G'night TGP~
03-08-2018T02:18:07,SageSaga,take care
03-08-2018T02:18:13,sunblaze,game ehhh sleep well!
03-08-2018T02:19:27,Dadrobit,o/
03-08-2018T02:20:10,Dadrobit,"Oof, went and found the sketchbook, immediately reminded of why I quit my last session."
03-08-2018T02:20:26,unsteddyphoenix,practise makes practise as they say
03-08-2018T02:20:30,Dadrobit,I was straight up tilted.
03-08-2018T02:20:39,ZRO4825,"Now THAT is a feeling I can understand. I always try to go back to something, and it's like, every bit of frustration with it is just RIGHT back in your face."
03-08-2018T02:21:08,Dadrobit,The scribbling out of the hands was real. Permission to post my embarrassment?
03-08-2018T02:22:45,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
03-08-2018T02:23:24,ZRO4825,"I know it's just years of practice, but I have so much envy of Sage's line work. I can get good lines, but it takes me like, 9 or 10 tries at least sometimes (if not more) to get a line the way I want it, lol"
03-08-2018T02:25:08,ZRO4825,"Also, Sage, gotta admit, when I suggested this, I was imagining some sort of embarassment over the no-panties thing. Didn't expect the cosplay angle. :joy:"
03-08-2018T02:25:43,Dadrobit,"Yeah, that's my motivation to keep going tbh. Whether or not I like it, 5 years is going to pass. And in 5 years, either I'm going to be someone with 5 more years of art practice under my belt, or I'm going to be somoene who wishes they had 5 extra years"
03-08-2018T02:25:56,Dadrobit,of art practice.
03-08-2018T02:26:05,ZRO4825,Excellent way to look at it.
03-08-2018T02:26:33,unsteddyphoenix,"Ironically, I wanted to try art 5  years ago"
03-08-2018T02:26:49,unsteddyphoenix,Can confirm this logic
03-08-2018T02:27:27,Dadrobit,"Right now, I'm a dude with almost a year of almost decent practice."
03-08-2018T02:27:38,Dadrobit,My art almost reflects that.
03-08-2018T02:28:00,ZRO4825,"I'm a guy with a lot of talk, and very little actual practice to back it up. :P"
03-08-2018T02:28:14,MatyMaty,damn
03-08-2018T02:28:18,SageSaga,uhhhhhggg
03-08-2018T02:28:25,unsteddyphoenix,lol
03-08-2018T02:28:27,SageSaga,look at dat tiny hand
03-08-2018T02:28:31,MatyMaty,Nyna's outfit really compliments Kaylin's bust :P
03-08-2018T02:28:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,its danty
03-08-2018T02:28:40,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe the boobs are just
03-08-2018T02:28:43,unsteddyphoenix,So big
03-08-2018T02:28:44,SageSaga,this is not Kaylin
03-08-2018T02:28:47,unsteddyphoenix,It makes the hand look small
03-08-2018T02:28:50,sunblaze,does not matter sage. noone looks at that hand
03-08-2018T02:28:52,Dadrobit,"I have the same problem, but the hands are fucking mammoth."
03-08-2018T02:28:55,sunblaze,boobs to distracting
03-08-2018T02:28:58,MatyMaty,Relm?
03-08-2018T02:29:06,MatyMaty,I can't see well in the phone XO

03-08-2018T02:29:27,MatyMaty,yeah XD
03-08-2018T02:29:27,Bgrmystr2,"the hand looks a bit too small, I think"
03-08-2018T02:29:32,MatyMaty,now I see the whole pic
03-08-2018T02:29:37,SageSaga,the hand is much too small
03-08-2018T02:29:42,Bgrmystr2,xD
03-08-2018T02:29:47,ZRO4825,"and yeah, gotta agree with Sage there. :x"
03-08-2018T02:29:52,MatyMaty,"also, Toyoko is Zro's fav IIRC"

03-08-2018T02:31:14,MatyMaty,"ugh I should stop watching sovereign citizen videos,"
03-08-2018T02:31:22,MatyMaty,They are too addictive
03-08-2018T02:31:29,SageSaga,BONGHONGAGAHOOGANGAHS?!
03-08-2018T02:31:44,Dadrobit,Those videos just end up upsetting me tbh
03-08-2018T02:31:52,SageSaga,I get your reference Bgr
03-08-2018T02:32:02,Dadrobit,"Like, fuck, those people are real. They're actually sharing the planet with me...."
03-08-2018T02:32:15,MatyMaty,well they usually get tazed :P
03-08-2018T02:32:36,MatyMaty,but i guess that happens when you say you are gonna arrest a judge in the courtroom
03-08-2018T02:33:02,Dadrobit,"It's not so bad, the books aren't so expensive, and it's not like I'm going through them once a month or anything lol."
03-08-2018T02:33:05,Bgrmystr2,hahaha sage
03-08-2018T02:33:09,Dadrobit,Whisper fail
03-08-2018T02:33:10,Bgrmystr2,that video was amazing
03-08-2018T02:33:14,Dadrobit,I'm bad at Picarto
03-08-2018T02:33:31,MatyMaty,there you go
03-08-2018T02:33:34,ZRO4825,Personally I think Picarto's chat system isn't exactly great either. :P
03-08-2018T02:33:56,MatyMaty,it isn't the best thing to use :P
03-08-2018T02:34:30,sunblaze,great is great. picarto is just... picarto
03-08-2018T02:34:34,MatyMaty,"a few streams ago someone posted in public their ERP they were doing in whispers, lol"
03-08-2018T02:34:36,MatyMaty,at Chalo's
03-08-2018T02:34:40,ZRO4825,lmao
03-08-2018T02:34:44,Dadrobit,GG no RE
03-08-2018T02:34:58,ZRO4825,"Why would you even DO that in PICARTO of all places? Get thine horny self to Discord, FFS XD"
03-08-2018T02:35:18,MatyMaty,I don't know! XD but it was kinda hilarious

03-08-2018T02:35:38,Dadrobit,Please tell me it was an off the wall kink?

03-08-2018T02:35:47,SageSaga,"""No seriously-"" ""Oh crap!"""
03-08-2018T02:36:25,MatyMaty,"they were like ""OH GOD please delete that!!!"""
03-08-2018T02:36:31,Bgrmystr2,the whisper system doesn't even work half the time xD
03-08-2018T02:36:40,Bgrmystr2,I dunno what it is
03-08-2018T02:36:51,SageSaga,that why when I do sex RP i use a code- it's all chess moves
03-08-2018T02:36:58,Bgrmystr2,"and then that person was like ""Take a screenshot of it next time it happens"" and I'm just thinkin"
03-08-2018T02:37:06,Bgrmystr2,how exactly.. do I take a screenshot of that
03-08-2018T02:37:17,ZRO4825,"I remember stumbling across people doing stuff like that in Final Fantasy XI, when they thought they'd found an out-of-the-way corner. Walk by and get some rather racy if not explicit emotes, lmao"
03-08-2018T02:37:24,SageSaga,"Rook to A4 - My, what a naughty little pawn you are"
03-08-2018T02:37:25,ZRO4825,"Or the times they'd mistell into an LS...oh MY those times, lmao"
03-08-2018T02:37:28,MatyMaty,lol
03-08-2018T02:37:35,Bgrmystr2,You do the /whisper person name.. then it just ignores the /whisper and goes to all chat and nothing happens xD I dunno
03-08-2018T02:37:40,Dadrobit,"""Rook to Pawn 6"" ""Ohhh~ You dirty minx~"""
03-08-2018T02:37:48,MatyMaty,use the whisper tab :P
03-08-2018T02:38:22,Bgrmystr2,you mean the thing that doesn't work?
03-08-2018T02:38:36,ZRO4825,"Works for me when I remember it exists, lol"
03-08-2018T02:38:37,Bgrmystr2,"Last time I tried that, no matter which half of the chat box was selected, it went to all chat"
03-08-2018T02:38:41,Dadrobit,"Ay, Sage, mind giving me some useful and/or scathing critique?"
03-08-2018T02:39:01,ZRO4825,\[T]/
03-08-2018T02:39:05,MatyMaty,useful and scathing?
03-08-2018T02:39:07,SageSaga,i dont do scathing critiques anymore
03-08-2018T02:39:20,Dadrobit,What a loss
03-08-2018T02:39:27,SageSaga,they are not helpful
03-08-2018T02:39:46,SageSaga,i havent done those since i was active on DA
03-08-2018T02:39:52,MatyMaty,"I had someone ask me for critique a while back. I said what I thought was wrong, mostly with their proportions"
03-08-2018T02:40:01,MatyMaty,"and I got a ""sorry but that's my style"" reply"
03-08-2018T02:40:04,MatyMaty,so yeah
03-08-2018T02:40:15,Mihari,I don't like giving critiques anymore either.
03-08-2018T02:40:19,Dadrobit,"My current style is ""Less than great"""
03-08-2018T02:40:41,MatyMaty,"There are two kinds of ""style"""
03-08-2018T02:40:51,ZRO4825,Style doesn't excuse incorrect proportions!
03-08-2018T02:41:03,MatyMaty,one is the way you draw that makes people recognize your stuff even if it might not be the best
03-08-2018T02:41:12,SageSaga,i will give critiques- just not scathing ones
03-08-2018T02:41:13,MatyMaty,but that is not something that is done in purpose
03-08-2018T02:41:42,MatyMaty,and the style that artists develop when they know all the basics and can tweak them at will
03-08-2018T02:41:57,SageSaga,but - people who use style as an excuse for bad art are worse than scum
03-08-2018T02:41:58,Mihari,"I give them if specifically asked, but otherwise..."
03-08-2018T02:42:21,MatyMaty,just because someone has a very recognizable style it doesn't mean it is always good
03-08-2018T02:42:28,ZRO4825,"My current style is ""Awww hell this looks like crap"" :rofl:"
03-08-2018T02:42:34,Dadrobit,This is the last one I worked on. Ended up giving up on it. Just wasn't happy with how it was coming out.
03-08-2018T02:42:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Same Zro

03-08-2018T02:42:51,Dadrobit,Censored for the kids
03-08-2018T02:43:06,MatyMaty,mmmmm
03-08-2018T02:43:17,Dadrobit,"#2 Pencil, useful for all sorts of things"
03-08-2018T02:43:17,MatyMaty,"I can see what you are going for, Dadrobit"
03-08-2018T02:43:36,MatyMaty,"but, mind if I tell you what I think?"
03-08-2018T02:43:43,Dadrobit,"Yeah, go for it"
03-08-2018T02:44:05,Dadrobit,"I'm in need of help, not looking for compliments lol."
03-08-2018T02:44:16,MatyMaty,are you using a ref for the pose?
03-08-2018T02:44:58,Dadrobit,"Yes, was trying to block it out and do everything all proper like, but once I got past a point, i was just tilted at it not coming out."
03-08-2018T02:45:16,Bgrmystr2,"""censored for the kids"" Who even is here that applies to?"
03-08-2018T02:45:40,MatyMaty,that's kinda the thing. It feels you are eyeballing the pose but not really thinking of the figure in parts. Or blocks.
03-08-2018T02:46:09,MatyMaty,so as you draw the proportions begin to go off
03-08-2018T02:46:17,Dadrobit,My rectangles and triangles are not powerful enough!
03-08-2018T02:46:38,MatyMaty,Think in boxes and cilinders
03-08-2018T02:46:45,MatyMaty,never in flat figures :P
03-08-2018T02:47:01,Dadrobit,There's... There's a THIRD dimension?
03-08-2018T02:47:29,MatyMaty,"also, I see you don't have many construction lines"
03-08-2018T02:47:50,MatyMaty,try to use them more even if the sketch is messy
03-08-2018T02:49:19,MatyMaty,that's my two cents :P Now if Sage wants to suggest something
03-08-2018T02:49:29,Dadrobit,Thank you kindly
03-08-2018T02:50:20,MatyMaty,"also if you can, I suggest moving to digital"
03-08-2018T02:50:48,MatyMaty,in the long term the cost of a cheap tablet is much smaller of what you will spend in art paper and supplies
03-08-2018T02:51:08,SageSaga,with that style of drawing i recommend doing a line of action even if you are using a reference and keep it in mind
03-08-2018T02:51:58,Dadrobit,"That's a bugger for me. I like using paper. And with digital, there are so many options that are like ""Okay, it's inexpensive, but is it cheap?"""
03-08-2018T02:52:06,SageSaga,if you are just doing gestural work then dont spend too much time in one space just keep the flow going
03-08-2018T02:52:30,MatyMaty,paper is nice. But learning is not just about what one likes :P
03-08-2018T02:52:32,SageSaga,i wouldnt recommend digital unless you are trying to go into it professionally
03-08-2018T02:52:51,ZRO4825,"I'm using a Wacom Intuos Comic. Less than $100, and it works pretty well. At least it seems to for me."
03-08-2018T02:53:09,SageSaga,if your goal is to make it a profession or a big hobby of yours- digital is fantastic especially if you want to work in color
03-08-2018T02:53:09,Dadrobit,"Also, Sage, I did try using a line of action. That's the one curving down her chest and abdomen into her right leg. I tried blocking it out from that."
03-08-2018T02:53:17,MatyMaty,Huion/Ugee/Star tablets are like 50
03-08-2018T02:53:27,MatyMaty,and they are pretty decent
03-08-2018T02:53:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Huion for the win tbh
03-08-2018T02:53:34,SageSaga,it looks very stiff for having a line of action- unless its a straight line
03-08-2018T02:54:44,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it was a gentle curve below the neck, but that's what I felt the model had going."
03-08-2018T02:54:59,Dadrobit,Perhaps a more aggressive take on it?
03-08-2018T02:55:48,Dadrobit,"The arms were doing something wild in front of her face, but I felt the body as a whole was not particularly dynamic."
03-08-2018T02:55:54,SageSaga,honestly - i dont feel comfortable saying too much only seeing one sketch
03-08-2018T02:57:51,SageSaga,Maty covered a lot too though and i dont think it's right for me to just repeat her
03-08-2018T03:04:47,MatyMaty,:)
03-08-2018T03:05:20,MatyMaty,"alas, is time to hit the hay"

03-08-2018T03:29:58,ZRO4825,Didn't we have one with Reiko wearing it too?
03-08-2018T03:30:17,SageSaga,i think so
03-08-2018T03:30:47,ZRO4825,":thinking: I'm gonna have to try and remember to comb through Patreon at some point and check, lol"
03-08-2018T03:30:48,SageSaga,Nami
03-08-2018T03:30:52,ZRO4825,"Ahh, right"

03-08-2018T03:31:10,ZRO4825,I feel like we've had Kaylin wearing it at some point too.
03-08-2018T03:31:25,ZRO4825,"But that one's coming up as ""maybe I'm just wishful thinking"" in my memory too."
03-08-2018T03:31:50,Bgrmystr2,"Sage, are you gonna make it the Tokyo big sight?"
03-08-2018T03:32:00,Bgrmystr2,or some random building
03-08-2018T03:32:05,ZRO4825,Her name's Toyoko and she's always a big sight. :V

03-08-2018T03:33:27,ZRO4825,"I can't help but laugh at that one, lol"
03-08-2018T03:33:29,Bgrmystr2,"Zro, you'll take my +1 and go to the corner where you belong :u"
03-08-2018T03:33:49,ZRO4825,"Well as long as I get a +1 for it, the corner's okay for a little while."
03-08-2018T03:33:59,Bgrmystr2,:)
03-08-2018T03:34:09,Bgrmystr2,She's very unhappy sage lol
03-08-2018T03:34:20,ZRO4825,It's always so warm though. It's like the corner is always 90 degrees. D:

03-08-2018T03:40:19,SageSaga,i dont see a Kaylin or Rieko
03-08-2018T03:40:47,ZRO4825,"I did see Reiko, it wasn't actually Nyna's yukata, it was a matching one in her own colors with Nyna in the picture."
03-08-2018T03:41:16,SageSaga,yeah that doesnt count
03-08-2018T03:41:25,ZRO4825,"Yeah, I realized that too after I found it~ lol"
03-08-2018T03:45:07,ZRO4825,"Seriously though, how have NONE of us requested Kaylin in Nyna's outfit yet? :joy:"
03-08-2018T03:46:26,ZRO4825,"I'm trying to think of what to do for November. Toyoko for sure, something to do with birthday. Did cake last year, but this year it'll be in color, so not sure if want cake again, or something different. o_o"

03-08-2018T12:45:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I pop in this morning and the first and only thing to catch my eye is that boob emote

03-08-2018T12:48:53,Ordithus,"Even with help, Flora just can't quite compete with... that."
03-08-2018T12:49:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Sage knows the art of the jiggle
03-08-2018T12:53:30,TheGamePlayer,Lol
03-08-2018T12:53:37,TheGamePlayer,Morning
03-08-2018T13:40:13,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, flora's more of a juggle. Sage's is more of a bounce"
03-08-2018T13:40:18,Bgrmystr2,the two are different
03-08-2018T13:43:32,Bgrmystr2,"jiggle* please fingers, come on"
03-08-2018T13:56:46,Bgrmystr2,hay sage :D

03-08-2018T14:01:07,ZoieFalcona,Hey Lann... and take care of yourself Sage

03-08-2018T14:02:42,Tharkis,:ctharkis-earwiggle:
03-08-2018T14:03:04,SageSaga,hey Sun hey Thark
03-08-2018T14:11:49,Twokinds,Morning
03-08-2018T14:12:13,iliar,"Good Morning, Tom!"
03-08-2018T14:12:30,SageSaga,yo Tom
03-08-2018T14:12:35,sunblaze,hi
03-08-2018T14:12:35,Bgrmystr2,morning tom
03-08-2018T14:12:37,Twokinds,I am on a different computer.
03-08-2018T14:12:55,Twokinds,My work PC is undergoing a memory test and will be for the next 4 hours.
03-08-2018T14:13:06,LannAF,hope it works tom
03-08-2018T14:13:16,SageSaga,=_= Lann
03-08-2018T14:13:24,LannAF,er
03-08-2018T14:13:26,LannAF,lol
03-08-2018T14:13:29,LannAF,you know what I mean
03-08-2018T14:13:36,LannAF,I'm still half awake man don't judge me
03-08-2018T14:13:44,sunblaze,judges
03-08-2018T14:13:49,SageSaga,i dont know what you mean because that doesnt work either way
03-08-2018T14:14:05,LannAF,I hope it ends up being something he can find out
03-08-2018T14:14:07,Mihari,"Ah, see why I suggested doing it overnight, Tom? XD"
03-08-2018T14:14:16,LannAF,Buying new memory is much less expensive than a whole new computer.
03-08-2018T14:14:24,Mihari,Kinda...
03-08-2018T14:14:27,LannAF,...yeah...
03-08-2018T14:14:36,LannAF,"I mean, 500 is much less than 2 grand"
03-08-2018T14:14:38,Mihari,It's about a third of the cost of a computer right now.
03-08-2018T14:14:46,LannAF,Yuuuup.
03-08-2018T14:14:52,LannAF,"still a better outcome, tho"
03-08-2018T14:14:57,SageSaga,the whole computer brand new with better hardware was 1500
03-08-2018T14:15:09,LannAF,"oh, 1.5k then"
03-08-2018T14:15:11,SageSaga,and that was with a 1070TI
03-08-2018T14:15:18,Mihari,Even still if it is bad RAM it would still need a new computer cause finding new DDR3 is hard.
03-08-2018T14:15:57,Twokinds,"Yeah I wouldn't bother, I'd just get a new mobo and everything else at that point."
03-08-2018T14:16:19,SageSaga,which is my selfish desire
03-08-2018T14:16:23,Bgrmystr2,"wait, finding new DDR3 is hard? No it's not o.O"
03-08-2018T14:16:37,LannAF,oof
03-08-2018T14:17:10,SageSaga,most DDR3 in stock is old
03-08-2018T14:17:22,iliar,"Umbrella For Two looks really nice. Looking at the result, I'm a little sorry that I gave SiliconCarbide the opportunity to sponsor this Nora card"
03-08-2018T14:17:48,Twokinds,lol sorry iliar
03-08-2018T14:17:51,Mihari,By 'new' means manufactured in the last year.
03-08-2018T14:18:05,sunblaze,ah yeah that could be
03-08-2018T14:18:18,Mihari,"Yes you can find ""new"" in retails, but that doesn't mean it's been recently manufactured."
03-08-2018T14:18:53,Bgrmystr2,lol tom you uploaded them in jpgs again :u
03-08-2018T14:19:01,Twokinds,Of course I did
03-08-2018T14:19:37,sunblaze,btw tom I finally framed a flora poster (the one in the lake) and hung it at my wall.
03-08-2018T14:19:41,sunblaze,after 2 years....
03-08-2018T14:19:42,SageSaga,gotta restart clip- beware of daki image appearing
03-08-2018T14:19:45,sunblaze,still pretty :D
03-08-2018T14:20:39,SageSaga,clip restarts are so snappy
03-08-2018T14:20:50,iliar,"I can not say that I'm very upset. It's like in a restaurant. It seems that you ordered exactly what you want. But when you look at what others have ordered, it seems to you that they ordered more delicious things."
03-08-2018T14:22:12,SageSaga,iliar - we will use that saying now instead of Grass is always greener on the other side since soon we will no longer have grass
03-08-2018T14:22:27,Bgrmystr2,"in this case, iliar, you didn't actually get the nora card so you didn't order anything"
03-08-2018T14:22:44,Bgrmystr2,so it's not really a great analogy
03-08-2018T14:23:11,SageSaga,sure it is Bgr- so long as your concept of time isnt limited to that moment
03-08-2018T14:23:26,iliar,Em... I get Nora Card.
03-08-2018T14:23:31,Bgrmystr2,not when your focus is on one thing.
03-08-2018T14:23:41,SageSaga,it's clearly not
03-08-2018T14:24:11,Bgrmystr2,Okay well I'll wait and see the next time someone orders the Umbrella for Two nora card a second time.
03-08-2018T14:24:14,Bgrmystr2,:)
03-08-2018T14:24:40,Tharkis,umbrella for four ! :ctharkis-ewok:
03-08-2018T14:24:49,iliar,"Initially, this Nora Card was sponsored by me. But then SiliconCarbide was very much asked to give him this opportunity. I agreed and used my Nora card on another sketch."
03-08-2018T14:24:51,Bgrmystr2,xD Yes clearly tharkis
03-08-2018T14:25:23,SageSaga,iliar just ignore Bgr- he's got a static method of thinking right now
03-08-2018T14:25:49,sunblaze,it's the heat melts down thinking!
03-08-2018T14:26:08,Bgrmystr2,not my fault ppl miss my point :/
03-08-2018T14:26:38,Tharkis,"hrm, boston comic con next weekend and i cant decide which panels i want to attend.  the cast from back to the future is going to be there"
03-08-2018T14:26:39,Mihari,A point is only as clear as you make it.
03-08-2018T14:26:47,Tharkis,but the whole (surviing) cast of princess bride will be there too
03-08-2018T14:27:11,Tharkis,and most of the panels from those 2 overlap eachother
03-08-2018T14:27:12,sunblaze,same timeslot tharkis?
03-08-2018T14:27:13,Bgrmystr2,"Yes, I thought so as well Mihari, but over the years, I learned I was wrong"
03-08-2018T14:27:27,Bgrmystr2,"that sounds like fun, Thark"
03-08-2018T14:27:41,Twokinds,Bu then you got human nora
03-08-2018T14:28:28,iliar,No. You are entangled in the queue.
03-08-2018T14:28:35,ZoieFalcona,*peeks over Mihari's shoulder*
03-08-2018T14:29:58,Twokinds,Yes I know
03-08-2018T14:30:09,Twokinds,I literally can't resolve it right now
03-08-2018T14:30:24,iliar,"I replaced ""Umbrella For Two"" on... ohh... I dont remember... It seems on Maeve and Adira"
03-08-2018T14:30:37,LannAF,Tom are you working right now?
03-08-2018T14:31:16,Twokinds,"No, obviously"
03-08-2018T14:31:30,LannAF,got discord on that?
03-08-2018T14:31:40,Twokinds,Not at the moment no
03-08-2018T14:31:45,LannAF,ah ok
03-08-2018T14:32:51,LannAF,"I'm kinda sad, they pushed back the update on 7 days to die to..Who knows when"
03-08-2018T14:33:01,LannAF,Because they decided to upgrade to unity 2018
03-08-2018T14:34:10,iliar,"You forced me look at the logs. I replaced ""Umbrella For Two"" on ""Colin Snuggling"""
03-08-2018T14:34:45,Mihari,"Guys, drop it, just be fortunate you have a Nora card at all, and you got to see what you wanted done."
03-08-2018T14:35:52,Twokinds,Well I liked Colin Snuggling... &gt;_&gt;
03-08-2018T14:36:00,LannAF,snuggles are great
03-08-2018T14:36:19,LannAF,especially if you include face smooshing
03-08-2018T14:36:22,Tharkis,"headpats &gt; snuggles, but both are good :ctharkis-headpat:"
03-08-2018T14:36:31,ZoieFalcona,*snuggles into her beanbag chair*

03-08-2018T14:58:01,Bgrmystr2,:/
03-08-2018T14:58:08,TheGamePlayer,Never paid
03-08-2018T14:58:51,TheGamePlayer,You go to the piolet and say hey here's $20 fly me around town
03-08-2018T14:59:15,Bgrmystr2,"what, that cheap?"
03-08-2018T14:59:23,SageSaga,that seems awfully cheap
03-08-2018T14:59:30,TheGamePlayer,It was part of the local fair that happens every year
03-08-2018T14:59:32,SageSaga,i wouldnt trust it
03-08-2018T14:59:38,Bgrmystr2,"same, Sage"
03-08-2018T14:59:44,TheGamePlayer,It's only a five minute flight
03-08-2018T14:59:58,TheGamePlayer,So I'm not too upset
03-08-2018T15:00:03,SageSaga,"""Ok now that we are up here- give me more money or you go down the fast way"""
03-08-2018T15:00:12,Bgrmystr2,haha
03-08-2018T15:00:20,TheGamePlayer,XD
03-08-2018T15:00:37,FoxxTrotter,I've been on a helicopter before during a special event at the County Airport years ago. It was pretty cool.
03-08-2018T15:00:56,TheGamePlayer,I saw it flying by and it was like only 100 feet off the ground but that still would kill
03-08-2018T15:01:59,FoxxTrotter,"The Movie Memphis is currently on display in New York and is also available for rides on certain dates this summer. Unfortunately, it's not during the time I'll be up there at the end of the month."
03-08-2018T15:02:05,FoxxTrotter,Memphis Belle*
03-08-2018T15:03:11,SageSaga,and if it didnt kill ya- he would repeatedly land on you
03-08-2018T15:04:10,SageSaga,"hop out- get your wallet out- take the money- throw it on your corpse- and then turn to the crowd - ""Who wants to go up next?!"""
03-08-2018T15:04:26,TheGamePlayer,XD
03-08-2018T15:04:34,Bgrmystr2,lool
03-08-2018T15:04:35,TheGamePlayer,Like GTA V
03-08-2018T15:04:58,Bgrmystr2,too bad it wouldn't flatten your body
03-08-2018T15:05:07,SageSaga,it doesnt need to
03-08-2018T15:05:21,Bgrmystr2,"maybe not, but it's for effect"
03-08-2018T15:05:27,Bgrmystr2,:c
03-08-2018T15:07:47,TorqueEmUp,"Bleh, one of those days..."
03-08-2018T15:07:49,TheGamePlayer,Get a grappling hook connect the body to the help and fly around with it
03-08-2018T15:08:06,TheGamePlayer,Heli
03-08-2018T15:08:23,TorqueEmUp,"Just want to sit and do nothing, but at the same time bored af."
03-08-2018T15:08:32,TheGamePlayer,Same
03-08-2018T15:08:58,TorqueEmUp,"Forcing myself to work, then at least i I make money."
03-08-2018T15:10:52,TheGamePlayer,XD i switched to my pc and my profile pic finaly changed at its hilarius
03-08-2018T15:11:13,TheGamePlayer,was just on my phone

03-08-2018T15:12:41,Bgrmystr2,*BZZZZZZ*
03-08-2018T15:12:52,Bgrmystr2,like an episode of loony toons lol
03-08-2018T15:13:18,ZoieFalcona,Ow.... no

03-08-2018T15:13:45,Bgrmystr2,can't unsay
03-08-2018T15:14:21,TheGamePlayer,or like in Just cause 3 thats what i was talking about
03-08-2018T15:14:28,TheGamePlayer,or just JC2
03-08-2018T15:14:54,SageSaga,"when i was a young lad, i took one of my sisters barbie dolls and tied a rope around its neck- hooked it up to the ceiling fan in her room- and waited- she went to her room and turned on the light- the fan came on- and barbie went for a spin"
03-08-2018T15:15:09,SageSaga,she wouldnt stop screaming and didnt think to just- turn off the fan
03-08-2018T15:15:24,Bgrmystr2,xD that's mean
03-08-2018T15:15:28,Bgrmystr2,"funny, tho"
03-08-2018T15:15:37,SageSaga,she was mean :P
03-08-2018T15:15:41,Bgrmystr2,maybe.
03-08-2018T15:16:18,SageSaga,she broke a window in the house throwing a ball- and blamed me- i was too young to talk to defend myself!
03-08-2018T15:16:41,TheGamePlayer,XD
03-08-2018T15:16:48,Bgrmystr2,yeah kids are lil shits xD
03-08-2018T15:16:54,Bgrmystr2,they blame everything but themselves
03-08-2018T15:16:56,Mihari,"My niece does that to her sister, jokes on her tho, we have cameras in all the rooms she's allowed in!"
03-08-2018T15:17:11,TheGamePlayer,ya i got two little bros that arent that nice
03-08-2018T15:17:30,Tharkis,"dont plan on having kids, but if i do, there will be survelance cams everywhere =D"
03-08-2018T15:17:44,Tharkis,orwell eat your heart out
03-08-2018T15:17:46,ZoieFalcona,"Hehe, that actually is a good idea, Mihari!"
03-08-2018T15:17:50,SageSaga,i feel sorry for kids these days- they cant screw up without it being remembered forever on the internet
03-08-2018T15:18:12,TheGamePlayer,ya
03-08-2018T15:18:17,TheGamePlayer,not really
03-08-2018T15:18:17,Tharkis,unfortunately it doesnt seem to stop and make them think twice
03-08-2018T15:18:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Ello o/
03-08-2018T15:18:20,Mihari,"Mine aren't cloud cameras, I have a deck that does the digital recording."
03-08-2018T15:18:49,sunblaze,^probably a good and reasonable idea
03-08-2018T15:18:54,SageSaga,at what age will you let them do social sites?
03-08-2018T15:19:05,TheGamePlayer,20
03-08-2018T15:19:13,TheGamePlayer,if i have kids
03-08-2018T15:19:38,ZoieFalcona,"My lil Zoey already knows about Twitter, Youtube, and all of that"
03-08-2018T15:20:02,ZoieFalcona,She surprised the daylights out of me when she shown me she was doing it
03-08-2018T15:20:04,FoxxTrotter,Kids? What are they? ;0P
03-08-2018T15:20:08,FoxxTrotter,Me no have any.
03-08-2018T15:20:12,SageSaga,knows about it - but is she participating in it?
03-08-2018T15:21:11,ZoieFalcona,twitter.. no.  Youtube.. not yet to my knowledge though with all the kiddo programs like Jakes Toy Review and the Engineering Family.. she has been asking Grey to do something similar..
03-08-2018T15:21:49,SageSaga,that's expensive
03-08-2018T15:22:18,ZoieFalcona,Yeah... money we sure as hell don't have!
03-08-2018T15:22:33,SageSaga,"""Can you do toy reviews?"" ""Why sweetie?"" ""Because when you are done- i can have the toys"""
03-08-2018T15:22:57,Bgrmystr2,sounds about right lol
03-08-2018T15:23:28,ZoieFalcona,to a degree some toy companies start giving them shit as well as other toy delivery companies so they can advertise their stuff and the kids get the toys for free
03-08-2018T15:23:47,ZoieFalcona,"Parents get money, kids get toys, those companies get advertising...."
03-08-2018T15:23:49,SageSaga,yeah but you have to build to that
03-08-2018T15:24:42,SageSaga,building an audience isnt easy
03-08-2018T15:25:13,ZoieFalcona,That I know... and I tried telling Zoey that.  Even Grey has told her that and he has only started doing game streams.
03-08-2018T15:26:24,happyguyone,Some of that  toy company stuff sounds highly unethical
03-08-2018T15:27:43,SageSaga,"i agree but i think a lot of the ""messed up kidstuff"" is worse"
03-08-2018T15:28:01,sunblaze,messed up kidstuff?
03-08-2018T15:28:16,SageSaga,people making videos of themselves and their friends dressed up as Disney characters doing horrible things to people- and it gets labeled as for kids
03-08-2018T15:28:35,sunblaze,oh yeah that for sure
03-08-2018T15:28:45,SageSaga,so they get a ton of free views from kids sat in front of a screen watching youtubeKids
03-08-2018T15:28:52,Dadrobit,"""Apples and Banannas Minnie Mouse finds it Difficult to Breathe"""
03-08-2018T15:29:04,Dadrobit,Have fun
03-08-2018T15:29:39,SageSaga,"you walk in and find your kid watching a video about ""The Joker"" kidnapping and tying up Elsa and Bella and forcing them into a closet"
03-08-2018T15:30:02,SageSaga,you know - For kids!
03-08-2018T15:30:24,MarsupialRogueDraws,My favorite was Elsa's Brain Surgery
03-08-2018T15:30:38,sunblaze,do I want to google that?
03-08-2018T15:31:48,SageSaga,point is- that stuff was made to trick parents into making their kids watch it since Youtube couldnt tell the content and it just got spat out from autoplay
03-08-2018T15:32:32,SageSaga,heck there was that one story of a young boy who started spouting anti-feminist things to his mother- turns out somehow his autoplay got into Alt-Right political stuff
03-08-2018T15:34:10,SageSaga,"""Mom, im just saying you arent doing your job making more white babies. We are getting out bread by the blacks and mexicans"" ""What the heck have you been watching?!"""
03-08-2018T15:34:26,SageSaga,lol bread instead of bred
03-08-2018T15:34:45,SageSaga,i can see a kid thinking that though-
03-08-2018T15:34:48,sunblaze,sadly that could indeed be :(
03-08-2018T15:35:21,SageSaga,wat?
03-08-2018T15:35:42,sunblaze,that children could watch that shit uncontrolled
03-08-2018T15:36:06,SageSaga,well yeah- they are- parents need to keep an eye on it XD
03-08-2018T15:37:57,ZoieFalcona,"WE have to do that here.  The rare times we dont, Zoey comes up with some stuff what boggles the hell out of Grey and I of how she learned that. The clip art on some youtube videos are misleading"
03-08-2018T15:37:58,Mihari,When do we find out what that outfit can do?
03-08-2018T15:38:14,ZoieFalcona,"Hmm, good question, Mihari!"
03-08-2018T15:38:20,SageSaga,Next Chapter!
03-08-2018T15:39:06,ZoieFalcona,((nice way of getting us back on track with the arts... Mihari gets fresh tea n snuggles
03-08-2018T15:39:08,SageSaga,Seriously - Next Chapter has a lot of action
03-08-2018T15:39:19,FoxxTrotter,:0)
03-08-2018T15:39:29,sunblaze,next chapter is the journes back with the archeologist right?
03-08-2018T15:40:27,SageSaga,yep
03-08-2018T15:41:32,sunblaze,cool glorious OP kaylin action
03-08-2018T15:43:00,Tharkis,"nyna + spaceman, pew pew, mew mew !"
03-08-2018T15:43:20,sunblaze,haha yes :D
03-08-2018T15:45:57,ZoieFalcona,oh god...
03-08-2018T15:48:05,SageSaga,Nyna would not be able to stand traveling with Mike
03-08-2018T15:48:49,ZoieFalcona,"Well, fodder for comedy!"
03-08-2018T15:50:00,SageSaga,and in a physical fight- while Mike can hold up pretty darn well- he'd lose in any drawn out fight without his weapon
03-08-2018T15:50:42,Tharkis,proof that kitty &gt; spaceman !
03-08-2018T15:50:48,Tharkis,:ctharkis-earwiggle:
03-08-2018T15:50:51,sunblaze,clearly he need somehome that carries his heavy gun
03-08-2018T15:50:57,sunblaze,the one dismanteled from his ship!
03-08-2018T15:51:21,SageSaga,his real ship is still in space- the one on the ground is his scout ship
03-08-2018T15:51:42,sunblaze,still scout weaponry would suffice... for now
03-08-2018T15:51:55,SageSaga,cept it doesnt work
03-08-2018T15:52:08,SageSaga,technically his gun doesnt work how it should either :P
03-08-2018T15:52:24,sunblaze,it does not matter how good your dodging skills are or how good you are at slicing throats if you get nuked from orbit!
03-08-2018T15:52:36,sunblaze,awww :(
03-08-2018T15:53:41,SageSaga,Page 19 we learn more about that
03-08-2018T15:54:22,sunblaze,as much as I enjoy fantasy-settings the ocasional space battle is a good way to cool down on sword+magic
03-08-2018T15:55:40,SageSaga,"i still find it funny to hear people in comments say ""Well it has to be this because it's just impossible otherwise"" and im like ""You lack imagination"""
03-08-2018T15:56:24,ZRO4825,lol
03-08-2018T15:56:46,sunblaze,yeah it's the ocasional rules? who needs rules if you are the GM?
03-08-2018T15:57:17,ZRO4825,Sage be like :csagesaga-c3:
03-08-2018T15:57:40,sunblaze,^except both eyes sparkle!
03-08-2018T15:57:48,SageSaga,:csagesaga-c2:
03-08-2018T15:58:16,SageSaga,they just dont think beyond what they assume
03-08-2018T15:58:56,sunblaze,assume =/ proof
03-08-2018T15:59:08,sunblaze,and that was supposed to be a /= smilie
03-08-2018T15:59:45,Tharkis,rules mongers dont get far in D&D games with my group &gt;_&lt;
03-08-2018T15:59:59,Tharkis,DM word is final
03-08-2018T16:00:13,SageSaga,DMs are human too
03-08-2018T16:00:27,Mihari,And they sometimes miss or forget things.
03-08-2018T16:00:33,sunblaze,yeah if you thing something is anti-fun discuss it! not demant it!
03-08-2018T16:00:59,Mihari,"But a player should never feel entilted, if you want something, come up with a way to plausibly obtain it!"
03-08-2018T16:01:03,Tharkis,yeah but there's a difference between correcting someone... and rules mongering &gt;_&lt;
03-08-2018T16:01:30,SageSaga,if the DM puts their foot down you should call it there- but if you say wis save when it should be int save- say it
03-08-2018T16:01:42,Tharkis,"with luck any tabletop RPG groups you've been in have never had a true 'rule-monger"""
03-08-2018T16:02:06,Mihari,"I might be missing something, but could you explain what a 'rule-monger' is?"
03-08-2018T16:02:21,SageSaga,me back in the day
03-08-2018T16:02:50,FoxxTrotter,"I would assume it's like ""My way or the highway."""
03-08-2018T16:02:54,FoxxTrotter,In a sense.
03-08-2018T16:03:01,SageSaga,it was a defense mechanism against a DM that thought his job was to kill the party and not make the game fun
03-08-2018T16:03:02,sunblaze,yeah I see myself at rule arguing more often then I want as well. but if there is a decision you have to accept it
03-08-2018T16:03:14,Tharkis,a rule-monger is someone whose a total slave for the rules and will yell kick and scream about any deviation from the strict rules as written in XYZ book
03-08-2018T16:03:21,sunblaze,thats a kinda harsh DM take :P
03-08-2018T16:03:34,SageSaga,that DM was a bag of dicks
03-08-2018T16:03:48,sunblaze,that bad? oh my
03-08-2018T16:03:50,SageSaga,and since he kept wanting to point at the rule book- i pointed back
03-08-2018T16:04:06,Tharkis,yeah that doesnt sound like a fun group =/
03-08-2018T16:04:12,SageSaga,its why i built the whip master in the first pace
03-08-2018T16:04:15,SageSaga,place*
03-08-2018T16:04:35,SageSaga,he was a dick - so i tripped all the people and beat them to death when they tried to stand up
03-08-2018T16:04:54,sunblaze,haha :D I need to remeber that concept!
03-08-2018T16:04:57,SageSaga,forced him to use more larger targets- and surprise- our party also had a dwarven giant slayer
03-08-2018T16:05:35,sunblaze,thats almost as if players cooperate! unheard of!
03-08-2018T16:05:39,SageSaga,so he got upset and stopped DMing and let others step up - and we had better DMs
03-08-2018T16:06:55,sunblaze,why did he even think it was his job to kill you in the first place?
03-08-2018T16:07:04,sunblaze,I eman it happens yes but main focus?
03-08-2018T16:07:08,SageSaga,im sorry but when your DM starts bragging about making enemies that are immune to your builds - well they earn their title as dick bags
03-08-2018T16:07:46,Tharkis,"yeah, sounds like a dick to me"
03-08-2018T16:08:01,SageSaga,i made a Cleric SUPER heavy on the support role because it was a dangerous campaign world- my friend made a fighter as my body guard
03-08-2018T16:08:25,SageSaga,so he was focused on crowd control like tripping and being able to step up and guard me
03-08-2018T16:08:56,SageSaga,so he made vampires that had some stupid anti-tripping ability =_=
03-08-2018T16:09:20,sunblaze,hmmm I alwy thought if you ahve legs = you can be tripped
03-08-2018T16:09:21,SageSaga,its like - dude- have people use ranged attacks in an ambush- dont negate our feats because of bull crap
03-08-2018T16:09:24,sunblaze,no legs = antitrip
03-08-2018T16:09:33,sunblaze,he should have uses a snake or similar
03-08-2018T16:09:48,SageSaga,yeah
03-08-2018T16:10:14,SageSaga,he was an idiot - anyways- with him gone I ran some games and my friend Eric ran games- Eric was awesome as a DM
03-08-2018T16:10:35,SageSaga,hes the kinda nerd that can quote LotR - and i dont mean the movies
03-08-2018T16:11:21,Tharkis,my kinda nerd!
03-08-2018T16:11:48,SageSaga,he has the one ring tattooed on his arm and Yggdrasil on his other arm
03-08-2018T16:12:08,sunblaze,^cool
03-08-2018T16:13:29,SageSaga,oh and then there was the other DM- who couldnt come up with his own ideas so he stole stories from Buffy the Vampire slayer and Marvel comics
03-08-2018T16:14:05,sunblaze,haha
03-08-2018T16:14:21,sunblaze,I did that once from stargate atlantis.
03-08-2018T16:14:36,sunblaze,you jsut need to keep it VERY rarely and noone notices
03-08-2018T16:16:04,SageSaga,it pissed me off because he took my characters little brother and turned him into a copy of the Buffy story where she suddenly has a sister-
03-08-2018T16:16:25,SageSaga,"and i was like ""Great- i guess this makes my character Buffy"""
03-08-2018T16:16:50,Tharkis,"i duno, your character being buffy isnt the worst thing =P"
03-08-2018T16:16:51,sunblaze,awwww player meddling without talking with the player is a stupid move
03-08-2018T16:17:15,Tharkis,also i liked the season 8 story where Dawn got cursed with a TF curse and kept turning into differen things
03-08-2018T16:17:23,Tharkis,(but that was comics only)
03-08-2018T16:17:43,sunblaze,what? why did they not film that?
03-08-2018T16:17:50,sunblaze,that would have gotten me into buffy imho
03-08-2018T16:17:58,Tharkis,because season 7 was the last TV season heh
03-08-2018T16:18:04,sunblaze,oh I seee
03-08-2018T16:18:16,Tharkis,post season 7 lots of cool stuff happen
03-08-2018T16:18:22,SageSaga,"another DM i had issues with wouldnt let us play our characters- his descriptions included stuff our characters did and said - and im like ""I never said that- why would I say that? Why are you telling me what I said?"""
03-08-2018T16:18:33,Tharkis,like Spike gets on a space ship and has his own bug-minion crew to fly around the galaxy
03-08-2018T16:18:56,Tharkis,"yuck, that's one of my least favorite types"
03-08-2018T16:19:04,Tharkis,"the 'its' my story, your characters will do what i tell you' type of DM"
03-08-2018T16:19:34,ZoieFalcona,Oy..
03-08-2018T16:19:36,Tharkis,one of the coolest things that ALMOST happened ... but unfortunately didnt
03-08-2018T16:19:49,Tharkis,"I had some friends who worked at 38 studios, they moved just down the road from me"
03-08-2018T16:19:58,sunblaze,wow I had jsut 1 bad GM that went AWOL with n explanation another was medicore but so far not that bad.
03-08-2018T16:20:04,sunblaze,sorry sage :(
03-08-2018T16:20:10,Tharkis,"one of their group members was Geno Salvatore, and their sometimes DM was Bob (R.A.) Salvatore"
03-08-2018T16:20:18,Tharkis,and they had invited me to join their group since they were local now
03-08-2018T16:20:35,Tharkis,and then 38 studios went under and failed spectacularly and their D&D group broke up =(
03-08-2018T16:20:41,sunblaze,awww
03-08-2018T16:20:42,SageSaga,aww
03-08-2018T16:20:53,SageSaga,would be cool to play with Legends like them
03-08-2018T16:20:53,Tharkis,so i never got to play a game with R.A. Salvatore as the DM
03-08-2018T16:21:08,Tharkis,so it was ALMOST the coolest thing hah
03-08-2018T16:21:14,SageSaga,BUT- then again
03-08-2018T16:21:48,SageSaga,it is RA Salvatore - and no one really likes Drizzt
03-08-2018T16:22:26,SageSaga,that's a joke- of course people like him but hes so OP
03-08-2018T16:22:41,ZoieFalcona,Hmm....
03-08-2018T16:22:42,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs not many D&D groups around here that‚Äôd allow a GIRL to join the group
03-08-2018T16:22:45,Tharkis,"heh, even Salvatore will say Drizzt is OP / a twink / etc =P"
03-08-2018T16:23:18,SageSaga,we had girls join us all the time
03-08-2018T16:23:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt have the time to do any kind of regular thing anyway
03-08-2018T16:23:45,Tharkis,"a friend of mine out in NY state used to play D&D with Garry Gygax a lot, and is still best friends with the Gygax family"
03-08-2018T16:23:52,Tharkis,now THAT's playing with a true legend!
03-08-2018T16:24:02,SageSaga,we had one that played a female Gnoll character named Gyrl
03-08-2018T16:24:07,Tharkis,"kinda jealous, he still meets up with gygax's son every year for gencon"
03-08-2018T16:24:14,Tharkis,(incidentally which is this weekend i think?)
03-08-2018T16:24:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I do seem to get odd looks when I mention something about it
03-08-2018T16:24:41,SageSaga,"she carried my Halfling ""Cleric"" around and i fed her oranges"
03-08-2018T16:24:48,Xexanoth,Did you greet her character with: Sup Gyrl
03-08-2018T16:25:06,Tharkis,lol
03-08-2018T16:25:10,sunblaze,:D
03-08-2018T16:25:56,SageSaga,"that ""Cleric"" was awesome"
03-08-2018T16:26:07,SageSaga,especially after i got Gauntlets of Ogre Strength
03-08-2018T16:26:13,Tharkis,i guess my sole claim to fame in the tabletop world is there's a Tharkis in the Demonwars campaign setting.  I'm one of the evil heretics in the rule book
03-08-2018T16:26:25,Tharkis,"haha, 18-00 cleric SMASH!"
03-08-2018T16:26:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom mentioned any computer progress recently?
03-08-2018T16:26:44,SageSaga,"""I wrestle him to the ground"" Dm- ""Ok roll... yep- the cultist cries out ""Oh gods! His tiny hands are so strong!"""
03-08-2018T16:26:54,Tharkis,haha
03-08-2018T16:26:55,sunblaze,:D
03-08-2018T16:27:06,Tharkis,help the midget is kicking my ass!
03-08-2018T16:27:12,Tharkis,*runs around in a paniced circle *
03-08-2018T16:27:36,SageSaga,i then intimidated them all into thinking I was the messenger of their demon god
03-08-2018T16:27:47,sunblaze,that surely gets you fame in evil-cult circles
03-08-2018T16:28:44,SageSaga,when you are a warlock of an eldritch being from beyond the stars you get certain perks
03-08-2018T16:29:42,SageSaga,one being when you are also able to use Cleric Cantrips thanks to your book of shadows you can do stuff like make your eyes turn black and make your voice boom like a giants bellow
03-08-2018T16:30:09,SageSaga,oh and telepathy
03-08-2018T16:31:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember I saw that archeologists have found ancient die in Egyptian tombs
03-08-2018T16:31:12,SageSaga,"""I've learned all we need to know- its ok that they killed themselves"" ""How?"" ""I saw the truth in their eyes"" ""You used that mind thing again didnt you?"" ""Perhaps"""
03-08-2018T16:31:36,Tharkis,"heh, i still use the name Tharkis for eveyrthing and that was the name of a D&D character i made when i was 10 or 11 when one of my best friend's dads was our DM, we played for several years"
03-08-2018T16:31:43,SpazztasticKiwi,And somebody commented: Egyptian D&D ‚ÄúI roll to bluff Anubis‚Äù
03-08-2018T16:31:46,SageSaga,maannnn i miss playing Rubin Rumplestumper
03-08-2018T16:31:58,Tharkis,Tharkis started out a half elven mage/thief but he got killed a few times
03-08-2018T16:32:14,Tharkis,"and our party had a druid , adn was too cheap to pay for resurections, so the druid used reincarnate a few times"
03-08-2018T16:32:28,Tharkis,so Tharkis ended up several different things before the end of the campaign
03-08-2018T16:33:01,Xexanoth,free transformation XD
03-08-2018T16:33:25,Tharkis,used the Unearthed Arcana (2nd ED) reincarnate table in that campaign
03-08-2018T16:34:37,Tharkis,since it didnt have any non-humanoid races that would make us have to 'retire' the character
03-08-2018T16:34:46,SageSaga,i think- im done
03-08-2018T16:34:55,FoxxTrotter,"Nice work, Sage. :0)"
03-08-2018T16:35:05,Tharkis,"looks good, i like the expressions =)"
03-08-2018T16:35:13,sunblaze,I love the clouds :D
03-08-2018T16:35:35,SageSaga,I used the clouds a bit in this one to try and show the emotions a bit
03-08-2018T16:35:38,BadFoMo,I like the expressions too.
03-08-2018T16:35:42,SageSaga,i dont often try that-
03-08-2018T16:35:51,sunblaze,nice work then!
03-08-2018T16:35:53,BadFoMo,"...Aols, hi."
03-08-2018T16:36:00,BadFoMo,*Also
03-08-2018T16:36:05,FoxxTrotter,"Hey, FoMo."
03-08-2018T16:36:09,SageSaga,panel one i tried to make them kinda hopeful wide spread and stuff- high in the air
03-08-2018T16:36:37,SageSaga,then more calm and normal- then a little whispy- then erratic in the second to last panel
03-08-2018T16:36:45,Bgrmystr2,looks good sage
03-08-2018T16:38:15,SageSaga,i wanna add a new song but theres a creepy laugh in it and some weird lines-
03-08-2018T16:39:00,Xexanoth,sounds like a nice surprise....
03-08-2018T16:39:53,SageSaga,i'll play it after this and let me know XD
03-08-2018T16:40:19,SageSaga,i'll play the short version since i havent listened to the full thing yet
03-08-2018T16:40:55,SageSaga,but its by the same people who did this song- and i really like this and the previous one
03-08-2018T16:41:38,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
03-08-2018T16:41:51,ZoieFalcona,I loved my first DM... introduced me to D&D 2nd back in middle school. Convinced me to go with an evil bugger of a bugbearcleric
03-08-2018T16:42:47,SageSaga,here we go- unless there is an ad-
03-08-2018T16:43:00,SageSaga,ha - ad
03-08-2018T16:43:08,FoxxTrotter,Typical. :0P
03-08-2018T16:43:28,ZoieFalcona,huh?!
03-08-2018T16:43:45,Xexanoth,"oh, it|s just the overlord intro"
03-08-2018T16:43:48,Tharkis,overlord!
03-08-2018T16:43:54,Tharkis,\o/
03-08-2018T16:43:57,Bgrmystr2,huh
03-08-2018T16:44:16,Bgrmystr2,It's not bad
03-08-2018T16:44:22,Xexanoth,cant wait to see em fuck up the rest of season 3 o/
03-08-2018T16:44:23,ZoieFalcona,"I got the sound off here,"
03-08-2018T16:44:24,Bgrmystr2,"I like it, it's a bit erratic"
03-08-2018T16:44:33,SageSaga,im hoping the full thing is better or as good
03-08-2018T16:44:48,Bgrmystr2,usually is.
03-08-2018T16:45:01,SageSaga,the previous MHA one wasnt
03-08-2018T16:45:07,SageSaga,but yeah- usually XD
03-08-2018T16:45:14,Bgrmystr2,"That one I don't know, haven't heard it"
03-08-2018T16:45:23,SageSaga,oh boy- stick around then - lets do this
03-08-2018T16:45:27,Bgrmystr2,"or if I have, I don't know it"
03-08-2018T16:46:03,Bgrmystr2,AD
03-08-2018T16:46:05,SageSaga,this is the TV version - the short one
03-08-2018T16:46:13,SageSaga,aka the good one
03-08-2018T16:46:15,Bgrmystr2,ah this song okay
03-08-2018T16:46:15,Tharkis,boku no hero \o/
03-08-2018T16:46:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,\o/
03-08-2018T16:46:24,SageSaga,My Hero sir
03-08-2018T16:46:47,Bgrmystr2,Hero my Boku :V
03-08-2018T16:47:31,BadFoMo,"""This video is brought to you by Ammu-Nation. Remember to put litter in its place."""
03-08-2018T16:47:32,SageSaga,and now the full version
03-08-2018T16:47:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Sage have you heard the Jonathon young version of that one?
03-08-2018T16:47:51,Bgrmystr2,yeah the short one had a nice buildup
03-08-2018T16:49:11,Tharkis,A band that's been used a lot for anime opening tracks who is wicked good is Yousei Teikoku (Das Feenreich)
03-08-2018T16:50:10,Bgrmystr2,MAL only lists like 7 or so
03-08-2018T16:50:12,Bgrmystr2,for them
03-08-2018T16:50:39,Bgrmystr2,oo this sax tho
03-08-2018T16:51:14,Tharkis,that sax now has me picturing Tim Cappello dressed as All Might
03-08-2018T16:51:32,SageSaga,see?
03-08-2018T16:51:36,Bgrmystr2,the full song's interesting. It's a bit unorthadox in how the song is structured at the beginning
03-08-2018T16:51:50,Bgrmystr2,but yeah it's not the ordinary
03-08-2018T16:52:01,SageSaga,the TV version is all the best parts of the song ripped out
03-08-2018T16:52:11,Bgrmystr2,the sax is nice though :U
03-08-2018T16:52:21,SageSaga,so the only thing that is added by the full song is some weirdness- some distortions - and some sax
03-08-2018T16:52:32,Bgrmystr2,but yeah the short one feels better cuz it's more of a standard fare
03-08-2018T16:53:15,Bgrmystr2,"I'd prolly expect a bit more from that track in particular, myself"
03-08-2018T16:53:32,SageSaga,peace folks! thanks for coming
03-08-2018T16:53:36,Tharkis,thanks for the stream!
03-08-2018T16:53:37,ZoieFalcona,Aww.. take care Sage :)
03-08-2018T16:53:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Thanks for the stream
03-08-2018T16:53:39,FoxxTrotter,"Thanks for the stream, Sage."
03-08-2018T16:53:40,Bgrmystr2,thanks for streamin sage
03-08-2018T16:53:45,FoxxTrotter,"Later, everyone. :0)"
03-08-2018T16:53:47,Bgrmystr2,gl with food and stuff :v
03-08-2018T17:02:28,TorqueEmUp,:ctorqueemup-natanisleep:
03-08-2018T17:14:21,TheGamePlayer,NOOOOO my fav TV character WAS JUST KILLED
03-08-2018T17:14:55,Bgrmystr2,"well, don't say what yer watchin, cuz that's be spoilers :U"
03-08-2018T17:14:56,TheGamePlayer,also not in real life in the show
03-08-2018T17:15:06,TheGamePlayer,im so sad
03-08-2018T19:53:03,SpazztasticKiwi,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
03-08-2018T20:22:48,HobbitGames,Tom end the stream vecause of his comouter yestersay?
03-08-2018T20:51:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Yep
03-08-2018T20:51:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Evidently it decided to just give him the middle finger
03-08-2018T21:50:13,Dadrobit,:middle_finger_tone2:
03-08-2018T22:07:07,TorqueEmUp,Thought he was going to try using Mark's old computer. Guess that didn't pan out.
03-08-2018T22:16:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Well we haven‚Äôt got an update
03-08-2018T22:17:33,SpazztasticKiwi,But he also mentioned trying his old computer. Earlier he was asked if he was doing any work and he replied with a seemingly salty ‚Äúno‚Äù (to paraphrase)
03-08-2018T22:20:42,TorqueEmUp,oof
03-08-2018T22:21:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder if Mark has spare computers. Cause I can see it now though if he uses Mark‚Äôs: he‚Äôll come home for thanksgiving and have nothing to record with
03-08-2018T22:23:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Neither appear to have a chill button. Gotta work work work work
03-08-2018T22:40:16,TorqueEmUp,Well I don't have high hopes for tomorrow then. :P
03-08-2018T23:05:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe he‚Äôs got some good stuff going. He had today. Hopefully to himself
03-08-2018T23:07:32,SpazztasticKiwi,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:

03-08-2018T23:28:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Sage may have had a point though when he said he hopes it‚Äôs completely dead
03-08-2018T23:47:16,Bgrmystr2,"Tech can always be salvaged, and problems can always be solved. So I still disagree."
03-08-2018T23:47:30,Dadrobit,"When he was talking about using his old computer, or Mark's, he mentioned that they were not set up for streaming with Picarto, so the page would be behind the scenes at that point."
