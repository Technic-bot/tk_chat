16-08-2018T20:45:20,FFrost,All handholding must be performed with gloves on under strict supervision.
16-08-2018T20:45:32,Bgrmystr2,Kanna has two n's btw Lann

16-08-2018T20:45:48,unsteddyphoenix,Eye contact may only last up to 3 seconds MAXIMUM
16-08-2018T20:46:00,Bgrmystr2,"Lann, that's the 2nd best place to be other than too out of range"
16-08-2018T20:46:08,SageSaga,you underestimate me Lann- and my plan
16-08-2018T20:46:10,Bgrmystr2,cuz a minigun is a heafty weapon.
16-08-2018T20:46:18,Bgrmystr2,you can't aim it faster than someone can move
16-08-2018T20:46:26,Bgrmystr2,especially close quarters
16-08-2018T20:46:39,SageSaga,many years of DnD and video games have prepared me to sacrifice myself for a trip to Japan
16-08-2018T20:47:18,SageSaga,"I shall be Fuse, you shall be my family"

16-08-2018T20:48:36,SageSaga,Ron- Lann already said its for his friends- so no - you arent invited
16-08-2018T20:48:56,LannAF,though to be fair it's not hard to become friends with me.

16-08-2018T20:50:31,unsteddyphoenix,The song of nightmares
16-08-2018T20:50:46,LannAF,nah you got grandfathered in before the policy was instilled
16-08-2018T20:50:53,LannAF,That's why I sang tom happy bday
16-08-2018T20:51:13,ZoieFalcona,Oh lordy :P
16-08-2018T20:51:16,Nekonny,XD
16-08-2018T20:51:21,NKato,"Oh, this is a family program?"
16-08-2018T20:51:25,JamesBSquirrel3,:ptv-hearts: Wow! fighster Fluff! I bet I. Carmelita M. Fox will see the Fem-Mike shows beauty! Could it?
16-08-2018T20:51:26,NKato,Wellllllllp.

16-08-2018T20:51:38,Accelo,I love those eyes.
16-08-2018T20:51:46,NKato,"Well, I figured that was the case since TwoKinds isn't the type of IP to want to go down the lewdroad."
16-08-2018T20:51:55,LannAF,my actual criteria for friends is just don't be an ass or elitist
16-08-2018T20:51:56,LannAF,or both
16-08-2018T20:52:01,LannAF,and actually talk lol
16-08-2018T20:52:06,Bgrmystr2,Phoenix.. that's a lot of unfiddlephonopolys
16-08-2018T20:52:16,NKato,"Lann, I'm an elitist...when it comes to manners at least."
16-08-2018T20:52:23,unsteddyphoenix,Well shit im both
16-08-2018T20:52:24,NKato,I dislike rrrrrude people.
16-08-2018T20:52:25,unsteddyphoenix,Rip
16-08-2018T20:52:31,LannAF,"I dun like drama much,"
16-08-2018T20:52:38,LannAF,so if you tend to cause drama I tend to stay away
16-08-2018T20:52:49,NKato,To the point where I was omnipotently capable of delivering german suplexes to those individuals from where I am.
16-08-2018T20:52:52,Nekonny,theres such a grey line with lewd nowerdays
16-08-2018T20:52:54,NKato,I wish I was*
16-08-2018T20:52:57,unsteddyphoenix,I feel that Lann
16-08-2018T20:53:08,unsteddyphoenix,If drama happens I just avoid everyone involved
16-08-2018T20:53:11,LannAF,"eh, I'm fine. I'm good at diffusing situations"
16-08-2018T20:53:12,NKato,I'm pretty tired today though. I was planning on going out to get groceries from Costco...
16-08-2018T20:53:16,LannAF,But if someone's being an ass you just walk away
16-08-2018T20:53:23,NKato,"But I got drowsy on the drive, so decided to just go straight home and not risk it."
16-08-2018T20:53:33,FluffKevlar,"welcome to costco, i love you... welcome to costco.. i love you"
16-08-2018T20:53:39,ZoieFalcona,"looks at Lann, cocking an eyebrow up"
16-08-2018T20:53:42,phyrefox,that was a great movie
16-08-2018T20:53:46,Tokagedraws,yay more Mike stream :3
16-08-2018T20:53:50,FluffKevlar,that was a horror film
16-08-2018T20:54:13,phyrefox,its not very realistic. I doubt you could stack garbage that high in reality ;|
16-08-2018T20:54:16,LannAF,Yes zoie?
16-08-2018T20:54:39,ZoieFalcona,Just trying to picture you walking away with all the trolling
16-08-2018T20:54:47,SinStep,This is actually pretty amazing
16-08-2018T20:54:52,LannAF,"oh nah, the trolling and stuff directed at me usually is in good fun"
16-08-2018T20:55:08,LannAF,but when people are -actually- being dickheads and rude is when it's not worth the time or effort to be around them
16-08-2018T20:55:36,LannAF,I give people the impression of me being an idiot/silly for the sake of entertainment
16-08-2018T20:55:47,LannAF,"But when people take it too far, you're not being a friend. You're just being a shithead."
16-08-2018T20:56:12,LannAF,And honestly I like to do it because it doesn't take effort to be silly.
16-08-2018T20:56:18,Nekonny,"Fluff, do you know anyone that actually used one of those Chinese companies to make figures?"
16-08-2018T20:56:36,Nekonny,"I think Miu might have, but I'm not sure"
16-08-2018T20:56:46,ZoieFalcona,Eradose might have
16-08-2018T20:57:15,FluffKevlar,"yeah i asked Miu, apparently Godai got them from the same people Miu did"
16-08-2018T20:57:47,TouchFluffyTail,Fluff going to get some Fluffy characters made as figures?
16-08-2018T20:57:50,Nekonny,Not the Standies
16-08-2018T20:57:54,TouchFluffyTail,Fuff*
16-08-2018T20:57:59,Nekonny,the actual models

16-08-2018T21:00:45,Ikaribunbun,"I like the fur pattern thing tbh,would like to learn how to do that to texture fur a bit tbh"
16-08-2018T21:00:50,Bgrmystr2,it looks.. fairly standard fluff. Not quite sure what's different about it.
16-08-2018T21:00:53,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering:
16-08-2018T21:00:55,ZoieFalcona,It's not bad at all on the chest fluff pattern so far
16-08-2018T21:01:54,Bgrmystr2,"oh, the video is fairly bad for some reason so I can't actually tell details"
16-08-2018T21:02:01,Bgrmystr2,picarto's not showing it very well at all
16-08-2018T21:02:09,ZoieFalcona,"Go get your noms on, Fluff"
16-08-2018T21:02:14,unsteddyphoenix,"You rarely do direct-lighting, so I didnt quite notice"
16-08-2018T21:02:18,unsteddyphoenix,Ok fluff!
16-08-2018T21:02:23,Bgrmystr2,enjoy your food :)

16-08-2018T21:04:55,LannAF,"Apparently they're suprt short on apprentices and are going to be accepting more, I might have a big chance of getting in"
16-08-2018T21:05:03,SageSaga,congrats
16-08-2018T21:05:05,LannAF,"If I get that job, by the end of schooling for me, we could go to Japan."
16-08-2018T21:05:11,Nekonny,Nice
16-08-2018T21:05:11,LannAF,"Like, no doubt about it."
16-08-2018T21:05:22,LannAF,I'd be getting paid approx 30$ an hour or so by the end of school.

16-08-2018T21:30:24,TouchFluffyTail,Made from the cloak of invisibility?
16-08-2018T21:30:39,Nekonny,"It's a different type of game. People keep complaining about everything being the same same, but when something new comes out that tries something diffrent, you're gonna have those that just cant adapt"
16-08-2018T21:30:40,HotCocoa,there's two shiphands
16-08-2018T21:30:44,HotCocoa,mike isn't alone

16-08-2018T21:30:49,Nekonny,"Oh yeah, I see a lot of people playing MH"
16-08-2018T21:30:51,ZoieFalcona,More like the same fabric of the Emperor's New Clothes
16-08-2018T21:31:07,unsteddyphoenix,Ive just been killing shit with friends and havent done much story
16-08-2018T21:31:10,TouchFluffyTail,Emperors new clothes didn't make him invisible.
16-08-2018T21:31:28,ZoieFalcona,I wanna give it a go since the Rathalos fight in FF14
16-08-2018T21:31:34,HotCocoa,them thighs is so thicc they outta this world
16-08-2018T21:31:37,SageSaga,Ron- i bought a PS4 Pro to play it in January- i put over 300 hours on it- ive put almost 40 hours into the PC version - im not stopping any time soon

16-08-2018T21:31:51,LannAF,But I want to play more with friends
16-08-2018T21:31:55,LannAF,been playing it with tom and sage
16-08-2018T21:31:57,FFrost,People somehow didn't realize what the devs for SOT where saying.
16-08-2018T21:32:01,HotCocoa,"what are these ""friends"" you speak of?"
16-08-2018T21:32:19,LannAF,I wanna give SOT a try.
16-08-2018T21:32:21,unsteddyphoenix,yeah it is~
16-08-2018T21:32:21,Nekonny,"Well, at least you're getting you're money's worth"
16-08-2018T21:32:23,FFrost,"""What's in the last beta is all that'll be in the game, AT FIRST."" and somehow people misunderstood &lt;.&lt;"
16-08-2018T21:32:40,LannAF,"Idk, I saw a HILARIOUS video on it and now I want to play it"
16-08-2018T21:32:46,LannAF,but I want to play with people who don't rage at suff
16-08-2018T21:32:50,LannAF,stuff*
16-08-2018T21:32:59,LannAF,I love playing with people who just laugh everything off
16-08-2018T21:33:05,LannAF,even pvp
16-08-2018T21:33:10,Nekonny,"THey misunderstood what sort of game it is, some just don't know how to play a game anymore"
16-08-2018T21:33:25,unsteddyphoenix,you mustve had some...experiences lann
16-08-2018T21:33:33,LannAF,Meh. Tons.
16-08-2018T21:33:41,Nekonny,Its been especially cool as of late; they have events where you have to cooperate with other teams
16-08-2018T21:33:52,SageSaga,Ron- they released an incomplete game
16-08-2018T21:33:56,Nekonny,no
16-08-2018T21:33:57,LannAF,It feels like lots of people expect too much out of games or just don't play in a relaxed manner
16-08-2018T21:34:01,Nekonny,thats where you are wrong
16-08-2018T21:34:11,Nekonny,they way they released it is briliant
16-08-2018T21:34:11,SageSaga,Get out then
16-08-2018T21:34:15,Redwolf150,hi Fluff

16-08-2018T21:34:35,Nekonny,it wouldnt have worked any other way
16-08-2018T21:34:42,Nekonny,not with how the content is
16-08-2018T21:34:46,FFrost,"It wasn't incomplete, they stated rather clearly ""This is what you'll get."""
16-08-2018T21:34:53,SageSaga,its called a beta or Early access
16-08-2018T21:34:53,unsteddyphoenix,If you just play with friends you never experience rage :upside_down:
16-08-2018T21:35:12,Nekonny,"the events that happen, they wouldnt work if they overlaped"
16-08-2018T21:35:20,HotCocoa,you don't know my friends phoenix
16-08-2018T21:35:26,Nekonny,not the way the game is structured
16-08-2018T21:35:28,ZRO4825,Sage and Fluff both streaming and I don't have to have 2 windows open? WHAT SORCERY IS THIS? :czro4825-ViknAHH:

16-08-2018T22:18:41,robynfox,"Maybe one day, there will be enough of us to fill a small broom closet!"
16-08-2018T22:18:57,ZRO4825,Toyoko + Relm. Best upper limit combination.
16-08-2018T22:19:01,ZRO4825,:thinking:
16-08-2018T22:19:04,Nekonny,I havent actually decided on shading for Sandy yet
16-08-2018T22:19:18,ZRO4825,That...may be a new idea for a birthday image for November....Hmmm...must contemplate....
16-08-2018T22:19:27,Nekonny,I was gong to make the tops of her hair white
16-08-2018T22:19:28,unsteddyphoenix,Zro no
16-08-2018T22:19:33,ZRO4825,ZRO YES!
16-08-2018T22:19:37,unsteddyphoenix,"Dont be mean to Kat, that's just uncalled for."
16-08-2018T22:19:41,ZRO4825,ZRO ALWAYS YES!!!
16-08-2018T22:19:46,Bgrmystr2,fusion technique..?
16-08-2018T22:19:47,Nekonny,"but, interesting question; is fox tail tip supposed to be black or white?"
16-08-2018T22:19:48,unsteddyphoenix,Let's just stick to dead-laura jokes
16-08-2018T22:19:54,Bgrmystr2,zro please :D
16-08-2018T22:19:56,ZRO4825,"Technically, white."
16-08-2018T22:19:57,Bgrmystr2,please yes
16-08-2018T22:19:58,Dadrobit,Be mean to Kat? That's like my forte!
16-08-2018T22:20:00,Tharkis,depends on the species
16-08-2018T22:20:02,Nekonny,White?
16-08-2018T22:20:13,Nekonny,theres ones that vayt that much?
16-08-2018T22:20:19,unsteddyphoenix,Kat never did nothing to nobody :(
16-08-2018T22:20:23,ZRO4825,"Normally white, but is like Tharkis said, specific to species."
16-08-2018T22:20:26,Nekonny,*vary
16-08-2018T22:20:26,Tharkis,white is the mor common though
16-08-2018T22:20:51,Nekonny,but ears are either black or r red/ornage
16-08-2018T22:21:04,Nekonny,right?
16-08-2018T22:21:23,Tharkis,yeah for the common red fox
16-08-2018T22:21:27,Tharkis,white tip of tail but black tippedi ers

16-08-2018T22:23:58,Nekonny,hum
16-08-2018T22:24:02,robynfox,*Gesundheit
16-08-2018T22:24:41,Nekonny,one of the reasons I havent shaded any of her drawings yet is because I havetn't decided how to do the hair XD
16-08-2018T22:25:07,ZRO4825,Rainbows! =D
16-08-2018T22:25:11,Nekonny,"so ears are always black, regardless of species?"
16-08-2018T22:25:20,Dadrobit,pls no sparkledog
16-08-2018T22:25:29,ZRO4825,Arctic foxes are white all over~
16-08-2018T22:25:39,Nekonny,"I mean, I like them black, even if I had an option. works better with the rest of the outfit design"
16-08-2018T22:25:51,ZRO4825,"They're not ALWAYS black, but black ears ARE prevalent among foxes, for sure."
16-08-2018T22:26:25,Tharkis,there are a few that dont have black ears but ears being black is the'norm' yeah
16-08-2018T22:27:25,Nekonny,hu

16-08-2018T22:42:32,BadFoMo,Bye.
16-08-2018T22:42:53,Deimobos,ive been trying to start a unofficial picarto discord server and only one streamer from here has joined
16-08-2018T22:42:58,FoxxTrotter,"G'night, Neko."
16-08-2018T22:43:05,Bgrmystr2,Thanks for streamin Ron
16-08-2018T22:43:10,Deimobos,gnight neko
16-08-2018T22:43:29,SageSaga,No promotions Deimobos
16-08-2018T22:44:33,BadFoMo,Wait until Sage goes AFK.
16-08-2018T22:44:55,Deimobos,no if they say no i cant do it
16-08-2018T22:44:59,BadFoMo,"Sorry, I couldn't help it."
16-08-2018T22:45:07,ZoieFalcona,I would not recommend that
16-08-2018T22:45:21,unsteddyphoenix,Thats a trick anywhere. Sage has eyes EVERYWHERE
16-08-2018T22:46:13,FluffKevlar,well hes not doing it to be a party pooper or something. we've had problems in the past of links leading to phishing or spam/scam
16-08-2018T22:46:33,Deimobos,i need the streamers permission and i want the admins of the chat to join too but if thats not possible its not possible
16-08-2018T22:47:12,BadFoMo,You mean Sage /saw/ me the other night?!
16-08-2018T22:47:14,Bgrmystr2,why are you trying to make a discord server for streamers in the  first place? You think they wouldn't already have a server if they wanted one? xD
16-08-2018T22:47:42,Deimobos,picarto doesnt have a discord as far as i know
16-08-2018T22:48:25,Bgrmystr2,"it might, you don't know"
16-08-2018T22:48:41,Shush,Pretty much every major artist has their own
16-08-2018T22:48:49,Bgrmystr2,"honestly though, does it need one? And for what purpose?"
16-08-2018T22:49:02,ZRO4825,It must exist merely to exist!
16-08-2018T22:49:09,SageSaga,i have 2
16-08-2018T22:49:11,ZRO4825,Kinda like the rumored pair of panties that Nyna owns!
16-08-2018T22:49:23,Deimobos,not many people actually know about picarto
16-08-2018T22:49:24,Bgrmystr2,not that she'd ever wear them zro lolo
16-08-2018T22:49:24,SageSaga,Nyna owns no panties
16-08-2018T22:49:39,ZRO4825,That's why I said rumored! =D
16-08-2018T22:49:53,SageSaga,stop spreading rumors
16-08-2018T22:49:55,ZoieFalcona,"Heh, having a tail is a pain with those :P"
16-08-2018T22:49:57,FluffKevlar,"i have zero, but i really should make one"
16-08-2018T22:50:08,SageSaga,if Nyna is wearing panties its because shes borrowing them from Kaylin
16-08-2018T22:50:22,ZRO4825,More like because Kaylin made her wear them~ lol
16-08-2018T22:50:25,Bgrmystr2,Fluff has zero panties? I am.. not surprised
16-08-2018T22:50:27,Deimobos,and this server is supposed to be for promoting all major picarto artists as well as minor ones
16-08-2018T22:50:28,Bgrmystr2,:v
16-08-2018T22:50:33,SageSaga,Kaylin cant make Nyna do anything
16-08-2018T22:50:53,Deimobos,but i havent found any good advertising sites or servers
16-08-2018T22:50:56,Bgrmystr2,"a discord server is not a great way to do that, Deimo"
16-08-2018T22:51:05,SageSaga,but Kaylin can persuade her to do just about anything :P
16-08-2018T22:51:16,ZoieFalcona,That's good to know :)
16-08-2018T22:51:26,Deimobos,shad did it and so did 4chan
16-08-2018T22:51:35,JamesBSquirrel3,"Hey Fluff. While your done (as SFW), with save as pic. Can you edit exchange for NSFW from previous sucess one?:ptv-wondering:"
16-08-2018T22:52:14,SageSaga,"James, that didnt make much sense"
16-08-2018T22:52:19,Deimobos,and there are tons of servers for promoting furry artists
16-08-2018T22:52:27,FluffKevlar,front page woo
16-08-2018T22:52:56,Bgrmystr2,why do you feel you need to make another one
16-08-2018T22:53:06,ZRO4825,"lol, Fluff doesn't get to be on front page very often :P"
16-08-2018T22:53:14,Bgrmystr2,that's cuz he's not NSFW
16-08-2018T22:53:22,Deimobos,idk maybe its a stupid idea but im going to try my best to help all artists
16-08-2018T22:53:22,Bgrmystr2,front page picarto doesn't show adult streams. Ever.
16-08-2018T22:53:24,FluffKevlar,"James I assume you're asking for a NSFW version of the pic, but no, this is as NSFW as this will get"
16-08-2018T22:53:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"You know, even with as entertaining as the drawing is, all that movement in the corner is a little more distracting"
16-08-2018T22:53:41,JamesBSquirrel3,yeah like that fluff after this
16-08-2018T22:53:43,Bgrmystr2,on which stream kiwi
16-08-2018T22:53:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Both
16-08-2018T22:54:01,Bgrmystr2,I think you may have a distraction problem then lol
16-08-2018T22:54:05,Bgrmystr2,xD

16-08-2018T22:54:39,Deimobos,now i have a distraction
16-08-2018T22:54:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I believe the correct term for that is boner
16-08-2018T22:55:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,oh my
16-08-2018T22:55:09,Deimobos,nah
16-08-2018T22:55:11,Bgrmystr2,"those don't exist on SFW streams, kiwi"
16-08-2018T22:55:31,Deimobos,its not that arousing its just mezmerizing
16-08-2018T22:55:33,ZRO4825,There are many distractions here.
16-08-2018T22:55:45,Bgrmystr2,I'm not distracted by any of the gifs lol
16-08-2018T22:55:50,Bgrmystr2,yall need youkai jesus
16-08-2018T22:56:14,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs more like the constant movement. Draws attention
16-08-2018T22:56:31,ZRO4825,What if not being NSFW is someone's kink? :ptv-wondering:
16-08-2018T22:56:35,Deimobos,you know what im going to contact picarto
16-08-2018T22:56:44,Deimobos,wish me luck
16-08-2018T22:56:58,ZRO4825,Ganbatte~
16-08-2018T22:57:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,what if getting kink shamed is someones kink?
16-08-2018T22:57:33,ZRO4825,Then they should feel bad about their kink. Obviously.

16-08-2018T23:18:30,unsteddyphoenix,What did you do for them?
16-08-2018T23:18:39,Dadrobit,Drove 2 miles.
16-08-2018T23:18:48,Dadrobit,I hate Klondike Bars personally.
16-08-2018T23:18:59,unsteddyphoenix,Are they bad?
16-08-2018T23:19:03,Dadrobit,But sister wants one. So here I am in the froze section.
16-08-2018T23:19:52,Ordithus,"Eat one, for me."
16-08-2018T23:20:05,Dadrobit,They're not bad per se. But they melt so damned fast that you just end up with a messy wrapper full of melted chocolate and ice cream.
16-08-2018T23:20:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Ay
16-08-2018T23:20:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I got some Sherbert tonight myself
16-08-2018T23:20:31,JamesBSquirrel3,At least now those two impress. xd lol:ptv-scratch:
16-08-2018T23:20:38,Bgrmystr2,"they taste pretty good, but can confirm they melt SUPER fast"
16-08-2018T23:20:49,Bgrmystr2,so you gotta eat em fast lol
16-08-2018T23:20:51,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds like youre just complaining about having chocolate and icecream
16-08-2018T23:20:54,Dadrobit,"Then when you try to go in for a lick, you just get melted schmutz in your beard/goatee."
16-08-2018T23:21:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Shave
16-08-2018T23:21:04,unsteddyphoenix,Use a bowl or something

16-08-2018T23:21:24,Bgrmystr2,phoenix do you know what a klondike bar is..?
16-08-2018T23:21:26,FenceEqualizer,Who uses a bowl to eat ice cream sandwiches?
16-08-2018T23:21:34,Ordithus,At least you can eat them :ptv-unimpressed:
16-08-2018T23:21:35,FenceEqualizer,What dark future is that?
16-08-2018T23:21:42,Bgrmystr2,ikr Fence lol
16-08-2018T23:21:58,Bgrmystr2,you can eat them without issue if you don't spend like 5 mins eating the damn thing
16-08-2018T23:22:00,Bgrmystr2,it's ice cream
16-08-2018T23:22:05,Dadrobit,Well it's not like it's even particularly high quality chocolate/ice cream. It's store brand quality.
16-08-2018T23:22:11,Bgrmystr2,it doesn't help that dadro lives in a desert tho
16-08-2018T23:22:31,SageSaga,"James, im not mad or anything at you but you missed the point of what I was saying over and over. Fluff is not allowed to do a NSFW version because he promised not to make one to Tom. So you asking Fluff for a NSFW version is asking him to break a promise"
16-08-2018T23:22:32,Dadrobit,But the novelty of it keeps it going somehow
16-08-2018T23:22:33,Ordithus,"Nice, Sage!"
16-08-2018T23:22:33,SageSaga,understood?
16-08-2018T23:22:58,unsteddyphoenix,Sage there's no way he understands
16-08-2018T23:23:07,SageSaga,if he TRIES he can
16-08-2018T23:23:11,FenceEqualizer,"Not the catchy commercial jingle, Robit?"
16-08-2018T23:23:15,unsteddyphoenix,I highly doubt it
16-08-2018T23:23:23,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah the jingle's all I know about it
16-08-2018T23:23:30,unsteddyphoenix,So it's an icecream sandwich..
16-08-2018T23:23:34,Dadrobit,That's part of the novelty I think.
16-08-2018T23:23:37,Bgrmystr2,I think his understanding of english is worse than his attempts at trying tp type it xD
16-08-2018T23:23:43,Bgrmystr2,to*
16-08-2018T23:23:54,Ordithus,"Eh, James seems to be getting better with English."
16-08-2018T23:24:08,Bgrmystr2,xD Ord
16-08-2018T23:24:11,SageSaga,I agree
16-08-2018T23:24:13,Ordithus,He really does!
16-08-2018T23:24:19,Bgrmystr2,I'm not seein it
16-08-2018T23:24:21,Dadrobit,And it doesn't hold a candle to the Halo Top commercial jingle.
16-08-2018T23:24:26,FenceEqualizer,I mean Ord not wrong.
16-08-2018T23:24:38,unsteddyphoenix,I also do not see it~
16-08-2018T23:24:54,Bgrmystr2,I can't agree w/ it tho Fence sorry :c
16-08-2018T23:25:05,FenceEqualizer,"Huh, maybe We're justgetting better at bot translation"
16-08-2018T23:25:20,FenceEqualizer,Just getting*
16-08-2018T23:25:29,Bgrmystr2,"we're better at understanding, not quite the same"
