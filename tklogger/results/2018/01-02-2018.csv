01-02-2018T00:00:35,unsteddyphoenix,Not safe for anyone
01-02-2018T00:00:50,unsteddyphoenix,These damn scaley directors will be the death of me
01-02-2018T00:01:20,Dadrobit,Lol
01-02-2018T00:02:24,Dadrobit,"Not gonna lie, I honestly asked myself, ""I wonder if this is what scalies imagine it to be like?"""
01-02-2018T00:02:45,Dadrobit,Damned furries and sub-furries sneaking into my shower thoughts.
01-02-2018T00:08:46,unsteddyphoenix,You know the world's messed up when it's getting normalised
01-02-2018T00:08:57,unsteddyphoenix,Utter insanity
01-02-2018T00:11:30,Dadrobit,"No joke, I do wonder ow much it will come to be seen as ""okay"" in the near-ish future by the general populace?"
01-02-2018T00:11:35,Dadrobit,how*
01-02-2018T00:11:50,Dadrobit,"By near-ish, I mean a generation or two."
01-02-2018T00:12:26,unsteddyphoenix,"Considering all the tolerance that's goin' around, it seems inevitable"
01-02-2018T00:14:44,Dadrobit,"And, I mean, look at movies like Zootopia and Rock Dog on top of countless tv cartoons starring anthropomophic cast. There's gonna be an entire generation of adults in a few years that grew up with a huge amount of influence."
01-02-2018T00:15:42,Dadrobit,"SJW bullshittery nonwithstanding, I think there's gonna be a weird surge in furries coming up."
01-02-2018T00:16:35,Dadrobit,"Like, are there gonna be cliques at school? Like the goth kids?"
01-02-2018T00:16:46,Dadrobit,"Disliked, but more or less tolerated?"
01-02-2018T00:17:37,Dadrobit,"I can see it now.... ""Excuse me, we're not a clique, we're a Pack!"""
01-02-2018T00:17:53,unsteddyphoenix,Ooo I can picture that clearly
01-02-2018T00:18:11,unsteddyphoenix,"There's always been things that ""trigger"" furry outbreaks"
01-02-2018T00:18:15,Dadrobit,Let the swirlies commence.
01-02-2018T00:18:37,unsteddyphoenix,Starfox and sonic and junk
01-02-2018T00:18:46,unsteddyphoenix,"Zootopia is a whole different scale though, I guess"
01-02-2018T00:19:15,unsteddyphoenix,More NERDS for the slaughte
01-02-2018T00:19:44,Dadrobit,And the prevalence of availability of the internet and it's weirdness to younger and younger people is gonna have an impact I think.
01-02-2018T00:21:08,Dadrobit,"Like, 20 years ago, if Starfox piqued your interest, you were pretty much stuck with that and whatever other influences were inside your house."
01-02-2018T00:21:38,Dadrobit,"But now, for better or for worse, the entire fandom is just a few google searches away."
01-02-2018T00:21:54,unsteddyphoenix,Tom didnt even know what furries were when he made twokinds
01-02-2018T00:22:24,unsteddyphoenix,Now another kid making a webcomic would learn about them instantly
01-02-2018T00:22:39,Dadrobit,I think I was 15 when I found out from a dude passing out anti-furry propeganda at school. I shit you not.
01-02-2018T00:22:54,unsteddyphoenix,"Woah, seriously? Weird."
01-02-2018T00:23:46,Dadrobit,"Yup, had a club he was putting together. We went out and ""raided"" boards and furry related sites. Not my proudest time as a youth."
01-02-2018T00:24:16,unsteddyphoenix,I feel like I was the only person who had even heard the term in my highschool
01-02-2018T00:24:17,Dadrobit,(I really do feel bad about that actually)
01-02-2018T00:24:25,unsteddyphoenix,And that was only because I found twokinds
01-02-2018T00:24:51,unsteddyphoenix,"Lol what did you even do, call them gay?"
01-02-2018T00:25:21,Dadrobit,"Well, my introduction wasn't exactly kind, but I got over it pretty quick."
01-02-2018T00:25:58,unsteddyphoenix,So you joined the board to troll it and then got indoctrinated?
01-02-2018T00:25:58,Dadrobit,"That's part of it, but he also passed out scripts on flashdrives and instructions on how to DDOS a site to death."
01-02-2018T00:26:18,unsteddyphoenix,"Hoo, dude was dedicated"
01-02-2018T00:26:34,Dadrobit,"Yeah, he was /b/ personified."
01-02-2018T00:27:09,Dadrobit,"And I wouldn't say I'm indoctrinated, I just like it right alongside my normie shit."
01-02-2018T00:27:13,Dadrobit,I'm very moderate.
01-02-2018T00:28:39,unsteddyphoenix,"I feel that, was just EXAGGERATING for COMEDY."
01-02-2018T00:29:21,Dadrobit,"Ohhhhhhhhhhh, I geddit now! :D"
01-02-2018T00:29:33,unsteddyphoenix,"Hey, 'least you have a backstory though I just they were cute"
01-02-2018T00:30:01,unsteddyphoenix,boring~
01-02-2018T00:30:16,Dadrobit,"Ha, funny you call it ""backstory"". Cause I had just broken my back and was looking up webcomics to read because I couldn't do dick all else."
01-02-2018T00:30:33,unsteddyphoenix,Punintentional!
01-02-2018T00:30:42,Dadrobit,\o/
01-02-2018T00:30:46,unsteddyphoenix,"Did you google ""best webcomic"" too?"
01-02-2018T00:31:30,Dadrobit,I think it was a reccomended read from another comic? I was reading a lot of them at the time. But does that legit pull up TK?
01-02-2018T00:32:29,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, this was like....7 years ago"
01-02-2018T00:32:40,unsteddyphoenix,"But it gave me ""topwebcomics.com"" and twokinds was #1 on that so"
01-02-2018T00:32:57,Dadrobit,"Lol, as it has been, so it shall always be."
01-02-2018T00:33:43,unsteddyphoenix,cuteness dominates all else~
01-02-2018T00:33:57,unsteddyphoenix,Oooh it's down to #11 though right now
01-02-2018T00:34:12,unsteddyphoenix,Prob 'cause Tom never puts out incentives anymore since he's already drawing a bunch
01-02-2018T00:34:25,Dadrobit,"Yeah, pretty much."
01-02-2018T00:34:39,Dadrobit,Is Dr. McNinja up there?
01-02-2018T00:35:07,unsteddyphoenix,Doesnt look like it
01-02-2018T00:35:27,Dadrobit,"Sour, not cute enough it would seem."
01-02-2018T00:36:15,unsteddyphoenix,I feel like ive read that before...
01-02-2018T00:36:31,unsteddyphoenix,I read so many webcomics procrastinating my way through highschool that a lot of it's a blur
01-02-2018T00:37:04,Dadrobit,"Huh, only 1300 votes for 1st. Tom could put out a Nibbly sketch and it'd probably hit 11k."
01-02-2018T00:37:47,Dadrobit,I actually let DMN fall by the wayside a while back. I was just thinking of it because it too was a High School procrastination source.
01-02-2018T00:38:36,Dadrobit,Goats (the comic) too. But I think it died anyways sadly.
01-02-2018T00:39:05,unsteddyphoenix,Dead goats :(
01-02-2018T00:43:08,Dadrobit,"Oh damn, he stopped in 2010, then uploaded 3 strips out of the blue in 2017."
01-02-2018T00:43:23,Dadrobit,So I guess I'm caught up?
01-02-2018T00:43:28,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
01-02-2018T00:43:34,unsteddyphoenix,SPEEDREAD
01-02-2018T00:50:59,Dadrobit,"Brb, gonna go make some dinner and probably hit up some Monster Hunter."
01-02-2018T00:52:44,unsteddyphoenix,Good luck with both~
01-02-2018T01:06:42,Dadrobit,Ramen and Tilapia with lemon zest and ghost pepper spice.
01-02-2018T01:07:56,Dadrobit,Pretty good.
01-02-2018T01:09:22,wolfspartan1,goodnight folks
01-02-2018T01:09:59,Dadrobit,cya
01-02-2018T01:10:09,wolfspartan1,bye
01-02-2018T01:12:10,unsteddyphoenix,Lemon zest ramen huh...
01-02-2018T01:15:47,Dadrobit,"I cooked the ramen and the fish together, so it works."
01-02-2018T02:31:07,TheBeckoner,Heyo people.
01-02-2018T05:02:51,TheBeckoner,Goodnighto people.
01-02-2018T07:11:36,PhilTheIdle,Bye
01-02-2018T09:59:35,JaydenMozingo,Did I miss anything last night after I got off?
01-02-2018T10:06:03,JaydenMozingo,I guess my notifications would alert me if he ~was~ on for a stream. nvm
01-02-2018T10:06:30,wolfspartan1,he didn't stream
01-02-2018T10:08:06,JaydenMozingo,I would say that's great but that gives me a bad feeling about his step-father. I could be wrong though (frankly I hope I am)
01-02-2018T10:12:51,wolfspartan1,he might just be busy
01-02-2018T10:13:04,JaydenMozingo,I hope so
01-02-2018T10:13:58,wolfspartan1,me too

01-02-2018T16:08:09,Bgrmystr2,This one is acceptable :point_right:
01-02-2018T16:08:13,Bgrmystr2,but why would you need one
01-02-2018T16:08:25,Bgrmystr2,:gun: this one exists
01-02-2018T16:11:48,TheBeckoner,I suppose...

01-02-2018T17:29:38,Bgrmystr2,"Comic is probably what's happening tonight, but we'll have to wait and see."
01-02-2018T17:30:52,TheBeckoner,"Yes, tonight. I'm curious as to why people never see the provided schedule..."
01-02-2018T17:37:48,WarToWin,idk

01-02-2018T17:55:30,JaydenMozingo,"oh, the schedule. It's the one thing I look at when I need to know when the streams are"
01-02-2018T17:57:03,JaydenMozingo,"Then again, the surprise stream happened, it's all a bit mixed up, but I still follow the schedule"
01-02-2018T17:58:17,JaydenMozingo,"welp, I'm closing out, I'll stay here but Imma do something else"
01-02-2018T17:59:32,JaydenMozingo,sorry I talk too much btw

01-02-2018T18:08:05,wolfspartan1,take a nap lol
01-02-2018T19:21:52,KawaiiFlora,Is Tom streaming today?
01-02-2018T19:24:04,Combak,"He should. He'll be joining SageSaga's stream around 9. Watch his channel to find out if it isn't happening, and why."
01-02-2018T19:25:13,KawaiiFlora,"ah, ok. Thanks"
01-02-2018T19:25:35,Bgrmystr2,"I, too, am unable to see the schedule at the top of the chat every time the page loads. :v"
01-02-2018T19:26:28,KawaiiFlora,I can see the schedule at the top. Dont know why it wouldnt work for you.
01-02-2018T19:27:19,KawaiiFlora,"oh wait, hes streaming at 9 lol"
01-02-2018T19:27:20,Bgrmystr2,It was a joke.
01-02-2018T19:27:25,Bgrmystr2,And you found it.
01-02-2018T19:27:27,Bgrmystr2,Congratulations.
01-02-2018T19:27:31,KawaiiFlora,thought it was 4pm
01-02-2018T19:27:32,Bgrmystr2,:P
01-02-2018T19:27:50,KawaiiFlora,Well I saw it just misread it :/
01-02-2018T19:28:07,Bgrmystr2,You accidentally.
01-02-2018T20:43:00,RandomTKLover,Stream tonight?
01-02-2018T20:44:03,JaydenMozingo,I hope
01-02-2018T20:45:31,PalmettoPathfinder1,"I think Tom might be tired out, since he did just do a bunch of colored pics.  I'm pretty sure his hand must be hurting."
01-02-2018T20:45:55,PalmettoPathfinder1,Of course i could be wrong.
01-02-2018T20:46:05,PalmettoPathfinder1,And he might still be planning on doing a stream tonight.
01-02-2018T20:51:10,Bgrmystr2,you may be wrong palm. This happens every month.
01-02-2018T20:51:44,Bgrmystr2,"Granted he does need to rest his hand sometimes, there was no stream all day thursday"
01-02-2018T20:51:50,Bgrmystr2,and we don't know what he was doing
01-02-2018T20:51:56,Bgrmystr2,there wasn't any stream wed either.
01-02-2018T20:52:13,TheFDdriver,"hello, and you right"
01-02-2018T20:52:24,Combak,"Well, Sage's stream is empty except for Mihari, so..."
01-02-2018T20:52:29,Combak,Waiting time!
01-02-2018T20:52:59,TheFDdriver,i dont really care waiting
01-02-2018T20:57:02,qwe304,"since a lot of people in the comics folowing are relatively new (including myself) i am compiling a list of alterations made when tom has gone back and changed art on pages, most are insignificant, but there are a few noteworthy changes"
01-02-2018T20:58:26,Combak,BadFoMo has you beat on that front @qwe304.
01-02-2018T20:58:29,TheFDdriver,"thats always interesting, since that tells you how his art style changed"
01-02-2018T20:58:40,qwe304,"dang, really?"
01-02-2018T20:58:52,BadFoMo,@Combak I do?
01-02-2018T20:59:02,Combak,Is it just errors?
01-02-2018T20:59:12,Combak,Or maybe I'm thinking of someone else...
01-02-2018T20:59:25,qwe304,"no, im compileing a list of changes besides errors"
01-02-2018T20:59:39,BadFoMo,Cool.
01-02-2018T20:59:48,qwe304,and subtle art changes

01-02-2018T22:01:52,qwe304,im curious how the reproductive organs of flowers relate to what i assume in an anime
01-02-2018T22:02:17,Unenlagia,The mecha are all named after flowers and have paired male and female pilots
01-02-2018T22:03:06,PalmettoPathfinder1,Hm....Interesting.  I'm putting that on my list of mecha anime for me to watch.
01-02-2018T22:03:17,CrRAR,"Like Yin and Yang, complementary pairs."
01-02-2018T22:03:26,CrRAR,so...Zen~
