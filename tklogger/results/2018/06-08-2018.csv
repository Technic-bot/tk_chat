06-08-2018T00:00:34,TheGamePlayer,"OMG sorry to here night, I missed alot while I was gone"
06-08-2018T00:00:36,NightMeaty22,My dad is both
06-08-2018T00:00:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"You’re dad is a boss, not a dad"
06-08-2018T00:00:47,Bgrmystr2,There's a thing called a standard. Laws and worker's rights create that standard.
06-08-2018T00:00:55,SpazztasticKiwi,That man is not a leader
06-08-2018T00:01:44,Bgrmystr2,"how late do you work, Night?"
06-08-2018T00:03:01,NightMeaty22,"Ok my dad teaches me how to fix drywall clean pant but once i have ""learned"" things get diffrent"
06-08-2018T00:03:36,NightMeaty22,My work time is random
06-08-2018T00:04:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"That’s where the “appropriate compensation” comes in. That doesn’t exist, so he is no leader"
06-08-2018T00:05:23,TheGamePlayer,Ugh why do people leave coffee sitting out at 12am??? And I have to clean it up... I guess that's what I get for being up so late
06-08-2018T00:05:48,Bgrmystr2,you're not supposed to work more than 3 hours on a school day at the ages of 14 and 15
06-08-2018T00:05:59,Bgrmystr2,I'm betting you do.
06-08-2018T00:06:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"Although if you don’t believe me when I say what he is doing is illegal and blatant abuse, hows this for evidence: my father was an abusive alcoholic. I know what it’s like, and I know what it looks like."
06-08-2018T00:06:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you don’t say something, it’s just going to get worse"
06-08-2018T00:06:47,TheGamePlayer,"I was just told this by the guy offering me a job, no work that exceeds 3 hours on school day."
06-08-2018T00:07:18,Ordithus,Also a minimum of 8 hours between shifts
06-08-2018T00:08:16,TheGamePlayer,"Off topic kinda, he told me I'd work one random week night, Friday and weekendns"
06-08-2018T00:08:30,Bgrmystr2,you can't work past 7pm from Labor Day to June 1st and past 9pm from June 1st to Labor Day
06-08-2018T00:08:35,NightMeaty22,Ok i guess i shouldn't have said any thing cuz now this conversation has gone from simple complaining/talking to you telling me how to live my life
06-08-2018T00:08:52,NightMeaty22,Btw i am not in school yet
06-08-2018T00:08:57,Ordithus,Summer?
06-08-2018T00:09:32,Bgrmystr2,"This is not telling you how to live your life, mate."
06-08-2018T00:09:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"Again, difference between complaining and revealing what should never be considered normal or ok"
06-08-2018T00:09:40,Bgrmystr2,It's saying your life is wrong.
06-08-2018T00:09:47,NightMeaty22,Thats what it feels like
06-08-2018T00:10:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"And from what it sounds like, he’s the one dictating how you live your life"
06-08-2018T00:10:12,Ordithus,"This isn't easy, but it's important"
06-08-2018T00:10:33,NightMeaty22,And wrong for other people is normal for some
06-08-2018T00:10:55,Bgrmystr2,"No, Night. Don't excuse illegal acts just because he's family"
06-08-2018T00:10:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Nope™️
06-08-2018T00:10:58,Bgrmystr2,That's bullshit
06-08-2018T00:11:00,Ordithus,Let's not go down that dark road
06-08-2018T00:14:00,NightMeaty22,Ok just cause my dad is my boss and tells me to do things and can get angry doesnt make him a bad person he is my dad
06-08-2018T00:14:32,NightMeaty22,Yes he is a crapy boss
06-08-2018T00:15:24,Bgrmystr2,You clearly do not know. People tell others to do things all the time. People get angry all the time. Neither of those make anyone a bad person.
06-08-2018T00:15:35,Bgrmystr2,HOW they do it is what makes them who they are.
06-08-2018T00:15:49,Bgrmystr2,and you don't get to make excuses for that.
06-08-2018T00:15:56,NightMeaty22,But if i am willing to do the work is it illegal
06-08-2018T00:16:13,Bgrmystr2,"Yes, it is, that's the whole point of having laws."
06-08-2018T00:16:39,NightMeaty22,I am not forced to work
06-08-2018T00:16:58,Bgrmystr2,Doesn't matter.
06-08-2018T00:17:25,Bgrmystr2,"The very fact that you think it's okay what happens to you is a problem to begin with.,"
06-08-2018T00:17:30,Ordithus,"You do complain about your job and dad most every time you chat.  which the complaining is OK, we don't mind.  We will respond though, don't just expect others to listen and not say anything"
06-08-2018T00:17:34,NightMeaty22,So if i want to work that makes it illegal
06-08-2018T00:18:11,Bgrmystr2,No. Him employing you when he's the one responsible to NOT do so is what is illegal.
06-08-2018T00:18:21,Bgrmystr2,The law stands as-is.
06-08-2018T00:18:29,Bgrmystr2,"If you didn't read it, I suggest you do so."
06-08-2018T00:18:57,Bgrmystr2,though I guess that's a pointless endeavor.
06-08-2018T00:21:24,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, it's not going to make any difference who you talk to, because most everyone will tell you the same thing. Not because we're bad people, but because it's for your own safety, and to make your life better."
06-08-2018T00:21:33,NightMeaty22,I work for my family busines so...
06-08-2018T00:22:03,Ordithus,Still a business subject to the same laws.  Chores are different from work
06-08-2018T00:22:38,Bgrmystr2,"technically, chores can still be seen as work, Ord, depending on what it is"
06-08-2018T00:22:55,Bgrmystr2,"though for the most part, they wouldn't be"
06-08-2018T00:23:54,Ordithus,"Well, technically Mulan isn't a princess, but that doesn't stop Disney! (ok that was random)"
06-08-2018T00:24:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"Drywall work and construction isn’t chores, too"
06-08-2018T00:24:21,Bgrmystr2,"exactly, kiwi"
06-08-2018T00:24:40,Bgrmystr2,nor would be things like making clothing or things like that
06-08-2018T00:25:10,NightMeaty22,Just because i have a job working for myself and the rest of my family laws are broken beacuse my dad is in a way my boss
06-08-2018T00:25:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"And “family business” means the other siblings are involved too, especially if they’re older"
06-08-2018T00:25:31,TheGamePlayer,"I only help building because either they REALLY need help or I have nothing to do, and we have one cabin to knock down and three to remodel"
06-08-2018T00:25:41,Bgrmystr2,"Night, you seem to not even have understood"
06-08-2018T00:26:00,Bgrmystr2,why am I not surprisedd..
06-08-2018T00:27:17,Ordithus,"He's also been up since 3, reading comprehension kinda can tnk"
06-08-2018T00:27:20,Ordithus,*tank
06-08-2018T00:27:40,Ordithus,Especially of something like law *shudders*
06-08-2018T00:27:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Also you claimed a little earlier you’re not forced to work but you’ve also mentioned he’s made you work through migraines and when you didn’t want to
06-08-2018T00:28:06,Bgrmystr2,"exactly, kiwi"
06-08-2018T00:28:17,TheGamePlayer,Not good
06-08-2018T00:28:22,Ordithus,That could just be being a shit boss
06-08-2018T00:28:39,Bgrmystr2,it's a different story when the worker is a kid though
06-08-2018T00:29:04,Bgrmystr2,two very different stories
06-08-2018T00:29:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Dude. I have high levels of anxiety. My managers know this. I am allowed to stop working and so sit down if I need to whenever
06-08-2018T00:29:29,SpazztasticKiwi,*go
06-08-2018T00:29:30,TheGamePlayer,"Well I can relate to bad headache or sickness, but if it's an ""all hands on deck"" I'm working for at least an hour or two"
06-08-2018T00:30:07,NightMeaty22,Thanks for taking this all the wrong way i have a job i dont have a problem with it i just get frustrated by whats going on i did not ask of all this crap yes i have to work with migraines but so do many other people look i just wish i hadnt said any thin
06-08-2018T00:30:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you can work through it, go for it, but there’s a point where it’d be better to take a break"
06-08-2018T00:30:40,NightMeaty22,Sorry for causing you problems with my lofe
06-08-2018T00:30:47,NightMeaty22,Life*
06-08-2018T00:30:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Not a problem at all
06-08-2018T00:31:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Not for us. I’m up anyway. And I’m happy to listen
06-08-2018T00:31:23,Bgrmystr2,That's the thing Night. We're not the ones with problems with your life.
06-08-2018T00:31:25,TheGamePlayer,Just wanted to help but I guess we may have overstepped
06-08-2018T00:31:25,Bgrmystr2,You are.
06-08-2018T00:31:32,Bgrmystr2,We're trying to help you solve them
06-08-2018T00:32:01,Ordithus,"You didn't cause any problems, sorry that we're all ""let's solve this now!"""
06-08-2018T00:32:02,NightMeaty22,Forcing laws in my face is not what i call helping bgr
06-08-2018T00:33:12,Bgrmystr2,I'm not forcing anything. You're the one that came here to a public chat. I happened to be here to respond
06-08-2018T00:33:18,Bgrmystr2,:c

06-08-2018T00:34:04,Ordithus,"I know, you can't help it"
06-08-2018T00:34:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh I never said hi to y’all when you popped in
06-08-2018T00:34:20,SpazztasticKiwi,So Hiiiiiii

06-08-2018T00:35:27,Ordithus,"Hi Game, hi bunny rabbit... geez I'm tired"
06-08-2018T00:35:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Well I’ve noticed sometimes there’s a hello train and other times you just shuffle in with the flow
06-08-2018T00:35:38,TheGamePlayer,Hey how bought Fallout 76 or battlefield 5
06-08-2018T00:36:10,TheGamePlayer,Anyone going to play them?

06-08-2018T00:36:43,Ordithus,"video games, anyways"

06-08-2018T00:47:53,TheGamePlayer,XD I just found someone with the gamertag TwoKinds on Xbox
06-08-2018T00:48:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m sure there’s a few
06-08-2018T00:48:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you’re a fan of something and don’t want to use your name, why not"
06-08-2018T00:48:40,TheGamePlayer,Gamer score of 0 and has been offline for whoever knows how long
06-08-2018T00:49:01,Bgrmystr2,mebbe it's tom :thinking:
06-08-2018T00:49:16,TheGamePlayer,Added them as a friend
06-08-2018T00:49:41,TheGamePlayer,I was thinking it could be Tom
06-08-2018T00:50:52,TheGamePlayer,Someone on my friends list has Fidget as their gamer pic and by the name of superwolf23er
06-08-2018T00:51:04,TheGamePlayer,Very interesting
06-08-2018T00:51:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Well Tom has mentioned a liking for some of those games...
06-08-2018T00:51:28,SpazztasticKiwi,No telling how much he’s actually on tho
06-08-2018T00:52:14,TheGamePlayer,Oh it's a female avatar
06-08-2018T00:52:22,TheGamePlayer,Sooo no it's not him
06-08-2018T00:53:03,TheGamePlayer,And only has one friend
06-08-2018T00:53:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Or he used a female avatar to throw people off
06-08-2018T00:53:37,TheGamePlayer,Maybe
06-08-2018T00:53:41,Dadrobit,"Yeah, older bro fell off the top of a two story house once. And I refractureed my T5 vertibrae doing heavy lifting. Accidents happen I guess. But shit happens ya know?"
06-08-2018T00:53:48,Dadrobit,Whisper fail
06-08-2018T00:54:06,TheGamePlayer,Lol
06-08-2018T00:54:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Was that the back thing that got you in a helicopter?
06-08-2018T00:54:17,TheGamePlayer,Happens
06-08-2018T00:54:26,TheGamePlayer,Also are you ok?!?
06-08-2018T00:54:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Nm
06-08-2018T00:54:49,Bgrmystr2,"no, dadro died"
06-08-2018T00:54:50,Dadrobit,"No, I broke my back dirtbiking. I refractured one of the vertibrae not long after when I was helping remodel a house with my dad."
06-08-2018T00:55:01,TheGamePlayer,"That lol was to ""whisper faill"" not getting hurt sorry"
06-08-2018T00:55:03,Bgrmystr2,we are now speaking to his ghost
06-08-2018T00:55:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"So the accident with the helicopter happened, then you refractories it doing the heavy lifting...?"
06-08-2018T00:55:27,Dadrobit,"Lol, no worries, I tell all my injuries as funny stories."
06-08-2018T00:55:29,Bgrmystr2,"""Refractories"" xD"
06-08-2018T00:55:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, how’d your bother fare from his fall? Pop back up?"
06-08-2018T00:56:01,Dadrobit,Correct. I was throwing around some roof tiles and cracked one trying to hoss on a full pack.
06-08-2018T00:56:41,Dadrobit,"Yeah, he tried to hop back up. Then went straight down.... He got better though. Serves as a Sgt. now."
06-08-2018T00:57:01,TheGamePlayer,Hardcore free-for-all is my jam I will dominate the enemy.
06-08-2018T00:57:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Reaction to falling two stories - get back up and walk it off
06-08-2018T00:57:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Seems legit
06-08-2018T00:57:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Totally safe
06-08-2018T00:57:28,TheGamePlayer,Glad he's ok
06-08-2018T00:57:37,Dadrobit,Same reaction to biffing it going almost 90 mph on a disrt bike.
06-08-2018T00:57:42,TheGamePlayer,I'll be back time to win this game
06-08-2018T00:57:54,Dadrobit,"""I'm okay, I'm okay.... Fuck"""
06-08-2018T00:58:14,SpazztasticKiwi,“ don’t think you’re going to be doing any of that soon”
06-08-2018T00:58:40,TheGamePlayer,Keeping chat open
06-08-2018T00:59:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"Hasn’t anyone told you “if you suspect the possibility of a spinal injury, stay the fuck down and don’t move”"
06-08-2018T00:59:10,Bgrmystr2,"lolol ""I'm okay.. ow.. alright I'm not okay."""
06-08-2018T00:59:58,Bgrmystr2,"yeah that's kind of the standard kiwi, but I don't think most ppl would even know if it's a spinal injury or not"
06-08-2018T01:00:12,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I was a Boy Scout remember? That's why I eventually conceded to the fact that I was fucked up real bad and waited for the medical sandrail to get to me."
06-08-2018T01:00:50,Dadrobit,And yeah. The prospect of a broken back was totally not even something I considered until I got the doctors tellin me what happened.
06-08-2018T01:01:12,SpazztasticKiwi,If you *suspect* the injury don’t move. In any way. At all
06-08-2018T01:01:34,Dadrobit,"As far as I knew, I sprained an ankle, and broke some ribs. Nothing bad though."
06-08-2018T01:01:55,Dadrobit,"Oh, and dislocated a shoulder, I knew that. That sucked."
06-08-2018T01:01:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"If it’s not, so you laid down for a bit longer, but if there was something, oh boy"
06-08-2018T01:02:08,Dadrobit,"Ironically, that was the least of the worries irl."
06-08-2018T01:02:27,Dadrobit,Adrenaline is a Hell of a drug.
06-08-2018T01:02:43,Bgrmystr2,far as I know.. if you take damage and suddenly can't move your body lower than where you got hurt.. it may be related to your spine.
06-08-2018T01:02:58,Bgrmystr2,Maybe.
06-08-2018T01:03:00,Dadrobit,"""I'm 15! I'm invincible!"""
06-08-2018T01:03:07,Bgrmystr2,xD
06-08-2018T01:03:08,SpazztasticKiwi,One of the top things they reiterated to us in CPR/First Aid/Emergency Assistance
06-08-2018T01:03:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"“Unless something’s about to explode or is on fire nearby, do not let them move”"
06-08-2018T01:04:25,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I know. But when you're in something like that, just lying there is the last thing your body wants to do. It wants to get up and reinforce the idea that ""I'm not dead"""
06-08-2018T01:04:31,TheGamePlayer,I said I'd win but I didn't I'm sorry I lied
06-08-2018T01:05:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"“I’m ok, I swear, look - I’m moving!”"
06-08-2018T01:05:19,Dadrobit,Exactly.
06-08-2018T01:05:27,Dadrobit,"You joke, but that's exactly the mentality."
06-08-2018T01:06:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"I know. I had my wisdom teeth removed and I was told bed rest, especially right after the sleep gas"
06-08-2018T01:06:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"Not the same, but lemme tell you, that is not what I did"
06-08-2018T01:07:00,Dadrobit,"Then when I was done assuring myself that I was still alive, I laid back down. All happened even before the first person was able to get to me."
06-08-2018T01:07:20,Dadrobit,Believe it or not. Was my physics teacher.
06-08-2018T01:07:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"Next time, try just checking your pulse"
06-08-2018T01:07:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Or look for the white light
06-08-2018T01:08:07,Dadrobit,The sand in the sun looks rather white. I'd rather not give myself the wrong idea.
06-08-2018T01:08:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Theoretically there won’t be a next time but you did say you’ve already refractured it so
06-08-2018T01:08:55,Dadrobit,My teacher did not let me live it down in class later on. Used me as an example. Was some funny shit tbh.
06-08-2018T01:09:14,SpazztasticKiwi,“Don’t be stupid.....like Dadro here”
06-08-2018T01:09:59,Bgrmystr2,xDD
06-08-2018T01:10:01,Dadrobit,"""If dadro is riding his bike at 87 mph and leaves it in a crash where his height is 4 feet, how far will he go before he lands?"""
06-08-2018T01:10:44,Bgrmystr2,hahaha
06-08-2018T01:10:54,Bgrmystr2,bout 5 miles to the nearest ICU
06-08-2018T01:10:56,Dadrobit,"""His body bounces and is now only traveling at 40 mph at the apex of the bounce of 2.3 feet, how far does he go until he lands again?"""
06-08-2018T01:11:44,Bgrmystr2,"did he finish with ""Dadro was not harmed in this math problem"""
06-08-2018T01:11:46,Dadrobit,He was chill though. Helped make the physics club. We made a trebuchet. It was lit.
06-08-2018T01:11:49,Bgrmystr2,"cuz if not, abuse D:"
06-08-2018T01:12:11,Dadrobit,"Oh hell no, everyone in the school knew. I was in a giant plastic shell for a good month."
06-08-2018T01:12:31,Bgrmystr2,jeez
06-08-2018T01:12:43,Bgrmystr2,seems like you're doin good tho now
06-08-2018T01:13:17,Dadrobit,"More or less. Shit sucks, but you gotta laugh you know?"
06-08-2018T01:13:35,Bgrmystr2,yup
06-08-2018T01:14:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I know one boy in my high school a grade above me that was gone for a few days. Car accident. Came back wearing a c collar for a few weeks
06-08-2018T01:14:33,SpazztasticKiwi,He rolled his truck. At like 70ish
06-08-2018T01:14:53,Bgrmystr2,how many times did it roll?
06-08-2018T01:14:57,Bgrmystr2,and did it land on it's wheels?
06-08-2018T01:15:04,Bgrmystr2,do you know? ;u
06-08-2018T01:15:06,Dadrobit,https://imgur.com/Uz7eE7n The trebuchet made an appearance in our club T-shirt. Was good time.
06-08-2018T01:15:34,Bgrmystr2,thumbs up BLOCKS the trebuchet &gt;:T
06-08-2018T01:15:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"Not many details were given. I think he was in trouble for possibly speeding, which may have caused it"
06-08-2018T01:15:45,Bgrmystr2,"not the best placement, but cool shirt nonetheless"
06-08-2018T01:16:12,SpazztasticKiwi,It was either speeding or he was “may be on his phone”
06-08-2018T01:16:23,Bgrmystr2,how is 70mph not speeding
06-08-2018T01:16:27,Bgrmystr2,was he on a highway
06-08-2018T01:16:29,Bgrmystr2,xD
06-08-2018T01:16:40,TheGamePlayer,I won
06-08-2018T01:17:16,Bgrmystr2,"far as I recall, the higest is 65? federal highways. May be mis-remembering though"
06-08-2018T01:17:23,TheGamePlayer,21 kills and 7 deaths
06-08-2018T01:17:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I know. I’m pretty convinced of the speeding. But there’s always that one “it was those blasted phones!”
06-08-2018T01:17:51,Bgrmystr2,"the phone had nothin to do with it, tis the user that's lookin at the phone"
06-08-2018T01:18:03,Dadrobit,75 is as high as I've seen.
06-08-2018T01:18:22,Dadrobit,"""Reasonable and Prudent"" used to be a thing as well. At least in Illinois."
06-08-2018T01:18:44,SpazztasticKiwi,It was a backroad. I know Colin was suspected of being on his phone when he crashed too but it turned out to be that he fell asleep before he hit that tree
06-08-2018T01:19:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Tree snapped in half. Landed on the driver’s side. Crushed instantly
06-08-2018T01:22:12,Bgrmystr2,:/
06-08-2018T01:22:22,Bgrmystr2,trees don't fuck around
06-08-2018T01:22:30,Bgrmystr2,"if you hit them, they will hit you back"
06-08-2018T01:22:41,Bgrmystr2,"and more often than not, they'll fucking win."
06-08-2018T01:22:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"But Allen? Too fast. Curve in road. Do a barrel roll, and end up in c collar"
06-08-2018T01:24:18,Dadrobit,"Saguaros. Like trees, but angrier. https://i.imgur.com/YzMwtY4.jpg"
06-08-2018T01:24:46,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s got a wife with a bun in the oven now I believe
06-08-2018T01:25:52,SpazztasticKiwi,“Angrier”? What a..... prick 😏
06-08-2018T01:30:55,TheGamePlayer,I feel like using the S-mines in CoD:WWII is a cheap thing to do but I do it so I was going somewhere with this but not anymore
06-08-2018T01:33:02,Bgrmystr2,Aieeyaa Dadro I think that car got the point
06-08-2018T01:33:13,Bgrmystr2,"also, +1 to kiwi xD"
06-08-2018T01:33:47,TheGamePlayer,"And as soon as I type that I now know others struggles of getting around without hearing the ""ka-click""...""BOOM"""
06-08-2018T01:38:12,TheGamePlayer,Also Good night every one
06-08-2018T02:47:56,SiliconCarbide,"im pretty sure I saw 80 mph speedlimits in utah, was the highest I came across"
06-08-2018T10:53:32,TheBeckoner,In Texas heading towards Dallas or Austin the roads are normally 75mph for a good part of the drive
06-08-2018T10:54:13,TheBeckoner,"very few cops on those big highways too, which means a lot of people do like 90 or a 100"
06-08-2018T12:28:12,Twokinds,(&gt;'')&gt;
06-08-2018T12:28:54,iliar,"Good morning, Tom."
06-08-2018T12:57:55,TheGamePlayer,Looks like Tom needs a huge?
06-08-2018T13:00:17,TheGamePlayer,Also Gmorning
06-08-2018T13:46:13,PhilTheIdle,How does Tom the shadows?
06-08-2018T14:12:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Eh. Just get him a mug of coffee. Just as warm as a hug
06-08-2018T14:14:11,SpazztasticKiwi,☕️ &lt;(“&lt;)
06-08-2018T14:14:15,PhilTheIdle,How does that help?
06-08-2018T14:14:44,TorqueEmUp,I always just saw that emoji as Kirby. :P
06-08-2018T14:14:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Well none of us are close enough to give any hugs so coffee is gonna have to be the answer
06-08-2018T14:15:22,TorqueEmUp,"Well out of everyone here I am probably the closest, but I don't think Tom wants a hug from me. :P"
06-08-2018T14:15:46,PhilTheIdle,I'd like to be hugged by Maeve.
06-08-2018T14:16:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"If that message was about a hug, that is"
06-08-2018T14:17:48,TorqueEmUp,"Right, he could just be playing Kirby on his Switch or something. For all we know."
06-08-2018T14:20:58,SpazztasticKiwi,One of the best feelings I know - opening fresh contacts
06-08-2018T14:39:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I get a day off and Bagheera acts like I’ve been gone to another country
06-08-2018T15:02:49,TheGamePlayer,"@TwoKinds do you have a Xbox live account? I found a TwoKinds on Xbox so I'm wondering, zero games and one friend"
06-08-2018T15:17:42,Twokinds,Nope
06-08-2018T15:35:53,TheGamePlayer,Ok just wanted to make sure
06-08-2018T15:40:59,SpazztasticKiwi,My sim is pregnant. I have no names
06-08-2018T15:41:20,TheGamePlayer,Female or male?
06-08-2018T15:41:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t know yet but I want a boy
06-08-2018T15:41:45,TheGamePlayer,Then Vincent
06-08-2018T15:42:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Vincent Richards
06-08-2018T15:42:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Not bad. I’d thought Eric
06-08-2018T15:42:20,TheGamePlayer,Sure
06-08-2018T15:42:37,TheGamePlayer,Ehhh idk about Eric

06-08-2018T19:17:44,CrRAR,haha
06-08-2018T21:18:55,Dadrobit,Filiberto's is going to ruin me.
06-08-2018T21:19:00,Dadrobit,"Tasty, tasty ruin!"
06-08-2018T22:20:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I got chocolate cake 🍰
06-08-2018T23:15:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom you ever had knock you naked brownies before?
06-08-2018T23:17:26,TorqueEmUp,I've never even heard of them until now.
06-08-2018T23:18:51,TheGamePlayer,"XD I'm dying there's this guy on YouTube that does all these voices from ""Family Guy"" to Pennywise it's so hilarious lmao"
06-08-2018T23:22:20,TheGamePlayer,His name is Azerrz

06-08-2018T23:25:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Basically diabetes in a pan
06-08-2018T23:26:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh and you sprinkle powdered sugar on top when they cool
06-08-2018T23:29:55,TheGamePlayer,So I nd yummy
06-08-2018T23:31:28,TheGamePlayer,"I made a diabetes cake, it was a giant 🍪 with sprinkles, m&m, whipped cream, and marshmallows."
06-08-2018T23:32:11,TheGamePlayer,Oh and of course chocolate chips
