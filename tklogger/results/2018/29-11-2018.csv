29-11-2018T00:04:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Whatever bounces your Nibbly :ctwokinds-nibsdance:
29-11-2018T00:07:01,Vatruvius,"I am curious, what sort of story arch do all of you prefer the most personally?"
29-11-2018T00:12:28,totallynotTrace,"honestly i find ""hero saves the day"" boring. So much so that if a story is only about the hero definately saving the day because he is say better than everyone else (ie superhuman) i just avoid it"
29-11-2018T00:12:49,Ordithus,"I like many different stories.  Redemption, bittersweet stories, hope-against-all-odds sort of stories... especially when there's character growth"
29-11-2018T00:13:19,totallynotTrace,i agree with ord
29-11-2018T00:13:45,totallynotTrace,like lets take the basitin island adventure
29-11-2018T00:14:00,Ordithus,The odd romance is good too :ctwokinds-traceflohug:
29-11-2018T00:14:49,totallynotTrace,"yeah sure trace helped save the basitins, but with the help and sacrifice of others so it was bittersweet so it wasnt too cliche"
29-11-2018T00:15:10,Vatruvius,"I simply trying to size up where my comic currently stands to what you guys are saying. I never expected this, but I have found it increasingly difficult to find a way for my protagonist, the hero, to actually do something that makes sense."
29-11-2018T00:15:39,Vatruvius,"What I have come up with turns the comic, in the very end, into a strong message."
29-11-2018T00:15:50,Vatruvius,"The hero wins, but not completely."
29-11-2018T00:15:58,Vatruvius,A...remorseful win if it were.
29-11-2018T00:16:49,totallynotTrace,OOOooh you have my interest
29-11-2018T00:17:26,Vatruvius,"Well, I guess I have that to support my slightly unsure view."
29-11-2018T00:17:37,Ordithus,"Not all is well.  ""Couldn't save everyone"" sort of thing?"
29-11-2018T00:17:51,Vatruvius,"Don't get me wrong, the story in of itself is very interesting through and through, I am just slightly worried about the ending."
29-11-2018T00:18:04,Vatruvius,"It has romance in it, loss, world building, etc."
29-11-2018T00:18:51,Bgrmystr2,"the best way to figure out what your hero would do, vatru"
29-11-2018T00:19:03,Bgrmystr2,is to find someone you know that thinks the same way the hero does.
29-11-2018T00:19:23,Vatruvius,"Okay, so who else thinks like me?"
29-11-2018T00:19:33,Vatruvius,XD
29-11-2018T00:19:35,Bgrmystr2,"lolo, I mean like.."
29-11-2018T00:19:42,Bgrmystr2,base someone else in the shoes of your hero'
29-11-2018T00:20:03,Bgrmystr2,"find something that would be valuable to them, even if it's not valuable to you, yourself"
29-11-2018T00:20:13,Vatruvius,I do not have a plethora of individuals to chose from that could be the protagonist.
29-11-2018T00:20:20,Vatruvius,Hmm...
29-11-2018T00:20:26,Vatruvius,"See, I do have that."
29-11-2018T00:20:46,Vatruvius,And her actions makes sense and really compares two different views on a topic.
29-11-2018T00:21:10,Bgrmystr2,"it's just a matter of finding out what other people would do in that sort of situation rather than what you would do, and it opens up a lot of possibilities for the hero to not be so based on the creator themselves."
29-11-2018T00:21:25,Bgrmystr2,"a lot of people base the hero on themselves, and it just turns into this kind of semi-self-insert"
29-11-2018T00:21:26,Vatruvius,"The end of the comic picks which view is best, so to speak. But, it is not a complete ending. Like...there is no way I can describe this without spoiling the ending."
29-11-2018T00:21:30,Vatruvius,Which I do not want to do.
29-11-2018T00:22:12,Vatruvius,"Oh, yeah she is not like me. Similar but different for sure."
29-11-2018T00:22:47,Vatruvius,I just do not want the story to be so invigorating as I see it to have an ending that readers would feel to be a little flat.
29-11-2018T00:23:00,Vatruvius,"I do not know, I have to work on it more and build it up."
29-11-2018T00:24:16,totallynotTrace,sounds like the right thing to do
29-11-2018T00:26:40,Ordithus,Keep at it!  Make something you're proud of
29-11-2018T00:28:37,Vatruvius,"I will, it is just difficult to find a way for my protagonist to fight the antagonist in a way that makes sense to her character and my universe. This is why I said rewriting my universe is not off the table. I just feel very limited in possibilities."
29-11-2018T00:38:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I leave for five minutes for pizza bites...
29-11-2018T00:39:57,Vatruvius,"That sounds good, speaking of which I am going to whip up some spaghetti."

29-11-2018T00:50:26,Bgrmystr2,ah gnight ord
29-11-2018T00:50:36,Vatruvius,Goodnight Ord.
29-11-2018T01:15:26,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
29-11-2018T01:16:21,Vatruvius,Goodnight Tom!
29-11-2018T01:16:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Night Tom
29-11-2018T01:18:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m gonna join that movement 🛌
29-11-2018T01:23:14,Vatruvius,Night Kiwi.
29-11-2018T01:41:41,Vatruvius,I am going to bed as well. Goodnight everyone! :ptv-greetings:
29-11-2018T02:18:50,Bgrmystr2,I'm not. :u
29-11-2018T03:02:48,Vatruvius,And I'm back!
29-11-2018T03:02:57,Vatruvius,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:
29-11-2018T03:06:12,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: quick sleep is quick.
29-11-2018T03:07:14,Vatruvius,Wasn't even a sleep. I have been working on writing my comic the entire time and it is still frustrating me! Agh!
29-11-2018T03:07:43,Vatruvius,I feel like a really good screaming would make me feel better but would not help my voice so I will settle with a Reni scream.
29-11-2018T03:07:51,Vatruvius,:ctwokinds-renirawr::ctwokinds-renirawr::ctwokinds-renirawr:
29-11-2018T03:08:42,Vatruvius,"That aside, I have concluded that I really need to settle on a history from which my villain came from in order to determine the story. There is just too many variables without a more fixed setting."
29-11-2018T03:09:10,Bgrmystr2,"she's... not really screaming in that image, just summoning fire from the depths"
29-11-2018T03:09:19,Vatruvius,Exactly...
29-11-2018T03:09:29,Bgrmystr2,not really the same though
29-11-2018T03:09:40,Vatruvius,:ctwokinds-eyeroll:
29-11-2018T03:09:42,Bgrmystr2,I guess either one would apply for you though.
29-11-2018T03:10:45,Vatruvius,"I am calling it write now, somehow in a month or two all this will be scrapped save for the characters maybe."
29-11-2018T03:10:49,Vatruvius,right*
29-11-2018T03:10:53,Vatruvius,Jesus it is late.
29-11-2018T03:11:29,Bgrmystr2,"you are misleading, you said you'd be going to bed. Then you didn't! What else could you bamboozle me with?"
29-11-2018T03:11:52,Vatruvius,"Poor phrasing on my part, I should have said I was getting off."
29-11-2018T03:12:02,Bgrmystr2,aw how boring
29-11-2018T03:12:09,Bgrmystr2,I was expecting more bamboozle
29-11-2018T03:12:11,Bgrmystr2,:u
29-11-2018T03:12:12,Vatruvius,lol
29-11-2018T03:12:18,Bgrmystr2,mebbe next time lol
29-11-2018T03:12:25,Vatruvius,Perhaps.
29-11-2018T03:12:50,Vatruvius,"Here is something perplexing you that could bamboozle you, or stump you at least."
29-11-2018T03:13:12,Vatruvius,...
29-11-2018T03:13:39,Vatruvius,"Excuse poor grammar, brain is tired from college application paragraphs."
29-11-2018T03:14:15,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-shock: you were right, that statement is bamboozling indeed!"
29-11-2018T03:14:26,Vatruvius,lol
29-11-2018T03:14:29,Vatruvius,Not that one.
29-11-2018T03:14:42,Bgrmystr2,:U
29-11-2018T03:15:48,Vatruvius,"So, you have a protagonist and an antagonist. The antagonist is the complex bad guy who did bad things but are they? That aside, the protagonist does not use violence or come from violence, she believes in people and lives in a world of semi-peace."
29-11-2018T03:15:58,Vatruvius,There are no warring peoples.
29-11-2018T03:16:37,Vatruvius,"So how is she to fight and overcome said antagonist who, in his past, has used violence and was raised in a violent past?"
29-11-2018T03:17:40,Vatruvius,Are you bamboozled now/
29-11-2018T03:17:45,Vatruvius,?*
29-11-2018T03:19:14,Bgrmystr2,no? This is standard fare. :thinking:
29-11-2018T03:19:41,Vatruvius,Then please clarify because all the wires in my brain are crossed every which way.
29-11-2018T03:19:50,Vatruvius,Some in ways I do not think are possible.
29-11-2018T03:20:16,Vatruvius,"""Can I get a bomb specialist in here!"""
29-11-2018T03:22:27,Bgrmystr2,"lol even if I gave you examples of bamboozlement, would you even remember?"
29-11-2018T03:23:04,Vatruvius,"Like I said, a lot of crossed wires, it is a fifty/fifty if the wire actually goes back to where it is suppose to, you just can't tell."
29-11-2018T03:23:31,Bgrmystr2,"like an antagonist that actually wants peace and is non-violent, has a lot of great ideas but is surrounded by those willing to do what they are not as a means to the end."
29-11-2018T03:24:24,Bgrmystr2,"vs a protagonist that will, objectively, go in guns blazing shoot first ask questions later, just to find out they're fighting with someone who has nothing to do with anything."
29-11-2018T03:24:39,Vatruvius,"Clarification, the antagonist is the violent past one, the protagonist is the non-violent one."
29-11-2018T03:24:41,Vatruvius,?
29-11-2018T03:24:59,Bgrmystr2,"no, I'm giving you a good bamboozle."
29-11-2018T03:25:06,Vatruvius,Ah...
29-11-2018T03:25:11,Vatruvius,Hmm...
29-11-2018T03:27:15,Vatruvius,"That is a pretty good bamboozle, I have to say. But, from an outside perspective, isn't the protagonist the villain, or rather, the gun-ho hero with far too many...damn...what is that word..."
29-11-2018T03:27:20,Vatruvius,"See, I hit a crossed wire."
29-11-2018T03:27:22,Vatruvius,Fuck!
29-11-2018T03:28:12,Vatruvius,"Collateral, this the word. Far too much collateral damage?"
29-11-2018T03:28:20,Vatruvius,that's*
29-11-2018T03:30:46,Vatruvius,"But in all honesty, what I said early is the situation I find myself in with my comic right now. I just see no real way to go about solving that kind of situation. I mean, I know I said I did early but when I laid it out, it was like two/three things and"
29-11-2018T03:30:50,Vatruvius,that's it!
29-11-2018T03:31:00,Vatruvius,"Overall, not pleased."
29-11-2018T03:31:51,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, maybe not. The protag might not really be the best of guys, like uh.. that blonde dude from My Hero Academia. Rash, selfish, ignorant, severe inferiority complex, etc"
29-11-2018T03:32:31,Bgrmystr2,"but the guy's still a ""hero"" and still trying to stop the bad guys cuz, yknow, they're not nice."
29-11-2018T03:33:13,Vatruvius,"Hmm...I get that the hero does not have to be perfect. Heck, they could just be the lesser of two evils who is fighting the greater evil and thus is the hero."
29-11-2018T03:33:36,Vatruvius,"It's just, that is not the case."
29-11-2018T03:33:48,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, this trope is one of the best I've seen, and so rarely used https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist"
29-11-2018T03:34:33,Bgrmystr2,or even the villain protagonist
29-11-2018T03:34:48,Bgrmystr2,it's so rare to see that kinda thing put to good use
29-11-2018T03:35:53,Vatruvius,Interesting.
29-11-2018T03:36:43,Vatruvius,"Still, that is an interesting roll but what the hell is my protagonist, or whatever roll they turn into, going to do? How will she act? That is my problem."
29-11-2018T03:36:55,Bgrmystr2,dunno. :o
29-11-2018T03:37:15,Bgrmystr2,"gotta figure it out, that's the whole thing bout writing stories"
29-11-2018T03:37:42,Vatruvius,"Yeah, well..."
29-11-2018T03:38:53,Vatruvius,"See, Christmas break is coming up."
29-11-2018T03:39:02,Vatruvius,I am going to have nothing but time on my hands.
29-11-2018T03:39:17,Vatruvius,Time to just literally go insane trying to solve this problem in my head.
29-11-2018T03:39:40,Vatruvius,"And if I have to scrap everything, then what am I going to change to avoid this problem again?"
29-11-2018T03:39:52,Vatruvius,"I feel like, JESUS CHRIST!"
29-11-2018T03:39:59,Vatruvius,WHY!?!
29-11-2018T03:40:16,Vatruvius,"Sorry, something different."
29-11-2018T03:41:01,Vatruvius,"I looked up and since I am wearing blue light glasses though my ceiling fan, which was out of focus, was a spider on top of my glasses."
29-11-2018T03:41:44,Vatruvius,I uh...I have nothing to say now. I am just going to be lost in thought all night.
29-11-2018T03:42:06,Vatruvius,Be sure to check that I am still sane when I turn up for streams will you Bgr?
29-11-2018T03:42:42,Bgrmystr2,"for sake of shenanigans, what you can try to do is write a 'what if' of your story where your protag and antag's roles are reversed.. and then think about how you would tell the perspective of each one"
29-11-2018T03:43:25,Bgrmystr2,"and see if you can pull some reverse-reversals, I guess."
29-11-2018T03:43:47,Bgrmystr2,it's sometimes nice to just.. look at the other side of the mirror
29-11-2018T03:44:00,Bgrmystr2,"and see if things change, or if they stay the same"
29-11-2018T03:44:09,Bgrmystr2,and you'll never be sane as long as you're here
29-11-2018T03:44:20,Bgrmystr2,though the fact that you've come here proves you'll likely never be sane again.
29-11-2018T03:44:23,Bgrmystr2,it's too late
29-11-2018T03:44:28,Bgrmystr2,you're doomed.
29-11-2018T03:46:52,Dadrobit,"If you're actually interested in learning about writing compelling heros, read this book. https://www.amazon.com/Hero-Thousand-Faces-Joseph-Campbell/dp/0691017840/ref=asc_df_0691017840/?tag=bingshoppinga-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid={creative}&hvpos={adposition"

29-11-2018T04:13:44,Vatruvius,"Behold, I have returned!"
29-11-2018T04:18:22,Vatruvius,"Thanks Dadro, maybe I will try out audible with it."
29-11-2018T04:19:54,Vatruvius,"If I cannot come up with some sort of alternative for my comic, I will have to resort to starting by scratch. Hopefully, I can come up with something in two weeks because I really do like this world and the characters I have created."
29-11-2018T04:20:13,Bgrmystr2,why do you need to start from scratch?
29-11-2018T04:21:11,Vatruvius,"I hope I do not have to, we'll see. I will explain why if it turns out I have to."
29-11-2018T05:32:53,Vatruvius,Now I am getting off for sure. Bye!

29-11-2018T18:30:54,Vatruvius,And my college applications are away! :ctwokinds-sleepoverB:
29-11-2018T18:33:32,CrRAR,Nothing else to do now except hope and pray~ :pray:
29-11-2018T18:33:50,Vatruvius,"Yes, but I am rather happy I no longer have to do anything."
29-11-2018T18:34:38,CrRAR,"That's super, it's good to have all that done, it is a surprisingly hectic process."
29-11-2018T18:35:18,CrRAR,Has the Common App made things any easier these days?
29-11-2018T18:35:47,CrRAR,I remeber that was becoming increasingly accepted by more schools around the time I had to do all that.
29-11-2018T18:36:10,Vatruvius,"I totally forgot about that, but I was only applying to UCs and CSUs so just one application on each site."
29-11-2018T18:37:22,Vatruvius,"I remember using the Common App when I applied two years ago, I also remember how chaotic it made it feel because after the general stuff was done, each school wanted something unique so on top of the general application you had essay galore."
29-11-2018T18:37:38,Vatruvius,"I felt it was rather simple this time around, no bullshit."
29-11-2018T18:37:52,Vatruvius,"Of course, no Common App and no private schools."
29-11-2018T18:38:16,CrRAR,"Yeah very true, It might be better to use their specific one overall, at least that's how I kinda always felt. I always thought it was a more deliberate tell that you wanted that school in particular to take the time to fill out the school-specific one."
29-11-2018T18:39:46,Vatruvius,"I suppose, I just hope this time around my application stands out now that I am transferring rather than applying."
29-11-2018T18:40:47,Vatruvius,"I attended an early college high school so my GPA was not the best but it was good. However, at the time schools didn't even bother to look at students below a 3.8 GPA even though the majority of high schools are notoriously easy."
29-11-2018T18:41:23,Vatruvius,"That is not right, schools didn't bother to look at white students below a 3.8 GPA."
29-11-2018T18:41:26,Vatruvius,"There, that is more accurate."
29-11-2018T18:44:14,Bgrmystr2,"you want colleges that look at students below 3.8 GPA, come to Louisiana"
29-11-2018T18:44:24,Bgrmystr2,though I guarantee you you won't learn shit from the college
29-11-2018T18:44:28,Bgrmystr2,so there's that.
29-11-2018T18:45:21,Vatruvius,"Yeah, it is just frustrating to be barred from most schools in California when the high school I graduated from that year placed second in the state."
29-11-2018T18:45:38,Vatruvius,The following year it placed first.
29-11-2018T19:51:29,CrRAR,"Not to worry, these days an education is an education. Any school is a good enough vessel. Your own undying persistence is fuel enough for success."

29-11-2018T21:04:37,Twokinds,I want to make it look like Flora is lying on the desktop background
29-11-2018T21:04:52,SageSaga,Tom - i need you to draw my background today
29-11-2018T21:04:58,Twokinds,Okay

29-11-2018T21:06:32,Mihari,"I think most people can agree it's sexy, unless they are completely anti furry, but if they are they are in the wrong stream."

29-11-2018T22:15:59,unsteddyphoenix,like 5 or 6 at least
29-11-2018T22:16:01,unsteddyphoenix,Oh
29-11-2018T22:16:10,CrRAR,good estimate
29-11-2018T22:16:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"only 8, thought it was gonna be more"
29-11-2018T22:16:18,BadFoMo,"Sorry, I have an urge to Troll. Replace the Candy Cane with a Gingerbread Man and make Maeve look like she's going to catch it with her mouth."

29-11-2018T22:16:47,IronHorseComics,lol
29-11-2018T22:16:47,Twokinds,I used to use tons of layers but over the years I've learned to consolidate them and be more efficient.
29-11-2018T22:17:26,Zakuru,OH THIS
29-11-2018T22:17:27,ShadowSoap,Hurray Efficiency!
29-11-2018T22:17:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Make sense, gotta work on that my self"
29-11-2018T22:17:41,Zakuru,"Tom, what was the most amount of layers you've ever used in a single piece?"
29-11-2018T22:18:02,thestooge,Oh wow!
29-11-2018T22:18:17,IronHorseComics,*dramatic zoom* One Meelion layers
29-11-2018T22:18:35,Zakuru,i think the most i did was either 48 or 53?

29-11-2018T22:19:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'm at 59 right now Zak
29-11-2018T22:19:17,Zakuru,years old?
29-11-2018T22:19:22,Twokinds,I think that used something like 120 layers.
29-11-2018T22:19:27,Zakuru,SWEET
29-11-2018T22:19:28,ShadowSoap,o.o

29-11-2018T22:19:47,w0lfmare,That would brick my PC
29-11-2018T22:19:58,Zakuru,^
29-11-2018T22:20:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,That would brick me personally
29-11-2018T22:20:23,IronHorseComics,how was your computer able to handle it?

29-11-2018T22:21:27,qwe304,yo that would use like 8 gb of ram
29-11-2018T22:21:33,qwe304,just for the layers

29-11-2018T22:23:10,IronHorseComics,that's the biggest load of baloney I've ever read
29-11-2018T22:23:17,Bgrmystr2,whoever would say that has never even seen an art program in their damn life xD
29-11-2018T22:23:34,AFallingTree,"i use 3d software so does that count as an ""art program"""
29-11-2018T22:23:40,Bgrmystr2,yeah
29-11-2018T22:23:42,IronHorseComics,oh lord
29-11-2018T22:23:50,Bgrmystr2,3d rendering software definitely count
29-11-2018T22:23:54,Bgrmystr2,and those are monsters
29-11-2018T22:23:57,IronHorseComics,that would be even more intensive
29-11-2018T22:24:15,AFallingTree,it takes me 6 hrs to render things
29-11-2018T22:24:26,twentydollarcoffee,:0
29-11-2018T22:24:37,Bgrmystr2,need a better machine probably :C
29-11-2018T22:24:40,IronHorseComics,"people think games are resource intensive, they should see an art program go at full force"
29-11-2018T22:24:42,AFallingTree,i use my PC as a heater in the winter XD
29-11-2018T22:25:02,IronHorseComics,"that's actually going to kill your computer, tree"
29-11-2018T22:25:06,CrRAR,yes just snuggle up next to it
29-11-2018T22:25:10,CrRAR,with such dramatic lighting on this tree you'd suspect it's 2kinds' newest villain.
29-11-2018T22:25:20,qwe304,@IronHorseComics one time I had a 3-d for my engineering class that took 5 hours
29-11-2018T22:25:21,AFallingTree,na its designed for that stuff
29-11-2018T22:25:22,CrRAR,dunnn dunnnnn dunnnnnn
29-11-2018T22:25:25,qwe304,for a single frame
29-11-2018T22:25:29,Bgrmystr2,"depending, IronHorse"
29-11-2018T22:25:31,IronHorseComics,"as a guy who had a laptop motherboard burn out, I speak from personal experience"
29-11-2018T22:25:40,Bgrmystr2,cuz my pc keeps my room bout 10 degrees hotter than the rest of the house
29-11-2018T22:25:42,Bgrmystr2,for normal use
29-11-2018T22:25:49,Ordithus,wow
29-11-2018T22:26:11,CrRAR,mine used to
29-11-2018T22:26:17,AFallingTree,yeah same here
29-11-2018T22:26:20,SageSaga,IronHorse- your experience is anecdotal evidence
29-11-2018T22:26:24,CrRAR,I upgraded it since
29-11-2018T22:26:33,qwe304,@IronHorseComics trying to do drawing or gaming on a laptop; thats where your problem is
29-11-2018T22:26:38,CrRAR,Pentium D's were no joke
29-11-2018T22:26:58,unsteddyphoenix,"If you just keep an eye on  your internal temperatures, you should be fine"
29-11-2018T22:27:21,twentydollarcoffee,I just did a full motherboard swap on my laptop; it turns out the problem was actually the LCD cable lmfao
29-11-2018T22:27:22,IronHorseComics,I've got a proper desktop since then (it probably needs to dedicated graphics card but it works fine for now)
29-11-2018T22:27:52,CrRAR,"good lord twenty, that's torture. xD"
29-11-2018T22:27:54,Twokinds,brb
29-11-2018T22:27:55,Mihari,"Number one cause for Laptop failure, obstructed airflow!"
29-11-2018T22:27:57,AFallingTree,rendering on a laptop IS possible as long as you limit the RAM and GPU usage
29-11-2018T22:27:59,CrRAR,okay~
29-11-2018T22:28:00,qwe304,"@IronHorseComics if you want a gpu, get a used rx 480, they are like $100 on ebay"
29-11-2018T22:28:35,CrRAR,gfx cards are plentiful now bitcoin mining went bust lol
29-11-2018T22:28:43,AFallingTree,ikr
29-11-2018T22:28:44,SageSaga,the rx 480 isnt terrible but it still falls behind the GTX1060
29-11-2018T22:28:48,IronHorseComics,I was thinking of getting a nvidia as I play games on this PC as well
29-11-2018T22:28:55,qwe304,you cant get a 1060 for $100 tho
29-11-2018T22:29:20,SageSaga,yeah but its worth spending the extra money if you want something better than 60fps at 1080
29-11-2018T22:29:41,qwe304,well ofc you can always spend more for more performance
29-11-2018T22:29:52,CrRAR,"tru, resolution of monitors is a factor, 4K became more popular"
29-11-2018T22:29:54,ZRO4825,My 970 still holds up pretty well currently.
29-11-2018T22:30:04,qwe304,the rx480 merely is a distinctly high value at its current price
29-11-2018T22:30:22,SageSaga,970s can still keep up a bit at 1080 just fine
29-11-2018T22:30:27,ZRO4825,"But then again, I don't go above 1080p either, seeing as my monitor nor my second monitor (aka TV) go above that anyway. :3"
29-11-2018T22:30:47,qwe304,I do 3x1080p
29-11-2018T22:30:48,Mihari,1070 Ti is a good buy if you can find it.
29-11-2018T22:30:53,Mihari,Will last you a long time too.
29-11-2018T22:30:58,CrRAR,mmm
29-11-2018T22:31:22,AFallingTree,i use a 1070
29-11-2018T22:31:38,Mihari,"1080 Ti is even better, but ya, good luck finding that. XD"
29-11-2018T22:31:46,AFallingTree,well in an external enclosure
29-11-2018T22:31:47,SageSaga,and at a decent price
29-11-2018T22:31:56,qwe304,the new 20XX cards are a horrible value
29-11-2018T22:31:56,Ordithus,I need to upgrade my electrical to use my desktop :ctwokinds-keith8D:
29-11-2018T22:32:12,SageSaga,not if you value THE BEST very highly XD
29-11-2018T22:32:15,ZRO4825,"But hey, you can get a 2080 for less than a 1080ti atm. lol"
29-11-2018T22:32:24,SageSaga,the 2080 is trash though so far
29-11-2018T22:32:33,SageSaga,2070 isnt bad- needs a price drop though
29-11-2018T22:32:40,qwe304,@SageSaga 970 is $120
29-11-2018T22:32:50,SageSaga,yeah i know Qwe
29-11-2018T22:32:57,Corinthian,"Yeah, I heard the 2080 had some problems or something."
29-11-2018T22:32:58,ZRO4825,Sounds about right for the performance level I get. :)
29-11-2018T22:33:00,AFallingTree,id say just hold out on getting a new GPU for the time being
29-11-2018T22:33:14,Mihari,970 will get you 30 FPS on almost everything @ 1080P with medium to high settings.
29-11-2018T22:33:29,ZRO4825,I do better than 30 on 90% of my games o_O
29-11-2018T22:33:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I have a 970 and I get 60 on most things
29-11-2018T22:33:51,SageSaga,did ya try MHW again?
29-11-2018T22:33:52,Mihari,I'm making a blanket statement XD
29-11-2018T22:33:56,Mihari,Anything better than 30 is great. XD
29-11-2018T22:34:00,qwe304,"also, rx 480 has 2x the vram"
29-11-2018T22:34:05,ZRO4825,"MHW ran great, when the CPU wasn't spiked to hell."
29-11-2018T22:34:20,SageSaga,i told you they fixed that

29-11-2018T22:34:37,ZRO4825,"Oh, yeah, that update did cut down the CPU usage a little. Dropped to around 85% constant now instead of 90%. The 100% spikes were still absolutely terrible though, lol."
