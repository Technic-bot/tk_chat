09-07-2018T18:04:15,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering: So.
09-07-2018T18:11:23,BadFoMo,So?
09-07-2018T18:13:10,Combak,Looks like there's no stream tonight.
09-07-2018T18:13:31,Combak,Or is there?
09-07-2018T18:14:02,Bgrmystr2,"well, streams on friday don't start till 9pm... you know this"
09-07-2018T18:14:04,Bgrmystr2,so I mean.. there's still a couple hours till then.
09-07-2018T18:14:18,Bgrmystr2,but we dunno
09-07-2018T18:14:24,Bgrmystr2,"if it happens, it happens :u"
09-07-2018T18:14:47,BadFoMo,Uh... It's Friday?
09-07-2018T18:14:58,Bgrmystr2,"the day is irrelevant, fomo, it's the time that matters"
09-07-2018T18:15:09,BadFoMo,Oh...
09-07-2018T18:15:35,Bgrmystr2,it's still too early to dismiss a stream
09-07-2018T18:15:48,Bgrmystr2,even if we don't know if there will be one.
09-07-2018T19:36:30,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
09-07-2018T20:00:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I give it till thirty. Tom may be doing a sleep
09-07-2018T20:21:29,rafaelrc,Mrow?
09-07-2018T20:26:47,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
09-07-2018T20:29:43,Combak,"Well, Tom isn't even in chat, so I'm doubting a stream tonight."
09-07-2018T20:30:06,Combak,"Hey Tom, if you read this, mind telling us if you're planning on doing all picks this week or not?"
09-07-2018T20:32:32,Combak,Ideally in the description of the next sketch.
09-07-2018T20:43:44,SpazztasticKiwi,He‚Äôll get us news when he figures it out himself
09-07-2018T20:43:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe he‚Äôll do a tweet üê¶
09-07-2018T20:54:34,unsteddyphoenix,I mean if he uploaded the first one he's probably just gonna do them all offstream
09-07-2018T20:54:41,unsteddyphoenix,Or has already done them even
09-07-2018T20:56:44,Bgrmystr2,^ prettymuch
09-07-2018T20:56:59,Bgrmystr2,"knowing tom, he's probably already done them all"
09-07-2018T20:57:01,TorqueEmUp,"Most likely, and I am 100% ok with that."
09-07-2018T21:57:49,Ordithus,It's the only chance I've got :ctwokinds-LauraCry:
09-07-2018T22:19:02,Nekonny,o/
09-07-2018T22:19:27,Dadrobit,o/ MAn
09-07-2018T22:19:30,Dadrobit,Man*
09-07-2018T22:21:21,Nekonny,heya
09-07-2018T22:22:55,Ordithus,yo
09-07-2018T22:28:22,Nekonny,con went well
09-07-2018T22:29:18,Ordithus,"Nice, you had fun?  Was this your first time at this con?"
09-07-2018T22:33:26,Dadrobit,Good to hear! Make a bunch of money?
09-07-2018T22:46:29,Nekonny,not sure
09-07-2018T22:48:21,Nekonny,so many expenses XD
09-07-2018T22:48:26,Nekonny,but it was fun!
09-07-2018T22:50:52,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-sleepoverA: Great!
09-07-2018T22:51:46,Dadrobit,"I imagine the room costs were a goodly part of that, but did you have to fly in as well?"
09-07-2018T23:11:07,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, I think the Westin hotel rooms were like $250 per night at the cheapest."
09-07-2018T23:11:24,TorqueEmUp,iirc
09-07-2018T23:11:54,TorqueEmUp,I cheaped out and stayed 20min away at a hotel for $65 a night
09-07-2018T23:12:32,TorqueEmUp,Westin probably makes some serious bank off of Anthrocon
09-07-2018T23:13:00,TorqueEmUp,Probably their most profitable weekend of the entire year.
09-07-2018T23:14:10,TorqueEmUp,"And seeing those rooms, for the money, they are no better than the cheapo hotel I stayed in."
