06-02-2018T17:59:12,NightMeaty22,Did you hear about the guy who got hit in the head with a can of soda? He was lucky it was a soft drink.
06-02-2018T17:59:26,wolfspartan1,booo
06-02-2018T17:59:29,TheBeckoner,That one is almost not a pun.
06-02-2018T17:59:52,Bgrmystr2,it was a pun
06-02-2018T17:59:56,JaydenMozingo,almost being the key word
06-02-2018T18:00:01,Bgrmystr2,not even almost
06-02-2018T18:00:06,Bgrmystr2,it was most definitely a pun.
06-02-2018T18:00:27,Bgrmystr2,"simple, but nonetheless."
06-02-2018T18:00:31,JaydenMozingo,dang skallywag
06-02-2018T18:00:38,TheBeckoner,Not necessarily. It could have been thrown in some weird soft bottle.
06-02-2018T18:00:48,TheBeckoner,nvm
06-02-2018T18:00:51,TheBeckoner,I re read it
06-02-2018T18:00:55,Bgrmystr2,Beck rly
06-02-2018T18:00:59,TheBeckoner,lol
06-02-2018T18:01:05,TheBeckoner,I totally missed can
06-02-2018T18:01:14,TheBeckoner,Could have been a soft can...
06-02-2018T18:01:44,NightMeaty22,: What do you get when you toss a hand grenade into a kitchen in France?
06-02-2018T18:01:47,Bgrmystr2,"yes, cans are usually called soft drinks. Thanks for explaining the joke. :ptv-unimpressed:"
06-02-2018T18:02:18,MidnightBlue78,Beegee is not amused :ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
06-02-2018T18:02:22,NightMeaty22,Linoleum blownapart.
06-02-2018T18:02:59,Bgrmystr2,"You don't explain the joke, midnight, it's not funny when you do that. :P"
06-02-2018T18:03:10,NightMeaty22,I'd tell you a chemistry joke but I know I wouldn't get a reaction.
06-02-2018T18:03:40,TheBeckoner,tbh it wasn't funny before sooo
06-02-2018T18:03:45,JaydenMozingo,has suffocated from to many dead puns
06-02-2018T18:03:53,Bgrmystr2,har har. You got anything actually good? :o
06-02-2018T18:04:07,NightMeaty22,No
06-02-2018T18:04:19,TheBeckoner,An honest man.
06-02-2018T18:04:55,NightMeaty22,"The first computer dates back to Adam and Eve. It was an Apple with limited memory, just one byte. And then everything crashed."
06-02-2018T18:05:16,JaydenMozingo,ded
06-02-2018T18:05:45,NightMeaty22,"About a month before he died, my uncle had his back covered in lard. After that, he went down hill fast."
06-02-2018T18:06:54,Char89TheCharizard,Is there a stream happening tonight?
06-02-2018T18:07:28,wolfspartan1,at 9pm

06-02-2018T18:07:41,JaydenMozingo,Ye
06-02-2018T18:07:49,Char89TheCharizard,I'm asking because last time there wasn't one
06-02-2018T18:08:25,Char89TheCharizard,that end up having Tom skip a week for the comic
06-02-2018T18:08:43,TheBeckoner,He skipped to do more work.
06-02-2018T18:09:08,Char89TheCharizard,on the comic or on commissions and stuff
06-02-2018T18:09:24,JaydenMozingo,Comic
06-02-2018T18:09:31,TheBeckoner,"Don't remember, I think in general."
06-02-2018T18:09:54,Char89TheCharizard,"He started last Friday, but for some reason switched to Patreon art mode"
06-02-2018T18:13:39,Bgrmystr2,"Tom doesn't do commissions, he was doing images for the Patreon color votes."
06-02-2018T18:14:01,Bgrmystr2,"he only does commissions when he goes to conventions, and that's in-person."
06-02-2018T18:15:36,JaydenMozingo,Welp. Imma do my homework until the stream starts
06-02-2018T18:15:53,JaydenMozingo,I leaving chat open on screen though

06-02-2018T18:18:31,RedDeath2018,Probably gonna miss part of the stream cause I’m going to church
06-02-2018T18:18:32,Bgrmystr2,dunno how many times I've done that :thinking:
06-02-2018T18:18:35,JaydenMozingo,has confirmed the sighting of NightMeaty22 sitting in a box
06-02-2018T18:18:47,RedDeath2018,See yo guys later

06-02-2018T18:19:32,wolfspartan1,the mission i hate the most is regret
06-02-2018T18:20:04,Bgrmystr2,lots of hard missions
06-02-2018T18:20:24,wolfspartan1,gravemind is another
06-02-2018T18:20:42,Bgrmystr2,it's been so long since I played..
06-02-2018T18:21:02,Bgrmystr2,"I usually go for anniversary, myself"
06-02-2018T18:21:07,NightMeaty22,I found a joke but i dont think i can show it
06-02-2018T18:21:31,wolfspartan1,anniversary is pretty i wish they would port it to pc
06-02-2018T18:21:34,Bgrmystr2,cuz both of my original disks tend to have issue reading
06-02-2018T18:21:54,wolfspartan1,i have halo 2 for og xbox pc and xbox one
06-02-2018T18:21:56,Bgrmystr2,"meh, they did a lot of nice work with the glows and stuff but the detail wasn't there."
06-02-2018T18:22:35,Bgrmystr2,"They tried too hard to make Anniversary good from cutscenes and fast motion, but when you're actually on the field and looking at it, there's a lot to be desired."
06-02-2018T18:22:56,Bgrmystr2,"there's a lot of really nice effects, but it wasn't fully-fleshed out"
06-02-2018T18:23:05,wolfspartan1,they could have made the whole mcc better tbh
06-02-2018T18:23:18,NightMeaty22,"A man went into a library and asked for a book on how to commit suicide. The librarian said: “F... off, you won’t bring it back.”"
06-02-2018T18:23:24,Bgrmystr2,and some changes in the campaign balance made me dislike some of those decisions
06-02-2018T18:24:32,wolfspartan1,i like the old main menu oh halo 2
06-02-2018T18:24:43,JaydenMozingo,I have the song Rocket Man by Elton John stuck in my head
06-02-2018T18:24:48,Bgrmystr2,"I don't have the MCC, so I dunno"
06-02-2018T18:24:57,Bgrmystr2,"I already own all the games I want, basically"
06-02-2018T18:25:09,Bgrmystr2,and know people who have the newer ones
06-02-2018T18:25:16,JaydenMozingo,Brb. Gotta go for dinner
06-02-2018T18:25:16,wolfspartan1,i got it for halo 2 online
06-02-2018T18:25:28,wolfspartan1,cya jay
06-02-2018T18:25:41,Bgrmystr2,I never liked online. Just the design of the service was rip-offfery
06-02-2018T18:25:51,Bgrmystr2,"enjoy, Jay"
06-02-2018T18:26:01,wolfspartan1,the pay wall of xbox live yea
06-02-2018T18:26:20,wolfspartan1,sad to see sony do the same with the ps4
06-02-2018T18:26:33,TheBeckoner,sighs in relief
06-02-2018T18:26:46,TheBeckoner,I just finished all of my trig homework.
06-02-2018T18:27:23,Bgrmystr2,"They don't get to double-dip me for money. That's not how it works. I already pay for the net, they're not going to make me pay for the ""privilege"" to use something I already paid for."
06-02-2018T18:27:47,Bgrmystr2,So I don't play on xbox live or use the PSN
06-02-2018T18:27:53,Bgrmystr2,out of principle
06-02-2018T18:28:06,Bgrmystr2,"kind of sad, really"
06-02-2018T18:28:16,wolfspartan1,it one reason i moved to pc
06-02-2018T18:28:42,wolfspartan1,i still got my xbox for the halos they didn't port to pc
06-02-2018T18:28:52,Bgrmystr2,"I never really needed to move, myself."
06-02-2018T18:30:09,wolfspartan1,i wish i did sooner i love my pc
06-02-2018T19:02:48,qwe304,have there been any (reasonably recent) sketches that contain a thumbs up? i need one for an edit...
06-02-2018T19:04:06,Bgrmystr2,the kiss one w/ Natani&Keith had Zen in the background with a thumbs up
06-02-2018T19:05:59,qwe304,"grr, its a bit too small and undeveloped for my purposes"
06-02-2018T19:06:51,Bgrmystr2,how do you figure?
06-02-2018T19:07:05,Bgrmystr2,the img is like 1600x1500
06-02-2018T19:07:12,Bgrmystr2,you can use the waifu 2x on it as well
06-02-2018T19:07:26,Bgrmystr2,"not only that, but it's in color as well"
06-02-2018T19:07:55,Bgrmystr2,not sure what exactly is underdeveloped about it
06-02-2018T19:07:59,qwe304,"size itself isnt an issue, its just that its a very rudementary thumbs up"
06-02-2018T19:08:32,qwe304,:ok_hand: would work too
06-02-2018T19:08:38,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: is there supposed to be something special about a thumbs up? It's just a thumbs up
06-02-2018T19:08:55,BluePhantom90,Well wonder what we will see this comic page... If tom will be on to stream it
06-02-2018T19:09:30,qwe304,"its just that that one, tom barely put any detail in it, even if i made it larger, you wouldnt have fingers on it"
06-02-2018T19:26:01,JaydenMozingo,has returned from his evening dinner

06-02-2018T19:51:53,JaydenMozingo,dude it's an amazing movie
06-02-2018T19:52:37,JaydenMozingo,"I mean, I don't know how you can drive a Dodge Ram 2500 with a flat back tire for 2 mile going 80"
06-02-2018T19:52:42,JaydenMozingo,but heeeeey

06-02-2018T19:57:39,Char89TheCharizard,thought I come back an hour early
06-02-2018T20:00:03,Bespin,any1 else excited for Solo
06-02-2018T20:00:07,Bespin,The new star wars story
06-02-2018T20:01:04,Char89TheCharizard,I guess. but it won't be the same with Harrison Ford not playing Solo
06-02-2018T20:01:14,Bespin,Eh
06-02-2018T20:03:51,wolfspartan1,ford hated playing solo
06-02-2018T20:04:48,Char89TheCharizard,contrariwise he was the best Solo
06-02-2018T20:05:14,wolfspartan1,he was
06-02-2018T20:07:20,Bespin,well so far he has been the only solo
06-02-2018T20:08:32,CrRAR,"haha, Ford hates all his roles, he views acting as just a job. Which is pretty badass, the cool arrogance Han has was probably genuine."
06-02-2018T20:08:39,Char89TheCharizard,the only reason he's not playing Solo in the new movie is because he's OLD
06-02-2018T20:09:18,CrRAR,mmmm
06-02-2018T20:22:50,Combak,"So, @Twokinds, whats the odds on a stream tonight?"

06-02-2018T20:40:21,Bgrmystr2,"Jay, have you ever seen police chases? Cuz they flatten tires all the time and they still keep going in all sorts of vehicles."
06-02-2018T20:40:57,Bgrmystr2,80mph? 2 miles? multiple flat tires. Some people still do it.
06-02-2018T20:41:06,Bgrmystr2,"hard to believe, but it happens"
06-02-2018T20:41:44,JaydenMozingo,through a corn field going over large bumps too?

06-02-2018T21:11:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"maybe because Tom is taking time to build the comic up, so he won't have to play catch up every week"

06-02-2018T22:32:14,Infinitedge,I believe if you combine a Herb and Honey it makes the health pots

06-02-2018T22:33:30,KawaiiFlora,"Sage Root, Cooking pot, Distilled Water"
06-02-2018T22:33:34,Dadrobit,Herb makes a basic heath pot. Health pot with Honey makes a super health pot.

06-02-2018T22:36:17,CrimsonHelsing,"so from what I'm seeing, I'd be assuming that the bigger, more experienced dragons are usually above dragons like Reni, despite her title"
06-02-2018T22:36:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,just noticed Reni's expression in the nora panel.... so cute

06-02-2018T22:37:11,PalmettoPathfinder1,I think you're right Crimson.  That might be how it works in dragon society.

06-02-2018T22:50:04,MuonNeutrino,"and..... uhh....... hard to compare, really"

06-02-2018T22:50:30,DarthRexKing,Aw. D:
06-02-2018T22:50:32,MetalAppleSauce,I couldn't guess
06-02-2018T22:50:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,you should
06-02-2018T22:50:36,MuonNeutrino,"tom's dragons tend to be more outright magical than tolkien's, but tolkien's tend to be larger and scarier"
06-02-2018T22:50:46,TLDragon,"I think Smaug was -significantly- larger than Nora, though Nora's got more overt magic"
06-02-2018T22:51:01,Dadrobit,"Smaug only had the one weak spot, and it doesn't involve gender swapping, so Nora is cooked."
06-02-2018T22:51:02,TLDragon,so it's hard to say.
06-02-2018T22:51:12,unsteddyphoenix,"Nora is basically a demi-god, but that's unique for a dragon."
06-02-2018T22:51:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Smaug was benedict cumberbatch, so........ tough call really"
06-02-2018T22:51:25,DarthRexKing,XD
06-02-2018T22:51:25,unsteddyphoenix,So o normie dragon like Reni's got no chance
06-02-2018T22:51:27,MuonNeutrino,it's hard to compare particularly because tom's universe subscribes to *vastly* different ideas about 'magic' than tolkien's
06-02-2018T22:51:45,DarthRexKing,Fair enough there.
06-02-2018T22:51:51,MetalAppleSauce,"You say that, Marv, but if there was ever official voice acting for TK, benedict could very well be Nora"
06-02-2018T22:52:01,MuonNeutrino,"in tolkien's universe 'magic' is a much more.... subtle, yet fundamental, type of thing"

06-02-2018T22:53:13,MuonNeutrino,"@unsteddyphoenix depends what you mean by 'magic'. it's implied that various 'supernatural' style abilities in tolkien's universe, like dragon's breath, are more or less 'magic', but it's a more subtle sort of thing"

06-02-2018T22:57:59,MuonNeutrino,given that he saw the originals
06-02-2018T22:58:16,DarthRexKing,And the way you analyze tolkien's  universe. Very scientific. Muon is a scientist!
06-02-2018T22:58:17,MuonNeutrino,but the thematic parallels are certainly obvious

06-02-2018T22:59:45,TLDragon,"on the other hand, the king of the elves might have been old enough to also recognize something pretty scary"
06-02-2018T22:59:46,MuonNeutrino,"because that sounds about right for that, but that's most definitely not his age"
06-02-2018T23:00:24,MetalAppleSauce,apparently 171 was enough years for smaug to grow up sufficiently enough
06-02-2018T23:00:33,MuonNeutrino,"@TLDragon thranduil is old, but we dont know how old for sure"

06-02-2018T23:01:00,MuonNeutrino,"he wasn't the original king of mirkwood/greenwood tho, oropher died in the battles around the last alliance at the start of the 3rd age, ~3000ish years before the ring war"
06-02-2018T23:01:24,MuonNeutrino,"ofc being that he's an elf thranduil could still be much older than that, so we don't know if he could have seen teh silmarils or not"

06-02-2018T23:04:19,TLDragon,"that's a reasonable point, though I guess that the way old things keep coming back to haunt modern people that I felt like the story of the silmarils wasn't over"

06-02-2018T23:09:27,NightMeaty22,?¿?¿
06-02-2018T23:09:27,RedDeath2018,I’m trying to teach my little bro to draw. Not going very well if you ask me
06-02-2018T23:09:32,Bgrmystr2,now he says otherwise.
06-02-2018T23:09:42,Bgrmystr2,The world changes very quickly.
06-02-2018T23:09:50,unsteddyphoenix,Because 100% of the dragons in the comic are attracted to humans
06-02-2018T23:09:50,DarthRexKing,wait wait. A dragon politician.
06-02-2018T23:09:52,Ordithus,Nora looks amazing in that center panel
06-02-2018T23:09:55,unsteddyphoenix,Only female dragons dont fall for Toms lies
06-02-2018T23:09:58,MetalAppleSauce,"According to Nora, as of today, there are no male dragons"
06-02-2018T23:10:06,ZahnHolley,do you know koi fishes like sucking on a babies bottle?

06-02-2018T23:10:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,no
06-02-2018T23:10:48,w0lfmare,Teaching people to draw is like training a jedi
06-02-2018T23:10:50,ZahnHolley,XD
06-02-2018T23:10:51,FenceEqualizer,Well that explains soooo much

06-02-2018T23:11:36,RedDeath2018,"W0lfmare, have you tried teaching a person to draw who has no drawing experience at all"
06-02-2018T23:11:40,unsteddyphoenix,So you either learn to draw or get lightning powers?
06-02-2018T23:11:46,RedDeath2018,Lol
06-02-2018T23:11:48,MetalAppleSauce,The dark side is stealing other people's art and claiming it as your own
06-02-2018T23:11:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
06-02-2018T23:11:51,Infinitedge,wish I knew how to draw
06-02-2018T23:11:51,TheBeckoner,I want the lightning.
06-02-2018T23:11:56,NightMeaty22,You cant fail but you can quit
06-02-2018T23:12:01,DarthRexKing,"Wait, that reminds me. There is some film where a girl falls in love with a WERE DRAGON."
06-02-2018T23:12:07,FenceEqualizer,Dragons kidnaping princes
06-02-2018T23:12:09,TheBeckoner,a wot
06-02-2018T23:12:12,DarthRexKing,I have to look it up.

06-02-2018T23:12:50,RedDeath2018,Start by tracing then move up that’s what I did
06-02-2018T23:13:04,DarthRexKing,"And it's basically what beckoner just said. A dragon kidnaps a bride girl, I think she was a princess, and it turns out the dragon is a human who can turn into a dragon."
06-02-2018T23:13:08,RedDeath2018,Then you may draw like Tom
06-02-2018T23:13:15,NightMeaty22,I want to be accepted for who i am
06-02-2018T23:13:16,Char89TheCharizard,brb

06-02-2018T23:14:00,DarthRexKing,A boot to the ass.
06-02-2018T23:14:09,TheBeckoner,All the way in.
06-02-2018T23:14:12,RedDeath2018,And look at Tom’s drawings that’s what got me motivated
06-02-2018T23:14:14,DarthRexKing,XD

06-02-2018T23:14:54,KawaiiFlora,Tom has probably inspired a ton of people to draw
06-02-2018T23:14:57,RedDeath2018,I started reading his comics then I started to have more and more of an interest
06-02-2018T23:15:27,DarthRexKing,I like both markiplier and tom. Then I discovered the two were brothers. My life was complete.

06-02-2018T23:16:44,MetalAppleSauce,I strayed into the dark side of the internet for a few hours then found twokinds
06-02-2018T23:16:56,Twokinds,Who's that?

06-02-2018T23:18:03,MetalAppleSauce,Mark is the alternate reality Tom that likes showing his face on camera and plays videogames for a living
06-02-2018T23:18:07,KawaiiFlora,I was watching the comic as yt vids and then noticed a link in the description
06-02-2018T23:18:27,WarToWin,same
06-02-2018T23:18:29,MetalAppleSauce,"Kept the trait of loving squirrels, though"
06-02-2018T23:18:30,DarthRexKing,"Idea. Tom's comic becomes so famous, it not only has comics, but an animated series and video games, then Markiplier plays twokinds the video game."
06-02-2018T23:18:31,TheBeckoner,I like this music...
06-02-2018T23:18:34,RedDeath2018,Btw Tom I found your YouTube channel. It really helps when I miss a stream
06-02-2018T23:18:52,TheBeckoner,It isnt Toms
06-02-2018T23:18:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Don't think thats Tom's dude
06-02-2018T23:19:00,RedDeath2018,What??!!!
06-02-2018T23:19:00,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah thats not Toms
06-02-2018T23:19:02,MuonNeutrino,is that channel actually run by tom? didn;t think so
06-02-2018T23:19:02,TheBeckoner,It's iliars
06-02-2018T23:19:07,KawaiiFlora,ye there is a yt channel called twokinds streams or something
06-02-2018T23:19:08,RedDeath2018,Ohhhhhh
06-02-2018T23:19:09,MuonNeutrino,i thought that was just someone who recorded the streams
06-02-2018T23:19:10,KawaiiFlora,not his
06-02-2018T23:19:14,DarthRexKing,Tomas the tank engine.
06-02-2018T23:19:15,MetalAppleSauce,^

06-02-2018T23:19:34,KawaiiFlora,Tom records the streams on Picarto so i dont see the point in it
06-02-2018T23:19:37,w0lfmare,An impostor
06-02-2018T23:19:43,MetalAppleSauce,That just gave me the idea of Thomas the Tank engine in front of the drawing board
06-02-2018T23:19:49,DarthRexKing,&gt;w&gt;
06-02-2018T23:19:56,RedDeath2018,Sorry iliar that I exposed you
06-02-2018T23:19:58,MuonNeutrino,"@KawaiiFlora he didn't always do that, and youtube is a lot more convenient in some ways anyway"
06-02-2018T23:19:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Illiar is not longer a robit? D: what

06-02-2018T23:20:32,DarthRexKing,So a fake channel. Well I guess you can't say iliar without LIAR.
06-02-2018T23:20:36,unsteddyphoenix,Also picarto has limited storage so you cant watch hella old streams
06-02-2018T23:20:38,MetalAppleSauce,o shit

06-02-2018T23:55:38,Dadrobit,My favorite one are the people who want it straight up for free.
06-02-2018T23:55:40,MetalAppleSauce,"You would think ""No OC"" in big bold letters in the description of the patron options would strike someone's attention"
06-02-2018T23:55:47,MuonNeutrino,"use 7 until it literally doesn't work anymore, do not like people doing things to my computer without asking first"
06-02-2018T23:56:08,MetalAppleSauce,"Like, if he doesn't do it for money, why the fuck would you think he would do it for free"
06-02-2018T23:56:19,Endymion,Reminds me I need to install my computer one of these days. Been sitting in a box for going on two years now.

06-02-2018T23:56:46,Dadrobit,"Because people just come into random streams and ask for shit for free hoping to get lucky with an artist who's desperate for ""exposure""."
06-02-2018T23:56:56,HeresyArtStream,Is it any wonder that the stock exchanges crashed as soon as Microsoft released the new Windows update?
