22-06-2018T00:02:11,Tharkis,comicon local to me is the reason i made an 'oc' in the first place
22-06-2018T00:02:29,MallardDuckAvia,I’ve never been to comicon
22-06-2018T00:02:37,Tharkis,"because i used to commision DC and Marvel comic chars i liked, then i thought 'why not commission my own character?!"""
22-06-2018T00:02:48,MallardDuckAvia,None of my friends or family even knows I’m a furry
22-06-2018T00:02:57,SageSaga,when this is done i will be working on the AI comic

22-06-2018T01:06:26,SageSaga,what was that story- was it da vinci that was questioned about his skill as an artist and to prove it he drew a perfect circle free hand?
22-06-2018T01:08:13,ZRO4825,lol
22-06-2018T01:08:35,SageSaga,oh no it was Giotto di Bondone
22-06-2018T01:10:22,SageSaga,and the person questioning him was the Pope!
22-06-2018T01:11:13,unsteddyphoenix,Did he draw a face
22-06-2018T01:11:16,unsteddyphoenix,Then erase it
22-06-2018T01:11:22,unsteddyphoenix,And was left with a circle?
22-06-2018T01:12:58,SageSaga,"man its too bad i dont curse- because then i could be like ""What? you dont think im a good artist? Watch THIS"" *screw up drawing a perfect circle and then scream the F-word*"
22-06-2018T01:13:24,unsteddyphoenix,You dont curse? Huh.
22-06-2018T01:13:27,unsteddyphoenix,Even IRL?
22-06-2018T01:13:34,SageSaga,at all
22-06-2018T01:13:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,your a stronger man then me
22-06-2018T01:13:50,unsteddyphoenix,Just as a personal thing?
22-06-2018T01:13:57,BadFoMo,And me.
22-06-2018T01:14:05,SageSaga,something to lord over my parents
22-06-2018T01:14:55,Bgrmystr2,lol sage
22-06-2018T01:15:00,Bgrmystr2,"Me, I just don't care. :v"
22-06-2018T01:15:04,Bgrmystr2,they're just words
22-06-2018T01:15:07,SageSaga,"""I cant believe you drew a girl with boobs that big barely wearing anything!"" ""Well at least i dont curse!"" ""****!"""
22-06-2018T01:15:23,unsteddyphoenix,Smart
22-06-2018T01:15:39,Bgrmystr2,I don't see the big deal with either one
22-06-2018T01:15:48,Pdud,Lol
22-06-2018T01:15:48,unsteddyphoenix,I see big deals in Sages art often
22-06-2018T01:16:08,BadFoMo,Dang. I was thinking of making a joke like that.
22-06-2018T01:16:24,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, I don't think boobs are a big deal :v"
22-06-2018T01:16:34,SageSaga,also my parents used to tell me not to listen to shows and things with a lot of cursing- because it would wear off on me- so this is just proof they are wrong
22-06-2018T01:17:07,Pdud,I had the exsct opposite problem
22-06-2018T01:17:09,Bgrmystr2,lool
22-06-2018T01:17:12,SageSaga,but in all seriousness yeah i just think if im going to curse at someone or something its gonna be something really serious
22-06-2018T01:17:25,Bgrmystr2,my mother's the same way
22-06-2018T01:17:37,Pdud,Scream jar
22-06-2018T01:18:32,SageSaga,"my friend said he had a dream where I was driving him home and i looked at him and said ""**** ****"" and he was like ""OMG! NO ONE WILL EVER BELIEVE ME WHEN I TELL THEM WHAT YOU SAID!"""
22-06-2018T01:18:44,Bgrmystr2,hahahaha
22-06-2018T01:19:16,ZRO4825,I swear all the time. Quite vehemently even at moments! 😂
22-06-2018T01:19:27,unsteddyphoenix,"I feel like, at some point hearing you curse becomes a distinction of achievement"
22-06-2018T01:19:27,SageSaga,also - in case of a Zombie attack or something when i message them i am supposed to curse so they know it isnt a joke
22-06-2018T01:19:37,unsteddyphoenix,"""I made Sage curse, im a pretty big deal"""
22-06-2018T01:19:39,ZRO4825,XD

22-06-2018T01:20:06,Bgrmystr2,"prettymuch, phoenix"
22-06-2018T01:20:22,unsteddyphoenix,I wonder if there's a way without also simultaniously getting banned hmm...
22-06-2018T01:20:32,ZRO4825,lol
22-06-2018T01:20:51,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering: I'm gonna think not
22-06-2018T01:20:52,Bgrmystr2,but
22-06-2018T01:21:04,Bgrmystr2,"there is probably a way, though it's much more likely that it'll be too far"
22-06-2018T01:21:11,unsteddyphoenix,Need insane persuasion rolls
22-06-2018T01:22:02,SageSaga,to get me to curse you'll need to do something more horrendous than most can stomach
22-06-2018T01:22:16,unsteddyphoenix,I do have a pretty weak stomach...
22-06-2018T01:22:56,SageSaga,like- create the worlds first catgirl and murder her in a very inhumane fashion kinda horrendous
22-06-2018T01:23:12,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: Like.. I don't think I could even do that
22-06-2018T01:23:21,Bgrmystr2,catgirl doesn't deserve that
22-06-2018T01:23:44,SageSaga,let me put it this way- Trump hasnt made me curse yet and hes having children taken from their parents and put in cages
22-06-2018T01:23:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,revs chainsaw
22-06-2018T01:23:49,unsteddyphoenix,Did you swear at beetlejuice when he messed up Rem?

22-06-2018T01:25:08,SageSaga,"i saw a T-shirt with Rem on it wearing a t-shirt saying ""Twister Champion"""
22-06-2018T01:25:43,unsteddyphoenix,Thats a bad feel
22-06-2018T01:25:50,Bgrmystr2,I only enjoy saying it cuz it seems like it bugs ppl
22-06-2018T01:26:03,Bgrmystr2,That beetlejuice guy can die in a hole tho
22-06-2018T01:26:19,ZRO4825,He was a dick &gt;:(
22-06-2018T01:26:22,Bgrmystr2,agreed
22-06-2018T01:26:30,Bgrmystr2,I can still make jokes tho
22-06-2018T01:26:33,Bgrmystr2,cuz it's funny
22-06-2018T01:26:42,SageSaga,he's terrifying
22-06-2018T01:27:03,unsteddyphoenix,But he's also so memeable~

22-06-2018T01:29:37,unsteddyphoenix,Is that a giant robot one?
22-06-2018T01:29:49,Bgrmystr2,cuz the episodes weren't being released or somesuch

22-06-2018T01:34:53,unsteddyphoenix,I also skip them...
22-06-2018T01:34:54,SageSaga,considering the ending i cant imagine there being more than 2 XD
22-06-2018T01:34:57,unsteddyphoenix,*always
22-06-2018T01:35:22,Bgrmystr2,I listen to it the whole way the first time usually
22-06-2018T01:35:37,Bgrmystr2,"if I particularly like it, I'll listen to it a few times"
22-06-2018T01:35:44,Bgrmystr2,for the first few eps
22-06-2018T01:35:50,Bgrmystr2,but I usually skip it if I'm rewatching an anime
22-06-2018T01:36:48,SageSaga,i listen to the MHA openings every time
22-06-2018T01:37:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"peace sign is my fav, the new one is kinda meh tbh"

22-06-2018T01:37:51,Bgrmystr2,but no information yet on MAL
22-06-2018T01:37:54,SageSaga,the new one has good music with a great base- but it doesnt match the also awesome animation
22-06-2018T01:38:18,SageSaga,for Code Geass?
22-06-2018T01:38:23,Bgrmystr2,yeah
22-06-2018T01:38:34,SageSaga,how?
22-06-2018T01:38:37,unsteddyphoenix,The openings always have spoilers for the whole season in them~
22-06-2018T01:38:48,unsteddyphoenix,Characters that dont get introduced 'til like the 8th episode lol
22-06-2018T01:39:19,Bgrmystr2,"dunno, says the 10th anniversary event announced a new anime title for Code Geass"

22-06-2018T01:39:46,Bgrmystr2,Code Geass: Fukkatsu no Lelouch
22-06-2018T01:39:53,Bgrmystr2,says MAL
22-06-2018T01:39:58,SageSaga,it's by Clamp - same group that did Code Geass
22-06-2018T01:40:17,SageSaga,and Chobits and Card Captor Sakura and XXXHolic and Tsubasa Chronicles -
22-06-2018T01:40:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,adding it to the list
22-06-2018T01:40:26,unsteddyphoenix,according to google X is shojo?
22-06-2018T01:40:39,SageSaga,it has pretty boys
22-06-2018T01:40:44,SageSaga,but most anime does
22-06-2018T01:40:55,Bgrmystr2,Chobits was pretty damn good
22-06-2018T01:41:01,SageSaga,look at a Trailer for X
22-06-2018T01:41:03,ZRO4825,Chiiii~
22-06-2018T01:41:06,Bgrmystr2,I never got interested in their other stuff though
22-06-2018T01:41:30,SageSaga,i think it was X/1999
22-06-2018T01:41:40,Bgrmystr2,I have the entire Chobits manga series before they made the omnibus
22-06-2018T01:41:55,Bgrmystr2,"good writers, them."
22-06-2018T01:42:28,JamesBSquirrel3,"How far you go of couple sections of that comic page, Sage?"
22-06-2018T01:42:50,Bgrmystr2,xD I can't unsee the do look more like.

22-06-2018T01:47:28,Racerxiii,Wtf????
22-06-2018T01:47:40,ZRO4825,A question I ask every day for one reason or another.
22-06-2018T01:47:59,Racerxiii,:ptv-shock:
22-06-2018T01:48:41,SageSaga,?
22-06-2018T01:48:56,Bgrmystr2,prolly commenting on what James said
22-06-2018T01:49:24,Racerxiii,I am new here so can someone give me an explanation?????
22-06-2018T01:49:45,Pdud,You amd me both
22-06-2018T01:49:46,ZRO4825,"of what, exactly?"
22-06-2018T01:50:00,Racerxiii,This app
22-06-2018T01:50:14,Bgrmystr2,"to what, exactly? Sage is streaming drawing his comic page right now"
22-06-2018T01:50:26,Bgrmystr2,:o
22-06-2018T01:50:34,ZRO4825,"So, from that, I assume you found this via a phone. At which point, I would point out that Picarto.tv is a livestreaming service mostly intended for artists."
22-06-2018T01:50:56,Bgrmystr2,How do you find an app accidentally..?
22-06-2018T01:51:07,ZRO4825,"In the case of Sage here, he streams weekly working on Patreon content, commisions, and one of his two webcomics."
22-06-2018T01:51:14,Racerxiii,Social media????
22-06-2018T01:51:30,Racerxiii,:ptv-uneasy:
22-06-2018T01:51:34,Bgrmystr2,I don't think that's how it works xD
22-06-2018T01:51:51,ZRO4825,"I'm less concerned about the ""finding"" of an app accidentally and more the installing and usage of said app without reading anything as to what it is. :thinking:"
22-06-2018T01:52:02,Bgrmystr2,lolo
22-06-2018T01:52:23,ZRO4825,"I mean, just pointing out, but ""Let's click it and find out"" is how a lot of people end up with viruses on their PCs."
22-06-2018T01:53:01,Pdud,Yolo
22-06-2018T01:54:18,ZRO4825,That attitude's a good way to make sure if it's true or not~
22-06-2018T01:54:25,ZRO4825,"Also, not quite correct in reference to tech anyway!"
22-06-2018T01:54:39,SageSaga,i think people use Yolo the wrong way
22-06-2018T01:55:00,ZRO4825,"Well, to be fair, most people who use YOLO shouldn't have lived in the first place."
22-06-2018T01:58:30,ZRO4825,"Sage, I found a good pun joke."
22-06-2018T01:59:18,SageSaga,dont you lie to me
22-06-2018T01:59:27,ZRO4825,I did though!
22-06-2018T01:59:41,ZRO4825,"I mean, it has to be good, I didn't come up with it."
22-06-2018T02:00:11,SageSaga,uhggggg- fine lets hear it

22-06-2018T11:55:20,Twokinds,Dunno
22-06-2018T12:04:02,Xexanoth,because the early bird catches the worm...or so people say

22-06-2018T14:05:20,LannAF,How's everyone today so far?
22-06-2018T14:05:25,Rosscoe,tired
22-06-2018T14:05:30,Rosscoe,room mate woke me up with the TV again
22-06-2018T14:05:45,Rosscoe,"couldnt get back to sleep, got hungry, got some bit of groceries for work"
22-06-2018T14:05:51,Rosscoe,now here I am watching the magic happen
22-06-2018T14:06:10,LannAF,groceries are good.
22-06-2018T14:07:10,Pimsan,"Good, watching Chalo, Nekonny and Godai's raffle commissions."
22-06-2018T14:07:22,SageSaga,missing hand!
22-06-2018T14:07:39,SageSaga,fixed
22-06-2018T14:07:40,Pimsan,"want to join, but don't have enough money in my paypal."
22-06-2018T14:07:59,Twokinds,Few
22-06-2018T14:08:16,Twokinds,Hand must have taken a minute to load in.
22-06-2018T14:08:40,Bgrmystr2,should update the renderer speed
22-06-2018T14:08:54,LannAF,*dial-up sounds*
22-06-2018T14:09:03,Bgrmystr2,shh that's too far back
22-06-2018T14:09:06,SageSaga,hands have to have a lot of polys on the high res versions
22-06-2018T14:09:22,Rosscoe,"Dial up is dead, its wireless internet failure noises now"
22-06-2018T14:09:45,Bgrmystr2,the only failure noises are the noises people make when they rage that the internet is out :V
22-06-2018T14:09:53,Pimsan,You know this moment would make a good hand jokes. But i got nothing.
22-06-2018T14:10:11,Rosscoe,"Ugh Sage, dont remind me of hands."
22-06-2018T14:10:19,Rosscoe,I have enough issues sculpting them in 3D XD
22-06-2018T14:10:29,SageSaga,"oh Lann, the place that sell the Rail Passes also sells Wifi hotspot devices - well rents them"
22-06-2018T14:12:58,LannAF,huh
22-06-2018T14:13:02,LannAF,How much?
22-06-2018T14:14:45,SageSaga,50 bucks for 5 days 10 days is like 66 - so its just a few dollars more per day beyond 5
22-06-2018T14:15:28,LannAF,mm
22-06-2018T14:15:34,LannAF,It would be nice to have Wifi
22-06-2018T14:15:44,LannAF,Particularly to find out where tf we'd be
22-06-2018T14:15:53,SageSaga,they dont have free wifi everywhere- too much traffic
22-06-2018T14:15:54,SageSaga,brb
22-06-2018T14:16:43,Rosscoe,in monteral train station
22-06-2018T14:16:51,Rosscoe,"you get disconnected from teh free wifi,"
22-06-2018T14:16:58,Rosscoe,and thats in the top floor of hte terminus
22-06-2018T14:18:57,LannAF,"Honestly, I feel like the original quote I came up with isn't gonna be close to how much we'd need."
22-06-2018T14:19:10,LannAF,It'd probably be at least a grand more unless we got a 5th person.
22-06-2018T14:19:48,Grip,Hello ^^
22-06-2018T14:20:13,LannAF,Howdy Grip
22-06-2018T14:20:18,Rosscoe,Hello Grip!
22-06-2018T14:21:08,LannAF,But even with 5 it'd be dicey.
22-06-2018T14:23:28,SageSaga,back
22-06-2018T14:23:31,LannAF,wb
22-06-2018T14:30:09,Rosscoe,Con trip planning LannAF?

22-06-2018T14:35:46,Twokinds,Space
22-06-2018T14:36:11,SageSaga,... smaller
22-06-2018T14:36:25,Rosscoe,I could use a bigger room
22-06-2018T14:36:33,Rosscoe,maybe like 5 to 6 feet in length
22-06-2018T14:39:37,LannAF,hahahaha Tom and Sage
22-06-2018T14:39:52,LannAF,"It's a vacation trip of sorts, Ross."
22-06-2018T14:42:59,LannAF,I get the feeling Tom wants to go to space.
22-06-2018T14:43:15,SageSaga,he just knows i cant afford it
22-06-2018T14:43:34,LannAF,None of us can afford it
22-06-2018T14:43:35,LannAF,Dx
22-06-2018T14:45:24,SageSaga,that was the joke
22-06-2018T14:45:44,LannAF,Not even him :P

22-06-2018T14:55:06,SageSaga,but seriously- you have any tutorials on large plains landscapes?

22-06-2018T14:55:57,Twokinds,"Hm, not off the top of my head."
22-06-2018T14:56:12,Twokinds,I'd probably find a picture of a hill with colors you like and sample the colors to make your background
22-06-2018T14:56:19,Twokinds,That's what I usually do.
22-06-2018T14:56:46,superwolfart,hi
22-06-2018T14:56:53,SageSaga,yo
22-06-2018T14:57:24,Twokinds,"I'm quite partial to rolling hillscapes, so I use the hills to balance the panel"

22-06-2018T15:06:53,SageSaga,Panther?
22-06-2018T15:07:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Eh he got an emergency wash off but not ok much got on him
22-06-2018T15:07:16,Twokinds,"Sphynx, now."
22-06-2018T15:07:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"As far as I can tell, he’s not balding"
22-06-2018T15:08:13,Twokinds,imagines a cat with a combover
22-06-2018T15:08:29,SpazztasticKiwi,But didn’t even know it had busted till I smelled it
22-06-2018T15:09:25,SpazztasticKiwi,He was already in trouble for starting a fight.
22-06-2018T15:11:00,SpazztasticKiwi,It was all a such a mess I’m not sure how to explain everything. It was just a bit of chaos
22-06-2018T15:11:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"But yes, Bagheera is technically “Panther”. He’s a black cat"
22-06-2018T15:12:02,FoxxTrotter,I would think so. That is what he was in The Jungle Book. :0P
22-06-2018T15:12:18,Dadrobit,Searched for a cat with a comb over. Got a lot of Trump parodies.
22-06-2018T15:12:23,SpazztasticKiwi,He is a mini panther tho
22-06-2018T15:12:36,Dadrobit,"Also, howdy y'all. Just popping in for a hot second."
22-06-2018T15:12:39,FoxxTrotter,"Hey, Dadrobit."
22-06-2018T15:12:56,SpazztasticKiwi,The good thing about nair is that it takes a few minutes for it to sit in the hair and actually remove it
22-06-2018T15:13:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"And you’re not supposed to put it on thick or large patches, and put it at the base on the skin (do not rub in though)"
22-06-2018T15:14:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I was more worried about him spreading it or licking it
22-06-2018T15:15:19,SpazztasticKiwi,And it can cause chemical burns if you’re not careful

22-06-2018T15:21:58,LannAF,"It looks nice, I like the clouds :D"
22-06-2018T15:23:10,Twokinds,:ok_hand:
22-06-2018T15:23:15,Bgrmystr2,One does not simply.. walk into mordor. I'm sure Kaylin will be fine.
22-06-2018T15:23:40,LannAF,haha
22-06-2018T15:23:54,LannAF,"mm, okay"
22-06-2018T15:23:55,SageSaga,so i would try to start from PHF
22-06-2018T15:23:56,LannAF,mt
22-06-2018T15:24:00,SageSaga,:P
22-06-2018T15:24:04,LannAF,hahaha
22-06-2018T15:25:12,Bgrmystr2,"No eye of Sauron, sage?"
22-06-2018T15:25:22,Bgrmystr2,:(
22-06-2018T15:25:50,SageSaga,why would there be an eye of Sauron?
22-06-2018T15:26:30,Bgrmystr2,The real question is.. why would there /not/ be?
22-06-2018T15:26:34,Pimsan,For reference?
22-06-2018T15:26:45,Bgrmystr2,big ol mountain.. twin spires
22-06-2018T15:26:51,Bgrmystr2,what else would go thre?
22-06-2018T15:26:55,Bgrmystr2,there* even
22-06-2018T15:26:57,SageSaga,Legal reasons
22-06-2018T15:27:00,Bgrmystr2,lool
22-06-2018T15:27:05,MatyMaty,it is not barad-dur
22-06-2018T15:27:14,Bgrmystr2,"maybe instead of an eye, you can make it like.. a nose or somethin :V"
22-06-2018T15:27:18,MatyMaty,Barad dur wasn't next to Mt. Tiddy
22-06-2018T15:27:19,Bgrmystr2,or a big mouth that doesn't shut up haha
22-06-2018T15:27:22,LannAF,The nose of Sauron
22-06-2018T15:27:28,Bgrmystr2,xD
22-06-2018T15:27:59,SpazztasticKiwi,“Mt Tiddy”
22-06-2018T15:27:59,Bgrmystr2,"""I can smell you all the way from here.."""
22-06-2018T15:29:15,MatyMaty,"heck, barad dur wasn't even a mountain :P"
22-06-2018T15:29:36,MatyMaty,I think?
22-06-2018T15:31:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Later for now
22-06-2018T15:31:09,ZRO4825,Mt Tiddy.  😂
22-06-2018T15:31:25,MatyMaty,hey Zro
22-06-2018T15:31:29,FoxxTrotter,"C-ya, Kiwi."
22-06-2018T15:31:38,ZRO4825,Hiyas Maty ^^
22-06-2018T15:31:50,Bgrmystr2,lol I saw an anime like that once zro.
22-06-2018T15:31:54,Bgrmystr2,I think I showed it to you xD
22-06-2018T15:37:17,ZRO4825,I've seen a number of anime like that. :P
22-06-2018T15:37:54,ZRO4825,Eiken takes the cake on that matter though 😂
22-06-2018T15:40:55,Bgrmystr2,xD We don't speak of things others would not know about.
22-06-2018T15:44:26,superwolfart,lookink good
22-06-2018T15:44:30,Pimsan,"Going to bed now, night."
22-06-2018T15:44:37,SageSaga,sleep well
22-06-2018T15:44:42,FoxxTrotter,"G'night, Pimsan."
22-06-2018T15:44:48,ZRO4825,Everyone should watch Eiken. It's freakin hilarious. The smallest girl of the main cast has a bust the size of Toyoko and Relm together. 😂
22-06-2018T15:45:09,SageSaga,dont recommend people watch that trash
22-06-2018T15:47:03,ZRO4825,But it's so damned funny for all the wrong reasons 🤣
22-06-2018T15:47:10,sunblaze,ah ok basically harem fanservice trash...
22-06-2018T15:47:23,Twokinds,Good for knowing what not to do
22-06-2018T15:47:26,sunblaze,as if there are not enough series like that :D
22-06-2018T15:48:25,SageSaga,it is trash beyond trash - it's pure garbage
22-06-2018T15:49:34,SageSaga,"if you hold up the sword of Omens and say ""GIve me trash beyond trash!"" it beams Eiken right into your eyes"
22-06-2018T15:49:51,MatyMaty,"uh, it is that bad? I don't think I've ever seen anything of it beyond the memes"
22-06-2018T15:50:21,sunblaze,I stopped reading after 11 year old with biggest boobs of the series. (and it has huge boobs overall)
22-06-2018T15:50:53,ZRO4825,"It's supposed to be trash. It's a parody anime of all the huge titty harem animes. Least that's what I got out of it, lol."
22-06-2018T15:51:21,SageSaga,its like 90% of the animes budget went into animating boobs and it did that horribly
22-06-2018T15:52:09,ZRO4825,"And Sunblaze isn't wrong. Smallest chick on the main cast has titties that technically should outweigh her, lol"
22-06-2018T15:53:27,MatyMaty,geeez
22-06-2018T15:54:26,SageSaga,what kinda school has a bunch of girls have a chocolate banana eating contest as part of a Relay race?
22-06-2018T15:55:06,MatyMaty,XP
22-06-2018T15:55:17,MatyMaty,that anime sounds kinda gross tbh
22-06-2018T15:55:33,ZRO4825,It IS trash. Sage isn't wrong.
22-06-2018T15:56:06,Bgrmystr2,"lol Maty I mean.. it's strange to be sure, but the absurdity of it doesn't make it gross to me"
22-06-2018T15:56:07,SageSaga,some people are trash pandas
22-06-2018T15:56:13,ZRO4825,But it's hilarious trash imo.
22-06-2018T15:57:04,ZRO4825,Partly hilarious BECAUSE it's trash.
22-06-2018T15:57:29,SageSaga,man - I wonder what Rocket would say if he saw a picture of a Raccoon
22-06-2018T15:57:35,MatyMaty,"like Rick and Morty, then? :P"
22-06-2018T15:58:31,SageSaga,"""Holy crap... I am a Raccoon"""
22-06-2018T16:00:31,ZRO4825,lol
22-06-2018T16:35:26,ZRO4825,I need to win the lotto so I can quit working but still afford stuff. 😂
22-06-2018T16:35:44,SageSaga,and help me right?
22-06-2018T16:36:00,ZRO4825,"Definitely would, yup~"
22-06-2018T16:36:50,SageSaga,well hurry up then
22-06-2018T16:37:36,Twokinds,Yes hurry!
22-06-2018T16:37:36,ZRO4825,I'm trying! The lottery isn't cooperating. 🤣
22-06-2018T16:37:38,Twokinds,Time is money!
22-06-2018T16:39:30,SageSaga,get a microwave and a big screen CRT TV and send a text message back in time with the lotto numbers but just make sure SERN doesnt find out
22-06-2018T16:41:25,FoxxTrotter,Maybe I should get a ticket. Mega Millions is $212M for Tuesday's drawing.
22-06-2018T16:41:33,ZRO4825,"I get the feeling that's a reference to something I've not seen, lol"
22-06-2018T16:42:38,ZRO4825,"I just play Powerball when I've got a couple bucks to spare. Any sort of jackpot win would set me for like the next 10-20 years, lol"
22-06-2018T16:43:03,FoxxTrotter,Powerball is $40M for tonight's drawing.
22-06-2018T16:45:11,ZRO4825,"Yeah, see, 40M could set me personally for life just about, lol"
22-06-2018T16:46:42,SageSaga,i think with the right investing 2M should be able to set you for life...
22-06-2018T16:47:00,SageSaga,but im not sure- someone give me 2 million to try it
22-06-2018T16:48:11,FoxxTrotter,I might have it in Monopoly money. ;0P
22-06-2018T16:48:39,ZRO4825,"If I get a lotto win, Sage, I'll let ya try it :P"
22-06-2018T16:49:44,SageSaga,sweet. science thanks you
22-06-2018T16:51:01,eric190,hihi

22-06-2018T16:59:12,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-sad:
22-06-2018T17:00:25,FoxxTrotter,"Yeah, the fire department is sometimes called to assist EMS with CPR on full arrest calls. In this case, the person was already dead when EMS arrived on scene."
22-06-2018T17:01:46,SageSaga,well im done- i think
22-06-2018T17:01:56,FoxxTrotter,"Great job, Sage. :0)"

22-06-2018T20:00:23,CrRAR,ooo
22-06-2018T20:00:39,SpazztasticKiwi,And I feel we all know the Ninja turtles would eat more than one slice a piece
22-06-2018T20:00:44,CrRAR,Basil is the best seasoning
22-06-2018T20:00:51,CrRAR,esp if it's fresh
22-06-2018T20:00:58,CrRAR,tru
22-06-2018T20:01:24,CrRAR,they are the PRE-mutant ninja turtles however

22-06-2018T20:02:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve had pet turtles
22-06-2018T20:03:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Though Rocky more of a catch & release
22-06-2018T20:03:58,SpazztasticKiwi,More of a snake person
22-06-2018T20:04:02,CrRAR,Turtles eat greens typically? Though I imagine snappers are more carnivorous.
22-06-2018T20:04:04,SpazztasticKiwi,And cats
22-06-2018T20:04:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Rocky liked fruits
22-06-2018T20:04:31,CrRAR,"ooo, I kept a garter snake... but that's about it other than fish for a while."
22-06-2018T20:04:34,CrRAR,oh nice

22-06-2018T20:06:04,SpazztasticKiwi,As was King. He was in my sister’s dog’s yard nomming on a frog
22-06-2018T20:06:15,CrRAR,rip frog
22-06-2018T20:06:30,SpazztasticKiwi,He spit the frog out when he was caught
22-06-2018T20:06:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Didn’t want him biting the dog
22-06-2018T20:06:46,CrRAR,haha
22-06-2018T20:06:52,SpazztasticKiwi,And he was a chill snake so we kept him
22-06-2018T20:07:01,SpazztasticKiwi,He watched Mark and Jack with me
22-06-2018T20:07:10,CrRAR,Stress puking: a legitimate strategy
22-06-2018T20:07:15,CrRAR,gotta go fast I guess
