07-09-2018T00:00:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-nibsdance::ctwokinds-florajiggle::ctwokinds-nibsdance:
07-09-2018T00:01:05,Bgrmystr2,that is  game. It sounded like a comic or movie or something
07-09-2018T00:01:12,InTheLionsDen,:ctwokinds-florajiggle::ctwokinds-nibsdance::ctwokinds-florajiggle:
07-09-2018T00:01:48,BadFoMo,"...In the Twokinds future (/Sam&Colin?) world, it's Dragon: the Masquraide?"
07-09-2018T00:02:06,Ordithus,That would get confusing
07-09-2018T00:02:11,Bgrmystr2,"Sage, this is gonna be in color? :O"
07-09-2018T00:02:20,Ordithus,Sure looks it

07-09-2018T00:02:53,JamesBSquirrel3,"Oh well Bgr, that a story. We know now as it is, let's just we can move on continue like this.:ptv-scratch:"
07-09-2018T00:03:03,SageSaga,uhh
07-09-2018T00:03:10,SageSaga,i colored something every stream last month
07-09-2018T00:03:25,Ordithus,"FoMo, we already have The Dragon Masquerade!  Dragon: the Masquerade would just be cruel"
07-09-2018T00:03:46,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: huh
07-09-2018T00:04:00,InTheLionsDen,"And the Masquerade is being held on a boat, when the pixies pass by."
07-09-2018T00:04:02,Destentoserv1ve,?
07-09-2018T00:04:04,Bgrmystr2,Well I have been multitasking for most streams since moving here so
07-09-2018T00:04:19,Ordithus,"Then we could have Masquerade the Dragon, followed by Masquerade, Dragon, The"
07-09-2018T00:04:33,JamesBSquirrel3,Now what? Masquerade of Dragon Crule?

07-09-2018T00:06:24,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-keith8D:
07-09-2018T00:06:44,unsteddyphoenix,Nora looks like she poisoned her husband and got away with it.
07-09-2018T00:07:07,InTheLionsDen,They couldn't prove anything.
07-09-2018T00:07:32,JamesBSquirrel3,Oh wow!:ptv-ohmy: Hunan Lady Nora has intanse dress!?
07-09-2018T00:07:35,Destentoserv1ve,I dont think its nora
07-09-2018T00:07:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Its trace
07-09-2018T00:07:49,BadFoMo,Maybe I should rephrase that/realise that Dragons needing to hide amung Humans/Keidran/Basitins is pointless due to magic maybe still being around in the future.
07-09-2018T00:07:57,JamesBSquirrel3,*Human
07-09-2018T00:08:12,InTheLionsDen,Might this be Reni's mother meeting Reni's soon to be father?
07-09-2018T00:08:46,Bgrmystr2,ooh the bowl :O
07-09-2018T00:09:00,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-excited:

07-09-2018T00:09:31,Bgrmystr2,yesssss
07-09-2018T00:10:08,BadFoMo,"Also, why do I want to listen to Angel by Nightwish?"
07-09-2018T00:10:30,Bgrmystr2,"I don't know fomo, but maybe you should go do that instead of telling us."
07-09-2018T00:10:37,Bgrmystr2,you'd prolly feel better. :)
07-09-2018T00:10:43,Bgrmystr2,take action.
07-09-2018T00:11:28,BadFoMo,"I mean, why does this sketch remind me of that song?"
07-09-2018T00:12:17,JamesBSquirrel3,:ptv-wondering:
07-09-2018T00:12:48,Destentoserv1ve,I think i have an idea of who he is drawing

07-09-2018T00:14:43,Bgrmystr2,"Hey sage, is her shirt grey cuz you took the color directly? Or is that in preparation for shading later?"
07-09-2018T00:14:44,ZRO4825,I iz big moniez. I getz the colorz. :3
07-09-2018T00:15:00,Destentoserv1ve,I didnt remember the name

07-09-2018T00:15:28,ZRO4825,"10% luck, 20% skill, 15% concentrated power of will, 5% pleasure, 50% pain, and a hundred percent reason to remember the name~"

07-09-2018T00:17:08,Bgrmystr2,"you aren't, zro, I was hopin to see if sage would respond but alas :u"

07-09-2018T00:38:58,Ordithus,burn the cheese until it is no more
07-09-2018T00:39:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Nibbling on ice cream can help sooth the burning from puking

07-09-2018T00:44:23,JamesBSquirrel3,Is Fridgirator still not working? Is that why you so fustrated?
07-09-2018T00:45:08,Bgrmystr2,it's either evil cheese or rogue cheese.. cuz evil rogue cheese would imply that it's going rogue from it's evilness.
07-09-2018T00:45:19,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:

07-09-2018T00:50:18,Rosscoe,I'm starting to see alot of characters like this one with the Horn.
07-09-2018T00:50:33,Bgrmystr2,well it's not like horns are rare lol

07-09-2018T00:52:04,ZRO4825,"Well, Yuugi IS kinda powerful..."
07-09-2018T00:52:28,Bgrmystr2,"Oni, Ross?"
07-09-2018T00:52:34,Bgrmystr2,cuz that;'s a fairly common thing
07-09-2018T00:52:42,ZRO4825,"The general idea is the same type of Oni, to be fair."
07-09-2018T00:52:44,Rosscoe,"Only other thing I know the horn for is a ""Summoner's Horn"""
07-09-2018T00:53:04,ZRO4825,FFXI? :3
07-09-2018T00:53:08,Rosscoe,"Ah thats the word I was looking for, Oni"

07-09-2018T00:54:01,ZRO4825,Played the FUCK out of XI though. ^_^

07-09-2018T00:58:49,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
07-09-2018T00:59:30,Rosscoe,Not sure what I just missed
07-09-2018T00:59:32,BadFoMo,Hmm?
07-09-2018T00:59:42,Bgrmystr2,"probably nothing important, Ross"
07-09-2018T00:59:45,BadFoMo,@Rosscoe Same.
07-09-2018T01:00:54,ZRO4825,"Some sort of Ascii art spam. I caught enough of it to go ""That should be done in just a, oh, there it went."""
07-09-2018T01:00:59,SageSaga,it was a failed attempt to post some form of Ascii art
07-09-2018T01:01:18,Bgrmystr2,"Oh, I thought it was a big link or somethin"
07-09-2018T01:01:24,JamesBSquirrel3,I think Sage appears that GhostratBanjo has join but the unnecessary spams out.
07-09-2018T01:01:56,BadFoMo,...What was it going to be?
07-09-2018T01:02:10,ZRO4825,Dunno! =D
07-09-2018T01:02:25,ZRO4825,And the guy apparently didn't stick around long enough to try again either.
07-09-2018T01:02:39,SageSaga,oh- i wrote out the next chapter and a quarter of AI
07-09-2018T01:03:05,BadFoMo,Cool.
07-09-2018T01:03:24,SageSaga,including the Kaylin x Nyna scene
07-09-2018T01:03:31,ZRO4825,Nice =D
07-09-2018T01:03:58,ZRO4825,But have you figured out how you're going to get your convenient censors into place yet?
07-09-2018T01:04:09,Rosscoe,Hmm yea been alot of people jumping on streams and spamming lately
07-09-2018T01:04:14,SageSaga,it's in the script
07-09-2018T01:04:18,Rosscoe,just like on REDDIT.
07-09-2018T01:04:34,Rosscoe,Heres a car sale ad in a scratch built terrain forum
07-09-2018T01:04:51,SageSaga,the script includes information on poses and how a scene should be positioned
07-09-2018T01:05:25,ZRO4825,Excellent~
07-09-2018T01:06:39,SageSaga,the foreplay stuff should be SFC

07-09-2018T01:07:27,SageSaga,do i need to define Foreplay?
07-09-2018T01:07:33,Rosscoe,No no
07-09-2018T01:07:35,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe
07-09-2018T01:07:58,Rosscoe,I'm just a little suprised to read that coming up :ptv-laugh:

07-09-2018T01:10:04,ZRO4825,Wait...did I just do a monthly request without cleavage directly involved? :ptv-wondering:
07-09-2018T01:10:24,unsteddyphoenix,Zro youve really let us all down on this one
07-09-2018T01:10:33,ZRO4825,idk. I think Bgr is pleased.
07-09-2018T01:10:36,Bgrmystr2,It's Yuugi. Does she NEED cleavage?
07-09-2018T01:10:39,ZRO4825,And I'm pleased.
07-09-2018T01:10:46,Dadrobit,Foreplay: The act of hitting a golfball with the sole intention of hitting another person for the giggles.
07-09-2018T01:10:47,ZRO4825,I'm just...surprised at myself.
07-09-2018T01:10:49,unsteddyphoenix,So am I
07-09-2018T01:10:55,unsteddyphoenix,Zro youve really done good on this one

07-09-2018T01:12:49,Rosscoe,I still gota catch up on the latest pages
07-09-2018T01:13:11,Dadrobit,One of these days I'll settle in for a reading of Yosh
07-09-2018T01:13:20,Bgrmystr2,"know that feel, Dadro"
07-09-2018T01:13:21,Dadrobit,"But good lord, that page count."
07-09-2018T01:13:32,ZRO4825,Is worth &lt;3
07-09-2018T01:15:13,unsteddyphoenix,Good luck Dad
07-09-2018T01:15:30,FenceEqualizer,Do it when free Robit
07-09-2018T01:16:09,Twokinds,"Meh, it'll only take you half an hour if you read each page for 1 sec"
07-09-2018T01:16:12,FenceEqualizer,Know i've been wanting to give Sage comic a try for awhile. Just need that free time to binge
07-09-2018T01:16:17,Bgrmystr2,XD tom

07-09-2018T01:16:36,unsteddyphoenix,Load all the pages then quickly click through them
07-09-2018T01:17:02,Bgrmystr2,get a comic reader that displays all the comic pages on ONE page and just scroll to read the next one
07-09-2018T01:17:03,SageSaga,I think its done?
07-09-2018T01:17:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Very Nicely Done

07-09-2018T01:18:45,Bgrmystr2,cuz her cosplay is win :D
07-09-2018T01:18:50,Dadrobit,I feel like that just exemplifies how much of a task it is when you're literally only spending one second a page and it will still take a half hour...
07-09-2018T01:18:52,FenceEqualizer,She reminds me of that oni from monster monosu
07-09-2018T01:19:07,ZRO4825,"There's a reason for that Fence, they're both based off the same mythos :)"
07-09-2018T01:19:09,Bgrmystr2,"Well, Yuugi is an oni so"
07-09-2018T01:19:14,Bgrmystr2,"and yeh, what zro said"
07-09-2018T01:19:23,FenceEqualizer,If you can't commit to one second reading then maybe you're not ready
07-09-2018T01:19:25,ZRO4825,Yuugi's just the better version is all &lt;3
07-09-2018T01:19:28,HobbitGames,Olo
07-09-2018T01:20:00,HobbitGames,How long ago did stream end?
07-09-2018T01:20:06,SageSaga,stream is still going
07-09-2018T01:20:10,FenceEqualizer,True enough. Thinks it's the oni in casual clothes that makes it
07-09-2018T01:20:44,HobbitGames,Okay. Haha
07-09-2018T01:20:51,HobbitGames,Stupid website
07-09-2018T01:22:20,SageSaga,(Do you think he meant Tom's stream?)

07-09-2018T01:27:56,HobbitGames,🤔
07-09-2018T01:28:10,Dadrobit,"Water poisoning, aka, drowning."
07-09-2018T01:30:33,Rosscoe,"Huh, this just in, Netflix is doing what Steam was doing years ago for profile pictures, get avatars based on some of the shows"
07-09-2018T01:31:14,HobbitGames,But what if you watch some......... questionable..... shows
07-09-2018T01:31:52,ZRO4825,"Then you're probably not watching them on Netflix to begin with, no issue. :P"
07-09-2018T01:32:08,HobbitGames,Ik. I dont wven have netflix.

07-09-2018T01:39:35,Rosscoe,Well isn't the lead character in this comic a guy playing as a girl on the game?
07-09-2018T01:39:52,Bgrmystr2,yeah but it's not really a form of transformation
07-09-2018T01:39:55,Bgrmystr2,so it's not the same

07-09-2018T02:26:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,still pretty early for a sage stream
07-09-2018T02:26:34,Rosscoe,Well if I was back on the east caose it be 0325hrs
07-09-2018T02:26:47,Rosscoe,So I guess thats normal
07-09-2018T02:26:56,SageSaga,"""Streaming tonight at 9pm EST! Over at picarto.tv/SageSaga! Usually for like 5-8 hours…"""
07-09-2018T02:27:30,SageSaga,6 hours and 27 minutes now
07-09-2018T02:27:38,ZRO4825,"Yeah, this is like, an early night's end time for Sage, lol"
07-09-2018T02:33:06,Bgrmystr2,can confirm
07-09-2018T02:33:17,Bgrmystr2,sage goes usually a couple hours past now
07-09-2018T02:33:27,Bgrmystr2,ish.
07-09-2018T02:34:40,Rosscoe,oh right being even futher makes all teh difference.
07-09-2018T02:35:38,Rosscoe,man its getting colder early
07-09-2018T02:35:55,Rosscoe,"last September it was mild out at thsi hour, almsot feels like snow weather now"
07-09-2018T02:38:34,SageSaga,not cold here- i went for a swim before stream- the water was like 89 degrees
07-09-2018T02:40:01,Rosscoe,It be the polar bear plunge for me at this hour XD
07-09-2018T02:45:02,Rosscoe,Better then being humid out though
07-09-2018T02:45:05,Rosscoe,thats all August was
07-09-2018T02:45:23,SageSaga,it was 95 with 100% humidity
07-09-2018T02:47:41,Bgrmystr2,"sounds like prettymuch every day of summer here, sage"
07-09-2018T02:47:58,Bgrmystr2,can relate
07-09-2018T02:48:04,SageSaga,well - it is still Summer so :P
07-09-2018T02:48:13,Bgrmystr2,yeh..
07-09-2018T02:48:28,SageSaga,(i secretly want that guy to come back)
07-09-2018T02:48:32,Bgrmystr2,brutal heat + waterlogged air
07-09-2018T02:49:11,Rosscoe,Its only half that here now with little to no humidity
07-09-2018T02:50:19,Rosscoe,Its been nice.
07-09-2018T02:50:27,Rosscoe,Then tie rolls in at night and its extra cold XD
07-09-2018T02:50:30,SageSaga,Bgr- were you around for that guy?
07-09-2018T02:51:48,Bgrmystr2,uhh
07-09-2018T02:51:50,Bgrmystr2,which guy again?
07-09-2018T02:51:58,Bgrmystr2,there were a lot of guys
07-09-2018T02:52:45,SageSaga,"""August is a Fall month"" guy"
07-09-2018T02:52:59,Bgrmystr2,"oh that was recent, wasn't it?"
07-09-2018T02:53:10,SageSaga,a week or 2 ago
07-09-2018T02:53:16,Bgrmystr2,"I remember that conversation yeah, but not who"
07-09-2018T02:53:19,Bgrmystr2,I was there
07-09-2018T02:53:40,SageSaga,oh i got a message from someone I banned
07-09-2018T02:53:44,Bgrmystr2,:O
07-09-2018T02:54:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,nani?
07-09-2018T02:55:03,Rosscoe,That was a funny convo Sage
07-09-2018T02:55:16,Rosscoe,"And now this message, is it from THAT guy again?"
07-09-2018T02:55:31,SageSaga,Let it be understood as follows:  I am a fan of Tom and his work.  I am not a fan of you or your work.
07-09-2018T02:55:52,SageSaga,I will continue to attend Tom's streams regardless of your opinion. It is Tom's right to do as he desires in his own stream. Please do not assert your personal will in his space.
07-09-2018T02:56:41,KiTA,That's a complex issue with multistreams =/
07-09-2018T02:56:49,KiTA,How bad was this guy?
07-09-2018T02:56:59,Bgrmystr2,"well... sage hosts the multistream on friday, not tom, so"
07-09-2018T02:57:00,SageSaga,"""I would recommend you reflect inward on yourself and your attitude."""
07-09-2018T02:57:10,Bgrmystr2,it's not too complex
07-09-2018T02:57:42,Bgrmystr2,When shit gets real and drama happens. I just kinda go into lurk mode
07-09-2018T02:57:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,same tbh
07-09-2018T02:57:53,KiTA,"It kinda is.  I for example didn't know Sage hosted the multistream, since I went to Tom's URL and it loaded the others"
07-09-2018T02:58:00,KiTA,but yeah I find it's best just to lurk
07-09-2018T02:58:21,KiTA,This isn't that guy who was like creating weird author insert twokinds knockoff art was it?  heh
07-09-2018T02:58:31,SageSaga,"""You gave me ridicule and made attacks on my character."" - I attacked his weak argument - no Ad hominem"
07-09-2018T02:58:36,Rosscoe,No point adding to a convo of drama when its gona make the drama'ee get worse
07-09-2018T02:58:48,Bgrmystr2,"don't think so, KiTA, not the same person"
07-09-2018T02:59:17,SageSaga,also I am a moderator for Tom's stream
07-09-2018T02:59:20,Bgrmystr2,there's a lot of questionable characters I find hanging around
07-09-2018T03:00:20,SageSaga,"Bgr - do you get this meme? ""Where's my 60 dollar car?"""
07-09-2018T03:00:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,is that a play on dude wheres my car the movei
07-09-2018T03:00:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,movie even
07-09-2018T03:00:53,unsteddyphoenix,Dont give him a ridicule :(
07-09-2018T03:01:41,Bgrmystr2,"hahaha to be fair, I personally thought that conversation was ridiculous a bit from everyon"
07-09-2018T03:01:45,Bgrmystr2,e
07-09-2018T03:01:49,Bgrmystr2,but yknow
07-09-2018T03:02:00,Bgrmystr2,silly shit happens
07-09-2018T03:02:17,SageSaga,nah this person was arguing that until you can buy a VR headset for 60 bucks then it was a prototype and not fit for mass production
07-09-2018T03:02:30,Bgrmystr2,ah yeah that part
07-09-2018T03:02:47,KiTA,that's what the ban was over? o.O
07-09-2018T03:02:51,SageSaga,now just to be clear- i dont think that's what they actually meant- but it is what they said
07-09-2018T03:03:01,KiTA,what a weird thing to fight about
07-09-2018T03:03:04,SageSaga,and yeah i unbanned them the same night - before they even messaged me
07-09-2018T03:03:25,SageSaga,"otherwise he would have been messaging me about ""Why cant i watch toms stream?!"""
07-09-2018T03:03:47,SageSaga,"its like ""oh yeah- im a mod on his stream too so when i ban you on mine- it bans you there too"""
07-09-2018T03:03:54,Bgrmystr2,Does it? :o
07-09-2018T03:04:01,SageSaga,yep
07-09-2018T03:04:16,Bgrmystr2,is it only cuz you're a mod on his stream as well?
07-09-2018T03:04:28,SageSaga,yep
07-09-2018T03:04:31,Bgrmystr2,okay
07-09-2018T03:04:45,Bgrmystr2,+1 knowledge
07-09-2018T03:06:13,SageSaga,so i have banned some people on both and left them banned- only to get angry twitter messages XD
07-09-2018T03:06:46,unsteddyphoenix,We already knew that bgr
07-09-2018T03:06:52,unsteddyphoenix,"And, lol"
07-09-2018T03:06:54,SageSaga,"""I wasnt there for you! I was watching Tom! How dare you ban me from Tom! I dont care about YOUR RULES!"""
07-09-2018T03:08:14,Bgrmystr2,"well, before it didn't do anything cuz one streamer banning someone from a multi didn't ban them from the other streamer pages"
07-09-2018T03:08:22,Bgrmystr2,but sage being a mod for tom makes sense
07-09-2018T03:08:54,Bgrmystr2,cuz I don't think it would ban someone from nero's stream if he was here during a multi
07-09-2018T03:09:00,Bgrmystr2,cuz sage prolly isn't a mod for him
07-09-2018T03:09:19,ZRO4825,inb4 Sage is
07-09-2018T03:09:29,SageSaga,"ive warned people before - ""Hey look - i know you dont care about my work- but if you break the rules and i ban you- it will ban you from Tom's stream too"" ""What?! That's not fair!"" ""Then just follow the rules"" ""Fine"""
07-09-2018T03:09:32,Bgrmystr2,"I'm just using it as an example, zro :U"
07-09-2018T03:09:32,SageSaga,had that a few times
07-09-2018T03:10:07,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, it's not like I can't see where they're comin from"
07-09-2018T03:10:11,Bgrmystr2,but
07-09-2018T03:10:19,Bgrmystr2,"since you host the multi, thems the rules"
07-09-2018T03:10:34,SageSaga,and the rules arent that hard to follow
07-09-2018T03:10:40,ZRO4825,"Well, on top of that, it's pretty much the exact same rules in *nearly every stream*"
07-09-2018T03:10:44,Bgrmystr2,you've been doin the multi since before I even started watching you guys.
07-09-2018T03:10:58,ZRO4825,I've seen artists who don't even take part in Sage's stuff EVER have the exact same rules.
07-09-2018T03:11:22,ZRO4825,"And it's pretty much always a variation on the basics. Don't be a dick, don't link without permission."
07-09-2018T03:11:34,Bgrmystr2,I joined back in.. hmm.. late 2015?
07-09-2018T03:11:54,SageSaga,the linking stuff is important because when we started- we had people coming in and linking viruses - no joke
07-09-2018T03:12:17,ZRO4825,"Yup, I remember you've mentioned it before."
07-09-2018T03:12:30,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, zro, that's likely a standard across all streamers, not artists and not just here on picarto"
07-09-2018T03:12:45,Bgrmystr2,"cuz ppl be dicks, and ppl post spam links"
07-09-2018T03:12:50,ZRO4825,"Exactly, so why is it that Tom's stream goers seem to be the only ones who wanna throw fits about it?"
07-09-2018T03:13:06,Bgrmystr2,cuz tom doesn't have a ask before link rule
07-09-2018T03:13:18,ZRO4825,Then FFS put one in.
07-09-2018T03:13:26,Bgrmystr2,but he doesn't need to
07-09-2018T03:13:29,ZRO4825,"Then people won't have ""But it's not Tom's rule!"" to fall back on as an excuse."
07-09-2018T03:14:12,Bgrmystr2,it's the user's responsibility. :u
07-09-2018T03:14:38,ZRO4825,"Also, Sage, I hate Arena quests in MHW. I hate being stuck with their equipment sets. Give me my damned Earplugs and Stun resistance back assholes! :joy:"
07-09-2018T03:15:14,SageSaga,dont need Stun Resist
07-09-2018T03:15:27,SageSaga,Earplugs are fine but Stun resist? Nah man
07-09-2018T03:15:43,SageSaga,also the Arenas are for a challenge - aint no easy mode!
07-09-2018T03:15:45,ZRO4825,"I do. My dodging isn't always up to par, especially if I'm not on Charge Blade, lol."
07-09-2018T03:16:12,SageSaga,Mihari and I are A Rank them all
07-09-2018T03:16:19,ZRO4825,Nice =D
07-09-2018T03:16:24,SageSaga,A Ranking* we arent done yet
07-09-2018T03:16:26,Bgrmystr2,"can the monsters stunlock you? cuz if so, then yeah I can understand some kind of resistance or dampening of stun effect"
07-09-2018T03:16:34,Bgrmystr2,"but if they can't stunlock you, then I dunno"
07-09-2018T03:16:44,SageSaga,the stun is different from most stun locking things
07-09-2018T03:16:59,Rosscoe,I need to get bac kto MHW
07-09-2018T03:17:03,ZRO4825,"They can't, Bgr, but if you take enough hits inside a span of time (or sometimes just a bad one period it seems), you get stunned. And monsters LOVE to just be like ""Oh look, let me wind up this really hard hitting attack...."""
07-09-2018T03:17:03,SageSaga,the stun effect is if you get hit and knocked down 3 times in a row or in quick succession you become dizzy
07-09-2018T03:17:06,Rosscoe,Dev's fixed quite a few bugs
07-09-2018T03:17:39,Bgrmystr2,but that seems like it's something that can be avoided
07-09-2018T03:17:45,ZRO4825,It can
07-09-2018T03:17:48,SageSaga,so if you get knocked 2 times in a row- you just gotta play more safe for a bit
07-09-2018T03:17:50,ZRO4825,Learn to dodge everything.
07-09-2018T03:18:08,Bgrmystr2,ahh.. so basically getgud
07-09-2018T03:18:11,Bgrmystr2,kinda deal
07-09-2018T03:18:22,ZRO4825,"Much as I detest that phrasing, yes, I suppose so."
07-09-2018T03:18:35,SageSaga,Im all for earplugs though- sometimes monsters in MHW will get into a Roar Loop
07-09-2018T03:19:23,Bgrmystr2,yeah same zro
07-09-2018T03:19:27,Bgrmystr2,I feel you on that
07-09-2018T03:19:38,SageSaga,btw though- you can evade roars too XD
07-09-2018T03:19:42,Rosscoe,I'm on my first big mosnter hunt in the spore zone
07-09-2018T03:19:52,unsteddyphoenix,wait how
07-09-2018T03:20:05,Bgrmystr2,aren't roars like.. a large kind of AoE thing?
07-09-2018T03:20:08,Bgrmystr2,how do you avoid?
07-09-2018T03:20:35,SageSaga,invulnerability frames
07-09-2018T03:20:46,Bgrmystr2,I know a lot of games with stuff like that and they tend to stay on the unavoidable side
07-09-2018T03:20:53,Bgrmystr2,and that's just.. a lil ridiculous xD
07-09-2018T03:21:08,SageSaga,theres even a skill that extends your I-frames
07-09-2018T03:21:18,SageSaga,Evade Window Up
07-09-2018T03:22:14,SageSaga,but a roar like anything else is also an attack- its hit box though is just an expanding sphere
07-09-2018T03:22:32,SageSaga,so if you time it right- you can evade or block it - and continue attacking
07-09-2018T03:22:47,Bgrmystr2,can you hide behind stuff and it won't hit you? or does it go through objects?
07-09-2018T03:22:50,SageSaga,or even better- use it to strengthen your attacks
07-09-2018T03:22:58,ZRO4825,wut?
07-09-2018T03:23:07,Rosscoe,I beleive roars are blocked by objects
07-09-2018T03:23:20,Rosscoe,But some rea's nothing to hide behind
07-09-2018T03:23:23,SageSaga,Evasion Mantle! When you evade while wearing it - it makes it easier to evade stuff and you get an attack boost!
07-09-2018T03:23:28,Rosscoe,alot of trees are far too large ot get around in time
07-09-2018T03:23:53,SageSaga,oh also you can Shoulder check a roar
07-09-2018T03:24:15,SageSaga,you can shoulder check an explosion too - its so awesome
07-09-2018T03:24:24,ZRO4825,Shoulder check's the only way I've been able to nullify a roar outside of ear plugs
07-09-2018T03:24:35,ZRO4825,"And people keep saying there's i-frames int he rolls but I've yet to personally see it, lol"
07-09-2018T03:25:22,SageSaga,"""Oh no! The monster is about to use its explosion power! What do you do?"" A - Run, B - Block, C - Perfect Evade or D - FREAKN SHOULDER CHARGE THAT EXPOSION!"
07-09-2018T03:26:50,jonasfull,heyo heyo
07-09-2018T03:26:56,SageSaga,yo
07-09-2018T03:28:34,Rosscoe,Everyone says to run the main story solo
07-09-2018T03:28:53,Rosscoe,Yet I'll invite my friends in ayway and help each other out cause more fun
07-09-2018T03:30:11,JeremySenpai,:cjeremysenpai-Yo:
07-09-2018T03:30:33,SageSaga,i cant make out that gif
07-09-2018T03:30:47,JeremySenpai,o/
07-09-2018T03:31:05,SageSaga,yo
07-09-2018T03:31:12,Rosscoe,its a side ways hand wave
07-09-2018T03:31:26,SageSaga,"yeah but im like ""Have i seen this before?"""
07-09-2018T03:31:28,JeremySenpai,and its the lewd King Kazuma
07-09-2018T03:32:02,ZRO4825,"And yeah, Ross, it's quicker to do main content solo. You don't have to wait/rejoin for a bunch of cutscene delays."
07-09-2018T03:32:21,Bgrmystr2,King Kazuma from......?
07-09-2018T03:32:41,SageSaga,Kazuma is a pretty common name in anime
07-09-2018T03:32:50,Bgrmystr2,..yeah
07-09-2018T03:33:04,SageSaga,is it the one from Konosuba?
07-09-2018T03:33:24,Rosscoe,and stream play back is going to shit. &gt; Switchs to MP4&lt;
07-09-2018T03:33:36,JeremySenpai,yep Konosuba
07-09-2018T03:33:38,Bgrmystr2,does mp4 even work? lol
07-09-2018T03:33:39,SageSaga,well stream is pretty much done
07-09-2018T03:33:46,SageSaga,well correction - it is done
07-09-2018T03:33:49,SageSaga,im finished
07-09-2018T03:34:03,Bgrmystr2,"cuz when I switch to mp4, it automatically switches back to HLS and tries to load the stream"
07-09-2018T03:34:27,ZRO4825,&lt;3
07-09-2018T03:34:36,ZRO4825,I like how that one turned out. =D
07-09-2018T03:34:40,Bgrmystr2,that Yuugi is so nice
07-09-2018T03:34:46,unsteddyphoenix,Kazuma kazuma!
07-09-2018T03:34:51,unsteddyphoenix,Good work sage

07-09-2018T03:35:26,JeremySenpai,Hoi this is Kazuma
07-09-2018T03:35:28,unsteddyphoenix,Really?
07-09-2018T03:35:29,Rosscoe,Everything blends in so smoothly
07-09-2018T03:35:38,unsteddyphoenix,Is this the half-year countdown
07-09-2018T03:35:54,Rosscoe,Naughyt nauhgty
07-09-2018T03:35:55,SageSaga,so long as the scripts dont change much

07-09-2018T03:36:31,SageSaga,Page 19-21 of Chapter 5 is naughty stuff with nyna and Kaylin
07-09-2018T03:36:42,Rosscoe,&gt;:3
07-09-2018T03:37:00,SageSaga,"including the always sexy ""Fade to black"""
07-09-2018T03:37:05,Bgrmystr2,so... March 6th 2019?
07-09-2018T03:37:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Love that song
07-09-2018T03:37:11,SageSaga,because we all know whats happening when it fades to black
07-09-2018T03:37:21,Bgrmystr2,cuz that's 26 weeks from now.
07-09-2018T03:37:29,Bgrmystr2,"Wednesday, specifically"
07-09-2018T03:37:37,SageSaga,that should be right then
07-09-2018T03:37:45,unsteddyphoenix,Thats pretty specific planning
07-09-2018T03:37:47,Bgrmystr2,we have a long way to go..
07-09-2018T03:37:49,unsteddyphoenix,Impressive
07-09-2018T03:38:13,SageSaga,i dont generally miss updates and i have it all written already
07-09-2018T03:38:16,Bgrmystr2,unless you increase the amount of pages you make for AI to more than one per week
07-09-2018T03:38:19,ZRO4825,"Personally I like when instead of fading to black you get a random off-screen ""Oh my"" or something and then it's like ""And then they boinked!"""
07-09-2018T03:38:20,Bgrmystr2,then yeah
07-09-2018T03:38:24,Bgrmystr2,that's when it happens
07-09-2018T03:38:55,SageSaga,even if i change the script wording a lot it should still be the exact same time frame
07-09-2018T03:39:02,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh: That bird though
07-09-2018T03:39:17,SageSaga,bird?
07-09-2018T03:39:50,ZRO4825,"I believe Bgr's referring to an image I have, who just looks kinda angry and it says ""AND THEN THEY FUCKED!!"""
07-09-2018T03:40:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lewd
07-09-2018T03:40:43,Dadrobit,Questionable Content
07-09-2018T03:40:54,SageSaga,i get to draw people in wet clothing soon on Yosh
07-09-2018T03:40:58,Rosscoe,Sage building the hype train
07-09-2018T03:41:13,ZRO4825,yay wet clothes!
07-09-2018T03:41:16,SageSaga,The hype train starts 6 months before you get to the stop!
07-09-2018T03:41:18,ZRO4825,Toyoko? o.o
07-09-2018T03:41:24,Bgrmystr2,Zro nailed my reference
07-09-2018T03:41:31,unsteddyphoenix,yeah thats the one dad
07-09-2018T03:41:35,SageSaga,no Zro- you arent reading the comic?
07-09-2018T03:41:49,SageSaga,i already did Toyoko in a wet t-shirt though- twice
07-09-2018T03:41:50,ZRO4825,"I am, but I can hope anyway."
07-09-2018T03:42:06,ZRO4825,you say this Sage as if my desire for wet t-shirt Toyoko can be diminished
07-09-2018T03:42:49,ZRO4825,"But yeah, the upcoming pages do look like fun =D"
07-09-2018T03:43:37,ZRO4825,There's one of'em! &lt;3

07-09-2018T12:39:05,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds How is life?
07-09-2018T12:49:57,Twokinds,I'm okay
07-09-2018T12:54:18,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds I've started Undertale!
07-09-2018T12:57:14,Twokinds,Nice
07-09-2018T12:59:01,CrimsonQuill,"@Twokinds And despite the internet, the only Spoiler I know concerns Flowey-besides that, I'm totally blind!"
07-09-2018T12:59:23,CrimsonQuill,I saw your Undertale fanart on Deviantart though-and I really like Toriel.

07-09-2018T13:25:18,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds Beautifully done. What tea is she drinking?
07-09-2018T13:30:52,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-kingtea: Blood
07-09-2018T13:34:15,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds Which sort?
07-09-2018T13:34:50,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds Because some Vampires in theDiscworld
07-09-2018T13:35:01,CrimsonQuill,substitute in cow or sheep blood
07-09-2018T13:35:07,CrimsonQuill,Or try cocoa instead
07-09-2018T13:35:10,CrimsonQuill,Black Ribboners
07-09-2018T13:35:21,CrimsonQuill,Or perhaps it's blood orange.
07-09-2018T13:35:25,CrimsonQuill,Or blood kelp.
07-09-2018T13:35:38,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds I'm sorry! I'm rambling again!
07-09-2018T13:37:36,Twokinds,Keidran
07-09-2018T13:37:50,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds WHAAAAA
07-09-2018T13:38:08,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds Oooohhhhkaaaayyy
07-09-2018T13:39:42,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds I do want to say something to you however...Please would you mind hearing (or rather reading) it? Just something I feel I need to say.
07-09-2018T13:42:44,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds I promise it isn't anything weird.
07-09-2018T13:46:47,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds hello?
07-09-2018T13:48:02,Mihari,"Most people find it bothersome to be constantly pinged, and if you really have something to say, just say it, if he reads it, he reads it, if not... well that's that."
07-09-2018T13:48:44,CrimsonQuill,@Mihari Oh.
07-09-2018T13:48:56,CrimsonQuill,"@Mihari Okay, thanks."
07-09-2018T13:51:06,CrimsonQuill,"@Twokinds I'll just say it. Your comic means a lot to me. Before I started it, I was seriously depressed, and at an all time low because of college pressure and a problem with my way of thinking."
07-09-2018T13:51:42,CrimsonQuill,"Reading this comic helped me break out of a soul-crushing loop. What's more, it opened up awhole new world to me."
07-09-2018T13:52:05,CrimsonQuill,"I'm discovering new webcomics, trying out new things-even thinking of starting my own comic."
07-09-2018T13:52:46,iliar,I like this sketch with Human Nora. But it create problem for me. Recently I ordered a fan art with Human Nora in a very similar pose. A slightly different design of the dress and she had to keep the TDM mask in her hand.
07-09-2018T13:53:22,CrimsonQuill,"@Twokinds So, in short, Thank you, Tom, for your comic. You (and your brother) mean a great deal. It's a wonderful comic, and thank you."
07-09-2018T13:53:29,iliar,So now I probably need to change the order.
07-09-2018T13:53:31,CrimsonQuill,That's all I'll say.
07-09-2018T13:55:36,Twokinds,"I'm glad to hear I could help, CrimsonQuill!"
07-09-2018T13:55:54,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds Thank you. For everything.
07-09-2018T13:56:34,CrimsonQuill,"@Twokinds PS-Tell Nora that Earl Grey, with a splash of milk, goes excellently with a biscuit."
07-09-2018T13:56:43,CrimsonQuill,It'd really brighten up her day.
07-09-2018T13:56:49,Xenotater,Eyyy sage
07-09-2018T13:57:28,CrimsonQuill,@SageSaga oh hello Sage. I've finally started your webcomics.
07-09-2018T13:57:35,MatyMaty,o/
07-09-2018T13:57:38,SageSaga,howdy
07-09-2018T13:57:47,SageSaga,"hey Maty, good luck Quill :P"
07-09-2018T13:58:11,MatyMaty,"You will have a lot to read, Quill :P"
07-09-2018T13:58:38,CrimsonQuill,I know. I'm still only in2006 for Yosh.
07-09-2018T13:58:47,CrimsonQuill,And then there's Artificial Incident!
07-09-2018T13:58:55,CrimsonQuill,"So many webcomics, so little time..."
07-09-2018T13:59:26,MatyMaty,I'd suggest start reading A.I first and take Yosh! more slowly.
07-09-2018T13:59:47,CrimsonQuill,Oh.
07-09-2018T13:59:58,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I've made one mistake right off the bat."
07-09-2018T14:00:15,MatyMaty,No mistake :P that's just what I would do
07-09-2018T14:00:38,CrimsonQuill,"May I make a comic suggestion to you guys? It's not a webcomic, but it is one of the finest comics I've ever read. Twokinds share's the #1 spot with it."
07-09-2018T14:01:09,MatyMaty,as long as you are not promoting your own stuff I think it is okay
07-09-2018T14:01:18,MatyMaty,just don't link
07-09-2018T14:01:19,CrimsonQuill,"It's not mine, no."
07-09-2018T14:01:33,CrimsonQuill,I haven't even started my concept for my idea yet.
07-09-2018T14:01:38,CrimsonQuill,But it is really good.
07-09-2018T14:01:58,CrimsonQuill,It's called Calvin and Hobbes-it's a newspaper comic by Bill Watterson.
07-09-2018T14:02:15,MatyMaty,...I think everyone knows Calvin and Hobbes :P
07-09-2018T14:02:19,SageSaga,wait- are there people who dont know Calvin and Hobbes?
07-09-2018T14:02:30,CrimsonQuill,"Well, there are-in my College campus."
07-09-2018T14:02:39,CrimsonQuill,I have the complete collection in hardback.
07-09-2018T14:02:44,CrimsonQuill,Which my Dad got e.
07-09-2018T14:02:49,CrimsonQuill,He's the reason I read it.
07-09-2018T14:03:21,MatyMaty,aaah
07-09-2018T14:04:22,CrimsonQuill,I read the entire collection on average about once a year.
07-09-2018T14:04:32,FoxxTrotter,I like Get Fuzzy better. :0P
07-09-2018T14:05:03,CrimsonQuill,@SageSaga I like your music.
07-09-2018T14:05:19,SageSaga,Thanks
07-09-2018T14:05:40,CrimsonQuill,"@SageSaga Are any of your comics in books, like Twokinds?"
07-09-2018T14:06:20,iliar,One question worries me very much. How canonical Human Nora?
07-09-2018T14:06:32,iliar,"I mean we know she is shape-shifter, so technically any form could be canon. But did she ever take this form?"
07-09-2018T14:06:38,SageSaga,not yet- Yosh wont be in book format but I plan to print AI
07-09-2018T14:06:49,CrimsonQuill,"@SageSaga Ah, alright."
07-09-2018T14:07:10,CrimsonQuill,"I'm actually still waiting for my Twokinds Volume for, which I pre-ordered in APril."
07-09-2018T14:07:42,CrimsonQuill,"I find the book forms to be nicest...just to feel the crinkle of the page as you turn it, the weight of the book in your hands..."
07-09-2018T14:07:58,CrimsonQuill,But I love the webcomic format too. You can see feeds etc.
07-09-2018T14:10:53,MatyMaty,A Yosh! book would be like
07-09-2018T14:10:58,MatyMaty,Phone directory sized XD
07-09-2018T14:11:06,CrimsonQuill,I can guess.
07-09-2018T14:11:21,iliar,I never understood this real books fetish.
07-09-2018T14:12:13,Grip,hi
07-09-2018T14:12:41,CrimsonQuill,@GripHello
07-09-2018T14:12:45,CrimsonQuill,@Grip Hello
07-09-2018T14:12:50,SageSaga,When Yosh is finished i might go back and rewrite and redraw it into a 500 page series
07-09-2018T14:13:07,CrimsonQuill,"WOAH! As in, redraw from scratch?"
07-09-2018T14:13:08,Grip,How far is it close to finishing?
07-09-2018T14:13:13,iliar,"Of course, I also pre-ordered the 4th volume. But I did it only for the collection. For real use, digital versions are much more convenient."
07-09-2018T14:13:31,CrimsonQuill,@Iliar I pre-ordered it for three reasons.
07-09-2018T14:13:38,CrimsonQuill,First: It's an actual Book.
07-09-2018T14:13:45,CrimsonQuill,Second: The signed print.
07-09-2018T14:14:05,MatyMaty,"well, while a lot of people think real books are better, most don't realize how expensive and troublesome is to print books"
07-09-2018T14:14:25,CrimsonQuill,Third: I like to have hard copies of things.
07-09-2018T14:14:40,MatyMaty,"most freelance artist cannot afford it, and those who do often do it as a personal goal of sorts"
07-09-2018T14:14:43,CrimsonQuill,I'm from a household that spent most of our childhoods reading books.
07-09-2018T14:14:46,MatyMaty,rather than as an investment
07-09-2018T14:14:49,SageSaga,but its a lot easier to convince someone to give you money if you give them something physical in return
07-09-2018T14:14:58,CrimsonQuill,True...
07-09-2018T14:15:01,MatyMaty,"That's good Quill, but think about it"
07-09-2018T14:15:06,CrimsonQuill,I do.
07-09-2018T14:15:25,MatyMaty,Printing books is not cheap}
07-09-2018T14:15:43,CrimsonQuill,I understand that. I can understand the delay.
07-09-2018T14:15:51,MatyMaty,is not just the delay
07-09-2018T14:15:52,CrimsonQuill,It must be realy busy in the office...
07-09-2018T14:15:56,CrimsonQuill,really
07-09-2018T14:16:08,CrimsonQuill,"Sorting things out, what goes where-like a post office."
07-09-2018T14:16:18,CrimsonQuill,And I've been inside the workings of one.
07-09-2018T14:16:30,MatyMaty,"if people were like ""I prefer only printed stuff"" they would miss on so much stuff"
07-09-2018T14:16:53,CrimsonQuill,"I know that too-I do like books, but you can't exactly print a video.."
07-09-2018T14:16:59,CrimsonQuill,I like a healthy balance.
07-09-2018T14:17:05,CrimsonQuill,But I do love books...
07-09-2018T14:17:05,MatyMaty,and there's a similar issue the other way around. Webcomics are almost always free to read
07-09-2018T14:17:13,CrimsonQuill,So one needs patrons.
07-09-2018T14:17:45,MatyMaty,Yes
07-09-2018T14:17:54,CrimsonQuill,"I'm actually a patron for Tom at the moment. I'm not doing too much, though, because I'm on a budget."
07-09-2018T14:18:06,MatyMaty,But also not all readers can afford to purchase books on a regular basis
07-09-2018T14:18:11,Rosscoe,Good evenings!
07-09-2018T14:18:16,Rosscoe,Hoi Maty!
07-09-2018T14:18:17,CrimsonQuill,Good evening
07-09-2018T14:18:20,Rosscoe,Hows Puppers?
07-09-2018T14:18:30,MatyMaty,sick as hell but I'll live
07-09-2018T14:18:32,MatyMaty,I hope!
07-09-2018T14:18:46,Rosscoe,ECK
07-09-2018T14:18:53,Rosscoe,keep isolated!
07-09-2018T14:19:02,CrimsonQuill,"@Maty I'm actually a case in point. I only got those books for myself as a birthday present, and I won't be getting another big purchase for a long time."
07-09-2018T14:19:03,Rosscoe,Drink lots of fluids
07-09-2018T14:19:12,MatyMaty,see?
07-09-2018T14:19:26,CrimsonQuill,@MatyMaty what's wrong?
07-09-2018T14:19:30,iliar,I understand. Sometimes I think about printing one copy TDM for myself and have already learned the prices. Printing one copy on industrial equipment is VERY expensive.
07-09-2018T14:19:36,iliar,Probably printing a lot of copies is cheaper. But it's still expensive.
07-09-2018T14:19:37,Grip,Liking the comic Sage. I am curious what animal the two chimera's are that are with Kate and Phil. Horse and rabbit?
07-09-2018T14:19:45,CrimsonQuill,@MatyMaty are you alright

07-09-2018T14:20:12,CrimsonQuill,@MatyMaty I do love digital art...I hope I've not made the wrong impression...

07-09-2018T14:21:30,CrimsonQuill,It's so expensive.
07-09-2018T14:21:31,MatyMaty,"so thinking something is better just because is printed on paper, well. Is not a good logic."
07-09-2018T14:21:41,CrimsonQuill,I don't use that logic anyhow.
07-09-2018T14:21:47,SageSaga,Grip - yep the girl is a Horse and the guy is a bunny

07-09-2018T15:06:41,Bgrmystr2,haha
07-09-2018T15:06:43,SageSaga,XD
07-09-2018T15:06:46,SageSaga,Zro - no
07-09-2018T15:06:50,Bgrmystr2,"connecting fantasy with reality a bit there, zro"
07-09-2018T15:07:05,ZRO4825,What? It's a valid question given the conversation! 😂
07-09-2018T15:07:14,Bgrmystr2,xD mmhmmmm sure
07-09-2018T15:07:30,SageSaga,now that said- the story was really well done- the creep factor was high but it was done very well dramatically
07-09-2018T15:07:42,ZRO4825,She might've been using the anime as an outlet!
07-09-2018T15:07:57,Bgrmystr2,it's just a story lol
07-09-2018T15:08:03,SageSaga,"though i was like ""I dont think i can keep watching this-"" When the girl was like ""Should we kill ourselves?"""
07-09-2018T15:08:08,LannAF,jesus
07-09-2018T15:08:23,Bgrmystr2,lol sage that's.. a bit much
07-09-2018T15:08:25,phil199,took a turn to the dark
07-09-2018T15:08:36,SageSaga,its a drama not a comedy
07-09-2018T15:09:19,Bgrmystr2,lol Tom's stream still mute.. Looked like he was bouncing to nothing
07-09-2018T15:09:37,TerraTheWizard,:thinking:

07-09-2018T15:10:49,LannAF,I don't hear anything either
07-09-2018T15:10:52,Twokinds,No one mentioned it
07-09-2018T15:11:01,Bgrmystr2,I LITERALLY said so

07-09-2018T15:15:23,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
07-09-2018T15:16:27,SageSaga,I woke up today kinda excited that I would get to do the werewolf thing in the DnD game tonight- only to remember we dont have dnd tonight T_T
07-09-2018T15:16:44,Twokinds,We don't?

07-09-2018T15:18:27,FoxxTrotter,:0)
07-09-2018T15:18:28,LannAF,aw
07-09-2018T15:18:34,LannAF,we should play something instead tonight then
07-09-2018T15:18:40,LannAF,If you both get your work dones
07-09-2018T15:19:00,phil199,the moment you realize that you can´t play something like dnd because you don´t have friends...
07-09-2018T15:19:02,SageSaga,i made some plans but i dont know if they are gonna work
07-09-2018T15:20:12,mingun,"@Twokinds, Tom, I'm wondering, if page from stream from 2018-07-28 with not understanding Natani was published?"
07-09-2018T15:20:16,Bgrmystr2,presuming the hurricane doesn't smack sage in the face
07-09-2018T15:20:59,SageSaga,Hurricane?
07-09-2018T15:21:00,Twokinds,no
07-09-2018T15:21:05,SageSaga,aww crap i forgot those were a thing
07-09-2018T15:21:10,Twokinds,That was a side comic page

07-09-2018T15:21:22,Bgrmystr2,"Tropical Storm Florence, Sage"
07-09-2018T15:21:38,Bgrmystr2,"it's heading towards the east coast, gonna probably gonna be a major hurricane by the time it reaches"
07-09-2018T15:21:39,SageSaga,That's not a hurricane
07-09-2018T15:21:43,phil199,... how can you forget sth big like a hurricane? :thinking:
07-09-2018T15:21:50,Bgrmystr2,it's already predicted to be large
07-09-2018T15:21:54,mingun,"From ""Patron Comic #1"" or another?"
07-09-2018T15:22:20,SageSaga,maybe Godzilla will come in and block it
07-09-2018T15:22:34,HeresyArtStream,Those three middle panels are going to be highly exploitable. :V
07-09-2018T15:22:41,Corinthian,Indeed
07-09-2018T15:22:48,FrSpaceWolf,"Hey Tom, I was part of the 1st 200 to get the vol 4 TK book but never got the signed poster with it. Havn't been able to contact the site either"

07-09-2018T15:39:31,Corinthian,She's just standing there. Menacingly!
07-09-2018T15:39:44,HeresyArtStream,I will be without internets for a while. :o
07-09-2018T15:39:48,phil199,one wrong action and everything goes south
07-09-2018T15:39:51,HeresyArtStream,I need to change modems
07-09-2018T15:40:03,Zero08,Welcome back Sage :D
07-09-2018T15:40:05,phil199,how long will it take?
07-09-2018T15:40:07,Corinthian,Oh no
07-09-2018T15:41:00,HeresyArtStream,Basically my housemate has to take our modem to the Comcast store so that they can give us a new one.
07-09-2018T15:41:24,Corinthian,I hope you'll get the new one very soon.
07-09-2018T15:41:30,Bgrmystr2,"ew, you guys have to go to them?"
07-09-2018T15:41:34,phil199,better then waiting a week for the replacement to be shipped
07-09-2018T15:41:47,Bgrmystr2,"Wow, that's even worse, phil"
07-09-2018T15:42:08,phil199,I was almost 6 weeks out of internet because of stuff like that
07-09-2018T15:42:18,Bgrmystr2,"when we had our modem replaced, a guy came out from Cox Cable, disconnected the box, put the new one in, took about an hour, and it was all set up and running again"
07-09-2018T15:42:50,Bgrmystr2,Do you live like.. 20 hours from civilization? lol
07-09-2018T15:42:53,SageSaga,when mine went out i bought a real one off of amazon and did one day shipping
07-09-2018T15:43:14,phil199,"yee, that´s the way Sage"
07-09-2018T15:44:03,SageSaga,got better speeds than the old one but one day they shut off our internet and said we are using an unsupported device
07-09-2018T15:44:29,phil199,.... they can do that?
07-09-2018T15:44:48,Nekonny,o/
07-09-2018T15:44:53,phil199,hi
07-09-2018T15:44:53,Bgrmystr2,technically they can do that. Is it legal to do that? I dunno
07-09-2018T15:44:56,FoxxTrotter,"Heya, Neko."
07-09-2018T15:45:11,Bgrmystr2,heya Ron
07-09-2018T15:45:14,phil199,I know from my provider that they don´t care
07-09-2018T15:45:15,Nekonny,heya eveyone
07-09-2018T15:45:15,SageSaga,they claimed that the modem just doesnt work on the network
07-09-2018T15:45:25,phil199,that´s some real bs
07-09-2018T15:45:29,Zero08,Hi Neko :D
07-09-2018T15:45:32,SageSaga,"so when i was like ""Its been working fine for the past 4 months"""
07-09-2018T15:45:40,Nekonny,"what, they wanted you to rent theirs?"
07-09-2018T15:45:46,Bgrmystr2,"sounds like some bs to me, yeah, if it just randomly stopped working, they just disconnected it on purpose"
07-09-2018T15:45:53,Bgrmystr2,"prolly, Ron"
07-09-2018T15:46:09,TheSexyBeast,"Exactly, they just wanted more money for their crappy equipment"
07-09-2018T15:46:21,SageSaga,"the guy was like ""That seems very possible, what brand is it? Yeah- thats a good modem- im going to just label it as approved in the system- have a good day"""
07-09-2018T15:46:53,phil199,.... at least the support guy was nice
07-09-2018T15:46:55,Bgrmystr2,"and just like that, it worked again? :P"
07-09-2018T15:47:02,SageSaga,yep - worked great
07-09-2018T15:47:11,Bgrmystr2,"see, they were trying to rip you off"
07-09-2018T15:47:17,phil199,^
07-09-2018T15:47:39,Nekonny,"That makes it sound like they were just filtering out out of spec equipment, and they were youing the explanation as an easy excuse"
07-09-2018T15:47:47,SageSaga,"hes probably informed that ""If people know what they are talking about- it means they might be able to actually win a law suit so just fix it for them- let the dumb ones pay for a new modem"""
07-09-2018T15:48:08,phil199,I´m baffled that is allowed
07-09-2018T15:48:29,Bgrmystr2,a lot of the bullshit ISPs do is not allowed
07-09-2018T15:48:33,Bgrmystr2,but they do it anyway
07-09-2018T15:48:36,Bgrmystr2,cuz noone's stopping them.
07-09-2018T15:48:46,Bgrmystr2,and noone's smart enough to realize it's not allowed to begin with
07-09-2018T15:48:49,SageSaga,"like when i was having network issues and gave them the IP address of their malfunctioning node and the guy was like ""uhhhhh- ok- i dont know what that is - im going to send you up a tier"""
07-09-2018T15:48:51,Nekonny,or people just don't care enough
07-09-2018T15:49:09,Bgrmystr2,"Oh I think people care, they just don't know"
07-09-2018T15:49:16,Nekonny,not at what they are getting paid
07-09-2018T15:49:45,phil199,"they´re trying to force the nationwide provider to install better net and internet speed here: problem is, that the government is slowing the process down as the company is 50% owned by it"
07-09-2018T15:50:01,SageSaga,"and then i talked to a guy who was like ""How did you know this?"" and i was like ""I just did a trace route"" and he was like ""Ah- cool, you're one of those. Thanks for letting us know- yeah it looks like that node is having a lot of issues-"""

07-09-2018T20:54:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve pulled a whole tack out of my foot before
07-09-2018T20:54:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Alcohol
07-09-2018T20:54:57,Bgrmystr2,well yeah that's rubbing alchohol.
07-09-2018T20:54:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Rubbed the whole half of foot
07-09-2018T20:55:02,Ordithus,"I got soooo lucky a few years back.  Accidentally broke a window in my apartment.  Hand, through the glass.  No cuts."
07-09-2018T20:55:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Accidentally shaved a part of my fingernail off with a razor
07-09-2018T20:55:46,SpazztasticKiwi,That was fun
07-09-2018T20:56:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Much blood. Long healing
07-09-2018T20:58:35,Ordithus,I have yet to cut myself with a knife.  Somehow.
07-09-2018T20:58:47,Ordithus,Little razor nicks don't count
07-09-2018T20:59:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m stupidly accident prone. Cut myself quite a few times
07-09-2018T21:01:36,Ordithus,Rolled a car once.  Virtually unscathed
07-09-2018T21:02:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Ran into a ditch and took out three saplings. Just fine
07-09-2018T21:03:00,SpazztasticKiwi,RIP side mirror tho
07-09-2018T21:03:18,Ordithus,RIP car in my case
07-09-2018T21:03:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m surprised I’m alive sometimes
07-09-2018T21:07:39,SpazztasticKiwi,My arms have a bit of a stripe pattern from oil burns
07-09-2018T21:09:30,Ordithus,"McD's, or something else?"
07-09-2018T21:10:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I worked there but only dealt with pulling out fries once or twice. They had my at backdrive
07-09-2018T21:10:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I work the fryer at Walmart in the deli
07-09-2018T21:11:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"If someone is at the fryer pulling something out, don’t bug em"
07-09-2018T21:12:45,SpazztasticKiwi,These are from the baskets rolling to the side when you flip the food out and they touch your arm
07-09-2018T21:15:32,Ordithus,Ow
07-09-2018T21:15:36,Ordithus,Mega ow
07-09-2018T21:16:14,Ordithus,I worked the fry station at McD's a lot
07-09-2018T21:16:19,Ordithus,No severe burns
07-09-2018T21:16:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Almost got a bath in hot oil the other week
07-09-2018T21:16:51,Ordithus,:ptv-nope: whyyy
07-09-2018T21:17:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"Fryer hose used to flush the vats at night slipped out, still pouring oil"
07-09-2018T21:17:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I hit hard reverse and let it cover the floor
07-09-2018T21:18:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Then shut off the pump
07-09-2018T21:18:39,Ordithus,Good idea
07-09-2018T21:19:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not getting third degree burns on my left side from the waist down
07-09-2018T21:21:11,SpazztasticKiwi,And we have a drain for oil and water overflows in the middle of the floor anyway
07-09-2018T21:23:55,Ordithus,Be safe :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
07-09-2018T21:25:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera mew so I mew back and he gives me the most insulted look
07-09-2018T21:28:45,Ordithus,"""I is the kitty, u hooman!"" :ctwokinds-flomad:"
07-09-2018T21:30:04,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
07-09-2018T21:31:16,SpazztasticKiwi,More like “how dare you talk back to me”
07-09-2018T21:32:54,SpazztasticKiwi,And it’s funny when I have the kitten cause he sits with his face away from me and grumbles to himself only to glance occasionally so he can grumble more
07-09-2018T21:33:42,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s so jealous and salty it’s ridiculous
07-09-2018T23:36:42,Dadrobit,Blargleargh
07-09-2018T23:37:07,Dadrobit,"Finally home, spent the whole day with grandaddy getting his new old truck."
07-09-2018T23:37:19,Dadrobit,"Was a good time, but feels nice to be home."
07-09-2018T23:37:37,Dadrobit,New Old Truck: https://i.imgur.com/hVUPJ3n.jpg
07-09-2018T23:37:45,Dadrobit,1946
07-09-2018T23:37:48,Dadrobit,Chevy
07-09-2018T23:37:58,Bgrmystr2,was just about to ask what happen now
07-09-2018T23:38:00,Bgrmystr2,but now I know
07-09-2018T23:38:33,Bgrmystr2,the guy here likes old trucks too
07-09-2018T23:38:40,Bgrmystr2,"cars, trucks, old stuff"
07-09-2018T23:38:49,Bgrmystr2,"rat rods, street rods, all that kinda shit"
07-09-2018T23:38:58,Bgrmystr2,so I've seen a lot of that
07-09-2018T23:40:10,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl: cool truck
07-09-2018T23:40:50,Bgrmystr2,"Not my style, but I can see the appeal. Does look cool"
07-09-2018T23:46:56,SpazztasticKiwi,We have a car show every Mule Day that shows cars like that
07-09-2018T23:47:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Old as dirt but still running
07-09-2018T23:48:05,Bgrmystr2,yeah all mechanical cars are much easier to maintain than cars with electronics.
07-09-2018T23:48:38,Dadrobit,"It was totally rebuilt from the bottom up a few years ago, but the old owner passed away soon after the rebuild, so it has next to no miles on it yet."
07-09-2018T23:49:41,Dadrobit,"The owner's son gave us this giant picture book full of the pictures that were taken chronicling the rebuild, was very cool to see what the truck went through."
07-09-2018T23:49:47,Bgrmystr2,"You never know if anything you have in your car will go out.. and if it does, is the part still made? technology stops building old stuff, but old cars are all big chunks of metal and stuff for the most part.. you can piece em together from the junkyard l"
07-09-2018T23:50:17,Bgrmystr2,not quite so easy for cars with electronics in em
07-09-2018T23:50:44,Dadrobit,"Only problem was when we were nearly home, the radiator cap started pissing coolant, not ideal lol."
07-09-2018T23:51:35,Dadrobit,"The cork seal in the cap had gone to shit, so an easy enough fix."
07-09-2018T23:51:36,Ordithus,Nice thing about the new cars is they often tell you what is wrong
07-09-2018T23:54:41,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
07-09-2018T23:56:45,Bgrmystr2,well yeah they'd have to
07-09-2018T23:56:55,Bgrmystr2,cuz there's so much you'd have to learn to figure it out yourself
