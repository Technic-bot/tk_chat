08-03-2018T21:02:28,ZephyrTWolffox,Hi Combak
08-03-2018T21:02:29,BluePhantom90,Because more people get sick during the winter because germs and other stuff will either adapt and get stronger to get people sick. If you do air out the place you get rid of the germs
08-03-2018T21:02:52,Bgrmystr2,you're just picking straws
08-03-2018T21:02:58,Bgrmystr2,that's one thing of many
08-03-2018T21:03:11,ZephyrTWolffox,What do you mean by 'air out'?
08-03-2018T21:03:41,Bgrmystr2,he means getting rid of stale air in your home

08-03-2018T22:25:14,Combak,"It'd be easier to say, why can you get the area under the graph of y=1/x for x&gt;0, but not calculate the length of the line."
08-03-2018T22:25:46,Vatruvius,Some poor sap is going to watch the youtube video of this and just see calculus equationgs.
08-03-2018T22:25:47,NezumiYuki,LOL that was intentional guys!  XD
08-03-2018T22:26:01,Twokinds,It only opens a doorway as big as the gate is
08-03-2018T22:26:03,Vatruvius,You are right KopyKat but it is a laptop keyboard.
08-03-2018T22:26:12,Combak,"So, Reni is flying home?"
08-03-2018T22:26:16,MuonNeutrino,"ah, so it's set by the destination, not the key"
08-03-2018T22:26:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,poor reni
08-03-2018T22:26:27,ClockworkTDC,^
08-03-2018T22:26:30,UnknownEnd,Yep
08-03-2018T22:26:35,NeonMitsumi,"At least she doesn't have to carry anyone, right?"
08-03-2018T22:26:40,Twokinds,"Well, yeah"
08-03-2018T22:26:40,ClockworkTDC,True
08-03-2018T22:26:45,Char89TheCharizard,Doesn't take REni that long to get there
08-03-2018T22:26:51,Twokinds,It goes to a prebuilt archway
08-03-2018T22:26:51,Vatruvius,I have to send it in during my spring break which is in two weeks so on my break I do not have my gaming pc!
08-03-2018T22:26:52,Combak,Unless Karen asks REALLY nicely. :p
08-03-2018T22:26:57,UnknownEnd,Yeah
08-03-2018T22:26:58,ClockworkTDC,lol
08-03-2018T22:27:03,MuonNeutrino,"eh, reni's actually probably small enough to squeeze through there if she folds her wings, she's a pretty small dragon"
08-03-2018T22:27:05,Bgrmystr2,lol in b4 Karin wants to ride the dragon back
08-03-2018T22:27:18,NezumiYuki,"Too bad Reni can't shape shift as well as Lady Nora... She could probably have changed into a kitty, like Nora did at one time, and just follow the crew through the doorway."
08-03-2018T22:27:56,MuonNeutrino,"@NezumiYuki in the previous comment reni did say 'we do have innate abilities, like our shapw-shifting'"
08-03-2018T22:28:09,SageSaga,uh oh
08-03-2018T22:28:11,MuonNeutrino,"that sounds to me like she *can* shapeshift, even if we haven't seen her do that yet"
08-03-2018T22:28:12,unsteddyphoenix,"Reni couldnt use it to get there anyway, right?"
08-03-2018T22:28:17,unsteddyphoenix,It'd dtake it to her home
08-03-2018T22:28:23,ZRO4825,Uh oh?
08-03-2018T22:28:26,unsteddyphoenix,*her
08-03-2018T22:28:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,what did you do sage?
08-03-2018T22:28:29,MuonNeutrino,"eh, don't think so @unsteddyphoenix"
08-03-2018T22:28:32,SageSaga,the to do list is already done
08-03-2018T22:28:37,ZRO4825,I think he's out of work already :joy:
08-03-2018T22:28:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,0_0
08-03-2018T22:28:44,unsteddyphoenix,DISASTER D:
08-03-2018T22:28:44,ClockworkTDC,on noes
08-03-2018T22:28:54,MuonNeutrino,"it sounded to me it was more like 'the person who uses it sets the destination', but now that trace has opened it i imagine anyone can go through"
08-03-2018T22:28:55,ClockworkTDC,*oh
08-03-2018T22:28:59,Ordithus,Bonjour!
08-03-2018T22:29:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,could this be the night Ron last longer then Sage?
08-03-2018T22:29:03,ZephyrTWolffox,B)
08-03-2018T22:29:05,ZRO4825,That means there's time for MORE TOYOKO! \[T]/
08-03-2018T22:29:08,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah
08-03-2018T22:29:12,SageSaga,i still have AI to work on
08-03-2018T22:29:17,MuonNeutrino,"if reni could fit, of course"
08-03-2018T22:29:34,unsteddyphoenix,"But it seemed if Reni used it, she could not get to Traces home even if she wanted to."
08-03-2018T22:29:40,MuonNeutrino,"probably, yeah"
08-03-2018T22:29:45,Nekonny,So Ruby finally gets a job working at paprika
08-03-2018T22:29:58,Nekonny,I had hped to get to this point earlier
08-03-2018T22:30:02,Bgrmystr2,Would reni really not fit? What if she just turned sideways?
08-03-2018T22:30:10,MuonNeutrino,it'd be kinda a security flaw if just anyone could open the gate to your house without you doing anything
08-03-2018T22:30:11,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, being a 2d comic and all..."
08-03-2018T22:30:16,MuonNeutrino,har har =P
08-03-2018T22:30:16,unsteddyphoenix,Tbh why isnt Traces gate dragon sized anyway
08-03-2018T22:30:23,SageSaga,this means if everyone gets their request in for the rest of the month I will only have 1 sketch and 1 color image per Friday night till the end of the month
08-03-2018T22:30:24,unsteddyphoenix,Isnt he a HIP NOBLE
08-03-2018T22:30:27,Twokinds,No you'd have to perform the ritual at the archway first to assign those authorized
08-03-2018T22:30:28,MuonNeutrino,"i think she'd fit anyway tbh, she's a pretty small dragon"
08-03-2018T22:30:29,Rosscoe,Does Ruby Tina look like a rookie too?
08-03-2018T22:30:37,Char89TheCharizard,"Spoiler alert, Flora is confirmed for Smash Bros. XD"
08-03-2018T22:30:49,Twokinds,"To open it. Obviously, anyone can just step through once it's open now."
08-03-2018T22:30:49,unsteddyphoenix,"Ahh, so she COULD port there if she had authority, gotcha"
08-03-2018T22:30:52,ItsActuallyKopyKat,If only...
08-03-2018T22:30:53,NezumiYuki,The crew could always just get behind Reni and shove her through?  xDD
08-03-2018T22:31:02,Nekonny,Pretty much. Ruby is the newcomer XD
08-03-2018T22:31:04,ClockworkTDC,lol
08-03-2018T22:31:06,NezumiYuki,Oh okay Tom
08-03-2018T22:31:12,NeonMitsumi,And turn her into chicken. lol
08-03-2018T22:31:13,Char89TheCharizard,I'm hyped for the new Smash Bros. game
08-03-2018T22:31:17,SageSaga,Ruby is a figment of their imaginations
08-03-2018T22:31:23,Nekonny,is she?
08-03-2018T22:31:33,SageSaga,yep - you told me that
08-03-2018T22:31:39,unsteddyphoenix,Ahahaha
08-03-2018T22:31:41,Nekonny,I did?
08-03-2018T22:31:46,SageSaga,yeah years ago
08-03-2018T22:31:47,unsteddyphoenix,Ron doesnt know lmao
08-03-2018T22:31:59,Ordithus,Ruby is also a figment of your imagination
08-03-2018T22:32:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,does ruby is real?
08-03-2018T22:32:10,unsteddyphoenix,Pls answer
08-03-2018T22:32:12,Ordithus,"She's not actually in the comic, Ron."
08-03-2018T22:32:15,Bgrmystr2,"I does is need to know, Marv"
08-03-2018T22:32:22,Nekonny,"Well, shes not anymore :P"
08-03-2018T22:32:23,Bgrmystr2,:v
08-03-2018T22:32:32,Vatruvius,Nothing is real! Think on that...brain fried.
08-03-2018T22:32:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,everything is permitted
08-03-2018T22:32:50,NezumiYuki,The Matrix is real?
08-03-2018T22:33:08,Vatruvius,We are all part of a simulation for a super advanced alien race.
08-03-2018T22:33:12,ClockworkTDC,^^
08-03-2018T22:33:20,Nekonny,Who knew?
08-03-2018T22:33:20,unsteddyphoenix,Thats ridiculous
08-03-2018T22:33:25,unsteddyphoenix,It's just super advanced humans
08-03-2018T22:33:27,unsteddyphoenix,Not aliens
08-03-2018T22:33:30,unsteddyphoenix,Thatd be crazy
08-03-2018T22:33:34,NezumiYuki,Screw the Engineers I say....
08-03-2018T22:33:55,Vatruvius,Let me get this straight unsteddyphoeni.
08-03-2018T22:34:06,unsteddyphoenix,plural?

08-03-2018T22:34:17,NeonMitsumi,Getting Phoenix straight? Pfffffffffffffffft
08-03-2018T22:34:19,NezumiYuki,But...

08-03-2018T22:34:36,NezumiYuki,No no
08-03-2018T22:34:40,NezumiYuki,It's a spork
08-03-2018T22:34:44,ClockworkTDC,It's a spork
08-03-2018T22:34:46,Vatruvius,Our future generations acseding into a higher dimension and came back to this momement in time now that time is no longer the same for them and copied us and simulated us to speed up the process and see what happened?
08-03-2018T22:34:48,NezumiYuki,See!
08-03-2018T22:34:52,NezumiYuki,It's a spork!

08-03-2018T22:35:12,Bgrmystr2,&gt;:C
08-03-2018T22:35:18,ClockworkTDC,lol
08-03-2018T22:35:19,unsteddyphoenix,What better way to learn about the past than replicate our exact starting conditions and watch it happen?
08-03-2018T22:35:23,Combak,Bye Zahn!
08-03-2018T22:35:25,NezumiYuki,Down with the Fpoons!!!!
08-03-2018T22:35:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,see ya Zahn
08-03-2018T22:35:37,Bgrmystr2,"You can't down what isn't fighting you, Nezumi"
08-03-2018T22:35:37,NezumiYuki,Sporks shall rein supreme!
08-03-2018T22:35:40,Sammit,Bye Zahn
08-03-2018T22:36:01,Vatruvius,"I don't know, cause my great great great grandchildren will learn I watch furry streams?"
08-03-2018T22:36:25,Ordithus,"Sweet, more of Trace's gardens.  They are so pretty."
08-03-2018T22:36:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Furry is the new ghetto white
08-03-2018T22:36:28,NezumiYuki,"Why would anyone want to be a ""Furless""?"
08-03-2018T22:36:32,ClockworkTDC,The dark side *picture of a fpoon* and the light *picture of a spork*
08-03-2018T22:36:39,unsteddyphoenix,"Well in the future there'll be space-furries so, you're a pioneer!"
08-03-2018T22:36:50,Vatruvius,Woo-Hoo1
08-03-2018T22:36:53,Vatruvius,!
08-03-2018T22:36:57,HeresyArtStream,I just ordered a bunch of dumb crap on eBay today because site-wide sale. :p
08-03-2018T22:37:01,NeonMitsumi,Degeneracy is spreading to space!
08-03-2018T22:37:07,Nekonny,"yes, saving is important"
08-03-2018T22:37:15,Combak,Sounds like a waste of money Heresy.
08-03-2018T22:37:15,Nekonny,sale on what?
08-03-2018T22:37:16,NezumiYuki,Scavens shall rule!  Hail the Under Kingdom!
08-03-2018T22:37:16,ZephyrTWolffox,And Furry smut!
08-03-2018T22:37:22,HeresyArtStream,"EVERYTHING, Neko."
08-03-2018T22:37:30,Nekonny,what you get?
08-03-2018T22:37:35,HeresyArtStream,A bunch of old games.
08-03-2018T22:37:35,NeonMitsumi,Wut
08-03-2018T22:37:40,ClockworkTDC,Wat
08-03-2018T22:37:43,Nekonny,h that
08-03-2018T22:37:48,NezumiYuki,Watsup?
08-03-2018T22:37:48,Combak,Sounds like it's time to mark up your prices then.
08-03-2018T22:37:56,Nekonny,I have to dust off some of my old titles XD
08-03-2018T22:38:01,HeresyArtStream,"I got Rocket Knight for Genesis, Sin & Punishment for N64, Mario Kart 64, Sonic CD, and a few other things."
08-03-2018T22:38:08,NezumiYuki,Speaking of Watsup... Where da Watwat at?
08-03-2018T22:38:12,Nekonny,"Oh, a collector? nice!"
08-03-2018T22:38:15,HeresyArtStream,"Days from now stuff will be on my doorstep and I'll be like ""wait, I ordered that?"" :V"
08-03-2018T22:38:21,HeresyArtStream,"Yes, I have quite a colleciton."
08-03-2018T22:38:26,HeresyArtStream,collection*
08-03-2018T22:38:39,Bgrmystr2,"He doesn't always come here, Nezumi"
08-03-2018T22:38:46,Nekonny,all of my stuff is nintendo
08-03-2018T22:38:54,Vatruvius,Hmm...who says we should raid Trace's home...cough...estate and claim it as our own?
08-03-2018T22:38:55,Nekonny,although I'm a few systems behind
08-03-2018T22:38:57,HeresyArtStream,I collect it all. But I have a lot of Nintendo stuff.
08-03-2018T22:39:11,Nekonny,I just didnt have the space/time
08-03-2018T22:39:12,unsteddyphoenix,If you wanna be a chicken more power to you dude
08-03-2018T22:39:16,HeresyArtStream,I didn't get a Wii or Wii U but I am gonna get a switch when my tax return comes in.
08-03-2018T22:39:21,SemiDemiGod,You dont need every system
08-03-2018T22:39:24,HeresyArtStream,^
08-03-2018T22:39:28,HeresyArtStream,Just most of them. :V
08-03-2018T22:39:29,Nekonny,you get to a point where you just don't play as much anymore
08-03-2018T22:39:32,Tharkis,"same reason i dont own a PS4 still, so little game time"
08-03-2018T22:39:37,Tharkis,that i just couldnt justify it
08-03-2018T22:39:48,Ordithus,Just a PS2 collection could fill a library
08-03-2018T22:39:53,Mihari,I haven't reached that point
08-03-2018T22:39:54,Tharkis,"heck, i hardly played any ps3 games, but i owned it because it was the first real BD3D player on the market"
08-03-2018T22:39:55,ZephyrTWolffox,I haven't had a console at all in about five years
08-03-2018T22:40:04,HeresyArtStream,New games don't excite me as much anymore. Most of my gaming money goes towards old games.
08-03-2018T22:40:20,ZRO4825,I just usually get to the point where I default back to MMOs &lt;_&lt;;
08-03-2018T22:40:23,Nekonny,"Well, comes with a full time job I guess"
08-03-2018T22:40:36,SageSaga,i have a problem with MHW
08-03-2018T22:40:38,Mihari,I think my job is 10x more demanding than yours.
08-03-2018T22:40:39,Vatruvius,I would disagree with you Heresy but I just bought like 12 old games on Steam :D
08-03-2018T22:40:44,Nekonny,"what little time I have left is house maintence, sleeping and drawing"
08-03-2018T22:40:57,ZRO4825,"What's up, Sage? D:"
08-03-2018T22:41:05,ClockworkTDC,"Marv help me, I believe there is a government spy standing at my front door wanting to get in"
08-03-2018T22:41:13,SageSaga,i have over 200 hours in the game- i think that constitutes a problem
08-03-2018T22:41:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,he can't stop playing MHW
08-03-2018T22:41:20,ZephyrTWolffox,"That's the dog, Clock"
08-03-2018T22:41:20,ZRO4825,"You too, eh?"
08-03-2018T22:41:22,HeresyArtStream,I am looking forward to Vermintide 2.
08-03-2018T22:41:25,Vatruvius,If he calls you Mr. Anderson run.
08-03-2018T22:41:27,SageSaga,and even with all that- i cant wait to get it for PC
08-03-2018T22:41:31,ZRO4825,XD
08-03-2018T22:41:33,Bgrmystr2,only 200 hours?
08-03-2018T22:41:34,SageSaga,and do it all over again
08-03-2018T22:41:37,unsteddyphoenix,Vermintide 2 is pretty sweet
08-03-2018T22:41:38,Bgrmystr2,those are rookie numbers
08-03-2018T22:41:41,ClockworkTDC,'
08-03-2018T22:41:41,Nekonny,"Demanding or not, it still keeps me away from home for 10 hours"
08-03-2018T22:41:44,SageSaga,i said over 200
08-03-2018T22:41:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I too am waiting for the pc release
08-03-2018T22:41:48,Nekonny,not very flexible
08-03-2018T22:41:54,unsteddyphoenix,Over 200 = 500
08-03-2018T22:42:05,Bgrmystr2,"but if it wasn't close to 200, then you would have used a different number"
08-03-2018T22:42:06,HeresyArtStream,I heard good things about MHW. My problem though is that I already have too many new games to catch up on.
08-03-2018T22:42:09,ClockworkTDC,Are you sure Zephyr?
08-03-2018T22:42:12,HeresyArtStream,I buy them on sale and then forget to play them.
08-03-2018T22:42:15,Rosscoe,Nekonny is a arting Comic machine!
08-03-2018T22:42:16,FenceEqualizer,On the bright side you got quite an it if time to prepare for the pc release
08-03-2018T22:42:26,unsteddyphoenix,Unless he was embarrassed about the 500hr hes spent bgr
08-03-2018T22:42:28,Vatruvius,"Wait...I have over 200 hours in life, so does that mean I only have 500 hours in life?"

08-03-2018T22:42:52,HeresyArtStream,I had to kind of put a self-imposed freeze on buying Steam games just because they're on sale.
08-03-2018T22:42:55,Bgrmystr2,"lol phoenix, lack of confidence ;u"
08-03-2018T22:42:59,Nekonny,"I don't spend as much on comics as I used to, but I get a lo t of other things done"

08-03-2018T22:43:48,ClockworkTDC,ok  fine
08-03-2018T22:43:53,Mihari,Not touching that one.
08-03-2018T22:44:07,Vatruvius,"I hear you, my stopping point tends to be lack of money but I was able to control myself this time. Woohoo, $60!"
08-03-2018T22:44:09,Nekonny,no need
08-03-2018T22:45:22,Rosscoe,parents internet is so bad tonight

08-03-2018T22:45:38,Vatruvius,What is your download speed?
08-03-2018T22:46:00,Nekonny,too bad picarto doesnt have a low bandwith option
08-03-2018T22:46:05,Rosscoe,Where Im renting at in Nova Scotia is 115MBs a second or faster
08-03-2018T22:46:15,Vatruvius,I bet you bragging rights mine is worse.
08-03-2018T22:46:21,ZephyrTWolffox,Ya I'm at about 2 or 3 mps
08-03-2018T22:46:25,Vatruvius,Hahaha...Mine is worse.
08-03-2018T22:46:33,Vatruvius,5MBps
08-03-2018T22:46:34,Rosscoe,On the farm it be lucky to even get 2MBs out of the 50 they are paying for
08-03-2018T22:46:35,Nekonny,Ah I see
08-03-2018T22:46:57,Nekonny,"Refresh my memory, was I working on animation last week?"
08-03-2018T22:47:01,Nekonny,or was it a comic
08-03-2018T22:47:12,Nekonny,last friday I mean
08-03-2018T22:47:13,Ordithus,I recall animation things.
08-03-2018T22:47:33,ZephyrTWolffox,Ok i gotta hit the hay.  Goodnight folks.
08-03-2018T22:47:37,Ordithus,I was freaking out about the doll-like expressions :ptv-confused:
08-03-2018T22:48:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Zep

08-03-2018T22:48:58,Vatruvius,Umm...what just happened?
08-03-2018T22:49:04,Sammit,Bye Zephyr
08-03-2018T22:49:07,Nekonny,"If you want to hear, turn on audio in my stream for a bit"
08-03-2018T22:49:12,Vatruvius,My family got home and my sister came at me with a knife? Help?
08-03-2018T22:49:30,ZRO4825,Be glad it wasn't a sword. They're harder to get away from.
08-03-2018T22:49:34,CrRAR,I suggest you stop chatting and start acting.
08-03-2018T22:49:48,Vatruvius,Quick...magic...go!
08-03-2018T22:49:54,Vatruvius,blrg*

08-03-2018T22:50:08,Vatruvius,x_x
08-03-2018T22:50:28,HeresyArtStream,I was going to buy a vintage Sony Walkman while I was eBay binging but decided I'd better not blow another $100 right now.
08-03-2018T22:50:43,thestooge,I think I know that VA
08-03-2018T22:50:45,ZRO4825,Walkmans weren't even worth that much new anyway. :v
08-03-2018T22:50:54,Nekonny,I did 3 tests using audio from a few voice actors that submitted auditions
08-03-2018T22:51:00,BluePhantom90,lol
08-03-2018T22:51:05,Nekonny,still trying to decide on who to go with
08-03-2018T22:51:14,HeresyArtStream,I was also tempted to buy a PC Engine Duo. I decided I should probably research what games I'd actually want to play on it besides Castlevania before I dump that kind of money into another retro system.
08-03-2018T22:51:15,BluePhantom90,Come on Heresy you need to control that spending
08-03-2018T22:51:28,HeresyArtStream,lol I know
08-03-2018T22:51:39,Vatruvius,They are worth that much now because of...I am drawing a blank...Guardians of the Galaxy.
08-03-2018T22:51:47,HeresyArtStream,"I did get more money from my insurance adjustment than I was expecting though, so that's part of the problem. :V"
08-03-2018T22:51:48,Nekonny,You do stooge?
08-03-2018T22:52:34,HeresyArtStream,The insurance company threw in an extra grand for auto rentals because of how long I had to go without the vehicle (even though I wasn't driving it anyway) so I had a bit of a hole burning in my pocket.

08-03-2018T22:56:51,NeonMitsumi,I'll just pretend like I know who Toyoko is.
08-03-2018T22:56:52,ZRO4825,I occasionally switch it up and get a Michelle image to appease the cheetah goddess &lt;3
08-03-2018T22:56:52,Mihari,Atleast when it comes to the comic.
08-03-2018T22:56:59,aeoronwah,Needs even more toyoko then
08-03-2018T22:57:12,unsteddyphoenix,Just go with the flow Neon~
08-03-2018T22:57:22,NeonMitsumi,...sure?
08-03-2018T22:57:24,SageSaga,you could ask for pictures of Mihari too

08-03-2018T22:58:47,Rosscoe,Has R34 Mihari been done yet? Be interesting to see how much different a man version would look :thinking:
08-03-2018T22:58:56,Sammit,Hi W0lf and Glavous
08-03-2018T22:58:58,unsteddyphoenix,You mean 63
08-03-2018T22:59:08,Rosscoe,Hello Wolfy!
08-03-2018T22:59:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Mihari with a R34, yes please"
08-03-2018T22:59:26,Rosscoe,"But yea, all thse numbers, might as well just say Gender Swap"
08-03-2018T22:59:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,was talking about the car
08-03-2018T22:59:46,unsteddyphoenix,Thats so many letters though~
08-03-2018T22:59:48,Nekonny,&gt;.&gt;
08-03-2018T22:59:51,Bgrmystr2,"Ross, you mean 63, not 64"
08-03-2018T22:59:52,Mihari,I never understood why people enjoy gender swaps.
08-03-2018T22:59:56,Bgrmystr2,"er, 34*"
08-03-2018T23:00:10,ZRO4825,"R34 iirc is the ""If it exists, there is porn of it"""
08-03-2018T23:00:10,Vatruvius,Because female Mike is funny.
08-03-2018T23:00:10,Bgrmystr2,probably because it deals with the unknown
08-03-2018T23:00:19,Bgrmystr2,yeah zro
08-03-2018T23:00:20,Ordithus,"Blame Tom.  He did it once, now it'll never stop."
08-03-2018T23:00:24,unsteddyphoenix,I get it to a point
08-03-2018T23:00:32,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah Toms a big instigator lol
08-03-2018T23:00:59,ZRO4825,"As for gender swaps. IDK exactly to be honest, but I'd say because it falls under the fantasy/""Can't have it IRL"" deal. Kinda like elves, and catgirls, and anthros, lol."
08-03-2018T23:01:05,Ordithus,Though it's usually boys becoming girls :ptv-wondering:
08-03-2018T23:01:16,Mihari,You can have it in RL
08-03-2018T23:01:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Zen with boobs is the breast
08-03-2018T23:01:23,Mihari,And most people don't like it either XD
08-03-2018T23:01:24,ZRO4825,"Well, yeah, like we need any more silly men running around."
08-03-2018T23:01:26,Bgrmystr2,marv pls xD
08-03-2018T23:01:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:)
08-03-2018T23:01:58,Vatruvius,Just quietly eating chocolate watching all this unfold.
08-03-2018T23:02:09,ZRO4825,"That's the fantasy aspect Mihari. In fantasy-land, it's instant, complete, and magic makes sure it works properly. Human doctors are silly people who haven't figured out quite how to properly play god yet. :P"
08-03-2018T23:02:25,Bgrmystr2,"genderswap is literally just the mystery of the unknown, experiencing something you may never truly understand"

08-03-2018T23:03:53,Mihari,"Okay I can get some people wanting certain things swapped, but why Mihari, I mean you don't get more vanilla cheetah than that, just find another male cheetah character. *shrugs*"
08-03-2018T23:03:55,Glavous,Hello
08-03-2018T23:04:18,ZoieFalcona,"Sorry, no swappy the Mihari. I like her as is!"
08-03-2018T23:04:19,Sammit,Hi Zoie
08-03-2018T23:04:24,Bgrmystr2,because the other male cheetah character won't be mihari
08-03-2018T23:04:25,unsteddyphoenix,"Untrue, a more vanilla cheetah would have no hair!"
08-03-2018T23:04:28,Bgrmystr2,it'll be someone else
08-03-2018T23:04:35,Bgrmystr2,and that's defeating the purpose
08-03-2018T23:04:37,Mihari,a male cheetah mihari wouldn't be mihari either
08-03-2018T23:04:42,ClockworkTDC,this music rn lol
08-03-2018T23:04:44,unsteddyphoenix,Male Mihari = Manhairy
08-03-2018T23:04:48,Bgrmystr2,"sure it would, tis why it's called genderswap"
08-03-2018T23:04:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
08-03-2018T23:05:08,Bgrmystr2,that's the whole point behind the genre in the first place
08-03-2018T23:05:18,Rosscoe,"Honstly I'd think it be neat while atthe same time being ""If one exsists it must have a opposite version"""

08-03-2018T23:06:01,Mihari,I can't see the appeal.
08-03-2018T23:06:02,Bgrmystr2,in the opposite end of the universe or somethin
08-03-2018T23:06:19,FoxxTrotter,Chazore is the only one I've seen intentionally done both ways with much significance.
08-03-2018T23:07:06,Bgrmystr2,"Foxx, you haven't bothered to look at Japan, have you? lol"
08-03-2018T23:07:26,Vatruvius,"With the multiverse theory, there is a female version or male version of you right now doing...things."
08-03-2018T23:07:27,ZRO4825,:thinking: Trying to think what a genderswap of my snep would be like. I don't think he'd be able to stand up straight without falling over backwards. :joy:
08-03-2018T23:07:30,unsteddyphoenix,Japan? Do they do unusual things or something?
08-03-2018T23:07:42,FoxxTrotter,Well...unless you're talking Pokemon. :0P

08-03-2018T23:13:21,Vatruvius,"Okay...Okay...But I am with unsteddy on this one. I would like a magic gateway, protective spells that turn intruders into chickens, and awesome artifacts."
08-03-2018T23:13:39,CrimsonHelsing,Ikr?
08-03-2018T23:13:47,Bgrmystr2,"Same Vatru, that'd be cool"
08-03-2018T23:13:51,ZRO4825,You forgot the awesome wolf servant lady~
08-03-2018T23:13:53,CrimsonHelsing,That's actually very neat Vatru
08-03-2018T23:13:58,unsteddyphoenix,Genocidal maniac Trace knew what was good
08-03-2018T23:14:05,Ordithus,I'm not sure how I'd feel about having eggs laid by a door-to-door knife salesman.
08-03-2018T23:14:07,ZRO4825,But did he know what was best in life?
08-03-2018T23:14:14,Vatruvius,"When do we get VR like in the upcoming move ""Ready Player One"" and just live in the world of TwoKinds?"
08-03-2018T23:14:20,CrimsonHelsing,Guess his paranoid delusions paid off
08-03-2018T23:14:21,Vatruvius,Who would pay for that?
08-03-2018T23:14:21,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, slaughtering innocents"
08-03-2018T23:14:24,Bgrmystr2,"It's probably unlikely that Trace's tastes changed, Phoenix"
08-03-2018T23:14:28,Vatruvius,It would require your soul.
08-03-2018T23:14:45,Bgrmystr2,He probably would still like the same stuff for the most part
08-03-2018T23:14:50,Bgrmystr2,it's just lack of memory
08-03-2018T23:14:55,unsteddyphoenix,I mean...
08-03-2018T23:14:55,Unenlagia,"Rose is very, very sneaky. Isn't she?"
08-03-2018T23:14:57,unsteddyphoenix,Keidran.
08-03-2018T23:15:04,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, and without that memory"
08-03-2018T23:15:08,Bgrmystr2,he wouldn't hate them
08-03-2018T23:15:13,Nekonny,anyone here own an original gameboy? ^^

08-03-2018T23:15:39,Bgrmystr2,:U
08-03-2018T23:15:39,CrimsonHelsing,"Wait... random thought, Trace has mana induced schitzophrenia behind the amnesia, yes? So... I can't help but wonder, what would be the mana version of antipsychotics o.o"
