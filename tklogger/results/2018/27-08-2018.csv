27-08-2018T03:52:07,Vatruvius,so I may have redo the process and clone over each partition separately in the order I would like or use a different 3rd party software solution. Waiting for some feedback on a tech forum I posted this particular issue to.

27-08-2018T03:59:47,unsteddyphoenix,ah unlucky

27-08-2018T19:08:20,Bgrmystr2,your best bet is to presume that there will not be one but hang out just in case.
27-08-2018T19:14:32,CommanderTrace,youre right
27-08-2018T19:20:13,Twokinds,I might stream

27-08-2018T19:27:53,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, true"
27-08-2018T19:28:42,unsteddyphoenix,Is the reason the colours for this month havent been uploaded yet 'cause you have excess art to upload?
27-08-2018T19:35:49,Twokinds,Well there was two extra sketches and five color pieaces
27-08-2018T19:35:55,Twokinds,So it works out perfectly
27-08-2018T19:37:54,unsteddyphoenix,Oh. Huh. I guess that's true.
27-08-2018T19:38:17,unsteddyphoenix,I am not the smartest :thinking:
27-08-2018T20:02:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I just saw a guy take a lot cigarette inside Walmart

27-08-2018T20:05:36,Bgrmystr2,so.. 1 half then? :v

27-08-2018T20:06:30,Bgrmystr2,that's what she wants.
27-08-2018T20:06:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Our slicers go at intervals of ones (1-24) as a guide to cut the meats
27-08-2018T20:06:38,Bgrmystr2,xD
27-08-2018T20:06:55,SpazztasticKiwi,What she was wanting was for it to bue cut at the interval ‚Äúbetween 1 and 2‚Äù
27-08-2018T20:07:09,ferociousfox,does it start at 0 tho
27-08-2018T20:07:16,SpazztasticKiwi,She apparently didn‚Äôt get that this interval is also known as ‚Äú1 1/2‚Äù
27-08-2018T20:07:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"Zero is the point where the blade is closed and hidden in its cover, so it doesn‚Äôt accidentally cut anyone"
27-08-2018T20:08:20,SpazztasticKiwi,The blade cover will not move if the interval guide is on anything but 0
27-08-2018T20:09:21,unsteddyphoenix,"I can only assume she thought you said ""one half coming up"""
27-08-2018T20:09:49,SpazztasticKiwi,She wanted a pound of it cut on the slice thickness of ‚Äúbetween 1 and 2‚Äù

27-08-2018T20:12:01,Bgrmystr2,I think the only thing clear is her dumb.
27-08-2018T20:12:07,Bgrmystr2,that may be me though
27-08-2018T20:12:20,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah nah im pretty sure we all understood
27-08-2018T20:12:37,unsteddyphoenix,What I DONT understand is how she got it wrong lol
27-08-2018T20:12:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Who knows
27-08-2018T20:12:59,ferociousfox,"clearly she wants a variety of thickness between 1 and 2, to give it that home cut feel"

27-08-2018T20:13:18,Bgrmystr2,clearly

27-08-2018T20:42:39,Dadrobit,The mirror being placed right in front there was awkward for a while.
27-08-2018T20:42:39,CommanderTrace,can people get in?
27-08-2018T20:42:54,CommanderTrace,in the elevator
27-08-2018T20:43:02,unsteddyphoenix,Dude toilets facing a giant mirror is the weirdest thing
27-08-2018T20:43:11,unsteddyphoenix,Its a thing and I dont know why

27-08-2018T20:43:18,Bgrmystr2,the door
27-08-2018T20:43:30,CommanderTrace,yeah but in this
27-08-2018T20:43:35,Dadrobit,"Not exactly true, Bgr. My next door neighbor's house was a house that was built around the trailer it started out as."
27-08-2018T20:44:12,Bgrmystr2,"then it's a house, isn't it?"
27-08-2018T20:44:15,Dadrobit,The trailer just functions as the kitchen and dinner nook area now.
27-08-2018T20:44:24,Bgrmystr2,it's no longer a trailer.
27-08-2018T20:44:44,Dadrobit,"I mean, if you put the wheels back on, it'd drive right out."
27-08-2018T20:45:02,Bgrmystr2,"then it'd become a trailer again, but till then, it's still house. :)"

27-08-2018T20:45:23,Dadrobit,Especially since I didn't own a phone back then.
27-08-2018T20:45:36,Mippy,Are we denying the houses trailer heritage?
27-08-2018T20:45:39,Dadrobit,Just had to deal with the company of myself.
27-08-2018T20:45:50,Bgrmystr2,"no mippy, cuz it only functions as what it is at the time"

27-08-2018T20:47:38,Bgrmystr2,"haha, I wouldn't use a phone as a paperweight, that's silly"
27-08-2018T20:47:41,Mippy,Dunno...never been in either
27-08-2018T20:48:07,Bgrmystr2,I'm just saying a trailer will never be a traditional brick & mortar home. They're fundamentally different
27-08-2018T20:48:30,Dadrobit,TFW the home that was built around it is literally brick and mortar.
27-08-2018T20:48:36,Mippy,"Unless you use America to mean the continent...then are you talking North, South, or Central?"
27-08-2018T20:48:55,Bgrmystr2,"but it's still just a trailer that's inside a house, yeah?"
27-08-2018T20:49:05,Bgrmystr2,it's not like you've changed it
27-08-2018T20:49:32,Dadrobit,There's permanant-ish hookups for water/septic.
27-08-2018T20:50:48,Bgrmystr2,"just cuz I eat a sandwich and it goes inside of me, that I am now the sandwich. xD"
27-08-2018T20:50:59,CommanderTrace,I've been to Florida 3 times the houses were different but we were in a resort I don't know if it differs from other normal  houses
27-08-2018T20:51:09,Bgrmystr2,"I am not a sandwich,"
27-08-2018T20:51:36,Bgrmystr2,"and last I checked, trailers don't break down into nutriants for houses to grow and live longer.."
27-08-2018T20:51:37,Bgrmystr2,so..
27-08-2018T20:51:47,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. that'd be cool tho

27-08-2018T21:31:55,Bgrmystr2,"srsly I can't even make it stay playing, it either loads every 10-30 seconds, or dies and doesn't play video ever."

27-08-2018T21:34:38,unsteddyphoenix,Huh. But it only affects some of us?
27-08-2018T21:34:53,Bgrmystr2,"well, it could be server-related"
27-08-2018T21:35:21,Issus,I'm sure they have multiple servers so probably depends on which one you're connected to.
27-08-2018T21:35:35,Bgrmystr2,"tis my thoughts, issus"
27-08-2018T21:35:42,Bgrmystr2,and we can't really control that
27-08-2018T21:35:43,Kynum,maybe it's connected to how much Strawberry you have in your cereal in the morning.
27-08-2018T21:35:44,TheSexyBeast,Picarto has been acting squirrelly for me for a couple of months
27-08-2018T21:35:59,Kynum,Would nibbs approve?

27-08-2018T22:29:10,thestooge,Giving non paetron supporters the chance to Nora card sketches they like
27-08-2018T22:29:15,Kynum,oh
27-08-2018T22:29:51,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I strongly considered voting for snep villiage
27-08-2018T22:30:01,unsteddyphoenix,But boobs OP
27-08-2018T22:30:03,Twokinds,"Uh, I don't remember proposing an idea like that."
27-08-2018T22:30:10,CrRAR,I srsly thought it would do well on its own unstedd
27-08-2018T22:30:20,unsteddyphoenix,I kinda felt that way too
27-08-2018T22:30:25,ferociousfox,I take these votes more seriously than my breakfast
27-08-2018T22:30:33,ferociousfox,tbh
27-08-2018T22:30:33,Kynum,whoa
27-08-2018T22:30:40,CrRAR,Yeah the patreon way allows for a quota (4 a month)
27-08-2018T22:30:42,Kynum,that's pretty serious
27-08-2018T22:30:49,Bgrmystr2,the patreon IS public though..
27-08-2018T22:30:51,ferociousfox,at least as serious as brows
27-08-2018T22:30:56,Kynum,^^
27-08-2018T22:31:01,Bgrmystr2,and that's how people buy the nora cards..
27-08-2018T22:31:06,Bgrmystr2,I dunno how much more public you get?
27-08-2018T22:31:15,CrRAR,lol
27-08-2018T22:31:16,thestooge,"Odd, I remember a few others mentioned you did. still it's not a bad idea."
27-08-2018T22:31:21,unsteddyphoenix,"I just vote based on my instincts, otherwise I think about it for aaages"
27-08-2018T22:31:37,CrRAR,yeah
27-08-2018T22:32:11,iliar,I think the main problem of this idea. Tom does not have time to do on time even make Patreon Nora Cards. I think change limit is not good idea.
27-08-2018T22:32:23,Twokinds,I do wish I did the Nora Cards differently.
27-08-2018T22:32:37,unsteddyphoenix,How so?
27-08-2018T22:32:41,Dadrobit,Back.
27-08-2018T22:32:42,thestooge,It's never too late to change it
27-08-2018T22:32:43,CrRAR,wb
27-08-2018T22:32:49,Dadrobit,Pro Tools was peeving me off.
27-08-2018T22:32:56,Twokinds,"If I were to do it over again, I would have all the slots closed at the end of the month and reopened on the 1st"
27-08-2018T22:32:59,unsteddyphoenix,timing impeccable as always
27-08-2018T22:33:01,Dadrobit,Friggin codecs not codec-ing
27-08-2018T22:33:20,Ordithus,Change who has it that way
27-08-2018T22:33:21,unsteddyphoenix,"So different people would get chances, you mean?"
27-08-2018T22:33:28,Dadrobit,Lol
27-08-2018T22:33:30,Twokinds,So that every 1st all four slots are open.
27-08-2018T22:33:41,CrRAR,"ahh, isee"
27-08-2018T22:33:43,Ordithus,"Granted, it'd be a rabid dash to get them still"
27-08-2018T22:33:49,Dadrobit,Instead of people not cancelling their subscription and auto-getting the slot?
27-08-2018T22:34:00,ferociousfox,but the price point keeps the supply there
27-08-2018T22:34:16,Twokinds,"Yeeah. Eh, probably would end up about the same."
27-08-2018T22:34:24,unsteddyphoenix,"Seems like you shouldve made them more expensive, really."
27-08-2018T22:34:34,CrRAR,^ this guy
27-08-2018T22:34:37,Twokinds,lol
27-08-2018T22:34:37,Dadrobit,"Not gonna lie, I'd place bets that it wouldn't change that much."
27-08-2018T22:34:39,Twokinds,No way
27-08-2018T22:34:42,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-adiracoin:
27-08-2018T22:34:47,Dadrobit,Why not?
27-08-2018T22:34:51,unsteddyphoenix,"I mean. Supply and demand, you know?"
27-08-2018T22:34:52,Twokinds,The price they already are is pressure enough
27-08-2018T22:35:12,unsteddyphoenix,Lol.
27-08-2018T22:35:13,ferociousfox,big shoutouts to all nora card holders

27-08-2018T22:37:32,thestooge,"If it were a raffle I'd say the price would have to be lower, 200 dollars is a bit much for just a chance at getting a card"

27-08-2018T22:40:41,thestooge,That is also true.
27-08-2018T22:40:53,Dadrobit,"I should charge more myself, get the spending cash for a card faster."
27-08-2018T22:41:29,Ordithus,If Picarto had some way of being able to queue support tiers...
