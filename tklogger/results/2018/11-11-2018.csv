11-11-2018T00:47:06,Dadrobit,"... I've never really thought about it, but I wonder how many pet hedgehogs have been adopted purely for the sake of naming them ""Sonic""?"
11-11-2018T00:53:28,SpazztasticKiwi,The same amount of dalmations that get called spot
11-11-2018T01:23:56,Twokinds,And the same amount of pet tigers that get called Flora.
11-11-2018T01:29:45,Dadrobit,"I mean, Spot was a thing way before media told us it was"

11-11-2018T10:24:08,Twokinds,I'll keep that in mind next time.
11-11-2018T10:25:16,iliar,I didn't expect that you will delete posts. I think it will not be very difficult to fix the program in order to avoid this in the future.
11-11-2018T10:27:15,iliar,But at first I need fix my hardware. Recently I had problems with electricity and now my router is glitching.
11-11-2018T10:27:47,Twokinds,I don't normally delete posts. I just figured the announcement for the stream wasn't needed anymore.

11-11-2018T13:43:56,Dadrobit,":/ Turns out Grandaddy might have a broken foot. He's getting it checked today, and he's still walking around on it, but it"
11-11-2018T13:44:11,Dadrobit,it's a rather bit too swollen for our liking.
11-11-2018T13:44:59,Twokinds,Man everyone's getting hurt D:
11-11-2018T13:45:02,Xexanoth,does it hurt or is it just swollen?
11-11-2018T13:45:04,Twokinds,Sorry to hear that.
11-11-2018T13:45:14,Twokinds,Be careful out there. No one else get hurt!
11-11-2018T13:45:29,Xexanoth,cause if it's jsut swollen there's a ton of stuff it can be with older people.
11-11-2018T13:46:45,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it's sore. He's pretty tough with pain though. Broke his other foot last year and laughed it off before he put a boot on it."
11-11-2018T13:47:56,Dadrobit,"Dunno if you were around when I was talking about it last night, Xex, but he took a fall stumbling in the dark over some steps and got kinda roughed up."
11-11-2018T13:48:26,Twokinds,Ouch
11-11-2018T13:48:36,Dadrobit,"Spent the morning at his house, and aside from talking politics, he was in good spirits."
11-11-2018T13:48:54,Twokinds,"I've never broken anything before, but I'm afraid I don't have much of a tollerance for pain."
11-11-2018T13:48:58,Twokinds,Glad he's taking it well.
11-11-2018T13:50:34,Xexanoth,"eh, breaking stuff mostly hurts in the beginning, but unless you put pressure on it, it's not really that painful"
11-11-2018T13:50:48,Boxthefox,breaking or snaping a bone its like the pain of not felling your bone. at least that is my experience from it
11-11-2018T13:52:01,Dadrobit,"Yeah, he's a swell guy overall. Can get kinda facetious and cantankerous over some things, but he likes laughing and being happy with folks. He's broken plenty of bones before, so it's whatever at this point. ""Eh, they'll give me a new boot and some meds"""
11-11-2018T13:53:37,Dadrobit,"Xex has it pretty right. It hurts for a bit, then it's just kinda not noticeable as long as you aren't distracted by it."
11-11-2018T13:53:53,Dadrobit,Source: I've broken a shitload of bones
11-11-2018T13:55:23,Dadrobit,Only time that wasn't the case was when I sheared off my ankle. That was rough. Took some surgery/hardware to put back together and would occasionally just flare up with pain for like 3-4 weeks.
11-11-2018T13:57:05,Dadrobit,I remember the X-Ray looked photoshopped because the break was so clean. Just a straight line. And my ankle was just hanging out in the arch of my foot completely separate.
11-11-2018T13:58:12,Dadrobit,"Before they showed me the x-ray, I was insistent that it wasn't broken. I had walked on it a bit and it just felt like I had twisted my ankle."
11-11-2018T13:58:16,Dadrobit,I was wrong lol.
11-11-2018T14:13:24,Twokinds,lol
11-11-2018T14:13:55,Twokinds,Yeah I remember when my brother broke his arm. Mother thought it was just sprained. It weren't.
11-11-2018T14:17:32,1Jedai,Hi Tom! I want to ask you about your future comic with Sam and Colin. When can we find out more details about him?
11-11-2018T14:18:26,Twokinds,Don't know yet.
11-11-2018T14:18:31,Twokinds,I imagine it won't be for a few years.
11-11-2018T14:21:38,1Jedai,This comic will be less than Twokinds?
11-11-2018T14:22:35,Twokinds,Less than Twokinds?
11-11-2018T14:23:39,Mippy,Got my hedgehog some antibiotics. Hope it helps.
11-11-2018T14:24:40,1Jedai,"Well, tk pretty big comic. And you worked on it for many years."

11-11-2018T14:41:41,Twokinds,I don't know
11-11-2018T14:44:33,1Jedai,"So, Tom thank you for answering. I hope I did not tire you with my questions)"
11-11-2018T14:51:31,Twokinds,No prob
11-11-2018T14:55:02,totallynotTrace,so your drawings of S&C so far have modern tech. Is this the same world as TK but future? yes its ok to be undecided or just dont want to tell. Surprises can be good

11-11-2018T18:17:03,CatzArt,i am well aware of that. I just wanted to say at least one thing in the chat since ive been silently hiding in the background for a while. Since im trapped here
11-11-2018T18:17:37,ThingsAreMoving,lurking is nothing to be ashamed of

11-11-2018T18:20:14,ThingsAreMoving,Maybe that cocoa powder has some powdered milk in it too
11-11-2018T18:20:23,HobbitGames,Ugh. Disgusting. Yoh cant just drink milk on its own.
11-11-2018T18:20:29,ThingsAreMoving,but still milk should make it more.... creamy

11-11-2018T18:21:12,Bgrmystr2,there's a lot of halfass quality cocoa that don't taste any different with milk or water
11-11-2018T18:21:17,HobbitGames,I am aware that it is possible to. I just think it tastes disgusting
11-11-2018T18:21:30,Bgrmystr2,well you're drinking the wrong brand
11-11-2018T18:21:38,CatzArt,and thats the cocoa this poor college student buys.
11-11-2018T18:21:42,Bgrmystr2,LOTS of brands suck.
11-11-2018T18:21:44,HobbitGames,All of the hot chocolate i ever get tastes like boiled water. Horrid
11-11-2018T18:21:47,ThingsAreMoving,"Well I'm using powdered cocoa beans, not the instant hot chocolate"
11-11-2018T18:22:05,ThingsAreMoving,so milk is the only way to go with it
11-11-2018T18:22:26,HobbitGames,"Well, not really. No milj tastes nice to me. Its allright with a bit of cereal, and the odd cup of tea."
11-11-2018T18:22:39,CatzArt,meh alot of non americans I know claim that american chocolate is sub par to european variants
11-11-2018T18:22:59,HobbitGames,Chocolate or hot chocolate drink?
11-11-2018T18:22:59,Bgrmystr2,"Hobbit, unless you've drank like 12+ brands of milk.."
11-11-2018T18:23:06,CatzArt,both
11-11-2018T18:23:06,Bgrmystr2,then I doubt it
11-11-2018T18:23:11,HobbitGames,Oh definitelt at least that
11-11-2018T18:23:25,HobbitGames,Chocolate bars are definitwly better here
11-11-2018T18:23:40,HobbitGames,A good Cadburya bar. Mmm
11-11-2018T18:23:49,HobbitGames,Cadbury's*
11-11-2018T18:24:04,HobbitGames,Dairy milk...... mmmm i meed one now
11-11-2018T18:24:13,ThingsAreMoving,I never had any american made chocolate afaik
11-11-2018T18:24:16,CatzArt,Yeah Europe has a more quality over quantity to it. but ill take my cheap ALDI hot choco any day
11-11-2018T18:24:20,ThingsAreMoving,So I can't really comment on that
11-11-2018T18:24:21,Bgrmystr2,I'm just not buying it. You can't drink milk in other things but think milk is nasty on it's own. That's not how tastebuds work lol
11-11-2018T18:24:48,Bgrmystr2,yeah europe prolly has good chocolate
11-11-2018T18:25:09,ThingsAreMoving,we have the swiss and belgium to thank for that tbh
11-11-2018T18:25:17,HobbitGames,"Yes it is? People have individual tastes and likes? So if I think milk doesnt appeal to me on its own, im entitled to that opinion."
11-11-2018T18:25:39,Bgrmystr2,then you seem to misunderstand tastes lol
11-11-2018T18:25:59,Bgrmystr2,I guarantee you there is a milk out there that you would like the taste of.
11-11-2018T18:26:04,Bgrmystr2,it does exist.
11-11-2018T18:26:49,CatzArt,Canada (USA's top hat) has this cookie thing called Tim Tams which are good compared to american cookies although they insist on calling them biscuits for some reason
11-11-2018T18:26:52,HobbitGames,"Oh, there are milks that I find more tolerable than others, but I just dont like drinkij g it separate from things. Tastes weird to me"
11-11-2018T18:26:53,ThingsAreMoving,"I... honestly can't taste any difference between milk brands, only difference I can taste is the fat content in milk."
11-11-2018T18:27:13,CatzArt,2% the whole way.
11-11-2018T18:27:19,ThingsAreMoving,"And ofc the difference between cow, sheep and goat's milk"
11-11-2018T18:27:32,HobbitGames,Dont forget himan
11-11-2018T18:27:36,ThingsAreMoving,"If milk has less than 3,2% then I refuse to call it milk"
11-11-2018T18:27:38,HobbitGames,Lol
11-11-2018T18:27:48,CatzArt,sheep and goats milk belongs in cheese and not in my glass
11-11-2018T18:28:08,CatzArt,fun fact hippo milk is pink.
11-11-2018T18:28:10,ThingsAreMoving,"Well I won't force you to drink it, Catz. More for me"
11-11-2018T18:28:27,HobbitGames,"Bgr, are you one of those people who would eat anything and just say ""it all goes down the same way!""?"
11-11-2018T18:29:12,Bgrmystr2,no
11-11-2018T18:29:14,CatzArt,The only thing that I wont try is bugs. Ill try anything else.
11-11-2018T18:29:15,HobbitGames,Ok
11-11-2018T18:29:16,Bgrmystr2,cuz I don't eat a LOT of things
11-11-2018T18:29:28,CatzArt,Bgr sounds like a picky eater
11-11-2018T18:29:29,HobbitGames,Thats not what i mean
11-11-2018T18:29:51,Bgrmystr2,"my taste buds are just sensitive, I can taste stuff by the smell if it's strong enough"
11-11-2018T18:29:52,HobbitGames,Are you a picky eater?
11-11-2018T18:30:03,HobbitGames,Same bo
11-11-2018T18:30:08,Bgrmystr2,"that's a loaded question, honestly."
11-11-2018T18:30:11,HobbitGames,ro!
11-11-2018T18:30:24,Bgrmystr2,"cuz I'm not actually a picky eater, there's just a lot of food I don't like the taste of"
11-11-2018T18:30:37,HobbitGames,"Well, not reallt you are or you arent"
11-11-2018T18:30:50,HobbitGames,I deginitely am
11-11-2018T18:30:52,CatzArt,like spam. spam is a nasty thing that shouldnt have been invented
11-11-2018T18:30:59,Bgrmystr2,"yeah it is. I can't control what I like in terms of taste, so I don't consider myself picky."
11-11-2018T18:31:07,Bgrmystr2,because I don't care what I eat of the foods I do eat
11-11-2018T18:31:15,Bgrmystr2,I'm not picky as such
11-11-2018T18:31:18,ThingsAreMoving,"Catz, hawaiians would argue with you"
11-11-2018T18:31:31,Bgrmystr2,"but I don't eat a lot of food, so people call me ""picky"" without bothering to look at the whole picture"
11-11-2018T18:31:51,HobbitGames,"Should you order from a fast food, would you have a specific list of things not to have on it?"
11-11-2018T18:32:17,CatzArt,Bgr how well do you tolerate spicy foods? and Things hawaii can have all the spam it once but salty mystery meat from a can is not for me
11-11-2018T18:32:24,Bgrmystr2,I don't do spicy period
11-11-2018T18:32:27,HobbitGames,Spicy foods are amazing
11-11-2018T18:32:28,ThingsAreMoving,Bgr doesn't do hot foods
11-11-2018T18:32:40,Bgrmystr2,"keep that shit away from me, I don't want to burn my taste buds off"
11-11-2018T18:32:47,Bgrmystr2,more for you xD
11-11-2018T18:32:52,ThingsAreMoving,yup
11-11-2018T18:33:05,HobbitGames,"Hahaha. They arent physicallt hot. And since you seem to like it so much, just drink some milk"
11-11-2018T18:33:09,CatzArt,Bgr would not survive in my house then. I dont even taste most peppers anymore
11-11-2018T18:33:25,Bgrmystr2,"Tis why I'm not in your house, Catz :P"
11-11-2018T18:33:39,CatzArt,well there is an ocean between us as well so theres that
11-11-2018T18:33:45,Bgrmystr2,yeah that too
11-11-2018T18:33:55,Bgrmystr2,but that's wayy less relevant than the spicy foods haha
11-11-2018T18:35:00,CatzArt,true still my city of Cleveland has an excellent farmers market with some of the best spicy sausage ever
11-11-2018T18:35:13,HobbitGames,"Over here a lot of our food is very bland, so spicy food goes a long way"
11-11-2018T18:35:27,ThingsAreMoving,"have you tried salt and pepper, Hobbit?"
11-11-2018T18:35:43,HobbitGames,Yes? Hasnt everyone? Not too keen on pepper thoug
11-11-2018T18:35:44,ThingsAreMoving,That's your first line of defense against bland food
11-11-2018T18:35:58,ThingsAreMoving,just checking
11-11-2018T18:36:06,HobbitGames,"Hahaha yes, obviously. But read the rest of the message"
11-11-2018T18:36:21,Bgrmystr2,"bland food doesn't get better just from spice, that only makes it worse imo"
11-11-2018T18:36:25,Bgrmystr2,add more flavor
11-11-2018T18:36:28,Bgrmystr2,not heat
11-11-2018T18:36:35,CatzArt,I get the impression Hobbit is from new Zealand. but it might just be his name.
11-11-2018T18:36:46,ThingsAreMoving,for some people the heat enhances the flavour
11-11-2018T18:36:50,HobbitGames,"No, we dont put spice on the bland food. Rhe spicy food is different"
11-11-2018T18:36:55,CatzArt,or its Zedland if were british
11-11-2018T18:37:00,HobbitGames,Mexican foods and stiff
11-11-2018T18:37:02,ThingsAreMoving,"but yeah, if a dish is bland, no amount of heat is gonna cover that"
11-11-2018T18:37:02,Bgrmystr2,"that's a mental thing, things xD"
11-11-2018T18:37:26,HobbitGames,Im irish
11-11-2018T18:37:36,CatzArt,Personally I just smoke everything in my smoker.
11-11-2018T18:37:48,ThingsAreMoving,I use herbs. A lot
11-11-2018T18:37:49,HobbitGames,I just love Tolkie
11-11-2018T18:37:53,HobbitGames,Tolkien*
11-11-2018T18:38:47,HobbitGames,"Also, its New Zealand in Britain?"
11-11-2018T18:38:59,ThingsAreMoving,whut
11-11-2018T18:39:08,HobbitGames,Oh i getvthe joke now. I feel silly
11-11-2018T18:39:20,HobbitGames,But it is zed
11-11-2018T18:39:31,CatzArt,North or south Ireland? Apparently it makes a difference. For a long time i just assumed it was a solid thing
11-11-2018T18:39:40,HobbitGames,"And if you come at me with ""jay-zee"", just dont"
11-11-2018T18:39:50,CatzArt,jay-zed
11-11-2018T18:40:04,HobbitGames,I am a proud citizen of the republic of Ireland
11-11-2018T18:40:18,Bgrmystr2,"It's a zee for me, fuck some zed"
11-11-2018T18:40:24,Bgrmystr2,there's no ed in the letter z
11-11-2018T18:40:30,Bgrmystr2,cuz that becomes a name
11-11-2018T18:40:33,HobbitGames,"Which is East, West, South and a  little bit of North of the island"
11-11-2018T18:40:40,Twokinds,I'm back
11-11-2018T18:40:40,CatzArt,south then.
11-11-2018T18:40:42,Twokinds,Disaster averted
11-11-2018T18:40:44,ThingsAreMoving,"So... is ""well, oil, beef, hooked"" the most common sentence in Ireland, or not?"
11-11-2018T18:40:45,Bgrmystr2,welcome back tom

11-11-2018T18:41:44,HobbitGames,Oh haha
11-11-2018T18:41:49,CatzArt,Does this relate to the fire last night?
11-11-2018T18:41:56,HobbitGames,Fire?
11-11-2018T18:41:59,Twokinds,It's not the first time this has happened.

11-11-2018T18:42:08,Bgrmystr2,well what help happened
11-11-2018T18:42:17,Twokinds,"I keep telling her, don't lock with the door, lock with the key fob and you'll never be locked out."
11-11-2018T18:42:19,ThingsAreMoving,Gotta write a sticky note on the fridge as a reminder to find that spare key soon
11-11-2018T18:42:36,ThingsAreMoving,just in case
11-11-2018T18:42:47,HobbitGames,We dont have those door locky yolks over here

11-11-2018T18:43:47,CatzArt,I remember one time I blew a tire out by trying to drive on a tire at 10psi when it should have been at 31psi. and i woundered why my care was wobbling funny.
11-11-2018T18:43:47,Bgrmystr2,maybe youtube will work now?

11-11-2018T20:47:03,CatzArt,Mystic I think tom would rather jump of a bridge. Lets not overwork our poor artist
11-11-2018T20:47:25,ThingsAreMoving,"Catz, we don't have to. He's doing it on his own pretty well xD"
11-11-2018T20:47:32,Vexd,"Wolves go to invade Dog territory, see a wall of puppies and just turn around going ""Nope!"""
11-11-2018T20:47:50,MysticAxe,well it was a thought not a demand... i would of corse pay the poor man..

11-11-2018T20:48:40,ThingsAreMoving,Foxes invaded their territory while wolves were gone and sold everything to the humans
11-11-2018T20:48:42,MysticAxe,coyotes wouldnt care though they are more vicous of the canine family..
11-11-2018T20:49:00,CrRAR,wily... if there ever was a word.
11-11-2018T20:49:15,CatzArt,coyotes are cool we study them as part of the urban coyote research program
11-11-2018T20:49:33,CatzArt,some animals adapt to urban environments well
11-11-2018T20:50:03,CrRAR,coyotes are pretty small and can hide pretty well
11-11-2018T20:50:06,ThingsAreMoving,like crocodiles in sewers? :ctwokinds-floraquestion:

11-11-2018T20:51:42,MysticAxe,well i ment as they are known to be crual and vicous. coyotes are known to have femals in the hunting packs and make them sound in heat. the guard dogs or normal pet dogs will investiage in the bush and be torn apart
11-11-2018T20:51:49,ThingsAreMoving,"Also that shading is gonna be legendary, once finished."
11-11-2018T20:52:21,unsteddyphoenix,Gonna be a massive shading explosion

11-11-2018T21:24:42,CatzArt,Soap its all just practice. It took me years to get to where I am now. just sketch a little bit each day and watch yourself improve slowly before your very eyes. plus we can give tips
11-11-2018T21:25:16,ZahnHolley,"But look on the brightside we have tom that can teach us, hes the master"
11-11-2018T21:25:24,CatzArt,I still cant hold a candle to tom. Takes me 6hrs to complete the lineart for a single character
11-11-2018T21:25:53,RimaDraws,tom has taught me by just watching him
11-11-2018T21:26:01,Zakuru,^
11-11-2018T21:26:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,You'll get faster with more practice Catz
11-11-2018T21:26:07,ZahnHolley,I had that feeling cat
11-11-2018T21:26:14,CatzArt,but compared to a few years ago i was know in my art class as the artist who never finished anything so a win in my book
11-11-2018T21:27:45,CatzArt,thanks for the support. But RIma is right I learned alot from watching tom.
11-11-2018T21:27:47,ZahnHolley,"goodthing we get to watch tom speed painting vids on youtube,"
11-11-2018T21:27:47,Dadrobit,S'been so many years since I took an actual visual arts class...

11-11-2018T21:28:27,Dadrobit,But that would cost a non-zero amount of money and time....
11-11-2018T21:28:31,RimaDraws,im a soon to be art associate graduate
11-11-2018T21:28:34,totallynotTrace,im currently taking the lowest level art class at my college

11-11-2018T21:32:15,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds like a good time
11-11-2018T21:32:23,Combak,Sounds like cannabalism to me
11-11-2018T21:32:27,CatzArt,Yeah also check out Draw with jazza if you wont want an any furry overtones
11-11-2018T21:32:28,unsteddyphoenix,Also true

11-11-2018T21:33:09,CatzArt,Jazza has alot of good stuff to. there are alot of youtube channels to show you the basics. But its all practice form there
11-11-2018T21:33:39,CatzArt,As for classes try Udemy. I bought a good art class on there for cheap when they had a sale
11-11-2018T21:34:08,ZahnHolley,Im a furry combak XD theres no need to roast furries?
11-11-2018T21:34:23,Combak,I wonder if Flora will comment on how the tigers reacted to her...

11-11-2018T21:38:03,ZahnHolley,"I got a little off track on tk i need to keep reading and get all caught up,"
11-11-2018T21:38:11,Dadrobit,Straight edge doesn't mean ~NO~ alcohol certainly.
11-11-2018T21:38:29,Dadrobit,Gotta have an Old Fashioned every once in a while ya know?

11-11-2018T21:40:28,Dadrobit,"I mean... You could? Sugar, iced water, non alcoholic bitters, and maybe some carbonation?"
11-11-2018T21:40:38,Dadrobit,"Ah, and the orange peel"
11-11-2018T21:41:08,Dadrobit,You'd just be the dude from the first Men In Black movie.
11-11-2018T21:41:23,Dadrobit,Sugar... More. Sugar....
11-11-2018T21:41:24,ShadowSoap,That was such a good movie

11-11-2018T22:17:54,MuonNeutrino,which assassin?
11-11-2018T22:17:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Non off them, that would have been fun tho XD"
11-11-2018T22:18:02,MuonNeutrino,"oh, right, clovis' dude"

11-11-2018T22:18:26,Dadrobit,"Nah, not Brutis. The other one"
11-11-2018T22:18:33,Dadrobit,"Wait, was that Brutis?"
11-11-2018T22:18:48,MuonNeutrino,"no that wasn't brutis, i dont think"
11-11-2018T22:19:21,RimaDraws,carver?
11-11-2018T22:19:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,carver is a fox boy
11-11-2018T22:19:31,MuonNeutrino,the unnamed one
11-11-2018T22:19:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,the one reni bitched slapped

11-11-2018T22:20:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,this lad
11-11-2018T22:20:59,Dadrobit,I think it may have been? http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/926/ and https://www.patreon.com/posts/springtime-fever-18266897
11-11-2018T22:21:04,RimaDraws,i tried
11-11-2018T22:21:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"same look, I guess they are the same dude"
11-11-2018T22:21:44,MuonNeutrino,eh... maybe
11-11-2018T22:21:44,Twokinds,Are those the same wolf?
11-11-2018T22:21:47,MuonNeutrino,hard to tell
11-11-2018T22:21:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,they look it
11-11-2018T22:21:52,MuonNeutrino,that's what we were wondering heh
11-11-2018T22:22:13,Twokinds,I don't think so.
11-11-2018T22:22:16,FennexTheFox,side sketches arent canon tho
11-11-2018T22:22:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,maybe they are twins
11-11-2018T22:22:37,MuonNeutrino,"well, that's the only place brutus has appeared at all"
11-11-2018T22:22:48,Dadrobit,"Ah, was thinking that sending Brutus off was a way to get him away from Clovis after the ""nightmare"" incident."
11-11-2018T22:22:51,Dadrobit,Just headcanon
11-11-2018T22:23:09,BigSonicFan,"You're not streaming, Tom? :\"

11-11-2018T22:23:38,unsteddyphoenix,"""the good looking one"" hmm... :thinking:"
11-11-2018T22:24:06,Dadrobit,"I think his official title on the forums was ""adorable wolf terrorist/assassin"""
11-11-2018T22:24:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Cute boy was what we called him on discord
11-11-2018T22:24:32,unsteddyphoenix,nic save
11-11-2018T22:24:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,cute murder boy
11-11-2018T22:24:59,Dadrobit,Natural 20
11-11-2018T22:25:06,Twokinds,I had a typo in today's post and it took a long time for anyone to catch it.
11-11-2018T22:25:30,BigSonicFan,Oh.
11-11-2018T22:25:36,MuonNeutrino,the nora card?
11-11-2018T22:26:10,Twokinds,"Yeah, I fixed it."
11-11-2018T22:26:25,MuonNeutrino,"right, well that explains why i can't find the mistake looking now ^^"
11-11-2018T22:26:31,Dadrobit,Was that why there was a deletion snafu going on earlier?
11-11-2018T22:26:43,RimaDraws,hmm?
11-11-2018T22:26:54,Twokinds,Huh? I fixed it just now
11-11-2018T22:27:27,BadFoMo,What was it?! I must know!
11-11-2018T22:27:39,Twokinds,pff
11-11-2018T22:27:49,Twokinds,"It was just ""you eyes"" instead of ""your eyes"""
11-11-2018T22:27:51,Twokinds,Apparently.
11-11-2018T22:28:44,Dadrobit,"Oh, and Marv, mostly it's been Bush, Incubus, Stone Temple Pilots, Tool, and a smattering of Pink Floyd since I saw the movie."
11-11-2018T22:29:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Ah, good choices those"
11-11-2018T22:29:15,FennexTheFox,"heh, i wonder if we are ever gonna see keidran trace in the comic"
11-11-2018T22:29:52,ZahnHolley,Gnight guys
11-11-2018T22:30:08,Dadrobit,o/ Zahn
11-11-2018T22:30:34,Dadrobit,"And yeah, I like to think so, Marv. Kind of a 90's-00's kick at the moment I guess."
11-11-2018T22:30:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I have that kick almost every day XD
11-11-2018T22:30:59,ZahnHolley,Anyway stay cool
11-11-2018T22:34:27,Dadrobit,"Bush is my guilty pleasure band. I don't think they're a particularly groundbreaking band in music, but goodness gracious it does bring me back to a happy place."
11-11-2018T22:36:15,Dadrobit,Just a really good alternative band that I listened to growing up. Very fondly recall making custom Star Craft maps with their music going on in the background.
11-11-2018T22:37:40,RimaDraws,my art isn't happening tonight
11-11-2018T22:39:45,RimaDraws,im too sore to do this
11-11-2018T22:40:00,BadFoMo,Sorry.
11-11-2018T22:41:16,Dadrobit,Speaking of Happy Place. Spyro Trilogy unlocks in an hour and 20 minutes. So my night is shot for productivity.
11-11-2018T22:41:35,Dadrobit,"And sorry to hear that, Rima. Anything in particular going wrong?"
11-11-2018T22:42:18,RimaDraws,just from work
11-11-2018T22:43:39,RimaDraws,its also no motivation and i feel down in the dumps about everything not going the way i need it to today
11-11-2018T22:46:08,RimaDraws,plus i didn't take my D3 supplement today and that helps my energy
11-11-2018T22:47:43,Dadrobit,:( Sorry to hear nothing's going to plan.
11-11-2018T22:48:10,RimaDraws,i just want to get this backlog done....and get to work on my comic like i want to...

11-11-2018T23:00:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,long enough for me to lay down some new flooring
11-11-2018T23:00:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeesh
11-11-2018T23:01:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Wonder if this is inspiration to get another spare made

11-11-2018T23:08:19,RimaDraws,its the coloring
11-11-2018T23:08:23,RimaDraws,its supposed to do that
11-11-2018T23:08:26,RimaDraws,like black icing
11-11-2018T23:08:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Well it looks like I ate a smurf
11-11-2018T23:08:58,RimaDraws,lol

11-11-2018T23:27:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Real annoying habit of waking up feeling that suspicious amount of rested at 6 in the morning these past few nights
11-11-2018T23:27:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m sure it’s the medicine
11-11-2018T23:31:08,Dadrobit,"Dream job as a job is fun on paper. But man, sometimes it kinda sucks. Not having a reliable source of income is scary as heck, and since home is where the work is, I legitimately have to leave home to get away from work."
11-11-2018T23:31:38,Dadrobit,"I mean, of course I still love it, but there are more than a few moments of consternation."
11-11-2018T23:41:19,RimaDraws,yea i know
11-11-2018T23:42:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Only thing I don’t like about my job is the people
11-11-2018T23:46:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I know eventually I’d want time out if I worked at home but I like just a tad bit of human socialization
11-11-2018T23:46:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Just with the right humans
