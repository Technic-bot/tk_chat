05-05-2018T00:55:50,Vatruvius,"Oh look, Tom is here! Hey Tom! :ptv-greetings:"
05-05-2018T01:29:45,unsteddyphoenix,Tom I noticed that anime reference you made last stream
05-05-2018T01:29:56,unsteddyphoenix,You thought you got away with it~
05-05-2018T01:30:42,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
05-05-2018T01:34:44,Vatruvius,Anime reference?
05-05-2018T01:37:49,SpazztasticKiwi,What are we still doing up
05-05-2018T01:38:13,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering: The question is.. what are YOU guys still doing up?
05-05-2018T01:38:23,Bgrmystr2,You probably have stuff to do tomorrow.
05-05-2018T01:38:45,SpazztasticKiwi,My cat’s sick and I’m don’t have work tomorrow
05-05-2018T01:38:55,SpazztasticKiwi,* I don’t
05-05-2018T01:41:12,Vatruvius,"It is the weekend, I am just sitting at home getting stuff done when I want to."
05-05-2018T01:44:46,Bgrmystr2,"lol, meh"
05-05-2018T01:45:12,Bgrmystr2,weekends are no different to me than weekdays atm
05-05-2018T02:57:57,Twokinds,Cats are so greedy for attention.
05-05-2018T03:00:52,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-katdryer: Shes drawn to your suffering
05-05-2018T03:01:23,unsteddyphoenix,More affectionate when your allergies are kicking in
05-05-2018T03:01:44,Twokinds,I need to buy a spray bottle
05-05-2018T03:02:02,unsteddyphoenix,Absolutely not!
05-05-2018T03:02:21,unsteddyphoenix,Just be affectionate back and she'll leave you alone
05-05-2018T03:02:51,unsteddyphoenix,Im pretty sure thats how cats work
05-05-2018T03:06:06,iliar,"All cats are different. For example, my friends have two cats. I know that they have it. I see that the cat's food is somewhere and then there are shit in the cat's toilet. I even saw the cats themselves ... once or twice."
05-05-2018T03:06:11,iliar,But most of the time they hide like real ninjas.
05-05-2018T03:06:43,Bgrmystr2,"be affectionate once, and they'll never leave you the fuck alone"
05-05-2018T03:06:54,Bgrmystr2,"otherwise, they would have avoided you from the beginning."
05-05-2018T03:07:10,Bgrmystr2,literally every single cat I've encountered is one or the other.
05-05-2018T03:07:17,Bgrmystr2,and I've met a lot
05-05-2018T03:09:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Mine are pretty affectionate. Bagheera will literally yell at you for ignoring him though
05-05-2018T03:11:25,Twokinds,"My cat, if I ignore her she ignores me."
05-05-2018T03:11:39,Twokinds,"But if I pet her, she wants pets. Pets. Pets. More pets. Pay attention!"
05-05-2018T03:11:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Well you offered first.
05-05-2018T03:12:06,SpazztasticKiwi,“Pet time? Ok”
05-05-2018T03:12:14,Twokinds,yeah but it's like... I can't pet you all day I've got work!
05-05-2018T03:12:27,Twokinds,@_@
05-05-2018T03:12:37,zolstarym,Mine makes the saddest most pathetic meows at me when she is hungry
05-05-2018T03:12:39,Bgrmystr2,TOO LATE! Pet time :kissing_cat:
05-05-2018T03:12:46,zolstarym,she knows my weakness
05-05-2018T03:12:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Too bad. Cats run on affection and kibble
05-05-2018T03:12:58,iliar,No. They are not afraid of me or anyone else. Sometimes (very rarely) they may seem. Will receive a portion of attention and then just dissolve.
05-05-2018T03:12:58,unsteddyphoenix,Ehhh
05-05-2018T03:13:03,SpazztasticKiwi,And some run on spite
05-05-2018T03:13:05,unsteddyphoenix,less work more peat
05-05-2018T03:13:15,Bgrmystr2,xD ^
05-05-2018T03:13:27,Bgrmystr2,'peat'
05-05-2018T03:14:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"The advantages of having a get out of the house job is I do get breaks from getting pestered, but Bagheera and Kiwi both are also often content to sit in my lap"
05-05-2018T03:14:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I can’t pet? They sit and let me know they’re there
05-05-2018T03:15:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless I’m on YouTube. Both have mixed feelings about certain YouTubers
05-05-2018T03:17:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Holly could be telling you you work too much too. Petting her may not be the best for your comfort but neither is working constantly
05-05-2018T03:26:10,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
05-05-2018T03:27:18,unsteddyphoenix,Thats pretty optmistic
05-05-2018T03:28:07,unsteddyphoenix,Shes probably confused about why Toms doing other things that arent related to her.
05-05-2018T03:38:54,SpazztasticKiwi,“What you you doing? Looks fun. Can I help? Pet me.”
05-05-2018T03:54:43,SpazztasticKiwi,In other news I got Bagheera to eat some more
05-05-2018T04:02:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"And with him seeming to be more stable, I’m going on to bed"
05-05-2018T04:32:30,NickTheName,Good Morning!
05-05-2018T07:54:41,NightMeaty22,Good morning everyone
05-05-2018T10:56:10,Vatruvius,Morning everyone! :ptv-greetings:
05-05-2018T10:56:26,Vatruvius,Hey Tom! Sifting through all the suggestion?
05-05-2018T11:19:34,Twokinds,Sorta
05-05-2018T11:21:18,Vatruvius,Just doing some between other things?
05-05-2018T11:38:52,Twokinds,"Comic, actually."
05-05-2018T11:39:25,Vatruvius,Ah...the speech/thought bubbles.
05-05-2018T11:40:17,Twokinds,"Yeah, it's a pain in the butt sometimes."
05-05-2018T11:40:32,Twokinds,"Especially when my cat keeps going ""hey, hey, what are you talking about? Hey!"""
05-05-2018T11:41:55,Xexanoth,"if your cat is talking to you, you probably should see a doctor"
05-05-2018T11:41:59,Vatruvius,lol
05-05-2018T11:42:04,Xexanoth,:ptv-shock:
05-05-2018T11:42:30,Vatruvius,The speech bubbles are getting to him.
05-05-2018T11:42:48,Xexanoth,or he just has a magic cat
05-05-2018T11:43:18,Vatruvius,It was Nora the whole time! :ptv-laugh:
05-05-2018T11:43:42,NickTheName,"if you see a doctor, you probably should  talk to your cat."
05-05-2018T11:44:19,Vatruvius,:thinking:
05-05-2018T11:45:01,iliar,"Technically, it's a lot like Tom talking to his cat. Tom talking and in the room is no one else in the room except the cat and Tom."
05-05-2018T11:46:57,Vatruvius,Let me know if my sketch suggestion does not work Tom.
05-05-2018T11:47:05,Vatruvius,If you get to it.
05-05-2018T11:57:21,iliar,New page http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/1026/
05-05-2018T11:57:41,NickTheName,Thank you
05-05-2018T11:58:37,Vatruvius,"One sec, gotta read."
05-05-2018T12:00:43,Vatruvius,Very cool! Totally forgot that Zen would know everything Natani went through.
05-05-2018T12:04:56,Vatruvius,Now I am looking forward to the face to face Zen and Keith confrontation.
05-05-2018T12:05:00,Vatruvius,:ptv-ohmy:
05-05-2018T12:20:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe that’s why she hovers around him so much. Wondering why he’s sitting at that glowing window muttering to himself
05-05-2018T12:21:19,SpazztasticKiwi,“Must check my human to make sure he is not going crazy”
05-05-2018T12:29:53,MidnightBlue78,Hi guys
05-05-2018T12:29:59,MidnightBlue78,:ptv-greetings:
05-05-2018T12:30:28,NickTheName,good evening
05-05-2018T12:31:35,Vatruvius,Hello!
05-05-2018T12:32:33,NickTheName,Oh wait... different time zone... Good afternoon? :D
05-05-2018T12:33:11,Vatruvius,"Still morning for me, 10:30."
05-05-2018T12:35:05,NickTheName,"As you might guess, it is evening here (19:34)"
05-05-2018T12:35:20,NickTheName,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
05-05-2018T13:15:05,Vatruvius,"Why are my Z, X, and CTRL keys working now! They were not working for weeks and not even this morning and now they are responding as if nothing has been going on!?"
05-05-2018T13:15:10,Vatruvius,Z
05-05-2018T13:15:11,Vatruvius,X
05-05-2018T13:15:15,Vatruvius,Agh!
05-05-2018T13:17:17,PhilTheIdle,@Nick We have the same time zone. Yay!
05-05-2018T13:18:48,NickTheName,"How can you survive weeks without Z, X and CTRL?"
05-05-2018T13:19:04,NickTheName,@Phil MESZ Masterrace!
05-05-2018T13:19:13,Vatruvius,"It has been rough, let me tell you."
05-05-2018T13:19:55,NickTheName,CEST*
05-05-2018T13:20:43,Vatruvius,"I can't play 95% of the games I own because of thr controls that are bound to Z, X, or CTRL."
05-05-2018T13:20:51,Vatruvius,the*
05-05-2018T13:21:12,PhilTheIdle,@Vatruvius You can change controls.
05-05-2018T13:21:23,PhilTheIdle,@Nick I know my time zone.
05-05-2018T13:21:59,Vatruvius,I know I can. Just muscle memory and some games have too many controls.
05-05-2018T13:22:18,NickTheName,Why didn't you buy a new keyboard?
05-05-2018T13:22:23,PhilTheIdle,"Ok, that's a thing."
05-05-2018T13:24:15,NickTheName,@Phill where are you from?
05-05-2018T13:24:22,PhilTheIdle,Germany
05-05-2018T13:24:33,PhilTheIdle,"Oh, it's one ""l"""
05-05-2018T13:24:50,PhilTheIdle,What about you?
05-05-2018T13:26:06,NickTheName,Also Germany (near luxemburg border)
05-05-2018T13:26:56,Vatruvius,It is a laptop keyboard.
05-05-2018T13:27:29,PhilTheIdle,"I'm from Fulda, in the east of hessia."
05-05-2018T13:33:17,NickTheName,@Vatruvius That sucks
05-05-2018T13:34:10,Vatruvius,"Got it repaired and it happened again, now it works fine."
05-05-2018T13:34:28,Vatruvius,I am skeptical.
05-05-2018T13:34:48,PhilTheIdle,for good reason i suppose
05-05-2018T13:35:16,NickTheName,"@Phill with one ""l"" I Hate the west Hessian ""Autobahn""...  construction sites everywhere"
05-05-2018T13:36:21,PhilTheIdle,I didn't even notice one.
05-05-2018T13:38:52,SiliconCarbide,huh more germans? look at that
05-05-2018T13:38:58,NickTheName,"1-2 years ago I was once visiting there and every few kilometers greeted me with a sign saying  ""Oh Je eine Baustelle"""
05-05-2018T13:39:13,PhilTheIdle,You too? @SiliconCarbrde
05-05-2018T13:39:16,SiliconCarbide,yep
05-05-2018T13:40:04,NickTheName,The GThe Germans will take over the world (again)!ermans Too
05-05-2018T13:40:16,PhilTheIdle,@Nick Well if you say so. I never leave my house so I don't really notive anything.
05-05-2018T13:40:25,NickTheName,xD
05-05-2018T13:40:47,SiliconCarbide,gotte get the austrians on board first
05-05-2018T13:41:21,NickTheName,But this time without italy!
05-05-2018T13:41:27,PhilTheIdle,"You mean, like Hindenburg did?"
05-05-2018T14:00:32,PhilTheIdle,Shouldn't the stream start right now?
05-05-2018T14:02:24,SiliconCarbide,na 1h still
05-05-2018T14:03:17,PhilTheIdle,Oh...ok
05-05-2018T14:04:18,Vatruvius,"Yeah, another hour."
05-05-2018T14:26:18,Twokinds,Suggestions need to be reasonable...
05-05-2018T14:26:34,Twokinds,"They can't have a lot of characters, or require multiple panels to work."
05-05-2018T14:30:16,BluePhantom90,so that short comic idea wont do?
05-05-2018T14:31:57,BadFoMo,Two (2) simple panels would be the max. ...I think.
05-05-2018T14:32:04,Vatruvius,Whoops more paragraphs this week? Was mine okay?
05-05-2018T14:32:21,BadFoMo,"...Also, is my request ok?"
05-05-2018T14:33:19,BluePhantom90,"I put (sort comic) about )King Adelaid's Mid life crisis, the desire for another child!"
05-05-2018T14:33:36,FenceEqualizer,B-but my novels! (Jk)
05-05-2018T14:35:05,Mippy,Did not think I would make it but the train decided to back up
05-05-2018T14:36:34,Twokinds,Uh...
05-05-2018T14:36:53,Twokinds,I don't care for the theme.
05-05-2018T14:36:57,Twokinds,To be honest.
05-05-2018T14:38:52,Twokinds,"Man, a lot of these suggestions I need to message the suggestor about. I just can't draw something inolving... 8 characters."
05-05-2018T14:39:10,Twokinds,"Also one's a spoiler for a movie I haven't seen yet, so... sigh... lol"
05-05-2018T14:39:27,BadFoMo,"So, I need to change mine?"
05-05-2018T14:39:27,Xexanoth,ouch
05-05-2018T14:39:27,CrRAR,tsk tsk
05-05-2018T14:39:31,BluePhantom90,I take the Avengers?
05-05-2018T14:39:34,InTheLionsDen,Veto and move on.
05-05-2018T14:39:34,CrRAR,that's diabolical XD
05-05-2018T14:39:35,Twokinds,Yeah.
05-05-2018T14:40:12,qwe304,"maybe just put them all on one screen after the last vote, next to an explination as to why they werent acceptable, that way people dont suggest somthing similar"
05-05-2018T14:40:30,BadFoMo,Would ‘Maeve buries Keith and Natani at the beach and fashion Merfolk tails for them while Maddie and Karen build Sandcastle forts.’ be ok?
05-05-2018T14:40:45,CrRAR,hehe
05-05-2018T14:41:02,BadFoMo,No second panel.
05-05-2018T14:41:17,CrRAR,I feel like that's a run-on suggestion.
05-05-2018T14:41:18,Twokinds,"Yes, that's fine."
05-05-2018T14:41:29,BadFoMo,Cool!
05-05-2018T14:41:31,Twokinds,"Well, it's a lot of characters."
05-05-2018T14:41:39,qwe304,"would ""noras first prank"" be a spoiler?"
05-05-2018T14:41:51,BluePhantom90,So would that ( short comic) with )King Adelaid's Mid life crisis be alright?
05-05-2018T14:42:10,FenceEqualizer,Might get some people upset at the call out...though someone spoiling a movie with it sucks big time
05-05-2018T14:42:16,Twokinds,"No. I can do it, but it'd have to be simplified. I can't make a comic."
05-05-2018T14:42:27,Twokinds,"It'd take too long on stream, it'd eat other suggestion's time."
05-05-2018T14:42:53,BluePhantom90,yeah I said maybe three panels at most
05-05-2018T14:42:54,qwe304,"I had infinity war spoiled before it even released in the US, dang australians"
05-05-2018T14:43:17,BadFoMo,Changed.
05-05-2018T14:43:18,Twokinds,"Nora's first prank... well, I don't know what that would be."
05-05-2018T14:43:29,Twokinds,I can draw something if someone tells me what the prank is.
05-05-2018T14:43:35,Twokinds,But suggestions have to be specific.
05-05-2018T14:43:40,qwe304,somthing hilarious hopefully
05-05-2018T14:43:50,BluePhantom90,wait didn't you already do one like that. When Nora gave a human girl Bunny ears?
05-05-2018T14:44:05,qwe304,that sounds familiar actually
05-05-2018T14:44:09,FenceEqualizer,Knowing Nora it'd probably involve changing going wrong heh
05-05-2018T14:44:09,qwe304,one sec
05-05-2018T14:44:10,Twokinds,"Yeah, it'd also be pretty similiar to thatone."
05-05-2018T14:44:22,Mippy,Cling wrap on the toilette.... IDK
05-05-2018T14:44:45,Xexanoth,Nora first prank would probably just be an accident...
05-05-2018T14:45:00,qwe304,tbh the point of my idea was just to get more young nora
05-05-2018T14:45:00,Xexanoth,and then she developed the taste for it
05-05-2018T14:45:03,Twokinds,I'm going to delay the sketch stream until Monday. I need to message some suggestors and give time to change things.
05-05-2018T14:45:06,BluePhantom90,Is this guy just trolling wanting You to do the same old ones but slightly altered? Because that Nat nuzzling Keith with a scarf was the same one just with the slight differance
05-05-2018T14:45:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Stream tomorrow then?
05-05-2018T14:45:52,Xexanoth,"Bleu Phantom, the suggestion didn't even have ""nuzzling"" in it"
05-05-2018T14:45:54,SiliconCarbide,awwwww
05-05-2018T14:45:58,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: okay tom
05-05-2018T14:46:14,Xexanoth,"it was something alonh the lines of ""keith gets a reward for giving Natani a scarf"""
05-05-2018T14:46:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,If thats true the nighty night ya'll going back to bed &lt;3
05-05-2018T14:46:19,qwe304,"i'd say just message them and let them fix it for next time, there have always been suggestions that arent acceptable"
05-05-2018T14:46:42,qwe304,youve never delayed a stream for that before
05-05-2018T14:47:10,Mippy,"Some people just don't quite grasp the consept of ""Keep it simple, stupid"""
05-05-2018T14:47:15,BluePhantom90,same pic just a scarf added
05-05-2018T14:47:21,FenceEqualizer,Well that must be a lot of funky suggestions to delay a stream
05-05-2018T14:47:41,Xexanoth,"also you probably should put more guidelines for suggestion in, since the suggestion apparently become worse and worse...."
05-05-2018T14:48:14,FenceEqualizer,Is it worse and worse or just one week that was an explosion
05-05-2018T14:48:26,BadFoMo,Should I make a list of all my request that have been snubbed and invite others to add to the list so we know what NOT to request?
05-05-2018T14:48:48,FenceEqualizer,Errr...
05-05-2018T14:49:27,BadFoMo,...It might help. ...maybe.
05-05-2018T14:49:34,FenceEqualizer,Not sure if that'll help Tom might have to just make a new guideline
05-05-2018T14:50:00,FenceEqualizer,Or have it more in your face since chances are people just didn't read it
05-05-2018T14:50:06,Dadrobit,"Hmmmm, Tom. Have you seen Akira?"
05-05-2018T14:50:08,qwe304,&gt;4 characters should be made an official rule
05-05-2018T14:50:13,qwe304,*&lt;4
05-05-2018T14:50:18,Twokinds,I have no

05-05-2018T14:50:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"its really good, would recommend"
05-05-2018T14:50:41,gone46,t time?
05-05-2018T14:50:43,FenceEqualizer,But..Akita is a classic!

05-05-2018T14:51:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,it will also help with dad suggestion
05-05-2018T14:51:17,Mippy,No opinion on Akira. I was ...like 13 when I saw it and haven't seen it since. Can't remember what happend
05-05-2018T14:51:29,TorqueEmUp,"It's good, I wouldn't say it's nearly as amazing as people let on, but still damn good."
05-05-2018T14:51:42,BadFoMo,"Trolls saying ""You have no tail?! You poor thing!""."
05-05-2018T14:51:45,Mippy,I remember being confused
05-05-2018T14:51:47,TorqueEmUp,Bought the Bluray recently and rewatched it with friends.
05-05-2018T14:51:48,FenceEqualizer,That's good enough
05-05-2018T14:52:10,FenceEqualizer,I remember man faced children
05-05-2018T14:52:19,TorqueEmUp,"But yeah, a good portion of the movie you are just like ""What the fuck is going on?!"""
05-05-2018T14:52:21,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it's actually amazing. Just re-watched it last month, absolutely classic."
05-05-2018T14:52:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,and that slide
05-05-2018T14:52:39,Dadrobit,Hngggg
05-05-2018T14:52:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,so good
05-05-2018T14:53:17,Dadrobit,"The slide is only about 7 minutes in, so it doesn't spoil too much lol."
05-05-2018T14:53:19,qwe304,I most likely wont be able to watch a monday stream :ctwokinds-LauraCry:
05-05-2018T14:53:27,TerraTheWizard,boop
05-05-2018T14:53:28,Vatruvius,"@BluePhantom90, the scarf sketch was mine. I did not specify nuzzling or anything, just ""Keith gets some unexpected feminine affection."" Tom did the rest."
05-05-2018T14:53:33,Dadrobit,Same. I got finals on Monday.
05-05-2018T14:53:34,TerraTheWizard,"oh, no stream today?"
05-05-2018T14:53:50,Twokinds,"Alright, I'll try."
05-05-2018T14:54:03,FenceEqualizer,No stream till tomorrow
05-05-2018T14:54:04,Dadrobit,We're throwing a party in the studio to watch everyone's projects with.
05-05-2018T14:54:04,iliar,"About Nora. I want know more about Trace and Nora relationship, but I don't know how to suggest it."
05-05-2018T14:54:13,iliar,"I mean, we almost do not know anything about the Trace and Nora relationship. I do not want to invent my own story. I want know canon story. Maybe you can get little spoilers, which could be used as a basis for sketch idias."
05-05-2018T14:54:30,Mippy,"I don't have to work Monday, so I'm one of those peopple who would be good"
05-05-2018T14:54:43,Dadrobit,"Professors are bringing the pizza, someone else's got the cookies, I'm bringing a home made pie."
05-05-2018T14:54:45,Vatruvius,I have no classes Monday so I am all good here!
05-05-2018T14:55:06,Mippy,"Dad,"
05-05-2018T14:55:09,Bgrmystr2,Doin jack diddly on monday so I'm fine as usual.
05-05-2018T14:55:13,FenceEqualizer,Dad stop! I don't want to think about delicious food now &gt;&lt;
05-05-2018T14:55:15,Mippy,That sounds pretty good
05-05-2018T14:55:16,BluePhantom90,I have to work money. e-e
05-05-2018T14:55:22,BluePhantom90,*Monday
05-05-2018T14:55:23,Dadrobit,Yes. Yes it does.
05-05-2018T14:55:32,Dadrobit,Easiest final exam ever.
05-05-2018T14:56:09,Dadrobit,"Professor already told me I got an A, so it's all cruise control for that class now."
05-05-2018T14:56:28,Dadrobit,Just one more written final on Tuesday and the semester is done.
05-05-2018T14:56:45,Mippy,Cool
05-05-2018T14:57:10,Mippy,I got mostly B's this sememester...
05-05-2018T14:57:30,Twokinds,Stream starts at 4:30
05-05-2018T14:57:32,Dadrobit,And it's whatever about the stream time either tomorrow or today. Gonna miss most/all of it anyway. Heading over to the grandma's house in an hour or so to hang out with her for a while.
05-05-2018T14:57:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,oki dok Tom
05-05-2018T14:57:39,FenceEqualizer,"Illar, maybe short suggestions like the moment Nora realize she like Trace"" or something to that effect of course could be spoiler stuff but just keep things lite"
05-05-2018T14:57:42,Dadrobit,Ah well.
05-05-2018T14:57:42,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering:
05-05-2018T14:57:51,Channelfiction,4:30 tomorrow?
05-05-2018T14:57:54,Mippy,@Twokinds Alright
05-05-2018T14:57:57,Twokinds,TODAY
05-05-2018T14:58:00,Channelfiction,Awesome!
05-05-2018T14:58:06,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-excited:
05-05-2018T14:58:08,Dadrobit,Lol.
05-05-2018T14:58:12,Twokinds,"Hopefully, my stomach problems go away before it starts."
05-05-2018T14:58:14,FenceEqualizer,I'll be here with my busted back stuck in bed
05-05-2018T14:58:26,Vatruvius,"Stomach problems, have you eaten yet?"
05-05-2018T14:58:26,Zakuru,ginger ale tom
05-05-2018T14:58:35,Mippy,That sounds horrible Fence
05-05-2018T14:58:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Tom, do you have anything with peppermint, that helps sooth stomachs"
05-05-2018T14:58:43,Dadrobit,"Nah man, don't do it if you're not feeling well. S'only gonna make it worse on yourself."
05-05-2018T14:59:03,Twokinds,Don't have either of those things.
05-05-2018T14:59:05,TorqueEmUp,"Ooof, sorry to hear about stomach issues. Those are the worst."
05-05-2018T14:59:09,FenceEqualizer,"It is Mippy, also if you feel bad Tom don't force it"
05-05-2018T14:59:10,Twokinds,And it won't help.
05-05-2018T14:59:22,PhilTheIdle,You could try to ignore the pain.
05-05-2018T14:59:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"peppermint oil, I forgot to put oil -_-"
05-05-2018T14:59:59,iliar,@FenceEqualizer Well... It's not sounds like good suggestion. But it's better then nothing. Thank you.
05-05-2018T15:00:04,FenceEqualizer,So just peppermint?
05-05-2018T15:00:14,BluePhantom90,don't have a store near by to get some tums or pepto?
05-05-2018T15:00:14,TerraTheWizard,never even heard of peppermint oil before...
05-05-2018T15:00:25,PhilTheIdle,Me neither
05-05-2018T15:00:31,BadFoMo,Same.
05-05-2018T15:00:33,FenceEqualizer,It was an example don't have to use that just a way to keep things small
05-05-2018T15:00:36,Dadrobit,":/ That stuff never worked on me tbh. Always just Tums/Pepto Bismo, or purge it..."
05-05-2018T15:00:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,well things like Altoids have it. and those help me out when ever I have stomach issues
05-05-2018T15:00:43,Vatruvius,Would any of you be interested in a sketch with Saria? Something to do with her relationship with Trace pre-comic or currently?
05-05-2018T15:00:46,TorqueEmUp,"or just any antacid really, I find Tums does jackshit."
05-05-2018T15:00:48,Mippy,I'm gonna be that person and say I have
05-05-2018T15:01:06,PhilTheIdle,@Vatruvius I liked Saria.
05-05-2018T15:01:13,qwe304,same phil
05-05-2018T15:01:13,Bgrmystr2,"tums is heartburn, Torque"
05-05-2018T15:01:14,Dadrobit,"That sounds maybe very spoiler heavy, vat."
05-05-2018T15:01:21,qwe304,saria is best girl tbh
05-05-2018T15:01:22,Bgrmystr2,not the same as pain in your stomache
05-05-2018T15:01:24,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Hello all! I see we are talking about the indigestion that bgr so easily causes whenever he speaks! &gt;:D
05-05-2018T15:01:25,TorqueEmUp,Never helped my heartburn either
05-05-2018T15:01:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,HI KopyKat
05-05-2018T15:01:40,Dadrobit,Tums is a Godsend for my heartburn.
05-05-2018T15:01:52,Vatruvius,Saria sounds spoiler heavy Dadro?
05-05-2018T15:01:57,Mippy,I prefer Eno for Heart burn
05-05-2018T15:01:59,FenceEqualizer,Dang kopykat with the sucker punch
05-05-2018T15:02:00,Dadrobit,"Shit goes from ""heart attack"" to relief in seconds."
05-05-2018T15:02:11,Bgrmystr2,"Same, Dadro. I take it and the pain literally disappears in a few seconds. Permanantly."
05-05-2018T15:02:23,Bgrmystr2,"Fuck the ""disappears in minutes"" shit, who wants that?"
05-05-2018T15:02:31,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I have a sneaking suspicion a lot of that old stuff is gonna show it's head again in the mansion."
05-05-2018T15:02:32,PhilTheIdle,Isn't alcohol said to be a painkiller?
05-05-2018T15:02:36,FenceEqualizer,I would right now
05-05-2018T15:02:43,TorqueEmUp,Actually best stuff i've used are just acid reducers. Antacids just make things come back worse.
05-05-2018T15:02:47,Mippy,Tums will due in a pinch but are not as good
05-05-2018T15:02:59,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"I'll be back in a bit, cooking potatoes and eating lunch."
05-05-2018T15:03:08,ItsActuallyKopyKat,probs in time for the stream start
05-05-2018T15:03:15,FenceEqualizer,Cept less heart burn more back help
05-05-2018T15:03:20,PhilTheIdle,I'm eatin easter bunnies from lindt.
05-05-2018T15:03:21,Vatruvius,"Maybe Dadro, but I would like to see if people would be interested in such a sketch suggestion before I really think on it."
05-05-2018T15:03:21,Bgrmystr2,"lol Kopy, still hasn't realized my face makes people's lives miserable"
05-05-2018T15:03:30,Bgrmystr2,:u
05-05-2018T15:03:37,PhilTheIdle,I'd be interested.
05-05-2018T15:03:44,Vatruvius,After I thought of it I will ask Tom if it could be a spoiler later.
05-05-2018T15:04:07,TorqueEmUp,"Tom should tell you whether it is or not, because then it is spoiled."
05-05-2018T15:04:09,Dadrobit,But what about the Jazz Bar?
05-05-2018T15:04:11,TorqueEmUp,shouldn't*
05-05-2018T15:04:17,SielSinn,when does it start?
05-05-2018T15:04:24,Dadrobit,4:30
05-05-2018T15:04:48,FenceEqualizer,^
05-05-2018T15:04:59,Mippy,What Dad said
05-05-2018T15:05:05,NeonMitsumi,"Jazz Bar, you say? :cneonmitsumi-nibsax:"
05-05-2018T15:05:10,SielSinn,ooooh!! 30 minutes
05-05-2018T15:05:11,Vatruvius,"Still have it, this week I submitted a Maren/Trace date thing pre-comic. Seemed very popular and I really liked it. Depending on how popular it is in the polls in the stream will determine if I keep suggesting it or go to the Jazz Bar."
05-05-2018T15:05:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Nyyom
05-05-2018T15:05:24,NeonMitsumi,Heyya :cneonmitsumi-katgoesnyooooom:
05-05-2018T15:05:28,NickTheName,"Well, I have to get up early tomorrow. Good night (damn time zones)"
05-05-2018T15:05:40,Vatruvius,good night Nick.
05-05-2018T15:05:42,PhilTheIdle,Night.
05-05-2018T15:05:45,Bgrmystr2,Heya Neon
05-05-2018T15:05:48,FenceEqualizer,Hi Neon
05-05-2018T15:05:49,SielSinn,hey neon
05-05-2018T15:05:51,TorqueEmUp,"I hate when you get that trapped air near the opening of your stomach, feels like your constantly getting stabbed in the gut."
05-05-2018T15:05:55,PhilTheIdle,Wait... at 10pm?
05-05-2018T15:06:28,Vatruvius,He just blamed time zones Phil.
05-05-2018T15:06:28,Bgrmystr2,"Lol not everyone lives in the same Time Zone you do, bro"
05-05-2018T15:06:40,Bgrmystr2,xD
05-05-2018T15:06:55,Vatruvius,"No, wait. The two of them live in Germany right?"
05-05-2018T15:07:01,SiliconCarbide,yeah
05-05-2018T15:07:01,PhilTheIdle,Yeah
05-05-2018T15:07:10,Mippy,Yeah....10PM lol
05-05-2018T15:07:11,Vatruvius,Maybe he likes to be more responsible then the rest of us.
05-05-2018T15:07:20,PhilTheIdle,Maybe
05-05-2018T15:07:22,SiliconCarbide,6h of sleep are easily sufficient
05-05-2018T15:07:23,SiliconCarbide,!
05-05-2018T15:07:26,Bgrmystr2,Some people wake up early in the morning
05-05-2018T15:07:29,SielSinn,but why go to bed at 10 when you could watch tom stream??
05-05-2018T15:07:36,Mippy,I need juice...brb
05-05-2018T15:07:37,Bgrmystr2,"I'd say 8, Silicon. 6 does very little"
05-05-2018T15:07:38,PhilTheIdle,Dunno
05-05-2018T15:07:48,Dadrobit,I miss having the drive to wake up early tbh.
05-05-2018T15:07:50,FenceEqualizer,Sleep/work
05-05-2018T15:08:14,Dadrobit,It was nice to get a workout/shower in before the day got really going.
05-05-2018T15:08:19,SiliconCarbide,"i used to sleep 8h+ but i donnu, it changed the last 2 years, im a pretty light sleeper, might have to do with that"
05-05-2018T15:08:20,Bgrmystr2,"I always hated waking up early, even when I was a kid, some things never change.."
05-05-2018T15:08:33,Vatruvius,"I am sure they want to watch the stream, but wanting to and being able to are two different things."
05-05-2018T15:08:39,FenceEqualizer,I am with you on that Robit
05-05-2018T15:08:45,PhilTheIdle,I stay in the bed till noon if I can
05-05-2018T15:08:46,SielSinn,^
05-05-2018T15:08:47,Dadrobit,"Now I'm like, ""11:20am? Fuck it, snooze button."""
05-05-2018T15:08:48,Bgrmystr2,indeed vatru
05-05-2018T15:09:40,Mippy,"So, what I thought was aa jug of water in the fridge is actually clear juice...."
05-05-2018T15:09:56,Vatruvius,Clear juice?
05-05-2018T15:09:58,PhilTheIdle,ehhh...what?
05-05-2018T15:10:06,SiliconCarbide,sounds like a win to me
05-05-2018T15:10:09,NeonMitsumi,Pepsi Crystal
05-05-2018T15:10:17,Mippy,It's the strangest thing Vat
05-05-2018T15:10:19,Vatruvius,That is not a juice Neon.
05-05-2018T15:10:41,Mippy,It taste kind of tropical and is actually very refreshing
05-05-2018T15:10:42,Vatruvius,"What ""juice"" did you drink?"
05-05-2018T15:10:56,Vatruvius,Tropical :thinking:
05-05-2018T15:10:56,NeonMitsumi,"If Mayonnaise can be an instrument, Pepsi can be juice."
05-05-2018T15:11:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,saving that
05-05-2018T15:11:10,Dadrobit,Pepsi Crystal is not a juice. It is a nectar.
05-05-2018T15:11:11,Vatruvius,But anything can be made into an instrument.
05-05-2018T15:11:17,Xexanoth,so propably something like pineapple
05-05-2018T15:11:25,NeonMitsumi,@Vatruvius Exactly.
05-05-2018T15:11:28,PhilTheIdle,might just sound shitty
05-05-2018T15:11:46,Vatruvius,Not everything can be made into a juice.
05-05-2018T15:11:59,Vatruvius,An instrument is more open ended than juice.
05-05-2018T15:11:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,can you juice me Vat?
05-05-2018T15:12:03,Mippy,Yeah...it'd kind of like a pineapple had a baby with a coconut
05-05-2018T15:12:11,FenceEqualizer,How the heck is mayo an instrument?
05-05-2018T15:12:21,Vatruvius,"Google it, you will fine out."
05-05-2018T15:12:32,Vatruvius,find*
05-05-2018T15:13:03,NeonMitsumi,Anything can be used as an instrument.
05-05-2018T15:13:05,Vatruvius,"With today's equipment, anything can create a sound that is turned into music. Just they way the world is now."
05-05-2018T15:13:22,Dadrobit,I feel the internet has gotten more sane in recent years.
05-05-2018T15:13:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,?
05-05-2018T15:13:35,PhilTheIdle,youre joking
05-05-2018T15:13:35,Vatruvius,One can only hope.
05-05-2018T15:13:44,BadFoMo,@NeonMitsumi If you're brave enough?
05-05-2018T15:13:45,FenceEqualizer,"I googled it and immediately said ""god damn it internet """
05-05-2018T15:13:46,WereKeidran,appears from a waterspout
05-05-2018T15:13:52,Mippy,The early days were rough Dad
05-05-2018T15:13:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Were
05-05-2018T15:14:00,NeonMitsumi,"@BadFoMo Skilled enough, in this case."
05-05-2018T15:14:09,Vatruvius,Hey Were.
05-05-2018T15:14:17,Dadrobit,"The ""weird shit"" to Google has gone from stuff like blue waffle and Goatse to ""mayonnaise as an instrument."""
05-05-2018T15:14:33,FenceEqualizer,The Wild West of the internet days
05-05-2018T15:14:36,TerraTheWizard,:thinking:
05-05-2018T15:14:48,NeonMitsumi,Are you sure that you haven't just gone more insane?
05-05-2018T15:14:54,Mippy,...We dod not bring up waffles of taht colour here Dad
05-05-2018T15:15:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"And I'm gonna have early internet nightmares again, thanks Dad"
05-05-2018T15:15:24,FenceEqualizer,Something's are just forever Marv
05-05-2018T15:15:36,Vatruvius,"If that was the Wild West and it is getting tamer, then does that mean we have not even reached the ""modern"" days of the internet? Because right now, the modern days are weird in real life, I do not need the internet to get weirder than the Wild West days"
05-05-2018T15:15:56,Dadrobit,Well that's kind of my point Marv. That old shit is nightmare fuel. Mayonnaise dreams are just a weird trip.
05-05-2018T15:16:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,or a gintama episode
05-05-2018T15:16:20,FenceEqualizer,When we can go SAO with the internet then it will be modern
05-05-2018T15:16:29,Dadrobit,Never seen it
05-05-2018T15:16:34,BadFoMo,SAO?
05-05-2018T15:16:37,Dadrobit,Both

05-05-2018T15:22:07,Bgrmystr2,easy solution

05-05-2018T15:22:34,Bespin,hehe
05-05-2018T15:22:39,Xexanoth,"just go watch ""Made in Abyss"" to make up for it"

05-05-2018T15:24:06,Xexanoth,"the anime is dark, the manga makes a black hole look bright"
05-05-2018T15:24:06,Bgrmystr2,and difficult to control lol

05-05-2018T16:11:39,CrRAR,Cookies and cream damnnit!
05-05-2018T16:11:44,MuonNeutrino,"hm, yeah, natani would be rather weirded out by the safeguards, true"
05-05-2018T16:11:45,Justanotheruser7118,Nyet
05-05-2018T16:11:46,Bgrmystr2,tis part of reading the chat Terra :V
05-05-2018T16:11:47,CrRAR,next best
05-05-2018T16:11:47,MallardDuckAvia,Who's he drawing now?
05-05-2018T16:11:49,ddeltafox,Store is out of cookie dough ice cream
05-05-2018T16:11:52,ProsePro7,Greetings all
05-05-2018T16:11:56,Xexanoth,@Tharkis it's mostly about AIs
05-05-2018T16:11:57,TerraTheWizard,i had to refresh &gt;:V
05-05-2018T16:11:58,CrimsonHelsing,"I never read Freefall tbh. so Florence is some AI, or... so that'd be a mechanical body? or organic with a construct in the brain or... I b so confussed"
05-05-2018T16:12:06,Bgrmystr2,"Also, that is very emergency Kiwi"
05-05-2018T16:12:12,Xexanoth,"she's organic, but an AI and as such has safeguards"
05-05-2018T16:12:14,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Yay the Florence one finally won!
05-05-2018T16:12:22,Zakuru,technically
05-05-2018T16:12:25,Zakuru,it didnt
05-05-2018T16:12:30,NeonMitsumi,lol
05-05-2018T16:12:30,Xexanoth,tom picked it
05-05-2018T16:12:31,WarToWin,Hello
05-05-2018T16:12:32,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Oh, tom pick then?"
05-05-2018T16:12:40,Vatruvius,Who has been suggesting the Florence one for a while?
05-05-2018T16:12:40,CrimsonHelsing,ahh whoo
05-05-2018T16:12:41,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Sweet
05-05-2018T16:12:44,Justanotheruser7118,I cant stay for long tho ;c
05-05-2018T16:12:45,CanisRufusUK,She's a genericaly engineered animal but classed as an AI and has built in mental safeguards to stop her harming humans
05-05-2018T16:12:45,MuonNeutrino,"florence is a genetically engineered 'uplifted' red wolf, who is legally considered an AI and whose brain is subject to certain engineered 'programmed' safeguards"
05-05-2018T16:12:52,unsteddyphoenix,organic AI
05-05-2018T16:12:58,TorqueEmUp,sweeeeeet
05-05-2018T16:13:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I guess I’ll have to get regular chocolate chip
05-05-2018T16:13:07,CrimsonHelsing,perseverance yields rewards!
05-05-2018T16:13:10,NeonMitsumi,"Florence vs ARA, go"
05-05-2018T16:13:14,MuonNeutrino,"freefall is a VERY VERY VERY good comic, if you haven't read it i cannot suggest it strongly enough"
05-05-2018T16:13:17,Vatruvius,"Drats, that is horrible Kiwi."
05-05-2018T16:13:17,Xexanoth,Ara hands down
05-05-2018T16:13:20,EffKay9,it's sad to call her an AI
05-05-2018T16:13:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"fuse the two, Flara"
05-05-2018T16:13:31,MuonNeutrino,freefall is on par with twokinds for my fav comic
05-05-2018T16:13:34,EffKay9,she doesnt seem a living beaing
05-05-2018T16:13:47,Xexanoth,Muon it's only good if you enjoy discussions about AIs
05-05-2018T16:13:51,Justanotheruser7118,"Personally, i believe everything has its own life..."
05-05-2018T16:13:56,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: Would give my vote to ARA on that, but I highly doubt they would VS anyway. They're not made for combat"
05-05-2018T16:13:57,EffKay9,twokinds crossover with twokind? mhhh cool
05-05-2018T16:13:59,CrimsonHelsing,"So organic body, AI mind, gotcha"
05-05-2018T16:14:00,EffKay9,good idea
05-05-2018T16:14:06,Xexanoth,Ara has an arm laser
05-05-2018T16:14:11,TLDragon,Freefall is very good at balancing the sci fi discussions with humor
05-05-2018T16:14:17,MuonNeutrino,"@Xexanoth well, i happen to enjoy the sorts of philosophical questions mark raises in freefall, so yeah ^^"
05-05-2018T16:14:19,Bgrmystr2,"Does she though, Xex? lol"
05-05-2018T16:14:33,TLDragon,"fine, it's short on fan service. That's... not a big deal, though, is it?"
05-05-2018T16:14:36,CanisRufusUK,"In the comic she's leagaly considered an AI, don;t want to give spoilers but the question ""are AI's people"" is a significant part of the plot"
05-05-2018T16:14:37,TorqueEmUp,"My other idea for Florence, would have been her getting dropped into Mekkan, and her trying to understand the world through logic, but quickly finds out it's a world of magic, not logic. :P"
05-05-2018T16:14:44,EffKay9,give Florence more love boyz XD :P
05-05-2018T16:14:45,MuonNeutrino,"@CrimsonHelsing well, her brain is organic as well. it's just an artificially designed organic brain that has some built in programming"
05-05-2018T16:14:57,CrimsonHelsing,ohhh bioengineering
05-05-2018T16:14:58,Xexanoth,i think there was a pic where she had one
05-05-2018T16:15:02,Xexanoth,lemme see if i can find it
05-05-2018T16:15:05,unsteddyphoenix,i like that idea more lol
05-05-2018T16:15:08,MuonNeutrino,"@CrimsonHelsing yes, exactly"
05-05-2018T16:15:37,Vatruvius,Natani looking happy...for now.
05-05-2018T16:15:41,CrimsonHelsing,"I swear I feel so nerdy with those terms, makes me rather giddy"
05-05-2018T16:15:48,EffKay9,humans are natural intelligence then
05-05-2018T16:15:52,Vatruvius,Unless not boobs is all that matters.
05-05-2018T16:16:11,TorqueEmUp,Natani is like. Woo! no boobs!
05-05-2018T16:16:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Speaking of boobs...
05-05-2018T16:16:18,MuonNeutrino,"@Vatruvius well, if nat hasn't run into the safeguards yet, then 'not boobs' *would* be something he'd be very happy with &gt;.&gt;"
05-05-2018T16:16:18,ItsActuallyKopyKat,yeah lol
05-05-2018T16:16:27,Vatruvius,"Yes, let the boob conversations begin!"

05-05-2018T16:16:42,Bgrmystr2,xD
05-05-2018T16:16:43,ddeltafox,Still havent gotten around to FreeFall. I mostly read Twokinds every update. I got my Girlfriend into it a couple years back and my Best Friend into it a month ago and he is already caught up lol.
05-05-2018T16:16:44,EffKay9,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
05-05-2018T16:17:02,MuonNeutrino,meanwhile florence is all 'PUT MY CLOTHES BACK ON'
05-05-2018T16:17:02,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: aaaaaaa
05-05-2018T16:17:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Had a dream I was a guy once. Only concern I had was “where are my boobs?”
05-05-2018T16:17:08,w0lfmare,Freefall is a good read
05-05-2018T16:17:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Natani has been, UNBOOBED \o/"
05-05-2018T16:17:09,TorqueEmUp,"I wonder if the Safegaurds traveled along to Natani's body, or if Natani now has the safegaurds with Florence's body/brain."
05-05-2018T16:17:09,CanisRufusUK,Freefall is awesome
05-05-2018T16:17:17,Bgrmystr2,xD Yes marv
05-05-2018T16:17:28,unsteddyphoenix,;oooo
05-05-2018T16:17:37,TorqueEmUp,Natani all of a sudden having safegaurds placed in her brain
05-05-2018T16:17:40,Bgrmystr2,"if it's a body swap, then the safeguards stay with the body"
05-05-2018T16:17:41,Vatruvius,Obviously the right concern to have Kiwi.
05-05-2018T16:17:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"It has happen'd, joyous day"
05-05-2018T16:17:48,Bgrmystr2,cuz it's part of the body
05-05-2018T16:17:52,CrRAR,"This science stuff, it's magnificent!"
05-05-2018T16:18:05,ItsActuallyKopyKat,":ctwokinds-KeithNeat: Yesssssss, FINALLY"
05-05-2018T16:18:19,SemiDemiGod,same name?
05-05-2018T16:18:35,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"But: now with the sweet, sweet emotes"
05-05-2018T16:18:37,Justanotheruser7118,Welp brb
05-05-2018T16:18:45,CrRAR,yeah buddy
05-05-2018T16:18:53,MuonNeutrino,and OF COURSE natani takes off poor florence's shirt to celebrate being unboob'd. florence isn't going to like that XD
05-05-2018T16:18:55,Vatruvius,Going up in the world huh Kopy.

05-05-2018T16:19:25,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
05-05-2018T16:19:38,CanisRufusUK,Florence does seem to share Nat's skill of losing her clothes without wanting too.... though not as often as Nat :P
05-05-2018T16:19:46,MuonNeutrino,"a bit, yeah XD"
05-05-2018T16:19:51,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Florence gonna have to deal with natani's excitement lol
05-05-2018T16:19:53,Grishmark,Hello all
05-05-2018T16:19:58,ItsActuallyKopyKat,o/ grish
05-05-2018T16:19:59,CrRAR,hello hello
05-05-2018T16:20:11,Vatruvius,It is as if there is this external force causing Nat to lose his clothes on a regular basis.
05-05-2018T16:20:15,Vatruvius,:thinking:

05-05-2018T16:20:54,MuonNeutrino,i was supposed to go for a run but now i can't leave while this is being drawn heh
05-05-2018T16:21:05,Justanotheruser7118,Same here lol
05-05-2018T16:21:20,Vatruvius,"So Natani might like not having boobs, but how would Keith feel?"
05-05-2018T16:21:26,Vatruvius,:ptv-shock:
05-05-2018T16:21:41,NeonMitsumi,Same?
05-05-2018T16:21:48,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Keith might be a little shocked, but i'm sure he will support her newfound weight loss"
05-05-2018T16:21:50,Vatruvius,Back to the friend zone.
05-05-2018T16:21:52,MuonNeutrino,i think keith would be alright with it
05-05-2018T16:21:53,ItsActuallyKopyKat,OH
05-05-2018T16:21:58,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Damn, vatru"
05-05-2018T16:21:59,MuonNeutrino,"he loves natani for who nat is, not for his body"
05-05-2018T16:22:02,ItsActuallyKopyKat,^
05-05-2018T16:22:03,TorqueEmUp,"Well Nat would still have a butt, and all the other bits and pieces."
05-05-2018T16:22:12,CrRAR,lol
05-05-2018T16:22:13,ItsActuallyKopyKat,:V
05-05-2018T16:22:14,TorqueEmUp,Just no jubblies
05-05-2018T16:22:29,TorqueEmUp,He'll cope fine
05-05-2018T16:22:31,TorqueEmUp,:P
05-05-2018T16:22:38,ItsActuallyKopyKat,I mean... Nat would still have the double rows on her belly?
05-05-2018T16:22:38,Vatruvius,"Maybe, but than Natani has nothing to tease Keith with in private."
05-05-2018T16:22:38,CrRAR,Still has butt [✓]
05-05-2018T16:22:45,MuonNeutrino,"actually there's another thing natani would appreciate about being in florence's body, apart form the 'no boobs' thing - only going into heat once every 10 years instead of twice a year XD"
05-05-2018T16:22:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,de biity
05-05-2018T16:22:55,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"That too, Muon"
05-05-2018T16:22:56,CanisRufusUK,The direct order thing and inability to harm humans might cause problems for an assasin
05-05-2018T16:23:00,TorqueEmUp,Oh she would still have plenty to tease Keith with in private
05-05-2018T16:23:24,TorqueEmUp,"Ooof, that is true, no more assassinations"
05-05-2018T16:23:32,MuonNeutrino,"natani, natani... put florence's shirt back on before she has to hurt you. don't forget SHE'S the one in the bigger, stronger body now XD"
05-05-2018T16:23:34,TorqueEmUp,Not that they were all that good at it in the first place.
05-05-2018T16:23:38,unsteddyphoenix,nothing has changed really
05-05-2018T16:23:40,Dadrobit,Back in for a hot second.
05-05-2018T16:23:43,Dadrobit,Florence?
05-05-2018T16:23:45,WereKeidran,is this the freefall body swap?
05-05-2018T16:23:45,ItsActuallyKopyKat,hey hey dad
05-05-2018T16:23:47,TorqueEmUp,Yop
05-05-2018T16:23:47,BadFoMo,Yep.
05-05-2018T16:23:48,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Yes
05-05-2018T16:23:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Wb Father
05-05-2018T16:23:57,unsteddyphoenix,actually its better now she has an excuse!
05-05-2018T16:23:59,CrimsonHelsing,really? bioengineered with the three laws of robotics?
05-05-2018T16:24:09,TorqueEmUp,Pretty much
05-05-2018T16:24:10,Njasey,(think natani is going to wonder when the censor bars appear ;)
05-05-2018T16:24:13,Dadrobit,"Hey, Tom. Where are the panels of obfuscation?"
05-05-2018T16:24:18,TorqueEmUp,You should give Freefall a read if you haven't
05-05-2018T16:24:18,Justanotheruser7118,Heh
05-05-2018T16:24:19,CanisRufusUK,"Not the three laws specificaly, but safeguards to that effect"
05-05-2018T16:24:26,MuonNeutrino,"@CrimsonHelsing not 3 laws specifically, but AIs in the freefall universe are built with 'safeguards' that prevent them from intentionally harming a human"
05-05-2018T16:24:26,CrimsonHelsing,ahh
05-05-2018T16:24:34,unsteddyphoenix,true! incredibly lewd atm
05-05-2018T16:24:42,Dadrobit,Some serious censor bars are needed here for a proper crossover!
05-05-2018T16:24:53,CanisRufusUK,Helix vision
05-05-2018T16:24:54,Vatruvius,Never lewd unless there is ankle.
05-05-2018T16:24:55,TorqueEmUp,"Also Florence finds her own species ""weird looking"""
05-05-2018T16:24:59,Bgrmystr2,xD
05-05-2018T16:25:02,MuonNeutrino,florence has interesting perspectives on her safeguards
05-05-2018T16:25:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Censor them
05-05-2018T16:25:15,unsteddyphoenix,Freefall actually has a theorised example of why the three laws dont work
05-05-2018T16:25:18,TrueZealand,nice and tasteful without the ankles
05-05-2018T16:25:18,Bgrmystr2,xD
05-05-2018T16:25:18,Vatruvius,Censor the ankles!
05-05-2018T16:25:20,Justanotheruser7118,Use the pg vision
05-05-2018T16:25:21,CrimsonHelsing,seriously? xD she's around humans a bit too much in that case xD
05-05-2018T16:25:42,TorqueEmUp,No that's how her mind was engineered
05-05-2018T16:25:42,unsteddyphoenix,"I studied AI and ran across the saame example, so it eas funny to see it in a comic"
05-05-2018T16:25:48,MuonNeutrino,"@CrimsonHelsing part of the backstory is that there are only a dozen or so of her species in existence, they were prototypes for the genetic engineering project"
05-05-2018T16:25:54,TorqueEmUp,it's a byproduct of being more compatible with humans.
05-05-2018T16:25:57,Dadrobit,Were't the three laws originally created just to demonstrate how you really cannot properly shackle an AI?
05-05-2018T16:26:00,MuonNeutrino,@CrimsonHelsing florence has never actually met one of her own species in person
05-05-2018T16:26:12,CrimsonHelsing,"yep, around too many humans xD"
05-05-2018T16:26:14,MviluUatusun,Okay.  I'm back.  I'm now fully protected.
05-05-2018T16:26:15,CanisRufusUK,"Her spiecies is a proof of concept, there are only 14  (or 12? something like that) of them. She was raised by humans"
05-05-2018T16:26:18,unsteddyphoenix,yeah pretty much
05-05-2018T16:26:31,unsteddyphoenix,it doesnt even work in the book it was conceived in
05-05-2018T16:26:33,MuonNeutrino,@CrimsonHelsing she was actually raised by a human family who originally didn't know she was anything more than a smarter-than-average dog
05-05-2018T16:26:48,MviluUatusun,"Yes.  You're right, Canis.  Although she did meet her creator."
05-05-2018T16:26:54,CanisRufusUK,untill she started talking
05-05-2018T16:26:58,MuonNeutrino,"(like keidran, she looked like a regular animal as an infant)"
05-05-2018T16:27:05,TorqueEmUp,"But it is explained somewhat it's due to how her mind was engineered, not just because she has only been around humans."
05-05-2018T16:27:17,MuonNeutrino,"@TorqueEmUp yep, but not being around her own species doesn't help either XD"
05-05-2018T16:27:19,CrimsonHelsing,that makes sense Muon
05-05-2018T16:27:20,Bgrmystr2,xD Florence is gonna have somethin to say about that
05-05-2018T16:27:20,Xexanoth,"Asimov was all about being clever with stuff, half his storys are the three laws causing a ton of troubles"
05-05-2018T16:27:36,Dadrobit,Okie dokie. Back to socializing!
05-05-2018T16:27:42,MuonNeutrino,"@Bgrmystr2 yup. ""PUT MY SHIRT BACK ON OR SO HELP ME GOD!"""
05-05-2018T16:27:45,BadFoMo,Bye.
05-05-2018T16:27:51,TorqueEmUp,"True Muon, but if she was attracted to her own speices, it wouldn't be through physical attraction."
05-05-2018T16:28:02,Dadrobit,"(Seriously though, I'd love to see the panels of obfuscation make a comeback.)"
05-05-2018T16:28:03,CanisRufusUK,The point of several of asimov's stories is that the three laws don't always work
05-05-2018T16:28:34,CrimsonHelsing,"agreed Xexanoth, I read the original ""I, Robot"""
05-05-2018T16:28:34,MviluUatusun,"That's true, Canis.  In"
05-05-2018T16:28:42,MuonNeutrino,"@TorqueEmUp i doubt bowman suppressed *all* of her instincts that way, though it's an interesting question. that's a SUPER deep rooted instinct, i'd imagine it'd take a lot of doing to erase it"
05-05-2018T16:28:42,CrRAR,Yeah that interpretation is an important factor.

05-05-2018T18:54:08,unsteddyphoenix,I wonder if that could happen actually. Some sort of insular community where a mistake is never corrected...

05-05-2018T20:53:03,Bgrmystr2,yeah Picarto supports way more than just the icons it allows us to click on
05-05-2018T20:53:28,Bgrmystr2,"phone icons and other stuff are all supported to, but not shown to users who aren't on that device"

05-05-2018T20:54:20,Twokinds,I'm just not so keen on the suggestion.
05-05-2018T20:54:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,rip wee little t-rex emote
05-05-2018T20:54:38,BadFoMo,But you said it was ok.
05-05-2018T20:54:43,KiTA,What was the suggestion?
05-05-2018T20:54:58,Twokinds,Which one?
05-05-2018T20:55:23,BadFoMo,Maeve buries Keith and Natani at the beach and fashion Merfolk tails for them while Maddie and Karen build Sandcastle forts.
05-05-2018T20:55:36,Twokinds,"Oh, that's fine."
05-05-2018T20:55:42,BadFoMo,I changed it as requested.
05-05-2018T20:55:58,MarcusJohnson,May- ve
05-05-2018T20:55:58,Twokinds,"Oh, I download the requests before the stream."
05-05-2018T20:55:58,Bgrmystr2,"Which one was it that you didn't like, Tom :o"
05-05-2018T20:56:04,Twokinds,It doesn't update the local copy.
05-05-2018T20:56:46,unsteddyphoenix,There was probably more than one
05-05-2018T20:56:50,Twokinds,I thoguht the original version of that suggestions was fine too.
05-05-2018T20:57:06,Twokinds,"I can do two panels, if there's not five characters or whatever."
05-05-2018T20:57:39,BadFoMo,@Twokinds I decided to split it into 2 requests.
05-05-2018T20:58:45,BadFoMo,@Bgrmystr2 The one we were talking about was 'A heavily pregnant Flora takes bandages similarly enchanted to the ones that Natani uses to put her belly on someone else.'
05-05-2018T20:59:04,Bgrmystr2,oooh that one
05-05-2018T20:59:11,Dadrobit,That's.... weird.
05-05-2018T20:59:16,Twokinds,"Yeah no, not that one."
05-05-2018T20:59:25,unsteddyphoenix,And it doesnt really make sense. :thinking:
05-05-2018T20:59:46,unsteddyphoenix,The colours would still be floras
05-05-2018T20:59:56,unsteddyphoenix,So it'd look like some frankenstein abomination
05-05-2018T21:00:21,Twokinds,That's not what I was talking about.
05-05-2018T21:01:41,Bgrmystr2,"Well, It's not like the flora w/ natani's boobs did that, phoenix. Cuz shirt."

05-05-2018T21:04:06,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s taking your glasses off at the end of the day and then there’s taking your boobs off
05-05-2018T21:04:26,Ordithus,And then there's taking your pregnancy off :ptv-confused:
05-05-2018T21:04:29,Bgrmystr2,Imgur has been more and more shit with loading lol

05-05-2018T21:09:31,BadFoMo,"@Twokinds I'm sorry, but I would like to test something. Logic says that this would be snubbed; 'Trading Halves Sequel. Flora and Trace finding out that they're going to be parents! (Natani and Keith's reaction to the news somewhere in the background?'?"
05-05-2018T21:11:42,unsteddyphoenix,...?

05-05-2018T21:20:28,Dadrobit,I think he was talking to Elven.

05-05-2018T22:53:26,Dadrobit,Pretty solid
05-05-2018T22:53:39,Dadrobit,7/10 on the buttclench scale.

05-05-2018T22:57:07,Twokinds,"Yeah, I remember enjoying that one."

05-05-2018T22:57:31,TheBeckoner,together*
05-05-2018T22:57:43,Ordithus,I saw Infinity War today
05-05-2018T22:59:36,Ordithus,I am torn on it.
05-05-2018T22:59:54,Dadrobit,I thought it was great imo. Loved the ending.
05-05-2018T23:00:14,Dadrobit,But I think that's kind of a sticking point for a lot of people.
05-05-2018T23:00:28,Ordithus,10/10 execution... but it makes me feel disgusted
05-05-2018T23:04:01,Vatruvius,Hey guys!
05-05-2018T23:05:08,Ordithus,yo
05-05-2018T23:05:28,Dadrobit,wb
05-05-2018T23:06:23,Vatruvius,"Tom, did you know your brother is eating a ghost pepper ever day and singing all of his 35,000 calendars by Thursday?"
05-05-2018T23:06:52,Ordithus,That's a lot of singing.
05-05-2018T23:07:07,Bgrmystr2,Indeed
05-05-2018T23:07:08,Vatruvius,lol...signing.
05-05-2018T23:07:11,Bgrmystr2,hope his throat lasts.
05-05-2018T23:08:10,Vatruvius,"From his recent video, Ghost Pepper: DAY 1, I think you got the better gig Tom."
05-05-2018T23:08:45,Vatruvius,You get to draw sexy anthro/furry characters every day or almost every day without ghost peppers.
05-05-2018T23:10:43,Vatruvius,I also think it is because of things Mark does like in that video that your mom is not surprised by your content.
05-05-2018T23:10:59,Vatruvius,Seems healthier.
05-05-2018T23:12:03,Dadrobit,Tom is completely wholesome. I dunno how anyone could see it otherwise.
05-05-2018T23:13:46,Ordithus,":ctwokinds-KatDance: I know, right?"
05-05-2018T23:14:05,Vatruvius,"I am not saying he is not wholesome. But if I had a sibling like Mark who posted videos like that Ghost Pepper: DAY 1 video, explaining to my parents I like furrys would be easier. Not that what Mark does is bad, still a sub."
05-05-2018T23:14:19,Vatruvius,Nothing but whole butts here.
05-05-2018T23:14:32,Twokinds,I want to try a ghost pepper...
05-05-2018T23:15:12,Dadrobit,They're pretty spicy. Not gonna lie. Hurts like Hell the next day.
05-05-2018T23:15:28,Twokinds,I have ghost pepper hot sauce
05-05-2018T23:15:34,Twokinds,But I've never had the pepper itself.
05-05-2018T23:15:39,Dadrobit,Local wing shop makes insane sauce with them. I love cooking with it.
05-05-2018T23:15:45,Vatruvius,"I mean, it got your brother to cry ""I will be a good boy"" to millions live so..."
05-05-2018T23:15:54,Twokinds,I didn't care for the taste. I prefer plain old Redhot.
05-05-2018T23:16:10,Vatruvius,"Not sure if that is a rating, like a Mark Spice-o-Meter"
05-05-2018T23:16:15,Ordithus,Does it taste like pain?
05-05-2018T23:16:45,Twokinds,"Eh, it wasn't that bad, actually. I'm wondering if it really was ghost pepper sauce."
05-05-2018T23:16:57,Dadrobit,"Alternative spicy sauce for me is either Red Devil, Dave's Insane,or good old fashioned Tobasco."
05-05-2018T23:17:23,Vatruvius,I am not a spice guy so you guys enjoy I will pass on it.
05-05-2018T23:17:36,Dadrobit,You'll know if it's real. It hurts the fingers just to touch it.
05-05-2018T23:17:46,Ordithus,"I enjoy spicy food, but I have limits"
05-05-2018T23:17:51,Twokinds,"Nah, this stuff didn't. It must have been pretty diluted."
05-05-2018T23:17:54,Ordithus,"Once it hurts, that's too much"
05-05-2018T23:18:06,Dadrobit,Though Taco Bell did an admirable job at recreating the taste of it a few years back.
05-05-2018T23:18:29,Dadrobit,"Not nearly as spicy, but still had the flavor."

05-05-2018T23:48:56,Vatruvius,Or store made cookies or something.
05-05-2018T23:50:03,Vatruvius,"That reminds of a movie day I had in middle school. Our school was small so the 6th, 7th, and 8th grades were all one class, technically two. I baked a lot chocolate chip cookies and brought them but every ate the store made crap...more cookies for me."
05-05-2018T23:50:23,Vatruvius,everyone*
05-05-2018T23:51:33,Dadrobit,I know one of the students is supposed to bring some home made cookies.

05-05-2018T23:58:46,Vatruvius,"Tom, you need to sell cooking aprons like the one Kat wears. I would buy that."
05-05-2018T23:58:48,unsteddyphoenix,that could mean one of two things...
05-05-2018T23:59:07,Twokinds,But it's just a pink apron with a heart on it
05-05-2018T23:59:19,Twokinds,"I should sell it with a Kat daki, so you can remove the apron."
05-05-2018T23:59:25,Vatruvius,"I believe there is a white one too, no?"
05-05-2018T23:59:39,unsteddyphoenix,Can you sell it so the heart is half-way drooping off?
