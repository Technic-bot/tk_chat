09-05-2018T09:50:52,SiliconCarbide,it was great
09-05-2018T09:56:10,NickTheName,"Yes, one of my favorite series (except Season 9)"
09-05-2018T09:59:38,SiliconCarbide,oh yeah season 9 sucked
09-05-2018T09:59:45,SiliconCarbide,obviously season 8 was intended to end the show
09-05-2018T10:00:31,SiliconCarbide,dunno why they still shot season 9
09-05-2018T10:02:54,NickTheName,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
09-05-2018T10:02:56,NickTheName,Money?

09-05-2018T13:05:23,Vatruvius,Heyo! :ptv-greetings:
09-05-2018T13:06:33,NickTheName,Heylo!
09-05-2018T14:52:49,Vatruvius,"Where is Tom, his brother has all but died on the internet!"
09-05-2018T15:16:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom’s probably carrying on with life as usual
09-05-2018T15:17:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"Not Mark’s first breakdown, won’t be the last"
09-05-2018T15:17:05,NickTheName,"What is this ""life"""
09-05-2018T15:17:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, we found another kitten"
09-05-2018T15:22:55,Vatruvius,"I mean, did you see Mark's latest video...""exiled."""
09-05-2018T15:23:01,Vatruvius,Another kitten!?
09-05-2018T15:23:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I know of the video and yes another kitten
09-05-2018T15:24:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Sister has a coworker that found him on the roadside on the way to work
09-05-2018T15:24:53,Vatruvius,Nooo!
09-05-2018T15:25:04,Vatruvius,Save the kitty from the road!
09-05-2018T15:28:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Kitty passed out in box
09-05-2018T15:29:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Not hungry yet apparently but he got along ok with Jellybean
09-05-2018T15:30:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera was desperately confused as to how the kitten went from black to orange tabby
09-05-2018T15:31:31,SpazztasticKiwi,He gave the new kitten a slow boop on the noggin like “how’d you change colors like that?”
09-05-2018T15:35:00,Vatruvius,lol
09-05-2018T15:35:28,Vatruvius,What until Bagheera finds out they actually have two new kittens...oh boy.
09-05-2018T15:35:40,Vatruvius,Is Bagheera male or female?
09-05-2018T15:36:22,SpazztasticKiwi,He a little boy
09-05-2018T15:37:03,SpazztasticKiwi,And so are both kittens
09-05-2018T16:43:59,DRAGONTANOPUG,Through the power of my sister having to go to utah for dance compititions ! I am here a day early!
09-05-2018T16:45:04,DRAGONTANOPUG,Picarto updated a lot.
09-05-2018T16:45:35,Bgrmystr2,more like downgraded
09-05-2018T16:46:14,DRAGONTANOPUG,Whats wrong?
09-05-2018T16:46:43,Bgrmystr2,a whole lot lol. Not that I expect them to fix any of it
09-05-2018T16:47:05,DRAGONTANOPUG,I see nothing wrong with what i intend to do.
09-05-2018T16:47:33,Bgrmystr2,course not. Easy to only look at what you want in particular
09-05-2018T17:21:09,Vatruvius,"You have to admit, they fixed some issues Bgr. As for the window being slightly smaller, it is almost indistinguishable for me."
09-05-2018T17:21:35,Bgrmystr2,"""slightly"" Probably because of your resolution"
09-05-2018T17:22:20,Bgrmystr2,"Also, the only thing I know of that they ""fixed"" was stuff with the mobile app which has nothing to do with the site design"
09-05-2018T17:22:37,Bgrmystr2,so.. I don't really have anything to admit
09-05-2018T17:22:41,Bgrmystr2,:u
09-05-2018T17:27:21,DRAGONTANOPUG,Aha the app
09-05-2018T17:59:38,Vatruvius,"Well, they removed the character counter which had an annoying effect with the chat and they stopped the ""Videos"" tab from notifying us that Tom has videos every 12 seconds."
09-05-2018T18:13:29,Bgrmystr2,"that was only something that happened because of the change though, not something that needed to be fixed to begin with"
09-05-2018T18:14:08,Bgrmystr2,that didn't happen before they changed the site design
09-05-2018T18:20:42,Vatruvius,"That was a part of the change, since then they have made minor updates to it based off of user emails and complaints."
09-05-2018T18:30:55,Bgrmystr2,you can only assume that though. Who knows if they're even listening to what users are saying. The video / chat counter was something even they would have seen.
09-05-2018T18:31:44,Bgrmystr2,They make changes and fix bugs those changes caused. It's only natural
09-05-2018T18:39:37,Vatruvius,"Either way, they fixed some things that came with the new update. That is all I am trying to say."
09-05-2018T18:43:45,Bgrmystr2,Yeh I get that. I'm just sayin none of that would have been necessary if they didn't do the update in the first place
09-05-2018T18:44:05,Bgrmystr2,none of it would have broken :u
09-05-2018T18:44:24,Bgrmystr2,But I guess they gonna do what they wanna do
09-05-2018T20:50:25,DRAGONTANOPUG,I cant get a win in fortnite
