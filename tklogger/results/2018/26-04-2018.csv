26-04-2018T00:30:30,NightMeaty22,goes back to the dark corner and sits in his box
26-04-2018T00:37:15,Vatruvius,"Hey Meaty, not in the mood to talk but thought I should say hello back."
26-04-2018T03:30:44,TheAvalon,Hello?

26-04-2018T12:10:21,ZergsHive,from Russia
26-04-2018T15:03:02,ShAdOw9,Im from Germany :3
26-04-2018T15:18:13,SilliconCarbide,well hello there fellow german soul
26-04-2018T15:46:01,JaydenMozingo,"Tom, rather you're there or not, you need to know that you made my day when I got home and saw Bikini Clovis"
26-04-2018T15:52:48,CrimsonFall,same
26-04-2018T16:40:16,DRAGONTANOPUG,And.... Im back.
26-04-2018T16:40:31,DRAGONTANOPUG,Short week.
26-04-2018T16:46:45,DRAGONTANOPUG,Which sketch hot colored for April?
26-04-2018T16:46:54,DRAGONTANOPUG,Got*
26-04-2018T17:22:36,UnknownEnd,...
26-04-2018T17:22:42,UnknownEnd,YES
26-04-2018T17:25:11,CrRAR,YES?
26-04-2018T17:29:17,DRAGONTANOPUG,?
26-04-2018T17:30:49,CrRAR,¿
26-04-2018T17:32:16,Bgrmystr2,SƎ⅄
26-04-2018T17:35:02,DRAGONTANOPUG,Which sketch got colored for april?
26-04-2018T17:44:59,Bgrmystr2,check the patreon to see if he posted any nora cards :u
26-04-2018T17:55:04,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Again, im not a patreon. If i ask my mom for her credit card shes going too ask ""to buy what"" two weeks ago she said ""Im not going to spend any money on Twokinds, cause why would YOU support somthing like that"" and after explaining so much too her dout"
26-04-2018T17:55:10,DRAGONTANOPUG,She will any way
26-04-2018T18:01:44,NightMeaty22,Hello
26-04-2018T18:01:47,totallynotTrace,you can view a majority of his work on patreon for free
26-04-2018T18:02:01,Bgrmystr2,"Again, irrelevant. Noone has to pay for artwork on the patreon besides the side comic."
26-04-2018T18:02:13,Bgrmystr2,and the side comics are not what you're asking about
26-04-2018T18:02:20,DRAGONTANOPUG,Hello nightmeaty
26-04-2018T18:02:21,totallynotTrace,exactly
26-04-2018T18:02:30,DRAGONTANOPUG,Ok then
26-04-2018T18:02:59,totallynotTrace,I forget if you have to login to view but either way a patreon account is free
26-04-2018T18:03:05,Bgrmystr2,you don't have to
26-04-2018T18:03:14,Bgrmystr2,I can see it and I don't have a patreon account
26-04-2018T18:03:19,DRAGONTANOPUG,Oh an account
26-04-2018T18:07:33,DRAGONTANOPUG,Still habe to pay the 10 bucks tho
26-04-2018T18:07:38,DRAGONTANOPUG,Have*
26-04-2018T18:07:53,totallynotTrace,$10 for what?
26-04-2018T18:08:44,DRAGONTANOPUG,To veiw the april color poll
26-04-2018T18:09:07,totallynotTrace,"also from what I can tell the last Nora card was ""Tail Nap"" posted april 2"
26-04-2018T18:09:24,totallynotTrace,i didnt even know of the april poll
26-04-2018T18:13:52,DRAGONTANOPUG,If I pledge to Tom while I also have access to side comics like the dragon masquerade?
26-04-2018T18:14:31,DRAGONTANOPUG,Will not while
26-04-2018T18:15:29,DRAGONTANOPUG,Oh wait if i buy it now in three days it will renew....... NVM
26-04-2018T18:19:48,totallynotTrace,I think so but not sure exactly what amoount unlocks it
26-04-2018T18:20:08,totallynotTrace,oh
26-04-2018T18:20:11,totallynotTrace,found it
26-04-2018T18:20:43,totallynotTrace,$5 and up unlocks side comics
26-04-2018T18:21:09,totallynotTrace,or thats what it looks like
26-04-2018T18:21:39,Bgrmystr2,the poll is only for people voting on the color images
26-04-2018T18:21:44,Bgrmystr2,and it's only for patrons
26-04-2018T18:21:50,Bgrmystr2,it hasn't finished yet
26-04-2018T18:21:56,Bgrmystr2,that's this sunday
26-04-2018T18:22:30,Bgrmystr2,"he hasn't done any coloring of the stream sketches, cuz that stream hasn't happened yet lol"
26-04-2018T18:22:34,DRAGONTANOPUG,Oh yaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
26-04-2018T18:22:39,Bgrmystr2,"always the last sunday in the month, bro"
26-04-2018T18:22:51,Bgrmystr2,pay attention to the calandar
26-04-2018T18:23:19,Bgrmystr2,"when he finishes the colors, he's gonna post em to patreon and anyone can see the posts anyway"
26-04-2018T18:23:34,Bgrmystr2,so it's pretty irrelevant unless you specifically want to be able to vote for the color
26-04-2018T18:24:04,DRAGONTANOPUG,Now i feel dumb
26-04-2018T18:24:37,Bgrmystr2,seems like a common thing :thinking:
26-04-2018T18:25:33,totallynotTrace,ive only been here for about a month so i dont know how everything works. good to know
26-04-2018T18:26:05,Vatruvius,How are things going pre-stream?
26-04-2018T18:26:26,Vatruvius,"Also, hello people! :ptv-greetings:"
26-04-2018T18:26:30,DRAGONTANOPUG,Hi
26-04-2018T18:29:32,totallynotTrace,hey
26-04-2018T18:29:49,totallynotTrace,seems to be goin well
26-04-2018T18:35:18,DRAGONTANOPUG,You know what's funny two weeks ago I was made fun of for the 10th anniversary chapter cover page as my home screen cuz I had furries on it and that guy who made fun of me read the comic in a week.
26-04-2018T18:35:27,DRAGONTANOPUG,So i made fun of him
26-04-2018T18:35:54,totallynotTrace,pffffft amature

26-04-2018T18:36:35,DRAGONTANOPUG,Car ride
26-04-2018T18:36:45,totallynotTrace,you read fast
26-04-2018T18:37:06,DRAGONTANOPUG,About 500 or 600 wpm
26-04-2018T18:38:25,totallynotTrace,do you even have time to look at the art at that point? thats what took up about half the time for me was just looking
26-04-2018T18:39:26,Bgrmystr2,probably not
26-04-2018T18:39:42,DRAGONTANOPUG,The first time i read it was about 3 days but then i tried yo speed read it.
26-04-2018T18:42:59,totallynotTrace,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/765/ was this you wallpaper Tan?
26-04-2018T18:43:10,totallynotTrace,*your
26-04-2018T18:44:07,Vatruvius,Took me 8 hours to read the comic the first time. I binged it in one night.
26-04-2018T18:44:25,DRAGONTANOPUG,Yea but i change after he screamed he watchs henti on his tablet!!!
26-04-2018T18:44:56,totallynotTrace,ah
26-04-2018T18:45:35,totallynotTrace,im gunna guess you're younger than college age?
26-04-2018T18:45:54,Bgrmystr2,"lol very much so, he is"
26-04-2018T18:46:08,DRAGONTANOPUG,13
26-04-2018T18:46:24,Vatruvius,lol...far from college age.
26-04-2018T18:46:34,totallynotTrace,funny thing actually
26-04-2018T18:46:46,DRAGONTANOPUG,Sorta
26-04-2018T18:46:59,totallynotTrace,I had an 11 year old in my freshman grade class
26-04-2018T18:47:07,totallynotTrace,thats what was funny
26-04-2018T18:47:14,totallynotTrace,not Tans age
26-04-2018T18:47:21,Vatruvius,Hmm...that brilliant huh?
26-04-2018T18:47:52,totallynotTrace,basically I go to community college
26-04-2018T18:48:07,totallynotTrace,so we get a lot of homeschoolers
26-04-2018T18:48:18,totallynotTrace,actually he was in 2 of my classes
26-04-2018T18:48:32,Vatruvius,Hmm...
26-04-2018T18:49:49,Vatruvius,Expecting another page stream today yes?
26-04-2018T18:50:04,totallynotTrace,but anyway what I was originally going to say is Ive seen some much more embarasing things in college. like... just saying someone watches hentia makes it sound like conventional
26-04-2018T18:50:49,totallynotTrace,i hope its a page stream
26-04-2018T18:51:53,totallynotTrace,also people dont really make fun of you for commic related stuff from my experience after highschool
26-04-2018T18:52:31,Vatruvius,"Yeah, it is not that bad compared to what happens in college. Still, not tge healthiest pastime."
26-04-2018T18:52:45,Vatruvius,the*
26-04-2018T18:53:22,DRAGONTANOPUG,I redid my math
26-04-2018T18:53:31,DRAGONTANOPUG,The comic will end in 2024
26-04-2018T18:53:46,totallynotTrace,or will it end?
26-04-2018T18:54:12,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Around 2024, before it was 2951"
26-04-2018T18:54:15,CrimsonFall,"every time I went to the student lounge, people be playing uno"
26-04-2018T18:54:41,totallynotTrace,mean hentai is not the healthiest past time or commics?
26-04-2018T18:54:53,Vatruvius,Trying to determine will it will end makes no sense as we do not know how much more of tge story Tom is still has planned.
26-04-2018T18:54:59,totallynotTrace,we have a D&D club
26-04-2018T18:55:12,CrimsonFall,oh
26-04-2018T18:55:25,CrimsonFall,new season came out
26-04-2018T18:55:27,DRAGONTANOPUG,We have magic the gathering club
26-04-2018T18:55:37,Vatruvius,I mean any type of pornography is not a healthy pastime.
26-04-2018T18:55:58,Bgrmystr2,"Would disagree, Vatru."
26-04-2018T18:56:05,Bgrmystr2,Plenty of artists make a living creating adult art.
26-04-2018T18:56:05,DRAGONTANOPUG,I wouldent count tk as porn
26-04-2018T18:56:23,Bgrmystr2,"also, there's nothing unhealthy about it."
26-04-2018T18:56:55,Vatruvius,"Well, we jnow what you do with your pastime Bgr."
26-04-2018T18:57:03,DRAGONTANOPUG,Lol
26-04-2018T18:57:13,Vatruvius,TK is definitely not porn.
26-04-2018T18:57:15,totallynotTrace,"we also have a general gaming club (covers everything from cards, boards, casual d&d, and video games. then we have a more serious d&d club"
26-04-2018T18:57:22,Bgrmystr2,"Lol vatru, confirmed prude?"
26-04-2018T18:57:24,Bgrmystr2,:V
26-04-2018T18:57:34,totallynotTrace,I would not consider TK porn at all
26-04-2018T18:57:48,Bgrmystr2,attacking me personally for making a statement based on humanity as a whole is tactless.
26-04-2018T18:57:57,DRAGONTANOPUG,I brought my fuckin Atari to school today for no reason...
26-04-2018T18:58:11,Vatruvius,I was not attacking you...
26-04-2018T18:58:52,DRAGONTANOPUG,Im a very attackable person.
26-04-2018T18:58:57,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: Oh, okay. I'll just ignore the very blatant statement you made earlier then?"
26-04-2018T18:59:11,Bgrmystr2,:thumbsup:
26-04-2018T18:59:53,totallynotTrace,ill just drop this here as the definition of pornography
26-04-2018T19:00:02,totallynotTrace,provided by google
26-04-2018T19:00:04,totallynotTrace,"printed or visual material containing the explicit description or display of sexual organs or activity, intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings."
26-04-2018T19:00:05,Vatruvius,"Well, I certainly was not making a blantant statement about humanity and your opinion on the matter clears indicates some personal experience."
26-04-2018T19:00:30,Vatruvius,clearly*
26-04-2018T19:00:41,DRAGONTANOPUG,I was reading the comic earlier this week and I realize that raine had a cross necklace so does that mean there is a religion called Christianity
26-04-2018T19:01:09,Vatruvius,I doubt it Tano
26-04-2018T19:01:41,Vatruvius,And can you link the page where you saw this necklace?
26-04-2018T19:01:53,Bgrmystr2,"I don't think you understand the context of what you implied, vatru. Unfortunate that you cannot differenciate science from societal pressure."
26-04-2018T19:02:36,Bgrmystr2,Would recommend looking up the science of why adult things are normal and healthy for human society as a whole.
26-04-2018T19:03:19,Xexanoth,when you just come into chat to post a cool tiger vid but people are fighting about porn :ptv-unimpressed:
26-04-2018T19:03:26,Bgrmystr2,xD hey Xex
26-04-2018T19:03:38,Bgrmystr2,it's not a fight
26-04-2018T19:03:44,Xexanoth,"also,  here's a nice short vid you might enjoy https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/comments/8f5u07/slow_motion_tiger_jump_from_animal_planet/"
26-04-2018T19:04:08,DRAGONTANOPUG,Ummmm.. url lookin sketchy
26-04-2018T19:04:08,totallynotTrace,have we seen male genitalia? no. Nipples? no. Does it have steamy moments? sure. However it emphasizes aesthetic and has a very important emotional story (if you need an example just look to the bridge scene on the basatin island)
26-04-2018T19:04:10,Vatruvius,Unfortunate? I was stated my opinion in the matter Bgr. I most certainly understand how life is and tge desire for such content. But from both personal experience and seeing what pornography has done to friends of mine I have formed the opinion that it is
26-04-2018T19:04:23,Vatruvius,an unhealthy pastime.
26-04-2018T19:04:35,Xexanoth,"how is ""reddit"" looking sketchy?"
26-04-2018T19:05:03,Xexanoth,it's one of the biggest sites on the net
26-04-2018T19:05:11,Bgrmystr2,"Yup. Unfortunate. I am not stating opinions. If you would like me to state my opinion, I can, but I did not, because it has no relevance. Putting forth yours is just bad taste."
26-04-2018T19:05:11,Vatruvius,Reddit is not a sketchy site Tano.
26-04-2018T19:05:13,DRAGONTANOPUG,Ders a bad werd in it
26-04-2018T19:05:39,CrimsonFall,"oh i see, this jumping technic is what flora use on trace all the time"
26-04-2018T19:06:04,totallynotTrace,I cant stop laughing at the end of the toes jigling
26-04-2018T19:06:08,Bgrmystr2,"Also, less floof than I thought, xex"
26-04-2018T19:06:24,Vatruvius,How was saying pornography being healthy not your opinion Bgr?
26-04-2018T19:06:49,Bgrmystr2,"because it's not? It's a science, vatru."
26-04-2018T19:07:01,CrimsonFall,he could have known it to be a fact
26-04-2018T19:07:12,DRAGONTANOPUG,An hour left....yawn
26-04-2018T19:07:29,Vatruvius,So you are an expert in the effects of pornagraphy on society Bgr?
26-04-2018T19:07:35,Bgrmystr2,Facts are not the same as opinions. They are different.
26-04-2018T19:07:39,totallynotTrace,general consensus in the scientific community on porn is a mixed bag
26-04-2018T19:07:46,Xexanoth,^
26-04-2018T19:08:15,Xexanoth,"like all things, it depends on how much you use it"
26-04-2018T19:08:21,Bgrmystr2,"I never said that, so no. But it's good as a whole. If you removed it completely, it would be problematic."
26-04-2018T19:08:26,Vatruvius,I would agree with you there notTrace.
26-04-2018T19:08:28,totallynotTrace,absolutely agree with xex
26-04-2018T19:08:30,Xexanoth,it's the difference between enjoying alcohol and being and alcoholic
26-04-2018T19:08:43,Bgrmystr2,"exactly, xex."
26-04-2018T19:09:10,Xexanoth,"so basicially, both side are right....yay?"
26-04-2018T19:09:13,Bgrmystr2,"The difference being that humans are sexual in nature, it's a fact of our genetic code. It makes up a part of who we are as an animal."
26-04-2018T19:09:23,totallynotTrace,generaly jerking it 3+ times a week is evidence of an addiction
26-04-2018T19:09:27,Bgrmystr2,Alchohol is not quite the same
26-04-2018T19:10:18,Vatruvius,I did not say porn is a terrible thing if mamaged. But if porn is your pastime there is something wrong.
26-04-2018T19:10:30,Vatruvius,managed*
26-04-2018T19:10:31,totallynotTrace,bgr: the addiction can have a severe impact on life for both
26-04-2018T19:10:39,Bgrmystr2,"I would say that is just a judgemental view, vatru."
26-04-2018T19:10:53,Bgrmystr2,"Addiction to anything is bad, yes"
26-04-2018T19:11:30,Bgrmystr2,"I think that tiger needs more floof, xex."
26-04-2018T19:11:37,Vatruvius,"I am not judging anyone Bgr, I am speaking from personal experience and ftom what I have seen porn do to friends."
26-04-2018T19:11:55,Vatruvius,I am not some staut Christian holding up a cross.
26-04-2018T19:11:58,Xexanoth,then go to the tiger and use a Dryer to make him more floofy
26-04-2018T19:12:24,Xexanoth,*Man brakes into Tiger exhibit to blow dry tigers...mauled to death* XD
26-04-2018T19:12:25,Bgrmystr2,"&gt;""If you X, then something is wrong with you""&gt;""Not judging anyone"""
26-04-2018T19:12:29,Bgrmystr2,"okay, vatru"
26-04-2018T19:12:39,totallynotTrace,give the tiger some balloons. Staticy
26-04-2018T19:12:51,Bgrmystr2,literal definition of judging people xD
26-04-2018T19:13:12,Bgrmystr2,"yess, baloons :balloon::balloon:"
26-04-2018T19:13:36,Bgrmystr2,they are the best
26-04-2018T19:15:11,Vatruvius,"You are taking my comment out of context. If we are slinging judgemental statements then saying I am tacteless because of X is not judgemental? From my experience in this chat Bgr, if someone foes not agree with you they are always tactless or misinformed"
26-04-2018T19:15:38,Vatruvius,does*
26-04-2018T19:16:56,Vatruvius,"No matter, I am not interested in ruining my mood for the evening arguing with you again. Bye guys."
26-04-2018T19:17:05,Bgrmystr2,"I'm taking it literally in context, but you can't seem to handle being called out for what you're doing. Judging someone simply based on their preferences is being judgemental. That's not the same as judging someone based on their actions."
26-04-2018T19:17:34,Bgrmystr2,Actions speak louder than words. Always.
26-04-2018T19:18:00,DRAGONTANOPUG,Not

26-04-2018T19:22:11,totallynotTrace,one sec

26-04-2018T19:23:59,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's addiction though

26-04-2018T19:24:40,Bgrmystr2,it has sources for everything it says at the bottom of the page
26-04-2018T19:24:51,Bgrmystr2,so you can check yourself if you're using wiki as a resource for somethiing you're doing
26-04-2018T19:25:00,totallynotTrace,this goes over more the behavioral side of it. https://www.projectknow.com/research/porn-addiction/?utm_term=p_addiction
26-04-2018T19:25:26,Bgrmystr2,also addiction ^
26-04-2018T19:25:34,PalmettoPathfinder1,It's just that the fact that anyone can edit it is what makes teachers and professors wary of letting students use it as a source.
26-04-2018T19:25:34,Zakuru,yo
26-04-2018T19:25:39,DRAGONTANOPUG,Yo

26-04-2018T20:52:08,Bgrmystr2,"different world, obviously"

26-04-2018T20:52:19,MuonNeutrino,@KuroganeWatanoshi iirc he said fliping things helps him catch inaccuracies
26-04-2018T20:52:27,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Nek's swimsuits are quite good, yes"
26-04-2018T20:52:32,TheFDdriver,yep @ItsActuallyKopyKat

26-04-2018T20:53:05,CrRAR,pants... optional!
26-04-2018T20:53:06,Bgrmystr2,every artist I know flips their canvas for some reason or another
26-04-2018T20:53:09,ItsActuallyKopyKat,no pants for Kat!
26-04-2018T20:53:24,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Booty^2
26-04-2018T20:53:30,SageSaga,ive explained the Flip canvas thing before do i need to again?
26-04-2018T20:53:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,she's not allowed in the no pants party
26-04-2018T20:53:34,Bgrmystr2,Fighting the war on Pants :D
26-04-2018T20:53:45,ItsActuallyKopyKat,yes pls I haven't read that one @Sage
26-04-2018T20:53:46,unsteddyphoenix,"In Twokinds, pants are seen socially as ""for nerds"""
26-04-2018T20:53:47,TheDixieNutjob,not to me you don't Sage
26-04-2018T20:53:55,Whitestripes,Pants are so uncivilized
26-04-2018T20:53:56,TheDixieNutjob,I remember from last time
26-04-2018T20:54:03,Keeeef,how does flipping the canvas help the inking process?
26-04-2018T20:54:13,Lukewci25,War on Pants? Are we in the Strike Witches universe?
26-04-2018T20:54:13,TheFDdriver,i havent been here so no Sage
26-04-2018T20:54:22,Bgrmystr2,Ayy Luke got it :D

26-04-2018T20:54:40,TheDixieNutjob,"believe it or not, flipping an image helps you spot mistakes in anatomy"
26-04-2018T20:54:42,SageSaga,ok Listen up folks- Artist often use the MIRROR function because the human brain is a tricky thing. While drawing you see things how you want them to look
26-04-2018T20:54:45,Keeeef,wow
26-04-2018T20:54:50,thestooge,Is that a small heart on Kat's butt cheek?
26-04-2018T20:54:56,totallynotTrace,epic music
26-04-2018T20:54:56,ItsActuallyKopyKat,yes stooge
26-04-2018T20:55:01,DRAGONTANOPUG,Nah
26-04-2018T20:55:02,KuroganeWatanoshi,ah that makes sense
26-04-2018T20:55:05,MrAMP,Plus it's easier.
26-04-2018T20:55:08,SageSaga,One thing artist would do is show their work to someone else - and that other person would say what looks wrong
26-04-2018T20:55:11,Lukewci25,"Well, I study Asian studies and I'm keen on World war II, so Strike Witches was an obivous choice for me"
26-04-2018T20:55:20,MrAMP,Also really shipping these two.
26-04-2018T20:55:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,no
26-04-2018T20:55:26,RH0DE,samw
26-04-2018T20:55:26,SageSaga,but we dont always have another person to do that - so we use a trick people with Dyslexia use
26-04-2018T20:55:28,Keeeef,yes
26-04-2018T20:55:31,SageSaga,we look at it in a mirror
26-04-2018T20:55:33,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"I see, thanks Sage!"
26-04-2018T20:55:35,Keeeef,marv is lurking
26-04-2018T20:55:39,KuroganeWatanoshi,huh
26-04-2018T20:55:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,well me and many others are not Amp
26-04-2018T20:55:49,KuroganeWatanoshi,never thought of it that way
26-04-2018T20:55:55,SageSaga,"this instantly highlights areas that look off- it doesnt just ""look off because it's in a mirror"" its because it was drawn wrong"
26-04-2018T20:56:04,Bgrmystr2,"Good pick, Luke :thumbsup:"
26-04-2018T20:56:04,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"well Marv is quite upset, keef"
26-04-2018T20:56:08,MrAMP,I'm reminded of that mirror song.
26-04-2018T20:56:09,ItsActuallyKopyKat,it is to be expected
26-04-2018T20:56:11,Keeeef,ay
26-04-2018T20:56:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,upsetty is me
26-04-2018T20:56:16,SageSaga,an image shouldnt look weird if you mirror it- if it does its not the mirror messing it up- its the art itself
26-04-2018T20:56:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,MarvTheUpsetPahraoh
26-04-2018T20:56:35,NaughtyKura,Hi hi
26-04-2018T20:56:37,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"you mean, ""mirror, mirror?"" @Amp"

26-04-2018T20:56:43,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Can somone explain to me, why i dont KNOW HOW TO AIM!!!!!"

26-04-2018T20:56:58,ItsActuallyKopyKat,lol
26-04-2018T20:56:58,SageSaga,some artist will mirror their image while sketching to see issues- and some just do it at inking and fix it as they go
26-04-2018T20:57:03,TheFDdriver,try no scoping
26-04-2018T20:57:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"no, I need a wall to punch ;-;"
26-04-2018T20:57:15,RH0DE,lol
26-04-2018T20:57:18,SageSaga,and that concludes why artist mirror their work while drawing
26-04-2018T20:57:25,ItsActuallyKopyKat,sounds like you need a hug... come 'ere
26-04-2018T20:57:29,TheFDdriver,i am at your service @Marv
26-04-2018T20:57:33,BadFoMo,"@SageSaga Is that anything like that illusion where the persion's picture looks fine unside down, but when fliped, you see that the eyes and/or mouth are still fliped?"
26-04-2018T20:57:40,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"It's ok. There, there. Everything will be alright"
26-04-2018T20:57:41,Bgrmystr2,Marv needs another himself
26-04-2018T20:57:45,ItsActuallyKopyKat,@marv

26-04-2018T20:58:50,RH0DE,"Tom, are forcing us to put these two on a ship? Because it really feels like it"

26-04-2018T20:59:09,Twokinds,Been a long time since I've drawn Kat with her scrunchie.
26-04-2018T20:59:15,unsteddyphoenix,Tom stop forcing your AGENDA down our throats
26-04-2018T20:59:18,SageSaga,see a skilled artist watching someone else draw will notice mistakes that the one drawing might not - but that person will see them when they mirror it
26-04-2018T20:59:22,unsteddyphoenix,Oh yeah
26-04-2018T20:59:25,CrRAR,Kat's gotta meet people.

26-04-2018T21:36:56,RH0DE,toLoveRU is the name
26-04-2018T21:36:57,ItsActuallyKopyKat,momo is the best character ever!

26-04-2018T21:37:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Oooo flying
26-04-2018T21:37:04,SageSaga,im just not sure the controls in general will translate well- or if capcom will map them well to a Keyboard tbh
26-04-2018T21:37:05,Mislakane,so controller makes it simple
26-04-2018T21:37:10,ItsActuallyKopyKat,from avatar
26-04-2018T21:37:13,Bgrmystr2,You can probably find a dozen anime with a character named momo

26-04-2018T21:37:49,Mihari,"I know how the aiming works, but I think you can still be more precise when it comes to targeting specific things like horns or tails on the move."
26-04-2018T21:37:50,Flareuim,"Rush b in airsoft too, its fun"
26-04-2018T21:38:06,Mislakane,:thinking:
26-04-2018T21:38:12,SageSaga,aiming is different in MHW than the previous ones too Mihari so it might be good with mouse
26-04-2018T21:38:15,Mykell,I did that once in airsoft
26-04-2018T21:38:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel I prefer Delta myself
26-04-2018T21:38:23,SemiDemiGod,I either rush in and get max damage or i stay as far as possible with a sniper

26-04-2018T22:01:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Allow this one to refresh your memory
26-04-2018T22:01:13,Whitestripes,Twokinds is the only webcomic I've ever read
26-04-2018T22:01:27,Bgrmystr2,"expand your horizons, White"
26-04-2018T22:01:28,SageSaga,you should fix that
26-04-2018T22:01:32,Ordithus,Twokinds and Artificial Incident are fun.  I still have not read Yosh :ptv-uneasy:
26-04-2018T22:01:34,SageSaga,perhaps with some Artificial Incident
26-04-2018T22:01:46,MrRetroRealm,"I read two webcomics by my friend, I was definitely diappointed"
26-04-2018T22:01:47,DRAGONTANOPUG,What other comics are good?
26-04-2018T22:01:57,SageSaga,but not Yosh - Yosh is for only the hardest core people

26-04-2018T22:02:01,Whitestripes,Isn't that your comic Sage?

26-04-2018T22:02:11,SageSaga,yes
26-04-2018T22:02:14,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, you have to be real tough to read Yosh"

26-04-2018T22:02:25,Whitestripes,I'll give it a looksy when I can

26-04-2018T22:03:11,SageSaga,no- there's very little in Yosh that would be Inappropriate

26-04-2018T22:03:22,MrRetroRealm,"I mean, I don't really see anything wrong with the comic, I'm just not interested"
26-04-2018T22:03:23,ZRO4825,Except Blue
26-04-2018T22:03:25,DRAGONTANOPUG,Hmmmm
26-04-2018T22:03:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Depends on your definition of inappropriate
26-04-2018T22:03:42,Bgrmystr2,"Sounds like you're holding it against the comic, Retro"
26-04-2018T22:03:46,SageSaga,Blue is just Honest
26-04-2018T22:03:50,SageSaga,and a little creepy sometimes
26-04-2018T22:03:52,ZRO4825,Blue is our favorite piece of inappropriateness. &lt;3
26-04-2018T22:03:53,MrRetroRealm,"No no, is the genre"
26-04-2018T22:03:58,RH0DE,I keep spacing out
26-04-2018T22:04:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Some have a higher guidelines than others
26-04-2018T22:04:14,RH0DE,and forgetting what im supposed to be doing
26-04-2018T22:04:15,MrRetroRealm,I'm not saying the comic is bad
26-04-2018T22:04:23,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: mmhm
26-04-2018T22:04:27,MrRetroRealm,I'm saying I just don't wanna read it is all
26-04-2018T22:05:16,DRAGONTANOPUG,U know when you get really mad ina video game and say random shit........ well i just screamed hes f***ing me in the ass. 😓
26-04-2018T22:05:22,SageSaga,then you could look at it for artistic reasons!
26-04-2018T22:05:32,Bgrmystr2,^
26-04-2018T22:05:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Do keep that to yourself
26-04-2018T22:05:35,SageSaga,and if you accidentally read it and like it- then no harm! :D

26-04-2018T22:06:12,Bgrmystr2,I never had faith in the few people I didn't have faith in to begin with
26-04-2018T22:06:15,MrEase,Or you could just read it for the cheesecake
26-04-2018T22:06:21,unsteddyphoenix,oops I slipped and read 1000 pages

26-04-2018T22:06:30,MrRetroRealm,Why are people so defensive that there is someone not wanting to read Twokinds?
26-04-2018T22:06:36,RH0DE,dunno
26-04-2018T22:06:45,DRAGONTANOPUG,? Dknow

26-04-2018T22:13:19,MrRetroRealm,Is Twokinds really that good a comic?
26-04-2018T22:13:25,MrEase,that tells the streamers how much water they should have consumed in the last hour
26-04-2018T22:13:27,Bgrmystr2,it is.
26-04-2018T22:13:33,MrRetroRealm,Hmm
26-04-2018T22:13:39,Dadrobit,It depends on how much you erad into it.
26-04-2018T22:13:40,aeoronwah,"Speaking of water, my co-worker didn't know how to pronounce la croix and ended up pronouncing it L A Crocs"

26-04-2018T22:13:46,Bgrmystr2,It's been highly rated on TopWebcomics for many years far as I recall
26-04-2018T22:13:49,ZRO4825,"It started kinda rocky, but that's nearly any webcomic. Once you get later into the story it picks up and starts getting good."
26-04-2018T22:13:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom has his own mini him in the comic. He makes pizza for the rest of the characters
26-04-2018T22:13:50,Zakuru,its self explanatory Retro

26-04-2018T22:14:43,Dadrobit,*Booking intensifies*
26-04-2018T22:14:43,Ordithus,That  is unlikely
26-04-2018T22:14:45,Bgrmystr2,It likely won't.
26-04-2018T22:14:46,Keeeef,wb tom
26-04-2018T22:14:48,DRAGONTANOPUG,Just about 3 more chapters
26-04-2018T22:14:53,Bgrmystr2,You have to buy the books online
26-04-2018T22:14:53,SageSaga,Ordithus- its not that unlikely
26-04-2018T22:14:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Got a big ol glass of water 💧
26-04-2018T22:14:59,aeoronwah,HHHHHHHHH I can't wait for my volume 4 hardcover to arrive
26-04-2018T22:15:02,Ordithus,Really?
26-04-2018T22:15:02,MuonNeutrino,"IMO the first half dozen chapters or so (the initial story arc) are a bit weird; toms was still finding his feet as a storyteller and it shows. from that point on it's extremely good, and even the early chapters aren't *bad*"
26-04-2018T22:15:07,MuonNeutrino,*tom was
26-04-2018T22:15:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,same Aeoron
26-04-2018T22:15:08,totallynotTrace,I like going through the archive and looking at how his art style/ skill has changed over the years
26-04-2018T22:15:27,DRAGONTANOPUG,Big ass foreheads in chapter 8
26-04-2018T22:15:27,SageSaga,someone found my book in a used bookstore- there were only 200 copies in the wild
26-04-2018T22:15:35,ZRO4825,o_O
26-04-2018T22:15:37,unsteddyphoenix,huh.
26-04-2018T22:15:41,Ordithus,"Huh, that is remarkable"
26-04-2018T22:15:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,the hunt begins
26-04-2018T22:15:47,aeoronwah,That's incredible
26-04-2018T22:15:56,Bgrmystr2,"yeah Sage, meaning the chances of that happening to one person is ""unlikely"""
26-04-2018T22:15:56,aeoronwah,"like, those are some pretty low odds"
26-04-2018T22:15:56,ZRO4825,Mine is never going anywhere I do not go. o.o
26-04-2018T22:16:00,SageSaga,so a book like Twokinds getting donated to a library? Pretty likely
26-04-2018T22:16:00,Bgrmystr2,I think Ord's correct in this case.
26-04-2018T22:16:03,Ordithus,"I knew Zen roleplayed a playa on the weekends, but this is still really forward of him.  Down boy, down!"
26-04-2018T22:16:21,MuonNeutrino,"@MrRetroRealm you're not going to find printed copies just randomly in a library; there have been prints, but they've been limited circulation"
26-04-2018T22:16:21,ZRO4825,Zen has found the breast pillows ever.
26-04-2018T22:16:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"gotta keep the separated, ord"
26-04-2018T22:16:32,ItsActuallyKopyKat,I have returned!

26-04-2018T22:16:36,ItsActuallyKopyKat,What did i miss
26-04-2018T22:16:36,Ordithus,lol ZRO
26-04-2018T22:16:42,Dadrobit,It's definitely possible I'd think to find a copy in a library if it's in a good city.
26-04-2018T22:16:43,RH0DE,lol
26-04-2018T22:16:46,ItsActuallyKopyKat,zro plsssss
26-04-2018T22:16:46,totallynotTrace,"ah, and the motorboating has started"

26-04-2018T22:16:59,ItsActuallyKopyKat,the motorboat is sailing~~
26-04-2018T22:17:02,Bgrmystr2,"Even if someone DID donate a copy of twokinds to a library, the chances of that library being the same one he checks"
26-04-2018T22:17:06,Bgrmystr2,are not high
26-04-2018T22:17:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Bad Zen, I told you, you can do better"
26-04-2018T22:17:14,RH0DE,lol
26-04-2018T22:17:16,ZRO4825,"I'm just saying, I don't blame Zen. I'd do it too. :3"

26-04-2018T22:17:37,MrRetroRealm,Maybe I'll give Twokinds a chance one day
26-04-2018T22:17:38,Ordithus,How many of books 1-3 of TK have been distributed?
26-04-2018T22:17:41,ZRO4825,"Was gonna say, that's nothing new where Zen's involved in canon. :P"
26-04-2018T22:17:46,MrRetroRealm,Right now I'm focused on my own work
26-04-2018T22:17:48,DRAGONTANOPUG,1 thro 4
26-04-2018T22:17:51,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. it's not like there's a website where you can read it all online somewhere.. or whatever.. :thinking:
26-04-2018T22:17:52,Dadrobit,"Haven't been to the library in a few months, might head in and check the young adult section for webcomic prints."
26-04-2018T22:17:52,MuonNeutrino,also TBH tk might be considered a bit nsfw by some libraries &gt;.&gt;
26-04-2018T22:18:03,unsteddyphoenix,"what a big scream, you'd think she'd be more used to unwanted advances."
26-04-2018T22:18:07,ZRO4825,Naked tigers everywhere.
26-04-2018T22:18:07,DRAGONTANOPUG,Nsfw stands for
26-04-2018T22:18:10,ZRO4825,So many Keiths.
26-04-2018T22:18:17,MrEase,Not Safe for Work
26-04-2018T22:18:20,SageSaga,most libraries dont check all their graphic novels-
26-04-2018T22:18:22,DRAGONTANOPUG,Look at all the floras
26-04-2018T22:18:26,unsteddyphoenix,not safe for wlibraries
26-04-2018T22:18:37,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Also, libraries have plaenty of nsfw books, in my experience"
26-04-2018T22:18:41,MrEase,which twokinds definitely treads the line on
26-04-2018T22:18:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Some libraries cannot handle the booty
26-04-2018T22:18:46,Twokinds,I don't think so
26-04-2018T22:18:47,Dadrobit,"Yeah, truth. Got some of my first taste of ""Graphic"" novel from the city library."
26-04-2018T22:18:50,SageSaga,i found a lot of MA rated Manga at my old library
26-04-2018T22:18:57,ItsActuallyKopyKat,^^

26-04-2018T22:19:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Berserk?
26-04-2018T22:19:35,MrRetroRealm,And there was tons of fanservice
26-04-2018T22:19:40,DRAGONTANOPUG,Being  Young
26-04-2018T22:19:42,Dadrobit,"It was a retelling of ""Euridicie"" but in graphic novel form. And it did not pull any punches."
26-04-2018T22:19:46,MrRetroRealm,It took me nearly a year to notice
26-04-2018T22:19:50,Twokinds,"I mean my first experience reading manga was in libraries, and some had fanservice."
26-04-2018T22:19:55,Twokinds,Though maybe they just didn't know.
