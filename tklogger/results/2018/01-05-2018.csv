01-05-2018T00:01:41,NightMeaty22,Try bee pollen for allergies it helps

01-05-2018T00:02:23,NightMeaty22,Cya
01-05-2018T00:02:27,Vatruvius,Stop it with the allergies!
01-05-2018T00:02:34,Dadrobit,My allergies are helpless. I am allergic to every grass and weed in AZ. Used to get weekly shots for them.
01-05-2018T00:03:19,TheBeckoner,Rain is nice
01-05-2018T00:03:25,TheBeckoner,both ones
01-05-2018T00:03:30,DRAGONTANOPUG,K now im cranky i just got the stream started.. its more than 24 hours late.
01-05-2018T00:03:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m allergic to social interaction. That cunt?
01-05-2018T00:03:37,TheBeckoner,hahah
01-05-2018T00:03:38,SpazztasticKiwi,*COUNT
01-05-2018T00:03:48,SpazztasticKiwi,COUNT COUNT COUNT
01-05-2018T00:04:01,TheBeckoner,*Implying social interactions is a person and also a cunt
01-05-2018T00:04:02,NightMeaty22,Um...
01-05-2018T00:04:05,Vatruvius,There has to be a reason why you are reacting to them so severely. Are you eating any foods regularly you could be allergic to? Doing so would result in a weak immune system that could react to the slightest thing.
01-05-2018T00:04:24,TheBeckoner,Vat is correct
01-05-2018T00:04:31,Vatruvius,lol...Kiwi
01-05-2018T00:05:05,DRAGONTANOPUG,Its just typo:ptv-kippi2:
01-05-2018T00:05:08,Dadrobit,The only food allergy that I'm aware of is to bananas.
01-05-2018T00:05:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Basically me in a conversation with someone attractive
01-05-2018T00:05:26,SpazztasticKiwi,English is broken
01-05-2018T00:05:27,Vatruvius,Forever in memoriam.
01-05-2018T00:05:44,Dadrobit,Otherwise I'm just a sniffly mess whenever dust and pollen get kicked up.
01-05-2018T00:05:54,Vatruvius,"Who here is attractive, we are avatars?"
01-05-2018T00:06:13,Dadrobit,I have it on good authority that I am a 7.
01-05-2018T00:06:15,DRAGONTANOPUG,I dunno are we
01-05-2018T00:06:26,SpazztasticKiwi,You guys can fight amongst yourselves to figure out who it is
01-05-2018T00:06:30,Vatruvius,"I see, read it wrong again!"
01-05-2018T00:06:34,SpazztasticKiwi,:ptv-snicker:
01-05-2018T00:06:44,Dadrobit,If Marv is to be a believable source.
01-05-2018T00:06:50,Vatruvius,I will be the Flora here and just take third.
01-05-2018T00:06:57,DRAGONTANOPUG,Heh
01-05-2018T00:07:36,DRAGONTANOPUG,Idek what yoir talkin abot but im screig up my typing and i need to slleep.
01-05-2018T00:07:53,DRAGONTANOPUG,Damn its that bad
01-05-2018T00:08:00,Vatruvius,Then put the phone down and sleep!
01-05-2018T00:08:34,DRAGONTANOPUG,puts down mobile device and falls asleep.
01-05-2018T00:09:33,Vatruvius,"Dark Souls 3 Parody: *squints* ""Good."""
01-05-2018T00:14:04,Vatruvius,"Among your comic Tom, if you were to be a Keidran which would you be? Or would you be a Basitin or stay human?"
01-05-2018T00:14:09,Vatruvius,Anyone can answer I guess.
01-05-2018T00:17:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d have no idea what to do with myself if I was Kiedran or Basitin
01-05-2018T00:18:02,Vatruvius,But which would you be?
01-05-2018T00:18:13,Dadrobit,Why anyone would want to be a keidran or basitin over being human is beyond me.
01-05-2018T00:18:22,Vatruvius,"Say you were in Mekkan, what would be a preference?"
01-05-2018T00:18:23,unsteddyphoenix,Innate magic is op
01-05-2018T00:18:39,Vatruvius,"Meh, you guys are missing the point."
01-05-2018T00:18:44,unsteddyphoenix,Humans have it way better
01-05-2018T00:18:52,unsteddyphoenix,Theyre like elves in any other fantasy
01-05-2018T00:19:07,unsteddyphoenix,Actually elves are way stronger but
01-05-2018T00:19:12,unsteddyphoenix,more or less
01-05-2018T00:21:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"Don’t get me wrong, I’d like having claws but I’m not sure about walking around essentially naked"
01-05-2018T00:21:27,unsteddyphoenix,What thats the perk
01-05-2018T00:21:50,Dadrobit,"I mean, you can do that as a human as well to be fair."
01-05-2018T00:22:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Not legally
01-05-2018T00:22:15,Dadrobit,Meh
01-05-2018T00:22:18,Vatruvius,"Right, but Keidran have a different sense of naked."
01-05-2018T00:22:43,Vatruvius,has*
01-05-2018T00:26:11,TheBeckoner,Human is good. Although strong human tend to be chunky not all are super weak
01-05-2018T00:26:38,TheBeckoner,how many notches down is a strong human from a strong basitin?
01-05-2018T00:26:43,TheBeckoner,like 2?
01-05-2018T00:26:50,TheBeckoner,maybe 3?
01-05-2018T00:27:11,TheBeckoner,I assume adelaide is a freak equivalent to Paul anderson
01-05-2018T00:27:16,TheBeckoner,or something
01-05-2018T00:28:35,Vatruvius,"I personally would want to be a Basitin, just to mix things up. If I were to be a Keidran I guess I would be a snow wolf, with a panther as a close second."
01-05-2018T00:29:49,TheBeckoner,I'd be human. Magic is good imo
01-05-2018T00:30:05,Vatruvius,Oh you are no fun.
01-05-2018T00:30:39,Vatruvius,"You would be that guy that joins D&D the first time and ask, what is the most powerful class/race?"
01-05-2018T00:31:13,TheBeckoner,well
01-05-2018T00:31:16,TheBeckoner,maybe...
01-05-2018T00:31:26,TheBeckoner,Never played D&D tho
01-05-2018T00:31:35,TheBeckoner,But Basitin would be cool
01-05-2018T00:32:03,TheBeckoner,I mean I would pick a kedran race but they die quick sooooo
01-05-2018T00:32:07,Vatruvius,Ever think about creating a Twokinds D&D Tom?
01-05-2018T00:32:21,Twokinds,no
01-05-2018T00:32:23,Vatruvius,The life expectancy. Yeah.
01-05-2018T00:32:39,Dadrobit,"If I'm living in Mekkan, then my life is on the line and you better damn well believe that I'm picking OP."
01-05-2018T00:32:58,Vatruvius,Maybe.
01-05-2018T00:34:30,TheBeckoner,If we can pick that is
01-05-2018T00:34:41,TheBeckoner,Human for me tho.
01-05-2018T00:34:49,Vatruvius,"I like adventure and something new. OP humans is not new at all. I like skill over brute force. Knowledge, finesse, limits. Plus, being a human is not a guarantee OP magic wielder."
01-05-2018T00:35:47,Dadrobit,Being born keidran does not guarantee that you'll even be born free.
01-05-2018T00:35:47,TheBeckoner,I like brute force and power so Basitin would be cool but then again no magic...not that I have any now
01-05-2018T00:36:18,Dadrobit,And being born basitin does not mean you'll be a particularly strong basitin. You might just end up being a bridge guard to a graveyard.
01-05-2018T00:36:42,Twokinds,Then just pick a Keitin.
01-05-2018T00:36:53,Twokinds,"Magic of Keidran, vitality of Basitin."
01-05-2018T00:37:29,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
01-05-2018T00:37:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Seems doable
01-05-2018T00:37:36,Bgrmystr2,legit
01-05-2018T00:37:47,Dadrobit,"What is Landen? Vitality of human, strength of basitin. Humitin?"
01-05-2018T00:37:57,Bgrmystr2,haha
01-05-2018T00:38:43,unsteddyphoenix,minmax
01-05-2018T00:38:46,unsteddyphoenix,whats the min
01-05-2018T00:39:05,Twokinds,Just don't accidentally get it mixed up with Basidren.
01-05-2018T00:39:34,Twokinds,"Life of Keidran, Magiclessness of Basitin, 2x weakness to ankles."
01-05-2018T00:39:57,SpazztasticKiwi,My ankles are already weak
01-05-2018T00:40:11,Dadrobit,:facepalm:
01-05-2018T00:40:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Double jointed
01-05-2018T00:40:59,unsteddyphoenix,oof
01-05-2018T00:41:01,SpazztasticKiwi,“Magiclessness”. Where did you go to school
01-05-2018T00:41:15,Vatruvius,lol
01-05-2018T00:41:36,Vatruvius,He is a dropout like Mark. He could have been an engineer!
01-05-2018T00:41:43,Vatruvius,:ptv-tease:
01-05-2018T00:41:56,Dadrobit,uhhh
01-05-2018T00:42:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I thought he was gonna be a radiologist
01-05-2018T00:42:16,Twokinds,What! I'm not a dropout.
01-05-2018T00:42:23,Twokinds,I have a college degree!
01-05-2018T00:42:31,TheBeckoner,Even worse!
01-05-2018T00:42:35,Vatruvius,"It was a joke Tom, a reference to your brother."
01-05-2018T00:42:37,SpazztasticKiwi,...you do?
01-05-2018T00:42:49,Twokinds,But it's an incorrect reference.
01-05-2018T00:42:58,TheBeckoner,College is a scam don't yah know!
01-05-2018T00:43:11,Twokinds,Eh
01-05-2018T00:43:13,Vatruvius,"Incorrect, how?"
01-05-2018T00:43:19,Twokinds,I feel like I learned some stuff.
01-05-2018T00:43:26,Twokinds,I never spent much at college.
01-05-2018T00:43:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Like how much you should avoid people?
01-05-2018T00:43:53,TheBeckoner,Im sorta kidding. college is more what you make it unlike a public school
01-05-2018T00:44:13,TheBeckoner,And Im doing college as cheap as I can until I cant
01-05-2018T00:44:21,TheBeckoner,Enjoying it so far
01-05-2018T00:47:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a cat pillow
01-05-2018T00:51:03,TheBeckoner,possibly good
01-05-2018T00:52:01,Vatruvius,"Finally, time to play some games!"
01-05-2018T01:01:42,Dadrobit,"Ughhhhh, speaking of school, I need to remember to put aside time to take my final exam for Copyright Law tomorrow..."
01-05-2018T01:02:01,Dadrobit,3 hour exam. Need an 83% to maintain an A.
01-05-2018T01:03:48,Dadrobit,Stressing out over finals is a favorite pastime for me recently...
01-05-2018T01:04:46,TheBeckoner,haha same...
01-05-2018T01:04:54,TheBeckoner,need an A on my trig final
01-05-2018T01:05:07,TheBeckoner,everything else is pretty much set in stone at this point
01-05-2018T01:10:22,TheBeckoner,Ooh its late...Goodnight you peoples
01-05-2018T01:11:05,Dadrobit,Night
01-05-2018T01:29:31,Twokinds,explodes
01-05-2018T01:30:13,Vatruvius,tries to put what is left of Tom back together along with some fancy tech.
01-05-2018T01:33:51,Dadrobit,Anything worth exploding over in particular?
01-05-2018T01:35:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Frustration
01-05-2018T01:36:03,unsteddyphoenix,Sometimes you get the urge...
01-05-2018T01:37:01,SpazztasticKiwi,...talking about work frustration
01-05-2018T01:37:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Take it down a notch or two
01-05-2018T01:39:39,SpazztasticKiwi,You know I was thinking of this one teacher I had in high school. At the end of every year she’d have each of us sit in the front of the class and the class would have to say one nice thing about the person in the front chair
01-05-2018T01:40:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, Vat made cyborg Tom"
01-05-2018T01:40:45,Dadrobit,That sound horrifying tbh. The classroom bit.
01-05-2018T01:40:54,unsteddyphoenix,So was she arrested for torture?
01-05-2018T01:46:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"We all took it in stride. For the most part, people got along in our grade"
01-05-2018T01:46:49,unsteddyphoenix,It was kind and normal torture
01-05-2018T01:46:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless you want to count the time those two boys just started decking each other in the hall
01-05-2018T01:46:52,unsteddyphoenix,Rather than the opposite
01-05-2018T01:47:03,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh, like they were playing card games?"
01-05-2018T01:47:08,unsteddyphoenix,Mustve been intense
01-05-2018T01:47:11,unsteddyphoenix,~
01-05-2018T01:47:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Nope. One just straight up punched the other in the face and a fight started
01-05-2018T01:48:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Then there was the guy who threw another’s shoe out the window
01-05-2018T01:48:12,unsteddyphoenix,mustve gotten a good card
01-05-2018T01:48:22,unsteddyphoenix,"Man, what."
01-05-2018T01:48:25,unsteddyphoenix,Cmon.
01-05-2018T01:48:46,SpazztasticKiwi,And the time someone locked another’s shoe in some random locker
01-05-2018T01:49:12,unsteddyphoenix,:T
01-05-2018T01:49:15,SpazztasticKiwi,And the time one guy set a paper towel on fire and had to go to the bathroom to put it out
01-05-2018T01:49:15,unsteddyphoenix,I hate kids.
01-05-2018T01:49:38,Vatruvius,"Wow, how my reaction times have gone to shit. Going to need a lot of practice before they get anywhere near where they were a couple months ago. Gotten soft playing slow paced games, that and the lack of a crouch button forced me to not play my FPS games."
01-05-2018T01:49:44,SpazztasticKiwi,And the girl that got caught smoking in the bathroom
01-05-2018T01:50:07,Vatruvius,My early college high school is sounding better and better.
01-05-2018T01:50:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Or the couple that was caught having sex under the stairs
01-05-2018T01:50:23,Vatruvius,That was the best place they could find?
01-05-2018T01:50:41,unsteddyphoenix,the risk is part of the fun~
01-05-2018T01:50:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Ironically enough it’s one of the few that didn’t have cameras
01-05-2018T01:51:26,Vatruvius,One of the few stairs or one of the few schools to have cameras?
01-05-2018T01:51:47,SpazztasticKiwi,We have cameras basically everywhere but the stairs
01-05-2018T01:52:17,Vatruvius,Wow.
01-05-2018T01:52:24,Vatruvius,My small town school sounds great.
01-05-2018T01:52:36,Dadrobit,"For us, we all just used the band practice rooms."
01-05-2018T01:52:57,Vatruvius,Poor band members.
01-05-2018T01:52:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Talk about playing an instrument
01-05-2018T01:53:10,Vatruvius,Kiwi...nooo!
01-05-2018T01:53:14,Dadrobit,Each section of the band had their own room that had its door window covered by a poster made by that section.
01-05-2018T01:53:22,unsteddyphoenix,Fiddlers must've been popular
01-05-2018T01:53:22,Dadrobit,So it was perfectly hidden.
01-05-2018T01:53:45,Dadrobit,"Lemme tell ya, instruments were only the second most blown things in those rooms."
01-05-2018T01:54:01,unsteddyphoenix,ayyy~ :ptv-dealwithit:
01-05-2018T01:54:06,SpazztasticKiwi,High school

01-05-2018T01:54:25,unsteddyphoenix,High  school: not even once
01-05-2018T01:54:31,Dadrobit,"Everyone in the band was friends, s it just kinda happened ya know."
01-05-2018T01:54:32,Vatruvius,People hate school so much or are so impatient they have to do it at school. *sigh/facepalm*
01-05-2018T01:54:42,Dadrobit,so it*
01-05-2018T01:55:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"So Tom, why’d you explode?"
01-05-2018T01:55:43,Vatruvius,Alright...I am going to get off and just read the comic some more. Throw in some music. Good night everyone!

01-05-2018T14:11:47,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, Kiwi, I think it affects more ppl if tom has it than if you have it :P"
01-05-2018T14:12:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Mine will probably get better as I wake up
01-05-2018T14:13:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Think I just slept weird
01-05-2018T14:18:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera was sleeping next to my face though
01-05-2018T15:05:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera’s warming up to the kitten
01-05-2018T15:32:06,Twokinds,Back from mowing the lawn.
01-05-2018T15:32:11,Twokinds,That's my outside for the week.
01-05-2018T15:32:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I thought that said “meowing” for a second
01-05-2018T15:33:32,SpazztasticKiwi,But didn’t you mow the lawn just last week? How fast does you grass grow?
01-05-2018T15:42:25,Twokinds,It's a pretty big lawn. Once a week keeps it from being less manageable.
01-05-2018T15:43:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Fun stuff
01-05-2018T15:46:06,SpazztasticKiwi,My grandma has a big lawn. Used to hire my ex’s uncle and cousin to mow it
01-05-2018T15:57:21,SpazztasticKiwi,She’s hired a more frequent service recently - a couple and their son I believe
01-05-2018T16:10:29,SpazztasticKiwi,There was just a hornet in my hair and now he’s loose somewhere in my room and I can’t find him
01-05-2018T16:11:55,SiliconCarbide,poor lost hornet
01-05-2018T16:12:35,Bgrmystr2,"""Poor Hornet"" dude, that's a goddamn hornet"
01-05-2018T16:12:37,Bgrmystr2,they aren't poor
01-05-2018T16:13:01,SiliconCarbide,tzz talk for yourself
01-05-2018T16:13:16,SiliconCarbide,"you never asked how they felt, did you?"
01-05-2018T16:13:20,Bgrmystr2,"I am, and for many others who've also spoken against hornets :P"
01-05-2018T16:13:23,Bgrmystr2,are you a hornet?
01-05-2018T16:13:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Then you come get it out of my room
01-05-2018T16:13:37,Bgrmystr2,"hornets and wasps, terrible the lot of em lol"
01-05-2018T16:13:37,SiliconCarbide,sure if you pay for the trip
01-05-2018T16:14:43,Bgrmystr2,do you even know what a hornet is? xD
01-05-2018T16:15:11,SpazztasticKiwi,A nope
01-05-2018T16:15:33,Bgrmystr2,definitely a nope
01-05-2018T16:15:50,SpazztasticKiwi,A stinging nope
01-05-2018T16:16:02,Bgrmystr2,with many angry
01-05-2018T16:16:22,Bgrmystr2,and very not friendly.
01-05-2018T16:16:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t think I’m gonna take that nap yet
01-05-2018T16:16:44,Bgrmystr2,Don't blame ya xD
01-05-2018T16:19:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Found him
01-05-2018T16:19:21,SpazztasticKiwi,He dead
01-05-2018T16:19:48,SiliconCarbide,aww
01-05-2018T16:23:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’m all for catch and release except when it comes to wasps. Then I turn into Capone: I want him dead, I want his family dead, and I want his house burned to the ground"
01-05-2018T16:25:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"Some girls are looking for a guy who’ll kill the spiders, I want one who’ll kill the wasps for me"
01-05-2018T16:27:07,Bgrmystr2,wasps and hornets are very territorial.
01-05-2018T16:27:26,Bgrmystr2,"between you and them, they will sting you to attempt to make you go away, or to kill you"
01-05-2018T16:27:48,Bgrmystr2,"there is no ""aww"", it's either you or them"
01-05-2018T16:28:31,Bgrmystr2,they likely aren't gonna play nice with the catch/release anyway
01-05-2018T17:13:07,DRAGONTANOPUG,Oof
01-05-2018T18:11:25,totallynotTrace,hi guys
01-05-2018T18:11:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Tried nap. Nap failed
01-05-2018T18:12:30,totallynotTrace,I had white faced hornets drive the bats out of the roof eves of my house
01-05-2018T18:12:44,totallynotTrace,I liked those bats
01-05-2018T18:31:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Are any of us getting work done
01-05-2018T18:36:17,Bgrmystr2,"I'm watching a youtube video, dunno what you're on about Kiwi :v"
01-05-2018T18:43:11,SpazztasticKiwi,YouTube
01-05-2018T19:00:37,totallynotTrace,just watched captain sparkles
01-05-2018T19:01:31,totallynotTrace,so I know this twokinds is made by tom but im just gunna say this cuz it was funny and its toms bro
01-05-2018T19:02:27,totallynotTrace,I was at my colleges art exhibit today (they refresh it every month) and someone hand drew and colored markiplier fan art
01-05-2018T19:02:43,totallynotTrace,i think they did a pretty good job
01-05-2018T19:03:15,totallynotTrace,also i dont currently have any work to do so....
01-05-2018T20:01:01,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Damnit got almost all the way through chapter 6 part voice recording, throut hot dry than i coughed and continued too."
01-05-2018T20:01:10,DRAGONTANOPUG,19 mins wasted.
01-05-2018T20:03:23,totallynotTrace,chapter 6 of what?
01-05-2018T22:04:21,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Tk, sorry for taking so long to respond making a zombies vid..."
01-05-2018T22:20:06,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Can someone explain to me why the zombie vid is 2 gigs when its uploading, but in storage its only 600 mb when its only a 9 min vid"
01-05-2018T22:23:02,totallynotTrace,that doesnt make sense at all. I would understand the other way around and say compression. but not that way
01-05-2018T22:23:55,totallynotTrace,I should also throw in there im not a streamer/content creator for the most part
01-05-2018T22:24:22,DRAGONTANOPUG,"I know, it says 2 GB but on my tablet storage its 600 MB"
01-05-2018T22:24:26,DRAGONTANOPUG,Weird
01-05-2018T22:31:29,totallynotTrace,what resolution are you recording at?
01-05-2018T22:33:13,Bgrmystr2,"You'd be right, actually. If it's smaller on his drive, that means it's compressed, and then proceeds to be uncompressed when uploaded to a different system, because it requires sending the uncompressed file in it's entirety"
01-05-2018T22:33:31,Bgrmystr2,but I highly doubt it drops from 2GB to 600MB
01-05-2018T22:33:47,Bgrmystr2,"compression on HDs is not that impressive, not even close."
01-05-2018T22:34:04,Bgrmystr2,so it's likely some other number he's looking at.
01-05-2018T22:34:30,totallynotTrace,ive cut sizes by half before
01-05-2018T22:36:54,Bgrmystr2,"With the OS compression enabled?, I'll believe it when I see it, and I haven't. I've seen all types of audio, video, game files, game data, pictures, animations, flash, etc etc"
01-05-2018T22:37:02,totallynotTrace,"i used macrium reflect for a while to regularly back up my boot drive and it had about 400 gb on it, using the more aggressive compresor i got it down to ~175gb"
01-05-2018T22:37:24,Bgrmystr2,and Windows does not compress any of them remotely close to half. Maybe 20% cut from it at most
01-05-2018T22:37:37,totallynotTrace,its now windows compression
01-05-2018T22:37:38,Bgrmystr2,and that's not what I'm talkin about
01-05-2018T22:38:03,Bgrmystr2,"then you're already broken the comparison, cuz do you really think that guy knows what compression is xD"
01-05-2018T22:38:17,totallynotTrace,clearly no
01-05-2018T22:38:52,totallynotTrace,but windows sucks at serious compression but it can do it fast which is what is required of a consumer oriented os
01-05-2018T22:38:59,Bgrmystr2,I did not know you could get that level of compression with dedicated tools though :thinking:
01-05-2018T22:39:07,totallynotTrace,yea
01-05-2018T22:39:43,totallynotTrace,but it may be possible that not all of the data was on 1 drive and it was only compressing 1 drive
01-05-2018T22:39:56,totallynotTrace,ive since stopped using macrium
01-05-2018T22:40:34,totallynotTrace,to be clear it was a compressed image that it would save as
01-05-2018T22:40:39,Bgrmystr2,"I've compressed 2tb drives filled with stuff before using windows compression, so I've seen it's abiltiy."
01-05-2018T22:40:50,Bgrmystr2,"It's fast, but not good compression"
01-05-2018T22:41:41,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, he could be looking at upload speed and not know the difference lol"
01-05-2018T22:42:16,totallynotTrace,try take a look at macrium reflect. but to be clear I only used it on a free trial (yes I exploited it for far to long) but now I just clone the drive using acronis
01-05-2018T22:43:13,Bgrmystr2,"yeah I have drive cloning and copying software, just don't really use it outside of doing those kinda things"
01-05-2018T22:43:19,Bgrmystr2,acronis being on of em
01-05-2018T22:43:21,Bgrmystr2,one*
01-05-2018T22:44:25,totallynotTrace,"so yeah if you have something to back up as a compressed file, try it out as a free trial. not that changing the setting to aggressive compression increases the time required a fair bit but it also depends on the cpu compressing it"
01-05-2018T22:44:50,totallynotTrace,I forgot an e
01-05-2018T22:45:07,totallynotTrace,*Note that changing*
01-05-2018T22:46:09,totallynotTrace,its UI is also fairly well made
01-05-2018T22:47:53,totallynotTrace,"but yeah i get what you were saying befor, Dragon probably doesnt need to know this"
01-05-2018T22:47:59,Bgrmystr2,xD
01-05-2018T22:48:06,totallynotTrace,and this doesnt really apply
01-05-2018T22:50:44,totallynotTrace,Do you have any external drive that has acronis on it?
01-05-2018T22:50:58,Bgrmystr2,all of my external drives are dead.
01-05-2018T22:51:03,Bgrmystr2,:/
01-05-2018T22:51:10,Bgrmystr2,or need repair.
01-05-2018T22:51:19,Bgrmystr2,"Bit of both, honestly."
01-05-2018T22:51:31,totallynotTrace,oh
01-05-2018T22:51:35,totallynotTrace,well
01-05-2018T22:51:46,totallynotTrace,flash drives included?
01-05-2018T22:51:58,Bgrmystr2,yeah generally.
01-05-2018T22:52:04,totallynotTrace,wow
01-05-2018T22:52:09,Bgrmystr2,the front port of my pc fried them all
01-05-2018T22:52:17,totallynotTrace,OOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooooohh
01-05-2018T22:52:25,totallynotTrace,that sucks
01-05-2018T22:52:45,totallynotTrace,ive never had that problem
01-05-2018T22:52:56,Bgrmystr2,"and once I got wind of it, I ended up losing them on a different tower completely, but same model and same front port"
01-05-2018T22:53:13,Bgrmystr2,lost one t a laptop port as well
01-05-2018T22:53:19,totallynotTrace,although I have had static kill an ethernet port
01-05-2018T22:53:23,Bgrmystr2,so basically.. 6 flash drives dead
01-05-2018T22:53:32,totallynotTrace,wow
01-05-2018T22:53:37,Bgrmystr2,Front USB tend to be kinda bad from what I've seen
01-05-2018T22:53:38,totallynotTrace,that sucks big time
01-05-2018T22:53:42,Bgrmystr2,yeh
01-05-2018T22:53:52,Bgrmystr2,can't wiggle em or they'll get fucked off real easy
01-05-2018T22:54:11,Bgrmystr2,or they could just randomly break within a few months of having the tower..
01-05-2018T22:54:17,Bgrmystr2,yknow.. whatever have you
01-05-2018T22:54:21,Bgrmystr2,&gt;:c
01-05-2018T22:55:02,totallynotTrace,I have a laptop thats  probably 6 years old. hold on im gunna check
01-05-2018T22:55:35,totallynotTrace,yeah the drivers say they were installed 2012
01-05-2018T22:55:46,totallynotTrace,thats what i use right now
01-05-2018T22:55:56,DRAGONTANOPUG,I put my camra sd card in my tablet which put from 16 Gb to 40 GB?
01-05-2018T22:55:57,Bgrmystr2,"I borrow a couple flash drives from friend of mine here and there when I need em, but I don't usually have em on me"
01-05-2018T22:56:33,DRAGONTANOPUG,Thats what you guys are talkin aboit right?
01-05-2018T22:56:57,Bgrmystr2,camera compression maybe? I wouldn't think a camera would display wrong file sizes on purpose
01-05-2018T22:57:14,Bgrmystr2,that would end up being really bad for the company that did it
01-05-2018T22:57:19,totallynotTrace,what starts out as 16 and what is 40?
01-05-2018T22:57:27,DRAGONTANOPUG,My space on my tabley
01-05-2018T22:57:31,DRAGONTANOPUG,Tablet
01-05-2018T22:57:42,totallynotTrace,is that the total space?
01-05-2018T22:57:53,DRAGONTANOPUG,Yes with the SD card
01-05-2018T22:58:02,DRAGONTANOPUG,Original is 16
01-05-2018T22:58:35,totallynotTrace,oh so the tablet said it has 16 and then when the sd card is put in it says it has 40?
01-05-2018T22:58:43,DRAGONTANOPUG,Yep
01-05-2018T22:58:47,totallynotTrace,oh
01-05-2018T22:58:57,totallynotTrace,yeah thats how removable storage works
01-05-2018T22:59:14,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
01-05-2018T22:59:23,Bgrmystr2,"Splain, lucy"
01-05-2018T22:59:30,DRAGONTANOPUG,But the amazing thing is that is a micro sd card. Which surprises me how small it is with huge amount of space.
01-05-2018T23:00:05,DRAGONTANOPUG,Thats a i love lucy reference...
01-05-2018T23:00:13,Bgrmystr2,Yes it is.
01-05-2018T23:00:26,totallynotTrace,so the sd card is 24 gb?
01-05-2018T23:00:45,Bgrmystr2,"Ah, so I'm guessing it has to do with displaying the total space including the SD card in the total"
01-05-2018T23:00:56,DRAGONTANOPUG,Its 30 but its no very compatible so it only has 24
01-05-2018T23:01:21,Bgrmystr2,that seems like it'd be misleading as hell for the user
01-05-2018T23:01:39,totallynotTrace,yeah all devices have a maximum capacity that they can utilize on an sd card
01-05-2018T23:01:48,totallynotTrace,its probably not misleading
01-05-2018T23:01:52,DRAGONTANOPUG,Or that i uploaded 4 videos before the zombie one and it glitch it out...
01-05-2018T23:02:19,Bgrmystr2,"well, my hard drive doesn't magically go from 2tb to 4tb just because I put another drive in there.."
01-05-2018T23:02:28,Bgrmystr2,each one displays separately
01-05-2018T23:02:29,DRAGONTANOPUG,My dad gave me a hard drive the size of my hand with 4 tera bytes on it!
01-05-2018T23:02:54,DRAGONTANOPUG,Yet i use it for nothing...
01-05-2018T23:03:00,totallynotTrace,"if the sd card says it is 30 gb, the manual for the tablet will tell you somewhere on it the maximum capacity that it can accept"
01-05-2018T23:03:13,DRAGONTANOPUG,Ah
01-05-2018T23:03:35,totallynotTrace,i ran into a similar problem one time before
01-05-2018T23:03:38,DRAGONTANOPUG,Well gtg to bed g'night! :ptv-greetings:
01-05-2018T23:03:49,totallynotTrace,oh ok g'night
01-05-2018T23:03:53,Bgrmystr2,"if my pc displayed 4tb as 'total storage' instead of showing 2tb on two drives, that'd be misleading to some people"
01-05-2018T23:03:54,Bgrmystr2,gnight
01-05-2018T23:04:06,totallynotTrace,i agree
01-05-2018T23:04:16,Bgrmystr2,"it's not incorrect, but would lead people to believe it would all go to the same place, which isn't true"
01-05-2018T23:04:25,totallynotTrace,he probably has a setting somewhere to go into more detail
01-05-2018T23:04:30,Bgrmystr2,"and if that's what his tablet is doing with the SD card, I would consider it misleading"
01-05-2018T23:04:37,Bgrmystr2,yeah there's prolly a setting for it lol
01-05-2018T23:04:42,Bgrmystr2,"I wouldn't know, unfortunately :/"
01-05-2018T23:04:52,totallynotTrace,my phone is android and i have an sd card
01-05-2018T23:05:28,Bgrmystr2,"don't have an android, not a fan of smart phones :u"
01-05-2018T23:06:00,totallynotTrace,I can veiw the combined storage but on another page I can seperate the phones storage statistics so i know how much space is used on each drive
01-05-2018T23:06:17,totallynotTrace,i have to use a smartphone
01-05-2018T23:07:01,totallynotTrace,i comonly use my laptop for homework on the go so I have to use my phone as a internet hotspot
01-05-2018T23:07:02,Bgrmystr2,"I don't, myself. Just use it for calls and texts. No need to get on the internet, would cost too damn much anyway"
01-05-2018T23:07:21,totallynotTrace,depends on how much your willing to spend
01-05-2018T23:08:21,Bgrmystr2,"Well, my father hosts my phone bill atm, it's not much for him and I don't really use any extra minutes, so it doesn't really cost him much of anything"
01-05-2018T23:08:32,totallynotTrace,ah
01-05-2018T23:08:48,Bgrmystr2,"I don't really call anyone outside the network very often, and when I do, it's not very long, and the texts are unlimited, so"
01-05-2018T23:08:58,Bgrmystr2,No big deal really
01-05-2018T23:09:02,Bgrmystr2,but internet would cost a lot
01-05-2018T23:09:20,totallynotTrace,ah
01-05-2018T23:09:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"I have a smartphone. Expensive but it works well, and I have a family plan with unlimited data and hotspot capability"
01-05-2018T23:09:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"For what I get, I find it to be worth it"
01-05-2018T23:09:54,totallynotTrace,yeah it wasnt until i was about to begin college i got a smartphone
01-05-2018T23:09:59,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, when you can't pay for it, you can't pay for it lol"
01-05-2018T23:10:27,totallynotTrace,and when you arnt the one paying for it you cant really beg.
01-05-2018T23:10:33,Bgrmystr2,yeh exactly
01-05-2018T23:10:36,totallynotTrace,I also have a familly plan
01-05-2018T23:10:44,totallynotTrace,not quite unlimited data
01-05-2018T23:11:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"iPhones are pricey, and I know for a fact that anything past the 6s is the same thing, but without the headphone jack and a slightly different camera"
01-05-2018T23:11:14,Bgrmystr2,well that's cuz it's apple
01-05-2018T23:11:17,Bgrmystr2,they overcharge everything
01-05-2018T23:11:51,Bgrmystr2,"paying for the name brand, not really for the tech inside it"
01-05-2018T23:11:51,totallynotTrace,but in the contract i have youtube doesnt count as data if i keep it 480p or lower
01-05-2018T23:11:59,totallynotTrace,I have lg
01-05-2018T23:12:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"I was supposed to get the 7, and that was when it was just coming out, but it got stolen en route to my home store"
01-05-2018T23:12:13,totallynotTrace,ah
01-05-2018T23:12:24,Bgrmystr2,rip
01-05-2018T23:12:26,SpazztasticKiwi,So I just got the 6s+
01-05-2018T23:12:56,Bgrmystr2,"did you not bother waiting for them to restock the 7? It's not like it was your fault, and the store would have had insurance on it anyway"
01-05-2018T23:13:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"Like I said, the 7 and 6 and all the others after are basically the same but with very minute differences"
01-05-2018T23:13:39,totallynotTrace,I bought my phone for $150 new. didnt look up press releases. the next day i whent back on the cariers website and they started carrying the next gen phone pluss it had a fingerprint sensor
01-05-2018T23:13:54,Bgrmystr2,lool
01-05-2018T23:14:02,Bgrmystr2,I don't want one of those at all XD
01-05-2018T23:14:10,SpazztasticKiwi,The only reason to wait and have them ship me another 7 would be to have the latest iPhone
01-05-2018T23:14:14,totallynotTrace,and it was on sale for $150
01-05-2018T23:14:35,Bgrmystr2,"cuz the phone saves that data, and anyone can easily jump into your phone and get that fingerprint. Phone security is garbage at best"
01-05-2018T23:15:16,Bgrmystr2,all sorts of red flags imo
01-05-2018T23:15:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"Yes it’s flashy to have the newest phone, but I need something I can use and like. My phone’s “outdated”, but it works and serves what I need well"
01-05-2018T23:15:36,totallynotTrace,yeah I used to like apple but then i began realizing how much I dont the the absolute latest prossesor
01-05-2018T23:16:04,Bgrmystr2,apple's products are unfortunately several years outdated technology advertised as brand new
01-05-2018T23:16:12,Bgrmystr2,so :/
01-05-2018T23:16:14,totallynotTrace,i left out some words in the last sentance XD
01-05-2018T23:16:20,Bgrmystr2,yeah you sure did lol
01-05-2018T23:16:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"Plus, I’ve dropped it too many times to count and it’s still alive"
01-05-2018T23:16:35,SpazztasticKiwi,No cracks
01-05-2018T23:16:49,totallynotTrace,UH UH UH UH STAYIN ALIVE STAYIN ALIVE
01-05-2018T23:16:55,SpazztasticKiwi,But I do have a screen protector and a case so
01-05-2018T23:17:32,totallynotTrace,my screen protector+case + belt clip came bundled for $9
01-05-2018T23:17:55,totallynotTrace,5 dollar shipping but still cheaper than anything i could get at best buy
01-05-2018T23:18:04,SpazztasticKiwi,At first I was looking at the Galaxy note phones but iPhone is what I ended up getting
01-05-2018T23:18:42,totallynotTrace,I want a fingerprint sensor just so people cant see my password
01-05-2018T23:18:48,totallynotTrace,over my shoulder
01-05-2018T23:18:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I have the fingerprint thing
01-05-2018T23:19:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I forgot which finger it’s programmed to
01-05-2018T23:19:18,totallynotTrace,good goin
01-05-2018T23:19:28,Bgrmystr2,xD I wouldn't have anything on my phone worth protecting anyway. Just a bad idea.
01-05-2018T23:19:49,totallynotTrace,apples secure chip is actually really hard to get into
01-05-2018T23:20:24,totallynotTrace,for the unlock password and fingerprint sensor that is
01-05-2018T23:20:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"Opening my phone you learn a few things about me: I’m a cat person, with two cats of my own, like art, and spend more time than what’s likely to be healthy on YouTube"
01-05-2018T23:21:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I can see in real time the battery usage each app I have takes
01-05-2018T23:21:15,totallynotTrace,oppen my phone you will learn 3 things:
01-05-2018T23:21:29,totallynotTrace,1:im a college student
01-05-2018T23:22:18,totallynotTrace,"2. I HAVE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF THE FINEST DANK MEMES STRAIGHT FROM IFUNNY ON MY CAMERA ROLL. COME GET YOUR FRESH, DANK MEMES"
01-05-2018T23:22:25,Bgrmystr2,xDD
01-05-2018T23:22:41,totallynotTrace,3. i have a seperate password for my bank info
01-05-2018T23:22:58,SpazztasticKiwi,That last one should be common sense
01-05-2018T23:23:58,SpazztasticKiwi,No one else knows any of my passwords. Not even my mom can use my phone
01-05-2018T23:24:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Not that she’d know how to work it anyway
01-05-2018T23:24:21,totallynotTrace,my parents could but thats cuz i told them
01-05-2018T23:25:06,totallynotTrace,my parents and i all use a similar OS so its easy for me to provide familly IT support
01-05-2018T23:25:31,totallynotTrace,but yeah the only thing i like about apple it their security
01-05-2018T23:25:37,totallynotTrace,thats it
01-05-2018T23:25:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"Give me an iPhone, I can help. Otherwise, I’ll be learning as I help"
01-05-2018T23:26:17,totallynotTrace,I had a 2nd and 5th gen ipod touch
01-05-2018T23:26:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I can work with Samsung phones. Have before
01-05-2018T23:26:36,totallynotTrace,samsung are android
01-05-2018T23:27:15,totallynotTrace,so its android but they may have put a different skin on it but when it comes down to it the os should be functionaly the same
01-05-2018T23:27:31,SpazztasticKiwi,An elderly guy wanted me to help him change his brightness. Wasn’t terribly hard
01-05-2018T23:27:51,totallynotTrace,good job
01-05-2018T23:28:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"I help my grandma a bit which her phone too, but don’t remember what it is"
01-05-2018T23:29:15,totallynotTrace,i have my grandparents tower computer right next to me right now
01-05-2018T23:29:22,totallynotTrace,*old tower
01-05-2018T23:29:32,totallynotTrace,they replaced it with a laptop
01-05-2018T23:29:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"My family seems to think I’m a tech wizard. I’m definitely not, but I’ll explore until I find what I’m looking for"
01-05-2018T23:29:51,totallynotTrace,same here
01-05-2018T23:30:12,totallynotTrace,"like im deffinately ""tech savvy"""
01-05-2018T23:30:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Another example is my grandma goes to bingo and one day she brought me to help her print some stuff off with the computers they had there
01-05-2018T23:30:36,unsteddyphoenix,Im pretty sure thats all it is
01-05-2018T23:30:41,unsteddyphoenix,The ability to google
01-05-2018T23:31:01,totallynotTrace,but they seem to think i can programm them and have every answer as to why a glitch happens
01-05-2018T23:31:09,SpazztasticKiwi,The internet wasn’t working and they were lost to what was wrong
01-05-2018T23:31:17,totallynotTrace,lol
01-05-2018T23:32:00,totallynotTrace,"so i have comcast phone, internet and tv"
01-05-2018T23:32:03,Bgrmystr2,"that's literally anyone though, not-trace"
01-05-2018T23:32:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"After running the built in diagnostic thing, I basically just hit refresh and booted it back up"
01-05-2018T23:32:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Hey thought I was magic
01-05-2018T23:32:20,Bgrmystr2,anyone who isn't a tech thinks techs know everythingggggg
01-05-2018T23:32:22,unsteddyphoenix,that thing has worked for me
01-05-2018T23:32:24,SpazztasticKiwi,*they
01-05-2018T23:32:28,unsteddyphoenix,Exactly 1 time

01-05-2018T23:32:53,unsteddyphoenix,Everybody gets one
01-05-2018T23:32:54,TheBeckoner,Hello hello mah peoples
01-05-2018T23:33:05,Bgrmystr2,hey Beck
01-05-2018T23:33:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Everyone’s running in like Tom’s about to stream
01-05-2018T23:33:41,SpazztasticKiwi,“Did I smell a conversation?”
01-05-2018T23:33:43,Bgrmystr2,not really? xD
01-05-2018T23:33:45,totallynotTrace,a few weeks ago phone internet and tv all whent down. my parents were yelling at me to fix it. I whent on the website and  told me that there was a service outage in my area.
01-05-2018T23:33:54,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, phoenix always lurks, and Beck comes in randomly"
01-05-2018T23:34:22,unsteddyphoenix,im always here
01-05-2018T23:34:24,unsteddyphoenix,except when im not
01-05-2018T23:34:33,Bgrmystr2,"""Fix it!"" &gt;Literally cannot do /anything/ to fix it."
01-05-2018T23:34:43,unsteddyphoenix,press fix button
01-05-2018T23:34:49,Bgrmystr2,xD I fucking wish
01-05-2018T23:34:59,SpazztasticKiwi,My mom likes to do that with me
01-05-2018T23:35:15,totallynotTrace,so I told my parents. they seemed to not accept that answer. 12 hours later I check the website. the site told me the outage was fixed and i needed to reset the router. suddenly I started getting thanked by my parents like I was a wizzard that saved them
01-05-2018T23:35:31,Bgrmystr2,&gt;.&gt;
01-05-2018T23:35:35,TheBeckoner,Im usually around here at 10:45 or later on closing shifts
01-05-2018T23:35:46,Bgrmystr2,"Some people are also not able to be fixed, not-trace"
01-05-2018T23:36:01,TheBeckoner,But Im semi random tbh
01-05-2018T23:36:02,totallynotTrace,also hi beck & phoenix
01-05-2018T23:36:07,TheBeckoner,heyo
01-05-2018T23:36:22,totallynotTrace,i just randomly check the stream whenever imm not busy
01-05-2018T23:36:47,Bgrmystr2,"I live here, so I have an excuse"
01-05-2018T23:36:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I pop in to see if there’s any interesting conversation going
01-05-2018T23:37:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Other than that I’m doing who knows what else
01-05-2018T23:37:25,totallynotTrace,you live here? like that tiger sleeping over there&lt;?
01-05-2018T23:37:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I did catch up some YT though
01-05-2018T23:37:59,TheBeckoner,Nah Bgr is a ghost

01-05-2018T23:38:52,Bgrmystr2,haha I just roll with whatever.
01-05-2018T23:39:24,Bgrmystr2,"I died a long, long time ago in a chat not too far away from here.. in a war that noone speaks of anymore."
01-05-2018T23:39:45,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
01-05-2018T23:39:49,totallynotTrace,:ptv-shock:
01-05-2018T23:41:45,TheBeckoner,I am chat beb so I have no clue if thats a reference
01-05-2018T23:41:55,TheBeckoner,well
01-05-2018T23:41:57,TheBeckoner,I mean
01-05-2018T23:42:01,TheBeckoner,star wars?
01-05-2018T23:42:06,unsteddyphoenix,Its potentially the dumbest reference possible
01-05-2018T23:42:06,TheBeckoner,but otherwise
01-05-2018T23:42:14,unsteddyphoenix,:ramen:
01-05-2018T23:42:23,TheBeckoner,is that soup?
01-05-2018T23:42:36,TheBeckoner,oh
01-05-2018T23:42:38,TheBeckoner,ramen
01-05-2018T23:42:46,Bgrmystr2,"haha, phoenix, a veteran"
01-05-2018T23:43:04,totallynotTrace,I heard its a delicacy here on earth
01-05-2018T23:43:25,TheBeckoner,Phoenix youre pre Picarto yeah?
01-05-2018T23:43:55,Bgrmystr2,yeah he is
01-05-2018T23:44:03,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh like ustream, yeah"
01-05-2018T23:44:42,unsteddyphoenix,Once I get really into something I never seem to let go
01-05-2018T23:44:50,unsteddyphoenix,i guess
01-05-2018T23:46:37,TheBeckoner,Well that can be a good thing. Just never acquire an affinity for cactus.
01-05-2018T23:46:52,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
01-05-2018T23:46:57,unsteddyphoenix,dont kinkshame
01-05-2018T23:47:00,totallynotTrace,or puffer fish
01-05-2018T23:47:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Do you throw yourself into everything you do?
01-05-2018T23:47:58,TheBeckoner,"We don't kinkshame, no~"
01-05-2018T23:48:17,totallynotTrace,this is the only screen i have open
01-05-2018T23:48:26,totallynotTrace,so it kinda has my attention
01-05-2018T23:48:33,totallynotTrace,other than spotify that is
01-05-2018T23:48:36,unsteddyphoenix,"Sadly, not really. Only the things I really enjoy"
01-05-2018T23:49:00,unsteddyphoenix,Otherwise I have to force myself to stay interested
01-05-2018T23:49:08,unsteddyphoenix,It's never anything practical sadly~
01-05-2018T23:49:13,TheBeckoner,Im about that way.
01-05-2018T23:49:27,TheBeckoner,Im really into cars which is semi useful sometimes
01-05-2018T23:49:41,unsteddyphoenix,nice
01-05-2018T23:49:56,unsteddyphoenix,that has some use
01-05-2018T23:50:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I get interested in the most random useless stuff sometimes
01-05-2018T23:50:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Particularly if it’s art facts
01-05-2018T23:50:28,totallynotTrace,i like nice cars. If only i could afford any of the ones i like XD
01-05-2018T23:50:35,totallynotTrace,ok im leavin now

01-05-2018T23:52:46,unsteddyphoenix,I think he's fine
01-05-2018T23:52:51,TheBeckoner,Phoenix is correct
01-05-2018T23:53:11,TheBeckoner,the better wheather mod makes the sun brighter and therefore my monitor
01-05-2018T23:53:12,TheBeckoner,so

01-05-2018T23:53:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"Yes, but the sun provides essential energy for the production of necessary vitamins"
01-05-2018T23:53:40,unsteddyphoenix,Eh so do drugs
01-05-2018T23:53:41,TheBeckoner,Now everyone knows thats government propaganda
01-05-2018T23:53:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Not to mention it makes you look less like a pale nightmare
01-05-2018T23:53:57,TheBeckoner,Multivitamin yo

01-05-2018T23:55:11,TheBeckoner,Gotta call Tom in now
01-05-2018T23:55:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Mainly because my thighs expand to the appropriate size of Russia when I sit down so I don’t show them often
01-05-2018T23:56:11,unsteddyphoenix,awh
01-05-2018T23:56:22,unsteddyphoenix,"""thicc"" is popular nowadays!"

01-05-2018T23:58:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t believe Tom’s on rn. He said he mowed the lawn this morning tho
01-05-2018T23:59:08,TheBeckoner,He may be terribly sunburnt at this point
01-05-2018T23:59:27,unsteddyphoenix,nice
01-05-2018T23:59:28,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-KatDance:
01-05-2018T23:59:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe just his arms. His hair should protect his neck and shoulders
