27-04-2018T00:43:37,Bgrmystr2,"there has to be more than one type of bird, right?"
27-04-2018T00:43:41,SageSaga,for this world any permanent flight is an issue
27-04-2018T00:43:42,Watsup,no fluffs allowed

27-04-2018T00:46:29,SageSaga,Flying worked well in the Storm Kings Thunder game- it wasnt an issue- nor was it a detriment - in this one there will be more dungeon crawls so sometimes flying is just gonna be useless
27-04-2018T00:46:36,unsteddyphoenix,Would saria wear a see-through shirt?
27-04-2018T00:46:41,thestooge,Nice butt shading!

27-04-2018T00:46:47,Dadrobit,Yes unsteddy.
27-04-2018T00:46:48,ItsActuallyKopyKat,She would for trace :3

27-04-2018T00:46:54,SageSaga,and other times it will break the point of some areas being hard to get to
27-04-2018T00:46:59,Dadrobit,If she actually loved Trace that is.
27-04-2018T00:47:00,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah ofc

27-04-2018T00:47:22,SageSaga,so Sunblaze
27-04-2018T00:47:32,unsteddyphoenix,Defintely shouldnt be a racial trait for a reg dnd game
27-04-2018T00:47:40,DRAGONTANOPUG,Wtf happen to the necklace that trace gave flora?
27-04-2018T00:47:42,Dadrobit,"It's Keidran fitted, so maybe Rose wore it for her?"

27-04-2018T00:49:24,ItsActuallyKopyKat,I could properly convey the level of shading
27-04-2018T00:49:24,Vatruvius,That is a very high rating KopyKat.
27-04-2018T00:49:29,RH0DE,0-0
27-04-2018T00:50:24,Justanotheruser7118,who here could actually draw something after watching the streams?
27-04-2018T00:50:32,Vatruvius,"Ugh...I can just imagine how long it will be to draw my few comic pages that came to me yesterday. Many, many weeks of refining. Should be fun though once I get to the end."
27-04-2018T00:50:45,Alphawolf333,you don't need zeros just go into scientific notation
27-04-2018T00:50:50,Vatruvius,"With practice, I could Just."
27-04-2018T00:50:51,Dadrobit,Something is rather vague no?

27-04-2018T00:51:34,Vatruvius,Name expresses what I am thinking now General.
27-04-2018T00:51:59,Dadrobit,Completely relevent if you're actually watching the stream properly.
27-04-2018T00:52:11,Vatruvius,"Wait, which stream?"

27-04-2018T00:52:28,Bgrmystr2,there's the problem
27-04-2018T00:52:37,Dadrobit,So you're the irrellivant one then.\

27-04-2018T00:53:44,Vatruvius,A good day for me means one stream with no interuptions.
27-04-2018T00:54:02,Ordithus,130 b/s?!  That's about morse code levels
27-04-2018T00:54:35,Vatruvius,Not Morse code levels Ord.
27-04-2018T00:54:41,Bgrmystr2,erh.. that's 16 bytes per second

27-04-2018T01:23:09,unsteddyphoenix,"""im the one good drow out of all the evil ones and also the chosen one"" type deal"
27-04-2018T01:23:11,SageSaga,they arent jokes but it is a trope to make brooding dark elves

27-04-2018T01:25:28,Bgrmystr2,haha
27-04-2018T01:25:54,SageSaga,Males of lower families are often forced to work as Guards or warriors regardless of skill

27-04-2018T02:00:48,unsteddyphoenix,And by horrible I mean a masterpiece
27-04-2018T02:00:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Eh. That depends on preference
27-04-2018T02:00:50,TheBeckoner,or that
27-04-2018T02:00:54,SageSaga,both would be 30 dollars
27-04-2018T02:00:54,BadFoMo,What will you not draw?
27-04-2018T02:00:56,Bgrmystr2,Lol sage.. sounds like phoenix's question was lost in translation XD

27-04-2018T02:01:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Hot to you guys isn‚Äôt necessarily hot to me
27-04-2018T02:01:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,What about Kratos Sage
27-04-2018T02:02:00,SageSaga,i would draw Kratos for 20 bucks
27-04-2018T02:02:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,with the beard and boy speech bubble?
27-04-2018T02:02:21,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs a pretty cool dude. Doesn‚Äôt seem to have the best of luck with wives though
27-04-2018T02:02:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Not terrible looking though
27-04-2018T02:02:59,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah the wives...thats pretty unlucky
27-04-2018T02:02:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yeah he's kinda wearing his first wife
27-04-2018T02:03:14,SageSaga,he's had kids so cant say he hasnt been a lil' lucky
27-04-2018T02:03:22,unsteddyphoenix,Can you imagine more potential baggage than wearing your last wife and kid on your body
27-04-2018T02:03:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,wearing his first kid too
27-04-2018T02:03:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôd say maybe that‚Äôs why the wives died, but that might be too much"
27-04-2018T02:03:42,unsteddyphoenix,I mean Kratos has a 3 way in like every game
27-04-2018T02:03:48,unsteddyphoenix,Thats a bit lucky
27-04-2018T02:04:01,unsteddyphoenix,Well im pretty sure he murdered the first one in a rrage so
27-04-2018T02:04:11,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah thats just unfortunate
27-04-2018T02:04:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"except one of those was with his sister, so.......... umm, yeah"
27-04-2018T02:04:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Feel like I might want to go for a more artsy type than a war lord
27-04-2018T02:04:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Or war god
27-04-2018T02:04:35,unsteddyphoenix,That seems like a good call

27-04-2018T02:23:29,unsteddyphoenix,Lol. Good luck
27-04-2018T02:24:35,SageSaga,looks like its well put together but also doesnt look official
27-04-2018T02:25:54,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, I wasnt sure how official it was, mainly 'cause there was no hype around it"
27-04-2018T02:26:06,unsteddyphoenix,But it LOOKS official so...?
27-04-2018T02:26:19,SageSaga,but it isnt-
27-04-2018T02:26:20,SageSaga,so
27-04-2018T02:26:48,Mihari,There is also a lot of errors
27-04-2018T02:26:51,Mihari,typos and the like
27-04-2018T02:27:09,FluffKevlar,how can you tell if official or not?
27-04-2018T02:27:24,SageSaga,well for one thing- its not sold by Wizards of the Coast
27-04-2018T02:27:38,SageSaga,and the creators arent listed as working on it- and ive never heard of it till now-
27-04-2018T02:28:00,SageSaga,and the assets are all taken from other books
27-04-2018T02:28:01,Bgrmystr2,I found a podcast with the same name
27-04-2018T02:28:09,Bgrmystr2,perhaps maybe that's where it came from?
27-04-2018T02:28:13,SageSaga,but it says why got permission to use the assets-
27-04-2018T02:28:21,Bgrmystr2,it's on the wizards website
27-04-2018T02:28:27,SageSaga,it says they got permission*
27-04-2018T02:28:30,unsteddyphoenix,hmm~
27-04-2018T02:31:15,SageSaga,yeah its not official but it is made with their permission
27-04-2018T02:31:39,unsteddyphoenix,I see.
27-04-2018T02:32:01,unsteddyphoenix,What I read didnt seem too outlandish in regards to balancing?
27-04-2018T02:32:05,SageSaga,this is how Pathfinder started
27-04-2018T02:32:17,unsteddyphoenix,No more than xanxathars at least
27-04-2018T02:32:18,SageSaga,i would have to personally read the entire thing before allowing it
27-04-2018T02:32:37,SageSaga,that said i can do that in like an hour so-
27-04-2018T02:32:46,unsteddyphoenix,Hoho~ impressive
27-04-2018T02:33:53,SageSaga,i used to carry the core books and the supplements in my backpack to school every day along with my school books through middleschool and highschool - i am well versed in reading DnD manuals
27-04-2018T02:34:32,unsteddyphoenix,Good god
27-04-2018T02:34:40,unsteddyphoenix,"Did you wear a shirt that said ""kick me"" as well?"
27-04-2018T02:35:00,Bgrmystr2,xD
27-04-2018T02:35:15,Bgrmystr2,no that was only the notebook paper stuck on the back of his shirt with tape
27-04-2018T02:35:21,Bgrmystr2,so he couldn't see it
27-04-2018T02:35:21,SageSaga,no - people  mostly stopped messing with me when i made friends with the Punk kids
27-04-2018T02:35:23,unsteddyphoenix,Having the physical books is really nice~ dealing with those pdfs can be nightmarish
27-04-2018T02:35:37,unsteddyphoenix,I figured he was saving the bullies some trouble bgr
27-04-2018T02:35:44,SageSaga,you know- the actually threatening goth looking folk
27-04-2018T02:35:53,Bgrmystr2,yeah but that'd cost money phoenix :c
27-04-2018T02:35:59,unsteddyphoenix,DID they shop at hot topic?
27-04-2018T02:36:09,SageSaga,PDFs didnt exist back then
27-04-2018T02:36:16,Bgrmystr2,hahaha
27-04-2018T02:36:20,SageSaga,Tablets didnt exist back then-
27-04-2018T02:36:24,Bgrmystr2,"""PDFs"""
27-04-2018T02:36:41,SageSaga,downloads took hours to days
27-04-2018T02:36:45,unsteddyphoenix,implying I dont use my big dumb bulky laptop to play~
27-04-2018T02:37:03,unsteddyphoenix,My friends have copies though so luckily I can use theirs~
27-04-2018T02:53:04,SageSaga,"i was watching a stream earlier and i brought up the story about how i learned not german from a ""teacher"" back in High school when i broke my foot and ankle-"
27-04-2018T02:53:42,unsteddyphoenix,not german?
27-04-2018T02:53:46,SageSaga,"and the streamer was like ""Is your ankle better?"" and im like ""Uhh- im over 30... that was in high school- so yes"""
27-04-2018T02:54:06,Bgrmystr2,hahaha
27-04-2018T02:54:22,Bgrmystr2,"but sage, your ankle may still be broken and you don't know it!"
27-04-2018T02:54:27,Bgrmystr2,are you sure it's better?
27-04-2018T02:54:36,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe you were just held back in highschool for a loooong time
27-04-2018T02:54:36,SageSaga,"i was taking German and when i broke my foot i had to have a home tutor and the one i had said he spoke german- when i got back to classes my german teacher was like ""ok- none of that is german"""
27-04-2018T02:54:57,unsteddyphoenix,LOL
27-04-2018T02:55:21,unsteddyphoenix,Thats pretty funny
27-04-2018T02:55:24,SageSaga,and suggested i not continue german because i would basically have to retake German 1 to be able to keep up with German 2
27-04-2018T02:55:42,unsteddyphoenix,It was actually detrimental oof
27-04-2018T02:55:48,SageSaga,i still passed German 1 but not by my amazing german skills
27-04-2018T02:56:09,unsteddyphoenix,Theres other ways to pass?
27-04-2018T02:56:22,SageSaga,doing all the work
27-04-2018T02:56:51,SageSaga,if you just do all the work and barely pass the tests you still pass-
27-04-2018T02:56:54,unsteddyphoenix,Passed german without learning german. Schooling system at its finest
27-04-2018T02:56:58,SageSaga,and somehow i still passed with a B
27-04-2018T02:57:14,SageSaga,oh but this is the best part-
27-04-2018T02:57:34,SageSaga,then i went into Spanish- i wasnt good but i drew an awesome Santa Clause - life size for the teachers door
27-04-2018T02:58:15,SageSaga,saw the teacher last week too- she said she still has my Santa clause door decoration
27-04-2018T02:58:20,unsteddyphoenix,Thats....thats just a bribe.
27-04-2018T02:58:31,SageSaga,yep
27-04-2018T02:58:42,Bgrmystr2,lol damn
27-04-2018T02:58:47,unsteddyphoenix,"Well hey, 'least you learnt a real world skill~"
27-04-2018T02:59:12,Bgrmystr2,did you ever figure out what language you were taugh when your ankle was broken?
27-04-2018T02:59:15,SageSaga,then Spanish 2 - i had a teacher that rather talk about how he almost dated Natalie Portman than teach us Spanish
27-04-2018T02:59:23,Bgrmystr2,taught*
27-04-2018T02:59:47,SageSaga,"nope - perhaps one day when we are invaded by aliens i will hear them and say ""Ive got this guys- I know their language"""
27-04-2018T02:59:57,Bgrmystr2,XD
27-04-2018T03:00:05,SageSaga,and i will tell them- Happy Birthday

27-04-2018T03:00:08,Bgrmystr2,do you remember ANY of it?
27-04-2018T03:00:17,unsteddyphoenix,You will ask them where the bathroom is!
27-04-2018T03:00:25,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, the internet's at your fingertips at this point"
27-04-2018T03:00:31,Bgrmystr2,it could probably identify it for you
27-04-2018T03:00:39,Bgrmystr2,unless it was entirely jibberish

27-04-2018T03:03:21,unsteddyphoenix,Heh. My friends in highschool used to bug me about italian words all the time. My italian isnt perfect so whenever theyd ask me a word I didnt know i'd just lie.

27-04-2018T03:09:10,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. would it really have changed anything?
27-04-2018T03:09:31,Bgrmystr2,would you have done somethin different with your life if you did end up learning german instead of whatever you went with?
27-04-2018T03:09:53,SageSaga,the plan was to become Fluent in german - so probably
27-04-2018T03:10:05,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: huh
27-04-2018T03:10:33,Bgrmystr2,what would you have done.. ya think?
27-04-2018T03:10:55,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I can understand learning another language, but not sure how that would affect job aspects"

27-04-2018T03:17:57,SageSaga,Valentines day
27-04-2018T03:18:28,SageSaga,im thinking Felix wants them to hook up even though they arent in the same universe- or even reality if they were-
27-04-2018T03:18:33,Bgrmystr2,haha

27-04-2018T03:20:47,Bgrmystr2,"might have missed it for some reason or another, I have a pretty damn good memory for images I've seen before"
27-04-2018T03:20:49,SageSaga,i think i sketched and inked it in January and colored it for Feb
27-04-2018T03:21:15,Bgrmystr2,"been a bit, so xD who knows"
27-04-2018T03:22:43,Bgrmystr2,"gonna run and get some food, you gonna be done in the next 5 mins or so?"

27-04-2018T03:28:22,FluffKevlar,"albeit drow adventurers are rare, it says"
27-04-2018T03:28:23,SageSaga,yep
27-04-2018T03:28:37,SageSaga,you are probably gonna need sunglasses though
27-04-2018T03:28:50,FluffKevlar,"it doesnt say they know undercommon, but i would assume they do?"
27-04-2018T03:28:53,Bgrmystr2,:dark_sunglasses:

27-04-2018T03:30:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I might be crazy but not that crazy
27-04-2018T03:31:04,SageSaga,Fluff- You can swap one of your starting languages (other than Common) with Undercommon if you want
27-04-2018T03:31:22,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-uneasy: don't do me this marv lol
27-04-2018T03:31:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol

27-04-2018T03:44:27,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: gnight
27-04-2018T03:44:38,BadFoMo,Good night.
27-04-2018T03:44:53,Bgrmystr2,"for some reason, sage, her face looks a bit like one of the characters from one of the zelda games"
27-04-2018T03:45:09,Bgrmystr2,"I wouldn't be able to point it out, cuz I don't recall who"
27-04-2018T03:45:50,Bgrmystr2,"has that kinda feel though, nostalgic somewhat, even though I never played any of the games myself"
27-04-2018T03:46:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,windwaker?
27-04-2018T03:46:22,SageSaga,its probably the main character. Zelda :csagesaga-nynasmirk:
27-04-2018T03:47:04,Bgrmystr2,yah.. course. It is Zelda that lil green has to run around and save
27-04-2018T03:47:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,dende?
27-04-2018T03:47:34,Bgrmystr2,"yknow, when he's not too busy HAPP HWUP HUP at pots in other people's houses.."
27-04-2018T03:47:46,FluffKevlar,why cant metroid crawl?
27-04-2018T03:47:47,Bgrmystr2,and stealing the money inside em
27-04-2018T03:47:51,Bgrmystr2,lolol
27-04-2018T03:47:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,xD
27-04-2018T03:48:21,Bgrmystr2,"That's the guy in the suit, yes floof. Clearly cannot crawl :vvvvvv"
27-04-2018T03:48:28,SageSaga,"the armor isnt flexible enough - ""Then how does she turn into a ball?"""
27-04-2018T03:48:42,BadFoMo,PFM?
27-04-2018T03:48:51,FluffKevlar,i miss metroid prime
27-04-2018T03:49:00,FluffKevlar,i want my wii back with some GC games
27-04-2018T03:49:14,Bgrmystr2,lol I love all those game name memes
27-04-2018T03:49:17,BadFoMo,GC?
27-04-2018T03:49:24,SageSaga,i would send you mine Fluff but-
27-04-2018T03:49:27,FluffKevlar,gamecube
27-04-2018T03:49:33,BadFoMo,Thank you.
27-04-2018T03:50:01,SageSaga,like every console I have owned other than my current PS4 Pro and switch- my brother took it and either sold it or broke it
27-04-2018T03:50:10,FluffKevlar,"zelda master quest and metroid prime, i regret getting rid of my wii cause it could play gc titles. IIRC some later Wii models can't"
27-04-2018T03:50:12,FluffKevlar,"aw, dang"
27-04-2018T03:50:26,Bgrmystr2,"that's super uncalled for, sage :/"
27-04-2018T03:50:29,Bgrmystr2,unfortunate
27-04-2018T03:50:41,BadFoMo,That sucks.
27-04-2018T03:51:48,FluffKevlar,"i think i have him all set up, except for alignment.. idk, i always find that hardest, even with personality in mind"
27-04-2018T03:52:11,Mihari,What's their personality?
27-04-2018T03:52:24,unsteddyphoenix,Ho~ still going nice
27-04-2018T03:52:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,wb sebply
27-04-2018T03:53:23,unsteddyphoenix,Do drow get disadvantage in sunlight?
27-04-2018T03:53:40,Mihari,Yes
27-04-2018T03:53:42,SageSaga,i was thinking about Tom's super hero character and how even though he was technically human- he was seen as totally not human to the point that he really couldnt be normal
27-04-2018T03:53:59,FluffKevlar,"a studious drow determined for knowledge and skill, probably more of a neutral/chaotic by nature, but the fey patron pushes him more toward's good/lawful begrudgingly"
27-04-2018T03:54:27,SageSaga,"i just imagine how he was born ""Ok ma'am - push! Eww! What is this? Ewww- ok where's the baby? . . .  Uhhhhh-"""
27-04-2018T03:54:29,FluffKevlar,"somewhat reluctant, jaded, but not dark and emo. more self-determined"
27-04-2018T03:54:45,FluffKevlar,haha
27-04-2018T03:54:57,SageSaga,Fey isnt lawful bro
27-04-2018T03:55:50,Mihari,Chaotic Good or Neutral
27-04-2018T03:56:02,Mihari,More like Neutral
27-04-2018T03:56:12,Mihari,Given the drow and fey
27-04-2018T03:56:28,FluffKevlar,"er, yeah chaotic"
27-04-2018T03:56:29,SageSaga,"their only existing ""government"" is but for the most part- Neutral or chaotic- not often evil"
27-04-2018T03:57:02,SageSaga,Titania is one of the only lawful ones and thats a stretch considering she makes the laws -
27-04-2018T03:57:13,Mihari,Could just go Neutral period too XD
27-04-2018T03:57:42,SageSaga,who or what did you make a pact with?
27-04-2018T03:58:03,Mihari,Oh yah! Warlock
27-04-2018T03:58:08,Mihari,That makes difference too
27-04-2018T03:58:22,FluffKevlar,Sarula
27-04-2018T03:58:32,SageSaga,i love warlock for the whole pact aspect for character creation
27-04-2018T03:59:08,SageSaga,you made a pact with a lesser Deity?
27-04-2018T03:59:26,FluffKevlar,the archfey?
27-04-2018T03:59:35,unsteddyphoenix,If the deity's chaotic good...
27-04-2018T03:59:43,Mihari,http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Sarula_Iliene
27-04-2018T03:59:46,SageSaga,uhm no shes a lesser diety of the elves
27-04-2018T04:00:41,SageSaga,i suggest something smaller- maybe something under her and as your pact grows you can make deals with more powerful fey to gather more power
27-04-2018T04:00:48,DarthRexKing,I am going to bed. Later!
27-04-2018T04:00:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Darth
27-04-2018T04:01:06,unsteddyphoenix,Is that really important sage?
27-04-2018T04:01:07,DarthRexKing,night night.
27-04-2018T04:01:17,FluffKevlar,i dont know how to find all this out
27-04-2018T04:01:22,FluffKevlar,the information is all over the place
27-04-2018T04:01:34,FluffKevlar,"im looking in the guidebook, wikis, forums"
27-04-2018T04:01:37,SageSaga,is it important- no not really- but its helpful for character building
27-04-2018T04:02:01,FluffKevlar,"i cant find a 1: list of all archfey, 2: what they do/stand for/act like"
27-04-2018T04:02:02,unsteddyphoenix,So like...as he progresses he'd change his pact?
27-04-2018T04:02:03,SageSaga,well shes called the Nixie queen
27-04-2018T04:02:10,Mihari,Kinda like how Aerie's obsession became her power source
27-04-2018T04:02:25,SageSaga,so why not make a pact with a colony of Nixies?
27-04-2018T04:03:42,SageSaga,Nixies are just aquatic Pixies
27-04-2018T04:04:21,Mihari,Or Anthro Seal Artists
27-04-2018T04:04:28,FluffKevlar,haaa
27-04-2018T04:04:42,Bgrmystr2,sounds like a mess
27-04-2018T04:04:49,SageSaga,see using that information you can build a story- like you escaped the underdark only to fall into a lake on the surface unable to swim you began to drown when a group of Nixies saved you
27-04-2018T04:06:06,SageSaga,that's how i write stories and come up with characters at least
27-04-2018T04:06:18,FluffKevlar,hrm
27-04-2018T04:06:32,unsteddyphoenix,got blinded by the sunlight and fell in lol
27-04-2018T04:06:47,unsteddyphoenix,I could see that honestly
27-04-2018T04:06:48,Bgrmystr2,"blinded by the light, eh? :u"
27-04-2018T04:06:58,SageSaga,or got vertigo looking into the reflection of the sky and moon in the still water
27-04-2018T04:07:11,unsteddyphoenix,"""aaa there's no ceiling"""
27-04-2018T04:07:17,Bgrmystr2,xD
27-04-2018T04:07:29,SageSaga,no ceiling and no floor if you have never seen a reflected sky before
27-04-2018T04:07:38,FluffKevlar,what's the arcane focus' purpose?
27-04-2018T04:07:55,SageSaga,you channel your spells through a focus
27-04-2018T04:07:57,unsteddyphoenix,"You cast spells through it, like a wand."
27-04-2018T04:08:04,SageSaga,like a Wizard uses a wand in Harry Potter
27-04-2018T04:08:14,SageSaga,(wands are a focus!)
27-04-2018T04:08:32,SageSaga,without a focus or components you cannot cast spells
27-04-2018T04:09:05,SageSaga,"i remember being in a jail cell and being like ""I got it! I'll cast- crap they took my pouch- wait! Is there a spider in the cell?"""
27-04-2018T04:09:15,SageSaga,"Uhh- yeah? ""Cool- I eat it"""
27-04-2018T04:09:28,SageSaga,TO CAST SPIDER CLIMB!
27-04-2018T04:09:36,FluffKevlar,haha
27-04-2018T04:09:55,unsteddyphoenix,oof components are so complicated
27-04-2018T04:09:58,SageSaga,crawled up on the ceiling when the guards passed- they freaked out and opened the cell to search it- and i dropped ontop of em
27-04-2018T04:10:53,SageSaga,"another great example of a focus you know Fluff- ""I told you to take the wizards staff!!!!!"""
27-04-2018T04:10:54,BadFoMo,...For what were you jailed?
27-04-2018T04:11:15,SageSaga,whole group was jailed for causing a bar fight
27-04-2018T04:11:20,BadFoMo,Oh.
27-04-2018T04:11:50,unsteddyphoenix,"Lol, ive been in that exact situation"
27-04-2018T04:11:54,SageSaga,in the fight we found out the mayors butler was a werewolf and it was a full moon so we had to break out and save em
27-04-2018T04:12:12,SageSaga,we didnt save him... but we did loot his house and run
27-04-2018T04:12:29,Bgrmystr2,hahaha sage the reaction of the guards when you jumped them from the ceiling would have been brilliant
27-04-2018T04:12:33,sunblaze,yeah clearly a matter of priotities :D
27-04-2018T04:12:37,Mihari,"Or that time we boarded that boat in the game before last, I was the only one able to do anything because my focus was a new necklace that was made out of that gem I got that detects dragons."
27-04-2018T04:12:53,Xexanoth,classic murderhoboing
27-04-2018T04:13:08,BadFoMo,I probably shouldn't be laughing at that.
27-04-2018T04:13:11,Xexanoth,as long as you get to loot you were succesfull
27-04-2018T04:13:30,SageSaga,hey  i was the only one to come up with a way out of the jail! the rogue didnt put a lock pick in his boot! what kinda rogue doesnt keep a lockpick in his boot?!
27-04-2018T04:13:46,Bgrmystr2,xD
27-04-2018T04:13:55,Bgrmystr2,poor guards
27-04-2018T04:13:57,SageSaga,it is not easy for a halfling wizard to beat up 2 guards with physical attacks!
27-04-2018T04:14:23,Bgrmystr2,they signed up for guarding prisoners.. not getting jumped by spider-motherfuckers..
27-04-2018T04:14:31,SageSaga,i did bluff that all i needed was a lantern as a material component for my fireball
27-04-2018T04:14:39,SageSaga,it didnt work and they kicked me in the head
27-04-2018T04:14:56,Bgrmystr2,hahaha
27-04-2018T04:15:12,unsteddyphoenix,"Wizards, masters of persuasion"
27-04-2018T04:15:15,Bgrmystr2,that's gret though
27-04-2018T04:15:29,SageSaga,i also played in a game where i was a Half Celestial Monk
27-04-2018T04:15:35,Bgrmystr2,great* even
27-04-2018T04:16:02,SageSaga,Lanthalos the Fist of Light... eaten by a Dire Bear...
27-04-2018T04:16:15,SageSaga,Who puts a dire bear in a level 1 encounter?!
27-04-2018T04:16:40,Xexanoth,someone who wants to kill your characters?
27-04-2018T04:16:53,unsteddyphoenix,You were probably supposed to run
27-04-2018T04:16:58,SageSaga,he swears to this day he thought they were CR2
27-04-2018T04:17:08,BadFoMo,CR2?
27-04-2018T04:17:23,SageSaga,Challenge Rating
27-04-2018T04:17:30,BadFoMo,Thank you.
27-04-2018T04:17:31,unsteddyphoenix,basically how strong a monster is
27-04-2018T04:17:49,Bgrmystr2,what are they actually/
27-04-2018T04:17:50,Bgrmystr2,?
27-04-2018T04:18:02,Xexanoth,he propably confused a bear with a dire bear
27-04-2018T04:18:10,SageSaga,7!!!!
27-04-2018T04:18:27,sunblaze,dire bear = bear the size of a SUV all teeth and claws :D
27-04-2018T04:18:35,SageSaga,And there were TWO OF THEM
27-04-2018T04:18:54,Xexanoth,did he not look at their HP and nthe damage they do and thought *hmm something seems off*
27-04-2018T04:18:55,Bgrmystr2,"that.. doesn't sound that bad, but I'll assume that each level is extremely significant considering the context of your unhappiness of their presence."
27-04-2018T04:19:06,SageSaga,they have +19 to hit!
27-04-2018T04:19:10,SageSaga,on a D20!
27-04-2018T04:19:16,unsteddyphoenix,"""Hm this bear does 12D8 damage on average...I think some level ones can deal with it"""
27-04-2018T04:19:18,SageSaga,1d20+19!!!
27-04-2018T04:19:35,Xexanoth,pff easy :ptv-SteelwormHades:
27-04-2018T04:19:50,SageSaga,my ac was really high too - at like 18!
27-04-2018T04:20:16,Bgrmystr2,"did they destroy you guys, sage?"
27-04-2018T04:20:43,SageSaga,i died instantly - the rest tried to run- but they were blocked in
27-04-2018T04:20:54,unsteddyphoenix,Oh. Lol. So you couldnt escape
27-04-2018T04:21:02,Bgrmystr2,aw shit
27-04-2018T04:21:18,Xexanoth,"well, at that point the gm probably just killed of anyone so they could restart"
27-04-2018T04:21:21,Bgrmystr2,RIP run :urn:
27-04-2018T04:21:29,SageSaga,"we stopped after i died though and i was like ""Dude- Dire Bears are CR7 creatures!"" and he was like ""No they arent! . . . Wow they have over 100 HP"""
27-04-2018T04:21:43,Xexanoth,"""and then you all awake screaming from the same nightmare"""
27-04-2018T04:21:53,SageSaga,"""I have 9 HP!"" ""You HAD 9 HP - now you have- -12"""
27-04-2018T04:21:58,unsteddyphoenix,Theres no way he didnt realise
27-04-2018T04:22:10,unsteddyphoenix,You mustve pissed him off somehow
27-04-2018T04:22:18,Xexanoth,or he was new at gming DnD
27-04-2018T04:22:29,Mihari,I'm sure he didn't based on what I've heard of his D&D RL friends XD
27-04-2018T04:23:21,unsteddyphoenix,Surely when he saw how many dice he was rolling...
27-04-2018T04:24:22,unsteddyphoenix,+19! How does that not tip you off!
27-04-2018T04:24:45,SageSaga,i remembered wrong
27-04-2018T04:25:01,SageSaga,it was +19 to grapple- which it gets to do automatically after a hit
27-04-2018T04:25:04,unsteddyphoenix,oh heres the truth
27-04-2018T04:25:19,SageSaga,so it hit me - grabbed me - and bit my head off
27-04-2018T04:25:33,BadFoMo,"+19 means you need to roll 19 or higher to win, right?"
27-04-2018T04:25:51,Xexanoth,"nope, it means he adds +19 to whatever he rolled"
27-04-2018T04:25:53,SageSaga,+19 means when he rolls his Str check to grapple he gets 1d20+19
27-04-2018T04:26:02,unsteddyphoenix,"It's very very likely for the bear to hit, basically"
27-04-2018T04:26:03,SageSaga,i get 1d20 plus my bonus... a 4
27-04-2018T04:26:47,BadFoMo,...Wow. You were hosed.
27-04-2018T04:27:24,unsteddyphoenix,+4 to hit and 18 ac? fighters...
27-04-2018T04:28:11,SageSaga,Monk
27-04-2018T04:28:17,Bgrmystr2,"this is all entirely greek to me so, I'm just gonna sit here silently. :ptv-uneasy:"
27-04-2018T04:28:39,unsteddyphoenix,How does a monk have that much AC? They dont wear armour
27-04-2018T04:28:51,SageSaga,they get both Dex and Wisdom bonus to their AX
27-04-2018T04:28:53,SageSaga,AC*
27-04-2018T04:28:58,Xexanoth,"just learn dnd, and then you can talk with us BGR"
27-04-2018T04:29:07,unsteddyphoenix,Your stats mustve been  bonkers
27-04-2018T04:29:12,Bgrmystr2,"I never got interested in it, xex lol"
27-04-2018T04:29:14,SageSaga,when you have +4 Dex and +4 Wisdom you have 18
27-04-2018T04:29:27,SageSaga,half celestial gives a lot of unfair bonuses
27-04-2018T04:29:32,unsteddyphoenix,"damn, so for the record, sages character was really strong."
27-04-2018T04:29:40,SageSaga,but not a Direbear level of unfairness
27-04-2018T04:29:55,Bgrmystr2,haha not strong enough
27-04-2018T04:29:56,SageSaga,had wings too
27-04-2018T04:30:08,ZRO4825,o.o;
27-04-2018T04:30:09,Xexanoth,pen and paper rpgs are pretty fun @BGr you should try it
27-04-2018T04:30:10,SageSaga,was gonna fly away but - Lawful Good- couldnt leave my friends behind
27-04-2018T04:30:11,unsteddyphoenix,Could you fly???
27-04-2018T04:30:22,Bgrmystr2,"not my cup of tea, xex."
27-04-2018T04:30:23,ZRO4825,"I admittedly got completely distracted till now, surprised you're still going, Sage D:"
27-04-2018T04:30:46,SageSaga,"figured ""These must be an illusion- theres no way hes having us fight dire-"" ""And he grapples you with a 32"" ""Wat"""
27-04-2018T04:30:48,unsteddyphoenix,"Dear god, I would never let that character through lmao"
27-04-2018T04:30:54,Xexanoth,have you tried it? :P
27-04-2018T04:31:17,Xexanoth,if the other characters are equally strong it's fine
27-04-2018T04:31:18,SageSaga,everyone had more powerful characters - it was a high power campaign
27-04-2018T04:31:51,unsteddyphoenix,I forgive the DM slightly for his poor balancing
27-04-2018T04:31:53,Bgrmystr2,"I've seen enough to know, xex. Just not really my deal."
27-04-2018T04:32:00,sunblaze,"clearly we need more half-celestials, driders and alu-fiends"
27-04-2018T04:32:04,unsteddyphoenix,only slightly
27-04-2018T04:32:07,sunblaze,go high power campaign go! :D
27-04-2018T04:32:53,unsteddyphoenix,poweeer~
27-04-2018T04:33:03,Xexanoth,*Unlimited power*
27-04-2018T04:33:09,unsteddyphoenix,Terry crews barbarian would fit in there
27-04-2018T04:33:18,Bgrmystr2,"lol, was gonna say.. calm down Terry"
27-04-2018T04:33:19,SageSaga,i ran him through the numbers
27-04-2018T04:34:36,SageSaga,"""there are 5 of us- our average total damage for a round is 20, anything with a +5 or higher is going to hit the majority of us 50% of the time-"""
27-04-2018T04:35:15,Xexanoth,"the problem with dnd is that power, especially health is very much level based, so being high powered at level 1 doesn'T really mean shit"
27-04-2018T04:35:31,unsteddyphoenix,"""Hoy I thought your strong characters could handle it."""
27-04-2018T04:35:32,SageSaga,it would take us 8 rounds of beating up the one bear to drop it
27-04-2018T04:35:43,unsteddyphoenix,assuming every roll was good?
27-04-2018T04:35:59,SageSaga,while it does 70-100% of our health in damage per hit and its gonna hit 80% of the time
27-04-2018T04:36:18,Bgrmystr2,Luck was not on your side lol
27-04-2018T04:36:19,SageSaga,no averages
27-04-2018T04:36:36,Bgrmystr2,"and there were two of them, yes? not just one"
27-04-2018T04:36:40,SageSaga,yep
27-04-2018T04:36:55,SageSaga,no amount of half celestials was going to beat that
27-04-2018T04:37:01,Bgrmystr2,yall were two metric fucktons of fucked.
27-04-2018T04:37:20,unsteddyphoenix,"I bet like, 30 half celestials could beat that"
27-04-2018T04:37:28,SageSaga,literally- Direbears weigh about a ton
27-04-2018T04:37:54,Bgrmystr2,"it's already 5:38am for you, sage D;"
27-04-2018T04:38:31,unsteddyphoenix,Might have to sleep in an hour or so
27-04-2018T04:39:32,SageSaga,last panel
27-04-2018T04:39:42,SageSaga,though i am upset i dont have time to work on Miharis picture
27-04-2018T04:39:49,SageSaga,im looking forward to coloring it
27-04-2018T04:40:17,unsteddyphoenix,Which?
27-04-2018T04:41:34,SageSaga,this one
27-04-2018T04:42:24,SageSaga,the Serena on the right will be made completely of FIRE
27-04-2018T04:42:40,SageSaga,so im excited
27-04-2018T04:43:17,Bgrmystr2,oo I was wondering what that was
27-04-2018T04:43:27,unsteddyphoenix,aaa nicee~
27-04-2018T04:43:31,Xexanoth,"being completely made of fire really helps when exploring caves, no need for torches"
27-04-2018T04:49:14,Bgrmystr2,just don't fall into cave rivers?
27-04-2018T04:50:39,ZRO4825,Indeed.
27-04-2018T04:56:21,SageSaga,DONE
27-04-2018T04:56:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Very Nicley done
27-04-2018T04:56:36,ZRO4825,Huzzah!
27-04-2018T04:56:55,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-excited: Yesss
27-04-2018T04:57:01,unsteddyphoenix,nice work!
27-04-2018T04:57:04,Bgrmystr2,dat butt too :D
27-04-2018T04:57:09,Bgrmystr2,"nicely done, Sage"
27-04-2018T04:57:54,SageSaga,i think the first naughty scene is in chapter 5 or 6
27-04-2018T04:58:12,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-ohmy:
27-04-2018T04:58:16,Bgrmystr2,which one are we in now?
27-04-2018T04:58:21,SageSaga,4
27-04-2018T04:58:29,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-sad: so far away
27-04-2018T04:58:43,ZRO4825,lol
27-04-2018T04:58:45,SageSaga,gotta build up a relationship more :P
27-04-2018T04:58:55,Bgrmystr2,"yeah I was gonna say, gotta build up first"
27-04-2018T04:59:06,Bgrmystr2,typical story writer..
27-04-2018T04:59:25,Bgrmystr2,Making us wait.. and in turn making the wait worth it
27-04-2018T04:59:27,SageSaga,so yall read the story idea i put in Yosh?
27-04-2018T04:59:44,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: I may have missed it
27-04-2018T04:59:58,SageSaga,ive been trying to come up with crazy Light Novel story ideas
27-04-2018T05:00:26,SageSaga,"especially since i hope to help Nero write ""My Little Sister is Literally Satan"""
27-04-2018T05:00:35,ZRO4825,"You mean the one Kate was reading comic before last, lol"
27-04-2018T05:00:40,SageSaga,yes Zro
27-04-2018T05:00:54,Bgrmystr2,oh that
27-04-2018T05:01:00,SageSaga,thats a legit story im thinking about writing and doing some visuals for XD
27-04-2018T05:01:25,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha
27-04-2018T05:01:39,SageSaga,it wouldnt be very long but i think it would be fun and it would be interesting to try and sell it on Digital through Amazon XD
27-04-2018T05:01:53,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, reading the comments on that page.. I sort of WANT to see you do it cheesy with a bunch of anime tropes"
27-04-2018T05:02:00,Bgrmystr2,cuz those are nice every once in a while
27-04-2018T05:02:03,SageSaga,i want to do that
27-04-2018T05:02:36,SageSaga,I also will make it totally obvious that its doing that- i will write it out blatantly in the description
27-04-2018T05:02:44,SageSaga,it would basically be a parody
27-04-2018T05:02:50,Bgrmystr2,Would read.
27-04-2018T05:02:57,Bgrmystr2,sounds amazing
27-04-2018T05:03:05,SageSaga,but at the same time i would try to make it really fun or maybe even try and make it- heart warming
27-04-2018T05:04:14,SageSaga,i also had an idea based on what Tom said earlier tonight
27-04-2018T05:04:39,SageSaga,"""Just because you have a male character and a female character in a scene doesnt mean they are in a relationship!"""
27-04-2018T05:04:54,Bgrmystr2,xD alright let's hear it
27-04-2018T05:05:48,SageSaga,so i thought it would be cool to have a story about a male and female adventurer that are just really good friends but it always seems like they have this romantic interest in each other that everyone notices - but they cant stand thinking of each other
27-04-2018T05:05:53,SageSaga,as anything but best friends
27-04-2018T05:08:06,SageSaga,"and then at some point the both go ""Fine let's just try it!"" and then they are like - ""That was terrible."" ""Yeah, i cringe every time you call me- ""honey"" euhg!"" ""Yeah it hurts just saying it- well we tried buddy."" ""Oh thank god- call me Buddy again!"""
27-04-2018T05:08:49,SageSaga,buddy has to be the least sexy positive title
27-04-2018T05:09:01,Bgrmystr2,xD
27-04-2018T05:09:22,SageSaga,peace folks! hope yall had fun XD
27-04-2018T05:09:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Nighty night Sage, or good morning. thanks for the stream"
27-04-2018T05:09:54,Bgrmystr2,"thanks for streamin sage, and for more D&D stories"
27-04-2018T05:09:56,Bgrmystr2,:D
27-04-2018T05:10:17,SageSaga,i told yall about the Wizard Candy Store right?
27-04-2018T05:11:08,Xexanoth,That sound like something that ends up with sexual assault charges
27-04-2018T05:11:12,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
27-04-2018T05:12:14,unsteddyphoenix,thanks for the stream~
27-04-2018T05:12:31,SageSaga,we used post-erata rules for how the Permanency spell worked
27-04-2018T05:13:58,SageSaga,"it used to be something like ""Multiply the level of the spell times 1000 Gold"" for the components of the spell"
27-04-2018T05:14:09,SageSaga,"it basically let you make any spell last ""forever"""
27-04-2018T05:14:38,SageSaga,so long as it had a duration above instant
27-04-2018T05:15:06,SageSaga,we abused this by using it on Level 0 spells! Because 0 x 1000 Gold is 0 Gold!
27-04-2018T05:15:16,SageSaga,:D Free!
27-04-2018T05:15:37,Bgrmystr2,so.. permanant level 0 spells?
27-04-2018T05:15:40,SageSaga,But level 0 spells arent like super fancy - but there was one that had so many uses-
27-04-2018T05:15:43,Xexanoth,that's when the you get hit with a random piano falling from the heavbens
27-04-2018T05:15:57,SageSaga,Prestidigitation!
27-04-2018T05:16:00,Bgrmystr2,I would presume spells didn't start till level 1.
27-04-2018T05:16:02,Xexanoth,"no one knows where it came from, but now you'Re dead"
27-04-2018T05:16:06,Bgrmystr2,"cuz, you know, level 1."
27-04-2018T05:16:16,unsteddyphoenix,"So like, infinite cantrips?"
27-04-2018T05:16:17,SageSaga,magic was tiered from 0 to 9
27-04-2018T05:16:23,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
27-04-2018T05:16:33,Xexanoth,level 0 spells are weak spells that don't cost a spell slot and thus can be cast infinite time without having to rest
27-04-2018T05:16:36,SageSaga,no not like infinite cantrips
27-04-2018T05:16:50,SageSaga,back then you still had limited 0 level spells
27-04-2018T05:16:55,Xexanoth,ok
27-04-2018T05:17:11,unsteddyphoenix,Oh
27-04-2018T05:17:13,SageSaga,but heres what we did - all 4 of us were wizards!
27-04-2018T05:17:19,unsteddyphoenix,"So you got cantrips, basically"
27-04-2018T05:17:22,unsteddyphoenix,Wait why
27-04-2018T05:17:26,unsteddyphoenix,lol
27-04-2018T05:17:44,SageSaga,and we bought a house to function as our wizard researching lab- but we spent so much time doing non-adventurering stuff-
27-04-2018T05:18:00,SageSaga,we couldnt afford to keep the house-
27-04-2018T05:18:10,SageSaga,so instead of adventuring- we went into business!
27-04-2018T05:18:20,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
27-04-2018T05:18:28,Bgrmystr2,business is it's own adventure~
27-04-2018T05:18:44,SageSaga,prestidigitation could make something taste like anything
27-04-2018T05:19:24,Bgrmystr2,oh shit lol
27-04-2018T05:19:48,SageSaga,so we started by basically making jelly beans out of a tasteless goop that i think was just made out of like corn syrup or some kinda vegetable byproduct-
27-04-2018T05:20:18,SageSaga,we formed em into star shapes and then made them taste like amazing things- and bagged em and sold em
27-04-2018T05:20:28,SageSaga,we made soooo much money
27-04-2018T05:20:52,Bgrmystr2,hahaha wow
27-04-2018T05:21:01,SageSaga,then the town got attacked and we decided to try and protect our investment- while also getting some free advertising-- and fireballed the Ogres into oblivion
27-04-2018T05:21:04,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah we got a ship as a reward for saving a city recently and now like 1/4 of our play time is just trading
27-04-2018T05:21:08,unsteddyphoenix,It's surprisingly fun
27-04-2018T05:22:16,Xexanoth,"traveller was largely trading, and that game is fun, though the SpaceShips help, i guess"
27-04-2018T05:22:19,unsteddyphoenix,four wizard party...
27-04-2018T05:22:38,unsteddyphoenix,"That could be viable now sorta, they made a warcaster class"
27-04-2018T05:24:12,SageSaga,we each had a different school of focus
27-04-2018T05:24:23,SageSaga,but we all took fireball because why wouldnt you?
27-04-2018T05:25:46,unsteddyphoenix,oh ofc
27-04-2018T05:25:53,unsteddyphoenix,I undrstand completely
27-04-2018T05:27:55,Bgrmystr2,guessing the city really liked that you saved it AND sold good candies
27-04-2018T05:28:04,Bgrmystr2,BEST wizards.
27-04-2018T05:28:12,SageSaga,The Wizard Heroes sold many candies
27-04-2018T05:38:01,unsteddyphoenix,was there no wizard/candy based pun?
27-04-2018T11:42:10,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Oof, good morning."
27-04-2018T13:57:46,Vatruvius,Hello everyone! :ptv-greetings:
27-04-2018T13:58:06,Vatruvius,I think I am going to draw today.
27-04-2018T13:58:30,NightMeaty22,Hello
27-04-2018T13:58:38,NightMeaty22,How you doing
27-04-2018T14:00:35,Vatruvius,Just trying to pass time without a computer.
27-04-2018T14:15:10,NightMeaty22,Ah
27-04-2018T14:37:05,Vatruvius,Definitely going to need more practice. If only there was a cheap alternative to drawing on a tablet and not paper. No matter.
27-04-2018T15:35:36,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, I found out that an artist I adopted a character from has some strict restrictions on what you can and cannot do with the adopted character.  Plus her rules apply to custom design characters too.  I can understand her reasoning though."
27-04-2018T15:36:00,PalmettoPathfinder1,It's to prevent people from buying a cheap adopt and then making a bunch of money off the character.
27-04-2018T15:51:13,Twokinds,I've always been a little confused about adoptables.
27-04-2018T15:51:29,Twokinds,I understand the concept of purchasing the usage of a character design.
27-04-2018T15:51:54,Twokinds,"But if I were going to pay money for it, I'd want full rights to it."
27-04-2018T15:53:16,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Yeah I know what you mean, but it's also because she doesn't want people to adopt a character and then kill them off in some sort of gore fetish.  Most artists I adopt characters from do allow me to use the design and character.  She's the first though."
27-04-2018T15:54:15,PalmettoPathfinder1,And the rules are to prevent people from using the character for other fetishes since she's mainly a strict clean artist.  She got into trouble when a potential employer spotted a character she had sold to another person.  That other person had
27-04-2018T15:54:39,PalmettoPathfinder1,sex artwork done of that character which was a bit awkward for her.
27-04-2018T15:54:50,PalmettoPathfinder1,Explaining to her employer about this.
27-04-2018T15:55:35,PalmettoPathfinder1,"So, I can see it both ways.  It's a good compromise but it does limit the buyer's usage of the character.  I mean I have no intention of using it for some gore fetish or anything like that"
27-04-2018T15:56:17,PalmettoPathfinder1,"But I would like to use the character in stories that I plan to write.  The thing is I can't sell or publish the stories.  Well, I can publish the stories just not profit from the stories."
27-04-2018T15:57:24,PalmettoPathfinder1,"So, if a publisher sees the stories and wants to publish the story I can't.  Although the artist I adopted the character from did say she was willing to sell a license to me to allow me to use the design based on how many books I plan on selling."
27-04-2018T15:57:52,PalmettoPathfinder1,And she's flexible to even take a very small cut of the royalties.
27-04-2018T15:58:07,PalmettoPathfinder1,Instead of charging me everytime I use the character.
27-04-2018T15:58:44,PalmettoPathfinder1,"I can have artwork done of the character, give them a backstory, feature them in stories, etc. I just can't make any money off the adopted character."
27-04-2018T15:58:53,PalmettoPathfinder1,"But yeah, Tom you are right it is a bit confusing."
27-04-2018T15:59:48,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Don't get me wrong, she's an awesome and excellent artist."
27-04-2018T16:00:46,PalmettoPathfinder1,"And I'm not belittling her in any way.  It's just a bit surprised as I assumed she was talking about selling pictures of the adopted character, although I should had checked to see if her TOS included stories as well.  But she's very reasonable"
27-04-2018T16:00:57,PalmettoPathfinder1,according to those who have done business with her.
27-04-2018T16:01:45,Twokinds,"Yeah, I understand."
27-04-2018T16:03:21,PalmettoPathfinder1,It is a very lucrative business actually.  I've seen people willing to pay over a $1000 for a single character.
27-04-2018T16:04:06,PalmettoPathfinder1,Although that was only one time since it was an auction and the bidding got way out of hand.
27-04-2018T16:07:42,PalmettoPathfinder1,But you are right though.  I would prefer to purchase the full rights to the character.
27-04-2018T16:07:53,PalmettoPathfinder1,But beggars can't be choosers.
27-04-2018T16:10:07,Vatruvius,Hmm...never even knew tgat was a thing really.
27-04-2018T16:10:09,BluePhantom90,you do get full rights to the character you adpoted
27-04-2018T16:10:17,Vatruvius,that*
27-04-2018T16:10:41,PalmettoPathfinder1,Not always Blue.  It depends on the artist and their terms of service.
27-04-2018T16:11:09,PalmettoPathfinder1,Most artists do though.  But there are a few who still own the design.  You own the character but not the design.
27-04-2018T16:11:31,PalmettoPathfinder1,It is a good idea since it prevents people from taking credit for something you designed for.
27-04-2018T16:11:36,BluePhantom90,Oh well I have adopted a few characters myself.  I bough those that sell the full rights too you
27-04-2018T16:11:45,BluePhantom90,*bought
27-04-2018T16:12:35,PalmettoPathfinder1,The vast majority I bought from do give me the full rights.  It's just one artist I bought from.  But being a business major I have to look at it from both sides of the fence.
27-04-2018T16:13:15,PalmettoPathfinder1,"But yeah Vat, selling adoptable characters is a big thing.  Some people make a living off of it."
27-04-2018T16:13:54,PalmettoPathfinder1,It's the same way that Fluff-Kevlar depends on his Patreon account to pay his bills and buy his groceries.
27-04-2018T16:14:04,BluePhantom90,Oh there was one adoptable that sold for 4k
27-04-2018T16:14:30,PalmettoPathfinder1,Wow!  Yeah like I said selling adoptables is quite lucrative.
27-04-2018T16:15:09,BluePhantom90,that one was a type of Dragon though. Vary nice detail
27-04-2018T16:16:02,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Nods.  Dragons, especially detailed ones, are usually popular as well as anything canine or feline related.  Cheetah adopts usually go quickly.  I blame Mihari for that.  ;P"
27-04-2018T16:17:01,BluePhantom90,I know a person that dose custom Adopts for $15. But I bought 3 cheetahs and well due to the spots cost me about $40
27-04-2018T16:17:22,PalmettoPathfinder1,I see.  Who is that if you don't mind asking?
27-04-2018T16:17:34,BluePhantom90,oh hold on I can send you a linl
27-04-2018T16:17:37,BluePhantom90,*link
27-04-2018T16:17:46,PalmettoPathfinder1,Thank you.
27-04-2018T16:19:16,iliar,Hm... I've seen some artists for money can add OC to their comics. Of course not as main character. I wonder how much it will be cost to add OC in TK. I think it will be a gigantic pile of cash.
27-04-2018T16:19:17,BluePhantom90,Its this guy. http://www.furaffinity.net/user/kynli/
27-04-2018T16:19:35,BluePhantom90,lol yeah
27-04-2018T16:20:01,PalmettoPathfinder1,Indeed it would @iliar.
27-04-2018T16:20:16,BluePhantom90,BTW the $15 custom adoptable isn't like the highest quality but it gets the base down right.
27-04-2018T16:21:33,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Cool.  Do you own the design of the character as well, or does the artist?  Can you do whatever you want with the character afterwards (although I actually would never kill off any adoptable character I get, even the bad guys)."
27-04-2018T16:25:01,BluePhantom90,He uses a base from someone else. BUT its yours and do what ever you want with them. Never saw in his rules he owns a part of it
27-04-2018T16:25:44,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Ah I see.  Well, that's good to hear."
27-04-2018T16:26:03,Dadrobit,"Yup, artist to artist and contract to contract."
27-04-2018T16:26:17,Dadrobit,It's all copyright divisions and agreements.
27-04-2018T16:27:22,PalmettoPathfinder1,I guess you're saying that it varies from artist to artist right @Dadrobit
27-04-2018T16:27:33,Dadrobit,"The original artist holds the rights to Reproduction, Distrobution, and Derivitaves of the original."
27-04-2018T16:27:49,PalmettoPathfinder1,I see.
27-04-2018T16:28:00,BluePhantom90,I mean I don't see my characters I bought for $15 commissions so I take they are fully mine
27-04-2018T16:28:05,Dadrobit,Title 17. Code ¬ß 106.
27-04-2018T16:28:10,PalmettoPathfinder1,Oh.
27-04-2018T16:28:47,PalmettoPathfinder1,Yeah that law gets mentioned lot in cases of copyright infringement involving anime fansubs.
27-04-2018T16:28:53,Dadrobit,"Any of those ""bundle of rights"" that the original copyright holder has can be negotiated for in the ""adoption""."
27-04-2018T16:29:05,PalmettoPathfinder1,I see.
27-04-2018T16:29:17,Dadrobit,It's really just that you're purchasing a liscense to use the character.
27-04-2018T16:30:47,Dadrobit,Fairly well within their rights to deny the usage for explicit stuff if it's discussed prior.
27-04-2018T16:31:50,PalmettoPathfinder1,Indeed.  The big thing is to prevent hoarders from adopting the characters and to keep gore fetishers from adopting the character and killing them off never to be used again.
27-04-2018T16:34:59,PalmettoPathfinder1,And it's a good way to keep clean artists safe as they probably don't want people to associate them with adult art.
27-04-2018T16:35:50,BluePhantom90,yeah Well I have adopted characters for a story I am writing... r-r BUT some may die off. I have a few I will use for other projects
27-04-2018T16:37:12,Dadrobit,"Eh, I mean I get it and I support their decision. But I also don't get why it's such a big deal of ""not being associated with X fetish,"" over ""don't make unauthorized revenue from this."""
27-04-2018T16:37:45,Dadrobit,"The fetish art might use the same character, but it's going to be associated with a completely different artist."
27-04-2018T16:38:38,PalmettoPathfinder1,"I mean they'll probably die off of old age or off screen or something.  Well, Dadrobit I know sometimes people have sold characters that have already been named and sometimes someone might say this fetish artwork uses a character I adopted from so and so"
27-04-2018T16:38:52,Dadrobit,"Going around making $ without paying royalties, that's what would irk me tbh."
27-04-2018T16:39:42,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Yeah, I would make sure to ask about royalties with an artist whose design I use."
27-04-2018T16:41:02,Dadrobit,"I wish there was actual data on cases where a character adoption being used ""distastefully"" triggered backlash against the original artist."
27-04-2018T16:42:22,Dadrobit,"I seriously doubt there's a impactful effect on the original artists revenue form people going ""ew, I saw what happened to one of their other adoptions."""
27-04-2018T16:42:40,Dadrobit,an impactful*
27-04-2018T16:43:18,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Yeah, that's true.  I guess they want to cover their bases prior to something going wrong.  A way to heading off any trouble that might or may happen in the future."
27-04-2018T16:43:24,Dadrobit,"I mean, maybe there is, but I really doubt it."
27-04-2018T16:44:21,PalmettoPathfinder1,I think it's the hoarding and the gore fetish that I've seen are the two big factors in those contracts.
27-04-2018T16:44:53,PalmettoPathfinder1,As well as the not giving credit where's credit is due too
27-04-2018T16:46:16,Dadrobit,"If I were to make an assumption, I'd take a guess that the particular artist you linked me had one or two bad experiences with clients in the style of something like Tom and ""He who shall not be named"" that made her do a double take going forward. But I"
27-04-2018T16:46:26,Dadrobit,doubt it's a widespread issue.
27-04-2018T16:47:18,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Nods.  Yeah that makes sense.  And the particular artist did in fact mention that she did have a few bad experiences with clients like that.  Although, I'm not too familiar with what happened to Tom."
27-04-2018T16:47:33,PalmettoPathfinder1,But I have a pretty good idea on what might have happened though
27-04-2018T16:48:06,PalmettoPathfinder1,So I won't ask what it was about since I don't want to make Tom uncomfortable.
27-04-2018T16:48:24,PalmettoPathfinder1,Or anyone else uncomfortable for that matter.
27-04-2018T16:50:40,Dadrobit,Gonna head out and try my luck at getting an Infinity War ticket tonight.
27-04-2018T16:50:48,Dadrobit,Have a good one y'all.
27-04-2018T16:51:02,PalmettoPathfinder1,You too.  Have a good day Dadrobit.
27-04-2018T16:52:04,DRAGONTANOPUG,Damnit I just watched the stream from last night and I didn't realize I had to refresh the page so that you guys saw what I was saying and I said a few things are funny and got angry..
27-04-2018T16:53:21,PalmettoPathfinder1,It happens.
27-04-2018T16:56:33,PalmettoPathfinder1,Oh my!  It seems that the Zen fell asleep and fell into Kat's bosom.
27-04-2018T17:15:53,DRAGONTANOPUG,Or was just barely conscious before passing out....
27-04-2018T17:16:13,PalmettoPathfinder1,That too.
27-04-2018T17:16:23,DRAGONTANOPUG,Onto her chest.
27-04-2018T17:16:48,DRAGONTANOPUG,Like hes week but like he could have blacked out then passed out.
27-04-2018T17:17:29,PalmettoPathfinder1,True.
27-04-2018T17:50:41,Vatruvius,Read tge new page and now the shirt makes total sense.
27-04-2018T17:50:47,Vatruvius,the*
27-04-2018T17:54:45,Bgrmystr2,not that the shirt didn't make sense before he added the text lol..
27-04-2018T17:55:42,Bgrmystr2,"as soon as tom revealed that panel, a few ppl, including myself concluded it was a flashback, and the shirt was because of it"
27-04-2018T17:56:25,Bgrmystr2,the text simply confirms the theory :thinking:
27-04-2018T17:58:16,Bgrmystr2,"also, jeez palm is she still doin that thing with the characters?"
27-04-2018T17:59:36,PalmettoPathfinder1,Yeah pretty much.  But it's her right to do that.  I mean I'm not the only one who has adopted a character from her. And I can see why she would want to have those rules in place.
27-04-2018T17:59:53,Bgrmystr2,I wouldn't touch that with 10 mile pole. Sketchy as fuck
27-04-2018T18:00:38,Bgrmystr2,"if you adopt a character, you're buying that character, yes? Why should the person selling it have any rights over what you do with it. It's none of their concern, it's a business deal, nothing more."
27-04-2018T18:00:47,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, look on her page:"
27-04-2018T18:01:01,Bgrmystr2,buying the rights to a character is not the same as selling a character straight up
27-04-2018T18:02:44,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Yeah I know, but there are many reasons to have such conditions.  To keep gore fetishers away from you and to prevent people from claiming that they drew the pic and stealing credit for your work."
27-04-2018T18:03:43,Bgrmystr2,it's none of her concern though. Transfer of ownership from her to the person who buys the character means the person who then owns it is the one responsible for dealing with the people who claim they drew it
27-04-2018T18:04:21,Bgrmystr2,"Once she sells the character, she doesn't need to worry about what she does with it, that's how it works. :u"
27-04-2018T18:04:49,Bgrmystr2,"When you buy somethin from a store, the store doesn't get snippy with you when you use it for something stupid"
27-04-2018T18:06:05,PalmettoPathfinder1,Yeah that's true.  But I guess the art community is different
27-04-2018T18:07:41,Bgrmystr2,"I don't see any difference, really. If you're not buying the product, you're not buying the product."
27-04-2018T18:08:43,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, she has listened that you can do whatever you want, just don't use the character for any gore fetish or use the character for profit."
27-04-2018T18:09:08,Bgrmystr2,Then what are you really buying at that point? Is it really your character?
27-04-2018T18:09:11,Bgrmystr2,cuz I'd say no
27-04-2018T18:10:43,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, people still buy her characters and she has several open species that one can make a fan character of (you do have to follow some conditons and restrictions in order to create a character as she doesn't want you to create pink furred characters)"
27-04-2018T18:10:47,DRAGONTANOPUG,See he black out
27-04-2018T18:12:03,Vatruvius,Seems like he more so went in and out of consensness.
27-04-2018T18:12:17,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Nice suggestion, vatru."
27-04-2018T18:12:30,Vatruvius,Thanks.
27-04-2018T18:13:10,Vatruvius,consciousness*
27-04-2018T18:13:11,DRAGONTANOPUG,Natani and keith are my favorite characters qhen it comes to awkwardness
27-04-2018T18:13:17,DRAGONTANOPUG,When*
27-04-2018T18:34:16,Vatruvius,I think they are justva really cute couple. Partially because of the awkwardness but I think mostly to their discovery of tgemselves as the relationship grows.
27-04-2018T18:39:18,BluePhantom90,Yeah I wont deny Keith and Nat are cute. Just wonder when Lynn finds out they slept together in the same bed lol THAT will be funny
27-04-2018T18:40:17,Vatruvius,Flora all ready knows that...
27-04-2018T18:41:18,Vatruvius,But I am pretty sure Natani won't allow Lynn to change anything.
27-04-2018T18:50:17,Bgrmystr2,fairly sure natani couldn't make lynn do or not do anything.
27-04-2018T18:51:05,Bgrmystr2,not sure if she's actually capable. :thinking:
27-04-2018T18:58:22,Bgrmystr2,:racehorse: :v
27-04-2018T18:58:38,PalmettoPathfinder1,Hey y'all they're thinking about putting Deadpool in a Fast and Furious movie.
27-04-2018T18:58:41,Bgrmystr2,Random zombie horse
27-04-2018T18:58:55,Bgrmystr2,"gonna get somethin to eat, brb"
27-04-2018T18:59:01,PalmettoPathfinder1,lol!
27-04-2018T19:17:18,Vatruvius,Not capable? We have seen what Natani is capable of but not much of Lynn. He is not a fighter either so...
27-04-2018T19:22:53,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Still, he's bureaucrat, and they can be menacing."
27-04-2018T19:24:31,Bgrmystr2,Do you recall Lynn's physical abilities in the encounter with Seraphina and company?
27-04-2018T19:25:04,Bgrmystr2,"or even when they arrived on the docks and then disappeared immediately, that's both impressive speed and avoidability"
27-04-2018T19:26:28,Bgrmystr2,Lynn is not just a bureaucrat.. It's highly likely they're trained for combat as well. It's a necessity when going to visit enemy territory.
27-04-2018T19:26:54,Bgrmystr2,encountering a fight while not being able to counter is a problem
27-04-2018T19:29:51,DRAGONTANOPUG,Im playing minecraft for the first time in 2 years.....   and im really crying because of the times my friends and i had.
27-04-2018T19:30:09,Vatruvius,"I do jot not doubt that he his trained and he showed to be able to fight but weather Lynn can best Natani is up for debate. Lynn did not single handily fight tgat battle, he served as a helping hand."
27-04-2018T19:30:40,DRAGONTANOPUG,Does flora know Nats female yet?
27-04-2018T19:31:34,Vatruvius,"I do not think so, but the general consensus is that the main party knows after the whole dhip incident."
27-04-2018T19:31:46,Vatruvius,ship*
27-04-2018T19:31:53,PalmettoPathfinder1,Yes she knows.
27-04-2018T19:32:14,DRAGONTANOPUG,She wasnt there when she kissed keith.
27-04-2018T19:32:27,DRAGONTANOPUG,Keith gave her his cape.
27-04-2018T19:32:31,PalmettoPathfinder1,Hm......Good point.

27-04-2018T19:40:25,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, there's been several times Lynn showing capable of dodging attacks. As much as Natani is strong, Lynn is still a basitin, and they are the strongest race, physically"
27-04-2018T19:40:48,DRAGONTANOPUG,There would have most likley would have been another comic if she figured out.
27-04-2018T19:41:32,Vatruvius,"Physically yes, Basitin are the most strong but that does not mean all Basitin are stronger tgan other individuals of other races."
27-04-2018T19:44:03,Bgrmystr2,"I feel that if Natani and Lynn had a physical bout, Natani may be more than strong enough to go toe-to-toe with Lynn in strength, but I don't think Natani has the maneuverability and training Lynn has, so it'd be like punching a target you can't seem to h"

27-04-2018T20:13:11,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, signing off.  Wifi is acting up again."
27-04-2018T20:14:28,Vatruvius,Bye!
27-04-2018T21:49:09,DRAGONTANOPUG,Im thinking of reading the comic out loud ina video. Instead of acters for the voices. Yes or no
27-04-2018T21:49:36,Vatruvius,I like it as is to be honest.
27-04-2018T21:49:40,Bgrmystr2,not sure why that's any different.
27-04-2018T21:49:49,DRAGONTANOPUG,There on chapter 5
27-04-2018T21:49:52,Bgrmystr2,ppl can read it themselves though

27-04-2018T21:51:08,Bgrmystr2,people who aren't going to read it aren't going to listen to it either.
