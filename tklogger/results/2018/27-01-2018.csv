27-01-2018T14:30:29,Terryschannel,Ill probably miss today's stream for some reason
27-01-2018T14:30:41,TheFDdriver,why?
27-01-2018T14:30:43,Dadrobit,"I can still play offline, but it's not nearly as fun."
27-01-2018T14:31:34,TheFDdriver,"well, atleast is something"
27-01-2018T14:32:31,Terryschannel,Why does each user name have another languages letter in front of it? I don't mind. Im just curious
27-01-2018T14:32:50,Terryschannel,Check chats user list
27-01-2018T14:33:13,NeonMitsumi,wat
27-01-2018T14:33:19,Dadrobit,"Looking up the error codes, one is ""connection has failed"" and the other is just listed as ""an error has occurred"""
27-01-2018T14:34:01,Terryschannel,You have one mr neo
27-01-2018T14:34:34,Dadrobit,"And the second one that's just listed as an error, I'm seeing reports of people claiming it's an IP blocker from their anti-DDOS system."
27-01-2018T14:34:46,Dadrobit,Not exactly pleased.

27-01-2018T14:38:19,TheFDdriver,ok?
27-01-2018T14:38:55,Bgrmystr2,"Terry, it's probably a bug on your end"
27-01-2018T14:39:09,Bgrmystr2,that sounds too strange to be anything else
27-01-2018T14:39:30,TheFDdriver,try refreshing the tab
27-01-2018T14:43:08,Terryschannel,Video is uploading

27-01-2018T14:54:54,Terryschannel,pokes tom hoping he starts the stream
27-01-2018T14:55:16,qwe304,"its probably somthing wrong with the apps code, probably messing up ascii codes"
27-01-2018T14:56:50,TheFDdriver,"relax Terry, only one more hour"
27-01-2018T14:57:23,Terryschannel,Id rather have an extra hour of streaming
27-01-2018T14:58:24,Terryschannel,I shouldn't push my luck. I don't want to be banned
27-01-2018T14:58:36,Terryschannel,Sorry tom
27-01-2018T14:59:36,qwe304,you wont be banned for being anxious/impatient

27-01-2018T15:00:39,TheFDdriver,is better wait than been anxious
27-01-2018T15:00:59,TheFDdriver,just my opinion
27-01-2018T15:01:47,PalmettoPathfinder1,Hi y'all.  Bad news: My dog Deedee has nose cancer.
27-01-2018T15:01:55,Dadrobit,You will however be called out if you get too annoying.
27-01-2018T15:02:14,Terryschannel,That's good to know
27-01-2018T15:02:20,Terryschannel,Dad!
27-01-2018T15:02:31,Terryschannel,I was replying to dad
27-01-2018T15:02:54,PalmettoPathfinder1,I know.  But thank you for making sure.  I appreciate it.
27-01-2018T15:03:14,Terryschannel,Sorry about deedee
27-01-2018T15:03:38,qwe304,"one of my dogs died last week, he was 16"
27-01-2018T15:03:45,Twokinds,:(
27-01-2018T15:03:55,qwe304,let him out to pee and he didnt come back
27-01-2018T15:03:58,Twokinds,16 is a long life for a dog.
27-01-2018T15:04:09,Twokinds,But I'm sorry for your loss.
27-01-2018T15:04:34,qwe304,"he was a good dog,"
27-01-2018T15:04:45,Terryschannel,Isn't zen close to 16? Spoilers!?
27-01-2018T15:04:48,PalmettoPathfinder1,Yeah.  She's old.  Has some back problems along with other health problems.  But she's lived a good long life.  I think she's 17.  And thank you Tom for the kind words.  I appreciate it.
27-01-2018T15:04:50,qwe304,but he'd been scraping by for a shile
27-01-2018T15:04:58,qwe304,*while
27-01-2018T15:05:31,qwe304,my other dog seems to be taking it harder than i have
27-01-2018T15:06:23,TheFDdriver,someone poisoned my dog when I wasnt around
27-01-2018T15:06:37,TheFDdriver,☹
27-01-2018T15:06:57,Theshadowfox,That’s just messed up
27-01-2018T15:07:36,TheFDdriver,considering he was a good dog
27-01-2018T15:08:16,Terryschannel,:ptv-sad: everything is being murdered or dieting all of a sudden
27-01-2018T15:08:18,TheFDdriver,prob the person was jealous

27-01-2018T15:08:34,qwe304,"if someone did that to one of my dogs, they wouldnt be around very long themselves"
27-01-2018T15:09:06,TheFDdriver,It wasn't right off the bat
27-01-2018T15:09:31,TheFDdriver,i realized about a week later
27-01-2018T15:10:09,PalmettoPathfinder1,Well Deedee lived a good life and we'll cherish her memory.  She'll be with Jesus when she leaves this world.  My parents and I plan to cremate her after she's put to sleep.
27-01-2018T15:12:00,RedDeath2018,I’m so sorry
27-01-2018T15:12:34,RedDeath2018,But at least She will be with Jesus waiting for you
27-01-2018T15:13:03,PalmettoPathfinder1,It's okay.  We knew it was only a matter of time before her time came.  And thank you.  Appreciate it.
27-01-2018T15:13:18,RedDeath2018,No problem
27-01-2018T15:15:00,RedDeath2018,I had a guinea pig a couple years ago temhen one day she stoped moving
27-01-2018T15:15:12,RedDeath2018,Then*
27-01-2018T15:15:17,PalmettoPathfinder1,She's at my parents' house right now with my sister keeping an eye on her.  My parents had to get out of the house (especially my mom since she took care of Deedee the most.  I had to work so much we decided to keep Deedee at my parents'.).
27-01-2018T15:15:35,PalmettoPathfinder1,I'm sorry about your pet hamster.  It's always hard to lose a pet.
27-01-2018T15:15:52,RedDeath2018,Yeah
27-01-2018T15:16:13,RedDeath2018,Great now I’m really sad
27-01-2018T15:16:37,RedDeath2018,Anyone watching the pro bowl
27-01-2018T15:16:47,Terryschannel,Help cheer is up Tom?
27-01-2018T15:16:51,Dadrobit,"D: Sorry to hear about the pooch... Dogs are the best peple, very sad when their time comes..."

27-01-2018T15:19:20,RedDeath2018,Sorry we made your chat depressing
27-01-2018T15:19:21,PalmettoPathfinder1,Thank you Tom!   That'll help cheer everyone up.
27-01-2018T15:19:24,Terryschannel,I knew it. Flora had triplets

27-01-2018T15:21:45,PalmettoPathfinder1,Lol!  Sythe just got spit on!  Oh my.  I guess Reni has some explaining to do.  Also I think I have an idea for a new request: Reni meets the man of her dreams!
27-01-2018T15:22:05,RedDeath2018,She already has
27-01-2018T15:22:06,PalmettoPathfinder1,Oh this new page really brightens things up a bit.
27-01-2018T15:22:10,RedDeath2018,Kei
27-01-2018T15:22:26,RedDeath2018,Yeah it’s pretty funny
27-01-2018T15:22:37,RedDeath2018,Now I’m un the mood to draw
27-01-2018T15:22:44,RedDeath2018,In*
27-01-2018T15:22:47,PalmettoPathfinder1,Well maybe in this request she meets someone different
27-01-2018T15:22:57,RedDeath2018,Like who
27-01-2018T15:23:00,PalmettoPathfinder1,Another dragon perhaps?
27-01-2018T15:23:05,Dadrobit,"I can't tell, is Sythe smiling, or grimacing in the second panel."
27-01-2018T15:23:08,Dadrobit,?
27-01-2018T15:23:37,NeonMitsumi,That definitely isn't a smile.
27-01-2018T15:23:40,qwe304,"is that a ""absoloutely"" what or a ""of course not"" what"
27-01-2018T15:24:07,PalmettoPathfinder1,But who could it be?  Maybe Kei got changed into a dragon or it could be dragon Trace?  Or Dragon Keith?  It could be anyone!  Or it could be human Kei!  Who knows!  I'm not telling. ;)
27-01-2018T15:24:17,Dadrobit,"Dunno, looks kinda like a goofy grin?"
27-01-2018T15:24:49,PalmettoPathfinder1,Looks like if you weren't a dragon I would hit you right now look
27-01-2018T15:25:16,RedDeath2018,Do I really have to go get my tablet again
27-01-2018T15:25:29,Dadrobit,"wut, palm?"
27-01-2018T15:27:16,PalmettoPathfinder1,I was talking about the last panel.  Or are y'all talking about the first panel?
27-01-2018T15:27:27,RedDeath2018,Hey Tom I finish the drawing from Thursday
27-01-2018T15:27:36,PalmettoPathfinder1,Second panel excuse me.
27-01-2018T15:27:46,Bgrmystr2,"Palm, second panel"
27-01-2018T15:28:44,PalmettoPathfinder1,Corrected myself.  Ninjaed you!
27-01-2018T15:28:51,Combak,"Ooh, dragon discussion on the next page! YAY!!"
27-01-2018T15:29:22,BadFoMo,Yay! (Maybe) Lore!
27-01-2018T15:29:42,Dadrobit,2nd yo.
27-01-2018T15:29:45,PalmettoPathfinder1,I wonder if we'll eventually see sea dragons.
27-01-2018T15:30:02,RedDeath2018,maybe
27-01-2018T15:30:03,PalmettoPathfinder1,Or ice dragons even.
27-01-2018T15:30:50,PalmettoPathfinder1,Probably won't see any gem dragons since Wizards of the Coast owns them (unless Tom does a roleplaying setting with them in it)
27-01-2018T15:31:09,PalmettoPathfinder1,OGL is quite useful.
27-01-2018T15:31:54,Bgrmystr2,"You didn't ninja me really, I was answering your question."
27-01-2018T15:32:25,Bgrmystr2,but considered that was the panel that was specified at the beginning of the conversation..
27-01-2018T15:32:56,PalmettoPathfinder1,Ah okay.  I missed tje beginning conservation.  Phone had to reconnect.
27-01-2018T15:33:34,RedDeath2018,At the beginning of the conversation I was playing Madden with my brothers
27-01-2018T15:35:06,RedDeath2018,So basically I missed it all

27-01-2018T15:40:35,PalmettoPathfinder1,Going okay somewhat Marv.  Except my dog has nose cancer but my family and I are handling okay.  Pretty much knew her time was coming.   Still hurts though.
27-01-2018T15:40:47,Dadrobit,And next week we learn that the hierarchy is completely inverted. Indeed the only classes lower than a princess are those titled King and Queen.

27-01-2018T15:41:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,sorry to hear Palm
27-01-2018T15:41:26,RedDeath2018,Hi beckoner
27-01-2018T15:41:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Beck
27-01-2018T15:41:41,TheBeckoner,Sorry to hear that Palm.
27-01-2018T15:41:52,TheBeckoner,Hey Marv. How goes it?
27-01-2018T15:41:55,TheBeckoner,hello Red.
27-01-2018T15:41:59,PalmettoPathfinder1,It's okay Marv.  But thank you and thank you too Beck
27-01-2018T15:43:46,BadFoMo,@Dadrobit Or Nora and Reni are from 'rivel' groups.
27-01-2018T15:44:22,TheBeckoner,"Lol poor Sythe, always getting the short end.."
27-01-2018T15:45:03,PalmettoPathfinder1,You've know I think Reni would be considered a Skywing/Nightwing hybrid in the Wings of Fire universe.
27-01-2018T15:45:14,TheBeckoner,The panel where Reni is lapping the water is very nice Tom. :ok_hand:
27-01-2018T15:45:50,RedDeath2018,I hate the wings of fire books
27-01-2018T15:45:57,PalmettoPathfinder1,Since Skywings are excellent fliers and breath fire.  Nightwings have mind reading and telepathy (if they're born under a full moon).
27-01-2018T15:46:07,PalmettoPathfinder1,Wait what!?  Why do you hate them?
27-01-2018T15:46:22,Dadrobit,"Doubt it, FoMo. Considering she wen't off of Nora's influence to conclude that Trace is the real deal."
27-01-2018T15:46:27,Dadrobit,went*
27-01-2018T15:46:27,RedDeath2018,They were boring and uninteresting to me
27-01-2018T15:46:39,PalmettoPathfinder1,I see.
27-01-2018T15:46:40,RedDeath2018,I have friends who like the series though
27-01-2018T15:46:57,RedDeath2018,Me and my older brother read them
27-01-2018T15:47:26,PalmettoPathfinder1,So why you did you think they were uninteresting and
27-01-2018T15:47:29,PalmettoPathfinder1,And boring
27-01-2018T15:47:55,RedDeath2018,I haven’t read them in years so I kinda forgot
27-01-2018T15:48:25,TheBeckoner,They probably have a friendly/neutral relationship If I had a guess.

27-01-2018T15:49:33,Dadrobit,More master/apprentice than friends or neutral I think.

27-01-2018T16:16:13,PalmettoPathfinder1,Well a lot of people are going to be using Nora Cards to get a lot of Keith and Natani pics drawn.
27-01-2018T16:16:20,Dimensional,At least it's not Kat curled in a tiny box with big pupils.
27-01-2018T16:16:24,PalmettoPathfinder1,Colored I mean.
27-01-2018T16:16:36,Dimensional,I thought the Nora cards were only used to color a sketch.

27-01-2018T16:16:41,Dimensional,Ah.

27-01-2018T16:17:16,Bgrmystr2,usually
27-01-2018T16:17:30,Bgrmystr2,sometimes the sketch is so old that it needs to be re-drawn
27-01-2018T16:17:37,Bgrmystr2,rather than just colored
27-01-2018T16:17:38,Dimensional,If only I had a job right now.
27-01-2018T16:17:41,NeonMitsumi,Blame Azuma for that.

27-01-2018T16:19:03,Dimensional,So she'd have beer goggles?
27-01-2018T16:19:04,ThingsAreMoving,She'd drink the beer I'm sure.

27-01-2018T16:28:40,CrimsonHelsing,basitin ale
27-01-2018T16:28:41,ThingsAreMoving,bad joke

27-01-2018T16:29:11,TheBeckoner,Oooh sounds fun Bgr...
27-01-2018T16:29:13,NeonMitsumi,Isn't around 1100dB enough to create a black hole?
27-01-2018T16:29:19,TheBeckoner,I would like to test that on something...
27-01-2018T16:29:22,NeonMitsumi,Which is around Fus Ro Dah level
27-01-2018T16:29:40,unsteddyphoenix,A sound-black hole?
27-01-2018T16:29:40,DJSylveon,I know that a rocket launch can kill you just from the sound of it
27-01-2018T16:29:43,CrimsonHelsing,"'bout impact shockwave level, yea"
27-01-2018T16:29:43,ThingsAreMoving,MusTardJar creates black holes?
27-01-2018T16:29:46,unsteddyphoenix,Thats a new one
27-01-2018T16:29:46,Dinoman515,"Just fold a piece of paper in half 1,000,000 times."
27-01-2018T16:29:50,DJSylveon,It can also hurt the rocket
27-01-2018T16:29:57,FieryPenguin,I don't think sound can create black holes
27-01-2018T16:30:08,ThingsAreMoving,sound is pressure
27-01-2018T16:30:12,DontuDare,You Could Always trt
27-01-2018T16:30:14,ImagineWagons,Magic is a magical thing
27-01-2018T16:30:23,Bgrmystr2,yeah sound is pressure
27-01-2018T16:30:32,Bgrmystr2,"so technically it can, fiery"
27-01-2018T16:30:37,FieryPenguin,huh.
27-01-2018T16:30:39,Bgrmystr2,you just need some ridiculous amount
27-01-2018T16:30:41,FieryPenguin,well be damned
27-01-2018T16:30:53,TheFDdriver,pressure can create energy
27-01-2018T16:31:02,MadMaxton,"yes sound could compress matter enough to create a black hole, you should also consider how the dB scale works"
27-01-2018T16:31:07,DJSylveon,Pressure is a force :3
27-01-2018T16:31:08,NeonMitsumi,Plugging my boi Jake: https://youtu.be/8VGDhGsYoSA

27-01-2018T16:45:01,ThingsAreMoving,\ [T] /
27-01-2018T16:45:02,DJSylveon,Also not gonna lie this sounds like a song they would play on Space Mountain
27-01-2018T16:45:50,ThingsAreMoving,It reminds me of this Desert city in Ragnarok:Online
27-01-2018T16:45:56,ThingsAreMoving,Modoc?
27-01-2018T16:46:16,ThingsAreMoving,Morroc*
27-01-2018T16:46:36,TemporaryAlien,Whats up
27-01-2018T16:47:03,KiTA,"Now I'm picturing the same exact picture, the same exact pose, but with Flora wearing a Neckless of Humanification... and the slit on the back of the dress causing the exact same look on Trace's face XD"
27-01-2018T16:47:03,ThingsAreMoving,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
27-01-2018T16:47:13,TheFDdriver,"WAIT, did flora cut her hair?"
27-01-2018T16:47:26,unsteddyphoenix,its all done up
27-01-2018T16:47:26,KiTA,"It's pinned up in a bun, I think?"
27-01-2018T16:47:42,Bgrmystr2,probably in a bun
27-01-2018T16:47:53,Bgrmystr2,or in a ponytail
27-01-2018T16:48:01,TheFDdriver,ok but it just looks short
27-01-2018T16:48:18,Bgrmystr2,the part of hair behind her head at the top
27-01-2018T16:48:28,Dimensional,"Trace looks like he's just going casual, while Flora's trying to go out all fancy"
27-01-2018T16:48:33,Dimensional,No earring? XP
27-01-2018T16:48:34,ThingsAreMoving,I'm wondering how hard it was to zip this dress without ripping out her fur in the process.
27-01-2018T16:49:00,DJSylveon,hmmm
27-01-2018T16:49:00,Bgrmystr2,"not difficult, things"
27-01-2018T16:49:03,TheFDdriver,i think is not that hard
27-01-2018T16:49:11,Bgrmystr2,cuz usually there will be flaps
27-01-2018T16:49:18,Bgrmystr2,that cover the area that the zipper would cut into
27-01-2018T16:49:23,Twokinds,Flora doesn't have pierced ears
27-01-2018T16:49:31,unsteddyphoenix,What a nerd
27-01-2018T16:49:36,ThingsAreMoving,"I usually rip some of my beard when I zip my coat, that's why I'm wodering."
27-01-2018T16:49:43,DJSylveon,Isnt there like clip on earings though
27-01-2018T16:49:48,Dimensional,heh
27-01-2018T16:49:51,Dimensional,I was going to ask that
27-01-2018T16:49:53,KiTA,Clothing in General would feel like crap on fur
27-01-2018T16:49:57,Bgrmystr2,"yeah it's not like that for fancy dresses and stuff, things"
27-01-2018T16:49:58,unsteddyphoenix,REEL tigers have pierced ears
27-01-2018T16:50:06,KiTA,It's why all sane anthros go furclad
27-01-2018T16:50:13,TheFDdriver,i think is better without pierced earings
27-01-2018T16:50:21,Aleris,"maybe tight clothing would, but loose clothes would be alright"
27-01-2018T16:50:21,KiTA,Because any cloth rubbing against fur would hurt like hell
27-01-2018T16:50:24,Twokinds,"Well, they'd probably have some sort of fabric solution for that"
27-01-2018T16:50:34,Twokinds,"Like, a strip of cloth that goes over the zipper."
27-01-2018T16:50:42,Twokinds,So it's between the body and the zipper itself.
27-01-2018T16:50:50,Aleris,probably
27-01-2018T16:50:50,DJSylveon,yeah
27-01-2018T16:50:51,unsteddyphoenix,They should have that now! :O
27-01-2018T16:50:52,Terramaster20209,lol i just realized what flora is asking trace XD
27-01-2018T16:50:56,KiTA,"well, even the loose stuff would rub on like the shoulders and the like"
27-01-2018T16:50:57,Bgrmystr2,"yeah see, hat tom said"
27-01-2018T16:50:59,Bgrmystr2,what*
27-01-2018T16:51:01,SpotTheLeopard,"Clip-on earrings are a thing. I don't have pierced ears, so it's my only option"
27-01-2018T16:51:04,ThingsAreMoving,yup

27-01-2018T16:52:22,Bgrmystr2,"lol, not really the same FD :P"

27-01-2018T16:52:53,avaragejo,"pounce trace, POUNCE!"
27-01-2018T16:52:54,Bgrmystr2,you can fix a zipper in a few minutes if it breaks. You can't fix a popped off button without a sewing kit or somesuch
27-01-2018T16:52:57,DJSylveon,Oh there is also velcro
27-01-2018T16:53:07,unsteddyphoenix,Velcro isnt classy

27-01-2018T16:53:36,Aleris,i'd prefer a zipper to velcro
27-01-2018T16:53:38,DJSylveon,"Ok if anyone here makes clothes for a living, find a way to make velcro classy"
27-01-2018T16:53:44,Aleris,"if I had fur, that is"
27-01-2018T16:54:03,ThingsAreMoving,Velcro is already classy. We can explore space thanks to it

27-01-2018T17:16:24,Whitestripes,"Okay, I'm already getting car sick. Just wanted to stop by"
27-01-2018T17:16:46,TheFDdriver,you are in a car?
27-01-2018T17:17:09,Whitestripes,Yes
27-01-2018T17:17:11,Ordithus,No idea.  I though maybe you meant Fundamentals of Engineering (civil)
27-01-2018T17:17:26,qwe304,TTHE PATTERN LOOKS KINDA LIKE KEITHS ROBE
27-01-2018T17:17:31,qwe304,sry caps
27-01-2018T17:18:12,avaragejo,anybody else starting to be reminded of cinders dress from rwby?
27-01-2018T17:18:16,MuonNeutrino,oh wow. flora looks amazing in that dress
27-01-2018T17:18:17,InTheLionsDen,Kat might have cut up Keith's robe to make the dress.
27-01-2018T17:18:17,MintGreen,to late again! picarto´s notification systhem does not seem to work with me
27-01-2018T17:18:17,unsteddyphoenix,Floras Cute Exterior
27-01-2018T17:18:26,MefjuTK,that looks kinda Japanese
27-01-2018T17:18:35,unsteddyphoenix,Chinese
27-01-2018T17:18:39,TheFDdriver,it does
27-01-2018T17:18:42,MefjuTK,MintGreen mine too :/
27-01-2018T17:18:47,NeonMitsumi,China numba wan
27-01-2018T17:18:50,Bgrmystr2,You should probably get the browser notifier for picarto then.
27-01-2018T17:18:56,KiTA,"... It should be translucent, like the stockings. XD"
27-01-2018T17:18:59,MefjuTK,asian lol
27-01-2018T17:19:00,Bgrmystr2,and yeah this is more a chinese style dress.
27-01-2018T17:19:08,CrimsonHelsing,Oriental I think is the word you're searching for
27-01-2018T17:19:09,Combak,"Kita, no."
27-01-2018T17:19:09,MuonNeutrino,And you know trace is going to have fun taking it off of her later ^_^
27-01-2018T17:19:10,Bgrmystr2,super stereotypical
27-01-2018T17:19:17,Bgrmystr2,they always looked nice though
27-01-2018T17:19:38,TheFDdriver,wery classy
27-01-2018T17:19:39,Combak,"Anyways, looking great so far!"
27-01-2018T17:19:41,Ordithus,It works really well with her.
27-01-2018T17:19:48,avaragejo,@kita i can see through your idea. ;)
27-01-2018T17:20:06,MuonNeutrino,i wonder if there are fancy strappy keidran sandals or something that go with the stockings
27-01-2018T17:20:10,MefjuTK,just adorable
27-01-2018T17:20:14,FieryPenguin,"WOW, that's a fancy dress"
27-01-2018T17:20:22,MuonNeutrino,"i mean they can't exactly wear high heels, but that'd probably be the equivalent"
27-01-2018T17:20:26,ZephyrTWolffox,It certainly is nice and classy
27-01-2018T17:20:28,RedDeath2018,Trace is wondering how the question will end if he said somthing
27-01-2018T17:20:28,Bgrmystr2,"of course it is, Fiery"
27-01-2018T17:20:31,FieryPenguin,must have been expensive
27-01-2018T17:20:33,Bgrmystr2,why would it not be?
27-01-2018T17:20:39,FaalKruziikWunduniik,Her name and dress design go well together
27-01-2018T17:20:43,MefjuTK,Trace is rich :D
27-01-2018T17:20:48,Terramaster20209,af
27-01-2018T17:20:55,FieryPenguin,"Oh yeah, flora... heh"
27-01-2018T17:21:00,TheFDdriver,he is
27-01-2018T17:21:01,FieryPenguin,didn't think of that
27-01-2018T17:21:11,Ordithus,"This chat normally isn't quite this fixated on something.  Fora is having an effect on us, Tom!"
27-01-2018T17:21:17,BluePhantom90,I don't remember wedding dresses being something like a Kimono
27-01-2018T17:21:23,Bgrmystr2,"you new here, Ord? :P"
27-01-2018T17:21:24,MuonNeutrino,"that means he's doing soemthing right then, @Ordithus ^^"
27-01-2018T17:21:37,Zakuru,dat pattern mm
27-01-2018T17:21:39,Bgrmystr2,cuz chat fixates on stuff all the timme
27-01-2018T17:21:42,Ordithus,"Well, usually we aren't so fixated on something relevant."
27-01-2018T17:21:44,unsteddyphoenix,Somehow we're discussing fashion more than anything
27-01-2018T17:21:50,FieryPenguin,I'm more enchanted by the dress tbh
27-01-2018T17:21:57,MuonNeutrino,"yeah,w e're usually fixated on completely random things XD"
27-01-2018T17:22:06,Bgrmystr2,Fixation is fixation
27-01-2018T17:22:09,Terramaster20209,its because of the dress
27-01-2018T17:22:14,Combak,It's the way a conversation goes. XD
27-01-2018T17:22:20,TheFDdriver,"brb, gonna take a bath"
27-01-2018T17:22:20,FieryPenguin,It's gorgeous
27-01-2018T17:22:22,MefjuTK,"enchanted dress, thats must be in comic XD"
27-01-2018T17:22:24,ZephyrTWolffox,I'll get fixated when he pulls those stockings off!
27-01-2018T17:22:27,MuonNeutrino,i like that you can just barely see her stripes through the stockings
27-01-2018T17:22:31,NeonMitsumi,I am off for tonight! Have a nice rest of the stream everyone! Good night! :cneonmitsumi-blastoff::cneonmitsumi-really:

27-01-2018T17:23:26,MuonNeutrino,neat flowers in the pattern there
27-01-2018T17:23:33,ZephyrTWolffox,how'd neo animate the comic he JUST put up?
27-01-2018T17:23:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,magic
27-01-2018T17:23:50,ZephyrTWolffox,ah
27-01-2018T17:23:53,Terramaster20209,is it supposed to be chinese style ?
27-01-2018T17:23:58,MidnightBlue78,those details on the dress are on point!
27-01-2018T17:24:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Neon is the chat wizard
27-01-2018T17:24:08,TheBeckoner,See yah Neon
27-01-2018T17:24:13,MintGreen,the stream times are really suboptimal for somebody who lives in germany
27-01-2018T17:24:13,unsteddyphoenix,He's 30+?
27-01-2018T17:24:16,MidnightBlue78,"it's looking amazing, Tom!!!"
27-01-2018T17:24:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,don't think so unseddy XD
27-01-2018T17:24:43,avaragejo,"i know one guy that would have droped a BAD pickup line by now, since he is in the hospital on his birthday i will on his behalf: "" you know flora, that dress would look even better on my floor."""
27-01-2018T17:24:51,Combak,BBL all!
27-01-2018T17:24:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,He is a lady tho
27-01-2018T17:24:56,ZephyrTWolffox,lol
27-01-2018T17:25:03,EnergisticAnomaly,Lol
27-01-2018T17:25:09,unsteddyphoenix,Ban
27-01-2018T17:25:11,RedDeath2018,Lol
27-01-2018T17:25:20,BluePhantom90,Tom should almost be a engraving artist
27-01-2018T17:25:20,Twokinds,XD
27-01-2018T17:25:33,BluePhantom90,with such good patterns
27-01-2018T17:25:36,MuonNeutrino,flora also looks surprisingly different with her hair up that way
27-01-2018T17:25:53,avaragejo,"i will let him know you guy's got a kick out of it, thanks."
27-01-2018T17:26:05,TorqueEmUp,I actually kinda prefer Flora's hair like this. ^^;
27-01-2018T17:26:23,Terramaster20209,I prefer it like this too
27-01-2018T17:26:23,FieryPenguin,Me too
27-01-2018T17:26:24,MuonNeutrino,"also, man what a fancy dress"
27-01-2018T17:26:30,MefjuTK,thats more adult :D
27-01-2018T17:26:31,RedDeath2018,Eh I kinda like it the way it was originally
27-01-2018T17:26:32,MuonNeutrino,"i know it's been said, but still"
27-01-2018T17:26:43,FieryPenguin,But it can't always be perfect
27-01-2018T17:26:44,unsteddyphoenix,It looks damn good
27-01-2018T17:26:47,TorqueEmUp,Also socks with Digitigrade legs got to be a pain.
27-01-2018T17:26:49,unsteddyphoenix,Love the colours
27-01-2018T17:27:13,thestooge,@unsteddyphoenix you beat me to it!
27-01-2018T17:27:20,MuonNeutrino,"@TorqueEmUp well, for stockings that high it probably isn't much different, the claws would be more of the problem"
27-01-2018T17:27:25,FieryPenguin,I have no idea how you did the dress pattern. But i'm in love with it
27-01-2018T17:27:27,MefjuTK,but where are Floras anthene?
27-01-2018T17:27:27,MuonNeutrino,"for shorter socks, perhaps"
27-01-2018T17:27:55,avaragejo,"i'm a long hair lover myself, but even i think long hair done up correctly can be beautiful/sexy.(kat with long hair is a dream of mine...)"
27-01-2018T17:28:31,Twokinds,Flora's antenna have been tamed
27-01-2018T17:28:31,MuonNeutrino,ok well this one is all done then ^^
27-01-2018T17:28:39,unsteddyphoenix,Her antennae will escape halfway through the evening
27-01-2018T17:28:45,Terramaster20209,It's a pain in the arse to keep long hair in perfect shape
27-01-2018T17:28:46,MintGreen,i find it interesting that tom is depicting flore like young women more often even if the art isnt cannon
27-01-2018T17:28:46,unsteddyphoenix,How EMBARRASSING D:
27-01-2018T17:28:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,can't stop the signal
27-01-2018T17:28:58,ZephyrTWolffox,boing
27-01-2018T17:29:16,avaragejo,"as somebody with long hair, terra is correct."
27-01-2018T17:30:02,avaragejo,"nice, soft song..."
27-01-2018T17:30:09,TorqueEmUp,I'd also figure socks would feel awful with fur.
27-01-2018T17:30:10,Terramaster20209,"i have hair below my shoulders as a guy, they're coloured too"
27-01-2018T17:30:35,Dimensional,What about Ankle Wraps?
27-01-2018T17:30:38,MuonNeutrino,"yeah, even short fur would make tight fitting stuff like socks trickt"
27-01-2018T17:30:40,MuonNeutrino,*tricky
27-01-2018T17:30:51,ZephyrTWolffox,Exactly!  Footwear's for humans anyway
27-01-2018T17:30:55,MefjuTK,whyyyy? i loved them
27-01-2018T17:31:03,MuonNeutrino,"at least, tight fitting stuff that has to slide on like socks, anyway"
27-01-2018T17:31:06,ThingsAreMoving,Unless those socks stay in place thanks to static electricity
27-01-2018T17:31:17,FieryPenguin,I want a wallpaper with the dress pattern only
27-01-2018T17:31:19,MuonNeutrino,stuff like the basitin ankle wraps can be put on without pushing the fur the wrong way
27-01-2018T17:31:20,FieryPenguin,No flora
27-01-2018T17:31:23,FieryPenguin,no dress
27-01-2018T17:31:27,FieryPenguin,just the pattern
27-01-2018T17:31:35,TorqueEmUp,I just noticed the hair at the top. :P
27-01-2018T17:31:41,avaragejo,"i can not stand wearing socks, makes my leg hair feel all itchy and augh!"
27-01-2018T17:31:48,TorqueEmUp,indeed
27-01-2018T17:31:53,FaalKruziikWunduniik,same
27-01-2018T17:31:59,MuonNeutrino,"i never wear socks unless i'm outside the house, bleh socks"
27-01-2018T17:32:08,Whitestripes,I always wear socks
27-01-2018T17:32:13,Terramaster20209,neither do I
27-01-2018T17:32:15,MuonNeutrino,gotta admit flora looks good in em tho
27-01-2018T17:32:30,FaalKruziikWunduniik,jepp
27-01-2018T17:32:36,ZephyrTWolffox,I'm sandals or nuthin
27-01-2018T17:33:05,MuonNeutrino,"i wonder what tom's doing now, he's waving his mouse back and forth and all but i only see flora"
27-01-2018T17:33:06,MuonNeutrino,&gt;.&gt;
27-01-2018T17:33:09,MuonNeutrino,&lt;.&lt;
27-01-2018T17:33:22,avaragejo,i'm at the point where i wear slippers year round in place of shoes.(and i live in MI)
27-01-2018T17:33:25,Ordithus,"It's rude to stare, Muon."
27-01-2018T17:33:58,Terramaster20209,My country is known for sandals and socks
27-01-2018T17:33:58,MuonNeutrino,"@Ordithus hmm? there's nothing else to look at here, how could i be staring? &gt;.&gt;"
27-01-2018T17:34:08,Ordithus,I'm guilty as well :P
27-01-2018T17:34:23,MefjuTK,Terramaster20209 ure from poland? XD
27-01-2018T17:34:30,unsteddyphoenix,"Dont be rude, look away from the art at all times"
27-01-2018T17:34:36,Terramaster20209,yep XD
27-01-2018T17:34:37,ZephyrTWolffox,"Yeah, MU, where are your manners? (can't take eyes off of paw"

27-01-2018T17:44:52,Bgrmystr2,"if the legos are melted into a liquid, and then you step on it, are they still lego? :ptv-wondering:"
27-01-2018T17:44:59,FaalKruziikWunduniik,both hot and cold metal legos
27-01-2018T17:45:00,DJSylveon,yes
27-01-2018T17:45:14,avaragejo,"after having foot burns, the thought of stepping on something sharp or hot is a straight up nope from me."

27-01-2018T17:45:56,ClockworkTDC,lol
27-01-2018T17:45:59,Terramaster20209,and for carefull parents
27-01-2018T17:46:01,Clippy,Odd that the lego company and eggo never teamed up to make Lego Eggos

27-01-2018T17:46:20,DJSylveon,better hope those metal legos arent lead legos
27-01-2018T17:46:21,MuonNeutrino,@MefjuTK i'm pretty sure metal legos would count as caltrops. or maybe landmines &gt;.&gt;
27-01-2018T17:47:03,avaragejo,or scatter gun ammo.
27-01-2018T17:47:15,DJSylveon,or IED
27-01-2018T17:47:31,DJSylveon,dont ask why they explode
27-01-2018T17:47:44,Terramaster20209,you could use those legos against a tank XD
27-01-2018T17:47:54,ClockworkTDC,"We should have used lego in the war, just get a box of em and dump them in the trenches"
27-01-2018T17:48:00,avaragejo,it feels like an explosian when you step on one
27-01-2018T17:48:14,MefjuTK,who wins metal lego or nokia 3310 ? XD
27-01-2018T17:48:31,DJSylveon,Today in the TwoKinds chat we talk about pain and ways to feel it
27-01-2018T17:48:33,Terramaster20209,no one would be able to cross the trenches
27-01-2018T17:48:46,FieryPenguin,"lego will be crushed, but the phone will feel deep pain"
27-01-2018T17:48:48,MefjuTK,pain and legos XD
27-01-2018T17:48:53,ClockworkTDC,Exactly

27-01-2018T17:49:38,avaragejo,looks like to is drawing the shadowing framework
27-01-2018T17:49:52,MefjuTK,"if in 2045 someone finds nokia, the phone has been still 90% battery :D"
27-01-2018T17:50:31,Clippy,There was a short time were people were looking for Nokia bricks to use instead of current phones. Was a weird fad
27-01-2018T17:50:51,Clippy,Still have my original Nokia here :)

27-01-2018T17:52:26,DJSylveon,If you look hard enough you can see the banana in trace's pocket

27-01-2018T17:59:33,MviluUatusun,"Maybe it's just me.  I haven't seen her wearing clothing in so long, I may have forgotten how she looked dressed."
27-01-2018T17:59:40,Clippy,I wonder if she's ok he is seeing her at this moment.

27-01-2018T18:00:46,MefjuTK,what you think? where they going?
27-01-2018T18:01:02,SpotTheLeopard,"Mvilu - could be padded bra too, since she is wearing clothes..."

27-01-2018T18:02:17,MviluUatusun,Not that it's for sale or anything.  LOL.
27-01-2018T18:02:25,Bgrmystr2,it doesn't specify it has to be opaque.
27-01-2018T18:02:36,Bgrmystr2,just covered.
27-01-2018T18:02:44,MviluUatusun,Ooh.  Close up of Flora's butt.  Don't every guy go drooling.

27-01-2018T18:03:54,Terramaster20209,lets ask keith
27-01-2018T18:03:59,MviluUatusun,Could ask Lynn.  He would be the final authority.  Wouldn't he?
27-01-2018T18:04:14,Ordithus,"Keith is the worst Basitin to ask, he's a nudist by their standards."
27-01-2018T18:04:22,Terramaster20209,"oh wait, he would get a nosebleed too, damn it"
27-01-2018T18:04:26,985323,"Holy mother, Flora looks gorgeous in this"
27-01-2018T18:04:27,MviluUatusun,"That be true, yes, Ord."
27-01-2018T18:04:37,unsteddyphoenix,Lynn might accidentally make her a general
27-01-2018T18:04:47,thestooge,Should Flora's butt be more shiny?
27-01-2018T18:04:55,MviluUatusun,All she'd need is to have her hair up in one of those Chinese buns.
27-01-2018T18:04:57,Ordithus,"Lynn would be a good choice, Mvilu.  He's even immune to the effects"
27-01-2018T18:05:01,MefjuTK,I think Lynn is good basitin to ask
27-01-2018T18:05:07,unsteddyphoenix,She does have some good chinese buns atm

27-01-2018T18:08:04,MviluUatusun,"You'd think that Trace wouldn't sweat seeing Flora dressed like this.  After all, he saw her nekkid long before we ever did."
27-01-2018T18:08:23,MidnightBlue78,"Tom, have you thought of being a fashion designer? :ctwokinds-smug:"
27-01-2018T18:08:34,FaalKruziikWunduniik,sometimes clothes can be more enticing than beeing naked
27-01-2018T18:08:41,Bgrmystr2,but he would need to design fashion for HOOMANS
27-01-2018T18:08:51,EnergisticAnomaly,Popple is best character

27-01-2018T18:08:59,PalmettoPathfinder1,We are concerned that she might bleed to death while everyone is asleep.
27-01-2018T18:09:30,MviluUatusun,"That be true, yes, Faal.  I've always said a few clothes in the right place are significantly sexier than complete nakedness."
27-01-2018T18:09:31,PalmettoPathfinder1,If it's nose cancer.  Nose cancer in dogs can't be treated.
27-01-2018T18:09:31,MidnightBlue78,i'd like a dress designed by Tom

27-01-2018T18:13:06,RedDeath2018,Trace is wondering whay he got himself into when he walked into that room\
27-01-2018T18:13:06,MviluUatusun,"As short as that tie is, it must be a bow tie."

27-01-2018T18:53:56,MuonNeutrino,i dont remember the stream where that was done
27-01-2018T18:53:59,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, it was drawn off stream as a bonus"
27-01-2018T18:54:02,MuonNeutrino,ah

27-01-2018T18:54:19,Terramaster20209,a wee k ago if i remember correctly
27-01-2018T18:54:27,Ordithus,It was attached to the color vote post.
27-01-2018T18:54:37,CrRAR,"mmm,  it was debuted the beginning of last stream."
27-01-2018T18:54:38,unsteddyphoenix,"He had started it before the sketch stream started as a warm up, but we didnt vote for it~"
27-01-2018T18:54:38,Twokinds,"Funny thing is, I wasn't even planning on drawing that one."
27-01-2018T18:54:43,CrRAR,haha

27-01-2018T18:55:09,Tekros,For sure
27-01-2018T18:55:10,Twokinds,"Funny enough, what made me decided to do it, is because it'd make the number of skeches for the month an even number."
27-01-2018T18:55:20,Twokinds,So the two rows on the voting form would be equal.
27-01-2018T18:55:22,CrRAR,ahhh

27-01-2018T18:58:05,unsteddyphoenix,Everyone liked it a lot after it was already drawn
27-01-2018T18:58:11,unsteddyphoenix,Funny how often it goes like that

27-01-2018T19:12:30,MefjuTK,this wound they will not heal
27-01-2018T19:12:32,Terramaster20209,I sometimes wonder what kind of fetishes would trace have
27-01-2018T19:12:42,qwe304,"wait, what if nibbly is a previous victim of the mansions floor tiles?"
27-01-2018T19:12:44,unsteddyphoenix,"Which is good, that game was a psychological weapon"
27-01-2018T19:12:48,Tekros,Hahaha I know.
27-01-2018T19:12:57,CrRAR,Oh hey
27-01-2018T19:12:57,Tekros,Indeed.

27-01-2018T19:13:22,MefjuTK,i dont know that this game is so popular
27-01-2018T19:13:25,TheFDdriver,is that for Flora?
27-01-2018T19:13:28,Ordithus,"You're not the first person to think that, qwe"
27-01-2018T19:13:32,CrRAR,I bet it has a really cool exotic sounding magic-plant name.
27-01-2018T19:13:33,unsteddyphoenix,Nah it's Rose
27-01-2018T19:13:36,PalmettoPathfinder1,"You know I found a new tabletop rpg.  Or actually, an old one that I've never heard of before."
27-01-2018T19:13:38,MidnightBlue78,iTom uses a little magic wand :3
27-01-2018T19:13:38,qwe304,is it one of the subtleseed plants?

27-01-2018T19:14:12,Ordithus,"Subletseed, it rents out apartments."

27-01-2018T19:15:25,Bgrmystr2,this is probably one of the most-danced songs though
27-01-2018T19:15:33,InTheLionsDen,:ctwokinds-nibsdance::ctwokinds-nibsdance::ctwokinds-nibsdance:

27-01-2018T19:16:22,BadFoMo,Why does this song make me think on mid to late 90's computer games?

27-01-2018T19:17:24,Bgrmystr2,"hell, a quality bed lets you jump on it"

27-01-2018T19:17:33,MviluUatusun,"Well, the stream is acting up.  I'll BRB."
27-01-2018T19:17:38,Bgrmystr2,:u
27-01-2018T19:18:09,Terramaster20209,"I dont have a quality bed, thats the thing, I can do it with my feet tho"

27-01-2018T19:18:28,TheFDdriver,neither me terra
27-01-2018T19:18:39,TheFDdriver,but i dont mind
27-01-2018T19:18:49,Bgrmystr2,your bed would need to be so terrible
27-01-2018T19:18:56,Bgrmystr2,to actually not allow you to bounce on it
27-01-2018T19:18:58,Bgrmystr2,even a little bit
27-01-2018T19:19:11,Terramaster20209,My family doesnt have a lot of money
27-01-2018T19:19:25,TheFDdriver,my bed is a twin
27-01-2018T19:20:20,CrimsonHelsing,Hard to tell if that's sweat or tears
27-01-2018T19:20:21,MefjuTK,i must change my bed
27-01-2018T19:20:23,Dimensional,My bed has a twin. It's evil
27-01-2018T19:20:41,TheFDdriver,wow
27-01-2018T19:20:48,Terramaster20209,is it trying to kill you ?
27-01-2018T19:20:53,MefjuTK,its so uncomfortable :/
27-01-2018T19:20:58,Dimensional,"No, but the other one is."
27-01-2018T19:21:30,DJSylveon,So cute
27-01-2018T19:21:33,Terramaster20209,"mt bed is killing my back slowly, but I atleast have one"
27-01-2018T19:21:34,MidnightBlue78,my bed has crumbs bc my son is always eating in it:ptv-unimpressed:
27-01-2018T19:21:38,TheFDdriver,ok? i will just talking for now
27-01-2018T19:21:47,CrRAR,damn
27-01-2018T19:22:25,unsteddyphoenix,Wait isnt your son a teen
27-01-2018T19:22:29,unsteddyphoenix,Why is he eating in your bed
27-01-2018T19:22:35,MefjuTK,i hope that flora's and Trace's bed is comfortable :D
27-01-2018T19:22:37,Bgrmystr2,can't he eat in his own bed?
27-01-2018T19:22:38,Tekros,"Hey Tom if you ever get the chance, you should check out Zizibum by The Grayscale Project. They're a small group but their chiptunes are out of this world. Zizibum is easily their best song."
27-01-2018T19:22:50,Terramaster20209,probably is
27-01-2018T19:23:11,TheFDdriver,never heard of it
27-01-2018T19:23:13,Bgrmystr2,"you should probably take your sheets, midnight, and shake them above his bed"
27-01-2018T19:23:18,Bgrmystr2,so all the crumbs go there
27-01-2018T19:23:18,Twokinds,"Okay, sure"
27-01-2018T19:23:21,Twokinds,Email it to me
27-01-2018T19:23:23,Bgrmystr2,and then make him deal with it :D
27-01-2018T19:23:39,MviluUatusun,"Well, I figured out the biggest problem with the stream.  Picarto don't like it when I have two streams open at the same time."
27-01-2018T19:23:52,KawaiiFlora,picarto just doesnt like running smoothly at all for me lol
27-01-2018T19:23:56,TheFDdriver,true
27-01-2018T19:23:56,Tekros,Will do. ^^
27-01-2018T19:24:07,KawaiiFlora,twitch loads fine but a lot of buffering here for me
27-01-2018T19:24:18,Terramaster20209,picarto doesnt like you to have one stream open
27-01-2018T19:24:23,MidnightBlue78,i would have to  do it everyday Beegee
27-01-2018T19:24:24,MviluUatusun,"Sometimes it works fantastically well, Kawaii, other times it say F it."
27-01-2018T19:24:35,Bgrmystr2,"well, do it every day. xD"
27-01-2018T19:24:40,KawaiiFlora,"yeah, yesterday i was watching a stream fine."
27-01-2018T19:24:42,Bgrmystr2,cuz then he'll learn to stop
27-01-2018T19:24:52,MviluUatusun,"One of the artists I follow uses twitch to stream with now, Kawaii."
27-01-2018T19:24:53,MidnightBlue78,:ptv-uneasy:
27-01-2018T19:24:58,Terramaster20209,it says f  you to me every time I watch 2kinds streams
27-01-2018T19:25:07,MefjuTK,gah.. damn lag...
27-01-2018T19:25:08,TheFDdriver,same
27-01-2018T19:25:09,MuonNeutrino,twitch would probably object to the number of nude keidran in tom's streams &gt;.&gt;
27-01-2018T19:25:14,Bgrmystr2,the stream here is pretty demanding on hardware
27-01-2018T19:25:17,KawaiiFlora,harder to gain a followage as an artist on twitch though.
27-01-2018T19:25:17,Terramaster20209,yes it would
27-01-2018T19:25:19,PalmettoPathfinder1,This is a very sweet and heartwarming pic.
27-01-2018T19:25:24,Whitestripes,The stream runs smoothly for me
27-01-2018T19:25:26,KawaiiFlora,Unless your Bob Ross that is xD
27-01-2018T19:25:30,TheFDdriver,i have to do critical procedures
27-01-2018T19:25:37,TheFDdriver,well sometimes
27-01-2018T19:25:45,Terramaster20209,good for you Whitestripes
27-01-2018T19:25:49,Bgrmystr2,"twitch doesn't have built-in support for hardware acceleration, but Picarto does. So it will try to use it. Twitch only uses your CPU"
27-01-2018T19:25:58,Serpentfrog,That would be *you're Bob Ross. Your Bob Ross is quite different.
27-01-2018T19:25:58,Ordithus,I feel weird.  I never have trouble with picarto
27-01-2018T19:26:18,KawaiiFlora,Im not too great with english serpent
27-01-2018T19:26:18,Terramaster20209,maybe its because i use my phone for it
27-01-2018T19:26:18,CrRAR,the picarto god smiles upon you
27-01-2018T19:26:27,Ordithus,"I've had 5 streams going at once, no problem"
27-01-2018T19:26:54,KawaiiFlora,maybe you have really good internet?
27-01-2018T19:27:02,Whitestripes,I'm only watching TK stream. Maybe this why it runs smoothly for me
27-01-2018T19:27:06,Ordithus,Apparently.
27-01-2018T19:27:06,DJSylveon,I have bad internet
27-01-2018T19:27:11,DJSylveon,Its fine here
27-01-2018T19:27:16,TheFDdriver,damm you have a good device

27-01-2018T19:27:50,Ordithus,"Tom is Ohio, Picarto is probably California"

27-01-2018T19:30:15,Bgrmystr2,Pretty sure Picarto is not hosted in California
27-01-2018T19:30:15,unsteddyphoenix,How many giant robots do you own?
27-01-2018T19:30:32,TheFDdriver,i have seen very weird stuff you can find on Japan

27-01-2018T19:32:51,Ordithus,A service like Picarto likely uses datacenters throughout the world

27-01-2018T20:19:51,Katfeathers,*shifts feral and super saiyan catloafs*
27-01-2018T20:19:53,Bgrmystr2,not everyone has time to watch em. Some people watch the recordings and stuff
27-01-2018T20:19:54,Xexanoth,but who wants to eat olives?
27-01-2018T20:20:03,Bgrmystr2,"I would, if it's a black olive."
27-01-2018T20:20:06,Bgrmystr2,those are good
27-01-2018T20:20:10,Bgrmystr2,no pits tho

27-01-2018T20:20:14,Bgrmystr2,kill that with fire
27-01-2018T20:20:17,ZephyrTWolffox,I love olives
27-01-2018T20:20:19,HeresyArtStream,I should see if the place up the street will serve me a giant martini with Kat in it.
27-01-2018T20:20:33,unsteddyphoenix,Surely
27-01-2018T20:20:41,Serpentfrog,Have you guys read Gilgamesh yet? It's still new so no spoilers.
27-01-2018T20:20:46,Xexanoth,if you try that they'll probably only serve a a restraining order
27-01-2018T20:20:59,TheFDdriver,that would be $19990
27-01-2018T20:21:19,Ordithus,Yay chinese food
27-01-2018T20:21:31,TheFDdriver,so expensive
27-01-2018T20:21:39,Twokinds,I like olives too
27-01-2018T20:21:51,DJSylveon,Am I the only one who hates olives?
27-01-2018T20:21:51,TheFDdriver,alone?
27-01-2018T20:22:00,Twokinds,Yeah
27-01-2018T20:22:03,Nekonny,olivs are great
27-01-2018T20:22:10,Katfeathers,Aye
27-01-2018T20:22:21,Nekonny,I like the greens ones more though
27-01-2018T20:22:21,unsteddyphoenix,I dislike...black olives?
27-01-2018T20:22:21,w0lfmare,"Mmm, olives"
27-01-2018T20:22:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,they must never know my olive opinion
27-01-2018T20:22:25,ZephyrTWolffox,"I usually have them in or on something, but I really do enjoy"
27-01-2018T20:22:38,TheFDdriver,never try them alone
27-01-2018T20:22:43,Xexanoth,olives are bad
27-01-2018T20:22:49,CrRAR,mmmmkay?
27-01-2018T20:22:51,Xexanoth,the always ruin otherwise good food
27-01-2018T20:22:55,Nekonny,"I lived in portugal once, so I had no choice, olives were mandatory"
27-01-2018T20:23:45,TheFDdriver,a sandwich w/ stick in a olive
27-01-2018T20:24:21,Twokinds,I just like flavor extremes.
27-01-2018T20:24:22,ZephyrTWolffox,"I can have a few alone, but aftera while the vinnegar can get to me'"
27-01-2018T20:24:29,DJSylveon,awww the sad portal 2 song
27-01-2018T20:24:32,unsteddyphoenix,Weird!
27-01-2018T20:24:34,Twokinds,I eat green olives a lot just because they're sour.
27-01-2018T20:24:45,TheFDdriver,they are?
27-01-2018T20:24:50,PalmettoPathfinder1,So wyvern or dragon?  Which do y'all prefer?
27-01-2018T20:24:54,unsteddyphoenix,Are you tastebuds broken or?
27-01-2018T20:24:58,PalmettoPathfinder1,Tom you have to answer this question too.
27-01-2018T20:25:09,CrRAR,then follow that with a bucket of jalapenos
27-01-2018T20:25:11,Twokinds,No. I just don't like boring stuff. More flavor = more betterer!
27-01-2018T20:25:19,ZephyrTWolffox,Dragon
27-01-2018T20:25:22,Ordithus,This does explain the kimchi
27-01-2018T20:25:27,Xexanoth,wyvern is a type of dragon....
27-01-2018T20:25:31,TheFDdriver,I agree
27-01-2018T20:25:34,BluePhantom90,what about Cheerio's?
27-01-2018T20:25:36,unsteddyphoenix,Thats...I mean...
27-01-2018T20:25:37,Xexanoth,thats like saying cobra or snake

27-01-2018T20:26:10,Serpentfrog,"Serpents are superior to both, Xex."
27-01-2018T20:26:13,Twokinds,Yes!
27-01-2018T20:26:19,Bespin,yes!
27-01-2018T20:26:20,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, if you were to tell a dragon that a wyvern was a type of dragon, you're likely going to get your head bitten off!  Apparently dragons don't consider wyverns to be dragons."
27-01-2018T20:26:29,unsteddyphoenix,"add honey to pasta, stronger flavour"
27-01-2018T20:26:30,Twokinds,"I had some stuffed green olives recently, it was very good."
27-01-2018T20:26:30,Zakuru,cya everyone. love and hugs~ &lt;3

27-01-2018T20:26:53,Xexanoth,that's only in specific universees palmetto bcause the writer of that specific universe decided so
27-01-2018T20:26:53,Serpentfrog,"In what canon, Palm?"
27-01-2018T20:26:59,TheFDdriver,bye zak
27-01-2018T20:27:16,Xexanoth,particular Dungeons and Dragons made it popular after it came out
27-01-2018T20:27:21,PalmettoPathfinder1,"D&D apparently, @Serpentfrog.  I actually read it in some source material."
27-01-2018T20:27:43,Serpentfrog,They were just copying Tolkien. :v
27-01-2018T20:27:44,Xexanoth,but thats ignoring thousand of years of human mythology for a book that came out last century -.-
27-01-2018T20:28:08,PalmettoPathfinder1,True.  That's a good point.
27-01-2018T20:28:13,PalmettoPathfinder1,Both of you.
27-01-2018T20:28:18,BluePhantom90,I only have the 4th edition
27-01-2018T20:28:37,BluePhantom90,not sure if the 5th is worth it.
27-01-2018T20:28:45,Ordithus,5ed is good fun
27-01-2018T20:29:03,unsteddyphoenix,everyone ive ever talked to has said 4th ed is garbage and it skip it
27-01-2018T20:29:06,TheFDdriver,donkey kong music
27-01-2018T20:29:21,PalmettoPathfinder1,Why do you say that?  What's wrong with 5th edition?  It is fun.  I actually helped play test 5e.
27-01-2018T20:30:26,Twokinds,Tail smoooosh
27-01-2018T20:30:29,BluePhantom90,Eh they ruined a lot of stuff with 5e. But threw a lot of new characters into the game which you have to buy all those books
27-01-2018T20:30:35,CrRAR,haha
27-01-2018T20:30:49,CrRAR,squooshed good

27-01-2018T20:32:11,Bespin,SHHHAKe
27-01-2018T20:32:11,DJSylveon,This is a Bond drink now

27-01-2018T20:32:18,Bgrmystr2,"she's fine, look at her face, Palm"
27-01-2018T20:32:20,unsteddyphoenix,To stir just flip the image a bunch of times lol
27-01-2018T20:32:27,ZephyrTWolffox,BZZZZZZZZT
27-01-2018T20:32:29,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Anyhow, what was y'all's opinion on dragonborn having breasts?"
27-01-2018T20:32:33,Ordithus,:ptv-RainbowThrowup:
27-01-2018T20:32:41,Bespin,uh oh
27-01-2018T20:32:42,Bespin,Ok
27-01-2018T20:32:45,Bespin,kek
27-01-2018T20:32:46,Xexanoth,"my stream is lagging behind so badly, it's gonna be fun seeing what you're all talking about in a few minutes -.-"
27-01-2018T20:32:57,TheFDdriver,same
27-01-2018T20:33:06,Bgrmystr2,then stop the stream and refresh the page
27-01-2018T20:33:06,DJSylveon,@xexanoth try switching to flash or mp4
27-01-2018T20:33:08,Terramaster20209,im so luck
27-01-2018T20:33:10,microbuss,meyow!
27-01-2018T20:33:13,Katfeathers,"They are anthropomorphic, why not."
27-01-2018T20:33:15,Xexanoth,already tried that
27-01-2018T20:33:19,DJSylveon,hmmmm
27-01-2018T20:33:23,Bgrmystr2,then clear your cache and do it
27-01-2018T20:33:25,Xexanoth,it's probably something on my end
27-01-2018T20:33:38,Xexanoth,since the i usually never have any problems
27-01-2018T20:33:39,Ordithus,"Argonians have bewbs.  And they're lizard trees, or something"
27-01-2018T20:33:40,Bgrmystr2,fix it :u
27-01-2018T20:33:45,TheFDdriver,takes cover
27-01-2018T20:33:50,Bespin,Argonians are EVIL
27-01-2018T20:34:00,Bespin,also why does the stream keep freezing for like 2 seconds
27-01-2018T20:34:01,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, the thing is: dragonborn are reptiles and dragonborn hatch from eggs.  So people thought, wait why do they have breasts!"
27-01-2018T20:34:02,Ordithus,That's racist
27-01-2018T20:34:03,Bespin,and returning
27-01-2018T20:34:08,Xexanoth,"with my end i mean, probably my provider fucking something up"
27-01-2018T20:34:10,Bgrmystr2,"it's not, Bespin"
27-01-2018T20:34:14,Bespin,for me it is
27-01-2018T20:34:15,Bespin,...
27-01-2018T20:34:17,Bgrmystr2,then it might be you.
27-01-2018T20:34:27,Xexanoth,or maybe picarto is just overloaded today
27-01-2018T20:34:42,Xexanoth,welcome to the lag club bespin
27-01-2018T20:34:42,Bgrmystr2,"Xex, try closing and reopening your browser"
27-01-2018T20:34:44,ZephyrTWolffox,doing that for me too.  I think it has to do with bandwidth
27-01-2018T20:34:46,Bgrmystr2,it could be using a lot of memory
27-01-2018T20:34:49,PalmettoPathfinder1,And here's the reason why they put breasts on female dragonborn: so people could tell what characters were female in the artwork!
27-01-2018T20:34:50,TheFDdriver,is the coast clear
27-01-2018T20:34:51,Xexanoth,i already changed browser twice
27-01-2018T20:35:01,Bespin,oh boy this si annoying
27-01-2018T20:35:10,Bgrmystr2,"I had to recently restart my browser, was using 6gb of ram by itself."
27-01-2018T20:35:14,Terramaster20209,if on a phone just dowloand the app
27-01-2018T20:35:15,ZephyrTWolffox,probably throttling by our ISP
27-01-2018T20:35:17,Ordithus,"Tom, what's your stream's bitrate?"
27-01-2018T20:35:26,Xexanoth,you using firefox bgr?
27-01-2018T20:35:29,pretorian,I only have 6 minutes delay on stream... Not even rebooting my computer fixed that :D
27-01-2018T20:35:32,Combak,"... You know, I was going to say I can't hear this song without thinking of a LP of ""To The Moon"" I watched... And then I looked at the song name. XD"
27-01-2018T20:35:40,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah, but it's irrelevant, cuz it'll happen in any browser. It's picarto"
27-01-2018T20:35:46,Twokinds,I need to play the sequel
27-01-2018T20:35:46,Bgrmystr2,the HTML5 player has memory leak

27-01-2018T20:38:43,Bgrmystr2,flash has memory leaks too though
27-01-2018T20:38:53,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Ah yes, the dreaded spots."
27-01-2018T20:39:00,Xexanoth,pretty sure everything has memory leaks at this point
27-01-2018T20:39:04,Bgrmystr2,"are they dreaded, Palm?"
27-01-2018T20:39:08,Bgrmystr2,"not everything, surprisingly Xex"

27-01-2018T20:39:15,Bgrmystr2,but a lot of scripts yeah
27-01-2018T20:39:17,Xexanoth,programmer sjust don't care enough anymore since everyone has so much ram anyways
27-01-2018T20:39:24,PalmettoPathfinder1,Depends.  I pretty sure Tom's hand dreads them.
27-01-2018T20:39:28,unsteddyphoenix,very nice and very cute spots
27-01-2018T20:39:40,Xexanoth,it's like: well they're not gonna leave it open for 6 hours so it doesn't matter
27-01-2018T20:39:42,unsteddyphoenix,Nice break from striples
27-01-2018T20:39:44,ZephyrTWolffox,At least it's not Abel from DMFA
27-01-2018T20:39:45,DJSylveon,you see there are three parts to a spot and if you get to the right spot with a half a press
27-01-2018T20:39:47,Xexanoth,these guys don't know me XD
27-01-2018T20:39:47,Bgrmystr2,that lil bitty small dot tho

27-01-2018T20:40:07,Combak,They really are big.
27-01-2018T20:40:18,Xexanoth,"not the ""average"" user @Vile"
27-01-2018T20:40:19,TheVileOne,you're not a very smart programmer if you assume people don't leave their stuff open
27-01-2018T20:40:23,PalmettoPathfinder1,"@ZephyrTWolffox you have a point.  Yikes, that was lot of spots!"
27-01-2018T20:40:25,Ordithus,:ptv-laugh:
27-01-2018T20:41:35,TheVileOne,anyways sometimes there is literally nothing you can do about the leak
27-01-2018T20:42:06,TheVileOne,because legacy software is dumb
27-01-2018T20:42:08,TheVileOne,and leaks
27-01-2018T20:42:57,Bgrmystr2,new software is also dumb and leaks
27-01-2018T20:43:01,Bgrmystr2,"there's no difference, vile"
27-01-2018T20:43:03,Katfeathers,*finds a leak and stuffs it with a leek*

27-01-2018T20:43:52,TheFDdriver,i forgot to put % to f#%#
27-01-2018T20:44:04,unsteddyphoenix,"She can hold a glass above her head and not spill anything, shes fine"

27-01-2018T20:47:13,DJSylveon,In all my years on the internet I have learned if you say something it isnt doing it will immediately do it
27-01-2018T20:47:30,Katfeathers,Most likely
27-01-2018T20:47:44,DJSylveon,Unless its to get it to work right
27-01-2018T20:48:39,DJSylveon,Now get off the phone so I can use the internet
27-01-2018T20:48:58,Tekros,Back.

27-01-2018T20:49:39,Tekros,"Tom, I sent you that email with the music I was talking about."
27-01-2018T20:51:20,Ordithus,That's more sword-like than the typical olive spear.
27-01-2018T20:51:38,CrRAR,low-key prepared for anything

27-01-2018T20:52:33,PalmettoPathfinder1,I wonder....if Twokinds was tabletop game would it be considered a part of the BESM system?
27-01-2018T20:52:35,Twokinds,It's in case anyone tries to drink her
27-01-2018T20:52:37,CrRAR,oh yeahh

27-01-2018T20:54:21,Tekros,Beeton*
27-01-2018T20:54:33,PalmettoPathfinder1,I don't think I would drink after she's been in it .
27-01-2018T20:54:38,ZephyrTWolffox,"I'm starting to drop connection, so I gtg."
27-01-2018T20:54:38,CrRAR,ooooOoo

27-01-2018T20:55:25,PalmettoPathfinder1,Still doesn't mean I don't love up against them!
27-01-2018T20:55:45,Katfeathers,So probably hyena hair too
27-01-2018T20:55:56,PalmettoPathfinder1,Just my allergies go haywire afterwards.
27-01-2018T20:56:08,PalmettoPathfinder1,And yeah any sort of animal hair actually.

27-01-2018T21:01:50,unsteddyphoenix,Probably feels decadent
27-01-2018T21:02:04,Terramaster20209,does it have that bubling efect  ? and you would probably stink of alchol
27-01-2018T21:02:29,DJSylveon,I know there is somewhere in japan where you can bath in liqiour
27-01-2018T21:02:43,Ordithus,Sounds expensive
27-01-2018T21:02:44,Terramaster20209,too far away
27-01-2018T21:03:07,DJSylveon,Is it too far away to literally swim in vodka and wine?
27-01-2018T21:03:26,Xexanoth,why would you want to in the first place
27-01-2018T21:03:34,Terramaster20209,just like half the world .
27-01-2018T21:03:40,DJSylveon,Just to say I did
27-01-2018T21:04:38,Xexanoth,pretty sure if you tell theat people they just look at you like you're a crazy person
27-01-2018T21:04:53,Terramaster20209,I would do it tho
27-01-2018T21:05:06,unsteddyphoenix,Absolutely

27-01-2018T21:08:23,PalmettoPathfinder1,Do Keidrans' eyes turn red when they get wasted?
27-01-2018T21:08:29,InTheLionsDen,Fangs.
27-01-2018T21:08:30,Terramaster20209,she would dronk your blood just like that martini
27-01-2018T21:08:37,DJSylveon,how do you know blood wont get lighter after being carbonated/
27-01-2018T21:08:47,unsteddyphoenix,Now turn the bitten olive into a bitten head
27-01-2018T21:08:50,Ordithus,That's more like it &lt;3
27-01-2018T21:09:12,Terramaster20209,i like it better with the red yes
27-01-2018T21:09:26,InTheLionsDen,Gaze into those lovely eyes.
27-01-2018T21:09:44,KiTA,have a tiny natani looking shocked reflected in the eyes :P
27-01-2018T21:09:55,unsteddyphoenix,&lt;33333
27-01-2018T21:09:59,Terramaster20209,you can just feel that shes going to kill you in your sleep
27-01-2018T21:11:29,KawaiiFlora,i find it crazy how anyone can make drawings like these so fast
27-01-2018T21:11:39,DJSylveon,time
27-01-2018T21:11:50,unsteddyphoenix,It's pretty sugoi
27-01-2018T21:11:59,KawaiiFlora,take me 10 hours on the fur xD
27-01-2018T21:12:16,Terramaster20209,"it would take me atleast 6 h to do it, he has more than 14 years of experience"
27-01-2018T21:12:35,HeresyArtStream,oh wow these colors are looking great
27-01-2018T21:12:38,CrRAR,wow
27-01-2018T21:12:44,Katfeathers,And now I see the eyes
27-01-2018T21:12:57,Terramaster20209,its gonna be a pain in the arse to get them
27-01-2018T21:13:02,DJSylveon,the eyes have it
27-01-2018T21:13:07,unsteddyphoenix,Why this olive looking like a strawberry
27-01-2018T21:13:07,KawaiiFlora,i love the color of the drink
27-01-2018T21:13:25,Terramaster20209,i have the promarker for the eyes
27-01-2018T21:13:31,DJSylveon,I had a martini that color and it had a light up ice cube in it
27-01-2018T21:13:41,DJSylveon,It was very sugary
27-01-2018T21:13:45,Ordithus,It's not a standard martini.  A strawberry makes sense for a fruity drink
27-01-2018T21:13:55,unsteddyphoenix,true actually
27-01-2018T21:14:23,Bgrmystr2,that's a bigass strawberry
27-01-2018T21:14:34,KawaiiFlora,well its a giant martini glass too xD
27-01-2018T21:14:42,unsteddyphoenix,"Big olive is one thing, but big STRAWBERRY?"
27-01-2018T21:14:44,unsteddyphoenix,Madness!
27-01-2018T21:14:44,Cowkingjavi,If only strawberries were that big in real life
27-01-2018T21:14:51,unsteddyphoenix,Ikr
27-01-2018T21:14:52,KawaiiFlora,or their normal sizes and kat is just tiny
27-01-2018T21:14:53,Ordithus,That would be amazing
27-01-2018T21:14:56,LeKnightWolf,omg
27-01-2018T21:14:58,Bgrmystr2,reminds me of those little strawberry candies we were talkin about a few streams back
27-01-2018T21:16:06,KiTA,the ones with a liquid like center?
27-01-2018T21:16:21,Bgrmystr2,I think so
27-01-2018T21:16:26,Bgrmystr2,it's been so damn long since I had one
27-01-2018T21:16:41,KawaiiFlora,are these just random drawings or are they going to be used for something?
27-01-2018T21:16:50,Bgrmystr2,they're patreon suggestions
27-01-2018T21:16:56,unsteddyphoenix,Theyre going to be used for looking at
27-01-2018T21:17:08,Bgrmystr2,basically. What phoenix said.
27-01-2018T21:17:24,SpyChar,a noble cause
27-01-2018T21:17:42,DJSylveon,Looking at things is fun
27-01-2018T21:17:43,Neverborn,"lol, wasnt that an olive before?"
27-01-2018T21:17:55,unsteddyphoenix,Stop living in the past
27-01-2018T21:18:01,DJSylveon,it was a normal martini before
27-01-2018T21:18:04,Neverborn,ok.
27-01-2018T21:18:39,KiTA,"followup picture:  Kat dyed pink and looking soggy, going ""ok, whose bright idea was this?!"""
27-01-2018T21:18:51,KiTA,"Eric pointing at himself looking sheepsih.  Kat:  "".... Oh."""
27-01-2018T21:18:54,unsteddyphoenix,*[oops]

27-01-2018T21:53:16,Combak,"Generally speaking, alcohol gets removed from cooked food via degradation or evaporation."
27-01-2018T21:53:17,CrimsonHelsing,You've earned the rest! See you in the next stream!

27-01-2018T21:53:31,SuperLebensmude,Inject the alcohol after ya cook it.
27-01-2018T21:53:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"See ya'll, stay safe out there"
27-01-2018T21:53:36,Dadrobit,Have a good one all y'all that are leaving!
27-01-2018T21:53:45,RandomTKLover,Hi and bye guys
27-01-2018T21:53:45,qwe304,'caps of the sketches
27-01-2018T21:53:49,qwe304,https://imgur.com/a/VESGL
27-01-2018T21:54:03,Combak,Then you're just adding lots of water or possibly poisoning yourself.
27-01-2018T21:54:09,RandomTKLover,Hax
27-01-2018T21:54:14,SuperLebensmude,XD
27-01-2018T21:56:15,Twokinds,I thought that went well.
27-01-2018T21:56:36,unsteddyphoenix,"In my unbiased opinion, I would say it was fantastic"
27-01-2018T21:56:51,RandomTKLover,"Gonna catch up on another stream, I have to pull an all nighter"
27-01-2018T21:56:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Jolly good show
27-01-2018T21:56:57,InTheLionsDen,It did. Great drawings.
27-01-2018T21:56:58,TheAngelsPlace,yeah it did
27-01-2018T21:57:01,w0lfmare,:cw0lfmare-AriahHappy:
27-01-2018T21:57:03,Saakra,"Damn, I always miss the streams by a little bit"
27-01-2018T21:57:09,RandomTKLover,Oh hi wolf
27-01-2018T21:57:44,microbuss,nuts Cyas
27-01-2018T21:57:47,Twokinds,"Well, there's always the timelaps ^^"
27-01-2018T21:57:48,unsteddyphoenix,"I like all the sketches this month actually, pretty decent hail"
27-01-2018T21:57:56,unsteddyphoenix,haul*
27-01-2018T21:57:59,Twokinds,"Yeah, this month was good."
27-01-2018T21:58:04,Twokinds,Lots of nice suggestions.
27-01-2018T21:58:39,Ordithus,I'm still blown away that the random sketch that wasn't even posted yet won!
27-01-2018T21:58:48,Twokinds,Yeah XD
27-01-2018T21:59:12,Twokinds,I wonder if it was actually because it was newer than all the others.
27-01-2018T21:59:18,Twokinds,Or if it was just the power of the tiger booty.
27-01-2018T21:59:23,Ordithus,Tiger booty.
27-01-2018T21:59:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,moneys on tiger booty
27-01-2018T21:59:33,InTheLionsDen,:ctwokinds-FloDance:
27-01-2018T21:59:42,BluePhantom90,Its the tigers Booty Tom
27-01-2018T21:59:49,unsteddyphoenix,I actually do think theres something like that
27-01-2018T21:59:57,unsteddyphoenix,I notice that the unposted ones often do well
27-01-2018T22:00:05,BluePhantom90,lol did you actually have to ask?
27-01-2018T22:00:23,Dadrobit,booty
27-01-2018T22:00:27,wolfspartan1,ello all
27-01-2018T22:00:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi wolf
27-01-2018T22:00:43,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe 'cause people look at it before voting and it's on their mind?
27-01-2018T22:00:51,wolfspartan1,hi marv
27-01-2018T22:00:53,Twokinds,"Could be, could be"
27-01-2018T22:01:04,Twokinds,"Though I don't think they'd vote for it if they didn't like it, regardless."
27-01-2018T22:01:25,Ordithus,"Perhaps next month, have an unposted stick figure in the running.  For science."
27-01-2018T22:01:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'd vote for that
27-01-2018T22:02:12,unsteddyphoenix,Oh of course
27-01-2018T22:02:18,Bgrmystr2,"ahh, missed the ending. Had to look away for a few mins. Thanks for streamin as always :D"
27-01-2018T22:02:24,Bgrmystr2,Great stuff today
27-01-2018T22:02:35,unsteddyphoenix,"It just seems to...influence them slightly, for whatever reason."
27-01-2018T22:03:22,Bgrmystr2,The unposted ones tend to do well probably because it's so recent in memory
27-01-2018T22:03:30,Bgrmystr2,so it plays a part in what people want
27-01-2018T22:03:42,Bgrmystr2,"instead of looking at the whole picture, people look at what they feel at that moment"
27-01-2018T22:03:47,unsteddyphoenix,Yup that is what I said earlier
27-01-2018T22:03:49,Bgrmystr2,and it sways their decision when voting
27-01-2018T22:03:55,unsteddyphoenix,"Though, just a hypothesis"
27-01-2018T22:04:14,Bgrmystr2,it would make the most sense
27-01-2018T22:05:00,unsteddyphoenix,"It could also be that, everyone has their own favourite characters and sketches, but everyone loves butts"
27-01-2018T22:05:08,unsteddyphoenix,And all 3 votes are weighted the same now
27-01-2018T22:05:51,Ordithus,"Everyone loves booty, and Flora's got a nice booty"
27-01-2018T22:06:23,BluePhantom90,I mean didn't we like the one with Nat saying her tail betrayed her. lol
27-01-2018T22:06:33,Bgrmystr2,lotta ppl like that one too
27-01-2018T22:06:50,Bgrmystr2,"traitor tail seems pretty popular, it seems"
27-01-2018T22:07:00,unsteddyphoenix,"If Flora was big as Natani, would her butt be huge? :thinking:"
27-01-2018T22:07:56,Bgrmystr2,"it would be bigger, just by sheer body size, of course"
27-01-2018T22:08:05,Bgrmystr2,"but more shapely, like kat? I dunno"
27-01-2018T22:10:29,BluePhantom90,"Hmmm would have more of a laugh with ""Flora trying Basitin female rituals""  kinda the joke with Keith and Laura"
27-01-2018T22:17:21,PalmettoPathfinder1,Hey what are y'all's opinion on dragons wearing armor as in scifi armor?
27-01-2018T22:18:12,Dadrobit,Proper sci-fi armor is just a force field.
27-01-2018T22:19:04,BluePhantom90,hmmm I can see that
27-01-2018T22:21:01,DarthRexKing,Night everyone.
27-01-2018T22:21:25,Dadrobit,cya darth
27-01-2018T22:22:34,PalmettoPathfinder1,"So Dadrobit, you prefer that dragons not be in scifi mecha armor?"
27-01-2018T22:27:05,wolfspartan1,cya guys
27-01-2018T22:38:24,RedDeath2018,Dang it I missed the final part
27-01-2018T22:39:43,RedDeath2018,Craaaaappppp
27-01-2018T22:40:03,RedDeath2018,Ok goodnight then guys see ya Wednesday
27-01-2018T22:40:19,RedDeath2018,Or whenever
27-01-2018T22:42:23,Dadrobit,"Sorry, went afk for food."
27-01-2018T22:42:54,Dadrobit,And I suppose I wouldn't want a dragon in mecha armor.
27-01-2018T22:42:59,Dadrobit,Seems... obtuse?
27-01-2018T22:43:13,Dadrobit,That's poorly worded.
27-01-2018T22:43:36,Dadrobit,It just doesn't seem neccessary to me. It's already a friggin dragon.
27-01-2018T22:43:59,Dadrobit,It's akin to puting friggin laser beams on sharks.
27-01-2018T22:44:04,Bgrmystr2,"Dragons are, you know, dragons.. they may as well be flying fucking TANKS"
27-01-2018T22:44:08,Bgrmystr2,they don't need extra armor
27-01-2018T22:44:29,Bgrmystr2,their hide itself is probably more resiliant than the strongest armor you can make for it.
27-01-2018T22:45:56,BluePhantom90,hmm but Dragons wouldn't want their scales badly damaged too. means they could be hurt more easily
27-01-2018T22:46:13,Bgrmystr2,I can see a few exceptions.. projectile prevention for one
27-01-2018T22:46:23,Dadrobit,Hence: forcefield.
27-01-2018T22:47:03,Bgrmystr2,"a shield that would prevent projectiles and physical forces, air pressure, etc"
27-01-2018T22:47:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,armor for dragons is like fashion souls for dark souls players
27-01-2018T22:47:13,Bgrmystr2,xDD
27-01-2018T22:47:18,FenceEqualizer,Marv gets it
27-01-2018T22:47:19,Dadrobit,But... I like that
27-01-2018T22:47:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,me too
27-01-2018T22:47:32,FenceEqualizer,The most logic answer I've seen yet
27-01-2018T22:47:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,gotta look cool while kicking ass
27-01-2018T22:47:41,Dadrobit,I'm not such a fan of dragon armor.
27-01-2018T22:48:07,Bgrmystr2,"Dragons wearing armor would be the same thing as us wearing clothes,"
27-01-2018T22:48:13,unsteddyphoenix,Only aesthetic dragon armour
27-01-2018T22:48:14,BluePhantom90,I have a story a dragon wanted a suit of Human armor for its collection. ( collecting art and so on)
27-01-2018T22:48:22,Dadrobit,"When I played DS3, I did everything I could to make myself look like a Bloodborne character"
27-01-2018T22:48:33,FenceEqualizer,Designer armor for fashion.  Who says you can't look good while destroying towns?
27-01-2018T22:48:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Bloodborne armor is the best looking imo
27-01-2018T22:49:00,Bgrmystr2,Dragons already look badass without armor..
27-01-2018T22:49:10,Dadrobit,"Agreed, Lady Maria was a BAMF"
27-01-2018T22:49:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,^
27-01-2018T22:49:56,FenceEqualizer,No arguments here.
27-01-2018T22:50:21,Dadrobit,"Probably my favorite boss, if not tied with Orphan of Kos."
27-01-2018T22:50:37,Dadrobit,Such cinematic fights.
27-01-2018T22:51:22,FenceEqualizer,She doesn't top Gehrmen though
27-01-2018T22:51:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"My Fav is Amelia, just for the fact that she looks like Falcore"
27-01-2018T22:52:52,Dadrobit,"Disagree, Fence. I found Gherman fun, but kind of laughably easy."
27-01-2018T22:54:44,FenceEqualizer,Ergo...can't argue that either. Did a no heal run to make him more challenging. But difficulty aside I love his theme and just overall design better.
27-01-2018T22:55:20,FenceEqualizer,Freaking old bastard got up from his wheel chair because the main hunter needed a caning.
27-01-2018T22:57:51,FenceEqualizer,Ironically Lady Maria started off strong then went too anime for me.
27-01-2018T22:58:30,BluePhantom90,Hey Tom so do Dragons still collect art and gold and so on? Like how normal dragons act sometimes?
27-01-2018T22:58:51,Dadrobit,The fact that she had 3 stages insead of 2? Or just her fighting style?
27-01-2018T22:59:56,FenceEqualizer,Fighting style. The blood fire while freaking awesome knock her down a peg
27-01-2018T23:01:13,Dadrobit,I thought it was badass. Especially when it started erupting into flame as well.
27-01-2018T23:01:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,same
27-01-2018T23:01:46,Dadrobit,And doesn't Gherman have something similar in his second stage?
27-01-2018T23:01:59,Dadrobit,Haven't fought him in a while.
27-01-2018T23:03:19,Dadrobit,"Or... No, he just has his spirit bomb."
27-01-2018T23:03:24,Dadrobit,Speaking of anime.
27-01-2018T23:03:31,FenceEqualizer,It is badass like absolutely. Gehrman did get a power up from the moon but other then one attack he still felt like I was fighting a hunter
27-01-2018T23:03:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
27-01-2018T23:03:38,Twokinds,"Not really. Most dragons don't, anyway."
27-01-2018T23:04:22,unsteddyphoenix,They just act like mercenaries I think
27-01-2018T23:05:10,FenceEqualizer,Why I have him up a smidge higher then Lady Maria.
27-01-2018T23:06:12,FenceEqualizer,Dragons shed their materialistic ways? Blasphemy!
27-01-2018T23:06:15,Dadrobit,Did you enjoy the bloody crow of cainhurst?
27-01-2018T23:06:31,FenceEqualizer,How can they put bling the peons?
27-01-2018T23:07:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"crow of cainhurst, the hardest boss in the whole game"
27-01-2018T23:07:37,Dadrobit,Fucking. Agreed.
27-01-2018T23:07:56,FenceEqualizer,Hmm been a while but from what I remember. Bastard was a button reading jerk with way too much healing. So yeah like the little brawl
27-01-2018T23:08:37,Dadrobit,Don't forget the one-shot-kill gun he had no issue with spamming!
27-01-2018T23:09:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I don't know who was harder the crow or dark eater midir from ds3, leaning towards the Xrow"
27-01-2018T23:09:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,cow
27-01-2018T23:09:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,crow
27-01-2018T23:10:07,FenceEqualizer,"Oh god, crow had to be crow"
27-01-2018T23:10:16,Dadrobit,"Good question, I never did beat the DS3 dlc. Midir brickwalled me pretty darn hard."
27-01-2018T23:10:21,FenceEqualizer,Has
27-01-2018T23:10:27,BluePhantom90,TOM you should try to sell this on Twokinds lol https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/332727437316194305/407386873472745492/unknown_001.png
27-01-2018T23:10:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Midir is a bitch to fight, had to throw myself at him for what felt like days"
27-01-2018T23:11:14,Bgrmystr2,lol bags on tails
27-01-2018T23:11:15,Dadrobit,"But yeah, Crow just generated alllllll the rage."
27-01-2018T23:11:28,Bgrmystr2,"I guess it would depend on who wanted the bag, and how strong their tail is"
27-01-2018T23:11:37,Bgrmystr2,"cuz a bag, even small, can get really heavy"
27-01-2018T23:11:42,PalmettoPathfinder1,Everyone have a good night!  I love y'all!
27-01-2018T23:11:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"yeah, Midir was a pissed off abyss dragon, while the Crow was just some dude"
27-01-2018T23:11:47,unsteddyphoenix,thicctaild
27-01-2018T23:11:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,nighty night Palm
27-01-2018T23:11:57,Bgrmystr2,"and if they use that tail for balance, then it's highly important that it stays as agile as possible"
27-01-2018T23:12:02,Dadrobit,"Midir I think is easier to predict, so I could blame myself for losses."
27-01-2018T23:12:08,Dadrobit,cya palm
27-01-2018T23:12:16,FenceEqualizer,All I remember from midir was being force to stare at the dragons crotch as it was the only safe area to stay alive
27-01-2018T23:12:29,FenceEqualizer,Night palm
27-01-2018T23:12:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"problem with midir is when I fought him he had not wait time, just always going go, go, go"
27-01-2018T23:13:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,kinda like blood starved if blood starved flew and shot shin Godzilla lazers
27-01-2018T23:14:27,FenceEqualizer,Lasers should not shoot from there
27-01-2018T23:14:43,Dadrobit,The thing that got me about Midir was that laser blast where he would just spray it everywhere. That thing killed me Every Time!
27-01-2018T23:14:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,same here
27-01-2018T23:15:54,FenceEqualizer,For the life of me I do not remember him shooting lasers
27-01-2018T23:16:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,midir shot lasers
27-01-2018T23:16:12,Dadrobit,"Oh yeah, hekamehameha'd all the time."
27-01-2018T23:16:40,Dadrobit,kamehameha'd*
27-01-2018T23:16:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,he will look at the ground then breath fire which got condensed into a death laser of hate and anger
27-01-2018T23:17:49,Dadrobit,Ad probably radiation
27-01-2018T23:17:50,FenceEqualizer,Oh god! How did I forget that!? Just had to look at a vid
27-01-2018T23:17:52,Dadrobit,and*
27-01-2018T23:17:59,FenceEqualizer,That killed me so much
27-01-2018T23:20:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,one of the coolest things in the whole game and it was the source of all the rage
27-01-2018T23:21:18,Dadrobit,"Well, the 3 stage boss at the end of the painted world got me to rage a fair bit as well."
27-01-2018T23:21:24,FenceEqualizer,Probably why people would subconsciously block it from memory. The rage
27-01-2018T23:22:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,why do dlc boss'es have to be so hard in ds3
27-01-2018T23:22:44,Dadrobit,Main game was legit kind of easy.
27-01-2018T23:23:07,FenceEqualizer,To inflate hours spent on the game
27-01-2018T23:23:36,FenceEqualizer,Don't mind it though
27-01-2018T23:23:48,Dadrobit,I honestly can't recall a boss from vanilla
27-01-2018T23:23:57,Dadrobit,that was super difficult
27-01-2018T23:24:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"nameless king, that one got me a bit"
27-01-2018T23:24:24,Dadrobit,I actually really liked that fight.
27-01-2018T23:24:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Its a cool fight, love that its just him, you and the storm"
27-01-2018T23:24:48,Dadrobit,"Took me a good 4 tries the first time, but it wasn't like ridiculaous or anything."
27-01-2018T23:25:20,Dadrobit,ridiculous*
27-01-2018T23:25:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,took me about 5 times until I went from strength to dex then he got kinda easy
27-01-2018T23:26:27,Bgrmystr2,I still love your img fence
27-01-2018T23:27:57,FenceEqualizer,"Haha, thanks"
27-01-2018T23:31:28,FenceEqualizer,Going to change it one day.
27-01-2018T23:32:28,FenceEqualizer,You know I think nameless was the hardest boss in ds3 vanilla.
27-01-2018T23:44:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Ya'll
27-01-2018T23:45:45,FenceEqualizer,Night marv
27-01-2018T23:46:59,Dadrobit,night marv
