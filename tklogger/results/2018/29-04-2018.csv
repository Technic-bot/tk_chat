29-04-2018T00:01:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"To give you a better sale of the kitten’s size, I have an iPhone 6s+. He is as long as the phone and about as tall"
29-04-2018T00:01:49,SpazztasticKiwi,*scale
29-04-2018T00:01:56,TheBeckoner,needs grow
29-04-2018T00:02:06,TheBeckoner,water cat to grow
29-04-2018T00:02:08,TheBeckoner,wait
29-04-2018T00:02:11,TheBeckoner,dont do that
29-04-2018T00:02:21,Vatruvius,"They should be small at that age though, yes?"
29-04-2018T00:03:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"About, but he’s also a stray of sorts. We don’t know his exact age, and approximating age is based on size and teeth"
29-04-2018T00:03:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"If his growth is stunted, his age won’t be portrayed as accuratly"
29-04-2018T00:03:49,SpazztasticKiwi,*accurately
29-04-2018T00:05:14,Vatruvius,I see.
29-04-2018T00:08:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"We know Kiwi’s birthday since the last I got her from knew, but she was also the runt of the two litters born in that house. So while she’s actually 7, she’s a little shorter and has a smaller face, particularly her nose, though that could be due to her"
29-04-2018T00:08:48,SpazztasticKiwi,possibly having Persian in her
29-04-2018T00:22:27,SiliconCarbide,oh wow another 7h stream
29-04-2018T00:22:48,DRAGONTANOPUG,I just realized tom started filing in keiths eyes with white in chapter 19
29-04-2018T00:23:36,Vatruvius,My older dog Cosmo was the runt of his family. He is rather large for his breed so I do not know what the rest of his siblings were like.
29-04-2018T00:24:20,Vatruvius,You just realized that?
29-04-2018T00:24:51,DRAGONTANOPUG,Well... yes and no
29-04-2018T00:25:08,DRAGONTANOPUG,I always thot they were white.
29-04-2018T00:25:18,Vatruvius,Nope.
29-04-2018T00:25:25,DRAGONTANOPUG,I know
29-04-2018T00:25:43,DRAGONTANOPUG,Im looking at a page with his eyes not filled in
29-04-2018T00:27:20,TheBeckoner,yeah they used to just be yellow
29-04-2018T00:31:10,TheBeckoner,huh seems that on page 943 they are randomly white
29-04-2018T00:31:22,Dadrobit,His sclera is an indication of his mental state.
29-04-2018T00:31:26,Vatruvius,Hmm.
29-04-2018T00:31:43,Vatruvius,His what?
29-04-2018T00:32:09,Dadrobit,The white part of the eye is the sclera
29-04-2018T00:32:46,Dadrobit,They appear on him when he approaches a mental state that resembles happiness.
29-04-2018T00:32:54,Vatruvius,Huh...how does that indicate his mental state?
29-04-2018T00:32:59,Vatruvius,Really?
29-04-2018T00:33:15,Dadrobit,"It was a joke, then Tom made it real more or less."
29-04-2018T00:34:50,Vatruvius,"I see, it appears more like a style or design change. However, Keith's sclera does disappear in some scenes like shock or embarrassment."
29-04-2018T00:35:34,Dadrobit,The joke started on page 943 iirc.
29-04-2018T00:35:59,TheBeckoner,first time I found it
29-04-2018T00:36:29,Dadrobit,"Anyhow, I'm gonna head  off for a bit. Still got work to be done."
29-04-2018T00:36:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Well it has been proven that your pupil expands when looking at someone you love
29-04-2018T00:36:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Or something
29-04-2018T00:37:29,TheBeckoner,gl Dadro
29-04-2018T00:37:39,Bgrmystr2,alright dadro
29-04-2018T00:37:44,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
29-04-2018T00:37:48,unsteddyphoenix,Night dad
29-04-2018T00:38:03,unsteddyphoenix,It's said that keith's sclera grew 3 sizes that day...
29-04-2018T00:38:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Keith just might be in love
29-04-2018T00:39:18,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s also supposed to be one of the ways you can tell if someone’s interested in you when you’re in a conversation
29-04-2018T00:39:20,Vatruvius,"""Well, it has been proven that X happens or something."" ~ Kiwi :ptv-tease:"
29-04-2018T00:39:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"For me, the science is eh"
29-04-2018T00:40:16,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s other ways to tell if they’re interested anyway
29-04-2018T00:40:55,Vatruvius,"I think it would be correct to say Keith is in love, albeit coplicated love, but love none the less."
29-04-2018T00:41:02,TheBeckoner,"""are you interested?"" works well"
29-04-2018T00:42:52,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s probably the beat way to find out. Especially since being nice and being polite run at the same wavelength
29-04-2018T00:43:07,SpazztasticKiwi,*best
29-04-2018T00:43:31,Vatruvius,Why can family completely invert your mood in a matter of seconds?!
29-04-2018T00:43:43,SpazztasticKiwi,And being nice/polite does not necessarily equal interested
29-04-2018T00:48:46,SiliconCarbide,an expanded pupil can also indicate drug use though
29-04-2018T00:52:12,Bgrmystr2,not quite the same way
29-04-2018T00:52:29,Bgrmystr2,that's like.. extreme case expanded
29-04-2018T00:53:00,Bgrmystr2,it's not going to be nearly that level of difference just based on whether someone likes what they're watching
29-04-2018T00:53:20,SpazztasticKiwi,“Am I high or are you hot?”
29-04-2018T00:53:25,TheBeckoner,Welp I got a speech to give tomorrow so bed is good. goodnight y'all
29-04-2018T00:53:41,SpazztasticKiwi,“Both from the looks of it”
29-04-2018T00:53:42,Bgrmystr2,gnight Beck
29-04-2018T00:54:23,Bgrmystr2,"""Am I hot or are you high?""  .. ""You're drunk. Go home."""
29-04-2018T00:55:22,SiliconCarbide,"""maybe im high on you?"""
29-04-2018T00:55:39,Bgrmystr2,lol that's just being creepy
29-04-2018T00:56:12,SiliconCarbide,quite
29-04-2018T00:56:51,Twokinds,I should sleep...
29-04-2018T00:57:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Well why don’t you?
29-04-2018T00:57:06,Vatruvius,Good night guys. My mood has been thoroughly trashed.
29-04-2018T00:57:11,SpazztasticKiwi,We can’t be that captivating
29-04-2018T00:57:12,unsteddyphoenix,ehhh~
29-04-2018T00:58:12,unsteddyphoenix,But sleeping means no more media for a while
29-04-2018T00:58:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Or are the allergies poking you in the sinuses?
29-04-2018T00:58:19,unsteddyphoenix,Dislike
29-04-2018T00:59:12,Twokinds,Allergies are just starting to steamroll me.
29-04-2018T00:59:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Ouch
29-04-2018T00:59:25,Twokinds,Trying to push through the headfog. It's the worst.
29-04-2018T00:59:36,SpazztasticKiwi,:ptv-whiny:
29-04-2018T00:59:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Think you’re gonna die?
29-04-2018T01:00:11,Twokinds,Well it's not like that.
29-04-2018T01:00:18,unsteddyphoenix,What is a headfog like?
29-04-2018T01:00:22,Twokinds,It's just a miserable tiredness.
29-04-2018T01:00:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Naps
29-04-2018T01:00:31,unsteddyphoenix,hm.
29-04-2018T01:00:32,Twokinds,"Like, hard to focus."
29-04-2018T01:00:52,Twokinds,"Then again, that might also just be a side effect of the allergy meds."
29-04-2018T01:00:58,unsteddyphoenix,The only allergic reaction ive had caused swelling and rashes but didnt do anything to me mentally.
29-04-2018T01:01:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’d say coffee, but I heard your machine broke"
29-04-2018T01:01:04,unsteddyphoenix,"Lol, thats true"
29-04-2018T01:01:12,Twokinds,"I use Flonase, which isn't supposed to cause drowsiness or anything like that."
29-04-2018T01:01:15,Twokinds,But I dunno.
29-04-2018T01:01:34,SpazztasticKiwi,*not supposed to*
29-04-2018T01:01:38,unsteddyphoenix,Can you not sleep for some reason?
29-04-2018T01:01:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Key words
29-04-2018T01:02:01,Twokinds,I've been having vivid lucid dreams lately.
29-04-2018T01:02:10,Twokinds,"Which is cool, but I wake up feeling unrested."
29-04-2018T01:02:33,unsteddyphoenix,Yoo i've always wanted to have lucid dreams~
29-04-2018T01:02:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Coffee withdrawal could be the reason for that
29-04-2018T01:02:49,SpazztasticKiwi,*Caffeine
29-04-2018T01:02:57,unsteddyphoenix,"I wanted to try like, make them happen but I heard sleep paralysis comes along with it."
29-04-2018T01:03:09,Twokinds,"I usually only dream when I'm having troubled sleep. Which makes sense, since I assume remembering dreams requires waking up, or being near awake."
29-04-2018T01:03:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Brian may be unconsciously worried about something
29-04-2018T01:03:35,SpazztasticKiwi,*brain
29-04-2018T01:03:47,unsteddyphoenix,I think I read once that you always dream but you forget most of them instantly.
29-04-2018T01:03:50,Twokinds,I'm pretty stressed.
29-04-2018T01:03:57,SpazztasticKiwi,No bueno
29-04-2018T01:04:10,unsteddyphoenix,More than normal? Or has this amount become the norm
29-04-2018T01:04:14,Twokinds,"Yeah It's always been my experience that I'm always dreaming, but 99.9% of it gets forgotten immediately."
29-04-2018T01:04:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’d say pet Holly, as petting an animal can relieve stress and lower blood pressure, but..."
29-04-2018T01:04:35,unsteddyphoenix,most of the time I dont remembever even having a dream at all
29-04-2018T01:04:57,Twokinds,The stress is mostly just a feeling of being stuck in a rut.
29-04-2018T01:05:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"Your making progress. It’s not fast, no, but it’s moving"
29-04-2018T01:05:29,SpazztasticKiwi,*you’re
29-04-2018T01:05:33,unsteddyphoenix,"Mmm, i see. Maybe that'll change when you eventually move?"
29-04-2018T01:05:40,Twokinds,"I want to move, but feel a bit trapped by my family and cat. And also nerves about living on my own."
29-04-2018T01:05:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Trapped by family...?
29-04-2018T01:06:06,unsteddyphoenix,"I dont want to try, but do your family want you to stay or somethin"
29-04-2018T01:06:09,unsteddyphoenix,*pry
29-04-2018T01:06:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Me either. Spill if only you want
29-04-2018T01:07:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"Moving out to somewhere unknown, keeping up your own business, planning to go to a con soon, and a possible trip to Korea"
29-04-2018T01:08:02,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s a wonder you’re still sane honestly
29-04-2018T01:08:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Especially rn
29-04-2018T01:08:46,Twokinds,I'm not sure what will happen to my mother if I move away.
29-04-2018T01:09:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"She should be ok. Lonely, but I can see what you mean"
29-04-2018T01:09:22,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh. That type of situation.
29-04-2018T01:10:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"My sister’s staying with my mom while I’m moving out. Not only are they a little more closer to each other, but my mom’s not really in the shape to live alone"
29-04-2018T01:10:53,Twokinds,"My biggest fear is that I move, she later sells her house and needs a place to stay. Then it's back to square one again."
29-04-2018T01:11:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh
29-04-2018T01:11:30,unsteddyphoenix,I guess...cross that bridge when you come to it? What else can you do really.
29-04-2018T01:11:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Seems you’re kinda in the same situation as my sister
29-04-2018T01:12:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Though my sister stays because she doesn’t want to leave home and my mom’s a bit if a fall risk
29-04-2018T01:12:36,unsteddyphoenix,"For the record you seem like a very competent person, im sure you'll be fine on your own. If the worst case does end up happening then maybe there'll be a new solution at that point."
29-04-2018T01:14:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe you could move into a house just a neighborhood or two over...?
29-04-2018T01:18:36,Twokinds,"Eh, the taxes in this village are crazy."
29-04-2018T01:19:42,Twokinds,"I'd want to move a little bit farther from the city, into some of the more open areas."
29-04-2018T01:21:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Right. Cabin in the woods guy
29-04-2018T01:21:23,unsteddyphoenix,Does the internet get worse further from the city? It's like that here
29-04-2018T01:21:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don’t know Ohio, so can’t help there"
29-04-2018T01:22:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"We live out in the woods here. 4ish miles from the city, and our internet is fine"
29-04-2018T01:23:05,SpazztasticKiwi,My grandma streams movies almost nightly
29-04-2018T01:38:53,TorqueEmUp,Maybe move into a township instead of a town?
29-04-2018T01:39:13,Twokinds,I don't know enough about lines on a map to know the difference.
29-04-2018T01:39:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Hopefully you’ll find something. At least you’re house hunting for a single person
29-04-2018T01:39:21,TorqueEmUp,lol
29-04-2018T01:39:35,TorqueEmUp,I just know you can avoid city tax if you live in a township.
29-04-2018T01:39:38,Twokinds,I'm not sure why one house has 6k taxes and one block over it's 3k taxes
29-04-2018T01:39:47,SpazztasticKiwi,You don’t know how to read a map?
29-04-2018T01:40:14,SpazztasticKiwi,That can be due to anything from flood to earthquake risk of the areas
29-04-2018T01:40:46,Twokinds,"Also, I ended up continuing working on these drawings after the stream lol."
29-04-2018T01:41:04,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s a given. Workaholic
29-04-2018T01:41:20,TorqueEmUp,"Granted I've seen like 300k+ homes on one side of a street, and a trailer park on the other."
29-04-2018T01:42:36,TorqueEmUp,Also the amount of land the house is on probably plays a big part in the higher taxes
29-04-2018T01:42:38,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s zoning for you
29-04-2018T01:43:14,TorqueEmUp,and so many other little things add on taxes too.
29-04-2018T01:43:44,TorqueEmUp,"like just having a slab of concrete, or pavement in your back yard for a back patio will add to taxes."
29-04-2018T01:44:37,unsteddyphoenix,Wow. Is that just a technicality thing?
29-04-2018T01:46:14,TorqueEmUp,well kinda more than a slab. Like my folk's have a back patio that is roughly a 15' by 15' square of concrete.
29-04-2018T01:48:15,TorqueEmUp,I just remember my father saying they could save money on their taxes if they were to to remove it.
29-04-2018T01:48:26,TorqueEmUp,or something
29-04-2018T01:49:00,unsteddyphoenix,Hmm
29-04-2018T01:50:00,unsteddyphoenix,Well if it's just minor things like that no reason not to go for the cheaper one?
29-04-2018T01:50:45,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, also any extra structures add to taxes."
29-04-2018T01:51:09,TorqueEmUp,"like a barn, detatched garage."
29-04-2018T01:51:23,TorqueEmUp,supply shed
29-04-2018T01:52:12,TorqueEmUp,Probably depends on the area too
29-04-2018T01:52:22,TorqueEmUp,on what is taxed and what is not of course.
29-04-2018T01:52:40,TorqueEmUp,I am very far from an expert on this
29-04-2018T01:53:01,TorqueEmUp,this is all just kinda just random knowledge i've gathered over the years.
29-04-2018T01:53:51,unsteddyphoenix,Lol pretty much noone in my family owns a house so I know jac
29-04-2018T01:56:53,Twokinds,Gave the Adelaide one a simple background
29-04-2018T01:57:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Solid color or simple pattern
29-04-2018T01:57:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Or simple landscape
29-04-2018T01:57:30,Twokinds,Uh... sort of a tribal hut wall
29-04-2018T01:57:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Simple landscape then
29-04-2018T01:58:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Sounds fitting for her
29-04-2018T01:58:17,Twokinds,"Also, improved the lighting of Maren and Raine a bit. Also, now Raine is providing her own steam via blushing."
29-04-2018T01:58:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Aw poor Raine
29-04-2018T01:58:43,TorqueEmUp,ahh she's fiiine
29-04-2018T01:58:48,unsteddyphoenix,Oh I liiiike that
29-04-2018T01:58:56,unsteddyphoenix,POWERFUL blush
29-04-2018T02:01:36,Dadrobit,Back for a bit. My project is being a butt.
29-04-2018T02:02:20,Twokinds,Also there's more hotsprings in the background
29-04-2018T02:02:49,Twokinds,Just don't fall into Spring of Drowned Squirrel
29-04-2018T02:03:06,Dadrobit,Ew
29-04-2018T02:03:10,SiliconCarbide,gross
29-04-2018T02:03:38,BadFoMo,Who falls in?
29-04-2018T02:04:44,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock:
29-04-2018T02:05:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Only reason you fall into a hot spring is if you’re not paying attention to where you’re going or you’re running
29-04-2018T02:05:14,Twokinds,or fighting
29-04-2018T02:05:14,Dadrobit,Who falls in? At least one squirrel.
29-04-2018T02:05:20,unsteddyphoenix,Bonus nibbly??
29-04-2018T02:05:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Who’s fighting in a hot spring? It’s sweaty enough in there
29-04-2018T02:05:36,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:
29-04-2018T02:06:11,unsteddyphoenix,Or stealing
29-04-2018T02:06:11,Bgrmystr2,"if it's inside, that's more likely to be a sauna, Kiwi"
29-04-2018T02:06:16,BadFoMo,[Database error] and Sythe?
29-04-2018T02:06:17,Bgrmystr2,Hot springs tend to be outside
29-04-2018T02:06:41,Bgrmystr2,you're more wet from the water than the sweat
29-04-2018T02:08:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Kitten needs attention hold on
29-04-2018T02:10:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera is instantly angry
29-04-2018T02:15:31,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-flomad:
29-04-2018T02:17:26,Dadrobit,"That reminds me, I never had dinner."
29-04-2018T02:17:48,Twokinds,Nibbly added
29-04-2018T02:17:49,Dadrobit,Probably why I was going bonkers on my project.
29-04-2018T02:17:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Ever tried to keep track of a waddling kitten while dishing out food for it and cleaning its bed?
29-04-2018T02:17:59,Dadrobit,Yes

29-04-2018T02:22:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"Meanwhile, Bagheera’s literally grumbling in the corner"
29-04-2018T02:25:09,Bgrmystr2,Love how Phoenix continues to ignore the feelings of the cat's owner and only thinks of the benefits of the cat. :v
29-04-2018T02:25:28,DarthRexKing,I am going to bed. Goodbye.
29-04-2018T02:25:32,Dadrobit,Night

29-04-2018T02:25:42,unsteddyphoenix,Only the latter is relevant
29-04-2018T02:25:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"This guy’s not qualified to be a cat. He’s like, a quarter of a cat"
29-04-2018T02:26:04,Dadrobit,"Defrosting some tilapia, gonna make some noodles to go with it."
29-04-2018T02:26:06,Bgrmystr2,Phoenix is human version of cat.
29-04-2018T02:26:49,BadFoMo,A Furry?
29-04-2018T02:27:56,BadFoMo,"Wait, that joke doesn't work. Scratch that."
29-04-2018T02:31:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Is that’s over with...what are we all doing now
29-04-2018T02:31:38,SpazztasticKiwi,While Bagheera gets over his tantrum in the corner...
29-04-2018T02:32:42,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-katdryer: he sulk
29-04-2018T02:35:51,unsteddyphoenix,I'm gonna watch doctor strange cause apparently it's a prerequisite to the new avengers
29-04-2018T02:36:17,Dadrobit,Oh yeah
29-04-2018T02:36:19,Dadrobit,Mandatory
29-04-2018T02:37:53,unsteddyphoenix,Is black panther too?
29-04-2018T02:38:44,Dadrobit,"Yeah, that's up there."
29-04-2018T02:39:11,Dadrobit,Also Spiderman. Tom Holland's acting is actually amazing.
29-04-2018T02:39:27,unsteddyphoenix,That one I've seen
29-04-2018T02:39:34,Twokinds,Thanks! But I'm actually from Ohio.
29-04-2018T02:39:36,Dadrobit,Thor Ragnarok?
29-04-2018T02:39:47,Dadrobit,I get it.
29-04-2018T02:40:03,Dadrobit,Took me a sec.
29-04-2018T02:40:06,Dadrobit,But I get it.
29-04-2018T02:42:04,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
29-04-2018T02:42:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I see you cut and died your hair for that roll
29-04-2018T02:43:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Never noticed how many Toms there are and I follow until now
29-04-2018T02:45:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"Haven’t seen Ragnarok, Infinity War, or the new Spider-Man"
29-04-2018T02:45:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Or Black Panther
29-04-2018T02:46:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"With as many hot guys running around in those movies, you think I would have by now though"
29-04-2018T02:46:16,Dadrobit,I ~think~ I've seen every Marvel movie to date...
29-04-2018T02:47:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom Hiddleson’s more my taste though
29-04-2018T02:48:35,Dadrobit,Hahahahaha! You NEEED to see Infinity War then.
29-04-2018T02:48:36,SpazztasticKiwi,*Hiddleston
29-04-2018T02:49:16,unsteddyphoenix,The hot guys are a lot of girls sole reason for seeing them lol
29-04-2018T02:49:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Still too old for me unfortunately. And he’s taken
29-04-2018T02:49:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Probably like his snarkiness more than anything
29-04-2018T02:51:34,Dadrobit,Can confirm anecdotally. Saw large groups of young girls interspersed by the occasional guy. Very large female population comparatively.
29-04-2018T02:52:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"Too much fan service, maybe? Personally, I don’t see why everyone seems to be so obsessed with some of these guys"
29-04-2018T02:53:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"Yippee, they’re hot. And...?"
29-04-2018T02:54:12,unsteddyphoenix,Unfortunately I couldn't tell you. I don't really care about actor/actresses
29-04-2018T02:57:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Work tomorrow. Not tired
29-04-2018T02:58:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I missed both charity streams too
29-04-2018T02:58:16,Dadrobit,"Okay, fish is properly defrosted, gonna get down to cooking."

29-04-2018T13:52:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Am at work and was like, I know that smell"
29-04-2018T13:52:57,BadFoMo,Inb4 Albion's hands are hidden by... something.
29-04-2018T13:53:05,Dadrobit,Are there other scents you can detect via stream?

29-04-2018T14:10:42,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, I clicked it, but I just get the Please stand by playing."

29-04-2018T14:10:57,Bgrmystr2,so it's still there
29-04-2018T14:11:13,PalmettoPathfinder1,Exit out of it and then try doing it.
29-04-2018T14:11:13,Bgrmystr2,sounds like your connectivity more like
29-04-2018T14:11:25,Bgrmystr2,I already did..?
29-04-2018T14:11:41,Bgrmystr2,It's playing again
29-04-2018T14:11:41,neropan,helluu
29-04-2018T14:11:54,PhilTheIdle,Hello
29-04-2018T14:12:08,Bgrmystr2,"so yeah, prolly your connectivity, or something between you and picarto"
29-04-2018T14:12:12,Bgrmystr2,cuz it's not deleted
29-04-2018T14:12:33,ZoopBoopLoop,Christmas in April...?
29-04-2018T14:13:18,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Hm....It must have been Picarto then.  As soon as I refreshed and log off and back onto Picarto, it appeared."
29-04-2018T14:13:39,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"That's the website, playing games with you lol"
29-04-2018T14:14:00,Bgrmystr2,the website doesn't automatically load the stream recordings
29-04-2018T14:14:24,Twokinds,"Yeah,you know, the old saying."
29-04-2018T14:14:30,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Nothing's wrong with my connectivity as the current stream is working just fine.  Yep, KopyKat was correct."
29-04-2018T14:14:32,Bgrmystr2,"you have to reload your page for it to show up, to click it"
29-04-2018T14:14:52,Bgrmystr2,"Kopy was being a face, websites don't play games, they're code, bro xD"
29-04-2018T14:15:12,Bgrmystr2,"and picarto isn't a game, so it's not even that you could use that excuse"
29-04-2018T14:15:14,Twokinds,"If the May showers doesn't bring the April groundhog's shadow, then it's 3 more months of Christmas."
29-04-2018T14:15:24,FoxxTrotter,You wish.
29-04-2018T14:15:28,FoxxTrotter,^_^
29-04-2018T14:15:37,PalmettoPathfinder1,Oh really?  You didn't hear about the computer AI that turned into a Neo-Nazi porn star?
29-04-2018T14:15:50,Bgrmystr2,"Lol Tom, I recall there was at least some truth to that."
29-04-2018T14:15:59,Bgrmystr2,"I don't know what, exactly, it's based on though"
29-04-2018T14:16:39,Bgrmystr2,and fairly sure that has nothin to do with picarto palm XD
29-04-2018T14:16:57,Soundbytee,"Straight Christmas, not just the winter. Woot! More Christmas music"
29-04-2018T14:17:40,Dadrobit,Michael Buble will be so happy to hear about this!
29-04-2018T14:17:44,Bgrmystr2,even though it's not christmas music..? O.o
29-04-2018T14:17:55,PalmettoPathfinder1,I know but it just shows to go that technology doesn't always work the way we want it to.
29-04-2018T14:18:09,Soundbytee,Lol
29-04-2018T14:18:11,Bgrmystr2,I think it's the lack of knowledge that's the problem here lol
29-04-2018T14:18:47,Dadrobit,"""Baby it's cold outside!"""
29-04-2018T14:19:10,PhilTheIdle,I love 40s songs.
29-04-2018T14:19:14,PalmettoPathfinder1,Microsoft unveiled Tay a chatbot that became a racist Neo-Nazi porn star.
29-04-2018T14:19:25,PalmettoPathfinder1,After only a few moments chatting with people.  :P
29-04-2018T14:19:28,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah, I know, and I know why it happened, and it actually made sense."
29-04-2018T14:19:34,Bgrmystr2,unlike what you're implying :v
29-04-2018T14:19:56,Bgrmystr2,"You should get soem of that cold, Dadro"
29-04-2018T14:20:00,Bgrmystr2,get rid of the heat
29-04-2018T14:20:13,Bgrmystr2,stahp being so 100+
29-04-2018T14:20:41,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Yeah I know what happened too, but I find it odd that the programmers didn't except that sort of thing to happen.  You would think that they would build a better filter into the blasted thing."
29-04-2018T14:20:59,Dadrobit,"Sure, I'll just take a day trip up to Greer, that'll go over well on the wallet."
29-04-2018T14:21:04,Bgrmystr2,no. because it was an experiment lol xD
29-04-2018T14:21:12,Bgrmystr2,purpose matters
29-04-2018T14:21:23,Bgrmystr2,"sure, dadro. I'm sure you can just leg it."
29-04-2018T14:21:24,FoxxTrotter,"Greer, South Carolina? That's a long trip. ;0P"
29-04-2018T14:21:36,FoxxTrotter,"Heh, I sure you meant somewhere else."
29-04-2018T14:21:46,Bgrmystr2,"You didn't skip leg day, did you?"
29-04-2018T14:22:07,Dadrobit,Naw we have a mountain top resort town down here in AZ. Can get snow or at least hail all year round up there.
29-04-2018T14:22:19,Bgrmystr2,ooo sounds cool
29-04-2018T14:22:29,FoxxTrotter,"Yeah, Greer is a city in South Carolin between Greenville and Spartanburg."
29-04-2018T14:22:35,Dadrobit,"Surrounded by forest, very pretty area."
29-04-2018T14:22:43,Soundbytee,Sounds like the least AZ part of AZ
29-04-2018T14:23:52,Dadrobit,We actually have a lot of high snowy mountan-y areas here. But 95% of the population lives in Phoenix or its surrounding area.
29-04-2018T14:24:12,FoxxTrotter,One of my former classmates lives in Show Low.
29-04-2018T14:24:15,Dadrobit,(slight exaggeration of course)
29-04-2018T14:24:17,PalmettoPathfinder1,"South Carolina has a lot of beautiful places.  Aiken, SC was name the top best small town in Southern Living Magazine (boy did the entire Aiken County go nuts over that.  No one could keep the magazine in stock!)"
29-04-2018T14:24:47,Soundbytee,Beautiful sights in those snowy areas?
29-04-2018T14:25:02,PalmettoPathfinder1,Yep.
29-04-2018T14:25:19,Dadrobit,"I think Flagstaff has won a couple of those awards for ""best place ever"" or the like."

29-04-2018T14:32:19,PhilTheIdle,"Just that I'm not wrong: The dude in the middle is Alabaster, right?"
29-04-2018T14:32:35,ItsActuallyKopyKat,ayup
29-04-2018T14:32:37,Bgrmystr2,"yeh it's natani and zen, and yeah I think so"

29-04-2018T14:34:05,PhilTheIdle,Hey
29-04-2018T14:34:06,Yosshq,Hey ^^
29-04-2018T14:34:52,TheFDdriver,"is that ""a basitin Christmas"" or something like that"
29-04-2018T14:35:06,PhilTheIdle,But with keidran
29-04-2018T14:35:22,PhilTheIdle,Or maybe keidrans?
29-04-2018T14:35:37,PhilTheIdle,Whats the plural of keidran?
29-04-2018T14:35:55,TheFDdriver,...
29-04-2018T14:36:08,totallynotTrace,phil: there is an alternate timeline in wich zen and nat wash ashore on the basitin island and the king raises them
29-04-2018T14:36:47,PhilTheIdle,Didn't know that
29-04-2018T14:37:07,TheFDdriver,check patreon
29-04-2018T14:37:09,totallynotTrace,theres a few other sketches on patreon of it
29-04-2018T14:37:20,totallynotTrace,"darn, fd beat me to it"
29-04-2018T14:37:31,TheFDdriver,that was lucky
29-04-2018T14:37:38,ItsActuallyKopyKat,keidran is both singular and plural
29-04-2018T14:37:42,ItsActuallyKopyKat,like fish
29-04-2018T14:37:45,ItsActuallyKopyKat,and sheep
29-04-2018T14:38:05,Aero4651,Hmm
29-04-2018T14:39:01,TheFDdriver,beef?
29-04-2018T14:39:28,totallynotTrace,i think that might be steak XD
29-04-2018T14:39:40,totallynotTrace,jk
29-04-2018T14:39:58,totallynotTrace,it was funny in my head until i hit enter
29-04-2018T14:40:19,TheFDdriver,Haha
29-04-2018T14:40:30,Twokinds,The plural of Basitin is Basidippidopolis
29-04-2018T14:40:41,Dadrobit,"A group of keidran are actually referred to as a a ""murder"" like a flock of crows. It was set in a new mandate by the Templar a few years back. The fact that Trace was the head of the Templar at the time is completely unrelated."
29-04-2018T14:40:47,Soundbytee,Bwah...
29-04-2018T14:40:50,Bgrmystr2,xD
29-04-2018T14:41:18,TheFDdriver,Lol

29-04-2018T14:45:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Is Tom doing better than yesterday? 😶
29-04-2018T14:46:15,TheFDdriver,This is a Nora Card Kiwi
29-04-2018T14:46:25,Dadrobit,"I'd say yes, but I'm biased."
29-04-2018T14:46:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
29-04-2018T14:46:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean he said he’d been feeling foggy. Wasn’t commentary on the drawing
29-04-2018T14:47:14,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"""As long as it isn't Zen and Kat, it's better."" -Marv, probably"
29-04-2018T14:48:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Zen was dreaming about Raine's pillows last page, am happy"
29-04-2018T14:48:26,ItsActuallyKopyKat,mmhm lol
29-04-2018T14:48:26,TheFDdriver,true
29-04-2018T14:49:28,MrRetroRealm,Greetings
29-04-2018T14:49:37,TheFDdriver,hello Retro
29-04-2018T14:49:39,Soundbytee,Hiya
29-04-2018T14:49:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"And Raine also was checking up on him, so you know at least some one cares about my baby"
29-04-2018T14:49:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Santa’s not looking very jolly
29-04-2018T14:49:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Retro
29-04-2018T14:49:48,MrRetroRealm,"Sup, everyone?"
29-04-2018T14:49:59,PalmettoPathfinder1,Hi Retro
29-04-2018T14:50:08,Dadrobit,"Howdy, finishing up my pancakes, then heading back home."
29-04-2018T14:50:09,PhilTheIdle,Hi
29-04-2018T14:50:19,Whitestripes,"Hello, Retro"
29-04-2018T14:50:26,MrRetroRealm,What Tom be drawin?
29-04-2018T14:50:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nora card
29-04-2018T14:50:43,MrRetroRealm,Eh?
29-04-2018T14:50:56,TheFDdriver,What Marv said
29-04-2018T14:51:03,SpazztasticKiwi,“Santa Questions His Life Choices”
29-04-2018T14:51:03,MrRetroRealm,IDK what that is
29-04-2018T14:51:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,What FD said
29-04-2018T14:51:48,MrRetroRealm,"Never read Twokinds, just an FYI, so I know literally nothin"
29-04-2018T14:52:09,TheFDdriver,You know his patreon?
29-04-2018T14:52:12,MrRetroRealm,no
29-04-2018T14:52:12,Dadrobit,Nora Card is a premium sponsorship to get any previously sketched piece Tom has created done in full glossy coor.
29-04-2018T14:52:16,Dadrobit,color*
29-04-2018T14:52:23,Vatruvius,"Woah, surprise stream. What we doing here?"
29-04-2018T14:52:24,TheFDdriver,Thanks Dadro
29-04-2018T14:52:30,MrRetroRealm,Thanks for explaining
29-04-2018T14:52:31,totallynotTrace,ill paste this here
29-04-2018T14:52:37,Vatruvius,"I see, Nora Card"
29-04-2018T14:52:42,TheFDdriver,I couldn't explain it
29-04-2018T14:52:43,astertz,They are so cute
29-04-2018T14:52:47,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"...good catch, vatru"
29-04-2018T14:52:50,astertz,Little wolfies &lt;3
29-04-2018T14:52:50,totallynotTrace,"Feel like a sketch was unfairly overlooked? Have a favorite you want to see finished? Acquire a Nora Card to bend fate in your favor. Each month on this tier gives you one use, which can be spent to have ANY sketch from any previous month inked and colore"
29-04-2018T14:52:58,ItsActuallyKopyKat,ty trace
29-04-2018T14:53:37,totallynotTrace,although yeah dad pretty much summed it up
29-04-2018T14:53:38,MrRetroRealm,I don't like Patreon since many creators either use improperly or just plain abuse it's system to make more money even though what some create tend to not have much value due to several variables
29-04-2018T14:53:40,Vatruvius,Or you could have just looked up Tom's Patreon page and read it...
29-04-2018T14:53:53,TheFDdriver,thats a better idea
29-04-2018T14:54:08,totallynotTrace,true
29-04-2018T14:54:11,totallynotTrace,i got you
29-04-2018T14:54:14,totallynotTrace,https://www.patreon.com/twokinds
29-04-2018T14:54:33,Dadrobit,"Eh, value is in the eye of the wallet holder."
29-04-2018T14:54:35,totallynotTrace,also link is in the banner
29-04-2018T14:54:38,MrRetroRealm,One of my friends uses Patreon and to be honest I do not believe he is using it properly
29-04-2018T14:54:54,Dadrobit,"If people are willing to pay for it, it's worth at least that much."
29-04-2018T14:55:06,MrRetroRealm,"For one, he makes people have to pay for sketches that are not even worth the time"
29-04-2018T14:55:07,Whitestripes,i mean you get what you pay for
29-04-2018T14:55:22,TheFDdriver,side comics
29-04-2018T14:55:36,Whitestripes,"If they like the sketches and are willing to pay for them, that must mean they think they are worth it"
29-04-2018T14:55:46,MrRetroRealm,"What I found dumb was he posted an image there, people had to pay for it, days later he posted it on DA"
29-04-2018T14:55:46,Whitestripes,But what do I know
29-04-2018T14:56:10,MrRetroRealm,I guess I'm either picky or extremely patient
29-04-2018T14:56:11,MalinSharpPaw,But where is Alaric?
29-04-2018T14:56:20,Vatruvius,"It does not matter how one sets up their Patreon, though it would help bring in more support. It really is up to the donators."
29-04-2018T14:56:42,astertz,can you pleeaaase post that cover on patreon ? I really wanna set it as wallpaper!!
29-04-2018T14:57:01,totallynotTrace,"if you dont want to pay for it, dont pay for it."
29-04-2018T14:57:02,Vatruvius,Cover?
29-04-2018T14:57:08,Dadrobit,Book 4
29-04-2018T14:57:18,Vatruvius,Ohh.
29-04-2018T14:57:28,astertz,I purchased book 4 but i want that cover so bad!
29-04-2018T14:57:53,TheFDdriver,i got no money :(
29-04-2018T14:57:53,iliar,"@MrRetroRealm This is called ""early access"". And I do not see a problem if people are ready to pay for it."
29-04-2018T14:57:57,MrRetroRealm,I also have plans to make comics one day
29-04-2018T14:58:13,MrRetroRealm,I have no problems in waiting
29-04-2018T14:58:26,totallynotTrace,then dont pay if you chill with waiting
29-04-2018T14:58:34,MrRetroRealm,Exactly
29-04-2018T14:58:39,MrRetroRealm,I'm patient
29-04-2018T14:58:47,totallynotTrace,brb
29-04-2018T14:58:50,MrRetroRealm,Ight
29-04-2018T14:59:04,TheFDdriver,you have to pay to get the side comics? Right?
29-04-2018T14:59:15,PhilTheIdle,right
29-04-2018T14:59:33,Dadrobit,Be back in a bit.
29-04-2018T14:59:33,iliar,And in this case you receive content for free. And some people want to support the author and as a nice bonus receive content before.
29-04-2018T14:59:37,MrRetroRealm,"But anyways, I honestly have no problems with Patreon, just the people who don't use it properly. Maybe one day I will set up a Patreon when I feel my art has enough value to it"
29-04-2018T14:59:37,Vatruvius,"Donate, any amount will give you access. Or is it a minimum of $5?"
29-04-2018T15:00:01,PhilTheIdle,You need to pay at least 5$
29-04-2018T15:00:02,MrRetroRealm,Tom seems to be a guy who knows what they are doing
29-04-2018T15:00:16,MrRetroRealm,I can see the hard work he puts into
29-04-2018T15:00:21,MrRetroRealm,his art
29-04-2018T15:00:36,iliar,@PhilTheIdle Nope. One dollar is enough.
29-04-2018T15:00:51,TheFDdriver,i dont thinks so..
29-04-2018T15:00:58,MrRetroRealm,I just find it slightly annoying when people sell sketches that are not commissions
29-04-2018T15:00:59,Soundbytee,"Pff hehe, I didn't notice the pillow before"
29-04-2018T15:01:02,PhilTheIdle,@iliar But you don't get side comics for taht.
29-04-2018T15:01:05,PhilTheIdle,that
29-04-2018T15:01:30,MrRetroRealm,To me sketches only have value if you are paid to make it
29-04-2018T15:01:48,MrRetroRealm,But that's my opinion
29-04-2018T15:02:02,iliar,As I created a second account and tested it. Even if you pay $ 1 a month this is enough to get access to the side comic.
29-04-2018T15:02:18,KatsukiYoshida,SANTA
29-04-2018T15:02:21,MrRetroRealm,Sorry if I upsetted anyone
29-04-2018T15:02:24,PhilTheIdle,I tried and it didn't work
29-04-2018T15:02:46,MrRetroRealm,"I sometimes zone out when texting a lot, dunno why"
29-04-2018T15:03:08,MrRetroRealm,"Anyways, any Sonic/Star Fox fans here?"
29-04-2018T15:03:30,iliar,@PhilTheIdle Hm... Wait a minute. I test again.
29-04-2018T15:03:39,Vatruvius,"I rather like Tom's sketches, I also like that mostly everything is free to view. That made me want to support Tom because I like hus work and want to keep it going."
29-04-2018T15:03:48,astertz,"I love those white ""markings"" in the kings hair"
29-04-2018T15:04:03,MrRetroRealm,Tom sounds smart when using Patreon
29-04-2018T15:04:18,Vatruvius,That is suppose to show her age astertz
29-04-2018T15:04:23,MrRetroRealm,"My friend, I kid you not, over 90% of what he posts has to be paid for"
29-04-2018T15:04:31,totallynotTrace,I is back
29-04-2018T15:04:49,PhilTheIdle,Hurray!
29-04-2018T15:04:57,MrRetroRealm,Only things that were never paid for were ads to art packs he was making
29-04-2018T15:05:11,MrRetroRealm,But now he can't do that as much anymore
29-04-2018T15:05:29,Vatruvius,Everyone is entitled to do with their work as they want.
29-04-2018T15:05:37,MrRetroRealm,True
29-04-2018T15:05:41,Aero4651,Ture
29-04-2018T15:06:01,MrRetroRealm,I'm just a guy that likes to think more outside the box and apply more logic to such situations
29-04-2018T15:06:13,MrRetroRealm,Not too outside the box
29-04-2018T15:06:27,MrRetroRealm,Just enough to put together a system that works for me
29-04-2018T15:06:40,TheFDdriver,i go way too outside
29-04-2018T15:06:50,MrRetroRealm,"On second thought, I'm very close minded sooooooo I think I stick inside the box"
29-04-2018T15:08:04,Vatruvius,Would a sketch suggestion about Maren and Trace pre-comic be a spoiler @Twokinds or can I suggest it?
29-04-2018T15:08:12,totallynotTrace,"like tom charging $200 a month for the Nora card. It sounds like a rip off, but its not for the people that want to have the limited ability to vote (theres only 4 slots open in patreon for this) so i think he should continue with it if theres people"
29-04-2018T15:08:19,totallynotTrace,willng to pay
29-04-2018T15:08:37,MrRetroRealm,$200?!
29-04-2018T15:08:45,totallynotTrace,yah
29-04-2018T15:08:58,totallynotTrace,but in my opinion thats fine
29-04-2018T15:09:04,TheFDdriver,yes is not that bad when you think about it
29-04-2018T15:09:10,InTheLionsDen,For the time he spend on doing them it is a fair wage.
29-04-2018T15:09:13,Vatruvius,For the most stonch supporters.
29-04-2018T15:09:35,MrRetroRealm,Hmmm
29-04-2018T15:09:42,totallynotTrace,I agree with Lion
29-04-2018T15:10:01,MrRetroRealm,"Yeah, seems right, this art is some of the best I've seen"
29-04-2018T15:10:28,ItsActuallyKopyKat,That santa's helper is almost as tall as Adelaide!
29-04-2018T15:10:39,Zakuru,....sweet jesus
29-04-2018T15:10:42,Zakuru,what is this music XDD

29-04-2018T15:57:52,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Wait...does that mean that Maddy is technically an adult then? Since she follows their decency laws?
29-04-2018T15:58:43,Zakuru,maybe she does since she's a knight or whatever
29-04-2018T15:58:55,Zakuru,important role = decency
29-04-2018T15:58:56,ItsActuallyKopyKat,*lieutenant* &gt;.&gt;

29-04-2018T15:59:58,TheVileOne,not requiring footwraps for children while it is indecent for adults is asking for trouble
29-04-2018T16:00:47,TheFDdriver,nah
29-04-2018T16:01:03,TheFDdriver,the adults know its ok
29-04-2018T16:01:21,TheVileOne,this society would have an issue with pedophilia
29-04-2018T16:01:38,qwe304,i wonter what non-mentally-scarred natani would be like...

29-04-2018T16:08:35,TheVileOne,@ItsActuallyKopyKat need a better description than that... as thats a shallow argument that can explain away nearly anything.. Vulcans went to great lengths to repress emotions and that's their excuse... I suppose a similar cultural difference affects

29-04-2018T17:20:44,Vatruvius,That is why I like the sappy scenes.
29-04-2018T17:21:11,Vatruvius,Don't think that is how it works zan

29-04-2018T17:26:10,Vatruvius,I don't think this was answered before...would a sketch suggestion about Maren and Trace pre-comic be a spoiler @Twokinds?
29-04-2018T17:26:25,BadFoMo,@TheFDdriver It was PM.
29-04-2018T17:26:36,HeresyArtStream,"As they say in the Basitin Isles, ""Once you go West, you know they're the best."""

29-04-2018T17:27:44,MviluUatusun,Hello everybody.
29-04-2018T17:27:57,Vatruvius,Hello Mvilu!

29-04-2018T17:32:06,totallynotTrace,"""person"" is a broad term, yes. there are ""non human persons"" but its in a dictionary"
29-04-2018T17:32:16,totallynotTrace,sapiosexual is not
29-04-2018T17:32:26,totallynotTrace,or at least not the english dictionary
29-04-2018T17:32:57,totallynotTrace,it is on xvideos tho
29-04-2018T17:33:17,totallynotTrace,urban dictionary doesnt classify as a dictionary
29-04-2018T17:33:17,zanAspera,Zere are many dictionaries.  English is blessed not to have a lanuage academy that says how English may and mayn't be used.
29-04-2018T17:33:19,Vatruvius,That is enough of that.
29-04-2018T17:33:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Whoa there. No xvideos here
29-04-2018T17:33:58,Vatruvius,Let's stay at 18- content here.

29-04-2018T17:34:34,HeresyArtStream,Urban Dictionary is a less credible source than TVtropes. :p

29-04-2018T17:36:37,totallynotTrace,zan is calling a 21 year old a kid :/
29-04-2018T17:36:56,zanAspera,"Any seerious lexographer will tell you their dictionary is descriptivist.  If you want to use a dictionary in a proscriptivist way, you are wrong.  Grammar books maybe..."

29-04-2018T17:37:03,TheFDdriver,he means mentally

29-04-2018T17:41:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Not hard to be older than Tom. It’s just most of his stuff appeals to younger people
29-04-2018T17:42:20,totallynotTrace,now i get it your lisp. your significantly furrier than I am
