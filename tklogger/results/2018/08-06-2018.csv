08-06-2018T00:01:05,Trevuxnouxe,that was a bag in her hand.....:ptv-confused:
08-06-2018T00:01:07,SageSaga,this list says otherwise
08-06-2018T00:01:10,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Same here!
08-06-2018T00:01:11,SpazztasticKiwi,At least not now
08-06-2018T00:01:11,Dadrobit,Does one refer to their family members with things other than obscenities?
08-06-2018T00:01:22,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"kiwi, did we just become bffs?"

08-06-2018T00:01:49,SageSaga,you gave Akame ga Kill a 4.5
08-06-2018T00:01:50,ItsActuallyKopyKat,sweet
08-06-2018T00:02:04,Zakuru,i know it betrayed the manga pretty badly
08-06-2018T00:02:18,CrRAR,I hope the list is curated and reordered accordingly and often
08-06-2018T00:02:24,Dadrobit,"Hm, people rate things with scores that aren't either perfect or nothing?"
08-06-2018T00:02:26,Trevuxnouxe,anyone know any furry animes?
08-06-2018T00:02:33,Zakuru,killing bites

08-06-2018T00:02:43,SageSaga,out of 5
08-06-2018T00:02:57,ZRO4825,"I wanted to like Akame Ga Kill so much more, but it made me so blasted angry/sad ;_;"
08-06-2018T00:02:59,Zakuru,jesus you must love that anime XD

08-06-2018T00:04:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Load you stupid stream :ctwokinds-sleepoverB:
08-06-2018T00:04:24,ZRO4825,Every time I try I turn it back on to Subaru yelling and crap and he aggravates me on like...some sort of spiritual level.
08-06-2018T00:04:30,Zakuru,^^^^]
08-06-2018T00:04:34,Zakuru,you have to pull through
08-06-2018T00:04:36,Zakuru,you just gotta

08-06-2018T00:04:52,unsteddyphoenix,"I really liked it, and not just because of rem!"
08-06-2018T00:04:54,ZRO4825,And then Subaru opens his mouth. :V
08-06-2018T00:04:57,Zakuru,i hate subaru with a passion but you gotta tolerate
08-06-2018T00:04:58,SageSaga,He's supposed to Subaru is trash- the story is about how he becomes less trash
08-06-2018T00:05:04,Trevuxnouxe,killing bits is too much for me and the one dadro mention isnt furries...
08-06-2018T00:05:04,Lucarionation,Re:Zero was alright.
08-06-2018T00:05:11,Trevuxnouxe,bites?

08-06-2018T00:05:13,Trevuxnouxe,*
08-06-2018T00:05:15,w0lfmare,"It was good, they pulled off the messed up-ness of it in a way that you wanted to keep watching to see everything get fixed"
08-06-2018T00:05:17,Dadrobit,"Real talk tho, I think Grimoire of Zero is about furries?"
08-06-2018T00:05:21,Zakuru,"sage, i still see him as trash"
08-06-2018T00:05:32,Zakuru,"dad, it has beastmen in it"
08-06-2018T00:05:32,SageSaga,i didnt say he becomes not trash XD
08-06-2018T00:05:38,Zakuru,its not all about furs though
08-06-2018T00:05:38,Dadrobit,iliar was talking about it last time.
08-06-2018T00:05:40,ZRO4825,"I know, I know. It's just...he aggravates me THAT much. Like he makes me want to actually punch my monitor."
08-06-2018T00:05:47,unsteddyphoenix,It's slow going
08-06-2018T00:05:49,ZRO4825,And I'm rather fond of my monitor.
08-06-2018T00:05:53,unsteddyphoenix,to become not trash

08-06-2018T00:06:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve seen anime’s like that - characters that are such dickweeds you want yo commit murder
08-06-2018T00:06:54,SageSaga,why did Izetta get a 4 Zakuru?
08-06-2018T00:07:06,SpazztasticKiwi,*animes **to

08-06-2018T00:07:11,unsteddyphoenix,Characters that you hate that much are good characters
08-06-2018T00:07:15,Katfeathers,may the fluffception be with you
08-06-2018T00:07:15,unsteddyphoenix,Unless you hate them because youre bad
08-06-2018T00:07:15,Zakuru,i thought it was good
08-06-2018T00:07:25,SageSaga,but it copped out at the end-
08-06-2018T00:07:33,Zakuru,true
08-06-2018T00:07:41,Zakuru,but sometimes the ending doesn't ruin the whole show for me
08-06-2018T00:07:46,Zakuru,like erased
08-06-2018T00:08:01,Bgrmystr2,I wanna know how Kanokon got a 4 but Chobits got a 3
08-06-2018T00:08:03,SageSaga,Erased didnt have a cop out ending though
08-06-2018T00:08:04,ZRO4825,FFXIII-2's ending killed that game for me. &gt;:(
08-06-2018T00:08:06,Trevuxnouxe,"does anyone know of any other furry web comics other than TK or SD, that are a least 16+?"

08-06-2018T00:08:42,Zakuru,"i think in that regard bgr, it was more of an impression"
08-06-2018T00:08:42,Dadrobit,"Sooooo, you're basically asking for furry porn Trev?"
08-06-2018T00:08:43,SageSaga,you gave Oreimo a 4 but you gave it's far SUPERIOR verson a 2.5
08-06-2018T00:09:01,Trevuxnouxe,14+ no
08-06-2018T00:09:02,Bgrmystr2,"but I guess I'm more familiar with the manga for chobits.. so I mean, may not be a fair comparison compared to yours"

08-06-2018T00:10:33,SageSaga,Luna is stronger and has a lot less openings
08-06-2018T00:10:40,Zakuru,"bgr, my ratings are kinda on first impressions. hence why SAO still has a high rating even though I utterly hate it now"
08-06-2018T00:10:42,Ordithus,"Also, comic, woot"

08-06-2018T00:12:42,Dadrobit,o/ Grish

08-06-2018T00:12:57,Zakuru,....*sao
08-06-2018T00:13:01,Dadrobit,"Correct, hipsters often have no taste."
08-06-2018T00:13:06,Zakuru,boy XD
08-06-2018T00:13:08,ZRO4825,"Coulda fooled me, all I ever see 'bout it is bitching, lol."
08-06-2018T00:13:09,Dadrobit,:)
08-06-2018T00:13:15,SageSaga,the hate for SAO is real - and for a good reason
08-06-2018T00:13:17,Zakuru,your on the internet
08-06-2018T00:13:25,Zakuru,other opinions are available
08-06-2018T00:13:38,SageSaga,i would defend it if it deserved consideration
08-06-2018T00:13:56,Dadrobit,"Damn, that's savage"
08-06-2018T00:14:07,unsteddyphoenix,Harsh but fair
08-06-2018T00:14:08,SageSaga,i will also say though- In anime- it is ok to like Trash
08-06-2018T00:14:12,w0lfmare,I used to hear how amazing SAO was. Rep took a sharp 180
08-06-2018T00:14:17,LEgGOdt1,SAO is rather good in my view
08-06-2018T00:14:30,unsteddyphoenix,Theres cute girls doing stuff trash and then theres trash trash
08-06-2018T00:14:33,Zakuru,what about if you seperate it into arcs?
08-06-2018T00:14:38,Trevuxnouxe,is lovs coics pegs
08-06-2018T00:14:39,Dadrobit,"Yeah, never watched it, but I remember hearing a lot of hype when it came out."
08-06-2018T00:14:45,Trevuxnouxe,cocaine
08-06-2018T00:14:54,ZRO4825,Oh now if we're gonna go by Arcs? Then ho yeah pieces of SAO are CRAP XD
08-06-2018T00:14:54,Dadrobit,Got some love from abridged series too.
08-06-2018T00:15:06,unsteddyphoenix,THe first few episodes made it look like it was gonna be good
08-06-2018T00:15:11,unsteddyphoenix,THen...the rest happened.
08-06-2018T00:15:24,Zakuru,XD
08-06-2018T00:15:25,SageSaga,SAO looks good- but if you look at it from a game perspective it is awful- and if you look at it from a story perspective- it's bad- and if you look at it from a point of it's villains- it's garbage
08-06-2018T00:15:25,unsteddyphoenix,The abridged series is the best abrisged ever though
08-06-2018T00:15:28,Dadrobit,The failure of the 3 episode rule?
08-06-2018T00:15:35,unsteddyphoenix,Pretty much daddy
08-06-2018T00:15:36,Zakuru,yes?
08-06-2018T00:15:45,FenceEqualizer,SAO abridged is pretty good
08-06-2018T00:15:51,Zakuru,i never really rewatch animes so its a bit foggy
08-06-2018T00:15:59,SageSaga,SAO abridged is brilliant
08-06-2018T00:16:04,unsteddyphoenix,Its SO FUNNY
08-06-2018T00:16:07,SageSaga,it fixes most of the issues with SAO
08-06-2018T00:16:10,LEgGOdt1,Gundam Seed
08-06-2018T00:16:15,SageSaga,and makes the story better
08-06-2018T00:16:24,SageSaga,and fixes the characters
08-06-2018T00:16:37,SageSaga,it is an abridged series that legit improves the original
08-06-2018T00:16:39,Dadrobit,"Don't remember where I was in the abridged for SAO, it's been a long time since I looked at it."
08-06-2018T00:16:46,FenceEqualizer,Hope season 2 picks up
08-06-2018T00:16:52,unsteddyphoenix,I actually felt for the abridged characters
08-06-2018T00:16:57,SageSaga,DBZ abridged is great- but it doesnt make a BETTER DBZ
08-06-2018T00:17:05,FenceEqualizer,They finished the first season Robit and did one episode of season 2
08-06-2018T00:17:07,Bgrmystr2,"wait, zro a hipster? I dunno about that one. They like stuff /because/ other ppl hate it. Not because they themselves actually like it"
08-06-2018T00:17:09,Trevuxnouxe,my friend likes sword art online.....i ithinks its stupid......
08-06-2018T00:17:10,unsteddyphoenix,"Agreed 100%, SAO abridged is strictly better"
08-06-2018T00:17:12,caudamus,SAO abridged does a bunch of things to make the series more awesome.
08-06-2018T00:17:15,Ordithus,I just want more One Punch
08-06-2018T00:17:18,Zakuru,^
08-06-2018T00:17:25,Zakuru,"ordithus, a 2nd season is confirmed"

08-06-2018T00:18:03,ZRO4825,"Nice, Dadro! =D"
08-06-2018T00:18:10,Zakuru,"@fence, its a different studio"
08-06-2018T00:18:11,LEgGOdt1,Hi
08-06-2018T00:18:19,FenceEqualizer,Noooooooo!
08-06-2018T00:18:37,SageSaga,also the writer for SAO was basically stealing the story of SAO but added a harem
08-06-2018T00:18:42,Zakuru,i think its production I.G but i can't remember
08-06-2018T00:18:47,unsteddyphoenix,the harem is the worst biiit
08-06-2018T00:18:47,Dadrobit,They ended up putting on an impromptu panel outside of the event after some dickwad set off the fire alarm at the convention.
08-06-2018T00:18:54,SageSaga,"then arc 2 he was like ""Crap- gotta do my own thing"""
08-06-2018T00:19:11,Bgrmystr2,It wasn't even a harem though
08-06-2018T00:19:14,LEgGOdt1,Now Gundam Seed had the problem with some of the characters but I'm a Gundam and mecha fan since TOONAMI first aired in 98
08-06-2018T00:19:16,Dadrobit,KEEF?
08-06-2018T00:19:18,Bgrmystr2,or barely worthy of being called one
08-06-2018T00:19:19,ZRO4825,"Yeah, I gotta admit the harem angle on SAO annoys me &gt;:("
08-06-2018T00:19:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD

08-06-2018T00:19:40,Zakuru,i dislike harems
08-06-2018T00:19:43,unsteddyphoenix,literally like 5 episodes are dedicated to the harem
08-06-2018T00:19:47,unsteddyphoenix,out of 12
08-06-2018T00:19:51,Dadrobit,I literally only remember one episode from Seed.
08-06-2018T00:19:52,Zakuru,unless they are reversed because im biased like that lol
08-06-2018T00:19:54,Katfeathers,didn't realy seem haremy to me
08-06-2018T00:19:55,Keeeef,What is a harem
08-06-2018T00:19:57,Dadrobit,War for Two.
08-06-2018T00:20:07,LEgGOdt1,@ZRO4825 then try watching Tenchi Muyo Ryo-Ohki!
08-06-2018T00:20:09,Ordithus,Rose is concerned
08-06-2018T00:20:09,FenceEqualizer,Bucket head Trace?
08-06-2018T00:20:33,SageSaga,"""Does she like Kirito?"" ""Everyone likes Kirito"" ""Even Klein likes Kirito"""
08-06-2018T00:20:43,Ordithus,lol
08-06-2018T00:20:47,Dadrobit,Can't ever finish Tenchi Muyo knowing that the relationships are never canonically resolved.
08-06-2018T00:21:04,Keeeef,What you guys talking about
08-06-2018T00:21:07,Trevuxnouxe,shit

08-06-2018T00:22:03,Bgrmystr2,you mad they can have more than one?
08-06-2018T00:22:03,Katfeathers,"yes Kirito made lots of friends, but not masses of ""want him"""

08-06-2018T00:29:00,FenceEqualizer,What is this fan fiction I am reading?!
08-06-2018T00:29:31,unsteddyphoenix,Ohh that guy
08-06-2018T00:29:33,ZRO4825,I read Sage's fanfiction every week. Two different stories of it!
08-06-2018T00:29:37,SageSaga,and im not even charging for this service
08-06-2018T00:29:37,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah im all about that ship
08-06-2018T00:29:53,unsteddyphoenix,100% in its brolove
08-06-2018T00:29:57,Zakuru,do any of us feel even the slightest bit cringey that these are underaged kids doing all this stuff?
08-06-2018T00:30:15,FenceEqualizer,You stop tainting my bromance with your lies
08-06-2018T00:30:33,SageSaga,writing this stuff or being the characters we are talking about?
08-06-2018T00:30:43,Zakuru,sao
08-06-2018T00:30:59,ZRO4825,"Um...they're pretty much the same age as just about every other anime hero/heroine, soo...kinda got over that years ago, lol"
08-06-2018T00:31:07,SageSaga,because im pretty sure as soon as they enter a fan fiction it takes place X years later where x is the current year plus a number of years till they are 18
08-06-2018T00:31:08,FenceEqualizer,Honestly not really
08-06-2018T00:31:20,SageSaga,i did that math wrong
08-06-2018T00:31:24,SageSaga,everyone is dead now
08-06-2018T00:31:25,FenceEqualizer,It's the nature of Japanime
08-06-2018T00:31:50,Bgrmystr2,rip sage
08-06-2018T00:31:54,Bgrmystr2,math is difficult
08-06-2018T00:31:58,ZRO4825,"Actually, it's Japan. Gotta remember, Japan's legal limit for stuff is 14 (Unless they finally changed it within the last few years)"

08-06-2018T00:32:03,Bgrmystr2,it wrongs even when you try to do it  right
08-06-2018T00:32:05,SageSaga,i just typed too fast
08-06-2018T00:32:14,Zakuru,i could've sworn it was 18
08-06-2018T00:32:20,Bgrmystr2,not everywhere zak
08-06-2018T00:32:33,Zakuru,wow just looked it up
08-06-2018T00:32:36,Zakuru,:upside_down:
08-06-2018T00:32:39,RimaDraws,lol
08-06-2018T00:32:43,SageSaga,should be year X where x equals the current year plus the years it takes for them to be 18
08-06-2018T00:32:48,Zakuru,japan get out of the stone ages
08-06-2018T00:33:03,Bgrmystr2,I think Japan may be one of the few NOT in the stone ages
08-06-2018T00:33:05,unsteddyphoenix,pretty sure its not 14 anymore
08-06-2018T00:33:06,Bgrmystr2,being so prudish
08-06-2018T00:33:12,unsteddyphoenix,Or maybe in a select few places
08-06-2018T00:33:17,Bgrmystr2,though they have problems too
08-06-2018T00:33:21,FenceEqualizer,Hello ticking time bomb
08-06-2018T00:33:25,Katfeathers,tis the acnoladgement that thy (and the origional target audeance) are olde enough to get ideas
08-06-2018T00:33:38,Zakuru,they are prudy on the outside and pervs on the inside
08-06-2018T00:33:39,Katfeathers,*they
08-06-2018T00:33:50,SageSaga,"like you are watching an anime and theres a girl that looks 12 and shes like ""Teehee! im 18!"" and you are like ""THIS IS GOING TO A BAD PLACE"""
08-06-2018T00:34:08,ZRO4825,"Let's face it. the US's legal age limit ain't stoppin nothin from happening anyway. Japan's just more honest. That's the way I see it at least, lol."
08-06-2018T00:34:30,ZRO4825,"I think I'm more bothered by the girls in anime that got a rack that belongs on a 20-year old swimsuit model and they're like ""I'm 13!"" @.@"
08-06-2018T00:34:42,Bgrmystr2,lool
08-06-2018T00:34:46,unsteddyphoenix,Honestly theres enough anime that just makes them straight up 12
08-06-2018T00:34:47,Katfeathers,teenagers still date other teenagers irl ya?
08-06-2018T00:34:55,ZRO4825,Indeed.
08-06-2018T00:34:55,unsteddyphoenix,If theyre 18 at least the author has SOME shame
08-06-2018T00:35:14,ZRO4825,Or knows he's gonna deal with americans. :P
08-06-2018T00:35:15,Zakuru,this is why i love horo x lawernce instead of all those other ships lol
08-06-2018T00:35:15,Bgrmystr2,"Zro, that's just cuz they're unhappy with themselves"
08-06-2018T00:35:26,Bgrmystr2,since that's not the norm in the country
08-06-2018T00:35:36,FenceEqualizer,"What is this shame you speak of"" - Anime artist...probably"
08-06-2018T00:35:53,Bgrmystr2,tis a reason T&A is a huge genre in anime and manga. It's cuz it's nigh fantasy to actually find it in the country
08-06-2018T00:35:58,SageSaga,"""We're all in middle school now! Yay! We're all 18 too!"" ""We are all SOOOO DUMB!"""
08-06-2018T00:36:00,Bgrmystr2,farrrrr and few between
08-06-2018T00:36:27,Bgrmystr2,it's compensation of sorts.
08-06-2018T00:36:29,FenceEqualizer,Sounds like a job for Keijo
08-06-2018T00:36:34,Bgrmystr2,"prettymuch, fence"
08-06-2018T00:36:56,ZRO4825,Keijo was so much fuckin fun to watch XD
08-06-2018T00:37:04,Bgrmystr2,didn't watch it yet
08-06-2018T00:37:20,FenceEqualizer,Trash anime at it's finest
08-06-2018T00:37:25,ZRO4825,"It's all 'bout the T&A and isn't ashamed of it at all, lol"
08-06-2018T00:37:44,Bgrmystr2,"at that point, I dunno how ""trash"" it is if that's the entire point OF the series"
08-06-2018T00:37:49,ZRO4825,Keijo was entertaining. Call that whatever ya want I guess.
08-06-2018T00:37:51,Bgrmystr2,I'd consider it a complete success.
08-06-2018T00:38:06,Dadrobit,Alright. Place your bets. Do I get at least 15 minutes before I have to go settle some shit? Or are they gonna be down for the night?
08-06-2018T00:38:18,Katfeathers,heh
08-06-2018T00:38:23,ZRO4825,"It's literally about a made-up sport where women try to knock each other into the water using nothing but their Tits & Ass. LITERALLY the whole point of it, lol."

08-06-2018T00:39:10,FenceEqualizer,Too cheesy for ya Sage?
08-06-2018T00:39:16,unsteddyphoenix,Seems impossible with the art style
08-06-2018T00:39:28,Bgrmystr2,"by making them male, phoenix"
08-06-2018T00:39:30,FenceEqualizer,By giving them massive boobs apparently Unsteddy

08-06-2018T00:40:22,Bgrmystr2,of course dadro. there's a difference between anime and reality
08-06-2018T00:40:25,RimaDraws,and yea messed up to think that
08-06-2018T00:40:27,ZRO4825,"Problem with anime is, they CLAIM a character is like 14...and draw them like they're 19."
08-06-2018T00:40:34,Bgrmystr2,just cuz some ppl can't see the difference doesn't mean it ain't there
08-06-2018T00:40:46,SageSaga,Tom you there?
08-06-2018T00:40:46,unsteddyphoenix,idk hestia sama still looked pretty young despite being stacked
08-06-2018T00:40:57,unsteddyphoenix,and she was 10000000 years old god
08-06-2018T00:41:02,Dadrobit,Problem is when they claim they're 19 and draw them like they're 14.
08-06-2018T00:41:02,ZRO4825,Hestia gets called a booby loli in her own damned show. :joy:
08-06-2018T00:41:14,Bgrmystr2,"see, that's just art, dadro"
08-06-2018T00:41:19,Bgrmystr2,ppl gonna art
08-06-2018T00:41:26,ZRO4825,"No, valid characters drawn like that, Bgr."
08-06-2018T00:41:30,FenceEqualizer,Anime is weird
08-06-2018T00:41:36,unsteddyphoenix,"s'what im saying. If they just want a short character, they cant do it"
08-06-2018T00:41:42,unsteddyphoenix,they just become lolis
08-06-2018T00:41:57,Dadrobit,Chibis otherwise.
08-06-2018T00:42:04,ZRO4825,"Onegai Teacher had a character like that. She was technically older than the rest of the main cast, but was all not-grown-up due to a health issue."
08-06-2018T00:42:07,unsteddyphoenix,ech chibis
08-06-2018T00:42:07,FenceEqualizer,There's a way I am sure
08-06-2018T00:42:15,unsteddyphoenix,oh zro thats so gross lmao
08-06-2018T00:42:35,FenceEqualizer,It's all in the mannerisms
08-06-2018T00:42:44,Bgrmystr2,"lol phoenix, rude"
08-06-2018T00:42:48,ZRO4825,"I mean, you can call it what ya want, but if it's what someone wants to do... lol"
08-06-2018T00:43:00,Dadrobit,"And then there's Rose. Age 20-something, looking like menopause was a distant memory."
08-06-2018T00:43:12,FenceEqualizer,The problem is most of those characters act like a mid schooler
08-06-2018T00:43:19,ZRO4825,"Elins in TERA are a perfect example. People complain that they're lolis, and they're right...if they only look at the top half of the character."
08-06-2018T00:43:22,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"ok, but keidran age fast, remember"
08-06-2018T00:43:47,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-rose:
08-06-2018T00:43:58,SageSaga,so question for you all
08-06-2018T00:44:02,ZRO4825,"Once you look from the belly down on an Elin, ain't no way in hell that's a loli body type. Hips for DAYS. :rofl:"
08-06-2018T00:44:02,Katfeathers,like oposit of elf years

08-06-2018T00:44:33,SageSaga,would y'all be interested in a story written and illustrated like a light novel by Tom and I?
08-06-2018T00:44:39,RimaDraws,definitely
08-06-2018T00:44:41,MagicEnchilladas,yes
08-06-2018T00:44:45,Katfeathers,aye!
08-06-2018T00:44:48,Dadrobit,"That's a big old pile of ""depends""."
08-06-2018T00:44:48,Bgrmystr2,hmmmmm light novel
08-06-2018T00:44:52,Ordithus,Likely
08-06-2018T00:44:52,ZRO4825,Do I need to throw more money at your patreon to make it happen?
08-06-2018T00:44:57,unsteddyphoenix,I'd defintely be interested
08-06-2018T00:45:04,TheBeckoner,sounds neat

08-06-2018T00:45:12,FenceEqualizer,"Hmm, I'd have to know the story first. It am interested"
08-06-2018T00:45:12,Bgrmystr2,"sounds good, I'm not super big on light novels though"
08-06-2018T00:45:29,SageSaga,"cool, we're working on something- we'll give more info when we're ready"
08-06-2018T00:45:31,Dadrobit,I already got so much media on my table already though....
08-06-2018T00:45:34,ItsActuallyKopyKat,holy cow
08-06-2018T00:45:40,ItsActuallyKopyKat,heck yeah sage
08-06-2018T00:45:46,Ordithus,Neat-o
08-06-2018T00:45:48,SageSaga,i hope it happens cuz im excited
08-06-2018T00:45:59,Katfeathers,cool
08-06-2018T00:46:10,unsteddyphoenix,Nice!
08-06-2018T00:46:42,FenceEqualizer,"Soooo,can we get a teaser? My curiosity has been peeked"
08-06-2018T00:46:44,ItsActuallyKopyKat,so are we
08-06-2018T00:46:46,Bgrmystr2,"totally new characters, sage?"
08-06-2018T00:46:51,ItsActuallyKopyKat,*piqued
08-06-2018T00:46:56,SageSaga,yep new characters
08-06-2018T00:46:59,Bgrmystr2,okay
08-06-2018T00:47:07,unsteddyphoenix,New universe? Or twokinds?
08-06-2018T00:47:15,unsteddyphoenix,Or AI
08-06-2018T00:47:23,Bgrmystr2,cuz I was hoping tom wasn't gonna scrap the Sam and Colin comic for the LN
08-06-2018T00:47:35,Bgrmystr2,cuz I prefer the comic format myself
08-06-2018T00:47:35,FenceEqualizer,"Has it always been piqued? Huh, finally learned that phrase"
08-06-2018T00:47:39,ItsActuallyKopyKat,lol
08-06-2018T00:47:42,ItsActuallyKopyKat,all good dude
08-06-2018T00:47:50,Dadrobit,":/ I'm hopeful, but hesitant. Don't all y'all already have a ton of work on your mainstays and backburners?"
08-06-2018T00:47:59,SageSaga,with both of us working on it you can probably assume any other stories and projects wont be put on hold for it
08-06-2018T00:48:08,Dadrobit,"I'm all for branching out, but I don't want to see you both burning out ya know?"
08-06-2018T00:48:19,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, you both seem completely swamped sage"
08-06-2018T00:48:23,RimaDraws,been there on burning out
08-06-2018T00:48:38,SageSaga,you underestimate my power
08-06-2018T00:48:47,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-clovischuckle:
08-06-2018T00:48:55,MagicEnchilladas,just make sure you have the high ground Sage
08-06-2018T00:49:01,FenceEqualizer,I mean if they treat it like a side project in their spare time they should be fine.
08-06-2018T00:49:17,Dadrobit,"Don't get me wrong, I love both y'all. But there's only so much you guys can do on a regular schedule without carpel tunnel kicking your asses."
08-06-2018T00:49:37,Dadrobit,Just looking out for that &lt;#
08-06-2018T00:49:37,SageSaga,i dont suffer from Carpel Tunnel
08-06-2018T00:49:39,unsteddyphoenix,I assume it would be a casual project
08-06-2018T00:49:39,Dadrobit,&lt;3
08-06-2018T00:49:49,unsteddyphoenix,Working on it when they have time if they feel like it
08-06-2018T00:49:53,SageSaga,Tom does but i dont
08-06-2018T00:50:03,RimaDraws,no but it can be made while arting sometimes
08-06-2018T00:50:03,FenceEqualizer,what Unsteddy said
08-06-2018T00:50:05,RimaDraws,i have it
08-06-2018T00:50:17,RimaDraws,but mines not from art its from work
08-06-2018T00:50:26,w0lfmare,How can we expect to acquire said story once it's ready?
08-06-2018T00:50:30,FenceEqualizer,Got to keep those hands on working order
08-06-2018T00:50:32,Ordithus,With money
08-06-2018T00:50:43,CrimsonHelsing,"I'd think answering that question would be spoilers unsteddy, about which universe it's set in, be it TK, AI, or something new"
08-06-2018T00:50:47,MagicEnchilladas,"amazon, i believe they self publish"
08-06-2018T00:50:49,Dadrobit,InB4 ComicCon exclusive

08-06-2018T00:53:03,KaiserZephan,Ok time to lurk now as i will not get bell numbers on the page title

08-06-2018T01:34:40,unsteddyphoenix,"Woah, theres TWEWY news????"
08-06-2018T01:34:45,FenceEqualizer,"I know, just we havn't got any good news since 2015"
08-06-2018T01:34:51,unsteddyphoenix,Now THATS hype
08-06-2018T01:34:55,SageSaga,the FF7 Remake thing had to be scrapped - like almost all of it they had made so far
08-06-2018T01:34:56,FenceEqualizer,Wait...no way!
08-06-2018T01:35:11,FenceEqualizer,Twewy news would be hyped as all hell.
08-06-2018T01:35:12,MagicEnchilladas,"i heard something about the switch, my source is questionable at best, thirdhand news"
08-06-2018T01:35:25,unsteddyphoenix,I will try keep my hopes low
08-06-2018T01:35:44,FenceEqualizer,I'm still crying for that cause the gameplay trailer they showed looked so good
08-06-2018T01:35:44,TheBeckoner,Hmm Im gettin off too. Gotta wake up and paint some stuff before it gets too hot. Night y'all.
08-06-2018T01:35:53,FenceEqualizer,So worried it's going to be FF15 again
08-06-2018T01:35:55,unsteddyphoenix,That gameplay trailer was a looong time ago
08-06-2018T01:35:59,unsteddyphoenix,gnight
08-06-2018T01:36:13,FenceEqualizer,night Beck
08-06-2018T01:36:22,MagicEnchilladas,night unsteddy
08-06-2018T01:36:37,unsteddyphoenix,"close, the other guy"
08-06-2018T01:37:07,MagicEnchilladas,whoops
08-06-2018T01:38:44,FenceEqualizer,Also I know unsteddy just argh hope it doesn't end up in development hell.
08-06-2018T01:39:05,FenceEqualizer,Oh well at least KH3 looks like it'll be amazing.
08-06-2018T01:39:18,unsteddyphoenix,It'd be cool if it did come out.
08-06-2018T01:39:28,unsteddyphoenix,defintely would get it
08-06-2018T01:39:33,MagicEnchilladas,"i hope they keep the mechanic from dream drop, it was fun"
08-06-2018T01:40:00,FenceEqualizer,The freerun system?
08-06-2018T01:40:06,SageSaga,KH3 is 10 years too late
08-06-2018T01:40:08,FenceEqualizer,Looks like they toned it down.
08-06-2018T01:40:21,MagicEnchilladas,i believe that was what it was called
08-06-2018T01:40:44,SageSaga,i dont know what happened to SquareEnix
08-06-2018T01:41:05,ZRO4825,They tried too hard to do everything on their own for too long. Now they're trying to play catch-up.
08-06-2018T01:41:17,unsteddyphoenix,Nintendo would released 6 kingdom hearts and 3 FF7 remakes
08-06-2018T01:41:21,unsteddyphoenix,wouldve*
08-06-2018T01:41:34,FenceEqualizer,At least we would have it by now.
08-06-2018T01:41:57,ZRO4825,"Like the FFXIII series and FFXV were all done on an in-house programming system. That SE finally gave up on just in the past few years, I believe."
08-06-2018T01:42:32,ZRO4825,"So I'd wager a lot of their time's been spent trying to make that work and then when they finally gave it up, they're having to convert everything to Unreal 4 or whatever they're choosing to use now."
08-06-2018T01:43:07,FenceEqualizer,Apparently they're still going to use the  luminous system
08-06-2018T01:46:43,TheFDdriver,crap...i came too late...
08-06-2018T01:46:57,FenceEqualizer,Hajime Tabata is going to be on side projects that utilize the engine that was used for FFXV which is good cause it would have been a waste to spend all that time for nothing
08-06-2018T01:47:07,unsteddyphoenix,or just build their own engine
08-06-2018T01:47:49,SageSaga,so i finally switched from CrunchyRoll to VRV
08-06-2018T01:48:19,unsteddyphoenix,Whyd you change?
08-06-2018T01:48:40,FenceEqualizer,What's VRV?
08-06-2018T01:48:52,SageSaga,because VRV has Crunchyroll too and also Funimation and RoosterTeeth and more
08-06-2018T01:49:25,unsteddyphoenix,"Ahh, but you know what it DOESNT have"
08-06-2018T01:49:35,MagicEnchilladas,netflix?
08-06-2018T01:49:38,SageSaga,so i went from paying 7 dollars a month to 10 dollars a month for what i already have + Funimation + RoosterTeeth and other stuff i like too
08-06-2018T01:49:38,unsteddyphoenix,Availability in my region :ptv-dealwithit:
08-06-2018T01:49:46,Bgrmystr2,hahahaha aww phoenix
08-06-2018T01:49:49,FenceEqualizer,Ooooooo
08-06-2018T01:49:55,MagicEnchilladas,how unfortunate
08-06-2018T01:50:03,FenceEqualizer,But that sounds like a good deal Sage
08-06-2018T01:50:07,unsteddyphoenix,Does it give access to the stuff behind the paywall for roosterteeth?
08-06-2018T01:50:12,SageSaga,yes
08-06-2018T01:50:30,SageSaga,and i had been paying for Roosterteeth too - my support for RWBY
08-06-2018T01:50:31,Bgrmystr2,wooah
08-06-2018T01:50:33,Bgrmystr2,nice
08-06-2018T01:50:42,unsteddyphoenix,"Thats cool, im using my sisters account lol"
08-06-2018T01:50:43,SageSaga,so im paying less now and getting more
08-06-2018T01:50:47,Bgrmystr2,how much is the paywall for roosterteeth
08-06-2018T01:50:52,Bgrmystr2,to watch stuff early
08-06-2018T01:50:52,SageSaga,i watched all of MHA again- Dubbed
08-06-2018T01:50:53,unsteddyphoenix,like $5
08-06-2018T01:50:55,SageSaga,the dub is good
08-06-2018T01:51:03,FenceEqualizer,Wait does VRV have like a deal with all these services? How does that work?
08-06-2018T01:51:06,unsteddyphoenix,They also have exclusive stuff
08-06-2018T01:51:17,Bgrmystr2,"then yeah if you want Roosterteeth, then VRV is immediately cheaper than doing crunchyroll+RT separate"
08-06-2018T01:51:25,unsteddyphoenix,Like 20 minutes after their podcast ends and theyre completely hammered
08-06-2018T01:51:35,FenceEqualizer,Feels like that would be cutting into there revenue.
08-06-2018T01:51:55,SageSaga,more content wider audience
08-06-2018T01:54:12,SageSaga,anyone considering getting more than one of them would get VRV and then tell all their friends about all this OTHER content they found on there that they like
08-06-2018T01:54:35,SageSaga,like i am now- because i finally got to watch HarmonQuest and that is hilarious
08-06-2018T01:56:03,unsteddyphoenix,"Plus someone might not be already the free services for two things, then see a deal to get extras to both for cheaper"
08-06-2018T01:56:16,unsteddyphoenix,"Oops, might be using the free"
08-06-2018T01:56:41,unsteddyphoenix,"It mightve worked on me, iffff I could get it~"
08-06-2018T01:57:36,SageSaga,generally though- if you have one of their services- i would recommend getting VRV - i think it is worth it- or try it out- 30 day trial
08-06-2018T02:00:21,FenceEqualizer,It's a good deal. If only so you don't have to deal with having anime split into two groups.
08-06-2018T02:03:00,darkzoned,030
08-06-2018T02:04:25,SageSaga,i need to get the new Opening for MHA for my playlist
08-06-2018T02:05:36,SageSaga,i also need to rename the next minor character in this comic-
08-06-2018T02:06:40,SageSaga,"i just re-read the script and i was like ""Wat- how did that name get in here?"""
08-06-2018T02:07:05,MagicEnchilladas,what was the name?
08-06-2018T02:08:42,ZRO4825,:thinking:
08-06-2018T02:10:04,SageSaga,it was very similar to the name of a man that throws salt as a special attack
08-06-2018T02:10:40,unsteddyphoenix,I...hmm..
08-06-2018T02:11:17,MagicEnchilladas,mr satan from DB?
08-06-2018T02:11:23,SageSaga,...
08-06-2018T02:11:33,SageSaga,y'all need culture
08-06-2018T02:11:50,MagicEnchilladas,indeed
08-06-2018T02:12:00,unsteddyphoenix,anime isnt culture
08-06-2018T02:12:07,SageSaga,XD
08-06-2018T02:12:31,unsteddyphoenix,I feel LESS cultured after I watch anime
08-06-2018T02:12:39,unsteddyphoenix,Who the hell throws salt?
08-06-2018T02:12:42,MagicEnchilladas,"wouldst thou enlighten us swine, m'lord"
08-06-2018T02:12:52,unsteddyphoenix,Does he banish cute demon girls?
08-06-2018T02:12:56,SageSaga,http://www.s1e1.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/reigen-is-cool-640x350.jpg
08-06-2018T02:13:25,unsteddyphoenix,"If he was REALLY cool he'd wear the jacket like a cape, thats what the cool anime dudes do"
08-06-2018T02:13:26,FenceEqualizer,Mob 100 I can't rememberh is name for the life of me
08-06-2018T02:13:43,unsteddyphoenix,Ohhh I actually did watch Mob lol
08-06-2018T02:14:00,FenceEqualizer,His freaking salt attacks
08-06-2018T02:14:05,SageSaga,then you know about his Hypnotic Punch attack too
08-06-2018T02:14:23,Bgrmystr2,did not bother watching that
08-06-2018T02:14:26,Bgrmystr2,wasn't interested :C
08-06-2018T02:14:45,unsteddyphoenix,High-CHA character
08-06-2018T02:14:53,SageSaga,wth BGR
08-06-2018T02:14:58,MagicEnchilladas,Vali ight be an acceptable name to change it to
08-06-2018T02:15:03,Bgrmystr2,"also, the fuck Fence, his name is in the link"
08-06-2018T02:15:04,Bgrmystr2,xD
08-06-2018T02:15:14,Bgrmystr2,how did you manage that
08-06-2018T02:15:23,Bgrmystr2,"yeah I'm not a fan of that kinda stuff, sage"
08-06-2018T02:15:24,unsteddyphoenix,hypnosis punch is unblockable
08-06-2018T02:15:24,Bgrmystr2,go figure :v
08-06-2018T02:15:26,unsteddyphoenix,OP OP
08-06-2018T02:15:33,FenceEqualizer,Meant for earlier. When Sage said Salt attacks
08-06-2018T02:15:44,SageSaga,did you not like One Punch Man?
08-06-2018T02:15:44,FenceEqualizer,I was sitting here trying to remember his name that whole time
08-06-2018T02:16:08,MagicEnchilladas,it was too overhyped by my friends so that sort of ruined it for me
08-06-2018T02:16:12,unsteddyphoenix,^
08-06-2018T02:16:21,unsteddyphoenix,Wait no
08-06-2018T02:16:53,Bgrmystr2,One Punch Man was not really supernatural
08-06-2018T02:16:58,MagicEnchilladas,"wasnt bad, just not as wonderous as they described"
08-06-2018T02:17:52,SageSaga,wait- how was OPM not Supernatural?
08-06-2018T02:18:27,unsteddyphoenix,I'd say superheros are supernatural
08-06-2018T02:18:41,Bgrmystr2,cuz it's no more supernatural than My Hero Academia
08-06-2018T02:18:44,MagicEnchilladas,"except Genos, he was scifi"
08-06-2018T02:18:48,Bgrmystr2,"I would disagree, phoenix"
08-06-2018T02:18:57,Bgrmystr2,supernatural is like.. ghosts and stuff
08-06-2018T02:19:13,Bgrmystr2,like what's that anime we watched during Halloween
08-06-2018T02:19:27,SageSaga,Ghost Hunt
08-06-2018T02:19:32,Bgrmystr2,Yeah
08-06-2018T02:19:39,SageSaga,you didnt like Ghost Hunt?
08-06-2018T02:19:45,Bgrmystr2,It was okay
08-06-2018T02:19:50,SageSaga,XD
08-06-2018T02:19:53,Bgrmystr2,wasn't really my thing tho
08-06-2018T02:20:00,Bgrmystr2,:u
08-06-2018T02:20:45,SageSaga,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VopWPhozmNw
08-06-2018T02:22:18,FenceEqualizer,Love and hate that fight. Seeing Mob get his face kicked in like that man.
08-06-2018T02:22:25,Dadrobit,"Alright, I think I'm gonna head to bed. Have a good one y'all!"
08-06-2018T02:22:46,SageSaga,the animation is stellar
08-06-2018T02:22:56,MagicEnchilladas,that is true
08-06-2018T02:23:20,FenceEqualizer,Night Robit!
08-06-2018T02:23:25,SageSaga,night Dadrobit
08-06-2018T02:23:38,JamesBSquirrel3,Speaking the Ghost Town.
08-06-2018T02:23:40,MagicEnchilladas,goodnight robit
08-06-2018T02:23:57,Bgrmystr2,"damn, that is some MHA level fight right there"
08-06-2018T02:24:32,JamesBSquirrel3,Do someone know or they not about the song?
08-06-2018T02:25:00,SageSaga,thats not even the best fight
08-06-2018T02:25:14,Bgrmystr2,"Are you talking about the playlist Sage has playing right now, James?"
08-06-2018T02:25:27,Bgrmystr2,cuz that's from the movie Your Name
08-06-2018T02:25:33,Bgrmystr2,the soundtrack is really good
08-06-2018T02:31:06,JamesBSquirrel3,Wow! Tom done early?! About more than 3 and the Half Hours?! Gosh Tom now he goes to sleep and he deverve it well.
08-06-2018T02:31:51,Bgrmystr2,"James, you're new here, so I'm going to say none of that is how it works."
08-06-2018T02:31:57,JamesBSquirrel3,Damn it I flet a sleep + overslept again!!
08-06-2018T02:32:09,unsteddyphoenix,it took him like 10 minutes to realise tom was offline lmao
08-06-2018T02:32:15,Bgrmystr2,hahaha
08-06-2018T02:32:33,Bgrmystr2,Tom doesn't sleep this early
08-06-2018T02:32:49,Bgrmystr2,and tom usually stops streaming around the time he stopped today
08-06-2018T02:32:56,Bgrmystr2,give or take an hr or so
08-06-2018T02:33:08,Bgrmystr2,nothing is out of the ordinary
08-06-2018T02:33:39,JamesBSquirrel3,"Eh, no. There's no work today for me - is Saturday as a weekend. The work will go as Weekdays as always."
08-06-2018T02:34:52,JamesBSquirrel3,"No need to tell me, I know this as my Rota Routine."
08-06-2018T02:35:09,Bgrmystr2,"You're not tom, so I'm not talking about you xD"
08-06-2018T02:36:06,Bgrmystr2,yknow.. I dunno why I bother :c
08-06-2018T02:36:13,JamesBSquirrel3,Anyway; SageSaga is still on while I was flet asleep (a bit)?
08-06-2018T02:37:14,Bgrmystr2,yeah sage is still on
08-06-2018T02:37:19,JamesBSquirrel3,Right it still ther Sage it is.
08-06-2018T02:40:28,JamesBSquirrel3,"Oh! And Nero(pan) already finish as well (while I was falling asleep this time), that he (Nero) new(?)"
08-06-2018T02:41:23,JamesBSquirrel3,I mean Nero did a great + fantastiv job!
08-06-2018T02:41:55,SageSaga,this is my third time trying to add new music-
08-06-2018T02:41:59,unsteddyphoenix,Well said James!
08-06-2018T02:42:00,SageSaga,i dont know why its not working
08-06-2018T02:42:24,unsteddyphoenix,Hmm :T
08-06-2018T02:42:31,unsteddyphoenix,odd thing to glitch out
08-06-2018T02:43:06,JamesBSquirrel3,"So Nero with her character done like this, did he say ""Steve/Stevette""?"
08-06-2018T02:43:19,MagicEnchilladas,"steve, just steve"
08-06-2018T02:44:09,JamesBSquirrel3,Great(!):ptv-scratch: Just like Nero calls whatever he want.
08-06-2018T02:44:11,Bgrmystr2,holycrap
08-06-2018T02:44:14,unsteddyphoenix,oh music again
08-06-2018T02:44:14,Bgrmystr2,that was so loud
08-06-2018T02:45:11,JamesBSquirrel3,Speaking why music so loud?
08-06-2018T02:45:43,ElicitConnor,"If you use one, what graphics tablet do you use?"
08-06-2018T02:45:56,SageSaga,Cintiq 13WX HD Touch
08-06-2018T02:46:21,ElicitConnor,Oooh. Nice one!
08-06-2018T02:47:20,SageSaga,im hoping at some point i can update to a MobileStudio 16
08-06-2018T02:48:37,SageSaga,but that's expensive XD
08-06-2018T02:48:40,SageSaga,its almost 3k
08-06-2018T02:49:22,unsteddyphoenix,jeez. How could that be worth it?
08-06-2018T02:49:40,SageSaga,its a 4k screen
08-06-2018T02:49:53,SageSaga,and is a PC all its own-
08-06-2018T02:49:58,MagicEnchilladas,and hopefully durability
08-06-2018T02:50:04,unsteddyphoenix,gaming tablet where
08-06-2018T02:50:17,SageSaga,its not a gaming tablet
08-06-2018T02:50:28,MagicEnchilladas,"ah the age old question, can it run doom"
08-06-2018T02:50:32,unsteddyphoenix,For 3k it should be
08-06-2018T02:51:36,SageSaga,https://us-store.wacom.com/Product/wacom-mobilestudio-16-s01#/undefined1
08-06-2018T02:52:51,MagicEnchilladas,"so the answer is yes, it can"
08-06-2018T02:53:24,unsteddyphoenix,Damn running a CAD program on it would be interested
08-06-2018T02:53:28,unsteddyphoenix,interesting*
08-06-2018T02:53:37,SageSaga,they need to update it and lower the price tbh
08-06-2018T02:53:38,unsteddyphoenix,Oh hey! Free shipping too! :D
08-06-2018T02:54:01,SageSaga,but- it can be used as a display or a stand alone- which is perfect for me
08-06-2018T02:54:12,SageSaga,i can take it on the go- and i can hook it right up to my PC and draw
08-06-2018T02:54:39,SageSaga,honestly though- with how good Laptops are getting and how light-
08-06-2018T02:54:51,ZRO4825,laptops are evil
08-06-2018T02:55:14,w0lfmare,"Off for tonight, thanks for streamin'!"
08-06-2018T02:55:24,SageSaga,i could just get the non-computer version and pick up a light laptop
08-06-2018T02:55:30,SageSaga,take care W0lf
08-06-2018T02:55:31,MagicEnchilladas,night w0lf
08-06-2018T02:55:41,unsteddyphoenix,'night w0lfie
08-06-2018T02:55:41,Bgrmystr2,gnight w0lf
08-06-2018T02:55:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night W0LfY
08-06-2018T02:55:57,unsteddyphoenix,that would probably be cheaper lol
08-06-2018T02:56:06,unsteddyphoenix,But then you have to look after TWO things instead of one
08-06-2018T02:56:48,SageSaga,yeah but at the size i could fit em both into one small bag
08-06-2018T02:57:05,SageSaga,but they need to update their stand alone too!
08-06-2018T02:57:19,SageSaga,they screwed that up recently - it is what is driving tom mad
08-06-2018T02:57:33,Bgrmystr2,how the hell do those things manage to not overheat?
08-06-2018T02:58:01,unsteddyphoenix,"its costs 3k bgr, thats how"
08-06-2018T02:58:24,Bgrmystr2,$3k doesn't tell me how the thing cools.
08-06-2018T02:59:33,SageSaga,https://us-store.wacom.com/Product/wacom-cintiq-pro-16-creative-pen-display-touch#/undefined1
08-06-2018T02:59:42,SageSaga,see the issue with that thing?
08-06-2018T03:01:38,Bgrmystr2,I.. don't.
08-06-2018T03:01:54,Bgrmystr2,but I dunno what I'd be looking for so
08-06-2018T03:02:10,SageSaga,they have a controller with it
08-06-2018T03:02:19,SageSaga,instead of just putting buttons on the darn thing
08-06-2018T03:02:35,ZRO4825,"expresskey remote, eh? &lt;_&gt;;"
08-06-2018T03:02:37,unsteddyphoenix,another thing to lose!
08-06-2018T03:02:50,SageSaga,The controller is what has been screwing Tom up - when you hear Tom complaining about his tablet- its because of that piece of junk
08-06-2018T03:02:50,Bgrmystr2,is.. that a problem? :thinking:
08-06-2018T03:03:03,unsteddyphoenix,oh really?
08-06-2018T03:03:03,unsteddyphoenix,huh
08-06-2018T03:03:09,Bgrmystr2,does it like.. not work or something?
08-06-2018T03:03:11,SageSaga,it constantly disconnects
08-06-2018T03:03:26,Bgrmystr2,that's not good
08-06-2018T03:03:29,ZRO4825,That's....really dumb.
08-06-2018T03:03:35,SageSaga,if you arent pressing a button on it every minute it goes to sleep and then sometimes doesnt wake up!
08-06-2018T03:03:44,Bgrmystr2,thefok
08-06-2018T03:03:56,unsteddyphoenix,"cant you like, change that to not happen"
08-06-2018T03:04:08,SageSaga,now think of it this way- the Mobile Studio is like perfect-
08-06-2018T03:04:14,Bgrmystr2,"I would expect that, yeah phoenix, but I dunno"
08-06-2018T03:04:27,SageSaga,it has buttons on it- it connects like any normal thing- why not just take the computer part out and use that?
08-06-2018T03:04:42,SageSaga,no you cant Unsteddy- theres no modifying it
08-06-2018T03:04:54,MagicEnchilladas,"no i imagine that the sleep mode is programmed in, the sleep mode should have been a switch"
08-06-2018T03:05:04,unsteddyphoenix,...interesting design choice
08-06-2018T03:05:09,SageSaga,yeah the sleep mode is hardware
08-06-2018T03:05:34,Bgrmystr2,"I imagine there is something you can mess with it, cuz it being called sleep mode would indicate that it would have other modes"
08-06-2018T03:05:51,Bgrmystr2,"least, tis what I'd figure"
08-06-2018T03:06:00,SageSaga,it turns itself off from not being used and then has to wake up and reconnect every time
08-06-2018T03:06:07,SageSaga,rather than just going into a low power mode
08-06-2018T03:07:01,SageSaga,it also has an issue where it wont come back on and you have to basically remove the battery and put it back in
08-06-2018T03:07:07,SageSaga,known issue too not just a rare thing
08-06-2018T03:07:15,Bgrmystr2,hmm
08-06-2018T03:07:20,MagicEnchilladas,thats terrible craftsmenship
08-06-2018T03:07:24,Bgrmystr2,that's not really good at all
08-06-2018T03:08:00,unsteddyphoenix,How does it sell if that's a known issue
08-06-2018T03:08:10,unsteddyphoenix,thats so annoying
08-06-2018T03:08:24,SageSaga,they would save money by just using a slightly different case with Mobile Studio and take out all the parts that makes it a mobile studio!
08-06-2018T03:08:46,Bgrmystr2,"people don't always look at known issues, phoenix"
08-06-2018T03:08:50,SageSaga,most people have the older version and didnt upgrade-
08-06-2018T03:08:58,MagicEnchilladas,"because it is not a recall worthy issue, just an inconvienence so the company doesnt have to care"
08-06-2018T03:09:20,unsteddyphoenix,When making such a bug purchase i'd hope most people would do their research
08-06-2018T03:09:41,ZRO4825,"I did my research for the night. Ain't worth staying on Overwatch, the idiots are out in force."
08-06-2018T03:09:50,Bgrmystr2,"I, too, sometimes purchase bugs from time to time."
08-06-2018T03:11:06,unsteddyphoenix,&gt;:T
08-06-2018T03:11:34,Bgrmystr2,hahaha
08-06-2018T03:11:35,Bgrmystr2,&lt;3
08-06-2018T03:11:36,SageSaga,https://us-store.wacom.com/Product/cintiq-22hd-interactive-pen-display#/undefined1
08-06-2018T03:11:51,SageSaga,they still have this available XD
08-06-2018T03:14:17,unsteddyphoenix,hm? Whats this?
08-06-2018T03:14:19,SageSaga,wth- they dont have the MobileStudio i5 version-
08-06-2018T03:14:47,Mihari,Did they ever?
08-06-2018T03:14:54,SageSaga,yeah
08-06-2018T03:14:58,SageSaga,it was 500 dollars cheaper
08-06-2018T03:15:14,Mihari,That's surprising because you'd think hyperthreading would be a must in a cad tablet.
08-06-2018T03:15:34,SageSaga,yeah that version wasnt made for Cad - just stuff that i do and photo editors
08-06-2018T03:16:26,SageSaga,the Surface Pro needs to go more Pro
08-06-2018T03:17:24,unsteddyphoenix,pro+
08-06-2018T03:17:39,SageSaga,i bought one and tried it out- and returned it the next day
08-06-2018T03:17:43,SageSaga,so disapointed
08-06-2018T03:20:51,SageSaga,i think it was a Surface Pro 4
08-06-2018T03:21:39,SageSaga,yeah just checked- it was
08-06-2018T03:28:31,SageSaga,man i cant even find the pen specs for the new Surface Pros
08-06-2018T03:29:18,SageSaga,i hope it isnt still simulated pressure
08-06-2018T03:34:31,SageSaga,good talk
08-06-2018T03:35:07,ZRO4825,lol
08-06-2018T03:35:35,ZRO4825,Well it's not like most of the rest of us have any room to talk on'em. We're all nublets with these tablets and pens and stuff. :P
08-06-2018T03:35:41,ZRO4825,Or...at least most of us are? :thinking:
08-06-2018T03:35:53,SageSaga,"was hoping someone would be like ""Hey! I found a portable drawing tablet alternative that is cheaper!"" XD"
08-06-2018T03:36:00,ZRO4825,XD
08-06-2018T03:36:13,unsteddyphoenix,Thats true. Im just borrowing a cheap $90 one lol
08-06-2018T03:36:44,ZRO4825,"I mean, technically my Intuos is portable, buuut...I don't quite think it's what you're lookin for. :P"
08-06-2018T03:37:00,unsteddyphoenix,Also watching a Detroit andriod game playthrough since I have no PS4
08-06-2018T03:37:08,unsteddyphoenix,Game looks really cool though
08-06-2018T03:37:09,SageSaga,im just terrified that im gonna have to find one when one dies rather than buying it because i want to upgrade
08-06-2018T03:37:15,SageSaga,forced upgrades are the worse
08-06-2018T03:37:50,ZRO4825,"Yeah, can't argue that. Nothing like suddenly NEEDING to upgrade to rip the careful planning step out of the process"
08-06-2018T03:38:18,SageSaga,thats why i have this current Cintiq- my Companion was having charging issues so i had to send it in - but it was going to take a MONTH to repair!
08-06-2018T03:38:39,ZRO4825,"Yeah, that's not really acceptable considering your job"
08-06-2018T03:38:53,unsteddyphoenix,Dont you still have your older tablets though?
08-06-2018T03:38:56,SageSaga,yep- so i went out and bought a surface pro 4 and i was like
08-06-2018T03:38:58,unsteddyphoenix,"like, a bunch"
08-06-2018T03:39:04,SageSaga,omg its sooo hot- but it sucks for drawing!
08-06-2018T03:39:29,SageSaga,so i ended up buying the Cintiq 13WXHD Touch
08-06-2018T03:39:39,SageSaga,waited for that to come in then sent in the companion
08-06-2018T03:39:56,SageSaga,even used the Cintiq 13WX box to send it back XD
08-06-2018T03:40:02,unsteddyphoenix,Shouldve kept it as a trophy-tablet
08-06-2018T03:40:16,SageSaga,and yeah i still have an old Cintiq 13 but the colors on it are TERRIBLE
08-06-2018T03:40:32,SageSaga,garbage tier
08-06-2018T03:40:44,SageSaga,and i have the intuos 3 but the pad is peeling
08-06-2018T03:41:52,unsteddyphoenix,"You could just look at the colours on your monitor though, right?"
08-06-2018T03:42:11,SageSaga,...
08-06-2018T03:43:24,unsteddyphoenix,!?
08-06-2018T03:43:26,SageSaga,i guess you dont get how infuriating it is having to move your stuff to a different monitor only to realize your blues are green and your greens are yellow
08-06-2018T03:43:46,SageSaga,and your skin tones are ALL KINDS OF MESSED UP
08-06-2018T03:44:33,ZRO4825,I personally don't understand how in this day and age we haven't figured out how to make ALL monitors/TVs display all the damned colors the same. &lt;_&lt;;;
08-06-2018T03:44:38,unsteddyphoenix,"I mean like, you could look at your monitor while youre drawing to check"
08-06-2018T03:45:10,unsteddyphoenix,"The pad I use doesnt have a screen in the first place, maybe its more annoying than im imagining"
08-06-2018T03:45:29,SageSaga,but it is a monitor- and i dont normally duplicate my monitor when running multiple monitors
08-06-2018T03:45:54,SageSaga,do you have 2 monitors?
08-06-2018T03:46:01,unsteddyphoenix,yeah
08-06-2018T03:46:16,SageSaga,ok - imagine you are drawing one one of them-
08-06-2018T03:46:43,SageSaga,and now every time you pick a color- you have to move it to the other monitor just to make sure its the right color- because you cant trust the monitor you are on
08-06-2018T03:47:00,SageSaga,a monitor that cost you a thousand dollars and is MADE FOR ART
08-06-2018T03:47:39,unsteddyphoenix,"Hahaha, yeah why didnt you return it?"
08-06-2018T03:48:09,SageSaga,because at the time it was the best thing i could afford
08-06-2018T03:48:21,NightServant,Why not get a small extra monitor and have it clone the tablet screen?
08-06-2018T03:48:24,unsteddyphoenix,How annoying
08-06-2018T03:48:53,Bgrmystr2,"If I was drawing on a tablet, I'd have monitor cloned just for checking colors"
08-06-2018T03:48:54,unsteddyphoenix,"Still, i'd just put the art on both monitors"
08-06-2018T03:48:57,Bgrmystr2,if I needed them
08-06-2018T03:49:01,unsteddyphoenix,And sacrifice whatever I was watching
08-06-2018T03:49:09,Bgrmystr2,Just attach more monitors.
08-06-2018T03:49:13,Bgrmystr2,:u
08-06-2018T03:49:23,NightServant,yeah
08-06-2018T03:49:25,SageSaga,i did end up checking the colors all the time back then anyways
08-06-2018T03:49:36,SageSaga,but it was a serious pain- i couldnt do that again
08-06-2018T03:49:59,unsteddyphoenix,too spoilt now~ I understand
08-06-2018T03:50:19,unsteddyphoenix,Like how we couldnt go back to watching 240p youtube videos
08-06-2018T03:50:49,ZRO4825,I tried that once.
08-06-2018T03:50:53,ZRO4825,My eyes still hurt.
08-06-2018T03:51:24,unsteddyphoenix,If I lost one of my monitors I imagine it'd be incredibly annoying
08-06-2018T03:53:33,SageSaga,and done
08-06-2018T03:53:37,Bgrmystr2,"Lost one of mine, it was horrible"
08-06-2018T03:53:51,unsteddyphoenix,:clap::clap: nice~
08-06-2018T03:53:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nicely done sage
08-06-2018T03:54:01,ZRO4825,Good speed on that page :o
08-06-2018T03:54:22,Bgrmystr2,lookin nice :D
08-06-2018T03:54:24,SageSaga,not really- took almost 3 hours T_T
08-06-2018T03:54:38,ZRO4825,From nothing to inks in 3 hours? :thinking:
08-06-2018T03:54:41,SageSaga,and it needs some fixing that i will do tomorrow
08-06-2018T03:54:48,SageSaga,yeah thats bad for me
08-06-2018T03:54:53,SageSaga,should be able to do that in 2
08-06-2018T03:55:10,ZRO4825,"You DID spend more time than usual chatting tonight it seemed, lol"
08-06-2018T03:55:17,SageSaga,not really
08-06-2018T03:55:23,SageSaga,i chat like this often
08-06-2018T03:55:31,Bgrmystr2,"hm, really? sage chats like this often yeah"
08-06-2018T03:55:56,ZRO4825,"Yeah, but it was a bit more non stop tonight than usual I felt....but eh, eye of the beholder and all that :x"
08-06-2018T03:58:16,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, I presume youre all sleeping, so goodnight"
08-06-2018T03:58:29,unsteddyphoenix,sweet dreams~
