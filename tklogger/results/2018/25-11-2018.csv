25-11-2018T00:32:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm bundled under the covers with my lil heater going
25-11-2018T00:33:17,Vatruvius,I was more so looking for a temperature reading...

25-11-2018T00:33:46,SpazztasticKiwi,But it‚Äôs going down to 33

25-11-2018T00:34:02,RimaDraws,but it might get there soon
25-11-2018T00:35:38,Vatruvius,"About the same here, our little storm just finished and left yesterday so everything should be iced over in the morning."

25-11-2018T00:58:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I will...
25-11-2018T00:58:30,Vatruvius,"Well, so much for my witty comment about how Tom is never off..."
25-11-2018T00:58:39,SpazztasticKiwi,In about 45 minutes
25-11-2018T00:59:01,Twokinds,Even artists sleep.
25-11-2018T00:59:46,SpazztasticKiwi,You‚Äôre an artist?
25-11-2018T00:59:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Never knew
25-11-2018T01:00:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,this is news
25-11-2018T01:00:05,unsteddyphoenix,"Artists dont sleep, they just take long breaks"

25-11-2018T01:02:19,Dadrobit,Probably me
25-11-2018T01:02:47,Dadrobit,"It's too damn cold to be awake, and I'm unemployed until I get my computer back."
25-11-2018T01:03:04,Dadrobit,54 degrees. Ludicrous.
25-11-2018T01:03:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Its 47 here.
25-11-2018T01:03:31,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs gone to 48 now
25-11-2018T01:04:06,Dadrobit,"I hope you have your wills written, because I don't believe you're going to survive the night."
25-11-2018T01:04:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"lol, dude this is comfy for me"
25-11-2018T01:05:47,Dadrobit,"Alas, poor Marv! I knew him, Tom; a fellow of infinite jest."
25-11-2018T01:07:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"speaking of infinite, I wonder if he's finally a sleep"
25-11-2018T01:08:05,Vatruvius,Not likely...
25-11-2018T01:08:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"yeah, probably gathering more anime memes"
25-11-2018T01:08:42,Dadrobit,"It's only 11 around here, but it is a school night, so maybe?"
25-11-2018T01:10:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I hope for sleep, expect 'rest'"
25-11-2018T01:15:36,Twokinds,"I've been getting bad sleep lately, and I don't know why."
25-11-2018T01:15:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Workin too hard?
25-11-2018T01:16:13,Twokinds,USUALLY I sleep like a rock.
25-11-2018T01:17:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Well I usually do too and my sleep‚Äôs been abysmal too
25-11-2018T01:17:16,SpazztasticKiwi,But I‚Äôve been at work a lot so
25-11-2018T01:17:18,Twokinds,I think it might be diet related.
25-11-2018T01:17:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,make any changes to it recently?
25-11-2018T01:17:35,unsteddyphoenix,Too much healthy food?
25-11-2018T01:17:36,SpazztasticKiwi,What diet
25-11-2018T01:17:37,Twokinds,I DID kind of eat four bags of spicy takis over the course of three days.
25-11-2018T01:17:45,Dadrobit,shudders
25-11-2018T01:17:47,unsteddyphoenix,Ah.

25-11-2018T01:17:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Uh yeah
25-11-2018T01:18:05,Vatruvius,That MAY have had something to do with it...
25-11-2018T01:18:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Spicy food isn‚Äôt gonna help sleep
25-11-2018T01:18:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,maybe you should have a few apple slices then go to bed?
25-11-2018T01:18:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Especially right before bed
25-11-2018T01:18:32,Twokinds,"Luckily, I'm out."
25-11-2018T01:18:41,Twokinds,So now hopefully I'll sleep fine.
25-11-2018T01:18:42,Dadrobit,Of apples or takis?
25-11-2018T01:18:48,Twokinds,takis
25-11-2018T01:19:02,Twokinds,"Well... no, I was going to say I was out of apples, but I do have one left."

25-11-2018T01:20:34,SpazztasticKiwi,No idea what‚Äôs for breakfast or lunch
25-11-2018T01:20:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I got too much junk food.  should do some shopping as well
25-11-2018T01:20:59,Dadrobit,:( Pizza for breakfast sounds so nice. I'm back on healthy foods. I need to cut about 10-20 lbs.

25-11-2018T16:29:53,Twokinds,I slept really good last night so yeah. I guess so.
25-11-2018T16:34:54,iliar,I'm wondering. San thinking about Colin as big fluffy doggo. She not think about him in sexual context. At least for now.
25-11-2018T16:35:04,iliar,Am I right?
25-11-2018T16:36:02,Twokinds,lol

25-11-2018T16:42:09,Xexanoth,@Iliar wasn't sam totally giving Colin bedroom eyes in one of the colored sketches? (i would look it up but patreon is ebing a dick right now)
25-11-2018T16:42:44,Mippy,I usually drink it straight but today I felt like making it gay. (In other words...I needed some comfort tea)

25-11-2018T16:51:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Mega fluff
25-11-2018T16:51:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Like a Colin cloud

25-11-2018T16:53:34,Mippy,Yup
25-11-2018T16:54:10,Dadrobit,Especially when I was working graveyards in security and had to sleep while the AZ sun was blazing
25-11-2018T16:54:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel a nap
25-11-2018T16:55:00,Mippy,*looks outside* gotta love those 2:30 PM sunsets

25-11-2018T16:56:40,Mippy,We typically only get a few hours in the winter...if we see the sun at all through the clowds
25-11-2018T16:57:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"Night before last, we had a beautiful moon out"
25-11-2018T16:57:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Last night? Clouds. Nothing but clouds
25-11-2018T16:58:59,Dadrobit,5:21 is the setting time tonight.
25-11-2018T16:59:48,Dadrobit,Had nice wispy clouds that still let the moon shine at 80% so everything was still well lit. Almost slept outside honestly it was so nice.
25-11-2018T17:00:46,AFilthyLeaf,is tom still here?
25-11-2018T17:01:11,Mippy,The narrator for this audio book has such a nice accent
25-11-2018T17:02:17,Dadrobit,Hmmmmm. Is the book a bromance?
25-11-2018T17:03:13,Dadrobit,"Also, what isn't nice, is that this repair shop still hasn't gotten back to me with an update on their diagnostic on my computer."
25-11-2018T17:03:29,Mippy,If you look at it sideways I guess.... :ctwokinds-floraquestion: It‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Once and Future King‚Äù

25-11-2018T17:04:16,Dadrobit,"Can confirm, that was definitely not me."
25-11-2018T17:05:17,Mippy,XD you‚Äôve done audio books? Nice. I knew you did games
25-11-2018T17:05:36,Dadrobit,"I think I'm about to head on out to talk to these guys in person though. Was supposed to be called late Saturday or early today for a quote on my repair so I can decide on either repair, or get a new one on cyber Monday."
25-11-2018T17:06:10,Mippy,"See ya later Dad, I wish you luck with your computer"

25-11-2018T17:08:05,AFilthyLeaf,also impressive
25-11-2018T17:08:18,Dadrobit,I was getting a degree in video game design at ASU way back in yonder days.
25-11-2018T17:08:25,Bgrmystr2,"Visual Novel, dadro"

25-11-2018T17:09:36,Dadrobit,Dude transferred schools and had to hook up with one of (or secretly optionally all of) the girls he befriends at the school.
25-11-2018T17:10:06,Bgrmystr2,sounds like 20% of all of them.
25-11-2018T17:10:12,Dadrobit,Pretty much
25-11-2018T17:10:16,Bgrmystr2,did the girls happen to be aliens or whatever?
25-11-2018T17:10:28,Dadrobit,"Nah, they just differed in stature and personality."

25-11-2018T17:11:43,Bgrmystr2,"good trope, imo, but standard nonetheless"
25-11-2018T17:11:46,Dadrobit,"Maybe? This was like a decade ago, I just got a script."
25-11-2018T17:12:01,Bgrmystr2,ahh you never saw the completed game?
25-11-2018T17:12:31,Dadrobit,"Nope, I saw parts of it and did some QA, but I never got my hands on the full copy."
25-11-2018T17:12:51,Bgrmystr2,"that's kinda shitty, you should have gotten a copy having worked on it"
25-11-2018T17:12:56,Dadrobit,Made something like $200 though. So that was kinda nice.
25-11-2018T17:13:32,Dadrobit,And he finished it while I was busy dropping out from poor life choices.
25-11-2018T17:13:41,Dadrobit,So whatevs.
25-11-2018T17:13:56,Bgrmystr2,ahh

25-11-2018T19:59:17,LOGANWOLF,When you eat food you chew with your skeleton
25-11-2018T19:59:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"no, you use your teeth silly"
25-11-2018T19:59:35,Mippy,"Wow, Monday stream. Back with Rose and Trace I see"

25-11-2018T20:00:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Science Bitch
25-11-2018T20:00:50,ThingsAreMoving,you can't chew with your skeleton. you need cheeks for chewing
25-11-2018T20:00:54,Bgrmystr2,cuz that's how anything works xD
25-11-2018T20:00:59,LOGANWOLF,I did not know that and im in my third year in high school
25-11-2018T20:00:59,ThingsAreMoving,therefore you chew with your mouth
25-11-2018T20:01:06,ThingsAreMoving,QED
25-11-2018T20:01:08,Bgrmystr2,"lol things, don't bring logic into this"
25-11-2018T20:01:10,Bgrmystr2,noone else has.
25-11-2018T20:01:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,If you scream Science Bitch loud enough it becomes true

25-11-2018T20:02:22,Mippy,Who thought you did not need cheek muscles to chew?

25-11-2018T20:04:40,Mippy,Every time you show up Heresy I want to call you Hershey. Then I think of Chocolate.
25-11-2018T20:05:36,LOGANWOLF,I recommend this music as the theme song for TwoKinds.     New Horizons - Antti Martikainen
25-11-2018T20:05:51,LOGANWOLF,Or the credits
25-11-2018T20:05:56,CrimsonHelsing,First frame for some reason reminds me of the secret lab scenes and sequences in Young Frankenstein
25-11-2018T20:06:42,Bgrmystr2,"well you'd have to email him so he can look at it when he's not streaming, logan"
25-11-2018T20:07:09,LOGANWOLF,"Oh, sorry didnt know"

25-11-2018T20:11:17,ThingsAreMoving,"how old are you and what country are you from, logan?"
25-11-2018T20:11:27,ThingsAreMoving,there are ways to earn monies
25-11-2018T20:11:39,ThingsAreMoving,...that didn't sound creepy at all xD
25-11-2018T20:11:42,LOGANWOLF,17 years old and im in USA Texas
25-11-2018T20:11:59,ThingsAreMoving,can you sell plasma if you're not 18yo?

25-11-2018T20:12:59,LOGANWOLF,I work with my dad in a DJ buissness as a photobooth guy
25-11-2018T20:13:29,ThingsAreMoving,so it's not the lack of income that's preventing you from getting those emotes
25-11-2018T20:13:37,Mippy,Part time job that‚Äôs reliable ?
25-11-2018T20:15:31,Mippy,Wonder if Trace will ever recover his full memories?
25-11-2018T20:16:08,ThingsAreMoving,That would be an epic mindscape battle.

25-11-2018T20:18:08,Mippy,I figure there would be two ways that could go. Either he dose not learn and goes back to being Psychotic or he gets aspects of he old personality but learns from the experience and sets about putting things right
25-11-2018T20:18:32,Mippy,I suppose that is pretty obvious :ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
25-11-2018T20:18:54,ThingsAreMoving,I'm more interested how will Raine's interaction with Rose look like.
25-11-2018T20:20:10,Mippy,Don‚Äôt know. Depends on if Raine can see Rose. Ghosts only appear to those they want to see them.
25-11-2018T20:20:39,MrMongMong,Is she dead?
25-11-2018T20:20:47,ThingsAreMoving,:ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot: not sure if I follow

25-11-2018T20:40:52,unsteddyphoenix,Laptops arent built to last
25-11-2018T20:40:59,MrMongMong,D:
25-11-2018T20:41:14,Dadrobit,"Repair guy got it almost functional, but it was still showing signs of slowing down and had a crash."
25-11-2018T20:41:43,Bgrmystr2,aww
25-11-2018T20:41:56,Bgrmystr2,what errors were they getting?
25-11-2018T20:42:00,Dadrobit,"Better than when I brought it in, but not something I can get work done on."
25-11-2018T20:43:02,LOGANWOLF,Im back
25-11-2018T20:43:03,Bgrmystr2,maybe it's time to upgrade to a ryzen that works well with your software
25-11-2018T20:43:07,Dadrobit,A single overheat error was all his diagnostics tools were able to come up with. The SSD part I thought was dead) was perfectly fine.
25-11-2018T20:43:08,MrMongMong,Hi Logan.
25-11-2018T20:43:21,Dadrobit,(part*
25-11-2018T20:43:27,Dadrobit,wb Logan
25-11-2018T20:43:37,LOGANWOLF,got back from eating tacos
25-11-2018T20:44:02,Bgrmystr2,overheat errors.. lol
25-11-2018T20:44:07,Dadrobit,98% sure it's the board going out based on other problems like how it no longer charges.
25-11-2018T20:44:21,LOGANWOLF,lol
25-11-2018T20:44:41,Dadrobit,Least he's not charging me anything for it.
25-11-2018T20:45:22,LOGANWOLF,Nice pun
25-11-2018T20:45:38,Bgrmystr2,prolly not exactly intentional
25-11-2018T20:46:08,Dadrobit,"Tried running it off another image of 7, and one of 10 as well to see if there was just an issue with my OS or my factory reset image, but both times showed the same issues as before."
25-11-2018T20:46:30,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, yeah then it's definitely gonna be hardware-related"
25-11-2018T20:46:45,MrMongMong,"At this point, it may be a good idea to throw it at a wall."
25-11-2018T20:46:56,Dadrobit,Noooooooo
25-11-2018T20:46:58,Bgrmystr2,a laptop motherboard is practically the price of the whole thing..
25-11-2018T20:47:06,MrMongMong,It's time to let go...
25-11-2018T20:47:06,unsteddyphoenix,percussive maintenence
25-11-2018T20:47:12,MrMongMong,It lived a good life.
25-11-2018T20:47:15,Bgrmystr2,replacing the mobo will generally cost as much as replacing the whole thing.
25-11-2018T20:47:20,Bgrmystr2,just too much of a hassle
25-11-2018T20:47:29,MrMongMong,Time to say goodbye.
25-11-2018T20:47:52,MrMongMong,It's what it would have wanted.
25-11-2018T20:47:59,Dadrobit,"Yeah, he was pricing the parts plus man hours at around $300."
25-11-2018T20:48:17,LOGANWOLF,Have you guys seen the audiobook for twokinds in yt?
25-11-2018T20:48:23,MrMongMong,REALLY?
25-11-2018T20:48:31,ThingsAreMoving,I despise audiobooks.
25-11-2018T20:48:45,ThingsAreMoving,"so nah, I haven't"
25-11-2018T20:48:48,MrMongMong,"Wait, nevermind."
25-11-2018T20:48:50,Bgrmystr2,"those are all fan-dubs, logan"
25-11-2018T20:49:01,LOGANWOLF,i found i
25-11-2018T20:49:03,Bgrmystr2,haven't seen any yet that are any good.
25-11-2018T20:49:03,MrMongMong,I don't like the voices. It's too enthusiastic.
25-11-2018T20:49:07,Dadrobit,So he just reset it back to 7 Pro and got me some drivers that let it function somewhat.
25-11-2018T20:49:42,MrMongMong,It's time to *no pun intended* pull the plug.
25-11-2018T20:49:44,Dadrobit,I quite like audiobooks. The TK fandubs? Very hit and miss. More often miss.
25-11-2018T20:50:03,ThingsAreMoving,"Your line of work doesn't require a laptop with strong graphics card, does it?"
25-11-2018T20:50:08,MultaniRaynz,i take it you're using your phone
25-11-2018T20:50:13,ThingsAreMoving,only Ram and storage space?
25-11-2018T20:50:26,Dadrobit,There was one attempt forever ago that kinda had some quality to it.
25-11-2018T20:51:28,Dadrobit,"Nah, not really. A gpu would take the strain off of the gnarly cpu drain a bit I would assume though."
25-11-2018T20:51:49,MoonDance,Hiya

25-11-2018T20:52:15,Bgrmystr2,GPUs aren't really used for rendering audio to my knowledge
25-11-2018T20:52:33,Dadrobit,BGR is correct. But they are often used anyways.
25-11-2018T20:52:42,PotatoRights,Hi everyone
25-11-2018T20:52:52,ThingsAreMoving,"nah, I wasn't sure id Dad was doing film edits or some other shenanigans"
25-11-2018T20:53:08,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, you could, but would it be effective? You'd have to manually use them like supercomputers do"
25-11-2018T20:53:13,Combak,HiPotato.
25-11-2018T20:53:19,Dadrobit,I do a little bit. Audio post-production for video.
25-11-2018T20:53:19,Bgrmystr2,it wouldn't do audio naturally
25-11-2018T20:53:33,ThingsAreMoving,well a decent spec laptop without a powerhouse of a gpu shouldn't be too expensive methinks
25-11-2018T20:53:40,EggRollss,TOM you can't kill me now
25-11-2018T20:53:49,Combak,... Isn't Rose supposed to be taking Trace to Flora?

25-11-2018T20:54:17,Bgrmystr2,Weren't they going to stop somewhere first?
25-11-2018T20:54:24,Bgrmystr2,he did say he wanted to talk to her
25-11-2018T20:54:36,Bgrmystr2,so likely this is that.
25-11-2018T20:54:45,Bgrmystr2,"or rather, a continuation of that."

25-11-2018T21:02:18,Dadrobit,"I can, Potato."
25-11-2018T21:02:27,Dadrobit,The answer is: Maybe.
25-11-2018T21:02:32,LOGANWOLF,I finally downloaded the app version of picarto
25-11-2018T21:02:34,RimaDraws,possibly
25-11-2018T21:02:36,LOGANWOLF,Lol
25-11-2018T21:02:37,PotatoRights,-_-
25-11-2018T21:02:45,Bgrmystr2,potentially.
25-11-2018T21:02:51,LOGANWOLF,The website version is bad xd
25-11-2018T21:02:53,Bgrmystr2,it is a possibility. :ptv-SteelwormHades:
25-11-2018T21:03:00,Ordithus,There's a chance

25-11-2018T21:03:42,Bgrmystr2,and tom prolly hasn't bothered to think about it cuz it's not likely relevant to the story for anytime in the near or late future
25-11-2018T21:03:43,LOGANWOLF,Im on phone and it was frustrating to get the site version loading xd
25-11-2018T21:03:44,Bgrmystr2,so..
25-11-2018T21:04:04,LOGANWOLF,So i downloaded the app version instead
25-11-2018T21:04:14,Bgrmystr2,generally the gist of how those questions go.
25-11-2018T21:04:50,PotatoRights,"It would be cool to see someday, someone suggests drawing some undrawn keidran"
25-11-2018T21:05:15,LOGANWOLF,I like the lighting effect on that window and the door

25-11-2018T21:10:27,PotatoRights,Yeah sure
25-11-2018T21:10:28,CrRAR,Someone could magic up some enchanted feather dusters.

25-11-2018T21:12:34,CrimsonHelsing,it's the study

25-11-2018T21:12:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,plus ultra evil study
25-11-2018T21:12:57,Dadrobit,"You would be correct, Potato. But bringing it up over and over again until it annoys him is a great way for Tom to make up lore that goes like: There were Arctic Foxes. But Trace killed them all. You'll only ever see their pelts."
25-11-2018T21:13:32,CrRAR,haha
25-11-2018T21:13:36,PotatoRights,Ok then
