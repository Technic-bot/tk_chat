04-09-2018T01:38:48,Bgrmystr2,flawless
04-09-2018T01:38:57,Dadrobit,"Mmmm, have a place nearby called Pizza Pie Cafe that specializes in that kinda stuff. Pretty good overall, though they miss the mark on some things."
04-09-2018T01:59:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Go make something. It‚Äôs not like we can
04-09-2018T02:01:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Though my GPS says it‚Äôs a 9 hourish drive
04-09-2018T02:02:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Still not happening
04-09-2018T02:02:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Do people ever gift you snacks at conventions Tom?
04-09-2018T02:03:18,TheBeckoner,Seems like rando food could be dangerous
04-09-2018T02:03:25,TheBeckoner,I would decline
04-09-2018T02:03:37,TheBeckoner,dont want hiv or something
04-09-2018T02:03:55,unsteddyphoenix,I guess if its prepackaged
04-09-2018T02:04:07,SpazztasticKiwi,People do it alot at cons for Jack
04-09-2018T02:04:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Cookies and cakes and candy
04-09-2018T02:05:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Pretty sure Mark gets stuff occasionally too. It kinda worries me cause the issue of someone may actually try poisoning them
04-09-2018T02:06:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Among other possibilities
04-09-2018T02:06:46,Twokinds,"Mmm, poison cookies..."
04-09-2018T02:06:52,unsteddyphoenix,You have to trust people at some point
04-09-2018T02:07:13,unsteddyphoenix,Forbidden donut~
04-09-2018T02:09:21,Dadrobit,"Yeah, we had to have people sign paperwork and write reports whenever someone would gift us food in security. Too many people trying to screw us over."
04-09-2018T02:10:00,Dadrobit,"Give the security guard some pot brownies, then call in an hour later ""complaining"" that they think security might be on drugs."
04-09-2018T02:10:14,Dadrobit,People are assholes like that.
04-09-2018T02:10:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean it‚Äôs a nice gesture but I‚Äôm not that trusting
04-09-2018T02:10:42,Dadrobit,call in police*
04-09-2018T02:10:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Plus there‚Äôs allergies
04-09-2018T02:12:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"Ethan refuses edible gifts cause he‚Äôs allergic to peanuts, but I can‚Äôt see myself eating something that‚Äôs made by someone I don‚Äôt know"
04-09-2018T02:18:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I guess it‚Äôs an individual judgment thing. Hopefully nothing happens. But I‚Äôm off to üõå

04-09-2018T12:43:52,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds Morning!
04-09-2018T12:49:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Looks like Tom‚Äôs not awake yet
04-09-2018T12:50:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, it‚Äôs raining today. As soon as I step out of my car, W O O S H"
04-09-2018T12:50:14,CrimsonQuill,A cup of tea might fix that.
04-09-2018T12:51:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Nominated for the ice bucket challenge via the clouds
04-09-2018T12:51:58,iliar,@Twokinds I'm interested. What Syria was thinking about about Trace and Nora relationship. I mean after wedding. Does she jealous of Trace to Nora?
04-09-2018T12:56:18,Twokinds,"Nora never took human form in canon, so Saria just saw Nora as ""that dragon that hangs out with Trace sometimes."""
04-09-2018T12:58:01,CrimsonQuill,"@Twokinds What would happen if she met Smaug from The Hobbit? Both book and film version, considering both Nora and Smaug are quite powerful (Though Smaug has no magic spells)?"
04-09-2018T12:59:45,Twokinds,"I don't know, I haven't see or read The Hobbit"
04-09-2018T13:01:24,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds Really? I highly recommend the book. The films were...not as good....but the book is simply brilliant.
04-09-2018T13:01:52,CrimsonQuill,"It's in the universe of Lord of the Rings-set just 60 years before the events, as a matter of fact."
04-09-2018T13:02:25,iliar,@Twokinds I could be wrong. But in the TDM Syria was disapproved of their relationship. And then. If people know about royal dragons I think they should understand that for the dragons the species barrier is not a barrier.
04-09-2018T13:03:11,iliar,"And yes, I understand that human Nora is not canon."
04-09-2018T13:04:53,iliar,It we talking about books. Did you read Terry Pratchett?
04-09-2018T13:06:17,CrimsonQuill,"Did you say TERRY PRATCHETT, Iliar?"
04-09-2018T13:07:03,CrimsonQuill,"I know you're asking Tom, but I am really glad that I'm not the only reader of his books on this chat."

04-09-2018T20:00:18,MidNightBlue78,They give out free things like that sometimes
04-09-2018T20:00:33,Ordithus,The coffee at work is free.  Doesn't make it taste any better

04-09-2018T20:03:43,Dadrobit,"So wait, did he just take the customer's card at the 7th transaction and then pocket them for a rainy day?"
04-09-2018T20:04:39,Ordithus,Sounds like coffee fraud :cop:
04-09-2018T20:04:59,MidNightBlue78,Send the coffee police!!!!
