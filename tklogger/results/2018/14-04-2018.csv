14-04-2018T14:01:50,Vatruvius,The number of live hospitals save outway tge lives lost. Not to mention the number of lives hospitals bring into this world. A lot of deaths are from hospitals trying to save lives. Sometimes it is beyond their capability to do so...does not mean it is
14-04-2018T14:02:00,Vatruvius,not worth trying.

14-04-2018T15:56:31,PalmettoPathfinder1,I had requested Adelaide and Natani dressed up as Western Basitin.  But I'm okay with this.  Great minds think alike!
14-04-2018T15:56:32,Dadrobit,Keith was a Pokemon
14-04-2018T15:56:52,ThingsAreMoving,"You might still get your suggestion later on, Palmetto"
14-04-2018T15:56:54,MadMaxton,There's a Twokinds Discord server?
14-04-2018T15:56:56,BadFoMo,"Maddie: Why do I have to be blindfolded, mom?"
14-04-2018T15:56:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Well they say fathers that have daughters live longer. Though a coworker of mine told me it seemed having a daughter was taking years off
14-04-2018T15:57:00,Sunfish43,Oh cool I don't think I saw that one! I remember Trace and Flora as them though
14-04-2018T15:57:06,CrRAR,lil nibble

14-04-2018T15:57:46,CrRAR,lol
14-04-2018T15:57:55,MadMaxton,Is that the Master Spy? Sirus?
14-04-2018T15:58:04,vladtet909,Isn't that just a surgeon?
14-04-2018T15:58:06,ThingsAreMoving,so yours might still be on poll later on
14-04-2018T15:58:09,Ordithus,"Haha, still blushing despite the blindfold"
14-04-2018T15:58:09,ItsActuallyKopyKat,He's in awe of her presence
14-04-2018T15:58:12,Vexd,"Yep, that's a surgon"
14-04-2018T15:58:16,PhilTheIdle,i'd say nurse
14-04-2018T15:58:19,PalmettoPathfinder1,That's correct.  Although my request and this one are pretty much almost exactly alike.
14-04-2018T15:58:19,Vatruvius,It would take years off Kiwi as soon as the reality hits that she is no longer Daddy's little princess.
14-04-2018T15:58:22,ItsActuallyKopyKat,&gt;seethrough blindfold
14-04-2018T15:58:23,Bgrmystr2,xD that face

14-04-2018T15:58:43,Katfeathers,.... wonder if Bastin and other Keriden have wiskers that are useualy just undrawn
14-04-2018T15:58:45,ThingsAreMoving,He can HEAR the lewdness
14-04-2018T15:58:48,Kynum,x3
14-04-2018T15:58:54,SpazztasticKiwi,He has a daughter that just turned 5 or 6 (something like that)

14-04-2018T15:59:17,CrRAR,"not radar, but lewd-ar?"
14-04-2018T15:59:17,Ordithus,@Sunfish43 It's also so the patient isn't hesitant about being seen by a doc... apparently it's embarassing to need help
14-04-2018T15:59:32,ItsActuallyKopyKat,^^ Cr
14-04-2018T15:59:34,MadMaxton,"I know that, but I thought maybe Sirus was undercover in the basitin kingdom and teaching King Adelaide how to go undercover."
14-04-2018T15:59:49,BadFoMo,???: what is this tail like thing comeing out of your chest?
14-04-2018T15:59:50,unsteddyphoenix,lol he painted it blind

14-04-2018T16:00:24,BadFoMo,Never mind.

14-04-2018T16:00:46,PalmettoPathfinder1,Ugh.  I keep getting whispered by a troll.
14-04-2018T16:01:00,Sunfish43,I think the cannon is that all Basitin surgeons are doctors because they got injured. And because they are warrior race it may be better to die than to live as a surgeon
14-04-2018T16:01:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Block em
14-04-2018T16:01:07,Sunfish43,Thanks dad
14-04-2018T16:01:08,ItsActuallyKopyKat,@Palmetto...block?
14-04-2018T16:01:10,Kynum,"well, it might not be a doctor, though. Just someone that was either commanded or opted to have a blindfold for this task."
14-04-2018T16:01:27,Arcus27,"Opted, I bet"
14-04-2018T16:01:29,BadFoMo,@PalmettoPathfinder1 Copy/paste Spamer?
14-04-2018T16:01:32,Bgrmystr2,I dunno palm. What did they say?
14-04-2018T16:01:42,Dadrobit,The real kicker is that Tom didn't use Alaric for this task. He woulda' been perfect for this job.
14-04-2018T16:01:44,BadFoMo,*spammer
14-04-2018T16:01:45,Bgrmystr2,Context matters
14-04-2018T16:01:55,ItsActuallyKopyKat,alaric wouldn't have opted for the blindfold
14-04-2018T16:01:56,Ordithus,"'cept he dead, robit"
14-04-2018T16:01:56,Vexd,"Use the magic block button, Palm"
14-04-2018T16:02:01,unsteddyphoenix,youre so right dad
14-04-2018T16:02:09,Sunfish43,"This might be racist, but that Basitin really does look a lot like Keith"
14-04-2018T16:02:12,ThingsAreMoving,Lynn would be the perfect pick

14-04-2018T16:02:17,ThingsAreMoving,no blindfolds needed either
14-04-2018T16:02:17,DRAGONTANOPUG,Left
14-04-2018T16:02:21,Kamaro12,it's funnier to have a more reserved basitin painting her

14-04-2018T16:38:01,unsteddyphoenix,reni great for kids

14-04-2018T16:38:38,TheBeckoner,ahhh terrible noise
14-04-2018T16:38:41,ProsePro7,Is Natani a little too tall?

14-04-2018T16:42:19,TerraTheWizard,lol things
14-04-2018T16:42:22,Bgrmystr2,:thumbsup:

14-04-2018T16:42:47,ValSalianResident,So how do loincloths work when you have a tail I wonder?
14-04-2018T16:43:04,Bgrmystr2,tail goes through hole probably
14-04-2018T16:43:05,Bgrmystr2,or under
14-04-2018T16:43:05,Ordithus,"Beneath the tail, val"
14-04-2018T16:43:07,unsteddyphoenix,only one side
14-04-2018T16:43:08,DarthKeidran,Your tail is the back of the loincloth.
14-04-2018T16:43:12,PalmettoPathfinder1,Yeah Val I was wondering the same too.
14-04-2018T16:43:21,ThingsAreMoving,"only cover the front, the tail covers the back"
14-04-2018T16:43:24,unsteddyphoenix,You wouldnt need a loincloth back if your tail is floof enough
14-04-2018T16:43:34,Ordithus,I think we've seen such on Sythe
14-04-2018T16:43:38,Vexd,"Or it just ties in the back, but that means your butt would hang out"
14-04-2018T16:43:42,ValSalianResident,"Kinda wanna request Natani making the same mistake she did with robes, just this time with loincloths"
14-04-2018T16:43:44,DarthKeidran,"There was a sketch where Sythe was drunk, tail up, and Raine got terrified."
14-04-2018T16:44:07,ItsActuallyKopyKat,??
14-04-2018T16:44:08,PalmettoPathfinder1,Oh!  I would love see that Val!

14-04-2018T16:44:12,Katfeathers,could have a split that tyes over the tail
14-04-2018T16:44:12,Zakuru,i napped and here we are lol
14-04-2018T16:44:12,ItsActuallyKopyKat,I didn't see that one

14-04-2018T16:44:27,Katfeathers,bloody shpelling
14-04-2018T16:44:29,BadFoMo,That reminds me. How would the white paint show up on Raine? She would need to be a Human. ...I think I could live with that.
14-04-2018T16:44:45,Ordithus,"Me too, FoMo, me too"
14-04-2018T16:44:57,ValSalianResident,"Huh, nice find, Ord."
14-04-2018T16:45:15,DarthKeidran,This is the first time we’re seeing Nat colored in a sketch!

14-04-2018T16:45:55,TerraTheWizard,time go go further; wild western!
14-04-2018T16:45:56,PalmettoPathfinder1,They would use black paint on Raine. Also I wonder what Natani's tribal markings will be.
14-04-2018T16:46:05,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Nat is a man, so she is dressed like one"
14-04-2018T16:46:08,Ordithus,"Because Natani is a dude, @abrachoo"

14-04-2018T16:46:08,TerraTheWizard,pew pew
14-04-2018T16:46:13,BluePhantom90,I take Nat is Tom's choice or just wanted to add her
14-04-2018T16:46:15,Katfeathers,she lost a bet w/ Addie?
14-04-2018T16:46:17,MrEase,cause maybe its the traditional male garb

14-04-2018T18:30:15,PalmettoPathfinder1,Hi Combak we were talking about Jim Carrey as the voice of Trave

14-04-2018T18:32:02,PalmettoPathfinder1,Also the guy who play some Spider Man now might be a good voice for Trace.

14-04-2018T22:13:22,Ordithus,I suspect there will be a higher concentration of TK fans there than at San Diego

14-04-2018T22:13:36,Bgrmystr2,"you usally end up on the ground, so if the ground is sticky for whatever reason, then maybe"
14-04-2018T22:14:22,FenceEqualizer,Why I can never go to a Furry convention without able bodied to block me
14-04-2018T22:14:52,unsteddyphoenix,lol hire bodyguards to jump in front of glomps
14-04-2018T22:14:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"yeah, and a taser won't work on the fursuits, trust me on that"

14-04-2018T23:35:30,Vatruvius,I am currently watching Acquisitions Incorporated.

14-04-2018T23:37:26,Vatruvius,Is it stalking if these people upload videos of themselves...I don't think so.

14-04-2018T23:39:13,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s down right precious
14-04-2018T23:39:22,Vatruvius,Umm...mid life crisis?
14-04-2018T23:39:50,TheBeckoner,29? Midlife?
14-04-2018T23:40:01,TheBeckoner,I dont really think so...
14-04-2018T23:40:07,SpazztasticKiwi,29 on the 24th
14-04-2018T23:40:31,TheBeckoner,40 is midlife right? coz average age till death is like 80 or so
14-04-2018T23:40:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Eh
14-04-2018T23:40:46,Vatruvius,He is 29 and acts 15...some sort of crisis.
14-04-2018T23:41:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m convinced he’s a bundle of butterflies in the shape of a human
14-04-2018T23:41:15,Vatruvius,Early adult life crisis?
14-04-2018T23:41:36,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s a mess is what he is
14-04-2018T23:41:41,Vatruvius,Humans are not bundles of butterflies Kiwi.
14-04-2018T23:42:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Have you seen his videos? Not sure he’s human sometimes
14-04-2018T23:42:22,Vatruvius,I have not...I am worried to look.
14-04-2018T23:43:08,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s really funny. Try a vine comp - they’re everywhere on YT
14-04-2018T23:43:20,unsteddyphoenix,No dont
14-04-2018T23:43:22,Vatruvius,I never watched a vine.
14-04-2018T23:43:29,unsteddyphoenix,Once you click one they infect your recommendations like a virus
14-04-2018T23:43:48,unsteddyphoenix,It's too late for me save yourselves~
14-04-2018T23:45:02,Vatruvius,"Okay...there is incognito...but I just spent literally 1,300 videos reestablishing my recommendations so..."

14-04-2018T23:46:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I just remove them from my history and my recommendeds stay unchanged

14-04-2018T23:46:37,unsteddyphoenix,Is that...is that what Subnautica is?
14-04-2018T23:46:38,SpazztasticKiwi,But subnautica is life
14-04-2018T23:46:41,unsteddyphoenix,"I thought it was like, a horror game"
14-04-2018T23:46:48,SpazztasticKiwi,It can be a horror game
14-04-2018T23:47:09,Twokinds,I mean if you consider being stuck out in the middle of an endless sea 'horror'
14-04-2018T23:47:12,Vatruvius,Don't curse Subnautica...that is an awesome game. You are talking to a alpha player here!
14-04-2018T23:47:28,unsteddyphoenix,"'Course no. What am I, a big baby?"
14-04-2018T23:47:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I like the reapers
14-04-2018T23:47:40,Twokinds,I did really enjoy Subnautica.
14-04-2018T23:47:44,Vatruvius,Um...horror game to Tom's brother.
14-04-2018T23:47:55,SpazztasticKiwi,You finished it already?
14-04-2018T23:47:59,Twokinds,But I don't generally like most of the other crap that's flooded Steam
14-04-2018T23:48:03,unsteddyphoenix,"Ive heard good things, might get around to it later"
14-04-2018T23:48:15,SpazztasticKiwi,You know there’s whispers of another coming out
14-04-2018T23:48:24,unsteddyphoenix,"Mmm, all those ""alphas"" that never finish"
14-04-2018T23:48:30,SpazztasticKiwi,But as a DLC thing or something
14-04-2018T23:48:30,BluePhantom90,lol could play that free game called Amorous. lol
14-04-2018T23:48:56,Twokinds,Especially since most of them are multiplayer focused
14-04-2018T23:48:57,SpazztasticKiwi,A picky game person 🧐 sophisticated
14-04-2018T23:49:02,Twokinds,And I couldn't care less about multiplayer.
14-04-2018T23:49:03,Vatruvius,I really do not look at recommended games anymore. I look at sales or the ftont store page and that is it. Given up on the recommendations.
14-04-2018T23:49:24,unsteddyphoenix,I just get what people recommend to me~
14-04-2018T23:49:42,Twokinds,I put 79 hours into my playthrough of Subnautica before I beat it. I think that's pretty signifigent.
14-04-2018T23:49:49,Vatruvius,Yeah Kiwi...winter DLC for Subnautica. It is official...not a whisper.
14-04-2018T23:49:50,NightMeaty22,That moment when you finish a really good game or book then you are depressed
14-04-2018T23:49:51,unsteddyphoenix,Rimworld was on sale after I saw you could  tame squirrels
14-04-2018T23:49:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t do multiplayer because there’s never anyone to play with who are enjoyable
14-04-2018T23:50:04,unsteddyphoenix,Damn.
14-04-2018T23:50:20,Twokinds,"Yeah I guess Rimworld is technically a survival crafting game too. Darn it, they've got me."
14-04-2018T23:50:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"Winter Subnautica. Not only are you wet, but now you’ll be cold too. Great"
14-04-2018T23:50:43,unsteddyphoenix,It worked~
14-04-2018T23:50:59,BluePhantom90,you know you get out of the chain of playing survival games Tom! You play a really crappy one!
14-04-2018T23:51:09,Vatruvius,Yeah...I have a number of multiplayer games...most from when I had a group to play with. Now I have no one. :ptv-sad:
14-04-2018T23:51:10,Twokinds,I'm just waiting for Pillars of Eternity 2 to come out...
14-04-2018T23:51:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I play mostly mobile stuff. Can’t always have my computer with me
14-04-2018T23:52:23,Ordithus,Nowadays I play more board games than video games
14-04-2018T23:52:45,unsteddyphoenix,"Ahh yeah, that looks good."
14-04-2018T23:52:53,Vatruvius,Pff...what kind of life do you live Kiwi where you do not have your computer! Just...give up the sun...don't worry...it is completely safe!
14-04-2018T23:53:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’m not social, per se, but I do have errands"
14-04-2018T23:53:48,SpazztasticKiwi,And those take you out of the house
14-04-2018T23:53:53,Twokinds,I did get some sun the other day
14-04-2018T23:54:05,unsteddyphoenix,Nowadays those types of games are the only ones I can play for extended periods...
14-04-2018T23:54:10,SpazztasticKiwi,A full two minute tan?
14-04-2018T23:54:12,unsteddyphoenix,Oh no are you ok?
14-04-2018T23:54:18,Vatruvius,422 games...wow...smashes my collection to pieces.
14-04-2018T23:54:20,Twokinds,"Yeah, barely"
14-04-2018T23:54:22,BluePhantom90,"Btw Tom I didn't notice you e-mailed me back in Jan 24th thanking me on the idea's and ""Side comic"" script Crimson and I been working on"
14-04-2018T23:54:22,Ordithus,"Tell me, what did it look like?"
14-04-2018T23:54:37,Twokinds,bright
14-04-2018T23:54:44,Vatruvius,lol
14-04-2018T23:54:45,Ordithus,Oooh
14-04-2018T23:54:55,Twokinds,I replaced the oil in my lawnmower and mowed my lawn.
14-04-2018T23:54:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I open my window sometimes. That count?
14-04-2018T23:55:09,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: you did adult things?!
14-04-2018T23:55:11,Ordithus,"I go outside, but where I live, we don't get spring.  We get ""the grey"""
14-04-2018T23:55:15,BluePhantom90,well gtg call night
14-04-2018T23:55:16,Bgrmystr2,Tom are you injured anywhere
14-04-2018T23:55:21,unsteddyphoenix,"Ah, I too do that"
14-04-2018T23:55:27,Twokinds,"Yeah. Not even riding, I had to push it."
14-04-2018T23:55:30,Bgrmystr2,Oh no
14-04-2018T23:55:31,Vatruvius,"I wake up to the sun every morning...shines right into my bedroom. I like it...but not when it makes playing games hard. ""I can't see anything...the sun is too bright! *closes blinds* Much better."""
14-04-2018T23:55:32,unsteddyphoenix,So relatable!
14-04-2018T23:55:33,SpazztasticKiwi,You actually have grass growing right now?
14-04-2018T23:55:34,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
14-04-2018T23:55:36,Twokinds,"Sigh, times are tough."
14-04-2018T23:55:43,unsteddyphoenix,It's a hard knock life.
14-04-2018T23:56:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"We have rain, and therefore a ton of mud"
14-04-2018T23:56:10,unsteddyphoenix,How common are riding mowers? I feel like ive never seen one irl
14-04-2018T23:56:17,Vatruvius,I have a riding mower...not worth it really because I have like a 1/2 acre of lawn to mow.
14-04-2018T23:56:21,Ordithus,Very common in US
14-04-2018T23:56:21,Twokinds,"This morning I woke up at noon, and 1 and 2."
14-04-2018T23:56:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"Early rising, I see"
14-04-2018T23:56:31,Twokinds,And then one last time at 2:20
14-04-2018T23:56:35,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
14-04-2018T23:56:38,Vatruvius,lol
14-04-2018T23:56:48,unsteddyphoenix,I understand on a spiritual level
14-04-2018T23:56:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Gotta get moving early for that diet
14-04-2018T23:57:01,TheBeckoner,"We have a tractor to mow with, but also a riding lawn mower"
14-04-2018T23:57:04,unsteddyphoenix,My friends made fun of me for having an alarm at 12~
14-04-2018T23:57:04,Vatruvius,Sun shines into my room at 7:20 ish...it really shines to the point where you cannot sleep at 8:30
14-04-2018T23:57:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a blanket over my window
14-04-2018T23:57:23,Twokinds,Kinda wish I had a wall clock.
14-04-2018T23:57:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Sun cannot enter
14-04-2018T23:57:28,Twokinds,Or an alarm clock
14-04-2018T23:57:30,TheBeckoner,I had to wake up at 6:20 for job training the other day...bleh
14-04-2018T23:57:34,Twokinds,I have to ask my computer what time it is.
14-04-2018T23:57:37,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s what the phone’s for
14-04-2018T23:57:39,unsteddyphoenix,Did you know that you can use cellphones to...
14-04-2018T23:57:40,Bgrmystr2,I wake up between 2pm and 3pm central for streams.
14-04-2018T23:57:42,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
14-04-2018T23:57:47,unsteddyphoenix,Such a pain living in the future
14-04-2018T23:57:55,unsteddyphoenix,Have to TALK to my electronics
14-04-2018T23:57:56,Vatruvius,I hate my alarm...it is awful. I thought it was good but it is not. Just has that terrible fire alarm type.
14-04-2018T23:57:59,unsteddyphoenix,Then my cat comes over...
14-04-2018T23:58:01,Twokinds,I feel like Alexa gets annoyed by me constantly asking what time it is every half hour before I can be bothered to get up.
14-04-2018T23:58:18,SpazztasticKiwi,“Look for yourself for once”
14-04-2018T23:58:23,unsteddyphoenix,JUDGING
14-04-2018T23:58:34,Twokinds,"It is nice living in the future, though."
14-04-2018T23:58:54,unsteddyphoenix,Thats true
14-04-2018T23:58:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Alexa. Isn’t she being reported to randomly laugh
14-04-2018T23:59:01,TorqueEmUp,But it isn't the future. It's the present
14-04-2018T23:59:02,unsteddyphoenix,"Im too soft to handle the past, I think"
14-04-2018T23:59:06,unsteddyphoenix,or the present
