24-10-2018T01:44:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Spare sleep is found when you schedule your life. But always make sure you make health - including sleep - a prioritized memo

24-10-2018T20:08:51,Dadrobit,"Nah, it wasn't the band playing it, they used the loudspeakers to play Thunderstruck. The band just stood in formation on the field to welcome them."
24-10-2018T20:09:07,Bgrmystr2,aww dadro that makes me sad
24-10-2018T20:09:11,Bgrmystr2,you guys didn't play it? :(
24-10-2018T20:09:15,Bgrmystr2,that would have been amazing
24-10-2018T20:09:38,Ordithus,They're from my hometown :D
24-10-2018T20:09:53,Ordithus,"Well, basically"
24-10-2018T20:09:57,Dadrobit,"Nah, the band's opening sequence was just a mix of the school's songs and patriotic songs."
24-10-2018T20:10:21,Dadrobit,Then halftime would be whatever we had practiced for the month.
24-10-2018T20:11:06,SpazztasticKiwi,My school had Friday pep rallys at the end of the day
24-10-2018T20:11:16,SpazztasticKiwi,With mosh pit

24-10-2018T20:11:57,Dadrobit,"Favorite shows probably split between the Beetles show, and the 9/11 tribute."
24-10-2018T20:14:51,SpazztasticKiwi,We often all gathered for a Veterans Day event where the band played some songs
24-10-2018T20:16:01,SpazztasticKiwi,The anthem was often sung by a music teacher or something and then they‚Äôd play one whose name I can‚Äôt remember
24-10-2018T20:18:06,Dadrobit,"Yeah, Veteran's Day meant a lot to ASU as well. One our the alumni was Pat Tillman. Dude was a superstar linebacker who went on to play in the Az Cardinals."
24-10-2018T20:18:39,Dadrobit,"After 9/11, he gave up his career to enlist in the Army, and was later kia."
24-10-2018T20:19:44,Dadrobit,"Part of our tributes always had him in it with formations creating the letters ""PT"" and or ""42"" his number."
24-10-2018T20:21:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Some of the oddest habits came from the band kids
24-10-2018T20:21:49,SpazztasticKiwi,And footballers
