05-07-2018T14:10:54,TheGamePlayer,I almost touched a squirrel it was in arms reach it was so cute
05-07-2018T14:12:40,TheGamePlayer,"And before you ask why I didn't, it's because squirrels tend to be very unexpected, they will attack if they feel even slightly threatened"
05-07-2018T14:16:56,TheGamePlayer,Or just run away
05-07-2018T14:20:33,TheGamePlayer,XD yes my state allows squirrels to be kept as pets.
05-07-2018T14:26:32,TheGamePlayer,Oh wait it's a squirrel monkey
