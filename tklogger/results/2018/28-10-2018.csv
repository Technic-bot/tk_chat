28-10-2018T01:42:12,SpazztasticKiwi,🛌💤
28-10-2018T02:17:30,DarthRexKing,Goodnight everyone.
28-10-2018T12:08:45,Twokinds,The sketches are going to be posted slightly out of order. I'd like to cluster all the halloween related ones around the holiday.
28-10-2018T12:09:57,Xexanoth,"OH NO, SO TERRIBLE :ptv-shock: /s"
28-10-2018T12:10:33,Twokinds,"I know, I'm sorry!"
28-10-2018T12:10:54,Xexanoth,your punishment shall be: drawing even more sketches!
28-10-2018T12:12:13,iliar,I think this is a good idea.
28-10-2018T12:15:19,iliar,"I know. No my sketches on this week. Therefore, my opinion is a little biased. But if they were, I wouldn't mind to move them to the end of the line."

28-10-2018T12:36:11,Dadrobit,Sounds like a plan
28-10-2018T12:36:13,Xexanoth,You Shall Not Pass!...wait wrong franchise.
28-10-2018T12:41:50,Twokinds,Oh!
28-10-2018T12:42:27,Twokinds,"Wow... uh, my red dead ps4 arrived just now. It wasn't supposed to arrive yet."
28-10-2018T12:42:35,Xexanoth,Nice
28-10-2018T12:42:41,Twokinds,"Aw, now it's going to be sitting here cause I can't play it. XD"
28-10-2018T12:42:49,Xexanoth,well
28-10-2018T12:43:02,Xexanoth,it's like seeing the presents under the tree at chrismas XD
28-10-2018T12:43:23,Xexanoth,just teasing you
28-10-2018T12:43:29,Twokinds,Haha yeah
28-10-2018T12:43:35,Twokinds,The halloween presents
28-10-2018T12:44:26,Dadrobit,"Well, on the bright side when you do get to play it in a few weeks, by then the internet will be full of guides if you need them for anything that's got you stuck."
28-10-2018T12:47:30,Xexanoth,"and they might have patched out most of the problems, PS4 seems to have gotten the short end of the stick with RDR2"
28-10-2018T12:47:50,Dadrobit,Really?
28-10-2018T12:47:57,Twokinds,I heard there was a bit of a texture smudging issue on the ps4 pro
28-10-2018T12:48:16,Dadrobit,:/ playing on PS4Pro right now.
28-10-2018T12:48:18,Twokinds,Something about the way it filtered stuff.
28-10-2018T12:48:22,Twokinds,I dunno.
28-10-2018T12:48:27,Xexanoth,also loading issues
28-10-2018T12:48:44,Twokinds,I don't even have a tv that can do anything over 1080p
28-10-2018T12:49:26,Dadrobit,I splurged when I got a Pro version and got a 4k tv. It's like watching a cinema.
28-10-2018T12:54:02,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, I watched DigitalFoundry's video on the technical analysis of the different versions."
28-10-2018T12:54:28,TorqueEmUp,PS4 has issues with the checkerboard rendering fudging up the textures.
28-10-2018T12:54:40,Dadrobit,I'l have to take a gander then
28-10-2018T12:54:47,TorqueEmUp,PS4 Pro version I mean
28-10-2018T12:55:19,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, they compare Xbox One S, to Standard PS4, to PS4 Pro to the Xbox One X"
28-10-2018T12:55:58,TorqueEmUp,"Other than not reaching proper 4k, and the checkboard rendering, the PS4 Pro version ain't that bad."
28-10-2018T12:56:36,TorqueEmUp,But still runs way smoother on the X
28-10-2018T12:58:50,Dadrobit,"Yeah, for all the mechanical design issues I've had with the game, I can't say I've ever seen something (yet?) that makes me say ""Wow, that texture looks off."" So far it's been up there with The Witcher 3 and Horizon Zero Dawn on overall graphical present"
28-10-2018T12:58:53,Dadrobit,presentation
28-10-2018T12:59:03,TorqueEmUp,"I have both a Pro and an X, which is annoying because everyone jumped on the Playstation bandwagon, so for anything multiplayer I need to get the inferior PS4 version."
28-10-2018T13:00:03,TorqueEmUp,"Oh yeah, I was thoroughly amazed by Horizon Zero Dawn, still haven't seen anything that's impressed me to that scale."
28-10-2018T13:01:07,TorqueEmUp,That was on par with the very first time I booted up ES:Oblivion back in the day on 360 and walking out of the tutorial dungeon.
28-10-2018T13:01:37,TorqueEmUp,If you get what I mean
28-10-2018T13:02:08,Dadrobit,I do. Spent more than a few hours in that game
28-10-2018T13:02:20,TorqueEmUp,Hell Horizon looked friggin' amazing on a even a standard PS4.
28-10-2018T13:02:21,Xexanoth,ElderScrolls...on console....i feel sorry for you
28-10-2018T13:02:47,Dadrobit,"Ha, just got into the DF video and he just mentioned HZD"
28-10-2018T13:02:54,TorqueEmUp,"Then in the middle of playing it, I upgraded to the Pro, and it just knocked it out of the park."
28-10-2018T13:03:46,TorqueEmUp,"Don't be Xexa, I prefer Vanilla game experiences. Mods are for people who have too much time. :P"
28-10-2018T13:04:07,TorqueEmUp,There are too many games to play to be screwing around with mods in one game.
28-10-2018T13:05:08,Dadrobit,"Have Skyrim on both PS4 and PC. PS4 is comfy, but dang it I do wish I could bring Inigo with me..."
28-10-2018T13:05:57,TorqueEmUp,"I've always preferred modding Fallout, but that's just me."
28-10-2018T13:06:20,TorqueEmUp,I still prefer to play the game in its entirety first before screwing with mods.
28-10-2018T13:07:21,TorqueEmUp,"Never been a big ""fantasy"" guy, always preferred sci-fi, adn post apocalyptic settings."
28-10-2018T13:07:47,Dadrobit,"Got Platinum on Skyrim twice now, so I'm pretty comfortable in saying I've played Skyrim through its entirety lol."
28-10-2018T13:08:57,TorqueEmUp,"I played Skyrim on 360, and still is my most fleshed out save file, still haven't touched any DLC and ain't getting all the achievements because I missed some Daedric artifacts."
28-10-2018T13:09:14,TorqueEmUp,and don't feel like restarting just to get them.
28-10-2018T13:10:39,TorqueEmUp,"I have like, too many versions of Skyrim. lol"
28-10-2018T13:11:13,TorqueEmUp,"Have the Special Edition for PS4, and of course on PC."
28-10-2018T13:12:22,TorqueEmUp,Never play as anything other than Argonian. :P
28-10-2018T13:12:27,Xexanoth,i really meant more for menu accesability and bug fixing
28-10-2018T13:12:42,Dadrobit,"They're not bugs, they're featuers."
28-10-2018T13:12:45,Dadrobit,features*
28-10-2018T13:13:33,Dadrobit,Though the first release on PS3 was actually just terribad. Rimlag was the worst.
28-10-2018T13:14:37,TorqueEmUp,"If you really want to get down to it, the PS4, and Xbox One Special Editions have mod support, so they can have the unofficial bug patches, not that the game really needs em."
28-10-2018T13:16:04,TorqueEmUp,"Though Sony are dicks about mods and don't allow external assets to be added, while on Xbox mods can."
28-10-2018T13:16:46,Xexanoth,did they actually fix stuff in the speical editiopn? cause in the normal edition you really needed those patches. Then again SE was incompatible with the inventory mod so i never bothered with it
28-10-2018T13:16:52,Xexanoth,*special edition
28-10-2018T13:16:58,Xexanoth,"jeez, how did i massacre that so badly"
28-10-2018T13:17:23,TorqueEmUp,Honestly in the Normal edition I never had anything that I can recall that completely broke.
28-10-2018T13:17:46,TorqueEmUp,Nothing I really cared about anyway. lol
28-10-2018T13:17:51,Xexanoth,i had a bunch of broken questlines
28-10-2018T13:18:17,Xexanoth,my favourite was the broken final boss fight in dragon born DLC which was a pretty big deal
28-10-2018T13:18:26,TorqueEmUp,You kinda expect these things from Elder Scrolls games anyway.
28-10-2018T13:18:31,TorqueEmUp,lol
28-10-2018T13:19:05,Xexanoth,i expect to use unofficial patches to fix it....
28-10-2018T13:19:22,Xexanoth,"and also having a proper inventory, whi9ch skyrim somehow managed to fuck up"
28-10-2018T13:19:56,TorqueEmUp,It also helps to actually make lots and lots of saves.
28-10-2018T13:20:39,Xexanoth,"well, the dragonborn dlc bug basicially required you restart the entire DLC, and then you had to pray you don't get it again"
28-10-2018T13:21:08,Xexanoth,at least most of the time you'd actually get another story breaking bug earlier on instead
28-10-2018T13:21:09,TorqueEmUp,bummer
28-10-2018T13:21:39,TorqueEmUp,Fallout > Elderscrolls
28-10-2018T13:21:44,TorqueEmUp,nuff said. :P
28-10-2018T13:21:52,TorqueEmUp,granted that's comparing Apples to Oranges
28-10-2018T13:22:21,Xexanoth,"well, fallout 4 felt very elderscrolls...."
28-10-2018T13:22:33,Xexanoth,mostly due quest design
28-10-2018T13:23:31,Dadrobit,Player power scaling felt very off to me in FO4.
28-10-2018T13:23:57,TorqueEmUp,yeah
28-10-2018T13:24:21,Dadrobit,"The game for me felt like I was very feeble very early on, but then a bit later it just kinda switches and I felt like an ubergod."
28-10-2018T13:24:25,TorqueEmUp,"I cranked my difficulty up to the highest, then they patched in another higher difficulty that was completely ludicrous."
28-10-2018T13:24:40,Dadrobit,Not even taking Power Armor into account.
28-10-2018T13:24:42,Xexanoth,"that's because they used the ES type of ""infinite leveling"" vs the usual concentrated build with limited levels"
28-10-2018T13:25:03,Xexanoth,"or rather, infinite skills instead of levels"
28-10-2018T13:26:06,TorqueEmUp,"But yeah, on the difficulty I play FO4 at, I pretty much always have to use Power Armor."
28-10-2018T13:26:35,Xexanoth,"funnily enough, once you level really high FO4 became stupid because the enemys had so much health."
28-10-2018T13:27:05,Xexanoth,"""having enemy HP based on your level in a system with limited damage scaling is a smart idea"" - Bethesda"
28-10-2018T13:27:40,TorqueEmUp,"My only gripes with Fallout 4 are the crappy story, and lots of missing weapons from previous two fallout games, and special weapons no longer felt special when you found them."
28-10-2018T13:28:17,Xexanoth,"my biggest issue was the crafting system, while a neat idea in theory it basicially turned the game in garbage collctor 2000"
28-10-2018T13:28:28,TorqueEmUp,Since just about every enemy encounter you were picking up some weapon that had some kinda special ability.
28-10-2018T13:28:51,Xexanoth,half my gametime is probably just collecting stuff and bringing it back to my base so i can eventually craft useful stuff outta it
28-10-2018T13:29:00,Xexanoth,kinda broke the flow
28-10-2018T13:29:01,TorqueEmUp,Yeah I feel ya there too
28-10-2018T13:29:47,TorqueEmUp,"While neat at first, I didn't like how modular the guns were."
28-10-2018T13:30:03,TorqueEmUp,"how you could turn pistols into rifles, and vice versa."
28-10-2018T13:30:41,Dadrobit,"And it really just came down to ""pick the option at the bottom for numerically best performance"""
28-10-2018T13:30:53,TorqueEmUp,Also I want a fucking assault rifle that doesn't take up half my fucking screen.
28-10-2018T13:31:29,TorqueEmUp,"Where is my Fallout 3 assault rifle, and chinese assault rifles?"
28-10-2018T13:32:20,TorqueEmUp,10mm pistol doesn't look like Fallout's 10mm pistol from previous games.
28-10-2018T13:32:45,TorqueEmUp,No wattz laser pistol
28-10-2018T13:33:04,Xexanoth,"to be fair, consenstincy in looks pretty much only exist in FO3 and NV"
28-10-2018T13:35:10,TorqueEmUp,"Nah, Fallout 3 and NV borrowed carried over most of it's designs from the original fallout games, granted some things of course were added, and some are missing."
28-10-2018T13:35:22,TorqueEmUp,"But from New Vegas to 4, the weapon selection fell through the floor."
28-10-2018T13:35:45,TorqueEmUp,literally and figuratively :P
28-10-2018T13:37:09,TorqueEmUp,Also Sniper Rifles are a complete joke in FO4
28-10-2018T13:37:44,TorqueEmUp,like why is a .50 not blowing off a raider's head in one shot?
28-10-2018T13:38:20,TorqueEmUp,I was blowing off Deathclaw heads in 1 shot with a .50 in New Vegas.
28-10-2018T13:38:50,TorqueEmUp,*grumble grumble*
28-10-2018T13:39:17,Xexanoth,at least in FO4 energy weapons were feasible because of all the ammo drops from synths ^^
28-10-2018T13:39:51,TorqueEmUp,"Meh, they never gave you Gattling laser ammo."
28-10-2018T13:39:55,TorqueEmUp,like ever
28-10-2018T13:40:33,TorqueEmUp,"I have never once used it because I've never seen the ammo anywhere, not even in shops."
28-10-2018T13:40:57,Xexanoth,didn't the gatlin laser use those Power Armor cells?
28-10-2018T13:41:02,Xexanoth,or was that the gauss gun
28-10-2018T13:41:16,TorqueEmUp,neither I believe
28-10-2018T13:41:33,TorqueEmUp,"I dunno, I never looked to deeply into it"
28-10-2018T13:42:54,TorqueEmUp,"Also, they can fuck off, they changed the Gauss rifle design to whatever than monstrosity in 4 is."
28-10-2018T13:43:03,TorqueEmUp,Even if it's my most powerful weapon
28-10-2018T13:43:44,Xexanoth,"yep just looked it up, gatling laser used fusion cores"
28-10-2018T13:44:14,TorqueEmUp,Huh interesting
28-10-2018T13:44:59,TorqueEmUp,So I guess it just fires until it depletes the fusion core
28-10-2018T13:45:53,TorqueEmUp,"But still, I hate when they change up the weapon designs drastically."
28-10-2018T13:46:12,TorqueEmUp,"Fallout 3's Gauss rifle, to the Fallout 4 version."
28-10-2018T13:46:25,TorqueEmUp,Fallout 4 is fugly
28-10-2018T13:46:53,Xexanoth,"meh between the jump to 3d and then the Perk/Skill rework in 4, fallout changed so much that the weapon design really doesn't matter to me"
28-10-2018T13:48:59,TorqueEmUp,"I like my guns, and Fallout 4's gun selection is just awful."
28-10-2018T13:50:42,TorqueEmUp,"Give me New Vegas, but with Fallout 4 graphics engine. :P"
28-10-2018T13:50:57,TorqueEmUp,Or Fallout 3 with Fallout 4 graphics
28-10-2018T13:51:40,Twokinds,yes please
28-10-2018T13:52:41,Twokinds,Give me choices and skill checks back.
28-10-2018T13:53:17,TorqueEmUp,Yes!
28-10-2018T13:55:35,Dadrobit,"Beat Morrowind a few months back, makes me really yearn for deeper character customization."
28-10-2018T13:56:12,Xexanoth,Please Fallout 4 had skillchecks.....like 2 or 3 of em XD
28-10-2018T13:58:24,TorqueEmUp,I will say though Nuka World DLC was damn good
28-10-2018T13:58:51,Dadrobit,The weapon skill design made no damned sense in Skyrim. Using a dagger all game meant you were just as adept at using a club or katana 60 hours on. Compared to Morrowind that had like 6 different melee weapon skill routes.
28-10-2018T14:05:14,Twokinds,"In New Vegas, for example, there's a quest where cannibals ask for help, but only if you're evil, have high speech, or find clues. You can expose them, help them, find replacement meat, and unique dialogue if you're a cannabal too."
28-10-2018T14:05:21,Twokinds,There are multiple ways to fail and several alternate ways to succeed. I feel like this sort of thing was sorely lacking in Fallout 4.
28-10-2018T14:08:51,Twokinds,"Obviously a video game can't really capture all the possibilities like in D&D, but I appreciate it when they try."
28-10-2018T14:13:35,Dadrobit,That was the whole intention of the first few ES games. Down the the roll of the dice on weather or not you even hit the enemy even when they're right in front of you.
28-10-2018T14:13:49,Dadrobit,whether*
28-10-2018T14:18:43,Dadrobit,Oof. Had to reset my browser and lost all my open tabs. 189 of them. feelsbadman
28-10-2018T14:19:02,Twokinds,nooooo
28-10-2018T14:19:12,Twokinds,Although I can't imagine having that many tabs
28-10-2018T14:19:59,Dadrobit,"Mostly music, couple forum tabs, some Red Dead stuff."
28-10-2018T14:20:55,Twokinds,I start feeling bad when the tabs get so crowded they start to shrink
28-10-2018T14:21:00,Twokinds,Then I have to do some culling
28-10-2018T14:21:22,Dadrobit,That's why I use Firefox. Literally the only reason. I like seeing the tab names.
28-10-2018T14:24:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Dude I can barely handle seeing more than four tabs what’s wrong with you
28-10-2018T14:26:30,Dadrobit,I got 99 problems....
28-10-2018T14:26:40,Dadrobit,Well... More like 189 problems..
28-10-2018T14:30:35,SpazztasticKiwi,More like 190 cause you don’t seem to have the sense God gave a grasshopper
28-10-2018T14:31:05,SpazztasticKiwi,You can’t possibly have something going for each tab that requires them to all constantly be open
28-10-2018T14:32:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"What are they even for? You have one open for here, obviously, maybe two or three for your autopsy work, but the others...?"
28-10-2018T14:32:46,Dadrobit,"Not gonna lie. Used to be over 230 last night. Weant and closed a bunch to help get the browser running more smoothly. Had to actually exit out this morning and when I re-opened it, it refused to let me restore my last session."
28-10-2018T14:33:01,Dadrobit,Went*

28-10-2018T14:35:39,Dadrobit,"I built it myself, it'll do what I say."

28-10-2018T14:40:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Well it seems you got it under control. Just hope the robot revolution doesn’t come soon 🤖

28-10-2018T14:41:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Robits- baby robots
28-10-2018T14:42:10,Dadrobit,"And yeah, have a good one."
28-10-2018T14:44:32,Dadrobit,The only thing that concerns me is my phone's life. It doesn't even tell me how many tabs I have open anymore. The counter is just a smiley face.
28-10-2018T14:45:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,might be time to close some of those
28-10-2018T14:46:20,Dadrobit,Tabs... My Precious....
28-10-2018T14:47:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"on pc I can kinda understand all those tabs, but why so many on your phone?"
28-10-2018T14:48:59,Dadrobit,"""Oh, that link looks interesting! I need to remember to come back to that later!"" *opens in new tab*"
28-10-2018T14:49:04,Dadrobit,Same as I am on PC
28-10-2018T14:51:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Ah, that makes sense.  How often do you go back and check them out?"
28-10-2018T14:52:00,Dadrobit,Almost always. And if I don't do it immediately I'll look into it while I'm doing my bi-monthly purge.
28-10-2018T14:52:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,at least you don't do what I do and just open but never look at XD
28-10-2018T15:00:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,gotta go see ya
28-10-2018T15:01:07,Dadrobit,o/
28-10-2018T15:20:44,Bgrmystr2,lol people who use hundreds of tabs
28-10-2018T15:20:55,Bgrmystr2,te bane of any power user / IT
28-10-2018T15:22:04,Bgrmystr2,you literally have a user-friendly file system themed bookmark panel you can use that isn't even obstrusive and is very easy to use and sort..
28-10-2018T15:22:37,Bgrmystr2,and you can use the same logic on the windows file folder system on the bookmarks..
28-10-2018T15:22:39,Bgrmystr2,but NOPE
28-10-2018T15:23:03,Bgrmystr2,let's bog down our browser to use 8 to 12 GB of ram with 150 tabs..
28-10-2018T15:23:11,Bgrmystr2,and then complain later that it's slow :V
28-10-2018T15:24:50,Bgrmystr2,"I'm past the point of sad, angry, or confused, that people do this"
28-10-2018T15:25:09,Bgrmystr2,and at this point I'm just more genuinely impressed how the fuck any of them can function.
28-10-2018T15:25:53,Bgrmystr2,cuz god damn you must have the paitence of a saint and the expectations of speed similar to someone using windows 95
28-10-2018T15:46:12,Dadrobit,Currently at 406 bookmarks as well.
28-10-2018T15:46:46,Dadrobit,In Firefox. Dunno where I'm at in Chrome.

28-10-2018T17:42:49,Twokinds,I miss home cooked food.
28-10-2018T17:44:33,SpazztasticKiwi,..aren’t you at home?
28-10-2018T17:45:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"Like, home cooked food is literally a room or something away"
28-10-2018T17:48:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Make some 🥞
28-10-2018T17:49:03,Twokinds,...Most of my food comes from cans.
28-10-2018T17:49:23,Twokinds,Does a microwaved can of soup count as home cooked?
28-10-2018T17:54:24,Dadrobit,Home re-heated
28-10-2018T17:54:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Heating something is cooking. You’re re-exciting the molecules

28-10-2018T17:56:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"And jeez, just soup? You’re exciting aren’t you"
28-10-2018T17:57:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Try some chicken pot pie or something now and then
28-10-2018T17:57:39,Dadrobit,"No lie, I just had canned chicken pot pie the other day"
28-10-2018T17:57:54,SpazztasticKiwi,CaNnEd?!
28-10-2018T17:58:18,Dadrobit,It was a soup.
28-10-2018T17:58:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Thank God thought you were talking about a full chicken pot pie in a soup abomination
28-10-2018T17:59:14,SpazztasticKiwi,*in a can
28-10-2018T17:59:47,Dadrobit,"Nah, it was Campells or something like that. ""Rich and Hearty"" stuff."
28-10-2018T17:59:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe I’m more used to homemade pot pie or those microwaveable mini pies or something
28-10-2018T18:00:04,unsteddyphoenix,Canned chicken? How futuristic

28-10-2018T18:01:09,Dadrobit,Even I enjoy quick and easy sometimes.
28-10-2018T18:01:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh I could say something mean but
28-10-2018T18:02:21,Dadrobit,"C'mon, that was a gimme."
28-10-2018T18:02:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok fine - that’s what your ex told me about you as warning
28-10-2018T18:03:56,Dadrobit,"Pffft, my last ex left me mid-coitus for making a Skyrim joke. I'm sure she'd say plenty of shit about me lmfao."
28-10-2018T18:05:28,unsteddyphoenix,You got a great story out of it though
28-10-2018T18:06:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Buddy I was told yesterday that my ex is living on his own a city over
28-10-2018T18:06:21,Dadrobit,"Heheheheh, yeah I did."
28-10-2018T18:06:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I was like “fascinating”
28-10-2018T18:06:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Apparently it’s been three years and he’s not changed a lick
28-10-2018T18:07:16,unsteddyphoenix,Relatable
28-10-2018T18:08:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"His cousin that swings by now and then seems to think I’ve changed though. Which is kind of a given, I’d say"
28-10-2018T18:11:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Sometimes I wonder what it says that some of my exs’ families still talk to me and they don’t
28-10-2018T18:19:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"Anyhoo, I must return to my hub. Just 3 more hours till im done 👋🏻"
28-10-2018T18:33:52,Dadrobit,"I don't always agree with Jim Sterling, but he's seeming to hit on the same problems as I with RDR2's cumbersome mechanics that prioritize ""realism"" over player convenience."

28-10-2018T21:48:19,RimaDraws,its pretty bad ass
28-10-2018T21:48:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I had laundry
28-10-2018T21:48:25,SpazztasticKiwi,And a church thing
28-10-2018T21:48:28,CrRAR,Yeah!
28-10-2018T21:48:31,Ordithus,People seemed to like it
28-10-2018T21:48:36,RimaDraws,i adored it
28-10-2018T21:48:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I thought it’d be cute
28-10-2018T21:48:44,Dadrobit,It was very well done.
28-10-2018T21:48:48,RimaDraws,very cute
28-10-2018T21:48:53,Ordithus,It wound up spooooky
28-10-2018T21:48:58,SpazztasticKiwi,And Tom may actually like it as a Halloween thing
28-10-2018T21:49:04,RimaDraws,honestly i just love spooky things
28-10-2018T21:49:06,Ordithus,Heeeeere's Sythe!!!!
28-10-2018T21:49:17,SpazztasticKiwi,The freedom to make it creepy or cheesy
28-10-2018T21:49:48,CrRAR,Nibbly was the true hellspawn.
28-10-2018T21:49:56,RimaDraws,just anything tom draws is an inspiration to me and how my art has evolved. i just didn't wanna sound like a total creepo
28-10-2018T21:50:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Hey at least you didn’t introduce yourself with “I follow your brother and that’s how I found you”
28-10-2018T21:50:54,RimaDraws,i found tom through my bf crimson
28-10-2018T21:51:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause that’s restraining order material there
28-10-2018T21:51:04,RimaDraws,he was the one who got me into twokinds
28-10-2018T21:51:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Found Tom through Mark. And his “my brother Thomas has a webcomic called TwoKinds; I’ll link it in the description.”
28-10-2018T21:51:59,CrRAR,lol
28-10-2018T21:52:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I swear I went like a year without knowing Tom existed - thought Mark was an only child
28-10-2018T21:52:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Then I learned there was a sane one first
28-10-2018T21:52:53,RimaDraws,i know i just don't know how to say it without sounding weird. i just enjoy his work its just appealing to me
28-10-2018T21:52:57,Ordithus,"""sane"""
28-10-2018T21:53:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom hasn’t taken a bath in mashed potatoes
28-10-2018T21:53:45,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-katdryer:
28-10-2018T21:53:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Or hot cocoa
28-10-2018T21:53:49,Ordithus,That we know of
28-10-2018T21:53:53,SpazztasticKiwi,As far as I know
28-10-2018T21:53:54,Ordithus,We don't know what he do
28-10-2018T21:53:57,RimaDraws,lol
28-10-2018T21:54:17,RimaDraws,anyway ill stop my creepy talk lol *goes to hide*
28-10-2018T21:54:18,SpazztasticKiwi,And I’m not sure I’d like to learn if he did or does
28-10-2018T21:54:49,Ordithus,"Rima, I don't think any of that was creepy."
28-10-2018T21:55:16,Ordithus,"""Hey, I like your art"" isn't creepy"
28-10-2018T21:55:17,CrRAR,It's all for the sake of ART.
28-10-2018T21:55:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"You want to talk obsessional talk, get me started on Jason Voorheese or Thomas Sanders"
28-10-2018T21:55:54,RimaDraws,i just wouldn't have enjoyed two kinds without my bf getting me into it
28-10-2018T21:57:07,CrRAR,Must make for some fun discussions.
28-10-2018T21:57:22,RimaDraws,oh we have quite a few of them
28-10-2018T21:57:34,CrRAR,#teamreni vs #teamnora

28-10-2018T22:01:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m watching the stream with the Nibbly & Sythe sketch
28-10-2018T22:01:26,CrRAR,Are you horrified?
28-10-2018T22:01:27,RimaDraws,like i said its bad ass
28-10-2018T22:01:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Says it was suggested by some Jordan person
28-10-2018T22:01:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Not me
28-10-2018T22:01:36,Ordithus,wat
28-10-2018T22:01:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Someone stole my suggestion
28-10-2018T22:02:03,CrRAR,"Oh yeah, that was a surprise."
28-10-2018T22:02:24,RimaDraws,were you the one with the grim reaper nibbly and her sythe
28-10-2018T22:02:42,RimaDraws,because we thought it was strange that it was altered me and torque
28-10-2018T22:02:54,CrRAR,"Welcome to twokinds, where the art is awesome and the suggestions only kinda matter."
28-10-2018T22:03:13,Ordithus,There was another piece yesterday that had two suggestors
28-10-2018T22:03:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"That’s exactly how I worded it, yeah"
28-10-2018T22:03:21,Ordithus,Maybe you inspired this Jordan?
28-10-2018T22:03:26,CrRAR,(Tom would probably be happy to add you)
28-10-2018T22:03:40,RimaDraws,it was mine and another user that had the same one about rose
28-10-2018T22:03:47,RimaDraws,i was glad to share it with someone else
28-10-2018T22:03:49,Ordithus,Oh yeah
28-10-2018T22:04:10,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s not inspiration if he saw my phrasing and decided to put it up himself
28-10-2018T22:04:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"Or herself, whichever"
28-10-2018T22:04:27,Ordithus,I do distinctly remember you coming up with the idea in this chat
28-10-2018T22:04:38,Ordithus,Or at least first mentioning it
28-10-2018T22:04:50,CrRAR,"I knew you had mentioned it before, so, yeah, you have that going fer ya."
28-10-2018T22:04:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I tossed it up as an idea to y’all one late night cause I thought it was cute
28-10-2018T22:05:29,SpazztasticKiwi,And then I decided why not try it as a suggestion since it’s a play on words and near Halloween
28-10-2018T22:05:50,RimaDraws,i think it was a great suggestion
28-10-2018T22:06:01,RimaDraws,i would keep trying with more sythe and nibbly
28-10-2018T22:06:07,Ordithus,Terrifyingly adorable pun

28-10-2018T22:11:08,Dadrobit,Pops is coming over to hijack my booth. He's getting hooked on making videos for his classes to work with.
28-10-2018T22:11:10,CrRAR,(Sooo metal)

28-10-2018T22:14:35,CrRAR,That's admirable
28-10-2018T22:16:53,Dadrobit,"It's nice. Maybe 15-30 mintes of work after he's done saying his lines, then he spends all night trying to fit them properly into a powerpoint video."
28-10-2018T22:17:29,Dadrobit,minutes*
28-10-2018T22:17:56,CrRAR,Haha
28-10-2018T22:19:55,CrRAR,How precious
28-10-2018T22:22:31,Dadrobit,End product is primo though. I've taken a couple online classes in college and his stuff blows theirs out of the water.
28-10-2018T22:23:06,Dadrobit,"Dude makes custom animations for everything, and of course the audio is from an actual microphone lol."

28-10-2018T22:38:19,RimaDraws,lol
28-10-2018T22:38:39,Ordithus,Are you saying we should spam Kat butt?

28-10-2018T22:40:31,RimaDraws,drawing her tattoo on her is hard
28-10-2018T22:40:33,RimaDraws,><
28-10-2018T22:56:51,Twokinds,I would fear designing a character with a tattoo knowing that I'd have to draw it all the time.
28-10-2018T22:58:02,Twokinds,Flora's fur pattern is bad enough.
28-10-2018T22:58:12,RimaDraws,she's almost done ^^
28-10-2018T22:58:17,RimaDraws,im just finishing the highlights
28-10-2018T22:58:28,RimaDraws,yea ive drawn flora before
28-10-2018T22:58:34,RimaDraws,her stripes are hard to draw
28-10-2018T23:00:12,unsteddyphoenix,Yes I learnt that when I tried to draw flora
28-10-2018T23:00:16,unsteddyphoenix,Stripes? Hard.
28-10-2018T23:00:32,unsteddyphoenix,Lot easier on 3D characters like Maya
28-10-2018T23:00:42,RimaDraws,maya? not really i wish i could show this to you
28-10-2018T23:00:58,unsteddyphoenix,You cant?

28-10-2018T23:01:04,RimaDraws,i could
28-10-2018T23:01:20,unsteddyphoenix,:thinking: ?
28-10-2018T23:02:05,RimaDraws,well i wouldn't know how since this is a patron post. other than putting it in stash on DA
28-10-2018T23:02:32,unsteddyphoenix,"Ohh, is your patreon paywalled?"
28-10-2018T23:02:44,RimaDraws,yes it is
28-10-2018T23:03:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Heya Tom
28-10-2018T23:03:17,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, that's fine if you dont want to. Though for the record you could upload it on a site like imgur"
28-10-2018T23:03:54,RimaDraws,i don't use imgur
28-10-2018T23:04:12,RimaDraws,like i said i can put it in stash on DA and link if thats alright with mods here
28-10-2018T23:04:35,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah that's fine
28-10-2018T23:04:46,Ordithus,"Or is it?  Yes, yes it is"
28-10-2018T23:05:02,RimaDraws,yea last time i linked during stream it was removed so im being careful
28-10-2018T23:05:14,Ordithus,That's Sage's rule

28-10-2018T23:06:05,unsteddyphoenix,Just pray to sage quickly before every link

28-10-2018T23:07:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Though Tom - did you see any of the conversation before about the sketches
28-10-2018T23:08:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"Rima, do you use Twitter or Tumblr for any of your art?"
28-10-2018T23:08:10,RimaDraws,i do use twitter
28-10-2018T23:08:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Think you’d try posting it to your followers there if you wanted to get it to them?
28-10-2018T23:08:48,RimaDraws,i do post there
28-10-2018T23:08:54,SpazztasticKiwi,O
28-10-2018T23:09:13,RimaDraws,if you want it its @RimaDraws
28-10-2018T23:09:17,RimaDraws,like mine here
28-10-2018T23:09:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I ask cause art theft happens on some platforms more than others
28-10-2018T23:09:51,SpazztasticKiwi,So some try keeping their stuff on strictly one or two
28-10-2018T23:10:24,RimaDraws,well my patreon stuff goes on twitter and patreon only usually
28-10-2018T23:10:29,RimaDraws,sometimes fb page too

28-10-2018T23:26:36,Dadrobit,"Nah, this is my element."
28-10-2018T23:26:38,unsteddyphoenix,You replied to someone from them on twitter
28-10-2018T23:26:45,unsteddyphoenix,Actually I dont know how twitter works
28-10-2018T23:26:50,unsteddyphoenix,But I think so
28-10-2018T23:27:20,RimaDraws,me either lol
28-10-2018T23:28:01,unsteddyphoenix,Do you have any digital colouring tutorials you'd recommend?
28-10-2018T23:28:09,unsteddyphoenix,At some point I need to do that again
28-10-2018T23:28:23,RimaDraws,i don't really follow tutorials. tom has been my inspiration to color and shade better
28-10-2018T23:28:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m pretty sure I suggested it first and they put it up as a mimic card
28-10-2018T23:28:43,SpazztasticKiwi,+1 chance for draw
28-10-2018T23:28:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Your lottery chances have increased
28-10-2018T23:29:25,unsteddyphoenix,Alas
28-10-2018T23:29:54,Ordithus,From 1 in a billion to... 2 in a billion
28-10-2018T23:30:04,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah that's happened to me before too lol
28-10-2018T23:30:25,RimaDraws,i mean he mentioned somewhat about how to shade. i go by cel shading and try to do my best. the overlay is just for better colors to pop out
28-10-2018T23:30:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Now we need a cute version with Nibbly with a tiny pumpkin candy bucket and Sythe off to the side smiling like the proudest papa
28-10-2018T23:31:03,RimaDraws,ive done some TK art but idk lol.
28-10-2018T23:31:07,RimaDraws,i still need practice on that
28-10-2018T23:31:24,Twokinds,Yeah multiple people suggesting the same thing happens quite a bit
28-10-2018T23:31:27,Twokinds,I don't mind it
28-10-2018T23:31:28,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I guess I just need to actually practise
28-10-2018T23:31:47,Twokinds,It's nice being able to get 2 or more people's suggestions at once
28-10-2018T23:32:03,RimaDraws,i mean i practice everyday after work while at the same time doing commissions. its a learning experience
28-10-2018T23:32:03,Ordithus,Kill 2 patrons with one sketch
28-10-2018T23:32:06,unsteddyphoenix,Very convinient!
28-10-2018T23:32:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I just wonder if they thought they were helping promote it or just straight up stealing it
