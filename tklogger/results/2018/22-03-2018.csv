22-03-2018T00:00:00,TheBeckoner,Tesla coupe my guy
22-03-2018T00:00:04,TheBeckoner,wait
22-03-2018T00:00:07,TheBeckoner,Roadster*
22-03-2018T00:00:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Nm - the X requires more money
22-03-2018T00:00:34,unsteddyphoenix,CANYONERO
22-03-2018T00:00:37,TheBeckoner,yeah but
22-03-2018T00:00:49,TheBeckoner,0-60 in 1.8 seconds is key
22-03-2018T00:00:57,Vatruvius,Pillow Natani(like Pillow Flora/Kat)...obviously she is rather upset and tries to cover herself the best she can.
22-03-2018T00:01:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"Problem with those this is that they’re fancy, pretty, and fast, but you get in a wreck and you’ll look like a crushed coke can"
22-03-2018T00:01:48,unsteddyphoenix,Meh. It's already been done.
22-03-2018T00:01:54,TheBeckoner,My concern would be breaking all the little batteries...
22-03-2018T00:02:26,TheBeckoner,So expensive to replace
22-03-2018T00:02:47,unsteddyphoenix,"I could see it winning a vote just 'cause it's Natani, but it's not very interesting to me personally."
22-03-2018T00:03:15,Vatruvius,I thought it would be kinda funny...but to each their own.
22-03-2018T00:03:58,Vatruvius,I mean...this Therie/Daniels train has been going on...it is a little much no?
22-03-2018T00:04:43,unsteddyphoenix,The solution to something repetitive isnt a repeat of something different lol.
22-03-2018T00:04:55,unsteddyphoenix,"Again though, thats just me."
22-03-2018T00:05:06,SpazztasticKiwi,People like their sexy times
22-03-2018T00:05:33,unsteddyphoenix,Focus on what you want over what you think will win.
22-03-2018T00:05:41,SpazztasticKiwi,How often have we seen Kat lately
22-03-2018T00:05:50,Vatruvius,"I was not trying to create a solution for what is going on, I just thought this sketch would be a nice addition because there is already a Kat and Flora one."
22-03-2018T00:05:51,TheBeckoner,I'd probably vote for something else Vat. If im being honest
22-03-2018T00:06:44,Vatruvius,"This is why I am running ideas by you guys, not enough time spent with the sketch suggestion to see which one is worth a submition."
22-03-2018T00:07:00,unsteddyphoenix,"Not enough, Kiwi."
22-03-2018T00:07:32,unsteddyphoenix,Especially since she was cruelly excluded in the comic atm~
22-03-2018T00:08:12,TheBeckoner,Is it only cruel because she is part cat Phoenix? lol
22-03-2018T00:08:16,Vatruvius,She disappeared along with Eric at the estate.
22-03-2018T00:08:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe Tom can just draw a random bowl of fruit. Just to confuse everyone
22-03-2018T00:08:47,Vatruvius,lol
22-03-2018T00:08:52,TheBeckoner,No that
22-03-2018T00:08:56,TheBeckoner,now that*
22-03-2018T00:08:59,TheBeckoner,I would vote for
22-03-2018T00:09:02,Vatruvius,"I would assume he does, but does Tom have a day job?"
22-03-2018T00:09:23,unsteddyphoenix,It's cruel because she wouldve probably enjoyed the experience and she deserves to be happy :T
22-03-2018T00:09:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I think anybody knows if he does or not
22-03-2018T00:09:39,unsteddyphoenix,The comic is his day job
22-03-2018T00:09:43,TheBeckoner,&gt;No happiness for cat-dogs
22-03-2018T00:09:55,unsteddyphoenix,Instead the pregnant lady goes seems safe.
22-03-2018T00:10:06,Bigboi182,Is Tom even awake?
22-03-2018T00:10:13,TheBeckoner,Probably
22-03-2018T00:10:16,Bigboi182,"I doubt it, but still..."
22-03-2018T00:10:41,SpazztasticKiwi,He may just have the chat open while he draws
22-03-2018T00:10:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Just to lurk
22-03-2018T00:10:55,Vatruvius,I need to think of a sketch idea that has a story to it...I can see why Tom wants to make sure the pages are right. This takes a lot of thinking and time!
22-03-2018T00:11:00,Bigboi182,"Not like he has time to stay up this late, he's gotta stream tomorrow."
22-03-2018T00:11:34,SpazztasticKiwi,12 am ain’t late
22-03-2018T00:11:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"Or 1, to him"
22-03-2018T00:11:59,Bigboi182,"Come to think of it, I would like to see a drawing of Tom, up late at night drawing, with text that says, ""This is REAL dedication."""
22-03-2018T00:12:10,Vatruvius,nice
22-03-2018T00:12:28,Vatruvius,A sketch of Tom sketching a sketch of Tom...
22-03-2018T00:12:44,Bigboi182,TOMCEPTION
22-03-2018T00:12:47,Bigboi182,BWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
22-03-2018T00:12:54,Bgrmystr2,Tom's already sketched himself
22-03-2018T00:12:56,Bgrmystr2,several times.
22-03-2018T00:12:56,Vatruvius,OMG...LOL
22-03-2018T00:13:04,Vatruvius,He has.
22-03-2018T00:13:08,SpazztasticKiwi,TOMSKETCHPTION
22-03-2018T00:13:13,Bgrmystr2,"in fact, he did one just recently too"
22-03-2018T00:13:19,Bgrmystr2,so I mean..
22-03-2018T00:13:22,Vatruvius,Did he?
22-03-2018T00:13:26,Vatruvius,Which one?
22-03-2018T00:13:26,Bgrmystr2,yeah he did
22-03-2018T00:13:47,Bgrmystr2,the nora card w/ the characters hanging out in the break room
22-03-2018T00:13:50,Bgrmystr2,"like Raine, Laura, etc"
22-03-2018T00:13:51,SpazztasticKiwi,you’re face.. I like that
22-03-2018T00:14:08,Bgrmystr2,I don't think he's finished that one yet
22-03-2018T00:14:10,Vatruvius,Hmm...
22-03-2018T00:14:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Can I wear it
22-03-2018T00:14:20,Vatruvius,"I was about to say, I never saw that one."
22-03-2018T00:14:34,Vatruvius,No...I want to keep my face Kiwi.
22-03-2018T00:15:22,Bgrmystr2,you can't wear my face if I am face.
22-03-2018T00:15:32,Bgrmystr2,that would require you to wear more than just my face.
22-03-2018T00:15:48,Bgrmystr2,"and at that point, you're just asking to be miserable."
22-03-2018T00:15:49,SpazztasticKiwi,In English?
22-03-2018T00:16:05,Bgrmystr2,"it is English, Kiwi."
22-03-2018T00:16:13,Bgrmystr2,"you said ""You are face.."""
22-03-2018T00:16:19,Bgrmystr2,"or ""You're face"""
22-03-2018T00:16:30,Bgrmystr2,and then wanted to wear said face.
22-03-2018T00:16:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Fine
22-03-2018T00:16:53,Bgrmystr2,Just sayin.. it's kind of a tough ask.
22-03-2018T00:16:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Your face. I like that shit
22-03-2018T00:17:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Can I wear it
22-03-2018T00:17:20,Bgrmystr2,oooooooh :ptv-wondering:
22-03-2018T00:17:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Great way to get a creep to leave you alone
22-03-2018T00:17:33,Bgrmystr2,"and naw, wearing my face would also make you miserable."
22-03-2018T00:17:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Or at least think again about talking to you
22-03-2018T00:17:45,Bigboi182,"Y'know, because it was Momiplier's birthday a while ago, maybe he should just draw her."
22-03-2018T00:18:00,SpazztasticKiwi,That would go over well
22-03-2018T00:18:13,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: Seems kind of out of the box, big. not sure why Tom would draw her lol"
22-03-2018T00:18:14,Bigboi182,"Nothing fancy or anything, just a simple and elegant drawing for her belated birthday."
22-03-2018T00:18:25,Vatruvius,That just makes me think of those sacrifices done in South America where the priests skinned those for sacrifice then wore their skin...
22-03-2018T00:18:26,Bgrmystr2,I'm sure he already got her something
22-03-2018T00:18:47,SpazztasticKiwi,She may not like celebrating her birthday
22-03-2018T00:19:01,Bigboi182,"I mean, that's what I would do for my mom if I could draw."
22-03-2018T00:19:26,Bigboi182,He doesn't even have to upload it to patreon if he doesn't want to.
22-03-2018T00:19:32,Bigboi182,It's up to him.
22-03-2018T00:20:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe he’s done something for her already and just hasn’t mentioned it
22-03-2018T00:20:52,Bgrmystr2,you guys do realize that everything already happened right?
22-03-2018T00:21:01,Bgrmystr2,why are you talkin about it like it hasn't happened yet lol
22-03-2018T00:21:22,Vatruvius,"No offense, but if I were to draw my mom and I never really drew anything outside popular comics/my own comic, I would not mention my drawing of my mom neither would I upload it. Personal space..."
22-03-2018T00:21:37,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s why I said he’s probably already done something - like maybe they went out to dinner
22-03-2018T00:21:58,SpazztasticKiwi,He doesn’t seem to keen on drawing family
22-03-2018T00:22:03,Vatruvius,Most...generic...birthday...gift
22-03-2018T00:22:06,Bgrmystr2,"considering he didn't get to do comic prep on tues because it was her bday, you can probably guess they did something."
22-03-2018T00:22:17,Bgrmystr2,it's a given
22-03-2018T00:22:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Dinner’s not generic. I’d rather have a dinner & conversation than a necklace or whatever
22-03-2018T00:23:05,Bgrmystr2,"dinner is as generic as you get, kiwi"
22-03-2018T00:23:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Then call me Great Value
22-03-2018T00:23:46,Bgrmystr2,GreatValueKiwi
22-03-2018T00:23:52,unsteddyphoenix,generic doesnt mean bad.
22-03-2018T00:23:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not hard to please or entertain
22-03-2018T00:24:17,Bgrmystr2,"at this rate, I'm gonna start thinking you live near phoenix on an island in the middle of nowhere"
22-03-2018T00:24:34,Bgrmystr2,UPSIDE DOWN EVEN
22-03-2018T00:24:41,Bgrmystr2,because we all know they live upside down
22-03-2018T00:24:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"Yep. I’m on the south end, he’s on the north"
22-03-2018T00:24:51,Bgrmystr2,Knew it.
22-03-2018T00:25:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though if that were the case, he’d have trekked over here to see my cats"
22-03-2018T00:26:22,SpazztasticKiwi,What’s your birthday present then if a dinner out is too lame
22-03-2018T00:26:38,Bigboi182,Maybe a helicopter ride?
22-03-2018T00:26:44,Bigboi182,IDK.
22-03-2018T00:26:44,unsteddyphoenix,skydiving
22-03-2018T00:27:02,Bigboi182,Driving an F1 Car?
22-03-2018T00:27:08,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s a no on both fronts for me. Heights an I don’t mix
22-03-2018T00:27:52,unsteddyphoenix,dont see whats wrong with a dinner out though
22-03-2018T00:28:06,Vatruvius,"I mean, a dinner is nice but I would do much more. I would actually have a movie day + home made dinner + home made cake/pie/dessert."
22-03-2018T00:28:32,SpazztasticKiwi,That sounds great too. Food fight in the kitchen
22-03-2018T00:28:36,unsteddyphoenix,Its the thought that counts not how much work it takes.
22-03-2018T00:29:19,Vatruvius,Yup...I just like to make my mom feel special. :ptv-hearts:
22-03-2018T00:29:26,Bgrmystr2,even simple things can be nice. Doesn't mean they aren't generic. But those generic things can please lots of people.
22-03-2018T00:30:12,Bigboi182,"As long as you appreciate your mother, that's fine enough."
22-03-2018T00:30:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Family celebrating birthday with you? Day out of activity
22-03-2018T00:31:00,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, I enjoy just kicking back and doing nothing really. Have a few friends over, bullshit for a few hours"
22-03-2018T00:31:01,Bigboi182,"It shouldn't even just be on their birthday, it should be everyday, with their birthday adding in something extra."
22-03-2018T00:31:06,Bgrmystr2,"do nothing, really"
22-03-2018T00:31:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"Partner birthday? Dinner & movie or stay in, cook, throw cake batter at each other"
22-03-2018T00:31:14,Bgrmystr2,that's really my ideal birthday
22-03-2018T00:31:35,unsteddyphoenix,same
22-03-2018T00:31:50,Vatruvius,Your ideal birthday is throwing cake batter @Bgrmystr2? :P
22-03-2018T00:31:58,Bgrmystr2,No?
22-03-2018T00:32:00,unsteddyphoenix,Wasteful of cake tho :O
22-03-2018T00:32:03,Bgrmystr2,I said what my ideal birthday is
22-03-2018T00:32:18,Bgrmystr2,but I guess noone was reading :U
22-03-2018T00:32:32,Bgrmystr2,"it's ok, I'll just cross you guys off the list :v"
22-03-2018T00:32:40,Bgrmystr2,ez fix
22-03-2018T00:32:41,Vatruvius,I was making fun your the timing of your message.
22-03-2018T00:32:46,unsteddyphoenix,the list of nothing?
22-03-2018T00:32:52,Bgrmystr2,and now it's even more nothing
22-03-2018T00:32:55,Bgrmystr2,:D
22-03-2018T00:33:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"Food fights are fun. And if it’s with your partner, clean up’s more fun"
22-03-2018T00:33:15,Bgrmystr2,cleaning is not fun
22-03-2018T00:33:24,Bgrmystr2,ever
22-03-2018T00:33:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"Or sit at home with yourself and watch whatever you want with as much pizza, I’ve, cream, and take out you want"
22-03-2018T00:33:57,SpazztasticKiwi,And pants aren’t required
22-03-2018T00:34:14,SpazztasticKiwi,*ice cream
22-03-2018T00:34:16,Bgrmystr2,"literally just.. that kiwi.. but hold the pizza, ice cream, and take out"
22-03-2018T00:34:30,Bgrmystr2,just hold the sitting at home and watching whatever
22-03-2018T00:34:32,Bgrmystr2,just.. that
22-03-2018T00:34:33,Bgrmystr2,by itself
22-03-2018T00:34:36,Bgrmystr2,that's nice.
22-03-2018T00:34:42,unsteddyphoenix,also no pants
22-03-2018T00:35:01,Bgrmystr2,Pants will be whatever I wore the day before.
22-03-2018T00:35:08,Bgrmystr2,:u
22-03-2018T00:35:32,Vatruvius,"That sounds like a sketch idea, Kat gets into a cake batter fight with Eric only to be rejected again."
22-03-2018T00:35:40,Bigboi182,yep
22-03-2018T00:35:51,Bigboi182,suggest it.
22-03-2018T00:35:54,SpazztasticKiwi,She just throws the entire bowl at his head
22-03-2018T00:35:56,Vatruvius,Will do.
22-03-2018T00:36:01,unsteddyphoenix,Poor...poor Kat...:ctwokinds-LauraCry:
22-03-2018T00:36:01,SpazztasticKiwi,“Love me dammit”
22-03-2018T00:36:14,Vatruvius,I will let Tom decided Kat's reaction.
22-03-2018T00:36:18,unsteddyphoenix,Its so sad lol
22-03-2018T00:36:32,Vatruvius,That gif gets me every time!
22-03-2018T00:36:38,Bigboi182,Things like that make me wanna slap Eric y'know
22-03-2018T00:36:48,unsteddyphoenix,I really hope she doesnt go back with Eric.
22-03-2018T00:36:53,Vatruvius,I want to do more than slap him!
22-03-2018T00:36:55,TheBeckoner,Most of my birthdays are just with friends shootin the shit and sitting around
22-03-2018T00:36:58,unsteddyphoenix,I dont think she will but she might
22-03-2018T00:37:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Some guys just can’t tell the chick’s flirting with them
22-03-2018T00:37:23,Bigboi182,what else could you do to Eric?
22-03-2018T00:37:33,Vatruvius,"That tends to happen when the guy does not see them that way, they just think they are friends when really she wants more."
22-03-2018T00:37:41,Dadrobit,"Eric's not that naieve ya know. The dude admits that they ""foled around"" earlier in their relationship. He's just not into her that way."
22-03-2018T00:37:47,Dadrobit,fooled*
22-03-2018T00:37:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Wrap him up in a rug and toss him into a four lane highway at rush hour
22-03-2018T00:38:10,Dadrobit,naive*
22-03-2018T00:38:17,Vatruvius,No...he gets wraping in a rug and run over by a bunch of horses like in Marco Polo
22-03-2018T00:38:23,Vatruvius,wrapped*
22-03-2018T00:38:39,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I kind of suspect that Eric always knew
22-03-2018T00:38:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Or has a feeling
22-03-2018T00:39:05,unsteddyphoenix,"And just has no interest, and made it clear with the ""sister"" thing"
22-03-2018T00:39:17,SpazztasticKiwi,“Maybe it’ll just fade”
22-03-2018T00:39:19,Bigboi182,"Meanwhile, he flirts with the ones who AREN'T interested in him, without noticing the one who gives a damn."
22-03-2018T00:39:23,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah
22-03-2018T00:39:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Poor Kat
22-03-2018T00:39:40,unsteddyphoenix,Poor dear sweet precious Kat...
22-03-2018T00:39:55,Bigboi182,"For those who say Kat is lusty, they may be right..."
22-03-2018T00:39:57,Dadrobit,"The dude breeds keidran and has ""other"" servants. He knows."
22-03-2018T00:40:14,Bigboi182,But they're also WRONG.
22-03-2018T00:40:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Well look who emerges from the shadows
22-03-2018T00:40:38,Dadrobit,Me?
22-03-2018T00:40:44,unsteddyphoenix,Not like he can force himself to see her in that way though.
22-03-2018T00:40:49,Vatruvius,"I do think he really cares about Kat like a brother would, but if that was the extent of it then they would not have ""fooled around."""
22-03-2018T00:41:05,Bigboi182,"Kat wants a mate, Eric doesn't care. Classic Yandere-ish story."
22-03-2018T00:41:05,Dadrobit,"Yup, Erics just a trash character."
22-03-2018T00:41:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Yes you. Only decided to pop in a minute ago

22-03-2018T11:23:33,qwe304,"was going to be wed. then moved to thurs. then somthing came up, no new day set. however he normally streams today anyway"
22-03-2018T11:34:26,SykezWolf,Aww okay. Thank you
22-03-2018T11:52:42,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
22-03-2018T13:17:58,PalmettoPathfinder1,So just saw that there was no comic stream last night.  Well maybe third time's the charm I guess
22-03-2018T13:23:00,Vatruvius,"I am not sure about a page stream, but I would assume we are still planning on some type of stream today."
22-03-2018T13:25:53,Bgrmystr2,Fridays are a given
22-03-2018T13:26:10,Bgrmystr2,so are Sundays
22-03-2018T13:38:25,Vatruvius,"So what are we thinking, page or color stream?"
22-03-2018T13:40:47,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: If he finishes the page, then it'll be that. If not, then probably nora cards or something. Drawing the page never seems to be the problem"
22-03-2018T13:41:07,Bgrmystr2,it's the story behind it that seems to cause so much delay
22-03-2018T13:55:59,Vatruvius,"I figured, creating a really good story and dialogue on top of that is difficult. One you have it though you know what to draw."
22-03-2018T13:56:09,Vatruvius,Once*

22-03-2018T21:04:04,Combak,Or the sketch streams.

22-03-2018T21:59:17,Ordithus,"Links OK if to Tom or Sage's stuff directly, I think."
22-03-2018T21:59:24,Vatruvius,Not allowed in the merge streams?
22-03-2018T21:59:26,Bgrmystr2,"Sage is the host of the multi, Vatru, meaning his rules apply"
22-03-2018T21:59:27,ZahnHolley,Too much reading gives sage a headache XD
22-03-2018T21:59:28,Ordithus,At least I've been getting away with it since forever.
22-03-2018T21:59:41,MetalAppleSauce,"We haven't seen ""old euchre"" since 272 or whenever it was"
22-03-2018T21:59:43,BluePhantom90,BTW Tom arn't you kinda doing the Color stream a little early?
22-03-2018T21:59:47,unsteddyphoenix,"Huh, that would actually be interesting...If Natanis and Zens connection works inside the mansion"
22-03-2018T21:59:48,SageSaga,Stream Rules!  General Rule - Ask first. Want to post a link? Check with me or another mod/streamer first.
22-03-2018T21:59:50,MetalAppleSauce,let alone coloured at all
22-03-2018T21:59:50,SageSaga,"No promotions. Streamers in multi-streams can promote themselves and their works and things they want, but viewers should not promote anything without permission."
22-03-2018T21:59:53,unsteddyphoenix,Then it makes sense
22-03-2018T22:00:02,SageSaga,and finally - Don't be rude.
22-03-2018T22:00:17,Bgrmystr2,"how do you figure, Blue?"

22-03-2018T22:45:25,BluePhantom90,I alreay am guessing both teams will be staying at Trace's Mansion for a while. Since Flora is pregnant and everyone would want to sleep on nice beds
22-03-2018T22:45:25,Ordithus,"Don't forget Evals, y'all"
22-03-2018T22:45:37,unsteddyphoenix,He's a dog
22-03-2018T22:45:38,MuonNeutrino,"@ProsePro7 well, given the geography of the comic world, it doesn't look to me like there actually are any human-inhabited lands at low enough latitudes that it'd make sense to have dark-skinned humans, so it might actually make sense"
22-03-2018T22:45:39,unsteddyphoenix,You racist
22-03-2018T22:45:40,BluePhantom90,I'm Already

22-03-2018T22:46:18,MatyMaty,I wonder how humanized Remi looks like
22-03-2018T22:46:18,ZRO4825,"Actually, I believe you are backwards there, Cheese. Mike is the fox. Evals is the dog."
22-03-2018T22:46:26,MetalAppleSauce,inb4 brahn blows the place to pieces

22-03-2018T22:47:56,Vatruvius,It sucks that you can only give one suggestion but can you imagine if you could give more then one. We would never be able to vote for them all.
22-03-2018T22:48:04,TheFDdriver,12%
22-03-2018T22:48:11,Ordithus,Sage will go until stupid wee hours in the morning

22-03-2018T22:48:27,MuonNeutrino,"@CheeseRS highly variable, but usually several hours at least"
22-03-2018T22:48:37,CheeseRS,Just FIFO

22-03-2018T22:49:03,Vatruvius,What I meant was that we would not be able to get through all the suggestions. Each vote will be like that mega vote we had last sketch stream.
22-03-2018T22:49:16,Ordithus,Are Raine and Maren... holding hands?!
