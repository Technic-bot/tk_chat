23-08-2018T00:01:01,Bgrmystr2,the kitchen not even separated from the dining room.. the bathtub is just.. man xD
23-08-2018T00:01:11,Bgrmystr2,haven't seen a bathtub like that in years
23-08-2018T00:01:12,Ordithus,"Hmm... I'm not looking for a big, fancy house.  $$$ and all.  Yeah, the tub isn't my favorite."
23-08-2018T00:01:23,Bgrmystr2,the bed too
23-08-2018T00:01:31,Bgrmystr2,I know it prolly doesn't come with the house but

23-08-2018T00:02:11,Bgrmystr2,"srsly.. If I didn't know better, This new Sims game got wayyyyyyyyy better graphics than I expected."
23-08-2018T00:02:19,Twokinds,I just want a house with a secret room behind a bookcase. Is tha ttoo much to ask?
23-08-2018T00:02:24,SpazztasticKiwi,yes

23-08-2018T00:02:32,SpazztasticKiwi,We only have bat caves
23-08-2018T00:02:33,Bgrmystr2,not* even
23-08-2018T00:02:46,Bgrmystr2,"at least you have caves, kiwi"
23-08-2018T00:02:51,Bgrmystr2,we can't even go underground..
23-08-2018T00:02:52,Ordithus,One letter and the meaning changes completely
23-08-2018T00:02:54,Bgrmystr2,ti's all water
23-08-2018T00:03:22,Ordithus,One house in the listings here has a vault...
23-08-2018T00:03:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"Seriously though, my cousin‚Äôs house had an underground, bat-cave like level"
23-08-2018T00:03:42,SpazztasticKiwi,It fed into the garage
23-08-2018T00:04:22,SpazztasticKiwi,It was real rual too. But it had a horse pasture so not many people were interested
23-08-2018T00:05:00,Bgrmystr2,I don't even know what kind of house I want to live in..
23-08-2018T00:05:12,SpazztasticKiwi,One with a roof?
23-08-2018T00:05:19,Ordithus,Approximately four walls?
23-08-2018T00:05:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe a window?
23-08-2018T00:05:28,Ordithus,Or at least
23-08-2018T00:05:37,Ordithus,A door to get in
23-08-2018T00:05:47,Ordithus,That doesn't disappear
23-08-2018T00:05:58,Bgrmystr2,"for a while, I wanted to get two mobile homes and rig them to join together side by side to make a mobile house"
23-08-2018T00:06:15,Bgrmystr2,and make something really crazy cool
23-08-2018T00:06:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Plenty of those around here
23-08-2018T00:06:36,Bgrmystr2,most mobile homes are pretty garbage though
23-08-2018T00:06:38,Twokinds,I wouldn't trust a house with a vault
23-08-2018T00:06:42,Bgrmystr2,"they're nice, but small"
23-08-2018T00:06:51,Ordithus,"Smart, Tom"
23-08-2018T00:06:54,Twokinds,I just know I'd lock myself inside it somehow.
23-08-2018T00:07:18,Ordithus,"Was it meant to keep people out, or something inside"
23-08-2018T00:07:29,Bgrmystr2,so you don't trust yourself.. when you fully realize you are your own greatest treasure?

23-08-2018T00:08:31,Bgrmystr2,got a 502 error on that
23-08-2018T00:08:39,Ordithus,I can see it
23-08-2018T00:08:58,Ordithus,"Around here, that would get you a shed.  Or a crackhouse"
23-08-2018T00:09:09,Bgrmystr2,the exiting picarto page is what gave the error
23-08-2018T00:09:25,Ordithus,You can never leave

23-08-2018T00:11:11,Bgrmystr2,gawd damn that 1.2 million dollar home..
23-08-2018T00:11:16,Bgrmystr2,I don't think I even want to live there
23-08-2018T00:12:35,Twokinds,"If I had 1.2 million dollars, I certainly wouldn't spend it on a house."
23-08-2018T00:12:49,Ordithus,What would you spend it on?
23-08-2018T00:12:54,Ordithus,Ice cream?
23-08-2018T00:13:05,Bgrmystr2,Lifetime supply of ice cream..
23-08-2018T00:13:12,Twokinds,Buying more money

23-08-2018T00:13:56,Twokinds,Investment account over 30 years at 5-7% interest
23-08-2018T00:14:11,Bgrmystr2,that won't make you a billionaire though
23-08-2018T00:14:36,unsteddyphoenix,Buy gold!
23-08-2018T00:14:42,unsteddyphoenix,Gold is almost money
23-08-2018T00:14:44,Bgrmystr2,gotta invest half of it into stock.. then pay someone to make the other stocks drop in value..
23-08-2018T00:14:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"Cheapest place here is $23,000"
23-08-2018T00:15:25,unsteddyphoenix,Houses can be that cheap?
23-08-2018T00:15:31,Bgrmystr2,yes
23-08-2018T00:15:35,Ordithus,Actually similar here.  But... oh god.  Oh god oh god oh god :ptv-grossedout:

23-08-2018T03:59:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I listened to a little music a minute ago
23-08-2018T04:00:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve seen that listening to your favorite song before bed can help you sleep and help you sleep better

23-08-2018T13:58:59,totallynotTrace,sometimes it is
23-08-2018T13:59:05,totallynotTrace,it varies
23-08-2018T13:59:12,CrimsonQuill,Time zones suck.
23-08-2018T13:59:27,CrimsonQuill,I'm in the uk-ireland time zone-5 hours behind US time.
23-08-2018T13:59:40,totallynotTrace,on days leading up to the stream it tends to be a bit busier

23-08-2018T14:00:16,CrimsonQuill,WHat country?
23-08-2018T14:00:18,totallynotTrace,east coast us
23-08-2018T14:00:20,CrimsonQuill,ok.
23-08-2018T14:00:36,CrimsonQuill,What sketch suggestion did you make last week?
23-08-2018T14:01:19,totallynotTrace,me personaly? im not a paid patron so i couldnt also i was busy so i couldnt watch the stream live or vote
23-08-2018T14:01:37,CrimsonQuill,I tried a suggestion for Spartan Raine for the second time in a row.
23-08-2018T14:01:49,CrimsonQuill,"It failed again, but I'll keep trying it."
23-08-2018T14:02:15,CrimsonQuill,I haven't had any luck with any of my suggestions so far.
23-08-2018T14:02:33,totallynotTrace,i dont think that will get voted for. spartan Natani or Adalade maybe
23-08-2018T14:02:44,CrimsonQuill,Why not Raine?
23-08-2018T14:03:35,totallynotTrace,"her body isnt the ""fighter"" type"
23-08-2018T14:03:50,CrimsonQuill,She'd be covered in Mjolnir armour.
23-08-2018T14:04:05,CrimsonQuill,That's 7 foot tall power armour from the Halo universe.
23-08-2018T14:04:17,totallynotTrace,oh that spartan
23-08-2018T14:04:30,CrimsonQuill,"The sort of stuff the Master Chief wears, as opposed to the Greek Spartans."
23-08-2018T14:05:15,totallynotTrace,idk i havnt seen many halo suggestions get through
23-08-2018T14:05:49,CrimsonQuill,That's a pity. I tried a Twokinds fireteam a a bit earlier-that never took off either.
23-08-2018T14:06:09,CrimsonQuill,And UNSC AI Flora-imagine her meeting Cortana or Isabel.
23-08-2018T14:07:53,totallynotTrace,I remember Tom did a thing on Tech Flora (not sure what its actually labled) where shes floating and has a bunch of holographic screens around her. looked cool
23-08-2018T14:08:32,CrimsonQuill,I liked that one too.
23-08-2018T14:09:04,CrimsonQuill,"That's Kinda what I had in mind, except she would be the hologram, with electrical symbols all over her."
23-08-2018T14:09:13,CrimsonQuill,"And a nice, bright orange!"
23-08-2018T14:09:48,totallynotTrace,that could work
23-08-2018T14:10:29,CrimsonQuill,"It didn't, but I might try it again."
23-08-2018T14:11:17,CrimsonQuill,"I also want to put in a pic involving Good/Evil Trace as two entities-Good Trace as a Jedi, Evil Trace as a Sith with a Crossguard Light Saber."
23-08-2018T14:11:48,totallynotTrace,"anyway if your unsure of when the stream starts, 9 pm is in about 6 hours"
23-08-2018T14:11:57,totallynotTrace,that also sounds cool
23-08-2018T14:12:02,totallynotTrace,i have to go
23-08-2018T14:12:09,CrimsonQuill,I know when it starts anyhow.
23-08-2018T14:12:16,CrimsonQuill,Take care! Cheerio!
23-08-2018T14:53:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel Bagheera missed the memo when it was determined cats were graceful. He just fell off the bed again
23-08-2018T15:32:55,Twokinds,Just having breakgast and it's 4:30pm
23-08-2018T15:39:54,SpazztasticKiwi,What‚Äôs breakgast? You might be hungrier than you think
23-08-2018T15:40:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, breakfast happens when you wake up. It‚Äôs the first meal of the day. And time doesn‚Äôt exist."
23-08-2018T15:53:22,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds It's 9:40pm over here as I type. I've never had breakfast at 4:30 tough. I'd think of that as Afternoon Tea.
23-08-2018T15:57:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Good tea is boiling hot and at least 3x as strong as the serving suggestion. And no sugar!
23-08-2018T15:58:00,CrimsonQuill,@SpazztasticKiwi Preferabky Earl Grey.
23-08-2018T15:58:21,CrimsonQuill,Twinings tea for quality.
23-08-2018T15:58:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Yes I still have taste buds. It‚Äôs also almost 4 here and I‚Äôve yet to convince myself to actually get up for food
23-08-2018T15:58:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"I do green, and pretty much only üçµ"
23-08-2018T15:58:42,CrimsonQuill,I was up at 6:00 My time for morning chores.
23-08-2018T15:58:52,CrimsonQuill,"Letting the animals out, for example."
23-08-2018T15:59:15,SpazztasticKiwi,One reason I have cats. They care for themselves for the most part
23-08-2018T15:59:22,CrimsonQuill,I love cats.
23-08-2018T16:00:03,CrimsonQuill,"To quote Terry Pratchett's Discworld Death, when asked what there is in life worth living for, 'Cats. Cats are nice.'"
23-08-2018T16:00:19,CrimsonQuill,I have to let out the ducks and geese.
23-08-2018T16:00:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Ducks are nice. Geese are a bit dickish
23-08-2018T16:01:04,CrimsonQuill,I personally adore Geese.
23-08-2018T16:01:25,CrimsonQuill,Except the african goose in the French zoo that chased me when I was seven.
23-08-2018T16:01:29,CrimsonQuill,Not that goose.
23-08-2018T16:01:33,CrimsonQuill,Other geese are fine.
23-08-2018T16:01:39,SpazztasticKiwi,You don‚Äôt mess with geese
23-08-2018T16:02:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt even approach geese if I see them
23-08-2018T16:02:22,CrimsonQuill,"Ours are generally alright. When they're laying, however, collecting eggs involves a number of pecks along the arm."
23-08-2018T16:02:34,CrimsonQuill,They do peck hard.
23-08-2018T16:04:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Geese have teeth
23-08-2018T16:04:33,CrimsonQuill,I know.
23-08-2018T16:05:11,CrimsonQuill,I like 'em anyway.
23-08-2018T16:15:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I prefer a cat
23-08-2018T16:15:29,CrimsonQuill,CATS.
23-08-2018T16:15:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Or big fluffy dog
23-08-2018T16:15:35,CrimsonQuill,We have three dogs.
23-08-2018T16:16:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Not av
23-08-2018T16:16:35,SpazztasticKiwi,*not a fan of the small ones
23-08-2018T16:16:53,CrimsonQuill,"Two big, one small"
23-08-2018T16:18:27,CrimsonQuill,Is it sketch or colour stream this weekend?

23-08-2018T16:20:48,CrimsonQuill,Which ones d'you think'll get through?
23-08-2018T16:21:12,CrimsonQuill,Personally I'd like to see Maeve and Maddie included.
23-08-2018T16:21:20,CrimsonQuill,At Dinner.
23-08-2018T16:21:25,CrimsonQuill,Nuzzle.
23-08-2018T16:22:34,SpazztasticKiwi,May very well make it
23-08-2018T16:22:53,CrimsonQuill,"I'm going for now. I might be back, though."
23-08-2018T16:23:04,SpazztasticKiwi,K
23-08-2018T16:23:04,CrimsonQuill,I plan on staying up VERY late.
23-08-2018T16:23:24,CrimsonQuill,Goodbye for now!
23-08-2018T16:28:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve decided peaches are my lunch
23-08-2018T16:32:48,Bgrmystr2,just woke up after a fairly restless night
23-08-2018T16:33:00,Bgrmystr2,don't feel so bad anymore honestly :ptv-wondering:
23-08-2018T16:37:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I woke up in the middle of the night like I had a stomach virus
23-08-2018T16:38:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Don‚Äôt know what I had to make me so nauseous but I turned up the fan and evidently went back to sleep
23-08-2018T16:39:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Course that was after our musical discussion

23-08-2018T18:57:16,Twokinds,"I'm so sorry, Dadrobit"
23-08-2018T18:57:19,CrimsonQuill,"@Twokinds Tom, do you have any idea what's going on?"

23-08-2018T19:51:36,HobbitGames,I really have to make an icon for this account.......
23-08-2018T19:51:54,HobbitGames,Haha. Good umm..... whats the word?
23-08-2018T19:52:03,HobbitGames,Analogy!
23-08-2018T19:52:22,Combak,plays the Jeopardy tune.
23-08-2018T19:52:48,HobbitGames,Ive never seen that show. I have seen some clips of it though. Seems rather confusing
23-08-2018T19:53:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I like family feud better
23-08-2018T19:53:27,HobbitGames,Over here its family fortunes. Unless thats a different show
23-08-2018T19:53:35,Bgrmystr2,Jeopardy isn't actually confusiung
23-08-2018T19:53:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I don‚Äôt watch but a few shows at all anyway. Not big on alot of tv
23-08-2018T19:53:46,HobbitGames,I love tv
23-08-2018T19:53:47,Bgrmystr2,you just have to watch it to understand it
23-08-2018T19:54:03,HobbitGames,Theres no proper Irish game shows.
23-08-2018T19:54:21,HobbitGames,The only one is some thing done by the National Lottery
23-08-2018T19:54:39,SpazztasticKiwi,We used to play jeopardy in school. Had a teacher who‚Äôd pull it out as the day‚Äôs ‚Äúlesson‚Äù
23-08-2018T19:54:39,HobbitGames,And everybody is guaranteed to get money
23-08-2018T19:55:15,HobbitGames,The only game ive ever played in school is Diplomacy in History class
23-08-2018T19:55:19,HobbitGames,Great game
23-08-2018T19:55:24,HobbitGames,Should het back into it
23-08-2018T19:56:09,CommanderTrace,is there a discord?
23-08-2018T19:56:15,HobbitGames,No official one
23-08-2018T19:56:17,CrRAR,yay for diplomacy \o/
23-08-2018T19:56:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I like history things that tell you what was going on ~here~ as well as the place ~over there~
23-08-2018T19:56:25,CrRAR,yay for skool \o/
23-08-2018T19:56:36,HobbitGames,Like HOI4?
23-08-2018T19:56:47,HobbitGames,CRRAR. YOU MONSTER
23-08-2018T19:56:48,CommanderTrace,can someone send the link?
23-08-2018T19:57:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Like apparently Edgar Allan Poe and Abe Lincoln were friends in their 20s
23-08-2018T19:57:05,HobbitGames,There is no official discord chanbel
23-08-2018T19:57:36,CrRAR,Explains why Abe had such a way with words~
23-08-2018T19:58:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚ÄúI speak with a poet, so I know their language‚Äù"
23-08-2018T19:58:11,HobbitGames,"I dont know if any of you have heard this, but apparently, according to some scources, JFK......... WAS ASSASSINATED!"
23-08-2018T19:58:28,CrRAR,four score and slavery nevermore!
23-08-2018T19:58:34,CrRAR,*crowd cheers*
23-08-2018T19:58:51,HobbitGames,How long is a score again? 12 years?
23-08-2018T19:59:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"Quite a few important, impressive people were assassinated"
23-08-2018T19:59:05,HobbitGames,No. Cant be that long
23-08-2018T19:59:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Google it
23-08-2018T19:59:30,HobbitGames,Julius caesar was potentially the moat important assassination in history
23-08-2018T20:00:02,Combak,MLK Jr? Kennedy?
23-08-2018T20:00:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I did a paper on Martin Luther. He helped the women‚Äôs movement
23-08-2018T20:00:18,CrRAR,Anytime you too harshly piss off one side of a particular argument.
23-08-2018T20:00:34,CrRAR,"Sadly, all issues have two sides."
23-08-2018T20:00:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Some have more
23-08-2018T20:01:00,CrRAR,true
23-08-2018T20:01:14,HobbitGames,"I understand where you are going, but if Julius Caesar wasnt assassinated, we would be looking at a dramatically changed wprld. JFK and MLK Jr. Were too recent to have major impacts."
23-08-2018T20:01:15,CrRAR,M U L T I F A C E T E D
23-08-2018T20:01:42,SpazztasticKiwi,And the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm right‚Äù concept doesn‚Äôt help
23-08-2018T20:01:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Nor does the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not changing my mind‚Äù thing
23-08-2018T20:02:03,CrRAR,lol
23-08-2018T20:02:12,HobbitGames,Thats why i hate flat earthers.
23-08-2018T20:02:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Otherwise known as ‚Äústubbornness‚Äù
23-08-2018T20:02:22,HobbitGames,They refuse to listen to science
23-08-2018T20:02:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"Or ‚Äústupidity‚Äù, as it seems"
23-08-2018T20:02:36,HobbitGames,Haha
23-08-2018T20:03:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember coming across quite a bit of stupid in high school
23-08-2018T20:03:05,SpazztasticKiwi,And still now
23-08-2018T20:03:45,CrRAR,It's scary thinking all that high school stupid is now freeeee~
23-08-2018T20:03:55,HobbitGames,Did you ever have any demonic teachers who wpuld give out for the smallest things?
23-08-2018T20:04:22,BadFoMo,Sage is live.
23-08-2018T20:04:22,Bgrmystr2,"unfortunately, stupid is not something you grow out of"
23-08-2018T20:04:31,Bgrmystr2,it's something you learn to not be :/
23-08-2018T20:04:33,HobbitGames,I had a teacher who once gave a referral (a reaaly really bad note) to a boy for smiling
23-08-2018T20:04:52,SpazztasticKiwi,We had a substitute teacher that we all swear heard voices. She shhhhhed the class when there was no noise
23-08-2018T20:04:54,Combak,Maybe we should let Darwinism take charge...

23-08-2018T23:10:07,Bgrmystr2,how do you like the grey? It's so boring
23-08-2018T23:10:07,SageSaga,that's my opinion
23-08-2018T23:10:08,unsteddyphoenix,agree with sage
23-08-2018T23:10:08,CrRAR,this is def a bit fruity for where Natani is at now xD
23-08-2018T23:10:11,Ordithus,The color is quite subjective
23-08-2018T23:10:19,RimaDraws,dark purple

23-08-2018T23:11:46,RimaDraws,dark purple is hot on her
23-08-2018T23:11:46,SageSaga,the Grey is more gender neutral and professional which fits with the dress shirt style
23-08-2018T23:11:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Dark purple is best

23-08-2018T23:54:07,RimaDraws,DAD hey
23-08-2018T23:54:37,TheBeckoner,hello Robit
23-08-2018T23:54:45,Dadrobit,"Fuckin' sucks mate. But it is what it is. Brother came over. We played some pinball and watched the rain for a while. He was the one who gifted her to me, so he was hit pretty hard as well."
23-08-2018T23:54:59,CrRAR,awww
23-08-2018T23:55:00,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all.
23-08-2018T23:55:41,Dadrobit,But thanks kindly for the concern.
23-08-2018T23:56:15,unsteddyphoenix,Such an awful thing to happen
23-08-2018T23:56:54,Twokinds,"As much as I complain about Holly sometimes, it scares me to think of her just going like that."
23-08-2018T23:57:00,Twokinds,I'm really sorry.
23-08-2018T23:57:11,unsteddyphoenix,"When mine died I was devastated, but at least we knew it was coming..."
23-08-2018T23:57:20,Dadrobit,I sincerely hope you have the longest time ever with Holly.
23-08-2018T23:58:10,RimaDraws,wait what happened dad?
23-08-2018T23:58:13,unsteddyphoenix,I feel for you man. :(
23-08-2018T23:58:19,Dadrobit,"Nyx was abandoned in a box with a few other kittens at the fire station my brother was volunteering at, so we had no idea what her health history could have been."
23-08-2018T23:58:40,Ordithus,Sorry about your cat.  Nyx was cool
23-08-2018T23:59:15,SageSaga,"my pets can never die, they are sexy women on pillowcases"
23-08-2018T23:59:41,Dadrobit,So the vet postulated that maybe she came from a bad breeding house or something and just had a heart defect that simply cropped up as a result later on since she was otherwise totally healthy/vaccinated/on heartworm prevention.
23-08-2018T23:59:59,3gress,"Hi guys, first time here."
