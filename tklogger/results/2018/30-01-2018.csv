30-01-2018T14:41:28,wolfspartan1,"i also like the ""dreaded dress question"""
30-01-2018T14:42:22,TheBeckoner,"Was Flora in a dress edited recently? I don't seem to remember the  ""Mrah!"" I just wanna make sure Im not going crazy."
30-01-2018T14:42:33,TheBeckoner,"Orif I am, atleast I know lol"
30-01-2018T14:44:04,wolfspartan1,"i didn't notice the ""mrah"""
30-01-2018T14:49:26,Twokinds,"No, it was always there."
30-01-2018T14:51:07,TheBeckoner,Guess I just didn't see it. Oh whale.
30-01-2018T14:58:16,wolfspartan1,don't feel bad i didn't see it too
30-01-2018T15:05:00,iliar,"My bot downloaded this art as soon as it became available (maybe 5-10 seconds delay). ""Mrah"" was there from beginning."
30-01-2018T15:13:12,TheBeckoner,"Yeah, Im sure I just didn't see it for some reason. No biggie."
30-01-2018T15:13:33,TheBeckoner,Thanks for letting me know though. I guess the bot catches everything?
30-01-2018T15:19:35,iliar,"Bot catches all public art at the time of publication. Bot does not see ""patrons only"" posts. Bot does not see post changes after publication."
30-01-2018T15:20:21,TheBeckoner,It only operates in Picarto correct?
30-01-2018T15:22:48,iliar,Arts are published on Patreon
30-01-2018T15:24:15,iliar,Bot catches arts on Patreon too
30-01-2018T15:24:39,TheBeckoner,Oh ok. That's pretty cool. You coded it yourself?
30-01-2018T15:25:21,iliar,Yes.
30-01-2018T15:25:40,Azumachan,Bot.
30-01-2018T15:25:46,Azumachan,This statement is false.
30-01-2018T15:27:08,iliar,Whats you mean?
30-01-2018T15:27:26,Azumachan,It's a paradox.
30-01-2018T15:27:50,Azumachan,It's a quote from Portal 2.
30-01-2018T15:29:31,iliar,I'm not a bot. Logical paradoxes on work for me.
30-01-2018T15:30:10,iliar,Trust me. I'm not liar.
