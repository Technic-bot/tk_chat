23-10-2018T12:59:18,Twokinds,Hello all
23-10-2018T12:59:55,iliar,"Hi, Tom. How are you?"

23-10-2018T13:10:17,iliar,Did you read my email about 15th Anniversary art?

23-10-2018T13:13:46,SpazztasticKiwi,...and good bye again. Tis work o‚Äôclock
23-10-2018T13:22:01,ElvenHunter84,"Is there going to be a makeup stream this week, or is it an all Tom Pick week?"
23-10-2018T13:34:11,Twokinds,Yes

23-10-2018T15:00:20,Twokinds,What costume should Karen be wearing?
23-10-2018T15:06:02,TerraTheWizard,bedsheet ghost :ptv-kippi2:
23-10-2018T15:06:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,cheap werewolf mask
23-10-2018T15:08:30,Foxpie,a badly home made eldritch horror costume
23-10-2018T15:10:02,Xexanoth,I'm with bedsheet ghost XD
23-10-2018T15:10:24,Xexanoth,no slutty halloween costume's here
23-10-2018T15:18:28,Mippy,May I third ‚Äúbedsheet ghost‚Äù of someone else is not already wearing it
23-10-2018T15:29:58,Dadrobit,"Well. She has the ears already, maybe give her a strap on muzzle so she can go as a ""scary keidran""?"
23-10-2018T15:30:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,cardboard tub snoot?
23-10-2018T15:30:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,tube even
23-10-2018T15:38:13,Dadrobit,That's what I was thinking. Something ridiculously low budget.
23-10-2018T15:38:25,SpazztasticKiwi,She can go as a pun costume
23-10-2018T15:38:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,that could be pretty cute
23-10-2018T15:38:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Then you can make it so everyone‚Äôs glaring at her
23-10-2018T15:38:47,SpazztasticKiwi,As she‚Äôs explaining it

23-10-2018T15:39:15,Dadrobit,"If she doesn't spend a lot on it, it would certainly be a low-cost-ume."
23-10-2018T15:40:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I was thinking more like her having a bunch of characters‚Äô name tags on her and being an ‚Äúidentity thief‚Äù
23-10-2018T15:42:00,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
23-10-2018T15:42:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Wait
23-10-2018T15:42:10,Dadrobit,"I did something like that a few Haloweens ago helping take some nieces and nephews trick or treating. I wasn't wearing anything,"
23-10-2018T15:42:24,Dadrobit,"and when folks would ask me why I wasn't dressed as anything, I just took out my wallet with my security badge in it and told folks that i was an undercover cop"
23-10-2018T15:42:28,SpazztasticKiwi,She could also dress as an ear of corn with a dog mask
23-10-2018T15:42:33,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúCorn dog‚Äù
23-10-2018T15:43:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Or a bunch of numbers on her as ‚Äúsomeone you can count on‚Äù
23-10-2018T15:43:55,Dadrobit,"Boy, that identity thief one is old as sin, been a while. Recall a kid doing that back when i was in junior high."
23-10-2018T15:44:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Or in a fancy dress and sash that says ‚Äúsorry‚Äù: as a ‚Äúformal apology‚Äù
23-10-2018T15:45:04,SpazztasticKiwi,One I think she‚Äôd fit well is if she was dressed in streamers and party horns with a hat and sign saying ‚Äúlife‚Äù: as ‚Äúthe life of the party‚Äù
23-10-2018T15:52:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Safe to say that should be enough ideas. I‚Äôll be bach later
23-10-2018T16:30:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I return to a graveyard I see

23-10-2018T20:40:41,ElvenHunter84,I really should have suggested Dead Keith for Tom Pick week
23-10-2018T20:41:02,ElvenHunter84,It has a much lower chance of being voted for than the MikexEvals one I suggested
23-10-2018T20:50:42,CrRAR,"Dead Keith? As in ""undead""?"
23-10-2018T20:51:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,thriller part 2?
