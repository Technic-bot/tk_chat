30-12-2017T17:22:28,Glassan,Now we just need the ever important *fake* enchanted mistletoe.
30-12-2017T17:22:44,Ossem1,hopefully zens not holding it
30-12-2017T17:22:55,Glassan,xD
30-12-2017T17:22:57,Aviark,Wouldn't want people to think they were actually in love
30-12-2017T17:23:01,Bgrmystr2,"Lol Glassan, or IS it? :P"
30-12-2017T17:23:11,Combak,wonders about the next enchanted mistletoe accident.
30-12-2017T17:23:29,Glassan,I think they locked it in a box after the last 'butt' incident.
30-12-2017T17:23:32,Ossem1,it does seem like its going to be a tradition now
30-12-2017T17:23:40,ZizzoGaming,I do believe the enchanted mistletoe is above Natani and Keith
30-12-2017T17:23:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I have a idea but gotta wait for next year tho
30-12-2017T17:23:58,Bgrmystr2,"that was the actual enchanted one, glassan."
30-12-2017T17:23:58,Glassan,"Besides, At this point, I'm pretty sure Nat would be flipping Zen off because the enchanted mistletoe isn't needed."
30-12-2017T17:23:59,Combak,"Nah, Flora brought it back for a kiss with Trace last year... or the year before that."
30-12-2017T17:24:09,Bgrmystr2,pretty sure there's a fake one and a real one :v
30-12-2017T17:24:23,Combak,Or she could be flipping Zen off for something he said.
30-12-2017T17:24:30,Bgrmystr2,or just.. because she can.
30-12-2017T17:24:30,Glassan,"Bgr, I remember."
30-12-2017T17:24:38,Bgrmystr2,because it's Zen.

30-12-2017T17:53:02,CrRAR,lol
30-12-2017T17:53:07,PalmettoPathfinder1,Thank you!  Oh snap!  Mine won again!  This is three times this year mine have been drawn (and two that have been colored)!

30-12-2017T17:53:46,CrimsonHelsing,I'm very disappointed not even Raine won really. Wtf guys?
30-12-2017T17:53:56,CrRAR,Right!?
30-12-2017T17:54:01,CrRAR,It had Zen
30-12-2017T17:54:01,MuonNeutrino,"well, raine's in the background of one of em"
30-12-2017T17:54:03,CrRAR,lol
30-12-2017T17:54:05,Bgrmystr2,"Raine is in #4, what are you smoking, Crimson?"
30-12-2017T17:54:11,Bgrmystr2,She's right there.
30-12-2017T17:54:17,CrRAR,yeah
30-12-2017T17:54:19,MuonNeutrino,would have swapped #2 for the skating one personally but v0v
30-12-2017T17:54:25,FlorenceandRafferty,Well that's that
30-12-2017T17:54:33,CrimsonHelsing,You guys can't be those damn millennials that only like more of the stagnating same xP
30-12-2017T17:54:44,CrRAR,uh huh uh huh
30-12-2017T17:54:50,Bgrmystr2,I didn't even vote
30-12-2017T17:54:57,Bgrmystr2,"I'm not a patron, I can't."
30-12-2017T17:54:58,PalmettoPathfinder1,I'm actually surprised that the one where Keith slept with Nat and Adelaide won.
30-12-2017T17:55:01,Bgrmystr2,So don't blame me
30-12-2017T17:55:18,CrimsonHelsing,"If that's the case, that's absolutely pathetic"
30-12-2017T17:55:26,CrRAR,The diplomacy one though is :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
30-12-2017T17:55:27,Combak,It's hot and funny Palmetto. Easy win.
30-12-2017T17:55:35,CrimsonHelsing,And I'm not blaming those that didn't vote
30-12-2017T17:56:07,TorqueEmUp,no bump in the bedsheet? :P
30-12-2017T17:56:10,Bgrmystr2,"This one is #2, and just cuz you don't like the results doesn't mean you speak for the majority, Crimson"
30-12-2017T17:56:28,TorqueEmUp,blanket
30-12-2017T17:56:30,Bgrmystr2,tis why there is a vote.
30-12-2017T17:56:34,MuonNeutrino,"honestly i'm a bit surprised how much support this one got as well, it's very far-out there"
30-12-2017T17:56:40,ZizzoGaming,"Sorry, I voted for Ice Skating #1, Male Female Mike #2, and the Keith + Natani under the mistletoe #3"
30-12-2017T17:56:40,CrimsonHelsing,"Eh, still, I'm not liking more of the same."
30-12-2017T17:56:56,FlorenceandRafferty,.
30-12-2017T17:57:03,Combak,"Eh, quite your whining."

30-12-2017T17:59:11,ZizzoGaming,Of course you did Marv.
30-12-2017T17:59:13,CrimsonHelsing,I also voted Maddie and Maeve
30-12-2017T17:59:19,RandomTKLover,That’s against the rules
30-12-2017T17:59:22,TorqueEmUp,"and it still didn't win, what a shame Marv"
30-12-2017T17:59:25,TorqueEmUp,:P
30-12-2017T17:59:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I said before if I could rig I would
30-12-2017T17:59:43,RandomTKLover,All trump supporters
30-12-2017T17:59:47,TheVileOne,ice skating was a tom choice so it was never really a popular idea to begin with
30-12-2017T17:59:53,CrimsonHelsing,Who could say no to Maeve? I mean really xP
30-12-2017T18:00:29,Combak,Good point VileOne.
30-12-2017T18:00:48,ZizzoGaming,Shut your mouth VileOne!
30-12-2017T18:00:59,CrimsonHelsing,"At least I got cash for one Nora Card this year, hopefully. Just my luck this Christmas."
30-12-2017T18:01:17,Combak,"Now, just hope a spot opens up."
30-12-2017T18:01:33,CrimsonHelsing,Someone plz tell me when one does
30-12-2017T18:02:07,ZizzoGaming,"Unfortunately, @CrimsonHelsing I don't think one will"
30-12-2017T18:02:09,Aviark,"You may be cool, but you'll never be Keith cool"

30-12-2017T18:02:38,Bgrmystr2,"or maybe, Crimson, you could watch the twokinds patreon"
30-12-2017T18:02:45,Bgrmystr2,and look for the slot after the year ends?
30-12-2017T18:02:51,Bgrmystr2,like everyone else does?

30-12-2017T19:53:57,Mustanglvr007,Im definitely supercharging it's stock engine though. The turbo'd EJ20 or EJ25 engines are stupid expensive to buy.
30-12-2017T19:54:11,Russianconservative,yeah geopolitics are my thing
30-12-2017T19:54:15,TheBeckoner,Youre not gonna turbo it?
30-12-2017T19:54:22,Mustanglvr007,And there's no way I'm doing a 3.0 or 3.6 boxer swap
30-12-2017T19:54:24,TheBeckoner,Isnt it already turbo'd?
30-12-2017T19:54:47,Mustanglvr007,"Nah, I wanna stick out. Gotta love that low end torque."

30-12-2017T20:06:14,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah the genetic differences seem very slight
30-12-2017T20:06:22,CrRAR,It should have been revealed that the tallests were just three irkens under an overcoat.
30-12-2017T20:06:30,unsteddyphoenix,Because this is an UNEQUAL WORLD
30-12-2017T20:06:33,Russianconservative,just noticed that

30-12-2017T20:41:08,TheBeckoner,More monitors?
30-12-2017T20:41:18,Russianconservative,hey Heresy
30-12-2017T20:41:20,HeresyArtStream,the problem is that picarto is very GPU hungry
30-12-2017T20:41:27,LeKnightWolf,must be fun to play the villian
30-12-2017T20:41:30,Xexanoth,Lifehack: get more eyes

30-12-2017T20:42:30,TheBeckoner,Network hungry
30-12-2017T20:42:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'd be happy not seeing a ford in my drive way
30-12-2017T20:42:38,TheBeckoner,lol

30-12-2017T22:50:33,TheBeckoner,The amount of time Flora has been prego
30-12-2017T22:50:56,MidnightBlue78,do you guys she's having more than one baby?
30-12-2017T22:51:05,MidnightBlue78,*think
30-12-2017T22:52:13,LeKnightWolf,well that depends on what is going on with the story and how their lives will be placed into the world
30-12-2017T22:52:54,LeKnightWolf,"as such, powers, appearance, and future will need to be figured out"
30-12-2017T22:53:42,LeKnightWolf,instead of just placing in for the sake of just happening
30-12-2017T22:56:34,unsteddyphoenix,I would guess she's just having one? But it's definitely possible it's more
30-12-2017T22:56:56,MidnightBlue78,"if it's just wonder, i wonder if it'll be a boy"
30-12-2017T22:57:09,MidnightBlue78,since we already have maddie and maeve

30-12-2017T23:03:15,RandomTKLover,"I'm a guy and obviously no expert on pregnancy, but I can still state what I think. Even though flora’s belly size changes all the time, I think (based on the last two comics) if flora’s timing (2 months) is correct, it might be more than one baby."
30-12-2017T23:03:16,ZizzoGaming,"Anything you say, your Majesty"
