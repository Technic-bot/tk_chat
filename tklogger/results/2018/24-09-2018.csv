24-09-2018T18:49:48,CrRAR,MAXIMUM vacationing
24-09-2018T19:52:07,Dadrobit,Buddy of mine in the audio community just sent me some adorable videos of him and another friend annoying some animals at a local zoo.
24-09-2018T19:52:23,Dadrobit,How not to record a lion: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB-68IsPp7g
24-09-2018T19:52:57,Dadrobit,They were not very cooperative lions.
24-09-2018T20:19:42,Xexanoth,they should have brought food
24-09-2018T21:00:21,unsteddyphoenix,Lioness silently wants to kill you (2018)

24-09-2018T23:30:46,TorqueEmUp,Is it me or does going on vacation more often then not wear you out and make you tired more than it makes you relaxed?
24-09-2018T23:30:49,TorqueEmUp,:p
24-09-2018T23:31:29,Bgrmystr2,well yeah cuz vacation is usually just relaxing while working is physically exausting usually
24-09-2018T23:31:31,TorqueEmUp,Relaxing bit is going home and being able to sleep in your own bed.
24-09-2018T23:32:15,Bgrmystr2,"vacations are not as physically demanding as a lot of jobs, so if your vacation IS more physically demanding, then of course it's going to feel backwards"
24-09-2018T23:32:45,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
24-09-2018T23:33:58,Bgrmystr2,"also, vacation isn't just for physical removal of your station, it's also a mental removal, though most people don't bother taking a break during vacation if their job doesn't require themn to be physically at a place to do a thing"
24-09-2018T23:34:39,TorqueEmUp,"Vacations are more mentally exhausting, because you are away from home not sleeping in a bed your are used to, spending lots of money so that's always going to be on your subconcious, and god forbid if you have kids and bring them with you."
24-09-2018T23:34:57,Bgrmystr2,then you're doing it wrong.
24-09-2018T23:35:29,Bgrmystr2,it's not a vacation if you're taking your mental baggage with you.
24-09-2018T23:35:38,Bgrmystr2,you're supposed to leave it behind.
24-09-2018T23:35:55,TorqueEmUp,"You always are going to have mental baggage, because the vacation adds it's own."
24-09-2018T23:36:25,TorqueEmUp,"If you are poor like me, you are constantly thinking about how much money this is costing."
24-09-2018T23:36:41,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, but it's getting you away from the dullness of normal life, it's supposed to be different, interesting, and fun."
24-09-2018T23:36:51,TorqueEmUp,Exactly
24-09-2018T23:37:00,Bgrmystr2,then you're just planning it wrong :P
24-09-2018T23:37:11,Bgrmystr2,"cuz it CAN be that, even for poor people lol"
24-09-2018T23:37:23,Bgrmystr2,it just requires a different approach
24-09-2018T23:37:30,TorqueEmUp,"You remove yourself from your current routines, and just get away."
24-09-2018T23:37:46,Bgrmystr2,"yep, that's idea."
24-09-2018T23:37:51,Bgrmystr2,it's not specific
24-09-2018T23:39:20,TorqueEmUp,People have different ideas on what a vacation is really.
24-09-2018T23:39:45,TorqueEmUp,"But yeah, mine is just getting away."
24-09-2018T23:39:52,TorqueEmUp,Doing something different.
24-09-2018T23:40:01,TorqueEmUp,While still trying to save as much money as I can.
24-09-2018T23:40:07,Bgrmystr2,that's not really how it works.  someone who works physical labor in construction or machinery for example won't have the same vacation as someone who works from home in their chair managing stocks.
24-09-2018T23:40:19,TorqueEmUp,getting the cheapest hotels that aren't complete dumps.
24-09-2018T23:40:23,Bgrmystr2,A vacation does not change meaning simply because different people have different needs.
24-09-2018T23:40:30,Bgrmystr2,"it's still a vacation, and it's still to get away."
24-09-2018T23:40:36,Bgrmystr2,no matter the contents.
24-09-2018T23:40:55,TorqueEmUp,Just changes depending on income
24-09-2018T23:41:05,TorqueEmUp,but yeah
24-09-2018T23:41:07,Bgrmystr2,I don't think income really matters at all.
24-09-2018T23:41:19,TorqueEmUp,"It matters on what you do, and how far your go."
24-09-2018T23:41:22,Bgrmystr2,it only affects the amount of options you have.
24-09-2018T23:41:24,TorqueEmUp,you*
24-09-2018T23:41:36,TorqueEmUp,and how long
24-09-2018T23:42:29,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, I've never needed a vacation, though you could consider sometimes I take them by doing something completely different than usual. I don't have to leave the house to vacation from the droll of the usual."
24-09-2018T23:42:37,Bgrmystr2,it's not a necessity
24-09-2018T23:43:32,Bgrmystr2,so money really doesn't affect it for the most part.
24-09-2018T23:46:43,Bgrmystr2,"also, people take physical vacations away from house because being there reminds them of the generic drone of life, and getting away from that helps them. I don't personally need that, but I'm pretty flexible."
