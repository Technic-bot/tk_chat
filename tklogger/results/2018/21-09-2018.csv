21-09-2018T00:29:15,SageSaga,when it gets in my eyes is when its time to cut it
21-09-2018T00:30:00,unsteddyphoenix,All those anime characters seem to be able to see just fine

21-09-2018T01:25:54,SageSaga,actually more women have played Vampire than D&D
21-09-2018T01:26:09,unsteddyphoenix,A) what is vampire
21-09-2018T01:26:17,unsteddyphoenix,B) is that a direct result of twilight
21-09-2018T01:26:22,unsteddyphoenix,Uh
21-09-2018T01:26:24,Ordithus,All the girls I know who play dnd are already taken

21-09-2018T01:26:48,SageSaga,predates Twilight
21-09-2018T01:26:59,SageSaga,there is a video game of it
21-09-2018T01:27:02,unsteddyphoenix,Doesnt mean it's populairty wasnt influenced by twilight
21-09-2018T01:27:09,SageSaga,but naw- lots of Goth kids play it
21-09-2018T01:27:20,Ordithus,ha
21-09-2018T01:27:22,SageSaga,and Goths have a good female ratio
21-09-2018T01:28:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Only experience I have with D&D is reading a thread of D&D stories

21-09-2018T01:39:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Also a 40mph guy shooting through the air at you is reasonably terrifying enough
21-09-2018T01:39:37,Ordithus,Who then... hits on the guard
21-09-2018T01:40:05,Ordithus,Make love not war

21-09-2018T01:59:19,SpazztasticKiwi,A guy with hawk armor...?
21-09-2018T01:59:29,unsteddyphoenix,^?
21-09-2018T01:59:31,SageSaga,they have hawk wings too
21-09-2018T01:59:49,unsteddyphoenix,oh ok.
21-09-2018T02:00:47,Ordithus,":ctwokinds-natanisleep: Good night, all.  Thanks for the arty art, Sage!"
21-09-2018T02:00:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Saw the wings
21-09-2018T02:00:49,SageSaga,long story short- I rolled a 37ish on a d12+8 and the hawk man countered with a 38 on a D6+2
21-09-2018T02:00:56,unsteddyphoenix,night ord
21-09-2018T02:01:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Ord
21-09-2018T02:01:15,unsteddyphoenix,"Ok, so."
21-09-2018T02:01:17,unsteddyphoenix,Um.
21-09-2018T02:01:20,unsteddyphoenix,What?
21-09-2018T02:01:47,SageSaga,in Savage Worlds- when you roll a skill check - like a Seduction roll- if you roll Max- you roll again and add it to the total
21-09-2018T02:01:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"Cool, but while I’d like the ability to fly, me and heights don’t hang"
21-09-2018T02:02:06,unsteddyphoenix,"Hahaha wow, what a crit system"
21-09-2018T02:02:07,SageSaga,its called Exploding Dice
21-09-2018T02:02:32,unsteddyphoenix,So...the birdman got 5 max rolls in a row?
21-09-2018T02:02:39,SageSaga,yeah
21-09-2018T02:02:44,Bgrmystr2,what the crap
21-09-2018T02:02:48,Bgrmystr2,xD
21-09-2018T02:02:50,SageSaga,it happens
21-09-2018T02:02:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Lucky bird
21-09-2018T02:03:05,unsteddyphoenix,Sus DM
21-09-2018T02:03:32,SageSaga,in fact- one way to kinda cheat the system a bit is to leave your skill at the second lowest it can go - a d4 because you have a 1/4 chance of getting max and rolling again- and then another 1/4 chance
21-09-2018T02:03:41,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds like SOMEone wanted to stop your seductive rampage
21-09-2018T02:04:00,SageSaga,in Savage worlds we roll in the open for stuff like that
21-09-2018T02:04:16,SageSaga,it was legit
21-09-2018T02:04:20,unsteddyphoenix,Oh wow. Nvm then.
21-09-2018T02:04:27,unsteddyphoenix,Birb of legend
21-09-2018T02:04:55,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
21-09-2018T02:05:01,SageSaga,just like how one of our guys ruined a boss fight by rolling a 59 on his attack on a creature in the dark
21-09-2018T02:05:44,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, it sounds to me like someone actually knows how to roll a dice to make it land on a specific side"
21-09-2018T02:05:58,SageSaga,The evil spider like horror cackled and with his laughter the light faded and smoke poured into the room- the doofus threw a dagger for 59
21-09-2018T02:06:14,unsteddyphoenix,Does the higher number do more damage too?
21-09-2018T02:06:37,SageSaga,"nah but we do use a ""Incredible hit"" rule for when that stuff happens"
21-09-2018T02:06:54,unsteddyphoenix,"Because ""critical hit"" was trademarked?"
21-09-2018T02:06:59,SageSaga,and there is no such thing as rolling a dice so it lands how you want so long as you are rolling properly
21-09-2018T02:07:23,SageSaga,critical hits are 4 over the threashold
21-09-2018T02:07:37,unsteddyphoenix,Ah
21-09-2018T02:07:44,unsteddyphoenix,Whereas this is like. 50 over the threshold
21-09-2018T02:07:47,SageSaga,"something that is like 3 times the threshold are ""Incredible hits"""
21-09-2018T02:08:50,unsteddyphoenix,What a system
21-09-2018T02:08:55,SageSaga,its like throwing a dagger at an enemy and it just manages to go in the eye slit of the guys armor and hits hard enough to drive through the eye and into the brain-
21-09-2018T02:08:56,unsteddyphoenix,It sounds like borderlands the rpg
21-09-2018T02:09:39,SageSaga,that same guy jumped off a mountain and plunged his sword into the back of an evil Dragon God
21-09-2018T02:10:23,SageSaga,naturally he rolled a 60 something- Ninja Tom did the same and landed on the Good Dragon God and called upon his gods magic to empower the good dragon god-
21-09-2018T02:10:33,SageSaga,rolled like a 70 something
21-09-2018T02:10:51,SageSaga,i tried to take the path down to them- rolled a 1 and almost died sliding down the mountain side
21-09-2018T02:11:04,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
21-09-2018T02:11:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Teacher voice: “You’ll use algebra in your everyday life”
21-09-2018T02:11:13,unsteddyphoenix,Now thats a classic
21-09-2018T02:11:19,Bgrmystr2,"it's not even algebra though, kiwi"
21-09-2018T02:12:01,unsteddyphoenix,I assume they were having a dragon fight in a dragon ravine or something
21-09-2018T02:13:43,SageSaga,pretty much- the evil bad guys were resurrecting the evil dragon god and our cleric was holding part of the soul of the good dragon god inside him- so when we got him to see the awakening evil dragon - the good one woke up and came charging in
21-09-2018T02:14:40,Bgrmystr2,"""Evil bad guys"" as opposed to the good bad guys."
21-09-2018T02:14:48,SageSaga,by the time i got down to the fight the evil dragon god was limping away and i sacrificed myself to bind him with blood magic
21-09-2018T02:15:04,unsteddyphoenix,Not Hunee! D:
21-09-2018T02:15:13,SageSaga,this was not the game with Hunnee
21-09-2018T02:15:27,SageSaga,she would have seduced him
21-09-2018T02:16:11,SageSaga,probably call him a really bad boy
21-09-2018T02:16:25,unsteddyphoenix,Phew
21-09-2018T02:17:23,unsteddyphoenix,I have a character thats in a long term relationship with a dragon atm.
21-09-2018T02:17:30,SageSaga,there was one game i ran away and let all my friends get killed
21-09-2018T02:17:56,unsteddyphoenix,Oooh ive been there
21-09-2018T02:18:16,unsteddyphoenix,Except it was my awful rolls that got us there in the first place
21-09-2018T02:18:32,unsteddyphoenix,But somehow I was the only survivor~
21-09-2018T02:18:46,SageSaga,giant snake picked me up - started crushing me - i almost died right there- i managed to slip out barely
21-09-2018T02:19:07,SageSaga,"and the GM was like ""Ok, your turn - what do you do?"" ""I run"" and everyone looks at me"
21-09-2018T02:19:39,SageSaga,"and im like ""In this world people hate Elves- I dont like any of you, you've all been dicks, I dont care if the town dies- they are all filthy humans! I RUN!"""
21-09-2018T02:20:03,SageSaga,and I ran. I ran so far away
21-09-2018T02:20:10,SageSaga,I just ran
21-09-2018T02:20:11,unsteddyphoenix,"Around elves, watch yourselves"
21-09-2018T02:20:32,Bgrmystr2,"ay sage, good song :ok_hand:"
21-09-2018T02:20:46,SageSaga,:P
21-09-2018T02:21:15,SageSaga,"and sure enough- they all died- and they realized ""Wow- that elf is really fast!"""
21-09-2018T02:21:23,Bgrmystr2,xD
21-09-2018T02:21:38,unsteddyphoenix,gotta go fast~
21-09-2018T02:21:51,unsteddyphoenix,And we all learnt a valuable lesson
21-09-2018T02:21:56,unsteddyphoenix,"""never trust an elf"""
21-09-2018T02:22:10,unsteddyphoenix,The end :upside_down:
21-09-2018T02:22:50,SageSaga,"they were like ""I had no idea he could run that fast"" and the GM was like ""Well- he is an Elf, and his class is a Scout built"""
21-09-2018T02:23:04,SageSaga,this was a Dragon Age system
21-09-2018T02:23:43,SageSaga,man ive played in a lot of different game systems
21-09-2018T02:24:05,SageSaga,the worse was Star Wars Fantasy Flight Games system
21-09-2018T02:24:21,SageSaga,that system is DUMB
21-09-2018T02:24:32,Mihari,"Hehe, our group will see how fast I can get away if flgiht is an option XD"
21-09-2018T02:24:50,unsteddyphoenix,Ooooh a dragon age system
21-09-2018T02:25:10,unsteddyphoenix,Love that game
21-09-2018T02:25:11,SageSaga,"""You rolled really well so you succeed but because of this one die you also fail"" ""What?"""
21-09-2018T02:26:22,unsteddyphoenix,Have you played beyonder?
21-09-2018T02:26:41,SageSaga,"""you can only carry 3 grenades"" ""But i have this satchel and this bandoleer and this belt"" ""Yeah- the grenades are just too heavy"" ""What"""
21-09-2018T02:26:48,sunblaze,wait what sage? you fail because you are too good?
21-09-2018T02:27:33,SageSaga,it has a really dumb system where you can succeed but also fail at the same time
21-09-2018T02:27:44,unsteddyphoenix,Me irl
21-09-2018T02:28:00,BadFoMo,You went past win and rapped around to fail?
21-09-2018T02:28:17,Mihari,"It's like, ""you drew a perfecf circle, too bad you're drawing boobs"""
21-09-2018T02:28:22,SageSaga,"like ""You hit them- and deal damage- but it also is usually loud so you are alerting the other guards"""
21-09-2018T02:28:53,SageSaga,"""But my stealth was super good! and im stabbing him!"" ""Yeah - you pierce- i dunno- a balloon or something"""
21-09-2018T02:29:11,Bgrmystr2,that.. sounds like bs to me
21-09-2018T02:29:14,SageSaga,it is
21-09-2018T02:29:16,sunblaze,^that
21-09-2018T02:29:19,SageSaga,the system is garbage
21-09-2018T02:30:32,SageSaga,"i was making my Star Wars Character ""Ken"" from another star wars game"
21-09-2018T02:31:00,SageSaga,"he had a saying ""Grenade"" ""Wait- did you just say that or did you just throw a grenade?"" ""Both"""
21-09-2018T02:31:12,unsteddyphoenix,The poor DM that has to justify that lol
21-09-2018T02:31:16,unsteddyphoenix,What stress
21-09-2018T02:31:33,ZRO4825,Greatest thing about Star Wars paper & dice game. Making a Gungan Jedi. And annoying your friends by speaking like a proper Gungan. &lt;3
21-09-2018T02:32:01,SageSaga,but because the inventory system was terrible it made it impossible to carry decent quantities of grenades even if you could afford them
21-09-2018T02:32:01,Mihari,I should ban you for even thinking that's a good idea and fun.
21-09-2018T02:32:27,ZRO4825,"I can show you the character sheet, I actually found it a few days ago. :P"
21-09-2018T02:32:52,unsteddyphoenix,Tbh seconded mihari
21-09-2018T02:32:57,ZRO4825,No love. D:
21-09-2018T02:33:01,SageSaga,none
21-09-2018T02:33:09,Mihari,That's enough to turn me to the dark side.
21-09-2018T02:33:11,SageSaga,you only get love when you deserve it
21-09-2018T02:33:16,Mihari,Channel my hate
21-09-2018T02:33:28,unsteddyphoenix,Let it flow through you
21-09-2018T02:33:36,unsteddyphoenix,Entirely justified
21-09-2018T02:33:38,Bgrmystr2,I don't even know what a Gungan is
21-09-2018T02:33:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake:
21-09-2018T02:33:43,ZRO4825,Jar-Jar Binks
21-09-2018T02:33:44,SageSaga,I did make an awesome Jedi character- he used 5 light sabers
21-09-2018T02:34:00,Bgrmystr2,"oh, zro you're a monster :ptv-laugh:"
21-09-2018T02:34:04,ZRO4825,XD
21-09-2018T02:34:21,unsteddyphoenix,Was he a...general grievous?
21-09-2018T02:34:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hello there
21-09-2018T02:34:34,SageSaga,https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/4/4c/Kreia_KotORCG.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20090601053448
21-09-2018T02:34:37,ZRO4825,"To be fair, the REST of his race isn't QUITE so annoying...because they're actually a fairly nimble warrior race. Jar-jar was actually just the equivalent of the village idiot, lol"
21-09-2018T02:34:52,SageSaga,his focus was defensive styles and Force Sorcery
21-09-2018T02:34:59,ZRO4825,Neat
21-09-2018T02:35:27,SageSaga,So he would telekinetically control 3 sabers and use them to defend his allies while using the two he had to defend himself and those near him
21-09-2018T02:35:43,Mihari,Why didn't I think of that...
21-09-2018T02:36:03,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds busted
21-09-2018T02:36:11,SageSaga,Jedi were busted
21-09-2018T02:36:35,SageSaga,we had one brute Jedi- using a Great Lightsaber- tore through blast doors like tissue paper
21-09-2018T02:36:41,sunblaze,thats a lot of blaster reflection then :P
21-09-2018T02:36:58,SageSaga,one pure Sorcery Jedi
21-09-2018T02:37:11,SageSaga,one Classic Jedi
21-09-2018T02:37:21,SageSaga,and a Mandalorian Warrior
21-09-2018T02:38:19,SageSaga,He was under powered compared to the Jedi but - when it came to spaceship battles and how he knew our abilities- he was a great tactician in space
21-09-2018T02:38:33,unsteddyphoenix,Great lightsaber lmao
21-09-2018T02:38:51,sunblaze,thats the oversized 2 handed one huh :D
21-09-2018T02:39:00,unsteddyphoenix,Was there a great lighthammer ???
21-09-2018T02:39:04,sunblaze,ohhh
21-09-2018T02:39:49,SageSaga,our Brute Jedi was a Togorian
21-09-2018T02:40:12,SageSaga,https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/1/18/Togorian_head.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20090421075051
21-09-2018T02:40:44,SageSaga,7-9 foot talk Tiger people
21-09-2018T02:41:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ptv-ohmy:
21-09-2018T02:41:11,SageSaga,so he used a large sized Lightsaber- a great lightsaber
21-09-2018T02:42:20,SageSaga,"we had this one scene- where we were on a space station attacking these sith - they retreated behind a blast door and closed it- he tore it down in one round- and they yelled ""QUICK! RUN TO THE OTHER BLAST DOOR!"""
21-09-2018T02:43:11,SageSaga,then our sorcerer jedi force slammed them all
21-09-2018T02:45:11,SageSaga,btw- most OP force power? Fold Space
21-09-2018T02:46:18,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah who cares about force lightning when you can just force hold someone and slice them
21-09-2018T02:46:44,SageSaga,one cool thing about that version of star wars RPG was that you could always call upon the dark side for more damage- just hope you can resist the corruption
21-09-2018T02:47:47,unsteddyphoenix,That's more how I imagined the dark side anyway
21-09-2018T02:49:05,SageSaga,they even have feats that let you remove the darkside descriptor from force powers like Force Lightning is a dark power- but with a feat- it's not
21-09-2018T02:49:41,sunblaze,as if force lighting is evil anyway. depends on suage. to spark a machinery why not?
21-09-2018T02:49:47,sunblaze,to electrify enemies maybe :D
21-09-2018T02:50:01,sunblaze,to torture fur sure!
21-09-2018T02:50:09,unsteddyphoenix,Wait that's kinda weird
21-09-2018T02:50:20,SageSaga,Force Lighting from the cannon was only possible if you used your emotion to fuel it
21-09-2018T02:50:24,unsteddyphoenix,Make an evil ability not evil with just a feat?
21-09-2018T02:50:32,sunblaze,I am aware of that. thats why canon sucks
21-09-2018T02:50:40,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds like having your cake and eating it too a bit
21-09-2018T02:51:03,SageSaga,a feat is not something to waste so easily
21-09-2018T02:51:53,Bgrmystr2,so.. canonically.. emotions are evil
21-09-2018T02:51:56,Bgrmystr2,rip
21-09-2018T02:52:06,Bgrmystr2,everyone go become a robot now.
21-09-2018T02:52:21,sunblaze,they cloud the mind and yes that leads to the dark side
21-09-2018T02:52:25,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah that's legit how it is bgr
21-09-2018T02:52:41,Bgrmystr2,xD that's the dumbest shit
21-09-2018T02:52:43,unsteddyphoenix,The Jedi didn't do things so wel
21-09-2018T02:53:02,unsteddyphoenix,It's why they got MESSED UP but one angsty boi
21-09-2018T02:53:06,unsteddyphoenix,By
21-09-2018T02:53:31,sunblaze,he is not the first to fall in that trap an will not be the last
21-09-2018T02:53:51,sunblaze,he was for certain just plain stupid yes and probably not jedi material at all
21-09-2018T02:53:55,sunblaze,but the heritage :P
21-09-2018T02:54:43,Bgrmystr2,"I guess noone bothered to tell them that emotions aren't evil, it's what you do with that emotion that makes you who you are."
21-09-2018T02:55:09,sunblaze,not evil but they hollow out rationallity
21-09-2018T02:55:21,sunblaze,basically a vulcan would make an outstanding jedi
21-09-2018T02:56:01,Mihari,No they wouldn't
21-09-2018T02:56:41,Mihari,Since Jedi's are forbidden from coupling and coupling is required every 7 years for a vulcan to maintain their emotional composure if they are away from loved ones.
21-09-2018T02:56:54,sunblaze,oh right good point
21-09-2018T02:57:54,SageSaga,all done folks
21-09-2018T02:58:01,SageSaga,have a good night hope you had fun!

21-09-2018T14:01:57,CrimsonQuill,Hello Sage
21-09-2018T14:02:27,SageSaga,yo
21-09-2018T14:02:48,CrimsonQuill,I read an entire year's worth of Yosh last night...
21-09-2018T14:03:18,SageSaga,which year?
21-09-2018T14:04:01,CrimsonQuill,2008.
21-09-2018T14:04:07,CrimsonQuill,I don't trust PenPen...
21-09-2018T14:04:22,SageSaga,what's not to trust?
21-09-2018T14:04:45,CrimsonQuill,He's a talking penguin who continually pops up demanding Jelly.
21-09-2018T14:05:02,CrimsonQuill,I'll bet he's some demon or magic creature of some sort...
21-09-2018T14:05:11,CrimsonQuill,No Spoilers anyhow.
21-09-2018T14:05:19,CrimsonQuill,I want to see whether I'm right or not.
21-09-2018T14:05:43,CrimsonQuill,I still have another 10 years worth os comics to read.
21-09-2018T14:05:44,SageSaga,well I hope you are enjoying it
21-09-2018T14:06:08,CrimsonQuill,I am! It's like Twokinds in a way-growing with Every strip!
21-09-2018T14:06:20,CrimsonQuill,Plus Tom's fillers are funny.
21-09-2018T14:07:10,CrimsonQuill,"THe only problem (as with every webcomic, comic, book I read) is what voives and Accents I give the characters in my head."
21-09-2018T14:07:43,SageSaga,Nami has a southern accent that she tries to hide most of the time
21-09-2018T14:08:09,FoxxTrotter,Mmm...Jell-O. :0)
21-09-2018T14:08:20,CrimsonQuill,That's the problem. I don't live in the US. So I couldn't tell what accents they are if I was hit over the head with it.
21-09-2018T14:08:36,CrimsonQuill,"Heck, I have trouble distinguishing my own country's accents!"
21-09-2018T14:08:49,SageSaga,hmm- ever seen a US Western?
21-09-2018T14:08:53,CrimsonQuill,Nope.
21-09-2018T14:09:08,SageSaga,"have ya heard the word ""Y'all""?"
21-09-2018T14:09:11,CrimsonQuill,Yep.
21-09-2018T14:09:19,CrimsonQuill,Is that the accent?
21-09-2018T14:09:26,CrimsonQuill,"Texan, like Joel from the Last of Us"
21-09-2018T14:09:29,CrimsonQuill,?
21-09-2018T14:09:33,SageSaga,"""Y'all come back now, y'hear?"""
21-09-2018T14:09:46,CrimsonQuill,Sounds like the characters from 'The help'
21-09-2018T14:09:48,SageSaga,yeah kinda. Texan is a little different but its close
21-09-2018T14:10:05,CrimsonQuill,I have one more question.
21-09-2018T14:10:21,CrimsonQuill,How are you going to be able to shoehorn all that story into just 500 pages?
21-09-2018T14:10:50,SageSaga,cut a lot
21-09-2018T14:11:09,CrimsonQuill,WOahkay
21-09-2018T14:11:18,SageSaga,try to fit every arc into a 26 page comic
21-09-2018T14:11:33,CrimsonQuill,That's going to be tough.
21-09-2018T14:12:17,SageSaga,there's a lot of early stuff I can cut pretty easily
21-09-2018T14:12:24,CrimsonQuill,And this is from someone who's last real attempt at a comic was a ripoff of the Calvin and Hobbes Spaceman Spiff fantasies at age 9.
21-09-2018T14:12:28,CrimsonQuill,Me.
21-09-2018T14:12:30,CrimsonQuill,I meant
21-09-2018T14:12:32,CrimsonQuill,Not you.
21-09-2018T14:12:38,CrimsonQuill,Your comic's brilliant.
21-09-2018T14:12:46,CrimsonQuill,I did it again....
21-09-2018T14:13:00,CrimsonQuill,I assumed what people would say before they said it...
21-09-2018T14:13:32,SageSaga,:P
21-09-2018T14:13:56,CrimsonQuill,Yep.
21-09-2018T14:14:11,CrimsonQuill,I actually had a short chat with Tom about Doctor WHo a few days ago...
21-09-2018T14:14:21,Dadrobit,Did someone mention y'all?
21-09-2018T14:14:26,SageSaga,XD
21-09-2018T14:14:27,Dadrobit,Howdy!
21-09-2018T14:14:35,SageSaga,Howdy Thar Dadrobit!
21-09-2018T14:14:38,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-victory::ptv-victory::ptv-victory::ptv-greetings::ptv-greetings::ptv-greetings:
21-09-2018T14:14:57,CrimsonQuill,I love these emojis. Hullo Dadrobit!
21-09-2018T14:14:59,FoxxTrotter,I haven't watched much of the newer Doctor Who stuff. I like the old ones better.
21-09-2018T14:15:26,SageSaga,i talked to Tom last night
21-09-2018T14:15:32,CrimsonQuill,'Dalek' and 'Army of Ghosts/Doomsdat' are perhaps the best Dalek stories of the Series.
21-09-2018T14:15:42,CrimsonQuill,I wish I could meet Tom personally.
21-09-2018T14:16:02,FoxxTrotter,'The Five Doctors' is probably one of the best specials.
21-09-2018T14:16:18,CrimsonQuill,But a flight to San Diego and back (not including Comic Con tickets and Accommodation) costs 400-500 minimum.
21-09-2018T14:16:26,FoxxTrotter,"Although, it only has Tom Baker in it for a short part."
21-09-2018T14:16:31,CrimsonQuill,Pyramids of Mars is good.
21-09-2018T14:16:46,CrimsonQuill,Tom Baker's my favourite with Tennant and Capaldi.
21-09-2018T14:16:55,CrimsonQuill,'Jelly Baby?'
21-09-2018T14:16:56,SageSaga,Tom Baker is awesome
21-09-2018T14:17:28,FoxxTrotter,:0)
21-09-2018T14:17:35,CrimsonQuill,'Would you like a Jelly Baby-''SHUT UP!' *beat* 'A simple no thank you would have sufficed.'
21-09-2018T14:29:49,SageSaga,hmm- What color should the Ogre be...
21-09-2018T14:30:13,CrimsonQuill,"I'm not even watching the stream, because I'm afraid of Spoilers."
21-09-2018T14:30:17,CrimsonQuill,I'm here for the chat.
21-09-2018T14:31:21,FoxxTrotter,"Most are green, but it doesn't always have to be."
21-09-2018T14:36:23,CrimsonQuill,Try making him a sallow Warhammer Fantasy Green
21-09-2018T14:37:50,LannAF,Damnit
21-09-2018T14:37:57,LannAF,hiyooo
21-09-2018T14:38:00,SageSaga,:P
21-09-2018T14:38:01,CrimsonQuill,Hello
21-09-2018T14:38:12,LannAF,I forgot to ask about MHA earlier sage
21-09-2018T14:38:13,LannAF,sorry :L
21-09-2018T14:38:27,SageSaga,free later?
21-09-2018T14:38:54,Bgrmystr2,mornin
21-09-2018T14:39:24,SageSaga,yo Bgr
21-09-2018T14:41:35,Bgrmystr2,still confused how our AC thinks it's 81 when it's only 75
21-09-2018T14:43:33,SageSaga,where is the thermometer?
21-09-2018T14:45:16,Bgrmystr2,"far as I know, it's inside the thermostat"
21-09-2018T14:45:46,SageSaga,find out where- because it might be next to an element heating up or shorting out
21-09-2018T14:45:52,Bgrmystr2,"tis what 4 or 5 ppl have said, after we've been fighting this damn thing since moving here in.. may.. june."
21-09-2018T14:46:22,SageSaga,or replace it
21-09-2018T14:48:26,Bgrmystr2,"well, we've had at least 3 different repairmen come out and say it's ""working fine"" when it hasn't held the correct temp since we've been here.. and it's apparently supposedly new"
21-09-2018T14:52:57,SageSaga,you let repairmen get away with telling you something is fine when it clearly isnt?
21-09-2018T14:54:36,SageSaga,you know what would happen if I did that? I would be trying to run a high speed lan in my house over a single copper wire
21-09-2018T14:55:20,SageSaga,for those who dont know - It takes 8 copper wires for a LAN connection
21-09-2018T14:56:19,SageSaga,"the electrician insisted he ran the cable right and i said ""Then why are there single copper cable wires hanging out- where theyre should be a whole cat6 cable?"""
21-09-2018T14:57:21,Bgrmystr2,"Well I'm not really the one that's ""in charge"" of taking care of electrician shit"
21-09-2018T14:58:54,SageSaga,"yeah well my father looked at me - hes been working with computers since they used punch cards, and asked me ""Wait- is that true? Can we just use one copper cable?"""
21-09-2018T14:59:49,SageSaga,"and the Electrician got a smug look on his face and i said ""NO, only an idiot would think an 8 pin Ethernet cable could run on ONE copper wire."""
21-09-2018T15:00:51,Bgrmystr2,lol
21-09-2018T15:01:11,SageSaga,"and my father looked back at him and said ""Well how many of these have you run?"" and he was like ""We run this stuff all the time"" and I was like ""You run it for Phones dont you? You use Cat6, split it and run the pairs out for telephone land lines"""
21-09-2018T15:02:03,SageSaga,"My dad asked - ""How many have you ran for Ethernet internet?"" and he was like ""People use phone lines for Internet"""
21-09-2018T15:02:35,Bgrmystr2,:face_palm: no they don't goddamn
21-09-2018T15:02:53,zolstarym,"Even phones need 2 wires, not one"
21-09-2018T15:02:58,SageSaga,"and I was like ""15 years ago maybe! Run a cat6 cable- the whole thing- from here- to there- then another from here to there - and then one more!"""
21-09-2018T15:03:11,SageSaga,i said that Zol
21-09-2018T15:03:38,SageSaga,the wires in the cat6 are twisted pairs
21-09-2018T15:04:17,CrimsonQuill,Permission to intersect abrupt subject change?
21-09-2018T15:04:25,SageSaga,got one more line-
21-09-2018T15:05:50,SageSaga,"the electrician said ""Well im sure this would work fine."" and i was furious at this point and said ""You want to bet on that? You cant even attach the fitting on the end of it with 2 cables! I have them in my car right now if you want to find out but -"
21-09-2018T15:06:00,SageSaga,"You'll be wasting my time and yours!"""
21-09-2018T15:07:11,SageSaga,so he ran the cables but he was still a dick because he used the old split cable for one of them- which is how the lightning strike killed my adapter and 2 network cards on Mobos in the house
21-09-2018T15:07:25,SageSaga,theres an unshielded line in the wall
21-09-2018T15:09:59,SageSaga,that's it for the story of the retarded electrician and how even now 3 years later he screwed us
21-09-2018T15:10:43,CrimsonQuill,Have you got a better one?
21-09-2018T15:10:58,sunblaze,hiya
21-09-2018T15:11:12,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-greetings:
21-09-2018T15:11:32,SageSaga,i got surge protectors on all the network lines now and we are going to replace the lines with Cat7 once it gets cooler
21-09-2018T15:11:34,FoxxTrotter,"Hey, Sunblaze."
21-09-2018T15:11:39,SageSaga,yo Sunblaze
21-09-2018T15:12:19,CrimsonQuill,I have just bought well known Rage game 'Getting Over It with Bennet Foddy'
21-09-2018T15:12:48,SageSaga,why?
21-09-2018T15:12:59,CrimsonQuill,Because I want to play it.
21-09-2018T15:13:07,SageSaga,good reason i guess
21-09-2018T15:13:19,CrimsonQuill,"Also, i made a wager with my friend."
21-09-2018T15:13:27,CrimsonQuill,But mostly I just want to play it.
21-09-2018T15:13:34,CrimsonQuill,Take my time up the mountain.
21-09-2018T15:13:39,CrimsonQuill,With Smooth Jazz.
21-09-2018T15:14:06,CrimsonQuill,Because Watching Mark rage over it was actually frightening sometimes. And tear-jerking.
21-09-2018T15:14:21,CrimsonQuill,"I mean, he had been through so much in that game..."
21-09-2018T15:14:37,CrimsonQuill,He deserved to reach the Top. Now it's time to see if I can.
21-09-2018T15:14:44,CrimsonQuill,Starting tomorrow.
21-09-2018T15:14:56,CrimsonQuill,How do you think I'll do?
21-09-2018T15:15:29,SageSaga,Well Mark plays up his reactions a lot
21-09-2018T15:16:00,CrimsonQuill,I wonder what'd happen if Tom made a sketch of Flora playing it...
21-09-2018T15:16:06,CrimsonQuill,Or Karen...
21-09-2018T15:16:42,CrimsonQuill,My first ever sketch suggestion was Mark teaching Raine to play FNaF. It didn't even get close.
21-09-2018T15:16:46,Combak,"Oh, hey Sage."
21-09-2018T15:16:55,SageSaga,yo Combak
21-09-2018T15:17:01,CrimsonQuill,Hullo
21-09-2018T15:17:13,CrimsonQuill,I think now's a good time to go testing...
21-09-2018T15:17:39,FoxxTrotter,"Heya, Combak."
21-09-2018T15:17:54,Combak,"Hey Sage, Crimson, Foxx."
21-09-2018T15:18:02,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-victory:
21-09-2018T15:37:39,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I'm off. GLaDOS wants me to check out some of her new tests."
21-09-2018T15:38:05,SageSaga,have fun!
21-09-2018T15:38:17,CrimsonQuill,Thanks! Goodnight!

21-09-2018T17:00:32,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: I guess that'd be answered when text rolls out on Wed
21-09-2018T17:00:34,Rosscoe,"Ok Sage catch yea later, I got a few more things to do, then finsih up some models"
21-09-2018T17:00:44,SageSaga,Relm hasnt been in this chapter at all
21-09-2018T17:00:47,FoxxTrotter,"C-ya, Rosscoe."

21-09-2018T17:01:12,Bgrmystr2,Relm was the first name that came to mind lol
21-09-2018T17:02:12,SageSaga,Kaylin is explaining what she knows happened in the 300 years
21-09-2018T17:02:18,Bgrmystr2,ahh okay
21-09-2018T17:02:49,Bgrmystr2,I just binged the entirety of all the Ah my goddess anime series the past few days so
21-09-2018T17:02:53,SageSaga,the monsters destroying settlements one after enough with little to stop them
21-09-2018T17:03:12,Bgrmystr2,I gotta reconnect with the AI again
21-09-2018T17:03:52,SageSaga,"only 3 more pages after this one - and then its on to Chapter 5, my favorite chapter so far"
21-09-2018T17:04:05,Bgrmystr2,:o
21-09-2018T17:04:14,FoxxTrotter,:0)
21-09-2018T17:04:21,Bgrmystr2,I'd ask what happens.. but that'd be telling :ptv-snicker:
21-09-2018T17:04:27,sunblaze,how far is the story for now?
21-09-2018T17:04:33,sunblaze,"6, 7 chapters?"
21-09-2018T17:04:42,sunblaze,the script I mean
