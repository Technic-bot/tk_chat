09-04-2018T00:04:13,Vatruvius,Then you do understand code a little bit.
09-04-2018T00:04:28,Dadrobit,"Yeah, took Java a few years back."
09-04-2018T00:05:33,Dadrobit,"Thinking about hitting the hay atm though. Was up all last night, need to catch up methinks."
09-04-2018T00:05:42,Vatruvius,Yeah...Processing is based on Java
09-04-2018T00:05:57,Vatruvius,"You do that Dadro, goodnight!"
09-04-2018T00:06:08,Dadrobit,o/
09-04-2018T02:49:08,Yeetskeet,Yeet
09-04-2018T07:42:18,NightMeaty22,good morning
09-04-2018T15:46:48,Vatruvius,Well...I am not so sure what to do now.
09-04-2018T17:25:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’ve been looking at weight management cats food. There’s so many options to consider, not to mention the fact I’d be getting it for just one cat"
09-04-2018T17:35:40,Vatruvius,:ptv-wondering:...is your cat getting too comfortable Kiwi?
09-04-2018T18:17:19,TheGamePlayer,Hi
09-04-2018T18:22:32,NightMeaty22,walks out of the shadows
09-04-2018T18:23:23,NightMeaty22,walks back and lurks
09-04-2018T18:37:34,Vatruvius,has to carry his team every game in Dreadnought.
09-04-2018T18:37:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Kiwi’s in a bit of need of a diet. She’s technically on one. It just doesn’t seem to be working
09-04-2018T18:38:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, I opened one of my art supply boxes. It smells heavily of paint. I suspect a bottle has busted inside"
09-04-2018T18:52:54,Vatruvius,That is physics for ya.
09-04-2018T19:15:49,NightMeaty22,returns from the shadows
09-04-2018T19:17:30,NightMeaty22,walks out the door and leaves it open
09-04-2018T19:17:51,NightMeaty22,just to mess with you
09-04-2018T19:57:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I do not have a normal cat. Bagheera just reached up on his back feet and stretched his front toes up to me
09-04-2018T19:57:44,SpazztasticKiwi,He wanted to be picked up
09-04-2018T19:57:51,BluePhantom90,hmm
09-04-2018T20:01:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I know - little weird
09-04-2018T20:01:44,TheGamePlayer,jupms from the shadows and scares Spazz!!!
09-04-2018T20:01:55,Vatruvius,My dog scratches me like when a dog acratches a door wanting to go out to get attention.
09-04-2018T20:02:15,SpazztasticKiwi,“I demand attention”
09-04-2018T20:02:28,TheGamePlayer,Acratches?
09-04-2018T20:02:43,Vatruvius,saves the day and apprends TheGamePlayer
09-04-2018T20:02:58,TheGamePlayer,What?
09-04-2018T20:03:09,Vatruvius,scratches* I am on my phone so...
09-04-2018T20:03:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, I’m not easily spooked; I once punched a friend in the stomach cause he thought I’d be a good idea to jump out at me though"
09-04-2018T20:03:34,TheGamePlayer,It's fine
09-04-2018T20:03:45,Vatruvius,lol
09-04-2018T20:04:02,Vatruvius,Bet he/she learned their lesson.
09-04-2018T20:05:42,TheGamePlayer,Soo the Oculus rift broke on the 3rd day of use Soo returned it and bout the HTCvive there goes $500 of my life
09-04-2018T20:05:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"Felt kinda bad, but yeah, he never did it again"
09-04-2018T20:06:26,TheGamePlayer,Same
09-04-2018T20:06:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Only got him in the stomach because I’m short and wasn’t really aiming
09-04-2018T20:07:09,TheGamePlayer,That's reasonable
09-04-2018T20:07:23,TheGamePlayer,I punched my friend in the face!
09-04-2018T20:08:12,Vatruvius,If you were any shorter...
09-04-2018T20:08:23,TheGamePlayer,Lol
09-04-2018T20:08:36,TheGamePlayer,That would hurt
09-04-2018T20:08:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah I see your point
09-04-2018T20:10:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t feel I punched too hard though - it was a knee jerk reaction
09-04-2018T20:10:10,TheGamePlayer,So there's 16 deer that we feed every day they walk into our yard and sit there far hours I've been lucky and pet one for a bit till it got startled by my dog
09-04-2018T20:10:37,Vatruvius,Agh...why am I so anxious! I do not have to do anything but I cannot seem to relax/stick to one thing. Worst day ever!
09-04-2018T20:10:54,TheGamePlayer,Same
09-04-2018T20:11:20,TheGamePlayer,Gtg byeeeeeeee!
09-04-2018T20:11:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"When I feel too restless, I usually end up cleaning my room"
09-04-2018T20:12:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Or repot a plant
09-04-2018T20:12:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Or cook
09-04-2018T20:12:57,Vatruvius,I started the day off really slow and depressed for no reason and now I am anxious and cannot relax. Cleaning does not work for me though...
09-04-2018T20:13:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Find a pet and talk their ear off
09-04-2018T20:14:28,Vatruvius,Actually...I know why I am anxious now except that gets into private territory so I will leave it there.
09-04-2018T20:15:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"As I’m no therapist, sure"
09-04-2018T20:16:28,SpazztasticKiwi,You could still rant to a pet though
09-04-2018T20:17:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Or a tree outside - they don’t gossip as far as I’ve learned
09-04-2018T20:17:26,Vatruvius,That won't work...my dog will just look at me and tilt her head waiting for attention/trying to look cute to get attention.
09-04-2018T20:18:22,Vatruvius,"The ""private"" business I was talking about is not gossip or anything."
09-04-2018T20:19:01,SpazztasticKiwi,It becomes gossip when someone you trusted to keep the info to themselves tells another
09-04-2018T20:19:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Pets and trees aren’t known to do that
09-04-2018T20:21:07,Vatruvius,Welll...then I guess it could become gossip but it would not be a really good peice of gossip so...no. I would rather stay inside anyway because it is cold and rainy outside.
09-04-2018T20:30:55,qwe304,"when book 4 comes out, will the online pages be updated at some point after, as was done when pages were redone in the past?"
09-04-2018T20:34:24,Vatruvius,Is Tom remastering the pages for the books?
09-04-2018T20:36:56,Flareuim,Idk maybe
09-04-2018T20:37:31,Vatruvius,That wjat qwe's comment sounds like.
09-04-2018T20:37:45,Vatruvius,is what*
09-04-2018T20:48:37,qwe304,"hes redoing some pages for book 4, unsure as to what extent"
09-04-2018T20:51:24,Vatruvius,Has he been redoing pages in the other books? Is thete a specific reason why he is redoing them?
09-04-2018T20:51:34,Vatruvius,there*
09-04-2018T20:52:32,qwe304,"the pages you see when viewing the comic online arent the originals, hes made several alterationsover the years,"
09-04-2018T20:53:25,qwe304,and we saw him make a new opening page and one more a while back
09-04-2018T20:53:47,Vatruvius,Okay...so he is not remastering the pages in these books to his current art style.
09-04-2018T20:54:39,qwe304,i dont think so
09-04-2018T20:54:52,qwe304,but he did redo 2
09-04-2018T20:55:21,Vatruvius,Nora Cards?
09-04-2018T20:55:31,qwe304,https://imgur.com/a/eotK1
09-04-2018T20:57:27,Vatruvius,I saw that stream...or the video anywsy. Tom said he created thst page to tie in the story because otherwise Book 4 started in a weird place.
09-04-2018T20:57:36,Vatruvius,anyway*
09-04-2018T20:58:11,Vatruvius,How many chapters are in a book?
09-04-2018T20:58:55,qwe304,"yup, and when reading descriptions hes been doing a lot of art as ""thanks"" to people for ""helping"" with book 4, :thinking:"
09-04-2018T21:00:33,Vatruvius,Oh yeah...I saw one of those.
09-04-2018T21:16:17,qwe304,"quite a few people have ""helped"" so I think there will be somthing new with it"
09-04-2018T21:20:03,Vatruvius,"Maybe a ""thank you"" section? I have not gotten any of the books but I am considering pre-ordering Book 4 and getting the others later."
09-04-2018T21:25:54,qwe304,im probably going to do somthing special when it comes out
09-04-2018T21:27:33,Vatruvius,"What...are you going the book out to a good dinner, glass of win, kiss goodbye at the book's doorstep?"
09-04-2018T21:27:45,Vatruvius,:ptv-tease:
09-04-2018T21:28:13,Vatruvius,Oh my god...this phone!
09-04-2018T21:28:29,Vatruvius,take the book out* wine*
09-04-2018T21:28:57,qwe304,"no, but somthing Ive done once before"
09-04-2018T21:29:11,qwe304,somthing people like
09-04-2018T21:29:37,Vatruvius,You got my attention.
09-04-2018T21:58:06,qwe304,well i dont want to spoil it
09-04-2018T22:02:51,Vatruvius,Fine...don't tell me!
09-04-2018T22:03:16,Vatruvius,procedes to cross his arms and turn his back to qwe.
09-04-2018T22:11:25,KaiZano,I wanna see Red haire Trace (Keidran or not)
09-04-2018T22:36:56,Vatruvius,A red hair Trace or Red and Trace? You have to elaborate for me to understand. :ptv-wondering:
09-04-2018T23:38:49,qwe304,@KaiZano red hair trace: https://imgur.com/a/AEMSE
09-04-2018T23:39:14,qwe304,it looks weird tbh
09-04-2018T23:39:52,Bgrmystr2,that's cuz his blue dorito is still blue.
09-04-2018T23:43:13,qwe304,https://imgur.com/a/URTNQ
09-04-2018T23:44:30,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: Image doesn't even appear
09-04-2018T23:45:56,qwe304,oof 1 sec
09-04-2018T23:46:10,qwe304,https://imgur.com/a/URTNQ works for me
09-04-2018T23:46:34,Bgrmystr2,blank for me. Doesn't load any image
09-04-2018T23:46:37,Bgrmystr2,:(
09-04-2018T23:48:00,qwe304,:thinking

09-04-2018T23:49:08,Bgrmystr2,ah that loaded
09-04-2018T23:49:14,Bgrmystr2,his blue dorito is still blue Dx
09-04-2018T23:49:32,Bgrmystr2,"doesn't look bad to me, really"
09-04-2018T23:49:51,qwe304,trace looks more feminine
09-04-2018T23:50:25,Bgrmystr2,hmm? Does it?
09-04-2018T23:50:59,Vatruvius,Yeah...the red hair does make him look more feminine.
09-04-2018T23:51:04,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: Dunno, guess I've seen too many guys and girls with off color hair for that to look strange to me."
09-04-2018T23:51:24,Bgrmystr2,it doesn't look any more or less feminine than the blue hair
09-04-2018T23:52:42,Vatruvius,I am rather new to the whole comic scene. I am not even into manga or anime so...he looks feminine to me.
09-04-2018T23:53:47,Bgrmystr2,"Guess you're just different, then. I've seen my share of feisty female redheads and him having that red hair just isn't applicable imo lol"
09-04-2018T23:54:07,Bgrmystr2,:v either way
09-04-2018T23:54:16,Bgrmystr2,definitely interesting
09-04-2018T23:54:19,qwe304,for me it just pushes him over the edge
09-04-2018T23:54:58,Vatruvius,You have seen your fair share of feisty female redheads...I will just jot that down on my notes for Bgr...okay...got it.
09-04-2018T23:56:30,NightMeaty22,ok...
09-04-2018T23:56:57,Bgrmystr2,lool vatru xD
09-04-2018T23:57:10,Bgrmystr2,it happens when you read a lot of manga and watch a lot of anime
09-04-2018T23:57:26,Bgrmystr2,and see a lot of people
09-04-2018T23:57:27,Vatruvius,Figured as much.
09-04-2018T23:57:43,Bgrmystr2,there's a lot out there
09-04-2018T23:58:01,Vatruvius,Redheads in general are not common where I live...but then again there are not a lot of people where I live relative to cities and such.
