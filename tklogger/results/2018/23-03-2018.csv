23-03-2018T00:00:07,unsteddyphoenix,Oof that panel 5 expression though.
23-03-2018T00:00:12,unsteddyphoenix,It's really like...scathing.
23-03-2018T00:00:19,Dadrobit,I like it
23-03-2018T00:00:21,Bgrmystr2,yeah she doesn't like him
23-03-2018T00:00:34,Dadrobit,That was kind of like the look Felicity gave me.
23-03-2018T00:00:42,unsteddyphoenix,It's very effective. I cant praise your expressions enough Tom.
23-03-2018T00:00:50,Ordithus,^
23-03-2018T00:01:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,rose is a little miff'd
23-03-2018T00:01:13,Combak,I'm not surprised.
23-03-2018T00:01:23,Ordithus,"lol that crack, Rose"
23-03-2018T00:01:25,Vatruvius,"Sketch idea: Rose, ""Oops, did I forget to mention Master Trace has to allow you to come in otherwise the estate's defenses kick in?"""
23-03-2018T00:01:26,Ordithus,nice
23-03-2018T00:01:41,Bgrmystr2,perfect transformation.. would probably overright the curse that Nora put on the house
23-03-2018T00:01:48,Bgrmystr2,because it's a fundamental part of his being
23-03-2018T00:01:53,ChatterboxFTW,Someone is getting hostile
23-03-2018T00:01:57,Bgrmystr2,while nora's curse is simply magic
23-03-2018T00:02:01,Bigboi182,"Rose is just straight savage, isn't she..."
23-03-2018T00:02:02,unsteddyphoenix,Lol she wants to free some of the uninvited guests huh? Interesting...
23-03-2018T00:02:05,Bgrmystr2,"very powerful magic, obviously, but still magic"
23-03-2018T00:02:20,Bgrmystr2,override* :C
23-03-2018T00:02:21,Dadrobit,Trolling unsteddy?
23-03-2018T00:02:33,Vatruvius,Nora actually performs the perfect transformation I do believe...what she did to Clovis was not an illusion was it?
23-03-2018T00:02:51,Bgrmystr2,that's not the same Vatru
23-03-2018T00:03:00,Bgrmystr2,What nora did was probably the same result
23-03-2018T00:03:06,Bgrmystr2,but not the same way of going about it
23-03-2018T00:03:08,Dadrobit,"Nora was more powerful than a mask though Vat, Apples to Nissan Sentras there"
23-03-2018T00:03:35,Bgrmystr2,more powerful than a mask?
23-03-2018T00:03:40,SageSaga,Unsteddy has permission to share a cool link

23-03-2018T00:04:09,Bgrmystr2,Better be from Legend of Zelda
23-03-2018T00:04:11,Vatruvius,"I know Nora is powerful, but what I am saying is what Nora did transforms the person, it is not an illusion."
23-03-2018T00:04:12,Dadrobit,I do recall an old discussion on the forums with Tom's input on it
23-03-2018T00:04:12,Bgrmystr2,or I'll be disappoint

23-03-2018T00:58:47,SageSaga,if you define manipulation as asking someone to do something- yes

23-03-2018T01:03:22,neropan,halp aa
23-03-2018T01:03:37,IMC,Like my friend
23-03-2018T01:03:38,unsteddyphoenix,"You know. Gaining popularity, ad revenue, the like."
23-03-2018T01:03:52,ChatterboxFTW,No one likes the imc Marvin is the better faction
23-03-2018T01:04:03,unsteddyphoenix,Nero stay strong
23-03-2018T01:04:04,unsteddyphoenix,You can DO it
23-03-2018T01:04:29,Dadrobit,Is making money really an ulterior motive?
23-03-2018T01:04:36,IMC,What are you talking about the IMC is clearly serving humanity’s best interests!
23-03-2018T01:04:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Nero is not on the user list, I cry"
23-03-2018T01:04:54,TomFurson,Well I am going to hit the sack so gu night
23-03-2018T01:05:03,Dadrobit,"Like, unless you're passing it off as a passion project, I assume the desire is to make money for most things that people do."
23-03-2018T01:05:08,IMC,Besides my name is an accident
23-03-2018T01:05:11,ChatterboxFTW,Marvin is better I will say no more on the subject
23-03-2018T01:05:16,SageSaga,popularity is not an ulterior motive- it goes without saying a an ad for a comic is trying to increase popularity
23-03-2018T01:05:23,unsteddyphoenix,"Well the face value of that particular statement is ""Im helping you out by recommending you more things you may like"""
23-03-2018T01:05:35,neropan,you're tearing me apart internet provider
23-03-2018T01:05:40,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
23-03-2018T01:05:42,IMC,Fine I agree to disagree
23-03-2018T01:05:52,Dadrobit,"I'd call it a secondary motive more than ""Ulterior"""
23-03-2018T01:06:14,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah thats what I mean sage, the viewer already knows that's what the artist wants. There's noone getting deceived or anything."
23-03-2018T01:06:24,SageSaga,i disagree
23-03-2018T01:06:27,neropan,oke third tiem its the charm
23-03-2018T01:06:33,unsteddyphoenix,Lets go Nero~
23-03-2018T01:06:38,ZRO4825,Of course it's a motive. Why would it NOT be a motive? o.o; Especially if you're making a living off of it!
23-03-2018T01:06:42,neropan,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e62M-5-7ajY
23-03-2018T01:06:48,SageSaga,ulterior means you intentionally hide it- i dont think it is hidden at all
23-03-2018T01:06:52,ChatterboxFTW,Or it is a matter of everyone needs money but there are ways that it seems like something others don’t want
23-03-2018T01:07:06,IMC,Well I f***ed up I just smashed my computer on the ground.
23-03-2018T01:07:12,Dadrobit,"Nero, thank you. Sincerely."
23-03-2018T01:07:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,almost four minutes of grunting 0_0
23-03-2018T01:07:16,ZRO4825,Good job~
23-03-2018T01:07:27,w0lfmare,"I like to think that artists have a right, maybe even an obligation to seek an audience of people who enjoy their work."
23-03-2018T01:07:28,unsteddyphoenix,Nero good stuff
23-03-2018T01:07:29,ChatterboxFTW,NERO WHY
23-03-2018T01:07:44,Dadrobit,This is now my ring tone
23-03-2018T01:07:52,IMC,W0lfmare that’s called capitalism
23-03-2018T01:08:10,w0lfmare,"Afterall, the end goal is a win/win"
23-03-2018T01:08:16,SageSaga,i dont think that is capitalism
23-03-2018T01:08:22,IMC,Why?
23-03-2018T01:08:59,SageSaga,because it doesnt mean it is done for profit
23-03-2018T01:09:09,neropan,oke stream working again
23-03-2018T01:09:10,neropan,woof
23-03-2018T01:09:15,unsteddyphoenix,bork
23-03-2018T01:09:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,WooHoo \o/
23-03-2018T01:09:23,ChatterboxFTW,Capitalism is the growth of economy through the process of making better products to gain profit
23-03-2018T01:09:30,IMC,"That’s the premise, to compete for consumers."
23-03-2018T01:09:33,ChatterboxFTW,Basically
23-03-2018T01:10:20,SageSaga,i dont think yall understand - a single consumer can consume many artistic works without any cost
23-03-2018T01:10:44,unsteddyphoenix,"That's true. Unless you count ""time"" as a cost"
23-03-2018T01:11:07,IMC,Yeah but that’s still a consumer
23-03-2018T01:11:24,ChatterboxFTW,Or the devices they use to view the works
23-03-2018T01:11:52,w0lfmare,Time don't count
23-03-2018T01:12:17,IMC,Well in the future for my country I bet they’ll do away with capitalism...
23-03-2018T01:12:32,unsteddyphoenix,:clock12::clock1230::clock1::clock8:
23-03-2018T01:12:33,IMC,I can sense it
23-03-2018T01:12:52,SageSaga,capitalism is defined as an economic system - im saying art can be consumed without economic costs
23-03-2018T01:13:39,IMC,Hmm you do make a good argument but fighting for consumers is still a capitalist way
23-03-2018T01:14:06,ChatterboxFTW,Power internet
23-03-2018T01:14:18,IMC,Brb something just broke
23-03-2018T01:14:20,SageSaga,only if you define them as consumers does it sound that way
23-03-2018T01:15:38,SageSaga,"a person that goes out and eats a fruit off of a wild tree might have consumed the fruit making him a ""Consumer"" but that doesnt make it Capitalism"
23-03-2018T01:16:07,IMC,Back I’ll fix it later in the meantime the floor is now brocken
23-03-2018T01:16:17,IMC,Broken

23-03-2018T16:56:49,Twokinds,Only Raine has pads on her hands
23-03-2018T16:57:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,she must be amazing on the monkey bars
23-03-2018T16:58:17,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
23-03-2018T16:58:33,Whitestripes,Huh. She is special
23-03-2018T16:58:39,Darkdragoon,i think raine is cute~
23-03-2018T16:59:54,Legoboy71617,If Raine is the only character that has pads on their hands then maybe it is because she can transform
23-03-2018T16:59:57,qwe304,but sometimes she doesn't...  https://twokinds.deviantart.com/art/Raine-Dances-708122765
23-03-2018T17:00:13,Legoboy71617,True
23-03-2018T17:00:19,qwe304,:thinking:
23-03-2018T17:00:26,NeonMitsumi,Glitch in the matrix
23-03-2018T17:00:28,Twokinds,Sometimes I forget
23-03-2018T17:00:30,qwe304,whatevs raine is just a derp
23-03-2018T17:01:09,Whitestripes,A fabulous derp
23-03-2018T17:01:53,qwe304,I'll remember to remind you if i see you forget them again.
23-03-2018T17:02:08,MildSauce,Hey tom what cons are u going to this year
23-03-2018T17:02:27,qwe304,he usually goes to SDcc
23-03-2018T17:02:57,Twokinds,I have a table at SDCC and possibly anthrocon
23-03-2018T17:03:46,NeonMitsumi,Oh boy
23-03-2018T17:04:42,MuonNeutrino,hm. so what is a '2018 signature print'?
23-03-2018T17:04:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe she doesn’t always fully transform and that’s why there’s sometimes pads and other times they’re absent
23-03-2018T17:05:07,Whitestripes,I worked at SDCC last year
23-03-2018T17:05:10,MildSauce,So does this mean this Prince only going to be available physically
23-03-2018T17:05:10,NeonMitsumi,A follow up to 2017 signature print.
23-03-2018T17:05:11,Twokinds,"It's a print, that I signature in 2018"
23-03-2018T17:05:12,Whitestripes,It was great
23-03-2018T17:05:22,MildSauce,Print
23-03-2018T17:05:30,Twokinds,"Prints are usually physical, yes"
23-03-2018T17:05:30,MuonNeutrino,"given the conversation, something you're going to sell at a con or something?"
23-03-2018T17:05:34,MuonNeutrino,neat
23-03-2018T17:06:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Well I’m out folks✌🏻
23-03-2018T17:06:12,Whitestripes,Seeya Spazz
23-03-2018T17:06:43,GameForge,"odam, some good posters"
23-03-2018T17:06:49,BrunoYcaro,nice katty
23-03-2018T17:06:53,MuonNeutrino,nice
23-03-2018T17:07:04,MuonNeutrino,i sense a theme here =)
23-03-2018T17:07:09,NeonMitsumi,Ayyyyyyy &lt;3
23-03-2018T17:07:21,NeonMitsumi,I remember that one.
23-03-2018T17:07:33,Twokinds,I like to have something small that someone can get at a con that doesn't cost as much as a book
23-03-2018T17:07:37,Twokinds,But is still something to have
23-03-2018T17:07:45,Twokinds,"So the prints are $5, I sign them."
23-03-2018T17:07:51,GameForge,"oh, nice"
23-03-2018T17:07:53,MuonNeutrino,"yeah, that makes sense"
23-03-2018T17:07:58,MuonNeutrino,i'd totally buy a 5$ print
23-03-2018T17:08:19,Twokinds,I do one every year
23-03-2018T17:08:27,Whitestripes,"Maybe if I go to SDCC this year, I'll stop by and get a book from you"
23-03-2018T17:08:53,MuonNeutrino,"i'd especially buy this one, so cute &lt;3"
23-03-2018T17:09:16,Twokinds,"This year will be the first time any of them are available online, as Raine will be bundled with Vol 4 preorders. ... maybe"
23-03-2018T17:09:23,Twokinds,If arraignments with Keenspot are settled
23-03-2018T17:09:24,NeonMitsumi,"Wait, signature prints are only $5? Oh snep"
23-03-2018T17:09:44,Whitestripes,I'll definitely get a signed print
23-03-2018T17:11:40,Twokinds,Raine is too floofy
23-03-2018T17:11:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lies
23-03-2018T17:12:12,NeonMitsumi,:cneonmitsumi-floof: Excuse you?
23-03-2018T17:12:15,Whitestripes,"There is no such thing as ""too floofy"""
23-03-2018T17:12:34,Twokinds,"I wonder if, when Raine sheds, and then turns back... does the shed fur disappear?"
23-03-2018T17:12:39,Twokinds,Does it stay?
23-03-2018T17:12:49,totallynotTrace,#deep
23-03-2018T17:12:52,Whitestripes,I would assume so
23-03-2018T17:13:08,Whitestripes,If its not attached to the object that is transforming
23-03-2018T17:13:19,InTheLionsDen,Once it is off her body it is probably detached from the magic and would remain.
23-03-2018T17:13:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"no shed, she just keeps getting floofier"
23-03-2018T17:14:18,Bgrmystr2,"well.. the fur isn't part of her anymore, it's on the floor"
23-03-2018T17:14:24,Bgrmystr2,so I'd expect the fur to stay if she sheds
23-03-2018T17:14:28,Bgrmystr2,even if she turns back human
23-03-2018T17:14:56,Tylertt,But the fur probably wouldn't have been there in the first place if it wasn't for the magic
23-03-2018T17:15:18,Bgrmystr2,the magic only changes her body
23-03-2018T17:15:21,Twokinds,"When Raine's cut as a wolf, the injury goes away when she's human and comes back when she returns to wolf form."
23-03-2018T17:15:23,Bgrmystr2,not everything around her lol
23-03-2018T17:15:38,Bgrmystr2,cuts also part of her body lol
23-03-2018T17:15:54,Bgrmystr2,or at least.. afflicted to it.
23-03-2018T17:15:54,Whitestripes,"So... When she os fatally stabbed as a wolf, she just need to turn back into a human?"
23-03-2018T17:16:00,Bgrmystr2,uh..
23-03-2018T17:16:00,Whitestripes,Is*
23-03-2018T17:16:01,Bgrmystr2,yes.
23-03-2018T17:16:04,Bgrmystr2,till she turns wolf
23-03-2018T17:16:06,Bgrmystr2,then she dies
23-03-2018T17:16:13,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering:
23-03-2018T17:16:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"human raine = player 1, wolf raine = player 2"
23-03-2018T17:16:28,Twokinds,"The question is, would the wound be healed more by the time she's spent as a human?"
23-03-2018T17:16:35,Twokinds,Or would it be the same amount as it was when she changed back
23-03-2018T17:16:41,HotCocoa,how about like the hulk
23-03-2018T17:16:41,Bgrmystr2,uh..:thinking:
23-03-2018T17:16:46,HotCocoa,every time he transforms he heals instantly
23-03-2018T17:16:50,Whitestripes,Well it depends if the wolf state is time locked
23-03-2018T17:16:55,HotCocoa,hulk to human or human to hulk
23-03-2018T17:16:58,Bgrmystr2,I'd expect it to be the same but..
23-03-2018T17:17:03,HotCocoa,any injury he sustains is gone
23-03-2018T17:17:07,Bgrmystr2,I don't know if the magic allows healing in-between
23-03-2018T17:17:35,Bgrmystr2,"Also, Cocoa that'd be op"
23-03-2018T17:17:36,Twokinds,Hulk's not really a fair comparison though
23-03-2018T17:17:57,Twokinds,Hulk is Hulk. Injuries aren't really too much of a problem for him.
23-03-2018T17:18:11,Bgrmystr2,yeah he's kind of tough
23-03-2018T17:18:14,Tylertt,"also, not the same universe"
23-03-2018T17:18:17,Bgrmystr2,by a little bit
23-03-2018T17:18:28,Tylertt,so not same physics
23-03-2018T17:18:37,qwe304,"i think they should heal, slowly (like normal) regardless of the form the injust happened or which form shes taking, easier to remember that way too."
23-03-2018T17:18:56,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, I think the opposite"
23-03-2018T17:18:59,Whitestripes,So the magic would have to do the healing
23-03-2018T17:19:03,MuonNeutrino,i was kinda wondering why she didn't have the cut anymore in the most recent pages
23-03-2018T17:19:06,MuonNeutrino,makes sense tho
23-03-2018T17:19:13,Bgrmystr2,that would require magic to heal as well
23-03-2018T17:19:17,Bgrmystr2,and we don't know if it does
23-03-2018T17:19:19,Whitestripes,"Other wise, otherwise the wolf form would bleed to death"
23-03-2018T17:19:20,HotCocoa,bounce bounce bounce
23-03-2018T17:19:20,InTheLionsDen,:ctwokinds-florajiggle:
23-03-2018T17:19:24,Bgrmystr2,"it's simply transformation magic, not healing magic."
23-03-2018T17:19:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,BOUNCE!!!!! :ctwokinds-florajiggle::ctwokinds-RaineEep::ctwokinds-florajiggle:
23-03-2018T17:19:35,Whitestripes,Bounce!
23-03-2018T17:19:45,MuonNeutrino,although.... she didn't seem to think it worked that way here
23-03-2018T17:19:46,MuonNeutrino,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/948/
23-03-2018T17:19:51,MuonNeutrino,though she might just have been mistaken
23-03-2018T17:20:10,Twokinds,Well she wouldn't really know
23-03-2018T17:20:14,Bgrmystr2,characters are not always right :v
23-03-2018T17:21:16,MuonNeutrino,hence my caveat ^^
23-03-2018T17:21:19,Twokinds,"Actually she would. She did change back partially, so maybe I'm the one that's wrong. XD"
23-03-2018T17:21:27,MuonNeutrino,yeah was just going to ask about that actually
23-03-2018T17:21:35,MuonNeutrino,"she did change partially back, would have thought she'd have noticed"
23-03-2018T17:21:41,Whitestripes,"Well, cant always stay consistent"
23-03-2018T17:21:54,Twokinds,"So injuries do remain, I suppose"
23-03-2018T17:21:57,MuonNeutrino,"well, as long as you don't outright say it in the comic you don't have to tie yourself down ^^"
23-03-2018T17:22:09,Bgrmystr2,"Tom, it's possible that any partial transformations retain injuries"
23-03-2018T17:22:13,Bgrmystr2,but full transformations do not?
23-03-2018T17:22:30,MuonNeutrino,though in that case her lack of a scar/injury in the more recent pages would be puzzling &gt;.&gt;
23-03-2018T17:22:36,Bgrmystr2,but would that mean a partial transformation would have injuries of both human and wolf form?
23-03-2018T17:22:39,Bgrmystr2,that's dangerous lol
23-03-2018T17:22:43,Char89TheCharizard,hey guys.
23-03-2018T17:22:48,Whitestripes,Be right back.
23-03-2018T17:22:56,Twokinds,Does food stay in her stomach when she changes?
23-03-2018T17:22:57,Grishmark,Hi all
23-03-2018T17:22:58,Bgrmystr2,hey Char
23-03-2018T17:23:01,Bgrmystr2,LOL Tom
23-03-2018T17:23:06,Bgrmystr2,obviously not
23-03-2018T17:23:09,JDH,only tacos
23-03-2018T17:23:09,Twokinds,If she ate a bunch of bread and then changed into a wolf would she get sick?
23-03-2018T17:23:12,Bgrmystr2,"after she changes, she is IMMEDIATELY hungry"
23-03-2018T17:23:13,qwe304,"tom, these are the questoins WE are sposed to ask!"
23-03-2018T17:23:26,Bgrmystr2,We're not asking tho
23-03-2018T17:23:30,Bgrmystr2,which is why tom has to ask for us
23-03-2018T17:23:34,Tylertt,I think we're delving a bit too deep now
23-03-2018T17:23:35,Bgrmystr2,SOMEONE has to
23-03-2018T17:23:36,Char89TheCharizard,Let's not think about it Tom
23-03-2018T17:23:41,Twokinds,lol
23-03-2018T17:23:45,MviluUatusun,"Since I missed the beginning of this drawing, who is that that Raine is holding?"
23-03-2018T17:23:49,Twokinds,Well it's not like I've thought of EVERYTHING
23-03-2018T17:23:57,MuonNeutrino,would bread make wolves sick? they're not as obligate carnivores as cats are
23-03-2018T17:23:58,Twokinds,Raine is holding Raine
23-03-2018T17:24:05,InTheLionsDen,Holding her tail.
23-03-2018T17:24:09,MuonNeutrino,she's cuddling her tail
23-03-2018T17:24:15,MuonNeutrino,because floof &lt;3
23-03-2018T17:24:17,MviluUatusun,"Do whut?  I definitely missed something here, Tom."
23-03-2018T17:24:24,Twokinds,Well bread doesn't really hurt adult Keidran that much
23-03-2018T17:24:29,Twokinds,But too much of anything isn't good
23-03-2018T17:24:31,JDH,"tom, you are the master and commander!...."
23-03-2018T17:24:38,Bgrmystr2,something something chocolate..?
23-03-2018T17:24:51,Bgrmystr2,or would that not be applicable because she's human-sized?
23-03-2018T17:25:18,qwe304,"chocolate can be lethal for humans too, its just you have to eat like 20 lbs"
23-03-2018T17:25:22,Twokinds,They probably can't handle as much chocolate as a human
23-03-2018T17:25:30,Whitestripes,Back
23-03-2018T17:25:31,MuonNeutrino,"iirc in real life canines can handle plant matter better than felines can, i think, though ofc that doesn't necessarily translate to the TK world"
23-03-2018T17:25:32,MviluUatusun,"Oh, I see now, Muon.  Thanks for pointing that out to me.  (poking temple)  Du-uh."
23-03-2018T17:25:35,Seanie,Hiya
23-03-2018T17:25:37,Twokinds,But they are a lot more massive than your average cat or dog
23-03-2018T17:25:42,Twokinds,So they could eat some fine
23-03-2018T17:25:46,Bgrmystr2,Yeah I figured
23-03-2018T17:25:51,JDH,well we know they cant handle booze that well
23-03-2018T17:25:54,Bgrmystr2,"cuz far as I'm aware, it's based off body mass"
23-03-2018T17:25:59,Bgrmystr2,or something of that sort
23-03-2018T17:26:07,MviluUatusun,BRB.
23-03-2018T17:26:34,totallynotTrace,ability to digest chocolate is not exclusive to body mass
23-03-2018T17:27:48,TheBeckoner,oh lookit a stream
23-03-2018T17:28:00,totallynotTrace,a 75 lb child can eat considerably more chocolate than a 75 lb dog
23-03-2018T17:28:07,JDH,neighbors growing up had a rotwiller (spelling?) for like 14 years and it had a snicker bar like every other day
23-03-2018T17:28:40,totallynotTrace,@jdh thats not healthy
23-03-2018T17:28:43,JDH,but it was a highly active dog so...idk i know chocolate is not good
23-03-2018T17:29:11,Bgrmystr2,it's the way their body handles the cocoa because it's not good at breaking it down
23-03-2018T17:29:30,totallynotTrace,basicly yeah
23-03-2018T17:29:31,MuonNeutrino,toxicity depends both on the substance and body mass
23-03-2018T17:29:48,MuonNeutrino,"a human-mass dog would be able to handle more chocolate than a small dog, but less than a humal"
23-03-2018T17:29:51,MuonNeutrino,*human
23-03-2018T17:30:09,JDH,"well, im not saying it was right but those dogs only live 10 ish years and they got 14..."
23-03-2018T17:30:11,Bgrmystr2,Someone already did the math
23-03-2018T17:30:15,Bgrmystr2,"""The toxic dose of theobromine is 100+ mg/kg of body weight and chocolate bars usually contain 100-500 mg theobromine/100 g"""
23-03-2018T17:30:23,MuonNeutrino,"does chocolate exist in the twokinds world, i wonder? XD"
23-03-2018T17:30:40,totallynotTrace,I have a college friend that cannot digest chocolate
23-03-2018T17:30:49,TheBeckoner,Also most chocolate a pet would encounter doesn't have much cocoa. Most candy chocolate doesnt
23-03-2018T17:30:53,MuonNeutrino,"yeah i looked those up a while ago for a post on the forums trying to figure out exactly what the lethal dose would be for a keidran, but i dont remember the numbers"
23-03-2018T17:31:05,JDH,i like chocolate but it dont love me...
23-03-2018T17:31:11,Whitestripes,Are we still talking about chocolate XD
23-03-2018T17:31:15,totallynotTrace,yes
23-03-2018T17:31:16,Bgrmystr2,"Why not, stripes?"
23-03-2018T17:31:51,Whitestripes,Nothing. Chocolate is good
23-03-2018T17:32:18,JDH,isnt pure chacolate actually good for you?
23-03-2018T17:32:25,Tylertt,yes I think
23-03-2018T17:32:38,qwe304,"lethal theobromine dose for dogs is 1,000mg/Kg"
23-03-2018T17:32:40,MuonNeutrino,"in moderation, probably"
23-03-2018T17:32:45,qwe304,so scale that up
23-03-2018T17:32:52,MuonNeutrino,isnt it an antioxidant or something?
23-03-2018T17:33:29,totallynotTrace,chocolate is amazing. Dogs think so also. They just mentally cannot connect the fact that it could kill them.
23-03-2018T17:33:49,qwe304,so a lethal dose of dark chocolate for a dog would be 1/14th its body weight
23-03-2018T17:34:50,qwe304,i think i remember tom saying at some point that keidran are heavier than they look... :thinking:
23-03-2018T17:35:08,InTheLionsDen,Twokinds chocolate is produced by special Keidran bunnies one time a year in the form of eggs and is non toxic to other Keidran. Humans on the other hand...
23-03-2018T17:35:31,Bgrmystr2,would still eat.
23-03-2018T17:35:34,Bgrmystr2,cuz chocolate.
23-03-2018T17:35:39,Tylertt,same
23-03-2018T17:35:41,totallynotTrace,"so yesterday it was grilled cheese war, today its the great chocolate debate?"
23-03-2018T17:36:11,Tylertt,wait a grilled cheese war?! YESTERDAY?!
23-03-2018T17:36:20,totallynotTrace,yeah
23-03-2018T17:36:30,JDH,"i have fed my dog  peices of chacolate cookie before, he is 12, i also dont give the whole thing and most the time im like yeah keep begging cause this is dope and you aint getting none lol"
23-03-2018T17:36:50,JDH,very rare

23-03-2018T18:32:24,CrRAR,the OMINOUS is building
23-03-2018T18:32:29,MuonNeutrino,you just KNOW he's ~plotting~ and ~scheming~ something
23-03-2018T18:32:31,Babbles,hi
23-03-2018T18:32:31,CrRAR,"First Clovis, now Euchre"

23-03-2018T18:32:43,Bgrmystr2,"don't see anything ominous about him being there, Muon lol"
23-03-2018T18:32:50,kts,"i discovered twokinds about a year ago, it makes me want to try a drawing course"
23-03-2018T18:32:53,Bgrmystr2,"not yet, anyway"
23-03-2018T18:32:56,Tylertt,"that's got me thinking... if she changes back while in the mansion, would the curse still count her as Raine or an intruder?"
23-03-2018T18:33:03,Tylertt,also late message
23-03-2018T18:33:04,Bgrmystr2,she's still raine
23-03-2018T18:33:08,ZahnHolley,Raines very beautiful tom
23-03-2018T18:33:13,MuonNeutrino,"because he's always scheming, so if he's around it means whatever he's doing is focusing on something around here"
23-03-2018T18:33:29,MuonNeutrino,which is automatically suspicious &gt;.&gt;
23-03-2018T18:33:37,Ghaulantis,honestly my favorite character has always been kathrin
