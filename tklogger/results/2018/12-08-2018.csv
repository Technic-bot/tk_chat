12-08-2018T00:01:10,TorqueEmUp,Not to mention being a HBG user kinda means I need to have others to take the attention off of me.
12-08-2018T00:01:58,unsteddyphoenix,Protect the carry~
12-08-2018T00:02:34,TorqueEmUp,Pierce rounds are my bread and butter. lol
12-08-2018T00:11:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Scheduling with friends: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm off weekends. You?‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm off weekdays‚Äù
12-08-2018T00:13:32,unsteddyphoenix,Except for me it was like
12-08-2018T00:13:58,unsteddyphoenix,"""We stayed up until 4am to play this game, then slept from 10am-2pm, lets play together!"""
12-08-2018T00:14:10,unsteddyphoenix,Sorry *buy this game
12-08-2018T00:23:34,Dadrobit,"Yeah, that was me. Actually hit up the midnight release for it. Haven't done that since Skyrim. But the local GameStop was releasing it a day early, so I wasn't gonna pass that up lol."
12-08-2018T00:24:17,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz: Good nighzzzzzzzzz
12-08-2018T00:24:47,unsteddyphoenix,'night~
12-08-2018T00:25:03,unsteddyphoenix,"Well this is NZ, so we get 4am releases :T"
12-08-2018T00:26:47,TorqueEmUp,"As the years go by, I find myself less and less excited about games."
12-08-2018T00:27:07,TorqueEmUp,I can't even remember the last midnight release I went to.
12-08-2018T00:28:22,Dadrobit,o/ Ord
12-08-2018T00:28:51,Dadrobit,"Truth be told, they just gave out the games at 10pm, no one there wanted to stay till midnight."
12-08-2018T00:29:28,unsteddyphoenix,hahaha nice~
12-08-2018T00:30:12,TorqueEmUp,"My local Gamestop is in a Mall, so midnight releases are very uncommon, since they have to pay mall security to let people be in the mall after closing."
12-08-2018T00:30:24,TorqueEmUp,so only extremely big releases
12-08-2018T00:34:11,TorqueEmUp,I don't do Gamestop anymore anyway. I get games cheaper at Best Buy through their now defunct Gamer's Club thing where new games are 20% off.
12-08-2018T00:45:11,Dadrobit,"I have a weird loyalty to my local stores, including the GameStop. Even though I only go in there maybe 2-3 times a year, they know me by name and it's nice to chew the fat with the folks that work there. Largely the same staff for over a decade now."
12-08-2018T00:46:45,Dadrobit,"Same for my local grocery store. I've been going there literally my whole life. It's a little more expensive than Wal Mart, but I enjoy talking with the cashiers, and the managers and whoever really is there when I go."
12-08-2018T00:50:45,unsteddyphoenix,Sometimes you wanna go
12-08-2018T00:50:54,unsteddyphoenix,*[where everybody knows your name~]
12-08-2018T00:51:44,Dadrobit,I feel like that's a song?
12-08-2018T00:51:47,SpazztasticKiwi,My local McDonald‚Äôs knows me by sight
12-08-2018T00:51:59,unsteddyphoenix,And you're always glad you came~
12-08-2018T00:52:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"Used to work there, but most of who worked with me have left"
12-08-2018T00:52:13,unsteddyphoenix,Youre probably all too young for that show
12-08-2018T00:52:46,SpazztasticKiwi,We‚Äôre all in our twenties
12-08-2018T00:52:54,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah there's a resteraunt/bar that my friends and I frequent and they all know us
12-08-2018T00:53:09,unsteddyphoenix,"So much that they even notice when one of us like, gets a haircut"
12-08-2018T00:53:31,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄòCept ol ‚ÄúJust turned the ripe ol age of 31‚Äù lurking in the shadows
12-08-2018T00:55:15,unsteddyphoenix,as far as I know he watched exclusively star wars and anime growing up though.
12-08-2018T00:55:22,SpazztasticKiwi,üë¥
12-08-2018T00:55:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I watched more anime when I was in my teens than I do now
12-08-2018T00:56:23,Bgrmystr2,"30, thank you very much Kiwi"
12-08-2018T00:56:34,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-pouty:
12-08-2018T00:56:35,Dadrobit,"I watched a fair amount of anime as a kid, yeah."
12-08-2018T00:56:42,SpazztasticKiwi,But you‚Äôre young at heart!
12-08-2018T00:56:51,Bgrmystr2,I am tho :v
12-08-2018T00:56:58,Dadrobit,Even joined an anime club in high school for two weeks before I had to get out.
12-08-2018T00:57:08,SpazztasticKiwi,And I was talking about Tom. He‚Äôs üë¥
12-08-2018T00:57:11,unsteddyphoenix,lmao

12-08-2018T00:57:40,Bgrmystr2,yes phoenix you are
12-08-2018T00:57:49,Bgrmystr2,but you'll have learned a lot by then
12-08-2018T00:57:51,Bgrmystr2,probably..
12-08-2018T00:58:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Well every time I say 30s aren‚Äôt old someone says otherwise so I‚Äôve decided to say it is old so people disagree
12-08-2018T00:58:07,unsteddyphoenix,basless conjecture
12-08-2018T00:58:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Reverse psychology
12-08-2018T00:58:17,unsteddyphoenix,You got me
12-08-2018T00:58:22,Dadrobit,"I was like, ""cool, people to talk about this common interest with!"" and they were like ""Naruto is so good, I'm gonna be a ninja too when I grow up!"""
12-08-2018T00:58:23,unsteddyphoenix,30? basicallya newborn
12-08-2018T00:58:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah. Don‚Äôt worry about wrinkles till you‚Äôre 40
12-08-2018T00:58:52,Bgrmystr2,xD Dadro
12-08-2018T00:58:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Hehe jokes
12-08-2018T00:59:01,unsteddyphoenix,The trick is to just force your friends into watching what you like
12-08-2018T00:59:07,unsteddyphoenix,And then talk about it
12-08-2018T00:59:09,Bgrmystr2,not sure if anime club at that point
12-08-2018T00:59:10,unsteddyphoenix,It's simple really
12-08-2018T00:59:17,Dadrobit,Neo Yokio and Elfen Lied
12-08-2018T00:59:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I did watch Naruto
12-08-2018T00:59:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"Stopped before the newest stuff came out, i.e. the end"
12-08-2018T01:00:02,unsteddyphoenix,Same
12-08-2018T01:00:10,SpazztasticKiwi,But you better believe I finished Inuyasha
12-08-2018T01:00:18,unsteddyphoenix,I stuck with it for nostalgia but at some point I couldnt take it anymore
12-08-2018T01:00:24,Dadrobit,"I like manga and anime, but I can't stand hardcore weebs tbh."
12-08-2018T01:01:10,unsteddyphoenix,"I mean, it's hard to stand hardcore anything"
12-08-2018T01:01:14,unsteddyphoenix,Especially weebs
12-08-2018T01:01:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"Inuyasha was a trip. His half demon brother hated him, he cut off his left arm for a sword he felt their father should‚Äôve left to him and not ‚Äúthe half breed‚Äù"
12-08-2018T01:01:36,Dadrobit,I think I read most or all of Inuyasha. Did read all of Death Note. Read a shitload of Bleach.
12-08-2018T01:01:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Guys sometimes looked like girls and vise versa
12-08-2018T01:01:48,Bgrmystr2,"back in school we called ppl like that cartoon network junkies, cuz that's all they knew was what came on there and thought it was the best shit ever."
12-08-2018T01:01:57,unsteddyphoenix,Theres a japanese voice actor that gets a lot of roles because his voice is androgenous
12-08-2018T01:02:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Sesshomaru was a killjoy
12-08-2018T01:02:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Hot one tho
12-08-2018T01:02:33,Dadrobit,Read all of Chobits. That was one of my first actually.
12-08-2018T01:02:42,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I watched adult swim and stuff like that, but even I watched Anime Unleashed and a few other things"
12-08-2018T01:03:22,SpazztasticKiwi,The ships were real. Insanity
12-08-2018T01:03:23,Bgrmystr2,"they aired Dirty Pair, on Showtime Beyond back in the mid 2000s"
12-08-2018T01:03:37,Bgrmystr2,and I watched Armitage III
12-08-2018T01:03:41,Bgrmystr2,both Dual and Poly-matrix
12-08-2018T01:03:49,Bgrmystr2,both on movie channels as well
12-08-2018T01:04:01,Dadrobit,"I wanted to get into anime through Adult Swim, but I only had access to a TV at my egg donor's house, and I was only there every other weekend."
12-08-2018T01:04:02,unsteddyphoenix,See I just read the mangos
12-08-2018T01:04:05,Bgrmystr2,"there was plenty of stuff to watch back then, so I got to benefit"
12-08-2018T01:04:11,unsteddyphoenix,'cause we didnt have that stuff and our internet wasnt great
12-08-2018T01:05:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"It must be late cause I read ‚Äúegg doner‚Äù, I immediately thought of a chicken üêì"
12-08-2018T01:05:34,Dadrobit,I fondly recall watching FLCL for the first time with my older brother who had borrowed the VHS tapes of it form his friend that recorded it.
12-08-2018T01:06:11,Dadrobit,"Nah, lol. Bio-mom. She's a piece of shit."
12-08-2018T01:06:23,SpazztasticKiwi,So
12-08-2018T01:06:29,SpazztasticKiwi,A hen basically
12-08-2018T01:06:41,unsteddyphoenix,Rude to hens tbh
12-08-2018T01:06:53,SpazztasticKiwi,üêî
12-08-2018T01:07:00,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúHow dare you‚Äù
12-08-2018T01:07:04,Dadrobit,Very rude tbh. I've lived with hens. They are far better animals.
12-08-2018T01:07:29,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs people with snuggly pet chickens that like hugs
12-08-2018T01:07:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Baby button quail are downright precious
12-08-2018T01:08:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Baby animals are :ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:
12-08-2018T01:09:49,Dadrobit,"IIRC, Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind. It was marked as a kid's movie at the library, and I managed to annoy my father enough to loan it out. Best annoyance ever."
12-08-2018T01:10:06,Dadrobit,Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind was my first anime*
12-08-2018T01:10:53,unsteddyphoenix,It wasnt like
12-08-2018T01:11:00,unsteddyphoenix,Pokemon or dbz or something?
12-08-2018T01:12:36,Dadrobit,"Nah, I was super young. And I watched Nickelodeon when I was that age. Didn't have those."
12-08-2018T01:14:03,unsteddyphoenix,Huh. That's basically all that was on tv for me at the time
12-08-2018T01:14:33,unsteddyphoenix,"Pokemon, X early 2000's music video, dbz, 90's music video, yugioh"
12-08-2018T01:14:44,unsteddyphoenix,good times~
12-08-2018T01:15:12,Dadrobit,"It was before I really even had access to TV. My folks were still together, and my father hated (and hates) TV. So we just watched movies every once in a while."
12-08-2018T01:15:26,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh I see
12-08-2018T01:17:30,Bgrmystr2,"I know that feel dadro. We had dish network back in the 90s before moving to Louisiana, and we didn't have any channels that had anime"
12-08-2018T01:17:37,Bgrmystr2,"no cartoon network, no pokemon, none of that"
12-08-2018T01:20:27,Dadrobit,"Kind of a weird/sad memory. But I recall during 9/11 when I got sent home from school early, I had no idea what was going on but my father's girlfriend had the TV on the news and I got into an argument with her about house rules of: No TV on the weekdays."
12-08-2018T01:21:18,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
12-08-2018T01:21:20,unsteddyphoenix,Funny and sad
12-08-2018T01:21:32,Dadrobit,"She was a bit of a crazy bitch, and we really didn't get along besides, but I do feel a bit bad about it now."
12-08-2018T01:22:00,unsteddyphoenix,"I remember hearing about it at school, but I had no idea what it meant at the time"
12-08-2018T01:23:20,Dadrobit,"Same. No one told the kids what was going on. I remember the teacher getting a phone call, and then we were just all sent home for seemingly no reason."
12-08-2018T01:23:53,Bgrmystr2,I think 9/11 is a fairly important thing to know about.. rules be damned
12-08-2018T01:24:05,Bgrmystr2,it's news
12-08-2018T01:24:24,Dadrobit,"Didn't want the kids to panic at school I guess with a ""We're under attack"" announcement."
12-08-2018T01:24:29,Bgrmystr2,it's not like you're wasting time watching something when you should be doin homework or whatever
12-08-2018T01:24:49,Bgrmystr2,I was talkin more about the tv at home thing
12-08-2018T01:24:53,Bgrmystr2,not the school thing
12-08-2018T01:25:24,Dadrobit,"Eh, pops wasn't home. He was helping evacuate the high school."
12-08-2018T01:25:59,Dadrobit,"And crazy bitch was too hysterical to get anything across to me other than, ""You can't understand!"""
12-08-2018T01:26:01,unsteddyphoenix,"We were told, we just didnt really understand. Only got that it was serious"
12-08-2018T01:26:46,Bgrmystr2,loootta ppl died that day
12-08-2018T01:26:48,Bgrmystr2,wasn't a good day
12-08-2018T01:27:02,Dadrobit,Around 3000 iirc.
12-08-2018T01:27:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I was in kindergarten I think
12-08-2018T01:28:06,Dadrobit,Mrs. Blaylock's 5th grade class.
12-08-2018T01:29:34,SpazztasticKiwi,We all sat in the hall (almost tornado drill style) till teacher comes to collect us one by one after they verify each parent-to-child relationship claimed is accurate
12-08-2018T01:30:25,TorqueEmUp,6th grade class here
12-08-2018T01:31:08,TorqueEmUp,I remember it was a day we were allowed to chew gum as a class reward for something.
12-08-2018T01:31:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Teachers whispering to each other
12-08-2018T01:32:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"What I remember is that my dad showed up with my mom. Despite my mom always being the one to pick us up from school every day, he decided to come with that day"
12-08-2018T01:32:23,Dadrobit,Mrs. Blaylock had us all play Heads Up 7 Up and Silent Ball until the busses arrived.
12-08-2018T01:32:33,SpazztasticKiwi,If I remember right
12-08-2018T01:32:40,TorqueEmUp,"Things were a little crazy here, because this is a military base town."
12-08-2018T01:33:03,unsteddyphoenix,Wow I never knew there were such big reactions in schools
12-08-2018T01:33:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"All the teachers were whispering to each other, everything was quiet and the school basically went into lockdown"
12-08-2018T01:34:09,TorqueEmUp,"I just remember the teach from across the hall come over and say turn on the TV, ""A plane struck a tower in new york."""
12-08-2018T01:34:24,TorqueEmUp,"I saw the second plane hit the tower, live on TV."
12-08-2018T01:34:42,SpazztasticKiwi,They evacuated for great of another attack. On a school or something similar so evacuations were put out
12-08-2018T01:34:49,SpazztasticKiwi,*fear
12-08-2018T01:35:19,TorqueEmUp,"We were on lockdown for a bit, before they called the busses, and let parents start picking their kids up."
12-08-2018T01:35:36,Dadrobit,"Well, I mean, when the Pentagon, literally one of the biggest icons of the military and Department of Defense is blown the fuck up, people get really upset about the possibility of it being more than a single attack."
12-08-2018T01:35:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt even remember them allowing busses to run
12-08-2018T01:36:24,SpazztasticKiwi,All parents were called for an emergency pick up. And you had to be on the approved to pick up child list
12-08-2018T01:36:28,TorqueEmUp,I didn't know about the Pentagon until after I got home and basically sitting in front of the TV watching the news all day.
12-08-2018T01:37:32,TorqueEmUp,"I remember before I got off the bus that morning. Two really big military choppers flew right over the school very very low. ""Probably less than 100 feet."""
12-08-2018T01:38:05,TorqueEmUp,"We never see military choppers around here, even being an Air Force Base."
12-08-2018T01:38:43,TorqueEmUp,We only really see the big C-130s and the like.
12-08-2018T01:39:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm surprised there wasn‚Äôt a panic when all the cryptic quiet stuff started with the adults. They weren‚Äôt answering questions other than ‚Äúmommy and daddy are coming to get you‚Äù stuff
12-08-2018T01:39:43,unsteddyphoenix,oof weird
12-08-2018T01:40:21,TorqueEmUp,"They didn't tell us much. Being 6th grade, we knew shit was going wrong."
12-08-2018T01:40:23,SpazztasticKiwi,My dad was paying attention to the military part of it
12-08-2018T01:41:01,TorqueEmUp,"Like, we are on lockdown, once we get the go ahead you can be picked up by you parents or ride the bus home."
12-08-2018T01:41:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Pretty sure there was a wonder if they‚Äôd try contacting him even after his retirement
12-08-2018T01:41:50,TorqueEmUp,"Then later that evening, after the eerie silence that haunted that day."
12-08-2018T01:42:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"My mom had some semblance of normality. I told her how the day had gone for me, and she acted like this was just an odd random thing"
12-08-2018T01:42:05,TorqueEmUp,That whole day was very silent.
12-08-2018T01:43:03,TorqueEmUp,"Then about early evening there was a loud BANG that rattled people's windows, and knocked stuff off shelves."
12-08-2018T01:43:23,TorqueEmUp,a plane broke the sound barrier over our area.
12-08-2018T01:43:48,TorqueEmUp,Scared the ever loving shit out of people.
12-08-2018T01:45:11,TorqueEmUp,I remember just about every little thing that happened that day.
12-08-2018T01:45:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember little
12-08-2018T01:45:58,TorqueEmUp,Even what episode of Hey Arnold was on Nickelodeon.
12-08-2018T01:46:03,TorqueEmUp,That morning
12-08-2018T01:46:37,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, not surprising seeing you were only like 5."
12-08-2018T01:46:49,SpazztasticKiwi,That day was a special type of insanity
12-08-2018T01:47:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd like to see the Teardrop Memorial statue one day
12-08-2018T01:47:52,TorqueEmUp,My folks went to see all that recently.
12-08-2018T01:48:24,TorqueEmUp,"We actually have a local memorial too, a piece of the mangled beams from the tower."
12-08-2018T01:48:37,TorqueEmUp,one of the towers*
12-08-2018T01:51:15,SpazztasticKiwi,We have some war memorials but one‚Äôs WW2 and the other‚Äôs is either the Korean War or some other
12-08-2018T01:52:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Grandpa was an Air Force pilot but I don‚Äôt remember what war
12-08-2018T01:53:05,TorqueEmUp,My father was a medic in the airforce during vietnam.
12-08-2018T01:53:15,SpazztasticKiwi,That was it
12-08-2018T01:53:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Vietnam
12-08-2018T01:53:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Couldn‚Äôt think of the country for the life of me
12-08-2018T01:53:54,TorqueEmUp,"my grandfather on my mother's side drove tanks during WW2, but I don't think ever saw combat."
12-08-2018T01:55:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Other grandpa was in the Navy I believe and my dad was in the Guard
12-08-2018T01:55:15,TorqueEmUp,"My dad's brother though did see combat during Vietnam, and still has PTSD from that."
12-08-2018T01:55:21,Dadrobit,Great Grandfather was a Merchant Marine in WW2. Uncle was a marksman in Vietnam. Brother is currently serving as a Sgt overseeing a Stryker crew.
12-08-2018T01:55:53,Dadrobit,"I wanted to go USAF, but my accident killed that dream."
12-08-2018T01:56:02,TorqueEmUp,God what a worthless war Vienam was. =/
12-08-2018T01:56:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I think we‚Äôve had every branch of military except marines
12-08-2018T01:56:51,TorqueEmUp,My aunt was briefly in the Marines. Like very briefly.
12-08-2018T01:57:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember seeing my first Marine on duty. I was at a hospital with my mom. Her mom was getting a surgery done
12-08-2018T01:57:33,TorqueEmUp,No other real family military history.
12-08-2018T01:57:49,TorqueEmUp,"Well, another uncle of mine was in the Navy."
12-08-2018T01:57:59,SpazztasticKiwi,And this huge man in uniform marches in with buttons and a pressed suit
12-08-2018T01:58:15,TorqueEmUp,heh
12-08-2018T01:58:17,Dadrobit,"Wanted to be one of two things. An A-10 pilot, or if I couldn't do that, be a JTAC so I could be the one calling them in."
12-08-2018T01:58:18,SpazztasticKiwi,He was walking with this older lady
12-08-2018T01:58:54,TorqueEmUp,"I was in Airforce Junior ROTC in highschool. Basically most of that class was just maintaining uniforms, and practicing marching. lol"
12-08-2018T01:58:57,SpazztasticKiwi,On her right. Perfect steps. Stopped only to offer her a chair. And get her some of the coffee on the table
12-08-2018T01:59:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Then stood against the wall at attention for what I believe was a little over an hour
12-08-2018T01:59:54,SpazztasticKiwi,My dumbass gawking like he‚Äôd grown another head
12-08-2018T02:00:22,TorqueEmUp,I actually enjoyed practicing marching.
12-08-2018T02:00:27,TorqueEmUp,granted we sucked at it.
12-08-2018T02:00:51,TorqueEmUp,"couldn't stay lined up, and people marching out of sync."
12-08-2018T02:01:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"The white shirt guys are Marines, right?"
12-08-2018T02:01:29,TorqueEmUp,"I dunno, sounds like Navy to me."
12-08-2018T02:01:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Oops
12-08-2018T02:01:43,SpazztasticKiwi,He was Navy then
12-08-2018T02:02:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Marine is blue shirt...?
12-08-2018T02:02:02,Dadrobit,"Yeah, Navy is White lol. USMC is black"
12-08-2018T02:02:25,Dadrobit,Or very very dark blue
12-08-2018T02:02:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"The point is, I knew he was military but I was mainly staring trying to figure out what branch"
12-08-2018T02:03:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I finally did ask my mom. Bad at remembering what she said
12-08-2018T02:03:49,TorqueEmUp,":musical_note:""In the Navy!:musical_note:"
12-08-2018T02:04:03,TorqueEmUp,:P
12-08-2018T02:04:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Because i seriously didn‚Äôt want to walk up to this guy who‚Äôd I‚Äôd been watching for a solid 30 minutes or so and ask him what branch he was
12-08-2018T02:04:29,Dadrobit,"I mean, to throw you a bone, the USMC is a breakaway branch that originated in the Navy."
12-08-2018T02:05:16,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah for some reason I do remember hearing ""Naval Marines"""
12-08-2018T02:05:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"Embarrassingly enough, thought that ran through my head was ‚ÄúI want me one of those‚Äù"
12-08-2018T02:06:39,TorqueEmUp,"I couldn't get into any branch of the military. Maybe Army, but any other brand I'd have to lose quite a bit of weight."""
12-08-2018T02:07:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Dude was cool
12-08-2018T02:08:08,TorqueEmUp,"Just had a high school friend join the Air Force, currently stationed out in the boonies while he goes to school, then after he finished that him and his family are going to be moved to Japan."
12-08-2018T02:08:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Didn‚Äôt know if he was doing something important helping that lady either so I didn‚Äôt go up to him. Could‚Äôve been just her son or something
12-08-2018T02:08:21,TorqueEmUp,finishes*
12-08-2018T02:09:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I know a kid that I‚Äôd honestly qualify as racist who just got sworn into the Marines
12-08-2018T02:09:32,TorqueEmUp,"Only thing that kills me about joining any branch of the military, is Basic."
12-08-2018T02:09:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm curious as to how that‚Äôs gonna develop
12-08-2018T02:15:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I‚Äôm not sure if what he says is for making people mad or if he‚Äôs grown up or not so
12-08-2018T02:16:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm gonna go on for bedtime üõå
12-08-2018T02:17:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"Laters, chat. Hope you do better Tom"
12-08-2018T02:18:28,Dadrobit,o/

12-08-2018T02:20:10,FennexTheFox,"i finished my pc build today. 4k is sweet, but im still stuck on my 970 until i can afford a new gpu ;-;"
12-08-2018T02:35:27,Bgrmystr2,I'm using a 760 and it's totally fine. what do you need higher than a 970 for?
12-08-2018T02:35:50,Bgrmystr2,you mining bitcoin or something? lol

12-08-2018T21:44:50,NeonMitsumi,I have not. Would you be kind enough to tell me some?
12-08-2018T21:46:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Less jitters
12-08-2018T21:47:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"Which can help lower stress, blood pressure, anxiety"
12-08-2018T21:48:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Help you sleep and reset your internal clock
12-08-2018T21:48:15,NeonMitsumi,I see.
12-08-2018T21:48:24,unsteddyphoenix,Couldnt you just achieve all that by not drinking coffee altogether
12-08-2018T21:48:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Leading to better more restful sleep
12-08-2018T21:48:28,NeonMitsumi,"Soooo, you mean... :cneonmitsumi-theresnomorecoff: More coffee?"
12-08-2018T21:48:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Some people are addicted to coffee taste and/or can‚Äôt have caffeine
12-08-2018T21:49:19,Dadrobit,"Mmmm, let me just pour a cup of double esspresso into my can of Monster."
12-08-2018T21:49:21,SpazztasticKiwi,So decaf is their only option

12-08-2018T21:50:18,Dadrobit,Happened to a buddy of mine in High School.
12-08-2018T21:50:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Only time I tried that monster junk was when my ex offered a taste
12-08-2018T21:50:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Nasty

12-08-2018T21:54:13,unsteddyphoenix,I'll deal with calories

12-08-2018T22:39:20,Bgrmystr2,I'm under the opinion that you did that just so ppl see it and WAT at your folders.
12-08-2018T22:39:33,Bgrmystr2,but I'm also under the opinion that they are probably not fake.
12-08-2018T22:47:25,Dadrobit,"I mean, the folders are real, but they're not the most explanatory. That one is where I keep all of my student records and study material related links."
