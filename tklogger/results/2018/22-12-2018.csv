22-12-2018T00:00:02,Bgrmystr2,no wait it's 9 lives isn't it..
22-12-2018T00:00:12,Bgrmystr2,so 18 to 27.
22-12-2018T00:00:27,Bgrmystr2,I messed up. Tehe :ptv-SteelwormHades:
22-12-2018T00:01:07,Bgrmystr2,"In other news, I legit have no idea."
22-12-2018T00:01:29,TheBeckoner,no idea as to what?
22-12-2018T00:01:39,Bgrmystr2,cat years
22-12-2018T00:01:45,TheBeckoner,I see
22-12-2018T00:01:57,TheBeckoner,you must be a catist
22-12-2018T00:04:45,Bgrmystr2,uh.
22-12-2018T00:05:06,Bgrmystr2,Yes.... because.. that's totally not a leap in logic and coming out of left field. xD
22-12-2018T00:06:52,SpazztasticKiwi,The one to every seven thing is supposed to be for dogs
22-12-2018T00:07:07,Bgrmystr2,yeah.. hence the tehe
22-12-2018T00:07:12,Bgrmystr2,but Beck got to it first
22-12-2018T00:07:13,SpazztasticKiwi,But it’s not entirely accurate. Dogs actually age at a scaling rate
22-12-2018T00:07:20,Bgrmystr2,you've failed me kiwi :(
22-12-2018T00:07:29,Bgrmystr2,I had it all set up and you just missed your chance
22-12-2018T00:07:37,Bgrmystr2,and yeah that I know
22-12-2018T00:08:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Rapidly - perhaps starting at a 7 to 1 ratio then slowing. Doggos age until they are the goodest they can be
22-12-2018T00:08:29,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s why their lives are shorter
22-12-2018T00:09:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Think Tom knows how old Lucy is?
22-12-2018T00:11:17,Bgrmystr2,dunno
22-12-2018T00:12:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I still can’t get over Mark calling the little dogs “yippy bastards”
22-12-2018T00:13:17,TheBeckoner,lol that was a cute video
22-12-2018T00:13:37,TheBeckoner,I should watch mark more
22-12-2018T00:13:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Apparently Lucy is a fluffy white tank
22-12-2018T00:13:43,TheBeckoner,on youtube that is
22-12-2018T00:14:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah that’s a great opener when meeting Tom
22-12-2018T00:14:12,SpazztasticKiwi,“I watch your brother”
22-12-2018T00:14:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Totally not restraining order worthy
22-12-2018T00:17:31,Bgrmystr2,haha
22-12-2018T00:22:24,TheBeckoner,lol
22-12-2018T00:22:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d try something like that but he’s never seen my face and might actually call security
22-12-2018T00:31:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’m going out on a limb here but based on Bagheera just now crawling under my arm, right on top of my chest in front of my phone complete with a paw on my face"
22-12-2018T00:31:23,SpazztasticKiwi,...he wants attention
22-12-2018T01:26:28,PotatoRights,Likely conclusion
22-12-2018T01:28:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Just watched a guy share the aftermath of a homemade glitter and stink bomb fake package for delivery thieves
22-12-2018T01:29:08,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s the little things that lift your spirits
22-12-2018T02:33:45,TheBeckoner,Those videos are always suspicious to me...
22-12-2018T02:34:00,TheBeckoner,"if youre talking about the one im thinking about, they seem fake."
22-12-2018T02:59:35,Bgrmystr2,"I believe I saw the one Kiwi was talking about, and I'm fairly doubtful it's a fake"
22-12-2018T02:59:40,Bgrmystr2,people steal packages all the time
22-12-2018T03:00:15,Bgrmystr2,"it's a very common thing, just not very well covered because, you know, noone's actually watching the package most of the time"
22-12-2018T03:00:26,Bgrmystr2,because most people don't expect their package to just.. disappear.
22-12-2018T03:49:53,SpazztasticKiwi,He planted a glitter bomb camera package and waited
22-12-2018T03:50:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"After being sprayed with glitter and stink spray, thieves abandoned the box"
22-12-2018T03:51:18,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s on yt
22-12-2018T05:12:47,Bgrmystr2,"it was the one with four phone cameras and the spinning glitter thing w/ the can of fart spray, yes? lol"
22-12-2018T05:12:53,Bgrmystr2,cuz it sounds like the same one
22-12-2018T05:12:57,Bgrmystr2,and it looked legit to me
22-12-2018T05:28:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Yea

22-12-2018T10:25:20,TheBeckoner,ugghhhh I have a terrible headache...
22-12-2018T10:25:36,TheBeckoner,head feels like its full of bubble gum
22-12-2018T10:26:01,CrimsonQuill,Tea...I need tea again
22-12-2018T10:36:14,Azumachan,How's everyone going ?
22-12-2018T10:44:52,CrimsonQuill,Groggily...
22-12-2018T10:44:57,CrimsonQuill,My mind's mushy.
22-12-2018T10:45:10,CrimsonQuill,I don't know what I'm doing really.
22-12-2018T10:52:34,Dadrobit,Suggestion submitted. Will likely moss most all of the stream though. Having a pre-Christmas party Christmas party at grandma's later today.
22-12-2018T10:52:40,Dadrobit,miss*
22-12-2018T10:52:56,CrimsonQuill,I'm going to try press through the entire stream.

22-12-2018T12:05:11,CrimsonQuill,"Nice suggestion, Azumachan!"
22-12-2018T12:06:41,Azumachan,You should thanks Tom !
22-12-2018T12:07:36,CrimsonQuill,And thanks Tom!
22-12-2018T12:07:58,CrimsonQuill,I'm going with a Modified Subnautica request tonight.
22-12-2018T12:08:04,CrimsonQuill,Only one character.
22-12-2018T12:08:22,RimaDraws,hi
22-12-2018T12:08:27,CrimsonQuill,Hello
22-12-2018T12:08:33,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-victory:
22-12-2018T12:10:15,RimaDraws,hi quill
22-12-2018T12:10:34,CrimsonQuill,What's your suggestion this week?
22-12-2018T12:11:08,RimaDraws,"still the same as always"" euchre mary raine and rose enjoying the christmas holiday together"""
22-12-2018T12:11:18,RimaDraws,but i dont know if it will get voted again because i may not be here
22-12-2018T12:11:41,CrimsonQuill,I'll vote for it if it comes up.
22-12-2018T12:11:54,CrimsonQuill,Is Raine going to be human or Keidran?
22-12-2018T12:12:05,CrimsonQuill,Or Half and half?
22-12-2018T12:12:07,RimaDraws,i really had no thought on that..
22-12-2018T12:12:14,RimaDraws,now that you mentioned it.
22-12-2018T12:12:24,RimaDraws,i dont care as long as tom wants to draw her how he sees fit
22-12-2018T12:12:27,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, well, I'm sure Tom will fill in the gaps."
22-12-2018T12:12:46,CrimsonQuill,Remember what happened when I forgot to say which gender Halo Raine's AI would be?
22-12-2018T12:13:02,RimaDraws,well yea i do
22-12-2018T12:13:26,RimaDraws,i mean it doesnt matter to me what race raine is. i like her wolf form honestly more
22-12-2018T12:14:07,CrimsonQuill,"I like her in all three, though I think my favourite picture of her will always be her halfkind form in the strip, 'First Watch', in the second panel."
22-12-2018T12:14:45,CrimsonQuill,"I'm almost certain that she'll go all fluffy again in the manor this chapter, if the cover's anything to go by."
22-12-2018T12:14:59,RimaDraws,she's been fluffy
22-12-2018T12:15:20,RimaDraws,if you read the past chapters shouldn't she be fluffy?
22-12-2018T12:15:36,CrimsonQuill,I think she should be whom she chooses.
22-12-2018T12:15:45,RimaDraws,i agree
22-12-2018T12:15:51,RimaDraws,keidran or not she is still raine.
22-12-2018T12:16:00,CrimsonQuill,"She's my personal favourite character, besides Kieth, Trace and Flora."
22-12-2018T12:16:06,RimaDraws,the only problem with her situation she cant control when she transforms
22-12-2018T12:16:35,CrimsonQuill,"If only she'd been taught...looking at NO ONE in Particular, MARY SILVERLOCK"
22-12-2018T12:16:49,CrimsonQuill,Perhaps Rose'll teach her a thing or two.
22-12-2018T12:17:14,RimaDraws,rose can't teach her
22-12-2018T12:17:19,RimaDraws,rose doesn't use a lot of magic
22-12-2018T12:17:26,RimaDraws,only her father euchre does.
22-12-2018T12:17:45,CrimsonQuill,"It's funny, I imagine Rose and Euchre as having British accents, but Raine has an American one."
22-12-2018T12:17:55,RimaDraws,no rose has a southern drawl
22-12-2018T12:17:57,CrimsonQuill,And Rose can use some magic to move round th house.
22-12-2018T12:18:13,CrimsonQuill,"My idea of Southern Drawl is Sussex area, where my Grandparents live."
22-12-2018T12:19:01,RimaDraws,no no no
22-12-2018T12:19:05,CrimsonQuill,"Raine's accent is a combination of Cortana's from Halo, Kara's from Detroit Become Human, and various minor characters from other franchises."
22-12-2018T12:19:13,RimaDraws,southern drawl is how people in the south of north america speak
22-12-2018T12:19:18,CrimsonQuill,Hers is the hardest to pin down.
22-12-2018T12:19:25,CrimsonQuill,I don't live in America though
22-12-2018T12:19:36,RimaDraws,well if you heard any of us from the south like me
22-12-2018T12:19:42,RimaDraws,you would know what a southern drawl is
22-12-2018T12:19:47,CrimsonQuill,"And personally, some characters don't seem...right without British accents."
22-12-2018T12:19:56,RimaDraws,well not everyone would have one
22-12-2018T12:20:05,CrimsonQuill,"I gave Keith one right off the bat, just to see...and it works so well with me."
22-12-2018T12:20:18,RimaDraws,i could imagine a few of the characters maybe clovis but i digress
22-12-2018T12:20:28,CrimsonQuill,Clovis for me has an American one.
22-12-2018T12:20:56,CrimsonQuill,Many of the characters have American accents.
22-12-2018T12:21:23,CrimsonQuill,But I gave the Basitins various British Dialects.
22-12-2018T12:21:53,CrimsonQuill,"One of the guards, for example, sounds like Call of Duty's Captain Price."
22-12-2018T12:22:11,RimaDraws,well i could actually help with how a southern drawl sounds.
22-12-2018T12:22:14,CrimsonQuill,I try to find an accent that I believe best fits the character.
22-12-2018T12:22:24,RimaDraws,its very complicated for people who aren't southern american
22-12-2018T12:22:42,CrimsonQuill,Is it like the Texas accent Joel has in the Last of Us?
22-12-2018T12:24:26,RimaDraws,well...
22-12-2018T12:24:38,RimaDraws,texas or tennessean (like me) or other southern states
22-12-2018T12:25:22,CrimsonQuill,"Naaaahhh...Rose just sounds better with a Queen's English accent as a seneschal, and a bit of normal Sussex dialect when the Facade drops."
22-12-2018T12:27:07,RimaDraws,its not barbaric if thats what you think...
22-12-2018T12:27:23,CrimsonQuill,I don't see it as Barbaric at all...
22-12-2018T12:27:32,RimaDraws,then what are you implying...
22-12-2018T12:27:35,CrimsonQuill,I just think it clicks better with Rose's character.
22-12-2018T12:27:46,CrimsonQuill,I can't see her with an American accent.
22-12-2018T12:27:52,CrimsonQuill,I really can't.
22-12-2018T12:28:11,RimaDraws,its not really american
22-12-2018T12:28:17,RimaDraws,im just saying thats what a southern drawl is
22-12-2018T12:28:27,CrimsonQuill,"I'd started by giving Euchre a British accent, and since Rose is his cousin, it just seemed correct to give her one."
22-12-2018T12:28:56,RimaDraws,if you say so...i give up
22-12-2018T12:29:07,CrimsonQuill,"I can give a list of all non-Basitins with British Accents in my head (because, as aforementioned, I gave every Basitin a British Accent)."
22-12-2018T12:29:12,CrimsonQuill,Euchre
22-12-2018T12:29:16,CrimsonQuill,Roselyn
22-12-2018T12:29:18,CrimsonQuill,Saria
22-12-2018T12:29:21,CrimsonQuill,Sirius
22-12-2018T12:29:32,CrimsonQuill,Alice Reed
22-12-2018T12:30:31,CrimsonQuill,It's just the way these characters click...
22-12-2018T12:30:38,RimaDraws,to you it may seem
22-12-2018T12:30:53,RimaDraws,i won't argue with this anymore. i got things to do
22-12-2018T12:30:54,CrimsonQuill,"Well, everyone has their own idea of a character's voice."
22-12-2018T12:31:02,CrimsonQuill,I respect yours though.

22-12-2018T12:32:37,CrimsonQuill,o/ Terra
22-12-2018T12:32:58,RimaDraws,i just dont think she has a british sussex accent
22-12-2018T12:33:07,RimaDraws,i think thats just because you come from england
22-12-2018T12:33:46,CrimsonQuill,Probably
22-12-2018T12:36:29,RimaDraws,point being there hasn't been a confirmation where the characters accents come from. we can only guess. and i won't argue over it.
22-12-2018T12:36:37,RimaDraws,why did that send twice..
22-12-2018T12:36:56,CrimsonQuill,I only see one...
22-12-2018T12:37:00,CrimsonQuill,hmm....
22-12-2018T12:37:20,CrimsonQuill,I think I'll spend the time between now and the stream reading Calvin and Hobbes.
22-12-2018T12:37:45,RimaDraws,on my end i see two because my internet went to shit
22-12-2018T12:37:56,CrimsonQuill,Oh crumbs

22-12-2018T15:26:13,iliar,I think the reason for the mistake may be the translation. Translated names are often distorted. And the man used the name that he used to see in the translation.

22-12-2018T17:07:57,Bgrmystr2,I'll never understand how you can get an infection somewhere like your inner ear without people actually poking around in there to infect it to begin with..
22-12-2018T17:07:59,FenceEqualizer,Hope you get a speedy recovery also medication
22-12-2018T17:08:27,CrimsonQuill,"@Bgrmystr2 there are certain things that get in, no matter how careful you are."
22-12-2018T17:08:30,Kynum,"Maybe they do, but they're just ninja's and you never notice."
22-12-2018T17:08:36,CrimsonQuill,Build up of wax can also pose problems.
22-12-2018T17:08:37,FenceEqualizer,Little kids can get everywhere
22-12-2018T17:09:00,CatzArt,I got an ear infection from a public pool.
22-12-2018T17:09:07,Bgrmystr2,"if lil kids get inside your ear, Fence, you may have some bigger issues"

22-12-2018T17:09:51,Dadrobit,Had tinnitus in that ear for a month following
22-12-2018T17:09:55,CrimsonQuill,"An ear infection can affect your sense of balance...that's where the balance centres are located, after all."

22-12-2018T17:10:22,Bgrmystr2,"but they never get INSIDE your ear, do they?"

22-12-2018T17:13:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Dunno how fast an ear infection takes to set in but at least it’s nothing more
22-12-2018T17:13:51,Bgrmystr2,it's not the only place it's used.

22-12-2018T18:21:20,Bgrmystr2,yeah
22-12-2018T18:21:21,MviluUatusun,After she's had too much eggnog?
22-12-2018T18:21:24,CrimsonQuill,I wish I could stargaze more.
22-12-2018T18:21:26,Bgrmystr2,Keith carrying drunk natani
22-12-2018T18:21:33,CrimsonQuill,But the skies are not clear enough.
22-12-2018T18:21:52,CrimsonQuill,And the lights unleash the merciles orange glare into the sky.
22-12-2018T18:21:53,Ordithus,Little does Nat know this is the non-alcoholic variety
22-12-2018T18:21:54,MrMongMong,Maybe Natani mixed in some Basitin ale?
22-12-2018T18:21:59,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
22-12-2018T18:22:08,MrMongMong,#PlaceboEffect
22-12-2018T18:22:10,Bgrmystr2,or maybe basitins get drunk SUPER easily
22-12-2018T18:22:12,Bgrmystr2,..
22-12-2018T18:22:14,Bgrmystr2,Keidran*
22-12-2018T18:22:17,MviluUatusun,"Is that anything like Romulan Ale, Mong?"
22-12-2018T18:22:18,CrimsonQuill,"No, Nat's tried some Pusser's Rum smuggled from HMS Victory."
22-12-2018T18:22:22,CrimsonQuill,UNDILUTED
22-12-2018T18:22:27,Bgrmystr2,my brain looked at keith when typing >.>
22-12-2018T18:22:30,unsteddyphoenix,"""Drunk off milk"" is less of a joke when it comes to keidran"
22-12-2018T18:22:38,MrMongMong,"Apparently Basitan ale is particularly strong, and flammable."
22-12-2018T18:22:52,CrimsonQuill,It has nuclear energy when mixed with magical artifacts.
22-12-2018T18:22:57,Bgrmystr2,I recall keidran being very easily drunk
22-12-2018T18:22:59,ProsePro7,Basitian rum is practically gasoline so I dont think they get drunk easy
22-12-2018T18:23:02,MisterWho,Dwarfs aproof ! XD
22-12-2018T18:23:04,Ordithus,Basitin ale is at least 100 proof to blow up like it do
22-12-2018T18:23:08,Zakuru,METRIIOOODDD
22-12-2018T18:23:18,Zakuru,gyrates
22-12-2018T18:23:18,MrMongMong,"@Bgrmystr2 don't worry, it's hard NOT to look at Keith."
22-12-2018T18:23:20,CrimsonQuill,Never played or seen Metroid.
22-12-2018T18:23:23,MviluUatusun,"I understand there's some alcoholic drink made from milk, phoenix."
22-12-2018T18:23:27,CrimsonQuill,Sorry Zakuru
22-12-2018T18:23:33,Bgrmystr2,"no it isn't Mong, my brain just derped"
22-12-2018T18:23:35,MrMongMong,Forrest Keith.
22-12-2018T18:23:37,Zakuru,its the only game my dad could sucessfully play
22-12-2018T18:23:41,ProsePro7,Metroid fun but not that fun
22-12-2018T18:23:47,CrimsonQuill,Maybe I should give it a go.
22-12-2018T18:23:52,MisterWho,Best Dwarfs beer - with 101% Alcohol!
22-12-2018T18:23:58,Zakuru,this song is just a nostalgia blast
22-12-2018T18:24:01,CrimsonQuill,Got to finish Mass Effect 2 and Halo 3 ODST first
22-12-2018T18:24:07,CrimsonQuill,And Skyrim
22-12-2018T18:24:09,CrimsonQuill,And Subnautica
22-12-2018T18:24:13,CrimsonQuill,And Dark Souls 3
22-12-2018T18:24:21,MisterWho,Subnautica - isn't that freeware now?
22-12-2018T18:24:23,ProsePro7,Im on Assassins Creed Origins myself
22-12-2018T18:24:24,CrimsonQuill,No
22-12-2018T18:24:34,MrMongMong,"When you are pseudo-dating a person that cannot drink, and you come from a species that can basically drink medical alcohol without ill effect."
22-12-2018T18:24:36,CrimsonQuill,Subnauseous is still something to buy
22-12-2018T18:24:42,Bgrmystr2,"it's not freeware, but it is free for a short time"
22-12-2018T18:24:55,CrimsonQuill,Let me check that...
22-12-2018T18:24:57,Infinitedge,:wave::eyes:
22-12-2018T18:25:01,Xexanoth,subnautica is way to annoying
22-12-2018T18:25:05,Bgrmystr2,"I can confirm it, Cuz I've gotten advertisements for it"
22-12-2018T18:25:08,Bgrmystr2,plenty of time
22-12-2018T18:25:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,INFINITE!!!!:ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:

22-12-2018T18:25:52,Ordithus,Lost them in the war
22-12-2018T18:25:53,Bgrmystr2,"she drunk, bro"
22-12-2018T18:26:00,MrMongMong,He took them when he was drunk.
22-12-2018T18:26:01,CrimsonQuill,The music and atmosphere of Subnautica and the sense of fear and paranoia givse the game it's charm.
22-12-2018T18:26:11,unsteddyphoenix,If you still have pants you havent drunk enough :upside_down:
22-12-2018T18:26:25,Bgrmystr2,agree w/ the upsidedown guy ^
22-12-2018T18:26:28,MisterWho,epicgames - it's freeware - for now.
22-12-2018T18:26:31,CrimsonQuill,Never drink more than two glasses in one night.
22-12-2018T18:26:33,CatzArt,indeed crimson that game has a good atmosphere
22-12-2018T18:26:34,Dimensional,"If Nat saw what the request was, she'd probably threaten the person for calling her fat. XP"
22-12-2018T18:26:35,FenceEqualizer,Means you had too much :ptv-shock:
22-12-2018T18:26:36,MrMongMong,He probably took them off.
22-12-2018T18:26:37,Bgrmystr2,"that's not what freeware means, Who"
22-12-2018T18:26:37,CrimsonQuill,And drink water in between
22-12-2018T18:26:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'll be the designated pants holder I guess
22-12-2018T18:26:48,CrimsonQuill,That's what my Mum says
22-12-2018T18:26:49,Bgrmystr2,Freeware means it's ALWAYS been free
22-12-2018T18:26:49,Ordithus,Natani is a cute derp assassin <3 :ctwokinds-awoo:
22-12-2018T18:26:51,MrMongMong,"Natani: Keith, is waarrrmmmmm~"
22-12-2018T18:26:57,MrMongMong,"Keith: NATANI, NO!!!"
22-12-2018T18:27:05,Bgrmystr2,"or sometimes, will become free"
22-12-2018T18:27:10,MisterWho,"Okay, it's temporary free - mea culpa."
22-12-2018T18:27:13,CrimsonQuill,Natani needs to visit the Anhk Morpork Assassin's Guild...
22-12-2018T18:27:20,MisterWho,nooo

22-12-2018T18:27:41,MisterWho,"Young Vimes, the King killer?"
22-12-2018T18:27:50,CrimsonQuill,"No, not Stoneface."
22-12-2018T18:27:59,CrimsonQuill,"Nice to see another Discworld fan, mate!"
22-12-2018T18:28:04,MrMongMong,"At the moment, without colors, Natani looks a bit like Raine."
22-12-2018T18:28:14,CrimsonQuill,No she doesn't
22-12-2018T18:28:15,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RaineEep:
22-12-2018T18:28:15,MisterWho,First rule in Street Fight - no rules.
22-12-2018T18:28:18,Xexanoth,not really
22-12-2018T18:28:19,CrimsonQuill,Raine's hair is nicer
22-12-2018T18:28:22,Xexanoth,^
22-12-2018T18:28:33,CrimsonQuill,and Her cheeks are more pointed as a keidran than Nat
22-12-2018T18:28:43,MrMongMong,"Well, now he looks like natani again."
22-12-2018T18:29:16,MrMongMong,Oh. It really was nonalcoholic.
22-12-2018T18:29:17,HeresyArtStream,Natani better watch it. Keith's instinct to wolftoss is increasing. :V

22-12-2018T18:29:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Keith gonna pull something
22-12-2018T18:29:55,CrimsonQuill,"@MisterWho Vimes:And for close-up fighting, as your senior sergeant I explicitly forbid you to investigate the range of coshes, blackjacks, and brass knuckles sold by Mrs. Goodbody at No. 8 Easy Street at a range of prices to suit all pockets."
22-12-2018T18:30:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Also I’ve been here the entire time
22-12-2018T18:30:04,MrMongMong,"He's probably pretending to be drunk, just to mess with KEith."
22-12-2018T18:30:09,CrimsonQuill,"God, that took a bit to type"
22-12-2018T18:30:10,Bgrmystr2,doubt it
22-12-2018T18:30:23,PalmettoPathfinder1,Wow.  Nat is drunk.  Poor Keith.
22-12-2018T18:30:36,CrimsonQuill,I always think of Nat as she...but still a cool character.
22-12-2018T18:30:41,unsteddyphoenix,"""Psh, this is still easy, do some squats now!"""
22-12-2018T18:30:45,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, if it was nat pretending to be drink, that's what the suggestion would have said"
22-12-2018T18:30:46,LittleNomster,"yes, obviously the egg nog lied"

22-12-2018T18:31:11,MviluUatusun,"All right, Natani.  Give Keith a break.  After all, you're at least 6"" taller than him."
22-12-2018T18:31:14,Alphawolf333,"""Eggnog"" where its only alcohol"
22-12-2018T18:31:24,CrimsonQuill,One drink tends to arrive in several glasses.

22-12-2018T18:31:38,KapitanGroszek,Tom! Will you be on comic con?
22-12-2018T18:31:41,CrimsonQuill,She needs a good cup of Klatchian Coffee-make her Knurd.
22-12-2018T18:31:44,Bgrmystr2,"100% alchohol, 10% eggnog flavoring"
22-12-2018T18:32:00,MrMongMong,"Eggnog, but all the ingredients have been replaced with alcohol."
22-12-2018T18:32:08,CrimsonQuill,"Knurd (Drunk backwards) is through sober, and out the other side."
22-12-2018T18:32:09,LittleNomster,hehehe
22-12-2018T18:32:13,NeonMitsumi,He'll probably be in Comic Con.

22-12-2018T18:32:31,KapitanGroszek,Thanx
22-12-2018T18:32:31,Ordithus,Tom goes to SDCC 90% of the time
22-12-2018T18:32:33,CrimsonQuill,"I cannot go to Comic Con this year,"
22-12-2018T18:32:48,MrMongMong,Natani is going to have one hecc of a hangover when he wakes up.
22-12-2018T18:32:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Even better: “I swear to dunk I’m not God Keith now put me up before I beat you down”
22-12-2018T18:32:51,CrimsonQuill,And probably not next either.
22-12-2018T18:32:57,MrMongMong,"In fact, he should be dead."
22-12-2018T18:32:58,MisterWho,"@CrimsonQuill: And for long range fighting don't try the exquisite bows from stroninthearm. Detritius, keep away from the peacemaker!"
22-12-2018T18:32:59,CrimsonQuill,Too expensive to get there
22-12-2018T18:33:04,FenceEqualizer,Comic Con was how I found out about Tom.
22-12-2018T18:33:24,CrimsonQuill,@MisterWho : My warrant is Mr Burleigh and Mr Stronginthearm!

22-12-2018T18:33:58,FenceEqualizer,Does she got Keith doing squats? Lol

22-12-2018T18:34:52,FenceEqualizer,"Hah, didn't even like Anthro stuff when I first found Tom, but as I was working at Comic Con I spotted Tom's booth and got curious."
22-12-2018T18:34:55,MrMongMong,I suppose a tall human+1 metric ton of floof?
22-12-2018T18:34:58,BadFoMo,@JDH A lot.
22-12-2018T18:35:00,MviluUatusun,I'd say about 2.5 Basitins JDH.

22-12-2018T18:35:24,FenceEqualizer,Of course I was working security so it meant only getting glances as I was doing rounds

22-12-2018T18:35:55,MisterWho,First time i saw anthro art was from Kacey - and my worst cedit card order+customs fee.
22-12-2018T18:36:01,MrMongMong,"I feel like the ""how much does a wolf keidrian weigh"" is nearly on par with the ""how many angels fit on a pin"" problem in terms of hand-wavy justification."

22-12-2018T18:36:34,ProsePro7,Anyone care so suggest some clean anthro artists I have a hard time finding them

22-12-2018T18:36:46,CrimsonQuill,"I learned about TK from my best friend in 2015-16, read it first December 2017."

22-12-2018T18:37:03,FenceEqualizer,"Wish I wasn't as embaressed as I was then to gain an interest in Anthro art work, would have at least said Hi to Tom"

22-12-2018T19:48:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Fatality
22-12-2018T19:48:07,CrimsonHelsing,some reason my mind pictured her holding onto that snowball like Robbie Rotten when he got launched by his own cannonball

22-12-2018T19:48:35,PalmettoPathfinder1,Although....Tom did remove the naked part probably to keep it fair I guess.
22-12-2018T19:48:44,JDH,"Palm, i voted for that one, would have been funny to see"
22-12-2018T19:48:45,PalmettoPathfinder1,Which is understandable and I agree.

22-12-2018T21:03:59,MviluUatusun,No.  I'm not afraid of heights.  I'm afraid of falling from even as little as 3 feet.

22-12-2018T21:08:03,unsteddyphoenix,"A rarity around here, I know~"
22-12-2018T21:08:05,MarshallMelon,Seems like we have a growing number of them. More so in the last few months than usual
22-12-2018T21:08:07,Xexanoth,oh right that guy
22-12-2018T21:08:21,Xexanoth,dude was weird...
22-12-2018T21:08:24,SpazztasticKiwi,He subbed and said he’d return but he appears to have decided not to
22-12-2018T21:08:51,MarshallMelon,I mean he could be a troll but I can never tell with this damn place anymore
22-12-2018T21:08:52,RimaDraws,Maybe he was scared off
22-12-2018T21:08:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I have better things to deal with. Car that was following me has reappeared
22-12-2018T21:09:09,CrRAR,:<
22-12-2018T21:09:16,RimaDraws,That’s not good
22-12-2018T21:09:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Crawled up behind me leaving for work and followed for a good mile flashing his lights
22-12-2018T21:09:51,MarshallMelon,Get a picture of his license plate
22-12-2018T21:09:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless I saw red and blue I wasn’t pulling over
22-12-2018T21:10:12,MarshallMelon,"Wait, you're texting while driving?"
22-12-2018T21:10:21,SpazztasticKiwi,This was two days ago
22-12-2018T21:10:25,RimaDraws,Yea probably the cops
22-12-2018T21:10:29,RimaDraws,Lol
22-12-2018T21:10:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn’t even have work today
22-12-2018T21:10:37,MarshallMelon,"Ah, welp. Big oof"
22-12-2018T21:10:40,MarshallMelon,Sorry
22-12-2018T21:10:51,FenceEqualizer,"Jeepers creepers batman, what the hell"
22-12-2018T21:10:59,MarshallMelon,I need to learn to stop jumping into these things
22-12-2018T21:11:17,SpazztasticKiwi,It had been about two months since he’d been spotted
22-12-2018T21:11:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Thing is i thought I’d scared him off
22-12-2018T21:11:44,Bgrmystr2,"Kiwi, if someone is following you for a long time and flashing their lights and you feel like they're a threat to you, you call the police, or go to your local police station"
22-12-2018T21:11:51,MarshallMelon,Any reason why they'd be stalking you?
22-12-2018T21:12:13,SpazztasticKiwi,My manager told me once earlier this year a man had been asking about me
22-12-2018T21:12:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Like a secret admirer
22-12-2018T21:12:24,MarshallMelon,"Oh, that's not good"
22-12-2018T21:12:29,FenceEqualizer,. . .
22-12-2018T21:12:53,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s mainly why I check in here at least once a day
22-12-2018T21:12:58,Ordithus,At least let the police know and give a description of the car. it's a start
22-12-2018T21:13:01,MarshallMelon,Next time it happens grab his plate and keep it on file. If it continues take it to the police
22-12-2018T21:13:15,Bgrmystr2,ain't the first time she's been followed though
22-12-2018T21:13:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I got pictures of who I think the truck is
22-12-2018T21:13:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Twice
22-12-2018T21:13:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d seen the same truck twice and photographed it twice at my job. Parked in the same row as me
22-12-2018T21:14:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"After the second time, it disappeared. And I hadn’t seen him since"
22-12-2018T21:14:23,MarshallMelon,Probably spooked him
22-12-2018T21:14:41,MarshallMelon,Which is either a good or bad thing depending on your interpretation
22-12-2018T21:14:45,FenceEqualizer,That's gawd damn creepy. Knows it's been repeated but hopefully you let the cops know
22-12-2018T21:14:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Till now and I never got to see who it was two days ago so it could be a rando or him
22-12-2018T21:15:05,Ordithus,Stay safe. seriously.
22-12-2018T21:15:24,SpazztasticKiwi,And another problem is the guy seemed to follow me to McDonald’s once
22-12-2018T21:15:27,SpazztasticKiwi,And just
22-12-2018T21:15:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Stared
22-12-2018T21:15:53,MarshallMelon,The entire time?
22-12-2018T21:16:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn’t give him my back and that’s the fastest I’ve poured my drink
22-12-2018T21:16:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Basically the entire time
22-12-2018T21:16:30,Bgrmystr2,"It's not.. ILLEGAL to stare at people in public, generally, But it is creepy, and people get weirded out, cuz noone really does that unless they're stalking you or someshit."
22-12-2018T21:16:30,SpazztasticKiwi,With his empty cup he bought and phone in hand
22-12-2018T21:16:41,MarshallMelon,"It could be argued as harassment, Bgr"
22-12-2018T21:17:14,MarshallMelon,"Hell, in UK law you've got the beginnings of an assault case here"
22-12-2018T21:17:23,SpazztasticKiwi,But this guy was maybe early 30s at the most. My manager said the guy asking for me was 40s
22-12-2018T21:17:52,SpazztasticKiwi,So I have no idea if this guy was just innocent and I’m paranoid or I got two stalkers
22-12-2018T21:18:20,MarshallMelon,"Best case scenario: Macca's guy had a crush. Worst case, you've got double-trouble"
22-12-2018T21:18:23,RimaDraws,Ye be careful please
22-12-2018T21:18:27,MarshallMelon,"Either way, not great"
22-12-2018T21:18:46,SpazztasticKiwi,And it’s stupid cause it’s like why me?
22-12-2018T21:19:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not terribly attractive. I’m average at best
22-12-2018T21:19:23,MarshallMelon,Evidently moreso than you think
22-12-2018T21:19:26,SpazztasticKiwi,And I don’t know what interaction got their attention
22-12-2018T21:19:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Or if I even interacted with either guy
22-12-2018T21:20:00,MarshallMelon,"The attractive part, I mean. Not the average part. Poor wording on my end"
22-12-2018T21:20:20,Ordithus,Young woman. People be creepy
22-12-2018T21:21:03,MarshallMelon,People can be desperate. Or maybe you have a physical quality that they're into. These situations can get weird.
22-12-2018T21:21:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"On a lighter note, Bagheera did a tiny sneeze"
22-12-2018T21:22:11,Ordithus,Gesundheidt
22-12-2018T21:22:13,unsteddyphoenix,:D
22-12-2018T21:26:45,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s fighting sleep
22-12-2018T21:27:13,SpazztasticKiwi,And there was another sneeze
22-12-2018T21:29:12,FenceEqualizer,"Have a good night all, going to head out. Happy holidays and Merry Christmas everyone! :ptv-greetings:"
22-12-2018T21:29:25,PalmettoPathfinder1,Merry Christmas Fence!

22-12-2018T22:05:39,SpazztasticKiwi,You know we did our secret Santa at work the 21st
22-12-2018T22:06:21,SpazztasticKiwi,One of our managers was extremely happy over hers - a set of cooking knives
22-12-2018T22:06:37,Bgrmystr2,I have a Ryzen 2600 sitting in my room and I can't use it cuz it's not mine. :(
22-12-2018T22:07:13,SpazztasticKiwi,And I told her “you know you’re an adult when you’re excited about getting silverware
22-12-2018T22:07:16,SpazztasticKiwi,“
22-12-2018T22:07:24,Bgrmystr2,lool

22-12-2018T22:07:34,Bgrmystr2,"hey, it's an expense you don't gotta pay for"
22-12-2018T22:07:36,SpazztasticKiwi,The whole deli thought it was hilarious
22-12-2018T22:07:43,unsteddyphoenix,I had a moment where I was excited that we're gonna get an IKEA in NZ soon
22-12-2018T22:08:03,unsteddyphoenix,"That was a very ""oh god im an adult"" moment"
22-12-2018T22:08:13,unsteddyphoenix,Though I hear they have meatballs :thinking:
22-12-2018T22:08:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Never been to a IKEA so not sure if worthy of excite
22-12-2018T22:09:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve heard ikeas have food shops in the back somewhere
22-12-2018T22:09:25,unsteddyphoenix,But cheap furnatures! :O
22-12-2018T22:09:29,unsteddyphoenix,I could use a new desk
22-12-2018T22:09:35,Bgrmystr2,I've only heard good things about Ikea.. but they do not exist here in Orleans so......... :ptv-unimpressed:
22-12-2018T22:09:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve yet to see one
22-12-2018T22:10:10,Bgrmystr2,I absolutely want an Ikea though
22-12-2018T22:10:22,Bgrmystr2,cuz that'd be super good for getting furniture.
22-12-2018T22:10:34,Bgrmystr2,I want a desk I can set my computer up inside of.
22-12-2018T22:10:39,Bgrmystr2,>;u
22-12-2018T22:11:12,Ordithus,That would be nice
22-12-2018T22:11:24,Bgrmystr2,Yeah
22-12-2018T22:11:31,Bgrmystr2,"I've got a few ideas, nothing in stone yet"
22-12-2018T22:11:35,Ordithus,Right now I need cheap shelves
22-12-2018T22:11:52,Bgrmystr2,I have a crapton of those plastic shelves
22-12-2018T22:11:56,Bgrmystr2,with the tubes and stuff

22-12-2018T22:12:29,Ordithus,Nothing to put things onto
22-12-2018T22:13:28,Bgrmystr2,"I have 18 shelves of the plastic variety just on one wall, a small wooden shelf for my manga and dvds and stuff.."
22-12-2018T22:13:38,Bgrmystr2,but I need to replace all of it
22-12-2018T22:13:55,Bgrmystr2,:/
22-12-2018T22:14:15,Bgrmystr2,I'm lucky to have almost all the stuff I own in this one room lol
22-12-2018T22:14:30,Ordithus,Why do you need to replace?
22-12-2018T22:14:35,RimaDraws,I’m probably gonna clean out my apartment a bit before the end of the year
22-12-2018T22:14:46,RimaDraws,Get rid of things I don’t need
22-12-2018T22:15:02,Bgrmystr2,"the wooden shelf is bending hard, and the plastic shelves are mostly bowling due to weight"
22-12-2018T22:15:10,Bgrmystr2,..bowing*?
22-12-2018T22:15:14,Bgrmystr2,what is the term..
22-12-2018T22:15:31,Ordithus,"Bending, bowing, amends thing"
22-12-2018T22:15:31,Bgrmystr2,it's bowing
22-12-2018T22:15:44,Ordithus,same not amends lol
22-12-2018T22:16:02,Bgrmystr2,"they're all sagging in the middle, all the older white shelves"
22-12-2018T22:16:07,Ordithus,This is what I get for using my phone for once
22-12-2018T22:16:21,Bgrmystr2,I have some new black shelves that are not doing so quite yet
22-12-2018T22:16:33,Ordithus,Keep the heavy things near the corners
22-12-2018T22:16:40,Bgrmystr2,tis what I'm doing
22-12-2018T22:17:07,Ordithus,Then reduce your local gravity vector
22-12-2018T22:17:34,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
