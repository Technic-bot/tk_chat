01-04-2018T00:00:36,TheFDdriver,i want hair like trunks
01-04-2018T00:00:39,unsteddyphoenix,Curly hair would probably be hard to draw

01-04-2018T00:00:50,Kamaro12,lol
01-04-2018T00:00:55,unsteddyphoenix,so drawing would be hard too
01-04-2018T00:01:00,FenceEqualizer,Curly hair or drills?
01-04-2018T00:01:07,TheFDdriver,3x harder
01-04-2018T00:01:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I know. Braids are even more fun
01-04-2018T00:01:21,TheBeckoner,I can agree with Phoenix. Curly hair really like your eyes...

01-04-2018T00:10:25,DarthKeidran,The #NonCanon fanfic writer mindset
01-04-2018T00:10:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Do you really have to be very modest when you’re covered in fur?
01-04-2018T00:10:29,ItsActuallyKopyKat,But only because she wanted everyone to think she was a boy
01-04-2018T00:10:36,Bgrmystr2,guess Fomo never watched the Let It Go movie
01-04-2018T00:10:36,unsteddyphoenix,Apparently yes
01-04-2018T00:10:37,Kamaro12,nat isnt modest

01-04-2018T00:11:05,DarthKeidran,Purdy much @Vexd
01-04-2018T00:11:06,TheFDdriver,thats a long music theme

01-04-2018T00:11:10,Bgrmystr2,at least so you know all the references
01-04-2018T00:11:12,frmCast351,natani was more careful or paranoid than she was modest
01-04-2018T00:11:13,Bgrmystr2,and whether they're good or bad
01-04-2018T00:11:34,unsteddyphoenix,lol
01-04-2018T00:11:43,FenceEqualizer,Raised as a human probably did help to.
01-04-2018T00:11:45,Ordithus,Though will Maren getting comfortable encourage Raine to follow suit?
01-04-2018T00:11:45,frmCast351,it was more of a life/death thing growing up for natani that nobody found out
01-04-2018T00:11:54,ItsActuallyKopyKat,pls ord
01-04-2018T00:11:56,Vatruvius,I think this would be a good color...though I still want to know what is going on with Raine. Must be the subject.
01-04-2018T00:12:00,Dadrobit,Being human also helps.

01-04-2018T00:12:44,ItsActuallyKopyKat,i think it's like 60/40

01-04-2018T00:12:52,Bgrmystr2,the fanservice has simply attracted a large crowd
01-04-2018T00:12:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,that would be rude kiwi
01-04-2018T00:12:54,DarthKeidran,"Like @frmCast351 said. Just look at Natani when she's in the bedroom. Raine be the type of person like me who sleeps in night clothing because we'd otherwise feel, well, naked."

01-04-2018T00:13:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Nah

01-04-2018T00:15:55,Bgrmystr2,My headcanon of Keidran Raine is just human raine with a bunch of fur to make her look like a keidran :P

01-04-2018T00:16:58,FenceEqualizer,He has been gone for a minute.

01-04-2018T00:17:23,SpazztasticKiwi,One regular razor wouldn’t do it
01-04-2018T00:17:26,FenceEqualizer,Would explain why I don't get PTSD from looking at the Kei emote.
01-04-2018T00:17:39,Dadrobit,"The context was there, we had JUST talked about shaving a kiedran"

01-04-2018T00:18:07,Vatruvius,Just a little.
01-04-2018T00:18:08,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"probs, yeah"

01-04-2018T00:18:35,Bgrmystr2,"ah, I see what's bothering Raine now xD"
01-04-2018T00:18:35,DarthKeidran,"@BadFoMo to be honest it was somewhere around April fools. In retrospect, it isn't as funny to think about as it is weird and awkward."
01-04-2018T00:18:35,Ordithus,Haha Raine
01-04-2018T00:18:35,BadFoMo,I love it.

01-04-2018T00:19:23,Ordithus,In this case she just has a crush
01-04-2018T00:19:26,Vatruvius,This is great Tom.
01-04-2018T00:19:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"just attack Raine, you know you want them"
01-04-2018T00:19:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"To be fair, girls do look at their friends boobs. It’s how we let them know something’s off"
01-04-2018T00:19:40,Kamaro12,lol
01-04-2018T00:19:42,Vatruvius,What?!
01-04-2018T00:19:51,FenceEqualizer,My ship is under attack!
01-04-2018T00:19:53,Vatruvius,How does that work? :ptv-wondering:
01-04-2018T00:19:55,TheBeckoner,How would you tell from their boobs?
01-04-2018T00:19:57,DarthKeidran,"So @ItsActuallyKopyKat, what you're trying to say is Raine is a Modest Eric2.0"
01-04-2018T00:19:57,BadFoMo,"""Just pick the lock, don't look at the dogs. Just pick the lock, don't look at the dogs. You looked at the dogs!"""

01-04-2018T00:20:13,DarthKeidran,XD
01-04-2018T00:20:14,Twokinds,Raine's pretty socially inept
01-04-2018T00:20:19,HeresyArtStream,Cute! &lt;3
01-04-2018T00:20:22,Bgrmystr2,poor Raine xD
01-04-2018T00:20:22,SpazztasticKiwi,“You’re chest is lopsided. You need to adjust the right strap”

01-04-2018T00:20:29,TheBeckoner,Thats what happens when your locked in a cabin
01-04-2018T00:20:30,Vexd,Poor girl was raised in an attic
01-04-2018T00:20:30,Vatruvius,Being locked up most of here life may have something to do with it.
01-04-2018T00:20:35,Dadrobit,S'what happens when you're locked up all your life.
01-04-2018T00:20:35,FenceEqualizer,Tom with the interception. My ship is saved
01-04-2018T00:20:36,unsteddyphoenix,Seems like theres a lot of characters like that
01-04-2018T00:20:39,Ordithus,&lt;3
01-04-2018T00:20:41,Vexd,She still needs a huh

01-04-2018T00:20:44,Vexd,*hug
01-04-2018T00:20:47,Bgrmystr2,and he's never to be seen again
01-04-2018T00:20:50,TorqueEmUp,"Makes sense Tom, since she was basically kept in social isolation for a good chunk of her life."
01-04-2018T00:20:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"this good ship, I shall help push"
01-04-2018T00:20:58,WIPKING,Sorry bye
01-04-2018T00:21:00,unsteddyphoenix,"Thats why she expresses her true self in her fanfics, right?"
01-04-2018T00:21:07,TheFDdriver,rip serp
01-04-2018T00:21:08,frmCast351,"yeh, isolation tends to make one like that"
01-04-2018T00:21:08,SpazztasticKiwi,well yes. Friends are different than random guys
01-04-2018T00:21:12,unsteddyphoenix,"Sorry, friendfics"
01-04-2018T00:21:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"If the guy is close enough a friend, it’s possible then too"
01-04-2018T00:21:26,DarthKeidran,"@Twokinds I agree. You all might not realize it, but I'm socially inept like Raine,and for the same reason. My parents are complete and utter tools."

01-04-2018T00:22:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I could see raine being unsure in this situation given her background

01-04-2018T00:22:04,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"uh yeah, dur"

01-04-2018T00:34:28,SpazztasticKiwi,It does seem that a lot of people practically give away their names and info to try becoming famous
01-04-2018T00:35:58,WIPKING,Good night
01-04-2018T00:36:26,TorqueEmUp,"Tom. I apologize for my behavior earlier. I shouldn't have acted the way I did, and could have been far more civilized with voicing my displeasure."
01-04-2018T00:36:52,Mippy,Well...I'm out. It's 11:30 at night and I have classes in the morning. I don't function well without a good amounnt of sleep.

01-04-2018T00:38:40,TorqueEmUp,It wasn't my intention at all to pressure you into streaming.

01-04-2018T00:39:58,TheFDdriver,you missed the stream
01-04-2018T00:40:25,TorqueEmUp,I just get really hotheaded. I am too much like my father when it comes to last minute changes to things.
01-04-2018T00:40:26,GameForge,AGH
01-04-2018T00:40:28,GameForge,MY BRAIN
01-04-2018T00:41:04,TheFDdriver,whats wrong with your brain?
01-04-2018T00:41:08,SpazztasticKiwi,There was a simple stream. Two Tom pick sketches
01-04-2018T00:41:25,unsteddyphoenix,one was a vote
01-04-2018T00:41:27,TorqueEmUp,"I thought one was voted on, and one was a Tom pick"
01-04-2018T00:41:46,SpazztasticKiwi,That went by so quick it was hard to catch the vote
01-04-2018T00:41:51,TheFDdriver,both were tom picks
01-04-2018T00:42:03,TorqueEmUp,Then what was the vote for? :P
01-04-2018T00:42:06,unsteddyphoenix,Nope. One was a vote.
01-04-2018T00:42:07,Ordithus,The Raine and Maren piece was a vote
01-04-2018T00:42:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,it was a good vite
01-04-2018T00:42:24,TheFDdriver,oh
01-04-2018T00:42:29,TorqueEmUp,Could of had more Florence though
01-04-2018T00:42:31,TorqueEmUp,:P
01-04-2018T00:42:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder if Tom ever would do something like that as a pick of his own
01-04-2018T00:42:57,TheFDdriver,maybe?
01-04-2018T00:43:03,TorqueEmUp,Do something like what?
01-04-2018T00:43:06,Ordithus,"Maren's pin up was his pick, months ago"
01-04-2018T00:43:28,WIPKING,Bye
01-04-2018T00:43:34,SpazztasticKiwi,He seems to like the charming character sketches
01-04-2018T00:43:36,TheFDdriver,bye wip
01-04-2018T00:43:41,Ordithus,"He do, he do"
01-04-2018T00:43:42,Dadrobit,"If you're talking about Florence, then yes, he's already done her."
01-04-2018T00:43:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Then again they’re also random at times
01-04-2018T00:44:10,Vatruvius,Who wouldn't like charming characters Kiwi?
01-04-2018T00:44:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Those who prefer the boob-y sketches
01-04-2018T00:44:41,TheFDdriver,"im going to sleep, good night everyone"
01-04-2018T00:44:46,Ordithus,Night FD
01-04-2018T00:44:47,TorqueEmUp,But we can always have more Dadro. I know he has done her before. :P
01-04-2018T00:44:56,Vatruvius,There are too many of those people.
01-04-2018T00:45:08,unsteddyphoenix,Boobs can be charming!
01-04-2018T00:45:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,like keiths
01-04-2018T00:45:20,unsteddyphoenix,^
01-04-2018T00:45:21,TorqueEmUp,Florence doesn't need boobs to be charming. :P
01-04-2018T00:45:23,Vatruvius,Woah...we do not need to know about Dadrobit's bed life.
01-04-2018T00:45:35,unsteddyphoenix,Speak for yourself
01-04-2018T00:45:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"With Florence, boobs would take away the cute"
01-04-2018T00:46:07,FenceEqualizer,^
01-04-2018T00:46:15,SpazztasticKiwi,No need to know Dadrobit’s bed life here either
01-04-2018T00:46:23,TorqueEmUp,"That seems to be the phrase of the day. ""Speak for yourself."""
01-04-2018T00:46:51,Dadrobit,"Eh, it's actually a funny story."
01-04-2018T00:46:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Or anyone’s bed life on the chat. Not necessary info for me
01-04-2018T00:46:53,Bgrmystr2,People like to use words that include others in statements that may not be applicable to everyone
01-04-2018T00:46:55,unsteddyphoenix,Dadrobits bed life is very important

01-04-2018T00:47:42,Dadrobit,So there was this one time down in Mexico....

01-04-2018T00:49:18,FenceEqualizer,Having to dragons in your ear is not the most effective way to silence.
01-04-2018T00:49:21,Vatruvius,No...cannot say I have Kiwi.

01-04-2018T00:54:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Would you rather have more truth or dare questions like “do you have a crush

01-04-2018T00:56:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok then. Who’s your favorite celebrity
01-04-2018T00:56:30,FenceEqualizer,"Hey Tom, May I ask a question?"
01-04-2018T00:56:36,Dadrobit,Yes they can. The internet is my money maker. Gotta keep myself looking professional an' shit.
01-04-2018T00:56:46,unsteddyphoenix,you used up your one question
01-04-2018T00:56:51,FenceEqualizer,Crap!
01-04-2018T00:56:58,Dadrobit,And Ellen
01-04-2018T00:57:11,Vatruvius,Not much of a celebrity person but when it comes to movies I guess Chris Prat.
01-04-2018T00:57:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh she’s funny
01-04-2018T00:57:27,unsteddyphoenix,degeneres?
01-04-2018T00:57:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m torn between Ryan Reynolds and a few others
01-04-2018T00:57:56,SpazztasticKiwi,But I really like Johnny Depp
01-04-2018T00:58:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Jeff Goldblum is all you need

01-04-2018T00:58:32,FenceEqualizer,Fabulously old?
01-04-2018T00:58:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d just ask the question. Tom may or may not still be here
01-04-2018T00:59:18,FenceEqualizer,Don't want to spam the chat with a question if he's not here to answer. Just be taking up internet space.
01-04-2018T00:59:21,SpazztasticKiwi,What’s better in a partner - beauty or character
01-04-2018T00:59:24,Vatruvius,He seems to still be here...he just typed not that long ago.
01-04-2018T00:59:31,Vatruvius,Character.
01-04-2018T00:59:37,Vatruvius,Without a doubt.
01-04-2018T00:59:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,character
01-04-2018T00:59:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I shoot for character personally
01-04-2018T00:59:51,Twokinds,I don't know any celebrities
01-04-2018T00:59:54,FenceEqualizer,Character.
01-04-2018T00:59:55,Vatruvius,Beauty would not hurt...but character.
01-04-2018T01:00:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Not a single celebrity?
01-04-2018T01:00:12,FenceEqualizer,Can I have both?
01-04-2018T01:00:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"just say Jeff Goldblum Tom, Dr. Ian Malcolm from jurassic park"
01-04-2018T01:00:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Do you live under a rock?
01-04-2018T01:00:30,Vatruvius,No...I live in an attic.
01-04-2018T01:00:50,Twokinds,"I mean, I know some of them, in a general sense. but I don't follow any celebrities."
01-04-2018T01:00:59,Twokinds,So I don't have a favorite.
01-04-2018T01:01:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Pirates of the Caribbean fan?
01-04-2018T01:01:11,Vatruvius,With you there Tom...I do not follow any celebrities.
01-04-2018T01:01:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Or do you have a favorite movie at all?
01-04-2018T01:01:26,FenceEqualizer,Same.
01-04-2018T01:01:31,Vatruvius,I do like some PotF from time to time.
01-04-2018T01:01:31,Twokinds,Uh...
01-04-2018T01:01:40,Twokinds,"I saw the first pirates movie, I think"
01-04-2018T01:01:41,Vatruvius,PotC*
01-04-2018T01:01:49,Vatruvius,lol
01-04-2018T01:01:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Gotta watch em all
01-04-2018T01:01:53,Twokinds,I don't watch many movies.
01-04-2018T01:02:10,Vatruvius,Shawshank Redemption is my favorite movie.
01-04-2018T01:02:14,FenceEqualizer,Think it's safe to say he's not a fan.
01-04-2018T01:02:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"I know, you’ve said so. But you can still have a favorite"
01-04-2018T01:02:52,Twokinds,Star Wars
01-04-2018T01:02:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t you like My Neighboor Turoto (I know that name’s misspelled)
01-04-2018T01:03:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Never seen Star Wars myself
01-04-2018T01:03:10,BearFlipsTable,aw stream over? ah well
01-04-2018T01:03:19,Twokinds,You're dead to me
01-04-2018T01:03:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok
01-04-2018T01:03:30,TheBeckoner,Shawshank redemption is among my favorites.
01-04-2018T01:03:34,Vatruvius,lol
01-04-2018T01:03:39,Vatruvius,Tom
01-04-2018T01:03:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
01-04-2018T01:03:46,BearFlipsTable,star wars? tbh i only really got into that last year is p cool
01-04-2018T01:03:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Can’t help it. I’ve never had the time
01-04-2018T01:04:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Or anyone to share it with
01-04-2018T01:04:06,Twokinds,For the longest time that's all I had
01-04-2018T01:04:13,TheBeckoner,Star wars is neat. Nothin I geek out over
01-04-2018T01:04:16,Twokinds,"a tv, a vcr, and a box set of star wars."
01-04-2018T01:04:23,Twokinds,So I watched them over and over.
01-04-2018T01:04:24,Dadrobit,"Back, was getting a drink. And yes, unstedy, Degenerese."
01-04-2018T01:04:53,BearFlipsTable,"had the boxset as a kid, tv n vcr but didnt watch it"
01-04-2018T01:05:17,BearFlipsTable,not til a few years ago
01-04-2018T01:05:25,Vatruvius,Star Wars really hit my parents so it became a part of me. I do like them...but my favorite of all of them is Rogue One. I like the change of pace and the not perfect hero ending.
01-04-2018T01:05:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though being dead to you’s a little bit of a jump, don’t you think"
01-04-2018T01:05:43,unsteddyphoenix,See I just recorded episodes of DBZ and pokemon on VCR and watchted taht over and over
01-04-2018T01:06:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"My dad never allowed that kind of thing in the house either, so"
01-04-2018T01:06:02,Twokinds,"Fine, you're alive to me again."
01-04-2018T01:06:10,Vatruvius,You are not dead to me Kiwi...despite your short falls when it comes to movies. Luckily they can still be watched.
01-04-2018T01:06:14,Dadrobit,"Oh jeez, recording episode... I almost forgot about doing that."
01-04-2018T01:06:19,Dadrobit,episodes*
01-04-2018T01:06:31,Twokinds,Recording? I did not have such luxuries.
01-04-2018T01:06:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,recorded episodes of yugioh as a kid
01-04-2018T01:06:36,Twokinds,I had to hope it wasn't a rerun.
01-04-2018T01:06:53,Twokinds,And hope I didn't miss one
01-04-2018T01:06:55,BearFlipsTable,"i was too busy when i was a little kid watching Doctor Who, LOTR and Harry Potter"
01-04-2018T01:07:08,Dadrobit,"Parents were split, and the egg doner was the parent that let me watch TV, so she'd record them for me on the weekends I wasn't at her house."
01-04-2018T01:07:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Never seen Harry Potter or Dr Who either
01-04-2018T01:07:24,Vatruvius,That reminds me...I really like the recent Hobbit series.
01-04-2018T01:07:27,BearFlipsTable,bro...
01-04-2018T01:07:30,Twokinds,ok w hat
01-04-2018T01:07:32,BearFlipsTable,jk
01-04-2018T01:07:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Seen a little of the LOTR and Hobbit though
01-04-2018T01:07:42,BearFlipsTable,*rowling*
01-04-2018T01:07:49,Vatruvius,With you there Kiwi...well...I watched parts of Harry Potter and could not get into the whole series.
01-04-2018T01:08:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"Like I said, dad didn’t allow that kind of thing in the house"
01-04-2018T01:08:27,Vatruvius,Why is that Kiwi?
01-04-2018T01:08:28,BearFlipsTable,tbh i didnt get into HP til the third movie because i was too young when the first film cameout to really appreciate it
01-04-2018T01:08:32,Vatruvius,Something against movies?
01-04-2018T01:08:33,FenceEqualizer,"Going to be of topic a sec. Hey Tom, a quick question about your comic. It may seem silly to ask but are there other human ethnics and cultures in your world? Like are there places that have more of a Asian thematic, African, Samoan? That sort of thing?"
01-04-2018T01:08:40,SpazztasticKiwi,He believed it was witchcraft
01-04-2018T01:08:47,FenceEqualizer,God that was hell to type on the phone.
01-04-2018T01:08:47,Dadrobit,The Hobbit trilogy was a good time. Picked up the set plus the original LotR and binged watched all of them in order last year.
01-04-2018T01:08:53,TheBeckoner,lol I knew someone like that Kiwi
01-04-2018T01:08:59,SpazztasticKiwi,He was mentally ill. And he drank. Not a good combo
01-04-2018T01:09:03,Twokinds,"There are other cultures, but it's not as diverse as that"
01-04-2018T01:09:08,TheBeckoner,She thought Star Wars was devil worship
01-04-2018T01:09:17,BearFlipsTable,"nah. first hobbit was good, 2nd was alright 3rd was ridiculous"
01-04-2018T01:09:20,Twokinds,"It's more like, the difference between Scots and Brits"
01-04-2018T01:09:24,Vatruvius,I fell sorry for you Kiwi.
01-04-2018T01:09:25,TheBeckoner,"ah I retract my ""lol"""
01-04-2018T01:09:44,Dadrobit,"Step Mom was a part of the ""DnD is for Devil Worshippers"" crowd for a while."
01-04-2018T01:09:54,BearFlipsTable,"third hobbit completely strayed from the book, which yes they can do but imo it was bad"
01-04-2018T01:09:56,SpazztasticKiwi,It not like I remember him very well anymore
01-04-2018T01:10:26,BearFlipsTable,"daddy rob, does she like the film dark dungeons"
01-04-2018T01:10:27,TheBeckoner,My friends mom thought pokemon were demons come to think of it...
01-04-2018T01:10:31,SpazztasticKiwi,But I have been interested in trying Star Wars and Trek
01-04-2018T01:10:33,FenceEqualizer,"Ahh, okay that makes sense. Was always curious about that and the diversity of the world."
01-04-2018T01:10:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Never gotten to it yet though
01-04-2018T01:11:10,Vatruvius,The entire Hobbit movies strayed from the book when they let Azog live. But that was the point...to bring in action. Would have been a short kid movie otherwise.
01-04-2018T01:11:18,TheBeckoner,I like Star Trek in general. Never got super into it
01-04-2018T01:11:27,Dadrobit,Not sure what you're talking about Bear
01-04-2018T01:11:38,BearFlipsTable,if they kept in everything in the forest holy craphow long a film would that be
01-04-2018T01:11:46,SpazztasticKiwi,The Hobbit and LOTR was ok I guess but I’m not sure I paid a lot of attention
01-04-2018T01:11:49,BearFlipsTable,nvm rob
01-04-2018T01:11:49,Twokinds,That would have been such a foreign concept to my young self's mind
01-04-2018T01:11:54,SpazztasticKiwi,What
01-04-2018T01:12:06,Twokinds,"When I was little, the original Star Wars wasn't even a movie."
01-04-2018T01:12:24,Twokinds,It was just a... thing that exists. Everyone saw it. It was it's own classification of media.
01-04-2018T01:12:25,SpazztasticKiwi,You’re also a bit older than me
01-04-2018T01:12:25,BearFlipsTable,oh?
01-04-2018T01:12:34,BearFlipsTable,tom is like 12 years older than me
01-04-2018T01:12:39,Vatruvius,It was really big when it was first released.
01-04-2018T01:12:48,TheBeckoner,Like YouTube vs TV?
01-04-2018T01:13:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"9 years isn’t a whole lot, but it’s evidently enough"
01-04-2018T01:13:23,Twokinds,"No, I mean, I was little. I didn't have solid concepts. I just knew there were movies, and then Star Wars"
01-04-2018T01:13:37,TheBeckoner,Ohh
01-04-2018T01:13:45,Vatruvius,You could say the Beck...Star Wars really changed how movies were seen.
01-04-2018T01:13:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Ahhh
01-04-2018T01:14:27,TheBeckoner,Weird. I have always sorted movies from Tv or other
01-04-2018T01:14:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve seen a little of some Star Trek. I know some references. My mom likes it pretty well
01-04-2018T01:14:36,TheBeckoner,My mom too
01-04-2018T01:14:47,BearFlipsTable,never seen star trek
01-04-2018T01:14:52,TheBeckoner,She likes it a ton actually
01-04-2018T01:14:53,SpazztasticKiwi,But I only got to see snippets when my dad wasn’t around
01-04-2018T01:15:23,Vatruvius,Both my parents are in there own when it comes to movies and view video games as an evil that consumes all and ruins lives. But they seem okay if I go to program them.
01-04-2018T01:15:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"When Harry Potter came out, I was forbidden to read it"
01-04-2018T01:15:38,TheBeckoner,Dang
01-04-2018T01:15:42,BearFlipsTable,y?? ;-;
01-04-2018T01:15:44,SpazztasticKiwi,So I never got the chance to try
01-04-2018T01:15:46,BearFlipsTable,harry tho
01-04-2018T01:15:47,TheBeckoner,I dislike long reads so I never didi
01-04-2018T01:15:49,Twokinds,I've seen most Star Trek
01-04-2018T01:15:57,BearFlipsTable,is good?
01-04-2018T01:16:01,Vatruvius,I could not read the books either. Just not my kind of fiction.
01-04-2018T01:16:02,Twokinds,Of course
01-04-2018T01:16:05,BearFlipsTable,aye aye
01-04-2018T01:16:09,Dadrobit,"I've seen most of the movies, but almost none of the show..."
01-04-2018T01:16:17,FenceEqualizer,Did you have some super religious parents Kiwi.?
01-04-2018T01:16:19,TheBeckoner,THe show is where its at imo
01-04-2018T01:16:22,Twokinds,"I haven't seen movie of the original series, but I've seen TNG, Voyager, DS9, and a lot of the movies."
01-04-2018T01:16:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Just my dad
01-04-2018T01:16:24,unsteddyphoenix,samd dad
01-04-2018T01:16:30,BearFlipsTable,i havent seen star trek but i know bits n pieces
01-04-2018T01:16:30,unsteddyphoenix,Ive watched like none of the show
01-04-2018T01:16:35,BearFlipsTable,and riker is perf
01-04-2018T01:17:08,Vatruvius,I watched the Star Trek movies...I rather liked them but I was way too young for the show so I have been told the oldies are better.
01-04-2018T01:17:09,TheBeckoner,I liked Voyager pretty good. It was what I grew up seeing tho so I may be biased
01-04-2018T01:18:01,Twokinds,The Next Generation is probably still my favorite of all the serieses
01-04-2018T01:18:01,Vatruvius,I should clarify that I have watched the new movies.
01-04-2018T01:18:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"And I do live in the Bible Belt, though it was mainly superstition that fueled the bans"
01-04-2018T01:18:20,Vatruvius,Bible Belt?
01-04-2018T01:18:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Google it
01-04-2018T01:18:28,BearFlipsTable,oh dear
01-04-2018T01:18:31,unsteddyphoenix,"What about Harry potter, that was out?"
01-04-2018T01:18:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Big time
01-04-2018T01:18:45,FenceEqualizer,Magic is santanic.
01-04-2018T01:18:46,BearFlipsTable,i cry for u friend
01-04-2018T01:18:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t have to worry about it now
01-04-2018T01:18:57,TheBeckoner,Oops brain fart. I meant Enterprise. So I guess that would be next gen
01-04-2018T01:19:12,FenceEqualizer,And demons. The lord shall not abide by your evil books.
01-04-2018T01:19:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Though at this point I’m not sure I’d enjoy it as much
01-04-2018T01:19:44,BearFlipsTable,"gimme an americans opnion, how religious is your country, really?"
01-04-2018T01:19:50,FenceEqualizer,The super religious hurts.
01-04-2018T01:19:55,BearFlipsTable,"or even, where u guys live"
01-04-2018T01:19:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Didn’t get to try dating until later in life because of him either
01-04-2018T01:20:16,FenceEqualizer,Pretty Religious.  Though most won't bother you or bat a eye to such things
01-04-2018T01:20:31,BearFlipsTable,it scares me tbh
01-04-2018T01:20:34,TheBeckoner,"I remember I wasnt aloud to watch Episode 3 for some reason, but the others where fine"
01-04-2018T01:20:46,unsteddyphoenix,Werewolf
01-04-2018T01:20:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"I was raised a certain way, but I’ve made my own viewpoint with it"
01-04-2018T01:21:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,someone say werewolves?
01-04-2018T01:21:18,BearFlipsTable,werewolves are awesome
01-04-2018T01:21:23,BearFlipsTable,love werewolves
01-04-2018T01:21:26,FenceEqualizer,Shouldn't be really religious people are normal as you and me. But just like everything there's always going to be a loud minority of nutters.
01-04-2018T01:21:29,unsteddyphoenix,I wish I had the star war as a kid now I don't have the same level of nostalgia
01-04-2018T01:21:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Dog soldiers is best werewolf movie
01-04-2018T01:21:36,Vatruvius,I was raised catholic but I have turned agnostic...my parents seem to want to deny it and make me life a lie though.
01-04-2018T01:21:37,BearFlipsTable,same unsteddy
01-04-2018T01:21:49,TheBeckoner,Welp sleep calls my name...Night y'all. Thanks for the stream Tom.
01-04-2018T01:21:51,FenceEqualizer,OMG Marv &lt;3 Dog soldiers.
01-04-2018T01:22:00,Vatruvius,Goodnight Beck!
01-04-2018T01:22:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Yo \o/
01-04-2018T01:22:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I was born and raised Baptist
01-04-2018T01:22:14,BearFlipsTable,"one my fave eps of Doctor Who, series 2 ep, tooth n claw the werewolf in that is freaking awesome, look it up"
01-04-2018T01:22:17,FenceEqualizer,Night Beck
01-04-2018T01:22:19,Dadrobit,night beck
01-04-2018T01:22:20,BearFlipsTable,nighty night beck
01-04-2018T01:22:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night becky
01-04-2018T01:22:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not as gung-ho as most of my family can be
01-04-2018T01:22:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Why do you think I wanted to move
01-04-2018T01:23:04,BearFlipsTable,aha
01-04-2018T01:23:05,BearFlipsTable,truu
01-04-2018T01:23:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Fence on a scale of 1 to 10 how badass is spoon in dog soldiers
01-04-2018T01:23:40,SpazztasticKiwi,California meant being close to my grandpa but also being close to my uncle so that was kinda struck out
01-04-2018T01:23:45,FenceEqualizer,11 out of 10
01-04-2018T01:23:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Plus it’s expensive
01-04-2018T01:23:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,right answer XD
01-04-2018T01:23:58,FenceEqualizer,Guy went toe to toe barehandedish with a werewolf
01-04-2018T01:24:13,FenceEqualizer,Welp going to now watch the entire movie on youtube.
01-04-2018T01:24:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"Then I thought about Illinois, but I’m not sure about those relatives"
01-04-2018T01:24:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I have the dvd fence
01-04-2018T01:24:37,BearFlipsTable,awoo
01-04-2018T01:25:16,FenceEqualizer,Unfortunately my old dvd got scratched by a vindictive dvd/vcr combo  player..
01-04-2018T01:25:19,Vatruvius,That is a shame...it is rather nice here in California but if getting away from family is what you are trying to do then I can see why it would be crossed out. Also...it is quite pricey.
01-04-2018T01:25:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Ohio was a thought but it’s cold and people thought I was trying to be a stalker
01-04-2018T01:25:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"rip, I'm sure you can find a new one for cheap fence"
01-04-2018T01:25:57,BearFlipsTable,Remus' werewolf was dissapointing to say the least
01-04-2018T01:26:01,BearFlipsTable,(in HP)
01-04-2018T01:26:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Ive been told there may be cousins or something there too
01-04-2018T01:26:19,Vatruvius,Makes sense if your uncle is here.
01-04-2018T01:26:28,SpazztasticKiwi,My uncle is bad news
01-04-2018T01:26:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Very bad
01-04-2018T01:26:35,BearFlipsTable,is it ok if i put a link in?
01-04-2018T01:26:45,FenceEqualizer,R.I.P wallet.
01-04-2018T01:26:46,unsteddyphoenix,I will allow
01-04-2018T01:26:56,Vatruvius,He is your father's brother...huh?
01-04-2018T01:26:59,BearFlipsTable,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myjd4uoq6dY
01-04-2018T01:27:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Unsteddy for mod 2016
01-04-2018T01:27:09,BearFlipsTable,doctor who werewolf it is guuuuud
01-04-2018T01:27:13,FenceEqualizer,After all the over time i've been doing I said screw it and just bought the bluray version.
01-04-2018T01:27:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Yep dad’s little brother
01-04-2018T01:27:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Even his sisters don’t want him around anymore
01-04-2018T01:27:55,unsteddyphoenix,thats pretty good werewolf effect
01-04-2018T01:28:01,BearFlipsTable,aye aye
01-04-2018T01:28:01,unsteddyphoenix,Especially for doctor who
01-04-2018T01:28:14,BearFlipsTable,these days Doctor Who has gone to shit
01-04-2018T01:28:18,BearFlipsTable,i dont like it anymore
01-04-2018T01:28:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I wanna post the spoon vs werewolf but its pretty violent
01-04-2018T01:28:30,BearFlipsTable,before 12 was good now its bleh
01-04-2018T01:28:32,SpazztasticKiwi,But I think the main thing I’d like is enough elbow room that constant visits aren’t necessary
01-04-2018T01:28:36,Vatruvius,Well I am sorry your family is the way it is Kiwi...at least you are old enough to make your own decision and lead your own life.
01-04-2018T01:29:02,unsteddyphoenix,"I will allow it as long as you put ""NSFW"" next to it"
01-04-2018T01:29:11,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s not too bad. I count a lot of my friends as family anymore
01-04-2018T01:29:25,Vatruvius,That is good.
01-04-2018T01:29:40,SpazztasticKiwi,The major problem I have is dating
01-04-2018T01:29:55,SpazztasticKiwi,My mother hasn’t like a single guy I’ve taken an interest in
01-04-2018T01:30:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,well violent and has harsh language
01-04-2018T01:30:03,Vatruvius,I am over here complaining about my rather tame and very good life and you are here giving a real story to feel sorry for.
01-04-2018T01:30:28,unsteddyphoenix,"Make sure you say ""warning naughty evil words"""
01-04-2018T01:30:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I rant a lot
01-04-2018T01:30:30,Vatruvius,Your mother has certain requirements?
01-04-2018T01:30:38,FenceEqualizer,"Huh, doctor who did have a good werewolf. Was expecting hairy man werewolf"
01-04-2018T01:30:44,BearFlipsTable,nah dude

01-04-2018T01:31:15,FenceEqualizer,^ watch this.
01-04-2018T01:31:25,BearFlipsTable,2005 onwards to the eleventh doctor they had awesome stuff now its crap
01-04-2018T01:31:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"I know she want someone who can “help provide”, but I really want to focus on how the guy treats me first and foremost, you know"
01-04-2018T01:32:01,unsteddyphoenix,Is this movie a comedy?
01-04-2018T01:32:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,thats spoon
01-04-2018T01:32:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"Not rich, but had a steady job"
01-04-2018T01:32:20,FenceEqualizer,Spoon best soldier.
01-04-2018T01:32:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"to summarize, British SAS vs werewolves"
01-04-2018T01:32:45,BearFlipsTable,was just gonna say is this a comedy
01-04-2018T01:32:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,its an epic
01-04-2018T01:33:03,BearFlipsTable,it seems like a film nick frost and simon pegg would star in
01-04-2018T01:33:20,Vatruvius,I understand. My dad was raised on the principal of being able to provide for the family and he is the same way. Though he found my mom...most times it will not work out on just that principal.
01-04-2018T01:33:32,BearFlipsTable,"also, is he punching a werewolf."
01-04-2018T01:33:37,BearFlipsTable,what even dude
01-04-2018T01:33:49,unsteddyphoenix,his scream is hilarious
01-04-2018T01:33:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"sas member, fight till you die"
01-04-2018T01:33:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Exactly
01-04-2018T01:33:54,FenceEqualizer,Yes for Spoon is Triple S tier
01-04-2018T01:34:02,BearFlipsTable,hecc
01-04-2018T01:34:03,FenceEqualizer,He only lost cause the other werewolf was a punk
01-04-2018T01:34:06,Dadrobit,I love that creaming he does near the end
01-04-2018T01:34:12,Dadrobit,screaming**********
01-04-2018T01:34:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I wanna be like spoon when I grow up
01-04-2018T01:34:28,Vatruvius,lol

01-04-2018T01:34:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m waiting to be away so I can start dating again without her being able to nose into the whole thing
01-04-2018T01:34:42,Vatruvius,great one
01-04-2018T01:35:02,BearFlipsTable,another film with alright-ish werewolves is van helsing
01-04-2018T01:35:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"Robit, your spelling is going wacky again"
01-04-2018T01:35:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Just a little
01-04-2018T01:35:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,any movie with hugh jackman has good werewolves
01-04-2018T01:35:29,Vatruvius,Sounds like a plan. I have been waiting on a relationship just because I have not found anyone I though I would potentially spend the rest of my life with.
01-04-2018T01:35:30,Dadrobit,Legitimately completly honest mistake
01-04-2018T01:35:33,Dadrobit,Scout's honor
01-04-2018T01:35:39,BearFlipsTable,was it tho. was it?
01-04-2018T01:35:52,FenceEqualizer,Other werewolf was scared to take him on in a 1 on 1 so had to sneak up on him.
01-04-2018T01:36:07,FenceEqualizer,Cursed had a funny werewolf.
01-04-2018T01:36:11,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I wish I were as clever as I am when I'm making mistakes"
01-04-2018T01:36:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Do we want to return to random questions now that we’ve covered a tangent subject?
01-04-2018T01:36:41,Vatruvius,Probably a good idea.
01-04-2018T01:36:59,BearFlipsTable,"its oke daddy i once said to someone how fast do u want me when i meant ""wow how fast do u want me gone?"""
01-04-2018T01:37:00,Vatruvius,Though Doctor Who and SAS seem to be on the rage right now.
01-04-2018T01:37:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Favorite animal (specifically - not cat or dog)
01-04-2018T01:37:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,SAS are some of the most badass soldiers on the planet
01-04-2018T01:37:35,Vatruvius,Wolf...I rather like them and what they symbolize.
01-04-2018T01:37:46,BearFlipsTable,wolves are flipping awesome
01-04-2018T01:37:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m partial to the snow leopard
01-04-2018T01:37:59,Vatruvius,I am not dissing the SAS Marv...they are cool.
01-04-2018T01:38:03,Dadrobit,Cheetahs yo

01-04-2018T01:38:22,FenceEqualizer,Well was Dolphins... now I don't have one.

01-04-2018T01:39:14,unsteddyphoenix,"ooo, Maine Coons."
01-04-2018T01:39:19,Vatruvius,Plus the habitat they live and hunt in is getting smaller every year making it more difficult.
01-04-2018T01:39:21,BearFlipsTable,i got a lil cat next to me rn

01-04-2018T01:41:36,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s so funny

01-04-2018T01:58:11,Vatruvius,What are you looking forward to?
01-04-2018T01:58:24,Dadrobit,Ghetto
01-04-2018T01:58:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Meeting Seán Ethan and Mark
01-04-2018T01:58:43,SpazztasticKiwi,And seeing all the booths
01-04-2018T01:58:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Give them hugs in our name
01-04-2018T01:59:03,Vatruvius,Like finding them walking around/picture?
01-04-2018T01:59:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Hopefully
01-04-2018T01:59:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I really want to see if Subnautica has a booth though
01-04-2018T01:59:52,SpazztasticKiwi,My friend is going to be looking for the Kingdom Hearts booth
01-04-2018T02:00:26,Dadrobit,"Nah, the guests don't loiter around. They all use the back non-public hallways. You're gonna have to go to one of their designated signing/pictures booth times."
01-04-2018T02:00:44,Vatruvius,"If you like fantasy at all, jokes, and some good fun look for tge D&D Aquistions Incorporated. I am pretty sure they are doing a thing at PAX East."
01-04-2018T02:00:46,SpazztasticKiwi,They walk around the floor. They’ve said so
01-04-2018T02:01:01,Dadrobit,Good luck
01-04-2018T02:01:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though if they don’t, there’ll be plenty of entertainment"
01-04-2018T02:01:48,Vatruvius,"If ""green flame"" gets mentioned at all, shout ""green flame."""
01-04-2018T02:02:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"My main issue is the travel from the airport to hotel. Bus or taxi, straight there and straight back"
01-04-2018T02:02:16,Vatruvius,Uber? Lyft?
01-04-2018T02:02:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Hotel is a walk across the street to the con
01-04-2018T02:02:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe Uber
01-04-2018T02:03:05,SpazztasticKiwi,My hope is we find other con goers and walk with them
01-04-2018T02:03:42,Vatruvius,I am sure there will be plenty. Right across the street is pretty good too.
01-04-2018T02:04:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Welp gonna go pass out, Nighty night Ya'll &lt;3"
01-04-2018T02:04:15,Dadrobit,Night Marv
01-04-2018T02:04:32,Vatruvius,Goodnight!
01-04-2018T02:04:42,FenceEqualizer,Good night Marv!
01-04-2018T02:04:58,FenceEqualizer,Should be heading to bed myself. You lot have a good time
01-04-2018T02:05:10,Vatruvius,You too Marv.
01-04-2018T02:05:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Nite
01-04-2018T02:05:28,Dadrobit,Night Fence
01-04-2018T02:06:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I might go back to YouTube before going to bed
01-04-2018T02:06:44,Vatruvius,I am just chillin on Spotify and this chat. No other plans.
01-04-2018T02:07:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera’s up. He’s never gonna sleep though the night now
01-04-2018T02:07:37,Vatruvius,Oops.
01-04-2018T02:08:20,SpazztasticKiwi,He normally wakes up when he hears YouTube anyway
01-04-2018T02:08:39,Vatruvius,No headphones?
01-04-2018T02:09:07,SpazztasticKiwi,No. I’m back at the other end of the house. Likes to waythe screen move I guess
01-04-2018T02:09:23,SpazztasticKiwi,*Likes the way the
01-04-2018T02:10:12,Vatruvius,Hmm...what does that have to do with headphones? Or am I totally missing it here?
01-04-2018T02:10:43,SpazztasticKiwi,He watches probably because of the movement on screen
01-04-2018T02:11:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t watch wit headphones because I’m at the other end of the house
01-04-2018T02:11:31,Vatruvius,My dogs do the same sometimes. Npt on my phone...on the TV.
01-04-2018T02:11:43,SpazztasticKiwi,And watching with headphones can cause hearing damage if you’re watching the right people
01-04-2018T02:11:47,Vatruvius,Not*
01-04-2018T02:12:12,Vatruvius,You mean Mark...yeah...I get that.
01-04-2018T02:12:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Jack actually
01-04-2018T02:12:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark can get loud too though
01-04-2018T02:13:01,Vatruvius,Mark + Rage Games = Deafness
01-04-2018T02:13:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I turn my volume waaaay down
01-04-2018T02:13:52,Vatruvius,I keep my volume down on everything too. I can not stand things being loud.
01-04-2018T02:15:39,SpazztasticKiwi,My sister once heard me watching Mark play a horror game
01-04-2018T02:15:54,SpazztasticKiwi,After awhile she asked me if the screaming guy was ok
01-04-2018T02:16:03,Vatruvius,Lol
01-04-2018T02:16:12,SpazztasticKiwi,“Nah that’s normal”
01-04-2018T02:17:02,Vatruvius,"Chair out the window...*crash*...Mark, ""I...am fine!"""
01-04-2018T02:17:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I think the chair begs to differ
01-04-2018T02:17:46,Vatruvius,Well yse...yes it does.
01-04-2018T02:18:08,SpazztasticKiwi,You’re not fine if you have to scream it at me
01-04-2018T02:18:50,Vatruvius,What are you talking about? That is the first sign of things being okay.
01-04-2018T02:19:13,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s funny and concerning at the same time
01-04-2018T02:19:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Mostly concerning
01-04-2018T02:19:53,Vatruvius,Poor Mark...it is so funny but I feel like a rage game will literaly end him.
01-04-2018T02:20:12,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s not getting any younger
01-04-2018T02:20:53,Vatruvius,"He needs to watch for that...like a stress meter that says ""time to take a break."""
01-04-2018T02:21:30,SpazztasticKiwi,“Turn off the game Mark. I have detected elevated stress levels”
01-04-2018T02:22:13,Vatruvius,"GladOS voice and all. Of course, with the voice comes the sarcasm."
01-04-2018T02:22:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though harping on it hasn’t worked in the past, so I doubt it ever will"
01-04-2018T02:22:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"If he feels he’s ok, he’s ok"
01-04-2018T02:23:31,Vatruvius,Well...he keeps doing it. A good rage game is a good work out sometimes.
01-04-2018T02:23:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Can be a stress reliever too. Take your anger out on something
01-04-2018T02:24:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Even if it is swearing profusely at a computer
01-04-2018T02:24:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"If it works, it works"
01-04-2018T02:24:32,Vatruvius,Yes...usually results in the spending of money though.
01-04-2018T02:24:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Eh. That’s his business
01-04-2018T02:25:26,Vatruvius,He makes more then he breaks.
01-04-2018T02:25:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t make a habit of discussing other’s money
01-04-2018T02:26:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Media focuses on it too much as it is
01-04-2018T02:27:11,Vatruvius,Well...if he didn't he could not keep doing youtube videos. But I know what you mean. People get cought up in figures and stuff...g e ts nasty fast just like polotics.
01-04-2018T02:31:10,Vatruvius,I am loterally closing my eyes. I just woke up...so goodnight Kiwi. Have fun at PAX!
01-04-2018T02:31:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"If it weren’t for him, I’d never found Tom though"
01-04-2018T02:31:30,Vatruvius,Same Kiwi.
01-04-2018T02:31:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Gn then 🌝
01-04-2018T02:31:44,Vatruvius,Goodnight!
01-04-2018T02:31:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll try to have all the fun possible
01-04-2018T02:32:00,Dadrobit,have a good one
01-04-2018T02:32:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Creeper
01-04-2018T02:33:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I need to go to bed soon to. But I don’t know when soon is
01-04-2018T02:33:14,SpazztasticKiwi,*too
01-04-2018T02:34:27,DarthRexKing,Goodnight everyone. Later.
01-04-2018T02:35:39,Dadrobit,Night all y'all that are leaving
01-04-2018T02:35:55,DarthRexKing,Later.
01-04-2018T02:54:35,SpazztasticKiwi,What’s everyone else doing
01-04-2018T02:54:51,Dadrobit,ESO
01-04-2018T02:55:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Ooo games late at night
01-04-2018T02:55:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Better than caffeine
01-04-2018T02:55:55,Dadrobit,It's gosh darn crack is what it is.
01-04-2018T02:56:18,SpazztasticKiwi,One...more...hour
01-04-2018T02:56:31,Dadrobit,One... More... Quest...
01-04-2018T02:56:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Just one
01-04-2018T02:56:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Then I’ll go to bed
01-04-2018T02:57:07,SpazztasticKiwi,“6 hours later”
01-04-2018T02:57:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m gonna go get ready for bed
01-04-2018T02:58:17,Dadrobit,"Right on, just gonna finish up this questline and then do the same."
01-04-2018T02:58:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Chat seems to have dwindled and I’m not sure about what to chatter about with just Tom and a few others
01-04-2018T02:59:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"Might pop in one more time a little later, but I’m likely off to bed"
01-04-2018T02:59:28,Dadrobit,Have a good one
01-04-2018T03:02:21,SpazztasticKiwi,🖖🏻 you too
01-04-2018T03:04:14,Dadrobit,:tumbler_glass:

01-04-2018T03:26:38,Dadrobit,:ptv-shock:
01-04-2018T03:27:37,unsteddyphoenix,Lol you're both still awake :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
01-04-2018T03:27:44,unsteddyphoenix,"Say, what time do you guys wake up?"
01-04-2018T03:28:16,Dadrobit,Around 9am
01-04-2018T03:28:22,Twokinds,"Varies widely. I woke up noon 'today', and 4:30pm the previous day."
01-04-2018T03:28:45,unsteddyphoenix,That's a variation yeah.
01-04-2018T03:28:51,Twokinds,4:30pm was an anomoly. Usually around 12-1pm
01-04-2018T03:29:10,unsteddyphoenix,Dad you really wake up at 9?  Damn.
01-04-2018T03:29:33,Dadrobit,I certainly try. Sometimes I hit snooze until 10-10:30
01-04-2018T03:29:56,Dadrobit,But I have classes that mandate that I am awake by a certai time.
01-04-2018T03:30:40,unsteddyphoenix,See I aim for 10 and go up to like 12
01-04-2018T03:30:51,Twokinds,Having to abid by no alarm clock is half the reason I work for myself!
01-04-2018T03:31:14,unsteddyphoenix,"I can defintely, see the appeal."
01-04-2018T03:31:44,unsteddyphoenix,"Right now all I have to wake up for is the streams, but idk. I dont like sleeping past noon anyway"
01-04-2018T03:31:58,Twokinds,I wouldn't if I could
01-04-2018T03:32:25,Dadrobit,:/ One last semester and I'll be home free...
01-04-2018T03:32:48,unsteddyphoenix,You can do it! :D
01-04-2018T03:33:38,Bgrmystr2,I kinda wake up whenever my body wakes up.. between 2 and 4.. though I have like 3 or 4 alarms to wake me up if it passes 2pm. Not that it matters cuz I turn that shit off literally while I am sleeping and don't remember doing it when I wake up..
01-04-2018T03:34:08,unsteddyphoenix,That's...really inconvinient.
01-04-2018T03:34:11,Bgrmystr2,at this point.. alarms mean nothing to me :/
01-04-2018T03:34:15,Dadrobit,Just had to kill a good friend in ESO... Really don't want to end the night on a sad note...
01-04-2018T03:34:29,unsteddyphoenix,...PVP?
01-04-2018T03:34:36,Dadrobit,NPC friend
01-04-2018T03:34:46,Dadrobit,"But he's actually the best,"
01-04-2018T03:34:51,Bgrmystr2,aw rip
01-04-2018T03:34:53,Dadrobit,Except I just killed him
01-04-2018T03:34:54,Bgrmystr2,why you have to kill?
01-04-2018T03:34:58,unsteddyphoenix,D:
01-04-2018T03:35:08,Dadrobit,For the glory of the Aldemeri Dominion.
01-04-2018T03:35:36,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-uneasy: He was not a fan how you were doing things, I take it?"
01-04-2018T03:36:18,Dadrobit,"Exact opposite. He was best friend, one of the first you meet."
01-04-2018T03:36:28,Bgrmystr2,oh
01-04-2018T03:36:44,Bgrmystr2,can't convert him to your cause or whatever..?
01-04-2018T03:36:50,Bgrmystr2,or take him on as ally?
01-04-2018T03:36:51,Dadrobit,And he ordered me to sacrifice him by destroying a relic that set off traps that killed him
01-04-2018T03:37:00,Bgrmystr2,whaat
01-04-2018T03:37:03,Bgrmystr2,nooooo
01-04-2018T03:37:05,Bgrmystr2,best friend
01-04-2018T03:37:09,unsteddyphoenix,Thats so...dramatic.
01-04-2018T03:37:17,Bgrmystr2,was it for a good cause?
01-04-2018T03:37:27,Bgrmystr2,what did you gain by his sacrifice?
01-04-2018T03:37:32,unsteddyphoenix,MMOs stories arent normally that strong
01-04-2018T03:37:34,unsteddyphoenix,Exp!
01-04-2018T03:37:58,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
01-04-2018T03:38:05,Dadrobit,Destroyed a crown that would have fallen into an enemy General's hands. The crown has the ability to control all elves.
01-04-2018T03:38:11,Dadrobit,Had to be destroyed
01-04-2018T03:38:17,Bgrmystr2,holy shit
01-04-2018T03:38:33,Dadrobit,But he was trapped on the other side of a gate with his exit completely blocked.
01-04-2018T03:39:09,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-shock: May he forever rest in peace, his sacrifice never forgotten. o7 ;~;"
01-04-2018T03:39:11,Dadrobit,"I technically coud have saved him, but I think it wouldn't have been the right choice."
01-04-2018T03:39:15,Dadrobit,could*
01-04-2018T03:39:17,Bgrmystr2,wow
01-04-2018T03:39:19,unsteddyphoenix,"Arent the elves like, way too powerful."
01-04-2018T03:39:20,Bgrmystr2,you're terrible &gt;:C
01-04-2018T03:39:42,Bgrmystr2,what would have happened if you saved him?
01-04-2018T03:39:53,Dadrobit,This is centuries prior to the Thalmor dominance in the elven lands.
01-04-2018T03:40:40,unsteddyphoenix,Oooh.
01-04-2018T03:40:52,Dadrobit,"The opportunity to destroy the relic would have been lost forever I would assume. The temple we were in was the only place it could have been destroyed, and it was being demolished."
01-04-2018T03:41:10,Dadrobit,I actually feel really terrible about it.
01-04-2018T03:41:16,Bgrmystr2,can't do both?
01-04-2018T03:41:25,Bgrmystr2,"save him, destroy the relic"
01-04-2018T03:41:32,Bgrmystr2,everyone lives happily ever after
01-04-2018T03:41:46,Bgrmystr2,"temple is destroyed, no evidence remains."
01-04-2018T03:41:48,Dadrobit,You get one last chance to talk with him before you commit to it and you get to reminice about all the adventures you'd taken on together.
01-04-2018T03:42:24,Dadrobit,Like the time that you helped him crossdess as the Queen to draw out an assassin.
01-04-2018T03:42:27,unsteddyphoenix,Aww...
01-04-2018T03:42:29,Dadrobit,Good times...
01-04-2018T03:42:37,Bgrmystr2,haha
01-04-2018T03:42:39,Bgrmystr2,sounds like it
01-04-2018T03:42:52,unsteddyphoenix,What why not let the player crossdress
01-04-2018T03:42:55,Bgrmystr2,"I'd be online lookin up a way to do both, myself."
01-04-2018T03:42:56,Dadrobit,RIP Razum-Dar. You were the best Khajiit.
01-04-2018T03:43:18,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-sad: o7

01-04-2018T03:43:29,unsteddyphoenix,Self-sacrificing khajiit now ive heard it all.
01-04-2018T03:43:42,Dadrobit,Because he was the Queens closest guard/spy/friend. He was the only one she trusted to do it.
01-04-2018T03:43:45,Bgrmystr2,Never get to pet him again..
01-04-2018T03:43:49,Bgrmystr2,:(

01-04-2018T03:44:38,Bgrmystr2,I would do that all day
01-04-2018T03:44:50,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, least till I could find one that'd let me pet them for free"
01-04-2018T03:44:51,Bgrmystr2,:U
01-04-2018T03:44:52,unsteddyphoenix,It's 2018 and I want to crossdress to infiltrate high society.
01-04-2018T03:44:59,Dadrobit,I don't think you'd keep all your fingers tho
01-04-2018T03:45:01,unsteddyphoenix,We need to put pressure on modern developers
01-04-2018T03:45:20,Bgrmystr2,"they don't like ppl petting them, Dadro :o"
01-04-2018T03:45:23,Bgrmystr2,?
01-04-2018T03:46:00,unsteddyphoenix,My adventures through the racist lands of skyrim has taught me that they'll do anything for coin so.

01-04-2018T03:46:17,unsteddyphoenix,Im sure the nords opinions are unbiased and factual
01-04-2018T03:47:16,Dadrobit,He never did tell me the full story of the time the Queen ordered him to ride a guar naked through an Argonian temple...
01-04-2018T03:47:50,Bgrmystr2,I wonder if there's any point in the game where he will
01-04-2018T03:47:54,unsteddyphoenix,Have the khajit always been this awesome? :thinking:
01-04-2018T03:47:55,Bgrmystr2,if you decide to save him
01-04-2018T03:48:20,unsteddyphoenix,Hopefully they wont be so ugly in the next game
01-04-2018T03:48:28,unsteddyphoenix,"I mean, the next skyrim release"
01-04-2018T03:49:01,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/JejS0sS.png
01-04-2018T03:49:24,unsteddyphoenix,What a FANCY MAN
01-04-2018T03:49:56,Dadrobit,"And yeah, the asthetic of pretty much everyone and everything in ESO is way better than Skyrim."
01-04-2018T03:50:42,unsteddyphoenix,Good thats good
01-04-2018T03:51:28,unsteddyphoenix,"Will they release a game after skyrim, you think?"
01-04-2018T03:51:31,unsteddyphoenix,Its been ages
01-04-2018T03:52:26,Dadrobit,It's utterly inevitable
01-04-2018T03:52:45,Dadrobit,Rumor is that a new big game is being announced next E3
01-04-2018T03:52:57,Bgrmystr2,10/10 classy as fuck
01-04-2018T03:52:59,Dadrobit,Since Bethesda bought up an entire slot
01-04-2018T03:52:59,unsteddyphoenix,hoo~
01-04-2018T03:53:04,Bgrmystr2,would give him top hat and monocle
01-04-2018T03:53:33,Dadrobit,And they already released all the new dlc/expansions for their existing IPs just beforehand
01-04-2018T03:53:46,Dadrobit,So the only thing they'll have to talk about is something new
01-04-2018T03:54:08,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, surely theyve milked skyrim for all it's worth"
01-04-2018T03:54:43,Dadrobit,"inb4 ""Coming to Android and iOS!"""
01-04-2018T03:55:19,unsteddyphoenix,If they can put PUBG on mobile then it's definitely possible
01-04-2018T03:59:31,Twokinds,They've gone on record saying their next game will be something not elder scrolls or fallout
01-04-2018T04:00:02,Dadrobit,"Yeah, unfortunately so."
01-04-2018T04:00:06,unsteddyphoenix,unfathomable.
01-04-2018T04:00:24,Twokinds,Wonder what they have planned.
01-04-2018T04:00:35,Dadrobit,"Though they hired an ass-ton of people recently, lotsa potential for multiple projects?"
01-04-2018T04:00:38,unsteddyphoenix,So the E3 thing will probably be something new?
01-04-2018T04:00:42,Dadrobit,"Like, 300 people."
01-04-2018T04:01:21,unsteddyphoenix,oh damn
01-04-2018T04:01:29,Twokinds,It's... a card game!
01-04-2018T04:01:44,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha
01-04-2018T04:01:53,Dadrobit,Already did that tho
01-04-2018T04:01:57,unsteddyphoenix,I saw that clip
01-04-2018T04:02:04,Dadrobit,They just released new content for it.
01-04-2018T04:02:08,Twokinds,It's... Battle Royale!
01-04-2018T04:02:20,unsteddyphoenix,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR4jPtrDCLo
01-04-2018T04:02:20,Dadrobit,....
01-04-2018T04:02:31,Dadrobit,Don't give ESO any ideas Tom.
01-04-2018T04:02:36,Twokinds,Something something popular trends
01-04-2018T04:02:36,unsteddyphoenix,Dude what if it was battle royale
01-04-2018T04:02:37,Dadrobit,I can see that happening
01-04-2018T04:02:43,unsteddyphoenix,I could absolutely see that
01-04-2018T04:03:00,unsteddyphoenix,"They must want to get away from sandbox stuff, surely."
01-04-2018T04:03:07,Dadrobit,"Holy shit, that collective moan"
01-04-2018T04:03:08,Twokinds,Maybe.
01-04-2018T04:03:13,Twokinds,"Yeah, lol!"
01-04-2018T04:03:32,Twokinds,"Man, Bethesda, doing a linear game? That just feels wrong."
01-04-2018T04:03:54,unsteddyphoenix,Is there any sense in making a new IP then doing what youve always done though?
01-04-2018T04:04:07,unsteddyphoenix,I guess they COULD but
01-04-2018T04:04:07,Dadrobit,Doom 2016 was a linear game
01-04-2018T04:04:11,Dadrobit,It kicked ass
01-04-2018T04:05:11,unsteddyphoenix,I barely heard anything about that after launch
01-04-2018T04:05:29,Dadrobit,"And I didn't play it, but Prey was linear I believe, and it got decent reviews as well."
01-04-2018T04:05:36,Dadrobit,Doom is actually amazing.
01-04-2018T04:05:59,Dadrobit,"Oh, and the Wolfensteins"
01-04-2018T04:06:09,Dadrobit,And Dishonored
01-04-2018T04:06:16,Twokinds,Well those aren't made by Bethesda
01-04-2018T04:06:16,unsteddyphoenix,"I heard great stuff about wolfenstein 2, been meaning to play it"
01-04-2018T04:06:18,Twokinds,I mean they are
01-04-2018T04:06:26,Dadrobit,lol
01-04-2018T04:06:29,Twokinds,But they're not made by the people who make Elder Scrolls and Fallout
01-04-2018T04:06:34,Twokinds,Those are seperate studios
01-04-2018T04:06:48,unsteddyphoenix,Arkane studios
01-04-2018T04:07:05,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah
01-04-2018T04:08:06,unsteddyphoenix,"Hm, I guess if they can delegate those types of games then maybe it WOULD be another sandbox"
01-04-2018T04:08:13,Twokinds,Prey's a great game though.
01-04-2018T04:09:07,Twokinds,Not entirely linear. The station itself you unlock as you go and then can freely move around it.
01-04-2018T04:09:19,unsteddyphoenix,I think...I started playing it but got distracted by DOS2
01-04-2018T04:10:42,unsteddyphoenix,I loved how the monster-things were disguised as mundane objects
01-04-2018T04:12:29,unsteddyphoenix,Ive really lost the abilirty to play multiple story-driven games :/
01-04-2018T04:12:32,unsteddyphoenix,at a time
01-04-2018T04:14:46,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
01-04-2018T04:15:11,Dadrobit,Heading to bed?
01-04-2018T04:15:24,Twokinds,Yep sleeptime
01-04-2018T04:15:35,unsteddyphoenix,pop the blanket on
01-04-2018T04:15:42,Dadrobit,"Alrighty then, have a good one."
01-04-2018T04:15:43,unsteddyphoenix,gnight
01-04-2018T04:15:48,Twokinds,night!
01-04-2018T04:19:03,iliar,"Good night, Tom!"
01-04-2018T04:19:26,Bgrmystr2,gnight tom
01-04-2018T11:33:25,TorqueEmUp,Again I want to apologize to you Tom. My behavior last night was completely out of line.
01-04-2018T11:40:42,TorqueEmUp,I feel absolutely disgusted with myself.
01-04-2018T12:01:40,BluePhantom90,Hey All. Hey Tom
01-04-2018T12:32:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Aw. Prey was talked about and I missed it
01-04-2018T14:35:40,TorqueEmUp,Still need to pick that up sometime an play it.
01-04-2018T14:36:08,TorqueEmUp,Still need to do that with the original Xbox 360 Prey as well
01-04-2018T14:36:21,TorqueEmUp,New one looks far more interesting though.
01-04-2018T15:33:24,TheFDdriver,hello
01-04-2018T15:33:29,BluePhantom90,hey
01-04-2018T15:33:42,TheFDdriver,stream?
01-04-2018T15:33:59,BadFoMo,Maybe.
01-04-2018T15:34:16,BluePhantom90,well -shrugs- Tom will post it on Patreon maybe. BUT yeah maybe
01-04-2018T15:34:53,TheFDdriver,he said exactly 4:37
01-04-2018T15:35:20,BadFoMo,2 more minutes.
01-04-2018T15:35:22,Mippy,*lurking on the chance that Tom decides to stream today*
01-04-2018T15:36:04,Mippy,*I've got noting else to do anyway haha*
01-04-2018T15:36:20,TheFDdriver,im exhausted
01-04-2018T15:37:24,TheFDdriver,4:37
01-04-2018T15:40:15,BluePhantom90,yeah never bet it will be at 4:37 on time. I mean Maybe 5pm
01-04-2018T15:40:47,TheFDdriver,I guess you're right
01-04-2018T15:58:53,Bgrmystr2,that was probably tom trolling :P
01-04-2018T15:59:21,Bgrmystr2,don't take any too exact statements seriously
01-04-2018T15:59:30,Bgrmystr2,there's no way to know what happens
01-04-2018T16:05:20,TheFDdriver,but its worth trying
01-04-2018T16:12:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom’s habitual sarcasm makes me automatically suspicious of everything he says
01-04-2018T16:13:28,ThingsAreMoving,"Is it sarcasm, or is it just irony"
01-04-2018T16:13:42,TheFDdriver,both
01-04-2018T16:13:43,ThingsAreMoving,"caught in bamboozlement, no escape from reality"
01-04-2018T16:20:01,WIPKING,On the bus.thougt i was missing stream lol
01-04-2018T16:20:21,WIPKING,Brb
01-04-2018T16:20:24,Bgrmystr2,xD Things I see where you went there
01-04-2018T16:21:03,ThingsAreMoving,finally

01-04-2018T16:23:33,Bgrmystr2,well played :tophat:
01-04-2018T16:23:48,ThingsAreMoving,"thank you, sir :tophat:"
01-04-2018T16:25:15,ThingsAreMoving,"I missed the late stream, did Tom say he's gonna stream tonight, or is it just wishful thinking?"
01-04-2018T16:25:43,BluePhantom90,"well he said he will do a Nora card, but sketch stream -shrugs- up in the air"
01-04-2018T16:25:59,Combak,"Also, he went to bed at 5:15, so..."
01-04-2018T16:27:59,Bgrmystr2,he said he needed to do nora cards
01-04-2018T16:28:05,Bgrmystr2,that's fairly normal though Combak
01-04-2018T16:28:37,ThingsAreMoving,"Alright, gonna keep tab open just in case and do some other stuff"
01-04-2018T16:38:25,WIPKING,Last night he said he might try and stream around 4:47 but im geussing its going to be much later
01-04-2018T16:39:22,Mippy,This has been the best stream ever
01-04-2018T16:47:33,WIPKING,?
01-04-2018T16:51:59,WIPKING,There isnt a recording of a stream
01-04-2018T16:52:19,WIPKING,Ohhh sarcasim
01-04-2018T17:04:36,CrimsonHelsing,Most likely
01-04-2018T17:14:37,CrimsonHelsing,*pause for effect* Bring it on.
01-04-2018T17:43:04,Combak,"Well, I see a Twokinds in the user list..."

01-04-2018T17:49:47,unsteddyphoenix,its the best
01-04-2018T17:50:08,ThingsAreMoving,Better yet when there's a snowstorm outside
01-04-2018T17:50:29,Bgrmystr2,fireplaces during the winter are the fucking best
01-04-2018T17:50:49,unsteddyphoenix,We dont get snow but that does sound amazing
01-04-2018T17:51:14,Twokinds,I like rain a lot.
01-04-2018T17:51:21,ThingsAreMoving,+1
01-04-2018T17:51:25,unsteddyphoenix,Me too
01-04-2018T17:51:48,Twokinds,Especially day showers.
01-04-2018T17:51:53,Mippy,I'd take rain over blisters anyday
01-04-2018T17:52:02,Twokinds,"Not too cold, overcast but still a little bright"
01-04-2018T17:52:04,ThingsAreMoving,"warm, heavy, summer rains"
01-04-2018T17:52:21,unsteddyphoenix,I like it best at night when im in bed
01-04-2018T17:52:26,unsteddyphoenix,So cozy~
01-04-2018T17:52:39,unsteddyphoenix,Delay sleep so I can enjoy it more
01-04-2018T17:53:10,Mippy,If it could be sprin or fall all year around... I'd be happy
01-04-2018T17:53:19,Mippy,*spring
01-04-2018T17:53:44,ThingsAreMoving,I have an ipod docked in my hifi and there's hours of thunderstorms recordings that I always leave on when I'm going to sleep
01-04-2018T17:54:04,ThingsAreMoving,neighbours thought i was weird at first but they got used to it
01-04-2018T17:54:24,Mippy,Nice to know I'm not the only one who enjoys storm sounds. It's comforting
01-04-2018T17:54:41,unsteddyphoenix,There's a website that just constantly streams rain/storm recordings
01-04-2018T17:55:06,ThingsAreMoving,I highly reccoment it for people who have trouble falling asleep
01-04-2018T17:55:19,ThingsAreMoving,reccomend*
01-04-2018T17:55:36,ThingsAreMoving,rain is just an awesome white noise

01-04-2018T17:57:26,Bgrmystr2,a lot of things don't like direct payment from paypal savings
01-04-2018T17:57:30,ThingsAreMoving,mine is working just fine
01-04-2018T17:57:32,TheBeckoner,All the sudden I'm back to being a patron again...
01-04-2018T17:57:39,TheBeckoner,Site bug I guess?
01-04-2018T17:57:56,Bgrmystr2,most sites I see don't actually accept direct payment from paypal
01-04-2018T17:58:07,TheBeckoner,Well it did before
01-04-2018T17:58:14,TheBeckoner,and now its back to normal

01-04-2018T19:01:44,WIPKING,Does stream start ina hour
01-04-2018T19:07:49,Bgrmystr2,"We don't know if there will be a stream today, and if there is, we'll find out whenever the stream starts."
01-04-2018T19:12:19,MidnightBlue78,hello~
01-04-2018T19:12:30,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-greetings:
01-04-2018T19:13:14,unsteddyphoenix,hihi
01-04-2018T19:17:09,MidnightBlue78,:ptv-greetings:
01-04-2018T19:20:22,BluePhantom90,So Tom is there a yay or nay on a stream?
01-04-2018T19:21:30,Bgrmystr2,betting he probably doesn't know yet
01-04-2018T19:49:21,Twokinds,Please stop asking if I'm going to stream.
01-04-2018T19:49:24,Twokinds,I'll stream if I stream.
01-04-2018T19:49:40,BluePhantom90,okay
01-04-2018T19:50:02,WIPKING,I stoped🤐
01-04-2018T19:51:18,WIPKING,So how does the voting system work
01-04-2018T19:51:57,WIPKING,Like when he finishes the 7 sketchs does he pick them or do we
01-04-2018T19:55:43,Bgrmystr2,"During the Sunday streams, the patrons suggest things, and tom selects a bunch of them and puts them on the voting site"
01-04-2018T19:55:59,Bgrmystr2,and anyone can load up the voting site and vote for which one they want
01-04-2018T19:56:48,Bgrmystr2,"it's usually about 7 sketches, and it also usually alternates between a vote and a tom pick"
01-04-2018T19:57:03,Bgrmystr2,"so sometimes there's 4 votes and 3 tom picks, sometimes the other way around"
01-04-2018T19:57:33,Bgrmystr2,"it just depends on how the stream goes, really"
01-04-2018T19:58:51,Bgrmystr2,"so the votes happen while the stream is going. Noone knows what will win, nor does anyone know what tom will pick"
01-04-2018T20:10:27,WIPKING,"Ok so a bit of both, ir really liked the one of natani anf keith under the umbrala, so i just wanted to vote it to be colored"
01-04-2018T20:10:57,Zakuru,hey folks
01-04-2018T20:11:12,WIPKING,Hi:ptv-greetings:
01-04-2018T20:11:23,Bgrmystr2,the color voting is for patrons only
01-04-2018T20:11:27,Bgrmystr2,and happens on the patreon
01-04-2018T20:11:45,InTheLionsDen,Most Sunday votes are for sketches. black & white. Only the last weekend of the month is voting on getting sketches colored.
01-04-2018T20:11:49,WIPKING,Well time too go spend some money
01-04-2018T20:15:12,WIPKING,So read the thing and what does no OC suggestions mean
01-04-2018T20:15:34,WIPKING,Sorry OC request
01-04-2018T20:15:44,InTheLionsDen,Original Characters. Ones people have created themselves.
01-04-2018T20:15:51,WIPKING,Ok
01-04-2018T20:16:48,WIPKING,So becuase it a new month should i start now to make a suggestion or should i wait untill next month for a new set of sketches
01-04-2018T20:19:16,WIPKING,So is the SQUIRRELY support where side comics come to your door
01-04-2018T20:19:25,WIPKING,Through mail
01-04-2018T20:19:30,Bgrmystr2,every single sunday people submit requests to be put in the vote. Tom compiles them before the sunday stream and chooses a bunch to be voted on during the stream
01-04-2018T20:19:38,Bgrmystr2,nothing comes to your mail
01-04-2018T20:20:49,WIPKING,So thats what squirrly support is
01-04-2018T20:21:04,WIPKING,I know what the second is
01-04-2018T20:21:58,WIPKING,"Mrs Nibbly will personally visit your home while you're away and rotate one random object 5°. Not enough to notice, but just enough that you subconsciously know something is out of place.   You also get side comics too.  is what it says so i do i get comi"
01-04-2018T20:22:08,WIPKING,S. In the mail
01-04-2018T20:22:20,InTheLionsDen,PDF downloads
01-04-2018T20:22:27,WIPKING,Ohh
01-04-2018T20:22:31,WIPKING,Well umm
01-04-2018T20:22:45,Bgrmystr2,"Squirrly support is just supporting tom. It doesn't let you suggest for the sketch stream, nor does it send anything to your mail. You can see the comics on the front page of his patreon"
01-04-2018T20:22:53,WIPKING,Someone already gives them out for free
01-04-2018T20:22:57,Bgrmystr2,"and if you're a patron, you can open them and read them"
01-04-2018T20:23:51,WIPKING,Ok
01-04-2018T20:24:06,Twokinds,One day soon they'll be more side comics posted at regular intervals on the Patreon
01-04-2018T20:24:21,WIPKING,So ill get the one for 10 bucks next month
01-04-2018T20:24:35,WIPKING,But someone already has pdf downloads
01-04-2018T20:24:58,WIPKING,http://www.robinvandevoorde.nl/twokinds/
01-04-2018T20:25:21,Dadrobit,Those aren't the side comics
01-04-2018T20:25:30,WIPKING,They include them
01-04-2018T20:25:39,WIPKING,It has everything
01-04-2018T20:25:40,Mippy,Sounds good Tom
01-04-2018T20:25:43,unsteddyphoenix,Why was that phrased so ominously.
01-04-2018T20:25:44,Dadrobit,Not the side comics
01-04-2018T20:25:51,unsteddyphoenix,One day soon...the side comics will come...
01-04-2018T20:25:56,WIPKING,Fine whatever
01-04-2018T20:25:56,unsteddyphoenix,Then you'll see...
01-04-2018T20:25:59,unsteddyphoenix,THEN YOULL ALL SEE
01-04-2018T20:26:05,unsteddyphoenix,The nice comics! :D
01-04-2018T20:26:06,Dadrobit,"""When the twin moons align..."""
01-04-2018T20:27:30,Dadrobit,"WIP, minikinds and april fools comics are not the ones that are included with the Patreon support. The Patreon support ones are entire extra stories."
01-04-2018T20:27:51,WIPKING,Never mind
01-04-2018T20:28:03,WIPKING,Its in the comics
01-04-2018T20:28:12,WIPKING,I have all of them downloaded
01-04-2018T20:29:16,Dadrobit,"So do I, and I'm telling you what's included in those downloads that you linked does not include the Patreon comics."
01-04-2018T20:29:38,Dadrobit,"That link's not some super secret thing, it's plastered right on the forums front page"
01-04-2018T20:29:44,Dadrobit,Has been for years.\
01-04-2018T20:30:07,WIPKING,Ok den
01-04-2018T20:31:35,Mippy,Actually...Bringing up the Patreon comics reminds me tat I have not read them yet. I should probubly do that. I probubly won't be so confused about Clovis if I do.
01-04-2018T20:34:04,WIPKING,I also might go basic on picarto.TV
01-04-2018T20:35:15,WIPKING,No one actually asked oops
01-04-2018T20:35:46,Bgrmystr2,"unless you're actually streaming, there's not really a point in paying for a premium account on picarto"
01-04-2018T20:35:55,WIPKING,Basic
01-04-2018T20:36:02,Bgrmystr2,which is a premium account.
01-04-2018T20:36:08,Combak,Hey all.
01-04-2018T20:36:09,WIPKING,Its 2.49 a month
01-04-2018T20:36:11,WIPKING,Hey
01-04-2018T20:36:17,Bgrmystr2,that's not really relevant.
01-04-2018T20:36:17,Dadrobit,o/ Combak
01-04-2018T20:36:21,Bgrmystr2,hey combak
01-04-2018T20:36:32,WIPKING,Bgr the is basic and premimum
01-04-2018T20:36:44,WIPKING,And i might do basic
01-04-2018T20:37:19,Bgrmystr2,basic is a lower tier of premium. You're still paying for it. And you will probably never use any of the benefits either one gives you
01-04-2018T20:37:24,Dadrobit,"Eh, if he wants to waste his money, let him."
01-04-2018T20:37:34,WIPKING,Still nobody asked me so
01-04-2018T20:37:59,WIPKING,Custom emojis
01-04-2018T20:38:22,Bgrmystr2,you only get your own emoji if you upgrade to basic
01-04-2018T20:38:25,Bgrmystr2,you don't get anyone elses.
01-04-2018T20:38:46,InTheLionsDen,If your goal is to access the TwoKinds emotes you need to subscribe to TwoKinds.
01-04-2018T20:38:56,WIPKING,I did
01-04-2018T20:39:00,WIPKING,Ohh wiat
01-04-2018T20:39:14,Bgrmystr2,"If you did, you'd have a $ sign next to your name, which you do not lol"
01-04-2018T20:39:56,WIPKING,What are the subscriber raffles
01-04-2018T20:40:37,Bgrmystr2,They let the streamer raffle off stuff to a random person that's subscribed. Tom doesn't really do that though.
01-04-2018T20:40:45,WIPKING,Ohh
01-04-2018T20:40:57,Combak,"Hey Robit, Bgr, WIPKING"

01-04-2018T20:41:06,Bgrmystr2,"I've seen some streamers raffle for fun, not really to give stuff away"

01-04-2018T22:17:48,Bgrmystr2,"""everything"" wouldn't really be out of place, would it? :thinking:"
01-04-2018T22:18:41,WIPKING,This is the part where i try to understand but cant cause im Young
01-04-2018T22:20:35,TorqueEmUp,Bunny shouldn't have been in the road. :P
01-04-2018T22:21:10,TorqueEmUp,I dunno how many times I've had squirrels that can't make up their mind in which direction they want to dart.
01-04-2018T22:21:20,TorqueEmUp,Never hit one though
01-04-2018T22:21:37,unsteddyphoenix,"We should cut off all their limbs for safety, eh torque?"
01-04-2018T22:21:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Haven’t hit anything so far either

01-04-2018T22:24:15,TorqueEmUp,"All I saw was a grey blob, and then a huge bang from the from suspension, so violent that it disengaged the cruise control."

01-04-2018T22:25:30,TorqueEmUp,"but I was going 70MPH in the middle of the night, I wouldn't have been able to avoid it. It happened so fast I didn't even see what it was."
01-04-2018T22:26:50,TorqueEmUp,"Felt really bad because I didn't know if what I hit was alive, or just something that someone blew onto the highway on a day when it wasn't windy."
01-04-2018T22:26:57,TorqueEmUp,night*
01-04-2018T22:27:13,Dadrobit,Back

01-04-2018T22:27:53,Bgrmystr2,"whatcha do now, Dadro"
01-04-2018T22:27:53,Dadrobit,Went to the store and totally forgot to get curry related foodstuffs.

01-04-2018T22:32:22,Dadrobit,Lol
01-04-2018T22:32:57,unsteddyphoenix,What's Bashas? Thats not walmart.
01-04-2018T22:33:11,Dadrobit,"Were they official Kellogs fruit loops, or off-brand?"
01-04-2018T22:33:45,Dadrobit,Bashas' is a pretty decent sized grocery store chain based out of AZ mostly.
01-04-2018T22:33:47,unsteddyphoenix,They had the toucan on the front so. legit? :thinking:
01-04-2018T22:34:15,Dadrobit,I've been going to this store since I was born.
01-04-2018T22:35:00,Dadrobit,"They're a tiny bit pricier than Wal-Mart, but they're closer and I like talking to all the employees."
01-04-2018T22:35:18,unsteddyphoenix,But then you wont get all those walmart stories
01-04-2018T22:35:33,unsteddyphoenix,"Which, as I understand, is the main appeal"
01-04-2018T22:35:34,Dadrobit,"Also, maybe? Copyright for off-brand cereal is more of a suggestion."
01-04-2018T22:36:27,Dadrobit,"Well, Josh, the cashier on tonight almost got into it with a dude in front of me paying for $50 worth of stuff in $1's."
01-04-2018T22:36:30,unsteddyphoenix,Theyre more like guidelines anyway~
01-04-2018T22:36:37,unsteddyphoenix,Ooof
01-04-2018T22:36:54,Dadrobit,"He took the money, but there were some sharp words exchanged."
01-04-2018T22:37:08,Dadrobit,With a smile of course
01-04-2018T22:37:39,Dadrobit,"""Oh! So you're going to be ""That guy""?"" *amiles*"
01-04-2018T22:37:45,Dadrobit,*smiles*
01-04-2018T22:38:02,Dadrobit,You tell em Josh!
01-04-2018T22:38:07,unsteddyphoenix,"""Have a 𝐖𝐎𝐍𝐃𝐄𝐑𝐅𝐔𝐋 day! """
01-04-2018T22:38:19,unsteddyphoenix,Tbh ive been that guy
01-04-2018T22:38:31,unsteddyphoenix,Paying with $1/2 coins. Pretty embarrassing
01-04-2018T22:38:55,unsteddyphoenix,"I did all the math beforehand, but still."
01-04-2018T22:39:22,Dadrobit,I refuse to be that guy. I spent too many years as a till operator that I feel terrible going through other people's till with anything except absolute efficiency.
01-04-2018T22:39:51,Dadrobit,people's tills*
01-04-2018T22:40:39,unsteddyphoenix,"I agree, it'd never happen now that I have plastic."
01-04-2018T22:40:47,unsteddyphoenix,but back in the day...
01-04-2018T22:41:28,unsteddyphoenix,"ive done the opposite too, bought an energy drink with a $100 bill 'cause that's what I was paid with."
01-04-2018T22:41:55,Dadrobit,"I did it once as a kid. Got a used PSP from GameStop, used all the money I'd saved up for a few years to pay for it. Nothing larger than a $20..."
01-04-2018T22:42:14,unsteddyphoenix,d'aw. I can picture that so clearly.
01-04-2018T22:42:41,unsteddyphoenix,Did you have braces?
01-04-2018T22:42:48,Dadrobit,"As a till operator, I didn't feel too terrible about taking large denominations and counting out bills. It just meant that sometimes the customer ended up with 19 $5's"
01-04-2018T22:43:16,Dadrobit,I think I had my braces off by then?
01-04-2018T22:43:20,Dadrobit,I tihn
01-04-2018T22:43:22,Dadrobit,think*
01-04-2018T22:43:29,unsteddyphoenix,Dang
01-04-2018T22:43:34,unsteddyphoenix,That seems like the same amount of annoying to me?
01-04-2018T22:44:00,Dadrobit,"Naw, counting out someone's change that they dumped on my counter was actually infuriating."
01-04-2018T22:44:09,Dadrobit,Can take several minutes
01-04-2018T22:44:17,Dadrobit,Counting cash takes seconds
01-04-2018T22:44:58,Dadrobit,Especially prominent in my mind as I was always the closer and was the only person in the store.
01-04-2018T22:46:14,Dadrobit,So now I have Douchebag McGee with a shit eating grin having me count out his quarters and dimes he dumped out of his mason jar on my desk while a dozen people all pile up behind him.
01-04-2018T22:46:31,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao.
01-04-2018T22:46:32,Dadrobit,Bonus points if it still isn't enough money
01-04-2018T22:46:47,unsteddyphoenix,Doesnt he know that mason jars are for drinking craft beer out of?
01-04-2018T22:46:48,Dadrobit,"""Try taking off an apple."""
01-04-2018T22:47:07,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh god, thats a whole other layer"
01-04-2018T22:47:26,Dadrobit,Actual nightmares.
01-04-2018T22:47:56,unsteddyphoenix,Nothing is more motivating then other peoples customer service stories
01-04-2018T22:48:25,unsteddyphoenix,Desperately want to avoid that
01-04-2018T22:48:51,Bgrmystr2,"I would never pay in coins unless I've actually counted it all first, and I've never paid in coins to anything but a bank, really, and I used those bank rolls for the coins too"
01-04-2018T22:49:00,Dadrobit,Got in trouble once for it because I outright refused to check a dude out.
01-04-2018T22:49:15,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, at the very least do the math in your head first."
01-04-2018T22:49:28,Dadrobit,Already had a line going when the guy pulled out his coin jar
01-04-2018T22:49:52,Dadrobit,"Told him to either use the Coin Star machine off to the side, or pay with plastic."
01-04-2018T22:50:00,unsteddyphoenix,Should put it to a vote for the line
01-04-2018T22:50:05,Dadrobit,"He refused both, so I refused him."
01-04-2018T22:50:23,unsteddyphoenix,"The majority of the customers are always right, as they say."
01-04-2018T22:50:26,Dadrobit,Only because it wasn't his first time.
01-04-2018T22:50:40,Dadrobit,"He was making it a habit, just to fuck with cashiers."
01-04-2018T22:50:43,unsteddyphoenix,Where does one man acquire so many coins...
01-04-2018T22:50:48,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh, really?"
01-04-2018T22:50:50,Dadrobit,Hell if I know.
01-04-2018T22:50:55,Twokinds,I don't know how people like that can stand inconveniencing other people like that
01-04-2018T22:51:03,Bgrmystr2,banks hold LOTS of coins
01-04-2018T22:51:07,Dadrobit,Still wrote up a nasty email to the store director.
01-04-2018T22:51:07,unsteddyphoenix,Was it seriously intentional?
01-04-2018T22:51:10,unsteddyphoenix,That's ridiculous
01-04-2018T22:51:14,Dadrobit,Oh absolutely.
01-04-2018T22:51:31,Twokinds,"Like, don't they feel the judgement of everyone around them?"
01-04-2018T22:51:44,Dadrobit,"""Excuse me Mr. Till Operator, but it clearly say ""Valid tender for all debts public and private!"""
01-04-2018T22:51:50,Dadrobit,says*
01-04-2018T22:52:11,Dadrobit,And I reminded him that I reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason.
01-04-2018T22:52:21,Dadrobit,Including being a douche
01-04-2018T22:52:27,unsteddyphoenix,"Honestly i'd be worried about like, being jumped in the parking lot"
01-04-2018T22:52:31,unsteddyphoenix,Especially if it's a habit
01-04-2018T22:52:59,Dadrobit,"He stopped after that, avoided my line too which was nice."
01-04-2018T22:53:11,Dadrobit,But I still got a talking to by the store director.
01-04-2018T22:53:22,unsteddyphoenix,He stopped showing up with coins but kept going to the same store?
01-04-2018T22:53:34,Dadrobit,shruggs
01-04-2018T22:53:52,unsteddyphoenix,That's insane to me
01-04-2018T22:53:59,Bgrmystr2,some stores have better prices than others
01-04-2018T22:54:02,Dadrobit,"Had a lady that would straight up yell how much she hated me, but still came back."
01-04-2018T22:54:25,Bgrmystr2,it's not like you ARE the store lol
01-04-2018T22:54:43,Dadrobit,"It was a convenience thing I think. We were surrounded by snowbird compounds, so they all went to us."
01-04-2018T22:55:10,unsteddyphoenix,Who are these people that are completely ok with making a scene in public
01-04-2018T22:55:33,Dadrobit,"I maintained a unrelenting air of positivity with all my customers, so she thought I was making fun of her."
01-04-2018T22:55:41,unsteddyphoenix,"If there are lizard people, it's them"
01-04-2018T22:55:44,Dadrobit,But I wasn't
01-04-2018T22:55:48,Dadrobit,At first.
01-04-2018T22:55:56,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
01-04-2018T22:56:19,Dadrobit,"""Ohhhhh, Mrs So and So!!!! So good to see you again!!!"""
01-04-2018T22:56:24,Dadrobit,"""Fuck off David"""
01-04-2018T22:56:27,Bgrmystr2,xD
01-04-2018T22:56:30,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh that's the best way
01-04-2018T22:56:42,Bgrmystr2,:ok_hand:
01-04-2018T22:56:44,Dadrobit,Kill them with kindness.
01-04-2018T22:56:51,unsteddyphoenix,But they still kept going to you. They knew your name! Mind-bogglign.
01-04-2018T22:56:58,Dadrobit,I had a name tag
01-04-2018T22:57:35,unsteddyphoenix,"But was it ""fuck off *reads nametag* david"""
01-04-2018T22:57:36,Dadrobit,"Also, earlier in the day there would be other tills open, but mine may have been the shortest line."
01-04-2018T22:57:51,Dadrobit,"Oh, no. She knew who I was."
01-04-2018T22:57:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"What’s worse, though: the people who give you nothing but change to pay their bill, the people who make a scene to get free stuff, or the people who scream at the person behind the counter because of a minor inconvenience?"
01-04-2018T22:57:59,Dadrobit,She was a regular snowbird.
01-04-2018T22:58:21,Dadrobit,The ones that combine all three.
01-04-2018T22:58:28,Dadrobit,"Yes, it happens."
01-04-2018T22:59:05,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake:
01-04-2018T22:59:27,Dadrobit,"I actually liked the ones that made a huge scene, because I generally have nerves of steel and can take it all with a smile."
01-04-2018T22:59:40,Dadrobit,Makes me look good in front of all the other customers.
01-04-2018T23:00:27,Dadrobit,"And don't get me wrong, a lot of people liked me. I turned that till into a show."
01-04-2018T23:00:40,unsteddyphoenix,Did you juggle?
01-04-2018T23:01:03,Dadrobit,"No, but I did sleight of hand sometimes."
01-04-2018T23:01:24,unsteddyphoenix,Were you proficient in it?
01-04-2018T23:01:25,Dadrobit,And I used to turn out of date coupons into games the customer couldn't lose.
01-04-2018T23:01:43,Dadrobit,Like flipping a coin that I could force into whatever they called.
01-04-2018T23:01:53,Dadrobit,Had a dedicated dollar coin for it.
01-04-2018T23:02:02,Bgrmystr2,sounds fun
01-04-2018T23:02:06,Dadrobit,Only got caught on the force once early on.
01-04-2018T23:02:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve seen grown men go postal on teen girls for the stupidest things
01-04-2018T23:02:59,unsteddyphoenix,"So like, if they won then their coupon was valid?"
01-04-2018T23:03:06,Dadrobit,"And the apron I used was big, bulky, and had a hole in the bottom of one of the pockets so I could make things disappear and reappear for them,"
01-04-2018T23:03:56,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I always played it up. ""Ya know, we're reaaaaaaly not supposed to take out of date coupons, but I'll tell you what! Call the coin toss and if you win, you got it."""
01-04-2018T23:04:12,unsteddyphoenix,That is
01-04-2018T23:04:14,unsteddyphoenix,So cute
01-04-2018T23:04:17,unsteddyphoenix,YOURE cute
01-04-2018T23:04:21,Dadrobit,"In reality, the store policy was, ""If they ask, just give it to them."""
01-04-2018T23:04:22,unsteddyphoenix,I love that
01-04-2018T23:04:59,unsteddyphoenix,I am tickled about this
01-04-2018T23:05:17,Dadrobit,"Store director didn't like it though, lol. It slowed me waaaay down on my checking speed."
01-04-2018T23:05:20,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I just keep out of date coupons and shit 'cause 90% of th etime they take 'em anyway
01-04-2018T23:05:27,unsteddyphoenix,Oh yeah
01-04-2018T23:05:38,unsteddyphoenix,If I was your supervisor i'd stop that right away
01-04-2018T23:05:42,Dadrobit,"So I averaged only around 15-16 items per minute, while everyone else was at 18-20."
01-04-2018T23:05:44,unsteddyphoenix,But im not so i love it
01-04-2018T23:06:24,Dadrobit,"The supervisors loved it, my customer satisfaction ratings were great, and I sold a metric shit ton of donations."
01-04-2018T23:06:35,Dadrobit,It was only the store director that didn't like me.
01-04-2018T23:06:41,unsteddyphoenix,Do cashiers get tipped?
01-04-2018T23:07:01,Dadrobit,"Unfortunately no, I turned down some good money there...."
01-04-2018T23:07:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"And as logical as your thought process is, Tom, some people are just not taught human decency"
01-04-2018T23:07:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Or respect
01-04-2018T23:07:39,Dadrobit,"And they stopped giving out prizes for the most donations sold because I always won, no contest."
01-04-2018T23:07:43,Dadrobit,Which kinda sucked.
01-04-2018T23:07:51,TheBeckoner,Makes for some decent entertainment tho Kiwi
01-04-2018T23:08:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Not when you’re the one being yelled at
01-04-2018T23:08:07,Dadrobit,So it was pretty much just minimum wage.
01-04-2018T23:08:42,Bgrmystr2,aw rip
01-04-2018T23:08:45,Bgrmystr2,good guy dadro
01-04-2018T23:08:50,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
01-04-2018T23:08:51,Dadrobit,"My glass ceiling was only like 11.50, and I was something like 9.85 at the time I got fired. GG."
01-04-2018T23:08:55,unsteddyphoenix,That's pretty funny
01-04-2018T23:09:59,TheBeckoner,I suppose it depends on what sorta person you are. I dont mind gettin yelled at if the person in front of me ends up lookin like a dick lol
01-04-2018T23:10:12,Dadrobit,That's exactly it.
01-04-2018T23:11:07,Dadrobit,"99.999% of the time people are upset with me, it's because of something that's completely and utterly out of my hands, so I'm not gonna bother getting upset about it."
01-04-2018T23:11:23,TheBeckoner,Yup. Pretty much my take on it
01-04-2018T23:11:45,Bgrmystr2,the couple I live with just made some fritters :v
01-04-2018T23:11:59,Bgrmystr2,powdered sugar all over that
01-04-2018T23:12:03,Bgrmystr2,somethin good &lt;3
01-04-2018T23:12:21,Dadrobit,What's the base? Apple?
01-04-2018T23:12:31,Bgrmystr2,plain fritters
01-04-2018T23:12:39,Bgrmystr2,originally it was going to be banana fritters
01-04-2018T23:12:52,Bgrmystr2,but she liked the normal fritter taste so much that she made the rest of em plain xD
01-04-2018T23:12:59,Dadrobit,"Whoa, banana fritters sounds amazeballs."
01-04-2018T23:13:43,Bgrmystr2,"yeh. I'm not super big on bananas myself, but I always did like fried dough"
01-04-2018T23:14:13,Dadrobit,I'm allergic to them. So it's kind of an abusive relationship...
01-04-2018T23:14:20,Bgrmystr2,aww
01-04-2018T23:14:22,Bgrmystr2,really? :(
01-04-2018T23:14:26,Bgrmystr2,that super sucks
01-04-2018T23:14:37,Bgrmystr2,I'd trade you in a heartbeat. I don't really even eat banana
01-04-2018T23:14:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m technically not supposed to eat bacon
01-04-2018T23:15:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Can make me sick
01-04-2018T23:15:13,Bgrmystr2,it's bacon tho
01-04-2018T23:15:32,Bgrmystr2,that applies to basically everybody
01-04-2018T23:15:32,Dadrobit,"Yeah, used to eat them all the time as a kid. Just assumed the throat fuckery was just part and parcel for the banana experience."
01-04-2018T23:15:52,Bgrmystr2,lool noo dadro
01-04-2018T23:16:01,Bgrmystr2,guessing you're not severely allergic then
01-04-2018T23:16:08,Bgrmystr2,since that shit would have possibly killed you
01-04-2018T23:16:27,Dadrobit,"Naw, just makes my throat scratchy and constrict a little."
01-04-2018T23:16:35,Dadrobit,But I did have to stop
01-04-2018T23:16:43,Bgrmystr2,understandable
01-04-2018T23:16:46,Dadrobit,That shit gets worse the older you get.
01-04-2018T23:16:52,Bgrmystr2,ah does it
01-04-2018T23:17:14,Dadrobit,"Yeah, sis has a peanut allergy"
01-04-2018T23:17:22,Dadrobit,Used to just make her sick
01-04-2018T23:17:29,Dadrobit,Now it's a hospital visit
01-04-2018T23:18:17,Bgrmystr2,not cool.. peanuts are awesome :(
01-04-2018T23:18:25,Dadrobit,"Yeah, so are bananas."
01-04-2018T23:18:44,SpazztasticKiwi,More of a walnut person
01-04-2018T23:19:09,Bgrmystr2,"nuts in general I guess, Kiwi"
01-04-2018T23:19:11,TheBeckoner,I like cashews myself.
01-04-2018T23:19:15,Bgrmystr2,yeah same Beck
01-04-2018T23:19:23,TheBeckoner,Nice texture
01-04-2018T23:19:36,Bgrmystr2,"cashews are my favorite, followed by pecans"
01-04-2018T23:19:42,TheBeckoner,sorta soft...best part imo
01-04-2018T23:19:44,Bgrmystr2,though they're super close
01-04-2018T23:20:04,TheBeckoner,Pecans are good too. Mainly in pie form
01-04-2018T23:21:38,Bgrmystr2,yeh Pecan Pie is amazing
01-04-2018T23:21:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Pie
01-04-2018T23:22:21,SpazztasticKiwi,More of an apple pie person really
01-04-2018T23:22:47,Bgrmystr2,polite pass on that one
01-04-2018T23:22:56,TheBeckoner,same
01-04-2018T23:23:04,Dadrobit,:O
01-04-2018T23:23:08,TheBeckoner,Texture freaks me out on wet apples

01-04-2018T23:28:56,WIPKING,It would be cool if tom did a steam punk art
01-04-2018T23:29:00,Bgrmystr2,technically.. my face is made of all the ppl's lives I've made miserable.
01-04-2018T23:29:22,TheBeckoner,How does that look on a scale of 1-10?
01-04-2018T23:29:25,TheBeckoner,or 1-7

01-04-2018T23:31:46,WIPKING,Still think it would be cool of tom did natani or kat in a lether suit with cogs and docks in the background with flying boats
01-04-2018T23:32:01,Bgrmystr2,then you should suggest it
01-04-2018T23:32:11,WIPKING,Next month

01-04-2018T23:38:50,Dadrobit,"It's from Patreon, says that there are 254 people currently in the $10 tier"
01-04-2018T23:39:06,Bgrmystr2,"ah, yeah not everyone is going to submit a request"
01-04-2018T23:39:16,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it's just potentially that many"
01-04-2018T23:39:24,WIPKING,MAKE A SKETCH REQUEST(chosen by 254 patrons) $10.00+ per month  Make suggestions for sketches each week. Vote each month on which ones get inked and colored. Watch their progress during patreon sketch streams. Sketches and finished art will be made availa
01-04-2018T23:39:24,Bgrmystr2,and it also includes anyone in a higher tier than that as well

01-04-2018T23:39:58,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, 254 people are paying for that tier, but not all of them will be suggesting things"
01-04-2018T23:40:18,Dadrobit,"Only 228 people actually got sent the opportunity to submit last time,"
01-04-2018T23:40:23,Bgrmystr2,not everyone cares.
01-04-2018T23:40:25,WIPKING,Ok but still im pretty sure no one wants a stea punk art
