09-08-2018T01:33:00,SpazztasticKiwi,It was the frog
09-08-2018T01:35:22,Dadrobit,"Just as an aside. ""Piddling"" can be interpreted as ""peeing."" I get what you were saying, but just for future reference lol."
09-08-2018T01:36:09,SpazztasticKiwi,That kind of reference is normally more uk oriented too
09-08-2018T01:46:03,Dadrobit,"Hm, just heard it a lot in reference to pets and small children."
09-08-2018T02:31:41,Twokinds,"I don't know why the transcript isn't updating. I did add the correction this morning, but it just doesn't want to take."
09-08-2018T02:41:24,Dadrobit,:/ How odd
09-08-2018T02:42:17,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like change. The internet is forever and so is your mistake. Try again later‚Äù
09-08-2018T02:56:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"And other than it not being 100% clear when the next person is talking or if they‚Äôve changed languages, it‚Äôs relatively clear"
09-08-2018T03:00:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Ever get those sketches done and jump into some free time? Or you find yourself some other busy work?
09-08-2018T03:33:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Oop nm ‚Äòtis bedtime üõå
09-08-2018T12:38:43,TorqueEmUp,"Oof, maybe iliar's script is no good?"
09-08-2018T12:46:52,Mippy,Anyone else‚Äôs world yellow today? Everything smells like a wood stove. Surrounded on all sides by fire. On the bright side...I finally know who Fidget is.
09-08-2018T12:55:43,TheGamePlayer,Hi
09-08-2018T12:55:44,TorqueEmUp,Well people did say she was from Dust. :P
09-08-2018T12:55:58,TorqueEmUp,"Good game btw, definitely recommend."
09-08-2018T12:56:57,TheGamePlayer,"We just tore down part of one of our cabins, it was fun!!!"
09-08-2018T12:58:07,TheGamePlayer,Going to build a new one
09-08-2018T13:03:32,TheGamePlayer,.
09-08-2018T13:26:33,iliar,@TorqueEmUp I use a script to check the transcript for errors.
09-08-2018T13:55:32,TorqueEmUp,I was just suggesting it as a possibility.
09-08-2018T13:55:40,TorqueEmUp,I wasn't saying you didn't know your stuff.
09-08-2018T14:01:02,PhilTheIdle,How long till the stream starts?
09-08-2018T14:32:46,SpazztasticKiwi,So you‚Äôre saying it didn‚Äôt go by the script?
09-08-2018T14:34:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Or you type in what it‚Äôs supposed to read *going by* what said script says?
09-08-2018T15:03:49,Twokinds,I can't for the life of me figure out why the transcript isn't updating
09-08-2018T15:04:00,Twokinds,It's just stuck
09-08-2018T15:28:02,SpazztasticKiwi,It don‚Äôt wanna
09-08-2018T15:30:10,SpazztasticKiwi,But at least it doesn‚Äôt have any blatant typos or big issues. It‚Äôll be ok for a lil bit
09-08-2018T15:32:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Welp I‚Äôm off to the wonderful cycle of closing. Be back when my sentence is done :ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
09-08-2018T17:03:47,Mippy,Started playing Dust the other night. I‚Äôm liking what I‚Äôve seen of it. I think my commitment to game more is going to go well.
09-08-2018T17:04:35,Bgrmystr2,Can't figure out how to authorize a program to work with picarto
09-08-2018T17:05:03,Bgrmystr2,"the notifier won't generate it's own authorization code, and picarto doesn't have an option in the settings to give addons a code to work with it."
09-08-2018T17:05:06,tehbear,timing the attack against titans can be a bit tricky.
09-08-2018T17:05:46,tehbear,i just started playing dust again this evening. played it 2 years ago to 20% completion
09-08-2018T17:58:44,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs a hell of a cool down period

09-08-2018T19:54:24,HobbitGames,What would that be in celsius? We never use Farenheit.
09-08-2018T19:54:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,32
09-08-2018T19:54:41,HobbitGames,Like 20 something degrees celsius?

09-08-2018T19:57:07,Bgrmystr2,"Hobbit, 20C is high 60s"
09-08-2018T19:57:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Oh god I wish is was 60's
09-08-2018T19:57:25,Matth3w23,"Hi foxx, and sorry to hear that hobbit."
09-08-2018T19:58:10,HobbitGames,Thanks. I dont understand why 32 farenheit is 0 celsius. How is such a system devised?
09-08-2018T19:58:27,FoxxTrotter,Magic.
09-08-2018T19:58:35,HobbitGames,That explains it
09-08-2018T19:58:42,Matth3w23,Which system? Celsius or Fahrenheit?
09-08-2018T19:58:47,Bgrmystr2,"It's not magic, but there is an answer lol"
09-08-2018T19:58:48,HobbitGames,Farenheit
09-08-2018T19:58:58,Matth3w23,Isn't that done off body temp?
09-08-2018T19:59:08,Matth3w23,I may be completely wrong
09-08-2018T19:59:12,HobbitGames,Body temp is 36.something
09-08-2018T19:59:30,Bgrmystr2,or 98.6F
09-08-2018T19:59:37,FoxxTrotter,Fahrenheit to Celsius &gt;&gt; Subtract 32 and divide by 1.8.
09-08-2018T19:59:48,Bgrmystr2,"noone's gonna remember that, Foxx xD"
09-08-2018T19:59:51,Matth3w23,Good thing I learnt my 1.8 times table
09-08-2018T19:59:57,HobbitGames,"Im not sure if that is celsius or farenheit,it would seem to be farenhit but we learn it is school here"
09-08-2018T19:59:58,FoxxTrotter,Celsius to Kelvin &gt;&gt; Add 273.
09-08-2018T20:00:11,Matth3w23,Insert 0K joke here

09-08-2018T21:08:50,MetalAppleSauce,and halo wars 2 is absolute trash
09-08-2018T21:08:53,Bgrmystr2,"hell, played through the whole thing a couple weekends back at mechacon, still love it"
09-08-2018T21:08:58,Bgrmystr2,"both were, Metal"
09-08-2018T21:09:00,Bgrmystr2,:/
09-08-2018T21:09:06,totallynotTrace,they made a HW 2?
09-08-2018T21:09:08,Bgrmystr2,give me a real RTS pls
09-08-2018T21:09:08,MetalAppleSauce,HW1 was at least DECENT
09-08-2018T21:09:13,ShammyTV,Halo 3 had the best Custom Games
09-08-2018T21:09:16,ItsActuallyKopyKat,hw1 was eh
09-08-2018T21:09:20,ItsActuallyKopyKat,4/10
09-08-2018T21:09:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"character customization is reach, I remember looking great... had fun with that"
09-08-2018T21:09:33,superwolfart,hi all
09-08-2018T21:09:36,ShammyTV,Hello
09-08-2018T21:09:37,CrRAR,yeh
09-08-2018T21:09:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Wolf
09-08-2018T21:09:40,CrRAR,hello!
09-08-2018T21:09:45,ItsActuallyKopyKat,wolfart! howdy
09-08-2018T21:09:45,ShammyTV,I didn't like the credits system in Reach though
09-08-2018T21:09:49,FoxxTrotter,"Hey, Superwolf."
09-08-2018T21:09:57,ShammyTV,I preferred 3 where you unlocked armor by doing specific things
09-08-2018T21:10:00,totallynotTrace,the funniest part was I only got to play the first mission at a friends house but thats all it took for me to discover the genre
09-08-2018T21:10:05,MetalAppleSauce,"Reach has the same if not better capabilities than 3, people just didn't remake them"
09-08-2018T21:10:09,Bgrmystr2,still bugs me that they shut down a Halo mod for C&C Generals just to force ppl into buying the console for halo wars
09-08-2018T21:10:16,MetalAppleSauce,"for custom games, I mean"
09-08-2018T21:10:19,ShammyTV,Reach was missing modes from 3
09-08-2018T21:10:26,Bgrmystr2,was such a selfish bs decision
09-08-2018T21:10:27,ShammyTV,And Sandbox was a better canvas than FW IMO
09-08-2018T21:10:35,MetalAppleSauce,^
09-08-2018T21:10:44,ShammyTV,You could be way more creative with Sandbox
09-08-2018T21:10:46,CrRAR,"crap, gotta untie my bike from my car rack."
09-08-2018T21:10:46,MetalAppleSauce,It was just a pain to remove all the objects over and over
09-08-2018T21:10:46,CrRAR,is' gon rain
09-08-2018T21:10:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I loved just driving around in forge world, just vroom vroom"
09-08-2018T21:10:59,ShammyTV,Just save a canvas version lol
09-08-2018T21:11:02,MetalAppleSauce,same for Foundry
09-08-2018T21:11:05,Bgrmystr2,@Cr thanks ollie
09-08-2018T21:11:07,ZahnHolley,Hi!
09-08-2018T21:11:11,ShammyTV,Again save a canvas haha
09-08-2018T21:11:15,ShammyTV,I made a ton of maps in 3/Reach
09-08-2018T21:11:22,ShammyTV,One of my Reach maps was super popular as well
09-08-2018T21:11:31,ShammyTV,But 3 had better custom games IMO
09-08-2018T21:11:32,Bgrmystr2,I still wait for the reverse oddball gametype
09-08-2018T21:11:42,ShammyTV,3's physics made for more fun gametypes
09-08-2018T21:11:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,floaty jumping
09-08-2018T21:12:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,love it so much :)
09-08-2018T21:12:11,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"ok guys and gals, I've gotta go. See you folks later!"
09-08-2018T21:12:11,ShammyTV,Yeah but not just the jumping
09-08-2018T21:12:13,MetalAppleSauce,I have vague memories of being able to walk on walls in one of the action sacks
09-08-2018T21:12:18,MetalAppleSauce,in 3
09-08-2018T21:12:19,DarthKeidran,"I love how it‚Äôs turning out, but I‚Äôve got to go."
09-08-2018T21:12:25,ShammyTV,That was a map built on a 45 degree angle
09-08-2018T21:12:32,Afallingtree,Cya Kopy
09-08-2018T21:12:38,HobbitGames,Cya darth
09-08-2018T21:12:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,See ya Kopy
09-08-2018T21:12:44,ZahnHolley,"Its been awhile,"
09-08-2018T21:12:45,ShammyTV,But Halo 3's vehicle physics are where it's at
09-08-2018T21:12:46,Combak,I love that map Shammy.
09-08-2018T21:12:54,ShammyTV,The 45 degree angle one?
09-08-2018T21:12:58,MetalAppleSauce,no I mean legit being able to just turn 90 degrees upward and walk on the walls
09-08-2018T21:12:59,Combak,Yeah!
09-08-2018T21:13:04,ShammyTV,Yeah that map was cool
09-08-2018T21:13:05,Combak,In the Foundry map?
09-08-2018T21:13:10,ShammyTV,Yeah it was Foundry
09-08-2018T21:13:16,ShammyTV,And nah Metal you couldn't do that in 3
09-08-2018T21:13:19,ShammyTV,Or Reach
09-08-2018T21:13:22,ShammyTV,Trust me I tried a lot
09-08-2018T21:13:26,Combak,"I starting making a Reach version, but never got that far on it."
09-08-2018T21:13:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I want more games to do stuff like that, 6 ways of move ment"
09-08-2018T21:13:32,MetalAppleSauce,Then my mind is playing tricks on me
09-08-2018T21:13:33,ShammyTV,I made a map like that in Reach
09-08-2018T21:13:51,Combak,Cool!
09-08-2018T21:14:15,Mippy,*Knows nothing about Halo so is going to get cake*
09-08-2018T21:14:20,BluePhantom90,Wow I just watch Season 7 of Voltron on Netflix. IT WAS SICK!!!!! I was on the edge of my seat for a while
09-08-2018T21:14:26,ShammyTV,Another issue with Reach's maps is that there were so few physics objects
09-08-2018T21:14:29,Strongpaw,Kat uses LICK! Its Super Effective!
09-08-2018T21:14:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,disgusting
09-08-2018T21:14:47,Gundurr,"Kat uses Pheromones, its also super effective"
09-08-2018T21:14:54,ShammyTV,Like 50% of the mini games people made in 3 weren't able to be remade in Reach because there were no physics objects
09-08-2018T21:15:12,MetalAppleSauce,No physics objects?
09-08-2018T21:15:15,HobbitGames,How did Zen put on dem pants? Wouldnt his floofy tail prevent them going on?
09-08-2018T21:15:15,BluePhantom90,would she even have Pheromones?
09-08-2018T21:15:35,ShammyTV,Like objects you could move with explosions and shit
09-08-2018T21:15:40,ShammyTV,"Jenga Tower, Omega Journey"
09-08-2018T21:15:41,MetalAppleSauce,@HobbitGames you underestimate the power of every single furry in existence
09-08-2018T21:15:43,ShammyTV,Knocking shit over
09-08-2018T21:15:55,Combak,"Yeah, that really sucked."
09-08-2018T21:15:55,HobbitGames,Hahahaha
09-08-2018T21:16:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I remember janga in reach
09-08-2018T21:16:04,ShammyTV,It was trash in Reach
09-08-2018T21:16:08,ShammyTV,Because they could only use like
09-08-2018T21:16:10,ShammyTV,The dice
09-08-2018T21:16:12,w0lfmare,:cw0lfmare-HeadEmber:
09-08-2018T21:16:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi W0lfy
09-08-2018T21:16:19,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, w0lf."
09-08-2018T21:16:21,w0lfmare,Hello
09-08-2018T21:16:25,MetalAppleSauce,You can edit the physics of objects tho
09-08-2018T21:16:28,ShammyTV,Nope
09-08-2018T21:16:31,ZahnHolley,Howdy wolf
09-08-2018T21:16:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yeah
09-08-2018T21:16:34,ShammyTV,Once they're placed they become static
09-08-2018T21:16:47,Combak,"I wanted to make a remake of 3's Blockdrop Court in Reach, and quickly realized I couldn't."
09-08-2018T21:16:51,ShammyTV,If you put something on Normal physics it bounces around until it stops moving
09-08-2018T21:16:57,ShammyTV,Then it locks in place
09-08-2018T21:17:04,ShammyTV,And can't be moved
09-08-2018T21:17:12,ShammyTV,I was piiissseedd when I found that out
09-08-2018T21:17:36,Combak,"On one hand, it removed the ""Bump"" from 3."
09-08-2018T21:17:43,Combak,On the other... so many things lost.
09-08-2018T21:17:53,ShammyTV,"The bump didn't affect anything but machinima though, really"
09-08-2018T21:18:06,Combak,Yep.
09-08-2018T21:18:12,ShammyTV,Not a worthwhile trade IMO haha
09-08-2018T21:18:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"when building fortresses, the bump was a nightmare"
09-08-2018T21:18:36,qwe304,is the stream still 720p?
09-08-2018T21:18:37,Combak,"Eh, it might have been part of the whole Forge rework they did."
09-08-2018T21:18:40,Combak,Who knows?
09-08-2018T21:19:02,ShammyTV,It wasn't a thing on the forge canvas maps though
09-08-2018T21:19:14,ShammyTV,Bump didn't affect structural objects on Sandbox or Foundry
09-08-2018T21:19:19,ShammyTV,Or Standoff or Avalanche
09-08-2018T21:19:35,ShammyTV,Which were pretty much the only maps with enough objects to make fortresses on anyways
09-08-2018T21:20:06,Twokinds,I forgot to change it again
09-08-2018T21:20:13,Bgrmystr2,rip
09-08-2018T21:20:16,HobbitGames,Why has this conversation happened?
09-08-2018T21:20:32,Gundurr,Forgot to change what?
09-08-2018T21:21:19,qwe304,stream resoloution
09-08-2018T21:21:35,qwe304,its noticeable
09-08-2018T21:21:41,MetalAppleSauce,"to you, mabye"
09-08-2018T21:21:46,Zakuru,^
09-08-2018T21:21:59,Gundurr,I didnt notice anything change
09-08-2018T21:22:01,qwe304,tou anyone with a sharp eye
09-08-2018T21:22:07,Afallingtree,That‚Äôs probably why I can watch the stream without lagging out
09-08-2018T21:22:10,MetalAppleSauce,"I mean, to be fair, half the chat scrolled down due to the mere sight of this"
09-08-2018T21:22:35,Bgrmystr2,"I'm watchin all 3 atm, so the stream is fairly small for me"
09-08-2018T21:22:45,Bgrmystr2,doin other things atm
09-08-2018T21:22:56,ZRO4825,flops into the chat. X.x

09-08-2018T21:23:13,Zakuru,oh boy
09-08-2018T21:23:17,ZahnHolley,"Pretty sexy,"
09-08-2018T21:23:34,qwe304,loows lower than 720 tbh
09-08-2018T21:23:37,Zakuru,zros flopping or the platonic kissing?
09-08-2018T21:23:45,Bgrmystr2,@Zak yes
09-08-2018T21:23:50,HobbitGames,Will this be patron only?
09-08-2018T21:24:04,totallynotTrace,"why not both, Zak?"
09-08-2018T21:24:06,Bgrmystr2,it'll be posted on his deviantart if it is
09-08-2018T21:24:07,Zakuru,i dont think patreon thinks its sexy enough
09-08-2018T21:24:17,Bgrmystr2,so don't worry
09-08-2018T21:24:19,FoxxTrotter,"Hey, ZRO."
09-08-2018T21:24:42,totallynotTrace,idk it has both boob and butt if youre reffering to Toms stream
09-08-2018T21:25:00,HobbitGames,Thats why i was asking
09-08-2018T21:25:07,totallynotTrace,so it might have to be patreon only
09-08-2018T21:25:09,Flake,thought patreon been having issues lately with payments?
09-08-2018T21:25:15,BadFoMo,Back.

09-08-2018T21:30:00,BadFoMo,That should fix it.

09-08-2018T22:30:46,KiTA,So he's kissing Kat while thinking of his sister?  That's uh...  odd

09-08-2018T22:33:24,Twokinds,I had a teacher named Vaughan
09-08-2018T22:33:26,Russianconservative,the moment you search Vaughan you get Vaughan mills which is located in greater toronto
09-08-2018T22:33:37,Russianconservative,oh that makes sense

09-08-2018T23:44:32,Bgrmystr2,"At this point, Tomato, you may be right..."
09-08-2018T23:44:53,TomatoBasket,I always am :ptv-condescending:
09-08-2018T23:45:05,TomatoBasket,but darn that is a cute comic to read.
09-08-2018T23:45:14,TomatoBasket,I reached the last published chapter so darn fast.
09-08-2018T23:45:15,Afallingtree,What comic?
09-08-2018T23:45:41,TomatoBasket,The one where there is a large dog guy in an apartment who has a pet human girl. they cuddle on the sofa and everything.
09-08-2018T23:45:55,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
09-08-2018T23:45:56,JamesBSquirrel3,Sam + Colin - got'cha!:ptv-victory:
09-08-2018T23:46:05,Afallingtree,Lol
09-08-2018T23:46:12,TomatoBasket,This gave me a flashback to 30 minutes ago when I read the last page.
09-08-2018T23:46:12,Mippy,Oh....Tomato is from the future
09-08-2018T23:46:26,Bgrmystr2,"Is this a subtle reference, or is there an actual comic of this, Tomato?"
09-08-2018T23:46:34,TomatoBasket,Actual comic.
09-08-2018T23:46:38,Bgrmystr2,wot is it?
09-08-2018T23:46:46,TomatoBasket,Let me go find it again.
09-08-2018T23:47:05,TomatoBasket,But Tom's drawing this today is such a happy cooincidence.
09-08-2018T23:47:19,TomatoBasket,It made me smile so hard.
09-08-2018T23:47:48,TomatoBasket,The Beast and His Pet High School Girl
09-08-2018T23:47:56,TomatoBasket,It is so fluffy and cuddly.
09-08-2018T23:48:36,Bgrmystr2,w-.. okay
09-08-2018T23:48:39,Bgrmystr2,Why not
09-08-2018T23:49:00,TomatoBasket,I just finished reading it.
09-08-2018T23:49:23,JamesBSquirrel3,":ptv-ohmy: Wow! She a warrior! And what her name - cause I never seen that one was, Sage?:ptv-wondering:"
09-08-2018T23:49:25,SageSaga,"Trains are missiles now, nothing makes sense"
09-08-2018T23:49:28,TomatoBasket,"And then came here because I wanted to watch someone stream art. Saw tom, and then saw this picture he is doing, and was all. ""Wow. what a coinky-dink!"""
09-08-2018T23:49:45,TomatoBasket,@SageSaga they are?
09-08-2018T23:50:20,Mippy,:ptv-shock: Realized Arthur is the only reason I know how to spell Aardvark
09-08-2018T23:50:35,SageSaga,"it was some video game, they said they put bombs on trains turning them into missiles - and it was like - ""Uhh- im pretty sure putting a bomb on a train doesnt make it a missile-"""
09-08-2018T23:51:01,TomatoBasket,Oh.... yeah. it technically needs to fly to become a missile.
09-08-2018T23:51:13,TomatoBasket,"Perhaps a torpedo, but a missile, no."
09-08-2018T23:51:19,Zakuru,torpedos are underwater
09-08-2018T23:51:39,TomatoBasket,there is a technical classification.
09-08-2018T23:51:41,TomatoBasket,Let me go find itr.
09-08-2018T23:51:43,SageSaga,"James, It's Kate dressed up as Saber from Fate/Stay Night"
09-08-2018T23:52:35,InTheLionsDen,Perhaps the train/spaceships from Galaxy Express 999
09-08-2018T23:52:42,Tharkis,"okies, time for me to crash in bed, got a train to catch in the morning for day 2 of boston comicon \o/"

09-08-2018T23:56:37,Bgrmystr2,sokay
09-08-2018T23:56:40,Zakuru,nighty
09-08-2018T23:56:44,Bgrmystr2,I need not exist
09-08-2018T23:57:05,ZRO4825,Some days not existing is indeed the superior option. Allows for better stealth rolls.
09-08-2018T23:57:15,Zakuru,eeeyyy
09-08-2018T23:57:19,TomatoBasket,"@ Zakuru Torpedo. The long cigar shape gives it the name torpedo. While a naval weapon, the word has been used for explosive devices used on land. Another possible name would be a torpedo mine or something. It isn't a traditional weapon."
09-08-2018T23:58:11,TomatoBasket,I figure a train filled with bombs would be a torpedo if it never leaves the ground.
09-08-2018T23:58:40,Gundurr,speeding missile
09-08-2018T23:58:49,TheBeckoner,You exist to me Bgr~
09-08-2018T23:58:57,Bgrmystr2,aw beck &lt;3
09-08-2018T23:59:27,Alphawolf333,"I don't though, I'm just a figment of everyone's collective imaginations"
09-08-2018T23:59:39,TomatoBasket,"yes you are, Alphawolf333"
09-08-2018T23:59:43,Gundurr,this image is making feel all warm and fuzzy
09-08-2018T23:59:59,TomatoBasket,so warm... fluffy... and warm... and comfy.
