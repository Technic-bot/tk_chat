02-01-2018T00:11:31,Serpentfrog,Look at all that wasted space on the cover. Raine is losing ad revenue.
02-01-2018T00:11:33,unsteddyphoenix,What we really need is more Trace as Master CHEF
02-01-2018T00:11:36,KuroganeWatanoshi,so a cintiq is like a computer monitor but you can drw on the screen?
02-01-2018T00:11:42,CrRAR,XD

02-01-2018T00:12:06,KuroganeWatanoshi,all I have is a Intuos Wacom Tablet xD
02-01-2018T00:12:10,unsteddyphoenix,What you dont know is the ending of the fanfic is behind a paywall
02-01-2018T00:12:19,CrRAR,das pretty good kuro
02-01-2018T00:12:25,KuroganeWatanoshi,heh.

02-01-2018T00:12:44,Serpentfrog,All I have is a brick and a nearby electronics shop.
02-01-2018T00:12:52,unsteddyphoenix,That'll do pig
02-01-2018T00:12:56,NeonMitsumi,Lolwut
02-01-2018T00:13:01,CrRAR,haha
02-01-2018T00:13:04,KuroganeWatanoshi,I draw my own art because I am either too broke to commission someone or now one will commission me so.. yeah xD
02-01-2018T00:13:12,KuroganeWatanoshi,no*
02-01-2018T00:13:19,BadFoMo,I think I voted this to be colored due to Raine's face.
02-01-2018T00:13:21,unsteddyphoenix,Get commissions to get money for commissions
02-01-2018T00:13:22,unsteddyphoenix,Smart
02-01-2018T00:13:24,NeonMitsumi,"I mean, trades are an option."
02-01-2018T00:13:44,CrRAR,Raine: Dealmaker
02-01-2018T00:13:50,KuroganeWatanoshi,Like I said. No one will commission me xD so either way it's a lose lose situation
02-01-2018T00:13:55,Serpentfrog,Pro life tip: get other people to want to draw your art. That's how I got all my commissions because I'm a cheapskate.
02-01-2018T00:14:10,unsteddyphoenix,tactical
02-01-2018T00:14:13,NeonMitsumi,Or get me to give ideas.
02-01-2018T00:14:15,KuroganeWatanoshi,heh
02-01-2018T00:14:15,CrRAR,legitimate strategy

02-01-2018T00:14:46,KuroganeWatanoshi,"But now I am doing a sort of ""project"" so to speak for this comic. like a fanart thing"
02-01-2018T00:14:51,NeonMitsumi,Did you name the alot yet?
02-01-2018T00:14:51,DontuDare,Fun and intereactive Gameplay
02-01-2018T00:14:56,KuroganeWatanoshi,I am drawing all the characters basically
02-01-2018T00:15:06,Serpentfrog,"Oh shit, I need to do that."
02-01-2018T00:15:20,KuroganeWatanoshi,xD
02-01-2018T00:15:29,KuroganeWatanoshi,So far I have trace and flora done
02-01-2018T00:15:36,CrRAR,noice
02-01-2018T00:15:38,Bgrmystr2,"Kuro, there's a reason people post their art on sites like Deviantart and Furaffinity"
02-01-2018T00:15:39,MisanthropyComics,hey
02-01-2018T00:15:40,KuroganeWatanoshi,now I am going to be doing Keith Keiser
02-01-2018T00:15:45,BluePhantom90,You know Tom you should really Put Raine's ShipFic's. I mean It would be a laugh a random book just happens to fall out of no where
02-01-2018T00:15:48,Serpentfrog,First rule of fanart: don't talk about fanart.
02-01-2018T00:15:54,KuroganeWatanoshi,oh?
02-01-2018T00:15:56,KuroganeWatanoshi,ehy?
02-01-2018T00:15:59,KuroganeWatanoshi,why*
02-01-2018T00:16:04,MisanthropyComics,how are you guys?
02-01-2018T00:16:09,KuroganeWatanoshi,I am fine
02-01-2018T00:16:14,Serpentfrog,Maximum cringe and humility and stuff.
02-01-2018T00:16:19,Bgrmystr2,"because people can see your art, and then they may want you to draw something. That's how people look for commissions."
02-01-2018T00:16:26,Bgrmystr2,by looking at the artist's work.
02-01-2018T00:17:15,KuroganeWatanoshi,"yeah, obviously. I have FA and DA. But I don't go flaunting it about on other people's streams... that is just a bad move"
02-01-2018T00:17:30,Serpentfrog,"I am too misanthropic to answer stranger's questions, Comics."
02-01-2018T00:17:31,KuroganeWatanoshi,and really disrespectful
02-01-2018T00:17:34,Bgrmystr2,Well of course not
02-01-2018T00:17:44,KuroganeWatanoshi,heh
02-01-2018T00:18:10,Bgrmystr2,maybe you should think about streaming your art with other people who stream. :v
02-01-2018T00:18:25,KuroganeWatanoshi,I tried streaming
02-01-2018T00:18:26,Bgrmystr2,"could get you some new followers, etc"
02-01-2018T00:18:31,KuroganeWatanoshi,It won't work for me
02-01-2018T00:18:32,Serpentfrog,Maybe you should draw for the joy of drawing.
02-01-2018T00:18:40,KuroganeWatanoshi,I do that xD
02-01-2018T00:18:44,Serpentfrog,Good.
02-01-2018T00:18:48,KuroganeWatanoshi,yeps

02-01-2018T00:19:15,unsteddyphoenix,"The only truth is ""get gud"" :/"
02-01-2018T00:19:17,KuroganeWatanoshi,all it takes is practice
02-01-2018T00:19:21,unsteddyphoenix,Sadly~

02-01-2018T00:20:56,Serpentfrog,Embiggens is truly the most cromulent of words.
02-01-2018T00:21:05,Russianconservative,It’s not like you made a webcomic a thing that is compromised of drawings
02-01-2018T00:21:09,KuroganeWatanoshi,is going to fix me up some chicken flavoured Maruchan Ramen
02-01-2018T00:21:10,CrRAR,"Also, Raine literally has the BEST outfits!"
