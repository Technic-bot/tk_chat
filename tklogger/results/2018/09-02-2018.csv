09-02-2018T00:15:26,RedDeath2018,"I would cosplay as link and go sneak off to Tom’s table, get his autograph and a picture with him and it would be awesome. One day maybe"

09-02-2018T00:21:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Sage just remember what those tree little birds told you

09-02-2018T00:30:03,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, do you think maybe it's cuz Nami's body doesn't seem right if they're laying on a bed. It looks like she would be laying down sideways, but.."
09-02-2018T00:30:10,Bgrmystr2,"she's leaning upwards in blue's arm, so it looks kinda like she just kinda.. makes a 45 degree angle with her spine"

09-02-2018T00:53:56,MagicEnchilladas,ive recently been watching Kino'sJourney
09-02-2018T00:53:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"trash you say, might have to check it out"
09-02-2018T00:54:09,aeoronwah,"Hating Record of Grancrest War, absolutely loving DARLING in the FRANXX"
09-02-2018T00:54:11,Tharkis,"Death March so far is entertaining, but having not read the LN/manga i'm wondering where they're going with the explaination for yet another 'in another world' anime"
09-02-2018T00:54:45,SageSaga,i was so worried about Death March turning into the next In another world with my cell phone
09-02-2018T00:54:50,SageSaga,that i read the manga
09-02-2018T00:54:51,Tharkis,i like how they're dealing with 'op twink' character  so far.
09-02-2018T00:55:09,aeoronwah,"Oh holy fuck, In another world with my smartphone was so bad"
09-02-2018T00:55:20,aeoronwah,I tried to go back and rewatch an episode of it
09-02-2018T00:55:22,SageSaga,ive also been reading the comments on it and i was so happy i did
09-02-2018T00:55:44,SageSaga,so the manga is ok - its not great- its not amazing- but its fun and interesting
09-02-2018T00:55:59,Tharkis,tbh fun and interesting is all i'm /really/ looking for heh
09-02-2018T00:56:04,SageSaga,but i read this comment and i just lost it-
09-02-2018T00:56:26,Tharkis,for 'real cool story' on the same lines i'm waiting for more Log Horizion
09-02-2018T00:56:31,SageSaga,"Sage: ""Eyuuuugh... And with the slutty 12 year old, I'm out :/"""
09-02-2018T00:56:36,Tharkis,but that could be a long wait =(

09-02-2018T00:56:45,Tharkis,lol
09-02-2018T00:56:45,aeoronwah,I doubt there will ever be any more
09-02-2018T00:56:53,SageSaga,it says Sage because i copied it from my IM
09-02-2018T00:57:02,SageSaga,that wasnt my quote
09-02-2018T00:57:17,unsteddyphoenix,After Kannas big-forehead friend im probably immune to that by now

09-02-2018T02:23:07,SageSaga,he has an attack that will do that almost regardless of your stats
09-02-2018T02:23:18,SageSaga,you have a few options- learn to see it coming and dodge-

09-02-2018T02:26:17,SageSaga,other option- dont let him dive
09-02-2018T02:26:55,ZRO4825,?
09-02-2018T02:27:25,SageSaga,he should only dive if his spikes are fully grown and black
09-02-2018T02:27:32,SageSaga,if you break them enough he will never dive
09-02-2018T02:28:10,Dadrobit,Back.
09-02-2018T02:28:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,wb father figure
09-02-2018T02:28:35,SageSaga,wb
09-02-2018T02:29:06,Dadrobit,"And yeah, Nergigante killed me the first time as well, but he gets ez when you do figure him out. All of his stuff is pretty well telegraphed."
09-02-2018T02:29:42,SageSaga,also SOS it- because people are farming him a lot
09-02-2018T02:30:28,SageSaga,you'll sometimes have some kinda ninja join you that will destroy it for you
09-02-2018T02:31:39,Dadrobit,"Yeah, a lot of the end game gear requires his parts, so people are always filling those slots quickly."
09-02-2018T02:31:52,Dadrobit,You'll have a 4-man before you even get to see him.
09-02-2018T02:33:01,SageSaga,teostra was a pain for me because i took a bow to fight him- fired off a massive wave of arrows-
09-02-2018T02:33:09,SageSaga,Zero damage on every hit-
09-02-2018T02:33:15,SageSaga,i was like - wat!?
09-02-2018T02:33:45,Dadrobit,"Can confirm, as a bow one trick, Teostra is a right bastard sometimes."
09-02-2018T02:34:20,Dadrobit,"It's not that he kills you, it's just that he takes an eternity to kill"
09-02-2018T02:34:21,SageSaga,once you start treating the bow like a hammer on him its not bad though
09-02-2018T02:34:41,SageSaga,just keep hitting him in the head and he'll go down
09-02-2018T02:35:24,Dadrobit,"Ayep, unless I'm going for a specific break, it's just headshots erryday."
09-02-2018T02:36:19,SageSaga,if im going to try and break something on Teostra im grabbing my hammer or sword and shield
09-02-2018T02:36:24,Dadrobit,And dragon piercer of course
09-02-2018T02:37:16,SageSaga,dragon piercer leaves you too open against Teostra
09-02-2018T02:37:37,Dadrobit,Bringing the shield palico helps
09-02-2018T02:40:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"just go in with your fists, like john wayne would"
09-02-2018T02:45:06,Bgrmystr2,ayy I finally know where this song is from :D
09-02-2018T02:45:50,Bgrmystr2,"Log Horizon was surprisingly good. It didn't have me hooked at the beginning, but it eneded up being a great watch."
09-02-2018T02:56:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,6 hours
09-02-2018T03:01:49,Dadrobit,Quick question!
09-02-2018T03:01:58,SageSaga,?
09-02-2018T03:02:00,Dadrobit,Y'all are giant weebs right?
09-02-2018T03:02:07,Dadrobit,I need help identifying something
09-02-2018T03:02:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,unsteddy is
09-02-2018T03:02:11,SageSaga,pretty much
09-02-2018T03:02:15,MagicEnchilladas,kinda
09-02-2018T03:02:22,Dadrobit,There's this car on campus
09-02-2018T03:02:25,Dadrobit,https://imgur.com/a/YpAgT
09-02-2018T03:02:25,Bgrmystr2,"I wouldn't use that term, but I guess"
09-02-2018T03:02:40,Dadrobit,Any idea?
09-02-2018T03:02:49,Dadrobit,Or is it just random catgirls?
09-02-2018T03:03:03,ZRO4825,Random catgirls from the looks of it
09-02-2018T03:03:06,Bgrmystr2,I'll check MAL
09-02-2018T03:03:10,ZRO4825,At least they're not ones I recognize
09-02-2018T03:03:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,on the back the hemlet is Celty from Durarara
09-02-2018T03:03:21,DarthRexKing,I am going to bed. Goodnight.
09-02-2018T03:03:23,SageSaga,the catgirls are probably random- ive never seen em before- and yeah was gonna mention that Marv
09-02-2018T03:03:32,SageSaga,night Dath
09-02-2018T03:03:35,SageSaga,Darth*

09-02-2018T03:03:43,Dadrobit,Night Darth
09-02-2018T03:04:01,Bgrmystr2,I found it
09-02-2018T03:04:06,DarthRexKing,I'm taking the robit to isengard!
09-02-2018T03:04:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"also my naighbor jotero, and bleach"
09-02-2018T03:04:08,Bgrmystr2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/15225/Hentai_Ouji_to_Warawanai_Neko Here you go :)
09-02-2018T03:05:30,Dadrobit,"Wow, literally driving around town with Hentai girls on your car."
09-02-2018T03:05:37,Dadrobit,Stay classy AZ.
09-02-2018T03:05:44,Bgrmystr2,"lol it's not a hentai, it's a comedy anime"
09-02-2018T03:05:46,SageSaga,i wish that were my car
09-02-2018T03:05:50,SageSaga,and yeah its not hentai
09-02-2018T03:05:59,Bgrmystr2,It's rated PG-13
09-02-2018T03:06:06,Dadrobit,"I mean, it's the first word in the title?"
09-02-2018T03:06:12,SageSaga,hentai means pervert
09-02-2018T03:06:25,SageSaga,it doesnt mean porn
09-02-2018T03:06:31,Dadrobit,"Huh, the more you know!"
09-02-2018T03:06:33,ZRO4825,"Just because it says hentai, doesn't mean it's A hentai :P"
09-02-2018T03:06:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,hentai means pervert right?
09-02-2018T03:06:56,Dadrobit,"See, this is why I asked."
09-02-2018T03:07:47,Bgrmystr2,"The art is from Kantoku, the large one anyway."
09-02-2018T03:07:54,Bgrmystr2,"he's a very, VERY popular artist"
09-02-2018T03:08:15,Bgrmystr2,he did the character designs for the show
09-02-2018T03:08:18,Bgrmystr2,apparently
09-02-2018T03:09:03,Dadrobit,My knowledge of these things is very limited. Haven't watched an anime in forever tbh. Last one I watched was Neo Yokio.
09-02-2018T03:09:23,aeoronwah,Wasn't that the one Jaden smith was in?
09-02-2018T03:09:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"you should check out devilman crybaby, dad"
09-02-2018T03:09:45,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah it looks like all of three characters on there are from Kantoku, the large one is from the anime for sure, not sure about the two smaller ones"
09-02-2018T03:09:58,MagicEnchilladas,yes aeoron
09-02-2018T03:10:01,Dadrobit,"Yeah, Jaden voiced the main character. No joke, it's amazing for the first like 4 episodes."
09-02-2018T03:10:20,SageSaga,"Tom , you still here?"
09-02-2018T03:10:21,Dadrobit,"Then it gets up its own ass in the last two episodes and loses a lot of its char,"
09-02-2018T03:10:26,Dadrobit,charm
09-02-2018T03:11:15,Bgrmystr2,"looks like all the characters are part of the anime, but with different color hair. Could be just the image. Could also be the picture was edited before putting it on the vehicle."
09-02-2018T03:11:20,Bgrmystr2,could also be weathering
09-02-2018T03:11:33,Bgrmystr2,"not sure how the colors change, if they fade, etc"
09-02-2018T03:11:40,Bgrmystr2,but yeah that's what it looks like to me :)
09-02-2018T03:12:13,Dadrobit,The printing went to crap on the car. The sun does that to things out here sadly.
09-02-2018T03:13:36,Bgrmystr2,"The large image on the left, her outfit is supposed to be brown"
09-02-2018T03:13:47,Bgrmystr2,as are the ears
09-02-2018T03:14:22,Bgrmystr2,"so if it was actually colored correctly, the wearing destroyed the colors on that car, which is super unfortunate"
09-02-2018T03:14:25,Bgrmystr2,nice catch though :D
09-02-2018T03:16:44,Dadrobit,Seen it in the lot a couple times before I finally took a picture of it. The driver is probably one of the clowns that takes over the lunch lounge area around noon.
09-02-2018T03:17:22,Dadrobit,There are a bunch of folks that bring in their own entertainment and take over all the TVs in the lounge.
09-02-2018T03:17:37,Dadrobit,Which I wouldn't have a problem with honestly.
09-02-2018T03:17:47,Dadrobit,If they weren't so goddamned loud!
09-02-2018T03:18:26,Bgrmystr2,dunno.
09-02-2018T03:19:08,ZRO4825,"Yeah, I'd be the same way, don't mind peeps doing what they want for the most part, so long as they're not being obnoxious about it :x"
09-02-2018T03:19:27,Dadrobit,It's obnoxious to the extreme...
09-02-2018T03:20:09,Dadrobit,Enough so that campus security has had to evict them on several occasions.
09-02-2018T03:20:23,ZRO4825,Jeez
09-02-2018T03:21:13,Bgrmystr2,"You'd have to see if it's the same guy though, cuz you never know."
09-02-2018T03:21:16,Bgrmystr2,Could be someone else.
09-02-2018T03:22:11,Dadrobit,I have no idea who the driver is. I'm just making a baseless assumption that he or she is part of the group that hijacks the lounge.
09-02-2018T03:22:20,Bgrmystr2,xD
09-02-2018T03:22:22,Bgrmystr2,I can tell
09-02-2018T03:23:28,aeoronwah,"I can't tell, is she stabbing or slashing that thing. Like her arm seems more like it's sticking out from her stabbing it, but it looks like it's been sliced. Just looks kinda off"
09-02-2018T03:23:31,SageSaga,darn weebs always hijacking tech to get their anime fix
09-02-2018T03:24:10,Dadrobit,"And it sucks, because I really don't mind some of what they bring in. It's cool to grab a cup of coffee and see Princess Mononoke on one of the TVs. I'm cool w/ that"
09-02-2018T03:24:42,Dadrobit,But when they start fucking jumping up and down on the lounge furniture shouting lines from the movie on top of it...
09-02-2018T03:24:56,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: thefok
09-02-2018T03:25:06,Bgrmystr2,that's for home
09-02-2018T03:25:07,ZRO4825,facepalms.
09-02-2018T03:25:14,Dadrobit,I wish I was joking man....
09-02-2018T03:25:18,Bgrmystr2,"where is this happening, Dadro?"
09-02-2018T03:25:26,ZRO4825,(So we know where not to go)
09-02-2018T03:25:30,Dadrobit,College lunch lounge
09-02-2018T03:25:34,Dadrobit,MCC
09-02-2018T03:25:44,Bgrmystr2,"oh, yeah see that's kinda dumb"
09-02-2018T03:25:55,SageSaga,"just yell ""Your waifu is trash dog!"""
09-02-2018T03:25:57,Bgrmystr2,I wouldn't be jumping on the couch and shit
09-02-2018T03:25:59,Bgrmystr2,LOL sage
09-02-2018T03:26:09,Dadrobit,Hahahahaha
09-02-2018T03:26:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,well thats just rude
09-02-2018T03:26:21,aeoronwah,That sounds like the upstairs lunch lounge at my school as well Dad
09-02-2018T03:26:28,SageSaga,it's probably Emelia
09-02-2018T03:27:41,Dadrobit,"Most of the time I just go to one of the other lounges on campus now. It's a longer walk, but it saves me some cringe,"
09-02-2018T03:28:15,aeoronwah,"I've started eating in the basement area, right outside of our coffee shop"
09-02-2018T03:29:37,Dadrobit,"There's a coffee shop built into the library, so I grab that an a sandwich if I'm peckish and head up to the third floor lounge/observatory."
09-02-2018T03:29:43,Dadrobit,and*
09-02-2018T03:30:28,SageSaga,i usually just eat in my room
09-02-2018T03:30:53,aeoronwah,When I'm at home I can eat in my room
09-02-2018T03:30:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,same
09-02-2018T03:31:02,Dadrobit,"To be fair, that's what I usually do as well. But sometimes I get adventurous and go into the outside."
09-02-2018T03:31:09,aeoronwah,But I'm at school most of the time
09-02-2018T03:31:12,aeoronwah,or at work
09-02-2018T03:31:42,Dadrobit,Working from home is the best and the worst.
09-02-2018T03:32:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"depends on what your doing, but yeah"
09-02-2018T03:32:28,Dadrobit,"Cause you get to stay home as much as you want, but you still have to work, and home can turn into work. feelsbadman"
09-02-2018T03:32:40,aeoronwah,"Sometimes I wish I could work from home, but I would probably never get out of my house if that was the case."
09-02-2018T03:32:57,SageSaga,i rarely leave the house o-o
09-02-2018T03:33:11,aeoronwah,I leave the house every day.
09-02-2018T03:33:14,SageSaga,but i do get out more than Tom!
09-02-2018T03:33:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
09-02-2018T03:33:24,Dadrobit,"Lol,"
09-02-2018T03:33:49,aeoronwah,So does Tom just only leave the house for cons then? lol
09-02-2018T03:34:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,pretty sure he sends a clone for those
09-02-2018T03:34:17,SageSaga,how dare you
09-02-2018T03:34:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,what I would
09-02-2018T03:34:48,SageSaga,Tom wouldnt use a clone to go meet me
09-02-2018T03:34:48,Bgrmystr2,lolo
09-02-2018T03:34:53,Dadrobit,"Honestly, that kind of sedentary lifestyle scares me. Like, staying at home all day, and even ordering your food to be delivered to your house?"
09-02-2018T03:35:00,Bgrmystr2,are you SURE sage? :thinking:
09-02-2018T03:35:17,Dadrobit,I really do hope he goes out and does stuff sometimes.
09-02-2018T03:35:34,SageSaga,he and I are going to a convention in a few months
09-02-2018T03:35:57,Dadrobit,Which one?
09-02-2018T03:36:03,aeoronwah,You don't have to order food if you don't eat Dad
09-02-2018T03:36:11,Dadrobit,:thinking:
09-02-2018T03:36:41,aeoronwah,I don't make healthy food choices
09-02-2018T03:37:04,aeoronwah,"Like, occasionally forgetting to eat for like 2 days"
09-02-2018T03:37:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"how do you forget to eat, thats like the high light of the day"
09-02-2018T03:37:42,Dadrobit,"Ohhh, speaking of food, saw a new Mexican place I need to try out down the road."
09-02-2018T03:37:48,Dadrobit,Ericbertos
09-02-2018T03:37:56,aeoronwah,"I don't know, but that's probably why I'm only 120 lbs"
09-02-2018T03:37:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,berto?
09-02-2018T03:38:05,Dadrobit,berto indeed
09-02-2018T03:38:33,SageSaga,someone get that man a sandwich!
09-02-2018T03:38:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"and 120lbs, dude you need to spoil your self"
09-02-2018T03:38:59,Dadrobit,"Yeah, just a bit maybe"
09-02-2018T03:40:17,aeoronwah,"Hey, I already had a sandwich earlier."
09-02-2018T03:40:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,have like 3 more
09-02-2018T03:40:41,aeoronwah,But then I'd need to go to my kitchen
09-02-2018T03:40:47,aeoronwah,I don't wanna do that
09-02-2018T03:40:55,Bgrmystr2,God damn Aeoron that is relatable as fuck
09-02-2018T03:40:57,Dadrobit,Did your sandwich consist of more than crackers and a slice of cheese?
09-02-2018T03:41:10,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-sad: I know that feel 100%
09-02-2018T03:41:40,aeoronwah,"My sandwich was 1/4 pound of roast beef, a few strips of bacon, some onions, and lettuce."
09-02-2018T03:42:01,aeoronwah,On french bread
09-02-2018T03:42:05,aeoronwah,It was pretty good
09-02-2018T03:43:40,aeoronwah,"No cheese for me either most of the time, I'm lactose intolerant, which is a curse since I love pizza. But eating it kills me"
09-02-2018T03:44:04,ZRO4825,:(
09-02-2018T03:44:22,Dadrobit,"I know that feel somewhat. Bananas for me. I love them, they try to kill me, it's a relationship."
09-02-2018T03:47:59,Bgrmystr2,"I'm rather thankful I'm not allergic to anything. I just can't eat spicy foods for the life of me, :/"
09-02-2018T03:48:23,Dadrobit,No spicy? That would kill my soul.
09-02-2018T03:48:34,SageSaga,someone once said to me that we need to be more tolerant and i said I physically cant sometimes
09-02-2018T03:48:56,aeoronwah,"Spicy foods are great, I love spicy chicken curry."
09-02-2018T03:50:09,Dadrobit,There's a wing joint nearby that makes and sells DOPE ghost pepper sauce. I put that stuff on like half of the stuff I cook.
09-02-2018T03:51:25,Dadrobit,"Damn, mouth is actually watering. Brb, gonna get a snack."
09-02-2018T03:52:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"its like 2 am for you dad, snake sounds great right now"
09-02-2018T03:52:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,snack

09-02-2018T03:56:20,Bgrmystr2,so I can't do it
09-02-2018T03:56:34,Bgrmystr2,the smell itself I can feel burning my throat too
09-02-2018T03:56:39,Bgrmystr2,so that isn't fun either
09-02-2018T03:56:48,Dadrobit,"Wow, I'm so sorry man."

09-02-2018T03:57:11,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, you guys can eat fire if you like"
09-02-2018T03:57:12,Bgrmystr2,:D
09-02-2018T03:57:33,Bgrmystr2,"For every firefood I don't eat, that's a firefood that you can potentially eat."
09-02-2018T03:57:45,Bgrmystr2,so I'd consider that a win win.

09-02-2018T04:03:32,Bgrmystr2,"I didn't skip it, they kicked me out :ptv-sad:"
09-02-2018T04:04:08,Dadrobit,Maybe it's because he's only ever seen the guacamole form?
09-02-2018T04:04:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,thats what you get for throwing the tomatoes
09-02-2018T04:04:26,Bgrmystr2,"I have seen that, yes, and eeeugh do not want D;"
09-02-2018T04:05:03,Dadrobit,"It's alright, I don't order it on anything, but if it ends up in the dish I don't make too big a fuss."
09-02-2018T04:05:08,Bgrmystr2,"you know what, Dadro, we'll switch. I'll come live in the desert and you come here to Orleans and eat all the spicy everythings."
09-02-2018T04:05:31,Dadrobit,You realize that everything is spicy here too right?
09-02-2018T04:05:31,Bgrmystr2,"Take it. Take it all, I don't want any of it xD"
09-02-2018T04:05:40,Bgrmystr2,"It's ok, I won't survive a week"
09-02-2018T04:05:48,Dadrobit,"Like, I could walk to Mexico, we have all their spicy."
09-02-2018T04:06:00,Bgrmystr2,my body's ability to stay hydrated is abnormally low
09-02-2018T04:06:33,Bgrmystr2,"even with gatorade / powerade on me and drinking water all day, I still overheat, dehydrate, and straight to the hospital."
09-02-2018T04:06:43,Bgrmystr2,It's happened a few times
09-02-2018T04:06:55,Dadrobit,Making a note in my phone to hit up Ericberto's tomorrow and see what they have to offer...
09-02-2018T04:07:02,Bgrmystr2,"But think about this, you'd get all the morer spicy foods you could wanna eat here :D"
09-02-2018T04:07:25,Bgrmystr2,"plus, beignets"
09-02-2018T04:07:30,Bgrmystr2,cuz those are fucking awesome
09-02-2018T04:08:47,Dadrobit,And give up street vender churros and bunuelos? No thank yo!
09-02-2018T04:08:52,Dadrobit,you*
09-02-2018T04:09:07,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: hm.. Churros are amazing
09-02-2018T04:09:17,Bgrmystr2,They used to have them all the time at a place called Panchos
09-02-2018T04:09:36,Bgrmystr2,it closed down cuz Katrina basically.
09-02-2018T04:09:41,Bgrmystr2,which is sad
09-02-2018T04:09:49,Bgrmystr2,that was the last time I had a churro
09-02-2018T04:10:29,Dadrobit,"Sad, churro stands are everywhere out here."
09-02-2018T04:11:28,Bgrmystr2,yeah well.. you can get most anything based in orleans here. The beignets from Cafe Du Monde are sold in shops all over the place
09-02-2018T04:11:37,Bgrmystr2,though they'll never beat the shop itself
09-02-2018T04:11:58,Bgrmystr2,"lotta jazz stuff, lotta beer and alchohol"
09-02-2018T04:12:39,Bgrmystr2,Trade you some bars for churro stands
09-02-2018T04:12:43,Bgrmystr2,:D?

09-02-2018T04:17:30,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
09-02-2018T04:19:32,Bgrmystr2,"I would have said to trade some beignet shops but while they are everywhere, they're not like.. SUPER common, but you can buy the stuff to make you own in all sorts of shops"

09-02-2018T11:26:19,Nekonny,I wonder if I have too much stuff going on
09-02-2018T11:27:58,Tharkis,:ctharkis-earwiggle:
09-02-2018T11:28:01,Nekonny,"there, that should fix it"
09-02-2018T11:28:14,Mislakane,hello
09-02-2018T11:28:33,sunblaze,hiya
09-02-2018T11:28:39,Nekonny,OBS has this thing that it loads images even when it's not being displayed... so all my animations are running at the same time
09-02-2018T11:28:52,Nekonny,it's on by default
09-02-2018T11:29:05,Nekonny,so shutting it off one by one should improve performance quite a bit
09-02-2018T11:29:12,Nekonny,and hello everyone!
09-02-2018T11:30:11,Tharkis,"man, i thought i was fast on noticing the notice, but 26 people already in here"

09-02-2018T12:02:14,Nekonny,the script you guys did was an excelent templete though
09-02-2018T12:02:19,Tharkis,was just tryign to come up with things that seemed to fit the frames  at a rough pass
09-02-2018T12:02:48,Tharkis,oops minor consistency thingy
09-02-2018T12:03:01,Tharkis,the triangles on the collar arent in the top left frame
09-02-2018T12:03:24,Nekonny,the big thing as been trying to adjust the page format to fit the Printing templete
09-02-2018T12:03:47,Nekonny,which is a taller than what I used on the draft sketch
09-02-2018T12:03:54,Tharkis,aahh
09-02-2018T12:04:02,Tharkis,yeah that gives more room for text too hehe
09-02-2018T12:05:10,Tharkis,yeah that text works a lot better on this page

09-02-2018T12:24:47,Nekonny,hum
09-02-2018T12:25:06,Nekonny,I think that pahaps adding this to the nchan one wouldnt be a bad idea
09-02-2018T12:25:12,Nekonny,I could print them together
09-02-2018T12:25:17,Nekonny,like a double ocmic
09-02-2018T12:25:24,Nekonny,the nchan on is only 4 pages though
09-02-2018T12:25:39,Nekonny,"I don't have a 8 page tf comic ^_ """
09-02-2018T12:26:20,Watsup,right

09-02-2018T15:06:58,NightMeaty22,Yah finding thing to draw is hard
09-02-2018T15:08:18,NightMeaty22,But i kinda suck at drawing so...
09-02-2018T15:10:29,JaydenMozingo,"""Getting it wrong is the first step to getting it right."""
09-02-2018T15:10:44,NightMeaty22,Yes it is
09-02-2018T15:11:06,JaydenMozingo,I will forever remember those words from Tom
09-02-2018T15:11:15,NightMeaty22,Same
09-02-2018T15:11:38,JaydenMozingo,"""Practice makes perfect"" Is used often and sometimes said as a buffer"
09-02-2018T15:12:06,NightMeaty22,Drawing living things is hard for me i just draw inanament objects
09-02-2018T15:12:32,NightMeaty22,Or a logo

09-02-2018T15:13:41,JaydenMozingo,Lol yeah
09-02-2018T15:14:04,JaydenMozingo,But detail is what makes a drawing a 'drawing'
09-02-2018T15:14:52,NightMeaty22,I am ocd i cant draw small details and make them look right
09-02-2018T15:14:58,NightMeaty22,Lol
09-02-2018T15:15:30,JaydenMozingo,"If Tom and other artists wouldn't zoom in to tiny un-noticable things and detail them, the art would look plain"
09-02-2018T15:15:58,JaydenMozingo,"I'm OCD too man, but I try my best to throw it away and continue with life"
