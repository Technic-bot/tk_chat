14-12-2018T00:39:43,unsteddyphoenix,But is his mind in his mind?
14-12-2018T00:39:57,Ordithus,Technically?
14-12-2018T00:40:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Only if it is aware it is a mind
14-12-2018T00:40:11,Hg17Lamont2002,I’d say he is more sharing his thoughts then him being in his personal mind
14-12-2018T00:40:24,SageSaga,time to start working on my comic
14-12-2018T00:40:32,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-sleepoverA:

14-12-2018T00:40:46,Ordithus,Stair brush?
14-12-2018T00:40:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah deep mind Tom is probably a mix of white noise and constant screaming

14-12-2018T02:10:13,Ordithus,"Yeah, fuck that test"
14-12-2018T02:10:17,Ordithus,I repressed it
14-12-2018T02:10:21,Bgrmystr2,haha
14-12-2018T02:10:30,SageSaga,its a test for Glaucoma- your eye pressure is different if you are developing it
14-12-2018T02:10:32,SageSaga,or have it
14-12-2018T02:10:57,unsteddyphoenix,...huh. Is it only 4-eyed people that can get that?

14-12-2018T02:13:44,Dadrobit,Or anxiety attack more appropriately.
14-12-2018T02:14:18,SageSaga,"i couldnt stay still for it so they gave up and went for another test- and she pulled out this phaser looking device and i said ""Is that what yall use for the children?"""

14-12-2018T02:21:48,Ordithus,I once got a tooth drilled with no anesthesic.  Tickled.

14-12-2018T02:22:38,JeremySenpai,they gave me NoS. didn't work.
14-12-2018T02:22:57,Ordithus,Laughing gas at least works.  Great
14-12-2018T02:22:59,Dadrobit,"Last filling I got a few years back, they fucked up the painkiller shot and literally struck a nerve. Felt like getting a stungun in the mouth and prevented the painkiller from working, so they had to do the operation with me feeling fucking everything."

14-12-2018T02:24:17,Ordithus,Huh.  I did not have the same experience.
14-12-2018T02:25:13,unsteddyphoenix,I also have not had that experience
14-12-2018T02:25:35,unsteddyphoenix,I assume afterwards they spray painted your teeth chrome?
14-12-2018T02:27:29,Dadrobit,"I did not ride eternal, shiny and chrome. I rushed to the porcelain throne and evacuated my stomach."
14-12-2018T02:27:58,Dadrobit,Spent the day on leftover painkillers in bed.

14-12-2018T02:31:55,RimaDraws,wisdom tooth surgery was good for me
14-12-2018T02:32:04,SpazztasticKiwi,They were growing at an angle to my regular teeth
14-12-2018T02:32:06,Dadrobit,"Do more stupid shit like me, unsteddy."
14-12-2018T02:32:16,Dadrobit,Injuries will follow.
14-12-2018T02:32:25,Dadrobit,Followed then by the painkillers.
14-12-2018T02:32:25,unsteddyphoenix,Wise words from a pro
14-12-2018T02:32:26,Ordithus,And traction!
14-12-2018T02:32:29,RimaDraws,thankfully my dad was the one who acted silly after his teeth removal surgeries
14-12-2018T02:32:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"Afterwards, I was tired but walked and talked and ate pretty normally"
14-12-2018T02:33:10,Dadrobit,"And of all my oral endeavors, wisdom teeth were fine. That was one I was put to sleep for."
14-12-2018T02:33:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Unlike my sister who slept after hers. Anesthetic hits us different
14-12-2018T02:33:45,RimaDraws,whoa what kind of conversation did i walk in on
14-12-2018T02:33:48,unsteddyphoenix,I still have my +WIS teeth and now im somewhat nervous
14-12-2018T02:34:04,unsteddyphoenix,Dad was telling us all about his oral endeavours~
14-12-2018T02:34:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Thing was when I slept I actually got to wake up feeling like it for awhile until a few hours. I had naps
14-12-2018T02:34:13,SpazztasticKiwi,But I wasn’t comatose
14-12-2018T02:34:18,RimaDraws,oh like i said my surgeries weren't bad
14-12-2018T02:34:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"Dadro, you need a better dentist"
14-12-2018T02:34:32,Ordithus,I found out I'm immune to morphine when I had my appendix removed
14-12-2018T02:34:47,RimaDraws,my first wisdom tooth removal took 45 mins to cut out but the top two with cavities took 20 mins total to get out
14-12-2018T02:34:59,RimaDraws,i have one left and it hasn't hurt me yet
14-12-2018T02:35:04,unsteddyphoenix,Were you not gassed when they removed your appendix what?
14-12-2018T02:35:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though in my experience, surgery doesn’t bother me. I have a nice pain threshold"
14-12-2018T02:35:12,Ordithus,I was gassed and KO'd
14-12-2018T02:35:16,RimaDraws,i never had any body surgery
14-12-2018T02:35:16,Ordithus,but it was after

14-12-2018T02:35:20,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh I see
14-12-2018T02:35:23,SpazztasticKiwi,But feck needles
14-12-2018T02:35:29,Ordithus,The real pain reliever was just getting the surgery done
14-12-2018T02:35:35,Ordithus,"God, the pain before surgery..."
14-12-2018T02:35:56,Ordithus,So.  Bad.
14-12-2018T02:35:57,SpazztasticKiwi,You seen Mark’s story on his appendix
14-12-2018T02:36:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Fun stuff there too

14-12-2018T02:36:31,SpazztasticKiwi,11
14-12-2018T02:36:44,Ordithus,"Ah, that was before I watched him"
14-12-2018T02:37:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Pretty sure it’s 11
14-12-2018T02:37:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Though he started YouTube in 12
14-12-2018T02:37:34,SpazztasticKiwi,And it was maybe a year into that
14-12-2018T02:37:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Something around there
14-12-2018T02:38:07,SpazztasticKiwi,He has a thing on twitch about it. And I don’t care to watch it again
14-12-2018T02:38:18,Dadrobit,"Yeah, ""GENTLE Dental"" my ass."
14-12-2018T02:38:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Ass isn’t where it goes
14-12-2018T02:38:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I see why you had pain

14-12-2018T02:39:32,SpazztasticKiwi,But seriously. Needles. No
14-12-2018T02:39:48,RimaDraws,i love my oral surgeons. they're my dad's surgeons so i was recommended to them by my dentist and my dad
14-12-2018T02:39:49,SpazztasticKiwi,No. Nope. Not a fan. Forget it. Get it away
14-12-2018T02:40:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Set it on fire and bury it
14-12-2018T02:40:07,RimaDraws,i can take needles better than i used to
14-12-2018T02:40:28,Ordithus,Needles are whatever
14-12-2018T02:40:30,Dadrobit,"Needle don't bother me all that much. Little bit, but not terrible. Used to get weekly shots for years when I was a youngin' for my allergies."
14-12-2018T02:40:39,Dadrobit,Needles*
14-12-2018T02:40:48,unsteddyphoenix,Needles used to completely traumatise me
14-12-2018T02:40:54,RimaDraws,same
14-12-2018T02:40:56,Bgrmystr2,needles aren't as bad as people who have no fucking idea how to needle you
14-12-2018T02:40:58,RimaDraws,but im okay with them
14-12-2018T02:41:11,unsteddyphoenix,Like I ran away from one and hid in the hospital for a couple hours before I had one
14-12-2018T02:41:18,Ordithus,Dang
14-12-2018T02:41:21,unsteddyphoenix,In a closet I believe
14-12-2018T02:41:25,RimaDraws,the one thing that gets me is if i have a shot put in me or get blood drawn and i dont eat
14-12-2018T02:41:27,unsteddyphoenix,"But now im fine, its weird"
14-12-2018T02:41:28,RimaDraws,oh boy
14-12-2018T02:41:40,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I had to be bribed out
14-12-2018T02:41:43,RimaDraws,all hell breaks loose and i get diaphoretic
14-12-2018T02:41:43,Bgrmystr2,"went to a checkup once, and this woman took a bigass needle when they were gonna take blood, and basically.. she never got blood at all."
14-12-2018T02:41:46,Ordithus,Drawing blood is a bit weird. Always makes me feel weird
14-12-2018T02:41:59,Bgrmystr2,several inches inside my arm of ow.
14-12-2018T02:42:01,unsteddyphoenix,"Oooh, pizzas here. brb/seeya"

14-12-2018T02:42:09,SpazztasticKiwi,If I could get blood drawn or a vaccine or whatever have you with out needles involved
14-12-2018T02:42:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d be good
14-12-2018T02:42:16,Dadrobit,"Sage, is that dude getting impaled by a blunt pole or is there no blade there yet?"
14-12-2018T02:42:20,SageSaga,i have a horror story about blood being taken too!
14-12-2018T02:42:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Or at least a hell of a lot better
14-12-2018T02:42:25,SpazztasticKiwi,NO
14-12-2018T02:42:29,Bgrmystr2,"I told her to use the small needle, not the big needle, I don't care if it takes longer"
14-12-2018T02:42:30,RimaDraws,o.o
14-12-2018T02:42:33,Bgrmystr2,and immediate blood.
14-12-2018T02:42:34,Bgrmystr2,>.>
14-12-2018T02:42:43,Ordithus,"So, about a month ago I accidentally stabbed myself in the hand, with my knife"
14-12-2018T02:42:45,Dadrobit,"And just as I type that, the pointy bit gets added."
14-12-2018T02:42:49,Bgrmystr2,"like.. big surprise, it's like I've had blood taken before."
14-12-2018T02:42:51,Ordithus,Needles?  Eh.
14-12-2018T02:43:07,SageSaga,my worse story about blood being taken was one time it took the nurse 8 tries to get a vessel
14-12-2018T02:43:17,Ordithus,I can relate!
14-12-2018T02:43:24,RimaDraws,oh shit sage
14-12-2018T02:43:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’m likely getting a filling done this visit. As long as I don’t feel the needle, I’ll be good"
14-12-2018T02:43:41,SageSaga,but my friend- he had a doctor that shoved it in- dug around a bit- made it pop out through the skin again while it was still in him- and then he just pushed the end back in
14-12-2018T02:43:50,Bgrmystr2,"mine only took three tries, but that was cuz I told her to use the little needle. :/"
14-12-2018T02:43:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Even better if I don’t feel it
14-12-2018T02:43:53,RimaDraws,owww
14-12-2018T02:43:56,Bgrmystr2,and jesus fuck sage why
14-12-2018T02:43:59,SageSaga,he basically stitched him with a needle
14-12-2018T02:44:04,SpazztasticKiwi,But that’s in a nutshell why I’m going to the dentist I am
14-12-2018T02:44:05,Ordithus,wtf
14-12-2018T02:44:11,Dadrobit,"Taking a couple of attempts sucks. Can relate. Also had one stick me and then just try to swivel it around a bit fishing for a vein, that was sucked nuts."

14-12-2018T15:36:12,ZRO4825,"How is that a risk, per se?"
14-12-2018T15:36:22,Hg17Lamont2002,What I was thinking?
14-12-2018T15:36:48,Hg17Lamont2002,That’s what I was thinking...
14-12-2018T15:37:33,SageSaga,well would you be worried about buying a 700 dollar video card for 80 bucks?
14-12-2018T15:37:41,MrMongMong,Yes.
14-12-2018T15:37:44,Hg17Lamont2002,Yes

14-12-2018T15:37:53,SageSaga,XD
14-12-2018T15:38:02,KiTA,Did you win an ebay auction or something?
14-12-2018T15:38:10,Hg17Lamont2002,Xd did u buy it from an unknown source
14-12-2018T15:38:11,SageSaga,buy it now option
14-12-2018T15:38:13,MrMongMong,I guess it would be a good idea to see what it has on it.
14-12-2018T15:38:17,SageSaga,ebay
14-12-2018T15:38:20,KiTA,I see it
14-12-2018T15:38:22,KiTA,buying it myseelf
14-12-2018T15:38:28,MrMongMong,Check the prices with the lower level ones.
14-12-2018T15:38:33,Hg17Lamont2002,Ehhh I don’t trust eBay lol
14-12-2018T15:38:33,sunblaze,wierd did he forget an 0?
14-12-2018T15:38:46,SageSaga,they have a money back guarantee if it's not what was advertised
14-12-2018T15:39:30,Hg17Lamont2002,Forgot they do that now
14-12-2018T15:39:53,MrMongMong,Buy it all!
14-12-2018T15:40:42,Hg17Lamont2002,Btw both Yours and Twokinds comics are looking great keep up the good work

14-12-2018T15:41:31,Twokinds,THANK YOU!
14-12-2018T15:41:48,Hg17Lamont2002,👍🏼
14-12-2018T15:42:47,ZRO4825,I think I see the listing you're talking about....debating if I should buy one or two myself...
14-12-2018T15:42:57,MrMongMong,feels touched seeing the heartwarming exchange between a kind fan and the creators.
14-12-2018T15:43:08,MrMongMong,BUY THEM ALL!
14-12-2018T15:43:10,Bgrmystr2,sounds hella scam to me lol
14-12-2018T15:43:16,MrMongMong,"Eh, money back"
14-12-2018T15:43:25,KiTA,I just asked in the BuildAPc reddit
14-12-2018T15:43:28,SageSaga,yeah i know Bgr
14-12-2018T15:43:39,KiTA,they said it's likely a scam due to the user information
14-12-2018T15:43:41,Hg17Lamont2002,Well guess you’ll see when it arrives
14-12-2018T15:43:51,SageSaga,but it does say the card- it shows the card- if it's fake then i should be able to get my money back
14-12-2018T15:44:01,Hg17Lamont2002,^
14-12-2018T15:44:21,ZRO4825,It does also say it's refurbished.
14-12-2018T15:44:34,MrMongMong,Sketchy. That's really sketchy.
14-12-2018T15:44:36,Hg17Lamont2002,Hmm that could explain
14-12-2018T15:44:44,Hg17Lamont2002,But still really cheap lol
14-12-2018T15:44:46,KiTA,the description is what gets me
14-12-2018T15:44:52,KiTA,it's copied from the summary of another listing
14-12-2018T15:44:55,MrMongMong,Maybe they simply bought a bunch of the wrong card.
14-12-2018T15:45:17,Hg17Lamont2002,That’s a lot of mine gone if that’s the case lol
14-12-2018T15:45:27,Hg17Lamont2002,Money*
14-12-2018T15:45:27,Bgrmystr2,it might actually be someone selling off their cards they used for mining
14-12-2018T15:45:28,ShadowSoap,Hello everyone!
14-12-2018T15:45:29,ZRO4825,"They're refurbished. Returns. They already got money out of'em once, lol"
14-12-2018T15:45:37,MrMongMong,That makes sense actually.
14-12-2018T15:45:49,MrMongMong,Hello Soap of Shadow.
14-12-2018T15:45:54,Hg17Lamont2002,Afternoon to ya soap
14-12-2018T15:46:08,Bgrmystr2,that's what I'd have to guess. It's mining cards that someone's selling off.
14-12-2018T15:46:21,Hg17Lamont2002,Possibly
14-12-2018T15:46:23,SageSaga,yeah im assuming mining card
14-12-2018T15:46:28,KiTA,They almost definitely forgot the 0
14-12-2018T15:46:38,SageSaga,either way- so long as it still works it would be good
14-12-2018T15:46:43,KiTA,The card goes for ~850 on Amazon
14-12-2018T15:46:45,Hg17Lamont2002,For sure
14-12-2018T15:46:56,KiTA,"But yeah, BuildAPC discord says it's almost definitely a scam"
14-12-2018T15:47:01,KiTA,they think the ebay account was hacked
14-12-2018T15:47:09,ZRO4825,"Well, if they fucked up, they just sold 20 vid cards for scrap pricing, lol"
14-12-2018T15:47:23,KiTA,"No, they just stole $76 x 20 bucks from people who wanted a deal"
14-12-2018T15:47:38,KiTA,If it's a scam they aren't sending anything
14-12-2018T15:47:57,MrMongMong,"#Lawsuits,LawsuitsEverywhere"
14-12-2018T15:48:09,Hg17Lamont2002,#lawsuits
14-12-2018T15:48:34,Bgrmystr2,that's not the only card selling for that price though
14-12-2018T15:48:34,MrMongMong,You get a lawsuit! And you get a lawsuit! Everyone gets a lawsuit!
14-12-2018T15:48:41,KiTA,what
14-12-2018T15:48:43,KiTA,Oh god
14-12-2018T15:48:46,Hg17Lamont2002,Exactly Xd
14-12-2018T15:48:49,MrMongMong,Maybe there's a company going out of business.
14-12-2018T15:48:50,ShadowSoap,That's America for ya. You can sue anyone for anything
14-12-2018T15:48:50,KiTA,if there are others selling for that price it's DEFINITELY a scam
14-12-2018T15:48:50,TerraTheWizard,":ctwokinds-floraquestion: ""why would law need to wear a suit"""
14-12-2018T15:48:58,ShadowSoap,Doesn't mean you'll win. But you can
14-12-2018T15:49:03,MrMongMong,Because this is America.
14-12-2018T15:49:15,Hg17Lamont2002,:ptv-right:
14-12-2018T15:49:21,SageSaga,but what is the scam?
14-12-2018T15:49:56,KiTA,"They don't actually have the card, Sage"
14-12-2018T15:49:59,Bgrmystr2,"well that's the whole point, Soap. Our legal system is set up to allow people to hold others responsible for shit they caused."
14-12-2018T15:50:06,Bgrmystr2,"Not that it always works, but"
14-12-2018T15:50:11,KiTA,"They stole someone's ebay account, created a fake listing, are goign to pocket the money and let Paypal figure it out"
14-12-2018T15:50:11,Bgrmystr2,that was the idea.
14-12-2018T15:50:11,increaz,Im glad that i got an email ...  otherwise i wouldnt have known
14-12-2018T15:50:36,ShadowSoap,Yup. God Bless America
14-12-2018T15:50:36,SageSaga,yeah so the one being scammed is ebay/paypal in the end right?
14-12-2018T15:50:40,KiTA,I mean I bought one too just in case it's a mislisted price
14-12-2018T15:50:49,MrMongMong,And the original seller?
14-12-2018T15:50:50,KiTA,but a card that's ~90% off?
14-12-2018T15:51:04,SageSaga,i know- it seems impossible
14-12-2018T15:51:12,KiTA,"The original seller is probably some guy in Russia or China, beyond the reach of Paypal"
14-12-2018T15:51:14,SageSaga,fingers crossed and all that
14-12-2018T15:51:16,KiTA,yeah
14-12-2018T15:51:22,MrMongMong,Maybe we should mention it to the site.
14-12-2018T15:51:33,Hg17Lamont2002,Probably a good idea
14-12-2018T15:51:38,Bgrmystr2,"probably, Mong, though likely someone already has"
14-12-2018T15:51:44,KiTA,Paypal forced me to use my bank account transfer for funds instead of credit card
14-12-2018T15:51:59,ZRO4825,"Here's to hoping, but it's also a previously used card. THAT part worries me more than the price, tbh, lol"
14-12-2018T15:52:16,ZRO4825,"I personally have a HUGE distrust of previously owned PC parts, lol"
14-12-2018T15:52:25,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all.
14-12-2018T15:52:33,TerraTheWizard,hey dadro
14-12-2018T15:52:37,ZRO4825,Heyyo Dadro
14-12-2018T15:52:40,Bgrmystr2,"the price worries me more than any generic used card. Of course used hardware is sketchy, but pricing like that is almost always a scam."
14-12-2018T15:52:40,Hg17Lamont2002,I’d agree Zro
14-12-2018T15:52:49,ShadowSoap,"Howdy Ho, Robit"
14-12-2018T15:52:52,Bgrmystr2,"while 90% of the time, used hardware is not actually a scam."
14-12-2018T15:53:12,Dadrobit,"And, no. PayPal isn't the one getting shafted, it's Ebay that's getting the short end."
14-12-2018T15:53:17,Twokinds,Heyo
14-12-2018T15:53:18,Hg17Lamont2002,Spotlights on rocky Gottem
14-12-2018T15:53:30,ZRO4825,"I don't mean that it's a scam, necessarily just cuz used hardware. I just distrust used hardware in general, cuz hell only knows how the last person treated it, lol"
14-12-2018T15:53:45,Dadrobit,"Ebay buyer protection means that even if the scammer can't be targeted, Ebay will still reimburse you."
14-12-2018T15:53:47,KiTA,"well, the BuildAPC guys are divided on Miner cards"
14-12-2018T15:53:54,KiTA,Most think they are fine
14-12-2018T15:54:13,MrMongMong,https://imgflip.com/i/2p2arj
14-12-2018T15:54:32,Hg17Lamont2002,The statue definitely is our main focus on this comic page
14-12-2018T15:55:07,Bgrmystr2,funny how there's more than one 1080ti GPU going for around the same price on ebay
14-12-2018T15:55:11,MrMongMong,Maybe it's a dragon who converted to Noraism and turned itself into stone to show its devotion.
14-12-2018T15:55:20,SageSaga,Only post links if you have permission first please
14-12-2018T15:55:22,KiTA,Bgrmystr2:  I don't see those at all
14-12-2018T15:55:37,MrMongMong,Oh.
14-12-2018T15:55:37,Dadrobit,"AFAIK, don't miners usually take really good care of their cards and not OC them to hell and back to ensure that they run as flawlessly as possible?"
14-12-2018T15:55:53,KiTA,"Dadrobit:  yes, that's why BuildAPC doesn't mind them"
14-12-2018T15:55:56,KiTA,"Well, some don't"
14-12-2018T15:56:00,KiTA,others think they run 24x7 so they cook
14-12-2018T15:56:01,BadFoMo,Back

14-12-2018T15:56:08,MrMongMong,"Sorry. I didn't know. It's just a ""is this a butterfly"" meme for this situation. Sorry."
14-12-2018T15:56:16,SageSaga,yes however they also run them all close together in groups so heat is an issue
14-12-2018T15:56:28,ShadowSoap,WB FoMO
14-12-2018T15:56:29,Bgrmystr2,"it's in the rule list, Mong lol"

14-12-2018T15:56:46,Bgrmystr2,under the stream
14-12-2018T15:57:01,BadFoMo,On Sage's side of the Stream.
14-12-2018T15:57:09,MrMongMong,Oh. I was on Tom's. Sorry?
14-12-2018T15:57:12,MrMongMong,Sorry.
14-12-2018T15:57:17,MrMongMong,Wrong punctuation.
14-12-2018T15:57:25,Bgrmystr2,"Sage is the one that hosts the multistreams, so his rules apply"
14-12-2018T15:57:41,Hg17Lamont2002,Makes sense

14-12-2018T15:58:28,KiTA,"Sage:  when you checked out via PayPal, did it refuse to let yo use a credit card?"
14-12-2018T15:58:34,ZRO4825,"Well, I mean, currently, yeah, he kinda is. :P"
14-12-2018T15:58:40,KiTA,"Because mine required the money be direct transferred from my bank to paypal, which is...  odd"
14-12-2018T15:58:52,Hg17Lamont2002,I don’t trust that
14-12-2018T15:58:52,microbuss,nm Got my toys in the mail & sended 2 packages of 3 toys in mail

14-12-2018T15:59:39,Dadrobit,"Hm, indeed. And especially a 1080ti for that cheap is turbo-sketch. But hey, maybe it's not and you just got heckin' lucky."
14-12-2018T16:00:02,Bgrmystr2,it's still sketchy even if it's legit.
14-12-2018T16:00:02,MviluUatusun,Good Saturday everybody.  How's it going?
14-12-2018T16:00:06,Dadrobit,"Worst case, you'll get your money back from Ebay."

14-12-2018T16:08:15,ShadowSoap,I've never had eggnog. Never really wanted to.
14-12-2018T16:08:34,Dadrobit,"Beck, Hear Hear!"
14-12-2018T16:09:03,MrMongMong,"I've tasted it once, it was nice, maybe not something I would drink often though. Maybe once a year?"
14-12-2018T16:09:26,Hg17Lamont2002,And that time of year would be probably the holiday season
14-12-2018T16:09:33,TheBeckoner,Its the good juice. Maybe I can make it...

14-12-2018T16:13:01,Dadrobit,"Plus, eggnog is coked, so that's a thing."

14-12-2018T16:22:31,Dadrobit,"Not to get on topic or anything, but place your bets. Is that a Bipedal Nora statue there? I know Tom doesn't do ""real"" versions of her in sketches because it's a spoiler for the story, so is this the reveal?"

14-12-2018T16:31:54,CrRAR,"That, and their instruments they invest in."

14-12-2018T16:32:05,Bgrmystr2,hey w0lf
14-12-2018T16:32:07,ShadowSoap,Nice to see ya!
14-12-2018T16:32:09,CrRAR,hey w0lf!
14-12-2018T16:32:17,w0lfmare,Hello hello o/
14-12-2018T16:32:33,KiTA,Sage:  All of those similar video card listings to the one we bought that were for $99 were removed from eBay
14-12-2018T16:33:28,Corinthian,Hiya W0lf.
14-12-2018T16:34:07,ShadowSoap,@Corinthian I like your profile pic.
14-12-2018T16:34:14,Corinthian,Thank you
14-12-2018T16:34:21,steelabjur,No thumb! That's what's bugging me about that hand!
14-12-2018T16:34:37,Hg17Lamont2002,I can’t see it cause I’m on mobile Pic
14-12-2018T16:34:39,KiTA,"Hey Tom, what kinda content is Magical Mishaps going to be covering?"
14-12-2018T16:34:41,SageSaga,any idea how soon we will know if it was a scam?
14-12-2018T16:34:47,KiTA,Same thing as the old Pixie Panic type one off?
14-12-2018T16:34:57,KiTA,Sage:  No idea.
14-12-2018T16:35:06,KiTA,"Sage:  If the listing vanishes, then ebay is taking action"
14-12-2018T16:35:10,Twokinds,I did explain it in the post
14-12-2018T16:35:35,KiTA,"If not, we might just have to wait till the card doesn't arrive, or arrives and isn't real, or doesn't work, or..."
14-12-2018T16:35:41,Dadrobit,Either A: It won't come or B: When it comes and you immediately test it on a closed test system you'll find that it is not a 1080ti.
14-12-2018T16:35:42,Azumachan,"Magical Mishaps will be an anthology of short stories, mostly themed around magic and its potential to go wrong."
14-12-2018T16:35:43,Aphala,Could be miner cards
14-12-2018T16:35:48,Aphala,Slinging the old stock
14-12-2018T16:35:51,KiTA,They're almost definitely miner cards
14-12-2018T16:36:01,Aphala,Nvidia or AMD?
14-12-2018T16:36:04,KiTA,"but even then, that's $500 less than miner 1080TI Blacks are going for"
14-12-2018T16:36:18,KiTA,11G-P4-6393-KR by EVGA
14-12-2018T16:36:25,KiTA,EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti SC Black Edition Gaming
14-12-2018T16:36:45,KiTA,It's an INSANE deal and with ebay buyer protectoin I don't mind rolling the dice in case they were miss-priced
14-12-2018T16:36:52,Twokinds,Don't use it! You'll get the black lung!
14-12-2018T16:36:53,Aphala,I have that exact card
14-12-2018T16:36:54,SageSaga,yeah
14-12-2018T16:37:08,Aphala,Got it for £650 brand new
14-12-2018T16:37:40,Twokinds,I will buy a new graphics card as soon as they stop being the same price they were 4 years ago
14-12-2018T16:37:48,Dadrobit,lol
14-12-2018T16:37:54,KiTA,"Yeah, they're selling for £60 right now"
14-12-2018T16:38:01,KiTA,"at least, according to that fishy ebay listing haha"
14-12-2018T16:38:08,Aphala,Companies used the miner crisis to just use the high rates as a base rate
14-12-2018T16:38:19,KiTA,Here's what maybe happened
14-12-2018T16:38:25,KiTA,There were a BUNCH of those cards posted today at $99
14-12-2018T16:38:41,microbuss,erf *flops onto the floor* :zzz: x.x
14-12-2018T16:38:48,Twokinds,I miss the days when graphics card tech was advancing every year
14-12-2018T16:38:59,KiTA,76.89 is exactly 20% under that.
14-12-2018T16:39:01,CrRAR,yeah
14-12-2018T16:39:10,Aphala,The only thing that's been any good is the high VRAM and the Ray tracing
14-12-2018T16:39:18,Aphala,RTX cards look lovely on single player games
14-12-2018T16:39:22,KiTA,"So if someone was using a prrogram to post that listing, and they just did 20% undercut like a bad WOW or EVE Online Daytrader"
14-12-2018T16:39:26,Aphala,But you'd never notice it on multiplayer
14-12-2018T16:39:35,steelabjur,"I guess I could come up with $1 a month for more TK content, contribute toward Tom's retirement fund, I already paid $12 for a year of Hulu..."
14-12-2018T16:39:40,TheBeckoner,Hey thank y'all for streaming. Im gonna go get some sleep. see yah
14-12-2018T16:39:48,Aphala,Laters
14-12-2018T16:39:53,Combak,Bye Beck!
14-12-2018T16:39:56,Dadrobit,Ebay = Jita confirmed.
14-12-2018T16:40:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,see ta becku
14-12-2018T16:40:04,Dadrobit,o/ Beck
14-12-2018T16:40:06,ShadowSoap,GN Beck. Sleep well!
14-12-2018T16:40:07,CrRAR,"computation has stepped up crazy lately, yeah lighting will be the next big noticeable change in game technology."
14-12-2018T16:40:33,SageSaga,a 1080ti though is still crazy good
14-12-2018T16:40:38,Aphala,If you're going to upgrade cards do it on a 5 / 6 year turn
14-12-2018T16:40:41,CrRAR,yup
14-12-2018T16:40:43,Hg17Lamont2002,One of the top Carfs
14-12-2018T16:40:49,Hg17Lamont2002,Cards*
14-12-2018T16:40:54,KiTA,I bought my GTX 970 and that's my problem
14-12-2018T16:40:55,Aphala,I don't understand people who immediately jump on a generation
14-12-2018T16:40:58,KiTA,There's NOTHING to upgrade to
14-12-2018T16:41:12,Dadrobit,brb again.
14-12-2018T16:41:14,KiTA,The AMD 590 is ok but not $400 of added benefits
14-12-2018T16:41:14,SageSaga,isnt the 1070ti better?
14-12-2018T16:41:16,Aphala,Give it two gens
14-12-2018T16:41:21,KiTA,"980 is retired, 1080 is next up"
14-12-2018T16:41:25,Twokinds,"Same, I've got the 970"
14-12-2018T16:41:32,Twokinds,pointless to upgrade
14-12-2018T16:41:39,KiTA,"I think the 1070ti is better than the 970, but 1070tis are ~$400 thanks to buttcoin"
14-12-2018T16:41:41,CrRAR,"yeah, still solid"
14-12-2018T16:41:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,love the 970 tbh
14-12-2018T16:41:55,steelabjur,"I bought a 1080ti a few years ago when I built this computer, have had zero problems with it."
14-12-2018T16:42:04,Aphala,I went from a Fury X to a 1080 then to a ti
14-12-2018T16:42:07,Aphala,My god the difference
14-12-2018T16:42:32,Aphala,(Sold my old 1080 to a friend hence the bump up to the ti)
14-12-2018T16:42:48,CrRAR,I did love ATI back in the day but nVidia has been killing it for at least 10 years.
14-12-2018T16:42:59,KiTA,one thing is that if this is a real 1080Ti Black 11GB supercard deal
14-12-2018T16:43:06,Aphala,The only thing about Nvidia is they clearly don't need to price the cards that high
14-12-2018T16:43:07,KiTA,I'm gonna have to buy a displayport to DVI adapter
14-12-2018T16:43:18,Aphala,It's just extra money
14-12-2018T16:43:20,KiTA,yeah they're blatantly abusing the market thanks to buttcoin :P
14-12-2018T16:43:23,microbuss,my Win 7 has nvidia in it
14-12-2018T16:43:31,Aphala,All about that Nvidiabucks
14-12-2018T16:43:58,KiTA,"It's my understanding that TomsHardware isn't 100% trusted anymore (they apparently didn't even review the new Nvidia cards, they just said to shut up and buy them)"
14-12-2018T16:44:07,KiTA,but
14-12-2018T16:44:21,KiTA,"My GTX 970 is a tier 5 card no, alongside basically everything not a R9 Fury or above"
14-12-2018T16:44:28,KiTA,"980 is a Tier 4, alongside R9 Fury"
14-12-2018T16:44:31,KiTA,but a 980 is $400
14-12-2018T16:44:37,KiTA,and it's not $400 worth of additional use
14-12-2018T16:44:49,Aphala,Can't wait for Knight Landing
14-12-2018T16:44:51,Aphala,.... s/
14-12-2018T16:44:55,Aphala,ooft
14-12-2018T16:45:01,KiTA,"1070/1070Ti is tier 3, but $500.  Alongside R9 Fury X and Vega 56"
14-12-2018T16:45:21,KiTA,"1080Ti is a Tier 2, and $850 according to Toms Hardware"
14-12-2018T16:45:29,KiTA,the Tier 1 cards are the 2080s
14-12-2018T16:45:51,SageSaga,except the 2080 is garbage value
14-12-2018T16:45:57,Aphala,It is
14-12-2018T16:45:58,Aphala,:/
14-12-2018T16:46:13,Aphala,XX80 cards are always in a precarious place
14-12-2018T16:46:22,Aphala,Cut ram / cuda
14-12-2018T16:46:32,Aphala,But not enough to make it a XX70
14-12-2018T16:46:40,SageSaga,the 2070 isnt bad
14-12-2018T16:46:57,SageSaga,the price is a little high but it has good performance- the 1080ti though still beats it
14-12-2018T16:47:13,KiTA,"yeah, the BuildAPC guy I was talking to said that if the ebay thing is a scam (he thinks it is) then he linked a few 2070s for reasonable prices on ebay"
14-12-2018T16:47:33,KiTA,"but yeah, if it was exactly 20% under the $99s"
14-12-2018T16:47:39,Aphala,Wake me up when we've got some Ready Player One stuff going on
14-12-2018T16:47:50,KiTA,"well, that suggests some form of software posting the listing"
14-12-2018T16:47:50,Aphala,:pensive:
14-12-2018T16:48:02,KiTA,oh yeah
14-12-2018T16:48:07,Issus,AI will probably take over first.
14-12-2018T16:48:07,KiTA,if we can just survive till 2050 or so
14-12-2018T16:48:12,KiTA,we're aimin' for some really neato stuff
14-12-2018T16:48:14,Aphala,Mate I'll be 70
14-12-2018T16:48:15,Aphala,I'm good
14-12-2018T16:48:18,Aphala,I hope
14-12-2018T16:48:21,KiTA,I'll be uh
14-12-2018T16:48:25,Aphala,I can officially return at 70
14-12-2018T16:48:33,Aphala,:skull:
14-12-2018T16:48:34,KiTA,69
14-12-2018T16:48:37,Aphala,Nice
14-12-2018T16:48:40,Aphala,:joy:
14-12-2018T16:48:40,KiTA,giggity
14-12-2018T16:48:49,MisterWho,return or retire? ;)
14-12-2018T16:48:56,Aphala,Redie-er
14-12-2018T16:49:05,MisterWho,"ohhh, zombie modus!"
14-12-2018T16:49:12,CrRAR,"the gfx market development is in purgatory right now, the stuff they’re coming out with is building toward the raytracing capability... but not there yet, or even remotely affordable yet."
14-12-2018T16:49:13,Aphala,They'll just pump us full of NANO MACHINES SON!
14-12-2018T16:49:29,KiTA,yeah but who cares about raytracing?
14-12-2018T16:49:33,KiTA,That's the dirty little secret
14-12-2018T16:49:38,KiTA,we're AT the top of the plateau
14-12-2018T16:49:38,MisterWho,"Resistance is futile you will be ""borged""."
14-12-2018T16:49:42,Twokinds,DONE
14-12-2018T16:49:44,Bgrmystr2,the fact that they got raytracing working with so little catered towards that part of the card..
14-12-2018T16:49:45,Mandag,"You can't hurt me, Jack!"
14-12-2018T16:49:48,Bgrmystr2,is still impressive
14-12-2018T16:49:48,BadFoMo,Cool.
14-12-2018T16:49:52,ShadowSoap,Hurrah!
14-12-2018T16:49:55,CrRAR,no one cuz it’s not even in the mainstream yet.
14-12-2018T16:49:59,KiTA,The second consumer health nanomachines are a thing I'm going for it
14-12-2018T16:50:01,Azumachan,Neat.
14-12-2018T16:50:01,Issus,"Raytracing is helpful in a few specific tests, but we're FAR from being able to raytrace a full scene at a reasonable speed."
14-12-2018T16:50:03,Aphala,Good ol' MG
14-12-2018T16:50:03,microbuss,Nano Machines? I prefer Micro Machines! :P
14-12-2018T16:50:04,Bgrmystr2,"this is nice, tom"
14-12-2018T16:50:05,MisterWho,i wounder what it's about that statue...
14-12-2018T16:50:08,Mandag,That statue locks pretty slick
14-12-2018T16:50:11,Aphala,Nano butts
14-12-2018T16:50:12,Dimensional,"Madi looks back, then back at the arched door. ""Uh... Which way did we come in?"""
14-12-2018T16:50:16,KiTA,"Raymond Kurzweil is right, screw biology, I wanna live forever in my private moon fortress"
14-12-2018T16:50:18,ShadowSoap,Look at that statue!
14-12-2018T16:50:27,ShadowSoap,It looks sick as fuck.
14-12-2018T16:50:38,CrRAR,"yeah bgr, it takes just crazy massive general computation abilities."
14-12-2018T16:50:41,KiTA,Statue is a new character
14-12-2018T16:50:41,Bgrmystr2,yeah the statue is awesome
14-12-2018T16:50:42,Mandag,It has a nice butt
14-12-2018T16:50:46,MisterWho,it does not move.....still :D
14-12-2018T16:50:47,KiTA,Smexy obsidian Dragon nudist
14-12-2018T16:50:57,MisterWho,no tiger butt!
14-12-2018T16:50:59,KiTA,"thinks Red, Scythe and Maddie are cute"
14-12-2018T16:51:08,Twokinds,Shoot forgot to apply raytracing
14-12-2018T16:51:09,Bgrmystr2,I think the fact that the card is actually raytracing straight up is the most impressive thing to me
14-12-2018T16:51:09,KiTA,Everyone's too terrified to tell him to put pants on
14-12-2018T16:51:15,CrRAR,haha
14-12-2018T16:51:15,microbuss,obsidian? naah Obscene yes XD
14-12-2018T16:51:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"no, mah rtx"
14-12-2018T16:51:29,KiTA,"Trace tries, but the girls physically restrain him"
14-12-2018T16:51:34,Issus,"Well, we've had raytracing for decades. We just didn't have hardware designed to do it very well."
14-12-2018T16:51:39,Bgrmystr2,since raytracing in general is way more intensive than the alternative
14-12-2018T16:51:42,KiTA,He ends up staying at the mansion as Rose's butler
14-12-2018T16:51:45,Issus,RTX is a step in that direction just... it's too costly even with shortcuts.
14-12-2018T16:51:49,KiTA,Still won't wear clothes
14-12-2018T16:51:50,MisterWho,any news about the new registered VEGA 10 and VEGA 20 numbers in the linux drivers?
14-12-2018T16:52:09,BadFoMo,No raytracing?! Letrly unplayable!
14-12-2018T16:52:34,MisterWho,But that raytracing starwars video was cool - if it was really in realtime
14-12-2018T16:52:35,KiTA,"""Is that a big naked black dragonman doing the hedges?""  ""Yes.""  ""... gonna tell him to put some pants on?""  ""... No.""  ""... Good job."""
14-12-2018T16:52:43,CrRAR,haha
14-12-2018T16:52:54,Issus,"It was in realtime, but IIRC it was 4x, 2000$ video cards doing it at about 30fps?"
14-12-2018T16:53:03,BadFoMo,...What is raytracing anyway?
14-12-2018T16:53:29,Aphala,Beautiful stuff
14-12-2018T16:53:30,Bgrmystr2,"Fomo, there's plenty of resources online that can explain raytracing"
14-12-2018T16:53:35,Aphala,Just costly performance
14-12-2018T16:53:35,CrRAR,*lizardman awakens threatingly* Rose shows up an tickles him into submission with featherduster.
14-12-2018T16:53:43,BadFoMo,I'm too laze to look.
14-12-2018T16:53:45,CrRAR,Day. SAVED.
14-12-2018T16:53:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
14-12-2018T16:53:48,Bgrmystr2,then why would we tell you?
14-12-2018T16:53:57,Bgrmystr2,if you're too lazy to do it yourself
14-12-2018T16:54:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Rose the hero this city deserves
14-12-2018T16:54:07,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-rose:
14-12-2018T16:54:13,KiTA,"Torn between him knowing full well he's putting on a show for everyone and amused by them, and just being completely and utterly oblivious to the idea"
14-12-2018T16:54:14,BadFoMo,"Because you know. ...You do know, right?"
14-12-2018T16:54:18,Issus,"It's a bit more complicated than we could explain here, BadMoFo."
14-12-2018T16:54:23,Bgrmystr2,"I do know, yes."
14-12-2018T16:54:26,KiTA,Both are amusing for different reasons
14-12-2018T16:54:30,Twokinds,Okay now done
14-12-2018T16:54:35,BadFoMo,Oh...
14-12-2018T16:54:36,Issus,Never done. D8

14-12-2018T16:54:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Awesome work Tom
14-12-2018T16:54:49,CrRAR,great success
14-12-2018T16:55:47,Dimensional,Stone Lizard tail.
14-12-2018T16:56:33,microbuss,yeah loving it
14-12-2018T16:56:49,KiTA,"On the one, the idea of a big scaley naked lizardman loving to tease everyone around him is amusing -- I'm thinking how the buff goblin in Reincarnated as a Slime is ALWAYS flexing"
14-12-2018T16:56:53,VorishSnivy7,So this is really the twokinds comic?
14-12-2018T16:57:02,Bgrmystr2,well yeah

14-12-2018T16:57:25,KiTA,"On the other, the idea of a completely oblivious smexy slab of lizard tail causing everyone around him to swoon and COMPLETELY not knowing anything about it is amusing too"
14-12-2018T16:57:29,Aphala,You're not being bamboozled my friend
14-12-2018T16:57:40,Hg17Lamont2002,We got rocky over here chilling with us too

14-12-2018T16:59:11,BadFoMo,Inb4 Tom: My comic pages are never finished; they're just abandoned.
14-12-2018T16:59:27,Bgrmystr2,he abandons them and then posts them on the site.
14-12-2018T16:59:36,Issus,That's how art works.
14-12-2018T16:59:43,Issus,"You never finish, you just give up."

14-12-2018T17:02:34,Dimensional,It makes me wonder what the lizard statue is. Looks like a human-dragon hybrid.
14-12-2018T17:02:36,Sammit,Thanks for the stream Tom
14-12-2018T17:02:36,Hg17Lamont2002,Well it was definitely a fun journey today

14-12-2018T17:09:35,SageSaga,when ya look back at the previous comic and realize- you painted the barely visible boards on the inside at an angle and not straight-
14-12-2018T17:11:19,Bgrmystr2,rip
14-12-2018T17:13:06,Twokinds,Hey wait a minute

14-12-2018T17:14:01,sunblaze,congratz sage you did it!I actually feel a bit sorry for the bandits and the whooping they will get :D
14-12-2018T17:14:19,sunblaze,bye tom
14-12-2018T17:14:20,Twokinds,The bandits are coming!
14-12-2018T17:18:41,CrRAR,o:

14-12-2018T17:23:13,SageSaga,wat?
14-12-2018T17:23:45,BadFoMo,Who's thumb?
14-12-2018T17:24:21,Bgrmystr2,"the statue I presume, though reading the chat makes it obvious :P"
14-12-2018T17:24:47,MviluUatusun,"Well, darn it.  I missed Tom's stream because I was busy elsewhere."
14-12-2018T17:25:03,BadFoMo,Sorry.
14-12-2018T17:25:15,SageSaga,"well darn it, im not good enough for you"
14-12-2018T17:25:19,Bgrmystr2,yeah it happens Mvilu
14-12-2018T17:25:26,Bgrmystr2,noone's good enough
14-12-2018T17:25:31,Bgrmystr2,nobody
14-12-2018T17:25:39,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-SteelwormHades:
14-12-2018T17:26:30,MviluUatusun,"Least of all me, Bgr."
14-12-2018T17:26:50,MviluUatusun,I'm still here Sage.  I just missed Tom's stream.
14-12-2018T17:27:49,MviluUatusun,"I had to have a conversation with Amazon about an order that I haven't received yet.  As a result, I missed the stream."
14-12-2018T17:29:28,Hg17Lamont2002,So how has everybody’s day been so far
14-12-2018T17:30:56,MviluUatusun,"Except for my mother falling this morning, my day's been quite well so far, Hg17."
14-12-2018T17:31:43,Hg17Lamont2002,That’s good to hear not the mom thing but the day thing lol
14-12-2018T17:32:01,Hg17Lamont2002,She ok?
14-12-2018T17:32:16,MviluUatusun,"Well, my mom's fine.  She just scrapped her arm and I've had to doctor it."
14-12-2018T17:33:22,Hg17Lamont2002,Ah well that’s good that she is doing alright
14-12-2018T17:34:01,MviluUatusun,"Yeah.  She's a bit depressed for being a ""burden"" on me.  But, she's my mom and she took care of me when I couldn't do it.  I'm just repaying a debt."
14-12-2018T17:35:16,Hg17Lamont2002,Exactly
14-12-2018T17:38:03,MviluUatusun,BBS.
14-12-2018T17:38:28,Hg17Lamont2002,K
14-12-2018T17:43:39,KiTA,Sage:  I'm starting to see other listing for 1080Tis that use the same description
14-12-2018T17:44:05,KiTA,"search for 1080ti, select sold on the left"
14-12-2018T17:45:44,sunblaze,why are they that cheap? is it some kind of ebaysale before christmas?
14-12-2018T17:45:53,KiTA,It's a bot
14-12-2018T17:45:59,KiTA,"it's a bot creating fake listings, I think"
14-12-2018T17:46:17,KiTA,"all of them have the same description, which is malformed"
14-12-2018T17:47:25,SageSaga,i dont see em
14-12-2018T17:48:00,KiTA,want me to link some?
14-12-2018T17:48:44,CrimsonQuill,Hullo Sage
14-12-2018T17:49:10,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, so this is what Nyna's going to be doing in the Tavern. I wondered."
14-12-2018T17:49:41,SageSaga,whisper it to me
14-12-2018T17:49:56,SageSaga,not a tavern Crim
14-12-2018T17:50:04,CrimsonQuill,"Well, aomeplace anyhow."
14-12-2018T17:50:45,KiTA,"Note that a HUGE number of those cards are getting posted all at once, and if you click on them the listing has been removed outright"
14-12-2018T17:51:58,SageSaga,has your payment been processed?
14-12-2018T17:52:05,KiTA,Not yet
14-12-2018T17:52:29,SageSaga,mine says it hasnt been accepted yet- which is kinda odd- i would think they would auto accept to get the money
14-12-2018T17:52:40,KiTA,Same
14-12-2018T17:53:49,BadFoMo,"Is it just me, or does ""Mr. Boal-Cut's"" right hand look messed up (glitched?)?"
14-12-2018T17:54:12,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, not just you, it does look strange to me as well"
14-12-2018T17:55:05,SageSaga,that fix it?
14-12-2018T17:56:50,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
14-12-2018T17:57:29,BadFoMo,It looks like it might be bent a little too far? Sorry for being nit-picky like this.
14-12-2018T17:57:59,Bgrmystr2,the fingers look like they're shaped for the hand being at a different angle
14-12-2018T17:58:00,SageSaga,i dont mind it
14-12-2018T17:58:08,BadFoMo,Thanks.
14-12-2018T18:07:42,BadFoMo,"So, inb4 Nyan finds out that /these/ bandits were protecting Owl-Bear babes?"
14-12-2018T18:08:12,Combak,I'm going to head out. Bye all!
14-12-2018T18:08:16,BadFoMo,Bye.
14-12-2018T18:08:46,Combak,"Oh, and thanks for streaming Sage!"
14-12-2018T18:08:46,FoxxTrotter,"C-ya, Combak."
14-12-2018T18:08:54,SageSaga,take care!
14-12-2018T18:09:01,Combak,"Bye Foxx, FoMo, Sage."
14-12-2018T18:41:46,Hg17Lamont2002,I’m back

14-12-2018T19:02:04,Twokinds,BLOOD!
14-12-2018T19:02:39,RimaDraws,EEP!
14-12-2018T19:02:58,THETOXICATOR,Hi
14-12-2018T19:05:57,BadFoMo,"Ho good, blood and gore is enabled. I was worried that Nyan was playing a cencered version."
14-12-2018T19:06:02,BadFoMo,*Oh
14-12-2018T19:07:19,Twokinds,Oh no
14-12-2018T19:07:41,CrimsonQuill,Hi Tom.
14-12-2018T19:07:55,CrimsonQuill,Hi everyone
14-12-2018T19:07:58,Twokinds,"I tried to save the comic as a high res png and accidentally set it to save as ""smallest possible"""
14-12-2018T19:08:05,CrimsonQuill,Oh crumbs!
14-12-2018T19:08:15,Twokinds,I managed to play an entire smash match and it still wasn't done.
14-12-2018T19:08:16,CrimsonQuill,Can you reverse it?
14-12-2018T19:08:21,FoxxTrotter,So smol... :0P
14-12-2018T19:08:43,Twokinds,"Wow, it didn't even do a good job"
14-12-2018T19:08:50,Twokinds,It's a 30MB image file
14-12-2018T19:09:02,CrimsonQuill,OH CRUMBS THAT'S BIG.
14-12-2018T19:10:09,Bgrmystr2,lolo
14-12-2018T19:11:10,Xexanoth,...how the hell did it end up at that size?
14-12-2018T19:11:28,CrimsonQuill,God knows.
14-12-2018T19:11:32,CrimsonQuill,Umm...
14-12-2018T19:12:15,CrimsonQuill,"CrimsonQuill realises that they're watching the final 3 episodes of an anime at 10 past midnight, like a fool."
14-12-2018T19:12:28,Xexanoth,seems pretty normal to me quill
14-12-2018T19:12:42,CrimsonQuill,The anime binge or file size?>
14-12-2018T19:12:47,Xexanoth,anime binge
14-12-2018T19:12:51,SageSaga,anime binge- i do it all the time
14-12-2018T19:13:02,CrimsonQuill,Because normally I limit myself to 2 episodes a day.
14-12-2018T19:13:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,me too
14-12-2018T19:13:10,CrimsonQuill,"But I missed a few, so I'm watching 6."
14-12-2018T19:13:27,Xexanoth,then again the last 2 episodes of most animes end up pretty bad if they're adaptations so i skip half of em anyways....
14-12-2018T19:13:27,CrimsonQuill,"My sister, when she binges, sometimes binges an ENTIRE series in a night."
14-12-2018T19:13:36,MrMongMong,"realizes that with the time provided by CrimsonQuill, he can find their location. But also realizes that it would be creepy to do, so decides against it."
14-12-2018T19:14:06,SageSaga,that's not creepy and that doesnt give you nearly enough information to locate them
14-12-2018T19:14:09,MrMongMong,"Also, that was me with twokinds."
14-12-2018T19:14:13,CrimsonQuill,@MrMongMong 'find my location'? Are you MI5 or the FBI or something?
14-12-2018T19:14:24,MrMongMong,I meant general location in the world.
14-12-2018T19:14:25,CrimsonQuill,"LOL, I'm joking"
14-12-2018T19:14:26,Bgrmystr2,yeah what sage said
14-12-2018T19:14:38,MrMongMong,"But, no one can know... *draws knife*"
14-12-2018T19:14:53,CrimsonQuill,@MrMongMong send in an SAS squad.
14-12-2018T19:14:59,CrimsonQuill,They're the best of the best.
14-12-2018T19:14:59,MrMongMong,Swatting is bad.
14-12-2018T19:15:07,CrimsonQuill,WHO DARES WINS.
14-12-2018T19:15:09,Twokinds,"Crimson drinks tea, so he must be on the British Isles"
14-12-2018T19:15:15,CrimsonQuill,Correct Tom.
14-12-2018T19:15:16,MrMongMong,That is true.
14-12-2018T19:15:23,CrimsonQuill,But that's all I'll say.
14-12-2018T19:15:34,CrimsonQuill,'British Isles' it is.
14-12-2018T19:16:00,Xexanoth,hmm we need more info: how good is the public transportation in your area?
14-12-2018T19:16:05,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, I've still got three episodes on my list..."
14-12-2018T19:16:20,CrimsonQuill,"God, I'll be here all night."
14-12-2018T19:16:22,Twokinds,How do you say the number 3
14-12-2018T19:16:23,MrMongMong,"Time for a quick google of your name, reverse image search your profile, and we should be there."
14-12-2018T19:16:28,CrimsonQuill,Three.
14-12-2018T19:16:32,Twokinds,...
14-12-2018T19:16:41,MrMongMong,I won't actually do that.
14-12-2018T19:16:43,Xexanoth,*better luck next time*
14-12-2018T19:16:44,CrimsonQuill,I know
14-12-2018T19:16:54,CrimsonQuill,"It's just a fun, silly joke"
14-12-2018T19:17:22,CrimsonQuill,"But I think, if it's too early in the morning to go to bed when the anime is done, I might try to finish Undertale."
14-12-2018T19:17:34,CrimsonQuill,I'm stuck-as in STUCK-on a boss.
14-12-2018T19:17:37,MrMongMong,Cutting your losses I see.
14-12-2018T19:17:41,CrimsonQuill,Yep
14-12-2018T19:17:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"play anime, watch undertail"
14-12-2018T19:18:04,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, all I know is that I am awful at dodging with Arrow Keys."
14-12-2018T19:18:08,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
14-12-2018T19:18:10,CrimsonQuill,But I will stay determined!
14-12-2018T19:18:20,CrimsonQuill,I've only died 300 times...
14-12-2018T19:18:28,Xexanoth,which boss you stuck on?
14-12-2018T19:18:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,gotta get those numbers up
14-12-2018T19:18:38,CrimsonQuill,A S G O R E
14-12-2018T19:18:43,Bgrmystr2,Quill would not survive gensokyo.
14-12-2018T19:18:44,Xexanoth,understandable
14-12-2018T19:18:45,CrimsonQuill,I know what I must do.
14-12-2018T19:18:46,MrMongMong,"Don't worry, you will probably be able to finish it before the year is up."
14-12-2018T19:18:49,CrimsonQuill,I will do it.
14-12-2018T19:18:57,CrimsonQuill,My sister only died to him 11 times
14-12-2018T19:19:04,CrimsonQuill,I've died at least 40 now.
14-12-2018T19:19:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,she is the chosen one
14-12-2018T19:19:28,MrMongMong,What is gensokyo?
14-12-2018T19:19:32,Xexanoth,my favourite part of undertale is that the easiest way to get the best ending is just to completely suck at the game
14-12-2018T19:19:39,CrimsonQuill,"Nah, that'd be Sean William McLoughlin (Jackspeticeye)"
14-12-2018T19:19:52,CrimsonQuill,I read that he beat ASGORE with no deaths.
14-12-2018T19:20:06,CrimsonQuill,"But since the videpo is a spoiler, I haven't watched it to verify."
14-12-2018T19:20:16,CrimsonQuill,All I know is that I have a bad feeling about this...
14-12-2018T19:20:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I can't take a name like ass gore seriously
14-12-2018T19:20:33,CrimsonQuill,Blind gaming is the way to go.
14-12-2018T19:20:40,Xexanoth,@MrMongMong gensokyo is from touhou aka this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZu2O_JQ4vs
14-12-2018T19:20:41,CrimsonQuill,"The music is awesome, though."
14-12-2018T19:20:51,MrMongMong,"In his younger years, Trace Legacy beat undertale by teleporting himself into the computer, and punching Asgore in the face."
14-12-2018T19:20:56,CrimsonQuill,"So heartbreaking, but so determined too."
14-12-2018T19:21:40,MrMongMong,"Thank you Xexanoth,"
14-12-2018T19:22:23,Xexanoth,then trace had more success with computers than eric did XD
14-12-2018T19:22:28,CrimsonQuill,"@MrMongMong However, Trace's breach of the walls of the multiverse, along with experiments with multiverse portals in Aperture Science, led to a duplicate of Raine Silverlock being drawn into the Haloverse, where she would become Spartan Raine."
14-12-2018T19:22:43,MrMongMong,"Eric failed because he was looking for one thing, and one thing only"
14-12-2018T19:22:48,Bgrmystr2,"@MrMongMong Gensokyo is the setting of Touhou, a shmup that people like to compare to undertale, though being fairly different, it's also much more difficult"
14-12-2018T19:22:55,MrMongMong,Thanks.
14-12-2018T19:23:03,CrimsonQuill,The anime i'm trying to finish is the Ancient Magus' Bride.
14-12-2018T19:23:13,Bgrmystr2,"just binge watch it, Quill"
14-12-2018T19:23:15,CrimsonQuill,"I've got three episodes left, and I need to see what happens."
14-12-2018T19:23:17,Bgrmystr2,problem solved
14-12-2018T19:23:26,Bgrmystr2,set aside a day and just watch the whole thing.
14-12-2018T19:23:39,CrimsonQuill,"But first, I'm staying in this chat, because an hour and a half straight needs a break."
14-12-2018T19:24:00,CrimsonQuill,And tomorrow...Differentiation and Integration study.
14-12-2018T19:24:20,MrMongMong,"Isn't it already ""tomorrow"" where you are?"
14-12-2018T19:24:32,MrMongMong,"As in, already past 12"
14-12-2018T19:24:51,NibblyBot,New Comic Page: Scales of Stone http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/1049/
14-12-2018T19:25:00,MrMongMong,Yes!
14-12-2018T19:25:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,thank you nibbly
14-12-2018T19:25:22,CrimsonQuill,"Technically, as Vitalstatistix the Chief says in Asterix, 'Tomorrow never comes'."
14-12-2018T19:25:25,CrimsonQuill,Thanks Nibs
14-12-2018T19:25:44,MrMongMong,Is Nibs a program? Or a very dedicated human.
14-12-2018T19:25:53,Bgrmystr2,it's a bot
14-12-2018T19:25:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Iliars bot
14-12-2018T19:26:01,MrMongMong,Ah.
14-12-2018T19:26:01,CrimsonQuill,But a very dedicated one.
14-12-2018T19:26:07,Bgrmystr2,..it's a bot
14-12-2018T19:26:14,Bgrmystr2,there's no dedication or lack thereof
14-12-2018T19:26:15,Twokinds,A hard working bot
14-12-2018T19:26:19,Bgrmystr2,it just does what it's programmed
14-12-2018T19:26:26,sunblaze,a bouncing bot!
14-12-2018T19:26:27,MrMongMong,And that is true dedication.
14-12-2018T19:26:30,Xexanoth,"""Curiousity killed the Basitin"""
14-12-2018T19:26:32,CrimsonQuill,Uh Oh.
14-12-2018T19:26:37,Bgrmystr2,"that's not even what it means, Mong xD"
14-12-2018T19:26:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Can't wait for Roberto bot to get here
14-12-2018T19:26:44,CrimsonQuill,Something tells me that's the third floor enterance.
14-12-2018T19:26:48,Xexanoth,which mean twokinds play on mars....
14-12-2018T19:26:52,Azumachan,A golem ?
14-12-2018T19:27:11,CrimsonQuill,A golem like Dorfl or Mr Pump?
14-12-2018T19:27:31,CrimsonQuill,"Sorry, another Terry Pratchett Reference."
14-12-2018T19:27:36,MrMongMong,"Plot Twist: The big door is the equivalent of taking the red pill, the small one the equivalent of taking the blue pill, and the dragon is Morpheus."
14-12-2018T19:27:41,CrimsonQuill,But I have a very bad feeling about this.
14-12-2018T19:27:44,sunblaze,just as nibs does not seem to be an ordinary animal nibblybot is nt an ordinary bot
14-12-2018T19:27:54,Xexanoth,plot twist: the room is empty
14-12-2018T19:27:57,CrimsonQuill,Euchre said that Trace musn't see the third floor.
14-12-2018T19:28:38,CrimsonQuill,"When someone says 'Person X must not see Y and Z', they have pretty much made sure that narrativium will conspire to show person X the forbidden stuff."
14-12-2018T19:28:45,CrimsonQuill,It's just how stories work...
14-12-2018T19:28:50,MrMongMong,Plot twist: Euchre said that because he doesn't want Trace to know that he spent the money on buying cool stuff instead of hiring a contractor.
14-12-2018T19:28:56,CrimsonQuill,"If you say it has to be hidden, it'll want to come out."
14-12-2018T19:29:03,MrMongMong,So the third floor wasn't done.
14-12-2018T19:29:13,CrimsonQuill,It's like the One Ring-it WANTS to be found.
14-12-2018T19:29:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,the one ring to bling them all
14-12-2018T19:29:33,CrimsonQuill,And Maddie and Karen are unwitting pawns in the Mask's game...
14-12-2018T19:29:59,CrimsonQuill,"Grief, I just want to go up to the masks and blow them up with Reality Bombs."
14-12-2018T19:30:09,MrMongMong,Is Euphemeral(Ephemeral? Epheumeral? Efemeral?) still around?
14-12-2018T19:30:18,CrimsonQuill,"I think so, but broken."
14-12-2018T19:30:24,CrimsonQuill,But both masks...
14-12-2018T19:30:28,MrMongMong,How can a god be broken?
14-12-2018T19:30:37,CrimsonQuill,I have a HUGE hatred of gods playing god.
14-12-2018T19:30:42,CrimsonQuill,"Or, playing GOD."
14-12-2018T19:31:06,CrimsonQuill,"Ephemeral was (sort of) shattered after chapter 6, right?"
14-12-2018T19:31:13,CrimsonQuill,"So, couldn't one just..."
14-12-2018T19:31:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,what about Gods playing Dogs?
14-12-2018T19:31:43,CrimsonQuill,I don't really see the Masks as gods as much as meddling 'divine beings'.
14-12-2018T19:32:14,MrMongMong,"I has a theory that E (that's what I'm calling Efphemeral) is actually a sort of spren(Brandon Sanderson universe, in which things that sentient beings identify as living, such as an idea manifest into a construct with abilities relating to the concept)"
14-12-2018T19:32:19,CrimsonQuill,"I created a character in my head, and an entire world, who's one and only purpose was to go against the destiny and destroy the gods."
14-12-2018T19:32:30,SageSaga,all done
14-12-2018T19:32:32,MrMongMong,And that he is a spren of Keidrian.
14-12-2018T19:32:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Very well done Sagw

14-12-2018T19:34:04,CrimsonQuill,"realises that it's 1:30am, and they need to finish 'The Ancient Magus Bride', but doesn't want to leave the chat in case they miss something..."

14-12-2018T19:35:17,Twokinds,I just streamed already
14-12-2018T19:35:28,CrimsonQuill,"When I first read Twokinds, I got to chapter 10 at a chapter a day...and then read chapters 10-19 in an afternoon."
14-12-2018T19:35:35,CrimsonQuill,That was a year ago.
14-12-2018T19:35:43,FoxxTrotter,"Later, everyone. :0)"
14-12-2018T19:35:45,Bgrmystr2,"He already streamed earlier today, and posted the page that he finished."
14-12-2018T19:35:47,CrimsonQuill,"Now, it's a strict 'one chapter per day' basis."
14-12-2018T19:35:51,CrimsonQuill,Buy Foxx
14-12-2018T19:35:53,CrimsonQuill,Bye
14-12-2018T19:35:58,MrMongMong,Question for Tom: Will Tom's Pizza Delivery ever come back?

14-12-2018T19:36:35,CrimsonQuill,Good morning guys-and goodbye!

14-12-2018T21:20:57,SpazztasticKiwi,The feel that comes with taking down a hair bun
14-12-2018T21:22:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Now it looks like a bird has nested in my hair
14-12-2018T21:33:37,Bgrmystr2,at least now you can say you're a bit of a featherbrain :ptv-laugh:
