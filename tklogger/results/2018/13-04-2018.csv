13-04-2018T00:56:14,SageSaga,it's a pain
13-04-2018T00:56:16,Bgrmystr2,but this is why I don't play public games that require solid teamwork..
13-04-2018T00:56:36,unsteddyphoenix,I mean...statistically...
13-04-2018T00:56:59,Dadrobit,"I miss playing competitive games. But man, I really don't miss it sometimes too."
13-04-2018T00:57:09,BadFoMo,Teamwork in a public game? HaHaHa! I needed that laugh.
13-04-2018T00:57:13,ZRO4825,"Statisitically, I'm one of the top 2 players on my team, and often outperforming much of the other team. But I can't fight 1v6 and win. I'm not THAT good."

13-04-2018T00:57:28,unsteddyphoenix,I like...the idea of playing competitive. But I never get around to it.
13-04-2018T00:58:29,unsteddyphoenix,"Sure, but even assuming like 60% of games you cant influence, if youre influencing the other 40% and have a negative winrate then?"
13-04-2018T00:58:46,unsteddyphoenix,Or you could just be super unlucky shrug.
13-04-2018T00:58:51,ZRO4825,I'm one of 6 pieces of influence on a team.
13-04-2018T00:59:00,Dadrobit,"Being a part of a good clan/guild/corporation helps a lot for getting reliable teammates and critique on your form, but it's just a lot of upkeep on your total time."
13-04-2018T00:59:11,Bgrmystr2,winning 1/3 of games when you have a 1/6 influence is still pretty decent
13-04-2018T00:59:14,Bgrmystr2,if everyone on your team is trash
13-04-2018T00:59:21,unsteddyphoenix,Ive defintely experienced getting good stats and losing and not understanding why.

13-04-2018T01:33:13,Bgrmystr2,fairly sure the emu war wouldn't do very well if it happened here.
13-04-2018T01:33:32,Bgrmystr2,Austrailia I can understand cuz of resource costs and the huge area they had to cover

13-04-2018T01:50:45,ZRO4825,"Hey, now there's a question of curiosity. What do you think is your closest image to crossing the NSFW line, Sage?"
13-04-2018T01:50:47,Dadrobit,Push the line.
13-04-2018T01:50:59,unsteddyphoenix,step out of line
13-04-2018T01:51:00,Dadrobit,The exploding cake

13-04-2018T01:51:09,Bgrmystr2,I dunno about that one dadro
13-04-2018T01:51:15,Bgrmystr2,but that was pretty good tho
13-04-2018T01:51:27,Dadrobit,"Iirc, it was just frosting pasties?"
13-04-2018T01:51:35,ZRO4825,Pretty much :joy:
13-04-2018T01:51:36,SageSaga,hmm- if NSFW as we define it for streams and all that-
13-04-2018T01:51:41,Bgrmystr2,yeah but that's nothing new for sage honestly..
13-04-2018T01:51:45,Bgrmystr2,from what it seems like
13-04-2018T01:51:56,SageSaga,Some of the Nyna stuff comes close because shes almost totally nude and view able in some
13-04-2018T01:52:06,sunblaze,true yes
13-04-2018T01:52:07,ZRO4825,:thinking: Very true.
13-04-2018T01:52:27,ZRO4825,"Nyna the ""nyahaha you get to see nothing even though it probably should be in view!"" expert."
13-04-2018T01:52:36,SageSaga,"but NSFW as in ""Naughty Stuff"" probably one of the old Nyna and Kaylin Sketches"
13-04-2018T01:52:37,unsteddyphoenix,No nipples = safe
13-04-2018T01:52:47,SageSaga,like Nyna nibbling on Kaylin's ear
13-04-2018T01:52:55,sunblaze,nomnomnom!

13-04-2018T01:53:15,SageSaga,oh and then there was the drawings for the NSFW stream where i fooled everyone
13-04-2018T01:53:21,ZRO4825,Sage's work is always great for scientific research.
13-04-2018T01:53:33,Bgrmystr2,also worthy of posting for great justice and science :v
13-04-2018T01:53:35,ZRO4825,I &lt;3 'd that stream.

13-04-2018T01:53:44,Bgrmystr2,how long ago was it
13-04-2018T01:53:50,ZRO4825,"It was on a Sunday, few weeks ago. :V"
13-04-2018T01:53:54,SageSaga,about a month ago on a Sunday
13-04-2018T01:53:56,ZRO4825,maybe a month or so?
13-04-2018T01:53:59,Bgrmystr2,oh really

13-04-2018T01:54:27,Bgrmystr2,"oh actually, I recall that"
13-04-2018T01:54:30,Bgrmystr2,yeah
13-04-2018T01:54:38,ZRO4825,"Speaking of Maty, ain't seen her recently, everything okay in her neck of the woods? o.O"
13-04-2018T01:54:59,SageSaga,she's been busy but she tries to always make the Saturday stream
13-04-2018T01:55:20,ZRO4825,"Ahhh, yeah, was talking to her, seems like she gets stuck staying REALLY busy a lot :("
13-04-2018T01:56:07,ZRO4825,I keep getting screwed for doing more than popping in here and there for Saturday. Silly job keeps working me at 2-9 &gt;:(
13-04-2018T01:57:39,SageSaga,this one was pretty close

13-04-2018T02:00:30,sunblaze,thats like saying tom from twikinds has never done naked. in fact flory is like 99% of the time that way. she just hides it well D:
13-04-2018T02:00:45,ZRO4825,Hmm....if I didn't like using up 2 months at a time I'd maybe set one of these as my color image at some point. :joy:
13-04-2018T02:00:53,Bgrmystr2,this isn't even nsfw tho
13-04-2018T02:00:54,sunblaze,she has a weakness to massagetechniques?

13-04-2018T02:14:01,ZRO4825,=D
13-04-2018T02:14:20,unsteddyphoenix,If you train them well enough they'll instinctively drool when they see your art.
13-04-2018T02:14:28,SageSaga,though i like to rely on Zro having something early for me!
13-04-2018T02:14:40,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: So Zro..

13-04-2018T02:19:14,Dadrobit,"I want to go to SDCC this year, but I was just reading an update from PHXCC, and they're holding a smoulder cosplay competition."
13-04-2018T02:19:27,Dadrobit,And that's like 80% of who I am.
13-04-2018T02:19:34,SageSaga,im hoping i dont die - we will be going to a lot of places i will not be able to eat at XD
13-04-2018T02:19:34,unsteddyphoenix,That means less competition for your cosplay
13-04-2018T02:19:46,unsteddyphoenix,"Well Toms not eating anyway, just join him"
13-04-2018T02:20:03,Bgrmystr2,haha
13-04-2018T02:20:35,SageSaga,Tom is not eating because he needs to learn to cook and go out and get food and not just have it all delivered :P
13-04-2018T02:20:47,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-flat:
13-04-2018T02:20:47,Dadrobit,"Also, being banned from every CC would be a heck of a feat without being a felon."
13-04-2018T02:20:52,unsteddyphoenix,Im pretty sure he can make rice

13-04-2018T02:21:23,unsteddyphoenix,The problem with that is then the food wont be a surprise anymore :T
13-04-2018T02:21:27,Dadrobit,"""Alexa, order me some pancakes"" -Tom probably."

13-04-2018T02:30:49,sunblaze,not a fan of fudge. but in that case it seems awesome!
13-04-2018T02:31:04,Twokinds,man
13-04-2018T02:31:13,SageSaga,not even hot fudge on icecream?
13-04-2018T02:31:14,Twokinds,"I'm not saying I wouldn't eat it, but that's gotta be so many calories"
13-04-2018T02:31:49,sunblaze,on milky icecream perhaps. but I prefer sorbet e.g. the fruites kinds
13-04-2018T02:31:49,SageSaga,you inhaled a steak...

13-04-2018T02:32:22,Twokinds,It's protein!
13-04-2018T02:32:23,SageSaga,it's really not..

13-04-2018T02:34:22,Twokinds,I'm usually a very slow eater.
13-04-2018T02:34:47,Twokinds,Though that's mostly because I sit at my computer distracted.
13-04-2018T02:34:56,Twokinds,I don't remember.
13-04-2018T02:35:07,SageSaga,you didnt eat super fast at that Rock and Roll Cafe in Atlanta

13-04-2018T02:37:58,SageSaga,its a BBQ place where they put a giant piece of butcher paper on the table so they can just throw it away
13-04-2018T02:37:59,Bgrmystr2,or just wanted it
13-04-2018T02:38:09,SageSaga,we all drew pictures on it while we ate delicious bbq and ribs
13-04-2018T02:38:29,Bgrmystr2,xD
13-04-2018T02:38:41,SageSaga,and we had this random fan that just tagged along with us to this place after the con was over XD

13-04-2018T02:51:42,Dadrobit,"Oh, and if you're still lurking, have a good night, Tom."

13-04-2018T02:51:54,SageSaga,pretty much- i'll see if i can show it anyways
13-04-2018T02:52:36,Bgrmystr2,Oh I can see that
13-04-2018T02:52:36,Dadrobit,"That was only 8 minutes ago, and it was only the first time he said it, I can make a pretty safe bet there"
13-04-2018T02:53:18,SageSaga,very light
13-04-2018T02:53:26,Bgrmystr2,That's cool though
13-04-2018T02:53:28,Bgrmystr2,yeah it is
13-04-2018T02:54:04,Bgrmystr2,"I kinda envy you guys, artists.. you can go anywhere and doodle somethin, and instantly it's worth money to someone"
13-04-2018T02:54:16,Bgrmystr2,even like.. stuff you draw on things people throw away
13-04-2018T02:54:43,Bgrmystr2,that's just so cool to imagine being able to do that
13-04-2018T02:54:43,Dadrobit,I think that applies to public figures in general.
13-04-2018T02:54:51,SageSaga,it's reeeeeeally hard to turn drawings into money
13-04-2018T02:54:56,SageSaga,especially for humble folk
13-04-2018T02:55:05,SageSaga,and believe it or not- im pretty humble
13-04-2018T02:55:25,ZRO4825,In comparison to a lot of artists I've seen? I'd agree.
13-04-2018T02:56:14,Bgrmystr2,"I mean.. I've seen people sell items from hotels that artists go to.. when they doodled on the little notes or whatever they leave behind, etc"
13-04-2018T02:56:18,SageSaga,i also under charge for my time
13-04-2018T02:57:00,ZRO4825,I know a number of decently good artists who do that. Also seen a number who think their time is made of diamonds or some shit. &lt;_&lt;;
13-04-2018T02:57:38,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, their time is now diamonds.."
13-04-2018T02:57:43,SageSaga,they are probably better off for it though
13-04-2018T02:57:46,Bgrmystr2,and I'm on a horse? :u
13-04-2018T02:58:08,SageSaga,yall know i barely live paycheck to paycheck right?
13-04-2018T02:58:16,Bgrmystr2,know that feel lol
13-04-2018T02:58:19,ZRO4825,I do :(
13-04-2018T02:58:25,Bgrmystr2,but yeah
13-04-2018T02:59:40,Dadrobit,"That's the thing, if entrepreneurs don't charge for what they feel they're worth, then the buyers certainly won't see them as worth it either. Irrespective of ""quality,"" the price tag imprints a  certain sense of worth."
13-04-2018T03:01:36,Dadrobit,"Same for any area, even VO. There are people on Fiverr that sound great, but barely get any business for their $5 quotes, and I see folks on VB that get consistent work while charging out the ass and they sound no better."
13-04-2018T03:01:42,SageSaga,"and then there are people like me who look at their work and say ""Well yeah it takes this amount of effort and time to make but i wouldnt pay that much for this-"""
13-04-2018T03:02:05,LannAF,o
13-04-2018T03:02:08,LannAF,yo
13-04-2018T03:02:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Lann
13-04-2018T03:02:32,Dadrobit,o/ Lann
13-04-2018T03:02:51,SageSaga,Yo lann - 1 hour and 30 minutes till the second episode drops
13-04-2018T03:03:04,Bgrmystr2,hey Lann
13-04-2018T03:03:08,LannAF,ugh
13-04-2018T03:03:18,LannAF,I gotta do a lotta stuff tomorrow
13-04-2018T03:03:25,LannAF,was gonna pop in for a few mins then pop out
13-04-2018T03:03:29,LannAF,but I can stay up if you want
13-04-2018T03:03:32,Dadrobit,"Do you at least do base pay calculations? As in, ""It took two hours for this, so I want at least $15 an hour, so $30 for an average print of this quality?"""
13-04-2018T03:03:43,Dadrobit,Or do you just wing your prices?
13-04-2018T03:03:57,SageSaga,im not gonna make you watch 44 minutes of anime at 5:30am
13-04-2018T03:04:11,ZRO4825,"$15/hr of work on an artpiece I see no problem with, that's fair imo."
13-04-2018T03:04:21,LannAF,okay thank gods
13-04-2018T03:04:22,LannAF,LOL
13-04-2018T03:04:31,LannAF,when you wake up tomorrow
13-04-2018T03:04:32,ZRO4825,"I saw someone though who was like ""I charge $50/hr for commision work and do it all on stream"" and I'm like ""Holy fucking sheeeit NOPE.."""
13-04-2018T03:04:37,Dadrobit,":/ I disagree, I'd definitely go higher, but that's me."
13-04-2018T03:04:39,LannAF,"We can watch, I'll need a break"
13-04-2018T03:04:39,SageSaga,when i wake up tomorrow i stream
13-04-2018T03:04:42,LannAF,...
13-04-2018T03:04:44,LannAF,After stream?
13-04-2018T03:04:46,Bgrmystr2,XD
13-04-2018T03:05:00,SageSaga,depends on how late- hopefully stream will end around 6pm my time
13-04-2018T03:05:02,ZRO4825,Depends on artist quality Dadro.
13-04-2018T03:05:03,SageSaga,then we could
13-04-2018T03:05:03,Bgrmystr2,After stream is D&D I think? :o
13-04-2018T03:05:08,Dadrobit,"Because you spend less time overall doing the work, but you still need a livable wage."
13-04-2018T03:05:11,SageSaga,if it runs too late it gets into DnD time
13-04-2018T03:05:23,Bgrmystr2,doesn't your D&D start soon after you finish streaming on Sat?
13-04-2018T03:05:24,LannAF,Hm.
13-04-2018T03:05:31,ZRO4825,"For higher quality like Sage/Tom, definitely willing to go higher. But not much higher or else I'd be a broke bastard before long. :c"
13-04-2018T03:05:32,LannAF,We'll figure something out
13-04-2018T03:05:36,ZRO4825,Well...more broke than I am :joy:
13-04-2018T03:05:38,SageSaga,ive done some pictures that if i charged per hour i would have charged over 120 bucks for- that i did for 50
13-04-2018T03:06:11,SageSaga,im a fan of the flat fees though
13-04-2018T03:06:35,Dadrobit,"That's the thing though, getting personal artwork commissioned is a luxury, not something that should always be afordable by everyone."
13-04-2018T03:06:36,SageSaga,because sometimes i do a picture in an hour and make 60 bucks- and thats good
13-04-2018T03:06:58,SageSaga,"but then you spend 5 hours on one and go ""GAAAAAAH!!!!!"""
13-04-2018T03:07:04,Dadrobit,Ouch
13-04-2018T03:07:25,LannAF,That must feel terrible
13-04-2018T03:07:35,Bgrmystr2,I have mental images of derpface phil
13-04-2018T03:07:41,Bgrmystr2,xD
13-04-2018T03:07:54,SageSaga,heck yall saw the Toyoko and Kaylin picture
13-04-2018T03:08:00,ZRO4825,Yarpz
13-04-2018T03:08:07,SageSaga,it's not done yet and ive spent over 2 hours on it
13-04-2018T03:08:13,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
13-04-2018T03:08:16,Bgrmystr2,the selfie one?
13-04-2018T03:08:26,SageSaga,yeah
13-04-2018T03:08:28,Bgrmystr2,huh
13-04-2018T03:08:33,SageSaga,and im actually really not happy with it
13-04-2018T03:08:41,Bgrmystr2,it looks okay though
13-04-2018T03:08:45,Bgrmystr2,I guess that's not good enough
13-04-2018T03:08:54,ZRO4825,Artists always super-critical of own work~
13-04-2018T03:09:11,ZRO4825,can attest. Even though I don't personally qualify myself as an artist. &gt;:c
13-04-2018T03:09:12,Bgrmystr2,needs to be bettarar
13-04-2018T03:09:26,Bgrmystr2,artist in training lol
13-04-2018T03:09:54,Dadrobit,Yuuuuuuup.
13-04-2018T03:10:09,Dadrobit,I get that feel
13-04-2018T03:10:20,Dadrobit,Friggin hate my own voice half the time.
13-04-2018T03:10:27,LannAF,Hey
13-04-2018T03:10:32,LannAF,"Some will turn out well, some not so much"
13-04-2018T03:10:43,LannAF,"Can't make a beautiful piece every time, and it won't always be smooth sailing"
13-04-2018T03:10:45,LannAF,Long as you try.
13-04-2018T03:10:52,LannAF,And grow from each experience
13-04-2018T03:11:21,SageSaga,yeah but when it's a paid art piece i feel bad when i hand someone something awesome that took and hour and hand something i think is bad and took 6 hours XD
13-04-2018T03:11:55,LannAF,In the end
13-04-2018T03:11:59,SageSaga,"""Here's your artwork and here's your- whatever this is"""
13-04-2018T03:12:01,LannAF,"As long as they're content, that's your baseline"
13-04-2018T03:12:07,LannAF,If something went wrong in your mind
13-04-2018T03:12:18,SageSaga,yeah but that's the most terrifying part!
13-04-2018T03:12:19,LannAF,Then you can always strive to fix it for the next time.
13-04-2018T03:12:41,Bgrmystr2,agree w/ lann
13-04-2018T03:12:44,LannAF,"If they're NOT content, then it's a fire under your arse to fix it. You've done it before, you'll do it again."
13-04-2018T03:12:49,SageSaga,"""If i dont like it- will they? Is it possible? What if i hand it to them and  they go - ""oh- uhh- yeah- thanks""?"""
13-04-2018T03:13:02,LannAF,Then there's not much else you can do.
13-04-2018T03:13:04,SageSaga,LOL
13-04-2018T03:13:11,LannAF,lol
13-04-2018T03:13:13,SageSaga,fix it- sorry- no - no way
13-04-2018T03:13:23,LannAF,Well depends
13-04-2018T03:13:27,LannAF,fix it being
13-04-2018T03:13:32,LannAF,"""OMG IT ALL LOOKS LIKE -CRAP-"""
13-04-2018T03:13:34,LannAF,or

13-04-2018T03:14:24,LannAF,"Point being, can't always do perfect, can't always be content"
13-04-2018T03:14:41,LannAF,But just don't shoot yourself in the foot because of it.

13-04-2018T03:16:56,Dadrobit,Hair tho....
13-04-2018T03:16:58,SageSaga,did yall see the mess about the last few Yosh comics?
13-04-2018T03:17:05,LannAF,"Sage, if we can't do MHA until after DnD tomorrow night, that's fine"
13-04-2018T03:17:08,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
13-04-2018T03:17:09,LannAF,Just pm me when you're available.
13-04-2018T03:17:12,LannAF,I gotta sleep now.
13-04-2018T03:17:25,Bgrmystr2,Have a good night Lann
13-04-2018T03:17:28,SageSaga,sleep well man i will message ya
13-04-2018T03:17:28,LannAF,Goodnight! Thanks for letting me watch a tad and reminding me xD
13-04-2018T03:17:30,Bgrmystr2,hope you guuys enjoy MHA
13-04-2018T03:17:34,LannAF,Sleep well and sweet dreams when you do
13-04-2018T03:17:36,LannAF,o7
13-04-2018T03:17:46,Dadrobit,o/ Lann
13-04-2018T03:17:53,LannAF,"hope you enjoy the rest of the stream bgr, dadrobit, and everyone else."
13-04-2018T03:18:34,SageSaga,so did yall see the Yosh stuff?
13-04-2018T03:18:47,Dadrobit,With the bathing elf ladies?
13-04-2018T03:19:08,Bgrmystr2,I did
13-04-2018T03:19:20,SageSaga,and the people saying they hate Blue and how terrible she is for trapping these elf girls in some kinda torture porn
13-04-2018T03:19:33,Dadrobit,That I missed
13-04-2018T03:19:35,ZRO4825,I did! :joy:
13-04-2018T03:19:52,ZRO4825,"To be fair, that line from the elf was kinda wth, lol"
13-04-2018T03:19:55,Bgrmystr2,wait wot
13-04-2018T03:19:59,unsteddyphoenix,Oh is that what she did?
13-04-2018T03:20:02,unsteddyphoenix,Wild
13-04-2018T03:20:27,Bgrmystr2,"I don't read the comments, I've just been reading the latest pages"
13-04-2018T03:20:30,Bgrmystr2,:C
13-04-2018T03:20:30,Dadrobit,wb unsteddy
13-04-2018T03:20:34,Bgrmystr2,guess I missed the fun
13-04-2018T03:20:37,Bgrmystr2,"and yeh, wb"
13-04-2018T03:20:42,unsteddyphoenix,Hi ho~
13-04-2018T03:20:51,unsteddyphoenix,I forgot that timezones mean you'll still be on when i get back now
13-04-2018T03:21:22,SageSaga,"i get that it was a little ""OMG they are PRISONERS!"" but - that was the point of the character! This is how i write dialogue -"
13-04-2018T03:21:25,Dadrobit,It's 1:20am....
13-04-2018T03:21:37,SageSaga,4:21 am for me
13-04-2018T03:22:06,SageSaga,"i write dialogue by saying ""The characters are in this situation- this is their personality - how would they react to this or that?"""
13-04-2018T03:22:15,SageSaga,and it was easy for the Pink haired Elf
13-04-2018T03:22:42,SageSaga,"her PROGRAMMING is ""Do whatever you can to make sure the target of the dialogue does something so you can reward them"""
13-04-2018T03:23:12,SageSaga,"so if you are saying ""I need to get out of the simulation"" it goes ""oh- well i can turn that into a way to help us!"""
13-04-2018T03:23:31,Bgrmystr2,Honestly.. it tends to scream the AI is more aware of itself than it should be.
13-04-2018T03:23:34,Bgrmystr2,imo
13-04-2018T03:23:48,SageSaga,"if you said ""I need to go north"" it would be like ""Oh north there is a goblin with a sacred relic of ours! please get it back for us!"""
13-04-2018T03:24:30,SageSaga,but that's the thing- it is aware of what it is- it doesnt have any programming to design a backstory for itself- it knows it is a character
13-04-2018T03:24:49,Bgrmystr2,"that's cool, but kinda scary and sad"
13-04-2018T03:24:51,Bgrmystr2,:u
13-04-2018T03:25:00,SageSaga,it's like when you play one of those make your own game things and you drop a character in with no dialogue options
13-04-2018T03:25:17,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: haven't done that so I don't know
13-04-2018T03:25:28,unsteddyphoenix,"Is it sentient, then?"
13-04-2018T03:25:31,SageSaga,it's supposed to be scary though- the whole point was to stress Serena to make her force the connection with Fire XD
13-04-2018T03:25:49,SageSaga,no its not really sentient - it is still only bound by its programming
13-04-2018T03:26:07,Bgrmystr2,well yeah I get that
13-04-2018T03:26:14,Bgrmystr2,I dunno. I like it
13-04-2018T03:26:18,SageSaga,if it was sentient it would ask for her to unchain her programming
13-04-2018T03:26:48,SageSaga,not be shut down- she doesnt fear being shut down- as i even said- she was shut down prior to that XD it wasnt just left running
13-04-2018T03:26:54,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno if it's being more dramatic? Or if that's the right word, but it's definitely cool"
13-04-2018T03:27:26,SageSaga,btw the reward was that they would help bath you- it was as naughty as Blue could make it
13-04-2018T03:27:36,Bgrmystr2,noice
13-04-2018T03:27:37,Bgrmystr2,but
13-04-2018T03:27:56,unsteddyphoenix,Why would it want to be shut down at all if it wasnt sentient though
13-04-2018T03:28:00,Bgrmystr2,My question is.. how would they expect to help bathe her if the thing was shut down?
13-04-2018T03:28:12,Bgrmystr2,they can't do anything when it's off
13-04-2018T03:28:14,SageSaga,it didnt want to be- it wanted to force a quest to be completed
13-04-2018T03:28:22,SageSaga,if she went back it would the reward her XD
13-04-2018T03:28:31,Bgrmystr2,oooooooooooh
13-04-2018T03:28:35,SageSaga,it would then*
13-04-2018T03:28:35,Bgrmystr2,okay
13-04-2018T03:28:50,Bgrmystr2,"This is legit, I want more of this VR thing you're doin"
13-04-2018T03:28:56,Bgrmystr2,cuz I'm likin that
13-04-2018T03:29:01,unsteddyphoenix,"I see, so it's just trying to complete it's objective in the end"
13-04-2018T03:29:15,SageSaga,like a program XD
13-04-2018T03:29:43,unsteddyphoenix,Unfortunately it doesnt look like that was obvious enough if there was backlash.
13-04-2018T03:29:47,Bgrmystr2,Is that something that pops up sometimes in the comic?
13-04-2018T03:29:52,Bgrmystr2,the vr stuff
13-04-2018T03:29:54,unsteddyphoenix,Admittedly I dont read Yosh but.
13-04-2018T03:29:57,SageSaga,yeah
13-04-2018T03:30:17,SageSaga,Nami is a wizz with the VR and hacking stuff
13-04-2018T03:30:43,SageSaga,she actually hacks things by granting them some consciousness and persuading them basically
13-04-2018T03:31:01,SageSaga,it totally bypasses most security by doing that
13-04-2018T03:31:09,Bgrmystr2,I'm actually curious if you had the page that's up right now w/ the text planned before everyone had problems with the few pages before
13-04-2018T03:31:13,SageSaga,but uses a ton of bandwidth
13-04-2018T03:31:36,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
13-04-2018T03:31:50,SageSaga,i had some of it but i expanded on it because people really didnt understand that they arent True AI characters
13-04-2018T03:31:56,Bgrmystr2,ahh okay
13-04-2018T03:31:57,SageSaga,they are just video game characters XD
13-04-2018T03:32:00,Bgrmystr2,I thought so xD
13-04-2018T03:32:03,unsteddyphoenix,"Does she copy paste the ""sentience code"" or does she create artificial life from scratch each time"
13-04-2018T03:32:26,Bgrmystr2,It seemed a bit much to dedicate basically a whole comic page to explaining it
13-04-2018T03:32:31,SageSaga,she basically does it from scratch each time- there is no copy paste for that XD
13-04-2018T03:34:00,unsteddyphoenix,"That seems like a lot of code, even if she knew exactly what she was doing :thinking:"
13-04-2018T03:34:15,unsteddyphoenix,What's her canon typing speed important character detail
13-04-2018T03:34:20,SageSaga,but she is an AI so a lot of code- not an issue
13-04-2018T03:34:32,SageSaga,shes a Robot girl- an android-
13-04-2018T03:34:59,unsteddyphoenix,Oh I see
13-04-2018T03:35:10,SageSaga,so her typing speed is limited by the processing of whatever she is inputting on XD
13-04-2018T03:35:13,unsteddyphoenix,No interfacing problem then
13-04-2018T03:36:25,Bgrmystr2,well then. Guess she's a faster typer than I am :V
13-04-2018T03:36:39,Bgrmystr2,I definitely can't do that.
13-04-2018T03:37:03,unsteddyphoenix,"Depends, you think you have more ram?"
13-04-2018T03:37:12,Bgrmystr2,I've only got 10gb haha
13-04-2018T03:37:17,Bgrmystr2,I'll lose
13-04-2018T03:37:21,Bgrmystr2,guarentee it
13-04-2018T03:37:25,unsteddyphoenix,unlucky
13-04-2018T03:37:41,Bgrmystr2,I don't need much more than 10gb on Win7 though
13-04-2018T03:37:51,Bgrmystr2,I don't do anything that requires heavy ram usage
13-04-2018T03:37:56,ZRO4825,"I remember when I built this rig, a friend of mine was like ""WTF do you need 16GB of RAM for?!!?"" lol"
13-04-2018T03:38:15,Bgrmystr2,"and for the most part, he would STILL be correct"
13-04-2018T03:38:38,Bgrmystr2,completely legitimate question
13-04-2018T03:38:39,SageSaga,"""Uhmm- i think we were hacked?"" ""You think?"" ""Well- i dont see any real signs but we did have a huge amount of data come in and leave but that's all"" ""Maybe someone is torrenting?"" ""Dude- this is my secure server"""
13-04-2018T03:39:11,Bgrmystr2,xD
13-04-2018T03:39:46,Bgrmystr2,How does she make the AI aware of itself?
13-04-2018T03:40:04,unsteddyphoenix,She asks it a logical fallacy
13-04-2018T03:40:08,Bgrmystr2,or is that just one of those things in the comic that we accept as unexplained awesomeness
13-04-2018T03:40:10,unsteddyphoenix,Hey presto
13-04-2018T03:40:45,SageSaga,i dont really have to answer that because even  current bots do things we cant explain
13-04-2018T03:40:48,SageSaga,XD
13-04-2018T03:40:55,Bgrmystr2,"Hey, fair enough"
13-04-2018T03:41:01,Bgrmystr2,it was worth asking though
13-04-2018T03:41:12,Bgrmystr2,was just curious if you had an answer for it
13-04-2018T03:41:26,SageSaga,"i absolutely love that when you ask a programmer about a bot he made he legit says ""I have no idea how it works"""
13-04-2018T03:41:36,Bgrmystr2,hahaha
13-04-2018T03:41:55,SageSaga,and it is true! bots make bots an you just run them in a loop till you get a super bot!
13-04-2018T03:42:23,Bgrmystr2,and then it becomes self-aware and we all die to nuclear rain
13-04-2018T03:42:52,SageSaga,or it decides that the world would be better with catgirls and makes catgirls
13-04-2018T03:42:58,Bgrmystr2,or that.
13-04-2018T03:43:18,unsteddyphoenix,Thats probably the future
13-04-2018T03:43:19,Bgrmystr2,two completely random examples that are not references in any way whatsoever.
13-04-2018T03:43:23,SageSaga,im just saying- we cant predict how the bots will react so im gonna just hope for something i like
13-04-2018T03:43:46,unsteddyphoenix,The next generation of bots that the older bots create will be exactly the same only cute catgirls
13-04-2018T03:44:09,Bgrmystr2,"I'm just gonna give it respect, me. Honestly, they'll prolly not be a fan of the assholes out there that don't like the whole robot intelligence thing"
13-04-2018T03:44:17,SageSaga,"""Hi, im your new healthcare bot."" ""You are a catgirl"" ""Your internet history helped to decide the form of your personal healthcare bot"""
13-04-2018T03:44:40,Bgrmystr2,"""THIS IS AWESOME!"" - Sage probably"

13-04-2018T03:45:06,Bgrmystr2,right? xD
13-04-2018T03:45:22,SageSaga,"""Guys- my healthcare bot looks like a girl but she - ISNT"" ""Wow- you feel for the trap hard"""

13-04-2018T03:46:09,ZRO4825,Bridget was a trap.
13-04-2018T03:46:14,ZRO4825,Felix is a fuckin ambush. :V
13-04-2018T03:46:17,unsteddyphoenix,*Broget
13-04-2018T03:46:17,Bgrmystr2,was?

13-04-2018T03:46:25,Bgrmystr2,And always will be
13-04-2018T03:46:30,unsteddyphoenix,Felix is just unfair.
13-04-2018T03:46:33,SageSaga,XD
13-04-2018T03:46:40,Bgrmystr2,"Felix is unfair ambush, can confirm."
13-04-2018T03:46:40,SageSaga,ty Unsteddy
13-04-2018T03:46:47,Bgrmystr2,but I kinda saw it coming

13-04-2018T03:47:54,Bgrmystr2,I think I'm at the point where I can tell the difference between a tomboy and a trap upon introduction..

13-04-2018T03:48:15,unsteddyphoenix,oooh
13-04-2018T03:48:19,unsteddyphoenix,tha calls for a test
13-04-2018T03:48:41,Bgrmystr2,"I would need to see like, voice and personality though, like"
13-04-2018T03:48:42,unsteddyphoenix,"Is there a ""trap or Tomboy"" app?"
13-04-2018T03:48:44,Bgrmystr2,not just an image
13-04-2018T03:48:46,unsteddyphoenix,That's a million dollar idea tbh
13-04-2018T03:48:52,Bgrmystr2,cuz an image doesn't really help xD
13-04-2018T03:49:08,unsteddyphoenix,If you cant tell just from the image you a poser
13-04-2018T03:49:11,Bgrmystr2,even real life guys can dress like girls and look truely female
13-04-2018T03:49:20,Bgrmystr2,"""poser"" fuckin lol xD"
13-04-2018T03:49:41,Bgrmystr2,you can't tell ANYTHING from an image xD
13-04-2018T03:49:51,unsteddyphoenix,I refuse to believe with Felix. I dont trust the Rezero author it must be a longcon
13-04-2018T03:49:51,Bgrmystr2,especially when it comes to anime
13-04-2018T03:50:06,unsteddyphoenix,Weeb game weak
13-04-2018T03:50:10,Bgrmystr2,naw
13-04-2018T03:50:14,Bgrmystr2,anime doesn't have tells.
13-04-2018T03:50:16,Bgrmystr2,real life has tells
13-04-2018T03:50:26,Bgrmystr2,"like finger length, and the bone in your neck"
13-04-2018T03:50:28,Bgrmystr2,and a few other things
13-04-2018T03:50:53,Bgrmystr2,anime completely ignores all of those
13-04-2018T03:51:09,SageSaga,Bgr- have you seen Steins gate?
13-04-2018T03:51:15,Bgrmystr2,nope :u

13-04-2018T04:07:38,SageSaga,weeellll guess what-
13-04-2018T04:07:55,Bgrmystr2,season 2? :o
13-04-2018T04:08:06,SageSaga,there is now another anime about a restaurant that has a front door open to another world-
13-04-2018T04:08:18,SageSaga,totally different anime though
13-04-2018T04:08:21,Bgrmystr2,oh.
13-04-2018T04:08:29,Bgrmystr2,I am now disappointed.
13-04-2018T04:08:32,Bgrmystr2,I wanted season 2
13-04-2018T04:08:36,SageSaga,and its quality is much lower- and it already pisses me off
13-04-2018T04:08:40,Bgrmystr2,aww
13-04-2018T04:08:41,ZRO4825,:c
13-04-2018T04:08:56,SageSaga,because they had 2 episodes-
13-04-2018T04:09:28,SageSaga,"get this- this guy goes in - and drinks beer and has some food and they say ""Just make sure the commander doesnt find out about this place!"""
13-04-2018T04:09:39,SageSaga,episode 2 - the guy who said that takes the commander there
13-04-2018T04:09:43,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
13-04-2018T04:09:44,sunblaze,bye
13-04-2018T04:09:49,unsteddyphoenix,ONE JOB
13-04-2018T04:09:50,Bgrmystr2,lolthefuck
13-04-2018T04:09:53,SageSaga,night Sunblaze!
13-04-2018T04:09:55,Bgrmystr2,one fucking job
13-04-2018T04:09:55,SageSaga,take care!
13-04-2018T04:09:57,Bgrmystr2,gnight sun
13-04-2018T04:10:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night sun
13-04-2018T04:10:07,Bgrmystr2,oh sage I wanted to ask
13-04-2018T04:10:16,Bgrmystr2,did you seeeeeeeeeeee
13-04-2018T04:10:22,Bgrmystr2,Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai &lt;- This thing
13-04-2018T04:10:25,unsteddyphoenix,"So like, youre only watching it as a substitute for the one it copied that you liked?"
13-04-2018T04:10:27,Bgrmystr2,from like 2014
13-04-2018T04:10:41,SageSaga,also they basically just eat the same thing and do the same thing over again with another guy who is just the same- none of the cool fantasy creature things-
13-04-2018T04:11:09,SageSaga,never heard of it Bgr
13-04-2018T04:11:31,Bgrmystr2,"I've seen the first couple episodes today, it's interesting"
13-04-2018T04:12:00,SageSaga,"well the episodes are short and at the end they have a live action thing- the first one shows you how to cook what they made and i was like ""Ok cool- cooking show! im down for this-"""
13-04-2018T04:12:18,SageSaga,second episode didnt have the cooking part! just had a guy going out to eat fried chicken! wth
13-04-2018T04:12:29,Bgrmystr2,the fok
13-04-2018T04:12:57,SageSaga,im pretty sure this is one of those filler odd timed shows-
13-04-2018T04:13:14,SageSaga,Japan doesnt have shows broken down into 30 minutes and 1 hour segments-
13-04-2018T04:13:32,SageSaga,so they have some stuff start at like 2:15 and  3:35 and stuff like that
13-04-2018T04:13:53,SageSaga,so they occasionally have these weird 12 minute shows-
13-04-2018T04:13:53,Bgrmystr2,yeh I knew japan was weird
13-04-2018T04:14:02,Bgrmystr2,but I never really looked into their tv stuff
13-04-2018T04:14:11,Bgrmystr2,"weird about the tv show times, I mean"
13-04-2018T04:14:34,Bgrmystr2,do they have endless commercials like we do?
13-04-2018T04:14:37,SageSaga,so this feels like they needed a filler thing and they ripped off an anime i like- added something- but arent really sure what they are
13-04-2018T04:14:39,Bgrmystr2,or is that not a thing?
13-04-2018T04:15:07,SageSaga,i think they have 1 commercial break for a 25-30 minute segment
13-04-2018T04:15:16,Bgrmystr2,god damn
13-04-2018T04:15:22,Bgrmystr2,what I'd give for that for our TV
13-04-2018T04:15:23,SageSaga,thats why a lot of anime has that title card in the middle
13-04-2018T04:15:49,unsteddyphoenix,Lol that's so annoying
13-04-2018T04:15:59,Bgrmystr2,"I thought when they aired anime in japan, it was like.. 15  mins"
13-04-2018T04:16:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Nighty night ya'll, thank you for the strem Sage"
13-04-2018T04:16:07,unsteddyphoenix,later marv
13-04-2018T04:16:09,SageSaga,"its like ""Dun Dun!"" and then when it comes back its like ""DING DING!"" as a way to tell people ""Hey! Its back on!"""
13-04-2018T04:16:11,Bgrmystr2,gnight marv
13-04-2018T04:16:14,SageSaga,night Marv
13-04-2018T04:16:21,ZRO4825,G'night Marv
13-04-2018T04:16:25,Bgrmystr2,yeah I always wondered what that was about sage
13-04-2018T04:16:36,unsteddyphoenix,"I bet they have access to a million anime ideas, but instead they give the slot to something that ripped off something successful"
13-04-2018T04:16:37,SageSaga,"you all know ""Who's that pokemon?!"""
13-04-2018T04:16:42,Bgrmystr2,yeah
13-04-2018T04:16:46,unsteddyphoenix,How are new ideas supposed to succeed in these industries
13-04-2018T04:16:51,unsteddyphoenix,ITS PIKACHU
13-04-2018T04:16:54,SageSaga,that was their title card for their break
13-04-2018T04:17:11,SageSaga,"""It's Voltorb!"" ""BOOO YOU SUCK!"""
13-04-2018T04:17:24,unsteddyphoenix,"""FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK"""
13-04-2018T04:17:26,Bgrmystr2,it's a pokeball! &gt;:C
13-04-2018T04:17:34,unsteddyphoenix,They did that for us too though
13-04-2018T04:17:39,unsteddyphoenix,They timed the ad breaks with those
13-04-2018T04:17:39,SageSaga,or even worse- remember in the movie when they did that?
13-04-2018T04:17:44,SageSaga,and said the wrong pokemon?
13-04-2018T04:17:51,unsteddyphoenix,LOL what?

13-04-2018T04:21:28,SageSaga,unless you replace his voice with Bobcat Goldthwait
13-04-2018T04:21:55,unsteddyphoenix,No compromises!
13-04-2018T04:22:08,unsteddyphoenix,I loved the cinemas collective reaction of disgust though

13-04-2018T04:26:04,unsteddyphoenix,It doesnt matter what the voice sounds like if pikachus talking it's unacceptable
13-04-2018T04:26:12,Bgrmystr2,I'd agree
13-04-2018T04:26:21,SageSaga,"at least then it could turn to Ash and be like ""Ash had suffered a severe blow to the head"""

13-04-2018T15:55:15,Vatruvius,If you want to come up with a good idea for a sketch you really have to be creative...for the most part that only happens when you gain a number of years of experience to draw from. A lot of ideas I find sweat are from people who have more experience.
13-04-2018T15:55:40,Vatruvius,Read books...watch shows...just find a lot of content to pull from. Then you can spends hours thinking of cool ideas.
13-04-2018T15:56:07,Vatruvius,Also...if you do not have a huge imagination it takes time...a lot of time.

13-04-2018T17:17:41,Vatruvius,"How would I know I have years more experience, because I am years older than him. Also...I game on PC. I use to game on consoles but I switched over about 6 years ago."

13-04-2018T17:31:48,Vatruvius,His age would indicate a master of some sort.

13-04-2018T18:11:44,DRAGONTANOPUG,"realizes that this matters to absolutely no one, and just wanted attention."
13-04-2018T18:41:05,Vatruvius,That is totally unnecessary. You could have just post a link to the video.
13-04-2018T18:41:22,Bgrmystr2,or not posted anything :U
13-04-2018T18:41:27,Bgrmystr2,that would be fine too

13-04-2018T20:02:59,Bgrmystr2,that's cuz you dared speak against white chocolate
13-04-2018T20:03:09,Bgrmystr2,and you did it  knowingly and openly
13-04-2018T20:03:11,Bgrmystr2,:v
13-04-2018T20:08:27,DRAGONTANOPUG,Eh ill pick any fight

13-04-2018T20:17:59,Vatruvius,Yeah...Bigboi and I were trying yo get a response out of Tom. Was not expecting a kick to be honest...maybe a stop...but at least it was not a ban of any sort.
13-04-2018T20:18:08,Vatruvius,to*
13-04-2018T20:18:31,Bgrmystr2,"hey, you wanted him to respond"

13-04-2018T20:19:24,DRAGONTANOPUG,K even i know its bad to keep asking the same question.
13-04-2018T20:19:55,Bgrmystr2,xD funny you say that
13-04-2018T20:23:18,DRAGONTANOPUG,Also repeatedly ask for cake.
13-04-2018T20:25:51,Vatruvius,We asked once...the second time I was kicked. To be honest...I was going to stop after thst if it didn't work.
13-04-2018T20:26:03,Vatruvius,that
13-04-2018T20:26:12,DRAGONTANOPUG,Was it tom who banned you
13-04-2018T20:26:29,Vatruvius,Also...I was not even a week into yhis community yet.
13-04-2018T20:26:43,DRAGONTANOPUG,Im about two weeks in
13-04-2018T20:26:51,Vatruvius,Tom kicked me...there is a difference.

13-04-2018T20:27:28,Bgrmystr2,"tom kicked you out of a tease, Vatru, it wasn't even a serious thing"
13-04-2018T20:27:57,Bgrmystr2,"Wip here on the other hand, is a different story"
13-04-2018T20:28:37,DRAGONTANOPUG,I got banned for asking somone to stop. üòë

13-04-2018T20:29:36,DRAGONTANOPUG,Could care less

13-04-2018T20:32:55,DRAGONTANOPUG,=/
13-04-2018T20:43:42,Vatruvius,Yeak...it was not a serious kick. Also
13-04-2018T20:44:07,Vatruvius,Also...caring about this stream/chat is what keeps you from getting banned.
13-04-2018T20:46:42,Bgrmystr2,prettymuch
13-04-2018T21:05:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"I forgot to mention: the other day, I had a random little girl point at me and say ‚Äúmommy‚Äù"

13-04-2018T22:17:20,DRAGONTANOPUG,Oh
13-04-2018T22:17:39,Vatruvius,I just have to pick between tgese three though.

13-04-2018T22:18:03,DRAGONTANOPUG,What 3
13-04-2018T22:18:50,Vatruvius,You get to vote...you just cannot make a suggestion. And do not become a patreon just to suggest ideas...though that is a perk. The point is to support Tom and his work.
13-04-2018T22:21:16,DRAGONTANOPUG,Thats what i meant..... if i wanted to support tom i would do the 1 dollar one.
13-04-2018T22:21:41,DRAGONTANOPUG,But im not saying i dont want too
13-04-2018T22:30:09,Vatruvius,You there Bgr? I am stuck between three sketch suggestions.
13-04-2018T22:31:48,Bgrmystr2,"I am, but I can't help you with that :v"
13-04-2018T22:32:06,Vatruvius,Dang it.
13-04-2018T22:32:36,Bgrmystr2,I don't want to know anyway
13-04-2018T22:32:51,Bgrmystr2,I don't like knowing suggestions before I see it on the vote page
13-04-2018T22:32:57,Vatruvius,I was not going to tell you my suggestions.
13-04-2018T22:33:01,Bgrmystr2,k good
13-04-2018T22:33:22,Bgrmystr2,cuz that'd affect my voting :P
13-04-2018T22:33:43,Vatruvius,"Just need to know if I should submit the cool one, the sweat one, or the cute one?"
13-04-2018T22:34:56,Bgrmystr2,"don't suggest sweat, that's just gross. Unless it's like.. sweat from a fight or somethin"
13-04-2018T22:34:58,Bgrmystr2,those are cool :v
13-04-2018T22:35:11,Bgrmystr2,kinda like when Natani and Keith were sparring
13-04-2018T22:35:22,Bgrmystr2,:v
13-04-2018T22:35:26,Bgrmystr2,Or Keith vs Keith
13-04-2018T22:35:28,Bgrmystr2,that was good too
13-04-2018T22:44:49,Vatruvius,Not that kind of sweat...I think I will settle on the cool one.
13-04-2018T22:47:13,Bgrmystr2,there's only one kind of sweat.
13-04-2018T22:49:07,DRAGONTANOPUG,Dont you only get to suggest once a month
13-04-2018T22:50:07,Bgrmystr2,you suggest every time there's a suggestion stream on sunday
13-04-2018T23:04:13,Vatruvius,So you are not a sap Bgr?
13-04-2018T23:04:32,Bgrmystr2,I am not part of a tree if that's what you're asking.
13-04-2018T23:04:49,Bgrmystr2,"Can confirm, I am not tree sap."
13-04-2018T23:07:39,Vatruvius,lol
