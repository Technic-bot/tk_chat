12-12-2018T00:48:40,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs nice
12-12-2018T00:49:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Apparently Jason got hit in the face with a plate of glass. It‚Äôs why his eyebrow has a missing spot
12-12-2018T00:49:49,SpazztasticKiwi,And it popped his eye out
12-12-2018T00:58:32,Twokinds,:O My eye is fine

12-12-2018T01:06:16,Twokinds,"speaking of less stress, it's time for bed."

12-12-2018T01:07:36,RimaDraws,goodnight all!~
12-12-2018T01:08:11,Dadrobit,":/ I wish I was less stressed, borked laptop being returned means I have to do my backlog on a laptop that was so borked I needed the new laptop that just got sent back."
12-12-2018T01:08:30,Dadrobit,"Have a good night, Tom and Rima."
12-12-2018T01:09:33,Dadrobit,"I mean, it's working well actually, pre-borked productivity. But I can no longer trust it like I used to."
12-12-2018T01:10:58,Dadrobit,S'like an old girlfriend coming back to you after you found her sleeping with the neighbor's lawyer. Maybe even the lawyer's dog. You just can't really ever feel at ease again...
12-12-2018T01:17:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Night Tom
12-12-2018T01:17:41,Twokinds,G'night Kiwi!
12-12-2018T01:18:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I was wondering if he‚Äôd pull the Jason card. Half considered just calling the dude Momoa instead
12-12-2018T01:18:47,SpazztasticKiwi,But the references are fun
12-12-2018T01:19:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Dude‚Äôs a good actor anyway
12-12-2018T01:20:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Congrats on the destressüçæ
12-12-2018T01:23:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Dadro that description‚Äôs oddly specific. Do you need a hug
12-12-2018T01:25:38,Dadrobit,"No, I need to get off my rear and go record the second part of this Christmas Special broadcast is what I need to do."
12-12-2018T01:26:26,Dadrobit,"And besides, Marv isn't here."
12-12-2018T01:37:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Yo
12-12-2018T01:40:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Ah I see
12-12-2018T01:40:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hugs dad
12-12-2018T01:46:18,Dadrobit,Thanks Marv. My laptop is still kind of a dogfucker though.
12-12-2018T03:08:33,Dadrobit,"https://i.imgur.com/oPDZxVV.jpg Well, time to burn the house down."
12-12-2018T03:11:02,Dadrobit,Update: Hand torch applied. Spider is very ded. Living room smells of roasted spider. Worth.
12-12-2018T03:11:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Sounds like someone‚Äôs having a great day
12-12-2018T03:12:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Am I counting 9 legs on that thing or are the shadows being dicky
12-12-2018T03:12:28,Dadrobit,"Shadows are being dicky, it had eight."
12-12-2018T03:12:58,SpazztasticKiwi,At least it didn‚Äôt jump on you
12-12-2018T03:13:03,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ö∞Ô∏è
12-12-2018T03:14:13,Dadrobit,I would have probably slept in my car tonight if it had survived the initial torching and escaped.
12-12-2018T03:15:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Makes you more sensitive to the random tickles on your neck
12-12-2018T03:15:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Is it your hair
12-12-2018T03:15:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Or a new friend
12-12-2018T03:17:26,Dadrobit,"As someone with long hair that often screws around on my neck, this is a major concern."
12-12-2018T03:18:55,SpazztasticKiwi,You‚Äôre welcome for your newfound paranoia
12-12-2018T03:26:05,Dadrobit,"Trust me, this isn't newfound."
12-12-2018T03:32:40,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: what kind of spider is that
12-12-2018T03:32:42,Bgrmystr2,I don't recognise
12-12-2018T03:33:02,Bgrmystr2,"also, killed with fire, good job :fire: / 10"
12-12-2018T06:17:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"@Dadrobit Its time to move buddy,  Who knows how long before that turns into Kumonga.  Get outta dodge when you can"
12-12-2018T06:37:38,Dadrobit,It is a crispy critter now. Pressurized butane power was applied directly to the Nope.
12-12-2018T07:13:13,CrimsonQuill,I DON'T LIKE SPIDERS.....
12-12-2018T07:13:34,SageSaga,Oh yeah? What about- sexy spiders?
12-12-2018T07:13:46,CrimsonQuill,"I remember a while back I was woken up at 1:00am by something crawlikg over my shoulder. Also, hullo Sage."
12-12-2018T07:14:05,CrimsonQuill,It was a big house spider on my bed...
12-12-2018T07:14:33,CrimsonQuill,"I know the proverb says 'let the spider run alive', but there's only so much I'm prepared to put up with..."
12-12-2018T07:14:40,CrimsonQuill,I crushed it with a slipper.
12-12-2018T07:14:59,CrimsonQuill,I had trouble getting back to sleep...
12-12-2018T07:15:34,CrimsonQuill,"BTW @SageSaga, I've got to the latest A.I. strip-it is very good!"
12-12-2018T07:16:10,SageSaga,I had a dream where a woman turned into a shadow monster with exploding eyes that bit into my side and was ripping out my organs- it woke me up feeling like my side was on fire- after waking up it was fine. So i went back to bed
12-12-2018T07:16:35,SageSaga,im so used to having bad dreams...
12-12-2018T07:17:26,CrimsonQuill,Thank heavens I don't remember mine. God knows what happens when I drift through the realms of sleep...
12-12-2018T07:18:34,SageSaga,also - glad ya enjoy the comic. :D
12-12-2018T07:18:43,CrimsonQuill,You're welcome!
12-12-2018T07:19:01,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-victory::ptv-right:
12-12-2018T07:19:13,SageSaga,I used to have nightmares that made me unable to sleep- but now i just get over it- though... the witches eating me from my toes up was a bit much
12-12-2018T07:19:28,SageSaga,because each time i went back to sleep it was right back to being eaten
12-12-2018T07:19:57,CrimsonQuill,I just blank out until the next morning.
12-12-2018T07:19:59,SageSaga,Ive told that before in the stream here
12-12-2018T07:20:45,CrimsonQuill,One of the things I remember is the idea that one should be careful about saying things like 'dream come true'... because nightmares are dreams too.
12-12-2018T07:20:57,CrimsonQuill,"Thanks, C.S. Lewis and Terry Pratchett..."
12-12-2018T07:23:05,SageSaga,oi- i just checked my scripts- i gotta draw stairs in the next 2 comics-
12-12-2018T07:23:10,SageSaga,freakn stairs man
12-12-2018T07:24:01,CrimsonQuill,"Poe the Panda: 'Ah, my old enemy. STAIRS!'"
12-12-2018T07:24:09,CrimsonQuill,Make that 'PO.
12-12-2018T07:24:15,CrimsonQuill,I mispelled it again.
12-12-2018T07:27:59,SageSaga,"Buildings are a pain to draw, but Stairs are like hundreds of tiny buildings"
12-12-2018T07:28:21,SageSaga,XD not really at all but there's a lot to them being precise or else they dont look right
12-12-2018T07:28:32,CrimsonQuill,"I struggle with basic drawing, and stairs are a nightmare."
12-12-2018T07:28:48,CrimsonQuill,"Or rather, my drawing's rather...amateurish."
12-12-2018T07:28:53,CrimsonQuill,I never did art..
12-12-2018T07:29:14,CrimsonQuill,"I can doodle some things, but I lack patience to take my time and see something grow."
12-12-2018T07:30:03,SageSaga,alright well it 30 minutes till 8am- i should get some sleep
12-12-2018T07:30:07,CrimsonQuill,"Kind of annoying seeing as I want to draw a Subnautica fanart with Markiplier, Jacksepticeye and Tom in some Seamoths."
12-12-2018T07:30:10,SageSaga,take care :P
12-12-2018T07:30:13,CrimsonQuill,Sleep well Sage

12-12-2018T09:30:18,CrimsonQuill,That's good.
12-12-2018T09:30:20,Twokinds,Still no coffee. I am now taking caffeine in tablets.
12-12-2018T09:30:39,CrimsonQuill,Sage said it was almost 8:00am when he went...
12-12-2018T09:30:46,Twokinds,It's been good so far. I am glad I've cut back on sugar.
12-12-2018T09:30:48,CrimsonQuill,We talked about spiders and nightmares.
12-12-2018T09:30:56,Twokinds,Yeah Sage has a really bad sleep schedule.
12-12-2018T09:30:59,CrimsonQuill,"Also, nice to see the coffe detox is going well."
12-12-2018T09:31:57,CrimsonQuill,I recently cooked up a monstrosity.
12-12-2018T09:32:10,CrimsonQuill,I challenge you to ask what.
12-12-2018T09:36:46,iliar,Caffeine in tablets?! Hmm. Sometimes I doing break with coffee. But I doing it because i coffee contains a lot of caffeine
12-12-2018T09:37:06,CrimsonQuill,I never drink coffee...tastes bitter.
12-12-2018T09:37:08,Twokinds,"""Why"""
12-12-2018T09:37:24,Twokinds,And I quit coffee because of the high amount of sugar I was eating.
12-12-2018T09:37:44,iliar,A lot of caffeine create problems with health.
12-12-2018T09:37:57,Twokinds,"I cannot have black coffee, because I don't want to, so I stopped drinking coffee."
12-12-2018T09:38:32,Twokinds,"I was drinking 3 cups of coffee, which is ~285mg of caffeine."
12-12-2018T09:38:43,Twokinds,The caffeine tablet is only 100mg of caffeine.
12-12-2018T09:38:54,CrimsonQuill,That's about the same number of cups my dad has in a day.
12-12-2018T09:38:57,Twokinds,An almost 1/3 decrease.
12-12-2018T09:39:00,CrimsonQuill,"Mind, he needs it."
12-12-2018T09:39:22,Twokinds,"Er, 2/3 decrease"
12-12-2018T09:39:39,CrimsonQuill,Woah/
12-12-2018T09:52:36,Azumachan,"caffeine is a lot like drinking unicorn blood to stay immortal. You will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment it touches your lips."
12-12-2018T09:52:58,Twokinds,Honestly pretty true
12-12-2018T09:52:58,CrimsonQuill,"Thank you, Firenze."
12-12-2018T09:53:24,Azumachan,I have to get my 2 tablets a day
12-12-2018T09:53:58,Twokinds,The tablets are just to slowly wean off the stuff so I don't get headaches.
12-12-2018T09:54:09,Azumachan,Yeah
12-12-2018T09:54:24,Azumachan,You do have to be careful
12-12-2018T09:54:29,CrimsonQuill,"It'll take time, anyhow..."
12-12-2018T09:54:48,Azumachan,From experience is very temptig on a busy day to pop them like candies
12-12-2018T09:59:06,iliar,"I have a problem, if I start to drink coffee, then every day I drink more and more. And when I drink more than a few liters a day I have trouble sleeping"
12-12-2018T09:59:26,iliar,I do not care about sugar.
12-12-2018T10:00:14,CrimsonQuill,The problem (with any bad habit I have) is that if I go ONCE off track it's a downward spiral back to square one.
12-12-2018T10:02:10,CrimsonQuill,"Well, i'm off. I have to catch a bus soon, and I need to finish packing."

12-12-2018T17:42:33,CrimsonQuill,It is currently 22:42 hours...
12-12-2018T17:43:30,CrimsonQuill,I was watching a David Attenborough Documentary about a recently discovered species of Titanosaur that I'd watched a year before.
12-12-2018T17:43:53,TerraTheWizard,why did you put hours on the end of that :ctwokinds-floraquestion:
12-12-2018T17:43:58,CrimsonQuill,Dinosaurs and paleontology are amazing...
12-12-2018T17:44:28,CrimsonQuill,@TerraTheWizard I put hours on the end because it popped into my mind from a D-Day comic I read.
12-12-2018T17:44:53,CrimsonQuill,"A series of 5 graphic novels, one for each Beach-from the 65th anniversary"
12-12-2018T17:45:02,CrimsonQuill,When I was younger

12-12-2018T17:55:34,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I have to go to bed shortly anyhow."
12-12-2018T17:55:40,CrimsonQuill,Time zones are annoying.
12-12-2018T17:55:42,TerraTheWizard,but it's only almost 11pm
12-12-2018T17:55:46,CrimsonQuill,Yep
12-12-2018T17:56:02,TerraTheWizard,so i coulda been doing stuff
12-12-2018T17:56:10,CrimsonQuill,Did anything interesting in the chat happen between 3 and now/
12-12-2018T17:56:12,CrimsonQuill,?
12-12-2018T17:56:19,TerraTheWizard,"but i went ""welp, it's too late to start that thing"""
12-12-2018T17:56:26,CrimsonQuill,Heh.
12-12-2018T17:56:36,TerraTheWizard,so i just wasted an hour
12-12-2018T17:56:43,TerraTheWizard,and i now have nothing to do
12-12-2018T17:56:54,CrimsonQuill,Maybe read a book.
12-12-2018T17:57:10,TerraTheWizard,i don't have any
12-12-2018T17:57:11,TerraTheWizard,i think
12-12-2018T17:57:15,CrimsonQuill,Oh dear.
12-12-2018T17:57:19,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion: hmmm
12-12-2018T17:57:27,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I'll stay a bit longer to alleviate the boredom."
12-12-2018T17:57:45,CrimsonQuill,"I'd like to ask, when did you start reading the comic?."
12-12-2018T17:58:40,TerraTheWizard,sometime between 2009 & 2011
12-12-2018T17:58:46,CrimsonQuill,Lucky you.
12-12-2018T17:58:52,TerraTheWizard,i'm not actually sure when it was i started
12-12-2018T17:59:00,TerraTheWizard,because my memory says 2009
12-12-2018T17:59:09,TerraTheWizard,but my personal archive says 2011
12-12-2018T17:59:34,TerraTheWizard,"so either i didn't start saving stuff for a while, or my memory is potato"
12-12-2018T17:59:41,TerraTheWizard,both probably
12-12-2018T17:59:55,CrimsonQuill,I was told about it by my best friend in 2016. I wasn't in the right mind to read those sorts of things at the time...the first strip I saw was when Kat was almost crushed by a burning ship beam. I didn't start then though...
12-12-2018T18:00:03,CrimsonQuill,I began reading in December 2017.
12-12-2018T18:00:16,CrimsonQuill,"By that stage, I felt I might actually like it-give it a shot."
12-12-2018T18:00:26,CrimsonQuill,"Man, am I glad I did."
12-12-2018T18:00:38,TerraTheWizard,i got a friend reading it alongside me when i found it
12-12-2018T18:00:47,TerraTheWizard,he stopped reading a few years ago though
12-12-2018T18:00:48,CrimsonQuill,"Now, I have more webcomics to read than I know what to do with."
12-12-2018T18:00:56,CrimsonQuill,I introduced my sister to it.
12-12-2018T18:01:03,TerraTheWizard,then today he asked me to tell him when flora has the babby then he'd start reading again
12-12-2018T18:01:04,TerraTheWizard,lol
12-12-2018T18:01:05,CrimsonQuill,"She likes it, but hasn't read it in a bit."
12-12-2018T18:01:20,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, that won't happen anytime soon."
12-12-2018T18:01:43,CrimsonQuill,I find it very difficult to find the right accents and voice tones for characters...
12-12-2018T18:02:06,CrimsonQuill,I often mesh things together.
12-12-2018T18:02:29,TerraTheWizard,"i have voices for them, but i don't know how i'd describe them"
12-12-2018T18:02:30,TerraTheWizard,lol
12-12-2018T18:02:37,CrimsonQuill,"For example, from the moment Keith was introduced, I immedietely decided to give him a British accent."
12-12-2018T18:02:46,CrimsonQuill,It works SO well with him.
12-12-2018T18:02:54,CrimsonQuill,It's the one I'm best with.
12-12-2018T18:03:10,CrimsonQuill,All the Basitins have British accents in my head...
12-12-2018T18:03:26,TerraTheWizard,i went with a mix of british & aussie
12-12-2018T18:03:42,CrimsonQuill,"And characters like Euchre, Nora, Reni, Sirius, and Roselyn also have British Accents."
12-12-2018T18:04:01,CrimsonQuill,I don't know what regions of the US give what accents though.
12-12-2018T18:04:33,TerraTheWizard,well rose when she's not in butler mode has a southern us accent
12-12-2018T18:05:08,CrimsonQuill,The best way I can describe Trace's voice is a mix between Saitama (in the One Punch Man Dub) and someone else...
12-12-2018T18:05:38,CrimsonQuill,"I always have a British accent for Rose...when her facade drops, it seems a more working-class accent suits her..."
12-12-2018T18:05:54,CrimsonQuill,Raine's voice is the most difficult to pin down.
12-12-2018T18:06:13,CrimsonQuill,"Which is a bit of bother, considering she's my favourite character..."
12-12-2018T18:06:24,CrimsonQuill,I think I'm finding the right voice for her.
12-12-2018T18:07:55,CrimsonQuill,"It mixes bits of Cortana from Halo, Kara from Detroit Become Human, and a few other bits and pieces."
12-12-2018T18:08:14,CrimsonQuill,It's always so hard to find a proper voice for characters one reads about...
12-12-2018T18:09:11,TerraTheWizard,TheStooge makes 'voice cast' videos
12-12-2018T18:09:33,CrimsonQuill,I'm not sure I want to know what that is...
12-12-2018T18:09:34,TerraTheWizard,where he choses a bunch of voice actors that could fill certain character roles
12-12-2018T18:09:43,CrimsonQuill,Maybe not...
12-12-2018T18:09:46,TerraTheWizard,& get's example clips
12-12-2018T18:09:51,TerraTheWizard,lemme find a link
12-12-2018T18:10:09,CrimsonQuill,"I just scour the movies, television and video games and string the voices together in my head."
12-12-2018T18:10:20,TerraTheWizard,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rURQYDkMOI
12-12-2018T18:10:30,CrimsonQuill,"And if they hit the right notes...my Goodness, the melody that plays is beautiful.."
12-12-2018T18:10:31,TerraTheWizard,this is the one he made for rose
12-12-2018T18:10:46,TerraTheWizard,i think i only watched the flora one he made
12-12-2018T18:10:51,CrimsonQuill,"I respect the idea, but I think I'll keep the impressions in my head."
12-12-2018T18:11:05,CrimsonQuill,"Once a voice is given, it's very hard to unthink."
12-12-2018T18:11:11,TerraTheWizard,"but i didn't stick with it after like the first 3 were the ""generic high voiced american girl"""
12-12-2018T18:11:19,CrimsonQuill,Nah....
12-12-2018T18:11:53,TerraTheWizard,"it's the dang hollywood ""movie american"" accent"
12-12-2018T18:11:56,TerraTheWizard,i hate it
12-12-2018T18:12:14,CrimsonQuill,They are a bit annoying.
12-12-2018T18:12:18,TerraTheWizard,too many characters have it
12-12-2018T18:12:27,TerraTheWizard,gimme some variety dangit
12-12-2018T18:12:29,CrimsonQuill,It's a reason I'm so picky about anime dubs.
12-12-2018T18:12:51,CrimsonQuill,"If a voice doesn't sound natural, it detract from the essence of the show."
12-12-2018T18:13:04,TerraTheWizard,i need to watch animes
12-12-2018T18:13:10,CrimsonQuill,Dragon Ball Z Kai got it's dubs spot on
12-12-2018T18:13:22,CrimsonQuill,And I want to watch Cowboy Bebop.
12-12-2018T18:13:23,TerraTheWizard,i got told to watch the sub versions
12-12-2018T18:13:36,TerraTheWizard,but ye gods why do so many of the male characters sound like little girls
12-12-2018T18:13:52,CrimsonQuill,"Saitama and Bang's voices in One Punch Man are rather good, but the others are better in the sub."
12-12-2018T18:14:17,TerraTheWizard,i think it was attack on titan i was told to watch
12-12-2018T18:14:22,CrimsonQuill,"I have never yet watched Princess Mononke in anything but the subtitles, however."
12-12-2018T18:14:33,TerraTheWizard,i got like 10 minutes into episode 1
12-12-2018T18:14:34,CrimsonQuill,There are some things that must be watched in the Sub alone.
12-12-2018T18:14:47,CrimsonQuill,I didn't stick with Attack on Titan either.
12-12-2018T18:14:53,TerraTheWizard,before i realised i couldn't tell apart the male lead & the female lead by their voices
12-12-2018T18:14:54,CrimsonQuill,And that was with the SUB
12-12-2018T18:15:08,CrimsonQuill,I just couldn't get involved...
12-12-2018T18:15:15,CrimsonQuill,"Nanbaka, on the other hand..."
12-12-2018T18:15:23,CrimsonQuill,And the Ancient Magus' Bride...
12-12-2018T18:15:34,CrimsonQuill,And Mob Psycho 100..
12-12-2018T18:15:41,CrimsonQuill,Brilliant animes.

12-12-2018T18:20:32,TerraTheWizard,dunno yet
12-12-2018T18:20:43,CrimsonQuill,Azuma? Any idea?
12-12-2018T18:21:10,TerraTheWizard,i had the beginnings of an idea but neglected to write it down
12-12-2018T18:21:12,TerraTheWizard,again
12-12-2018T18:21:23,CrimsonQuill,I know that I'm going for a Subnautica one.
12-12-2018T18:21:31,Azumachan,Mmm
12-12-2018T18:21:46,TerraTheWizard,not gonna have much chance against the festive ones
12-12-2018T18:21:53,CrimsonQuill,Probably not....
12-12-2018T18:22:02,TerraTheWizard,i'd save it for january
12-12-2018T18:22:09,CrimsonQuill,"But I made a promise, and when I make a promise, I keep it."
12-12-2018T18:22:14,Azumachan,Something involving Flora and some hugging
12-12-2018T18:22:21,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-traceflohug:
12-12-2018T18:22:22,CrimsonQuill,Sounds nice.
12-12-2018T18:22:36,CrimsonQuill,We could always see more hugs.
12-12-2018T18:22:47,Azumachan,Maybe a tiger Trace
12-12-2018T18:23:13,CrimsonQuill,Tiger Trace and Flora perhaps under the mistletoe?
12-12-2018T18:23:26,CrimsonQuill,Or snowball fighting.
12-12-2018T18:23:32,NibblyBot,New Patreon Post: Submit Sketch Suggestions (2/3) https://www.patreon.com/posts/submit-sketch-2-23318760
12-12-2018T18:23:40,Azumachan,I'm not a fan of themed Pictures
12-12-2018T18:23:53,CrimsonQuill,"Well, there's the submit ideas..."
12-12-2018T18:23:58,CrimsonQuill,Time to put mine down.
12-12-2018T18:24:15,CrimsonQuill,I'm actually rewatching the video from when my first suggestion was sketched.
12-12-2018T18:24:26,CrimsonQuill,I flipped out in surprise.
12-12-2018T18:24:40,CrimsonQuill,And it was only last month...
12-12-2018T18:24:45,Azumachan,Mmm
12-12-2018T18:24:54,Azumachan,What do you guys think of
12-12-2018T18:24:55,Azumachan,Tiger Trace and flora  sharing a passionate hug   in their bed.
12-12-2018T18:25:01,CrimsonQuill,Yes please.
12-12-2018T18:25:10,CrimsonQuill,Go for it.
12-12-2018T18:25:16,CrimsonQuill,I'll vote if I see it.
12-12-2018T18:28:39,TerraTheWizard,"doot, suggested a silly christmas one"
12-12-2018T18:29:14,CrimsonQuill,My Subnautica one is in.
12-12-2018T18:29:30,CrimsonQuill,"And with that, I must sadly say goodnight."

12-12-2018T18:31:38,Muzamai,Sooo is this where people go to chat? because I see some online members even though the stream isn't on for 5
12-12-2018T18:32:36,TerraTheWizard,people hang out here sometimes :ctwokinds-katdryer:
12-12-2018T18:33:31,tehbear,Hello
12-12-2018T18:34:02,TerraTheWizard,hey
12-12-2018T18:34:07,tehbear,have not thought up a very interesting suggestion: Snowballfight: Nat and Zen vs snowwolves.
12-12-2018T18:35:01,tehbear,but it could explain why Nat says forest wolves and snow wolves dont get along
12-12-2018T18:35:42,tehbear,maybe i will think of something better. i bet there will be a bunch of snowball fight type suggestions
12-12-2018T18:36:10,TerraTheWizard,hehe
12-12-2018T18:43:36,Muzamai,!rules
12-12-2018T18:43:45,Muzamai,?rules
12-12-2018T18:43:50,Muzamai,.rule
12-12-2018T18:43:58,Muzamai,What are the rules?
12-12-2018T18:47:00,TerraTheWizard,i think they're along the lines of:
12-12-2018T18:47:16,TerraTheWizard,-don't link stuff that could have nsfw on the site
12-12-2018T18:47:21,TerraTheWizard,-don't be a dick
12-12-2018T18:50:01,Bgrmystr2,"""Even though the stream isn't on for 5"""

12-12-2018T18:50:16,Bgrmystr2,"or sunday, even."
12-12-2018T18:55:01,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-RainezZz: time for sleep

12-12-2018T19:05:58,SpazztasticKiwi,And ‚Äúno discussing particular nsfw stuff‚Äù
12-12-2018T19:06:14,SpazztasticKiwi,?
12-12-2018T19:12:22,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-power:
12-12-2018T19:15:33,Azumachan,Too much coffee.
12-12-2018T19:16:09,Azumachan,Do you do the icons with Photoshop tom ?
12-12-2018T19:16:14,Twokinds,Yes.
12-12-2018T19:16:45,Twokinds,"Animating in Photoshop isn't the best, but it's the fastest for me to do little emotes"
12-12-2018T19:17:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Tiny loop emotes are easier that gifs
12-12-2018T19:17:41,Azumachan,The fire effect is nice. Must be long to animate that frame by frame.
12-12-2018T19:18:58,Twokinds,It took a few minutes. It's only shifting pixels around.
12-12-2018T19:19:29,Twokinds,Though it did take a little trial and error to get it to loop naturally
12-12-2018T19:21:25,RimaDraws,i animate in clip studio paint for commissions but i can't do gifs
12-12-2018T19:22:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I got a Freddy Krueger mug today
12-12-2018T19:22:39,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs beautiful
12-12-2018T19:49:56,Twokinds,Anyone read any good books lately
12-12-2018T19:50:58,Bgrmystr2,"I can't say I have, unfortunately, but I hear some people in the chat ordered books from this webcomic, and they really liked it."
12-12-2018T19:51:22,Bgrmystr2,"I don't recall the webcomic, but I'm sure it was really good :v"

12-12-2018T20:12:09,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs more YA
12-12-2018T20:12:15,SpazztasticKiwi,And romancy
12-12-2018T20:12:22,SpazztasticKiwi,But it‚Äôs fantasy
12-12-2018T20:13:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you‚Äôre more for autobiographical or realistic, there‚Äôs The Second Lap"
12-12-2018T20:14:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"And also, I rather like old"
12-12-2018T20:14:14,SpazztasticKiwi,They have taste
12-12-2018T20:16:09,RimaDraws,i can't wrap anything with qrow on my paper
12-12-2018T20:22:29,RimaDraws,he is aggravating me with this
12-12-2018T20:24:34,RimaDraws,does anyone else have this trouble
12-12-2018T21:07:05,unsteddyphoenix,Im more stuck on.
12-12-2018T21:07:13,unsteddyphoenix,How to buy gifts
12-12-2018T21:07:25,unsteddyphoenix,Whats a good mom gift. What fid yall get
12-12-2018T21:07:38,Mippy,:ctwokinds-karenOOO: I have audible. Have to figure out what to get with my next credit Got The Once and Future King last time.
12-12-2018T21:08:26,Mippy,I got my mom some fancy face cream from Sephora and some cleaning supplies....she loves cleaning
12-12-2018T21:08:33,SpazztasticKiwi,My mom‚Äôs not one for jewelry but she likes football
12-12-2018T21:09:53,SpazztasticKiwi,And lavender stuff
12-12-2018T21:10:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Dunno yet. But candles commonly work
12-12-2018T21:12:10,unsteddyphoenix,I feel like cleaning supplies...would be vaguely insulting
12-12-2018T21:12:23,unsteddyphoenix,Candles are good but ive done that one before
12-12-2018T21:13:43,SpazztasticKiwi,You could always stick a bow on yourself and cal yourself her gift
12-12-2018T21:13:55,SpazztasticKiwi,She like makeup?
12-12-2018T21:15:07,Mippy,My Mom asked for cleaning supplies :csagesaga-c1: so I‚Äôm just giving her what she wanted
12-12-2018T21:15:50,unsteddyphoenix,Im saving that one for a future girlfriend spazz
12-12-2018T21:16:03,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah! She wears it
12-12-2018T21:16:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I half expected that
12-12-2018T21:16:05,Twokinds,"With audible, do credits build up, or do they expire at the end of the month?"
12-12-2018T21:16:21,Mippy,"Dunno, just started last month"
12-12-2018T21:16:24,Twokinds,Ah
12-12-2018T21:16:28,Twokinds,I don't think I'd want to use Audible
12-12-2018T21:16:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Google says depends on plan type
12-12-2018T21:16:52,Twokinds,"Seems like I'd be way better off just buying audio books as I want them, and I'd probably end up spending less money."
12-12-2018T21:17:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Prob
12-12-2018T21:17:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause it shows a credit rollover limit on their site dependent on your plan
12-12-2018T21:18:02,Mippy,audio books are expensive in Canada. So I‚Äôd rather just pay the $14 a month for one credit. I listen while I art.
12-12-2018T21:18:41,Twokinds,But 1 per month is so little
12-12-2018T21:18:52,Twokinds,"Like, you listen to a book for 1 day, and then you're done."
12-12-2018T21:19:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"But as for the makeup, you have any idea of anything she really needs, say more eyeliner?"
12-12-2018T21:19:47,SpazztasticKiwi,How many books are you playing a month Tom
12-12-2018T21:19:54,Mippy,It is but I‚Äôm ok with that. Actually if you get a long book....The Once and Future King is like 30 hours long
12-12-2018T21:21:08,unsteddyphoenix,I...wouldnt have any clue.I dont think she really wears that much on the day-to-day. :thinking:
12-12-2018T21:21:20,unsteddyphoenix,"Like just foundation, or whatever the basic amount of makeup is"
12-12-2018T21:21:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Probably just foundation liner and mascara
12-12-2018T21:22:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Alrighty
12-12-2018T21:22:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe perfume or mother necklace
12-12-2018T21:24:55,unsteddyphoenix,mother necklace?
12-12-2018T21:24:58,unsteddyphoenix,Is that a brand?
12-12-2018T21:25:03,unsteddyphoenix,It should be i'd buy that
12-12-2018T21:25:17,SpazztasticKiwi,A necklace with ‚Äúmother‚Äù
12-12-2018T21:25:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Or ‚Äúmom‚Äù
12-12-2018T21:25:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Or maternal charm
12-12-2018T21:25:34,unsteddyphoenix,Awhh. Ok thats pretty cute actually.
12-12-2018T21:25:48,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs lovely ones around here
12-12-2018T21:26:30,Twokinds,giant sized necklace
12-12-2018T21:27:01,unsteddyphoenix,How giant?
12-12-2018T21:27:36,Mippy,"Yeah, the necklace is pretty good if your mom wears them. My mom is more of a ring person"
12-12-2018T21:27:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"They can get to be rather thumb sized but it also depends if you get a pendent, gemstone, or word"
12-12-2018T21:28:30,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs birthstone ones that include matching earrings
12-12-2018T21:29:00,Dadrobit,"I usually just go to the bookstore and find the romance novels and get the ones with the biggest chested, shirtless guys on it. Bonus if they're cowboys."
12-12-2018T21:29:28,Dadrobit,"Also, usually some kitchen related something or other that she wants."
12-12-2018T21:29:33,unsteddyphoenix,"Well thats all well and good for you, but what about yoru mother"
12-12-2018T21:29:59,Dadrobit,"Ohhhhh, I fell right into that I suppose."
12-12-2018T21:30:20,RimaDraws,hm
12-12-2018T21:30:29,RimaDraws,what'd i miss?
12-12-2018T21:31:33,unsteddyphoenix,Hmm
12-12-2018T21:31:56,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe like a rice cooker or something...
12-12-2018T21:32:02,Mippy,My mom dose not read...even if she did...she‚Äôs not the type to be into romance novels
12-12-2018T21:34:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm trying not to think of what it entails if I ever have a son and he thinks ‚Äúimma get her a beefcake romance book‚Äù
12-12-2018T21:34:51,RimaDraws,a what
12-12-2018T21:35:26,Dadrobit,"Started out as a joke like a decade ago when my mom was trying to think of a movie name and told my dad, ""You know thatmovie? The one with the male lead who had the huge chest?"""
12-12-2018T21:35:43,Dadrobit,Dad took mild offense to it.
12-12-2018T21:35:46,RimaDraws,braveheart?
12-12-2018T21:35:50,Dadrobit,We never let it go.
12-12-2018T21:35:55,Dadrobit,XXX
12-12-2018T21:36:00,RimaDraws,oooooo
12-12-2018T21:36:18,SpazztasticKiwi,That description could be a number of movies honestly
12-12-2018T21:36:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Look at Aquaman
12-12-2018T21:36:25,Dadrobit,Vin Diesel
12-12-2018T21:36:41,Dadrobit,from '02
12-12-2018T21:36:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Moms be like ‚Äúyeah I‚Äôll take you to see aquaman‚Äù
12-12-2018T21:36:48,RimaDraws,maui comes to mind lol. sorry been watching moana lately
12-12-2018T21:37:12,Dadrobit,So I just get her books with dudes with big chests.
12-12-2018T21:39:29,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/rZud5ud.jpg I will never understand why Romance Novel authors make their names so unforgivably huge on the cover.
12-12-2018T21:39:47,Dadrobit,But that was last year's selection.
12-12-2018T21:40:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Yep
12-12-2018T21:40:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Beefcake
12-12-2018T21:40:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder why the author name is like LOOK AT ME
12-12-2018T21:40:34,unsteddyphoenix,These damn books creating unrealistic expectations for men smh
12-12-2018T21:40:54,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah they're really blocking the scenery
12-12-2018T21:41:20,Dadrobit,"""Maybe if I make the font larger, it'll give me more ~exposure~."""
12-12-2018T21:41:40,unsteddyphoenix,Thats not the exposure people want t o see
12-12-2018T21:41:48,SpazztasticKiwi,You‚Äôre giving your coverboys plenty of exposure
12-12-2018T21:42:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Any lower and those pants aren‚Äôt even necessary
12-12-2018T21:43:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Although I‚Äôm not an ass girl so that might be why I find it ridiculous
12-12-2018T21:57:54,Mippy,Do you get those online...or do you actually walk up to the counter with them? :ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:
12-12-2018T21:58:49,Mippy,Because I‚Äôm assumeing you don‚Äôt look like the usual lonely middle age woman
12-12-2018T21:59:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"As weird things people buy go, the cashier isn‚Äôt gonna bat an eye at a grown man buying a few beefy novels"
12-12-2018T22:03:16,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I buy them in person."
12-12-2018T22:03:52,Dadrobit,"I will also usually buy a jar of mayo, road flares, and a stopwatch at the same time."
12-12-2018T22:03:57,Dadrobit,Just to get them thinking.
12-12-2018T22:04:30,Mippy,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
