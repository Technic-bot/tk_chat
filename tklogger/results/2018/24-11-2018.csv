24-11-2018T00:28:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I got out at 9
24-11-2018T00:28:59,SpazztasticKiwi,But power went out near end of the shift. Transformer behind the store gave up on life 💥
24-11-2018T00:45:43,RimaDraws,ooooh well out early
24-11-2018T01:27:00,Dadrobit,"Oh man, I got a DAW working and more or less optimized on this silly laptop. But God FORBID I do anything other than work in the DAW while it's open, and this rig is just not powerful enough to cope."
24-11-2018T01:27:27,Dadrobit,"Literally, I can have the DAW and one YouTube tab open."
24-11-2018T01:27:44,Dadrobit,Trying to open Picarto in another tab completely crashes the audio drivers.
24-11-2018T01:28:03,Dadrobit,And the video goes to the dogs.
24-11-2018T01:29:08,Dadrobit,Pro Tip: Never buy a laptop with mobile device cpu architecture as a backup workstation.
24-11-2018T01:29:59,Dadrobit,(I needed it a few years back rather desperately just as something to do homework on while I was in a security post)

24-11-2018T11:03:36,PalmettoPathfinder1,I'm not sure if I should do my Mistletoe kiss with Nat and Adelaide this month or wait until December.
24-11-2018T11:04:31,PalmettoPathfinder1,Also Spazz the Nibbs aren't in synch with each other. Just wanted to let you know.
24-11-2018T11:04:50,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Of course, that could be lag on my end."
24-11-2018T11:08:21,PalmettoPathfinder1,"But seriously, I need y'all's opinion: should I go ahead and do the Mistletoe request today or wait until next month?"
24-11-2018T11:13:33,PalmettoPathfinder1,Hello anyone there?

24-11-2018T11:35:28,Twokinds,I wish I could gift subs
24-11-2018T11:36:07,Twokinds,Dunno why Picarto doesn't allow this.

24-11-2018T11:50:43,Mippy,Looks like my eyes want to sleep but my body doesn’t. So I guess...good morning?
24-11-2018T11:51:41,TerraTheWizard,o/
24-11-2018T11:52:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Doesn’t making a mod give them sub-powers?
24-11-2018T11:52:37,Mippy,Nice Nyna by the way. Missed most of that because projects.

24-11-2018T12:16:09,SpazztasticKiwi,That monster Nibbly in the doodle dump tho
24-11-2018T12:17:11,RimaDraws,Gifting subs would defeat the purpose but it is a nice thought
24-11-2018T12:17:37,RimaDraws,When I’m able I’ll subscribe
24-11-2018T12:18:11,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
24-11-2018T12:18:15,Twokinds,I dunno about that
24-11-2018T12:18:27,Twokinds,If everyone could gift each other subs I think it'd encourage subs
24-11-2018T12:19:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah but wouldn’t it trigger notifications to start going to the reciever
24-11-2018T12:19:46,Twokinds,? I don't follow you.
24-11-2018T12:20:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Like on twitch
24-11-2018T12:21:00,Twokinds,I don't know Twitch
24-11-2018T12:21:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"You gift a sub, you start getting stuff from that channel"
24-11-2018T12:21:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Even if you don’t follow them
24-11-2018T12:21:22,Twokinds,I don't know. Doesn't have to.
24-11-2018T12:21:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though follow/subbing works different here, so it may actually work here instead"
24-11-2018T12:24:34,Twokinds,If I could gift subs I'd start giving them out like candy XD
24-11-2018T12:26:00,SpazztasticKiwi,sub-Oprah
24-11-2018T12:28:39,Mippy,"You get a sub, and you get a sub....dang I wish Subway deliverd"
24-11-2018T12:29:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Whatever you wanna do I guess. But that may be the reason picarto doesn’t have it
24-11-2018T12:29:24,twokindsfuturecomix,oh
24-11-2018T12:29:28,twokindsfuturecomix,i see
24-11-2018T12:29:43,Twokinds,Why? More money for Picarto.
24-11-2018T12:29:51,Twokinds,I don't see a downside.
24-11-2018T12:32:04,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-adiracoin:
24-11-2018T12:32:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"Well wouldn’t it mean that instead of someone paying for a sub, you provide it technically for free"
24-11-2018T12:33:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though that’s kinda how it is for Twitch, though they also have the bits system to add to that whole mess"
24-11-2018T12:34:00,Twokinds,"Right now, picarto gets 5% of every sub. So, every sub I give costs me 25 cents. Sure, I miss out on the other 4.75 but perhaps someone likes having the sub and then subs later. Or gives someone else a sub."
24-11-2018T12:34:36,SpazztasticKiwi,guess so
24-11-2018T12:34:57,Twokinds,I think it'd encourage people to participate more. Thus giving Picarto more revenue than they would otherwise.
24-11-2018T12:35:16,SpazztasticKiwi,But if you gave them out like candy at 25 cents a pop...
24-11-2018T12:35:43,SpazztasticKiwi,And we all know how problematic Picarto is with updates and change
24-11-2018T12:35:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I wouldn’t be opposed. Not sure if many would
24-11-2018T12:35:59,Twokinds,Heheh
24-11-2018T12:36:16,Twokinds,It's just a thought. I think I'll try bringing the idea up with Picarto.
24-11-2018T12:36:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"But if you want to jump in that shark tank to convince them, be my guest"
24-11-2018T12:36:49,SpazztasticKiwi,And record their reaction
24-11-2018T12:38:34,twokindsfuturecomix,yez plz

24-11-2018T19:21:21,TerraTheWizard,i don't know halo
24-11-2018T19:21:22,Dadrobit,Trace is Cortana. He's... blue at least?
24-11-2018T19:21:25,js199456,so Red goes Rogue then?
24-11-2018T19:21:25,ProsePro7,I just did in my head and for some reason the attack on Titan theme interupted it
24-11-2018T19:21:39,unsteddyphoenix,And also psychopathic!
24-11-2018T19:21:45,CrimsonQuill,"No, Isabella from Halo Wars 2 is coloured redm but is loyal."

24-11-2018T19:22:18,HeresyArtStream,I imagine Kat being Cortana. She does the whole walk around half naked thing. :P
24-11-2018T19:22:24,CrimsonQuill,And this Spartan...she's ready for battle.
24-11-2018T19:22:32,Vexd,"Raine, the only Spartan with a her smile and optimism still intact"
24-11-2018T19:22:32,Dadrobit,I literally know nothing about Halo beyond the first.
24-11-2018T19:22:32,CrimsonQuill,Only Cortana can be Cortana though.
24-11-2018T19:22:39,RimaDraws,raine is the new master chief

24-11-2018T19:23:32,BadFoMo,@CrimsonQuill That's what I'm thinking.
24-11-2018T19:23:40,CrimsonQuill,I imagine her taking orders from UNSC Infinity.
24-11-2018T19:23:52,Dadrobit,"Wait, what if Cortana is just human Raine?"
24-11-2018T19:23:58,js199456,UNSC Nora XD

24-11-2018T19:24:19,Bespin,get her away from anything forerunner
24-11-2018T19:24:19,BadFoMo,@Dadrobit ...That could work too.

24-11-2018T19:24:46,CrimsonQuill,"No, Cortana Halo 4 had the best writing in the series."
24-11-2018T19:24:53,CrimsonQuill,Halo 4 is my personal favourite.

24-11-2018T19:25:06,CrimsonHelsing,evil Cortana? last I recalled she was merely going insane in 4
24-11-2018T19:25:07,Bespin,Reach is best
24-11-2018T19:25:15,js199456,they made it clear that human covenant war was bound to end
24-11-2018T19:25:15,Bespin,"No argue,ent"
24-11-2018T19:25:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,reach is really good

24-11-2018T19:25:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,some of my best gaming memories are from halo
24-11-2018T19:26:03,Bespin,I probably have 2k hours in reach
24-11-2018T19:26:05,Bespin,lol
24-11-2018T19:26:11,ProsePro7,Tom have her talking to Cortana but make it Fem Wolf Red instead.

24-11-2018T19:26:31,Mippy,Join the brotherhood Soap
24-11-2018T19:26:35,js199456,I only played the Story mode in Halo (not interested in the multiplayer in that game)
24-11-2018T19:26:37,TerraTheWizard,"i played some of the first halo, when it was a store display"
24-11-2018T19:26:42,TerraTheWizard,that's it
24-11-2018T19:26:42,CatzArt,Halo is a great series minus Halo 5
24-11-2018T19:26:51,Bespin,I hope infinite is good
24-11-2018T19:26:52,Bgrmystr2,4's not any better though
24-11-2018T19:26:54,ProsePro7,Who's Cortana gonna be?

24-11-2018T19:27:08,Bgrmystr2,The suggestion already said it is gonna be red
24-11-2018T19:27:11,CrimsonQuill,Let's see.
24-11-2018T19:27:12,CatzArt,halo 4 was okay enough not like the main trilogy odst or reach
24-11-2018T19:27:15,ShadowSoap,"I grew up with Pokemon, then CoD"
24-11-2018T19:27:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"infinite has the good original art style, so I have some hopes"

24-11-2018T20:27:23,Mippy,The start of a beautiful friendship
24-11-2018T20:27:25,BadFoMo,What happened to his ear?
24-11-2018T20:27:30,unsteddyphoenix,Got nommed
24-11-2018T20:27:32,MrMongMong,Red is now a female Keidrian being hit on.

24-11-2018T20:28:22,BadFoMo,4?
24-11-2018T20:28:27,SageSaga,Hmm- question- would y'all buy a 140 page comic book for 30 bucks?
24-11-2018T20:28:29,Combak,... Or did I miss some at the start?
24-11-2018T20:28:32,ThingsAreMoving,"Michelle is the best fox, prove me wrong"
24-11-2018T20:28:44,ProsePro7,What book is it?
24-11-2018T20:28:45,Tharkis,@SageSaga i have frequently =D
24-11-2018T20:28:46,Dadrobit,"That's a boatload of ""it depends"" Sage."
24-11-2018T20:28:46,MrMongMong,Mike is better.
24-11-2018T20:28:47,unsteddyphoenix,That...seems reasonable?
24-11-2018T20:28:50,Mippy,That’s about average in Canada Sage
24-11-2018T20:28:50,Combak,Probably not Sage?
24-11-2018T20:28:57,ShadowSoap,Edge Warning
24-11-2018T20:28:59,MrMongMong,"And, this is sad..."
24-11-2018T20:29:00,LOGANWOLF,LOL
24-11-2018T20:29:09,BadFoMo,I like it.
24-11-2018T20:29:14,SageSaga,its looking like the cost for my book printing will be 15+ per book
24-11-2018T20:29:18,Bgrmystr2,"I don't know how thick of a book that'd be, sage, but that seems like a lot."
24-11-2018T20:29:19,Mippy,SAD TRACE :ctwokinds-sadtrace2:
24-11-2018T20:29:32,totallynotTrace,NOOOOOO
24-11-2018T20:29:36,SageSaga,so i would have to sell them for 30 to make a profit- even thats a low profit margin
24-11-2018T20:29:47,ProsePro7,I wont pay 30 for DC Marvel garbage but sure for 140 pages that doesnt sound bad
24-11-2018T20:29:49,totallynotTrace,:broken_heart:

24-11-2018T20:33:57,Bgrmystr2,that's legit cool
24-11-2018T20:34:00,Dadrobit,"Dunno, someone else handles the costs. Usually we just use them for bartering and trade."
24-11-2018T20:34:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Thats hype
24-11-2018T20:34:13,AyeYoItsMateo,is that it
24-11-2018T20:34:17,AyeYoItsMateo,:(
24-11-2018T20:34:36,Mippy,"Yeah, that’s pretty cool Dad"

24-11-2018T20:36:29,AndrERaudsep20,I woke up for this live stream at 3.30am andat end of the stream i am here.      *****
24-11-2018T20:36:44,Dadrobit,"And by make money, I mean ""drops in the bucket against our massive operational costs deficit"""
24-11-2018T20:37:00,SageSaga,yeah im going to be printing AI
24-11-2018T20:37:07,Dadrobit,Grats Sage!

24-11-2018T20:38:17,SageSaga,im trying to find a cheaper printing solution with good quality
24-11-2018T20:39:13,RimaDraws,have you thought to publish on kindle e books?
24-11-2018T20:39:43,RimaDraws,just a thought not that i wouldn't mind a actual hard copy
24-11-2018T20:39:53,Bgrmystr2,"for all that, people can just go read the comic on the website for free.."
24-11-2018T20:40:01,Bgrmystr2,the whole idea of printing books is to have a physical copy
24-11-2018T20:40:09,RimaDraws,yea sorry it was just a suggestion..
24-11-2018T20:40:27,Bgrmystr2,it works for most books because they don't have a version digitally.
24-11-2018T20:40:41,Bgrmystr2,webcomics are different though
24-11-2018T20:40:45,RimaDraws,sorry for saying something

24-11-2018T20:42:09,Dadrobit,o/ Mvilu
24-11-2018T20:43:05,Mippy,You don’t have to take everything so personally Rima. Bgr was not attacking you
24-11-2018T20:43:28,RimaDraws,im only saying it could be cheaper. i mean thats how i would do it since i may not be able to afford printing costs
24-11-2018T20:44:08,RimaDraws,its just a suggestion
24-11-2018T20:46:33,MallardDuckAvia,Why did the stream end?
24-11-2018T20:46:39,Bgrmystr2,cuz it's over?
24-11-2018T20:46:44,RimaDraws,because hes done for today
24-11-2018T20:46:46,RimaDraws,thats why
24-11-2018T20:46:47,Bgrmystr2,hew drew all 7 suggestions.

24-11-2018T20:47:10,MallardDuckAvia,I missed the first several then
24-11-2018T20:47:19,MallardDuckAvia,I thought he was on 5
24-11-2018T20:47:24,Bgrmystr2,"Also, I don't see the purpose of having to pay for an ebook / ebook app to read the comic digitally when you can just go to the katbox."
24-11-2018T20:47:38,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-reniderp:
24-11-2018T20:47:47,Bgrmystr2,"yeh he did the recap and showed all 7, you can see the rest of the stream that you missed"

24-11-2018T20:51:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I like the salt

24-11-2018T20:56:15,Bgrmystr2,lol yeah marv being one of the salt shakers
24-11-2018T20:57:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'm like one of those salt containers with the little metal ramp

24-11-2018T21:21:29,RimaDraws,i got time to think of a holiday suggestion
24-11-2018T21:21:33,RimaDraws,not quite sure what tho
24-11-2018T21:24:02,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floAAA:
24-11-2018T21:25:17,Twokinds,Yes! Can't wait for Holiday suggestions once again :D
24-11-2018T21:25:20,RimaDraws,so i found a box of disney puzzles at walmart and i may put them together and glue them later
24-11-2018T21:25:50,RimaDraws,i kinda almost went for something harry potter themed again but nothing good winter there
24-11-2018T21:26:08,RimaDraws,unless you count trace flora and keith in gryffindor robes and scarf
24-11-2018T21:26:26,Twokinds,Could do!
24-11-2018T21:26:31,Twokinds,Who would be in which house?
24-11-2018T21:26:45,RimaDraws,honestly i see them as harry ron and hermoine
24-11-2018T21:27:05,RimaDraws,i had kinda thought it while watching the goblet of fire
24-11-2018T21:27:07,Twokinds,That's fair
24-11-2018T21:27:21,Bgrmystr2,Trace would easily go into Gryffindor but would be very fitting in Slytherin..
24-11-2018T21:27:30,Bgrmystr2,ironic..
24-11-2018T21:27:33,RimaDraws,hence why i see him as harry
24-11-2018T21:27:42,Bgrmystr2,I guess main characters are kinda similar.
24-11-2018T21:27:47,RimaDraws,they are
24-11-2018T21:27:49,RimaDraws,in a way
24-11-2018T21:27:56,RimaDraws,i have given it some thought being the nerd i am
24-11-2018T21:28:44,RimaDraws,though id love to see rose mcgonagall again and clovis as snape or voldemort
24-11-2018T21:29:07,Ordithus,Neutral could be Voldie
24-11-2018T21:29:18,RimaDraws,ooh
24-11-2018T21:29:37,Twokinds,They both have no nose!

24-11-2018T21:50:59,RimaDraws,it was cheaper than a wacom and only $500 for a 21.5
24-11-2018T21:51:19,Vatruvius,"Yeah, I am quite hsppy with it. Spent a fair amount of time doing research and it just seemed to have all the important things for a semi-affordable price."
24-11-2018T21:51:45,RimaDraws,huion is a good brand
24-11-2018T21:51:54,RimaDraws,and affordable

24-11-2018T23:19:06,RimaDraws,the one asking peoples age
24-11-2018T23:19:10,Vatruvius,Clearly I missed something...
24-11-2018T23:19:45,SpazztasticKiwi,He was asking if we knew what discord was
24-11-2018T23:19:48,SpazztasticKiwi,And asking if we knew what discord was
24-11-2018T23:19:53,SpazztasticKiwi,And asking if we knew what discord was
24-11-2018T23:20:00,Ordithus,Ick
24-11-2018T23:20:04,SpazztasticKiwi,And if we could give him game suggestions
24-11-2018T23:20:17,Ordithus,Do you have a name?
24-11-2018T23:20:18,SpazztasticKiwi,And if Terra in particular would tell her name
24-11-2018T23:20:36,RimaDraws,oh yea him. i can't remember the name
24-11-2018T23:20:40,RimaDraws,didn't it have trace in it
24-11-2018T23:20:56,SpazztasticKiwi,It was twokindsfuturecomics I believe
24-11-2018T23:21:08,RimaDraws,yes
24-11-2018T23:21:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Something along those lines
24-11-2018T23:21:13,RimaDraws,i remember
24-11-2018T23:21:14,Ordithus,Looks like he's already banned
24-11-2018T23:21:25,Bgrmystr2,oh wow was he already banned haha
24-11-2018T23:21:29,Bgrmystr2,shadowban much
24-11-2018T23:21:46,Bgrmystr2,was prolly tom
24-11-2018T23:22:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Well I guess someone got him while I was messing with the time clock
24-11-2018T23:22:02,Bgrmystr2,he was in the chat not too long after the guy stopped talking
24-11-2018T23:22:31,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl: good job Tom
24-11-2018T23:22:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Since power went out my work punches were screwy so I got distracted
24-11-2018T23:22:53,SpazztasticKiwi,But that’s good
24-11-2018T23:27:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I figured maybe Tom was still there but he’d gone quiet so it was also possible he’d walked off for a bit
24-11-2018T23:28:23,SpazztasticKiwi,So I threw a holler at Steggy to pop over. Since I don’t have a discord or any connection to Ord or Sage
24-11-2018T23:30:27,Ordithus,"I've been pretty busy lately.  Between work, moving, and visiting my family for Thanksgiving"
24-11-2018T23:30:31,Ordithus,I haven't been around much
24-11-2018T23:31:10,SpazztasticKiwi,:ptv-uneasy:I know
24-11-2018T23:31:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"But I guess with the mods we got, that’s what we get"
24-11-2018T23:31:43,SpazztasticKiwi,And Tom got ‘em anyway so
24-11-2018T23:31:45,unsteddyphoenix,Oi. Rude.

24-11-2018T23:35:31,Bgrmystr2,There was an attempt :star:
24-11-2018T23:35:34,Dadrobit,"Ah, yeah. We did have another 13 year old."
24-11-2018T23:35:43,Dadrobit,Was annoying. Frankly. A cunt.
24-11-2018T23:35:47,unsteddyphoenix,Yaaay~ \o/
24-11-2018T23:35:52,unsteddyphoenix,What 13 year old isnt
24-11-2018T23:36:05,Dadrobit,Can't say I wasn't.
24-11-2018T23:36:09,Dadrobit,Kinda
24-11-2018T23:36:22,Dadrobit,Took me until I was 14-15
24-11-2018T23:36:30,Dadrobit,To become cuntish
24-11-2018T23:36:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"They grow up so fast..,"
24-11-2018T23:36:55,Dadrobit,I think I decuntified myself rather nicely.
24-11-2018T23:37:21,Dadrobit,"Now I'm a cunt, but ironically."
24-11-2018T23:37:27,SpazztasticKiwi,What got me was how fast he got all puffed up like an old mama hen
24-11-2018T23:37:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean
24-11-2018T23:37:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I thought ~I~ was hormonal
24-11-2018T23:37:59,unsteddyphoenix,Ironic cunt. Same.
24-11-2018T23:38:04,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
24-11-2018T23:38:05,Dadrobit,"Yeah, he called Mippy a fucker out of the blue and then just kinda exploded."
24-11-2018T23:38:53,Dadrobit,When we pointed out for the umpteenth time that self promotion is not accepted. And that he didn't know the definition of self promotion.
24-11-2018T23:39:08,Bgrmystr2,"I don't think it was out of nowhere, just anger from before for telling him he's not why we're here"
24-11-2018T23:39:20,Bgrmystr2,he was just too stuck on it
24-11-2018T23:40:01,Dadrobit,"But, bgr... How do I show you all what's on my computer?"
24-11-2018T23:40:42,Bgrmystr2,LOL
24-11-2018T23:40:45,Vatruvius,"""Who do uou think I am!? Tom created this whole thing 15 years ago just for ME!"""
24-11-2018T23:41:50,Dadrobit,"I'd make a snide sarcastic remark about requiring other people to give me suggestions for what to draw because I'm completely creatively bankrupt, but I don't want that to be mistaken out of context as shade towards Tom."
24-11-2018T23:42:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Right along the lines of “Do you know who my father is?!?”
24-11-2018T23:42:11,SpazztasticKiwi,In which case I’d reply “Didn’t your mom tell you?”
24-11-2018T23:42:22,Bgrmystr2,"it was literally just... ""You guys should tell ME your real name, and join MY discord voice chat and look at MY computer screenshare. Why? Because ME."""
24-11-2018T23:42:39,Bgrmystr2,literally what his messages were.
24-11-2018T23:42:42,Bgrmystr2,the whole thing.
24-11-2018T23:42:45,Bgrmystr2,was one of those.
24-11-2018T23:42:50,SpazztasticKiwi,In a nutshell
24-11-2018T23:43:06,Bgrmystr2,It was dumb
24-11-2018T23:43:11,Bgrmystr2,but he's gone now.
24-11-2018T23:43:16,Bgrmystr2,so we're safe again.
24-11-2018T23:43:16,Ordithus,Wow
24-11-2018T23:43:28,Bgrmystr2,he was super attached to Terra.
24-11-2018T23:43:31,Bgrmystr2,for some reason
24-11-2018T23:43:32,Dadrobit,Culyer by the way. His name was Culyer.
24-11-2018T23:43:33,Ordithus,Can I ban him too?
24-11-2018T23:43:34,SpazztasticKiwi,See the kind of “fun” you miss
24-11-2018T23:43:37,Bgrmystr2,hahaha
24-11-2018T23:43:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah that’s another thing
24-11-2018T23:43:55,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, you can unban him and ban him again, Ord, but"
24-11-2018T23:43:59,Bgrmystr2,he's already banned so..
24-11-2018T23:44:02,Ordithus,Seems risky
24-11-2018T23:44:05,SpazztasticKiwi,What the hell kinda name is that
24-11-2018T23:44:07,Bgrmystr2,yeah
24-11-2018T23:44:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Didn’t he call Mip a dick too
24-11-2018T23:44:42,Dadrobit,"I think he just called Mippy a ""fucker"""
24-11-2018T23:44:54,Dadrobit,Maybe dick was in there too?
24-11-2018T23:45:01,Dadrobit,Lots of names in this chat.
24-11-2018T23:45:03,Bgrmystr2,"maybe, don't recall"
24-11-2018T23:45:15,Bgrmystr2,"If I were awake, he wouldn't have liked me heh"
24-11-2018T23:45:15,Dadrobit,Like River Jazz Hermina
24-11-2018T23:45:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Basically everyone “adult” name his wee teen brain could think of
24-11-2018T23:45:38,Bgrmystr2,"but I was asleep the whole time, saw it after I woke up unfortunately"
24-11-2018T23:45:54,Dadrobit,I wonder what happened to RedDeath2018?
24-11-2018T23:45:58,Twokinds,"Yeah, he stopped talking because I shadowbanned him."
24-11-2018T23:46:05,Dadrobit,"Ah, good shit."
24-11-2018T23:46:10,Twokinds,But I didn't say anything because it's better to just leave them yelling at no one.
24-11-2018T23:46:13,Vatruvius,Why don't we look at the philosophical/psychological side of all this while we are at it. XD
24-11-2018T23:46:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Ironically enough he never snapped at me even though I suggested his density was somewhere around “black hole”
24-11-2018T23:46:54,Dadrobit,He's the supermassive black hole at the center of his own universe.
24-11-2018T23:46:59,Ordithus,"Robit, he was banned at some point"
24-11-2018T23:47:07,Dadrobit,Really?
24-11-2018T23:47:33,Ordithus,"Yeah, either Tom, Sage, or unsteddy did it.  After he was kicked a few times..."
24-11-2018T23:47:39,SpazztasticKiwi,So RedDeath is also banned?
24-11-2018T23:47:55,unsteddyphoenix,I...think I did it?
24-11-2018T23:47:58,Ordithus,Oorrr.. maybe not?
24-11-2018T23:48:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Oooooooo
24-11-2018T23:48:00,unsteddyphoenix,I shadowbanned one person at least
24-11-2018T23:48:01,Dadrobit,"I recall a few 13 year old bans, like I think DragonWIP was one of them?"
24-11-2018T23:48:22,Dadrobit,And now I believe that's now FazeFury?
24-11-2018T23:48:24,Ordithus,Not in the ban list.  I wonder if they changed name
24-11-2018T23:48:25,unsteddyphoenix,I forget his name. And yeah I didnt say anything 'cause yelling into the wind is better
24-11-2018T23:48:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I thought he was also “Crimson”somethingorother
24-11-2018T23:48:57,Ordithus,That's Alucard
24-11-2018T23:49:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Actually I think he’s revealed he has like 3 or 4 different accounts
24-11-2018T23:49:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Who
24-11-2018T23:50:09,Ordithus,hellsing ultimate abridged reference
24-11-2018T23:50:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh
24-11-2018T23:50:25,Dadrobit,"Ah, the Crimson Fucker"
24-11-2018T23:50:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah that reference missed
24-11-2018T23:50:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Now now Dadro
24-11-2018T23:50:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I fallow him on twitter
24-11-2018T23:50:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,fallow?
24-11-2018T23:50:58,Dadrobit,Letting farmland set alone to recover?
24-11-2018T23:50:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Let’s not get...too on the nose
24-11-2018T23:51:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m gonna pop in a movie real quick
24-11-2018T23:52:04,Vatruvius,How does one squeeze in a movie that is at least an hour real quick?
24-11-2018T23:52:13,Vatruvius,Or am I taking this way too literally?
24-11-2018T23:52:16,Vatruvius,Probably am...
24-11-2018T23:52:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe
24-11-2018T23:52:22,Dadrobit,1.25x speed
24-11-2018T23:52:27,Dadrobit,Still watchable
24-11-2018T23:52:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I could answer by saying I’ve seen it enough I could probably lip sync to it
24-11-2018T23:52:48,Vatruvius,But then it is only about 45 minutes at least so...
24-11-2018T23:53:17,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s an hour and 38 minutes long
24-11-2018T23:53:25,Vatruvius,My sister has done that with Pride & Prejudice.
24-11-2018T23:53:34,Dadrobit,The Fifth Element
24-11-2018T23:53:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Not Fifth Element no
24-11-2018T23:54:02,SpazztasticKiwi,But I have seen that
24-11-2018T23:54:07,Ordithus,There was a time when I could almost lip sync Gladiator.
24-11-2018T23:54:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I know the main actress well
24-11-2018T23:54:13,Ordithus,It was a rather boring summer
24-11-2018T23:54:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Or her work that is
24-11-2018T23:54:18,Dadrobit,"Was just saying, I know that movie very well."
24-11-2018T23:54:20,Vatruvius,lol
24-11-2018T23:55:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Milla Jovovich is also Resident Evil’s “Alice”. Only way I know her or Fifth Element
