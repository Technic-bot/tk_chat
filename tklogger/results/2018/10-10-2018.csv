10-10-2018T09:27:09,Xexanoth,you're gone for 5 mins and suddenly everthing is on fire
10-10-2018T10:24:45,Twokinds,Sounds about right.

10-10-2018T14:12:25,Xexanoth,that would explain all the fires XD
10-10-2018T14:22:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom, you back in the swing of things yet"
10-10-2018T14:27:19,Twokinds,I'm actually in a lot of pain
10-10-2018T14:27:47,Twokinds,I got a neck crick that's started spreading all through my shoulder and down my arm.
10-10-2018T14:28:07,Mippy,:ctwokinds-LauraCry: I feel you man
10-10-2018T14:28:36,Mippy,Yikes
10-10-2018T14:37:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Jesus
10-10-2018T14:37:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"Not sure if you slept wrong, need a massage, or could use a heat pad"
10-10-2018T14:38:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though if I could make a joke, aren‚Äôt artists always supposed to be in pain"
10-10-2018T14:46:17,Mippy,:ctwokinds-sleepoverA::ctwokinds-sleepoverB:
10-10-2018T14:53:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Now there‚Äôs an artist
10-10-2018T14:56:46,Twokinds,This wasabi is so disappointing. I can't tell if I've gotten desensitized or if this batch is particularly weak.
10-10-2018T15:07:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Isn‚Äôt all American wasabi supposed to be fake
10-10-2018T15:08:42,Twokinds,"Oh yeah, it's definitely 'fake' wasabi"
10-10-2018T15:09:02,Twokinds,But this one is bad.
10-10-2018T15:09:28,Twokinds,Doesn't hurt to eat at all.
10-10-2018T15:09:39,SpazztasticKiwi,You found bad fake wasabi. Good job
10-10-2018T15:10:05,Twokinds,I don't care if wasabi is fake as long as it burns good.
10-10-2018T15:11:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Great
10-10-2018T15:11:22,SpazztasticKiwi,A masochist
10-10-2018T15:14:54,Twokinds,lol
10-10-2018T15:16:57,SpazztasticKiwi,That mean you snack on ghost peppers like they‚Äôre popcorn?
10-10-2018T15:19:51,Twokinds,Certainly not.
10-10-2018T15:27:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Chicken
10-10-2018T15:28:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Thought you lived for the burn
10-10-2018T15:28:31,Twokinds,I prioritize tasting good
10-10-2018T15:28:41,Twokinds,ghost peppers don't taste good.
10-10-2018T15:29:04,SpazztasticKiwi,You‚Äôve actually tried one?
10-10-2018T15:35:13,Mippy,I‚Äôm tempted to pick up a ghost pepper hot sauce at my local co op every time I go. I never do...
10-10-2018T15:36:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not a spicy fan
10-10-2018T15:42:51,Twokinds,"I've tried ghost pepper hot sauce, but not the actual peppers."
10-10-2018T15:48:18,Mippy,Love spice...now gotta draw some eggs
10-10-2018T16:04:33,iliar,Pistachio ice cream and wasabi. Perfect crime. https://cs.pikabu.ru/post_img/big/2013/07/07/10/1373210057_1441519527.jpg

10-10-2018T16:05:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Who eats pistachio ice cream
10-10-2018T16:05:30,Xexanoth,tom would just be: Finally some good fucking ice cream!
10-10-2018T16:05:55,SpazztasticKiwi,There is a shop called something like ‚ÄúDiablo ice cream‚Äù
10-10-2018T16:06:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Ice cream made with hot peppers
10-10-2018T16:06:11,SpazztasticKiwi,And hot sauce
10-10-2018T16:59:06,SpazztasticKiwi,The Aldwych Cafe. Sells ‚ÄúRespiro Del Diavolo‚Äù made with hot peppers in Scotland
10-10-2018T17:02:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Speaking of food though I‚Äôm getting something
10-10-2018T17:14:50,Bgrmystr2,"sucks when I wake up and ""an error occurred reconnecting"" spams my chat for 40 hours"
10-10-2018T17:15:00,Bgrmystr2,so I don't know what happened while I was gone.
10-10-2018T17:25:24,Xexanoth,mostly talking about spicy food
10-10-2018T17:28:07,SpazztasticKiwi,And everything was on fire cause Tom walked off for 5 minutes
10-10-2018T17:30:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"One meatball and a veggie sub later, and I‚Äôm back"
10-10-2018T17:31:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Still cold
10-10-2018T17:35:46,Mippy,Is trying to shadow but shadow dose not want to happen :ctwokinds-flomad:
10-10-2018T17:40:47,Bgrmystr2,"see, I missed it"
10-10-2018T17:59:28,SpazztasticKiwi,The shadow is hiding in the shadows
10-10-2018T17:59:39,SpazztasticKiwi,ü•Å
10-10-2018T18:03:23,Dadrobit,"Nah, it's just obviously High Noon."
10-10-2018T18:03:32,Dadrobit,"Look out, Matt Mercer may be nearby."
10-10-2018T18:06:41,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs evening
10-10-2018T18:09:50,unsteddyphoenix,No it's high noon
10-10-2018T18:13:48,SpazztasticKiwi,It is 6:13
10-10-2018T18:14:42,unsteddyphoenix,I reject your timezone and substitute my own
10-10-2018T18:29:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I reject your rejection
10-10-2018T18:30:25,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-karenOOO: Fight fight fight!
10-10-2018T18:31:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a meatball marinara sub. Your argument is invalid
10-10-2018T18:33:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"Speaking of which, Bagheera approves of"
10-10-2018T19:00:14,Dadrobit,Not sure what I want to cook honestly.
10-10-2018T19:49:49,Dadrobit,"Which if Sneaky was on something utility based like Ashe while Jensen/Licorice were on carries, I'd kinda understand not giving him all of the ganks. But that draft was almost 100% Sneaky is our win condition."
10-10-2018T19:49:58,Dadrobit,le sigh
10-10-2018T20:33:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Uh
10-10-2018T20:33:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Wat
10-10-2018T20:34:02,Bgrmystr2,"whisper fail, obv"
10-10-2018T20:40:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Wonder if Tom‚Äôs still feeling that crick

10-10-2018T20:58:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera has managed to split a nail. Not vet worthy for now but I wonder how long it‚Äôs been that way
10-10-2018T21:00:03,Twokinds,"Neck is less painful, but still sore. Hopefully, I won't have as much trouble sleeping tonight."
10-10-2018T21:00:21,Twokinds,"Speaking of which, I'm going to sleep"
10-10-2018T21:00:29,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:

10-10-2018T21:03:58,Dadrobit,Sip some NyQuil and may the odds be ever in your favor for a good night's sleep.
10-10-2018T21:04:26,unsteddyphoenix,its a gamble every time
10-10-2018T21:13:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Better advice: don‚Äôt sleep like a pretzel
10-10-2018T21:17:40,Dadrobit,"Ohhhhhhh, if only I knew how to mod, I could make that happen."
10-10-2018T21:19:56,Dadrobit,It's a very elaborate puzzle
10-10-2018T21:40:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"Woke up with a stiff neck, going to bed early...think tom might be feeling his age"
10-10-2018T21:42:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Or the two weeks of being essentially a full day ahead of everyone
