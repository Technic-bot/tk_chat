11-06-2018T02:10:30,Trevuxnouxe,g'night!
11-06-2018T10:02:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Well I looked at the cat bow ties. None really looked good
11-06-2018T10:05:55,SpazztasticKiwi,And I had an interesting experience with the cashier
11-06-2018T10:25:56,Twokinds,cat bowtie?
11-06-2018T10:27:53,SpazztasticKiwi,For Bagheera
11-06-2018T10:28:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Not like dressing him up in a little suit or anything. Just a tiny clip on bow tie thing
11-06-2018T10:29:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Only thing they had was a collar/cuff links set.
11-06-2018T10:49:05,Twokinds,lol
11-06-2018T10:49:06,Twokinds,Cute
11-06-2018T10:56:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah but he has tiny feets. The links were a bit big
11-06-2018T10:56:57,Twokinds,Aw
11-06-2018T10:57:17,Xexanoth,"Just buy him fake Cat Ears, to go with his real ones"
11-06-2018T10:58:13,SpazztasticKiwi,And he‚Äôs never worn anything on his feet before. I imagine he‚Äôd walk funny like those videos of dogs experiencing booties for the first time
11-06-2018T11:01:12,Xexanoth,"well, cuffs are only on the legs, the problem with boots is that they are on the paws"
11-06-2018T11:02:10,SpazztasticKiwi,He‚Äôs gotten tape on his foot before and didn‚Äôt like it
11-06-2018T11:03:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt want to put something on him that he doesn‚Äôt like
11-06-2018T11:03:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Or makes him uncomfortable
11-06-2018T11:06:09,Twokinds,I like putting sticky notes on Holly.
11-06-2018T11:06:28,SpazztasticKiwi,You‚Äôre just mean
11-06-2018T11:06:39,Twokinds,"""Cat"""
11-06-2018T11:07:56,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúCat‚Äù?
11-06-2018T11:08:15,Twokinds,That's what I write on the sticky note.
11-06-2018T11:08:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Very accurate
11-06-2018T11:08:56,Xexanoth,"For extra Fun, use a ballon and static eletricity to make it cling to the cat"
11-06-2018T11:09:15,SpazztasticKiwi,My dad did that once to his cat before I think
11-06-2018T11:09:28,SpazztasticKiwi,But it was one of those labeling machines
11-06-2018T11:09:34,SpazztasticKiwi,*with
11-06-2018T11:10:02,iliar,It looks like you are afraid that you will forget that Holly is s cat.
11-06-2018T11:10:23,SpazztasticKiwi,His allergies will remind him if his mind fails

11-06-2018T11:15:53,SpazztasticKiwi,About the same size Kiwi is though her growth was stunted so she‚Äôs shorter

11-06-2018T12:09:47,MuonNeutrino,who knows
11-06-2018T12:09:54,MuonNeutrino,"euchre is even older, he's supposedly 28"
11-06-2018T12:09:56,qwe304,@Bgrmystr2 just scroll up and down quickly
11-06-2018T12:10:40,BadFoMo,"I'm here. Also, Blast this new update starting the stream muted!"

11-06-2018T12:11:29,Bgrmystr2,that's not an experience
11-06-2018T12:11:30,MuonNeutrino,"i'm really looking forward to seeing the dialogue on this one; trace and rose haven't really had a chance to talk yet, and there's lots of interesting possibilities there"
11-06-2018T12:12:04,WanderingUnicorn,"I agree, she's going to have a lot to process"
11-06-2018T12:12:09,MuonNeutrino,"rose obviously has noticed how different trace is, but she doesn't know the story, and meanwhile rose is one of very few people who knew trace personally before he went insane"
11-06-2018T12:12:35,MuonNeutrino,so she could have interesting things to tell him about his past
11-06-2018T12:12:37,WanderingUnicorn,"Wow, insanity..."
11-06-2018T12:12:45,kts,and tjis can open many path for the story to go on

11-06-2018T12:14:08,WanderingUnicorn,So was old Trace a psychopath or a sociopath?
11-06-2018T12:14:21,MuonNeutrino,i dunno the technical implications of the terms
11-06-2018T12:14:29,MuonNeutrino,"'messed up' is how i'd put it, either way XD"

11-06-2018T13:15:58,HeresyArtStream,"Although I also wanted Krystal to be added and she's just an assist trophy. Better than nothing, I guess."

11-06-2018T13:16:21,Matth3w23,Depends what you define a furry as cheese
11-06-2018T13:16:24,CheeseRS,"Also, how do I tell her that I am attracted to some, if not most anthropomorphic animals?"

11-06-2018T13:18:54,Bgrmystr2,it's not complicated cheese. it's just animals that have human-defining traits. what we find attractive on humans people fit into animals. it's generally understandable

11-06-2018T13:27:19,Matth3w23,"Yeah I know, which is why I wasn't so keen on that one either"
11-06-2018T13:27:25,HeresyArtStream,Now he's a stupid idea: Jurassic World 3-- Ingen wanted to branch out beyond just dinosaurs because they wanted to make other parks
11-06-2018T13:27:26,HeresyArtStream,so they genetically engineered a dragon.
11-06-2018T13:27:29,HeresyArtStream,:V
11-06-2018T13:27:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,hopefully better Spot

11-06-2018T13:27:56,HeresyArtStream,I know that's why it's a dumb idea :V
11-06-2018T13:27:57,CheeseRS,Hey Grish!
11-06-2018T13:28:03,SpotTheLeopard,"...I'd still be for that, Heresy"

11-06-2018T13:28:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Why do people go for the T. rex? The Gigantosaurus was bigger
11-06-2018T13:28:12,Dadrobit,No spoilers for Infinity War pls
11-06-2018T13:28:17,HeresyArtStream,just because an idea is dumb doesn't make it fun though

11-06-2018T13:28:38,totallynotTrace,impretty sure if you just give a t rex wings and a way to breath fire you now have a plausible dragon
11-06-2018T13:28:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,because Rexy is a childhood hero kiwi
11-06-2018T13:28:53,HeresyArtStream,Infinity War spoiler: Batman dies :o
11-06-2018T13:28:53,Xexanoth,there seriously should be a law that forbids you from playing trailers for movies until they're like 2 or 3 months away from release
11-06-2018T13:28:59,Bgrmystr2,Heresy pls
11-06-2018T13:29:04,Mippy,Every Jurassic park since the first one has been a stupid idea...still entertaining though

11-06-2018T13:29:25,BadFoMo,@HeresyArtStream Dumbildor Dies?
11-06-2018T13:29:33,HeresyArtStream,I hold to i that Jurassic Park 3 was better than Lost World though.
11-06-2018T13:29:39,Xexanoth,"Jurrassic world was a solid ""meh"" though"
11-06-2018T13:29:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,^
11-06-2018T13:29:40,SpazztasticKiwi,And yes t rex is not from the Jurassic area. Most of the dinos in the movies aren‚Äôt
11-06-2018T13:29:44,JamesBSquirrel3,I don't think so. We'll have to wait what's Part 2 next year!

11-06-2018T13:46:17,CheeseRS,"fooled you, I was just switching to the PC"
11-06-2018T13:46:23,Matth3w23,Urgh
11-06-2018T13:46:29,Bgrmystr2,&gt;:T getout

11-06-2018T13:46:36,JamesBSquirrel3,What?! Why you litte ...
11-06-2018T13:46:37,BadFoMo,Ban them!
11-06-2018T13:46:43,CheeseRS,Because my phone broke and I have to use my mom's and... yeah she goes to wrok every night
11-06-2018T13:46:47,Matth3w23,Get out before things go from PC to 18
11-06-2018T13:47:10,Bgrmystr2,that probably won't happen matt
11-06-2018T13:47:10,CheeseRS,I don't mind NSFW
11-06-2018T13:47:10,EmmaThePaintDragon,This lighting looks incredible :0
11-06-2018T13:47:12,CheeseRS,( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
11-06-2018T13:47:22,CheeseRS,Yes it totally does
11-06-2018T13:47:26,Bgrmystr2,indeed
11-06-2018T13:47:31,CheeseRS,I type so much faster at the pc
11-06-2018T13:47:34,CheeseRS,whooo
11-06-2018T13:47:36,Matth3w23,More talking about language from being trolled üòõ
11-06-2018T13:47:51,CheeseRS,The downside of this PC is it lags so HARD
11-06-2018T13:48:03,Zakuru,so bright
11-06-2018T13:48:18,CheeseRS,how can I possibly lower the stream resolution to 360p/480p?
11-06-2018T13:48:31,JamesBSquirrel3,"*piff* not my Laptop, y'know!"
11-06-2018T13:48:35,totallynotTrace,"and the lord said ""let there be light"" so there was light. but way too much and everybody got crispy and salty at the lord"
11-06-2018T13:48:42,CheeseRS,hehe
11-06-2018T13:48:51,EmmaThePaintDragon,I don't think you can. Picarto streams at the setting that the streamer has it.
11-06-2018T13:49:10,DrDJMonkeyBoy,"and then the light was turned down a bit, and the lord said ""sorry"""
11-06-2018T13:49:11,CheeseRS,don't worry i am just searching through inspect element
11-06-2018T13:49:11,Matth3w23,"On the left window, it only looks like a single plane of light is coming from the top. To me it doesn't look like there is a 3d ray of light coming from all the window."
11-06-2018T13:49:38,CheeseRS,Well I tried
11-06-2018T13:49:43,CheeseRS,let the lag slowly kill me
11-06-2018T13:49:51,JamesBSquirrel3,"Say, what screen resolution on Picarto.tv have?"
11-06-2018T13:50:04,Matth3w23,Could you change your pc resolution?
11-06-2018T13:50:29,CheeseRS,it's already set to 720p
11-06-2018T13:50:35,CheeseRS,that's not the problem
11-06-2018T13:50:47,DrDJMonkeyBoy,oh geez
11-06-2018T13:50:50,Matth3w23,But would changing it lower lower the stream resolution?
11-06-2018T13:50:54,DrDJMonkeyBoy,that kirby remix wasn't messing around
11-06-2018T13:50:59,CheeseRS,the stream clearly looks like 1080p
11-06-2018T13:51:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,stream crashed ;-;
11-06-2018T13:51:09,Matth3w23,Bad luck marv
11-06-2018T13:51:09,CheeseRS,so messing with the resolution won't help at all
11-06-2018T13:51:13,CheeseRS,F
11-06-2018T13:51:19,Bgrmystr2,rip marv
11-06-2018T13:51:22,JamesBSquirrel3,a Tech say me; MP4
11-06-2018T13:51:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I am...bach
11-06-2018T13:51:29,iliar,@CheeseRS Nope. It's 1080p
11-06-2018T13:51:33,Bgrmystr2,"mp4 is not a resolution, James"
11-06-2018T13:51:36,DrDJMonkeyBoy,okay bach
11-06-2018T13:51:40,CheeseRS,"yeah, the stream is 1080p"
11-06-2018T13:51:42,Bgrmystr2,"not very good tech, mate"
11-06-2018T13:51:45,DrDJMonkeyBoy,im a big fan of your music
11-06-2018T13:51:52,CheeseRS,but my display resolution is 720
11-06-2018T13:51:54,JamesBSquirrel3,What? How come?
11-06-2018T13:52:14,CheeseRS,"if i switch to MP4, the stream crashes"
11-06-2018T13:52:28,Bgrmystr2,Video resolution =|= video codec
11-06-2018T13:52:34,Bgrmystr2,that's how come.
11-06-2018T13:52:34,CheeseRS,exactly
11-06-2018T13:52:38,CheeseRS,my pc is just too slow
11-06-2018T13:52:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Was the music gone for awhile because my signal was jittery or because I mentioned having headphones in
11-06-2018T13:52:47,CheeseRS,"with only a dual core, 2gb of RAM and no GPU"
11-06-2018T13:52:50,Matth3w23,Wouldn't it be your internet speed?
11-06-2018T13:52:58,Matth3w23,Gpu and core wouldn't affect it
11-06-2018T13:53:00,Bgrmystr2,no gpu is probably why cheese
11-06-2018T13:53:02,JamesBSquirrel3,Oh.
11-06-2018T13:53:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,the power of my phone is saving atm
11-06-2018T13:53:07,CheeseRS,"nope, I have 1Gbps internet"
11-06-2018T13:53:12,Matth3w23,Hmm
11-06-2018T13:53:13,CheeseRS,so yeah...
11-06-2018T13:53:23,DrDJMonkeyBoy,bottlenecked by core porlly
11-06-2018T13:53:25,Bgrmystr2,dual core 2gb of ram is enough to run 1080p
11-06-2018T13:53:26,CheeseRS,I could repari my laptop for 20 dollars
11-06-2018T13:53:28,Matth3w23,#blamepicarto
11-06-2018T13:53:30,Bgrmystr2,unlikely DrD
11-06-2018T13:53:38,CheeseRS,blame my trash PC
11-06-2018T13:53:39,DrDJMonkeyBoy,you think it's the GPU?
11-06-2018T13:53:44,Bgrmystr2,the very LACK of gpu yes
11-06-2018T13:53:47,totallynotTrace,depends on the cpu generation and speed
11-06-2018T13:53:49,Matth3w23,Do you have an integrated gpu though?
11-06-2018T13:53:59,CheeseRS,"which isn't mine, it's my brother but my laptop broke so i am using this"
11-06-2018T13:54:02,CheeseRS,yes
11-06-2018T13:54:13,CheeseRS,Intel Q31/Q33
11-06-2018T13:54:19,CheeseRS,lowest tier stuff
11-06-2018T13:54:19,DrDJMonkeyBoy,how much space is open on your comp?
11-06-2018T13:54:20,Bgrmystr2,most intel gpu chipsets on their cpus are trash
11-06-2018T13:54:22,SpazztasticKiwi,:ctwokinds-sleepoverA: this is what his song makes me think of
11-06-2018T13:54:27,SpazztasticKiwi,And it‚Äôs ended
11-06-2018T13:54:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-sleepoverB:
11-06-2018T13:54:49,CheeseRS,@DrDJMonkeyBoy what do you mean?
11-06-2018T13:54:54,JamesBSquirrel3,Teminite - Ascent???
11-06-2018T13:55:01,DrDJMonkeyBoy,is your hard disk almost full?
11-06-2018T13:55:18,CheeseRS,"the capacity of the HDD is 70Gb, what do you think?"
11-06-2018T13:55:24,SpazztasticKiwi,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
11-06-2018T13:55:26,DrDJMonkeyBoy,probably then
11-06-2018T13:55:31,Matth3w23,What about ram?
11-06-2018T13:55:35,DrDJMonkeyBoy,2 GB
11-06-2018T13:55:35,totallynotTrace,oh the q31 chipset came out in 2007
11-06-2018T13:55:44,CheeseRS,ram?
11-06-2018T13:55:46,CheeseRS,uh
11-06-2018T13:55:50,Bgrmystr2,yeah it's gonna be an old cpu meaning the integrated gpu on the cpu won't handle 1080p
11-06-2018T13:55:59,CheeseRS,roughly 60% usage
11-06-2018T13:56:07,CheeseRS,cpu is MAXED
11-06-2018T13:56:12,CheeseRS,100%
11-06-2018T13:56:15,Matth3w23,Try opening task manager and ending certain processes. Just not important ones
11-06-2018T13:56:26,CheeseRS,doing that right now
11-06-2018T13:56:29,JamesBSquirrel3,So we can't get over resolution 1080p?
11-06-2018T13:56:34,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, cuz you have no gpu to push the rendering to"
11-06-2018T13:56:39,Bgrmystr2,so it's all cpu-based
11-06-2018T13:56:41,CheeseRS,svchost.exe byeee
11-06-2018T13:56:49,Bgrmystr2,"that tends to be important, cheese xD"
11-06-2018T13:56:57,CheeseRS,that's the joke
11-06-2018T13:57:06,Bgrmystr2,there's actually one you can safely remove
11-06-2018T13:57:10,Bgrmystr2,but you need to separate it from others
11-06-2018T13:57:15,CheeseRS,closing/stopping sevices can also help
11-06-2018T13:57:29,Bgrmystr2,"it's the one for NSI, it has a massive memory leak in several OS, 7 for sure"
11-06-2018T13:57:41,JamesBSquirrel3,You mean also re-fresh that?
11-06-2018T13:58:06,CheeseRS,i know about that
11-06-2018T13:58:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,streams back \o/
11-06-2018T13:58:16,Matth3w23,Have you tried switching it off and on again üòõ
11-06-2018T13:58:23,CheeseRS,kek
11-06-2018T13:58:25,CheeseRS,yes i did
11-06-2018T13:58:32,Bgrmystr2,"James, the stream is 1080p, and that means that's the resolution you get it. there's no lowering or raising the resolution."
11-06-2018T13:58:37,SpazztasticKiwi,How about smacking it
11-06-2018T13:58:40,Bgrmystr2,not on picarto anyway
11-06-2018T13:58:48,Matth3w23,Biting it?
11-06-2018T13:58:48,Bgrmystr2,you won't be raising the resolution anywhere
11-06-2018T13:58:52,CheeseRS,Picarto please let us change resolution
11-06-2018T13:58:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Or threatening to throw it away
11-06-2018T13:59:02,JamesBSquirrel3,"Oh, that's make sense now!"
11-06-2018T13:59:06,Bgrmystr2,"that'd be beneficial to a lot of people, cheese"
11-06-2018T13:59:11,Bgrmystr2,I agree w/ that
11-06-2018T13:59:15,CheeseRS,@Matth3w23 don't remind me about the bite
11-06-2018T13:59:19,Matth3w23,Have you tried sitting on it cheese?
11-06-2018T13:59:20,SpazztasticKiwi,This song makes me think Pac Man
11-06-2018T13:59:24,CheeseRS,yes i did
11-06-2018T13:59:29,BadFoMo,@CheeseRS I second that.
11-06-2018T13:59:30,CrRAR,:v
11-06-2018T13:59:38,CheeseRS,eh
11-06-2018T13:59:54,JamesBSquirrel3,Ski - Hyper Potions?
11-06-2018T14:00:08,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, james"
11-06-2018T14:00:13,Bgrmystr2,that's the song he's playing
11-06-2018T14:00:14,CheeseRS,the stream will probably be finished before it buffers
11-06-2018T14:00:21,Matth3w23,I think this song is obviously about summer
11-06-2018T14:00:47,CheeseRS,"you know what people? i'll pop the chat out and exit the stream, so we can still talk"
11-06-2018T14:00:50,JamesBSquirrel3,Doesn't sound familiar Wreck-it Ralph?
11-06-2018T14:01:15,Matth3w23,"It's not about a game, it's just music by hyperpotions üòõ"
11-06-2018T14:01:19,CheeseRS,someone with a better pc could stream the stream to youtube so that i can lower the resolution there
11-06-2018T14:01:31,Matth3w23,And now my stream is buffering üòí
11-06-2018T14:01:37,CheeseRS,congrats
11-06-2018T14:02:06,Bgrmystr2,you can just watch the stream later cheese :u
11-06-2018T14:02:09,JamesBSquirrel3,Just like me re-freshing Picarto
11-06-2018T14:02:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake:
11-06-2018T14:02:17,Bgrmystr2,it's recorded
11-06-2018T14:02:17,SpazztasticKiwi,It reminds me of the Owl City song in Wreak it Ralph
11-06-2018T14:02:17,InTheLionsDen,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
11-06-2018T14:02:27,Matth3w23,"Resolution should only depend on internet speed though, you gpu is still handling the same amount of pixels, and not doing any extra processing (I think)"
11-06-2018T14:02:38,Bgrmystr2,"not true, matt"
11-06-2018T14:02:42,Bgrmystr2,not true in any way
11-06-2018T14:02:48,CheeseRS,yeah but i want to also talk to the other viewers
11-06-2018T14:02:58,Matth3w23,Really?
11-06-2018T14:03:06,Matth3w23,But streaming is fetching an image
11-06-2018T14:03:14,Bgrmystr2,watching a 240p stream and a 4k stream is a BIG difference on gpu
11-06-2018T14:03:32,Bgrmystr2,what do you think renders it to put on your screen? :ptv-unimpressed:
11-06-2018T14:03:33,CheeseRS,i can watch a stream in 480p without complaining
11-06-2018T14:03:44,JamesBSquirrel3,I shouldn't do that over my head like anybody else - moving on!
11-06-2018T14:03:49,Mippy,Hmmm....my text is no lobger delayed...thaanks update
11-06-2018T14:04:06,Mippy,I still typo though
11-06-2018T14:04:11,BadFoMo,I would also like it if we could scroll the chat with middle mouse button clicking again and moving the chat to the bottom of the videos in a 2 streamer... thing.
11-06-2018T14:04:24,Bgrmystr2,"streaming does take a lot of internet connection speed, though, yes"
11-06-2018T14:04:29,Bgrmystr2,but that doesn't mean your gpu does nothing
11-06-2018T14:04:32,BadFoMo,P.S. Late coment is late.
11-06-2018T14:04:41,BadFoMo,*comment?

11-06-2018T14:08:07,FuryFaZeFurry,Short trumpet
11-06-2018T14:08:08,CheeseRS,oooooohhhh the lag
11-06-2018T14:08:09,Bgrmystr2,trumpet is more similar to the tuba than a sax is
11-06-2018T14:08:32,Matth3w23,"Just researched it, and the internet says yes and no. Thanks internet."
11-06-2018T14:08:42,CheeseRS,good guy internet
11-06-2018T14:09:04,Mippy,Ask internet one question get 20 different answers
11-06-2018T14:09:08,JamesBSquirrel3,My buffering trouble again! RE-FRESH IT
11-06-2018T14:09:39,Bgrmystr2,"refreshing won't solve hardware issues, james. which seems likely"
11-06-2018T14:09:42,CheeseRS,Rose is beautiful right now...
11-06-2018T14:10:05,JamesBSquirrel3,"I know, its pain, anyway"
11-06-2018T14:10:45,Matth3w23,"Buffering is down to internet speed (I. E. Not having the next picture ready), lagging is down to hardware."
11-06-2018T14:10:46,CheeseRS,"Hey Tom, care to tell what the resolution of each comic page is?"
11-06-2018T14:11:06,CheeseRS,well I lag and buffer at the same time
11-06-2018T14:11:11,Bgrmystr2,"he does them really high resolution in photoshop, probably 4k or so"
11-06-2018T14:11:12,CheeseRS,hmm
11-06-2018T14:11:18,Matth3w23,That's technology for you
11-06-2018T14:11:24,Bgrmystr2,but then outputs them on the site at the resolution you see them at
11-06-2018T14:12:51,JamesBSquirrel3,"hhmmm clear picture outputs, huh ..."
11-06-2018T14:13:07,CheeseRS,"Well then, the final panels, huh?"
11-06-2018T14:13:25,Bgrmystr2,he still needs to do the background for the rest of the panels
11-06-2018T14:13:30,CheeseRS,OH
11-06-2018T14:13:34,CheeseRS,I got it just now
11-06-2018T14:13:37,Bgrmystr2,I don't think he's going to leave them all brown
11-06-2018T14:13:44,CheeseRS,Trace is going to show Rose his hand
11-06-2018T14:14:14,CheeseRS,"Also, tell her about his relationship between him and Flora"
11-06-2018T14:14:36,Matth3w23,"Dunno, I think it's more about him being concerned about flora."
11-06-2018T14:14:46,CheeseRS,"Also, the last floor"
11-06-2018T14:14:48,CheeseRS,53.0.2907.68
11-06-2018T14:14:49,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno bout the hand, but I think it'll probably be about flora"
11-06-2018T14:14:49,JamesBSquirrel3,Now I believe you guys familiar Chapter 12 of What happen is Trace's hand?
11-06-2018T14:14:52,CheeseRS,oops
11-06-2018T14:15:04,iliar,@Bgrmystr2 Tom draws in a resolution of 600 dpi. Publish in the resolution of 100 dpi. So you can get publick resolution 825 x 1075 and multiply at 6.
11-06-2018T14:15:15,Matth3w23,Ip address or something cheese?
11-06-2018T14:15:31,CheeseRS,"uh, version of my opera browser"
11-06-2018T14:15:41,CheeseRS,i sent some feedback to Picarto
11-06-2018T14:15:45,Bgrmystr2,"5kx6k, iliar"
11-06-2018T14:15:53,Bgrmystr2,"that's about ""Or so"" from 4k xD"
11-06-2018T14:15:56,BadFoMo,Opera browser?
11-06-2018T14:15:56,iliar,4950 x 6450
11-06-2018T14:16:00,Bgrmystr2,it's not 8k
11-06-2018T14:16:03,CheeseRS,"so, 6K"
11-06-2018T14:16:08,CheeseRS,that's big
11-06-2018T14:16:26,Matth3w23,Bigger is always better üòú
11-06-2018T14:16:31,CheeseRS,yes
11-06-2018T14:16:40,Bgrmystr2,for the proper image file yes
11-06-2018T14:16:45,Bgrmystr2,not for stuff like Jpegs
11-06-2018T14:16:47,CheeseRS,"well, most of the time"
11-06-2018T14:16:56,JamesBSquirrel3,Wait you mean btw 4 or 6K?
11-06-2018T14:17:12,CheeseRS,who are you asking James?
11-06-2018T14:17:13,Bgrmystr2,"pngs are better, but you want vectors for big images"
11-06-2018T14:17:25,CheeseRS,true
11-06-2018T14:17:48,JamesBSquirrel3,Bgrmystr2 please tell me was 4 or 6K?
11-06-2018T14:18:02,Bgrmystr2,tom and sage draw w/ vector lines when making their comics
11-06-2018T14:18:14,Bgrmystr2,"it was already stated it was 6k, james"
11-06-2018T14:18:21,Bgrmystr2,follow the chat bro :u
11-06-2018T14:18:27,CheeseRS,:V
11-06-2018T14:18:36,BadFoMo,They do?
11-06-2018T14:18:38,Mippy,*pretends she  understans the convesation*
11-06-2018T14:18:52,JamesBSquirrel3,OMG
11-06-2018T14:19:03,Twokinds,I do not draw in vector
11-06-2018T14:19:09,Bgrmystr2,you don't?
11-06-2018T14:19:12,SpotTheLeopard,"PS is raster-based, not vector"
11-06-2018T14:19:14,BadFoMo,I knew it!
11-06-2018T14:19:15,Matth3w23,Vector basically means you can zoom in as far as you want without loosing quality
11-06-2018T14:19:16,Bgrmystr2,it's not vector lines?
11-06-2018T14:19:17,Twokinds,"I use photoshop, which doesn't have vector inking. It's all raster."
11-06-2018T14:19:17,Bgrmystr2,huh
11-06-2018T14:19:18,totallynotTrace,thanks to my addiction to linus tech tips I understand some of this
11-06-2018T14:19:23,Bgrmystr2,ooh hm
11-06-2018T14:19:28,Bgrmystr2,is it the same thing? :o
11-06-2018T14:19:35,Mippy,No Vector Confermed
11-06-2018T14:19:37,CheeseRS,"anyway, can anyone tell me what kind of tool is used to delay the drawing of lines with a slight delay, so you have more control over the curves?"
11-06-2018T14:19:39,JamesBSquirrel3,"Raster, eh?"
11-06-2018T14:20:03,CheeseRS,"wait, i wrote delay 2 times"
11-06-2018T14:20:10,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, I learned somethin new"
11-06-2018T14:20:16,Bgrmystr2,I did not know PS didn't use vector
11-06-2018T14:20:17,CheeseRS,congrats
11-06-2018T14:20:45,SpotTheLeopard,vector is mathematically scaled; raster is pixel-based
11-06-2018T14:20:54,Bgrmystr2,ah okay
11-06-2018T14:20:56,CheeseRS,"so my brother came home almost 20 minutes ago, he is bored so I should let him play..."
11-06-2018T14:21:00,SpotTheLeopard,Adobe Illustrator would be vector based
11-06-2018T14:21:06,Bgrmystr2,rip photoshop for not using vector then
11-06-2018T14:21:07,iliar,"@Twokinds As I noticed, you even draw bubbles in the raster. It looks strange to me."
11-06-2018T14:21:14,JamesBSquirrel3,I couldn't learn more of Adobe Photoshop points!
11-06-2018T14:21:16,CheeseRS,"It was nice seeing you all, I'll catch up with you on the next stream, alright?"
11-06-2018T14:21:22,CheeseRS,Good night!
11-06-2018T14:21:22,Bgrmystr2,mkay cheese
11-06-2018T14:21:24,Matth3w23,Bye cheese!
11-06-2018T14:21:25,BadFoMo,Bye.
11-06-2018T14:21:44,JamesBSquirrel3,"Once again then, bye Cheese"
11-06-2018T14:22:16,iliar,"In my opinion, bubbles are much easier to draw in a vector."
11-06-2018T14:22:37,SpotTheLeopard,"So vector is good for something like a logo, where you may want to enlarge the image without getting a grainy look on edges"
11-06-2018T14:22:52,Bgrmystr2,vector is good for everything from what it seems like
11-06-2018T14:23:07,Matth3w23,Some people use many different resolutions for the same logo
11-06-2018T14:23:36,Matth3w23,Does bitmap save more space?
11-06-2018T14:24:09,SpotTheLeopard,"raster tends to be better for color blending, hence the photo part of photoshop"
11-06-2018T14:24:14,JamesBSquirrel3,So Rose fears could be a truth can be seen as Trace shown dark hand?
11-06-2018T14:24:18,Bgrmystr2,"not really, bitmap is inefficient in a pure form, matt"
11-06-2018T14:24:22,CheeseRS,Sorry for trolling you two time in one day...
11-06-2018T14:24:24,Bgrmystr2,cuz it's a raw image
11-06-2018T14:24:31,Matth3w23,CHEESE!
11-06-2018T14:24:33,CheeseRS,My brother»õs legs hurt so he»õs staying in bed
11-06-2018T14:24:45,CheeseRS,anyway
11-06-2018T14:24:53,Bgrmystr2,"nope cheese, you're not here anymore for me."
11-06-2018T14:24:56,Bgrmystr2,you left twice.
11-06-2018T14:24:57,CheeseRS,didi miss anything?
11-06-2018T14:25:01,Bgrmystr2,lost all your souls.
11-06-2018T14:25:02,CheeseRS,k cool thx
11-06-2018T14:25:17,Bgrmystr2,:thumbsup:
11-06-2018T14:25:21,JamesBSquirrel3,pls Are you still here Cheese?!?
11-06-2018T14:25:34,Matth3w23,You missed tom showing the plot for the next year of the comic
11-06-2018T14:25:35,CheeseRS,yes
11-06-2018T14:25:40,Matth3w23,Pretty big thing
11-06-2018T14:25:41,CheeseRS,and i will stay until the end now
11-06-2018T14:25:50,CheeseRS,good joke Matt
11-06-2018T14:25:56,iliar,@Bgrmystr2 The vector is good for simple geometric shapes. Such as bubbles. For objects with a complex texture ... I think you do not want to draw a photorealistic tree bark in a vector.
11-06-2018T14:26:31,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: I've seen some damn good scenery in vectors, so I dunno."
11-06-2018T14:26:33,BadFoMo,Sgt. Dornun: This is the second time you have trolled today! There Will Not Be A Third!
11-06-2018T14:26:37,CheeseRS,i will be the first man to draw a photorealistic tree bark in vectors
11-06-2018T14:26:48,Bgrmystr2,prolly not cheese xD
11-06-2018T14:27:03,CheeseRS,absolutely not
11-06-2018T14:27:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Rose is green eyed. Cause her glare is like thorns
11-06-2018T14:27:46,CheeseRS,Smooth Kiwi
11-06-2018T14:28:05,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs what I imagine Tom was shooting for
11-06-2018T14:28:15,CheeseRS,well then... Smooth Tom
11-06-2018T14:28:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Or he just picked a color
11-06-2018T14:28:22,Bgrmystr2,"prolly the latter, kiwi"
11-06-2018T14:28:23,BadFoMo,...A might be [Databace error]'s Mom.
11-06-2018T14:28:26,CheeseRS,back again to Smooth Kiwi
11-06-2018T14:28:29,SpotTheLeopard,"back to the original point, the image is drawn larger in raster to a) help hide drawing errors, b) be large enough for print resolution. Raster can scale down fine, but looks bad scaled up."
11-06-2018T14:28:39,Matth3w23,Green also may show intelligence
11-06-2018T14:28:50,Bgrmystr2,yeh spot
11-06-2018T14:28:58,CheeseRS,"oh, complimenting intelligence are we now?"
11-06-2018T14:29:12,Matth3w23,"Dunno, just stereotypes of colour"
11-06-2018T14:29:20,JamesBSquirrel3,"We couldn't find more characters are, like someone say Database Error's Mum."
11-06-2018T14:29:23,Bgrmystr2,"I like vectors more really, cuz there is no problem with zooming in or out, or adjusting resolution"
11-06-2018T14:29:48,Bgrmystr2,and you can make the vector big enough where it'd be the same as a raster
11-06-2018T14:30:06,BadFoMo,@SpotTheLeopard I think that might be the only thing I took away from my Photoshop classes.
11-06-2018T14:30:07,CheeseRS,until you encounter a higly complex vector thingy
11-06-2018T14:30:07,Bgrmystr2,w/ the color changes
11-06-2018T14:30:11,JamesBSquirrel3,What a rest background gonna be?
11-06-2018T14:30:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Green eyes means intelligence you say? Aw shucks
11-06-2018T14:30:26,Matth3w23,üòõ
11-06-2018T14:30:44,Bgrmystr2,"lol cheese ""Highly complex"" Just make the vector bigger then."
11-06-2018T14:30:57,Bgrmystr2,"bigger vector, smaller color transitions"
11-06-2018T14:31:09,CheeseRS,also blue eyes mean you're a... --shouldn't say this but hey i'm trying to have fun here-- nazi
11-06-2018T14:31:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I guess she never gets pinched on St Patrick‚Äôs
11-06-2018T14:31:22,Bgrmystr2,cheese no :u
11-06-2018T14:31:27,SpazztasticKiwi,My sister‚Äôs blue eyed
11-06-2018T14:31:28,Bgrmystr2,you need blond hair too
11-06-2018T14:31:35,CheeseRS,oh yeah
11-06-2018T14:31:37,Bgrmystr2,and a bunch of other things
11-06-2018T14:31:47,CheeseRS,someone paint Trace's hair blonde so he can be a nazi
11-06-2018T14:31:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"Dark blue, almost hazel, but still"
11-06-2018T14:31:49,BadFoMo,And a square jaw.
11-06-2018T14:32:09,CheeseRS,and add him a square moustache
11-06-2018T14:32:20,Matth3w23,"That doesn't make them a nazi, just what they viewed as the perfect race üòõ"
11-06-2018T14:32:37,CheeseRS,the arian race was shit anyway
11-06-2018T14:32:46,CheeseRS,the could never stand a chance to normal people
11-06-2018T14:32:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Y‚Äôall losing brownie points fast
11-06-2018T14:32:55,SpotTheLeopard,"anywho, I stick mostly to photoshop because I prefer drawing that way. Haven't done much in Illustrator outside of a few graphic design pieces 'cause the pen tool just isn't as natural to me for use"
11-06-2018T14:32:56,JamesBSquirrel3,Trace's hair shiny!:ptv-excited:
11-06-2018T14:33:00,CheeseRS,i never ate brownies
11-06-2018T14:33:03,Bgrmystr2,"I had hazel eyes when I was a kid, kiwi"
11-06-2018T14:33:11,Bgrmystr2,"wtf are you doing with your life, cheese"
11-06-2018T14:33:14,Bgrmystr2,really
11-06-2018T14:33:17,CheeseRS,yes
11-06-2018T14:33:18,Bgrmystr2,go eat a brownie
11-06-2018T14:33:21,Bgrmystr2,right now
11-06-2018T14:33:24,Bgrmystr2,just stop everything
11-06-2018T14:33:29,totallynotTrace,lastly replace the emblem on his cloak with a swaztica and poof then hes definately nazi
11-06-2018T14:33:30,Bgrmystr2,jesus man
11-06-2018T14:33:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Mine went from blue to hazel and finally faded out to green
11-06-2018T14:33:32,CheeseRS,"first off, my country doesn't know what a brownie is"
11-06-2018T14:33:41,Bgrmystr2,xDD
11-06-2018T14:33:43,BadFoMo,"Na, Blonde hair would only make Trace look like he's trying to cosplay as Sonichue."
11-06-2018T14:33:46,CheeseRS,seriously
11-06-2018T14:33:54,Bgrmystr2,cheese's country is a rock confirmed
11-06-2018T14:34:02,InTheLionsDen,Introduce them. Make a fortune.
11-06-2018T14:34:11,CheeseRS,"nah, it's just Romania"
11-06-2018T14:34:15,JamesBSquirrel3,Is that a Last Ray of Light? Music?
11-06-2018T14:34:19,CheeseRS,we do have many alcoholic drinks though
11-06-2018T14:34:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Trace with shimmer hair
11-06-2018T14:34:25,SpotTheLeopard,blue eyes could also mean you're a white dragon
11-06-2018T14:34:31,CheeseRS,hehe
11-06-2018T14:34:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"Someone spill glitter on him, quick"
11-06-2018T14:34:44,BadFoMo,@JamesBSquirrel3 I think so?
11-06-2018T14:35:04,Matth3w23,Been ages since I've read Yu-Gi-Oh...
11-06-2018T14:35:08,CheeseRS,"had to check, but nora's eyes are yellow"
11-06-2018T14:35:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Cats like reflective things...
11-06-2018T14:35:12,CheeseRS,kinda like Flora's
11-06-2018T14:35:21,JamesBSquirrel3,@BadFoMo I guess it is.
11-06-2018T14:35:26,Matth3w23,Keith is best eyes
11-06-2018T14:35:37,BadFoMo,Flora becomes Nora confurmed.
11-06-2018T14:35:46,CheeseRS,Yay!
11-06-2018T14:36:00,JamesBSquirrel3,Surf!
11-06-2018T14:36:05,CheeseRS,I choose the orange color because it kinda looks like cheese
11-06-2018T14:36:13,CheeseRS,"But, it looks more like Flora's fur"
11-06-2018T14:36:33,CheeseRS,Waitaminute...
11-06-2018T14:36:40,CheeseRS,"Tom, you forgot about the background"
11-06-2018T14:36:47,JamesBSquirrel3,Let's Dance Surf!
11-06-2018T14:36:49,Matth3w23,Hang in cheese!
11-06-2018T14:36:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Give him a minute
11-06-2018T14:36:58,Matth3w23,That comes later üòõ
11-06-2018T14:36:59,BadFoMo,It's in his que.
11-06-2018T14:37:07,SpazztasticKiwi,He only draws with the one hand
11-06-2018T14:37:11,Matth3w23,"And James, I prefer time trials üòú"
11-06-2018T14:37:13,CheeseRS,"60 seconds, 59 seconds, 58 seconds..."
11-06-2018T14:37:33,JamesBSquirrel3,ME???
11-06-2018T14:37:56,Matth3w23,Yes I was speaking to you üòõ
11-06-2018T14:38:02,CheeseRS,you
11-06-2018T14:38:17,JamesBSquirrel3,I done that part!
11-06-2018T14:38:22,CheeseRS,good
11-06-2018T14:39:26,JamesBSquirrel3,The Last Part is Rose geogous hair!
11-06-2018T14:39:52,CheeseRS,I think Rose is the best elderly character in this comic

11-06-2018T17:27:15,Bgrmystr2,lawn stuff
11-06-2018T17:27:34,Bgrmystr2,"""yard work"" just looked"
11-06-2018T17:27:44,Bgrmystr2,so mebbe not lawn specifically
11-06-2018T17:27:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Ah the constantly regrowing green stuff
11-06-2018T17:28:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"Hedges, grass, weeds..."
11-06-2018T17:29:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Our blackberry and blueberry bushes are starting to ripen about now
11-06-2018T17:29:12,MviluUatusun,"I wish I could cut my grass.  For the last two weeks, its rained almost every day."
11-06-2018T17:29:59,MviluUatusun,"Today, it rained harder than it has since the tropical storm/hurricane passed through last year."
11-06-2018T17:30:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"We‚Äôre supposed to be getting rain, but all it‚Äôs been doing is be dark and gloomy with wind and cooler weather"
11-06-2018T17:31:50,MviluUatusun,At least I was able to buy some gasoline for my lawnmower.  Now all I have to do is have some dry days so I can get out and mow our jungle.
11-06-2018T17:33:50,SpazztasticKiwi,We prefer recharging weed eaters
11-06-2018T17:34:16,SpazztasticKiwi,We‚Äôre on a hill so there‚Äôs no flatness for a mower
11-06-2018T17:36:21,SpazztasticKiwi,My grandma has a really nice large yard but she‚Äôs hired someone to cut it
11-06-2018T17:36:58,MviluUatusun,"Well, if you lived on a coastal plain, like I do, you'd have plenty of flat land to use a mower.  LOL."
11-06-2018T17:37:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt live anywhere near the coast
11-06-2018T17:37:45,MarshallMelon,"Guys, it's 2018. You should modernize and duct tape a machete to a roomba. Bam, AI gardening!"
11-06-2018T17:38:03,MviluUatusun,The highest hill on our land is all of 1 foot(?) above the rest of the ground.  LOL.
11-06-2018T17:38:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Be nice to be able to sit on a beach and watch the ocean
11-06-2018T17:38:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Sunbathe
11-06-2018T17:38:48,MviluUatusun,"Well, I live about 15 miles from the ocean.  But, I do have a salt water river about 200 yards from my house."
11-06-2018T17:38:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I know my grandpa lives near the coast
11-06-2018T17:39:02,SpazztasticKiwi,But in Cali
11-06-2018T17:39:32,MviluUatusun,I lived in California for about a year and a half back in the early 80s.
11-06-2018T17:40:14,MviluUatusun,"I had always thought that Mark Twain was making a joke when he said, ""The coldest winter I ever experienced was a summer in San Francisco."""
11-06-2018T17:40:21,MviluUatusun,He wasn't even close to joking.
11-06-2018T17:40:49,SpazztasticKiwi,San Fran is where he lives
11-06-2018T17:41:08,MviluUatusun,That was the only summer I ever lived through where I needed a jacket in August.
11-06-2018T17:41:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"He‚Äôs said if he could, he‚Äôd move, but his business is established there and it‚Äôs too late to move. Not worth it to uproot now"
11-06-2018T17:41:43,MviluUatusun,"Actually, I was in Sunnyvale."
11-06-2018T17:42:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"And that if he had the chance, he‚Äôd have settled somewhere else"
11-06-2018T17:42:11,MviluUatusun,I lived in Mountain View when I first arrived and moved to Santa Clara.
11-06-2018T17:43:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I think he wants to move to get away from his younger son and the messiness that Cali‚Äôs become for him
11-06-2018T17:57:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom üê¶ the comic
11-06-2018T17:57:44,SpazztasticKiwi,The lighting has little glittery fairy bits in it

11-06-2018T18:39:54,MviluUatusun,"Well, since I missed the stream, I'm going to head on out of here.  I'll see y'all next time I'm here."
11-06-2018T18:45:35,SpazztasticKiwi,My sister just went to feed her bearded dragons and Phoenix is laying eggs
11-06-2018T19:01:40,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
11-06-2018T19:03:04,SpazztasticKiwi,They‚Äôre not fertile so no babies but it means she‚Äôs officially at least a year old

11-06-2018T19:50:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I do wonder what she‚Äôs going to do if she does decide to breed them
11-06-2018T19:50:53,Twokinds,Well you know what they say
11-06-2018T19:51:05,Twokinds,"Life, uh, finds a way."
11-06-2018T19:52:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"They‚Äôre in separate cages. If we get fertile eggs, I‚Äôm naming it the Superman clutch"

11-06-2018T19:54:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Then I remembered the lady and dog thing from earlier
11-06-2018T19:54:52,CrRAR,lol
11-06-2018T19:55:17,Twokinds,:egg: &lt;- dog egg
11-06-2018T19:56:32,SpazztasticKiwi,It might be easier for dogs if they laid eggs
11-06-2018T19:57:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve helped in dog births before. Fun stuff

11-06-2018T20:13:59,Twokinds,Uh... I'm not sure what your suggestion was.
11-06-2018T20:14:00,BluePhantom90,I take Tom Your brother was a trouble maker of the family
11-06-2018T20:14:42,Twokinds,Uh... not really...

11-06-2018T20:21:44,BluePhantom90,Also I jumped on a Big bed in a museum.
11-06-2018T20:22:31,SpazztasticKiwi,It was the Eric boops Kat thing. I was thinking it may not be very interesting

11-06-2018T20:26:06,Bgrmystr2,"and if we didn't have drunk kat, we probably wouldn't have drunk kat butt either"

11-06-2018T20:30:02,SpazztasticKiwi,But I imagine Kat would be the friendly type
11-06-2018T20:30:59,unsteddyphoenix,Surprised Kat didnt go for pink cocktails
11-06-2018T20:33:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I could see her with a lemon drop

11-06-2018T20:36:12,SpazztasticKiwi,If she‚Äôs out drinking I‚Äôd imagine that‚Äôs her attitude. Unless she was just trying to build liquid courage
11-06-2018T20:36:13,CrRAR,"Eric: ""Here go have an awesome time"" *dashes in the opposite direction*"

11-06-2018T21:07:51,CrRAR,He's probably heard just about everything cashiering at PetSmart.
11-06-2018T21:08:46,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs what I was thinking when he thought he heard a young woman with a kitty in the cart supposedly say ‚Äúkittenballs‚Äù
11-06-2018T21:12:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Neither of my emails are that lewd
11-06-2018T21:12:53,unsteddyphoenix,"I wouldnt take ""kittenballs"" as lewd"

11-06-2018T21:21:02,unsteddyphoenix,Cats that sleep under blankets are always weird
11-06-2018T21:22:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Can‚Äôt leave the bed either. He‚Äôll roll over onto my spot
11-06-2018T21:23:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I once woke up to something hairy on my back. He‚Äôd gotten himself under the covers without me realizing
11-06-2018T21:23:40,CrRAR,they are good at snooping about.
11-06-2018T21:24:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Nearly freaked out
11-06-2018T21:24:52,unsteddyphoenix,so cute

11-06-2018T21:27:20,Twokinds,Sam doesn't seem to mind.
11-06-2018T21:27:41,CrRAR,haha
11-06-2018T21:28:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Sam had a full body pillow and intentionally fell asleep on him
11-06-2018T21:29:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"That, I‚Äôd be thrilled with. Not randomly waking up to a hairy back"
11-06-2018T21:29:51,unsteddyphoenix,Rather wake up to a hairy stomach?
11-06-2018T21:29:55,unsteddyphoenix,I get that
11-06-2018T21:30:23,SpazztasticKiwi,If the hair‚Äôs on the other person
11-06-2018T21:30:26,CrRAR,"unsteddy, you're a dude, it's okay"
11-06-2018T21:30:31,CrRAR,xD
11-06-2018T21:30:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe not the stomach
11-06-2018T21:30:57,unsteddyphoenix,:(
11-06-2018T21:31:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Though fuzz happens
11-06-2018T21:31:08,unsteddyphoenix,rip me
11-06-2018T21:31:28,unsteddyphoenix,Its romantic until you realise sam probably drooled all over Colin
11-06-2018T21:32:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve heard girls talk about the ol ‚Äúgoodie trail‚Äù
11-06-2018T21:33:55,unsteddyphoenix,only good things right
11-06-2018T21:34:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Depends on the guy
11-06-2018T21:35:20,CrRAR,I'm just impressed Sam managed to balance where she's at and not get lost forever in the couch seam.
11-06-2018T21:35:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Colin is like a couch cover
11-06-2018T21:35:51,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe Colin spent the whole time balancing her
11-06-2018T21:36:01,unsteddyphoenix,"When she started slipping he just, nudged her back."
11-06-2018T21:36:36,CrRAR,"haha, that's not confusion it's CONCENTRATION!"
11-06-2018T21:36:43,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI really need to roll over‚Äù
11-06-2018T21:37:58,unsteddyphoenix,"Ive been there Colin, and you  must accept there's  no moving for you anymore."
11-06-2018T21:38:23,CrRAR,You could have Colin do the same reaction and just have Sam's arm emerging from the seam He'd look just as confused about where she'd gone.
11-06-2018T21:38:45,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúWow. Never realized there are 462 tiles on the ceiling‚Äù
11-06-2018T21:38:52,CrRAR,lol

11-06-2018T21:45:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚ÄúHour 3 - my right arm has lost all feeling, and my left is going tingly.‚Äù"
11-06-2018T21:48:35,unsteddyphoenix,"""Hour 6 - she's never waking up. This is where I die. Honestly, there are worse ways to go."""
11-06-2018T21:49:48,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúHour 7 - she almost rolled off on to the floor. Mini heart attack awoke my arms‚Äù
11-06-2018T21:51:06,BadFoMo,"""Hour 8 - Sam suspects nothing."""
11-06-2018T21:51:10,unsteddyphoenix,"""Hour 8 - it's been 3 days I think. Worried that my rumbling stomach will wake her up."""
11-06-2018T21:52:03,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúHour 9 - I‚Äôm seriously considering shaving all my hair if this is what happens‚Äù
11-06-2018T21:52:42,unsteddyphoenix,hahaha
11-06-2018T21:54:45,Dadrobit,Never heard it called a goodie trail.

11-06-2018T21:57:15,SpazztasticKiwi,More unpleasant
11-06-2018T21:57:42,Dadrobit,"Snail trails are exclusively for women, and it doesn't involve hair."

11-06-2018T22:08:57,SpazztasticKiwi,It definitely could be
11-06-2018T22:09:18,Dadrobit,Nah. I'm going out with my dad to see 2001 A Space Odyssey and getting him a decent projector to replace his old one.
11-06-2018T22:09:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I was thinking just flowers or something

11-06-2018T22:49:53,Bgrmystr2,I would suggest giving it a cat-sized infinihat.. but I don't know if I trust a cat with an infinihat
11-06-2018T23:16:33,SpazztasticKiwi,World domination
