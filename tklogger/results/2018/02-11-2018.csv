02-11-2018T00:39:30,Bgrmystr2,I guess the sketch and lineart kinda blends to me
02-11-2018T00:39:46,Bgrmystr2,"it's all black & white scribbles, then things get all colorful"
02-11-2018T00:39:48,SageSaga,yep - soon as i finish the sketch i will ink it and color it on the Sat stream

02-11-2018T00:43:02,Rosscoe,I just recalled its no shave november
02-11-2018T00:43:25,SageSaga,ive shaved more this November than i did last month
02-11-2018T00:43:39,Bgrmystr2,yeah I don't bother with any of the no X months
02-11-2018T00:43:40,GhostPack24,That is what i call a short line of a script
02-11-2018T00:43:48,Rosscoe,im just shaving around my mouth and chin.
02-11-2018T00:43:54,Rosscoe,Doing the british chops this year
02-11-2018T00:44:18,GhostPack24,Ok?
02-11-2018T00:44:41,Bgrmystr2,definitely not okay *vibrating flora*
02-11-2018T00:44:53,Bgrmystr2,even tho I can't post it :U
02-11-2018T00:44:57,Rosscoe,I suusally grow a beard every winter anyways so this no shave is just some fad
02-11-2018T00:45:10,Ordithus,"Gonna hit the sack.  Goodnight, and thanks for the stream, Sage!"
02-11-2018T00:45:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Ord

02-11-2018T00:45:28,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-natanisleep:
02-11-2018T00:45:28,Bgrmystr2,"ay ord, thanks."
02-11-2018T00:45:31,Bgrmystr2,what ord said.
02-11-2018T00:45:35,Bgrmystr2,"Also, gnight man"
02-11-2018T00:45:54,SageSaga,man ive had a hair splinter in my finger for 2 weeks now
02-11-2018T00:46:01,GhostPack24,Bye ord
02-11-2018T00:46:23,GhostPack24,Oof
02-11-2018T00:47:02,Bgrmystr2,"you should probably remove it, sage"
02-11-2018T00:47:27,SageSaga,i cant
02-11-2018T00:47:30,SageSaga,its too small
02-11-2018T00:47:56,GhostPack24,OOF!
02-11-2018T00:48:10,SageSaga,i would have to cut open my finger to get to it
02-11-2018T00:48:28,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: it may get infected if you leave it in
02-11-2018T00:48:35,GhostPack24,OOF!
02-11-2018T00:48:37,Rosscoe,it'll work its way out
02-11-2018T00:48:42,Rosscoe,or you body will eat it
02-11-2018T00:48:44,SageSaga,its been there for 2 weeks - it would have been infected by now
02-11-2018T00:49:02,Bgrmystr2,it's probably too close to the surface then
02-11-2018T00:49:06,SageSaga,besides if it did - it would swell and pop out
02-11-2018T00:49:09,Mihari,My fingers hurt T_T
02-11-2018T00:49:20,Mihari,I hate you Kulve Taroth!
02-11-2018T00:49:24,Mihari,shakes fist.
02-11-2018T00:49:29,SageSaga,you should do it in multiplayer hun
02-11-2018T00:49:40,SageSaga,2 runs level 17 rewards
02-11-2018T00:49:42,Bgrmystr2,you can prolly cut a layer or two close to the end it went in and just nab it lol
02-11-2018T00:49:56,GhostPack24,I forgot what i was going to say
02-11-2018T00:49:59,SageSaga,i'll let the skin shed and get it then
02-11-2018T00:50:01,Mihari,I got level 17 rewards on the last one I did solo.
02-11-2018T00:50:10,SageSaga,yeah but how long did it take?
02-11-2018T00:50:21,Mihari,"Broke the tail and the chest before the horns, true dps check!"
02-11-2018T00:50:25,Bgrmystr2,"Hope it works out okay, sage"
02-11-2018T00:50:34,w0lfmare,"Off for tonight, night everyone!"
02-11-2018T00:50:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night w0lfy
02-11-2018T00:50:43,Bgrmystr2,Gnight then w0lf
02-11-2018T00:50:43,Mihari,Over and hour I didn't really keep track.
02-11-2018T00:50:44,BadFoMo,Good night.
02-11-2018T00:50:46,w0lfmare,Thanks for the stream Sage :thumbsup:
02-11-2018T00:50:57,SageSaga,take care W0lf
02-11-2018T00:51:01,Mihari,The first two run aways were 24 minutes
02-11-2018T00:51:05,Rosscoe,Bye Wolf!
02-11-2018T00:51:07,GhostPack24,DEAD I AM NOW
02-11-2018T00:51:09,SageSaga,how many runs did you do?
02-11-2018T00:51:17,Rosscoe,"I need to upgrade my mosnter hunter gear, / farm matts"
02-11-2018T00:51:25,Mihari,Ummm.... 4 I think.
02-11-2018T00:51:26,SageSaga,what Pursuit level are ya killing it at?
02-11-2018T00:51:29,Mihari,4
02-11-2018T00:52:14,SageSaga,online with a decent group you do 1 at pursuit 1- and by the time the groups have all done that it's pursuit 5 or 6 so then everyone does those- even if they fail they get good rewards
02-11-2018T00:52:36,SageSaga,and its a lot more chill
02-11-2018T00:52:54,GhostPack24,OvO
02-11-2018T00:53:01,Mihari,"I can do it solo so I shall, it's also a great source of pride XD"
02-11-2018T00:53:30,SageSaga,i wanna do it again with you to see what kinda monster you have become XD
02-11-2018T00:53:41,GhostPack24,I am so a bord
02-11-2018T00:53:56,Rosscoe,A fisty cheata mayhaps? Covered in death o.o
02-11-2018T00:53:56,SageSaga,i finally found the dodge points on the roll btw
02-11-2018T00:54:00,GhostPack24,I mean i am bord
02-11-2018T00:54:04,Mihari,Well I think it would be different with two people after walk arounds since it swaps focus.
02-11-2018T00:54:40,Mihari,It's easier to predict if it's only coming after you.
02-11-2018T00:54:55,SageSaga,yeah a bit but it should be easier with multiple people
02-11-2018T00:55:17,Mihari,"I'd like to do it with 4 people I know, but no more than that."
02-11-2018T00:55:23,Mihari,err 3 eople
02-11-2018T00:55:34,Mihari,Never had that full group experience.
02-11-2018T00:55:38,SageSaga,well we need 2 people
02-11-2018T00:55:43,GhostPack24,Someone intertain me plz
02-11-2018T00:55:49,Mihari,No.
02-11-2018T00:56:04,Mihari,The stream should be your source of entertainment.
02-11-2018T00:56:14,SageSaga,Avencri and Scorp?
02-11-2018T00:56:20,Mihari,Scorp would lag out
02-11-2018T00:56:20,GhostPack24,😢
02-11-2018T00:56:35,Mihari,"Aven, maybe...."
02-11-2018T00:56:39,SageSaga,i wonder when Mike gets back from Japan
02-11-2018T00:56:41,BigSonicFan,"*tap dances for you, GhostPack24* :3"

02-11-2018T00:59:39,SageSaga,guys- i just checked Ghost's IP vs BigSonicFan- they are the same person talking to themselves
02-11-2018T00:59:50,Rosscoe,Sadly im too far behind in the game to help you Mihari :(
02-11-2018T00:59:51,SageSaga,im kidding- i cant check IPs...
02-11-2018T01:00:18,ZRO4825,"I wanna play MHW with you guys, but I need to upgrade my PC. It tries to kill this CPU, lol."
02-11-2018T01:00:47,Rosscoe,not on AMD are you ZRO?
02-11-2018T01:01:05,ZRO4825,"Nah, old i5 3570k."
02-11-2018T01:01:12,BigSonicFan,"@SageSags, Wow! XD"
02-11-2018T01:01:13,ZRO4825,"Built this computer likes 6+ years ago, lol"

02-11-2018T01:01:19,Orionfire,i loved my i5-3300
02-11-2018T01:01:21,Orionfire,solid thing

02-11-2018T01:01:27,BadFoMo,@SageSaga GhostPack24 and BigSonicFan are you!
02-11-2018T01:01:44,ZRO4825,"Oh this computer is solid, it's just...MHW just tears into the poor thing, lol, it just SITS at 95~100% CPU usage. XD"
02-11-2018T01:01:53,GhostPack24,Guys i am going to tell you all a short line the charaters are from twokinds but the lines are not so here i go
02-11-2018T01:02:02,Orionfire,I have a few games that do 90 %
02-11-2018T01:02:22,SageSaga,Do not spam my stream
02-11-2018T01:02:40,ZRO4825,"I was on it for a few hours one night, just to see how bad it got, at one point the whole system just blanked out entirely for about 2 seconds. I thought it just straight-up died for a moment."
02-11-2018T01:02:57,ZRO4825,"Decided at that point to stop playing MHW on it till I can upgrade the poor thing, lol."
02-11-2018T01:03:05,SageSaga,when was that Zro?
02-11-2018T01:03:50,ZRO4825,It's been....
02-11-2018T01:03:54,ZRO4825,lemme check
02-11-2018T01:03:55,BigSonicFan,Sorry if I ever accidentally spam the stream... I never try to do that. ^^;
02-11-2018T01:04:07,ZRO4825,almost 3 months ago
02-11-2018T01:04:20,ZRO4825,Last played: 8/23/18
02-11-2018T01:04:25,SageSaga,because an update has fixed a bit of that
02-11-2018T01:04:29,ZRO4825,"Okay, so more like, little over 2 months ago."
02-11-2018T01:04:30,ZRO4825,Oh?
02-11-2018T01:04:35,ZRO4825,:thinking:
02-11-2018T01:04:45,ZRO4825,Temptation...
02-11-2018T01:05:00,SageSaga,it used to be super CPU intensive but they fixed that a bit
02-11-2018T01:05:18,SageSaga,it still is a beast- but its a more tame beast
02-11-2018T01:05:53,ZRO4825,"Might not be so bad then, maybe I'll fire it up later tonight and see if it's a little less harsh on my old clunker here, lol"
02-11-2018T01:06:05,BigSonicFan,"This is looking amazing, Sage! <3"
02-11-2018T01:06:06,GhostPack24,Trace: i told you to put it here not there! Keith: no you said to put it there not her6e. Trace:well well well you know what i am out of here. Keith: well ok.
02-11-2018T01:06:11,Rosscoe,"Yea launch day was nuts, but my CPU was ok,"
02-11-2018T01:07:39,GhostPack24,Ok
02-11-2018T01:08:42,BigSonicFan,"@SageSaga, It looks like you're making a comic. ^^"
02-11-2018T01:08:56,SageSaga,ive been doing it for 15 years
02-11-2018T01:08:59,GhostPack24,Hello Any one here? Hello?
02-11-2018T01:09:13,GhostPack24,Never mind

02-11-2018T01:09:57,BigSonicFan,Sweet~! <3

02-11-2018T01:11:31,GhostPack24,Did you guys liked it?
02-11-2018T01:12:10,BigSonicFan,Oops... I'm confused... ^^;
02-11-2018T01:12:24,GhostPack24,Its ok
02-11-2018T01:12:25,BadFoMo,I didn't really get it.
02-11-2018T01:13:17,GhostPack24,What keith is moving is a table
02-11-2018T01:13:32,SageSaga,=_=

02-11-2018T01:15:54,GhostPack24,Are you talking about me?

02-11-2018T01:18:13,Bgrmystr2,that's one :triangular_flag_on_post:
02-11-2018T01:18:16,SageSaga,because when you speak to a child there is a different way of talking
02-11-2018T01:18:28,GhostPack24,Oh
02-11-2018T01:19:13,SageSaga,"A script is more than just dialogue. A script needs to explain a scene, not just what is said"
02-11-2018T01:19:31,SageSaga,people cant understand what they are talking about if you have no detail of the situation.
02-11-2018T01:19:41,GhostPack24,Oh got it
02-11-2018T01:20:30,SageSaga,"when we make dialogue posts- the dialogue needs to stand on its own- its what we call ""in a vacuum"" it means that without any other context it makes sense"
02-11-2018T01:21:30,GhostPack24,Ok
02-11-2018T01:22:29,SageSaga,if writing interests you theres a lot of books and videos on writing all over the net
02-11-2018T01:22:40,SageSaga,its worth the study if you are interested in it
02-11-2018T01:24:16,GhostPack24,My wifi got turned of
02-11-2018T01:24:58,Rosscoe,gazes upon the zoomed in chest
02-11-2018T01:25:05,ZRO4825,:eyes:
02-11-2018T01:25:13,GhostPack24,I am going to hit the sack gnight
02-11-2018T01:25:21,BadFoMo,Good night.
02-11-2018T01:25:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,ZOOM and enhance
02-11-2018T01:26:10,Rosscoe,night bad!
02-11-2018T01:26:53,SageSaga,XD
02-11-2018T01:33:56,baragorilla,Do you take requests?
02-11-2018T01:33:57,SageSaga,for those who cant see Purple
02-11-2018T01:34:11,SageSaga,Nope sorry no requests
02-11-2018T01:34:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hulk colors \o/
02-11-2018T01:35:43,BadFoMo,Can't see purple?
02-11-2018T01:35:45,ZRO4825,HULK PANTS!!!
02-11-2018T01:36:04,Rosscoe,"Hulk wearing a shirt but, no paints"
02-11-2018T01:36:20,Bgrmystr2,fairly sure noone wears paints usually.
02-11-2018T01:36:22,Bgrmystr2,that's not clothing
02-11-2018T01:36:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"""My name is Jonathon Comets, and this song is called hulk pants."""
02-11-2018T01:36:29,Bgrmystr2,unless it's japan
02-11-2018T01:36:42,Bgrmystr2,but japan's just weird.
02-11-2018T01:37:10,ZRO4825,"Lies, Bgr, women can away with walking around in bodypaints all day long"
02-11-2018T01:37:23,ZRO4825,Seen a video 'bout it once. :P
02-11-2018T01:38:00,Rosscoe,pants*
02-11-2018T01:40:26,SageSaga,back
02-11-2018T01:40:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,wb Sage
02-11-2018T01:40:44,SageSaga,most color blind people cant see Purple
02-11-2018T01:41:06,SageSaga,however- its not that they dont see something written there in purple- they just dont see it AS purple
02-11-2018T01:41:32,Bgrmystr2,"what color is it, some kinda grey?"
02-11-2018T01:41:59,SageSaga,nah- most color blind people see just other similar colors
02-11-2018T01:42:09,Bgrmystr2,hm okay
02-11-2018T01:42:25,SageSaga,color blindness doesnt actually mean everything is black and white to them
02-11-2018T01:42:56,SageSaga,it just means certain colors they dont see the same way- and might see Orange as just Red or Yellow more green
02-11-2018T01:43:29,Bgrmystr2,Yeah I know they don't see in just black&white I just was wondering since I'm not colorblind
02-11-2018T01:43:31,SageSaga,Purple is usually either Blue or red to many of them
02-11-2018T01:43:38,Bgrmystr2,hm
02-11-2018T01:43:40,Bgrmystr2,okay
02-11-2018T01:44:11,SageSaga,you can see videos of people who were color blind freaking out over purple when they wear color correcting glasses
02-11-2018T01:44:18,Bgrmystr2,"a couple people I saw online described the colors they couldn't see as a dark shade, kinda greyish"
02-11-2018T01:44:20,Bgrmystr2,yeah I know
02-11-2018T01:44:24,Bgrmystr2,those vids are great
02-11-2018T01:44:30,Bgrmystr2,I love them
02-11-2018T01:45:04,SageSaga,my dad is color blind
02-11-2018T01:46:17,SageSaga,"i remember as a kid asking him what color things were and he just avoided answering - but it never dawned on me- it wasnt until i was freak 17 years old when i was talking to him about a game and he asked about the Green units- and i was like ""Green?"""
02-11-2018T01:46:43,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: does he have the color correction glasses?
02-11-2018T01:46:47,SageSaga,nope
02-11-2018T01:46:47,Bgrmystr2,or are those expensive?
02-11-2018T01:46:54,SageSaga,they are expensive last i checked
02-11-2018T01:47:41,Mihari,$300+
02-11-2018T01:48:14,SageSaga,i would love to get a pair of those for my father but yeeeeah-
02-11-2018T01:48:24,Bgrmystr2,ah
02-11-2018T01:48:32,Bgrmystr2,not so bad I guess if you have 20/20 vision
02-11-2018T01:48:36,SageSaga,though tbh if i did he would probably be a lot more interested in my work and that would get weird
02-11-2018T01:49:04,Bgrmystr2,my glasses cost somewhere between $250 to $300 each lens
02-11-2018T01:49:10,Bgrmystr2,not including the frame
02-11-2018T01:49:18,Bgrmystr2,:/
02-11-2018T01:49:29,ZRO4825,lol
02-11-2018T01:49:46,SageSaga,do you have bifocal lenses?
02-11-2018T01:49:54,Bgrmystr2,no
02-11-2018T01:49:55,Bgrmystr2,I used to
02-11-2018T01:49:59,Bgrmystr2,but not anymore
02-11-2018T01:50:15,Rosscoe,I bought glass's t pass a visual test to do a road test I cant do cause vehcile papers arent orignal :/
02-11-2018T01:51:20,SageSaga,ive been wearing the same pair of glasses for like 16 years
02-11-2018T01:51:26,SageSaga,i need new ones
02-11-2018T01:52:12,Bgrmystr2,"I'm in the same boat, though not as much time I think.. maybe.. 12 13 years? possibly?"
02-11-2018T01:52:38,Bgrmystr2,my frame is from Oscar but i dunno when they sold this frame
02-11-2018T01:53:02,Rosscoe,"Ivee only used my glass's 5 times, I cant wear them long, the left lens made everything out of perspective and warpped, like beer googles, but everything is super clear on the fine print XD"
02-11-2018T01:53:15,SageSaga,there's an online store for lenses and glasses now that are cheap
02-11-2018T01:53:47,Rosscoe,I got mine online
02-11-2018T01:54:00,Rosscoe,"ZENNI, Chinese USA Company"
02-11-2018T01:54:26,Rosscoe,"25 buck glass's, but I wanted a good set so I spent 75bucks for protective coatings"
02-11-2018T01:54:59,Rosscoe,"I'm going to take them in to the shop down town at some point this year, get the lens checked, I think the left one is off a little too much"
02-11-2018T01:55:00,ZRO4825,I wanna go back to contacts again.
02-11-2018T01:55:06,ZRO4825,I hate not being able to wear sunglasses. :joy:
02-11-2018T01:55:47,SageSaga,why cant you wear sunglasses?
02-11-2018T01:56:24,ZRO4825,Cuz my normal glasses kinda get in the way?
02-11-2018T01:56:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,prescription sunglasses
02-11-2018T01:56:50,Bgrmystr2,"just get both, zro"
02-11-2018T01:56:52,Bgrmystr2,that's what I have
02-11-2018T01:57:12,SageSaga,prescription sunglasses or you can get a clip on
02-11-2018T01:57:24,Bgrmystr2,I have Transitions
02-11-2018T01:57:28,Bgrmystr2,mine just turn dark outside
02-11-2018T01:57:34,BadFoMo,There are sunglasses that can go over glasses.
02-11-2018T01:57:35,Bgrmystr2,never need sunglasses again.
02-11-2018T01:58:46,SageSaga,i thought they stopped making transition glasses - what with all the eye cancer
02-11-2018T01:58:50,Bgrmystr2,I can't find anyone with my glasses model online anymore :(
02-11-2018T01:59:35,Bgrmystr2,and.. fairly sure that's not a thing?
02-11-2018T01:59:45,SageSaga,it's not- good job
02-11-2018T01:59:47,SageSaga,XD
02-11-2018T01:59:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,sportrx still sell  transition glasses
02-11-2018T02:00:17,Bgrmystr2,"If they were to give ppl cancer, I'd be ded blind by now"
02-11-2018T02:00:41,Bgrmystr2,cuz I've been wearing transitions for almost two decades now? maybe 1 1/2?
02-11-2018T02:00:48,Bgrmystr2,don't remember when I first got a pair
02-11-2018T02:00:54,ZRO4825,"How do you know that's NOT your problem, Bgr? :P"
02-11-2018T02:01:17,Bgrmystr2,cuz I would have been told by the doctors that looked at my eyes :P
02-11-2018T02:01:23,Bgrmystr2,and I do go to checkups every so often
02-11-2018T02:02:03,ZRO4825,What if THEY don't know it's a problem? o.o
02-11-2018T02:02:14,SageSaga,brb i gotta cook a snack or something- im famished
02-11-2018T02:02:20,ZRO4825,"What if it's like, causin problems in your brain or somethin? O_o"
02-11-2018T02:02:45,Bgrmystr2,then.. I'm fairly sure they wouldn't be doctors for glasses
02-11-2018T02:02:45,Rosscoe,"I get enough problems with my eyes on these glass's,"
02-11-2018T02:03:07,Rosscoe,"Pain builds up in my right eye, and my left eye lens gives me an extreme case of motion sickness after 2 minutes, of just sitting"
02-11-2018T02:03:11,Bgrmystr2,"and even if I had cancer in my eyes, it wouldn't affect THEIR brains lol"
02-11-2018T02:03:16,Bgrmystr2,unless I were a zombie and bit them
02-11-2018T02:03:19,Bgrmystr2,"then, yknow."

02-11-2018T02:39:06,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-unimpressed: *Toyoko will remember that*
02-11-2018T02:39:07,SageSaga,Toyoko was based on 2 things
02-11-2018T02:39:13,ZRO4825,Lady Kaira?
02-11-2018T02:39:30,ZRO4825,Kayura? :thinking: Not sure how that was spelled off the top of my head.
02-11-2018T02:39:30,Kynum,Swords and Swords?
02-11-2018T02:39:57,SageSaga,Toyoko and Nami both were based on an old anime pair and a pair of real life people at first
02-11-2018T02:40:45,ZRO4825,:o
02-11-2018T02:41:11,ZRO4825,Well they didn't blow anything up yet that I'm aware of so it's not Dirty Pair...
02-11-2018T02:41:11,SageSaga,figure out the anime
02-11-2018T02:41:24,Kynum,lol
02-11-2018T02:41:37,Bgrmystr2,"lol that was my go-to zro, but I figured that wouldn't be it"
02-11-2018T02:41:45,Bgrmystr2,but I dunno anything so I couldn't guess
02-11-2018T02:41:49,ZRO4825,The ironic part is gonna be if I'm wrong...
02-11-2018T02:42:15,Kynum,Sword Art Online! :3
02-11-2018T02:42:35,ZRO4825,Ky's trying to get booted upside the head methinks. XD
02-11-2018T02:42:46,Kynum,;3
02-11-2018T02:42:49,Bgrmystr2,"well zro there are actually lots of pairs in anime, a lot of em were based on the dirty pair so"
02-11-2018T02:42:54,Bgrmystr2,it could be any of em
02-11-2018T02:43:02,SageSaga,5 years before the first SAO novel- yeeeeah
02-11-2018T02:43:11,ZRO4825,"Seriously though, guessing Lady Kayura, cuz her hairstyle fits Toyoko's."
02-11-2018T02:43:30,ZRO4825,I know Chobits was originally an influence on the android ladies cuz the ear cups
02-11-2018T02:43:30,LeRezwarrior,That gif really compels you to check out stream xd
02-11-2018T02:43:54,ZRO4825,lol
02-11-2018T02:44:17,ZRO4825,"As for Nami...I am honestly not quite sure what she would be based on, since I'm guessing she's NOT based on Nami from One Piece, lol"
02-11-2018T02:44:28,Bgrmystr2,"oh, the music finally rolled around to the beginning"
02-11-2018T02:44:49,SageSaga,they were based on a pair of characters from the same anime that worked together
02-11-2018T02:45:04,Bgrmystr2,yes that's not at all obvious lol
02-11-2018T02:45:20,Mihari,"Fun fact, a lot of Yosh's cast is based off actual people."
02-11-2018T02:45:55,ZRO4825,"Oh...well damnit, Sage. Now I'm not sure at all, lol."
02-11-2018T02:46:07,SageSaga,yet Phil is actually twice removed from me
02-11-2018T02:46:17,Mihari,Except in name XD
02-11-2018T02:46:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,poor phil
02-11-2018T02:46:18,ZRO4825,Only female pair I can think of off the top of my head is Dirty Pair and that doesn't seem to fit them. :thinking:
02-11-2018T02:46:59,SageSaga,the anime Title is totally something you would expect i would like
02-11-2018T02:48:48,Kynum,Saga of the Sages
02-11-2018T02:49:18,ZRO4825,I admit I am totally at a loss here. ;_;
02-11-2018T02:50:14,SageSaga,you need more culture
02-11-2018T02:50:40,ZRO4825,"I don't deny this. Much of my childhood was NES or SNES time, lol."
02-11-2018T02:50:55,SageSaga,that was a hint
02-11-2018T02:51:03,Kynum,...robotech?
02-11-2018T02:51:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,owo robotech
02-11-2018T02:51:16,Kynum,"wait, that was protoculture"
02-11-2018T02:52:12,ZRO4825,"That....was a not helpful hint for me at all. And I'm probably gonna feel dumb once you tell us what it is, lol"
02-11-2018T02:52:55,BadFoMo,What was the hint?
02-11-2018T02:53:05,Kynum,"that we need more culture, I think"
02-11-2018T02:53:10,ZRO4825,"That we need more culture, yup"
02-11-2018T02:53:15,SageSaga,all the culture
02-11-2018T02:53:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I could use 5% more culture

02-11-2018T02:57:57,BadFoMo,*Monster
02-11-2018T02:57:58,ZRO4825,Because I can't ever remember the name of random stuff for crap. ;_; lol
02-11-2018T02:58:00,Bgrmystr2,"lol the ""Hey!"" mid-song is great every time I hear it xD"

02-11-2018T02:58:49,ZRO4825,"He said movie, not series. :P"

02-11-2018T03:01:14,SageSaga,you could probably google all the clues and get it
02-11-2018T03:01:56,ZRO4825,I tried. I got results trying to teach me about lesbian animes.
02-11-2018T03:02:10,Kynum,All purpose cultural catgirl
02-11-2018T03:02:29,SageSaga,bout time- do you feel sad now Zro?!

02-11-2018T03:02:35,ZRO4825,When was this?
02-11-2018T03:02:48,BadFoMo,Inb4 Sage: ...(Sigh) Look; this is a little in the right derection. This is sort of right. You are over THERE! You took a bus or something!
02-11-2018T03:02:48,SageSaga,like a year ago
02-11-2018T03:02:56,ZRO4825,"And honestly, not as sad as I would've. I know OF Nuku Nuku. I have never personally seen it."
02-11-2018T03:03:22,SageSaga,https://cdn.animeapi.com/images/1/df36dae4_352x220.jpg
02-11-2018T03:03:25,ZRO4825,"Did you manage to show it on like, the one stream I missed or something? lol"
02-11-2018T03:03:44,Bgrmystr2,fuck's sake I can't type if chat keeps disconnecting every 5 mins for 5 mins -_-
02-11-2018T03:03:55,Kynum,yes you can.
02-11-2018T03:03:56,ZRO4825,"o_O; Stop breaking your chat, Bgr!"
02-11-2018T03:03:57,Bgrmystr2,"and yeah I knew of Nuku Nuku but I don't know if any ""pair"" from the anime"
02-11-2018T03:04:00,Bgrmystr2,It's NOT ME
02-11-2018T03:04:01,Kynum,It just won't do anything
02-11-2018T03:04:24,SageSaga,i posted a link to a picture of the pair
02-11-2018T03:04:30,ZRO4825,"Mine's not breaking, Bgr! lol"
02-11-2018T03:04:32,Bgrmystr2,"Maybe I'll come by and break yer face and blame it on you, zro. Basically what's happenin to my chat right now"
02-11-2018T03:04:46,ZRO4825,XD
02-11-2018T03:05:09,ZRO4825,"And yeah, Sage, I looked at it, I don't recognize those two at ALL, lol"
02-11-2018T03:05:09,Bgrmystr2,Yeah sage I do not remember them
02-11-2018T03:05:23,BadFoMo,Who are they?
02-11-2018T03:05:26,Kynum,what was the original thought?
02-11-2018T03:05:27,SageSaga,they were the office girls always sent off to take out Nuku Nuku
02-11-2018T03:05:46,BadFoMo,Who?
02-11-2018T03:05:50,Bgrmystr2,"I know of Nuku, I don't recall the guy she was w/ but that she was with some guy.."
02-11-2018T03:05:53,Bgrmystr2,and that's it
02-11-2018T03:05:59,Bgrmystr2,jesus Fomo can you follow a conversation
02-11-2018T03:06:03,Bgrmystr2,like at all
02-11-2018T03:06:11,BadFoMo,...Maybe?
02-11-2018T03:06:22,Bgrmystr2,30%? lol
02-11-2018T03:06:54,Kynum,OH! Percentages! I'm good at these! 10% >:3
02-11-2018T03:07:03,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's probably more accurate Kynum
02-11-2018T03:07:10,Bgrmystr2,but I didn't wanna be mean
02-11-2018T03:07:13,BadFoMo,Of what?
02-11-2018T03:07:16,Kynum,I meant me
02-11-2018T03:07:24,ZRO4825,lol
02-11-2018T03:07:29,Bgrmystr2,"Oh, no you're more like 60+% Kynum"
02-11-2018T03:07:34,Kynum,...
02-11-2018T03:07:40,Kynum,:ptv-excited:
02-11-2018T03:07:41,SageSaga,Arisa Sono and Kyouko Ariyoshi
02-11-2018T03:08:17,SageSaga,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6JNhdih8E-A/hqdefault.jpg
02-11-2018T03:09:09,Bgrmystr2,I think I watched.. the episode or two that came with .. oh god damn what was that magazine uhh
02-11-2018T03:09:11,Bgrmystr2,NewType
02-11-2018T03:09:18,Bgrmystr2,back when they had subscriptions
02-11-2018T03:09:23,Bgrmystr2,and then the magazine died entirely
02-11-2018T03:09:25,Kynum,Well that was fun. I'll see you guys later.
02-11-2018T03:09:25,BadFoMo,I don't remember that one.
02-11-2018T03:09:32,BadFoMo,Bye.
02-11-2018T03:09:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,see ya Ky
02-11-2018T03:09:38,Bgrmystr2,seeya Kynum
02-11-2018T03:09:54,Bgrmystr2,Newtype was what.. 2005? Something to that effect
02-11-2018T03:10:04,Bgrmystr2,give or take a few years
02-11-2018T03:10:09,Bgrmystr2,but that's when I was getting em
02-11-2018T03:10:26,Bgrmystr2,"and one of em had Nuku Nuku on the CD, which was the only episodes I ever saw"
02-11-2018T03:10:35,Bgrmystr2,cuz I never could see it anywhere else
02-11-2018T03:10:41,Bgrmystr2,fast forward to now.
02-11-2018T03:11:15,SageSaga,it was probably Nuku Nuku Dash and not the original OVA
02-11-2018T03:11:29,Bgrmystr2,lemmy check
02-11-2018T03:11:57,Bgrmystr2,no actually it wasn't
02-11-2018T03:12:10,SageSaga,Nuku Nuku TV?
02-11-2018T03:12:22,Bgrmystr2,yeah I believe so
02-11-2018T03:12:24,ZRO4825,"I haven't seen any of the Nuku Nuku stuff myself, lol"
02-11-2018T03:12:43,SageSaga,the original is All Purpose Cultural Cat Girl Nuku Nuku OVA
02-11-2018T03:13:43,Bgrmystr2,it was the 2004 edition and the DVD that came with the magazine came with the original series 1st episode
02-11-2018T03:14:08,Bgrmystr2,I've got a link to someone sellin that magazine vol on ebay if you wanna see :u
02-11-2018T03:14:36,Bgrmystr2,but yeah it was definitely the original series cuz I'd recognise that lil pink haired cat
02-11-2018T03:15:03,SageSaga,Nuku Nuku TV is not the same as the original OVA but it is closer than Dash-
02-11-2018T03:15:09,SageSaga,which was- ... a thing
02-11-2018T03:15:28,Bgrmystr2,hm
02-11-2018T03:15:35,ZRO4825,lol
02-11-2018T03:15:42,ZRO4825,"I always worry when something is ""...a thing"""
02-11-2018T03:15:45,Bgrmystr2,okay well it was TV and it had the same character style as the original rather than Dash
02-11-2018T03:16:03,Bgrmystr2,but that's about as far as I got
02-11-2018T03:16:05,Bgrmystr2,xD
02-11-2018T03:16:15,Bgrmystr2,I prolly have the dvd somewhere.. no idea where tho
02-11-2018T03:19:55,Rosscoe,"ok guys im gona go shower, might as well extra fresh for work, knowing hte lack of sleep :P"
02-11-2018T03:19:59,Rosscoe,Laters now!
02-11-2018T03:20:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,See ya Ross
02-11-2018T03:21:46,Bgrmystr2,ah gnight ross
02-11-2018T03:21:47,SageSaga,Toyoko and Nami were also based on 2 girls at a nearby restaurant- i visited - they teased each other a lot and were really nice - its where Nami gets her southern accent
02-11-2018T03:22:18,ZRO4825,I always kinda forget she's supposed to have that.
02-11-2018T03:22:54,SageSaga,the girl tried to hide it at work but it always slipped out when she was more casual or got angry
02-11-2018T03:22:59,ZRO4825,lol
02-11-2018T03:23:34,Bgrmystr2,lolol
02-11-2018T03:24:48,SageSaga,i guess im done- im just gonna paint the background so no reason to do it now
02-11-2018T03:25:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Very well done Sage
02-11-2018T03:25:10,BadFoMo,Cool.
02-11-2018T03:25:10,SageSaga,peace folks! thanks for joining!
02-11-2018T03:25:21,Bgrmystr2,thanks for streamin sage :D!
02-11-2018T03:25:25,Bgrmystr2,page looks interesting
02-11-2018T03:25:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Nighty night sage, thanks for the teamy"
02-11-2018T03:25:27,BadFoMo,Bue. Thanks for the stream.
02-11-2018T03:25:30,SageSaga,10 hours and 30 minutes from now- the stream will begin again
02-11-2018T03:25:34,BadFoMo,*Bye
02-11-2018T03:25:36,Bgrmystr2,I dunno what's with the green squares but
02-11-2018T03:25:39,Bgrmystr2,yes.
02-11-2018T03:25:43,SageSaga,masking
02-11-2018T03:26:01,Bgrmystr2,"..yes, I don't know what that is. :ptv-sad:"
02-11-2018T03:26:02,SageSaga,unless you mean the grid
02-11-2018T03:26:14,Bgrmystr2,I don't see a grid
02-11-2018T03:26:16,ZRO4825,"Nope, I think he means the green screens, lol"
02-11-2018T03:26:37,Bgrmystr2,OH that grid
02-11-2018T03:26:46,Bgrmystr2,"no, I was just thinking of the green"
02-11-2018T03:27:00,Bgrmystr2,the grid is obviously some kind of perspective type thing
02-11-2018T03:27:08,Bgrmystr2,for distance
02-11-2018T03:27:15,SageSaga,the reason for the green is so i could make the grid- but it will also be how i do the backgrounds without messing with the back layer
02-11-2018T03:27:18,ZRO4825,"TY! Fuck's sake, my brain was just REFUSING to come up with the word perspective."
02-11-2018T03:27:31,Bgrmystr2,haha np zro
02-11-2018T03:27:44,Bgrmystr2,"save it in a folder called ""Words I fucking forget"""
02-11-2018T03:27:58,Bgrmystr2,I've got one
02-11-2018T03:28:02,Bgrmystr2,comes in handy
02-11-2018T03:28:07,ZRO4825,"I've literally for like two minutes been sitting here going ""The grid is for..for.....for....it's not resolution.....it's.....FUCK"""
02-11-2018T03:28:16,Bgrmystr2,xD
02-11-2018T03:28:28,SageSaga,have ya heard of Masking tape?
02-11-2018T03:28:42,Bgrmystr2,"and thanks sage. I know of that, but I dunno what it's for"
02-11-2018T03:28:49,Bgrmystr2,I've never really used it or seen anyone use it
02-11-2018T03:28:54,SageSaga,wow
02-11-2018T03:29:01,Bgrmystr2,so I dunno anything other than it exists :ptv-confused:
02-11-2018T03:29:20,SageSaga,masking tape is tape that isnt really for binding or holding something together- it has a weak adhesive to take it off of things
02-11-2018T03:29:39,sunblaze,take care and sleep well everyone
02-11-2018T03:29:39,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
02-11-2018T03:29:40,SageSaga,"its used to ""Mask out"" an area for painting!"
02-11-2018T03:29:54,Bgrmystr2,seeya sun
02-11-2018T03:30:09,SageSaga,so you want a nice clean line? mask out the area- paint- take the tape off and you have a perfect line!
02-11-2018T03:30:31,Bgrmystr2,OH that's when they like.. tape cars and shit before painting
02-11-2018T03:30:37,SageSaga,yep!
02-11-2018T03:30:41,Bgrmystr2,okay yeah I never knew what that was but I've seen that
02-11-2018T03:30:41,SageSaga,that is masking tape
02-11-2018T03:30:42,Bgrmystr2,okay
02-11-2018T03:31:01,Bgrmystr2,on the same page yay
02-11-2018T03:31:05,SageSaga,and masking something is putting something down so you dont go over it or to make sure you only go over it
02-11-2018T03:31:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"that reminds me, I got more painting to do on my car.....rip"
02-11-2018T03:31:24,Bgrmystr2,so it's just a digital version of that
02-11-2018T03:31:35,SageSaga,yep- you see people making selections right?
02-11-2018T03:31:40,SageSaga,thats a form of masking too
02-11-2018T03:31:40,Bgrmystr2,yeah
02-11-2018T03:31:44,Bgrmystr2,ooh okay
02-11-2018T03:31:55,SageSaga,flat colors are often also masking!
02-11-2018T03:32:06,Bgrmystr2,I figure layers is the easiest and most robust way to separate stuff
02-11-2018T03:32:19,Bgrmystr2,but I know ya can't make everything a different layer
02-11-2018T03:32:28,SageSaga,you sorta can-
02-11-2018T03:32:33,SageSaga,but it is inefficient
02-11-2018T03:32:44,Bgrmystr2,yeah you'd end up with like hundreds of em
02-11-2018T03:32:57,SageSaga,i already end up with 50-60 sometimes XD
02-11-2018T03:33:00,ZRO4825,LIKE ME!
02-11-2018T03:33:09,ZRO4825,Or at least like I would end up doing if I'd quit being a lazy shit and art.
02-11-2018T03:33:19,Bgrmystr2,I was thinking like 500-600+ or somethin
02-11-2018T03:33:50,Bgrmystr2,I know that getting about 100 or so is fairly normal if an image is complex.. from what I've gathered over watching artists for the past few years
02-11-2018T03:34:17,Bgrmystr2,"I guess it varies, but yeah okay I get it"
02-11-2018T03:34:44,Bgrmystr2,"one of those things I just never saw before, or don't remember"
02-11-2018T03:35:06,Bgrmystr2,thanks for the 'splain lucy
02-11-2018T03:35:08,Bgrmystr2,I mean sage xD

02-11-2018T12:17:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"Besides when it comes to waxing, not sure if Tom’d know how to plan that one out for a sketch"
02-11-2018T12:18:15,Ordithus,I wasn't going to suggest it

02-11-2018T12:18:58,Ordithus,Many many things I'd rather see first than Raine in agony
02-11-2018T12:20:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Maren walking in on Raine shower karaoke

02-11-2018T13:25:38,Bgrmystr2,likely a well-deserved escape from what hell waking up early is.

02-11-2018T14:01:58,GhostPack24,😢
02-11-2018T14:04:48,SageSaga,does just having a youtube channel make you a youtuber? because if so- i think a lot of us are...
02-11-2018T14:05:26,GhostPack24,I have made vidz
02-11-2018T14:06:21,Mippy,Hello!
02-11-2018T14:06:26,GhostPack24,And having a youtube acount does nt make you a youtuber
02-11-2018T14:06:29,Ordithus,You Mippy
02-11-2018T14:06:32,Ordithus,*Yo
02-11-2018T14:06:33,Ordithus,haha
02-11-2018T14:06:34,SageSaga,hey Mippy!
02-11-2018T14:07:09,Bgrmystr2,just making a few videos doesn't make you a youtuber either btw

02-11-2018T14:07:45,Ordithus,"Dang, get well soon"
02-11-2018T14:08:05,SageSaga,"As for ""Youtubers"" I would define one as - someone whom makes a living doing youtube videos"
02-11-2018T14:08:33,ZRO4825,"And if you're 14 as you've claimed, somehow i doubt you're making a living off of it."
02-11-2018T14:08:50,Mippy,I agree with Sage.
02-11-2018T14:08:59,GhostPack24,I go live on youtube and i might go live today?
02-11-2018T14:09:06,SageSaga,you would be an Aspiring Youtuber
02-11-2018T14:09:11,Mippy,Even though I have no idea what is going on...
02-11-2018T14:10:04,GhostPack24,I am only 14 years old btw
02-11-2018T14:11:06,SageSaga,my 6 year old nephew wants to be a youtuber

02-11-2018T14:11:59,ZRO4825,"by the time he's old enough to pull it off Youtube will probably be a dead thing, lol"
02-11-2018T14:12:00,SageSaga,because they get to scream all the time and their mommy doesnt yell at them for it
02-11-2018T14:12:10,Mippy,Cute

02-11-2018T14:23:53,Ordithus,She always ends up taking the glory
02-11-2018T14:23:55,SageSaga,there are female goblins in Rune Aria so it's not like Goblin Slayer- there can be good goblins
02-11-2018T14:24:09,Ordithus,Getting the final blows on all the bosses

02-11-2018T14:58:42,Bgrmystr2,they're kinda the same as legos but without the whole.. bricks and studs and stuff
02-11-2018T14:58:45,MatyMaty,now gives me an idea. Kaylin should wear a goblin loincloth
02-11-2018T14:58:46,Ordithus,:csagesaga-c3: Good use of your time
02-11-2018T14:58:49,MatyMaty,and just that :v

02-11-2018T14:59:57,SageSaga,not for patreon - but i could draw it XD
02-11-2018T14:59:58,Ordithus,As long as she can wear something more substantial than a goblin top
02-11-2018T15:00:01,Bgrmystr2,cuz topless
02-11-2018T15:00:03,ZRO4825,We're already in trouble for bikini-clad Toyokos! :P
02-11-2018T15:00:07,Bgrmystr2,and we can't have topless
02-11-2018T15:00:14,Bgrmystr2,exactly
02-11-2018T15:00:17,Bgrmystr2,zro knows
02-11-2018T15:00:20,Mippy,"Well, see ya later. Gotta go punch in."
02-11-2018T15:00:24,Ordithus,see ya
02-11-2018T15:00:28,Ordithus,ZRO was the cause
02-11-2018T15:00:29,SageSaga,ive drawn Kaylin Topless- ive drawn her naked
02-11-2018T15:00:32,SageSaga,several times
02-11-2018T15:00:39,ZRO4825,"I mean, I'M okay with topless. Patreon just seems to disagree. :P"
02-11-2018T15:00:49,GhostPack24,Really
02-11-2018T15:00:52,Bgrmystr2,Ribbons disagree too :V
02-11-2018T15:01:01,GhostPack24,?
02-11-2018T15:01:24,Nekonny,"Hum, would the game have a maturity filter?"
02-11-2018T15:01:32,MatyMaty,Drawww it XD
02-11-2018T15:01:35,MatyMaty,also
02-11-2018T15:01:36,BadFoMo,Does anyone else see the lines as the poligons that make up the world/the Matrix breaking/glitching out?
02-11-2018T15:01:37,Bgrmystr2,"which game, ron"
02-11-2018T15:01:41,MatyMaty,"you are still at +18, sage?"
02-11-2018T15:01:50,Nekonny,like the sims
02-11-2018T15:01:50,Ordithus,"The AI game, bgr"
02-11-2018T15:01:59,SageSaga,yeah
02-11-2018T15:02:04,Nekonny,the game from sages comic
02-11-2018T15:02:06,SageSaga,its been like 3 months now
02-11-2018T15:02:13,BigSonicFan,"@BadFoMo, I'm doing good too. Sorry about that, I'm working on a Sonic Fighting Game for Scratch. ^^"
02-11-2018T15:02:24,BadFoMo,Cool!
02-11-2018T15:02:40,SageSaga,also - Kaylin has confirmed the mature thing is gone in the game- she admitted to ... masturbation!
02-11-2018T15:02:44,MatyMaty,Mmmmm
02-11-2018T15:02:54,Bgrmystr2,but would it be all pixelated
02-11-2018T15:02:58,Bgrmystr2,I guess
02-11-2018T15:03:01,MatyMaty,"well, I did read somewhere that this was a general thing"
02-11-2018T15:03:03,BadFoMo,...Wat?
02-11-2018T15:03:07,Nekonny,and heya maty ^^
02-11-2018T15:03:10,MatyMaty,so chances are you will stay at +18
02-11-2018T15:03:13,MatyMaty,Hey Neko
02-11-2018T15:03:14,Ordithus,But you had to get in on the game before it all went to hell
02-11-2018T15:03:15,SageSaga,a lot of people didnt catch that XD
02-11-2018T15:03:29,BigSonicFan,"Hi, Maty! ^^/"
02-11-2018T15:03:39,SageSaga,in the last chapter Kaylin said it was possible
02-11-2018T15:03:52,ZRO4825,lol
02-11-2018T15:03:56,SageSaga,previously the game didnt allow for stuff like that
02-11-2018T15:04:10,SageSaga,and in this chapter there's sex
02-11-2018T15:04:23,Rosscoe,"ok im going to go make some food then go to bed, catch yes all later!"
02-11-2018T15:04:28,Ordithus,bye Ross
02-11-2018T15:04:40,Nekonny,behind the scenes?
02-11-2018T15:04:41,BigSonicFan,"See ya, Ross! ^^/"
02-11-2018T15:04:47,BadFoMo,...What would the game do if a user tried to do something like that?
02-11-2018T15:05:10,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-ohmy:
02-11-2018T15:05:12,Ordithus,"Not really much, it seems.  Just work."
02-11-2018T15:05:26,Ordithus,The developers had some... extra time
02-11-2018T15:06:17,SageSaga,in the original game you would get a warning that if you didnt stop the inappropriate action you would be banned
02-11-2018T15:06:59,BadFoMo,Just a warning and Banning?
02-11-2018T15:07:02,Bgrmystr2,spying much lool
02-11-2018T15:07:06,BadFoMo,*banning
02-11-2018T15:07:07,SageSaga,also sensation would be removed so a person interacted with in an unwanted or warranted way wouldnt feel the discomfort
02-11-2018T15:07:33,Nekonny,seems like a way to get ejected from the game back to the real world
02-11-2018T15:07:40,Ordithus,Just the incredible akwardness and psychological horrors
02-11-2018T15:08:41,SageSaga,so if you were a female in the game and someone just grabbed your boob- it would feel like someone bumped into your more than anything else- that person would get a warning and if it was an accident they could avoid or stop it- if it wasnt then they would
02-11-2018T15:08:45,SageSaga,be banned- simple
02-11-2018T15:09:04,BadFoMo,I was thinking that users had non-removable/painted on underwear or Barbie/Ken doll anatomy.
02-11-2018T15:09:53,Nekonny,Hum models gonna take forever... I'll finish it later
02-11-2018T15:10:02,Bgrmystr2,ay it's tom :D
02-11-2018T15:10:08,FoxxTrotter,:0)
02-11-2018T15:10:14,SageSaga,nudity would be in the game if you turned it on - otherwise - yes- they would always have underwear on

02-11-2018T15:27:12,Ordithus,"Not that kind of art here, swizzle"
02-11-2018T15:27:16,Twokinds,It usually happens with a poof.
02-11-2018T15:27:24,Bgrmystr2,ah
02-11-2018T15:27:31,Twokinds,Much easier to draw
02-11-2018T15:27:36,Nekonny,but... I can't recall a scenario where there is no poof!
02-11-2018T15:27:42,Bgrmystr2,yeah cuz you only draw the before and after

02-11-2018T16:55:16,CrRAR,"(though, the symbolism here)"
02-11-2018T16:55:16,Bgrmystr2,he is definitely not drowning
02-11-2018T16:55:28,Ordithus,He's not even that blue
02-11-2018T16:55:31,sunblaze,get food you 2! or you might faint and miss parts of the stream
02-11-2018T16:55:36,Bgrmystr2,"that is a very nice shot too, tom :ok_hand:"
02-11-2018T16:56:20,GhostPack24,I hate my life
02-11-2018T16:56:36,Bgrmystr2,"you and many others, so I'm told."
02-11-2018T16:56:38,GhostPack24,XP
02-11-2018T16:56:52,Bgrmystr2,you should try not doing that.
02-11-2018T16:57:16,GhostPack24,I all ready did XP
02-11-2018T16:57:31,ZRO4825,I tried not doing that.
02-11-2018T16:57:32,GhostPack24,It didn't work
02-11-2018T16:57:34,ZRO4825,It was a good day.
02-11-2018T16:57:49,Twokinds,Thanks!
02-11-2018T16:57:56,RimaDraws,yea it looks nice
02-11-2018T16:58:03,sunblaze,live a littl! buy stupid useless stuff like sweets :ptv-excited: or furry art commisions
02-11-2018T16:58:14,sunblaze,that brighten your live and makes it happy again!
02-11-2018T16:58:17,ZRO4825,"I already do that, Sunblaze. :joy:"
02-11-2018T16:58:19,Bgrmystr2,I can't tell if it's mike's reflection or an underwater shot looking up at mike
02-11-2018T16:58:22,RimaDraws,some people have bills to pay sun
02-11-2018T16:58:23,Bgrmystr2,"but either way, both are cool"
02-11-2018T16:58:31,RimaDraws,oh reflection
02-11-2018T16:58:31,ZRO4825,"Reflection, Bgr. Look at the chest along the bottom of the image~"
02-11-2018T16:58:36,Bgrmystr2,"yes I know, Zro"
02-11-2018T16:58:43,sunblaze,I did not say every time al day long. just every now and then
02-11-2018T16:58:53,GhostPack24,I am an emorltel
02-11-2018T16:58:53,Bgrmystr2,that doesn't make it one or the other lol
02-11-2018T16:59:03,Bgrmystr2,it would look that way underwater as well.
02-11-2018T16:59:13,ZRO4825,chest would be more of a discolored blue underwater though~
02-11-2018T16:59:17,CrRAR,true
02-11-2018T16:59:21,Bgrmystr2,"not with clear water, no it wouldn't xD"
02-11-2018T16:59:56,ZRO4825,at the very least it would be discolored because underwater light gets funky. And at the very least causes distortions.
02-11-2018T17:00:09,ZRO4825,I said very least too much
02-11-2018T17:00:17,ZRO4825,I hate my brain working so much faster than my fingers.
02-11-2018T17:00:19,RimaDraws,light reflects off water and it causes the pigment in the water
02-11-2018T17:00:25,RimaDraws,hence blue color i believe
02-11-2018T17:00:27,Bgrmystr2,you should at least vary your verys. :P
02-11-2018T17:00:34,Nekonny,you guys are overthinking it
02-11-2018T17:00:35,CrRAR,We don't know which way is up... much like Mike with where he's at in life.
02-11-2018T17:00:37,ZRO4825,It likes to repeat itself while I'm typing and then I end up repeating what I'm typing.
02-11-2018T17:00:38,CrRAR,poetic
02-11-2018T17:00:50,Ordithus,Seemed pretty obvious
02-11-2018T17:00:58,Ordithus,Even in the sketch
02-11-2018T17:00:59,RimaDraws,*is confused*
02-11-2018T17:01:02,ZRO4825,"Ron, we overthink everything. From water colors, to reflection, to tails, and even boobs. :P"
02-11-2018T17:01:11,ZRO4825,We are picarto chat. And overthinking is what we do best. ^_^
02-11-2018T17:01:12,Bgrmystr2,Zro works at the Redundancy Dept of Redundancy.
02-11-2018T17:01:12,RimaDraws,im an art student so

02-11-2018T17:02:19,Nekonny,it's easy to say it when you're not doing it
02-11-2018T17:02:24,MatyMaty,That was overthinking too XD

02-11-2018T17:04:02,Bgrmystr2,lol Maty 56% of 75%.. so 42% opacity?
02-11-2018T17:04:07,Ordithus,Other way around might not go as well
02-11-2018T17:04:21,MatyMaty,I mean 56% or 75% :P
02-11-2018T17:04:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t get motion sick

02-11-2018T17:34:49,Bgrmystr2,"it's also a female symbol, kiwi"
02-11-2018T17:34:56,Bgrmystr2,right after the shrug
02-11-2018T17:34:59,CrRAR,lol
02-11-2018T17:35:03,Tharkis,kaboom!
02-11-2018T17:35:08,Tharkis,kitty cauldron is <3
02-11-2018T17:35:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Because my keyboard defaults to female emojis
02-11-2018T17:35:15,SpazztasticKiwi,When it applies
02-11-2018T17:35:15,CrRAR,a shrug most feminine~
02-11-2018T17:35:26,sunblaze,:D
02-11-2018T17:35:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Because it’s owner - me - is female
02-11-2018T17:35:41,Bgrmystr2,the shrug image is already female though.. why need the symbol?
02-11-2018T17:35:51,BizarreSlav,BECAUSE
02-11-2018T17:35:53,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
02-11-2018T17:36:00,TerraTheWizard,devices with gendered emotes use the symbol to change the emote
02-11-2018T17:36:02,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s how Picarto translates them
02-11-2018T17:36:05,RimaDraws,i really like this one nekonny <3
02-11-2018T17:36:07,TerraTheWizard,otherwise it just gets split out
02-11-2018T17:36:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Like the male is 🤷‍♂️
02-11-2018T17:36:20,Bgrmystr2,clearly guys and girls shrug differently to picarto
02-11-2018T17:36:22,Bgrmystr2,rofl
02-11-2018T17:36:25,TerraTheWizard,like the skintone ones giving the default yellow person & a coloured square
02-11-2018T17:36:30,Bgrmystr2,wtf kinda fail post

02-11-2018T17:36:42,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's some really bad emoji translation
02-11-2018T17:37:32,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s two different bamboo emojis 🎍🎋

02-11-2018T17:37:48,TerraTheWizard,i think the issue is the unicode emotes aren't gendered

02-11-2018T17:50:46,Ordithus,Smaller than Natani and Zen at least

02-11-2018T18:10:04,qwe304,"did a giveaway for an artbook once, bgr won that iirc"
02-11-2018T18:10:36,HobbitGames,"Jeez, how good could it be?"

02-11-2018T18:11:54,HobbitGames,I doubt nobody hasnt posted pics of the entirety of it
02-11-2018T18:12:19,Bgrmystr2,"no Hobbit, I mean images used for the artbook itself from something that tom already posted online"
02-11-2018T18:12:28,HobbitGames,Ahh ok lol
02-11-2018T18:12:33,qwe304,nothing of respectable quality @hobbitgames

02-11-2018T18:14:50,Bgrmystr2,She's ahead of some ppl
02-11-2018T18:15:03,HobbitGames,Hahaha. Im constantly worried about my parents seeing me watch his syreams. I wouldnt want them reading th e comics.
02-11-2018T18:15:15,RimaDraws,why are you worried
02-11-2018T18:15:26,HobbitGames,Idk. In case they get the wrong idea
02-11-2018T18:15:29,Bgrmystr2,"eh, my parents know. they aren't worried about it"
02-11-2018T18:15:29,RimaDraws,please
02-11-2018T18:15:31,Mippy,I think she was a bit iffy about Trace getting Flora knocked up. She said it was “different”
02-11-2018T18:15:52,RimaDraws,i don't involve my parents in anything i do art wise unless its something they know im working on
02-11-2018T18:15:59,RimaDraws,but then again im 31 and out of the house
02-11-2018T18:16:13,qwe304,heres a close up of the signed print https://imgur.com/a/67Od69s

02-11-2018T18:16:29,Bgrmystr2,just cuz you're out of the house doesn't prevent your parents from seeing art that you're into lol
02-11-2018T18:16:45,Bgrmystr2,rofl tom please xD

02-11-2018T18:17:43,Mippy,I’m still waiting for my print to ship. :ctwokinds-sadtrace2: so exited though
02-11-2018T18:17:49,RimaDraws,they support my art endeavors all the way
02-11-2018T18:17:54,unsteddyphoenix,"I like that when Evals pictures Eric in his mind, it's him doing the thinking pose"
02-11-2018T18:18:03,RimaDraws,they know im the only child in the family to like anime and draw it
02-11-2018T18:18:27,RimaDraws,so im the strange child to my sister lol
02-11-2018T18:18:37,CrRAR,haha

02-11-2018T18:18:47,qwe304,"my sis tried to rat me out when she saw me watching a stream, but mu mom gave 0 fucks"
02-11-2018T18:18:48,Ordithus,I like how Flora's dripping on him
02-11-2018T18:18:53,Ordithus,She broke the universe
02-11-2018T18:19:20,RimaDraws,i just seriously don't tell my family anything since some of us aren't that close to each other sadly....
02-11-2018T18:19:34,CrRAR,"This ""gal"" Eric knows... is it the sister who keeps a right jolly crew of Keidran?"
02-11-2018T18:19:37,HobbitGames,"I tried to get my brother to start resding it, but if its not something he 100% wants to do himself, he fefuses to do it"
02-11-2018T18:20:09,HobbitGames,That's sad Rima. I hate it when family members grow apart
02-11-2018T18:20:27,unsteddyphoenix,Thats my hope Cr
02-11-2018T18:20:27,RimaDraws,well there was the divorce of my parents and since then my family is scattered
02-11-2018T18:20:29,HobbitGames,"Well, not apart, but ""not particularly close"""
02-11-2018T18:20:32,RimaDraws,a lot more problems too...
02-11-2018T18:20:37,HobbitGames,"Oh, i dee"
02-11-2018T18:20:39,HobbitGames,See*
02-11-2018T18:20:44,RimaDraws,my parents were together 24 years then split
02-11-2018T18:20:59,RimaDraws,after all the stuff they put us through with their arguining
02-11-2018T18:21:07,RimaDraws,but
02-11-2018T18:21:10,RimaDraws,i digress...
02-11-2018T18:21:45,RimaDraws,arguing omg keys
02-11-2018T18:21:47,HobbitGames,"Thankfully, my parents never argue too much, and never really badly"
02-11-2018T18:21:53,RimaDraws,well this was bad
02-11-2018T18:22:04,RimaDraws,it started long before i was born and it wasn't good
02-11-2018T18:22:20,Mippy,My immediate family is together. I barley know my extended family. You know...parents can’t divorce if they were never married to begin with.
02-11-2018T18:22:21,HobbitGames,"Plus, they only had two kids. Me and my twin. Haha must be hell"
02-11-2018T18:22:55,RimaDraws,i have two siblings and three step siblings
02-11-2018T18:23:05,RimaDraws,one is considered a sibling so four
02-11-2018T18:23:08,Mippy,Not that we never had our problems. It was pretty bad for awhile
02-11-2018T18:23:18,HobbitGames,"Im very close with all of my aunts, uncles and cousins (especially on mothers side), i guess im lucky to be so close to all of my family"
02-11-2018T18:24:35,RimaDraws,the only one im close to is my dad sadly...
02-11-2018T18:24:43,RimaDraws,ugh i need to stop.
02-11-2018T18:24:46,RimaDraws,getting teary
02-11-2018T18:25:11,HobbitGames,Yeah. Maybe we should
02-11-2018T18:26:02,RimaDraws,im gonna stop there because i don't want to end up crying
02-11-2018T18:26:13,HobbitGames,"Yeah, we wouldnt want that"
02-11-2018T18:26:30,RimaDraws,but yea im the only art freak in the family (good way not bad)
02-11-2018T18:26:38,RimaDraws,my mom brags about my art no matter what it is
02-11-2018T18:27:02,RimaDraws,even if its not my best work she shares it all over facebook for her friends to see
02-11-2018T18:27:13,HobbitGames,"My brother, myself and my mother are all very much into art, although my brother is less so than me and my mother"
02-11-2018T18:27:19,Mippy,My parents use to be pretty good artists but they gave it up before I was born. Too bad
02-11-2018T18:27:31,RimaDraws,i don't know where i got it
02-11-2018T18:27:41,Mippy,My bro can’t draw a stick figure
02-11-2018T18:27:48,HobbitGames,My mam made a few hundred once selling paintings at an exhibition
02-11-2018T18:28:00,RimaDraws,i wish i could lol
02-11-2018T18:28:02,RimaDraws,i can paint
02-11-2018T18:28:05,HobbitGames,Shes really quite good
02-11-2018T18:28:05,RimaDraws,but not that well
02-11-2018T18:28:22,RimaDraws,i only learned from my art professor eric
02-11-2018T18:28:29,HobbitGames,"Hahaha Im not too good at the whole, mixing colours part of it"
02-11-2018T18:28:48,RimaDraws,he helped me learned to sketch it out with charcoal and paint with umbra paint then color it
02-11-2018T18:28:50,Mippy,We could really use an Eric emote right now. XD
02-11-2018T18:28:58,RimaDraws,yea thats actually his name
02-11-2018T18:29:08,RimaDraws,he is one of the best laid back art teachers i could ask for
02-11-2018T18:29:12,Mippy,I have a year long painting class right now
02-11-2018T18:29:13,RimaDraws,i can't brag enough about him
02-11-2018T18:29:39,HobbitGames,"The art teachers ive had were not too unique or special, tbh"
02-11-2018T18:29:59,RimaDraws,yea he's special to me because he is so patient with his students
02-11-2018T18:30:05,Mippy,My art history teacher is also a bodybuilder
02-11-2018T18:30:30,Mippy,His hobbies are art and pumping iron
02-11-2018T18:30:36,qwe304,Id like to think Im a decent artist
02-11-2018T18:30:42,RimaDraws,mine used to be in the military taught in china 8 years then came here
02-11-2018T18:30:48,HobbitGames,"My favourite teacher ive ever had was my junior cert history teacher. I dont know what grades that is in america, and im not bothered to look it up."
02-11-2018T18:31:28,HobbitGames,"He got me so into history. And thanks to him, I can now name probably any country on a map"

02-11-2018T19:21:40,Bgrmystr2,anything* even
02-11-2018T19:21:54,HobbitGames,"Not really, it just explains that little bit"
02-11-2018T19:21:59,RimaDraws,>>
02-11-2018T19:22:10,HobbitGames,American english finds a need tl be different to real english
02-11-2018T19:22:23,Bgrmystr2,"Actually 99% of the pronunciations are the same as british, though the spelling is different sometimes"
02-11-2018T19:22:30,Bgrmystr2,I've studied quite a bit on that
02-11-2018T19:22:36,RimaDraws,thats interesting
02-11-2018T19:22:42,HobbitGames,"Yeah, but it doesnt make sense whybtheu need to be different"
02-11-2018T19:22:49,Bgrmystr2,well we aren't.
02-11-2018T19:22:57,Bgrmystr2,We're not the one that changed.
02-11-2018T19:23:02,RimaDraws,okay
02-11-2018T19:23:11,HobbitGames,You arent the one that changed?
02-11-2018T19:23:15,HobbitGames,How?
02-11-2018T19:23:31,Bgrmystr2,"Yup. It's fact. When Britain came here, we adopted the current way of speaking at the time."
02-11-2018T19:23:45,HobbitGames,The English LITERALLY invented the language and gave it to you
02-11-2018T19:23:47,Bgrmystr2,It is then British English that changed to be more updated
02-11-2018T19:23:51,Bgrmystr2,and we did not
02-11-2018T19:24:04,Bgrmystr2,so yes I will say for a fact that it is not us that changed.
02-11-2018T19:24:20,unsteddyphoenix,"Americans arent really the ""changing"" sort"
02-11-2018T19:24:22,HobbitGames,"There are accounts of people changing the language for ""American patriotism"""
02-11-2018T19:24:25,Bgrmystr2,because we are still here with the same language that was brought here from back then
02-11-2018T19:24:52,HobbitGames,Really???
02-11-2018T19:25:00,HobbitGames,Are you SURE about that?
02-11-2018T19:25:21,Bgrmystr2,"Just as British English evolved, the English we had here in the USA evolved too, but now everyone says that the US changed and that's just not the case at all."
02-11-2018T19:25:26,Bgrmystr2,I'm very sure.
02-11-2018T19:25:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"@unsteddyphoenix I changed out my light bulb just last week, how dare you talk about how we change"
02-11-2018T19:25:38,Bgrmystr2,The languages are different for sure though
02-11-2018T19:25:45,HobbitGames,"Because, if im not mistaken, since the 1800s, English in England hasnt changed much either"
02-11-2018T19:26:10,RimaDraws,lol marv

02-11-2018T19:34:18,Xexanoth,i just love that Webster just went: Fuck Britain and changed a whole bunch of stuff...pretty much the most american thing ever
02-11-2018T19:34:37,Bgrmystr2,"haha, Well I can't speak for dictionaries. They do their own thing"

02-11-2018T19:35:31,HobbitGames,We probably have more cause to hate britain than evrryone else combined
02-11-2018T19:36:17,Bgrmystr2,"Well, the US had massive war and stuff over it.."
02-11-2018T19:36:21,Bgrmystr2,lotta ppl died
02-11-2018T19:36:41,HobbitGames,"Well, that was because of taxes. You know. Something that LITERALLY everyone else had"
02-11-2018T19:36:46,Bgrmystr2,yeah
02-11-2018T19:37:13,HobbitGames,Half our population died becaise the british didnt feed us. Still hasnt recovered
02-11-2018T19:37:35,Bgrmystr2,and then tea was poured into the waters of boston and that wasn't a fun time.. cuz noone insults britain's tea.
02-11-2018T19:37:45,HobbitGames,Hahaha yeah
02-11-2018T19:38:28,Bgrmystr2,"To be fair, the US prolly escalated it further, but we became a big country cuz of it, so there's that"
02-11-2018T19:38:36,Bgrmystr2,I don't hate Britain :v
02-11-2018T19:38:40,Bgrmystr2,so is cool
02-11-2018T19:38:58,HobbitGames,"Yeah. I guess it also kinda, you know. Allowed democracy to become a reall big thing"
02-11-2018T19:39:07,Bgrmystr2,yeah
02-11-2018T19:39:28,HobbitGames,I dont hate britain either. But if I wanted to Inhave very good cause to lol
02-11-2018T19:39:34,Bgrmystr2,I mean personally I'm not a big fan of someone from some far away place having rule over a land that they probably know very little to nothing about
02-11-2018T19:39:57,HobbitGames,Didnt the US have the philipines as a colony?
02-11-2018T19:40:05,Ordithus,Yes
02-11-2018T19:40:13,HobbitGames,*cough cough*
02-11-2018T19:40:28,HobbitGames,And kinda liberia
02-11-2018T19:40:33,Bgrmystr2,they prolly hated us for the same reasons so
02-11-2018T19:40:35,Ordithus,"Taken from Spain, was a colony until after WW2"
02-11-2018T19:40:39,Bgrmystr2,I can't really blame em
02-11-2018T19:40:53,HobbitGames,Yeah.
02-11-2018T19:41:26,Ordithus,Guam is still a US territory
02-11-2018T19:41:29,Ordithus,Very far away
02-11-2018T19:41:35,Bgrmystr2,"nowadays with airplanes and helicopters and stuff you could easily control a huge area and actually visit it, make sure it's not a wasteland and whatnot"
02-11-2018T19:41:39,HobbitGames,So is pierto rico
02-11-2018T19:41:45,Ordithus,Not as far
02-11-2018T19:41:54,HobbitGames,And a binch of pacific islands. Because of bird poop
02-11-2018T19:42:20,Ordithus,AK and HA are way further from the mainland than Puerto Rico

02-11-2018T19:51:48,HobbitGames,That or there were some awesome suggestions
02-11-2018T19:52:00,Bgrmystr2,rather that than just a landslide of 90% votes being one image alone or something
02-11-2018T19:52:02,HobbitGames,unless its a colour vite. In which case I agree with the rest of yiz

02-11-2018T20:01:28,Ordithus,I just don't care for games on a phone
02-11-2018T20:01:44,HobbitGames,The history teacher i was talking about before had or has a phone that has been run over by trucks and has survived
02-11-2018T20:01:53,Bgrmystr2,games on phones are one of those 'just to have' not something you'd really enjoy
02-11-2018T20:02:07,RimaDraws,i like playing them on my phone
02-11-2018T20:02:10,RimaDraws,gives me something to do
02-11-2018T20:02:13,Bgrmystr2,yeah there's some tank phones out there
02-11-2018T20:02:30,Ordithus,Internet browser and navigation are why I go for the smartphone... access to files and things like Word and Excel are nice too
02-11-2018T20:03:04,HobbitGames,I found out i have word on my phone like 2 months ago. I was absolutely buzzing
02-11-2018T20:03:06,Ordithus,They come in very handy when travelling
02-11-2018T20:03:17,Bgrmystr2,I couldn't pay for the internet even if I had a smartphone
02-11-2018T20:03:28,Bgrmystr2,"so honestly, it's pointless in my position"

02-11-2018T20:25:27,Ordithus,How long do you suppose Evals has been a slave? 7 or 8 years? :ptv-wondering:
02-11-2018T20:25:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,5 days
02-11-2018T20:26:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,he was mostly faking to get close to mike
02-11-2018T20:26:27,Ordithus,":ctwokinds-sadtrace2: ""you're mine now, doggo"""
02-11-2018T20:27:22,Ordithus,"I'm just wondering if he'd have a ""home"" to really return to"
02-11-2018T20:34:08,RimaDraws,he's been a slave since childhood
02-11-2018T20:34:14,RimaDraws,if i recall right
02-11-2018T20:34:22,RimaDraws,mike was born into slavery
02-11-2018T20:35:37,CrRAR,indeed
02-11-2018T20:35:40,RimaDraws,they kinda grew up together i mean. still i can understand why ev wants out and to leave
02-11-2018T20:35:49,RimaDraws,but does he really have family to go back to? probs not
02-11-2018T20:35:52,Ordithus,relevant http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/617/
02-11-2018T20:36:26,Ordithus,He might.  Depends on the circumstances of him becoming a slave in the first place
02-11-2018T20:36:55,RimaDraws,i mean he might but we don't know if they are gone
02-11-2018T20:37:06,RimaDraws,but how ev just dismissed how mike feels its kinda bull
02-11-2018T20:37:29,Ordithus,"Well, he did say then that Mike could come with him, but yeah"
02-11-2018T20:37:50,RimaDraws,yea but he's being totally dismissive
02-11-2018T20:38:06,Ordithus,True.  He's quite focused on his own dream
02-11-2018T20:38:30,RimaDraws,yea and honestly mike feels a bit hurt but then again the mistake of being a female was because of nora.
02-11-2018T20:38:46,RimaDraws,its neither of their fault but yet mike seems to wire one way while ev the other
02-11-2018T20:38:56,Ordithus,His brief stint as a girl doesn't really have anything to do with it
02-11-2018T20:39:08,RimaDraws,well some fans think it does but i digress
02-11-2018T20:39:21,Ordithus,"""Awaken the true love""?"
02-11-2018T20:39:22,RimaDraws,i mean mike may feel something for ev but ev don't feel that way
02-11-2018T20:39:26,RimaDraws,know what im saying?
02-11-2018T20:39:35,RimaDraws,ev dont swing that way
02-11-2018T20:39:59,Ordithus,"Mike: ""I don't know how to say this, but I love you, Evs.""  Evals: ""Oh, I've known for a while now"" Flora: ""pretty obv:"

02-11-2018T20:40:12,RimaDraws,yea very obvious
02-11-2018T20:40:37,RimaDraws,but with how mike said a lot of us might not be together anymore bugs me a bit
02-11-2018T20:40:49,Ordithus,yeah
02-11-2018T20:40:55,CrRAR,"I mean, being good friends is a tough bond to break."
02-11-2018T20:41:00,Ordithus,There's more to what he's saying than just the words
02-11-2018T20:41:14,RimaDraws,there is i mean it could be foreshadowing a death or two
02-11-2018T20:41:40,RimaDraws,or characters going off screen
02-11-2018T20:41:49,RimaDraws,but i think the first is the issue
02-11-2018T20:41:54,CrRAR,xpx
02-11-2018T20:42:34,Bgrmystr2,"death probably not, moreso just splitting the characters and not seeing that character anymore in the story."
02-11-2018T20:42:46,RimaDraws,yea thats gonna suck
02-11-2018T20:42:51,RimaDraws,because i like mike and ev
02-11-2018T20:42:54,Ordithus,It's gonna be a sad moment
02-11-2018T20:42:57,Bgrmystr2,that's what happens to side characters
02-11-2018T20:43:03,Bgrmystr2,they're just that.
02-11-2018T20:43:05,SpazztasticKiwi,“We can penpal”
02-11-2018T20:43:06,RimaDraws,yea because honestly i was close to crying reading that page
02-11-2018T20:43:25,RimaDraws,thats part of the reason i was emotional earlier
02-11-2018T20:44:21,Ordithus,"Bittersweet, I hope.  Hopefully theirs is a happy ending, if that's where it goes."
02-11-2018T20:44:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Surely Tom’s not murderous
02-11-2018T20:44:48,RimaDraws,i hope its not character death because goodbyes are bad enough

02-11-2018T22:52:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Pancake boobs can be great
02-11-2018T22:52:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,boob'd shaped pancakes
02-11-2018T22:52:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"With whipped cream, there can be a bit of breakfast served in bed"
02-11-2018T22:53:02,Mippy,:ctwokinds-floraquestion: with chocolate chips?
02-11-2018T22:54:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I once watched a comedian that asked the audience what foods they used in bed
02-11-2018T22:54:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Bunch of desserts
02-11-2018T22:54:40,SpazztasticKiwi,But for some reason we got bacon flavored condoms
02-11-2018T22:55:10,FennexTheFox,hey guys!
02-11-2018T22:55:19,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-reniembarrassed:
02-11-2018T22:55:21,Mippy,Bacon flavoured things never taste like bacon. So disappoint
02-11-2018T22:55:22,Ordithus,Hi Fen
02-11-2018T22:55:31,Mippy,Hey Fox
02-11-2018T22:56:20,FennexTheFox,im annoyed rn
02-11-2018T22:56:35,Mippy,Ohkawa
02-11-2018T22:56:59,Mippy,(Autocorrect)
02-11-2018T22:57:05,FennexTheFox,so i looked up yosh bc i wanted a rundown on the story since its so long... and one of the first few links was a badwebcomicswiki link :(
02-11-2018T22:57:55,Mippy,:ctwokinds-keifacepalm: It’s like the reviews were written by people who never read the comics
02-11-2018T22:58:02,FennexTheFox,"i mean.. that site is how i found twokinds, and realized that site was full of shit"
02-11-2018T22:58:05,FennexTheFox,but jesus
02-11-2018T22:58:19,FennexTheFox,the reviewer said some pretty awful things about sage
02-11-2018T22:58:27,FennexTheFox,and it just pissed me off
02-11-2018T22:58:57,Mippy,Same Fox. I’m just glad I have a healthy dose of scepticism and took a look for myself.
02-11-2018T23:00:41,FennexTheFox,"its like they went in saying ""this comic sucks, lemme prove it sucks"" and never looked at it from a positive standpoint"
02-11-2018T23:01:51,SpazztasticKiwi,People like to do that with successful people
02-11-2018T23:02:29,FennexTheFox,also lots of reviews seem to call it pedophilic for some reason
02-11-2018T23:02:36,FennexTheFox,like.. what
02-11-2018T23:02:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"With Mark and other YouTubers, it’s “your fans are nothing but 12 year old girls”"
02-11-2018T23:02:53,SpazztasticKiwi,They bitter
02-11-2018T23:03:06,Mippy,???? Aren’t they all college age or something?
02-11-2018T23:03:31,Mippy,(I’m not that far into Yosh! Yet)
02-11-2018T23:03:44,Ordithus,They are indeed
02-11-2018T23:03:44,FennexTheFox,"Oh, they call Twokinds pedophilic"
02-11-2018T23:04:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Makes me wonder about those who worry themselves over the sex lives or lives in general of others
02-11-2018T23:04:23,FennexTheFox,boy howdy i do sure hate people who have lives
02-11-2018T23:04:27,Mippy,:ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot: we all adults here
02-11-2018T23:05:12,Mippy,Except Madie...but she has never been sexualized
02-11-2018T23:05:41,FennexTheFox,We don't know Maddie's age
02-11-2018T23:05:44,SpazztasticKiwi,“I don’t like that thing they’re passionate about. That must mean they’ll never find someone who’s passionate about it. Mwahaha they will remain single forever and I shall tell them so”
02-11-2018T23:06:03,FennexTheFox,checkmate atheists
02-11-2018T23:07:33,Mippy,"Anyway, I haven’t been on that Wiki in years. It’s total BS...well...it was right about Sonichu...I’ll give it that say least."
02-11-2018T23:07:49,FennexTheFox,That'
02-11-2018T23:07:58,FennexTheFox,That's all it can get credit for lol*
02-11-2018T23:08:13,SpazztasticKiwi,The only truly disturbing web comic I’ve come across is Killing Stalking
02-11-2018T23:08:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I tell you all
02-11-2018T23:08:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t care how old you are
02-11-2018T23:08:31,Mippy,Sent me into the rabbit hole that is Chris Chan
02-11-2018T23:08:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Or what you’ve seen
02-11-2018T23:08:42,SpazztasticKiwi,DO NOT SEEK THAT COMIC OUT
02-11-2018T23:08:58,Mippy,Now you’ve got me curious Kiwi.
02-11-2018T23:09:03,FennexTheFox,Same
02-11-2018T23:09:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Torture
02-11-2018T23:09:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Stockholm syndrome
02-11-2018T23:09:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Rape
02-11-2018T23:09:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Murder
02-11-2018T23:09:44,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s what it has
02-11-2018T23:10:01,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s not pretty and I wonder if it’s even fully legal
02-11-2018T23:10:05,Mippy,Ooooo...all the good stuff.
02-11-2018T23:10:30,Dadrobit,Back for a hot second.
02-11-2018T23:10:39,Mippy,Hey Dad
02-11-2018T23:10:50,Dadrobit,Talking about crazy webcomics? Try Jack.
02-11-2018T23:12:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m all about my freaky bedroom stuff reading but I got a line
02-11-2018T23:12:44,Mippy,Actually Kiwi...I might be kind of into reading a bit of that...out of curiosity
02-11-2018T23:13:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I just seriously didn’t like it
02-11-2018T23:13:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, it’s gay - like the torturer and the torturee are both men"
02-11-2018T23:14:20,Mippy,"Ohhh...Dad, I remember seeing that one on the Badwebcomic wiki years ago."
02-11-2018T23:14:22,SpazztasticKiwi,And said torturer takes complete manipulative control of the other
02-11-2018T23:14:43,FennexTheFox,just looked up jack
02-11-2018T23:14:45,FennexTheFox,what the fuck
02-11-2018T23:15:29,Mippy,....I have absolutely no problem with gay...I like gay...I’m a Alaric/Keith shipped :ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:
02-11-2018T23:15:44,Mippy,*er
02-11-2018T23:16:15,Mippy,Give me all the gay
02-11-2018T23:16:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t care if something is yaoi either. Used to watch Junjou Romantica and Sekai-Ichi Hatsukoi
02-11-2018T23:16:45,FennexTheFox,I'm the one that does all the gay requests on sundays
02-11-2018T23:16:58,FennexTheFox,but just because its gay doesnt make it immune to being bad
02-11-2018T23:17:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you want something to fulfill your yaoi yearning heart, JR & SIH will do it"
02-11-2018T23:17:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"Plus, the stories/animes intertwine"
02-11-2018T23:17:42,Mippy,"Been there, done that Kiwi."
02-11-2018T23:18:33,FennexTheFox,"Nah, I'm more of a yuri fan. Which is pretty annoying at times.. since I'm a girl that likes girls, and all of the sexualization without story is kinda annoying"
02-11-2018T23:18:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Yukina x Kisa
02-11-2018T23:19:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Those two were my favorite
02-11-2018T23:19:16,Mippy,I need to get one of my Alaric/ Keith shippy sketches through sometime
02-11-2018T23:19:52,FennexTheFox,I'm on the Raine x Maren bandwagon
02-11-2018T23:19:54,SpazztasticKiwi,You did see that JR got a third season rigt
02-11-2018T23:19:56,Mippy,Hmmm...I need to do more yuri.
02-11-2018T23:20:30,Mippy,I ship it Fox. :ctwokinds-rainehappy:+:ctwokinds-eyeroll:
02-11-2018T23:20:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t know why I love it all so much. Probably because of the romance
02-11-2018T23:20:42,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
02-11-2018T23:20:54,SpazztasticKiwi,So cute you wanna squeeze them
02-11-2018T23:21:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Nite Ord
02-11-2018T23:21:05,Ordithus,Lies
02-11-2018T23:21:10,Mippy,"Yeah, I just haven’t had a chance to get to it Kiwi"
02-11-2018T23:21:27,SpazztasticKiwi,You’re in for a treat
02-11-2018T23:21:28,FennexTheFox,It's the cuteness
02-11-2018T23:21:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I haven’t seen either of them in awhile
02-11-2018T23:21:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"Used to have all episodes, OVAs, and movies downloaded"
02-11-2018T23:21:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Of both animes
02-11-2018T23:22:14,SpazztasticKiwi,And all seasons
02-11-2018T23:22:35,Mippy,I use to read the manga before Tokyopop shut down the first time. I
02-11-2018T23:23:13,SpazztasticKiwi,The episodes used to be on YT
02-11-2018T23:23:20,Mippy,Any yuri recriminations Fox?
02-11-2018T23:23:44,FennexTheFox,Unfortunately I haven't found any good ones really ;-;
02-11-2018T23:24:09,Mippy,:ctwokinds-LauraCry: No! I need some good girl stuff
02-11-2018T23:24:14,FennexTheFox,same
02-11-2018T23:24:29,Mippy,The hunt continues
02-11-2018T23:25:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Wonder if Tom knows any
02-11-2018T23:25:47,SpazztasticKiwi,or just regular animes
02-11-2018T23:26:02,Mippy,Tom do yuri?
02-11-2018T23:26:29,Mippy,I’ll take regular recramendations too
02-11-2018T23:27:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I dunno if he does or not
02-11-2018T23:28:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"But he’s free to have the interest and if he do, I wanna know if he’s seen a good one I haven’t"
02-11-2018T23:30:01,Mippy,Ugh! It’s cold and wet out. No wonder I have a cold.
02-11-2018T23:30:46,Mippy,So...who else has watched a bit of hentai out of curiosity?
02-11-2018T23:31:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve come across it by accident and via porn bots on tumblr
02-11-2018T23:32:07,SpazztasticKiwi,And I remember I googled it to find the definition
02-11-2018T23:32:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Without safe search
02-11-2018T23:32:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Bad idea
02-11-2018T23:32:52,Mippy,Watched a episode of Night Shift Nurses last night....
02-11-2018T23:33:02,GhostPack24,I'M BACK!
02-11-2018T23:33:33,Mippy,Oh...it’s “fun with ghost” time
02-11-2018T23:34:14,Bgrmystr2,"lol mippy, you prolly don't want to run through my memory of things I've watched/read"
02-11-2018T23:35:21,Mippy,XD Oh Bgr! We all know you’ve seen things we ought not to ask about
02-11-2018T23:36:02,GhostPack24,Do you guys like my picture l?
02-11-2018T23:36:14,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-snicker: Yes, Mippy. Yes I have."
02-11-2018T23:36:16,GhostPack24,*Picture*
02-11-2018T23:36:53,Bgrmystr2,"I can't even see most pictures on here, they're too small to make out"
02-11-2018T23:37:06,Mippy,Oooooo.... hentai Bgr! :ptv-ohmy:
02-11-2018T23:37:16,SpazztasticKiwi,We don’t look at the pictures unless they’re on the stream
02-11-2018T23:37:45,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. yeah mippy I just said so earlier xD
02-11-2018T23:38:14,GhostPack24,:p
02-11-2018T23:38:14,Bgrmystr2,opening with that wasn't enough of a hint? haha
02-11-2018T23:38:22,Mippy,:ptv-laugh:
02-11-2018T23:38:50,Mippy,"Naw, we on the same page mate"
02-11-2018T23:40:12,Bgrmystr2,"There's a reason I can watch fluff's stream weekly and just *""..Meh. same ol""* :ptv-uneasy:"
02-11-2018T23:41:28,Mippy,I should look up some of Fluff’a stuff...never seen it.
02-11-2018T23:41:39,Bgrmystr2,it's good
02-11-2018T23:41:39,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-MikeLewd:
02-11-2018T23:41:54,Bgrmystr2,"he's a good artist. vibrant colors, nice detail"
02-11-2018T23:42:13,Bgrmystr2,"lacks speed in his process, but otherwise solid work"
02-11-2018T23:42:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Fluff’s good
02-11-2018T23:43:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I have one thing about it but it’s just about his anatomy style
02-11-2018T23:43:33,Bgrmystr2,yeah sometimes I see images where it's not great
02-11-2018T23:44:02,Mippy,I like this https://www.deviantart.com/fur-kevlar/art/Enticing-Horizons-297501912
02-11-2018T23:44:36,SpazztasticKiwi,She’s nice
02-11-2018T23:44:41,Bgrmystr2,yeah Mippy same. Tis why I nabbed the biggest one I could and framed it on my wall. :)
02-11-2018T23:44:53,Bgrmystr2,of that image particular
02-11-2018T23:45:23,SpazztasticKiwi,His attention to correct anatomical drawing is good
02-11-2018T23:45:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Thankfully
02-11-2018T23:45:31,Bgrmystr2,one of my absolute favorites
02-11-2018T23:46:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Can’t completely criticize the male style but he does like one female style
02-11-2018T23:46:29,Bgrmystr2,though I don't think I can really give anyone shit for giving me the furry card when they see it
02-11-2018T23:47:02,SpazztasticKiwi,But the anamatronic girl is so precious
02-11-2018T23:47:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I totally didn’t forget her name
02-11-2018T23:47:31,SpazztasticKiwi,*cough*

02-11-2018T23:50:14,Mippy,I have to go switch my clock.
02-11-2018T23:51:17,Dadrobit,You literally can.
02-11-2018T23:51:33,Dadrobit,Close the tab and learn to whistle a new tune.
02-11-2018T23:51:36,Mippy,"Ok, done! Daylight savings will not get the better of me. :csagesaga-c3:"
02-11-2018T23:51:52,Dadrobit,So thankful that I don't deal with DST messes.
02-11-2018T23:51:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Dadro rises from the depths to call out some bs
02-11-2018T23:52:07,Dadrobit,"""I live again"""
02-11-2018T23:52:08,Ordithus,"Oh, but you still do, robit"
02-11-2018T23:52:25,Ordithus,"Not as much, I'll grant you"
02-11-2018T23:52:28,Dadrobit,"I only have to listen to other people complain about it, that's all."
02-11-2018T23:52:39,Dadrobit,AZ does not observe DST.
02-11-2018T23:52:48,Ordithus,"Ah, but the stream times change for you"
02-11-2018T23:52:57,Dadrobit,Literally because we are against having to deal with the sun any more than we have to.
02-11-2018T23:53:00,GhostPack24,I am listining to some music right now
02-11-2018T23:53:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Ooo I wonder if Tom remembered
02-11-2018T23:53:25,Dadrobit,"Ord. Clearly you do not know my schedule, lest you recall that I never make it to streams anyways lol."
02-11-2018T23:53:31,Ordithus,haha
02-11-2018T23:53:38,Ordithus,too true
02-11-2018T23:54:17,Dadrobit,"And yeah, I went for a bit to look at Jack again. It was updated for a while, but seems to be on hiatus again."
02-11-2018T23:54:22,GhostPack24,It is XP OOf
02-11-2018T23:54:57,Mippy,I have no idea what that is Ghost
02-11-2018T23:54:59,GhostPack24,Not oof as in a song i was shot
02-11-2018T23:55:15,Ordithus,Then you should go to the hospital
02-11-2018T23:55:15,Dadrobit,No roleplaying in chat.
02-11-2018T23:55:34,Bgrmystr2,"We tried that twice earlier, dadro"
02-11-2018T23:55:42,SpazztasticKiwi,“Says self-proclaimed ‘dad’”
02-11-2018T23:55:54,SpazztasticKiwi,He has no listening ears
02-11-2018T23:56:10,Dadrobit,"People call me daddy, but it's not like I do anything with that."
02-11-2018T23:56:15,Dadrobit,In this chat
