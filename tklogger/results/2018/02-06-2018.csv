02-06-2018T00:29:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve started jotting down short ideas for sketches and it‚Äôs occurred to me that I have very tiny handwriting
02-06-2018T02:14:44,JamesBSquirrel3,"12 hours to go of results of TK Color Sketches, (and Good Morning!)"
02-06-2018T06:15:19,JamesBSquirrel3,less 9 hours to go voting results!:ptv-condescending:
02-06-2018T06:17:36,JamesBSquirrel3,I shouldn't put to webcomic into 15 Year Production from 14 in a row.
02-06-2018T06:49:42,JamesBSquirrel3,"Soon when it livestream are on, I'll properly btw more than 6 or monivated 7 hours rated, whatever that is he'll doing anyways."
02-06-2018T09:11:28,JamesBSquirrel3,6 hrs countdown now!
02-06-2018T11:32:09,JamesBSquirrel3,more than 3 hours now!
02-06-2018T12:32:49,SpazztasticKiwi,:ctwokinds-katdryer:
02-06-2018T12:35:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Her nose is in the center- it‚Äôs like she‚Äôs spinning on her nose

02-06-2018T12:38:42,Xexanoth,"lol, i just watched the slow mo guys destroy records by spinning em to fast and then i come here to more spinning."
02-06-2018T12:38:51,Xexanoth,*spin all the things*
02-06-2018T12:53:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Join the spin. We‚Äôre making ice cream :ctwokinds-katdryer:
02-06-2018T12:54:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm debating a nap but the stream‚Äôs close
02-06-2018T13:08:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, how‚Äôs Atlanta Tom?"
02-06-2018T13:24:48,Twokinds,I was disappointed. It wasn't a lost underwater civilization like I was lead to believe.
02-06-2018T13:26:27,Xexanoth,No hot mermaids for you!
02-06-2018T13:29:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Can confirm. Atlanta is not Atlantis.
02-06-2018T13:29:46,SpazztasticKiwi,But it‚Äôs humid enough to be underwater
02-06-2018T13:30:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you want to go to another world, though I suggest a less centralized city of the south"
02-06-2018T13:32:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a feeling tom would be immune to the hot mermaids
02-06-2018T13:34:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre trying to drown me and all, but I need to finish this sketch‚Äù"
02-06-2018T13:43:22,PalmettoPathfinder1,I'm hoping the crown of flowers gets picked.
02-06-2018T13:50:33,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:
02-06-2018T13:50:51,Mippy,I thought we had some cream cheese in the fridge...turns out it was garlic butter
02-06-2018T13:50:56,Xexanoth,"me too, but man, lots of good basitins pics to choose from this time(well mostly Keith pics ^^)"
02-06-2018T13:51:18,CrRAR,Damn future and your gratuitous condiments!
02-06-2018T13:51:23,CrRAR,*shakes fist*
02-06-2018T13:53:52,JamesBSquirrel3,"Well I don't what's going, but I don't even bother some point, though. Anyways, more than 1 hour to go before this goes... Be Prepare!:ptv-right:"
02-06-2018T13:54:10,CrRAR,Feeling good over here. I finished all my car maintenance with time to spare.
02-06-2018T13:54:27,CrRAR,Yeah I wonder if there were lots of close vote counts this week.
02-06-2018T13:55:01,CrRAR,Very tough choosing.
02-06-2018T13:56:31,JamesBSquirrel3,Well we don't know it end up began and wait and see
02-06-2018T13:57:42,CrRAR,mmhmm
02-06-2018T14:01:02,Mippy,"I can't remember what I voted for. I'll be happy either way, lots of good choices this time round."
02-06-2018T14:04:41,PalmettoPathfinder1,I also picked Adira posing and the Mean Girls pics.  It was tough actually.  There were just so many great pics to choose from!
02-06-2018T14:05:40,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Also, tell me true or false: Michael Bay is the greatest movie director in the universe, second only to Peter Jackson, Stephen Spielberg, and George Lucas."
02-06-2018T14:12:08,JamesBSquirrel3,Good Question @PalmettoPathfinder1.
02-06-2018T14:19:43,PalmettoPathfinder1,Yep.
02-06-2018T14:21:27,JamesBSquirrel3,I have recevie on Google websites have found in any but I cannot sure the answer to. So I just continue searching to seek in.
02-06-2018T14:22:40,Bgrmystr2,"James, you're either doing this on purpose, or the English language does not work the way you think it does."
02-06-2018T14:23:45,Mippy,Is James useing Google Translate?
02-06-2018T14:24:15,Mippy,Or an ESL studeent? Possibly?
02-06-2018T14:24:42,Bgrmystr2,He's likely doing this on purpose if he lives in the UK
02-06-2018T14:25:18,Mippy,Hmmmm :ptv-wondering:
02-06-2018T14:29:31,Xexanoth,or he just moved to the uk?
02-06-2018T14:30:00,Bgrmystr2,iunno.
02-06-2018T14:30:33,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, there's talk of a crossover between GI Joe, Transformers, and Jem & the Holograms.  0.o  Yeah, weird."
02-06-2018T14:31:56,Mippy,^ Those movies ae all bad...though I admit Bayformers is a guilty pleasure of mine
02-06-2018T14:32:28,PalmettoPathfinder1,Yes!  A fellow fan of Michael Bay!
02-06-2018T14:32:54,Bgrmystr2,the only thing good about those are the explosions and stuff.
02-06-2018T14:33:00,Bgrmystr2,it's over the top
02-06-2018T14:33:09,Bgrmystr2,he does over the top explosion-y stuff really well.
02-06-2018T14:33:16,Bgrmystr2,stuff that wouldn't make sense irl
02-06-2018T14:33:22,Bgrmystr2,everything else... ehhhh
02-06-2018T14:33:36,JamesBSquirrel3,"@PalmettoPathfinder1. I found any if I could but I hate to say a guess is unfortunately FALSE, because sometimes was good but sometimes the critical respone of audience are not good enough, y'see."
02-06-2018T14:33:48,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Indeed.  Of course, the Transformers movies could have been done by Uwe."
02-06-2018T14:34:48,PalmettoPathfinder1,Bay did do a great job on the Pearl Harbor movie.
02-06-2018T14:34:57,JamesBSquirrel3,"Yeap, things never change in history."
02-06-2018T14:35:01,Xexanoth,he did great movies before he started transformers
02-06-2018T14:35:23,SpazztasticKiwi,That English style is giving me a headache
02-06-2018T14:35:49,PalmettoPathfinder1,Just wished he had given more screen time for Grimlock in the Last Knight movie.
02-06-2018T14:36:01,Mippy,Confession: I have never watched Pearl Harbor
02-06-2018T14:36:56,Mippy,I work with a bunch of ESL people...so I'm use to strange English Kiwi
02-06-2018T14:38:54,Bgrmystr2,yeah but most of his previous statements were not even remotely ESL level
02-06-2018T14:39:01,Bgrmystr2,they were purposely intelligable
02-06-2018T14:39:10,Bgrmystr2,not even children are that bad
02-06-2018T14:39:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I kinda read it with an accent. I‚Äôm used to accents
02-06-2018T14:39:26,Bgrmystr2,xD
02-06-2018T14:40:13,TerraTheWizard,helloooooo~

02-06-2018T14:42:11,PalmettoPathfinder1,They're going to do a prequel movie starting Bumblebee.  Michael Bay is the producer.
02-06-2018T14:42:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Ello o/
02-06-2018T14:42:28,TerraTheWizard,"picarto pls, a video streaming site shouldn't have this much whitespace around the player"
02-06-2018T14:42:28,Bgrmystr2,hey marv
02-06-2018T14:42:42,Bgrmystr2,yeah picarto did that cuz they're dumb Terra
02-06-2018T14:42:50,JamesBSquirrel3,"Anyway Michael Bay the Director, I hope he makes sure never happen soft."
02-06-2018T14:43:03,Bgrmystr2,ahh there we go
02-06-2018T14:43:10,Bgrmystr2,back to normal jibberish
02-06-2018T14:43:16,Bgrmystr2,feels better
02-06-2018T14:43:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Picarto does what it wants. Regardless if it makes sense or is practical
02-06-2018T14:43:59,JamesBSquirrel3,But let's concertrate to Livestream results more than 15 mintues left.
02-06-2018T14:44:19,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, my local library has blocked Picarto."
02-06-2018T14:44:36,Mippy,Ok....that is Google translate bad. I could figure out what James ment in the other posts I've seen but that takes the cake
02-06-2018T14:45:00,Bgrmystr2,"oh there's been way worse, mippy"
02-06-2018T14:45:03,JamesBSquirrel3,"Oh your unlucky, is there other way?"
02-06-2018T14:45:03,Bgrmystr2,wayyy worse xD
02-06-2018T14:45:27,Mippy,I'll take your word for it Bgr
02-06-2018T14:45:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Nibs will make it better :ctwokinds-nibsbounce:

02-06-2018T14:46:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom tweeted The Boop

02-06-2018T14:47:03,Mippy,Da Faq
02-06-2018T14:47:38,PalmettoPathfinder1,I had an idea for a new request: Trace learns why you shouldn't blow bubble gum around Keidrans and Basitins.
02-06-2018T14:47:50,SpazztasticKiwi,All up in the fur
02-06-2018T14:48:29,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Yep: He gets many angry glares from Flora, Keith, and Natani."
02-06-2018T14:48:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"And in the next scene, Trace sprinting away with gum-coated Keidrans and Basitins in hot pursuit"
02-06-2018T14:49:21,PalmettoPathfinder1,Indeed!
02-06-2018T14:49:44,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to‚Äù
02-06-2018T14:49:57,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not gonna get it out of my fur!‚Äù
02-06-2018T14:50:32,JamesBSquirrel3,Ah! Which picture a new icon (like emoji + others) like suits you?
02-06-2018T14:52:07,PalmettoPathfinder1,"@SpazztasticKiwi then we see Flora, Keith, and Natani having their fur shaved off and Trace has his hair shaved off, which Trace says, ""Hey this isn't bad being bald.""  And then he looks and sees the angry glares again."
02-06-2018T14:52:15,TerraTheWizard,then we have that scene like in the simpsons where they try all the things that are supposed to get gum out
02-06-2018T14:52:32,PalmettoPathfinder1,lol!  Oh that is a good one Terra!

02-06-2018T15:07:14,TerraTheWizard,well it started off as a twist on the simpsons

02-06-2018T15:08:47,TorqueEmUp,Futurama was good all the way through.
02-06-2018T15:08:53,TorqueEmUp,Well
02-06-2018T15:09:04,TerraTheWizard,futurama dropped quality a little on the last couple of seasons

02-06-2018T19:23:34,ZRO4825,"I'm going to be perfectly blunt. It's one thing if it's directed AT her. If it's not directed AT her? Then with all due respect, if she's THAT upset by a bit of bantering back and forth, then she should perhaps stay away from anything chat related"
02-06-2018T19:23:37,ZRO4825,until she has calmed down.

02-06-2018T19:26:02,PalmettoPathfinder1,I'm betting Puppy Nat is not paper trained.
02-06-2018T19:26:05,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Oooohhh
02-06-2018T19:26:08,Bgrmystr2,Nora shapeshifted into Reni shapeshifted into a small natani

02-06-2018T19:26:55,PalmettoPathfinder1,Didn't say it wasn't Keith's job.  I would probably send Puppy Nat to obedience school first.
02-06-2018T19:27:26,ItsActuallyKopyKat,I said it was keith's job...that's like that standard responsibility of a kid who adopts a puppy
02-06-2018T19:27:29,ThingsAreMoving,&gt;Nat &gt;obedience (pick one)
02-06-2018T19:27:32,ItsActuallyKopyKat,lol

02-06-2018T19:27:53,ThingsAreMoving,u wot m8
02-06-2018T19:27:55,Dadrobit,Don't need obediance school in this world. They have special collars for that :D

02-06-2018T19:28:10,ItsActuallyKopyKat,kinky
02-06-2018T19:28:13,FenceEqualizer,O_o
02-06-2018T19:28:14,MuonNeutrino,"no, slave collars =/"
02-06-2018T19:28:21,ZRO4825,"Dad, that was terrible, lol"

02-06-2018T19:28:56,ItsActuallyKopyKat,I completely forgot about the mind control collars
02-06-2018T19:28:58,ThingsAreMoving,dark af
02-06-2018T19:28:58,unsteddyphoenix,That would just be cruel
02-06-2018T19:29:02,FenceEqualizer,Fantasy PETA is going to get you
02-06-2018T19:29:07,MuonNeutrino,horrible mind control free-will-sellfhood-destroying collars =/
02-06-2018T19:29:15,unsteddyphoenix,never forget
02-06-2018T19:29:23,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Fantasy peta and the real peta can all go and get bent in my opinion
02-06-2018T19:29:31,unsteddyphoenix,I wonder if keidran slavers use those collars?
02-06-2018T19:29:41,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe human slavers sold them to keidran slavers
02-06-2018T19:29:51,Dadrobit,Why wouldn't they?
02-06-2018T19:29:52,MuonNeutrino,@unsteddyphoenix only reason i can think they wouldn't would be is if only the templar manufacture em
02-06-2018T19:29:56,Combak,How about the SPCA?
02-06-2018T19:29:59,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"sure teddy, why not"
02-06-2018T19:30:01,FenceEqualizer,Probably only on the strong willed
02-06-2018T19:30:16,PalmettoPathfinder1,Fantasy PETA is another name for Druids.
02-06-2018T19:30:20,Combak,... Would the world of TK have the SPCK?
02-06-2018T19:30:22,unsteddyphoenix,Idk. Giving magic tech to keidran could be illegal or something.
02-06-2018T19:30:23,MviluUatusun,Puppy Nat looks like she wants to show Maddy a thing or two.
02-06-2018T19:30:24,FenceEqualizer,Unless it's cheap to make do you really want to spend that much money?
02-06-2018T19:30:31,ItsActuallyKopyKat,spca is fine...
02-06-2018T19:30:34,MuonNeutrino,@FenceEqualizer depends - slaves are valuable
02-06-2018T19:30:44,PalmettoPathfinder1,KopyKat there are also radical druids.
02-06-2018T19:30:49,MuonNeutrino,"if it keeps one from escaping, unless they're REALLY expensive it'd be worth it"
02-06-2018T19:31:00,ItsActuallyKopyKat,hmmm true
02-06-2018T19:31:00,MuonNeutrino,at least from a strict economic standpoint
02-06-2018T19:31:05,ThingsAreMoving,Muon that's false
02-06-2018T19:31:13,ItsActuallyKopyKat,@palm
02-06-2018T19:31:14,MuonNeutrino,not to mention that slaves that literally can't disobey orders will get more work done
02-06-2018T19:31:16,ThingsAreMoving,Clovis sold his parents for literally 1 dollar
02-06-2018T19:31:19,Khalandar,si they have paw pats on the front instead of fingers when they are little?
02-06-2018T19:31:19,Dadrobit,"They also last longer than the user, so they're probably recyclable."
02-06-2018T19:31:22,ThingsAreMoving,not valuable
02-06-2018T19:31:26,MuonNeutrino,@ThingsAreMoving that's obviously a joke =P
02-06-2018T19:31:28,Combak,That was a joke Things.

02-06-2018T19:31:59,MuonNeutrino,@Khalandar tom's said that keidran have pads on their hands as well as feet but he just doesn't draw them most of the time
02-06-2018T19:32:05,unsteddyphoenix,100% canon
02-06-2018T19:32:07,MuonNeutrino,iirc he only draws them on raine normally
02-06-2018T19:32:11,ThingsAreMoving,teddy understands
02-06-2018T19:32:11,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"oh, my bad"

02-06-2018T21:22:06,FenceEqualizer,There's so much I have to learn
02-06-2018T21:22:25,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Stick with me, kid, and i'll teach you everything"

02-06-2018T21:23:52,Dadrobit,Convulsing
02-06-2018T21:23:55,Bgrmystr2,"nuh that's a different genre, fence"
02-06-2018T21:23:57,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"If we put all these dead people in individual turbines, then we could solve any power crisis ever"
02-06-2018T21:24:10,Dadrobit,Bon Jovi is not dead tho
02-06-2018T21:24:23,ItsActuallyKopyKat,but all the other dead people
02-06-2018T21:24:55,ItsActuallyKopyKat,?
02-06-2018T21:26:28,unsteddyphoenix,Can you volunteer for turbines
02-06-2018T21:26:33,unsteddyphoenix,Like you can be an organ donor
02-06-2018T21:26:39,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"sure, why not"
02-06-2018T21:26:42,unsteddyphoenix,Sick im in
02-06-2018T21:26:52,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"I'll build you a specialized turbine, teddy"
02-06-2018T21:26:57,ItsActuallyKopyKat,with room for an extra person
02-06-2018T21:29:16,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Alrighty then, I gotta go for real this time...time to cook!"
02-06-2018T21:29:19,Dadrobit,"Cool, you could probably fit at least a dozen cats in all that extra space!"
02-06-2018T21:29:25,ItsActuallyKopyKat,See you all on friday~~
02-06-2018T21:29:29,Dadrobit,o/

02-06-2018T21:29:49,SpazztasticKiwi,üëãüèª
02-06-2018T21:30:07,FenceEqualizer,I'm sure we could just get most of the classical muscians to power most of the world. Sure I could find some Dubstep version of Mozart work somethere.
02-06-2018T21:32:29,Dadrobit,Anywhere is called YouTube circa 2012.
02-06-2018T21:33:30,unsteddyphoenix,byebye~
02-06-2018T21:33:42,unsteddyphoenix,aw she left rip
02-06-2018T21:38:01,FenceEqualizer,"Huh, not sure if intentional but looking up anywhere 2012 actually found me a nice album track"
02-06-2018T21:38:49,Dadrobit,"Lol, unintentional, but I figured that was roughly the era when everyone, their mother, and the kitchen sink was trying to ride the Skrillex wave."
02-06-2018T21:40:05,Dadrobit,"Man, Narcissistic Cannibal came out in '11? I thought it was way more recent than that..."
02-06-2018T21:40:13,unsteddyphoenix,"it really was, i remember that"
02-06-2018T21:40:20,Twokinds,"Holly still wakes up meowing for attention looking for me. I've been back almost a week, cat!"
02-06-2018T21:40:48,FenceEqualizer,She misses her friend!
02-06-2018T21:40:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Awww
02-06-2018T21:40:59,SageSaga,silly cat
02-06-2018T21:41:01,FenceEqualizer,Which...I am still skeptical about.
02-06-2018T21:41:08,unsteddyphoenix,Dont be mean to cat
02-06-2018T21:41:11,Dadrobit,I remember a lot of hype and discontent when it was released.
02-06-2018T21:41:15,Twokinds,Hoping she regains her cat indifference again soon.
02-06-2018T21:41:20,unsteddyphoenix,Tom is her only friend/soulmate
02-06-2018T21:41:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Pet the wee baby
02-06-2018T21:41:43,SageSaga,you know what might help Tom?
02-06-2018T21:41:53,unsteddyphoenix,being overly affectionaate to her?
02-06-2018T21:41:53,Twokinds,?
02-06-2018T21:41:55,FenceEqualizer,More attention?
02-06-2018T21:41:58,unsteddyphoenix,Until she gets annoyed?
02-06-2018T21:41:58,Dadrobit,Catnip?
02-06-2018T21:42:05,SageSaga,doing your homework
02-06-2018T21:42:15,unsteddyphoenix,Ok what is the homework
02-06-2018T21:42:18,Dadrobit,Shoulda' seen that one coming.
02-06-2018T21:42:25,Dadrobit,Guessing it's DnD related.
02-06-2018T21:42:29,Twokinds,"I was, but she interrupted."
02-06-2018T21:42:33,SageSaga,XD
02-06-2018T21:43:01,unsteddyphoenix,"So basically ""my cat ate my homework"""
02-06-2018T21:46:09,Dadrobit,... I wonder how often that happens in Mekkan? Bored kids making their keidran eat their work?
02-06-2018T21:47:00,Dadrobit,"""Kat, can you help me with my homework real quick?"" -Eric probably"
02-06-2018T21:47:17,unsteddyphoenix,The real reason kat learnt to read
02-06-2018T21:47:24,unsteddyphoenix,So she could do the homework instead of eating it
02-06-2018T21:47:51,Dadrobit,She learned via osmosis at first.
02-06-2018T21:48:03,unsteddyphoenix,hahahaha
02-06-2018T21:48:08,FenceEqualizer,Kid: Coooome on eat my homework otherwise i'll fail my Templar test. Dog Keidran: That is beneath me sir... Kid: Come on! I'll bring back those cookies you love if you do
02-06-2018T21:48:10,unsteddyphoenix,Man if that worked...
02-06-2018T21:49:01,Dadrobit,Bi-lingual dictionaries would sell pretty well probably.
02-06-2018T21:49:21,Dadrobit,Wanna learn Spanish? Have dinner.
02-06-2018T21:49:49,FenceEqualizer,That has to be cheating
02-06-2018T21:49:58,unsteddyphoenix,"Follow a recipie for a spanish dish, which actually includes the recipie in the recipie"
02-06-2018T21:51:11,Dadrobit,"Dated a Mexican girl for a long time, maybe that's where I learned to cook?"
02-06-2018T21:51:53,unsteddyphoenix,Makes sense to me
02-06-2018T21:52:23,FenceEqualizer,The effects of dating someone who likes to cook. Second hand cooking
02-06-2018T21:52:40,Dadrobit,"(Technically she was American, but both Mexican parents)"
02-06-2018T21:53:51,Dadrobit,"Actually haven't had Mexican since Friday, should probably fix that tonight."
02-06-2018T21:54:52,FenceEqualizer,Sounds like a job for Taco salads
02-06-2018T21:55:37,Dadrobit,"Just ate a couple hours ago though, probably gonna be a super late dinner."
02-06-2018T21:56:01,Dadrobit,"I think Ericberto's is 24hr, might hit them up."
02-06-2018T21:56:15,unsteddyphoenix,.
02-06-2018T21:57:36,unsteddyphoenix,Did Marv name that store
02-06-2018T21:58:26,FenceEqualizer,Hah!
02-06-2018T21:58:30,Dadrobit,You'd think so. But probably not.
02-06-2018T21:58:45,Dadrobit,I think we had this conversation last time I went there.
02-06-2018T21:58:56,unsteddyphoenix,I did get a sense of dejavu
02-06-2018T21:59:30,JamesBSquirrel3,"WWHHAATT??! Oh no, it finish while I was asleep!?! It can't be predect 6 and the half hours, as it is. Damnit! I shouldn't know other guys was there without say goodbye, but that's history.:ptv-sad:reee Next time someday."
02-06-2018T21:59:50,Dadrobit,That fucking ree.
02-06-2018T21:59:52,Dadrobit,I lost it
02-06-2018T22:00:04,unsteddyphoenix,Hahahaha
02-06-2018T22:00:30,unsteddyphoenix,"Unlucky James, but yeah that's history"
02-06-2018T22:00:41,FenceEqualizer,I can't... just can't.
02-06-2018T22:01:41,FenceEqualizer,Well James there's always the recordings.
02-06-2018T22:02:34,JamesBSquirrel3,Man. I guess I'll have to fight another day soon. At least I can assuring on YouTube yet as it is.
02-06-2018T22:03:14,unsteddyphoenix,Is it on purpose? Is he a genius?
02-06-2018T22:03:39,Dadrobit,I feel like it's Google Translate at work?
02-06-2018T22:05:11,unsteddyphoenix,I guess...I feel like that would be even less accurate somehow.
02-06-2018T22:05:36,Dadrobit,"Ah, I might have to bounce in a bit, just got a text from the parents who are coming home from a camping trip."
02-06-2018T22:05:54,JamesBSquirrel3,I think someone will know from 4th to 5th. As Top 5 are done? And the a rest of Runners-Up are have to leave another day?
02-06-2018T22:05:56,Dadrobit,"They shredded a tire, and then found out that their spare is nearly 20 years old."
02-06-2018T22:06:09,unsteddyphoenix,oh dear
02-06-2018T22:06:33,Dadrobit,"So the put on a tire from a completely different vehicle that's bigger than it should be, but still kinda works."
02-06-2018T22:06:37,Dadrobit,they*
02-06-2018T22:07:20,Dadrobit,"James, runners up are never done. They're just there to show what came close. To tease us."
02-06-2018T22:07:46,Dadrobit,But all top 5 were colored today.
02-06-2018T22:08:16,FenceEqualizer,And to shed manly tears. Also hopefully your folks are close
02-06-2018T22:08:35,FenceEqualizer,Wouldn't trust drivng that for long.
02-06-2018T22:08:48,JamesBSquirrel3,"I know I have before, whatever a case as it is, I always sure of it."
02-06-2018T22:10:34,Dadrobit,"They're about 3 hours northeast of me, just south of the Hopi/Navajo Reservation."
02-06-2018T22:10:35,JamesBSquirrel3,"Well, at the some of you still there, then I guess I'll have to say goodnight them"
02-06-2018T22:10:44,Dadrobit,"Night, James."
02-06-2018T22:10:57,unsteddyphoenix,seeya later james
02-06-2018T22:12:20,JamesBSquirrel3,"Thanks, I did best it could as always, take care you guys :ptv-ice: Nighty-night!"
02-06-2018T22:13:57,FenceEqualizer,Goodnight James
02-06-2018T22:16:44,FenceEqualizer,"That's pretty far with a spare, Robit."
02-06-2018T22:18:05,Dadrobit,Especially since they're towing a good couple tons through mountain roads.
02-06-2018T22:18:51,Dadrobit,"Though they already were on their way, so here's hoping I don't have to go play Uber for them out in the middle of nowhere."
02-06-2018T22:21:49,FenceEqualizer,They might want to stop at the nearest walmart. The only place I can think of that sells tires late
02-06-2018T22:24:09,Dadrobit,Dunno if they're already past Payson or not. Only city in the path big enough.
02-06-2018T22:24:23,Dadrobit,And still an hour plus from home.
02-06-2018T22:27:07,Bgrmystr2,"""Next time someday"" holy shit my sides"
02-06-2018T22:28:08,FenceEqualizer,Then may that tire be a fighter. Also You leave our chat A.I mascot alone.
02-06-2018T22:28:41,Bgrmystr2,NO :ptv-pouty:
02-06-2018T22:28:44,Bgrmystr2,It

02-06-2018T23:26:38,Trevuxnouxe,well good night anyway
02-06-2018T23:26:49,CrRAR,hehe
02-06-2018T23:27:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I just have the two cats
02-06-2018T23:27:12,CrRAR,oh good
02-06-2018T23:27:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Peeka is a Pac man frog
02-06-2018T23:28:12,CrRAR,"wow, lol if I didn't have google, I'd a claimed you made that up XD"
02-06-2018T23:28:38,CrRAR,very round
02-06-2018T23:28:41,CrRAR,much mouth
02-06-2018T23:28:44,CrRAR,wow
02-06-2018T23:29:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"Their actual name is Amazon Horned Frog, but Pac Man frog rings with people better"
02-06-2018T23:29:28,unsteddyphoenix,Wait youve lost some cat
02-06-2018T23:29:31,unsteddyphoenix,!!!
02-06-2018T23:29:33,SpazztasticKiwi,She‚Äôs almost 2
02-06-2018T23:29:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I think
02-06-2018T23:30:21,SpazztasticKiwi,And they get big. Peeka is about twoish pounds
02-06-2018T23:30:43,CrRAR,ooo
02-06-2018T23:30:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Can‚Äôt exactly weigh her. She doesn‚Äôt stay still when I pick her up
02-06-2018T23:31:25,CrRAR,I imagine frogs prefer live critters?
02-06-2018T23:31:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Peeka eats flash frozen fuzzy mice
02-06-2018T23:31:58,CrRAR,wow
02-06-2018T23:32:10,CrRAR,That is one metal frog breed
02-06-2018T23:32:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Live prey is risky - mouse could bite her and cause a bad wound
02-06-2018T23:32:39,CrRAR,mmm
02-06-2018T23:32:57,CrRAR,Is that their typical diet in the wild?
02-06-2018T23:33:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Their instinct is to bite anything that walks in front of them
02-06-2018T23:33:41,SpazztasticKiwi,And not let go until it‚Äôs swallowed
02-06-2018T23:34:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Top reason they die in the wild is choking on something because they‚Äôre too stubborn to let it go
02-06-2018T23:34:41,SpazztasticKiwi,They‚Äôll even try eating another frog even if it‚Äôs bigger than them
02-06-2018T23:34:51,CrRAR,munchmunchmunch
02-06-2018T23:35:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"Almo, they do have teeth, so don‚Äôt go putting your hands in front of one"
02-06-2018T23:36:34,SpazztasticKiwi,*also
02-06-2018T23:36:55,CrRAR,So they do more of a lunge? No tongue action?
02-06-2018T23:38:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"A lunge, yeah. The tongue isn‚Äôt terribly long, but sticky"
02-06-2018T23:38:52,SpazztasticKiwi,More of a means to trap and draw prey into the mouth thing
02-06-2018T23:39:20,SpazztasticKiwi,They‚Äôre not an animal that‚Äôs better g on moving alot
02-06-2018T23:39:32,SpazztasticKiwi,*big on
02-06-2018T23:39:47,CrRAR,Yeah getting smacked upside the head with a sudden tongue would be highly disorienting. lol
02-06-2018T23:40:29,CrRAR,power move of the pond~
02-06-2018T23:40:36,SpazztasticKiwi,They can get to be about the size of a dinner plate I believe
02-06-2018T23:40:47,CrRAR,holy crap
