30-03-2018T00:00:34,SageSaga,it doesnt cost 5500 dollars to print out a comic
30-03-2018T00:00:38,Vatruvius,How would an enchiladas know?
30-03-2018T00:00:45,MagicEnchilladas,acording to designtaxi.com
30-03-2018T00:01:13,SageSaga,do you know what kind of ink? do you know how much you can print with a liter?
30-03-2018T00:01:19,TheFDdriver,then why you even print it?
30-03-2018T00:01:29,Vatruvius,Real gold leaf ink Sage...only the best.
30-03-2018T00:01:43,Bgrmystr2,xD
30-03-2018T00:01:47,SageSaga,because just saying something cost X without knowing that doesnt help you
30-03-2018T00:01:55,Bgrmystr2,print with SOLID 24K GOLD ink
30-03-2018T00:02:14,Vatruvius,That comic page may be really heavy...but damn does it look good.
30-03-2018T00:02:35,MagicEnchilladas,hp black printer cartridge is about $25 for 4.5 ml
30-03-2018T00:02:40,Bgrmystr2,"""The gold bar on this comic page looks incredibly realistic!"""
30-03-2018T00:02:45,TheFDdriver,it has a ultra vibrant colour that its ultra reflective
30-03-2018T00:03:00,SageSaga,wait- who uses an HP Black printer cartridge to print comics?
30-03-2018T00:03:13,MagicEnchilladas,that is a great question
30-03-2018T00:03:25,Bgrmystr2,prolly ppl that have ordinary printers at home lol
30-03-2018T00:03:47,Bgrmystr2,"not artists, likely"
30-03-2018T00:03:50,SageSaga,if you were going to print something like a comic- use a Kinkos or online printing service

30-03-2018T00:44:21,Dadrobit,"I guess you could say there's an ""attraction"" there."
30-03-2018T00:44:24,Bgrmystr2,Clovis would be so mad that he didn't think of it himself first.
30-03-2018T00:44:25,Vatruvius,Nora would enact revenge on Trace in some many ways.
30-03-2018T00:44:45,Vatruvius,so* not some
30-03-2018T00:45:43,FenceEqualizer,She's only made cause Trace isn't doing it.

30-03-2018T00:49:12,unsteddyphoenix,Tom please confirm this absolutely happened in canon
30-03-2018T00:49:22,BluePhantom90,I know but the original made her look more worried and scared like
30-03-2018T00:49:31,Dadrobit,There's a reason the thought bubble was taken out yo. Retcon'd into canon.
30-03-2018T00:49:38,Bgrmystr2,"Even if it did happen, it's still happening in her mind."
30-03-2018T00:49:41,InTheLionsDen,"It is canon, in a Raine fic."
30-03-2018T00:49:48,Bgrmystr2,"the thought bubble hasn't happened yet dadro, it wasn't taken out xD"
30-03-2018T00:50:00,unsteddyphoenix,Everything happens in your mind when you get down to it :thinking:
30-03-2018T00:50:01,Vatruvius,It is getting hot at night now where I live and my dog want the whole bed to stay cool!
30-03-2018T00:50:12,Bgrmystr2,"only stuff you think about, phoenix :P"

30-03-2018T00:52:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
30-03-2018T00:52:11,unsteddyphoenix,Technically true
30-03-2018T00:52:17,Vatruvius,Just because you sponsored it does not mean it is cannon @iliar

30-03-2018T00:53:22,Vatruvius,Hmm...
30-03-2018T00:53:26,Vatruvius,So...
30-03-2018T00:53:33,Bgrmystr2,"simultaniously, nothing is canon as well."
30-03-2018T00:53:43,Vatruvius,"All those sketches, colors, and Raine fics?"
30-03-2018T00:53:51,Vatruvius,Darn!
30-03-2018T00:54:01,Bgrmystr2,All canonically uncanon.
30-03-2018T00:54:06,Dadrobit,"Yup, nothing is canon, including all of the Keith and Nat do a thing."
30-03-2018T00:54:31,unsteddyphoenix,"They are both canon and not canon, therefore existing in a 3rd state where they are both canon and not canon at the same time..."
30-03-2018T00:54:31,Vatruvius,But aren't some considered cannon?
30-03-2018T00:54:33,FenceEqualizer,And like that Robit trigger'd half the viewer base.
30-03-2018T00:54:45,w0lfmare,Yes. everyone knows keith and nat do nothing all day
30-03-2018T00:54:47,Dadrobit,It's what I do.
30-03-2018T00:55:07,MagicEnchilladas,Schrodinger's fic?
30-03-2018T00:55:08,TheFDdriver,we know THAT
30-03-2018T00:55:22,Bgrmystr2,I'm thankful that I'm not the half that gets up in arms about Nat and Keith
30-03-2018T00:55:31,Bgrmystr2,:v
30-03-2018T00:55:45,SageSaga,how awkward do you have to be to write fan fiction about your IRL friends?
30-03-2018T00:55:48,Unenlagia,Same
30-03-2018T00:55:54,BluePhantom90,"You know Tom when you asked before about pushing out more comic's with lower quality, Did you mean more like less background scenes, or grass details?"
30-03-2018T00:55:57,Vatruvius,Only Natani and Keith...nothing else! :ptv-angry: *pitchfork and torch in hand*
30-03-2018T00:55:58,Dadrobit,"Oh, trust me, they're a great buncha' people Bgr"
30-03-2018T00:56:01,Vatruvius,:ptv-hearts:
30-03-2018T00:56:03,Unenlagia,"Pretty dang awkward, Sage"
30-03-2018T00:56:05,Bgrmystr2,"dunno, Sage. Some ppl have no problems with it Sage"
30-03-2018T00:56:07,unsteddyphoenix,I had a friend do that to me
30-03-2018T00:56:13,unsteddyphoenix,He was pretty awkward yeah
30-03-2018T00:56:19,Bgrmystr2,SageSage mc sagey.
30-03-2018T00:56:54,FenceEqualizer,I would say that's a 7 on the scale of akward.
30-03-2018T00:57:09,FenceEqualizer,Bonus points if they try to make that fanfiction a reality.
30-03-2018T00:57:11,TheFDdriver,12
30-03-2018T00:57:40,Bgrmystr2,"Don't see why it's awkward at all? People gonna ship ships, and you can't do anything about it lol"
30-03-2018T00:57:42,Vatruvius,What if one of those friends secretly likes your comic Sage but they did not want you to know?
30-03-2018T00:57:42,Dadrobit,Undiagnosed Asperger's out of 10.
30-03-2018T00:57:43,w0lfmare,But Raine's never had friends to write fanfiction about before
30-03-2018T00:57:51,w0lfmare,It's all Mary's fault
30-03-2018T00:58:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,poor raine
30-03-2018T00:58:04,Bgrmystr2,"why would they not want sage to know, Vatru?"
30-03-2018T00:58:08,unsteddyphoenix,Raine is very awkward
30-03-2018T00:58:17,FenceEqualizer,This is to go even further beyond.
30-03-2018T00:58:26,Vatruvius,It is a hypothetical Bgr...think about it.
30-03-2018T00:58:38,Bgrmystr2,don't call the screaming fence D;
30-03-2018T00:58:45,Bgrmystr2,it doesn't end!
30-03-2018T00:58:53,SageSaga,"""Raine- why is it that in every sex scene your OC shows up and gets involved? Like seriously- every - single- time-"""
30-03-2018T00:59:03,Bgrmystr2,"I'm thinking that it makes no sense, Vatru."
30-03-2018T00:59:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
30-03-2018T00:59:08,FenceEqualizer,Raine is as pure as the day is bright. It's Raine you have to worry about.
30-03-2018T00:59:13,TheFDdriver,lol
30-03-2018T00:59:37,unsteddyphoenix,Raine fans lying to themselves up in here
30-03-2018T00:59:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-rainehappy: = Purest being
30-03-2018T01:00:00,Dadrobit,People are fans of Raine?
30-03-2018T01:00:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,me am
30-03-2018T01:00:11,TheFDdriver,she prolly KNOWS...

30-03-2018T01:00:18,w0lfmare,Says the guy who ships Sage and Tom
30-03-2018T01:00:24,Vatruvius,Wait a minute...there has been no sketch or color of humanRaine with her fanfics.
30-03-2018T01:00:24,FenceEqualizer,See Marv that's the Raine you have to worry about.
30-03-2018T01:00:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,but she's so cute
30-03-2018T01:00:46,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shipit: W0lf XD
30-03-2018T01:00:50,unsteddyphoenix,I'll have you know i'll NEVER admit to writing any fanfics about sage and tom
30-03-2018T01:01:03,SageSaga,so in Norse mythology the gods played a game that involved throwing deadly objects at the Son of Light
30-03-2018T01:01:09,Vatruvius,Which just guarantees that you have unsteddy.
30-03-2018T01:01:11,unsteddyphoenix,Even when sage calls him a cute fabio asian
30-03-2018T01:01:20,w0lfmare,XD
30-03-2018T01:01:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
30-03-2018T01:01:30,FenceEqualizer,PFFT!
30-03-2018T01:01:39,Vatruvius,What Sage...really? Who is the God of Light?
30-03-2018T01:01:48,SageSaga,Baldur
30-03-2018T01:01:56,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
30-03-2018T01:02:00,Vatruvius,Hmm...
30-03-2018T01:02:03,FenceEqualizer,You literally made me spit water and I am mad at you.
30-03-2018T01:02:07,Vatruvius,The more you know.
30-03-2018T01:02:11,GameForge,its really bright in tehre for it being a cave
30-03-2018T01:02:19,w0lfmare,Is that the mistletoe one?
30-03-2018T01:02:22,MagicEnchilladas,yes
30-03-2018T01:02:28,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-reniderp:
30-03-2018T01:02:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-sleepoverB:
30-03-2018T01:02:37,Bgrmystr2,xD
30-03-2018T01:02:57,SageSaga,yep- the person who finally ended the game was his blind cousin who threw a dart made of mistletoe which pierced his heart and killed him
30-03-2018T01:03:21,SageSaga,Loki was the one who made and gave the dart to him
30-03-2018T01:03:22,FenceEqualizer,"I like that story. All the objects in the world said ""We shall not harm Baldur"" cause Freya is crazy"
30-03-2018T01:03:25,Vatruvius,Pierced whose heart?
30-03-2018T01:03:26,TheFDdriver,"well. I'm going to take a nap, thanks for the streams"
30-03-2018T01:03:33,unsteddyphoenix,"Shot through the heart, he's to blame"
30-03-2018T01:03:37,SageSaga,Baldurs heart
30-03-2018T01:03:43,FenceEqualizer,"But the mistle toe said "" Baldur? No F*** that guy"""
30-03-2018T01:03:48,MagicEnchilladas,apparently mistletoe was too young to sign legally binding contracts
30-03-2018T01:04:06,Vatruvius,So the game ended because they killed the object of the game?
30-03-2018T01:04:15,Bgrmystr2,you could say Baldur had a kiss with death. :P
30-03-2018T01:04:30,unsteddyphoenix,ooo not bad not bad~
30-03-2018T01:04:33,SageSaga,actually not far off but most said it wasnt asked because they didnt believe such a weak plant that had to survive by clinging to others could ever harm him to begin with
30-03-2018T01:04:46,MagicEnchilladas,Baldur could have been revived by Hell if every creature wept for him
30-03-2018T01:05:31,Tokagedraws,so did Trace do that to Nora or did he find her like that?
30-03-2018T01:05:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,found
30-03-2018T01:05:41,FenceEqualizer,But Loki is a colossus dick.
30-03-2018T01:05:46,Tokagedraws,oh oki
30-03-2018T01:05:47,MagicEnchilladas,such a scamp
30-03-2018T01:05:50,Vatruvius,Norse mythology sounds a little fucked up. I mean...it is cool and all but...hmm...you pulling my leg here Sage?
30-03-2018T01:06:01,MagicEnchilladas,that is the mythos
30-03-2018T01:06:01,SageSaga,?
30-03-2018T01:06:09,SageSaga,that story is real
30-03-2018T01:06:41,FenceEqualizer,Most Mythology is alittle F'd up...should see what Zeus was like.
30-03-2018T01:06:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Tom, how many layers are you on right now?"
30-03-2018T01:07:05,MagicEnchilladas,"""Zeus keep it in your pants""-pretty much everyone"
30-03-2018T01:07:05,Vatruvius,What...vikings just thought about there gods playing a game like that and killing him with mistletoe? What were they doing...getting drunk! Wait...vikings...drunk...makes sense now.
30-03-2018T01:07:07,w0lfmare,We don't talk about Zeus *head shake*
30-03-2018T01:07:14,MagicEnchilladas,"zeus- ""TOO LATE"""
30-03-2018T01:07:20,SageSaga,Just like the story about Loki turning into a horse to seduce a horse away from its work so his father wouldnt have to obey the deal he made with the craftsmen
30-03-2018T01:07:23,Sammit,Zeus was more reckless than Drunk Thor
30-03-2018T01:07:31,SageSaga,and Loki ended up getting raped and had a baby
30-03-2018T01:07:32,unsteddyphoenix,Ah ive seen that porno
30-03-2018T01:07:36,FenceEqualizer,afjskhakjsfhja
30-03-2018T01:07:37,unsteddyphoenix,I mean what
30-03-2018T01:07:38,MagicEnchilladas,slepnir
30-03-2018T01:07:38,unsteddyphoenix,nothing
30-03-2018T01:07:43,SageSaga,and Odin rides his grandson into battle-
30-03-2018T01:07:44,FenceEqualizer,I do NOT remember that story!
30-03-2018T01:08:10,BluePhantom90,"hmm sounds like a funny story of the reall ""Princess and the frog"" with the Prince's loyal servant had metal barbs warped around his heart to keep his heart from breaking, and when he was happy his heart was breaking the barbs holding his heart"
30-03-2018T01:08:21,Vatruvius,Wait...Loki got fucked or the other way around? Why would he be a female horse?
30-03-2018T01:08:27,Bgrmystr2,xDD Sage
30-03-2018T01:08:29,Vatruvius,Part of the seduction?
30-03-2018T01:08:33,Bgrmystr2,"cuz they're gods, Vatru"
30-03-2018T01:08:34,MagicEnchilladas,loki is a mother
30-03-2018T01:08:35,Bgrmystr2,probably
30-03-2018T01:08:39,SageSaga,because the other horse was male
30-03-2018T01:08:47,SageSaga,so loki became a female horse
30-03-2018T01:08:52,unsteddyphoenix,Otherwise thats just gay
30-03-2018T01:09:01,unsteddyphoenix,Which is way weirder best to change genders
30-03-2018T01:09:05,Vatruvius,"Thor finds out. Loki, ""Speak of this to NO ONE!"""
30-03-2018T01:09:12,Bgrmystr2,what would Loki have done if the other horse was gay? xD
30-03-2018T01:09:21,FenceEqualizer,Gods have way too much free time.
30-03-2018T01:09:22,Bgrmystr2,or was that blasphemy?
30-03-2018T01:09:31,unsteddyphoenix,smited the horse
30-03-2018T01:09:33,MagicEnchilladas,i think thor reminded loki of that when thor had to wear a dress
30-03-2018T01:09:37,Bgrmystr2,hahaha phoenix xD
30-03-2018T01:10:12,qwe304,:cqwe304-11680:
30-03-2018T01:10:30,Vatruvius,When did that heart on the neck shackle get there!?!
30-03-2018T01:10:47,Bgrmystr2,when tom drew it.
30-03-2018T01:10:49,unsteddyphoenix,thats the keyhole
30-03-2018T01:10:57,Vatruvius,Thanks Bgr.
30-03-2018T01:10:59,unsteddyphoenix,Shackles can only be unlocked with the power of love~

30-03-2018T01:11:30,Bgrmystr2,because it's supposed to be Lodious.
30-03-2018T01:11:34,FenceEqualizer,"Tom, Nora needs a cold bath. Also great work"

30-03-2018T01:15:04,iliar,@unsteddyphoenix What's you mean?
30-03-2018T01:15:15,Bgrmystr2,"sounds like your end, dadro, cuz there isn't gonna be anything on his site"
30-03-2018T01:15:21,unsteddyphoenix,Popup?
30-03-2018T01:15:36,Twokinds,Really?
30-03-2018T01:15:40,Twokinds,Mobile or web?
30-03-2018T01:15:43,Dadrobit,"Tried to redirect me to ""win-help.com"" and was asking for a password and username."
30-03-2018T01:15:53,Vatruvius,I have never gotten popups on his site.
30-03-2018T01:15:57,Vatruvius,Hmm...
30-03-2018T01:16:00,Bgrmystr2,"that screams malware, dadro lol"
30-03-2018T01:16:15,Twokinds,Send it to keenspot@gmail.com tell them whether it was mobile or web
30-03-2018T01:16:18,unsteddyphoenix,"really weird, we're not getting it at least"
30-03-2018T01:16:19,SageSaga,yeah it is more likely you have something on your PC making that happen and not his site
30-03-2018T01:16:21,Vatruvius,Pratically every popup screams malware.
30-03-2018T01:16:29,BadFoMo,Or why I have AdBlocker.
30-03-2018T01:16:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Tried it on mobil, no pop up"
30-03-2018T01:16:38,Dadrobit,"Yeah, it was a load of bullshit, sent off little sirens and yelled that a virus was detected. Trying to blow out my speakers."
30-03-2018T01:16:47,unsteddyphoenix,Turn off adblocker on Toms site
30-03-2018T01:16:51,Dadrobit,"I'll hit them up, thanks."
30-03-2018T01:17:05,BadFoMo,No way.
30-03-2018T01:17:14,Zakuru,those always scare me to no end
30-03-2018T01:17:19,unsteddyphoenix,"The hell, do it. What kind of fan are you lol."
30-03-2018T01:17:30,Dadrobit,:/ Why would you adblock Tom?
30-03-2018T01:17:43,Vatruvius,It has been a very long time since I ever came across those. Every time I did I had a little panic attack.
30-03-2018T01:17:49,Dadrobit,"Also, gonna run a virus check on my computer just in case."
30-03-2018T01:17:51,Zakuru,^
30-03-2018T01:17:53,Bgrmystr2,loaded the site with and without ublock
30-03-2018T01:17:58,Bgrmystr2,"neither one gave me that, dadro"
30-03-2018T01:18:06,Bgrmystr2,so that definitely sounds like a you thing.
30-03-2018T01:18:12,Bgrmystr2,though it could have been the ad that popped up
30-03-2018T01:18:16,BadFoMo,You see extra stuff that's under the ads.
30-03-2018T01:18:28,qwe304,the fractions of a cent he would b=get from me f=viewing ads doesnt really compare to my patreon donation
30-03-2018T01:18:43,Vatruvius,The noises...just make it stop...what do I do...it won't close...JUST MAKE IT STOP! :ptv-whiny:
30-03-2018T01:18:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,and Tom's still going
30-03-2018T01:18:56,Tokagedraws,so is there no longer a day where comics will be drawn?
30-03-2018T01:18:59,Dadrobit,Sup Vat?
30-03-2018T01:19:16,Bgrmystr2,"yup, it happens vatru. You just get a good antivirus and a good manual scan antimalware"
30-03-2018T01:19:21,Bgrmystr2,"and you're good, generally."
30-03-2018T01:19:26,TheBeckoner,L e w d
30-03-2018T01:19:27,Bgrmystr2,just keep a keen eye on where you go
30-03-2018T01:19:28,TheBeckoner,heyo
30-03-2018T01:19:31,Vatruvius,Just showing my reaction to getting those ads.
30-03-2018T01:19:40,BadFoMo,"...Also, I don't want to risk seeing something I don't want to see."
30-03-2018T01:19:55,qwe304,"just saw the new schedule, RIP: Wednesday streams"
30-03-2018T01:20:06,TheBeckoner,Been up there for awhile now
30-03-2018T01:20:14,unsteddyphoenix,"Youre bad, Bad."
30-03-2018T01:20:15,Vatruvius,Yeah...I am very well protected now. I have not come across those ads in forever. But when I was 13...it scared me to death.
30-03-2018T01:20:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,its been that way for about a week
30-03-2018T01:20:22,Bgrmystr2,slow qwe xD
30-03-2018T01:20:24,qwe304,"hence ""just saw"""
30-03-2018T01:20:46,Bgrmystr2,been that way since last thursday yeh
30-03-2018T01:21:01,GameForge,that heart tho
30-03-2018T01:21:16,Dadrobit,I blame clicking on links that Sage allowed earlier.
30-03-2018T01:21:25,Bgrmystr2,xD Dadro pls
30-03-2018T01:21:29,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha
30-03-2018T01:21:33,Vatruvius,Her breath smoke should form a heart in the air.
30-03-2018T01:21:33,FenceEqualizer,Sage allowed links?
30-03-2018T01:21:37,Vatruvius,Just a very faint one.
30-03-2018T01:21:44,Bgrmystr2,to like.. a discord image
30-03-2018T01:21:49,FenceEqualizer,What crazy 3rd dimension did I end up in?
30-03-2018T01:21:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,octopus gif
30-03-2018T01:21:56,SageSaga,i always allow links that are approved and when they ask
30-03-2018T01:22:10,Vatruvius,So...no porn pics Sage?
30-03-2018T01:22:17,SageSaga,i still cant believe how many people dont realize that
30-03-2018T01:22:20,Bgrmystr2,"definitely not, vatru"
30-03-2018T01:22:33,SageSaga,its a SFW stream so - yeah- no
30-03-2018T01:22:47,Vatruvius,Drats...because I have so many favorited you know.
30-03-2018T01:22:48,TheBeckoner,Is Nora's hair like a mane?
30-03-2018T01:22:52,FenceEqualizer,Got to keep the legends strong.
30-03-2018T01:22:56,TheBeckoner,is that how its spelled?
30-03-2018T01:23:01,FenceEqualizer,"Vat, plz."
30-03-2018T01:23:03,Bgrmystr2,and you can keep them out of the SFW stream :u
30-03-2018T01:23:12,Bgrmystr2,"for your own safety, mostly"
30-03-2018T01:23:23,BadFoMo,"looks at Tom's stream. ""Safe for work?"""
30-03-2018T01:23:30,Bgrmystr2,"Yes, Fomo. It is."
30-03-2018T01:23:38,unsteddyphoenix,Do you see any nipples?
30-03-2018T01:23:39,Vatruvius,Is this really a SFW stream...I feel like if I was working I would have to argue that point with my manager.
30-03-2018T01:24:05,Mihari,Technically the term SFW is questionable any means since I doubt very many workplaces would allow watching a stream so... yah.
30-03-2018T01:24:05,FenceEqualizer,The fact that you have the chance to argue
30-03-2018T01:24:07,Bgrmystr2,It is. The fact that you CAN argue it with your manager is proof enough.
30-03-2018T01:24:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,it is a sfffwwfwfw stream
30-03-2018T01:24:19,qwe304,id definitly have a lot of explaining to do if my boss saw this XD
30-03-2018T01:24:29,w0lfmare,Safe for w0lf
30-03-2018T01:24:34,SageSaga,the term SFW has been skewed a lot
30-03-2018T01:24:35,unsteddyphoenix,Probably naked humans would be safer for work than clothed furries
30-03-2018T01:24:36,FenceEqualizer,Ba dum tsh
30-03-2018T01:24:37,Sammit,"there is no nipples or sexual organs shown so is SFW, i think"
30-03-2018T01:24:49,unsteddyphoenix,or sexy dragons
30-03-2018T01:24:52,Dadrobit,Lemme consult my boss real quick.
30-03-2018T01:24:53,Bgrmystr2,"dunno bout that, Phoenix lol"
30-03-2018T01:25:00,Vatruvius,lol
30-03-2018T01:25:00,Mihari,It's been skewed based on who uses it and where you mean :P
30-03-2018T01:25:10,Mihari,SFW is still pretty clear when it comes to actual work place XD
30-03-2018T01:25:11,Vatruvius,Nice knowing you had a job @Dadrobit
30-03-2018T01:25:22,Dadrobit,He says it's Gucci
30-03-2018T01:25:29,Bgrmystr2,"There, see"
30-03-2018T01:25:29,unsteddyphoenix,What a cool guy
30-03-2018T01:25:35,FenceEqualizer,"""I swear this isn't a porn drawing...this....is a drawing that's being made for my...DnD group...It involves a wizard."""
30-03-2018T01:25:37,SageSaga,technically a person who draws porn for their job is SFW when drawing porn for them-
30-03-2018T01:25:38,unsteddyphoenix,Hey tell him I said hi for me
30-03-2018T01:25:45,Dadrobit,Gotcha
30-03-2018T01:25:47,SageSaga,so obviously we go with a broader meaning
30-03-2018T01:26:04,Bgrmystr2,"they don't really count Sage, cuz they don't have anything that would be NSFW"
30-03-2018T01:26:16,Mihari,^
30-03-2018T01:26:16,Vatruvius,Nothing wrong with it...I am currently unemployed and going to school so all good over here.
30-03-2018T01:26:19,SageSaga,sure they do
30-03-2018T01:26:26,SageSaga,anything illegal would be NSFW
30-03-2018T01:26:31,Vatruvius,But seriously I do not have a lot of porn pics...none actually...just to make that clear.
30-03-2018T01:26:42,Mihari,"Pfft, I could argue a few people otherwise on that one XD"
30-03-2018T01:26:47,Bgrmystr2,I don't think I'd put nsfw in the same category as illegal lol
30-03-2018T01:26:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,so punching someone in the dark is nsfw?
30-03-2018T01:26:58,qwe304,"i was stuck using an old ipod as my sole mobile device for a while, and the easiest way to get pics onto it was to email it to myself, in doing so i very nearly sent some definitely nsfw pics to my employers HR department."
30-03-2018T01:26:58,FenceEqualizer,Yes
30-03-2018T01:27:01,Bgrmystr2,yeh marv hahaha
30-03-2018T01:27:03,SageSaga,doesnt matter where you would put it
30-03-2018T01:27:05,FenceEqualizer,Why would you do that at work you bully
30-03-2018T01:27:11,Dadrobit,"Unless it's in the UFC, Marv."
30-03-2018T01:27:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,good to know
30-03-2018T01:27:23,Mihari,"And yes, you can poke holes at every to make a point, but large by far there is one general accepted meaning when it comes to non-porn, self employed, or otherwise workplaces."
30-03-2018T01:27:34,Mihari,Cause we all know there are exceptions to everything.
30-03-2018T01:27:36,Mihari,Still...
30-03-2018T01:27:45,MagicEnchilladas,actually i believe it wouldn't be safe due to the insufficient lighting
30-03-2018T01:27:48,FenceEqualizer,Think it depends on who you punch Robit
30-03-2018T01:28:03,SageSaga,we try to use a broader term - in the case of Picarto - it's what Picarto deams NSFW
30-03-2018T01:28:08,Sammit,For a Miner not wearing a helmet is NSFW
30-03-2018T01:28:10,SageSaga,deems*
30-03-2018T01:28:16,Bgrmystr2,Sammit pls
30-03-2018T01:28:24,BadFoMo,@Twokinds There's moar?!
30-03-2018T01:28:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,don't let your deems be deams
30-03-2018T01:28:28,BrunoYcaro,hes right tho
30-03-2018T01:28:31,SageSaga,So anything that doesnt fall under their terms for NSFW is SFW
30-03-2018T01:28:33,qwe304,imma sleep see yall sunday :cqwe304-11680:
30-03-2018T01:28:33,Bgrmystr2,yeah Fomo

30-03-2018T01:28:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Qwe
30-03-2018T01:28:41,Dadrobit,Unscrewing their helmet light bulb is abuse of a miner.
30-03-2018T01:28:46,Bgrmystr2,"the image he just finished, Tokage"
30-03-2018T01:28:47,FenceEqualizer,Night Qwe

30-03-2018T01:29:50,Bgrmystr2,yeah will prolly be done soonish
30-03-2018T01:29:51,Vatruvius,At this rate my computer will run out of battery.
30-03-2018T01:30:02,Bgrmystr2,tell your pc it's weaksauce
30-03-2018T01:30:42,Vatruvius,It is actually pretty strong...which is why it has a weak battery. Powering a 4k display is not easy.
30-03-2018T01:31:00,Bgrmystr2,battery is weaksauce :P
30-03-2018T01:31:09,Bgrmystr2,still part of the computer
30-03-2018T01:31:12,Dadrobit,Your moves are weak brah
30-03-2018T01:31:12,TheBeckoner,Download more battery
30-03-2018T01:31:17,Bgrmystr2,"exactly, beck"
30-03-2018T01:31:22,Bgrmystr2,or just plug it into the wall
30-03-2018T01:31:23,Vatruvius,I get a good hour and a half out of it. Currently says I have another 45 minutes left.
30-03-2018T01:31:33,Bgrmystr2,why u no.. wall outlet?
30-03-2018T01:31:36,Bgrmystr2,like normal computer?
30-03-2018T01:31:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,use potatos

30-03-2018T02:19:34,SpazztasticKiwi,The usual?
30-03-2018T02:19:47,Dadrobit,Nora Card from iliar
30-03-2018T02:20:03,Dadrobit,It was the one where Nora recalls her times getting personal with Trace
30-03-2018T02:20:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m sure it was
30-03-2018T02:20:22,SpazztasticKiwi,interesting
30-03-2018T02:20:27,Dadrobit,Where she's tied up with chains
30-03-2018T02:20:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Tastefully done I’m sure
30-03-2018T02:21:11,Dadrobit,Completely
30-03-2018T02:21:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I was hoping to watch a little but my phone was dying
30-03-2018T02:22:06,SpazztasticKiwi,It stayed 3% for like 5 hours
30-03-2018T02:22:27,unsteddyphoenix,It's ok if it's a dragon so
30-03-2018T02:22:29,TheBeckoner,Gotta hypermile on that low battery
30-03-2018T02:23:13,Twokinds,"I just realized ""Hello? Earth to Nora"" is a phrase that's inherently anachronistic."
30-03-2018T02:23:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Please don’t use big words so late
30-03-2018T02:23:41,SpazztasticKiwi,😄
30-03-2018T02:24:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"Kinda, but it’s not like many of us notice"
30-03-2018T02:25:07,Twokinds,"Yeah, I mean, technically everything is just being translate"
30-03-2018T02:25:22,unsteddyphoenix,I don't know this word
30-03-2018T02:25:35,Twokinds,What word?
30-03-2018T02:25:41,Twokinds,I meant translated
30-03-2018T02:25:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, question"
30-03-2018T02:25:54,TheBeckoner,Means in the wrong time period
30-03-2018T02:26:16,TheBeckoner,I think
30-03-2018T02:26:40,unsteddyphoenix,"Anachronistic, yeah. I'm gonna look this up"
30-03-2018T02:28:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"Are Keidran/Bastion taught their languages alongside English or separately from English (one first, other second)"
30-03-2018T02:28:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"I know some don’t learn English ever, right?"
30-03-2018T02:28:32,Twokinds,Basitins are all taught Human
30-03-2018T02:28:49,SpazztasticKiwi,*Basitins
30-03-2018T02:28:57,Twokinds,For plot convenien- I mean from their close historical alliance.
30-03-2018T02:29:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"I swear, it always autocorrects to Bastion"
30-03-2018T02:29:17,TheBeckoner,"Do the humans all speak ""Human"" or are there other versions of it? Like spanish or something?"
30-03-2018T02:29:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Riiight that
30-03-2018T02:29:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Got it
30-03-2018T02:30:00,Twokinds,"There aren't other human languages, but there are other dialects."
30-03-2018T02:30:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Like different accents?
30-03-2018T02:30:13,Twokinds,Same with Keidran. A Keidran can tell if a wolf grew up among foxes.
30-03-2018T02:30:15,unsteddyphoenix,Lower human
30-03-2018T02:30:24,TheBeckoner,Ahh ok
30-03-2018T02:30:53,TheBeckoner,So like through word usage or accents and such? Like Rose
30-03-2018T02:31:23,Twokinds,Both regional and culteral
30-03-2018T02:31:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Kinda like when Flora was snubbed by those tribal tiger ladies
30-03-2018T02:32:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Because she had a human-like lit to her accent
30-03-2018T02:32:20,Twokinds,Yeah
30-03-2018T02:32:34,unsteddyphoenix,Flora speaks lower keidran right
30-03-2018T02:32:49,Dadrobit,So being an adult means making decisions.
30-03-2018T02:33:01,Dadrobit,Today I decided I would go with the burrito option.
30-03-2018T02:33:03,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/FjjaRNc.jpg
30-03-2018T02:33:25,TheBeckoner,Lol what an amalgamation...
30-03-2018T02:33:26,Twokinds,Good cho- are those fishsticks?
30-03-2018T02:33:47,unsteddyphoenix,How has this happened
30-03-2018T02:33:48,Dadrobit,Cheesy fishstick and rice burito
30-03-2018T02:33:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I should slap the taste out of your mouth for showing me that mess

30-03-2018T02:34:43,Bgrmystr2,"you say that as if there's anything wrong with it, Fence lol"
30-03-2018T02:34:50,Twokinds,lol thank goodness
30-03-2018T02:35:01,Bgrmystr2,it's just something else ppl put on stuff
30-03-2018T02:35:07,Twokinds,I'm not a fan of siracha but that's a relief
30-03-2018T02:35:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Things heating up in the burrito fandom
30-03-2018T02:35:20,unsteddyphoenix,He says uputting ketchup on his steak
30-03-2018T02:35:36,Twokinds,That's different.
30-03-2018T02:35:42,Bgrmystr2,XD
30-03-2018T02:35:57,Twokinds,Ketchup complements a well-done steak.
30-03-2018T02:35:58,unsteddyphoenix,Its worse
30-03-2018T02:36:01,Dadrobit,"I wanted to use Macayo's, but I didn't have enough for a full burrito."
30-03-2018T02:36:15,Dadrobit,Wait... well-done.... what is that?
30-03-2018T02:36:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Hey ketchup isn’t terrible on steak
30-03-2018T02:36:18,unsteddyphoenix,Ok I regret bringing it up
30-03-2018T02:36:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I like a little lemon sometimes on mine
30-03-2018T02:36:49,Bgrmystr2,ahhahaha god forbid people actually cook the food they plan to eat.
30-03-2018T02:36:50,FenceEqualizer,Ketchup is the last resort on a very dry steak.
30-03-2018T02:36:52,Bgrmystr2,Love these conversations
30-03-2018T02:36:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Burnt to death
30-03-2018T02:36:55,Bgrmystr2,makes me laugh every single time
30-03-2018T02:36:58,unsteddyphoenix,Not ok

30-03-2018T02:37:31,Dadrobit,"Look, I may make burritos out of fish sticks and rice, but at least I know how to eat a steak."

30-03-2018T02:38:28,Bgrmystr2,"it's in your name, after all"

30-03-2018T02:38:37,Twokinds,"Black on the outside and cooked all the way through. Then, if it's too tough, just add more ketchup."
30-03-2018T02:38:38,SpazztasticKiwi,hooman

30-03-2018T02:40:05,Dadrobit,If a steak needs A1. It was cooked wrong.
30-03-2018T02:40:10,TheBeckoner,^

30-03-2018T02:44:46,unsteddyphoenix,Fair
30-03-2018T02:44:58,Dadrobit,Like spaghetti tacos.
30-03-2018T02:45:22,Dadrobit,Which were awesome in their own right.
30-03-2018T02:45:22,FenceEqualizer,Those things do not belong.
30-03-2018T02:45:51,FenceEqualizer,...Then again....am curious. :thinking:
30-03-2018T02:46:22,Dadrobit,Still need to make a curry. Might do that Sunday.
30-03-2018T02:46:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I had scrambled hash brown and egg with sausage and cheese
30-03-2018T02:47:28,Twokinds,That sounds pretty good
30-03-2018T02:47:31,FenceEqualizer,See that sounds like a reasonable combination of foods.
30-03-2018T02:47:57,Twokinds,"Yeah, wait a minute, that's normal food! Get that out of here!"

30-03-2018T02:48:24,FenceEqualizer,What's the weirdest science experiment you've cooked Robit?
30-03-2018T02:48:35,Dadrobit,...
30-03-2018T02:48:42,Dadrobit,That's a tough one.
30-03-2018T02:49:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve eaten fried cheese sticks and gravy
30-03-2018T02:49:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Coworker asked if I was pregnant
30-03-2018T02:49:31,Dadrobit,I think my seven layer taco cake is probably pretty up there.
30-03-2018T02:49:36,unsteddyphoenix,Mozerrella sticks?
30-03-2018T02:49:38,Bgrmystr2,"don't mention butter in front of phoenix, Kiwi. He froths at the mouth. lool"

30-03-2018T02:51:25,Dadrobit,"I basically got huge tortillas, and layered them inbetween stuff like beans, salsa, beef, cheese, other assorted stuffs"
30-03-2018T02:51:41,Dadrobit,"Until I had what looked like a cake, made out of taco stuffs"
30-03-2018T02:51:43,Bgrmystr2,ahh.. so it's a layered.. thing
30-03-2018T02:51:45,Bgrmystr2,okay

30-03-2018T02:51:58,Dadrobit,Then I baked it and brought it to a party.
30-03-2018T02:52:04,Dadrobit,It was a good time.
30-03-2018T02:52:08,unsteddyphoenix,Ogres have layers
30-03-2018T02:52:14,FenceEqualizer,Sounds like a pizza cake.

30-03-2018T02:54:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"Ever cooked anything fun, Tom?"
30-03-2018T02:54:41,FenceEqualizer,Think it would be the same as a shepard pie. Or lasanga.
30-03-2018T02:55:08,Twokinds,Unfortunately not
30-03-2018T02:55:28,SpazztasticKiwi,You a person that burns water?

30-03-2018T02:56:16,Twokinds,It's very good. It's just meatloaf.
30-03-2018T02:56:27,Dadrobit,Made form demons from Hell?
30-03-2018T02:56:30,Twokinds,lol

30-03-2018T02:56:50,Twokinds,My great grandmother's last name was Doom.
30-03-2018T02:56:51,SpazztasticKiwi,It ain’t meat loaf if it ain’t mamas

30-03-2018T02:56:59,unsteddyphoenix,that's where the best spice is
30-03-2018T02:57:00,FenceEqualizer,I can feel the cholesterol just from the name.
30-03-2018T02:57:13,SpazztasticKiwi,That was mentioned once
30-03-2018T02:57:19,Dadrobit,That's pretty badass
30-03-2018T02:57:28,Bgrmystr2,I was half expecting Doctor Doom's mother to be a cook
30-03-2018T02:57:34,Bgrmystr2,and to have a meatloaf recipe
30-03-2018T02:57:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Could’ve been “Thomas Doom”

30-03-2018T02:58:25,Bgrmystr2,goddamn family things.
30-03-2018T02:58:25,Twokinds,"Well, my dad's father was a doctor. If she had kept the name, he'd have been Doctor Doom."
30-03-2018T02:58:36,FenceEqualizer,grandfather doom.
30-03-2018T02:58:40,Bgrmystr2,oh holy shit

30-03-2018T02:59:12,FenceEqualizer,"Also Robit, that taco cake would make for sneaky april fools joke if done right."
30-03-2018T02:59:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Explains why there’s explosive talent in the family :ptv-dealwithit:
30-03-2018T02:59:38,unsteddyphoenix,Is doom also a German name cause that would make sense
30-03-2018T03:00:00,Twokinds,I have no idea.
30-03-2018T03:00:02,Dadrobit,"Lol, Fence. Use sour cream to cover it and make it look like regular frosting?"
30-03-2018T03:00:21,unsteddyphoenix,I believe
30-03-2018T03:00:28,Twokinds,I've never traced my geneology.
30-03-2018T03:00:42,Twokinds,At least not far.
30-03-2018T03:00:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"Ancestory.com, here I come"
30-03-2018T03:00:55,FenceEqualizer,Yes!

30-03-2018T03:01:01,Twokinds,My mother's father was born and raised in what's now North Korea.
30-03-2018T03:01:07,unsteddyphoenix,"I would've looked into doom, personally"
30-03-2018T03:01:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m sure it’d be interesting
30-03-2018T03:01:39,Twokinds,"He was actually from a pretty well-off family, before they had to flee. Hard times after that."
30-03-2018T03:01:41,unsteddyphoenix,Ah my friend has the same thing
30-03-2018T03:01:48,Twokinds,Especially after he had 6 daughters trying to get a son.
30-03-2018T03:01:50,Twokinds,XD
30-03-2018T03:01:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Ouch
30-03-2018T03:01:59,unsteddyphoenix,Ooooo unlucky
30-03-2018T03:02:30,SpazztasticKiwi,My parents were hoping for a son
30-03-2018T03:02:33,SpazztasticKiwi,They got me
30-03-2018T03:02:41,Dadrobit,"Mhmm, Great and great, great granparents were in a similar situation felling from Germany and the UK mostly during WW2"
30-03-2018T03:02:50,Dadrobit,following*
30-03-2018T03:03:11,Dadrobit,fleeing* I don't know how to English
30-03-2018T03:03:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I know what you mean
30-03-2018T03:03:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve almost messed up a few times really bad with my English
30-03-2018T03:04:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Near death experience
30-03-2018T03:04:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Almost swore in front of a pastor
30-03-2018T03:05:26,Bgrmystr2,I don't really know anything about my ancestory..
30-03-2018T03:05:42,Bgrmystr2,never found it interesting I guess
30-03-2018T03:07:49,Twokinds,I just know the buck stops here
30-03-2018T03:08:02,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
30-03-2018T03:08:08,Dadrobit,"Same, no babies!"
30-03-2018T03:08:16,Bgrmystr2,xD

30-03-2018T03:08:33,Twokinds,"Luckily, I end up living forever."
30-03-2018T03:08:36,Dadrobit,My siblings already had too many.
30-03-2018T03:09:01,unsteddyphoenix,No children no cry
30-03-2018T03:09:14,Dadrobit,I think I have 12 nieces and nephews?
30-03-2018T03:09:28,Bgrmystr2,Lucky Dadro
30-03-2018T03:09:39,Dadrobit,I've changed enough diapers already thank you.
30-03-2018T03:09:55,unsteddyphoenix,Cool uncle status
30-03-2018T03:10:00,Bgrmystr2,at least you have brothers and sisters tho :u
30-03-2018T03:10:42,Dadrobit,"Yeah, 12, had to count em up there."
30-03-2018T03:10:53,SpazztasticKiwi,My sister and I don’t want kids either
30-03-2018T03:11:08,SpazztasticKiwi,But my mom wants grandchildren
30-03-2018T03:11:09,Dadrobit,Damn straight unsteddy
30-03-2018T03:11:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I tell her I have two cats. There’s her grandchildren
30-03-2018T03:11:40,unsteddyphoenix,"Same kiwi, but we ain't doing it"
30-03-2018T03:11:44,Bgrmystr2,"that's not the same, Kiwi"
30-03-2018T03:11:50,Dadrobit,But my dad is super unhappy with me about not having kids.
30-03-2018T03:12:02,Bgrmystr2,"understandable, dadro xD"
30-03-2018T03:12:20,SpazztasticKiwi,What’s not the same
30-03-2018T03:12:24,Dadrobit,"I'm like, dude, you already have a dozen grandkids already!"
30-03-2018T03:12:42,Bgrmystr2,"Kiwi, you do realize that having kids and having pets is totally different, right"
30-03-2018T03:12:52,Dadrobit,Pets listen more.
30-03-2018T03:13:02,Dadrobit,And cost way less.
30-03-2018T03:13:05,unsteddyphoenix,He's right pets are superior in every way
30-03-2018T03:13:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Well it’s gonna have to be
30-03-2018T03:13:10,Bgrmystr2,pets actually mature WAY quicker than humans.
30-03-2018T03:13:23,Bgrmystr2,and don't live nearly as long.. so
30-03-2018T03:13:25,Dadrobit,And you can teach them where to poop waaaaaaaaaay faster.
30-03-2018T03:13:27,Twokinds,no pets!
30-03-2018T03:13:35,Bgrmystr2,"too late tom, you have lots xD"
30-03-2018T03:13:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"It takes two to tango, and even if I marry, I don’t plan to have kids"
30-03-2018T03:13:58,unsteddyphoenix,YES PETS HOLLY IS LIVING WITH YOU FOREVER
30-03-2018T03:13:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"In fact, I plan to stop getting animals after mine pass"
30-03-2018T03:14:12,Dadrobit,"If I ever have a kid, I'm just gonna adopt, like, a nine year old. So he/she appreciates me from the get-go."
30-03-2018T03:14:15,Twokinds,"Hm, wait"
30-03-2018T03:14:19,Twokinds,I think I see a solution in this
30-03-2018T03:14:25,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
30-03-2018T03:14:35,Twokinds,Combining a child and a pet...
30-03-2018T03:14:40,Bgrmystr2,aw NO
30-03-2018T03:14:42,Bgrmystr2,TOM
30-03-2018T03:14:42,Bgrmystr2,no
30-03-2018T03:14:43,Twokinds,It's the perfect solution.
30-03-2018T03:14:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Hard pass
30-03-2018T03:14:50,Dadrobit,Fullmetal alchemist?
30-03-2018T03:14:59,unsteddyphoenix,some sort of....pet...daughter?
30-03-2018T03:15:03,SpazztasticKiwi,That goes against so many laws of nature
30-03-2018T03:15:15,Dadrobit,Hold on. Aren't you people all furries? Don't y'all want that kinda stuff?
30-03-2018T03:15:29,FenceEqualizer,Calm down there Shou.
30-03-2018T03:15:34,Bgrmystr2,"Phoenix you may have just ruined that comic for me, now that I've mentally thought about dadro's statement"
30-03-2018T03:15:42,unsteddyphoenix,I'm not a furry for as long as tom isnt
30-03-2018T03:15:46,Bgrmystr2,"but meh, who am I kidding, that lil comic is adorable"
30-03-2018T03:16:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Have you ever stopped to think what a full sized bipedal tiger or wolf would be like
30-03-2018T03:16:03,FenceEqualizer,I am on the fence at best Robit
30-03-2018T03:16:12,Bgrmystr2,"like any normal one, Kiwi? but standing up?"
30-03-2018T03:16:18,unsteddyphoenix,Floofy
30-03-2018T03:16:22,Dadrobit,"Yes, I've had huge dogs standing up dancing with me before."
30-03-2018T03:16:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Exactly
30-03-2018T03:16:30,Bgrmystr2,"a lot of the larger ones are pretty human-sized, if they're standing on their legs."
30-03-2018T03:16:40,Bgrmystr2,sometimes larger
30-03-2018T03:16:51,Dadrobit,It's adorable. Still not gonna stick my dick in it.
30-03-2018T03:16:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I doubt it’d be very enjoyable to come across
30-03-2018T03:17:07,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, just doesn't seem any much different than what they are now :u"
30-03-2018T03:17:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Nor am I Dadrobit
30-03-2018T03:17:14,FenceEqualizer,Errr...
30-03-2018T03:17:25,Bgrmystr2,welcome back fence lol
30-03-2018T03:17:30,Dadrobit,That heartens me Spazz
30-03-2018T03:17:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"That was a joke, don’t worry"
30-03-2018T03:18:12,unsteddyphoenix,But what about a dragon
30-03-2018T03:18:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Hakuna your ta tas
30-03-2018T03:18:23,FenceEqualizer,This chat has some of the randomish conversations.
30-03-2018T03:18:33,SpazztasticKiwi,You have no idea
30-03-2018T03:18:37,Dadrobit,"Depends, how much of the hoard do I get?"
30-03-2018T03:18:41,Bgrmystr2,Yeeeeup fence. This is standard chat.
30-03-2018T03:18:56,unsteddyphoenix,Negotiable
30-03-2018T03:18:56,FenceEqualizer,Can we just be friends?
30-03-2018T03:19:19,Dadrobit,I'll get the good contract paper.
30-03-2018T03:20:05,Dadrobit,"I argue for pay nearly on the daily, I got this on lockdown."
30-03-2018T03:20:12,FenceEqualizer,That's going to be a weird contract for a lawyer to read.
30-03-2018T03:20:53,FenceEqualizer,"""And Mr. Robit get's half the hoard but he has to XXX on the daily, no questions asked."""
30-03-2018T03:21:20,Dadrobit,Daily?
30-03-2018T03:21:25,unsteddyphoenix,Chains optional but preferred
30-03-2018T03:21:28,SpazztasticKiwi,“Has this man had a psych eval yet?”
30-03-2018T03:22:07,FenceEqualizer,Your dragon has to get their money worth.
30-03-2018T03:22:08,Dadrobit,"Yes, I am sound of mind. IQ of 116 last I checked."
30-03-2018T03:22:27,unsteddyphoenix,Wow dad.
30-03-2018T03:22:51,Dadrobit,I am literally average.
30-03-2018T03:23:32,Dadrobit,"Though, to be fair, that test was years ago, might have lost a few points since then."
30-03-2018T03:23:47,Twokinds,Or gained! :D
30-03-2018T03:24:13,unsteddyphoenix,What you lost in height you gained in INT
30-03-2018T03:24:24,Dadrobit,"Awwwww, the optimism is heartwarming."
30-03-2018T03:24:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I must be smarter than all of you then
30-03-2018T03:25:08,SpazztasticKiwi,If short=smart
30-03-2018T03:25:28,Dadrobit,Looking at an IQ rarity chart. I'm not one in a million. I'm one in six lol.
30-03-2018T03:26:03,unsteddyphoenix,Did you take a proper test
30-03-2018T03:26:52,Dadrobit,"Yeah, administered by a proper psychologist years ago after my crash."
30-03-2018T03:27:19,Dadrobit,I did not get my pop's smarts unfortunately lol.
30-03-2018T03:27:30,unsteddyphoenix,Psychologist s can give those tests? Til
30-03-2018T03:27:35,Dadrobit,He's legit in the genius percentile.
30-03-2018T03:30:01,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I had a minor concussion and they wanted to see if my perception skills were all still functioning."
30-03-2018T03:30:46,Dadrobit,Took a bit over two hour IIRC
30-03-2018T03:30:54,Dadrobit,hours*
30-03-2018T03:33:38,FenceEqualizer,Sounds like it would be stressful. Two hours to know where you range on the IQ scale
30-03-2018T03:34:46,unsteddyphoenix,Ignorance is dumbliss
30-03-2018T03:37:47,Dadrobit,Well it's about perception and memory and stuff.
30-03-2018T03:38:08,Dadrobit,So they need to give you time to forget some things.
30-03-2018T03:38:21,Dadrobit,"Or rather, try not to forget things."
30-03-2018T03:38:29,unsteddyphoenix,"I did one of those super reliable online tests once and it was all like, pattern recognition"
30-03-2018T03:38:34,Dadrobit,Like: Apple Bank Park
30-03-2018T03:38:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I gotta go to bed guys
30-03-2018T03:38:51,unsteddyphoenix,gnight
30-03-2018T03:39:06,Dadrobit,The three words she told me to memorize at the beginning of the session lol.
30-03-2018T03:39:13,Dadrobit,night spazz
30-03-2018T03:39:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Later chat - later Tom
30-03-2018T03:39:41,Dadrobit,Still got em in my head 10 year later
30-03-2018T03:39:45,Dadrobit,years
30-03-2018T03:39:51,unsteddyphoenix,What a genius
30-03-2018T03:40:06,Dadrobit,I wish
30-03-2018T03:40:37,Dadrobit,I only remember because I forgot one of them.
30-03-2018T03:40:40,Dadrobit,Apple
30-03-2018T03:40:45,Dadrobit,I said Orange
30-03-2018T03:40:52,unsteddyphoenix,points for trying
30-03-2018T03:41:07,FenceEqualizer,Late but night Kiwi
30-03-2018T03:41:08,Dadrobit,"I knew it came from a tree, just couldn't quite nail it."
30-03-2018T03:41:16,Dadrobit,The proctor got a good laugh though.
30-03-2018T03:43:18,Dadrobit,"And it had fun weird question like, An arrow is to a triangle as a triangle is to (One of five other shapes)"
30-03-2018T03:43:54,Dadrobit,I remember that was a strangely stressful question type.
30-03-2018T03:44:01,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: Pyramid?
30-03-2018T03:44:22,Bgrmystr2,I dunno
30-03-2018T03:44:24,Bgrmystr2,lol
30-03-2018T03:44:31,Dadrobit,"I don't recall everything lol. I think it had a straight line, a less than symbol, stuff like that."
30-03-2018T03:44:46,unsteddyphoenix,"It'd be a less than symbol, then"
30-03-2018T03:44:52,Bgrmystr2,yeah that
30-03-2018T03:45:06,Dadrobit,"Shit, maybe, I dunno."
30-03-2018T03:45:26,Bgrmystr2,cuz that's the line that changed
30-03-2018T03:45:30,unsteddyphoenix,Im curious now
30-03-2018T03:45:31,unsteddyphoenix,Hold on
30-03-2018T03:45:50,Bgrmystr2,not knowing the answers doesn't exactly help us lol
30-03-2018T03:45:56,Dadrobit,I think you could maybe try Mensa or something and see if they offer a decent IQ test
30-03-2018T03:46:02,Bgrmystr2,cuz there's a pretty large lack of context
30-03-2018T03:46:31,unsteddyphoenix,http://test.mensa.no/
30-03-2018T03:46:35,unsteddyphoenix,Go do this test dad
30-03-2018T03:46:42,Dadrobit,"I was just giving an example to show what kinds of questions there are, not actually test y'all."
30-03-2018T03:46:51,Dadrobit,"Ayyyyy, lookit that."
30-03-2018T03:47:14,unsteddyphoenix,Im interested to see how different the result would be
30-03-2018T04:08:15,FenceEqualizer,Oof 103. AM a dunce.taking that again when i'm more awake
30-03-2018T04:08:34,FenceEqualizer,Speaking of which off to dream land. Goodnight all.
30-03-2018T04:08:39,unsteddyphoenix,Isn 100 average
30-03-2018T04:08:42,unsteddyphoenix,goodnight~
30-03-2018T04:09:18,FenceEqualizer,Is that average? Not so bad then. Ego saved
30-03-2018T04:15:07,Dadrobit,Got 123
30-03-2018T04:15:09,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/ehLQrST.png
30-03-2018T04:15:26,Dadrobit,\o/ I went up
30-03-2018T04:16:21,unsteddyphoenix,Nice~ how did it compare to the real one
30-03-2018T04:16:27,Dadrobit,"Though, probably not the most official thing in the world, it was pretty close to the style of the testing I did."
30-03-2018T04:16:47,Dadrobit,Because that was almost all logic based stuff.
30-03-2018T04:17:02,Dadrobit,And the full battery includes a lot of memory style things.
30-03-2018T04:17:17,unsteddyphoenix,I see~
30-03-2018T04:17:28,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I thought that was weird
30-03-2018T04:17:43,Dadrobit,Did you take it?
30-03-2018T04:18:04,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, little while ago"
30-03-2018T04:18:54,unsteddyphoenix,I got like...133 I wanna say. 13-something. But like you said im skeptical
30-03-2018T04:19:02,unsteddyphoenix,Of both this test and IQ in general
30-03-2018T04:19:44,Dadrobit,"Especially since it's got that ""Share on Facebook"" button so conveniently located right after the test."
30-03-2018T04:19:58,unsteddyphoenix,Lol they know their demographic
30-03-2018T04:20:13,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah ive been listening to this ""Jordan Peterson"" guy and he got me curious."
30-03-2018T04:24:53,Dadrobit,"Looked up the author of the test you found. Seems at least he himself is a Mensa member, so at least it's not some psych undergrad who made a Facebook test for a class project."
30-03-2018T04:25:19,Dadrobit,Anything in particular from Peterson?
30-03-2018T04:26:12,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I tried to find ones that like...werent complete horseshit
30-03-2018T04:26:58,unsteddyphoenix,"Mmm, this is the one I was thinking of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-Ur71ZnNVk"
30-03-2018T04:31:09,Dadrobit,"Hm, I'm definitely gonna look into this guy, he seems enjoyable to listen to."
30-03-2018T04:32:51,unsteddyphoenix,He's very well spoken
30-03-2018T04:33:38,unsteddyphoenix,Some of what he says is pretty controversial but he delivers his opinion in a really fluid way
30-03-2018T04:36:19,Dadrobit,"That happens with pretty much any intellectual/philosophizer person. Like I really enjoy listening to Allen Watts, but I certainly don't agree with everything."
30-03-2018T04:40:50,unsteddyphoenix,"True, it'd be weird to find a speaker and agree with everything"
30-03-2018T04:41:12,unsteddyphoenix,Honestly i'll listen to any opinion as long as it can hold my interest
30-03-2018T04:43:53,Dadrobit,"I think it comes down to ""has the person I'm listening to only thought about what they're talking about, or did they analyze it."""
30-03-2018T04:44:22,Dadrobit,That's kinda how my dad taught me how people think.
30-03-2018T04:45:21,Dadrobit,"""Everyone thinks, even stupid people think. It's people who actually analyze what they're thinking about who are smart."""
30-03-2018T04:45:47,Dadrobit,More or less paraphrased.
30-03-2018T04:46:34,unsteddyphoenix,"That's a good way to look at it. I get what youre saying, I think."
30-03-2018T04:46:55,unsteddyphoenix,A lot of these speakers get attacked from every angle you can think of but they can still defend their position well.
30-03-2018T04:48:15,Dadrobit,Probably because they've already thought of how their arguments can be attacked and have formulated the responses already.
30-03-2018T04:59:15,unsteddyphoenix,Im watching this Alan Watts now lol. Good trade.
30-03-2018T04:59:44,Dadrobit,"And I've got a few Peterson videos lined up, thanks kindly."
30-03-2018T10:35:05,Vatruvius,Wow...still a fair amount of people on. Good morning! :ptv-greetings:
30-03-2018T10:35:14,Vatruvius,Hello Sage...is this still a merged chat?
30-03-2018T12:23:07,TheGamePlayer,Hi everyone
30-03-2018T12:24:34,TheGamePlayer,What do you think is in the third floor room that Trace mustn't see?
30-03-2018T12:25:36,TheGamePlayer,"Oh hi Sage, Nero"
30-03-2018T12:57:01,Vatruvius,Sage has not responded so I assume he is not on in this chat. As for what is in the room...I have no idea.
30-03-2018T13:45:43,Bgrmystr2,"you'd be wrong, vatru :P"
30-03-2018T13:46:01,Bgrmystr2,"the chat is still fused, and sage is still here"
30-03-2018T13:46:11,Bgrmystr2,"you can see the user list anytime you want, you know"
30-03-2018T13:49:38,ZRO4825,"shhhh, don't go giving away trade secrets Bgr"
30-03-2018T13:55:07,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: maybe you're right. the chat seems to break every time someone does that.
30-03-2018T13:57:15,Bigboi182,Yo!
30-03-2018T13:57:49,Bigboi182,Sage is the only mod here...

30-03-2018T13:59:55,Bgrmystr2,it already broke :P
30-03-2018T15:00:54,Vatruvius,Desolate looks scary as shit.
30-03-2018T15:09:42,Vatruvius,And...I bought it...because I like to shit myself.
30-03-2018T16:09:41,Vatruvius,:P
30-03-2018T19:33:16,Vatruvius,The chat is empty...too empty.
30-03-2018T20:19:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Boo
30-03-2018T20:25:12,Vatruvius,Agh!
30-03-2018T20:25:23,Vatruvius,:ptv-shock:
30-03-2018T20:30:21,Sunfish43,fill it up!
30-03-2018T23:10:02,Vatruvius,*whistling to fill the silence*
