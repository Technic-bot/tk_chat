27-12-2018T00:22:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Got snow?
27-12-2018T00:23:47,Ordithus,11 inches and it is still falling
27-12-2018T00:24:08,Ordithus,I am so exhausted
27-12-2018T00:35:21,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s the snow
27-12-2018T00:35:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Drains your life force to stay frozen
27-12-2018T00:36:14,Ordithus,"Well, it definitely is the snow, and it takes a lot of energy to shovel all that, so yes.  It did drain my life force."
27-12-2018T00:36:24,Ordithus,Though it was going to stay frozen anyways
27-12-2018T00:36:58,Bgrmystr2,it'll melt when the sun burns the planet
27-12-2018T00:37:00,Bgrmystr2,just wait till then

27-12-2018T00:38:15,Bgrmystr2,"oh don't worry, as long as you live forever like tom does, a few hundred.. million? years? Or so.. billion? Plus or minus a zero or three. Honestly, it'll be fine."
27-12-2018T00:38:47,Ordithus,Why don't we in the northern climes just ski everywhere
27-12-2018T00:38:55,Bgrmystr2,yeah!

27-12-2018T00:39:25,Ordithus,that would be a sight
27-12-2018T00:39:33,Ordithus,"small black coupe, giant tracks"
27-12-2018T00:39:59,Bgrmystr2,"hell yeah, they only cost like.. oh damn I don't recall... 2k a tire or something?"
27-12-2018T00:41:35,Bgrmystr2,or were these the one that was like 12-15k...? :ptv-wondering: or was that the price of four..?
27-12-2018T00:41:46,Bgrmystr2,it's been so damn long I really just don't remember at all...
27-12-2018T00:41:51,Ordithus,"I dunno, but like this https://goo.gl/images/4Q8EJr"

27-12-2018T00:43:57,Ordithus,"Oooh yeah, I've seen that before.  Much less invasive.  Just drive on and drive away"
27-12-2018T00:48:01,Bgrmystr2,yeah prettymuch
27-12-2018T00:48:07,Bgrmystr2,I want some tracks myself
27-12-2018T00:48:18,Bgrmystr2,"set em up, go offroad"
27-12-2018T00:48:29,Bgrmystr2,dunno if they'd be any good for swamps though lol
27-12-2018T00:48:30,Ordithus,"Pfft, I could use those just to get to work"
27-12-2018T00:48:50,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, living on the gulf coast means 1% chance of winter."
27-12-2018T00:49:01,Bgrmystr2,so..

27-12-2018T09:46:28,MrMongMong,Morning.

27-12-2018T09:52:39,MrMongMong,:ptv-confused:
27-12-2018T09:52:46,MrMongMong,"Ah, Britain."
27-12-2018T09:52:58,CrimsonQuill,"Well, somewhere in that region..."
27-12-2018T09:53:07,MrMongMong,Did you see the patreon debate about Natani?
27-12-2018T09:53:13,CrimsonQuill,Nope7
27-12-2018T09:53:21,CrimsonQuill,Is this about the eggnog?
27-12-2018T09:53:24,MrMongMong,Yep.
27-12-2018T09:53:30,CrimsonQuill,What debate?
27-12-2018T09:53:50,MrMongMong,Someone posted a comment about Natani being female.
27-12-2018T09:53:57,CrimsonQuill,Ah.
27-12-2018T09:54:02,MrMongMong,And things spiraled without Darth
27-12-2018T09:54:03,CrimsonQuill,One of THOSE debates.
27-12-2018T09:54:10,CrimsonQuill,I see.
27-12-2018T09:54:21,MrMongMong,At least they were polite in the later posts.
27-12-2018T09:54:37,CrimsonQuill,"I personally (don't kill me) see Natani as a woman, but along the lines of Vasquez from Aliens."
27-12-2018T09:54:46,CrimsonQuill,Or Trudy from Avatar.
27-12-2018T09:55:30,MrMongMong,"When Natani is in his normal clothes, I see him as a male, but when he isn't, I tend to default to man-woman."
27-12-2018T09:55:52,MrMongMong,"And don't worry, it's ok."
27-12-2018T09:56:10,CrimsonQuill,"To be honest, to me it doesn't matter about gender...what matters is that for all her muck ups, Nat's a badass."
27-12-2018T09:56:20,MrMongMong,Yep. And adorably confused.
27-12-2018T09:56:26,CrimsonQuill,"Let's Face it, she's VERY good with the bow."
27-12-2018T09:56:30,MrMongMong,"""I CAN'T READ"""
27-12-2018T09:56:36,CrimsonQuill,Should lay off the drink though...
27-12-2018T09:57:18,MrMongMong,Maybe he's just bad with alcohol because the only things he drinks are super high alcohol drinks.
27-12-2018T09:57:44,MrMongMong,"Basitin ale, white wolf wine, Very-Alcoholic eggnog, etc."
27-12-2018T09:57:48,CrimsonQuill,"Well, back in Chapter 2, Keith said that Keidran can't handle nearly as much alcohol as humans.."
27-12-2018T09:57:57,CrimsonQuill,"Then again, who says humans can handle alcohol?"
27-12-2018T09:58:18,MrMongMong,I guess the general trend in alcohol tolerance is:
27-12-2018T09:58:27,MrMongMong,Basitan>Human>Keidrian
27-12-2018T09:58:53,CrimsonQuill,"To me, the trend is: If it is alcoholic, STAY AWAY AND STICK WITH TEA,"
27-12-2018T09:59:21,MrMongMong,Tea? Water from the sewage is my poison of choice.
27-12-2018T09:59:29,CrimsonQuill,I follow the Samuel Vimes idea-'One drink is one drink too many'.
27-12-2018T09:59:39,MrMongMong,Very true.
27-12-2018T09:59:52,CrimsonQuill,"That being said, my favourite drink is honestly water."
27-12-2018T10:00:17,MrMongMong,I've tasted alcohol once. As a child. One drop. And I spent the next five minutes gagging. The stuff is bitter.
27-12-2018T10:00:30,MrMongMong,Water is life.
27-12-2018T10:00:35,CrimsonQuill,I tried a cocktail...it tasted vile.
27-12-2018T10:00:40,MrMongMong,CONVERT TO WATERISM.
27-12-2018T10:00:49,CrimsonQuill,"Tea, juice and water."
27-12-2018T10:00:54,CrimsonQuill,Orange juice is nice.
27-12-2018T10:00:58,MrMongMong,Yes.
27-12-2018T10:01:14,MrMongMong,"I've always wondered, why tea?"
27-12-2018T10:01:23,MrMongMong,I notice Europe likes it's tea.
27-12-2018T10:01:25,CrimsonQuill,Because I just love the taste.
27-12-2018T10:01:43,MrMongMong,That is fair.
27-12-2018T10:02:00,CrimsonQuill,"Tea is nice, and it really helps to calm one down."
27-12-2018T10:02:18,MrMongMong,Hammers are better.
27-12-2018T10:02:36,MrMongMong,*At calming people down*
27-12-2018T10:02:39,CrimsonQuill,Ummm...no. Hammers are not better at anger management.
27-12-2018T10:02:50,CrimsonQuill,And...they do leave a headache.
27-12-2018T10:02:54,CrimsonQuill,A nasty one.
27-12-2018T10:03:15,MrMongMong,"No one's ever complained to me. They just sort of, er, run."
27-12-2018T10:03:18,CrimsonQuill,You're better with Sergeant Detritus' 'Piece Maker'.
27-12-2018T10:04:19,MrMongMong,"I don't like things that make loud noises, so I'll stick with the hammer."
27-12-2018T10:04:37,CrimsonQuill,Any idea what the 'Piece Maker' is?
27-12-2018T10:04:53,MrMongMong,"From what I understand, it's either a nuke, or the 7-barreled musket."
27-12-2018T10:05:02,CrimsonQuill,Nope.4
27-12-2018T10:05:03,MrMongMong,I'm not very sure.
27-12-2018T10:05:05,MrMongMong,Ah.
27-12-2018T10:05:09,CrimsonQuill,A converted Siege crossobow.
27-12-2018T10:05:15,CrimsonQuill,Held by a troll.
27-12-2018T10:05:21,MrMongMong,Oh.
27-12-2018T10:05:46,MrMongMong,I still prefer hammers. It's more personal. You get to know people better.
27-12-2018T10:05:54,MrMongMong,(I sound like a serial killer)
27-12-2018T10:05:56,CrimsonQuill,"Never fired at any ONE, but you can be reasonably sure that once Mister Safety catch is off, pulling the trigger should leave no structure within ten meters standing."
27-12-2018T10:06:34,MrMongMong,*Clutches hammer tighter*
27-12-2018T10:06:56,CrimsonQuill,"'Sergeant Detritus, what have I told you about Mister Safety Catch?'"
27-12-2018T10:07:15,CrimsonQuill,"'When Mister Safety Catch is not on, Mister Crossbow is not your friend, sir.'"
27-12-2018T10:07:16,MrMongMong,I think I'll read Discworld. It sounds really funny.
27-12-2018T10:07:23,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, please do."
27-12-2018T10:07:28,CrimsonQuill,Start with Mort.
27-12-2018T10:07:32,MrMongMong,?
27-12-2018T10:07:53,CrimsonQuill,It's the title of one of the books.
27-12-2018T10:08:39,MrMongMong,"Just saw the ""suggested reading order"" chart. I'm scared."
27-12-2018T10:08:42,CrimsonQuill,"Strictly Speaking, 'The Colour of magic' and 'The light Fantastic' were first published, but 'Mort' is the best introduction to the Discworld."
27-12-2018T10:09:09,MrMongMong,Thank you.

27-12-2018T23:08:22,Bgrmystr2,it wouldn't surprise me if it was just something they were doing for more funding.

27-12-2018T23:08:30,Ordithus,"Probably because of the $$$, sadly"

27-12-2018T23:10:50,unsteddyphoenix,I think the issue was they banned him for things he didnt say ON the platform :thinking:
27-12-2018T23:11:01,Bgrmystr2,"I don't think it motivates me, ord"
27-12-2018T23:11:05,MoonDance,Free speech is available but doesn't mean there is no consequence

27-12-2018T23:12:46,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, but the reason he was banned was for things he said offsite. Which wasnt in the terms and conditions or something? Idk."
27-12-2018T23:13:25,BadFoMo,What is that?
27-12-2018T23:13:32,MoonDance,Like you can't say something about a weapon or an in general threat because a potential panic
27-12-2018T23:13:48,Bgrmystr2,"They banned him for something where they have no jurisdiction over. Not that I know what he said, or if it was bad or whatever, but just trying to control things outside of their boundaries."
27-12-2018T23:14:01,Bgrmystr2,that's really the problem imo :/
27-12-2018T23:14:33,Bgrmystr2,and yeah moon that's understandable
