29-05-2018T20:09:36,Vatruvius,"I have a few sketch suggestion to go through, but perhaps I should talk about them closer to the stream Friday?"
29-05-2018T20:10:13,Trevuxnouxe,hi
29-05-2018T20:12:46,CrRAR,oh yeah maybe with a bigger chat group?
29-05-2018T20:14:34,Vatruvius,"Yeah, that is what I thought."
29-05-2018T20:18:04,CrRAR,"though, with so little activity your ideas may be visible here to all for DAYS :DDD"
29-05-2018T20:18:20,CrRAR,think about it
29-05-2018T20:18:30,Vatruvius,This is true.
29-05-2018T20:18:32,CrRAR,DAYSsss!!!!1!
29-05-2018T20:18:39,CrRAR,LOL
29-05-2018T20:19:39,Vatruvius,"One of my ideas is ""Kat going to university. (books in her arms, modern)"""
29-05-2018T20:22:01,CrRAR,"Haha, I could see her so full of wonder at all the potential L E A R N I N G. :DD"
29-05-2018T20:22:20,Vatruvius,Yup.
29-05-2018T20:22:32,Vatruvius,Kat walking into a university library...
29-05-2018T20:22:40,Vatruvius,:ptv-shock:
29-05-2018T20:22:51,CrRAR,Plot twist: The headmaster is somehow Eric. D:
29-05-2018T20:23:27,CrRAR,P E R V E R S I T Y
29-05-2018T20:25:16,Vatruvius,"Roselyn will be the library, no headmasters allowed in the library."
29-05-2018T20:25:24,Vatruvius,librarian*
29-05-2018T20:26:18,CrRAR,"oh good, academic pursuits will be upheld."
29-05-2018T20:26:24,Vatruvius,lol
29-05-2018T20:27:15,Vatruvius,"Another one of my ideas is ""Sniper Kat: Kat in camouflage sitting in a tree waiting to take the shot. (modern)"""
29-05-2018T20:27:27,Vatruvius,"Not really my top suggestion, but I am throwing it out there."
29-05-2018T20:29:45,CrRAR,"Ahhh, that reminds me of the chat tangent about Kat becoming an apprentice assassin to Zen/Natani."
29-05-2018T20:29:57,CrRAR,"Hopefully she'd out-assassin the ""assassins"" though, lol."

29-05-2018T20:31:03,CrRAR,lol
29-05-2018T20:32:14,Vatruvius,"That is an actual sketch, no?"
29-05-2018T20:32:28,Trevuxnouxe,yes

29-05-2018T20:36:01,Vatruvius,"Okay, now for the real sketch suggestion."

29-05-2018T20:36:56,Vatruvius,"""Human Raine on a date on top of a high rise restaurant balcony with draping lights and a view of the sleepless city."" I have not decided on who Raine is on the date with but I am thinking Red to keep with the human theme."
29-05-2018T20:40:16,Trevuxnouxe,"or out of the blue, TRACE"
29-05-2018T20:41:04,CrRAR,"hmm, yeah, gotta be someone with some clout."
29-05-2018T20:41:42,CrRAR,I'd say diplomat Sythe...but he wouldn't be king of the concrete jungle.
29-05-2018T20:42:12,Vatruvius,Clout?
29-05-2018T20:42:13,CrRAR,"Unless he ""phoned"" in some favors."
29-05-2018T20:42:34,CrRAR,clout... like prestige.
29-05-2018T20:42:41,Vatruvius,"If not Red since he is the only viable human, then I was leaning with Zen."
29-05-2018T20:42:52,Vatruvius,I see.
29-05-2018T20:43:58,CrRAR,"Since you mentioned Zen, him automatically."
29-05-2018T20:44:08,CrRAR,he is best boi.
29-05-2018T20:44:18,CrRAR,or so I've heard. haha
29-05-2018T20:44:21,Vatruvius,"Yeah, but then should it be wolfRaine or humanRaine?"
29-05-2018T20:44:40,Vatruvius,I really see humanRaine in this scene.
29-05-2018T20:44:56,Trevuxnouxe,tom? no?
29-05-2018T20:45:14,CrRAR,Yeah she'd look beautiful and get a chance to wear out some sparkly jewelry.
29-05-2018T20:45:40,CrRAR,Jewelry gets lost in fur :&lt;
29-05-2018T20:46:06,Trevuxnouxe,years later...
29-05-2018T20:46:30,CrRAR,"""OH! MY EARRING!"""
29-05-2018T20:47:05,CrRAR,"""so... that's where that went"""
29-05-2018T20:47:12,Vatruvius,"I mean, it could be human Raine and Zen, nothing really wrong with that I guess."
29-05-2018T20:47:19,Vatruvius,But feels kinda off...
29-05-2018T20:47:26,CrRAR,Yeah
29-05-2018T20:47:59,Trevuxnouxe,or for the first time human zen.
29-05-2018T20:48:18,CrRAR,"dancing would be harder in human form, Raine would be very short."
29-05-2018T20:48:23,CrRAR,mmm
29-05-2018T20:48:32,Vatruvius,"Ohh, Raine gives Zen an anklet of humanifaction..."
29-05-2018T20:49:11,Trevuxnouxe,she has a cross neckless in the first time shes in the comic.
29-05-2018T20:49:18,Trevuxnouxe,introduced to it
29-05-2018T20:50:52,Vatruvius,Would this be the first human Zen?
29-05-2018T20:51:28,Trevuxnouxe,maybe
29-05-2018T20:52:21,Vatruvius,I feel like a city scene with the first ever human Zen would be too much to ask in a sketch.
29-05-2018T20:52:45,Vatruvius,Regular Zen and human Raine will be fine I think.
29-05-2018T20:52:53,CrRAR,yeah
29-05-2018T20:53:25,Vatruvius,"Still leaning on Red though because he is human. I guess I will let the chat decide on Friday, Red or Zen."
29-05-2018T20:53:31,Vatruvius,"In either case, human Raine."
29-05-2018T20:53:49,CrRAR,"Yeah, if he isn't okay with both forms he'd be worse than Red. :("
29-05-2018T20:55:05,Vatruvius,That or should I just leave who Raine is with up to Tom? Maybe he will just make a generic guy?
29-05-2018T20:55:39,CrRAR,uhh
29-05-2018T20:55:46,CrRAR,I'd be careful
29-05-2018T20:55:53,CrRAR,"""Raine on a date in the city with CABBAGE MAN!!!"""

29-05-2018T20:56:09,CrRAR,XD
29-05-2018T20:56:19,Vatruvius,"I doubt Tom will do something like that, maybe at the beginning but it would not be the final work."
29-05-2018T20:56:47,CrRAR,the hilarity would be worth it.
29-05-2018T20:57:40,Vatruvius,"However, I feel that if I leave it up to him he may not sketch it because that is something he has to think about unless he already has someone in mind."
29-05-2018T20:57:40,CrRAR,*a Colin randomly appears*
29-05-2018T20:57:44,Vatruvius,lol
29-05-2018T20:57:50,CrRAR,haha
29-05-2018T20:59:40,Vatruvius,But just because Red technically already asked Raine out I will go with him for the sketch.
29-05-2018T21:00:03,Trevuxnouxe,ok tom would have been better
29-05-2018T21:01:10,Vatruvius,"Meh, Tom wouldn't do that."
29-05-2018T21:01:21,Vatruvius,He has never drawn himself in a sketch has he?
29-05-2018T21:01:28,Vatruvius,I don't think he has.
29-05-2018T21:01:31,Trevuxnouxe,idk
29-05-2018T21:02:15,Vatruvius,"It's only because it is human Raine that it has to be Red, if it was wolf Raine then Zen would have been fine."
29-05-2018T21:03:21,Vatruvius,"Alright, I am hopping off for now. :ptv-greetings:"
29-05-2018T21:04:08,Trevuxnouxe,bye
29-05-2018T21:04:10,Vatruvius,It could be that the actual sketch just does not have the guy in frame...
