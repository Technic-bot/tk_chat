21-12-2018T12:32:01,Azumachan,Reminder: No stream Today.
21-12-2018T12:32:35,Ordithus,Thanks Azuma.  I wouldn't be around anyways.
21-12-2018T12:33:08,Azumachan,No but it's a good idea to post it every so often so people won't bother him during Family time.
21-12-2018T12:33:36,Ordithus,Folks will ask
21-12-2018T12:33:39,Ordithus,They always do
21-12-2018T12:34:07,Azumachan,Yeah ...
21-12-2018T12:34:19,Azumachan,I'll do my part.
21-12-2018T12:34:59,Azumachan,Or the nib bot could do it maybe ?
21-12-2018T12:36:11,iliar,"Well.... I can do this. But I think, it actually no needed."

21-12-2018T12:41:18,MrMongMong,How about we do the NibblyBot's job?
21-12-2018T12:41:31,iliar,Tom has two main days for streams: Friday and Sunday. Tom did not promise that he will stream on Saturday. This is the reason why I think there is no need for regular notifications.
21-12-2018T12:41:33,MrMongMong,reminds you that there is no stream today.
21-12-2018T12:41:54,MrMongMong,And have a happy holiday!
21-12-2018T12:42:05,Ordithus,"Yeah, very good point iliar"
21-12-2018T12:42:19,Ordithus,The schedule is right at the top of the chat window already
21-12-2018T12:45:26,Ordithus,If Nibblybot starts emoting :ctwokinds-power: we'll be in trouble
21-12-2018T12:46:23,Azumachan,Raise of the emotes.
21-12-2018T12:48:41,iliar,And at last I don't want add any bot functions without Tom's approval.
21-12-2018T12:49:33,Azumachan,That's a good point.
21-12-2018T12:50:06,Azumachan,I wonder if you can order the bot via alexa / google
21-12-2018T12:50:51,iliar,Order the bot? What you mean?
21-12-2018T12:51:29,Azumachan,Send commands

21-12-2018T12:57:04,Azumachan,"Try to code your own, it's fun after a while."
21-12-2018T12:57:19,Azumachan,That's how it's learned.
21-12-2018T12:57:36,iliar,Some things in the bot's code... not safe.
21-12-2018T12:58:03,zolstarym,"Like dangerous not safe, or NSFW?"
21-12-2018T12:58:21,zolstarym,You don't have nuclear launch codes in that code do you?
21-12-2018T12:58:43,Azumachan,More like personal data in order to connect and such.
21-12-2018T12:59:25,zolstarym,I am mostly curious about how it checks the website for changes and knows when things are posted
21-12-2018T12:59:37,Azumachan,"Youtube, google"
21-12-2018T12:59:53,Azumachan,"Chatbot, python"
21-12-2018T13:01:42,iliar,"Bot has access to many services. Like Telegram, Discord, VKontakte, Patreon, Picarto etc. And I store passwords and access codes in code. I know it's not safe. But while I only person who have access to code it's okay."
21-12-2018T13:04:02,zolstarym,Do you think adding the ability to make comic posts to reddit is possible?
21-12-2018T13:05:44,iliar,Comic Page and Patreon? Bot every few seconds loads http://twokinds.keenspot.com/ and https://api.patreon.com/stream?filter[creator_id]=544858 and check new contect.
21-12-2018T13:07:53,iliar,I don't know. I know about this site. But I don't know how reddit works. Probably I even have not reddit account.

21-12-2018T14:23:50,Aphala,Aww :(
21-12-2018T14:26:29,KapitanGroszek,Iliar! Are you a youtuber?
21-12-2018T14:28:41,iliar,Yea and no. Technically this is my channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqz85zfWtK5NzXmSV-WSSBg but I think this is Tom's channel and I just moderator.
21-12-2018T14:33:55,KapitanGroszek,Omg without you I would never know that Tom is drawing something live
21-12-2018T14:35:08,KapitanGroszek,You are genius
21-12-2018T14:41:39,Aphala,^
21-12-2018T14:53:44,Sifty,what is a good place online to learn how to do stuff in the style that sage and twokinds use
21-12-2018T14:53:45,Sifty,?
21-12-2018T14:54:50,NibblyBot,New Comic Page: Guardian http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/1050/
21-12-2018T14:59:55,BadFoMo,Yo.
21-12-2018T14:59:59,SageSaga,yo
21-12-2018T15:00:03,Aphala,Yo
21-12-2018T15:00:09,FoxxTrotter,:0)
21-12-2018T15:04:03,SageSaga,in a little bit i have to take a break to help my brother in law- hes having computer issues and hes bringing it over for me to check
21-12-2018T15:04:18,FoxxTrotter,That's fine.
21-12-2018T15:04:26,FoxxTrotter,Take your time.
21-12-2018T15:09:51,Sifty,anyone? please?
21-12-2018T15:10:00,SageSaga,?
21-12-2018T15:10:06,SageSaga,oh sorry- didnt see your message
21-12-2018T15:11:12,SageSaga,there's a lot of tutorials and video series talking about drawing but generally the best thing to do is to learn how to draw anatomy and then focus on style
21-12-2018T15:11:18,Sifty,"oh wow ok, I wasn't actually expecting sage to answer him/herself"
21-12-2018T15:11:48,SageSaga,sorry i cant actually say more- i gotta go right now - i'll be back real soon- gotta see if i can fix this PC for my brother in law
21-12-2018T15:11:56,FoxxTrotter,"OK, Sage."
21-12-2018T15:11:59,Sifty,ok thank you!
21-12-2018T15:12:08,FoxxTrotter,"Sage is a he, sifty. :0)"
21-12-2018T15:12:10,Hg17Lamont2002,Ello Sage
21-12-2018T15:12:20,Sifty,sage is a sage
21-12-2018T15:12:32,Hg17Lamont2002,Oof
21-12-2018T15:12:41,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, Hg. Sage will be back shortly."
21-12-2018T15:12:48,Hg17Lamont2002,I see
21-12-2018T15:14:10,Hg17Lamont2002,Thirsty ?
21-12-2018T15:14:30,Sifty,"but I mean, what about when you know how to do the anatomy? There are still a bunch of different ways i've seen people do this"
21-12-2018T15:15:06,Sifty,and twokinds's and sage's seem pretty similar
21-12-2018T15:15:11,FoxxTrotter,"Everyone has their own style of doing things, Sifty."
21-12-2018T15:15:24,FoxxTrotter,Yes...there can be similarities.
21-12-2018T15:16:56,Hg17Lamont2002,Tbh I see their art way different but maybe that‚Äôs just me
21-12-2018T15:18:01,FoxxTrotter,There are also some artists who went to school for this type of stuff and others who learned on their own.
21-12-2018T15:18:20,Sifty,"ok but if I WANT it to be like theirs, I just I dunno, try to emulate it while I learn or something?"
21-12-2018T15:18:35,Sifty,"sorry to be a bother with this, i'm a bit obsessed right now"
21-12-2018T15:18:59,Hg17Lamont2002,Lol
21-12-2018T15:20:03,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-sleepy: mornin
21-12-2018T15:20:11,FoxxTrotter,"E'lo, Bgr."
21-12-2018T15:20:14,Hg17Lamont2002,Morning
21-12-2018T15:21:49,Hg17Lamont2002,Bgr what is your time?
21-12-2018T15:22:43,Bgrmystr2,2:22pm
21-12-2018T15:23:05,Hg17Lamont2002,I see
21-12-2018T15:23:05,FoxxTrotter,"@Sifty Sage can probably can tell you more when he returns, but also keep in mind that he also needs to concentrate on his comic work."
21-12-2018T15:23:30,KapitanGroszek,Sifty do you have a problem with proportions?
21-12-2018T15:23:40,FoxxTrotter,I'm not an actual artist myself. I haven't drawn anything significant in over 20 years.
21-12-2018T15:23:49,FoxxTrotter,"Freehand, anyway."
21-12-2018T15:24:19,Sifty,"oh yes I know, I never actually expected the two to answer because they're busy"
21-12-2018T15:24:52,FoxxTrotter,"I've done drafting in the past, but that is a totally different concept of drawing."
21-12-2018T15:25:31,KapitanGroszek,Sifty maybe I will be able to help you
21-12-2018T15:26:55,Sifty,"and no kapitan it's more like, I'm worried if I go to the wrong place it'll lead me towards a style that isn't quite what what I like about this, or something"
21-12-2018T15:27:07,KapitanGroszek,But i have to know what is your problem?
21-12-2018T15:29:09,KapitanGroszek,I think you should to try everytking
21-12-2018T15:29:33,Sifty,I don't know how to say it in a way that makes sense
21-12-2018T15:31:00,Bgrmystr2,"you don't have to keep a style. Try other styles, try other designs"
21-12-2018T15:31:32,Sifty,"god I don't know, I just get these horrible nerves when I think about it, I'm just gonna go do that and maybe along the way it'll sort itself out"
21-12-2018T15:31:38,Sifty,thank you all
21-12-2018T15:31:52,FoxxTrotter,"C-ya, Sifty."
21-12-2018T15:31:54,KapitanGroszek,Sifty do not worry. I understand you because I have the same XD problem
21-12-2018T15:32:02,Sifty,cya? I'm not going anywhere
21-12-2018T15:32:11,FoxxTrotter,Oh...OK.
21-12-2018T15:32:17,Sifty,hello foxx
21-12-2018T15:33:01,KapitanGroszek,Ok i have to go. Good night
21-12-2018T15:33:10,FoxxTrotter,"G'night, Groszek."
21-12-2018T15:33:39,Sifty,goodnight

21-12-2018T15:34:26,Hg17Lamont2002,Hello sun
21-12-2018T15:34:32,KapitanGroszek,How did you know my name?!
21-12-2018T15:34:36,SageSaga,hes still testing stuff so i might be in and out till he is gone
21-12-2018T15:34:40,FoxxTrotter,Okies.
21-12-2018T15:36:05,Bgrmystr2,ohey sage
21-12-2018T15:36:08,Hg17Lamont2002,Man I have a habit of pausing the stream lol
21-12-2018T15:36:19,SageSaga,yo Bgr
21-12-2018T15:37:49,SageSaga,"@Sifty Normal human anatomy- realistic anatomy - is extremely important to learn early. Study it, draw it, draw weird poses with it- learn how they stretch and move"
21-12-2018T15:38:12,SageSaga,doing that will GREATLY improve your work when you simplify it to an anime like style
21-12-2018T15:39:08,Sifty,"i've heard that before, I guess there isn't really a secret to doing it the way you and twokinds do"
21-12-2018T15:39:21,Sifty,"i'll keep it in mind, thank you for taking the time to help me <3"
21-12-2018T15:39:33,FoxxTrotter,"Time, patience and practice. :0)"
21-12-2018T15:39:47,Bgrmystr2,why do you think there was some secret?
21-12-2018T15:40:09,SageSaga,As for just doing this style- it's not a secret- but blocking out anatomy is generally how all anime style work is done
21-12-2018T15:40:19,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. the ye old addage of the secret sauce.. is nothing.
21-12-2018T15:40:23,SageSaga,you then exaggerate proportions and features
21-12-2018T15:40:26,Sifty,I probably hold anime/manga artists in far higher regard than I should
21-12-2018T15:41:03,Sifty,"like ""all hail the gods of digital art"""
21-12-2018T15:41:12,SageSaga,I dont know many tutorial people on youtube but I do know MikeyMegaMega has some great stuff on drawing sexy girls...
21-12-2018T15:43:01,Hg17Lamont2002,Lol that eye roll of the guy üòÇ
21-12-2018T15:43:37,SageSaga,he cant help it- hes dead
21-12-2018T15:43:53,KapitanGroszek,;_;
21-12-2018T15:43:59,Hg17Lamont2002,@.@ lol
21-12-2018T15:44:09,KapitanGroszek,;-(
21-12-2018T15:46:06,Hg17Lamont2002,I paused the darn stream again üòÇ
21-12-2018T15:46:14,Hg17Lamont2002,I‚Äôm like why is nothing moving
21-12-2018T15:49:53,Hg17Lamont2002,So how is everyone this afternoon or night or morning for some lol
21-12-2018T15:50:22,FoxxTrotter,A nice day here today. It was wet and windy yesterday.
21-12-2018T15:50:47,Hg17Lamont2002,Same now it‚Äôs just chilly up here with a bit of cloufs
21-12-2018T16:07:33,SageSaga,back

21-12-2018T16:08:36,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:

21-12-2018T16:09:56,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-ohmy:
21-12-2018T16:11:23,SageSaga,i got a big box from China today
21-12-2018T16:11:35,SageSaga,they look really good!
21-12-2018T16:11:50,SageSaga,Detail is nice- colors went a little darker but thats normal for printing
21-12-2018T16:15:02,FoxxTrotter,:0)
21-12-2018T16:15:49,SageSaga,i'll have to see if Tom will help me promote them so they can sell faster so i can order more XD
21-12-2018T16:41:59,SageSaga,brb gonna check on my brother in law
21-12-2018T16:42:37,FoxxTrotter,Okies.

21-12-2018T16:56:23,SageSaga,well -figured out the PC problem
21-12-2018T16:59:00,CrimsonQuill,Hi all!
21-12-2018T16:59:08,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-victory::ptv-greetings:
21-12-2018T16:59:36,Bgrmystr2,what was it sage?
21-12-2018T17:01:45,SageSaga,CPU overheating
21-12-2018T17:02:34,SageSaga,"he was like ""Man its moving really slow now too"" and i was like ""That's not right"" and then it shut off- so then i did something you shouldnt do"
21-12-2018T17:02:44,SageSaga,i touched the cpu heat sink
21-12-2018T17:02:50,CrimsonQuill,Uh-Oh.
21-12-2018T17:02:50,SageSaga,it was cold.
21-12-2018T17:02:57,Bgrmystr2,aa
21-12-2018T17:03:08,Bgrmystr2,the heatsink wasn't seated properly
21-12-2018T17:03:16,SageSaga,"I was like ""Check the CPU temp"" and he turned it back on and i said ""OK! TURN IT OFF!"""
21-12-2018T17:03:40,SageSaga,it hit 92c and was climbing and windows wasnt even loaded yet
21-12-2018T17:03:59,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock::fire::fire::fire: christ
21-12-2018T17:04:25,SageSaga,"""Congrats, your PSU isnt bad- well it is bad- but it functions"""
21-12-2018T17:04:33,Bgrmystr2,haha
21-12-2018T17:04:38,CrimsonQuill,GOOD GRIEF
21-12-2018T17:05:56,SageSaga,the thermal paste was bad and it wasnt seated right
21-12-2018T17:06:28,CrimsonQuill,"So, is it fixed?"
21-12-2018T17:06:29,SageSaga,thermal paste was probably bad from the heat sink not being seated- there was a gap
21-12-2018T17:06:37,SageSaga,hes doing it now- im not doing it
21-12-2018T17:06:45,CrimsonQuill,That's good.
21-12-2018T17:06:59,Bgrmystr2,Wonder how much life he lost on his CPU from that.
21-12-2018T17:07:14,SageSaga,not much
21-12-2018T17:07:30,SageSaga,CPUs dont burn out that easily anymore- they shut down long before critical temps
21-12-2018T17:08:04,CrimsonQuill,I have no idea how these parts work...
21-12-2018T17:08:14,Bgrmystr2,so it wasn't at that temp for a long period of time? Cuz cpus still lose lifespan from higher temps even if they don't shut down
21-12-2018T17:09:19,SageSaga,CPU has to run at a very high temp for long periods of time for that kinda derogation
21-12-2018T17:10:13,SageSaga,"overclockers often run into issues like that because they run at much higher temps- this thing shuts off at 100c, it should be ok at 105c and 110-115 is where you see damage start"
21-12-2018T17:10:35,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's fair
21-12-2018T17:11:22,CrimsonQuill,"Are these the stairs that you have feared, Sage?"
21-12-2018T17:11:27,Bgrmystr2,yeah
21-12-2018T17:11:29,CrimsonQuill,Because they look rather good.
21-12-2018T17:11:31,Bgrmystr2,they are
21-12-2018T17:11:32,SageSaga,thanks
21-12-2018T17:11:38,Bgrmystr2,tis my thoughts too
21-12-2018T17:11:49,CrimsonQuill,I'm listening to Meglovania now...
21-12-2018T17:11:56,CrimsonQuill,I have Undertale on the brain.
21-12-2018T17:15:47,SageSaga,something happened to my fill settings
21-12-2018T17:15:57,SageSaga,theres a ton of unfilled areas around the lines
21-12-2018T17:16:24,CrimsonQuill,Oh dear
21-12-2018T17:17:00,CrimsonQuill,"I was trying to colour in my artwork yesterday (a pretty good one for myself, if I may say so) and the pencils kept snapping."
21-12-2018T17:17:19,CrimsonQuill,So I'll be buying myself some proper colouring pencils to use from now on.
21-12-2018T17:17:46,CrimsonQuill,Why did your fill tool bork out?
21-12-2018T17:18:14,SageSaga,i must have accidentally hit the slider with my hand- the only down side to a touch screen tablet
21-12-2018T17:18:42,CrimsonQuill,Oh.
21-12-2018T17:19:14,CrimsonQuill,"I probably wouldn't do well with a sketch tablet at all...I'm sticking to pencil and paper for the moment, till I can actually draw."
21-12-2018T17:19:33,CrimsonQuill,"Or rather, make consistentley good drawings."
21-12-2018T17:19:42,CrimsonQuill,My shading leaves much to be desired.
21-12-2018T17:25:04,SageSaga,i love touch tablets- i would hate to go back to a non-touch screen
21-12-2018T17:25:31,CrimsonQuill,"Well, we'd best hope that we have enough Neodynium."
21-12-2018T17:25:52,CrimsonQuill,"That's what's used in most touchscreens, and it's a fairly hard-to-come-by element."
21-12-2018T17:27:46,SageSaga,that said devices dont use a lot of it and im sure we have millions of tons of it in reserve already
21-12-2018T17:29:09,CrimsonQuill,"Well, as long as the old devices are correctly recycled, and the current stocks are carefully managed, I'm happy."
21-12-2018T17:33:19,Hg17Lamont2002,She‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI got you in my sight0^0‚Äù
21-12-2018T17:33:41,CrimsonQuill,It was at this moment he knew-
21-12-2018T17:34:06,Hg17Lamont2002,He f**ked up
21-12-2018T17:43:09,SageSaga,i love this brush
21-12-2018T17:43:48,Hg17Lamont2002,Yes a loyal brush
21-12-2018T17:44:04,SageSaga,"it's called - ""Woody Harrelson"""
21-12-2018T17:44:24,Hg17Lamont2002,Noice
21-12-2018T17:44:49,CrimsonQuill,The art is already there-the brush releases it from it's prison.
21-12-2018T17:45:13,Hg17Lamont2002,Exactly  *loved the way you worded it *
21-12-2018T17:46:20,SageSaga,i hate that saying
21-12-2018T17:46:58,CrimsonQuill,I got it from reading a book about Michelangelo.
21-12-2018T17:47:03,SageSaga,that was started by Michelangelo
21-12-2018T17:47:07,SageSaga,yep
21-12-2018T17:48:36,SageSaga,"""Oh- so you didnt make this at all?"" ""Err wait- what?"" ""Well you said it was in the stone- you just released it- so its a natural wonder not your work"" ""Wait no- that wasnt what i-"" ""Well thank goodness we dont pay for natural wonders"" ""Plz- stop"""
21-12-2018T17:49:01,CrimsonQuill,Ah. Now I see why you dislike it.
21-12-2018T17:49:10,CrimsonQuill,I take it back.
21-12-2018T17:49:21,Bgrmystr2,too late
21-12-2018T17:49:24,Bgrmystr2,can't take it back :P
21-12-2018T17:49:30,CrimsonQuill,It's never too late.
21-12-2018T17:49:32,SageSaga,the damage is already done XD
21-12-2018T17:49:39,Bgrmystr2,it's always too late
21-12-2018T17:49:47,Bgrmystr2,what you have typed cannot be untyped :v
21-12-2018T17:49:50,CrimsonQuill,I object.
21-12-2018T17:49:59,CrimsonQuill,I cannot untype it...
21-12-2018T17:50:16,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. you can try.
21-12-2018T17:50:19,CrimsonQuill,"But I take responsibility for it, apologise for it, and can learn from it."
21-12-2018T17:50:52,CrimsonQuill,"That's a skill I'm sorely in need of-moving on, as opposed to going OVER and OVER the same thing again and again."
21-12-2018T17:50:54,SageSaga,"""It's never too late!"" ""See this here? That's the due date, it's past that date."" ""Never give up!"" ""You failed, get out"""
21-12-2018T17:51:00,CrimsonQuill,LOL
21-12-2018T17:51:28,SageSaga,"""Believe it!"" ""SECURITY!"""
21-12-2018T17:52:36,CrimsonQuill,"""This is Connor-the Android sent by Cyberlife-I am removing the person now."""
21-12-2018T18:01:23,SageSaga,sometimes i wish English had cooler onamonapias
21-12-2018T18:02:19,Hg17Lamont2002,Tom decide not to stream today ? Surprised he‚Äôs still not on
21-12-2018T18:02:30,Bgrmystr2,He usually doesn't stream on Saturday
21-12-2018T18:02:33,Hg17Lamont2002,Probably family I would guess
21-12-2018T18:02:42,Bgrmystr2,"Friday and Sunday, like it says in the schedule"
21-12-2018T18:02:44,SageSaga,he was but he had a Christmas party to attend- that he forgot about
21-12-2018T18:02:45,Hg17Lamont2002,He needed to finish his comic page
21-12-2018T18:02:52,SageSaga,he did
21-12-2018T18:02:55,SageSaga,its up
21-12-2018T18:02:58,Bgrmystr2,"also, he has a family gathering for christmas"
21-12-2018T18:03:01,SageSaga,he just didnt stream it
21-12-2018T18:03:05,Hg17Lamont2002,I see
21-12-2018T18:03:32,CrimsonQuill,I hope Mark puts up a picture with all the family on his feeds.
21-12-2018T18:03:42,CrimsonQuill,And that Tom retweets it.
21-12-2018T18:04:27,SageSaga,"i need an onomatopoeia for ""Twist violently"""
21-12-2018T18:04:59,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
21-12-2018T18:05:12,Azumachan,Kweeep ?
21-12-2018T18:05:20,Bgrmystr2,wtf kinda sound is that lol
21-12-2018T18:05:28,Azumachan,"""Twist violently"""
21-12-2018T18:05:44,Bgrmystr2,"that's not how onomotopoeias work, bro lol"
21-12-2018T18:05:48,Azumachan,Or Twist in a deformed angry font
21-12-2018T18:06:19,CrimsonQuill,"'Scrontch' would probably be a more crushy sound, but would it work as twist?"
21-12-2018T18:06:26,CrimsonQuill,Nope-Wrence
21-12-2018T18:06:32,CrimsonQuill,Wrench
21-12-2018T18:06:46,CrimsonQuill,"So, a snapped neck? Nyna doesn't fool around."
21-12-2018T18:07:07,Bgrmystr2,"I was thinking of the one they use when the neck makes a whole bunch of cricks, then a crack"
21-12-2018T18:07:11,Azumachan,Shlerks ?
21-12-2018T18:07:12,Bgrmystr2,but I don't recall the sound effect for it
21-12-2018T18:07:52,CrimsonQuill,This just makes me think back to the Twokinds chapter 'Mutiny'...
21-12-2018T18:08:13,CrimsonQuill,"Natani:'Ok, snap neck at third vertabrae'."
21-12-2018T18:09:03,SageSaga,Nyna did just murder 2 people in the last comic- of course its not gonna stop there
21-12-2018T18:09:34,CrimsonQuill,'Murder'? Surely it was self defence?
21-12-2018T18:09:40,Bgrmystr2,uh..
21-12-2018T18:09:43,Bgrmystr2,no
21-12-2018T18:09:50,CrimsonQuill,Pre-emptive self defence.
21-12-2018T18:10:02,Bgrmystr2,that's not how self-defense works
21-12-2018T18:10:10,Bgrmystr2,she ambushed them
21-12-2018T18:10:13,CrimsonQuill,"Or rather, the injuries WERE self-inflicted."
21-12-2018T18:10:20,CrimsonQuill,"As in, they speared themselves."
21-12-2018T18:10:22,SageSaga,actually they did try to kill her first
21-12-2018T18:10:26,CrimsonQuill,With a little help.
21-12-2018T18:10:33,SageSaga,they tried to ambush her
21-12-2018T18:10:41,CrimsonQuill,I;m using Anhk Morpork City Watch logic.
21-12-2018T18:10:44,Bgrmystr2,and thus she kicked the door down
21-12-2018T18:10:50,Bgrmystr2,"your logic has no power here, Quill"
21-12-2018T18:11:03,SageSaga,she was breaking and entering XD
21-12-2018T18:11:08,CrimsonQuill,Works well against a half-crazy crook trying to kill you with a broken bottle down Gleam Street.
21-12-2018T18:11:31,CrimsonQuill,Terry Pratchett's humour comes from loopholes...
21-12-2018T18:12:00,CrimsonQuill,This on the other hand...this is a military operation.
21-12-2018T18:12:08,CrimsonQuill,I hereby classify Nyna as a soldier.
21-12-2018T18:12:12,CrimsonQuill,"Thus, it is war."
21-12-2018T18:12:24,CrimsonQuill,"But then again, war itself is a crime."
21-12-2018T18:12:42,CrimsonQuill,THUMP
21-12-2018T18:12:44,CrimsonQuill,THUMO
21-12-2018T18:12:46,CrimsonQuill,THUMPO
21-12-2018T18:12:49,CrimsonQuill,THUMP
21-12-2018T18:16:35,SageSaga,"guy breaks into your home- declares war, murders everyone legally? Im seeing an issue here"
21-12-2018T18:17:21,Bgrmystr2,yeah. the guy clearly needed to knock before kicking the door down.
21-12-2018T18:17:24,SageSaga,"""Officer- he came in and yelled ""War!"" so I-"" ""Wait- he declared war? Sorry we cant help you. Legal rights"""
21-12-2018T18:17:29,Bgrmystr2,just so the door could hit someone as they're going to answer it.
21-12-2018T18:18:15,CrimsonQuill,"Sam Vimes: 'Sir, I am placing you under arrest for conspiracy to make affray, and conspiracy to disturb the peace'."
21-12-2018T18:18:16,SageSaga,brb
21-12-2018T18:18:21,CrimsonQuill,"Ah, Discworld"
21-12-2018T18:18:27,CrimsonQuill,Ok Sage
21-12-2018T18:18:39,KapitanGroszek,"Can I still buy a ,,two kinds dragon masquerade''?"
21-12-2018T18:19:05,FoxxTrotter,Yes you can. I can't remember where at the moment.
21-12-2018T18:19:49,KapitanGroszek,I need to know where i can get it
21-12-2018T18:20:09,Bgrmystr2,You can get the digital version by putting just $1 on tom's patreon https://www.patreon.com/twokinds
21-12-2018T18:20:29,Bgrmystr2,you also get access to the other comics he has uploaded
21-12-2018T18:21:05,Bgrmystr2,I don't know about the physical edition though
21-12-2018T18:21:09,FoxxTrotter,IndyPlanet sells a printed version if you'd like to go that route.
21-12-2018T18:21:11,Bgrmystr2,I know he sells them at conventions
21-12-2018T18:21:16,Bgrmystr2,"ah, there you go"
21-12-2018T18:21:34,SageSaga,back
21-12-2018T18:21:37,FoxxTrotter,"As for Prank Pixie Panic, I've only seen that in PDF."
21-12-2018T18:21:53,Bgrmystr2,Tom sells that at cons
21-12-2018T18:21:54,CrimsonQuill,WB
21-12-2018T18:23:54,FoxxTrotter,"OK, I wasn't sure if Tom still had hard copies of that one. I know Hayate has been wanting to get PPP in print for awhile now."
21-12-2018T18:24:43,Bgrmystr2,"every time I see images of tom's table at cons, I almost always see PPP there"
21-12-2018T18:24:54,FoxxTrotter,Okies.
21-12-2018T18:25:47,CrimsonQuill,I want to meet Tom there.
21-12-2018T18:25:53,CrimsonQuill,"But, prices, prices..."
21-12-2018T18:26:06,SageSaga,oh he got confirmed for Anthrocon
21-12-2018T18:26:12,SageSaga,so we will be there together
21-12-2018T18:26:16,FoxxTrotter,Kewlness.
21-12-2018T18:26:24,CrimsonQuill,Great for you!
21-12-2018T18:26:28,FoxxTrotter,"Pittsburgh is a bit of a trip for me, though."
21-12-2018T18:26:55,FoxxTrotter,I'll probably see w0lfmare sometime next year. He plans on attending a couple conventions in Virginia.
21-12-2018T18:26:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I need to go to a con
21-12-2018T18:27:03,CrimsonQuill,I'm about 4000 kilometers away even from Pittsburgh.
21-12-2018T18:27:21,CrimsonQuill,I don't know if I could go to something like Anthrocon...
21-12-2018T18:27:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt have a vacation planned for this year yet
21-12-2018T18:27:38,SpazztasticKiwi,What was the con in Georgia again?
21-12-2018T18:27:38,CrimsonQuill,I'm going to be spending my summer working.
21-12-2018T18:27:39,SageSaga,im nervous about going to a Furry con myself
21-12-2018T18:27:50,SageSaga,the con in Atlanta was Momocon
21-12-2018T18:28:03,FoxxTrotter,"We have ACE coming up here next month, but I'll most likely not attend."
21-12-2018T18:28:06,CrimsonQuill,Where's Atlanta-East or West US?
21-12-2018T18:28:07,FoxxTrotter,That is in Cary.
21-12-2018T18:28:08,SageSaga,im pretty sure there are furries out there that want to stab me
21-12-2018T18:28:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Momo ok
21-12-2018T18:28:15,SageSaga,Atlanta is East Coast USA
21-12-2018T18:28:17,FoxxTrotter,Atlanta is in Georgia.
21-12-2018T18:28:18,Bgrmystr2,East yeah
21-12-2018T18:28:18,CrimsonQuill,Ok
21-12-2018T18:28:28,SageSaga,its not on the coast but the state is
21-12-2018T18:28:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Buddy there‚Äôs people out there that‚Äôll stab you for breathing‚Äôs
21-12-2018T18:28:47,CrimsonQuill,I have a videofriend I made on Deviantart who lives about Pittsburgh.
21-12-2018T18:28:50,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, if you're across the ocean, then east or west won't make much of a difference based on the sheer distance you'd be flying"
21-12-2018T18:28:51,CrimsonQuill,He makes Lego.
21-12-2018T18:29:03,SageSaga,yeah but i can see their stabbingness in their eyes- cant see it in the eyes of a fur suit
21-12-2018T18:29:06,CrimsonQuill,Or the AEROPLANE NOISE.
21-12-2018T18:29:39,Bgrmystr2,yes airplanes make airplane noises. Thanks capt obvious
21-12-2018T18:29:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Just keep some security around your booth and a reasonable distance from visitors
21-12-2018T18:29:46,SageSaga,just a big ol dumb dog smiling at me as he drives a screw driver into my neck
21-12-2018T18:29:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Paranoid much?
21-12-2018T18:30:04,Bgrmystr2,just a lil
21-12-2018T18:30:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Just go with Tom to Momocon and hide behind him
21-12-2018T18:30:34,CrimsonQuill,@Brgmystr2 I only had my first ever aeroplane flight about a month and a half ago.
21-12-2018T18:30:36,SageSaga,hey - people hate me for being friends with Tom- it's very unsettling to know they hide  behind masks
21-12-2018T18:30:57,Azumachan,Some people can be crazy
21-12-2018T18:30:59,CrimsonQuill,@SageSaga nothing wrong with being friends with Tom.
21-12-2018T18:30:59,FoxxTrotter,I haven't flown in a plane in the past few years now.
21-12-2018T18:31:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Why on earth do they hate you for being frinds with him?
21-12-2018T18:31:04,SpazztasticKiwi,friends
21-12-2018T18:31:10,Bgrmystr2,"s'okay sage, you don't gotta worry bout me. If I meet you, I'll tell you I am who I am :v"
21-12-2018T18:31:12,CrimsonQuill,@SpazztasticKiwi because People.
21-12-2018T18:31:12,FoxxTrotter,"Prop jets are noisy as hell, yes. XP"
21-12-2018T18:31:26,SageSaga,some people think that if i wasnt his friend then THEY could be his friend
21-12-2018T18:31:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Yes
21-12-2018T18:31:39,CrimsonQuill,Like that'd happen.
21-12-2018T18:31:44,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs how friendships work
21-12-2018T18:31:49,Azumachan,People hate what they can't have.
21-12-2018T18:31:50,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs a quota to fill
21-12-2018T18:31:51,Bgrmystr2,Because you can only have ONE FRIEND EVER :ptv-pouty:
21-12-2018T18:31:51,SageSaga,they dont understand social relationships
21-12-2018T18:32:01,SpazztasticKiwi,And only a limited number of spots
21-12-2018T18:32:03,CrimsonQuill,Friendship works by being nice and sharing interests.
21-12-2018T18:32:05,SageSaga,its why they scare me
21-12-2018T18:32:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Gotta grab em fast
21-12-2018T18:32:21,SageSaga,people who think like that are clearly broken and broken people stab people sometimes!
21-12-2018T18:32:54,Azumachan,You can ask the security team at the event to limit the risk ?
21-12-2018T18:32:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Well if your a complete fruit loop friendship with your favorite artist is out of the question anyway
21-12-2018T18:33:13,SageSaga,doesnt stop them from trying
21-12-2018T18:33:15,SpazztasticKiwi,you‚Äôre
21-12-2018T18:33:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Just don‚Äôt eat food gifts and keep security around
21-12-2018T18:33:46,Azumachan,"I don't know what to say, keep a pepper spray ?"
21-12-2018T18:34:00,SpazztasticKiwi,And a good three foot radius distance
21-12-2018T18:34:12,CrimsonQuill,I doubt that I'd qualify as a friend to either you or Tom-all I am at the moment is someone typing things at 11:35pm.
21-12-2018T18:36:14,SageSaga,ive gotten chat logs sent to me from private conversations
21-12-2018T18:36:29,CrimsonQuill,What does that mean?
21-12-2018T18:36:31,SageSaga,"they generally go like ""Uhg, that guy. I hate Sage. He's too close to Tom"""
21-12-2018T18:36:53,Azumachan,That's the internet.
21-12-2018T18:37:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe it‚Äôs a case of ‚Äúthey shouldn‚Äôt be they close if they‚Äôre straight‚Äù line of thinking
21-12-2018T18:38:05,CrimsonQuill,The internet...
21-12-2018T18:38:23,SageSaga,considering its usually a mix of them saying im in their way or they hate that I can just talk to Tom like a normal person... I dont think thats it Spazz
21-12-2018T18:38:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Jealousy thinking
21-12-2018T18:38:58,Azumachan,"You have to be aware of the slim risk, but i don't think it's something to be concern about."
21-12-2018T18:39:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I guess it doesn‚Äôt matter if they‚Äôre acting like a crack pot generator
21-12-2018T18:39:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Sorry I even brought that idea up
21-12-2018T18:39:30,Bgrmystr2,it's only jealousy if they want something sage has fairly.
21-12-2018T18:39:54,CrimsonQuill,"Personally, I don't mind."
21-12-2018T18:40:16,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, I'd just be happy to meet you too, and have a quick chat-maybe get a few sketches."
21-12-2018T18:41:24,Azumachan,I'm sure AC have a pretty tight security too.
21-12-2018T18:41:24,SageSaga,"it doesnt bother me much while online because the safety of distance- i havent met one yet where im like ""They might actually try to find me and kill me"" but at a con its like ""He came to me- now's my chance!"""
21-12-2018T18:41:25,sunblaze,ok I am close to fainting. better get some sleep
21-12-2018T18:41:27,sunblaze,ciao

21-12-2018T18:42:40,Bgrmystr2,meh :v
21-12-2018T18:43:39,SpazztasticKiwi,You know though. If it‚Äôs an issue that they don‚Äôt like you cause they find how easily you can talk with him the problem
21-12-2018T18:43:58,SpazztasticKiwi,...have they tried? Cause it‚Äôs pretty simple to start a conversation
21-12-2018T18:44:06,Azumachan,"I'm sure Tom had his fair share of it, i think you can ask him for advises."
21-12-2018T18:44:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Voila - you talked to him
21-12-2018T18:44:36,Bgrmystr2,advice* Azuma
21-12-2018T18:44:49,Bgrmystr2,and yeah you can just.. go to the stream chat and.. you know.. talk to the guy?
21-12-2018T18:44:52,Bgrmystr2,he hangs around
21-12-2018T18:44:55,Azumachan,advices* My bad.
21-12-2018T18:45:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm sure Tom‚Äôs got some con horror stories too
21-12-2018T18:45:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe you can hit mom up for some. Lessen some worries
21-12-2018T18:45:18,Bgrmystr2,"it doesn't need an s, it doesn't have a plural."
21-12-2018T18:45:20,SpazztasticKiwi,him
21-12-2018T18:45:45,Bgrmystr2,most anyone in tom's shoes has horror stories
21-12-2018T18:45:52,Bgrmystr2,hell.. anyone on the net for long enough will have em
21-12-2018T18:46:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I still find some that mark tells rather disturbing
21-12-2018T18:46:24,CrimsonQuill,Maybe I should warn my sister. She plans to upload her own webcomic soon...
21-12-2018T18:46:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Like the one where a fan just walked up and touched his face
21-12-2018T18:46:44,CrimsonQuill,"OKAY, THAT IS JUST WRONG."
21-12-2018T18:47:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I would‚Äôve had to slap somebody
21-12-2018T18:48:15,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. ask first
21-12-2018T18:48:24,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-unimpressed:
21-12-2018T18:51:27,SpazztasticKiwi,No he wouldn‚Äôt liked it even if they asked. It‚Äôs known Mark doesn‚Äôt like his face  - or anything shoulders up - touched
21-12-2018T18:52:02,Bgrmystr2,"Still, generally ask first, and if he says no then no :U"
21-12-2018T18:54:33,SpazztasticKiwi,And honestly. You don‚Äôt just ‚Äúcan I touch you‚Äù to someone even if you‚Äôre a fan
21-12-2018T18:54:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm in the same boat he was. No touchie the face-y
21-12-2018T18:55:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Or me in general. Elbow room
21-12-2018T18:57:03,Bgrmystr2,"bah, I'd prolly give all the artists I like big hugs, but other than that.. just shoot the shit and maybe buy somethin if I have the cash"
21-12-2018T18:57:25,CrimsonQuill,I want to ask Tom for an art trade.
21-12-2018T18:57:49,CrimsonQuill,"When I've finished that Subnautica fanart, I think it'd be nice to give it to him."
21-12-2018T18:57:50,Azumachan,I don't think he does that anymore.
21-12-2018T18:57:57,CrimsonQuill,Oh.
21-12-2018T18:58:05,CrimsonQuill,"Still, I could give it anyway..."
21-12-2018T18:58:22,Azumachan,you can sent via email the fanart.
21-12-2018T18:58:25,CrimsonQuill,"Maybe make 3 copies and send one to Tom, one to Mark, and one to Jack."
21-12-2018T18:58:32,CrimsonQuill,It isn't TK fanart.
21-12-2018T18:58:37,CrimsonQuill,I wouldn't do that.
21-12-2018T18:58:44,CrimsonQuill,I'd muck up the art style.
21-12-2018T18:59:06,CrimsonQuill,"My best friend, who suggested the comic to me, advised me to 'Stay away from the fanart'"
21-12-2018T18:59:20,SpazztasticKiwi,The only people who have my art I did for them is Se√°n and his brother
21-12-2018T18:59:28,CrimsonQuill,"Oooh, I like the shadow around Nyna's face."
21-12-2018T18:59:36,CrimsonQuill,I have a Jumbo Septiceye Sam on my chair.
21-12-2018T18:59:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Everyone else is just thrown up on Twitter and tagged
21-12-2018T19:00:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Mal is actually the only one to have noticed his since Jack and Ethan have such an insane fandom
21-12-2018T19:00:25,CrimsonQuill,My sister and I loved Sean's reaction to the 'Pundertale' T-shirt a fan sent him.
21-12-2018T19:00:40,CrimsonQuill,Fandoms...
21-12-2018T19:00:44,CrimsonQuill,It is now midnight.

21-12-2018T19:02:13,CrimsonQuill,And try not to think about how late I'll be up tomorrow...
21-12-2018T19:02:29,CrimsonQuill,"After all, I have to get up early at a reasonable hour for Mass."

21-12-2018T19:12:15,Bgrmystr2,I got biscuits with butter and jelly. :ptv-hearts:
21-12-2018T19:16:35,Nekora,"Huh, only 18 watchers, thought there would be more."

21-12-2018T19:18:43,Nekora,"heh, guys not dead, just trying to not look up her kimono."
21-12-2018T19:19:20,FoxxTrotter,My biscuits just got ruined and I had to toss them. One of the cats jumped on the counter and knocked them onto the floor upside-down.
21-12-2018T19:19:35,FoxxTrotter,"Still have the chicken strips and fries, though."
21-12-2018T19:19:58,Nekora,"ah, cats. if they are not happy why should anyone else be"
21-12-2018T19:20:25,FoxxTrotter,"Yeah, they are still murdering the Christmas tree as well (not literally). XP"
21-12-2018T19:21:08,Nekora,"no baubles are safe. Thank god we have high quality plastics instead of glass baubles, am i right?"
21-12-2018T19:22:10,FoxxTrotter,We've only had one broken ornament so far...and a candy cane. The others we just put back up higher.
21-12-2018T19:23:05,FoxxTrotter,It's usually two of our eight cats we have to worry about regarding such stuff.
21-12-2018T19:24:05,SageSaga,almost done
21-12-2018T19:24:34,FoxxTrotter,"E'lo, Mihari. :0)"

21-12-2018T20:15:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Someone just called deli earlier to ask if we (Walmart)have perfume (Channel NO 5)
21-12-2018T20:16:18,Bgrmystr2,no. Walmart does not have perfume.
21-12-2018T20:17:21,ZephyrTWolffox,hewwo

21-12-2018T20:19:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Not unless you want to smell like fried chicken
21-12-2018T20:20:40,ZephyrTWolffox,maybe he really does want to smell like noms :\
21-12-2018T20:21:07,SpazztasticKiwi,But he asked for the channel no 5
21-12-2018T20:24:08,SpazztasticKiwi,He wanted something ‚Äúyoung‚Äù for this lady he lived with. And apparently he sees Channel alot everywhere so he decided on that
21-12-2018T20:25:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I dunno. It‚Äôs a good thing I got it though I helped enough that he‚Äôs got a plan now
21-12-2018T20:37:01,Bgrmystr2,He plans to smell like fried chicken
21-12-2018T20:37:09,Bgrmystr2,the BEST thing to impress a girl.

21-12-2018T20:46:31,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs milk chocolate instead of white?
21-12-2018T20:46:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I dunno
21-12-2018T20:47:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I got it - it‚Äôs dark to think of nibbling on your man

21-12-2018T20:52:47,Bgrmystr2,fangs for what though..?
