13-11-2018T00:02:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah that was a special video
13-11-2018T00:02:23,SpazztasticKiwi,that I didn‚Äôt need in my life
13-11-2018T00:03:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Don‚Äôt forget the eggnog bath. Or the hot chocolatie bath
13-11-2018T00:03:59,SpazztasticKiwi,*mashed potato bath
13-11-2018T00:04:05,Ordithus,Coffee bath?
13-11-2018T00:04:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Don‚Äôt encourage him
13-11-2018T00:04:22,Ordithus,Treasure bath? :ptv-excited:
13-11-2018T00:04:37,Mippy,:ptv-laugh:
13-11-2018T00:05:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm waiting for him to find the person willing to taze him
13-11-2018T00:05:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Because apparently he wants to know how that feels
13-11-2018T00:05:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Spoiler: it hurts
13-11-2018T00:05:32,Ordithus,"I expect so, yeah.  Badly"
13-11-2018T00:05:50,Dadrobit,Can confirm. Weird kind of pain. Like a full body cramp.
13-11-2018T00:07:10,Mippy,Rub a dub dub! Three men in a tub...of hot chocolate
13-11-2018T00:07:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"I mean I got a stun gun, as you know. And the urge to touch the shiny light is there. But I also have sense"
13-11-2018T00:07:39,Ordithus,Curiosity is a strange thing
13-11-2018T00:09:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I do have pepper spray though if he wants to try that. It‚Äôs not x amount of volts going through your body
13-11-2018T00:09:58,SpazztasticKiwi,And that‚Äôs another thing: he wants to be pepper sprayed
13-11-2018T00:10:04,Ordithus,:ptv-nope:
13-11-2018T00:10:23,SpazztasticKiwi,So maybe not give him ideas
13-11-2018T00:10:24,Ordithus,I can attest that being stabbed feels roughly like being poked.  Then the pain hits.
13-11-2018T00:12:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I believe he‚Äôs had his fill on being stabbed. He had a surgery in 2011ish that carries quite the story
13-11-2018T00:12:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Though no he wasn‚Äôt actually stabbed
13-11-2018T00:14:37,Mippy,"Nearly choked laughing at Mark, Ethan, and Tyler dancing in the shower. Thta video has been a winter tradition since 2016."
13-11-2018T00:15:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"It‚Äôd be nice if he came down around here for some videos. Maybe not ‚Äúlet‚Äôs try pepper spray‚Äù, but something"
13-11-2018T00:15:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Unfortunately we don‚Äôt have much to do around here except the park. It has an old retired tank an train engine
13-11-2018T00:16:14,Mippy,"Hey, if I ever found myself in Cali and he provided the spray, I'd be more than happy to help him out"
13-11-2018T00:16:54,SpazztasticKiwi,You‚Äôd spray Mark
13-11-2018T00:17:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"Personally, I‚Äôd see if he had a family member that would or could do it instead"
13-11-2018T00:17:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"That way instead of calling the cops if he gets mad, he just calls mom"
13-11-2018T00:18:02,Mippy,I mean...if he put out a call for people. You know...asked.
13-11-2018T00:18:11,Ordithus,Would Tom pepper spray his own little brother? :ctwokinds-floraquestion:
13-11-2018T00:18:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Ah but tom doesn‚Äôt like being on camera
13-11-2018T00:19:00,Mippy,Korean Candy..exceeption to the rule?
13-11-2018T00:19:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Quick cameo. A nice one. And mark was doing most of the showmanship
13-11-2018T00:19:58,SpazztasticKiwi,And yeah I know he‚Äôs literally asking for it for the experience but I do have a wee bit of a conscience
13-11-2018T00:21:17,Mippy,Kiwi is a good sort
13-11-2018T00:21:33,Mippy,:ctwokinds-rainehappy:
13-11-2018T00:22:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"Who knows if he‚Äôll ever do it. And I‚Äôm not entirely sure he‚Äôs film a whole bunch of it since it‚Äôs a rather questionable idea, but hopefully he gets a professional"
13-11-2018T00:22:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Like a cop
13-11-2018T00:23:19,SpazztasticKiwi,90% of injuries from a tazing is from the fall
13-11-2018T00:23:28,Mippy,"XD Yeah, that would probuby be for the best."
13-11-2018T00:23:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Or something like 90%
13-11-2018T00:24:13,Mippy,woulden't know. the public owning tazers is not exactly common here
13-11-2018T00:25:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Ive seen that ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù tasers (with the barbs) are for Licensed professionals like cops
13-11-2018T00:25:46,SpazztasticKiwi,As they have a...potency. And the barbs. But stun guns are generally publicly owned
13-11-2018T00:26:02,SpazztasticKiwi,And may be the only kind of thing he could try
13-11-2018T00:26:40,Mippy,....In fact...I think they are considerd a prohibited firearm.
13-11-2018T00:26:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Might depend on the state
13-11-2018T00:26:56,Mippy,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:

13-11-2018T00:39:34,unsteddyphoenix,Is the picture an accurate representation too?
13-11-2018T00:40:09,Mippy,I get enough American TV to have heard a variety of American accents
13-11-2018T00:40:53,SpazztasticKiwi,You think I would look like that

13-11-2018T00:41:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Think carefully of your answer

13-11-2018T00:46:03,Twokinds,lol I called Colin a puppy and I think someone took it literally.

13-11-2018T00:46:42,Ordithus,He's a pupper at heart <3
13-11-2018T00:46:44,Twokinds,"And, you know, the juxtoposition of his being enormous."

13-11-2018T15:08:26,Vatruvius,That does not surprise me. I am having a hell of a time converting my webcomic into just one sentence. At the very least this process so far has helped me decide which of my two main characters is the protagonist.
13-11-2018T15:09:16,Vatruvius,"This, in turn, has shifted the focus of my webcomic so things are moving. Just not nearly as much as I would like."
13-11-2018T15:11:37,TerraTheWizard,"just write a descriptive paragraph the change all the periods to commas, problem solved :ctwokinds-smug:"
13-11-2018T15:13:08,Vatruvius,"Well I already got that but it is a little hard to pull the theme I subconsciously put into my webcomic from a paragraph. With a sentence the theme stands out, plus it makes a great intro into what the comic is about without giving anything away."

13-11-2018T15:32:43,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been 84 years...‚Äù üëµ
13-11-2018T15:33:43,Vatruvius,I don't think it has been quite that long...
13-11-2018T15:34:21,Xexanoth,colin is best pillow :)
13-11-2018T15:35:14,Vatruvius,I do not doubt it...I trust Sam's judgement.
13-11-2018T15:38:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I could use a fluffy Colin
13-11-2018T15:38:04,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs cold
13-11-2018T15:38:56,Vatruvius,It is cold here too...broke out the sweats in what seems like a year.
13-11-2018T15:41:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"I go in today. Not for long, but I don‚Äôt feel like pants"
13-11-2018T15:41:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"And again, it‚Äôs cold"
13-11-2018T15:42:39,Vatruvius,"Well, Christmas is coming..."
13-11-2018T15:44:11,SpazztasticKiwi,And thanksgiving
13-11-2018T15:44:17,SpazztasticKiwi,And Black Friday
13-11-2018T15:45:09,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-katdryer:
13-11-2018T15:45:13,Vatruvius,Yup...getting my drawing monitor on Black Firday/Tech Monday. Whichever has a huge sale tagged on it.
13-11-2018T15:46:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve seen a computer screen on sale at a nearby Walmart on sale at $350
13-11-2018T15:46:56,SpazztasticKiwi,And that‚Äôs a discount
13-11-2018T15:48:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"It‚Äôs a wonder what is was, and why it was marked down, but it looked nice. May‚Äòve been the box was dented. Couldn‚Äôt see a brand name anywhere tho"
13-11-2018T15:48:54,TerraTheWizard,do you still have the scummy black friday price stuff where discounts are actually more expensive than the rest of the year?
13-11-2018T15:49:26,TerraTheWizard,because they wanted to do that over here but it's illegal
13-11-2018T15:49:27,TerraTheWizard,lol
13-11-2018T15:50:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve never looked to notice
13-11-2018T15:51:03,Vatruvius,"Typically leading up to Black Friday prices are increased so that the sales seem like a bargain, when really you are paying the same price minus a few dollars."
13-11-2018T15:51:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve seen most prices put up and the only reason the thing becomes so in demand is the limited amount
13-11-2018T15:51:40,Vatruvius,Depends on the brand and where you are buying from. But smart buyers always save a decent buck.
13-11-2018T15:52:01,TerraTheWizard,"like, black friday shouldn't even be a thing over here because we don't have a thanksgiving"
13-11-2018T15:52:06,TerraTheWizard,but stores like money so
13-11-2018T15:52:21,TerraTheWizard,"they tried it once, then the next year no-one cared"
13-11-2018T15:52:29,TerraTheWizard,because the best deals are like 5% of a potato peeler
13-11-2018T15:52:41,TerraTheWizard,*off
13-11-2018T15:52:50,Vatruvius,lol
13-11-2018T15:53:25,Vatruvius,Good thing not having Black Friday because multiple people actually die trying to buy stuff physically in a store. Just don't do it.
13-11-2018T15:53:44,TerraTheWizard,"yeah, the first year they did it there were riots"
13-11-2018T15:54:17,TerraTheWizard,"then people realised the deals were terrible ""compared to the US"" (lol)"
13-11-2018T15:55:17,TerraTheWizard,"the whole issue was because of Asda, they got bought by WalMart"
13-11-2018T15:55:32,TerraTheWizard,"so walmart decided ""brits need deals on that day that america has"""
13-11-2018T15:55:45,Vatruvius,Huh...
13-11-2018T15:56:13,TerraTheWizard,"so we had news about ""black friday riots at asda"""
13-11-2018T15:56:25,TerraTheWizard,"& half of the country was like ""wtf is black friday"""
13-11-2018T15:56:41,Vatruvius,"A lot of stuff on Black Friday is just clever marketing. Limited timed deals, like 1 hour or 15 minutes, make buyers act impulsively without thinking."
13-11-2018T15:57:24,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs for the gullible
13-11-2018T15:57:36,Vatruvius,"In my opinion, the deals are not worth it. Tech Monday became a thing because all the smart buyers would just buy online. So real sales with real saving started to happen."
13-11-2018T15:58:28,TerraTheWizard,back sooooooon :ctwokinds-katdryer:
13-11-2018T15:58:41,Vatruvius,That is what I am hopping for. My drawing monitor is already 10%-15% off on Amazon and I am just hoping Amaze applies a larger sale on Tech Monday.

13-11-2018T16:20:34,Bgrmystr2,@Vatruvius it's called Cyber Monday btw
13-11-2018T16:20:44,Vatruvius,*derp*
13-11-2018T16:22:44,Vatruvius,"Why on Earth did I think it was called ""tech"" Monday?"
13-11-2018T16:22:47,Vatruvius,I do not know...
13-11-2018T16:26:32,Bgrmystr2,"well, they sell tech stuff for the most part"
13-11-2018T16:26:43,Bgrmystr2,lot of computer hardware sales
13-11-2018T16:26:54,Bgrmystr2,so it's understandable lol
13-11-2018T16:27:40,Vatruvius,"I get that much, but I know it is called ""Cyber"" Monday. I even talked about it before. For some reason my brain just used ""Tech"" this time around."
13-11-2018T16:33:17,Twokinds,Just another way to get people to waste money
13-11-2018T16:35:11,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, there are actually some good deals on sites like newegg"
13-11-2018T16:35:18,Bgrmystr2,which doesn't raise prices before the sale
13-11-2018T16:37:20,Vatruvius,"Exactly. And I am not one to buy a lot of things with a sale on it unless I know it is an actual sale. Other than video games, I know for sure the drawing monitor I am looking for is on sale right now and am just hoping for a bit larger sale."
13-11-2018T16:38:21,Bgrmystr2,"my problem is that 99% of the things on sale on sites like newegg that actually have proper sales instead of just money-making ""sales"" is that they don't sell anything of quality that you'd actually want to buy"
13-11-2018T16:38:37,Bgrmystr2,it's always the average or below average stuff that has 50/50 reviews or whatnot
13-11-2018T16:38:51,Bgrmystr2,or just low quality items made with cheap materials
13-11-2018T16:39:38,Vatruvius,"Yeah...that is the unfortunate side of sales this time of year. It is a pain in the ass to find something of quality that is also on sale. But when you do, it is worth it in the end."
13-11-2018T16:39:41,Bgrmystr2,they put stuff on sale that noone was going to buy ANYWAY
13-11-2018T16:39:54,Bgrmystr2,"and when it goes on sale, all the derps are like OMGBBQ SALER!@*#!"
13-11-2018T16:39:55,Vatruvius,Just trying to clear shelf space...
13-11-2018T16:40:33,Bgrmystr2,"tis why I don't bother. if I wouldn't buy it not on sale, I usually don't buy it on sale either"
13-11-2018T16:41:08,Bgrmystr2,"those sales are for people who look for low prices, not good products"
13-11-2018T16:41:14,Bgrmystr2,"I look for products, not prices."
13-11-2018T16:41:15,Twokinds,That's why I always suggest using one of those plug-ins that tell you what the price has been over the last year
13-11-2018T16:41:18,Vatruvius,True.
13-11-2018T16:41:27,Bgrmystr2,there are plugins for that? :O
13-11-2018T16:41:30,Twokinds,"So you know if they didn't just put it on ""sale"" for what it normally is"
13-11-2018T16:41:48,Twokinds,Yeah
13-11-2018T16:42:00,Bgrmystr2,interesting
13-11-2018T16:42:15,Twokinds,"There's two I know of, camelcamelcamel and... I can't remember the other one. Honey something"

13-11-2018T16:43:06,Vatruvius,"I heard of Honey, a lot of ads for the coupons they can get you."
13-11-2018T16:43:16,Twokinds,Honey also looks around and tries to apply every coupon code it can find.
13-11-2018T16:43:23,Vatruvius,"I already had this drawing monitor picked out, so I am just looking for good deals."
13-11-2018T16:43:31,Twokinds,"Honestly, I don't find it too useful. It usually doesn't find anything in my experience."
13-11-2018T16:43:43,Twokinds,But it's nice for looking up price history.
13-11-2018T16:43:55,Vatruvius,"That is not what the ads say Tom, you must be mistaken. XD"

13-11-2018T16:54:56,Vatruvius,"But basic D&D V4, is it V4 :thinking:, it weighs nothing. Now I have to double check...but I am too lazy to do so."

13-11-2018T17:01:37,Vatruvius,DMing is not that bad of a thing. Most likely I will be bringing friends new to D&D in so I will DM with my whopping .5 games played on a different edition no less.
13-11-2018T17:01:40,Vatruvius,Should be fun.
13-11-2018T17:02:02,Bgrmystr2,I'm not big on playing because I'm not going to remember most minute things

13-11-2018T17:02:17,Vatruvius,I was skeptical of D&D when I first played it but not anymore. Absolutely worth it.

13-11-2018T17:08:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm behind with the RDR2 series
13-11-2018T17:08:29,SpazztasticKiwi,And Deltarune
13-11-2018T17:09:32,CrimsonQuill,I'm behind on Undertale. Undyne keeps killing me.
13-11-2018T17:09:42,CrimsonQuill,I'm trying not to kill anyone.
13-11-2018T17:09:44,CrimsonQuill,At all.
13-11-2018T17:09:54,CrimsonQuill,"No spoilers, please, by the way."
13-11-2018T17:11:09,Vatruvius,I have not played and don't think I will. Not my type of game I don't think.
13-11-2018T17:12:26,TerraTheWizard,glhf crimson
13-11-2018T17:12:34,Vatruvius,Gosh darn it!
13-11-2018T17:12:45,Vatruvius,:angry:
13-11-2018T17:12:55,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
13-11-2018T17:13:22,CrimsonQuill,???
13-11-2018T17:13:24,Vatruvius,I can't reduce my webcomic into one sentence! I just can't! I don't even know where to start the sentence! Agh!
13-11-2018T17:13:34,Twokinds,Why would you want to?
13-11-2018T17:13:50,CrimsonQuill,"What webcomic do you write Vatruvius? Alspo, hello Tom."
13-11-2018T17:14:14,CrimsonQuill,Sleep well?
13-11-2018T17:14:58,Vatruvius,I have just been having a hard time decided what direction to go from where I am right now which is little more than a 10 page intro. I am hoping that reducing my webcomic into once sentence will help me find a direction or common theme to go for.
13-11-2018T17:15:28,Vatruvius,"My webcomic is in the works Crimson, very much the early stages."
13-11-2018T17:16:04,CrimsonQuill,My works are...nonexistant. Owing to massive procrastination.
13-11-2018T17:16:29,Vatruvius,Then get on it.
13-11-2018T17:16:39,Vatruvius,"It takes a lot of effort and time, I can attest to that."
13-11-2018T17:16:43,CrimsonQuill,I have a Doctor Who/Star Trek crossover that I want to write. It has Daleks.
13-11-2018T17:16:58,Vatruvius,"And it is rather fun, when it is not frustrating."
13-11-2018T17:17:10,CrimsonQuill,"My problem is that I lack patience, and lack the patience to acquire patience. I'm attempting to fix that."
13-11-2018T17:17:26,CrimsonQuill,"For one thing, I'm going to cut down on TV tropes and Video Games."
13-11-2018T17:17:48,Bgrmystr2,games can actually help you gain paitence
13-11-2018T17:17:54,Bgrmystr2,just gotta play the right games
13-11-2018T17:18:13,Vatruvius,^
13-11-2018T17:18:31,CrimsonQuill,"Well...yes, I suppose...I'll need a lot of patience for example to build a functioning rocket in KSP or beat Undyne in Undertale"
13-11-2018T17:19:17,Vatruvius,I have been told that Alien Isolation is a patience heavy game. I love it so I do not notice but other friends of mine can't stand the game because they say it moves too slowly. I certainly do not want to be moving fast with an Alien about.
13-11-2018T17:19:53,Vatruvius,That works too. But you will need even more patience getting a rocket/plane to work in KSP with FAR and other mods.
13-11-2018T17:19:54,CrimsonQuill,"My friend shared it with me. I am terrified beyond beilief just playing it, despite watching the entire thing on Mark's channel."
13-11-2018T17:20:08,TerraTheWizard,i've managed to finally work through my list of things i want to do
13-11-2018T17:20:20,Vatruvius,"I was the same way until I ""put my man pants on"" as Mark would say it."
13-11-2018T17:20:23,TerraTheWizard,but i got to the point of putting stuff on the list off by doing other stuff on the list
13-11-2018T17:20:52,CrimsonQuill,@TerraTheWizard I need to make a list like that...and follow it.
13-11-2018T17:20:53,Vatruvius,"Still have a hard time with horror games, but at least I have played a few. SOMA and Alien Isolation are great."
13-11-2018T17:21:04,TerraTheWizard,"i've avoided my ""learn to art again"" by writing"
13-11-2018T17:21:06,TerraTheWizard,lol
13-11-2018T17:22:09,Vatruvius,"Well, I don't have that problem since I never officially learned to art so..."
13-11-2018T17:22:22,CrimsonQuill,I realy want to learn to art.
13-11-2018T17:22:33,CrimsonQuill,I want to draw Manga and Aircraft cutaways.
13-11-2018T17:22:46,CrimsonQuill,And cats.
13-11-2018T17:22:49,CrimsonQuill,Lots of cats.
13-11-2018T17:22:52,Vatruvius,"My plan, to just start drawing and go from there. The more I draw, the more I learn, etc."
13-11-2018T17:23:43,CrimsonQuill,"Well, it's almost 10:30pm where I live, and I've been up far too late over the past few weeks, so I'm going to have to head for bed."
13-11-2018T17:24:00,CrimsonQuill,Goodnight all! :ptv-greetings::ptv-greetings::ptv-greetings:
13-11-2018T17:24:16,Vatruvius,Goodnight Crimson
13-11-2018T17:26:46,Vatruvius,"Thing is this sentence statement is suppose to represent what your comic is about except that I am not entirely sure what my webcomic is about. I have an idea of the things I want in the comic, I have a world, I have two main characters, but I have no"
13-11-2018T17:27:02,Vatruvius,idea how to word what the story is about.
13-11-2018T17:27:24,Vatruvius,"This is going to drive me insane for the next week, I can just tell."
13-11-2018T17:27:45,SpazztasticKiwi,:ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake:insane?!?
13-11-2018T17:28:12,Vatruvius,Yup.
13-11-2018T17:28:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, as much Mark talks about putting man pants on, he also preaches about never wearing pants"
13-11-2018T17:28:25,Vatruvius,Maybe I will come out sane on the other end but who knows?!
13-11-2018T17:28:34,Vatruvius,lol
13-11-2018T17:28:37,Bgrmystr2,they're metaphorical man pants
13-11-2018T17:28:37,Vatruvius,This is true.
13-11-2018T17:28:40,Bgrmystr2,not physical man pants
13-11-2018T17:28:47,Vatruvius,Also true.
13-11-2018T17:28:59,SpazztasticKiwi,You‚Äôre confusing the wee ones mark:ctwokinds-floAAA:
13-11-2018T17:30:18,SpazztasticKiwi,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
13-11-2018T17:33:57,Vatruvius,"How do you decide scenes Tom? Like, how do you decided character interaction? What pushes characters together or pushes them apart? It takes a considerable amount of time for me to think of something."
13-11-2018T17:44:47,Twokinds,It's hard for me too
13-11-2018T17:45:27,Vatruvius,Well that is partially releaving.
13-11-2018T17:45:44,Vatruvius,relieving*
13-11-2018T17:45:47,Twokinds,"It's mostly just giving your characters stuff they want, and then showing how that plays of each other as they go about getting it (or failing to get it)"
13-11-2018T17:46:20,Vatruvius,"Well, at least I now know I am going about this the right way. Thanks."
13-11-2018T17:46:46,Vatruvius,"I also think I have the beginning of my story statement, a rough draft if you will."
13-11-2018T17:50:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"So basically Tom, you wing it?"
13-11-2018T17:51:58,Vatruvius,"Shh, don't question the master!"
13-11-2018T17:52:28,SpazztasticKiwi,He just admitted to it more or less:ctwokinds-flomad:
13-11-2018T17:52:41,Twokinds,:dove:
13-11-2018T17:52:46,SpazztasticKiwi,How is that questioning the ‚Äúmaster‚Äù
13-11-2018T17:53:11,Vatruvius,I know for a fact that it is not 100% winged. From future discussions there is an overarching plot or goals Tom tries to meet.
13-11-2018T17:53:41,SpazztasticKiwi,So the moral of the story is: an attempt is made
13-11-2018T17:53:53,Vatruvius,"And from the perspective of working on my own webcomic, I cannot fault Tom for the way he goes about writing Twokinds."
13-11-2018T17:53:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Whether or not it produces fruit is another story
13-11-2018T17:54:10,Vatruvius,"I am going about it the same way, it just seems logical when all the characters are in your head."
13-11-2018T17:54:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Sound like how I start an animal style
13-11-2018T17:55:34,Vatruvius,"Well, that is very much how it is in life. No attempt means no fruit, while an attempt has the possibility of fruit. And considering Tom has been getting fruit for 15 years I say it has been quite successful."
13-11-2018T17:55:42,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúHow can I make a form of this animal that‚Äôs stylized but looks like the animal‚Äù
13-11-2018T17:56:09,SpazztasticKiwi,üçèüçéüçêüçãüçáüçìüçåüçëüççü•ù
13-11-2018T17:56:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Fruit
13-11-2018T17:56:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I got work in like 5 minutes
13-11-2018T17:56:37,Vatruvius,Best of luck...
13-11-2018T17:57:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"It‚Äôs only the rear end, closing shift. About 5 hours. But it‚Äôs closing and I think I gotta new person with me"
13-11-2018T17:57:37,Vatruvius,"So who would you describe as the protagonist in Twokinds Tom? Though Trace seems to be the center of the overarching story, Flora has a huge influence."
13-11-2018T17:58:03,Vatruvius,Not to mention Group B now being a prominent cast.
13-11-2018T17:58:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I should return for break and then at the end maybe at 10. Who knows
13-11-2018T17:58:16,SpazztasticKiwi,But I guess I‚Äôll go on üëãüèª
13-11-2018T17:58:40,Twokinds,It's a ensemble
13-11-2018T17:59:22,Twokinds,Trace Flora Keith and Natani are the main protags
13-11-2018T17:59:47,Vatruvius,"Interesting really, since Natani came somewhat later on."
13-11-2018T17:59:55,Vatruvius,But rather like it.
13-11-2018T18:00:00,Bgrmystr2,main protag doesn't always get to be there from the beginning.
13-11-2018T18:01:04,TerraTheWizard,i zoned out of chat there for a sec and there was a brief intermission between comic talk for fruit?
13-11-2018T18:01:14,Vatruvius,"At the moment I have two main characters. I want both to be a focal point but given the twist in my webcomic, only one can be the focal point and protagonist."
13-11-2018T18:01:29,Vatruvius,Fruit was comic talk...
13-11-2018T18:01:34,TerraTheWizard,oh
13-11-2018T18:02:53,TerraTheWizard,"ok, i see what happened now"
13-11-2018T18:03:34,Vatruvius,It is really hard for me to determine the story statement when I have no idea of what happens with my story past the first major climax or realization for my webcomic.
13-11-2018T18:04:10,Vatruvius,"Evil dude exists, main characters defeat him, cliche cliche...so on."
13-11-2018T18:04:21,Vatruvius,I really have nothing...
13-11-2018T18:05:32,Bgrmystr2,yeah see that's why I like some series where it has some realllllllly good villains
13-11-2018T18:05:49,Bgrmystr2,villains whose motives are hard to find fault in and arguably better than the hero's.
13-11-2018T18:06:12,Vatruvius,Like Thanos?
13-11-2018T18:06:14,Bgrmystr2,makes you question whether you're the good guy
13-11-2018T18:06:15,Bgrmystr2,lol no
13-11-2018T18:06:22,Bgrmystr2,he was a selfish dude
13-11-2018T18:06:37,Vatruvius,Did you see the film theory on his plan?
13-11-2018T18:06:40,Bgrmystr2,yes
13-11-2018T18:06:45,Bgrmystr2,I stand by my statement.
13-11-2018T18:06:52,Vatruvius,I was...surprised and hurt.
13-11-2018T18:07:02,Vatruvius,How can the villian be right!?
13-11-2018T18:07:08,Bgrmystr2,he's not though
13-11-2018T18:07:10,Vatruvius,villain*
13-11-2018T18:07:14,TerraTheWizard,thanos can't math
13-11-2018T18:07:26,Vatruvius,"Well, not entirely but his method and the result there after was right."
13-11-2018T18:07:32,Bgrmystr2,cuz he's just pushing murder on everyone without bothering to think of the consequences.
13-11-2018T18:07:35,Bgrmystr2,and no it wasn't
13-11-2018T18:07:36,Vatruvius,But it was not the right way to go about it or to solve that issue.
13-11-2018T18:07:41,TerraTheWizard,also humans breed like rabbits
13-11-2018T18:07:49,Bgrmystr2,we don't tho terra xD
13-11-2018T18:07:52,Bgrmystr2,way slower
13-11-2018T18:08:11,TerraTheWizard,"well, we don't get killed off as much as rabbits"
13-11-2018T18:08:11,Vatruvius,We are actually growing in population more slowly every year.
13-11-2018T18:08:33,Bgrmystr2,a few rabbits can end up turning into hundreds in one lifetime.
13-11-2018T18:08:44,TerraTheWizard,"but yeah, iirc they worked it out that if thanos poofed half of the humans, it'd only take like 20 years to get back to where we were pre-snap"
13-11-2018T18:08:44,Bgrmystr2,a few humans would have a hell of a time matching that.
13-11-2018T18:09:12,Bgrmystr2,perhaps yeah terra
13-11-2018T18:09:29,Vatruvius,Problem with humans is how long it takes to raise one...very long time. One of the longest in the world if not the longest known to science I believe.
13-11-2018T18:09:34,Bgrmystr2,but let's just ignore that half of everyone you knew is now gone. :ptv-unimpressed:
13-11-2018T18:09:43,Bgrmystr2,because that's not an asshole thing to do.
13-11-2018T18:09:45,Bgrmystr2,not at all
13-11-2018T18:09:52,Vatruvius,lol
13-11-2018T18:10:25,Vatruvius,"I mean, I would like to think my villain is really good. He is kinda all powerful and all knowing..."
13-11-2018T18:10:33,Bgrmystr2,pushes 50% population murder on everyone and acts like it's some big salvation..
13-11-2018T18:10:34,Bgrmystr2,man
13-11-2018T18:10:51,Bgrmystr2,"when it comes down to brass tax, there will always be men like him."
13-11-2018T18:10:57,Bgrmystr2,pushing his ideals on others
13-11-2018T18:11:03,Bgrmystr2,and being powerful enough to screw everyone else
13-11-2018T18:11:13,Bgrmystr2,and thinking he's the best thing since sliced bread.
13-11-2018T18:11:30,Bgrmystr2,he's no hero.
13-11-2018T18:11:36,Bgrmystr2,no savior
13-11-2018T18:11:39,Bgrmystr2,and never will be.
13-11-2018T18:11:40,Vatruvius,I never said he was.
13-11-2018T18:11:51,Bgrmystr2,not the good guy. :u
13-11-2018T18:11:52,Vatruvius,Who is a good villain to you Bgr?
13-11-2018T18:12:13,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, several characters from the touhou project come to mind"
13-11-2018T18:12:31,Vatruvius,"Well, I have no idea what that is..."
13-11-2018T18:12:45,Bgrmystr2,"there's been a bunch I saw in anime as well, though I can't recall names"
13-11-2018T18:13:07,Vatruvius,What is the motive of one villain that you like?
13-11-2018T18:13:23,Vatruvius,What are they trying to achieve?
13-11-2018T18:14:16,Bgrmystr2,Byakuren was cast out by humans for turning to non-buddism arts to gain youth and for seeing pity in youkai
13-11-2018T18:14:25,Bgrmystr2,and she just wants peace between them
13-11-2018T18:15:03,Bgrmystr2,"and actually goes out of her way to build an entire shrine in a human village that contains youkai that aren't hostile to humans at all, and welcome them there"
13-11-2018T18:15:27,Bgrmystr2,she saw there was a plight for both and tries to fix both of em
13-11-2018T18:15:54,Vatruvius,"So, someone who could have been the hero of the story is instead the villain from another's perspective?"
13-11-2018T18:15:59,Bgrmystr2,but because she was flying around in a big ass ship in the air.. the protag of the game goes to investigate.
13-11-2018T18:16:08,Bgrmystr2,thinking it's a treasure ship
13-11-2018T18:16:10,Bgrmystr2,:P
13-11-2018T18:16:26,Bgrmystr2,and that it's not something that's supposed to be there
13-11-2018T18:16:45,Bgrmystr2,"so ya go in, shoot first, ask questions later."
13-11-2018T18:17:00,Bgrmystr2,everyone goes home with tattered clothes but otherwise mostly unharmed.
13-11-2018T18:17:33,Bgrmystr2,yeah a lot of the touhou project is basically.. what kind of villain does the game have
13-11-2018T18:18:15,Vatruvius,Hmm...
13-11-2018T18:18:16,Bgrmystr2,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/250139544517607424/512405850665517116/Touhou_in_nutshell.png relevant :u
13-11-2018T18:19:04,Bgrmystr2,there's a huge vibrance
13-11-2018T18:19:21,Vatruvius,I see...
13-11-2018T18:20:09,Bgrmystr2,Like..
13-11-2018T18:20:33,Bgrmystr2,"I enjoyed the beginning of Borderlands 2, Handsome Jack was, yknow.. an overbearing but amusing villain"
13-11-2018T18:20:55,Bgrmystr2,and halfway into the game they just threw it away and turned him into a selfish hypocritical asshat
13-11-2018T18:20:59,Vatruvius,"Well, my villain is technically ruling society but no one knows it. Unsure as of yet how I really want to shape him. But I am leaning towards his rise to power was to amend a situation in the past that would have gone terrible wrong."
13-11-2018T18:21:45,Vatruvius,So his claim to power is keeping society from destroying itself...basically.
13-11-2018T18:22:20,Bgrmystr2,yeah painting your villain into a situation where the hero of your story would have done the same thing in that situatino
13-11-2018T18:22:23,Bgrmystr2,or even
13-11-2018T18:22:32,Bgrmystr2,that the villain sacrificed moreso than the hero would have been willing to
13-11-2018T18:22:43,Bgrmystr2,makes for some real good reveals
13-11-2018T18:23:02,Vatruvius,"Well, I got that working for me then."
13-11-2018T18:23:33,Vatruvius,"Still have a lot of work to do but yeah, getting there. Slowly but surely."
13-11-2018T18:23:49,TerraTheWizard,neat
13-11-2018T18:23:51,Bgrmystr2,and then the villain gets beat up by the hero for something that the hero wouldn't even have done in the first place to make things better.. makes for a tragic story where the reader doesn't even know who to root for anymore
13-11-2018T18:24:57,Vatruvius,"Well, though the villain certainly is acting for the betterment of society, I am not sure if he still is anymore."
13-11-2018T18:25:18,Bgrmystr2,"super bonus points if what actually made society better as a whole was the villain himself, he was, in effect, ""The hero the world knew existed, but never knew who it was"""
13-11-2018T18:25:23,Vatruvius,"Or rather, is protection is what caused the main character to become the hero?"
13-11-2018T18:25:49,Vatruvius,I already beat you there Bgr.
13-11-2018T18:25:59,Bgrmystr2,Okay
13-11-2018T18:26:53,Vatruvius,Somewhat anyway.
13-11-2018T18:27:07,Bgrmystr2,quad score if your villain is what sowed the seeds for the hero to become the hero in the first place to create some inevitable fight of old hero vs new hero that the villain knew was coming because he planned it to begin with to bring to light
13-11-2018T18:27:13,Bgrmystr2,what really happened when the  villain was the hero
13-11-2018T18:27:41,Vatruvius,"He is what helped keep society from falling apart, but in the process erased his own history and that of the past so as to remake society better."
13-11-2018T18:28:08,Vatruvius,Now that is interesting...
13-11-2018T18:28:49,Vatruvius,"But I do not think my villain sowed the seeds for the hero, rather he knew there was something he had to watch out for that was out of his control."
13-11-2018T18:29:12,Vatruvius,"So he tried to keep it buried and from ""rising up"" so to speak."
13-11-2018T18:29:26,Bgrmystr2,yeah
13-11-2018T18:29:54,Bgrmystr2,"it's all been done before, obviously, or I wouldn't know about it, but it's usually done very well because you don't see stuff like that"
13-11-2018T18:30:04,Bgrmystr2,"usually villain is just.. ""I'm the bad guy rawr"""
13-11-2018T18:30:10,Bgrmystr2,and does obvious bad things
13-11-2018T18:30:29,Bgrmystr2,and has no actual depth.. nothing he's trying to prove
13-11-2018T18:30:37,Bgrmystr2,nothing that drives him
13-11-2018T18:30:44,Bgrmystr2,he's just there to be the bad guy
13-11-2018T18:30:51,Bgrmystr2,not because he has a reason to.
13-11-2018T18:31:23,Vatruvius,"Interesting thing is, my villain is very powerful. His rise to power left him believing he is the only one to keep the world from burning again and so found immortality, or everlasting life. He can ""die""."
13-11-2018T18:31:28,Bgrmystr2,That is what makes up most villains.. and they're not good character
13-11-2018T18:31:32,Bgrmystr2,s
13-11-2018T18:32:05,Bgrmystr2,"lol, yeah you can't let all your power go to your head"
13-11-2018T18:32:11,Bgrmystr2,or you really do become the villain
13-11-2018T18:32:20,Bgrmystr2,"the right idea, but going about it the wrong way"
13-11-2018T18:33:14,Vatruvius,"This is all ""work in progress"". None of this is set in stone and none of it is something that is immediately obvious in the beginning of the webcomic."
13-11-2018T18:33:52,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's fairly normal
13-11-2018T18:34:05,Bgrmystr2,Just keep your eye out what makes a good/bad character
13-11-2018T18:34:11,Bgrmystr2,what pushes them forward and stuff
13-11-2018T18:34:32,Bgrmystr2,it's okay to have bad people that are selfish and not very nice
13-11-2018T18:34:36,Vatruvius,My goal is to make my villain a very complex character. I want him to have as much depth as my main characters.
13-11-2018T18:34:49,Bgrmystr2,"because they, too, can be pushed by something that makes them a good character"
13-11-2018T18:35:04,Bgrmystr2,yeah you're doing a good.
13-11-2018T18:35:11,Bgrmystr2,keep doing that good.
13-11-2018T18:35:44,Vatruvius,I will sir!
13-11-2018T18:35:46,Vatruvius,Xd
13-11-2018T18:35:50,Vatruvius,XD*
13-11-2018T18:38:32,Vatruvius,My problem will certainly be trying to express my villain's complexity. There is a very specific type of story telling I am using for my webcomic which severely limits my ability to jump from character to character.
13-11-2018T18:39:21,Vatruvius,"So such expression will have to come from research that my protagonist does. For example, finds illegal, history tellings of what happened during the villain's time, etc."
13-11-2018T18:39:35,Vatruvius,historic*
13-11-2018T18:40:21,Bgrmystr2,yeah
13-11-2018T18:40:31,Bgrmystr2,using good/bad stuff in history
13-11-2018T18:41:02,Bgrmystr2,and how the history books write what happened vs what people TELL you what they experienced.. and the reason why those stories don't always match up
13-11-2018T18:41:11,Bgrmystr2,and it's cuz the villain would know what actually happens
13-11-2018T18:41:19,Vatruvius,To think developing my villain's character would help me world build a bit more...interesting.
13-11-2018T18:41:21,Bgrmystr2,giving a lore reveal when you meet them
13-11-2018T18:41:34,Bgrmystr2,yeah it's nice
13-11-2018T18:42:26,Vatruvius,I was putting him off because it would be a long way away before he is known but it is helpful.
13-11-2018T18:42:29,Twokinds,Pff
13-11-2018T18:42:39,Vatruvius,:ptv-wondering:
13-11-2018T18:42:56,Twokinds,Why does a villian need motivation. They should just want to take over the world!
13-11-2018T18:43:06,Vatruvius,lol
13-11-2018T18:43:19,Bgrmystr2,"rofl, bad villains with Tom"
13-11-2018T18:43:47,Vatruvius,Obvious bad villain is bad and must be slain by good hero.
13-11-2018T18:43:49,Vatruvius,XD
13-11-2018T18:43:57,Bgrmystr2,ikrrr
13-11-2018T18:44:36,TerraTheWizard,"i mod a writing site, on our discord we had a topic that was:"
13-11-2018T18:44:40,BadFoMo,"@Twokinds ""Of Corse!"""
13-11-2018T18:44:45,TerraTheWizard,"""she's a teen, why is she committing war crimes"""
13-11-2018T18:45:15,Vatruvius,What!?
13-11-2018T18:45:38,TerraTheWizard,"also about the same character, ""she's a spoiled brat, why is she torturing someone"""
13-11-2018T18:46:04,Vatruvius,WHAT!?
13-11-2018T18:46:07,TerraTheWizard,main story point is there's a stone that grants wishes
13-11-2018T18:46:24,Vatruvius,So a philosopher's stone?
13-11-2018T18:46:29,TerraTheWizard,bratty character gets it and this one author takes her wayyy off the rails
13-11-2018T18:46:33,Bgrmystr2,"btw Vatru, there's no reason to have the villain unknown. You can always make the villain be someone the viewer already knows."
13-11-2018T18:46:56,TerraTheWizard,"like, she goes from ""i don't like you"" to ""i'm going to make your life literal hell"" within 2 paragraphs"
13-11-2018T18:47:05,Vatruvius,Like the head of government or something...? To the public is the hero? Hmm...
13-11-2018T18:47:22,Bgrmystr2,well no not really cuz
13-11-2018T18:47:26,Bgrmystr2,you always suspect them
13-11-2018T18:47:32,TerraTheWizard,"the stone works with, you can make any wish, but you can't unwish it"
13-11-2018T18:47:38,TerraTheWizard,you can modify wishes though
13-11-2018T18:47:53,Bgrmystr2,I was thinking just... random dude you meet. like the guy that owns the bookstore
13-11-2018T18:47:59,Bgrmystr2,or works at the antique shop
13-11-2018T18:48:03,Bgrmystr2,or that kinda stuff
13-11-2018T18:48:15,Bgrmystr2,just your average joe trying to make a living
13-11-2018T18:48:21,Vatruvius,Hmm...I will have to think on that.
13-11-2018T18:48:35,Bgrmystr2,and it wouldn't be amiss for the villain to be doing so because if your villain really is trying to change things for the better
13-11-2018T18:48:49,Vatruvius,I highly doubt he would be some average guy but certainly could be a part of public society.
13-11-2018T18:48:51,Bgrmystr2,having an average joe view of the world he's trying to change is a necessary perspective.
13-11-2018T18:49:08,Bgrmystr2,just having the perspective is important
13-11-2018T18:49:12,Bgrmystr2,what he does can be up for debate
13-11-2018T18:49:30,Vatruvius,"Perhaps at one point in his life, but that would have been his past and not the present of the webcomic."
13-11-2018T18:50:00,Bgrmystr2,"it also can be used so the villain can keep track of the heros personally, even interacting with them to see how they grow"
13-11-2018T18:50:55,Vatruvius,"Yeah, I have seen that before. It is a neat idea but not the direction my webcomic is going."
13-11-2018T18:51:08,Bgrmystr2,fair enough
13-11-2018T18:51:23,Bgrmystr2,"maybe your villain isn't doing it, but perhaps an idea you can use for someone else."
13-11-2018T18:51:39,Vatruvius,Perhaps.
13-11-2018T18:51:40,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, that's the great thing about stories"
13-11-2018T18:51:59,Bgrmystr2,you can mix and match the things that make good stories at your leisure
13-11-2018T18:51:59,Vatruvius,"I am not that far with characters. Only have the three, the two main characters and the villain."
13-11-2018T18:52:54,Vatruvius,"Thinking the villain has a highly trusted and able lieutenant, but not sure on that front."
13-11-2018T18:54:44,Vatruvius,You just game me an interesting idea Bgr...
13-11-2018T18:56:25,Bgrmystr2,"ayy, brainstorming 101"
13-11-2018T18:56:48,Bgrmystr2,that's how you idea. :ok_hand:
13-11-2018T18:56:58,Vatruvius,Always.
13-11-2018T19:08:14,Vatruvius,Hey unsteddy!

13-11-2018T19:14:05,Bgrmystr2,shh people are sleeping in the chat :P
13-11-2018T19:14:11,Vatruvius,lol

13-11-2018T20:21:00,Mippy,Hello
13-11-2018T20:22:34,RimaDraws,hi mippy
13-11-2018T20:24:16,Mippy,That Pie Face game is a horrible waste of whipped cream. :ctwokinds-sadtrace2:
13-11-2018T20:24:22,RimaDraws,mhmm
13-11-2018T20:26:22,Mippy,:ctwokinds-natanisleep:
13-11-2018T20:26:38,Mippy,(Falls under the sleep spell)
13-11-2018T20:28:59,Vatruvius,NO! Don't fall under the spell Mippy!
13-11-2018T20:29:03,Vatruvius,Nooo!
13-11-2018T20:57:19,Vatruvius,"If you are still here Tom, at what point did you realize drawing Twokinds that you would be drawing bosoms regularly?"
13-11-2018T20:58:47,Twokinds,lol
13-11-2018T20:58:54,Twokinds,I dunno
13-11-2018T20:59:56,Vatruvius,I personally would freak out realizing that this is what I will be doing until I got use to it. Doubt my parents would think kindly on it.
13-11-2018T21:00:46,Vatruvius,"Luckily, I do not really have to worry about it with my webcomic. Because clothes and stuff, modern society."
13-11-2018T21:00:47,Vatruvius,XD
13-11-2018T21:09:29,RimaDraws,i started drawing boobs at an early age
13-11-2018T21:10:59,RimaDraws,my first few arts were pokemon characters
13-11-2018T21:11:10,Vatruvius,"I have not even started nor do I plan to at first. If if comes up as something needed in my webcomic, which I am sure will happen at some point, I will but until then I will leave it be."
13-11-2018T21:11:17,Vatruvius,...
13-11-2018T21:11:19,Vatruvius,...
13-11-2018T21:11:36,Vatruvius,Uhh...
13-11-2018T21:13:56,RimaDraws,??
13-11-2018T21:14:11,RimaDraws,mind you this was when i was 13 yrs old. im 31 now
13-11-2018T21:14:45,Vatruvius,"Those do not sound like PG drawings of pokemon, but what do I know? Only thing I know about Pokemon is...well...that is about it really."
13-11-2018T21:15:05,RimaDraws,i mean this was g rated
13-11-2018T21:15:11,RimaDraws,i mean boobs as in g rated boobs
13-11-2018T21:15:14,RimaDraws,ugh pervert
13-11-2018T21:15:37,Vatruvius,I am a pervert?
13-11-2018T21:16:14,Vatruvius,"You said you were drawing boobs at an early age and some of your first drawings were pokemon, so my mind went to boobs on pokemon?"
13-11-2018T21:16:21,RimaDraws,uh no.....
13-11-2018T21:16:51,Vatruvius,"Well, that sounds a little better. And for the record, I am not a pervert."
13-11-2018T21:17:06,RimaDraws,whatever floats your boat mate
13-11-2018T21:18:12,Vatruvius,"And I was not thinking pornographic drawings if that is what you mean when I said ""not PG""."
13-11-2018T21:18:21,RimaDraws,k
13-11-2018T21:18:35,Vatruvius,...
13-11-2018T21:18:47,Vatruvius,"See, now I am all worried about how others view me."
13-11-2018T21:18:50,Vatruvius,Ugh...
13-11-2018T21:20:18,RimaDraws,um sorry?
13-11-2018T21:21:01,Vatruvius,"No, it is okay. Things are often misunderstood via online communication."
13-11-2018T21:30:46,Mippy,All of us are a little bit pervy. :ctwokinds-MikeLewd:
13-11-2018T21:32:06,Vatruvius,"I suppose that is a little bit true, but I much rather be recognized as a furry and not partially perverted."
13-11-2018T21:33:32,Mippy,Practically synomonus with some people...*grumble*
13-11-2018T21:34:03,Bgrmystr2,naw it just seemed like a jump to conclusions vatru
13-11-2018T21:34:09,Bgrmystr2,nothing to worry about
13-11-2018T21:34:15,RimaDraws,im sorry bgr
13-11-2018T21:35:40,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: it's nothing to worry about tho
13-11-2018T21:37:07,Mippy,How dose one report a channel on Youtube these days...just stumbled upon a Mark copycat
13-11-2018T21:37:19,Bgrmystr2,dunno
13-11-2018T21:37:40,Vatruvius,"Not sure, but every company and their mom can do it automatically without finding the video so..."
13-11-2018T21:37:59,Bgrmystr2,and youtube removes it without bothering to look at the damn thing to see if it's true.
13-11-2018T21:38:09,Vatruvius,Exactly.
13-11-2018T21:38:12,Bgrmystr2,and whoever claims it gets the money even if it's a false report.
13-11-2018T21:38:26,Bgrmystr2,cuz ad revenue and whatnot
13-11-2018T21:38:44,Bgrmystr2,"because that's not illegal or anything, totally not theft and negligence."
13-11-2018T21:38:48,Vatruvius,One of the YouTubers I watch had 20 different sound studios claim his video for the same 5 seconds of elevator music he had in the entire 21 minute video.
13-11-2018T21:39:10,Bgrmystr2,lool
13-11-2018T21:39:34,Vatruvius,If that does not show YouTube is working for the companies and not their content creators then I don't know what will.
13-11-2018T21:40:49,Vatruvius,"He had the music legitamentally, proof and all but it was, in his words, ""a bloody nightmare"" getting his monatization back. At that point though, the companies already got all the ad revenue the video would of generated because they ceased the funds when"
13-11-2018T21:40:55,Vatruvius,the video got most of its views.
13-11-2018T21:41:16,Vatruvius,legitimately*
13-11-2018T21:41:53,Mippy,"Eh, *shrug* just googled it"
13-11-2018T21:42:52,Bgrmystr2,yeah
13-11-2018T21:43:03,Bgrmystr2,"and he can sue every single one of them for an illegal report, vatru"
13-11-2018T21:43:07,Bgrmystr2,and he'd win every single won
13-11-2018T21:43:09,Bgrmystr2,one* even
13-11-2018T21:43:50,Vatruvius,"Yeah, but at what cost? He does not have the money for lawyers so..."
13-11-2018T21:43:57,Vatruvius,The record companies sure do so...
13-11-2018T21:44:30,Bgrmystr2,there actually lawyers on youtube that help people with that kind of stuff
13-11-2018T21:45:30,Bgrmystr2,"hell, there's that one dude that's being picked at by apple because they're refusing to let him replace batteries in apple products simply because he's ""importing counterfeits"""
13-11-2018T21:45:49,Bgrmystr2,and apple won't replace the batteries either cuz they just want someone to buy a new one
13-11-2018T21:46:07,Bgrmystr2,and give them garbage tons of money for something they don't deserver
13-11-2018T21:47:25,Vatruvius,"Don't get me started on the whole Apple thing. But maybe, he lives in the UK though so it depends on the law over there."
13-11-2018T21:47:43,Vatruvius,"In either case, it seemed like it was not worth it for him."
13-11-2018T21:47:53,Vatruvius,Just get his video back and move on.
13-11-2018T21:48:17,Bgrmystr2,he lives in the Canada far as I know
13-11-2018T21:48:43,RimaDraws,who?
13-11-2018T21:48:44,Vatruvius,"No, the YouTuber is in the UK."
13-11-2018T21:48:50,Vatruvius,Mighty Jingles
13-11-2018T21:49:00,Bgrmystr2,"oh, you're talkin about that guy"
13-11-2018T21:49:13,Bgrmystr2,I was talking about rossmann
13-11-2018T21:49:28,Vatruvius,Yeah...
13-11-2018T21:49:47,Bgrmystr2,who has an IT shop in canada and runs a youtube channel for explaining how to fix things
13-11-2018T21:50:39,Vatruvius,"Yeah, I know who you are talking about. I don't watch him but LTT featured him once I believe. Or I could be completely mistaken and be thinking of someone else entirely."
13-11-2018T21:50:46,Vatruvius,"In either case, Apple sucks."
13-11-2018T21:50:55,Vatruvius,Now they got that stupid hardware thing going on.
13-11-2018T21:50:56,RimaDraws,ahhh i disagree
13-11-2018T21:51:31,Vatruvius,:face_palm:
13-11-2018T21:51:34,Bgrmystr2,yeah he was featured on LTT
13-11-2018T21:52:05,RimaDraws,"im the kind of person who is all about ""if you take care of your electronics which means updating and such then your stuff will last"""
13-11-2018T21:52:18,RimaDraws,i own a windows and apple product
13-11-2018T21:52:26,RimaDraws,three apple products actually
13-11-2018T21:52:43,Vatruvius,"I am not saying that are bad products, just that Apple as a company and what they charge you for what you are getting, sucks."
13-11-2018T21:53:01,Bgrmystr2,"taking care of it doesn't really apply though. Plenty of people, including myself, take care of things better than most others.. while some people just toss the shit around like it doesn't matter"
13-11-2018T21:53:03,Vatruvius,that their products are bad*
13-11-2018T21:53:07,RimaDraws,yes but i had to save for my stuff so im not one who can just buy willy nilly

13-11-2018T21:53:16,Bgrmystr2,and we have issues while ppl who treat their items like shit never see any problems
13-11-2018T21:53:31,Bgrmystr2,it doesn't always work to standard.
13-11-2018T21:55:23,RimaDraws,ok
13-11-2018T21:55:35,Bgrmystr2,"a lot of apple products are decent, but they're overcharging for the generally outdated hardware you get, pulling prices out of their ass for exorbitant repair bills,  and they won't let anyone fix something when they refuse to fix it themselves"
13-11-2018T21:55:40,Bgrmystr2,there's a lot of wrong
13-11-2018T21:55:49,RimaDraws,ok

13-11-2018T23:30:17,Mippy,"I mean, I've gained some tolerance over the years but too much still makes me feel sick"
13-11-2018T23:30:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs technically a too much limit for everyone
13-11-2018T23:31:53,RimaDraws,i have it
13-11-2018T23:31:55,Mippy,"Yeah, technically...but I don't know quite how to explain"

13-11-2018T23:33:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Sad times
13-11-2018T23:33:12,Mippy,:ctwokinds-sadtrace2:
13-11-2018T23:33:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I eat some odd food combos tho. Like I will put oj in my cereal
13-11-2018T23:34:04,SpazztasticKiwi,With the milk
13-11-2018T23:34:29,Mippy,It dose not curdle?
13-11-2018T23:34:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Not really
13-11-2018T23:35:04,SpazztasticKiwi,It adds just a touch of sourness is all
13-11-2018T23:35:17,Mippy,But you are talking to the person who eats peanut butter and cucumber sandwhiches
13-11-2018T23:36:33,Mippy,"So, whatever flotes your boat...as long as it dose not make you sick"
13-11-2018T23:36:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"Date idea: you and your partner show each other your weirdest, most odd and/or slightly disgusting food combo and make a lunch date out of it"
13-11-2018T23:37:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you can stomach each other after that, you‚Äôre in good standing"
13-11-2018T23:38:03,Mippy,XD Sounds like a plan.
13-11-2018T23:38:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"I had a bf that HATED tomatoes. Thought they were disgusting. But ate ketchup, of course"
13-11-2018T23:39:36,SpazztasticKiwi,He could not stand how I could eat a tomato straight off a vine - like an apple - with some salt (dad‚Äôs influence there - he ate them the same)
13-11-2018T23:39:49,RimaDraws,ew
13-11-2018T23:41:17,Mippy,*blink* I eat Tomatoes with salt and pepper
13-11-2018T23:41:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Its soooo good
13-11-2018T23:41:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"I can eat two or three, maybe more"
13-11-2018T23:42:28,Mippy,I often eat Tomato sandwhiches as a lunch in the summer
13-11-2018T23:43:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tomato, mayo, and cheese?"
13-11-2018T23:43:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I sometimes do that. Not terribly often. And I‚Äôll add lettuce if it‚Äôs there
13-11-2018T23:44:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder if this is one of the reasons I‚Äôm still single
13-11-2018T23:44:17,Mippy,"No cheese usually. Tomato, mayo, salt, pepper. Usually toasted bred"
13-11-2018T23:44:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though I guess if I‚Äôm not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea, but imma be somebody‚Äôs milkshake"
13-11-2018T23:44:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Toasty bread üçû..
13-11-2018T23:44:59,Mippy,Kiwi's milkshake will bring someone to the yard eventually
13-11-2018T23:45:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Eventually
13-11-2018T23:45:41,SpazztasticKiwi,And they‚Äôll have to come to me cause God knows I never leave the house
13-11-2018T23:47:06,Mippy,I'm still most comfy at home but part of my mental heath treatment is to get out more. I might meet somone nice at the comic book store someday
13-11-2018T23:47:35,Mippy,(it's one of the few places I actually willingly go)
13-11-2018T23:48:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I hear Star Wars boys are out of this world. Might have to try netting one of them
13-11-2018T23:48:54,Mippy,As long as he's willing to be Han Solo.
13-11-2018T23:52:15,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs actually a Princess Leia wedding hair style that I actually love
13-11-2018T23:53:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"Came across awhile ago and at this point, I‚Äôd try it out if it fit the dress and I got married sometime in about the next year"
13-11-2018T23:53:56,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs the first result searching ‚Äúprincess leia wedding hair‚Äù
13-11-2018T23:54:07,Mippy,I just want someone to cosplay/roleplay with :ctwokinds-sadtrace2:.
13-11-2018T23:54:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"Problem is, pigtails and side buns don‚Äôt go well on me"
13-11-2018T23:55:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm pretty sure at this point I just need a bf to get rid of this single bitterness
13-11-2018T23:55:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Valentines makes me :ctwokinds-power: kinda
13-11-2018T23:56:09,Mippy,I haven't tried side buns. Hair is not long enough yet but I think I look cute in pigtails
13-11-2018T23:56:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Pigtails take off like ten years for me sometimes
13-11-2018T23:57:05,SpazztasticKiwi,As if people didn‚Äôt mistake me for a teenager as it is
13-11-2018T23:57:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"But at the same time, being single is nice. And looking hasn‚Äôt fared me but the relationships I‚Äôve had. As ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù as they turned out"
13-11-2018T23:58:44,Mippy,being mistaken for someone much youbger dose not bother me that much. I'm gonna do what I'm gonna do regardless. Don't feel bad...I've never been on a single date
13-11-2018T23:59:58,Mippy,(Mental heath issues make dating a bit difficult)
