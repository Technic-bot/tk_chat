02-05-2018T00:01:06,TheBeckoner,secretly his hair fans out into a protective shade
02-05-2018T00:01:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Now I’m just imagining a frilled lizard
02-05-2018T00:03:05,TheBeckoner,I was thinking some sort of hair umbrella
02-05-2018T00:03:06,Vatruvius,Hello people! :ptv-greetings:
02-05-2018T00:03:08,TheBeckoner,less uhh

02-05-2018T00:03:23,TheBeckoner,Hey VAt
02-05-2018T00:03:27,TheBeckoner,smol a
02-05-2018T00:04:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Hey Vat. We’re talking about Tom’s hair and how it protects him as he mows the lawn as he said he did so this morning
02-05-2018T00:04:49,Bgrmystr2,Staying inside doesn't really make you pale. I'm a perfect example of that not being true.
02-05-2018T00:05:01,Vatruvius,"Don't think that is how hair works, and good for Tom to get some sunshine."
02-05-2018T00:05:15,TheBeckoner,you downer
02-05-2018T00:05:23,TheBeckoner,course it works that way
02-05-2018T00:05:25,Bgrmystr2,"going outside for too long, however, does tend to make your skin darker and give you sunburns lol"
02-05-2018T00:05:33,SpazztasticKiwi,There are those with a natural tan
02-05-2018T00:05:47,Bgrmystr2,"that's not natural, it's from being in the sun"
02-05-2018T00:05:51,Bgrmystr2,xD
02-05-2018T00:06:06,Bgrmystr2,it's totally the opposite of what people commonly accept
02-05-2018T00:07:51,TheBeckoner,I tan pretty easy
02-05-2018T00:07:55,TheBeckoner,heck
02-05-2018T00:07:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"To be fair, he likely tied his hair back"
02-05-2018T00:08:07,TheBeckoner,"my ""sunburn"" tans lol"
02-05-2018T00:08:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"I tan ok, but it’s hard to tan evenly with a top and bottom on"
02-05-2018T00:09:08,TheBeckoner,be naked
02-05-2018T00:09:10,TheBeckoner,easy

02-05-2018T00:09:32,TheBeckoner,hah
02-05-2018T00:09:49,Vatruvius,That is what my sister does sometimes. But that is easy to do when you live in a forest with many trees between you and neighbors.
02-05-2018T00:09:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, topless sunbathing is unwise in public"
02-05-2018T00:09:59,TheBeckoner,yeah
02-05-2018T00:10:02,TheBeckoner,I would think

02-05-2018T00:10:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"On your stomach, someone can steal your top out from under you"

02-05-2018T00:11:32,TheBeckoner,ha
02-05-2018T00:11:36,TheBeckoner,"""jenga"""
02-05-2018T00:11:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Some teens will. To get a chance to see boobs
02-05-2018T00:12:11,TheBeckoner,Become male and enjoy the male privilege of enjoying boob but not having boob
02-05-2018T00:12:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Unfortunately I can’t just grow a twig and berries
02-05-2018T00:12:40,Vatruvius,Wow...that is rather low.
02-05-2018T00:12:41,TheBeckoner,easy
02-05-2018T00:12:43,unsteddyphoenix,:T
02-05-2018T00:12:48,TheBeckoner,*cut off boob
02-05-2018T00:12:54,TheBeckoner,*plant nipple
02-05-2018T00:12:58,TheBeckoner,*done
02-05-2018T00:13:11,Vatruvius,Technically we men just grew a twig and berries from what would have been female reproductive organs.
02-05-2018T00:13:23,TheBeckoner,See Kiwi
02-05-2018T00:13:27,TheBeckoner,anything can happen
02-05-2018T00:13:49,SpazztasticKiwi,But I’m not in the womb. My chromosomes are already set as XX
02-05-2018T00:14:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve seen some people describe it as “your vagina falls out”
02-05-2018T00:14:37,Vatruvius,"Just sign up for genetic testing, we are bound to be close to switch the sex of an individual through their genes."
02-05-2018T00:14:49,Bgrmystr2,"xD Kiwi, I don't think those people know how bodies work."
02-05-2018T00:14:51,Vatruvius,Not even close but okay.
02-05-2018T00:14:51,Bgrmystr2,"like, at all."
02-05-2018T00:15:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"I like my boobs. As much as I’d like to go shirtless sometimes, boobs are too great to give up"
02-05-2018T00:15:53,TheBeckoner,How do they benefit?
02-05-2018T00:15:56,TheBeckoner,jw
02-05-2018T00:16:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I can touch boobs whenever I want and not get in trouble for it
02-05-2018T00:16:09,TheBeckoner,true
02-05-2018T00:16:15,unsteddyphoenix,good for filling out dresses
02-05-2018T00:16:23,unsteddyphoenix,https://imgur.com/IcNgyoK
02-05-2018T00:16:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t but thanks for the vote of confidence
02-05-2018T00:16:52,TheBeckoner,Awwwwwwww
02-05-2018T00:16:56,TheBeckoner,many cutes
02-05-2018T00:17:01,unsteddyphoenix,Better than nothing~
02-05-2018T00:17:10,unsteddyphoenix,relatable catte
02-05-2018T00:17:11,TheBeckoner,Im glad to see that the son was returned
02-05-2018T00:17:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to snuggle the cute
02-05-2018T00:18:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though on the subject of boobs and kittens, the kitten I have currently likes to curl up on my chest"
02-05-2018T00:18:35,unsteddyphoenix,Those are two great topics
02-05-2018T00:18:55,unsteddyphoenix,"And hey, another use for bobs"
02-05-2018T00:19:05,TheBeckoner,Im off to get saturated and shirtless
02-05-2018T00:19:18,TheBeckoner,I'll be back I think
02-05-2018T00:19:27,unsteddyphoenix,saturate your fat
02-05-2018T00:22:48,Vatruvius,What is a bobs unsteddy? :ptv-tease:
02-05-2018T00:23:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Small boobs
02-05-2018T00:24:11,Vatruvius,So Flora has bobs?
02-05-2018T00:24:27,Vatruvius,While Kat and Natani have boobs.
02-05-2018T00:24:44,SpazztasticKiwi,To be honest I think I’m about Flora’s size
02-05-2018T00:25:35,Vatruvius,Immediately downgrade my mental image of you. :ptv-victory:
02-05-2018T00:26:01,Vatruvius,Boob size does not matter that much to me.
02-05-2018T00:26:16,unsteddyphoenix,Could always be worse :ctwokinds-LauraCry:
02-05-2018T00:26:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Nice to know you immediately imagined me as very blessed :ptv-condescending:
02-05-2018T00:27:20,Vatruvius,lol
02-05-2018T00:27:53,SpazztasticKiwi,“I thought you’d be bigger”
02-05-2018T00:27:58,SpazztasticKiwi,“Yeah me too”
02-05-2018T00:27:58,Vatruvius,"I am certainly more of a personality person, but a gifted body does not hurt."
02-05-2018T00:28:09,SpazztasticKiwi,It can hurt
02-05-2018T00:29:01,SpazztasticKiwi,You run into something you hit it full-chested. Women have airbags with nerves
02-05-2018T00:30:10,Vatruvius,"Well, I meant it does not hurt for me or the individual in a relationship or potential relationship if they have an awesome personality and have a nice body."
02-05-2018T00:30:45,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s pretty true for most people
02-05-2018T00:30:56,Vatruvius,"One a side note, guys have a marble bag of pain."
02-05-2018T00:30:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Except trophy hunters
02-05-2018T00:31:05,Vatruvius,Meh...best analogy I could think of.
02-05-2018T00:31:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve heard some of the best euphemisms for that
02-05-2018T00:31:34,SpazztasticKiwi,“The Infinity Stones”
02-05-2018T00:31:49,SpazztasticKiwi,That ones my favorite
02-05-2018T00:31:56,Vatruvius,That would be a new one.
02-05-2018T00:32:48,Vatruvius,Problem is they are far too delicate compared to what the name is referencing. And they do not have any magical powers other than that which others call their function.
02-05-2018T00:32:55,Vatruvius,Or role in life if you will.
02-05-2018T00:33:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"For something that’s so delicate, I wonder why they’re left on the outside of the body"
02-05-2018T00:33:43,unsteddyphoenix,Sperm dies in heat
02-05-2018T00:34:02,unsteddyphoenix,"So if they were inside, the body heat would kill all the sperm cells"
02-05-2018T00:34:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I know they have to be a certain temperature to keep the little swimmers alive and viable but still
02-05-2018T00:34:25,unsteddyphoenix,Gotta stay cool~
02-05-2018T00:35:26,Vatruvius,"I do not notice its function other than that it is there. But unsteddy is right, scientifically it is so as too keep the sperm cells from dying to body heat."
02-05-2018T00:37:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Guys are in constant production. Girls are born with all we get
02-05-2018T00:38:05,Vatruvius,"That is true, it is rather interesting as well."
02-05-2018T00:38:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Plus we lose one every 28 days. Cause logic
02-05-2018T00:39:05,Vatruvius,"Just how much does the body produce then, how much are you born with? Is it a consistent amount or is based off your genes, so better genes allow more to be produced before birth."
02-05-2018T00:39:18,Vatruvius,The cycle of life Kiwi.
02-05-2018T00:40:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m pretty sure women are born with around a million or something eggs and men are literally always producing
02-05-2018T00:40:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"And if what you produce isn’t spent, it’s recycled or something I think"
02-05-2018T00:41:05,Vatruvius,Would not be surprised.
02-05-2018T00:41:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"Men are encouraged to spend, even if they’re not doing so with a woman because it’s said to encourage production"
02-05-2018T00:42:50,Vatruvius,"Maybe that is true, though I have no idea. Would make sense if that is part of our biology but I cannot say for certain. It seems like an odd evolutionary trait, have not seen it in other species at all."
02-05-2018T00:42:57,SpazztasticKiwi,But they also said slower sperm are male that don’t last as long while the faster is female
02-05-2018T00:43:04,Vatruvius,Though I suppose other species reproduce more often then we do.
02-05-2018T00:43:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"So if you take your time in bed, you’re supposedly more likely to have a boy"
02-05-2018T00:44:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"Thanks to learning that fact, I now see couples with kids differently. But I’m not sure if it has much merit"
02-05-2018T00:44:51,unsteddyphoenix,that...sounds like a myth
02-05-2018T00:45:00,Vatruvius,"I will keep that in mind, though I certainly never planned on having a fast bed experience."
02-05-2018T00:45:37,Vatruvius,Sounds a whole lot better than my sexist English teacher from high school.
02-05-2018T00:46:59,Vatruvius,"She complained how in literature and history men blamed women for not providing male heirs when all along apparently she read that what the male is thinking of, male or female heir, while ""reproducing"" is what actually effects weather you get a male or"
02-05-2018T00:47:02,Vatruvius,female child.
02-05-2018T00:47:05,Vatruvius,So stupid.
02-05-2018T00:47:59,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s plenty of facts that I wish I’d never learned. Some of them are probably more theory than fact though
02-05-2018T00:48:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"Yes because while in bed, you should be chanting “male, male, male”"
02-05-2018T00:48:35,Vatruvius,Probably.
02-05-2018T00:48:41,Vatruvius,lol
02-05-2018T00:50:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"The worst “fact” I heard is that male sperm whales, obviously due to size can’t do a traditional mating so they pump about 30 gallons of mini thems in the water in the hopes they fertilize a nearby female"
02-05-2018T00:50:36,SpazztasticKiwi,And you wonder why the sea is so salty
02-05-2018T00:50:52,Vatruvius,That is not why it is salty.
02-05-2018T00:50:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I suspect some of that is true but
02-05-2018T00:51:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Come on people
02-05-2018T00:51:15,Vatruvius,But most fish reproduce by releasing their sperm over eggs.
02-05-2018T00:51:57,SpazztasticKiwi,This reminds me...
02-05-2018T00:52:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I once had a little kid ask me when my fixed male dog was gonna have puppies and I’ve never had my mind panic so fast in my life
02-05-2018T00:53:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"The only thing I could think of was “go ask you mother”, but someone else answered for me"
02-05-2018T00:53:57,Vatruvius,That reminds me...plan out and settle on an explanation with my spouse for when the kids ask about sex and other topics.
02-05-2018T00:56:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember one day I was walking around with my boyfriend at the time with two of his young siblings
02-05-2018T00:57:06,SpazztasticKiwi,You could see the math going on in people’s heads as they held out hands
02-05-2018T00:57:10,SpazztasticKiwi,*our
02-05-2018T00:58:10,Vatruvius,"Wow, how old were you two then?"
02-05-2018T00:58:45,SpazztasticKiwi,18
02-05-2018T00:59:07,SpazztasticKiwi,But the brother and sister were 5 and 8
02-05-2018T00:59:23,Vatruvius,And people were doing math with that!?
02-05-2018T00:59:44,Vatruvius,Let's see here...ah...those two had sex in middle school!
02-05-2018T00:59:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"They looked like him, but were only listening to me"
02-05-2018T00:59:50,Vatruvius,I found the answer!
02-05-2018T01:00:49,SpazztasticKiwi,For some reason they were more likely to do what I asked than him despite him being their older brother
02-05-2018T01:02:31,Vatruvius,"Siblings do not like listening to each other so yeah, you were just this nice girl dating their older brother. Makes sense to me."
02-05-2018T01:03:01,SpazztasticKiwi,The little sister once asked me when I was gonna be her new sister
02-05-2018T01:03:42,SpazztasticKiwi,We both got a deer in headlights look
02-05-2018T01:03:51,Vatruvius,lol
02-05-2018T01:03:57,Vatruvius,Kids are too innocent.
02-05-2018T01:04:12,TheBeckoner,is now unsaturated
02-05-2018T01:04:57,Vatruvius,Good?
02-05-2018T01:04:59,TheBeckoner,"My sister seemed to be very fond of my last gf. Im not sure if thats just how it is tho. ""I like you because they like you"" sorta deal"
02-05-2018T01:06:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"This ex had two younger sisters and one younger brother. They all liked me, especially the 5 year old sister"
02-05-2018T01:06:23,Vatruvius,"Probably, though I do not know. I do not have siblings that young. Just my sister and she is younger than me by a little under two years."
02-05-2018T01:07:09,SpazztasticKiwi,He couldn’t understand why they listened to me so well
02-05-2018T01:07:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Or how I was so tolerant of them
02-05-2018T01:07:34,Vatruvius,lol
02-05-2018T01:07:51,Vatruvius,So a lot of dates baby sitting/getting them to do stuff that he couldn't?
02-05-2018T01:08:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"He could say “sit down” 100 times and they’d ignore him but once I said sit, they parked it"
02-05-2018T01:09:02,SpazztasticKiwi,And he’d just give me this look
02-05-2018T01:09:11,Vatruvius,And for some reason you do not want kids at any point in your future?
02-05-2018T01:09:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Not really no
02-05-2018T01:10:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I’d be equally important to find a guy that wants them at the same time and will help
02-05-2018T01:10:18,SpazztasticKiwi,*it’d
02-05-2018T01:10:34,Vatruvius,Is there are particular reason? It seems like you are good with them and kinda like it.
02-05-2018T01:11:06,Vatruvius,You mean you are put off of having kids because the guy won't help?
02-05-2018T01:11:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"I liked them, yes. But i didn’t physically have them or raise them"
02-05-2018T01:11:29,TheBeckoner,"I want kids, gf didnt. I kinda figured that would be a deal breaker for me, and it wouldve been I think"
02-05-2018T01:11:45,TheBeckoner,Steal a couple Kiwi
02-05-2018T01:12:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"Do keep in mind, if I have kids, I’m going to be the one pregnant for 9 months with all the symptoms that go with that"
02-05-2018T01:13:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"Another thing is that I’m old enough sure, but I’m a bit young to be worrying about my oven breaking down just yet"
02-05-2018T01:13:50,Vatruvius,"If I were in a relationship, having kids would be a planned thing. Even if it were an accident, it is a team effort. I would work my ass of for my spouse. I would do water I can to help her while at the same time prepare for a new set of feet in the house"
02-05-2018T01:14:23,Vatruvius,"Yeah, I do not plan on having kids for another 6ish years."
02-05-2018T01:14:32,Vatruvius,Still need to find a spouse too.
02-05-2018T01:14:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to make sure I find a good father first too
02-05-2018T01:15:05,Vatruvius,Yup...years of searching.
02-05-2018T01:15:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Being pregnant for the first time is one thing. Being alone and pregnant for the first time is another
02-05-2018T01:15:38,TheBeckoner,I aint lookin too hard yet
02-05-2018T01:15:45,TheBeckoner,oof
02-05-2018T01:15:57,TheBeckoner,no good being alone and pregnant
02-05-2018T01:16:27,Vatruvius,Some men can just be real asses.
02-05-2018T01:17:12,Vatruvius,Save yourself the trouble and pain you caused onto others and just buy an adult doll or something.
02-05-2018T01:18:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"Even if I do start dating someone again, so far the only way I’m getting pregnant is if something breaks"
02-05-2018T01:19:32,SpazztasticKiwi,And idk what I’ll do then cause my family will go postal if I’m pregnant and not married
02-05-2018T01:19:34,Vatruvius,True.
02-05-2018T01:19:48,Vatruvius,"Move, far away. Get a name change."
02-05-2018T01:20:15,Vatruvius,New Zealand is nice. Very pretty over there.
02-05-2018T01:20:22,Vatruvius,Beautiful landscapes.
02-05-2018T01:21:39,TheBeckoner,I'd do switzerland I think
02-05-2018T01:21:49,TheBeckoner,Maybe japan idk
02-05-2018T01:21:58,TheBeckoner,I like america so far
02-05-2018T01:22:01,TheBeckoner,soooo
02-05-2018T01:22:03,Vatruvius,"Not sure why this ever was a thought of mine, but it would concern me greatly if I did not want kids yet in the relationship however my spouse or what have you goes out of their way to sabotage any protective measure without talking to me."
02-05-2018T01:22:10,TheBeckoner,Im also american so maybe a bit of bias
02-05-2018T01:22:25,Vatruvius,I am a Californian.
02-05-2018T01:22:35,Vatruvius,Amazing sights here.
02-05-2018T01:22:36,TheBeckoner,Nocal or socal?
02-05-2018T01:22:41,Vatruvius,North.
02-05-2018T01:22:46,TheBeckoner,Hmmm
02-05-2018T01:22:55,TheBeckoner,I think Jay leno is up there
02-05-2018T01:22:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Sabotaging the protection without the partner’s consent or knowledge is considered rape due to new laws
02-05-2018T01:22:59,TheBeckoner,I dont recall
02-05-2018T01:23:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"Like if a guy opens a condom but doesn’t use it, he can be charged"
02-05-2018T01:23:47,Vatruvius,The rape part would the least of my concerns. There is a sever lack of communication going on.
02-05-2018T01:24:07,Vatruvius,would be the*
02-05-2018T01:24:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t rely on just the pill if she’s taking it either
02-05-2018T01:25:21,SpazztasticKiwi,It has a bigger fail rate than you think
02-05-2018T01:25:33,TheBeckoner,Hey y'all have fun talking about life and what not. Im gonna go ahead and go to bed. Night y'all.
02-05-2018T01:25:41,Vatruvius,Good night Beck.
02-05-2018T01:25:47,SpazztasticKiwi,✌🏻
02-05-2018T01:26:48,Vatruvius,"Maybe, though from my mother's experiences birth control comes with its problems too. The whole hormone thing and all, she found it very difficult to conceive me after getting of. Took months apparently."
02-05-2018T01:27:05,Vatruvius,off*
02-05-2018T01:27:33,SpazztasticKiwi,It restructures the hormone balance and production. That’s what makes it effective
02-05-2018T01:28:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"And if you don’t take it every day at the exact same time, failure can increase from 1% to 8%"
02-05-2018T01:29:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"Not alot, but notable when you’re talking about making a baby"
02-05-2018T01:29:44,Vatruvius,"I know it does something to the regular hormone cycle women goes through to prevent pregnancy but I do not think the science behind the long term effects are well known. I mean, regular use of a condom seems fine but I am sure such details will be worked"
02-05-2018T01:29:50,Vatruvius,out in the relationship.
02-05-2018T01:30:13,Vatruvius,go*
02-05-2018T01:30:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Side effects are weight gain and depression most commonly. It’s theorized that birth control increases your risk of miscarriage once you do start trying though
02-05-2018T01:31:04,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s not been officially proven
02-05-2018T01:32:40,Vatruvius,"But I do feel that messing with the hormones of the human body is a dangerous thing. Hormones and the brain are linked together, we barely understand the brain and how hormones really effect the body. We know some but not all so I think it should be best"
02-05-2018T01:32:44,Vatruvius,left untouched.
02-05-2018T01:33:03,Vatruvius,"I am a natural guy to, organic foods and all that stuff."
02-05-2018T01:33:07,Vatruvius,too*
02-05-2018T01:33:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Birth control is essential for some women though
02-05-2018T01:34:01,Vatruvius,"Maybe, I do not know. I am curious if there is a more natural way to prevent pregnancies that do not involve chemical manipulations."
02-05-2018T01:34:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Anemics and those with ovarian cysts need to regulate their cycles or risk hospital stay or death
02-05-2018T01:34:10,Vatruvius,Or a more natural way in general.
02-05-2018T01:34:27,Vatruvius,"Yeah, that seems like a must."
02-05-2018T01:35:30,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s a feminine condom but it’s not widely sold
02-05-2018T01:37:19,Vatruvius,"I saw those during a sex ed thing in college. They described them and such, seems like more of a pain than a male condom. I mean, you have to reach in and...just looks painful compared to what a guy can do. Unless they refined the application method."
02-05-2018T01:37:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m pretty sure I’ll stick to celibacy until I find someone worth it/I’m ready anyway. Sex isn’t required for a relationship
02-05-2018T01:38:40,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s not terribly painful if you do it right. Do keep in mind women can push another human being out of that canal. A female condom isn’t going to be much more difficult
02-05-2018T01:39:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Especially if you use a gel to get it in place. Or have experience with tampons
02-05-2018T01:39:24,Vatruvius,"True, but like the first birth I would assume if would be hard the first time."
02-05-2018T01:40:09,Vatruvius,"What are you talking about Kiwi, relationships are only about the sex! :ptv-tease:"
02-05-2018T01:40:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Then I’ve got some bad news for the next guy I date
02-05-2018T01:40:50,Vatruvius,lol
02-05-2018T01:40:53,Bgrmystr2,Kiwi presuming guys want anything in a date but sex :vvvvv
02-05-2018T01:40:58,Bgrmystr2,bad news for kiwi
02-05-2018T01:41:29,Bgrmystr2,"also, semi-back"
02-05-2018T01:41:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Literally 99% of the guys I’ve met so far have had that one their mind within the first few interactions
02-05-2018T01:41:45,SpazztasticKiwi,*on
02-05-2018T01:42:03,Bgrmystr2,well yeah a lot of guys are dumb and only want sex and then run off
02-05-2018T01:42:14,Bgrmystr2,"shitty, the lot of em"
02-05-2018T01:42:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I believe the correct terminology is “fuckboy”
02-05-2018T01:42:35,Bgrmystr2,neh
02-05-2018T01:42:43,Bgrmystr2,Won't be using that.
02-05-2018T01:42:57,Bgrmystr2,I don't use trash terminology :V
02-05-2018T01:43:21,Vatruvius,"Yeah, take a certain state of mind, personality, and/or maturity to want more than sex out of a relationship."
02-05-2018T01:43:40,Bgrmystr2,and it's not that much maturity either
02-05-2018T01:43:58,Vatruvius,Would you guys like to watch a funny video on a guy who does voices?
02-05-2018T01:44:02,Bgrmystr2,pity that so many people lack the ability to reach even that low of a level lol
02-05-2018T01:44:15,Bgrmystr2,I'm busy watchin anime. Meh :v
02-05-2018T01:44:22,Vatruvius,It does kinda relate to this topic but mostly is funny.
02-05-2018T01:44:30,Vatruvius,Kiwi?
02-05-2018T01:44:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Sure
02-05-2018T01:46:06,Vatruvius,One sec...
02-05-2018T01:46:49,Vatruvius,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z08lo7uOd-o
02-05-2018T01:47:10,Vatruvius,"I love this guy, he does a great job. I think he does like 9+ voices now."
02-05-2018T01:51:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve seen alot of people do voice mimics
02-05-2018T01:51:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Thomas does some Family Guy impressions
02-05-2018T01:52:44,Dadrobit,"Oof, I'm getting some gnarly 1984 vibes from that last conversation."
02-05-2018T01:53:15,Vatruvius,Well was not born for more than a decade after 1984 so I wouldn't know.
02-05-2018T01:53:29,Vatruvius,Did you watch the full video Kiwi?
02-05-2018T01:53:46,Dadrobit,shudders
02-05-2018T01:53:50,Vatruvius,"Azerrz does a Cleveland voice too. It is really good, check out his Cleveland playlist."
02-05-2018T01:53:58,Dadrobit,1984 is a book that you need to read.
02-05-2018T01:54:10,Dadrobit,Was mandatory literature back when I was in school.
02-05-2018T01:54:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Wasn’t for me
02-05-2018T01:54:27,Dadrobit,Scary
02-05-2018T01:54:46,Vatruvius,Kinda don't want to.
02-05-2018T01:54:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"We read To Kill a Mockingbird, The Count of Monte Cristo, and The Great Gatsby"
02-05-2018T01:55:00,Vatruvius,"Bummer, I get a good laugh out of his stuff though."
02-05-2018T01:55:34,Vatruvius,"Gatsby, Mockingbird, Of Mice and Men, Lord of the Flies"
02-05-2018T01:55:50,Vatruvius,A lot of Shakespeare.
02-05-2018T01:55:52,SpazztasticKiwi,We had Of Mice and Men too
02-05-2018T01:56:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Skipped LotF though
02-05-2018T01:56:20,SpazztasticKiwi,And Scarlet Letter
02-05-2018T01:56:31,Dadrobit,"1984 is a warning. A book written by George Orwell in 1949 cautioning against the dystopian ""future"" of 1984."
02-05-2018T01:56:43,Vatruvius,I see.
02-05-2018T01:56:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Somebody’s gotta tel him
02-05-2018T01:57:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"“George, it’s 2018”"
02-05-2018T01:57:38,Vatruvius,"Lord of the Flies was really bad, hated that book. And my English teacher assigned us to read it over Christmas break. She wanted the whole book read by the time we got back. Who assigns a book like Lord of the Flies over Christmas!?"
02-05-2018T01:58:03,Dadrobit,"Where government surveillance is nonstop and nearly omnipresent. War is perpetual. And the people are controlled by the ""Thought Police""."
02-05-2018T01:59:04,SpazztasticKiwi,You know the book “F. 451” has been republished with a new cover that comes with a match inside and a spine that can light the match
02-05-2018T01:59:26,SpazztasticKiwi,So you can burn the book when you’re done
02-05-2018T01:59:48,Dadrobit,"Part of that control is maintained through the use of the ""Anti Sex League"" where people are essentially forbidden from sex. Celibacy is the mandate and any sexual engagements by the people are generally only done with ""disgust""."
02-05-2018T02:00:07,Vatruvius,"Interesting. They are coming out with a TV series on the book, it looks really good compared to past movie/tv adaptations of books."
02-05-2018T02:00:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I want that copy just as a collector’s item
02-05-2018T02:00:37,Vatruvius,Noping out of that read. Thanks Dadro.
02-05-2018T02:00:37,Dadrobit,To actually enjoy sex is frowned upon.
02-05-2018T02:00:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Do..do they not know how humans work?
02-05-2018T02:01:09,Dadrobit,The only thought or emotions that are allowed are administered through the media.
02-05-2018T02:01:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d die
02-05-2018T02:01:41,Dadrobit,You all are very much reminding me of that book with your earlier comments about sex.
02-05-2018T02:02:09,Dadrobit,"How it's not necessary for a good relationship and that to actively seek it out is ""immature""."
02-05-2018T02:02:33,Dadrobit,Just sayin'.
02-05-2018T02:02:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m just not a believer in one night stands
02-05-2018T02:03:11,Dadrobit,"Orwell might have been off by about 40 years, but shit's scary to see irl."
02-05-2018T02:03:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m too paranoid about getting pregnant on accident
02-05-2018T02:04:03,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh yeah the 1984 thing
02-05-2018T02:04:07,Bgrmystr2,Someone thinking only about sex and then dropping the girl while she deals with the pregnancy is literally defined by immaturity
02-05-2018T02:04:12,unsteddyphoenix,I watched a plot summary of the book
02-05-2018T02:04:26,unsteddyphoenix,Wasnt that book banned in some places or whatever?
02-05-2018T02:04:33,Vatruvius,"Admittedly that is not my concern, but I would make sure she felt comfortable in what we were doing. I would carry proper protection."
02-05-2018T02:04:40,Dadrobit,"It's a great read. Sad, but very memorable."
02-05-2018T02:05:17,Dadrobit,"If it was banned, that's legitimately terrifying..."
02-05-2018T02:06:32,Vatruvius,What was that one book about farm animals where it was mimicking the Soviet Union and communism?
02-05-2018T02:06:59,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah it's been banned on and off over history
02-05-2018T02:07:14,unsteddyphoenix,Including idaho in 2017...huh
02-05-2018T02:07:22,unsteddyphoenix,You mean...Animal Farm?
02-05-2018T02:07:57,Vatruvius,That sounds right.
02-05-2018T02:08:26,Dadrobit,It was banned in the USSR.
02-05-2018T02:08:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"Click here to confirm: It is good advice to always carry one or two in you wallet, but be sure to replace themem after a month. They can start deteriorating"
02-05-2018T02:08:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Ignore that first part
02-05-2018T02:09:04,Dadrobit,And Amazon accidentally deleted both 1984 and Animal Farm in 2009.
02-05-2018T02:09:14,Dadrobit,From their catalog.
02-05-2018T02:09:22,Bgrmystr2,"""accidentally"""
02-05-2018T02:09:22,Vatruvius,Interesting.
02-05-2018T02:09:31,Bgrmystr2,"if they didn't return it, then it wasn't an accident."
02-05-2018T02:09:52,Vatruvius,So much for my box of condoms then...they are certainly older than a month.
02-05-2018T02:10:12,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s just a precaution
02-05-2018T02:10:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"The more you can do to be the safest, the better"
02-05-2018T02:10:57,Dadrobit,It was taken down because the seller they were using to get the books were not authorized to actually sell them.
02-05-2018T02:11:05,SpazztasticKiwi,But be careful - some people could take it as you being expectant that something will happen
02-05-2018T02:11:20,Bgrmystr2,doesn't sound like it was removed by accident then :thinking:
02-05-2018T02:11:27,Vatruvius,"I remember from middle school how stupid it seemed to me that all the other boys were buying condoms and talking about what kind they got, as if they were going to get laid in the 7th grade."
02-05-2018T02:11:38,Dadrobit,Can confirm that they do now sell them both again.
02-05-2018T02:11:45,Bgrmystr2,"ah, there ya go then"
02-05-2018T02:11:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I had a friend that got his girlfriend pregnant in 7th grade
02-05-2018T02:12:14,Vatruvius,:ptv-shock:
02-05-2018T02:12:48,SpazztasticKiwi,He now has a daughter
02-05-2018T02:13:07,Dadrobit,"Also, Idaho has not banned the book either (thankfully). But it's a very popular target for schools to challenge to remove from their libraries."
02-05-2018T02:13:18,Vatruvius,"A daughter, barely started high school, and not much of a future."
02-05-2018T02:13:20,SpazztasticKiwi,She’s about 10 or 11 this year
02-05-2018T02:13:25,unsteddyphoenix,Hmm...
02-05-2018T02:13:42,Vatruvius,Just all around bad.
02-05-2018T02:13:44,unsteddyphoenix,"Ah, it was just under scrutiny, mb."
02-05-2018T02:13:54,unsteddyphoenix,"Why add it to the list then website, jeez."
02-05-2018T02:14:15,Dadrobit,"Also, yeah, junior high pregnancies happen all too often. My mother taught science at the junior high level for a few years, and every year she'd get a few pregnant girls."
02-05-2018T02:14:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Scratch that - she’s about 8
02-05-2018T02:14:45,unsteddyphoenix,gross
02-05-2018T02:15:01,Dadrobit,"Super low income area, also had a lot of gang violence."
02-05-2018T02:15:16,Dadrobit,Kids couldn't wear solid colors anymore it got so bad.
02-05-2018T02:15:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"Abstinence is preached where I live, but it doesn’t work"
02-05-2018T02:15:36,Dadrobit,Never does.
02-05-2018T02:16:19,Vatruvius,Problem is here in the US sex is one of those topics you do not really talk about at the dinner table or at all really so informing youth about proper protection is missed.
02-05-2018T02:16:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"While it’s understandable to follow, the heat of the moment burns away good thinking"
02-05-2018T02:17:12,Dadrobit,"Thankfully, sex was a dinner table topic of sorts when I grew up."
02-05-2018T02:17:18,Vatruvius,I remember my middle school made us do the artificial baby doll thing where you had to take care of them to let you know how horrible taking care of kids are but that was a total failure. It was really dumb.
02-05-2018T02:17:23,SpazztasticKiwi,And since sex ed isn’t a big thing and nor is the concept of protection...
02-05-2018T02:18:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Guys are more likely to get the talk than girls. Girls are just told don’t think about it until you’re married
02-05-2018T02:18:31,Dadrobit,"At least we talked about it in jest. When my father actually gave me ""the talk"" it was just ""double wrap that weasel boy!"" and he tossed me a box of condoms."
02-05-2018T02:18:57,unsteddyphoenix,doesnt double wrapping give a higher chance of breakage?
02-05-2018T02:19:04,Vatruvius,"I think this goes for every guy, after he commits the act of ""reproduction"" weather it be for real or by hand, he will suddenly become very wise for a couple minutes and realize how stupid of a thing they just did."
02-05-2018T02:19:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Double wrapping can cause them to come off more easily and doubles breakage risk
02-05-2018T02:19:19,Dadrobit,"Hell if I know, never actually did."
02-05-2018T02:19:23,unsteddyphoenix,lol what vat
02-05-2018T02:19:42,Dadrobit,"Vat, you might have some guilt issues mate."
02-05-2018T02:19:44,unsteddyphoenix,I see what Dad means
02-05-2018T02:20:23,Dadrobit,See? I'm not paranoid!
02-05-2018T02:20:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Guys are given boxes of condoms from their dads. Girls are taught to run at the sight of one
02-05-2018T02:20:28,Vatruvius,"It is a common thing among guys. So common that jokes are made about it, no need for an explanation obviously."
02-05-2018T02:20:48,unsteddyphoenix,If it's a joke I dont think you told it right lmao
02-05-2018T02:21:14,Vatruvius,My dad never gave me the talk. Only thing he told me when I was young was that masturbating will make me blind.
02-05-2018T02:21:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"If we could teach girls a dick isn’t gonna nite them, it might help. Even the knowledge field"
02-05-2018T02:21:29,SpazztasticKiwi,*bite
02-05-2018T02:21:37,Vatruvius,"Ended up buying condoms with my mom of all people, a surprise purchase, before I left for college."
02-05-2018T02:22:09,Vatruvius,"I was not telling a joke, but jokes are made fun about the ""moment of wisdom"" often enough."
02-05-2018T02:22:44,Vatruvius,Did not need the mental image Kiwi.
02-05-2018T02:22:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Not entirely sure I know what you’re referencing and I don’t think I want to
02-05-2018T02:23:58,Vatruvius,More of a guy thing though seems like I am alone in this chat.
02-05-2018T02:24:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"From what I’ve heard, girls are supposed to stay virgins, and guys aren’t."
02-05-2018T02:24:32,SpazztasticKiwi,So is society telling guys to do themselves?
02-05-2018T02:24:34,Vatruvius,That can't work.
02-05-2018T02:24:54,unsteddyphoenix,No its saying for guys to do each other
02-05-2018T02:24:56,unsteddyphoenix,Obviously
02-05-2018T02:25:13,Vatruvius,People are blaming gays when all along they should have been blaming the system.
02-05-2018T02:25:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Can’t have your cake and eat it too
02-05-2018T02:25:54,unsteddyphoenix,"And I know what youre meaning vat, but that doesnt mean all sex is ""stupid"""
02-05-2018T02:26:39,Vatruvius,"I am not saying it is stupid, just that there is this moment of wisdom. In some situation, it is really stupid."
02-05-2018T02:26:51,Vatruvius,situations*
02-05-2018T02:27:07,Dadrobit,Big Brother
02-05-2018T02:29:01,SpazztasticKiwi,What I find weird is when there’s a nude girl shown in a video or picture for something like anatomy lessons or something and people act like it’s impossible for anyone to have seen something like that before
02-05-2018T02:30:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"I live with the understanding that if the guy I’m talking to is at least 18, he’s seen boobs before"
02-05-2018T02:31:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"Not counting the way advertising works, it’s very easy to “happen upon” such images"
02-05-2018T02:31:14,Vatruvius,"Right, but guys are made out to be pervs if they look at a naked girl. So society has taught us to be shocked and look away."
02-05-2018T02:31:44,Vatruvius,Referring to images even in a classroom.
02-05-2018T02:33:14,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s a difference in inrest and respectful observation from leering
02-05-2018T02:33:22,SpazztasticKiwi,*intrest
02-05-2018T02:33:55,SpazztasticKiwi,But I know what you’re talking about
02-05-2018T02:34:36,Vatruvius,"It is a shame really. It is all a shame how ads make women feel about their bodies, men too but to a lesser degree."
02-05-2018T02:34:54,Vatruvius,"also* not ""all a"""
02-05-2018T02:35:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Not just ads. Just seeing other girls in public can be depressing
02-05-2018T02:35:43,Vatruvius,"I guess so, my sister would be one of those people Kiwi."
02-05-2018T02:35:59,Vatruvius,Naturally always thing.
02-05-2018T02:36:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"Like I’ve said before, I follow a lot of girls and guys with girlfriends online that make me want to just bury myself"
02-05-2018T02:36:30,Vatruvius,Aw...don't do that. I am sure you are a beautiful person. Both on the outside and in.
02-05-2018T02:37:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Ever seen Mark or Jack’s girlfriends?
02-05-2018T02:37:53,SpazztasticKiwi,breathtaking
02-05-2018T02:38:10,Vatruvius,"Girlfriends plural? Not really, we talked about Amy before but I am not much of a social media person, like, at all pretty much."
02-05-2018T02:38:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Jacksepticeye
02-05-2018T02:38:32,Vatruvius,I know who you meant by Jack.
02-05-2018T02:38:45,Vatruvius,I don't live under that big of a rock.
02-05-2018T02:39:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Jack’s with a girl named Signe. I met her at PAX. She’s so lovely and sweet
02-05-2018T02:40:11,Vatruvius,Good for him.
02-05-2018T02:40:24,SpazztasticKiwi,And everyone I met that saw Mark and Amy said Amy is an angel
02-05-2018T02:41:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn’t get to met them but I did see them walking by at one point. She’s beautiful
02-05-2018T02:41:35,Vatruvius,I know for me I am not attracted to girls too thin. Even if it is a healthy thin. For the most part it is about the proportions.
02-05-2018T02:42:20,Vatruvius,I can care less how thin a women's waist can be.
02-05-2018T02:42:34,Vatruvius,It is not a competition of lowest number.
02-05-2018T02:42:43,Vatruvius,Not for me anyway. That just sickens me.
02-05-2018T02:45:39,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s also Pewdiepie and CinnamonToastKen’s gf and wife
02-05-2018T02:45:48,zolstarym,"If you can care less about it, then that implies that your caring is above 0"
02-05-2018T02:46:15,zolstarym,Meaning you do care about it
02-05-2018T02:46:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Ken’s wife Mary had a baby and she’s still just as lovely
02-05-2018T02:47:19,zolstarym,Also societies preferences change over time. Back a few centuries it was the opposite
02-05-2018T02:47:28,SpazztasticKiwi,And Felix got engaged recently to a girl that has been offered modeling opportunities
02-05-2018T02:47:46,Vatruvius,"Right, but how thin a girl is compared to the media's ideal image of a girl is my least concern or point to focus on zolstar"
02-05-2018T02:50:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I know I’m not fat but I also can’t wear what they do
02-05-2018T02:51:54,SpazztasticKiwi,It has come to my attention recently that my town’s Mayfest might be the same time as MomoCon
02-05-2018T02:52:34,Vatruvius,"I see, and that is a problem for you?"
02-05-2018T02:53:14,zolstarym,"back in times when food wasn't guaranteed, being plump was seen as a sign of wealth, because you were basically saying that you were better off than others becasue you had money to spare on food"
02-05-2018T02:53:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"Unfortunately I have no ride to get to MomoCon, as much as I want to go, so not really"
02-05-2018T02:54:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d forgotten about Mayfest until the preparations started and the carnival came into town
02-05-2018T02:54:40,Vatruvius,"That is true zol, but we not a couple centuries in the past. Food is so abundant that that mentality has switched."
02-05-2018T02:58:43,zolstarym,I think it is also true for men. How often do you see sixpack abs on tv/movies?
02-05-2018T02:59:29,zolstarym,to be able to see muscle like that usually means unhealthily low body fat %
02-05-2018T02:59:46,Dadrobit,"And if they are chubby, generally they're relegated to ""comic relief"""
02-05-2018T03:00:23,zolstarym,same with any model/actress where you can see bones/ribcage
02-05-2018T03:00:30,Vatruvius,"That is true. Like I said earlier, the media makes both feel bad about their bodies. I just think to men a lesser degree than women."
02-05-2018T03:00:34,Dadrobit,Fair point: The same can hold true for chubby women in the media.
02-05-2018T03:01:10,Dadrobit,"Though the chubby girl can also often be the ""empowered"" character. Generally not true for guys."
02-05-2018T03:02:01,Vatruvius,There was Mall Cop.
02-05-2018T03:02:21,Dadrobit,Mall Cop? Dude was entirely comic relief.
02-05-2018T03:02:35,Vatruvius,That is true.
02-05-2018T03:02:43,Vatruvius,Hmm...
02-05-2018T03:05:20,Vatruvius,"I cannot think of a single movie with empowered male characters that are not ripped. Maybe thin, but still fit."
02-05-2018T03:06:44,Dadrobit,Spoiler for Infinity War: They even had a moment of making fun of one of the characters for having the barest presence of a second chin.
02-05-2018T03:07:15,Vatruvius,"I vaguely remember that, but yes."
02-05-2018T03:09:30,zolstarym,did any of you like infinity war? I have heard mixed reviews
02-05-2018T03:10:04,Vatruvius,It is really good in a twisted way. That is all I am saying.
02-05-2018T03:10:13,Vatruvius,Hater gonna hate.
02-05-2018T03:10:17,Vatruvius,Haters*
02-05-2018T03:10:57,Dadrobit,I personally loved it. But I can see why people would dislike it.
02-05-2018T03:11:57,Vatruvius,"The reaction of some of the people in the audience was a bit too much in my opinion. In my head I was like, ""just die already and let use listen to the movie."""
02-05-2018T03:12:14,Vatruvius,us*
02-05-2018T03:12:30,zolstarym,"I heard mixed reviews for last jedi as well, but ended up liking some of what everyone else seemed to hate. mostly about luke's character"
02-05-2018T03:13:41,Vatruvius,"Mixed bag all of that. I tend to not listen to reviews and just go to movies I think will be interesting. If it is bad it is bad, if it is good it is good. If you like the Marvel movies at all, like any of them, you need to watch this film."
02-05-2018T03:13:58,Vatruvius,"However, if you have missed any of the other marvel films, watch them before you watch this one."
02-05-2018T03:15:08,zolstarym,the audience's reactions is usually why I just wait until home release
02-05-2018T03:15:41,zolstarym,when watching a new hope at the theater it was like the movie had a laugh track added to it
02-05-2018T03:17:10,Vatruvius,"It was not that bad, but definitely the most reactive I have heard from any movie I have attended. Granted, I watch Infinity War a day after release where most other films I watch two weeks after release so most of that ""lout"" crowd had already passed."
02-05-2018T03:17:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"When we went to see Rampage, there was this one guy in front of us that Kept. Using. His. Phone."
02-05-2018T03:17:43,Vatruvius,Did you kick his chair? Accidentally spill your popcorn on him? Spill your drink a little?
02-05-2018T03:18:38,unsteddyphoenix,"Endless combat was pretty good, and I dont even like superhero movies"
02-05-2018T03:18:53,unsteddyphoenix,Though there was a couple next to me who was laughing at Peter Dinklage
02-05-2018T03:19:11,unsteddyphoenix,Which made me really irrationally angry and totally pulled me out of the moment. :/
02-05-2018T03:21:09,SpazztasticKiwi,O much prefer sitting with friends or a special someone and doing a movie night than going out
02-05-2018T03:21:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Too much risk of stupid going to the theater
02-05-2018T03:21:40,unsteddyphoenix,Plus $$$
02-05-2018T03:21:51,zolstarym,and you can pause it at will
02-05-2018T03:21:54,SpazztasticKiwi,(And you can snuggle)
02-05-2018T03:22:10,SpazztasticKiwi,And food doesn’t cost an arm and a leg
02-05-2018T03:22:24,zolstarym,you have to be lucky enough to have someone though
02-05-2018T03:22:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Tru
02-05-2018T03:22:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve watched horror movies with my cat before
02-05-2018T03:23:24,SpazztasticKiwi,He slept through “Mirrors” and “Mirrors 2”
02-05-2018T03:23:41,zolstarym,I watched a dogs purpose with my dog. She went crazy wanting to play with every dog she saw on screen
02-05-2018T03:24:36,Vatruvius,"As much as I want to keep talking, I got to get up in 6 hours and get ready for school."
02-05-2018T03:24:46,SpazztasticKiwi,👍🏻
02-05-2018T03:24:49,Vatruvius,Bye everyone! :ptv-greetings: Catch you guys later.
02-05-2018T03:24:51,SpazztasticKiwi,👋🏻
02-05-2018T03:25:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I need to go to bed too
02-05-2018T03:25:19,Dadrobit,Cya
02-05-2018T03:25:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Not tired though
02-05-2018T03:25:30,Dadrobit,And I think I'm finally done with my final project...
02-05-2018T03:25:42,unsteddyphoenix,nice!
02-05-2018T03:26:02,Vatruvius,I just climbed into bed and I got tired Kiwi so maybe give that a try? Turn off lights or whatever.
02-05-2018T03:26:13,Vatruvius,Bye for reals!
02-05-2018T03:26:45,Dadrobit,Mind giving some feedback unsteddy?
02-05-2018T03:27:03,unsteddyphoenix,"Sure, hit me with that sneak peek"
02-05-2018T03:27:22,Dadrobit,Lemme upload it real quick.
02-05-2018T03:31:22,Dadrobit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b17WkwUkwPg&feature=youtu.be
02-05-2018T03:31:40,Dadrobit,Headphones or decent speakers preferable.
02-05-2018T03:34:49,unsteddyphoenix,Did you make the foley yourself?
02-05-2018T03:35:03,unsteddyphoenix,If you did it's very impressive
02-05-2018T03:35:45,Dadrobit,"A lot of it I did, some I took from our school library."
02-05-2018T03:37:58,Dadrobit,"Not 100% on it, but I'm kind of burnt out on working on it anymore."
02-05-2018T03:38:30,unsteddyphoenix,"Lol, I know that feel."
02-05-2018T03:39:17,Dadrobit,Looking at the same 2 minutes and 30 seconds over and over again all semester long.
02-05-2018T03:39:20,Bgrmystr2,"that wasn't bad, dadro"
02-05-2018T03:39:33,Dadrobit,\o/ The bar has been set!
02-05-2018T03:39:49,Bgrmystr2,"I liked it, honestly"
02-05-2018T03:39:54,Bgrmystr2,"I don't know the original sounds, but"
02-05-2018T03:39:54,unsteddyphoenix,"It's really good, idk how nitpicky you want me to be but"
02-05-2018T03:40:00,Dadrobit,Thanks kindly.
02-05-2018T03:40:10,Bgrmystr2,I wouldn't actually expect anything less from the official release.
02-05-2018T03:40:15,Bgrmystr2,So take that as you will.
02-05-2018T03:40:29,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah I thought that too, I could see it passing as legit"
02-05-2018T03:40:47,Dadrobit,"Awwww, thanks."
02-05-2018T03:40:51,Bgrmystr2,the only thing I think was questionable was at the beginning before the gate was opened
02-05-2018T03:41:04,Bgrmystr2,it sounded a bit lacklustre for people preparing for battle
02-05-2018T03:41:20,Bgrmystr2,"just with everyone there and all the sounds, I dunno"
02-05-2018T03:41:43,unsteddyphoenix,"Getting convincing voice acting is hard, my lecturers let that kind of thing slide"
02-05-2018T03:41:48,Bgrmystr2,"but I don't know what kind of stuff you had to work with, so it's alright"
02-05-2018T03:41:52,Bgrmystr2,yeah
02-05-2018T03:42:32,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I actually hate that tbh. It sounds like it came out of a bar."
02-05-2018T03:42:43,unsteddyphoenix,At like 1:34 theres a sound effect of blade-on-blade when I think the sword is hitting the wood of axes
02-05-2018T03:42:54,Bgrmystr2,that was the only thing I felt could have been better. Rest of it seemed like pretty good.
02-05-2018T03:42:57,Bgrmystr2,Was there?
02-05-2018T03:43:02,Dadrobit,"Kept on meaning to change it, but never put in the time to record something better."
02-05-2018T03:43:30,Bgrmystr2,"oh yeah phoenix, you're right"
02-05-2018T03:44:01,Bgrmystr2,What actually impresses me the most is the explosion at the end at 2:10
02-05-2018T03:44:12,Bgrmystr2,"holyshit, I could feel it w/ the ass of my chair"
02-05-2018T03:44:22,Bgrmystr2,that was nice
02-05-2018T03:44:27,Dadrobit,"Well damn, that is a wood on metal clunk."
02-05-2018T03:45:05,Bgrmystr2,"whatever you did to make that sound echo, it made my subs purr somethin nice"
02-05-2018T03:45:42,unsteddyphoenix,In general the blade sfx levels might be sliightly loud for my tastes?  that and the slomo at 1:40
02-05-2018T03:45:43,Dadrobit,"High cut, low boost, reverb for days."
02-05-2018T03:45:54,unsteddyphoenix,"I vaguely remember the original trailer being loud too though, so that might just be me"
02-05-2018T03:46:35,unsteddyphoenix,This has to be an A already though.
02-05-2018T03:46:45,Bgrmystr2,"the blades did seem a little bit loud, but I don't know if that's actually inaccurate to what real swords would sound like. I mean, I've seen movies and stuff, but I don't trust the sound levels to not be edited in them"
02-05-2018T03:46:48,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I thought it was kinda loud in the mix, but they are super loud sounds irl."
02-05-2018T03:47:10,unsteddyphoenix,I can imagine
02-05-2018T03:47:12,Bgrmystr2,"yeh agree w/ phoenix, definitely passes as official material imo"
02-05-2018T03:47:30,Bgrmystr2,Well done
02-05-2018T03:47:38,Dadrobit,"Like, I and the guy next to me spent a few minutes in the studio recording a lot of those hits and our ears were nearly bleeding fairly immediately."
02-05-2018T03:48:10,Bgrmystr2,:/
02-05-2018T03:48:13,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
02-05-2018T03:48:20,Bgrmystr2,Appreciate your sacrifice.
02-05-2018T03:48:27,Bgrmystr2,[/phoenixism
02-05-2018T03:49:02,Dadrobit,nice
02-05-2018T03:49:17,unsteddyphoenix,"I remember my lecturer saying the levels should never go above ""0"""
02-05-2018T03:49:24,unsteddyphoenix,Which...made sense in context I think
02-05-2018T03:49:40,unsteddyphoenix,Negative numbers were involved my memory is hazy
02-05-2018T03:50:23,unsteddyphoenix,How long did this take? Semester?
02-05-2018T03:50:27,Dadrobit,Going above 0 is just called clipping.
02-05-2018T03:50:33,unsteddyphoenix,or two
02-05-2018T03:50:39,Dadrobit,"And yeah, this was a semester long project."
02-05-2018T03:50:56,Dadrobit,I think I probably will place 2nd in the class tbh.
02-05-2018T03:51:08,unsteddyphoenix,very nice :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
02-05-2018T03:51:08,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: what's gonna be the first?
02-05-2018T03:51:16,Dadrobit,There's a dude behind me named Jeff that's goddamned incredible.
02-05-2018T03:51:19,Bgrmystr2,"and yeah, well deserved"
02-05-2018T03:51:45,Bgrmystr2,what's he done w/ his?
02-05-2018T03:51:47,Bgrmystr2,do you know?
02-05-2018T03:51:57,Bgrmystr2,or are you not supposed to know till you reveal it?
02-05-2018T03:52:08,Dadrobit,"He's kind of an idiot savant to this kind of stuff. He's super weird, almost not all there, but dedicated as all get out and makes really crazy good work."
02-05-2018T03:52:39,Dadrobit,"Naw, we all collaborate."
02-05-2018T03:52:46,Dadrobit,He did a WoW trailer.
02-05-2018T03:53:02,Dadrobit,Lemme upload it real quick.
02-05-2018T03:53:22,Dadrobit,I did the vox for him and helped him out with his general mixing.
02-05-2018T03:53:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I just saw a video where this grown woman is getting arrested for not posting bail
02-05-2018T03:54:01,SpazztasticKiwi,She promptly starts throwing a fit and asking where her dad is
02-05-2018T03:54:24,SpazztasticKiwi,God bless the poor officer. He was trying so hard
02-05-2018T03:56:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Also that sample vid was pretty good. I’m no expert on sound or video though. At least it was all on time

02-05-2018T03:57:32,Dadrobit,The guy composed the music himself. Only a few samples weren't recorded in the studio.
02-05-2018T03:57:41,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao I was about to praise the voice then I remembered it was you
02-05-2018T03:58:29,Dadrobit,lol
02-05-2018T04:00:53,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah this is like, perfect"
02-05-2018T04:01:01,Bgrmystr2,"I'm actually not as impressed at that one as I was with yours. The sound effects themselves were amazing, but the voice had almost no depth"
02-05-2018T04:01:15,Bgrmystr2,and I know you can add it post-recording
02-05-2018T04:01:19,Bgrmystr2,but it wasn't there
02-05-2018T04:02:40,SpazztasticKiwi,THAT IS YOUR VOICE???
02-05-2018T04:02:46,Bgrmystr2,xD Kiwi
02-05-2018T04:02:49,Dadrobit,Lol yes.
02-05-2018T04:03:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Where did that come from
02-05-2018T04:03:25,unsteddyphoenix,we...told you
02-05-2018T04:03:26,Bgrmystr2,"I would have probably made it a bit deeper, slightly louder, and gave it a bit of an echo"
02-05-2018T04:03:31,SpazztasticKiwi,You sound like a damn grinding stone
02-05-2018T04:04:01,Bgrmystr2,"but that's not somethin you could have done on the mic so that's not really on you, dadro"
02-05-2018T04:04:11,Bgrmystr2,just feels like it could have been better :(
02-05-2018T04:04:31,Dadrobit,https://soundcloud.com/daddrobit/terroraptor-wut/s-7MgxQ This is also me.
02-05-2018T04:04:45,Dadrobit,"Eh, it was how he liked it."
02-05-2018T04:05:01,Bgrmystr2,well alright
02-05-2018T04:05:35,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, ain't my project I guess. I'm so used to watching the cutscenes from like.. Warcraft 2, Diablo 2, Diablo 3, etc"
02-05-2018T04:05:51,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s one confused velociraptor
02-05-2018T04:05:55,Bgrmystr2,there's always so much depth..
02-05-2018T04:06:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Not as bone rattling as Kratos though
02-05-2018T04:06:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Or Tom
02-05-2018T04:06:42,Dadrobit,"Yeah, unfortunately, I can only get so far with my voice into James Earl Jones territory."
02-05-2018T04:06:45,SpazztasticKiwi,That laugh though
02-05-2018T04:06:47,Bgrmystr2,Where's the volume control on Soundcloud?
02-05-2018T04:06:52,Bgrmystr2,it's so quiet
02-05-2018T04:07:40,Dadrobit,"The beginning is quite because the engineer was just yelling through the window and not using the ""talk back"" mic."
02-05-2018T04:07:44,Dadrobit,quiet
02-05-2018T04:07:55,Bgrmystr2,ahh
02-05-2018T04:08:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Sounds like you almost choked on your own spit there for a second
02-05-2018T04:08:27,Bgrmystr2,"and I wouldn't expect that guy, Dadro. But if you can do a good John Patrick Lowrie, I'd sex your voice right there.. if, you know, I was into that sorta thing lol"
02-05-2018T04:08:27,Dadrobit,You can hear him start to use it halfway through saying velociraptor.
02-05-2018T04:08:49,Bgrmystr2,I literally can't hear anything at ALL except the sound you did
02-05-2018T04:08:51,Dadrobit,I swallowed my uvula for a second.
02-05-2018T04:09:01,Bgrmystr2,and the laughter afterwards
02-05-2018T04:09:06,Bgrmystr2,that's the only thing even audible lol
02-05-2018T04:09:11,SpazztasticKiwi,*Cackling
02-05-2018T04:09:19,Bgrmystr2,"wouldn't consider it so, Kiwi"
02-05-2018T04:10:15,Dadrobit,"Oh, actually got to meet Lowrie at an expo last year, was very cool."
02-05-2018T04:10:27,Bgrmystr2,"Well, yeah okay I guess I could see how you'd hear that Kiwi"
02-05-2018T04:11:05,Bgrmystr2,"The dude's got the voice of a god. I mean, it's one thing that he did the Sniper's voice from TF2, but have you heard the voiceover from the opening to Total Annihilation"
02-05-2018T04:11:32,Bgrmystr2,that shit is Don Lafontaine level of badass
02-05-2018T04:11:57,Dadrobit,"But yeah, I don't often get to use mt ""damned grinding stone"" voice for work, so it was fun to do that for the guy."
02-05-2018T04:12:01,Dadrobit,my*
02-05-2018T04:13:51,Dadrobit,He's got a kind of low key trans-atlantic accent going on there.
02-05-2018T04:15:07,Bgrmystr2,"goin on where, exactly? :o"
02-05-2018T04:15:22,Dadrobit,Total Annihilation opening
02-05-2018T04:15:25,Bgrmystr2,ahh that
02-05-2018T04:15:27,Bgrmystr2,yeah
02-05-2018T04:15:44,Bgrmystr2,it's probably my favorite movie trailer voiceover
02-05-2018T04:16:12,Bgrmystr2,"There's a lot of good actual movie ones, but that one's not even.. and it's still my favorite"
02-05-2018T04:23:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m going on to bed guys
02-05-2018T04:24:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll see you tomorrow
02-05-2018T04:24:41,Dadrobit,"Night, Spazz."
02-05-2018T04:26:07,Dadrobit,"brb, gonna get some chow."
02-05-2018T04:30:36,Bgrmystr2,ahh late gnight Kiwi
02-05-2018T04:41:25,Dadrobit,Back with taquitos.
02-05-2018T04:52:01,Bgrmystr2,wb to you and your food
02-05-2018T08:27:01,DRAGONTANOPUG,:ptv-sleepy: mornin...
02-05-2018T08:30:28,DRAGONTANOPUG,Gtg to school bye!
02-05-2018T13:12:59,Twokinds,My nightmares make no sense.
02-05-2018T13:14:00,Vatruvius,No sense huh?
02-05-2018T13:14:29,Vatruvius,"Also, hello people! :ptv-greetings:"
02-05-2018T13:40:13,Vatruvius,Are you serious!? I am shopping at Walmart and I went to the very back to get paper towels and someone stole my cart! :ptv-angry:
02-05-2018T13:54:23,TheBeckoner,hah
02-05-2018T13:54:25,TheBeckoner,kinda funny
02-05-2018T14:08:32,Vatruvius,"That is not funny, it is very rude."
02-05-2018T14:08:58,Vatruvius,"Maybe funny if it does not happen to you, but still."
02-05-2018T14:17:40,PhilTheIdle,@Twokinds Dreams never make sense. That's the cool thing about it. But what did you dream?
02-05-2018T14:31:52,TheBeckoner,was it full of stuff?
02-05-2018T14:47:54,BadFoMo,Drink the soda again?
02-05-2018T14:48:07,BadFoMo,*Drank
02-05-2018T14:50:01,SpazztasticKiwi,😨 nightmare?
02-05-2018T14:51:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember a nightmare I had that wasn’t scary in that it had monsters - it was just that it had no way of being logical and everyone else but me was acting like it was
02-05-2018T14:56:14,Twokinds,I dreamt that I was playing God of War.
02-05-2018T14:56:38,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
02-05-2018T14:57:17,Twokinds,"And I panicked, because I don't own a PS4, and I was wondering why I spent that money on a game I'm not really interested in."
02-05-2018T14:57:38,SpazztasticKiwi,😑
02-05-2018T14:57:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Could’ve been a dream present
02-05-2018T14:57:58,Bgrmystr2,I don't... know if that's like.. nightmare-level lol
02-05-2018T14:58:07,Bgrmystr2,right? kiwi
02-05-2018T14:58:08,Twokinds,lol I know
02-05-2018T14:58:37,Twokinds,"But that's how all my ""nightmares"" are. Extremely mundane stuff like ""where did the money for this come from?!"""
02-05-2018T14:58:54,Bgrmystr2,Maybe if you were IN God of War and trying to survive someshit with everyone dying around you and all that stuff.. then okay
02-05-2018T14:59:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"Mine’s similar in that it’s not really a nightmare either, but also not that level"
02-05-2018T15:00:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d be a quest giving character in that game. They seem to be safe
02-05-2018T15:03:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, I’ve been thinking how Colin’s name is said"
02-05-2018T15:10:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Co-lin or Caw-lin - I’ve seen the spelling said both ways
02-05-2018T15:12:51,Bgrmystr2,"both of those are the same pronunciation, the latter"
02-05-2018T15:13:05,Bgrmystr2,I don't see how the first would be different
02-05-2018T15:18:09,Vatruvius,"Well this is exciting, I just got you Art Evolution book in the mail Tom."
02-05-2018T15:18:22,Vatruvius,Look forward to going through it.
02-05-2018T15:18:34,Vatruvius,Looking*
02-05-2018T15:19:27,SpazztasticKiwi,They’re not the same
02-05-2018T15:19:58,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s easier to hear the difference but that’s for in person
02-05-2018T15:20:33,Vatruvius,One is like semicolon and the other is the typical way I have hear Colin pronounced.
02-05-2018T15:24:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Exactly
02-05-2018T15:24:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Some people spell the latter Collin
02-05-2018T15:25:19,Bgrmystr2,that's really not how pronunciations work but okay xD
02-05-2018T15:26:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I wen to school with a guy named Colin that was pronounced “Co-lin”.
02-05-2018T15:26:20,SpazztasticKiwi,My DAD was “Caw-lin”
02-05-2018T15:27:52,SpazztasticKiwi,The fact that those are swapped points at how they were often mixed up
02-05-2018T15:28:17,Bgrmystr2,"I don't see anything swapped, those are the same pronunciation to me."
02-05-2018T15:28:31,Bgrmystr2,but I guess reading and hearing are different
02-05-2018T15:28:33,Vatruvius,Names do not really follow pronunciation rules Bgr.
02-05-2018T15:28:57,Bgrmystr2,"for the most part, generally they do"
02-05-2018T15:29:15,SpazztasticKiwi,My dad was said like semicolon while my classmate was the other
02-05-2018T15:29:59,Bgrmystr2,"it's just that people who don't follow those rules out of lack of knowledge or that they don't care, that's when names don't follow pronunciation rules."
02-05-2018T15:30:22,SpazztasticKiwi,You just can’t see anything differently can you
02-05-2018T15:30:42,Bgrmystr2,"I can see lots of things differently, I'm just not being shown any differently lol"
02-05-2018T15:31:53,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, the only thing I'm trying to figure out is how a semicolon in pronunciation changes vowel sounds"
02-05-2018T15:31:59,Bgrmystr2,cuz that's not how it's used
02-05-2018T15:33:30,Vatruvius,"Prople want unique names, so the either pronouce them differently or spell the differently. The name Elissa, Elyssa, Alyssa, etc. is a great example."
02-05-2018T15:34:09,Bgrmystr2,"yeh, spelled differently"
02-05-2018T15:34:38,Vatruvius,And pronounced differently too.
02-05-2018T15:34:54,Bgrmystr2,all three are pronounced exactly the same way
02-05-2018T15:35:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Both pronouncions: https://inogolo.com/pronunciation/Colin
02-05-2018T15:35:30,Bgrmystr2,why the fuck would anyone use the first
02-05-2018T15:36:08,SpazztasticKiwi,My dad’s parents thought it was nice
02-05-2018T15:36:29,SpazztasticKiwi,He was named after an old famous actor
02-05-2018T15:36:42,Bgrmystr2,yes cuz having your name pronounced colon is great..
02-05-2018T15:37:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Do you realize how insulting you’re being or do you just not car
02-05-2018T15:37:54,Vatruvius,They are all pronounced similarly. There are multiple pronunciations for Elissa but tgey can all be applied to the different spellings.
02-05-2018T15:38:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Because yes there’s weird spelling but that’s a characteristic of the English language
02-05-2018T15:39:00,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: I'm not the one who made the decision to use a word for a name that would get their kid looked at funny. You'd think I don't know what that's like, people making fun of you for your name?"
02-05-2018T15:39:25,SpazztasticKiwi,That isn’t my point
02-05-2018T15:39:45,Bgrmystr2,"so no, I find it more insulting someone would do that on purpose either knowing, or not bothering to care what kind of things would happen."
02-05-2018T15:40:22,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s only an insult if you bring it up instead of just using the name as it is
02-05-2018T15:41:03,Bgrmystr2,It's always there.
02-05-2018T15:41:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Bullying comes form purposely pointing out double meanings
02-05-2018T15:41:23,SpazztasticKiwi,*from
02-05-2018T15:42:09,Bgrmystr2,So preventing it from happening isn't possible then?
02-05-2018T15:42:11,Bgrmystr2,:/
02-05-2018T15:42:30,Bgrmystr2,or at least doing a part to attempt
02-05-2018T15:42:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"Again, not the point"
02-05-2018T15:43:08,Bgrmystr2,Guess I missed it then
02-05-2018T15:43:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Actively trying to prevent bullying by tiptoes around possible triggers isn’t the goal
02-05-2018T15:44:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Teaching yourself not to nitpick and others not to bully is the goal
02-05-2018T15:44:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Spelling and pronunciation is stupid
02-05-2018T15:44:38,Bgrmystr2,"that's not really tiptoeing though, but okay, then, please enlighten me to the point of what you're tryin to say xD"
02-05-2018T15:46:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you’re saying people should change a kids name’s spelling because of the possibility that someone could take the spelling in a way that pronounces as an insulting word or concept, that’s tiptoeing"
02-05-2018T15:47:14,Bgrmystr2,"No, not change. That it shouldn't have been that way in the first place. Part of the responsibility of naming a kid is not naming them something stupid. Like ""Baby"" or ""Conception"" or whatnot."
02-05-2018T15:47:32,Bgrmystr2,things that are /going/ to be a problem
02-05-2018T15:48:05,SpazztasticKiwi,A name that seems stupid to you has a meaning to the person with the name
02-05-2018T15:48:33,Vatruvius,Not to mention the meaning it has to the parents who gave it.
02-05-2018T15:49:01,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s family names and traditional names. Native American names are wacky as hell and those have depth in the culture
02-05-2018T15:49:09,Bgrmystr2,"The parents not actually caring about the name enough to just name their baby ""Baby"" ? This is meaning to you?"
02-05-2018T15:49:47,SpazztasticKiwi,The fact that it’s silly to me or that I wouldn’t use it is irrelevant
02-05-2018T15:50:07,Vatruvius,So you have met every single parent that has named their child Baby and have deemed that in every case they simply did not care. What kind of parent does not care about what they name their child?
02-05-2018T15:50:35,Bgrmystr2,"The people who live here, and send their kids to school where my mother has to be the parent those kids never had"
02-05-2018T15:50:47,Vatruvius,What you are talking about Bgr is a minority of parents.
02-05-2018T15:50:48,Bgrmystr2,they are the kind of parent that do not care.
02-05-2018T15:51:01,Bgrmystr2,and there's a whoooooooole lot of em
02-05-2018T15:51:45,Vatruvius,that*
02-05-2018T15:51:55,SpazztasticKiwi,But is it any of your business to judge another’s decision that doesn’t effect you?
02-05-2018T15:52:10,Bgrmystr2,"hundreds of kids, multiple schools, many many different stories, but a common theme that reoccurs throughout"
02-05-2018T15:52:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah it’s stupid but there’s better things to worry yourself with
02-05-2018T15:52:35,SpazztasticKiwi,And they can change their name legally one day if they please
02-05-2018T15:53:06,Bgrmystr2,I don't think it should have ever come to that in the first place
02-05-2018T15:54:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Funny thing about free will and a free country: stupid can happen legally
02-05-2018T15:54:04,Bgrmystr2,"You can't expect everyone else to just bend to some type of ""standard"" that you make up, though it's nice to attempt. It just won't happen. People are assholes. You have to do what you can with your own decisions."
02-05-2018T15:54:32,SpazztasticKiwi,What does that have to do with this subject
02-05-2018T15:54:36,Bgrmystr2,"And with my decisions, in this case, I'd start with not naming my kid somethin that would bother them for the rest of their life."
02-05-2018T15:54:52,Bgrmystr2,cuz that's part of the responsibility of being a parent
02-05-2018T15:54:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok that’s your business then
02-05-2018T15:55:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Everyone else’s naming and their spelling and pronunciation logic is theirs
02-05-2018T15:55:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a name that’s overused as hell for girls
02-05-2018T15:55:58,Vatruvius,"Even if you think the spelling or pronunciation is stupid and should not have happened, you still have to respect it."
02-05-2018T15:56:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Hence why i don’t mind being called Kiwi
02-05-2018T15:56:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Not have to respect it no
02-05-2018T15:56:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Not to me
02-05-2018T15:56:53,Bgrmystr2,"Spelling and pronunciation are common across the board, widely understood. It's not like people can make rules up as they go, cuz that would make pronunciation and spelling pointless."
02-05-2018T15:56:59,SpazztasticKiwi,My name insinuates a certain personality in a way
02-05-2018T15:57:04,Vatruvius,"Well, you can't be rude about how a person's name is spelled or pronounced."
02-05-2018T15:57:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh people make their own rules everywhere
02-05-2018T15:57:39,Bgrmystr2,"yeah they do, kiwi, and it doesn't mean it works."
02-05-2018T15:57:43,SpazztasticKiwi,The fact that they make no sense or shouldn’t isn’t gonna change their mind unfortunately
02-05-2018T15:57:53,Bgrmystr2,it's going to make their life hell though
02-05-2018T15:58:24,SpazztasticKiwi,It can
02-05-2018T15:58:45,SpazztasticKiwi,We had 3 Katelyns in our class group
02-05-2018T15:59:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember at least two wasn’t spelled the same
02-05-2018T15:59:07,Vatruvius,That just makes it confusing. Which Katelyn are we talking about.
02-05-2018T15:59:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Drove me batty
02-05-2018T15:59:36,SpazztasticKiwi,But that’s the parents making a “unique name”
02-05-2018T16:00:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Is it stupid? Very. But I can’t change it nor can I by griping or worrying about it
02-05-2018T16:00:27,Vatruvius,"I do not mind what a person is named, it is their name, their identity. If they chose to change it that is up to them. I do not care how it is spelled, pronounced, or anything else. A person's name is a part of who they are and it should be respected."
02-05-2018T16:00:41,Vatruvius,"Even if you would never name your child that, it is still that person's name."
02-05-2018T16:01:21,SpazztasticKiwi,People misspell my name because of the multiple spellings it has. Comes with having an overused name
02-05-2018T16:02:17,Bgrmystr2,"And I agree Vatru. I do, however, think that parents should have the common decency to not pick something obviously problematic. If there's hidden meaning or whatever, fine, I guess, but a lot of people use that excuse to be lazy"
02-05-2018T16:02:20,Bgrmystr2,and that's not excusable
02-05-2018T16:02:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Some people think they’re being clever though too with their names
02-05-2018T16:03:21,Bgrmystr2,and it's not okay to say it's their choice because they're making a decision that affects someone else. It has to be made with that person's well-being in mind.
02-05-2018T16:03:45,Bgrmystr2,"If it's not made with that person's well-being in mind, it's simply a selfish decision."
02-05-2018T16:03:54,Vatruvius,"I have no idea if this is true but I would not be surprised. I heard from a friend in middle school, so many years ago, that a parent named their child Hairy. The family name was Dick."
02-05-2018T16:03:56,Bgrmystr2,It happens sometimes
02-05-2018T16:04:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Like the couple that spelled their daughter’s name as “Ka8lyn” or something like that. It had a number is what I remember
02-05-2018T16:04:24,Vatruvius,Really?
02-05-2018T16:04:57,Bgrmystr2,"as much as those I could understand being jokes, happening in real life would just be sad."
02-05-2018T16:05:12,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s being unique and then there’s being ridiculous
02-05-2018T16:05:15,Bgrmystr2,"some names are not so bad, but others are just obvious"
02-05-2018T16:05:30,Vatruvius,I guess it could happen if a parent despised the child.
02-05-2018T16:23:49,Vatruvius,Well I am going to head out. Catch you guys later today most likely.
02-05-2018T16:24:00,SpazztasticKiwi,👍🏻
02-05-2018T16:32:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Anyone got good plans for Mother’s Day? I’m debating doing something other than going out for dinner this year
02-05-2018T16:37:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Why’s Picarto telling me Vat doesn’t exist anymore?
02-05-2018T16:38:40,Bgrmystr2,"Vatru left the room, so.."
02-05-2018T16:38:51,Bgrmystr2,"""Not online anymore"""
02-05-2018T16:39:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Weird
02-05-2018T16:39:26,Bgrmystr2,doesn't seem weird to me. Why would it not say they're offline if they're offline?
02-05-2018T16:39:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Probably helps prevent 100 messages being in your inbox when you return
02-05-2018T16:39:53,Bgrmystr2,there is no inbox on picarto though xD
02-05-2018T16:40:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Whispers
02-05-2018T16:40:09,Bgrmystr2,they're only there when you're online though
02-05-2018T16:40:16,Bgrmystr2,just like this chat here
02-05-2018T16:41:43,Bgrmystr2,"the whispers work the same way as the normal chat. you log off and noone can talk to you cuz you're not here. when you log on, you can see some of the chat history, but whispers don't save"
02-05-2018T16:41:53,Bgrmystr2,cuz offline
02-05-2018T16:42:21,Bgrmystr2,it's very normal
02-05-2018T16:43:23,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Boi, i aced my math test!"
02-05-2018T16:43:47,SpazztasticKiwi,If I need an in-depth explanation I’ll ask
02-05-2018T16:44:27,DRAGONTANOPUG,Ok
02-05-2018T16:44:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Not you
02-05-2018T16:45:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Good job on math. “A” aced it?
02-05-2018T16:46:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Do keep on top of it though. It gets harder as you go
02-05-2018T16:48:03,SiliconCarbide,a nora card is up for grabs!
02-05-2018T16:49:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Yep. I’d have no idea what to pick though so someone else can get it
02-05-2018T16:50:07,Bgrmystr2,"It's ok kiwi, I'll give one even if ya dont' ask :)"
02-05-2018T16:50:42,Bgrmystr2,"wish I could nab a Nora card, but don't have the monies for that"
02-05-2018T16:51:42,SiliconCarbide,i could but i really shouldnt
02-05-2018T16:52:00,SiliconCarbide,id just get all zen kat pcitures colored because i find marvs commentary entertaining
02-05-2018T16:52:18,Bgrmystr2,"same, know that feel"
02-05-2018T16:53:31,SpazztasticKiwi,We’re all a little obsessed with Kat
02-05-2018T16:53:45,Bgrmystr2,are we? :o
02-05-2018T16:53:51,SiliconCarbide,we are
02-05-2018T16:53:54,SiliconCarbide,rightlya so
02-05-2018T16:54:48,Bgrmystr2,"I wouldn't say so myself, but I do like Kat similar to how I like other characters"
02-05-2018T16:55:15,Bgrmystr2,"also, had to reload the page in a new tab, previous one is infinite reconnection loop"
02-05-2018T16:55:47,Bgrmystr2,Dunno if I have a favorite character yet
02-05-2018T16:56:06,SiliconCarbide,well i know mines definetely not red
02-05-2018T16:56:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I kinda have a tie between Kat and Flora
02-05-2018T16:58:12,Bgrmystr2,"Kat's nice and all, but honestly, I'm torn between Flora and Natani. I like Natani's tendancy for her tsun and her boyish attitude, and I like Flora's cute exterior but her more adult-oriented personality"
02-05-2018T16:58:31,Bgrmystr2,"that's just me though, Kat's just as nice of a character as they are"
02-05-2018T16:59:11,SiliconCarbide,id say shes the most relatable of all
02-05-2018T16:59:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Kat’s got such an artistic side to her. Crafty and resourceful
02-05-2018T17:00:11,SpazztasticKiwi,With just a hint of sarcasm
02-05-2018T17:00:23,Bgrmystr2,"I don't know if I relate to any of em, myself :thinking: . I can relate to choices some of em make, but it's not an overarching thing"
02-05-2018T17:01:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I can relate to Nat’s not wanting kids
02-05-2018T17:02:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Though that may be more due to the guy side
02-05-2018T17:02:33,Bgrmystr2,I would think that's almost 100% entirely due to the guy side XD
02-05-2018T17:03:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Aw come on. You’re telling me there’s no guys that want to experience the joys of pregnancy? 😆
02-05-2018T17:03:35,Bgrmystr2,uh.. xD
02-05-2018T17:03:52,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. I'm sure that's not a serious question
02-05-2018T17:04:10,SiliconCarbide,generalizing like that you could never be sure
02-05-2018T17:04:23,Bgrmystr2,I'm sure SOME wouldn't mind... but for the most part
02-05-2018T17:05:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I know. I just kid
02-05-2018T17:06:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I have friends who’ll never be able to carry the children they want because they physically can’t and neither can their partner
02-05-2018T17:28:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Stupid squirrel just ran out in front of me
02-05-2018T17:30:30,DRAGONTANOPUG,You driving while texting?
02-05-2018T17:38:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m at McDonald’s now
02-05-2018T17:38:40,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s been 10 minutes
02-05-2018T17:41:16,Vatruvius,Very cool book Tom...learned some things I did not know. I assume with it being Vol. 1 there will be another Art and Evolution book some time in the future.
02-05-2018T17:42:30,Vatruvius,"Natani never mentioned kids Kiwi, definitely because of the guy thing but so far he has not mentioned a thing about sex either. It is a grey area for him. Especially now with youngNatani coming in."
02-05-2018T17:44:36,SpazztasticKiwi,The best moment with her has to be the “do you wanna touch em?”
02-05-2018T17:46:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Did offer to swap the ability to reproduce with Kat when she revealed she was sterile though. Which was sweet
02-05-2018T17:47:47,DRAGONTANOPUG,It ticks me off that in the tk wiki they say natanis gender is female and mind is male! She is a god damn tomboy which means she still is not a male in the mind!
02-05-2018T17:48:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh she’s male in mind
02-05-2018T17:48:12,DRAGONTANOPUG,Stop
02-05-2018T17:48:26,Bgrmystr2,She is though.
02-05-2018T17:48:29,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s literally stated in the comic
02-05-2018T17:48:30,Bgrmystr2,LIterally in the story
02-05-2018T17:48:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Jinx Bgr 😀
02-05-2018T17:48:59,Bgrmystr2,s'ok :v
02-05-2018T17:49:06,Bgrmystr2,I won't be getting you a soda or anything
02-05-2018T17:49:09,Vatruvius,"Totally forgot about that Kiwi. But that was before youngNatani. Who knows how that will effect Natani now. After sleeping with Keith he did say he was not ""ready"" for that after discovering what was poking him."
02-05-2018T17:49:14,Bgrmystr2,oh hey you're back
02-05-2018T17:49:24,Bgrmystr2,"oh wait, you were back before nvm"
02-05-2018T17:49:32,Bgrmystr2,I didn't notice sorry :C
02-05-2018T17:49:37,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Yea its is but, somwhere in chapter 18 or 19 she is reunited with her younger self"
02-05-2018T17:49:40,Vatruvius,No problem.
02-05-2018T17:49:45,Bgrmystr2,These ORANGE NAME PEOPLE &gt;:T
02-05-2018T17:49:50,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-pouty:
02-05-2018T17:50:08,DRAGONTANOPUG,Better?
02-05-2018T17:50:14,Vatruvius,"She is not reunited, rather rediscovered. Both parts are still seperate."
02-05-2018T17:50:37,Bgrmystr2,"yay, so now you'll blend in with those the likes of Beck and such"
02-05-2018T17:50:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"I know who you’re talking about, but I’ve been debating what color Vat’s name is: is it really orangey or more salmon colored?"
02-05-2018T17:50:41,Bgrmystr2,who have red names
02-05-2018T17:50:45,DRAGONTANOPUG,Ugh even tom said she was a tomboy.
02-05-2018T17:51:08,Bgrmystr2,she can be a tomboy and be partially male mentally at the same time
02-05-2018T17:51:18,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, that is how the story was written, and it's understood as such"
02-05-2018T17:51:24,Bgrmystr2,it's not really a problem
02-05-2018T17:51:32,DRAGONTANOPUG,:ptv-kippi2: does it matter
02-05-2018T17:51:47,Bgrmystr2,"to us, no, but to you apparently it does very much so"
02-05-2018T17:51:48,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s easy to be female but have what can be called/considered “male” thoughts
02-05-2018T17:51:58,Vatruvius,So fsr Natani is showing more feminine characteristics but still is male in mind mostly. We have to wait and see how the fusion of these two parts of Natani's personality will effect his gender view and such.
02-05-2018T17:52:36,Bgrmystr2,yeh I'm actually expecting tom to make youngtani a character ppl are gonna really like.. then she's gonna fuse with current natani sometime down the line
02-05-2018T17:52:43,Bgrmystr2,and ppl are gonna sadface
02-05-2018T17:52:54,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, it's just a theory, but that's what I think will happen"
02-05-2018T17:53:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Ppl gonna be mad no matter what he does sadly
02-05-2018T17:53:23,Bgrmystr2,"well yeah, but she's not going to be a character for just a few pages or whatever"
02-05-2018T17:53:24,DRAGONTANOPUG,Im not i rather her be a her
02-05-2018T17:53:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I just want to see what happens
02-05-2018T17:53:31,Vatruvius,Tom has stated that youngNatani is a tomboy. That we know and that much is obvious. Probably the only thing allowing Natani's two parts to even communicate really.
02-05-2018T17:54:14,Bgrmystr2,"I think youngtani is gonna be there for a while, enough time to solidify herself as her own kind of female personality, a look into how natani would be as 100% female mental state"
02-05-2018T17:54:43,Vatruvius,"Thought youngNatani is there, oldNatani is in complete control of his body. YoungNatani foes not."
02-05-2018T17:54:58,Bgrmystr2,"it's all mental though, so yknow"
02-05-2018T17:54:59,Vatruvius,Though*
02-05-2018T17:55:12,Vatruvius,does*
02-05-2018T17:55:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I can kind of empathize with Nat. You can have moments when you feel more one thing than the other
02-05-2018T17:56:43,Vatruvius,"I hope they do fuse at some point and Natani bes at least accepting of his female body, or maybe even embrace it. But Natani being masculine and a tomboy esc. is what makes him a likable character to me."
02-05-2018T17:58:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"Guy or girl, Nat’s good looking"
02-05-2018T17:58:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Six pack and boobs? No fair 😆
02-05-2018T18:01:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Zein’s been growing on me too lately
02-05-2018T18:01:11,SpazztasticKiwi,*Zen’s
02-05-2018T18:02:26,Vatruvius,"It is no fair. Super sexy and can play with himself, with the mind of a guy and all. And he just hides them when he does not want them out."
02-05-2018T18:10:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom, your characters are too attractive"
02-05-2018T18:10:33,Vatruvius,"Ueah Tom, knock it off!"
02-05-2018T18:10:38,Vatruvius,Yeah*
02-05-2018T18:10:51,Vatruvius,:ptv-snicker:
02-05-2018T18:14:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Or at least point me to who they’re based off of in real life
02-05-2018T18:15:09,DRAGONTANOPUG,I keep crashing minecraft for changing my skin:ptv-unimpressed:
02-05-2018T18:17:14,Vatruvius,That is a you problem.
02-05-2018T18:19:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Or ya know do the obvious solution and stop changing skins
02-05-2018T18:21:20,Vatruvius,Or you can just use an online skin making service and not have to do it manually.
02-05-2018T18:22:22,Bgrmystr2,"there's templates for changing skins, and you should be doing the skin-change through the website"
02-05-2018T18:22:31,Vatruvius,"Okay, back to how sexy Tom's characters are."
02-05-2018T18:22:38,Bgrmystr2,"so if done properly, it won't crash, no matter how many times you change skins"
02-05-2018T18:24:04,Bgrmystr2,"Also, can always check the skindex"
02-05-2018T18:24:27,Bgrmystr2,"if it still exists, that is :thinking:"
02-05-2018T18:28:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Daniels is pretty good looking
02-05-2018T18:28:33,SpazztasticKiwi,But of course he’s taken
02-05-2018T18:31:33,Vatruvius,lol
02-05-2018T18:31:51,SpazztasticKiwi,All the hot ones are taken
02-05-2018T18:32:26,Vatruvius,Poor Sythe and Red. Not sexy enough for Kiwi.
02-05-2018T18:32:46,CrimsonFall,that pizza guy doesnt look bad either
02-05-2018T18:32:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Red is nice and all but I’d be more likely to be his friend
02-05-2018T18:33:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Yea pizza guy has his own charm too but is he a character or more of a concept for side story
02-05-2018T18:34:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Though he does bring pizza along with his good looks so
02-05-2018T18:34:41,SpazztasticKiwi,And Sythe’s kinda in the same boat as Red
02-05-2018T18:34:42,Vatruvius,Are you hitting on Tom Kiwi! :ptv-ohmy:
02-05-2018T18:35:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"Due to how awkward that could make this conversation, I believe I’ll plead the 5th"
02-05-2018T18:37:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"Isn’t Red taken, at least in theory?"
02-05-2018T18:39:08,Vatruvius,"Technically, Red and Raine have this thing kinda going on. But that should come to light as more pages of chapter 20 are drawn."
02-05-2018T18:40:37,Vatruvius,I think Taine is absolutely awesome. She is really cute and innocent. Red has some serious character development coming along/change happening if he his to date Raine.
02-05-2018T18:45:30,Vatruvius,Taine*
02-05-2018T18:45:42,Vatruvius,Raine!*
02-05-2018T18:46:00,Vatruvius,STOP IT PHONE!
02-05-2018T18:46:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Phone: “no. I demand you suffer”
02-05-2018T18:47:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"I feel Red would be too frustrating to deal with. At least his prejudices. Since he seems to be getting over those tho, who knows"
02-05-2018T18:48:40,SpazztasticKiwi,But he still seems to be on the track to board the USS Relationship
02-05-2018T18:49:01,Vatruvius,Yup.
02-05-2018T18:49:18,Bgrmystr2,"I, too, like Taine. Though I believe she may have more of a chance with blue, as he had his character development last time. :ptv-snicker:"
02-05-2018T18:50:09,Vatruvius,Har har.
02-05-2018T18:50:20,Bgrmystr2,:v
02-05-2018T18:52:12,SpazztasticKiwi,:ptv-condescending: I see what you did there
02-05-2018T18:54:02,SpazztasticKiwi,The kitten is playing around on the bed and he rolled over and touched Bagheera
02-05-2018T18:54:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera just looked at me like “Mom! He’s touching me!”
02-05-2018T18:56:03,Vatruvius,lol
02-05-2018T18:57:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"If I do keep him, it’s going to be like having two elementary school sons at one time"
02-05-2018T19:01:17,Vatruvius,Have fun! :ptv-dealwithit:
02-05-2018T19:01:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I must resist the urge to say “be nice to your brother”
02-05-2018T19:02:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause Bagheera is salty
02-05-2018T19:03:21,SpazztasticKiwi,And I really don’t need another one
02-05-2018T19:05:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"But back on the characters, Sythe has an appeal in his naivety"
02-05-2018T19:05:55,Vatruvius,"Sure, he clearly has no romantic interests as of yet which I am fone with. Same with maren and Karen."
02-05-2018T19:06:07,Vatruvius,fine* Maren*
02-05-2018T19:06:15,SpazztasticKiwi,But he might not necessarily be my age
02-05-2018T19:08:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I suspect Maren is kind of a girl who’d be just as happy single and independent for the rest of her life
02-05-2018T19:09:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Karen’s gonna need someone young and attentive to keep up with her
02-05-2018T19:10:18,Vatruvius,But she is only 16 so...
02-05-2018T19:11:00,SpazztasticKiwi,That too. Dating is more of a thing for her rather than meeting someone
02-05-2018T19:11:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I suspect she has no interest in dating rn like a “normal” teen would
02-05-2018T19:11:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Granted she’s not normal in any sense anyway
02-05-2018T19:13:56,Vatruvius,She is super cute though.
02-05-2018T19:14:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Karen is such a delight. I’d definitely get along with her
02-05-2018T19:16:27,Vatruvius,I cannot believe it. Just got my computer back after repairs and the same exact keys are broken again!
02-05-2018T19:16:38,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s ghosts
02-05-2018T19:16:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Computer’s possessed
02-05-2018T19:18:12,Vatruvius,It is not that. The repair list details they replaced the key membranes but that only temporarily solved the issue. Since it is back they will have to replace the entire board. This is so dumb.
02-05-2018T19:19:47,SpazztasticKiwi,When did Tom log off
02-05-2018T19:20:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause he was here at the beginning of the conversation
02-05-2018T19:22:06,Vatruvius,He was here for awhile.
02-05-2018T19:23:23,Vatruvius,All I want to do is use my computer and play games!
02-05-2018T19:26:08,Bgrmystr2,"if you sent it for repair, they should have then replaced the board if they knew that was the problem."
02-05-2018T19:26:21,Bgrmystr2,"that's part of 'repairing' the keyboard, thus making it work again"
02-05-2018T19:28:46,Vatruvius,They replaced the problem keys' membrane.
02-05-2018T19:29:24,Vatruvius,At first it worked. But it is following the same path it did last time into complete unresponsiveness.
02-05-2018T19:29:57,Bgrmystr2,"if they knew that, they should have replaced the board too :/"
02-05-2018T19:30:03,Bgrmystr2,tis part of being a tech
02-05-2018T19:30:30,Bgrmystr2,do you have to give them the laptop back later for them to replace the board? or do you have to pay for that too?
02-05-2018T19:31:17,Vatruvius,I guess they thought replacing the membrane was enough. If the tested it then I see why they gave it the okay. It would have needed extensive testing to see if it fixed the problem.
02-05-2018T19:31:56,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
02-05-2018T19:32:21,Vatruvius,"All covered under warranty, but I do have to ship it to them to get it repaired. But shipping costs are covered too. Just means I won't have my computer again for a week."
02-05-2018T19:32:39,Bgrmystr2,"Ah, well then yeah"
02-05-2018T19:32:52,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, a lot of good it's doing right now with those keys broken lol"
02-05-2018T19:33:09,Vatruvius,Going to contact them now actually. Be back in a bit.
02-05-2018T19:37:08,SpazztasticKiwi,And where’d Crimson go? All they did was pop in with that pizza guy comment
02-05-2018T19:40:28,Vatruvius,Are they not online?
02-05-2018T19:41:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Not anymore apparently
02-05-2018T19:41:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Just a “I’ll just leave this gem here” and left
02-05-2018T19:42:50,Vatruvius,Huh? :thinking:
02-05-2018T19:44:03,SpazztasticKiwi,They’re the one that said the pizza guy wasn’t too bad looking
02-05-2018T19:45:01,SpazztasticKiwi,And I agreed he has his own charm and that the fact he brings pizza add to it
02-05-2018T19:45:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Might be why Tom peaced out
02-05-2018T19:46:06,Vatruvius,"Okay, new service request put in. This time they said they will request to have the entire keyboard replaced not the membranes."
02-05-2018T19:46:14,Vatruvius,lol
02-05-2018T19:46:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Or he has stuff to do
02-05-2018T19:46:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe second time’s the charm
02-05-2018T19:48:18,Vatruvius,Probably had stuff to do.
02-05-2018T19:49:30,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s that lawn. Grows like mad
02-05-2018T19:49:47,Vatruvius,Not that fast.
02-05-2018T19:50:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I know. Only thing I can think of right now
02-05-2018T19:51:09,Vatruvius,He could be working on the page he will draw tomorrow.
02-05-2018T19:51:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Or it’s grocery day
02-05-2018T19:52:17,SpazztasticKiwi,But yeah. Likely debating the page layout
02-05-2018T19:58:21,Bgrmystr2,"wait, who left what here?"
02-05-2018T19:58:30,Bgrmystr2,I didn't see anyone link anything here
02-05-2018T19:59:01,Vatruvius,"Not a link, just a comment"
02-05-2018T19:59:47,Bgrmystr2,oh what did they say? Cuz I haven't seen anything but like.. us commenting basically all day
02-05-2018T20:01:05,Vatruvius,"When we were talking about Tom's sexy characters, there was a comment about Tom, the pizza guy."
02-05-2018T20:02:46,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: Well, yknow.."
02-05-2018T20:07:18,Vatruvius,"When my man dog wants food and barks at me, I pick him up and put him in my lap. Begging solved."
02-05-2018T20:19:22,DRAGONTANOPUG,Or he just wants love...
02-05-2018T20:21:34,Vatruvius,He is not a love dog. He is standoff-ish
02-05-2018T20:25:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Cat in dog body
02-05-2018T20:26:57,Vatruvius,"Except that he hates all cats. He goes crazy, probably because that is one of the things my dad encouraged him to do."
02-05-2018T21:09:39,Vatruvius,I am learning HTML now.
02-05-2018T21:16:56,DRAGONTANOPUG,I dont wnat to leave for another week. I miss so much when i do.:ptv-sad: but i cant change that...
02-05-2018T21:19:06,DRAGONTANOPUG,Still gitbthe same amount of streams as usual...
02-05-2018T21:19:14,DRAGONTANOPUG,Got the *
02-05-2018T21:28:25,Vatruvius,Tell me about it. This keyboard issue is a pain. Not having my computer for two weeks in a row technically is just annoying.
02-05-2018T22:20:56,NightMeaty22,Hello
02-05-2018T22:28:28,totallynotTrace,hi guys
02-05-2018T22:28:32,totallynotTrace,hi night

02-05-2018T22:34:01,totallynotTrace,laundry
02-05-2018T22:34:26,totallynotTrace,exciting right?
02-05-2018T22:34:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Invigorating
02-05-2018T22:34:58,totallynotTrace,brb I the dryer just finished
02-05-2018T22:35:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t fall in
02-05-2018T22:37:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Think I’m gonna sit down and watch Freddy vs Jason
02-05-2018T22:38:06,NightMeaty22,Ok
02-05-2018T22:39:50,totallynotTrace,i is back
02-05-2018T22:40:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll still be hanging around
02-05-2018T22:40:11,totallynotTrace,thats a classic
02-05-2018T22:40:23,Vatruvius,"If you guys want to check out my awesome work in HTML, in other words a very primitive first time use of coding in it, then click this link and click the green ""run"" button in the top left."

02-05-2018T22:40:36,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s basically a big game of tag you’re it
02-05-2018T22:40:49,SpazztasticKiwi,With blood
02-05-2018T22:42:06,totallynotTrace,I havnt seenn it it years
02-05-2018T22:42:21,totallynotTrace,honestly dont remember much of it
02-05-2018T22:42:54,Vatruvius,"Okay, that is that assignment done."
02-05-2018T22:43:04,Vatruvius,"Ohh, Tom is back!"
02-05-2018T22:43:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I vouch for Jason more than Freddy since Freddy was a pedo and Jason was a tragic story
02-05-2018T22:44:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I have the platinum double disc copy. Special collection cover
02-05-2018T22:44:25,SpazztasticKiwi,One of the three special covers anyway
02-05-2018T22:45:01,totallynotTrace,oh and now we all know what Vat goes to school
02-05-2018T22:45:58,totallynotTrace,also a fellow community college member
02-05-2018T22:46:43,totallynotTrace,good job on your html
02-05-2018T22:46:57,Vatruvius,Thanks.
02-05-2018T22:47:31,Vatruvius,"I like Jason more as well, probably because I own the Friday the 13th game which is just super fun and awesome so..."
02-05-2018T22:47:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Not bad at all 🤔
02-05-2018T22:47:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Reminds me of when I took web design
02-05-2018T22:48:22,Vatruvius,"I am not a psychopath, I just like brutally murdering all the counselors in unique ways. Totally normal."
02-05-2018T22:48:45,totallynotTrace,100%
02-05-2018T22:49:02,Vatruvius,"Yeah, that was raw coding in HTML. I know there are a lot of popular web design applications that make it easier and do not require to know or even tough HTML code."
02-05-2018T22:49:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"The psychopath was his mother. After he died and took his revenge, it should have been done"
02-05-2018T22:50:11,SpazztasticKiwi,But she kept him going. Cause he always obeys his mother
02-05-2018T22:51:02,Vatruvius,"If you ever want to play an awesome multiplayer game about horror and Jason in particular, get Friday the 13th: The Game."
02-05-2018T22:51:16,Vatruvius,It is on steam and super cool.
02-05-2018T22:51:43,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s adorable. I’ve seen it
02-05-2018T22:52:13,Vatruvius,Adorable is a very...interesting choice of words to describe that game.
02-05-2018T22:52:38,totallynotTrace,I dont think they were aiming for adorable when making a horror game
02-05-2018T22:53:32,totallynotTrace,a youtuber im subbed to played it for a while
02-05-2018T22:53:47,totallynotTrace,horror isnt really my style
02-05-2018T22:54:16,totallynotTrace,but i still found it interesting
02-05-2018T22:54:40,Vatruvius,Once you play it a couple times it really is not horror as much as it is just a survival/escape game.
02-05-2018T22:55:12,totallynotTrace,My laptop probably cant run it at a playable framerate
02-05-2018T22:55:54,Vatruvius,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw7wr4oPQy4
02-05-2018T22:56:00,Vatruvius,This video sums it up.
02-05-2018T22:56:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"As a horror villain, I like Freddy, but Jason’s one of my top favorites"
02-05-2018T22:56:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Of course there’s also the Jeepers Creepers monster
02-05-2018T22:56:57,SpazztasticKiwi,And Mike Myers
02-05-2018T22:58:18,totallynotTrace,"""The least happy camper in film history"" lol"
02-05-2018T23:00:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to see Mike go up against Freddy and Jason
02-05-2018T23:01:38,Vatruvius,"""Scouring around...blah blah blah...until whoever was lucky enough to get the fun character shoes up to beat your ass."""
02-05-2018T23:01:50,totallynotTrace,wait wait wait wait
02-05-2018T23:01:51,Vatruvius,shows*
02-05-2018T23:02:07,totallynotTrace,so therers an archery range at the camp
02-05-2018T23:02:14,totallynotTrace,can you shoot jason?
02-05-2018T23:02:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Jason can’t die
02-05-2018T23:02:23,Vatruvius,You can!
02-05-2018T23:02:41,SpazztasticKiwi,His only weakness is water. Freddy’s is fire
02-05-2018T23:02:45,Vatruvius,"With shotguns, to the face, does absolutely nothing but stuns him shortly!"
02-05-2018T23:03:08,totallynotTrace,oh
02-05-2018T23:03:16,Vatruvius,"In this game you actually swim around as Jason, er...rather walk around on the water bed when campers try to swim."
02-05-2018T23:03:47,SpazztasticKiwi,The only way I’ve seen them get rid of Jason is to tie him up and sink him back to the bottom of the lake
02-05-2018T23:03:51,Vatruvius,"There is a way to kill Jason, but it is not easy."
02-05-2018T23:04:07,Vatruvius,All in-game by the way.
02-05-2018T23:04:08,totallynotTrace,i feel like the steamer ive been watching has been holding out
02-05-2018T23:04:39,Vatruvius,Watch Ohmwrecker. He has like 80+ videos on it I think.
02-05-2018T23:04:51,DRAGONTANOPUG,Yay vanoss stuff!

02-05-2018T23:05:43,Vatruvius,Vanoss is one of the top youtubers in the world. He does not play Friday the 13th though.

02-05-2018T23:07:29,DRAGONTANOPUG,Idk u know who pewdiepie is?
02-05-2018T23:07:38,Vatruvius,"Because his stuff is really funny. But watch Ohmwrecker if you want to see more about Friday the 13th, he still uploads the occasional video now and then."
02-05-2018T23:08:18,totallynotTrace,yeah i unsubscribed from pewds a while ago. his videos just became stuff i didnt like
02-05-2018T23:08:33,DRAGONTANOPUG,2013 pewds?

02-05-2018T23:09:29,totallynotTrace,in 2011
02-05-2018T23:09:34,Vatruvius,I never really liked Pewdiepie. Just not my type of content. And 42k is nothing to what he has so...
02-05-2018T23:09:51,DRAGONTANOPUG,Do you know how much he has trace?
02-05-2018T23:10:02,SpazztasticKiwi,YouTube purge

02-05-2018T23:10:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Clears inactive and spam accounts
02-05-2018T23:10:23,DRAGONTANOPUG,61 million
02-05-2018T23:10:26,Vatruvius,"Ohh yeah, there is that too."
02-05-2018T23:10:33,totallynotTrace,isnt it 50s oh my

02-05-2018T23:11:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I forgot about the nude scenes in this movie
02-05-2018T23:12:04,totallynotTrace,"62,401428"
02-05-2018T23:12:08,Vatruvius,"In a Jason type film, nude everywhere."
02-05-2018T23:12:12,DRAGONTANOPUG,Do we need to know?
02-05-2018T23:12:26,Vatruvius,"We do, just not you TANO"
02-05-2018T23:12:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Jason likes the booty I guess
02-05-2018T23:13:02,totallynotTrace,ummm
02-05-2018T23:13:10,DRAGONTANOPUG,...
02-05-2018T23:13:13,totallynotTrace,social blade is slightly broken
02-05-2018T23:13:26,Vatruvius,"There are some images/art in the game that pop up while loading. Not full nudity, but you know."
02-05-2018T23:13:50,Vatruvius,"You can probably just image search ""Friday the 13th: The Game"" and see them pop up."
02-05-2018T23:14:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Enough skin to cover the kids’ eyes
02-05-2018T23:14:12,Vatruvius,I would expect them to be popular searchers for...reasons.
02-05-2018T23:14:14,DRAGONTANOPUG,You two can whisper
02-05-2018T23:14:14,totallynotTrace,"on 2018-04-18 he had -228,181 views"
02-05-2018T23:14:26,DRAGONTANOPUG,Damn
02-05-2018T23:14:29,totallynotTrace,i dont think they need to
02-05-2018T23:14:33,Vatruvius,How can you have negative views?
02-05-2018T23:14:38,totallynotTrace,idk
02-05-2018T23:14:51,totallynotTrace,https://socialblade.com/youtube/channel/UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw/monthly
02-05-2018T23:15:53,DRAGONTANOPUG,Hes dead or dying
02-05-2018T23:15:59,Vatruvius,That has to be a glitch in the system. That is not even possible.
02-05-2018T23:16:29,SpazztasticKiwi,YouTube hasn’t had itself together for a few years now
02-05-2018T23:16:54,Vatruvius,You mean when Google acquired them?
02-05-2018T23:17:01,totallynotTrace,as i said. Slightly broken
02-05-2018T23:17:51,totallynotTrace,wait social blade is owned by google?
02-05-2018T23:18:46,Vatruvius,"I do not know what Social Blade is, but Google, or rather Alphabet, owns a lot of things."
02-05-2018T23:19:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Teens are at the cornfield party. Jason’s about to have his own party
02-05-2018T23:19:08,DRAGONTANOPUG,Isnt everythIng on google owned by google..
02-05-2018T23:19:44,totallynotTrace,i just looked it up and im not seeing anythig about SB being acuired by any big company
02-05-2018T23:21:07,Vatruvius,"That is not how companies work TANO. It is a complex subject, something you will just barely touch on in economics if at all in high school."
02-05-2018T23:22:09,totallynotTrace,but it does seem that alphabet wants to own it all
02-05-2018T23:22:27,totallynotTrace,and thats not how search engines work
02-05-2018T23:25:18,totallynotTrace,@DRAGONTANOPUG this should explain how search engines work fairly well.  https://youtu.be/ADvI44Sap3g
02-05-2018T23:25:36,DRAGONTANOPUG,Ah
02-05-2018T23:26:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Gee a flaming masked guy with a machete sure does get people’s attention
02-05-2018T23:29:22,totallynotTrace,https://youtu.be/suUxA3sS2zg
02-05-2018T23:33:28,Dadrobit,Bleh.
02-05-2018T23:33:36,Dadrobit,Just finished my final exam.
02-05-2018T23:33:53,Dadrobit,2 hours for 150 questions.
02-05-2018T23:33:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Did you die?
02-05-2018T23:34:01,Dadrobit,Feeling burnt.
02-05-2018T23:34:15,Dadrobit,"No, close, but no."
02-05-2018T23:34:21,totallynotTrace,"even if you did well, I agree that exams are exeedingly bleh"

02-05-2018T23:35:11,SpazztasticKiwi,So you lived
02-05-2018T23:35:17,TheBeckoner,"Howdy, you."
02-05-2018T23:35:28,TheBeckoner,He is ghost like Bgr now.
02-05-2018T23:35:46,Bgrmystr2,:ghost::ghost::ghost:
02-05-2018T23:36:11,DRAGONTANOPUG,Well crap my phone doesnt work on picaro
02-05-2018T23:36:24,totallynotTrace,So dad and bgr are just the ghosts in the machine? errors in the code?
02-05-2018T23:36:29,Dadrobit,I feel like I need to eat something now.
02-05-2018T23:36:59,Dadrobit,"I usually don't do bad on exams, but that just felt gross."
02-05-2018T23:37:42,Dadrobit,"Brb, gonna get something to fill the void."
02-05-2018T23:39:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Dunno why but I’ve been waking up with a sore throat and fog head in the mornings
02-05-2018T23:39:51,totallynotTrace,ooh
02-05-2018T23:40:51,totallynotTrace,for some reason for the past month ive been sleeping with my mouth open and i wake up and my lips are so dry they bleed
02-05-2018T23:41:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I wear chapstick to bed
02-05-2018T23:41:45,totallynotTrace,although ill take it over the warning signs of a sore throat
02-05-2018T23:42:28,totallynotTrace,i have bad habits and bite my lip so chapstic burns
02-05-2018T23:42:43,totallynotTrace,ok not full burn
02-05-2018T23:42:49,totallynotTrace,but it stings
02-05-2018T23:43:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I use a coating chapstick
02-05-2018T23:43:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Helps if your lips are split or pealing
02-05-2018T23:43:43,totallynotTrace,oh fantastic
02-05-2018T23:43:55,Vatruvius,I use to get a sore throat from sleeping with my mouth open. It dried my throat and that is why it was soar. Not sure if that is what is happening to you but maybe. A humidify should help if this is the case.
02-05-2018T23:43:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Heals and gives moisture
02-05-2018T23:44:24,totallynotTrace,although i think my lips wouldnt bleed if i didnt bite them
02-05-2018T23:44:38,TheBeckoner,Chapstick is a wonderful thing.
02-05-2018T23:44:47,Vatruvius,That would be a wise deduction.
02-05-2018T23:45:18,totallynotTrace,Q: why am i bleeding
02-05-2018T23:45:40,totallynotTrace,A: because you just ate your skin. Duh
02-05-2018T23:47:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I used to chew my fingers
02-05-2018T23:47:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"Not just my nails, the skin around them"
02-05-2018T23:47:27,totallynotTrace,oh
02-05-2018T23:47:27,Vatruvius,Many bad habits here.
02-05-2018T23:48:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I stopped shortly after high school
02-05-2018T23:48:26,TheBeckoner,Yeah I used to too
02-05-2018T23:48:37,TheBeckoner,I stopped after 7th or so grade
02-05-2018T23:48:46,totallynotTrace,my brother teases me that i use nail clippers for my nails instead of just biting them. even after explaining this to him he doesnt understand my tooth gap is too big
02-05-2018T23:49:39,totallynotTrace,anyone else lurking that has bad habbits?
02-05-2018T23:53:10,Bgrmystr2,he teases you for being a normal person and using nail clippers..?
02-05-2018T23:53:17,Bgrmystr2,so.. could he be any more of a child :v
02-05-2018T23:53:55,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s people that lose their fingers from nail biting and infection
02-05-2018T23:54:29,Vatruvius,"No think you, I will pass on that."
02-05-2018T23:54:36,totallynotTrace,"well hes older, is in a relationship, is a dad of 2 kids, and works in construction so if teasing me for that makes him a kid.... HES A BIG KID"
02-05-2018T23:55:35,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, I stand by my statement lol"
02-05-2018T23:55:39,Bgrmystr2,xD
02-05-2018T23:56:30,Vatruvius,My dad is 51 and he acts like a huge child a lot of the time so...
02-05-2018T23:56:45,Bgrmystr2,yeh older people aren't immune to it
02-05-2018T23:56:53,Bgrmystr2,it happens
02-05-2018T23:57:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Who doesn’t have a little kid inside them?
02-05-2018T23:58:14,Bgrmystr2,that's different I feel
02-05-2018T23:58:16,totallynotTrace,voldemort
