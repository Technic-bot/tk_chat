04-12-2018T01:22:15,Twokinds,G'night!
04-12-2018T01:22:33,iliar,"Good night, Tom."
04-12-2018T01:22:46,Bgrmystr2,gnight then :)
04-12-2018T02:06:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm to bed too then I guess üõå
04-12-2018T02:52:48,CrimsonQuill,"Hah, just had breakfast. Porridge and Strawberry jam. Time zones..."
04-12-2018T02:52:59,Bgrmystr2,Hello Quill
04-12-2018T02:53:16,Bgrmystr2,"I'm not sure if you got the memo, but Raine is not a halfkind. :u"
04-12-2018T03:04:26,Dadrobit,Are people still trying to debade that? Shit's been hard confirmed that Raine is 100% human for years.
04-12-2018T03:05:39,Bgrmystr2,yes
04-12-2018T03:05:53,Bgrmystr2,the dude came in a day or two ago and claimed raine was a halfkind
04-12-2018T03:06:29,Bgrmystr2,"and posted one of the references of tom's deviantart where it shows her human, keidran, and mixed form"
04-12-2018T03:06:50,Bgrmystr2,and he just hasn't appeared in chat when I was awake for me to tell him he's wrong.
04-12-2018T03:07:00,Bgrmystr2,cuz he goes to sleep a couple hours before I wake up.
04-12-2018T03:07:53,Bgrmystr2,"and tom even confirmed what.. yesterday or the day before that she is, indeed, completely human at her base form"
04-12-2018T03:08:03,Bgrmystr2,but I don't think he even saw it
04-12-2018T03:08:53,Bgrmystr2,"wasn't much more than an hr after Quill's last message at the time, if that.. so :/"
04-12-2018T03:09:09,Bgrmystr2,"maybe you can catch him, I'm never here when he's around"
04-12-2018T03:18:26,CrimsonQuill,I'm right here.
04-12-2018T03:18:49,CrimsonQuill,"So I was wrong, eh? Interesting..."
04-12-2018T03:19:09,CrimsonQuill,I can deal with that. i still think she looks really nice in her halfway form..
04-12-2018T03:19:28,Bgrmystr2,well yeah you just got back :P
04-12-2018T03:19:42,Bgrmystr2,not online in the user list means not here
04-12-2018T03:19:47,Bgrmystr2,but welcome back
04-12-2018T03:19:59,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I won't be back for too long."
04-12-2018T03:20:10,Bgrmystr2,and yeah she does look nice half and half
04-12-2018T03:20:20,Bgrmystr2,but she's confirmed as 100% human :)
04-12-2018T03:20:25,Bgrmystr2,so you are now informed.
04-12-2018T03:20:31,CrimsonQuill,But I genuinely thought of Raine as a halfkind...I suppose it's an honest mistake.
04-12-2018T03:21:00,CrimsonQuill,I've been spending most of my time yesterday evening trying to explain the 'Halo Raine' picture to Patreon commenters...
04-12-2018T03:21:40,Bgrmystr2,bah. It's raine in halo armor. what's to explain? She was in a suit for an X-Wing not even a year or so back?
04-12-2018T03:21:44,Bgrmystr2,big deal lol
04-12-2018T03:21:58,Bgrmystr2,she turns all furry half the time in the comic and ppl worried about a power suit
04-12-2018T03:22:11,CrimsonQuill,"People kept asking why Red was a girl, or thinking she was an alternate Master CHief."
04-12-2018T03:22:42,Bgrmystr2,"who knows? It's a crossover. that's how they work. headcanons, yo"
04-12-2018T03:22:43,CrimsonQuill,"What my backstoryy explains is that she's ex-ODST, a Spartan 4, and yes, she does have her TK shapeshifting abilities."
04-12-2018T03:23:16,CrimsonQuill,It gave the UNSC techs quite a challenge designing something to account for leg and tail growth.
04-12-2018T03:24:11,CrimsonQuill,"The idea is that, at the cost of her shields, and taking off her helmet, she can use her keidran form to find invisible Elites-those with active camo are nigh impossible to detect until the energy sword comes out."
04-12-2018T03:24:45,CrimsonQuill,"That's where better hearing and smell come into play,"
04-12-2018T03:26:21,Bgrmystr2,yeah those would help huh
04-12-2018T03:27:03,CrimsonQuill,I also imagine that ONI would have tried to kidnap her from her adoptive parents for some of their experiments.
04-12-2018T03:27:48,CrimsonQuill,"Of course, they failed-I imagined her adoptive parents as UNSC military personnell, who would not only thwart the kidnappings but bring them to the public eye."

04-12-2018T12:52:52,Twokinds,Shiny variant squirrel
04-12-2018T12:53:08,CrimsonQuill,Nice!
04-12-2018T12:53:23,CrimsonQuill,Squirrels are good...at least the Red ones.
04-12-2018T12:53:35,Twokinds,I just looked out from my desk and saw a pure white squirrel wandering around on my fence.
04-12-2018T12:53:43,CrimsonQuill,Woah-pure white?
04-12-2018T12:53:55,CrimsonQuill,Now that's something I wish I could've seen.
04-12-2018T12:54:06,CrimsonQuill,Is it still there/
04-12-2018T12:54:07,CrimsonQuill,?
04-12-2018T12:54:32,Twokinds,It went into the underbrush
04-12-2018T12:54:51,CrimsonQuill,Probably looking for food...
04-12-2018T12:54:58,CrimsonQuill,It is coming close to hibernation time.
04-12-2018T12:55:29,CrimsonQuill,We have a grey Heron who sometimes perches on the fence back at my house.
04-12-2018T12:55:40,CrimsonQuill,And a buzzard.
04-12-2018T12:55:49,CrimsonQuill,Sometimes three.
04-12-2018T12:56:01,CrimsonQuill,I'd loved to have seen that squirrel though.
04-12-2018T12:57:57,Xexanoth,white squirrel? thats neat

04-12-2018T16:31:38,Twokinds,I will be streaming today

04-12-2018T16:36:26,Dadrobit,"Late to the party, but I kinda like updates during the early to mid-week. It spreads the content out better imo rather than blowing the whole load over the weekend."
04-12-2018T16:37:44,Dadrobit,"We already have Friday streams and Sunday sketches/colors, so spacing it put to posting updates during the week gives everything more time to breathe."
04-12-2018T16:38:49,Dadrobit,spacing it out*
04-12-2018T16:41:59,Bgrmystr2,comic during wed also opens Friday for extra stuff to be done as well
04-12-2018T16:43:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"If there‚Äôs a stream, I‚Äôm not out till 9 so you‚Äôll not see me till then"
04-12-2018T16:44:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless I catch it at lunch
04-12-2018T16:44:51,SpazztasticKiwi,But do the updates as comfortable for you. Bulking them too close could burn ya out
04-12-2018T16:46:07,Bgrmystr2,he likely works behind the scene almost every day anyway so
04-12-2018T16:46:13,Bgrmystr2,I'm not sure it's really relevant
04-12-2018T16:46:52,Bgrmystr2,"I just recall that wed for comic worked out nicely when he was able to keep up with it, cuz fri could be for whatever else he needed to work on"
04-12-2018T16:47:03,Bgrmystr2,"and if he needed fri for comic for w/e reason, he had it open."
04-12-2018T16:47:35,Bgrmystr2,"and plus there was a day in between if he needed rest, so it was pretty nice"

04-12-2018T21:14:12,unsteddyphoenix,His quirk is being able to see with hair over his eyes

04-12-2018T21:14:30,unsteddyphoenix,"Huh, now that's really interesting."
04-12-2018T21:14:41,CatzArt,all sorts of lore drops by tom today. I should be taking notes
04-12-2018T21:14:45,unsteddyphoenix,"Shapeshifting isnt common, and Euchre can shapeshift other people..."
04-12-2018T21:15:02,CatzArt,Trace can do it though
04-12-2018T21:15:14,CatzArt,well transform people anyway
04-12-2018T21:15:18,Twokinds,"Yeah, but doing that wasn't free. It required mana."
04-12-2018T21:15:18,unsteddyphoenix,I guess it's a matter of illusion vs actual transforms
04-12-2018T21:15:29,Twokinds,And Trace learned an imperfect version from Euchre.
04-12-2018T21:15:34,CatzArt,"what was it ""imperfect keidarian"""
04-12-2018T21:15:35,Ordithus,Trace's quirk is basically unlimited mana near as I can tell
04-12-2018T21:15:36,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah he didnt do it well lol
04-12-2018T21:15:41,CatzArt,yeah that
04-12-2018T21:15:47,CatzArt,it worked mostly
04-12-2018T21:15:52,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah that could count as his quirk, I guess. He has an absurd amount."

04-12-2018T22:18:46,Bgrmystr2,"so it would be probably Saria's decision, or at least her having a hand in why Rose is so connected to the manor."
04-12-2018T22:19:12,Ordithus,"She's the reason why Rose is there, at the very least"
04-12-2018T22:19:18,Bgrmystr2,yeah exactly
04-12-2018T22:19:25,Dadrobit,"Saria was at least on Templar grounds, so she might have been a member as well?"
04-12-2018T22:21:03,Ordithus,"I don't know for sure, but I doubt she was"
04-12-2018T22:21:25,Bgrmystr2,that is one of the things we know very little about..
04-12-2018T22:21:59,Bgrmystr2,We do know that Rose and Saria were very close.
04-12-2018T22:22:23,Ordithus,"Actually, TDM would lead me to believe she isn't a Templar"
04-12-2018T22:22:26,Twokinds,Saria was not a Templar! I can say that ^^
04-12-2018T22:22:33,unsteddyphoenix,I feel like we'd know by now if she was a templar
04-12-2018T22:22:36,Dadrobit,"I mean, she was not only someone who was important enough to invite to the Dragon Masquerade, but she had enough influence to get Rose and invite as well.?"
04-12-2018T22:22:38,unsteddyphoenix,Or even if she knew magic?
04-12-2018T22:22:47,Dadrobit,So she was someone though.
04-12-2018T22:23:01,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, some sort of pampered noble"
04-12-2018T22:23:04,Ordithus,Some Blacksmith's daughter
04-12-2018T22:23:18,unsteddyphoenix,Hell of a blacksmith
04-12-2018T22:23:18,Twokinds,"Saria lived near the Templar college, and was the daughter of a promonent blacksmith."
04-12-2018T22:23:28,Twokinds,The blacksmith provided arms to the Templar.
04-12-2018T22:23:36,Bgrmystr2,"Ay, tom appeared with lore"
04-12-2018T22:23:39,Dadrobit,She was the daughter of Reni.
04-12-2018T22:23:48,unsteddyphoenix,Huh. Well there we go
04-12-2018T22:23:55,Bgrmystr2,lol dadro pls
04-12-2018T22:23:58,unsteddyphoenix,did he make...magic weapons or something like that?
04-12-2018T22:23:59,Twokinds,lol
04-12-2018T22:24:28,SpazztasticKiwi,He made costume jewelry that the important people found shiny
04-12-2018T22:24:38,Twokinds,Uh... I didn't consider. Probably just regular type weapons.
04-12-2018T22:24:46,Ordithus,":ctwokinds-reniembarrassed: ""It's really weird to be mother to someone older than myself"""
04-12-2018T22:25:05,Dadrobit,Do we know Reni's age?
04-12-2018T22:25:06,Bgrmystr2,"I am guessing.. the rest of the stuff, the reason Rose is attached to the manor and whether it has to do with Saria.. it's all spoilers isn't it?"
04-12-2018T22:25:14,Twokinds,I imagine the Templar probably have their own department for enchanting and engraving magics.
04-12-2018T22:25:24,Twokinds,"Yeah, Reni is 20."
04-12-2018T22:25:27,unsteddyphoenix,"Templar are synonimus with ""magic"" in my mind"
04-12-2018T22:25:35,unsteddyphoenix,"But yeah, good point"
04-12-2018T22:25:44,Twokinds,She's younger than Trace.
04-12-2018T22:25:52,unsteddyphoenix,Shes younger than ME
04-12-2018T22:26:01,Dadrobit,"Ah, yeah, that makes my tie-in a little less plausible."
04-12-2018T22:26:05,unsteddyphoenix,Thats the biggest twist
04-12-2018T22:26:10,Bgrmystr2,haha
04-12-2018T22:26:16,Bgrmystr2,she's a youngin
04-12-2018T22:26:24,unsteddyphoenix,A dragon who's younger than regular humans
04-12-2018T22:26:28,unsteddyphoenix,Unheard of in fantasy
04-12-2018T22:26:58,Twokinds,"You always here things like dragons say stuff like ""Oh yeah I'm super young. Just 200 years old."" So I thought it would be funny to just have her say ""I'm 20."""
04-12-2018T22:27:20,Bgrmystr2,xD
04-12-2018T22:27:26,Ordithus,"It was in a comic page, guys"
04-12-2018T22:27:30,Bgrmystr2,literally a baby
04-12-2018T22:27:36,Dadrobit,1016. Found it.
04-12-2018T22:27:52,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah that threw me for a loop
04-12-2018T22:28:09,unsteddyphoenix,Next we'll get an elf that looks 12 and IS 12
04-12-2018T22:28:16,Dadrobit,"I remembered her talking about the bloodline, wasn't totally all there with the age."
04-12-2018T22:28:49,unsteddyphoenix,Howd you miss that twist
04-12-2018T22:29:04,Dadrobit,My age is catching up to me.
04-12-2018T22:29:14,RimaDraws,what

04-12-2018T22:30:06,Bgrmystr2,like mid late 20s
04-12-2018T22:30:22,Dadrobit,"I'll give you a hint. When I speak, it sounds like optimus prime having a stroke after changing his voice box with a grinding stone."
04-12-2018T22:30:30,RimaDraws,50 some?
04-12-2018T22:30:32,RimaDraws,40?
04-12-2018T22:30:39,Bgrmystr2,I literally just said.. but okay

04-12-2018T22:35:20,Dadrobit,Ohhhhh~ Yeah. Pulled my first white hair our of the chin a week ago.
04-12-2018T22:35:33,RimaDraws,i had two white hairs in my life that fell out
04-12-2018T22:35:51,RimaDraws,but my hair is still a dark brown
04-12-2018T22:36:08,Ordithus,"I feel lucky.  I don't know of any grey hairs, and I've still got hair"
04-12-2018T22:36:15,Dadrobit,Gonna have to get some silver fox hair dyes going in a few years here...
04-12-2018T22:36:27,RimaDraws,oh my word
04-12-2018T22:36:30,RimaDraws,most of that is stress

04-12-2018T22:37:36,Twokinds,I'm 62

04-12-2018T22:44:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Ive heard it‚Äôs more like grape juice that burns
04-12-2018T22:44:44,Dadrobit,"Spazz, that 100% is a case of ""it depends"""
04-12-2018T22:45:01,Ordithus,"The cheap stuff, sure.  But good wine is made of tasty"
