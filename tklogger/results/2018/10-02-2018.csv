10-02-2018T04:06:58,JaydenMozingo,Man. It's been quiet in chat today.
10-02-2018T08:28:10,MWF,Hi
10-02-2018T13:13:54,Twokinds,Goood morning
10-02-2018T13:14:11,wolfspartan1,ello tom
10-02-2018T13:15:51,iliar,"Hi, Tom."
10-02-2018T13:22:17,Combak,"Hi everyone, Tom."
10-02-2018T13:22:23,wolfspartan1,ello
10-02-2018T13:22:29,Combak,"Nice weather we're having, eh?"
10-02-2018T13:23:06,wolfspartan1,no
10-02-2018T13:23:09,wolfspartan1,lol
10-02-2018T13:29:19,Combak,Exactly. :p
10-02-2018T13:29:50,wolfspartan1,it's raining and fogy here
10-02-2018T13:45:12,Combak,Similar here.
10-02-2018T13:45:25,Combak,"At least, it was that way this morning. Still overcast."
10-02-2018T13:45:49,wolfspartan1,i just wish it was summer already
10-02-2018T13:52:04,Twokinds,"It's foggy, overcast, and rainy here"
10-02-2018T13:52:06,Twokinds,I love it
10-02-2018T13:52:09,Twokinds,It's my favorite weather.
10-02-2018T13:53:58,Combak,Because it gives you the perfect reason not to go outside? :p
10-02-2018T13:58:29,iliar,Perfect reason not to go outside is snow. You do not have to go outside if you can not open the door. https://s00.yaplakal.com/pics/pics_original/4/5/7/4300754.jpg
10-02-2018T13:59:46,Twokinds,I need no excuse to not go outside.
10-02-2018T13:59:53,RedDeath2018,Hey guys
10-02-2018T14:00:15,wolfspartan1,ello red
10-02-2018T14:00:31,Twokinds,I just like the rain. I can have my windows open without the sunlight blinding me.
10-02-2018T14:00:46,RedDeath2018,lol
10-02-2018T14:01:04,RedDeath2018,Rainy weather is perfect weather to take a nap
10-02-2018T14:01:23,wolfspartan1,i agree red
10-02-2018T14:02:41,RedDeath2018,Well lay minute plans were made
10-02-2018T14:02:46,RedDeath2018,Last*
10-02-2018T14:02:50,RedDeath2018,Gtg
10-02-2018T14:03:07,RedDeath2018,My friends invited me to their house
10-02-2018T14:03:16,RedDeath2018,See y’all later if I can
10-02-2018T14:03:22,wolfspartan1,cya

10-02-2018T14:05:07,RedDeath2018,Bye guys
10-02-2018T14:07:29,Twokinds,"""Maddie and Maggie""??"
10-02-2018T14:12:24,Twokinds,"""Keni""??"
10-02-2018T14:13:23,Combak,Some people...
10-02-2018T14:19:06,Combak,"New rule for suggestions: It is not Tom's job to figure out what you mean. If it isn't clear, it gets tossed out. :p"
10-02-2018T14:19:18,Combak,"... That's probably already a rule, isn't it?"
10-02-2018T14:19:56,Twokinds,Yes
10-02-2018T14:20:13,Twokinds,Though I'm going to assume they meant Maddie and Maeve and the other guy meant Reni
10-02-2018T14:20:28,Twokinds,I wish people would proofread their suggestions xD
10-02-2018T14:20:36,Combak,"Yeah, those are the reasonable conclusions."
10-02-2018T14:20:52,Combak,It could be auto-correct trying to be helpful.
10-02-2018T14:21:29,iliar,"Maybe this is an translator mistake? In different languages, the names sound different. Perhaps someone translated Maeve as Maggie."
10-02-2018T14:21:39,iliar,It sounds unconvincing. But this is the best explanation then I can find.
10-02-2018T14:22:10,Twokinds,I suppose but I personally never submit anything without dablecheking which is why I never make mistacks.
10-02-2018T14:22:53,Combak,Ha.
10-02-2018T14:23:09,Combak,Intention errors are obvious.
10-02-2018T14:23:21,Twokinds,"""Natanie""??"

10-02-2018T14:41:33,wolfspartan1,wish it was 70 but eh
10-02-2018T14:42:00,NightMeaty22,70 = warm rain and warm fog
10-02-2018T14:42:24,NightMeaty22,That would be the best
10-02-2018T14:42:35,wolfspartan1,yess
10-02-2018T14:43:06,NightMeaty22,A shower in the warm rain is the best shower
10-02-2018T14:46:13,wolfspartan1,i like to watch it rain
10-02-2018T14:50:17,wolfspartan1,then after it rains i look for dear and fox prints

10-02-2018T14:57:53,wolfspartan1,yea it sucks then
10-02-2018T14:59:23,NightMeaty22,Mountan + thick fog + no people = good day
10-02-2018T15:01:35,wolfspartan1,i wouldn't drive up a mountan in thick fog

10-02-2018T15:16:57,JaydenMozingo,How are you this fine morning?
10-02-2018T15:17:47,Twokinds,Fantastic!
10-02-2018T15:18:11,qwe304,"I thought of a way you could open up nora cards to new teople tom,  you could remove the tier from the parteon, then quickly re-make it, i beleive it would end the subscription of those at the tier, and allow new people to try"
10-02-2018T15:20:02,NightMeaty22,I have to do some work
10-02-2018T15:20:13,NightMeaty22,Hi tom
10-02-2018T15:20:38,JaydenMozingo,Oof
10-02-2018T15:21:05,NightMeaty22,Oof indeed
10-02-2018T15:21:42,JaydenMozingo,"Well, good luck my friend."
10-02-2018T15:22:11,NightMeaty22,I hate working for my dad cuz i have to work when i have more stuff to do
10-02-2018T15:22:33,PalmettoPathfinder1,"I'm doing good.  Just doing laundry, reading about Sergals (actually read about them back in college but never got around to learning more about them), and waiting for my mom to call me to invite me over for dinner."
10-02-2018T15:23:05,NightMeaty22,I work all summer
10-02-2018T15:23:09,NightMeaty22,Rip
10-02-2018T15:23:17,iliar,@qwe304 I went to edit my bot so that he would monitor this situation and subscribe again.
10-02-2018T15:25:08,NeonMitsumi,Talk about a Nora Card holder.
10-02-2018T15:25:43,qwe304,"if tom did want new people to get the cards, i dont think he would take too kindly to that"
10-02-2018T15:26:16,qwe304,eg: the bot cant resubscribe if the account is blocked
10-02-2018T15:27:26,Twokinds,I don't want to sweep the rug out from under people like that.
10-02-2018T15:28:23,qwe304,you could make an announcement on the page...
10-02-2018T15:30:01,iliar,Phhh... Create new account... It's not too hard.
10-02-2018T15:30:25,NeonMitsumi,"Lol, you really like that Nora Card, ha?"
10-02-2018T15:31:20,qwe304,pretty sure patreon tells creators how old the accounts that subcribe are
10-02-2018T15:33:43,qwe304,or he could just not do your sketch
10-02-2018T15:34:34,iliar,And so what? For new accounts do not allow to be subscribed?
10-02-2018T15:35:12,FenceEqualizer,Kind of a silly thing to argue about just let the man exchange currency for goods. If Tom wants to open it up he will.
10-02-2018T15:36:02,iliar,I'm not sure that the patron will approve this.
10-02-2018T15:36:23,Bespin,Hey gamers

10-02-2018T15:39:45,NeonMitsumi,"To be fair, they are cracking down on bots that sub immediately to the highest tier."

10-02-2018T20:40:13,Dadrobit,Actually coming up on my 9 year anniversary of beaking my back! Feb 15!
10-02-2018T20:40:23,Ordithus,Congrats?
10-02-2018T20:40:24,Dadrobit,\o/
10-02-2018T20:40:34,Bgrmystr2,"lol, but that'd due to injury, yes?"
10-02-2018T20:40:41,Ordithus,I managed to vote while waiting for my car to warm up.  I am quite pleased :)
10-02-2018T20:40:48,MidnightBlue78,i have scoliosis
10-02-2018T20:40:54,MidnightBlue78,Does that count?
10-02-2018T20:40:58,Bgrmystr2,yeah
10-02-2018T20:41:01,Bgrmystr2,that counts
10-02-2018T20:41:03,Bgrmystr2,my dad's got scholiosis too
10-02-2018T20:41:07,Bgrmystr2,his is REALLY bad
10-02-2018T20:41:27,Dadrobit,"I mean, can you break your back and not call it an injury?"
10-02-2018T20:41:28,Bgrmystr2,"I've got it from him, not as bad as him though, thankfully"
10-02-2018T20:42:03,MidnightBlue78,if you break your back its definitely an injury
10-02-2018T20:42:07,Bgrmystr2,"well, it's not like scholiosis where you were both with it and have to live with it your whole life"
10-02-2018T20:42:14,FenceEqualizer,We'll just call it a life experience
10-02-2018T20:42:22,Bgrmystr2,"breaking your back sucks, but it'll heal"
10-02-2018T20:42:24,Dadrobit,"Trust me, I'm iving with it still."
10-02-2018T20:42:28,Dadrobit,living
10-02-2018T20:42:44,Bgrmystr2,though I guess it depends on how bad it was

10-02-2018T20:50:03,w0lfmare,Outside is a cruel cruel world
10-02-2018T20:50:03,Dadrobit,"Noooooo, w0lf!"
10-02-2018T20:50:03,Ordithus,I was outside just a few minutes ago.  I barely made it
10-02-2018T20:50:22,unsteddyphoenix,Did you survive?
10-02-2018T20:50:24,MidnightBlue78,i got chased by geese
10-02-2018T20:50:31,Ordithus,I almost froze to death
10-02-2018T20:50:38,Ordithus,"But I got my Udon, so it's worth it"
10-02-2018T20:51:41,Terryschannel,Did tom finish all the sketchs?
10-02-2018T20:52:16,Xexanoth,"nope, he stopped partway of sketch 6 because he had stuff to do"
10-02-2018T20:53:48,MidnightBlue78,"Oh, and outside a gecko fell on my arm that one time"
10-02-2018T20:54:07,Ordithus,"That actually sounds pretty cool, midnight"
10-02-2018T20:54:15,MidnightBlue78,I still have not recovered from that incident
10-02-2018T20:54:20,NightMeaty22,I got stung in the eye by a hornet
10-02-2018T20:54:28,MidnightBlue78,Not when you have a phobia of geckos
10-02-2018T20:54:32,unsteddyphoenix,The gecko stole her wallet tho
10-02-2018T20:54:37,MidnightBlue78,and lizards
10-02-2018T20:54:39,Ordithus,But geckos are adorable lizards
10-02-2018T20:55:11,MidnightBlue78,the memories are too fresh in my mind
10-02-2018T20:55:30,Ordithus,A seagull once stole my pretzel
10-02-2018T20:55:49,MidnightBlue78,It felt like a gummy worm hitting my arm

10-02-2018T20:57:24,MidnightBlue78,the thing is i knew what it was immediately as it happened
10-02-2018T20:57:59,MidnightBlue78,"yeah, i guess i did"
10-02-2018T20:58:52,Ordithus,My sister had a gecko in her apartment when she was in China.  It ate the bugs.
10-02-2018T20:59:19,unsteddyphoenix,Smart
10-02-2018T21:00:06,MidnightBlue78,but thats what bug repellent is for

10-02-2018T21:00:51,Ordithus,It wouldn't anyways.  It wasn't a pet.  It was just some wild gecko that moved in
10-02-2018T21:01:09,Ordithus,It earned its keep
10-02-2018T21:01:15,unsteddyphoenix,Idk this gecko soundin cute

10-02-2018T22:53:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"Still gonna monitor Bagheera like a first time mother till he’s over it, too. Especially since he’s a black cat; people around here..."
10-02-2018T22:54:33,unsteddyphoenix,Smothering cats with affection they may not want is my aesthetic anyway so
10-02-2018T22:54:45,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds good :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
10-02-2018T22:55:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"You must show them how much you love them. They can’t speak English, after all"
10-02-2018T22:55:39,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, as far as we know."
10-02-2018T22:55:46,Bgrmystr2,"Phoenix, why is it that you can't get another cat after your first one died?"
10-02-2018T22:55:57,Bgrmystr2,they implement a no pets rule or something?
10-02-2018T22:56:17,unsteddyphoenix,Basically that was the deal with the landlord
10-02-2018T22:56:39,unsteddyphoenix,"THey wanted no pets, but we already had one so they were like ""fine but you cant get another one"""
10-02-2018T22:57:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Sounds a little petty
10-02-2018T22:57:24,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: you guys didn't get one that looked similar, gave it the same name, and then tell the landlord that's the same cat?"
10-02-2018T22:57:36,Bgrmystr2,I mean..
10-02-2018T22:57:56,unsteddyphoenix,"Lol, I think that would be...too depressing."
10-02-2018T22:58:04,Bgrmystr2,"I can understand the no-pet rule, but yknow.."
10-02-2018T22:58:05,Bgrmystr2,ehh
10-02-2018T22:59:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I think that’s why i had issues finding an apartment. Too many “no pets”
10-02-2018T22:59:52,unsteddyphoenix,There are seriously a lot
10-02-2018T23:00:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"It’s understandable, but depressing"
10-02-2018T23:00:26,Bgrmystr2,Apartment owners tend to have to clean up after tennants cuz ppl can't take care of their pets worth a shit
10-02-2018T23:00:54,Bgrmystr2,and it's too costly to take legal action usually
10-02-2018T23:01:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I hear you there. I know of a few stories
10-02-2018T23:01:00,Bgrmystr2,"at least here, anyway"
10-02-2018T23:01:37,Bgrmystr2,it would cost less to just hire someone to clean the shit up out of pocket than it would to pay the legal fees to get the person who did it to clean up their own damn mess.
10-02-2018T23:01:53,Bgrmystr2,sad as hell
10-02-2018T23:02:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"Sorry about your cat, unsteddy."
10-02-2018T23:02:48,Bgrmystr2,"it's just that people don't take responsibility for their pets, and that's why there's the no pets rule everywhere, which super sucks cuz pets are awesome"
10-02-2018T23:03:07,Bgrmystr2,everyone loses out because of a select shitty few.
10-02-2018T23:03:13,unsteddyphoenix,"Thanks, sorry about your strings of bad luck~"
10-02-2018T23:03:27,Bgrmystr2,"One day you'll get a cat, phoenix"
10-02-2018T23:03:40,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah the only reason we got our place was 'cause our cat was already well-behaved
10-02-2018T23:04:04,unsteddyphoenix,My friends just got a puppy and it pees EVERYWHERE in their hourse
10-02-2018T23:04:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"Another thing about the pets rule is that it’s primarily to cover cats and dogs, or something like a hamster"
10-02-2018T23:04:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"When I was searching, I still had my snake"
10-02-2018T23:05:11,unsteddyphoenix,"Are snakes a problem? I mean, they stay in a glass cage right?"
10-02-2018T23:05:32,Bgrmystr2,"One day in the future.. :cat: you'll have a little fluffball and it'll be just as lazy and decrepit as you are, phoenix. Just gotta get there."
10-02-2018T23:05:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"Yeah, but I cane across the concern “other tenants may not like it”"
10-02-2018T23:05:52,unsteddyphoenix,"Hah, that's the dream~"
10-02-2018T23:06:11,unsteddyphoenix,Literally 2018 and still snake-discrimination tsk tsk
10-02-2018T23:06:18,Bgrmystr2,lol..
10-02-2018T23:07:13,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s still discrimination against black cats for God’s sake. I wasn’t supposed to keep Bagheera. The no kill shelter didn’t want him because he’s black!
10-02-2018T23:07:19,Dadrobit,Snakes are pretty neat-o
10-02-2018T23:07:21,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/QRwA7Mz.jpg
10-02-2018T23:07:26,unsteddyphoenix,Thats actually ridiculous\
10-02-2018T23:07:40,unsteddyphoenix,what a cool dood
10-02-2018T23:07:48,Bgrmystr2,"""Today.. the  tenant next door got a pet shark for their aquarium inside their apartment.. How the fuck they did it, I dunno.. but every night I keep hearing it hitting the wall next to my bed.. Attemping to come and eat me"""
10-02-2018T23:07:50,Dadrobit,"""Little"" brother"
10-02-2018T23:08:25,Bgrmystr2,"lol, snakes can be cool as hell"
10-02-2018T23:09:05,Bgrmystr2,I saw a video of a snake hanging out on a couch w/ a lil girl and they're just chilling and watching tv.
10-02-2018T23:09:28,Bgrmystr2,lotta ppl were surprised that snakes watch tv xD
10-02-2018T23:09:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"King was a chill snake. Couldn’t aim for his food on the feeding tongs worth anything, but a good snake"
10-02-2018T23:09:50,SpazztasticKiwi,He watched YouTube with me
10-02-2018T23:10:38,Bgrmystr2,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXbAPwrc_Rg
10-02-2018T23:10:41,Bgrmystr2,There it is ^
10-02-2018T23:10:47,Bgrmystr2,It wasn't the one I originally saw but
10-02-2018T23:10:51,Bgrmystr2,it's basically everywhere
10-02-2018T23:10:58,Bgrmystr2,"the video, I mean"
10-02-2018T23:11:04,Bgrmystr2,I don't recall where I first saw it
10-02-2018T23:13:25,Dadrobit,Gonna head off for a bit. Really do need to do homework...
10-02-2018T23:13:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"I saw it on my fb feed once. It’s everywhere because people are worried, like the kid’s not being monitored"
10-02-2018T23:14:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"It’s like, dude, they’re not always in kill mode. The kid doesn’t look like a mouse"
10-02-2018T23:15:01,unsteddyphoenix,good luck dad
10-02-2018T23:15:11,Bgrmystr2,"""Not being monitored"" Who the fuck is making the video then? rofl"
10-02-2018T23:15:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Have fun with that homework 😁
10-02-2018T23:15:19,Bgrmystr2,people are stupid XD
10-02-2018T23:15:33,unsteddyphoenix,"Dont they like, de-fang snakes or somethin?"
10-02-2018T23:15:37,Bgrmystr2,possibly
10-02-2018T23:16:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Non venomous snakes don’t have fangs
10-02-2018T23:16:52,unsteddyphoenix,fair play
10-02-2018T23:17:18,unsteddyphoenix,Well I personally have nothing against noodleboys
10-02-2018T23:19:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Same
10-02-2018T23:20:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"Last bf gave me one for our anniversary, but it got out of its transfer container"
10-02-2018T23:21:07,Ordithus,It ate three villagers before its rampage could be stopped
10-02-2018T23:21:32,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
10-02-2018T23:21:34,SpazztasticKiwi,It was a 6 inch baby ringneck snake
10-02-2018T23:21:49,unsteddyphoenix,Luckily they were baby villagers
10-02-2018T23:21:55,unsteddyphoenix,So it worked out
10-02-2018T23:22:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"This same bf didn’t get along with Kiwi, and we eventually broke up, so"
10-02-2018T23:23:10,unsteddyphoenix,Shouldve broken up with him as soon as you saw he didnt get along with cat
10-02-2018T23:23:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"Kiwi HATES men, and I don’t know why"
10-02-2018T23:23:41,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, we are pigs I guess?"
10-02-2018T23:24:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"I think it’s because we don’t have any in the house hold, and the lady that gave her up to me had a son that gave me “vibes”, if you know what I mean"
10-02-2018T23:25:54,unsteddyphoenix,Also maybe shes jealous of anyone that takes your attention away from her¬
10-02-2018T23:26:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"That’s a big possibility. If I call any other name in the house, especially Bagheera, she runs to me"
10-02-2018T23:27:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"“No, my lap. I am the only one allowed in it.”"
10-02-2018T23:27:47,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-daydreamingkat: I love that~
10-02-2018T23:28:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"It’s precious. And since that last bf, I’ve stopped looking for a relationship outright and I just have some simple guidelines"
10-02-2018T23:30:17,SpazztasticKiwi,It starts with “my cats and I are a package deal. Like me? Like them.”
10-02-2018T23:30:53,unsteddyphoenix,very reasonable
10-02-2018T23:30:55,unsteddyphoenix,Should be obvious
10-02-2018T23:31:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"Everything else is pretty negotiable, but I’d also like someone who likes art and drawing, too"
10-02-2018T23:32:30,unsteddyphoenix,"So one guideline, really"
10-02-2018T23:32:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"And is WITHIN my age range. I’ve had 40 year olds, a married man, and currently have a teenager hit on me"
10-02-2018T23:33:23,MidnightBlue78,I can relatebon one of those
10-02-2018T23:33:30,MidnightBlue78,*relate
10-02-2018T23:33:44,MidnightBlue78,"Sorry, I've been lurking"
10-02-2018T23:34:32,unsteddyphoenix,currently?
10-02-2018T23:34:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"It’s fine, jump in anytime you have an opinion. I am a chatterbox if you can’t tell 😜"
10-02-2018T23:35:05,unsteddyphoenix,"I cant relate, ive only had men my own age hit on me~"
10-02-2018T23:35:29,MidnightBlue78,really?
10-02-2018T23:35:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"Yes, currently. Tom has a brother, Mark, right? Well Mark has a fandom that I and this kid is a part of"
10-02-2018T23:36:12,MidnightBlue78,"And how old are you, if you dont mind me asking?"
10-02-2018T23:36:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"This kid has been very obvious that as fellow fans, it’d be cool to date"
10-02-2018T23:37:07,MidnightBlue78,"So, you just date him online?"
10-02-2018T23:37:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’m 21. He’s almost 18, but this started when I was 19 and he was 16"
10-02-2018T23:37:42,MidnightBlue78,the age difference is not much
10-02-2018T23:37:49,unsteddyphoenix,Hoo~ he's dedicated
10-02-2018T23:38:05,MidnightBlue78,he's almost an adult
10-02-2018T23:38:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"No, he’s from my area. When I was dating my last bf that Kiwi didn’t like, I went to Jacks with my fam to eat."
10-02-2018T23:38:17,unsteddyphoenix,heheh
10-02-2018T23:38:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"He worked there, and greeted with me with a hug and kiss"
10-02-2018T23:39:10,unsteddyphoenix,Is he european?
10-02-2018T23:39:14,unsteddyphoenix,If not...
10-02-2018T23:39:26,SpazztasticKiwi,We’re both American
10-02-2018T23:39:56,MidnightBlue78,"well, go out with the poor bastard already"
10-02-2018T23:40:06,MidnightBlue78,What are you waiting for?
10-02-2018T23:40:14,MidnightBlue78,Make him happy
10-02-2018T23:40:20,unsteddyphoenix,The age difference matters less and less over time~
10-02-2018T23:41:40,MidnightBlue78,Depends on how many years though
10-02-2018T23:42:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"I was interested at one point, but that faded when he told me he was turning 18 when he was actually turning 17. Yes, that’s not a lot, but age of consent had me worried"
10-02-2018T23:43:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, I was dating someone else, he knew and he still greeted me the way he did."
10-02-2018T23:44:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"And to be honest, I’m not as interested anymore. To me, he’s been a little pushy about it. He’s made me uncomfortable"
10-02-2018T23:44:53,MidnightBlue78,"well in that case, screw him"
10-02-2018T23:44:57,unsteddyphoenix,Very confident teen.
10-02-2018T23:46:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"Not really. He’s actually really awkward, that’s why I’ve been so forgiving about that greeting. I don’t want to be mean, but it bothers me at the same time"
10-02-2018T23:47:20,unsteddyphoenix,Understandable
10-02-2018T23:47:33,MidnightBlue78,dont waste your time with that one
10-02-2018T23:48:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"He’s currently joined the marines. And he seems to be doing so much better now, more upbeat and respectable"
10-02-2018T23:49:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t know if I want to risk chatting up with him again though
10-02-2018T23:49:35,unsteddyphoenix,plenty of snakes in the grass
10-02-2018T23:50:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"I know. Like I said, I’m waiting for one to catch my eye and spoil my cats"
10-02-2018T23:50:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"I once said I was going to marry a vet. That way, my cats would get free health care"
10-02-2018T23:51:28,unsteddyphoenix,Now youre thining
10-02-2018T23:52:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Thank you for listening

10-02-2018T23:53:53,unsteddyphoenix,Id rather be talked at
10-02-2018T23:54:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"Oh, I can talk. It’s one of my best traits. But sometimes I feel I ramble. Especially about my favorite thing, YouTube"
10-02-2018T23:56:37,unsteddyphoenix,smash that mfin like button~
10-02-2018T23:57:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I high five it with Jacksepticeye
