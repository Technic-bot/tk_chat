31-08-2018T01:13:01,SageSaga,"and he was like ""In two nights im going to start eating you all and driving you insane so you'll kill each other!"""
31-08-2018T01:13:49,SageSaga,"and Lann was freaking out and was like ""Wait- if we kill someone, Mr Clown, do we get to live?"" and the clown just cackled and vanished"

31-08-2018T01:14:42,SageSaga,"and everyone was like ""What are we going to do?"" and i was just like ""Well he said 2 nights right? The colony is leaving tomorrow so its not a problem. Just dont do anything stupid"""
31-08-2018T01:15:15,SageSaga,"and Lann was like ""I DUNNO IF I CAN DO THAT MAN!"""
31-08-2018T01:16:22,SageSaga,"and i was like ""Fine, if the clown comes back just hit it with a shovel"" and i gave him a shovel- it immediately appeared behind him and started going ""BOOGA BOOGA BOOGA!"" and Lann decapitated it with the shovel"
31-08-2018T01:16:47,FenceEqualizer,Pennywise is off its game apparently
31-08-2018T01:16:47,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
31-08-2018T01:17:07,SageSaga,"and then he got kinda creepy because he started talking about how ""Hey- if you kill your problems, they go away"""
31-08-2018T01:17:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll have an order of what Sage got a hold of
31-08-2018T01:17:30,Bgrmystr2,"yeah.. I'll pass on that one, kiwi"
31-08-2018T01:18:25,Mihari,There has been weirder ones.
31-08-2018T01:18:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I JUST STEPPED ON GLASS
31-08-2018T01:18:43,SageSaga,Tom then said he doesnt think that's healthy and Mihari took the shovel from Lann and smacked him with it
31-08-2018T01:18:55,Mihari,Sounds legit.
31-08-2018T01:19:00,SpazztasticKiwi,NM I got it out
31-08-2018T01:19:07,unsteddyphoenix,How do you remember so much of your dreams
31-08-2018T01:19:13,Bgrmystr2,xD sage
31-08-2018T01:19:16,unsteddyphoenix,And why is it a slapstick comedy lol
31-08-2018T01:19:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Kiwi why you step?
31-08-2018T01:19:33,SageSaga,so then it came time for us to leave and we got the whole building to fly away with giant rockets
31-08-2018T01:19:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Well if you crack him over the head with the shovel he’ll stop talking about wanting burritos so it sounds like a reasonable reaction
31-08-2018T01:20:03,SageSaga,and we just told people not to go to that planet because it had a space clown on it
31-08-2018T01:20:33,SpazztasticKiwi,“We’re gonna need the sanitarium on speed dial”
31-08-2018T01:20:45,FenceEqualizer,Soundslike one vividly fever dream. :ptv-laugh:
31-08-2018T01:20:58,SageSaga,I still think the Iguana wearing stockings was my best weird dream though
31-08-2018T01:21:06,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s like the radiation from the computer is catching up to you
31-08-2018T01:22:43,SageSaga,well i have been using computers since i was like 2 years old
31-08-2018T01:23:22,SageSaga,but how do you know your dreams arent as weird as mine?
31-08-2018T01:23:36,Mihari,I fear more for the current gen with them sticking with cell phones and wireless all the time XD
31-08-2018T01:23:50,neropan,"all right everyone i'll stop ehre , the coughing is really getting annoying here"
31-08-2018T01:24:04,Mihari,"Take care nero, and thanks for the stream!"

31-08-2018T01:25:30,Sammit,Thanks for the stream Nero
31-08-2018T01:26:15,SpazztasticKiwi,The weirdest dreams I’ve had were about Mark and jack and the only reason they were weird is because dream Mark didn’t know who Tom was and dream Jack imploded right in front of me
31-08-2018T01:26:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless you count the dream I had were I was getting married with my dead dad walking me down the aisle
31-08-2018T01:27:26,SageSaga,that you know of
31-08-2018T01:27:29,FenceEqualizer,Dad approval from beyond the grave
31-08-2018T01:32:33,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s the odd thing. I don’t think there’s a soul on earth he would’ve approved of. Ever
31-08-2018T01:32:46,SpazztasticKiwi,He’d sooner see me become a nun
31-08-2018T01:33:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,like the one in blues brothers?
31-08-2018T01:33:09,SpazztasticKiwi,The what
31-08-2018T01:33:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,the nun in blues brothers
31-08-2018T01:34:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I dunno
31-08-2018T01:34:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,that nun was a badass
31-08-2018T01:34:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Just as long as I lived as a single woman with no male contact
31-08-2018T01:34:33,SpazztasticKiwi,That was his dream
31-08-2018T01:35:03,unsteddyphoenix,common dad fantasy
31-08-2018T01:35:07,FenceEqualizer,Sounds about right
31-08-2018T01:36:11,SpazztasticKiwi,“Why was he talking to you? What did he say?”
31-08-2018T01:36:20,SpazztasticKiwi,“He asked me for the time.”
31-08-2018T01:36:51,SpazztasticKiwi,“Is ThAt A EuPhAmIsM?”
31-08-2018T01:36:56,SpazztasticKiwi,No chill
31-08-2018T01:37:23,Bgrmystr2,haha
31-08-2018T01:38:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Admittedly it wasn’t that kind of conversation but he was a bit paranoid
31-08-2018T01:38:25,FenceEqualizer,Protective dad is protective
31-08-2018T01:38:29,SpazztasticKiwi,“All men are evil”
31-08-2018T01:38:33,SpazztasticKiwi,“Sure dad”
31-08-2018T01:38:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Protective dad doing his job
31-08-2018T01:38:40,Bgrmystr2,aw kiwi
31-08-2018T01:38:42,unsteddyphoenix,No he's right
31-08-2018T01:40:32,FenceEqualizer,BUsted out one of my old dream journals. One I remember was a bunch of dark hooded figures surrounding my Mom but luckily she had pet lions . I attempted to help her but one of the Kobolds attempted to assassinate me. Luckily I was a TF2 sniper.
31-08-2018T01:41:20,unsteddyphoenix,Man I want pet lions
31-08-2018T01:41:24,unsteddyphoenix,Your moms cool
31-08-2018T01:41:30,FenceEqualizer,"I attacked by attempting to club the dark hooded figure, I missed barely but exposed it as a Kolbold. It tried to shank me but my dad came over and Karate chopped it to death."
31-08-2018T01:41:40,SpazztasticKiwi,🦁 🦁 🦁 here
31-08-2018T01:41:58,FenceEqualizer,"He then turned to me, pat me on the head proudly and said ""Your head is not flat son"" What the hell was my dream."
31-08-2018T01:42:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Pretty sure you fervor dreamed into a past life
31-08-2018T01:42:36,SpazztasticKiwi,* fever
31-08-2018T01:42:56,unsteddyphoenix,dreamed with fervor
31-08-2018T01:43:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Fervor, the best story teller"
31-08-2018T01:43:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Right up there with alcohol
31-08-2018T01:43:45,FenceEqualizer,The best story teller.
31-08-2018T01:43:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,and those shrooms my dad pointed out the last time we we're up in the hills
31-08-2018T01:44:08,FenceEqualizer,I'm reading through this and so much of it is gibberish XD
31-08-2018T01:44:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I kinda wonder how I’d be like buzzed
31-08-2018T01:44:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Or high
31-08-2018T01:44:50,SpazztasticKiwi,But also...not a good idea
31-08-2018T01:45:02,FenceEqualizer,Depends on his personality.
31-08-2018T01:45:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I'v have not been either, seeing how I am normally high or buzzed me would be a threat to others way of life"
31-08-2018T01:45:51,FenceEqualizer,Hugs would become bear hugs.
31-08-2018T01:45:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"Had a friend tell me since I’m so hyper and chatty normally, I’d be chill af drunk or high"
31-08-2018T01:45:57,Bgrmystr2,"always remember, Fence. Your head is not flat."
31-08-2018T01:46:04,Bgrmystr2,Important information.
31-08-2018T01:46:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I already give bear hugs fence

31-08-2018T01:55:11,SageSaga,Hoshiguma Yuugi is pretty cool looking

31-08-2018T03:13:42,Bgrmystr2,I don't know
31-08-2018T03:13:51,unsteddyphoenix,How do you bite your tongue so hard it bleeds lol
31-08-2018T03:14:07,Bgrmystr2,probably bit the edge of it
31-08-2018T03:14:20,Bgrmystr2,it is fairly thin there
31-08-2018T03:14:47,Bgrmystr2,"and I've bit my tounge a few times, and it bled as well. not a lot, but still"
31-08-2018T03:15:05,unsteddyphoenix,Huh.
31-08-2018T03:15:07,unsteddyphoenix,Unlucky
31-08-2018T03:15:11,Bgrmystr2,tounge is not made to withstand jaw muscle
31-08-2018T03:15:15,Bgrmystr2,xD
31-08-2018T03:15:33,Bgrmystr2,I learned this many a time
31-08-2018T03:16:48,Bgrmystr2,I'm guessing one of two things happened
31-08-2018T03:17:01,Bgrmystr2,tom did not die cuz he's immortal and that's like -1 hp in a pool of infinity
31-08-2018T03:17:05,Bgrmystr2,or
31-08-2018T03:17:22,Bgrmystr2,he did died but he respawned and just doesn't want us to know that he respawns.
31-08-2018T03:17:57,Bgrmystr2,it's one of the two.. gotta be.
31-08-2018T03:30:55,unsteddyphoenix,isnt infinite respawns also kinda immortality
31-08-2018T03:31:16,Bgrmystr2,um.. well if you respawn.. is it really you?
31-08-2018T03:31:49,Bgrmystr2,though to be fair.. our bodies replace all of our cells every what was it.. 7 years? 17? I don't remember
31-08-2018T03:31:54,Bgrmystr2,so I mean.. fuck

31-08-2018T15:11:47,Bgrmystr2,"sage, isn't there a tool in clip that's the same one tom uses to outline places to shade in photoshop?"
31-08-2018T15:12:21,SageSaga,yes

31-08-2018T15:16:22,SageSaga,you mean the blending option?

31-08-2018T15:17:48,Bgrmystr2,there's a transition
31-08-2018T15:17:58,Bgrmystr2,like a really soft transition from light to dark
31-08-2018T15:18:05,Bgrmystr2,rather than an abrupt color change
31-08-2018T15:19:10,SageSaga,like that Bgr?
31-08-2018T15:19:30,Bgrmystr2,"uhh, don't think it was like that. :thinking:"
31-08-2018T15:19:54,Bgrmystr2,"I wish I knew all the tools and what they did, it'd be so much easier lol"

31-08-2018T15:20:28,Bgrmystr2,that's the thing
31-08-2018T15:21:06,Bgrmystr2,like some kinda tool to make it all fuzzy
31-08-2018T15:21:16,SageSaga,Bgr - thats the aptly named blend tool
31-08-2018T15:21:24,Bgrmystr2,ooh okay
31-08-2018T15:21:43,CrimsonQuill,@SageSaga How does one star a comic on Genesis?

31-08-2018T15:23:16,SageSaga,Crimson - i dunno - its been over 14 years
31-08-2018T15:43:24,Rosscoe,Nyna Looks peeved

31-08-2018T15:56:38,SageSaga,fun times- now i can get back to work
31-08-2018T15:57:44,BadFoMo,What happened?
31-08-2018T15:58:36,FoxxTrotter,Must have been via whisper since I didn't see any posts by him on the chat.
31-08-2018T15:58:40,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering: Sage literally said what happen lol
31-08-2018T15:58:53,Bgrmystr2,"also, it doesn't say when sage removes messages unless it's all of them at once"
31-08-2018T15:58:55,SageSaga,yeah he whispered me to contact Tom for him for brush settings
31-08-2018T15:59:37,SageSaga,"so i gave him the settings- he decided i was lying- or rather ""Wanted to prove I was wrong- not call you a liar"""

31-08-2018T16:00:25,SageSaga,"that ""I was"" should be a ""you"""
31-08-2018T16:00:30,SageSaga,for clarity-
31-08-2018T16:00:51,SageSaga,and started sending me a bunch of youtube links while im working
31-08-2018T16:01:31,Rosscoe,Now thats just distruptive
31-08-2018T16:01:52,SageSaga,said i was one of those artist trying to hide skills and settings from others so I can remain better-
31-08-2018T16:02:06,Bgrmystr2,um? xD
31-08-2018T16:02:20,sunblaze,clearly a setting issue :P
31-08-2018T16:02:27,SageSaga,then said he would stream it to prove i was wrong-
31-08-2018T16:02:35,Bgrmystr2,"yeah a setting in his brain, sun :P"
31-08-2018T16:02:45,sunblaze,^no doubt :D
31-08-2018T16:02:48,SageSaga,"and by this point i was like ""You are a real jerk wasting my time after calling me a liar"""

31-08-2018T16:04:50,Rosscoe,That reminds me of those days where a pleasent chat in KB discord was going on and some one would come in and ruin it.
31-08-2018T16:05:05,Bgrmystr2,I..? I don't think he knows what he's talkin about.
31-08-2018T16:05:33,Bgrmystr2,"I mean.. all he asked was the settings tom used for his brushes, right? How would he know to say you are wrong to begin with?"
31-08-2018T16:05:44,Rosscoe,^
31-08-2018T16:05:47,SageSaga,"hey at least now im ""Big Pompous Artist"""

31-08-2018T16:06:16,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, take what you can get lol"
31-08-2018T16:07:34,SageSaga,but yeah- I stopped working and bothered Tom to get answers for him- he didnt like them and said -

31-08-2018T16:12:31,sunblaze,well at least 1 of three claims does that count?
31-08-2018T16:12:52,SageSaga,let me check with yall real quick on this though-
31-08-2018T16:13:22,SageSaga,if you say something - and someone tries to prove you are incorrect - and you insist- and they try harder- is that not them trying to call you a liar?
31-08-2018T16:14:28,sunblaze,it is yes. wither a liar or a morron becuase you did not check your facts
31-08-2018T16:14:32,sunblaze,both are insulting
31-08-2018T16:14:45,sunblaze,wither = either
31-08-2018T16:14:55,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: I mean.. I don't think so. I'd say there's a difference between intentionally lying vs being wrong and not knowing.
31-08-2018T16:15:02,Bgrmystr2,"but I feel his intention was calling you a liar, so"
31-08-2018T16:15:10,Bgrmystr2,either way
31-08-2018T16:15:19,SageSaga,think of the context though
31-08-2018T16:15:47,Bgrmystr2,yeah it seemed like roundabout underhanded to me

31-08-2018T16:18:22,SageSaga,man i hope this doesnt turn into a bunch of dragon furries annoying me now
31-08-2018T16:18:44,Rosscoe,Lol

31-08-2018T16:54:13,SageSaga,maaan and im supposed to go to Anthrocon next year
31-08-2018T16:55:09,Rosscoe,Sounds like your not now??
31-08-2018T16:55:42,SageSaga,just thinking about if i run into a bunch of Dragon Furries who hear some twisted version of events
31-08-2018T16:56:36,Rosscoe,I am sure two of them that constantly slander my name wont be there lol.
31-08-2018T16:57:08,SageSaga,"im hoping it goes like this - ""So! I hear you have a problem with us Dragon Furs"" ""Do you think its ok to insist I add your character to my comic so you can rape all my characters?"" ""Wh-What? No- heck no!"" ""Then we dont have an issue!"" *Manly Handshakes*"
31-08-2018T16:57:41,Rosscoe,I'll cross my fingers for yea
31-08-2018T16:58:46,Bgrmystr2,"dragons aren't furry anyway, so"
31-08-2018T16:58:49,Bgrmystr2,eh
31-08-2018T16:58:51,Bgrmystr2,lol
31-08-2018T16:58:54,SageSaga,"not so good case ""I hear you have problems with us Dragon furs and im incapable of rational thought!"" *Stab stab stab* ""Tom! Chalo! Someone! Make him stop! I need that blood!"""
31-08-2018T17:00:20,SageSaga,"make sure that when they make the headline they say ""Non Furry at Furry convention stabbed to death"""
31-08-2018T17:00:30,Twokinds,XD
31-08-2018T17:00:51,BadFoMo,Chalo?
31-08-2018T17:01:05,SageSaga,Chalo might be there-
31-08-2018T17:01:22,Bgrmystr2,xD Fomo.. sometimes I hope you never leave your rock
31-08-2018T17:01:26,SageSaga,i dont expect Ron to help- he'll probably just think we are old friends or something
31-08-2018T17:02:54,SageSaga,brb
31-08-2018T17:03:26,Rosscoe,Lol
31-08-2018T17:03:37,Rosscoe,Is Ron's memory getting worse?
31-08-2018T17:08:54,SageSaga,its not getting better
31-08-2018T17:14:00,SageSaga,actually- to be fair Ron's memory is just kinda weird- he can remember stuff very well when hes in the place it happened
31-08-2018T17:14:48,SageSaga,kinda like a location based memory.
31-08-2018T17:16:04,SageSaga,He would remember stuff when he returned to a convention very well but away from that place he couldnt remember much- so a lot of his memory is probably based on the scenery around him at the time
31-08-2018T17:16:10,Rosscoe,So he's become a walking burried memory box for each zone he visits
31-08-2018T17:18:30,Rosscoe,Interesting
31-08-2018T17:22:16,SageSaga,"so in a few years he can be like ""Oh... this is where Sage got stabbed to death"""

31-08-2018T17:35:24,Rosscoe,UNlike Asia where their clinet gets Anime tanks from to animes
31-08-2018T17:35:37,SageSaga,good- if you played on the US servers you would have to deal with my Nephew -

31-08-2018T17:36:19,Rosscoe,"When I first tired the game my buds where in UK and I thought the clinet had  server choice, it dont, you have to download the clinet to that server, I made it to teir 5 to fast on US servers, everyone were total whiners too"

31-08-2018T17:37:27,Rosscoe,EU Gamers are just as hard core as teh ASIA gamers.
31-08-2018T17:37:48,Bgrmystr2,yeh there's prolly a LOT more people on the US servers than the EU servers so of course you're going to find more players in the lower brackets
31-08-2018T17:38:00,Bgrmystr2,that doesn't mean the EU players are better tho lol
31-08-2018T17:38:02,SageSaga,US is a bunch of filthy casuals!
31-08-2018T17:38:14,Bgrmystr2,just a matter of the number of players
31-08-2018T17:38:38,SageSaga,and Russia is filled with cheaters
31-08-2018T17:39:03,SageSaga,and those mexicans! Are perfectly fine people

31-08-2018T17:41:02,sunblaze,"no thats only 1,5 like"
31-08-2018T17:41:09,sunblaze,the continent europe is

31-08-2018T17:41:19,SageSaga,yeah definitely
31-08-2018T17:41:50,Rosscoe,"Yea there has been a major shift, the EU insult in WoT was ""Filthy tomatoes!"" too ""SCRUB POLISH LORDS!"""

31-08-2018T17:42:16,SageSaga,but if you are going to compare continent to a country-
31-08-2018T17:42:20,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, but it's still much more likely that most of the people playing WoT is on the US server rather than the EU server."
31-08-2018T17:42:27,SageSaga,it would be more fair to do continent vs Continent -
31-08-2018T17:42:34,sunblaze,fair enough yes
31-08-2018T17:42:47,sunblaze,and servers =/ area anyway
31-08-2018T17:42:48,SageSaga,so North America vs Europe  - Europe has more but not double

31-08-2018T22:57:00,Dadrobit,Screw Patreon. For real.
31-08-2018T22:57:28,Dadrobit,Second time in a month they've locked my desktop out of my account for literally no reason.
31-08-2018T23:00:27,Dadrobit,"Trying to get into the suggestion box from my email, and it locks me out saying that I need to verify through my email."
31-08-2018T23:04:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’m just trying to figure out which suggestion to throw in. Do I try another card, or go with one of the others I’ve cooked up"
31-08-2018T23:05:12,unsteddyphoenix,Im just trying to figure out how lewd my request should be :thinking:
31-08-2018T23:05:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve yet to think of a lewd request
31-08-2018T23:05:54,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s been mostly cute or off the wall things
31-08-2018T23:06:34,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe this is the time~
31-08-2018T23:07:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d suggest something like “Kat makes a teddy; shows an oblivious Eric”
31-08-2018T23:07:38,Dadrobit,:( Now I'm even locked out on my phone.
31-08-2018T23:07:46,SpazztasticKiwi,But I’m not sure Tom knows what a teddy is
31-08-2018T23:07:50,Dadrobit,And the verification link isn't working at all.
31-08-2018T23:08:04,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao oh noo~
31-08-2018T23:08:19,unsteddyphoenix,Want me to link you the form? That should be ok right
31-08-2018T23:08:22,Dadrobit,"Just got the ""Patreon Reciept"" notification though, so nice to know that at least they've taken my money."
31-08-2018T23:08:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Could you delete and then redownload the app?
31-08-2018T23:08:40,Dadrobit,Not doing it through the app
31-08-2018T23:08:57,SpazztasticKiwi,“Sucks you can’t see what you’ve paid for but we’ll take that $$$”
31-08-2018T23:09:39,Dadrobit,"I'm actually kind of tilted, this literally is exactly what happened last time and I couldn't get my suggestion in because of it."
31-08-2018T23:10:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m also not sure if a teddy can be make to where it’s reasonably appropriate. It’ll still get 18+ restricted on Patreon I bet but still
31-08-2018T23:10:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Then again “teddy” and “reasonably appropriate” don’t belong in the same sentence
31-08-2018T23:10:53,unsteddyphoenix,Wait.
31-08-2018T23:10:58,unsteddyphoenix,Youre not talking about a teddy bear
31-08-2018T23:11:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Uh no
31-08-2018T23:11:27,unsteddyphoenix,google save me
31-08-2018T23:11:28,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s why I mentioned Kat in it showing an oblivious Eric
31-08-2018T23:11:37,SpazztasticKiwi,SAFE SEARCH ON
31-08-2018T23:11:46,Dadrobit,I see Teddy used in a less than innocent manner and my mind goes to the Teddiz from Conker's Bad Fur Day.
31-08-2018T23:11:48,SpazztasticKiwi,MAKE SURE SAFE SEARCH IS ON
31-08-2018T23:12:27,unsteddyphoenix,The day I turn safe search on is the day I admit DEFEAT
31-08-2018T23:12:47,unsteddyphoenix,So it's just...really odd lingere?
31-08-2018T23:12:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’d say put Flora in one, but it makes more sense for Kat to make one for herself since Flora can’t make one herself or really buy one"
31-08-2018T23:13:08,SpazztasticKiwi,And it doesn’t really seem to take much for Flora to tempt Trace
31-08-2018T23:13:31,unsteddyphoenix,Why not? Theyre not married YET
31-08-2018T23:13:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Usually a teddy comes with a robe too so
31-08-2018T23:13:49,unsteddyphoenix,Their sexlife could still be alive!
31-08-2018T23:13:58,Dadrobit,Reni is the obvious choice tbh
31-08-2018T23:14:09,unsteddyphoenix,Ooo
31-08-2018T23:14:15,SpazztasticKiwi,“Am I wearing it underneath or not? Will you find out? We’ll see”
31-08-2018T23:14:25,Bgrmystr2,"Kiwi, you tell us about safe search like we're not adults and keep it on or something.."
31-08-2018T23:14:29,unsteddyphoenix,Reni is a high quality pick
31-08-2018T23:14:31,Bgrmystr2,what do you take us for? lol
31-08-2018T23:15:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"No it’s just if you share the computer with someone else, the other person may bring up questions"
31-08-2018T23:15:16,unsteddyphoenix,but not as high as :ctwokinds-wink:
31-08-2018T23:15:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"And while it’s obvious I’m sure y’all have seen nudity before, there’s other things that can pop up that shouldn’t exist but do"
31-08-2018T23:16:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also if I suggest the Kat in teddy with Eric thing, I don’t feel like it’d be fun to explain why there’s no bear in the picture"
31-08-2018T23:16:57,Bgrmystr2,that's their problem that they're spying into your browser history.
31-08-2018T23:16:59,Bgrmystr2,Honestly
31-08-2018T23:17:05,Bgrmystr2,it's none of their damn business
31-08-2018T23:17:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Not that I feel many would complain about seeing boobs instead
31-08-2018T23:18:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Although...
31-08-2018T23:18:33,SpazztasticKiwi,What if Kat made Nat a teddy for Keith?
31-08-2018T23:19:05,Bgrmystr2,for.. keith?
31-08-2018T23:19:08,Bgrmystr2,why though
31-08-2018T23:19:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Nat wears the teddy and shows Keith
31-08-2018T23:20:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Didn’t mix up a character did i
31-08-2018T23:20:41,unsteddyphoenix,Natani IS thinking about it~
31-08-2018T23:21:21,SpazztasticKiwi,“I didn’t sleep with him yet. Kat hasn’t finished the special pajamas”
31-08-2018T23:22:19,Bgrmystr2,well I mean.. kat would just give it to natani then
31-08-2018T23:22:21,Bgrmystr2,instead of keith
31-08-2018T23:22:48,SpazztasticKiwi,First sentence says that
31-08-2018T23:24:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Though this is just for the subject that I e never given a lewd suggestion
31-08-2018T23:24:31,Dadrobit,email sent. Place your bets on whether or not they actually fix the issue before I get fucked over in the suggestions again.
31-08-2018T23:24:59,SpazztasticKiwi,So this would be a lewd suggestion. My other lewdness would be for female-audience fan service and I’m not sure how popular that’d be
31-08-2018T23:25:15,Bgrmystr2,oh it sounded like you were saying for kat to make one for natani and to give it to keith to give to natani and I'm just like.. why the middleman?
31-08-2018T23:25:57,Bgrmystr2,but yeah actually males are fairly popular
31-08-2018T23:25:58,Bgrmystr2,surprisingly
31-08-2018T23:26:08,SpazztasticKiwi,And honestly none of the guys are really...fan service-y
31-08-2018T23:26:10,Bgrmystr2,"females much more so, but males still get voted sometimes"
31-08-2018T23:26:29,Bgrmystr2,"a few are, they just aren't main character classification"
31-08-2018T23:26:39,Bgrmystr2,more supporting characters
31-08-2018T23:26:49,unsteddyphoenix,UMMM
31-08-2018T23:26:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Zen and Keith are liked but other than that it’s a few side characters and just alot of beef show
31-08-2018T23:26:56,unsteddyphoenix,https://www.deviantart.com/twokinds/art/Sexy-Sexy-Alaric-93400735
31-08-2018T23:27:00,unsteddyphoenix,I bet you feel SILLY now
31-08-2018T23:27:27,Bgrmystr2,"and thanks for proving my point, cuz Alaric is a supporting character, not a main character. And he's one of the ones I was thinking of. :)"
31-08-2018T23:27:31,Bgrmystr2,"so cheers, phoenix."
31-08-2018T23:27:33,Bgrmystr2,Right on cue.
31-08-2018T23:27:41,unsteddyphoenix,He's the main character
31-08-2018T23:27:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"Even now, I don’t know what’s seen in him"
31-08-2018T23:27:50,Bgrmystr2,"only of your lofe story, bro"
31-08-2018T23:27:54,unsteddyphoenix,Bah. Plebians.
31-08-2018T23:27:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Besides abs
31-08-2018T23:28:05,Bgrmystr2,"love* story, though I could say life story and it'd be equally as accurate"
31-08-2018T23:28:50,Bgrmystr2,"and kiwi, you might just be blind, cuz even I can see why ppl would like him lol"
31-08-2018T23:29:00,Bgrmystr2,and I'm not even remotely attracted to guys
31-08-2018T23:29:08,Bgrmystr2,not even a little
31-08-2018T23:29:20,unsteddyphoenix,same
31-08-2018T23:29:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d say Eric’s attractive if he wasn’t a perv and Red would be if he wasn’t an ass sometimes
31-08-2018T23:29:31,Bgrmystr2,"I can also see why kids love cinnamon toast crunch, but yknow."
31-08-2018T23:29:39,Bgrmystr2,that's besides the point
31-08-2018T23:29:56,Bgrmystr2,cuz someone was gonna think it
31-08-2018T23:30:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"Alaric’s ok, but just not someone I’d consider on my radar"
31-08-2018T23:30:38,Dadrobit,How?
31-08-2018T23:31:04,Dadrobit,"I mean, besides that whole ""dead"" thing."
31-08-2018T23:31:05,unsteddyphoenix,Just doesnt make sense :T
31-08-2018T23:31:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Well the dead thing sure has a lot to do with it
31-08-2018T23:31:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"A pulse is required to get things up, you know"
31-08-2018T23:32:07,unsteddyphoenix,Uncalled for :(
31-08-2018T23:32:15,unsteddyphoenix,Also if that's the case then explain twilight
31-08-2018T23:32:25,Dadrobit,"To be fair, not being able to get up is what killed him."
31-08-2018T23:32:33,Bgrmystr2,"you're probably not into that whole aspect lol. He relies a lot on the whole prettyboy aspect, being suave and daring, he's also got an air of class while having muscles and not being a meadhead baffoon"
31-08-2018T23:32:44,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s alot of issues in twilight
31-08-2018T23:33:15,Bgrmystr2,"Alaric has a LOT going for him, you just don't care for that kind of person. Tis why it doesn't affect you"
31-08-2018T23:33:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"Like, supposed to be skin tough as stone, but no blood and also glitters in sun"
31-08-2018T23:33:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Like ????
31-08-2018T23:34:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Prettyboy aspect and suave reminds me too much of high school prep types
31-08-2018T23:34:52,Dadrobit,Twilight was actually the first movie I flat out stopped watching it was so bad.
31-08-2018T23:34:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"So no, not something I’ll look at twice"
31-08-2018T23:35:15,Dadrobit,"Like, I have super low standards for movies, but holy shit."
31-08-2018T23:35:17,Bgrmystr2,"yeah kiwi they fall under that classification too, though slightly different"
31-08-2018T23:35:40,Bgrmystr2,"I'm not even gonna bother with that movie, myself"
31-08-2018T23:35:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Only think that pissed me off about the movies were the major inconsistencies
31-08-2018T23:35:54,SpazztasticKiwi,And that damn fight scene
31-08-2018T23:36:15,SpazztasticKiwi,In Breaking Dawn
31-08-2018T23:37:07,Dadrobit,"In a movie full of vampires, it was surprising to find that the person who was the most dead inside was the main protagonist."
31-08-2018T23:37:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"They made Jasper look constipated, Alice cake off as ditzy, and Emmet didn’t get near the scenes as he did in the books"
31-08-2018T23:37:55,SpazztasticKiwi,*came off
31-08-2018T23:38:02,SpazztasticKiwi,*Emmett
31-08-2018T23:38:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Emmett was my favorite. Forgot Edward and Jacob
31-08-2018T23:39:02,SpazztasticKiwi,*forget
31-08-2018T23:46:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll just try Nat in a teddy for Keith. Maybe it’ll be well received
31-08-2018T23:52:50,BadFoMo,A Teddy?
31-08-2018T23:57:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Lingerie
