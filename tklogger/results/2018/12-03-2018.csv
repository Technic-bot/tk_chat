12-03-2018T00:00:20,Vatruvius,"I don't know, I like mornings...sometimes. It is the really early ones that I do not like. Get up at 6:30-7:00, go to school, those are not fun."
12-03-2018T00:00:36,Bgrmystr2,then you're not one of them
12-03-2018T00:00:55,Bgrmystr2,THEY are the kind of ppl that wake up bright-eyed and bushy tailed super early in the morning every single day
12-03-2018T00:01:35,unsteddyphoenix,How I hate them...
12-03-2018T00:01:36,Dadrobit,That's why I scheduled all of my classes for after noon
12-03-2018T00:01:36,Bgrmystr2,they have no concept of why people hate morning
12-03-2018T00:01:40,Bgrmystr2,"same, phoenix"
12-03-2018T00:03:10,unsteddyphoenix,Theyre the type of people to make weird pizzas
12-03-2018T00:03:25,Dadrobit,Kale pizza
12-03-2018T00:06:04,Vatruvius,"Now wait just a minute, depending on my schedule I love mornings and wake bright-eyed. In particular, Friday and Monday are great for me as I have no classes but I can still get up and be productive. I just do not like mornings before 8:00"
12-03-2018T00:06:42,Bgrmystr2,you're still not one of them though xD
12-03-2018T00:06:49,Bgrmystr2,cuz they love mornings no matter what
12-03-2018T00:06:58,Bgrmystr2,you may have traits of them
12-03-2018T00:07:06,Bgrmystr2,but it's not the same as being one
12-03-2018T00:07:15,Bgrmystr2,"not that it's a bad thing, just"
12-03-2018T00:07:17,Bgrmystr2,it just is.
12-03-2018T00:07:24,Bgrmystr2,it is as it does.
12-03-2018T00:09:04,unsteddyphoenix,thats how it be and do
12-03-2018T00:09:14,Bgrmystr2,^
12-03-2018T00:14:34,Barabashe4ka,Hello everybody
12-03-2018T00:14:38,Dadrobit,o/
12-03-2018T00:20:31,Bgrmystr2,@Vatruvius if you need to know what a morning person is.. https://youtu.be/yP8Cag86ZfA?t=30 Timestamped for your convenience.
12-03-2018T00:20:45,Bgrmystr2,Beware anyone who is not a morning person.
12-03-2018T00:28:43,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:
12-03-2018T00:29:12,Vatruvius,Okay...@Bgrmystr2...I have never come across anyone like that in my life. Is that even physically possible?
12-03-2018T00:29:31,Bgrmystr2,XD
12-03-2018T00:29:37,Bgrmystr2,THOSE PEOPLE
12-03-2018T00:29:40,Bgrmystr2,They are morning people.
12-03-2018T00:29:55,Bgrmystr2,"and they are terrible. They love mornings, and normally have boundless energy"
12-03-2018T00:30:02,Bgrmystr2,"and tend to be rare, but impossible to miss"
12-03-2018T00:30:06,Bgrmystr2,I've met like.. 2 or 3
12-03-2018T00:34:25,Dadrobit,Holy shit he's drinking wine
12-03-2018T00:34:32,Dadrobit,fucking whisper
12-03-2018T00:35:05,Vatruvius,"Yeah...about that...I live in a small town. You would be hard pressed to find a building with more then a 2nd floor. There really is not a lot of people here, a large enough sample size, for me to meet a ""true"" morning person."
12-03-2018T00:35:33,Vatruvius,What @Dadrobit?
12-03-2018T00:36:03,Dadrobit,Screwed up a whisper
12-03-2018T00:36:15,Vatruvius,I see.
12-03-2018T00:37:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I know a morning person. Annoying little shites
12-03-2018T00:37:33,Vatruvius,Who Kiwi?
12-03-2018T00:37:52,SpazztasticKiwi,My church‚Äôs youth pastor
12-03-2018T00:38:43,SpazztasticKiwi,He‚Äôs not a bad guy. I just imagine him with a wagging tail sometimes
12-03-2018T00:39:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don‚Äôt mind you being cheerful and happy to be up at the crack of dawn, but don‚Äôt be all over me about it. I‚Äôm still trying to wake up"
12-03-2018T00:39:45,Vatruvius,That would actually probably help with interacting with him.
12-03-2018T00:40:20,Vatruvius,I see your point. I would not want to be waked up with someone bouncing on my bed wanting to do stuff.
12-03-2018T00:40:42,Vatruvius,****...that is going to be my kids on Christmas...
12-03-2018T00:40:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"Hakunna your ta-tas, man"
12-03-2018T00:41:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Let me have my coffee
12-03-2018T00:42:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Then you can do your impression of an excited golden retriever on a freshly waxed hardwood floor
12-03-2018T00:42:16,Vatruvius,"I am quite happy that I am not a coffee person. I do not need anything to wake me up, once I am up I just am."
12-03-2018T00:42:41,Vatruvius,What?
12-03-2018T00:42:58,unsteddyphoenix,Hakuna your tatas lol
12-03-2018T00:43:02,unsteddyphoenix,Im stealin that
12-03-2018T00:43:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I say it all the time at work
12-03-2018T00:43:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Along with other phrases
12-03-2018T00:44:14,Vatruvius,"Like, the only thing that sounds close to is from The Lion King"
12-03-2018T00:44:33,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs where it came from
12-03-2018T00:44:34,Vatruvius,Or am I missing something here?
12-03-2018T00:44:41,Vatruvius,Okay...I know something then.
12-03-2018T00:45:14,Dadrobit,"Okay, I think I'm gonna watch a movie and head to bed. Have a good one y'all."
12-03-2018T00:45:45,Vatruvius,Goognight @Dadrobit
12-03-2018T00:46:39,Bgrmystr2,Gnight Dadro
12-03-2018T00:48:48,unsteddyphoenix,seeya daddy
12-03-2018T00:52:13,SpazztasticKiwi,‚úåüèª
12-03-2018T00:58:03,TheBeckoner,I am happy. PC is finally running how it should have 3 years ago...
12-03-2018T00:58:49,unsteddyphoenix,THEN YOU BETTER
12-03-2018T00:58:50,unsteddyphoenix,GO
12-03-2018T00:58:51,unsteddyphoenix,CATCH IT
12-03-2018T00:59:32,TheBeckoner,welp
12-03-2018T01:00:41,TheBeckoner,"If i catch it, it can't run..."
12-03-2018T01:01:58,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
12-03-2018T01:03:17,TheBeckoner,Got the i7 to 4.2ghz from 3.5ghz and got the ram from 1.3ghz to 2.4ghz. I am gruntled.
12-03-2018T01:08:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Guess who just scratched open their burn blister
12-03-2018T01:08:50,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-scratch: n-not me
12-03-2018T01:09:11,TheBeckoner,also not me
12-03-2018T01:09:22,TheBeckoner,dont have one to start with...
12-03-2018T01:09:53,unsteddyphoenix,That was silly
12-03-2018T01:10:00,unsteddyphoenix,SHouldve stabbed it with a pencil instead
12-03-2018T01:10:08,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock:
12-03-2018T01:10:21,Bgrmystr2,you don't stab an open wound with a pencil
12-03-2018T01:10:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve already stabbed myself with a pensil
12-03-2018T01:10:24,Bgrmystr2,or even a closed one
12-03-2018T01:10:30,Bgrmystr2,hahaha
12-03-2018T01:10:41,Bgrmystr2,no need to do it again
12-03-2018T01:10:44,Bgrmystr2,stab already complete
12-03-2018T01:11:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôve also broken a bone, so no need to repeat that either"
12-03-2018T01:11:16,Vatruvius,Hmm...I would not recommend the stabbing of anything with a pencil but that blister should have been opened up to dry and allow it to heal better.
12-03-2018T01:12:26,SpazztasticKiwi,It is 3 inches long. You‚Äôre crazy
12-03-2018T01:12:36,TheBeckoner,woa thats big...
12-03-2018T01:13:03,Vatruvius,"I had a 2 inch one, had 2nd degree burns all down my upper back."
12-03-2018T01:13:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Oops. Wrong side of the ruler - 2 inches
12-03-2018T01:13:44,TheBeckoner,oh
12-03-2018T01:13:47,TheBeckoner,still...
12-03-2018T01:13:50,TheBeckoner,what is it from?
12-03-2018T01:13:55,SpazztasticKiwi,If you measure end to end
12-03-2018T01:14:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Fryer basket
12-03-2018T01:14:32,Vatruvius,For me...a nasty sunburn when out with my troop.
12-03-2018T01:15:07,TheBeckoner,biggest and worst burn I got was from welding. quickest way to sunburn/tan
12-03-2018T01:15:19,SpazztasticKiwi,The blistering part is on the end that the basket touched me completely - the rest is just scalded
12-03-2018T01:16:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I need to wash it off and wrap it with some ointment but that‚Äôs gonna sting and may open it further
12-03-2018T01:17:18,Vatruvius,"I actually have a scare that is three inches long and an inch and a half wide from a burn when I was little. All scar tissue, not a single nerve in it."
12-03-2018T01:17:46,Vatruvius,It is actually quiet weird to touch yourslef and only have one set of nerves tell you you are touching yourself.
12-03-2018T01:17:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I got a little burn mark on my knee from when I tripped over an easy bake oven
12-03-2018T01:18:12,TheBeckoner,I have a burn mark from a ramen noodle on my lip lol
12-03-2018T01:18:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Sugar can help heal mouth burns
12-03-2018T01:18:49,Vatruvius,Small fry...ahahaha...good pun...no? ****it!
12-03-2018T01:19:02,Vatruvius,Sugar heals all wounds.
12-03-2018T01:19:07,Vatruvius,In the form of ice cream.
12-03-2018T01:19:50,TheBeckoner,especially emotional.
12-03-2018T01:20:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Tell that to my cracked growth plate
12-03-2018T01:20:27,Vatruvius,Your what?
12-03-2018T01:21:24,SpazztasticKiwi,The growth plate in my right elbow was almost broken off when I broke my arm about 9 years ago
12-03-2018T01:21:52,Vatruvius,Could the doctors not set up back correctly?
12-03-2018T01:22:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"It didn‚Äôt break completely - it just cracked down the middle, almost all the way through, but not quite"
12-03-2018T01:23:21,Vatruvius,I just googled it and...you are in a lot of pain when you don't use your arm a certain way right?
12-03-2018T01:23:22,SpazztasticKiwi,It healed completely but I can‚Äôt bend my arm all the way up like I can my left and it‚Äôs weaker
12-03-2018T01:24:39,SpazztasticKiwi,But it‚Äôs not anything obvious
12-03-2018T01:25:30,Vatruvius,"I had hurt my wrist really bad about five years ago. My family and I were moving and I tripped and landed completely on my left wrist. Ever now and then it hurts, but if I life something really heavy I injure it really easy and cannot lift anything."
12-03-2018T01:26:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that bad, but I try to leave the heavier stuff to my left arm and hold most of the weight of anything I carry on that side too"
12-03-2018T01:28:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Weight lifting may be a good idea to regain some of the strength I lost
12-03-2018T01:28:53,Vatruvius,"Now that I think about it, my wrist has not acted up lately so hopeful just a few more years and it will be like it never happened. Has your fracture never healed?"
12-03-2018T01:29:54,TheBeckoner,weight lifting is fun.
12-03-2018T01:30:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"It‚Äôs shown to be healed, but I also don‚Äôt know if that elbow has a new stress limit"
12-03-2018T01:31:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"It has a bit of a mobility restriction now and strength decrease, so what if I end up rebreaking it"
12-03-2018T01:31:36,Vatruvius,"Well, it will be healed but it is weaker then before the injury. I am not sure about bone though I would assume it is similar. If you injure a muscle, not like lifting but like tearing, it takes years before it is fully healed."
12-03-2018T01:32:51,Vatruvius,I tore the left side of my lower back working at UPS and like my wrist it is easily re-injured. It just takes time I think. I would assume in from your case the bone either takes significantly longer or if you break it it will forever be weaker there.
12-03-2018T01:33:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I also chipped a bone in my right ankle. The doctors said the chip was fusing to the back of my foot bone
12-03-2018T01:34:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I think all I could do is try to regain the muscle strength I lost while the arm was healing
12-03-2018T01:34:32,Vatruvius,Boy...you really injure yourself. Did you do a lot of risky things or is it just a lot of bad luck?
12-03-2018T01:34:48,SpazztasticKiwi,My ankles are double jointed
12-03-2018T01:35:06,Vatruvius,"Ohh yeah, physical therapy is very important after an injury."
12-03-2018T01:35:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"They twist easily, and that day, the ankle twisted and I landed - full body weight - on that ankle"
12-03-2018T01:35:34,TheBeckoner,hmm Ive never broken anything.
12-03-2018T01:36:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm lucky the ankle didn‚Äôt break completely. It just sprained really bad and chipped a bone
12-03-2018T01:36:20,Vatruvius,With you on that one @TheBeckoner. I only have injuries and scares but no broken bones.
12-03-2018T01:37:37,TheBeckoner,same. Somewhat resilient I suppose.
12-03-2018T01:38:55,Vatruvius,My dead was not resilient but my mom is so I get it from her.
12-03-2018T01:38:59,Vatruvius,dad*
12-03-2018T01:39:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I got my double jointed ankles from my dad...even though they‚Äôre most common in wome
12-03-2018T01:44:23,unsteddyphoenix,Just stay inside where its safe
12-03-2018T01:45:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I do preferably
12-03-2018T01:59:09,Vatruvius,We are all here aren't we?
12-03-2018T02:03:35,Vatruvius,That was not the worst remake I have ever watched.
12-03-2018T02:12:07,TheBeckoner,WOT
12-03-2018T02:12:10,TheBeckoner,oops
12-03-2018T02:12:12,TheBeckoner,lol
12-03-2018T02:12:14,TheBeckoner,wot*
12-03-2018T02:13:50,Vatruvius,"The Power Rangers remake that they did. It just came out on Amazon Prime. Since the Power Rangers were my thing growing up, even remember dressing up as the Red Ranger, it was not all the bad compared to the ones I grew up with."
12-03-2018T02:34:10,Vatruvius,"Well, I assume everyone went to bed. But...just on a side note before I head off...Eric is an imbecile for leaving Kat in the family zone. Obviously I am rereading the comic and I am sure you can guess where I am right now...ek...Eric...I am watching you."
12-03-2018T02:40:18,Bgrmystr2,I never went anywhere
12-03-2018T02:40:21,Bgrmystr2,been playing games
12-03-2018T02:40:24,Bgrmystr2,"well, one game"
12-03-2018T02:40:26,Bgrmystr2,but still
12-03-2018T02:41:00,TheBeckoner,been playin fortnite.
12-03-2018T02:41:13,Bgrmystr2,Path of Exile myself
12-03-2018T02:41:52,TheBeckoner,Never played that.
12-03-2018T02:42:17,TheBeckoner,is it an rpg?
12-03-2018T02:42:21,TheBeckoner,I cant remember...
12-03-2018T02:42:38,Bgrmystr2,it's a slanted top down kinda like the diablo series
12-03-2018T02:42:58,TheBeckoner,Ah ok.
12-03-2018T02:43:20,Bgrmystr2,"when Diablo 2 ended and blizzard cut the current progress of D3, a lot of the team split and made two games similar to it"
12-03-2018T02:43:25,Bgrmystr2,Path of Exile and Torchlight 2
12-03-2018T02:43:32,Bgrmystr2,both of which are pretty good imo
12-03-2018T02:43:41,Bgrmystr2,then they got a huge new team to make D3
12-03-2018T02:43:45,Bgrmystr2,from bliz
12-03-2018T02:43:49,Bgrmystr2,and it was eh
12-03-2018T02:44:53,TheBeckoner,Oh I've heard about torchlight. Almost bought it. (or maybe it was ftp?)
12-03-2018T02:46:53,Bgrmystr2,Torchlight 2 you bought
12-03-2018T02:46:59,Bgrmystr2,Path of Exile is Free
12-03-2018T02:47:03,Vatruvius,"I have returned...but only for a moment. I remembered what that sketch, the one where Natani held the dead Keith for real, reminded me of. It was the opening section of Last of Us."
12-03-2018T02:47:41,TheBeckoner,dang that was a while ago. I would have forgot to remember lol.
12-03-2018T02:51:29,Vatruvius,"If you ever need to get someone to cry, you make them watch or play that opening section of Last of Us. Guaranteed to hit the feels. I just wish Last of Us was on PC."
12-03-2018T02:52:31,Vatruvius,"I just feel for a game like Last of Us, with so much effort put into it, that it should be available for everyone to experience."
12-03-2018T07:25:15,Barabashe4ka,Hello everybody
12-03-2018T11:41:08,ComicLuke,"hey, whats up people?"

12-03-2018T13:43:32,qwe304,and where would preorders be held/announced?
12-03-2018T13:49:35,Twokinds,on the website
12-03-2018T13:58:47,qwe304,ill have to keep my eye on it then
12-03-2018T16:49:49,GameForge,when was this convo goin?
12-03-2018T16:56:20,Bgrmystr2,Turn on timestamps in the chat
12-03-2018T16:56:27,Bgrmystr2,and you can see
12-03-2018T16:56:49,Bgrmystr2,couple hrs ago it ended
12-03-2018T17:05:45,GameForge,right right
12-03-2018T17:15:05,SpazztasticKiwi,AnyoneÔøΩs pets just suddenly get suspiciously affectionate? Like ÔøΩrefuses to leave you aloneÔøΩ loving?
12-03-2018T17:22:24,SpazztasticKiwi,ItÔøΩs not bad. Just confusing
12-03-2018T18:29:47,Bgrmystr2,Animals have instincts that tell them if someone close to them is feeling bad or stressed
12-03-2018T18:29:56,Bgrmystr2,and they'll naturally try to make you feel better
12-03-2018T18:30:12,Bgrmystr2,they also have instincts that tell them of danger too
12-03-2018T18:30:37,Bgrmystr2,so sometimes you see older pets doing that
12-03-2018T18:31:01,Bgrmystr2,spent more time w/ those they like before they pass on
12-03-2018T18:31:02,Bgrmystr2,etc
12-03-2018T18:31:23,Bgrmystr2,could be the person too
12-03-2018T18:31:38,Bgrmystr2,but yeah there's a bunch of stuff like that
12-03-2018T19:07:51,unsteddyphoenix,Careful though they may want your kidneys
12-03-2018T19:36:06,SpazztasticKiwi,He just wanted attention
12-03-2018T20:10:30,SpazztasticKiwi,WhatÔøΩd everyone else do today
12-03-2018T20:19:06,Vatruvius,I got drenched if you had not already read.
12-03-2018T20:27:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah I did see that. 50 minute walk to class? Are there no campus buses or buses at all around?

12-03-2018T20:32:41,Vatruvius,"50 minute drive, 10 minute walk from where I park to where my class is."
