17-09-2018T00:10:29,MysticalDragons28593,lol me too
17-09-2018T00:11:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m watching comedy shows
17-09-2018T00:29:16,Vatruvius,Hey everyone! :ptv-greetings:
17-09-2018T00:30:02,Vatruvius,"And what's this, both unsteady and Ord are mods!?"
17-09-2018T00:30:06,Vatruvius,Ooo!
17-09-2018T00:39:00,TheBeckoner,There was an incident last night that required backup
17-09-2018T00:39:28,Bgrmystr2,yeah incident is right
17-09-2018T00:56:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve still yet to hear entirely what happened but it was someone stupid I’m sure
17-09-2018T00:57:48,Vatruvius,"Oh god, another shit head?"
17-09-2018T00:57:57,Vatruvius,Or multiple?
17-09-2018T00:59:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Dunno. But apparently it warranted deputization
17-09-2018T00:59:53,Vatruvius,Hmm...
17-09-2018T01:00:09,Vatruvius,"Well, that is a shame."
17-09-2018T01:00:15,SpazztasticKiwi,When I did return I may have caught the tail end before one left but I’m not sure
17-09-2018T01:00:39,Vatruvius,The fact that we needed deputization.
17-09-2018T01:01:45,SpazztasticKiwi,The one I saw was “random annoying comments that made no sense”
17-09-2018T01:02:00,Vatruvius,*sigh*
17-09-2018T01:02:03,SpazztasticKiwi,A word vomit troll essentially
17-09-2018T01:02:25,Vatruvius,"Why though, why ruin a nice chat? I fail to see how anyone finds such a thing amusing."
17-09-2018T01:02:51,Vatruvius,I suppose it is the only chance they have at getting an erection.
17-09-2018T01:03:30,Bgrmystr2,"oh, it was the generic anti-furry troll spammer"
17-09-2018T01:03:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to know where the copy/paste troll thing of “you degenerate furry - you’ll never get puss a day in your life and the only one you’ll ever get to experience was your mom’s when you were born...”
17-09-2018T01:03:45,Vatruvius,I see...
17-09-2018T01:03:47,Bgrmystr2,the one that harasses everyone and spams streams with super old copypastes
17-09-2018T01:04:21,SpazztasticKiwi,“You’re in You’re mom’s basement...yadayadayada”
17-09-2018T01:04:41,Bgrmystr2,it probably stems from years and years ago. potentially even on 4chan
17-09-2018T01:04:44,Vatruvius,I think that statement says more about the personal/sexual life of the type-y rather than the reader.
17-09-2018T01:04:44,Bgrmystr2,I dunno
17-09-2018T01:05:02,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, if it was the same guy, and it probably is"
17-09-2018T01:05:05,Bgrmystr2,then he has no life
17-09-2018T01:05:12,Bgrmystr2,basically
17-09-2018T01:05:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"Like bruh, you think a girl gonna care that you spout that message all day on the internet"
17-09-2018T01:05:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"If she do, please don’t breed"
17-09-2018T01:06:19,Vatruvius,"Please, you will only birth more shitheads into this world."
17-09-2018T01:07:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"My favorite thing is when they make fun of “internet personalities” for never getting any and it’s just like “bitch please, they could make your girlfriend scream just by pressing the like button”"
17-09-2018T01:08:40,Bgrmystr2,implying the dude could ever get a girlfriend to begin with haha
17-09-2018T01:08:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Tru. Tru
17-09-2018T01:10:34,Vatruvius,"Well, hopefully such things can be prevented in the future now that we have a larger force."
17-09-2018T01:10:49,Vatruvius,Not prevented...but more quickly dispatched with.
17-09-2018T01:11:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"I know alot of troll like to use the “only fans are 12 year old girls” card and I stand there, fully adult woman like “this bitch stupid”"
17-09-2018T01:14:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I’ve also experienced some of the worst examples of racism being a fan of a few certain people
17-09-2018T01:14:43,SpazztasticKiwi,But stupidity is incurable. Especially since we keep letting it breed
17-09-2018T01:19:23,Vatruvius,"If any of you have watching the Mighty Jingles and his Jurassic World Evolution videos, then you will know that a Jingles' Jurassic Park would solve these problems. XD"
17-09-2018T01:19:31,Vatruvius,watched*
17-09-2018T01:25:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Just remove the common sense warning labels on stuff
17-09-2018T01:25:27,SpazztasticKiwi,That should weed plenty out
17-09-2018T01:26:29,Vatruvius,Yup!
17-09-2018T01:26:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"“Do not place any body part in cardboard baler while in operation” someone does, I think we can afford to lose em"
17-09-2018T01:27:06,Vatruvius,"Like the ""do not put bag over head"" warning. Just remove that and about 50% of stupids will go."
17-09-2018T01:28:20,Vatruvius,"My personal favorite that particularly applies to Jingles' Jurassic Park, remove all ""do night climb enclosure fence"" warnings."
17-09-2018T01:29:13,Vatruvius,"As he put it, ""please, send your kids to Jingles' Jurassic Park, we guarantee you will get the smart ones back."""
17-09-2018T01:29:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I do wonder why there’s no “do not use baby oil as lubricant” on condoms though. That’s not as common sense cause it’s more chemical based
17-09-2018T01:30:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"Baby oil breaks down latex. It’s slightly alarming, the amount of people who don’t know"
17-09-2018T01:31:13,Vatruvius,"Hmm, baby oil is pretty much scented mineral oil."
17-09-2018T01:31:33,Vatruvius,That is an interesting fact I did not know.
17-09-2018T01:31:54,Vatruvius,"Though the only application of baby oil in my house is to clean stainless steal, not for sexual means."
17-09-2018T01:32:46,Vatruvius,Why individuals felt the need to use a lubricant at all...well...I suppose they like other means of sex.
17-09-2018T01:32:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"And if she’s been to the salon or cleaned up, make sure baby oil wasn’t her moisturizer of choice too"
17-09-2018T01:33:10,Vatruvius,I think the real problem are individuals that double up their condoms.
17-09-2018T01:33:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Or if you leave them in your wallet for longer than a month. They start breaking down
17-09-2018T01:33:54,Vatruvius,That too.
17-09-2018T01:33:59,Vatruvius,"Depending on the condom, but yeah."
17-09-2018T01:35:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I also read once where this girl used bleach floor cleaner on something she shouldn’t have
17-09-2018T01:36:24,Vatruvius,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:
17-09-2018T01:36:42,Twokinds,Color clothes?
17-09-2018T01:36:50,Vatruvius,I don't think so Tom.
17-09-2018T01:36:54,SpazztasticKiwi,She made choramine gas
17-09-2018T01:37:02,Vatruvius,What?!
17-09-2018T01:37:08,SpazztasticKiwi,*chloramine
17-09-2018T01:37:22,Bgrmystr2,"The dude I live with tries (and has in the past) used bleach to clean dishes. Like, dishes for food."
17-09-2018T01:37:31,Bgrmystr2,and does not think it is toxic.
17-09-2018T01:37:40,Bgrmystr2,so..
17-09-2018T01:37:51,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
17-09-2018T01:38:04,Vatruvius,Does he have cancer yet?
17-09-2018T01:38:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Little bits diluted can help clean a lot of things but it must be rinced very well
17-09-2018T01:38:57,Bgrmystr2,"Dunno, he has allergies on top of allergies.. so I mean"
17-09-2018T01:39:01,Bgrmystr2,I wouldn't know
17-09-2018T01:39:20,Vatruvius,"So, this lady never rinsed or what was it she cleaned that had ammonia?"
17-09-2018T01:39:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I know people who don’t know to thoroughly clear bleach out of a toilet after using it to clean
17-09-2018T01:40:08,Vatruvius,"Actually, being exposed to that much harmful chemicals is putting his immune system in constant overdrive resulting in hyperreactivity."
17-09-2018T01:40:26,Vatruvius,So he is basically causing his allergies upon allergies.
17-09-2018T01:40:40,Vatruvius,Open seat and...dead.
17-09-2018T01:41:17,Vatruvius,My mom use to use bleach for everything when she had me...then she found out how harmful it is and stopped immediately.
17-09-2018T01:41:22,SpazztasticKiwi,No this girl was using floor cleaner (bleach based) to clean something she should’ve been using something else for. The other chemical had ammonia apparently
17-09-2018T01:41:38,Vatruvius,She combined products?
17-09-2018T01:41:41,Vatruvius,!
17-09-2018T01:42:00,Vatruvius,Oh no...I see.
17-09-2018T01:42:27,SpazztasticKiwi,This was also a food serving place
17-09-2018T01:42:33,SpazztasticKiwi,She was fired
17-09-2018T01:42:39,Vatruvius,"Yeah, if there is ammonia then bleach will react with it and create chloramine."
17-09-2018T01:42:47,Vatruvius,Well no shit.
17-09-2018T01:42:55,Vatruvius,If you are stupid you should not be serving food!
17-09-2018T01:43:01,Vatruvius,Or be in a facility that does.
17-09-2018T01:44:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Same thread told about a guy who got caught poking holes in condoms as he waited for more customers at the gas station
17-09-2018T01:44:46,Vatruvius,:ctwokinds-RaineEep:
17-09-2018T01:45:39,Vatruvius,"""Can some please get this man a bag, he has never tried putting if over his head! Can you believe that?"""
17-09-2018T01:45:43,Vatruvius,someone*
17-09-2018T01:48:22,iliar,"Funny fact about ammonia. In Russia, if you want to buy ammonia in a regular pharmacy, the seller may refuse to sell more than 1-2 bottles of 40ml (10% concentration). Because ammonia can be used in the production of drugs."
17-09-2018T01:48:30,iliar,"However, if you go to the store for chemists, you will easily sell a few liters of ammonia (25% concentration)."
17-09-2018T01:49:02,Vatruvius,:ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:
17-09-2018T01:49:09,Vatruvius,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
17-09-2018T01:49:19,Vatruvius,Nailed it government.
17-09-2018T01:49:55,Vatruvius,"Though, I would assume you would need a license and a background check, if not openly then secretly."
17-09-2018T01:52:04,iliar,Nope. Just go to store for chemists and by as much as you want. The minimum purchase volume is 1 liter.
17-09-2018T01:52:50,Vatruvius,Ugh...
17-09-2018T01:52:54,Vatruvius,Okay then.
17-09-2018T01:53:09,Vatruvius,Note to self...need ammonia go to Russia.
17-09-2018T01:54:16,iliar,"I'm pretty sure, in your country, you can also buy ammonia."
17-09-2018T01:54:33,Vatruvius,Probably...though I bet in the US there are higher restrictions.
17-09-2018T01:55:48,iliar,"Maybe. But as far as I know in the US, radioactive materials are easier to buy than in Russia."
17-09-2018T01:55:49,Vatruvius,"I know a few people that actually bought ammonia to make bombs, small ones, for fun. They had a hell of a time buying enough without getting asked why."
17-09-2018T01:56:01,Vatruvius,That is probably ture.
17-09-2018T01:56:09,iliar,I mean officially.
17-09-2018T01:56:22,Vatruvius,Yeah.
17-09-2018T01:57:15,Vatruvius,"I am pretty sure though, unless you have a license and a known reason, you cannot purchase enough ammonia to make a large bomb."
17-09-2018T01:58:28,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s a thing some do that’s a sprinkle of salt and then cover it with an ice cube on your arm
17-09-2018T01:58:40,iliar,"To be honest, I never thought how much ammonia needed to make a bomb."
17-09-2018T01:59:24,Vatruvius,I never looked it up either.
17-09-2018T01:59:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Many of the stupid things I witnessed in high school and still see today
17-09-2018T02:00:06,Vatruvius,But I know you cannot get away with buying enough. That stuff is tracked if you do without a good reason.
17-09-2018T02:00:32,Vatruvius,"So, you know people who want to freeze a section of their arm?"
17-09-2018T02:01:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"Ive witnessed it. Like the guys who want to play nutball or punch each other in the crotch for fun or as a test of strength, I say have at it"
17-09-2018T02:01:43,iliar,"About radioactive materials. Once I tried to officially buy a radioactive source. To do this, you need a lot of licenses, approvals and other bureaucratic things."
17-09-2018T02:02:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Yea paperwork!
17-09-2018T02:02:52,Vatruvius,I assume the same here in the US for specific radioactive materials.
17-09-2018T02:03:17,iliar,Probably pick up a home laboratory like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKyIm-o30GE not possible in Russia
17-09-2018T02:05:30,iliar,But I solved the problem simply. I can not buy a source officially. For that I can go to a neighboring town and dig up the earth in the courtyard of an ordinary apartment house.
17-09-2018T02:06:39,Vatruvius,lol
17-09-2018T02:07:25,Vatruvius,"I don't know why but that amuses my, notably prejudice, view of Russia."
17-09-2018T02:07:49,Vatruvius,"I would never actually follow said prejudice, but it just seems funny."
17-09-2018T02:08:14,iliar,It's much cheaper and working too https://yadi.sk/i/YnfL-dmBomdqg
17-09-2018T02:09:30,Vatruvius,My goodness.
17-09-2018T04:23:48,Twokinds,"This might sound like an odd question, but... has Madelyn ever seen a naked Keidran in the comic before?"
17-09-2018T04:24:30,iliar,Probably yes
17-09-2018T04:24:50,Twokinds,I can't remember any time when she has.
17-09-2018T04:25:04,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: Flora..?
17-09-2018T04:25:09,Bgrmystr2,she's always naked
17-09-2018T04:26:01,Twokinds,But she's always been clothed in all the scenes they're together in.
17-09-2018T04:26:13,iliar,Flora in Kat walked on the ship naked.
17-09-2018T04:26:32,Bgrmystr2,yeah Kat wasn't wearing anything was she?
17-09-2018T04:26:33,unsteddyphoenix,Kats pretty much naked after the ship explosion
17-09-2018T04:27:12,Twokinds,She was wearing Natani's robe
17-09-2018T04:27:24,unsteddyphoenix,But just over her shoulders
17-09-2018T04:27:34,Bgrmystr2,"Also, what about after they docked and the ship explosion, they went off into the city, yeah? Wasn't there lots of Keidran in the city from the Tiger tribes?"
17-09-2018T04:28:39,iliar,"It is necessary to revise the pages. But even if it is not shown on the page, then it is reasonable to assume that Maddy saw the naked Keidran."
17-09-2018T04:28:59,iliar,Because they were often naked.
17-09-2018T04:29:56,Bgrmystr2,that's what I'd figure
17-09-2018T04:30:01,Twokinds,Ah finally found one. She was there in the tiger crowd.
17-09-2018T04:30:10,Bgrmystr2,ah what page
17-09-2018T04:30:43,Twokinds,But she's never had an up-close reaction to a Keidran disrobed.
17-09-2018T04:31:44,Twokinds,I will keep that in mind
17-09-2018T04:32:20,iliar,For example http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/905/ Iris pretty naked.
17-09-2018T04:33:26,Bgrmystr2,She could have seen kat naked in this scene http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/613/
17-09-2018T04:34:55,Twokinds,Yes that's the one I pointed out.
17-09-2018T04:35:12,Twokinds,I'm not suggesting that she's never seen a naked Keidran.
17-09-2018T04:35:26,Bgrmystr2,hmm
17-09-2018T04:36:57,Twokinds,I'm just saying she's never like shown on screen interacting with someone naked.
17-09-2018T04:37:03,iliar,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/751/
17-09-2018T04:37:21,iliar,Flora is naked
17-09-2018T04:37:29,Bgrmystr2,I feel like pointing out rabble rabble on the page after that ^
17-09-2018T04:37:38,Bgrmystr2,but yeah no direct interactions that I see
17-09-2018T04:37:47,Twokinds,Ah yeah
17-09-2018T04:37:49,Bgrmystr2,it's all just viewing as a 3rd party
17-09-2018T04:37:54,iliar,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/752/ фтв Дфгкф
17-09-2018T04:37:59,iliar,and Laura
17-09-2018T04:38:10,Bgrmystr2,that is some russian? :o
17-09-2018T04:38:12,Twokinds,Again they're not talking face to face
17-09-2018T04:38:18,Bgrmystr2,"yeh, not face to face"
17-09-2018T04:38:36,Bgrmystr2,the TK search page only goes up to page 999
17-09-2018T04:38:47,Bgrmystr2,so it won't search for anything past that
17-09-2018T04:38:56,Bgrmystr2,:/
17-09-2018T04:39:35,unsteddyphoenix,I guess...not. I cant find one.
17-09-2018T04:40:01,iliar,"http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/822/ and I'm not sure does it counts, but I thins Meddi seen a little bit more then just naked"
17-09-2018T04:40:27,Bgrmystr2,haha
17-09-2018T04:40:39,Bgrmystr2,I'm not sure maddie even looked..
17-09-2018T04:40:44,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao
17-09-2018T04:40:44,iliar,@Bgrmystr2 I just forgot to switch the keyboard layout.
17-09-2018T04:40:53,Bgrmystr2,just took the first chance to gtfo
17-09-2018T04:40:55,unsteddyphoenix,She's stealthy enough to~
17-09-2018T04:40:56,Twokinds,That's probably the closest
17-09-2018T04:41:00,Twokinds,lol
17-09-2018T04:42:29,iliar,"If you think about it, it's strange. When the clothes appear on the characters, as soon as Meddi starts talking to them."
17-09-2018T04:43:30,Twokinds,"It was actually a bit of a coincidence of circumstance, because her appearance coincided with Flora hiding the pregnancy."
17-09-2018T04:43:38,Twokinds,And Kat going a little crazy
17-09-2018T04:43:59,unsteddyphoenix,How convinient~
17-09-2018T04:44:06,Twokinds,Which are the two who usually have the least modesty of the cast.
17-09-2018T04:44:49,Twokinds,"I mean Mike and Evals have no shame too, but I always thought it'd be kinda wierd if just drew those two naked in the background in a random page. Like..."
17-09-2018T04:44:52,Twokinds,Implications...
17-09-2018T04:46:14,unsteddyphoenix,Those implications were already taken lol
17-09-2018T04:47:37,unsteddyphoenix,Does...Eric make them wear clothes? :thinking:
17-09-2018T04:48:19,Twokinds,"Uh... I'm trying to think if Eric would, but I see no reason why."
17-09-2018T04:48:34,Twokinds,Eric goes around in a bathrobe all the time.
17-09-2018T04:49:25,unsteddyphoenix,He DOES
17-09-2018T04:49:33,unsteddyphoenix,And often nothing else
17-09-2018T04:51:29,iliar,Nice theory. But http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/823/ page with Madelyn and Flora dressed. And few pages later http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/833/ Flora naked. Madelyn's Dressed Wizardry confirmed.

17-09-2018T04:52:56,Twokinds,Maddy's seen a human topless
17-09-2018T04:53:14,Twokinds,Though even Basitin don't consider being topless naked. So it still doesn't quite count.
17-09-2018T04:53:44,unsteddyphoenix,Theres DEFINTELY been bare ankles and tails lately
17-09-2018T04:53:51,unsteddyphoenix,shes seen those
17-09-2018T04:53:59,Twokinds,lol yeah very true
17-09-2018T04:55:57,unsteddyphoenix,"Shes seen all of a naked keidran, but not all at the same time lol"
17-09-2018T04:56:43,Twokinds,She is still a Basitin.
17-09-2018T04:56:59,Twokinds,"I imagine living on an island and never seeing anyone naked, then going from that to having someone talking to her face to face while not wearing anything would still be a bit disturbing."
17-09-2018T04:57:45,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. she'd have the same reaction we would if we met someone naked just standing around in public lol
17-09-2018T04:57:56,Bgrmystr2,probably.
17-09-2018T04:58:09,Twokinds,Probably
17-09-2018T04:58:52,unsteddyphoenix,It depends if she got used to keidran liberalness on the ship or if that wasnt enough time
17-09-2018T04:59:02,unsteddyphoenix,I could see her still being embarassed
17-09-2018T04:59:24,Twokinds,"""I need an adult"""
17-09-2018T04:59:44,Bgrmystr2,"At this ponit, flora IS an adult. so"
17-09-2018T04:59:47,Bgrmystr2,she's covered.
17-09-2018T04:59:54,unsteddyphoenix,"""I need an adult that isnt younger than me!"""
17-09-2018T05:01:36,ThingsAreMoving,"Seems to me, that Maddie is trying very hard to look like and act like an adult would."
17-09-2018T05:02:31,unsteddyphoenix,Well...unless shes's utilising puppy-eyes technique
17-09-2018T05:02:32,iliar,About naked chest. When furry character have naked chest without nipples it's looks okay. But when human have naked chest without nipples it's looks creepy.
17-09-2018T05:02:38,iliar,I want say when you next time will be drawing naked human characters will be better not use translucent clothes.
17-09-2018T05:02:43,iliar,"A mean art's like this https://www.patreon.com/posts/humanoid-nora-19865145 (open wings version). I like this art, but when I see translucent clothes my subconscious says ""something must be here""."
17-09-2018T05:05:14,unsteddyphoenix,I know Trace has been topless with no nipples
17-09-2018T05:07:19,ThingsAreMoving,"TV shows censor female nipples, and leave male nipples uncensored. Tom just went a step further and doesn't draw either of them. And it works, surprisingly."
17-09-2018T05:07:24,iliar,There were clouds
17-09-2018T05:07:42,unsteddyphoenix,E X T R A safe
17-09-2018T05:08:37,ThingsAreMoving,tbh if he started to draw nipples now It would look... weird
17-09-2018T05:08:57,iliar,"This is a good idea. Next time, when you will draw a naked woman's breast, just draw the male nipples. They look exactly the same, but they do not need to be censored."
17-09-2018T05:09:07,ThingsAreMoving,xD
17-09-2018T05:09:25,unsteddyphoenix,He's on to something...
17-09-2018T05:09:42,Bgrmystr2,clearly xD
17-09-2018T05:09:43,Twokinds,lol
17-09-2018T05:09:53,ThingsAreMoving,"yeah, but enjoying male nipples may make you gay"
17-09-2018T05:10:01,ThingsAreMoving,might* ?
17-09-2018T05:10:11,Twokinds,"Reminds me of the plastic surgery show, where the moment they add the implants, they have to censor the nipples."
17-09-2018T05:10:31,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha
17-09-2018T05:10:38,ThingsAreMoving,"gore and mutilation is fine, but REMOVE THEM NIPPLES"
17-09-2018T05:11:11,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's goddamn sad tom xD
17-09-2018T05:11:13,unsteddyphoenix,There was a twitter movement where dudes cute female nipples out of magazines then pasted them over their own nipples and took selfies
17-09-2018T05:11:25,unsteddyphoenix,Was pretty funny
17-09-2018T05:11:27,Bgrmystr2,haha

17-09-2018T05:27:57,Bgrmystr2,totally not just tom being up late cuz.. being up late.
17-09-2018T05:28:17,Dadrobit,He's been changing his sleep schedule in preparation for Korean timezones for years now. He's super prepared!
17-09-2018T05:28:25,ThingsAreMoving,"Is it late, or early by now? :ctwokinds-floraquestion:"
17-09-2018T05:28:36,unsteddyphoenix,Its only morning when you wake up~
17-09-2018T05:29:06,Bgrmystr2,"the difference between late and early is when the sun rises, Things."
17-09-2018T05:29:12,Bgrmystr2,Morning is when you wake up.
17-09-2018T05:29:25,Bgrmystr2,Fairly important difference :D
17-09-2018T05:30:06,iliar,Hmm ... Sometimes I travel on business trips to other time zones. But I never came up with the idea to prepare in advance for a new time zone.
17-09-2018T05:30:31,Twokinds,It's pretty easy when I'm always on Korea time.
17-09-2018T05:30:40,Bgrmystr2,xD
17-09-2018T05:30:43,ThingsAreMoving,lol
17-09-2018T05:30:48,Twokinds,But I should get to sleep
17-09-2018T05:30:59,Twokinds,Night
17-09-2018T05:31:06,ThingsAreMoving,o/ Tom

17-09-2018T05:31:59,iliar,Good night.
17-09-2018T05:32:46,Bgrmystr2,gnight tom
17-09-2018T05:33:43,Bgrmystr2,"btw I still am moving stuff in the room, those of you who were at the specific place at that specific time last night."
17-09-2018T05:37:03,ThingsAreMoving,"must be a huge room with many, many things"
17-09-2018T05:38:50,Bgrmystr2,bout.. 15ish by 11 or 12ish? 8 foot ceiling
17-09-2018T05:38:58,Bgrmystr2,I can get the dimensions one sec
17-09-2018T05:41:58,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, I don't seem to have it, but I believe it's about 15' 3inch by.. 11' 8 inch..?"
17-09-2018T05:42:02,Bgrmystr2,so nearly 15x12
17-09-2018T05:42:19,Bgrmystr2,sometimes I get confused and forget if it's 11 or 13
17-09-2018T05:42:41,Bgrmystr2,"still, pretty big room either way."
17-09-2018T05:43:53,ThingsAreMoving,yup
17-09-2018T05:44:35,ThingsAreMoving,mine's ~5m x 4m
17-09-2018T05:44:55,ThingsAreMoving,but i have a huge wardrobe splitting it in half
17-09-2018T05:46:06,Bgrmystr2,"so you have a 16x13 room, give or take"
17-09-2018T05:46:35,Bgrmystr2,"a bit bigger than mine, but not by much"
17-09-2018T05:49:01,ThingsAreMoving,big rooms are harder to maintain. small ones get clumped pretty quickly and you have no choice but to clean them often
17-09-2018T05:49:12,Dadrobit,"13x10, but about a third of it is taken up as studio space"
17-09-2018T05:49:13,ThingsAreMoving,but more space - less frequent tidying up
17-09-2018T06:01:26,Bgrmystr2,spent a lot of time moving stuff around and making a thing on my pc labeling everything important to know inside each box on my shelves
17-09-2018T06:02:48,Bgrmystr2,2/3 done already 28 boxes went through.. plus more I already know what was inside
17-09-2018T06:06:32,ThingsAreMoving,"look at you, being productive all night"
17-09-2018T06:06:37,ThingsAreMoving,...day?

17-09-2018T06:16:57,Bgrmystr2,Seeing the room come together after planning it way before even having moved here.. yeah feels good man
17-09-2018T06:25:05,ThingsAreMoving,"huh, it's this late already... gotta go to work soon™"

17-09-2018T16:57:39,Twokinds,We'll see how it goes
17-09-2018T16:58:13,ThingsAreMoving,Remember to buy a plug adapter with a power converter.
17-09-2018T16:58:55,ThingsAreMoving,"current in korea is at 220volt, not 120 like in the US"
17-09-2018T17:03:53,iliar,Many devices have universal power supplies.
17-09-2018T17:06:31,ThingsAreMoving,"Yeah, but better check if whatever electronics you're taking with you are able to run on 220V"
17-09-2018T17:09:34,iliar,Read the instructions before the electronics broke is a very useful skill.

17-09-2018T18:14:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Guys my schedule says I’m off tomorrow and the only reason I’m excited is because that means I can sleep in. Is that bad
17-09-2018T18:15:14,ThingsAreMoving,Sounds like you need that little bit of extra rest time.
17-09-2018T18:15:17,ThingsAreMoving,Enjoy it.
