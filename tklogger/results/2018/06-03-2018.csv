06-03-2018T18:05:06,TheArtApprentice,I have a question: can Steam games give you malware or is my virus protection being over protective by falsifying the updated game files?
06-03-2018T18:06:00,Bgrmystr2,"ANYTHING can give you malware, but it's unlikely that you'll have anything from there"
06-03-2018T18:06:04,Bgrmystr2,unless it's a questionable game
06-03-2018T18:06:49,Bgrmystr2,"some games are not actually games, and are just ripoffs, etc"
06-03-2018T18:07:01,Bgrmystr2,but they have to go through steam guard and such
06-03-2018T18:07:06,TheArtApprentice,Kerbal space program
06-03-2018T18:07:15,Bgrmystr2,yeah KSP isn't gonna have anything
06-03-2018T18:07:34,Bgrmystr2,that sounds like your protection software to me
06-03-2018T18:07:37,Bgrmystr2,what are you using
06-03-2018T18:07:38,TheArtApprentice,ok because its new update doesnt like my VP system
06-03-2018T18:07:47,TheArtApprentice,WebRoot
06-03-2018T18:07:52,Bgrmystr2,that may be why
06-03-2018T18:08:17,TheArtApprentice,it did this with subnautica once then gave up after I kept reinstalling it
06-03-2018T18:08:28,TheArtApprentice,subnautica that is
06-03-2018T18:08:58,Bgrmystr2,"I don't use Webroot, I use Avast"
06-03-2018T18:09:08,TheArtApprentice,it seems fine now but im going to have to wait to see
06-03-2018T18:09:22,TheArtApprentice,ya webroot likes to do stuff like this iv herd
06-03-2018T18:09:25,Bgrmystr2,I never get false positives from stuff like steam games
06-03-2018T18:09:44,TheArtApprentice,do you how to make it stop?
06-03-2018T18:10:12,Bgrmystr2,webroot is probably programmed to have a more outreaching arm in finding stuff that manipulates things for your os and such
06-03-2018T18:10:17,Bgrmystr2,I've never used it so I dunno
06-03-2018T18:10:30,Bgrmystr2,there may be an option to turn down the severity of the active shield
06-03-2018T18:10:36,Bgrmystr2,Avast has one
06-03-2018T18:11:16,TheArtApprentice,well I dont want to mess with it so im just going to have to wait till it figures out its safe
06-03-2018T18:11:21,Bgrmystr2,"I can turn Avast into Hardened mode, which looks at everything and has the highest level of security, but also gets in the way of commonly known safe things that do not-safe stuff with the system"
06-03-2018T18:11:46,Bgrmystr2,running without a process is one such thing
06-03-2018T18:12:05,Bgrmystr2,"being able to read the memory of programs and the system, etc"
06-03-2018T18:12:08,Bgrmystr2,stuff like that
06-03-2018T18:12:24,qwe304,marshmellon dumped all the psd's tom gave him from the nora cards...
06-03-2018T18:12:35,Bgrmystr2,oh did he
06-03-2018T18:12:55,qwe304,yup
06-03-2018T18:13:23,TheArtApprentice,1 minute and I can see what happins
06-03-2018T18:13:30,TheArtApprentice,*happens
06-03-2018T18:15:24,TheArtApprentice,W32.Adware.Gen thats what its saying it is
06-03-2018T18:16:12,Bgrmystr2,Yeah it seems like the virus defintions are too vague to actually recognise real ones vs false positives
06-03-2018T18:16:25,qwe304,its not
06-03-2018T18:16:28,qwe304,its real
06-03-2018T18:16:44,TheArtApprentice,ugh
06-03-2018T18:16:49,TheArtApprentice,how do you know?
06-03-2018T18:16:52,Bgrmystr2,that's a standard name Qwe
06-03-2018T18:16:56,qwe304,opened them
06-03-2018T18:17:16,qwe304,cant open the .psds' tho
06-03-2018T18:17:19,qwe304,https://imgur.com/a/Smljc
06-03-2018T18:17:25,TheArtApprentice,kerbal space program has real malware qwe?
06-03-2018T18:18:17,TheArtApprentice,whats that?
06-03-2018T18:18:35,qwe304,the files
06-03-2018T18:18:40,qwe304,from one of the dumps
06-03-2018T18:26:08,TheArtApprentice,OOOHHHH i see its happening because the file shares the same name as a real malware file its a false positive
06-03-2018T18:26:36,TheArtApprentice,the real virus is known to webroot i dont have it though
06-03-2018T18:32:42,ZephyrTWolffox,Hello
06-03-2018T18:33:49,TheArtApprentice,hi
06-03-2018T18:34:13,Dadrobit,"I mean, does Tom stipulate to ~not~ share them once he's given them to the Nora holder?"
06-03-2018T18:34:27,Dadrobit,"Honest question, haven't gotten a card yet"
06-03-2018T18:43:01,qwe304,"not sure, he hasnt specified to my knolege, but may be  a breach of patreon TOS"
06-03-2018T18:47:48,qwe304,yeah it is https://imgur.com/a/xCoD0
06-03-2018T18:50:39,Dadrobit,Was trawling through the general guidelines and just saw that through the TOS link there.
06-03-2018T19:11:37,Dadrobit,"I'm not familiar with PS at all. With only the session data, I assume you really only get access to the end result at full resolution and the workflow."
06-03-2018T19:12:27,Dadrobit,Would it also include things like custom brushsets like Tom uses for things like foliage?
06-03-2018T19:12:32,Dadrobit,foilage*
06-03-2018T19:13:00,Dadrobit,"NVM, had it right first time**"
06-03-2018T19:20:20,qwe304,"no, but all the individual layers, blending and lighting, af full res"
06-03-2018T19:25:50,Dadrobit,Just makes it easier for people to make more perfect edits with.
06-03-2018T19:42:14,DarkLinnk,good evening .

06-03-2018T20:17:02,Dadrobit,"Being sick usually sucks, but there is an upside this time."
06-03-2018T20:17:29,Dadrobit,I've played so much Morrowind over the past week that I've finally beaten the Tribunal DLC.
06-03-2018T20:17:53,Dadrobit,Only took me 16 years...
06-03-2018T20:18:26,Dadrobit,On to Solstheim!
06-03-2018T20:23:44,wolfspartan1,what is your character robit?

06-03-2018T20:35:22,wolfspartan1,solstheim is in morrowind too
06-03-2018T20:36:06,Combak,:^p was for sarcasm.
06-03-2018T20:36:16,Combak,Or just being trolly.
06-03-2018T20:36:18,wolfspartan1,oh lol
06-03-2018T20:38:30,Dadrobit,"Light armor, spear"
06-03-2018T20:38:56,Dadrobit,Restoration enough to get cure disease

06-03-2018T20:39:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,How are ya'll?
06-03-2018T20:39:48,Dadrobit,"Cruddy, but Morrowind is sustaining my will to go on."
06-03-2018T20:40:10,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Morrowind is pretty nice
06-03-2018T20:40:17,TheBeckoner,Hopefully you power doesnt go out then.
06-03-2018T20:40:20,Dadrobit,Need to work on my alteration enough to get a good levitate going.
06-03-2018T20:40:21,TheBeckoner,your*
06-03-2018T20:40:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,heard the weather is nice there
06-03-2018T20:40:26,ZephyrTWolffox,My will is sustained by Pineapple Pizza
06-03-2018T20:40:30,wolfspartan1,what race did you pick?
06-03-2018T20:40:47,Dadrobit,"Wooo, ash and blight storms! Better than AZ heat."
06-03-2018T20:40:57,Dadrobit,Khajiit
06-03-2018T20:40:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
06-03-2018T20:41:25,wolfspartan1,i went with a wood elf
06-03-2018T20:41:47,Dadrobit,Dirty cannibal!
06-03-2018T20:41:53,wolfspartan1,"light armour, bow, sword"
06-03-2018T20:41:56,wolfspartan1,yep
06-03-2018T20:43:18,wolfspartan1,not all wood elfs are some don't do the green pact
06-03-2018T20:43:36,Dadrobit,fair 'nuff
06-03-2018T20:44:09,wolfspartan1,why did you pick khajiit though?
06-03-2018T20:45:04,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Khajit with night eye as an assassin is pretty good. Bow, light armor, illusion, and one handed"
06-03-2018T20:45:27,Dadrobit,"So I can go around freeing the other khajiit at some point and be all like, ""Be free brothers!"""
06-03-2018T20:45:29,wolfspartan1,yea but you lose out on some armour
06-03-2018T20:45:46,Dadrobit,Entirely RP choice
06-03-2018T20:46:11,wolfspartan1,i almost always play as a bosmer
06-03-2018T20:46:18,Dadrobit,And you still get skills into unarmored that do help mitigate that through evasion a teensy tiny bit.
06-03-2018T20:47:28,wolfspartan1,do you play with mods or no?
06-03-2018T20:48:17,Combak,So...
06-03-2018T20:48:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yep
06-03-2018T20:48:35,Dadrobit,"Naw, totally vanilla"
06-03-2018T20:48:51,wolfspartan1,ah cool
06-03-2018T20:49:01,wolfspartan1,i play with a few mods
06-03-2018T20:49:34,wolfspartan1,mostly graphics mods but i do have one to delay to dark brotherhood assassin

06-03-2018T20:59:11,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"He said it apparently, on his IRC"
06-03-2018T20:59:21,Char89TheCharizard,does this mean no stream tonight?
06-03-2018T20:59:27,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Not sure

06-03-2018T20:59:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,if's he's sick then he should take it easy

06-03-2018T21:03:42,BadFoMo,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/chat/
06-03-2018T21:03:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless it’s for closer users

06-03-2018T21:05:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d seen that before and had no idea what it was so I passed it up
06-03-2018T21:05:48,ItsActuallyKopyKat,He's on there from time to time to stop in and say hello
06-03-2018T21:05:51,Char89TheCharizard,well if he can't stream tonight then I see no reason for being here.
06-03-2018T21:05:51,SpazztasticKiwi,But I’ll look into it - thxs 😊

06-03-2018T21:31:57,TheFDdriver,"he was banging the side of the door,XD"
06-03-2018T21:33:47,TheFDdriver,and.. i prefer the b22
06-03-2018T21:34:02,TheFDdriver,looks more boxy style
06-03-2018T21:34:26,Combak,"Tom isn't here, so a stream is looking very unlikely."
06-03-2018T21:34:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,its my fav from Subaru
06-03-2018T21:34:43,ItsActuallyKopyKat,but this conversation is gold
06-03-2018T21:34:58,TheFDdriver,same marv
06-03-2018T21:35:32,TheFDdriver,this delay tho
06-03-2018T21:40:34,TheBeckoner,Im betting no stream.
06-03-2018T21:40:36,NightMeaty22,Hello
06-03-2018T21:40:39,TheBeckoner,Hi
06-03-2018T21:40:46,TheFDdriver,hello night

06-03-2018T21:40:51,TheFDdriver,and beck
06-03-2018T21:41:13,TheFDdriver,"i am bored, and you?"
06-03-2018T21:41:21,NightMeaty22,Same
06-03-2018T21:41:43,funnyman42,No stream?
06-03-2018T21:41:54,TheFDdriver,i guess?
06-03-2018T21:42:05,funnyman42,;_;
06-03-2018T21:42:24,GameForge,rippp
06-03-2018T21:42:38,funnyman42,:ctwokinds-LauraCry:
06-03-2018T21:43:47,ItsActuallyKopyKat,check again tomorrow lol
06-03-2018T21:44:54,TorqueEmUp,"No stream, bummer"
06-03-2018T21:45:02,TorqueEmUp,guess I will just play some Forza Horizon 1
06-03-2018T21:45:20,TheFDdriver,for xbox 360?
06-03-2018T21:45:46,TorqueEmUp,"Well yeah, but playing it on the X."
06-03-2018T21:46:03,TorqueEmUp,So running at 4k
06-03-2018T21:46:11,TheFDdriver,"i can still play, right?"
06-03-2018T21:46:34,TheFDdriver,oh nvm
06-03-2018T21:47:07,TorqueEmUp,"Of course you still can play between Xbox 360, Xbox One, and Xbox One X"
06-03-2018T21:47:34,TheFDdriver,i thought you cant
06-03-2018T21:47:56,ItsActuallyKopyKat,yeah there's backwards compat
06-03-2018T21:48:23,TheFDdriver,oh i dont have new gen soo you know
06-03-2018T21:49:39,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, it all works. All 360 back-compat games run just like the 360 counterparts."
06-03-2018T21:50:00,TheFDdriver,thats cool
06-03-2018T21:50:09,TorqueEmUp,So an Xbox 360 doesn't know it's playing with somone on a Xbox One.
06-03-2018T21:50:13,TheFDdriver,that means no lag
06-03-2018T21:50:18,TorqueEmUp,It just thinks it's another 360
06-03-2018T21:50:28,TheFDdriver,and by that i mean console lag
06-03-2018T21:51:15,TorqueEmUp,You talking framerate? If I am not mistaken the Xbox One S I believe plays the game better than the original 360.
06-03-2018T21:51:52,TorqueEmUp,On the X it plays 4k 30FPS
06-03-2018T21:52:03,TheFDdriver,"yes it does, was in round 30 on bo2 with no l"
06-03-2018T21:52:10,TorqueEmUp,"While Xbox One, and Xbox One S only run the game at it's native 720p."
06-03-2018T21:53:10,TorqueEmUp,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWGoXmvilCQ
06-03-2018T21:53:18,TheFDdriver,thats cool to know

06-03-2018T22:01:02,BluePhantom90,didn't open his windows to get fresh air in I take. Need to cycle that air
06-03-2018T22:01:07,TorqueEmUp,"Ahh hell, I haven't been to the IRC in months"

06-03-2018T22:02:12,Bgrmystr2,it's an IM client
06-03-2018T22:02:19,Bgrmystr2,message boards are forums
06-03-2018T22:02:26,TorqueEmUp,"Basically any computer capable of getitng online in some way, can run IRC"
06-03-2018T22:02:27,Bgrmystr2,IRC is instant messaging

06-03-2018T22:03:44,TorqueEmUp,But that is the only place you might see Tom say something once in a blue moon.
06-03-2018T22:03:46,TheFDdriver,I will try to survive
06-03-2018T22:03:47,Bgrmystr2,you say that as if we aren't a bit weird in the stream chat
06-03-2018T22:04:04,TorqueEmUp,This is true bgr lol
06-03-2018T22:04:18,TorqueEmUp,only place besides here I mean

06-03-2018T22:04:55,Bgrmystr2,fixed that for ya
06-03-2018T22:05:07,TorqueEmUp,Eurobeat is bad for ya. Gives you speeding tickets.
06-03-2018T22:05:11,TorqueEmUp,lol

06-03-2018T22:12:34,BluePhantom90,heh Tom should have worked ahead on those pages so if this were to happen he could post the next comic page.
06-03-2018T22:13:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"that was the plan some time ago, problem is he does not have the time form that"
06-03-2018T22:17:43,Bgrmystr2,"You think he doesn't know that, Blue lol"
06-03-2018T22:23:44,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Blue...if he knew he was going to get sick he probably would have
06-03-2018T22:25:36,Bgrmystr2,"He doesn't exactly have all the time in the world to do multiple things at once, so there's that."
06-03-2018T22:28:22,BluePhantom90,"He has time, he said he doesn't work besides draw. He relaxes and doesn't go out much from the sound of it."
06-03-2018T22:29:27,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: I don't think you have a full concept of how much work beyond the physical drawing aspect goes into Twokinds
06-03-2018T22:30:20,Chippotatothefirst,Isn’t he also in college?
06-03-2018T22:30:27,GameForge,wait what?

06-03-2018T22:32:33,Bgrmystr2,it hasn't been relevant for years
06-03-2018T22:33:03,Chippotatothefirst,Lol well thanks for the update
06-03-2018T22:33:14,GameForge,"little did we know, chirp is a time traveler"

06-03-2018T22:34:11,GameForge,ehh
06-03-2018T22:34:12,GameForge,true
06-03-2018T22:34:18,Bgrmystr2,it's probably less than 2500
06-03-2018T22:34:56,GameForge,well shit
06-03-2018T22:34:59,GameForge,:(
06-03-2018T22:35:06,Bgrmystr2,yeah
06-03-2018T22:35:08,Bgrmystr2,xD
06-03-2018T22:35:16,GameForge,"well, i guess he can survive off ramen"
06-03-2018T22:35:21,Bgrmystr2,haha
06-03-2018T22:35:30,Bgrmystr2,he's paid by keenspot though
06-03-2018T22:35:34,Bgrmystr2,to have his comic hosted there
06-03-2018T22:35:35,GameForge,wai wa
06-03-2018T22:35:36,Bgrmystr2,far as I recall
06-03-2018T22:35:52,Bgrmystr2,Keenspot pays artists
06-03-2018T22:36:03,GameForge,ok...
06-03-2018T22:36:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,they do
06-03-2018T22:36:08,Bgrmystr2,I don't know any of the details though
06-03-2018T22:36:12,Bgrmystr2,so it could be little to nothing
06-03-2018T22:36:17,Bgrmystr2,or it could be outdated info
06-03-2018T22:36:18,ItsActuallyKopyKat,plus hes got a rockin patreon
06-03-2018T22:36:19,Bgrmystr2,I have no idea
06-03-2018T22:36:34,Bgrmystr2,That was already established KopyKat
06-03-2018T22:36:36,Bgrmystr2,xD
06-03-2018T22:36:37,GameForge,"kopy, we just discissed this"

06-03-2018T22:37:06,GameForge,"well, hope its enough for him to do well"
06-03-2018T22:37:14,Bgrmystr2,"seems like it is, honestly"
06-03-2018T22:37:25,Bgrmystr2,making comic just seems like it's really time-consuming
06-03-2018T22:37:29,Bgrmystr2,the creation process
06-03-2018T22:37:31,TorqueEmUp,"Taxes yes, but still making far more than the National Average"

06-03-2018T22:51:09,Bgrmystr2,He's just a guy drawin a comic.
