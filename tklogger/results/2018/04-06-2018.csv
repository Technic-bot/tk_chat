04-06-2018T02:52:30,unsteddyphoenix,Holly IRL or?
04-06-2018T03:04:52,Twokinds,"lol yes., but with less dumbells and more tablet pens"
04-06-2018T03:17:06,SpazztasticKiwi,:ctwokinds-katdryer:
04-06-2018T03:17:39,unsteddyphoenix,Theyre so cute~
04-06-2018T03:18:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Except when they try to steal your clothes
04-06-2018T03:19:20,unsteddyphoenix,Nibbly makes it look adorable
04-06-2018T03:19:25,unsteddyphoenix,So~
04-06-2018T03:20:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"Nibs yes, but my mom‚Äôs cat liked to steal my bras"
04-06-2018T03:21:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Weirdest and most annoying thing
04-06-2018T03:23:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Kiwi used to collect hairbows. My sister‚Äôs cat liked feathers. And then there‚Äôs Cookie
04-06-2018T03:25:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Just :ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:
04-06-2018T03:31:20,SpazztasticKiwi,The kitty in that video though just wanted attention. Exercise can wait another 10 minutes
04-06-2018T03:39:38,unsteddyphoenix,Agreed~
04-06-2018T03:39:44,unsteddyphoenix,Did she make a bra pile?
04-06-2018T03:39:50,unsteddyphoenix,Where she was the queen?
04-06-2018T03:42:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"She just carried them around the house mainly. If she did dump them, it was on the other end of the house in my mom‚Äôs room"
04-06-2018T03:44:30,unsteddyphoenix,Amazing
04-06-2018T03:45:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Weird more like it
04-06-2018T03:47:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"Idea: Nibs steals Nat‚Äôs wraps and while looking for them, they catch Nibs doing ribbon ballet"
04-06-2018T03:51:39,unsteddyphoenix,it all comes together
04-06-2018T03:51:54,Twokinds,XD

04-06-2018T03:54:15,unsteddyphoenix,Sometimes pets just glitch
04-06-2018T03:56:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I think I‚Äôve found my suggestion
04-06-2018T03:56:21,unsteddyphoenix,I can really picture it
04-06-2018T03:56:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"What would they even do when they see it? Just watch, wondering what was in the food they just had?"
04-06-2018T03:57:24,unsteddyphoenix,"I imagine like, Keith and Nat peeking around a corner, bug eyed"
04-06-2018T03:57:46,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúAre you seeing what I‚Äôm seeing?‚Äù
04-06-2018T03:57:53,unsteddyphoenix,Nibs wearing a tutu made from like...leaves or something.
04-06-2018T03:57:56,unsteddyphoenix,Or panties
04-06-2018T03:57:59,unsteddyphoenix,Somehow
04-06-2018T03:58:05,SpazztasticKiwi,It got better
04-06-2018T03:58:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Though maybe not the panties
04-06-2018T03:58:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"Unless Nibs cut a hole for her tail, there‚Äôd be problems"
04-06-2018T04:00:43,unsteddyphoenix,Panties have holes!
04-06-2018T04:01:40,SpazztasticKiwi,For the legs and waist. Unless she stole a pair of Kat‚Äôs that she designed or something
04-06-2018T04:02:53,SpazztasticKiwi,...and that reminds me of the ‚Äúspecial panties‚Äù sketch. Nightmares inbound
04-06-2018T04:03:09,unsteddyphoenix,That would be in there
04-06-2018T04:04:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"They turn em on, and Nibs just starts buzzing across the floor like an iPhone"
04-06-2018T04:04:57,unsteddyphoenix,RUINING her routine
04-06-2018T04:06:19,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI‚Äôm pickin up good vibrations...‚Äù
04-06-2018T04:29:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"With that, I‚Äôm gonna try to go to bed again"
04-06-2018T04:32:25,unsteddyphoenix,good luck
04-06-2018T09:56:16,Trevuxnouxe,hmmmm. Good mornin
04-06-2018T12:05:40,Trevuxnouxe,"my god, im looking at the wiki for natani. She is a goddamn female!!!! whoever made this wiki on her got it all wrong. she was a girl in the mind before she wanted to be in the brother hood. so now im changing the entire thing."
04-06-2018T12:19:24,Trevuxnouxe,http://twokinds.wikia.com/wiki/Natani fixed it
04-06-2018T12:43:31,Trevuxnouxe,"Tom, Is Natani female in the mind?"
04-06-2018T12:43:55,Trevuxnouxe,iliar is mad at me.
04-06-2018T12:44:52,Trevuxnouxe,or i'm mad at him
04-06-2018T12:47:28,iliar,Hm??? I said something wrong?
04-06-2018T12:48:27,Twokinds,Natani has a male mind.
04-06-2018T12:49:03,Xexanoth,doesn't she have both right now?(with youngtani there)
04-06-2018T12:49:43,Twokinds,"In a way, yeah."
04-06-2018T12:49:43,Trevuxnouxe,at the moment right.
04-06-2018T12:49:58,Trevuxnouxe,so were both right
04-06-2018T12:50:10,Trevuxnouxe,or both wrong
04-06-2018T13:08:34,qwe304,"personally i dont care much wether people refer to natani as male or female, but what does piss me of is when people say tom is not writing her character correctly or is ""throwing away all his character development by making him more female""."
04-06-2018T13:08:55,qwe304,people need to chill and see what tom does with natani
04-06-2018T13:13:28,Xexanoth,"eh, fans are crazy, reminds me of the dude who tried to blackmail a Studio into making his favourite ""ship"" canon"
04-06-2018T13:14:00,BadFoMo,...Wat?
04-06-2018T13:15:21,Xexanoth,http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/voltron-legendary-defender-fan-blackmails-studio
04-06-2018T13:35:36,Dadrobit,"Yeah, TwoKinds has had its fair share of crazy ""fans"" through the years. Taina, He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named, uncountable drama-bombers... It happens."
04-06-2018T13:41:39,Dadrobit,"Been around the community since around 08-09, so I've seen some shit lol."
04-06-2018T13:47:57,Xexanoth,"i've only really hang around since picarto streaming became a thing, so i pretty much missed everything except the endless ""what is natanis gender"" discussion(which somehow many of the COMIC PAGE X posts on the forum developed into)"
04-06-2018T14:32:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"I never knew he had a Patreon, let alone that he streamed here"
04-06-2018T14:36:43,BadFoMo,Who; He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named?
04-06-2018T14:40:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you‚Äôre talking to me, I mean Tom"
04-06-2018T14:45:12,BadFoMo,"...How could you not know? He's been doing this for a few years now, and I think you've been here long enough to know that."
04-06-2018T14:45:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"I only learned of his existence through Mark, and he rarely mentioned anything further than the comic itself"
04-06-2018T14:47:28,BadFoMo,"So, you didn't know about the sketch streams or how they work?"
04-06-2018T14:47:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"Not in the beginning when I first dropped in, but I‚Äôve learned"
04-06-2018T14:49:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Not entirely sure that all the fans that do cross over between the brothers know Tom streams
04-06-2018T15:12:35,SpazztasticKiwi,The car next to me in this parking lot had a yapping chihuahua. They have finally left
04-06-2018T15:12:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Blissful silence
04-06-2018T15:25:22,Twokinds,bleh
04-06-2018T15:25:32,Twokinds,I accidentally tried drinking coffee with my lungs
04-06-2018T15:25:42,Twokinds,It didn't go well.
04-06-2018T15:35:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe your lungs needed coffee too
04-06-2018T15:35:30,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúInhale the flavor‚Äù
04-06-2018T15:36:32,iliar,@SpazztasticKiwi When you talk about Mark you mean Markiplier?
04-06-2018T15:36:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Yes
04-06-2018T15:37:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Only Mark I know if you don‚Äôt count nicknames
04-06-2018T15:43:22,iliar,It's funny. At me all was on the contrary. I've never heard of Mark before I started reading TK.
04-06-2018T15:43:26,iliar,"Sometimes when I watching YouTube I found video with Mark and thought ""Hm... This guy looks familiar interesting who is it. Oh. It's Tom's brother."""
04-06-2018T15:53:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn‚Äôt watch many YouTubers till Mark appeared in my recommended
04-06-2018T15:55:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Then I found out why people kept asking me about some guy names Markiplier after I dyed my hair red
04-06-2018T15:56:20,SpazztasticKiwi,*named
04-06-2018T15:58:32,Dadrobit,Just got back from the store. Had some Starbucks Mexican Mocha. Hesitant on recommending it.
04-06-2018T15:59:07,Dadrobit,"Tastes really good, but there's like... A cinnamon(?) twist in it that leaves a tiny sting at the back of your throat."
04-06-2018T15:59:42,Dadrobit,Otherwise it's very tasty though. It's an odd combo.
04-06-2018T16:01:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt do Starbucks
04-06-2018T16:01:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Too expensive and I can‚Äôt have that much sugar
04-06-2018T16:01:40,Dadrobit,Maybe it's cayane pepper actually.
04-06-2018T16:02:05,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I totally get that."
04-06-2018T16:02:41,Dadrobit,It's not a regular thing for me. Just saw it was a different looking version and got it as a treat while I was at Bashas'.
04-06-2018T16:03:13,Dadrobit,My coffee consumption has dropped considerably since I got out of security lol.
04-06-2018T16:04:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll drink coffee with creamer or black. And I don‚Äôt add anything to my tea
04-06-2018T16:04:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless I‚Äôm sick and need honey
04-06-2018T16:06:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm more like my dad in that aspect. Though I don‚Äôt add liquor like he did
04-06-2018T16:08:02,Dadrobit,Never mixed the two myself.
04-06-2018T16:08:59,SpazztasticKiwi,He once left it in my reach once. Tastes oily if that makes sense
04-06-2018T16:09:26,Dadrobit,"Oh, and looked up the ingredient list. The Mexican Mocha does in fact have cayenne pepper and cinnamon flavoring"
04-06-2018T16:10:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Doesn‚Äôt sound very appealing
04-06-2018T16:10:03,Dadrobit,I can kind of understand what that might be like.
04-06-2018T16:10:36,Dadrobit,"It tastes really good on the tongue, very refreshing. But the back of the throat it gets a bit too sting-y."
04-06-2018T16:10:49,SpazztasticKiwi,He turned around and saw me with it and I believe that‚Äôs the fastest I‚Äôve seen him move
04-06-2018T16:11:12,Dadrobit,lol
04-06-2018T16:11:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember my mom asked if why he put it where I could reach when he knows I liked to drink coffee too
04-06-2018T16:12:42,Dadrobit,My folks forbade me from drinking coffee until I was pretty much an adult.
04-06-2018T16:13:03,Dadrobit,It was more of a taboo for me growing up than alcohol.
04-06-2018T16:13:19,SpazztasticKiwi,My mom hates coffee and alcohol. My dad loved both
04-06-2018T16:13:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Too much to be honest
04-06-2018T16:13:57,Dadrobit,"Mind you, the house didn't have any heavy drinkers, but wine was often served to everyone (even the yougins) at parties like Hanukkah."
04-06-2018T16:13:58,Xexanoth,"my parents used the approach of black coffee is real bitter and kids don't like it approach, still don't like coffee"
04-06-2018T16:15:23,Dadrobit,"Hm, seems people really like the MM variant. 4.1 on Amazon. Most of the reviews under 5 stars are for damaged goods complaints."
04-06-2018T16:15:47,SpazztasticKiwi,The wat
04-06-2018T16:15:58,SpazztasticKiwi,You mean alcohol
04-06-2018T16:16:01,SpazztasticKiwi,?
04-06-2018T16:16:28,Dadrobit,Mexican Mocha I was talking about earlier. Was looking up how other people are rating it to see if my opinions are widespread or not.
04-06-2018T16:16:39,Dadrobit,Seems most folks love it.
04-06-2018T16:17:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"As a side note, I‚Äôm eating nachos and burritos and Bagheera‚Äôs giving me the Hungry Eyes"
04-06-2018T16:17:57,Dadrobit,"Today is Tuesday. Therefore, there will be tacos."
04-06-2018T16:18:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"Well there‚Äôs a taco too, but just the one"
04-06-2018T16:21:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm gettin ‚ÄúGive the kitty your food. Give the kitty your food...‚Äù vibes over here
04-06-2018T16:23:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I also believe I know what to get him for his birthday
04-06-2018T16:32:39,SpazztasticKiwi,But I believe I‚Äôm just gonna work on a project I thought of the other day
04-06-2018T16:33:22,Dadrobit,I should probably work on my own homework at some point today. Just got this weeks workload uploaded earlier.
04-06-2018T16:36:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Hey Tom do you use colored pencils at all
04-06-2018T16:47:37,Twokinds,I've tried color pencils a few times
04-06-2018T16:47:40,Twokinds,I'm not good at it.
04-06-2018T16:48:00,Twokinds,Physical media is something I don't have any skill in.
04-06-2018T16:49:29,iliar,Hm. You pencils sketches looks good.
04-06-2018T16:50:23,iliar,Of course I mean you non color sketches.
04-06-2018T16:50:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Funny. I‚Äôm no good at most digital stuff
04-06-2018T16:53:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I like my prismacolor pencils. They can blend and have some rich smooth color
04-06-2018T16:54:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"When I did Ethan‚Äôs 500k sub drawing, I had people asking if it was painted"
04-06-2018T16:56:23,Twokinds,"With pencil sketches, I have to put a lot of effort into it. I find it quite difficult."
04-06-2018T16:57:54,Trevuxnouxe,same
04-06-2018T17:00:01,SpazztasticKiwi,So you do commissions in real life but it‚Äôs more of a concentration thing than tablet work
04-06-2018T17:06:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I spilled some burrito sauce on my phone. Hold on
04-06-2018T17:13:39,Twokinds,"mmm, burrito"
04-06-2018T17:13:54,iliar,I'm not artist. So I can mistaken. But in my opinion traditional works have two biggest problems.
04-06-2018T17:13:57,iliar,"1) ctrl+z not working 2) colors not so cool. Non color sketches have not this problem because they have not colors. In my opinion, many traditional works hav"
04-06-2018T17:15:28,Dadrobit,"100% on the artist and the materials involved. I find a lot of digital art doesn't have the pleasantness of traditional because so many digital pieces look too ""shiny"" or ""glossy"" if you get my meaning."
04-06-2018T17:17:18,Dadrobit,The serendipity of human random error and live material is very rare in digital pieces.
04-06-2018T17:17:47,Dadrobit,Other than obvious things like bad color matching and proportions.
04-06-2018T17:19:29,Twokinds,My biggest problem with physical mediums is that it's slow
04-06-2018T17:19:39,Twokinds,"I can't change a pencil's brush size, or fill an area"
04-06-2018T17:19:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Slow and steady wins the race
04-06-2018T17:19:57,Twokinds,"It's just slooow shading, or brushes, or ink."
04-06-2018T17:20:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Also phone is taken apart and now drying
04-06-2018T17:24:47,Dadrobit,:/ My professor is not on her game with giving us the proper material.
04-06-2018T17:25:10,Dadrobit,Everything for the week should be unloaded on Monday morning for a full week to work on it.
04-06-2018T17:26:02,Dadrobit,"But it took until midday today to get the work guides to us, and she still has yet to unlock the modules that actually let us do and submit the work."
04-06-2018T17:26:45,Dadrobit,#QualityOrganization
04-06-2018T17:28:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"Dear professor, ‚ÄúDaddy‚Äù says your not doing your job."
04-06-2018T17:28:23,iliar,"@Dadrobit Yeah. Latex fur, glowing tongues and etc. I understand what you mean."
04-06-2018T17:28:37,SpazztasticKiwi,How‚Äôs that sound
04-06-2018T17:28:47,iliar,"But in my opinion even when the artist can draw well, traditional works have not enough saturated colors. For example this artist draw well https://vk.com/photo-78666722_456239514?all=1 but colors not perfect"
04-06-2018T17:29:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Not very vibrant. Kinda muted
04-06-2018T17:29:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I‚Äôm a sucker for that thicc color
04-06-2018T17:38:09,Dadrobit,Not sure how much I want to rock the boat more than I already am. Already sent in one complaint about grading where she docked me points for not doing a page of homework.
04-06-2018T17:38:45,Dadrobit,One of the assignments dictated that the workload for example 5-5 on pages 27-28 had to be done.
04-06-2018T17:39:01,Dadrobit,I got docked for not doing the assignment on page 29.
04-06-2018T17:39:20,Dadrobit,Go figure.
04-06-2018T17:39:55,Dadrobit,Got a response that read that she felt it was obvious that 29 was included in that range because it's a subsection of example 5-5.
04-06-2018T17:40:24,Dadrobit,I'm a little salty about that tbh.
04-06-2018T17:44:01,Bgrmystr2,I'd question that
04-06-2018T17:44:19,Bgrmystr2,"if it doesn't say you had to do it it being ""obvious"" is bullshit"
04-06-2018T17:46:09,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I told her as much and requested that her assignment description be updated so as not to trick other students."
04-06-2018T17:46:20,Dadrobit,It's not updated still.
04-06-2018T17:48:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"If it‚Äôs ‚Äúdo example 5-5 on pages 27-28‚Äù, including page 29 is not obvious. In fact, it‚Äôs obviously excluded from the assignment description"
04-06-2018T17:51:16,SpazztasticKiwi,And therefore is no fault of anyone but the writer of the assignment description. It‚Äôs the first rule of writing instructions of any kind; make what the end product is supposed to be blatantly obvious
04-06-2018T17:51:45,Dadrobit,"Indeed, and in another assignment she specifically states that we were not to do the whole thing because that would be too much work."
04-06-2018T17:53:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"If it‚Äôs a reoccurring thing, you could try taking this evidence - assignment instructions paired with her conflicting emails - to the office and ask them to see if they can see some clarification, and/or get it for you"
04-06-2018T17:54:01,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôd be what I‚Äôd do

04-06-2018T17:58:04,Dadrobit,"If I continue to see issues like these, I'll certainly bring it up to the course review board, but at this point, missing a few points out of the total workload is not yet enough of a bother for me to add any more bother to myself."
04-06-2018T18:02:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh yeah. The semester review. When the teachers are graded
04-06-2018T18:02:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Wish they had that in high school like they did college
04-06-2018T18:05:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember in high school a senior took a test copy from the teacher‚Äôs desk while he was turned around
04-06-2018T18:06:31,SpazztasticKiwi,He was a bit of a teacher‚Äôs pet but still got in trouble when an anonymous note was left after class
04-06-2018T18:06:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I liked that teacher
04-06-2018T18:07:26,Dadrobit,"Mmmm, something similar to that happened around here last year when the testbanks a lot of teachers use to make tests was leaked and a buuuuunch of students had to re-take their finals with completely new material that the teachers that used testbanks had"

04-06-2018T18:08:50,Dadrobit,"Both my folks don't use them, so they were fine. But it hit a ton of teachers."
04-06-2018T18:11:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I used to have a teacher who made her own tests and made up to 3 different forms of it

04-06-2018T23:54:10,unsteddyphoenix,"Huh, I dont remember it, go figure."
04-06-2018T23:54:15,CrRAR,"wait...when you say ""designs""... all of them?"
04-06-2018T23:54:19,unsteddyphoenix,"Def voting for that if it comes up again, then"
04-06-2018T23:54:42,CrRAR,lol the one I am talking about was JUST for Red.
04-06-2018T23:54:44,unsteddyphoenix,"Uhh, probably not. Who has really changed that much besides like, Trace and Red?"
04-06-2018T23:55:05,unsteddyphoenix,just red is good
04-06-2018T23:55:26,CrRAR,"I guess it depends how early, Tom always says that so much changed early on."
04-06-2018T23:55:40,CrRAR,Even the gender combo of Trace/Flora.
04-06-2018T23:55:49,unsteddyphoenix,true true.
04-06-2018T23:55:58,unsteddyphoenix,And Kat's completely different
04-06-2018T23:57:18,CrRAR,"yeah, the ""Spotted Kitty"" sketch was getting pretty close to final I think for Kat, but still a early design."
04-06-2018T23:57:52,CrRAR,At least I always thought that was development work for her.
04-06-2018T23:58:38,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah it was probably an inspiration at least.
04-06-2018T23:59:08,CrRAR,Yeah... lol basically just had more of dog genetics.
04-06-2018T23:59:32,CrRAR,Cat ears though were still prominent at that point.
04-06-2018T23:59:54,CrRAR,spots ‚úì
04-06-2018T23:59:57,unsteddyphoenix,"mm, she ended up with a cat-ish face and like, a dog tail."
