05-08-2018T01:51:32,Dadrobit,Death Valley Queen was all I listened to after I broke up with my second girlfriend.

05-08-2018T01:54:43,Dadrobit,"At that age, it was just all band inter-relationships."
05-08-2018T01:55:03,Dadrobit,"""Oh, you're in the band? So am I! I guess we're dating now."""
05-08-2018T01:55:17,unsteddyphoenix,At 13? Hm.
05-08-2018T01:55:24,unsteddyphoenix,I was the shortest dude I knew until I was like 15-16
05-08-2018T01:55:58,unsteddyphoenix,Man highschool was not fun
05-08-2018T01:56:07,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs a pic on Facebook of Mark and Tom when they were high school age
05-08-2018T01:56:24,Dadrobit,High School was weird for me.
05-08-2018T01:56:33,Dadrobit,Father taught at the same school.
05-08-2018T01:56:43,unsteddyphoenix,"Did you call him ""father"""
05-08-2018T01:56:45,Dadrobit,"He was/is one of the ""cool teachers"""
05-08-2018T01:57:14,Dadrobit,"So I suddenly had a lot of ""friends"" who just wanted to get closer to him and hear what it was like living with him."
05-08-2018T01:57:29,Dadrobit,"Nah, I call him dad or pops."
05-08-2018T01:58:10,SpazztasticKiwi,BOY
05-08-2018T01:58:15,unsteddyphoenix,Huh.
05-08-2018T01:58:19,unsteddyphoenix,Thats a weird thing
05-08-2018T01:58:28,Dadrobit,"Early high school was also the time I was in the ""Anti-Furry League"". Fuckin' cringe. I think I told that story before."
05-08-2018T01:59:04,SpazztasticKiwi,And look how you‚Äôve grown
05-08-2018T01:59:13,Dadrobit,"Yeah, he was Automotive, Welding, and Electronics at that time IIRC."
05-08-2018T01:59:20,unsteddyphoenix,And look how you've been assimilated*
05-08-2018T01:59:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I used to care about what everyone thought
05-08-2018T01:59:50,Dadrobit,"Legit, in one of my year books, one of the signatures is an old buddy of mine warning me to not let furries get to me."
05-08-2018T01:59:56,unsteddyphoenix,"I dont remember having a teacher so ""cool"" that people would suck up to their kids"
05-08-2018T02:00:02,Dadrobit,Lemme see if I can't find it.
05-08-2018T02:00:06,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
05-08-2018T02:00:21,unsteddyphoenix,You should draw him something then hit him up
05-08-2018T02:01:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I do need to go to bed...
05-08-2018T02:04:41,Dadrobit,Found it! https://i.imgur.com/m7NXEPY.jpg
05-08-2018T02:05:35,Dadrobit,"Also, my dad managed it. I recall back when he used to teach electronics, he spent the first day of class showing how you can turn a disposable camera, into a taser."
05-08-2018T02:06:10,Dadrobit,And he'd keep the camera/taser on top of his white board in case anyone fell asleep or was slacking off.
05-08-2018T02:06:26,Dadrobit,Got your head on the desk? Zap to the back of the neck.
05-08-2018T02:06:33,unsteddyphoenix,Boy that would

05-08-2018T02:07:33,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, that seems fairly fucking mean to do to begin with"
05-08-2018T02:08:01,Dadrobit,"Oh shit, you want one that wouldn't fly? Early on he was a woodworking teacher. His final for his third year class was ""Make whatever you want""."
05-08-2018T02:08:09,Dadrobit,One kid made a working crossbow.
05-08-2018T02:08:16,Dadrobit,He got an A
05-08-2018T02:08:56,Bgrmystr2,"see, that's cool lol"
05-08-2018T02:09:01,Dadrobit,"The taser ran off of camera batteries, it's uncomfortable and startling when you're asleep, but completely harmless."
05-08-2018T02:09:05,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds like he deserved an A
05-08-2018T02:09:29,Dadrobit,I remember my siblings and I used to spend afternoon running around playing tag with them.
05-08-2018T02:09:34,Dadrobit,afternoons*
05-08-2018T02:09:40,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
05-08-2018T02:10:17,Dadrobit,"Specifically, the capacitors in the camera, not the batteries themselves."
05-08-2018T02:11:23,Dadrobit,He's very old school in teaching. Leaning back in your chair means you're about to have the rest of the chair kicked out from underneath you kinda stuff.
05-08-2018T02:11:44,Dadrobit,But the kids love him.
05-08-2018T02:11:52,Bgrmystr2,"See, I would not have liked him"
05-08-2018T02:12:02,FenceEqualizer,"Can I just state, Damn Robit I swear you lived a charmed life."
05-08-2018T02:12:28,Dadrobit,He curses like a sailor and lets his kids choose the music to play on the shop stereo system.
05-08-2018T02:12:35,unsteddyphoenix,It is amazing how he got HERE of all places.
05-08-2018T02:12:42,unsteddyphoenix,Also I gotta leaaaan though.
05-08-2018T02:12:48,Dadrobit,"Yeah, go figure."
05-08-2018T02:13:45,Dadrobit,The kids choosing the playlist almost bit him in the ass one time when the song that came on was ICP - Fuck The World just as a district manager was doing a tour of his shop.
05-08-2018T02:14:14,unsteddyphoenix,Lol you had kids listening to ICP
05-08-2018T02:14:28,Dadrobit,It was fine. It was the censored version.
05-08-2018T02:15:10,unsteddyphoenix,Did you see that vid of the ICP guy and his furry daughter
05-08-2018T02:15:19,Dadrobit,"Also, Fence. Trust me. It wasn't all that great tbh."
05-08-2018T02:15:35,Dadrobit,"Wait, what, Furry Juggalos?"
05-08-2018T02:15:38,Dadrobit,I gotta see this.

05-08-2018T02:17:40,unsteddyphoenix,Why do you shun this gift
05-08-2018T02:17:45,FenceEqualizer,Oh god the cringe!
05-08-2018T02:17:47,Dadrobit,I'm watching the rest
05-08-2018T02:18:11,Dadrobit,"""My mom says he's been broke since the 90's"""
05-08-2018T02:18:14,Dadrobit,Oshit
05-08-2018T02:19:17,Dadrobit,"I mean, props to the guy for being supportive. Even if he is broken as shit"
05-08-2018T02:19:21,Dadrobit,broke*
05-08-2018T02:19:40,unsteddyphoenix,What a good supportive dad...
05-08-2018T02:20:27,FenceEqualizer,Outrageously insane snaky krooks. Well I'll give it to him. Cool to see a dad being supportive. Though that start was like a kick to the gut.
05-08-2018T02:20:33,Dadrobit,Maybe save some money by not buying so much face paint
05-08-2018T02:20:40,unsteddyphoenix,SSSSSNAKES
05-08-2018T02:20:59,unsteddyphoenix,It's kinda wholesome in a hilarious way
05-08-2018T02:22:38,Dadrobit,Well. That's a thing I've watched now.
05-08-2018T02:22:51,Dadrobit,Violent J has changed.
05-08-2018T02:24:12,unsteddyphoenix,I...wouldnt know.
05-08-2018T02:26:38,Dadrobit,One of the Scout Leaders in my troop was a Juggalo. Listened to a lot of ICP.
05-08-2018T02:26:40,FenceEqualizer,Hard to believe it's the same dude from the insane clown posse
05-08-2018T02:26:59,FenceEqualizer,Well maybe not hard to believe but still
05-08-2018T03:10:00,FenceEqualizer,Welp heading to bed. Night all.:zzz:

05-08-2018T13:15:30,iliar,"One guy says that you allowed him personally to publish a TDM translation. I think he's lying. But just in case, I want to clarify."
05-08-2018T13:19:48,iliar,Oooh... You published Fidget?!
05-08-2018T13:20:44,Twokinds,I don't think I've said that to anyone.
05-08-2018T13:26:14,JamesBSquirrel3,Say can you try Fidget + Nibbly together? Anything could need something?
05-08-2018T13:27:19,JamesBSquirrel3,Or perhaps their eating their cake or mashmellos?
05-08-2018T13:30:52,Twokinds,I think that was a sketch I did once
05-08-2018T13:31:45,iliar,I'm glad you took the time to finish Fidget.
05-08-2018T13:32:46,iliar,"It's frustrating when you draw good sketches on the streams, but leave them unfinished."

05-08-2018T15:13:42,iliar,I found the stream where Terry was drawn
05-08-2018T15:13:47,Dadrobit,"Wow, I remember that one."
05-08-2018T15:14:30,iliar,And it upsets me that these sketches have not been published.
05-08-2018T15:16:07,iliar,And sometimes I thinking about noracarded this one https://yadi.sk/i/B-GmD2QZ3ZxAu4
05-08-2018T15:40:30,Twokinds,Man I don't remember half the sketches in that stream
05-08-2018T15:40:37,Twokinds,I wish I could draw that fast though
05-08-2018T15:43:17,iliar,Hmmm....
05-08-2018T15:45:34,iliar,But I hope you do not doubt that it was you who drew these sketches.
05-08-2018T15:53:24,Twokinds,lool
05-08-2018T15:55:41,TheGamePlayer,crashes through the wall
05-08-2018T15:55:45,TheGamePlayer,Ouch
05-08-2018T15:55:50,TheGamePlayer,That hurt
05-08-2018T16:06:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw a dude driving his motorcycle and smoking a cigarette. Tell me - how does that work
05-08-2018T16:57:32,Ordithus,I'm a fan of the Maren + Raine cuteness from that stream
05-08-2018T16:58:39,Twokinds,Me too :D
05-08-2018T17:02:00,TorqueEmUp,So what games you been into lately?
05-08-2018T17:20:02,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, I played that one too. Tis a good one."
05-08-2018T17:26:02,TorqueEmUp,HAHA! You ain't kidding
05-08-2018T17:28:14,TorqueEmUp,Alright I'm done talking to nobody. Back to work.
05-08-2018T17:29:04,TorqueEmUp,:P

05-08-2018T17:41:54,Bgrmystr2,"@Kiwi ""Look ma, one hand"" ?"
05-08-2018T18:06:17,TheGamePlayer,decides to repair the wall
05-08-2018T18:07:17,TheGamePlayer,"There's nothing to do, except swimming witch I don't want to do."
05-08-2018T18:07:58,TheGamePlayer,"Well drawing, but Im to lazy to grab my notebook and pencil"
05-08-2018T21:00:30,TheBeckoner,Hm I watched a bit of that video Unsteddy linked. It was hard to watch tbh
05-08-2018T21:13:32,Vatruvius,I have figured out a portion of the plot to my web comic! :ptv-hearts:
05-08-2018T21:13:54,TheGamePlayer,Cool
05-08-2018T21:13:58,TheGamePlayer,!!!
05-08-2018T21:15:15,Vatruvius,"Yeah, it took quite a while."
05-08-2018T21:34:59,Ordithus,"Congrats, Vatru!  To progress :champagne_glass:"
05-08-2018T21:37:57,Vatruvius,Ohh yeah!
05-08-2018T21:38:33,Vatruvius,I am actually sitting in my bed right now typing away as the story is now coming together! :D
05-08-2018T21:39:48,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
05-08-2018T21:45:54,Vatruvius,I have an interesting question actually about my web comic. How would any of you feel about the pages of my comic having ambient sound? Like the sounds of the city or of a thunderstorm of something seamlessly looping in the background of the pages?
05-08-2018T21:46:14,Vatruvius,or something*
05-08-2018T21:47:56,Ordithus,Hmm... that's pretty unique.  Could be a neat addition if well done... could be annoying or gimmicky if not.
05-08-2018T21:49:41,Vatruvius,I would not allow it to be annoying or gimmicky.
05-08-2018T21:50:02,Vatruvius,If it did not fit well then I probably won't do it but if I could get it to work just right I think it could be cool.
05-08-2018T21:50:41,Vatruvius,Just to add some ambiance.
05-08-2018T21:50:41,Ordithus,Something to help set the mood?
05-08-2018T21:50:45,Vatruvius,Yup.
05-08-2018T21:51:26,Vatruvius,To better immerse the reader into the universe of the comic.
05-08-2018T21:51:42,Ordithus,"Makes me think of cinematic sequences you see in some video games, where it's like a comic strip with voiceover and sound.  I always have liked those."
05-08-2018T21:51:50,Ordithus,There's probably a name for that.
05-08-2018T21:53:23,Vatruvius,Probably.
05-08-2018T21:54:18,Ordithus,Also an oppurtunity for some subliminal messaging...
05-08-2018T21:54:33,Vatruvius,"But there will be no voice over, just ambient sound. Maybe if there is market scene or something similar there could be like crowd mumbling? Nothing discernible but something to really set the scene without distracting from the story and dialogue."
05-08-2018T21:54:47,Vatruvius,"Ohh yes, all the subliminal messaging."
05-08-2018T21:54:50,Ordithus,yvan eht nioj
05-08-2018T21:55:55,Vatruvius,Can't tell if that is suppose to be a message or misplacement of the home row...
05-08-2018T21:56:19,Vatruvius,lol
05-08-2018T21:56:22,Vatruvius,I get it.
05-08-2018T21:56:28,Ordithus,"I like the idea, and I can't imagine it would be too much to implement.  The hardest part would be finding the right sound clips"
05-08-2018T21:56:50,Ordithus,And doing it legally :ptv-uneasy:
05-08-2018T21:56:55,Vatruvius,"Yeah, maybe I can find a cool sound guy who would like to work on something like that with me."
05-08-2018T21:57:08,Vatruvius,"Or girl, I am not sexist."
05-08-2018T21:57:32,Vatruvius,"Ohh yes, I hope to create my own sounds or get some without legal ties."
05-08-2018T22:00:13,Bgrmystr2,"Vatru : Male audiophiles ONLY Please, notsexist, just terrible :V"
05-08-2018T22:00:15,TheBeckoner,Hmm the speed of the sounds being played is important too. Dont want the reader to feel rushed I dont think. Unless it calls for that of course.
05-08-2018T22:01:06,Bgrmystr2,"everyone reads at a different speed, so having a sound effect when the user reads is not going to work if it's all on one page"
05-08-2018T22:01:18,Bgrmystr2,unless you do it like prequel did
05-08-2018T22:01:38,Bgrmystr2,though I don't think they had any sound.. it would have been fairly easy with what they did
05-08-2018T22:01:44,Ordithus,That wizardry?
05-08-2018T22:01:58,Bgrmystr2,especially *those* pages in particular
05-08-2018T22:02:03,Bgrmystr2,the ones I won't mention
05-08-2018T22:02:09,Bgrmystr2,crazy shit
05-08-2018T22:02:31,Ordithus,"I think Vatru means one ambient per page, but that is also an interesting thought"
05-08-2018T22:02:41,Ordithus,"And yeah, that shit was cray"
05-08-2018T22:02:48,Vatruvius,"The sounds effects won't really set a pace for the reading. If it were it would generally be calm and easy going like gentle rain storm of something. Nothing overpowering, just nice ambiance."
05-08-2018T22:03:04,Bgrmystr2,Well I mean like.. the comic can be set up like that so the ambience applies and can change as the user is finished
05-08-2018T22:03:34,Bgrmystr2,the scrolling page really helped
05-08-2018T22:04:09,Vatruvius,"Maybe, but I am not sure how I would go about doing that. I can certainly see having a looping sound effect but to have a dynamic one that changes or is based off of average read speeds seems difficult to me."
05-08-2018T22:04:27,Vatruvius,"I see, so attach it to the scrolling of tha page."
05-08-2018T22:04:29,Vatruvius,the*
05-08-2018T22:04:47,Bgrmystr2,yeah in prequel a few pages changed as you scrolled down
05-08-2018T22:05:07,Bgrmystr2,it had a few wonky moment for me when nothing happened or whatever but I mean
05-08-2018T22:05:11,Bgrmystr2,it's gonna happen
05-08-2018T22:05:18,Vatruvius,"That could work, though I like to read Twokinds, Yosh!, and AI as a full page on my screen and just read."
05-08-2018T22:05:42,Bgrmystr2,"but that kinda stuff, scrolling the page down, changing the entire environment, the visuals and audio all change"
05-08-2018T22:05:59,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, at that point you may as well be doing a VN"
05-08-2018T22:06:00,Vatruvius,So I feel like the ambient/looping approach encompasses everyone's different methods of reading and speed at which they read/look at the page.
05-08-2018T22:06:41,Vatruvius,"Yeah, I am very much still doing a still image web comic."
05-08-2018T22:06:46,Bgrmystr2,"tis why prequel had the next button, basically"
05-08-2018T22:06:58,Bgrmystr2,so ppl can go to the next page when they're ready
05-08-2018T22:07:10,Bgrmystr2,and your comic can follow suit
05-08-2018T22:07:37,Ordithus,It's going to be really hard to make prints.
05-08-2018T22:07:46,Vatruvius,"This idea came to me originally from the idea of having the pages be animated, like in a rain storm the rain would be animated and I would have sound to pair with it. However, this quickly turned out to be a lot of work in my head and I decided to ditch"
05-08-2018T22:07:49,Vatruvius,the animations.
05-08-2018T22:08:03,Vatruvius,I then thought about keeping the audio.
05-08-2018T22:08:08,Bgrmystr2,animated pages for comics are brilliant
05-08-2018T22:08:10,Vatruvius,That is where I am at now.
05-08-2018T22:08:15,Bgrmystr2,"they're very rare, but very awesome"
05-08-2018T22:08:28,Bgrmystr2,you'd actually get a lot of readers just from having panels animated
05-08-2018T22:09:06,Ordithus,"People like doodads and gizmos, they get the attention."
05-08-2018T22:09:12,Vatruvius,"The animations would purely be just ambient just like the audio. Like the rain, perhaps a car passes by, etc."
05-08-2018T22:09:30,Ordithus,Little things that add something to the experience
05-08-2018T22:09:37,Vatruvius,Exactly.
05-08-2018T22:09:43,Vatruvius,And don't take a month per page.
05-08-2018T22:09:48,Vatruvius,XD
05-08-2018T22:09:56,Bgrmystr2,I was thinking of like.. lemmy find it
05-08-2018T22:10:07,Ordithus,Gotta find a balance
05-08-2018T22:10:20,Vatruvius,Yeah.
05-08-2018T22:10:38,Bgrmystr2,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/1009/ That one panel.. with Natani
05-08-2018T22:10:56,Bgrmystr2,"the hair blowing in the wind, the petals floating by"
05-08-2018T22:11:00,Bgrmystr2,all the roses sparkling
05-08-2018T22:11:08,Bgrmystr2,that kinda shit
05-08-2018T22:11:20,Vatruvius,lol
05-08-2018T22:11:23,Ordithus,Barry White playing in the background...
05-08-2018T22:11:25,Vatruvius,"Yeah, just ambient stuff."
05-08-2018T22:11:46,Bgrmystr2,haha ord xD
05-08-2018T22:12:24,Vatruvius,"Totally could see with something like that having the grass blowing in the weed, like the waves of grass, or hair moving in the wind. Though hair moving would be a bit of stretch because now I am animating characters."
05-08-2018T22:12:33,Vatruvius,wind* not weed
05-08-2018T22:13:02,Bgrmystr2,I was only thinking of like single important panels
05-08-2018T22:13:03,Bgrmystr2,not all of em
05-08-2018T22:13:11,Vatruvius,Yeah.
05-08-2018T22:13:18,Vatruvius,Definitely.
05-08-2018T22:13:30,Vatruvius,I was thinking each page kinda has one really cool animation.
05-08-2018T22:13:34,Vatruvius,Then sound effects.
05-08-2018T22:13:39,Vatruvius,Just subtle things.
05-08-2018T22:13:39,Bgrmystr2,you won't always have a panel worth animating on every page
05-08-2018T22:13:59,Bgrmystr2,"but every once in a while, you have that one that just.. it's exactly what it needs"
05-08-2018T22:14:01,Bgrmystr2,is motion
05-08-2018T22:14:17,Vatruvius,"Yeah, but as long as it keeps with all the other pages. Maybe no animation on a few or so but still ambient audio, etc."
05-08-2018T22:16:08,Bgrmystr2,"ya do it right, you'll get a lot of readers"
05-08-2018T22:16:23,Vatruvius,"A really good example that I can see in my head with my comic is a rainstom, there is a scene outside so the rain is animated and the sound is there, then the next page moves indoors so the rain is muffled and you only see some animation in like windows."
05-08-2018T22:17:28,Ordithus,"Yeah, that seems perfect"
05-08-2018T22:18:10,Bgrmystr2,yeah you'd need to make sure the transition from outside to inside is on separate pages
05-08-2018T22:18:21,Vatruvius,Exactly.
05-08-2018T22:18:28,Bgrmystr2,that's going to be rather difficult
05-08-2018T22:18:30,Vatruvius,But that is what I was thinking about.
05-08-2018T22:18:41,Bgrmystr2,"also, keep in mind you can have a door creak sound when they click the next page button"
05-08-2018T22:18:45,Ordithus,"Art isn't easy, bgr :ctwokinds-kingtea:"
05-08-2018T22:18:47,Bgrmystr2,"to ""go inside"""
05-08-2018T22:18:57,Ordithus,"Hell yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking"
05-08-2018T22:18:59,Vatruvius,Maybe...
05-08-2018T22:19:22,Vatruvius,Perhaps another scene could be like footsteps because the characters walk a ways...
05-08-2018T22:19:31,Vatruvius,For the next button.
05-08-2018T22:19:50,Bgrmystr2,"it's not really about art at that point Ord, it's about fitting the story on a set amount of panels in one page and making two things that are fairly close separate on two pages. It doesn't always mesh."
05-08-2018T22:20:21,Bgrmystr2,"yeh maybe vatru, or if there's a vehicle accident"
05-08-2018T22:20:29,Bgrmystr2,the audio effect would go into the next page too
05-08-2018T22:21:01,Bgrmystr2,"you'll wanna make sure you have a button w/ and w/o audio effects, cuz some ppl won't want audio"
05-08-2018T22:21:02,Vatruvius,"Yeah, fortunately I am not there yet. I am still working on a story and the characters. I am missing a lot of names and I need to keep practicing my art hand. I also have to mess around with this a bit and learn animation, etc."
05-08-2018T22:21:40,Vatruvius,But it is a neat idea and certainly something I can throw around a bit to see if it is what I would like to be unique about my comic beside the story and universe.
05-08-2018T22:22:20,Ordithus,"Keep at it, you have a creative mind to think of this"
05-08-2018T22:22:36,Vatruvius,I could make it so audio effects are turned on by default but you can click on an option to remove audio if the reader so wishes.
05-08-2018T22:23:53,Vatruvius,I wonder if some of the animations would make people motion sick though?
05-08-2018T22:24:11,Vatruvius,Perhaps I should also give an option to disable animations?
05-08-2018T22:24:13,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, not really"
05-08-2018T22:24:35,Bgrmystr2,"it really depends, but animation is not always going to trigger motion sickness"
05-08-2018T22:24:38,Ordithus,I think motion sickness is more peripheral
05-08-2018T22:25:29,Bgrmystr2,"the reason people get motion sickness is because their brain hasn't figured out that we are capable of moving while nothing around us moves, or vice versa"
05-08-2018T22:25:44,Vatruvius,Not necessarily Ord. My mom cannot look at any of my games. Her stomach immediately flips upside down.
05-08-2018T22:25:53,Bgrmystr2,"the brain thinks it took a neurotoxin, and you get sick"
05-08-2018T22:26:18,Bgrmystr2,"thus the brain trying to remove the toxin from your body.. and it's not a toxin, it's just.. yknow.. technology. Like riding in a car"
05-08-2018T22:26:19,Ordithus,"Yikes.  Well, I don't really suffer it myself so I guess it's something I don't really know"
05-08-2018T22:26:24,Bgrmystr2,"same, Ord"
05-08-2018T22:26:30,Bgrmystr2,but my mom gets it really bad
05-08-2018T22:27:01,Vatruvius,"I mean, it is not like it would be difficult for me to put in an option for no animations. My thought process for creating this animations is creating a finished page then animating the bits I like so I could technically have two pages."
05-08-2018T22:27:04,Bgrmystr2,"she can't go on merry go rounds, can't really look at fast moving gameplay, etc"
05-08-2018T22:27:14,Vatruvius,This would also solve the problem of prints and others stuff.
05-08-2018T22:27:16,Bgrmystr2,been like that all her life
05-08-2018T22:27:55,Bgrmystr2,but yeah you'll always have the page options where animations on/off and audio on/off
05-08-2018T22:28:05,Vatruvius,"Yeah, I do not get sick at all so...I am just taking what would be my entire reader base into consideration."
05-08-2018T22:28:28,Vatruvius,Animated dance club?
05-08-2018T22:28:32,Bgrmystr2,"unless your animation covers the entire screen, it won't likely be that big of a problem"
05-08-2018T22:28:50,Bgrmystr2,"cuz the brain will be able to see everything around the display, whether it be a monitor or phone, whatever"
05-08-2018T22:28:57,Vatruvius,Ture.
05-08-2018T22:29:01,Vatruvius,True*
05-08-2018T22:29:02,Ordithus,Something subtle like background movement in a panel probably wouldn't be a problem
05-08-2018T22:29:31,Vatruvius,"Yeah, I have no dance club in my comic at the moment but I could do like animated lights."
05-08-2018T22:29:47,Vatruvius,Maybe subtle changes in blacked out characters.
05-08-2018T22:30:56,Vatruvius,"I don't know, I just think all this is cool. If I can actually do all this I will be thoroughly satisfied with my comic."
05-08-2018T22:31:42,Vatruvius,"I would be satisfied anyway, but I would just be over the moon ecstatic if I can do this."
05-08-2018T22:31:56,Ordithus,You can do eeet
05-08-2018T22:32:05,Vatruvius,lol
05-08-2018T22:32:56,Vatruvius,This will take a while though. I really need to practice drawing and just getting my art style down and learning Ps.
05-08-2018T22:34:01,Vatruvius,"I would like to stream if I can, but I need to get a huge internet upgrade. But once I do, I will still be a ways away from actual pages so I think I will stream concept sketches/colors. Just learning the ropes type of stuff."
05-08-2018T22:34:17,Vatruvius,What you guys think about that?
05-08-2018T22:35:37,Ordithus,"Eh, if you like to do it as a hangout kind of thing."
05-08-2018T22:36:00,Vatruvius,"I mean, if I have the internet might as well."
05-08-2018T22:36:15,Vatruvius,"I like the community here so yeah, if I have the means I would like to."
05-08-2018T22:37:19,Ordithus,At least picarto doesn't really give folks of making it big streaming like twitch
05-08-2018T22:37:30,Ordithus,More casual than that
05-08-2018T22:37:41,Ordithus,*ideas of
05-08-2018T22:37:41,Vatruvius,"Yeah, that is why I like it."
05-08-2018T22:38:08,Vatruvius,It is really just hanging out with the artists and watch them draw. Talk to them even.
05-08-2018T22:38:13,Vatruvius,Listen to some good music.
05-08-2018T22:40:02,Vatruvius,"Well I have thoroughly exhausted my creativity for the day. I got a good half page or so of plot, which could be many pages, and ideas of animations and audio floating around my head."
05-08-2018T22:40:07,Vatruvius,Feeling good.

05-08-2018T22:45:37,Vatruvius,Slowly but surely I am getting there.
05-08-2018T23:15:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Werk
05-08-2018T23:16:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Some food for thought: Nibbly in a marshmallow costume for Halloween
05-08-2018T23:18:23,NightMeaty22,Hello everybody
05-08-2018T23:19:00,Ordithus,Hi
05-08-2018T23:19:10,NightMeaty22,How are you?
05-08-2018T23:19:25,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz: sleeeepy
05-08-2018T23:20:05,Ordithus,you?
05-08-2018T23:21:11,NightMeaty22,Mad at my dad but other than that i'm just sleepy
05-08-2018T23:24:55,NightMeaty22,He said that he would get me a laptop if i we finished one apartment but then he says that we have to do 6 more before he will order it
05-08-2018T23:25:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Find a way to get a different guardian. You‚Äôre dad‚Äôs shit
05-08-2018T23:26:44,NightMeaty22,And he also said that he would have to take some of the money that i earned to by it
05-08-2018T23:26:50,SpazztasticKiwi,*your
05-08-2018T23:27:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I repeat: shit
05-08-2018T23:28:04,NightMeaty22,And my brothers dont do jack shit so i'm doing all of the work and they are getting payed for it
05-08-2018T23:28:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"Your mom, either set of grandparents, aunts & uncles"
05-08-2018T23:28:55,NightMeaty22,Oh and i have 10 days to do all 6 apartments
05-08-2018T23:29:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Doesn‚Äôt matter - just find a guardian who‚Äôs a leader and not a boss
05-08-2018T23:29:51,NightMeaty22,Then i cook my self some pork chops and my dad asks if i cooked him some
05-08-2018T23:30:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I do wonder why you don‚Äôt tell a school counselor or someone similar all this instead of just us
05-08-2018T23:31:03,NightMeaty22,And he gets mad at me when i have to stop because i have a migraine
05-08-2018T23:32:03,NightMeaty22,School doesn't give a shit about some kid that has a crapy job
05-08-2018T23:32:07,SpazztasticKiwi,They could fix it or even help much better than us with more than just advice and suggestions
05-08-2018T23:32:55,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs a difference between working for the family business and building the family business
05-08-2018T23:33:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"If it‚Äôs a joint effort and everyone‚Äôs treated as per the guidelines applicable, it‚Äôs ok"
05-08-2018T23:34:00,NightMeaty22,Well it all works it self out eventually
05-08-2018T23:34:33,SpazztasticKiwi,But singling one out for all the work with less than what you often promise them as well as going back on promises is not
05-08-2018T23:34:38,NightMeaty22,I just need some people to talk to
05-08-2018T23:35:01,NightMeaty22,About whats going on
05-08-2018T23:35:09,NightMeaty22,In my life
05-08-2018T23:35:16,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs venting problems and then there‚Äôs revealing what amounts to low key abuse
05-08-2018T23:36:13,NightMeaty22,I get payed 10 an hour so its not all bax
05-08-2018T23:36:18,NightMeaty22,Bad*
05-08-2018T23:36:26,SpazztasticKiwi,And downplaying it because it‚Äôs all you know
05-08-2018T23:36:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"And again, you‚Äôve pointed out he takes back some if not most of that"
05-08-2018T23:37:34,NightMeaty22,About 60% goes to savings
05-08-2018T23:38:05,NightMeaty22,But i cant use any of it
05-08-2018T23:38:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"If it‚Äôs really a savings account for YOU, ok. That‚Äôs good"
05-08-2018T23:38:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"But if it‚Äôs for his own emergency funds or his funds at all, that‚Äôs not"
05-08-2018T23:39:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Just because you‚Äôre under 18 doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs entitled to everything you earn by your own hand
05-08-2018T23:41:13,NightMeaty22,I've been up since 3am i dont feel good my grandma died July 15th i just feel like crap
05-08-2018T23:41:55,NightMeaty22,Then the school screws up my schedule
05-08-2018T23:42:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"Sounds like you need bed, not talking"
05-08-2018T23:42:33,NightMeaty22,I just wanted a drawing class and they removed it
05-08-2018T23:42:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Know how your grandpa‚Äôs faring since her death? He would probably like for you to visit or call
05-08-2018T23:43:42,SpazztasticKiwi,We used to have a drawing and art option
05-08-2018T23:43:55,SpazztasticKiwi,They removed it for a parenting class
05-08-2018T23:44:24,NightMeaty22,I wish i could see him but i have to work
05-08-2018T23:45:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôd like to visit my only living grandpa too, but he‚Äôs in California"
05-08-2018T23:45:35,NightMeaty22,I hate the way Springville treats the students
05-08-2018T23:45:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Hopefully I can go sometime around SDCC or whatever
05-08-2018T23:46:21,NightMeaty22,But i cant even change it when i am in Ephraim
05-08-2018T23:46:47,NightMeaty22,Or see my grandpa
05-08-2018T23:46:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Oregon? Cause we have a Springville too
05-08-2018T23:47:06,NightMeaty22,Utah
05-08-2018T23:47:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Lots of Springvilles
05-08-2018T23:49:09,NightMeaty22,Sorry for complaining sometimes i just need to talk about my problems even if i dont know them
05-08-2018T23:49:24,NightMeaty22,The person i am talking to
05-08-2018T23:49:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"How old even are you, cause I know some places let younger than high school choose classes, but we couldn‚Äôt till 9th grade"
05-08-2018T23:50:03,NightMeaty22,15
05-08-2018T23:50:17,NightMeaty22,Yes i know i'm young
05-08-2018T23:50:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"It‚Äôs not complaining. If I‚Äôd said anything that I‚Äôd dealt with when I could‚Äôve, my situation would‚Äôve been better too"
05-08-2018T23:50:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Eh. 15‚Äôs not too young
05-08-2018T23:52:55,NightMeaty22,Some People just think i'm a lier
05-08-2018T23:52:58,Bgrmystr2,"How long have you been working for your dad, Night"
05-08-2018T23:53:05,NightMeaty22,Because i am 15
05-08-2018T23:53:06,SpazztasticKiwi,And there‚Äôs a place you can ramble anonymously if you‚Äôd rather than be here. It‚Äôs an app too so you can throw a thought out any time you need
05-08-2018T23:53:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Talklife. It‚Äôs useful for any time cause people all over the world use it - you‚Äôll never be without someone to listen
05-08-2018T23:54:18,NightMeaty22,I don't rember how long all i know is that i was when i was 8
05-08-2018T23:54:37,Bgrmystr2,"Then your dad has been breaking the law for a very long time, and probably still is. https://laborcommission.utah.gov/FAQ/child_labor.html"
05-08-2018T23:54:50,Bgrmystr2,that's illegal
05-08-2018T23:54:50,NightMeaty22,Lost most of my memory when i got hit by a truck
05-08-2018T23:55:13,Bgrmystr2,"The best thing for you to do, imo, is report it"
05-08-2018T23:55:25,Bgrmystr2,"report everything, everything he does, everything that happened that you remember"
05-08-2018T23:55:48,Bgrmystr2,"report all of it, cuz I guarentee you there's something that can be done"
05-08-2018T23:56:21,Bgrmystr2,You can't employ kids before the age of 14
05-08-2018T23:56:29,NightMeaty22,I dont want him going to jail because he isnt all bad
05-08-2018T23:57:03,Bgrmystr2,"maybe not, but this isn't about you, it's about how he's treating you"
05-08-2018T23:57:06,Bgrmystr2,and it's wrong
05-08-2018T23:57:08,NightMeaty22,Family apartments am i employed or not i dont know
05-08-2018T23:57:49,Bgrmystr2,"you don't need any documents to be employed, if you're doing something and being paid"
05-08-2018T23:57:55,Ordithus,"You are, and how you describe he treats you is not normal"
05-08-2018T23:58:37,NightMeaty22,Is there a normal thow
05-08-2018T23:58:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Uh yeah
05-08-2018T23:58:55,TheGamePlayer,"Ya I got a job offer at my local restaurant/bar, and I only need paperwork from school saying I can miss classes if called to work"
05-08-2018T23:59:23,Bgrmystr2,"Yes Night, yes there is, and you are not it."
05-08-2018T23:59:37,NightMeaty22,But when you think about normal doesn't exists
05-08-2018T23:59:51,Bgrmystr2,"You don't get to play that card, dude"
05-08-2018T23:59:53,Bgrmystr2,normal exists
05-08-2018T23:59:53,Ordithus,"Yeah it does, it's a town in Illinois"
05-08-2018T23:59:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"Like I said - a leader, not a boss. A leader helps and guides and provides appropriate compensation. A boss commands and gives little or nothing"
