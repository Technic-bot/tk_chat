25-09-2018T02:57:48,BadFoMo,Yo.
25-09-2018T03:00:31,Dadrobit,Pops came over to use my recording equipment. He's taking a week off and wanted to still give his students some decent classes to attend.
25-09-2018T03:01:23,Dadrobit,"Spent the last couple hours editing some lesson plans for him on reading, working off of, and creating blueprints."
25-09-2018T03:01:43,Dadrobit,Almost want to charge him for my time.... Almost....
25-09-2018T03:01:57,Bgrmystr2,but ya didn't? :u
25-09-2018T03:03:00,Dadrobit,Ehhhhh~
25-09-2018T03:03:52,Bgrmystr2,any reason?
25-09-2018T03:04:26,Bgrmystr2,"I probably would have if I were you, cuz you use that equipment for your job and stuff"
25-09-2018T03:04:38,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I dunno the specifics, but yknow"
25-09-2018T03:04:44,Dadrobit,He's spent damn near countless hours helping me whenever I need it? Also I'm renting one of his houses at a $100 a month discount already?
25-09-2018T03:05:08,Bgrmystr2,"yeah see, like I said I didn't know the specifics."
25-09-2018T03:06:03,Bgrmystr2,"Rent here is like $1500 a month for a pretty small house so.. $100 off isn't really much in my eyes, but I guess it's pretty different out there"
25-09-2018T03:07:39,Dadrobit,"One bed, One bath. $650 normally. I pay $550."
25-09-2018T03:08:02,Bgrmystr2,ah okay yeah
