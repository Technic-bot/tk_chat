04-05-2018T00:29:41,ZippyB,Thanks ive been watching the streams on youtube
04-05-2018T00:29:49,Vatruvius,Guess they are special.
04-05-2018T00:29:54,Vatruvius,D:
04-05-2018T00:29:55,Bgrmystr2,"that's also.. decently common-ish, Kopy"
04-05-2018T00:29:57,ZRO4825,"Yeah, Ord, I remember that one. Just wasn't sure if it'd been done with Sam & Colin yet."
04-05-2018T00:30:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Shadow time
04-05-2018T00:30:11,Ordithus,"Ah, OK.  No, I don't think so."
04-05-2018T00:30:19,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"half a dozen of one, six of the other, Bgr xD"
04-05-2018T00:30:36,Bgrmystr2,xD
04-05-2018T00:30:43,Bgrmystr2,"Definitely ""ish"" territory"
04-05-2018T00:30:45,CrRAR,Speaking of coffee Colin's fur pattern reminds me of the cappuccino art baristas do in the frothed milk.
04-05-2018T00:30:46,ZRO4825,"Sam has a mischievious look of sorts to her, so I can kinda see her gettin a semi-manic grin goin while she has Colin helpless and kicking. :P"
04-05-2018T00:31:09,Vatruvius,"What should I suggest for this Sunday? Maren and Trace or Nibbly, Sythe, and Raine?"
04-05-2018T00:31:18,ZRO4825,Maren: Yes.
04-05-2018T00:31:23,Ordithus,Maren &lt;3
04-05-2018T00:31:24,ZRO4825,Rest of them: Take your pick. :P
04-05-2018T00:31:49,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI‚Äôll take a Cappuccino Colin‚Äù
04-05-2018T00:31:49,ZRO4825,Maren and Nibbly. Nibbly has gone clothing diving because she freaked out because of dragons. Maren is in panic mode. Again. :P
04-05-2018T00:31:56,Vatruvius,"That is just two sketch suggestion, either Maren and Trace or Nibbly, Sythe, and Raine."
04-05-2018T00:32:05,CrRAR,haha kiwi
04-05-2018T00:32:13,Bgrmystr2,hmm
04-05-2018T00:32:30,CrRAR,Yeah the Maren x Trace throwback would probably be popular
04-05-2018T00:32:40,Bgrmystr2,that would probably get some votes
04-05-2018T00:32:48,Vatruvius,I figured.
04-05-2018T00:32:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Sam uses confusion. It seems to be effective
04-05-2018T00:33:05,CrRAR,"what's the Nibbly, Sythe, Raine idea?"
04-05-2018T00:33:09,Bgrmystr2,"depending on whether it's a ""now"" timetable or if it's a ""back when they were bf/gf"" timetable"
04-05-2018T00:33:13,ItsActuallyKopyKat,you mean. Sam uses Charm. It's super effective!
04-05-2018T00:33:14,Vatruvius,But should I hold off on that one for later in the month or just do it now?
04-05-2018T00:33:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Or is she more using a love spell
04-05-2018T00:33:21,ItsActuallyKopyKat,@Spazz
04-05-2018T00:33:35,Bgrmystr2,I'm more interested in Trace/Maren back when Trace was evilmcasshole
04-05-2018T00:33:42,Bgrmystr2,and how she dealt with it

04-05-2018T00:41:19,CrRAR,oh
04-05-2018T00:41:27,CrimsonHelsing,@Bgrmystr2 you sure? He claimed during chapter 18's progress that the *next* chapter would focus more on Trace. and it actually didn't ;P
04-05-2018T00:41:28,segaby,hmmmmmmm
04-05-2018T00:42:12,Vatruvius,"I think I will give Maren and Trace a go, see if it gets anywhere. If it just barely missed getting sketched I will go for it again. If not then I will wait until everyone is submitting Maren sketch suggestions when that part of chapter 20 gets drawn."
04-05-2018T00:42:18,Bgrmystr2,"It had a lot of trace though, Crimson"
04-05-2018T00:42:30,Bgrmystr2,and a lot of things change when planning
04-05-2018T00:42:34,CrimsonHelsing,"difference between a focus, and just screen time"
04-05-2018T00:43:01,Bgrmystr2,there's also a difference between a few pages ahead and an entire chapter ahead
04-05-2018T00:43:04,Whitestripes,"Dang, I didnt think the stream would still be going"
04-05-2018T00:43:08,Ordithus,"It'll be my top vote, Vatru"
04-05-2018T00:43:45,KaiserZephan,Twokinds prices for artwork
04-05-2018T00:44:15,Vatruvius,Should I throw a wrench into my Maren/Trace suggestion and have in the background smoke indicating the current genocide Trace has going on?
04-05-2018T00:44:17,segaby,this isnt google
04-05-2018T00:44:27,CrRAR,hehe
04-05-2018T00:44:32,segaby,you dont say something like that and a thing appears with the prices
04-05-2018T00:44:50,Bgrmystr2,xDD
04-05-2018T00:45:01,KaiserZephan,:ptv-confused:

04-05-2018T00:46:14,Vatruvius,For some reason that is really appealing to me.
04-05-2018T00:46:31,CrimsonHelsing,now you're making the two sound like Moxxi and Handsome Jack xD
04-05-2018T00:46:37,Vatruvius,"Of course, anyone not reading chat will not know this. It will not be in the vote section."
04-05-2018T00:46:39,CrimsonHelsing,... kinda.
04-05-2018T00:47:08,CrimsonHelsing,"and idk Vatruvius, we'll see"
04-05-2018T00:47:20,Vatruvius,"Non-chat readers: ""Aww...they are so cute...wait...why is Tom drawing smoke?"""
04-05-2018T00:47:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"So much chemistry, they started a fire"

04-05-2018T00:47:45,Vatruvius,lol
04-05-2018T00:47:59,segaby,probably involved hydrogen
04-05-2018T00:48:04,segaby,and lots of oxygen
04-05-2018T00:48:19,CrRAR,"""Oh- the smell of brimstone, how rooomantic~"""
04-05-2018T00:48:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Nah. Just lots of oxygen and friction
04-05-2018T00:48:28,segaby,ah
04-05-2018T00:48:29,segaby,ok
04-05-2018T00:48:30,CrimsonHelsing,or something to do with two androids I heard of &gt;.&gt;

04-05-2018T00:48:42,CrimsonHelsing,*ded*
04-05-2018T00:49:04,Vatruvius,Their love blinked into existence a fire on a unsuspecting town. Nothing like the smells and sounds of a burning village to make out to.
04-05-2018T00:49:25,Bgrmystr2,The chat made puns and something randomly lit on fire :V!
04-05-2018T00:49:28,segaby,definitely better than twilight
04-05-2018T00:49:39,segaby,*dead meme*
04-05-2018T00:49:41,Vatruvius,Anything beats twilight.
04-05-2018T00:49:51,segaby,what about toilet sporkle?
04-05-2018T00:49:57,Vatruvius,Literal shit beats twilight.
04-05-2018T00:50:03,segaby,yeah
04-05-2018T00:50:08,SpazztasticKiwi,If it wasn‚Äôt for the sad excuse of a romance in that book
04-05-2018T00:50:10,Bgrmystr2,"Noone? :( Damnit, I miss when Phoenix was here."
04-05-2018T00:50:14,Bgrmystr2,He'd have gotten that.
04-05-2018T00:50:19,segaby,heck
04-05-2018T00:50:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I liked Alice and Jasper though
04-05-2018T00:50:30,segaby,it is still a popular book in my state
04-05-2018T00:50:31,Vatruvius,I would rather spend my money on a movie watch animals shit than pay money and watch twilight.

04-05-2018T00:56:19,Vatruvius,"You never know, right now could be the middle of your life."
04-05-2018T00:56:25,Bgrmystr2,most people consider midlife like.. anywhere from 20 y/o to 40 y/o
04-05-2018T00:56:26,segaby,dont ruin me playing my saxaphone
04-05-2018T00:56:29,Bgrmystr2,too late

04-05-2018T00:57:50,segaby,lets see
04-05-2018T00:57:55,segaby,i play saxaphone
04-05-2018T00:57:57,segaby,i am 16
04-05-2018T00:58:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,cease
04-05-2018T00:58:15,segaby,i have driven 2 trains on a shortline and in the summer that number will go up
04-05-2018T00:58:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I now know all I need to know
04-05-2018T00:58:18,segaby,oh
04-05-2018T00:58:20,segaby,sorry
04-05-2018T00:58:40,segaby,all tell ya one more thing
04-05-2018T00:58:43,segaby,trains are my life
04-05-2018T00:58:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,from this info I now believe..........................
04-05-2018T00:58:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,you are not a squid or a duck
04-05-2018T00:59:03,Bgrmystr2,"I've got two pieces of advice for ya. If ya like it, don't stop. And if you can, learn to play by ear. Learn the notes of your sax, be able to match it just by hearing the note"
04-05-2018T00:59:18,Bgrmystr2,and you can potentially replicate songs you listen to without sheet music
04-05-2018T00:59:48,segaby,thanks
04-05-2018T00:59:54,Bgrmystr2,:thumbsup:
04-05-2018T00:59:56,segaby,and if everything goes right
04-05-2018T01:00:14,segaby,i will show you guys an animation that is in the making that will have a sone i wrote in it
04-05-2018T01:00:25,segaby,just gotta wait for the animation so i can time the song with it
04-05-2018T01:00:39,Bgrmystr2,"I should start playing again, myself."
04-05-2018T01:00:58,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
04-05-2018T01:00:59,segaby,"and i really hope that when i do it, my computer doesnt go out again"
04-05-2018T01:01:12,segaby,like lag into oblivion or the hard drive dying again
04-05-2018T01:01:16,segaby,i would lose my mind
04-05-2018T01:01:31,segaby,thats why i need new parts for her
04-05-2018T01:01:37,Vatruvius,"Okay, for the Maren/Trace suggestion should I specify it is pre-comic or do you think it will be a given from the nature of the suggestion?"
04-05-2018T01:01:39,segaby,9 years old and still going
04-05-2018T01:02:12,Bgrmystr2,"dunno, depends on how you write it vatru"
04-05-2018T01:02:24,Bgrmystr2,as long as it's not 7 paragraphs
04-05-2018T01:02:25,Bgrmystr2,:V
04-05-2018T01:02:35,segaby,‚Ä¢c‚Ä¢
04-05-2018T01:02:53,Bgrmystr2,"Bought my pc back in 2009, replaced a few things, but the Mobo and CPU are still goin"
04-05-2018T01:03:09,segaby,i got my pc free from my school
04-05-2018T01:03:16,Bgrmystr2,"eh, I built mine myself"
04-05-2018T01:03:25,Bgrmystr2,I wasn't in school at the time
04-05-2018T01:03:28,Vatruvius,It is three lines so far. The suggestion itself is one line and the aside notes are two lines.
04-05-2018T01:03:31,Bgrmystr2,By that time I was out of school
04-05-2018T01:03:39,segaby,it was supposed to be parted for a project (this was last year) but the project died
04-05-2018T01:03:49,segaby,so now i have a optiplex 380 that i own
04-05-2018T01:03:56,segaby,and it is smol
04-05-2018T01:04:43,Bgrmystr2,Not a fan of lil bitty towers myself. Too difficult to find the proper size components to fit
04-05-2018T01:04:45,Vatruvius,"My suggestion says Maren and Trace are out on a date, I think that is obviously pre-comic. I do not think I should have to specify that."
04-05-2018T01:05:00,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, you may want to"
04-05-2018T01:05:09,Vatruvius,Fine.
04-05-2018T01:05:31,Vatruvius,"I will just tag""Pre-Comic:"" in front of the suggestion."
04-05-2018T01:05:49,Bgrmystr2,you can say or Old Trace? :o
04-05-2018T01:05:52,Bgrmystr2,that may work too
04-05-2018T01:05:53,segaby,"well, it is the only alectronic i own"
04-05-2018T01:06:06,segaby,what i am using now the school owns
04-05-2018T01:06:09,Bgrmystr2,but yeah precomic works
04-05-2018T01:06:21,segaby,so i cant customize it (which sucks)
04-05-2018T01:06:43,Vatruvius,"I want to keep this suggestion short, so I am thinking of skipping the genocide thing for some cool magic stuff."
04-05-2018T01:06:49,Bgrmystr2,"do you have it at your house? Cuz if you do, you technically could.. and then take the parts out when you bring it back"
04-05-2018T01:06:50,Twokinds,BRB!
04-05-2018T01:06:52,segaby,"otherwise it would be runniong windows, not chrome oS"
04-05-2018T01:06:54,Bgrmystr2,"but if it's not at your house, then don't bother"
04-05-2018T01:07:10,segaby,"oh, its a chromebook"
04-05-2018T01:07:13,Bgrmystr2,mkay tom :o
04-05-2018T01:07:14,segaby,it is not a tower
04-05-2018T01:07:19,segaby,but my optiplex i own
04-05-2018T01:07:23,segaby,and its at my house
04-05-2018T01:07:47,Vatruvius,"Okay, magic or genocide? I am really leaning on magic, it would be really cool."
04-05-2018T01:08:02,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: I don't know..?

04-05-2018T01:08:52,Vatruvius,"At this point I doubt my suggestion would ever be cannon. No way, Trace too nice. Or we really do not know him that well."

04-05-2018T01:11:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a feeling Tom can be a 100% sap
04-05-2018T01:11:46,SageSaga,Zro
04-05-2018T01:11:48,Bgrmystr2,maybe he wants to show trace being super evil or somethin

04-05-2018T01:11:58,RyuTech,i wish real humans would look that smooth and soft
04-05-2018T01:12:11,Bgrmystr2,"They do though, usually"
04-05-2018T01:12:14,Vatruvius,"Maybe, but I am leaning on the sappy magic and it is a sketch, not cannon."

04-05-2018T01:35:55,SageSaga,i think its pretty close to the same thing- if your gonna let kids on the internet- by themselves - unattended- they should already know what sex is

04-05-2018T01:50:48,Vatruvius,Once I get to that point though Sage and make you your girlfriend/wife I am pretty sure I will have to relocate you to a secure bunker/spot of land I own. You might get burned at the stake with your very pricey to make girlfriend/wife.

04-05-2018T01:52:16,ZRO4825,"But if you go to Sage's channel, it counts as more viewers for him, plus, fullscreen!"
04-05-2018T01:52:21,CrimsonHelsing,no I didn't typo xD
04-05-2018T01:52:30,Grishmark,good night everyone
04-05-2018T01:52:41,Bgrmystr2,"I can fullscreen without doing so, and it counts the viewers even if you're not on his page"

04-05-2018T01:52:57,AttackCats,switches over anyway
04-05-2018T01:52:57,Vatruvius,I have migrated.
04-05-2018T01:53:21,ZRO4825,"You sure 'bout that? Because if it did, then it should have the same number of viewers between Sage and Tom while they're both streaming. Yet Tom always has more viewers."
04-05-2018T01:53:33,Bgrmystr2,Because mobile
04-05-2018T01:53:38,CrimsonHelsing,"eh, I got a busy day tomorrow, work and then the supermarket immediately after that"
04-05-2018T01:53:48,Bgrmystr2,"and cuz you can fullscreen the stream and remove all the others, zro"
04-05-2018T01:53:50,Vatruvius,"Once the stream was over, since I had Tom's stream full screened, I could switch to Sage's. I had to migrate."
04-05-2018T01:53:51,Bgrmystr2,and they stop playing
04-05-2018T01:54:25,Bgrmystr2,"you can vatru, if you right click and click play"
04-05-2018T01:54:37,Bgrmystr2,"it tries to play, and brings up the player options"
04-05-2018T01:54:53,Vatruvius,I will try that next time.
04-05-2018T01:54:54,Bgrmystr2,and you can make the window smaller and go from there
04-05-2018T01:54:55,Bgrmystr2,:)
04-05-2018T01:55:48,Vatruvius,All I need to do is cover up that...distracting thing on the left and all will be good! He he.... :ptv-uneasy:
04-05-2018T01:55:58,ItsActuallyKopyKat,distracting lol
04-05-2018T01:56:25,SageSaga,:csagesaga-bounce:
04-05-2018T01:56:37,Bgrmystr2,"xD if that's distracting ya, there's much improvement to be  made"

04-05-2018T01:56:38,Vatruvius,Now it is on the right of my screen too!
04-05-2018T01:56:38,ZRO4825,One of the best distractions ever.
04-05-2018T01:56:43,Bgrmystr2,cuz it's not distracting to me
04-05-2018T01:56:47,ZRO4825,"Speaking of distractions, wonder where Maty is. :thinking:"
04-05-2018T01:57:04,Bgrmystr2,"speaking of distractions, brb"
04-05-2018T01:57:04,w0lfmare,That gif is a bit much for me XD
04-05-2018T01:57:12,Vatruvius,"I will be honest, not really distracting. Just not my thing is all."
04-05-2018T01:57:24,ZRO4825,"I've seen some that are so MUCH more than that, that one's pretty mild to me in all honesty. :joy:"
04-05-2018T01:57:26,Vatruvius,With ya there w0lf
04-05-2018T01:57:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Can‚Äôt be distracted if you‚Äôre desynthesized
04-05-2018T01:57:32,SageSaga,it was a gift
04-05-2018T01:57:39,ZRO4825,Desensitized*
04-05-2018T01:58:02,ZRO4825,synthesizing is entirely different. :P
04-05-2018T01:58:08,Vatruvius,Not sure if I want to get that desensitized. :thinking:
04-05-2018T01:58:22,Vatruvius,How does that work Kiwi?
04-05-2018T01:58:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Have them
04-05-2018T01:58:39,Twokinds,desanfransized
04-05-2018T01:58:43,Vatruvius,Ah...yes...something I cannot do.
04-05-2018T01:58:47,Vatruvius,What!?
04-05-2018T01:58:54,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs quitter talk
04-05-2018T01:59:08,ZRO4825,"When you've managed to move out of San Francisco, Tom? :V"
04-05-2018T01:59:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Everyone can have boobs
04-05-2018T01:59:22,SpazztasticKiwi,When was he in San Francisco?
04-05-2018T01:59:27,Vatruvius,But do I want to have boobs?
04-05-2018T01:59:32,Twokinds,Have you seen the prices over there? NEVER
04-05-2018T01:59:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Kiwi, can I has de bobs"
04-05-2018T01:59:44,Vatruvius,You say that as my sister lives there.
04-05-2018T01:59:50,SpazztasticKiwi,If you grow em yourself
04-05-2018T02:00:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Or get a girlfriend. You‚Äôll technically have boobs then
04-05-2018T02:00:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'll need a lab and a team then
04-05-2018T02:00:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Or a plastic surgeon
04-05-2018T02:00:30,w0lfmare,Can't take the physics :cw0lfmare-EmberShock:
04-05-2018T02:00:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,that cost money
04-05-2018T02:00:46,Vatruvius,"Like, I think I will be 100% satisfied if what happened to Mike happened to me if it got to that level of desire. So far on the desire scale, very low. More of an interesting thought."
04-05-2018T02:01:01,SpazztasticKiwi,You asked how to get them. There was no stated restrictions
04-05-2018T02:01:15,SpazztasticKiwi,#waitamonth Vat
04-05-2018T02:01:18,Vatruvius,Ah...a physics oriented person. You are not alone w0lf.
04-05-2018T02:01:46,Vatruvius,What? One month and Nora will cast a day illusion on me?
04-05-2018T02:01:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Sweet innocent child
04-05-2018T02:02:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Never mind
04-05-2018T02:02:24,Vatruvius,I am missing so much. :ptv-wondering:
04-05-2018T02:02:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you got changed into a girl like Mike, would you still like it after a month?"
04-05-2018T02:03:15,Vatruvius,After a month?
04-05-2018T02:03:18,Vatruvius,Hmm...
04-05-2018T02:03:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"Or would you rather have a one day experience thing, cause personally I‚Äôd have a lot of fun being a guy for a day"
04-05-2018T02:04:03,Vatruvius,"What, like what it is like to go to the bathroom and have no lines?"
04-05-2018T02:04:21,SpazztasticKiwi,And maybe being taller
04-05-2018T02:04:40,ZRO4825,"I've always said, if Ranma's Spring of Drowned Girl existed and I got splashed, I'd probably be pretty unconcerned, lol."
04-05-2018T02:05:17,Vatruvius,"Maybe taller, but increased speed in the bathroom is paired with increased...mess in the bathroom. Airports are the only bathrooms I am impressed by how clean they are."
04-05-2018T02:05:39,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"yeah what is it like, not having gaggles of girls in your bathrooms?"
04-05-2018T02:05:55,SageSaga,wet
04-05-2018T02:05:55,Vatruvius,I think one day would be good enough Kiwi. Avoiding people I know for a day would be easier than a month.
04-05-2018T02:05:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you didn‚Äôt overestimate you‚Äôre distance, there wouldn‚Äôt be a mess"
04-05-2018T02:06:08,SpazztasticKiwi,*your
04-05-2018T02:06:20,Vatruvius,"I do not make a mess Kiwi, many others do."
04-05-2018T02:06:21,SageSaga,mens bathrooms are always wet- we hope its not urine- but it's probably urin
04-05-2018T02:06:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Thanks for the mental image
04-05-2018T02:06:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Both of you
04-05-2018T02:06:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I have seen a men‚Äôs room before though
04-05-2018T02:06:55,SageSaga,just being honest
04-05-2018T02:07:05,Vatruvius,Do not where sandles if you are going to use a public restroom at some point.
04-05-2018T02:07:14,w0lfmare,Gross and true
04-05-2018T02:07:17,Vatruvius,sandals*
04-05-2018T02:07:35,w0lfmare,Best to avoid public bathrooms entirely
04-05-2018T02:07:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Remind me not to follow a guy into the bathroom then
04-05-2018T02:07:47,Vatruvius,"Yeah, just don't."
04-05-2018T02:07:49,Dadrobit,Blah. Was supposed to sleep. Got nap instead.
04-05-2018T02:07:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,wb Daddy
04-05-2018T02:07:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Ladies rooms can be an experience too
04-05-2018T02:08:10,Vatruvius,"Sure, it makes going to the bathroom fast and easy, but most guys make it a con in the bathroom."
04-05-2018T02:08:30,Dadrobit,It's not like guys don't know how to aim (granted there are a few). Most of it is just splashback tbh.
04-05-2018T02:08:45,Bgrmystr2,Back
04-05-2018T02:08:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Like hearing the loud af packaging of a pad in the next stall
04-05-2018T02:08:52,Bgrmystr2,and aww I missed the sanfran jokes :(
04-05-2018T02:08:57,Vatruvius,It is all about aim. I have master picking the best spot to aim for minimal to no splash back.
04-05-2018T02:09:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Uhhh good to know?
04-05-2018T02:09:22,Bgrmystr2,"I just kinda sit down, no muss no fuss"
04-05-2018T02:09:24,Bgrmystr2,and no mess :V
04-05-2018T02:09:27,Bgrmystr2,and no wet.
04-05-2018T02:09:28,Dadrobit,I am a font of knowledge.
04-05-2018T02:11:37,ZRO4825,"^ can attest, did a cleaning job for a while."
04-05-2018T02:11:41,Vatruvius,Really?
04-05-2018T02:11:47,Vatruvius,:thinking:
04-05-2018T02:11:47,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's what I hear too
04-05-2018T02:11:53,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs inconsiderate people on both sides
04-05-2018T02:11:56,Bgrmystr2,"from a LOT of sources, many of them janitors"
04-05-2018T02:12:05,Bgrmystr2,including someone I live with..
04-05-2018T02:12:17,Dadrobit,"Yeah, heard that as well."
04-05-2018T02:12:18,SageSaga,simple thing to consider- women do more stuff in the bathroom- cleaning up makeup on mirrors and in sinks is a pain
04-05-2018T02:12:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Some ladies can‚Äôt clean up their wrappers. I know that as a fact
04-05-2018T02:12:37,Mihari,And changing kids :P
04-05-2018T02:12:43,SpazztasticKiwi,That too
04-05-2018T02:12:46,SageSaga,we didnt have a changing place for kids
04-05-2018T02:12:56,SageSaga,so i cant say anything on that
04-05-2018T02:13:00,Mihari,"t's not a constant, just something that happens sometimes."
04-05-2018T02:13:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I once walked into a bathroom and some lady had left a dirty diaper on the changing table
04-05-2018T02:13:35,ZRO4825,Niiiiice ~.~
04-05-2018T02:13:37,SpazztasticKiwi,With a garbage can right there
04-05-2018T02:13:52,SageSaga,garbage cans in womens rooms fill up faster too
04-05-2018T02:13:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Yep
04-05-2018T02:14:14,Bgrmystr2,and this is why I don't use public bathrooms
04-05-2018T02:14:16,SageSaga,and when it is full- they dont tell you- they just put it on top
04-05-2018T02:14:18,Bgrmystr2,"all of that, right there."
04-05-2018T02:14:24,Vatruvius,"To be frank, having only been a guy I can say what I look forward to the most about being a guy, but the bathroom is not on top of the list."
04-05-2018T02:14:50,Vatruvius,I can't*
04-05-2018T02:15:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Guys say they‚Äôd play with their new boobs if they became a girl. Girls would do...similar things
04-05-2018T02:15:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Trust me
04-05-2018T02:15:29,Vatruvius,Ohh...that is a lovely thought. :ptv-grossedout:
04-05-2018T02:15:30,Bgrmystr2,"That's curiosity of the unknown, really"
04-05-2018T02:15:44,Bgrmystr2,pretty standard.
04-05-2018T02:16:07,ZRO4825,"I've always told my mom, if someone turns me into a chick, first thing I'm doing is lookin at'em, and going ""Well then....time to figure out how bras work, I guess."" :joy:"
04-05-2018T02:16:08,SpazztasticKiwi,And we don‚Äôt have to shave then either. Heaven
04-05-2018T02:16:16,Vatruvius,"Would agree that is just curiosity, but I did not need that picture in my head."
04-05-2018T02:16:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Bras are a pain
04-05-2018T02:16:33,Vatruvius,lol
04-05-2018T02:16:36,ZRO4825,I have an amazing capability to handle odd situations with a sense of humor.
04-05-2018T02:16:46,Bgrmystr2,"lol zro, there's some out there with clips"
04-05-2018T02:16:57,ZRO4825,It's the day-to-day aggravations that tend to make me frazzled. :rofl:
04-05-2018T02:17:04,Dadrobit,There was a moment like that in the new Jumanji movie with Jack Black. Laughed my goddamned ass off.
04-05-2018T02:17:06,Bgrmystr2,pretty easy to just snap together
04-05-2018T02:17:16,Vatruvius,He was great in that movie.
04-05-2018T02:17:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,same dad
04-05-2018T02:17:18,Bgrmystr2,most are difficult on purpose :/
04-05-2018T02:17:23,w0lfmare,Life gives you lemons? ... Cheat
04-05-2018T02:17:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don‚Äôt have to shave, no more bras, and I can pee standing up - let the fun begin"
04-05-2018T02:18:14,Bgrmystr2,&gt;Life gives you lemons .. &gt;Transform lemons into $100 bills each.
04-05-2018T02:18:29,Bgrmystr2,that's whatcha do
04-05-2018T02:18:47,Bgrmystr2,or bars of gold :thinking: but yknow
04-05-2018T02:18:53,Bgrmystr2,that may be difficult to explain
04-05-2018T02:20:34,Vatruvius,My head is just swimming with all these thoughts now...:ptv-nope:
04-05-2018T02:23:04,Vatruvius,"I am getting pretty stream tired. I think I am going to head off and read something. Bye Sage, Tom, Mihari, and everyone else!"

04-05-2018T02:34:50,ZRO4825,At least not at normal times. :P
04-05-2018T02:35:10,Bgrmystr2,"ooo, more NPCs, sage"
04-05-2018T02:35:13,ZRO4825,"It's like saying I don't sleep. Much to my dissatisfaction, it's simply not true. D:"

04-05-2018T02:41:01,w0lfmare,Books are expensive
04-05-2018T02:41:16,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"when you're trying to type gg at the end of a match, fail, and type ""G"""

04-05-2018T02:42:23,PhilTheIdle,Did I miss something? Wolf made a book?
04-05-2018T02:42:39,Bgrmystr2,yeh he's releasing books for his webcomic
04-05-2018T02:43:03,PhilTheIdle,Ok
04-05-2018T02:43:15,w0lfmare,Yeah that
04-05-2018T02:43:18,PhilTheIdle,Some questions:
04-05-2018T02:43:23,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"but books are expensive lol... all the trees, ink, etc"
04-05-2018T02:43:43,PhilTheIdle,1. What's Wolfs comic about?
04-05-2018T02:43:50,PhilTheIdle,2. Whats AI about?
04-05-2018T02:44:06,PhilTheIdle,3. Whats Yosh about?

04-05-2018T02:44:15,Bgrmystr2,stuff!
04-05-2018T02:44:19,Bgrmystr2,lots of stuff.
04-05-2018T02:44:27,w0lfmare,Permission to link the 3 comics Sage?
04-05-2018T02:44:41,SageSaga,sure
04-05-2018T02:45:20,w0lfmare,"My comic, Bloodline http://w0lfmare.xepher.net/"
04-05-2018T02:45:37,w0lfmare,AI: http://ai.katbox.net/
04-05-2018T02:45:47,w0lfmare,And Yosh http://yosh.katbox.net/
04-05-2018T02:46:26,PhilTheIdle,Thanks. I'm asking because I don't want to start reading/watching someting without knowing I would like it because I always want to finish it and if I could tink the story might be bad I don't want to waste a few hours for that.
04-05-2018T02:46:54,PhilTheIdle,Could take more than just a FEW hours.
04-05-2018T02:46:57,Bgrmystr2,that's kind of the point of reading something and seeing if you do like it.
04-05-2018T02:47:04,SageSaga,Yosh is the story of an alternate Earth with a resurgence of Magic from a forgotten past - its also over 2000 pages so if you are worried about wasting time- then you should probably not read it
04-05-2018T02:47:17,Bgrmystr2,"you can't know if you like something before you read it.. ya haven't read it yet, silly xD"
04-05-2018T02:47:32,Dadrobit,Bloodline is about a hydrophibic doggo trying to overcome her eye condition.
04-05-2018T02:47:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
04-05-2018T02:47:46,Bgrmystr2,Hydrophobic* ?
04-05-2018T02:47:47,SageSaga,Artificial Incident is about a person who ends up trapped in a video game world with their memories being overwritten by their characters past.
04-05-2018T02:48:00,Dadrobit,"Yeah, bgr's got it."
04-05-2018T02:48:48,w0lfmare,"My comic is about a girl and her journey to break free from her demonic heritage, against the wishes of her father, and other demon bloodlines"
04-05-2018T02:49:01,Bgrmystr2,"damn, w0lf's got that description down"
04-05-2018T02:49:02,w0lfmare,Robit XD
04-05-2018T02:49:07,Dadrobit,That's another way to look at it lol.
04-05-2018T02:49:10,Bgrmystr2,nicely written
04-05-2018T02:49:43,PhilTheIdle,"If it's about 2 unicorns who just dance around I'd like it less than killing, fucking and intigueing aka GoT(please, NO SPOILERS)."
04-05-2018T02:50:02,SageSaga,AI is currently on Chapter 4 (There is also a Prologue Chapter so 4 are done 5 is being worked on) and each Chapter is 26 pages
04-05-2018T02:50:28,PhilTheIdle,"But all of yours soud interesting, I guess I'll take some time for your comics."
04-05-2018T02:50:33,PhilTheIdle,sound
04-05-2018T02:50:33,Bgrmystr2,I can attest that AI and Bloodline are both pretty good. I enjoyed em
04-05-2018T02:50:40,Bgrmystr2,"I haven't read Yosh yet, but I don't expect it to be bad"
04-05-2018T02:50:52,SageSaga,hahahAHAHAHA!
04-05-2018T02:50:59,PhilTheIdle,"So, no dancing unicorns?"
04-05-2018T02:51:00,Bgrmystr2,Shhhhutup sage
04-05-2018T02:51:09,Bgrmystr2,you're not supposed to shoot yourself in the foot!
04-05-2018T02:51:17,w0lfmare,XD
04-05-2018T02:51:22,SageSaga,not yet- but when the Unicorns show up in AI things are gonna get bad- Unicorns are dicks
04-05-2018T02:51:34,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock:
04-05-2018T02:51:56,PhilTheIdle,They are. But The Last Unicorn was just wonderful when I was a child.
04-05-2018T02:51:56,RedDragonSyndicate,Howdy
04-05-2018T02:51:58,SageSaga,they only let Virgin women ride them- and some of the stories say they take them away and eat them

04-05-2018T02:52:21,Bgrmystr2,and why does that sound familiar..?
04-05-2018T02:52:27,SageSaga,because its true?
04-05-2018T02:52:42,Bgrmystr2,Did you talk about that before?
04-05-2018T02:52:50,Bgrmystr2,or is it a reference to somethin?
04-05-2018T02:52:51,w0lfmare,I read a bunch of Yosh a long time ago. Don't think it was bad
04-05-2018T02:52:57,ZRO4825,Heyyo Red
04-05-2018T02:53:04,Bgrmystr2,"see, there ya go, w0lf's got it"

04-05-2018T02:53:13,SageSaga,it's legit Unicorn lore bro
04-05-2018T02:53:22,w0lfmare,"The story was interesting, but I think the early stuff had some pacing problems"
04-05-2018T02:53:44,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, for actual unicorns, sage? The legend of them? Not the comic?"
04-05-2018T02:53:44,Mihari,"Haven't you ever heard, you are what you eat? Gotta stay pure..."
04-05-2018T02:53:52,w0lfmare,"The ""good stuff"" felt too spread out"
04-05-2018T02:54:03,SageSaga,actual unicorn legends
04-05-2018T02:54:16,w0lfmare,"Oops, I'm going into critique mode"

04-05-2018T02:54:27,Bgrmystr2,I did not know that
04-05-2018T02:54:44,Bgrmystr2,"I knew they had a horn on their head, they were rare, and that.. was about it."
04-05-2018T02:55:01,PhilTheIdle,And girls like them.
04-05-2018T02:55:09,Bgrmystr2,yeah but that's not lore-specific XD

04-05-2018T03:36:18,PhilTheIdle,"Hi, Jeremy"
04-05-2018T03:36:32,Twokinds,They're bound to come out with an updated model soon.
04-05-2018T03:36:40,SageSaga,yeah but its a huge upgrade from what i got-
04-05-2018T03:36:41,RedDragonSyndicate,I didn't realize the mobile studios were so pricey
04-05-2018T03:36:53,SageSaga,its a full tablet PC
04-05-2018T03:37:04,RedDragonSyndicate,I -can- recommend the Surface Pro 4 - that I have and works awesome
04-05-2018T03:37:06,SageSaga,and its 4k
04-05-2018T03:37:12,JeremySenpai,"Hi everyone, thanks for greetings"
04-05-2018T03:37:14,RedDragonSyndicate,and it's cheaper now
04-05-2018T03:37:15,SageSaga,used a Surface Pro 4
04-05-2018T03:37:25,SageSaga,not good enough
04-05-2018T03:37:37,Twokinds,"I have a Surface Pro. I'm not a fan of how they feel, honestly."
04-05-2018T03:37:56,RedDragonSyndicate,Well really I only use mine when I'm traveling &gt;.&gt;
04-05-2018T03:38:02,PhilTheIdle,"Sage is mucking around with us, he saves money to get Huion 420."
04-05-2018T03:38:03,SageSaga,i owned a pro4 - i returned it
04-05-2018T03:38:05,Bgrmystr2,aaa senpai joined the stream

04-05-2018T03:38:33,ItsActuallyKopyKat,ripper
04-05-2018T03:38:50,RedDragonSyndicate,"I've liked my Pro 4 - I use it to sketch primarily though. Most my ""serious"" finished work is done on my 13HD"
04-05-2018T03:39:19,SageSaga,i have a Cintiq Companion and a 13HD
04-05-2018T03:39:43,PhilTheIdle,I have nothing :(
04-05-2018T03:40:16,SageSaga,what i want was a merge of the Companion and the 13HD - a bit bigger- and a higher res
04-05-2018T03:40:17,JeremySenpai,:cjeremysenpai-headpat: Rip phil
04-05-2018T03:40:26,SageSaga,aka - The Mobile Studio Pro XD
04-05-2018T03:40:36,RedDragonSyndicate,ha ha
04-05-2018T03:41:27,RedDragonSyndicate,The Mobile studio looks beautiful. I just....woof. 3k man
04-05-2018T03:41:51,Bgrmystr2,"back... ish. Not really. Also, yeah I said Stream time, meaning Sage's time, cuz sage is streaming, not me. And he's Eastern."
04-05-2018T03:41:55,Bgrmystr2,@Kopy
04-05-2018T03:41:55,SageSaga,i would get the i5 version
04-05-2018T03:42:13,SageSaga,2400
04-05-2018T03:42:30,ItsActuallyKopyKat,oohhhhh
04-05-2018T03:42:34,ItsActuallyKopyKat,I see now
04-05-2018T03:42:35,SageSaga,see if it couldnt be connected to my PC and used as a normal tablet i would go with the i7
04-05-2018T03:42:38,ItsActuallyKopyKat,danke danke
04-05-2018T03:42:48,SageSaga,but it does connect so the i5 would be fine
04-05-2018T03:42:52,RedDragonSyndicate,I'd find it worth it once I discovered what the internal GPU was based on
04-05-2018T03:43:06,PhilTheIdle,"Kopy, du sprichst deutsch?"
04-05-2018T03:43:17,PhilTheIdle,aka you speak german?

04-05-2018T03:43:44,PhilTheIdle,You are Toms father.
04-05-2018T03:43:46,SageSaga,i5 would be fine too
04-05-2018T03:44:03,ItsActuallyKopyKat,....that's be interesting. I'd have to be a male first.
04-05-2018T03:44:54,PhilTheIdle,You're just pretending. Just as you tell us you're dead. I catched you.

04-05-2018T03:49:29,RedDragonSyndicate,Ohhh true - that parallax is nonsense
04-05-2018T03:49:34,Bgrmystr2,Clearly they have connections with the Green Lanturns.

04-05-2018T04:09:33,TheBeckoner,They always seem to put me in weird/ difficult situations

04-05-2018T04:10:39,DarthRexKing,"Oh boy. I am going to bed before I hear anymore of this whining. Take my advice as I am a student as well. Prepare in advance, have goals laid out, take proper notes."
04-05-2018T04:10:46,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Ha! Called it!
04-05-2018T04:10:53,DarthRexKing,"Unfortunately saga, that concept may be beyond him."

04-05-2018T04:13:31,RedDragonSyndicate,"I'll be heading out myself. Happy to catch a stream, Sage. See ya'll around. Hope you all have a great weekend"

04-05-2018T04:14:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,think me Zro

04-05-2018T04:14:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:)
04-05-2018T04:14:42,Bgrmystr2,but I have seen him say things that are purposely mean
04-05-2018T04:14:46,PhilTheIdle,If you act like a cat you are still human
04-05-2018T04:14:49,ItsActuallyKopyKat,It's hard to tell the intonation of text on a screen
04-05-2018T04:15:02,ZRO4825,"Kiiiiiinda hard to read it wrong when he comments about whining and then says ""that concept's probably beyond him"""

04-05-2018T04:24:49,Bgrmystr2,I recall there was one where w/ the scene of the muscle car and the train
04-05-2018T04:24:54,Bgrmystr2,and like.. I don't recall
04-05-2018T04:25:01,Bgrmystr2,and there was a lot of driving on dirt
04-05-2018T04:25:06,Bgrmystr2,I don't know which one it was
04-05-2018T04:25:22,Bgrmystr2,I don't even know if it was a F&F movie
04-05-2018T04:25:22,Bgrmystr2,XD
04-05-2018T04:25:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,fast 5 i think
04-05-2018T04:25:40,Bgrmystr2,"the muscle car was jet black though,"
04-05-2018T04:25:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,most of Dom's cars are
04-05-2018T04:26:20,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
04-05-2018T04:26:29,Bgrmystr2,it was the car he didn't drivecuz it scared him or something
04-05-2018T04:26:36,Bgrmystr2,and he finally drove it
04-05-2018T04:26:48,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, I don't recall too much XD"
04-05-2018T04:26:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,His dad's charger
04-05-2018T04:27:12,Bgrmystr2,ahh was it that? Wow my text is not actually typing at the same speed I am..

04-05-2018T04:29:24,ZRO4825,"Sounds more like Bgr's talkin 'bout the first movie, lol"
04-05-2018T04:29:38,Bgrmystr2,you guys would know more than I haha
04-05-2018T04:29:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,they bring the charger back in fast 5
04-05-2018T04:29:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,and again in fast 7
04-05-2018T04:30:17,Bgrmystr2,I could have possibly watched multiple movies and not remember
04-05-2018T04:30:22,Bgrmystr2,so I dunno!
04-05-2018T04:30:24,Bgrmystr2,xD
04-05-2018T04:31:00,Bgrmystr2,I remember it was the same actor and that same black muscle car w/ the engine stickin out the front hood
04-05-2018T04:31:17,Bgrmystr2,and the train scene
04-05-2018T04:31:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Thats the charger
04-05-2018T04:31:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,first movie
04-05-2018T04:31:28,Bgrmystr2,"prettymuch the only thing I remember, but I can clearly remember it"
04-05-2018T04:31:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,the race against the charger and the supra
04-05-2018T04:33:19,Bgrmystr2,"yeh looked it up, youtube says first movie"
04-05-2018T04:34:30,Bgrmystr2,don't think I saw 5
04-05-2018T04:34:57,Bgrmystr2,Which one is Tokyo Drift? Does it have a specific hidden number attached to it?
04-05-2018T04:35:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,3
04-05-2018T04:35:04,Bgrmystr2,okay
04-05-2018T04:35:11,Bgrmystr2,I might have seen 2 as well then..

04-05-2018T04:35:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,\o/
04-05-2018T04:35:44,Bgrmystr2,"it's just conjecture really, but it's possible"

04-05-2018T04:36:04,SageSaga,oh jeez

04-05-2018T04:36:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,almost w0lfy hours
04-05-2018T04:36:32,Bgrmystr2,"oh wait, was F&F 2 the one where like 200 cars come out of that warehouse with the helicopters everywhere?"

04-05-2018T04:37:26,Bgrmystr2,okay

04-05-2018T04:37:34,Bgrmystr2,though I don't remember much of em
04-05-2018T04:37:35,SageSaga,how much does w0lf get done in a stream?
04-05-2018T04:37:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,not much but enough
04-05-2018T04:37:51,OniRayoh1991,"I'm feeling tired myself. Enjoy the rest of your time, folks. :&gt;"
04-05-2018T04:37:53,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, I wouldn't think as much as you do, Sage"
04-05-2018T04:37:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Oni
04-05-2018T04:38:00,Bgrmystr2,but he does pretty good for himself

04-05-2018T04:38:34,Bgrmystr2,yeah
04-05-2018T04:38:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,same
04-05-2018T04:39:11,Bgrmystr2,"From what I've seen, his speed seems like his biggest issue"
04-05-2018T04:39:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"again, smae"
04-05-2018T04:39:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,same

04-05-2018T04:39:42,Bgrmystr2,"well yeah but I mean, his quality will improve over time"
04-05-2018T04:39:54,Bgrmystr2,with the art and body shapes and stuff
04-05-2018T04:40:04,PhilTheIdle,It's almost lunchtime. See you around.

04-05-2018T04:40:42,Bgrmystr2,and then there were two phils again.
04-05-2018T04:40:45,SageSaga,"i want to help w0lf but im betting soon as i try its gonna be ""oh that's my style"" alllll over again"
04-05-2018T04:41:14,Bgrmystr2,yeah that seems like a hole from what I've read / been told
04-05-2018T04:41:38,SageSaga,"a lot of people fall into that- using ""style"" as an excuse"
04-05-2018T04:41:38,Bgrmystr2,"if you stick to one style before gaining speed, it kinda stunts your growth"
04-05-2018T04:42:55,SageSaga,and i like w0lf - but im worried if i try its gonna go bad
04-05-2018T04:43:12,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
04-05-2018T04:43:30,SageSaga,"i was worried way back when i had to be like ""Tom- your characters heads are messed up"""
04-05-2018T04:44:11,ZRO4825,It's a fair fear. Some people just do NOT take critique/advice well.
04-05-2018T04:44:12,SageSaga,"and thankfully he was like ""Oh? Show me"" and i did- and well- you can all see the results"
04-05-2018T04:44:20,ZRO4825,Seen it in Final Fantasy online games WAY too many times...
04-05-2018T04:44:29,Bgrmystr2,yeah tom improved cuz of it
04-05-2018T04:44:40,SageSaga,"but others- ""That's just how I DRAW!"" or ""OH that's my STYLE!"""
04-05-2018T04:44:50,Bgrmystr2,"both of those, just holes"
04-05-2018T04:44:53,SageSaga,"and im like ""The way you draw sucks then, and your style is crap"""
04-05-2018T04:44:53,ZRO4825,I have my own style in art too. I call it procrastinatus maximus. :V
04-05-2018T04:45:02,Bgrmystr2,zro pls xD
04-05-2018T04:45:04,SageSaga,but then im like - well theres some burned bridges!
04-05-2018T04:45:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,My style is uuuuhhhhh it looks like this today
04-05-2018T04:45:14,Bgrmystr2,yeh sage
04-05-2018T04:45:35,Bgrmystr2,This squiggle? Yeah that's my today. That squaggle? That was yesterday.
04-05-2018T04:45:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
04-05-2018T04:45:59,SageSaga,"or my favorite ""Well at least it looks better than yours!"" Yep- im not perfect- its harder to see our own flaws- im just trying to help you with yours while you just put me down"""
04-05-2018T04:46:23,ZRO4825,I see flaws everywhere. In my own stuff. :joy:
04-05-2018T04:46:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,same
04-05-2018T04:46:35,Bgrmystr2,xD
04-05-2018T04:46:48,SageSaga,you probably dont even see all of em
04-05-2018T04:46:55,ZRO4825,I guarantee that!
04-05-2018T04:46:59,Bgrmystr2,xD
04-05-2018T04:47:04,ZRO4825,Cuz every time I turn around I find another! =D
04-05-2018T04:47:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Thats why I send the refs to a ass ton of people and say ""How fix?"""
04-05-2018T04:47:21,SageSaga,ive been doing this long enough to give suggestions on how to fix certain flaws though
04-05-2018T04:47:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,not refs sketches
04-05-2018T04:47:50,ZRO4825,"I just look at my own sketches and go ""...that ain't right. I've seen enough art to know that ain't right. Now how the hell do I FIX?"" XD"
04-05-2018T04:48:01,SageSaga,but people just think im being mean or condescending so they dont take my advice and no one helps me
04-05-2018T04:48:09,Bgrmystr2,"After hanging out here on Picarto with so many artists for a couple years now, I'm learning more and more about stuff"
04-05-2018T04:48:28,ZRO4825,I have learned. I need to learn more.
04-05-2018T04:48:44,ZRO4825,"Also, muscle memory. Need to learn a lot more of that....whiiiiich doesn't happen enough....cuz I'm a slacker. &lt;_&lt;;;;"
04-05-2018T04:48:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I need to force knowledge into my head

04-05-2018T04:50:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,its what I got and its pretty cheap
04-05-2018T04:50:01,ZRO4825,Where is Parblo Coast and why is it a 10?
04-05-2018T04:50:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"10"""

04-05-2018T04:51:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,darn
04-05-2018T04:51:16,SageSaga,i would go for a bigger one at that price
04-05-2018T04:51:26,SageSaga,300-450USD
04-05-2018T04:51:36,SageSaga,get a 13-16 inch one
04-05-2018T04:51:40,Bgrmystr2,"I wish I could give criticism, sage, but I don't feel I know enough. You'd know anything I do plus more, cuz, yknow, artist."

04-05-2018T04:51:56,SageSaga,Wacom is top tier stuff- but not needed
04-05-2018T04:51:59,ZRO4825,"Sadly though, with Wacom, you're paying for the brand too"
04-05-2018T04:52:01,SageSaga,others have gotten very good
04-05-2018T04:52:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Like Huion

04-05-2018T04:53:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yep
04-05-2018T04:53:51,SageSaga,im using a driver from like a year and a half ago because the newest one wouldnt let me map to just the cintiq
04-05-2018T04:54:01,SageSaga,it mapped to my L shaped display
04-05-2018T04:54:15,ZRO4825,O_o
04-05-2018T04:54:19,ZRO4825,Odd
04-05-2018T04:54:37,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
04-05-2018T04:54:48,Bgrmystr2,You have an L-shaped display?
04-05-2018T04:55:44,SageSaga,its L shaped because i have 2 monitors and my tablet- So it looks like this -
04-05-2018T04:56:43,SageSaga,so the wallpaper is -
04-05-2018T04:57:16,SageSaga,L shape
04-05-2018T04:57:24,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering: huh
04-05-2018T04:57:32,Bgrmystr2,I see
04-05-2018T04:57:46,Bgrmystr2,I thought you had a physical monitor that was L shaped
04-05-2018T04:57:47,SageSaga,and if your pen is mapped like that the tablet works like this-
04-05-2018T04:57:51,Bgrmystr2,and I'm like.. I gotta see this
04-05-2018T04:58:30,Bgrmystr2,"wait, ..aaa"
04-05-2018T04:58:32,Bgrmystr2,why
04-05-2018T04:58:33,ZRO4825,"I had trouble with mine doing that sorta when I was going dual display. Took me a bit to figure out how to get it not do that crap, lol"
04-05-2018T04:58:43,SageSaga,if i followed the dotted line it would map to the ENTIRE desktop
04-05-2018T04:58:52,Bgrmystr2,wow
04-05-2018T04:58:56,SageSaga,and i would have this Dead square too!
04-05-2018T04:59:15,Bgrmystr2,I guess what they're trying to do is make it so you can use all four displays as one screen
04-05-2018T04:59:24,Bgrmystr2,for your art
04-05-2018T04:59:28,Bgrmystr2,instead of just your tablet alone
04-05-2018T04:59:48,ZRO4825,"Yeah, which SUCKS, lol"
04-05-2018T05:00:03,Bgrmystr2,"well, I dunno if that'd suck if you had the right setup"
04-05-2018T05:00:06,ZRO4825,doubly not helpful with one like Sage's where the screen is built-in
04-05-2018T05:00:20,Bgrmystr2,but I can understand why sage doesn't like it
04-05-2018T05:00:23,ZRO4825,One like mine where there's no screen would actually be better suited to that (but it still sucked)
04-05-2018T05:00:26,Bgrmystr2,I don't see why it should be mandatory
04-05-2018T05:00:43,Bgrmystr2,it's not something you can change in the settings?
04-05-2018T05:00:50,ZRO4825,Why would you wanna draw on another monitor when you have a screen right under your fingers? :o
04-05-2018T05:01:17,ZRO4825,"And it was probably being dumb, mine I had to go in and set it so that it was application specific, so if I tabbed in to CLIP it limited it to the one monitor"
04-05-2018T05:01:24,SageSaga,the driver would fight with Windows Tablet over who had control with the new driver
04-05-2018T05:01:28,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
04-05-2018T05:01:41,ZRO4825,"But I had a couple times where it was just like ""Fuck you, I'm gonna send the thingie on the other screen!"""
04-05-2018T05:01:52,Bgrmystr2,would the tablet display the whole image?
04-05-2018T05:01:54,SageSaga,and for some reason Wacom removed some options from the driver software to better control it- so im using a really old driver that still has it
04-05-2018T05:02:07,Bgrmystr2,I see
04-05-2018T05:02:40,SageSaga,if windows recognized the pen it wouldnt be an issue
04-05-2018T05:03:00,Bgrmystr2,"I think what it's probably for is so people can use the tablet by itself, and then connect it to a computer with four displays, so you can see the image bigger than the tablet screen size"
04-05-2018T05:03:01,SageSaga,because you can map things as touch or pen displays- however- while i can map it with the touch-
04-05-2018T05:03:09,SageSaga,the pen is not recognized without wacom
04-05-2018T05:03:50,SageSaga,so i can get windows to recognize the tablet as a pen device which would make it to just that display in windowsa
04-05-2018T05:03:55,SageSaga,which would fix it all
04-05-2018T05:04:27,Bgrmystr2,sounds like a lot of complicatedness.
04-05-2018T05:04:34,Bgrmystr2,though Drivers always are
04-05-2018T05:04:44,SageSaga,yeah- i even contacted Wacom about it
04-05-2018T05:04:50,SageSaga,"they said ""Use the old driver"""
04-05-2018T05:05:01,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh: well then
04-05-2018T05:05:04,ZRO4825,:facepalm:
04-05-2018T05:05:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,-__
04-05-2018T05:05:25,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, drivers, for the most part, are just so that way the computer understand the tools you're using properly"
04-05-2018T05:05:28,ZRO4825,"That is the worst facepalm emoji I think I've seen, wth..."
04-05-2018T05:05:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
04-05-2018T05:05:44,SageSaga,:csagesaga-c1:
04-05-2018T05:05:53,ZRO4825,"ty Sage, that one's much better."
04-05-2018T05:06:05,ZRO4825,Wait...has anyone actually facepalmed in Yosh! I can't remember. :joy:
04-05-2018T05:06:15,ZRO4825,I think one of the robot ladies did when dealing with Phil? :thinking:
04-05-2018T05:06:57,SageSaga,there have been Facepalms- im sure nami has racked up the most
04-05-2018T05:07:54,SageSaga,Nami is also one of Mihari's favorite characters
04-05-2018T05:10:15,SageSaga,have yall seen RE: Zero?
04-05-2018T05:10:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,not yet
04-05-2018T05:10:24,ZRO4825,I stopped on episode....
04-05-2018T05:10:40,Bgrmystr2,Who's Rem? :thinking: /aaaaaaaaaasound/
04-05-2018T05:10:40,ZRO4825,19
04-05-2018T05:10:56,SageSaga,whhhhhhyyyyy?!
04-05-2018T05:11:19,Bgrmystr2,not sure if sage is reacting to them or me but it amuses me either way :ptv-laugh:
04-05-2018T05:11:38,ZRO4825,Because Subaru makes me want to throw breakable things.
04-05-2018T05:12:04,Bgrmystr2,so.. throwing things in general then?
04-05-2018T05:12:09,SageSaga,Hes even more of a dick in the Lightnovel- but! its the whole point! Hes a character that GROWS!
04-05-2018T05:12:14,SageSaga,he gets better
04-05-2018T05:12:18,SageSaga,except for with Rem-
04-05-2018T05:12:25,ZRO4825,But he's so damned DUMB. &gt;:(
04-05-2018T05:12:36,ZRO4825,He reminds me of the people I get stuck on teams with in Overwatch.
04-05-2018T05:12:37,SageSaga,he doesnt deserve Rem anyways!
04-05-2018T05:12:45,Bgrmystr2,not even remotely dumb compared to a lot of other protags I've seen
04-05-2018T05:12:59,ZRO4825,He's pretty damned dumb. &lt;_&lt;;
04-05-2018T05:13:05,Bgrmystr2,Yes he is.
04-05-2018T05:13:07,SageSaga,man i would love to have a Subaru on my Overwatch games
04-05-2018T05:13:15,ZRO4825,&lt;_&lt;;;;;
04-05-2018T05:13:21,Bgrmystr2,and he looks like a genius compared to some others..
04-05-2018T05:13:46,SageSaga,"""Dont ask me how i know but Genji is going to dive in the back, and the Reaper is going to drop from that window- get ready - 3 - 2 -1-"""
04-05-2018T05:13:58,Bgrmystr2,right xD
04-05-2018T05:14:01,ZRO4825,"I won't deny he's had character growth, but it's like...for all his growth, he's still so damned dumb it hurts."
04-05-2018T05:14:01,Bgrmystr2,that'd be great

04-05-2018T05:15:10,Bgrmystr2,"and he next time he wakes up and says that ""Who's Genji?"" /aaaaaaaaa/ :v"
04-05-2018T05:16:03,SageSaga,have you seen Re Zero in 8 minutes?
04-05-2018T05:16:09,ZRO4825,"I DO need to finish the series, especially after getting this far in it, I just...I turn it on, Subaru starts talking, and my brain just goes ""nope nope nope, done."""

04-05-2018T05:18:15,ZRO4825,Felix is a not a trap.
04-05-2018T05:18:19,ZRO4825,Felix is a motherfucking ambush.
04-05-2018T05:19:07,Bgrmystr2,Yeh I like Felix's design
04-05-2018T05:19:37,SageSaga,"Felix is a Jojo twist - its like ""I DONT KNOW WHATS GOING ON BUT IM OK WITH IT AND THIS IS AWESOME!"""

04-05-2018T05:19:54,ZRO4825,I've been slowly working my way through that one.
04-05-2018T05:20:13,SageSaga,Jojo is great- it really seems to be true what they say about it
04-05-2018T05:20:20,Bgrmystr2,"Sage.. is that guy in the 3rd panel on the left, carrying a bow?"
04-05-2018T05:20:23,Bgrmystr2,or what are they carrying?

04-05-2018T05:21:43,SageSaga,he's actually just got a big club- hes the Wagon driver- not a scholar like the others so hes actually physically strong

04-05-2018T12:21:08,SiliconCarbide,heyo
04-05-2018T12:22:28,Vatruvius,Still go the merged chat I see.
04-05-2018T12:22:31,Vatruvius,Hey Sage!
04-05-2018T13:45:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw buff grandpa at Walmart
04-05-2018T14:04:54,TheBeckoner,How buff
04-05-2018T14:04:57,TheBeckoner,?*
04-05-2018T14:35:20,Twokinds,:ptv-greetings:
04-05-2018T14:42:36,TheBeckoner,Hello Tom. How goes it?
04-05-2018T14:48:08,Twokinds,Not bad. A little sleepy.
04-05-2018T14:48:21,Twokinds,Looks like our D&D game might be cancelled tonight.
04-05-2018T15:07:18,TheBeckoner,"That sucks, why's that?"
04-05-2018T15:38:20,Dadrobit,Fluff discovered his inner Mexicano and is going hard on the Cinco de Mayo celebrations! :)
04-05-2018T15:38:36,TheBeckoner,"Yeah, I saw that on sages stream lol"
04-05-2018T15:43:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Buff grandpa looked like a square with arms. That buff
04-05-2018T15:44:06,SpazztasticKiwi,And idk who was in that ladies bathroom last but I go in to make sure all my hair is in the ponytail and it smells like a perfume factory in here
04-05-2018T15:44:13,SpazztasticKiwi,*there
04-05-2018T16:00:48,Twokinds,That doesn't seem weird. I often notice perfume every time I enter the ladies bathroom.
04-05-2018T16:13:40,SpazztasticKiwi,:ptv-shock:you need to be arrested
04-05-2018T16:17:11,zolstarym,Yes. Perfume smelling is a 4th degree felony in over 30 states
04-05-2018T16:18:11,NickTheName,Also in Europe
04-05-2018T16:28:17,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs easier ways to smell perfume anyway. Ways that don‚Äôt get you booked at the station
04-05-2018T16:36:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"By the way yesterday was May the Fourth be with you (which I don‚Äôt celebrate for a few reasons), and today is Happy Revenge of the Fifth"
04-05-2018T17:31:11,Bgrmystr2,it's also considered cinco de mayo
04-05-2018T17:31:16,Bgrmystr2,for many more people
04-05-2018T17:35:59,PhilTheIdle,Hi
04-05-2018T17:37:06,PhilTheIdle,"I just came home and what I see is that Tom seems to stalk women, this chat is weird."
04-05-2018T17:37:48,Bgrmystr2,taking everything Tom says at face value seriously is the first sign that you're new here.
04-05-2018T17:38:36,PhilTheIdle,I take nothing seriously. Not even me.
04-05-2018T17:39:16,Bgrmystr2,"xD Your previous statement states the opposite, but mkay"
04-05-2018T17:39:35,Bgrmystr2,Welcome to the chat regardless. It gets weird here because the rule of funny.
04-05-2018T17:42:44,PhilTheIdle,"That's why I just wrote it. It's always perplexing how conversations develop. I mean, who goes into the ladies bathroom. According to South Park it must be VERY nice and all but it'd be too weird. Tom wouldn't do this. He is a gentle man. Like a knight"
04-05-2018T17:42:49,PhilTheIdle,in the night.
04-05-2018T17:45:54,PhilTheIdle,"Haha, got the pun? Because knight and night. It's different words but they are pronounced the same way. Ha...Haha...ha... ok, it wasn't really funny."
04-05-2018T18:56:31,Vatruvius,Hello people! :ptv-greetings:
04-05-2018T19:16:38,Vatruvius,:ptv-sleepy:
04-05-2018T19:22:45,SpazztasticKiwi,The ladies room isn‚Äôt always plese
04-05-2018T19:23:18,SpazztasticKiwi,plesant; there‚Äôs some messy and inconsiderate people
04-05-2018T19:34:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"As for Tom‚Äôs brand of jokes, I‚Äôll say he has a certain...charm with them. Certainly knows how to turn heads :ptv-tease:"
04-05-2018T19:39:47,Vatruvius,That he does.
04-05-2018T20:17:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm using this avocado dressing for a blt salad
04-05-2018T20:17:47,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs good
04-05-2018T20:26:29,NightMeaty22,Hello
04-05-2018T20:33:02,Vatruvius,That sounds good.
04-05-2018T20:35:47,NightMeaty22,Hi vatru
04-05-2018T20:36:10,NightMeaty22,How you doing
04-05-2018T20:36:12,Vatruvius,Hey Meaty.
04-05-2018T20:36:16,Vatruvius,Doing alright.
04-05-2018T20:36:29,NightMeaty22,Thats good
04-05-2018T20:36:48,NightMeaty22,3 more days
04-05-2018T20:42:00,Vatruvius,Three more days until what?
04-05-2018T20:45:05,NightMeaty22,I get my braces tightened
04-05-2018T20:46:40,NightMeaty22,And that is a very bad b-day gift
04-05-2018T20:53:39,NightMeaty22,Oh well
04-05-2018T20:55:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tomorrow has to be Sunday. If it wasn‚Äôt, I‚Äôd be taking Bagheera to the vet then"
04-05-2018T20:55:52,NightMeaty22,May i ask why?
04-05-2018T20:56:35,SpazztasticKiwi,He‚Äôs showing signs of a respiratory infection
04-05-2018T20:56:46,NightMeaty22,Oh
04-05-2018T20:56:50,Vatruvius,Not good.
04-05-2018T20:56:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"Wheezing, tiredness, and irritation"
04-05-2018T20:56:58,NightMeaty22,Crap...
04-05-2018T20:57:07,SpazztasticKiwi,And a lack of appetite it seems
04-05-2018T20:57:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Last night he was even gagging and giving little coughs
04-05-2018T20:58:00,Vatruvius,"I hope Bagheera gets better soon. How is Jelly Bean? Doing well, is Kiwi still upset? Is it Kiwi or Bagheera that is upset?"
04-05-2018T20:58:36,Vatruvius,Jealous would be a more apt word than upset.
04-05-2018T20:59:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera still doesn‚Äôt like the tiny baby. Little baby is doing fine
04-05-2018T21:05:08,SpazztasticKiwi,If I find out he‚Äôs been poisoned I‚Äôm gonna commit murder
04-05-2018T21:06:08,Vatruvius,Poisoned? What do you mean?
04-05-2018T21:06:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"The gagging, not eating, and tiredness"
04-05-2018T21:07:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"He doesn‚Äôt show all the signs, not major ones, but some are similar"
04-05-2018T21:12:01,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs most likely he just has a respiratory infection or bad hairball. I just hope it‚Äôs nothing that needs surgery or untreatable
04-05-2018T21:13:07,BadFoMo,"He's not my cat, but I hope so too."
04-05-2018T21:15:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm getting him to eat some kibble from hand but the test will be if he holds it down
04-05-2018T21:20:58,Vatruvius,"Okay, sketch suggestion submitted."
04-05-2018T21:26:36,CrRAR,:DD
04-05-2018T21:26:51,CrRAR,what  did you decide?
04-05-2018T21:27:29,CrRAR,Sax Troupe?
04-05-2018T21:33:42,Vatruvius,I went with the Maren/Trace suggestion. It became really sappy which is what I like. If it does not get picked and was not even a close vote then I will do the Jazz Bar. If it was a close vote I will suggest it again next week.
04-05-2018T21:49:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom is suspiciously good with sappy
04-05-2018T21:49:54,Bgrmystr2,why is it suspicious?
04-05-2018T21:52:21,SpazztasticKiwi,He‚Äôs never shown any signs of sappy before. Just mellow
04-05-2018T21:52:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Mellow Tom-o
04-05-2018T21:53:15,unsteddyphoenix,Real men dont show sappy emotions
04-05-2018T21:53:21,unsteddyphoenix,Like me
04-05-2018T21:54:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"I saw a story about a lady that makes about $50,000 a year. Guess how"
04-05-2018T21:54:24,unsteddyphoenix,that literally sounds like a clickbait ad
04-05-2018T21:54:44,SpazztasticKiwi,She makes outfits for chickens
04-05-2018T21:55:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I find it very hard to believe but at the same time it‚Äôs not the weirdest thing I‚Äôve heard
04-05-2018T22:08:20,Vatruvius,I heard about a business where they sold literal rocks in boxes and advertised taking care of your pet rock. It was apparently very successful.
04-05-2018T22:17:18,Dadrobit,"Mmmmm, reminds me that I need to submit mine."
04-05-2018T22:17:35,Dadrobit,"Also, inb4 ""The TK cast as pet rocks"""
04-05-2018T22:22:44,Dadrobit,Aaaand done.
04-05-2018T22:30:17,Vatruvius,"Wait, you are suggesting that?"
04-05-2018T22:35:40,Dadrobit,"No, I'm suggesting Sythe in diplomatic regalia riding a super sized nibbly in the middle of doing an Akira Power Slide."
04-05-2018T22:46:56,Vatruvius,Sounds interesting.
04-05-2018T22:47:12,Vatruvius,Though I think I miss the reference with the power slide thing.

04-05-2018T22:49:32,Dadrobit,"I'm hedging my bets that most people won't get the reference, but they've vote for it anyways because of Nibbly."
04-05-2018T22:57:01,WolfAppledore,"A friend of mine, since I can't directly, suggested that Kat, Mike, Flora, and Clovis are dressed up as Characters from Samurai Pizza Cats."
04-05-2018T23:01:23,Vatruvius,Looks like a popular slide.
04-05-2018T23:14:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Just watched Mark‚Äôs recent video. Tom has it good with 200 prints to sign
04-05-2018T23:14:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"Mark has 35,000 calendars to autograph"
04-05-2018T23:15:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"If I were Tom, I‚Äôd call Mark just to laugh maniacally and hang up, cause that‚Äôs pretty golden"
04-05-2018T23:23:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"Hope he‚Äôs ok after all that though. It‚Äôs gonna be some serious work. Work well worth it, but work"
04-05-2018T23:26:47,Vatruvius,"I am surprised that Mark did not think he would have tens of thousands of calendars to sign. I thought that was obvious. I guess he thought not many people would but tasteful nudes of him. He was very, very wrong."
04-05-2018T23:29:46,Vatruvius,I think Tom actually has 600 prints to sign. I know the original was 400 prints but they sold out the first day and Tom did not want that so I think a few more were made available.
04-05-2018T23:31:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm sure Mark had a solid idea of the hole he was digging for himself
04-05-2018T23:31:44,SpazztasticKiwi,But he‚Äôs stubborn and determined so he did it anyway
04-05-2018T23:32:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"I feel he‚Äôs gonna have the most fun signing his own conveniently censored self 35,000 times"
04-05-2018T23:33:25,Vatruvius,"He should make one of his funny couple minute videos with fake blood and stuff. ""Have to...sign...all of them..."" Finger nails falling off, sleepless eyes, just pure horror."
04-05-2018T23:33:35,Vatruvius,lol
04-05-2018T23:39:10,SpazztasticKiwi,He said he‚Äôs gonna be posting updates as it all goes
04-05-2018T23:45:01,Vatruvius,Still want to see a funny update video like I described.
04-05-2018T23:45:04,Vatruvius,Would be fun.
04-05-2018T23:49:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"Strangely enough, it‚Äôs not too far fetched for him"
