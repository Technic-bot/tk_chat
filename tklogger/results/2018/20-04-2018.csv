20-04-2018T00:53:18,Dadrobit,"Well, he pretty openly calls me daddy."
20-04-2018T00:53:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,daddy me daddy
20-04-2018T00:53:29,Vatruvius,I would not say a beard qualifies you as being a hairy man. :thinking:
20-04-2018T00:53:36,Dadrobit,*Dad intensifies*
20-04-2018T00:53:41,Bgrmystr2,"I'd agree, vatru"
20-04-2018T00:53:56,Vatruvius,"I would qualify as hairy, runs in the family."
20-04-2018T00:54:47,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"I guess I'm kinda hairy, but only if I haven't shaved in a while. And my hair is blonde, so unless people are touching me you can't really tell"
20-04-2018T00:55:09,Dadrobit,"I'm hairy, but I manscape."
20-04-2018T00:55:10,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: no touchy
20-04-2018T00:55:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,pls tell you did not tough the beard dad
20-04-2018T00:55:51,Bgrmystr2,why would he not tough the beard?
20-04-2018T00:55:57,Bgrmystr2,It should be strong beard
20-04-2018T00:55:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,touch

20-04-2018T00:56:07,Vatruvius,I could not be in a relationship with a girl who wanted me to shave my body or wax it. She either has to like it or find a hairless man.
20-04-2018T00:56:11,Ordithus,Love young Natani's pose/expression in panel 3
20-04-2018T00:56:14,Bgrmystr2,oh well touching the beard is borign

20-04-2018T00:57:56,Vatruvius,"I like a nice short scruff, once it gets beyond that if gets a bit much."

20-04-2018T02:33:41,ZRO4825,Heyyo X.x/
20-04-2018T02:33:43,SageSaga,we were just talking about you like 30 minutes ago
20-04-2018T02:34:10,ZRO4825,Oh? Please tell me only the worst things were said about me. I have a reputation to maintain. D:
20-04-2018T02:34:28,SageSaga,that you never invite me to play MHW with you
20-04-2018T02:34:46,ZRO4825,"Oh...well, that'd be true. I don't wanna end up seeming like a pest. :joy:"
20-04-2018T02:34:49,Bgrmystr2,They think you're afraid of sage asking you for suggestions :v
20-04-2018T02:35:01,Bgrmystr2,cuz clearly you have run out of ideas
20-04-2018T02:35:12,ZRO4825,I am very scared of being asked for suggestions. One day I may finally find one that Sage has to facepalm about and tell me no.
20-04-2018T02:35:29,Bgrmystr2,haha
20-04-2018T02:35:37,unsteddyphoenix,"Woah, Mihari was right"
20-04-2018T02:35:48,ZRO4825,Hell naw. I kid on the being scared.
20-04-2018T02:36:03,ZRO4825,Though I am curious when I'm gonna find that one that makes Sage say no. :rofl:
20-04-2018T02:36:27,SageSaga,sometimes- i just leave myself in a public MHW lobby for hours at a time- hoping a friend will hop in or invite me
20-04-2018T02:36:41,SageSaga,but they never do...
20-04-2018T02:36:46,unsteddyphoenix,Christ Sage :ctwokinds-sadtrace2:
20-04-2018T02:36:58,SageSaga,just Sage is fine
20-04-2018T02:37:14,ZRO4825,"Wish I'd known that before. I see you sitting in sessions at like 4/16 and I keep thinking ""Oh, he's got friends and that's 4 so that's full quests. Better hadn't bug him."" ._&gt;;"
20-04-2018T02:37:17,ZRO4825,._.;*
20-04-2018T02:37:30,SageSaga,dont you lie to me
20-04-2018T02:37:42,SageSaga,99% of the time its a lobby of 1/16
20-04-2018T02:37:42,unsteddyphoenix,hahaha
20-04-2018T02:37:43,ZRO4825,"I no lie, I swearz on Toyoko's bras."
20-04-2018T02:38:01,unsteddyphoenix,What a wacky misunderstanding
20-04-2018T02:38:09,unsteddyphoenix,*cue romcom opening credits*
20-04-2018T02:38:23,SageSaga,i was in an actually active one yesterday but that was to do the big event thing- and ive only killed it twice T_T
20-04-2018T02:38:25,ZRO4825,Will somebody please cue that boid?
20-04-2018T02:38:39,ZRO4825,I think I've got a whopping 3 kills on it myself.
20-04-2018T02:38:54,ZRO4825,Or was it only 2? I'm actually not completely certain.
20-04-2018T02:39:04,ZRO4825,Trying to down that thing solo though is a BITCH :rofl:
20-04-2018T02:39:09,SageSaga,"i was in one and this guy had an auto thing when you died and it said ""Wow you suck and should give up on this game"""
20-04-2018T02:39:17,ZRO4825,-.-
20-04-2018T02:39:29,SageSaga,so i stopped healing him and he carted the other 2 times and failed the mission for us
20-04-2018T02:39:36,ZRO4825,LMAO!!!
20-04-2018T02:39:38,ZRO4825,Karma! &lt;3
20-04-2018T02:40:35,unsteddyphoenix,That guy doesnt sound like the sharpest bulb in the box :thinking:
20-04-2018T02:40:39,SageSaga,i posted a picture on twitter of one of my victories against it
20-04-2018T02:41:06,SageSaga,https://twitter.com/Sagesaga/status/987236123268255746
20-04-2018T02:41:24,ZRO4825,lol
20-04-2018T02:41:55,SageSaga,that is an actual victory screen- i had just slammed my shield into it's head when he knocked me out of the air and killed me- and then the guy with the hammer smacked him and the horns busted
20-04-2018T02:42:58,SageSaga,plus side- the death thing made me skip his run away animation- so i was able to make it back just in time to carve while the other guy running back already got caught in the animation-
20-04-2018T02:43:13,ZRO4825,Nice~
20-04-2018T02:43:13,SageSaga,i actually ran past him on my way back down while he was stuck in the animation XD
20-04-2018T02:43:31,Bgrmystr2,"Hey zro, I think sage is saying to play with him :v"
20-04-2018T02:43:33,SageSaga,he didnt make it in time to get all the carves XD
20-04-2018T02:43:36,Bgrmystr2,I could be wrong
20-04-2018T02:43:40,Bgrmystr2,but maybe..
20-04-2018T02:43:42,Bgrmystr2,just maybe
20-04-2018T02:44:06,ZRO4825,"Well, from the sounds of it, I can't do any worse than his randoms have, and at least I don't have any asinine statements in my auto messages :P"
20-04-2018T02:44:14,SageSaga,if no one wants me to play with them i'll just solo it
20-04-2018T02:45:48,ZRO4825,"Hell naw, I'll happily go kill it with ya, lol. Getting the random weapons is kinda fun."
20-04-2018T02:46:03,SageSaga,i want 2 of the 8 tier bows
20-04-2018T02:46:59,SageSaga,there is a 360 damage thunder bow and a 360 blast bow

20-04-2018T03:02:20,ZRO4825,:joy:
20-04-2018T03:02:26,SageSaga,it is Serena
20-04-2018T03:02:48,ZRO4825,"Explains why I couldn't quite place her though. Been a while since she's been in a sketch, lol"
20-04-2018T03:03:41,SageSaga,well she will be a sketch this week but next week hopefully she'll be in color
20-04-2018T03:04:01,ZRO4825,"I was actually contemplating her for next month's for my image, funny enough."
20-04-2018T03:04:11,ZRO4825,But I'm thinking I might go with Michelle
20-04-2018T03:06:03,SageSaga,Michelle is nice too
20-04-2018T03:06:13,SageSaga,you know what might be even better though?

20-04-2018T03:07:30,ZRO4825,"And what're you thinkin this time, Sage? :P"
20-04-2018T03:07:30,SageSaga,i was gonna say  asking for a 2 character commission so i can sketch it next month and wont have to color it because next month is my trip month and thus less stream and work time-
20-04-2018T03:07:38,ZRO4825,:thinking:
20-04-2018T03:08:06,ZRO4825,That...might actually make my idea even funnier. :joy:
20-04-2018T03:08:09,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
20-04-2018T03:08:26,ZRO4825,"Cuz I was thinking maybe have Michelle testing the ""adult rating"" in the VR settings to make sure it works. :rofl:"
20-04-2018T03:08:40,SageSaga,just say'n- also ive got 2 sketch slots open that havent been filled-
20-04-2018T03:08:47,ZRO4825,:(

20-04-2018T03:26:13,ZRO4825,That much is very true.
20-04-2018T03:26:24,ZRO4825,One of the comms I got of my snow leopard lady was a dancing pose.
20-04-2018T03:26:51,SageSaga,i had a really good ref but i didnt want to copy it- and i went too stiff
20-04-2018T03:26:57,SageSaga,so im trying to loosen it up
20-04-2018T03:27:50,SageSaga,this is called Gestural drawing - its very rough- more so than my usual stuff
20-04-2018T03:28:16,SageSaga,but it lets you play with the shape and flow a lot
20-04-2018T03:30:47,ZRO4825,"I need to start working on my art stuff again. Badly. I've just been so damned burnt out over work and other stress stuff that I pull out my tablet and my brain just goes ""Bleeeeeeeeeh"""
20-04-2018T03:33:26,SageSaga,"when your brain does that just draw anyways- if you dont know what just go ""Cute girl"" and draw"
20-04-2018T03:34:12,eluneakbar,nice
20-04-2018T03:34:23,ZRO4825,lol
20-04-2018T03:38:26,Barabashe4ka,Tom
20-04-2018T03:38:34,ZRO4825,went to bed
20-04-2018T03:44:54,SageSaga,this is another technique
20-04-2018T03:45:08,SageSaga,"is called ""line of motion"""
20-04-2018T03:45:24,Bgrmystr2,line of motion is awesome
20-04-2018T03:45:31,Bgrmystr2,"learned about that from somewhere, don't recall where"
20-04-2018T03:47:35,SageSaga,when practicing line of motion i hated it
20-04-2018T03:47:45,SageSaga,not because of how it worked- but my teacher
20-04-2018T03:48:35,SageSaga,"it was like - if anything- ANYTHING wasnt following the line of motion it was like ""NO! FOLLOW THE LINE!"" and im like ""ARMS DONT WORK THAT WAY!"""
20-04-2018T03:48:49,ZRO4825,:joy:
20-04-2018T03:49:38,ZRO4825,Two Serenas? I'm okay with this idea.
20-04-2018T03:50:31,ZRO4825,"Ugh, I am not going to enjoy tomorrow. Being stuck at work as late as I was, I probably won't be able to sleep for another 2 or 3 hours...."
20-04-2018T03:54:53,SageSaga,alright
20-04-2018T03:55:05,SageSaga,this one might go into next month-
20-04-2018T03:55:25,SageSaga,i'll do what i can with it next week but im gonna have to call it here
20-04-2018T03:56:00,ZRO4825,"Yeah, gettin kinda late, lol"
20-04-2018T03:56:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Sage Thank you for the Strambie
20-04-2018T03:56:46,SageSaga,take care folks thanks for joining me

20-04-2018T03:58:05,Bgrmystr2,"kinda dropped out the end of it sorry, been helpin a friend fix his mic setup"
20-04-2018T03:58:18,SageSaga,np
20-04-2018T03:58:58,Barabashe4ka,Tom ignores :angry:
20-04-2018T03:59:11,SageSaga,?
20-04-2018T04:00:09,SageSaga,you ok Barab?
20-04-2018T04:00:34,Bgrmystr2,tom went to sleep before you came in bro :u
20-04-2018T04:00:41,Bgrmystr2,"least I believe so, from what I saw"
20-04-2018T04:01:04,Barabashe4ka,It is written that he is online
20-04-2018T04:01:17,SageSaga,he leaves his PC on like i do
20-04-2018T04:01:35,Barabashe4ka,Well then fine
20-04-2018T04:01:37,SageSaga,he went to bed an hour ago
20-04-2018T04:01:54,SageSaga,want me to call him and wake him up?
20-04-2018T04:02:03,Barabashe4ka,No
20-04-2018T04:02:04,SageSaga,it is only 5am
20-04-2018T04:02:05,ZRO4825,"Can confirm, he said his goodnights a while ago."
20-04-2018T04:02:18,Bgrmystr2,haha
20-04-2018T04:02:35,Barabashe4ka,Let him sleep
20-04-2018T04:05:00,Bgrmystr2,"I presume if something absolutely terribly horribly wrong happened, like with the site or somethin, would tom fix it in the morning? or would he want to wake up then"
20-04-2018T04:05:14,Bgrmystr2,I don't know if he runs the site himself
20-04-2018T04:05:18,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
20-04-2018T04:05:29,SageSaga,he doesnt really- he has some control over it but he mostly has a guy for that
20-04-2018T04:05:45,MarshallMelon,"Amenon, I believe"
20-04-2018T04:05:46,SageSaga,i knew his name too- what was it-
20-04-2018T04:05:54,Bgrmystr2,ahh okay
20-04-2018T04:06:03,Bgrmystr2,I thought Amenon ran the poll site
20-04-2018T04:06:12,Bgrmystr2,does he do the official website too?
20-04-2018T04:06:16,MarshallMelon,S/he handles pretty much anything coding-related from what I can tell
20-04-2018T04:06:23,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:hm
20-04-2018T04:06:29,Bgrmystr2,interesting
20-04-2018T04:06:33,MarshallMelon,Am upgraded the webite a while back and also curates the forums
20-04-2018T04:06:46,MarshallMelon,"*website, damn"
20-04-2018T04:06:54,SageSaga,goes by Amenon now?
20-04-2018T04:07:08,Bgrmystr2,might not be the same person
20-04-2018T04:07:19,Bgrmystr2,you're talkin about the guy who has the uh..
20-04-2018T04:07:22,Bgrmystr2,oh what's that site
20-04-2018T04:07:23,ZRO4825,Amenon I thought just did proofreading stuff...
20-04-2018T04:07:24,SageSaga,well this person did make the poll thing but thats not the name i remember
20-04-2018T04:07:32,MarshallMelon,Lemme check
20-04-2018T04:07:34,Barabashe4ka,Later I will contact him
20-04-2018T04:07:41,Barabashe4ka,Goodbye
20-04-2018T04:07:45,ZRO4825,Amenon is behind the tkpolls
20-04-2018T04:07:52,MarshallMelon,"""Brandon J. Dusseau"""
20-04-2018T04:07:57,MarshallMelon,No idea what their handle is
20-04-2018T04:08:14,Bgrmystr2,the same guy who runs turaiel.me?
20-04-2018T04:08:19,MarshallMelon,Looks like it
20-04-2018T04:08:20,Bgrmystr2,for all the twokinds stuff
20-04-2018T04:08:29,Bgrmystr2,backs up all the stuff
20-04-2018T04:09:03,MarshallMelon,There are two of those now. The other's actually more regularly updated too
20-04-2018T04:09:38,MarshallMelon,"Well, I say ""now"", the other archive's been around for years"
20-04-2018T04:11:17,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
20-04-2018T04:11:53,MarshallMelon,"Are links okay now, Sage?"
20-04-2018T04:12:07,SageSaga,nope
20-04-2018T04:12:11,MarshallMelon,Got it
20-04-2018T04:12:40,SageSaga,i'll cut the multistream so you can all do as you please though XD
20-04-2018T04:12:44,SageSaga,take care folks!
20-04-2018T04:12:57,Bgrmystr2,seeya sage :u
20-04-2018T04:13:00,MarshallMelon,Bye Sage!
20-04-2018T17:26:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Took a nap mid-stream yesterday. Woke up 8 hours later
20-04-2018T19:48:27,Vatruvius,"I think that qualifies as going to bed Kiwi, not a nap."
20-04-2018T19:50:48,Vatruvius,"Which suggestion would you rather I put up this week: ""Nibbly, Sythe, and Raine"" or ""Keith and Natani?"""
20-04-2018T20:19:32,BluePhantom90,hmmm hard choice not big into both combos
20-04-2018T20:29:27,Bgrmystr2,I'd vote both then
20-04-2018T20:29:37,Bgrmystr2,just to bug the ppl who don't like those ships :D
20-04-2018T20:30:13,UnknownEnd,Hello
20-04-2018T20:30:42,UnknownEnd,...

20-04-2018T20:31:37,UnknownEnd,?
20-04-2018T20:31:52,Bgrmystr2,Noon is home
20-04-2018T20:32:09,Bgrmystr2,try again in 12 hours when it's not noon./
20-04-2018T20:32:20,Bgrmystr2,"unless you want noon, but you'd be weird if you like that."
20-04-2018T20:32:20,UnknownEnd,...
20-04-2018T20:33:22,UnknownEnd,Hmm
20-04-2018T20:45:58,Vatruvius,"Does not really help mr dicide but I am leaning towards the ""Keith and Natani"" one so I guess I will submit that one this week."
20-04-2018T20:46:04,Vatruvius,me*
20-04-2018T20:48:36,BluePhantom90,Mine is Flora's baby shower
20-04-2018T21:13:36,Vatruvius,"Not bad, I would like to see that one sketched."
20-04-2018T21:44:58,BluePhantom90,yeah It has all the moms From Twokinds telling Flora the Horror's of child birth
20-04-2018T21:59:19,Vatruvius,"Yeah, I think that one will be fun."
20-04-2018T22:00:17,Vatruvius,I am now considering putting up a suggestion of Raine and Zen on the USS Marv...Marv gets his ship. :P
20-04-2018T22:01:16,Vatruvius,"There would be a twist of course, but you would only know the twist if it gets sketched."
20-04-2018T22:18:27,BluePhantom90,"hmmm Well I had the  Idea ""Modern Wedding, Trace passes out from saying ""I do!"""
20-04-2018T22:18:52,BluePhantom90,"* before he says ""I do"""
