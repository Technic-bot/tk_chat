30-06-2018T13:02:22,Twokinds,'Ello 'ello
30-06-2018T13:02:29,BadFoMo,Yo.

30-06-2018T13:36:32,JamesBSquirrel3,"Mrow! Oh Tom, your online, thank goodness!:ptv-wondering::ptv-scratch:"
30-06-2018T13:41:38,JamesBSquirrel3,"Can I ask importantly, Tom. Is about results of Top 5 Colors, but I'm not uncomfortable of any shuffle random musics for start with anyways. Because can I tell you ...:ptv-wondering:"
30-06-2018T13:42:07,JamesBSquirrel3,... is about Fanfare music of Results Top 5
30-06-2018T13:45:23,JamesBSquirrel3,"Basically, I want something different about results, if you have a music Keyboard or not? Y'see, I need; Fanfare :trumpet:, Cymbal, and Drum Roll for Drums :drum:."
30-06-2018T13:46:42,JamesBSquirrel3,"So you see Tom, I want to change a Fanfare music of Top 5 Sketch results into Colors. Sounds not bad idea?:ptv-wondering:"
30-06-2018T13:48:48,JamesBSquirrel3,I mean if you think about it ever since in months of decades. The Runners-Ups only Cymbal hit one note appear of all Runners-Ups Vote Sketches ...
30-06-2018T13:51:20,Mippy,Yum....Ommelette sandwhich wth hot sauce
30-06-2018T13:51:41,JamesBSquirrel3,.... Then Top 5 moment; a Fanfare :drum: Drum Roll in between 15/30 seconds until each sketch appears for Cymbal from flashing drum-roll in Top 5. You get this what I mean? Hey Tom?
30-06-2018T13:52:05,Twokinds,"That'd be great, but I'm not really a sound guy."
30-06-2018T13:52:25,Twokinds,I don't know how to do a lot of custom sound cues like that.
30-06-2018T13:53:12,JamesBSquirrel3,"Aww, why not for a reasons, if so, then that was a shame.:ptv-sad:"
30-06-2018T13:53:47,Twokinds,Maybe in the future
30-06-2018T13:54:27,JamesBSquirrel3,Maybe someday will never know.:ptv-scratch:
30-06-2018T13:55:12,JamesBSquirrel3,"So I try for you, but no need to worry. Next time - soon, yeah?"
30-06-2018T13:55:19,Twokinds,Yeah maybe
30-06-2018T13:55:28,Twokinds,I'm gunna go to the store to get some snacks for the stream

30-06-2018T14:27:59,CrRAR,Awesome!
30-06-2018T14:29:48,TerraTheWizard,hewwo~
30-06-2018T14:30:54,Combak,Hey Terra.
30-06-2018T14:32:13,TheGamePlayer,Hi
30-06-2018T14:32:19,TheGamePlayer,I'm here now
30-06-2018T14:32:29,Combak,Hi The.
30-06-2018T14:32:33,TheGamePlayer,Hi
30-06-2018T14:33:19,TheGamePlayer,So I've began my repurchasing on alot of my games that have suffered from disk rot...
30-06-2018T14:33:28,TheGamePlayer,Yay
30-06-2018T14:34:06,TheGamePlayer,Can't complain though disks don't last forever
30-06-2018T14:34:24,Xexanoth,thats why you should have digital backups of your discs
30-06-2018T14:34:38,Bgrmystr2,"not easy to do though, Xex"
30-06-2018T14:34:44,TheGamePlayer,Ya I have those but their useless
30-06-2018T14:35:00,TheGamePlayer,I can't play them without using a disk
30-06-2018T14:35:12,Bgrmystr2,not true
30-06-2018T14:35:21,Bgrmystr2,just get a virtual disk program
30-06-2018T14:35:22,TheGamePlayer,So that's why I'm ONLY getting digital copies
30-06-2018T14:35:31,Xexanoth,digital backups are easy BGR....
30-06-2018T14:35:39,TheGamePlayer,For the Xbox 360 bgr?
30-06-2018T14:35:44,Bgrmystr2,not when the CD blocks ISOs
30-06-2018T14:35:52,Bgrmystr2,and no you can't make disk backups for xbox cds
30-06-2018T14:35:57,Bgrmystr2,cuz pc disk drives do not read them
30-06-2018T14:36:35,TheGamePlayer,Their more like data saves just in case the disk saves are corrupted at some point in time
30-06-2018T14:36:40,Xexanoth,not my fault if you're using xbox... :P
30-06-2018T14:36:44,Bgrmystr2,"I have a bunch of ISOs for computer games, old ones, and I use Daemon Tools for a virtual CD drive"
30-06-2018T14:36:50,Bgrmystr2,so I can play games that need the disk
30-06-2018T14:37:02,Bgrmystr2,cuz virtual CD drive acts just like a real one
30-06-2018T14:37:34,TheGamePlayer,I have all digital on PC I don't even know where to find disk copies for pc
30-06-2018T14:37:49,Bgrmystr2,"lol, most every game I have is a physical cd"
30-06-2018T14:38:07,Bgrmystr2,got a cd rack sitting behind me nearly full of crystal cases lol
30-06-2018T14:38:43,Xexanoth,most of my pc disks are old
30-06-2018T14:38:58,Xexanoth,from before digital was a thing
30-06-2018T14:40:31,TheGamePlayer,Well I can't fuss over it but what I can fuss about is that Microsoft didn't make any information on the purchases of disk copies at GameStop
30-06-2018T14:41:23,Bgrmystr2,"as long as it's a new copy and not a used copy, they'll still cover it"
30-06-2018T14:41:31,TheGamePlayer,And I'm pretty darn Shure I used the account associated with my Microsoft account
30-06-2018T14:41:33,Bgrmystr2,"but if it's a used copy, they don't cover shit no matter where you buy it"
30-06-2018T14:41:49,TheGamePlayer,They were pre-order
30-06-2018T14:42:06,Mippy,Everyone have your stream tea reddy? (stream tea can be anything you happen to be drinking while stream is happening)
30-06-2018T14:42:13,Bgrmystr2,then you should be fine
30-06-2018T14:42:32,Twokinds,"Okay, I've ordered some groceries, they're supposed to arrive between 4:30 and 5:30 so I'll have to take a 5 min break when it does."
30-06-2018T14:42:59,Bgrmystr2,"""ordered groceries"" jeez man"
30-06-2018T14:43:12,Bgrmystr2,you don't even go out to the store and buy them physically like the rest of us?
30-06-2018T14:43:21,Mippy,You can order groceries? 0_o
30-06-2018T14:43:22,Twokinds,"Eh, it's raining."
30-06-2018T14:43:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,never leave the house
30-06-2018T14:43:27,Bgrmystr2,the man's living in the future..
30-06-2018T14:43:36,Twokinds,I needed some milk and eggs and snacks for the stream!
30-06-2018T14:43:39,Bgrmystr2,where apparently people melt in the rain
30-06-2018T14:43:44,Bgrmystr2,not sure if want
30-06-2018T14:43:48,Twokinds,The milk and eggs are not for the stream.

30-06-2018T14:44:37,Twokinds,I WAS going to go out for snacks. But it just started raining when I was getting ready to go out.
30-06-2018T14:44:39,Mippy,"You mean you don't have eggs, bacon, and milk for stream? My minde is blown"
30-06-2018T14:44:41,TheGamePlayer,Can I has bacon?
30-06-2018T14:44:49,Twokinds,So I was just said eh nevermind
30-06-2018T14:45:28,Twokinds,A lot of grocery stores are now doing delivery to compete with Amazon. I love it.

30-06-2018T14:51:55,iliar,"Hm... ""not stingy with the spicy powder""... It sounds delicious. I do not like very spicy food. It's painful and not tasty. But hey, if you call your product ""Super Extra Hot"" and I can eat it without frozen toilet paper - you're a liar."

30-06-2018T14:52:50,Twokinds,"I just think they taste very good, and have just the right amount. But then again I'm not really a great judge."
30-06-2018T14:53:08,Dimensional,"Heh. His Honor, The Judge Tom."

30-06-2018T14:53:30,Twokinds,They're great though. I wish I could just order the powder by itself.
30-06-2018T14:53:36,Bgrmystr2,"I like my food to taste good, not burn my damned taste buds off."
30-06-2018T14:53:39,Twokinds,I'd but an entire tub of the stuff.

30-06-2018T15:59:38,Bgrmystr2,"FYI there is no soft Z, Cheese"
30-06-2018T15:59:42,CheeseRS,Let's do it now.
30-06-2018T15:59:46,ZephyrTWolffox,Weddings are overrated

30-06-2018T16:00:05,CheeseRS,Guess my teacher was a dummy then
30-06-2018T16:00:07,ItsActuallyKopyKat,there's a reason everything with wedding in the name
30-06-2018T16:00:13,ItsActuallyKopyKat,is about 3x more expensive
30-06-2018T16:00:16,Combak,"Especially since people will want it to be in... Shit, where are they all heading?"
30-06-2018T16:00:19,ThingsAreMoving,Red Wedding
30-06-2018T16:00:31,Bgrmystr2,"Z is not a vowel. There are two general pronunciations of it, but neither is soft nor hard."

30-06-2018T16:06:53,TheGamakazi,It was proably meant to be more of a one night thing in the comic rather than a comitted relationship
30-06-2018T16:06:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,that would be fun actually
30-06-2018T16:07:12,unsteddyphoenix,i doubt theyl ever be shown again in the main comic lol

30-06-2018T23:38:59,TheFDdriver,lol what?
30-06-2018T23:39:22,Dadrobit,"Defo a he. I hypothesized early on that he was using enchanted garb to stem ""urges"". Still think it's a viable option tbh."
30-06-2018T23:39:42,Bgrmystr2,Got it. http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/577/
30-06-2018T23:39:57,SpazztasticKiwi,But why have it done at all if it’s a matter of self control
30-06-2018T23:40:01,Dadrobit,"I mean, if you can hide trans-dimensional portals in cloth wraps..."
30-06-2018T23:40:05,Bgrmystr2,"""He has"""
30-06-2018T23:40:50,Dadrobit,"And if it's just an enchantment in the clothes, then it's easy to pass off on to the next person for the job when you're done."
30-06-2018T23:40:52,FenceEqualizer,Because eastern Basitin get way to flustered to easily
30-06-2018T23:40:56,Dadrobit,And opens the field to the females.
30-06-2018T23:41:05,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, I doubt the clothes are enchanted"
30-06-2018T23:41:07,Bgrmystr2,that's still magic
30-06-2018T23:41:15,Bgrmystr2,and that would probably hurt them in some way
30-06-2018T23:41:21,Bgrmystr2,considering the tower.. yeah
30-06-2018T23:41:38,Dadrobit,"Using magic hurts them, but I don't see why wearing enchanted clothing would have the same effect."
30-06-2018T23:41:47,Bgrmystr2,being so close to it
30-06-2018T23:41:56,Dadrobit,"It's not like it's drawing from his own power, it's just doing its thing."
30-06-2018T23:42:03,TheFDdriver,the can use crystals..Right?
30-06-2018T23:42:17,Bgrmystr2,they can't use magic
30-06-2018T23:42:19,Dadrobit,Using crystals was detrimental.
30-06-2018T23:42:21,Bgrmystr2,it's keidran that use the crystals
30-06-2018T23:42:39,Bgrmystr2,"it's probably not just magic spells that would do damage to them, I think that Basitins are weak to magic itself"
30-06-2018T23:42:54,TheFDdriver,or learning magic
30-06-2018T23:43:15,Dadrobit,They're resistant to lesser magics.
30-06-2018T23:44:07,Dadrobit,"Though an old circa 07-08 post by Tom said that they resistant to most magic, but what makes it through does extra damage."
30-06-2018T23:44:17,Dadrobit,Lemme see if I can't find it.
30-06-2018T23:44:43,FenceEqualizer,Swore he said that in stream also.
30-06-2018T23:44:45,Bgrmystr2,"well, maybe if you see if you could find it, that would be.. more useful. :P"
30-06-2018T23:45:42,Dadrobit,"Oh, heck, this was just a few years ago, nvm. https://www.twokinds.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=810393#p810393"
30-06-2018T23:47:15,Dadrobit,The enchantment could just be one of those lesser magics. It's not like it's completely fool-proof as we see it get foiled at the sight of Keith/Nat kissing on the beach.
30-06-2018T23:47:20,Bgrmystr2,'just a few years ago' 14 years XD
30-06-2018T23:47:32,TheFDdriver,lol
30-06-2018T23:47:40,Bgrmystr2,it would have to affect him though
30-06-2018T23:47:40,FenceEqualizer,Which caused Lynn to sucker punch the people around
30-06-2018T23:48:08,Bgrmystr2,"if it's strong enough to affect him, it would also act negatively"
30-06-2018T23:48:19,TheFDdriver,"wouldn't Lynn be a ""special"" Basitin"
30-06-2018T23:48:34,Dadrobit,Not necessarily bgr..
30-06-2018T23:48:53,Bgrmystr2,considering that's basically what the post says o.O
30-06-2018T23:49:16,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, it's much more likely that Lynn was just 'helped' into a state where he just doesn't see anyone that way anymore."
30-06-2018T23:49:19,Dadrobit,"If it's just one of those ""practically no effect whatsoever"" spells, then it could just be tuned to do it's work and move on."
30-06-2018T23:49:58,Bgrmystr2,"he'd still have urges though, and in their line of work, one misstep is unacceptable. They are basitins after all"
30-06-2018T23:50:07,Dadrobit,And it's not like he'll be wearing it 24/7. Likely they'd just be intended to wear it for work and be done.
30-06-2018T23:50:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe he doesn’t find anyone attractive yet
30-06-2018T23:50:34,TheFDdriver,he got a complement
30-06-2018T23:50:38,Bgrmystr2,I'm just not buyin it.
30-06-2018T23:50:53,SpazztasticKiwi,There may be more in the future
30-06-2018T23:50:55,Dadrobit,"You don't have to buy it, the royal coffers are more than deep enough."
30-06-2018T23:51:12,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
30-06-2018T23:51:15,Bgrmystr2,"You say that, but when it was talked about in the comic, Lynn implied it was a permanant thing, so."
30-06-2018T23:51:18,Dadrobit,"Also, still holding that his love for the king helps as well."
30-06-2018T23:51:18,FenceEqualizer,Still think it's as simple as him being asexual. \shrug
30-06-2018T23:51:30,Bgrmystr2,"possibly, fence"
30-06-2018T23:51:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Not everything has to be understood completely
30-06-2018T23:51:34,Dadrobit,"Well, yeah, age is kind of permanent."
30-06-2018T23:51:45,FenceEqualizer,Get that fanfic out of here robit. :ptv-laugh:
30-06-2018T23:51:56,Bgrmystr2,xD dunno why age has anything to do with it
30-06-2018T23:52:12,Dadrobit,"You'll understand in a few years when you start to ""droop""."
30-06-2018T23:52:33,FenceEqualizer,The golden years
30-06-2018T23:52:46,SpazztasticKiwi,More like the grey years
30-06-2018T23:53:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Silver Status
30-06-2018T23:53:11,Bgrmystr2,"I know people in their 70s who do stuff w/o help, so eh"
30-06-2018T23:53:15,Dadrobit,"You'll see, Fence! You'll all see when I'm right and he comes out to be Maddie's father!"
30-06-2018T23:53:32,Bgrmystr2,"dadro, I think you may have taken the crazy train this morning"
30-06-2018T23:53:45,SpazztasticKiwi,*insert maniacal laughter*
30-06-2018T23:54:17,FenceEqualizer,If that happens I will buy you a beer
30-06-2018T23:54:24,TheFDdriver,but i got to admit. thats a good theory dadro
30-06-2018T23:54:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m going off to bed. You have fun with your droopy discussion
30-06-2018T23:55:04,TheFDdriver,Gnight Kiwi

30-06-2018T23:56:44,Dadrobit,They got a blush. And it only took one more push with some PDA to get him riley.
30-06-2018T23:57:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"So is it that testosterone is what keeps the ears up, or........"
30-06-2018T23:57:33,Bgrmystr2,probably
30-06-2018T23:57:40,Bgrmystr2,"it's a euphemism, har har"
30-06-2018T23:57:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Noted
30-06-2018T23:57:52,TheFDdriver,he can manipulate his feelings?
30-06-2018T23:57:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah. Caught that

30-06-2018T23:58:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though if it was a euphemism for...what I want to guess, everyone’s walking around hot n heavy"
30-06-2018T23:58:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"But nm. I need sleep, so laters"
