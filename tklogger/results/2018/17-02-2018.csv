17-02-2018T00:30:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I did see someone I graduated with today. Still buff as ever
17-02-2018T00:33:49,Unenlagia,I likely won't be sleeping for a few hours
17-02-2018T00:34:30,SpazztasticKiwi,You may be in a different time zone

17-02-2018T12:53:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Yesterday night we had someone walk out on us
17-02-2018T12:55:18,Twokinds,walk out?
17-02-2018T12:57:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Leave without completing their job
17-02-2018T12:58:10,Twokinds,Oh I thought you meant like a dine and dash
17-02-2018T12:58:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though she did some of what she was supposed to, she left some stuff and held did others"
17-02-2018T12:59:14,Twokinds,That's a shame.
17-02-2018T12:59:39,BluePhantom90,could be worst
17-02-2018T13:00:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"It is, and I can understand her frustration; I was alone in spurts that day too"
17-02-2018T13:01:15,BluePhantom90,btw Tom been wanting to ask some more questions of Twokinds.
17-02-2018T13:01:34,BluePhantom90,sorry to hear SpazztasticKiwi
17-02-2018T13:02:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"She came in as my replacement, and she was there her full time, 6-10"
17-02-2018T13:04:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"It‚Äôs just that while I was alone as the morning cook and employee in spurts from 9-3:45, and completely alone 3:45-6"
17-02-2018T13:04:50,SpazztasticKiwi,She was alone - closing - her full time. Someone from produce did offer help though
17-02-2018T13:05:29,Twokinds,brb
17-02-2018T13:07:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"I just wonder what they‚Äôre going to do about it. We‚Äôve been shorthanded, and that‚Äôs why it happened, but ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
17-02-2018T13:08:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"We‚Äôll await with anticipation, Tom for your return"
17-02-2018T13:18:12,BluePhantom90,yes
17-02-2018T13:18:43,BluePhantom90,-stretches- Besides what happen how was your day Spazz?
17-02-2018T13:20:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Tiring of course. Though I did have an interesting conversation with a customer that came for his little girl‚Äôs birthday cake
17-02-2018T13:20:59,BluePhantom90,oh?
17-02-2018T13:22:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"His wife went to get a buggy to hold the cake (it was 2 their, lots of decoration -$63)"
17-02-2018T13:23:14,SpazztasticKiwi,And he says ‚Äúthe things we do for our kids‚Äù. I told him I don‚Äôt have kids - I just have cats
17-02-2018T13:25:21,SpazztasticKiwi,And kids are out of the question for me since two are technically required for that and I‚Äôm single. It‚Äôs a conversation I have now and then ‚Äúhave kids?/when will you have them?‚Äù
17-02-2018T13:44:15,MidnightBlue78,I never understood why people always ask these questions
17-02-2018T13:44:32,UnknownEnd,Well I'm up
17-02-2018T13:45:12,MidnightBlue78,It's none of my business if you procreate or not
17-02-2018T13:45:21,MidnightBlue78,Or when you decide to do so
17-02-2018T13:45:29,MidnightBlue78,I dont even care
17-02-2018T13:46:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm just a little freaked about there being another HUMAN growing inside me for 9 months
17-02-2018T13:47:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"And kids just don‚Äôt appeal to me. What do they say to that though? ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôll change‚Äù"
17-02-2018T13:50:17,MidnightBlue78,"well, not everyone wants to have kids"
17-02-2018T13:50:23,MidnightBlue78,And thats ok
17-02-2018T13:50:40,MidnightBlue78,"I have 2, unplanned and it is tough"
17-02-2018T13:51:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"If the guy I marry wants a kid, I‚Äôm going to be sure I‚Äôm ready because I don‚Äôt want to risk messing it up"
17-02-2018T13:51:38,MidnightBlue78,"We always mess up, one way or another, we always mess up"
17-02-2018T13:53:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I just know my mom is dying for grandchildren
17-02-2018T13:54:09,SpazztasticKiwi,And I can‚Äôt be the only one in that position either

17-02-2018T13:55:50,Bgrmystr2,goddamn you guys wake up so early
17-02-2018T13:55:52,Bgrmystr2,;/
17-02-2018T13:56:11,SpazztasticKiwi,How‚Äôs it? We‚Äôre waiting for Tom. He left for a few about an hour ago and hasn‚Äôt popped back in yet
17-02-2018T13:56:29,Bgrmystr2,Yes I saw
17-02-2018T13:56:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I just made breakfast üç≥
17-02-2018T13:57:02,BluePhantom90,Its 1:56pm for me
17-02-2018T13:57:06,Bgrmystr2,it's too early for me to be hungry
17-02-2018T13:57:18,Bgrmystr2,it's just before 1pm atm
17-02-2018T13:57:26,Bgrmystr2,way too early for this shit ;&lt;
17-02-2018T13:57:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Stomach not awake yet
17-02-2018T13:57:38,Bgrmystr2,nothing awake yet
17-02-2018T13:58:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"I know how that feels. I‚Äôm not old by any standard, but it‚Äôs weird when you stand up and you hear things pop"
17-02-2018T13:58:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Makes me feel like a glow stick
17-02-2018T14:06:57,BluePhantom90,I take Tom is going over the sketch idea's
17-02-2018T14:08:18,Dinoman515,Maybe...
17-02-2018T14:09:02,Twokinds,"""gets turned into a Kristen"""
17-02-2018T14:10:05,Dinoman515,^w^ Hi Tom!
17-02-2018T14:10:41,Dinoman515,"How are you doing? Good, I hope!"
17-02-2018T14:12:09,Twokinds,I'm doing well thanks
17-02-2018T14:12:47,BluePhantom90,well is it alright to ask the questions Tom?
17-02-2018T14:13:05,Dinoman515,Good to hear!
17-02-2018T14:13:06,Twokinds,No before the stream is not a good time.
17-02-2018T14:13:18,Twokinds,It's like the one time I'm really busy
17-02-2018T14:13:26,BluePhantom90,alright alright
17-02-2018T14:13:29,Dinoman515,Makes sense.
17-02-2018T14:13:32,ThingsAreMoving,o/
17-02-2018T14:13:34,Twokinds,"Of course if you just ask, maybe I'll answer"
17-02-2018T14:15:34,BluePhantom90,hmm Well it an be yes or no answers just talking about characters with strong magic. I mean Raine and Her father were stong with it. Could there be more people out there with Strong magic like them?
17-02-2018T14:16:04,Twokinds,Yeah abviously
17-02-2018T14:16:39,BluePhantom90,heh like OP with magic just not the control?
17-02-2018T14:16:44,Dinoman515,Just look at Trace... Lol
17-02-2018T14:17:01,Twokinds,Maybe? I don't know
17-02-2018T14:17:34,BluePhantom90,lol alright
17-02-2018T14:20:48,BluePhantom90,"Hmm well another yes or no ( or maybe), Since Your story dose take place in a time where Humanity has been getting more creative. Could Humans managed to create inventions to make or artificial magic crystals or generate them in caves like Dragons. ("
17-02-2018T14:21:20,Dinoman515,Like a Crystal Fabricator..?
17-02-2018T14:21:34,Terramaster20209,hello o/
17-02-2018T14:21:51,ThingsAreMoving,o/
17-02-2018T14:21:54,Dinoman515,o/
17-02-2018T14:22:19,BluePhantom90,something like that. I kinda came up with a idea of Weaving magic to form crystals. BUT they are not as good as the originals
17-02-2018T14:23:03,Dinoman515,Than why would you consider doing so..?
17-02-2018T14:23:18,Dinoman515,If they aren't as powerful.
17-02-2018T14:23:19,BluePhantom90,-shrugs- ask if its possible in Toms world
17-02-2018T14:24:01,ThingsAreMoving,"same like with books, make magic more accessible i suppose"
17-02-2018T14:24:06,BluePhantom90,Oh Well they can be made quickly and easy then having to wait for a dragon to lay in a cave for some time for the crystals to form
17-02-2018T14:25:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"Like sugar vs Splenda, one is produced to satisfy the needs/wants of those inable or unwilling to wait or get the other"
17-02-2018T14:25:18,BluePhantom90,yes
17-02-2018T14:26:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Because that would introduce the concept of people growing greedy (not that this doesn‚Äôt already exist)
17-02-2018T14:26:23,BluePhantom90,Or how Pepsi and Coke used to be made with Sugar but it as cheaper to use Corn syrup
17-02-2018T14:27:24,BluePhantom90,no just r-r well its a characters Family just getting initiative. I mean some people came with idea's far ahead of their time
17-02-2018T14:28:10,BluePhantom90,Why would people in Twokinds just stick to the limits and not push pass them.
17-02-2018T14:29:52,BluePhantom90,I mean there are Fireworks in Twokinds. Even the Chinese tested the Idea of turning Fireworks into weapons.
17-02-2018T14:29:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Greed. The obsession with self-advantacement and survival
17-02-2018T14:29:56,ThingsAreMoving,"Well I't been stated, that humans have the ability to grow mana crystals in TK world"
17-02-2018T14:30:01,ThingsAreMoving,http://cdn.twokinds.keenspot.com/comics/20081107.jpg
17-02-2018T14:32:44,BluePhantom90,Hmm yeah My characters Family would have created a different idea but almost similar. just less crazy then that. Since they are drawing the magic into 1 point which we know how that ended
17-02-2018T14:35:04,ThingsAreMoving,Would make sense that there is a way to safely split that huge crystal into smaller ones
17-02-2018T14:35:53,BluePhantom90,Their family just uses a type of magic battery that draws the crystal's to it in a cave but not do the same like the towers
17-02-2018T14:36:16,ThingsAreMoving,"Wait, what family?"
17-02-2018T14:36:31,BluePhantom90,r-r fan-fic don't worry about it
17-02-2018T14:37:22,SpazztasticKiwi,r-r?
17-02-2018T14:37:39,ThingsAreMoving,"R-Rated, lol"
17-02-2018T14:38:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll leave it there then
17-02-2018T14:38:46,BluePhantom90,I wouldn't say R-rated... r-r
17-02-2018T14:40:09,BluePhantom90,all the fan-fic I am wanting to get down will be credited to Tom. I wont be like some other fan. BUT more just for storying writing since I can't draw worth shit.
17-02-2018T14:43:27,BluePhantom90,"r-r I like stories and Twokinds kinda wanted me to write, but wont be posted. just more shown to close friends or other fans that want to share."

17-02-2018T14:47:20,SpazztasticKiwi,This Nibbly thing has made me want a squirrel
17-02-2018T14:47:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Or a sugar glider
17-02-2018T14:47:46,BluePhantom90,they are a pain to care for
17-02-2018T14:48:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"I also have cats, so I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôll get one"
17-02-2018T14:48:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm happy with reptiles
17-02-2018T14:49:12,BluePhantom90,Oh you know a baby Squirrel was taken in by a mama cat
17-02-2018T14:49:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Yes. The cuteness
17-02-2018T14:50:30,BluePhantom90,the baby squirrel could purr like a cat too
17-02-2018T14:51:59,SpazztasticKiwi,They‚Äôre supposed to be able to make purring like noises
17-02-2018T14:53:21,goldgardian,"Squirrels can purr = mind, Blown"
17-02-2018T14:53:44,BluePhantom90,I could look up the video

17-02-2018T14:58:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Brought a baby bunny once too
17-02-2018T14:59:24,BluePhantom90,not killed just brought it home?
17-02-2018T14:59:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Just brought it home to the door
17-02-2018T15:00:29,SpazztasticKiwi,She‚Äôd get someone‚Äôs attention and sometimes just drop it at their feet

17-02-2018T15:13:36,BluePhantom90,I try to stick with 1 or 2. r-r That #1 mom sketch was perfect. I think the other idea I have is Flora sitting between Adira and Adelaide about their experiences having their kids
17-02-2018T15:13:38,ThingsAreMoving,Was this supposed to be a halloween costume?
17-02-2018T15:14:11,Combak,Yep.

17-02-2018T15:17:08,SpazztasticKiwi,For space exploration I think
17-02-2018T15:17:44,SomeOtherTom,If that wins go for the NASA style jet pack thing
17-02-2018T15:17:50,BluePhantom90,well they either want Space suites of The Anime eva skin tight suits
17-02-2018T15:18:04,Terramaster20209,they probably want the anime one

17-02-2018T15:21:06,BluePhantom90,I wanted to do one with King Adelaide in Labor (  blocked by a curtain) and The Basitin's made a Steel hand for her to hold. Which she crushes easy

17-02-2018T19:18:22,Xexanoth,@Prose human Reni got rejected for the first time about 3 weeks ago for being spoiler(or maybe it was even 4)
17-02-2018T19:18:23,BluePhantom90,I think it would have been less of a pain for Tom to just Draw Reni human because of Nora playing Match maker
17-02-2018T19:18:25,Bgrmystr2,We already said it was a spoiler before you asked man
17-02-2018T19:18:28,ThingsAreMoving,this was the last poll for today

17-02-2018T20:04:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm starting to think of where exactly I want to actually move
17-02-2018T20:04:53,Ordithus,There is one sketch in particular I am looking forward to &lt;3
17-02-2018T20:05:06,Tharkis,have a great evening everyone
17-02-2018T20:05:10,Tharkis,:ctharkis-earwiggle:
17-02-2018T20:05:17,Ordithus,night Tharkis!  Thanks again for the advice
17-02-2018T20:05:44,unsteddyphoenix,"Same, hopin' for the first kiss redux"
17-02-2018T20:09:42,Ordithus,I'm amazed I didn't know about this 401k loan thing.  This just got a lot easier...
17-02-2018T20:11:09,Twokinds,401k loan?
17-02-2018T20:11:54,Ordithus,"Yeah, you can loan yourself money from your 401k.  Good for buying a house."
17-02-2018T20:13:05,Twokinds,That sounds dangerous.
17-02-2018T20:13:08,Tamerlee,That's different. It's not a loan.
17-02-2018T20:13:32,Ordithus,Eh?
17-02-2018T20:13:48,Tamerlee,"You pay tax on the distribution, but not a penalty for a first-time home buyer."
17-02-2018T20:13:58,Twokinds,Ooooh
17-02-2018T20:14:02,Twokinds,I see what you're saying
17-02-2018T20:14:06,Tamerlee,Unless you're talking about general 401k loans that you can spend anything on.
17-02-2018T20:14:14,Tamerlee,(Don't take out loans against your 401k)
17-02-2018T20:14:23,Tamerlee,:)
17-02-2018T20:14:26,Ordithus,Seems I should get some advice
17-02-2018T20:14:29,Twokinds,"Yeah I was going to say, I would not take a loan out of my retirement fund."
17-02-2018T20:14:44,Tamerlee,"You pay interest on the loan, of course."
17-02-2018T20:14:49,Tamerlee,May as well just take out a mortgage.
17-02-2018T20:15:16,Ordithus,They're a bit weird.
17-02-2018T20:15:55,Terryschannel,:ctwokinds-LauraCry: i missed the stream
17-02-2018T20:16:13,Terryschannel,The end of it anyways
17-02-2018T20:17:11,Ordithus,Someone is launching fireworks.  Odd.
17-02-2018T20:17:51,Terryschannel,And i killed chat :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
17-02-2018T20:17:52,Tamerlee,People treat the 4th of July like Christmas here.
17-02-2018T20:17:57,Tamerlee,Start celebrating 3 months early
17-02-2018T20:18:04,Terryschannel,Nevermind
17-02-2018T20:19:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Around here it‚Äôs ‚Äúis that gunshots or fireworks‚Äù
17-02-2018T20:21:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Especially since a lot of people like to come out here and fart around - I live out in the woods and some people seem to think no one lives out here
17-02-2018T20:21:53,Bgrmystr2,The 4th of July is arguably a more important holiday to the US than Christmas is.
17-02-2018T20:22:02,Bgrmystr2,Even considering the origin of Christmas.
17-02-2018T20:22:08,Bgrmystr2,It's still not as important.
17-02-2018T20:22:22,unsteddyphoenix,jesus who?
17-02-2018T20:22:25,SpazztasticKiwi,People like the boom booms and doing stupid stuff
17-02-2018T20:23:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Always that one guy that thinks it‚Äôs a good idea to shoot a firework into his crotch
17-02-2018T20:23:46,Bgrmystr2,let him. The stupid genes won't be passed on :P
17-02-2018T20:23:47,unsteddyphoenix,OUt of the gene pool he goes~
17-02-2018T20:23:53,Bgrmystr2,exactly phoenix
17-02-2018T20:23:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Nothing around here that starts with ‚ÄúHey guys watch this‚Äù should happen
17-02-2018T20:24:08,Bgrmystr2,xD
17-02-2018T20:24:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Or ‚ÄúHold my beer‚Äù

17-02-2018T20:26:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve also had people try to convince me of the stupidest things. Common sense is NOT common

17-02-2018T20:32:08,Bgrmystr2,"Common sense is always good, Ord, it's just that people don't actually know what constitutes as common sense"
17-02-2018T20:32:48,Ordithus,"If common sense isn't common, then it isn't common sense, is it?"
17-02-2018T20:33:00,Terryschannel,Common sense? Never heard of it
17-02-2018T20:33:13,Bgrmystr2,"If what people call 'common sense' is not good, then it's not common sense at all."
17-02-2018T20:33:25,Bgrmystr2,"and that's obvious ord, but it doesn't help anything :P"
17-02-2018T20:33:29,Ordithus,:P
17-02-2018T20:34:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Ever met the human version of a headache?
17-02-2018T20:35:02,Bgrmystr2,Several times
17-02-2018T20:35:08,Bgrmystr2,there is no one person
17-02-2018T20:35:32,Bgrmystr2,They are Billions~ as it were. :v
17-02-2018T20:35:43,SpazztasticKiwi,How about someone so ignorant and stupid they made you just squint
17-02-2018T20:36:19,Bgrmystr2,"I don't squint really, so I dunno"
17-02-2018T20:36:22,Bgrmystr2,but if I did do so
17-02-2018T20:36:25,Bgrmystr2,then probably.
17-02-2018T20:36:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôve met one of those, and so far, he‚Äôs been the most significant"
17-02-2018T20:37:25,Bgrmystr2,You'll meet WAY more
17-02-2018T20:37:28,Bgrmystr2,trust me xD
17-02-2018T20:37:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I know - it‚Äôs a factor of life
17-02-2018T20:38:53,SpazztasticKiwi,One of those people that poke at something because they know you like it
17-02-2018T20:40:54,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:

17-02-2018T20:42:56,Ordithus,"I think kiwi means, teasing you about something you like.  Precisely because you like it."
17-02-2018T20:43:19,Terryschannel,:ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:
17-02-2018T20:43:30,Ordithus,I don't think I helped lol
17-02-2018T20:44:24,Terryschannel,I know what you mean. Its clean but it can be taken badly as well
17-02-2018T20:45:20,Ordithus,Quite
17-02-2018T20:45:24,Bgrmystr2,"If it's taken badly, they're teasing wron."
17-02-2018T20:45:26,Bgrmystr2,"wrong*, even"
17-02-2018T20:45:43,Terryschannel,Where'd tom run off too?
17-02-2018T20:45:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Dinner?
17-02-2018T20:45:54,Bgrmystr2,He said he was doing taxes after the stream
17-02-2018T20:45:59,unsteddyphoenix,Nowhere
17-02-2018T20:46:02,Bgrmystr2,he didn't say anything about after that though
17-02-2018T20:46:10,Bgrmystr2,and he's been here chatting
17-02-2018T20:46:12,unsteddyphoenix,Well it makes more sense to tease someone about somthing they like
17-02-2018T20:46:16,unsteddyphoenix,THan something they dont like
17-02-2018T20:46:31,Terryschannel,Why not both?
17-02-2018T20:46:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Or taxes. Or watching chat
17-02-2018T20:46:40,unsteddyphoenix,next level...
17-02-2018T20:49:40,SpazztasticKiwi,The kind of thing wasn‚Äôt teasing - it was racist. The kind of poking at I‚Äôm talking about is seeing you doing something or knowing you like something and making snide remarks about it
17-02-2018T20:51:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though in other news, my cat just climbed my back like a goat"
17-02-2018T20:52:00,Terryschannel,What?
17-02-2018T20:52:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"Yep, he walked himself up my back and perched himself on my shoulder blades"
17-02-2018T20:53:01,Terryschannel,Lol
17-02-2018T20:53:05,Terryschannel,Sorry
17-02-2018T20:53:12,unsteddyphoenix,&lt;333
17-02-2018T20:54:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôm not effected by it, so I‚Äôm pretty ok with it, especially now. But at the time, I got so frustrated I nearly cried"
17-02-2018T20:57:18,SpazztasticKiwi,The stupid was that strong with that one
17-02-2018T20:58:12,NightMeaty22,I had a fox do that to me
17-02-2018T20:58:26,Bgrmystr2,"You mean like, making fun of the things you like? Cuz that's not teasing"
17-02-2018T20:58:30,Bgrmystr2,that's just being shitty
17-02-2018T20:59:01,Bgrmystr2,"Teasing will never have malicious intent, or it's not a tease."
17-02-2018T20:59:30,Bgrmystr2,There's a line there.
17-02-2018T21:00:10,NightMeaty22,I had i fox climb on to my shoulders is what i am saying no need to be an ass
17-02-2018T21:00:32,unsteddyphoenix,No...you can make fun of something someone likes in an innocuous way
17-02-2018T21:00:54,unsteddyphoenix,It's about whether or not the person respects your interests and if theyre trying to make you feel bad or not
17-02-2018T21:01:11,unsteddyphoenix,The subject is barely relevant imo
17-02-2018T21:01:49,Bgrmystr2,"Making fun of someone is never innocuous. If you're making fun of something, that always has the intent of putting it down and making that person feel bad about it."
17-02-2018T21:02:26,unsteddyphoenix,"in this context ""making fun"" and ""teasing"" are interchangable"
17-02-2018T21:02:43,Bgrmystr2,The two are completely different
17-02-2018T21:03:32,NightMeaty22,They can mean the same thing tho
17-02-2018T21:03:39,Bgrmystr2,I disagree
17-02-2018T21:03:40,unsteddyphoenix,"Honestly, not really. Just one has negative connotations attached"
17-02-2018T21:04:01,Terryschannel,There's only one way to find out. Who's the tease tester?
17-02-2018T21:04:54,Bgrmystr2,"That won't change anything, Terry. It's more about the definition itself"
17-02-2018T21:05:00,Bgrmystr2,which is open to interpretation
17-02-2018T21:06:20,unsteddyphoenix,"In any case, the point is there's a difference between ""haha I bet you like this 'cause youre a furry :ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:"" and ""Furries are so gross why do you even like that, weirdo :ctwokinds-flomad:"
17-02-2018T21:06:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"How about if the person your teasing becomes uncomfortable or truly upset (either on the angry side or the sad side), you don‚Äôt do it"
17-02-2018T21:06:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Good definition?
17-02-2018T21:07:38,Bgrmystr2,"I don't see much of a difference, phoenix, considering the first one would probably end with ""Fucking loser' or something"
17-02-2018T21:07:51,unsteddyphoenix,Youre projecting a bit there bgr
17-02-2018T21:07:59,Terryschannel,"Let's not do this to each other. Just to be safe though, im leaving early. Goodnight"
17-02-2018T21:08:13,Bgrmystr2,how am I projecting?
17-02-2018T21:08:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Night night sleep sleep
17-02-2018T21:08:22,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering:
17-02-2018T21:08:40,NightMeaty22,Good night terry
17-02-2018T21:08:47,Bgrmystr2,Gnight Terry
17-02-2018T21:09:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Ever notice that when you repeat words it becomes baby talk
17-02-2018T21:09:48,Bgrmystr2,"I just don't see much of a difference other than the first one looking down on you, while the latter is just disgusted in general."
17-02-2018T21:09:55,Bgrmystr2,both are bad.
17-02-2018T21:11:20,unsteddyphoenix,"In the first example, the person is teasing you 'cause they know youre interested in it and are trying to relate in a humorous manner, the second one is actively trying to make you feel bad and hurt your feelings with a snide remark."
17-02-2018T21:11:43,NightMeaty22,Agreed
17-02-2018T21:11:43,Bgrmystr2,"That's not even remotely teasing, the fuck xD"
17-02-2018T21:11:50,unsteddyphoenix,"The ""fucking loser"" that you added, is all in your head. You might interpret it that way, but they didnt even intend it."
17-02-2018T21:11:54,unsteddyphoenix,Thats how youre projecting.
17-02-2018T21:12:38,Bgrmystr2,"You can tell me that, but I don't think so."
17-02-2018T21:12:56,Bgrmystr2,"Considering I've had people do that very thing to me, I actually learned the hard way"
17-02-2018T21:12:58,unsteddyphoenix,Ok then.
17-02-2018T21:13:07,Bgrmystr2,"people are shitty, and it's not just in my head lol"
17-02-2018T21:13:28,unsteddyphoenix,"They are shitty, but it seems like it might be more in your head than you realise."
17-02-2018T21:13:41,unsteddyphoenix,"In any case, i'm always right, so lets move on."
17-02-2018T21:13:53,Ordithus,lol
17-02-2018T21:13:59,Bgrmystr2,You're right. It was in my head that they told me directly to my face that I was a loser.
17-02-2018T21:14:06,Bgrmystr2,I dunno how words work :D
17-02-2018T21:14:15,Bgrmystr2,:thumbsup:
17-02-2018T21:15:16,unsteddyphoenix,It's very apparent.
17-02-2018T21:15:24,unsteddyphoenix,Considering how hard you missed the point.
17-02-2018T21:15:31,NightMeaty22,Same happens to me and i have no friends
17-02-2018T21:15:49,unsteddyphoenix,D'aw.
17-02-2018T21:16:04,Bgrmystr2,"I didn't miss the point, I just think it's wrong. Because I've actually experienced what you're telling me didn't actually happen."
17-02-2018T21:16:07,Ordithus,"Night, was this fox domesticated?"
17-02-2018T21:16:50,NightMeaty22,Sorta
17-02-2018T21:17:32,Ordithus,"So, just tame?  Like it was raised from a kit."
17-02-2018T21:17:42,Ordithus,Adorable either way
17-02-2018T21:18:18,NightMeaty22,Like that
17-02-2018T21:19:09,NightMeaty22,But not complety tame
17-02-2018T21:20:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve heard that somewhere they‚Äôre breeding/selling ‚Äúdomesticated‚Äù foxes that are ‚Äúlike cats‚Äù
17-02-2018T21:20:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Am I the only one that sees problems?
17-02-2018T21:21:04,unsteddyphoenix,Thats pretty cute. Just hope it's not like what they did to dogs.
17-02-2018T21:21:09,Ordithus,I believe they are super expensive
17-02-2018T21:21:31,Ordithus,Bred in the USSR as an experiment
17-02-2018T21:21:45,unsteddyphoenix,"If they literally mean like, the size of cats then that's pretty worrying."
17-02-2018T21:23:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt know - my main thing is people that‚Äôll buy one and get bored after awhile like they do with cats and dogs
17-02-2018T21:24:04,unsteddyphoenix,those people shouldnt have pets
17-02-2018T21:24:45,SpazztasticKiwi,They shouldn‚Äôt but not much stops them from it
17-02-2018T21:25:20,NightMeaty22,Foxes are crazy hiper all the time so i dont think you can get borwd
17-02-2018T21:25:28,NightMeaty22,Bored*
17-02-2018T21:25:46,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôll cause another portion of people who buy them to want to get rid of them
17-02-2018T21:26:39,NightMeaty22,That is what happens they dont have the amount of room for them to play

17-02-2018T21:33:47,DarthRexKing,What was unsteady saying about you missing a point and something happening to you despite not having friends? I missed everything before that. XD
17-02-2018T21:34:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom you sound like you need a vacation
17-02-2018T21:34:19,NightMeaty22,Sorry my comment lagged back there

17-02-2018T21:34:42,BluePhantom90,alright throwing that on the list
17-02-2018T21:35:01,NightMeaty22,I was saying i have no friends because people cant accept me
17-02-2018T21:35:12,NightMeaty22,For who i am

17-02-2018T21:37:38,Bgrmystr2,"Rex, that was two different people you're combining into one"
17-02-2018T21:38:00,Bgrmystr2,I wasn't mad at anyone xD
17-02-2018T21:39:00,NightMeaty22,Sorry it just looked like that
17-02-2018T21:39:25,unsteddyphoenix,bgr no bully pls D:
17-02-2018T21:39:30,Bgrmystr2,I don't even think i had said anything to you Night
17-02-2018T21:39:39,Bgrmystr2,"lol Phoenix, coming from you :ptv-laugh:"
17-02-2018T21:40:01,Bgrmystr2,just a little funny
17-02-2018T21:40:02,unsteddyphoenix,What a snide remark~
17-02-2018T21:40:14,Bgrmystr2,ohnoes
17-02-2018T21:40:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Y‚Äôall just some terrible people üòù
17-02-2018T21:40:38,Bgrmystr2,"mmm, some of us."
17-02-2018T21:41:22,unsteddyphoenix,same
17-02-2018T21:41:45,Bgrmystr2,lol you can see the arrows pointing at each other ^
17-02-2018T21:42:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"Oh, I don‚Äôt know if your Walmarts have it up yet, but we‚Äôre getting new displays"
17-02-2018T21:42:36,Bgrmystr2,that sounds like a local thing
17-02-2018T21:42:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"St Patrick‚Äôs day on the left, Easter on the right"
17-02-2018T21:43:01,Bgrmystr2,"ahh, I thought you meant like tv displays or something like that"
17-02-2018T21:43:15,SpazztasticKiwi,They wasted no time
17-02-2018T21:44:47,NightMeaty22,Walmart needs one thing at a time
17-02-2018T21:45:01,SpazztasticKiwi,My theory on why there‚Äôs never anyone at the registers is that everyone else is taking down the last display and putting up the new ones
17-02-2018T21:45:38,NightMeaty22,Brb
17-02-2018T21:48:12,NightMeaty22,Back
17-02-2018T21:48:28,NightMeaty22,Rip chat
17-02-2018T21:49:35,BluePhantom90,heh just thinking
17-02-2018T21:51:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm jumping back and forth from YouTube
17-02-2018T21:53:03,BluePhantom90,"It is annoying how You Tom put all the Feline Keidran further off from the Tigers, with the Tigers being the Dominate race with tons of Land, Besides the Snow leopards but you put on the map it ""was their territory"""
17-02-2018T21:56:18,BluePhantom90,wonder what happen to it
17-02-2018T21:57:09,BluePhantom90,hhmmm yeah kinda dead now
17-02-2018T21:57:28,unsteddyphoenix,did anyone understand that?
17-02-2018T21:57:32,Ordithus,:skull_crossbones:
17-02-2018T21:58:23,SpazztasticKiwi,üßü‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
17-02-2018T21:59:32,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering:
17-02-2018T21:59:59,Bgrmystr2,sounds like resounding 'no'
17-02-2018T22:00:06,BluePhantom90,what?
17-02-2018T22:01:09,Bgrmystr2,and now we're all on the same page.
17-02-2018T22:01:43,BluePhantom90,what on the territory?
17-02-2018T22:03:19,PalmettoPathfinder1,Wow.  This brings back a lot of great memories.
17-02-2018T22:03:21,PalmettoPathfinder1,http://guardian.battleon.com/Build30/charview.asp?temp=784769
17-02-2018T22:03:45,BluePhantom90,oh god
17-02-2018T22:03:51,PalmettoPathfinder1,What?
17-02-2018T22:04:48,BluePhantom90,I remember this game
17-02-2018T22:05:02,PalmettoPathfinder1,I loved this game.  Got hugely addicted to it when I was in college.
17-02-2018T22:06:07,BluePhantom90,yeah when I was in highschool
17-02-2018T22:06:22,PalmettoPathfinder1,Oh?  What's your character?  Or characters?
17-02-2018T22:06:46,BluePhantom90,oh god its been forever
17-02-2018T22:07:42,Bgrmystr2,I don't even know what that is
17-02-2018T22:08:14,PalmettoPathfinder1,"It's an online game where you create a character, go on quests, and fight evil!  I mean ebil!"
17-02-2018T22:08:39,BluePhantom90,yeah just a really really old game
17-02-2018T22:10:12,PalmettoPathfinder1,"What Blue said.  I discovered it back in 2004, and I've played for 10 years.  Then, life got in the way and I haven't played it or the other games like Mechquest, Warpforce, etc. in 4 years."
17-02-2018T22:11:02,BluePhantom90,Its been like 8 or 9 years since I played
17-02-2018T22:14:45,PalmettoPathfinder1,I see.  Still an awesome game.  I think you should play it Bgr.
17-02-2018T22:16:50,Bgrmystr2,meh
17-02-2018T22:16:57,Bgrmystr2,I never got into those kindsa games
17-02-2018T22:17:37,PalmettoPathfinder1,Oh?  How come?
17-02-2018T22:17:53,qwe304,i played poptropica
17-02-2018T22:18:16,Bgrmystr2,"It's all text-based and stuff, yeah?"
17-02-2018T22:18:20,Bgrmystr2,didn't get into that
17-02-2018T22:22:58,PalmettoPathfinder1,"No.  Not text based.  Click.  You click a button whether it be a spell, an ability, a pet (yes, you can sic war dogs, baby dragons, ninja kittens, ponies, and robotigers on enemies), or skills and you watch as your characters does the ability."
17-02-2018T22:23:21,BluePhantom90,think final fantasy turn base
17-02-2018T22:23:34,PalmettoPathfinder1,What blue said.
17-02-2018T22:26:44,Bgrmystr2,superpass.
17-02-2018T22:26:51,PalmettoPathfinder1,Why?
17-02-2018T22:26:55,PalmettoPathfinder1,Out of curiosity.
17-02-2018T22:27:36,Bgrmystr2,"Don't really like turn-based games, nor do I like mechanics that games like FF use, Praying to the RNG gods and such"
17-02-2018T22:27:44,Bgrmystr2,it's all a matter of luck
17-02-2018T22:27:45,Bgrmystr2,not skill
17-02-2018T22:28:10,Bgrmystr2,"putting together the most ideal or best setup is a matter of numbers, not a matter of player reaction time or ability"
17-02-2018T22:28:21,Bgrmystr2,so I don't like games like that
17-02-2018T22:28:23,BluePhantom90,yeah I kinda got tired of it long ago
17-02-2018T22:28:42,Bgrmystr2,"Given enough time, anyone can be ""good"" at a numbers game"
17-02-2018T22:28:44,Bgrmystr2,it's a numbers game.
17-02-2018T22:28:49,Bgrmystr2,that's not fun
17-02-2018T22:30:20,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, I think I got hooked because of the story (and the humor was really good).  I mean I learned what ebil was."
17-02-2018T22:33:14,PalmettoPathfinder1,"I see.  Well, still it does bring back memories, ones that I enjoyed.  Heck I named one of my pets on there after a kitten that I loved dearly.  Sadly Sambo died of feline respiratory inflammation."
17-02-2018T22:33:30,PalmettoPathfinder1,I named that pet on AQ in memory of my beloved pet.
17-02-2018T22:49:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Anyone want to play would you rather
17-02-2018T22:49:36,BluePhantom90,eh
17-02-2018T22:51:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"Would you rather be lost in a forest or lost in the ocean (no phones, compass, map, etc)"
17-02-2018T22:53:35,Bgrmystr2,I'd rather go eat
17-02-2018T22:53:37,Bgrmystr2,:D
17-02-2018T22:53:54,PalmettoPathfinder1,Well y'all have a good night.
17-02-2018T22:54:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"Eat what? Sonic, McDonald‚Äôs, Jack‚Äôs, Wendy‚Äôs...?"
17-02-2018T22:54:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Nite
17-02-2018T22:54:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Of course there‚Äôs also places like Cracker Barrel and red lobster
17-02-2018T22:56:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve been to Cracker Barrel once.
17-02-2018T22:57:47,Bgrmystr2,none of the above
17-02-2018T22:57:58,Bgrmystr2,not going out to eat at 10pm
17-02-2018T22:59:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Snacks are better at that time of night
17-02-2018T23:06:10,Bgrmystr2,"nope, made me food"
17-02-2018T23:06:24,Bgrmystr2,was about time I did that anyway
17-02-2018T23:06:57,unsteddyphoenix,I cant imagine anyone would pick the ocean :thinking:
17-02-2018T23:10:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Many types of people out there
17-02-2018T23:11:19,unsteddyphoenix,"Including people who like to drown, I guess. Fair."
17-02-2018T23:11:47,Ordithus,"Yeah, I'll take the woods for 500, Trebek."
17-02-2018T23:20:09,SpazztasticKiwi,First aid and survival training can get you far
17-02-2018T23:20:19,TheBeckoner,Interesting article on the foxes. Also Im back
17-02-2018T23:20:29,Twokinds,"I've been playing Subnautica the last week, so I've spent a lot of time lost in the ocean recently."
17-02-2018T23:20:37,Ordithus,"Yeah, it was a neat read Beck"
17-02-2018T23:21:08,TheBeckoner,"I really like the dudes commitment to the work, and the fact that it's still goin."
17-02-2018T23:21:10,unsteddyphoenix,Heard lotta good things 'bout that game.
17-02-2018T23:21:12,BluePhantom90,Wish my computer could handle those games.
17-02-2018T23:22:13,BluePhantom90,"r-r Got it in 2013, and in tech world that is ancient."
17-02-2018T23:23:23,Ordithus,I'm currently running a mix of 2011 and 2017 hardware
17-02-2018T23:23:39,Ordithus,"CPU from '11, GPU from '17"
17-02-2018T23:23:51,TheBeckoner,^^
17-02-2018T23:23:54,TheBeckoner,Same
17-02-2018T23:24:02,BluePhantom90,well laptops are hard to update because if I took it apart it voids the warranty.
17-02-2018T23:24:07,TheBeckoner,i7-4770k with a 1080ti lol
17-02-2018T23:24:20,Ordithus,FX4100 and RX480
17-02-2018T23:24:39,Ordithus,My FX8370 was murdered by my motherboard in November
17-02-2018T23:25:21,TheBeckoner,"I could use a better cpu, but then I have to make the jump to new stuff and with that i gotta upgrade so much other stuff."
17-02-2018T23:25:27,TheBeckoner,gets $$$$ fast
17-02-2018T23:26:12,Ordithus,"If I had know the mobo took the cpu with it, I would have done that upgrade.  All I would have needed yet is memory"
17-02-2018T23:26:14,BluePhantom90,yeah I spent a lot of my cash on Commissions to get character profiles made of my characters
17-02-2018T23:26:36,TheBeckoner,Most of my money is spent on cars...
17-02-2018T23:26:40,TheBeckoner,Trucks*
17-02-2018T23:29:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I expect Subnautica will be at PAX East. They‚Äôve gained alot of ground and quite the fan base
17-02-2018T23:30:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Or at least I hope it will. It‚Äôll be something I‚Äôll recognize.
17-02-2018T23:30:45,unsteddyphoenix,I should get in on it might distract me from the HEAT.
17-02-2018T23:30:55,unsteddyphoenix,I can only seem to play one gam at a time though
17-02-2018T23:30:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"What‚Äôs your favorite creature so far, Tom?"
17-02-2018T23:31:27,TheBeckoner,Heat as in outside unsteddy?
17-02-2018T23:31:41,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah
17-02-2018T23:31:47,unsteddyphoenix,It's hella humid atm
17-02-2018T23:32:01,TheBeckoner,"We can trade spots. When its cold here we switch, I like heat more than cold."
17-02-2018T23:32:33,unsteddyphoenix,Im down
17-02-2018T23:32:37,unsteddyphoenix,Just put on more clothes
17-02-2018T23:33:12,TheBeckoner,Yeah but mah hand get all cold and painful
17-02-2018T23:33:17,TheBeckoner,hands*
17-02-2018T23:33:32,unsteddyphoenix,warm them up with INTENSE VIDEOGAMING
17-02-2018T23:33:38,TheBeckoner,idk I find myself in more pain when cold
17-02-2018T23:33:55,TheBeckoner,True. Just gotta downgrade my gpu
17-02-2018T23:34:53,unsteddyphoenix,lifehack overclock your PC to hear your room
17-02-2018T23:35:12,unsteddyphoenix,heat
17-02-2018T23:36:38,TheBeckoner,"lol I cant overclock this. It's haswell ""eco friendly"" architecture, so it literally boils the water in this cooler at ANY overclock. Must be a bad chip idk"
17-02-2018T23:36:58,TheBeckoner,like 218F
17-02-2018T23:37:05,Ordithus,Holy crap
17-02-2018T23:37:20,TheBeckoner,I got it to boot on like 4ghz but anything made it go nuts
17-02-2018T23:37:46,TheBeckoner,It works fine stock though so it lives until i decide it's too slow.
17-02-2018T23:39:36,Bgrmystr2,"Beck, maybe you should switch cooling then"
17-02-2018T23:40:07,Bgrmystr2,"There exists radiator cooling solutions for computers, might be useful to get one"
17-02-2018T23:40:19,TheBeckoner,If I do that I'm probably gonna go to different architecture.
17-02-2018T23:40:28,Bgrmystr2,yeh prolly for the best
17-02-2018T23:40:30,Bgrmystr2,but
17-02-2018T23:40:31,TheBeckoner,I have a H100i - sorta small though
17-02-2018T23:40:43,Bgrmystr2,radiators can have a lot of supported connections
17-02-2018T23:40:53,Bgrmystr2,and can be modified to support different connections as well
17-02-2018T23:41:13,TheBeckoner,I honestly think this is just a worse off chip. THere is no reason it should be SO HOT at 4ghz
17-02-2018T23:41:33,Bgrmystr2,Intel cpu? They tend to run really hot naturally
17-02-2018T23:41:41,TheBeckoner,218f?
17-02-2018T23:41:49,TheBeckoner,lol yeah but not that hot.
17-02-2018T23:42:00,Bgrmystr2,lesse
17-02-2018T23:42:10,TheBeckoner,"Im ok with some heat, just not that much."
17-02-2018T23:42:18,Bgrmystr2,that's about 103.3C
17-02-2018T23:42:24,TheBeckoner,yuuuuupppp
17-02-2018T23:42:26,TheBeckoner,toasty
17-02-2018T23:42:26,Ordithus,Could be the thermal paste
17-02-2018T23:42:27,unsteddyphoenix,Wait what
17-02-2018T23:42:37,unsteddyphoenix,Im amazed it still runs
17-02-2018T23:42:37,TheBeckoner,"I thought so too Ord, it wasnt"
17-02-2018T23:42:40,Bgrmystr2,"My computer would physically shut down to prevent damage to the components if it were that hot, Beck"
17-02-2018T23:42:43,Bgrmystr2,that's wrong
17-02-2018T23:42:55,Bgrmystr2,you need to unplug the thing and fix the cooling
17-02-2018T23:43:00,Bgrmystr2,cuz that's not how hot it's supposed to be
17-02-2018T23:43:18,TheBeckoner,"lol this was awhile ago whe I was trying to OC, now its at base."
17-02-2018T23:43:24,TheBeckoner,when*
17-02-2018T23:43:36,TheBeckoner,And yeah it blue screened a few times.
17-02-2018T23:43:43,Bgrmystr2,that'll be from the heat
17-02-2018T23:43:49,TheBeckoner,mmhhmm
17-02-2018T23:43:55,Bgrmystr2,your cooling solutions are sub-par if it gets that hot
17-02-2018T23:44:17,Bgrmystr2,definitely not made to cool that kind of overclock
17-02-2018T23:44:47,TheBeckoner,This cpu and this cooler a usually a good combo. People with the 4770k usually get 4-4.3ghz on a h100i. I belive I got a sub par chip though.
17-02-2018T23:44:52,TheBeckoner,believe*
17-02-2018T23:45:10,TheBeckoner,Also the h100i is a bit small for anything crazy
17-02-2018T23:45:24,Bgrmystr2,"I would disagree. I thinkyour cooler is what is subpar. If people get 4.3ghz on the same cooler you do, then yours is broken"
17-02-2018T23:45:36,TheBeckoner,I suppose.
17-02-2018T23:45:45,Bgrmystr2,your core will not get THAT much hotter than theirs
17-02-2018T23:46:01,Bgrmystr2,it's the cooler that makes the different in temps
17-02-2018T23:46:08,TheBeckoner,I have to spend money to find out though and this cpu aint worth it.
17-02-2018T23:46:19,Bgrmystr2,"if it's your current pc, it's worth it"
17-02-2018T23:46:25,TheBeckoner,I'll just move on to the new i5 or something.
17-02-2018T23:46:25,Bgrmystr2,"the cpu itself is worth, imo"
17-02-2018T23:46:46,Bgrmystr2,"you know, I'm still running AMD's Phenom II 955 x4"
17-02-2018T23:46:51,Bgrmystr2,it's from 2009
17-02-2018T23:46:56,Bgrmystr2,and it serves me pretty well
17-02-2018T23:47:02,Ordithus,How much heat is the radiator dumping out?  Does it seem hot?
17-02-2018T23:47:08,Bgrmystr2,so the fact that your cpu is one of intel's $1k+
17-02-2018T23:47:22,Bgrmystr2,"I think your ""not worth"" is definitely wrong on that one"
17-02-2018T23:47:49,Bgrmystr2,"it may not be worth that much anymore, but it was that price at one point."
17-02-2018T23:47:52,TheBeckoner,No the 4770k is $550
17-02-2018T23:47:55,Bgrmystr2,Yeah now
17-02-2018T23:48:09,TheBeckoner,I bought mine near that a year after it came out.
17-02-2018T23:48:18,TheBeckoner,on some crazy new egg sale
17-02-2018T23:48:57,Bgrmystr2,"Every time intel comes out with a new core, they're overpriced at $1k simply because they could price gouge and there was nothing AMD or the users could do to stop it"
17-02-2018T23:49:09,Bgrmystr2,it's different now that AMD can compete
17-02-2018T23:49:12,TheBeckoner,It's defintley warm under load at the boosted stock frequency Ord.
17-02-2018T23:49:46,TheBeckoner,I never have really considered AMD tbh
17-02-2018T23:50:31,Ordithus,I've been happy with my AMD stuff
17-02-2018T23:50:33,Bgrmystr2,"right now, AMD is kicking Inte's ass"
17-02-2018T23:50:49,Bgrmystr2,"before they came out with Ryzen, AMD had not had a foothold beyond price for power"
17-02-2018T23:50:53,TheBeckoner,Whatever renders videos better...
17-02-2018T23:51:10,Ordithus,That'll be AMD for brand new stuff
17-02-2018T23:51:28,TheBeckoner,"Yeah, they have always been much cheaper"
17-02-2018T23:51:33,TheBeckoner,very appealing
17-02-2018T23:51:38,Bgrmystr2,"AMD's Ryzen and everything above that is top-tier, intel level"
17-02-2018T23:51:57,Bgrmystr2,"and compared to intel's similar cores, they're cheaper"
17-02-2018T23:52:00,Bgrmystr2,with similar power
17-02-2018T23:52:09,Bgrmystr2,they even beat Intel at some things
17-02-2018T23:52:14,Ordithus,Nowadays
17-02-2018T23:52:49,Bgrmystr2,"AMD has higher core counts than Intel with the latest chips, so they're pushing for people using multithreaded applications"
17-02-2018T23:53:15,Bgrmystr2,"their single-thread is not as good as intel's, but single-threaded applications stopped being a primary focus several years ago"
17-02-2018T23:53:40,Bgrmystr2,Intel even botched their i9 reveal
17-02-2018T23:54:35,Bgrmystr2,I would rather off buy a Ryzen core than an intel equivilant
17-02-2018T23:55:18,TheBeckoner,so right now I'm like 54C at 25% at 3.8ghz (Game idling)
17-02-2018T23:55:23,TheBeckoner,lemme get in a game rlqk
17-02-2018T23:57:17,TheBeckoner,Now its 50C at 40% at 3.8ghz
17-02-2018T23:57:22,TheBeckoner,lil bit hotter...
17-02-2018T23:57:23,Bgrmystr2,sitting at about 57C at about 10%
17-02-2018T23:57:29,Bgrmystr2,you should be way cooler than mine is
17-02-2018T23:57:43,Bgrmystr2,Mine is air-cooled
17-02-2018T23:57:44,Bgrmystr2,stock fan.
17-02-2018T23:57:45,TheBeckoner,I said 50C but I meant 60C
17-02-2018T23:58:15,Bgrmystr2,"your CPU, when idle, should probably not be above 45C"
17-02-2018T23:58:27,Bgrmystr2,if that.
17-02-2018T23:58:28,TheBeckoner,Idle is like 42
17-02-2018T23:58:47,Bgrmystr2,then why is your high temps like 100+?
17-02-2018T23:59:04,Bgrmystr2,"it's gotta be your cooler, bro"
