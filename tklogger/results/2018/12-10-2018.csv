12-10-2018T00:55:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Nighty night sage, thanks for the streamy"
12-10-2018T00:55:53,Bgrmystr2,"oh hey, looks nice :O"
12-10-2018T00:56:15,Bgrmystr2,I don't recall the dude with the mustache?
12-10-2018T00:56:23,SageSaga,he was in one panel
12-10-2018T00:56:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,he is the true hero of AI
12-10-2018T00:56:46,SageSaga,he was the other guy to go with Relms father
12-10-2018T00:56:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,moostach
12-10-2018T00:57:26,Bgrmystr2,gonna have to look at the archives
12-10-2018T00:57:53,TheBeckoner,Thank for stream I saw bits and pieces. Nice stuff
12-10-2018T00:58:25,Bgrmystr2,sage..
12-10-2018T00:58:32,Bgrmystr2,is that infinite symbol a random page button?
12-10-2018T00:58:53,SageSaga,probably
12-10-2018T00:59:13,Bgrmystr2,knew it
12-10-2018T01:25:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m slowly reading
12-10-2018T01:25:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll understand this language eventually
12-10-2018T01:39:28,SpazztasticKiwi,And I’ll have to be there in spirit at the stream. But night night peoples
12-10-2018T01:40:37,Dadrobit,o/ Spazz
12-10-2018T05:16:33,Twokinds,Good morning!
12-10-2018T05:16:59,iliar,Good morning!
12-10-2018T05:20:15,Bgrmystr2,"mornin. It's about 5:20am Central, usually you were going to sleep around a couple hours ago"
12-10-2018T05:20:54,Bgrmystr2,what time do you plan on streaming? When sage starts? or 4pm like you do on sunday?
12-10-2018T05:24:40,Twokinds,I dunno whenever
12-10-2018T05:29:05,Dadrobit,Start now. Embrace the chaos.
12-10-2018T05:29:25,Bgrmystr2,D:
12-10-2018T05:29:31,Bgrmystr2,But I didn't sleep yet!
12-10-2018T05:30:02,Dadrobit,"Same, and I still have another 2 hours of nerd shit that I need to watch"
12-10-2018T05:32:28,iliar,I don't mind if Tom starts right now. Very convenient time if you live in a time zone +3
12-10-2018T05:33:07,unsteddyphoenix,I mean I got a few hours~
12-10-2018T05:36:06,unsteddyphoenix,You reckon you're gonna try stream with sage?
12-10-2018T05:36:51,Twokinds,lol
12-10-2018T05:36:59,Twokinds,I'm not planning to stream now I just woke up
12-10-2018T05:37:29,unsteddyphoenix,Curses
12-10-2018T05:37:37,unsteddyphoenix,I'll probably have to SLEEP then
12-10-2018T05:37:49,iliar,@Twokinds About streams. Looks like you trying work on Nora Сards on the stream. But it seems to me to work without a stream easier. So I want to say I do not mind if you will be work on my my cards at any convenient time for you.
12-10-2018T06:30:31,Twokinds,ok I'll keep that in mind
12-10-2018T06:32:37,RimaDraws,hey tom
12-10-2018T07:01:03,Twokinds,hi
12-10-2018T07:02:18,RimaDraws,hope you are feeling better
12-10-2018T07:07:16,Twokinds,"Well, sleep definitely helped."
12-10-2018T07:17:10,RimaDraws,thats always good. i woke up not long ago myself. just getting some art done.
12-10-2018T07:25:35,RimaDraws,gonna try to get at least two animations finished today
12-10-2018T07:45:17,Twokinds,"Animations, nice"
12-10-2018T07:45:25,Twokinds,I wish I had time to do animations.
12-10-2018T07:45:29,RimaDraws,yea i do some in clip studio paint. nothing fun lol
12-10-2018T07:45:35,RimaDraws,well it is fun but nothing big
12-10-2018T07:46:41,RimaDraws,im using trello to keep up with my commissions and it was recommended by a friend who says if i have trouble keeping organized it helps and it does.
12-10-2018T07:46:43,Twokinds,Heh
12-10-2018T07:46:55,Twokinds,Most of the simple animation work I do is just in Photoshop.
12-10-2018T07:47:04,Twokinds,"Definitely not ideal, but it gets the job done."
12-10-2018T07:47:12,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
12-10-2018T07:47:41,RimaDraws,i cant get the hang of photoshop at all. ive been trying to get my brushes like yours and it wont budge but i also cant afford it monthly
12-10-2018T07:47:56,RimaDraws,so sai and clip are my uses for art
12-10-2018T07:48:18,Twokinds,It has a steep learning curve for sure.
12-10-2018T07:48:39,RimaDraws,yea it does. it was hard to learn but maybe one of these days i can get back into it
12-10-2018T07:52:05,Twokinds,I've gotten so used to it I have a hard time adapting to other art programs.
12-10-2018T07:52:19,RimaDraws,see photoshop is the only one i have trouble with
12-10-2018T07:52:22,Twokinds,"I tried Clip Studio for a while, but couldn't make it stick."
12-10-2018T07:52:30,RimaDraws,everything else is adaptable but that one nope
12-10-2018T13:48:55,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-sleepy: mornin
12-10-2018T13:53:49,Bgrmystr2,hey sage
12-10-2018T13:54:32,Bgrmystr2,Made the beginning of the stream today :D
12-10-2018T13:54:55,Mippy,"Oh, hello. I just orderd some Ethiopian food. :grinning:"
12-10-2018T13:54:58,SageSaga,yo
12-10-2018T13:55:11,ZRO4825,I thought Ethiopian's never had food? :thinking:
12-10-2018T13:58:43,ZRO4825,"Hey, Sage, you know of anyone who's had experience with XP-Pen tablets?"
12-10-2018T13:59:35,SageSaga,nope
12-10-2018T13:59:57,ZRO4825,"Alrighty, ty ^^"
12-10-2018T14:04:27,Tharkis,:ctharkis-earwiggle:
12-10-2018T14:04:56,Tharkis,woke up this morning with a monitor that wouldnt power on =(  now i'm 300$ poorer but have a 4k monitor
12-10-2018T14:06:09,Mippy,I woke up this morning with the migrain from hell and nothing but my little sister's tylonol to take the edge off
12-10-2018T14:06:20,ZRO4825,"I'm on the fence 'bout 4k. It's pretty and all, but as close as I always am to my monitor, I'm not certain it's worth it. Plus I'd have to upgrade my PC anyway to really be able to push a 4k setup, lol"
12-10-2018T14:07:44,SageSaga,yeah you pretty much need a 1080 or better to do 4k gaming even at 60fps if you are lucky
12-10-2018T14:08:00,SageSaga,or drop settings much lower
12-10-2018T14:08:17,ZRO4825,"Yup. At this point I'm pretty okay sticking with my 1080p res, lol"
12-10-2018T14:08:43,Mippy,*compleatly tech illiterate*
12-10-2018T14:08:55,Bgrmystr2,"maybe you should learn, mippy"
12-10-2018T14:08:58,Bgrmystr2,it's not difficult
12-10-2018T14:09:29,Bgrmystr2,"also, 1080p looks just damn fine on a 40inch LED"
12-10-2018T14:09:52,Bgrmystr2,"so the ""necessity"" of 4k is lost on me."
12-10-2018T14:10:04,Mippy,I'd like to. Maybe get a copy of Computers for Dummies or something. XD
12-10-2018T14:10:34,ZRO4825,Eh. I've seen 4k on big TVs. It DOES look damned nice. But having the hardware to push it properly is a bit costly currently.
12-10-2018T14:11:28,SageSaga,for my main monitor I have a 2k monitor
12-10-2018T14:11:51,Tharkis,i've got a gaming monitor that's 144hz 1080p
12-10-2018T14:12:08,Tharkis,"that's where i play my games, the 4k is going to be 99.8% webpages, picarto streams, etc =P"
12-10-2018T14:12:33,ZRO4825,"I have an old as hell 1080p monitor, and a normal TV! :joy:"
12-10-2018T14:12:48,Mippy,"But, yeah, I've got a digital designe class next semester...so i'll at least be a bit more competent with art programs"
12-10-2018T14:15:28,SageSaga,my 2k monitor is also a 144hz - i think theres only 2 4k monitors that really can do 144hz but they are like 1000 dollars
12-10-2018T14:16:41,ZRO4825,"Yeah, I think if anything my next monitor will be more concentrated on a higher hz than rez."
12-10-2018T14:18:24,SageSaga,why not both?
12-10-2018T14:19:07,Bgrmystr2,$$$ probably
12-10-2018T14:20:00,SageSaga,im just saying a lot more 2k monitors are 144hz with little price increase vs just a high end 1080p monitor
12-10-2018T14:21:19,ZRO4825,Honestly just never even considered 2k. They got lost in the sea of 4k talking.
12-10-2018T14:23:22,SageSaga,yeah but 4k has the GPU overhead that makes it near impossible for budget gamers
12-10-2018T14:23:44,SageSaga,2k is doable on a 1070 easily- 1060's can do it well too
12-10-2018T14:25:29,SageSaga,a lot of people dont realize that 4k isn't as simple as being 4 times 1080 - it's 9 times bigger
12-10-2018T14:26:03,SageSaga,so its like trying to run 9 1080 monitors
12-10-2018T14:28:05,ZRO4825,Tis indeed a lot of pixels
12-10-2018T14:28:30,ZRO4825,"My poor little 970 would just be like ""wtf you smokin?"" :rofl:"
12-10-2018T14:34:02,Bgrmystr2,"Fairly damned sure that's not how resolutions work, sage. Bigger than 4, sure, cuz QHD is 3840x2160, but 4k is 4096x2160. it's not even remotely close to 9 times."
12-10-2018T14:35:29,Bgrmystr2,nine 1080p displays would be 3420x5760 and that's not even the same ratio.
12-10-2018T14:35:50,SageSaga,i didnt check my math - kinda busy- however it's important to remember that it is area and not just a flat line
12-10-2018T14:36:04,ZRO4825,9x 1920 = 17280
12-10-2018T14:36:30,ZRO4825,9x 1080 = 9720
12-10-2018T14:36:38,ZRO4825,That's the resolution you're looking for. :P
12-10-2018T14:36:44,Bgrmystr2,naw
12-10-2018T14:36:47,SageSaga,a lot of people just see 3840 vs 1920
12-10-2018T14:36:53,Bgrmystr2,"cuz it's 3 top and 3 wide, zro"
12-10-2018T14:36:59,Bgrmystr2,not 9 across in one direction
12-10-2018T14:37:20,ZRO4825,I like my numbers better. 9x in both directions! ^^
12-10-2018T14:37:30,Bgrmystr2,that's just ridiculous :U
12-10-2018T14:37:37,ZRO4825,But it would be AWESOME
12-10-2018T14:37:53,Bgrmystr2,I will not deny this.
12-10-2018T14:38:10,SageSaga,so yeah- i should have said people think its closer to double when it's actually 4x
12-10-2018T14:38:32,Bgrmystr2,yeah that'd be better :u
12-10-2018T14:38:33,ZRO4825,"Either way 5760x3240 is what you were looking for. You swapped your directions. That's why your ratio was messed up, lol."
12-10-2018T14:38:44,SageSaga,ah i remember where i saw 9x
12-10-2018T14:38:51,SageSaga,i think that was 9x 720p
12-10-2018T14:39:04,Bgrmystr2,"yeah zro, I did"
12-10-2018T14:39:16,Bgrmystr2,but 4k and 1080p aren't the same ratio anyway
12-10-2018T14:39:25,SageSaga,yeah
12-10-2018T14:39:52,SageSaga,thats why they call it 4k and not 3840 x 2160
12-10-2018T14:40:06,SageSaga,because the 1080 is not the first number its the last number- the lower one
12-10-2018T14:40:13,Bgrmystr2,4k being 1.9:1 and 1080p is 16:9 / 1.78:1
12-10-2018T14:40:24,SageSaga,they prefer 3840 vs the 2160
12-10-2018T14:40:37,ZRO4825,"Well it depends. According to what I'm finding 4k refers to either 3840x2160, or 4096x2160. Which is dumb."
12-10-2018T14:41:05,SageSaga,4096? They are actually doing real 4k now? XD
12-10-2018T14:41:05,Ordithus,Good afternoon!
12-10-2018T14:41:15,SageSaga,i havent seen any of them but i dont look em up all that much
12-10-2018T14:41:19,SageSaga,yo Ord
12-10-2018T14:41:24,ZRO4825,Heyyo Ord
12-10-2018T14:41:27,Bgrmystr2,"4k is the 4096, but a lot of people refer to 2160p as 4k cuz it's quad 1080p, but it's not full 4k resolution"
12-10-2018T14:41:45,Bgrmystr2,I've got an article I'm reading here
12-10-2018T14:42:00,Bgrmystr2,I can post it if you like sage :U
12-10-2018T14:42:07,Bgrmystr2,about resolutions and stuff
12-10-2018T14:42:08,SageSaga,uhm - they call the 3840 x 2160 4k
12-10-2018T14:42:20,SageSaga,though its not true- that is what they legit call it
12-10-2018T14:42:50,SageSaga,though i think there was a push to call it UHD instead?
12-10-2018T14:42:53,Bgrmystr2,yeah commercially
12-10-2018T14:44:04,SageSaga,then there is the mess that is HDR
12-10-2018T14:44:59,SageSaga,because for a while they didnt have a set definition for HDR so people just claimed their extra bright tv and monitors were HDR
12-10-2018T14:45:13,ZRO4825,XD
12-10-2018T14:46:02,Bgrmystr2,so..... soft no on link then? :thinking:
12-10-2018T14:46:22,SageSaga,that changed rather recently with an official definition for what HDR is now- they cant do that anymore
12-10-2018T14:46:39,SageSaga,that said- it is still tricky because they had several versions of HDR
12-10-2018T14:47:00,Ordithus,"So old HDR is not the same as new HDR, joy"
12-10-2018T14:47:09,SageSaga,some is
12-10-2018T14:47:41,SageSaga,i dont have time to read it
12-10-2018T14:48:15,Bgrmystr2,I was thinking more just for the benefit of chat
12-10-2018T14:48:37,ZRO4825,"Oh, randomly remembered, Sage, did you know Facebook isn't tossing out the notices for your comics lately?"
12-10-2018T14:48:39,SageSaga,sure go ahead
12-10-2018T14:48:49,Bgrmystr2,:D http://4k.com/resolution/
12-10-2018T14:48:51,SageSaga,It's not? Well Crap
12-10-2018T14:49:04,ZRO4825,Hasn't been for a couple weeks now I think honestly.
12-10-2018T14:49:21,ZRO4825,I kept thinking I was missing something and it took me a while to realize exactly what was missing from my feed lol
12-10-2018T14:49:27,Bgrmystr2,"the page actually goes into like.. 2160p, true 4k, and a bit of HDR as well"
12-10-2018T14:49:34,ZRO4825,I just kinda figured Facebook was being stupid Facebook <_<;
12-10-2018T14:49:57,Bgrmystr2,I just check on Wed for new page
12-10-2018T14:50:21,Bgrmystr2,..and sometimes check on not-wed because force of habit
12-10-2018T14:51:08,Ordithus,Thanks for the link.  I'm probably going to be getting a new computer monitor in the near future
12-10-2018T14:51:19,Ordithus,Gotta start learnin'
12-10-2018T14:51:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Ord........ is that a snowman in your pfp?
12-10-2018T14:51:54,Ordithus,Yes
12-10-2018T14:52:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,smh
12-10-2018T14:52:01,SageSaga,brb im gonna mass update facebook
12-10-2018T14:52:26,Ordithus,But why Marv
12-10-2018T14:52:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,because Halloween
12-10-2018T14:52:55,Ordithus,Haha maybe I'm a snowman for Halloween

12-10-2018T14:58:45,Twokinds,Stressed but physically fine.
12-10-2018T15:00:53,ZRO4825,Best solution to blocks is a hammer! =D
12-10-2018T15:01:03,ZRO4825,"...or a pickaxe, I suppose, if you're playing Minecraft :thinking:"
12-10-2018T15:01:37,Kynum,explosives are good :3
12-10-2018T15:02:21,SageSaga,in modded minecraft hammers take out a 3x3x1 grid of blocks

12-10-2018T15:03:30,ZRO4825,"And..ya know, I have never played an actual modded Minecraft. I've played on servers that had mods to change a few basic vanilla things, or added home zones and such, but never an actual mod."
12-10-2018T15:03:52,SageSaga,that's sad
12-10-2018T15:03:58,Kynum,Thaumaturgy is fun

12-10-2018T15:08:44,SageSaga,they called me the Nuclear Hobo on one server- because I built a nuclear reactor before i built a house
12-10-2018T15:09:16,Bgrmystr2,xDD
12-10-2018T15:10:41,SageSaga,"another server I built a farm that was incredible - but i yelled at kids that got on my yard so i built anti-player turrets and a big fence around the farm with signs saying ""Keep out ya darn kids!"""

12-10-2018T15:13:56,SageSaga,naturally it made more and more people try- which was good because their gravestones caused skeletons to spawn and so i used their skeletons to create bonemeal for my crops

12-10-2018T15:26:14,SageSaga,it's almost as clunky and cluttered now as My Space
12-10-2018T15:28:30,BadFoMo,My Space is still a thing?
12-10-2018T15:29:53,BadFoMo,I was about to joke and say I still use it.
