18-07-2018T00:06:29,Bgrmystr2,yaeh... and ppl want them to survive?
18-07-2018T00:06:39,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. ppl dying is sad and shit but
18-07-2018T00:06:41,Bgrmystr2,srsly?
18-07-2018T00:06:46,Bgrmystr2,they're doing this dumb shit to themselves
18-07-2018T00:10:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Can we hit the reset button now
18-07-2018T00:12:12,Bgrmystr2,I don't think we need that
18-07-2018T00:12:25,Bgrmystr2,"if we press the reset button now, we don't get another chance.."
18-07-2018T00:12:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm waiting for the ‚Äúlol - make yourself sterile‚Äù challenge
18-07-2018T00:12:44,Bgrmystr2,"and if we go down the same inevitable path, squirrels will end up killing everyone"
18-07-2018T00:13:05,Bgrmystr2,"that'd be the best one, kiwi"
18-07-2018T00:13:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe then we will see the magic Nibs
18-07-2018T00:15:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Who I believe has visited my house cause I‚Äôve been running into things lately
18-07-2018T00:16:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Tho maybe I‚Äôm just tired
18-07-2018T09:29:07,Dadrobit,"Mmmm, it's my older bro's birthday today, so I'm having his kids over for a few days at my house."
18-07-2018T09:29:22,Dadrobit,So I likely will not be on here very much for a bit.

18-07-2018T20:03:53,Twokinds,Yeah
18-07-2018T20:04:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Nib is one character that keeps this crazy train on track
18-07-2018T20:04:32,Twokinds,I actually have a very cheesecake idea for an anthroNibbly side comic.
18-07-2018T20:05:05,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúCheesecake‚Äù idea?
18-07-2018T20:05:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Like ‚Äúweird‚Äù or ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù?

18-07-2018T22:46:29,SpazztasticKiwi,So Tom made any new friends
18-07-2018T22:50:08,Vatruvius,Been a while since I showed up here. Hello everyone! :ptv-greetings:
18-07-2018T22:50:22,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs about time
18-07-2018T22:50:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Don‚Äôt you know it‚Äôs rude to be late to a meeting
18-07-2018T22:50:40,Vatruvius,Ohh...did you miss me Kiwi?
18-07-2018T22:50:42,Vatruvius,lol
18-07-2018T22:50:46,Vatruvius,I know...sorry.
18-07-2018T22:51:14,Vatruvius,Got a job so free time kind of took a hit.
18-07-2018T22:51:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I had been wondering how the invigorating saga ‚ÄúVat and The Eternally Dead Computer‚Äù was going
18-07-2018T22:51:59,Vatruvius,"Ohh, I have my computer now!"

18-07-2018T22:52:14,Vatruvius,Got it a couple weeks ago. Took forever.

18-07-2018T22:53:18,Vatruvius,Too bad it is not in stock yet.

18-07-2018T22:56:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom just randomly dropped a dancing Nib and peaced out
18-07-2018T22:56:33,Vatruvius,"I actually have a question for you Tom. I am looking at some drawing tablets to start practicing and creating sketches for my comic. I have found a few affordable items I could save up for, but what is you opinion on a tablet with a screen and without?"
18-07-2018T22:56:40,Vatruvius,Did he?
18-07-2018T22:56:41,Vatruvius,Dang.
18-07-2018T22:57:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Well it shows he‚Äôs still here so he may respond
18-07-2018T22:57:14,Vatruvius,"He is still here, or at least the browser is open."
18-07-2018T22:57:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Try poking him with a stick
18-07-2018T22:57:20,Vatruvius,Yup.
18-07-2018T22:57:25,Vatruvius,I rather not.
18-07-2018T22:57:37,Vatruvius,He might poke me with a kick.
18-07-2018T22:57:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Could try chocolate if he‚Äôs still on that diet
18-07-2018T22:58:08,Vatruvius,An all chocolate diet? How would that work?
18-07-2018T22:58:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"If he‚Äôs on the diet still, the chocolate will get his attention"
18-07-2018T22:58:58,Vatruvius,Ohh...I see what you mean.
18-07-2018T22:59:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"You know, when you vow off fast food and proceed to drive by the Fast Food Strip in your neighborhood"
18-07-2018T22:59:58,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need it. I DON‚ÄôT need it‚Äù
18-07-2018T23:00:12,Vatruvius,"Yeah, I have not eaten fast food in at least ten years, and I have no interest in going back. That food taste terrible compared to what I eat now."
18-07-2018T23:00:56,Vatruvius,"But I do drive by Safeway and think, H√§agen-Dazs would be good."
18-07-2018T23:01:10,SpazztasticKiwi,They‚Äôve started a new (shit) system at work and it low key makes me want to join a gym
18-07-2018T23:01:25,SpazztasticKiwi,So I can punch something and not get arrested for assault
18-07-2018T23:02:52,Vatruvius,lol
18-07-2018T23:04:19,Vatruvius,"Well, I work for my mom more or less. She is the GM. Work is not easy though. Basically, I am the first tech-savy person this business has seen ever. That and I am good on excel so...spreadsheets. Spreadsheets everywhere!"
18-07-2018T23:04:27,Vatruvius,I get paid well enough though.
18-07-2018T23:08:06,Vatruvius,I'll just ask Tom tomorrow before the stream.
18-07-2018T23:08:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not sure he‚Äôll stream
18-07-2018T23:09:21,Vatruvius,Something going on?

18-07-2018T23:10:11,Vatruvius,Ohh...yeah probably no stream then.

18-07-2018T23:13:13,Twokinds,Yes.
18-07-2018T23:13:19,Twokinds,"There, answered."
18-07-2018T23:13:30,Vatruvius,"What is you opinion on drawing tablets, screen or no screen?"
18-07-2018T23:13:30,Vatruvius,lol
18-07-2018T23:13:38,Vatruvius,I would expect nothing less.
18-07-2018T23:14:25,SpazztasticKiwi,He appearith
18-07-2018T23:15:14,Twokinds,Screen
18-07-2018T23:15:30,Twokinds,"I mean, I've used both. I started out on no screen for years."
18-07-2018T23:15:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Never try the ‚ÄúCan I ask you a question?‚Äù Thing with a smartalek
18-07-2018T23:15:46,Twokinds,But screen is just fundimentally better.
18-07-2018T23:15:57,Twokinds,"Funds, though, is the key word."
18-07-2018T23:16:00,Vatruvius,"Okay, cause I am looking into the market."
18-07-2018T23:16:03,Vatruvius,Yeah.
18-07-2018T23:16:34,Vatruvius,Wacum as a cool non-screen but Huron has a nice screen one for the same price.
18-07-2018T23:17:02,Vatruvius,has*
18-07-2018T23:17:10,Vatruvius,Huion*
18-07-2018T23:17:11,Vatruvius,derp.
18-07-2018T23:17:20,Twokinds,I've never used a Huion. I've heard they're pretty good.
18-07-2018T23:17:56,Vatruvius,I imagine that anything I can get around a few hundred would be very good.
18-07-2018T23:18:04,Vatruvius,The cheapest Wacum is like 1500.
18-07-2018T23:18:11,Vatruvius,With a screen that is.
18-07-2018T23:18:43,Vatruvius,That is just too much of an investment when I am not very sure if this will go that far.
18-07-2018T23:24:22,TorqueEmUp,"True, but you could always sell it off at a small loss."
18-07-2018T23:24:52,TorqueEmUp,But yeah. $1500 is insane.
18-07-2018T23:24:55,Vatruvius,"Yeah, but I do not have $1500 laying around to spend."
18-07-2018T23:25:43,Vatruvius,"I am excited though, by the end of August I should have a new computer, peripherals, a drawing tablet of some sort, a new desk, and chair."
18-07-2018T23:26:10,TorqueEmUp,I would imagine a $1500 tablet would be a full PC in itself.
18-07-2018T23:26:21,Vatruvius,"The desk will be long so I can have my computer on it, the drawing tablet, and still have room to do paper work."
18-07-2018T23:26:44,Vatruvius,"I do not know, I think they are just a peripheral."
18-07-2018T23:26:57,Vatruvius,Unless you get like a $5000 one.
18-07-2018T23:27:04,Vatruvius,Where the whole thing is a desk.
18-07-2018T23:27:16,Vatruvius,"I do not know, I just ball parked that price for something like tphat."
18-07-2018T23:27:18,Vatruvius,that*
18-07-2018T23:32:25,TorqueEmUp,Ok they are full PCs but overpriced IMHO for what they are.
18-07-2018T23:33:26,TorqueEmUp,"only 6th gen I7s, only 8GBs of RAM, and Intel Iris integrated graphics. (Not that you are going to game on a drawing tablet. lol)"
18-07-2018T23:34:57,Vatruvius,"God no, if anything I would just get a fancy monitor to hook up to my beast of a computer...uh...when I get a beast of a computer. But my new laptop I will be getting will not be that bad, and upgrade-able internals. XD Big plus."
18-07-2018T23:37:49,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah cheapest thing Wacon sells with a screen is $1k for a 13"" pen display"
18-07-2018T23:38:17,Vatruvius,Yeah.
18-07-2018T23:38:19,TorqueEmUp,and only 1080p
18-07-2018T23:39:10,Vatruvius,"That is why I asked Tom if a screen was worth it. Since it seems to be a big difference, and understandably so, I will be looking at other brands for affordable tablets with screens."
18-07-2018T23:39:34,TorqueEmUp,Makes sense. I would imagine a screen would be a must.
18-07-2018T23:40:39,TorqueEmUp,"I couldn't imagine trying to draw looking up at a screen, and using a pad that was nothing but the input device."
18-07-2018T23:41:12,Vatruvius,"Yeah, until someone recommended Huion to me, I was just settling on Wavum's Intuos Pro, which is their largest non-screen tablet."
18-07-2018T23:41:24,Vatruvius,Was it you who recommended Huion?
18-07-2018T23:41:31,Vatruvius,I cannot really remember.
18-07-2018T23:41:33,TorqueEmUp,"Nope sorry, I don't draw."
18-07-2018T23:42:28,Vatruvius,"In either case, I can see a screen be very helpful, but a non-screen tablet if affordable could be done. Just takes some practice and getting you muscle memory to a point where you can trust your hand to draw while you look at a separate screen."
18-07-2018T23:42:41,Vatruvius,being*
18-07-2018T23:43:12,TorqueEmUp,"Right, I am sure people can get used to it, but it'd definitely have a learning curve."
18-07-2018T23:44:22,TorqueEmUp,"Last I really tried drawing was in middle school, I would take VHS recordings of anime I watched on Toonami, and would freeze frame it on the TV, and I would draw the character."
18-07-2018T23:44:28,Vatruvius,Oh yeah. In my case I can kind of see what I am drawing in my head so I can overlay that onto what I am seeing my hand draw on the tablet if that makes any sense. All it would do is give me a starting place to learn.
18-07-2018T23:44:41,Vatruvius,Nice.
18-07-2018T23:46:31,TorqueEmUp,"If I tried drawing on my own, I couldn't keep things int he proper scale. lol"
18-07-2018T23:47:29,TorqueEmUp,maybe one day I will pick up drawing again. might interest me more to do it through digital means than using pen and paper.
18-07-2018T23:47:37,TorqueEmUp,Pencil and paper*
18-07-2018T23:47:39,Vatruvius,"Ohh yeah, I get what you mean. I have not drawn in a long time and I have not drawn that match to begin with. However, in that time I did manage to produce some pretty good work so I feel with enough practice and sketch after sketch after sketch I can get"
18-07-2018T23:47:40,Vatruvius,there.
18-07-2018T23:48:42,Vatruvius,"Exactly, digital drawing really captures my interest far more than pencil and paper. Not that those are bad, they are just much harder to feel like you are making progress at all when practicing."
18-07-2018T23:48:57,Vatruvius,"Plus, you can do so much more with a digital drawing than you can with a paper and pen one."
