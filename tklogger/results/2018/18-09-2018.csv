18-09-2018T00:00:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Also - virginity is a ‚Äúproduct‚Äù?
18-09-2018T00:00:56,unsteddyphoenix,"Lol not what I was referencing, but I love it"
18-09-2018T00:01:55,unsteddyphoenix,To those types of people obviously.
18-09-2018T00:03:28,SpazztasticKiwi,We go off subject so easily
18-09-2018T00:04:14,Dadrobit,"Slightly on topic, Chicago is a pretty great movie to watch on a long trip."
18-09-2018T00:04:43,SpazztasticKiwi,You need essentials and sleep before you think of entertainment
18-09-2018T00:04:59,unsteddyphoenix,False entertainment is priority
18-09-2018T00:05:06,Dadrobit,What for do you live if not for entertainment?
18-09-2018T00:05:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd suggest some Jacksepticeye but likely not your thing
18-09-2018T00:05:53,unsteddyphoenix,Alternatively you could just not sleep beforehand and then try sleep on the plane
18-09-2018T00:05:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Philip DeFranco is good though and he does news
18-09-2018T00:06:00,unsteddyphoenix,Works...sometimes?
18-09-2018T00:06:30,Dadrobit,A shot of bourbon with a double-shot of NyQuil. Works 100% of the time.
18-09-2018T00:07:11,Dadrobit,"Granted, you'll probably sleep through all of the in-flight meals."
18-09-2018T00:07:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Are you trying to send him to the ER?
18-09-2018T00:07:20,Dadrobit,"Nah, just to Korea"
18-09-2018T00:07:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Pssst alcohol =death for him
18-09-2018T00:07:47,Ordithus,"Go to sleep in America, wake up in Korea.  What a trip."
18-09-2018T00:08:03,unsteddyphoenix,Ideally.
18-09-2018T00:08:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Ather YouTube is Lisa Koshy and Thomas Sanders
18-09-2018T00:08:16,unsteddyphoenix,If he just thinks of it as taking medicine~
18-09-2018T00:08:16,Twokinds,I plan to just use sleeping pills
18-09-2018T00:08:19,SpazztasticKiwi,*other
18-09-2018T00:08:38,Dadrobit,"Ah, the old standard."
18-09-2018T00:09:21,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúAnd we have liftoff‚Äù Tom: *instantly out*
18-09-2018T00:09:42,unsteddyphoenix,thats the dream
18-09-2018T00:09:53,Ordithus,"Maaan, I would love to be able to sleep on a plane."
18-09-2018T00:10:00,Ordithus,"Never happened, not even once."
18-09-2018T00:10:10,unsteddyphoenix,I feel that. I have but its raare
18-09-2018T00:10:25,Ordithus,The trip back from AK last year was hell
18-09-2018T00:10:31,unsteddyphoenix,One time we got bumped up to business class and it wasnt so hard
18-09-2018T00:10:40,Ordithus,"Red eye flight... left at 10 PM, got to MN at 5 AM."
18-09-2018T00:10:42,Ordithus,No sleep
18-09-2018T00:11:01,SpazztasticKiwi,One of my flights you couldn‚Äôt cause there‚Äôs this pack of teen girls going to a cheer tournament that wouldn‚Äôt shut the hell up
18-09-2018T00:11:36,unsteddyphoenix,THe worst are babies
18-09-2018T00:12:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Tell em ‚ÄúPut it on airplane mode‚Äù
18-09-2018T00:12:47,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúOr vibrate‚Äù
18-09-2018T00:14:18,Ordithus,When do you leave?
18-09-2018T00:15:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Geez the pun wasn‚Äôt that bad
18-09-2018T00:16:18,Dadrobit,"Please don't vibrate the baby. That's called shaken baby syndrome, it will put you behind bars."
18-09-2018T00:16:49,Bgrmystr2,so.. airplane or silent mode.
18-09-2018T00:16:50,Bgrmystr2,got it
18-09-2018T00:18:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"Can you imagine that snobby spoiled seat-kicking child buzzing down the aisle though, shaking violently like a phone, horror on their face as they try to make noise but only shake harder?"
18-09-2018T00:20:10,Ordithus,Quelle horreur
18-09-2018T00:26:08,Ordithus,Things not to pack: the kitchen sink.
18-09-2018T00:31:48,Bgrmystr2,yes actually
18-09-2018T00:32:05,Bgrmystr2,And I wouldn't be breathing cuz I'd have fucking died of laughter :ptv-laugh:
18-09-2018T00:32:25,Bgrmystr2,"that is the best mental image, thank you kiwi xD"
18-09-2018T00:34:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I achieve in humor

18-09-2018T00:53:00,unsteddyphoenix,Considering his current sleep schedule...
18-09-2018T00:59:05,SpazztasticKiwi,If he wants to end up passing out on a strangers shoulder that‚Äôs him
18-09-2018T01:01:07,unsteddyphoenix,Never sleep on planes I guess?
18-09-2018T01:03:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Nah
18-09-2018T01:03:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Getting comfortable is a big thing for me
18-09-2018T01:04:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"If I know the person next to me and we‚Äôre close, that arm is mine if I‚Äôm tired"
18-09-2018T01:06:03,unsteddyphoenix,"If I could i'd sleep through every long flight, no matter who's next to me"
18-09-2018T01:09:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm gonna try sleep now I guess
18-09-2018T01:10:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Night peoples

18-09-2018T10:56:24,iliar,test
18-09-2018T13:41:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Guess he had to get one more out before the possibly of bad internet
18-09-2018T14:30:53,Dadrobit,"Hey, Tom. If you're around to read this, best wishes for a smooth trip man!"
18-09-2018T14:52:08,CrimsonQuill,Hello. Is anyone here?
18-09-2018T15:20:27,ThingsAreMoving,"probably, maybe"
18-09-2018T15:21:25,CrimsonQuill,Death: 'IT'S BEEN VERY QUIET.'
18-09-2018T15:21:33,CrimsonQuill,Astfgl: 'Damn!'
18-09-2018T16:09:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"You know what got me last night? Tom said he was gonna try to sleep on the plane. If he was, why was he asking for book and movie recommendations for time he planned to be asleep? ü§î"
18-09-2018T16:09:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Suspicious
18-09-2018T16:09:34,CrimsonQuill,I don't know. I was sleeping.
18-09-2018T16:09:58,CrimsonQuill,"Seriously, I probably saw none of that."
18-09-2018T16:10:07,CrimsonQuill,I'm in a time zone 5 hours ahead.
18-09-2018T16:10:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I know
18-09-2018T16:10:21,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs a joke
18-09-2018T16:10:26,CrimsonQuill,Though a day or two ago we had a short discussion about Doctor WHo.
18-09-2018T16:10:39,CrimsonQuill,"Also, I'm afraid I'm VERY bad at jokes."
18-09-2018T16:11:10,CommanderTrace,hello
18-09-2018T16:11:22,CrimsonQuill,Ooh hullo.
18-09-2018T16:11:42,CrimsonQuill,"So, as per usual, the chat starts to warm up JUST as I need to prepare for bed..."
18-09-2018T16:11:49,CrimsonQuill,Another day in paradise!
18-09-2018T16:14:40,CommanderTrace,xD
18-09-2018T16:19:40,ThingsAreMoving,Planning to be asleep and being able to fall asleep on a plane are two different things.
18-09-2018T16:21:08,ThingsAreMoving,on long flights there should be access to masks with small doses of chloroform
18-09-2018T16:22:15,CrimsonQuill,"No thanks-I read an article by Mr Jeremy Clarkson about how he took just a few antihistamine and sleeping pills, and could barely function in Top Gear later on."
18-09-2018T16:22:30,CrimsonQuill,Though he might have been exaggerating.
18-09-2018T16:23:09,iliar,Want to sleep soundly on the plane? It's easy! Just torture yourself with work so much that you'll sleep on the go!
18-09-2018T16:23:38,ThingsAreMoving,Clarkson? Exaggerating? He'd never!
18-09-2018T16:23:40,ThingsAreMoving,lol
18-09-2018T16:24:11,CrimsonQuill,I have a solution-You need an FTB.
18-09-2018T16:24:43,ThingsAreMoving,'you cannot fast travel when enemies are nearby'
18-09-2018T16:25:04,CrimsonQuill,"No, that's not what the FTB is."
18-09-2018T16:25:21,CrimsonQuill,Ask what it is. GO ON. You know you want to know.
18-09-2018T16:26:04,ThingsAreMoving,I don't need to. You'll tell me anyway
