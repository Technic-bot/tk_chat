20-10-2018T02:12:57,DarthRexKing,Goodnight.
20-10-2018T09:17:46,Twokinds,My house is without power. It's been out for 15 hours. Don't know when it will be up again.
20-10-2018T09:18:34,Twokinds,Might miss stream

20-10-2018T10:20:36,Ordithus,This happens way too much
20-10-2018T10:50:21,FenceEqualizer,That's rough hopefully it'll come back soon. Nothing screams boring then being stuck in a house with no power for that long.
20-10-2018T10:55:49,Dadrobit,That sucks a mighty one. Good luck man. Hope the weather isn't too bad without your climate control up and running.
20-10-2018T11:00:34,Ordithus,Let's hope Tom doesn't turn into a Tomsicle
20-10-2018T11:01:31,FenceEqualizer,Booo

20-10-2018T14:49:25,Wyvern088,1:49 in my zone
20-10-2018T14:49:34,JamesBSquirrel3,So that's how early on - technically.:ptv-wondering:
20-10-2018T14:49:38,Wyvern088,diddnt feel like waiting 3 more hours
20-10-2018T14:49:48,Bgrmystr2,ya won't have to.
20-10-2018T14:49:51,Bgrmystr2,..probably.

20-10-2018T14:49:52,Bgrmystr2,:u
20-10-2018T14:50:04,TerraTheWizard,"ok, so that's me not staying up until the end"
20-10-2018T14:50:05,TerraTheWizard,lol
20-10-2018T14:50:16,TerraTheWizard,unless there's some quick sketches this week
20-10-2018T14:50:21,Wyvern088,I had it in my head Tom was on the west coast
20-10-2018T14:50:23,SpazztasticKiwi,That means I can take a nap
20-10-2018T14:50:23,Combak,Hey all.
20-10-2018T14:50:48,JamesBSquirrel3,So 5pm ish could be rough...
20-10-2018T14:50:51,Bgrmystr2,"Mark is on the west coast, tom is landlocked in Eastern Time lol"
20-10-2018T14:50:57,Bgrmystr2,:u

20-10-2018T14:51:12,BadFoMo,*Mark
20-10-2018T14:51:40,Wyvern088,that makes sense
20-10-2018T14:51:42,Wyvern088,i think
20-10-2018T14:54:46,JamesBSquirrel3,"EST means USA of Eastern time, y'know"
20-10-2018T14:55:25,JamesBSquirrel3,"of course, summer time almost over..."
20-10-2018T14:57:15,Bgrmystr2,EST Eastern Standard Time
20-10-2018T14:57:27,Bgrmystr2,"as opposed to EDT, Eastern Daylight Time"
20-10-2018T14:57:43,Ordithus,"But, it is presently Daylight Time"
20-10-2018T14:57:55,Bgrmystr2,and yeah we're EDT right now
20-10-2018T14:58:09,JamesBSquirrel3,right... I could get the other way as well:ptv-scratch:
20-10-2018T14:58:15,Bgrmystr2,it'll be EST again on Nov 4th in the morning
20-10-2018T14:58:23,Ordithus,nooooo
20-10-2018T14:58:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,noooo time science
20-10-2018T14:59:18,TerraTheWizard,"oh right., i've got to deal with that week where i've left daylight savings, but the us hasn't"
20-10-2018T14:59:38,JamesBSquirrel3,"Anyway... Tom expected 5 pm EST ish due a technical problems, okay."
20-10-2018T14:59:55,TerraTheWizard,"this is why daylight savings needs to go, so much confusion"
20-10-2018T14:59:58,Combak,"Oh, great..."
20-10-2018T15:00:14,Combak,"Well, at least Community Day will be done then."
20-10-2018T15:00:20,Bgrmystr2,"lol, it's not that confusing terra"
20-10-2018T15:00:26,TerraTheWizard,and dst is gonna get worse from march
20-10-2018T15:00:27,js199456,isn't the stream supposed to start by  now?
20-10-2018T15:00:32,Bgrmystr2,takes like 2 mins to learn
20-10-2018T15:00:38,Bgrmystr2,"delayed 1 hr, JS"
20-10-2018T15:00:41,TerraTheWizard,"because the EU has scrapped it, but each member state can decide if it still uses it"

20-10-2018T15:01:46,Bgrmystr2,for like 16 hours or somesuch
20-10-2018T15:02:00,Bgrmystr2,and it just recently came back a few hrs ago or so?
20-10-2018T15:02:05,Bgrmystr2,so he delayed the stream 1 hr
20-10-2018T15:02:06,Ordithus,About
20-10-2018T15:02:08,Twokinds,It was a long time.
20-10-2018T15:02:14,Ordithus,And it got cold
20-10-2018T15:02:21,js199456,did your food get ruined?
20-10-2018T15:02:22,ProsePro7,Roger.  Also just watched Goblin Slayer last night I do admit that it has the most disturbing opening of an anime
20-10-2018T15:02:22,Twokinds,It went out at 7pm last night and came back on at 1pm today
20-10-2018T15:02:26,ThingsAreMoving,"get some batteries already, jeez"
20-10-2018T15:02:39,Ordithus,A powerwall or something haha

20-10-2018T15:03:19,Bgrmystr2,it's not really
20-10-2018T15:03:26,Bgrmystr2,18 hrs is doable

20-10-2018T15:04:00,Bgrmystr2,"still makes you miserable, but at least it's not like.. 11 DAYS of no power due to hurricane."
20-10-2018T15:04:02,ProsePro7,I think three days is the longest power outage I have every been through
20-10-2018T15:04:17,ThingsAreMoving,18hrs without power = rip food in the freezer
20-10-2018T15:04:29,Bgrmystr2,"not if you have a good one, things"

20-10-2018T15:04:45,Bgrmystr2,xD yeah fence
20-10-2018T15:04:49,Bgrmystr2,I've done that several times
20-10-2018T15:04:50,Twokinds,No the food in the freezer is fine
20-10-2018T15:04:53,Bgrmystr2,a week or longer
20-10-2018T15:04:53,Ordithus,Hi w0lf!
20-10-2018T15:05:02,w0lfmare,Mine was out for 4 days last week
20-10-2018T15:05:05,Twokinds,Half my feezer is filled with ice packs because we get power outages so often.
20-10-2018T15:05:10,ThingsAreMoving,smort
20-10-2018T15:05:18,FenceEqualizer,Tom being prepared
20-10-2018T15:05:21,ThingsAreMoving,at least you won't starve
20-10-2018T15:05:22,Ordithus,That is just wtf
20-10-2018T15:05:31,FenceEqualizer,Or well beaten enough to be prepared in this case
20-10-2018T15:06:42,BadFoMo,@Twokinds Have you ever thought about getting a generator?
20-10-2018T15:06:52,ProsePro7,The more full your fridge the less likely to loose temperature
20-10-2018T15:07:01,ThingsAreMoving,would an emergency power generator be cost effective?
20-10-2018T15:07:13,ThingsAreMoving,i hear diesel is dirt cheap in the us
20-10-2018T15:07:39,ProsePro7,3.50 a gallon where I'm at
20-10-2018T15:08:00,ThingsAreMoving,let me convert that to some units i can understand...
20-10-2018T15:08:14,ThingsAreMoving,that's cheap af
20-10-2018T15:08:28,ProsePro7,Where are you things?
20-10-2018T15:08:31,BadFoMo,I have a propane generator.
20-10-2018T15:08:35,ThingsAreMoving,UK right now
20-10-2018T15:08:52,ProsePro7,That explains it.  To us Yanks thats expensive
20-10-2018T15:09:10,Ordithus,Diesel usually costs more than regular gas
20-10-2018T15:10:00,ProsePro7,Ultimate goal for me is to get a house with a generator that runs off of wood gas
20-10-2018T15:10:53,ThingsAreMoving,well solar is pretty decent now
20-10-2018T15:11:04,ThingsAreMoving,esp if you get some wall mounted batteries
20-10-2018T15:11:33,ThingsAreMoving,and store it rather than selling
20-10-2018T15:11:36,ProsePro7,It still has a way to go before its competitive with gas
20-10-2018T15:12:23,ThingsAreMoving,my friend installed like 12-14 panels and his gas and electrical bills dropped by ~60%+
20-10-2018T15:12:36,Ordithus,Hmmm....
20-10-2018T15:12:52,ProsePro7,Oh it will help but the tech is still very expensive
20-10-2018T15:12:57,ThingsAreMoving,"he had to dish some money upfront, but the returns are very much real"
20-10-2018T15:13:20,Bgrmystr2,"with enough solar, and the proper kind of solar, you can remove your power bill completely"
20-10-2018T15:13:29,Bgrmystr2,it'll pay for itself.
20-10-2018T15:13:34,Bgrmystr2,"probably within a year, maybe two"
20-10-2018T15:13:39,Bgrmystr2,"and that's really, REALLY quick"
20-10-2018T15:13:47,ThingsAreMoving,plus some proper thermal isolation of the house
20-10-2018T15:13:51,Bgrmystr2,yeah
20-10-2018T15:13:55,Bgrmystr2,that too
20-10-2018T15:13:57,ThingsAreMoving,and you can live of the grid basically
20-10-2018T15:14:04,ThingsAreMoving,off*
20-10-2018T15:14:13,Bgrmystr2,unless you live in florida
20-10-2018T15:14:30,Bgrmystr2,then the companies will try and sue you for not paying them money cuz you don't NEED them.
20-10-2018T15:14:59,ThingsAreMoving,that sounds like terror
20-10-2018T15:15:18,Bgrmystr2,reasons why I don't want to live in Florida.
20-10-2018T15:15:21,Bgrmystr2,that.
20-10-2018T15:15:28,Ordithus,the snakes

20-10-2018T15:16:18,Bgrmystr2,we're like FL here.. but without some of the dumb laws
20-10-2018T15:16:25,Bgrmystr2,it's still bad but
20-10-2018T15:16:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Florida Man come take me by the hand, lead me to the land that you understand"
20-10-2018T15:16:34,Bgrmystr2,could be worse
20-10-2018T15:16:44,ThingsAreMoving,it can always be worse
20-10-2018T15:16:48,Ordithus,"I happen to like cooler climates and XC skiing, so up North is nice~"
20-10-2018T15:16:54,ThingsAreMoving,but it could be a LOT BETTER too
20-10-2018T15:17:49,ThingsAreMoving,"I'll wait and see how that whole brexit thing works out, and depending on the outcome I'll either stay here or move somewhere north"
20-10-2018T15:18:02,ThingsAreMoving,maybe canada or norway
20-10-2018T15:18:09,ThingsAreMoving,iceland sounds nice too

20-10-2018T15:20:32,Bgrmystr2,lesse
20-10-2018T15:20:33,Combak,"Huh, Tom's power outage was around the same duration as mine."
20-10-2018T15:20:33,ThingsAreMoving,anything above 82F is hot
20-10-2018T15:20:43,Bgrmystr2,"really, things? xD"
20-10-2018T15:20:55,ThingsAreMoving,"i can deal with it, but I don't enjoy it"
20-10-2018T15:21:27,Bgrmystr2,Bermuda is mid-60s to 80F
20-10-2018T15:21:32,Bgrmystr2,all year round

20-10-2018T15:21:51,Bgrmystr2,low 70% to low 80% humidity
20-10-2018T15:21:57,Bgrmystr2,also all year round..
20-10-2018T15:22:10,ThingsAreMoving,"holy shit, that's like living in a soup"
20-10-2018T15:22:24,Bgrmystr2,lol we get to 100% here sometimes xD
20-10-2018T15:22:33,Bgrmystr2,"quite a lot.. ""sometimes"""
20-10-2018T15:22:37,Bgrmystr2,and yes it is
20-10-2018T15:22:42,Ordithus,"HA is almost the same, I think"
20-10-2018T15:22:42,ThingsAreMoving,isn't 100% called 'rain' ?
20-10-2018T15:22:45,Bgrmystr2,no
20-10-2018T15:22:51,Bgrmystr2,humidity is different from rain
20-10-2018T15:22:55,Combak,"So, BGR is from Bermuda?"
20-10-2018T15:22:58,Bgrmystr2,it's just the amount of moisture in the air
20-10-2018T15:23:01,Ordithus,100% means seweating does nothing
20-10-2018T15:23:06,ThingsAreMoving,lol
20-10-2018T15:23:11,Bgrmystr2,..yes Combak
20-10-2018T15:23:14,Bgrmystr2,I am from Bermuda
20-10-2018T15:23:17,Bgrmystr2,you got me.
20-10-2018T15:23:22,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-confused:
20-10-2018T15:23:25,Ordithus,Send the planes!
20-10-2018T15:23:33,Bgrmystr2,it's okay they'll disappear Ord

20-10-2018T15:24:17,Bgrmystr2,prolly don't want to live in Bermuda though
20-10-2018T15:24:24,Bgrmystr2,"hurricanes go through there all the time, seems like"
20-10-2018T15:24:40,ThingsAreMoving,"so back to the original topic, are power generators cost effective?"
20-10-2018T15:24:48,Ordithus,Depends on your needs
20-10-2018T15:24:55,ThingsAreMoving,I mean if I had power outages so often I'd seriously consider getting one
20-10-2018T15:25:02,Ordithus,"Do you really need power, or can you manage?"
20-10-2018T15:25:15,Bgrmystr2,"uh.. I'm not sure. But I'd say you absolutely want a power generator, at least for your fridge"
20-10-2018T15:25:33,Bgrmystr2,cuz it'll cost you more if your WHOLE stockpile of cold / frozen food goes bad
20-10-2018T15:25:38,ThingsAreMoving,Ord that's like asking me if I really need toilet paper or not
20-10-2018T15:25:41,Bgrmystr2,than just paying for the generator + gas
20-10-2018T15:25:43,Ordithus,haha
20-10-2018T15:25:48,ThingsAreMoving,we're not cavemen anymore
20-10-2018T15:25:55,Ordithus,Or you're me and you don't have that much food in your fridge
20-10-2018T15:26:06,Bgrmystr2,well I live with two other people so
20-10-2018T15:26:16,Bgrmystr2,yeah.. it's likely different for me
20-10-2018T15:26:50,Ordithus,"Now, if you run a tech-based business out of your house... yes, you do want a generator"
20-10-2018T15:29:06,Bgrmystr2,yah that.
20-10-2018T15:30:18,Ordithus,"Change of subject, but Evals is stupid cute in the recent page.  Very relax"
20-10-2018T15:30:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,He is not partaking in Mikes sad boi hours

20-10-2018T15:31:58,ThingsAreMoving,His fiancee is there with two naked sailors
20-10-2018T15:32:16,Bgrmystr2,don't think he'd care tho?
20-10-2018T15:32:36,Ordithus,"There's one thing he cares about, and that is Flora"
20-10-2018T15:32:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,He knows Flora is with him all the way
20-10-2018T15:32:47,FenceEqualizer,Not for that but his robe and underwear man
20-10-2018T15:32:57,InTheLionsDen,I want to see if Princess Reni can get through the doorway.
20-10-2018T15:32:58,ThingsAreMoving,that too
20-10-2018T15:33:13,Ordithus,Evals clearly marked the robe as his
20-10-2018T15:33:22,FenceEqualizer,"You don't take another mans underwear, some things are just sacred"
20-10-2018T15:33:28,ThingsAreMoving,yup
20-10-2018T15:33:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I got an idea for Tom’s spotty power
20-10-2018T15:34:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Furnace generator that burns kitty shedding
20-10-2018T15:34:06,Ordithus,ew
20-10-2018T15:34:29,ThingsAreMoving,well if you want to power a tiny LED for a minute or two
20-10-2018T15:34:37,Ordithus,smells like burnt Holly
20-10-2018T15:34:38,FenceEqualizer,Oh god burnt hair smells awful
20-10-2018T15:34:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"Or since Holly apparently needs to lose weight, kitty treadmill"
20-10-2018T15:35:21,SpazztasticKiwi,For maybe a few minutes a day throughout
20-10-2018T15:35:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,take holly on walks :ptv-excited:
20-10-2018T15:36:11,SpazztasticKiwi,She’s afraid of her own shadow
20-10-2018T15:36:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Are you trying to give her a bigger complex
20-10-2018T15:36:27,ThingsAreMoving,walk her during the night then
20-10-2018T15:36:30,ThingsAreMoving,no shadows

20-10-2018T15:37:10,SpazztasticKiwi,What gets you more ladies to flock to you than walking your dog?
20-10-2018T15:37:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Walking your cat
20-10-2018T15:37:14,FenceEqualizer,Is that even a thing. Everytime i see people try to walk a cat they do not move
20-10-2018T15:37:28,Ordithus,Used to go for walks with my cats as a kid
20-10-2018T15:37:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera likes walks
20-10-2018T15:37:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Or rather he likes seeing the outdoors
20-10-2018T15:37:55,ThingsAreMoving,I used to go for walks with my hamster when I was little
20-10-2018T15:37:55,FenceEqualizer,"Cats usually go dead and stare at you like "" bish i'll walk when I want to"""
20-10-2018T15:37:56,SpazztasticKiwi,He prefers if I carry him on my shoulder or such
20-10-2018T15:38:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,My neighbors have actually trained their cat to walk on a leash
20-10-2018T15:38:22,RimaDraws,my cat follows under my feet
20-10-2018T15:38:31,Ordithus,Poor cat

20-10-2018T15:38:51,RimaDraws,well around my feet
20-10-2018T15:38:56,RimaDraws,and sometimes hes not careful
20-10-2018T15:39:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,24/7 trip hazard
20-10-2018T15:39:17,RimaDraws,i hear a loud MEOW and im like i told you to get your furry butt out from under me
20-10-2018T15:39:33,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-LauraCry:
20-10-2018T15:39:40,ThingsAreMoving,one of the worst feelings in the world when you step on your pet and you have no way of telling it how sorry you are when you step on it
20-10-2018T15:39:41,RimaDraws,that poor cat of mine
20-10-2018T15:39:43,FenceEqualizer,"Playing "" Go for a walk"" on hard mode I see , Rima"
20-10-2018T15:40:07,RimaDraws,yea i accidentally stepped on my dachshunds foot and he screeched a yelp and it broke my heart
20-10-2018T15:40:27,ThingsAreMoving,"and it should, you bad person you"
20-10-2018T15:40:29,Bgrmystr2,well yeah when someone steps on your toe it hurts like a sob
20-10-2018T15:40:34,RimaDraws,but my cat does it deliberately lol
20-10-2018T15:40:35,Bgrmystr2,so it's understandable
20-10-2018T15:40:50,RimaDraws,i love my pets tho seriously
20-10-2018T15:41:07,RimaDraws,i pick them up if i do accidentally step on them and give them hugs
20-10-2018T15:41:57,Tharkis,"my suggestion for this week wsnt really halloween themed, but last week it got 4th place in votes so i had to resubmit >_<"
20-10-2018T15:42:56,ThingsAreMoving,I don't know how to rephrase mine so that it doesn't feel creepy
20-10-2018T15:43:01,ThingsAreMoving,so I've abandoned it
20-10-2018T15:43:33,Ordithus,I went with a sexy halloween suggestion

20-10-2018T15:44:35,Tharkis,i went with touch fluffy tail followup.
20-10-2018T15:44:54,Tharkis,the 'merciful nora!' line totally just made the logical follow up pop into my mind when he drew that
20-10-2018T15:46:29,ThingsAreMoving,That snep village feels like a small sidecomic already
20-10-2018T15:46:51,ThingsAreMoving,Not complaining though. It's still fun.
20-10-2018T15:47:39,Bgrmystr2,does it?
20-10-2018T15:47:43,Bgrmystr2,it's been like 2 pages

20-10-2018T15:51:31,SpazztasticKiwi,But I try to give him breaks and not make him wear it all the time

20-10-2018T15:52:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Sometimes it’s funny to see him in the hall cause with juuuust enough light you just see his eyes

20-10-2018T16:24:27,Bgrmystr2,some people die heros
20-10-2018T16:24:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom this might be a stupid question but do you have an auto save feature on for PS?
20-10-2018T16:25:06,ThingsAreMoving,if you can't be a hero than it's better to be a villain than to become an hero
20-10-2018T16:25:06,Bgrmystr2,"I can understand Phoenix, but I didn't actually understand you, Ord. Have you been here for a long time?"
20-10-2018T16:25:20,Bgrmystr2,I saw phoenix's name way back in the Ustream screencaps
20-10-2018T16:25:26,Bgrmystr2,so I know he's been here foreverrrrr
20-10-2018T16:25:40,Ordithus,I started here when Tom drew Saria drawing Rose
20-10-2018T16:25:45,Wyvern088,"welp, if nothings gonna happen here Imma peace out"
20-10-2018T16:25:46,Ordithus,"So, not that long"
20-10-2018T16:25:51,Bgrmystr2,ah okay I remember that
20-10-2018T16:25:59,Wyvern088,"go draw my own stuff, Cya all!"
20-10-2018T16:26:11,Ordithus,"I think Tom modded me because my avatar was Alice from CB, a copper"
20-10-2018T16:26:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,have fun Wy
20-10-2018T16:26:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I think that day Ord and Steddy were deputized out of pure need
20-10-2018T16:26:21,ProsePro7,The failure of heroes is all Almight's fault
20-10-2018T16:26:30,Bgrmystr2,"ah yeah, tom does stuff like that on a whim huh"
20-10-2018T16:26:32,Ordithus,Kiwi is right about that part
20-10-2018T16:26:35,w0lfmare,Draw Tom drawing Saria drawing Rose
20-10-2018T16:26:37,SpazztasticKiwi,And they were two he trusted enough still there
20-10-2018T16:26:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Ord is bet mod imo
20-10-2018T16:26:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,best even
20-10-2018T16:26:59,Ordithus,I haven't used my powers since that fateful day
20-10-2018T16:27:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"still, cool mod"
20-10-2018T16:27:10,ThingsAreMoving,"ve needed order, and ve needed it schnell!"
20-10-2018T16:27:13,Bgrmystr2,"and yeah it was necessity at the time, but I was just wonderin about the user choice specifically"
20-10-2018T16:27:14,JamesBSquirrel3,Still problems for Tom?:ptv-wondering:
20-10-2018T16:27:16,ProsePro7,Thats what we are missing chat trolls
20-10-2018T16:27:21,Bgrmystr2,Tom delayed stream till tomorrow
20-10-2018T16:27:23,RimaDraws,so whats everyone gonna do now

20-10-2018T16:27:31,ThingsAreMoving,"James, no stream today, stream tomorrow."
20-10-2018T16:27:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,thinking about drawing some my self

20-10-2018T16:27:58,ProsePro7,YES!
20-10-2018T16:28:01,SpazztasticKiwi,If Ord/Steddy were absent or unavailable I’m sure someone else worthy of emergency deputization would become a mod
20-10-2018T16:28:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Ord are you binky or the brain?
20-10-2018T16:28:21,ProsePro7,Narf!

20-10-2018T22:26:25,NeonMitsumi,Serpent still roams the Earth.
20-10-2018T22:26:39,MrEase,"okay, I thought I missed like... the suggestion vote, when I heard I missed a poll"
20-10-2018T22:26:47,RimaDraws,ugh
20-10-2018T22:26:52,MrEase,which I probably will miss depending on when the stream is
20-10-2018T22:26:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom is master
20-10-2018T22:27:01,SpazztasticKiwi,At creating mass confusion
20-10-2018T22:27:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,and scares
20-10-2018T22:27:37,DuskyTheHuskie,To Merv and his scares of Zen.
20-10-2018T22:34:53,MrEase,I mean Zen Clovis is a fun hateship
20-10-2018T22:35:13,RimaDraws,i disagree
20-10-2018T22:35:16,MrEase,nothin wrong with it as long as theres a weird redemption arc first
20-10-2018T22:36:49,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-maevecute:
20-10-2018T22:37:01,Ordithus,Maeve remembers
20-10-2018T22:37:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Maeve will remember that
20-10-2018T22:39:44,NeonMitsumi,Maeve is precious
20-10-2018T22:45:26,MrEase,"okay yeah Clovis tried to kill maeve, but I mean Trace is technically in the middle of a redemption arc"
20-10-2018T22:45:42,MrEase,how many adorable Keidran kids did he kill?
20-10-2018T22:46:11,Bgrmystr2,he's not really in a redemption arc though.
20-10-2018T22:46:24,Bgrmystr2,cuz that would mean it'd have to be evil trace that is learning that he doesn't have to be evil
20-10-2018T22:46:30,Bgrmystr2,and that's not the case
20-10-2018T22:46:30,MrEase,"though to be fair, I'd also be happy with a villain through and through"
20-10-2018T22:46:48,MrEase,So I'm hoping for scenery chewing full on evil Clovis
20-10-2018T22:47:40,Bgrmystr2,"Current trace has absolutely no memories of being evil to begin with, so he has no in-depth redemption really, just fighting an inner battle against someone else"
20-10-2018T22:50:25,CrRAR,Trace could be the same person again
20-10-2018T22:50:28,CrRAR,...just needs the right...conditions... >:3
20-10-2018T22:50:59,MrEase,"it really depends if the memories fully returns with his time in the mansion and he overcomes the memories to remain the somewhat adjusted person he is now, just without the naivety"
20-10-2018T22:51:14,Bgrmystr2,"well, he's been winning against the fight against his evil half"
20-10-2018T22:51:21,NeonMitsumi,@CrRAR I think that one's called the third floor.
20-10-2018T22:51:23,MrEase,it might help him become a little less... blank slate-y
20-10-2018T22:51:28,MrEase,^
20-10-2018T22:51:36,MrEase,"What Neon said, I'd be down"
20-10-2018T22:51:55,Bgrmystr2,"or at least, that one room on the third floor specifically"
20-10-2018T22:53:33,Ordithus,Or he'll turn evil again and kill everyone we've come to love over these 15 years
20-10-2018T22:53:40,Bgrmystr2,haha
20-10-2018T22:53:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,pls no ;-;
