18-10-2018T09:02:20,CrRAR,...folks were talking about caffeinated squirrels randomly at work just now...
18-10-2018T09:12:34,Twokinds,Maaan I still need to do that side comic.
18-10-2018T09:12:51,CrRAR,what a dragggg
18-10-2018T09:13:14,CrRAR,"...speaking of which, is it the one about Natani?"
18-10-2018T09:13:39,Twokinds,"Nah that's another, other side comic."
18-10-2018T09:13:59,Twokinds,I'm working on like three or four.
18-10-2018T09:18:28,iliar,I wonder how much all you have is not completed side comics.
18-10-2018T09:19:36,iliar,I know probably about... 4-5.

18-10-2018T09:29:49,Twokinds,The first three aren't side comics.
18-10-2018T09:30:14,Twokinds,They're just other comics.

18-10-2018T09:51:52,Twokinds,"Too many concepts, not enough time."
18-10-2018T09:53:27,Xexanoth,"just clone yourself a couple of times, problem solved"
18-10-2018T09:57:31,iliar,"Yes, clone yourself so that the clone works for you. But then each clone will think &quot;I need to create a clone that will work instead of me&quot; and will create a clone from the clone. And then each clone from a clone will think ..."
18-10-2018T10:02:24,Twokinds,I think two mes would be enough.
18-10-2018T10:02:28,Twokinds,Maaaybe three.

18-10-2018T13:40:43,Twokinds,Well she is an orange cat.
18-10-2018T13:41:18,SpazztasticKiwi,What does that have to do with the pice of tea in china
18-10-2018T13:41:22,Twokinds,They are historically lasagna lovers.
18-10-2018T13:41:33,Twokinds,"The real question is, how does she feel about Mondays."

18-10-2018T13:42:05,SpazztasticKiwi,If I had to guess

18-10-2018T20:15:09,Nekonny,Its a chap side trip when you're already in japan
18-10-2018T20:15:15,Nekonny,*cheap
18-10-2018T20:15:19,Twokinds,Oh that's true
18-10-2018T20:15:22,Twokinds,You were in Japan?
18-10-2018T20:15:25,Nekonny,I... just dont' know what to do
18-10-2018T20:15:41,Nekonny,"no offensse, but it seemd like there were very few places to visit"
18-10-2018T20:15:45,Nekonny,at least in Busan
18-10-2018T20:15:55,Nekonny,"well, last time I went"
18-10-2018T20:16:03,Nekonny,was... over a year ago

18-10-2018T20:16:20,Twokinds,From Seoul to Busan
18-10-2018T20:16:46,Nekonny,the flight over from japan was about $50
18-10-2018T20:16:49,Twokinds,Got to see the DMZ
18-10-2018T20:16:59,Twokinds,Or at least a small part of it
18-10-2018T20:17:01,Nekonny,"adnd the hotels in korea were the same price, but much higher quality"

18-10-2018T20:17:43,Nekonny,Got the sense there was a much higher concentration of modern urbanization than the traditional parks/temples I was used to seeing in japan
18-10-2018T20:18:00,Nekonny,they have a bullet train?
18-10-2018T20:18:31,HeresyArtStream,"On Tom's stream I am just getting the spinning buffer wheel no matter which codec I use. x,x"

18-10-2018T20:20:04,CrRAR,Must be highly demanding.
18-10-2018T20:20:05,Nekonny,"Oh, nice!"
18-10-2018T20:20:16,Nekonny,I fell in love with the trains there...
18-10-2018T20:20:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Like ticket checker or ticket seller
18-10-2018T20:20:49,Nekonny,I set the entire media center where I work to play one of my favorite jingles whenever they turn the machines on
18-10-2018T20:20:53,CrRAR,He is MASTER of all things ticket
18-10-2018T20:20:57,Twokinds,Uh... I dunno. There was a bit of a language barrier.
18-10-2018T20:21:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Ahh
18-10-2018T20:21:03,Twokinds,I heard train and tickets.
18-10-2018T20:21:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Well I‚Äôm sure he likely did a bit of both

18-10-2018T20:24:32,Twokinds,Yeah there aren't any trains in Cincinnati.
18-10-2018T20:24:33,CrRAR,Probably was pretty horrendous... most Boston train rides are
18-10-2018T20:24:39,Twokinds,Or actually that's not true

18-10-2018T20:25:37,Nekonny,I would have thought that area of Cincinnati to be packed with trains and lines
18-10-2018T20:25:39,Twokinds,Public transportation isn't that great in Cinci
18-10-2018T20:25:42,Nekonny,theres one railine where I live

18-10-2018T21:50:13,Bgrmystr2,it's prolly just cuz the speed of how fast she's moving making the program do that

18-10-2018T21:54:09,Taurin,Hmmm ok
18-10-2018T21:54:11,Bgrmystr2,he's asking the name of the program ron is using lol

18-10-2018T21:54:46,Taurin,Ok
18-10-2018T21:54:52,Nekonny,alternatively you can try Live2d
18-10-2018T21:54:55,Combak,I'm pretty sure you're reading it wrong.

18-10-2018T21:55:21,Bgrmystr2,I could say the same XD
18-10-2018T21:55:25,Bgrmystr2,but either way
18-10-2018T21:55:41,Combak,"""The name of this specific animation"" is pretty clear."
18-10-2018T21:56:07,Dadrobit,Seems to be a rather very intuitively flexible program.
18-10-2018T21:56:13,Combak,"Especially since the word ""program"" is never used in the post."

18-10-2018T21:57:15,Dadrobit,I kinda miss the lady in black's animation where she was in the manual T car.
18-10-2018T21:57:19,Nekonny,but I could guess you're talking about the one you see everyone that renders this program using
18-10-2018T21:57:30,swack24,heh
18-10-2018T21:57:41,Nekonny,"in that case, its simply called "" Sample 1test"

18-10-2018T21:58:43,Nekonny,use google translate; it's what I did
18-10-2018T21:59:01,Bgrmystr2,it has a specific style of animation that's fairly difficult to find anywhere else
18-10-2018T21:59:03,Dadrobit,I prefer Emo Phillips myself.
18-10-2018T22:00:01,FoxxTrotter,Emo Philips is great. Saw him live a few years ago.
