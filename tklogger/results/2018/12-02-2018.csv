12-02-2018T00:02:02,Twokinds,California is too expensive.
12-02-2018T00:02:31,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s that too. My grandpa lives in San Francisco
12-02-2018T00:02:44,SpazztasticKiwi,But he also has his own business
12-02-2018T00:06:29,CrimsonHelsing,"I wouldn't pick California as of late tho, especially given how crazy it's been in the news"
12-02-2018T00:06:39,CrimsonHelsing,but I'm not getting into that
12-02-2018T00:07:01,TheBeckoner,Texas is never not humid lol always wet.
12-02-2018T00:07:17,CrimsonHelsing,you haven't been to central Texas xP
12-02-2018T00:07:18,TheBeckoner,Its like 64% right now
12-02-2018T00:07:27,CrimsonHelsing,*west
12-02-2018T00:07:29,TheBeckoner,Yeah I live bye the coast
12-02-2018T00:07:36,TheBeckoner,gulf I guess
12-02-2018T00:07:38,Twokinds,I'm sticking with Cincinnati
12-02-2018T00:07:45,CrimsonHelsing,sounds solid
12-02-2018T00:07:50,TheBeckoner,Az is always dry though.
12-02-2018T00:08:03,CrimsonHelsing,"oh God yeah, and Nevada"
12-02-2018T00:08:21,CrimsonHelsing,'specially around the Vegas area and the Mojave region
12-02-2018T00:08:33,TheBeckoner,It think my dad was born in Ohio? Not sure.
12-02-2018T00:08:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"I looked at Cincinnati. Not only is it insanely far, but y’all got buckets of snow."
12-02-2018T00:08:46,TheBeckoner,Suck the money and the life outta yah
12-02-2018T00:08:52,Twokinds,Though a decent house is still 350k. A selfish part of me is kinda hoping a market correction sends housing prices down at least temporarily.
12-02-2018T00:08:54,TheBeckoner,sucks*
12-02-2018T00:09:25,TheBeckoner,"Just make a magic ""cheap house"" button"
12-02-2018T00:09:57,TheBeckoner,"or a ""correction"" button"
12-02-2018T00:10:39,Twokinds,Snow doesn't bother me because I just don't go outside when it snows.
12-02-2018T00:10:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Solid plan
12-02-2018T00:11:04,MidnightBlue78,":ctwokinds-RainezZz: good night peeps, see ya'll later"
12-02-2018T00:11:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Midnight
12-02-2018T00:11:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"Night, midnight"
12-02-2018T00:12:23,CrimsonHelsing,same here Tom
12-02-2018T00:12:40,CrimsonHelsing,"another reason to love snow for me, I get to stay in and try to stay warm"
12-02-2018T00:12:48,CrimsonHelsing,and imo that's easier than trying to stay cool
12-02-2018T00:12:58,CrimsonHelsing,and more comfortable for me
12-02-2018T00:13:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Winter is easy: you just add layers till you’re warm. Summer is a problem because there’s only so many layers you can take off until it becomes illegal
12-02-2018T00:14:21,CrimsonHelsing,summer becomes better when we're in an age where we have the technology to cool the surface of Venus
12-02-2018T00:14:31,TheBeckoner,Goodnight Midnight!
12-02-2018T00:14:57,TheBeckoner,HeyIlikebeingnaked
12-02-2018T00:15:07,CrimsonHelsing,xD
12-02-2018T00:15:24,TheBeckoner,Idk I guess I just sweat well??
12-02-2018T00:15:48,CrimsonHelsing,pfft idk
12-02-2018T00:15:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Sweat. One of the many reasons I don’t go work out
12-02-2018T00:16:00,TheBeckoner,"When I get too cold, I feel pain, I've never really felt pain from being hot aside from a burn or something."
12-02-2018T00:16:03,CrimsonHelsing,I just have a good metabolism
12-02-2018T00:16:21,TheBeckoner,Like I REALLY hate having cold hands
12-02-2018T00:16:26,CrimsonHelsing,hell I eat unhealthy and amazingly I'm not a fat slob xP
12-02-2018T00:16:44,TheBeckoner,"Lol same, my body refuses to give me weight in any form."
12-02-2018T00:16:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I had good metabolism till high school
12-02-2018T00:17:17,TheBeckoner,"If Im like my relatives, I should be good till about 30-35"
12-02-2018T00:17:39,CrimsonHelsing,I dread that decade of age
12-02-2018T00:17:59,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s not that old
12-02-2018T00:18:39,TheBeckoner,I dont really think I'm dreading any age in particular.
12-02-2018T00:19:15,TheBeckoner,"Young = capable, Old = wise Both are good"
12-02-2018T00:19:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Same here. I’m probably going to be just as sassy as I am now
12-02-2018T00:21:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Just a quick question: how many cats is too many at one time?
12-02-2018T00:21:12,TheBeckoner,I hope I never feel old and out of touch. If I fear anything its becoming obsolete as a human.
12-02-2018T00:21:35,TheBeckoner,Maybe 56 cats? In a 3x3' room?
12-02-2018T00:22:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Then I’m still in the safe range.
12-02-2018T00:23:04,SpazztasticKiwi,That does make me think. I hope I don’t develop the same illnesses as some of my family
12-02-2018T00:25:20,Twokinds,1 cat is too many
12-02-2018T00:25:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I have two though.
12-02-2018T00:25:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I got 4
12-02-2018T00:25:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Are you saying you don’t like yours?
12-02-2018T00:26:01,unsteddyphoenix,I want all your cats
12-02-2018T00:26:12,unsteddyphoenix,at one time
12-02-2018T00:26:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"I technically have four, but ones my moms and the others my sisters"
12-02-2018T00:26:34,Twokinds,I am alergic.
12-02-2018T00:26:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Why do you have the one you have then?
12-02-2018T00:27:11,unsteddyphoenix,It is very inconsiderate of you to be allergic to your poor cat. :/
12-02-2018T00:27:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
12-02-2018T00:27:23,Twokinds,I did not buy the cat.
12-02-2018T00:27:34,CrimsonHelsing,really now?
12-02-2018T00:27:40,Twokinds,My mother buys all the pets.
12-02-2018T00:27:44,iliar,Hmm.... I was sure that you have a cat.
12-02-2018T00:27:50,Twokinds,I would never have a pet if given the choice.
12-02-2018T00:27:57,CrimsonHelsing,aw
12-02-2018T00:28:04,Bgrmystr2,For someone who's alergic to cats.. you seem to like drawing cats.
12-02-2018T00:28:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,not even a squirrel?
12-02-2018T00:28:16,unsteddyphoenix,It is deliciously ironic that you seem to hate animals
12-02-2018T00:29:21,CrimsonHelsing,Guys!
12-02-2018T00:29:29,CrimsonHelsing,don't look into it too much
12-02-2018T00:29:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I am a boy thank you very much
12-02-2018T00:29:41,Twokinds,"I don't hate animals, I just like to be alone."
12-02-2018T00:29:57,CrimsonHelsing,"ah, a solitary person"
12-02-2018T00:29:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I was under the impression that the cat was yours and the dogs were your mother’s
12-02-2018T00:30:08,unsteddyphoenix,Solitary people...normally get pets though
12-02-2018T00:30:13,unsteddyphoenix,They like..dont count?
12-02-2018T00:30:17,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
12-02-2018T00:30:26,unsteddyphoenix,Though I suppose you do always gotta take care of 'em
12-02-2018T00:30:32,CrimsonHelsing,"humans are social creatures. without any company, even pets, we'd go mad"
12-02-2018T00:30:41,Bgrmystr2,Tom is Ascended Solitary.
12-02-2018T00:30:46,Twokinds,It's just extra hassle. XD
12-02-2018T00:30:48,unsteddyphoenix,#NotAllHumans
12-02-2018T00:30:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"Is it a case of “it’s cute, I’m getting it”?"
12-02-2018T00:30:59,unsteddyphoenix,Avoiding hassle is something I DO understand
12-02-2018T00:31:15,unsteddyphoenix,"But, I love 'em so."
12-02-2018T00:31:26,CrimsonHelsing,same here
12-02-2018T00:31:27,Bgrmystr2,"Like the saiyans, Tom's need to be alone goes even further beyond. :v"
12-02-2018T00:31:43,unsteddyphoenix,Haha right?
12-02-2018T00:31:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,so.... Hyperbolic time chamber
12-02-2018T00:31:53,Bgrmystr2,xD
12-02-2018T00:31:54,CrimsonHelsing,huh? xD
12-02-2018T00:32:02,unsteddyphoenix,"""This...is introversion TWO"""
12-02-2018T00:32:06,Bgrmystr2,hahahaha
12-02-2018T00:32:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
12-02-2018T00:32:21,Bgrmystr2,aggressive screaming in the background
12-02-2018T00:32:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’ve been told I’m allergic to cats, but I’m not sure about that diagnosis. They only did a blood test"
12-02-2018T00:32:40,unsteddyphoenix,"Ignore it, theyre just trying to keep all the cats to themselves..."
12-02-2018T00:33:16,Twokinds,"I can't explain it, I just love being isolated. It feels nice. :) I'm just a natural hermit."
12-02-2018T00:33:25,Twokinds,I swear I'm not a miserable sod.
12-02-2018T00:33:43,CrimsonHelsing,I hear ya xD
12-02-2018T00:33:51,unsteddyphoenix,"Haha, no I understand, I have friends like that."
12-02-2018T00:33:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"You do seem like a very chill, quiet dude. That’s what my first impression was"
12-02-2018T00:34:43,unsteddyphoenix,Ideally i'd like to live alone too. Just want cat~
12-02-2018T00:35:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I think I have my animals so I have a kind of non human companionship
12-02-2018T00:35:42,Twokinds,If the cat or squirrel paid rent I'd be happy to live with them.
12-02-2018T00:35:57,SpazztasticKiwi,They pay in love
12-02-2018T00:36:05,unsteddyphoenix,^
12-02-2018T00:36:11,SpazztasticKiwi,And mouse catching
12-02-2018T00:36:24,unsteddyphoenix,I want to see a squirrel catch a mouse
12-02-2018T00:36:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,the power of love is a curious thing
12-02-2018T00:37:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you live with all those animals and you’re allergic to them, aren’t you miserable/sick?"
12-02-2018T00:37:20,unsteddyphoenix,"He has drugs, surely"
12-02-2018T00:38:14,CrimsonHelsing,xD
12-02-2018T00:38:32,Twokinds,Yeah
12-02-2018T00:38:51,Twokinds,"I have an air filter and my roomba, but I do deal with allergies a lot too"
12-02-2018T00:39:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m sorry
12-02-2018T00:39:34,unsteddyphoenix,"Damn, still not enough."
12-02-2018T00:41:23,Twokinds,"The problem is she's extremely clingy. She never leaves my room, so I'm stuck with her 24/7."
12-02-2018T00:41:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Awww
12-02-2018T00:42:01,unsteddyphoenix,...damn that's cute...
12-02-2018T00:42:10,unsteddyphoenix,Unless she knows what she's doing
12-02-2018T00:42:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,wait your cat or your roomba?
12-02-2018T00:42:19,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
12-02-2018T00:42:33,Twokinds,She just came over looking for attention.
12-02-2018T00:43:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I can’t find my cat. He caught a mouse that I had to take from him and I think he’s mad at me
12-02-2018T00:43:12,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:
12-02-2018T00:43:16,unsteddyphoenix,Carefully apply attention please

12-02-2018T00:44:54,SpazztasticKiwi,He had a live mouse. I wasn’t going to let him eat it or get himself bit
12-02-2018T00:45:25,TheBeckoner,I like cats but I am also allergic to them. I break out and get all swollen and red lol.
12-02-2018T00:45:34,TheBeckoner,but its worth it every time.
12-02-2018T00:46:27,TheBeckoner,My dad hates cats. So all we have is dogs and little pigs.
12-02-2018T00:46:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Is she your mothers and she just likes you or did your mom get her for you?
12-02-2018T00:47:42,unsteddyphoenix,:dog::pig:
12-02-2018T00:53:26,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s gotten to the point with me that I’m happy with reptiles. I think that’s what im sticking to after Kiwi and Bagheera pass
12-02-2018T00:58:14,TheBeckoner,Get a big ol turtle. it'll out live you.

12-02-2018T01:04:06,TheBeckoner,I like lizards and what not. Grew up catching anoles and what not. the bigger they were the better!
12-02-2018T01:04:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Anoles run rampant around here
12-02-2018T01:05:00,TheBeckoner,Do you have the green or tan ones?
12-02-2018T01:05:14,TheBeckoner,The green ones are slow so they are easy to catch
12-02-2018T01:05:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Both - one’s invasive

12-02-2018T01:15:59,unsteddyphoenix,Is that what you were doin' today?
12-02-2018T01:16:03,unsteddyphoenix,Besides painting

12-02-2018T01:16:52,unsteddyphoenix,"Damn im excited for this, for the ease of access if nothing else."
12-02-2018T01:17:14,unsteddyphoenix,Won't have to battle patreon to look at the older stuff :D
12-02-2018T01:17:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Did you go to any classes or did you just start drawing and practiced to get where you are?
12-02-2018T01:17:52,Twokinds,"Yeah, hopefully people like it!"
12-02-2018T01:18:53,iliar,You no needed  to battle patreon to look at the older stuff. Just download all https://yadi.sk/d/44j2dL6U3G9HGQ
12-02-2018T01:18:56,unsteddyphoenix,You could make like
12-02-2018T01:19:04,unsteddyphoenix,A top 10 list of your favourites or something
12-02-2018T01:19:13,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, that works too~"
12-02-2018T01:19:25,Twokinds,I didn't take any classes to start out.
12-02-2018T01:19:31,Twokinds,Though I started drawing very young.
12-02-2018T01:19:34,Twokinds,Uh...
12-02-2018T01:19:45,Twokinds,I went to college for art.
12-02-2018T01:19:51,Twokinds,I learned a lot there.
12-02-2018T01:20:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"So did I, but the teacher had a focus on black and white work."
12-02-2018T01:23:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve mainly been learning through my own style and watching others
12-02-2018T01:24:42,unsteddyphoenix,"How much should I use references to practise, you think?"
12-02-2018T01:24:50,unsteddyphoenix,Im kind of feeling like it might be a crutch
12-02-2018T01:25:13,Twokinds,Use it 100%
12-02-2018T01:25:27,CrimsonHelsing,xD
12-02-2018T01:25:40,Twokinds,Just make a collage.
12-02-2018T01:25:51,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah? It's not like...going to idk, make me dependent on them or something"
12-02-2018T01:25:54,unsteddyphoenix,uh.
12-02-2018T01:26:11,Twokinds,No.
12-02-2018T01:26:31,Twokinds,Use references as much as you can.
12-02-2018T01:26:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I was told not to use a lot of references because it wasn’t good
12-02-2018T01:27:05,Twokinds,No artist knows how to draw everything from memory.
12-02-2018T01:27:21,Twokinds,I have to look up how to draw stuff ALL the time.
12-02-2018T01:27:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn’t take all the advice I was given to heart
12-02-2018T01:28:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I learn something and adapt it to how I work
12-02-2018T01:28:53,Twokinds,You'd never learn anything if you didn't reference anything
12-02-2018T01:29:04,Twokinds,It's a big part of learning to draw.
12-02-2018T01:29:17,unsteddyphoenix,I see i see
12-02-2018T01:29:34,Twokinds,"I wouldn't trust someone who says don't use references, or that it's cheating."
12-02-2018T01:29:52,Twokinds,"As long as you're not literally tracing art and calling it your own, do whatever you can to improve"
12-02-2018T01:29:54,unsteddyphoenix,Thanks! Theres so much conflicting info out there it seems
12-02-2018T01:30:22,unsteddyphoenix,Ill takw that to heart
12-02-2018T01:31:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"The best tip I think I’ve seen at this point is draw eyes step by step together, not separately"
12-02-2018T01:33:19,CrimsonHelsing,"I could not agree more, actually. that's what a lot of artists I think should do, Tom."
12-02-2018T01:33:29,unsteddyphoenix,Cant just copy paste the eyes?
12-02-2018T01:34:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m talking about paper drawing
12-02-2018T01:34:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"I am thinking of getting a tablet though. Probably would be better, but it’ll be something to adapt"
12-02-2018T01:35:45,unsteddyphoenix,Do what i did and commandeer your sisters
12-02-2018T01:36:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"Might make learning calligraphy easier. I do some of it now, but it’s based off of stencils. I want to put my own spin on it"
12-02-2018T01:39:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"Where are you from, unsteddy?"
12-02-2018T01:40:16,unsteddyphoenix,New zealand
12-02-2018T01:41:02,unsteddyphoenix,So i wont know nothin bout states~
12-02-2018T01:42:08,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s not a problem. Just know I live in a state that’s considered part of the south
12-02-2018T01:46:43,unsteddyphoenix,I do know stereotypes about the south
12-02-2018T01:47:49,Twokinds,aaaah
12-02-2018T01:47:53,Twokinds,There's so many typos
12-02-2018T01:48:16,Twokinds,I can't believe how many typos there are. It's like every page.
12-02-2018T01:48:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t you have autocorrect?
12-02-2018T01:48:43,unsteddyphoenix,Apparently he didnt~
12-02-2018T01:48:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Or spell check?
12-02-2018T01:49:02,Twokinds,That doesn't fix grammer
12-02-2018T01:49:12,Twokinds,And Photoshop's spellcheck is pretty primative.
12-02-2018T01:49:16,Twokinds,But that's not the issue
12-02-2018T01:49:17,unsteddyphoenix,Shouldve made Sage or someone look at them before posting
12-02-2018T01:49:22,Twokinds,I have all the errors listed
12-02-2018T01:49:24,unsteddyphoenix,I can never see my own typos
12-02-2018T01:49:29,Twokinds,I got it back from my editor
12-02-2018T01:49:37,Twokinds,It's just taking forever to do all the changes
12-02-2018T01:49:52,unsteddyphoenix,Does an editor not do that?
12-02-2018T01:49:56,unsteddyphoenix,Does he not...edit?
12-02-2018T01:50:26,Bgrmystr2,I would assume that would be their job to do so.. o.O
12-02-2018T01:50:40,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s a point there
12-02-2018T01:52:20,SpazztasticKiwi,But no one’s perfect either
12-02-2018T01:53:27,Twokinds,I have the master files. They just review the pages and give me a text file of the issues.
12-02-2018T01:54:15,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh I see.
12-02-2018T01:54:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Time and effort is a necessary investment
12-02-2018T01:55:00,unsteddyphoenix,How tedious though
12-02-2018T01:55:04,unsteddyphoenix,Good luck!
12-02-2018T01:55:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"For whatever you love, there’s something you don’t, but good luck 🍀"
12-02-2018T01:57:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t know if I’m hungry or just bored
12-02-2018T01:58:04,unsteddyphoenix,Eat either way~
12-02-2018T01:59:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"As cliche as it is, I’m trying to lose weight not gain it"
12-02-2018T01:59:54,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh
12-02-2018T02:00:04,unsteddyphoenix,Then dont eat either way :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
12-02-2018T02:00:13,unsteddyphoenix,(nailed it)
12-02-2018T02:00:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"I just had dinner, so I think I’m just bored"
12-02-2018T02:01:57,unsteddyphoenix,I know the feeling
12-02-2018T02:02:09,unsteddyphoenix,But im closer to the opposite weight problem so I just eat
12-02-2018T02:02:38,SpazztasticKiwi,What’s your favorite food?
12-02-2018T02:03:16,unsteddyphoenix,hmm~
12-02-2018T02:03:33,unsteddyphoenix,"As profoundly boring as it is i'd probably say like, pizza."
12-02-2018T02:03:45,unsteddyphoenix,It's so simple and easy but so good~
12-02-2018T02:04:02,unsteddyphoenix,"Especially like, actual italian pizza."
12-02-2018T02:04:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t blame you. I like it too. I’m also a seafood person
12-02-2018T02:05:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"I want to try oysters but I also don’t, you know?"
12-02-2018T02:05:10,unsteddyphoenix,They look so slimey~
12-02-2018T02:05:19,unsteddyphoenix,I think I have tried once and wasnt a fan
12-02-2018T02:05:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"What did it taste like? Salty, slimy?"
12-02-2018T02:06:40,unsteddyphoenix,I dont remember that well only that I wasnt a fan...the texture was as unpleasant as it looks though. I remember that.
12-02-2018T02:07:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Ew. I’ve heard some parts of the world eat boiled fertilized duck eggs
12-02-2018T02:08:10,unsteddyphoenix,FERTILIZED oh god.
12-02-2018T02:08:17,unsteddyphoenix,"I believe it, but agh"
12-02-2018T02:08:49,unsteddyphoenix,Thats pretty sickening
12-02-2018T02:08:56,unsteddyphoenix,Why isnt PETA up in arm
12-02-2018T02:09:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"I can understand and respect others’ cultures, but I’d pass on that"
12-02-2018T02:09:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I do want to try real sushi
12-02-2018T02:10:17,unsteddyphoenix,"Like, made in japan?"
12-02-2018T02:10:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Or made by a certified chef
12-02-2018T02:10:47,unsteddyphoenix,Japan approved tm
12-02-2018T02:11:02,unsteddyphoenix,Show sushi credentials
12-02-2018T02:11:05,unsteddyphoenix,I feel that
12-02-2018T02:11:34,Bgrmystr2,"Kiwi, not eating doesn't automatically make you lose weight, just FYI :o"
12-02-2018T02:11:41,Twokinds,ikidakimasu!
12-02-2018T02:11:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"Bless you, Tom"
12-02-2018T02:11:58,unsteddyphoenix,sugoi sushi
12-02-2018T02:12:12,Bgrmystr2,cuz your body will go into malnurishment-mode and convert muscle to fat in order to conserve energy and survive longer
12-02-2018T02:12:17,unsteddyphoenix,I swear everyone I know (including me) wants to visit japan
12-02-2018T02:12:34,Bgrmystr2,"yeh, I wanna visit too xD"
12-02-2018T02:12:44,unsteddyphoenix,At this point I could probably muster a millennial army
12-02-2018T02:12:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"I know about the not eating thing. I’m watching how much I eat, and what it is"
12-02-2018T02:13:04,Twokinds,Don't eat at all. That'll help you lose weight.
12-02-2018T02:13:07,Bgrmystr2,tom pls xD
12-02-2018T02:13:20,Twokinds,All of it.
12-02-2018T02:13:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"And yes, I’d like to try ikidakimasu."
12-02-2018T02:13:55,Bgrmystr2,"it's important to watch your slow carbs intake, cuz fast carbs you can burn off"
12-02-2018T02:14:09,Twokinds,Eh just eat less.
12-02-2018T02:14:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"Technically, you don’t have to eat for the rest of your life. You would starve to death, but it would be the rest of your life"
12-02-2018T02:14:22,unsteddyphoenix,Your way requires all this gross THINKING bgr
12-02-2018T02:14:24,Bgrmystr2,xDD That's not healthy tom!
12-02-2018T02:14:27,Twokinds,Less in than out.
12-02-2018T02:14:38,Bgrmystr2,yeh phoenix god forbid :V
12-02-2018T02:15:12,Twokinds,Eh it's not unhealthy.
12-02-2018T02:15:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"I work with an 80/20 plan - 80% good, 20% cheat stuff. It’s worked so far"
12-02-2018T02:16:05,unsteddyphoenix,"From what I understand of americans ""eating less"" is probably right"
12-02-2018T02:16:11,Bgrmystr2,lool
12-02-2018T02:16:18,unsteddyphoenix,Your portion sizes are huuge
12-02-2018T02:16:41,Bgrmystr2,"for most people, that would apply"
12-02-2018T02:17:00,Bgrmystr2,a lot of people in the US are overweight
12-02-2018T02:17:13,Bgrmystr2,I dunno how MUCH overweight
12-02-2018T02:17:24,Twokinds,I once only ate 1400 calories / day. Lost weight.
12-02-2018T02:17:41,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s a thing I control too. I used to be considered nearly obese at 167 pounds
12-02-2018T02:18:09,unsteddyphoenix,I suppose that would do it
12-02-2018T02:18:35,SpazztasticKiwi,High school was not fun
12-02-2018T02:18:36,Bgrmystr2,167 lbs..? Obese?
12-02-2018T02:18:36,unsteddyphoenix,Hmm...thats 75kg...are you short or something?
12-02-2018T02:18:54,Bgrmystr2,probably short
12-02-2018T02:19:07,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I'm 5'7 about 180 and I'm not even remotely considered fat."
12-02-2018T02:19:29,Bgrmystr2,so one would have to be pretty short to consider 167 obese
12-02-2018T02:20:08,unsteddyphoenix,I think there is a difference between men and women too
12-02-2018T02:20:24,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah, but that's not obese level"
12-02-2018T02:20:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’ve been told I’m anything from 5”4 - 5”6, so I don’t know for sure, though I’d put my belief on 5”5"
12-02-2018T02:20:55,unsteddyphoenix,Were you shorter in HS?
12-02-2018T02:21:16,Bgrmystr2,that's a thing too
12-02-2018T02:21:28,Twokinds,"5'8"" 180. I'd like to get back down to 170."
12-02-2018T02:21:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"Nope, stopped growing at 16"
12-02-2018T02:22:12,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh I see.
12-02-2018T02:23:05,unsteddyphoenix,"Im 5""11 and 132 pounds so im probably the most unhealthy one here ~"
12-02-2018T02:23:13,Bgrmystr2,xD shit
12-02-2018T02:23:18,Bgrmystr2,you must be a twig
12-02-2018T02:23:22,zolstarym,Want to hear a cool secret to weight loss?
12-02-2018T02:23:23,unsteddyphoenix,So skinny I could be in Twokinds :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
12-02-2018T02:23:27,zolstarym,Parasitic tapeworms
12-02-2018T02:23:29,SpazztasticKiwi,You weigh less than I do now
12-02-2018T02:23:31,Bgrmystr2,LOL Phoenix
12-02-2018T02:23:42,Bgrmystr2,you're two kinds of skinny :V
12-02-2018T02:23:51,unsteddyphoenix,Hah
12-02-2018T02:24:07,unsteddyphoenix,Strategic tapeworms sound nice and easy
12-02-2018T02:24:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Pun pun pun
12-02-2018T02:24:22,unsteddyphoenix,I'll go to the gym EVENTUALLY probably
12-02-2018T02:24:37,Bgrmystr2,I'm not sure how you weigh so little other than just being super skinny
12-02-2018T02:24:55,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah idk. I dont feel I look...THAT bad.
12-02-2018T02:25:14,Bgrmystr2,cuz I've got very little fat and what muscle I do have puts me at 180
12-02-2018T02:25:24,Bgrmystr2,"You've got neither, maybe? :u"
12-02-2018T02:25:41,unsteddyphoenix,"Well yeah, thats a given"
12-02-2018T02:25:48,Bgrmystr2,Stop being a twig
12-02-2018T02:25:49,Bgrmystr2,&gt;:T
12-02-2018T02:25:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Whispers: aliens
12-02-2018T02:25:57,unsteddyphoenix,Eating is haaaard though~
12-02-2018T02:26:02,Bgrmystr2,no is not!
12-02-2018T02:26:08,Bgrmystr2,go to mcdonalds
12-02-2018T02:26:11,Bgrmystr2,order whopper
12-02-2018T02:26:13,Bgrmystr2,walk home
12-02-2018T02:26:17,Bgrmystr2,eat whopper
12-02-2018T02:26:18,unsteddyphoenix,Our largest size is your smallest
12-02-2018T02:26:22,Bgrmystr2,lool
12-02-2018T02:26:25,SpazztasticKiwi,McDonald’s has the Big Mac
12-02-2018T02:26:26,Bgrmystr2,order three then!
12-02-2018T02:26:30,unsteddyphoenix,"Also that's like, one of those money things"
12-02-2018T02:26:37,Bgrmystr2,"I don't know, Kiwi, I don't eat burgers."
12-02-2018T02:26:45,unsteddyphoenix,I dont know how that stuff works I avoid it
12-02-2018T02:26:52,Bgrmystr2,"Mcdonalds had the whopper, didn't it?"
12-02-2018T02:26:57,Bgrmystr2,or was that burger king?
12-02-2018T02:27:00,Bgrmystr2,fuck if I know
12-02-2018T02:27:02,Bgrmystr2,:/
12-02-2018T02:27:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Burger King
12-02-2018T02:27:06,unsteddyphoenix,Apart from spending money on emotes and patreon like an addict
12-02-2018T02:27:11,Bgrmystr2,"well ok, close enough"
12-02-2018T02:27:20,Bgrmystr2,they're both pretty bad foodstuffs to begin with so it'
12-02-2018T02:27:28,Bgrmystr2,it's* not like it changes much which one you get
12-02-2018T02:27:43,unsteddyphoenix,From what I understand I need to start workign out again and take some protein powder
12-02-2018T02:27:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I wouldn’t eat at McDonald’s. I know what it’s like behind the counter
12-02-2018T02:28:04,Bgrmystr2,I don't wanna know
12-02-2018T02:28:05,unsteddyphoenix,Oh god dont scare me like that it's theonly thing that's open at 3am
12-02-2018T02:28:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"Dude, out closes at 11"
12-02-2018T02:28:54,unsteddyphoenix,Your stoners must wander the midnight streets lost and afraid
12-02-2018T02:28:57,unsteddyphoenix,And hungry
12-02-2018T02:28:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Only thing open over here at 3 is Taco Bell and Walmart
12-02-2018T02:29:16,unsteddyphoenix,"Man, im so jealous of those places~"
12-02-2018T02:29:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Weeds illegal here
12-02-2018T02:29:30,unsteddyphoenix,I hear such good stories~
12-02-2018T02:29:45,unsteddyphoenix,Same here but we're not very strict about it
12-02-2018T02:30:03,Bgrmystr2,not everywhere in the US though
12-02-2018T02:30:11,Bgrmystr2,some states legalized it for medical reasons
12-02-2018T02:30:37,Bgrmystr2,at least someone out there has the mind to actually control the shit rather than fail to fight it.
12-02-2018T02:30:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t live anywhere around them either
12-02-2018T02:32:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Can’t smoke anyway - my dad smoked and now my lungs suck sometimes
12-02-2018T02:32:53,unsteddyphoenix,Unfortunate. Well youre not really missing much
12-02-2018T02:33:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Never appealed to me anyway
12-02-2018T02:33:36,Bgrmystr2,"yeah those are different, Kiwi"
12-02-2018T02:34:15,Bgrmystr2,weed doesn't destroy your lungs like cigarettes do.
12-02-2018T02:34:49,Bgrmystr2,the tar is the problem
12-02-2018T02:35:05,Bgrmystr2,"my grandparents smoked, so did my mother's ex"
12-02-2018T02:35:14,Bgrmystr2,and my friend's parents too
12-02-2018T02:35:28,Bgrmystr2,"noone in my house, thankfully"
12-02-2018T02:36:57,SpazztasticKiwi,How’s your progress Tom?
12-02-2018T02:39:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"Weed just doesn’t appeal to me. I have nothing against it, it’s just a neutral thing to me"
12-02-2018T02:40:27,Bgrmystr2,"same, basically"
12-02-2018T02:40:49,Bgrmystr2,cigarettes I have many things against.
12-02-2018T02:40:52,unsteddyphoenix,"Ive tried it a few times, only one time it had an effect and it made me fall asleep"
12-02-2018T02:40:53,Bgrmystr2,"Weed, not so much."
12-02-2018T02:41:15,unsteddyphoenix,"So, I think placebos might be involved amongst the people who dont take it medically."
12-02-2018T02:41:39,Bgrmystr2,it also depends on the quality and amount
12-02-2018T02:41:41,Twokinds,I finally managed to get through all the corrections.
12-02-2018T02:41:46,Bgrmystr2,nice
12-02-2018T02:41:49,Bgrmystr2,that was quick
12-02-2018T02:41:55,Bgrmystr2,"least, seemed quick"
12-02-2018T02:41:59,Twokinds,Well I've been working on it all day
12-02-2018T02:42:24,Twokinds,It's only a first pass too
12-02-2018T02:42:33,Twokinds,Now I'll be going back through and reading every panel
12-02-2018T02:42:51,unsteddyphoenix,Is that the last thing to do?
12-02-2018T02:42:59,unsteddyphoenix,Youve redrawn all the panels that you need to right?
12-02-2018T02:43:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"You’re like desk job stuff person, huh?"
12-02-2018T02:44:13,Twokinds,Pretty much
12-02-2018T02:44:42,Twokinds,"If I have time, I'll fix up some panels I feel are a little derpy"
12-02-2018T02:45:13,Twokinds,"I'm not redoing any art in the comics, but if there's art flubs, I'll try to correct them."
12-02-2018T02:45:59,Bgrmystr2,"Welp, I've just been in formed that it's officially Mardi Gras."
12-02-2018T02:46:01,Bgrmystr2,as of today
12-02-2018T02:46:01,unsteddyphoenix,Close to the home stretch~
12-02-2018T02:46:11,Bgrmystr2,so Happy Mardi Gras or somethin :u
12-02-2018T02:46:16,unsteddyphoenix,I wanna steal that celebration
12-02-2018T02:46:19,Bgrmystr2,not that anyone here celebrates
12-02-2018T02:46:31,Bgrmystr2,you can still some of it
12-02-2018T02:46:33,Bgrmystr2,go ahead
12-02-2018T02:46:42,Bgrmystr2,it's unbelievably crazy
12-02-2018T02:46:49,Bgrmystr2,both good and bad
12-02-2018T02:46:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"I want to go to the parade, but that crowd gets batty"
12-02-2018T02:47:05,Bgrmystr2,eeeyup
12-02-2018T02:47:09,Twokinds,I'll show an example if you like
12-02-2018T02:47:22,Bgrmystr2,sure :o
12-02-2018T02:49:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Shoot
12-02-2018T02:49:37,unsteddyphoenix,interest piqued
12-02-2018T02:49:41,CrimsonHelsing,same
12-02-2018T02:52:33,Twokinds,https://www.dropbox.com/s/wfaj720gvz70574/nobleEric.png
12-02-2018T02:52:54,Twokinds,web v book version
12-02-2018T02:53:46,unsteddyphoenix,He's so noble~
12-02-2018T02:54:28,Twokinds,"Eric's face was a bit uneven, so it's been shifted just a little."
12-02-2018T02:55:24,unsteddyphoenix,I see that
12-02-2018T02:55:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"He’s a charmer, isn’t he?"
12-02-2018T02:55:41,Bgrmystr2,yeah
12-02-2018T02:55:46,CrimsonHelsing,I see. it always did look kinda funny
12-02-2018T02:55:51,unsteddyphoenix,"I definitely appreciate the speech bubble updates, that's so much better."
12-02-2018T02:55:53,Bgrmystr2,"Dat japanese wave painting reference though, tom XD"
12-02-2018T02:55:54,CrimsonHelsing,sharp eye!
12-02-2018T02:56:14,CrimsonHelsing,and really bgr? o.o huh.
12-02-2018T02:56:23,Twokinds,"Yeah, I feel like it reads a lot better."
12-02-2018T02:56:51,unsteddyphoenix,Defintely
12-02-2018T02:56:57,Bgrmystr2,How do you mean? The text wasn't changed. Did moving the text bubbles change how the comic is read..?
12-02-2018T02:57:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I like the colors
12-02-2018T02:57:46,Bgrmystr2,"I don't notice a difference other than placement, and the way the bubble kinda spikes out"
12-02-2018T02:58:34,SpazztasticKiwi,The style kind of suggests movement for me
12-02-2018T02:58:39,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering: I guess I read a lot of manga so I adapt easily. Maybe tis why I don't see a significant difference.
12-02-2018T02:59:28,Twokinds,All the bubbles have been changed
12-02-2018T02:59:50,Bgrmystr2,I sorta miss the old classic super spikey ones xD
12-02-2018T03:00:02,Bgrmystr2,but I guess those should be saved for super loud yelling and stuff
12-02-2018T03:00:06,Bgrmystr2,or something
12-02-2018T03:00:21,unsteddyphoenix,The main thing is the shape changes
12-02-2018T03:00:48,unsteddyphoenix,Also I like that one line on the mountain that's been added for solidarity
12-02-2018T03:03:27,Twokinds,My bubbles are a lot rounder these days with more padding for easier reading.
12-02-2018T03:03:36,Twokinds,For example:
12-02-2018T03:03:38,Twokinds,https://www.dropbox.com/s/ve6zmclz9sy01md/bbble.png
12-02-2018T03:05:02,Bgrmystr2,oooh yeah a lot of bubble changes here
12-02-2018T03:05:06,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah the dialogue feels a lot less constrictive by comparison
12-02-2018T03:05:33,CrimsonHelsing,agreed
12-02-2018T03:05:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Feels smoother
12-02-2018T03:06:12,Twokinds,"I also use bold and italics a lot more. For some reason, I was really reluctant to use it for a long time. Even when people were shouting."
12-02-2018T03:06:16,Twokinds,I'm not sure why.
12-02-2018T03:06:47,unsteddyphoenix,Huh. That's very common in comics.
12-02-2018T03:08:09,Bgrmystr2,Some comics overuse it
12-02-2018T03:08:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Fear of overuse/improper use?
12-02-2018T03:08:26,Bgrmystr2,yeah
12-02-2018T03:08:28,Twokinds,Well yeah.
12-02-2018T03:08:34,Twokinds,You don't wanna go full Miller
12-02-2018T03:08:58,Bgrmystr2,a lot of comics seem to bold / italic words that aren't actually the ones that should be stressed if you said it vocally
12-02-2018T03:09:04,Bgrmystr2,and that takes away from the statement
12-02-2018T03:09:21,Twokinds,That's more 90's early 2000's though
12-02-2018T03:09:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Or confuses you as to what’s going on
12-02-2018T03:09:23,Twokinds,I never got that.
12-02-2018T03:10:01,unsteddyphoenix,now that you mention it...i have noticed that
12-02-2018T03:10:22,unsteddyphoenix,It 's really distracting every time
12-02-2018T03:10:27,unsteddyphoenix,So much that I dwell on it a bit
12-02-2018T03:11:20,Twokinds,I try to be careful with it.
12-02-2018T03:12:05,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s also there for you to use in conveying what the story is/what’s going on
12-02-2018T03:12:49,unsteddyphoenix,Ive seen people use bold just to highlight important pro-nouns
12-02-2018T03:13:13,CrimsonHelsing,"well tbh, I hate to miss out on more info from this chat, but I need to get some rest"
12-02-2018T03:13:25,Twokinds,Oh
12-02-2018T03:13:28,unsteddyphoenix,Important grammar talks
12-02-2018T03:13:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Gn
12-02-2018T03:13:37,unsteddyphoenix,Gnight man
12-02-2018T03:13:51,CrimsonHelsing,and I think you're right unsteddy o.o
12-02-2018T03:13:57,Twokinds,Night
12-02-2018T03:14:02,CrimsonHelsing,ttyl guys
12-02-2018T03:14:14,Bgrmystr2,gnight crimson
12-02-2018T03:14:37,Twokinds,The other day I was going through some of my old files on my old PC and found something I thought was very interesting. A very early draft of chapter 11.
12-02-2018T03:15:05,Twokinds,"It must have been way back. A lot of it was the same, but there were some big differences too."
12-02-2018T03:15:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m listening
12-02-2018T03:15:27,unsteddyphoenix,Oooh!
12-02-2018T03:15:44,unsteddyphoenix,That's very interesting
12-02-2018T03:15:49,unsteddyphoenix,"Imagine ""very"" in italics"
12-02-2018T03:15:52,unsteddyphoenix,Is it sharable?
12-02-2018T03:15:55,Twokinds,"For example, Keith actually does stab himself to stop from killing Natani."
12-02-2018T03:16:14,unsteddyphoenix,Dramatic!
12-02-2018T03:16:36,Twokinds,"Natani has to go for help naked, but Laura doesn't recognize Natani, due to womanliness."
12-02-2018T03:17:09,Bgrmystr2,:O
12-02-2018T03:17:15,Bgrmystr2,This sounds amazing
12-02-2018T03:17:18,Twokinds,Eric apparently was going to heal Keith(?) I guess using magic.
12-02-2018T03:17:23,Bgrmystr2,I wanna read this now
12-02-2018T03:17:39,Twokinds,He can't really do that. I can see why it was cut. Maybe a magic artifact.
12-02-2018T03:17:46,unsteddyphoenix,Brother illegally taught him spells maybe?
12-02-2018T03:17:55,Bgrmystr2,Eric can't use magic? :thinking:
12-02-2018T03:18:07,unsteddyphoenix,Theres no reason he'd be able to
12-02-2018T03:18:11,Twokinds,Very basic magic. Healing is hard. it's a whole school.
12-02-2018T03:18:17,Twokinds,You gotta get a degree and everything.
12-02-2018T03:18:38,Bgrmystr2,"wooah, you can't just use it willy nilly eh?"
12-02-2018T03:18:44,Bgrmystr2,that's interesting
12-02-2018T03:18:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Eric strikes me as a curious reader. Maybe he got ahold of something concerning
12-02-2018T03:19:01,Twokinds,"Anyway, then it goes on about the same"
12-02-2018T03:19:05,Twokinds,They take the three bridges.
12-02-2018T03:19:09,unsteddyphoenix,I can see him eccentrically buying magic items a la clovis
12-02-2018T03:19:17,Twokinds,But Natani and Flora find the Arms General already dead.
12-02-2018T03:19:57,unsteddyphoenix,Right
12-02-2018T03:20:24,Twokinds,Then it's about the same. Alaric falls. The king is revealed.
12-02-2018T03:20:43,Twokinds,"Keith throws a dagger at the towers weak point, which destroys it."
12-02-2018T03:20:55,zolstarym,Wow. That story line is 8 years old now. Seems like it happened way sooner
12-02-2018T03:20:58,unsteddyphoenix,Kind of takes away the severity of impalings if two characters survive it
12-02-2018T03:21:09,Twokinds,I... uh... can see why I changed that. It's a bit anticlimactic.
12-02-2018T03:22:09,Twokinds,And the chapter ends with King Adelaide dying!
12-02-2018T03:22:14,unsteddyphoenix,!!!!!
12-02-2018T03:22:15,unsteddyphoenix,DISLIKE
12-02-2018T03:22:25,unsteddyphoenix,Thats VERY different
12-02-2018T03:22:42,SpazztasticKiwi,😐
12-02-2018T03:22:57,unsteddyphoenix,Also the most unrealistic thing is that Keith is a basitin so he'd probably just walk off the wound
12-02-2018T03:23:03,Twokinds,"Yeah, very different. Oriignally the conflict was that the king's life was literally tied to the tower."
12-02-2018T03:23:39,Twokinds,I think that's why I eventually wrote that jab about Adelaide 'tragicly surviving' later on.
12-02-2018T03:24:07,Bgrmystr2,hahaha that was a win line.
12-02-2018T03:24:13,Bgrmystr2,"""Tragically, I survived."""
12-02-2018T03:24:29,Bgrmystr2,"Man, that was a brutally effective one-liner."
12-02-2018T03:24:53,Twokinds,It's interesting sometimes what ends up on the cutting room floor.
12-02-2018T03:28:25,Twokinds,"Anyway, I am going to end up on the floor if I don't get to bed soon. G'night!"
12-02-2018T03:28:34,unsteddyphoenix,byee~
12-02-2018T03:28:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Good night 💤
12-02-2018T03:29:08,Bgrmystr2,gnight tom

12-02-2018T08:20:47,RedDeath2018,As much as I Could read the original storyline was dark
12-02-2018T08:20:54,RedDeath2018,And good morning
12-02-2018T08:51:22,NightMeaty22,Good morning red
12-02-2018T09:18:25,qwe304,"what ""original story?"
12-02-2018T09:46:23,TheBeckoner,From weight loss to weed to older versions of the comic. Man I miss so much when I leave early...
12-02-2018T09:46:58,TheBeckoner,"Also we lost Alaric already, it would've been totally unfair to lose Adelaide!"
12-02-2018T09:47:09,TheBeckoner,Also good morning peples
12-02-2018T09:49:00,TheBeckoner,"Also I didn't know that patreon gallery thing existed @ilar, thanks for posting the link."
12-02-2018T09:49:24,TheBeckoner,Oops i meant @iliar
12-02-2018T09:52:54,iliar,No problem. I created this folder for myself. And I'm glad that someone else it benefits.

12-02-2018T12:23:18,qwe304,"its likely due to you waking up in the middle of deep sleep, do you wake up with an alarm and or have an irregular sleep sceduelle?"

12-02-2018T12:26:03,qwe304,"does the alarm usually wake you up, or do you wake up before it?"
12-02-2018T12:27:06,Terryschannel,Hi tom
12-02-2018T12:27:20,Terryschannel,No lurking today!

12-02-2018T12:31:45,MidnightBlue78,Around 5am
12-02-2018T12:33:36,qwe304,"if you fall asleep at a regular time, you should be able to wake up naturally on your own after a few months, i always wake up at 6:50 +/- 5 min, right before my alarm"
12-02-2018T12:34:02,qwe304,the body doesn't like being jarred from deep sleep
12-02-2018T12:37:18,MidnightBlue78,I dont have a regular time to go to bed
12-02-2018T12:39:39,qwe304,you should try to always go to bed within a 1 hour window
12-02-2018T12:40:18,qwe304,"if you are able to, your body will settle into a schedule, and you will wake up more refreshed, more often"
12-02-2018T12:41:52,MidnightBlue78,I should really start doing that
12-02-2018T12:42:34,qwe304,"if you cant manage that, see if you can find a smatr watch that will wake you up once you are in lighter sleep"
12-02-2018T12:43:04,qwe304,"on my pebble, i can set a 30 minute window, and it will wake me up when my sleep is lightest"
12-02-2018T12:44:41,SpazztasticKiwi,My sister woke me up today
12-02-2018T12:46:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Took me ten minutes to realize that smell was pancakes

12-02-2018T18:27:34,RedDeath2018,The crying part was trying to be humorous usually I just sit around doing nothing wishing I had a girlfriend
12-02-2018T18:27:55,MidnightBlue78,"yeah, i'm being humorous too"
12-02-2018T18:28:14,MidnightBlue78,"I have dark humor, which a lot of people dont really get"
12-02-2018T18:28:23,MidnightBlue78,"Well, mostly everyone"
12-02-2018T18:28:36,RedDeath2018,My humor just comes out as I speak
12-02-2018T18:29:11,RedDeath2018,"I even make my mom laugh once in awhile, and that’s impossible for the ordinary person"
12-02-2018T18:29:24,Bgrmystr2,I don't wish I had a girlfriend. I've seen the garbage it comes with
12-02-2018T18:29:27,Bgrmystr2,I'll pass.

12-02-2018T18:30:14,MidnightBlue78,please explain further
12-02-2018T18:30:29,MidnightBlue78,I always thought it was the other way around
12-02-2018T18:30:57,TheBeckoner,Either sex is capable of being a dick.
12-02-2018T18:31:00,RedDeath2018,I don’t have much experienced with love but I’m pretty sure that’s what he meant
12-02-2018T18:32:33,Bgrmystr2,"What Beck says is true. It's not just girls, or just guys. People are stupid and obsessive. Having a significant other comes with a lot of garbage"
12-02-2018T18:32:40,Bgrmystr2,garbage I just don't really need right now.
12-02-2018T18:33:01,MidnightBlue78,"well, dont look in the trash bin"

12-02-2018T18:51:38,JaydenMozingo,I ate American modified Mexican food. Why does America have to modify EVERY food we come across?!?!?!

12-02-2018T18:52:51,JaydenMozingo,"Chinese, Mexican, French, Italian, and just about every other kind of food. We deep fry them and add half a ton of sauces to the mix"
12-02-2018T18:53:00,MidnightBlue78,ground beef and spaghetti sauce
12-02-2018T18:53:12,MidnightBlue78,I made the meatballs from scratch

12-02-2018T18:54:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok 🤨
12-02-2018T18:54:33,Bgrmystr2,I dunno why you expect food in the US to be exactly the same as food elsewhere inthe world.
12-02-2018T18:54:37,MidnightBlue78,RIP jays toliet
12-02-2018T18:54:42,Bgrmystr2,No food is exactly the same

12-02-2018T18:55:41,Bgrmystr2,not expecting to see anything ;o
12-02-2018T18:55:45,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s why I want to go try sushi in a place owned by someone native to and certified in the craft
12-02-2018T18:55:49,TheBeckoner,He was here at around 2:30 this morning.
12-02-2018T18:55:57,Bgrmystr2,"again, last night."
12-02-2018T18:56:04,TheBeckoner,Lol Bgr
12-02-2018T18:56:10,JaydenMozingo,"I'm not saying we should keep it the same, I'm just saying that we change it a bit TOO much. Then don't give alot of credit to the people who made the original food."
12-02-2018T18:56:50,SpazztasticKiwi,This is true. I’ve seen cooked sushi. Tell me what’s wrong with that sentence
12-02-2018T18:56:53,Bgrmystr2,"once you change something enough, it ceases to be the original thing, and is now simply based on the thing."
12-02-2018T18:57:01,Bgrmystr2,there's nothing wrong with making something new
12-02-2018T18:57:13,MidnightBlue78,fried sushi is pretty good actually
12-02-2018T18:57:24,JaydenMozingo,"I mean, I bet somewhere in Japan, they have a Form of pizza, but they keep it real and give original makers the credit"
12-02-2018T18:57:28,JaydenMozingo,Yeah
12-02-2018T18:57:28,Bgrmystr2,you're probably looking for something that isn't there.
12-02-2018T18:57:31,MidnightBlue78,Its the only sushi i'll eat
12-02-2018T18:57:53,TheBeckoner,Eat Soylent my dudes

12-02-2018T18:58:08,JaydenMozingo,"Making something new is amazing, but we tend to Re-define the food"
12-02-2018T18:58:09,Bgrmystr2,"Jay, I don't know if you know how food works, but food, just like art, is not black and white. It's made in metaphorical greys."
12-02-2018T18:58:18,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s a place that sells “American style” pizza with mayonnaise and peas on it
12-02-2018T18:58:24,TheBeckoner,Ew
12-02-2018T18:58:43,Bgrmystr2,We are not the only country that does that.
12-02-2018T18:58:55,Bgrmystr2,and food is not the only thing that it happens to
12-02-2018T18:58:55,JaydenMozingo,You have a point there.
12-02-2018T18:59:17,JaydenMozingo,"Anyway, I'm off to my 'throne'"

12-02-2018T19:00:18,TheBeckoner,Tom is a sushi
12-02-2018T19:00:47,Bgrmystr2,"I don't like peas at all, and I don't think I would consider that a stereotypical pizza"
12-02-2018T19:00:59,Bgrmystr2,"but if that's what ppl want on a pizza bread, then have at it"
12-02-2018T19:01:01,Bgrmystr2,do not want.

12-02-2018T21:50:09,Twokinds,What's that?
12-02-2018T21:50:23,BluePhantom90,that would be a no
12-02-2018T21:50:27,JaydenMozingo,Drawing software similar to Photoshop
12-02-2018T21:50:37,JaydenMozingo,"But you know, its not"

12-02-2018T21:51:24,JaydenMozingo,Did it feel a little shaky on making lines
12-02-2018T21:51:53,Twokinds,"Yes, horrible."
12-02-2018T21:51:59,Twokinds,That's why I've never used it.
12-02-2018T21:52:07,JaydenMozingo,"Because when I use, it, I can't outline a character without messing up."

12-02-2018T21:53:31,JaydenMozingo,I'll try that real quick
12-02-2018T21:53:46,DatabaseError,"""paying for photoshop"" kek"

12-02-2018T22:06:02,BluePhantom90,"Do wonder Tom id you would make your own Discord chat, I mean your brother made a Discord chat.... Which was a huge mistake to make a ""Scream Room"" talk channel."

12-02-2018T22:11:57,Bgrmystr2,this is not anything new
12-02-2018T22:11:59,unsteddyphoenix,It's actually absurd. I get away with a lot too but Tom is on another level.
12-02-2018T22:12:00,Bgrmystr2,this is very common
12-02-2018T22:13:27,unsteddyphoenix,Hoo...im watching someone make some pretty cool Twokinds fanart with Nero
12-02-2018T22:13:39,BluePhantom90,"just saying what discord is, I know Tom Knows and just Trolling."
12-02-2018T22:14:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"My definition of discord is what I feel it is. I’m sure it has actual uses, but I haven’t delved in deep enough to tell"
12-02-2018T22:14:24,unsteddyphoenix,mhm
12-02-2018T22:14:27,Bgrmystr2,"it's just a IM program with voice support, Kiwi"
12-02-2018T22:14:33,Bgrmystr2,there is no other definition
12-02-2018T22:15:01,SpazztasticKiwi,That was also my understanding until I joined mark’s. Then I discovered a new definition: hell
12-02-2018T22:15:10,zolstarym,Pfft everyone knows who discord is. Discord is a chaotic character featured in my little pony.
12-02-2018T22:15:18,Bgrmystr2,Zol pls
12-02-2018T22:15:22,TheBeckoner,"Yeah, it's an interesting art style Steddy."
12-02-2018T22:15:50,unsteddyphoenix,Evil trace looks very menacing~
12-02-2018T22:16:06,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah if Tom made a big discord it'd just be a mess along those lines
12-02-2018T22:16:15,unsteddyphoenix,Probably not as bad as Marks but
12-02-2018T22:16:26,TheBeckoner,I hope they add the blue triangle
12-02-2018T22:16:34,TheBeckoner,lol nvm

12-02-2018T22:17:53,BluePhantom90,lol Markiplier made the screaming room which was a huge mistake. e-e Plus a lot of people spam his chat. So its kinda eh. The Admin have their work cut out for them
12-02-2018T22:18:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I feel right at home in Mark's discord
12-02-2018T22:18:42,unsteddyphoenix,Thats a warning sign right there
12-02-2018T22:18:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,especially in the bathroom
12-02-2018T22:19:45,MidnightBlue78,I joined his discord
12-02-2018T22:19:54,MidnightBlue78,Left two minutes later
12-02-2018T22:20:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I essentially gave up on it and made my own. For chatting with my friends and anyone who wants to drop in. It’s more chill
12-02-2018T22:20:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Neon and I have been hiding in the trenches for a few days now
12-02-2018T22:20:50,unsteddyphoenix,behind enemy lines?
12-02-2018T22:20:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,its a little chaotic
12-02-2018T22:21:21,BluePhantom90,there are other discord chats that are fun
12-02-2018T22:21:35,Twokinds,Who's Markiplier?

12-02-2018T22:24:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Then I tried one of his videos and boy was I shook
12-02-2018T22:24:17,JaydenMozingo,lol
12-02-2018T22:24:34,MidnightBlue78,math tutoring?

12-02-2018T22:24:44,unsteddyphoenix,multiplier?
12-02-2018T22:24:51,Bgrmystr2,is that Mark doing math?
12-02-2018T22:24:53,Bgrmystr2,:v
12-02-2018T22:25:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Because it sounds like a combination of Mark and multiplier
12-02-2018T22:25:21,MidnightBlue78,"Eh, i guess"
12-02-2018T22:26:32,unsteddyphoenix,How did he even come up with that name
12-02-2018T22:27:13,JaydenMozingo,Mark the multiplier
12-02-2018T22:27:14,MidnightBlue78,Didnt Tom say he came up with it?
12-02-2018T22:27:54,Bgrmystr2,"If Mark was actually doing that, Kiwi, his channel would be Mathiplier."
12-02-2018T22:27:59,unsteddyphoenix,but like...does it mean anything?
12-02-2018T22:28:28,MidnightBlue78,"hmmmm, no clue"
12-02-2018T22:28:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don’t know. Mark rarely talks about him, though when he does it’s always along the lines of  “I love my brother”"
12-02-2018T22:29:49,unsteddyphoenix,what a dork
12-02-2018T22:30:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"Ah, but it makes you want to cry"
12-02-2018T22:31:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Or it does for me at least

12-02-2018T22:39:00,Bgrmystr2,No. It will crawl up his arm and take over his entire body.
12-02-2018T22:39:08,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah he's doomed

12-02-2018T22:40:28,RedDeath2018,That would be a tough choice
12-02-2018T22:40:33,unsteddyphoenix,Tragic irony
12-02-2018T22:40:56,qwe304,*finds out how to make people live longer* *ends up just lenthening the suffering of your soulmate*
12-02-2018T22:41:01,Bgrmystr2,"what's one life sacrifice to the elongation of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands."
12-02-2018T22:41:32,RedDeath2018,True
12-02-2018T22:41:54,RedDeath2018,But the one life can affect multiple people harshly
12-02-2018T22:42:23,Bgrmystr2,"again, it's just one life though"
12-02-2018T22:42:40,Bgrmystr2,any single one life can affect an equal number of lives as any other.
12-02-2018T22:43:01,RedDeath2018,Okie dokie
12-02-2018T22:43:17,Bgrmystr2,they're not valued more simply because it's one vs many
12-02-2018T22:43:42,RedDeath2018,Seriously ima go To sleep I’m really beat
12-02-2018T22:43:56,RedDeath2018,Just wanted to see what y’all were talking about
12-02-2018T22:44:02,Bgrmystr2,"Trace doing that would make many sad, but there's just as many people that will be happy for every single life he's extended."
12-02-2018T22:44:10,RedDeath2018,Night guys see you tomorrow
12-02-2018T22:44:33,Bgrmystr2,gnight red
12-02-2018T22:44:45,BadFoMo,Good night.
12-02-2018T22:45:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Nighty nighty
12-02-2018T22:46:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"I feel Tom’s here to poke us with a stick when we go quiet. *jab, jab* “Do stuff”"
12-02-2018T22:50:33,qwe304,i think its more the other way around
12-02-2018T22:52:25,SpazztasticKiwi,He doesn’t always respond though
12-02-2018T22:52:49,unsteddyphoenix,too busy actually being productive
12-02-2018T22:52:53,unsteddyphoenix,Allegedly.
12-02-2018T22:53:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I have no doubt he’s busy. Course he could also be watching the chat as it happens like a tv program
12-02-2018T22:56:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m just jumping back and forth from Pinterest
12-02-2018T22:57:15,unsteddyphoenix,Ugh pinterest
12-02-2018T22:57:27,unsteddyphoenix,It's like a virus that infected image search
12-02-2018T22:57:45,unsteddyphoenix,Hate it
12-02-2018T22:58:25,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s all in how you use it
12-02-2018T22:59:01,unsteddyphoenix,Oh found an image you like? Better search for it  among  1500 other pictures and also youre not seeing shit without an account~
12-02-2018T23:00:01,unsteddyphoenix,Effective yet evil
12-02-2018T23:01:13,Bgrmystr2,"not really. It's riddled with malware, Kiwi"
12-02-2018T23:02:18,Bgrmystr2,You know how many god damn computers I've come across completely swamped with viruses and malware from pinterest.
12-02-2018T23:02:36,Bgrmystr2,Not a fan
12-02-2018T23:03:13,Bgrmystr2,"there's no way to tell if the image you click has a virus or not, the site itself has no way for you to tell"
12-02-2018T23:03:32,Bgrmystr2,it's just a matter of stuff going on in the background that the user can't see
12-02-2018T23:03:34,Bgrmystr2,terrible site.
12-02-2018T23:04:54,SpazztasticKiwi,App

12-02-2018T23:47:55,unsteddyphoenix,gnight
12-02-2018T23:53:07,Twokinds,Some of these pages really need to be reordered...
12-02-2018T23:53:32,BadFoMo,Hmm?
12-02-2018T23:53:59,unsteddyphoenix,"Really? Like, different order from the pages up right now?"
12-02-2018T23:54:23,Twokinds,Yeah. just a tiny bit
12-02-2018T23:55:08,BadFoMo,Can you give an example?
12-02-2018T23:55:21,Twokinds,"There's some scene transitions, particularly with Mike and Evals' gender adventures, that are really sudden, because they're just sorta randomly scattered throughout the chapter."
12-02-2018T23:55:21,unsteddyphoenix,Change is scary~
12-02-2018T23:55:47,Twokinds,"So like, on the left page, you have Alabaster saying Keith has ""ONE HOUR!"" and then on the right, it's Heartbutt Mike."
12-02-2018T23:56:04,Twokinds,"And it's like, wow, this is sudden, since it's the first time Mike's shown up in the book."
12-02-2018T23:56:15,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
12-02-2018T23:56:24,unsteddyphoenix,I see. Downplays the seriousness a bit.
12-02-2018T23:57:12,Twokinds,"Yeah, so I'm just going to move that page and the next one with Mike and Evals to a good transition point a few pages back."
12-02-2018T23:57:41,Twokinds,It's a very minor sort order and doesn't change the order of events any.
12-02-2018T23:58:07,unsteddyphoenix,So more just for flow
12-02-2018T23:58:19,unsteddyphoenix,Im impressed with the amount of thought youre putting into this
12-02-2018T23:59:00,Twokinds,Of course
12-02-2018T23:59:12,Twokinds,I go through and I check to see which pages end up on the left and right
12-02-2018T23:59:17,Twokinds,I try to make sure it flows well
12-02-2018T23:59:57,unsteddyphoenix,Truuue it'll read differently in book form...that's an obvious point I somehow missed
