23-07-2018T01:23:31,Bgrmystr2,I remember you
23-07-2018T01:23:52,Bgrmystr2,"you had a different image that didn't look like potatos, didn't you?"
23-07-2018T01:23:56,Bgrmystr2,or is that the same one?
23-07-2018T01:24:27,Bgrmystr2,Or I guess you could log off &gt;:T :ptv-pouty:

23-07-2018T01:27:27,PotatoRights,Sorry I haven‚Äôt been on
23-07-2018T01:27:40,PotatoRights,I‚Äôve been busy
23-07-2018T01:36:51,Bgrmystr2,It's okay I prolly just don't recall. It's been a while after all
23-07-2018T01:43:31,PotatoRights,Yeah

23-07-2018T13:12:20,iliar,How was ComicCon?
23-07-2018T13:13:28,Twokinds,Exhausting
23-07-2018T13:13:42,Twokinds,I am glad to be back home.
23-07-2018T13:14:17,iliar,Especially after AnthroCon
23-07-2018T13:17:10,iliar,I wonder how many sketches have you painted these days?
23-07-2018T13:19:07,Twokinds,16 for SDCC
23-07-2018T13:20:00,iliar,Hmm ... I thought a lot more.
23-07-2018T13:22:10,iliar,Okay. I found 10/16. Good result.
23-07-2018T13:27:30,Twokinds,I'm getting ready to tweet them all once I get them transfered and cleaned up
23-07-2018T13:29:09,iliar,Nice
23-07-2018T13:34:14,iliar,But cleaning up photo is a hard work and unfortunately the result is not great. Scanning gives a much better result.
23-07-2018T13:34:17,iliar,https://yadi.sk/i/0Tw8WeQl3ZXi2Y
23-07-2018T13:34:27,iliar,But it seems to me impossible to scan all the sketches.
23-07-2018T13:36:02,Dadrobit,"Mmmm, feel a little bad that I didn't go to SDCC, but birthday at home with the family was pretty fun overall anyways."
23-07-2018T13:38:32,Dadrobit,"Gonna head out tomorrow morning to the lake with some jet-skis with family from Hawaii, so that should be pretty good as well."
23-07-2018T13:39:05,Dadrobit,"Though the forecast is pointing at it being 117, so it's probably not going to be all day lol."
23-07-2018T13:40:09,Dadrobit,"Hope you had fun at the con though, crossed fingers that the con crud misses you this time."
23-07-2018T13:43:58,Twokinds,117! Impossible!
23-07-2018T13:49:20,ElvenHunter84,"Next week is the color stream, right?"
23-07-2018T13:52:06,Dadrobit,Not impossible unfortunately. Worst I ever had to deal with was 122. Everything just shuts down for the day.
23-07-2018T13:52:20,Dadrobit,Even the airports stop their traffic.
23-07-2018T13:55:38,Dadrobit,"Just checked, it is currently 113. And barely noon, so that very well may go up another degree or two still."
23-07-2018T14:05:58,Twokinds,I get grumpy when the inside of my house gets to 74
23-07-2018T14:06:13,Twokinds,I cannot imagine having to be out and about in 100+ weather
23-07-2018T14:13:37,Dadrobit,You know that feeling of getting a blast of hot air in your face from standing too close to the oven door when you open it?
23-07-2018T14:13:44,Dadrobit,"It's that, but all over your body."
23-07-2018T14:14:55,Dadrobit,Walking out of the movie theatre in the middle of the day and going from 70 to 110 is actually just demoralizing lol.
23-07-2018T14:16:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Insta sweat
23-07-2018T14:17:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Only supposed to get to 86 for us
23-07-2018T14:20:02,Dadrobit,"I always giggle thinking about King of the Hill's episode where they go to Phoenix when it's 111 out. ""This city should not exist! It is a monument to man's arrogance!"""

23-07-2018T14:28:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"We can get freezing as Antarctica‚Äôs heart but when it decides to heat up, we‚Äôre better prepared"
23-07-2018T14:29:47,SpazztasticKiwi,One snowflake causes apocalyptic chaos. And it‚Äôs only because we can never get a snow time where it actually sticks
23-07-2018T14:43:08,SpazztasticKiwi,You have fun today - don‚Äôt stay out too long in that heat and try not to melt üëåüèª
23-07-2018T14:46:43,Dadrobit,"Oh, don't worry, I'm inside for the rest of the day. Popsicles and work."

23-07-2018T14:54:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Popsicles - internal temp control and moisture

23-07-2018T20:20:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Might be a teensy roadblock for that plan
23-07-2018T20:20:42,unsteddyphoenix,At least there's no more to go to for like...this year

23-07-2018T20:23:45,TheGamePlayer,not true
23-07-2018T20:24:09,Bgrmystr2,very true. things do not think for themselves. Otherwise they are not a thing.
23-07-2018T20:24:21,Bgrmystr2,"unless you think they are, in which you are the one that is wong."
23-07-2018T20:24:23,Bgrmystr2,wrong* even
23-07-2018T20:25:12,TheGamePlayer,well you responded to me soooooo
23-07-2018T20:25:43,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-unimpressed: I am someone. Not something. If you mix the two up, that's just rude."
23-07-2018T20:26:23,TheGamePlayer,i may have not read most of that
23-07-2018T20:26:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"Uh, for research reasons, how many pizzas would it take to fill an ancient dragon queen such as Nora"
23-07-2018T20:26:57,TheGamePlayer,50000000

23-07-2018T20:35:29,Twokinds,Dragons in Twokinds do not need to eat.
23-07-2018T20:35:42,BadFoMo,@SpazztasticKiwi Maybe just one Pizza if she morphed into 'Adrakist' form.
23-07-2018T20:35:51,Bgrmystr2,"but they CAN eat, I bet"
23-07-2018T20:36:01,Twokinds,They instead subsist purely on blushing.
23-07-2018T20:36:05,Bgrmystr2,but would that food turn into magic..?
23-07-2018T20:36:08,Bgrmystr2,xDD wow
23-07-2018T20:36:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Makes sense
23-07-2018T20:36:16,unsteddyphoenix,Themselves or others?
23-07-2018T20:36:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Eat for the taste
23-07-2018T20:36:23,unsteddyphoenix,Or both
23-07-2018T20:36:32,BadFoMo,They do what?
23-07-2018T20:36:44,Twokinds,lol
23-07-2018T20:36:44,SpazztasticKiwi,They feed on secondhand embarrassment
23-07-2018T20:36:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh boy
23-07-2018T20:37:28,Twokinds,First-hand embarrassment is extremely perverse. Reni is actually a deviant.

23-07-2018T20:40:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"Sudden tails would only really be embarrassing if they gave away emotion, like Katana Tail"
23-07-2018T20:41:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Or accidentally caused dress malfunction
23-07-2018T20:41:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless you err on the side of caution and wear shorts underneath dresses and skirts

23-07-2018T20:51:41,CrRAR,how wude
23-07-2018T21:05:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"That oddly tell reminds me - we used to have this elderly lady that came by basically every other day and asked for free samples. It was known she was capable of grocery shopping for herself and all, she just took advantage of the free sample thing a bit"
23-07-2018T21:05:35,Bgrmystr2,one free sample and goaway :u
23-07-2018T21:05:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"Well, we haven‚Äôt seen her in months now, and it‚Äôs been brought up that she may have passed cause she hadn‚Äôt been banned yet"
23-07-2018T21:05:52,Bgrmystr2,"and if it became an everyday thing, I'd have restricted her from getting any at all."
23-07-2018T21:06:40,SpazztasticKiwi,We had a group of kids that do something similar
23-07-2018T21:06:57,Bgrmystr2,I'd feel the same to them
23-07-2018T21:07:05,Bgrmystr2,"it's a store, not a free buffet"
23-07-2018T21:08:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"Only they asked for big stuff like whole chicken breasts. Now, while we‚Äôll portion out some stuff for the sole idea of sampling, they started getting ridiculous cause we knew they were together but it was a different kid each time"
23-07-2018T21:08:40,SpazztasticKiwi,They‚Äôre close to being banned from samples
23-07-2018T21:09:09,Bgrmystr2,they're not already banned? lol
23-07-2018T21:09:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Unfortunately we don‚Äôt have a quick ban hammer
23-07-2018T21:09:29,SpazztasticKiwi,For example
23-07-2018T21:09:53,SpazztasticKiwi,There was a case a month or so ago where a kid was ordering stuff from the deli
23-07-2018T21:10:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"He‚Äôd then go over to another area of the store, eat the stuff, and stash the wrappers, bags, containers, etc"
23-07-2018T21:12:19,SpazztasticKiwi,When they brought us the labels to scan and put in the system to throw away (this was causing shrink and inventory inaccuracies)
23-07-2018T21:13:00,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, that's grounds for arresting that kid"
23-07-2018T21:13:05,Bgrmystr2,cuz that's theft
23-07-2018T21:13:36,SpazztasticKiwi,It amounted to over sixty-ish in chicken alone over the course of maybe a year or six months
23-07-2018T21:13:44,SpazztasticKiwi,He was arrested
23-07-2018T21:13:47,Bgrmystr2,good
23-07-2018T21:13:49,SpazztasticKiwi,But he‚Äôs not banned
23-07-2018T21:14:01,Bgrmystr2,then whoever has that power to do so is stupid
23-07-2018T21:14:02,SpazztasticKiwi,He‚Äôs still allowed to return as a customer
23-07-2018T21:14:31,Bgrmystr2,not banning him is just going to encourage him to do it more &gt;.&gt;
23-07-2018T21:15:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"Like the group of free sample kids, it‚Äôs an odd case"
23-07-2018T21:16:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"See the kids mom I‚Äôve been told was banned for doing the same thing, but it was because she wanted more than what she wanted to pay"
23-07-2018T21:16:30,Bgrmystr2,"no matter the reason, there's always going to be weird shit. But when enough weird shit happens, it, too, becomes the norm."
23-07-2018T21:16:42,Bgrmystr2,"and yeah see, that's the reason why you ban ppl from a store"
23-07-2018T21:17:07,Bgrmystr2,cuz they're not afraid to send their kids to steal so they don't deal with the consequences
23-07-2018T21:17:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I know the kid from hs. He‚Äôs a grade or two behind me
23-07-2018T21:17:16,Bgrmystr2,happens here quite a bit
23-07-2018T21:18:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"He‚Äôs never struck me as malicious or bad, but he also has a very very ‚Äúyes/no ma‚Äôm/sir‚Äù thing and is always polite."
23-07-2018T21:19:09,Bgrmystr2,yeah kids don't always know any better
23-07-2018T21:19:22,SpazztasticKiwi,And we all know how some use that as a way to get away with whatever
23-07-2018T21:21:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"Met the cop that arrested him. Never said any names, but it was understood who he was talking about. Since it was the only matching instance, the fact I don‚Äôt know the name didn‚Äôt matter"
23-07-2018T21:22:15,SpazztasticKiwi,If they seem to feel he‚Äôs not awful enough to keep or be concerned about I guess he‚Äôs worth a second chance being so young
23-07-2018T21:24:28,SpazztasticKiwi,The group of free samples kids also don‚Äôt seem bad - it‚Äôs just the parents appear not to care too much
23-07-2018T21:25:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"While some of them have to be old enough to realize it‚Äôs not good behavior, they still came back"
23-07-2018T23:12:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Whoever‚Äôs still here: what if Scythe gave Nibbly a summer poodle cut?
23-07-2018T23:13:08,SpazztasticKiwi,*Sythe
