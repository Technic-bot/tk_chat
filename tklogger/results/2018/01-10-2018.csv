01-10-2018T14:07:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark tried Korean candy
01-10-2018T14:08:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Might be one of my top videos
01-10-2018T14:29:10,totallynotTrace,But can we trust Jas i mean Tom?
01-10-2018T14:30:16,MidNightBlue78,looks like Tom liked the korean candy üòÅ
01-10-2018T14:30:35,totallynotTrace,even the rubber aka chocolate
01-10-2018T14:45:38,Mippy,Oh my gosh! Tom in Mark‚Äôs newest video. XD
01-10-2018T14:48:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeeeesssss
01-10-2018T14:48:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom enjoying it all and Mark‚Äôs just being saltier than the candy
01-10-2018T14:50:16,SpazztasticKiwi,And mark said he was leaving links to some family members‚Äô social medias. I saw no links
01-10-2018T15:28:09,Bgrmystr2,when mark dropped em all and jason & everyone else clapped I lost my shit :ptv-laugh:
01-10-2018T15:34:08,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI guess I got what I asked for‚Äù got me
01-10-2018T15:34:36,SpazztasticKiwi,And the end ‚Äúwhat are you smiling at? You never smile‚Äù
01-10-2018T15:35:18,Bgrmystr2,haven't finished yet
01-10-2018T15:35:30,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs at the end
01-10-2018T15:35:40,Bgrmystr2,mkay
01-10-2018T15:38:49,Bgrmystr2,xD
01-10-2018T15:39:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Sassiplier was met with a challenger
01-10-2018T15:40:03,Bgrmystr2,yeah sure was
01-10-2018T15:41:29,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúNobody will call you Tom‚Äù excuuuuuse me?
01-10-2018T15:42:14,Bgrmystr2,hahaha
01-10-2018T15:43:24,SpazztasticKiwi,He has a literal fan base that generally calls him Tom exclusively
01-10-2018T15:43:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Their mom‚Äôs a treat
01-10-2018T15:44:25,Bgrmystr2,"I give it to mark, he's a good comedian"
01-10-2018T15:44:32,Bgrmystr2,but his family's got jokes
01-10-2018T15:44:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"To be fair, he may have gotten some if not most of it from Tom"
01-10-2018T15:45:31,SpazztasticKiwi,And being around family for some family joking
01-10-2018T15:46:13,Bgrmystr2,"what are you talking about, he *never smiles* :V"
01-10-2018T15:46:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Me or Mark?
01-10-2018T15:46:34,Bgrmystr2,tom lol
01-10-2018T15:47:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"In the video at the end, Tom‚Äôs evidently smiling off camera at Mark‚Äôs...antics and Mark points it out"
01-10-2018T15:47:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"Like, he‚Äôs probably smiling cause you‚Äôre being a dork, Mark"
01-10-2018T15:49:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"And the way he was opening that candy bag, I was sitting there thinking ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do that, it‚Äôs gonna bus-‚Äú *bag busts open*"
01-10-2018T15:50:10,Bgrmystr2,"tom's ""goddamnit mark"" face is great xD"
01-10-2018T15:50:40,Bgrmystr2,you can see the subtle smirk
01-10-2018T15:50:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I started wondering if anyone had thought of this invention called scissors
01-10-2018T15:53:08,Bgrmystr2,:scissors::ptv-wondering: but what would they do?
01-10-2018T15:54:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Cut open the bags instead of Mark spraying the candy to kingdom come
01-10-2018T15:55:41,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock:
01-10-2018T15:55:47,Bgrmystr2,ingenious
01-10-2018T15:56:04,Bgrmystr2,"but... then we could never look at mark and go ""Really dude?"""
01-10-2018T15:56:13,Bgrmystr2,and that leaves me kind of sad.
01-10-2018T15:56:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"Cause it‚Äôs like at the end, you can barely see the counter"
01-10-2018T15:56:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause of his mess
01-10-2018T16:39:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder if Tom‚Äôs gonna stay in LA a day or hop on home. And also - wonder how Holly has fared
01-10-2018T18:08:25,Ordithus,By now Holly has amassed an army of followers
01-10-2018T18:15:51,CommanderTrace,hellooo:ptv-greetings::grinning:
01-10-2018T18:54:27,SpazztasticKiwi,*Tom returns from distant country* everyone: ‚ÄúSo hows the cat?‚Äù
01-10-2018T19:11:37,Ordithus,Priorities
01-10-2018T19:19:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"Hey if we want to agree on a prank, I‚Äôm all for it"
01-10-2018T19:22:37,unsteddyphoenix,What prank I genuinely want to know about Holly
01-10-2018T19:23:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Same
01-10-2018T19:31:09,Dadrobit,Dunno why he'd want to stay in LA. Most likely he'll just get to LAX and head back home to the kitty asap.
01-10-2018T19:36:09,unsteddyphoenix,s'what IM sayin'
01-10-2018T19:38:17,Dadrobit,"Kinda off topic, but I wish egg nog didn't have such a bad rap."
01-10-2018T19:39:02,Bgrmystr2,does it have a bag rep? I've never heard of such a thing.
01-10-2018T19:39:10,Dadrobit,"Pops came over to record a lesson on my equipment today and saw egg nog in my fridge. ""You're not turning into an alcoholic are you dadrobit?!?!?"""
01-10-2018T19:39:28,Dadrobit,"""Nah, I just really like egg nog, and it was a buck at Wal Mart."""
01-10-2018T19:39:44,unsteddyphoenix,You can get alcohol for $1?
01-10-2018T19:39:55,Bgrmystr2,Don't you have to mix it with alchohol for it to me alchoholic? lol..
01-10-2018T19:40:00,Bgrmystr2,be*
01-10-2018T19:40:35,Dadrobit,"It was ""Southern Comfort"" Egg Nog. So it certainly did imply alcohol. But it was non alcoholic."
01-10-2018T19:40:50,unsteddyphoenix,Aww
01-10-2018T19:41:00,Dadrobit,"Also, yes, you can get alcohol for $1."
01-10-2018T19:41:06,unsteddyphoenix,Oh!
01-10-2018T19:41:25,Bgrmystr2,"I've never seen alchoholic egg nog, ever"
01-10-2018T19:41:26,Bgrmystr2,so..
01-10-2018T19:41:33,Bgrmystr2,"I know it exists, but I've never seen any store sell it."
01-10-2018T19:42:16,Dadrobit,Generally you have to mix it yourself.
01-10-2018T19:42:27,Dadrobit,"It's ""The thing to do"" with egg nog."
01-10-2018T19:42:34,Dadrobit,I don't though.
01-10-2018T19:43:02,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's what I figured.. so I wouldn't suspect someone would have alchoholic egg nog in the carton it came in from the store..
01-10-2018T19:43:06,Bgrmystr2,seems kinda silly
01-10-2018T19:43:30,unsteddyphoenix,So you just drink straight mixer dad?
01-10-2018T19:43:32,unsteddyphoenix,Wild
01-10-2018T19:43:52,Bgrmystr2,"I like eggnog, but I don't drink it alchoholic. Polite pass."
01-10-2018T19:44:16,Dadrobit,*shudders*
01-10-2018T19:47:15,Ordithus,I don't think an alcoholic would choose egg nog.  A bit heavy of a drink.
01-10-2018T19:48:05,Dadrobit,"But.... To be fair, Cr√®me de Violette is pretty tasty by itself in tiny portions."
01-10-2018T19:48:27,Dadrobit,"Wouldn't put it in a glass by itself for a good time, but it's tasty."
01-10-2018T19:54:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Never had eggnog
01-10-2018T20:02:34,unsteddyphoenix,same
01-10-2018T20:02:44,unsteddyphoenix,"I heard only alcoholics drink it, so."
01-10-2018T20:03:10,Ordithus,"It's not my favorite.  It's alright, but kinda weird."
01-10-2018T20:06:34,Bgrmystr2,"the taste seems fine imo, but the taste is really strong, and the consistency is really thick"
01-10-2018T20:08:53,totallynotTrace,wait you can get eggnog at walmart for $1!? its like $2.5 a half galon on sale sometimes where i am
01-10-2018T20:09:17,Bgrmystr2,"weird, seems like picarto's chat server had a hiccup or something"
01-10-2018T20:09:26,Bgrmystr2,and I dunno
01-10-2018T20:09:29,totallynotTrace,although usually is like $4-5
01-10-2018T20:09:38,totallynotTrace,why you say that bgr?
01-10-2018T20:10:00,CrRAR,eggnog? To me it literally tastes like melted vanilla ice cream.
01-10-2018T20:10:16,totallynotTrace,depends on the brand
01-10-2018T20:10:20,Bgrmystr2,cuz on two browsers it disconnected from the chat at the same time and refreshing immediately loaded all the messages but disconnected again
01-10-2018T20:10:30,CrRAR,yeah maybe I'm thinking golden eggnogg
01-10-2018T20:10:44,CrRAR,dunno if I ever had plain now that I think of it
01-10-2018T20:10:44,Bgrmystr2,and my network didn't have any hiccups or whatnot
01-10-2018T20:10:45,totallynotTrace,my browser didnt do that
01-10-2018T20:11:02,Bgrmystr2,you may not be on the same chat server lol
01-10-2018T20:11:08,totallynotTrace,true
01-10-2018T20:11:30,totallynotTrace,cheap eggnog tastes like ice cream

01-10-2018T20:14:31,Ordithus,You can make it yourself
01-10-2018T20:14:35,CrRAR,The holidays are approaching~

01-10-2018T21:46:26,CrRAR,mmmhmm

01-10-2018T22:05:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Calling Tom a hippie?
01-10-2018T22:07:46,Dadrobit,... Yes.
01-10-2018T22:09:08,SpazztasticKiwi,That makes Mark a baby hippie
01-10-2018T22:09:22,SpazztasticKiwi,He‚Äôs growing his hair out
01-10-2018T22:09:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Or is it hippie in training

01-10-2018T22:31:15,Dadrobit,"""Sweet Bud Warrior"" Hell yeah. That's a proper fake hippy name."
01-10-2018T22:32:38,SpazztasticKiwi,You know those game where it‚Äôs ‚Äútake the first letter of your first name..‚Äù
01-10-2018T22:32:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I do those occasionally and they‚Äôre great for stupid names
01-10-2018T22:33:44,Dadrobit,"I unironically love ""Sweet Bud Warrior"". I'm using that for sure the next time I have to create an account for something."
