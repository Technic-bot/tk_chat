30-07-2018T22:55:59,Dadrobit,"""You're speaking to one."""

30-07-2018T22:56:49,totallynotTrace,"Yeah Im only allowed to do that if they have touched me, are threatening, or shoplifting. or extremely inebriated"

30-07-2018T22:57:03,Dadrobit,I did it to a guy for trying to pay in coins.
30-07-2018T22:57:12,EggRollss,The real question is have you shop lifted before?
30-07-2018T22:57:15,Ordithus,Time to sleeeeep :ctwokinds-RainezZz:

30-07-2018T22:57:42,totallynotTrace,lol
30-07-2018T22:57:44,TheGamePlayer,I will never steal
30-07-2018T22:57:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I had a few people pay in change

30-07-2018T22:58:03,Dadrobit,"9 times out of 10, sure whatever."
30-07-2018T22:58:04,CrRAR,That candy bar was probably the sweetest one you ever had~
30-07-2018T22:58:09,CrRAR,...then the guilt set in.
30-07-2018T22:58:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Had to count it. Even if it was in bank rolls
30-07-2018T22:58:44,Dadrobit,"But this dude was making a habit of paying in coins. And on this particulat occasion, it was 10 at night, and I had 4 customers waiting behind him."
30-07-2018T22:58:51,Dadrobit,particular*
30-07-2018T22:58:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom, you ever do retail?"
30-07-2018T22:59:15,Dadrobit,"Told him to either go to the CoinStar machine right beside us, or leave."
30-07-2018T22:59:38,CrRAR,What denomination coins?
30-07-2018T22:59:38,TheGamePlayer,"Wait take that back, when I was five or so there was this small glass dolphin that had no price tags, it was in a zoo gift shop, and the I took it, but first I went up to the front desk said ""hey this thing doesn't have a price tag"" they didn't say anythi"
30-07-2018T22:59:41,totallynotTrace,Ive had some people pay in coins. I told them to go to the service desk
30-07-2018T22:59:46,Dadrobit,He elected to eventually leave after threatening to speak to the store director.
30-07-2018T22:59:46,TheGamePlayer,Anything so I took it
30-07-2018T23:00:05,EggRollss,Bet that was fun
30-07-2018T23:00:22,CrRAR,Did you name the glass dolphin?
30-07-2018T23:00:23,Dadrobit,"A few quarters, but it was a large order, like $30+."
30-07-2018T23:00:31,CrRAR,ah
30-07-2018T23:00:37,TheGamePlayer,No I lost it like five days later
30-07-2018T23:00:46,CrRAR,rip
30-07-2018T23:00:50,CrRAR,little buddy
30-07-2018T23:01:02,TheGamePlayer,Also my coffee kind of evaporated
30-07-2018T23:01:04,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs a gas station that sells blown glass figurines and knights of armor helmets
30-07-2018T23:01:07,Dadrobit,"I actually did have to speak to the store director about it, but he was cool about that situation. He knew the guy was being a pest."
30-07-2018T23:01:18,CrRAR,lol Game
30-07-2018T23:01:19,SpazztasticKiwi,They‚Äôre local and pretty expensive but so gorgeous
30-07-2018T23:01:31,CrRAR,"""Hey! You stole my candy bar!!!"""
30-07-2018T23:01:43,CrRAR,^ I'm quoting Patrick here
30-07-2018T23:02:00,TheGamePlayer,"I filled it up, came back to find like half the cup empty"
30-07-2018T23:02:01,Dadrobit,pls don't evaporate the coffee.
30-07-2018T23:02:14,UrbanRangers,Maybe you droped it
30-07-2018T23:02:19,TheGamePlayer,No
30-07-2018T23:02:28,Dadrobit,"It is for human consumption, not atmosphere consumption."
30-07-2018T23:02:48,TheGamePlayer,Well half of it is now creamer
30-07-2018T23:02:52,TheGamePlayer,And sugar
30-07-2018T23:02:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I liked playing in dirt when I was little
30-07-2018T23:03:04,SpazztasticKiwi,And with bugs
30-07-2018T23:03:26,totallynotTrace,omg yes. I came home covered in mud a few times
30-07-2018T23:03:27,CrRAR,...and... giving hugs?
30-07-2018T23:03:48,SpazztasticKiwi,So one day I ended up taking this mini net that had broke off a garden gnome
30-07-2018T23:04:01,SpazztasticKiwi,From the store
30-07-2018T23:04:03,CrRAR,That's resourceful
30-07-2018T23:04:23,EggRollss,Lol I played PS3 when I was a kid now I play PS4 but did not go outside much
30-07-2018T23:04:32,TheGamePlayer,YES MY GAMES DONE DOWNLOADING
30-07-2018T23:04:37,CrRAR,\o/
30-07-2018T23:04:45,totallynotTrace,when i was a kid ps3 didnt exist.
30-07-2018T23:04:48,TheGamePlayer,After a month
30-07-2018T23:04:48,SpazztasticKiwi,The people at the desk didn‚Äôt care. The thing was broken - so it was destined for claims anyway
30-07-2018T23:04:51,totallynotTrace,PS2 FTW
30-07-2018T23:05:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Me grabbing the net wasn‚Äôt terribly interesting
30-07-2018T23:05:21,TheGamePlayer,I still have a PS1
30-07-2018T23:05:32,TheGamePlayer,It works along with it's games
30-07-2018T23:05:43,Dadrobit,I used to play bike tag as a kid. Resulted in a lot of banged up knees and elbows.
30-07-2018T23:05:55,totallynotTrace,Sky Odysee
30-07-2018T23:05:58,CrRAR,The best teacher is tha streets~
30-07-2018T23:06:15,Dadrobit,Dirt streets at that.
30-07-2018T23:06:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I somehow managed to not break anything until the summer before 6th grade
30-07-2018T23:06:27,Dadrobit,Didn't get our street paved until I was in my teens.
30-07-2018T23:06:35,CrRAR,legit
30-07-2018T23:07:15,Dadrobit,Having pops pull little rocks out of my knees with tweezers was just a regular Saturday night lol.
30-07-2018T23:07:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless you count me chipping a bone in my ankle before that when I twisted it running and landed on the twisted ankle
30-07-2018T23:07:37,Dadrobit,That and jumping cactus. Soooooo much of that.
30-07-2018T23:07:41,totallynotTrace,that sounds like it hurt
30-07-2018T23:07:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Well it didn‚Äôt tickle
30-07-2018T23:08:02,totallynotTrace,I live in connecticut. we dont have cacti
30-07-2018T23:08:06,TheGamePlayer,Ugh haven't broken a bone but I've been my wrist and buckled it
30-07-2018T23:08:06,Dadrobit,"Less than ideal, certainly."
30-07-2018T23:08:20,EggRollss,Were are you that you have cati
30-07-2018T23:08:24,Dadrobit,Arizona
30-07-2018T23:08:29,totallynotTrace,but my neiborhood sure had mud
30-07-2018T23:09:20,totallynotTrace,and grassy hills
30-07-2018T23:09:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"Broke my arm by landing on it, and holding all my weight on it after trying to step over a log and failing"
30-07-2018T23:09:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Cracked the growth plate almost in half
30-07-2018T23:10:13,CrRAR,popping (knee) caps and taking naps; the hallmark of a true gangster.
30-07-2018T23:10:23,SpazztasticKiwi,And now I can‚Äôt bend that arm all the way up anymore
30-07-2018T23:10:40,EggRollss,Dang I did not break anything
30-07-2018T23:10:53,EggRollss,Yet
30-07-2018T23:11:09,totallynotTrace,in first grade I hit my head at recess and had to get staples. I think that was my most severe injury
30-07-2018T23:11:24,totallynotTrace,actually
30-07-2018T23:11:53,totallynotTrace,i got a 4 inch splinter in my foot
30-07-2018T23:13:18,totallynotTrace,"Ironically even though splinter was much less life threatening, it hut a lot more"
30-07-2018T23:17:22,TheGamePlayer,Ugh I have to restart my game threw again.... This is like the sixth time now
30-07-2018T23:17:57,Dadrobit,GG
