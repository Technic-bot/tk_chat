13-03-2018T20:10:59,ItsActuallyKopyKat,I wonder if we'll see those Templar that got turned into (hopefully) hens by Nora's enchantment
13-03-2018T20:11:14,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Now that we're in Trace's backyard
13-03-2018T20:11:20,JaydenMozingo,It hurts my eyes and brain thinking about what would happen if I touched a flare on the gate
13-03-2018T20:11:33,Ordithus,Hello! :ctwokinds-floAAA:
13-03-2018T20:11:37,PalmettoPathfinder1,"True.  While I was expecting something more Stargate like I guess it was still unique and interesting.  Still, when you're dealing with magic, one using expects a dash of extravagance and flashiness"
13-03-2018T20:11:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Ord
13-03-2018T20:11:39,Sammit,Hi Ord

13-03-2018T20:12:28,PalmettoPathfinder1,Although that depends on the flashiness of the spell being cast.
13-03-2018T20:12:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Sythe is all ""Damn rabbit getting all the attention."""
13-03-2018T20:12:38,CanisRufusUK,"Depends on the Magic, Discworld is all about flash and show, Tolkien magic though is usualy very subtle"
13-03-2018T20:12:47,PalmettoPathfinder1,"True Canis, true."
13-03-2018T20:13:07,Bgrmystr2,haha nat's trying to hold in laughter xD

13-03-2018T20:15:57,JaydenMozingo,I wonder if zen has the same sleeping condition as Natani: Biting things in there sleep
13-03-2018T20:16:21,BadFoMo,Maybe she got it from Zen?
13-03-2018T20:16:23,JaydenMozingo,"Keith buddy, keep your ears away just to be safe"
13-03-2018T20:16:24,Ordithus,"Zen licks, apparently."

13-03-2018T20:20:18,MviluUatusun,"Oh, okay, Marv.  I know how that goes."
13-03-2018T20:20:30,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, we aren't sure how powerful her ability is though."

13-03-2018T20:40:46,qwe304,"it wouldnt be just a linp, there would be lots of tissue daage, and his muscles and tendons need to heal (without magic) would take a few months to heal"
13-03-2018T20:40:52,MuonNeutrino,"@HeresyArtStream @Ordithus according to tom in a previous stream, magic actually isn't good at treating infections because people in the TK world don't actually know the germ theory of medicine and so don't know what causes them"

13-03-2018T21:30:25,Kynum,agreed. Detail is awesome.
13-03-2018T21:30:58,JaydenMozingo,My point though. Two time a weeks would kill the guy
13-03-2018T21:31:08,ZephyrTWolffox,also not good to push yourself too hard
13-03-2018T21:31:11,unsteddyphoenix,Which is why he's put less detail to compensaite
13-03-2018T21:31:15,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Plus that would get in the way of the sketch streams
13-03-2018T21:31:18,unsteddyphoenix,Hence the question
13-03-2018T21:31:21,BluePhantom90,"I would say this Tom. I read a lot of comic's with less details, even with no color. I would say it would be fun if you did s small side comic just in black, gray and white like the sketches you do"
13-03-2018T21:31:21,JaydenMozingo,Yeah
13-03-2018T21:31:40,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"That's a cool idea, Blue"

13-03-2018T23:01:38,HeresyArtStream,Chicken pox is okay...
13-03-2018T23:01:42,Bgrmystr2,lol dadro xD

13-03-2018T23:02:06,Zapheth,yeah
13-03-2018T23:02:15,HeresyArtStream,I think Rogue One would have been a lot better without the reshoots.

13-03-2018T23:02:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-FloDance:
13-03-2018T23:02:27,HeresyArtStream,Darth Vader did not belong in Rogue One. It kind of ruins his reveal in Episode IV.
13-03-2018T23:02:28,Zapheth,the scene at the end was unnecessary
13-03-2018T23:02:29,CrimsonHelsing,Wubwubwubboom-boom
13-03-2018T23:02:34,Zapheth,I agree Heresy
13-03-2018T23:02:46,HeresyArtStream,Darth Vader does not go chopping through a crowd of helpless Rebel soldiers. He has an army to do that for him.
13-03-2018T23:02:46,Vatruvius,"Being entirely honest though, Gandalf would wreck Dumbledore a new one. ""You.....call that......magic!"""
13-03-2018T23:02:50,Zapheth,plus the complete attitude shift
13-03-2018T23:02:51,MuonNeutrino,i like how the estate side of this fancy important gate is one of those flimsy garden archway things XD
13-03-2018T23:03:11,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
13-03-2018T23:03:22,HeresyArtStream,Gandalf has a staff. Dumbledor has a twig. Nuff said.
13-03-2018T23:03:28,unsteddyphoenix,Magically reinforced trust
13-03-2018T23:03:29,MuonNeutrino,gandalf is an incarnate angel. dumbledore is a man &gt;.&gt;
13-03-2018T23:03:31,Ordithus,"There is your fancy portal border, folks."

13-03-2018T23:03:58,HeresyArtStream,lol
13-03-2018T23:04:00,MuonNeutrino,haha
13-03-2018T23:04:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
13-03-2018T23:04:00,unsteddyphoenix,Angle.
13-03-2018T23:04:04,Twokinds,That's the point. It's disguised as an ordinary... trellis? I don't know what these things are called
13-03-2018T23:04:05,Vatruvius,"Heresy, that was one of the coolest scenes ever. Darth Vader is this super strong sith who takes on entire armies alone. The originals never really acknowledged that but Rogue One did."
13-03-2018T23:04:19,Zapheth,but it didn't make sense
13-03-2018T23:04:28,Ordithus,It doesn't need to
13-03-2018T23:04:29,Zapheth,"in a new hope, he's rather calm and collected"
13-03-2018T23:04:29,MuonNeutrino,@Twokinds it does make sense if you want it to go unnoticed. its just kinda funny is all
13-03-2018T23:04:34,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs a trellis
13-03-2018T23:04:39,unsteddyphoenix,Ironic
13-03-2018T23:04:41,Zapheth,when he walks in he's not killing everything
13-03-2018T23:04:45,Kyslyrn,Yeah its a trellis
13-03-2018T23:05:22,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Trellis, or arbor"
13-03-2018T23:05:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,pretty wood thing
13-03-2018T23:05:44,unsteddyphoenix,Also can be called a Calliarch
13-03-2018T23:05:44,Dadrobit,I fire an arrow at the trellis.
13-03-2018T23:05:49,HeresyArtStream,Gandalf survived falling into a bottomless pit while battling an ancient evil being so powerful not even Sauron had control over it.
13-03-2018T23:06:03,MuonNeutrino,@Dadrobit nothing happens. it's a trellis!
13-03-2018T23:06:05,HeresyArtStream,Dumbledor couldn't survive an entire book seires. :V
13-03-2018T23:06:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,the Balrog was a foot soldier dude
13-03-2018T23:06:09,SpazztasticKiwi,They can be shaped into arches and have vine-growing plants trained to climb them
13-03-2018T23:06:09,Vatruvius,"Yeah, but if you think about it the very first Star Wars did not have all this lore behind it like it does now. So Darth Vader turned from the strong general/sith into an absolute badass that should not be messed with."
13-03-2018T23:06:13,Kynum,you must face the trellis alone
13-03-2018T23:06:15,unsteddyphoenix,In Europe they refer them them as pimbuenos
13-03-2018T23:06:32,NightMeaty22,Ok it is time for me to get some sleep cya and thanks for the stream tom
13-03-2018T23:06:33,Dadrobit,\o/ Someone gets my obscure-ish reference
13-03-2018T23:06:35,MuonNeutrino,^_^

13-03-2018T23:06:43,MuonNeutrino,"""but that was a +3 arrow!"""
13-03-2018T23:06:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Luck
13-03-2018T23:06:49,Vatruvius,Rogue One simply acknowledged his character growth.
13-03-2018T23:07:32,ComicLuke,"i now wake up and i dont mind, that stream yet going"
13-03-2018T23:07:36,HeresyArtStream,Darth Vader in Rogue One was fanservice. It's as shameless as if they had Leia in the metal bikini for no reason.
13-03-2018T23:07:38,NightMeaty22,Good night all and have a nice day
13-03-2018T23:07:39,Sammit,Hi Luke
13-03-2018T23:07:39,unsteddyphoenix,It had a likable MC
13-03-2018T23:07:43,unsteddyphoenix,Low standards nowadays
13-03-2018T23:07:45,Sammit,Bye Meaty
13-03-2018T23:07:50,Bgrmystr2,@MuonNeutrino It's too late. You have angered the trellis. It eats you.
13-03-2018T23:07:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,see ya meat
13-03-2018T23:08:00,MuonNeutrino,hehe
13-03-2018T23:08:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,like a tremor
13-03-2018T23:08:06,Dadrobit,So ends the tale of the Dread Trellis
13-03-2018T23:08:06,MuonNeutrino,someone else gets the reference ^^
13-03-2018T23:08:07,HeresyArtStream,Gareth Edward didn't even direct the Darth Vader scenes because he didn't want them in the movie.
13-03-2018T23:08:11,unsteddyphoenix,I cast magic missle at the Trellis?
13-03-2018T23:08:19,HeresyArtStream,He did agree to play a Rebel soldier getting killed by vader as a cameo though.
13-03-2018T23:08:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Gareth Edward make another Godzilla pls
13-03-2018T23:08:34,Bgrmystr2,"Sage told me, and it became one of my favorite stories ever, Muon xD"
13-03-2018T23:08:37,HeresyArtStream,"That was his way of saying ""Darth vader killed me and I didn't get to make the movie the way I wanted."""
13-03-2018T23:08:41,MuonNeutrino,"it's a good one, for sure"
13-03-2018T23:08:44,ComicLuke,guys? some one drawing comic like Tom?

13-03-2018T23:11:30,Dadrobit,o/ Une

13-03-2018T23:13:04,Dadrobit,Is it a drink? Not familiar w/ that unless you're talking about the bill of the drink which is called a tab
13-03-2018T23:13:21,unsteddyphoenix,its a drink
13-03-2018T23:13:23,Bgrmystr2,the effects tho xD

13-03-2018T23:14:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Wait till raine gives zen his bill for all the drugs she shoved into him
13-03-2018T23:14:11,Bgrmystr2,Never drank it myself
13-03-2018T23:14:14,Bgrmystr2,no idea what it's like
13-03-2018T23:14:17,Bgrmystr2,I just know it's a drink
13-03-2018T23:14:22,unsteddyphoenix,My sources tell me it
13-03-2018T23:14:22,BadFoMo,I think I remember seeing it as a joke in Harve Birdman: Aterny a Law once.
13-03-2018T23:14:26,unsteddyphoenix,is gross
13-03-2018T23:14:30,Dadrobit,"Huh, it's a Coca Cola property"

13-03-2018T23:15:34,unsteddyphoenix,Oh whaaaat. I had no idea.
13-03-2018T23:15:53,unsteddyphoenix,Is it still avaliable?
13-03-2018T23:15:54,ComicLuke,argh! someone know? hou on stream in streamlabs!?
13-03-2018T23:16:02,Vatruvius,Okay...but my point was in this moment Keith is not having fun while everyone else would be getting a good laugh.
13-03-2018T23:16:14,qwe304,im likin this new music
13-03-2018T23:16:22,Dadrobit,That's how jokes work. Someone or something has to be hurt

13-03-2018T23:17:56,qwe304,wouldnt the difference in air pressure due to the altitude difference between the ends of the portal cause a noticable wind current through the porwal (nevermind the laws of thermodynamics)
13-03-2018T23:18:22,Bgrmystr2,it's probably not THAT different
13-03-2018T23:18:23,ComicLuke,but i still sad

13-03-2018T23:18:38,MuonNeutrino,"most likely, yes, but it depends how high the estate is in the foothills"
13-03-2018T23:18:39,Vatruvius,"Dang it, wrong again."
13-03-2018T23:18:41,Bgrmystr2,"but yeah, you can see the leaves through the gate"

13-03-2018T23:20:39,MuonNeutrino,@Ordithus i have a feeling in that case that the energy is going to come out of the energy use of the portal
13-03-2018T23:20:40,Ordithus,Portals are best when you don't think too much about them.
13-03-2018T23:20:41,Dadrobit,Because the plot demands no one in the comic think like that

13-03-2018T23:22:39,ComicLuke,yup
13-03-2018T23:22:43,Unenlagia,I'm counting them as magical mounts
13-03-2018T23:22:56,Unenlagia,So no
13-03-2018T23:23:03,Dadrobit,Especially since they're in Saddlebags of Holding
13-03-2018T23:23:21,Dadrobit,I'd count it
13-03-2018T23:23:31,Unenlagia,Okay... three forms of magical teleportation. Is that acceptable?
13-03-2018T23:23:45,Bgrmystr2,"saddlebags were magic, but.. they were not transported magically"
13-03-2018T23:23:47,unsteddyphoenix,MAYBE
13-03-2018T23:23:50,Bgrmystr2,they still had to be physically flown there
13-03-2018T23:24:03,unsteddyphoenix,By something magical
13-03-2018T23:24:04,Unenlagia,Two if the Rift walls and the gate here function on the same principle.
13-03-2018T23:24:05,Dadrobit,But dragons are beings of magic
13-03-2018T23:24:06,Sammit,is possible to Nibbly to travel via Natanis' bandages?
13-03-2018T23:24:19,Bgrmystr2,the magic is not what made the transportation
13-03-2018T23:24:19,Combak,Probably?
