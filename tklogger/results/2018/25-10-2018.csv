25-10-2018T18:22:03,Ordithus,"Yeah.  I think Tom takes more time with the ""sketches"" when not doing them all in one stream."
25-10-2018T18:26:17,unsteddyphoenix,Thats probably true. We're just used to his rushed pace
25-10-2018T18:26:22,CommanderTrace,can you only subscribe with a credit card?
25-10-2018T18:26:56,Bgrmystr2,there's several ways to subscribe. To both patreon and picarto

25-10-2018T18:31:00,Ordithus,stripe?
25-10-2018T18:31:23,CommanderTrace,if paypal goes that would be nice

25-10-2018T19:36:03,SageSaga,Looks like Monster Squad will be playable for the stream tonight
25-10-2018T19:36:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,YES!!!! \o/

25-10-2018T19:36:27,FoxxTrotter,:0)
25-10-2018T19:36:28,Bgrmystr2,:o
25-10-2018T19:37:07,SageSaga,the video is very wide screen though so its gonna be a little awkward drawing around it XD
25-10-2018T19:37:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
25-10-2018T19:39:18,Mihari,Quick sage register another account called SageMovie and add it your multistream and have it playing the movie XD
25-10-2018T19:39:39,Bgrmystr2,lol.. the acct could be banned
25-10-2018T19:39:44,Mihari,Probably
25-10-2018T19:39:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nihari with the pro strats
25-10-2018T19:40:01,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: there's two of them?!
25-10-2018T19:41:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,they are multiplying
25-10-2018T19:41:39,Bgrmystr2,noo
25-10-2018T19:42:11,Ordithus,We are doomed
25-10-2018T19:42:38,SageSaga,unfortunately Once it is done theres only 2 episodes left of Ghost Hunt to watch-
25-10-2018T19:42:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,;-;
25-10-2018T19:43:02,SageSaga,so i guess after those we will be returning to standard music- unless i can find something else to play-
25-10-2018T19:43:09,Bgrmystr2,I figured you'd open with ghost hunt and then show the movie after
25-10-2018T19:43:17,SageSaga,or if i can find a spooky sound track to play
25-10-2018T19:43:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"well Halloween is the Wednesday, so it could be prefect timing"
25-10-2018T19:43:28,SageSaga,nah more people are here earlier
25-10-2018T19:43:48,SageSaga,i rather have em able to see the movie than the anime
25-10-2018T19:43:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,let me do some spook music searching
25-10-2018T19:44:31,SageSaga,i dont use ad block on Youtube and i dont have youtube red or anything to get rid of ads on music playlists on the tubes
25-10-2018T19:44:49,MarvTheHugPharaoh,oofy
25-10-2018T19:45:14,CommanderTrace,use opera
25-10-2018T19:45:26,SageSaga,also i lost 300 dollars on a car repair and lost like 80-120 dollars in patreon money this month- so i cant just buy it
25-10-2018T19:45:34,CommanderTrace,100% addblock
25-10-2018T19:45:42,Ordithus,ouch Sage
25-10-2018T19:46:00,SageSaga,i have adblock- i dont use it for youtube
25-10-2018T19:46:30,CommanderTrace,why?
25-10-2018T19:46:43,SageSaga,to support creators i like
25-10-2018T19:47:39,SageSaga,if you dont get ads when you watch videos- they dont get ad revenue simple concept
25-10-2018T19:47:47,CommanderTrace,on my mobile phone i don't have one but on my pc already so i support them a bit xD
25-10-2018T19:48:24,Ordithus,I'll unblock YT after the election... eugh
25-10-2018T19:48:43,SageSaga,i also like seeing what kinda ads im being targeted with
25-10-2018T19:49:01,CommanderTrace,:joy:
25-10-2018T19:49:04,Ordithus,I don't know of any ads for cat girls...
25-10-2018T19:49:12,SageSaga,gives me a good idea how hard the algorithm tries
25-10-2018T19:49:49,SageSaga,like i googled to make sure i spelled something right - since Clip doesnt have spell check- and i started getting ads for that thing i searched just to make sure i spelled it right
25-10-2018T19:51:20,Combak,Hey all.

25-10-2018T21:05:07,Vatruvius,lol

25-10-2018T21:05:25,MrEase,there needs to be more anthro-y Twokinds dragons

25-10-2018T21:05:47,Corinthian,I second Ease's notion.
25-10-2018T21:05:54,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Death by snu snu is worth it
25-10-2018T21:05:55,CrRAR,isn't that what the adrakists are for?
25-10-2018T21:05:57,Dadrobit,So that Basitin is close to Adelaide size.
25-10-2018T21:06:11,Vatruvius,^CrRAR
25-10-2018T21:06:16,ZRO4825,I thought Ade was like 7 or 8 feet tall?
25-10-2018T21:06:24,ItsActuallyKopyKat,she is
25-10-2018T21:06:24,Mippy,I mean... it’s not that far out of the realm of possibility that there is another 7 foot Basitin lady out there
25-10-2018T21:06:33,Ordithus,"7'2"""
25-10-2018T21:06:43,unsteddyphoenix,It's...a stretch.

25-10-2018T21:06:56,unsteddyphoenix,ANd Renis shrunk for composition purposes
25-10-2018T21:06:57,Mippy,Definitely rare...but not impossible
25-10-2018T21:07:01,Dadrobit,"Yeah, and this Basitin is standing slightly above Reni's shoulders, whereas Kei barely makes it."
25-10-2018T21:07:24,ZRO4825,There is only one way to make sure.
25-10-2018T21:07:32,ZRO4825,Ade and this Basitin lady need to be in the same room.
25-10-2018T21:07:50,Vatruvius,"How about, since Reni can see into Eric's mind, is actively making him see her smaller than she is."
25-10-2018T21:07:55,ZRO4825,Wait...what if Adelaide is actually a Western Basitin in disguise? o.O
25-10-2018T21:07:57,Dadrobit,Only if they're making a Reni sandwich.
25-10-2018T21:07:58,Mihari,"Or you could just ya know, remember that all these aren't canonical."
25-10-2018T21:08:02,Bgrmystr2,Do I spy another height comparison chart suggestion in the making? :u
25-10-2018T21:08:09,CrRAR,"yeahh... in light of recent discussion we may need a ""Reni as royal Basitin steed"" suggestion at some point."
25-10-2018T21:08:18,Dadrobit,Everything is canonical Mihari. Everything.
25-10-2018T21:08:20,ZRO4825,"Shhhh, shush Mihari, we're having fun plotting our nonsensical non-canon craziness! :P"
25-10-2018T21:08:21,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds very badass

25-10-2018T21:15:51,unsteddyphoenix,Is it old? Hm I dont remember it
25-10-2018T21:15:57,Mippy,Dad lives in a hot place
25-10-2018T21:15:59,Corinthian,"Oh wow, that's an old piece."
25-10-2018T21:16:01,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"before your time, teddy"
25-10-2018T21:16:04,Bgrmystr2,ooo I like that
25-10-2018T21:16:12,Nekonny,"Question! back when reni was looking into traces memories of him and nora together, and the nora memory pointed out that it was rude to spy on them"
25-10-2018T21:16:20,Bgrmystr2,that must be fairly old since Phoenix's been around for a long time
25-10-2018T21:16:20,Mippy,Still cute
25-10-2018T21:16:24,thestooge,Gonna have the Kimono be a little lower on her?
25-10-2018T21:16:26,Nekonny,"when that part of the comic happened, did nora actually say that?"
25-10-2018T21:16:28,unsteddyphoenix,"Possible, I guess."
25-10-2018T21:16:35,CommanderTrace,no
25-10-2018T21:16:36,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"I think so, Nekonny"
25-10-2018T21:16:42,ItsActuallyKopyKat,the Nora in Trace's head said that
25-10-2018T21:16:42,CommanderTrace,she doesnt
25-10-2018T21:16:47,Ordithus,Or did she :ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:
25-10-2018T21:16:48,Twokinds,XD
25-10-2018T21:16:56,Vatruvius,She said is was rude to prod Nekonny
25-10-2018T21:16:57,MrEase,"I don't think I remember that, but I think its just Nora is that OP"
25-10-2018T21:16:57,Twokinds,The memory of a Nora becomes itself a Nora
25-10-2018T21:17:00,ItsActuallyKopyKat,yes
25-10-2018T21:17:01,Nekonny,lol
25-10-2018T21:17:02,ShadowSoap,"I mean, it's Nora. She does basically whatever the hell she wants"
25-10-2018T21:17:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
25-10-2018T21:17:07,Bgrmystr2,yes Ron Nora actually said that. She said it was rude to pry
25-10-2018T21:17:07,unsteddyphoenix,Thats how powerful Nora is
25-10-2018T21:17:12,Dadrobit,Recursive Nora. Nora's all the way down.
25-10-2018T21:17:20,ItsActuallyKopyKat,yes
25-10-2018T21:17:24,Tharkis,Tom said that any representation of nora can become a nora (like the plush nora doll) so makes sense =D
25-10-2018T21:17:30,Nekonny,but she didn't say that when the event actually took place
25-10-2018T21:17:34,Nekonny,during the comic
25-10-2018T21:17:34,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Kopybot.exe has stopped working @unsteddyphoenix
25-10-2018T21:17:36,unsteddyphoenix,It was probably some sort of anti-mind read sass-spell that triggered when Reni looked?
25-10-2018T21:17:38,Bgrmystr2,Endless Nora. She is infinite. She is all.
25-10-2018T21:17:42,unsteddyphoenix,Ah fuck not again
25-10-2018T21:17:45,Twokinds,"I mean, it was partially just a gag, but I don't really want to say anything difinitive one way or another. I guess it could be interpretted as either a telepathic communication, or some sort of mental trap."
25-10-2018T21:17:53,Nekonny,hahah sure
25-10-2018T21:18:05,Ordithus,Some things should be ambiguous
25-10-2018T21:18:08,unsteddyphoenix,I'd bet on trap
25-10-2018T21:18:14,Nekonny,I just thought for a moment it could have been a throwback
25-10-2018T21:18:20,ShadowSoap,"If everything was well defined, what would we have to talk about?"
25-10-2018T21:18:25,Nekonny,but I never got arund to going back to look
25-10-2018T21:18:42,ZRO4825,"If everything were well defined, we'd talk about how we wish not everything were so well-defined."
25-10-2018T21:18:42,Ordithus,The page the scene references does not have that
25-10-2018T21:18:53,Bgrmystr2,"would we, zro? :o"
25-10-2018T21:19:01,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"that's pretty meta, Zro"
25-10-2018T21:19:03,CommanderTrace,I can't go on the twokinds side is that the same with you guys?
25-10-2018T21:19:05,Ordithus,"But it COULD have been ""off-page"" as it were"
25-10-2018T21:19:06,ShadowSoap,Force ourselves into an endless loop
25-10-2018T21:19:07,ItsActuallyKopyKat,big fan
25-10-2018T21:19:21,Ordithus,"Thanks for the movie, Sage!"

25-10-2018T21:20:00,Mihari,There are a bunch of old sketches I'd love for Tom to revist XD
25-10-2018T21:20:01,Twokinds,"I actually considered going back and editing an old page temporarily, just to see if anyone went looking"
25-10-2018T21:20:10,Ordithus,haha
25-10-2018T21:20:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
25-10-2018T21:20:20,unsteddyphoenix,"Or maybe he did, and noone noticed..."
25-10-2018T21:20:23,Twokinds,But it wouldn't really fit anywhere. The convo doesn't exactly line up.
25-10-2018T21:20:23,Vatruvius,Is your site down Tom? I can't reach it.
25-10-2018T21:20:26,Dadrobit,"Nah, people will always find petty deatail shit to argue about even when everything is super well defined. Source: Erfworld."
25-10-2018T21:20:37,ItsActuallyKopyKat,I can reach it just fine @Vatruvius

25-10-2018T21:21:23,Mihari,"Paprika is nothing but a CB edit conspiracy, *nods*"
25-10-2018T21:21:28,Tharkis,!
25-10-2018T21:21:34,Dadrobit,"Ah, speaking of. Did you ever get around to re-establishing that Alaric tail wag, Tom?"
25-10-2018T21:21:39,Nekonny,more like a ToL edit fact
25-10-2018T21:21:45,SageSaga,next up is the last episodes of Ghost Hunt
25-10-2018T21:21:47,Tharkis,"Ron Tom and Sage are all just trolling their readers, constantly !"
25-10-2018T21:21:49,ZoieFalcona,Oh really?!
25-10-2018T21:22:03,Mihari,No it's a Tol Retcon.

25-10-2018T21:22:31,Nekonny,"no wait, thats tom"

25-10-2018T21:22:49,Nekonny,Didn't picollo blow up the moon once?
25-10-2018T21:22:58,unsteddyphoenix,Is it on DA?
25-10-2018T21:23:03,MrEase,so did master Roshi
25-10-2018T21:23:03,Twokinds,It feels like yesterday.
25-10-2018T21:23:12,Mippy,"Yes, Nekonny"
25-10-2018T21:23:13,Twokinds,But then I remember that was in 2009. Almost a decade ago.
25-10-2018T21:23:13,Tharkis,i thought that was vegeeta
25-10-2018T21:23:17,ShadowSoap,Tom is having a Nostalgia Trip
25-10-2018T21:23:21,CrRAR,Nora in your brains messing with memories
25-10-2018T21:23:27,MrEase,in the original Dragon ball Master Roshi also blew up the moon
25-10-2018T21:23:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,THOR!!!
25-10-2018T21:23:29,Tharkis,"but man, i cant keep straight which Dragonball is which these days"
25-10-2018T21:23:29,ZoieFalcona,*yawnstretches*  I thought it was Koro-sensei that nearly blew up the moon in its entirety
25-10-2018T21:23:35,CrRAR,Let's just say she altered the memory... PRAY she doesn't alter it any further.
25-10-2018T21:23:51,Ordithus,Slow Kaylin belly reveal

25-10-2018T21:40:59,ShadowSoap,It's good; This mighty comic will live on through the generations
25-10-2018T21:41:03,CommanderTrace,but I've only known the comic for about 7-8 months
25-10-2018T21:41:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,No I'm just a mean old man
25-10-2018T21:41:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,now even

25-10-2018T21:41:47,CommanderTrace,I wish I'd known him sooner
25-10-2018T21:41:52,totallynotTrace,@Randox lol I finished that stuff a few years ago now i have no legal restrictions left. ie not technically supposed to use the radio for something like 6 months and theres a 2 year restriction on something i forget

25-10-2018T21:42:22,ShadowSoap,I've only been following the comic since mid-February

25-10-2018T21:43:48,CommanderTrace,i became interested in Tom and the comic through a Kat youtube video
25-10-2018T21:44:09,ShadowSoap,"Do you happen to have a towel, Mippy?"
25-10-2018T21:44:31,Mippy,A wet one in the corner of my roo
25-10-2018T21:44:35,Mippy,m
25-10-2018T21:44:59,Bgrmystr2,I'm not going to ask why.
25-10-2018T21:45:13,ShadowSoap,"Ah, good, a traveler who knows where their towel is."
25-10-2018T21:45:14,Randox,"I really wanted to read two kinds for a while in 2016, but I was busy, then I finally after a while of seeing lots of cute comics and pic of TK, I read all of it in 3 days"
25-10-2018T21:45:31,totallynotTrace,i stumbled uppon tom first via Marks shoutout years ago but i didnt really look him up. then a few months ago i stumbled across some reposts on ifunny with toms watermark at the bottom so i looked up the comic and got hooked
25-10-2018T21:45:32,AFallingTree,i found this comic through a fan-made comic
25-10-2018T21:46:02,ShadowSoap,I found this when someone posted it on iFunny :ptv-uneasy:
25-10-2018T21:46:08,Randox,It’s so cute and loveable and I love the artstyle and how everyone is cute and nice and fits together
25-10-2018T21:46:16,Randox,It’s also funny x3
25-10-2018T21:46:39,Twokinds,Thanks for reading :)
25-10-2018T21:46:41,Eternity1,"I was searching online, I forget what it was but I got hooked"
25-10-2018T21:46:44,Vatruvius,Don't forget about the sappy romance! XD
25-10-2018T21:46:55,CommanderTrace,I needed 2 nights and one day  I was totally tired in school

25-10-2018T21:47:40,thestooge,Always nice to hear people's stories of finding the comic!
25-10-2018T21:47:42,totallynotTrace,took me a week
25-10-2018T21:47:44,Mippy,.....Sadly I leaned about Twokinds by reading that horrible artical on the Badwebcomics Wiki. Good thing I have a healthy dose of skepticisum and went to take a look for myself
25-10-2018T21:47:56,ShadowSoap,It has caused me to search the internet for more webcomics to fill the gaps between updates
25-10-2018T21:47:58,Mihari,"Lets see, I found it through IRC (wow I just aged myself!)"
25-10-2018T21:48:00,Ordithus,"I don't really remember how I first discovered TK, but I learned of Sage and Ron's works via TK"
25-10-2018T21:48:09,Eternity1,3 days
25-10-2018T21:48:18,Eternity1,I read it in three days

25-10-2018T21:48:30,ZRO4825,I've been reading them all for so long I don't remember when I found them. :joy:
25-10-2018T21:48:39,CommanderTrace,:joy:
25-10-2018T21:48:50,unsteddyphoenix,"I literally just googled ""best webcomic"" and found it :sunglasses:"
25-10-2018T21:48:57,Vatruvius,I feel like I scraped the skin of my knuckle but didn't.
25-10-2018T21:48:59,Ordithus,I do know I came on board shortly after the April Fools' Day fiasco
25-10-2018T21:49:01,Vatruvius,****

25-10-2018T21:51:21,Combak,Same.
25-10-2018T21:51:25,Tharkis,what i do is i let them pile up for a bit and then binge 6 months of a comic in a sitting =P
25-10-2018T21:51:28,Eternity1,im gonna look for more webcomics now...
25-10-2018T21:51:35,Bgrmystr2,hmm. New one looks good. I feel that it's missing the charm of the original. Dunno how though..
25-10-2018T21:51:38,ShadowSoap,I feel like I could take on a few more before reaching a healthy point
25-10-2018T21:51:43,Twokinds,I used to read dozens of webcomics

25-10-2018T21:52:48,Vatruvius,The charm you are speaking of Bgr is the old art style.
25-10-2018T21:52:50,CrRAR,that's one quallllity rustic porch.
25-10-2018T21:52:55,CrRAR,very realistic

25-10-2018T23:08:09,SpazztasticKiwi,The irony with the eyelashes thing is there’s lots of girls that have to apply eyelashes like the ones used for the “feminine look” in drawings

25-10-2018T23:17:58,Ordithus,I expect artists wouldn't use a blue-light blocker while arting

25-10-2018T23:19:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Why does he wear glasses

25-10-2018T23:20:09,Mippy,I use to get eye strain....but that's because I needed perscription glasses. I was blind
25-10-2018T23:20:19,Ordithus,Supposely turning down the blue helps with sleep
25-10-2018T23:20:35,CrRAR,yeahhhh
25-10-2018T23:20:38,Twokinds,"Uh, I don't see how that's unbelievable."
25-10-2018T23:20:45,CrRAR,but who needs THAT
25-10-2018T23:21:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Then you’re blinder than I thought tom
25-10-2018T23:21:05,Mippy,:ctwokinds-natanisleep:
25-10-2018T23:21:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Night night mippy
25-10-2018T23:21:17,SageSaga,i need new glasses- ive had these for like 16 years or something
25-10-2018T23:21:18,Twokinds,I don't get eye strain from screens.
25-10-2018T23:21:21,Ordithus,Night Mippy
25-10-2018T23:21:22,Vatruvius,That is what the doctors say. I cannot speak on its effect on sleep but what I can say is that since I got these glasses I went from getting up to drink water and use the bathroom once a night to never waking up until morning.
25-10-2018T23:21:31,Ordithus,"The same pair, Sage?"
25-10-2018T23:21:34,SageSaga,yep
25-10-2018T23:21:36,Ordithus,Wow
25-10-2018T23:21:38,Nekonny,ust got new glasses this month
25-10-2018T23:21:43,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah, this blue light thing sounds like some scam to me :u"
25-10-2018T23:21:47,Ordithus,I need new glasses myself
25-10-2018T23:21:50,unsteddyphoenix,I cant even think of anyone I know who DOES get eye strain :thinking:
25-10-2018T23:21:51,Nekonny,been using the same pair for something like 8 years
25-10-2018T23:21:57,Twokinds,"In fact, I don't think people really get eye strain from screens."
25-10-2018T23:21:58,Ordithus,Hi unsteddy
25-10-2018T23:22:06,unsteddyphoenix,Hey Ord
25-10-2018T23:22:08,thestooge,that's good
25-10-2018T23:22:12,unsteddyphoenix,"Anyway yeah, I dont know ANYONE"
25-10-2018T23:22:15,Ordithus,Hence why I need new glasses
25-10-2018T23:22:19,CrRAR,haha
25-10-2018T23:22:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Mom voice “it’s those darn phones!”
25-10-2018T23:22:25,SageSaga,for my birthday next month my family is gonna pay for me to get my eyes examined so i can then buy some glasses
25-10-2018T23:22:30,Ordithus,"Also, :ctwokinds-LauraCry:"
25-10-2018T23:22:32,CrRAR,:DDD
25-10-2018T23:22:32,Mippy,"Yup, definatly calling it a night. Eyes are watering."
25-10-2018T23:22:37,Mihari,"You could get eye strain from those old CRT monitors, but modern ones, eh, not so much."
25-10-2018T23:22:37,unsteddyphoenix,Haha
25-10-2018T23:22:39,Combak,Ha.\
25-10-2018T23:22:39,PrincessAkynu,eye strain was a thing onlt CRT screens had
25-10-2018T23:22:39,unsteddyphoenix,Why dont you get blue glasses?
25-10-2018T23:22:43,RimaDraws,ni mippy
25-10-2018T23:22:43,CrRAR,bye mip!
25-10-2018T23:22:44,Mippy,Good Night
25-10-2018T23:22:51,unsteddyphoenix,gnight mip
25-10-2018T23:22:57,Bgrmystr2,lolo
25-10-2018T23:22:57,Issus,"60Hz CRTs were murder on me, could see the flicker easily."
25-10-2018T23:23:03,Bgrmystr2,yeah CRTs destroy eyes
25-10-2018T23:23:03,unsteddyphoenix,Oooh you could get some gunners Ord!
25-10-2018T23:23:04,Issus,Was a godsend to finally get one that was 75Hz.
25-10-2018T23:23:06,Ordithus,It's the prescription being off by now
25-10-2018T23:23:07,Bgrmystr2,I'm a good example.
25-10-2018T23:23:09,SageSaga,now most eye strain from computers is simply because you blink less while focusing on something
25-10-2018T23:23:15,Mihari,The only way you'd get eye strain from a modern monitor is if you're sitting in the dark and close to it and it's a high brightness screen XD
25-10-2018T23:23:15,Issus,LCDs though don't flicker like that so much easier.
25-10-2018T23:23:17,unsteddyphoenix,You'll be the coolest dude!
25-10-2018T23:23:34,Rooth,"I'm loving this scene, TwoKinds :)"
25-10-2018T23:24:09,CrRAR,it is quite lovely
25-10-2018T23:24:17,Rooth,"Good suggestion, @MrEase"
25-10-2018T23:24:22,unsteddyphoenix,Reni is such a goddamn cutie
25-10-2018T23:24:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,^
25-10-2018T23:24:30,unsteddyphoenix,No dragon should be this cute
25-10-2018T23:24:32,unsteddyphoenix,There should be a law
25-10-2018T23:24:37,Ordithus,ikr
25-10-2018T23:24:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Reni is best dragon
25-10-2018T23:24:49,Vatruvius,"You might have something there @Mihari, I think that might have been my problem and, since my new desk, I have been sitting back farther but I do not know."
25-10-2018T23:24:50,CrRAR,well she makes up for it with her intense side.
25-10-2018T23:24:52,Mihari,I should delte that statement
25-10-2018T23:24:52,Ordithus,Dragons are supposed to be scary
25-10-2018T23:24:56,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-renirawr:
25-10-2018T23:25:04,CrRAR,^scary
25-10-2018T23:25:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,which statement mihari?
25-10-2018T23:25:18,unsteddyphoenix,"But it's Reni, so it's somehow still cute"
25-10-2018T23:25:19,Ordithus,But then she :ctwokinds-reniderp:
25-10-2018T23:25:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-reniderp_flip:
25-10-2018T23:25:41,Mihari,Best dragon statement
25-10-2018T23:25:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,but she is XD
25-10-2018T23:26:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"look at her, all cute and awesome"
25-10-2018T23:26:12,Bgrmystr2,Mihari is a Nora fan confirmed?
25-10-2018T23:26:17,Vatruvius,Now you have upset the Mihari dragon Marv...
25-10-2018T23:26:17,CrRAR,(and not busty)
25-10-2018T23:26:19,unsteddyphoenix,Idk I really like Nora...
25-10-2018T23:26:24,unsteddyphoenix,Hmm.
25-10-2018T23:26:44,Mihari,I thought it was pretty obvious I was a Nora fan.
25-10-2018T23:26:58,Bgrmystr2,I don't pay attention :u
25-10-2018T23:27:00,CrRAR,Nora is OG dragon
25-10-2018T23:27:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Reni is the new hotness
25-10-2018T23:27:17,FenceEqualizer,Reni is new hotness tho
25-10-2018T23:27:19,Vatruvius,"Well, technically speaking Mihari is completely correct as Nora is the most powerful dragon in Mekkan."
25-10-2018T23:27:20,Bgrmystr2,everyone likes nora till they do what marv did and speak blasphemy.
25-10-2018T23:27:21,FenceEqualizer,Damn it
25-10-2018T23:27:22,CrRAR,haha
25-10-2018T23:27:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
25-10-2018T23:27:40,Vatruvius,"Nora, old and busted, Reni, new hotness..."
