03-12-2018T00:40:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Or tonight can be a cheat night

03-12-2018T07:21:58,Bgrmystr2,it's an easy fix.
03-12-2018T07:22:26,Bgrmystr2,Go to sleep instead of waking up.
03-12-2018T07:22:47,Bgrmystr2,your body won't know what even because everything is backwards.

03-12-2018T12:41:29,Dadrobit,"Holy shitballs. Pops just put in his official resignation this morning. One of the school admins tried brushing him off, so he told the guy to go fuck himself and wrote up his letter of resignation right then and there."
03-12-2018T12:42:08,CrimsonQuill,Hullo!
03-12-2018T12:42:09,Dadrobit,just walked out through the front office and told them to find a substitute for the day.
03-12-2018T12:42:20,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-greetings:
03-12-2018T12:43:21,Dadrobit,"30 something years, and this is his last one in the public school district. Just like that."
03-12-2018T12:44:51,Dadrobit,Gonna head over there and celebrate with him I guess?
03-12-2018T12:55:35,CrimsonQuill,Anyone here?
03-12-2018T13:02:38,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
03-12-2018T13:02:57,Twokinds,No
03-12-2018T13:02:58,CrimsonQuill,Hullo
03-12-2018T13:03:03,CrimsonQuill,I see you Tom
03-12-2018T13:12:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"No one’s here, gravity’s a myth, and the earth is flat"
03-12-2018T13:12:58,CrimsonQuill,The number three is a myth!
03-12-2018T13:26:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom did you ever see about the gifting subs
03-12-2018T13:26:48,Twokinds,I couldn't figure out how to contact Picarto
03-12-2018T13:26:58,CrimsonQuill,Whut
03-12-2018T13:27:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Customer support?
03-12-2018T13:27:40,iliar,Why do you need to contact Picarto?
03-12-2018T13:31:33,Twokinds,I would like to submit a suggestion to them.
03-12-2018T13:31:48,Twokinds,I think it would be nice if people had the ability to gift subs to others.
03-12-2018T13:32:05,CrimsonQuill,I was wondering what this was about
03-12-2018T13:33:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Nah tom was considering leaving Picarto and didn’t wanna tell anyone
03-12-2018T13:34:05,CrimsonQuill,"@SpazztasticKiwi oh, ha ha."
03-12-2018T13:34:26,iliar,Perhaps you're right. But honestly I don't see use case for this function.
03-12-2018T13:34:42,Twokinds,How not?
03-12-2018T13:34:54,iliar,How do you plan to use this feature?
03-12-2018T13:35:19,Twokinds,I would use it to gift subs to people.
03-12-2018T13:35:25,SpazztasticKiwi,To randomly give someone the gift of:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
03-12-2018T13:35:39,Twokinds,Ya
03-12-2018T13:35:52,Twokinds,And then maybe they like it and keep subbing. Or give a sub to someone else.
03-12-2018T13:35:56,CrimsonQuill,Everspamming Nibbly's
03-12-2018T13:36:04,Twokinds,"It would generate revenue for Picarto, and everyone would be able to Nibbly."
03-12-2018T13:36:11,Xexanoth,"yay dogwalking succesfull, now proceeding with stuffing my face with gingerbread."
03-12-2018T13:36:21,CrimsonQuill,"Actually, how did you come up with Mrs Nibbly anyhow Tom?"
03-12-2018T13:36:30,Xexanoth,Tom has been possesed by nibbly and now tries to spread her
03-12-2018T13:36:41,Xexanoth,it's like hypnotoad
03-12-2018T13:38:07,iliar,Wait. I try to understand. Do you want to be able to free your subscription for someone? Or are you willing to pay for someone else's subscription?
03-12-2018T13:38:19,Twokinds,Pay obviously.
03-12-2018T13:39:13,CrimsonQuill,Hmmm...
03-12-2018T13:39:16,iliar,This is... This is very generous
03-12-2018T13:39:22,Twokinds,"Picarto gets 25 cents per sub. So, it'd be just a quarter for me to gift it to someone."
03-12-2018T13:39:27,SpazztasticKiwi,There would be the downside of the occasional one that’d bug you for a second sub
03-12-2018T13:39:31,CrimsonQuill,Exceedingly generpous.
03-12-2018T13:39:38,CrimsonQuill,generous
03-12-2018T13:43:28,SpazztasticKiwi,And the reason I was on about the gifting subs would cause problems is that situation Mark had on twitch
03-12-2018T13:44:32,SpazztasticKiwi,He turned off the gifting cause fans were giving home subs that he’d have to remove later because getting a sub meant getting notifications for all activity for each gift
03-12-2018T13:44:38,SpazztasticKiwi,him
03-12-2018T13:45:09,Xexanoth,wouldn't that be more of a problem on how twitch handles notifications though?
03-12-2018T13:45:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah but he also did have his own follows I’m sure
03-12-2018T13:46:07,SpazztasticKiwi,And that would entail going in an fiddling with notifications so he got only all the notifications he wanted
03-12-2018T13:46:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Similar headache
03-12-2018T13:46:43,SpazztasticKiwi,He could explain it better if I’m not making sense but here’s likely very different than there as I said before
03-12-2018T13:46:57,iliar,"I know, 25 cents is not very big money. Probably even $ 5 is not very big money. But I'm still surprised that you want to give a subscription to someone from your fans."
03-12-2018T13:49:11,Twokinds,"Well yeah, I like seeing a bunch of :ctwokinds-nibsdance:"

03-12-2018T15:20:20,CrimsonQuill,Thank goodness...
03-12-2018T15:20:53,CrimsonQuill,I did read that some women did end up picking up guns during the most desperate times however.
03-12-2018T15:24:13,iliar,"Fun fact about this song. They sing with a terrible accent. Therefore, many Russian people can not make out exactly what they sing."

03-12-2018T15:25:34,CrimsonQuill,"Then again, I'm not Russian."

03-12-2018T17:46:36,Bgrmystr2,it's just a move to send you advertising
03-12-2018T17:48:10,SpazztasticKiwi,They’re reasoning is “update/progress messages”
03-12-2018T17:48:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"for packages and stuff. But since I get that, and more by comparison, with the email..."
03-12-2018T17:48:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t see a point

03-12-2018T17:51:47,SpazztasticKiwi,every one I’ve visited. When or if they ever they text I’m blocking
03-12-2018T17:53:30,Bgrmystr2,"they don't need it though, that's the thing. if they require it then you shouldn't be doing whatever it is that requires it in the  first place."

03-12-2018T17:57:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I shouldn’t be getting online stuff
03-12-2018T17:57:47,SpazztasticKiwi,?
03-12-2018T17:58:02,Bgrmystr2,"Usually, if a site needs my email, it's so I can have a way to change the password for logging in. Phone is for security, and I really only use that for important stuff."

03-12-2018T17:58:54,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s the sites wanting phones now to sent tracking stuff. And to help secure passwords it the email is lost or inaccessible

03-12-2018T17:59:35,Bgrmystr2,"usually that's fine imo, I just don't think their site is valuable enough most the time to give them my phone number"
03-12-2018T17:59:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"Problem is, they require it for the order to go though now. Many amazon like sites do now"
03-12-2018T18:00:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Because apparently more people like text tracking than using their email
03-12-2018T18:00:19,Bgrmystr2,"amazon I'd prolly trust w/ my phone number as newegg, but if it's something from, say, japan"
03-12-2018T18:00:22,Bgrmystr2,like amiami
03-12-2018T18:00:26,Bgrmystr2,then no
03-12-2018T18:00:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Two sites I’ve given it to are one time purchases as far as I’m concerned
03-12-2018T18:01:07,SpazztasticKiwi,They made a pest out of themselves with email ads
03-12-2018T18:01:32,SpazztasticKiwi,But they’re America based so
03-12-2018T18:07:01,Twokinds,"haha finally figure out how to set Alexa to say ""you're welcome"" when I say ""thank you"" after she does something for me."
03-12-2018T18:08:24,Bgrmystr2,finally taught her manners eh
03-12-2018T18:08:26,Bgrmystr2,good man
03-12-2018T18:08:33,Twokinds,It bothered me that I'd say thank you and she didn't say anything back.

03-12-2018T20:41:47,Bgrmystr2,and that's why they did it

03-12-2018T20:42:03,RimaDraws,pearl is junes gemstone
03-12-2018T20:42:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah they seems to be pretty dependent on birthstone color
03-12-2018T20:42:23,RimaDraws,cancers aren't born except mid june to mid july
03-12-2018T20:42:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Or the colors associated with the signs

03-12-2018T22:54:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I would expect you to be working on art. What else would you be doing? Socializing?
03-12-2018T22:54:19,RimaDraws,he kind of is doing that now
03-12-2018T22:55:12,SpazztasticKiwi,This is the minimalist’s socializing
03-12-2018T22:55:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh I almost forgot
03-12-2018T22:55:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Apparently last night my mom and sister forgot tot ell me Kiwi knocked over a candle last night

03-12-2018T22:56:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Physically
03-12-2018T22:56:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I had to shave the fur off her leg
03-12-2018T22:56:40,RimaDraws,aw poor baby
03-12-2018T22:57:59,Twokinds,lol
03-12-2018T22:58:14,SpazztasticKiwi,She’s not too happy with me
03-12-2018T22:58:19,Twokinds,I can imagine.
03-12-2018T22:58:40,RimaDraws,"like ""human i hate you"""
03-12-2018T22:58:42,RimaDraws,kinda like that
03-12-2018T22:59:20,RimaDraws,drawing chakats are difficult
03-12-2018T23:01:00,SpazztasticKiwi,At least she didn’t set herself on fire. She got f l u f f
03-12-2018T23:01:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Which makes the shaved leg all the funnier
03-12-2018T23:01:31,RimaDraws,lol
03-12-2018T23:02:39,SpazztasticKiwi,You get to see what I said happened last night with Bagheera?
03-12-2018T23:02:59,RimaDraws,no i dozed off a bit before bed time.
03-12-2018T23:03:07,RimaDraws,ive been tired lately with work
03-12-2018T23:03:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Well some change fell out of my pants when I put them on my bed after work
03-12-2018T23:03:51,SpazztasticKiwi,But I didn’t know until something under Bagheera jingled later
03-12-2018T23:03:52,RimaDraws,oh my he didn't eat them did he
03-12-2018T23:04:17,SpazztasticKiwi,He “laid” two quarters and a dime
03-12-2018T23:04:25,RimaDraws,he ate them then....
03-12-2018T23:04:27,RimaDraws,oh my
03-12-2018T23:04:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Nah he didn’t eat em
03-12-2018T23:04:46,RimaDraws,oh thank goodness
03-12-2018T23:05:14,SpazztasticKiwi,He was incubating them like a mother hen though
03-12-2018T23:05:21,RimaDraws,oh wow lol
03-12-2018T23:05:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"If they’d hatched, I’d have put my wallet under him next"
03-12-2018T23:06:23,RimaDraws,silly kitty
03-12-2018T23:08:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m considering getting a tracking chip for him for when I move
03-12-2018T23:08:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"But the problem is, he doesn’t walk up to strangers. And he’s not too easily caught"
03-12-2018T23:09:15,RimaDraws,i wouldn't advise against it but i dont know about putting tracking chips in them
03-12-2018T23:09:19,RimaDraws,i get unsure about taht
03-12-2018T23:09:21,RimaDraws,that*
03-12-2018T23:09:57,SpazztasticKiwi,A collar would work but only if it didn’t get hung on something and trap him or get lost
03-12-2018T23:10:12,RimaDraws,yea and if you had a tracking chip he would be found if lost
03-12-2018T23:10:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Further issue with that is he’s a black cat
03-12-2018T23:10:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Some people will kill a black cat on sight
03-12-2018T23:11:08,RimaDraws,yea i know that fear with my kitty qrow
03-12-2018T23:12:54,SpazztasticKiwi,And a chip only works if he’s turned into a shelter/vet with a reader
03-12-2018T23:13:16,Bgrmystr2,why will people kill a black cat on sight
03-12-2018T23:13:18,Bgrmystr2,that's stupid
03-12-2018T23:13:29,RimaDraws,because black cats are supposedly bad luck
03-12-2018T23:13:31,RimaDraws,and evil
03-12-2018T23:13:33,RimaDraws,but they arent
03-12-2018T23:13:35,SpazztasticKiwi,^
03-12-2018T23:13:51,RimaDraws,they are much more mild mannered cats than any other kind of cat ive had
03-12-2018T23:14:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera missed that memo
03-12-2018T23:15:20,Bgrmystr2,"yes but that's irrelevant. If you get bad luck, killing the cat doesn't REMOVE the bad luck, you're just causing more for yourself by murdering an animal and potentially causing yourself greif from those who own it"
03-12-2018T23:15:22,RimaDraws,mines alright. sometimes he gets wild but he is a good kitty
03-12-2018T23:17:17,SpazztasticKiwi,In some countries black cats are good luck if they cross your path
03-12-2018T23:17:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"For me, a cat crossing my path means I wanna pet it"
03-12-2018T23:21:24,RimaDraws,i love my black kitty
03-12-2018T23:22:03,unsteddyphoenix,"Trye bgr, if you see a black cat you've already been hit by any curse it may have"
03-12-2018T23:22:17,unsteddyphoenix,#Blackcatsmatter
03-12-2018T23:22:48,RimaDraws,hi unsteddy
03-12-2018T23:22:57,Bgrmystr2,right? And hey
03-12-2018T23:23:22,Bgrmystr2,like.. if you see a black cat and really truly believe it's bad luck... then you're already fucked. it's too late. cuz you saw it
03-12-2018T23:23:42,Bgrmystr2,ignoring that it's 175% arbitrary chance that you happened to look and it happened to be there
03-12-2018T23:23:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Perfect cure for prejudice: gouge out your eyes so you don’t see the difference
03-12-2018T23:24:02,Bgrmystr2,"at that point, you have the bad luck and nothing you do will change it."
03-12-2018T23:24:04,unsteddyphoenix,o/
03-12-2018T23:24:16,unsteddyphoenix,Exactly
03-12-2018T23:24:19,unsteddyphoenix,Might as well go pat the cat
03-12-2018T23:24:28,Bgrmystr2,yes!
03-12-2018T23:24:35,Bgrmystr2,go pet soft floof kitty
03-12-2018T23:24:37,unsteddyphoenix,If you walk under a ladder are you gonna go break the ladder?
03-12-2018T23:24:52,Bgrmystr2,"If you break a mirror, are you gonna go get it repaired?"
03-12-2018T23:24:53,Bgrmystr2,wait..
03-12-2018T23:24:57,unsteddyphoenix,Thats silly even for the dumb superstitious people
03-12-2018T23:25:00,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
03-12-2018T23:25:03,RimaDraws,lol
03-12-2018T23:25:05,unsteddyphoenix,Exactly!
03-12-2018T23:25:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Walk under the ladder with black kitty. Bad luck will cancel out
03-12-2018T23:25:27,unsteddyphoenix,"If you fit a mirror with a new pane, is it still the same mirror? :thinking:"
03-12-2018T23:25:36,Bgrmystr2,haha
03-12-2018T23:25:51,SpazztasticKiwi,What would you do if you saw your reflection blink
03-12-2018T23:26:06,Bgrmystr2,"well the reflective part is what you see yourself on, so I'm not really sure if replacing the glass part of the mirror matters."
03-12-2018T23:26:22,Bgrmystr2,"and if my reflection blinked, then obviously I did too, kiwi"
03-12-2018T23:26:26,Bgrmystr2,and I'd know about it
03-12-2018T23:26:41,unsteddyphoenix,"If you saw it blink, it means your eyes were open"
03-12-2018T23:26:47,Bgrmystr2,xD
03-12-2018T23:26:53,unsteddyphoenix,Dun dunn~
03-12-2018T23:26:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"Well if you saw it, it means it didn’t happen as your eyes were still open"
03-12-2018T23:27:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Which means either you’re experiencing lag or demons
03-12-2018T23:27:20,unsteddyphoenix,Need a new brain-router
03-12-2018T23:27:34,Twokinds,"I'm really bad at timing, so I always see myself blink."
03-12-2018T23:27:42,Bgrmystr2,"surprisingly, you can sort of see yourself blink cuz you can see it up until your eyes are just barely closed and it happens so quickly"
03-12-2018T23:27:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom is demon confirmed
03-12-2018T23:28:02,Bgrmystr2,"in fact, you can still see almost perfectly fine with your eyelids almost completely closed"
03-12-2018T23:28:07,unsteddyphoenix,His disguise is falling to pieces
03-12-2018T23:28:07,Bgrmystr2,if you're only looking at a small area

03-12-2018T23:31:27,SpazztasticKiwi,He is rather small for a tomcat actually
03-12-2018T23:31:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though being fixed, I guess he’s no longer a “tom”cat"
03-12-2018T23:33:38,SpazztasticKiwi,...and I realize now that looks absolutely awful considering Tom is here
