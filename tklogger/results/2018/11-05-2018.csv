11-05-2018T02:37:11,SpazztasticKiwi,So I might actually know what I’m doing tomorrow
11-05-2018T02:37:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,woohoo \o/
11-05-2018T02:37:42,Dadrobit,Back for a bit.
11-05-2018T02:37:49,Dadrobit,"Hey, Tom. You there?"
11-05-2018T02:38:00,Dadrobit,Are you still doing those teeth whitening things?
11-05-2018T02:38:07,Dadrobit,They work?
11-05-2018T02:39:08,Bgrmystr2,"brb, food should be done"
11-05-2018T02:40:01,unsteddyphoenix,Oh yeah
11-05-2018T02:40:01,Twokinds,"Uh, I stopped after about 5 treatments. (out of 20)"
11-05-2018T02:40:09,unsteddyphoenix,No good huh
11-05-2018T02:40:23,Twokinds,"They did work, but it left my teeth feeling sore."
11-05-2018T02:40:38,Twokinds,"I could probably use it more, but I felt like it was white enough."
11-05-2018T02:40:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Probably not too good then
11-05-2018T02:41:08,SpazztasticKiwi,The treatment that is
11-05-2018T02:41:13,Twokinds,I'm not aiming for those paint white teeth anyway.
11-05-2018T02:41:17,unsteddyphoenix,"Huh, so they do work"
11-05-2018T02:41:24,Twokinds,Yeah.
11-05-2018T02:41:24,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I get that
11-05-2018T02:41:28,unsteddyphoenix,"Ok, cool."
11-05-2018T02:41:29,SpazztasticKiwi,They can make you look creepy if they’re too white
11-05-2018T02:41:33,unsteddyphoenix,Might look into it
11-05-2018T02:41:40,Justanotheruser7118,Hi everyone
11-05-2018T02:41:49,Dadrobit,"Huh, odd that they become painful."
11-05-2018T02:42:02,unsteddyphoenix,"Has anyone played ""A house of many doors""?"
11-05-2018T02:42:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Ever thought of having that laser eye thing done again?
11-05-2018T02:42:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I have thought about it
11-05-2018T02:42:47,Bgrmystr2,"what were they called, Tom? :o"
11-05-2018T02:42:49,Bgrmystr2,what you used
11-05-2018T02:43:01,Dadrobit,Have you looked it up to see if that's a common side effect? Or is it just you?
11-05-2018T02:43:34,Justanotheruser7118,"Sorry, can anyone tell me whats going on now?"
11-05-2018T02:43:47,SpazztasticKiwi,General conversation
11-05-2018T02:43:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Or maybe interrogation is a better word
11-05-2018T02:44:01,Justanotheruser7118,kek
11-05-2018T02:45:15,Twokinds,Sore teeth is a common side effect.
11-05-2018T02:45:54,Twokinds,"The soreness didn't last long. I wouldn't call it ""painful"" but I dunno how it'd be if I kept going."
11-05-2018T02:46:58,Dadrobit,"Hm, I think I'll just stick to my teeth whitening toothpaste."
11-05-2018T02:47:03,LovingDreams1995,hello :3
11-05-2018T02:47:35,Dadrobit,"Doesn't give me perfectly white teeth, but it works well enough."
11-05-2018T02:47:42,DarthRexKing,I am going to bed. Bye.
11-05-2018T02:47:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Seems like a good plan

11-05-2018T02:48:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Whether that works is to be determined
11-05-2018T02:49:44,Dadrobit,good luck
11-05-2018T02:56:06,Bgrmystr2,So I've got food

11-05-2018T02:57:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Feel like I’ve had those before
11-05-2018T02:58:18,Dadrobit,Pigs in a blanket they're called.
11-05-2018T02:58:29,Bgrmystr2,"Tis an ugly name, Dadro. I never liked it"
11-05-2018T02:58:40,ZRO4825,"I call them delicious, usually."
11-05-2018T02:58:46,Bgrmystr2,xD same zro
11-05-2018T03:00:15,ZRO4825,:czro4825-ViknAHH:

11-05-2018T03:01:46,Bgrmystr2,now you just need.. 49 other reaction faces.
11-05-2018T03:01:51,Bgrmystr2,so you're ready for anything.
11-05-2018T03:01:56,ZRO4825,I only get another 9 slots for basic D:
11-05-2018T03:02:04,Bgrmystr2,RIP
11-05-2018T03:02:36,Bgrmystr2,that was a pretty easy butt color :thinking:
11-05-2018T03:02:48,ZRO4825,"Sage, isn't it illegal for Nyna to look that cute? :o"
11-05-2018T03:02:52,Bgrmystr2,no
11-05-2018T03:02:56,Bgrmystr2,who made that law
11-05-2018T03:03:03,ZRO4825,Well I didn't say it was a law that made sense!
11-05-2018T03:03:09,Bgrmystr2,&gt;:T
11-05-2018T03:03:49,Bgrmystr2,"Y'know what, this image is a perfect base for sage to make a butt dance from"
11-05-2018T03:03:57,SageSaga,Nyna is very cute - but so are lions and tigers and panthers- it does not mean they cannot eat your face
11-05-2018T03:04:04,ZRO4825,"True, true..."
11-05-2018T03:04:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Just because it’s cute doesn’t mean you should take a selfie with it
11-05-2018T03:04:46,Bgrmystr2,or sleep with one?
11-05-2018T03:04:55,ZRO4825,....it'd be worth it. Maybe.
11-05-2018T03:04:57,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
11-05-2018T03:05:12,ZRO4825,"'cept iirc Nyna's not into dudes, so....end result would NOT be worth it :V"
11-05-2018T03:05:33,SpazztasticKiwi,“Got my boys chewed off but man it was worth it” seems logical
11-05-2018T03:06:17,OniRayoh1991,"So ""Yosh!"" has been going one for about nine years now. Wow... :&gt;"
11-05-2018T03:06:22,Bgrmystr2,"Welp, tom updated the page"
11-05-2018T03:06:55,SageSaga,9 years?
11-05-2018T03:07:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Weeee
11-05-2018T03:07:20,SageSaga,that information is incorrect
11-05-2018T03:07:21,OniRayoh1991,"Well, the series. Unless it's getting there."
11-05-2018T03:07:37,SageSaga,it will be 15 years in November
11-05-2018T03:07:53,OniRayoh1991,Holy smokes! lol
11-05-2018T03:08:04,SageSaga,it started in 2003
11-05-2018T03:08:13,ZRO4825,Trying to remember when I actually found it myself...
11-05-2018T03:08:34,FluffKevlar,Nyna butt &lt;3
11-05-2018T03:09:26,ZRO4825,FLUFF! :czro4825-ViknAHH:
11-05-2018T03:09:28,SageSaga,Fluff- you need to draw Nyna butt  - and link back to AI because i need more readers-
11-05-2018T03:09:40,ZRO4825,"Sorry, Fluff."
11-05-2018T03:09:46,Justanotheruser7118,lol
11-05-2018T03:09:49,ZRO4825,It made too good a panic emote. :3
11-05-2018T03:10:14,ZRO4825,Fluff drawn Nyna butt would be good stuff. :o
11-05-2018T03:10:40,FluffKevlar,what the heck
11-05-2018T03:10:49,FluffKevlar,who made an angry Vikna gif??
11-05-2018T03:10:56,OniRayoh1991,"Yeah and I guess you took hiatus from the comic series sometimes; or switch in-between it and ""Artificial Incident""?"
11-05-2018T03:10:56,ZRO4825,( '.')/
11-05-2018T03:11:00,Bgrmystr2,"It's not, it's a surprised vikna"
11-05-2018T03:11:08,FluffKevlar,ZRO did?
11-05-2018T03:11:12,ZRO4825,I did
11-05-2018T03:11:12,OniRayoh1991,The drawing is coming along good. :&gt;
11-05-2018T03:11:14,FluffKevlar,and yeah i want to draw Nyna's butt
11-05-2018T03:11:27,FluffKevlar,I've only drawn her from the front so far
11-05-2018T03:11:52,FluffKevlar,speaking of which I still need to post that bra doodle
11-05-2018T03:12:13,OniRayoh1991,"That would be a nice addition for your ""Quest for Booty"". lol"
11-05-2018T03:12:55,ZRO4825,The neverending quest of Fluff.
11-05-2018T03:13:40,OniRayoh1991,Steamed Hams but with Yosh characters.
11-05-2018T03:14:29,unsteddyphoenix,"im glad youre finishing this tonight sage, looks great :D"
11-05-2018T03:14:52,Bgrmystr2,agree w/ phoenix

11-05-2018T03:16:48,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
11-05-2018T03:17:20,OniRayoh1991,Which would come in handy.
11-05-2018T03:21:07,Dadrobit,:/ The online student enrollment center is screwing with me...
11-05-2018T03:21:25,unsteddyphoenix,:thinking:
11-05-2018T03:21:27,Dadrobit,Not letting me sign up for my class.
11-05-2018T03:21:42,Dadrobit,Literally the last class I need for my certification.
11-05-2018T03:21:52,unsteddyphoenix,youd think a university would have a functioning online system
11-05-2018T03:21:59,Dadrobit,You'd think so.
11-05-2018T03:22:23,SpazztasticKiwi,“Nah. Don’t feel like working right now”
11-05-2018T03:22:53,Dadrobit,"Earlier it wouldn't let me enroll because I had to update my information. And now that that is done, it's not letting me enroll in the class because it says I have a duplicate enrollment or something in that class already."
11-05-2018T03:23:16,ZRO4825,-.- I hate when online shit does crap like that.
11-05-2018T03:23:20,OniRayoh1991,Aw... :c
11-05-2018T03:23:59,Dadrobit,"I've tried deleting the class and selecting it again, but I keep on getting this stupid 18,2 error."
11-05-2018T03:24:19,unsteddyphoenix,Ugh you havta make a PHONE CALL now

11-05-2018T03:24:48,Dadrobit,1:30am on a Saturday. Gonna bargain that no one's gonna answer.
11-05-2018T03:25:01,ZRO4825,"....wth, that background was fast Sage o.o I just looked away for a moment, lol"
11-05-2018T03:25:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Email then
11-05-2018T03:25:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,send a pigeon

11-05-2018T03:25:45,Bgrmystr2,"You expect them to read any emails till monday, Kiwi?"
11-05-2018T03:25:47,Bgrmystr2,hahaha
11-05-2018T03:25:51,Dadrobit,Only 3 spots left in this class. I am going to be very upset if I don't get in...
11-05-2018T03:26:30,OniRayoh1991,"Well, I'm hoping to finally getting this drawing I've been working on finish. I hope it's alright if I can share it for next stream."
11-05-2018T03:26:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Log out and log back in? Refresh page? I dunno
11-05-2018T03:26:43,unsteddyphoenix,"Might be able to appeal if like, it recorded you trying or something"
11-05-2018T03:26:51,Bgrmystr2,As long as you can prove you applied for it
11-05-2018T03:26:59,Bgrmystr2,then you can appeal if they deny you that class yeah
11-05-2018T03:27:04,unsteddyphoenix,"Actually maybe send an email now anyway, just for proof that it happened when you said"
11-05-2018T03:27:10,Bgrmystr2,yeah for sure
11-05-2018T03:27:21,SpazztasticKiwi,With a screenshot of the error page too maybe
11-05-2018T03:27:24,Bgrmystr2,"even if they don't read it till monday, that alone is already proof"
11-05-2018T03:27:26,Bgrmystr2,and yeah that ^
11-05-2018T03:27:35,OniRayoh1991,Yay! :&gt;
11-05-2018T03:27:42,Bgrmystr2,"if their servers bug off, that's not your fault"
11-05-2018T03:27:46,unsteddyphoenix,"Ive been in a my word VS their word sitaution with my lecturer, it didnt end well for me, proof is good"
11-05-2018T03:28:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Take alllll the screenshots

11-05-2018T03:35:17,Bgrmystr2,"End of this month is the con, yes?"
11-05-2018T03:35:20,Bgrmystr2,the one you're going to?
11-05-2018T03:35:29,unsteddyphoenix,Gotta dnd while you can
11-05-2018T03:35:31,iliar,"Thank you, Tom. Good night."
11-05-2018T03:35:51,unsteddyphoenix,Though maybe they could do it at the con if the internets good enough :thinking:
11-05-2018T03:36:20,SageSaga,yeah not next week but the week after
11-05-2018T03:36:25,SageSaga,no streams that week
11-05-2018T03:37:01,unsteddyphoenix,We will be lost and confused
11-05-2018T03:37:10,Bgrmystr2,RIP :(
11-05-2018T03:37:27,ZRO4825,"I will be! I'll be all like ""It's Friday, streams!"" get home and be like ""Oh yeah, no stream"" and then I'mma be all night like ""Well shit, now what?"""
11-05-2018T03:37:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"if no stream then, then we might have to........ draw our own stuff :ptv-whiny:"
11-05-2018T03:37:44,ZRO4825,:thinking: Gonna be like every other night of the week D:
11-05-2018T03:37:47,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock:
11-05-2018T03:37:55,Bgrmystr2,"Marv, how will we survive!"
11-05-2018T03:37:56,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
11-05-2018T03:37:58,ZRO4825,"I'm trying to do that Marv, it's not working well so far. :joy:"
11-05-2018T03:38:02,unsteddyphoenix,Set up our OWN stream
11-05-2018T03:38:08,Bgrmystr2,hahaha
11-05-2018T03:38:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
11-05-2018T03:38:21,ZRO4825,"Can edit pictures like no tomorrow, but I try to draw one of my own and suddenly everything goes to crap. :joy:"
11-05-2018T03:38:32,unsteddyphoenix,We dont need them what with their SKILL and EXPERIENCE! Feh!
11-05-2018T03:38:46,ZRO4825,"Talent, Unsteddy. It's obviously all just pure talent."
11-05-2018T03:39:00,Bgrmystr2,xD
11-05-2018T03:39:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,thought sage said talent does not exist?
11-05-2018T03:39:09,unsteddyphoenix,With the power of friendship we can overcome their talent!
11-05-2018T03:39:18,ZRO4825,:joy:
11-05-2018T03:39:23,ZRO4825,"Nope, I just lost the game after that one."
11-05-2018T03:39:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,friendship? what is this Fairy Tail
11-05-2018T03:39:36,Bgrmystr2,"Motherfucker I just lost the game too, zro &gt;:C"
11-05-2018T03:39:53,ZRO4825,I'm good with it being Fairy Tail! Erza and Lucy &lt;3
11-05-2018T03:40:10,ZRO4825,:thinking:
11-05-2018T03:40:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"seeing how I have 2 fairy tail posters, I'm cool with it too XD"
11-05-2018T03:40:26,ZRO4825,"Idea for month after next's picture! Oh, Serenaaaa~~"
11-05-2018T03:41:44,ZRO4825,Hmm...could put Serena in one of Erza's outfits and then month after put Michelle in one of Lucy's :o
11-05-2018T03:42:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,natsu's out fit
11-05-2018T03:42:20,Dadrobit,"Back, sent an email with a copy of the error message as well as a screenshot of the issue."
11-05-2018T03:42:24,Dadrobit,Here's hoping...
11-05-2018T03:42:27,ZRO4825,Why would we put one of them in Natsu's outfit? XD
11-05-2018T03:42:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,open front
11-05-2018T03:42:35,Dadrobit,"Also, if you're still lurking, have a good night, Tom."
11-05-2018T03:44:01,ZRO4825,"None of Lucy's outfits ever stay in one piece anyway, Marv, what's the difference? :P"
11-05-2018T03:44:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"hmmm, Grey's outfit"
11-05-2018T03:44:31,ZRO4825,Well that's just cheating. lol
11-05-2018T03:44:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
11-05-2018T03:44:44,ZRO4825,"Besides, then Juvia would just get irritated cuz someone stole Grey's pants. :P"
11-05-2018T03:44:49,ZRO4825,....or thankful
11-05-2018T03:44:53,ZRO4825,not sure which first. :thinking:
11-05-2018T03:58:31,SageSaga,done
11-05-2018T03:58:35,ZRO4825,Very nice ^_^
11-05-2018T03:58:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Very Nicely Done
11-05-2018T03:58:55,Bgrmystr2,"Marv, gemmy a buttdance/10 :D"
11-05-2018T03:59:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-FloDance:
11-05-2018T03:59:06,unsteddyphoenix,Quality :ok_hand:
11-05-2018T03:59:20,Bgrmystr2,Thanks
11-05-2018T03:59:22,SageSaga,well-
11-05-2018T03:59:25,SageSaga,8 hours
11-05-2018T03:59:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Almost W0lfy hours
11-05-2018T03:59:43,SageSaga,while depressed
11-05-2018T03:59:51,Bgrmystr2,":ok_hand: This is very nice, don't be depressed on us :u"
11-05-2018T03:59:56,Bgrmystr2,you did good
11-05-2018T04:00:02,ZRO4825,"Anything we can help with, Sage? :("
11-05-2018T04:00:37,SageSaga,most of it no- but part of it was seeing the actual traffic numbers for AI
11-05-2018T04:00:56,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
11-05-2018T04:00:57,SageSaga,the other stuff is more personal and emotional garbage
11-05-2018T04:01:01,unsteddyphoenix,"So, refresh the page a bunch?"
11-05-2018T04:01:07,Dadrobit,:( Sorry to hear man.
11-05-2018T04:01:13,ZRO4825,Ahhh. Well that sucks. Wish I could do more to help. :(
11-05-2018T04:01:19,SageSaga,refreshing the page doesnt help
11-05-2018T04:01:26,unsteddyphoenix,Dangit.
11-05-2018T04:01:32,Bgrmystr2,"even if it did, it wouldn't really.. bring new viewers."
11-05-2018T04:01:35,ZRO4825,"I'm always around if ya just need an ear. I suck at a lot of other things, but I'm a good listener. ^_^"
11-05-2018T04:01:40,unsteddyphoenix,"We probably cant do anything to help then but, hope you get past it man :)"
11-05-2018T04:01:49,SageSaga,if ya know people that like comics- recommend AI... bout as good as i can hope for
11-05-2018T04:01:54,ZRO4825,"Okay, i'm good for terrible humor at times too. Bgr can attest to that."
11-05-2018T04:02:14,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-SteelwormHades: I know not what you speak
11-05-2018T04:02:20,unsteddyphoenix,every little bit helps huh? Alright i'll try~
11-05-2018T04:02:25,ZRO4825,I will slap you with a fish. D:
11-05-2018T04:02:44,Bgrmystr2,"I'd slap you with a wet pool noodle, but the last time I tried that, there was a war over it."
11-05-2018T04:02:48,Bgrmystr2,So I won't. :X
11-05-2018T04:03:11,ZRO4825,Seems like the smart choice.
11-05-2018T04:03:24,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
11-05-2018T04:04:03,Bgrmystr2,"I'll rep AI to anyone who reads webcomics, but anyone I know who reads webcomics.. basically already knows about AI :u"
11-05-2018T04:04:06,ZRO4825,"Seriously though, Sage, if ya need anything I CAN help with possibly, gimme a shout. Only time I don't answer discord is if I'm dead to the world asleep, or stuck at work and it's really busy (and even then I usually find time to respond)"
11-05-2018T04:04:29,Bgrmystr2,can attest to that ^
11-05-2018T04:04:38,SageSaga,ive got a vacation coming up
11-05-2018T04:04:45,SageSaga,i hope it helps
11-05-2018T04:04:48,Bgrmystr2,going to that con will be a nice break
11-05-2018T04:04:57,SageSaga,though im gonna go crazy not being able to work on AI
11-05-2018T04:05:06,Bgrmystr2,"don't gotta worry about work, or stream or drawing, just relax"
11-05-2018T04:05:08,unsteddyphoenix,Haha
11-05-2018T04:05:19,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah try to have fun and put it out of your mind
11-05-2018T04:05:20,Bgrmystr2,don't fret yourself or you won't have fun
11-05-2018T04:05:21,ZRO4825,"I hope so too man, I know the feeling of needing a vacation. Had to kinda force my boss ti give me one a little while ago before I murdered a co-worker."
11-05-2018T04:05:23,unsteddyphoenix,What else can you do~
11-05-2018T04:05:29,SageSaga,oh and yeah- what drives me crazy is how much work i put into AI vs Yosh- and Yosh  has more than double the visitors
11-05-2018T04:05:57,SageSaga,and i cant fathom how such a small portion of Yosh readers have gone over to read AI
11-05-2018T04:06:05,ZRO4825,":thinking: Well, it's also got a much larger presence atm, too, right? Updates 3 times a week versus once, and such?"
11-05-2018T04:06:19,SageSaga,this was a Day vs Day data
11-05-2018T04:06:46,Bgrmystr2,I think that's a little backwards though. I mean think about it this way sage. If AI had half the viewers of Yosh.. Yosh has been there for YEARS and YEARS. AI has been there for how very little time?
11-05-2018T04:07:18,SageSaga,but i already have a platform - Yosh started on a forum with like 10 people reading it
11-05-2018T04:07:20,Bgrmystr2,"and already has a percentage of Yosh, in probably a fraction of the time it took Yosh"
11-05-2018T04:07:30,ZRO4825,"Well, I mean, if he's just comparing Wed to Wed, then it makes sense to compare, somewhat. Yosh! followers will definitely know about AI, he's been plugging it on Yosh since it started up."
11-05-2018T04:07:35,SageSaga,of course it would take forever- but its been 2 years -
11-05-2018T04:07:41,unsteddyphoenix,That is a bit weird though. Youd think fans who stuck around for Yosh would be at least keeping up with AI
11-05-2018T04:07:50,ZRO4825,^ exactly
11-05-2018T04:08:14,SageSaga,so - for the week that im gone im gonna put an ad on the filler for AI
11-05-2018T04:08:18,SageSaga,see if it does anything-
11-05-2018T04:08:21,ZRO4825,"I mean, I'm definitely keeping up with both, share'em as much as I can on FB every week too."
11-05-2018T04:08:29,Bgrmystr2,"maybe, Sage."
11-05-2018T04:08:38,Bgrmystr2,Have you done an ad for AI as a filler for Yosh before?
11-05-2018T04:08:39,unsteddyphoenix,Nothin to lose
11-05-2018T04:08:43,SageSaga,im also thinking about creating a Youtube ad...
11-05-2018T04:09:01,SageSaga,ive had Blue and Kate dress up as Nyna and Kaylin
11-05-2018T04:09:02,ZRO4825,:o
11-05-2018T04:09:06,unsteddyphoenix,Youtube ad? How would that work.
11-05-2018T04:09:17,ZRO4825,Moving pictures and sounds.
11-05-2018T04:09:20,SageSaga,well ive seen ads for regular books-
11-05-2018T04:09:20,unsteddyphoenix,Would it be like those ones that play as soon as you open the page :thinking:
11-05-2018T04:09:26,SageSaga,so i think a comic should be easy
11-05-2018T04:10:00,SageSaga,the youtube one- yeah kinda? but the one on the filler will just be ON the filler reminding people I have another comic
11-05-2018T04:10:14,SageSaga,because im worried a lot of people only look at the comic- and not my comments under it
11-05-2018T04:10:27,SageSaga,or even some just look at the comic ON twitter!
11-05-2018T04:10:32,SageSaga,they dont click the link-
11-05-2018T04:10:46,unsteddyphoenix,Huh. I never thought about that :thinking:
11-05-2018T04:10:48,ZRO4825,It's probably not helping your case that katbox throws an ad RIGHT under the comic page now.
11-05-2018T04:10:58,unsteddyphoenix,"Why link the page on twitter then, seems counterproductive"
11-05-2018T04:11:01,ZRO4825,So people are seeing Comic &gt; ad &gt; screw that go elsewhere.
11-05-2018T04:11:11,SageSaga,we need that ad
11-05-2018T04:11:17,SageSaga,it keeps the server running
11-05-2018T04:11:30,ZRO4825,"Oh I'm not doubting that, I'm just saying it's placement might be part of why your comments aren't being seen."
11-05-2018T04:12:14,ZRO4825,"People probably scroll down far enough to see the ad, realize that's the end of the page for now, and nope out to whatever page is next on their agenda."
11-05-2018T04:12:27,SageSaga,the ad at the top goes to me- i get maybe 40 bucks a month from the ad
11-05-2018T04:12:54,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: that.. doesn't sound bad
11-05-2018T04:13:10,Bgrmystr2,"It won't pay for a lot, but it'd help towards server costs for sure"
11-05-2018T04:13:17,ZRO4825,"I'm glad ya get at least that much, I've heard of people with ads on pages that get them literally dollars a month. Like, less than $5."
11-05-2018T04:13:38,SageSaga,40 is not good - 5 is terrible
11-05-2018T04:13:47,unsteddyphoenix,Do you do the thing where under the ad you ask people to turn off adblock?
11-05-2018T04:13:47,ZRO4825,....does refreshing the page help with THAT aspect? =D
11-05-2018T04:13:48,SageSaga,remember my comic has been around for 15 years
11-05-2018T04:15:28,SageSaga,most places are like also it means my ad is on over 2069 pages...
11-05-2018T04:15:42,SageSaga,ignore most places
11-05-2018T04:15:45,SageSaga,and are
11-05-2018T04:15:56,SageSaga,i was typing something else- got distracted and kept typing
11-05-2018T04:16:05,SageSaga,woo
11-05-2018T04:16:10,ZRO4825,cannot tell you how many times I've done that myself :joy:
11-05-2018T04:16:37,ZRO4825,"fun part? Half the time I don't even get distracted, I just forget part of what I wrote at the beginning by the time I get to the end. XD"
11-05-2018T04:19:23,Bgrmystr2,Somethin somethin distracted by nyna's shiney butt? :ptv-wondering:
11-05-2018T04:19:36,ZRO4825,"sorry, wut? Booty :o"
11-05-2018T04:19:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"nyna's shiney butt, waxed 3 times a day"
11-05-2018T04:20:07,SageSaga,why would you do that-
11-05-2018T04:20:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,for that shine
11-05-2018T04:20:21,Bgrmystr2,yeah that kinda sounds painful
11-05-2018T04:20:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,nothing shines better then auto wax
11-05-2018T04:20:44,Bgrmystr2,I was just thinking of like.. one of those soft buff pads or somethin
11-05-2018T04:20:53,ZRO4825,Sounds painful for whoever has to apply the wax. Since I doubt Nyna's going to appreciate it. :joy:
11-05-2018T04:20:54,Bgrmystr2,"as long as it's not spinning too fast, anyway"
11-05-2018T04:20:55,unsteddyphoenix,lol
11-05-2018T04:20:56,unsteddyphoenix,kinky
11-05-2018T04:21:17,Bgrmystr2,"Well, thanks for streamin sage"
11-05-2018T04:21:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,one of those buffer wheels they use on cars
11-05-2018T04:21:30,unsteddyphoenix,thanks for the stream man
11-05-2018T04:21:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Nighty night Sage, Thanks for the stram"
11-05-2018T04:21:59,Bgrmystr2,"unless somethin happens to me, I'll probably stay a reader for AI, cuz I really like it"
11-05-2018T04:22:06,Bgrmystr2,so don't you worry bout that :v
11-05-2018T04:22:23,Bgrmystr2,take it easy and don't let it stress you so much
11-05-2018T04:24:25,Dadrobit,"Cya Sage, thanks for the arts."
11-05-2018T04:31:39,ZRO4825,wtf Picarto. you're cuttin off part of the offline screen ya idjits.
11-05-2018T04:31:57,SageSaga,guess i gotta change it
11-05-2018T04:32:03,SageSaga,but not now- im busy
11-05-2018T04:32:17,ZRO4825,Picarto just needs to undo their update methinks at this rate. lol
11-05-2018T04:32:35,ZRO4825,"Or at least the stylistic parts of it, lol"
11-05-2018T04:32:54,ZRO4825,"Seriously ain't sure why they had to go screwin with that anyway. It weren't broke, why fix it? lol"
11-05-2018T04:34:02,Bgrmystr2,"exactly, zro. that's my problem. the page itself covers up part of the stream player"
11-05-2018T04:34:07,Bgrmystr2,both the top and bottom :/
11-05-2018T04:34:13,ZRO4825,"Welp, I'm off to bed myself. Work at 2, wahoo. -.-/  Ya'll have a good night, Sage, good stream to ya tomorrow. Hopefully I'll get time to pop my head in :o"
11-05-2018T04:34:39,SageSaga,gnight folks

11-05-2018T04:45:15,Dadrobit,"Bluh, booted up the old PS4 for the first time in forever, very rusty."
11-05-2018T09:57:22,UnknownEnd,...
11-05-2018T11:19:06,totallynotTrace,The old ps4? I still only have a ps3 as a gaming device (i can play some games on super low settings on my laptop)
11-05-2018T12:50:51,TheGamePlayer,Hey oh!!!
11-05-2018T12:55:32,Vatruvius,Ugh...my power just went out. :ptv-unimpressed:
11-05-2018T13:10:42,Vatruvius,"Wow, three hours until you can get a technician out huh. They must be really busy and all in our ""huge"" area..."
11-05-2018T14:17:22,Trevuxnouxe,"Trace, like roblox?"
11-05-2018T15:21:04,Bgrmystr2,"Rip, vatru. Tis how you know the ""X hours till technician"" tends to be garbage. Friend of mine gets the same problem as a technician, and it's 100% from higher-ups mis-managing the schedule and asking impossible things of people"
11-05-2018T15:21:17,Bgrmystr2,like doing a job before the part even comes in..
11-05-2018T15:21:45,Bgrmystr2,or driving out to a place 2 hours away within the next hour.

11-05-2018T16:14:32,Vatruvius,"Well, my power is back. But really, it is not tgat complicated."

11-05-2018T16:47:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Forgot how bad it is walking in 90 degree heat with long hair
11-05-2018T16:47:58,Vatruvius,Did you now?

11-05-2018T16:49:09,Vatruvius,Luckily it does not get humid and hot where I live.
11-05-2018T17:17:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Found out a friend of mine’s guardian let this other girl just learning how to drive to drive her car
11-05-2018T17:17:21,SpazztasticKiwi,It didn’t end well
11-05-2018T17:22:35,Xexanoth,poor car

11-05-2018T17:59:10,Bgrmystr2,humidity here where I live gets to 100% during the year sometimes....
11-05-2018T17:59:18,Vatruvius,"On a brighter note, nothing like doing some Mother's Day shopping."
11-05-2018T17:59:33,Vatruvius,I feel for you Bgr.
11-05-2018T17:59:42,Bgrmystr2,"and cuz gulf coast, it's also hot too."

11-05-2018T18:00:10,Bgrmystr2,feels like you're melting
11-05-2018T18:00:24,Bgrmystr2,"ain't fun, tell you what"
11-05-2018T18:03:40,aleXxS,Hello
11-05-2018T18:24:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not sure how bad you’d call the damage. Front bumper got knocked loose and half the undercarriage is hanging off
11-05-2018T18:26:00,Vatruvius,I would say that is bad but I totaled my car in my accident two years ago.
11-05-2018T18:40:28,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"jeez, spazz"
11-05-2018T18:40:35,ItsActuallyKopyKat,That's quite the collision
11-05-2018T18:58:34,SpazztasticKiwi,She ran into a ditch and got stuck actually
11-05-2018T19:02:49,ItsActuallyKopyKat,yikes

11-05-2018T19:11:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Doesn’t look like it
11-05-2018T19:11:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Already ate before anyway
11-05-2018T19:11:16,ItsActuallyKopyKat,ah
11-05-2018T19:11:21,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"thinking ahead, that's smart"
11-05-2018T19:11:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Snow cones and lemonade though

11-05-2018T19:12:57,SpazztasticKiwi,At least she was when she was a kitten
11-05-2018T19:13:16,ItsActuallyKopyKat,lol well isn't that convenient :ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
11-05-2018T19:13:42,SpazztasticKiwi,It was a play on words and convenience
11-05-2018T19:14:06,Bgrmystr2,"So you're not SpazztasticKiwi, you're the OWNER if spazztastic Kiwi"
11-05-2018T19:14:10,Bgrmystr2,:v
11-05-2018T19:14:14,Bgrmystr2,It all makes sense

11-05-2018T19:15:20,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Works just fine lol
11-05-2018T19:15:33,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"(That's...that's not your name, is it?)"
11-05-2018T19:15:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Not even close
11-05-2018T19:16:16,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"how can a name be ""close?"" lol, it's either right or it isn't"
11-05-2018T19:20:17,SpazztasticKiwi,It can be close if it starts with the same letter or has the same amount of letters
11-05-2018T19:20:50,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"hmm ok, fair enough"
11-05-2018T19:28:34,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno about the same amount of letters, cuz that's too vague. Maybe if it rhymes or somethin"
11-05-2018T19:29:14,Bgrmystr2,like Jen or Gwen or Pen or whatnot
11-05-2018T19:32:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Ever heard of the scramblr?
11-05-2018T19:32:13,ItsActuallyKopyKat,oh god yes

11-05-2018T19:32:22,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Love that machine of justice
11-05-2018T19:32:27,ItsActuallyKopyKat,It's superb
11-05-2018T19:32:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"It’s nice to go on, especially if you wanna get closer to your friends"
11-05-2018T19:33:12,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"and by closer you mean...like a lot closer, right?"
11-05-2018T19:33:19,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Like squashed up next to em?
11-05-2018T19:33:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Squished like sardines
11-05-2018T19:33:31,ItsActuallyKopyKat,lol
11-05-2018T19:34:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember I got on with two of my friends. Both guys - I was on the outside
11-05-2018T19:34:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I warned them we’d get squished
11-05-2018T19:34:50,ItsActuallyKopyKat,but they insisted?
11-05-2018T19:35:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Ride operator ended up telling us one of them couldn’t stay so he got on another pod
11-05-2018T19:35:34,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"awww, poor lad"
11-05-2018T19:36:08,SpazztasticKiwi,It wasn’t too bad on him. I’m not terribly heavy
11-05-2018T19:36:22,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"i mean your other friend, who had to go on the other pod"
11-05-2018T19:36:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I know
11-05-2018T19:36:29,Bgrmystr2,too heavy for one?
11-05-2018T19:37:22,SpazztasticKiwi,They were bigger guys even without the height. Wider shoulders too
11-05-2018T19:39:09,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Well, guys do tend to have wider shoulders"
11-05-2018T19:43:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Still friends with one
11-05-2018T19:45:57,ItsActuallyKopyKat,with one what?
11-05-2018T19:46:19,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"lol, with one of your friends?"
11-05-2018T19:52:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah. Though we don’t talk all that much either way anyway
11-05-2018T19:53:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Time isn’t very existent when you get a job
11-05-2018T19:53:45,ItsActuallyKopyKat,That is very true
11-05-2018T19:54:46,Dadrobit,\o/ The online student center is finally working properly!
11-05-2018T19:55:06,Dadrobit,Got my class all settled in.
11-05-2018T19:55:10,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"that's always a good thing, dadro"
11-05-2018T19:55:38,Dadrobit,Yes it is. Wasn't being so kind last night.
11-05-2018T20:07:38,ItsActuallyKopyKat,ah
11-05-2018T20:18:15,Bgrmystr2,"oh nice, you got the class and it's all fixed? did you end up calling someone Dadro?"
11-05-2018T20:18:22,Bgrmystr2,or did the online system just work in general
11-05-2018T20:26:13,Dadrobit,"Don't know if someone went to my account to fix anything or not, but when I went to confirm my class selection today, it just worked like it should have."
11-05-2018T20:26:33,Bgrmystr2,so you got the class you wanted and everything's in order then?
11-05-2018T20:26:38,Dadrobit,"Didn't get an email back, so I dunno if anyone went to the backend of my account or not."
11-05-2018T20:26:57,Dadrobit,"Ayep, hopefully the last class I'm ever gonna need."
11-05-2018T20:27:23,Bgrmystr2,"Very nice. :ok_hand: Congratulations, man"
11-05-2018T20:27:29,Bgrmystr2,that's really good
11-05-2018T20:27:36,Bgrmystr2,I hope it all goes well
11-05-2018T20:27:40,Dadrobit,"Intro to music theory, something I should've had done on my first semester, becoming the last class I need."
11-05-2018T20:28:11,Dadrobit,"Yeah, supposedly all of the music theory classes at my school are really intense, but I should be good."
11-05-2018T20:28:58,Dadrobit,They've gotten such a reputation that even my brother who was in EMS training and had nothing to do with audio heard horror stories about them lol.
11-05-2018T20:29:34,Dadrobit,And I'm taking it as a one month summer cram class. Gonna be fun.
11-05-2018T21:03:55,ItsActuallyKopyKat,heck yeah dude
11-05-2018T21:03:59,ItsActuallyKopyKat,cram classes are great fun
11-05-2018T21:52:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Sitting at home and I’m still dizzy
11-05-2018T21:53:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Probably going to bed early since it doesn’t look like Tom’s gonna be able to get on
11-05-2018T21:56:19,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Hope you feel better, kiwi"
11-05-2018T23:24:41,Trevuxnouxe,We went fishing and caught nothing. 🐟
11-05-2018T23:48:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Once I get food and sit for a minute I’m going back to sleep
11-05-2018T23:48:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe
