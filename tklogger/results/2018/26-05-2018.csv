26-05-2018T14:32:33,Bgrmystr2,there's no streams on mondays usually anyway
26-05-2018T14:32:44,Bgrmystr2,so the holiday is completely irrelevant
26-05-2018T15:23:11,Trevuxnouxe,"so, we went to a hockey game..... but we were early, really early."

26-05-2018T18:44:05,PalmettoPathfinder1,Anybody noticed that Twokinds is no longer in the top 5 comics on topwebcomics.com.  Last time I checked it was ranked #22
26-05-2018T19:43:10,Bgrmystr2,"nope, don't follow it"
26-05-2018T19:43:37,JamesBSquirrel3,Still Hoilday Break continues
26-05-2018T19:46:58,JamesBSquirrel3,"In the meantime; start plans on latest comic new page first then votes results as Colors - NOT really Color yet, just latest pages comic breif video ..."
26-05-2018T19:50:26,JamesBSquirrel3,"... then next video - same as Colors vote results but this time - main Full Color video as we are if ideas a Color Background! That's (my) suggestion to reply Twokinds Team, if they heard which way?"
26-05-2018T19:52:31,Bgrmystr2,"""team"" is just one person, and he's not even here. He's at a convention"
26-05-2018T19:52:52,Bgrmystr2,And he already knows what he's going to do
26-05-2018T19:52:58,Bgrmystr2,for the streams
26-05-2018T19:55:55,JamesBSquirrel3,"So now I decide to vote to Two Tigress Clan - (the unknown name [which who gonna call the idea name anyway?], but I do know next to her - is Iris). I like those Tigress ladies to give some!"
26-05-2018T19:57:20,JamesBSquirrel3,"Oh - it not as Team but who the person and the other, well you get heck the idea (or bad idea though)"
26-05-2018T19:58:37,JamesBSquirrel3,Just so you know if wasn't enough
26-05-2018T20:00:11,JamesBSquirrel3,"Anyway, now I'm out + back to bed + rest, I will eventually back soon(?), so long."
