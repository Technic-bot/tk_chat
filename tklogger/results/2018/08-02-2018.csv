08-02-2018T01:46:03,Bgrmystr2,so someone had to accept it
08-02-2018T01:46:19,Bgrmystr2,you can always manually set it to not do so
08-02-2018T01:46:48,Bgrmystr2,"update on your own time, when you go to sleep, or not update at all, just whatever have you"

08-02-2018T12:15:44,Bgrmystr2,why would you delete an email like that without reading it o.O

08-02-2018T12:33:56,Bgrmystr2,so nothing is auto-deleted
08-02-2018T12:34:02,Bgrmystr2,"so if it's not there, it wasn't sent."

08-02-2018T21:00:45,Misland,Hello
08-02-2018T21:00:46,Bespin,Nope lol

08-02-2018T21:01:15,Bgrmystr2,"xD gotta explore your world, bro"
08-02-2018T21:02:03,Bespin,I'm cool in my bubble
08-02-2018T21:02:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"the world, what a glorious place.  Seek freedom and it will lie stretched out  before your eyes"
08-02-2018T21:02:33,Bespin,Yea well does the world hold infinite fish sticks&gt;
08-02-2018T21:02:35,Bespin,?
08-02-2018T21:02:35,Bgrmystr2,"your bubble didn't contain the user list, Bespin."
08-02-2018T21:02:40,Bgrmystr2,"and technically, yes"
08-02-2018T21:02:44,Bespin,:eyes:
08-02-2018T21:02:47,Bgrmystr2,there's more fish sticks than you could eat in your life.
08-02-2018T21:02:52,Bgrmystr2,you just have to go and find them :P
08-02-2018T21:03:03,Bespin,I just added the user list to my bubble
08-02-2018T21:03:05,MetalAppleSauce,That's not what infinite means brg
08-02-2018T21:03:08,MetalAppleSauce,bgr*
08-02-2018T21:03:14,Bespin,now its upgraded
08-02-2018T21:03:16,Bgrmystr2,"Of course not, Metal"
08-02-2018T21:03:29,Bgrmystr2,but that's not exactly relevant in context
08-02-2018T21:03:29,RedDeath2018,ok
08-02-2018T21:03:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"if the endless dream guides your restless sprite, seize it. Raise your flag and stand tall"
08-02-2018T21:03:51,Bgrmystr2,"when you can keep finding something and never find the end of it your entire life, it will seem infinite."
08-02-2018T21:03:51,Unenlagia,And now I'm reminded of the Truly Immovable Rod
08-02-2018T21:04:09,Bespin,Tom left again i guess he didnt like my bubble not having the user list
08-02-2018T21:04:16,Bespin,oops
08-02-2018T21:04:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,he might be busy with stuff
08-02-2018T21:04:28,Bgrmystr2,Tom's probably busy setting up his computer
08-02-2018T21:04:38,Bgrmystr2,he usually restarts his pc before streaming if I recall correctly
08-02-2018T21:04:51,Bgrmystr2,and then sets up OBS and such
08-02-2018T21:05:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,for a more detailed explanation seek Bgr
08-02-2018T21:05:08,Bgrmystr2,"also, streaming on picarto doesn't require you to be in the chat either"
08-02-2018T21:05:10,RedDeath2018,XD

08-02-2018T21:06:45,wolfspartan1,brb
08-02-2018T21:06:58,Bgrmystr2,I can stream to Picarto straight from OBS and not have my browser open nor have the dashboard page open
08-02-2018T21:07:21,BadFoMo,"""He bravely ran away! He bravely ran away!"""
08-02-2018T21:07:45,wolfspartan1,back
08-02-2018T21:08:05,Bgrmystr2,the only reason you'd have your dashboard open really is to have the chat open and to use the different picarto settings
08-02-2018T21:10:52,Unenlagia,"It's a good idea to have it open, but not necessary."
08-02-2018T21:10:54,MefjuTK,What happend?

08-02-2018T21:41:42,Mustanglvr007,I'd say they stopped the updates for that model. Idk. How of is it??
08-02-2018T21:41:43,Rosscoe,rebooting fully doesnt help either
08-02-2018T21:42:09,UnknownEnd,I have access to so many emoji's

08-02-2018T21:42:26,Unenlagia,Have you tried support forums yet?
08-02-2018T21:42:27,Bgrmystr2,"you may need to reinstall, Ross"
08-02-2018T21:42:30,Bgrmystr2,"Well shit, Ron"
08-02-2018T21:42:46,Bgrmystr2,"cuz the 1080p shows up, but it only gives 720p video"

08-02-2018T21:42:58,Rosscoe,I did just reinstall
08-02-2018T21:43:10,Mustanglvr007,*4k uhd res intensifies*
08-02-2018T21:43:14,Rosscoe,Which I also mentioend in chat :laughing:
08-02-2018T21:43:15,JaydenMozingo,It's weird how under water the hair spreads out making Flora look fluffier
08-02-2018T21:43:18,Nekonny,loads fine for me here
08-02-2018T21:43:22,UnknownEnd,(¬¥ÔΩ•œâÔΩ•`)
08-02-2018T21:43:26,Nekonny,although it defaults to 720
08-02-2018T21:43:36,Ordithus,I get 1080
08-02-2018T21:43:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,1080p here
08-02-2018T21:44:04,Rosscoe,Could be an auto dection of screen size hes having maybe&gt;
08-02-2018T21:44:08,Bgrmystr2,"well it looks fine to me too, but I meant like, I have a video displayer that shows the actual video youtube displays"
08-02-2018T21:44:17,Bgrmystr2,and shows the resolution
08-02-2018T21:44:22,hyneria,"The music video looks really nice, Nekonny."
08-02-2018T21:44:29,Char89TheCharizard,So what's the point of a Nora Card?
08-02-2018T21:44:29,Mustanglvr007,I'm probably on 1080p
08-02-2018T21:44:31,Bgrmystr2,"and while youtube shows a 1080p option, it's still 720p"
08-02-2018T21:44:32,UnknownEnd,Is it weird that I basically read the comic in two days
08-02-2018T21:44:42,Mustanglvr007,No
08-02-2018T21:44:45,Tharkis,looked 1080p on my screen ah well
08-02-2018T21:44:52,Mustanglvr007,It's not weird
08-02-2018T21:44:52,Rosscoe,"You know, Im starting to ponder if this OBS error is windows 10 related"
08-02-2018T21:44:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"@Bgrmystr2 youtubes video compression sucks balls, that might be it"
08-02-2018T21:44:56,Char89TheCharizard,"Nope, its not weird"
08-02-2018T21:44:59,MuonNeutrino,@UnknownEnd not weird at all
08-02-2018T21:45:07,ZRO4825,Everything in Win10 is a problem Ross :P
08-02-2018T21:45:14,MuonNeutrino,i think a lot of us probably did when we first found it; i read it in one overnight
08-02-2018T21:45:20,Rosscoe,Sadly new laptop came with it stock
08-02-2018T21:45:23,UnknownEnd,Has anyone else?
08-02-2018T21:45:25,ZRO4825,"Okay, maybe not, but I'll keep poking fun at Win10 till I'm forced to use it, then I might, MIGHT admit it's okay-ish. :joy:"
08-02-2018T21:45:34,Mustanglvr007,"Ross, W10 is absolutely shit"
08-02-2018T21:45:37,NightMeaty22,i read it 3 times in a week is that weard
08-02-2018T21:45:40,Bgrmystr2,"unlikely, Marv, I've also tried video downloading sites and addons, none of which display the 1080p one"
08-02-2018T21:45:45,hyneria,Did you worked any more on that other animation? The one that looked like a Sailor Moon transformation.
08-02-2018T21:45:51,Bgrmystr2,they all say 720p is the highest res loaded
08-02-2018T21:45:55,Rosscoe,"My friend back in Ontario sadly got a pre built PC and it came with windows 10 stock, cant run any games on it past duke nukem 3d or it slows right to a crawl on all games FPS XD"
08-02-2018T21:46:00,Nekonny,hum
08-02-2018T21:46:00,SageSaga,Windows 10 is great
08-02-2018T21:46:04,Mustanglvr007,And that's coming from someone who's played every Forza game
08-02-2018T21:46:12,UnknownEnd,I actually read the comic like 10 hours a day
08-02-2018T21:46:13,TheWiseMankey,Wish I had Windows 10...
08-02-2018T21:46:15,Ordithus,Windows 10 is my best friend
08-02-2018T21:46:15,JaydenMozingo,Flora's got them curves.
08-02-2018T21:46:25,Ordithus,It knows everything about me!
08-02-2018T21:46:25,Bgrmystr2,"it's probably because his specs are going to be trash, Ross"
08-02-2018T21:46:31,Nekonny,"perhaps, should still be good on an anime with a lot of solid colors though"
08-02-2018T21:46:43,Nekonny,did anyone else have a problem with itt loading?
08-02-2018T21:46:49,Mustanglvr007,"@JaydenMozingo compared to Kat, no."
08-02-2018T21:46:51,Ordithus,"No trouble on my end, Ron"
08-02-2018T21:47:17,JaydenMozingo,Well Kat is the definition of curves but in this picture.
08-02-2018T21:47:19,ZRO4825,"No troubles with it loading, just was trying to get full 1080p out of it and youtube's being a butt about it, lol"
08-02-2018T21:47:28,Bgrmystr2,basically yeah
08-02-2018T21:47:33,Mustanglvr007,My experience with Windows 10 is that it's slow
08-02-2018T21:47:36,JaydenMozingo,In this picture she still has some nice curves
08-02-2018T21:47:36,Bgrmystr2,it says 1080p and loads 720p
08-02-2018T21:47:50,Ordithus,"If it was just uploaded, it might take some time to ""distribute"", I wonder?"
08-02-2018T21:47:51,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: Guess I can just chalk it up to youtube's loading algorithm being a dumb as usual.
08-02-2018T21:47:57,SageSaga,your experience is not fact
08-02-2018T21:48:00,Char89TheCharizard,"well love to stay and chat, but I got an anime to watch so bye"
08-02-2018T21:48:08,Bgrmystr2,seeya Char

08-02-2018T21:48:22,Sammit,Bye Char
08-02-2018T21:48:22,Ordithus,"Hmm, no clue then"
08-02-2018T21:48:23,Nekonny,but just switched it to public today
08-02-2018T21:48:29,Rosscoe,Think I might have figured it out guys....theres a real time protection system on windows 10 to stop apps from making stuff. lets see if this is it XD
08-02-2018T21:48:31,CrimsonHelsing,^^
08-02-2018T21:48:42,CrimsonHelsing,"Hey guys, wassup?"
08-02-2018T21:48:45,ZRO4825,"It might just be Youtube being a butt to me and Bgr. We'll figure it out later, lol"

08-02-2018T21:50:12,Bgrmystr2,you probably need decent set of hardware for windows 10
08-02-2018T21:50:17,SageSaga,probably
08-02-2018T21:50:31,unsteddyphoenix,im glad we solved this mystery
08-02-2018T21:50:31,hyneria,My laptop runs better with win 10 than with win 7
08-02-2018T21:50:39,Bgrmystr2,Doesn't windows 10 have higher requirements for it's OS than 7 does?
08-02-2018T21:50:46,SageSaga,yep
08-02-2018T21:50:54,Unenlagia,Win10 is working fine for me. Are you sure it's not a hardware issue you're having?
08-02-2018T21:52:12,TheWiseMankey,"That reminds me, you plan on getting BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle, Phil?"

08-02-2018T21:53:44,TheWiseMankey,And she is DAMN sexy.

08-02-2018T21:54:01,SageSaga,honestly i think Mihari and I are both struggling with not getting it just because we like her
08-02-2018T21:54:02,Rosscoe,According to the box for my new Ink jet printer windows xp requirements are pentium I with 256 megs of ram
08-02-2018T21:54:03,ZRO4825,"Seriously, HALF of the damned MAIN team from RWBY is going to be DLC....wtf"
08-02-2018T21:54:13,thestooge,LOVING the background so far Tom!
08-02-2018T21:54:26,TheWiseMankey,Well that is true...it's an outrage that Blake and Yang are DLC.
08-02-2018T21:54:27,Rosscoe,"windows 7 intel II, windows 10 Intel with minimal 2.6ghz and a gig of ram XD"
08-02-2018T21:54:31,UnknownEnd,wishes he was on a computer
08-02-2018T21:54:33,TheWiseMankey,BUT. At least they're FREELC.
08-02-2018T21:54:55,ZRO4825,"Are they? Because last I'd heard was just DLC. And with ARC-Sys, DLC tends to = $$"
08-02-2018T21:55:07,TheWiseMankey,They announced Blake and Yang are for free.
08-02-2018T21:55:24,Unenlagia,Probably not any characters after that
08-02-2018T21:55:38,Bgrmystr2,"This is nice, sage"
08-02-2018T21:55:39,ZRO4825,"Okay, that makes it a bit better then."

08-02-2018T22:43:22,Ordithus,The only way it would spin is if they messed up
08-02-2018T22:43:49,Bgrmystr2,"wasn't fluent. Jeez, it's like you didn't even read what you typed before sending it. :P"

08-02-2018T22:57:52,WinterSage,that squirrel looks confused

08-02-2018T22:58:20,Ordithus,Quite
08-02-2018T22:58:41,Bgrmystr2,"agree w/ Unen. Rocket science is cool by default, so it wasn't needed to be said"

08-02-2018T23:01:01,Unenlagia,Real life is often stranger than fiction.
08-02-2018T23:01:11,Bgrmystr2,that was a good movie

08-02-2018T23:02:12,Unenlagia,Yeah I can see that in the marketing material
08-02-2018T23:02:18,unsteddyphoenix,So how long until Elon Musk builds a death laser and tries to take over the world?
08-02-2018T23:02:31,Bgrmystr2,doesn't need a death laser
08-02-2018T23:02:40,Bgrmystr2,just get a bigass metal plate
08-02-2018T23:02:44,MuonNeutrino,why would he want *this* world? he's after mars ^^
08-02-2018T23:02:48,unsteddyphoenix,He also didnt need to send a car to space whats your point?
08-02-2018T23:02:49,Bgrmystr2,and hover it over a country
08-02-2018T23:02:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,and block the sun
08-02-2018T23:03:11,Bgrmystr2,"lol marv, naw. Don't need to block the sun."
08-02-2018T23:03:14,Bgrmystr2,Just demand X
08-02-2018T23:03:22,unsteddyphoenix,chemical x?
08-02-2018T23:03:23,Bgrmystr2,"and if he doesn't get X, drop the plate from space."

08-02-2018T23:03:42,Unenlagia,"Don't need a plate, tungsten rods"

08-02-2018T23:03:50,Nocturno,The detail on the water tho :ok_hand:
08-02-2018T23:03:53,Bgrmystr2,"That may as well be a plate, Unen"
08-02-2018T23:04:03,RaumTheCrowDemon,he could just make a bomb 100 times more powerful than the tsara bomba
08-02-2018T23:04:15,unsteddyphoenix,same
08-02-2018T23:04:19,Unenlagia,But a dropsat can be used multiple times
08-02-2018T23:04:20,RaumTheCrowDemon,then it wouls be us vs russians vs musk
08-02-2018T23:04:28,RaumTheCrowDemon,XD
08-02-2018T23:04:32,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah it's called making a physical object and letting it impact the ground, Raum."
08-02-2018T23:04:36,Unenlagia,And reloaded.
08-02-2018T23:04:46,RaumTheCrowDemon,not making sense
08-02-2018T23:05:08,Unenlagia,Google rods from god
08-02-2018T23:05:13,Whitestripes,How would you drop a plate from space?
08-02-2018T23:05:18,RaumTheCrowDemon,not sure how he's get a metal plate as big as the earth
08-02-2018T23:05:22,Whitestripes,Do you put engines on the plate?
08-02-2018T23:05:35,Bgrmystr2,"Are you trying to destroy a country or wipe out humanity, White?"
08-02-2018T23:05:36,Ordithus,"Dropping a kinetic weapon with the energy of an atomic bomb, requires a rocket with the energy of an atomic bomb."
08-02-2018T23:05:55,Whitestripes,Maybe both üòÖ
08-02-2018T23:05:59,Bgrmystr2,then yes.
08-02-2018T23:06:01,RaumTheCrowDemon,false
08-02-2018T23:06:02,Bgrmystr2,Put engines
08-02-2018T23:06:06,RaumTheCrowDemon,it would require more energy
08-02-2018T23:06:16,Ordithus,"True as well, Raum."
08-02-2018T23:06:22,Bgrmystr2,also gravity is how you get stuff back to earth. No rockets needed :P
08-02-2018T23:06:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,put a engine in a sword then launch it from space
08-02-2018T23:06:26,RaumTheCrowDemon,exponentially more
08-02-2018T23:06:36,WinterSage,i'm tired. i get stupid when i'm tired. please. this hurts me
08-02-2018T23:06:42,Ordithus,"Not from orbit, bgr!  Orbit just kinda, stays."
08-02-2018T23:06:46,aeoronwah,"Marv, this sounds like some gundam shit"
08-02-2018T23:06:51,RaumTheCrowDemon,"eg, his rocket has a payload of a ford F-350"
08-02-2018T23:06:54,Whitestripes,"Unless its outside the atmosphere in zero gravity, then it should just rotate around the earth"
08-02-2018T23:07:22,Bgrmystr2,"Well yeah you need to get it into gravity to fall, but from there, no rocket needed"
08-02-2018T23:07:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Aeoron the sword bit is from final fantasy
08-02-2018T23:07:37,JaydenMozingo,Dang Tom. The water effects man. They're amazing.
08-02-2018T23:07:47,Bgrmystr2,"Winter, Rocket science is not difficult. :V"
08-02-2018T23:07:48,SageSaga,i say launch a bunch of fire works into space and have them in a box that will set them off when their orbit decays enough for them to drop into the atmosphere
08-02-2018T23:07:50,Ordithus,"You have to actively de-orbit the object, which itself requires a lot of energy."
08-02-2018T23:08:01,SageSaga,so at some point somewhere theres an awesome fireworks display
08-02-2018T23:08:02,RaumTheCrowDemon,70 tons
08-02-2018T23:08:09,Nekonny,not enough oxegen for a explosion
08-02-2018T23:08:15,Whitestripes,I like how we are all coming up with tomorrows tools of mass destruction
08-02-2018T23:08:24,Ordithus,More like debunking them :P
08-02-2018T23:08:28,JaydenMozingo,Yeah! XD
08-02-2018T23:08:36,Bgrmystr2,"not even remotely debunking, since it's very possible Ord"
08-02-2018T23:08:37,Nekonny,of the kind you would expect from fireworks
08-02-2018T23:08:38,RaumTheCrowDemon,he made falcon heavy for other companies wanting to launch large satellites
08-02-2018T23:08:43,Unenlagia,Which is why the entire concept has been scrapped as being impractical and overly costly.
08-02-2018T23:08:50,Dinoman515,"Walks in, waving to everyone."
08-02-2018T23:08:51,WinterSage,'s brain hurts from the excessive use of scientific concepts
08-02-2018T23:08:55,Ordithus,Hi Dino
08-02-2018T23:08:55,Bgrmystr2,hey Dino
08-02-2018T23:09:02,Unenlagia,Conventional explosives work just as well.
08-02-2018T23:09:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Dino
08-02-2018T23:09:06,JaydenMozingo,Hello Dino
08-02-2018T23:09:10,RaumTheCrowDemon,not ocnventional
08-02-2018T23:09:13,RaumTheCrowDemon,atomic
08-02-2018T23:09:18,RaumTheCrowDemon,nuclear
08-02-2018T23:09:22,Nekonny,"""tomorrows tools of mass destruction"" ?"
08-02-2018T23:09:23,Dinoman515,"Wow... i walk in... to see that. I'm astonished, as usual."
08-02-2018T23:09:23,SageSaga,then make them magnesium based
08-02-2018T23:09:25,Nekonny,how so?
08-02-2018T23:09:32,SageSaga,they provide their own oxygen
08-02-2018T23:09:40,Bgrmystr2,"lol, sage has the right idea"
08-02-2018T23:09:44,Whitestripes,Because no one has really tried these things
08-02-2018T23:09:48,Ordithus,"Sage, magnesium requires oxygen to do its thing"
08-02-2018T23:10:01,Ordithus,What you're watching is a very rapid oxidation
08-02-2018T23:10:03,RaumTheCrowDemon,magnesium does not provide oxygen
08-02-2018T23:10:08,RaumTheCrowDemon,it reacts with oxygen
08-02-2018T23:10:25,RaumTheCrowDemon,only when triggered with a high temperature
08-02-2018T23:10:26,SageSaga,what was the compound that lets off its own oxygen?
08-02-2018T23:10:36,RaumTheCrowDemon,"idk, rocket fuel"
08-02-2018T23:10:42,RaumTheCrowDemon,sugar
08-02-2018T23:10:46,RaumTheCrowDemon,tnt
08-02-2018T23:10:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,spice
08-02-2018T23:10:51,RaumTheCrowDemon,gunpowder
08-02-2018T23:10:53,Ordithus,I think high explosives usually self-oxidize
08-02-2018T23:10:55,Dinoman515,All of the spice.
08-02-2018T23:11:06,Unenlagia,The spice must flow.
08-02-2018T23:11:11,RaumTheCrowDemon,"by self oxidize, do you mean not requiring an atmosphere containing oxygen?"
08-02-2018T23:11:16,Ordithus,Yes
08-02-2018T23:11:27,Ordithus,They have oxygen in them
08-02-2018T23:11:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,why was Professor Utonium trying to make little girls :thinking:
08-02-2018T23:11:47,RaumTheCrowDemon,"yes, an oxygen dependant reaction would require air pressure or a mixture of sorts like gunpowder"
08-02-2018T23:12:15,RaumTheCrowDemon,"gunpowder contains potassium nitrate, an oxidizer"
08-02-2018T23:12:24,RaumTheCrowDemon,KNO3
08-02-2018T23:12:30,SageSaga,also if fireworks went off too high anyways no one would see them- so i would have them set to go off once they reached an altitude where there was oxygen enough for the reaction
08-02-2018T23:12:42,RaumTheCrowDemon,fireworks?
08-02-2018T23:12:56,RaumTheCrowDemon,pretty sure fireworks are not atmospherically oxygen dependant
08-02-2018T23:12:57,Dinoman515,"Now this, is SCIENCE."
08-02-2018T23:12:57,Nekonny,how would you know how far they were from the ground?
08-02-2018T23:13:04,SageSaga,science
08-02-2018T23:13:06,Nekonny,and they would have to fall over populated areas
08-02-2018T23:13:10,Ordithus,Sage prefers peaceful displays of awesome
08-02-2018T23:13:24,SageSaga,they wouldnt have to
08-02-2018T23:13:36,Whitestripes,"Don't fireworks use gunpowder, as Raum stated, was an oxidizer?"
08-02-2018T23:13:50,aeoronwah,Have a barometer as well a a laser rangefinder?
08-02-2018T23:13:53,WinterSage,"no more science. science was my strongest subject in school, and i enjoyed showing off, but this. this hurts me. you guys are going to kill me"
08-02-2018T23:14:00,RaumTheCrowDemon,"fireworks are typically not launcher above a certain altitude because the further up the larger the payload would need to be for it to have the same perspective of massiveness, otherwise it just costs a hell of a lot more"
08-02-2018T23:14:03,ZRO4825,Why would you NOT prefer peaceful displays of awesome? They're so much easier on everyone than non-peaceful displays of whatever. ^_^
08-02-2018T23:14:18,SageSaga,these would be coming down though Raum
08-02-2018T23:14:23,WinterSage,i'm so tired...
08-02-2018T23:14:27,Dinoman515,"Rest in Peace, @WinterSage."
08-02-2018T23:14:29,SageSaga,go to sleep then
08-02-2018T23:14:44,Nekonny,you could just drop fireworks from a helicopter if that were the case
08-02-2018T23:14:51,Nekonny,or from a dronw
08-02-2018T23:14:54,WinterSage,but... must..... watch.... one... more... episode... of... Star Wars AHAHHAHHA HELP ME
08-02-2018T23:15:01,RaumTheCrowDemon,"what do you mean coming down, like it was already triggered at a high altitude, with no regard to being launched to that altitude?"
08-02-2018T23:15:05,Whitestripes,"Oh, what star wars show?"
08-02-2018T23:15:06,Mapleday,Is WinterSage the February form for SageSaga?
08-02-2018T23:15:22,Unenlagia,"It's time to stop, Winter."
08-02-2018T23:15:29,Dinoman515,Only 91 Users?! What is this?!
08-02-2018T23:15:31,RaumTheCrowDemon,drones and helicopters do not go near the height of puclicly displayed fireworks
08-02-2018T23:15:31,SageSaga,we are talking about dropping fireworks from space
08-02-2018T23:15:57,RaumTheCrowDemon,dropped as in propelled
08-02-2018T23:16:01,Whitestripes,"Im in a drone piloting class, I think i'm going to be a drone pilot as a career"
08-02-2018T23:16:08,Mapleday,By the metric ton? Only if we can use taxpayer dollars.
08-02-2018T23:16:20,RaumTheCrowDemon,drones do not fly high enough..
08-02-2018T23:16:24,WinterSage,dropping fireworks from space. what altitude we talking about. depending on the altitude it'd just end up being in orbit for several hundred years and it won't matter anymore
08-02-2018T23:16:24,SageSaga,dropped as in their orbit would decay and they would re-enter the atmosphere
08-02-2018T23:16:26,Nekonny,a decelerated re-entry would not require a heat shield
08-02-2018T23:16:39,RaumTheCrowDemon,and if we are talking about air pressure being at a minimum you wouldnt be able to fly an electric or jet drone
08-02-2018T23:17:03,RaumTheCrowDemon,"it wouldnt be dropped from space, but rather propelled"
08-02-2018T23:17:08,Dinoman515,"Make America go further in debt by wasting $5,000,000,000 on fireworks that are being sent to space...."
08-02-2018T23:17:21,RaumTheCrowDemon,ensuring a proper timing for its decension
08-02-2018T23:17:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,sounds fun
08-02-2018T23:17:23,Unenlagia,I think we've lost the plot here.
08-02-2018T23:17:24,ZRO4825,I know a much better subject to be talking about than this one.
08-02-2018T23:17:36,Nekonny,You have to spend money to make money
08-02-2018T23:17:37,SageSaga,This would be privately funded!
08-02-2018T23:17:42,TheWiseMankey,Well why not. I already saw thousands of dollars of pyrotechnics wasted on Roman Reigns at least year's Wrestlemania...
08-02-2018T23:17:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,@ZRO4825 supra's?
08-02-2018T23:17:52,Ordithus,"Sattelites in low orbit decay and come back down within years.  Usually in a fireball, which is convenient for Sage's desires."
08-02-2018T23:17:54,RaumTheCrowDemon,"he is making a hypothetical conversation, for you to take it seriously is like thinking hitler is going to come back and hold your grandma ransom"
08-02-2018T23:17:54,Mapleday,And you could set them to go off at a given altitude on reentry.
08-02-2018T23:17:56,eric190,"if you want it sub-orbital, just take the nukes off an ICBM, replace the nuke with regular fireworks, and launch as usual."
08-02-2018T23:17:56,ZRO4825,"Close, but not quite!"
08-02-2018T23:18:00,ZRO4825,Blue's boobs! =D

08-02-2018T23:18:32,eric190,problem with using a nuke though: EMP fries everything.

08-02-2018T23:18:54,ZRO4825,"Yeah, it's only~"
08-02-2018T23:18:56,Whitestripes,Its only 8:18 for me

08-02-2018T23:20:00,Nekonny,there you go
08-02-2018T23:20:02,RaumTheCrowDemon,people dont realise that actually funding these space experiments for research puts us ahead educatively and militarily to other countries
08-02-2018T23:20:16,aeoronwah,Eastern time zone is best time zone @ZRO4825

08-02-2018T23:20:31,Bgrmystr2,But we don't care about that Raum. We just want to see big pretty explosions
08-02-2018T23:20:33,Whitestripes,Is educatively a word?
08-02-2018T23:20:43,Bgrmystr2,"Don't think so, White."
08-02-2018T23:20:48,JaydenMozingo,"God @Twokinds , I wish I could get lessons from you on how to add so much detail  XD"
08-02-2018T23:20:52,unsteddyphoenix,educatacious
08-02-2018T23:20:54,RaumTheCrowDemon,educatively  is an adverb
08-02-2018T23:20:54,TheWiseMankey,"Man, if only Nami and Kaylin were in this pic, too..."
08-02-2018T23:21:06,SageSaga,Nami is

08-02-2018T23:21:15,JaydenMozingo,I'm not very good on detail
08-02-2018T23:21:20,WinterSage,"mmmkay. well considering every possible variable, i don't even think a firework would act normally at such a  high altitude. or we controlling when the firework is set off, or letting it explode on its own?"
08-02-2018T23:21:29,ZRO4825,Bamboozled by the Nami with cat ears!
08-02-2018T23:21:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"@JaydenMozingo its just takes some time, practice makes perfect"

08-02-2018T23:21:46,Whitestripes,"Well, how big would the firework be anyway?"

08-02-2018T23:21:52,BluePhantom90,looking nice Tom
08-02-2018T23:21:53,Bgrmystr2,Huh. It's a word. I've never heard of it. :/
08-02-2018T23:21:54,RaumTheCrowDemon,"""every possible variable"" hasnt even listed one"
08-02-2018T23:21:54,CrRAR,yuuuge

08-02-2018T23:21:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Snow
08-02-2018T23:21:57,Bgrmystr2,Heya Snow
08-02-2018T23:22:10,SageSaga,no split tail
08-02-2018T23:22:17,WinterSage,most variables
08-02-2018T23:22:19,MrAMP,"When in doubt, reasons are the best. xd"
08-02-2018T23:22:24,RaumTheCrowDemon,like a b and c?
08-02-2018T23:22:24,TheWiseMankey,"RIGHT, I forgot she has that split tail."
08-02-2018T23:22:33,TheWiseMankey,"In that case, why aren't Blue and Nami making out?"
08-02-2018T23:22:36,SNOWDON,So this is where the other katbox artists are hiding
08-02-2018T23:22:38,RaumTheCrowDemon,did you plot these variables on your graphics calculator even?
08-02-2018T23:22:45,JaydenMozingo,"With as much as I would like to follow that advice, I can't, as I never have any time to practice."
08-02-2018T23:23:13,WinterSage,"to name a couple of the more important ones, lack of oxygen, the fact that anything entering our atmosphere catches fire anyway"
08-02-2018T23:23:33,RaumTheCrowDemon,false and false
08-02-2018T23:23:33,SageSaga,yeah- use that fire to ignight it
08-02-2018T23:23:38,RaumTheCrowDemon,we already went over this
08-02-2018T23:23:47,RaumTheCrowDemon,gunpowder in fireworks supplies its own oxygen
08-02-2018T23:23:48,SageSaga,ignite*
08-02-2018T23:24:03,RaumTheCrowDemon,"objects catching fire on reentry are due to the objects slowing down, not speeding up"
08-02-2018T23:24:14,Ordithus,The hard part is keeping it from going boom too early!  At least it's fireworks either way
08-02-2018T23:24:18,WinterSage,you guys went over this when i was half asleep :/ still not fully awake but awake enough to think about something such as this
08-02-2018T23:24:21,unsteddyphoenix,It's like he's not even using his graphing calculator at ALL :/
08-02-2018T23:24:32,RaumTheCrowDemon,^
08-02-2018T23:24:42,RaumTheCrowDemon,no graphing calculator no science
08-02-2018T23:24:44,CrRAR,what a rebel
08-02-2018T23:24:52,SageSaga,the point is- anything that prevents it from working- can be fixed to make it work
08-02-2018T23:24:53,unsteddyphoenix,Thats just common sense
08-02-2018T23:24:58,ZRO4825,I think ya'll thinking too much 'bout this.
08-02-2018T23:25:10,Bgrmystr2,"that's the whole point of the subject, Zro"
08-02-2018T23:25:12,Whitestripes,Probably
08-02-2018T23:25:12,Bgrmystr2,to think too much about it
08-02-2018T23:25:26,WinterSage,i suppose sage is correct
08-02-2018T23:25:27,SNOWDON,I feel as tho I'm missing context
08-02-2018T23:25:29,Whitestripes,Better to think too much than not to think
08-02-2018T23:25:35,ZRO4825,This is an art stream. Hypothetical fireworks theoretically exploding in a potential future endeavor are not art!
08-02-2018T23:25:39,RaumTheCrowDemon,"well things catch fire on reentry because the density of the oxygen in our atmosphere is causing so much friction on the object enetering at it's space speed, much higher than terminal velocity"
08-02-2018T23:25:43,Ordithus,"Rockets and space.  And boom, Snow."
08-02-2018T23:25:47,Bgrmystr2,"Technically.. I would call fireworks art, Zro"
08-02-2018T23:25:47,SageSaga,Zro
08-02-2018T23:25:52,SageSaga,i want you to re-read that
08-02-2018T23:25:59,unsteddyphoenix,If he drew fireworks would you allow it then Zro?
08-02-2018T23:26:00,SageSaga,you are saying fireworks cant be art
08-02-2018T23:26:07,ZRO4825,I'm well aware of what I said. :P
08-02-2018T23:26:18,SageSaga,take it back then!
08-02-2018T23:26:19,RaumTheCrowDemon,he is also saying that a creative concept about fireworks is not art
08-02-2018T23:26:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,explosions are the best art
08-02-2018T23:26:26,Ordithus,^
08-02-2018T23:26:30,ZRO4825,"I would take it back, had I meant it in any sort of seriousness. ^_^"
08-02-2018T23:26:34,Tharkis,"fireworks company up where my dad lives sometimes does demo shows when they prep for competitions, they're real cool"
08-02-2018T23:26:44,Bgrmystr2,"lol Raum, Concept art is still art :V"
08-02-2018T23:26:50,RaumTheCrowDemon,do they launch them like mortars?

08-02-2018T23:27:36,Tharkis,"they do all sorts of stuff.  everything from stadium pyro and concert pyro and sprots events, to 4th of july stuffs"
08-02-2018T23:27:38,RaumTheCrowDemon,we didnt in the first place

08-02-2018T23:30:11,WinterSage,i refused to do any work because they refused to put me in a faster paced class

08-02-2018T23:32:47,Tharkis,i worked my butt off because i was bored stiff in my school.

08-02-2018T23:36:51,RaumTheCrowDemon,"dude, you literally said fireworks wouldnt explode in space, and that reentry fire would occur on low orbit launched objects"
08-02-2018T23:36:54,Ordithus,Kids also don't know shit about what they need to learn.
08-02-2018T23:37:04,aeoronwah,"For any math or sience based career you will need a degree, just a heads up WinterSage"
08-02-2018T23:37:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Fog play
08-02-2018T23:37:16,RaumTheCrowDemon,teachers are 95% optional
08-02-2018T23:37:25,ZRO4825,.....wut?
08-02-2018T23:37:27,RaumTheCrowDemon,anyone can learn to a college level without any human interaction
08-02-2018T23:37:33,ZRO4825,Bullshit.
08-02-2018T23:37:41,ZRO4825,Absolute bullshit.
08-02-2018T23:37:41,Ordithus,^
08-02-2018T23:37:48,Whitestripes,^
08-02-2018T23:37:49,Tharkis,"you gota be dedicated and motivated.  You CAN, but it's a lot faster with an instructor =)"
08-02-2018T23:37:51,WinterSage,"no, i firework will not explode in space. it may explode upon reentering Earth's atmosphere, but no in space"
08-02-2018T23:37:53,SageSaga,yeeeeeah human interaction is very important for education
08-02-2018T23:37:54,RaumTheCrowDemon,"maybe for you, because you are unmotivated and have never applied yourself without some sort of guidelines or enforcement"
08-02-2018T23:38:06,SageSaga,we never said fireworks exploding in space
08-02-2018T23:38:12,unsteddyphoenix,Thats accurate yeah
08-02-2018T23:38:12,SageSaga,see conversational skills might help
08-02-2018T23:38:15,ZRO4825,"I have applied myself on MANY occasions, and I'll thank you kindly to not make farfetched assumptions about anything to dow ith me, TYVM."
08-02-2018T23:38:19,RaumTheCrowDemon,"eg, you can become self taught in almost anything"
08-02-2018T23:38:21,JaydenMozingo,Looking amazing Tom!
08-02-2018T23:38:28,Nocturno,I think social interaction should be a subject
08-02-2018T23:38:32,unsteddyphoenix,Does the ability to read come under conversational skill? :thinking:
08-02-2018T23:38:42,WinterSage,"ye, socialization is not my strongsuit either :/"
08-02-2018T23:38:43,RaumTheCrowDemon,"to say you cant without someone holding your hand, is, indeed, bullshit"
08-02-2018T23:38:47,ZRO4825,"But simply put, without interactions with others, you have nothing to LEARN, because there is no one to place any information for you to learn FROM."
08-02-2018T23:38:49,Mihari,"Okay folks, that's enough."
08-02-2018T23:38:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"Beautiful shadows, fog, and color work!"
08-02-2018T23:38:57,Tharkis,"in the modern day and age... i would say yes, reading comprehension is a vital communication skill"
08-02-2018T23:38:58,unsteddyphoenix,Nah I need my hand held 100%
08-02-2018T23:39:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Adult is needed
08-02-2018T23:39:18,WinterSage,reading comprehention you said?
08-02-2018T23:39:25,RaumTheCrowDemon,you are mistaking the verbal day to day interactiong from a school setting with the required transfer of knowledge through other mediums
08-02-2018T23:39:26,Mihari,"I said, that's enough."
08-02-2018T23:39:27,Whitestripes,"Well, some people need an instructor"
08-02-2018T23:39:39,Bgrmystr2,I'm just gonna sit here and look at the pretty flora.

08-02-2018T23:40:39,aeoronwah,What types of swords are you making Tharkis?
08-02-2018T23:41:05,Tharkis,with permission from streamers i can link a photo of some swords in progress that iv'e made.
08-02-2018T23:41:09,RaumTheCrowDemon,"anyways, my report was about how the educative system could be streamlined through technical advancements and complicated environments of online tutoring where one teacher can teach thousands of students at a time using an online work book"
08-02-2018T23:41:20,Tharkis,since if i say oakshott type 15 and type 18b swords no one will know what that is =D
