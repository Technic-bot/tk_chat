13-12-2018T00:10:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Find yourself a book Tom?
13-12-2018T00:10:55,Twokinds,no
13-12-2018T00:15:40,RimaDraws,you could try the hunger games. my sister loved it and im starting to read it
13-12-2018T00:17:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Have you tried filtering through the availables?
13-12-2018T00:18:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Or would you be interested in something that makes you want to toss the book in a volcano? Or rewind time so your heart doesn’t get run over by a semi?
13-12-2018T00:32:08,Dadrobit,I hear Harry Potter was pretty decent.
13-12-2018T00:43:07,unsteddyphoenix,Never heard of it. Is that some kind of indie book?
13-12-2018T00:48:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Never read it
13-12-2018T00:49:26,Twokinds,I have already read the hunger games
13-12-2018T00:50:49,unsteddyphoenix,Did you cheer for Gale or Peeta
13-12-2018T00:54:55,Twokinds,...
13-12-2018T00:55:19,Twokinds,I don't remember which is which.
13-12-2018T00:56:13,unsteddyphoenix,Peeta is the bread one
13-12-2018T00:56:25,unsteddyphoenix,'cause like. Peeta. Bread. Pita bread.
13-12-2018T00:56:28,unsteddyphoenix,It's very clever.
13-12-2018T00:56:29,Twokinds,Aaah
13-12-2018T00:56:32,Twokinds,It makes sense
13-12-2018T00:56:55,unsteddyphoenix,Those books were extremely ok
13-12-2018T00:57:02,Twokinds,"And gale, because he can make tornadoes"
13-12-2018T00:57:17,unsteddyphoenix,Yup!
13-12-2018T00:57:39,unsteddyphoenix,Those tornado powers really came in handy in that story
13-12-2018T00:57:45,Twokinds,It's too bad he never uses those powers in the book. I'm sure it would have come in han
13-12-2018T00:57:50,Twokinds,You steal my joke
13-12-2018T00:58:19,unsteddyphoenix,Whoops~
13-12-2018T00:58:26,unsteddyphoenix,"There, please continue"
13-12-2018T00:58:30,unsteddyphoenix,:D
13-12-2018T00:59:21,Twokinds,As I was saying... uh...
13-12-2018T00:59:25,Twokinds,Gale really blows
13-12-2018T01:00:08,Twokinds,Oops
13-12-2018T01:00:10,Twokinds,"1am, time for bed"
13-12-2018T01:00:14,unsteddyphoenix,Wow.
13-12-2018T01:00:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Both are cool but both kinda are eh
13-12-2018T01:00:19,unsteddyphoenix,Im blown away
13-12-2018T01:00:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Night Tom
13-12-2018T01:00:22,iliar,"Good night, Tom."
13-12-2018T01:00:27,Twokinds,Alexa says so
13-12-2018T01:00:33,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-RainezZz:
13-12-2018T01:00:38,unsteddyphoenix,All hail our robot overlords
13-12-2018T01:00:44,unsteddyphoenix,"Toms storming out, good night."
13-12-2018T01:00:45,SpazztasticKiwi,What a shame
13-12-2018T01:00:59,SpazztasticKiwi,And we were just restarting a conversation
13-12-2018T01:01:06,unsteddyphoenix,Also nohomo but Gale was way hotter in those books she chose wrong
13-12-2018T01:01:42,SpazztasticKiwi,She was in love with Gale but ended up falling deeper for him later on
13-12-2018T01:01:43,Twokinds,I rarely find love triangles very compelling
13-12-2018T01:01:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Unfortunately
13-12-2018T01:02:14,unsteddyphoenix,"I cant think of a...""good"" love triangle"
13-12-2018T01:02:29,unsteddyphoenix,They mostly seem to be reserved for terrible daytime television
13-12-2018T01:02:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Spending time with Peeta got her to fall in love with him and that’s how she ended up
13-12-2018T01:03:13,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds extremely fickle when you put it that way lol
13-12-2018T01:03:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Poison princess is out for you to try then. Triangle there
13-12-2018T01:03:14,Bgrmystr2,rofl tom and phoenix get +1s
13-12-2018T01:03:24,Bgrmystr2,I lost.
13-12-2018T01:04:01,iliar,The three sides in the figure is very small. And so you created Raine's harem.
13-12-2018T01:04:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you look at it, that triangle is fickle"
13-12-2018T01:04:27,unsteddyphoenix,haha
13-12-2018T01:04:42,unsteddyphoenix,"triangles are out, harems are in"
13-12-2018T01:04:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"With Peeta in the ring, she’s connected to him - helping and accepting his support"
13-12-2018T01:05:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"And then when she’s with Gale, it’s the same, especially when he gets his back sliced up"
13-12-2018T01:06:36,unsteddyphoenix,"I guess love triangles are fickle, by definition."
13-12-2018T01:06:52,unsteddyphoenix,Since at least one of them is constantly switching affections
13-12-2018T01:07:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"With The Luner Cronicles, you get different couples in a dystopian world with references to classic storylines like Cinderella (first book is “Cinder”) that all intertwine"
13-12-2018T01:08:31,Twokinds,Need one that just ends with all three together
13-12-2018T01:09:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"Despite the triangle in Poison Princess, I like it. But it’s because of the dystopian aspect and intwining of some tarot lore"
13-12-2018T01:09:02,unsteddyphoenix,The lewdest timeline
13-12-2018T01:09:25,SpazztasticKiwi,PP does have a 3-way relationship with it with the Sun card gets introduced but
13-12-2018T01:09:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Do you really want to jump into that void?
13-12-2018T01:10:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"And besides Cinder, Eve has no triangle that I remember"
13-12-2018T01:13:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Now Just Listen is a gooood book
13-12-2018T01:13:23,SpazztasticKiwi,A sort of fuzzy feeling book
13-12-2018T01:15:13,SpazztasticKiwi,But I’ll stop. Mainly cause I’ve spouted about PP before and need to slow the roll unless someone actually wants the author so they can read it - or any of the others really
13-12-2018T06:50:24,RimaDraws,I have the lunar chronicles

13-12-2018T08:17:33,MrMongMong,But that technically isn't canon.
13-12-2018T08:53:44,CrimsonQuill,Hullo MrMongMong
13-12-2018T08:53:54,CrimsonQuill,I don't go for love triangles.
13-12-2018T08:54:30,CrimsonQuill,They're a bit weird.
13-12-2018T08:54:52,TerraTheWizard,best love triangle is mike & evals
13-12-2018T08:55:08,CrimsonQuill,That's not a triangle though.

13-12-2018T11:34:13,Twokinds,Oh no my exams!
13-12-2018T11:38:38,MrMongMong,"Exams. I wish you luck. Also, Mike and Evals is a love triangle, albeit one in which all three members are not present at the same time."
13-12-2018T11:39:00,MrMongMong,Possibly even a love square if Evals' form is considered.
13-12-2018T11:40:22,Azumachan,Morning coffee.
13-12-2018T11:40:28,MrMongMong,"Love triangles are weird, they are more like love angles if done normally."
13-12-2018T11:40:41,MrMongMong,Coffee will one day be your downfall sir.

13-12-2018T12:17:02,Twokinds,heheh
13-12-2018T12:17:10,Twokinds,We've got squirrels all over our backyard
13-12-2018T12:17:48,CrimsonQuill,Lucky you.
13-12-2018T12:17:56,CrimsonQuill,"In our backyard, we have thrushes."
13-12-2018T12:18:02,CrimsonQuill,With the occasional buzzard.
13-12-2018T12:18:39,SpazztasticKiwi,We got em too
13-12-2018T12:18:40,Azumachan,That's nuts.
13-12-2018T12:18:40,Twokinds,"lol it's funny that if they were rats I'd be a little perturbed, but because they're squirrels, I'm just like... cool, squirrels everywhere."
13-12-2018T12:18:52,SpazztasticKiwi,They’re just not really out when it’s raining
13-12-2018T12:19:04,CrimsonQuill,"Yeah, I like squirrels as long as their red ones."
13-12-2018T12:19:04,Azumachan,That's nuts.
13-12-2018T12:19:13,CrimsonQuill,I rather dislike grey squirrels.
13-12-2018T12:19:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Yet this one decided to be an exception
13-12-2018T12:19:18,CrimsonQuill,"And yes, it is nuts."
13-12-2018T12:21:37,Azumachan,I apologize for this terrible joke.

13-12-2018T12:22:04,CrimsonQuill,I'm going to watch my daily double-bill of anime.
13-12-2018T12:22:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d like to start putting seeds out for the squirrels but I’d hate to encourage them from their natural winter habits

13-12-2018T12:23:48,Twokinds,I think it's okay to leave out something once in a while.
13-12-2018T12:23:54,Twokinds,It's like a gift from the gods.
13-12-2018T12:24:12,TerraTheWizard,there's a squirrel that semi-regularly runs across the road & up my driveway to get to the trees behind my house
13-12-2018T12:24:15,SpazztasticKiwi,But it’s cold. They need to keep their fuzzy tails in their nests
13-12-2018T12:24:29,TerraTheWizard,there was one squirrel that did this & got hit by a car
13-12-2018T12:24:31,Twokinds,True
13-12-2018T12:24:34,TerraTheWizard,was totally fine
13-12-2018T12:24:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m goin on in to work
13-12-2018T12:24:45,Twokinds,It's not very cold here at the moment
13-12-2018T12:25:17,Twokinds,54F here
13-12-2018T12:25:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Not here either but we’ve been having sort of swings from “ok” to “nope”
13-12-2018T12:25:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Flip flopping
13-12-2018T12:25:41,TerraTheWizard,so we had this one squirrel that we recognised for years by the fact it's tail had a straight tip

13-12-2018T13:00:40,TorqueEmUp,I have never once seen a mink in person.
13-12-2018T13:01:36,TorqueEmUp,Even though they are native to most of the U.S
13-12-2018T13:09:56,Twokinds,Me either
13-12-2018T13:16:43,TerraTheWizard,for some reason i always think they're a lizard from the name
13-12-2018T13:16:57,TerraTheWizard,but they're a cute lil weasel thing
13-12-2018T13:30:52,CrimsonQuill,A mink killed our guinea fowl and turkey.

13-12-2018T15:01:01,SpazztasticKiwi,A feeder might help it. It’s got a disadvantage being different

13-12-2018T16:12:28,CrimsonQuill,Where was it? The sketch?
13-12-2018T16:12:51,Azumachan,Old Patreon
13-12-2018T16:12:53,Twokinds,It was a random sketch I did randomly during a stream a long time ago.
13-12-2018T16:12:57,iliar,I totally agree. This sketch was in my plans for the Nora Cards. But as usual for all good sketches there are not enough cards.

13-12-2018T16:19:43,CrimsonQuill,"It's short, but it's so...deep. So beautiful."
13-12-2018T16:19:53,CrimsonQuill,"It's called REFUNCT, and it's on Steam."
13-12-2018T16:19:57,Azumachan,"If it's a link ask before to post, if not post the name."
13-12-2018T16:20:11,CrimsonQuill,I think that Tom'd enjoy it.
13-12-2018T16:20:21,CrimsonQuill,REFUNCT-I just finished it/
13-12-2018T16:21:42,Twokinds,I feel as though I've seen this game before

13-12-2018T16:22:04,CrimsonQuill,"Yeah, I think you'd like it."
13-12-2018T16:22:25,CrimsonQuill,"I had no idea as to what it was, but I was told to try it, and it's brilliant."
13-12-2018T16:22:27,bignibbahours,nut no my friend has to make me join this and shit
13-12-2018T16:22:32,CrimsonQuill,"Very short, but neat."

13-12-2018T16:22:53,Twokinds,It's only 3 dollars?

13-12-2018T16:23:11,CrimsonQuill,I didn't actually buy it though
13-12-2018T16:23:18,Azumachan,"One more game lost in the steam library, never to be found again."
13-12-2018T16:23:18,CrimsonQuill,He just shared his steam library with me
13-12-2018T16:23:32,EggRollss,You don't have to be an ass if you don't want to be here leave jorden I never told you to join just wanted you to come wacth
13-12-2018T16:23:34,CrimsonQuill,But I might just buy it for myself.

13-12-2018T16:25:50,CrimsonQuill,@Azuma do you play steam games often? I sometimes find it hard to cram 'em in what with all the stuff that's going on.
13-12-2018T16:25:57,CrimsonQuill,@AzumaChan
13-12-2018T16:27:48,Azumachan,I'm not a big gamer.
13-12-2018T16:28:32,CrimsonQuill,Hmmm...I wasn't really able to game much until about two years ago anyhow.
13-12-2018T16:28:58,Azumachan,Pokemon if you call that gaming.
13-12-2018T16:29:00,CrimsonQuill,"To be honest, I hope to cut back gaming a bit-spend more time drawing and playing with Lego."
13-12-2018T16:29:13,CrimsonQuill,I don't really play Pokemon.
13-12-2018T16:29:29,CrimsonQuill,"I am partial to Chess, but I almost never find a person who wants to play."
13-12-2018T16:32:05,CrimsonQuill,"Okay, I'm off. Goodnight all! :ptv-greetings::ptv-sleepy:"

13-12-2018T21:35:26,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
13-12-2018T21:35:29,bignibbahours,fallout 76 is crappy
13-12-2018T21:35:32,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I saw that. Looked pretty good.
13-12-2018T21:35:32,ShadowSoap,Did they?
13-12-2018T21:35:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"that got canned, Quinn"
13-12-2018T21:35:35,HeresyArtStream,The shaders for Fallout 3 and New Vegas can take some splendid looking screenshots but for gameplay they are pretty bad.
13-12-2018T21:35:35,ZRO4825,Remaster them after someone gets Bethesda a properly working game engine. :joy:
13-12-2018T21:35:40,Mippy,I’m waiting for Duck Hunt 2.0
13-12-2018T21:35:42,unsteddyphoenix,Might give new vegas a try now
13-12-2018T21:35:45,ShadowSoap,"Well, another reason to by Fallout 4 for PC"
13-12-2018T21:35:49,MallardDuckAvia,Hey Tom will Sealeen and Landen be in the comic again soon?
13-12-2018T21:35:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,new vegas is pretty good
13-12-2018T21:36:10,HeresyArtStream,Wanna hear something truly heretical?
13-12-2018T21:36:19,QuinnMalachite,yeeeeeeeeeees
13-12-2018T21:36:19,ShadowSoap,o.o
13-12-2018T21:36:20,unsteddyphoenix,always
13-12-2018T21:36:21,HeresyArtStream,I own New Vegas and have never played it. :cheresyartstream-nowthatswhatIcal:

13-12-2018T21:36:28,Ordithus,That's just sad
13-12-2018T21:36:29,unsteddyphoenix,lol
13-12-2018T21:36:30,bignibbahours,wut if they made a fallout game that took place in ohio?
13-12-2018T21:36:30,QuinnMalachite,Yeah me too
13-12-2018T21:36:46,QuinnMalachite,"bought it on sale, have hundreds of hours in fallout 4"
13-12-2018T21:36:56,ShadowSoap,Cleveland already looks like its from a Fallout game
13-12-2018T21:36:58,Ordithus,I have too many games with 0 hours
13-12-2018T21:37:01,QuinnMalachite,but then fallout 4 has a mod so you can play as an anthro fox
13-12-2018T21:37:01,Mippy,*Sealeen emote* +:ctwokinds-lynnsmile:=:ptv-shipit: kind of
13-12-2018T21:37:15,bignibbahours,very tru shadow
13-12-2018T21:37:16,QuinnMalachite,lol
13-12-2018T21:37:20,Hg17Lamont2002,Anyone know how long the streams usually last?
13-12-2018T21:37:26,Combak,Fallout Cincinnati!
13-12-2018T21:37:31,HeresyArtStream,I want a Fallout game where you can play as non-human races.
13-12-2018T21:37:31,Combak,"Also, hi Tom!"
13-12-2018T21:37:37,HeresyArtStream,"Or post-human, if that's the right term."
13-12-2018T21:37:41,bignibbahours,i mean like central and southern ohio tho
13-12-2018T21:37:43,Mippy,Hours :csagesaga-c3:
13-12-2018T21:37:45,HeresyArtStream,"Like super mutants, ghouls and synths"
13-12-2018T21:37:45,Ordithus,Pittsburgh was a pretty interesting DLC
13-12-2018T21:37:51,QuinnMalachite,Well there's that anthro fox mod for fallout 4 :D
13-12-2018T21:37:55,CatzArt,Hello! I have returned!
13-12-2018T21:37:56,HeresyArtStream,heh
13-12-2018T21:38:01,Ordithus,Hi Catz
13-12-2018T21:38:06,CrRAR,hey catz
13-12-2018T21:38:09,ShadowSoap,Hello Catz. Your return is duly noted.
13-12-2018T21:38:13,Mippy,Hmmmm...supper time
13-12-2018T21:38:24,CrRAR,:9
13-12-2018T21:38:37,HeresyArtStream,"And like, if you are a super mutant, some settlements will be inaccessible because people will shoot at you on site. But you can go through mutant camps with no problems."
13-12-2018T21:38:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,CrRARARARARAR:ctwokinds-reniderp_flip:
13-12-2018T21:38:47,CatzArt,Just finished up some art although my mail alerted me to this stream a half hour later than it should
13-12-2018T21:39:08,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-reniderp:MARVVVALARRRERLAAR
13-12-2018T21:39:19,HeresyArtStream,"Exploring the underground as a ghoul is easier but you will be discriminated against on the surface, and some settlements might not allow you in."
13-12-2018T21:39:19,unsteddyphoenix,yo cr
13-12-2018T21:39:28,ChaosHetra,I was promised beer
13-12-2018T21:39:28,CrRAR,heyo unsteddy
13-12-2018T21:39:29,Rosscoe,And the crazy has begun
13-12-2018T21:39:33,ChaosHetra,where is the beer
13-12-2018T21:39:37,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-FloDance:
13-12-2018T21:39:39,ShadowSoap,That sounds super interesting Heresy.
13-12-2018T21:39:39,Rosscoe,Ok im off to bed. I need ot get up in 7 half hours
13-12-2018T21:39:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-FloDance:
13-12-2018T21:39:43,HeresyArtStream,I am not really sure what the balance on playing as a synth would be though.
13-12-2018T21:39:44,Ordithus,Night Ross
13-12-2018T21:39:48,ShadowSoap,GN Rosscoe
13-12-2018T21:39:51,bignibbahours,"i cant drink, wish i could"
13-12-2018T21:39:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night ross
13-12-2018T21:40:08,CatzArt,Herta if you want beer I'm gonna need to see some ID
13-12-2018T21:40:19,Combak,Assuming synths stay ingame.
13-12-2018T21:40:23,HeresyArtStream,yeah
13-12-2018T21:40:27,MikeHollard,"waddup, it ya boi, Dr Mike .J. Hollard"
13-12-2018T21:40:34,HeresyArtStream,At least playing as a mutant or ghoul would be neat though
13-12-2018T21:40:51,bignibbahours,cleveland is like one big hoover town
13-12-2018T21:40:54,HeresyArtStream,"Also, mutants are naturally strong but can't use power armor."
13-12-2018T21:41:05,CrRAR,feel the ADVERSITY~
13-12-2018T21:41:20,CatzArt,What about my hometown of Cleveland Nibba?
13-12-2018T21:41:37,Ordithus,I like the boardgame.  Super Mutants and ghouls heal from rads
13-12-2018T21:41:40,MallardDuckAvia,You can’t say that word it’s racist
13-12-2018T21:41:55,Corinthian,Yo
13-12-2018T21:41:55,HeresyArtStream,Different quest availability for different races is something that would be cool also. It would encourage people to play through the game with more than one character.
13-12-2018T21:41:59,CrRAR,lol ord
13-12-2018T21:42:00,Ordithus,Hi Corin
13-12-2018T21:42:05,CatzArt,hey corin!

13-12-2018T21:42:13,Twokinds,I hate illustrating indoor spaces. I'm so bad at it
13-12-2018T21:42:19,Ordithus,Wha?
13-12-2018T21:42:19,neropan,hello~
13-12-2018T21:42:23,Ordithus,Hi nero

13-12-2018T21:42:26,Combak,Hi Nero!
13-12-2018T21:42:26,ShadowSoap,"Your pic is quite neat, Corin."
13-12-2018T21:42:27,Twokinds,"I'm much more at home in organic, outdoor backgrounds"
13-12-2018T21:42:31,unsteddyphoenix,Ayy NEro
13-12-2018T21:42:32,Hg17Lamont2002,You can do it Tom ⚡️⚡️
13-12-2018T21:42:33,HeresyArtStream,I am jelly of Tom's interior rendering skills. -o-
13-12-2018T21:42:35,SageSaga,yo Nero- Same Tom
13-12-2018T21:42:36,Ordithus,"Tom, you lie.  You're really good at interiors"
13-12-2018T21:42:39,CrRAR,darn ornate details
13-12-2018T21:42:43,ShadowSoap,"It's something to keep improving on, Tom!"
13-12-2018T21:42:43,Ordithus,Maybe they just take you longer
13-12-2018T21:43:02,Foxpie,sound like we need more elf stlye houses then
13-12-2018T21:43:03,HeresyArtStream,I read Dragon Masquerade and then cry myself to sleep. :P
13-12-2018T21:43:06,Tharkis,hoi neropan
13-12-2018T21:43:08,unsteddyphoenix,All the dragon masqueride interiors look pretty good~
13-12-2018T21:43:08,Tharkis,o/
13-12-2018T21:43:15,MikeHollard,"drawing interiors is time consuming, depends on artist's effort and patient"
13-12-2018T21:43:15,CatzArt,Well the more you practice the better you get. Why not trying that thing that Sage used for that house he drew a few streams back?
13-12-2018T21:43:19,CrRAR,trace's estate why you HOUSE so much!?
13-12-2018T21:43:39,HeresyArtStream,X3
13-12-2018T21:43:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Guess who didn’t get off at 8 like they were supposed to
13-12-2018T21:43:46,Ordithus,"Oasis room, how about a Field room and a Forest room"
13-12-2018T21:43:50,CatzArt,you kiwi?
13-12-2018T21:43:51,CrRAR,hehheh
13-12-2018T21:43:58,unsteddyphoenix,Steve from accounting?
13-12-2018T21:43:59,Ordithus,Hi Kiwi
13-12-2018T21:44:05,Combak,Hi Kiwi!
13-12-2018T21:44:08,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-sleepoverB:
13-12-2018T21:44:08,Bgrmystr2,what's he wearing? :O
13-12-2018T21:44:09,ShadowSoap,"Hello, Kiwi!"
13-12-2018T21:44:14,Bgrmystr2,Khackis?
13-12-2018T21:44:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-sleepoverA:Kiwi!!!
13-12-2018T21:44:32,Bgrmystr2,hey kiwi
13-12-2018T21:44:58,HeresyArtStream,Eventually I am gonna have to start modeling rooms and ships for my sci-fi comic. I am not gonna do straight CG backgrounds but I am way too lazy to draw all that stuff from scratch for like 300 pages or however long the series lasts.
13-12-2018T21:44:59,SpazztasticKiwi,🍔!!
13-12-2018T21:45:05,SpazztasticKiwi,MaRv!!
13-12-2018T21:45:15,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-unimpressed:
13-12-2018T21:45:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Ooooooooorrrrrddddddd
13-12-2018T21:45:21,HeresyArtStream,The plan is to make models for all that stuff and then pose and trace.
13-12-2018T21:45:35,QuinnMalachite,I've seen Seff go with the 3D model the basics and draw over it option
13-12-2018T21:45:37,unsteddyphoenix,Ooh clever.
13-12-2018T21:45:38,QuinnMalachite,yeah that
13-12-2018T21:46:08,SpazztasticKiwi,And let’s not forget
13-12-2018T21:46:11,SpazztasticKiwi,TOM
13-12-2018T21:46:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Sage!
13-12-2018T21:46:24,SpazztasticKiwi,👋🏻 👋🏻
13-12-2018T21:46:25,HeresyArtStream,I am not gonna do it The Marvel Way™ and just get free stuff on Google Sketchup and render it out as lineart though. :P
13-12-2018T21:46:46,HeresyArtStream,That is like premium-levels of lazy and thrift.
13-12-2018T21:46:53,Corinthian,Indeed
13-12-2018T21:47:04,CatzArt,How is that the marvel way Hershy?
13-12-2018T21:47:14,unsteddyphoenix,extremely efficient though
13-12-2018T21:47:16,CatzArt,Heresy not hershy
13-12-2018T21:47:20,HeresyArtStream,Marvel constantly takes shortcuts in their comics to make them as cheaply as possible.
13-12-2018T21:47:24,unsteddyphoenix,For mass-produced comicing
13-12-2018T21:47:28,HeresyArtStream,The end result is very sterile and dull looking drawings.
13-12-2018T21:47:33,Ordithus,"When you have to make lots of comics, shortcuts are tempting"
13-12-2018T21:47:47,Ordithus,Especially when you've got someone above you shouting about budgets and schedules
13-12-2018T21:47:59,Hg17Lamont2002,Facts
13-12-2018T21:48:01,SageSaga,short cuts arent a bad thing- work smart not hard
13-12-2018T21:48:03,HeresyArtStream,"Well yea, Marvel's individual comics don't even sell very well so they have to make up for it by running lots of series at once."
13-12-2018T21:48:08,CatzArt,Lucky me I'm too stupid to take short cuts with my art
13-12-2018T21:48:17,HeresyArtStream,"And if you are doing that, you have to make the comics as cheaply as possible."
13-12-2018T21:48:19,Combak,Good for you?
13-12-2018T21:48:46,ShadowSoap,Lucky me I don't got to worry 'bout all this 'cause I can't draw!
13-12-2018T21:49:01,Hg17Lamont2002,^^
13-12-2018T21:49:02,CatzArt,Soap everyone can draw
13-12-2018T21:49:10,HeresyArtStream,"Like, that Batman Damnation book was a fairly expensive book to make, but DC made their money back by selling a pretty solid amount of copies and they charged a premium price for it."
13-12-2018T21:49:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Nobody tell my diet this but I’ve had like three pieces of strawberry cheesecake today
13-12-2018T21:49:15,ShadowSoap,I can't draw *Well*
13-12-2018T21:49:21,SageSaga,a lot of the DC and Marvel comics look fantastic and have great styles
13-12-2018T21:49:27,Hg17Lamont2002,I can shade  like a mad man
13-12-2018T21:49:31,HeresyArtStream,"If you need to put out 20+ pages a month though and you're only selling 5k copies, you have to make the comic cheap."
13-12-2018T21:49:35,Ordithus,"Sounds delicious, Kiwi"
13-12-2018T21:49:40,SageSaga,but like all mediums that are done quickly they cant spend as much time on each page
13-12-2018T21:49:47,SpazztasticKiwi,They were
13-12-2018T21:49:48,unsteddyphoenix,we'll keep it on the down low
13-12-2018T21:49:52,HeresyArtStream,That means you have to pay the artists cheap and that means the artists have to work fast so they can get everything done on time.
13-12-2018T21:49:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,kiwi making us hungry
13-12-2018T21:49:55,ShadowSoap,The only things I'm decent at is maps
13-12-2018T21:50:00,CatzArt,I wonder which medium is faster Digital or traditional?
13-12-2018T21:50:07,ShadowSoap,I can't draw a living thing to save my own life
13-12-2018T21:50:20,unsteddyphoenix,draw a living map
13-12-2018T21:50:30,Zakuru,"i charge cheap, and my boss scoffed  me for it"
13-12-2018T21:50:34,ShadowSoap,:ptv-confused:
13-12-2018T21:50:42,Hg17Lamont2002,What about a stick figure 😂 pretty sure you can draw that
13-12-2018T21:50:48,CatzArt,Im the opposite Soap all I can draw are people but I cant draw a map for my comic world to save my life
13-12-2018T21:51:13,HeresyArtStream,When I was younger I drew lots of horror stuff.
13-12-2018T21:51:19,HeresyArtStream,I loved drawing zombies and monsters.
13-12-2018T21:51:29,Zakuru,monsters :eyes:
13-12-2018T21:51:30,ShadowSoap,"Well, yeah, HG. But I can't do things like hands, faces, and proper body ratios."
13-12-2018T21:51:34,Combak,Must... resist... urge... to comment.
13-12-2018T21:51:38,Zakuru,you'd love my demon boy
13-12-2018T21:51:46,CatzArt,When i was younger I drew werewolves and only werewolves.
13-12-2018T21:51:47,Hg17Lamont2002,True and I understand that for sure
13-12-2018T21:52:06,Hg17Lamont2002,Body composition I can’t get ☹️
13-12-2018T21:52:22,Zakuru,7 1/2 heads tall
13-12-2018T21:52:37,ShadowSoap,"But, I love doodling maps. I do it for fun. I'm even doing it rn"
13-12-2018T21:52:44,CatzArt,yeah I have issues with my arms being to thin
13-12-2018T21:52:53,Ordithus,Maddie looks cool with that armor.  Like some badass hero (from a distance)
13-12-2018T21:52:55,CatzArt,not my arms but drawing arms
13-12-2018T21:52:56,HeresyArtStream,I drew maps for D&D games
13-12-2018T21:53:02,Hg17Lamont2002,One thing I like drawing is dream catchers and idk why 0.0
13-12-2018T21:53:27,MviluUatusun,"Your arms are too thin, Catz?  You should work out a bit.  You'll put muscle on them before you know it."
13-12-2018T21:53:46,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-keifacepalm: Mvilu!
13-12-2018T21:53:53,MviluUatusun,Oooooh.  The arms you draw are too thin.  Gomen.
13-12-2018T21:53:54,Zakuru,what if the character is a twiggy twink?
13-12-2018T21:53:57,MviluUatusun,Howdy Ord.
13-12-2018T21:54:07,HeresyArtStream,speaking of thin arms
13-12-2018T21:54:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Gotta put some mush in the muscles
13-12-2018T21:54:14,HeresyArtStream,when I was a kid I drew Sonic characters :V
13-12-2018T21:54:23,Zakuru,oh god
13-12-2018T21:54:26,unsteddyphoenix,mushcles
13-12-2018T21:54:27,ShadowSoap,o.o
13-12-2018T21:54:28,ShadowSoap,o-o
13-12-2018T21:54:30,QuinnMalachite,"Hey, Sonic was cool once"
13-12-2018T21:54:31,Ordithus,:ptv-nope:
13-12-2018T21:54:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,mooo clese
13-12-2018T21:54:35,Zakuru,once
13-12-2018T21:54:36,Hg17Lamont2002,Have y’all seen the new poster for sonic p.p
13-12-2018T21:54:36,unsteddyphoenix,Apparently.
13-12-2018T21:54:42,CatzArt,Heh I wanted to say I draw arms to thin Mvilu. But yes my arms are thin. when your 6 foot and only 124 pounds. I am a twig.
13-12-2018T21:54:42,HeresyArtStream,"The thing is, I grew out of drawing Sonic. :P"

13-12-2018T22:18:23,totallynotTrace,super cliche but sometimes thats ok
13-12-2018T22:18:25,CrRAR,"Imagine a plaque at its feet reading: ""Absolutely, NO booping!"""
13-12-2018T22:18:44,InTheLionsDen,It is just a decoy. Beware the tentacle monster door.

13-12-2018T22:18:57,totallynotTrace,"and if you boop it, it just bites your head off"
13-12-2018T22:18:58,HeresyArtStream,do not feed the statues
13-12-2018T22:19:08,CrRAR,xD
13-12-2018T22:19:09,QuinnMalachite,he's just so good at being a butler that no one has seen him yet
13-12-2018T22:19:29,HeresyArtStream,He's an assassin playing the long game
13-12-2018T22:19:36,CrRAR,In trace's estate statues feed YOU.
13-12-2018T22:19:36,Hg17Lamont2002,Wait

13-12-2018T22:20:22,Hg17Lamont2002,Lost my thought

13-12-2018T22:28:33,QuinnMalachite,Somehow you have managed to make Nora even kinkier Heresy
13-12-2018T22:28:34,Ordithus,That has some weird implications
13-12-2018T22:28:40,MviluUatusun,Thanks everybody.  Y'all take care until next time.

13-12-2018T22:29:40,Ordithus,Sage streams saturday
13-12-2018T22:29:40,Hg17Lamont2002,Well I know what to look for
13-12-2018T22:29:40,HeresyArtStream,the Targarians are into some pretty weird shit and somehow they have dragon in their bloodline.
13-12-2018T22:30:37,RyanReaper,Will your last Patreon post be posted to deviant art? Cuz it’s still hidden.
13-12-2018T22:31:19,HeresyArtStream,"Tom's stuff always gets posted on DA if it's locked on Patreon, just not right away sometimes."
13-12-2018T22:31:20,HeresyArtStream,I think?
13-12-2018T22:31:38,ShadowSoap,Yeah. It'll get to DA eventually.
13-12-2018T22:31:53,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah thats right
13-12-2018T22:31:58,HeresyArtStream,It has tigerbutt so it has to be patrons-only
13-12-2018T22:32:11,Bgrmystr2,he may have forgotten to repost it to DA
13-12-2018T22:32:16,HeresyArtStream,"Patreon's moderation team is kind of scary. x,x"
13-12-2018T22:32:31,Bgrmystr2,"I don't think they're scary, just prudes"
13-12-2018T22:32:34,Ordithus,"""a little extra gift for Patrons"" but maybe someday"
13-12-2018T22:32:43,RyanReaper,I wanna see tiger butt.... Tom please post it to DA :(
13-12-2018T22:32:46,Bgrmystr2,tom's music is ded
13-12-2018T22:33:07,HeresyArtStream,"The thing is, there's there's two sets of rules on Patreon. There's the public rules and the secret rules, and no-one's allowed to see the secret rules."
13-12-2018T22:33:08,Combak,RIP
13-12-2018T22:33:20,Twokinds,It will be posted to dA later
13-12-2018T22:33:26,Twokinds,It's a gift for Patrons
13-12-2018T22:33:28,Twokinds,They get it early

13-12-2018T22:33:34,ShadowSoap,Fair enough
13-12-2018T22:33:35,Hg17Lamont2002,Last think I saw on Patreon was Natani and Zen I believe with hot chocolate
13-12-2018T22:33:39,unsteddyphoenix,Its a very nice gift~ <3
13-12-2018T22:33:43,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
13-12-2018T22:33:46,totallynotTrace,ok
13-12-2018T22:33:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"That was Raine, Hg"
13-12-2018T22:33:53,Ordithus,Lamont... that was Zen and Raine
13-12-2018T22:33:55,RyanReaper,Well deserved gift :)
13-12-2018T22:33:55,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I heard a guy got his patreon banned 'cause of things he said off-site
13-12-2018T22:33:56,SageSaga,we know 2 things so far about the secret rules of Patreon
13-12-2018T22:34:00,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RaineEep:
13-12-2018T22:34:03,HeresyArtStream,"You find out what Patreon's secret rules are when you get banned for them. x,x"
13-12-2018T22:34:08,unsteddyphoenix,And nowhere in their policy does it say that could happen
13-12-2018T22:34:10,SageSaga,"Implied Nudity is the same thing as nudity, and Butts are lewd"
13-12-2018T22:34:16,CrRAR,xD
13-12-2018T22:34:29,HeresyArtStream,The public rules specifically state that you will only be moderated for what gets posted on your Patreon page.
13-12-2018T22:34:39,HeresyArtStream,But the secret rules apparently say something much different.
13-12-2018T22:34:56,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah.
13-12-2018T22:35:12,unsteddyphoenix,Things always turn tyrannical when their competition dies~
13-12-2018T22:35:31,Bgrmystr2,"lol, if they have these rules, they have to post them publicly"
13-12-2018T22:35:37,HeresyArtStream,"So, hopefully the patreon moderation team is not watching this stream. 👀"
13-12-2018T22:35:37,QuinnMalachite,Sounds about right for Patreon
13-12-2018T22:35:42,CrRAR,"nudity is hitler, and implied nudity literally worse than hitler, got it."
13-12-2018T22:35:42,ShadowSoap,Monopolies are never a good thing
13-12-2018T22:35:43,HeresyArtStream,Or else I might be in trouble :P
13-12-2018T22:35:54,unsteddyphoenix,True heresy
13-12-2018T22:35:58,unsteddyphoenix,Be careful what you say~
13-12-2018T22:36:20,CrRAR,"""You have no power here"""
13-12-2018T22:36:24,HeresyArtStream,"They've banned people who bring in a lot more money than me for some pretty petty reasons, so I do need to be careful."
13-12-2018T22:37:19,HeresyArtStream,"Until something is done about the payment processor situation though, it might be a while before any patreon alternatives are viable."
13-12-2018T22:38:14,Bgrmystr2,I don't think it would take much to make a viable alternative to patreon lol
13-12-2018T22:38:25,HeresyArtStream,That's not so much the problem
13-12-2018T22:38:29,Combak,How about Paypal though?
13-12-2018T22:38:32,HeresyArtStream,^
13-12-2018T22:38:37,HeresyArtStream,Paypal is the real problem.
13-12-2018T22:38:45,HeresyArtStream,They are friends with all the other big tech companies.
13-12-2018T22:39:09,QuinnMalachite,"Yep, silicon valley is a tight knit group"
13-12-2018T22:39:12,HeresyArtStream,"So patreon can be like ""Hey Paypal, please don't let people pay that website, because they want to get in on our racket and they haven't kissed the ring."""
13-12-2018T22:39:19,QuinnMalachite,they look out for each other and make trouble for each others competitors
13-12-2018T22:39:31,HeresyArtStream,yep
13-12-2018T22:39:36,Bgrmystr2,Paypal does not make the rules on what people buy online.
13-12-2018T22:39:41,Bgrmystr2,"It's our money, not theirs"
13-12-2018T22:39:48,HeresyArtStream,"And ironically, these were the people who like 5 minutes ago claimed to be all for net neutrality."
13-12-2018T22:40:04,HeresyArtStream,We do need some kind of net neutrality rules but they need to target silicon valley.
13-12-2018T22:40:10,QuinnMalachite,"It's like price fixing, but on a horrifying scale"
13-12-2018T22:40:20,Combak,"Bgr, the problem is getting the money to the people on the other end of the computer."
13-12-2018T22:40:25,QuinnMalachite,"that's not net neutrality, they do want net neutrality"
13-12-2018T22:40:31,ZRO4825,"The problem is that sites can't run what Paypal doesn't want them to run, or Paypal threatens to pull their support, and those sites almot all typically rely on a fair chunk of their business to go through Paypal."
13-12-2018T22:40:40,HeresyArtStream,"Well, they want rules for the telecoms but not themselves."
13-12-2018T22:40:46,QuinnMalachite,"This is bigger, this is on the whole entity scale"
13-12-2018T22:40:53,QuinnMalachite,exactly
13-12-2018T22:40:57,HeresyArtStream,So it's more like they want the government to put their finger on the scale for their team instead of the other team.
13-12-2018T22:41:18,QuinnMalachite,Net neutrality wouldn't help smaller companies though
13-12-2018T22:41:22,ZRO4825,"So if Paypal says ""Hey, no more porn"" the site either agrees, or gets their Paypal support yanked.'"
13-12-2018T22:41:22,Ordithus,I would have thought Karen would be much more excited to see a lizard
13-12-2018T22:41:42,HeresyArtStream,"So really, no-one in the corporate sector is looking out for the little guy, which I think should have been pretty obvious when the whole net neutrality thing started. :P"
13-12-2018T22:42:01,QuinnMalachite,it would just mean that all the silicon valley companies would have to pay the ISP's not not dick them over
13-12-2018T22:42:11,QuinnMalachite,"yep, sounds about right Heresy"
13-12-2018T22:42:15,RanaMcNeil,@ZRI4825 Thats why you should NEVER tell Paypal youre paying for porn.
13-12-2018T22:42:18,HeresyArtStream,"When Google, Facebook, Paypal, Twitter, etc. are all asking for the same thing, our collective red flags should be going off."
13-12-2018T22:42:31,BobbyJobby,"If there was a viable Patreon alternative, would Tom migrate, or would he hang on until the bitter end?"
13-12-2018T22:42:39,Bgrmystr2,"It's not like paypal is our parents and can tell us what to and not to buy, though Rana"
13-12-2018T22:43:01,ZRO4825,"They can, actually. The downside of Terms of Service."
13-12-2018T22:43:08,Issus,FCC is being investigated right now as to why millions of known fake votes were cast and nobody bothered to look into it. xD
13-12-2018T22:43:08,RanaMcNeil,Paypal is in my opinion the biggest bitch i know
13-12-2018T22:43:13,HeresyArtStream,So far Patreon has been good for me. It's the most popular maker support site so I wouldn't leave unless they started making things difficult for me.
13-12-2018T22:43:33,Bgrmystr2,"ToS doesn't give them legal right to restrict my usage of money, that's not something they can hold against me"
13-12-2018T22:43:33,ZahnHolley,Goodnight guys i.ll seeyou soon
13-12-2018T22:43:38,RanaMcNeil,so what they dont know they couldnt block or deny.
13-12-2018T22:43:39,ZRO4825,"Take care, Zahn~"
13-12-2018T22:43:39,Ordithus,Night Zahn
13-12-2018T22:43:39,CrRAR,bye zahn
13-12-2018T22:43:40,Bgrmystr2,even if it says so
13-12-2018T22:43:42,HeresyArtStream,"However, if my patrons were all migrating to another site and I was losing subs, I would consider moving."
13-12-2018T22:43:45,HeresyArtStream,night
13-12-2018T22:44:09,Issus,"Paypal basically pretended to be a bank, without having to follow the banking regulations, iirc."
13-12-2018T22:44:16,HeresyArtStream,yep
13-12-2018T22:44:17,ShadowSoap,GN Zahn
13-12-2018T22:44:29,FoxxTrotter,"G'night, Zahn."
13-12-2018T22:44:32,Bgrmystr2,"Banks are trash anyway, not that paypal is much better, but lesser of two evils atm"
13-12-2018T22:44:42,HeresyArtStream,I'm in a credit union.
13-12-2018T22:45:10,Bgrmystr2,"I used to be, but they're the same thing"
13-12-2018T22:45:26,HeresyArtStream,Downside to the credit union is that the nearest teller is like an hour away. >:|
13-12-2018T22:45:46,ShadowSoap,That's quite a nuisance.
13-12-2018T22:46:08,ShadowSoap,The bank I go through has locations throughout my whole local area
13-12-2018T22:46:18,HeresyArtStream,"Usually it's not a problem, but when I have physical cash I want to deposit it becomes a headache."
13-12-2018T22:46:39,ShadowSoap,Yeah.
13-12-2018T22:46:53,HeresyArtStream,Usually I don't have a lot of physical cash on me.
13-12-2018T22:47:01,unsteddyphoenix,who does nowadays
13-12-2018T22:47:07,HeresyArtStream,"But if say, I went to a convention and was doodling for people, then it would get tricky."
13-12-2018T22:47:37,QuinnMalachite,"mhm, apple pay"
13-12-2018T22:47:38,ShadowSoap,I only carry cash.
13-12-2018T22:47:47,ShadowSoap,Don't got any plastic
13-12-2018T22:48:21,CrRAR,"aww, Karen's ears are tucked a little bit."
13-12-2018T22:48:30,HeresyArtStream,"I don't have a credit card. On the one hand I have no credit card debt, but on the other, using a debit card online is a lot less safe than a credit card."
13-12-2018T22:48:48,HeresyArtStream,And now I tell them all about my terrible story with EA Games and Origin!
13-12-2018T22:48:57,ShadowSoap,Oh...
13-12-2018T22:48:59,ShadowSoap,Oh No
13-12-2018T22:49:00,CrRAR,Trace baked in all the functions.
13-12-2018T22:49:01,unsteddyphoenix,"But if you dont use a credit card, you cant get a credit rating"
13-12-2018T22:49:01,ShadowSoap,Not Them
13-12-2018T22:49:04,HeresyArtStream,"Basically, there was the huge PS3 hack a few years ago"
13-12-2018T22:49:10,unsteddyphoenix,Lol Cr
13-12-2018T22:49:14,HeresyArtStream,I had the same password on PSN as I did on Origin
13-12-2018T22:49:26,ShadowSoap,.-.
13-12-2018T22:49:31,HeresyArtStream,I forgot to change my Origin password because I hardly bought anything on it except some Battlefield 3 DLC
13-12-2018T22:49:32,Hg17Lamont2002,Dang I remember  that
13-12-2018T22:49:36,totallynotTrace,oh yeah that hack. Got my favorite game out of it
13-12-2018T22:49:45,Hg17Lamont2002,Dad got hacked on it
13-12-2018T22:49:53,HeresyArtStream,then some babboon found out my password from an archive
13-12-2018T22:50:03,QuinnMalachite,ohh :(
13-12-2018T22:50:07,HeresyArtStream,they used it to log into my origin account and bought $300 worth of pretend soccer money
13-12-2018T22:50:10,Hg17Lamont2002,Dang that sucks
13-12-2018T22:50:17,HeresyArtStream,and that's when the bank stopped the transactions
13-12-2018T22:50:23,HeresyArtStream,they would have bought more.
13-12-2018T22:50:29,QuinnMalachite,:/
13-12-2018T22:50:33,ShadowSoap,Ouch...
13-12-2018T22:50:39,HeresyArtStream,"I call the bank, which is what I was supposed to do, and the bank got me my money back."
13-12-2018T22:50:51,Hg17Lamont2002,That’s good atleast
13-12-2018T22:50:54,HeresyArtStream,"Then I contact EA's customer support, like I'm supposed to"
13-12-2018T22:51:00,Combak,At the cost of your account.
13-12-2018T22:51:31,HeresyArtStream,"they say ""We take this very seriously"" and I am like ""Good, now please take this stupid copy of of Soccer men 2012 off of my account, I don't want it."""
13-12-2018T22:51:31,SageSaga,yeah we know this story
13-12-2018T22:51:33,totallynotTrace,Wipeout HD / Fury was amazing. I buy psn cards in cash so the most i can lose is $20 cuz thats what i keep on the accound
13-12-2018T22:51:34,HeresyArtStream,months pass
13-12-2018T22:51:35,QuinnMalachite,and I suppose EA bans you for disputing it?
13-12-2018T22:51:36,HeresyArtStream,then banned
13-12-2018T22:51:36,Issus,"Yeah, banning accounts and blocking users for using the system as it's designed to work should be illegal."
13-12-2018T22:51:54,Issus,"If you pay for an account and it's of value, them taking it from you should be theft as well."
13-12-2018T22:51:55,HeresyArtStream,EA banned me for the bounced payment.
13-12-2018T22:52:16,Twokinds,I'm having a lot of trouble
13-12-2018T22:52:20,Bgrmystr2,cuz that's theft on EA's part straight up.
13-12-2018T22:52:24,ZRO4825,"That's on the one hand fuckin stupid, and on the other hand, not surprising of EA."
13-12-2018T22:52:26,ShadowSoap,This is why EA is the literal scum of the gaming Industry.
13-12-2018T22:52:33,HeresyArtStream,"Every time EA releases a big expensive game and it flops, I smile a bit."
13-12-2018T22:52:37,unsteddyphoenix,Oooh is that hand gonna be in the foreground
13-12-2018T22:52:42,unsteddyphoenix,I like that that's cool
13-12-2018T22:52:42,totallynotTrace,Trouble Tom?
13-12-2018T22:52:43,ShadowSoap,There is a special place in Hell for the heads of EA
13-12-2018T22:52:53,CrRAR,this page has been evolving quite noticeably for sure
13-12-2018T22:52:56,Ordithus,Looks like it's challenging
13-12-2018T22:53:05,HeresyArtStream,I wonder if Battlefield V will be Dice's last game?
13-12-2018T22:53:11,unsteddyphoenix,"Good luck Tom, I really like the idea."
13-12-2018T22:53:12,ShadowSoap,Trying to organize all these hefty details
13-12-2018T22:53:16,Hg17Lamont2002,Yup from the time Tom had to restart his computer to now
13-12-2018T22:53:18,Ordithus,"Odd perspective, trying to fit the statue and Karen in..."
13-12-2018T22:53:35,QuinnMalachite,I doubt it Heresy
13-12-2018T22:53:38,HeresyArtStream,yeah
13-12-2018T22:53:40,Issus,"I'm hoping a few companies get the hint to stop releasing broken games, massive patches and day 1 DLC and microtransactions after the last few that bombed."
13-12-2018T22:53:44,QuinnMalachite,there's at least one more in there
13-12-2018T22:53:47,Issus,"But, people keep buying stuff so probably not."
13-12-2018T22:53:57,QuinnMalachite,but the last two Dice games have that typical EA footprint of
13-12-2018T22:54:01,HeresyArtStream,The only thing at EA that never sells badly is their sports games.
13-12-2018T22:54:01,QuinnMalachite,1) take good game
13-12-2018T22:54:05,Hg17Lamont2002,Most likely
13-12-2018T22:54:10,HeresyArtStream,I think eventually EA is only going to be sports and mobile.
13-12-2018T22:54:11,QuinnMalachite,2) make it really bad to try and make more money
13-12-2018T22:54:15,QuinnMalachite,3) no one buys it
13-12-2018T22:54:17,ShadowSoap,We need an organized Boycott of EA and other AAA developers.
13-12-2018T22:54:21,QuinnMalachite,4) surprisedpikachu.png
13-12-2018T22:54:30,Hg17Lamont2002,Lol

13-12-2018T22:54:46,totallynotTrace,Pika Pika
13-12-2018T22:54:47,HeresyArtStream,I think that the last EA game I bought was Battlefield 1. To be fair it was a very good game.
13-12-2018T22:54:49,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
13-12-2018T22:55:02,Hg17Lamont2002,I don’t buy much Ea games
13-12-2018T22:55:03,Issus,"I seem to remember the boycott group to COD, of which several hundred members were currently playing COD."
13-12-2018T22:55:03,unsteddyphoenix,"""Why is this lizard statue flexing?"""
13-12-2018T22:55:04,HeresyArtStream,I bought it from Amazon though because EA's never getting my card number again. :V
13-12-2018T22:55:07,QuinnMalachite,I missed out on bf1 and now worry I'll have missed that last good one ever
13-12-2018T22:55:07,Ordithus,"Colorizer isn't working any better, Sage?"
13-12-2018T22:55:08,ShadowSoap,BF 1 was decent
13-12-2018T22:55:11,totallynotTrace,the last EA game for me was Mass Effect 3
13-12-2018T22:55:14,Treeguy,"Its the publishers that ruin games, not the devs"
13-12-2018T22:55:18,Hg17Lamont2002,More into the Racing  more of all
13-12-2018T22:55:35,Issus,I haven't bought an EA game since I saw what they did to Simcity.
13-12-2018T22:55:41,HeresyArtStream,When publishers screw up they usually blame the developer.
13-12-2018T22:55:47,HeresyArtStream,Although lately they blame the customers first.
13-12-2018T22:55:47,Issus,"I didn't buy that either, but still saw the devastation."
13-12-2018T22:55:50,ShadowSoap,I don't like the direction 2K and Firaxis are going with the DLC for Civ VI
13-12-2018T22:55:51,ZRO4825,That's the only thing I'd miss from EA is the racing games. And those have been...lackluster laterly anyway.
13-12-2018T22:55:52,QuinnMalachite,"I'm not outright boycotting EA, I just don't believe any of their games are actually any good now"
13-12-2018T22:56:04,Hg17Lamont2002,Haha I still have that horrible app lol SimCity used to be my Jam
13-12-2018T22:56:12,Hg17Lamont2002,Now I have city Skylines
13-12-2018T22:56:15,HeresyArtStream,^
13-12-2018T22:56:18,ShadowSoap,^
13-12-2018T22:56:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,digiorno stuff crust pizza is a gift to my belly
13-12-2018T22:56:23,HeresyArtStream,City Skylines is the city game to play I hear.
13-12-2018T22:56:29,QuinnMalachite,^^^^^^^^^^
13-12-2018T22:56:31,QuinnMalachite,yeeeeeeees
13-12-2018T22:56:32,Issus,"I play Cities now, yeah. Simcity was the worst example of how to make a game."
13-12-2018T22:56:45,ShadowSoap,Although Paradox's treatment of DLC isn't the best
13-12-2018T22:56:47,Bgrmystr2,I'm not as big of a fan of Skylines
13-12-2018T22:56:51,Bgrmystr2,as other people are
13-12-2018T22:56:54,QuinnMalachite,don't get it on switch though
13-12-2018T22:56:56,HeresyArtStream,It's so sad that Maxis is gone. T_T
13-12-2018T22:56:59,QuinnMalachite,it runs horribly
13-12-2018T22:57:02,Issus,"Single player online requirement, servers overloaded, pay extra for normally included content, completely broken AI."
13-12-2018T22:57:02,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-LauraCry:
13-12-2018T22:57:06,totallynotTrace,I would play skylines but my cpu cant handle it
13-12-2018T22:57:13,FuryFaZeFurry,HAllo
13-12-2018T22:57:15,Hg17Lamont2002,City skylines just has that unique feel especially with their newest release of industries Dlc
13-12-2018T22:57:16,Issus,"And then yeah, killed Maxis because they served their purpose."
13-12-2018T22:57:18,HeresyArtStream,There's a funny joke about EA in Star Citizen
13-12-2018T22:57:20,ShadowSoap,Hello FurryFaze

13-12-2018T22:57:33,Bgrmystr2,"Played the crap outta nearly every SimCity game out there, literally every single one, and Skylines has so many problems. Not that SimCity2013 was better, cuz it was way worse"

13-12-2018T22:57:44,Hg17Lamont2002,Gn Foxx
13-12-2018T22:57:44,Bgrmystr2,but Skylines is not this godly thing
13-12-2018T22:57:45,HeresyArtStream,"Chris Roberts used to work for Origin Systems, which got bought by EA and then they closed it down and now it's just the name of their store."
13-12-2018T22:58:10,Ordithus,Night Foxx
13-12-2018T22:58:17,HeresyArtStream,"In Star Citizen, the in-game store for the flight sim is called ""Electronic Access"""
13-12-2018T22:58:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,nighty night foxx
13-12-2018T22:58:25,QuinnMalachite,is it crap?
13-12-2018T22:58:40,HeresyArtStream,"and in the lore they were once a great game publisher that started making garbage so they got bought out, and now only exist as the name of a game store. :V"
13-12-2018T22:58:49,ShadowSoap,XD
13-12-2018T22:58:52,QuinnMalachite,lol
13-12-2018T22:58:52,Hg17Lamont2002,Had a faze of total destruction when it came to city skylines
13-12-2018T22:59:05,QuinnMalachite,I'd have it be referenced as that crap company that no one buys from
13-12-2018T22:59:09,FuryFaZeFurry,"i started playing skyrim today, and now im more of a furry  then i was before."
13-12-2018T22:59:14,QuinnMalachite,but that's probably better
13-12-2018T22:59:14,Hg17Lamont2002,Build a city then nuke it with meteors
13-12-2018T22:59:21,ShadowSoap,You a Khajit?
13-12-2018T22:59:22,totallynotTrace,have to go. will probably be back sunday
13-12-2018T22:59:25,HeresyArtStream,"The developer of the flight sim is ""Original Systems."""
13-12-2018T22:59:27,FuryFaZeFurry,yup

13-12-2018T22:59:32,HeresyArtStream,And they bought out Electronic Access

13-12-2018T23:00:02,SageSaga,its odd- i still need to figure out how it looks at things
13-12-2018T23:00:02,unsteddyphoenix,Unfortunate
13-12-2018T23:00:14,Ordithus,I don't think it does look at things
13-12-2018T23:00:14,Hg17Lamont2002,Guess was an awkward placement
13-12-2018T23:00:15,HeresyArtStream,@Twokinds It would be cool to have the hand protruding out of the frame!
13-12-2018T23:00:19,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh wait,"
13-12-2018T23:00:31,unsteddyphoenix,Its all twisting and changing
13-12-2018T23:00:34,unsteddyphoenix,What an art rollercoaster
13-12-2018T23:00:37,Ordithus,Grabby grabby
13-12-2018T23:00:52,HeresyArtStream,I love when stuff pops out of the frame :D
13-12-2018T23:01:08,Hg17Lamont2002,Tom’s got it He just has to find the right “angle” 0.0
13-12-2018T23:01:38,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I think thats what he's going for
13-12-2018T23:01:42,unsteddyphoenix,Its gonna look siiick~
13-12-2018T23:01:43,HeresyArtStream,yayz
13-12-2018T23:01:54,Hg17Lamont2002,He’s got it 👏🏽
13-12-2018T23:02:05,Twokinds,This is why I don't usually stream my sketching of each comic page
13-12-2018T23:02:15,Twokinds,Because I usually spend hours tweeking it
13-12-2018T23:02:20,Twokinds,And it's probably not that interesting
13-12-2018T23:02:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,still fun to watch
13-12-2018T23:02:27,Ordithus,It actually is
13-12-2018T23:02:35,Hg17Lamont2002,Agreed Marv
13-12-2018T23:02:36,ShadowSoap,It's cool seeing the design come together
13-12-2018T23:02:37,Ordithus,"But, for a different reason"
13-12-2018T23:02:38,unsteddyphoenix,"Are you kidding? This ""will he wont he"" is driving me wild~"
13-12-2018T23:02:40,FuryFaZeFurry,thats what i do when im just sketching... it sucks
13-12-2018T23:02:41,Bgrmystr2,"I Dunno, I think it's interesting"
13-12-2018T23:02:50,QuinnMalachite,"This is going to be one of those pages that everyone else loves because it came out great, but Tom hates because it took so much work"
13-12-2018T23:02:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,its neat to see how you come up with the layout
13-12-2018T23:03:00,Bgrmystr2,watching the decision-making process is one of the draws of the stream
13-12-2018T23:03:05,Bgrmystr2,least imo
13-12-2018T23:03:29,Hg17Lamont2002,Patience is key even if it takes hours
13-12-2018T23:03:50,HeresyArtStream,yep
13-12-2018T23:03:52,Ordithus,"Days, weeks, months"
13-12-2018T23:04:04,Hg17Lamont2002,Exactly

13-12-2018T23:04:26,Hg17Lamont2002,In the end it will come out perfectly to the way you want to see it
13-12-2018T23:04:28,QuinnMalachite,"Measure twice, cut once"
13-12-2018T23:04:29,ShadowSoap,I'm just sketching out maps will taking peeks at what he's doing and chatting occasionally

13-12-2018T23:20:21,unsteddyphoenix,Hey no problem at all.
13-12-2018T23:20:32,unsteddyphoenix,Its already a really cool page
13-12-2018T23:20:37,Ordithus,"Curious, how long does a ""typical"" page take to sketch?"
13-12-2018T23:20:43,Hg17Lamont2002,Wdym Tom it’s beautiful bud
13-12-2018T23:20:44,Bgrmystr2,"this is lookin nice, tom"
13-12-2018T23:21:38,Hg17Lamont2002,Was just bout to ask if color and lining get added during this stream but that answers my question
13-12-2018T23:22:35,Bgrmystr2,"generally yes he lines, colors, and shades every time he streams a comic page"
13-12-2018T23:22:50,Bgrmystr2,he puts the text too.. bout 60-70% of the time
13-12-2018T23:22:55,Ordithus,The sketching has been a more recent treat
13-12-2018T23:23:10,Bgrmystr2,"sometimes he leaves the text out and leaves us guessing, the tease :ptv-ohmy::ptv-pouty:"
13-12-2018T23:23:51,HeresyArtStream,yeah sometimes
13-12-2018T23:24:13,HeresyArtStream,Lettering is also a slow and tedious process that isn't really all that fun to watch.
13-12-2018T23:24:29,Hg17Lamont2002,Lol doesn’t he post it to the twokinds website with the text
13-12-2018T23:24:39,HeresyArtStream,yeah
13-12-2018T23:24:49,HeresyArtStream,there are textless versions you can look at too.
13-12-2018T23:24:58,Ordithus,But he makes us wait for the payoff
13-12-2018T23:25:00,HeresyArtStream,My current comic has pretty much no text in it so there's no lettering for me to stream. :P
13-12-2018T23:25:03,Hg17Lamont2002,I’ve seen
