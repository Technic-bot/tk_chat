16-09-2018T01:00:13,MrEase,"the last she saw of him, he was chasing flora, but that was only to give her her papers to free her"

16-09-2018T01:01:09,MrEase,"the guy has been nothing but nice, albeit a bit agressive when he tried to (justifiably) arrest trace, and the characters kinda treat him like shit"
16-09-2018T01:01:14,ItsActuallyKopyKat,teddy seems to think it means something else
16-09-2018T01:01:15,Dadrobit,"That's the coat you put on to keep the decorative part visible, but protected."
16-09-2018T01:01:22,Bgrmystr2,"Disagree, Ease, it wasn't unjustified. Flora was clearly afraid of the guy"

16-09-2018T01:34:02,Dadrobit,Don't think I have Nero's chat.
16-09-2018T01:34:05,Bgrmystr2,"oh, so it could be based on whether it's currectly a ""bot"" or not according to the website connection.. hmm"

16-09-2018T01:36:16,Bgrmystr2,"do you have to do it every time the bot starts up, iliar?"

16-09-2018T01:37:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,speak to me sleepy boy
16-09-2018T01:37:48,Dadrobit,Maybe I'll even read you a bedtime story
16-09-2018T01:39:14,iliar,Yes and no. JWT token generated every time when bot connecting to chat. But I no need set it manual. I set this parameter into code.
16-09-2018T01:42:31,iliar,It would be easier to say RTFM and send link to Picarto API... But you need a lot of vodka to read this shit. Picarto API is an example of terrible documentation.

16-09-2018T15:00:39,CrimsonQuill,Ok.
16-09-2018T15:00:46,Twokinds,Magic is made of wood
16-09-2018T15:00:59,CrimsonQuill,So the DOctor's sonic wouldn't work.
16-09-2018T15:01:20,CrimsonQuill,What if you gave the Doctor Mana crystals?
16-09-2018T15:02:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Magic is only made of wood if your not skilled enough to cast without a wand
16-09-2018T15:02:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Only other book I’d recommend is The Great Gatsby
16-09-2018T15:02:44,CrimsonQuill,I can recommend all of Terry Pratchett's books.
16-09-2018T15:02:49,SpazztasticKiwi,That one takes brain power though and doesn’t click with many
16-09-2018T15:03:06,CrimsonQuill,But it does have a great assortment of characters.
16-09-2018T15:03:16,Twokinds,He'd probably find some way to reverse the polarity of the magic's lenticular flow matrix to fix whatever the problem was.
16-09-2018T15:03:16,CrimsonQuill,And takes a good hard look at all of us.
16-09-2018T15:03:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Though there’s also the Arcane Chronicles. Dystopian future with the tarot cards as characters with powers
16-09-2018T15:03:45,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s a love triangle though so..
16-09-2018T15:03:46,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds I know a John Pertwee quote when I see one. Nicely done TOm!
16-09-2018T15:04:02,CrimsonQuill,I'm not sure about Arcane chronicles....
16-09-2018T15:04:08,CrimsonQuill,Maybe...
16-09-2018T15:04:19,CrimsonQuill,I am at the moment reading a VERY thick history book.
16-09-2018T15:04:24,CrimsonQuill,ANd five webcomics.
16-09-2018T15:06:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Well the newest book of the Arcane Chronicles came out this year and I haven’t read it. I’m really interested but the Team Jack/Team Aric mess is OLD
16-09-2018T15:06:54,CrimsonQuill,Ok.
16-09-2018T15:06:56,CrimsonQuill,brb
16-09-2018T15:08:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Neither one are really good. To me they’re both kinda dicks. But the ideas behind the rest of the plot is cool
16-09-2018T15:13:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Or maybe I got suckered in with the inclusion of the Tarot. But right now that’s the only few books I’d think to try - I like em. Unless you want to try a John Green “tear your heart out and stomp on it” story
16-09-2018T15:15:11,CrimsonQuill,Maybe...
16-09-2018T15:15:25,CrimsonQuill,"Of course, I need to read what I'm reading too..."
16-09-2018T15:15:32,CrimsonQuill,I have far too many books.
16-09-2018T15:23:15,ThingsAreMoving,There's no such thing as 'too many books'
16-09-2018T15:24:00,ThingsAreMoving,unless you're moving houses
16-09-2018T15:24:26,CrimsonQuill,"Unfortunately, ther is such thing if you don't read them."
16-09-2018T15:24:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m still collecting books I don’t read
16-09-2018T15:25:01,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s called wishful thinking
16-09-2018T15:25:13,ThingsAreMoving,I've read all of the books I currently have under my roof
16-09-2018T15:25:22,ThingsAreMoving,some of them several times
16-09-2018T15:25:39,CrimsonQuill,My ambition is to have almost every book I buy from now on to be hardback.
16-09-2018T15:25:45,CrimsonQuill,Unless it's Manga.
16-09-2018T15:25:51,CrimsonQuill,Which are all paperback.
16-09-2018T15:26:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I mostly have books I read already and just wanted a copy for myself
16-09-2018T15:26:14,CrimsonQuill,"To that effect, all my TK books are oversized hardcovers,"
16-09-2018T15:26:23,CrimsonQuill,But vol. 4 hasn't shipped out yet.
16-09-2018T15:26:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Reread Gatsby a few times now
16-09-2018T15:26:58,CrimsonQuill,'The Eagle of the Ninth' by Rosemary Sutcliffe is a tremendous read.
16-09-2018T15:27:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Blood and Chocolate was interesting but the movie didn’t follow the book (shocker)
16-09-2018T15:27:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Silver Eyes made me want to throw the book
16-09-2018T15:28:08,SpazztasticKiwi,In a volcano
16-09-2018T15:28:55,CrimsonQuill,'Silver eyes' makes me think of the FNaF book that was apparently written.
16-09-2018T15:29:21,SpazztasticKiwi,And the John Green books I have make me want to do the same to them
16-09-2018T15:53:51,CommanderTrace,hi whats up?
16-09-2018T16:17:04,Twokinds,yo whatup
16-09-2018T16:17:56,SpazztasticKiwi,My blood pressure
16-09-2018T16:19:03,CommanderTrace,"i'm fine, tom?"
16-09-2018T16:22:14,CommanderTrace,you?
16-09-2018T16:23:33,Twokinds,I'm good
16-09-2018T16:24:22,SpazztasticKiwi,My two day streak of getting no errors in my quick quizzes is ruined
16-09-2018T16:25:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Minor detail all things considered. Still got the rest of my day. What’re y’all doing
16-09-2018T16:30:10,CommanderTrace,"Tom Your father is from germany, can you speak a little german? I've always wanted to know that xD"
16-09-2018T16:31:54,Twokinds,ja
16-09-2018T16:32:21,Dadrobit,gesundheit
16-09-2018T16:32:50,CommanderTrace,nice xD
16-09-2018T16:33:53,CommanderTrace,And what about mark?
16-09-2018T16:37:13,Twokinds,No
16-09-2018T16:37:29,CommanderTrace,ok
16-09-2018T16:38:00,CommanderTrace,Do you think it's a hard language?
16-09-2018T16:44:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve heard Mark say “scheiße”
16-09-2018T16:44:49,CommanderTrace,xD
16-09-2018T16:47:26,CommanderTrace,mark is a german expert:joy:
16-09-2018T16:49:10,Twokinds,German's not very different from english
16-09-2018T16:49:19,Twokinds,At least compared to the differences between Korean and English
16-09-2018T16:50:22,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s plenty of conjugates
16-09-2018T16:50:52,CommanderTrace,yes
16-09-2018T16:51:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Thinking of trying it?
16-09-2018T16:51:53,CommanderTrace,i?
16-09-2018T16:51:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Yes
16-09-2018T16:52:06,ThingsAreMoving,"CommanderTrace is a german, Kiwi"
16-09-2018T16:52:40,CommanderTrace,yes xD
16-09-2018T16:52:46,ThingsAreMoving,Also learning more languages is always a good thing
16-09-2018T16:52:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Just not all at once
16-09-2018T16:52:58,ThingsAreMoving,even just some words
16-09-2018T16:53:14,SpazztasticKiwi,One reason why I’m waiting to restart my Spanish
16-09-2018T16:53:48,ThingsAreMoving,I'm trying to restart (again) my python learning
16-09-2018T16:55:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"Knowing what I do of Spanish, “es” can be confusing cause in Spanish, es=is but in German es=it"
16-09-2018T16:56:42,ThingsAreMoving,es es correct
16-09-2018T16:56:49,ThingsAreMoving,"three languages there, wooo"
16-09-2018T16:57:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Practice is your friend
16-09-2018T16:57:35,ThingsAreMoving,I've heard duolingo is pretty good for getting through the basics
16-09-2018T16:58:17,ThingsAreMoving,and once you have the basics just start watching spanish tv shows with spanish subtitles on neflix
16-09-2018T16:58:37,ThingsAreMoving,"as you said, practice."
16-09-2018T16:58:37,SpazztasticKiwi,It is but it doesn’t explain the rules of why some things are done. That’s when my notes and google become friends
16-09-2018T16:58:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m gonna go on in for closing now. Got me till 10 again
16-09-2018T16:59:29,ThingsAreMoving,o/
16-09-2018T16:59:53,ThingsAreMoving,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
16-09-2018T17:00:50,CommanderTrace,i like german  but there are things that are difficult like konjunktiv
16-09-2018T17:11:16,CommanderTrace,no idea if you know this xD

16-09-2018T23:01:43,SpazztasticKiwi,*track
16-09-2018T23:03:20,BadFoMo,Is it weird if I was having the same idea?
16-09-2018T23:33:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Nope it’s a perfectly cute idea
16-09-2018T23:38:40,Ordithus,Maybe even an adorable one
16-09-2018T23:49:04,TheBeckoner,Just started watching My Hero Academia...it's pretty good
