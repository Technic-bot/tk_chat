31-05-2018T17:06:16,Dadrobit,"You know, you'd think an online class wouldn't require a bunch of hand written homework... You'd be wrong...."
31-05-2018T17:07:30,Dadrobit,This class has some deceptive amounts of homework.
31-05-2018T17:07:42,Dadrobit,All I need to do is problems 1-5.
31-05-2018T17:08:05,Dadrobit,Except each problem has subsection a-p.
31-05-2018T17:09:44,Dadrobit,"It' not hard work necessarily, just tedious as all get out."

31-05-2018T20:43:54,CrRAR,you ok?
31-05-2018T20:44:02,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
31-05-2018T20:46:48,Vatruvius,"I am struggling with getting things down for my own comic. Came to me in a dream a while back and I have decided to act on it. Thing is, all my dream gave me was three characters, no names, and a loose setting."
31-05-2018T20:47:22,Vatruvius,Not much of a story arch either.
31-05-2018T20:50:49,SpotTheLeopard,"haha, same for me on the whole 'comic idea from a dream' thing. Mine had some kind of competition with nonsensical objectives. But I got to kickflip a zombie in the face and it felt so real"
31-05-2018T20:52:05,Matth3w23,Anybody had a lucid dream here? Never had one myself.
31-05-2018T20:52:21,Vatruvius,"My ""comic"" dream didn't even have me in it. Though the closet person in the dream to me would have been the villain."
31-05-2018T20:52:38,Vatruvius,"And it was just once scene, like a literal one or maybe two pages to a comic."
31-05-2018T20:52:50,Vatruvius,Non that I can remember Matt
31-05-2018T20:52:57,Vatruvius,None*
31-05-2018T20:53:10,Matth3w23,Is being close to the villain good or bad?
31-05-2018T20:53:22,Matth3w23,Some villains can be quite cool.
31-05-2018T20:53:31,SpotTheLeopard,"yes to the lucid dreaming, the zombie face-kicking being one instance. Most other times while riding in the car."
31-05-2018T20:53:58,Matth3w23,Sounds like a great dream 😂
31-05-2018T20:54:20,Twokinds,brb restarting
31-05-2018T20:54:26,SpotTheLeopard,"One such case where walking in the woods in the dream, I tripped over a branch - my knee reflexively jerked up and I woke myself up"
31-05-2018T20:54:28,Matth3w23,"Wait, were you in the car in your dream, or while dreaming?"
31-05-2018T20:54:29,Vatruvius,The villain is pretty cool Matt
31-05-2018T20:54:44,Matth3w23,See ya in a few Tom.
31-05-2018T20:54:52,Vatruvius,Kind of a projection of myself if I were a villain. B. A. D. A. S. S.
31-05-2018T20:55:05,Matth3w23,"Wahey, that's good then 😛"
31-05-2018T20:55:19,SpotTheLeopard,"I was riding in the car. I don't sleep well in vehicles, so it triggers the lucid dreaming state somehow"
31-05-2018T20:55:46,Vatruvius,"I use to have dreams when I was younger where I was just falling and right as I ""hit"" the ground I would wake up with a jolt in my bed as if I actually fell."
31-05-2018T20:56:00,Matth3w23,"I remember one dreaming I was in school, and because they were taking the register in my dream, I woke up in the middle of the night and shouted ""here! ""..."
31-05-2018T20:56:27,Vatruvius,lol
31-05-2018T20:56:31,Matth3w23,"He, that's a classic dream vat"
31-05-2018T20:56:42,Vatruvius,So I have heard.
31-05-2018T20:56:58,Vatruvius,Still don't meet much people that say they have had that type of dream.
31-05-2018T20:57:36,Vatruvius,"Well, I got a good portion of my comic down. All I need to do now is refine it a bunch and figure out a story."
31-05-2018T20:57:41,Vatruvius,A good summer project.
31-05-2018T20:57:43,SpotTheLeopard,my 'back in school' nightmare is always that I've accidentally sat through the wrong class and don't discover until the end of the period
31-05-2018T20:58:04,Matth3w23,"Well, good luck with your comic!"
31-05-2018T20:58:06,Vatruvius,Probably should practice drawing so I could actually create comic pages.
31-05-2018T20:58:20,Vatruvius,Thanks.
31-05-2018T20:58:23,Vatruvius,Time to get some food.

31-05-2018T21:12:56,Vatruvius,"Detroit looks amazing, still pisses me off that some of these games are PS only. Come on! :ptv-angry:"
31-05-2018T21:13:16,unsteddyphoenix,yeah I feel that
31-05-2018T21:13:32,SageSaga,it has to be PS only- how else would you do those quicktime events - oh- wait- nm
31-05-2018T21:13:45,Vatruvius,"If anything, PC deserves exclusives over anything else."
31-05-2018T21:13:57,SageSaga,that's just plain not true
31-05-2018T21:14:00,Matth3w23,#mobilegamimgforthewin...
31-05-2018T21:14:06,ItsActuallyKopyKat,anyone hyped for Fallout 76? I feel bad for any other games that released teasers for their games recently
31-05-2018T21:14:08,Matth3w23,*gaming
31-05-2018T21:14:21,Vatruvius,"Maybe, but PS seems to hold onto these great titles just for themselves."
31-05-2018T21:14:29,SageSaga,Pokemon destroyed Fallout76
31-05-2018T21:14:31,Matth3w23,My brother is Kopy
31-05-2018T21:14:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I want to know more about Fallout 76 before I hype
31-05-2018T21:14:41,Twokinds,"I'm a huge fallout fan, but I'm on ""wait and see"" mode"
31-05-2018T21:14:42,ItsActuallyKopyKat,hmmm
31-05-2018T21:14:49,Vatruvius,I believe some of that content is something that all or most gamers deserve to experience.
31-05-2018T21:14:52,Twokinds,I'm concerned about the multiplayer rumors
31-05-2018T21:14:54,ItsActuallyKopyKat,I heard it was going to be online.... soo....
31-05-2018T21:14:55,ItsActuallyKopyKat,yeah
31-05-2018T21:15:00,ZRO4825,From what I've seen NONE of the Fallout fans are happy with what they're hearing about 76
31-05-2018T21:15:05,Combak,Stream!
31-05-2018T21:15:11,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Like...it's an interesting idea and I want to see what they;re doing with it
31-05-2018T21:15:11,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah im hearing that too
31-05-2018T21:15:18,Vatruvius,"Ohh yeah, Fallout76 is a MMO I believe."
31-05-2018T21:15:19,CrimsonHelsing,rumors actually now talk of online being optional
31-05-2018T21:15:23,IntenseParagon,Thats a fanbase for ya
31-05-2018T21:15:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,the multiplayer if true will be more drop in drop out co-op
31-05-2018T21:15:28,CrimsonHelsing,"singleplayer first, co-op optional"
31-05-2018T21:15:37,ItsActuallyKopyKat,that'd be great
31-05-2018T21:15:47,Matth3w23,Seems like many people have fallen out with fallout.
31-05-2018T21:15:57,MviluUatusun,"Well, I'm going to head off to bed.  I'll see y'all Sunday, those of you who'll be here anyway.  LOL."
31-05-2018T21:16:02,Vatruvius,"From what I here, it is nothing like Fallout 4, you will not be in some great single player world. It is more multiplayer like ESO was."
31-05-2018T21:16:03,unsteddyphoenix,Why use part of your budget for multiplayer though. It's just weird.
31-05-2018T21:16:03,CrimsonHelsing,xD
31-05-2018T21:16:05,ZRO4825,"Take care, Mvilu~"

31-05-2018T21:16:51,MviluUatusun,Y'all take care until next time.
31-05-2018T21:16:57,Ordithus,Hmm maybe I should play fallout 4 one of these days...
31-05-2018T21:16:58,SageSaga,by Bethesda standards we JUST had Fallout 4
31-05-2018T21:17:00,unsteddyphoenix,"Sequels are generally a ""want"" not a ""need"""
31-05-2018T21:17:07,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"also, that^"
31-05-2018T21:17:12,SageSaga,it's time for ES5
31-05-2018T21:17:22,IntenseParagon,Still waiting for half life 3
31-05-2018T21:17:23,ItsActuallyKopyKat,they just keep releasing dlc for ESO
31-05-2018T21:17:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,or starfield
31-05-2018T21:17:26,Ordithus,6 you mean sage
31-05-2018T21:17:35,unsteddyphoenix,Skyrim isnt on my toaster yet
31-05-2018T21:17:37,ItsActuallyKopyKat,rip sage
31-05-2018T21:17:40,SageSaga,ESO is not real
31-05-2018T21:17:40,unsteddyphoenix,We still got a ways to go
31-05-2018T21:17:50,Ordithus,Skyrim was 5
31-05-2018T21:17:54,Ordithus,"Twice, even"
31-05-2018T21:17:58,Vatruvius,"All I want to know is what are the two things Bethesda said they are working on before they even touch TES VI and Fallout 5, what is it!? Making a new engine or what? All I need is just a tiny little bit of information so I can be satisfied waiting"
31-05-2018T21:18:00,Vatruvius,five more years.
31-05-2018T21:18:03,SageSaga,yeah i know i was getting to that
31-05-2018T21:18:10,ZRO4825,ESO ain't a real ES imo. And I'm not even a huge ES fan. &gt;:(
31-05-2018T21:18:23,SageSaga,ESO isnt by Bethesda
31-05-2018T21:18:40,ItsActuallyKopyKat,And then there's that
31-05-2018T21:18:46,IntenseParagon,We 'need' a Doom sequel
31-05-2018T21:18:53,Cowkingjavi,:ctwokinds-keith8D:
31-05-2018T21:19:00,SageSaga,we just had a Doom!
31-05-2018T21:19:01,Vatruvius,"That is true, I tried ESO and it just does not capture the TES franchise that well."
31-05-2018T21:19:11,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: tom what did you do to Keith
31-05-2018T21:19:14,Matth3w23,Final final doom?
31-05-2018T21:19:16,Vatruvius,"Only the setting and the lore, not the game play or anything else."
31-05-2018T21:19:33,IntenseParagon,What happened to that new quake game
31-05-2018T21:19:44,Combak,"Coming soon, I think."
31-05-2018T21:19:51,ZRO4825,"Quake Champions, you mean"
31-05-2018T21:19:53,ZRO4825,?*
31-05-2018T21:19:53,Vatruvius,"I think Doom is pretty good, still it. We do not need a sequel to that game for a long while."
31-05-2018T21:20:03,ZRO4825,DOOM 2016 was actually fun as hell.
31-05-2018T21:20:04,Twokinds,Prey DLC hype
31-05-2018T21:20:24,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Prey was excellent
31-05-2018T21:20:25,Vatruvius,"Is there DLC, I have not even gotten to play the game that much yet."
31-05-2018T21:20:32,ItsActuallyKopyKat,:ctwokinds-floAAA::ctwokinds-floAAA:
31-05-2018T21:20:36,Vatruvius,I know!
31-05-2018T21:20:48,SageSaga,we had that leaker on Reddit saying Fallout Vault 76 was not going to be MMO or Rust like but would rely heavily on the Building mechanics presented in Fallout 4
31-05-2018T21:20:49,Vatruvius,"Blame my keyboard, it is still broke."
31-05-2018T21:20:52,ZRO4825,"If there's DLC to DOOM, then I have a reason to reinstall that..."
31-05-2018T21:20:54,Combak,"Eh, IDK... DOOM 2016 demands a sequel. But they had better take their time and make it just as good as the game that spawned it."
31-05-2018T21:21:01,SageSaga,and would be co-op
31-05-2018T21:21:02,ZoieFalcona,*peeks in*  Hi Sage
31-05-2018T21:21:09,IntenseParagon,They need to show off borderlands 3
31-05-2018T21:21:09,CrimsonHelsing,"hmm, who's that walking past Rose on her left on the last panel"
31-05-2018T21:21:14,SageSaga,yo Zoie
31-05-2018T21:21:28,Combak,It definitely looked like it used some stuff from Fallout 4's Vault building DLC.
31-05-2018T21:21:36,Matth3w23,That moment when you have no idea what everybody is talking about because your pc can't run any of these games...
31-05-2018T21:21:43,Ordithus,"Probably Keith, Crimson"
31-05-2018T21:21:44,Vatruvius,Metro Exodus hype!
31-05-2018T21:21:47,Combak,... But that was a pretty standard set of pieces to begin with.

31-05-2018T21:47:18,Vatruvius,"Hmm...if I get anywhere with my comic idea and actually start drawing it, should I have a Tom and Sage cameo in it? Would either of you be for or against that?"
31-05-2018T21:47:28,Ordithus,Paper cuts in bed don't sound pleasant
31-05-2018T21:49:29,Twokinds,I don't mind.
31-05-2018T21:49:37,Vatruvius,There's one.

31-05-2018T21:52:49,SpotTheLeopard,not having to cook another night is a great silver lining

31-05-2018T21:54:06,SageSaga,nope
31-05-2018T21:54:08,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Hi! No i do not!
31-05-2018T21:54:30,Vatruvius,It has only been like a day Foen
31-05-2018T21:54:36,DanaTheBabyFox,Well has been few months since ive had internet so may be why
31-05-2018T21:54:38,Vatruvius,One night.
31-05-2018T21:54:49,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"well, welcome back Dana!"
31-05-2018T21:55:01,Vatruvius,"Yes, welcome back."
31-05-2018T21:55:15,DanaTheBabyFox,I really like twokinds art style
31-05-2018T21:55:19,SpotTheLeopard,not enough crazy antics for two week span
31-05-2018T21:55:21,Vatruvius,"And Sage, would you be okay with a cameo if I ever get around to my comic?"
31-05-2018T21:55:24,Vatruvius,Or no?
31-05-2018T21:55:31,Foenix,"Nevermind, just checked. Only a day."
31-05-2018T21:55:52,SageSaga,i dunno
31-05-2018T21:55:54,Foenix,"Still, it bothers me that Trace and Rose haven't offered Karen a shirt that fits yet"
31-05-2018T21:55:55,Bgrmystr2,"kopy, why did you make 3 days worth of meals for 2 people.. for ONE meal?"
31-05-2018T21:56:05,Bgrmystr2,I don't..
31-05-2018T21:56:11,Bgrmystr2,I don't get it lol
31-05-2018T21:56:12,Vatruvius,"This would be a crucial part of the comic to just skip 2 weeks, has to be just one day to see all those character interactions."
31-05-2018T21:56:14,SageSaga,you could be making a sex comic! I cant say yes without knowing! I dont wanna end up in your orgy scene!
31-05-2018T21:56:22,unsteddyphoenix,You dont cook a lot so you dont have to cook the next few days?
31-05-2018T21:56:23,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:

31-05-2018T21:56:38,unsteddyphoenix,Inefficient
31-05-2018T21:56:41,ItsActuallyKopyKat,It was a three course meal...and I spent like all day on it
31-05-2018T21:56:42,Bgrmystr2,not true
31-05-2018T21:56:49,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Got dressed up and everything
31-05-2018T21:56:49,Vatruvius,lol...only orgies scenes Sage! :P
31-05-2018T21:56:51,Bgrmystr2,leftovers spoil here SO quickly
31-05-2018T21:56:51,Matth3w23,You mean you don't eat three days worth in one meal?
31-05-2018T21:56:58,SpotTheLeopard,lol. cameo with or without clothes?
31-05-2018T21:57:02,Bgrmystr2,"no matt, I'm not like 300lbs lol"
31-05-2018T21:57:03,Bgrmystr2,xD
31-05-2018T21:57:10,unsteddyphoenix,aww
31-05-2018T21:57:11,Matth3w23,😜
31-05-2018T21:57:11,Vatruvius,"No, it would be very similar to Twokinds. Not the same, but similar."
31-05-2018T21:57:17,Bgrmystr2,though I know ppl who do
31-05-2018T21:57:23,ItsActuallyKopyKat,:T
31-05-2018T21:57:31,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Oh well
31-05-2018T21:57:39,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Now I can eat my feelings lol
31-05-2018T21:57:49,Bgrmystr2,"those are delicious, kopy"
31-05-2018T21:57:50,SageSaga,"if you describe your comic as ""Like twokinds but not twokinds"" you have a lot of work to do"
31-05-2018T21:57:52,Vatruvius,"Don't do that, you cannot get them back!"
31-05-2018T21:57:53,Bgrmystr2,would recommend
31-05-2018T21:57:54,unsteddyphoenix,Sometimes it's nice to get dressed up and eat icecream from the tub on your couch
31-05-2018T21:57:56,Matth3w23,You could always do sage as a plant if they don't want a huge cameo. Probably a herb would be best.
31-05-2018T21:58:05,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Exactly, Teddy"
31-05-2018T21:58:10,unsteddyphoenix,"Guy wakes up with amnesia, sees a cute tiger girl..."
31-05-2018T21:58:17,unsteddyphoenix,thats all so far
31-05-2018T21:58:25,Vatruvius,It is the simplest way I can describe it. My idea of my comic is that it is innocent like Twokinds is if you could say it like that.
31-05-2018T21:58:29,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"I got my mint chip next to me, and cookies and cream in the fridge"
31-05-2018T21:58:35,Vatruvius,But other than that it is completely different.
31-05-2018T21:58:37,unsteddyphoenix,Niiiice
31-05-2018T21:58:43,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Fallout NV on the projector
31-05-2018T21:58:53,CrRAR,awww yeah mint chip
31-05-2018T21:59:15,SageSaga,"""Turns out shes not a tiger girl- she's a tiger, he just has a head injury and just sees all animals as anthros- but it doesnt last long because the tiger eats him. good story"""
31-05-2018T21:59:21,Vatruvius,"I have to lay off the mint chip, time to let some of it fall off."
31-05-2018T21:59:24,CrRAR,only thing better is mint WITH the oreo cookies
31-05-2018T21:59:26,Ordithus,"Very short, too."
31-05-2018T21:59:41,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Heck yeah, CrRar"
31-05-2018T21:59:42,unsteddyphoenix,Simple but effective
31-05-2018T21:59:47,SpotTheLeopard,TwoKinds - a different universe
31-05-2018T21:59:51,CrRAR,yis
31-05-2018T22:00:38,Matth3w23,TooKind - a universe where hatred and criticism is banned?
31-05-2018T22:00:41,CrRAR,I keep meaning to watch these streams on my projector... somehow I'm too lazy to set it up. xP
31-05-2018T22:00:48,SpotTheLeopard,boiling a story premise down to one sentence is hard though
31-05-2018T22:00:49,Vatruvius,"The best way I can describe my comic would be futuristic, on a future Earth or an alien Earthlike world I have not decided yet, with anthro characters as part of it, and I am shooting for a similar art style as Twokinds but who knows how I will draw"
31-05-2018T22:00:53,Vatruvius,and what it turns into.
31-05-2018T22:01:18,Vatruvius,Nudity will not be a thing or a clever miss as Tom does.
31-05-2018T22:01:19,CrRAR,mmm

31-05-2018T22:03:07,Vatruvius,"Ohh, I know I have a lot to do. I was just asking and would make a note, ""Sage Cameo"" under other stuff to do."
31-05-2018T22:03:12,Vatruvius,I am not thinking it out.
31-05-2018T22:03:17,CrimsonHelsing,"not sure that's keith going up the stairs, ears don't look right. maybe it's just me"

31-05-2018T22:58:04,SpotTheLeopard,that is also why I threw money at Sage when Sage posted their paypal link on their birthday. Trying to remove that negative stigma with my name XD
31-05-2018T22:58:09,JamesBSquirrel3,"Oh! Now hold up, did Tom left over the sketch bakgrounds like stairs?"
31-05-2018T22:58:24,Bgrmystr2,"he's going to add that later, James"

31-05-2018T22:58:45,AnirasPlace,Umm this is a general question for anyone who uses the picarto app. Why doesn't my avatar from the web version of picarto show up when using the app??
31-05-2018T22:59:03,ZRO4825,"Because 1) the app is crap. 2) From the looks of it, your avatar may  not have saved."
31-05-2018T22:59:05,FenceEqualizer,Because the app sucks
31-05-2018T22:59:08,Vatruvius,"It should, mine does. However, the app does not display avatars."
31-05-2018T22:59:16,Bgrmystr2,You don't have an avatar on pc for me
31-05-2018T22:59:16,JamesBSquirrel3,Oh...:neutral_face:
31-05-2018T22:59:20,Vatruvius,So it will be there but the app does not display them.
31-05-2018T22:59:21,Ordithus,"Just checked, Aniras's avatar does exist on pc"
31-05-2018T22:59:23,AnirasPlace,I even logged out and logged back in..
31-05-2018T22:59:27,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"yeah, the mobile app for this is pretty bad"
31-05-2018T22:59:28,Bgrmystr2,"not for me, ord"
31-05-2018T22:59:37,FenceEqualizer,Refresh
31-05-2018T22:59:48,Ordithus,"Sometimes it requires a refresh, then there's the server side of things...."
31-05-2018T22:59:57,Vatruvius,"If you just uploaded an avatar, it will take a while before anyone of us can see it."
31-05-2018T23:00:00,totallynotTrace,I see aniras on pc
31-05-2018T23:00:00,Bgrmystr2,"nope, refreshed and it's still blank"
31-05-2018T23:00:03,Vatruvius,Servers have to update.
31-05-2018T23:00:08,Bgrmystr2,:/
31-05-2018T23:00:09,Ordithus,I have yet to actually see any avatars on mobile
31-05-2018T23:00:25,Vatruvius,Aniras' is the default Picarto avatar for me.
31-05-2018T23:00:33,Bgrmystr2,even went to his streampage and reloaded that
31-05-2018T23:00:37,FenceEqualizer,Mobile doesn't have avatars sadly.
31-05-2018T23:00:39,Ordithus,They always show up as placeholders for me.  Glad I watch on PC usually
31-05-2018T23:00:45,AnirasPlace,Hmm i dont see it on the chat view from the stream..
31-05-2018T23:00:45,Bgrmystr2,and it was default lol
31-05-2018T23:01:03,Bgrmystr2,"oh, it just fixed for me"
31-05-2018T23:01:28,Bgrmystr2,"it's cuz tom didn't refresh the cache yet, aniras"
31-05-2018T23:01:30,Ordithus,"Also, Rose &lt;3"
31-05-2018T23:01:39,Vatruvius,"It use to be a placeholder Ord, if you have not used the app recently or updated it they removed the placeholder. No more avatars."
31-05-2018T23:01:42,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Rose is pretty cool, yes"
31-05-2018T23:01:56,Bgrmystr2,aw vatru

31-05-2018T23:02:31,Vatruvius,They were just crosses last time so they were really bad.
31-05-2018T23:02:49,Ordithus,"Huh, so it is."
31-05-2018T23:02:56,AnirasPlace,Huh. *sighs* oh well...
31-05-2018T23:02:57,Vatruvius,No avatars is better then the placeholder it use to have.
31-05-2018T23:02:57,Bgrmystr2,"ah, nero's back streaming"
31-05-2018T23:03:08,FenceEqualizer,Might as well remove then leave it looking placeholder like I suppose
31-05-2018T23:03:12,Bgrmystr2,mebbe he'll join
31-05-2018T23:03:19,unsteddyphoenix,:O
31-05-2018T23:03:20,AnirasPlace,But yeah. Rose is pretty cool
31-05-2018T23:04:17,Vatruvius,Apparently Rose will fill in Trace's and Maren's relationship history so that will be cool to see.
31-05-2018T23:04:23,Ordithus,I hope she lets her hair down.  How she looked on the cover page was :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
31-05-2018T23:04:24,FenceEqualizer,"Welp back to lurking, friend wants to torture me with league."
31-05-2018T23:04:32,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Yeah ord!
31-05-2018T23:04:38,unsteddyphoenix,Pick kindred you wont
31-05-2018T23:04:42,Vatruvius,I am expecting a slew of Maren suggestions when those pages come out.
31-05-2018T23:04:46,Bgrmystr2,"how do you know that, vatru?"
31-05-2018T23:04:57,FenceEqualizer,I am a terrible jungle
31-05-2018T23:04:59,AnirasPlace,I liked the page where she tried to tell those people they could not enter without trace's permission
31-05-2018T23:05:09,FenceEqualizer,Like my worse role :ptv-shock:
31-05-2018T23:05:11,Vatruvius,"Tom commented on it at some point, cannot remember when."
31-05-2018T23:05:20,Vatruvius,I think it was a surprise stream...
31-05-2018T23:05:24,Vatruvius,Can't remember.
31-05-2018T23:05:30,Ordithus,"I, for one, welcome more Maren"
31-05-2018T23:05:36,JamesBSquirrel3,"And Raine, also others, soon enough."
31-05-2018T23:05:47,ZRO4825,Maren! \[T]/
31-05-2018T23:05:52,Bgrmystr2,"he did say maren and trace's relationship would be explained soon, but did not specify Rose"
31-05-2018T23:06:02,Bgrmystr2,so I'm just wondering where you heard Rose from
31-05-2018T23:06:08,Vatruvius,I have been posting a Maren suggestion the past few sketch streams but it has not been getting voted...
31-05-2018T23:06:12,Vatruvius,:ptv-sad:

31-05-2018T23:06:38,Vatruvius,I could swear he commented Rose would fill in some gaps.
31-05-2018T23:06:43,Vatruvius,I am fairly certain.

31-05-2018T23:07:37,ZRO4825,Karen can't Hulk properly. She isn't wearing stretchy purple pants.

31-05-2018T23:59:36,unsteddyphoenix,"He's said that if the offer was REALLY good he might go back, but up to him"
