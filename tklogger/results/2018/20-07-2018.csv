20-07-2018T00:05:58,Twokinds,Technically.
20-07-2018T00:06:12,Twokinds,"But comic-con has ""Preview Night"" on the 18th"
20-07-2018T00:06:19,Twokinds,So it's actually a 5-day convention
20-07-2018T00:10:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll take your word for it
20-07-2018T00:10:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm honestly not terribly concerned right now
20-07-2018T00:11:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôm playing run around with work and my mother, as usual."
20-07-2018T00:15:22,SpazztasticKiwi,No offense of course. Have good con. Many sights. Lots of wow

20-07-2018T00:29:54,SpazztasticKiwi,And make my bed. And get ready for bed. And try to sleep

20-07-2018T01:59:00,TorqueEmUp,Hell I thought it was strange enough that AC starts on a Thursday.
20-07-2018T01:59:55,TorqueEmUp,"But I guess SDCC needs to do it that way, it's already crowded enough as it is."
20-07-2018T05:48:16,Bgrmystr2,"Eh, I dunno"
20-07-2018T05:48:21,Bgrmystr2,Comiket is 3 days long
20-07-2018T05:48:35,Bgrmystr2,and it's basically the biggest anime expo in the world

20-07-2018T22:38:49,Vatruvius,I drink zero.
20-07-2018T22:41:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Isn‚Äôt that a water bottle brand
20-07-2018T22:41:16,Dadrobit,Also a Coke flavor I think
20-07-2018T22:41:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Coke Zero nasty

20-07-2018T22:44:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Though seriously does anyone else notice the taste difference between diet and regular

20-07-2018T22:45:13,SpazztasticKiwi,We got that. Zero is a water filter company though
20-07-2018T22:45:48,SpazztasticKiwi,But isn‚Äôt it a bottle brand too
20-07-2018T22:45:49,Bgrmystr2,I don't drink alchohol or soda so I'm the last person to talk to :D
20-07-2018T22:46:01,Vatruvius,There is a Coke Zero I believe.
20-07-2018T22:46:12,SpazztasticKiwi,We just tossed that one around
20-07-2018T22:46:32,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs basically diet with a different label and colors
20-07-2018T22:46:48,Vatruvius,Well I just got back so...sorry.
20-07-2018T22:46:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Not a big thing

20-07-2018T22:48:15,Bgrmystr2,that's what would happen.
20-07-2018T22:48:19,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs what I‚Äôd imagine

20-07-2018T22:48:56,Vatruvius,That is a throw back...sheesh.
20-07-2018T22:49:36,Vatruvius,I was not that old when that movie was released and I put far too many hours into the game on my PS2 at the time.
20-07-2018T22:49:52,SpazztasticKiwi,That movie was cute. Made me question a skunk/cat relationship
20-07-2018T22:49:54,Vatruvius,Now I am thinking about the PS2 save slots...
20-07-2018T22:50:15,Vatruvius,I was too young to notice that really. I never rewatched it.
20-07-2018T22:51:14,SpazztasticKiwi,My sister and I watched it
20-07-2018T22:52:58,SpazztasticKiwi,My dad liked it ok. Hammer reminded him of his squirrel hunting I guess
20-07-2018T22:53:06,SpazztasticKiwi,*Hammie
20-07-2018T22:53:51,Vatruvius,Ahh...yes. I love kid movies that remind me of my time...killing...things...uh...
20-07-2018T22:54:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Well to be fair there‚Äôs a lot of hunting and kill-the-animals themes
20-07-2018T22:56:10,Vatruvius,"Well yeah, now that I think about it I suppose there where. I vaguely remember the game employing some very over the top means to kill, I mean knock out, any and all animals spotted in suburbia."

20-07-2018T22:57:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"That lady on the phone: ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm not busy - I‚Äôm just driving‚Äù"
20-07-2018T22:57:56,SpazztasticKiwi,In a neighborhood. What if a kid runs out on their bike or after a toy
20-07-2018T22:57:56,Vatruvius,Bad habit.
20-07-2018T22:58:06,Vatruvius,Exactly.
20-07-2018T22:58:28,Vatruvius,I am always more aware when driving through a neighborhood like that.
20-07-2018T22:58:38,Vatruvius,I could never live with myself if I ran a kid over.
20-07-2018T22:59:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember one day my mom was driving and these kids from my school were playing chicken with the cars
20-07-2018T22:59:28,Vatruvius,Oh my god! Seriously!
20-07-2018T22:59:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Where is your mother and does she know what you‚Äôre doing
20-07-2018T22:59:53,Vatruvius,When they are in high school they will play chicken with trains next.
20-07-2018T23:00:03,SpazztasticKiwi,They‚Äôd wait for a car to get close and then duck and roll in front
20-07-2018T23:00:29,SpazztasticKiwi,We had been wondering why people were tapping their brakes before we got up on them and they did it to us
20-07-2018T23:01:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Thought my mom was going to get out and ‚Äúmom lecture‚Äù them
20-07-2018T23:01:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Or beat them. Not completely sure which
20-07-2018T23:02:01,Vatruvius,"Firstly, if it was a school then I would get a teacher or some school personnel."
20-07-2018T23:02:33,Vatruvius,If I could get no one then perhaps call the local precinct to send over a patrol.
20-07-2018T23:02:37,SpazztasticKiwi,It was a neighborhood area. I knew one of the kids
20-07-2018T23:02:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Idiot
20-07-2018T23:03:06,Vatruvius,"""I knew one of the kids...more's the pitty."
20-07-2018T23:03:09,Vatruvius,""""
20-07-2018T23:03:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I do wonder if anyone ever called the cops. I know they wouldn‚Äôt have been very happy with what they were doing
20-07-2018T23:05:12,Vatruvius,That and the police would certainly set those kids straight or at the very least their parents.
20-07-2018T23:05:31,Vatruvius,If they knew their kids were playing chicken that is.
20-07-2018T23:06:25,Vatruvius,"Also, asian chip manufacturers really should not make commercials for their products. Stick to making the chips, you are better at it."
20-07-2018T23:08:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve seen some Japanese commercials
20-07-2018T23:09:11,SpazztasticKiwi,They‚Äôre weird but get your attention
20-07-2018T23:10:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Side note - anyone heard of a Kia truck
20-07-2018T23:10:15,Vatruvius,Yeah...you could say they get your attention.
20-07-2018T23:10:23,Vatruvius,I heard of Kia...
20-07-2018T23:10:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause I‚Äôve never seen that they have trucks. And Kia is kinda growing on me
20-07-2018T23:16:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"But anyway, while some are ‚Äúwhat did I just witness?‚Äù Others are pretty cool"
20-07-2018T23:18:32,Vatruvius,I have yet to see a cool one.
