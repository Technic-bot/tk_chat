04-07-2018T00:02:09,BadFoMo,Don't forget to pack Sanatary Wipes and use one after touching anyone or anything.
04-07-2018T00:02:25,Ordithus,"haha... wait, he's serious"
04-07-2018T00:02:32,BadFoMo,Yep.
04-07-2018T00:02:46,InTheLionsDen,Especially if they touch you.
04-07-2018T00:03:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Just stay behind a table at all times
04-07-2018T00:03:13,TorqueEmUp,I think that's just good advice for any con-goer

04-07-2018T00:15:28,Dadrobit,Welding gloves for scale lol
04-07-2018T00:16:31,Bgrmystr2,"not gonna lie, looks a little burnt"

04-07-2018T00:17:16,Dadrobit,That's just some of the seasonings on the crispy chicken skin.
04-07-2018T00:17:22,Dadrobit,The skin itself is fine.
04-07-2018T00:17:37,Dadrobit,I think that's the cumin that darkened the most.
04-07-2018T00:17:42,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: alright
04-07-2018T00:17:53,Dadrobit,"But the rest is fine, only cooked for about a half hour."
04-07-2018T00:18:19,Dadrobit,"High temp, short cook time."
04-07-2018T00:18:43,Dadrobit,"gets crispy on the outside, but lets everything stay juicy on the inside."
04-07-2018T00:19:58,Dadrobit,"And because part of the prep is crushing the chest, it lies nice and flat/thin, so everything cooks evenly/quickly."
04-07-2018T00:21:17,Ordithus,":ctwokinds-RainezZz: Sounds tasty, enjoy!  Good night"
04-07-2018T00:21:33,Dadrobit,It was. Cya Ord :)

04-07-2018T01:33:03,DarthRexKing,Night.
04-07-2018T13:28:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Legit question here: I’m emailing a company to close an account with them. Does it make ANY SENSE to anyone else why they’d call me in response?
04-07-2018T13:44:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Nm
04-07-2018T15:13:45,Xexanoth,it's pretty common...
04-07-2018T15:59:01,Bgrmystr2,sometimes yes kiwi
04-07-2018T15:59:07,Bgrmystr2,to confirm you are the real owner of the account
04-07-2018T15:59:35,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s just it doesn’t match the customer service number on the website
04-07-2018T16:15:54,Bgrmystr2,"Dunno if I would trust. Still, it may not always match."
04-07-2018T16:16:06,Bgrmystr2,You can always contact the site support and ask them about it
04-07-2018T16:16:32,Bgrmystr2,I'm sure they'd have no problems verifying the number that called you.
04-07-2018T16:17:22,Bgrmystr2,"cuz if that number is NOT them and is asking about your info, then there's something bad going on"
04-07-2018T16:17:50,Bgrmystr2,cuz someone would have to know that you contacted them and know your number in order to call you back
