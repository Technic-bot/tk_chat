22-09-2018T13:36:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Hey sleep is important too
22-09-2018T14:24:45,js199456,no Stream tonight?
22-09-2018T14:27:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Sage? Dunno. Tom? He‚Äôs currently not in the country
22-09-2018T14:29:54,js199456,great :/
22-09-2018T14:31:42,js199456,well atleast next stream is colour one ^^
22-09-2018T14:31:47,js199456,that makes me happy
22-09-2018T14:43:23,Combak,"Actually, I'm not sure."
22-09-2018T14:43:35,Combak,Coloring streams are normally AFTER the end of the month.
22-09-2018T14:50:49,SpazztasticKiwi,We can try asking if he checks in but I have a feeling they‚Äôre having to wait everyday to go for an internet spot
22-09-2018T14:52:41,CrimsonQuill,"Yep, Mark made it clear in his video."
22-09-2018T15:00:36,JamesBSquirrel3,I on a Polls at the moment.:ptv-pouty:

22-09-2018T15:30:18,MallardDuckAvia,Will there be a stream today?
22-09-2018T15:32:00,Bgrmystr2,puts another nickel in the jar
22-09-2018T15:37:12,Bgrmystr2,it is rather unfortunate that mallard doesn't even bother to stick around after asking his question.
22-09-2018T15:39:01,CrimsonQuill,Marmit.
22-09-2018T15:39:04,CrimsonQuill,Marmite.
22-09-2018T15:39:27,Gundurr,will there be? a stream that is
22-09-2018T15:40:05,Bgrmystr2,No? Where have you been the past few weeks lol
22-09-2018T15:40:35,Bgrmystr2,Tom left on vacation to Korea with Mark on the 19th and will be gone for 2 weeks
22-09-2018T15:41:19,JamesBSquirrel3,2 weeks?! from 19th Sept??
22-09-2018T15:41:36,Bgrmystr2,"James don't act surprised, you were there when it was said. several times"
22-09-2018T15:41:54,Bgrmystr2,"but yes, again."
22-09-2018T15:42:56,JamesBSquirrel3,Oh I didn't know now but it is Tom vacation to Korea with Mark. I get it now! Sorry:ptv-scratch:
22-09-2018T15:43:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"With Mallards case, idk why he didn‚Äôt read my comment literally 4 lines up"
22-09-2018T15:43:40,JamesBSquirrel3,That means I'm off to bed early then.
22-09-2018T15:44:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"Or further, for that matter"
22-09-2018T15:44:11,Bgrmystr2,noone reads the chat.
22-09-2018T15:44:16,Bgrmystr2,xD
22-09-2018T15:44:22,Bgrmystr2,it's a curse we have to deal with.
22-09-2018T15:44:53,CrimsonQuill,Whereas I watch it for hours on end...
22-09-2018T15:45:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I do when I can but most of the time I can only try to join the conversation with what little I see
22-09-2018T15:45:26,JamesBSquirrel3,"See'ya later of October, guys.:upside_down:"
22-09-2018T15:45:29,CrimsonQuill,My problem is mainly that the converstion is outside my time zone.
22-09-2018T15:45:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Like the past two times I‚Äôve missed Tom‚Äôs hellos
22-09-2018T15:46:48,Bgrmystr2,"it's just.. someone randomly joins the chat, asks about the stream.. and doesn't even bother reading a single message above when the conversation that just finished"
22-09-2018T15:46:53,Bgrmystr2,was about the stream.
22-09-2018T15:47:15,Bgrmystr2,"There's a limit to living under a rock, you shouldn't take your rock with you."
22-09-2018T15:47:56,Bgrmystr2,"happens so often, it's unreal"
22-09-2018T15:52:54,SpazztasticKiwi,The internet is so swell huh
22-09-2018T15:54:49,michal1999102,someone knows when it will be stream ?
22-09-2018T15:55:39,CrRAR,No stream until Tom returns from traveling.

22-09-2018T16:03:04,SageSaga,Hoping that works to highlight it
22-09-2018T16:04:01,Gundurr,the boobs are distracting
22-09-2018T16:04:13,SpazztasticKiwi,What boobs
22-09-2018T16:04:24,CrimsonQuill,Why the bouncing assets?!
22-09-2018T16:05:06,SpazztasticKiwi,They are simply bookends to a very simple and pertinent announcement
22-09-2018T16:05:18,CrimsonQuill,Ok...
22-09-2018T16:05:40,michal1999102,well let him rest
22-09-2018T16:06:22,CrimsonQuill,I'm off. There's science to be done my end. Goodnight!
22-09-2018T16:06:28,michal1999102,and for how many days?
22-09-2018T16:06:42,Bgrmystr2,that announcement didn't last 3 mins before it was off-screen.
22-09-2018T16:07:02,Bgrmystr2,"srsly michael, take off your rock for like.. at least 5 mins."
22-09-2018T16:07:14,Bgrmystr2,he's gone for 2 weeks
22-09-2018T16:07:49,SageSaga,:csagesaga-c4: Tom Will be back from Vacation in early October - No Streams till he is back :csagesaga-bounce:

22-09-2018T16:08:30,SpazztasticKiwi,You could do that every hour til he returns and someone‚Äôll still ask
22-09-2018T16:09:01,SageSaga,then we can just point at them and laugh at how stupid they are
22-09-2018T16:09:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Don‚Äôt pull punches :ctwokinds-flomad:

22-09-2018T16:10:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"Well, it‚Äôs like this: it takes a few more seconds to read enough to educate and update yourself and if they don‚Äôt want..."
22-09-2018T16:10:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Shame
22-09-2018T16:11:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I do wonder if they‚Äôll try flying back right at the 2 week mark on Wednesdayish
22-09-2018T16:13:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"But anyway, how‚Äôs it going for you today Sage"
22-09-2018T16:15:32,SageSaga,I got 2 hours of sleep
