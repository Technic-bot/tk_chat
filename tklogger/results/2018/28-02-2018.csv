28-02-2018T00:00:20,RoloArts,"No, they're like pizza"
28-02-2018T00:00:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,#QualityPretzelAestetics
28-02-2018T00:00:33,RoloArts,perfectly cut pizza tastes better
28-02-2018T00:00:54,RoloArts,and round pizzas taste better than square ones
28-02-2018T00:00:59,Dadrobit,"Naw, these are actually still delicious. They will not survive this nige"
28-02-2018T00:01:00,RoloArts,it's science
28-02-2018T00:01:01,Dadrobit,night
28-02-2018T00:01:41,NeonMitsumi,Square pizza? wut
28-02-2018T00:01:45,RoloArts,ikr
28-02-2018T00:01:57,Dadrobit,Papa Johns is notorious for it
28-02-2018T00:02:09,Bgrmystr2,nothing wrong with the shape of a pizza
28-02-2018T00:02:22,Dadrobit,HOWEVER!!! Deep dish rectangle pizza is still amazeballs from other joints
28-02-2018T00:02:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,^
28-02-2018T00:02:39,RoloArts,the square shaped totally throws off the crust/everything else ratio
28-02-2018T00:02:51,Bgrmystr2,..no?
28-02-2018T00:02:51,Sammit,the only advantage of a square pizza is less  likely so get messed up in delivery(because shake less in the box)
28-02-2018T00:02:54,CrimsonHelsing,"Pizza is pizza (well, American pizza anyway)"
28-02-2018T00:03:20,Bgrmystr2,there's the same amount of crust as you would on a round pizza
28-02-2018T00:03:49,Bgrmystr2,"the inside is only a different shape, it doesn't change the ratio"
28-02-2018T00:04:06,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"yeah but with a square one, especially a big one, there are slices that don't have any crust"
28-02-2018T00:04:13,Dadrobit,I think he's talking about how some pizzarias cut them into tiny squares so that the center pices don't get any crust
28-02-2018T00:04:19,Dadrobit,Ninja's
28-02-2018T00:04:26,Bgrmystr2,"well yeah per slice, but"
28-02-2018T00:04:26,Dadrobit,Ninja'd*
28-02-2018T00:04:27,Bgrmystr2,big deal?
28-02-2018T00:04:28,Bgrmystr2,so what
28-02-2018T00:04:32,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Case in point: https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cornerstonepizza.com%2Fphotos%2Ffood13.jpg&imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cornerstonepizza.com%2Ffood13.html&docid=XaPZoMhvzM-BoM&tbnid=jlFAyRbSulFjGM%3A&vet=10ahUKEwim4bnWrMrZAhVCSK0KHUAbDX

28-02-2018T00:04:47,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Rip long link
28-02-2018T00:05:01,RoloArts,Honestly I was just being silly
28-02-2018T00:05:05,ItsActuallyKopyKat,But crust is important in a slice of pizza
28-02-2018T00:05:06,Dadrobit,"It's not a big deal, unless you're talking about price"
28-02-2018T00:05:20,Bgrmystr2,I see literally nothing wrong with that pizza other than the fact that it's not mozzerella cheeze and alfredo sauce.
28-02-2018T00:05:35,Dadrobit,"Even then, I still would pay more for a proper pizza."
28-02-2018T00:05:36,RoloArts,not enough pineapples
28-02-2018T00:05:48,Bgrmystr2,"0 pineapples is enough pineapples, Rolo."
28-02-2018T00:05:54,Dadrobit,#QualityToppings
28-02-2018T00:05:56,NeonMitsumi,I was waiting for pineapples to be mentioned lol
28-02-2018T00:06:05,Bgrmystr2,Zero is an ideal number.
28-02-2018T00:06:09,Sammit,the most important thing about the pizza is its price and quality
28-02-2018T00:06:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,well done pineapples
28-02-2018T00:06:20,Bgrmystr2,agree sammit
28-02-2018T00:06:35,Dadrobit,I actually really do like pineapple on pizza. I think it creates a great contrast.
28-02-2018T00:06:47,RoloArts,^
28-02-2018T00:07:02,RoloArts,like a french fry dipped in a milkshake
28-02-2018T00:07:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom do you like pineapple on pizza?
28-02-2018T00:07:07,Dadrobit,Like oreos with Skittle fillings
28-02-2018T00:07:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,......................................
28-02-2018T00:07:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,nani?
28-02-2018T00:07:24,Twokinds,I don't mind pineapple on pizza.
28-02-2018T00:07:25,Zapheth,pineapple on pizza is great
28-02-2018T00:07:26,RoloArts,like sea-salt caramel anything
28-02-2018T00:07:29,TheBeckoner,"I dont think I would like that, but I do like pineapple pizza"
28-02-2018T00:07:47,Twokinds,"I eat it a lot because my mother likes it. It's certainly not my favorite, but I'm not a picky eater."
28-02-2018T00:07:52,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Hawaiian pizza is pretty good
28-02-2018T00:07:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"I like pineapple, mushroom, ham, olive, and cheese"
28-02-2018T00:08:10,Zapheth,most pizza is good pizza
28-02-2018T00:08:11,Dadrobit,Mushrooms are super hit or miss in my experience
28-02-2018T00:08:23,RoloArts,I dislike olives
28-02-2018T00:08:31,Sammit,i love mushroom
28-02-2018T00:08:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I also like to make it myself if I can. Though I haven’t tried making homemade crust yet
28-02-2018T00:08:42,RoloArts,mushrooms are great
28-02-2018T00:08:42,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"@Zapeth, good point. But not broccoli pizza"
28-02-2018T00:08:49,Zapheth,lmao is that real
28-02-2018T00:08:57,ItsActuallyKopyKat,yeah it is
28-02-2018T00:09:00,Zapheth,I'll try it for the experience
28-02-2018T00:09:03,TheBeckoner,I agree Dadro
28-02-2018T00:09:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Afraid I’ll screw it up
28-02-2018T00:09:05,Zapheth,I enjoy broccoli
28-02-2018T00:09:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I like just plain Jane pepperoni pizza

28-02-2018T00:10:12,Zapheth,I'd give a try
28-02-2018T00:10:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Tom's landscape painting has got me jelly.
28-02-2018T00:10:48,Zapheth,^
28-02-2018T00:11:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,how does one grass like that?
28-02-2018T00:11:18,BadFoMo,He makes it look so ease.
28-02-2018T00:11:25,Dadrobit,"Confirmed, grass is a verb"
28-02-2018T00:11:34,Sammit,it looks like its a part of a golf course
28-02-2018T00:12:00,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Like the shading on that hill... So nice
28-02-2018T00:12:12,Dadrobit,"Allergies, allergies for days..."
28-02-2018T00:12:37,SpazztasticKiwi,“Fore!” *breaks irreplaceable stained glass window*

28-02-2018T00:15:12,BadFoMo,@SpazztasticKiwi Old_Trace: Who did that?! (insert random transformation threat here.)
28-02-2018T00:15:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"But sure, friends. I don’t get out enough to spend time with them, but yeah"
28-02-2018T00:15:29,TheBeckoner,Tom's grass is on point. It always is.
28-02-2018T00:15:47,NeonMitsumi,Damn bright neon green grass
28-02-2018T00:15:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I think the “dat grass/nice grass” joke has died
28-02-2018T00:16:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Or has it?
28-02-2018T00:16:15,TheBeckoner,Not a joke. I actually think the grass looks cool.
28-02-2018T00:16:15,ItsActuallyKopyKat,ehh

28-02-2018T00:16:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe I’m the only one who’s been ruined with the implied removal of the “gr”
28-02-2018T00:17:21,BadFoMo,What kind of a mountan is that on the left?
28-02-2018T00:17:30,TheBeckoner,stabby mountain

28-02-2018T00:19:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I snorted
28-02-2018T00:20:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I just imagine a small hill with a knife now going “come here. I kill you”
28-02-2018T00:20:59,RoloArts,Will we ever get a grand tour of Trace's castle-house?
28-02-2018T00:21:11,Char89TheCharizard,his mansino?

28-02-2018T00:21:48,SpazztasticKiwi,“And that’s all. Any questions?”
28-02-2018T00:21:52,Char89TheCharizard,that was by accident Rolo
28-02-2018T00:21:58,RoloArts,I know
28-02-2018T00:23:49,BadFoMo,Oh. It's a Snow Globe.
28-02-2018T00:23:55,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s looking lovely though - don’t think I’ve said that yet
28-02-2018T00:24:20,RoloArts,maybe that's some sort of magic barrier
28-02-2018T00:24:35,BadFoMo,I'm reminded of the ending of the fan remake of Kings Quest 2.
28-02-2018T00:25:31,TheBeckoner,has returned with brownies

28-02-2018T00:26:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t doubt it
28-02-2018T00:26:05,Char89TheCharizard,So Reni gave Trace a magic staff just to conceal the location of the mansion?
28-02-2018T00:26:13,TheBeckoner,is considering
28-02-2018T00:26:18,SpazztasticKiwi,But it came out so good

28-02-2018T00:35:44,NeonMitsumi,That sheild is to prevent chickens from escaping.
28-02-2018T00:35:46,TheBeckoner,I think that is always there?

28-02-2018T00:48:38,Zakuru,T^T
28-02-2018T00:50:01,CheeseRS,"Don't be sad, even I can't stay for long because I have to prepare myself for school"
28-02-2018T00:50:14,Zakuru,I wanna sleep
28-02-2018T00:50:55,CheeseRS,Just do it. Nothing is impossible. Make your dreams come true.
28-02-2018T00:51:30,Dimensional,Nice. Trace's Manor looks like it's in a glass globe. Just need to shake it to make it snow
28-02-2018T00:51:33,Bgrmystr2,RIP you guys and school :V
28-02-2018T00:51:37,BoxStealthFox,Make dreams come true... lol
28-02-2018T00:51:40,Bgrmystr2,"ikr Dimen, that's what I'm thinking"
28-02-2018T00:52:24,CheeseRS,I need a clay model of the Manor and I need I put into a glass globe with some artificial snow.
28-02-2018T00:53:03,Foenix,How does Rose keep that place clean?
28-02-2018T00:53:05,Foenix,It's so huge.
28-02-2018T00:53:19,CheeseRS,Magic.
28-02-2018T00:53:22,InTheLionsDen,magical Roombas
28-02-2018T00:53:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,She hires people
28-02-2018T00:53:32,NeonMitsumi,When in doubt: Magic
28-02-2018T00:53:43,Dadrobit,"Specifically, the magic of slaves"
28-02-2018T00:53:54,Infinitedge,Oh dear
28-02-2018T00:54:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,if they are made out of clay then they are not people
28-02-2018T00:54:08,CheeseRS,"Oh noes, does Trace still have slaves?"
28-02-2018T00:54:44,Foenix,Probably somewhere.
28-02-2018T00:55:02,Foenix,"But then, Trace was a special case when it came to Keidran."
28-02-2018T00:55:07,CheeseRS,"The basement might be full of surprises, we shall see..."
28-02-2018T00:55:20,Dadrobit,"The third floor is off lmits, that's where the slave pens are."
28-02-2018T00:55:24,Dadrobit,limits
28-02-2018T00:55:44,Foenix,"That's where they're going to teleport into, isn't it?"
28-02-2018T00:56:07,Dimensional,Trace doesn't have slaves. He has prisoners with jobs.
28-02-2018T00:56:09,CheeseRS,But can Trace go there? It's his Manor after all
28-02-2018T00:56:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"There's no mountain dew in the kitchen Trace, maybe you can look in the basement for it"
28-02-2018T00:56:38,CheeseRS,Well that came out of a sudden
28-02-2018T00:57:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"I imagine anyone can go there, but the consequences of doing so may be similar to the front door spell, I’d imagine"
28-02-2018T00:57:40,Dadrobit,"""Where's the Mountain Dew?"" ""In the fridge! Duh!"""
28-02-2018T00:58:04,CheeseRS,"I think you're right, Spazz."
28-02-2018T00:58:43,CheeseRS,Now look at the stream chat. I'm the only one without a profile picture...
28-02-2018T00:58:45,Foenix,I hope Trace gets Karen a new shirt. That's awfully too big for her
28-02-2018T00:59:03,CheeseRS,Maybe Kat can make her one?
28-02-2018T00:59:06,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Just add one :0
28-02-2018T00:59:10,Dadrobit,Just make Karen bigger. Problem solved.
28-02-2018T00:59:19,Infinitedge,Oh dear
28-02-2018T00:59:26,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s a hell of a deterrent: do you really want to risk getting turned into a cow to satisfy your curiosity?
28-02-2018T00:59:29,Char89TheCharizard,not if it turns Karen a giant
28-02-2018T00:59:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD

28-02-2018T01:00:09,CheeseRS,No. I want to risk getting turned into sushi

28-02-2018T01:02:14,CheeseRS,Reni needs to get booped again. We need a KarenxReni ship

28-02-2018T01:18:46,unsteddyphoenix,Nooo~~ I wanted to watch the end~ :ctwokinds-LauraCry:
28-02-2018T01:20:45,BadFoMo,@iliar Well atleast you caught it.
28-02-2018T01:20:56,iliar,And I would like to see everything else except the end. I woke up about an hour ago.
28-02-2018T01:21:50,iliar,"I'm not sure yet. After a while, the processing of the record will finish. Then it will be clear."
28-02-2018T01:22:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t these go up on YouTube later
28-02-2018T01:22:57,BadFoMo,@SpazztasticKiwi That's what iliar does.
28-02-2018T01:23:04,Twokinds,D:
28-02-2018T01:23:28,Twokinds,That's weird
28-02-2018T01:23:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Well then.
28-02-2018T01:23:43,Twokinds,Nothing technical went wrong. That's weird.
28-02-2018T01:23:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Technology: giving us the middle finger since it’s development
28-02-2018T01:24:31,BadFoMo,Well I've got 'a' version atleast.
28-02-2018T01:24:42,unsteddyphoenix,That'' teach me for missing the stream for something as unimportant as FOOD.
28-02-2018T01:25:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I missed a bit at the end there to wash and blow dry my hair
28-02-2018T01:25:34,SpazztasticKiwi,So you’re not alone there
28-02-2018T01:25:52,unsteddyphoenix,solidarity~
28-02-2018T01:26:18,iliar,@Twokinds This is not your problem. Sometimes Picarto does strange things with records.
28-02-2018T01:27:00,Dadrobit,:( My pretzals are finished.
28-02-2018T01:27:05,TheBeckoner,Tell it to get into digital media instead.
28-02-2018T01:27:12,Dadrobit,Our time together was so short
28-02-2018T01:27:21,TheBeckoner,Make more?
28-02-2018T01:27:36,Dadrobit,"I could make more, but, that's like 20 minutes of effort"
28-02-2018T01:27:43,unsteddyphoenix,"Pretzels gone, despair sinks in"
28-02-2018T01:27:48,unsteddyphoenix,Agreed unacceptable
28-02-2018T01:28:10,TheBeckoner,Tell someone else to make more?
28-02-2018T01:28:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Tell my wifi I loved her...
28-02-2018T01:28:37,Dadrobit,Though I could definitely use the practice in folding them. My pretzal folds kinda sucked
28-02-2018T01:29:06,Dadrobit,And just making pretzal balls is kind of a cop ut
28-02-2018T01:29:07,TheBeckoner,as long as you get pretzel flavored dough you're good.
28-02-2018T01:29:09,Dadrobit,out*
28-02-2018T01:29:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Why not make your own shapes
28-02-2018T01:29:34,TheBeckoner,when they taste like shit is when youre in trouble.
28-02-2018T01:29:59,TheBeckoner,what kind flavor were they?
28-02-2018T01:30:00,Dadrobit,My food never tastes like shit I'll have you know!
28-02-2018T01:30:07,Dadrobit,Except for that one time
28-02-2018T01:30:20,TheBeckoner,what was the one time?
28-02-2018T01:30:21,Dadrobit,Flavor? Pretzal flavor.
28-02-2018T01:30:29,Dadrobit,With salt
28-02-2018T01:30:31,unsteddyphoenix,Dont ask about that one itme
28-02-2018T01:30:31,TheBeckoner,I mean like cinnamon or something
28-02-2018T01:30:53,TheBeckoner,but I guess they were plain.
28-02-2018T01:30:55,Dadrobit,"Naw, I kept it simple. Flour, yeast, water, brown sugar."
28-02-2018T01:31:12,Dadrobit,"boil for 45 seconds, then bake until baked"

28-02-2018T01:31:38,TheBeckoner,Food is base of human operating

28-02-2018T01:36:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Who cares? This is English
28-02-2018T01:36:52,Dadrobit,cares
28-02-2018T01:37:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Then you spell check him
28-02-2018T01:37:44,Dadrobit,Effort
28-02-2018T01:38:00,unsteddyphoenix,Beck you got it right gold star
28-02-2018T01:38:00,TheBeckoner,So you care neutrally?
28-02-2018T01:38:09,TheBeckoner,Thank birbman
28-02-2018T01:38:49,Dadrobit,"I care enough to judge, but not correct."
28-02-2018T01:39:40,unsteddyphoenix,"I was elected to LEAD, not to READ."
28-02-2018T01:39:59,TheBeckoner,Nice
28-02-2018T01:40:18,TheBeckoner,I make word bits with letter bits on pushy button board
28-02-2018T01:41:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"When in doubt, google it"
28-02-2018T01:42:43,TheBeckoner,that's gross.
28-02-2018T01:43:04,SpazztasticKiwi,It can be
28-02-2018T01:43:29,Dadrobit,Use Bing for performance
28-02-2018T01:44:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t care what platform it is if I just get the right answer
28-02-2018T01:48:46,TheBeckoner,Im probably gonna switch from chrome soon...eats so many resources.
28-02-2018T01:51:08,Bgrmystr2,ew bing
28-02-2018T01:56:11,unsteddyphoenix,Damn. Anyone seen Making a Murderer?
28-02-2018T01:56:23,TheBeckoner,I hasnt
28-02-2018T01:58:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Not a big tv watcher
28-02-2018T01:59:33,unsteddyphoenix,S'on Netflix.
28-02-2018T01:59:53,unsteddyphoenix,"But man, it's pretty dark."
28-02-2018T02:00:08,unsteddyphoenix,Really criticizes the whole justice system
28-02-2018T02:00:09,Dadrobit,I think I heard about it? The documentary about how incompetence allowed for a special needs dude to be coerced into admitting guilt for a murder he probably didn't commit.
28-02-2018T02:00:45,Dadrobit,"But I only heard about it froma comedy radio station, so my facts are rather alternative"
28-02-2018T02:00:52,Dadrobit,from a*
28-02-2018T02:01:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"Not a Netflix user either. If I watch something, it’s with others"
28-02-2018T02:01:49,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, a borderline retarded kid was basically harassed into giving a confession."
28-02-2018T02:02:58,unsteddyphoenix,Really makes you realise how things can be twisted
28-02-2018T02:04:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"Memory manipulation is one of the reasons for false confessions, right along with police persuasion"
28-02-2018T02:05:34,Dadrobit,"Yeah, shit's far from perfect. Recently hada kid finally get released from jail after two years of being slandared as a cerial pedophile rapist when something like 12 of the 13 girls who accused him came forward about lying about the whole thing."
28-02-2018T02:05:49,Dadrobit,had a* serial**
28-02-2018T02:06:05,unsteddyphoenix,TWELVE girls lied?
28-02-2018T02:06:26,Dadrobit,"Kid was in high school and he went throgh 3 girlfriends back to back, so they wanted revenge."
28-02-2018T02:06:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Gets even “better” when there’s a racist element added too unfortunately 😞
28-02-2018T02:07:08,unsteddyphoenix,"Goddamn,  I never heard that one"
28-02-2018T02:07:21,Dadrobit,Most of them actually came forward early on in the proceedings saying the whole thing was a lie after they realized how serious it was.
28-02-2018T02:07:39,unsteddyphoenix,Damn.
28-02-2018T02:07:47,Dadrobit,"But because the main trio stuck to their stories for so many years, the kid was stuck"
28-02-2018T02:08:06,unsteddyphoenix,It doesnt just discriminated against minorities. Also against the poor and the stupid i've learnt.
28-02-2018T02:08:34,Dadrobit,Eventually 2 of the 3 came forward with texts and facebook messages taking about getting together and planning the whole thing out
28-02-2018T02:08:36,SpazztasticKiwi,What was the book where the girls pretend there’re witches compelling their actions when they’re caught playing around in the woods?
28-02-2018T02:08:47,Dadrobit,Salem Witch Trials
28-02-2018T02:09:14,SpazztasticKiwi,That kind of thing seems to have only escalated it seems
28-02-2018T02:10:22,Dadrobit,"Did a bit of research on it a few years back. I always thought a ton of people were killed in the trials, but as it turns out, it was only about 20-something."
28-02-2018T02:10:37,Dadrobit,"But tons of people were accused and found ""guilty"""
28-02-2018T02:11:18,Dadrobit,"Before people started sayg, ""oh shit, we might not be right here..."" and let most of them go."
28-02-2018T02:11:22,Dadrobit,saying*
28-02-2018T02:12:23,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah even when there's doubt it still takes a looong time for it to come to fruition
28-02-2018T02:12:24,Dadrobit,"200 were accused, 20 were executed."
28-02-2018T02:12:35,unsteddyphoenix,Werent the people of salem like
28-02-2018T02:12:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Those who confessed and said they were witches we’re allowed to live and often became accusers themselves
28-02-2018T02:12:39,unsteddyphoenix,All high?
28-02-2018T02:12:50,unsteddyphoenix,Like wasnt there something about their water being contaminated
28-02-2018T02:12:57,Dadrobit,Not that I'm aware of?
28-02-2018T02:13:14,unsteddyphoenix,"Maybe that was just conjecture, but I heard that somewhere"
28-02-2018T02:13:35,SpazztasticKiwi,If I remember it right it was because the ringleader girl just refused to admit she was lying
28-02-2018T02:13:55,SpazztasticKiwi,And bullied the others into following her
28-02-2018T02:15:13,unsteddyphoenix,Spooky
28-02-2018T02:15:26,Dadrobit,"I think I found what you're talking about. Some undergrad postulated that a particular fungus that can grow in rye holds the potential to generate hallucinations in the consumer, and thus may be the instigating factor in the Witch Hunt"
28-02-2018T02:15:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Wouldn’t doubt it
28-02-2018T02:15:49,unsteddyphoenix,Once youre accused of something...your career could be over right there
28-02-2018T02:16:04,unsteddyphoenix,"Mm, it's an interesting theory"
28-02-2018T02:16:10,Dadrobit,But she goes on to say that it was likely just mass hysteria that followed and escalated it.
28-02-2018T02:16:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"Olden days and mass hysteria? Nah, couldn’t be"
28-02-2018T02:17:23,unsteddyphoenix,thats lesss fun
28-02-2018T02:17:26,TheBeckoner,I just learned some of the history on the trials. The stuff I read said 19 fwiw
28-02-2018T02:17:51,SpazztasticKiwi,People back then did seem like they had the world’s biggest and most sensitive panic buttons though
28-02-2018T02:17:53,TheBeckoner,"""does she float?"" ""Witch!"""
28-02-2018T02:18:25,SpazztasticKiwi,The Devil’s wives are said to be identified by that same test
28-02-2018T02:18:50,Dadrobit,"Hm, was just going off wikipedia there, said 20 executions, and one death in jail."
28-02-2018T02:19:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Wikipedia: we all know they’re 100% accurate
28-02-2018T02:21:08,TheBeckoner,I probably have the 19 from just executions not including the death in jail if I had a bet
28-02-2018T02:21:47,SpazztasticKiwi,This is why I like The Great Gatsby and old books
28-02-2018T02:22:11,TheBeckoner,I really enjoyed The Great Gatsby
28-02-2018T02:23:02,SpazztasticKiwi,The Count of Monte Cristo was the best story of giving the middle finger to those who betrayed you
28-02-2018T02:23:26,SpazztasticKiwi,And Of Mice and Men made me want to throw something
28-02-2018T02:23:38,SpazztasticKiwi,As did To Kill A Mockingbird
28-02-2018T02:23:48,Dadrobit,"Hm, what are you going off of? Wiki lists 20 individuals by name. Plus an infant that was born and died in prison."
28-02-2018T02:24:08,Dadrobit,Plus another adult that died in prison
28-02-2018T02:24:17,Dadrobit,Plus one more that died in custody.
28-02-2018T02:24:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Who wrote the book again? I might have it on shelf
28-02-2018T02:24:56,TheBeckoner,I was saying just 19 executions not including other deaths - although Im not sure when the history book was written.
28-02-2018T02:24:57,Dadrobit,"I mean, it's really inconsequential, just wondering."
28-02-2018T02:25:19,Dadrobit,I wonder who's missing?
28-02-2018T02:25:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I need to read that again. Unless it’s one of the books I haven’t collected yet
28-02-2018T02:25:37,TheBeckoner,"I'm probably wrong, history aint my deal. Just learned about it a few days ago."
28-02-2018T02:26:11,TheBeckoner,Im not sure tbh. Book is probably old and they probably figured it was more than 19 people by now or something
28-02-2018T02:27:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"“How many died again?” “Eh, just ball park it. No one’ll notice”"
28-02-2018T02:28:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Then again there’s also instances where towns didn’t record your death if you were executed for certain things
28-02-2018T02:29:49,Dadrobit,"Well. With these happy thoughts in my mind, I think I'm going to head to bed..."
28-02-2018T02:29:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"Things like birth out of wedlock, cheating, and witchcraft"
28-02-2018T02:30:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Nite nite dream of injustice tonight
28-02-2018T02:30:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"You got a favorite oldie book, Tom?"
28-02-2018T02:35:46,TheBeckoner,Night Dadro
28-02-2018T02:36:00,TheBeckoner,Tom wrote his favorite book.
28-02-2018T02:36:06,TheBeckoner,(comic)
28-02-2018T02:36:24,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s why I said “oldie book”
28-02-2018T02:36:39,unsteddyphoenix,gnight daddy
28-02-2018T02:36:40,TheBeckoner,I don't read stuff sometimes.

28-02-2018T02:44:18,TheBeckoner,Like what?

28-02-2018T02:57:06,unsteddyphoenix,I know I am :D
28-02-2018T02:57:14,TheBeckoner,I guess I am
28-02-2018T02:57:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"I can be, but I think I have a more “where did that come from?” personality"
28-02-2018T02:58:20,TheBeckoner,Hmm
28-02-2018T02:58:31,TheBeckoner,Milk bees? y/n
28-02-2018T02:59:12,unsteddyphoenix,Y
28-02-2018T02:59:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’d say that’s what honey is, but I imagine if you milk bees, you get the venom"
28-02-2018T02:59:17,unsteddyphoenix,milk anything with nipples
28-02-2018T02:59:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok try milking an adult man
28-02-2018T02:59:47,SpazztasticKiwi,See where it gets you
28-02-2018T02:59:53,TheBeckoner,Sometimes that works
28-02-2018T02:59:58,unsteddyphoenix,You assume I havent already
28-02-2018T03:00:00,TheBeckoner,&gt;The bee has perished
28-02-2018T03:00:26,TheBeckoner,Every milked bee is a dead bee.
28-02-2018T03:00:42,TheBeckoner,I get more enjoyment out of that little question thing than I should...
28-02-2018T03:00:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Well that’s how they make anti venom
28-02-2018T03:02:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Since Tom’s not gone I believe he fell asleep at the computer or something
28-02-2018T03:03:07,Twokinds,:ptv-sleepy::ptv-sleepy:
28-02-2018T03:03:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Or maybe he’s dead

28-02-2018T03:07:31,unsteddyphoenix,Since...I think there was a face one and...I could use it
28-02-2018T03:07:47,TheBeckoner,Like on how to draw?
28-02-2018T03:07:57,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah

28-02-2018T03:18:25,SpazztasticKiwi,You’d think some kind of autocorrect would say “dude. Stap”
28-02-2018T03:18:28,unsteddyphoenix,Was he trying to get you to rewrite the script like?

28-02-2018T03:19:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh goodie that debate again
28-02-2018T03:19:01,TheBeckoner,NOT THAT AGAIN
28-02-2018T03:19:02,unsteddyphoenix,Ahhh so thats where that came from
28-02-2018T03:19:13,TheBeckoner,My head still hurts from last time...
28-02-2018T03:19:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I thought we settled that
28-02-2018T03:19:16,Twokinds,"But yeah, there were a lot of misc errors. I can't believe how bad to have missed all of them."
28-02-2018T03:19:30,TheBeckoner,hm
28-02-2018T03:19:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Did anyone hunt down an English teacher?
28-02-2018T03:20:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Or maybe one of us can have a sit down debate at the next con
28-02-2018T03:20:19,unsteddyphoenix,I left out like....tiny tiiiiny things. Like super slightly offcenter text
28-02-2018T03:20:44,unsteddyphoenix,But damn
28-02-2018T03:20:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Unacceptable. Redo the whole thing
28-02-2018T03:20:47,Bgrmystr2,"lol, I could technically fill that position Kiwi, but it's a mess to really get down into something like that."
28-02-2018T03:21:14,TheBeckoner,Are you an english teacher?
28-02-2018T03:21:17,unsteddyphoenix,Next time I will try to do better I promise lol
28-02-2018T03:21:35,Bgrmystr2,"No, Beck, but I had college level English Comprehension in 6th grade."
28-02-2018T03:21:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"I think I’d be easier in person where it can be put on paper and dissected that way, ya know?"
28-02-2018T03:22:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I took a few high grade English classes too
28-02-2018T03:22:40,TheBeckoner,That's neat. I uh...didnt lol
28-02-2018T03:22:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"They seemed to like my essays pretty well, but I don’t know if this and that match up"
28-02-2018T03:22:59,TheBeckoner,English was never a subject I did well in.
28-02-2018T03:23:20,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah. Helpful sometimes, but not exactly fun."
28-02-2018T03:23:22,Twokinds,lol
28-02-2018T03:23:29,Twokinds,It's fine
28-02-2018T03:23:39,Twokinds,I didn't catch any of these either
28-02-2018T03:23:46,Twokinds,That's why I give it to many editors
28-02-2018T03:23:53,TheBeckoner,Neither did I - the average reader
28-02-2018T03:24:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"My brain tends to go faster than my eyes sometimes, so"
28-02-2018T03:25:09,unsteddyphoenix,Theyve got you (and me) covered :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
28-02-2018T03:25:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Reading comprehension is great but spell checking is not

28-02-2018T03:26:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Attention span of a spoon
28-02-2018T03:26:13,unsteddyphoenix,It's easy to gloss over errors
28-02-2018T03:26:18,unsteddyphoenix,I think everyone does
28-02-2018T03:26:33,Bgrmystr2,xD Beck
28-02-2018T03:26:37,TheBeckoner,Spoon are reflective so are they never not paying attention? They see all...
28-02-2018T03:26:47,TheBeckoner,s to spoon
28-02-2018T03:27:00,SpazztasticKiwi,The brain’s auto correct/fill-in feature is to blame there
28-02-2018T03:29:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"But I say that if it’s your world, you make the grammar rules"
28-02-2018T03:29:35,Bgrmystr2,"it's not about that though, Kiwi"
28-02-2018T03:29:45,Bgrmystr2,cuz the text needs to be adapted so our world can understand
28-02-2018T03:29:47,unsteddyphoenix,ehh unsure about that
28-02-2018T03:29:53,unsteddyphoenix,yeah what bgr said
28-02-2018T03:30:30,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, if tom wanted the text to have it's own grammar rules, it'd be in the respective language, and we couldn't make heads or tails trying to make sense of it anyway"
28-02-2018T03:30:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"Well if it’s decided that “a” is capitalized if and only if it is used in the context of talking about said “a” being a people, it is therefore capitalized"
28-02-2018T03:31:46,TheBeckoner,has checked out of the grammar hotel craziness
28-02-2018T03:32:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Or you can base it off of another language’s rules that’s simpler than English
28-02-2018T03:32:39,SpazztasticKiwi,But still write it in English
28-02-2018T03:33:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Like I said: something better and more easily discussed in person and with paper
28-02-2018T03:34:02,Bgrmystr2,that's... not how language works XD
28-02-2018T03:34:15,Bgrmystr2,noooo :ptv-laugh:
28-02-2018T03:34:23,TheBeckoner,I am tired boi

28-02-2018T03:34:36,Bgrmystr2,gnight Beck
28-02-2018T03:35:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"Too bad. English is so wacky it may as well not be a language, but yet here we are"
28-02-2018T03:35:28,Bgrmystr2,English is an official language. Made by England :P
28-02-2018T03:35:50,SpazztasticKiwi,If you say so
28-02-2018T03:36:10,Bgrmystr2,You'd think the name English would come from somewhere.. lol
28-02-2018T03:36:21,SpazztasticKiwi,But it’s also based on Latin and shares the same roots as German
28-02-2018T03:37:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"*French , not German"
28-02-2018T03:38:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’ve been typing “German” so much because of my lessons, my phone wants to input it in every sentence"
28-02-2018T03:39:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"By the way, who decided that German needed three words for “the”?"
28-02-2018T03:43:01,unsteddyphoenix,prob the french
28-02-2018T03:44:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"It’s ridiculous. I mean, it’s not proving to be very hard, just weird"
28-02-2018T03:45:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I think I scared everyone off

28-02-2018T03:59:47,Bgrmystr2,and finish it tomorrow?
28-02-2018T04:00:21,Bgrmystr2,you may just need a break
28-02-2018T04:00:36,Bgrmystr2,likely mental stress

28-02-2018T04:05:40,iliar,Some of the phrases I wrote at 4 am are horrible and then required correction. To sleep out before writing tex is a good idea.
28-02-2018T04:08:34,unsteddyphoenix,Mmm
28-02-2018T04:08:52,Twokinds,Yes sleep is good

28-02-2018T04:11:13,Twokinds,I'm just waiting for my bed to heat up.

28-02-2018T04:11:45,unsteddyphoenix,Preheat the bed before putting yourself in
28-02-2018T04:11:55,Twokinds,I don't like getting into a cold bed.
28-02-2018T04:12:13,Bgrmystr2,how exactly do you .. warm a bed?
28-02-2018T04:12:17,Bgrmystr2,other than laying in it?
28-02-2018T04:12:19,Twokinds,"So I turn an electic blanket and heat it up, then turn it back off before getting in."
28-02-2018T04:12:24,Bgrmystr2,oooh you have one of those

28-02-2018T04:12:56,Twokinds,I should have had this years ago.
28-02-2018T04:12:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"Have a pet, partner, or heated blanket"
28-02-2018T04:13:08,unsteddyphoenix,Or a hot water bottle!

28-02-2018T04:14:10,unsteddyphoenix,Budget affection!
28-02-2018T04:14:12,Twokinds,"So much money on cat toys, litter, food, and allergy meds"
28-02-2018T04:14:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m just allergic to their shenanigans
28-02-2018T04:14:33,unsteddyphoenix,You know cat toys arent a necessity
28-02-2018T04:14:36,SpazztasticKiwi,My cats like to play with boxes
28-02-2018T04:14:46,SpazztasticKiwi,And they don’t use litter
28-02-2018T04:14:51,unsteddyphoenix,I think your cat has tricked you
28-02-2018T04:15:39,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah my cat never needed a litterbox
28-02-2018T04:16:14,unsteddyphoenix,"She kinda came to us pre-trained, which was nice~"
28-02-2018T04:16:34,Twokinds,"Uh, what else would they use?"
28-02-2018T04:16:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Toilet
28-02-2018T04:16:47,unsteddyphoenix,Outside?
28-02-2018T04:16:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Flushing cat box
28-02-2018T04:16:58,Twokinds,"My cat has never left my bedroom, much less gone outside."
28-02-2018T04:17:09,unsteddyphoenix,Wow
28-02-2018T04:17:16,SpazztasticKiwi,She not get along with Lucy and the others?
28-02-2018T04:17:23,unsteddyphoenix,Your introversion has rubbed off on your cat
28-02-2018T04:17:37,Twokinds,"Yeah, not really a fan of the dogs, no."
28-02-2018T04:17:48,unsteddyphoenix,Or she just loves you that much &lt;3
28-02-2018T04:17:51,Twokinds,It's not like she's stuck in the room. The door's open.
28-02-2018T04:18:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera hates big dogs. Loves people
28-02-2018T04:18:12,SpazztasticKiwi,And Kiwi hates men
28-02-2018T04:18:13,Twokinds,She will meow in the hallway if I'm out of my room for too long.
28-02-2018T04:18:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Aw
28-02-2018T04:18:30,unsteddyphoenix,Oh my god~ Thats precious
28-02-2018T04:18:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera slaps at me if I ignore him
28-02-2018T04:19:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"“Pet me, dammit”"
28-02-2018T04:19:12,unsteddyphoenix,Wait so your cat is ALWAYS around you? And youre allergic?
28-02-2018T04:19:24,Twokinds,Yeeeah
28-02-2018T04:19:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’d take her, but...."

28-02-2018T04:20:09,Bgrmystr2,xD gonna agree w/ phoenix on that one
28-02-2018T04:20:13,unsteddyphoenix,Did you base Eric and Kat
28-02-2018T04:20:16,unsteddyphoenix,On you and your cat?

28-02-2018T04:20:29,unsteddyphoenix,It all makes sense
28-02-2018T04:20:33,Bgrmystr2,THE RUMOR COME OUT
28-02-2018T04:20:47,Twokinds,yes you found it out
28-02-2018T04:20:49,Bgrmystr2,DOES ERIC AND KAT IS REAL?
28-02-2018T04:20:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I have wondered who some of the characters could be based off of
28-02-2018T04:20:56,Bgrmystr2,You nailed it phoenix
28-02-2018T04:21:04,unsteddyphoenix,I am an investigative GENIUS
28-02-2018T04:21:10,Twokinds,"it all makes sense, except I didn't have the cat in 2006."
28-02-2018T04:21:19,unsteddyphoenix,Allegedly.
28-02-2018T04:21:32,unsteddyphoenix,It's basically the exact same relationship.
28-02-2018T04:21:37,Twokinds,She's only 9 years old XD
28-02-2018T04:21:47,unsteddyphoenix,Conjecture!
28-02-2018T04:21:48,SpazztasticKiwi,You predicted the future
28-02-2018T04:21:57,unsteddyphoenix,It's about when the dynamic really developed anyway
28-02-2018T04:22:05,iliar,For a long time I want to ask. Why you don't draw a whiskers from Keidran?
28-02-2018T04:22:12,unsteddyphoenix,Not neccessarily when they were introduced
28-02-2018T04:22:23,Twokinds,Eh same reason I don't draw pawpads on their hands
28-02-2018T04:22:26,Twokinds,Most of the time...
28-02-2018T04:22:31,Twokinds,Stylistic
28-02-2018T04:22:49,unsteddyphoenix,Are keidran legs longer than human legs?
28-02-2018T04:22:58,Twokinds,Yeah
28-02-2018T04:23:25,unsteddyphoenix,"Neat, I noticed that!"
28-02-2018T04:23:32,unsteddyphoenix,Man im figuring things out left and right.
28-02-2018T04:23:50,Twokinds,"Okay, bed's warm. Gunna go sleep for real now."

28-02-2018T04:24:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I would’ve been in bed thirty minutes ago if I hadn’t have had to pry a dead mouse from Bagheera’s jaws of life
28-02-2018T04:25:15,unsteddyphoenix,&lt;333
28-02-2018T04:25:57,Bgrmystr2,haha iliar
28-02-2018T04:26:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"There was a noise from my frog’s tank, and I released Bagheera and told him “fetch”"
28-02-2018T04:27:56,unsteddyphoenix,Very good
28-02-2018T04:28:09,unsteddyphoenix,How you complaining when you told her to do it
28-02-2018T04:28:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"Bagheera’a a he, and I told him to fetch, not play keep away"
28-02-2018T04:29:45,unsteddyphoenix,Details
28-02-2018T04:30:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"He tried, that’s what matters"
28-02-2018T04:30:21,SpazztasticKiwi,And he technically succeeded
28-02-2018T04:30:32,unsteddyphoenix,You gave him a job and you know what he did?
28-02-2018T04:30:34,unsteddyphoenix,His best.
28-02-2018T04:30:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I just didn’t want him to try to eat the mouse
28-02-2018T04:31:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Kiwi pukes them back up if she’s left with them
28-02-2018T04:31:39,unsteddyphoenix,Did you try telling her there's starving cats in africa?
28-02-2018T04:32:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I just think she’s got a sensitive tummy. She’s been indoors since I got her at a few months old
28-02-2018T04:33:31,unsteddyphoenix,Hopefully when I get a cat it can be indoor/outdoor.
28-02-2018T04:34:02,unsteddyphoenix,Dealing with litterboxes doesnt sound fun
28-02-2018T04:34:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’ve learned my lesson with the indoor/outdoor mess. After losing three cats, Kiwi and Bagheera stay indoors"
28-02-2018T04:35:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"Besides, there’s too many prejudice people around here for Bagheera to be out anyway"
28-02-2018T04:35:29,unsteddyphoenix,It def depends where you live
28-02-2018T04:36:16,unsteddyphoenix,I remember we had no issues withour cat for like 6-7 years then one day she came home with blood all over her face missing a tooth.
28-02-2018T04:36:47,unsteddyphoenix,Poor thing...no idea who or what did that to her.
28-02-2018T04:37:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"Could’ve been a cat or dog fight, or even a car"
28-02-2018T04:37:51,unsteddyphoenix,Injury seemed too small for a car. Sadly I suspect it was a person. :/
28-02-2018T04:52:43,SpazztasticKiwi,All the more reason to keep them in. Indoor cats tend to live to be about 20 where as indoor/outdoor and outdoor cats live to be about 15ish
28-02-2018T04:53:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"Providing other factors like genetics of the particular cat and pet, of course"
28-02-2018T04:53:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"*diet, not pet"
28-02-2018T04:57:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Which means Tom has about 10 more years of allergies with Holly
28-02-2018T04:58:51,unsteddyphoenix,Good~
28-02-2018T04:59:00,unsteddyphoenix,"Well if I end up getting a job in the city area like will probably happen, then it'll be 100% indoors."
28-02-2018T04:59:22,unsteddyphoenix,I feel like as long as youre a decent distance from cars then it shouldnt be that bad
28-02-2018T04:59:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I live in a wooded area. Still lost three cats
28-02-2018T05:00:19,unsteddyphoenix,I hope youre an outlier
28-02-2018T05:00:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"Dusty and Domino may have been gotten by coyotes, but Candy died of an unknown bite"
28-02-2018T05:00:54,unsteddyphoenix,Oh. We dont have any dangerous animals here so.
28-02-2018T05:01:15,SpazztasticKiwi,No outdoors. No exceptions
28-02-2018T05:02:07,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah if theres wild dogs in the area that seems bad
28-02-2018T05:03:22,SpazztasticKiwi,And I’m not getting rid of them either. Had a bf that wasn’t fond of animals
28-02-2018T05:04:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"Told him in the beginning Kiwi wasn’t going anywhere. He didn’t like it,but seemed to accept it"
28-02-2018T05:05:29,unsteddyphoenix,Why would you date someone so evil
28-02-2018T05:05:35,unsteddyphoenix,Women only go for badboys UGH
28-02-2018T05:06:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don’t care if you don’t like or are allergic to pets, but I’m not going to get rid of mine just for it. When the ones I have pass away, I’ll leave it at that, but my life changing to add another person shouldn’t boot them out"
28-02-2018T05:07:34,Bgrmystr2,Someone not liking them is something they can deal
28-02-2018T05:07:39,Bgrmystr2,but being allergic is entirely different
28-02-2018T05:07:42,Bgrmystr2,that's a medical issue
28-02-2018T05:07:47,Bgrmystr2,and something they can't control
28-02-2018T05:07:52,unsteddyphoenix,I forgive someone for being allergic
28-02-2018T05:07:54,unsteddyphoenix,Just.
28-02-2018T05:08:39,SpazztasticKiwi,The allergic part I figure moving them back home to my mom’s instead of the house said allergic person and I live
28-02-2018T05:08:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I was talking about them trying to tell me to give them to a shelter
28-02-2018T05:09:03,unsteddyphoenix,I would just buy them meds
28-02-2018T05:09:13,Bgrmystr2,"oh, it's not like you have to get RID of the cat, no"
28-02-2018T05:09:19,unsteddyphoenix,If anyone ever told me to get rid of my pets? Relationship over.
28-02-2018T05:09:29,unsteddyphoenix,Absolutely noy.
28-02-2018T05:09:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I wouldn’t force someone to stay with my cats if it made you sick
28-02-2018T05:09:59,Bgrmystr2,"if you have someplace where you can leave the cats and you can still see them, that's totally fine"
28-02-2018T05:09:59,unsteddyphoenix,MMmmmm :ctwokinds-flomad:
28-02-2018T05:10:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"And if I did move in with someone, it would be a guy and Kiwi hates men"
28-02-2018T05:10:03,unsteddyphoenix,I guess when you put it that way...
28-02-2018T05:10:08,Bgrmystr2,gotta make sure you wash all that stuff off though
28-02-2018T05:10:18,Bgrmystr2,cuz all that pet allergins will come home with you
28-02-2018T05:10:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Kiwi would have to be moved because she’d be too stressed
28-02-2018T05:10:35,Bgrmystr2,and fuck the other person's day all up
28-02-2018T05:11:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I understand completely what you’re saying. My cats would move back in with my mom and sister where I still technically own and can see them
28-02-2018T05:12:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I just mean if someone who was allergic said I couldn’t have them around at all anymore
28-02-2018T05:12:24,unsteddyphoenix,Thats still...so much sacriffice. I feel like im too selfish for that.
28-02-2018T05:13:23,Bgrmystr2,"there's a LOT of people with allergies out there, phoenix"
28-02-2018T05:13:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"It would only mean they’d be two hours away at this point, unless I get a home in my hometown"
28-02-2018T05:14:09,unsteddyphoenix,I wish they would choose not to have allergies it is very upsetting to me :/
28-02-2018T05:14:16,Bgrmystr2,xDD
28-02-2018T05:14:20,Bgrmystr2,"""choose"""
28-02-2018T05:15:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"The main problem I have is Kiwi though; she’d have to be removed because she doesn’t like men, and I don’t even know why"
28-02-2018T05:16:03,SpazztasticKiwi,And being two hours away wouldn’t be very fun for me
28-02-2018T05:16:11,unsteddyphoenix,Just date a girly man
28-02-2018T05:16:16,unsteddyphoenix,OR
28-02-2018T05:16:25,unsteddyphoenix,Dress up all your bfs in dresses when theyre around
28-02-2018T05:17:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not doing that to them. Cats aren’t fooled by clothes
28-02-2018T05:17:29,unsteddyphoenix,Unproven
28-02-2018T05:17:46,SpazztasticKiwi,She recognizes the bass of a male voice and the movement/posture
28-02-2018T05:17:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve seen it
28-02-2018T05:18:01,Bgrmystr2,cats see with their ears
28-02-2018T05:18:11,Bgrmystr2,as long as you don't make a sound
28-02-2018T05:18:15,Bgrmystr2,they won't know you're there.
28-02-2018T05:18:20,Bgrmystr2,:D?
28-02-2018T05:18:33,SpazztasticKiwi,My ex had long hair and she avoided him like the plague when she heard him
28-02-2018T05:19:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"Or if she came to see me in my room and saw him there, she’d leave"
28-02-2018T05:19:51,unsteddyphoenix,"Dress them up in dress, make them not talk. We're golden."
28-02-2018T05:19:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"Granted, he was the same one that didn’t like animals, so maybe she knew"
28-02-2018T05:20:10,SpazztasticKiwi,But she also doesn’t like my pastor
28-02-2018T05:20:31,unsteddyphoenix,They get a bad rep
28-02-2018T05:20:47,unsteddyphoenix,Fair testing needed with boy who doesnt hate cat
28-02-2018T05:21:10,Bgrmystr2,animals can sense when other animals or people do not respect them.
28-02-2018T05:21:18,Bgrmystr2,it's an instinct
28-02-2018T05:21:36,Bgrmystr2,"they're naturally defensive, even aggressive sometimes"
28-02-2018T05:21:48,Bgrmystr2,to people who aren't nice
28-02-2018T05:22:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"Think I’ll stick to letting love find me. If they’re allergic, we’ll move the cats. If not they stay"
28-02-2018T05:22:27,Bgrmystr2,"sounds good to me, honestly"
28-02-2018T05:22:44,SpazztasticKiwi,By the time I do find someone though both may be passed away anyway at this rate
28-02-2018T05:23:02,unsteddyphoenix,Mmm. Wish that option existed for me~
28-02-2018T05:23:28,Bgrmystr2,"imagine you found someone you really loved who had a completely irrational fear of cats, but knew it was irrational, just that it's a gut reaction, and difficult to control."
28-02-2018T05:23:29,unsteddyphoenix,Im so lazy~
28-02-2018T05:23:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d pretty much decided Kiwi was the last one until Bagheera was dumped on us and became mine
28-02-2018T05:24:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"Besides, if they’re allergic to cats or anything furry, I like snakes too"
28-02-2018T05:25:08,unsteddyphoenix,:snake:
28-02-2018T05:25:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I even have a Pac Man frog that’s about two now
28-02-2018T05:42:34,Bgrmystr2,My dad's always had dogs
28-02-2018T05:42:39,Bgrmystr2,and I like dogs
28-02-2018T05:42:47,Bgrmystr2,they big and fluffy and playful
28-02-2018T05:42:56,Bgrmystr2,and they have so much energy
28-02-2018T05:43:06,Bgrmystr2,but I always liked that cats just kinda
28-02-2018T05:43:06,SpazztasticKiwi,My dad didn’t particularly like much of anything
28-02-2018T05:43:13,Bgrmystr2,MEH.. and laze about
28-02-2018T05:43:23,Bgrmystr2,they're glad to just.. lay there and sleep
28-02-2018T05:43:39,Bgrmystr2,"and I've never really had a pet cat, nor been to anyone's house for long periods of time who had cats."
28-02-2018T05:43:54,Bgrmystr2,everyone I know are like.. dog people.
28-02-2018T05:47:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m going on to bed before I’m up the last two hours before I start the next day
28-02-2018T05:48:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"Night guys (and Tom, who seems to have never logged off)"
28-02-2018T06:43:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Looks like chat cleared itself
28-02-2018T07:17:56,Barabashe4ka,Hello everybody
28-02-2018T07:19:05,Barabashe4ka,SpazztasticKiwi probably
28-02-2018T07:24:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah I was going to bed but it was only about an hour til up time
28-02-2018T07:27:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Now I guess I do what I need to today till everyone else gets up
28-02-2018T09:28:45,NightMeaty22,Good morning
28-02-2018T10:58:00,MidnightBlue78,:ptv-greetings:
28-02-2018T10:58:15,MidnightBlue78,good morning~
28-02-2018T11:24:39,SykezWolf,Good morning! Tom didn't upload a recording of Wednesday's stream?
28-02-2018T11:27:34,RandomTKLover,It was a comic stream right?
28-02-2018T11:27:52,RandomTKLover,Or was it nora cards?
28-02-2018T11:27:58,RandomTKLover,I wasn’t there
28-02-2018T11:30:14,iliar,It was a page stream.
28-02-2018T11:30:42,iliar,Picarto lost stream record.
28-02-2018T11:32:28,SykezWolf,Aww :c
28-02-2018T11:33:38,iliar,"But it you want, you can see record on YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/c/TwoKindsStreams"
28-02-2018T11:37:48,SykezWolf,Oh thank you very much!
28-02-2018T16:17:14,Twokinds,I'm so absentminded...
28-02-2018T16:18:24,iliar,What's the matter?
28-02-2018T16:23:31,Twokinds,Nothing. I just start things and then forget what I was doing.
28-02-2018T16:25:02,SpazztasticKiwi,We all do that. It’s a part of being a sim
28-02-2018T16:26:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though sometimes it’s not that you’re absentminded, it’s that your mind walks away from you and hides"
28-02-2018T16:57:52,unsteddyphoenix,So ...sometimes your mind walks away and is absent?
28-02-2018T17:21:17,Twokinds,"Sorry, I forgot I was talking here. Yes."
28-02-2018T17:22:45,unsteddyphoenix,Hahah
28-02-2018T17:23:31,unsteddyphoenix,what were you doing that you forgot?
28-02-2018T17:25:36,Twokinds,Everything all the time
28-02-2018T17:26:33,unsteddyphoenix,Ah. Yeah same.
28-02-2018T17:26:49,unsteddyphoenix,I can honestly be meaning to do something then sit down and forget.
28-02-2018T17:26:57,unsteddyphoenix,s'all it takes
28-02-2018T17:51:33,BluePhantom90,hey all
28-02-2018T18:19:11,TheBeckoner,@Twokinds livin life in the fast lane?
28-02-2018T18:19:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"If I hadn’t taken this tiny nap, I’d have been up for a complete 24 hours"
28-02-2018T18:20:02,TheBeckoner,Quitter
28-02-2018T18:49:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I have full shifts it looks like for the next four days straight
28-02-2018T19:18:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"My feet gonna hurt, but I’ll be active 👌🏻"
28-02-2018T19:28:37,JaydenMozingo,Yaaaay... I just got my braces tightened.
28-02-2018T19:29:06,JaydenMozingo,The only thing I feel in my body is physical pain in my face.
28-02-2018T19:29:49,JaydenMozingo,Did I miss a comic stream?
28-02-2018T19:30:21,JaydenMozingo,"That was rude of me, Hello everyone."
28-02-2018T19:31:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I think we’re all in our own form of pain
28-02-2018T19:32:11,JaydenMozingo,It would appear so. How are you Spazz?
28-02-2018T19:33:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom’s got the memory of a goldfish, unsteddy can sit down and knock a thought right out of his head, and I have royally fecked up my sleep schedule"
28-02-2018T19:33:41,SpazztasticKiwi,But I feel disturbingly optimistic about the next week
28-02-2018T19:33:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m suspicious of this optimism
28-02-2018T19:35:25,JaydenMozingo,Ow XD
28-02-2018T19:37:20,SpazztasticKiwi,You know what sounds reeeealy good right now? A hot foot soak
28-02-2018T19:38:37,JaydenMozingo,"Well, Tom, short term memory loss happens to a lot of people. Thankfuuly not more than 16% though. I bet it could be fixed based from your current emotions or moods"
28-02-2018T19:39:16,JaydenMozingo,"Spazz, get some sleep early. I've screwed up mine enough that I only get sleepy at 3am"
28-02-2018T19:40:09,JaydenMozingo,"unsteddy, I can't help you with metaphorically or physically knocking thoughts from your head after the process of sitting down."
28-02-2018T19:41:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not entirely sure they’re paying much attention to the chat
28-02-2018T19:41:08,JaydenMozingo,Just realized I mis-spelled a lot of things. My hea dhurts because the braces.
28-02-2018T19:41:24,SpazztasticKiwi,But you better believe I’m gonna try going to bed early today
28-02-2018T19:41:30,JaydenMozingo,Probably. Eh. Did I miss a stream though?
28-02-2018T19:41:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Today? No
28-02-2018T19:41:53,JaydenMozingo,yesturdaay
28-02-2018T19:42:03,JaydenMozingo,Yesterday*
28-02-2018T19:42:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah. It’s on YT
28-02-2018T19:42:54,JaydenMozingo,YT?
28-02-2018T19:43:05,SpazztasticKiwi,YouTube
28-02-2018T19:43:07,JaydenMozingo,"I'm sorry, I'm just a bit out of it right now dude"
28-02-2018T19:43:15,JaydenMozingo,Oh. I'll check
28-02-2018T19:44:18,JaydenMozingo,I might rake a nap for a while. This is excruciating..
28-02-2018T19:44:45,JaydenMozingo,take*
28-02-2018T19:44:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Tylenol & oragel too?
28-02-2018T19:45:24,JaydenMozingo,I think I took a Tylenol. I can't remmeber clearly
28-02-2018T19:45:35,JaydenMozingo,(sigh) remember*
28-02-2018T19:45:42,SpazztasticKiwi,*orajel
28-02-2018T19:46:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t know what else. I never got braces
28-02-2018T19:46:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m gonna hop off for a minute too
28-02-2018T19:46:25,JaydenMozingo,"They hurt, I can tell you that."
28-02-2018T19:46:54,JaydenMozingo,"Ooh, my profile pic changed finally. I might keep it like this"
28-02-2018T19:47:31,JaydenMozingo,I like retro 80's things. I also like the DeLorean. Beautiful car
28-02-2018T20:38:51,SpazztasticKiwi,What’s everyone doing?
28-02-2018T20:39:19,TheBeckoner,Doin good. I have food and tea. How are you?
28-02-2018T20:45:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Tired. Bed time in a few hours
28-02-2018T20:47:00,TheBeckoner,I wish I didn't have to sleep...
28-02-2018T20:51:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"If sleeping wasn’t required, we’d get a lot more done"
28-02-2018T20:51:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Some of us would even have time to relax
28-02-2018T20:52:44,TheBeckoner,Huh funny how that would work...
28-02-2018T20:55:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though babies grow in their sleep, so maybe it would just be something we literally grow out of in such a world"
28-02-2018T20:55:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Either that or babies grow another way
28-02-2018T20:56:48,TheBeckoner,On trees
28-02-2018T20:57:26,SpazztasticKiwi,That’d save us from pregnancy
28-02-2018T20:57:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m all for it
28-02-2018T20:58:09,SpazztasticKiwi,One of the reasons I’m not keen on having kids
28-02-2018T21:00:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"You just grow like an apple on some branch till you’re able to learn walking, talking, etc or something, and then you never have to sleep again"
28-02-2018T21:01:22,TheBeckoner,Im for it.
28-02-2018T21:01:26,TheBeckoner,sounds like fun
28-02-2018T21:01:32,TheBeckoner,Not for the trees tho...
28-02-2018T21:05:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe we’d grow more like carrots or pineapples - in or close to the ground

28-02-2018T21:22:07,wolfspartan1,it's been glitchy for me
28-02-2018T21:22:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom just tweeted a page
28-02-2018T21:23:24,JaydenMozingo,Ooh

28-02-2018T21:28:48,JaydenMozingo,I flew in a WWII American light fighter plane. The Pt-19 Silver Streak
28-02-2018T21:28:59,JaydenMozingo,With an open cockpit
28-02-2018T21:29:12,JaydenMozingo,So I think a dragon wouldn't be too bad
28-02-2018T21:29:32,JaydenMozingo,unless they flew up side down then hell no
28-02-2018T21:30:21,JaydenMozingo,Any major acrobatics in an aircraft with an open cockpit is a NO for me.

28-02-2018T21:52:42,JaydenMozingo,Trace: Why do I have two sets of ears!?       Karen: Where are my other ears!?
28-02-2018T21:54:03,JaydenMozingo,Or Keith obtains bewbs and Natani loses hers. (or get bigger)
28-02-2018T22:00:06,JaydenMozingo,"My telephonular device has taken participation in the act of battery power loss, as my laptop does the same."
