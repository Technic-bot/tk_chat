27-07-2018T01:17:45,BadFoMo,Just chuck a thing of Kriptonight at him.
27-07-2018T01:17:55,unsteddyphoenix,ergo what dad said
27-07-2018T01:18:03,SageSaga,they always pick them at their strongest- Thor is part Old God- hes all magic
27-07-2018T01:18:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,and Aussie muscle
27-07-2018T01:18:22,TorqueEmUp,"Just strap some Kryptonite to Thor's Hammer, instadeath for Superman."
27-07-2018T01:18:22,unsteddyphoenix,Did they do superman vs saitama? that's the only chance I could see
27-07-2018T01:19:06,SageSaga,im pretty sure they will never do Saitama
27-07-2018T01:19:11,SageSaga,he wins everything
27-07-2018T01:19:23,MrEase,Wait Eric's still here? I thought he went out to do some thinking
27-07-2018T01:19:25,unsteddyphoenix,Since saitamas basically a superman parody they have the same bullshit powers
27-07-2018T01:19:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Any and all parody characters can beat superman, like bugs bunny"
27-07-2018T01:19:44,unsteddyphoenix,meta powers* I should say
27-07-2018T01:19:48,SageSaga,he doesnt have the same powers at all
27-07-2018T01:19:49,MrEase,I mean I guess he could have come back but I didn't think he'd be back so soon
27-07-2018T01:20:08,unsteddyphoenix,"The power of ""he wins because he wins"""
27-07-2018T01:20:13,SageSaga,Saitama basically just has no limit to his strength and speed- he cant fly
27-07-2018T01:20:23,Ordithus,Except by punching the air
27-07-2018T01:20:25,SageSaga,he cant shoot lasers out of his eyes
27-07-2018T01:20:36,Ordithus,He's really hard to hurt
27-07-2018T01:20:42,unsteddyphoenix,"Yes, I meant the ""power"" to never lose"
27-07-2018T01:20:45,unsteddyphoenix,Like superman has
27-07-2018T01:20:50,SageSaga,Superman has lost though
27-07-2018T01:20:58,Salinc,The do Saitama VS Superman. Result: draw.
27-07-2018T01:21:07,SageSaga,it wouldnt be a draw at all
27-07-2018T01:21:07,Salinc,*They
27-07-2018T01:21:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Saitama would win because he's a parody character, unlimited power"
27-07-2018T01:21:47,unsteddyphoenix,Supermans only limit is however strong his writers want him to be
27-07-2018T01:21:58,SageSaga,not totally true
27-07-2018T01:22:24,unsteddyphoenix,He reversed time by flying backwards around the earth or something!
27-07-2018T01:22:27,SageSaga,they have put limits on him and ways to push those limits
27-07-2018T01:22:31,BadFoMo,"Or, battle fotage crupte, ""Wow! What an epic battle!"""
27-07-2018T01:22:34,unsteddyphoenix,Originally superman couldnt fly
27-07-2018T01:22:36,turnsky,Saitama does have a theorhetical limitation but he's yet to hit it.
27-07-2018T01:22:40,unsteddyphoenix,Until they needed him to fly
27-07-2018T01:22:42,unsteddyphoenix,then he could
27-07-2018T01:23:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,this is why Wolverine is my favorite super hero
27-07-2018T01:23:08,SageSaga,Saitamas only limiting factor is his lazyness
27-07-2018T01:23:35,turnsky,"you'd be better off having Supes vs Goku, if anything it'd be a more entertaining fight overall."
27-07-2018T01:23:53,Bgrmystr2,even though we already had that
27-07-2018T01:23:57,SageSaga,twice
27-07-2018T01:23:58,turnsky,true
27-07-2018T01:24:19,unsteddyphoenix,and goku cant win
27-07-2018T01:24:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,ree
27-07-2018T01:24:26,unsteddyphoenix,Their logic isnt WRONG but it is annoying
27-07-2018T01:24:38,ZRO4825,Yup. Goku done got his butt Superkicked.
27-07-2018T01:24:39,SageSaga,Dr Manhattan can beat Supes too
27-07-2018T01:24:53,turnsky,"anyway like people said, Saitama's a parody of most shonen characters in that power curve state."
27-07-2018T01:26:11,SageSaga,Dr Manhattan controls the quantum letting him manipulate probability- his first act of using his powers-
27-07-2018T01:26:19,unsteddyphoenix,I think he's a parody of just the superhero genre in general
27-07-2018T01:26:39,FenceEqualizer,Hey Sage can I post a youtube link to Saitama vs superman?
27-07-2018T01:26:43,SageSaga,was collecting the particles that once made him who he was from the scattered universe by somehow maintaining his mind after being dematerialized
27-07-2018T01:26:58,SageSaga,sure
27-07-2018T01:27:41,FenceEqualizer,Think the person did a good job at capturing how a fight between them would go
27-07-2018T01:27:46,unsteddyphoenix,Is he like that deadpool character with the power of luck?
27-07-2018T01:28:01,ZRO4825,Deadpool has the power of breaking the 4th wall.
27-07-2018T01:28:03,SageSaga,Dr Manhattan?
27-07-2018T01:28:05,ZRO4825,Repeatedly.
27-07-2018T01:28:14,FenceEqualizer,Forever ignored
27-07-2018T01:28:19,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, if he manipulates probability..."
27-07-2018T01:28:28,SageSaga,"Fence- i said ""Sure"""
27-07-2018T01:28:30,Bgrmystr2,sagae answered you fence
27-07-2018T01:28:30,ZRO4825,"Fence, he said sure"

27-07-2018T02:28:03,Dadrobit,Inigo has a line where he asks you how many soul gems you can fit in your mouth.
27-07-2018T02:28:04,BadFoMo,...O ...k?
27-07-2018T02:28:12,Dadrobit,His record is 6.

27-07-2018T18:59:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom out of curiosity were you watching Mark as he was live

27-07-2018T22:34:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Well I‚Äôm just back to waiting anyway
27-07-2018T22:34:40,SpazztasticKiwi,That text thing Mark got set up takes time to send it‚Äôs link
27-07-2018T22:38:08,BadFoMo,The what?
27-07-2018T22:40:29,TheBeckoner,"Hey Tom, have you ever watched any of Jojo? Just curious."
27-07-2018T22:41:04,TheBeckoner,Jojo's Bizzare Adventure that is
27-07-2018T22:54:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"Oh Mark announced yesterday a phone number that he says is his. As for his legit home number? I doubt it, but it‚Äôs apparently linked to his control"
27-07-2018T22:55:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"He explained that it‚Äôs for contacting local people whenever he does another van video or meet up, as well as get direct feedback and conversation with fans"
27-07-2018T23:06:42,TheGamePlayer,Oh that was yesterday!?!?!
27-07-2018T23:07:06,TheGamePlayer,I stumbled apon that by as accident lol
27-07-2018T23:32:43,TheGamePlayer,Find out in a public area that way nothing bad will happen
27-07-2018T23:32:51,SpazztasticKiwi,At least the past month. She says he looks to be in his 60s
27-07-2018T23:33:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"My old pastor, who has a way to contact me"
27-07-2018T23:34:33,TheGamePlayer,Like the bat signal?
27-07-2018T23:34:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"And my grandpa, who lives in California and also has my contact"
27-07-2018T23:34:39,TheBeckoner,maybe he hyas alzheimer's and just keeps coming in
27-07-2018T23:34:43,TheBeckoner,has*
27-07-2018T23:35:00,TheGamePlayer,Hyaz XD
27-07-2018T23:35:31,TheGamePlayer,*he-as that's how you say that
27-07-2018T23:35:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"He knows information about me to warrant curiosity: where I worked last, where I work now, and my sister‚Äôs name, but"
27-07-2018T23:35:45,TheBeckoner,I woke up at 6 today
27-07-2018T23:35:53,TheBeckoner,brain power is low
27-07-2018T23:36:14,TheGamePlayer,That's ok we all do it
27-07-2018T23:36:32,TheGamePlayer,Not the stalking but the bad grammar
27-07-2018T23:36:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"If he really knows me, I feel he should have an ability to get into contact with me"
27-07-2018T23:36:48,TheBeckoner,Im gonna leave this open in case y'all make a break through on that stalker
27-07-2018T23:36:52,TheBeckoner,but im goin to bed
27-07-2018T23:36:58,TheBeckoner,Night yous
27-07-2018T23:37:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd guess it was my dad‚Äôs brother but he‚Äôs supposed to be in California too
27-07-2018T23:37:28,TheGamePlayer,I'ma watch YouTube so I'll check in like every five to ten mins.
27-07-2018T23:37:41,SpazztasticKiwi,And it makes no sense he‚Äôd contact me
27-07-2018T23:38:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Especially since his two sisters live here too
27-07-2018T23:38:43,TheGamePlayer,"Well I hope that they don't do anything and that your ok, even though I don't know anyone here I still care about people."
27-07-2018T23:39:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"If he does manage to run into me there one day, I‚Äôm protected by a counter"
27-07-2018T23:39:23,SpazztasticKiwi,And surveillance
27-07-2018T23:39:54,TheGamePlayer,"Cool, also get a can of pepper spray just in case"
27-07-2018T23:39:56,SpazztasticKiwi,And we have some general security as well as whoever else may be walking around at the time
27-07-2018T23:41:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"I do a lot of night work so running into me at work can be difficult, though my schedule varies sometimes. I park close to the front instead of the employee parking in the back corner anyway"
27-07-2018T23:41:37,TheGamePlayer,Well be safe be back in a few
27-07-2018T23:41:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless it‚Äôs someone worrisome or my dad‚Äôs brother I‚Äôm not awfully worried yet
27-07-2018T23:43:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Also my baby boy‚Äôs birthday is today
