18-05-2018T00:02:56,halloweenfoxy,hope not its awesome already lovely drfeamy
18-05-2018T00:03:01,halloweenfoxy,dreamy too
18-05-2018T00:03:19,SageSaga,the heck
18-05-2018T00:03:20,MallardDuckAvia,I think it would be better colored
18-05-2018T00:03:25,unsteddyphoenix,hope not?
18-05-2018T00:03:34,unsteddyphoenix,The sketch version would still exist you know~
18-05-2018T00:04:31,halloweenfoxy,yes  it would was only replying it most likely will be colored I just love sketches or pencil art in general
18-05-2018T00:05:35,MallardDuckAvia,I prefer color but usually just do black and white because I suck at coloring
18-05-2018T00:06:01,SageSaga,you dont get better by not doing it
18-05-2018T00:06:06,MallardDuckAvia,Why does tom flip the sketch while coloring it?
18-05-2018T00:06:27,SageSaga,hes not flipping it while coloring
18-05-2018T00:06:41,MallardDuckAvia,I color it sometimes but only when I have time and patience
18-05-2018T00:07:20,MallardDuckAvia,Airplanes are different to shade because they are shiney and stuff
18-05-2018T00:07:37,Bgrmystr2,"..why the hell would you hope it's not colored? It's already going to exist as a sketch, pus we get color version too. Is that like.. a bad thing?"
18-05-2018T00:07:56,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-confused: I don't..
18-05-2018T00:08:10,SageSaga,you flip a canvas while inking so you can see what you actually drew rather than what you think you drew
18-05-2018T00:08:22,MallardDuckAvia,Oh ok
18-05-2018T00:08:23,SageSaga,it lets you see the mistakes you made
18-05-2018T00:08:49,MallardDuckAvia,Makes sense
18-05-2018T00:09:04,SageSaga,https://twitter.com/kaeryi_/status/997134380907843587

18-05-2018T00:13:58,Twokinds,"Well, I think it's played once before on the stream"
18-05-2018T00:14:03,Twokinds,but it's pretty nice.
18-05-2018T00:14:13,Twokinds,Pretty new I mean.
18-05-2018T00:14:19,unsteddyphoenix,It is pretty nice though
18-05-2018T00:15:16,Bgrmystr2,first I recall hearing it
18-05-2018T00:15:18,Bgrmystr2,maybe I missed it
18-05-2018T00:16:08,Chippotatothefirst,"It may be off topic but I just broke my ankle a few days ago, do any of you know how to make the crutches hurt less?"
18-05-2018T00:16:13,Justanotheruser7118,I think im going crazy now
18-05-2018T00:16:34,unsteddyphoenix,Get some ones that dont feel pain
18-05-2018T00:16:37,Justanotheruser7118,"Is it me, or did Kat's eyes just blink"

18-05-2018T00:17:40,Bgrmystr2,when I had casts on both of my feet I asked for one of those walkers
18-05-2018T00:17:48,Bgrmystr2,cuz crutches destroyed my arms
18-05-2018T00:17:53,Bgrmystr2,you can try that
18-05-2018T00:18:08,Twokinds,"I've lived by it my whole life. As a result, my ankles are rock solid. Not broken once."
18-05-2018T00:18:32,Bgrmystr2,"same tom lol, never broke any bones"
18-05-2018T00:18:51,unsteddyphoenix,Imagine the stunts you could do if you just chose not to break your ankle
18-05-2018T00:18:53,Chippotatothefirst,"Yeah, I will see if I can, I have to walk a mile home so that would work better for the rubbing"
18-05-2018T00:18:57,CrimsonHelsing,me neither
18-05-2018T00:19:01,unsteddyphoenix,This is a whole new world for me. Brb jumping off my roof.

18-05-2018T00:20:36,Justanotheruser7118,wb Potato
18-05-2018T00:20:43,Twokinds,"It's like I told my brother. ""Don't break your arm."" but did he listen? No."

18-05-2018T00:21:31,MallardDuckAvia,What did I miss?
18-05-2018T00:21:36,Bgrmystr2,"that's a statement of good luck, Foxx lol"
18-05-2018T00:21:42,Bgrmystr2,least in showbusiness
18-05-2018T00:21:49,CrimsonHelsing,"when you do say that, say ""not literally though"""
18-05-2018T00:21:51,FoxxTrotter,Exactly.
18-05-2018T00:22:06,PotatoRights,Speaking of hurt ankles
18-05-2018T00:22:51,PotatoRights,"My dad just asked for me to run & get a sleeping bag, luckily I hurt it earlier"
18-05-2018T00:23:00,Chippotatothefirst,Funny thing is that when I broke it we had litteraly talked about how the tendons ligaments and bones break in your ankle in science
18-05-2018T00:23:20,Ordithus,Haha Eric doll looks very pleased
18-05-2018T00:23:23,Bgrmystr2,Tom with the closeup :ptv-ohmy::ok_hand:

18-05-2018T00:24:42,Bgrmystr2,"no, one is potato, one is chips"
18-05-2018T00:24:49,Bgrmystr2,there's a pretty big difference
18-05-2018T00:25:01,Bgrmystr2,or at least.. the first chip
18-05-2018T00:25:06,PotatoRights,"One is potato chips, one is potato rights"

18-05-2018T00:30:21,Chippotatothefirst,"Tom, what is the secret to your drawing? Is it practice and staying up all night or did you take a class?"
18-05-2018T00:30:21,Ordithus,"Maybe see ya tomorrow, Sage.  Maybe."
18-05-2018T00:30:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Ord
18-05-2018T00:30:22,Combak,"Well, it is kinda late."
18-05-2018T00:30:30,Bgrmystr2,yeh I guess
18-05-2018T00:30:32,Chippotatothefirst,Night
18-05-2018T00:30:58,Twokinds,A while lot of drawing
18-05-2018T00:31:03,Twokinds,whole
18-05-2018T00:31:40,Bgrmystr2,tom drew a whooooole lot
18-05-2018T00:31:45,Bgrmystr2,for many years
18-05-2018T00:31:52,Chippotatothefirst,About how much time before you became decent?
18-05-2018T00:31:54,PotatoRights,Sorry back
18-05-2018T00:31:57,Bgrmystr2,wb
18-05-2018T00:32:12,Twokinds,I guess that would probably depend on who you asked
18-05-2018T00:32:47,Twokinds,I think I started getting pretty good around 2012 or there abouts.
18-05-2018T00:33:07,PotatoRights,What was confirmed was the existance of arctic fox keidran
18-05-2018T00:33:19,Twokinds,"But you know, it's a constant process of gradual improvement."
18-05-2018T00:33:35,PotatoRights,Oh hi Tom
18-05-2018T00:33:43,SageSaga,Tom was almost always Decent- but he got really good much later- and then he catapulted when he started to get into even better backgrounds
18-05-2018T00:33:49,Chippotatothefirst,"Yeah, is it a  good career get into?"
18-05-2018T00:33:58,SageSaga,no
18-05-2018T00:34:00,Zakuru,true
18-05-2018T00:34:04,Twokinds,haha
18-05-2018T00:34:12,Zakuru,arting is hard works
18-05-2018T00:34:21,SageSaga,and doesnt pay well
18-05-2018T00:34:29,Twokinds,"For the amount of time, yeah, no."
18-05-2018T00:35:14,SageSaga,we do it because we love it- and cant see ourselves doing anything else
18-05-2018T00:35:26,Chippotatothefirst,"Lol, wait... how much sleep do you get? Or do you not"
18-05-2018T00:35:30,Chippotatothefirst,Oh
18-05-2018T00:35:38,Bgrmystr2,who sleeps anyway
18-05-2018T00:35:42,Bgrmystr2,:u
18-05-2018T00:35:47,SageSaga,anyone with half a brain
18-05-2018T00:35:49,Zakuru,i sleeps
18-05-2018T00:35:49,PotatoRights,That is the exact reason I am on video games so much sage
18-05-2018T00:35:52,Bgrmystr2,shhh sage :&lt;
18-05-2018T00:36:23,PotatoRights,Well gtg
18-05-2018T00:36:26,Bgrmystr2,always ruinin my sarcasm
18-05-2018T00:36:28,PotatoRights,Cya
18-05-2018T00:36:33,Bgrmystr2,seeya later
18-05-2018T00:36:39,SageSaga,dont you shush me- i'll do to you what i did to Ron
18-05-2018T00:36:49,Bgrmystr2,:(
18-05-2018T00:37:16,SageSaga,i will follow my mentors teaching
18-05-2018T00:37:25,ZRO4825,Why does no one understand that the counter to Mei is to actually SHOOT HER?!? o_O;
18-05-2018T00:37:27,Zakuru,i value sleeping more than eating
18-05-2018T00:37:39,Chippotatothefirst,Same
18-05-2018T00:37:47,Bgrmystr2,"your mentor's teachings, sage? what are those? ;o"
18-05-2018T00:37:55,Bgrmystr2,"lol Zro, they're too busy being frozen"
18-05-2018T00:37:56,Chippotatothefirst,Actually I don’t care for either
18-05-2018T00:38:09,SageSaga,"because thats a dickish thing to say Zro ""Well if you just shoot her-"" it's like in Dark Souls telling people ""Well you should just dodge"""
18-05-2018T00:38:22,Bgrmystr2,hahaha
18-05-2018T00:38:24,SageSaga,my mentor was The Green Goblin from Spiderman Movie 1
18-05-2018T00:38:33,Bgrmystr2,wat
18-05-2018T00:38:35,ZRO4825,"No, seriously, that's the counter to Mei. You actually shoot her. NO ONE wants to focus Mei, and then they all whine when she keeps freezing them. XD"
18-05-2018T00:38:37,Bgrmystr2,really?
18-05-2018T00:38:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,willem dafoe?
18-05-2018T00:38:49,SageSaga,"""THE HEART OSBORN! FIRST YOU GO FOR THE HEART!"""
18-05-2018T00:38:59,w0lfmare,"""Eventually they will hate you, why bother"""
18-05-2018T00:39:01,SageSaga,words to live by
18-05-2018T00:39:10,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: well, technically that does work."
18-05-2018T00:39:10,w0lfmare,Terrible advice
18-05-2018T00:39:47,SageSaga,Zro - that's not the counter- that's how you play the game
18-05-2018T00:40:06,SageSaga,just like dodge rolling in Darksouls and Monster Hunter
18-05-2018T00:40:12,Bgrmystr2,the shooting part? or the being frozen part?
18-05-2018T00:40:14,SageSaga,you dont tell people they just need to play the game
18-05-2018T00:41:30,ZRO4825,"Countering Mei is like asking how to counter a Jagras. Ya don't ""counter"" the silly thing, you just kill it. Solves the problem. :joy:"
18-05-2018T00:41:33,SageSaga,"the ""counter"" to Mei would be Orisa's personal defense power or using your movement ability to escape and focus on range"
18-05-2018T00:42:05,SageSaga,you dont engage her in close range- thats how she freezes you-
18-05-2018T00:42:18,Vatruvius,Still streaming huh?
18-05-2018T00:42:24,Bgrmystr2,vatru came back :D
18-05-2018T00:42:25,SageSaga,so your suggestion should be not to shoot her- but take advantage of her short range and slow rate of fire
18-05-2018T00:42:31,ZRO4825,"Well yeah, Sage, that's the idea, but it's hardly ever the reality, lol"
18-05-2018T00:42:54,Combak,"Well, it's pretty late."
18-05-2018T00:42:57,Combak,Night all!
18-05-2018T00:43:03,FoxxTrotter,"G'night, Combak."
18-05-2018T00:43:03,Bgrmystr2,gnight combak
18-05-2018T00:43:06,Vatruvius,"Ah, Nora Card."
18-05-2018T00:43:12,Bgrmystr2,yeah he finished the page
18-05-2018T00:43:15,Bgrmystr2,no text though
18-05-2018T00:43:20,Vatruvius,Eric plush is getting that Kat action...
18-05-2018T00:43:26,Bgrmystr2,probably text later
18-05-2018T00:43:31,Bgrmystr2,"indeed, yeah"
18-05-2018T00:43:42,Vatruvius,"Alright by me, I will read it tomorrow anyway."
18-05-2018T00:44:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Vat
18-05-2018T00:44:38,Bgrmystr2,uh.
18-05-2018T00:44:41,Vatruvius,?
18-05-2018T00:44:47,Vatruvius,I just got here?
18-05-2018T00:44:50,Vatruvius,Am I leaving?
18-05-2018T00:44:50,Bgrmystr2,marv.. are you drunk
18-05-2018T00:44:51,SageSaga,"Zro also - stick with the team- if Mei tries to ""ambush"" the entire team without an ult- shes gonna die"
18-05-2018T00:44:55,Bgrmystr2,I guess so vatru lol
18-05-2018T00:44:57,Bgrmystr2,xD
18-05-2018T00:45:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:) might have miss read
18-05-2018T00:45:01,Bgrmystr2,I'd hope not though
18-05-2018T00:45:14,ZRO4825,"That's advice that doesn't work quite so well anymore, Sage. She can freeze multiple people now. :("
18-05-2018T00:45:22,ZRO4825,"With her normal fire, I mean."
18-05-2018T00:45:22,Combak,"Night Foxx, Bgr."
18-05-2018T00:45:30,Combak,"Tom, Sage, thanks for streaming."
18-05-2018T00:45:41,Vatruvius,Nah...I have nothing else tonight. I will check with my friend though and see if he is still on and wants to play. If so then I might get off but I am also content just sitting her and resting...
18-05-2018T00:45:44,Vatruvius,On the fence.
18-05-2018T00:45:44,ZRO4825,"That being said, I fully agree with you, though, logically speaking the team should be moving together anyway"
18-05-2018T00:45:47,Twokinds,Thanks for watching
18-05-2018T00:45:49,SageSaga,when did that change? you usually cant hit more than one or two
18-05-2018T00:45:52,Combak,"See you all Sunday, if I can get away from the party long enough to say anything! XD"
18-05-2018T00:46:16,ZRO4825,"They changed her normal left-click a patch or two ago, the shot pierces through the initial target to hit anyone else in its range now"
18-05-2018T00:46:44,Vatruvius,You guys talking LoL or some type of MOBA?
18-05-2018T00:46:49,Bgrmystr2,Overwatch
18-05-2018T00:46:49,SageSaga,no
18-05-2018T00:46:52,ZRO4825,"So, she potentially CAN freeze a whole team, if they're all bunched up and ignore her long enough"
18-05-2018T00:46:57,Vatruvius,"Ah, Overwatch."
18-05-2018T00:47:20,Vatruvius,I have been demanded to buy Overwatch...
18-05-2018T00:47:28,Vatruvius,I am considering it...in time.
18-05-2018T00:47:30,ZRO4825,"Yeah. I rather enjoy Overwatch, but my goodness sometimes the people ya get stuck with make it...interesting, lol"
18-05-2018T00:47:34,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: how does someone demand you buy it?
18-05-2018T00:47:51,ZRO4825,"Kinda like how I've demanded that you buy things on Steam, Bgr"
18-05-2018T00:48:01,Bgrmystr2,and I've bought zero of them :V
18-05-2018T00:48:03,ZRO4825,"""You need to get this!"" ""Well, yeah, buuuut."" ""No excuses. You buy."""
18-05-2018T00:48:04,Bgrmystr2,cuz I have no money
18-05-2018T00:48:07,ZRO4825,I can still demand!
18-05-2018T00:48:10,Vatruvius,"Like this, ""BUY OVERWATCH OR WE ARE NO LONGER FRIENDS!"""
18-05-2018T00:48:11,ZRO4825,Doesn't mean you'll listen. :V
18-05-2018T00:48:15,Bgrmystr2,haha
18-05-2018T00:48:18,SageSaga,i was too good at overwatch so i stopped playing it and moved on to more advanced games
18-05-2018T00:48:18,Bgrmystr2,true
18-05-2018T00:48:29,Bgrmystr2,now sage plays the artist game
18-05-2018T00:48:41,ZRO4825,"Sage, we know that's a lie, because otherwise you'd be in OWL making more money than you make now. :P"
18-05-2018T00:48:41,Bgrmystr2,much more difficult
18-05-2018T00:48:56,ZRO4825,Bgr ain't wrong on the difficulty though. :joy:
18-05-2018T00:49:03,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
18-05-2018T00:49:17,SageSaga,most people give up after a few tries
18-05-2018T00:49:21,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, I think you're doin fine w/ this artist game"
18-05-2018T00:49:31,Bgrmystr2,@sage I mean
18-05-2018T00:49:36,ZRO4825,I have not given up on my artist game.
18-05-2018T00:49:42,Bgrmystr2,good zro
18-05-2018T00:49:43,ZRO4825,I am however...approaching it cautiously.
18-05-2018T00:49:45,SageSaga,"they start making up things like ""Talent"" to explain why they arent good at it"
18-05-2018T00:49:57,Vatruvius,"A literal game where you have to draw whatever the game prompts and it scores it. Of course, the point will be to annoy artists because every artist has their own way to express what ever it is they are drawing."
18-05-2018T00:49:59,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
18-05-2018T00:50:00,Mihari,"I was too good at overwatch, then Mercy took a nerf to the knee. T_T"
18-05-2018T00:50:11,ZRO4825,lol Mihari
18-05-2018T00:50:15,Bgrmystr2,Mihari used to be a healer like you..
18-05-2018T00:50:17,SageSaga,several nerfs to the knee actually
18-05-2018T00:50:26,Vatruvius,"No Mihari, no!"
18-05-2018T00:50:32,Vatruvius,Not the knee!
18-05-2018T00:50:38,ZRO4825,"I'm a Moira main myself it seems anymore. Either Moira, Rein, or Orisa o_O;  (I fill way too much at times)"
18-05-2018T00:50:43,Vatruvius,Anything but the knee!
18-05-2018T00:50:51,Mihari,"I generally tend to lean towards healer roles in general in all games, but I tend to have a knack for all roles."
18-05-2018T00:50:52,BrunoYcaro,Back
18-05-2018T00:50:58,Bgrmystr2,wb
18-05-2018T00:50:59,Zakuru,dps
18-05-2018T00:51:08,ZRO4825,I hear Mihari is a mean sniper.
18-05-2018T00:51:16,Zakuru,why did i read stripper
18-05-2018T00:51:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
18-05-2018T00:51:23,Justanotheruser7118,wut
18-05-2018T00:51:25,ZRO4825,Because you got your NSFW glasses on
18-05-2018T00:51:27,Vatruvius,I play a killer healer in Dreadnought. Never thought I would like it but I was really good at it.
18-05-2018T00:51:28,Mihari,Cause I do no how to pole dance? :P
18-05-2018T00:51:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,blmae fluff
18-05-2018T00:51:31,SageSaga,Mihari used to be a godtier sniper- shes still great but she cant do it as long as she used to
18-05-2018T00:51:34,Bgrmystr2,"I.. I mean.. I could potentially explain that one, Zak"
18-05-2018T00:51:37,Bgrmystr2,but I won't
18-05-2018T00:51:43,Zakuru,:3c
18-05-2018T00:51:45,FoxxTrotter,"Sniper, Mihari, not stripper."
18-05-2018T00:51:54,FoxxTrotter,Hehe.
18-05-2018T00:51:59,ZRO4825,Mihari the pole-dancing healing sniper?
18-05-2018T00:52:04,Mihari,"Why not both, lose a pieace after each kill!"
18-05-2018T00:52:10,Bgrmystr2,the sniper IS the pole
18-05-2018T00:52:12,ZRO4825,XD
18-05-2018T00:52:15,Mihari,And I can't type tonight T_T
18-05-2018T00:52:16,Justanotheruser7118,"Im alright at sniping, as long as the enemy is right in front of me"
18-05-2018T00:52:25,Justanotheruser7118,*pew*
18-05-2018T00:52:27,Zakuru,Miharu: *360 pole no scope*
18-05-2018T00:52:33,Chippotatothefirst,"Well, I gtg, keep up the good work Tom"
18-05-2018T00:52:37,ZRO4825,lol
18-05-2018T00:52:43,Bgrmystr2,hahaha zak

18-05-2018T00:52:49,Justanotheruser7118,lol
18-05-2018T00:52:50,Zakuru,:thinking:
18-05-2018T00:52:50,Vatruvius,"Mihari's heal ability, a quick pole dance equals +35% HP and a 12% damage boost."
18-05-2018T00:52:51,Bgrmystr2,seeya chip
18-05-2018T00:52:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Love to see that Zak XD
18-05-2018T00:52:59,Zakuru,challenge accepted
18-05-2018T00:52:59,ZRO4825,:thinking: Maybe I need to put in a request to Fluff

18-05-2018T00:53:03,Zakuru,"mihari, send me refs"

18-05-2018T00:53:22,ZRO4825,"Zaku, there's Mihari everywhere on FA. Finding refs for her ain't too hard. :P"
18-05-2018T00:53:29,Zakuru,sfw refs
18-05-2018T00:53:34,ZRO4825,Actually...I think Fluff did an actual ref sheet of Mihari once...
18-05-2018T00:53:43,Bgrmystr2,he did I believe
18-05-2018T00:53:43,FoxxTrotter,He did.
18-05-2018T00:53:44,Zakuru,also idk who mihari is XD
18-05-2018T00:53:45,SageSaga,i think twice
18-05-2018T00:53:45,ZRO4825,"okay, now you're just being too demanding, wth, SFW, what's wrong with you? :P"
18-05-2018T00:53:55,Bgrmystr2,"She's .. in the chat, Zak"
18-05-2018T00:53:58,Bgrmystr2,and has been talking

18-05-2018T00:54:08,Bgrmystr2,..the same person?
18-05-2018T00:54:16,ZRO4825,"Crazy cheetah lady. Minus the crazy, actually."
18-05-2018T00:54:25,Bgrmystr2,Mihari is just a persona of Mihari
18-05-2018T00:54:29,Bgrmystr2,:u
18-05-2018T00:54:31,ZRO4825,Sexy cheetah lady? :thinking: Yus.

18-05-2018T00:54:43,Bgrmystr2,there's nothing else xD
18-05-2018T00:55:04,Zakuru,i would explain further but its dumb x3
18-05-2018T00:55:16,Zakuru,"but, challenge accepted"
18-05-2018T00:55:25,Zakuru,i'd probably have it done... sunday? :thinking:
18-05-2018T00:55:29,SageSaga,Mihari has permission to put a link
18-05-2018T00:55:41,Mihari,http://mihari.me/widow-scary-lady/
18-05-2018T00:55:45,Vatruvius,"Why is Eric plush smiling, real Eric would not even think of it as anything worth acknowledging."
18-05-2018T00:55:46,Bgrmystr2,Mihari links here we go :u
18-05-2018T00:55:48,Mihari,Sorry if it's slow to load.
18-05-2018T00:56:21,Vatruvius,"What is this, slow internet...agh!"
18-05-2018T00:56:30,Vatruvius,Says the man with AT&T DSL
18-05-2018T00:56:37,Justanotheruser7118,Where's the server at?
18-05-2018T00:56:51,Mihari,It's just not optimized for video streaming T_T
18-05-2018T00:56:58,SageSaga,yeah its High res
18-05-2018T00:57:22,Mihari,Yah it's the full 1080 video XD
18-05-2018T00:57:28,Bgrmystr2,lool it loads like one frame every 15 then loads the next one frame
18-05-2018T00:57:35,Vatruvius,^
18-05-2018T00:57:36,Bgrmystr2,15 seconds*
18-05-2018T00:57:54,Mihari,I've been too lazy to put it on youtube.
18-05-2018T00:57:54,Justanotheruser7118,I'll just wait till the end of stream for it to load
18-05-2018T00:57:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,just gonna let this buffer over night ;-;
18-05-2018T00:58:01,Bgrmystr2,haha
18-05-2018T00:58:07,Bgrmystr2,"I kinda feel the same, marv"
18-05-2018T00:58:10,Mihari,Wait I might be able to fix this
18-05-2018T00:58:30,Vatruvius,I don't think it is buffering passively...
18-05-2018T00:58:39,Bgrmystr2,"it is, vatru"
18-05-2018T00:58:47,FoxxTrotter,"I have an early outing in the morning, so I'm off to bed. G'night, everyone. :cfoxxtrotter-giphy:"
18-05-2018T00:58:51,Vatruvius,I will test.
18-05-2018T00:58:54,Bgrmystr2,I left it paused for a bit and it played for a few seconds
18-05-2018T00:58:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Foxx

18-05-2018T00:59:02,Mihari,There that should work just fine
18-05-2018T00:59:16,FoxxTrotter,All day FD fundraiser with chicken and pork barbecue. Mmmm... :0)
18-05-2018T00:59:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Much better
18-05-2018T00:59:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,nice shot at the end
18-05-2018T00:59:40,Vatruvius,Definitely better.
18-05-2018T00:59:56,Mihari,That Genji tried 3 times to come that way
18-05-2018T01:00:02,Bgrmystr2,"Every time I click it, it opens with a white screen, come on browser why are you being garbage &gt;:T"
18-05-2018T01:00:02,Vatruvius,"However, my AT&T DSL is trying to do both the stream and the video, it cannot decide which."
18-05-2018T01:00:26,Justanotheruser7118,So how many hrs so far Mihari?
18-05-2018T01:00:52,Mihari,As Widow?
18-05-2018T01:01:00,Vatruvius,I just have a feeling that if I get Overwatch I will become good at it...
18-05-2018T01:01:18,Justanotheruser7118,idk like the total amount of time
18-05-2018T01:01:27,Mihari,"Oh, 298 hours"
18-05-2018T01:01:30,Mihari,24 as Widow
18-05-2018T01:01:30,ZRO4825,:joy: That poor Genji
18-05-2018T01:01:34,Vatruvius,Kinda like CoD which ended with either team carries or just straight up garbage team that died to fast for me to carry.
18-05-2018T01:01:47,Justanotheruser7118,O_o
18-05-2018T01:01:48,Bgrmystr2,OH That last shot

18-05-2018T01:01:56,Bgrmystr2,nicely done
18-05-2018T01:02:14,Vatruvius,"Wow! Um, the most hours I have in any game is Rainbow Six Siege."
18-05-2018T01:02:22,Mihari,"I wish I had better examples, cause sometimes I own the field XD"
18-05-2018T01:02:41,Mihari,But other times my hands won't let me play widow
18-05-2018T01:02:44,Vatruvius,291 hours
18-05-2018T01:02:45,SageSaga,yeah ive seen it where you killed the entire team

18-05-2018T01:03:16,ZRO4825,"I've had my moments with Widow/Hanzo, but most times I feel like I'm just letting myself down, let alone my team, lol"
18-05-2018T01:03:20,Bgrmystr2,that's just about how much time I put on a game if I play it casually
18-05-2018T01:03:31,TheBeckoner,heh 4500 in fallout 4
18-05-2018T01:03:34,TheBeckoner,heyop
18-05-2018T01:03:38,Mihari,3457 hours in Star Trek Online
18-05-2018T01:03:38,TheBeckoner,heyo*
18-05-2018T01:03:48,Bgrmystr2,yeah I've got several games with over 4k+ hours
18-05-2018T01:03:49,SageSaga,the point is - Mihari is doing stuff like that with Nerve Damage in her hands
18-05-2018T01:04:00,Vatruvius,"Yeah, I am not that hardcore of a gamer. I do a lot of other things. But I still love Siege and play it normally."
18-05-2018T01:04:07,TheBeckoner,oops 4.7k hours in fo4
18-05-2018T01:04:12,Vatruvius,At least if my keyboard would stop breaking!
18-05-2018T01:04:20,Bgrmystr2,still impressive
18-05-2018T01:04:26,Bgrmystr2,mouse/keyboard yes?
18-05-2018T01:04:30,Bgrmystr2,@Mihari
18-05-2018T01:04:36,Mihari,Yes
18-05-2018T01:04:41,Bgrmystr2,thought so
18-05-2018T01:04:48,SageSaga,"i have 500 hours in MHW, 400 hours in MHGen and 450 hours in MH4U"
18-05-2018T01:05:30,ZRO4825,I think I'm going to play some more Super Punch-Out. Then get on MHW.
18-05-2018T01:05:41,Vatruvius,"Y'all are older than me so you would have more hours in certain games. Plus, I cannot just sit and focus one game. That being said, I have yet to delve into Witcher 3, I know that is going to become my time sink in the future."
18-05-2018T01:06:27,ZRO4825,"I mean, if we really wanna talk hours...anyone else know their played time in FFXI? :joy:"
18-05-2018T01:06:30,Twokinds,27000 hours in photoshop.
18-05-2018T01:06:47,ZRO4825,Tom AFK Bazaars in photoshop. :V
18-05-2018T01:06:49,Vatruvius,"Tom please, you are on photoshop a lot."
18-05-2018T01:06:50,EV127,Best game ever
18-05-2018T01:08:05,Bgrmystr2,XD Tom
18-05-2018T01:08:22,Bgrmystr2,Do you have an actual counter for this timestamp?
18-05-2018T01:08:23,SageSaga,if i had a way to tell how much i use my art programs i think i would just beat out Tom-
18-05-2018T01:08:45,TorqueEmUp,The fact that Witcher 3 is so massive is why I haven't played it.
18-05-2018T01:09:15,TorqueEmUp,and have no desire to start anytime soon.
18-05-2018T01:09:26,ZRO4825,I'm still trying to get myself to finish GTA V. And START the Witcher series.
18-05-2018T01:09:42,ZRO4825,And I still need to finish getting at least to Hunter Rank 100 in MHW. @.@
18-05-2018T01:11:13,TorqueEmUp,"I have beat GTA V, a long time ago. Back when the only versions you could get were the 360 and PS3 versions"
18-05-2018T01:11:39,Vatruvius,Tom...please...to much tease with that plush. :dizzy_face:
18-05-2018T01:12:14,TorqueEmUp,I still need to finish Red Dead
18-05-2018T01:12:37,Vatruvius,Angry Keith.
18-05-2018T01:12:46,TorqueEmUp,I think that might be the next game I play.
18-05-2018T01:13:04,TorqueEmUp,"Finished Undead Nightmare, but never the main game."
18-05-2018T01:14:38,TorqueEmUp,luckily I can now play it on the X in 4k without the framerate tanking.
18-05-2018T01:15:50,Vatruvius,"I have been playing around in Hexels 3 lately, been working on my Discord channel logo. Already 17 hours in with a result that I have already added and now started fresh with a new, similar idea."
18-05-2018T01:16:03,Vatruvius,Learning new stuff each hour on average.
18-05-2018T01:17:02,TorqueEmUp,"Finished Dust today finally. 116% completion,"
18-05-2018T01:17:26,Vatruvius,How can you be more than 100% with anything!? That is not how percentages work!!!!!
18-05-2018T01:17:37,TorqueEmUp,*shrug
18-05-2018T01:17:39,ZRO4825,"Actually they can, and do :3"
18-05-2018T01:18:08,Alphawolf333,In DK64 its cause theres actually more than the game anticipated you to be able to get
18-05-2018T01:18:14,Twokinds,"Huh, better than me. I think I only got 113%"
18-05-2018T01:18:20,Vatruvius,"Not talking about percentage gain in profit or anything. When saying you are done with some like 89% done, you cannot be more than 100% complete."
18-05-2018T01:18:39,TorqueEmUp,yeah I think the max you can get in Dust is 117%
18-05-2018T01:19:01,SageSaga,brb - gotta fix some dinner before it gets too late
18-05-2018T01:19:12,Mihari,Nuts I should have asked to be a plushie
18-05-2018T01:19:15,TorqueEmUp,"I didn't bother getting all the treasures in the final area, as I knew the game was ending, and I didn't need to really gather anything."
18-05-2018T01:19:40,Vatruvius,"Ask Mihari, will be a Tom addition to the card."
18-05-2018T01:19:43,Vatruvius,I am for it.
18-05-2018T01:19:45,Vatruvius,:D
18-05-2018T01:19:55,TorqueEmUp,That final boss though. Hoo boy
18-05-2018T01:19:59,TorqueEmUp,Good stuff
18-05-2018T01:20:05,Mihari,"Nah, dun want to give Tom and more extra work XD"
18-05-2018T01:20:22,Mihari,Even if he was for it XD
18-05-2018T01:21:18,Vatruvius,"New sketch suggestion, Mihari plush."
18-05-2018T01:25:21,TorqueEmUp,Oh yeah sketch ideas. I've got an interesting one this week. Someone Tom hasn't drawn  (to my knowledge) in 12 years. :P
18-05-2018T01:25:36,Vatruvius,Witch Kat creates voodoo Mihari plush...
18-05-2018T01:25:43,Bgrmystr2,"back, had to afk a bit"
18-05-2018T01:25:51,Bgrmystr2,doesn't seem like I missed much
18-05-2018T01:26:03,TorqueEmUp,indeed
18-05-2018T01:27:42,Vatruvius,"No, no comment on the Mihari plush?"
18-05-2018T01:27:51,Bgrmystr2,nope

18-05-2018T01:28:32,Bgrmystr2,I can think of lots of other plushes I'd rather have
18-05-2018T01:28:44,Vatruvius,For a sketch...
18-05-2018T01:28:55,Vatruvius,Not a real plush.
18-05-2018T01:29:03,Vatruvius,I fell like that would be creepy.
18-05-2018T01:29:06,Bgrmystr2,"I'm not tom or sage, so I don't really.."
18-05-2018T01:29:07,Bgrmystr2,xD

18-05-2018T01:40:30,HeresyArtStream,hi all!
18-05-2018T01:40:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,HI Heresy
18-05-2018T01:40:45,Sammit,Hi Heresy
18-05-2018T01:40:56,Twokinds,Hi Heresy
18-05-2018T01:41:18,SageSaga,Tom - have you seen all the Marvel Movies you need to?
18-05-2018T01:41:23,Bgrmystr2,Heya Heresy
18-05-2018T01:41:28,Twokinds,Uh...
18-05-2018T01:42:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,which movies do you need to watch?
18-05-2018T01:42:27,Twokinds,not yet
18-05-2018T01:42:51,SageSaga,"Thor Ragnarok, Civil War, and if you have time Black Panther but it's not as Vital"
18-05-2018T01:43:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,all three of those are awesome movies
18-05-2018T01:43:38,SageSaga,the most important is Thor
18-05-2018T01:43:52,TorqueEmUp,Ehh kinda
18-05-2018T01:44:06,TorqueEmUp,for about the first 10 minutes :P
18-05-2018T01:44:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Thor and civil are pretty needed
18-05-2018T01:44:42,TorqueEmUp,Civil War definitely
18-05-2018T01:50:13,Twokinds,What about the one where they're fighting each other. Is that needed?
18-05-2018T01:50:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-keifacepalm:
18-05-2018T01:50:34,SageSaga,that was Civil war - but i think you knew that
18-05-2018T01:50:39,Bgrmystr2,that's the civil war one..
18-05-2018T01:50:46,Bgrmystr2,xD
18-05-2018T01:51:12,Twokinds,Yeah Civil War was one of the ones I'd already seen.
18-05-2018T01:51:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,have you seen Thor Ragnarok?
18-05-2018T01:52:09,Twokinds,Is that the one where they're fighting each other?
18-05-2018T01:52:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Its more the one were Thor is likable
18-05-2018T01:53:04,SageSaga,(Technically Thor and Hulk do fight each other though)
18-05-2018T01:53:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,thats true
18-05-2018T01:53:22,SageSaga,(But they did that in Avengers as well)
18-05-2018T01:54:05,Twokinds,Spoilers!
18-05-2018T01:54:18,Bgrmystr2,LOL
18-05-2018T01:54:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
18-05-2018T01:54:25,SageSaga,it was in the trailer- both of em
18-05-2018T01:54:35,Twokinds,I haven't seen the trailers!
18-05-2018T01:54:40,Bgrmystr2,Is there a movie where they.. aren't fighting each other?
18-05-2018T01:54:49,Twokinds,I didn't even know the hulk was in Thor
18-05-2018T01:54:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Iron man 1
18-05-2018T01:54:51,Bgrmystr2,"in some way, shape or form"
18-05-2018T01:54:59,SageSaga,Thor 2
18-05-2018T01:55:06,SageSaga,and Thor
18-05-2018T01:55:17,Bgrmystr2,hm
18-05-2018T01:56:07,SageSaga,and Thor didnt fight Hulk in Avengers 2
18-05-2018T01:56:12,SageSaga,but Tony did fight him-
18-05-2018T01:56:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,that was fun
18-05-2018T01:56:45,Bgrmystr2,that's a fun fight to warch
18-05-2018T01:57:02,Bgrmystr2,"Tony's ""sorry"" gets me every time"
18-05-2018T01:57:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
18-05-2018T01:57:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"also the ""How quickly can we buy this building"""
18-05-2018T01:57:43,Bgrmystr2,xD
18-05-2018T01:57:54,Bgrmystr2,prettymuch immediately
18-05-2018T01:58:43,Twokinds,Ok
18-05-2018T01:58:48,Twokinds,"3am, I think I'm done for tongiht."
18-05-2018T01:58:55,Twokinds,I'll be finishing this up later.
18-05-2018T01:59:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Awesome work Tom, Thanks for the stram"
18-05-2018T01:59:43,Justanotheruser7118,Welp good night  guys

18-05-2018T02:00:22,Sammit,Thanks for the stream Tom
18-05-2018T02:00:25,InTheLionsDen,"Thanks for the stream, Tom"
18-05-2018T02:00:26,xXGamingXx,BB Tom
18-05-2018T02:00:31,Bgrmystr2,Can't wait fot the text on this'
18-05-2018T02:00:40,Bgrmystr2,and it's gone
18-05-2018T02:00:48,ZRO4825,lol
18-05-2018T02:00:50,Twokinds,So tired
18-05-2018T02:01:01,iliar,"Good night, Tom."
18-05-2018T02:13:52,CrimsonHelsing,"Very well done Tom, you've earned the rest. Thanks for the stream, and see you on Sunday!"
18-05-2018T02:34:42,SageSaga,wth
18-05-2018T02:34:47,Bgrmystr2,the fok was that
18-05-2018T02:34:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,?
18-05-2018T02:35:02,SageSaga,ah crap - it was a video ad on AI
18-05-2018T02:35:07,Bgrmystr2,oh
18-05-2018T02:35:15,SageSaga,i hate those things T_T
18-05-2018T02:35:27,Twokinds,Video ad? From PW?
18-05-2018T02:35:59,SageSaga,no - the new comment thing we have- the old one had em too but we got them to turn them off
18-05-2018T02:36:21,SageSaga,but in their place we got a bunch of terrible click bait ads
18-05-2018T02:36:41,Twokinds,"Wait, really? The comment system itself has built in ads?"
18-05-2018T02:36:46,SageSaga,yep
18-05-2018T02:36:55,Twokinds,That's weird.
18-05-2018T02:37:45,SageSaga,its because its handled by a different developer - it has more options and better formatting than the Wordpress comment thing
18-05-2018T02:38:18,DarthRexKing,I am going to bed. Goodnight.
18-05-2018T02:38:41,SageSaga,that said- the ads occasionally cause poor loading on the page too! which is completely unacceptable T_T
18-05-2018T02:38:50,Twokinds,gnight darth
18-05-2018T02:39:04,Twokinds,"Yeah, I'd want a comment system that isn't tied to someone else."
18-05-2018T02:39:06,ZRO4825,"Yeah, I already alerted Id 'bout'em doing autoplay ads"
18-05-2018T02:39:40,SageSaga,i told Mihari about it but she didnt say anything
18-05-2018T02:39:55,DarthRexKing,Later.
18-05-2018T02:40:34,SageSaga,get this- there is also an X button on the ad to get rid of it too- but the X disappears like a few seconds after it loads
18-05-2018T02:40:51,Bgrmystr2,._.
18-05-2018T02:40:56,SageSaga,often causing you to accidentally click the link
18-05-2018T02:41:25,Twokinds,I'd take a free system over something like that.
18-05-2018T02:41:33,Bgrmystr2,is the x actually able to close the ad? or is it just part of the ad but deceptively looking like a way to close it?
18-05-2018T02:41:45,Twokinds,Or just a plug-in you can pay for.
18-05-2018T02:41:47,SageSaga,if you click it in time it does remove the ad
18-05-2018T02:41:51,Bgrmystr2,ah okay
18-05-2018T02:41:53,SageSaga,and stop it from running anything
18-05-2018T02:42:22,Bgrmystr2,I've seen ads that include a little x or whatever at the top right of it to make ppl think it's to close the ad.. and the x is part of the ad..
18-05-2018T02:42:26,Bgrmystr2,it's shitty :/
18-05-2018T02:42:48,SageSaga,i dunno Tom- there was some benefit for using these things that Mihari thinks is worth it so there's gotta be a good reason
18-05-2018T02:43:06,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
18-05-2018T02:43:46,SageSaga,maybe the built in Free Wordpress commenting can be exploited to inject code into the site
18-05-2018T02:44:03,Bgrmystr2,possible
18-05-2018T02:44:15,Twokinds,"I could see that, if it's not being maintained."
18-05-2018T02:44:18,Bgrmystr2,the ads can't though? cuz lots of ads do that kinda thing
18-05-2018T02:45:40,SageSaga,the ads cant inject code into the website- but yeah malicious ads could contain data downloaded onto those viewing it- but at the very least we have some kinda relationship with the creator of this thing
18-05-2018T02:46:00,SageSaga,so im sure they have something on their end to stop stuff like that
18-05-2018T02:48:17,SageSaga,I just hope we didnt drop Disqus just to go to something just as bad
18-05-2018T02:48:30,ZRO4825,"I liked Disqus myself as a comment system, lol"
18-05-2018T02:48:35,ZRO4825,But obviously I'm just on the user side of it~
18-05-2018T02:48:46,SageSaga,did you see the ads on it?
18-05-2018T02:49:16,ZRO4825,Not really to be honest
18-05-2018T02:49:44,SageSaga,that question was a double edge sword- if you didnt see the ads then you probably are using ad blocker -
18-05-2018T02:49:45,ZRO4825,"I DID notice it was throwing in one about every 4-6 comments on some comics though, but other than that no"
18-05-2018T02:49:53,ZRO4825,"Nope, got Katbox whitelisted"
18-05-2018T02:50:15,Bgrmystr2,I use an adblocker to protect me from shitty ads that make my antivirus active shield lose it's mind.
18-05-2018T02:50:27,Bgrmystr2,happens all the time even on sites that I'd consider safe
18-05-2018T02:50:36,ZRO4825,"I'm GOOD at ignoring ads as long as they're not the annoying autoplay video ones, or pop-up hijackers and crap"
18-05-2018T02:50:40,Bgrmystr2,especially ads that auto-play
18-05-2018T02:51:08,ZRO4825,autoplay ads are what made me start using adblockers to begin with
18-05-2018T02:51:20,ZRO4825,"If the ads wanna be there, that's cool, just stay on the side out of my way and don't be a pest :V"
18-05-2018T02:51:25,SageSaga,"here's a few example of the ads - ""Do you have cancer? Click here to find out"" ""Use these top 10 tricks to make a woman love you"" ""You wont believe what happened to this woman"" *Picture of an abused woman*"
18-05-2018T02:51:35,Bgrmystr2,christ
18-05-2018T02:51:41,Bgrmystr2,that's the definition of clickbait
18-05-2018T02:51:58,ZRO4825,Isn't that what like 75% of ads are though?
18-05-2018T02:52:02,Bgrmystr2,not always
18-05-2018T02:52:12,SageSaga,you see my project wonderful ads?
18-05-2018T02:52:18,Bgrmystr2,cuz most ads for the most part actually advertise what they have on the tin
18-05-2018T02:52:19,ZRO4825,Yup
18-05-2018T02:52:23,SageSaga,most of them are like online click games and other comics-
18-05-2018T02:53:43,SageSaga,i may not care for some of them personally- but they arent click bait garbage
18-05-2018T02:53:59,Twokinds,Yeah that's why I like PW
18-05-2018T02:54:13,Twokinds,At least they have relevent ads
18-05-2018T02:55:02,SageSaga,i had a dream one time that i set up a Project Wonderful ad for AI - and the only site it showed up on was AI
18-05-2018T02:55:25,Bgrmystr2,xD
18-05-2018T02:55:29,Bgrmystr2,a lot of good that does..
18-05-2018T02:56:45,SageSaga,i told Tom about this one- but i had a dream not too long ago that we went to the convention and the bed at the hotel was so hard i couldnt sleep on it
18-05-2018T02:57:00,SageSaga,and i was freaking out because i wouldnt be able to sleep for 5 days straight
18-05-2018T02:57:42,Bgrmystr2,:/
18-05-2018T02:58:04,SageSaga,so we ordered a mattress from a Bed in a Box company ( I think it was Purple) and we had it ship same day delivery to the hotel
18-05-2018T02:58:35,SageSaga,and put that on the bed so i could sleep- and then we sent it back with their 100 day return policy
18-05-2018T02:59:00,SageSaga,and while i felt terrible for doing that i reasoned it was ok because when i got home i was just going to order another for my bed anyways
18-05-2018T02:59:30,SageSaga,(Which is actually the plan- when i get paid next month im going to order a new mattress because my current one has been causing me back pain)
18-05-2018T03:00:04,ZRO4825,Back pain is not fun stuff &gt;:(
18-05-2018T03:00:53,SageSaga,i need to pick out a mattress though
18-05-2018T03:01:21,SageSaga,the one i wanted to try first was Bear mattress but- they use some psudoscience bull crap in their promotions-
18-05-2018T03:01:37,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all.
18-05-2018T03:01:40,SageSaga,yo
18-05-2018T03:01:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi dad
18-05-2018T03:02:16,SageSaga,they claim they use a special material that promotes repairing muscle damage
18-05-2018T03:03:27,SageSaga,"and im like ""If this were real- we dont athletes and other people use this to wrap their legs or arms or body when they are injured? - oh right- because it's bull crap"""
18-05-2018T03:03:47,Bgrmystr2,lool
18-05-2018T03:03:56,Bgrmystr2,heya dadro
18-05-2018T03:05:25,SageSaga,i'd like to try the purple one but its the most expensive one
18-05-2018T03:05:33,MagicEnchilladas,~great the matress companies are breaking the statute of secrecy~
18-05-2018T03:09:40,SageSaga,i think the first one im gonna try is either the Cocoon Chill from Sealy or the Nectar
18-05-2018T03:13:32,SageSaga,the Nectar mattress has a low price and has a lifetime warranty and a full year trial period. If at any time within 365 days you can send it back for a full refund -
18-05-2018T03:14:19,Bgrmystr2,their beds look stiff as fuck from the images lol
18-05-2018T03:14:21,Bgrmystr2,xD
18-05-2018T03:14:38,Bgrmystr2,would have to feel it I guess
18-05-2018T03:14:42,SageSaga,dont know what you are looking at to think that's stiff
18-05-2018T03:14:57,Bgrmystr2,the beds on the BedInaBox website
18-05-2018T03:15:06,SageSaga,which bed?
18-05-2018T03:15:18,Bgrmystr2,"their entire ""matresses"" page"
18-05-2018T03:15:34,Bgrmystr2,every single one looks stiff
18-05-2018T03:15:48,SageSaga,bed in a box website?
18-05-2018T03:15:55,Bgrmystr2,yeah
18-05-2018T03:16:10,Bgrmystr2,I can link it if you want :o
18-05-2018T03:16:25,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno if it's the same one, but I didn't find anything else"
18-05-2018T03:16:35,SageSaga,bed in a box is what they call the type of mattress
18-05-2018T03:16:54,SageSaga,"there is a bunch of different types of ""Bed in a box"""
18-05-2018T03:17:14,Bgrmystr2,Well..  I'm looking at a company called that
18-05-2018T03:17:14,SageSaga,https://www.nectarsleep.com/
18-05-2018T03:17:47,Bgrmystr2,okay that is not the site I am looking at
18-05-2018T03:18:45,SageSaga,https://www.bearmattress.com/products/bearmattress
18-05-2018T03:19:30,Bgrmystr2,I see
18-05-2018T03:19:32,SageSaga,https://www.tuftandneedle.com/mattress/?size=tn23t
18-05-2018T03:19:59,SageSaga,https://www.cocoonbysealy.com/mattress/chill/
18-05-2018T03:20:07,SageSaga,this one uses a hot girl to sell its cool matress
18-05-2018T03:20:17,ZRO4825,:thinking:
18-05-2018T03:20:23,ZRO4825,We should try that with comics!
18-05-2018T03:20:24,ZRO4825,Oh...wait...
18-05-2018T03:20:33,Bgrmystr2,lool
18-05-2018T03:21:14,SageSaga,that said the cocoon chill has my attention because it apparently stays cool
18-05-2018T03:21:23,Bgrmystr2,"When I went and got a bed, I got a pillowtop mattress. Went to.. whatever store it was like 10 years ago or so and basically laid down on every bed they had in the store till I found one that didn't feel like I was sleeping on the floor"
18-05-2018T03:21:35,SageSaga,which is important in the summer and prevents the memory foam from going too soft
18-05-2018T03:21:58,ZRO4825,I think one of these days I'm just gonna get myself a mountain of beanbag chairs.
18-05-2018T03:22:01,ZRO4825,And sleep on that
18-05-2018T03:22:08,Bgrmystr2,beanbag chairs are not that comfortable
18-05-2018T03:22:10,SageSaga,that would be terrible
18-05-2018T03:22:12,ZRO4825,They are to me
18-05-2018T03:22:12,Bgrmystr2,I've had at least 4
18-05-2018T03:22:40,SageSaga,the best thing about all these mattresses is -
18-05-2018T03:22:53,SageSaga,low cost and they almost all have a 100 night trial
18-05-2018T03:23:20,SageSaga,or more- and most of them have a 10 year or longer warranty
18-05-2018T03:24:13,SageSaga,Nectar putting a 365 day trial and a life time warranty makes me think they must be good
18-05-2018T03:24:29,SageSaga,also they are cheap-
18-05-2018T03:24:44,ZRO4825,Either that or they've got a return process so convoluted that they assume you'll give up before you get it fully returned
18-05-2018T03:25:07,SageSaga,ive seen the reviews of the return- they said it's very easy
18-05-2018T03:25:35,SageSaga,and a lot only got a return because they wanted to upgrade to a larger mattress
18-05-2018T03:26:14,SageSaga,they seem to legit send someone to your home to repack and take it away
18-05-2018T03:26:42,SageSaga,since they gotta vacuum seal it or else it wont fit in the box XD
18-05-2018T03:27:45,MagicEnchilladas,yeah the worst reviews are just saying the delivery is kinda bad
18-05-2018T03:29:11,SageSaga,yeah since the initial delivery is by your usual postal groups- that dont want to lug around something this big XD
18-05-2018T03:29:35,SageSaga,and apparently the company is selling a lot of them so shipping them out is a task
18-05-2018T03:30:27,SageSaga,they went from being a relatively small company to one of the highest selling companies of their type very fast
18-05-2018T03:33:12,SageSaga,btw
18-05-2018T03:33:13,SageSaga,im done
18-05-2018T03:33:23,SageSaga,night yall! thanks for hanging out ^_^

18-05-2018T03:36:42,SageSaga,oh - also
18-05-2018T03:36:52,SageSaga,just read a review on one of these mattresses-
18-05-2018T03:36:59,SageSaga,and i wanna smack the person
18-05-2018T03:37:16,GigglingGhoul,why so?
18-05-2018T03:37:17,ZRO4825,"Normal smack, or a large trout?"
18-05-2018T03:37:41,SageSaga,"""We are not impressed by this mattress and will be requesting a refund as soon as I find a place to donate it to"""
18-05-2018T03:37:59,ZRO4825,blinks.

18-05-2018T03:38:38,Bgrmystr2,yeah.. that's not how refunds work

18-05-2018T03:40:28,ZRO4825,Possibly true....possibly worth...
18-05-2018T03:40:52,SageSaga,"XD! Best 1 Star review yet- ""Wife doesn't like the softness of the mattress. Will be returning it"""
18-05-2018T03:41:08,ZRO4825,LOL

18-05-2018T03:41:32,Bgrmystr2,That tells me the dude liked the mattress better than he did his wife

18-05-2018T03:41:44,Dadrobit,":/ To be fair, I'd want my wife to be comfortable sleeping with me as well."

18-05-2018T03:42:07,ZRO4825,That is why waifus &gt; wives. They don't argue! =D

18-05-2018T03:43:14,SageSaga,"it's like- seriously? You typed that on a computer or a phone, how did you miss that isn't how you spell MATTRESS?"""
18-05-2018T03:43:26,GigglingGhoul,I don't think these people know that a review is supposed to be helpful.
18-05-2018T03:43:37,SageSaga,especially since you type it on a site saying MATTRESS on it
18-05-2018T03:44:01,ZRO4825,XD
18-05-2018T03:44:24,Bgrmystr2,that kinda reminds me of all the yahoo answers in that video lool
18-05-2018T03:45:41,SageSaga,ya know-
18-05-2018T03:45:57,SageSaga,reading some of these negative reviews- i think they are sleeping on the wrong side of the mattress
18-05-2018T03:46:10,GigglingGhoul,pfft
18-05-2018T03:46:13,GigglingGhoul,maybe
18-05-2018T03:46:28,GigglingGhoul,they woke up on
18-05-2018T03:46:37,ZRO4825,lmao
18-05-2018T03:46:39,GigglingGhoul,the wrong side of the bed
18-05-2018T03:47:01,SageSaga,all the people saying the Tuft and Needle is way too hard and firm-
18-05-2018T03:47:49,SageSaga,im like- The Tuft and Needle has a large support foam on one side- if you sleep on that side- thats gotta feel tough
18-05-2018T03:49:03,SageSaga,this other one they are complaining about it sagging in the middle- how? the material cant sag if you have it on a flat- they probably have it on an old box spring or in a frame with no support in the middle!
18-05-2018T03:54:01,ZRO4825,It's that logic thing. Some people just ain't got it. :P
18-05-2018T11:08:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I actually feel like I’m not gonna die today
18-05-2018T14:15:17,Xexanoth,"that's good, i guess"
18-05-2018T14:28:58,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. that should be an everyday thing
18-05-2018T14:29:05,Bgrmystr2,unless Kiwi is in a hospital bed or  somethin every day
18-05-2018T14:40:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Not really but my sleep schedule’s been shot

18-05-2018T15:09:39,SiliconCarbide,"scary stuff, hopefully all remains quiet"
