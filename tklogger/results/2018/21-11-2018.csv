21-11-2018T02:36:03,RimaDraws,god flora's stripes were hard to draw
21-11-2018T03:15:27,Twokinds,They are
21-11-2018T03:15:30,Twokinds,Also I can't sleep
21-11-2018T03:18:31,unsteddyphoenix,They are indeed
21-11-2018T03:18:38,unsteddyphoenix,Is your bed...TOO comfortable for you?
21-11-2018T03:19:20,Twokinds,lol
21-11-2018T03:19:23,Twokinds,The best is comfy
21-11-2018T03:19:39,Twokinds,"Unfortunately, my brain wouldn't stop scripting comics while I'm trying to sleep."
21-11-2018T03:20:03,Twokinds,So now I'm here writing it out
21-11-2018T03:20:05,unsteddyphoenix,How rude!
21-11-2018T03:20:17,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, at least it saves time for later"
21-11-2018T03:23:20,unsteddyphoenix,What comic is the script for?
21-11-2018T03:23:52,Twokinds,...Twokinds
21-11-2018T03:24:13,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering: not sure I've read that comic of yours. is it good?
21-11-2018T03:24:57,unsteddyphoenix,"Damn, one of your side comics. Hoping it was Sam and Colin in the City"
21-11-2018T03:25:02,unsteddyphoenix,The main one
21-11-2018T03:25:15,Bgrmystr2,haha right
21-11-2018T03:26:59,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
21-11-2018T03:31:24,RimaDraws,i can't either
21-11-2018T03:31:27,RimaDraws,im playing catherine
21-11-2018T03:32:08,RimaDraws,fun puzzle horror game
21-11-2018T03:34:09,Twokinds,That's the one where... you climb things...?
21-11-2018T03:34:26,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I remember that one
21-11-2018T03:34:28,RimaDraws,Mhmmm it’s fun
21-11-2018T03:34:34,unsteddyphoenix,"Wanted to play it, but it was PS exclusive"
21-11-2018T03:34:41,Twokinds,I've honestly never seen much of that game. but I've heard of it.
21-11-2018T03:34:46,RimaDraws,I’ve beaten it twice
21-11-2018T03:37:48,unsteddyphoenix,"It seemed kinda cool, big anxiety metaphor, I think?"
21-11-2018T03:38:07,RimaDraws,I was playing Batman Arkham asylum. And yes but i love nightmare fuel
21-11-2018T03:38:54,Twokinds,I don't need to simulate anxiety I am already familiar
21-11-2018T03:39:14,RimaDraws,Well I’m into horror but not like that
21-11-2018T03:43:06,RimaDraws,So Tom working on the next page ?
21-11-2018T03:43:09,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, when anxiety is high I play bright, cartoony kinda games."
21-11-2018T03:43:30,TorqueEmUp,Nintendo seems like the best comfort games for me when I have bad anxiety.
21-11-2018T03:44:01,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
21-11-2018T03:44:11,unsteddyphoenix,"Still, it can be interesting from a different perspective"
21-11-2018T03:45:04,RimaDraws,My guilty pleasure is ff13
21-11-2018T03:46:18,TorqueEmUp,"Never played that one. I like hows it's hated, but for some reason they still released two sequels for 13."
21-11-2018T03:46:29,RimaDraws,I have them all
21-11-2018T03:46:41,RimaDraws,Beat the first installment three times
21-11-2018T03:46:43,TorqueEmUp,Somehow I think critics are louder than they should be on that. lol
21-11-2018T03:47:13,TorqueEmUp,"Though I have heard the joke for FF13, it's like food poisoning, it gets better after 24 hours."
21-11-2018T03:47:21,RimaDraws,Mhm
21-11-2018T03:48:12,Twokinds,Yes
21-11-2018T03:48:24,TorqueEmUp,Still to this day FFXV is so far the only Final Fantasy I've beat.
21-11-2018T03:48:55,RimaDraws,Never played don’t have a ps4 can’t afford one
21-11-2018T03:49:07,TorqueEmUp,Need to get around to the DLC though sometime.
21-11-2018T03:51:13,RimaDraws,It sounds fun
21-11-2018T03:52:03,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, the combat system really helped keep m e engaged, because it felt more like a action game with heavy JRPG elements."
21-11-2018T03:54:00,TorqueEmUp,"Plus the modern-ish world, but still magika driven world."
21-11-2018T03:54:03,RimaDraws,I’ll have to try it
21-11-2018T03:54:48,Twokinds,going to try and sleep again now.
21-11-2018T03:55:08,unsteddyphoenix,good luck~
21-11-2018T03:55:10,RimaDraws,Sleep well Tom!
21-11-2018T03:55:26,TorqueEmUp,Yeah I should probably do that too.
21-11-2018T03:55:32,TorqueEmUp,being 4am and all
21-11-2018T03:57:10,TorqueEmUp,"I'll have to pick up FF13 sometime, since it recently got a Xbox One X patch which lets you play it at 4k, instead of pitiful 720p. :P"
21-11-2018T03:57:48,TorqueEmUp,been meaning to pick it up before that patch too. lol
21-11-2018T03:58:24,RimaDraws,Mhm
21-11-2018T03:59:01,TorqueEmUp,"While before the PS3 version was the best way to play it, over the 360 version. Now the 360 version on Xbone X is. lol:P"
21-11-2018T03:59:37,RimaDraws,Yea sorry I’m poor
21-11-2018T04:14:18,RimaDraws,Well maybe late I can upgrade
21-11-2018T04:14:24,RimaDraws,Night all
21-11-2018T09:22:27,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-kingtea:
21-11-2018T09:23:07,iliar,"Good morning, Tom. How did you sleep?"
21-11-2018T09:24:12,Twokinds,Not well.
21-11-2018T09:24:12,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
21-11-2018T09:24:21,TerraTheWizard,oh no
21-11-2018T09:32:33,RimaDraws,Hey
21-11-2018T10:02:36,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s because we all didn’t say night nite
21-11-2018T10:15:42,Xexanoth,"nah it's because we're ""old"""
21-11-2018T10:20:55,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
21-11-2018T10:30:36,Dadrobit,"Oof, I actually maybe got too much sleep. Near 10 hours. Way too long. Headache city. Still need to make bread bowls for Thanksgiving party later... And I haven't yet been to the store for some of the ingredients..."
21-11-2018T10:32:19,Twokinds,lol
21-11-2018T10:32:34,Twokinds,ten hours seems pretty normal for me but I hate the loss of productive time
21-11-2018T10:32:59,Twokinds,Oh yeah Happy Thanksgiving
21-11-2018T10:33:02,Twokinds,For those who are doing anything
21-11-2018T10:33:06,Twokinds,I'm not.
21-11-2018T10:33:18,Dadrobit,"I usually only get around 6. Often less. I have a really terrible sleep ""schedule""."
21-11-2018T10:33:34,Dadrobit,"And yes, Happy Thanksgiving!"
21-11-2018T10:34:32,Twokinds,I managed to just get almost five
21-11-2018T10:34:38,Twokinds,So I think you took some of my hours
21-11-2018T10:35:22,Dadrobit,Grievest apologies.
21-11-2018T10:36:09,Xexanoth,how do you even sleep for 10 hours O.o
21-11-2018T10:40:36,TerraTheWizard,i did that yesterday
21-11-2018T10:40:45,TerraTheWizard,the trick is to be really tired :ctwokinds-wink:
21-11-2018T10:45:46,Dadrobit,"Did the math, probably closer to 11 actually"
21-11-2018T10:45:52,Dadrobit,Feelsbadman
21-11-2018T10:46:41,Dadrobit,I generally don't get enough sleep and just kinda operate on sheer force of will.
21-11-2018T10:47:00,Dadrobit,This was my body catching up on me I suppose.
21-11-2018T10:50:32,iliar,How to sleep 10 hours? It is easy. Just sleep. The main problem: the day is only 24 hours.
21-11-2018T11:04:51,Dadrobit,"Alright, heading out to the store(s?) to see if I can't get the rest of my foodstuffs for later."
21-11-2018T11:05:02,Dadrobit,Have a good one y'all!
21-11-2018T11:05:03,Twokinds,Good luck
21-11-2018T11:05:14,Twokinds,"Be sure to ask the Casher ""What are you doing working here today?!"""
21-11-2018T11:06:20,Dadrobit,Oh God screw that. I worked as a till operator extrodinare for many years. I only sympathise with them on the deepest of levels. I'll just buy them a beer instead.
21-11-2018T11:07:21,Dadrobit,"True fact: my resume actually has that instead of ""cashier"" for my work history."
21-11-2018T11:07:50,Twokinds,lol
21-11-2018T11:08:00,Twokinds,That's a good way to put it

21-11-2018T12:06:24,Xexanoth,yay floof dragon

21-11-2018T12:09:35,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:
21-11-2018T12:17:53,Twokinds,It's so cold
21-11-2018T12:18:36,Twokinds,"There's a cold snap blowing through, and my mother seems to have figured this is the perfect time to turn off the heat, open all the doors and windows and air out the house. Then she just leaves."
21-11-2018T12:18:44,Twokinds,Why do this to me!
21-11-2018T12:19:00,Twokinds,So I ran around closing everything again and turn the heat back on. X_x
21-11-2018T12:20:56,Mippy,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA: WTF! Momiplier (?)
21-11-2018T12:22:28,TerraTheWizard,chilly
21-11-2018T12:22:49,iliar,Natani unlucky as usual. Dragons are not mammals. They do not have breasts. But Natani even in dragon form have boobs.
21-11-2018T12:23:23,Twokinds,Only becomes the chat demanded it XD
21-11-2018T12:23:47,TerraTheWizard,"'tis natani's curse, can never escape the 'bwom'"
21-11-2018T12:26:31,iliar,"About home heating. I wonder how warm at home it is usually. I heard in Japan in houses it is usually cold, because heating is very expensive."
21-11-2018T12:27:01,Mippy,Damm you chat! *shakes fist like an angry old man*
21-11-2018T12:30:11,Twokinds,My house is maintained at 20C
21-11-2018T12:30:44,iliar,Wow. It's cold.
21-11-2018T12:32:53,iliar,You do not like when the house is hot? Or is there some other reason?
21-11-2018T12:33:50,Twokinds,It's not cold. It's... pretty reasonable
21-11-2018T12:34:00,Twokinds,Any more and it'd be too hot.
21-11-2018T12:35:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe your mother was trying to freeze you out of bed
21-11-2018T12:37:53,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, my thermostat is set at 20C too"
21-11-2018T12:38:28,TorqueEmUp,69F specifically since we use that here. :p
21-11-2018T12:39:45,TorqueEmUp,"I can't stand when people crank the heat, especially when riding in a car. X_X"
21-11-2018T12:40:17,iliar,"I like it when the house is about 25°C (77°F). The standards is said this is optimal for sitting work. 20°C (68°F) is optimal for physical work (for example, if you exercise)"
21-11-2018T12:43:39,Mippy,We have to have ours prett high in the winter to compete with how cold it gets outside. We still wear socks to bed either way.
21-11-2018T12:44:13,TorqueEmUp,"I always do that anyway, regardless of season. lol"
21-11-2018T12:44:24,TorqueEmUp,Wearing socks to bed
21-11-2018T12:45:59,Mippy,I never realized how great thick wool socks are until I moved cross country
21-11-2018T12:53:27,iliar,Funny. Russia is considered a cold country. But in winter I have a problem that the house is too hot.
21-11-2018T12:54:54,Twokinds,Well if you're keeping it at 77 I would think so!
21-11-2018T12:55:00,Twokinds,77 would be too hot for me.
21-11-2018T12:57:14,iliar,"No, I like 77°F. But sometimes the temperature in my room than 30°C (86°F). It's too warm even for me."
21-11-2018T12:57:44,iliar,* more then
21-11-2018T14:10:01,Combak,Iliar is Russian?
21-11-2018T14:12:26,iliar,Yes
21-11-2018T14:12:45,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-KeithNeat:
21-11-2018T14:12:58,Combak,^
21-11-2018T14:17:56,iliar,And that's reason why my English so bad.
21-11-2018T14:36:11,Combak,"Nah, you're pretty good."
21-11-2018T14:42:58,MrMongMong,Did I just miss the stream?
21-11-2018T14:43:39,TorqueEmUp,no
21-11-2018T14:43:46,MrMongMong,oh.
21-11-2018T14:43:52,MrMongMong,Is it just a chat now then?
21-11-2018T14:44:19,TorqueEmUp,There are always lurkers chatting here. :P
21-11-2018T14:44:35,Twokinds,Yeah what a bunch of weirdos!

21-11-2018T16:33:00,Dadrobit,Got about a dozen kids running around around me though that are all sub 10 years old though. That's less than ideal.
21-11-2018T16:33:30,Bgrmystr2,I would have just noped in my room the whole time
21-11-2018T16:33:44,Bgrmystr2,especially how early it is for you right now for my clock
21-11-2018T16:35:18,Dadrobit,S'what I'm kinda doing in the back art room right now. Only 2:30. Gonna let the kids tire themselves out for a bit before returning.

21-11-2018T18:17:12,Mippy,I’d also send Tom stuff...but then I’d have to convince him to give me his mailing address
21-11-2018T18:17:44,RimaDraws,That’s true but I’d just send it to be nice so he can have a treat
21-11-2018T18:17:47,unsteddyphoenix,Rub it in why dont you~
21-11-2018T18:18:02,unsteddyphoenix,Im very UNTHANKFUL

21-11-2018T18:20:51,unsteddyphoenix,I saw that! Nice art Rima~
21-11-2018T18:21:05,Mippy,My fan art done by hand is decent but I’m not as confident with my digital stuff. Needs practice.
21-11-2018T18:21:06,unsteddyphoenix,Mines still Nibbly riding happy crab tho

21-11-2018T18:22:17,Mippy,My wallpaper is that old sexy Alaric coloured piece
21-11-2018T18:22:26,Dadrobit,Screw that. The hype train has no brakes
21-11-2018T18:22:52,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floAAA:
21-11-2018T18:24:00,unsteddyphoenix,Im getting mixed reviews
21-11-2018T18:24:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Here’s your 🦃
21-11-2018T18:24:42,Twokinds,Have you seen those like... can shaped cranberries? Do they have that where you are?
21-11-2018T18:24:50,TerraTheWizard,so do you muricans have a roast dinner on xmas day too? or does thanksgiving take the roast day slot
21-11-2018T18:24:58,Twokinds,It's totally a thing.
21-11-2018T18:24:59,Dadrobit,CHOOO CHOOO
21-11-2018T18:25:21,unsteddyphoenix,can shaped...what does that mean?
21-11-2018T18:25:23,Mippy,"Oh, like cranberry jelly in a can? We have those for every holiday meal."
21-11-2018T18:25:54,Dadrobit,We currently have both canned and fresh on the table
21-11-2018T18:26:02,SpazztasticKiwi,So the line for the about 12 spiderman themed PlayStations....
21-11-2018T18:26:13,unsteddyphoenix,Because some people like canned more? :thinking:
21-11-2018T18:26:14,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s gonna be tears
21-11-2018T18:26:54,Dadrobit,Like young children that don't really care where their cranberries come from.
21-11-2018T18:27:16,unsteddyphoenix,"Ahhh pawn them off on the kids, I LIKE that."
21-11-2018T18:27:58,Mippy,My mom dose not like the texture of whole cranberries...so we go with the jelly. :shrug:
21-11-2018T18:28:49,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao
21-11-2018T18:28:54,Dadrobit,Honestly it's still really good.

21-11-2018T18:29:22,Twokinds,Literally canned-shaped
21-11-2018T18:29:25,Mippy,"Definitely, really easy to make leftover sandwiches with"
21-11-2018T18:29:38,Twokinds,That's actually how it's served.
21-11-2018T18:29:45,Twokinds,"At least, in my experience."
21-11-2018T18:29:49,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha what the hell
21-11-2018T18:29:55,Dadrobit,"Speaking of, grandaddy is giving me mean looks for having my phone out."
21-11-2018T18:30:02,unsteddyphoenix,I LOVE this picture

21-11-2018T18:30:26,Mippy,Yup! That’s a familiar sight. We actually cut ours into round disk
21-11-2018T18:30:29,TerraTheWizard,"but yeah, that's weird"
21-11-2018T18:30:30,Mippy,S
21-11-2018T18:30:36,unsteddyphoenix,"Such a high quality, framed shot...centered on just this blob"
21-11-2018T18:30:40,Twokinds,XD
21-11-2018T18:30:48,Twokinds,That's what it's supposed to look like on the table!
21-11-2018T18:30:52,RimaDraws,Tom what’s your fav dessert
21-11-2018T18:30:54,Twokinds,Then you slice it
21-11-2018T18:31:05,RimaDraws,Oh the cranberry sauce?
21-11-2018T18:31:21,unsteddyphoenix,"Why...cant you just, mush it into a bowl."
21-11-2018T18:31:29,Mippy,It’s bizarre but yummy.
21-11-2018T18:31:31,unsteddyphoenix,"I wouldnt want to be reminded it came from a can, personally"
21-11-2018T18:31:32,Twokinds,I always did find it kind of ridiculous
21-11-2018T18:31:39,Dadrobit,"Yeah, we serve it sliced in circles as well. And another that's mashed intoa padte."
21-11-2018T18:31:47,RimaDraws,I don’t eat cranberry sauce
21-11-2018T18:31:52,Dadrobit,Into a paste
21-11-2018T18:32:20,Mippy,Yummy stuff.
21-11-2018T18:32:28,RimaDraws,I learned how to make a new dessert from my cousins wife
21-11-2018T18:32:31,unsteddyphoenix,If you say so~
21-11-2018T18:32:42,Dadrobit,"Okay, back to the party. I'm getting snarky remarks."
21-11-2018T18:32:49,Twokinds,"If I was a cranberry canner, I would at least intent the can with like, thanksgiving shapes or something. But I guess that would be way more expensive than just a standard can."
21-11-2018T18:32:50,unsteddyphoenix,Tell them I said hi!
21-11-2018T18:33:11,unsteddyphoenix,What's a thanksgiving shape :thinking:

21-11-2018T18:35:37,SpazztasticKiwi,You know they make cranberry sauce molds
21-11-2018T18:35:40,RimaDraws,Beautiful displays

21-11-2018T18:40:48,Mippy,We just pin dangerous fake flowers to our chests

21-11-2018T18:46:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom you’re suspiciously excited about opium
21-11-2018T18:47:10,Mippy,The tradition is connected to Lieutenant-Colonel John McCrae‘s poem “Flanders Fields” that he wrote on the battle field.
21-11-2018T18:47:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m sitting for two seconds at home and Bagheera jumps in the lap

21-11-2018T18:48:41,TerraTheWizard,but as a brit i know squat about thanksgiving
21-11-2018T18:49:22,TerraTheWizard,and i still find it weird that most places stay open xmas day in the US

21-11-2018T19:13:27,unsteddyphoenix,It's because they came from a BOX
21-11-2018T19:16:06,Dadrobit,:( moved a couch to sweep/mop and found one of Nyx's old toy mice...

21-11-2018T19:17:38,SpazztasticKiwi,That is the cutest mouse emoji
21-11-2018T19:17:39,Dadrobit,But I do fondly-ish recall one.time she caught a mouse and woke me up on the couch by dropping it on my chest.
21-11-2018T19:18:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"“Here. Dinner. This is that ‘steak’ stuff, right?”"
21-11-2018T19:18:33,SpazztasticKiwi,My sisters cat once woke the whole house up chasing a mouse
21-11-2018T19:18:38,Dadrobit,Was a less than ideal way to wake up with 3/4th of a mouse on me.
21-11-2018T19:18:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"Once were were all in the living room, she dropped it on my foot"
21-11-2018T19:18:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Still alive

21-11-2018T19:20:01,unsteddyphoenix,Dad it didn't even happen to me but I'm so sad about that
21-11-2018T19:20:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Now. Kiwi. She’s a similar story. She likes to eat half the mouse (the brains) and the leaves the rest usually in the hall
21-11-2018T19:20:30,SpazztasticKiwi,And then later pukes the brains up
21-11-2018T19:20:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Guts don’t bug me anymore
21-11-2018T19:21:18,Dadrobit,"Yeah, kinda blows a hard one. Brother has her sister at his girlfriend's house so he sends me pictures of her every once in a blue moon."

21-11-2018T19:23:32,SpazztasticKiwi,No the message about the brothers sister at his girlfriends house
21-11-2018T19:23:34,Dadrobit,Nyx passed away two-ish months ago.

21-11-2018T19:25:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Candy got real sick after her 3rd birthday and died
21-11-2018T19:27:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"Mom thought she’d be ok as an indoor/outdoor. And she was for a small while. But then she went missing, and when she did return, she was starving and had a bite on her ear"

21-11-2018T19:44:15,SpazztasticKiwi,He knows how to sit in a hoodie

21-11-2018T19:53:09,RimaDraws,I hit mine after dinner too dadro
21-11-2018T19:53:45,Dadrobit,I'll probably be up for a while. Got damn near 11 hours last night.
21-11-2018T19:53:58,RimaDraws,Same I need to get some art done
21-11-2018T19:54:55,Dadrobit,"(Also, that cowboy hat really doesn't jive all that well with the house's aesthetics)"
21-11-2018T19:56:18,RimaDraws,Lol
21-11-2018T19:57:49,unsteddyphoenix,That is a knick knacks heavy house
21-11-2018T19:58:35,Dadrobit,Most all of it is native American art stuff grandma has collected/created
21-11-2018T19:58:49,Dadrobit,The hat is my brother in law's
21-11-2018T20:02:33,unsteddyphoenix,"You live in the wild west, the hat is always appropriate"
21-11-2018T20:02:59,Dadrobit,The guy is about 72% actual cowboy.
21-11-2018T20:03:33,Dadrobit,Rides and takes care of folks horses and all that.
21-11-2018T20:08:18,SpazztasticKiwi,And what about 28%...
21-11-2018T20:08:36,unsteddyphoenix,Is there enough room in that town for the both of you?
21-11-2018T20:09:36,Dadrobit,The other 28%? Alcohol usually.
21-11-2018T20:10:55,Dadrobit,Also his main job is a director at a manufacturing plant that makes vehicles for disabled people.
21-11-2018T20:12:24,Dadrobit,Walks the manufacturing floors in his cowboy hat with a Single Action Army on his hip.
21-11-2018T20:12:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn’t realize I was so hungry until I stuffed this sandwich in my mouth
21-11-2018T20:13:18,unsteddyphoenix,Does he tip his hat at all?
21-11-2018T20:13:37,Dadrobit,Of course.
21-11-2018T20:14:30,Dadrobit,"I'm not so confident to walk around like I'm out of Red Dead, but he's been doing it for as long as I've known him."
21-11-2018T20:14:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, with Christmas coming, I remember the Judgement House will be open soon"
21-11-2018T20:15:16,Mippy,"Well, that was fun while it lasted...Photoshop decided it was a good idea to crash"
21-11-2018T20:15:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"“Not today, Mate”"
21-11-2018T20:57:19,SpazztasticKiwi,🍌🌰🍞
21-11-2018T21:00:34,RimaDraws,Well I’m not sure what to do right now. Work on art or cosplays
21-11-2018T21:03:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m tempted to try arting
21-11-2018T21:03:07,SpazztasticKiwi,But it’s so far away
21-11-2018T21:03:33,SpazztasticKiwi,And I have a cat on me
21-11-2018T21:05:03,unsteddyphoenix,The cat must not be disturbed
21-11-2018T21:10:34,RimaDraws,i want to do both
21-11-2018T21:14:25,Mippy,"I tried arting but the universe dose not want me to digital. I can’t traditional because my desk, which is actually our kitchen table, is being used"
21-11-2018T21:16:35,RimaDraws,awwww ;;
21-11-2018T21:18:11,Mippy,"Oh well, gonna go see some kimono just as soon as my friend gets here"
21-11-2018T21:45:33,SpazztasticKiwi,:ctwokinds-sleepoverA:
21-11-2018T21:47:50,Dadrobit,Aaaaand I'm back at home.
21-11-2018T21:47:54,Dadrobit,Nice and quiet
21-11-2018T21:48:34,unsteddyphoenix,Welcome home daddy~
21-11-2018T21:48:52,RimaDraws,wb
21-11-2018T21:54:24,SpazztasticKiwi,🐈 💤
21-11-2018T21:56:55,RimaDraws,im gonna stream a bit i think
21-11-2018T23:05:17,SpazztasticKiwi,How many times. In a horror movie. Do we have to shoot the thing before “bullets don’t work” finally hit you
21-11-2018T23:20:21,RimaDraws,lol
21-11-2018T23:35:42,Dadrobit,Use bigger bullets
21-11-2018T23:39:45,RimaDraws,i just lost the entire art i was working on
21-11-2018T23:40:23,Dadrobit,Ctrl+S
21-11-2018T23:40:29,RimaDraws,yea well guess what
21-11-2018T23:40:36,Dadrobit,You didn't?
21-11-2018T23:40:36,RimaDraws,i was almost finished and the program crashed
21-11-2018T23:40:42,RimaDraws,so no i didnt
21-11-2018T23:41:04,Dadrobit,No autosave function whatsoever?
21-11-2018T23:41:13,RimaDraws,not on sai2
21-11-2018T23:42:52,Dadrobit,That's very sad...
21-11-2018T23:43:18,Dadrobit,And a bit outdated tbh. Lotsa programs have configurable autosaves nowadays.
21-11-2018T23:43:44,Dadrobit,Is there an add-on you can download for that program to help prevent it?
21-11-2018T23:43:59,RimaDraws,this is a fairly new version of sai
21-11-2018T23:44:03,RimaDraws,so no its not outdated
21-11-2018T23:44:26,RimaDraws,and no im not tech savvy nor do i have the patience
21-11-2018T23:44:41,Dadrobit,Just saying the practice of having your program not offer the user the option of an autosave is outdated.
21-11-2018T23:44:56,Dadrobit,From the developers pov
21-11-2018T23:45:15,RimaDraws,i normally save but that was my fault
21-11-2018T23:45:17,RimaDraws,not the program
21-11-2018T23:46:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m so paranoid about my everything I have auto save set for every five seconds
21-11-2018T23:46:01,Dadrobit,"Weeeeeeeellllll. The program did crash, so not 100% your fault lol."
21-11-2018T23:46:18,Bgrmystr2,the fact that the program doesn't have an auto-save isn't your fault either.
21-11-2018T23:46:20,RimaDraws,still partially my fault i didn't save...
21-11-2018T23:46:22,Bgrmystr2,cuz it should have it.
21-11-2018T23:46:25,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah its still mostly the programs fault
21-11-2018T23:46:30,unsteddyphoenix,But that is unlucky :(
21-11-2018T23:48:04,Dadrobit,I actively get the jitters whenever I realized I haven't made a save in a few minutes.
21-11-2018T23:48:30,Dadrobit,"just ""fuckfuckfuckfuck"" and mash the save hotkeys repeatedly."
21-11-2018T23:49:24,unsteddyphoenix,Thats a good paranoia habit to have
21-11-2018T23:49:31,unsteddyphoenix,I should try teach myself that
21-11-2018T23:50:12,Dadrobit,"Yeah, and that's on top of ProTools having autosave functioning every 10 minutes. Losing work sucks balls."
21-11-2018T23:50:17,RimaDraws,im so mad that i didn't save...
21-11-2018T23:50:42,Dadrobit,I'm mad for and with you.
21-11-2018T23:51:28,RimaDraws,oh well back to square one....
21-11-2018T23:51:32,RimaDraws,;;
21-11-2018T23:52:09,unsteddyphoenix,We're mad in solidarity together
21-11-2018T23:53:59,RimaDraws,god too bad i didn't bring leftovers home i can use the fuel now
21-11-2018T23:54:12,Dadrobit,commission?
21-11-2018T23:54:25,RimaDraws,i have a few commissions to finish and i have no energy
21-11-2018T23:54:53,unsteddyphoenix,There's noting quite as de-motivational as losing work
21-11-2018T23:54:58,Dadrobit,"The one you lost was a commission? Screw just regular mad, I'd be turbo-furious."
21-11-2018T23:55:06,RimaDraws,no its a patreon post...
21-11-2018T23:55:11,RimaDraws,its paid yes and nsfw...
21-11-2018T23:55:32,Dadrobit,"Mmmmm, still a loss."
21-11-2018T23:55:41,RimaDraws,yea it is
