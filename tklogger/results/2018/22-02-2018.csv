22-02-2018T21:18:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Unsteddy's jimmies are rustled
22-02-2018T21:19:03,grosskev,greetings all
22-02-2018T21:19:05,McClaw,"I try, @NezumiYuki"
22-02-2018T21:19:09,Sammit,Hi Kev
22-02-2018T21:19:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Kev
22-02-2018T21:20:09,TheAngelsPlace,It’s been a long time hasn’t it
22-02-2018T21:20:33,Sammit,Hi AngelsPlace
22-02-2018T21:20:41,TheAngelsPlace,Hey
22-02-2018T21:21:41,BluePhantom90,huh e-e Watched that Video your brother posted Tom. About that shooting. Annoyingly he kept calling the Ar-15 a Assault Rifle.
22-02-2018T21:21:54,Combak,It isn't?
22-02-2018T21:22:12,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"they can be, but not always. like circles and ellipses"
22-02-2018T21:22:49,SageSaga,it really bothers me when people use the wrong word for something! I get so triggered I cant ignore it and focus on the issue! Oh wait- i can do that
22-02-2018T21:22:54,BluePhantom90,Ar-15's are semi-auto when sold to civilians
22-02-2018T21:23:09,ZRO4825,"Hey, Sage. Racing has physics. :P"
22-02-2018T21:23:17,Combak,... And that changes them into something other than an assault rifle?
22-02-2018T21:23:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,most rifles sold are semi auto
22-02-2018T21:23:47,ItsActuallyKopyKat,^^
22-02-2018T21:23:47,BluePhantom90,"Assault Rifles are full-auto, or 3 round burst fire"
22-02-2018T21:23:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,like the ruger mini 30
22-02-2018T21:23:47,unsteddyphoenix,It can change how legal  they are
22-02-2018T21:23:51,Ordithus,They certainly aren't typical for a hunting rifle
22-02-2018T21:23:59,SageSaga,*Pushes up glasses* Technically an assault rifle is an automatic rifle - hyuk hyuk hyuk
22-02-2018T21:24:25,NezumiYuki,To the Anti-Gun lobby... an Assault Rifle is anything that has a magazine capacity over 5 rounds...   pffffffff
22-02-2018T21:24:26,Combak,So then what is it!?
22-02-2018T21:24:29,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"""Kids... could ya lighten up a little?"""
22-02-2018T21:24:34,McClaw,"""Assault rifle"" has a specific military defintion. ""Assault weapon"" doesn't."
22-02-2018T21:25:04,Ordithus,Yay semantics
22-02-2018T21:25:17,McClaw,The civilian AR-15 is /not/ an assault rifle.
22-02-2018T21:25:17,Sammit,is strange some people get mad because of the use of a gun against civilians other get mad because the use of an improper term for the gun
22-02-2018T21:25:18,SageSaga,lets all just agree if there were no guns there would be no gun violence- if you cant agree with that i dont know whats wrong with you
22-02-2018T21:25:44,ItsActuallyKopyKat,^^
22-02-2018T21:25:47,ZRO4825,That much I can agree with. We'd still all be stabbing each other with swords or shooting each other with bows and crossbows instead.
22-02-2018T21:25:48,BluePhantom90,"And the ""AR"" in Ar-15 stands for ""Armalite-15"""
22-02-2018T21:25:50,Twokinds,My headphones broke
22-02-2018T21:25:52,TorqueEmUp,"I can agree to that, but there will always be guns out there. :P"
22-02-2018T21:25:53,Twokinds,So no bounce today
22-02-2018T21:25:56,Combak,Oh no!
22-02-2018T21:25:59,Bgrmystr2,aww tom :(
22-02-2018T21:25:59,McClaw,"The problem with that viewpoint, SageSaga, is it wouldn't eliminate the violence, only what was being used."
22-02-2018T21:26:00,unsteddyphoenix,The saddest news
22-02-2018T21:26:02,Twokinds,300364
22-02-2018T21:26:07,Bgrmystr2,RIP Bounce
22-02-2018T21:26:09,NezumiYuki,Now you gusy dun did it... You drew me into POLITICS... I dunt like politics... Okay guys as a favor to Tom... Let's make the chat room a Politics Free Zone
22-02-2018T21:26:09,InTheLionsDen,:ctwokinds-florajiggle:
22-02-2018T21:26:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-LauraCry: but the bouncy
22-02-2018T21:26:16,Twokinds,Boobie
22-02-2018T21:26:20,unsteddyphoenix,No speakers to blast audio from?
22-02-2018T21:26:24,SageSaga,there is no problem with that view point - its a fact not a suggestion
22-02-2018T21:26:26,ZRO4825,HURRAY FOR BOOBIES!! \[T]/
22-02-2018T21:26:27,Ordithus,haha Tom
22-02-2018T21:26:32,TorqueEmUp,Tom censored himself
22-02-2018T21:26:34,TorqueEmUp,:P
22-02-2018T21:26:43,Nekonny,\o/
22-02-2018T21:26:43,Ordithus,twice even
22-02-2018T21:26:45,unsteddyphoenix,"Wait ""8008135"" is boobies"
22-02-2018T21:26:50,SageSaga,im not saying its the solution you just have idiots who think every anti-gun person is for the destruction of all guns
22-02-2018T21:26:51,unsteddyphoenix,Did you use 3
22-02-2018T21:26:52,Combak,But there'll be the recording.... for a while.
22-02-2018T21:26:54,unsteddyphoenix,Thast insane
22-02-2018T21:27:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,everyone memorize that number
22-02-2018T21:27:11,ZRO4825,Boobies can never be truly censored. They are always out there. Always waiting. Always bouncing...somewhere.
22-02-2018T21:27:24,unsteddyphoenix,They cant take my rubber band gun :ctwokinds-flomad:
22-02-2018T21:27:26,ItsActuallyKopyKat,even in natani's pocket dimension
22-02-2018T21:27:30,SageSaga,people who are so pro gun they cant accept the idea of a world without guns are not seeing the statement- its a way to test people
22-02-2018T21:27:51,BluePhantom90,"You know sage they say we should be like other countries. Worked for them in France, and Australia."
22-02-2018T21:27:58,SageSaga,"if someone says ""Thats not right! even if you got rid of guns there would still be gun violence!"" its proof they arent listening"
22-02-2018T21:28:05,TorqueEmUp,"Being a gun owner myself, it is too easy to get anything semi-auto."
22-02-2018T21:28:09,McClaw,"I can imagine a world without guns, but I think that would be a pretty horrible world."
22-02-2018T21:28:14,Bgrmystr2,GL getting rid of guns though
22-02-2018T21:28:20,ZRO4825,I can imagine it. But it's a pipe dream at best in this day and age.
22-02-2018T21:28:23,NezumiYuki,Natani's chest wrap will someday find out that containing the AMPLE is nye to impossible.. and will break open someday under the strain!  XD
22-02-2018T21:28:26,Bgrmystr2,"unless you got a magical ""Poof"" power"
22-02-2018T21:28:29,Nekonny,"its ""because you cant keep guns out of the hands of criminals"""
22-02-2018T21:28:34,Nekonny,is thir main argument
22-02-2018T21:28:42,McClaw,"Usually that ""fact"" is trotted out as if it were a solution to something, but it isn't."
22-02-2018T21:28:43,funnyman42,"Hey guys, I miss anything?"
22-02-2018T21:28:44,Ordithus,Give the criminals squirt guns
22-02-2018T21:28:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"@TorqueEmUp anything semi auto, like almost all hand guns, and rifles"
22-02-2018T21:28:55,Nekonny,no firearms in japan
22-02-2018T21:28:57,TorqueEmUp,A kid is always going to be able to grab daddy's gun.
22-02-2018T21:28:59,CrRAR,works in europe too XD
22-02-2018T21:29:16,Nekonny,"and a lot of other conties that have n =o weapons, even if criminals do have guns"
22-02-2018T21:29:21,NezumiYuki,Torque... that... came out sounding so wrong... just saying
22-02-2018T21:29:25,SageSaga,its not about getting rid of guns- its about proving that progun lobbyist are so far up their own bums to even consider the idea of talking about doing something to stop rampant gun violence
22-02-2018T21:29:29,TorqueEmUp,"Even if you outright ban all guns, there will still be millions of guns stashed away in people's homes."
22-02-2018T21:29:30,BluePhantom90,I don't think everyone heard that China had people stabbed over a 130 people and killed 33. no ban on knifes there
22-02-2018T21:29:32,Nekonny,the amount of gun violence goes down sharply
22-02-2018T21:29:43,CrRAR,yup yup
22-02-2018T21:29:51,McClaw,"So are the most vocal anti-gun lobbiest, SageSaga."
22-02-2018T21:29:57,SageSaga,yep
22-02-2018T21:30:02,SageSaga,idiots on both sides
22-02-2018T21:30:04,Nekonny,sure as heck aint arming teachers
22-02-2018T21:30:19,ZRO4825,"Um..actually, Nekonny, some places are."
22-02-2018T21:30:24,Nekonny,no teacher I know wants to be carrying a gun around school
22-02-2018T21:30:28,CrRAR,^^
22-02-2018T21:30:35,SageSaga,but the NRA is a tiny group with way too much money
22-02-2018T21:30:43,SageSaga,and way too much power
22-02-2018T21:30:44,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"they're not that small, actually"
22-02-2018T21:30:49,SageSaga,yeah they are
22-02-2018T21:30:51,Ordithus,"lots of kids in close proximity to incredibly dangerous objects, yeesh"
22-02-2018T21:30:51,McClaw,So are the most vitrolic anti-gun lobbies.
22-02-2018T21:31:01,SageSaga,clearly not McClaw
22-02-2018T21:31:06,Twokinds,brb
22-02-2018T21:31:16,146Time,Are you kidding? do you know how much money the clintons have?
22-02-2018T21:31:24,ItsActuallyKopyKat,^^
22-02-2018T21:31:27,Ordithus,Who cares?
22-02-2018T21:31:29,LannAF,howdy!
22-02-2018T21:31:32,CrRAR,"Yeah they're basically goading the american people into a solution that ""Guns are safe, see just everyone buy a gun and we'll all be EXTRA SAFE!"""
22-02-2018T21:31:35,ItsActuallyKopyKat,hiya!
22-02-2018T21:31:38,McClaw,Let's talk Kendrians. :P
22-02-2018T21:31:43,CrRAR,SUPER SAFE
22-02-2018T21:31:46,Ordithus,"Keidrans, McClaw!"
22-02-2018T21:31:56,Zakuru,69 users
22-02-2018T21:31:57,McClaw,I can never get that right.
22-02-2018T21:31:59,BluePhantom90,Um Sage if they were willing to do anything. Why didn't anything change since Colombian? Or Virginia Tech. Those shootings happen when a assault weapons ban was in place back in 1993
22-02-2018T21:32:02,ZRO4825,NRA membership passed the 5 million mark in 2013.
22-02-2018T21:32:10,SageSaga,Because of the NRA
22-02-2018T21:32:10,NezumiYuki,And let's also talk about Basitin Black Magic!
22-02-2018T21:32:31,CrRAR,"yup, frikken ridiculous"
22-02-2018T21:32:36,Bgrmystr2,"lol Cr, it makes sense by way of prevention"
22-02-2018T21:32:38,SageSaga,our first step should be allowing groups to study gun violence- but the CDC is banned from doing that
22-02-2018T21:32:38,McClaw,"There aren't any guns in the comic, are there? No gun talk in the stream! :P"
22-02-2018T21:32:40,unsteddyphoenix,language! &gt;:(
22-02-2018T21:32:41,SageSaga,thanks to the NRA
22-02-2018T21:32:47,Zakuru,"hm, one would think politics wouldn't be allowed in chat"
22-02-2018T21:32:53,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"McClaw, Exactly!"
22-02-2018T21:32:53,SageSaga,there are guns in the comic
22-02-2018T21:33:04,McClaw,"The CDC is the wrong group to be doing that kind of study, SageSaga."
22-02-2018T21:33:11,unsteddyphoenix,Its only allowed if sage is into it

22-02-2018T21:33:22,Bgrmystr2,xD What phoenix said.
22-02-2018T21:33:23,Zakuru,*shrugs*
22-02-2018T21:33:25,unsteddyphoenix,"Not that I particularly like the ""no politics"" rule anyway."
22-02-2018T21:33:36,Ordithus,It's mostly to keep things civil
22-02-2018T21:33:37,unsteddyphoenix,Oh noo people might get upset~
22-02-2018T21:33:39,unsteddyphoenix,Ban them then
22-02-2018T21:33:42,BluePhantom90,huh okay I will admit I am sorry for starting this on guns. I would like to finish it.
22-02-2018T21:33:43,neropan,woa
22-02-2018T21:33:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Nero baby
22-02-2018T21:33:53,Sammit,Hi Nero
22-02-2018T21:34:01,SageSaga,oh right the people who study ways to prevent people from dying has no business studying how people die
22-02-2018T21:34:06,unsteddyphoenix,Yo Nero
22-02-2018T21:34:22,McClaw,"Disease vs non-disease, Sage."
22-02-2018T21:34:23,ItsActuallyKopyKat,but it's the center for disease control... not gun control
22-02-2018T21:34:23,146Time,"No, they're people who study contagions. That instantly labels gun ownership a disease"
22-02-2018T21:34:24,NezumiYuki,Ok yall... We gonna have to ask you to check yoru guns at the gate... Dodge won't let you in if your packing... Gotta problem with that.. Take it up with Wild Bill Lady Nora!
22-02-2018T21:34:31,146Time,it's a loaded context
22-02-2018T21:34:42,146Time,"you don't have the CDC studying car crash statistics, do you?"
22-02-2018T21:34:44,BluePhantom90,No more gun talk guys. I started it and I want to end it
22-02-2018T21:34:52,Bgrmystr2,"It doesn't work that way, Blue"
22-02-2018T21:34:54,LannAF,"okay, here for real"
22-02-2018T21:34:55,McClaw,Fluffy tails.
22-02-2018T21:35:00,LannAF,Hiya! What's up?
22-02-2018T21:35:02,McClaw,Lick-kisse.
22-02-2018T21:35:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Lann
22-02-2018T21:35:08,Bgrmystr2,hey Lann
22-02-2018T21:35:10,McClaw,(Lick-kisses.)
22-02-2018T21:35:12,Nekonny,You need a licene to drive a car
22-02-2018T21:35:13,LannAF,"hi Marv, hi Bgr"
22-02-2018T21:35:20,Nekonny,that can get suspended if you are unfit
22-02-2018T21:35:27,Sammit,Hi Lann
22-02-2018T21:35:30,146Time,You need a licence to concealed carry
22-02-2018T21:35:35,LannAF,howdy sammit
22-02-2018T21:35:40,146Time,You don't need a licence to *own* a car though
22-02-2018T21:35:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,only if you get caught Ron
22-02-2018T21:35:48,ZRO4825,I see people driving all the time on suspended licenses.
22-02-2018T21:35:49,Nekonny,but you cant own a tank
22-02-2018T21:35:49,TorqueEmUp,Yeah but a license isn't going to stop drunks from driving.
22-02-2018T21:35:53,SageSaga,the CDC researches car related deaths
22-02-2018T21:35:59,146Time,And you can't own a rocket launcher either
22-02-2018T21:36:02,NezumiYuki,"Okay guys, as a change of subject matter....  Wet Kat or Wet Natani?   Discuss nao!  :D"
22-02-2018T21:36:03,BluePhantom90,You can own a tank
22-02-2018T21:36:09,unsteddyphoenix,Wait does that mean you can get a gun without a licence in america?
22-02-2018T21:36:14,FoxxTrotter,Meh...POLITICS. XP
22-02-2018T21:36:15,ZRO4825,@NezumiYuki Yes.
22-02-2018T21:36:16,Ordithus,"Yes, steddy"
22-02-2018T21:36:20,Nekonny,staps talking about it
22-02-2018T21:36:26,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah you can own a tank, just has to be disarmed"
22-02-2018T21:36:30,Bgrmystr2,Agree w/ zro
22-02-2018T21:36:34,unsteddyphoenix,"Huh. Not an AR at least though, right?"
22-02-2018T21:36:35,Ordithus,Why not both Yuki?
22-02-2018T21:36:38,Twokinds,Of course
22-02-2018T21:36:38,SageSaga,sorry- im just sick of people hand waving kids getting murdered
22-02-2018T21:36:46,Ordithus,^
22-02-2018T21:36:49,NezumiYuki,I like the way you think Ord!
22-02-2018T21:36:50,ZRO4825,"@unsteddy Yes, you can. I own two myself."
22-02-2018T21:37:06,Ordithus,"Personally, I'm more interested in cars and archery :)"
22-02-2018T21:37:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I got one too
22-02-2018T21:37:11,unsteddyphoenix,Oh. Huh.
22-02-2018T21:37:12,neropan,:ptv-confused:
22-02-2018T21:37:21,ZRO4825,I have an idea.
22-02-2018T21:37:25,ZRO4825,Everyone tackle Neropan with hugs.
22-02-2018T21:37:26,unsteddyphoenix,Unsure how I feel about that lol.
22-02-2018T21:37:39,unsteddyphoenix,Nero bby~
22-02-2018T21:37:42,Zakuru,hugs nero
22-02-2018T21:37:47,Twokinds,There's so many guns. You can never have bought a gun and still end up having one. XD
22-02-2018T21:37:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Tackles Nero with a hug
22-02-2018T21:37:58,NezumiYuki,Okay how about this question then?... Rained on Raine or rained on Flora?  :D
22-02-2018T21:38:05,ZRO4825,/
22-02-2018T21:38:08,ZRO4825,Yes!
22-02-2018T21:38:13,Bgrmystr2,"Nezumi, why not both?"
22-02-2018T21:38:14,unsteddyphoenix,I heard that the average american gun owner owns like 3 guns or something...
22-02-2018T21:38:15,Nekonny,Trying to figure out a faster way to paint this
22-02-2018T21:38:16,Ordithus,Raine on Flora
22-02-2018T21:38:21,ZRO4825,Stop with these question that always end in yes! XD
22-02-2018T21:38:21,CrimsonHelsing,I second that
22-02-2018T21:38:25,neropan,control f
22-02-2018T21:38:26,Ordithus,:ptv-ohmy:
22-02-2018T21:38:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,@unsteddyphoenix I have four..... so maybe true
22-02-2018T21:38:34,NezumiYuki,OMG @Ordithus  Good answer!
22-02-2018T21:38:39,ZRO4825,I can partially explain that Unsteddy.
22-02-2018T21:38:40,BluePhantom90,You do know sage a student in Ohio used a car to run over students and stab them. Took a Guy with a gun to stop him which was a security officer.
22-02-2018T21:38:45,CrimsonHelsing,*second @Ordithus 's notion
22-02-2018T21:39:04,BrunoYcaro,"hello people,how y'all doing today"
22-02-2018T21:39:10,BluePhantom90,eh okay
22-02-2018T21:39:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Bruno
22-02-2018T21:39:23,Sammit,HI Bruno
22-02-2018T21:39:24,TorqueEmUp,Well one right doesn't automatically correct a wrong.
22-02-2018T21:39:30,SageSaga,im well aware that if someone really wants to kill someone they can Blue- but for some reason a weapon made to kill people does it really well
22-02-2018T21:39:34,FatCowMom,hello
22-02-2018T21:39:34,NezumiYuki,TGed Mike and Evals or TGed Eric?
22-02-2018T21:39:35,CrimsonHelsing,agreed Torque
22-02-2018T21:39:38,ZRO4825,"See, the thing is, at least for those who hunt, there are (for some stupid reason) different seasons for specific weapons for specific targets. So, like, a few weeks are shotgun week for deer, another set of weeks is rifles for deer. Why? Dunno. Silly."
22-02-2018T21:39:41,MuonNeutrino,"boy, this chat is a lot more depressing than usual"
22-02-2018T21:39:43,CrimsonHelsing,"I mean, it doesn't work that way"
22-02-2018T21:39:58,ZRO4825,"Well, actually it's usually split between rifle/shotgun and muzzleloaders, iirc."
22-02-2018T21:40:00,CrimsonHelsing,"I just got here, haven't really noticed the depressing parts"
22-02-2018T21:40:02,Ordithus,"Actually asking, ZRO?"
22-02-2018T21:40:02,ZRO4825,But yeah.
22-02-2018T21:40:05,ZRO4825,No
22-02-2018T21:40:07,ZRO4825,Explaining
22-02-2018T21:40:10,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh I see.
22-02-2018T21:40:15,Ordithus,Got it.
22-02-2018T21:40:20,unsteddyphoenix,I can see that
22-02-2018T21:40:25,unsteddyphoenix,Plus there are collectors and stuff
22-02-2018T21:40:27,ZRO4825,"But yeah, so you need a different gun to hunt during different pieces of the hunting seasons."
22-02-2018T21:40:35,BluePhantom90,If the guy in Florida really wanted high body counts he should have used a 12 gauge Shotgun
22-02-2018T21:40:37,ZRO4825,"And yeah, collectors are definitely a thing, just like any other hobby/field."
22-02-2018T21:40:37,Ordithus,Bow seasons last a loooong time
22-02-2018T21:40:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,you are actually 4 times more likely to be stabed to death in the u.s then get shoot by a rifle. so says the FBI so take it with a grain of salt
22-02-2018T21:40:51,SageSaga,im not even anti gun - i just think the idea that a gun is a god given right is retarded
22-02-2018T21:40:59,TorqueEmUp,^
22-02-2018T21:41:11,ZRO4825,"God given? Nope. 2nd amendment however, yes."
22-02-2018T21:41:12,146Time,The issue with guns is enfranchisement
22-02-2018T21:41:18,TorqueEmUp,There is no simple solution
22-02-2018T21:41:21,unsteddyphoenix,Shot by a rifle specifically?
22-02-2018T21:41:22,146Time,Or disenfranchisement in this case
22-02-2018T21:41:31,unsteddyphoenix,Seems like a misleading statistic
22-02-2018T21:41:43,TorqueEmUp,"People just keep looking for a simple solution, and that's not going to work."
22-02-2018T21:41:46,unsteddyphoenix,What is the stab:gun ratio
22-02-2018T21:41:49,SageSaga,the NRA has stated that our rights are given by god not by man and thus a god given right to bear arms- that why i said god given
22-02-2018T21:41:52,BluePhantom90,I was shot at before I rather get shot at a rifle then a Shotgun.
22-02-2018T21:41:52,146Time,Taking away guns from the populace is fundamentally done on the grounds that they cannot be considered fit to carry them
22-02-2018T21:42:05,unsteddyphoenix,TIL the founding fathers were gods :O
22-02-2018T21:42:11,ZRO4825,"My only thing I have a beef with, is the anti-gun lobby wants to just straight-up disarm the populace. And that is just making us a damned target. :("
22-02-2018T21:42:19,Bgrmystr2,"Exactly, Zro"
22-02-2018T21:42:21,ZRO4825,"Well, part of the anti-gun lobby, I should say."
22-02-2018T21:42:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"handguns are the leading cause of gun violence unsteddy, but that includes home deference, home disputes, and suicide"
22-02-2018T21:42:48,BluePhantom90,And Heroin has killed more people then guns now
22-02-2018T21:42:50,unsteddyphoenix,I would count home disputes lol
22-02-2018T21:42:53,ZRO4825,"And that's another thing. What all is being lumped in with ""gun violence"" anyway?"
22-02-2018T21:43:13,SageSaga,yeah - i want people to abandon the idea of it being a right because thats the hook up - i think proper study and an actual digital background check system should be utilized-
22-02-2018T21:43:18,ZRO4825,"Disputes between 2 people involving a gun, I would count. Suicides imo should be a different category."
22-02-2018T21:43:19,Bgrmystr2,"Probably a lot more than what it's supposed to be, zro, to make it look worse than it is"
22-02-2018T21:43:21,SageSaga,but a lot of it is still paper
22-02-2018T21:43:35,146Time,"But see, once you start studying enfranchisement, you get on very dangerous ground"
22-02-2018T21:43:47,ZRO4825,"Also, who took Nyna fishing? XD"
22-02-2018T21:43:52,SageSaga,yeah learning is so dangerous
22-02-2018T21:43:55,BluePhantom90,Um sage there is background checks... I went though one last year getting a rifle
22-02-2018T21:44:10,SageSaga,did i say there are no background checks?
22-02-2018T21:44:18,BrunoYcaro,"in Brazil,Lula da silva disarmed the entire population every good citizen needed to give up his gun,bandits and ""traficantes"" didn't gave up their assault rifles and .50 cals"
22-02-2018T21:44:25,146Time,"God, I am too busy to fucking discuss this properly, god damn this timing"
22-02-2018T21:44:29,Bgrmystr2,"I don't think arming ourselves should not be a right, I just don't think it's a god-given right. It's a right we have to bear in order to protect ourselves from a rouge government"
22-02-2018T21:44:31,BrunoYcaro,and now we have per year 60.000 murders by guns
22-02-2018T21:44:35,Nekonny,guns that auto-disable when within 1000 feet of a school
22-02-2018T21:44:36,ItsActuallyKopyKat,I've got the metal version of this song!
22-02-2018T21:44:41,ItsActuallyKopyKat,it's excellent
22-02-2018T21:45:05,unsteddyphoenix,lol ron knows
22-02-2018T21:45:05,ZRO4825,"Nice idea, Nekonny, but won't work. Just like self-driving cars won't be the only thing on the road for a LONG time, because they have to share that space with older models."
22-02-2018T21:45:06,Nekonny,we put a car in space...
22-02-2018T21:45:09,ZRO4825,"Also, fuck self-driving cars. D:"
22-02-2018T21:45:13,TorqueEmUp,"Indeed, but a background check ain't going to find anything on a guy with a clean history that could still potentially go shoot up some place tomorrow."
22-02-2018T21:45:19,unsteddyphoenix,GIVE ME SELF DRIVING CARS
22-02-2018T21:45:25,unsteddyphoenix,DONT FUCK THEM
22-02-2018T21:45:29,146Time,we need self driving cars
22-02-2018T21:45:29,BluePhantom90,"The issue is FBI was warned on Cruz twice, Police talked to him 69 times and student and teachers knew of his actions. and nothing was done"
22-02-2018T21:45:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,no self driving cars please
22-02-2018T21:45:34,ZRO4825,You keep your silly self-driving cars. And keep'em off my road :O
22-02-2018T21:45:40,Ordithus,"What could be done, legally?"
22-02-2018T21:45:43,146Time,The cars drive better than you do?
22-02-2018T21:45:43,neropan,guns that turns into school buses
22-02-2018T21:45:44,Bgrmystr2,"The internet will be happy to take you up on your statement about those cars, Zro :P"
22-02-2018T21:45:47,unsteddyphoenix,I will FIGHT you while my car drives itself
22-02-2018T21:45:50,SageSaga,yeah which is why theres more we need to do
22-02-2018T21:46:14,TorqueEmUp,I agree fuck autonomous cars
22-02-2018T21:46:16,TorqueEmUp,:P
22-02-2018T21:46:18,Ordithus,It is absurdly difficult to take firearms away from someont that isn't either a felon or has been comitted
22-02-2018T21:46:18,BluePhantom90,well conceal carry is always a option
22-02-2018T21:46:27,SageSaga,"theres no one solution- we need the ability to properly research and manage it and so long as people say ""This is a right not a privilege"" it makes it hard"
22-02-2018T21:46:40,Nekonny,Or you could follow the literal word of law and not take away the guns... just make ammo illegal.
22-02-2018T21:46:44,TorqueEmUp,"I don't mind if other people use it, but I want to be in control on my own car dammit."
22-02-2018T21:47:09,146Time,"Have you seen what automatic cars can do for traffic management? Traffic jams, gone!"
22-02-2018T21:47:10,146Time,Gone!
22-02-2018T21:47:13,146Time,Totally gone!
22-02-2018T21:47:19,ZRO4825,"^ What Torque said. I'm worried it's gonna turn into ""Oh, we have self-driving cars now. Now EVERYONE MUST USE ONE."""
22-02-2018T21:47:21,Combak,"Eventually, the cost of insurance might make you change your mind Torque."
22-02-2018T21:47:22,Nekonny,Get ready to pay insane insurance for not having a self driving car
22-02-2018T21:47:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'd pay it
22-02-2018T21:47:34,Ordithus,"I'd do it, but only because I like driving."
22-02-2018T21:47:37,ZRO4825,same
22-02-2018T21:47:43,Ordithus,I'd take an automated car as well though
22-02-2018T21:47:51,Nekonny,YOu wouldn't be able to afford it eventually
22-02-2018T21:47:52,TorqueEmUp,Ammo does need some serious regulation. Because it is 100% unregulated. I can walk into walmart and buy 12gauge shotgun rounds off the shelf.
22-02-2018T21:47:54,Ordithus,"Commutes, long drives... it would be nice"
22-02-2018T21:47:57,Combak,"Also, the more cars that can drive themselves, the safer it should become."
22-02-2018T21:47:57,SageSaga,the end of driving is coming folks
22-02-2018T21:48:01,Adamb111,They will become too smarta and start killing us.
22-02-2018T21:48:03,Nekonny,yup
22-02-2018T21:48:07,SageSaga,its the logical conclusion
22-02-2018T21:48:15,Ordithus,"Racetracks, then"
22-02-2018T21:48:17,ZRO4825,"i'm the kind of crazy bastard who refuses to own an automatic still in this day and age. You're in for one HELL of a fight with me, lol."
22-02-2018T21:48:25,TorqueEmUp,"Eventually, but self driving cars are still a long way off."
22-02-2018T21:48:28,SageSaga,it will be an easy fight Zro
22-02-2018T21:48:30,BluePhantom90,"Sage its just sounds more like you calling all gun owners evil because we have the right to own them, but you think Guns are evil. Its not the gun its the person. And the most deadly weapon in the world is the Human mind"
22-02-2018T21:48:33,SageSaga,you dont have a right to drive
22-02-2018T21:48:42,ZRO4825,"About as easy a fight as gun rights, yes/no?"
22-02-2018T21:48:43,SageSaga,I didnt call anyone evil
22-02-2018T21:48:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,you have the right to travel
22-02-2018T21:49:08,unsteddyphoenix,People who dont like self driving cars are all evil
22-02-2018T21:49:08,SageSaga,see this is the problem- you already have all these ideas about what i think- when i said none of it just because i appose part of what you believe
22-02-2018T21:49:13,146Time,"Sage, I'm just curious, do you believe people have any rights? Like any rights specifically?"
22-02-2018T21:49:19,SageSaga,i dont want to take away your guns

22-02-2018T21:49:34,Twokinds,I'll brb
22-02-2018T21:49:36,146Time,I'm curious what rights you beleive a human being is entitled to.
22-02-2018T21:49:38,Sammit,Hi Midnight
22-02-2018T21:49:40,TorqueEmUp,okie dokie Tom

22-02-2018T21:49:41,NezumiYuki,hope you could save your work Tom!  -(
22-02-2018T21:49:44,NezumiYuki,=(
22-02-2018T21:49:48,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Still looks awesome, as always"
22-02-2018T21:49:51,Twokinds,"Uh, I did"
22-02-2018T21:49:55,MidnightBlue78,MARV!!!!!!!!!!! *Hugs back*
22-02-2018T21:49:57,NezumiYuki,Ah good good!
22-02-2018T21:49:59,SageSaga,absolutely - we have rights granted by the government and some of them we shouldnt have- we should have plenty of privilages
22-02-2018T21:50:17,CrRAR,"I too think it is reasonable that gun ownership should be like driving, can be dented or revoked."
22-02-2018T21:50:23,CrRAR,MAkes perfect sense
22-02-2018T21:50:26,Ordithus,dented lol
22-02-2018T21:50:28,ZRO4825,I agree with that.
22-02-2018T21:50:31,Bgrmystr2,"""dented"" xD"
22-02-2018T21:50:34,CrRAR,*denied
22-02-2018T21:50:35,Zakuru,hue
22-02-2018T21:50:35,TorqueEmUp,agreed as well
22-02-2018T21:50:36,CrRAR,XD
22-02-2018T21:50:38,146Time,"No, I mean in abstract. The principle of rights is that they are above the government and the government shouldn't be able to take them away. That's what the bill of rights was for."
22-02-2018T21:50:44,BluePhantom90,"I think a Human has the right to do what ever he wants, besides those that break the law."
22-02-2018T21:50:54,NezumiYuki,Here's hoping nothing go borked on Tom's machine!
22-02-2018T21:50:57,146Time,They were acknowledging there were some things even the government shouldn't be able to trod upon.
22-02-2018T21:51:13,Nekonny,Back then though
22-02-2018T21:51:14,Bgrmystr2,"Cr, if the govt ever goes rogue, they can just take away the ""privilage"" that everyone has of owning a gun"
22-02-2018T21:51:30,Nekonny,a militia could take down an army
22-02-2018T21:51:30,Bgrmystr2,And there'd be nothing we can do to stop it
22-02-2018T21:51:32,TorqueEmUp,But that doesn't make guns disappear BGR. :P
22-02-2018T21:51:33,SageSaga,yeah- what most people consider basic human rights
22-02-2018T21:51:34,Nekonny,nowerdays its no contest
22-02-2018T21:51:45,SageSaga,some of them i think are universal - not all
22-02-2018T21:51:57,146Time,And what do you feel are universal rights sage?
22-02-2018T21:51:59,BluePhantom90,If I want to buy a Tank I should be allowed to buy a tank! If I wanted a 2 Vulcan anti-aircraft gun I should be allowed to buy it lol
22-02-2018T21:52:05,146Time,"Like, enumerate a few"
22-02-2018T21:52:06,Bgrmystr2,"Of course not, Torque. But it would make them fundamentally harder to get"
22-02-2018T21:52:16,NezumiYuki,Okay what was that I say in the comments awhile back?   Who drives automatics only?   Is that even a thing?  XD  Sorry I kinda grew up with a stick so... yeah...
22-02-2018T21:52:21,NezumiYuki,I saw*
22-02-2018T21:52:27,Sammit,is also needed to reduce what causes people to use violence to such degree that harms others than just reducing the means to do it
22-02-2018T21:52:27,TorqueEmUp,Not if you already own them. You know there would be a huge black market for them.
22-02-2018T21:52:29,Ordithus,"Most Americans, Yuki"
22-02-2018T21:52:47,TorqueEmUp,You just couldn't walk into walmart anymore and buy one.
22-02-2018T21:53:02,CrRAR,yeh
22-02-2018T21:53:04,Bgrmystr2,"which is the reason it's a right, not a privilage, Torque."
22-02-2018T21:53:07,ZRO4825,I've met so many people who can't drive a stick. It always makes me a little more sad. :(
22-02-2018T21:53:08,Nekonny,"Gun ownership is already a privilege and not a right, considering that you are not allowed to own a gun under some circumstances"
22-02-2018T21:53:13,SageSaga,the right to life and bodily autonomy - but even these rights i can see having restrictions on
22-02-2018T21:53:16,CrRAR,mmm
22-02-2018T21:53:31,Bgrmystr2,"2nd amendment is the right to bear arms, Ron lol"
22-02-2018T21:53:37,ZRO4825,"Rights, imo, should be food, water, living quarters, and healthcare."
22-02-2018T21:53:46,Ordithus,"And the right to a well-regulated militia, bgr"
22-02-2018T21:53:50,CrRAR,If anything purchasing of rifles should be closer to the experience of getting a concealed carry permit.
22-02-2018T21:53:54,Bgrmystr2,"Indeed, Ord"
22-02-2018T21:53:57,TorqueEmUp,"Not like our lives aren't already under control anyway, we only have the freedom they allow"
22-02-2018T21:54:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,to maintain a free state
22-02-2018T21:54:07,Bgrmystr2,"Which is the problem, Torque"
22-02-2018T21:54:09,146Time,"So what's the minimum? ""Some restictions"" is pretty vague."
22-02-2018T21:54:16,Ordithus,I think you missed my point :P
22-02-2018T21:54:25,CrRAR,Interview with police officer... and maybe jack up the age of legal purchase
22-02-2018T21:54:29,SageSaga,i dont have all day to explain how your rights shouldnt infringe on others
22-02-2018T21:54:42,NezumiYuki,Hope Tom's pc is okay... hope toms pc is okay... hope toms pc is okayyyyyyyyyyyyy
22-02-2018T21:54:51,SageSaga,and yet all rights should be limited in such a way that they would protect others and yourself
22-02-2018T21:54:55,146Time,"But that's impossible. It's an impossible dream. We live in a finite, closed system. Simply being alive infringes on others."
22-02-2018T21:54:57,Sammit,people that really wants a gun can get one even if is illegal is proven(in american history) when alcohol became illegal there was still means to get some
22-02-2018T21:55:12,ZRO4825,"I'm sure it is. It's not like it had a critical meltdown. It was just acting up, most likely nothing a restart won't fix."
22-02-2018T21:55:23,Combak,Um... Tom?
22-02-2018T21:55:23,SageSaga,so whats your idea?
22-02-2018T21:55:27,ZRO4825,I see Yuki in Ron's comic. \[T]/
22-02-2018T21:55:31,Bgrmystr2,"Tom restarted, Combak"
22-02-2018T21:55:32,CrRAR,Yeah but making it a littleeee harder would potentially keep it out of a crazy person's hands
22-02-2018T21:55:39,Nekonny,cabn you own a gun if you are a fellon?
22-02-2018T21:55:44,Combak,"Yeah, I see it not."
22-02-2018T21:55:46,Ordithus,Depends on the state
22-02-2018T21:55:49,Combak,*now
22-02-2018T21:56:17,Bgrmystr2,"Unlikely, Cr. The black market does not ask questions."
22-02-2018T21:56:28,SageSaga,how does my being alive infringe on Ron's being alive?
22-02-2018T21:56:34,NezumiYuki,Sorry what now?  Yuki is being featured?  :D  Whom by might I ask?  And when was this?  And more importatnly... Why did I not know about it?  XD
22-02-2018T21:56:41,CrRAR,I just find it funny that legal drinking age in America is 21 but you can buy a rifle younger XD
22-02-2018T21:56:41,Nekonny,I'm not having much sucess with this
22-02-2018T21:56:56,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah that is pretty weird
22-02-2018T21:56:58,CrRAR,How is that not laughable?
22-02-2018T21:57:03,BluePhantom90,I wish I had the money for this though lol https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR0t9fIOjRs
22-02-2018T21:57:04,Nekonny,"How about they do a test, tun in thir guns for 10 years and see what happens"
22-02-2018T21:57:06,146Time,"He can hear you right now. Experience your ideas, experience those influenced by your ideas. If you are in disagreement, then the two of you will inevitably be in conflict."
22-02-2018T21:57:14,unsteddyphoenix,"One way or another, I think we can all agree that that's ridiculous"
22-02-2018T21:57:21,Nekonny,yup
22-02-2018T21:57:39,NezumiYuki,pokes TwoKinds... uh... Tom... U okay?
22-02-2018T21:57:40,Nekonny,"wait, whats happenig with yuki?"
22-02-2018T21:57:54,NezumiYuki,yeah I wanna know!
22-02-2018T21:58:04,Ordithus,I'd be all for firearm safety being part of education.  Tons of firearm deaths/injuries are accidental
22-02-2018T21:58:08,TorqueEmUp,bleh guess I should put away the left over pizza
22-02-2018T21:58:15,Nekonny,cant focus
22-02-2018T21:58:18,Ordithus,And considering they're everywhere
22-02-2018T21:58:26,Bgrmystr2,"Lol Nezumi, did you ignore the several times when it was talked about where Tom went? xD"
22-02-2018T21:58:30,NezumiYuki,can relate with the neko
22-02-2018T21:58:32,Bgrmystr2,He restarted
22-02-2018T21:58:36,TorqueEmUp,Then maybe you need a new lens Nek. :P
22-02-2018T21:58:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Yeah NERO \o/

22-02-2018T23:00:47,Bgrmystr2,probably like she always does
22-02-2018T23:01:07,Bgrmystr2,since she likely swims like she does everything else. Without clothing.
22-02-2018T23:01:13,NezumiYuki,then wonders what miss poofy chest woof might look like in a diving suit*
22-02-2018T23:01:13,Twokinds,I've been playing a lot of subnautica too
22-02-2018T23:01:14,ZRO4825,"Knowing Flora? The look of ""Oh god why did I fart in here? @.@"""

22-02-2018T23:02:00,Whitestripes,I watched markiplier play subnautica. It was hilarious
22-02-2018T23:02:18,NezumiYuki,"Nah Lion, I was thinking Natani might look better in a more contemporary face mask and tight suit.  xD"
22-02-2018T23:02:31,NezumiYuki,oh god
22-02-2018T23:02:35,NezumiYuki,Speaking of which
22-02-2018T23:02:45,ZRO4825,I put like 80 hours into Subnautica pre-release. Right now Monster Hunter has my soul. XD
22-02-2018T23:02:48,NezumiYuki,Now I gotta go back and watch that other loud mouth Fischback on youtube
22-02-2018T23:02:54,SageSaga,im just glad Mark isnt playing MHW - i would have to resist asking Tom to slap him for me

22-02-2018T23:04:47,NezumiYuki,"he ""Got Over It"""
22-02-2018T23:04:50,ZRO4825,"Maybe we should ask Tom. Does Mark truly suck, or is it all a show? :thinking:"
22-02-2018T23:04:57,Whitestripes,"Well, its more entertaining that way"
22-02-2018T23:05:05,EnergisticAnomaly,I always loved the dark bowser battle.
22-02-2018T23:05:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I know from experience when your talking and playing, you skill level drops hard"

22-02-2018T23:08:15,Ordithus,There's just no way.
22-02-2018T23:08:29,CrimsonHelsing,"take a guess, Mark simply told him. they talk to each other y'know xD"
22-02-2018T23:08:38,NezumiYuki,%^ THIS
22-02-2018T23:08:39,unsteddyphoenix,( I choose to believe that you all thought it was sincere)
22-02-2018T23:08:55,Whitestripes,"I admit, I was blown away when I found out he was Tom's brother"
22-02-2018T23:08:59,EnergisticAnomaly,But mark knows tom tom doesnt know mark.... lost sibling AU anyone?
22-02-2018T23:09:14,TorqueEmUp,Subnautica was pretty friggin sweet though

22-02-2018T23:11:53,TorqueEmUp,"Same here white, but Subnautica was just right up my alley."
22-02-2018T23:12:22,TorqueEmUp,"I usually despise Indy titles, but every once in a while, a really good one catches my eye."
22-02-2018T23:12:28,ZRO4825,Subnautica's in a genre I typically AVOID. But it hits an awesome spot that's just right. &lt;3
22-02-2018T23:12:29,Whitestripes,True
22-02-2018T23:13:04,EnergisticAnomaly,I think subnauseous will be one of the games i stick to watching rather than playing myself.
22-02-2018T23:13:09,Whitestripes,I just stick to the triple A titles usually. Maybe I should branch out
22-02-2018T23:13:29,EnergisticAnomaly,I loved a hat in time by gears for breakfast.
22-02-2018T23:13:38,EnergisticAnomaly,If anyone’s heard of that one.

22-02-2018T23:14:56,TorqueEmUp,I played it for like 5 minutes lol
22-02-2018T23:14:56,Whitestripes,"Yeah, I mostly just got into the lore"
22-02-2018T23:15:02,EnergisticAnomaly,^^
22-02-2018T23:15:11,EnergisticAnomaly,Im more for the lore than the game.
