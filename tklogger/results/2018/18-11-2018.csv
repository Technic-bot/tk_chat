18-11-2018T00:06:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Hey Tom here‚Äôs an odd question but have you ever had deer meat
18-11-2018T00:24:30,Twokinds,"As far as I know, no."
18-11-2018T00:40:28,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúAs far as I know‚Äù. That sounds concerning but ok cool
18-11-2018T00:42:01,Twokinds,"Well, I can't say difinitively. I've eaten a lot of processed meat."
18-11-2018T00:42:09,Twokinds,Who knows what could be in sometimes that I don't know about.
18-11-2018T00:42:29,Twokinds,It's always possible
18-11-2018T00:42:47,Twokinds,"I have not, to the best of my knowledge, intentionally eaten deer meat."
18-11-2018T00:43:58,unsteddyphoenix,Thats...true...but I dont want to think about it.
18-11-2018T00:48:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Deer has to be processed on its own. Only then could it be added to stuff like beef or whatever. And I‚Äôve never known of anywhere or anyone that cuts deer or beef with the other
18-11-2018T00:49:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though I guess if you‚Äôve never had it or have never been told you‚Äôre having it, you‚Äôd take the difference in taste as part of the meal. But deer does taste different"
18-11-2018T00:50:15,Twokinds,True. It's probably unlikely I've eaten deer.
18-11-2018T00:50:22,Twokinds,I wouldn't be opposed to trying it.
18-11-2018T00:52:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"I was just wondering. Deer season around here, I don‚Äôt know for sure the timing, but it brings people making deer stew, deer jerky, and (wait for it) ‚Äúsloppy doe‚Äôs‚Äù"
18-11-2018T00:52:41,Twokinds,lol
18-11-2018T00:52:48,Twokinds,Sloppy Doe's. That's good
18-11-2018T00:54:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Even better is that it‚Äôs the guys they shoot for meat. Females are only killed if they‚Äôre shot accidentally
18-11-2018T00:54:44,Bgrmystr2,lol I never liked sloppy joes
18-11-2018T00:54:51,Bgrmystr2,"my dad made em when I was a kid, but"
18-11-2018T00:54:52,Bgrmystr2,ehh
18-11-2018T00:54:53,SpazztasticKiwi,But ‚Äúsloppy bucks‚Äù doesn‚Äôt have quite the same ring
18-11-2018T00:54:54,Bgrmystr2,not a fan
18-11-2018T00:55:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Me either
18-11-2018T00:55:54,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs not awful but it‚Äôs just something about the taste that disinterests me. But I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd like it Tom
18-11-2018T00:57:26,SpazztasticKiwi,As you‚Äôre not a picky eater
18-11-2018T01:07:18,Twokinds,Heheh
18-11-2018T01:12:33,Vatruvius,Hello! :ptv-greetings:
18-11-2018T01:12:54,Vatruvius,Still a fair amount of people on...
18-11-2018T01:13:08,SpazztasticKiwi,And here‚Äôs another question: you think the butterflies in TK make butter and that‚Äôs why Flora finds them tasty?
18-11-2018T01:13:47,MrEase,Flora finds everything tasty
18-11-2018T01:14:38,Vatruvius,"How's this for an ominous villain name, The Author?"
18-11-2018T01:15:36,Vatruvius,Or something similar?
18-11-2018T01:16:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Sure
18-11-2018T01:16:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Also you guys know there‚Äôs Christmas lights for beards
18-11-2018T01:16:29,Vatruvius,"Okay, Author or Architect? And what...!?"
18-11-2018T01:17:20,SpazztasticKiwi,The author sounds good. You can be an author of architecture too
18-11-2018T01:17:33,Vatruvius,True...
18-11-2018T01:18:02,SpazztasticKiwi,And yes. Beard lights. Now all we need is a star sticker on the nose and little clip on baubles
18-11-2018T01:18:26,Vatruvius,Huh...
18-11-2018T01:18:35,Vatruvius,Well I just shaved today so...
18-11-2018T01:18:44,Vatruvius,And might I add it is so freeing...
18-11-2018T01:21:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve never shaved my face :ctwokinds-smug:
18-11-2018T01:21:29,SpazztasticKiwi,My beard is so legendary you can‚Äôt see it
18-11-2018T01:21:39,Vatruvius,Well I would hope you wouldn't have too.
18-11-2018T01:21:40,Vatruvius,lol
18-11-2018T01:21:41,Vatruvius,XD
18-11-2018T01:22:01,Vatruvius,The most legendary of legendary beards...
18-11-2018T01:25:34,Vatruvius,"Not to sound too self-involved/egotistical, but every time I read my plot it sounds REALLY good. Er...sub-plot rather. But still..."
18-11-2018T01:26:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Not even written yet and he‚Äôs on the high horse:ctwokinds-eyeroll:
18-11-2018T01:27:42,Vatruvius,"Well EXCUSE me...but it does sound really good. Perhaps from all the content I have played, read, and watched, this would be something I would be engrossed in."
18-11-2018T01:28:21,Vatruvius,That and those who know of my project and have helped me a little bit agree that the plot sounds good.
18-11-2018T01:29:25,Vatruvius,"I guess at the end of the day, as long as I enjoy it then it is good because I am doing this because it is a creative outlet. If others like it, bonus points."
18-11-2018T01:34:12,SpazztasticKiwi,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
18-11-2018T01:34:33,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs bound to strike a match with someone
18-11-2018T01:34:46,SpazztasticKiwi,If not a bunch of someones
18-11-2018T01:35:06,Vatruvius,Ouch...*glass shattering*
18-11-2018T01:35:19,Vatruvius,lol
18-11-2018T01:35:36,Vatruvius,"Read that ""If"" as ""It's"""
18-11-2018T01:35:52,Vatruvius,I am way too tired.
18-11-2018T01:37:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Fixing to say.  I don‚Äôt believe any of that could come across as anything mean
18-11-2018T01:37:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera has chosen my leg as a pillow
18-11-2018T01:37:44,SpazztasticKiwi,He snooze
18-11-2018T01:38:53,Vatruvius,"I got that, I just misread that last part into a burn."
18-11-2018T01:39:49,Vatruvius,I suppose I could work on finishing the entire plot of my webcomic. I just do not know how long that will take or how long the end webcomic will be.
18-11-2018T01:40:30,Vatruvius,I know it is probably going to take me years to draw out.
18-11-2018T01:41:01,Vatruvius,I guess it comes down to finding a balance to working in the present of the webcomic and the future of it.
18-11-2018T01:41:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Make sure you‚Äôre working on a full tank. Writing while sleep deprived isn‚Äôt a good practice
18-11-2018T01:41:54,Vatruvius,I won't fall asleep for another hour and a half minimum.
18-11-2018T01:42:11,Vatruvius,But this is about the only time I can work on it.
18-11-2018T01:42:34,Vatruvius,And listening to soothing music helps...clears my head of any other thoughts I might have other than the webcomic.
18-11-2018T01:44:41,Vatruvius,:face_palm:
18-11-2018T01:45:01,Vatruvius,"Ugh, just realized I still have to make a calendar for my world."
18-11-2018T01:46:02,Vatruvius,"I have known this for a while now, but I am too impatient to take around 8 months creating everything!"
18-11-2018T01:46:31,Vatruvius,"Brain, can't you just kick yourself into overdrive and think up everything this second?"
18-11-2018T01:47:38,SpazztasticKiwi,üß† ‚Äú.....nah‚Äù
18-11-2018T01:47:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I need to go to bed
18-11-2018T01:48:06,Vatruvius,Darn you! if you weren't a vital part of my body I would show you a thing or two.
18-11-2018T01:48:11,Vatruvius,"Alright, goodnight!"
18-11-2018T01:48:17,SpazztasticKiwi,But I‚Äôll have to think about it first
18-11-2018T01:49:20,Vatruvius,"""Hmm...I need to go to bed but does it have to be RIGHT now or could if be a few minutes from now?"" *A few minutes later.* ""Maybe a few more minutes?"""
18-11-2018T01:51:58,Vatruvius,"See, now I have overloaded my brain with tasks to work on. That's it, bed time. I'll process this in the morning."
18-11-2018T01:52:06,Vatruvius,:ptv-greetings:
18-11-2018T01:54:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Bye
18-11-2018T01:54:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I need to get up. But kitty on lap. Asleep

18-11-2018T01:58:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I think he‚Äôs having a nightmare. All his fur is fluffed out

18-11-2018T02:01:14,Twokinds,Was it my loud g'night?
18-11-2018T02:02:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"I kinda poked at him. If he was having a dream that had his fuzz on end, it couldn‚Äôt been good"
18-11-2018T02:02:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"But yeah, let‚Äôs say you did. How dare"
18-11-2018T02:21:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Alright I‚Äôm goin to bed

18-11-2018T11:28:43,Sifty,it's depressing watching how good tom is
18-11-2018T12:04:19,Mippy,Morning
18-11-2018T12:05:20,Mippy,I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs depressing Sifty. Tom inspires me to get better at digital art and learn my program better
18-11-2018T12:12:07,Mippy,"See, this is what your fans think of you Tom. You a good boi"
18-11-2018T12:18:14,Sifty,"it's just seeing what tom does has made me finally stop putting off trying to make digital art myself, and it feels like i'll never even be nearly as good"
18-11-2018T12:19:08,TerraTheWizard,it just takes time
18-11-2018T12:19:11,TerraTheWizard,and sticking at it
18-11-2018T12:19:20,Sifty,"not to mention he started when he was 14 and never quit, and i'm only just starting now at 20"
18-11-2018T12:19:53,Sifty,"it's like, all the wasted years"
18-11-2018T12:20:26,TerraTheWizard,rule 1: never compare your progress to others
18-11-2018T12:20:35,Sifty,that's all I do
18-11-2018T12:20:42,TerraTheWizard,"yeah, it's hard to stop doing"
18-11-2018T12:20:57,TerraTheWizard,you gotta learn to compare yourself to where you were like 6 months ago

18-11-2018T12:21:58,Sifty,actually no

18-11-2018T16:35:30,TerraTheWizard,also :ctwokinds-MikeLewd:
18-11-2018T16:40:42,CrimsonQuill,"If I were to give up video games, university and basically everything except drawing, then maybe I could reach a professional level in about two years."
18-11-2018T16:41:29,CrimsonQuill,"Heck, if I stopped procrastinating so much, I'd have had that Doctor Who/Star Trek Crossover, a novel, and my own webcomic out, plus professional-quality surveying projects!"
18-11-2018T16:42:13,Twokinds,Better get started then!
18-11-2018T16:42:20,CrimsonQuill,You said it mate!
18-11-2018T16:42:31,CrimsonQuill,I do still draw occasionally...
18-11-2018T16:42:35,CrimsonQuill,Hmmm....
18-11-2018T16:42:55,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I won't learn playing Kerbal Space Program, that's for sure."
18-11-2018T16:43:57,CrimsonQuill,"But for now, it's late, I have camomile tea, and four volumes of the comic that need reading."
18-11-2018T16:44:04,CrimsonQuill,One chapter at a time.
18-11-2018T16:45:58,CrimsonQuill,"Oh, and I have to actually get past Undyne in Undertale. I promised my sister I would."
18-11-2018T16:46:07,CrimsonQuill,How long did it take you Tom?
18-11-2018T16:46:13,CrimsonQuill,To beat Undyne?
18-11-2018T16:47:59,TerraTheWizard,i've replayed undertale a bunch of times
18-11-2018T16:48:02,Twokinds,I never did Genocide
18-11-2018T16:48:08,TerraTheWizard,each time i forgot the trick to beating undyne
18-11-2018T16:48:16,TerraTheWizard,even though SHE SAYS IT IN BATTLE
18-11-2018T16:48:19,TerraTheWizard,heck
18-11-2018T16:48:21,Twokinds,"I went in blind, did Neutral, then Pacifist, and stopped."
18-11-2018T16:48:23,CrimsonQuill,"I'm not doing Genocide either, whatever that is."
18-11-2018T16:48:31,TerraTheWizard,"also yeah, i've only ever done true pacifist"
18-11-2018T16:48:33,CrimsonQuill,"I'm going blind, not killing anyone."
18-11-2018T16:48:38,TerraTheWizard,couldn't bring myself to do any other run
18-11-2018T16:48:48,CrimsonQuill,"I only know one spoiler, thank God."
18-11-2018T16:48:52,Twokinds,Oh then I won't tell you how to beat Undyne
18-11-2018T16:48:54,CrimsonQuill,And that was an accident.
18-11-2018T16:48:59,Twokinds,No spoilers
18-11-2018T16:49:06,CrimsonQuill,"No, my sister already tries to teach me."
18-11-2018T16:49:08,CrimsonQuill,and fails
18-11-2018T16:49:11,Twokinds,lol
18-11-2018T16:49:15,CrimsonQuill,"Still, i'm getting there,"
18-11-2018T16:49:25,CrimsonQuill,I'll serve her spaghetti!
18-11-2018T16:49:25,Twokinds,Good
18-11-2018T16:49:29,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
18-11-2018T16:49:30,Twokinds,Blind is the way to go!
18-11-2018T16:49:50,CrimsonQuill,You're fanart of it (with Toriel) was positively heartwarming.
18-11-2018T16:50:37,CrimsonQuill,"D'you know, when I started, i almost killed Toriel, because I didn't know how to spare her...then when I got her down to half health, I decided to just give up and spam mercy, see what happened."
18-11-2018T16:50:55,CrimsonQuill,Those who have played know the rest.
18-11-2018T16:51:43,Twokinds,Yeah Toriel is great
18-11-2018T16:51:53,CrimsonQuill,And Papyrus
18-11-2018T16:52:16,CrimsonQuill,My sister and I agree that Sans and Papyrus are some of the best characters in the game.
18-11-2018T16:52:19,TerraTheWizard,"there's also that fanart tom put on patreon waaay before there was any sketch streams, but i won't link that because it's maybe spoilery?"
18-11-2018T16:52:39,CrimsonQuill,"I'll probably find it when I finish the game anyway,"
18-11-2018T16:53:00,CrimsonQuill,It's so well done though! And I can't play DeltaRune until I've played Undertale!
18-11-2018T16:53:07,CrimsonQuill,Toby Fox is a genius.
18-11-2018T16:54:47,TerraTheWizard,i hope he gets a team to help with deltarune
18-11-2018T16:55:43,TerraTheWizard,devolver digital said they'd help if he wants them to
18-11-2018T16:57:19,CrimsonQuill,"When I've learned to draw, I might do some Subnautica art. Mark in Bubblebutt the Seamoth, and Tom in Big Box Barry the Cyclops, or Mr Fister the PRAWN Suit."
18-11-2018T16:57:36,CrimsonQuill,You two could be exploring the Lost River or Sand Dunes.
18-11-2018T16:58:50,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I'm going to head off. Goodnight everyone!"

18-11-2018T17:31:35,Bgrmystr2,someone woke me up mid-sleep with stupid loud music so here I am 2 hrs late for waking up
18-11-2018T17:32:02,TerraTheWizard,hi bgr
18-11-2018T17:33:12,RimaDraws,At least you didn't have your $200 stolen from you today
18-11-2018T17:33:23,RimaDraws,my money to pay bills
18-11-2018T17:33:53,RimaDraws,even my change was stolen
18-11-2018T17:34:23,Bgrmystr2,time is money
18-11-2018T17:34:41,Bgrmystr2,but that's one of the reasons why I don't go outside
18-11-2018T17:34:44,RimaDraws,yea well someone stole my hard earned money
18-11-2018T17:34:50,Bgrmystr2,report it :u
18-11-2018T17:35:01,RimaDraws,i did they can't do anything unless they catch them
18-11-2018T17:35:08,RimaDraws,i was bawling
18-11-2018T17:35:46,Bgrmystr2,tis why I'd tell someone trying to take my shit to take a hike. I ain't afraid of them.
18-11-2018T17:36:01,RimaDraws,yea well can't do that at my job
18-11-2018T17:36:28,Bgrmystr2,Yeah you can.
18-11-2018T17:37:08,Bgrmystr2,jobs only require you to allow them to take money if it's property of the store. They have insurance that covers thefts
18-11-2018T17:37:18,RimaDraws,well i wanted to jump the guy i thought did it
18-11-2018T17:37:24,RimaDraws,so i could get my money back
18-11-2018T17:37:45,RimaDraws,not my job
18-11-2018T17:37:47,RimaDraws,we dont have that
18-11-2018T17:37:51,Bgrmystr2,"if it's your personal money, then hell naw"
18-11-2018T17:38:03,RimaDraws,yea it was my personal money i earned working
18-11-2018T17:38:17,Bgrmystr2,then it's not going to be against you if you go against them
18-11-2018T17:38:18,Bgrmystr2,at all
18-11-2018T17:39:00,Bgrmystr2,"and jobs generally don't function without insurance. otherwise, they're not actually big enough to care if you wallop a theif"
18-11-2018T17:39:16,Bgrmystr2,"there's a line, you're either past it or not"
18-11-2018T17:39:54,Bgrmystr2,and the line doesn't apply to personal money unless they also insure their worker's money which.. in my experience doesn't happen a lot
18-11-2018T17:40:10,RimaDraws,yea well im gonna have to find a way to make that moneyback
18-11-2018T17:40:18,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-adiracoin:

18-11-2018T18:38:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Could be....burritos
18-11-2018T18:38:26,Bgrmystr2,but it was called a sandwich.
18-11-2018T18:38:29,Bgrmystr2,as the name.
18-11-2018T18:38:31,Bgrmystr2,clearly.
18-11-2018T18:38:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Well he said ‚Äúmake lunch for me‚Äù
18-11-2018T18:39:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I just happen to be having a sandwich. He could have the same or something different
18-11-2018T18:40:38,unsteddyphoenix,Burritos aren't sandwiches that's science
18-11-2018T18:41:32,Bgrmystr2,"but what if you name your burrito ""Sandwich"""
18-11-2018T18:41:33,RimaDraws,burritos are best
18-11-2018T18:41:48,SpazztasticKiwi,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:Brilliant
18-11-2018T18:42:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Like killing people with your sword named Kindness

18-11-2018T18:42:33,Twokinds,Burritos are the sandwiches of the sea
18-11-2018T18:42:38,Bgrmystr2,"sounds way better than it actually is, according to the rumors.."
18-11-2018T18:42:49,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
18-11-2018T18:42:52,Bgrmystr2,but they are probably just that.. rumors... *probably*
18-11-2018T18:43:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom you seem to have gotten a metaphor or two mixed up there
18-11-2018T18:43:16,Bgrmystr2,"it's fine, it's tom after all"
18-11-2018T18:43:33,SpazztasticKiwi,He‚Äôs delusional from lack o sandwich
18-11-2018T18:43:40,RimaDraws,i need my blanket
18-11-2018T18:44:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Kitty still nomming on toes
18-11-2018T18:45:59,SpazztasticKiwi,You guys have no idea how much this one guy just messed with who I believe is one of the new people
18-11-2018T18:46:49,SpazztasticKiwi,And I don‚Äôt like I only have 15 more minutes
18-11-2018T18:48:53,Twokinds,Ah good my new luxury bath robe arrived in the mail

18-11-2018T18:50:00,unsteddyphoenix,Robes are amazing
18-11-2018T18:50:08,SpazztasticKiwi,All the more to hibernate with
18-11-2018T18:50:42,Twokinds,It's fleece. Basically a long towel with sleeves.
18-11-2018T18:51:23,Twokinds,But it'll be warm when the temp drops
18-11-2018T18:52:05,unsteddyphoenix,Perrrfect
18-11-2018T18:52:13,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
18-11-2018T18:52:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm hoping CLOAK gets some robes in
18-11-2018T18:53:06,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs either that or see what monstrousities Victoria‚Äôs Secret has
18-11-2018T18:53:23,Twokinds,heheheh
18-11-2018T18:55:22,Twokinds,"I also bought a fleece blanket and comfortor for my bed. Queen size, despite only having a twin. I'm gunna go full hiberation. Not going to be cold this winter."
18-11-2018T18:55:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Which will also likely cost an arm and a leg and come in either bright pink or sheer
18-11-2018T18:55:37,TerraTheWizard,lol
18-11-2018T18:56:06,TerraTheWizard,"speaking of bed, i need sleep :ctwokinds-RainezZz:"
18-11-2018T18:56:12,TerraTheWizard,later dudes
18-11-2018T18:56:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Alrighty
18-11-2018T18:56:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Bye
18-11-2018T18:56:21,Twokinds,BYEYEYEYEY
18-11-2018T18:56:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I aim to get a queen bed sometime
18-11-2018T18:56:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"That way, there‚Äôs room for all"
18-11-2018T18:56:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Me and my cats
18-11-2018T18:59:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I gotta go back in
18-11-2018T19:00:05,unsteddyphoenix,Going to DEFEAT WINTER
18-11-2018T19:00:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll be back eventually
18-11-2018T19:00:15,unsteddyphoenix,Armed and ready
18-11-2018T19:00:31,unsteddyphoenix,Another method is just get a bunch of cats
18-11-2018T19:00:43,Twokinds,XD
18-11-2018T19:00:45,unsteddyphoenix,Warned each other
18-11-2018T19:00:46,Twokinds,NOOOOOOOOOO
18-11-2018T19:01:00,unsteddyphoenix,BUT WARM
18-11-2018T19:01:41,Twokinds,"The nice thing about having a twin bed is that queen sized blankets are, oddly, usually the same price as twin."
18-11-2018T19:01:52,Twokinds,So you can just get a bigger one and then just double it up if you're still cold.
18-11-2018T19:02:12,Twokinds,I'm guessing it's because queen is the most common size or something?
18-11-2018T19:02:13,RimaDraws,i have a twin bed
18-11-2018T19:02:13,Bgrmystr2,I was gonna say I have a queen bed now and want to get a king bed
18-11-2018T19:02:40,Bgrmystr2,"Queens are fairly common, but bedsheets are fairly equal in price actually"
18-11-2018T19:03:07,Bgrmystr2,king and california king sheets are only bout $5 more than queen
18-11-2018T19:03:14,Bgrmystr2,and twin are maybe $2-3 less?
18-11-2018T19:03:35,Bgrmystr2,"they're all about $30 or so, but they're not fleece"
18-11-2018T19:04:05,Bgrmystr2,they're all the same price cuz it costs *WAY* less to make them than we pay for them
18-11-2018T19:05:15,Bgrmystr2,the only reason I want a King bed is because you can put it down and lay on it either direction and the bed is long enough that it just doesn't matter.
18-11-2018T19:05:33,Bgrmystr2,w/ a king bed I can have a couple friends over and everyone has a space to sleep
18-11-2018T19:05:45,Bgrmystr2,and noone's legs hang off the edge
18-11-2018T19:06:27,Bgrmystr2,not a fun night to wake up from..
18-11-2018T19:08:16,unsteddyphoenix,If you all cuddle you can fit even more friends!
18-11-2018T19:09:09,Xexanoth,"just don't forget to say ""no homo"" after waking up"
18-11-2018T19:10:03,unsteddyphoenix,Oh ofc
18-11-2018T19:10:15,unsteddyphoenix,And no tongue when you're making out
18-11-2018T19:18:51,Bgrmystr2,xD
18-11-2018T19:18:55,Bgrmystr2,noone does that though
18-11-2018T19:22:09,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah ofc. That'd be gay.

18-11-2018T20:40:56,RimaDraws,i decided to stream too. have a bit of fun tonight
18-11-2018T21:11:51,Mippy,Is tempted to refer to Maddie‚Äôs daddy as ‚ÄúThe Queen‚Äù :ctwokinds-kingtea:
18-11-2018T21:35:58,Twokinds,Haha
18-11-2018T21:36:34,Twokinds,I just set up all the sketches for the next week to post automatically. That feels nice. Good to get it out of the way.
18-11-2018T21:38:49,Mippy,Awesome
18-11-2018T21:39:42,Bgrmystr2,nicely done tom
18-11-2018T21:39:47,Bgrmystr2,what time do they post?
18-11-2018T21:40:38,unsteddyphoenix,Oh hey nice. Is that a patreon feature?
18-11-2018T21:41:22,Twokinds,Noon
18-11-2018T21:41:45,Bgrmystr2,oo
18-11-2018T21:41:48,Bgrmystr2,very nice
18-11-2018T21:41:55,Bgrmystr2,so it'll be posted before I wake up
18-11-2018T21:42:00,Twokinds,"And yeah. It's really what I should do. Unfortunately, I'm sometimes lazy, which ends up costing my more time in the long run."
18-11-2018T21:42:20,Twokinds,Because I make the Patreon post and the thumbnail on the website each day. Instead of all in one go.
18-11-2018T21:45:36,unsteddyphoenix,It does seem infinitely easier to do it all in one go
18-11-2018T21:45:51,unsteddyphoenix,But habits are hard to get into~
18-11-2018T21:46:21,Twokinds,yeah my biggest hinderence in always doing it is that I often touch up sketches after the stream
18-11-2018T21:46:27,Twokinds,And that takes a lot of time.
18-11-2018T21:46:38,Twokinds,"But this week the sketches were pretty good as is, so it didn't take long."
18-11-2018T21:49:52,unsteddyphoenix,Do you end up waiting 'til the last minute to touch 'em up then post 'em?
18-11-2018T21:50:02,Twokinds,lol yeah usually
18-11-2018T21:50:13,unsteddyphoenix,I relate~
18-11-2018T21:50:38,unsteddyphoenix,The more time you leave the more time to obsess about it~
18-11-2018T21:50:48,unsteddyphoenix,Some touchups youve done have completely changed sketches
18-11-2018T21:51:19,Bgrmystr2,yeah the touchups are pretty groundbreaking sometmies
