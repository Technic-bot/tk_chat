02-12-2018T00:00:33,SpazztasticKiwi,What you said or “Berliner”?
02-12-2018T00:00:40,Ordithus,What Tom said
02-12-2018T00:00:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Cool
02-12-2018T00:00:59,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s also a doughnut
02-12-2018T00:01:27,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles::doughnut:
02-12-2018T00:01:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I was given a confusion
02-12-2018T00:01:56,Ordithus,Kiwi hurts herself in her confusion
02-12-2018T00:02:32,Dadrobit,"It was a reference in that in ancient times, ""Civis Romanus Sum"" (I am a Roman) was the proudest thing one could say. Kennedy said ""Ich bin ein Berliner"" (I am a Berliner) is the proudest thing one could say in the modern age."
02-12-2018T00:03:11,Dadrobit,It was a helluva speech.
02-12-2018T00:03:54,SpazztasticKiwi,So historical reference. Not one of a  pastry nature
02-12-2018T00:03:54,Dadrobit,He went on to crack a joke about appreciating his translator translating his German.
02-12-2018T00:04:12,SpazztasticKiwi,That makes more sense. And I’m sure was totally what Tom was shooting for
02-12-2018T00:04:41,Dadrobit,"Yeah, almost certainly."
02-12-2018T00:05:19,Ordithus,He was definitely referencing Kennedy's speech
02-12-2018T00:05:34,Dadrobit,"Sister took German ages ago, and I had a really excellent German foreign exchange student friend, so I was actually quite into the culture for a while. Hadn't watched that speech in ages."
02-12-2018T00:07:43,Dadrobit,"""Freedom has problems, Democracy is not perfect but we don't have to put a wall up to prevent our people from leaving us"""
02-12-2018T00:07:50,Dadrobit,Really great stuff in it.
02-12-2018T00:10:35,SpazztasticKiwi,My favorite speech probably gotta be I Have A Dream
02-12-2018T00:10:56,Ordithus,Ooh that's a good one
02-12-2018T00:11:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Studied it best in college. As a essay topic choice
02-12-2018T00:11:16,SpazztasticKiwi,an
02-12-2018T00:12:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"While he helps spur the rights movement for African Americans, he inspired the Women’s rights movement too"
02-12-2018T00:12:25,SpazztasticKiwi,helped (im distracted)
02-12-2018T00:12:48,Ordithus,Letters from Birmingham Jail are also fantastic
02-12-2018T00:20:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Not sure if I meant to ever read that but didn’t or have and don’t remember
02-12-2018T00:20:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I do remember coming across it
02-12-2018T00:20:50,Vatruvius,I am back!
02-12-2018T00:20:59,Ordithus,Welcome back!
02-12-2018T00:22:43,Vatruvius,"And I do not want to work on my program, but have to."
02-12-2018T00:32:43,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz: g'night
02-12-2018T00:32:53,Vatruvius,Goodnight Ord!
02-12-2018T00:32:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Night nite
02-12-2018T00:33:31,Vatruvius,"Okay, so I am really confused now."
02-12-2018T00:35:11,SpazztasticKiwi,:ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:
02-12-2018T00:35:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Mmmmk
02-12-2018T00:35:30,Vatruvius,"Sorry, I am confused about pants size for women."
02-12-2018T00:35:51,Vatruvius,I asked my mom about my sister's size and she said she is a 6.
02-12-2018T00:36:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"Depends on your astronomical sign, whether you’ve eaten beef in the past 24 hours, and what phase the moon is in emotionally"
02-12-2018T00:36:48,Vatruvius,"Wait, what?"
02-12-2018T00:36:54,SpazztasticKiwi,But you still won’t have pockets whatever your size
02-12-2018T00:37:11,Vatruvius,I am really confused...
02-12-2018T00:37:20,Vatruvius,Why not just have inch size like mens?
02-12-2018T00:37:42,Bgrmystr2,hahahaha kiwi yes
02-12-2018T00:37:50,Bgrmystr2,that's exactly what women's sizes are
02-12-2018T00:38:01,Bgrmystr2,and cuz that'd be too logical
02-12-2018T00:38:10,Bgrmystr2,and they wouldn't be able to overcharge out of the fucking ass
02-12-2018T00:38:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Because the clothing industry for women is broken
02-12-2018T00:38:41,Bgrmystr2,"guys just want something that feels comfortable and looks okay cuz the man makes the clothing, right, basically how guys work"
02-12-2018T00:39:00,SpazztasticKiwi,No one can determine a set for what sizes are what based on what
02-12-2018T00:39:50,Bgrmystr2,"yeah if you're a girl and you want a size of whatever, bar bras and stuff which men don't wear for obvious reasons, just get men's stuff and safe a few hundred bucks"
02-12-2018T00:40:03,Bgrmystr2,save* even
02-12-2018T00:40:06,SpazztasticKiwi,And it’s primarily because promoting something like that or doing it is frowned upon due to what $$$ now brings in
02-12-2018T00:40:23,Bgrmystr2,did not know save had an F in it. Learn somethin new from my idiot fingers every day
02-12-2018T00:40:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Bras are essentially the only things we can’t cross shop for
02-12-2018T00:40:50,Bgrmystr2,yeah prettymuch
02-12-2018T00:41:16,Vatruvius,"Okay, any attempt to try to make some sense from womens' sizes had gone the exact opposite direction..."
02-12-2018T00:41:27,Bgrmystr2,hahaha
02-12-2018T00:41:42,Bgrmystr2,is this the point where you stop trying to make sense of something that doesn't?
02-12-2018T00:41:46,Bgrmystr2,or will you still attempt?
02-12-2018T00:41:49,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s no logic. It’s why we try everything on that we pick up
02-12-2018T00:42:01,Bgrmystr2,^
02-12-2018T00:42:02,Vatruvius,"I'll just leave it where it is and if I am ever asked by my future girlfriend or whatever to pick out some clothes, I'll ask her to right down her sizes."
02-12-2018T00:42:36,Bgrmystr2,or just find out what size she is in men's and get something soft and comfortable
02-12-2018T00:42:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"Make sure to include “regular”, “petite”, “boot cut”, “long”, etc"
02-12-2018T00:42:53,Bgrmystr2,"a woman in a suit and tie looks business as fuck, yo."
02-12-2018T00:43:06,Bgrmystr2,they can look just as good as guys do
02-12-2018T00:43:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I do like me a good suit
02-12-2018T00:43:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Like to get one some day
02-12-2018T00:43:34,Vatruvius,"I do understand cut, I have spent far too much time figuring out what cut jeans fit me best."
02-12-2018T00:43:35,SpazztasticKiwi,But women’s tuxes are often “sexyfied”
02-12-2018T00:43:51,Bgrmystr2,lol yeah that happens..
02-12-2018T00:43:52,Vatruvius,Ugh...of course they are.
02-12-2018T00:43:56,Vatruvius,:P
02-12-2018T00:44:00,Bgrmystr2,everything else
02-12-2018T00:44:06,Bgrmystr2,"cuz it ""needs sex appeal"""
02-12-2018T00:44:07,Vatruvius,That was not meant to be a happy sticking out tongue...
02-12-2018T00:44:13,SpazztasticKiwi,If I want to show mah boobs I’ll wear a low cut thanks
02-12-2018T00:44:53,Bgrmystr2,like.. wtf? Why does it need sex appeal? It's a woman in a damned business suit. That view of command is sex appeal to begin with. WHat more do you need?
02-12-2018T00:45:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I e come across people who prefer to look at the chest rather than the eyes of a woman
02-12-2018T00:45:56,Vatruvius,Because women can not last a day in the business world and must use their sex to do so Bgr...duh!
02-12-2018T00:46:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Still don’t help them concentrate
02-12-2018T00:46:08,Vatruvius,"I do not support the view I just stated, all sarcasm."
02-12-2018T00:46:16,Bgrmystr2,"well, you can't really blame guys for being interested in something they'll never understand because they don't have a pair for themselves."
02-12-2018T00:46:32,Bgrmystr2,lol vatru
02-12-2018T00:46:34,Bgrmystr2,xD
02-12-2018T00:46:59,Vatruvius,"I have to state it, too much of a controversial statement for me not to make my sarcasm clear."
02-12-2018T00:47:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Thing I don’t understand is how some seem to thing certain jokes are ok openers or topics in general to start off with a woman they’ve just met
02-12-2018T00:47:48,Bgrmystr2,"I understand that some women want to use sex appeal, but it's honestly not really needed.. :/"
02-12-2018T00:48:09,Vatruvius,Like what?
02-12-2018T00:48:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Example is the most recent guy that I mentioned alot that had joined us at work
02-12-2018T00:48:19,Bgrmystr2,"lol, a joke is either okay or isn't okay, imo."
02-12-2018T00:48:37,Bgrmystr2,it's just a matter of whether the person knows you mean nothing bad from it
02-12-2018T00:50:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d known the guy for like
02-12-2018T00:51:00,SpazztasticKiwi,A week
02-12-2018T00:51:43,Vatruvius,"Well, what was the jok or subject?"
02-12-2018T00:51:46,Vatruvius,joke*
02-12-2018T00:52:13,Vatruvius,"Wait, I think I vaguely remember you talking about this guy and me being appalled about what he did."
02-12-2018T00:52:26,SpazztasticKiwi,We cook corn dogs in the deli. I’d cooked some but one got missed and I didn’t get it out of the fryer until much later
02-12-2018T00:52:32,SpazztasticKiwi,It was Black and hard
02-12-2018T00:52:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Guess the joke buddy
02-12-2018T00:52:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Guess
02-12-2018T00:53:50,Vatruvius,"I have a innocent mind, I am drawing a blank..."
02-12-2018T00:53:57,Bgrmystr2,welp.
02-12-2018T00:53:57,Vatruvius,Wait...nooooooo....
02-12-2018T00:54:12,Bgrmystr2,that went south.
02-12-2018T00:55:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh
02-12-2018T00:55:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Wanna know his words?
02-12-2018T00:55:37,SpazztasticKiwi,“That looks like..” *looks at own crotch*
02-12-2018T00:55:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"Manager, can I go home?"
02-12-2018T00:56:34,Vatruvius,Uh...
02-12-2018T00:56:57,Vatruvius,"My response....""Really, I thought it would be bigger."""
02-12-2018T00:57:12,Vatruvius,What an ass.
02-12-2018T00:57:59,SpazztasticKiwi,My first response was to slap him
02-12-2018T00:58:14,SpazztasticKiwi,But my hands were full and I was juuust out of reach
02-12-2018T00:58:30,SpazztasticKiwi,And I would’ve been fired
02-12-2018T00:58:38,Bgrmystr2,"I expected more of a fun joke, but that's not even a fucking good one"
02-12-2018T00:59:21,Vatruvius,"No, that is more of a ""trying to get into your pants"" attempt thinking all girls would just want sex."
02-12-2018T00:59:41,Bgrmystr2,"I'm not seeing it, but okay"
02-12-2018T01:00:29,Vatruvius,"I mean, it is text so it really is a ""had to have been there"" to know for sure since our communication goes way beyond just words."
02-12-2018T01:01:02,Bgrmystr2,considering I'm a guy and most of the time.. male communication is literally just words..
02-12-2018T01:01:06,Vatruvius,"For instance, his body language and facial expression."
02-12-2018T01:01:07,Bgrmystr2,I dunno?
02-12-2018T01:01:33,Bgrmystr2,probably was one of those I had to be there
02-12-2018T01:01:38,Vatruvius,"Oh, between guys yeah it is for the most part just words. But I have seen guys try to do more when talking to girls."
02-12-2018T01:02:12,Bgrmystr2,likely because girls have this whole.. communication bs that isn't words.
02-12-2018T01:02:16,Bgrmystr2,and guys try and fail
02-12-2018T01:02:19,Bgrmystr2,that's what that is.
02-12-2018T01:03:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"All I can really say is generally from then on, I didn’t give him my back"
02-12-2018T01:03:23,Vatruvius,Yeah...
02-12-2018T01:04:13,Vatruvius,"Not that many would look most likely, but have you tried getting a fake wedding ring or something to keep guys from doing stuff like that?"
02-12-2018T01:04:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Yes
02-12-2018T01:04:33,Bgrmystr2,that doesn't help lol
02-12-2018T01:04:45,Bgrmystr2,"if a guy is gonna be like that, he's not gonna care about a wedding ring."
02-12-2018T01:04:53,Vatruvius,"No, as I said probably would not be that successful but who knows."
02-12-2018T01:05:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"If anything, I’m married as far as anyone is concerned if they get pushy regardless"
02-12-2018T01:05:25,Bgrmystr2,doesn't hurt to try of course
02-12-2018T01:05:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I can always tell them I don’t wear my ring because I don’t want to drop it in the sink
02-12-2018T01:06:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve pulled the “I’m married” card before
02-12-2018T01:07:21,SpazztasticKiwi,His name is Jace. And he owns his own business
02-12-2018T01:07:38,SpazztasticKiwi,But he sometimes travels
02-12-2018T01:07:40,Vatruvius,"It really pisses me off guys act that way, but it is also likely that because they think that way I never have many guy friends...never get past the first interaction."
02-12-2018T01:08:13,Vatruvius,"The only time I had so much fun with so many guys was at this huge scholarship thing from doing community service. Everyone there were nice, honest people."
02-12-2018T01:08:36,SpazztasticKiwi,And he doesn’t like cameras so I don’t have pictures. But he has long hair
02-12-2018T01:08:58,Vatruvius,Because he doesn't want it going around that this guy is terrible?
02-12-2018T01:09:02,Vatruvius,Avoid at all costs?
02-12-2018T01:09:28,SpazztasticKiwi,That was more description of my “husband”
02-12-2018T01:09:56,Vatruvius,I see...
02-12-2018T01:10:03,Vatruvius,That works.
02-12-2018T01:10:56,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s also not a big talker - real quiet
02-12-2018T01:11:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"(If you can’t tell, he’s based on someone)"
02-12-2018T01:11:42,Vatruvius,I am clueless so...
02-12-2018T01:11:45,Vatruvius,I think...
02-12-2018T01:12:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Lived near a lake before he met me
02-12-2018T01:13:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Average height but wide shoulders
02-12-2018T01:13:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Rather muscular
02-12-2018T01:13:42,Vatruvius,"I really have no idea who this ""husband"" is based off of. Either I know it and am just not seeing it or I never heard or seen this individual."
02-12-2018T01:14:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Anyone got a guess
02-12-2018T01:14:09,SpazztasticKiwi,?
02-12-2018T01:15:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Jason Voorheese
02-12-2018T01:15:18,Vatruvius,lol
02-12-2018T01:15:33,Vatruvius,"I was going to say Keanu Reeves, just for the hell of it."
02-12-2018T01:16:01,Vatruvius,Jason does not have long hair I do not think...
02-12-2018T01:16:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"Before he became undead, he had shoulder length brownish hair"
02-12-2018T01:17:16,SpazztasticKiwi,You can see it in Friday the 13th one or two
02-12-2018T01:17:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Think it’s the first one
02-12-2018T01:17:29,Vatruvius,"I never watched the film, game is fun though."
02-12-2018T01:19:02,Bgrmystr2,"never cared about any of that, so the reference is lost on me"
02-12-2018T01:19:11,Bgrmystr2,"I know who the guy is, just dunno the last name and never cared :U"
02-12-2018T01:19:16,Vatruvius,"See, John Wick would have been better."
02-12-2018T01:19:33,Bgrmystr2,ohgod I wanna see that
02-12-2018T01:19:42,Bgrmystr2,I haven't seen it yet but it's on my list of movies
02-12-2018T01:19:54,Vatruvius,I saw the second one...was pretty good and actiony.
02-12-2018T01:22:08,Dadrobit,First one was great. Second was pretty good.
02-12-2018T01:22:55,Vatruvius,I only watched the second one because it was on Amazon Prime for a short while.
02-12-2018T01:23:02,Vatruvius,First one was still rent.
02-12-2018T01:27:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"I wonder if I’ll ever have to use my elaborate description. So far, acting desperately uninterested has worked"
02-12-2018T01:27:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"For me, it’s been something fun to come up with"
02-12-2018T01:27:40,Vatruvius,I bet.
02-12-2018T01:27:48,Vatruvius,"Still, shouldn't be necessary."
02-12-2018T01:28:00,Vatruvius,it shouldn't*
02-12-2018T01:28:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I am looking for a fake ring. I’ll sometimes wear one of my fashion rings; looks similar to an engagement ring
02-12-2018T01:28:55,SpazztasticKiwi,But acting boring is working so far
02-12-2018T01:29:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Mostly
02-12-2018T01:30:04,Dadrobit,"Or, ya know. You coooouuuuuld just tel them, ""No."""
02-12-2018T01:31:39,Vatruvius,Somehow I doubt that would work.
02-12-2018T01:32:37,Bgrmystr2,"for most, it would"
02-12-2018T01:32:49,Dadrobit,"Worked pretty well for me. Got hit on and goosed a bunch when I was in security. ""No"" worked really well honestly."
02-12-2018T01:33:18,Bgrmystr2,"""No"" works for most guys, cuz most guys you can expect to be reasonable to some degree."
02-12-2018T01:33:32,Bgrmystr2,"if they're not, and ""no"" doesn't work, then *NOTHING* will work."
02-12-2018T01:33:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"Problem is, most of them don’t ask"
02-12-2018T01:33:55,SpazztasticKiwi,They just keep pestering you with questions and questions and questions
02-12-2018T01:34:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"And if they do ask for a number and you refuse, they want an excuse"
02-12-2018T01:34:33,Bgrmystr2,"you don't need an excuse, he's just some dude looking for a number he doesn't need"
02-12-2018T01:34:35,Bgrmystr2,gtfo
02-12-2018T01:35:22,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s the problem. “Not interested” and “no” don’t exist in some of these guys’ vocabularies
02-12-2018T01:36:10,Bgrmystr2,nothing will
02-12-2018T01:36:14,Bgrmystr2,they won't stop
02-12-2018T01:36:27,Bgrmystr2,they'll just drop you and go onto to the next girl they see
02-12-2018T01:36:53,Dadrobit,So tell them you're going to get a manager/security if they're legitimately that bad?
02-12-2018T01:37:39,SpazztasticKiwi,You know I’m not just talking about at work right - and yea I’ll resort to getting help if need be
02-12-2018T01:37:43,Vatruvius,That would depend on the manager.
02-12-2018T01:38:03,SpazztasticKiwi,But if they manage to corner you or get violent or aggressive...#ohshit
02-12-2018T01:38:22,Vatruvius,Pepper spray?
02-12-2018T01:38:32,Vatruvius,Taser?
02-12-2018T01:38:32,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s why I got it yea
02-12-2018T01:44:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Just never you mind about it - somethin I consider as with life. Go about your regularly scheduled chat.
02-12-2018T01:44:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I got 12 pages of vocabulary to sort and practice
02-12-2018T01:45:22,Vatruvius,"Why so much, for what?"
02-12-2018T01:45:48,SpazztasticKiwi,German
02-12-2018T01:46:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Been trying to get them all copied for all-together review
02-12-2018T01:46:51,Vatruvius,"Ohh...I took German in high school. Was pretty fun, if you need practice I am all for chatting auf Deutsch."
02-12-2018T01:46:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Spelling and translations and categorizeing parts of speech
02-12-2018T01:47:01,Vatruvius,"Though, I am going to have to do some radical catching up."
02-12-2018T01:47:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve technically been doing lessons every day for the past 203 days in a row
02-12-2018T01:47:46,Vatruvius,That is pretty good.
02-12-2018T01:48:09,SpazztasticKiwi,But I’ve been wanting to get all the words I’ve learned together for at-hand
02-12-2018T01:48:26,SpazztasticKiwi,See the relationships better
02-12-2018T01:49:23,Vatruvius,"That is a good idea. Have you been practicing the...I keep forgetting the word for it...the gender for each word: masculine, feminine, neutral?"
02-12-2018T01:49:24,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s for fun as a side thing but I waste time if I don’t find some way to put it How I really learn
02-12-2018T01:49:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah
02-12-2018T01:49:52,Vatruvius,Have you put sticky notes of the words on the objects in your house?
02-12-2018T01:50:19,SpazztasticKiwi,No. I’ve just today found the word list - I’m in Mark’s Duolingo group
02-12-2018T01:50:39,Vatruvius,He has a Duolingo group?
02-12-2018T01:50:58,SpazztasticKiwi,The app doesn’t show access to the “words learned” list. So I used my laptop and copied them all don into Word
02-12-2018T01:51:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Yep
02-12-2018T01:51:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m apparently one of the only about two or three active
02-12-2018T01:51:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Good news with that is I’m basically always #1 in group
02-12-2018T01:51:54,Vatruvius,lol
02-12-2018T01:52:08,Vatruvius,I have a Duolingo so I could relearn the
02-12-2018T01:52:18,Vatruvius,German I forgotten which is most of it.
02-12-2018T01:52:33,Vatruvius,Haven't been using it...ever really.
02-12-2018T01:52:47,SpazztasticKiwi,He posted the code/link thing awhile ago and it took me while to “Why not” and see if there was an open spot
02-12-2018T01:53:16,Vatruvius,"Why did I never hear of it, I watch every single one of his videos."
02-12-2018T01:53:42,SpazztasticKiwi,It was about last year. If I remember right the code is on his Facebook page
02-12-2018T01:53:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"I may still have it, dunno"
02-12-2018T01:54:15,SpazztasticKiwi,But there’s no guarantee of an open spot
02-12-2018T01:55:26,Vatruvius,"Eh, it is alright."
02-12-2018T01:55:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"And I’ve yet to find Mark checking in, let alone studying. He’s really buckled down with Korean first instead - best for concentration"
02-12-2018T01:55:43,SpazztasticKiwi,he says
02-12-2018T01:55:57,Vatruvius,I joined Duolingo just because it was free. Was never aware they had groups if groups was even a feature when I joined years ago.
02-12-2018T01:56:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m there cause it’s open. I’ve been ok studying on my own so far
02-12-2018T01:56:24,Vatruvius,"You do need to concentrate with a language, doing two is really hard. One is hard enough."
02-12-2018T01:57:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"Theoretically, I could add Spanish and get back on it. Took two years in high school"
02-12-2018T01:58:11,SpazztasticKiwi,But not now. Maybe once I get my notes for German settled and a separate notebook for the Spanish
02-12-2018T01:58:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Organize and prioritize and study
02-12-2018T01:59:07,CrimsonQuill,Morning guys
02-12-2018T01:59:19,Vatruvius,Night Crimson
02-12-2018T01:59:25,CrimsonQuill,time zones
02-12-2018T01:59:29,Vatruvius,Yeah...
02-12-2018T01:59:38,CrimsonQuill,I only want to ask one thing.
02-12-2018T01:59:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t see how learning German will help since I don’t plan to ever travel to German areas or teach it or anything. But the Spanish could help
02-12-2018T02:00:12,CrimsonQuill,Please tell me that Tom only did one colour of my sketch-I don't want to have caused him too much work.
02-12-2018T02:00:14,Vatruvius,It also could be just for fun. You would be surprised how many people you would run into that know German.
02-12-2018T02:00:26,CrimsonQuill,"Also, i'm terrible at languages"
02-12-2018T02:00:37,Vatruvius,"Only one i believe Crimson, wolfRaine."
02-12-2018T02:00:41,Vatruvius,I*
02-12-2018T02:00:49,SpazztasticKiwi,And it seems knowing separate languages alerts radars for jobs
02-12-2018T02:00:52,Bgrmystr2,"Quill, if he did the other version, then it was his decision to do so"
02-12-2018T02:00:56,Bgrmystr2,and you shouldn't worry about it
02-12-2018T02:01:11,CrimsonQuill,I just feel a bit guilty at asking so much.
02-12-2018T02:01:25,Bgrmystr2,"we don't know, and it doesn't really matter. If he does it, he does it, if he doesn't, then he doesn't."
02-12-2018T02:01:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"No matter what different languages they are, you come out to be more useful"
02-12-2018T02:01:31,CrimsonQuill,"True, that."
02-12-2018T02:01:37,Bgrmystr2,we'll find out.
02-12-2018T02:01:41,CrimsonQuill,we will.
02-12-2018T02:01:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m gonna brushie the teeth and see about going to bed soon
02-12-2018T02:02:04,CrimsonQuill,"But now, I need to find out how much porridge I'm going to have for breakfast."
02-12-2018T02:03:42,CrimsonQuill,Cheerio!
02-12-2018T02:03:47,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-greetings:
02-12-2018T02:03:56,Vatruvius,Bye!
02-12-2018T02:04:11,Vatruvius,I just derped so much...oh God why!
02-12-2018T02:05:06,Bgrmystr2,what did you do?
02-12-2018T02:05:43,Vatruvius,"In my Java program I have many arrays going on, instead of doing just 1 for loop I did a for loop for each array and realized I could have done it with just one..."
02-12-2018T02:08:16,Bgrmystr2,uh... I sorta understand? I think?
02-12-2018T02:08:35,Vatruvius,"Basically, I made a way more complicated than it had to be."
02-12-2018T02:11:51,Bgrmystr2,yeah I got that
02-12-2018T02:12:20,Vatruvius,"Making that change, I have reduced 50+ lines of code into 15 lines."
02-12-2018T02:12:31,DarthRexKing,Goodnight!
02-12-2018T02:12:38,Vatruvius,Goodnight Drex.
02-12-2018T02:12:50,Bgrmystr2,night Drex
02-12-2018T02:13:32,DarthRexKing,"I rather be called Darth Rex, but whatever. Later."

02-12-2018T02:15:08,Bgrmystr2,why though? Aren't you going to sleep?
02-12-2018T02:15:31,DarthRexKing,"I am, but now I have a need for burning things on a stick!"
02-12-2018T02:15:41,DarthRexKing,Burn them all! I will dream of that. Good day.

02-12-2018T02:17:49,Vatruvius,But why?
02-12-2018T02:18:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Seemingly unprompted burning of everything
02-12-2018T02:21:30,Vatruvius,I did it again!
02-12-2018T02:22:07,Bgrmystr2,"rofl I agree with your subtle link statement, Kiwi"
02-12-2018T02:25:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m out
02-12-2018T02:25:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Night everyone
02-12-2018T02:25:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Night Tom
02-12-2018T02:25:36,Vatruvius,Goodnight Kiwi.
02-12-2018T02:27:33,Bgrmystr2,gnight kiwi
02-12-2018T02:34:47,Vatruvius,Of course this would have to be tedious.
02-12-2018T02:35:49,Vatruvius,"All the coding is done and working, woohoo! What's that? I have to format all the information in neatly aligned columns with units..."
02-12-2018T02:35:59,Vatruvius,:ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:
02-12-2018T02:46:05,Bgrmystr2,lol sounds like fun
02-12-2018T02:49:06,Vatruvius,"It kinda is, when it is all done. But formatting everything is really time consuming. Coding is more fun then setting up the results to be readable."
02-12-2018T02:49:35,Vatruvius,I spend just as much time as I do coding when formatting the outputs. Depending on the code and the outputs.
02-12-2018T02:49:50,Bgrmystr2,"lol,"
02-12-2018T02:49:56,Bgrmystr2,sounds about right for anything else
02-12-2018T02:50:07,Bgrmystr2,always somethin fun.. then making it look nice or be more efficient.. not always fun
02-12-2018T02:50:25,Bgrmystr2,gonna brb a little
02-12-2018T04:05:56,Vatruvius,OMG
02-12-2018T04:06:01,Vatruvius,Really!
02-12-2018T05:01:48,Vatruvius,"Alright, I am heading to bed. Goodnight everyone! :ctwokinds-RainezZz:"
02-12-2018T05:01:54,Bgrmystr2,gnight
02-12-2018T05:01:56,Bgrmystr2,also back
02-12-2018T06:22:58,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
02-12-2018T06:44:58,TerraTheWizard,"nice, by accident i figured out how to get the picarto vods to play in full size in window"
02-12-2018T06:52:36,TerraTheWizard,"opening them in a new tab uses the popout player, so you get the proper full size"
02-12-2018T06:58:40,Bgrmystr2,you didn't  do that before..?
02-12-2018T06:59:36,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: I wasn't sure why anyone would watch it any other way
02-12-2018T06:59:42,Bgrmystr2,since mobile doesn't count since it's mobile
02-12-2018T07:01:44,TerraTheWizard,it used to do it by default
02-12-2018T07:01:51,TerraTheWizard,then they changed it to the embedded player
02-12-2018T07:02:03,TerraTheWizard,so i've been using fullscreen
02-12-2018T07:02:44,TerraTheWizard,then i accidentally middle clicked the vod just now
02-12-2018T07:02:47,TerraTheWizard,and tada
02-12-2018T07:03:51,Bgrmystr2,I swapped my middle click to the thumb button on the mouse and use that to open most every link in my browser
02-12-2018T07:04:18,Bgrmystr2,"get a new tab every time, I get the page itself and it doesn't force me to leave the page I'm on and lose w/e I'm working on"

02-12-2018T10:47:41,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-rainehappy: hi tom
02-12-2018T10:49:16,Twokinds,I'm going to work on the next comic page.
02-12-2018T10:52:20,BadFoMo,On or off camera?
02-12-2018T10:52:37,Twokinds,I don't know.
02-12-2018T10:52:42,BadFoMo,Ok.
02-12-2018T10:57:22,iliar,I have long wanted to ask. How far ahead do you think about the plot of the comic?
02-12-2018T10:58:36,Twokinds,The overarching story is plotted out. The details of what happens in each chapter is done chapter-by-chapter.
02-12-2018T11:03:03,iliar,Hm Chapter 19 started in November 2016 and ended in April 2018. So you are creating a storyline more than a year in advance. I am impressed.
02-12-2018T11:04:04,Twokinds,lol
02-12-2018T11:04:11,Twokinds,It's more than it just takes me a long time to tell it
02-12-2018T11:08:16,Twokinds,That's why I'm slowly programming Alexa to be my personal assistant. So I can keep better track of time.
02-12-2018T11:14:17,TerraTheWizard,programming your own robot overlord
02-12-2018T11:22:53,Twokinds,Just embracing the inevitable!

02-12-2018T12:31:31,Xexanoth,more opossums? XD
02-12-2018T12:32:12,Twokinds,Seems Tumblr has decided they want to go down in flames.
02-12-2018T12:32:49,Xexanoth,what did they do?
02-12-2018T12:34:00,Twokinds,"Apparently, they announced they'll be banning all adult content Dec 17."
02-12-2018T12:34:17,TerraTheWizard,hwut
02-12-2018T12:34:39,Twokinds,"I don't use Tumblr at all, but I feel like that's not a good idea."
02-12-2018T12:35:46,TerraTheWizard,just checked the staff feed
02-12-2018T12:35:58,TerraTheWizard,seems they have totally given up on the war against the bots
02-12-2018T12:37:55,TerraTheWizard,seriously reading their message
02-12-2018T12:38:12,TerraTheWizard,"the reason they seem to be citing is ""we hate child porn so we're banning all nsfw"""
02-12-2018T12:38:51,TerraTheWizard,https://staff.tumblr.com/post/180758987165/a-better-more-positive-tumblr
02-12-2018T12:41:12,Twokinds,I'm honestly worries more sites will start to follow suit as the 'professional' side of the web tries to become more sanitized.
02-12-2018T12:41:40,Twokinds,Patreon feels like it's trying to go the same way.
02-12-2018T12:45:50,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s no longer available on apple store
02-12-2018T12:46:01,TerraTheWizard,that happened a month back
02-12-2018T12:46:17,SpazztasticKiwi,But yeah. They announced the change awhile ago
02-12-2018T12:46:30,TerraTheWizard,and half the artists i follow decided they'd jump ship to twitter
02-12-2018T12:46:39,TerraTheWizard,twitter is the worst platform for sharing art
02-12-2018T12:46:41,TerraTheWizard,good lord
02-12-2018T12:46:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Main problem I had with tumblr was bits following me

02-12-2018T12:47:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"And for awhile, bots were absolutely infesting Ethan’s tumblr tags"
02-12-2018T12:47:57,TerraTheWizard,they added account reporting a year or 2 back
02-12-2018T12:48:00,TerraTheWizard,& it didn't help
02-12-2018T12:48:37,TerraTheWizard,"seriously, artisis need to not just only exist on twitter, fuuuuu"
02-12-2018T12:48:48,SpazztasticKiwi,So looking up #crankgameplays was not always all-ages friendly
02-12-2018T12:48:54,SpazztasticKiwi,If you know what I mean
02-12-2018T12:48:56,TerraTheWizard,i don't need to hear about your sandwich & what you did yesterday
02-12-2018T12:49:07,TerraTheWizard,and there's no gallery
02-12-2018T12:49:14,TerraTheWizard,how do i look at your art without a gallery aaaaa
02-12-2018T12:49:42,TerraTheWizard,miss a tweet? may as well have never existed
02-12-2018T12:50:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"If they could implement an age gate - blocking accounts with dob under the legal age, that would help with artists"
02-12-2018T12:50:34,SpazztasticKiwi,But their aim is destroying all the pedo stuff so
02-12-2018T12:51:11,SpazztasticKiwi,And if their algorithm is missing stuff...
02-12-2018T12:52:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Could be a case of making a smarter or updated algorithm or scanner
02-12-2018T12:53:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"Were you thinking of making a tumblr, Tom?"
02-12-2018T12:56:29,Twokinds,lol no
02-12-2018T12:56:59,Twokinds,"I do not like that Tumblr doesn't have comments, or any way to easily browse old stuff."
02-12-2018T12:57:24,Twokinds,Honestly it's always baffled me why people liked it so much.
02-12-2018T12:57:58,Twokinds,"Reading people react to stuff is half the fun of online posts, for me."
02-12-2018T12:59:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"I generally just like or reblog with my two cents, and it’s not terribly often"
02-12-2018T12:59:43,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s good for a laugh when you follow certain people
02-12-2018T13:00:22,Twokinds,"What's the point of the little dropdown, where you can scroll through the name of every person who ever liked something, one at a time?"
02-12-2018T13:01:14,Twokinds,Seems useless.
02-12-2018T13:01:19,TerraTheWizard,they added comments at some point recently
02-12-2018T13:01:25,TerraTheWizard,they're still pretty useless though
02-12-2018T13:01:57,TerraTheWizard,they never announced them so onlu like 1% of users know they exist
02-12-2018T13:04:54,SpazztasticKiwi,You can use that drop down to get info on the post. Maybe someone dropped a link or info dump
02-12-2018T13:05:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"Cause on mobile, you can see reblogs and such with that same thing"
02-12-2018T13:05:56,TerraTheWizard,"yeah, you click on the notes and it has a ""comment"" box now"
02-12-2018T13:06:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"But anyway, I’ll be back later. Work time"
02-12-2018T13:06:05,TerraTheWizard,with the likes & reblogs
02-12-2018T13:07:20,Twokinds,So glad it's monday
02-12-2018T13:12:22,Xexanoth,you're like anti garfield
02-12-2018T13:13:14,TerraTheWizard,lol
02-12-2018T13:23:37,CrimsonQuill,Hullo Tom.
02-12-2018T13:25:14,CrimsonQuill,"Guys, in this case I'm half Garfield for Monday."
02-12-2018T13:25:23,CrimsonQuill,But Half Tom in attitude
02-12-2018T13:25:29,CrimsonQuill,I've had a mixed bag
02-12-2018T13:33:59,Mippy,Hellos everyone
02-12-2018T13:34:17,CrimsonQuill,hullo Mippy
02-12-2018T13:34:26,Mippy,"Crimson, COD Rose turned out great"
02-12-2018T13:35:13,Mippy,Congrats buddy. Sorry I was a lots pissy yesterday
02-12-2018T13:35:15,CrimsonQuill,"You mean Halo Raine, but that's good."
02-12-2018T13:35:27,CrimsonQuill,"@Mippy Honestly, I didn't really notice."
02-12-2018T13:35:38,CrimsonQuill,I was too worried about whetherI was loading Tom with work.
02-12-2018T13:36:34,Mippy,I kind of “switch” when the meds are not working so well.
02-12-2018T13:36:50,Mippy,Tom’s always got lots of work...
02-12-2018T13:37:02,CrimsonQuill,Hehheh...
02-12-2018T13:37:47,CrimsonQuill,I spent half my day in boots that were too small and giving me blisters.
02-12-2018T13:38:06,CrimsonQuill,And the other half making beef pastries.
02-12-2018T13:38:17,Mippy,Ouch! I built my first stretcher frame :ctwokinds-rainehappy:
02-12-2018T13:38:25,CrimsonQuill,Nice.
02-12-2018T13:38:46,Mippy,Yum! Beef pastries. Ugh! I want to make some meat pies now
02-12-2018T13:38:57,CrimsonQuill,They were called Cheubreks.
02-12-2018T13:39:07,CrimsonQuill,A slavic dish.
02-12-2018T13:39:28,Mippy,Chooo-breaks :ctwokinds-floraquestion: I’d eat it.
02-12-2018T13:39:32,CrimsonQuill,"Basically, a pastry parcel around beef and onion deep fried in a saucepan."
02-12-2018T13:39:58,CrimsonQuill,"I can link the recipe if needs be, though they are reather...time consuming to cook."
02-12-2018T13:40:04,Mippy,"Ok, now I’d definitely eat it."
02-12-2018T13:40:13,CrimsonQuill,rather
02-12-2018T13:40:38,CrimsonQuill,"Chebureki, not Cheubrek"
02-12-2018T13:40:38,Mippy,I don’t have a lot of time this week but  Holiday break is coming up
02-12-2018T13:40:42,CrimsonQuill,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9NEXPoepO4&t=320s
02-12-2018T13:40:56,CrimsonQuill,"Hah, well, I have my stuff."
02-12-2018T13:41:05,CrimsonQuill,Work and more work.
02-12-2018T13:41:37,Mippy,"Thanks, I’ll take a look when I have time. Cooking with Boris. Sounds nice"
02-12-2018T13:41:46,CrimsonQuill,Absolutely hilarious
02-12-2018T13:41:54,CrimsonQuill,And very useful
02-12-2018T13:42:02,CrimsonQuill,If you want a Chebureki
02-12-2018T13:42:19,Mippy,Funny and informative....sounds like a great time.
02-12-2018T13:42:32,CrimsonQuill,I cooked 10.
02-12-2018T13:42:35,CrimsonQuill,Ate 2.
02-12-2018T13:42:47,CrimsonQuill,And now my stomach feels like it will explode.
02-12-2018T13:42:55,CrimsonQuill,Worth it
02-12-2018T13:43:06,Mippy,Dang! Left overs! Or food for house mates to steal.
02-12-2018T13:43:34,CrimsonQuill,"No leftovers for me. Either everything is eaten, or everything is eaten."
02-12-2018T13:43:47,Mippy,I don’t really know any Slavic recipes because my family isn’t Slavic. This will be fun.
02-12-2018T13:44:05,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I only learned about Life of Boris from my sister."
02-12-2018T13:44:21,CrimsonQuill,"And I'm no Slav either, I just decided to give it a go."
02-12-2018T13:44:35,CrimsonQuill,I'm more capable with Bacon and Cabbage
02-12-2018T13:44:36,CrimsonQuill,.
02-12-2018T13:45:14,Mippy,Nothing wrong with Bacon and Cabbage. You hit my Irish side with that one.
02-12-2018T13:45:40,Mippy,Could eat a bowl of that stuff
02-12-2018T13:45:43,CrimsonQuill,"Ha, well my aunt taught me how to make it."
02-12-2018T13:45:59,CrimsonQuill,"And oh, the sweetness of the meal..."
02-12-2018T13:46:09,CrimsonQuill,"WITH POTATOES, of course."
02-12-2018T13:46:25,Mippy,We often have it with Cornbeef and hash on the side
02-12-2018T13:46:44,Mippy,That’s good tuck that is
02-12-2018T13:46:49,CrimsonQuill,"Indeed,"
02-12-2018T13:47:13,CrimsonQuill,"Oh crumbs. My stomach is full, but all this talking about food is making me hungry."
02-12-2018T13:47:25,CrimsonQuill,Figures....
02-12-2018T13:47:44,Mippy,I’ve got lunch right in front of me...so I’m good
02-12-2018T13:48:20,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I had two pieces of chocolate biscuit cake after my chebrekis...so all I want now is water and Camomile tea."
02-12-2018T13:48:59,CrimsonQuill,"By the way, i actually have an entire Halo-related backstory in reference to my sketch suggestion."
02-12-2018T13:49:15,Mippy,That sounds filling. Now I’m drooling over the thought of chocolate biscuit cake.
02-12-2018T13:49:31,CrimsonQuill,I'm going to be linking it as a PDF or Drive document though. It'd be too long on the Patreon Comments.
02-12-2018T13:49:37,Mippy,:ctwokinds-karenOOO: backstory
02-12-2018T13:50:02,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I needed to have some reason why she was crash landed..."
02-12-2018T13:50:16,Mippy,Probably wouldn’t understand half of it since I don’t know Halo. XD
02-12-2018T13:50:52,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, Twokinds, Halo and Youtube are probably the defining interests for me right now"
02-12-2018T13:52:43,Mippy,My interest jumps all over the place. Last month it was Fantastic Beasts. This month I’m going through a Labyrinth thing. Twokinds is always sort of a over arching interest
02-12-2018T13:53:16,CrimsonQuill,"Labyrinth as in the David Bowie film, or something else?"
02-12-2018T13:53:32,Mippy,Yes! The David Bowie film
02-12-2018T13:54:23,CrimsonQuill,"My younger sister spotted a David Bowie tribute and Easter egg in the game West of Loathing, where you summon the skeleton of Dave B with a GLASS ORB, and the words, 'Dance magic Dance'."
02-12-2018T13:54:40,CrimsonQuill,I've watched it. It is rather good.
02-12-2018T13:54:44,Mippy,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
02-12-2018T13:55:08,Mippy,That reminds me... I have to finish Mark’s play of that
02-12-2018T13:55:31,CrimsonQuill,I finished it. Can't say I want to see anything spittoon related now.
02-12-2018T13:56:10,Mippy,Spittoons are absolutely disgusting...
02-12-2018T13:56:12,CrimsonQuill,"WHY SO MANY SPITTOONS, GAME?"
02-12-2018T13:56:29,CrimsonQuill,His reactions to them ARE rather funny though..
02-12-2018T13:56:41,Twokinds,SQUIRREL!
02-12-2018T13:56:50,CrimsonQuill,"WHERE?""!"
02-12-2018T13:56:51,Mippy,"Well, you have to spit somewhere...might as well spit in a sess pool of diseases"
02-12-2018T13:56:55,Mippy,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
02-12-2018T13:56:57,Twokinds,Near my window.
02-12-2018T13:57:06,CrimsonQuill,Which one? Red or Grey?
02-12-2018T13:57:23,Mippy,Awww.... squirrelly poo
02-12-2018T13:57:30,Twokinds,It's chittering a lot.
02-12-2018T13:57:43,CrimsonQuill,It must be a relative of Miss Nibbly's.
02-12-2018T13:58:01,Mippy,Share your food with it and it will be your friend for ever
02-12-2018T13:58:17,CrimsonQuill,Give the squirrel a nose boop.
02-12-2018T13:58:38,CrimsonQuill,"How was the stream by the way, Tom/"
02-12-2018T13:59:15,Twokinds,Fine
02-12-2018T13:59:29,CrimsonQuill,That's good.
02-12-2018T13:59:36,CrimsonQuill,I cooked Chebrekis
02-12-2018T14:01:45,Mippy,I have to go get my blood drawn again.
02-12-2018T14:02:05,CrimsonQuill,I'm not going to ask what that's about...
02-12-2018T14:02:16,CrimsonQuill,:ptv-scratch:
02-12-2018T14:03:18,Mippy,On going medical issues. This time it’s to check my iron levels. Make sure I’m not on the verge of death again. Then I have a ultrasound in January to check my insides
02-12-2018T14:04:04,CrimsonQuill,That's rough
02-12-2018T14:04:07,Mippy,Think I’ll go get pocked tomorrow before school
02-12-2018T14:05:13,Mippy,Oh Waite...
02-12-2018T14:05:43,Mippy,there is a lab here at the school. I could get poked here instead of the hospital
02-12-2018T14:06:18,CrimsonQuill,"Your decision, I don't know anything"
02-12-2018T14:06:42,Mippy,"Yeah, hehe"
02-12-2018T14:50:21,Mippy,Wow! Much quicker then the hospital. Poking is done. Now I have orange juice and carmal popcorn
02-12-2018T14:52:33,Mippy,And...I’m kind of dizzy :ctwokinds-katdryer:
02-12-2018T14:53:27,CrimsonQuill,That happen
02-12-2018T14:54:04,Mippy,"Crimson, my buddy, you still here"
02-12-2018T14:54:18,CrimsonQuill,Yes-IT'S ME
02-12-2018T14:54:51,Mippy,:ctwokinds-sleepoverA:
02-12-2018T14:56:15,CrimsonQuill,I am about to try Undertale again-one voss battle's really hitting me hard.
02-12-2018T14:56:57,Mippy,"Good luck, I haven’t even started Undertale. I’m a bad gamer."
02-12-2018T14:57:06,CrimsonQuill,I'm too much of one
02-12-2018T14:57:55,Mippy,"Hey, Tom, how about going to Fur-Eh! Some time? It’s the closest furry con too me."
02-12-2018T14:58:30,Mippy,Awwwe Crimson...gaming is a real world skil
02-12-2018T15:00:17,CrimsonQuill,I'm bad at it.
02-12-2018T15:00:20,CrimsonQuill,VERY BAD.
02-12-2018T15:01:09,NibblyBot,New Patreon Post: Tail Trapped https://www.patreon.com/posts/tail-trapped-23095775
02-12-2018T15:02:51,CrimsonQuill,Hmm... I notice the first colour pick has gone up before the last sketches have been posted...
02-12-2018T15:02:52,Mippy,"For me it depends on the type of game. I’m decent at platformers, puzzles, and action adventure/RPG types. Hopeless at FPS"
02-12-2018T15:03:41,Mippy,I like this one. I’m totally gonna be Trace when I get my fur suit
02-12-2018T15:03:59,CrimsonQuill,TOUCH STRIPEY TIGER TAIL
02-12-2018T15:04:43,Mippy,Just sleep with the tail all the time
02-12-2018T15:05:04,CrimsonQuill,I have a Speticeye Sam instead. It's a nice pillow.
02-12-2018T15:05:38,CrimsonQuill,"Septiceye, not Spepticeye. No matter how careful I am, I keep making these Typos."
02-12-2018T15:09:19,Twokinds,"If I wait until after all the sketches get posted, we'd be really behind"
02-12-2018T15:09:23,Twokinds,Better to just double them up.
02-12-2018T15:09:35,CrimsonQuill,Yeah-double the fun.
02-12-2018T15:09:49,CrimsonQuill,More entertainment for us...
02-12-2018T15:13:07,iliar,+ Nora Cards. We are waiting for a lot of content.
02-12-2018T15:13:22,CrimsonQuill,It'll be a busy week.
02-12-2018T15:16:21,Twokinds,yes those will be posted after the last Nov color on Friday
02-12-2018T15:16:28,Twokinds,I just finished scheduling them all out
02-12-2018T15:16:32,Twokinds,Phew takes a while
02-12-2018T15:16:56,CrimsonQuill,"I hope you'll give yourself a nice cuppa after that, Tom."

02-12-2018T15:21:41,iliar,About tea.
02-12-2018T15:22:38,iliar,"Tom, you somehow gave a link to instant coffee that you drink."
02-12-2018T15:22:45,Twokinds,Mmhm
02-12-2018T15:23:06,CrimsonQuill,I'm very partial to Earl Grey.
02-12-2018T15:23:23,CrimsonQuill,My parents like it too.
02-12-2018T15:23:38,Vatruvius,Hello! :ptv-greetings:
02-12-2018T15:23:39,iliar,I lost it. Can you give it again.
02-12-2018T15:23:52,CrimsonQuill,Hullo Vatruvius! :ptv-greetings:
02-12-2018T15:24:44,iliar,I am very interested to compare this coffee with the one that is sold in our stores.
02-12-2018T15:25:31,Vatruvius,I hate my DSL internet...downloading things take way too long. Already been over an hour and I am only a third of the way done.
02-12-2018T15:25:44,Vatruvius,Can't watch videos either because then the download will take longer.
02-12-2018T15:26:13,CrimsonQuill,You have my sympathise-I have to put up with the same.
02-12-2018T15:26:34,Vatruvius,"I am curious Tom, do you have an ending in mind for Twokinds or have you not thought that far ahead?"
02-12-2018T15:26:59,Twokinds,Ending?!
02-12-2018T15:27:08,Vatruvius,"No ending, got it..."
02-12-2018T15:27:11,Twokinds,lol yes
02-12-2018T15:27:15,Twokinds,There is an ending
02-12-2018T15:27:28,CrimsonQuill,I hope we don't see it for a long time.
02-12-2018T15:27:40,Vatruvius,"Good, because I would rather like to see Sam and Colin outside of sketches/colors."
02-12-2018T15:27:41,Vatruvius,XD
02-12-2018T15:27:42,Twokinds,Probably 5 years
02-12-2018T15:27:48,CrimsonQuill,"Because as far as I'm concerned, the comic is just getting started."
02-12-2018T15:28:01,CrimsonQuill,There's so much to explore!
02-12-2018T15:28:02,Vatruvius,"20 years, that is a long time."
02-12-2018T15:28:12,CrimsonQuill,"Wait, 5 years?"
02-12-2018T15:28:23,CrimsonQuill,How are you going to fit so much drama in 5 years?
02-12-2018T15:28:23,iliar,Hmm ... Only 5 years.
02-12-2018T15:28:40,Twokinds,"Yeah I think that's enough time. There will be more Twokinds projects, but I think it'll be nice to get a new start one day."
02-12-2018T15:29:02,Vatruvius,"By those numbers, we are in the last 500 pages of the comic already!"
02-12-2018T15:29:04,Twokinds,"I'd love to do SciFi honestly. lol But modern is good too, for Sam and Colin."
02-12-2018T15:29:31,CrimsonQuill,You'd make a really cool scifi world.
02-12-2018T15:29:45,iliar,I mean... I will be honest the plot develops very slowly.
02-12-2018T15:29:49,Vatruvius,"Well, I am working on SciFi so when I get started I will allow you to do sketches of my work...:ctwokinds-daydreamingkat:"
02-12-2018T15:30:29,iliar,I think 5 year not enough for ending with your speed.
02-12-2018T15:30:48,CrimsonQuill,"Five years, five long years. That's how long it took us to get Harvest back..."
02-12-2018T15:31:08,Vatruvius,I feel like five years is about right with a page a week.
02-12-2018T15:31:14,CrimsonQuill,I'm just chucking in a Halo Reference for the fun of it.
02-12-2018T15:31:38,Vatruvius,My Halo lore has been collecting too much dust...sorry.
02-12-2018T15:31:52,CrimsonQuill,Five years at a page a week...52-3 pages a year...that's just 260 pages left! Crumbs!
02-12-2018T15:32:15,CrimsonQuill,It's kind of wierd that I'm so worried about what's coming when i only started the comic this time last year.
02-12-2018T15:32:20,Vatruvius,"Something like that, yeah Crimson."
02-12-2018T15:32:49,Vatruvius,I wouldn't be too worried. Sam and Colin are in the works and who knows what else Tom has brewing.
02-12-2018T15:33:02,Vatruvius,"I mean, this is Tom's life so...likely to be plenty of content."
02-12-2018T15:33:02,Twokinds,"My plan is to hire another artist to help me out and work on smaller project. Sam and Colin is planned to just be one book, ~200 pages."
02-12-2018T15:33:38,iliar,"Page 852 (March 11, 2015) -> Page 978 (June 24, 2017) - Two years in real life and one day in comic time."
02-12-2018T15:33:43,Vatruvius,"Ohh, interesting. So are you shifting to mini-series or are you going to sprinkle them in with a larger project?"
02-12-2018T15:33:58,CrimsonQuill,"One of my favourite things about Twokinds is watching the art style grow and develop...page by page, chapter by chapter..."
02-12-2018T15:34:15,CrimsonQuill,"It shifts, it flows, it finally settles into something...unique."
02-12-2018T15:34:20,CrimsonQuill,A masterpiece.
02-12-2018T15:35:08,CrimsonQuill,"The best comics end up very differently to where they started-just look at Calvin and Hobbes in 1985, and then switch to 1995 when it finished."
02-12-2018T15:35:12,Vatruvius,I suppose the other artists will do the flats and inking?
02-12-2018T15:35:20,Vatruvius,That you would hire Tom...

02-12-2018T15:37:51,Twokinds,I'm not sure yet how work will be split up
02-12-2018T15:38:13,Vatruvius,I suppose it would depend on their skills and what you would like to work on.
02-12-2018T15:38:29,Twokinds,"But likely I will do the writing, designs, characters. They would be doing layout and art."
02-12-2018T15:38:53,Vatruvius,Do you like creating the story more than the drawing?

02-12-2018T15:49:07,Vatruvius,Do you ever work out how many pages a chapter might be Tom? Roughly speaking?
02-12-2018T15:49:27,Vatruvius,Or is that an afterthought?
02-12-2018T15:50:04,Twokinds,No absolutely not
02-12-2018T15:50:09,Twokinds,lol
02-12-2018T15:50:23,Twokinds,"Unfortunately, when I write a scene that takes 3 pages, it ends up taking 5"
02-12-2018T15:50:27,CrimsonQuill,Why would one constrain oneself like that?
02-12-2018T15:50:41,Twokinds,Just cause I think up more dialogue and stuff I could put in there.
02-12-2018T15:51:21,CrimsonQuill,"I'm just watching the recording of the colour stream from last night. Tom, Whadya mean 'It's All Canon' in regards to a certain Halfkind's multiversial travels?"
02-12-2018T15:51:24,Vatruvius,"I am not thinking in terms of constraint, rather just a thought like ""oh, these scene might be 7 pages and this one 3, etc."" Just a rough estimate to grasp but on constrain ones work."
02-12-2018T15:52:24,Vatruvius,"My typing is all over the place, too tired I suppose."
02-12-2018T15:53:15,Vatruvius,Wait...what Crimson?
02-12-2018T15:53:22,Vatruvius,What halfkind?
02-12-2018T15:53:27,CrimsonQuill,Raine of course.
02-12-2018T15:53:39,Vatruvius,Is Raine considered a halfkind?
02-12-2018T15:53:44,CrimsonQuill,I'm watching the colour stream from last night in the recording.
02-12-2018T15:53:52,CrimsonQuill,"And yes, she is a Halfkind."
02-12-2018T15:54:15,Vatruvius,"Right, but Tom already created a halfkind and Raine certainly is not it...well only when partially part of each."
02-12-2018T15:54:30,CrimsonQuill,I disagree.
02-12-2018T15:54:43,CrimsonQuill,It's not just a form-it's a state of being.
02-12-2018T15:55:02,CrimsonQuill,"As a Halfkind, Raine can either be Human, Keidran or Halfway in between."
02-12-2018T15:55:14,CrimsonQuill,If only her mum had actually taught her to control it...
02-12-2018T15:55:25,Vatruvius,But Tom created the Halfkinds comic...Raine does not fit the description unless that no longer applies which it very well could.
02-12-2018T15:55:41,CrimsonQuill,I just pay attention to the Twokinds comic.
02-12-2018T15:55:56,CrimsonQuill,"And I wouldn't think it applies, really, no."
02-12-2018T15:56:06,Vatruvius,"But Raine is not a halfkind, she processes the same ability her father has. That is not a type of being but a power."
02-12-2018T15:56:59,CrimsonQuill,"No, she is most certainly a halfkind-we just normally see her either fully Keidran or fully Human."
02-12-2018T15:57:24,CrimsonQuill,"That's the 'flawless transformation' mucking about with things,"
02-12-2018T15:57:25,Vatruvius,"Now Trace's and Flora's child, that would be considered a halfkind as they would be half human and half keidran, making them of two kinds thus the title of the comic I do believe."
02-12-2018T15:58:05,Vatruvius,"Raine does not qualify, it is the bending of the rules of Mekkan."
02-12-2018T15:59:06,Vatruvius,Care to chime in Tom?
02-12-2018T15:59:21,CrimsonQuill,"I respectfully disagree, and consider that Raine does qualify. Her father's natural form is a Keidran, and her mother is a human. While she may have been concieved with her father in human form, there is still Keidran in her. She is a Halfkind, with bits"
02-12-2018T15:59:26,CrimsonQuill,of both species
02-12-2018T16:00:08,Vatruvius,"But she is not, part of that power is a flawless transformation. Nothing in her is keidran."
02-12-2018T16:00:44,Vatruvius,She was conceptualized as a human. Her form is just a lack of control over the flawless transformation.
02-12-2018T16:00:46,CrimsonQuill,There is plenty of Keidran in her... I'm willing to bet Tom would agree.
02-12-2018T16:01:09,CrimsonQuill,I think he outright states it in the 'Raine Forms' picture he has on Deviantart.
02-12-2018T16:01:10,Vatruvius,"I attest...but Tom sets the rules. So, Tom?"
02-12-2018T16:03:29,Vatruvius,"But she is not half of a kind, she simply has half the form of another kind. That is all transformation, not something she was born with. If she was born that way and could not change her form then yes, she is a halfkind but she is not. It is all"
02-12-2018T16:03:31,Vatruvius,transformation.
02-12-2018T16:04:02,CrimsonQuill,"Again, evidence to the contrary."
02-12-2018T16:04:10,Vatruvius,You see what you have done Tom!?
02-12-2018T16:04:20,Vatruvius,"What evidence, there is zero evidence."
02-12-2018T16:04:36,CrimsonQuill,https://www.deviantart.com/twokinds/art/Raine-Forms-563597539
02-12-2018T16:04:37,Vatruvius,Just opinion and perception here.
02-12-2018T16:04:40,CrimsonQuill,Read the description
02-12-2018T16:06:39,Vatruvius,"In that very description her age is unchanged. That cannot be a result of being a halfkind. If she were her maximum age would be between the two species but her age is just like that of a humans, just how she was conceived."
02-12-2018T16:07:10,Vatruvius,Not to mention the annotation about such subjects throughout the comic.
02-12-2018T16:07:12,CrimsonQuill,I disagree again with that-the lifespan would be rather ling.
02-12-2018T16:07:20,Vatruvius,About the masks and their feelings of such issues.
02-12-2018T16:07:25,CrimsonQuill,I think we should just agree to disagree here.
02-12-2018T16:07:39,CrimsonQuill,Because I don't want to be here all night.
02-12-2018T16:07:54,CrimsonQuill,"Besides, I have Chapter 17 to read."
02-12-2018T16:08:48,Vatruvius,"I rest my case as being far more plausible. Neutral stated that a halfkind has never been allowed for a very long time. Upon her defeat at the hands of Trace, with some assistance, Neutral allowed the mixing of species. A true halfkind. Raine came before"
02-12-2018T16:08:54,Vatruvius,this and does not count. It is all magic.
02-12-2018T16:09:29,Vatruvius,"You enjoy this, don't you Tom?"
02-12-2018T16:09:52,CrimsonQuill,"I will rest my case, in my own opinion, as being plausible in itself-if Neutral had not allowed a mixing of the species anyhow, then surely Raine could not have been concieved."
02-12-2018T16:09:59,CrimsonQuill,But let's just leave it.
02-12-2018T16:10:15,CrimsonQuill,"I'd like to just get ready for bed, and read the comic."
02-12-2018T16:10:46,Vatruvius,"But, Neutral allowed it after, way after Raine's conception. That makes no sense."
02-12-2018T16:11:26,CrimsonQuill,Would it be possible for us to just leave it bit? I'd like to head to bed.
02-12-2018T16:11:45,CrimsonQuill,"Besides, I'm afraid I might turn a healthy debate into a warzone."
02-12-2018T16:11:54,CrimsonQuill,Being tired does that.
02-12-2018T16:12:12,Vatruvius,And conception with the Masks' approval or allowing does happen. With magic it is plausible as is with Raine's conception and Euchre's flawless transformation and the dragons' abilities to mate not depending species because they are magical creatures.
02-12-2018T16:12:28,Vatruvius,"Alright, fine."
02-12-2018T16:12:47,Vatruvius,without*
02-12-2018T16:12:52,CrimsonQuill,Because I don't think we'd ever agree unless Tom himself intervened.
02-12-2018T16:13:17,Vatruvius,Which does not look like is going to happen.
02-12-2018T16:13:38,CrimsonQuill,"Well, let's leave each other to our opinions. I'm off. Goodnight!"

02-12-2018T16:31:21,Twokinds,But it would be about a journey through space

02-12-2018T17:05:45,Vatruvius,Dependent?
02-12-2018T17:06:26,Azumachan,Flashbacks are the lazy way to tell something if they pop up with no reasons other than expositions. The story should naturally flows towards it.
02-12-2018T17:07:29,Vatruvius,It is not exposition. It is a clever way to tell the story. Purposely holding back bits of information to add tension that would reveal themselves in a flashback at an opportune moment.
02-12-2018T17:08:32,Vatruvius,"For example, you are following the protagonist in the present but discover their experiences that drive their motivations through flashbacks."
02-12-2018T17:09:03,Vatruvius,"As the present moves forward so do the flashbacks, kinda of like following the protagonist but in two timelines."

02-12-2018T17:36:45,Vatruvius,Hello Rima.
02-12-2018T17:36:53,RimaDraws,Sup
02-12-2018T17:38:26,Vatruvius,"Just talking, was trying to see others opinion about using flashbacks as an element of the story above."
02-12-2018T17:39:11,RimaDraws,I can’t look I’m driving plus on phone
02-12-2018T17:39:46,Vatruvius,Hm...
02-12-2018T17:39:56,RimaDraws,Not driving now so what’s up
02-12-2018T17:42:28,Vatruvius,Just trying to determine if what I think would be a great story telling tool would be something others would find interesting when reading. I would like to use flashbacks actively.
02-12-2018T17:42:51,Vatruvius,I will paste the example I wrote earlier.
02-12-2018T17:43:03,Vatruvius,"For example, you are following the protagonist in the present but discover their experiences that drive their motivations through flashbacks."
02-12-2018T17:43:11,Vatruvius,"As the present moves forward so do the flashbacks, kinda of like following the protagonist but in two timelines."
02-12-2018T17:43:12,Dadrobit,I'm with Azuma. Flashbacks are something to use very sparingly.
02-12-2018T17:43:17,Dadrobit,used*
02-12-2018T17:43:19,MarshallMelon,"In Medias Res, it's called"
02-12-2018T17:43:40,MarshallMelon,"Can be good if done right, but over-reliance can hurt the plot"
02-12-2018T17:44:07,Vatruvius,I am not using flashbacks to dump information on the reader.
02-12-2018T17:44:22,Dadrobit,"When they're used overmuch, it just feels like ""Oh, the author didn't plan this character's character this far ahead, so they're just adding information to make it fit."""
02-12-2018T17:44:36,Vatruvius,It is essentially two stories on the same character at different times.
02-12-2018T17:44:50,MarshallMelon,But the other story is necessary to understand the character in the main plot
02-12-2018T17:44:55,MarshallMelon,"Ergo, information dump"
02-12-2018T17:45:02,Dadrobit,"""Oh, another flashback to try to make me feel for somthing that's only just now getting established."" It's very droll"
02-12-2018T17:45:12,Vatruvius,I am not coming at it that way though Dadro. My am coming in knowing the full extent of the flashbacks.
02-12-2018T17:45:30,Dadrobit,Then it's just pointless filler no?
02-12-2018T17:45:48,Vatruvius,It would not even come close to appearing or reading that way.
02-12-2018T17:46:24,Vatruvius,"It is not pointless filler, it serves a very important purpose..."
02-12-2018T17:46:52,Dadrobit,"Earlier you said it would be done to ""hold information back"" and now it's ""known to the full extent"""
02-12-2018T17:47:45,Dadrobit,"It's either/or. What your hypothesizing is called ""trying to have your cake and eat it too."""
02-12-2018T17:48:05,Vatruvius,"Okay, so if I never had any flashbacks and started the comic from the beginning of the first flashback, it would be just a normal story arch that progresses forward. There would be two climaxes, one in the middle and one at the end, then end being larger."
02-12-2018T17:48:24,Dadrobit,Sounds like a fairly stock standard story.
02-12-2018T17:48:38,MarshallMelon,"As I said before, In Media Res CAN work. But usually only once"
02-12-2018T17:48:47,Vatruvius,"What I want to do is splice the two climaxes together, so two stories at different times happening together. They naturally feed eachother."
02-12-2018T17:48:56,MarshallMelon,"Like, if you have to have a flashback segment, then only have ONE flashback segment"
02-12-2018T17:49:11,Dadrobit,How shall I say this.... Good fucking luck maybe?
02-12-2018T17:49:57,Dadrobit,How many pages do you have officially written and completed?
02-12-2018T17:49:57,Vatruvius,Would such a thing be really that bad to read?
02-12-2018T17:50:20,Dadrobit,"Actually, probably yes."
02-12-2018T17:50:26,Azumachan,yes
02-12-2018T17:50:45,Vatruvius,"Oh, no pages written. I am conceptualizing my story. This flashback thing has been the backbone of how I wanted to tell the story."
02-12-2018T17:51:18,Vatruvius,"I have lore and characters and stuff, but I have not committed to anything."
02-12-2018T17:51:24,MarshallMelon,If the pages alternate then it could get confusing for the average viewer. I suppose if each page was itself split between present and past with a clear divider then it could work
02-12-2018T17:51:36,MarshallMelon,But if done poorly it could also be an assault on the eyes
02-12-2018T17:51:41,Dadrobit,Having the reader swapping back and forth their focuses on two distantly related stories lessens the focus you'd have on both individually that I don't think even a potentially fantastical climax could assuage.
02-12-2018T17:52:35,Vatruvius,A flashback and present would be multiple pages if not quite a few pages long and would be obvious which is which.
02-12-2018T17:52:59,MarshallMelon,Why not just make them two separate comics and update them simultaneously?
02-12-2018T17:53:14,Vatruvius,The finale climax ties in the flashback climax.
02-12-2018T17:53:33,MarshallMelon,Then link them at that point. They don't have to be together to be connected. Look at Marvel or DC
02-12-2018T17:53:37,Vatruvius,They are following the same protagonist.
02-12-2018T17:53:50,Dadrobit,Or make them one after the other chronologically? Like a normal comic?
02-12-2018T17:54:02,Dadrobit,Or a normal story for that matter.
02-12-2018T17:54:18,Vatruvius,"I could do that, but I rather liked that idea of telling the story differently than everyone else."
02-12-2018T17:54:40,Dadrobit,Sounds like you need to brush up on your Hero's Journey. Not a chance you read the book I proffered a few nights ago?
02-12-2018T17:54:48,MarshallMelon,"The problem is sometimes an idea isn't done because it's hard to put into practice, not because nobody's thought of it"
02-12-2018T17:56:24,Vatruvius,Both of you are really against flashbacks altogether as if they are the devil or something.
02-12-2018T17:56:50,MarshallMelon,Dude I repeatedly said it can work. Just not in the way you want.
02-12-2018T17:56:58,MarshallMelon,I can stop being polite about this if you want
02-12-2018T17:57:05,Dadrobit,"Literally said the exact opposite. ""Flashbacks are something to use very sparingly."""
02-12-2018T17:57:21,Vatruvius,What you said was to throw my idea into the garbage and only have one flashback.
02-12-2018T17:57:31,MarshallMelon,Because it won't work well
02-12-2018T17:57:49,MarshallMelon,Some things aren't done because they're just not a good approach
02-12-2018T17:58:10,MarshallMelon,"Your idea, for instance, has an extreme danger of being confusing and convoluted as the plots progress"
02-12-2018T17:58:31,MarshallMelon,"You'd need to have a clear marker to separate the two, but that would defeat the purpose"
02-12-2018T17:58:42,Dadrobit,"To say nothing of the fact that you haven't even tried it yet, and yet you're betting on it completely and utterly."
02-12-2018T17:59:04,Vatruvius,"See, anything that I would say that would make it obvious one was a flashback over the other would be a spoiler to the story."
02-12-2018T17:59:17,MarshallMelon,Therein lies the issue
02-12-2018T17:59:19,Dadrobit,Ideas can be fun. But execution is everything.
02-12-2018T17:59:37,MarshallMelon,"If you have two separate plots but don't differentiate them, then how is the reader going to know which is which?"
02-12-2018T17:59:41,Vatruvius,"I am not betting everything on it, but I have been working from this viewpoint for a while and it seems like a very good way to tell the story I created."
02-12-2018T18:00:24,MarshallMelon,"Well, we're not stopping you from trying it out. Just offering some constructive criticism"
02-12-2018T18:00:29,Vatruvius,"No, I cannot tell YOU what would differentiate them because that would be a spoiler. It is right there in the comic the entire time and obvious to the reader."
02-12-2018T18:01:11,Dadrobit,It seems that putting a train in a vacuum tunnel would create a perfect environment for a zero drag fast travel system. But it's still kind of a shit idea.
02-12-2018T18:01:31,MarshallMelon,To be fair that would be badass if it weren't so expensive
02-12-2018T18:01:37,MarshallMelon,WHY EVERYONE COST MONIES
02-12-2018T18:01:38,Dadrobit,And hella dangerous.
02-12-2018T18:01:46,MarshallMelon,"*Everything, fuck"
02-12-2018T18:02:04,Dadrobit,"""Everyone has a price"" -MarshallMelon probably"
02-12-2018T18:02:25,MarshallMelon,Why can't I own people for free? Isn't that what the dream's all about?
02-12-2018T18:03:03,Dadrobit,"Also, if it's obvious to the reader, then what's the point???"
02-12-2018T18:03:13,MrMongMong,It was attempted a while ago. The problem is keeping water out of the system.
02-12-2018T18:03:59,Dadrobit,"The problem wasn't water, it was the 13th ammendment."
02-12-2018T18:04:08,MarshallMelon,Just have a tunnel that suspends the train in an electromag field
02-12-2018T18:04:11,MarshallMelon,MagLev 2.0 baby
02-12-2018T18:04:12,Dadrobit,Or are we back on the vacuum train?
02-12-2018T18:05:07,MrMongMong,I meant the train.
02-12-2018T18:05:40,MarshallMelon,"Anyways, Vat, your idea has some merit. But it might need a lot of experimentation first. Good luck."
02-12-2018T18:06:08,Dadrobit,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hero_with_a_Thousand_Faces Here, Vat. I truly and honestly encourage you to read up on writing."
02-12-2018T18:06:12,MrMongMong,Or you could do Brandon Sanderson book 3 and make it all a flashback.
02-12-2018T18:06:31,MarshallMelon,Flashbacks in flashbacks. It's flashbacks all the way down
02-12-2018T18:06:32,MrMongMong,He made it work well.
02-12-2018T18:06:53,Dadrobit,"If you want to do it, then go for it. Do it. Just be aware that it's almost certainly not going to be anything close to a smooth process."
02-12-2018T18:14:13,MrMongMong,"Tip: You could add slight clues, things that indirectly assume one is in the future."
02-12-2018T18:15:08,MrMongMong,"Things like a tree that seems to appears in both, but one isn't as grown. That sort of thing. But if you want to do that, you should mask it with a lot of other details."

02-12-2018T18:15:43,MrMongMong,"Wait, the first emojji was a mistake."

02-12-2018T19:00:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Not that he even has a scheduled time as far as I know
02-12-2018T19:03:50,RimaDraws,hi

02-12-2018T19:18:25,CommanderTrace,watch this xD
02-12-2018T19:18:29,TerraTheWizard,and what character do you wish you could draw more of?

02-12-2018T19:45:02,Dadrobit,I can't quite make out that mic... I think it's a Shure KSM44A?
02-12-2018T19:46:13,Dadrobit,"Very rounded body, similar. But the badge is hidden."

02-12-2018T19:51:14,RimaDraws,o/
02-12-2018T19:55:53,RimaDraws,so my backlog is clearing
02-12-2018T20:14:38,Dadrobit,"Back. And yeah, almost certain on the mic. https://i.imgur.com/gA1DaXG.jpg"
02-12-2018T20:14:48,Dadrobit,Congrats on clearing the backlog.
02-12-2018T20:16:13,RimaDraws,yea im not out of the woods yet
02-12-2018T20:21:12,RimaDraws,i got four old drawings to finish then 3 new ones
02-12-2018T20:21:17,RimaDraws,plus a new one coming in after
02-12-2018T20:21:24,RimaDraws,but im waiting to do that cause its an animation
02-12-2018T20:21:30,Dadrobit,"Ohhhhh, fun"
02-12-2018T20:21:58,Dadrobit,:( The video seems to have disappeared.
02-12-2018T20:22:53,RimaDraws,yea its fun alright
02-12-2018T20:22:58,RimaDraws,i can't wait to get back to my TK art
02-12-2018T20:23:33,Dadrobit,What gear/software are you using for the animation?
02-12-2018T20:23:38,RimaDraws,clip

02-12-2018T20:28:55,Dadrobit,"Aye, Wacom is just outside the range of financial appropriateness. Was looking into X-Pen slightly moreso than Huion."
02-12-2018T20:29:04,RimaDraws,yea its worth it
02-12-2018T20:29:26,RimaDraws,i love my graphics tablet

02-12-2018T20:30:58,Dadrobit,Lots of faulty hardware and bad to terrible customer service makes my hyper-leery of the Huion hype.
02-12-2018T20:33:55,RimaDraws,yea i got the xp pen and it took a bit to install but i got it to work
02-12-2018T21:10:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"@Dadrobit If you're still here, I have a Huion tablet and I love it.  It's managing to keep me from playing video games XD"
02-12-2018T21:18:05,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I mean I know that there are plenty of legit experiences that folks have had with them, but the level of sketch I also see is just... Eughhhh"
02-12-2018T21:19:17,Dadrobit,"""Tablet broke under warranty. Customer service refused to do anything other than make me do self diagnosis until I threatened a bad review on Amazon. They finally agreed to ship a new one, but I had to pay shipping from China."""
02-12-2018T21:20:22,Dadrobit,I've seen that story more than a few times in reviews and review comments that it seems to be more than a few isolated cases. It just looks really bad.
02-12-2018T21:21:39,Dadrobit,"On the plus side, I just got a message from FedEx that they're finally shipping my new laptop. Really stretched that 3-7 bus. day shipping."
02-12-2018T21:22:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"The whole sketchy huion things is news to me, and sweet news on the laptop."
02-12-2018T21:26:26,Dadrobit,"Yeah, jut a month or so ago one of the ""Hype Huion"" reviewers took her original review down and made a new video chronicling her issues over they time she had hers. The comments are split with ""What? Mine works fine after years of use!"" and"

02-12-2018T21:27:47,Dadrobit,Just seems like kind of a Russian Roulette.

02-12-2018T21:38:44,Dadrobit,"If it works, then yeah, run with it for sure."
02-12-2018T21:39:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Will say this tho, I'm pretty sure XP-pen has better screens.  A reveiwer I watched when picking out mine said he loved his huion but XP looked better"

02-12-2018T21:42:32,Dadrobit,good*

02-12-2018T21:42:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,This guy
02-12-2018T21:43:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,he also made a list of favorite tablets
02-12-2018T21:44:15,Dadrobit,"Ah, yep. I found that guy. Was considering maybe getting the XP Pen Artist 12. Before I had to fork out for a new laptop...."
02-12-2018T21:44:28,Dadrobit,From his review I hould say.
02-12-2018T21:45:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,The Artist 12 looks awesome from what I seen of it
02-12-2018T21:46:57,Dadrobit,"Seems very affordable, but again, it's a review after only a short time of using it. Finding folks who do ""One-Two Years Later"" reviews is damn near impossible."
02-12-2018T21:48:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Its a newer tablet, so Its gonna be while before they show up"
02-12-2018T21:51:54,RimaDraws,ive had mine for half a year
02-12-2018T21:52:27,Dadrobit,"Yeah, but they have older variants as well. But it's pretty universally difficult to find long term usage reviews."
02-12-2018T21:58:12,RimaDraws,i didn't do a review :P

02-12-2018T22:28:07,RimaDraws,hi
02-12-2018T22:32:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera’s playing hind n seek
02-12-2018T22:32:50,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s too late for this
02-12-2018T22:32:57,SpazztasticKiwi,hide
02-12-2018T22:41:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I lured him in with food. Now I copy words
02-12-2018T22:44:27,SpazztasticKiwi,With Mark yelling in the background I guess
02-12-2018T22:46:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Mark yelling is oddly soothing
02-12-2018T22:46:58,Dadrobit,"Quick question Rima. You're using Clip for animation? What version? Looking at packages that are offered, you can only animate up to 24 frames unless you're using the top tier version. If you aren't using that, do you find it gimped in any other ways?"
