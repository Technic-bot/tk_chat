26-11-2018T00:16:38,Vatruvius,Hello! :ptv-greetings:
26-11-2018T00:17:03,Ordithus,Hi Vat
26-11-2018T00:23:51,Vatruvius,"If you are there Tom, I am just curious. Do you use a mask for shading or a separate layer entirely?"
26-11-2018T00:31:24,Twokinds,layer
26-11-2018T00:34:01,Vatruvius,"From what I have seen so far from multiple tutorials, it seems like an easy way about going through this is to base the shadow layer off the flats layer so you have the same transparent pixels?"
26-11-2018T00:35:04,RimaDraws,hi vat
26-11-2018T00:35:24,Vatruvius,Hey Rima.
26-11-2018T00:35:24,Twokinds,I use a mask applied to a group
26-11-2018T00:35:34,Twokinds,Then put all the character shadings inside that group.
26-11-2018T00:35:34,Vatruvius,"Oh, that's clever."
26-11-2018T00:36:31,Vatruvius,So each character has their own shading layer...huh.
26-11-2018T00:36:49,Twokinds,No everything all at once
26-11-2018T00:36:58,Vatruvius,I see.
26-11-2018T00:37:12,RimaDraws,thats what i do
26-11-2018T00:37:13,Vatruvius,"That's what I thought I saw in stream, just done all at once or almost all at once."
26-11-2018T00:38:06,Vatruvius,"I assume darker shads, like under the neck, etc, is another shading layer applied over another then?"
26-11-2018T00:38:11,Vatruvius,shades*
26-11-2018T00:38:18,Twokinds,Yes
26-11-2018T00:38:27,Twokinds,Obviously
26-11-2018T00:39:13,Vatruvius,"I can see myself now, I am going to be lost in the world of Photoshop when Christmas rolls around."
26-11-2018T00:39:34,RimaDraws,i tried using it doesnt appeal to me
26-11-2018T00:44:22,Vatruvius,"To each there own I suppose. Photoshop kind of runs in the family. My mom does/did graphic design, my sister is studying graphic design, all on Photoshop or the Adobe Suite."
26-11-2018T00:44:42,Vatruvius,I'll take advantage of my student status to pay less and see if it works out well.
26-11-2018T00:44:56,RimaDraws,i honestly wish i had a hand for it
26-11-2018T00:45:42,Vatruvius,For graphic design?
26-11-2018T00:51:33,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz: Night!
26-11-2018T00:51:57,Vatruvius,Goodnight Ord.
26-11-2018T00:52:59,RimaDraws,no photoshop for illustrating
26-11-2018T00:55:38,RimaDraws,and yes graphic design
26-11-2018T00:55:43,Vatruvius,"Ah...yeah it is pretty complicated. My mom took classes, my sister is majoring in graphic design, so it certainly is not easy. There are standards the businesses use and certain ways about doing things."
26-11-2018T00:56:32,RimaDraws,im just an art major
26-11-2018T00:56:38,RimaDraws,wanting my masters to teach college art
26-11-2018T01:01:00,Vatruvius,"Wow, my grandma taught college art. Art history I believe it was be she is an active artist. Mostly works with oil paints but also works on restorations."
26-11-2018T01:01:09,Vatruvius,but*
26-11-2018T01:01:22,RimaDraws,mhm
26-11-2018T01:06:12,Vatruvius,Why....uh...how...*suppressed laugh*
26-11-2018T01:06:45,Vatruvius,"I just can't do it...this is some of the most foul comedy I have listened to but, I"
26-11-2018T01:06:56,Vatruvius,be lying if it isn't making me laugh.
26-11-2018T01:07:04,RimaDraws,lol

26-11-2018T21:06:51,MrMongMong,"Yes. I made that overly complicated, didn't I..."
26-11-2018T21:08:27,Vatruvius,"Darn, I can't see it...it doesn't come up!"
26-11-2018T21:08:42,Vatruvius,That or I am doing this the complete wrong way.
26-11-2018T21:09:18,Vatruvius,BRB
26-11-2018T21:10:58,RimaDraws,i love that voting thing its cool
26-11-2018T21:11:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera caught another 🐁
26-11-2018T21:11:50,Vatruvius,"Alright, I am back."
26-11-2018T21:14:08,Vatruvius,"Yeah, it won't load!"
26-11-2018T21:15:06,Vatruvius,There it is! That took way too long.
26-11-2018T21:15:41,Vatruvius,lol
26-11-2018T21:15:43,Vatruvius,Very nice.
26-11-2018T21:16:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Awoooooooo
26-11-2018T21:17:05,Vatruvius,"I mean, how can you not!?"
26-11-2018T21:17:08,Vatruvius,:ctwokinds-awoo:
26-11-2018T21:17:45,SpazztasticKiwi,:ctwokinds-awoo:
26-11-2018T21:22:14,Vatruvius,"I have noticed, as of late, that I am starting to think I should scrap, or rather, rebuild what I have so far for my webcomic. There are some basic stuff that I want to keep but I feel like I need to restructure a few things to help make it make more"
26-11-2018T21:22:17,Vatruvius,sense.
26-11-2018T21:22:25,Vatruvius,"Or, at the very least, more natural."
26-11-2018T21:25:24,RimaDraws,i mean do what you feel is right
26-11-2018T21:26:11,Vatruvius,"I guess that is the nice thing with being this early on and planning ahead, I can scrap everything if I so wish."
26-11-2018T21:26:35,Vatruvius,"Luckily, I do not have to scrap that much, more like restructure what I have."
26-11-2018T21:27:39,RimaDraws,yea but this is why i plan out my comic so i dont have to scrap anything
26-11-2018T21:29:49,Vatruvius,"I am not actually that far into the actually comic. I am still universe building for the most part and trying to get things to work. I just feel like I want mostly everything planned out before I really start on publishing anything,"
26-11-2018T21:29:54,Vatruvius,which is months out anyway.
26-11-2018T21:30:38,Vatruvius,"I have developed my main characters quite a bit, but now I feel like I need to develop my villain more than I already have because he just does not seem to fit in with everything else."
26-11-2018T21:31:03,Vatruvius,Too many loose ideas.
26-11-2018T21:32:42,RimaDraws,yea
26-11-2018T21:42:35,unsteddyphoenix,Nice decorations Rima
26-11-2018T21:45:27,RimaDraws,thanks
26-11-2018T21:45:31,RimaDraws,i did them myself
26-11-2018T21:55:31,SpazztasticKiwi,🥧
26-11-2018T22:32:01,Dadrobit,"After two hours, the first two waves of updates (170) are in. At least 7 more now."
26-11-2018T22:34:22,Vatruvius,Updates for what?
26-11-2018T22:34:51,Bgrmystr2,his laptop
26-11-2018T22:35:55,Vatruvius,Why are there 7 updates to your laptop?
26-11-2018T22:36:17,Bgrmystr2,did you miss the whole point of his work laptop keeled over hard
26-11-2018T22:36:18,Bgrmystr2,and died
26-11-2018T22:36:27,Bgrmystr2,he's been talkin about it for several days now
26-11-2018T22:36:40,Bgrmystr2,though the whole process :c
26-11-2018T22:37:08,Bgrmystr2,he's just getting it back from the repair shop
26-11-2018T22:37:38,Bgrmystr2,and needs to install updates to get thousands of dollars worth of software licences.
26-11-2018T22:37:42,Vatruvius,"I have been absent the last few days save for right after yesterdays stream? No, Sunday's stream. So I have not read anything about Dadro's broken laptop."
26-11-2018T22:37:43,Bgrmystr2,basically.
26-11-2018T22:37:55,Vatruvius,Ouch...
26-11-2018T22:37:56,Bgrmystr2,well then you've missed a whole damn lot
26-11-2018T22:42:04,Dadrobit,I think that was it. I think I'm done getting Windows Updates so far as I can tell. Now to see if my computer is still recognized by Avid and Waves after the reformat. (It should most definitely?)
26-11-2018T22:42:28,Bgrmystr2,hope it works well :C
26-11-2018T22:42:42,Dadrobit,"Also, yeah. Sorry if I'm being a pest about this in chat. It's just really stressing me out. I hate not being able to do work."
26-11-2018T22:44:29,Dadrobit,"I actually managed to do a story narration gig last night anyways though. Use a field recorder to do the recording instead of my studio gear, and I just did the editing on my gaming PC and was able to get that sent out this morning for better or for worse"
26-11-2018T22:44:36,Dadrobit,Used*
26-11-2018T22:45:47,Vatruvius,"Nice, and I hope everything goes wells with your laptop."
26-11-2018T22:46:04,Dadrobit,"Got an email from the engineer while I was installing a shower earlier that it worked well enough, so I at least got that done."
26-11-2018T22:46:38,Dadrobit,"Thanks kindly, downloading all the audio software stuffs now to see if I can't unlink them from that computer."
26-11-2018T22:47:13,Dadrobit,Which is suspiciously working fine so far actually.
26-11-2018T22:47:43,Dadrobit,Still gonna retire it though. It's just too big a risk to keep it as my mainstay.
26-11-2018T22:47:56,Vatruvius,"Having a ""this is too good to be true"" moment?"
26-11-2018T22:48:01,Bgrmystr2,yeah with all the trouble it's caused you so far
26-11-2018T22:49:44,Dadrobit,:( I love this little EliteBook. It's enabled my entire business for me to now...
26-11-2018T22:50:23,Vatruvius,All things come to pass as one point or another.
26-11-2018T22:50:36,Vatruvius,Upgrades happen eventually.
26-11-2018T22:50:52,Vatruvius,"Or, in this case, age."
26-11-2018T23:03:06,Dadrobit,\o/ Waves recognized the PC and all of my post production shenanigans are saved on my cloud account!
26-11-2018T23:03:31,Dadrobit,Now onto Avid to see if they'll play nice.
26-11-2018T23:05:21,Vatruvius,Great news!

26-11-2018T23:29:35,RimaDraws,no he knocked over my 300 piece puzzle
26-11-2018T23:29:43,RimaDraws,i put him in the bedroom so i can work on commissions
26-11-2018T23:30:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera’s being a good little furry loaf and snoozin
26-11-2018T23:30:56,SpazztasticKiwi,He caught me a mouse
26-11-2018T23:31:08,Dadrobit,"Most people are like, 60% water. I am made of 60% relieved muscles."
26-11-2018T23:31:25,RimaDraws,i need to find another form of punishment than the spray bottle
26-11-2018T23:31:35,SpazztasticKiwi,So...60% tenderized meat?
26-11-2018T23:31:48,Dadrobit,I am a tender man.
26-11-2018T23:31:52,RimaDraws,lol
26-11-2018T23:32:05,RimaDraws,hes soft
26-11-2018T23:32:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Then how are you single
26-11-2018T23:32:49,Dadrobit,"Because I work out of my home and the only time I socialize is either with family, the folks at the grocery store, or the local arcade."
26-11-2018T23:33:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"That pesky “get out there”, huh"
26-11-2018T23:33:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Same here
26-11-2018T23:33:31,Dadrobit,"Not having school, while having worked graveyards for something like 3 years killed my social life lol."
26-11-2018T23:34:01,RimaDraws,maybe  he doesnt want anyone
26-11-2018T23:34:25,RimaDraws,or because people keep forcing him to interact with others he doesnt want to
26-11-2018T23:35:27,Dadrobit,"Also, I'm really terrible at flirting with girls I'm not already with."
26-11-2018T23:35:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Didn’t figure that
26-11-2018T23:35:57,Dadrobit,Literally every relationship I've ever been in was started because the girl finally asked me out.
26-11-2018T23:36:03,RimaDraws,i  just tell people i dont want anyone because i dont
26-11-2018T23:36:20,RimaDraws,i dont want a man with kids or previously marriedi
26-11-2018T23:36:30,RimaDraws,i got crimson thats all i need
26-11-2018T23:36:33,Dadrobit,"""Wait, you were flirting the whole time? You weren't really just curious about my hair care products?"""
26-11-2018T23:36:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Ah
26-11-2018T23:36:46,SpazztasticKiwi,The clueless
26-11-2018T23:36:55,Dadrobit,"For someone so tender, I am very dense."
26-11-2018T23:36:55,SpazztasticKiwi,If that’s not me..
26-11-2018T23:37:03,RimaDraws,lol
26-11-2018T23:37:29,Dadrobit,Suave by the way.
26-11-2018T23:37:40,RimaDraws,ugh suave
26-11-2018T23:37:50,RimaDraws,that makes my hair chunk up
26-11-2018T23:37:54,RimaDraws,i use pantene
26-11-2018T23:37:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"Unless you ask me to dinner, be fully aware that I likely just think you’re a decent human and good male example"
26-11-2018T23:38:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause oh boy am I clueless on what constitutes as flirting from a guy
26-11-2018T23:39:02,Dadrobit,"""I thought you were just taking pity on me."""
26-11-2018T23:39:12,RimaDraws,i avoid flirty guys
26-11-2018T23:39:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"In general, I mean"
26-11-2018T23:39:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Some are unfortunately or rudely obvious
26-11-2018T23:40:20,RimaDraws,or just losers
26-11-2018T23:44:40,RimaDraws,sorry too harsh
26-11-2018T23:44:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Well some are
26-11-2018T23:45:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I was referencing the bad pick up lines and things like asking your number before they even know your name or say hi
26-11-2018T23:46:28,RimaDraws,i dont want to know someone like that. rather not have a normal guy
26-11-2018T23:48:54,Vatruvius,"I'd like to consider myself normal but the more ""normal"" guys I meet I realize I am a rarity. And like you Dadro, I am terrible at socializing we ith girls."
26-11-2018T23:49:09,Vatruvius,with*
26-11-2018T23:49:14,RimaDraws,aww
26-11-2018T23:49:23,RimaDraws,you socialize with me
26-11-2018T23:50:03,Dadrobit,"Well. I'm not terrible at socializing. I don't mind chatting with anyone. Only when I have to consider interest in another person, then the ""don't fuck this up"" mentality blocks be."
26-11-2018T23:50:05,Dadrobit,me*
26-11-2018T23:50:15,Vatruvius,"In person, I freeze up. Of course it has beens a couple years and I am a little more confident about myself now, but I think it is still there."
26-11-2018T23:50:44,RimaDraws,you wouldn't think i am so introverted but yea
26-11-2018T23:53:45,Dadrobit,"Dunno, if it was one thing I learned from HS so long ago, it was confidence and charisma in public speaking. Since I had ""the voice"" I was always the one put on the spot to read things, or the one in the band to talk to the crowd to talk to the audience."
26-11-2018T23:54:02,Vatruvius,"Might best guess, if she can like despite my nerdy character, then there is truth to it."
26-11-2018T23:54:05,Twokinds,I am very outgoing.
26-11-2018T23:54:05,Dadrobit,That last sentence was a mess.
26-11-2018T23:54:21,RimaDraws,really?
26-11-2018T23:54:26,Dadrobit,You go out to mow the lawn and go to ComicCon.
26-11-2018T23:54:38,Vatruvius,"This is why you dislike the sun, right Tom?"
26-11-2018T23:54:53,Vatruvius,"Outgoing people never like the sun, it burns you."
26-11-2018T23:55:23,RimaDraws,i hate the sun
26-11-2018T23:55:24,Twokinds,Oh yeah!
26-11-2018T23:55:45,Twokinds,I even when to the other side of the world. That's pretty far out going.
26-11-2018T23:55:54,unsteddyphoenix,Internet chatrooms count as outgoing right?
26-11-2018T23:55:59,RimaDraws,no
26-11-2018T23:56:00,RimaDraws,lol
26-11-2018T23:56:01,unsteddyphoenix,Look at all this socialisation
26-11-2018T23:56:01,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s outgoing in that he goes outside occasionally
26-11-2018T23:56:11,Vatruvius,"Call me weird, but I do like the sun. Wake up to it every morning. Got a window facing east."
26-11-2018T23:56:24,RimaDraws,hiss
26-11-2018T23:56:26,RimaDraws,lol
26-11-2018T23:56:31,Twokinds,I've left my house a total of 13 times this year so far. More than once a month on average!
26-11-2018T23:56:49,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: you've not melted yet?!
26-11-2018T23:56:55,Dadrobit,Jesus Christ how horrifying.
26-11-2018T23:57:00,SpazztasticKiwi,So your outings almost measure up to your comic’s existence on the planet
26-11-2018T23:57:04,unsteddyphoenix,Did you live?
26-11-2018T23:57:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Congratulations
26-11-2018T23:58:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"But anyway, I can only recall a few times something a guy said made the conversation (and my interest) 🛬💥"
