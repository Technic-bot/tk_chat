01-12-2018T13:27:59,Xexanoth,what about a dry blanket?
01-12-2018T13:29:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Nah
01-12-2018T13:31:00,Mippy,I ave a Star Wars blanket....and I found a bag of my old jeans in the basment. They stil fit. Score. Now I don't have to buy more.
01-12-2018T13:42:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I bought a new pair day before yesterday
01-12-2018T13:43:20,SpazztasticKiwi,They‚Äôre long but they got pockets
01-12-2018T13:46:20,Mippy,:ctwokinds-karenOOO: pockets!

01-12-2018T13:47:17,Mippy,The ones I found that I'm wearing today have pockets

01-12-2018T13:48:56,Mippy,:ctwokinds-sleepoverA: POKETS!!!!!!
01-12-2018T13:51:39,Xexanoth,i was confused at this before i remember the whole womens jeans and pockets thing.
01-12-2018T13:51:58,Xexanoth,"""everything has pockets why are you so excited...oh right."""
01-12-2018T13:52:17,Twokinds,eugh
01-12-2018T13:52:22,Twokinds,Well that was unpleasant
01-12-2018T13:52:57,Mippy,"Yeah, I was just thinking that te guys who missed or don't remember that conversation probubly have no idea why we are feaking out over pockets"
01-12-2018T13:53:11,Twokinds,Just had to throw an  opossum over my fence to get it out of my yard.
01-12-2018T13:53:46,Xexanoth,uhm
01-12-2018T13:54:47,Xexanoth,new olympic sport opossum throwing
01-12-2018T13:54:57,Mippy,Opossum...you have those where you are. It diden't bite you?
01-12-2018T13:55:57,SpazztasticKiwi,And WHY exactly are you handling opossums
01-12-2018T13:56:22,Mippy,Don't get rabies Tom
01-12-2018T13:56:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Actually opossums are rabies resistant
01-12-2018T13:56:51,Xexanoth,because it was in his yard Kiwi
01-12-2018T13:57:26,Mippy,*shrug* How was I suppose to know?
01-12-2018T13:58:00,SpazztasticKiwi,They‚Äôre basically the only mammals whose body temperature runs too low - most often - for rabies to set in
01-12-2018T13:58:02,CrimsonQuill,Hullo Tom
01-12-2018T13:58:34,SpazztasticKiwi,But that doesn‚Äôt mean other things are in their claws and teeth
01-12-2018T13:59:05,Mippy,I've never even seen a real Opossum. By the way is there any diference betwneen a Opossum and a possum?
01-12-2018T13:59:15,SpazztasticKiwi,The spelling
01-12-2018T13:59:52,Mippy,ok...That always confued me
01-12-2018T13:59:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Possums are cute and furry and live in Australia
01-12-2018T14:00:18,SpazztasticKiwi,North America has the heavy metal version
01-12-2018T14:00:23,SpazztasticKiwi,The opossum
01-12-2018T14:01:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"But anyway. Tom, did you die tho?"
01-12-2018T14:01:46,Twokinds,"Two, two oppossums!"
01-12-2018T14:01:51,Mippy,He got the non existant Opossum rabies
01-12-2018T14:02:05,CrimsonQuill,Hi Tom
01-12-2018T14:02:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Aw

01-12-2018T14:02:28,Twokinds,Had to chuck both over the fence.
01-12-2018T14:02:31,Mippy,IT'S A OPPOSSUM INVASSION!!!!
01-12-2018T14:02:50,Twokinds,"Date in heaven, unfortunately. I'm fairly sure they were pushing up daisies."
01-12-2018T14:02:55,CrimsonQuill,We've had worse with rats.
01-12-2018T14:03:06,SpazztasticKiwi,You never mentioned they were actually dead
01-12-2018T14:03:19,Mippy,...:ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:
01-12-2018T14:03:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I thought you were being really really....
01-12-2018T14:03:25,CrimsonQuill,@SpazztasticKiwi you never asked him.
01-12-2018T14:03:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Special
01-12-2018T14:03:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"Possibly, that is"
01-12-2018T14:04:07,Twokinds,lol I think I'd be afraid to throw a live oppossum
01-12-2018T14:04:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Though do keep in mind they could‚Äôve been playing dead
01-12-2018T14:04:26,CrimsonQuill,"Hey, Tom, may I ask you a favour?"
01-12-2018T14:04:35,Twokinds,That's what I was afraid of!
01-12-2018T14:04:50,Twokinds,"But if they were, they sure didn't flinch. Very good actors."
01-12-2018T14:04:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Opossum chuckin‚Äô: how far can your stupidity throw?
01-12-2018T14:05:17,Twokinds,CrimsonQuill: yes?
01-12-2018T14:05:19,Twokinds,Maybe?
01-12-2018T14:05:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"When opossums play dead, a signal in their brain is sent to the body to mimic death"
01-12-2018T14:05:32,CrimsonQuill,"Ok, here goes."
01-12-2018T14:05:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Even breathing and heart rate slows
01-12-2018T14:05:50,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs hard to ever tell play from real dead
01-12-2018T14:06:01,Mippy,"Well, there goes the funny mental image of Tom chucking live oposumms over a fence"
01-12-2018T14:06:17,CrimsonQuill,"The favour I had in mind was this...when you sketched Halo Raine, I had a bit of a backstory for her..."
01-12-2018T14:06:43,CrimsonQuill,And I changed it to reflect the way things were sketched...
01-12-2018T14:07:01,CrimsonQuill,"I was wondering if I could, when it's on Patreon, post it as a comment."
01-12-2018T14:07:07,CrimsonQuill,The problem being that it's long.
01-12-2018T14:07:12,CrimsonQuill,About a page and a half on word.
01-12-2018T14:07:28,CrimsonQuill,"Yeah, I have a habit of over-contextualising."
01-12-2018T14:07:38,Xexanoth,solve your opossum problem by not having a fence
01-12-2018T14:07:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"@Mippy , all the while, angerly snapping at his wrist ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bite ya! I will! Come here!‚Äù"
01-12-2018T14:08:37,Mippy,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
01-12-2018T14:08:53,Twokinds,That's a tall order.
01-12-2018T14:09:05,CrimsonQuill,Yes it is.
01-12-2018T14:09:07,Twokinds,I think you should post it in the comments.
01-12-2018T14:09:14,CrimsonQuill,That's what I meant.
01-12-2018T14:09:19,CrimsonQuill,In the comments
01-12-2018T14:09:39,CrimsonQuill,"I'm not sure, see, what people'd think of a wall of text with that much backstory."
01-12-2018T14:09:58,Twokinds,I don't want to put a wall of text in the description.
01-12-2018T14:10:24,Mippy,"Personaly, I ususally skip them Quill. Others may reaad it."
01-12-2018T14:10:26,CrimsonQuill,"Yeah, I can guess why."
01-12-2018T14:11:18,CrimsonQuill,"The problem is, I found a way to explain almost everything-from her dual forms (thanks multiverse), to her armour, to why UNSC A.I. 'Red, is blue, and a woman."
01-12-2018T14:11:53,Mippy,Hmmmm....guess I ahve to use my detangler today. Curse my problum hair
01-12-2018T14:13:52,CrimsonQuill,"Heh, I just use a comb when it gets mucked up."
01-12-2018T14:14:02,CrimsonQuill,I had a lot of fun typing things up..
01-12-2018T14:14:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"Brushed or not, mines a mess"
01-12-2018T14:14:15,Mippy,My hair breaks combs
01-12-2018T14:14:18,Twokinds,"I suggest making a google doc link and just commenting with something like ""Here's some backstory for my suggestion: [link]"" in the comments."
01-12-2018T14:14:25,CrimsonQuill,"Ok, thanks Tom."
01-12-2018T14:14:39,CrimsonQuill,Now to learn how to use Google Docs
01-12-2018T14:15:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Curly hair has a fine line between ‚Äúgraceful and gorgeous nature goddess‚Äù and ‚Äúold forest witch‚Äù
01-12-2018T14:15:35,CrimsonQuill,"My hair's strait. It starts off neat in the morning, but at the end of the day needs a good comb."
01-12-2018T14:15:51,CrimsonQuill,"Well, a quick comb...it's not long."
01-12-2018T14:16:17,Mippy,That's the best way I have ever had anyone put it Kiwi. Unfortunetly I'm the witch.
01-12-2018T14:16:34,CrimsonQuill,One of the Lancre Witches?
01-12-2018T14:16:38,CrimsonQuill,From the Ramtops?
01-12-2018T14:17:02,Mippy,I have no idea what you are talking about Quill
01-12-2018T14:17:06,CrimsonQuill,Discworld
01-12-2018T14:17:10,CrimsonQuill,Books
01-12-2018T14:17:20,CrimsonQuill,Some of them have witches
01-12-2018T14:17:30,Mippy,Never read them
01-12-2018T14:17:41,CrimsonQuill,Very good reads
01-12-2018T14:17:54,CrimsonQuill,All of them.
01-12-2018T14:17:59,CrimsonQuill,Star with Mort.
01-12-2018T14:18:29,CrimsonQuill,"That goes for you, Tom, if you ever read them-My dad introduced them to me, and says it's best to start with Mort."
01-12-2018T14:19:41,Mippy,Just started Frankinstine myself.
01-12-2018T14:22:23,Twokinds,It's extremely windy today.
01-12-2018T14:22:26,Twokinds,I hope I don't lose power.
01-12-2018T14:22:35,CrimsonQuill,"I hope so too, for your sake."
01-12-2018T14:22:43,CrimsonQuill,It sucks when the power goes out.
01-12-2018T14:23:15,Mippy,You got candles? Just in case?
01-12-2018T14:23:18,SpazztasticKiwi,The ~wind~ knocks out your power?
01-12-2018T14:23:51,CrimsonQuill,"Well, if the wires are hit by debris, yes."
01-12-2018T14:24:08,CrimsonQuill,Wind blows down tree-tree hits power line-power goes.
01-12-2018T14:24:17,CrimsonQuill,It happens a lot
01-12-2018T14:25:21,Mippy,I've got ice fog right now.
01-12-2018T14:26:34,CrimsonQuill,"Well, it's very wet for me-it 'Raine-d' all afternoon."
01-12-2018T14:26:42,CrimsonQuill,Da-da-da-DUN
01-12-2018T14:26:49,Twokinds,Yeah our power has been knocked out by wind several times.
01-12-2018T14:27:06,Xexanoth,:ptv-shock:
01-12-2018T14:27:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Dude
01-12-2018T14:27:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Just move
01-12-2018T14:27:58,Twokinds,"The power lines that go into our house cut through the woods. So any time there's a windstorm, there's a chance a large tree branch will fall on a wire, and pop!"
01-12-2018T14:28:02,Twokinds,There goes the power
01-12-2018T14:28:06,CrimsonQuill,Yep
01-12-2018T14:28:13,CrimsonQuill,It's happened to us before.
01-12-2018T14:28:19,Mippy,I've seen that happen when I was living in hurricane territory
01-12-2018T14:28:23,CrimsonQuill,And I've seen the damage first hand
01-12-2018T14:31:23,Dadrobit,"Late to the party, but in addition to being rabies resistant, opossums are suuuper docile. They'll hiss at you a bit if you sneak up on them, but 99 times out of 100 they just play dead. The last 1 is where they just skitter away."
01-12-2018T14:31:49,CrimsonQuill,Hello Dadrobit
01-12-2018T14:31:55,Dadrobit,o/
01-12-2018T14:32:41,Mippy,"Hey, Dad"
01-12-2018T14:34:46,SpazztasticKiwi,You know a few nights ago Bagheera spotted a spooder on my bed
01-12-2018T14:35:03,CrimsonQuill,I don't like spiders.
01-12-2018T14:35:05,SpazztasticKiwi,And tried to eat it
01-12-2018T14:35:27,Mippy,"No, spiders where I am right now. XD"
01-12-2018T14:35:56,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúBagheera we don‚Äôt eat spiders. You have food‚Äù
01-12-2018T14:36:37,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs 71 today
01-12-2018T14:36:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Winter is broken
01-12-2018T14:36:50,CrimsonQuill,71 degrees farenheit?
01-12-2018T14:37:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Nah Kelvin
01-12-2018T14:37:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Yes Fahrenheit
01-12-2018T14:37:37,Mippy,-10*C (15*F) and foggy
01-12-2018T14:37:38,SpazztasticKiwi,This is Alabama
01-12-2018T14:38:17,CrimsonQuill,"'Umm, Mr weatherman, can you fix the weather? I think we may have broken it."
01-12-2018T14:39:40,Mippy,*looks out window* Oh yeah...ice fog...definetly ice fog
01-12-2018T14:39:50,Dadrobit,Little brother's been getting into spiders lately. Has a pair of tarantulas and recently caught a juvenile black widow.
01-12-2018T14:40:22,SpazztasticKiwi,You know there‚Äôs a tarantula song?
01-12-2018T14:40:24,Dadrobit,"Pretty lookin' thing actually, bright yellow stripes across it."
01-12-2018T14:40:51,Dadrobit,Smashing Pumpkins - Tarantula
01-12-2018T14:40:54,Dadrobit,Yes
01-12-2018T14:41:03,SpazztasticKiwi,...no
01-12-2018T14:41:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Songdrops
01-12-2018T14:41:27,SpazztasticKiwi,https://youtu.be/DX_rgHHWwv8
01-12-2018T14:42:26,SpazztasticKiwi,And I got another costumer story
01-12-2018T14:42:41,Dadrobit,Costumer?
01-12-2018T14:42:55,Dadrobit,"Also, Smashing Pumpkins did it first."
01-12-2018T14:43:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera is fascinated by the running faucet
01-12-2018T14:45:00,Mippy,"silly kitty, fascets are for people"
01-12-2018T14:45:29,CrimsonQuill,We never call them faucets. We call them taps.
01-12-2018T14:46:15,Mippy,(so do I Quill)
01-12-2018T14:48:39,Dadrobit,"Don't really use either. Just kinda gloss over it and only reference the sink. ""Use the hot water in the sink"""
01-12-2018T14:49:23,CrimsonQuill,"It's kind of confusing for me, whenever I read Calvin and Hobbes, since they always call it the 'Faucet'."
01-12-2018T14:50:42,Dadrobit,The part that dispenses the water is the faucet. The knob/lever you adjust for temperature is the tap.
01-12-2018T14:51:09,CrimsonQuill,"We call the whole thing the tap,"
01-12-2018T14:51:17,Dadrobit,S'what I always figured at least.
01-12-2018T14:52:26,Mippy,"I suppose Dad is probubly technically right. As somone with ""speach issues"" Tap is just easier to say."
01-12-2018T14:54:19,Dadrobit,"Looking at dictionary definitions, it would appear they are somewhat interchangable. However I'd personally use faucet as tap is already a very widely used term both as multiple nouns and verbs."
01-12-2018T14:54:34,Dadrobit,Faucet is pretty much just a faucet.
01-12-2018T14:54:55,CrimsonQuill,Inter-continental dialects of English confuse me sometimes.
01-12-2018T14:55:11,CrimsonQuill,"Heck, inter-country dialects can muck about with my head."
01-12-2018T14:56:11,Mippy,"Well, the good thing about being in Canada is that we kind of get a bit of both. So I can read USA annd Brit books no problum"
01-12-2018T14:56:49,Dadrobit,"Tap could be a faucet, it could be the act of lightly banging on something, it could be the act of drawing out a liquid, it could be the metal piece on a pair of ""tap dancing"" shoes, and it can be the onomatopoeia of itself."
01-12-2018T14:57:10,CrimsonQuill,Yep. Confusing for some.
01-12-2018T14:57:23,Mippy,"Yeah, but context takes care of that."
01-12-2018T14:57:36,CrimsonQuill,It always makes sense in context.
01-12-2018T14:58:43,Mippy,"It's just, like  said, speach issues. Faucet comes out sounding strange. Tap dose not. So I use tap. Either way..."
01-12-2018T14:58:58,Dadrobit,"Ah, and it can also be a tool to create screw threads, and informally the act of listening in on a phone call,"
01-12-2018T14:59:19,RimaDraws,home
01-12-2018T14:59:23,Dadrobit,"But alas, I will too stick to ""sink"""

01-12-2018T15:01:40,Dadrobit,"Also, I'm actually about to head out for a bit for some lunch. Have a good one y'all."

01-12-2018T15:03:40,Dadrobit,Gotta lose some pounds here. This 190 bullshit is going out the door.
01-12-2018T15:04:10,Dadrobit,Spinach and kale smoothies are back on the menu!
01-12-2018T15:04:19,RimaDraws,honey i wish i was 190

01-12-2018T15:05:02,CrimsonQuill,Spinach trumps Kale though.
01-12-2018T15:05:13,CrimsonQuill,I just love vegetables.
01-12-2018T15:05:37,Dadrobit,"Spinach I like, Kale is palatable. It tastes like raw broccoli."
01-12-2018T15:05:38,RimaDraws,i seriously wish i  was 190
01-12-2018T15:05:40,CrimsonQuill,"Seriously, steamed cabbage, with a bit of salt, served with some bacon is a heavenly dish."

01-12-2018T19:47:11,twentydollarcoffee,O.o
01-12-2018T19:47:31,ThingsAreMoving,I imagined a person putting a ton of gummybears on a pan and tossing in some eggs with them

01-12-2018T20:50:29,twentydollarcoffee,thx for the stream
01-12-2018T20:50:40,ThingsAreMoving,It's not even 2am over here
01-12-2018T20:50:49,ThingsAreMoving,those macros do speed stuff up
01-12-2018T20:51:04,Mippy,I‚Äôve got 6:50pm
01-12-2018T20:51:09,KipArto,I really should do my own art instead of constantly watching people better than me
01-12-2018T20:51:17,KipArto,I'll never get better at this rate XD
01-12-2018T20:51:28,ThingsAreMoving,watching is a way to learn some tricks too
01-12-2018T20:51:35,Vatruvius,^
01-12-2018T20:51:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,must learn all the trickes
01-12-2018T20:51:46,Mippy,It‚Äôs all about practice Kip (and learning)
01-12-2018T20:51:50,RimaDraws,i learned how to get better by watching tom
01-12-2018T20:51:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,trickes? tricks
01-12-2018T20:51:56,KipArto,"true, very true, but I'm not even ready for this level of trickery"
01-12-2018T20:52:08,ThingsAreMoving,gotta start somewhere
01-12-2018T20:52:10,unsteddyphoenix,I love tips/tricks
01-12-2018T20:52:31,KipArto,"yes, but I'm not just starting, that's the thing. I've been drawing on and off for 20 years"
01-12-2018T20:52:36,ThingsAreMoving,"post your favorite trick, unfteddy"
01-12-2018T20:52:43,KipArto,I'm just not nearly as good
01-12-2018T20:52:47,Mippy,:ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:
01-12-2018T20:52:59,KipArto,"it's fine, I'm actually smiling right now"
01-12-2018T20:53:03,Bgrmystr2,probably because you haven't taken it seriously
01-12-2018T20:53:11,twentydollarcoffee,watching streams is excellent for learning; you just gotta make sure to apply the skills you learn y'know
01-12-2018T20:53:35,Bgrmystr2,"if you don't actually put real effort into trying to learn something, even if years go by, nothing will happen"
01-12-2018T20:53:42,Vatruvius,The problem there @KipArto is the
01-12-2018T20:53:47,Vatruvius,"""off"" part."
01-12-2018T20:53:47,ThingsAreMoving,It's similar to my programming skills. I've been learning on/off for two years now. Still at basic level.
01-12-2018T20:53:56,ThingsAreMoving,gotta commit a lot of time to git gud
01-12-2018T20:53:57,Bgrmystr2,exactly ^
01-12-2018T20:53:57,Mippy,"Yeah, you kind of have to want to get better and do the work involved in doing so"
01-12-2018T20:54:04,Vatruvius,Gotta be consistent and always working.
01-12-2018T20:54:09,twentydollarcoffee,im in a Java class and the only way i've retained anything is by doing extra shit outside of class
01-12-2018T20:54:14,KipArto,"yeah, but these aren't teaching streams I'm watching, so I can see all i want but nothing is being explained so I can only learn if i watch intently. which I'm not."
01-12-2018T20:54:18,Vatruvius,"Oh right, I am on arrays now Things...yeah!"
01-12-2018T20:54:20,Vatruvius,XD
01-12-2018T20:54:51,Bgrmystr2,and I guess that's the you problem that you should fix
01-12-2018T20:54:57,Bgrmystr2,actually watch intently and see what he does
01-12-2018T20:55:02,Bgrmystr2,and don't just watch him
01-12-2018T20:55:04,Bgrmystr2,watch lots of artists
01-12-2018T20:55:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,all the artists
01-12-2018T20:55:29,KipArto,"yes, Bgr, I'm more than aware of what needs to be done. I just don't always have a lot of time. for a single guy I'm actually quite busy"
01-12-2018T20:55:32,ThingsAreMoving,afaik Tom was watching a lot of Bob Ross videos to improve on his backgrounds
01-12-2018T20:55:46,ThingsAreMoving,and you can tell they've influenced his works
01-12-2018T20:55:53,Bgrmystr2,lol cuz not being single makes you less busy for some reason xD
01-12-2018T20:56:03,Mippy,All my time is art and work.
01-12-2018T20:56:10,twentydollarcoffee,i'd watch the stream and try to see what he does; then look up that concept after the stream
01-12-2018T20:56:34,KipArto,i didn't say that. i was actually implying that I'm it's unussual for a single guy to be as busy as i get
01-12-2018T20:56:51,Vatruvius,"The way I go about figuring out what Tom does and learn the abilities of my software, then see what Tom does and determine what it is that he is likely doing."
01-12-2018T20:57:02,KipArto,couples are totally busier than single people
01-12-2018T20:57:05,Mippy,Though I do fit a movie or book in from time to time
01-12-2018T20:57:06,ThingsAreMoving,Well in the end it's your choice where you commit your time and resources
01-12-2018T20:57:09,Vatruvius,"For instance, shading is a separate layer with a transparent color."
01-12-2018T20:57:54,Bgrmystr2,I would say that's just ancedotal Arto. Couples are not always busier than single people because it's 100% dependant on what they do. not who they're with. Single people have friends they spend time with just as couples do
01-12-2018T20:58:02,Bgrmystr2,it's all just a matter of perspective.
01-12-2018T20:58:06,Bgrmystr2,and the large picture :)
01-12-2018T20:58:19,KipArto,"averages, on the whole"
01-12-2018T20:58:59,KipArto,obviously the are exceptions. there are exceptions to nearly everything
01-12-2018T20:59:03,Mippy,I agree with Bgr. It depends on the larger picture
01-12-2018T20:59:03,ThingsAreMoving,":ctwokinds-nibsbounce: alright, gonna bounce. See ya next sunday/monday (looking at you kiwibro)"
01-12-2018T20:59:06,ThingsAreMoving,Be good.

01-12-2018T21:00:37,Mippy,"Yeah, I gotta go pretend to be Van Gogh some more. End of semester deadline and stuff"
01-12-2018T21:01:14,Bgrmystr2,lol bye people leaving that aren't me
01-12-2018T21:01:19,RimaDraws,hhm
01-12-2018T21:01:24,Vatruvius,I am actually quite relaxed now that the semester is coming to a close.
01-12-2018T21:01:37,Bgrmystr2,"everyone leaves at the same time for some reason, always when I look away too"
01-12-2018T21:02:00,Vatruvius,That is a YOU problem Bgr. XD
01-12-2018T21:02:19,Vatruvius,"This is your home, perhaps install some better security."
01-12-2018T21:02:41,Bgrmystr2,"HEY no, I literally looked away because I have chocolate and was opening it."
01-12-2018T21:02:50,Bgrmystr2,you say that people leaving are more IMPORTANT
01-12-2018T21:02:55,Bgrmystr2,than chocolate?!
01-12-2018T21:03:05,Bgrmystr2,with rice crisps in it!
01-12-2018T21:03:24,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-pouty: blasphemy I'll have you know
01-12-2018T21:03:54,Bgrmystr2,"also, I saw everyone leave when I looked back, my security is totally fine."
01-12-2018T21:03:58,Vatruvius,"What I am saying is, I can easily watch the chat and open chocolate at the same time. Hell, right now I got jGRASP open, my assignment .pdf, this chat, and Spotify, and can see people leaving and say goodbye."
01-12-2018T21:04:12,Bgrmystr2,"I mean.. I'm not watching what everyone is doing, what are you talking about why would I do that....? :ptv-confused:"
01-12-2018T21:04:39,Bgrmystr2,"ah you're opening chocolate wrong, that's why"
01-12-2018T21:04:42,Vatruvius,"Don't try to turn this on me, this is about you Bgr."
01-12-2018T21:04:47,RimaDraws,>>
01-12-2018T21:05:12,Bgrmystr2,"if you don't give opening chocolate your 100% attention, it's clearly not important enough. xD"
01-12-2018T21:05:42,Bgrmystr2,My chocolate is very important.
01-12-2018T21:06:06,Bgrmystr2,it comes all the way from Europe to be eaten by me.
01-12-2018T21:06:31,Vatruvius,"Chocolate is important to me too, it just doesn't take 2 minutes of my complete attention, more around 5 seconds at most."
01-12-2018T21:06:46,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock:
01-12-2018T21:06:58,Bgrmystr2,it's a huge chocolate bar though
01-12-2018T21:07:04,RimaDraws,lol
01-12-2018T21:07:13,Bgrmystr2,not just some tiny dink thing
01-12-2018T21:07:31,Vatruvius,"Ohh, in that case 8 seconds."
01-12-2018T21:07:32,Vatruvius,XD
01-12-2018T21:07:37,Bgrmystr2,Woww
01-12-2018T21:07:45,Vatruvius,All nice and unfolded too...
01-12-2018T21:07:50,twentydollarcoffee,chocolate requires serious concentration ok y'all are trippin
01-12-2018T21:07:52,RimaDraws,pfft
01-12-2018T21:08:13,Bgrmystr2,coffee gets it
01-12-2018T21:08:24,Bgrmystr2,a glass of class over there.
01-12-2018T21:08:27,Vatruvius,"I am OCD after all, can't have a nice large chocolate bar wrapper be ripped. Gotta be unfolded with zero tears."
01-12-2018T21:09:09,twentydollarcoffee,lol same to you Bgr
01-12-2018T21:09:28,Vatruvius,"Then again, it is known that your fingers do not work Bgr so...in compensation I can see how it would take you 2 minutes. You receive my pardon for that reason alone."
01-12-2018T21:10:14,Bgrmystr2,I'll tale it.
01-12-2018T21:10:17,Bgrmystr2,..take* even
01-12-2018T21:10:17,Bgrmystr2,SEE

01-12-2018T21:11:58,Vatruvius,"At least your brain is goo, right?"
01-12-2018T21:12:00,Bgrmystr2,yes I can.
01-12-2018T21:12:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Then toe me up women
01-12-2018T21:12:09,Bgrmystr2,but my toes are not good at much.
01-12-2018T21:12:29,Bgrmystr2,they used to be good at being obscenely infected and lethal to my health
01-12-2018T21:12:43,Bgrmystr2,and they could have killed me.
01-12-2018T21:12:47,Vatruvius,"""So I chopped them off..."""
01-12-2018T21:12:52,Bgrmystr2,I would have had to actually
01-12-2018T21:12:58,Bgrmystr2,if I wated a month or so more
01-12-2018T21:13:13,Bgrmystr2,not that it would have mattered cuz I may have been dead by then
01-12-2018T21:13:17,Vatruvius,A month or more for what?
01-12-2018T21:13:35,Bgrmystr2,I had a staph infection in both of by big toes
01-12-2018T21:13:46,Bgrmystr2,due to ingrown toenails on both sides of both of em
01-12-2018T21:14:03,Vatruvius,Ouch...
01-12-2018T21:14:08,MviluUatusun,"Well, I'm going to head off to bed.  I'll see y'all later."
01-12-2018T21:14:12,Bgrmystr2,"you ever stub your toe and bitch about the pain, boy I tell you what, I understand."
01-12-2018T21:14:21,Vatruvius,"I had a staph infection in my intestines, I will let you guess where I found out."
01-12-2018T21:14:29,Vatruvius,Bye Mvilu.
01-12-2018T21:14:35,Bgrmystr2,seeya mvilu
01-12-2018T21:14:42,twentydollarcoffee,ouch Vat
01-12-2018T21:15:12,Vatruvius,"I do not have ingrown toenails, by on both of my big toes they curl inward...when it is cold it hurts."
01-12-2018T21:15:18,Bgrmystr2,"so yeah I ended up in the hospital a few times due to my toes, got it all fixed though, toenail roots cut on the sides, it's all good."
01-12-2018T21:15:23,Vatruvius,but*
01-12-2018T21:15:29,Combak,... Where did you find out? In the hospital?
01-12-2018T21:15:44,Vatruvius,"Nice, I am thinking about doing that for mine Bgr."
01-12-2018T21:15:52,Bgrmystr2,but now they're just kinda.. toes. they don't do much. but I can toe MARV probably :ptv-ohmy::ptv-snicker::ptv-tease::ptv-SteelwormHades:
01-12-2018T21:15:56,Vatruvius,Who Combak?
01-12-2018T21:16:05,Combak,You.
01-12-2018T21:16:48,RimaDraws,i used to have problems with mine
01-12-2018T21:16:50,Vatruvius,"On my own, I figured it was a yeast infection and went to the dermatologist. They took a sample and sent it to the lab. Turned out to be both yeast and staph."
01-12-2018T21:17:44,Vatruvius,"Not a pleasant experience, imagine going to sleep with goo-like ointments....I need not explain further."
01-12-2018T21:17:51,Combak,Eww.
01-12-2018T21:18:05,twentydollarcoffee,ouch
01-12-2018T21:18:09,RimaDraws,oh my
01-12-2018T21:18:16,Vatruvius,"It was painful, the staph portions."
01-12-2018T21:19:21,twentydollarcoffee,yeah that's the kinda shit I hope I never have to deal w lol; sorry you had to though
01-12-2018T21:19:23,Vatruvius,"But, in two to three weeks they were all gone. Still have whats left of the ointments just in case I get any unwelcomed revisits."
01-12-2018T21:19:49,Vatruvius,"Haven't yet, and that is in part do to my diet change."
01-12-2018T21:20:28,Vatruvius,"The theory is that, I was eating too much carbohydrates which let the yeast to grow and weaken my system letting staph develope."
01-12-2018T21:20:34,Vatruvius,develop*
01-12-2018T21:21:04,Vatruvius,"So the lesson here is, watch your diet."
01-12-2018T21:21:15,RimaDraws,oh i didn't know that
01-12-2018T21:21:20,twentydollarcoffee,yeah definitely
01-12-2018T21:21:21,RimaDraws,good health tip vat
01-12-2018T21:21:53,Vatruvius,I am full of health tips...took many years but if you have any questions ask away.
01-12-2018T21:22:22,RimaDraws,i didn't know too many carbs could do that
01-12-2018T21:23:12,Vatruvius,"Yeah, carbs turn right into sugar. It is easy food for your body. Ever have a big bowl of pasta and want to take a nap afterwards, it is because of the drop in blood sugar as it wears off."
01-12-2018T21:23:19,Vatruvius,And yeast live for sugar so...
01-12-2018T21:24:05,RimaDraws,well i knew that
01-12-2018T21:24:37,Vatruvius,That is good.
01-12-2018T21:25:17,RimaDraws,thats why i went to my doctor about august for a health physical
01-12-2018T21:25:22,RimaDraws,and she is helping me lose weight
01-12-2018T21:25:47,twentydollarcoffee,"Imma head out now, have a good week everyone!"
01-12-2018T21:25:57,Vatruvius,"Ah, what was your Doctor's suggestions? If that is too personal than you do not have to share."
01-12-2018T21:26:03,Vatruvius,By dollar.
01-12-2018T21:26:10,Vatruvius,Bye*
01-12-2018T21:26:43,RimaDraws,just to keep my carbs under 30 grams a day and between 1500-1800 calories a day
01-12-2018T21:26:57,RimaDraws,so far ive lost 10 pounds
01-12-2018T21:27:10,RimaDraws,i lost 13.5 but i fluctuate
01-12-2018T21:27:20,Vatruvius,"Not bad, though I have lost 4 pounds in the last week without having to manage my calories at all..."
01-12-2018T21:27:38,RimaDraws,since august im down 10 pounds
01-12-2018T21:27:40,Vatruvius,And it is very simple too...
01-12-2018T21:32:20,RimaDraws,yea
01-12-2018T21:33:19,Vatruvius,"Sorry, got distracted with my program. I just fast in the mornings. Delay my lunch a bit and it works like a charm."
01-12-2018T21:33:38,RimaDraws,i see
01-12-2018T21:33:41,Vatruvius,"I realize this might not work for everyone, depends on how your body responds, but it works for me and is simple."
01-12-2018T21:34:22,Vatruvius,Throw in some exercise and you are golden.
01-12-2018T21:34:33,Vatruvius,"That part I have not been so active, it is very nice inside."
01-12-2018T21:34:34,Vatruvius,XD
01-12-2018T21:35:09,RimaDraws,i walk at work a lot for the time being
01-12-2018T21:35:13,RimaDraws,if i dont i go to the gym
01-12-2018T21:36:27,Vatruvius,"My exercise in minimal, which I am not proud of. Working out is rather difficult in the house. I use to run the track at my old college gym every morning."
01-12-2018T21:36:49,Vatruvius,"But, there is not track at my house."
01-12-2018T21:37:29,RimaDraws,i can say my butt isn't as big
01-12-2018T21:38:14,MrEase,oh is the stream over
01-12-2018T21:38:16,Vatruvius,"I cannot say how my weight hangs on my body, but one thing I do know is the first obvious sign that I am losing weight is the smaller waist size."
01-12-2018T21:38:20,Vatruvius,Yes Ease.
01-12-2018T21:38:39,RimaDraws,my thighs are losing it a bit
01-12-2018T21:38:41,RimaDraws,and my butt too
01-12-2018T21:39:21,Vatruvius,"That sounds about right for me as well, but I just do not know for sure. Will find out when most of my weight is off."
01-12-2018T21:39:57,RimaDraws,i can fit my pants better
01-12-2018T21:40:06,RimaDraws,i just need to lose more and get down a couple sizes
01-12-2018T21:40:35,Vatruvius,"Same, before I could not fit in my pants now I can with a little wiggle room."
01-12-2018T21:41:50,RimaDraws,i mean i wear 20 (sorry im a big girl but ) anyway i fit in my legs better
01-12-2018T21:42:17,Vatruvius,I do not know measurements so...I have no idea what that means.
01-12-2018T21:42:44,RimaDraws,its a size 20 in pants
01-12-2018T21:42:47,RimaDraws,womens
01-12-2018T21:42:57,RimaDraws,im a curvy girl
01-12-2018T21:42:59,Vatruvius,"But I wear 34"" waist pants. I refused to let myself buy larger pants. That was my cutting point."
01-12-2018T21:43:11,RimaDraws,i used to wear a size 12
01-12-2018T21:43:23,Vatruvius,I am not family with women measurements...
01-12-2018T21:43:28,Vatruvius,Huh...
01-12-2018T21:43:42,RimaDraws,i used to be tiny
01-12-2018T21:44:21,Vatruvius,"My sister is tiny, or skinny rather. She inherited a fast metabolism..."
01-12-2018T21:44:31,Vatruvius,She never gains weight...
01-12-2018T21:44:43,RimaDraws,i used to have that
01-12-2018T21:44:47,RimaDraws,till i turned 23
01-12-2018T21:44:56,Vatruvius,"Well, she is 19 so..."
01-12-2018T21:45:03,Vatruvius,I will have my revenge! HAHAHAHHA
01-12-2018T21:45:07,RimaDraws,well she better watch what she eats
01-12-2018T21:45:22,Vatruvius,"She has to, she has like 7 food allergies."
01-12-2018T21:45:28,RimaDraws,ouch
01-12-2018T21:45:34,RimaDraws,what of?
01-12-2018T21:45:43,Vatruvius,"I was the lucky one in the family to only have one, Celiac disease."
01-12-2018T21:46:10,RimaDraws,celiac?
01-12-2018T21:46:43,Vatruvius,"She is allergic to potatoes, soy, corn...a few others I cannot remember, but those are the big three. Emphasis on the corn and soy which you find in literally everything."
01-12-2018T21:47:05,Vatruvius,Celiac disease is what a severe allergy to gluten is called.
01-12-2018T21:47:18,Vatruvius,"So, I eat gluten free stuff."
01-12-2018T21:48:08,RimaDraws,ooh
01-12-2018T21:50:32,RimaDraws,never knew
01-12-2018T21:50:38,RimaDraws,i have a D3 deficiency
01-12-2018T21:50:41,RimaDraws,pretty common
01-12-2018T21:51:20,Vatruvius,"Yeah, it is starting to become much more common. 8 years ago would have never found anything gluten free now you can find a fair number of things gluten free and restaurants offering gluten free options."
01-12-2018T21:57:27,SpazztasticKiwi,The biggest I‚Äôve been is a 16 jeans
01-12-2018T21:57:46,Vatruvius,Well way to brag Kiwi...sheesh!
01-12-2018T21:57:47,Vatruvius,XD
01-12-2018T21:58:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôve had to get rid of, well, all my jeans since I lost"
01-12-2018T21:58:18,SpazztasticKiwi,But I‚Äôm gaining again
01-12-2018T21:58:22,Vatruvius,"These numbers really have zero meaning to them, I have no reference."
01-12-2018T21:58:30,Vatruvius,Oh noes!
01-12-2018T21:58:44,Vatruvius,"Too many streams and not enough walks Kiwi, shame on you."
01-12-2018T21:58:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Well the current jeans I bought just the other day are from the men‚Äôs section
01-12-2018T21:59:09,SpazztasticKiwi,They‚Äôre a 32x32
01-12-2018T21:59:20,Vatruvius,"Close to mine, I am a 34x32"
01-12-2018T21:59:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Still loose in the waist an long in the leg but they fit my thighs
01-12-2018T21:59:45,SpazztasticKiwi,And got pockets
01-12-2018T21:59:58,Vatruvius,"But I think when I lose all my weight I could be a 30x32, maybe even a 28x32 but I think that is pushing it. We'll see."
01-12-2018T21:59:59,RimaDraws,i hate being big
01-12-2018T22:00:00,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-KatDance: I'm back baby
01-12-2018T22:00:12,Vatruvius,Welcome back Ord.
01-12-2018T22:00:18,Vatruvius,You are not alone Rima.
01-12-2018T22:00:29,Vatruvius,I am self conscious about my weight.
01-12-2018T22:00:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"If I could flat my stomach and slim the thighs, I‚Äôd be happy"
01-12-2018T22:00:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"But my stomach, even as I lose weight, seems to be where the weight stays"
01-12-2018T22:01:10,Vatruvius,Yeah...I understand.
01-12-2018T22:01:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I used to be a few pounds shy of Marks
01-12-2018T22:01:53,Vatruvius,I do not know Marks size...
01-12-2018T22:02:18,SpazztasticKiwi,He used to be 176. He‚Äôs lost as well but he also started working out
01-12-2018T22:02:28,Vatruvius,"*cough* stalker *cough*...sorry, had something in my throat."
01-12-2018T22:02:40,SpazztasticKiwi,He posted a picture in Instagram
01-12-2018T22:02:50,Vatruvius,That does not surprise me.
01-12-2018T22:03:08,SpazztasticKiwi,And he‚Äôs covered his weight loss before in videos as he‚Äôs been working out
01-12-2018T22:03:17,Vatruvius,That is true...
01-12-2018T22:03:32,Vatruvius,"But, I would never keep his sizes in my mind."
01-12-2018T22:03:36,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs odd for me to be so close in weight to him
01-12-2018T22:04:00,Vatruvius,"It's because he is so sho...I mean tall. Yeah, that is the word. XD"
01-12-2018T22:04:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Actually he‚Äôs close to my height
01-12-2018T22:04:36,Vatruvius,"I am teasing him, but I do believe I am taller."
01-12-2018T22:04:39,SpazztasticKiwi,The difference is likely no more than 3 inches if even that
01-12-2018T22:05:05,Vatruvius,"Isn't he 5' 4""?"
01-12-2018T22:05:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"When I met Jacksepticeye, I wasn‚Äôt expecting him to be as tall as he was"
01-12-2018T22:05:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"And judging that Mark comes close to Jack‚Äôs height, which Jack being ~just~ a hair or so taller.."
01-12-2018T22:06:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"Using all that, I estimate Mark is, maybe at the most, half a head taller than me"
01-12-2018T22:06:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I know how crazy this sounds by the way
01-12-2018T22:06:50,Vatruvius,"Okay, so that would put him at...?"
01-12-2018T22:06:59,RimaDraws,hm
01-12-2018T22:07:01,SpazztasticKiwi,5‚Äù5ish
01-12-2018T22:07:11,RimaDraws,hes three inches shorter than me
01-12-2018T22:07:16,Vatruvius,...the ideal man. Gotchya.
01-12-2018T22:07:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve been measured at 5‚Äù4-5‚Äù6
01-12-2018T22:08:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"But who knows. At this point, the topic of his height is so worn into the ground I‚Äôm surprised someone hasn‚Äôt taken a measure tape with thin to a meet up and told him to be still a second"
01-12-2018T22:08:26,SpazztasticKiwi,them
01-12-2018T22:10:09,Vatruvius,"Like an annual meat someone brings a post with markings for height, like for children, and each line is Mark at a given year."
01-12-2018T22:10:35,Vatruvius,"""Wow Mark, you are a quarter an inch taller this year!"""
01-12-2018T22:10:38,Vatruvius,XD
01-12-2018T22:10:43,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôd go over well
01-12-2018T22:11:06,Vatruvius,"I'd think so, just need to get Bob's and Wade's support and everything will be...:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:"
01-12-2018T22:11:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"He only looks so short because Bob, Wade, Tyler, and Ethan are all 6 feet at least"
01-12-2018T22:12:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Hard to be average when surrounded by trees
01-12-2018T22:12:25,Vatruvius,"I know, I do not consider Mark short. But it does infuriate him so..."
01-12-2018T22:12:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I think it‚Äôs just something he likes to throw around
01-12-2018T22:13:02,Vatruvius,What does he not like to throw around?
01-12-2018T22:13:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"If he‚Äôs really upset about it, he can get lifts"
01-12-2018T22:13:15,RimaDraws,i think short guys are cute
01-12-2018T22:13:25,Vatruvius,"Well, guess I am not cute."
01-12-2018T22:13:30,SpazztasticKiwi,But nobody give him the idea of heels. He‚Äôd die
01-12-2018T22:13:33,Vatruvius,There goes my hopes and dreams.
01-12-2018T22:13:58,Vatruvius,"That should be a gift, ""for your height"" and heels are in the box."
01-12-2018T22:14:07,RimaDraws,i didn't mean that
01-12-2018T22:14:09,Vatruvius,I think he would wear them on stage...
01-12-2018T22:14:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt see mark being able to walk in heels
01-12-2018T22:14:29,Vatruvius,Just to prove how manley he is.
01-12-2018T22:14:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Not well
01-12-2018T22:14:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I do find it odd he‚Äôs never done a challenge
01-12-2018T22:15:03,SpazztasticKiwi,But it may be because he knows he‚Äôd break an ankle
01-12-2018T22:15:08,Vatruvius,"Nah, he will nail it to prove everyone wrong and brag about his new height."
01-12-2018T22:15:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Have you ever tried heels
01-12-2018T22:15:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Heels are only sexy if you can walk in them and know how they work
01-12-2018T22:15:39,Vatruvius,"No, and I understand they are very difficult. But that is just how I see Mark's personality."
01-12-2018T22:15:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Otherwise you look like a newborn calf learning to walk
01-12-2018T22:16:40,Vatruvius,"I am not really one to prefer heels on women anyway...not a requirement. But, I know girls like to look cute and pretty so..."
01-12-2018T22:16:56,RimaDraws,i dont like heels
01-12-2018T22:17:14,Vatruvius,I do not blame you.
01-12-2018T22:17:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm only fond of being taller and how nice they look
01-12-2018T22:17:39,Vatruvius,"Just imagine though, the actresses that are told to run in them during action scenes in a film...like really!?"
01-12-2018T22:17:39,RimaDraws,im scared to snap my ankles
01-12-2018T22:17:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"In a nutshell, they‚Äôre not in any way practical or comfortable"
01-12-2018T22:17:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I can run in heels
01-12-2018T22:17:58,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs a way to do it
01-12-2018T22:18:12,Vatruvius,"But if something goes wrong, just one thing..."
01-12-2018T22:18:22,Vatruvius,There goes your ankle.
01-12-2018T22:18:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"But it takes practice and after a certain inch height, you don‚Äôt try it"
01-12-2018T22:19:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Like my highest heel is at least 5 inches
01-12-2018T22:19:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Not including the base
01-12-2018T22:19:51,Vatruvius,Those are pretty tall...
01-12-2018T22:20:00,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs a no-run in them height
01-12-2018T22:20:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I had a 3ish inch set but they‚Äôve gone missing
01-12-2018T22:20:59,Vatruvius,Hmm...someone in the house like them maybe?
01-12-2018T22:21:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Hahahahaha
01-12-2018T22:21:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Sister wears tennis shoes and flip flops only and my mother walks with a cane
01-12-2018T22:21:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Neither would have interest
01-12-2018T22:21:45,Vatruvius,A friend then...?
01-12-2018T22:22:10,SpazztasticKiwi,They may have gotten thrown out somehow
01-12-2018T22:22:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Who knows. Didn‚Äôt really wear them
01-12-2018T22:22:24,Vatruvius,"Maybe...but that would be surprising, no?"
01-12-2018T22:23:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I may be able to find the place that sells the same pair with the 5 inch heel if you‚Äôd like to see
01-12-2018T22:23:57,Vatruvius,I am sure I could just head over to my sister closet and dig through her mound of shoes and find a few pairs of heels.
01-12-2018T22:32:28,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúWhy are you wearing my stillettos?‚Äù
01-12-2018T22:32:38,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing an experiment‚Äù
01-12-2018T22:33:31,SpazztasticKiwi,But really I have heels for essentially just costume stuff
01-12-2018T22:34:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt exactly have date to wear them to and I‚Äôm not really up to wearing heels for a date. Can‚Äôt do much in them
01-12-2018T22:36:28,Ordithus,Aren't they kinda bad for your back?
01-12-2018T22:37:11,RimaDraws,heels ? yes
01-12-2018T22:39:33,Vatruvius,"Right, I need a break. I will catch you all in an hour or two."
01-12-2018T22:39:40,RimaDraws,ok ^^
01-12-2018T22:39:45,Ordithus,see ya vat
01-12-2018T22:41:28,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all.
01-12-2018T22:41:39,RimaDraws,hi dad
01-12-2018T22:41:50,Ordithus,Hi robit!
01-12-2018T22:42:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Dates can be bad for your back too
01-12-2018T22:42:35,SpazztasticKiwi,...watch your gutter brains
01-12-2018T22:44:07,Dadrobit,"Like, those little sweet dried fruit things? Where'd you hear that?"
01-12-2018T22:45:51,RimaDraws,like pruines
01-12-2018T22:45:53,RimaDraws,prunes
01-12-2018T22:45:54,RimaDraws,omg
01-12-2018T22:49:42,SpazztasticKiwi,You guys were young once
01-12-2018T22:49:55,Ordithus,That was a long time ago
01-12-2018T22:50:07,SpazztasticKiwi,What would a 12/13 year old boy like for Christmas
01-12-2018T22:50:22,SpazztasticKiwi,And I‚Äôm not getting him playboy
01-12-2018T22:51:20,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:
01-12-2018T22:52:02,Ordithus,"When I was that age I liked books, video games, and movies.  And food."
01-12-2018T22:52:29,Bgrmystr2,playgirl...?
01-12-2018T22:52:33,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-SteelwormHades:
01-12-2018T22:52:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"Ok, anyone but Bgr got other suggestions"
01-12-2018T22:53:05,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
01-12-2018T22:53:07,Bgrmystr2,ow
01-12-2018T22:53:23,SpazztasticKiwi,He does like bugs and those remote control truck toys
01-12-2018T22:53:26,Ordithus,You did it to yourself
01-12-2018T22:54:17,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, just observe him Kiwi"
01-12-2018T22:54:25,Bgrmystr2,watch what he gets super hype about
01-12-2018T22:54:29,Ordithus,RC trucks is something I wouldn't get unless you really know what he wants.  And that can get spendy
01-12-2018T22:54:49,SpazztasticKiwi,He‚Äôs also that kid that kinda gets what he wants so I‚Äôm not really looking to get him a RC truck. Especially he‚Äôs had one already and broke it
01-12-2018T22:55:00,SpazztasticKiwi,since
01-12-2018T22:55:19,Bgrmystr2,clooooooooooothes
01-12-2018T22:55:26,Ordithus,Socks
01-12-2018T22:55:49,Bgrmystr2,"""EW I DiDn'T wAnT cLoThEs!@"
01-12-2018T22:55:55,Bgrmystr2,etc
01-12-2018T22:55:59,Bgrmystr2,perfect gift
01-12-2018T22:56:34,Ordithus,[You'll wear it and cherish it]*:ctwokinds-flomad:
01-12-2018T22:57:07,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, if yer kid is into anime an you get him anime shirts, he will flip in a good way"
01-12-2018T22:57:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Pants might be good. He‚Äôs apparently been growing out of stuff quick the past few years
01-12-2018T22:57:13,Bgrmystr2,so clothing.. not always bad.
01-12-2018T22:57:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Odd since he‚Äôs not forced to eat what he should
01-12-2018T22:57:54,Bgrmystr2,"personally, I hate the idea of giving clothes as gifts unless they REALLY need it and hurt for money"
01-12-2018T22:58:09,Ordithus,He's just in that age range where he grows.  a lot
01-12-2018T22:58:23,Bgrmystr2,cuz the season is about giving stuff that's not really stuff you *need*
01-12-2018T22:58:31,Bgrmystr2,and clothing is part of that necessity
01-12-2018T22:58:45,Ordithus,"Thing is, if I don't *need* it, I don't really want it that bad"
01-12-2018T22:59:09,Ordithus,"And if I *need* it, I get it"
01-12-2018T22:59:13,Bgrmystr2,"someone getting me clothes of some anime or game I liked, that'd be a good gift, cuz it's not something I'd just wear simply cuz it's a necessity"
01-12-2018T22:59:15,Ordithus,Don't buy me presents other than food
01-12-2018T22:59:26,Bgrmystr2,lol buys you food for gifts..
01-12-2018T22:59:43,Bgrmystr2,just.. here.. I bought you bread from the store.. got a wrapper and everything :D
01-12-2018T22:59:45,Ordithus,"Wine, beer, chocolate, all good"
01-12-2018T22:59:58,Bgrmystr2,none of those are necessity foods lol
01-12-2018T23:00:02,Ordithus,I would eat that bread.  And enjoy it
01-12-2018T23:00:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Foods my kind of present too
01-12-2018T23:00:15,Ordithus,"You don't live, bgr"
01-12-2018T23:00:40,Bgrmystr2,"Oh I live, I just have standards. If it's something that constitutes an everyday life expenditure, it's not a gift."
01-12-2018T23:00:46,Bgrmystr2,bread would not be a gift.
01-12-2018T23:00:59,Bgrmystr2,bread is just.. food shopping.
01-12-2018T23:01:05,Ordithus,"What if it's really good bread?  Like, the best bread you've ever had?"
01-12-2018T23:01:32,Bgrmystr2,"then maybe, but I'm just talking about boring sliced bread"
01-12-2018T23:01:34,Bgrmystr2,that everyone has
01-12-2018T23:01:34,Ordithus,Food also doesn't accumulate in a closet
01-12-2018T23:01:50,Ordithus,Unless you want ants
01-12-2018T23:02:26,Bgrmystr2,"maybe if it was like super fancy and expensive, french bread or somethin"
01-12-2018T23:02:41,Bgrmystr2,there's some really fancy stuff like that around here
01-12-2018T23:02:44,Bgrmystr2,I could see that
01-12-2018T23:02:53,Bgrmystr2,cuz it's not something everyday.
01-12-2018T23:03:20,Bgrmystr2,"if someone bought me some hotdogs, buns, and chili for christmas.. we gonna have a chat."
01-12-2018T23:03:27,Bgrmystr2,cuz that's not how you christmas.
01-12-2018T23:03:44,Bgrmystr2,"you damn right I would eat them, but still"
01-12-2018T23:05:18,Dadrobit,"Left to go bake a fish, back again."
01-12-2018T23:05:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"*Bgr, mouth full* ‚Äúyou know this isn‚Äôt a proper Christmas present?‚Äù"
01-12-2018T23:05:59,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúYet you‚Äôre eating it‚Äù
01-12-2018T23:06:02,Dadrobit,"And Yeah, unless I'm getting a $80+ Filet Mignon, not really a fan of getting food as a gift."
01-12-2018T23:06:13,Dadrobit,"Cookware, that's a gift."
01-12-2018T23:06:15,Ordithus,:tropical_fish::ctwokinds-renirawr:
01-12-2018T23:06:27,Bgrmystr2,"lol I wouldn't eat it immediately, kiwi xD"
01-12-2018T23:06:28,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs a fancy cut of Nemo
01-12-2018T23:06:44,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, see that's fancy dadro"
01-12-2018T23:06:58,Ordithus,"Hence wine, beer, or chocolate.  Tasty stuff, but not everyday either"
01-12-2018T23:06:59,Dadrobit,"Oh, and a gift for a young teen? $20 to GameStop or something?"
01-12-2018T23:06:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm more of a non-breaded catfish person myself
01-12-2018T23:07:16,SpazztasticKiwi,He‚Äôs not allowed at GameStop
01-12-2018T23:07:28,Dadrobit,0.o
01-12-2018T23:07:37,Dadrobit,"Like, GameStop won't let him in?"
01-12-2018T23:07:47,Bgrmystr2,make sure he would go to a store you buy a card for.. my grandparents bought me some itunes card thing..
01-12-2018T23:07:53,Bgrmystr2,like wtf am I gonna use that for
01-12-2018T23:07:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"As loose as they are with him, his parents are strict on what he and the other kids can watch/play"
01-12-2018T23:08:05,Dadrobit,"Ohhhhh, okay."
01-12-2018T23:09:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Example: he can run outside in the dirt with no shoes but he can‚Äôt watch Rick and Morty like stuff as far as I know
01-12-2018T23:09:43,Dadrobit,Those parents are doing it fucking right.
01-12-2018T23:10:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"And he‚Äôs usually allowed to play YouTube on his mom‚Äôs phone as much as he likes. A way they monitor what he does, I‚Äôm sure"
01-12-2018T23:10:26,Bgrmystr2,yeah cuz they can see the video history
01-12-2018T23:10:36,Dadrobit,You could always just ask him ya know?
01-12-2018T23:10:37,Ordithus,"He like bugs, huh?  How about a whole beehive"
01-12-2018T23:10:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm trying to eat. Not choke
01-12-2018T23:11:06,Dadrobit,"Say, ""Hey bud, your limit is $20. What would you like for Christmas?"""

01-12-2018T23:11:22,SpazztasticKiwi,A snake
01-12-2018T23:11:32,SpazztasticKiwi,But his mom isn‚Äôt keen on the idea

01-12-2018T23:12:07,Dadrobit,"Hell, you can get some snakes for free if you just ask. Or they'll be free with a purchase of their tank."
01-12-2018T23:12:10,Ordithus,That's a bigun
01-12-2018T23:12:12,Bgrmystr2,aren't those obscenely expensive?
01-12-2018T23:12:40,Dadrobit,Not the common boa. That's the one shops just give away.
01-12-2018T23:13:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"His mom isn‚Äôt keen on it, and they live with someone who has, and I shit you not in any way, a bone-deep PHOBIA of snakes"
01-12-2018T23:13:08,Bgrmystr2,"Either way, having a pet is responsibility, and gotta think if that kid's responsible enough to take care of it"
01-12-2018T23:13:36,Bgrmystr2,also yeah that might be a thing
01-12-2018T23:13:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don‚Äôt know if anything has changed but from what I‚Äôve seen, he takes care of it for a bit and then doesn‚Äôt"
01-12-2018T23:13:52,Ordithus,Definitely don't get him something his mom will not appreciate
01-12-2018T23:14:00,Ordithus,Sounds like a teen boy
01-12-2018T23:14:08,Dadrobit,"Yeah, they're not puppies, but they do have upkeep."
01-12-2018T23:14:27,Ordithus,Puppies are probably a lot better at reminding you they need upkeep
01-12-2018T23:15:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve got basically all others presents down. His is the question
01-12-2018T23:15:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I may just ask his dad. I work with him
01-12-2018T23:16:51,Ordithus,A bb gun
01-12-2018T23:17:01,SpazztasticKiwi,He‚Äôs got one
01-12-2018T23:17:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Unfortunately
01-12-2018T23:19:14,Ordithus,Has he shot his eye out?
01-12-2018T23:19:24,SpazztasticKiwi,No
01-12-2018T23:19:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"Far as I know, there‚Äôs not been an accident"
01-12-2018T23:19:57,Ordithus,Doing better than the kid in A Christmas Story
01-12-2018T23:20:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Ammo and guns are stored up and away. And are only taken out around an adult
01-12-2018T23:20:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Which reminds me of a day I was over. His sister is my bff since 6th grade but she‚Äôs younger than me by a bit
01-12-2018T23:21:00,SpazztasticKiwi,He and a friend of his wanted to play with the guns but his parents weren‚Äôt home
01-12-2018T23:21:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I was 18/19
01-12-2018T23:21:33,SpazztasticKiwi,So they were like ‚Äúyou count‚Äù
01-12-2018T23:21:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I told them we md wait for mom and dad
01-12-2018T23:21:56,SpazztasticKiwi,we‚Äôd
01-12-2018T23:23:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Funny part was my friend was like ‚ÄúKiwi. You‚Äôre 18. You ARE an adult‚Äù
01-12-2018T23:24:07,Ordithus,"Technically true.  But you weren't their adult, just an adult."
01-12-2018T23:24:30,Ordithus,And probably didn't want the responsibility
01-12-2018T23:25:23,SpazztasticKiwi,To supervise two young boys with BBs?
01-12-2018T23:25:24,Bgrmystr2,"Kiwi, you, as an adult, made the decision to say no."
01-12-2018T23:25:38,Bgrmystr2,that was an adult decision and it was a good one :P
01-12-2018T23:25:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Nope‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
01-12-2018T23:25:49,Ordithus,"Very true, bgr"
01-12-2018T23:25:59,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl: good call
01-12-2018T23:26:16,Twokinds,Someone messaged me saying I drew the Halo helmet wrong.
01-12-2018T23:26:22,SpazztasticKiwi,And technically his sister was there and was allowed to supervise them but
01-12-2018T23:26:38,Twokinds,I will try to go back and fix it up a little to make it more Halo-y. lol
01-12-2018T23:26:40,SpazztasticKiwi,She wasn‚Äôt over 18 at the time. Only I was
01-12-2018T23:26:42,Ordithus,"I would have no idea, Tom"
01-12-2018T23:26:47,Bgrmystr2,did you?
01-12-2018T23:26:49,Bgrmystr2,I can check
01-12-2018T23:27:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Message back: too bad üéª
01-12-2018T23:27:04,Twokinds,I'm afraid I'm not as familiar with Halo as I am with many other games.
01-12-2018T23:27:38,Dadrobit,"Lol, I made the mistake of hopping on Discord just before I got on and some folks were kinda sperging on ""Tom has no clue what he's doing!"" ""That's obviously the Doom helmet!"" and the such."
01-12-2018T23:28:18,Bgrmystr2,"what was the reference you used, Tom?"
01-12-2018T23:28:19,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúY‚Äôall need to go outside‚Äù
01-12-2018T23:28:24,Dadrobit,Buncha Turbo Nerds
01-12-2018T23:28:29,Bgrmystr2,"cuz yeah, I can see why they'd question the helmet"
01-12-2018T23:28:32,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
01-12-2018T23:28:43,Dadrobit,"""I honestly keep looking at this pic and the longer I look the worse it gets"""
01-12-2018T23:29:02,Ordithus,A standard Spartan helmet wouldn't accomodate a wolf anyways
01-12-2018T23:29:06,Dadrobit,Maybe look at getting yourself some real life experiences.
01-12-2018T23:29:09,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúThen either gouge our your eyes or close the tab‚Äù
01-12-2018T23:29:11,Ordithus,Meant for human faces
01-12-2018T23:29:14,SpazztasticKiwi,out
01-12-2018T23:29:31,Bgrmystr2,you can always use the halo wiki for art on the helm http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Mjolnir_Powered_Assault_Armor/Mark_V
01-12-2018T23:29:40,Twokinds,I was using the female varient of this concept art for Halo Reach as reference: https://www.writeups.org/wp-content/uploads/MJOLNIR-Armor-HALO-video-game-Bungie-h.jpg
01-12-2018T23:29:52,Bgrmystr2,aaaahh
01-12-2018T23:29:53,Twokinds,I will try to find better references for the helmet.
01-12-2018T23:30:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Well
01-12-2018T23:30:11,SpazztasticKiwi,That. Is. A halo helmet
01-12-2018T23:30:33,Bgrmystr2,yeah okay I can see where you were going with it
01-12-2018T23:30:46,Ordithus,"Get burned, nerds"
01-12-2018T23:31:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I see no difference
01-12-2018T23:31:50,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, I can see a difference"
01-12-2018T23:31:53,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve seen referenced as halo gear
01-12-2018T23:32:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"But also, they gotta kno: it‚Äôs a game"
01-12-2018T23:32:50,Bgrmystr2,I'm not really sure what direction the helmet is supposed to be facing in the img.
01-12-2018T23:33:06,Bgrmystr2,and I think that's probably not helping
01-12-2018T23:33:51,Bgrmystr2,"but it's close, just needs a few design tweeks lol"
01-12-2018T23:33:54,Dadrobit,"Wait, what? Her forearm is pressed against the face. Is that not obvious?"
01-12-2018T23:34:09,Bgrmystr2,not really no
01-12-2018T23:34:32,Dadrobit,Perhaps it is time you hit up the optometrist.
01-12-2018T23:34:39,Bgrmystr2,"naw, I can see fine, thanks"
01-12-2018T23:37:17,Ordithus,"Yeesh, can you imagine Raine transforming inside of armor?  That would probably be very uncomfortable"
01-12-2018T23:38:04,Bgrmystr2,The fact that the armor works fine for her keidran legs
01-12-2018T23:38:11,Bgrmystr2,which don't work the same way human feet do
01-12-2018T23:38:17,Bgrmystr2,yeah I think it'll be fine
01-12-2018T23:38:20,Bgrmystr2,:P
01-12-2018T23:38:28,Twokinds,https://www.dropbox.com/s/yc0rirsyc3d7xkk/haloraine_helmet.png
01-12-2018T23:38:30,Ordithus,"The tail, the floof"
01-12-2018T23:38:30,unsteddyphoenix,Considering she literally grows in height
01-12-2018T23:38:32,Twokinds,Perhaps this is a bit better
01-12-2018T23:38:46,Bgrmystr2,ohdamn
01-12-2018T23:38:53,Bgrmystr2,that's wicked
01-12-2018T23:38:55,Bgrmystr2,that works
01-12-2018T23:39:17,Ordithus,I think it's much clearer what we're looking at now
01-12-2018T23:39:52,Bgrmystr2,yeah for sure
01-12-2018T23:41:27,Dadrobit,"Yeah, looks more stock standard now."
01-12-2018T23:42:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Just repost it in discord like ‚Äúhappy now?‚Äù
01-12-2018T23:42:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Dunno why they‚Äôre so against crossovers
01-12-2018T23:43:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Normal stuff gets boring after too long
01-12-2018T23:43:27,Bgrmystr2,This one might just partially be the accuracy of it rather than just the crossover itself.
01-12-2018T23:44:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Gotta be perfect :ctwokinds-flomad:
01-12-2018T23:45:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"Speaking of different, I‚Äôm thinking on one of my card suggestions next week"
01-12-2018T23:45:31,Ordithus,"Eh, for finished pieces like the color art it's good to be accurate.  Good on ya for fixing things, Tom"
01-12-2018T23:46:04,unsteddyphoenix,The 1% who noticed now must be appeased
01-12-2018T23:46:08,SpazztasticKiwi,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
01-12-2018T23:46:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Good job bounce

01-12-2018T23:49:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm gonna go on back to copying German vocabulary
01-12-2018T23:50:41,Ordithus,I'd love to have some sort of refresher on my German.  I've forgotten so much
01-12-2018T23:52:10,Twokinds,hallo means hello
01-12-2018T23:52:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Very good
01-12-2018T23:53:05,Dadrobit,gesundheit
01-12-2018T23:53:26,unsteddyphoenix,Didnt realise halo was a german game

01-12-2018T23:54:46,Dadrobit,The more you know!

01-12-2018T23:56:26,SpazztasticKiwi,202 day streak of daily lessons. I‚Äôm not great but I understand
01-12-2018T23:56:27,Ordithus,Ich hab ein auto verkaufen

01-12-2018T23:57:38,Twokinds,Ich bin ein Berliner.
01-12-2018T23:57:46,Ordithus,Ja
01-12-2018T23:58:05,Dadrobit,Du hast mich gefragt und ich hab nichts gesagt.
01-12-2018T23:59:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom...you realize that translates to I am a doughnut
01-12-2018T23:59:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Berliner is a doughnut
01-12-2018T23:59:33,Twokinds,I am indeed
01-12-2018T23:59:39,SpazztasticKiwi,....ok
01-12-2018T23:59:58,Dadrobit,It was the name of a speech given by Kennedy during the Cold War.
