16-02-2018T00:17:26,SageSaga,the people in Devilman are really dumb
16-02-2018T00:17:40,FenceEqualizer,Yeah they are.
16-02-2018T00:17:42,unsteddyphoenix,I can relate to that! :D
16-02-2018T00:17:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yep
16-02-2018T00:18:18,Dadrobit,Very relatable
16-02-2018T00:18:24,FenceEqualizer,"Really plays the ""worse of humanity"" aspect."
16-02-2018T00:18:36,SageSaga,and the rules for demon possession are ill defined
16-02-2018T00:18:41,unsteddyphoenix,the japanese are pretty good for that
16-02-2018T00:19:36,neropan,i really love the soundtrack
16-02-2018T00:19:46,SageSaga,when your friend pulls a boxcutter on a kitten you ditch that friend
16-02-2018T00:20:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,kick his ass first then ditch him
16-02-2018T00:20:16,FenceEqualizer,That kitten needed shanking.
16-02-2018T00:20:46,SageSaga,why did the cat become a devilman?
16-02-2018T00:20:50,SageSaga,can someone explain that?
16-02-2018T00:21:00,unsteddyphoenix,I will after I watch it
16-02-2018T00:21:02,neropan,noo
16-02-2018T00:21:03,FenceEqualizer,A stupid demon tried to possess a cat.
16-02-2018T00:21:20,FenceEqualizer,"But the cat being the most stubborn creature in the world, manage to remain a cat."
16-02-2018T00:21:35,FenceEqualizer,At least that's my head cannon
16-02-2018T00:21:37,neropan,just beware of spoiler laand
16-02-2018T00:21:44,SageSaga,the cat ate a human heart so it had the heart of a man-
16-02-2018T00:21:50,Dadrobit,spooiiiilers!
16-02-2018T00:21:53,neropan,fresh kiwi the boy didnt watched it
16-02-2018T00:22:04,unsteddyphoenix,I must close my eyes to this chat
16-02-2018T00:22:10,SageSaga,im mostly making up stuff and theres a lot of cats
16-02-2018T00:22:16,FenceEqualizer,^
16-02-2018T00:22:27,FenceEqualizer,Also slight derail for anyone who saw killing bites. Cobra Cannon is a horrifying attack. That is all.
16-02-2018T00:22:56,unsteddyphoenix,Cats yess~ Yess~

16-02-2018T00:23:57,neropan,coloring kills me aa
16-02-2018T00:23:57,unsteddyphoenix,I will allow it.
16-02-2018T00:23:57,FenceEqualizer,It is trash anime.
16-02-2018T00:24:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Killing bites = Furry rampage the animation
16-02-2018T00:24:00,unsteddyphoenix,Youre so close to done though

16-02-2018T00:24:40,FenceEqualizer,I hate how true that is marv.
16-02-2018T00:24:52,unsteddyphoenix,But...looks so good. I am noob~
16-02-2018T00:25:03,FenceEqualizer,Oh it is but I can't help but to watch it.
16-02-2018T00:25:19,FenceEqualizer,Like Junk food for the brain.
16-02-2018T00:25:26,unsteddyphoenix,Basically anime in a nutshell
16-02-2018T00:26:28,FenceEqualizer,Also true.
16-02-2018T00:31:49,Ordithus,"Hey, I'm back.  My internet shit itself for a bit."

16-02-2018T16:33:20,BadFoMo,"I also made a thread about this idea on the forums, but it's been a little derailed."
16-02-2018T16:36:47,iliar,About merch... Just put this photo here https://yadi.sk/i/hnSEA-Ti3SWNnp
16-02-2018T16:46:47,Combak,Hmm...
16-02-2018T16:47:02,Combak,I still think Keith's shirt is the best merch idea. :p
16-02-2018T16:55:51,MidnightBlue78,"a TK shirt, withnany character, i would wear without hesitation"
16-02-2018T16:56:03,MidnightBlue78,*with any
16-02-2018T16:59:32,iliar,"Technically, you can print any image on the shirt. It's not very difficult. But it seems to me that the official store would be better"
16-02-2018T17:00:04,Combak,And I'm referring to the shirt Kieth is wearing on the current site banner.
16-02-2018T17:03:02,iliar,You mean this? http://cdn.twokinds.keenspot.com/img/2017header_day.png
16-02-2018T17:03:24,MidnightBlue78,That would be cool
16-02-2018T17:03:34,MidnightBlue78,I would wear it too :ptv-dealwithit:
16-02-2018T17:04:04,iliar,It's look easily for redraw.
16-02-2018T17:05:01,Combak,Yep.
16-02-2018T17:05:26,Combak,I prefer the much more subtle approach to clothing.
16-02-2018T17:06:41,Twokinds,That'd be a very wide shirt
16-02-2018T17:06:48,Twokinds,"Or, the design could go all the way around."
16-02-2018T17:07:00,Combak,... You know exactly what I meant.
16-02-2018T17:07:44,Combak,"BTW Tom, you used the tag""Maddie"" for the previous sketch. You've been using ""Madelyn"" though, so it's the only one with that tag."
16-02-2018T17:07:56,Combak,"Also, take a guess what I've been doing. :p"
16-02-2018T17:14:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"Paper crafting is a hell of a lot of fun, but it takes time. If the pieces aren’t cut right, the creation doesn’t fit correctly"
16-02-2018T17:20:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"I do paper flowers, and that can take about three hours a piece for a half inch wide iris"
16-02-2018T17:22:07,Combak,Wow.
16-02-2018T17:25:30,SpazztasticKiwi,But they’re freakin adorable
16-02-2018T17:26:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’ve been trying my hand at roses of the same size, but they’re not translating as well to such a scale"
16-02-2018T18:03:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"Four more hours till I can go home, and I’m going to be working alone."

16-02-2018T18:39:52,ZahnHolley,everybuddy is there as usual
16-02-2018T19:07:03,Combak,Despite the guarantee of no stream.
16-02-2018T20:17:39,PalmettoPathfinder1,So how is everyone tonight?
16-02-2018T20:19:20,wolfspartan1,ello
16-02-2018T20:19:28,PalmettoPathfinder1,Hello.  :)
16-02-2018T20:20:50,wolfspartan1,whats up :P
16-02-2018T20:22:40,PalmettoPathfinder1,Oh...nothing much.  Wishing my financial situation was a bit better.  Having to deal with bills and trying to get my flexible spending account money.  On top of trying to make sure I have enough money to get my crown and root canal at the end of the month
16-02-2018T20:24:21,PalmettoPathfinder1,"And trying to gather up money to commission artists for some illustrations for some stories I'm writing.  I got a Patreon page set up to help me with some of my finances, but I don't have much on there, plus I haven't had anyone support me in over a year."
16-02-2018T20:24:22,PalmettoPathfinder1,:(
16-02-2018T20:25:06,wolfspartan1,i'm sorry to hear that
16-02-2018T20:29:21,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Yeah.  I just wish I could get some supporters to help out.  Heck, once I start uploading some stuff to it, pretty much you get everything for a messy $4 (although I'm planning on lowering it to $3.50 just to attract people)."
16-02-2018T20:51:56,wolfspartan1,hope it works out for you
16-02-2018T21:16:18,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Thank you.  I'm going to need all the luck I can get.  Already starting to upload some stuff to my Patreon account.  Hopefully, that'll attract some supporters."
