17-07-2018T00:01:31,Bgrmystr2,Congratulations.. you found out that Markiplier is Tom's brother. :P
17-07-2018T01:33:24,Dadrobit,Mmmmm. I love me a good dust/lightning storm.
17-07-2018T01:36:36,Dadrobit,Can't see the other side of the street the dust is gusting around so densely right now.
17-07-2018T04:49:03,Xexanoth,as long as you don't start seeing weird people in cars yelling something about valhalla and witnessing stuff you should be fine
17-07-2018T05:23:44,Dadrobit,"Bruh, do you not know? I live that life."
17-07-2018T05:24:01,Dadrobit,Shiny and Chrome!
17-07-2018T13:57:16,SiliconCarbide,"hm, i must have missed that part of arizona when i drove through it, why did no one tell me?! i always wanted to be a warlord..."
17-07-2018T21:42:56,Dadrobit,http://detonation.us/maps/
17-07-2018T21:43:13,Dadrobit,"Here ya go, it's just north of Holbrook."
17-07-2018T22:50:02,totallynotTrace,"just saw that orcs must die vid. mark sounds more than 10 years younger. And thank you, I finally know what Tom sounds like XD"
17-07-2018T22:55:25,Bgrmystr2,"if you didn't know what tom sounds like, you have not been lurking here nearly long enough"
17-07-2018T23:00:57,totallynotTrace,"uhhh, when did we get into the argument about the definition of a grilled cheese? cuz ive been lurking on streams since about 3 weeks before that"
17-07-2018T23:02:27,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, but clearly it wasn't long enough for you to hear tom talk on the stream"
17-07-2018T23:02:44,totallynotTrace,clearly XD
17-07-2018T23:03:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve been here almost a year now and I’ve heard him speak once
17-07-2018T23:04:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Other than those videos
17-07-2018T23:04:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Have a feeling he’s one of those “not a fan of how I sound on camera”
17-07-2018T23:05:00,totallynotTrace,I am definatly one of those people
17-07-2018T23:09:20,Bgrmystr2,"that doesn't really make sense for tom though, kiwi, cuz he doesn't have to go back and watch the streams"
17-07-2018T23:09:34,TorqueEmUp,"I think that is pretty much a given for Tom. He's an introvert, and doesn't like to be on video, rarely seems to let people take pictures with him, and I've heard Mark has repeatedly tried to get Tom to appear in his videos but Tom refuses."
17-07-2018T23:10:12,Bgrmystr2,yeah it's more than he just doesn't really talk a lot on the streams and focuses on drawing
17-07-2018T23:10:21,Bgrmystr2,"and if he talks, he can't really concentrate"
17-07-2018T23:10:28,TorqueEmUp,"At most you will get Tom say a thing or two here and there. Even when not on video, he doesn't talk much."
17-07-2018T23:10:42,totallynotTrace,remember that for most streamers he will have his voice echoing in his ear
17-07-2018T23:10:47,Bgrmystr2,"well, maybe at cons, Torque"
17-07-2018T23:10:58,Bgrmystr2,"no, nottrace"
17-07-2018T23:11:02,Bgrmystr2,that's not how anyone streams.
17-07-2018T23:11:18,Bgrmystr2,"if you hear yourself, you're doing it wrong."
17-07-2018T23:11:26,TorqueEmUp,"Con or not, it's still a public space. Introverts like me tend to speak less unless around familiar company."
17-07-2018T23:12:16,totallynotTrace,it depends on the streamer.
17-07-2018T23:13:32,totallynotTrace,its funny I dont even have a choice when playing a game. my POS headset forces the mic to echo in the ear. literally it you turn on the mic you get the sound echoed at about .1 sec delay
17-07-2018T23:13:44,totallynotTrace,im not even a streamer
17-07-2018T23:13:55,TorqueEmUp,"Even still, when not drawing, if he wasn't introverted, he would speak before and after he was done drawing. Of course people won't talk much if they are concentrating on something."
17-07-2018T23:14:09,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, that called a mic monitor, it's supposed to do that."
17-07-2018T23:14:14,TorqueEmUp,to a degree
17-07-2018T23:14:18,Bgrmystr2,yeah only when enabled
17-07-2018T23:14:22,Bgrmystr2,it does not do that by default
17-07-2018T23:14:38,totallynotTrace,my mic does it whenever the mic is on
17-07-2018T23:14:40,Bgrmystr2,that's something you have to enable and disable
17-07-2018T23:14:57,TorqueEmUp,Depends on the headset.
17-07-2018T23:15:01,Bgrmystr2,"you have to set that, nottrace, that's not normal, nor is it default"
17-07-2018T23:15:11,totallynotTrace,Yes I know most mics have the option to disable it. as I said. mine is a POS
17-07-2018T23:15:24,Bgrmystr2,you will not find a headset designed to make the user listen to what it records
17-07-2018T23:15:28,TorqueEmUp,"obviously a PC headset with a config menu will have those options, but i've had plenty of headsets where it was on by default and there was no way to shut that off."
17-07-2018T23:15:41,Bgrmystr2,they don't have it on by default XD
17-07-2018T23:15:54,totallynotTrace,turtle beach p11. it does. search it
17-07-2018T23:16:22,totallynotTrace,yeah i dont have config options
17-07-2018T23:16:34,Bgrmystr2,"I own a turtle beach headset, and mine doesn't. That's your own stuff doin it"
17-07-2018T23:16:36,Bgrmystr2,not the headset
17-07-2018T23:16:43,TorqueEmUp,My Turtle Beach X51s do that too
17-07-2018T23:17:12,totallynotTrace,if i plug my headset into a battery bank for a phone it does it if i turn on the mic
17-07-2018T23:17:17,Bgrmystr2,"it's probably what you have it connected to doing it, the headset will not do that by default."
17-07-2018T23:17:36,totallynotTrace,def does it by defult
17-07-2018T23:17:45,Bgrmystr2,"then you don't know how mics work, mate"
17-07-2018T23:18:14,TorqueEmUp,"It does it regardless of what I have it plugged into. I've had adapter cables since it was made for the Xbox 360, and no matter what I use it on, it still has the mic monitor always on."
17-07-2018T23:18:28,totallynotTrace,it has a inline dac thing. it can do it.
17-07-2018T23:19:08,Bgrmystr2,being able to and doing it automatically are two different things
17-07-2018T23:19:53,totallynotTrace,ok then it does it automatically when the mic is switched on
17-07-2018T23:20:25,Bgrmystr2,"You say that, but that's not how mics work. Your headset doing that means whatever it's plugged into has the setting for listening to the mic enabled"
17-07-2018T23:20:48,TorqueEmUp,"wait my bad, mine are Turtle Beach X42s I misremembered."
17-07-2018T23:21:11,totallynotTrace,a battery bank I got at best buy for $10 has a mic input over usb?
17-07-2018T23:21:21,totallynotTrace,I doubt it
17-07-2018T23:22:03,Bgrmystr2,"you can doubt it, but that's how it is. Headsets are not going to automatically push the mic signal to the headphones. they're two separate audio connections"
17-07-2018T23:22:25,Bgrmystr2,tis why there's a earphones connection and a mic connection
17-07-2018T23:22:35,totallynotTrace,nope
17-07-2018T23:22:36,Bgrmystr2,"one's input, one's output"
17-07-2018T23:22:52,Bgrmystr2,"you can't tell me nope, that's how it works, mate"
17-07-2018T23:23:20,Bgrmystr2,plug your mic into the speakers port in your pc and see how much it doesn't play audio
17-07-2018T23:23:26,Bgrmystr2,it's two different connections
17-07-2018T23:23:45,totallynotTrace,"I currently only have a usb plugged into my cpu for headphones. its handling power, mic, pc audio"
17-07-2018T23:23:54,totallynotTrace,its one connection
17-07-2018T23:24:25,totallynotTrace,dac converts it
17-07-2018T23:24:33,Bgrmystr2,"yeah one connection from the headset to the computer, but on the inside, it's not going to connect the two together."
17-07-2018T23:24:48,totallynotTrace,yeah actually it does
17-07-2018T23:24:53,Bgrmystr2,"no, actually, it does not"
17-07-2018T23:25:09,Bgrmystr2,Just because it's over the same wire doesn't mean the signals are fused
17-07-2018T23:25:28,Bgrmystr2,you think HDMI fuses the video and audio together? No. They work completely separately
17-07-2018T23:25:40,Bgrmystr2,one can function while the other does not
17-07-2018T23:25:58,TorqueEmUp,"Also the P11 and the X42 are both console headsets, consoles that don't have support for mic-monitoring."
17-07-2018T23:26:00,Bgrmystr2,"but because they're over the same wire, when the wire dies, both die"
17-07-2018T23:26:27,TorqueEmUp,so they monitoring is built into the internal DAC
17-07-2018T23:26:29,Bgrmystr2,My headset is an EarForce x1. It's an Xbox 360 headset.
17-07-2018T23:26:58,Bgrmystr2,"If it were built in, you'd be able to turn it off."
17-07-2018T23:27:05,Bgrmystr2,Noone would buy a headset just so they can hear themselves.
17-07-2018T23:27:20,Bgrmystr2,not for a console
17-07-2018T23:27:25,TorqueEmUp,Mine does it where there is no lag.
17-07-2018T23:27:43,TorqueEmUp,I am sure some wonky ones may lag.
17-07-2018T23:27:58,totallynotTrace,bgr. I think i know where your going wrong. do you know what I mean by POS?
17-07-2018T23:28:13,Bgrmystr2,"I'm not going wrong, nottrace, I know how they work xD"
17-07-2018T23:28:23,totallynotTrace,define pos
17-07-2018T23:28:27,totallynotTrace,how im using it
17-07-2018T23:28:29,Bgrmystr2,POS stands for piece of shit :P
17-07-2018T23:28:37,Bgrmystr2,tis what it's always stood for
17-07-2018T23:28:38,totallynotTrace,ok good
17-07-2018T23:28:53,TorqueEmUp,PC headsets don't need mic monitoring built in because the PC can do that if you want it to.
17-07-2018T23:29:10,Bgrmystr2,"headsets for consoles are not going to include that, mate xD"
17-07-2018T23:29:14,totallynotTrace,because it being a pos is why you CANNOT TURN OFF THE MONITORING
17-07-2018T23:29:16,TorqueEmUp,"But of course, if you wanted that for consoles, your headset would have to do that itself."
17-07-2018T23:30:49,totallynotTrace,https://support.turtlebeach.com/hc/en-us/articles/221179108-DP11-PC-Microphone-Echo-caused-by-Mic-Monitor-Feature
17-07-2018T23:30:53,Bgrmystr2,"If headsets actually made players hear themselves while hearing everyone else, they wouldn't buy the headsets"
17-07-2018T23:31:14,totallynotTrace,I bought this for console so I cant turn it off
17-07-2018T23:32:20,Bgrmystr2,..are they stupid
17-07-2018T23:32:34,totallynotTrace,yes turtle beach is stupid
17-07-2018T23:32:51,Bgrmystr2,NOONE wants to hear their own voice. Noone on the planet wants to hear themselves when talking to someone else
17-07-2018T23:33:17,Bgrmystr2,you already HEAR yourself when you talk
17-07-2018T23:33:35,Bgrmystr2,that's just.. no
17-07-2018T23:33:38,Bgrmystr2,just fucking no
17-07-2018T23:33:39,Bgrmystr2,Dx
17-07-2018T23:33:45,totallynotTrace,yeah i dont either but i have to cuz my laptop mic has a short so all anybody else hears is a buzz
17-07-2018T23:34:24,Bgrmystr2,you bought this intentionally broken mic why?
17-07-2018T23:34:40,totallynotTrace,laptop or turtle beach one?
17-07-2018T23:34:45,Bgrmystr2,the turtle beach one
17-07-2018T23:34:58,totallynotTrace,cuz it didnt say it did it on the box
17-07-2018T23:35:04,Bgrmystr2,I would have returned it immediately
17-07-2018T23:35:19,Bgrmystr2,"I bet not, they don't wanna advertise shit that noone wants"
17-07-2018T23:35:29,totallynotTrace,I couldnt afford the next most expensive at the time
17-07-2018T23:35:57,Bgrmystr2,"That headset is intentionally broken, that's not normal"
17-07-2018T23:36:26,Bgrmystr2,"normal headsets do not feed the mic to the headphones, noone wants that, and noone expects it"
17-07-2018T23:36:51,totallynotTrace,i dont use my mic a lot so not too much of a problem
17-07-2018T23:37:28,Bgrmystr2,"I would returned it anyway, gotten something else."
17-07-2018T23:38:21,totallynotTrace,the next cheapest didnt have a mic
17-07-2018T23:38:35,totallynotTrace,and i wanted a mic
17-07-2018T23:38:47,totallynotTrace,couldnt afford more expensive
17-07-2018T23:38:53,totallynotTrace,sooooo......
17-07-2018T23:39:08,totallynotTrace,I was in middle school at the time i thiknk
17-07-2018T23:39:24,totallynotTrace,i was using birthday money
17-07-2018T23:40:07,totallynotTrace,honestly surprised it hasnt broken yet. ps im going into 4th year college
17-07-2018T23:40:09,Dadrobit,"Actually, believe it or not, some of us do want that."
17-07-2018T23:40:20,totallynotTrace,thanks dad
17-07-2018T23:40:40,Dadrobit,I have a set of Turtle Beaches that does it and I don't like gaming with my buddies without the ability to monitor how I'm sounding.
17-07-2018T23:40:42,Bgrmystr2,"Not all the time, dadro, and not by default. It's good"
17-07-2018T23:40:55,Bgrmystr2,good* for audio stuff
17-07-2018T23:40:59,Bgrmystr2,but it'd be terrible for gaming
17-07-2018T23:41:07,Dadrobit,"That's like, your opinion man."
17-07-2018T23:41:12,totallynotTrace,its usefull for me only in the fact that i dont have to visually check it the mic is on. I can just hear myself
17-07-2018T23:41:23,Bgrmystr2,How do you not hear yourself when your gaming? You can hear when you talk
17-07-2018T23:41:27,Bgrmystr2,you're the one talking
17-07-2018T23:41:38,Dadrobit,I need to know that I'm speaking clearly and consistently into the microphone.
17-07-2018T23:41:38,Bgrmystr2,what do you need a mic feedback for?
17-07-2018T23:41:56,totallynotTrace,no I mean if I hear my echo i know that my mic is on
17-07-2018T23:42:19,totallynotTrace,if i cant hear my echo my friends cant hear me
17-07-2018T23:42:27,totallynotTrace,cuz my mic is off
17-07-2018T23:43:10,Bgrmystr2,I turn my mic on and know my friends can hear me cuz they respond to me.
17-07-2018T23:43:16,totallynotTrace,but thats the only because of the fact i cant toggle the monitor itself off. only the mic.
17-07-2018T23:43:52,Bgrmystr2,"I don't need anything more than listening to my own voice and controlling it myself, I don't need another feedback loop telling me what I already hear"
17-07-2018T23:43:53,totallynotTrace,my friends are quiet introverts that dont always respond
17-07-2018T23:44:51,totallynotTrace,i should go to bed
17-07-2018T23:44:53,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: Well I can't fix that. that's not a mic problem, that's a people problem"
17-07-2018T23:45:02,totallynotTrace,i know
17-07-2018T23:45:10,totallynotTrace,just one thing
17-07-2018T23:45:20,totallynotTrace,dont buy turtle beach
17-07-2018T23:45:29,Bgrmystr2,I won't buy that specific headset
17-07-2018T23:45:32,totallynotTrace,there are better out there
17-07-2018T23:45:47,Bgrmystr2,and my headset from turtle beach doesn't do it
17-07-2018T23:45:51,Bgrmystr2,so they probably learned their lesson
17-07-2018T23:46:03,Bgrmystr2,was likely something they just tested out
17-07-2018T23:46:08,totallynotTrace,no for the price if you look someplace else for better
17-07-2018T23:46:22,Bgrmystr2,"they aren't expensive, so it doesn't really matter"
17-07-2018T23:46:24,Dadrobit,"Well, yeah, if I don't need communication in a game, the TB's come out and I use my set of Shure SRH840's."
17-07-2018T23:46:27,totallynotTrace,if it works for you then yay
17-07-2018T23:46:33,Bgrmystr2,most things at that price are pretty standard anyway
17-07-2018T23:46:52,Bgrmystr2,you're not gonna find anything SUPER better than turtle beach for the same price
17-07-2018T23:46:52,Bgrmystr2,xD
17-07-2018T23:47:05,Bgrmystr2,unless there's a sale or somethin
17-07-2018T23:47:34,Dadrobit,Sennheiser puts out gaming headsets that are absolutely better for the same price points.
17-07-2018T23:47:57,Dadrobit,"If I had the extra dosh, I'd splurge on one of those."
17-07-2018T23:47:57,totallynotTrace,im gunna end by saying that senheizer (idk how its spelled) makes freeking dreem equipment wat no you dont get to beat me to saying that
17-07-2018T23:48:09,totallynotTrace,XD
17-07-2018T23:48:14,Dadrobit,Lol
17-07-2018T23:48:56,totallynotTrace,g'night guys
17-07-2018T23:49:21,Dadrobit,Night.
17-07-2018T23:49:58,Bgrmystr2,why would you need extra dosh if they're the same price lol
17-07-2018T23:50:00,Bgrmystr2,xD
17-07-2018T23:51:13,Dadrobit,Because they're not going to accept a 6year old set of headphones for trade against one of their new models.
17-07-2018T23:51:25,SpazztasticKiwi,You think dogs see flies as flying raisins
17-07-2018T23:51:39,Bgrmystr2,"well I mean.. if you were gonna buy a new headset anyway, I don't think that's really an issue xD"
17-07-2018T23:51:46,Bgrmystr2,prolly not Kiwi
17-07-2018T23:51:58,Bgrmystr2,they probably don't even know what raisins are
17-07-2018T23:52:07,Dadrobit,"Ah, just saw that meme on Reddit earlier, Spazz"
17-07-2018T23:52:28,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s just
17-07-2018T23:52:42,Dadrobit,"Yeah,but I'm not going to buy one, because the money is not there."
17-07-2018T23:53:02,Dadrobit,It is the limiting factor.
17-07-2018T23:53:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Do they bite at them cause they’re annoying or what
17-07-2018T23:54:19,Bgrmystr2,they bite at them cuz they're there kiwi
17-07-2018T23:54:26,Bgrmystr2,dogs bite everything..
17-07-2018T23:55:17,SpazztasticKiwi,How about this then: is a bike an acoustic motorcycle
17-07-2018T23:55:32,Bgrmystr2,um..
17-07-2018T23:55:51,Bgrmystr2,no
17-07-2018T23:55:54,Bgrmystr2,xD
17-07-2018T23:55:57,Bgrmystr2,just no
17-07-2018T23:56:18,Bgrmystr2,is this the same kinda ppl that ask if mayonaise is an instrument
17-07-2018T23:56:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Or if a fish in water is technically wet
