07-11-2018T15:36:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Reminds me of when I saw someone squirt mayonnaise in vegetable soup
07-11-2018T15:37:16,SpazztasticKiwi,The south is weird
07-11-2018T15:37:22,Mippy,Now that is just strange
07-11-2018T15:37:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel bad for some people who come visit. For things like Mayfest and Mule Day
07-11-2018T15:38:26,SpazztasticKiwi,They see our weird and act like it‚Äôs a foreign country
07-11-2018T15:39:10,Mippy,Mule Day! Like a day to celebrate Mules and all things Muley ?
07-11-2018T15:39:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Kind of
07-11-2018T15:39:22,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs got a parade
07-11-2018T15:39:37,Mippy,"Well, to me it is a foreign country :ctwokinds-clovischuckle:"
07-11-2018T15:40:02,Mippy,Parades are good
07-11-2018T15:40:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"But it‚Äôs mainly a bunch of vendors selling things like personalized belts, Knick knacks, toys, and food"
07-11-2018T15:40:24,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs where I got my flashlight stun gun
07-11-2018T15:40:34,Mippy,Hopefully all Mule themed
07-11-2018T15:40:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Nah
07-11-2018T15:40:54,Mippy,:ctwokinds-karenOOO: flashy stunny
07-11-2018T15:40:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Bunch of football themed stuff tho
07-11-2018T15:41:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Same dude sells knives
07-11-2018T15:41:24,Mippy,Meh...football. Yay! Knifes!
07-11-2018T15:41:26,SpazztasticKiwi,And some border on the side of mini swords
07-11-2018T15:42:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Some have dragon claw hilts
07-11-2018T15:43:31,Mippy,There is a kiosk seller in our local mall that sells both decorative and practical swords and knives. I admit to admiring them every time I pass. I don‚Äôt have the money to buy right now though. I want a decorative piece with a nice Damascus
07-11-2018T15:43:37,SpazztasticKiwi,And there‚Äôs an old timy car show. Perfect for pin up inspiration if you want to study an old model car
07-11-2018T15:44:13,Mippy,The fast food company I work for is known for having car shows like that.
07-11-2018T15:45:20,SpazztasticKiwi,People bring out their horses and wagons too
07-11-2018T15:45:37,SpazztasticKiwi,For the parade
07-11-2018T15:46:31,Mippy,Sounds like some of the stuff that happens out here. (I must admit that I prefer eastern celebrations to the ones here)
07-11-2018T15:47:19,SpazztasticKiwi,They do a pretty good job of keeping the horses to where there‚Äôs no incidents. We did have one year that a young male had an issue with being too close to an older male though
07-11-2018T15:49:23,SpazztasticKiwi,We‚Äôre happily ‚Äúlove is in the air‚Äù accident free though
07-11-2018T15:49:24,Mippy,I‚Äôve never seen anything happen with horses at anything here. I suppose the handlers are pretty good. If the way my friends handle horses is any indication I don‚Äôt expect anything too out of control to happen.
07-11-2018T15:50:22,SpazztasticKiwi,The stallion that started getting upset looked too young to be out. He was broken but still had the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm alpha‚Äù hormones real bad
07-11-2018T15:51:11,Mippy,Ohhhh! XD typical young man then?
07-11-2018T15:51:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Pretty horse. He just was a young whipper snapper
07-11-2018T15:52:50,SpazztasticKiwi,The older horse he was so mad about was only agitated when he got close. Otherwise he just looked like ‚Äúugh. Teenagers.‚Äù
07-11-2018T15:53:56,Mippy,I‚Äôm not horribly knowledgeable about horses unfortunately. They were not part of my life back east. I do however learn something new every time I see my twin friends. They grew up on a farm doing all that cowgirl stuff.
07-11-2018T15:54:15,Mippy,"Yup, old guy has seen it all before XD"
07-11-2018T15:54:30,SpazztasticKiwi,My friend recently got her third horse. Her first is a young stallion she wants to turn into a gelding
07-11-2018T15:54:51,SpazztasticKiwi,He‚Äôs a pretty young pinto
07-11-2018T15:55:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Think the other two are girls
07-11-2018T15:57:11,Mippy,Had to google pinto to see if I was thinking of the right horses. I was. Whent camping with the twins once...we loaded up the horses...my second time handling a horse on my own...scared shitless XD
07-11-2018T15:58:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôm not a horse person but I know a good bit about them. I don‚Äôt do heights though so if I‚Äôm gonna be on a horse, I‚Äôll use a saddle or ride with someone"
07-11-2018T16:01:38,Mippy,I‚Äôm willing to do it again. Leaned a lot that weekend...like don‚Äôt startle you horse with your screams of ‚ÄúIM GONNA FALL!‚Äù . I went home with the worst bruises and sunburn of my life.
07-11-2018T16:03:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"My uncle had horses before he died. One was the calmest thing you‚Äôd ever seen. Unless you were going to set yourself on fire on her back, she gave negative fecks"
07-11-2018T16:04:38,Mippy,"I‚Äôve got to go gather my stuff for class. I‚Äôll be back later. See ya Kiwi, Tom!"

07-11-2018T16:06:21,Twokinds,beye
07-11-2018T16:12:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom you ever rode a horse
07-11-2018T16:14:28,THETOXICATOR,I wonder too
07-11-2018T16:14:40,Twokinds,"I've ridden a horse once, yeah."
07-11-2018T16:14:54,THETOXICATOR,Did you fall
07-11-2018T16:15:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Saddle?
07-11-2018T16:15:17,Twokinds,"yeah, of course."
07-11-2018T16:15:25,Twokinds,"No, I didn't fall."
07-11-2018T16:15:36,THETOXICATOR,I had no saddle one time
07-11-2018T16:16:03,THETOXICATOR,But it was no difference for me
07-11-2018T16:16:36,THETOXICATOR,Have you ridden a bear ?
07-11-2018T16:17:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve rode bareback a few times and I don‚Äôt like it. Didn‚Äôt help that the horse was about 6 feet
07-11-2018T16:17:22,SpazztasticKiwi,tall from the ground
07-11-2018T16:18:50,Bgrmystr2,"so you know, kiwi, the US covers so much area and covers so many different types of people that you will actually find spots that are just as different as a foriegn country."
07-11-2018T16:19:06,Bgrmystr2,it's actually very commno
07-11-2018T16:19:11,Bgrmystr2,common* even
07-11-2018T16:19:38,THETOXICATOR,That's cool
07-11-2018T16:19:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Pretty sure some people come around Mule Day and Mayfest to see the locals
07-11-2018T16:20:19,THETOXICATOR,Its like whole europe +dessert

07-11-2018T16:33:51,Bgrmystr2,I'm just sitting here watching a friend flip out as their home is potentially destroyed in the campfire in Cali right now..
07-11-2018T16:34:07,Bgrmystr2,it's over 8000+ acres right now
07-11-2018T16:34:22,Bgrmystr2,and increasing at 80 acres every minute

07-11-2018T16:38:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh and that‚Äôs bad
07-11-2018T16:38:20,ThingsAreMoving,how does a house burning in a fire reminds you of pizza?
07-11-2018T16:39:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I know I saw a man who turned on his sprinklers before he evacuated for a forest fire
07-11-2018T16:39:52,SpazztasticKiwi,His entire property was untouched
07-11-2018T16:40:02,ThingsAreMoving,is Cali still suffering from drought?

07-11-2018T22:05:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Not sure if much of any of my playlist would be though
07-11-2018T22:08:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Also hello again
07-11-2018T22:43:54,FuryFaZeFurry,"bgr, this is the first time ive been active for months..."
07-11-2018T22:44:10,Bgrmystr2,but you were active before
07-11-2018T22:51:45,FuryFaZeFurry,"ive been active on discord, but ive haven't seen a stream since  i think july...."
07-11-2018T22:52:47,Bgrmystr2,yeah but you were active on streams back then
07-11-2018T22:55:22,FuryFaZeFurry,"back then, but i stopped cause people were getting mad at me."
07-11-2018T22:55:40,Bgrmystr2,Tom was just as active in the chat back then as he is now.
07-11-2018T22:55:56,FuryFaZeFurry,that and i thought they were just streams and i had better things i needed to do.
07-11-2018T22:55:57,Bgrmystr2,hasn't really changed since I've been here
07-11-2018T22:56:11,FuryFaZeFurry,i didn't notice it
07-11-2018T22:57:00,FuryFaZeFurry,do you remember when you told me it was a bad idea to read the comic outloud and post it to youtube/
07-11-2018T22:57:01,FuryFaZeFurry,?
07-11-2018T22:57:09,Bgrmystr2,helps when you been here for more than a few months.
07-11-2018T22:57:27,Bgrmystr2,sorta not really :thinking:
07-11-2018T22:58:17,FuryFaZeFurry,"well ok, do you know how many views i got from it"
07-11-2018T22:59:22,FuryFaZeFurry,"152,849 Views 817 Subscribers...."
07-11-2018T23:02:54,Bgrmystr2,okay..?
07-11-2018T23:03:16,FuryFaZeFurry,just trying to prove a point.
07-11-2018T23:03:25,Bgrmystr2,well your point is lost on me
07-11-2018T23:03:39,Bgrmystr2,cuz I dunno what you're trying to get at.
07-11-2018T23:05:28,Bgrmystr2,"people watch dumb stuff on youtube all the time, views like that don't really mean a whole lot"
07-11-2018T23:40:18,Mippy,Can attest to watching dumb stuff on YouTube. To be honest I‚Äôd rather just read the comic myself rather then listen to some kid do it. I‚Äôm use to the voices the chapters have in my head
07-11-2018T23:40:56,Mippy,Good grammar :ctwokinds-keith8D:
07-11-2018T23:41:38,Bgrmystr2,"you and most others, Mippy"
