15-09-2018T13:39:23,CrimsonQuill,@Mippy Oh no!
15-09-2018T13:39:28,CrimsonQuill,What's happening?
15-09-2018T13:40:24,Mippy,Have to work 1-9 pm. Stream usually starts at 2pm for me. I‚Äôll look in on my break but I won‚Äôt be able to vote or anything.
15-09-2018T13:41:23,CrimsonQuill,I'm in a different time zone-it starts at 9:00pm for me.
15-09-2018T13:45:54,michal1999102,lol welcome to club CrimsonQuill
15-09-2018T13:46:05,Mippy,I started reading AI last night. I‚Äôm not far at all (fell asleep) but have liked what I read. Love that Kevin is playing as a female character.
15-09-2018T13:46:53,Mippy,I kind of wish I was in your time zone right now Quill but what can I do
15-09-2018T13:46:53,CrimsonQuill,"I'm waiting befor I finish Yosh (or rather, get to the current [age) before I start AI. It looks good though."
15-09-2018T13:47:02,michal1999102,it will start with me 22
15-09-2018T13:47:10,CrimsonQuill,"Also, you have my sympathy, Mippy."

15-09-2018T13:50:51,Mippy,*sigh*
15-09-2018T13:51:11,CrimsonQuill,"Well, my University lectures start tomorrow."
15-09-2018T13:51:24,Mippy,I got my suggestion in anyway. I‚Äôll see what happens.
15-09-2018T13:51:35,Mippy,My school started last week
15-09-2018T13:51:46,CrimsonQuill,I'm hoping my suggestion make it too.
15-09-2018T13:52:32,CrimsonQuill,"I've been trying to get a Halo Spartan Raine in for weeks, but I'm trying something different this time, because no-one's voting for her..."
15-09-2018T13:52:39,Mippy,"Well, I figure I‚Äôve been a patron for  awhile now and it‚Äôs obly a matter of time"

15-09-2018T13:53:54,Mippy,I usually don‚Äôt vote cross over because they are usually for things I‚Äôm not a fan of. I think that is the crux of the problem with cross over ideas
15-09-2018T13:55:06,CrimsonQuill,"I just really want to see a Halo crossover, but not many people seem to like the idea..."
15-09-2018T13:55:59,Mippy,Not being a Halo fan I‚Äôm probably guilty of not voteing for it. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è sorry?

15-09-2018T15:54:35,Ordithus,Yes
15-09-2018T15:54:35,SpazztasticKiwi,The whole idea is Nib just sitting there in a tiny Reaper costume and Sythe to her side with a sickle shaped silver hat or something
15-09-2018T15:54:48,CrimsonQuill,@Ordithus I'm glad I'm not the only one.

15-09-2018T19:55:29,Combak,And that's why you watch chat Heresy.

15-09-2018T19:55:55,Bgrmystr2,"tom's screen didn't say anything about the chat, so.. yeah you're looking in the wrong place, Heresy"
15-09-2018T19:56:03,Bgrmystr2,or.. the vote* rather
15-09-2018T19:56:08,Bgrmystr2,should be looking in the chat xD
15-09-2018T19:56:09,HeresyArtStream,Well looks like my suggestion ain't getitng drawn this week. I don't think my vote would have pushed it over the top though.
15-09-2018T19:56:41,BadFoMo,What is a Pillory? Is it that thing that 1500s criminals would get there head and hands locked into?
15-09-2018T19:56:42,Bgrmystr2,it would have only added +1 and only if it was your topmost suggesstion
15-09-2018T19:56:58,ThingsAreMoving,"yes, fomo"
15-09-2018T19:57:06,ElvenHunter84,People usually throw tomatoes at them
15-09-2018T19:57:13,unsteddyphoenix,sometimes it be that way heresy~
15-09-2018T19:57:22,ElvenHunter84,But I interpreted that suggestion in a much... Lewder way
15-09-2018T19:57:59,Zuke,couldve had eric sitting in a corner with his canvas
15-09-2018T19:58:09,BadFoMo,"Ok. ...Also, what is 'Burlesque'?"

15-09-2018T20:03:29,Bgrmystr2,"I mean.. it's not really difficult. I presume you're recording what you see on the screen, but when I record, I use OBS's built-in browser"
15-09-2018T20:03:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,shadowplay
15-09-2018T20:03:48,Bgrmystr2,so I don't need to waste my browser on the video
15-09-2018T20:04:02,Bgrmystr2,shadowplay is pretty bad for resources imo

15-09-2018T20:04:52,Ordithus,Tom didn't have much time to review the suggestions
15-09-2018T20:05:03,Dadrobit,Pillory and Choosing to kill Zen or Keith?
15-09-2018T20:05:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,big nopes to those

15-09-2018T20:06:03,Bgrmystr2,"I can record my desktop and browse using a built-in browser, or use the browser in OBS itself and not worry about it, though it's more resource-intensive cuz better quality"
15-09-2018T20:06:20,Foxpie,tbf i took that as more of a village fate thing
15-09-2018T20:06:28,BadFoMo,So I might have been able to trick Tom into drawing something he said he wasn't interested in drawing?
15-09-2018T20:06:46,Bgrmystr2,"not likely, fomo"
15-09-2018T20:06:55,Bgrmystr2,cuz he still would have read his own pick
15-09-2018T20:06:57,Dadrobit,"Dang, I could've gotten in my ""Alaric taking off Keiths footwraps with his teeth"" suggestion..."
15-09-2018T20:07:04,Bgrmystr2,and you can't fool chat

15-09-2018T20:09:08,Bgrmystr2,Granted Laura would have died anyway
15-09-2018T20:09:15,Dadrobit,Straight up murdered Laura tbh
15-09-2018T20:09:20,microbuss,the last sketch was funny with Trace & Flora as dragons

15-09-2018T20:09:34,Bgrmystr2,cuz laura would have been vaporised by the tower when it exploded
15-09-2018T20:09:41,Bgrmystr2,but Nora happened.
15-09-2018T20:09:49,Dadrobit,And then denied Trace the opportunity of healing her.
15-09-2018T20:09:49,Ordithus,Deus Ex Nora

15-09-2018T20:12:48,Ordithus,Laura was in Trace's arms when Nora grabbed him.  She had external injuries Nora healed.
15-09-2018T20:13:07,Bgrmystr2,"huh, MP4 works in waterfox"
15-09-2018T20:13:29,Ordithus,Trace for some reason wouldn't harm Laura in his evil state
15-09-2018T20:13:29,Bgrmystr2,wonder why it doesn't work in firefox :thinking:
15-09-2018T20:13:33,DarthKeidran,this one will be required to be colored when it finishes
