05-06-2018T00:02:27,SpazztasticKiwi,5 days and my legs no longer feel like they‚Äôre screaming
05-06-2018T00:02:30,CrRAR,"also didn't notice it till looking at it now she has the "":o"" face under her right eye."
05-06-2018T00:02:43,CrRAR,From excessive running?
05-06-2018T00:02:53,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
05-06-2018T00:02:58,unsteddyphoenix,Or standing all day?
05-06-2018T00:03:07,SpazztasticKiwi,50 squats a day
05-06-2018T00:03:33,unsteddyphoenix,Oh yeaah.

05-06-2018T00:03:40,CrRAR,that'll do it
05-06-2018T00:03:46,CrRAR,lol unsteddy
05-06-2018T00:04:03,SpazztasticKiwi,It looks like I‚Äôm one of those ladies who naturally has more muscle in my thighs
05-06-2018T00:04:26,unsteddyphoenix,nice
05-06-2018T00:04:30,CrRAR,With you're suggestion now I'm imagining a group of vaguely familiar characters...
05-06-2018T00:04:48,CrRAR,"and then Patrick exclaiming ""WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE!?"""
05-06-2018T00:05:02,CrRAR,also *your
05-06-2018T00:05:40,CrRAR,...maybe an out of place Frankindoodle somewhere amongst them
05-06-2018T00:05:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"So while this is gonna slim them down a little, they‚Äôre going from ‚Äúnormal‚Äù to ‚Äúathletic‚Äù"
05-06-2018T00:05:56,CrRAR,nice
05-06-2018T00:06:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm just gonna be happy to use stairs without dying
05-06-2018T00:06:41,CrRAR,"Tom throws in a troll bat character, ""Nibbly, early on, was actually a BAT!"""
05-06-2018T00:06:58,CrRAR,"chat: ""OOOOOO! AHHHH!"""
05-06-2018T00:07:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Aw a widdle baby Nibbly bat
05-06-2018T00:07:09,unsteddyphoenix,"""bat nibbly as a keidran request"""
05-06-2018T00:07:14,CrRAR,XD
05-06-2018T00:07:18,unsteddyphoenix,Stairs are pretty useful
05-06-2018T00:07:54,CrRAR,I might actually request a bat nibbly just to see Sythe's reaction.
05-06-2018T00:08:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Plot twist: Sythe‚Äôs only fear turns out to be bats
05-06-2018T00:08:24,CrRAR,"""RUN AWAYYY~"" *yipeyipeyipe*"
05-06-2018T00:08:48,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúNope. Haven‚Äôt had my shots yet.‚Äù
05-06-2018T00:11:09,CrRAR,"Alright, well that's it for me."
05-06-2018T00:11:19,CrRAR,Goodnight fellow denizens of the night~
05-06-2018T00:11:32,CrRAR,(and time zone tricksters)

05-06-2018T00:12:59,CrRAR,\m/
05-06-2018T00:13:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve been thinking on my sketch request
05-06-2018T00:14:06,unsteddyphoenix,mhmm?
05-06-2018T00:14:15,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúEric boops Kat. She is not amused‚Äù
05-06-2018T00:14:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Not sure if she‚Äôs tackle him or just give him an annoyed look
05-06-2018T00:15:10,unsteddyphoenix,sounds cute~
05-06-2018T00:15:33,unsteddyphoenix,"Though, knowing Tom, Eric might just boop her without even paying attention to her and that's why she's upset."
05-06-2018T00:16:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause it‚Äôs either that or ‚ÄúNibs steals Nat‚Äôs wraps; Nat & Keith investigate and catch Nibs doing ribbon ballet‚Äù
05-06-2018T00:16:42,unsteddyphoenix,lol thats so good~
05-06-2018T00:17:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Or like three others. Though one‚Äôs a bit more of a smartass suggestion
05-06-2018T00:18:22,unsteddyphoenix,"yeah I have a bunch, and most of them silly."
05-06-2018T00:18:32,SiliconCarbide,I'd go with the Kat suggestion.
05-06-2018T00:18:36,SiliconCarbide,sounds cute
05-06-2018T00:19:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I can imagine the look on her face
05-06-2018T00:19:16,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI will kill you in your sleep‚Äù
05-06-2018T00:19:22,unsteddyphoenix,big pout~
05-06-2018T00:20:56,SiliconCarbide,i actually had a similar suggestion noted down last week ^^
05-06-2018T00:21:27,SiliconCarbide,but i left open who booped her nose for now
05-06-2018T00:22:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"When you do get your suggestion done, do you get to request another or are you out of participation or something"
05-06-2018T00:22:24,SiliconCarbide,think you are on cooldown for the month
05-06-2018T00:22:25,unsteddyphoenix,youre out until the next month
05-06-2018T00:22:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh yea
05-06-2018T00:22:45,SiliconCarbide,steddy you mentioned you are on cooldown after being coted for coloration as well?
05-06-2018T00:23:03,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah but I think for just the week after a colour
05-06-2018T00:23:24,SiliconCarbide,storymaker had 2 sketches done in april btw
05-06-2018T00:23:40,unsteddyphoenix,Some people slip through the cracks~
05-06-2018T00:23:46,unsteddyphoenix,Happens
05-06-2018T00:24:04,SiliconCarbide,ah no it was march
05-06-2018T00:26:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I may just flip a coin
05-06-2018T00:27:02,SiliconCarbide,what to suggest?
05-06-2018T00:28:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I like ‚ÄúFlora finds a ‚Äòmonstrous‚Äô spider and drafts Trace to kill it...while hiding on his back‚Äù
05-06-2018T00:28:40,SiliconCarbide,"do the right thing, suggest kat sketches!"
05-06-2018T00:29:39,unsteddyphoenix,https://i.pinimg.com/originals/40/21/35/402135032302ef6aec30d32c420729fe.jpg
05-06-2018T00:29:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Kat and Nibbly keep this train wreck rolling
05-06-2018T00:29:44,unsteddyphoenix,Spooked Flora doing this
05-06-2018T00:29:56,unsteddyphoenix,True Kat sketches are life
05-06-2018T00:30:18,SiliconCarbide,aww man that nose boop
05-06-2018T00:30:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Kinda like that yeah
05-06-2018T00:30:30,SiliconCarbide,maybe you can combine the ideas?
05-06-2018T00:31:21,SpazztasticKiwi,And Trace is just standing there like. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the size of a fly. You are a tiger. With claws.‚Äù
05-06-2018T00:31:42,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúAnd I can‚Äôt kill it with you hanging on my back‚Äù
05-06-2018T00:32:20,SiliconCarbide,hehe
05-06-2018T00:32:20,unsteddyphoenix,"""WHERE'D IT GO?? IS IT UNDER YOU? GET IT GET ITGETIT"""
05-06-2018T00:32:38,unsteddyphoenix,I know that feel Trace
05-06-2018T00:33:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚ÄúI‚Äôm GoNnA DiE, TrAcE‚Äù"
05-06-2018T00:33:35,SpazztasticKiwi,And then Nibbly wanders in and eats it
05-06-2018T00:33:51,SpazztasticKiwi,It was a stray raisin the whole time
05-06-2018T00:33:57,unsteddyphoenix,lol
05-06-2018T00:34:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Trace like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna go grey early with you‚Äù
05-06-2018T00:35:02,unsteddyphoenix,"In traces case, does he just go a lighter shade of blue :thinking:"
05-06-2018T00:35:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Pastel Trace
05-06-2018T00:37:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"When Trace gets old, he becomes the color of a powder blue Prius"
05-06-2018T00:37:29,unsteddyphoenix,makes sense to me
05-06-2018T00:38:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Having a tiger girlfriend can‚Äôt be easy though
05-06-2018T00:40:12,unsteddyphoenix,its a labor of love~
05-06-2018T00:40:27,unsteddyphoenix,There probably are some compatibility problems
05-06-2018T00:41:33,unsteddyphoenix,Think of all the hair in the drain!
05-06-2018T00:41:58,SiliconCarbide,do kiedran grow a winter coat?
05-06-2018T00:42:17,unsteddyphoenix,Most do. Kat won't due to the selective breeding.
05-06-2018T00:42:45,SiliconCarbide,wait was that confirmed somewhere?
05-06-2018T00:43:04,SiliconCarbide,that kat doesnt grow one i mean
05-06-2018T00:43:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"I was thinking of the claw problem. She does get spooked and jump on Trace‚Äôs back, he‚Äôs gonna experience amateur acupuncture"
05-06-2018T00:43:06,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah Tom has mentioned it before
05-06-2018T00:43:20,SiliconCarbide,alright
05-06-2018T00:43:59,unsteddyphoenix,Eh worth it~
05-06-2018T00:46:29,SiliconCarbide,"well i gotta go, you have fun, see ya!"
05-06-2018T00:46:39,SpazztasticKiwi,:ptv-greetings:
05-06-2018T00:46:48,unsteddyphoenix,later
05-06-2018T01:03:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom you taking any time off for your birthday
05-06-2018T01:03:40,Twokinds,Nope
05-06-2018T01:04:04,unsteddyphoenix,Planning anything special?
05-06-2018T01:04:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Not even for a birthday milkshake
05-06-2018T01:05:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt acknowledge it, it doesn‚Äôt happen‚Äù"
05-06-2018T01:08:51,Dadrobit,"Be back in a bit, gotta go get tacos before Wednesday."
05-06-2018T01:09:08,unsteddyphoenix,wouldnt make sense otherwise
05-06-2018T01:10:13,Dadrobit,I made a promise to myself and I intend to keep it.
05-06-2018T01:10:23,Dadrobit,"Also, I need to get away from my homework for a bit...."
05-06-2018T01:11:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera just tapped me on the shoulder and I‚Äôm not sure what to make of it
05-06-2018T01:12:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Food
05-06-2018T01:12:51,unsteddyphoenix,correct
05-06-2018T01:13:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt mind, pass the bowl over here‚Äù"
05-06-2018T01:13:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Gentlemenly cat

05-06-2018T01:14:57,unsteddyphoenix,esteemed gentleman
05-06-2018T01:15:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve already considered getting him a bow tie - don‚Äôt tempt me
05-06-2018T01:15:47,unsteddyphoenix,Imagine how dapper he'd look~
05-06-2018T01:18:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I do have a few bow tie hair bows...
05-06-2018T01:27:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Think I‚Äôll just take him to a pet store and see what I find
05-06-2018T01:28:34,unsteddyphoenix,Pics if you find cute stuff~
05-06-2018T01:30:07,Dadrobit,Erichberto's aquired.
05-06-2018T01:30:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Nearest pet store is 38 miles away
05-06-2018T01:39:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Anyone else got tacos for Tuesday
05-06-2018T01:40:04,Dadrobit,Maybe the folks in the van in front of me?
05-06-2018T01:40:13,Dadrobit,Unconfirmed however.
05-06-2018T02:01:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Think I‚Äôm gonna get me a salad
05-06-2018T02:04:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Nm got a banana üçå
05-06-2018T02:23:02,unsteddyphoenix,what a dramatic saga
05-06-2018T02:30:27,Dadrobit,I'm waiting on the direct to VHS blockbuster of it to come out.
05-06-2018T02:39:24,SpazztasticKiwi,What‚Äôs a VHS
05-06-2018T02:40:50,unsteddyphoenix,.
05-06-2018T02:42:00,Dadrobit,I mean...
05-06-2018T02:46:10,Dadrobit,It's kind of odd to think that we are coming up on a time where legal adults will legitimately be asking that question.
05-06-2018T02:47:43,Dadrobit,They've been the preferred version of home video for 15-ish years now.
05-06-2018T02:48:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I was kidding
05-06-2018T02:48:43,Dadrobit,"Oh, I know, but it's soon gonna be a legitimate question."
05-06-2018T02:49:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt live under a rock like *some* people
05-06-2018T02:49:07,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe it already is
05-06-2018T02:50:07,unsteddyphoenix,Wonder if the 13 year olds on here know what it is
05-06-2018T02:50:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I know it‚Äôs already a thing. Video is digital now - even DVDs aren‚Äôt terribly necessary anymore to watch something
05-06-2018T02:51:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Don‚Äôt be mentioning 13 year olds. HE will come back
05-06-2018T02:51:41,unsteddyphoenix,lol. it summons them from the fortnite abyss
05-06-2018T02:51:43,unsteddyphoenix,mb
05-06-2018T02:51:59,Dadrobit,Which one? There are a dozen of em?
05-06-2018T02:52:39,Dadrobit,I wonder if Red ever got back into art?
05-06-2018T02:52:59,Dadrobit,River Jazz Hermina
05-06-2018T02:53:13,Dadrobit,"Of Huntsville, AL"
05-06-2018T02:53:28,unsteddyphoenix,hahaha
05-06-2018T02:53:37,unsteddyphoenix,Are you the hacker known as 4chan?
05-06-2018T02:53:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Giving Huntsville a bad name
05-06-2018T02:54:05,Dadrobit,"Oh man, the PM's I got from that kid after I found his mother."
05-06-2018T02:54:13,Dadrobit,Priceless.
05-06-2018T02:54:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I need details
05-06-2018T02:54:57,Dadrobit,Kid was giving personal details out on the internet and was claiming to be a white hat hacker at the same time.
05-06-2018T02:55:27,Dadrobit,So I did a bit of sleuthing in the areas that he mentioned and found some probable connections.
05-06-2018T02:55:51,unsteddyphoenix,We kept telling him to stop posting personal information and h ekept doing it
05-06-2018T02:56:06,Dadrobit,I slipped a couple hints of family names into conversation until I got a reaction and knew I struck gold.
05-06-2018T02:56:06,SpazztasticKiwi,No ban hammer üî®?
05-06-2018T02:56:39,unsteddyphoenix,"Nah. Tom never bans and Sage only bans after like 50 ""warnings"""
05-06-2018T02:57:01,Dadrobit,"Nah, I just gave him a good talking to and he promised not to be so frivolous with personal information in the future."
05-06-2018T02:57:01,unsteddyphoenix,Which is probably we he has such a reputation
05-06-2018T02:57:41,Dadrobit,Then he kind of fell away from the chat.
05-06-2018T02:58:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Kids act like more than what they are until reality bites their ass
05-06-2018T02:59:48,Dadrobit,"Had a suspicion it was he renamed himself to be Dragon/Trev when he showed up fairly soon after RedDeath2018 went away, but I think their mannerisms are just a wee bit too different."
05-06-2018T03:00:56,Dadrobit,That sentence was going in two places at once in the beginning there. My bad.
05-06-2018T03:01:02,SpazztasticKiwi,The most annoying thing I run into is those teenagers with the ‚Äúmy friend wants your number‚Äù mess
05-06-2018T03:02:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve come across one irritating me once. Ignored him
05-06-2018T03:02:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Next time I saw him he was with a woman who was likely his mom
05-06-2018T03:02:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Not a word
05-06-2018T03:07:48,SpazztasticKiwi,That kinda reminds me I got a wrong number the other day
05-06-2018T03:08:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I answer it and this lady on the other end is like ‚ÄúMom?‚Äù
05-06-2018T03:19:24,Dadrobit,"Good lord. I am watching a documentary on this guy named Chris-Chan and I am legitimately horrified. Like, blood turned to ice, pit in my stomach horrified."
05-06-2018T03:21:07,Dadrobit,"Currently in the midst of the 3rd episode of 11, each one is 30-40 minutes long giving a truly utterly comprehensive analysis of this person as he grew and transformed into what he is now."
05-06-2018T03:22:04,Dadrobit,It's scary how well put together the series is. There is frankly a flabbergasting amount of information that is being cited here.
05-06-2018T03:22:11,unsteddyphoenix,Oh I LOVE Chris-chan. What a phenomenon.
05-06-2018T03:22:25,unsteddyphoenix,How the hell did he get on tv so many times.
05-06-2018T03:22:28,unsteddyphoenix,It's insane
05-06-2018T03:22:52,unsteddyphoenix,"His entire life is documented, mostly by him."
05-06-2018T03:26:56,Dadrobit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Aiv66DEGjE
05-06-2018T03:28:50,Dadrobit,"Episode 3 and he's still only 22-23. In the middle of watching his family Christmas where he ""gifts"" his family just.... crap.... And is wishing for Santa to bring him a boyfriend free girlfriend."
05-06-2018T03:28:52,unsteddyphoenix,oh my god theres 4 parts
05-06-2018T03:29:02,Dadrobit,There are 11 parts so far.
05-06-2018T03:29:09,unsteddyphoenix,oh no oh dear
05-06-2018T03:29:26,Dadrobit,The director of the documentary is estimating 15 before he is able to catch up.
05-06-2018T03:29:51,Dadrobit,The level of detail this goes into is sickening.
05-06-2018T03:30:34,unsteddyphoenix,It boggles the mind
05-06-2018T03:30:50,Dadrobit,"Reading responses he made on his middle school exams. Looking at how he perceived his childhood ""gal-pals"" that were actually just girls his father paid off to pretend to be friends..."
05-06-2018T03:31:11,unsteddyphoenix,The amount of INFORMATION about him is just...completely absurd.
05-06-2018T03:32:00,Dadrobit,The suspicious white stain down his jeans on his 18th birthday. The last time he would actually be with his gal-pals.
05-06-2018T03:32:20,Dadrobit,This shit wants to be on Netflix.
05-06-2018T03:33:11,Dadrobit,"It start off really fucking sad actually. Like, heartrendingly sad to hear how he was raised."
05-06-2018T03:33:15,Dadrobit,starts*
05-06-2018T03:34:13,Dadrobit,But you get to see how he slowly descended from his innocent naivety into his current state of.... Whatever the Hell is going on in there.
05-06-2018T03:37:22,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah despite his upbringing and his mental disorder(s), he's really not a good person."
05-06-2018T03:37:32,unsteddyphoenix,"Hasnt he like, assaulted people and things"
05-06-2018T03:38:26,Dadrobit,Pepper sprayed a GameStop clerk because Sonic Boom changed Sonic's arms to a different color.
05-06-2018T03:38:57,Dadrobit,Also tried running over the owner of a game shop he used to go to as a young adult until he got a perma ban.
05-06-2018T03:39:14,Dadrobit,Though he blames his mother for that. Says that she grabbed the wheel.
05-06-2018T03:40:02,Dadrobit,Plus several accounts of sexual assault from the trolls that have tried dating him for the lulz.
05-06-2018T03:42:18,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah
05-06-2018T03:53:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll see you tomorrow
05-06-2018T03:53:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm goin on to bed
05-06-2018T03:53:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Night
05-06-2018T03:54:01,Dadrobit,"Pokemon's Giovanni and Sonic's Dr. Robotnik team up to create their own Sonichu, but they accidentally spill in Cherry Cola and they instead got Black Sonichu."
05-06-2018T03:54:13,Dadrobit,"Holy shit, it's accidentally hilarious."
05-06-2018T03:54:25,Dadrobit,"Night, Spazz."
05-06-2018T04:09:36,unsteddyphoenix,CHEMICAL CHERRY COLA
05-06-2018T04:10:14,Dadrobit,X-actly.
05-06-2018T04:23:21,Dadrobit,"Man, it hurts. Looking at the things he does, you can see how close he was. How he totally could have been a functional contributor to society. If he was just able to differentiate between his imaginations and respect the demands of reality..."
05-06-2018T04:24:55,Dadrobit,"Like, there's a spark there for a while. A determination that countless other folks lack that he squanders on blurring the lines of his reality."
05-06-2018T04:28:21,unsteddyphoenix,Idk. I feel like he was most likely doomed from the get go
05-06-2018T04:28:30,unsteddyphoenix,Though what did happen was...far  beyond whats nromal
05-06-2018T04:30:58,Dadrobit,"I'm not saying he's a savant or anything, but maybe with a better upbringing..."
05-06-2018T04:31:39,Dadrobit,"Going through this, I feel like there's a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy that he cursed himself with."
05-06-2018T04:32:34,Dadrobit,"That he was intelligent enough to know that he was never going to be intelligent, so he never tried and his environment never pushed against that notion."
05-06-2018T04:32:56,Dadrobit,So he never got past being a junior high kid.
05-06-2018T04:34:29,Dadrobit,"Any time an authority figure challenged him or his actions, mommy and daddy were there to save the day and maintain the status quo."
05-06-2018T04:35:49,Dadrobit,"From the teachers at his schools to the police arresting him for loitering soliciting girlfriends at Walmart, they never let him see consequence."
05-06-2018T04:37:01,Dadrobit,So he sees his actions as right as he's never conclusively been shown to be wrong.
05-06-2018T04:37:34,Dadrobit,Therefore the actions of a disorderly 13 year old are just as valid at 35 or however old he is.
05-06-2018T04:48:48,Dadrobit,"I'm having trouble piecing together my thoughts, but from what I see, a huge part of his problems was not the autism itself, it is the unchallenged narcissism. That is not a result of autism, that is a result of nonstop coddling and enabling."
05-06-2018T04:52:08,Dadrobit,The narcissism was allowed to fester in his mind and became the delusion he lives by.
05-06-2018T04:55:33,Dadrobit,"Autism in and of itself is a helluva handicap, but pair it up with a deeply instilled delusion of society, and you get the hyper-extremes like Chris Chan I think."
05-06-2018T04:58:43,unsteddyphoenix,"He's sort of like a big metaphor for the whole ""cultural marxism"" thing"
05-06-2018T04:58:54,unsteddyphoenix,The worst of millenials taken to the extreme
05-06-2018T04:59:06,unsteddyphoenix,He could only exist in our generation
05-06-2018T05:02:04,Dadrobit,Ever read The Glass Menagerie? 1944 play about a family that lives in various levels of self delusion.
05-06-2018T05:03:45,Dadrobit,Most prominent of them being the girl with a physical handicap that she ended up forging into a complete inferiority complex and general mental fragility.
05-06-2018T05:04:31,Dadrobit,"So she spends her days with her mother idly chatting and dreaming of all the ""gentleman callers"" that will one day waltz through their front door."
05-06-2018T05:05:47,Dadrobit,"And when she's not, she's lost in her own little world that shes created with her glass figurines."
05-06-2018T05:05:58,Dadrobit,she's*
05-06-2018T05:09:45,Dadrobit,"The concept of utterly delusional shut-ins and outcasts unwittingly generated by their family is certainly not a new one. But Chris Chan is probably the closest thing we can achieve to perfect, grand crazy in real life without being literally Norman Bates"
05-06-2018T05:15:36,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah there's tons of lesser examples
05-06-2018T05:15:42,unsteddyphoenix,See: 4chan
05-06-2018T05:16:04,unsteddyphoenix,But Chris-chan is the beautiful like...chaos theory-tier disaster
05-06-2018T05:16:15,unsteddyphoenix,Where the worst possible things for his development occured to him
05-06-2018T05:16:22,unsteddyphoenix,While at the same time all being public
05-06-2018T05:16:51,unsteddyphoenix,Between all the times he got on TV and his internet fame...
05-06-2018T05:17:12,unsteddyphoenix,His slow descent can and has been picked apart and analysed
05-06-2018T05:17:26,unsteddyphoenix,"It's honestly hard to think of him as a real person and not like, a character from something"
05-06-2018T05:23:05,Dadrobit,Perhaps because he legitimately believes he is a part of his character's universe? And everything that he's ever done with Sonicu and pals is just plagarism.
05-06-2018T05:23:50,Dadrobit,"So he's living the life that he identifies with: A series of TV, cartoon, and movie tropes."
05-06-2018T05:26:26,Dadrobit,"Also, my allusion to Norman Bates is a rather unfortunate one. I fear the the possibility of his mother dying from living in their own filth and him being so deep into his own world that he just continues to live as if nothing is wrong is dishearteningly"
05-06-2018T05:26:29,Dadrobit,very real.
05-06-2018T05:26:36,unsteddyphoenix,"I cant even fathom what he must think. I imagine he must fluctuate between levels of lucidity; sometimes believing he's his self-insert, sometimes being aware of reality, and every state inbetween."
05-06-2018T05:27:02,unsteddyphoenix,Though it's hard for me to accept that someone could be so completely deluded to actually live inside their own fiction
05-06-2018T05:27:44,unsteddyphoenix,"Especially when it's a bizzare smattering of other media mashed together, how does he fill in details like..."
05-06-2018T05:28:20,unsteddyphoenix,So he's still living with his mother in the exact same way?
05-06-2018T05:28:30,unsteddyphoenix,How has he not been institutionalised
05-06-2018T05:28:54,Dadrobit,"This is a guy that sits in Wal-Mart with a giant sign dictating the traits he finds acceptable in women and truly, HONESTLY believes that everyone else has conspired against him to prevent boyfriend-free girls from coming to him."
05-06-2018T05:29:33,Dadrobit,And his sign holding days of conspiracy theory are long before the internet got a hold of him.
05-06-2018T05:29:40,unsteddyphoenix,Didnt he did that in a university too
05-06-2018T05:29:53,Dadrobit,"Yes, he hung up signs and passed out flyers."
05-06-2018T05:30:30,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, there's a difference between extreme paranoia and hyper-delusion"
05-06-2018T05:30:33,Dadrobit,The dean of the university that tried to force him to stop eventually became the main antagonist of all of his sonichu cartoons.
05-06-2018T05:30:48,unsteddyphoenix,"You dont need to know the details of how ""THEY"" are doing this to you"
05-06-2018T05:31:32,unsteddyphoenix,But creating a world and living in it...how do you maintain that level of insanity
05-06-2018T05:31:41,unsteddyphoenix,Non-sustainable madness
05-06-2018T05:31:54,unsteddyphoenix,It fucks me up
05-06-2018T05:32:10,Dadrobit,Many of his Sonichu booklets had mini-series that were self inserts of him fighting off the Jerkops and their quest to prevent him form finding love.
05-06-2018T05:32:20,unsteddyphoenix,Kerkops lmao
05-06-2018T05:32:29,unsteddyphoenix,Jerk*
05-06-2018T05:32:32,unsteddyphoenix,Thats so good
05-06-2018T05:32:44,Dadrobit,"""Jerkops"" being the police and mall security that would kick him out and or arrest him from time to time."
05-06-2018T05:34:38,unsteddyphoenix,He was SO close to getting a gf before the jerkops interfered :/
05-06-2018T05:34:57,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao the fliers...
05-06-2018T05:35:08,unsteddyphoenix,His criteria for women killed me
05-06-2018T05:35:23,Dadrobit,"I mean, I think it's like you said. It's the perfect storm. Mix up his congenital abnormality with his insane upbringing, and we have what we have."
05-06-2018T05:36:12,Dadrobit,"I mean, I can't even begin to imagine what life would be like for me if even the aspect of the paid-off ""gal pals"" were a part of my life."
05-06-2018T05:36:33,unsteddyphoenix,"True, that would fuck anyone up, autism or no"
05-06-2018T05:36:51,Dadrobit,"Like, he went through his entire youth, without a single friend that wasn't paid for by his father."
05-06-2018T05:36:55,Dadrobit,Fuck man....
05-06-2018T05:39:07,unsteddyphoenix,Didnt have a chance
05-06-2018T05:39:19,Bgrmystr2,I can't imagine living that kinda lif
05-06-2018T05:39:21,Bgrmystr2,e
05-06-2018T05:39:23,Bgrmystr2,"also, hi"
05-06-2018T05:39:27,Dadrobit,o/
05-06-2018T05:39:28,unsteddyphoenix,yo
05-06-2018T05:39:34,Bgrmystr2,Just watched Guardians of the Galaxy 2
05-06-2018T05:39:46,unsteddyphoenix,Oh yeah I still have to see that
05-06-2018T05:39:54,unsteddyphoenix,One of the few I havent seen at this point
05-06-2018T05:40:17,Dadrobit,I had mixed feelings about it.
05-06-2018T05:41:42,unsteddyphoenix,yeah? not as good as the first?
05-06-2018T05:41:52,unsteddyphoenix,Lack of dance numbers probably hurt it
05-06-2018T05:42:09,Dadrobit,"It tried too hard to be funny on darn near every frame of the movie, so when it tried coming off as serious in some parts, it just felt too off, too contrasting a tone to take seriously."
05-06-2018T05:42:36,Dadrobit,"Still a fun movie, but not as good as the first imo."
05-06-2018T05:42:41,Xexanoth,great bad guy though
05-06-2018T05:42:44,Bgrmystr2,yeh seemed like that to me too. some of the serious parts were funny tho
05-06-2018T05:43:05,Dadrobit,Mary Poppins was fantastic in that movie.
05-06-2018T05:43:10,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno if I'd dock it too much, but I don't expect much of anything from marvel movies"
05-06-2018T05:43:18,Bgrmystr2,Fuck yeah Mary Poppins was the best.
05-06-2018T05:44:10,Bgrmystr2,I think Poppins might have been my favorite
05-06-2018T05:44:15,Bgrmystr2,And leave it at that
05-06-2018T05:44:20,Dadrobit,"Antagonist was actually kind of a sticking point for me. No spoilers, but it ended up not sitting well with me."
05-06-2018T05:44:47,Dadrobit,"I liked it, but I felt it could have maybe been handled better."
05-06-2018T05:44:59,Bgrmystr2,hm. mayvbe
05-06-2018T05:45:20,unsteddyphoenix,Mary Poppins...
05-06-2018T05:45:27,Dadrobit,"I loved his lead in, but his motives and methods were meh."
05-06-2018T05:45:42,unsteddyphoenix,"eveyrone was like ""Black Panther has the BEST VILLIAN"" but when I saw it I was underwhelmed."
05-06-2018T05:46:11,unsteddyphoenix,For basically the same reason
05-06-2018T05:46:13,Dadrobit,Black Panther had a Sick trap beat tho
05-06-2018T05:46:28,unsteddyphoenix,Black panther soundtrack is :fire::fire::fire::fire::fire::fire:
05-06-2018T05:46:33,unsteddyphoenix,Apart from...that one song.
05-06-2018T05:47:28,Dadrobit,"And yeah, hard agree on Black Panther antagonist."
05-06-2018T05:47:38,Bgrmystr2,will prolly watch that later
05-06-2018T05:50:54,Bgrmystr2,gonna head to sleep since it's near 6am
05-06-2018T05:51:17,unsteddyphoenix,Oo. Yeah i'll accept that. gnight.
05-06-2018T05:51:31,unsteddyphoenix,hide from the sun
05-06-2018T05:52:18,Dadrobit,About 4am here.
05-06-2018T05:52:36,Dadrobit,No tacos left.
05-06-2018T05:52:46,unsteddyphoenix,4am tacos are best tacos tho :/
05-06-2018T05:53:00,Dadrobit,It is no longer Taco Tuesday tho
05-06-2018T05:53:29,Dadrobit,"Also, those are some damned expensive tacos I got."
05-06-2018T05:53:41,Dadrobit,Could only afford a few at a time.
05-06-2018T05:53:58,Dadrobit,Ramen for a week for my taco expenditures.
05-06-2018T05:56:53,unsteddyphoenix,Haha

05-06-2018T06:00:23,Dadrobit,Yep still with Mama
05-06-2018T06:00:52,unsteddyphoenix,the fuck was that
05-06-2018T06:00:55,unsteddyphoenix,shoutout?
05-06-2018T06:00:58,unsteddyphoenix,WHYTHO
05-06-2018T06:01:00,Dadrobit,A troll donated money to him under the name Adam Lanza.
05-06-2018T06:01:32,Dadrobit,So he got his mother to do a shoutout to Adam Lanza.
05-06-2018T06:02:57,unsteddyphoenix,He gets $488 from his patreon
05-06-2018T06:02:58,Dadrobit,Adam Lanza being the same name as the guy who murdered a bunch of kids and teachers a few years back at Sandy Hook Elementary School.
05-06-2018T06:02:59,unsteddyphoenix,ugh
05-06-2018T06:03:06,unsteddyphoenix,ohh that
05-06-2018T06:05:24,Dadrobit,Fuck. I'm going to have to go to sleep with this topic in mind...
05-06-2018T06:05:42,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
05-06-2018T06:06:12,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh nothing like some late night chrischan before bed
05-06-2018T06:06:23,unsteddyphoenix,I wish you no dreams
05-06-2018T06:07:19,Dadrobit,Much appreciated.
05-06-2018T06:07:34,Dadrobit,I have no one but myself to blame.
05-06-2018T06:08:14,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, this was a poor judgement call on your part"
05-06-2018T06:08:18,unsteddyphoenix,But I dont blame you
05-06-2018T06:08:26,unsteddyphoenix,The chris-chan rabbit hole is alluring
05-06-2018T06:08:36,unsteddyphoenix,"Like a trainwreck, you just cant look away"
05-06-2018T06:08:51,Dadrobit,In slow motion.
05-06-2018T06:08:57,Dadrobit,Over the course of years.
05-06-2018T06:09:20,Dadrobit,I guess that'd actually be at high speed then....
05-06-2018T06:09:51,Dadrobit,Just... A never ending train wreck that just gets worse and worse.
05-06-2018T06:10:07,unsteddyphoenix,and it dont stop crashign
05-06-2018T06:16:59,Dadrobit,"Oh, he's a giant homophobe? Oh he stopped being straight? And now he's identifying as a woman? And now he cut open his own taint to make himself a vulva, claiming it came in from advanced self hypnosis from subliminal frequency videos on Youtube?"
05-06-2018T06:17:06,Dadrobit,It really doesn't fucking stop.
05-06-2018T06:17:52,unsteddyphoenix,Isnt he also racist? I feel like he only wanted to date white girls
05-06-2018T06:17:56,unsteddyphoenix,Or something
05-06-2018T06:18:07,Dadrobit,"Yeah, he's tossed around slurs."
05-06-2018T06:18:23,Dadrobit,The homophobia and racism came from the father.
05-06-2018T06:18:36,unsteddyphoenix,god.
05-06-2018T06:18:54,unsteddyphoenix,he's...it's really a spectacle
05-06-2018T06:19:10,Dadrobit,"Possibly the mother, but prank calls to the house resulted in the father getting irate enough at the ethnic pranksters to make some serious statements."
05-06-2018T06:19:29,unsteddyphoenix,"In a way, im glad he exists. It makes for an unbelievable story"
05-06-2018T06:19:36,unsteddyphoenix,I feel like historians will study him.
05-06-2018T06:20:49,Dadrobit,He's probably inspired a number of budding psychologists to pursue that field of study already.
05-06-2018T06:21:05,Dadrobit,"Honestly, it's fascinating enough."
05-06-2018T06:21:23,Dadrobit,I could totally see it being the origin story for at least a few people's desires.
05-06-2018T06:23:42,unsteddyphoenix,"You were right, netflix needs to slide in on this"
05-06-2018T06:37:58,Dadrobit,"""After not winning the contest, Chris immediately wrote a strongly capitalized email to Sony."""
05-06-2018T06:38:08,Dadrobit,"O shit, I'm dying."
05-06-2018T06:38:23,unsteddyphoenix,lmao go to bed
05-06-2018T06:38:27,unsteddyphoenix,this cant be healthy
05-06-2018T06:38:50,Dadrobit,Just.... Just one more episode....
05-06-2018T06:49:49,Dadrobit,"Oh shit, 4chan finally discovered him."
05-06-2018T06:49:58,unsteddyphoenix,dun dunnn
05-06-2018T07:00:24,Dadrobit,"Okay, I'm done. Time for bed."
05-06-2018T07:00:38,unsteddyphoenix,Its 12am here
05-06-2018T07:00:43,unsteddyphoenix,This is not a time for americans to be awake
05-06-2018T07:00:46,Dadrobit,I'll just sleep away the hottest part of the day.
05-06-2018T07:00:53,unsteddyphoenix,Shit actually true
05-06-2018T07:01:05,Dadrobit,5am here. Most Americans are waking up right now.
05-06-2018T07:01:15,unsteddyphoenix,Most americans wake up at 5am?
05-06-2018T07:01:22,unsteddyphoenix,Reality is terrifying
05-06-2018T07:01:30,Dadrobit,On the East coast it's like 7 already.
05-06-2018T07:01:35,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh right

05-06-2018T15:11:28,TheGamePlayer,In thinking of giving up art and returning to being a musician.
05-06-2018T15:15:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I kinda want to google that flower but I‚Äôm also kinda afraid to
05-06-2018T15:16:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, maybe he‚Äôs named after a flower that‚Äôs exclusively in the TK world"

05-06-2018T16:44:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"But why‚Äôs it called cockscomb, and is it important that the picture is showing ‚Äúcockscomb seeds‚Äù"

05-06-2018T17:12:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not sure if the truck I just saw was supposed to have front tires sitting at an angle or if he needed a mechanic
05-06-2018T17:20:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll be back in a few hours ‚úåüèª

05-06-2018T19:23:55,CrRAR,sounds like a broken tie rod
05-06-2018T19:39:32,CrRAR,whoa is it just me or is the chat... like... looping? &gt;:
05-06-2018T20:24:51,Twokinds,lol
05-06-2018T20:25:02,Twokinds,Suddenly there's just a bunch of howling outside my house
05-06-2018T20:31:36,unsteddyphoenix,Somebody started a howl :0

05-06-2018T20:34:21,CrRAR,Do these howls happen frequently?
05-06-2018T21:18:57,Twokinds,No which is why it's odd.
05-06-2018T21:19:01,Twokinds,It was a lot of howling.
05-06-2018T21:20:25,Bgrmystr2,awooo~? &gt;o&lt;
05-06-2018T21:31:28,Twokinds,No awoo

05-06-2018T21:32:20,unsteddyphoenix,I feel like it used to be more severe
05-06-2018T21:32:50,unsteddyphoenix,It's a different economic awoo landscape now...
05-06-2018T21:32:58,Bgrmystr2,can't force me to pay it &gt;:U
05-06-2018T21:50:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"If it‚Äôs ‚Äúawoo‚Äù, it‚Äôs likely wolves"
05-06-2018T21:51:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Coyotes go ‚Äúahhh‚Äù
05-06-2018T21:52:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Did the dogs sound the alarm

05-06-2018T22:35:31,Twokinds,Had an eyelash in my eye
05-06-2018T22:35:59,Twokinds,"Went to rub my eye, forgot I'd been eating hotwings..."
05-06-2018T22:36:14,unsteddyphoenix,Betrayed by your last line of defense
05-06-2018T22:36:20,unsteddyphoenix,Oh god.
05-06-2018T22:36:31,BadFoMo,Sorry.
05-06-2018T22:36:35,unsteddyphoenix,What is this a sitcom
05-06-2018T22:37:28,BadFoMo,said as he laughed a little.
05-06-2018T22:37:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Do you need an adult or something
05-06-2018T22:40:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"You slam your fingernail in the window, twist your ankle getting out of your chair, and now this"
05-06-2018T22:40:45,unsteddyphoenix,How could this DAY get any WORSE
05-06-2018T22:40:50,unsteddyphoenix,*looks at camera*
05-06-2018T22:41:04,Bgrmystr2,*audience laughter trackk*
05-06-2018T22:41:26,unsteddyphoenix,*starts raining*
05-06-2018T22:42:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Be happy you don‚Äôt wear contacts. Something gets in your eye then you have to dig them out and then clean your eye.
05-06-2018T22:42:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Plus you gotta flush the contact before putting it back in
05-06-2018T22:44:04,unsteddyphoenix,I read this story recently where a surgeon had to extract 17 contact lenses from this womans eye
05-06-2018T22:44:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"Do know that I‚Äôm concerned, I swear. I‚Äôm just gonna laugh while I ask if you‚Äôre ok"
05-06-2018T22:45:30,unsteddyphoenix,I hope for your swift recovery
05-06-2018T22:46:23,SpazztasticKiwi,RIP right/left eye - whichever one. A cold press will help the urge to keep rubbing and take some pain away
05-06-2018T23:20:11,Bgrmystr2,17 contact lenses from an eye?
05-06-2018T23:20:14,Bgrmystr2,a single eye?
05-06-2018T23:20:17,Bgrmystr2,holy shit due
05-06-2018T23:20:19,Bgrmystr2,dude* even
05-06-2018T23:21:21,unsteddyphoenix,"Actually, turns out they found 17 initially, but it turns out there were actually 10 more than that found later."
05-06-2018T23:21:29,unsteddyphoenix,So 27 in a single eye
05-06-2018T23:21:54,unsteddyphoenix,turns out
05-06-2018T23:24:47,Bgrmystr2,woooooow what the crap
05-06-2018T23:24:52,Bgrmystr2,how old was she?
05-06-2018T23:24:54,Bgrmystr2,and why
05-06-2018T23:25:01,Bgrmystr2,why the fuck
05-06-2018T23:25:20,unsteddyphoenix,She was pretty old. They found it while preparing to do cataract surgery
05-06-2018T23:25:27,unsteddyphoenix,She thought the discomfort was just old age lol
05-06-2018T23:25:28,Bgrmystr2,that's why
05-06-2018T23:26:31,Bgrmystr2,"exactly as I thought, old age, less accurate nerves, and she forgot to take it out prolly"
05-06-2018T23:27:03,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno how she managed though, I mean.. you'd have one contact in your eye and one contact not in.. it's like having one lens missing from your glasses"
05-06-2018T23:27:07,Bgrmystr2,you gonna have a bad time..
05-06-2018T23:52:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Everyone looks the same when I don‚Äôt have my contacts in - fuzzy
05-06-2018T23:54:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I walk around with my eyes squinted like I‚Äôm suspicious of everything
05-06-2018T23:59:42,unsteddyphoenix,"""which of these blobs might injure me"""
