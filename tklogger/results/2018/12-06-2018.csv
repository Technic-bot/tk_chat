12-06-2018T11:28:33,SykezWolf,Hi. Anyone know where comic pages without speech bubbles can be found? ^^

12-06-2018T11:47:47,SykezWolf,Oh. I found it. If anyone else want it: http://kindamoody.com/versions/
12-06-2018T11:50:04,iliar,This thing was created to help translators. I think people who are engaged in translation know about this topic. https://www.twokinds.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=15639
12-06-2018T11:51:28,iliar,http://twokindscomic.com/speechless/ - speechless version of comic pages
12-06-2018T11:56:03,SykezWolf,Thank you :D
12-06-2018T16:20:25,JamesBSquirrel3,"Ooo:ptv-unimpressed: What a day! You guys heard a news; People gone mad to join arise as we go forth to join EXIT from BREXIT, as Brexit crisis means crisis!:ptv-angry: Man, I tell you!"
12-06-2018T16:24:37,JamesBSquirrel3,"I'm sick for this Prime Minister - Treasey May, the tories have giving it all bonkers, I had enough everything! No offence you guys of Stream users, but its UK Brexit pointless I tell you, so I can't take it anymore! So there's my story!"
12-06-2018T16:25:48,JamesBSquirrel3,I'm off to bed to recover my Hayfever season.:ptv-grossedout::ptv-ice:
12-06-2018T16:26:16,JamesBSquirrel3,Bye folks.
12-06-2018T17:08:51,SpazztasticKiwi,üçù
12-06-2018T21:13:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Sometimes I wonder how ridiculous it is to put someone so accident prone as me around hot oil vats
12-06-2018T21:17:09,SpazztasticKiwi,And I‚Äôve half decided to forget Comic Con and go to San Diego for the sole purpose of visiting the Cat Cafe
12-06-2018T21:25:46,unsteddyphoenix,I wanna go to a cat cafe so bad~
12-06-2018T21:26:03,unsteddyphoenix,One of the main motivations to get a gf tbh
12-06-2018T21:27:17,Twokinds,Not me. I'm allergic.
12-06-2018T21:28:31,TheBeckoner,"If you get a girlfriend, then you can go to the cafe?"
12-06-2018T21:31:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Girlfriend wouldn‚Äôt take his allergy away
12-06-2018T21:32:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Wrong person
12-06-2018T21:32:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve seen some reviews and apparently one rule is you can‚Äôt pick up the cats
12-06-2018T21:33:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd be the one person in the corner table having a conversation with a half-asleep calico
12-06-2018T21:41:20,CrRAR,"Hahaha, that's a fantastic mental picture."
12-06-2018T21:42:51,CrRAR,Meanwhile steam comfortingly rises off a freshly poured cappaccino~
12-06-2018T21:44:16,unsteddyphoenix,"So tom can't be my girlfriend, ah well"
12-06-2018T21:44:44,unsteddyphoenix,I guess picking them up could be problematic
12-06-2018T21:45:48,CrRAR,The cats... or the vats?
12-06-2018T21:46:48,unsteddyphoenix,The...yes
12-06-2018T21:48:00,CrRAR,xD
12-06-2018T22:04:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you manage to pick up one of those oil vats, I‚Äôd be slightly worried. They‚Äôre kinda attached to the entire fryer"
12-06-2018T22:06:52,TheBeckoner,strong phoenix boi
12-06-2018T22:16:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom, I imagine that Cafe is just pure death"
12-06-2018T22:16:47,SpazztasticKiwi,For you
12-06-2018T22:18:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, who says a girlfriend, or boyfriend for that matter, is the price of admission? Ya could just plan a trip to go - it‚Äôs a tourist spot"
12-06-2018T22:31:33,unsteddyphoenix,I guess~
12-06-2018T22:36:02,Twokinds,I wonder if my bank still takes coin rolls
12-06-2018T22:39:30,unsteddyphoenix,"Arent those like, for laundry"
12-06-2018T22:40:09,Twokinds,Hm?
12-06-2018T22:40:26,Twokinds,I've heard some banks no longer take coins.
12-06-2018T22:41:11,Twokinds,"I just counted up the coins in my loose coin jar. About $75, so probably worth taking it in, if they accept it."
12-06-2018T22:42:26,unsteddyphoenix,In coins...you guys have $1 bills right? So all of those coins are under $1?
12-06-2018T22:48:11,Dadrobit,"They should be, although we do have dollar coins as well."
12-06-2018T22:48:58,Dadrobit,Personally I use a 5 gallon bucket for the coins I get.
12-06-2018T22:50:13,Dadrobit,"Unfortunately I know that my credit union doesn't take rolls anymore, it kinda blows."
12-06-2018T22:50:29,Dadrobit,Enough folks tried swindling them with blanks I guess.
12-06-2018T22:50:44,unsteddyphoenix,Why dont you guys just...use your coins?
12-06-2018T22:50:51,unsteddyphoenix,i can recommend it
12-06-2018T22:52:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Wells Fargo will exchange coins for cash even if you don‚Äôt use them
12-06-2018T22:52:07,Dadrobit,It's like having a second savings account that you don't know how much is being saved.
12-06-2018T22:52:20,Dadrobit,So it's like a fun surprise every couple of years.
12-06-2018T22:52:37,Dadrobit,Like finding a $100 bill in an old jacket.
12-06-2018T22:55:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, $75 in change - sounds fun to count"
12-06-2018T22:56:50,unsteddyphoenix,lol
12-06-2018T22:56:58,unsteddyphoenix,I...guess I can kind of get that
12-06-2018T22:57:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh and you guys want to hear about the Stupid Thing of the Week
12-06-2018T22:57:14,unsteddyphoenix,Think i'd rather just have $75 that I know about in my bank account
12-06-2018T22:57:49,Dadrobit,Get a coin counter. IT makes it considerably more fun.
12-06-2018T22:58:53,Dadrobit,"Preferably a mechanical one, so that you don't have to worry about batteries."
12-06-2018T23:00:36,unsteddyphoenix,then i'd...have less money.
12-06-2018T23:01:50,Dadrobit,Each their own I suppose.
12-06-2018T23:02:37,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs still your money. You‚Äôre just collecting the little bits after each purchase into a jar to reuse them as a larger lump sum
12-06-2018T23:03:13,SpazztasticKiwi,And so you‚Äôre not paying for a Big Mac meal with two baggies of unmarked change
12-06-2018T23:04:52,Twokinds,"Yeah, although I just throw the pennies away. Way too much effort to count those."
12-06-2018T23:05:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Get Holly to do it
12-06-2018T23:05:57,unsteddyphoenix,No dont feed pennies to Holly
12-06-2018T23:06:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt mean feed them to her
12-06-2018T23:07:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you are going to throw them away though, those em in a donation thing. Supposed to be tax deductible"
12-06-2018T23:08:01,Twokinds,eh
12-06-2018T23:08:30,Twokinds,Wish they'd just get rid of pennies already.
12-06-2018T23:09:24,SpazztasticKiwi,And then how are you gonna make a wish in the fountain
12-06-2018T23:09:38,unsteddyphoenix,its nuts that you still have them
12-06-2018T23:10:28,SpazztasticKiwi,America is allergic to change
12-06-2018T23:10:40,Twokinds,All the more reason to get rid of them.
12-06-2018T23:10:47,unsteddyphoenix,lol
12-06-2018T23:11:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm so punny
12-06-2018T23:12:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Good luck convincing anyone
12-06-2018T23:12:49,unsteddyphoenix,IS there like. Any reason to keep them
12-06-2018T23:13:04,unsteddyphoenix,Our lowest currency is 10c I think...though I dont remember last itme I saw one
12-06-2018T23:18:20,Dadrobit,"Hm, can't seem to find the sorter my father and I use for sale anywhere."
12-06-2018T23:18:40,Dadrobit,"Literally a case of ""they don't make em like they used to."""
12-06-2018T23:21:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Could be a choking hazard for the kids. Gotta ban it
12-06-2018T23:24:07,Dadrobit,It's just a giant gravity fed plastic board that has indents that automatically sort the coins
12-06-2018T23:24:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Nope. Can‚Äôt risk it
12-06-2018T23:24:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Think about the widdle ones
12-06-2018T23:26:25,Dadrobit,"If they can choke on a 1x3 foot piece of plastic, then they have more problems than a single consumer recall can fix."
12-06-2018T23:27:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"Not just choke, they could throw it, causing it to break and cut themselves on the plastic"
12-06-2018T23:28:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm sure they just stopped selling as well or something
12-06-2018T23:29:56,Dadrobit,"Oh, for sure it's discontinued, it's suuuper old."
12-06-2018T23:29:58,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/XzDN7h3.jpg
12-06-2018T23:30:20,Dadrobit,But I was hoping there'd at least be an ebay auction or something.
12-06-2018T23:30:22,unsteddyphoenix,that does look kinda fun actually
12-06-2018T23:30:58,Dadrobit,Best I can find is an auction for some promotional material for it for $80.
12-06-2018T23:31:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"Small child voice: ‚ÄúDad, what kind of dinosaur is that?‚Äù"
12-06-2018T23:31:27,unsteddyphoenix,"""Is that that VCR you told me about?"""
12-06-2018T23:32:38,Dadrobit,"""Son, don't make the same mistake that I made. Use a condom."
12-06-2018T23:32:41,Dadrobit,""""
12-06-2018T23:37:29,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúSmall child voice‚Äù
12-06-2018T23:38:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Hold your horses there
