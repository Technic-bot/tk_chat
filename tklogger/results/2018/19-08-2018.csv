19-08-2018T00:00:19,CrRAR,"on a positive note, he lost his attempt to appeal 12 days ago."
19-08-2018T00:00:40,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs the reason he has to register as a SO now
19-08-2018T00:00:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Jury looked at his appeal and was like ‚Äútf is this?‚Äù
19-08-2018T00:01:58,SpazztasticKiwi,He‚Äôs labeled for life now and has been given some sort of punishment but what if he tries it again? And it‚Äôs worse?
19-08-2018T00:04:40,CrRAR,"mmm, that's what is sad but the courts will not be so lenient again, (sad to say that), folks that don't learn by their mistakes are bound to repeat them, THEN they get what they deserve."
19-08-2018T00:05:31,CrRAR,"Look at OJ, got off on murder, decided to be an idiot again years later (never stopped being an idiot), went to jail big time the next time."
19-08-2018T00:05:48,CrRAR,For something really stupid.
19-08-2018T00:06:09,CrRAR,Even after probabtion the courts will be breathing down his neck.
19-08-2018T00:10:03,CrRAR,"Alrighty, time for sleep, it is quite late."
19-08-2018T00:10:08,CrRAR,till later folks!

19-08-2018T00:13:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Laters. I‚Äôm gonna check in on my sims and their newborn
19-08-2018T00:22:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Change diaper animation: toss infant into air
19-08-2018T00:22:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Accurate
19-08-2018T00:32:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom, you ever played Fate?"
19-08-2018T00:35:08,Twokinds,I don't think so
19-08-2018T00:38:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh
19-08-2018T00:57:45,SpazztasticKiwi,To be fair I‚Äôm not sure many do anymore
19-08-2018T01:22:18,CrimsonQuill,Morning all.
19-08-2018T01:26:33,CrimsonQuill,and cheerio
19-08-2018T01:51:49,Bgrmystr2,aw I missed all the post-stream chat
19-08-2018T01:51:57,Bgrmystr2,I felt like garbage after the streams
19-08-2018T01:52:05,Bgrmystr2,so my body noped
19-08-2018T01:54:03,Bgrmystr2,"Also, I don't think DarthKeidran realizes that tom's patreon page is set to 18+ and has been from the get-go,"
19-08-2018T01:54:20,Bgrmystr2,so his post is both wrong and irrelevant :/
19-08-2018T01:57:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Kid joins fandom that is not his age group or maturity level
19-08-2018T01:57:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Then complains
19-08-2018T01:57:45,SpazztasticKiwi,?
19-08-2018T01:58:32,Bgrmystr2,"the Vey dude, yes"
19-08-2018T01:58:33,Bgrmystr2,for sure
19-08-2018T01:58:53,Bgrmystr2,"the Keidran dude has been here for long enough, dunno what bug poked him in the butt lol"
19-08-2018T01:59:00,Bgrmystr2,but he should know better lol
19-08-2018T02:00:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Kids gonna kid

19-08-2018T02:08:50,DarthRexKing,Who is Elven?
19-08-2018T02:09:13,Bgrmystr2,"it's no doubt he made an adult comment, but it's not like that's out of the ordinary or shouldn't be expected when the comic and site images contain nudity and implied sexual content"
19-08-2018T02:09:27,DarthRexKing,Also Children will always be stupid when they try to think for themselves. No doubt about that.
19-08-2018T02:09:31,Bgrmystr2,one of the ppl on patreon
19-08-2018T02:09:35,DarthRexKing,Ah.
19-08-2018T02:09:54,Bgrmystr2,"he was on here too, but he doesn't frequent the streams as much as others"
19-08-2018T02:10:40,DarthRexKing,I am looking back at chat. I am guessing his sense of humor sucks.
19-08-2018T02:11:59,DarthRexKing,I am going to bed. Goodnight everyone.
19-08-2018T02:12:42,Bgrmystr2,naw it doesn't suck
19-08-2018T02:12:55,Bgrmystr2,other ppl just don't consider the place they're in and bitch a fit
19-08-2018T02:13:03,Bgrmystr2,at normal things
19-08-2018T02:13:05,DarthRexKing,ah.
19-08-2018T02:13:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Worth at least a chuckle
19-08-2018T02:13:27,Bgrmystr2,agree kiwi
19-08-2018T02:14:00,Bgrmystr2,"if you can't look at that comment ant at least ""I see what you did there"" even if you don't like it.. then maybe just not mature enough to be here :u"
19-08-2018T02:14:35,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs a problem when it‚Äôs over used
19-08-2018T02:14:42,Bgrmystr2,that's ture

19-08-2018T16:47:39,SpazztasticKiwi,If I had to choose a strictly main character I would be tempted by Kat more than any of them
19-08-2018T16:47:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"If not just main characters, there‚Äôs others I‚Äôd consider"
19-08-2018T16:48:12,RimaDraws,natani is just my type
