16-01-2018T18:35:29,RandomTKLover,Also is it just me or is picarto glitchier than usual?
16-01-2018T18:35:43,BadFoMo,How so?
16-01-2018T18:36:30,RandomTKLover,"Like, all the buttons are replaced by squares"
16-01-2018T18:36:36,RandomTKLover,Or boxes

16-01-2018T18:38:24,Bgrmystr2,"mmmn, nope Random"
16-01-2018T18:38:38,Bgrmystr2,"might be buggy graphics on your computer, mate"
16-01-2018T18:38:46,RandomTKLover,Reloading doesn’t seem to help
16-01-2018T18:38:48,Bgrmystr2,gpu overheating possibly
16-01-2018T18:38:57,RandomTKLover,"And I use a phone, no comp"
16-01-2018T18:39:08,Bgrmystr2,then your phone may have graphical issues
16-01-2018T18:39:12,Bgrmystr2,maybe restart phone
16-01-2018T18:39:20,RandomTKLover,"Ok, brb"
16-01-2018T18:39:25,Bgrmystr2,can't replace gpu on phones xDD

16-01-2018T18:40:55,Bgrmystr2,":thumbsup: unfortunately if your phone did it once, it may do it again"
16-01-2018T18:41:14,Bgrmystr2,"it could stem from heat issues, or software/hardware failure"
16-01-2018T18:41:25,Bgrmystr2,"it will probably happen again, and get worse."
16-01-2018T18:41:34,Bgrmystr2,"over time, but I dunno how long"
16-01-2018T18:41:40,Bgrmystr2,"could be weeks, could be years, who knows?"
16-01-2018T18:42:01,Bgrmystr2,bugs like that don't happen randomly lol
16-01-2018T18:42:13,Bgrmystr2,so I just hope it's not caused by something series
16-01-2018T18:42:19,Bgrmystr2,..serious* even
16-01-2018T18:42:46,BadFoMo,"A little late, but what I have seen in the Time Stamp button for the popout chat not working, not being able to close the Users part on the popout chat, and some times the page will not compleatly load on startup."

16-01-2018T19:46:28,Bgrmystr2,"Random, if you're talking about a character poll on patreon, tom's been trying to get a poll up so he can see what non-main characters need more love, basically. :u"
16-01-2018T19:46:38,Bgrmystr2,side characters and whatnot

16-01-2018T20:33:52,BluePhantom90,well Tom didn't have to work on the Sketches and had a break for the two days unless he did a Nora card. He most likely will steam
16-01-2018T20:34:39,Bgrmystr2,"there's a stream scheduled today, so unless he says there isn't going to be a stream, then there probably will be one"
16-01-2018T20:38:09,Combak,Depends on how long the sketching of the page takes.

16-01-2018T22:28:52,TheFDdriver,"its called ""the link"""
16-01-2018T22:28:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Zen was like ""your turn"" and passed on to Nat"
16-01-2018T22:29:04,Corinthian,Dang it Zen
16-01-2018T22:29:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,thats my boy
16-01-2018T22:29:44,Dadrobit,The morning feast of home invaders finally hit Natani's stomach
16-01-2018T22:29:50,BadFoMo,My mind went pervy. ...Look at panels 3 and 4.
16-01-2018T22:30:13,Dadrobit,"GJ FoMo, cannot unsee"
16-01-2018T22:30:37,TheFDdriver,wait how does the panels are numbered?
16-01-2018T22:31:03,WarToWin,the order you read them
16-01-2018T22:31:04,Bgrmystr2,"it generally starts with the first panel, FD"
16-01-2018T22:31:10,Bgrmystr2,then onto the next panel
16-01-2018T22:31:12,unsteddyphoenix,How does them panel are be nymbers?
16-01-2018T22:31:31,Bgrmystr2,"1, then 2, then 3.. then maybe 4.. possibly"
16-01-2018T22:31:52,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: I would think the 5th panel comes next but I'm not sure lol
16-01-2018T22:32:08,Combak,"Didn't we kinda talk about this a few streams back? You know, panel leading or something like that?"
16-01-2018T22:32:11,Dadrobit,"No, 5 is right out."
16-01-2018T22:32:19,TheFDdriver,"Bgr, I meant like 2 right 3 left and so on"
16-01-2018T22:32:30,unsteddyphoenix,Out of the questionm
16-01-2018T22:32:32,Bgrmystr2,"Oh, who knows FD? Tom flips the page a bunch of times"
16-01-2018T22:32:38,Bgrmystr2,so right now it could be flipped
16-01-2018T22:32:58,Bgrmystr2,I don't recall last time he flipped or if this is the correct orientation
16-01-2018T22:33:04,Combak,"Where's the ""This end up"" marker when you need it..."
16-01-2018T22:33:09,Dadrobit,Never not love this song.
16-01-2018T22:33:12,Bgrmystr2,that wouldn't help combak xD
16-01-2018T22:33:33,Combak,:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
16-01-2018T22:33:36,Dadrobit,"Needs the, ""This ends here"" marker"
16-01-2018T22:33:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"we need five ""This ends here"" marker s"
16-01-2018T22:34:12,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. a beginning / ending would be nice. a left / right marking would also work. but top is the same for both.
16-01-2018T22:34:22,Dadrobit,"Too many endings, this isn't The Stanley Parable, Marv."
16-01-2018T22:34:29,unsteddyphoenix,Its the both for same!

16-01-2018T22:35:26,Bgrmystr2,just cuz he doesn't talk much

16-01-2018T22:36:57,BadFoMo,@Twokinds I think your mic is malfuntioning.

16-01-2018T23:21:12,MuonNeutrino,"huh. the sequence of panels there confuses me a bit - in the left one it looks like nat is falling down, but in the right one he's not?"

16-01-2018T23:21:34,Ordithus,Natani may have landed on his bum
16-01-2018T23:21:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yes please
16-01-2018T23:21:35,Combak,Nat took a seat.
16-01-2018T23:21:51,BadFoMo,@unsteddyphoenix ...Yes.
16-01-2018T23:21:51,unsteddyphoenix,I really like that ink blotch style. I wonder if that could be requested. :thinking:
16-01-2018T23:22:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,maybe
16-01-2018T23:22:22,Combak,RIP Abstract panel.
16-01-2018T23:22:36,Twokinds,I don't see why not
16-01-2018T23:22:38,MuonNeutrino,"@Ordithus hm, i suppose so. before tom did the background i thought it might have been a sideways panel like in the middle of http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/986/"
16-01-2018T23:22:46,Serpentfrog,Inb4 all of the text is about getting high.
16-01-2018T23:22:57,unsteddyphoenix,Coolio
16-01-2018T23:23:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I was gonna clean my room, then I got bored"
16-01-2018T23:23:09,MuonNeutrino,but the background looks like nat is still vertical
16-01-2018T23:23:14,BadFoMo,High?
16-01-2018T23:23:26,TheFDdriver,"""Something is poking me"""
16-01-2018T23:23:29,TheFDdriver,XD
16-01-2018T23:23:39,Ordithus,@MuonNeutrino I also wasn't too certain on the panel order
16-01-2018T23:23:48,ViscariaSongbird,"Ember has no eyes, how mysterious"
16-01-2018T23:23:52,Twokinds,Of course it's about getting high. Gotta ride the dragon.
16-01-2018T23:24:05,MuonNeutrino,"yeah i kept wondering if the comic was currently reversed or not like tom does sometimes, until i looked at nat's eyes anyway"
16-01-2018T23:24:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-smug::ctwokinds-rainehappy:
16-01-2018T23:24:12,MuonNeutrino,heheh
16-01-2018T23:24:22,Char89TheCharizard,which dragon? Lady Nora or Princess Remi?
16-01-2018T23:24:34,unsteddyphoenix,Is that what theyre calling it nowadays?
16-01-2018T23:24:38,Serpentfrog,"Remember kids: as a great man once said, mmm drugs."
16-01-2018T23:24:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,puff the magic dragon
16-01-2018T23:25:11,Ordithus,"muon, Tom has never accidentally reversed Nat's eyes.  Never."
16-01-2018T23:25:23,MuonNeutrino,"i know, but it's still an indication XD"
16-01-2018T23:25:36,TheFDdriver,have you ever name something or someone?
16-01-2018T23:25:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,he has forgotten to draw the third one tho
16-01-2018T23:25:41,MuonNeutrino,and the TOP four panels make more sense in this order rather than the reverse
16-01-2018T23:25:45,Ordithus,I do like his expression in panel 4
16-01-2018T23:25:52,Ordithus,That's like me in the morning

16-01-2018T23:27:06,MuonNeutrino,"i suppose nat falling down and landing on his butt makes sense, also would explain why keith just has a concerned look in the bottom left panel rather than a look of complete panic like might be expected if nat collapsed flat on his back &gt;.&gt;"
16-01-2018T23:27:16,Ordithus,Good point
16-01-2018T23:27:27,Ordithus,"Not again, again!"

16-01-2018T23:33:46,MuonNeutrino,i wonder what raine is protesting in that panel
16-01-2018T23:33:58,MuonNeutrino,"what, did nat try to touch zen's leg and he passed out from the pain?"
16-01-2018T23:34:05,MuonNeutrino,and raine is all like 'DONT DO THAT'
16-01-2018T23:34:20,unsteddyphoenix,I think Nat wanted tolook closely at it and Raine told her not to
16-01-2018T23:34:27,unsteddyphoenix,BUT SHE DID IT ANYWAY THE MADMAN
