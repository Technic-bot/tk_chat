16-10-2018T11:09:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I gotta muffin
16-10-2018T11:09:12,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs way too early to be up
16-10-2018T11:09:58,Mippy,Morning :ctwokinds-katdryer:

16-10-2018T11:21:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Copy Kat
16-10-2018T11:21:46,Twokinds,Indeed
16-10-2018T11:22:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I may be tired but the puns are alive and well
16-10-2018T11:28:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom you think you‚Äôll keep your schedule like this or are you gonna try reshifting your hours
16-10-2018T11:28:29,Twokinds,I'm going to try and maintain a 12 - 8am sleep schedule
16-10-2018T11:28:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Try
16-10-2018T11:28:46,Twokinds,It's nice to be awake during daylight hours.
16-10-2018T11:28:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Key word
16-10-2018T11:28:54,Twokinds,Yeeeah
16-10-2018T11:29:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Mornings mean more people tho
16-10-2018T11:29:29,SpazztasticKiwi,And sunlight
16-10-2018T11:29:30,Twokinds,I don't think so...
16-10-2018T11:29:38,Twokinds,Most people seem busy during the day.
16-10-2018T11:29:49,Twokinds,It's a lot less busy here during the morning.
16-10-2018T11:30:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I work where there‚Äôs always one over pepped ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù person
16-10-2018T11:31:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"And we‚Äôre a 24 hour place, so while it gets quieter, there‚Äôs always people"
16-10-2018T11:31:10,Twokinds,Yeah I have one of those in my office too.
16-10-2018T11:31:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd rather work with cats. At least all Holly generally wants is a pat and food
16-10-2018T11:32:21,Twokinds,Holly is funny. She get prepped for patting anytime I show any sign of waking up.
16-10-2018T11:32:47,Twokinds,And she gets so disappointed when I just go to the bathroom and then right back to bed. Makes me feel guilty.
16-10-2018T11:33:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Sounds like Bagheera. You can‚Äôt show signs you‚Äôre awake. He can smell fear
16-10-2018T11:34:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Kiwi‚Äôs content to snooze along with me. She‚Äôll get up when I do most often
16-10-2018T11:37:36,iliar,"Light, people... This is all not very important. I know the real reason Tom wants to be awake during daylight hours. During the day, food delivery is available."
16-10-2018T11:53:05,Twokinds,Also true
16-10-2018T11:53:39,Twokinds,Man it's cold today
16-10-2018T11:53:45,Twokinds,There's a freeze warning in cinci tomorrow
16-10-2018T11:54:07,Twokinds,Low of 32 tonight (0c)
16-10-2018T11:57:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Temperature dropped from 90 to 55 like it saw a state trooper
16-10-2018T12:08:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll be back later
16-10-2018T12:08:45,Twokinds,I'll be waiting

16-10-2018T12:38:58,Twokinds,"Thank you, NibblyBot"
16-10-2018T13:12:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I doth returnith
16-10-2018T13:13:07,Twokinds,Welcome back.
16-10-2018T13:13:10,Twokinds,Nothing happened.
16-10-2018T13:14:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Of course not
16-10-2018T13:14:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I wasn‚Äôt here
16-10-2018T13:15:46,Dadrobit,Can confirm it's nearly getting to freezing temps even here. Lows of ~62~. Ridiculous.
16-10-2018T13:17:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Nice of Eric to sell his playbo- I mean perfectly non-fan service comic for $10
16-10-2018T13:18:35,Dadrobit,My sources tell me that that's actually kind of expensive.
16-10-2018T13:19:26,Twokinds,It's pretty average for an indie comic.
16-10-2018T13:19:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Is sarcasm considered a foreign language
16-10-2018T13:19:52,SpazztasticKiwi,?
16-10-2018T13:19:59,Dadrobit,"Ah, was comparing it more to the aforementioned unmentionable which goes for about $6."
16-10-2018T13:20:13,Twokinds,$6 seems like an awkward number.
16-10-2018T13:20:21,SpazztasticKiwi,‚Äúaforementioned unmentionables‚Äù
16-10-2018T13:20:35,Twokinds,"If someone's willing to spend $6, they're probably not too fussed about spending 10"
16-10-2018T13:20:36,SpazztasticKiwi,$6 is what I got McLoughlin‚Äôs book for
16-10-2018T13:20:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Granted it‚Äôs not a comic
16-10-2018T13:21:00,Dadrobit,Or just subscribe for $20-$27 a year.
16-10-2018T13:21:47,Dadrobit,"Also, an extra $4 is a 66% markup. Eric's running a racket."
16-10-2018T13:22:13,SpazztasticKiwi,That doesn‚Äôt surprise me
16-10-2018T13:22:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Eric‚Äôs so full of bull I‚Äôm shocked the cows don‚Äôt follow him home
16-10-2018T13:27:27,Dadrobit,"Though, to be honest, I never did get into the ""physical media""."
16-10-2018T13:27:49,Dadrobit,"I almost feel like I've missed out, but not realy."
16-10-2018T13:28:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Physical media being book collecting?
16-10-2018T13:28:42,Twokinds,I try to. I like to collect small print webcomics
16-10-2018T13:28:55,Dadrobit,"Odd to talk about it, but it was/is almost a point of pride from my grandfather being a Playboy Mansion member, even still has the key on his ring to this day."
16-10-2018T13:29:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Only comic I physically own is TK
16-10-2018T13:29:13,Twokinds,I like having a bookshelf of comics that aren't widely available.
16-10-2018T13:29:27,Twokinds,And I love amature webcomics
16-10-2018T13:29:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I read ‚Äúmature‚Äù there for a second
16-10-2018T13:29:55,Twokinds,lol
16-10-2018T13:29:56,Dadrobit,"Have a few comics, just picked up a Sandman issue two days ago"
16-10-2018T13:30:12,Dadrobit,Oh! I didn't not read it as mature until you mentioned it wasn't lol.
16-10-2018T13:30:13,Twokinds,There's something about seeing something not-quite pro level but still in print that I really like.
16-10-2018T13:30:54,Twokinds,"It's cool, at least to me."
16-10-2018T13:31:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Only other comics I‚Äôd collect is the true Friday the 13th collection
16-10-2018T13:31:19,Xexanoth,"i love Eric ""Mad Scientist"" look in the new sketch"
16-10-2018T13:31:20,Dadrobit,"I have a similar collection of amateur writings in my ""Writers of the Future"" anthologies."
16-10-2018T13:31:28,Xexanoth,...and now we know where frankenkeidran comes from
16-10-2018T13:31:54,Dadrobit,They're collections of short stories submitted and organized under the L Ron Hubbard name.
16-10-2018T13:32:13,Dadrobit,from amateur authors trying to get their names out.
16-10-2018T13:32:49,Dadrobit,Used to pick up a new anthology every couple weeks to read at work while I was in security. Amassed a fair collection in my bookshelf.
16-10-2018T13:33:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I like the styles similar to Voorheese‚Äôs story
16-10-2018T13:34:21,SpazztasticKiwi,But the cartoon/lighter characters too
16-10-2018T13:35:04,Dadrobit,brb
16-10-2018T13:35:31,Twokinds,I imagine Eric's comic going like that Daffy Duck short where Bugs takes over as animator.
16-10-2018T13:37:24,SpazztasticKiwi,And I just thought of Eric cross dressing to get into the powder room
16-10-2018T13:38:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"To be clear, a powder room‚Äôs not necessarily a bathroom or changing room"
16-10-2018T13:40:39,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs lunchtime and I don‚Äôt know what I want
16-10-2018T13:46:14,Twokinds,Food!
16-10-2018T13:51:09,SpazztasticKiwi,:ptv-unimpressed:

16-10-2018T13:52:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt have a KFC
16-10-2018T13:52:12,SpazztasticKiwi,And hi
16-10-2018T13:52:25,Kitty95,:O drive to it
16-10-2018T13:53:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Closest one is 20 minutes. I don‚Äôt need it that bad
16-10-2018T13:54:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I might just get a mini pizza
16-10-2018T13:55:04,Kitty95,what toppings?
16-10-2018T13:55:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Just cheese I guess
16-10-2018T13:55:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not terribly hungry. Had a muffin earlier
16-10-2018T13:55:43,SpazztasticKiwi,A not normal sized muffin
16-10-2018T13:59:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Might get tacos before I go home
16-10-2018T14:03:45,SpazztasticKiwi,üçï

16-10-2018T15:16:19,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-sleepy:
16-10-2018T16:39:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Guys I think my coworker‚Äôs higher than the space station
16-10-2018T17:12:55,Dadrobit,"How funny, I myself just got back from seeing ""First Man""."
16-10-2018T17:13:31,Dadrobit,"Was exceptionally ""meh"""
16-10-2018T17:14:56,Dadrobit,The funding would have been 1000x better suited towards making an actual documentary.
16-10-2018T17:15:59,Bgrmystr2,"I'd honestly like answers to why the image of the first footprint by Neil and the shoe he ""actually used"" have completely different markings on the bottom"
16-10-2018T17:16:10,Bgrmystr2,but that's for another day :v
16-10-2018T17:16:22,Dadrobit,"You can tell that they wanted a more accurate representation of the progress towards landing on the moon, but there were enough ""movie"" elements that it was just tonally offputting."
16-10-2018T17:17:57,Dadrobit,"There wasn't enough effort into making it an ""entertainment"" movie, nor was there enough effort put into it as a ""documentary"" movie. It tried to fly down the middle, but the eagle never quite landed with their direction. Or lack thereof as it were."
16-10-2018T17:18:36,Dadrobit,It was like Gravity minus about 85% of the cinematography or sound design.
16-10-2018T17:19:25,Dadrobit,"There were moments that it did well of course, but they were just that: moments."
16-10-2018T17:21:28,Dadrobit,"I dunno. It was respectful towards the lives that put their all in to the Apollo project, but the end result, just felt lifeless."
16-10-2018T17:22:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Only thing is I don‚Äôt care he‚Äôs possibly high - I care he‚Äôs acting spacy
16-10-2018T18:19:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"Maybe he‚Äôs just acting weird cause he‚Äôs weird. Anyhoo, I‚Äôm off work. Thinkin of gettin subway or somethin"
16-10-2018T18:42:37,Twokinds,"Red Dead 2 is coming out soon, isn't it?"
16-10-2018T18:48:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Oct. 26
16-10-2018T18:49:07,Twokinds,Red Dead 1 was one of my favorite games. I'm gunna be sad I won't be able to play 2 right away.
16-10-2018T18:49:36,unsteddyphoenix,Lot of my friends are hype about that game
16-10-2018T18:49:42,unsteddyphoenix,I missed the first one but it does look cool.
16-10-2018T18:49:47,unsteddyphoenix,Why wont you?
16-10-2018T18:50:01,Twokinds,I'm just very busy right now.
16-10-2018T18:50:03,Mippy,Due to finish two projects today. I think I‚Äôm gonna make it :ctwokinds-rainehappy:
16-10-2018T18:50:08,Twokinds,Darn being an adult.
16-10-2018T18:50:27,Twokinds,"With all the delays last month, I gotta focus on drawing for now."
16-10-2018T18:50:31,unsteddyphoenix,Ah I see.
16-10-2018T18:50:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve never played ‚Äúbig‚Äù games like that. Dunno how they are if none of the Youtubers I watch plays em
16-10-2018T18:50:41,unsteddyphoenix,Gosh darn it to heck
16-10-2018T18:51:12,unsteddyphoenix,"Very responsible. I guess the game can be your ""reward"" or whatever"

16-10-2018T18:53:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I asked the subway lady how much extra olives were and she just says ‚Äúoh I can just give you more‚Äù and slaps on another handful
16-10-2018T18:53:57,Mippy,...dang! Free olives
16-10-2018T18:54:38,SpazztasticKiwi,It is late. She‚Äôs probably more than ready to go home and doesn‚Äôt care. I just thanked her and went on
16-10-2018T18:54:55,unsteddyphoenix,grats on the olives
16-10-2018T18:55:20,Mippy,Good Kiwi....you took the olives and ran.
16-10-2018T18:55:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, cool your getting stuff done Tom. Maybe with this new schedule you‚Äôre going to try getting on you‚Äôll earn the spare time for some game time"
16-10-2018T18:55:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I paid

16-10-2018T19:16:27,Twokinds,I really don't want to spend the money.
16-10-2018T19:17:01,Ordithus,"Yeah, that is a problem.  Houses are expensive."
16-10-2018T19:17:04,SpazztasticKiwi,So get a tent and become a true hermit
16-10-2018T19:17:36,Ordithus,"Window shopping, Kiwi?  I'll be shopping for windows!  They are from '59... need updating."

16-10-2018T20:06:34,CrRAR,yeah meatballs are the comfort food you don't suspect.
16-10-2018T20:06:48,CrRAR,homemade is the shiznit

16-10-2018T20:08:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh that sounds good
16-10-2018T20:08:29,CrRAR,mushrooms are a good substitute for meat someties
16-10-2018T20:08:48,Ordithus,Stuffed mushrooms are delish
16-10-2018T20:08:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Reminds me of when Mark shared his Mama Doom‚Äôs meatloaf recipe
16-10-2018T20:09:00,SpazztasticKiwi,People asked if they could make it vegetarian
16-10-2018T20:09:09,SpazztasticKiwi,He nearly blew a gasket
