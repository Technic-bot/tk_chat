09-11-2018T00:00:23,ThingsAreMoving,practical
09-11-2018T00:00:23,Bgrmystr2,My mouse works again! \o/
09-11-2018T00:00:28,ThingsAreMoving,wohoo!
09-11-2018T00:00:30,CrRAR,:DDD
09-11-2018T00:00:34,w0lfmare,o/
09-11-2018T00:00:55,Bgrmystr2,friendface came by with a cable after having ordered it monday and supposed to get it tues
09-11-2018T00:01:03,Bgrmystr2,I didn't get it till like 30 mins ago
09-11-2018T00:01:04,Wertgard,:ptv-sneakysmirk:
09-11-2018T00:01:23,Bgrmystr2,"not fun week, but nice finish"
09-11-2018T00:01:25,ThingsAreMoving,"wait, so it was just a frayed cable?"
09-11-2018T00:01:30,Bgrmystr2,yeah
09-11-2018T00:01:32,Bgrmystr2,prettymuch
09-11-2018T00:01:48,Bgrmystr2,and it took them 3 days for 1 day shipping.
09-11-2018T00:02:05,CrRAR,outrageous!
09-11-2018T00:02:12,Bgrmystr2,Thaaaaat's amazon.
09-11-2018T00:02:13,ThingsAreMoving,and it was used for charging only?
09-11-2018T00:02:32,Bgrmystr2,"yeh charging only, I believe"
09-11-2018T00:02:42,Bgrmystr2,it doesn't send data far as I'm aware
09-11-2018T00:03:20,ThingsAreMoving,"huh, could've just opened it up, cut the damaged part and stitch the good part together"
09-11-2018T00:03:41,ThingsAreMoving,you'd have a semi-working cable until a new one would arrive
09-11-2018T00:03:46,Bgrmystr2,that requires tools
09-11-2018T00:03:50,ThingsAreMoving,a knife
09-11-2018T00:03:50,Bgrmystr2,of which I do not have
09-11-2018T00:04:03,Bgrmystr2,"and no, not just knife, it requires soldering the wire"
09-11-2018T00:04:07,ThingsAreMoving,nope
09-11-2018T00:04:12,ThingsAreMoving,no soldering required
09-11-2018T00:04:35,CrRAR,...b-but then there'd be no satisfaction slam dunking the junk one solidly in the trash. >:
09-11-2018T00:04:46,Bgrmystr2,"one cable was shredded, another was completely cut"
09-11-2018T00:05:09,Bgrmystr2,it needed more than a halfass fix
09-11-2018T00:05:39,ThingsAreMoving,halfass fix would be enough to use the mouse until a new one arrived
09-11-2018T00:05:44,Bgrmystr2,"I have other mice though so.. it was a painful, but managable week"
09-11-2018T00:05:47,CrRAR,Just shoulda stuck the frayed part in your mouth.
09-11-2018T00:05:52,Bgrmystr2,..yes Cr
09-11-2018T00:05:53,ThingsAreMoving,"but nvm, you have a new one"
09-11-2018T00:05:56,CrRAR,The electrons would have found the way
09-11-2018T00:06:00,Bgrmystr2,Should I just lick the wall socket too? :P
09-11-2018T00:06:05,CrRAR,xD
09-11-2018T00:06:07,SpazztasticKiwi,So I just learned about the nasty ass habit some people have of eating ketchup with their eggs
09-11-2018T00:06:13,Bgrmystr2,"y'know, while I'm at it"
09-11-2018T00:06:15,SpazztasticKiwi,WHY
09-11-2018T00:06:19,ThingsAreMoving,Eggs with ketchup are nice
09-11-2018T00:06:25,CrRAR,"Electrons are smart, yo!"
09-11-2018T00:06:28,ThingsAreMoving,but only hardboiled eggs
09-11-2018T00:07:04,Bgrmystr2,"and you'd have to see the cable, things. it's not really that easy where it broke. it was on the end of the adapter that plugged into the mouse"
09-11-2018T00:07:06,w0lfmare,brb
09-11-2018T00:07:26,Bgrmystr2,wasn't just sliced in the middle lol
09-11-2018T00:07:28,CrRAR,ok
09-11-2018T00:08:07,ThingsAreMoving,I once repaired a cable that had ~5mm of good wire sticking out from the plug
09-11-2018T00:08:21,ThingsAreMoving,anything less than that is too hard to bother
09-11-2018T00:08:40,CrRAR,mmm
09-11-2018T00:08:53,Bgrmystr2,"my wire is lucky to have 2mm, if that"
09-11-2018T00:09:06,ThingsAreMoving,rip
09-11-2018T00:09:14,Bgrmystr2,and there's like 15+ wires at that length
09-11-2018T00:09:20,Bgrmystr2,all in diff directions
09-11-2018T00:09:23,Bgrmystr2,it's great :u
09-11-2018T00:09:27,Bgrmystr2,so I noped
09-11-2018T00:09:35,ThingsAreMoving,15 wires for a mouse charger? :ctwokinds-keith8D:
09-11-2018T00:09:45,ThingsAreMoving,are you using LHC as a mouse?
09-11-2018T00:09:52,Bgrmystr2,well yeah it's all the individual metal wires
09-11-2018T00:10:00,Bgrmystr2,inside the shielding
09-11-2018T00:10:08,ThingsAreMoving,damn bro
09-11-2018T00:10:27,ThingsAreMoving,well then my argument is moot. I guess I wouldn't bother too
09-11-2018T00:10:51,ThingsAreMoving,"what mouse are you using, just out of curiosity?"
09-11-2018T00:11:01,Bgrmystr2,Logitech's MX Master

09-11-2018T00:51:15,ThingsAreMoving,I wonder if oceanic water is any good for boiling potatoes
09-11-2018T00:51:24,ThingsAreMoving,I mean... it's already salted
09-11-2018T00:51:42,Bgrmystr2,a bit.. too much salt
09-11-2018T00:51:45,Bgrmystr2,probably

09-11-2018T01:39:31,CrRAR,bye
09-11-2018T01:40:03,JamesBSquirrel3,bye twentydollarcoffee
09-11-2018T01:40:43,Twokinds,twenty dollars seems like a lot for coffee.
09-11-2018T01:41:18,ThingsAreMoving,You get a bucketful of coffee
09-11-2018T01:41:31,w0lfmare,It's good for 24 hours
09-11-2018T01:41:40,ThingsAreMoving,"speaking of which... brb, gonna get some :ctwokinds-kingtea:"
09-11-2018T01:41:59,JamesBSquirrel3,same here brb!
09-11-2018T01:43:45,SpazztasticKiwi,$20 coffee but you get the coffee maker too
09-11-2018T01:43:56,Twokinds,But for twenty dollars you could get 3 months worth of coffee.
09-11-2018T01:44:01,SpazztasticKiwi,As in the barista
09-11-2018T01:44:02,Twokinds,Just have to make it yourself.
09-11-2018T01:44:53,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s the kicker
09-11-2018T01:45:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless you get one of those machines that are on a timer
09-11-2018T01:45:35,Twokinds,I don't know how to use those
09-11-2018T01:45:53,SpazztasticKiwi,You just set it like an alarm I believe
09-11-2018T01:46:13,SpazztasticKiwi,“Start brewing so I’ll have my cup ready at 5:00 am”
09-11-2018T01:46:15,Twokinds,But you still have to set everything up beforehand.
09-11-2018T01:46:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Yep
09-11-2018T01:46:34,Twokinds,I don't have that kind of forethought.
09-11-2018T01:46:34,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s the price you pay for future convenience
09-11-2018T01:47:01,Twokinds,I use coffee packets. They have the cream and sugar and coffee all in the packet.
09-11-2018T01:47:04,Twokinds,Just add water.
09-11-2018T01:47:16,Wertgard,:ptv-confused:
09-11-2018T01:47:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Ain’t that the same stuff they give complimentary at hotels
09-11-2018T01:47:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause I’ve made my opinion on that clear
09-11-2018T01:48:19,w0lfmare,I don't drink coffee :cw0lfmare-Paperember:
09-11-2018T01:48:37,Bgrmystr2,same w0lf
09-11-2018T01:48:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I have a taste for strong coffee so it’s whatever you like
09-11-2018T01:48:48,iliar,coffee packets??? That's disgusting.
09-11-2018T01:48:54,ThingsAreMoving,I started buying a decent quality coffee from Nicaragua. Costs around 20$ per month but it's damn worth it.
09-11-2018T01:48:57,Wertgard,Same Wof
09-11-2018T01:49:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m sure it fits his schedule best
09-11-2018T01:49:31,Wertgard,Good to know another people who don't
09-11-2018T01:49:40,Wertgard,:ptv-uneasy:
09-11-2018T01:49:41,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s why we got all these different forms and ways
09-11-2018T01:50:17,ThingsAreMoving,"Not drinking coffee is ok, but please don't make a movement out of it like vegans did"
09-11-2018T01:51:06,Bgrmystr2,"well, coffee is addictive so that is one reason I don't drink it."
09-11-2018T01:51:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"I kinda like the darker blends, or a dark foreign blend in general"
09-11-2018T01:51:21,ThingsAreMoving,everything is addictive
09-11-2018T01:51:26,Bgrmystr2,not everything
09-11-2018T01:51:50,ThingsAreMoving,everything you enjoy is addictive
09-11-2018T01:52:12,Bgrmystr2,"the thing is that coffee is actually addictive, you go through withdrawals without it.. if you used to drink a lot of it"
09-11-2018T01:52:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"Not one for sugar as I am creamer, if I add anything"
09-11-2018T01:52:17,Bgrmystr2,my dad had it BAD
09-11-2018T01:52:25,Bgrmystr2,major withdrawals
09-11-2018T01:52:30,SpazztasticKiwi,But chocolate syrup is good in coffee too
09-11-2018T01:52:39,Wertgard,"Things, ahaha. No of course. I can drink it and I am not against, I am not interesting to drink it regularly"
09-11-2018T01:53:11,iliar,Do not misunderstand me. I usually buy the cheapest coffee that can be found in the store. But the coffee packets... I think the contents of these packages have nothing to do with coffee
09-11-2018T01:53:29,Bgrmystr2,there's prolly some out there that are actually coffee though
09-11-2018T01:53:36,ThingsAreMoving,Are coffe packets the same thing as instant coffee?
09-11-2018T01:53:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Essentially
09-11-2018T01:54:07,Twokinds,Yeah they're instant.
09-11-2018T01:54:10,Twokinds,They're quite good.
09-11-2018T01:54:21,SpazztasticKiwi,One reason I really don’t like them is if you don’t mix them well enough..
09-11-2018T01:54:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Not a fan of the grit
09-11-2018T01:54:35,ThingsAreMoving,Can you tell me the brand of those? I'd like to taste them
09-11-2018T01:54:58,w0lfmare,I like fruit juice in the morning instead of coffee
09-11-2018T01:55:11,w0lfmare,The good stuff
09-11-2018T01:55:20,SageSaga,Tom

09-11-2018T01:55:49,SageSaga,i think im done dude
09-11-2018T01:55:52,iliar,"Hmm ... Perhaps in your country, these packages are better ... In my country, even the cheapest instant coffee is many times better than 3in1 packages"
09-11-2018T01:55:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Nah he gone
09-11-2018T01:55:54,Twokinds,They got me talking about coffee!

09-11-2018T01:56:08,SpazztasticKiwi,You started it

09-11-2018T01:56:21,Twokinds,Looks good
09-11-2018T01:56:49,Bgrmystr2,"I'm liking this, what's this last panel sage?"
09-11-2018T01:56:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I like the way you do hair
09-11-2018T01:57:01,Bgrmystr2,can't really tell..
09-11-2018T01:57:07,SageSaga,last panel? or second to last?
09-11-2018T01:57:10,Bgrmystr2,or.. 2nd to last panel?
09-11-2018T01:57:18,ThingsAreMoving,looks like... a handprint
09-11-2018T01:57:19,Bgrmystr2,you had it flipped when I said it
09-11-2018T01:57:20,ThingsAreMoving,?
09-11-2018T01:57:26,SageSaga,it's a symbol on the cart
09-11-2018T01:57:28,Bgrmystr2,I dunno looks like an xray of a hand to me
09-11-2018T01:57:30,Bgrmystr2,ooh okay

09-11-2018T02:01:46,Bgrmystr2,"tom, you probably like everything."
09-11-2018T02:02:05,Twokinds,The only issue with them is that I need two packets per cup.

09-11-2018T02:02:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom haven’t you said yourself you’re not a picky eater

09-11-2018T02:02:26,ThingsAreMoving,Liking everything is... pretty positive
09-11-2018T02:02:44,Bgrmystr2,"or negative, perhaps dull taste buds"
