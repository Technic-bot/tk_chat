15-01-2018T08:32:46,MintGreen,first time here yaaaay
15-01-2018T13:22:03,MidnightBlue78,:ctwokinds-natsducky:

15-01-2018T13:48:03,MidnightBlue78,good luck Dadro!!!! \o/
15-01-2018T13:55:20,Dadrobit,"EZPZ stuff. Electronic Music II, Sounds design III, and two audio business classes, Recording & Mass Media, and Merchandising Law."
15-01-2018T13:56:13,Dadrobit,Should be no problems
15-01-2018T15:34:33,TheBeckoner,All my stuff got cancelled coz of ice and what not. I believe it is currently 20*f
15-01-2018T17:46:05,DarkLinnk,thats not even that cold
15-01-2018T17:46:58,Bgrmystr2,20F is pretty fucking cold. xD That's like -6.5C
15-01-2018T17:48:05,Bgrmystr2,"unless you live in the arctic or something, DarkLinnk, I think you got your temps mixed up :P"
15-01-2018T17:49:47,DarkLinnk,mhhh jeah I misstyped °-°
15-01-2018T18:05:15,DarkLinnk,and what is everyone doing this fine day/night ?
15-01-2018T18:05:41,TheBeckoner,lol I wish it were 20*C instead believe you me
15-01-2018T18:05:49,TheBeckoner,Im eating chicken noodle soup
15-01-2018T18:18:12,Dadrobit,"Well fuck. Consider my hopes for a good fun class in Electronic Music II. The instructor admits that he isn't intimately familiar with the tech we're using, BUT the entire idea behind the course is leaning the tech. Guy spent 15 minutes trying to copy/pas"
15-01-2018T18:18:25,Dadrobit,copy/paste a drum fill.
15-01-2018T18:18:54,DarkLinnk,GG is guess ?
15-01-2018T18:18:54,Dadrobit,"and we barely got a base line in, in the two hours we spent in the program"
15-01-2018T18:19:04,Dadrobit,bass*
15-01-2018T18:20:23,Dadrobit,Not to mention another idiot student who tried to hijack the class every ten minutes with bullshit technicalities that NO ONE cares about.
15-01-2018T18:21:01,Dadrobit,"""Well some of us are actual audio engineers and we prefer that you use proper terms!"""
15-01-2018T18:21:36,Dadrobit,"Then proceeds to cry about not knowing any music theory and such advanced ideas like ""chords"""
15-01-2018T18:21:38,DarkLinnk,I can already guess who gets head first stuffed in the toilet :ptv-unimpressed:
15-01-2018T18:22:45,Dadrobit,If he does it more in the future I'll pull him aside and talk to him.
15-01-2018T18:23:36,Dadrobit,I'm not gonna have some numb-nut know-it-all ruin a class I payed good money for.
15-01-2018T18:23:41,Dadrobit,paid*
15-01-2018T18:24:53,DarkLinnk,*meanwhile listening to some classic music*
15-01-2018T18:26:44,Bgrmystr2,"lol, wish there was some kinda music thing here. Don't know any. Strange, considering where I am."
15-01-2018T18:26:49,Dadrobit,First assignment is a blues song. Guy complained that he wasn't fast enough to create the bass line riff. It's literally the same note played for 4 measures at 90bpm in quarter notes.
15-01-2018T18:27:23,Dadrobit,No local community college with a music program?
15-01-2018T18:27:32,Bgrmystr2,the local colleges here are trash
15-01-2018T18:28:13,Bgrmystr2,"several friends with first person experience in many fields, all of em knew more than the class was supposed to teach them"
15-01-2018T18:28:23,Bgrmystr2,&gt;.&gt;
15-01-2018T18:28:39,Bgrmystr2,so I won't learn anything and I'll waste money doing it
15-01-2018T18:29:07,Dadrobit,"I'm lucky, mine is pretty damned good. This is the first professor that didn't have his shit locked tight. Everyone else I've had has had a good history in the field and most own their own studios or companies."
15-01-2018T18:29:55,Bgrmystr2,"You'd expect.. in Orleans, the home of Jazz, that there'd be some kind of musical something or other."
15-01-2018T18:30:27,Dadrobit,There -HAS- to be?!?
15-01-2018T18:30:45,Bgrmystr2,"Well, there doesn't have to be"
15-01-2018T18:30:56,Bgrmystr2,I'd just expect there to be one
15-01-2018T18:31:02,Bgrmystr2,at least something remotely decent
15-01-2018T18:31:26,Dadrobit,New Orleans Academy of Music?
15-01-2018T18:32:13,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: where is this
15-01-2018T18:32:28,Dadrobit,"3909 Bienville St, New Orleans, LA 70119"
15-01-2018T18:32:30,Bgrmystr2,oh god
15-01-2018T18:32:33,Bgrmystr2,it's so far away
15-01-2018T18:32:37,Bgrmystr2,yeah
15-01-2018T18:33:49,Bgrmystr2,"I've heard of it, but never knew where it was"
15-01-2018T18:34:46,Bgrmystr2,"Most of the places I was looking at were actually colleges and such, but there's nothing nearby me"
15-01-2018T18:35:06,Bgrmystr2,"nothing with any kind of dorm, anyway"
15-01-2018T18:35:49,Bgrmystr2,and the music classes in those colleges were terrible
15-01-2018T18:37:12,Dadrobit,I got lucky. Central AZ has been oddly fortunate with really good programs and a ton of studios.
15-01-2018T18:37:22,Bgrmystr2,I always thought the academy was part of the local uni
15-01-2018T18:37:46,Bgrmystr2,"plenty of people going to universities, college, etc"
15-01-2018T18:38:10,Bgrmystr2,"nothing any good to speak of, generally, but I did hear several places get called out, that being one of them"
15-01-2018T18:39:39,Bgrmystr2,yeah there's no music schools nearby close enough
15-01-2018T18:42:08,Dadrobit,"There's a place out here called CRAS (Conservatory of Recording Arts and Sciences) that's really well known nationally, they promise to make you a professional in 11 months, but your mileage may vary."
15-01-2018T18:42:59,Dadrobit,"A few of my professors used to teach there, but a lot of them left because they didn't like some of the ideologies enforced."
15-01-2018T18:43:24,Dadrobit,My studio recording class professor was actually one of their founding members.
15-01-2018T18:43:49,Dadrobit,So there's a bit of a rivalry between the schools to put out the better engineers.
15-01-2018T18:44:24,Dadrobit,Also it's fuckin' expensive.
15-01-2018T18:46:02,Dadrobit,"It's an 11 month course work, but costs three times as much as mine which takes two years to complete."
15-01-2018T18:48:43,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, I don't have any kind of money for that shit. Everyone I know had their money go to shit cuz loans for college"
15-01-2018T18:49:01,Bgrmystr2,I don't even know what anything around here would cost
15-01-2018T18:49:56,Bgrmystr2,I know it's enough to completely destroy a decent salary
15-01-2018T18:50:00,Bgrmystr2,but that's about it
15-01-2018T18:50:06,Dadrobit,"No loans for me. I got a job and paid for everything out of pocket as I could afford it. Means my two year program took me three years, but that's saved me who knows how many years of paying off loans."
15-01-2018T18:50:36,Bgrmystr2,"oh, no they had jobs AND had to take out loans"
15-01-2018T18:50:49,Bgrmystr2,and and still owe more on the college payments itself
15-01-2018T18:50:54,Bgrmystr2,nevermind paying back the lone
15-01-2018T18:50:57,Bgrmystr2,loan* even
15-01-2018T18:51:00,Dadrobit,university?
15-01-2018T18:51:11,Bgrmystr2,"college, uni, doesn't matter what school they went to"
15-01-2018T18:51:20,Bgrmystr2,prolly around 4 or 5 different schools
15-01-2018T18:51:24,Bgrmystr2,and all of em had the same problem
15-01-2018T18:51:40,Dadrobit,It does when it comes to money spent. Community college is like a quarter the cost of university.
15-01-2018T18:52:21,Dadrobit,I only pay something like 65$-70$ a credit hour. That's waaaaay fucking cheaper than some place like ASU
15-01-2018T18:52:37,Bgrmystr2,dunno. They all had major problems paying for their tuition that they needed loans
15-01-2018T18:52:44,Bgrmystr2,but the job market here pays so little
15-01-2018T18:53:18,Dadrobit,ASU is $510-$718 a credit hour. Just looked it up.
15-01-2018T18:53:45,Dadrobit,literally almost ten times cheaper
15-01-2018T18:54:17,Bgrmystr2,"XD I was never told how much they had to spend or make or whatnot, so I'm not sure"
15-01-2018T18:55:01,Dadrobit,"Oh, sorry, I pay a whopping $84 a credit hour."
15-01-2018T18:55:47,Bgrmystr2,"I couldn't even pay that once, considering how little I have :v"
15-01-2018T18:57:14,Dadrobit,"Eh, even if a loan had to be taken out, one for a degree at $84 an hour is still gonna be heaven compared to a degree at $600 an hour."
15-01-2018T18:58:35,Dadrobit,"About $57,000 vs about $8,000"
15-01-2018T18:59:14,Bgrmystr2,xD Maybe
15-01-2018T18:59:22,Dadrobit,No maybes about it lol.
15-01-2018T18:59:32,Bgrmystr2,I'm saying maybe that's how it is
15-01-2018T18:59:38,Bgrmystr2,they just didn't say anything about how much
15-01-2018T18:59:40,Bgrmystr2,so I wouldn't know
15-01-2018T19:00:33,Dadrobit,Just making a point. I hope your buddies did some real thinking before they took on loans if they looked anything like those figures.
15-01-2018T19:00:51,Bgrmystr2,you can bet that most of em didn't.
15-01-2018T19:00:59,Bgrmystr2,count on it.
15-01-2018T19:01:01,Bgrmystr2,:/
15-01-2018T19:01:15,Bgrmystr2,"some did for sure, but most didn't."
15-01-2018T19:01:31,Dadrobit,"Gonna head out to dinner with grandaddy, almost forgot about it!"
15-01-2018T19:01:35,Dadrobit,Have a good one!
15-01-2018T19:01:40,Bgrmystr2,don't be late :D
15-01-2018T19:01:46,Bgrmystr2,"enjoy yourself, Dadro"
15-01-2018T20:49:20,Dadrobit,"Back. Went to a local cantina, had a good time."
15-01-2018T20:50:12,Dadrobit,"The dude's turning 80 in a few days, so I wanted treat him to a dinner by ourselves before then."
