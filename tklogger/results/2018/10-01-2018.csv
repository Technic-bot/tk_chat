10-01-2018T19:14:05,Serpentfrog,I make my extra money through tax fraud. Another reason to do your own taxes.

10-01-2018T19:15:51,Tamerlee,7% returns is realistic over the long-term.
10-01-2018T19:16:08,Tamerlee,The S&P 500 has more than 7% average return over its life.
10-01-2018T19:16:14,Kynum,so I just heard that Photoshop got a built in stroke stabilizer.

10-01-2018T20:53:34,QiblitheSandwing,but this aint modern times

10-01-2018T20:54:14,QiblitheSandwing,"No, she says, let people look at it, or we won't know if she will get one"

10-01-2018T20:55:00,QiblitheSandwing,"And knowing unsanitary conditions cause infection is different from knowing how to use antibiotics to fight bacteria, which are microscopic ultraorganisms"
10-01-2018T20:55:19,BadFoMo,@CrRAR Zen is dying frim an infection.
10-01-2018T20:55:23,QiblitheSandwing,If antibiotics even exist. Which they don't.

10-01-2018T20:56:10,Twokinds,No one's dying
10-01-2018T20:56:12,unsteddyphoenix,That would be pretty fucked up

10-01-2018T20:57:09,QiblitheSandwing,and zen still almost died
10-01-2018T20:57:11,MuonNeutrino,maybe they'll have to chop off his leg &gt;.&gt;
10-01-2018T20:57:17,unsteddyphoenix,Thats the real question
10-01-2018T20:57:24,Serpentfrog,Can you not?
10-01-2018T20:57:27,MidnightBlue78,"He can just get the leg amputated,and problem solved"
10-01-2018T20:57:38,BadFoMo,@Twokinds //Troll Which member of the No-One family is dying?

10-01-2018T20:57:52,MuonNeutrino,yep
10-01-2018T20:57:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,@MidnightBlue78 :ctwokinds-zenshocked:

10-01-2018T20:57:57,CrRAR,uh huh
10-01-2018T20:57:58,Ordithus,*true
10-01-2018T20:58:04,Mustanglvr007,But what are they gonna replace his leg with
10-01-2018T20:58:05,Bgrmystr2,"yeah there was, phoenix"
10-01-2018T20:58:10,Aleris,peg leg
10-01-2018T20:58:10,MuonNeutrino,"there was a timeskip, yes, but not THAT long of one"
10-01-2018T20:58:16,MuonNeutrino,jus long enough for reni to fly there
10-01-2018T20:58:20,Bgrmystr2,so 40mins is probably not accurate
10-01-2018T20:58:23,MidnightBlue78,they can use a stump
10-01-2018T20:58:27,QiblitheSandwing,"I mean, his amputated wound can get infected"
10-01-2018T20:58:28,Bgrmystr2,wasn't it noon-ish to afternoon?
10-01-2018T20:58:29,Dadrobit,Timeskip only long enough to finish up the bandages.
10-01-2018T20:58:33,Twokinds,Yeah infection would be a long term thing
10-01-2018T20:58:33,MuonNeutrino,yeah
10-01-2018T20:58:35,Ordithus,Infections take days
10-01-2018T20:58:37,Bgrmystr2,a couple hours or so
10-01-2018T20:58:39,MidnightBlue78,there's plenty of trees
10-01-2018T20:58:40,Ordithus,Then he can die!
10-01-2018T20:58:42,BadFoMo,@MidnightBlue78 It would save me from having to make that sketct request.

10-01-2018T20:59:02,MuonNeutrino,@Bgrmystr2 all we have for sure is that raine had just finished zen's bandages when karen saw reni flying in
10-01-2018T20:59:13,MuonNeutrino,so how long does it take to put bandages on zen's leg?
10-01-2018T20:59:14,Bgrmystr2,Considering tom said so in the stream :v
10-01-2018T20:59:16,Mustanglvr007,He's gonna be fine
10-01-2018T20:59:21,TorqueEmUp,"yeah infections take a while, some could take months to off ya."
10-01-2018T20:59:24,Bgrmystr2,I think it's pretty solid
10-01-2018T20:59:26,Bgrmystr2,but okay
10-01-2018T20:59:33,Dadrobit,40 minutes is a fair amount of time no?
10-01-2018T20:59:47,Aleris,how much of a timeskip was there?
10-01-2018T20:59:49,Bgrmystr2,I don't know what world you live on where 40 mins is from noonish to mid-afternoon?
10-01-2018T20:59:52,QiblitheSandwing,"An initial infection would need penicillin, but if its been a while, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is pretty antibiotic resistance"
10-01-2018T20:59:59,MuonNeutrino,"either way, even if it was a couple hours he still doesn't have any effects from an infection yet"

10-01-2018T21:37:28,CanisRufusUK,"Zen might be saying he's dying but 1) that dosnt mean he's right. and 2) he's exactly the kind of drama queen who'd say it for dramatic effect, sympathy and trolling"
10-01-2018T21:37:31,Aleris,i have to go
10-01-2018T21:37:31,Bgrmystr2,mental image of Zen just going Whoooo~
10-01-2018T21:37:31,TheDixieNutjob,though I have a feeling Natani's gonna punch him in the face for scaring the snot out of her
10-01-2018T21:37:35,Aleris,geometry

10-01-2018T21:37:50,unsteddyphoenix,Thats when he gets a steampunk nose

10-01-2018T21:37:56,TheFDdriver,bye
10-01-2018T21:37:58,DevlNuK,Bye Aleris
10-01-2018T21:38:04,TheDixieNutjob,by inadvertently making her fly
10-01-2018T21:38:05,Dadrobit,I recall a long time ago I speculated that bringing Alaric back was a social test to see how well the fandom would take killing off Zen and bringing him back through Natani. Still a possibility imo.
10-01-2018T21:38:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,......
10-01-2018T21:38:30,CrRAR,You can't die if someone's punching you in the face right? Just like sleeping?
10-01-2018T21:38:35,Vexd,He can't be best boy if he's dead tho
10-01-2018T21:38:38,CrRAR,gets the adrenaline FLOWING
10-01-2018T21:38:47,unsteddyphoenix,"Lol, all those issues Natani was just now beginning to work through? Let's amp em up to 11"
10-01-2018T21:38:55,MidnightBlue78,"you can't kill  a character that everyone loves, right?"
10-01-2018T21:38:55,TheFDdriver,doesn't that kill natani?
10-01-2018T21:38:57,Dadrobit,"Pretty much, unsteddy."
10-01-2018T21:38:57,TheBeckoner,lol
10-01-2018T21:39:07,Serpentfrog,"Are you saying you kill naughty boys, Vexd?"
10-01-2018T21:39:12,Ordithus,Raine would also feel preeeety guilty if Zen died
10-01-2018T21:39:13,Dadrobit,"Naw, I figured they'd just take turns with the body."
10-01-2018T21:39:24,unsteddyphoenix,Keith and Natani must be the unhappiest couple as penance for being so popular
10-01-2018T21:39:38,CrRAR,"""Now there's a DUDE in my haed TOO!"" arggghhh"
10-01-2018T21:39:43,TheBeckoner,Im ok with alaric coming back tbh
10-01-2018T21:39:59,BluePhantom90,So wondering why Zen is holding his arm? He wasn't hurt in the arm.
10-01-2018T21:40:00,TheBeckoner,somehow...
10-01-2018T21:40:01,TheFDdriver,me too
10-01-2018T21:40:07,Dadrobit,"Figured that as Natani was slowly coming to terms w/ the body, Zen would then have to do the same thing in reverse."
10-01-2018T21:40:18,CrRAR,Zen just has all the ouchies
10-01-2018T21:40:25,CrRAR,he was straining pretty hard
10-01-2018T21:40:26,Vexd,"Nah, be easier just to gender bend him"
10-01-2018T21:40:29,Bgrmystr2,"cuz he needs something to hold on to, Blue"
10-01-2018T21:40:32,Bgrmystr2,cuz pain
10-01-2018T21:40:38,CanisRufusUK,"Blue, probably just a rexlexive action to the pain"
10-01-2018T21:40:39,Bgrmystr2,that is a thing.
10-01-2018T21:40:45,Bgrmystr2,"exactly, Canis"
10-01-2018T21:41:13,Dadrobit,"Yeah, there comes a point in having an injury so bad that even you don't want to touch it, so you grab whatever else is available. Source: Me."
10-01-2018T21:41:20,Bgrmystr2,also me
10-01-2018T21:41:29,TheBeckoner,sounds right to me too
10-01-2018T21:41:30,BluePhantom90,I would just have a clench fist or something in my hand I might crush because of the pain. not my arm
10-01-2018T21:41:33,Serpentfrog,"Well, maybe not exactly. There's an 'f' in there."
10-01-2018T21:41:35,TheFDdriver,or bite something
10-01-2018T21:41:42,Vexd,Well good for you Blue
10-01-2018T21:41:58,CrRAR,Hey the pillow might be his pants!
10-01-2018T21:42:03,Bgrmystr2,"Well not everyone is the same, Blue"
10-01-2018T21:42:19,TheFDdriver,I think Zen is doing that to release stress and pain
10-01-2018T21:42:22,Ordithus,"Neat perspective, panel 2."
10-01-2018T21:42:27,Ordithus,16mm lens
10-01-2018T21:42:27,Bgrmystr2,and it's unlikely that you would break your arm by squeezing it with your hand.
10-01-2018T21:42:33,CrRAR,Yeah panel 2 is tripping me ouuuut. haha
10-01-2018T21:42:38,Serpentfrog,Lens? Wtf?

10-01-2018T22:28:05,MuonNeutrino,though her shirt may well be unsalvagable given that the bandages sythe cut for her wounds looked ike they were from the shirt
10-01-2018T22:28:07,Bgrmystr2,depends on what kind of grass
10-01-2018T22:28:11,CrRAR,tru

10-01-2018T22:28:31,MuonNeutrino,"but her pants are probably around somewhere too, and those will fit again also now that she's human once more"

10-01-2018T22:32:56,Bgrmystr2,Why would Ron switch to Twitch from Picarto?
10-01-2018T22:33:02,Bgrmystr2,when Picarto allows gaming?
