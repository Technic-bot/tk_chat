13-08-2018T00:18:06,Vatruvius,Heyo! :ptv-greetings: Anyone still here?
13-08-2018T00:21:41,SpazztasticKiwi,No
13-08-2018T00:23:28,Vatruvius,"Drats, guess I will check back later then."
13-08-2018T00:23:47,Vatruvius,:ptv-hearts:
13-08-2018T00:24:14,Vatruvius,Tonight is the last night I am 20 yests old.
13-08-2018T00:24:25,Vatruvius,years*
13-08-2018T00:26:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"Didn‚Äôt know there was a yests gauge. Is it like beer age, or is that yeast age?"
13-08-2018T00:27:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though besides that, you need to get with the program - some of us are so past or 21st, we‚Äôre creepin up on our 22nd"
13-08-2018T00:28:08,SpazztasticKiwi,*our
13-08-2018T00:28:28,Vatruvius,I cannot speed up time got myself...sorry.
13-08-2018T00:28:37,Vatruvius,for *
13-08-2018T00:30:38,SpazztasticKiwi,That reminds me that Mark mentioned the text system asks for your birthday so he can send happy birthday texts
13-08-2018T00:30:52,Vatruvius,"Unfortunately, my grandfather passed away today. Not much of s hit to me, didn't really know him, bug my dad is taking ot hard. And all of this is happening during the family vacation. So emotions everywhere!"
13-08-2018T00:30:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I just hope it‚Äôs not right at 12:00 am on the dot
13-08-2018T00:31:07,Vatruvius,"Ohh yeah, didn't get into that."
13-08-2018T00:31:14,Vatruvius,lol
13-08-2018T00:31:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Gonna wake up ready to murder someone
13-08-2018T00:31:43,Vatruvius,He wants to know the minute you were born so you get a true happy birthday.
13-08-2018T00:32:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I was actually born at about 2 something that afternoon
13-08-2018T00:32:24,Vatruvius,"Nice, I was born around 4 am."
13-08-2018T00:32:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Poor mom
13-08-2018T00:33:08,SpazztasticKiwi,N sorry bout üë¥
13-08-2018T00:33:32,Vatruvius,"Yeah, I was the first so she went all natural...very quickly she started to ask for pain relief."
13-08-2018T00:33:44,Vatruvius,"Thanks, he lived to 83."
13-08-2018T00:34:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Only grandparent I‚Äôm really close to is my moms mom. Dad‚Äôs mom is gone (fell and DNR meant they let her pass) and my mom‚Äôs dad passed of COPD
13-08-2018T00:35:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Only in their 70s. Smokers too
13-08-2018T00:35:09,Vatruvius,I do not know what COPD is...
13-08-2018T00:35:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
13-08-2018T00:36:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Basically your lungs slowly fill with liquid
13-08-2018T00:36:18,Vatruvius,"I am close with two grandparents however, and one I admire. Both my moms side. My mom's mom, her husband, and my mom's dad I admire."
13-08-2018T00:36:24,NightMeaty22,wonders in
13-08-2018T00:36:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Big problem with smokers
13-08-2018T00:37:18,Vatruvius,"Bad way to go, though mine eventually let go after over a week of his body shutting down to cancer.  And I mean a lot of cancer."
13-08-2018T00:38:26,SpazztasticKiwi,That runs in my family too. Mom‚Äôs mom had a cancerous bump on her nose years ago. It was removed and hasn‚Äôt grown back but they still call her in for checks
13-08-2018T00:38:35,Vatruvius,"He was a smoker too, to be honest my dad and his siblings thought he would die 15 years ago from all the other things yhat hr has done/happened to him."
13-08-2018T00:39:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Dad‚Äôs mom had breast cancer. One had to be removed and she was relatively ok then
13-08-2018T00:39:54,Vatruvius,"My mom had cancer on her nose, looked like a witch's mole. For years she had it, then recently she accidentally scratched it off."
13-08-2018T00:40:43,SpazztasticKiwi,With the amount of smokers in my family I‚Äôm surprised any of them are surviving to have kids
13-08-2018T00:42:00,Vatruvius,It is weird to think that I can go into any store and buy alcohol tommarow...I don't know why that feels so weird but it does. I guess because alcohol is made to br such a big thing?
13-08-2018T00:42:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Dad‚Äôs side drink like fish
13-08-2018T00:42:27,Vatruvius,be*
13-08-2018T00:42:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve tried beer once. That shit‚Äôs nasty
13-08-2018T00:42:54,Vatruvius,So are you into wine then?
13-08-2018T00:43:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Never had it
13-08-2018T00:43:17,Vatruvius,Not much of a drinker then?
13-08-2018T00:43:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not terribly enthused with drinking
13-08-2018T00:43:36,Vatruvius,Me neither.
13-08-2018T00:43:37,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs never appealed to me
13-08-2018T00:43:48,Vatruvius,Same.
13-08-2018T00:44:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"Might try it if a guy takes me to a date or picnic but other than that, I‚Äôll generally just choose a coke"
13-08-2018T00:44:38,Vatruvius,It is odd because my mom and I just bought some alcohol tonight and I can do that tommarow without her.
13-08-2018T00:45:18,Vatruvius,"The alcohol wasn't for me, mostly my sister and mom."
13-08-2018T00:45:54,NightMeaty22,Hello how are you doing
13-08-2018T00:46:09,Vatruvius,Turning 21 soon Meaty.
13-08-2018T00:46:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Eh. Off work. That‚Äôs about it
13-08-2018T00:46:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I know Mark‚Äôs drink of choice seemed to be fireball whiskey
13-08-2018T00:46:46,NightMeaty22,Coke is good
13-08-2018T00:46:53,NightMeaty22,üëç
13-08-2018T00:46:57,SpazztasticKiwi,For that drunk Minecraft until it made him sick
13-08-2018T00:46:58,Vatruvius,"Well, not anymore but yeah."
13-08-2018T00:47:07,Vatruvius,lol
13-08-2018T00:47:17,Vatruvius,That shit...
13-08-2018T00:48:11,Vatruvius,"I am excited about my webcomic though, it is getting there. Every week is another week closer to drawing and playing around with it."
13-08-2018T00:48:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"I wonder why he drank knowing his mom couldn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a genetic thing, the inability to digest alcohol."
13-08-2018T00:48:35,Vatruvius,In about a month I will have my drawing tablet/monitor.
13-08-2018T00:49:18,NightMeaty22,When you sign up for a drawing class then the school takes it away form you
13-08-2018T00:49:31,NightMeaty22,üòü
13-08-2018T00:49:45,Vatruvius,A young thing? Your brain does not fully develope until 25 give or take a year. The development of risk analysis that is.
13-08-2018T00:50:29,Vatruvius,"Yeah, but I am not doing through school unless I need to. Just going to start on my own at first."
13-08-2018T00:51:07,Vatruvius,I should get my drawing hand greased and up to speed before I take classes.
13-08-2018T00:51:37,NightMeaty22,I dont know why but it feels like the school is against me i have none of the classes i signed up for
13-08-2018T00:52:59,NightMeaty22,Oh well
13-08-2018T00:53:21,Vatruvius,"You can sign up for them but you are not gaurenteed to get them. Same with college, though there stands better chances if you sign up the second they allow you to."
13-08-2018T00:54:30,Vatruvius,"Anyway, was just letting my grandfather thing off my chest and talk birthday stuff and what not. Goodnight everyone! :ptv-greetings:"
13-08-2018T00:55:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Laters. I‚Äôll be off soon too
13-08-2018T00:55:33,NightMeaty22,Thats true but... half of the classes just disappeared like the school got rid of them
13-08-2018T00:56:29,NightMeaty22,But like i said oh well
13-08-2018T00:57:50,NightMeaty22,I should get to bed as well good night
13-08-2018T00:58:06,NightMeaty22,wonders out
13-08-2018T00:58:09,Vatruvius,"Right before I leave, meaning I will not be herefor the response, my college drops classes if not enough students sign up for them. It would cost the school to run those classes with so few students. There is a minimum threshold of students required to"
13-08-2018T00:58:21,Vatruvius,keep a class up.
13-08-2018T00:58:37,Vatruvius,Hope thst clears some things. Goodnight!
13-08-2018T00:59:17,NightMeaty22,I'll make it work
13-08-2018T01:00:08,NightMeaty22,Good morning!!! It's 12:00am
13-08-2018T01:00:18,NightMeaty22,Ok bye

13-08-2018T15:10:49,CrimsonQuill,I'm probably the only one on this chat at the moment...
13-08-2018T15:18:24,Bgrmystr2,"Can confirm, you are."
13-08-2018T15:20:42,CrimsonQuill,@Bgrmystr2 Doing much?
13-08-2018T16:05:45,Bgrmystr2,"I'm not here, and I'm doing a lot."
13-08-2018T16:05:56,CrimsonQuill,ok
13-08-2018T16:06:20,CrimsonQuill,"I'm just desperately hanging about, hoping that someone'll be on for chat."

13-08-2018T20:37:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Never got to telling you guys last night that I heard a little girl ask her mom ‚Äúif it was weird if she was bilingual‚Äù
13-08-2018T20:47:48,MallardDuckAvia,Is there no sketch today?
13-08-2018T20:50:29,Bgrmystr2,today's not friday or sunday
13-08-2018T20:52:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom hasn‚Äôt been on in about two days now, and he doesn‚Äôt stream Tuesdays"
13-08-2018T21:56:01,MallardDuckAvia,I meant one from Sunday being posted
13-08-2018T22:39:28,MallardDuckAvia,Hello?
13-08-2018T23:05:47,Bgrmystr2,seems like he hasn't posted anything on patreon or deviantart today
13-08-2018T23:05:55,Bgrmystr2,perhaps something happened
13-08-2018T23:06:05,Bgrmystr2,sick perhaps
13-08-2018T23:06:22,Bgrmystr2,he was saying his eyesight was blurry on sunday
13-08-2018T23:06:29,Bgrmystr2,like it was going in and out
13-08-2018T23:06:53,Bgrmystr2,so perhaps whatever it was finally hit him
13-08-2018T23:07:19,Bgrmystr2,hope everything's alright :ptv-wondering::ptv-uneasy:
13-08-2018T23:08:42,MallardDuckAvia,Hope he feels better too
13-08-2018T23:39:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"Hopefully he actually went to a doctor. Mark uploaded today - as weak as a tell that is, so maybe he‚Äôs not in the hospital or anything"
13-08-2018T23:49:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Though there is a post from yesterday so he‚Äôs probably ok
