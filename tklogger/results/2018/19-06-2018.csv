19-06-2018T17:14:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m debating changing my suggestion again
19-06-2018T17:19:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I may just keep it as is for a bit for the sake of familiarity
19-06-2018T17:24:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, anyone here ever had quiche"
19-06-2018T17:32:10,Xexanoth,that's one hell of a segway but yeah...
19-06-2018T17:55:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Are they good at all - they more like custard or pudding
19-06-2018T18:02:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Nm - back to work
19-06-2018T18:06:13,Xexanoth,"neither? not sure we're talking about the same ""quiche"""
19-06-2018T19:45:43,CrRAR,A quiche is like... an omelette for dinner! Thicker like a cake though with more ingredients~
19-06-2018T19:46:36,CrRAR,"On that note, I just heard some kids at the supermarket say, ""Dinosaurs don't wear clothes and they're not naked!""."
19-06-2018T19:46:45,CrRAR,My faith in the youth has improved slightly this day.
19-06-2018T19:47:45,Bgrmystr2,"well.. that's cuz dinosaurs don't have a ""naked"" vs ""not naked"" like humans have self-imposed on themselves"
19-06-2018T19:47:49,Bgrmystr2,dinos don't give a shit
19-06-2018T19:47:54,Bgrmystr2,neither do animals
19-06-2018T19:48:12,Bgrmystr2,the only reason we do is cuz we're dumb prudes :)
19-06-2018T19:49:03,CrRAR,lol
19-06-2018T19:52:41,CrRAR,"Indeed, the pureness of the thought... he even said it with a thoughtful hesitation... like a mini-Aristotle. xD"

19-06-2018T21:04:00,Ordithus,I could not help but feel... sad and disappointed when I saw his plane though.
