01-06-2018T00:11:03,FenceEqualizer,That should not be hilarious to me
01-06-2018T00:11:06,Dadrobit,"Which was why she got the spot for her character, but it was unnerving working with her."
01-06-2018T00:11:11,unsteddyphoenix,Wake her up inside :/

01-06-2018T00:11:49,FenceEqualizer,Just imagine a woman apathetically doing all her lines
01-06-2018T00:12:07,unsteddyphoenix,Those types of characters do exist in anime...
01-06-2018T00:12:12,Trevuxnouxe,thx for streaming!
01-06-2018T00:12:14,Bgrmystr2,what happened to her dadro? Do you know? Like.. was it the work that did it?
01-06-2018T00:12:19,Bgrmystr2,or was she like that from the getgo
01-06-2018T00:12:29,Dadrobit,It's just.... Having her dead eye stare into my soul while delivering the lines.... It was different.
01-06-2018T00:12:38,Dadrobit,eye*
01-06-2018T00:12:42,Dadrobit,eyes*****
01-06-2018T00:12:45,ItsActuallyKopyKat,that would be...different
01-06-2018T00:12:55,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
01-06-2018T00:12:59,FenceEqualizer,Again...should not find that funny
01-06-2018T00:13:07,SpazztasticKiwi,What kind of theme was the lines? Was it a battle scene thing or what?
01-06-2018T00:13:09,unsteddyphoenix,she clearly established dominance
01-06-2018T00:13:13,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"no one's laughing, fence"
01-06-2018T00:13:17,Bgrmystr2,xD Phoenix
01-06-2018T00:13:31,Dadrobit,"Nah, no battling, she was a hyper introvert with no friends in the game."
01-06-2018T00:13:34,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"except bgr, i guess"
01-06-2018T00:13:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"Cause if it was a sexual scene, I have a joke"
01-06-2018T00:13:42,FenceEqualizer,I am. Kopy.
01-06-2018T00:13:42,Dadrobit,Except me.
01-06-2018T00:13:46,Bgrmystr2,"fence is probably referencing himself, Kopy"
01-06-2018T00:13:48,Bgrmystr2,see
01-06-2018T00:13:52,ItsActuallyKopyKat,hmm
01-06-2018T00:14:00,Vatruvius,I can only imagine how painstaking it would be to make that carpet for that curved staircase...
01-06-2018T00:14:03,Twokinds,Dooooone
01-06-2018T00:14:03,FenceEqualizer,Which is why I feel great shame
01-06-2018T00:14:06,Bgrmystr2,"and I was laughing at what phoenix said, sheesh"
01-06-2018T00:14:06,Dadrobit,"Yeah, you could bang all the girls in the game, even her. So yeah, there were those lines as well."

01-06-2018T00:15:12,Bgrmystr2,"hopefully the text, Fomo"
01-06-2018T00:15:14,Dadrobit,"Then, if you went through each girl in individual playthroughs, it unlocked the harem ending. That was fun."
01-06-2018T00:15:16,InTheLionsDen,Great looking page Tom.
01-06-2018T00:15:25,Ordithus,"Vatru, Artificial Incident is much shorter"
01-06-2018T00:15:28,unsteddyphoenix,That does sounds fun
01-06-2018T00:15:31,FenceEqualizer,Ah so it was a visual novel?
01-06-2018T00:15:35,Dadrobit,"Vat, all of them. At the same time."
01-06-2018T00:15:42,Vatruvius,Is AI done?
01-06-2018T00:15:42,SpotTheLeopard,I love how you always say done and then continue to tweak it a bit further~ very nice tho

01-06-2018T00:16:13,Bgrmystr2,"so I guess it was animated, dadro? :o"
01-06-2018T00:16:26,Vatruvius,"I see, so it is newer then?"
01-06-2018T00:16:29,FenceEqualizer,They're usually not that animated
01-06-2018T00:16:30,Ordithus,Much
01-06-2018T00:16:38,Dadrobit,"Was in video game design back at ASU, made by one of my classmates in the video game design club."
01-06-2018T00:16:59,Dadrobit,"Only very light animations, most all just static images."
01-06-2018T00:17:07,Vatruvius,"And ASU is brought up again, quickly, bury that part of my past."
01-06-2018T00:17:10,Vatruvius,No one saw it!

01-06-2018T00:19:40,Vatruvius,I was not a party goer Dadro so what I got out of one semester was that it is hot and the AC did not work in my building. Did get a taste of faster internet though.

01-06-2018T00:20:08,Dadrobit,Was in the marching band. Parties were mandatory.
01-06-2018T00:20:10,unsteddyphoenix,weird perspective?
01-06-2018T00:20:18,Twokinds,It's hard to get them spaced out correctly
01-06-2018T00:20:21,Vatruvius,"Those windows look awesome Tom, you did greate."
01-06-2018T00:20:32,Trevuxnouxe,whats this a picture of

01-06-2018T00:20:35,Twokinds,"I eventually just made the lines flat, then transformed them into perspective."
01-06-2018T00:20:43,mingun,Open window looks strange -- not rectangular.

01-06-2018T00:21:20,Bgrmystr2,the open window looks too short yeah
01-06-2018T00:21:22,Vatruvius,"Nah, the window looks right, maybe too short but lined up correctly."
01-06-2018T00:21:24,Bgrmystr2,but otherwise seems ok
01-06-2018T00:22:07,FoxxTrotter,"I'ma heading out. Sage, Tom...thanks for the streams. G'night, everyone. :0)"

01-06-2018T01:08:26,Bgrmystr2,it would make sense for her to have worn them if they belong to her.
01-06-2018T01:08:29,unsteddyphoenix,Who's pantyhose are those

01-06-2018T01:33:21,ZRO4825,Deep and morbid thoughts for 2:30 in the morning
01-06-2018T01:33:25,Vatruvius,That is a dark way to look at life; true but dark.
01-06-2018T01:34:11,JamesBSquirrel3,"Okay, very funny as you like, GOODNIGHT"
01-06-2018T01:34:12,ZRO4825,"To be fair, the man's sick. Doesn't really encourage you to look on the bright side of life. :P"
01-06-2018T01:34:22,ZRO4825,"Have a good night, James!"
01-06-2018T01:34:23,Ordithus,Night James

01-06-2018T01:35:35,ZRO4825,"Because at his height, I admit I'd be lookin right at da titties."
01-06-2018T01:35:40,Ordithus,I see we had similar thoughts
01-06-2018T01:35:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I half regret opening that deviant art link
01-06-2018T01:36:02,ZRO4825,I regret nothing.
01-06-2018T01:36:03,Vatruvius,"Okay, Tom is done streaming. Time to leave....:ptv-tease:"
01-06-2018T01:36:10,Ordithus,Night Vatru

01-06-2018T01:36:31,Vatruvius,I am not actually leaving.
01-06-2018T01:36:37,Ordithus,"Not Night, Vatru"
01-06-2018T01:36:47,ZRO4825,Of course you're not. Because we're going to tie you to the chair.
01-06-2018T01:36:53,JamesBSquirrel3,"We just hope we ready for results on Sunday, surely will! BYE:ptv-hearts:"
01-06-2018T01:40:13,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Yeah...problems happen when you don't lol
01-06-2018T01:40:18,ItsActuallyKopyKat,whisp fail
01-06-2018T01:40:20,Vatruvius,lol
01-06-2018T01:41:01,Ordithus,how embarassing :ptv-ohmy:
01-06-2018T01:41:01,ZRO4825,I usually blame Picarto for that. It's easier than admitting I fucked up. :P
01-06-2018T01:41:29,Bgrmystr2,"I click the person, it has /whisper, I type something, then the /whisper fails and goes to all chat anyway"
01-06-2018T01:41:31,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"lol zro, I'll start doing that"
01-06-2018T01:41:44,Bgrmystr2,it's rare but still happens
01-06-2018T01:41:47,ItsActuallyKopyKat,@bgrmystr2 exactly!
01-06-2018T01:41:53,ItsActuallyKopyKat,so annoying
01-06-2018T01:42:09,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"or better yet, click right as someone else chats, and send your whisper to them"
01-06-2018T01:42:23,Bgrmystr2,it would be prevented if the /whisper didn't disappear when you pressed enter
01-06-2018T01:42:27,Mihari,Why not just click on their name?
01-06-2018T01:42:27,Bgrmystr2,:/
01-06-2018T01:42:28,Vatruvius,"Sometimes, I just get caught up in the whisper and forget to click the name. Has happened enough I check to make sure the message is a whisper before I hit enter."
01-06-2018T01:42:39,Bgrmystr2,that's exactly how we're doing it Mihari
01-06-2018T01:43:02,Bgrmystr2,"well, that's what I'm doin"
01-06-2018T01:43:25,Bgrmystr2,"And yeah I do that vatru, and it still goes to all chat randomly"
01-06-2018T01:43:26,Mihari,Cause you can also click on a persons avatar and it brings up that mini menu
01-06-2018T01:44:03,Bgrmystr2,yeh that menu is actually useful
01-06-2018T01:44:16,ZRO4825,Unlike some of the people I've met in life. :V
01-06-2018T01:44:18,Ordithus,"Get well soon, Sage.  Good night, all! :ctwokinds-RainezZz:"

01-06-2018T01:52:40,ZRO4825,http://yosh.katbox.net/comic/happy-new-year-2017/  This was definitely one of my favorite New Years pics. :joy:
01-06-2018T01:53:35,Vatruvius,lol
01-06-2018T01:54:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel like watching The Great Gatsby again
01-06-2018T01:54:12,Vatruvius,Great book and movie.
01-06-2018T01:54:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Favorite
01-06-2018T01:54:36,Vatruvius,"I don't know about favorite, but it is up there fore me."
01-06-2018T01:55:29,Vatruvius,Shawshank Redemption is my favorite movie followed by The Last Samurai. At least that is what immediately comes to mind.
01-06-2018T01:55:37,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"alright folks, i'm off to bed...what a day"
01-06-2018T01:55:44,Vatruvius,Goodnight Kopy.

01-06-2018T01:56:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"For movies overall, Gatsby is my favorite. Horror movie wise probably has the be Freddy vs Jason"
01-06-2018T01:57:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Fav horror series is probably the Saw series
01-06-2018T01:57:14,Vatruvius,"Yeah, I am not a horror movie person but Alien Isolation is by far my favorite horror game."
01-06-2018T01:57:40,SageSaga,done
01-06-2018T01:57:44,SpazztasticKiwi,More of an Intil Dawn person. Watched 6 youtubers go through that game

01-06-2018T01:59:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe something light or liquid like soup
01-06-2018T01:59:16,SageSaga,gnight folks take care
01-06-2018T01:59:56,Bgrmystr2,"alright sage, take it easy, don't overdo it"

01-06-2018T02:00:21,Bgrmystr2,but take care of yourself first and foremost
01-06-2018T02:00:23,Bgrmystr2,:U
01-06-2018T02:00:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"Night Sage! Don’t die, m’k?"
01-06-2018T02:08:35,w0lfmare,Night
01-06-2018T02:20:33,Dadrobit,Back
01-06-2018T02:20:54,Dadrobit,"If you're still around, hope you feel better Sage."
01-06-2018T02:21:46,Dadrobit,"Also, I feel like I just got gypped out of a perfect test score."
01-06-2018T02:22:10,Dadrobit,Missed one question that had two technically correct answers.
01-06-2018T02:24:26,Dadrobit,"Middle C is notated: ""Midway between the bass and treble clef"" OR ""The first ledger line above the bass clef and the first ledger line below the treble clef."""
01-06-2018T02:25:17,Dadrobit,Same damned thing looking at a Great Staff.
01-06-2018T02:25:25,Dadrobit,Mildly salty.
01-06-2018T02:30:28,Bgrmystr2,take that up with administration. Not all tests are made perfectly
01-06-2018T02:30:41,Bgrmystr2,and not all teachers grade perfectly either
01-06-2018T02:43:56,DarthRexKing,I am going to bed. Bye.
01-06-2018T02:46:50,Dadrobit,Night
01-06-2018T02:51:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I need to go on too
01-06-2018T02:52:32,Dadrobit,Night spazz
01-06-2018T03:27:46,Dadrobit,"Oh, and bgr, I'm not gonna contest it. While both are technically correct, one is technically a little more correct than the other."
01-06-2018T03:28:32,Dadrobit,"My mistake was that the one slightly more correct answer came after the first less correct answer, so I didn't bother reading all of the answers beyond the one I ""knew"" was correct."
01-06-2018T03:28:46,Dadrobit,GGWP test.
01-06-2018T03:42:03,Bgrmystr2,:/
01-06-2018T03:42:27,Bgrmystr2,since when are tests about the 'more correct
01-06-2018T03:42:44,Bgrmystr2,'more correct answer' rather than just being right instead of wrong.
01-06-2018T03:42:56,Bgrmystr2,apostrophe goddamnit
01-06-2018T03:42:59,Bgrmystr2,&gt;:/
01-06-2018T03:43:40,Bgrmystr2,"also, pluggin all mah shit up atm. Trying to figure out how I want desk and stuffffffff"
01-06-2018T03:44:27,Bgrmystr2,it's nice when you first move into a house and just.. you have free reign to your setup however you want it
01-06-2018T03:46:13,Dadrobit,Because you can have more than just the middle C ledger written between the staffs so that is is no longer ~visually~ midway between the staffs.
01-06-2018T03:48:09,Bgrmystr2,hm.. :thinking:
01-06-2018T03:48:25,Bgrmystr2,Kinda wish I had schooling on music
01-06-2018T03:48:32,Bgrmystr2,but I sorta understand
01-06-2018T03:48:34,Dadrobit,Example https://imgur.com/a/YjBgyAY
01-06-2018T03:48:49,Bgrmystr2,"oh shit, okay yeah"
01-06-2018T03:48:55,Bgrmystr2,this was above what we did
01-06-2018T03:49:00,Bgrmystr2,we only had one in bad class
01-06-2018T03:49:06,Bgrmystr2,band* even
01-06-2018T03:49:07,Bgrmystr2,asjklbfjka
01-06-2018T03:49:35,Bgrmystr2,"I knew of the bottom one, but I never learned anything about it or what it's for"
01-06-2018T03:49:50,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I only ever worked in Bass clef playing the Euphonium, but transposing to treble is super easy."
01-06-2018T03:50:18,Bgrmystr2,"and the alto sax doesn't really go too far higher or lower so.. I mean, it might go higher but that's kinda besides the point"
01-06-2018T03:50:21,Dadrobit,"It's all the same notes/alphabet, just moved a bit."
01-06-2018T03:50:39,Dadrobit,Euphonium has a ridiculous range...
01-06-2018T03:50:41,Bgrmystr2,xD
01-06-2018T03:51:37,Bgrmystr2,how much of a range? Like.... piano level range?
01-06-2018T03:52:04,Bgrmystr2,cuz I know sax is about.. 2 maybe 3 octaves if you train your lungs
01-06-2018T03:52:13,Bgrmystr2,but pianos are huge
01-06-2018T03:53:08,Bgrmystr2,"I'm unlikely to push 3 at all, I could barely push the higher end of the 2nd octave"
01-06-2018T03:53:23,Bgrmystr2,"back when I was in band, even"
01-06-2018T03:53:31,Bgrmystr2,definitely can't now lol
01-06-2018T03:54:16,Dadrobit,"3 octave range was generally my limit, but I could push into the upper fourth when I got lucky/stopped caring about tone."
01-06-2018T03:54:43,Dadrobit,Professionals can make it sound like a damned piccolo.
01-06-2018T03:54:54,Dadrobit,I only played for about 11 years.
01-06-2018T03:55:17,Bgrmystr2,lol. I played for probably... 2 years. :u
01-06-2018T03:55:24,Bgrmystr2,maybe 2 1/2
01-06-2018T03:55:34,Bgrmystr2,I was also using a student sax
01-06-2018T03:55:41,Bgrmystr2,so it doesn't go much further than 2 octaves
01-06-2018T03:55:45,Bgrmystr2,like.. if it does at all
01-06-2018T03:56:24,Bgrmystr2,not like I couldn't play 90% of the notes the horn had on it
01-06-2018T03:57:42,Bgrmystr2,"the highest were the hardest, cuz it required such a certain way to blow into the mouthpiece.."
01-06-2018T03:58:02,Bgrmystr2,really wish I didn't stop
01-06-2018T03:58:08,Dadrobit,"Never touched a reed instrument in my life, can't speak to how it compares to using a brass mouthpiece."
01-06-2018T03:58:32,Bgrmystr2,"yeh, would say the same, but opposite here"
01-06-2018T03:58:35,Dadrobit,"Did try my hand at the flute when I had a girlfriend that played it, but all my instruments were brass."
01-06-2018T03:59:10,Bgrmystr2,"what got you into music, in general?"
01-06-2018T03:59:16,Bgrmystr2,jus curious
01-06-2018T04:00:32,Dadrobit,"My elementary school was named after John Philip Sousa, and we had a sousaphone in our library with a ""Do Not Touch"" sign on it."
01-06-2018T04:00:53,Dadrobit,So I wanted to play the Tuba to one day be able to play the sousaphone.
01-06-2018T04:01:28,Dadrobit,"But I was tiny at the time, so the music teacher gave me a euphonium as a ""trainer tuba."""
01-06-2018T04:01:41,Dadrobit,And I just stuck with it forever.
01-06-2018T04:02:18,Bgrmystr2,hm. interesting
01-06-2018T04:02:32,Dadrobit,Excepting the times I had to substitute in on trumpet and tuba for the lower tier concert bands in middle/high school band performances where someone would inevitably be sick.
01-06-2018T04:02:41,Bgrmystr2,sorta wish I had that kinda story.
01-06-2018T04:03:02,Bgrmystr2,I don't have any kind of.. point where I got super into music
01-06-2018T04:03:04,Bgrmystr2,I
01-06-2018T04:03:12,Bgrmystr2,hate apostrophe button
01-06-2018T04:03:13,Dadrobit,"I really miss playing it. Like, it hurts me to not play anymore."
01-06-2018T04:03:44,Dadrobit,"Use to get into the state honor bands playing it, and then just.... stopped."
01-06-2018T04:04:36,Bgrmystr2,"I've always lliked music, even as a kid.. dunno exactly. I mean, I have fond memories of listening to that Rock&Roll station when I was a kid, and listening to different music genres as a kid.."
01-06-2018T04:04:59,Bgrmystr2,"I mean.. 8bit stuff from SNES SimCity and SC2k, the rock/techno from C&C Red Alert.."
01-06-2018T04:05:15,Bgrmystr2,Simcity 3000 had that nice jazz stuff
01-06-2018T04:05:27,Dadrobit,"I mean, I guess I haven't completely left music since I'm in the audio production course at college now. But it's not the same."
01-06-2018T04:05:29,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. there was all the music on the SNES games too that I liked.. :c
01-06-2018T04:05:43,Bgrmystr2,I dunno it was just accumulitive from my childhood I guess
01-06-2018T04:05:55,Dadrobit,"Yeah, some of those old games got creative given their limitations."
01-06-2018T04:06:07,Bgrmystr2,yeh
01-06-2018T04:06:28,Bgrmystr2,"in fact, I still consider the soundtrack to Streets of SimCity as one of my favorites"
01-06-2018T04:06:44,Bgrmystr2,even though it's so badly recorded cuz of the time it was made
01-06-2018T04:06:57,Bgrmystr2,"the music itself, the way it was put together.."
01-06-2018T04:06:58,Bgrmystr2,was SO nice
01-06-2018T04:07:20,Bgrmystr2,the dude who made it made the SC3k and SC4 soundtrack too
01-06-2018T04:07:25,Bgrmystr2,as well as The Sims soundtracj
01-06-2018T04:07:30,Bgrmystr2,track*
01-06-2018T04:07:37,Bgrmystr2,he's got hella talent
01-06-2018T04:10:48,Dadrobit,:/ Even have my old John Phillip Sousa trophy on my desk still... https://i.imgur.com/4nunpb3.jpg
01-06-2018T04:11:17,Bgrmystr2,odamn
01-06-2018T04:11:20,Bgrmystr2,what you got that for?
01-06-2018T04:11:27,Dadrobit,"Also, even as good as the music was back in yonder day, (Final Fantasy Tactics mmmmmm) You gotta say that modern music kicks ass as well."
01-06-2018T04:11:38,Dadrobit,Top performing musician in the school.
01-06-2018T04:12:27,Bgrmystr2,oh nice
01-06-2018T04:12:45,Bgrmystr2,yeh there's some pretty good modern stuff
01-06-2018T04:13:08,Bgrmystr2,a lot of it doesn't have.. like.. the setup I think is nice though
01-06-2018T04:13:39,Bgrmystr2,you know like.. you listen to a song and you can just tell whether the creator was putting their heart and soul into this piece
01-06-2018T04:14:10,Dadrobit,"The Soulsborne series doesn't have that problem, that's for sure."
01-06-2018T04:15:19,Bgrmystr2,"a lot of people make music, and they do well, but a lot of times music just.. lacks. There's no proper buildups, no wind downs, no rests in the middle, solos have almost gone the way of the dodo from what it seems like.."
01-06-2018T04:15:59,Bgrmystr2,"there's so much that makes music draw you in, builds up momentum, and then really hits you with awesome, and that seems like a rarity now"
01-06-2018T04:16:34,Dadrobit,"Hm, there's a lot of that in mobile games for sure."
01-06-2018T04:16:52,Dadrobit,"But then there are also a lot of ""Journey""'s as well."
01-06-2018T04:17:13,Dadrobit,"Shit, that almost won a Grammy iirc."
01-06-2018T04:17:48,Dadrobit,Lost to a country soundtrack for a movie I think. It was bullshit.
01-06-2018T04:18:37,Dadrobit,Baba Yetu from Civilization.
01-06-2018T04:19:16,Dadrobit,Pretty much anything from the Elder Scrolls series.
01-06-2018T04:19:24,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: didn't play any of those
01-06-2018T04:20:49,Dadrobit,Morrowind will always hold a spot in my heart for adventure themes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJD-Ufi1jGk
01-06-2018T04:21:43,Dadrobit,That fanfare around 1:10 hits me every time.
01-06-2018T04:22:11,Dadrobit,"And yes, you better believe I learned to play it on euphonium lol."
01-06-2018T04:25:32,Bgrmystr2,oooh this one
01-06-2018T04:25:59,Bgrmystr2,"I know this song, I've heard it before"
01-06-2018T04:26:56,Bgrmystr2,"seems nice, a bit slow for my tastes, but it's pretty good"
01-06-2018T04:27:19,Bgrmystr2,I think that one's purposefully light on the intensity
01-06-2018T04:29:00,Dadrobit,"It's very purposeful. Game's hella long, you'd get fatigued listening to high octane 100% of the time in a 150hr plythrough."
01-06-2018T04:29:03,Dadrobit,playthrough*
01-06-2018T04:32:45,Bgrmystr2,yeh
01-06-2018T04:33:44,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I dunno.. do a playthrough of that game while listening to nothing but Initial-D-esque style eurobeat the entire way through"
01-06-2018T04:33:57,Bgrmystr2,will that affect your gameplay at all? xD
01-06-2018T04:34:13,Dadrobit,"Yes, I guarantee it."
01-06-2018T04:34:17,Bgrmystr2,hahaha
01-06-2018T04:34:20,Bgrmystr2,sounds like a fun time
01-06-2018T04:34:34,Dadrobit,You start out moving at a snail's pace. It would be a hard contrast to swallow.
01-06-2018T04:34:53,Bgrmystr2,yeah
01-06-2018T04:34:56,Dadrobit,"Until you get the ""Boots of Blinding Speed""."
01-06-2018T04:35:26,Dadrobit,"They increase your speed by 200, but they also apply a blind affect to your character when worn."
01-06-2018T04:35:37,Dadrobit,"So you move real quick, but you can't see shit."
01-06-2018T04:35:48,Bgrmystr2,"oh, just turn sideways, no need to see xD"
01-06-2018T04:35:56,Bgrmystr2,you'll go exactly where you need to go
01-06-2018T04:36:05,Bgrmystr2,..probably.
01-06-2018T04:37:13,Dadrobit,Probably not. You just need to wear something with an anti-blind effect of 50% or greater to get some of your vision back.
01-06-2018T04:37:46,Dadrobit,"Unless you're a beast race, then you're screwed anyways since they can't wear shoes/boots/most helmets."
01-06-2018T04:38:19,Bgrmystr2,rip
01-06-2018T04:38:34,Bgrmystr2,fuzzy people can't drift :(
01-06-2018T04:38:49,Bgrmystr2,damn game limitations
01-06-2018T04:38:53,Dadrobit,"Ohhhhh, now I get the ""Sideways"" bit."
01-06-2018T04:39:10,Bgrmystr2,hahaha
01-06-2018T04:39:24,Dadrobit,"Well, if you're looking for other insane ost's, check out Doom 2016. It's friggin nuts."
01-06-2018T04:39:32,Dadrobit,Won a couple of awards as well.
01-06-2018T04:40:30,Bgrmystr2,yeah I heard it when I watched a friend of mine go through the game
01-06-2018T04:51:52,Bgrmystr2,"nearly 5am, should hit the bed before it gets too late"
01-06-2018T04:52:10,Bgrmystr2,it knows what it did &gt;;/
01-06-2018T04:52:46,SiliconCarbide,going to bed now will fuck it your sleep cycle though
01-06-2018T04:53:21,Dadrobit,Night
01-06-2018T05:00:43,Bgrmystr2,"no it won't sil, cuz this is when I usually sleep. Between 5 and 6am"
01-06-2018T05:01:07,Bgrmystr2,you guys take it easy :ptv-greetings:
01-06-2018T05:01:10,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-sleepy:

01-06-2018T14:04:29,CrRAR,"Ha, if Karen never opened her eyes the monologue would be infinite..."
01-06-2018T14:04:33,CrRAR,"""...and ANOTHER THING..."""
01-06-2018T14:04:35,CrRAR,XD

01-06-2018T14:15:12,SpazztasticKiwi,But porcupine Trace is interesting to have pop up on your notifications
01-06-2018T14:15:18,SageSaga,No internet so stream will start when the internet comes back
01-06-2018T14:15:43,FoxxTrotter,"OK, Sage. Hopefully, things will work out quickly."
01-06-2018T14:25:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Are you feeling any better sage?
01-06-2018T14:29:11,FoxxTrotter,Sage is off the chat at the moment.
01-06-2018T14:31:05,SageSaga,I'm dehydrated but feel better
01-06-2018T14:38:33,Bgrmystr2,"well, glad you're feelin better, also gmornin"

01-06-2018T14:43:42,SpazztasticKiwi,You’re not dying anymore - yea
01-06-2018T14:44:20,SpazztasticKiwi,May have just been food poisoning or a 24 hour bug
01-06-2018T14:44:37,Bgrmystr2,gonna have to shut down my pc to rewire it elsewhere
01-06-2018T14:44:46,Bgrmystr2,gonna lurk on a non-account laptop tho
01-06-2018T14:51:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll be back at lunch

01-06-2018T15:53:32,SageSaga,you never replied to any of my messages! :ptv-pouty:
01-06-2018T15:53:38,MatyMaty,D: sorry!
01-06-2018T15:53:51,MatyMaty,:ptv-whiny:
01-06-2018T15:55:54,SageSaga,no one asked about my Vacation last night
01-06-2018T15:56:34,SageSaga,not even the weird Tom x Sage shippers
01-06-2018T15:56:45,MatyMaty,aww
01-06-2018T15:56:52,MatyMaty,well I am asking now :P

01-06-2018T15:57:27,FoxxTrotter,"Hey, Ord."
01-06-2018T15:57:36,SageSaga,we had a great time- though my legs turned into ticking timebombs from the walking all over the place
01-06-2018T15:57:56,MatyMaty,yikes. But still I'm glad you had fun!
01-06-2018T15:58:42,SageSaga,I got a Rem Keyboard/Mouse pad - and 2 mangas with Rem on the covers- and a Rem Daki
01-06-2018T15:58:57,MatyMaty,I'm starting to think you like Rem
01-06-2018T15:59:03,SageSaga,maaaybeeee
01-06-2018T15:59:05,MatyMaty,XD
01-06-2018T15:59:49,Ordithus,Glad you're feeling better today
01-06-2018T16:00:55,sunblaze,hiya
01-06-2018T16:01:08,FoxxTrotter,"Heya, Sunblaze."
01-06-2018T16:01:13,MatyMaty,"Ah, Sage was feeling bad?"
01-06-2018T16:01:22,MatyMaty,puts on her sexy nurse costume

01-06-2018T16:07:37,sunblaze,I just looked up slingkini. to slingy for me.
01-06-2018T16:08:18,MatyMaty,:ptv-shock:
01-06-2018T16:10:09,MatyMaty,Sage likes slings :v
01-06-2018T16:10:19,SageSaga,i like many things
01-06-2018T16:10:28,sunblaze,perhaps. But I prefer a proper bikini.
01-06-2018T16:10:38,MatyMaty,Can I link the Sarah?
01-06-2018T16:10:43,MatyMaty,"Er, Femphil"

01-06-2018T16:10:58,MatyMaty,https://i.imgur.com/6hVUwvE.png
01-06-2018T16:11:07,MatyMaty,that's a nekokini. Sage's invention :P
01-06-2018T16:11:27,Ordithus,:ptv-ohmy:
01-06-2018T16:11:27,SageSaga,did i invent that?
01-06-2018T16:11:39,MatyMaty,You named it at least XD
01-06-2018T16:13:05,eric190,hi everyone
01-06-2018T16:13:24,SageSaga,yo
01-06-2018T16:13:36,MatyMaty,"btw Sage, have you thought of using a keypad for shortcuts?"
01-06-2018T16:13:45,MatyMaty,I got one a few days ago and it is great
01-06-2018T16:13:56,FoxxTrotter,"Hey, Eric."
01-06-2018T16:14:10,MatyMaty,Hey Eric
01-06-2018T16:14:29,SageSaga,i just use my express keys on the tablet
01-06-2018T16:15:18,SageSaga,its also a touch screen so i can move and rotate without any keys - oh and zoom in and out
01-06-2018T16:15:32,MatyMaty,yes but
01-06-2018T16:15:41,MatyMaty,with a keypad you could do more
01-06-2018T16:16:17,SageSaga,like what? i have 8 buttons already
01-06-2018T16:17:07,MatyMaty,"change the brush size, rotate through tools, undo/redo and so on"
01-06-2018T16:17:13,MatyMaty,check your discord :o
01-06-2018T16:17:41,SageSaga,i can do all that with my express keys
01-06-2018T16:18:37,MatyMaty,:disappointed:
01-06-2018T16:19:11,SageSaga,also ive looked into those before and i couldnt afford any of the good ones
01-06-2018T16:20:38,MatyMaty,"the tartarus is not bad, and it is likr $60 :o"
01-06-2018T16:20:49,MatyMaty,the logitech one is around the same price I think
01-06-2018T16:22:57,MatyMaty,But if you are happy with the way you do thinks that's great. I never use my express keys for some reason
01-06-2018T16:23:45,SageSaga,i dont know why people avoid em - i find em very helpful
01-06-2018T16:24:44,Rosscoe,color comic day!
01-06-2018T16:25:08,Rosscoe,I remembered this time
01-06-2018T16:25:26,FoxxTrotter,"Hey, Rosscoe."
01-06-2018T16:30:41,Bgrmystr2,"Hey guys, been lurking on a non-acct. how's everyone doing?"
01-06-2018T16:30:57,Bgrmystr2,"also, sage, people DID ask you how your trip went and such Fri night during the stream"
01-06-2018T16:31:00,Bgrmystr2,"several times, I watched"
01-06-2018T16:31:01,SageSaga,ok - it's storming outside now
01-06-2018T16:31:13,SageSaga,dont you lie to me
01-06-2018T16:31:18,Bgrmystr2,I'm not.
01-06-2018T16:31:23,Bgrmystr2,I watched phoenix ask for one
01-06-2018T16:31:24,SageSaga,BOY
01-06-2018T16:31:26,Bgrmystr2,and a couple others
01-06-2018T16:31:44,Bgrmystr2,you might have been brb one of the times
01-06-2018T16:31:47,Bgrmystr2,:c
01-06-2018T16:31:52,SageSaga,then they didnt ask me
01-06-2018T16:31:59,SageSaga,they were probably asking Tom!
01-06-2018T16:31:59,Bgrmystr2,&gt;:T that's not how it works
01-06-2018T16:32:11,Bgrmystr2,It sounds like you had fun though
01-06-2018T16:32:26,superwolfart,hi
01-06-2018T16:32:33,Bgrmystr2,GJ on the rem loot :thumbsup::ok_hand:
01-06-2018T16:32:37,FoxxTrotter,"Hey, Superwolf."
01-06-2018T16:32:38,Bgrmystr2,heya super
01-06-2018T16:33:06,SageSaga,we went to a gourmet burger place
01-06-2018T16:33:23,FoxxTrotter,"Yeah, a thunderstorm just passed through here."
01-06-2018T16:33:52,FoxxTrotter,"They are coming from the northwest, so I know that w0lf is sending me his bad weather. ;0P"
01-06-2018T16:36:58,Ordithus,How dare he
01-06-2018T16:37:20,Ordithus,Gourmet burgers?  Sounds delicious
01-06-2018T16:38:05,SageSaga,really good- really expensive
01-06-2018T16:38:14,SageSaga,14 bucks for a burger
01-06-2018T16:38:21,Ordithus,A bit spendy
01-06-2018T16:38:30,SageSaga,4 bucks for some fries
01-06-2018T16:38:37,FoxxTrotter,"Yes, a pit pricey indeed."
01-06-2018T16:38:44,FoxxTrotter,bit*
01-06-2018T16:38:52,Ordithus,Though such prices are pretty common at restaurants around me
01-06-2018T16:38:53,SageSaga,thankfully i didnt have to pay for it
01-06-2018T16:40:28,SageSaga,even still - i got the cheapest stuff
01-06-2018T16:40:42,SageSaga,i was the only one to get a small milkshake instead of a large
01-06-2018T16:41:08,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: wouldn't a milkshake be bad for you though?
01-06-2018T16:41:10,Ordithus,Brave soul
01-06-2018T16:41:24,SageSaga,terrible for me
01-06-2018T16:41:27,SageSaga,but i love it
01-06-2018T16:41:33,Bgrmystr2,dis guy
01-06-2018T16:41:35,Bgrmystr2,living on the edge
01-06-2018T16:44:34,SageSaga,the first hotel was nice except for the bathroom
01-06-2018T16:44:46,SageSaga,you had to step over the toilet to get into the shower...
01-06-2018T16:44:54,MatyMaty,o_o
01-06-2018T16:44:56,sunblaze,that tiny?
01-06-2018T16:45:01,sunblaze,was it at least clean?
01-06-2018T16:45:09,SageSaga,it was clean and very modern looking XD
01-06-2018T16:45:20,sunblaze,well at least something
01-06-2018T16:46:21,SageSaga,then we moved into the Omni and that's a nice place
01-06-2018T16:46:32,SageSaga,we were on the 20th floor
01-06-2018T16:46:47,Ordithus,Nice view from there?
01-06-2018T16:47:04,SageSaga,yep- looking right out onto the Park and the CNN Center
01-06-2018T16:48:23,FoxxTrotter,CNN Center used to be the Krofft Amusement Park. That's hard to believe.
01-06-2018T16:48:37,Ordithus,That's a cool looking hotel!
01-06-2018T16:49:21,SageSaga,it's connected directly to the massive convention center so we didnt have to go into the sun to get there :P
01-06-2018T16:49:51,FoxxTrotter,There used to be an arena called the Omni as well. It eventually got replaced by Phillips Arena.
01-06-2018T16:50:22,sunblaze,"^that helps keeping the skin ""embalming light"""
01-06-2018T16:51:39,Rosscoe,Damnit Sage your making me hungry
01-06-2018T16:52:05,SageSaga,we had a friend meeting us there from Vegas
01-06-2018T16:52:36,SageSaga,"we were like ""Man it's going to be hot"" and he was like ""Pfft- no it's not! It's like 80-85!"""
01-06-2018T16:52:54,SageSaga,"and we were like - ""poor thing, he's about to learn about humidity..."""
01-06-2018T16:53:30,Bgrmystr2,lool
01-06-2018T16:53:40,Bgrmystr2,humidity will destroy you at the same temps
01-06-2018T16:53:46,Bgrmystr2,esp if it's really high
01-06-2018T16:54:04,Ordithus,"Yeah.  I've been to AZ plenty of times, 90 isn't bad when it's dry."
01-06-2018T16:54:06,Bgrmystr2,"also, that hotel looks nice"
01-06-2018T16:54:36,Ordithus,80+ and 100% humidity is ick
01-06-2018T16:54:39,Bgrmystr2,"I like the warmth down here, but hate the humidity. like 90-100F near 90% humidity"
01-06-2018T16:54:48,Ordithus,:ptv-nope:
01-06-2018T16:54:49,Bgrmystr2,basically all summer..
01-06-2018T16:55:04,Bgrmystr2,and then hurricanes come to cool everything down. How nice of them
01-06-2018T16:55:07,Bgrmystr2,:u
01-06-2018T16:55:20,FoxxTrotter,Yep. That season started yesterday.
01-06-2018T16:55:29,Bgrmystr2,not excited
01-06-2018T16:55:45,FoxxTrotter,Although...Alberto did quite a number in western North Carolina.
01-06-2018T16:56:14,FoxxTrotter,I believe I-40 is still closed out there near Ashville due to a landslide.
01-06-2018T16:56:26,Bgrmystr2,:/
01-06-2018T16:57:06,FoxxTrotter,"Yeah, it's a mess out that way at the moment."
01-06-2018T16:57:48,Bgrmystr2,hoping we don't get a repeat of katrina this year
01-06-2018T16:57:53,Bgrmystr2,though I hope that every year.
01-06-2018T16:58:23,FoxxTrotter,"The images from Ellicott City, Maryland was quite terrifying though during their flood the other week with how fast that water was moving through town."
01-06-2018T16:58:32,Bgrmystr2,yeah I saw that
01-06-2018T16:58:45,FoxxTrotter,Second time in two years.
01-06-2018T16:59:38,FoxxTrotter,"Since I've lived here in NC, the worst hurricane I've been through here was Fran back in 1996."
01-06-2018T17:00:20,FoxxTrotter,"Floyd and Matthew compare, but much of that was further to the south or east of me."
01-06-2018T17:02:36,Bgrmystr2,the matthew from the 90s? :o
01-06-2018T17:02:44,FoxxTrotter,"No, two years ago."
01-06-2018T17:02:46,Bgrmystr2,oh
01-06-2018T17:03:21,FoxxTrotter,Floyd was back in 1999.
01-06-2018T17:03:30,Bgrmystr2,"there was a Cat 5 Matthew that was predicted to hit the entire right coast of florida, GA, and etc with the eye wall"
01-06-2018T17:03:38,Bgrmystr2,but I don't think it did
01-06-2018T17:03:57,Bgrmystr2,"I was on the coast of GA at the time, so we evaced :c"
01-06-2018T17:04:39,FoxxTrotter,The Matthew in 2016 was a Category 5.
01-06-2018T17:04:50,Bgrmystr2,"well, the one I recall was in the 1990s"
01-06-2018T17:05:01,Bgrmystr2,cuz that was when I lived in GA before we moved in 2002
01-06-2018T17:08:15,Bgrmystr2,ok it might have been Andrew I recall
01-06-2018T17:08:30,FoxxTrotter,Andrew was in 1992.
01-06-2018T17:09:22,Bgrmystr2,yeah
01-06-2018T17:09:27,Bgrmystr2,I was little
01-06-2018T17:09:37,Bgrmystr2,so I may be confusing the two
01-06-2018T17:09:44,Ordithus,Hmm... is 30 below and 3 foot snow storms a worthy tradeoff for no hurricanes?
01-06-2018T17:09:57,Bgrmystr2,uh.. I dunno
01-06-2018T17:10:28,Bgrmystr2,"Every time I talk with my mother about it, she prefers it down south, even w/ the hurricanes"
01-06-2018T17:10:39,Bgrmystr2,rather than up north in Massechusetts
01-06-2018T17:10:48,FoxxTrotter,"Been there, done that. Blizzard of 1993 in NYS."
01-06-2018T17:10:49,Bgrmystr2,where it was fuckin cold as balls
01-06-2018T17:11:22,FoxxTrotter,They had a wind chill as low as 66 below zero.
01-06-2018T17:11:38,Ordithus,Brr
01-06-2018T17:11:44,Bgrmystr2,do not want
01-06-2018T17:11:45,Bgrmystr2,xD
01-06-2018T17:12:21,FoxxTrotter,"I was already out of New York at the time, but Oswego County got over 120 inches of snow in two weeks during that winter."
01-06-2018T17:12:48,FoxxTrotter,Back in 2007.
01-06-2018T17:13:39,Bgrmystr2,"you can keep yourself warm even during ridiculous colds, though, so that's nice"
01-06-2018T17:13:49,Bgrmystr2,just gotta keep the fire burning
01-06-2018T17:13:50,FoxxTrotter,Mmm-hmm.
01-06-2018T17:13:52,LannAF,Yowdy!
01-06-2018T17:13:56,Ordithus,"Until the heat gives out, and you die :P"
01-06-2018T17:13:57,FoxxTrotter,"Heya, Lann."
01-06-2018T17:14:00,SageSaga,yo Lann
01-06-2018T17:14:07,LannAF,"Heya Fox, heya Sage, hi everyone else"
01-06-2018T17:14:10,Bgrmystr2,can't really keep yourself dry when a hurricane floods your street with 2 stories of water
01-06-2018T17:14:14,Bgrmystr2,heya Lann
01-06-2018T17:15:04,FoxxTrotter,"BRB, need to clean my lunch dishes from earlier."
01-06-2018T17:18:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I have lunch. Nice lil lasagna square
01-06-2018T17:19:52,LannAF,How is everyone?
01-06-2018T17:20:06,Bgrmystr2,tired and exausted from moving stuff :c
01-06-2018T17:20:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve decided to go on a diet of sorts. With 50 squats a day
01-06-2018T17:20:17,Bgrmystr2,"Hm, I should brb as well :c"
01-06-2018T17:20:47,SpazztasticKiwi,My legs hate me
01-06-2018T17:21:52,FoxxTrotter,"Yeah, I went to the zoo last weekend. My legs were sore for a bit after all that walking."
01-06-2018T17:26:10,Ordithus,"I walked tons last weekend.  Golf, hiking, golf, more hiking..."
01-06-2018T17:26:16,Ordithus,It was good :)
01-06-2018T17:28:07,FoxxTrotter,You can keep the golf. :0P
01-06-2018T17:28:14,LannAF,Leg days are great
01-06-2018T17:28:19,LannAF,"Painful, but great"
01-06-2018T17:28:24,SageSaga,not great
01-06-2018T17:28:25,SageSaga,terrible
01-06-2018T17:28:26,LannAF,Exercise I find makes me feel much better :D
01-06-2018T17:28:29,FoxxTrotter,"Hiking, though, I need to get back on sometime."
01-06-2018T17:28:34,LannAF,ooo
01-06-2018T17:28:36,LannAF,I love hiking
01-06-2018T17:29:20,Ordithus,"Hiking &gt; golf, I will admit"
01-06-2018T17:31:41,FoxxTrotter,"The last time I went on an Adirondack hike, though, I broke my wrist. :0( A number of the trails can get muddy up there. It's easy to slip and fall if you're not careful."
01-06-2018T17:32:54,FoxxTrotter,"Trails along the A.T. aren't quite that bad, but you have to watch out for loose rocks in some places."
01-06-2018T17:38:57,LannAF,D:
01-06-2018T17:39:03,LannAF,"Sorry to hear that, that sucks"
01-06-2018T17:39:37,FoxxTrotter,It happens.
01-06-2018T17:41:05,Bgrmystr2,"back, expected sage to be done :P"
01-06-2018T17:41:12,Bgrmystr2,not done
01-06-2018T17:41:34,sunblaze,patience young padawan!
01-06-2018T17:41:45,Bgrmystr2,"that's not patience, you know"
01-06-2018T17:42:03,Bgrmystr2,"I was expecting sage to finish while I was gone, and that I would miss the rest of the stream lol"
01-06-2018T17:42:09,Bgrmystr2,it's different :u
01-06-2018T17:42:25,Bgrmystr2,"but it didn't happen, so that's good"
01-06-2018T17:42:26,sunblaze,"ah so more like luck, cause now you can see more stream"
01-06-2018T17:42:31,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, see"
01-06-2018T17:42:33,Bgrmystr2,:D
01-06-2018T17:42:45,SageSaga,eating some dinner atm
01-06-2018T17:42:50,Bgrmystr2,oooh that explains
01-06-2018T17:42:54,FoxxTrotter,Okie.
01-06-2018T17:49:35,LannAF,Sage
01-06-2018T17:49:39,LannAF,I want to go to Flip burger again
01-06-2018T17:49:43,LannAF,It was SO. FRICKING. GOOD.
01-06-2018T17:49:57,LannAF,and all caps was not very necessary but I saw fit to it anyhow
01-06-2018T17:50:48,SageSaga,i cant afford it- but i do regret not getting the captain crunch milkshake
01-06-2018T17:52:26,LannAF,ugh
01-06-2018T17:52:32,LannAF,Those milkshakes were the best ending to that dinner
01-06-2018T17:56:09,Ordithus,"Going to get some dinner myself.  See ya!  Thanks for the stream, Sage."
01-06-2018T17:56:16,FoxxTrotter,"C-ya, Ord."
01-06-2018T18:02:04,LannAF,cya Ord!
01-06-2018T18:02:30,SageSaga,wings are way too messy to try and draw and eat at the same time
01-06-2018T18:02:47,FoxxTrotter,"Yes, they are."
01-06-2018T18:03:43,BadFoMo,Hmm... The Wings and Drawing Challange...
01-06-2018T18:08:32,SageSaga,?
01-06-2018T18:08:39,SageSaga,ah i get it now-
01-06-2018T18:09:24,SageSaga,"i thought you were saying there was a drawing challenge that involved drawing wings and i was like ""That's almost as hard as eating wings while drawing!"""
01-06-2018T18:10:55,BadFoMo,"I know it's not that harmful to the user, but do you think the internet will go for it?"
01-06-2018T18:11:45,SageSaga,no because its really annoying to clean oil and bbq sauce off of tablets and keyboards-
01-06-2018T18:12:37,Bgrmystr2,back again
01-06-2018T18:12:52,SageSaga,wb again
01-06-2018T18:13:04,Bgrmystr2,today is not my day :/
01-06-2018T18:13:09,Bgrmystr2,and thanks
01-06-2018T18:13:42,Bgrmystr2,"I keep forgetting you do eyes last, so I was wondering what youve been doin, but it's the shading"
01-06-2018T18:13:55,BadFoMo,"That sound like something an intelegent person would say, so it's perfect for the internet!"
01-06-2018T18:14:44,BadFoMo,"...Also, Late responding BadFoMo is late."
01-06-2018T18:15:06,Bgrmystr2,lol the super wing challenge.. eat wings w/ bbq sauce or whatever while drawing wings at the same time..
01-06-2018T18:15:44,Bgrmystr2,"just don't wing the art, cuz winging wings tends to make them look bad :v"
01-06-2018T18:52:24,SageSaga,all done
01-06-2018T18:52:30,FoxxTrotter,NYCE. :0)
