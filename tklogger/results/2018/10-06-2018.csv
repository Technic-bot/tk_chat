10-06-2018T05:55:16,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/S9oQfgi.jpg Bearded Trace has changed just a bit lol.
10-06-2018T05:57:28,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah
10-06-2018T05:57:33,unsteddyphoenix,He has so much
10-06-2018T05:57:44,unsteddyphoenix,Just...unreleased stuff
10-06-2018T05:58:04,unsteddyphoenix,This trace you could voice
10-06-2018T05:58:07,unsteddyphoenix,He has stubble
10-06-2018T05:58:58,Bgrmystr2,wait really? When did the image of that folder come from Dadro?
10-06-2018T06:02:57,unsteddyphoenix,the datters were originally 14 and 17 huh...
10-06-2018T06:09:28,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: Hm, 6:10 in the mornin"
10-06-2018T06:09:32,Bgrmystr2,will need to sleep I guess
10-06-2018T06:09:45,Dadrobit,"Oh, man, it's old, Tom put those out years ago."
10-06-2018T06:09:54,Bgrmystr2,oh okay good to know
10-06-2018T06:09:57,Bgrmystr2,thought it was recent
10-06-2018T06:09:57,Dadrobit,Along with showing off the original first pages
10-06-2018T06:09:59,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/qLowtz7.jpg
10-06-2018T06:10:13,Dadrobit,Fun Note: Flora doesn't have her stripes yet.
10-06-2018T06:10:19,Bgrmystr2,omg ;D
10-06-2018T06:10:24,Bgrmystr2,er
10-06-2018T06:10:26,Bgrmystr2,:D *
10-06-2018T06:10:30,Bgrmystr2,wrongface
10-06-2018T06:11:09,Bgrmystr2,"""Dream 1"" in the bottom of that 2nd comic panel"
10-06-2018T06:11:30,Bgrmystr2,"we don't get to see the ""Level 1 warrior"" I'm kinda sad lol"
10-06-2018T06:11:36,Bgrmystr2,"but alas, to sleep I go"
10-06-2018T06:11:58,Dadrobit,Night!
10-06-2018T06:12:56,Dadrobit,"Also, I'm not sure that I'd want to voice a character tbh."
10-06-2018T06:15:47,Dadrobit,"This comic's got some legs, and that'd be a heckuva task to actually put together a cast that could put in the time to narrate everything to an acceptable degree of quality."
10-06-2018T06:16:53,Dadrobit,Much less animate the whole thing like it's some weekend task.
10-06-2018T06:36:36,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh yeah, theres no chance of that"
10-06-2018T06:36:51,unsteddyphoenix,More talking in some magical dreamworld where an animation was feasible
10-06-2018T06:37:03,unsteddyphoenix,Though wouldnt cast you as trace in all seriousness
10-06-2018T07:23:27,Dadrobit,To speak nothing of the difficulty of representing 3 different languages without actually having anything to work off of except English.
10-06-2018T07:24:23,unsteddyphoenix,There would need to be some sort of workaround
10-06-2018T07:24:25,Dadrobit,That would be hella cumbersome to narrate.
10-06-2018T07:25:27,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah an animaiton is just unrealistic
10-06-2018T07:25:35,unsteddyphoenix,Clearly needs to be a fully fledged film
10-06-2018T07:25:49,unsteddyphoenix,Also do you know what sleep is
10-06-2018T07:26:20,Dadrobit,"If it were just in an audiobook format, it might not be terrible with a narrator. But otherwise..."
10-06-2018T07:26:40,Dadrobit,Sleep is for the weak and the well rested.
10-06-2018T07:26:46,unsteddyphoenix,Hmm. That could be alright.
10-06-2018T07:27:11,unsteddyphoenix,I appreciate you
10-06-2018T07:27:21,unsteddyphoenix,All other americans have left meÂ¬
10-06-2018T07:27:48,unsteddyphoenix,Converting it to an audiobook might not be impossible
10-06-2018T07:27:53,unsteddyphoenix,Lot of work but
10-06-2018T07:28:07,Dadrobit,"Stuff like, ""Flora and Natani whispered to one another in their mother tongue."" *Insert dialogue*"
10-06-2018T07:28:36,Dadrobit,"Awww, thanks for the appreciation."
10-06-2018T07:28:58,Dadrobit,I know one person who's not gonna appreciate this later today though. Me.
10-06-2018T07:29:09,Dadrobit,But he's largely unimportant.
10-06-2018T07:30:47,unsteddyphoenix,Says you
10-06-2018T07:31:11,Dadrobit,"I mean, it'd be totally possible to turn it into an audiobook. It'd be like any other non-book IP being turned into a novel, like the Halo books."
10-06-2018T07:31:31,unsteddyphoenix,How many books are translated from comic to audiobook?
10-06-2018T07:31:43,Dadrobit,Then it's just a matter of casting and engineering it.
10-06-2018T07:31:52,unsteddyphoenix,"It actually seems easier. You can just describe each panel, not much thought needed."
10-06-2018T07:32:19,Dadrobit,That's what I'd assume would be the case.
10-06-2018T07:32:48,Dadrobit,Still a boatload of work though at over 1k pages.
10-06-2018T07:34:09,unsteddyphoenix,"Damn, one page a day would be 3 years..."
10-06-2018T07:34:25,Dadrobit,"Hm, compiling the script wouldn't be terrible now either with page transcripts already done now."
10-06-2018T07:36:00,Dadrobit,"Honestly, with a competent team, depending on how long it took a writer/editor to transcribe the action and scenery going on, it would probably only take a few months."
10-06-2018T07:36:16,Dadrobit,But it would take a grand amount of $$$
10-06-2018T07:36:27,unsteddyphoenix,Unless it was a passion project for all of them
10-06-2018T07:36:35,unsteddyphoenix,Would multiple writers be possible?
10-06-2018T07:36:57,Dadrobit,Passion project turns it into many more months lol.
10-06-2018T07:37:07,unsteddyphoenix,I imagine Tom would have to be consulted sometimes for insight into the characters thoughts...
10-06-2018T07:37:14,unsteddyphoenix,It's true.
10-06-2018T07:37:34,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe a kickstarter lo;
10-06-2018T07:38:47,Dadrobit,I think multiple writers would be ~possible~... But they'd likely end up stumbling over one another. Better to have a proper team of director/writer/editor.
10-06-2018T07:39:18,unsteddyphoenix,True. It's cheaper anyway.
10-06-2018T07:39:55,Dadrobit,A single wirter helps keep the vision consistent.
10-06-2018T07:40:27,unsteddyphoenix,"I agree, the downside is being dependent on that person"
10-06-2018T07:40:37,unsteddyphoenix,But it's better than having the writing style jump around at places
10-06-2018T07:41:28,Dadrobit,The failure of a single person not delivering their share is a burden that every person on the team bears.
10-06-2018T07:42:00,unsteddyphoenix,I know it well...even once been that person.
10-06-2018T07:42:07,unsteddyphoenix,feels bad both ways
10-06-2018T07:42:24,Dadrobit,"A writer not delivering, or a narrator not delivering. Both would put everything on halt."
10-06-2018T07:43:04,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I'm hella bad at procrastinating on non-essential things..."
10-06-2018T07:43:34,Dadrobit,Tom's still waiting on the next draft of the side story from me....
10-06-2018T07:44:15,unsteddyphoenix,lol
10-06-2018T07:44:42,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah I planned to hand in more attempts, or modify the story I already did but..."
10-06-2018T07:44:49,unsteddyphoenix,I didnt!
10-06-2018T07:45:01,unsteddyphoenix,Have so many half-finished projects...
10-06-2018T07:46:03,Dadrobit,That's also why I'm hesitant to support the Sage/Tom graphic novel. How many projects does Tom have already that he wants to do?
10-06-2018T07:46:44,unsteddyphoenix,A lot.
10-06-2018T07:47:21,Dadrobit,Winry. Colin/Sam. Fan side comics.
10-06-2018T07:47:42,unsteddyphoenix,"I think the Wrinry dream might be dead, but yeah."
10-06-2018T07:48:31,unsteddyphoenix,I dont think it's a graphic novel
10-06-2018T07:48:45,unsteddyphoenix,Sage described it as a japanese light novel style
10-06-2018T07:49:04,Dadrobit,"Ah, yeah, that was it."
10-06-2018T07:49:07,unsteddyphoenix,"Those things are mostly text, with like pictures scattered between them"
10-06-2018T07:49:26,unsteddyphoenix,"What confuses me is, Tom hates writing?"
10-06-2018T07:49:54,unsteddyphoenix,"So I assumed that Sage would be doing most of the actual putting it to words, while they both work on concepts"
10-06-2018T07:50:07,unsteddyphoenix,And maybe Tom draws various pics idk
10-06-2018T07:50:51,Dadrobit,I'm reminded of a bad young adult book I read forever ago where two authors co-wrote a story handing the story off to one another chapter to chapter.
10-06-2018T07:50:57,unsteddyphoenix,"Seems like something they'd do in their spare time, which Tom would be using to do his homework anyway~"
10-06-2018T07:51:26,unsteddyphoenix,That sounds...vaguely masturbatory
10-06-2018T07:51:55,Dadrobit,It was brutally clear that their visions didn't match up and it was kind of a weird tug of war.
10-06-2018T07:52:28,unsteddyphoenix,lol
10-06-2018T07:52:36,unsteddyphoenix,"yeah, a single writer really is better"
10-06-2018T07:52:54,Dadrobit,Funny you should say that actually. One of the authors was clearly trying to turn it into a romance while the other just wanted a slice of life iirc.
10-06-2018T07:54:18,unsteddyphoenix,"Theres a game where you write a paragraph of a story, then hand it off to someone else revealing only the last line to them and they continue it"
10-06-2018T07:54:20,Dadrobit,Is Tom used to doing his homework? I thought his specialty was in putting homework off?
10-06-2018T07:54:31,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe they were playing some variation of that
10-06-2018T07:55:01,unsteddyphoenix,Dunno. Sage strikes me as a somewhat demanding life partner
10-06-2018T07:55:09,Dadrobit,Just make the last sentence a total non sequitor.
10-06-2018T07:56:08,Dadrobit,"""So with my heart steeled against the cold, I began to consume my raw chicken."""
10-06-2018T07:56:44,unsteddyphoenix,I feel like that...goes against the spirit of it
10-06-2018T07:56:50,unsteddyphoenix,But sure
10-06-2018T07:57:14,unsteddyphoenix,"""Then his minecraft game crashed"""
10-06-2018T07:57:23,Dadrobit,Just publish it as a modern art piece.
10-06-2018T07:57:43,unsteddyphoenix,If that isnt art then what is
10-06-2018T07:57:48,unsteddyphoenix,Not counting real art
10-06-2018T07:57:49,Dadrobit,"Everyone else ""just doesn't get it."""
10-06-2018T07:58:53,unsteddyphoenix,The emperors new abstraction
10-06-2018T07:59:04,unsteddyphoenix,"If you dont see it, youre uncultured swine"
10-06-2018T07:59:25,Dadrobit,Lol
10-06-2018T08:01:51,Dadrobit,"I really only had ""be a lazy sak and watch E3"" written in for the docket today, but maybe I should be almost productive towards the side comics story today..."
10-06-2018T08:02:03,Dadrobit,Sack*
10-06-2018T08:02:18,unsteddyphoenix,You can do it! I believe in you!
10-06-2018T08:02:49,Dadrobit,Write? Or be a lazy sack?
10-06-2018T08:03:14,unsteddyphoenix,writing
10-06-2018T08:03:23,unsteddyphoenix,"As a fellow millenial, I know you can do the other"
10-06-2018T08:03:32,unsteddyphoenix,no faith neccessary
10-06-2018T08:03:43,Dadrobit,So much in common!
10-06-2018T08:05:06,unsteddyphoenix,similar interests!
10-06-2018T08:07:16,Dadrobit,".... Square Enix starts in 4 hours. If I put the nose to the grindstone, I could probably finish my draft up before then...."
10-06-2018T08:08:03,unsteddyphoenix,"and then, just as the panel starts, you go to sleep!"
10-06-2018T08:08:19,unsteddyphoenix,Establishing dominance over modern game developers
10-06-2018T08:08:55,unsteddyphoenix,christ I might sleep before you
10-06-2018T08:09:12,Dadrobit,"Iirc, the only thing I'm really interested in from them is Kingdom Hearts 3, and Microsoft already debuted that yesterday with a release date."
10-06-2018T08:09:14,unsteddyphoenix,Ive never...left before someone else in this chat what an odd feeling
10-06-2018T08:09:25,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah I was gonna say, what else is there?"
10-06-2018T08:09:38,unsteddyphoenix,They havent mentioned the FF7 remake for a billion years
10-06-2018T08:10:18,Dadrobit,"Lol, you've probably done it back when I was in security. Used to spend all night on here and get home a half hour from now only to get back on and chat for a bit."
10-06-2018T08:11:47,unsteddyphoenix,Oh yeaaah...
10-06-2018T08:11:51,Dadrobit,"Also, I heard from a friend who has a friend who's uncle works in SE that a lot of FF7 had to be scrapped after the announcement and they've only just recently settled into proper develo"
10-06-2018T08:12:01,Dadrobit,development.
10-06-2018T08:12:25,unsteddyphoenix,What you just said sounds like someone making fun of insider leaks
10-06-2018T08:13:16,Dadrobit,Would I do something like that? :)
10-06-2018T08:14:03,unsteddyphoenix,Inconcludable
10-06-2018T08:14:32,unsteddyphoenix,But my friends cousins dog said maybe
10-06-2018T08:14:53,unsteddyphoenix,And he's a golden retriever so im inclined to believe it
10-06-2018T08:14:59,Dadrobit,"Inconcludable, much like the release date of FF7."
10-06-2018T08:15:47,unsteddyphoenix,Man I wanna play that too
10-06-2018T08:15:56,unsteddyphoenix,Only FFs ive really played were 7 and 10
10-06-2018T08:16:00,unsteddyphoenix,And they were hecking good
10-06-2018T08:16:28,Dadrobit,I've played around half of them.
10-06-2018T08:16:40,Dadrobit,Tactics is probably my favorite one though.
10-06-2018T08:17:19,Dadrobit,It had/has the deepest and most mature story of them all in my opinion.
10-06-2018T08:19:15,Dadrobit,"""A man does not eat an omelette without breaking eggs! Blood is the price of progress! It is the ink in which history's pages are writ! Look around you, boy!"""
10-06-2018T08:19:39,Dadrobit,One of my favorite bad guy monologues.
10-06-2018T08:21:04,Dadrobit,"""Justice? I'd die of shame to hear the word from my own lips! Such  lofty ideals cannot rule a people so common. Who has earned you the right to  wield your sword of justice? To be hailed as hero? Is it not I?"""
10-06-2018T08:21:35,Dadrobit,Such fantastically rotten bastards were in that game.
10-06-2018T08:29:18,unsteddyphoenix,I played tactics2
10-06-2018T08:29:21,unsteddyphoenix,That was really good
10-06-2018T08:29:30,unsteddyphoenix,Always wondered why they didnt make more
10-06-2018T08:30:09,unsteddyphoenix,"Dont remember they story standing out to me much, the the gameplay was fun as heck"
10-06-2018T08:31:28,Dadrobit,The one on the 3DS?
10-06-2018T08:33:13,unsteddyphoenix,mmmI think so
10-06-2018T08:33:21,unsteddyphoenix,was eitther 3ds or gba
10-06-2018T08:35:07,Dadrobit,"Ah, yeah. There were two on mobile. One for the GBA, then the second came out for the DS."
10-06-2018T08:35:36,Dadrobit,"They had similar gameplay style to the PlayStation FFT, but the story was waaaaaaaaaaaay different."
10-06-2018T08:35:37,unsteddyphoenix,yeah likely the ds then
10-06-2018T08:36:00,Dadrobit,The original FFT was straight up Game of Thrones.
10-06-2018T08:36:11,Dadrobit,Before Game of Thrones.
10-06-2018T08:36:26,unsteddyphoenix,ooo
10-06-2018T08:36:33,Dadrobit,The story is actually really really brutal.
10-06-2018T08:36:39,unsteddyphoenix,game of thrones was my shit before game of thrones
10-06-2018T08:37:09,unsteddyphoenix,Im into that
10-06-2018T08:37:30,unsteddyphoenix,"""Political fantasy"" might be my favourite genre"
10-06-2018T08:37:40,unsteddyphoenix,if that is a genre
10-06-2018T08:37:45,unsteddyphoenix,And not something I made up just noe
10-06-2018T08:37:53,Dadrobit,Political Fantasy is a perfect descriptor actually.
10-06-2018T08:38:26,Dadrobit,It's all about the corruption that lies in the thrones of the warring nation. And later you learn of the corruption of the church controlling both sides.
10-06-2018T08:38:32,Dadrobit,nations*
10-06-2018T08:39:34,Dadrobit,A huge focus is also on the class divides of the commoners vs the nobles.
10-06-2018T08:40:02,unsteddyphoenix,im all about everything you just said
10-06-2018T08:40:37,unsteddyphoenix,"""multiple power dynamics"" is my safe word"
10-06-2018T08:40:50,Dadrobit,"""No less human than we? Ha! Now there's a beastly thought. You've been less than we from the moment your baseborn father fell upon your mother in whatever gutter saw you sired! You've been chattel since you came into the world drenched in common blood!"""
10-06-2018T08:41:32,Dadrobit,Savage levels over 9000
10-06-2018T08:42:25,Dadrobit,"Seriously, if you can find the time, it's well worth it. The soundtrack is dope as well."
10-06-2018T08:43:05,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe I can emulate it. My old ps2 was stolen many years ago~
10-06-2018T08:43:37,Dadrobit,It had a remaster for PSP in 2007 if you can get that?
10-06-2018T08:43:59,unsteddyphoenix,"Huh, I do actually have an old psp somewhere"
10-06-2018T08:44:08,unsteddyphoenix,That just might work...
10-06-2018T09:30:00,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, dunno if youre still awake, but gnight"
