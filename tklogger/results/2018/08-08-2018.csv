08-08-2018T00:03:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"If it‚Äôs a soft bristled brush or you have good pants on, it‚Äôd make sense you didn‚Äôt feel it"
08-08-2018T00:03:50,Mippy,I had part of my comferter under me
08-08-2018T00:09:19,Mippy,:ptv-sleepy: Night
08-08-2018T00:10:53,Twokinds,:ptv-greetings:
08-08-2018T00:11:36,Bgrmystr2,heya tom
08-08-2018T00:12:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Hey Tom
08-08-2018T00:12:38,SpazztasticKiwi,What up
08-08-2018T00:15:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I just discovered Bagheera likes watermelon üçâ
08-08-2018T00:34:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also I have news about the kid who‚Äôs supposed to be banned and mom that is banned: they are no longer allowed to receive compensation items, just exchanges and refunds if they return with the affected item and receipt"
08-08-2018T00:34:40,SpazztasticKiwi,*effected
08-08-2018T00:36:04,Bgrmystr2,affected*
08-08-2018T00:36:13,Bgrmystr2,had it right the first time
08-08-2018T00:36:35,Bgrmystr2,and what store does compensation items? What is this
08-08-2018T00:46:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"As in, ‚ÄúI found something wrong with this, so I want it and another item free as a replacement ‚Äú"
08-08-2018T00:47:28,SpazztasticKiwi,While we‚Äôll do that sometimes you‚Äôre more likely to just get the thing you found a problem with replaced for free. Another item may accompany it if it‚Äôs the second or more time there‚Äôs been a problem
08-08-2018T00:48:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Of course you may start arousing suspicion if you‚Äôre ‚Äúfinding‚Äù alot of problems
08-08-2018T00:48:19,Bgrmystr2,"wtf, there's one reason why you're losing money"
08-08-2018T00:48:30,Bgrmystr2,you only give a replacement if there's somethin wrong with the item
08-08-2018T00:48:43,Bgrmystr2,and then send that item off to be checked
08-08-2018T00:49:07,Bgrmystr2,and there's no extra. wtf is the store doing just giving away free shit xD
08-08-2018T00:49:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Well it‚Äôs what they‚Äôve been wanting. But we only do things like that if you‚Äôre order is late or wrong because of an employee mistake or something
08-08-2018T00:49:24,Bgrmystr2,"that's literally encouraging people to have ""find problems"" with their items"
08-08-2018T00:49:32,Bgrmystr2,just to rip the store off
08-08-2018T00:50:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you ‚Äúfind a hair‚Äù in your meat you got cut - mind you, we all wear our hair up in hairnets - it will be replaced no questions the first time but they may ask for the original package if it ‚Äúhappens‚Äù again"
08-08-2018T00:52:10,SpazztasticKiwi,This lady used to raise stinks over the phone (since she literally couldn‚Äôt show in person) to the point managers gave in for sake of time and sanity
08-08-2018T00:52:36,SpazztasticKiwi,But now even the head manager says ‚Äúno more; no matter what‚Äù
08-08-2018T01:00:41,unsteddyphoenix,Anyone getting Monster Hunter World? Comes out on PC tomorrow
08-08-2018T01:01:13,unsteddyphoenix,It's so...:dollar::dollar::dollar: but I want it...
08-08-2018T01:01:29,Bgrmystr2,not really interested
08-08-2018T01:02:32,SpazztasticKiwi,That rings a üõé for me but no. Don‚Äôt play many games I can‚Äôt carry around with me
08-08-2018T01:26:18,SpazztasticKiwi,So how‚Äôs it going for you Tom
08-08-2018T02:14:33,Twokinds,tiiiired
08-08-2018T02:14:40,Twokinds,But I've finally almost got this comic done

08-08-2018T02:27:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Well being up at 3 am it‚Äôs expected you‚Äôre tired
08-08-2018T02:27:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Double so if you‚Äôre working
08-08-2018T02:29:17,Twokinds,I've been working on this comic from 7am - now
08-08-2018T02:29:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Just go to bed
08-08-2018T02:29:53,unsteddyphoenix,Holy
08-08-2018T02:30:01,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs called taking a break
08-08-2018T02:30:19,unsteddyphoenix,I assume you had some troubles with it
08-08-2018T02:30:24,unsteddyphoenix,Dialogue?
08-08-2018T02:31:33,Twokinds,Yeah
08-08-2018T02:31:39,Twokinds,But it's finally almost done
08-08-2018T02:32:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Like end credits done?
08-08-2018T02:34:08,unsteddyphoenix,Gonna finish it off tomorrow? Or are you powering through.

08-08-2018T02:37:46,SpazztasticKiwi,üëµ ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been 84 years...‚Äù

08-08-2018T03:14:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm off to üõå
08-08-2018T03:48:11,Twokinds,oh nooo
08-08-2018T03:50:11,unsteddyphoenix,What happened?
08-08-2018T03:50:23,unsteddyphoenix,Just notice the time?
08-08-2018T03:50:32,unsteddyphoenix,I can see why this page would take a while...
08-08-2018T03:50:37,Twokinds,New page is up!
08-08-2018T03:51:16,unsteddyphoenix,Well that'll probably put some debate to rest
08-08-2018T03:51:20,unsteddyphoenix,"For now, at least"
08-08-2018T03:52:17,Twokinds,Let's be honest - probably not.
08-08-2018T03:52:26,Twokinds,Haha
08-08-2018T03:52:49,unsteddyphoenix,"Hey i'll give it like, couple days at least!"
08-08-2018T03:53:18,unsteddyphoenix,..maybe!
08-08-2018T03:53:20,Twokinds,I give it 15 minutes
08-08-2018T03:54:56,Twokinds,But the page is done!
08-08-2018T03:55:01,Twokinds,Next page will nooot take as long
08-08-2018T03:55:01,unsteddyphoenix,Hey mental gymnastics takes time~

08-08-2018T03:55:45,unsteddyphoenix,Dun dunn~
08-08-2018T03:56:48,unsteddyphoenix,"I'll check the reddit thread to see how long the gender debate ""peace"" lasts"
08-08-2018T03:57:38,Dadrobit,Good luck. Stay safe.
08-08-2018T04:04:18,Bgrmystr2,"to be honest, I'm sticking to my guns regardless of PoV :)"
08-08-2018T04:07:40,unsteddyphoenix,So...9 minutes?
08-08-2018T04:08:26,Bgrmystr2,"haha, I don't debate with ppl about it though, so"

08-08-2018T12:55:13,iliar,"Tom, you have little problems with page transcript."
08-08-2018T12:55:30,iliar,I fixed it.
08-08-2018T12:55:36,iliar,https://pastebin.com/B5h4Kh0Q
08-08-2018T13:03:00,Twokinds,Thanks
08-08-2018T13:22:27,iliar,"Can you say, what is the age rating of TwoKinds?"
08-08-2018T13:23:26,Twokinds,I usually tell people 15+
08-08-2018T13:23:47,iliar,Thank you
08-08-2018T13:37:25,TorqueEmUp,Seems fair enough.
08-08-2018T14:05:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Nowadays there should be a maturity rating too
08-08-2018T14:11:30,TorqueEmUp,Ehh that's debatable/
08-08-2018T14:12:22,TorqueEmUp,"So you going to get MHW Tom, or that not your thing?"
08-08-2018T14:14:32,Twokinds,Already have it
08-08-2018T14:14:47,Twokinds,I'll be playing it as soon as I get done with some editing
08-08-2018T14:16:35,Twokinds,Oh!
08-08-2018T14:16:48,Twokinds,"Thank goodness, Patreon has finally added a sort by date feature"
08-08-2018T14:16:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Work on comic. Power nap. Edit stuffs. Video game run.
08-08-2018T14:18:14,Twokinds,Story of my life
08-08-2018T14:20:35,Twokinds,"Eugh, some of the oldest Patreon posts are broken or very low res, due to Patreon's old post system and compressure."
08-08-2018T14:20:42,Twokinds,compression*
08-08-2018T14:20:53,SpazztasticKiwi,You don‚Äôt eat
08-08-2018T14:21:28,SpazztasticKiwi,?
08-08-2018T14:22:17,Twokinds,Eating is for losers!
08-08-2018T14:22:28,Twokinds,I'm on the no food diet now!
08-08-2018T14:22:37,Twokinds,Nothing but coffee!
08-08-2018T14:22:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Aw :ptv-sad:
08-08-2018T14:22:56,SpazztasticKiwi,But what about chocolate
08-08-2018T14:23:00,SpazztasticKiwi,And pizza
08-08-2018T14:23:08,SpazztasticKiwi,And steak ü•©
08-08-2018T14:23:26,SpazztasticKiwi,And mac n cheese
08-08-2018T14:24:49,Twokinds,...
08-08-2018T14:24:54,Twokinds,Man I could go for some pizza right now
08-08-2018T14:25:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Surely there‚Äôs a delivery place nearby
08-08-2018T14:26:02,Twokinds,But that costs moneyyyy
08-08-2018T14:26:58,SpazztasticKiwi,But do you want the pizza or not
08-08-2018T14:27:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause you‚Äôre gonna have to either suck it up or go without
08-08-2018T14:27:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Save a little on a tip and go get it yourself
08-08-2018T14:28:18,TorqueEmUp,Thought you might have had the game already. Good stuff
08-08-2018T14:28:43,TorqueEmUp,I enjoyed it a lot. At least up until the really grindy bits.
08-08-2018T14:45:37,Twokinds,But getting it myself requires going outsideee! Nooo
08-08-2018T14:45:42,SpazztasticKiwi,If it‚Äôs Pizza Hut 9ANY is a promo for online a large 1-topping pizza for $9
08-08-2018T14:46:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Not sure if it‚Äôs expired yet or not
08-08-2018T14:46:04,Twokinds,I don't have any local Pizza Huts
08-08-2018T14:46:29,Twokinds,But I do have a coupon I use regularly at Papa Johns that gets me a large 2-topping for $9
08-08-2018T14:46:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Lil Caesars?
08-08-2018T14:46:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh
08-08-2018T14:46:42,Twokinds,It used to give you a large 2-topping for $7!
08-08-2018T14:46:52,Twokinds,But they upped it a few years ago
08-08-2018T14:47:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Had to compete I guess. Never had Papa John‚Äôs I don‚Äôt believe
08-08-2018T14:47:36,Twokinds,"I know people like to dislike Papa Johns, but I actually do like their pizzas."
08-08-2018T14:47:58,Twokinds,"The only other place is Larosas, but they're SO expensive where I am."
08-08-2018T14:48:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Who
08-08-2018T14:48:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Only pizza I don‚Äôt really like is lil Caesars
08-08-2018T14:48:45,Twokinds,A local chain
08-08-2018T14:50:49,SpazztasticKiwi,That explains it
08-08-2018T14:51:04,SpazztasticKiwi,We don‚Äôt have many fancy places
08-08-2018T14:52:32,SpazztasticKiwi,We‚Äôre supposed to be getting a Chick-fil-A but it‚Äôs gonna be out of place
08-08-2018T14:53:50,TorqueEmUp,Yeah we have two Chick-fil-As here
08-08-2018T14:54:03,TorqueEmUp,One being in the Mall food court
08-08-2018T14:54:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve had Chick-fil-A like twice
08-08-2018T14:54:19,TorqueEmUp,the other being literally acrossed the street from the mall in its own building.
08-08-2018T14:54:40,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt like chicken
08-08-2018T14:55:26,TorqueEmUp,"Love me some chicken, healthier than a cow"
08-08-2018T14:55:53,TorqueEmUp,"as long as it's cooked, if not it's vastly less healthy. lol"
08-08-2018T14:57:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Remember the ‚Äúmedium rare chicken‚Äù trend? Stupidity at its finest
08-08-2018T14:57:33,Twokinds,"Man, ALL four of the next Patreon posts are Natani"
08-08-2018T14:57:59,Twokinds,I'm almost tempted to add in another sketch of another idea just to mix it up XD
08-08-2018T15:02:11,SpazztasticKiwi,At least there‚Äôs no mental gymnastics on who the next character you‚Äôre drawing looks like
08-08-2018T15:02:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"Besides if they‚Äôre all Nat, how you gonna just pull another suggestion"
08-08-2018T15:11:31,Twokinds,I don't understand the question.
08-08-2018T15:11:42,Twokinds,"Hm, I can't decide if these shower ones are too much for Patreon."
08-08-2018T15:11:53,Twokinds,I'll probably have to mark them Patron Only just in case.
08-08-2018T15:16:23,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, better to be safe."
08-08-2018T15:36:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you‚Äôre fretting about only doin Nat sketches for the next three or so post, where‚Äôre you gonna find alternate ones to add variety"
08-08-2018T15:37:11,SpazztasticKiwi,*four
08-08-2018T15:39:33,TorqueEmUp,Should have saved that Fidget sketch Tom. lol
08-08-2018T15:39:57,TorqueEmUp,used that to break up the Natani stuff
08-08-2018T15:42:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Could try another poll but
08-08-2018T15:47:51,Twokinds,"Uh, by just picking on"
08-08-2018T15:54:32,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, less hassle just to pick one. Plus I like seeing your picks."
08-08-2018T16:00:48,TorqueEmUp,"Welp, off to work."
08-08-2018T16:10:03,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. if there's 3 natani picks
08-08-2018T16:10:08,Bgrmystr2,in a row...
08-08-2018T16:10:14,Bgrmystr2,then just post 3 natani in a row
08-08-2018T16:10:18,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
08-08-2018T16:10:38,Bgrmystr2,Tis what the fandom wanted
08-08-2018T16:11:23,SpazztasticKiwi,The Patreon part anyway
08-08-2018T16:12:31,Bgrmystr2,he's posting sketches yes? Not patreon color votes. So It's more than just the patreon part of the fandom
08-08-2018T16:12:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh just never mind
08-08-2018T17:55:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Now we‚Äôre on our way to pizza buffet
08-08-2018T17:55:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Also: Sims 3 or Sims 4?
08-08-2018T17:56:28,Bgrmystr2,Sims 1 imo :u
08-08-2018T18:49:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve had 2 for the longest but I‚Äôve been debating one of the two newer ones because of the extra stuff
08-08-2018T19:47:06,Twokinds,Sims 5
08-08-2018T19:47:44,CrRAR,Sims ‚àû
08-08-2018T19:50:57,Dadrobit,It's kitty's birthday tomorrow. Should probably get something for her.
08-08-2018T19:53:49,CrRAR,:gift:
08-08-2018T19:58:04,CrRAR,That gift box is suspiciously the same exact colors as the one Flora sealed herself in.
08-08-2018T19:58:15,CrRAR,:thinking:
08-08-2018T20:09:24,unsteddyphoenix,Get her a lil' hat with goggles~
08-08-2018T20:18:47,Combak,"Hey Tom, you around?"
08-08-2018T20:39:44,Combak,Seems like a nope.
08-08-2018T20:40:30,Combak,I guess I'll let someone else tell him the transcript of the current page is doesn't identify most of its speakers.
08-08-2018T20:42:00,Bgrmystr2,Fairly sure Tom knows. Iliar posted a script earlier
08-08-2018T20:42:06,Bgrmystr2,but it doesn't look like it's been updated yet
08-08-2018T20:53:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Wasn‚Äôt there rumors that Sims 5 was in the works
08-08-2018T20:54:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, make kitty a cake of canned food. It‚Äôs what I bought to make for Bagheera. Just got to put it together"
08-08-2018T21:04:12,SpazztasticKiwi,All these kitties get presents for their birthday. I wonder if they‚Äôre like ‚Äúmy hooman is being really excitable and giving. not sure if I should be suspicious or know now that I am a god‚Äù
08-08-2018T23:01:53,Bigboi182,Hello
