29-01-2018T01:16:16,Bgrmystr2,xD
29-01-2018T01:16:18,TheBeckoner,What was the old voting system?
29-01-2018T01:16:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,picarto's built in voting system
29-01-2018T01:16:38,Bgrmystr2,though I think Picarto improved the voting system
29-01-2018T01:16:46,RedDeath2018,What is a good idea Tom??!
29-01-2018T01:16:51,Dadrobit,"There is a club out in Ohio that I do work for every other week for $50, but only because I've been wth them for so long and they're consistent income."
29-01-2018T01:16:56,Bgrmystr2,the original one let you see what was already voted on before you voted for it
29-01-2018T01:17:02,Bgrmystr2,so you can see if there was a bias
29-01-2018T01:17:05,Bgrmystr2,and it swayed your vote
29-01-2018T01:17:05,Dadrobit,"Yeahhhhhh, no."
29-01-2018T01:17:06,RedDeath2018,I’m confused
29-01-2018T01:17:09,Bgrmystr2,so it was dumb
29-01-2018T01:17:32,TheBeckoner,Huh I dont think its like that now.
29-01-2018T01:17:49,Twokinds,Interesting...

29-01-2018T01:19:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,it might have been behind the iliar won thing?

29-01-2018T02:46:51,Bgrmystr2,You should watch it.
29-01-2018T02:46:54,Bgrmystr2,and the chat.
29-01-2018T02:46:56,Bgrmystr2,And the video.
29-01-2018T02:47:05,Bgrmystr2,don't forget the chat too
29-01-2018T02:47:16,unsteddyphoenix,Ok
29-01-2018T02:47:19,unsteddyphoenix,Should I also watch the chat?
29-01-2018T02:47:23,Bgrmystr2,Yes.
29-01-2018T02:47:29,unsteddyphoenix,Ok I will do that
29-01-2018T02:47:44,Bgrmystr2,:ok_hand:
29-01-2018T03:05:53,Dadrobit,"Take it bitch. 9 atttempts, but that bastard is dead!"
29-01-2018T03:06:06,TheBeckoner,Congrats my dude
29-01-2018T03:08:59,BadFoMo,I am now remembering the Castle in a Swamp bit from Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
29-01-2018T03:11:38,TheBeckoner,Of course. That makes total sense. And how often is it really JUST three words?
29-01-2018T03:11:42,TheBeckoner,oops
29-01-2018T03:12:37,BadFoMo,Wrong chat?
29-01-2018T03:12:53,Bgrmystr2,Nice job Dadro
29-01-2018T03:13:08,Dadrobit,Thank you!
29-01-2018T03:13:16,TheBeckoner,It seems like just saying three words or however may could easily drag out if they aren't happy with them. So more money makes sense.
29-01-2018T03:13:19,TheBeckoner,crap
29-01-2018T03:13:23,TheBeckoner,Im bad at this
29-01-2018T03:13:28,Dadrobit,Now I just need to kill it another 3-4 times so I can wear it's skin
29-01-2018T03:13:34,TheBeckoner,But yeah wrong chat.
29-01-2018T03:14:17,TheBeckoner,"It's late, my work is done and now im slipping lol. I'll see y'all tomorrow."

29-01-2018T03:15:10,Dadrobit,says as it's already past one in the morning
29-01-2018T03:16:03,BadFoMo,@Dadrobit //Troll Inb4 NPC: You killed them?! We need them alive!
29-01-2018T03:16:53,Dadrobit,"Naw, screw that, they demand its death."
29-01-2018T03:17:19,Dadrobit,You actually ~can't~ capture it alive. One of very few that must die.
29-01-2018T03:19:02,BadFoMo,"...Or NPC: Oh, before you go to kill them, there's this sword that will make quick work of them."
29-01-2018T03:22:10,Dadrobit,"Naw, this is Monster Hunter. I could have probably brought a weapon with better stats geared towards its weakness, but it's still an elder dragon, and it would still hit me like a truck even though I'm wearing awesome armor."

29-01-2018T09:19:14,qwe304,watches the recording DURING school
29-01-2018T09:23:06,Azumachan,^
29-01-2018T10:17:05,qwe304,"When i was browsing the old forum, I found your plans (from 2004) to have twokinds-universe novels, in addition to the manga, did anything ever become of this idea, besides the two chapters you posted there?"
29-01-2018T10:19:07,qwe304,(referencing this: http://twokinds.proboards.com/thread/418/twokinds-book )
29-01-2018T12:21:18,Twokinds,no
29-01-2018T12:21:38,qwe304,:( it was really good
29-01-2018T12:22:21,Azumachan,Thank you for the stream yesterday Tom.
29-01-2018T12:23:18,Twokinds,np
29-01-2018T12:28:32,qwe304,"i wish nora cards were on a first-come basis, it feels like the same few people have had them as long as they've been around"
29-01-2018T12:32:40,Twokinds,"Yeah, I do wish I could make some kind of rolling waitlist system"
29-01-2018T12:32:59,Twokinds,"Unfortunately, Patreon doesn't really support anything like that."
29-01-2018T12:33:08,Dadrobit,That's too bad.
29-01-2018T12:35:43,qwe304,"thats unfortunate, so unless you use some other platform for the cards, you're stuck"
29-01-2018T12:41:24,Twokinds,"If I ever took true commissions, that's how I'd intend to do it."
29-01-2018T12:41:35,Twokinds,Not through Patreon or anything like that. Just one at a time.
29-01-2018T12:43:52,iliar,Sometimes I think I needed take a break and give opportunity to buy a Nora Card to others. But I'm afraid of lost my seat.
29-01-2018T12:44:35,iliar,But I try to choose arts not only with my favorite character.
29-01-2018T13:11:10,qwe304,if only the other holders did the same....
29-01-2018T13:15:23,RedDeath2018,Hey guys
29-01-2018T13:17:46,wolfspartan1,hi
29-01-2018T13:18:31,RedDeath2018,How are u
29-01-2018T13:20:16,wolfspartan1,good how about you?
29-01-2018T13:20:26,RedDeath2018,good
29-01-2018T13:23:13,iliar,@qwe304 Well... Probably you are right. But I think other Nora Card Holders choosing good arts. I dont see big problem with it. For example yesterday's Nora Card with Flora on field looks very good.
29-01-2018T13:23:14,RedDeath2018,This chat got really awkward
29-01-2018T13:23:49,RedDeath2018,Yea last night’s stream was really good
29-01-2018T13:44:43,qwe304,"@iliar the art is always good, it just feels like certian people usually pick similar things every month"
29-01-2018T13:49:18,qwe304,"if i got my hands on a card,  I would get some older sketches, particularly those with plot+lore potential, done"
29-01-2018T14:05:40,iliar,Which for example? Maybe they are in my wishlist too?
29-01-2018T14:18:59,qwe304,i gotta go back and find em
29-01-2018T14:22:30,qwe304,particularly this one https://imgur.com/a/CkfJf
29-01-2018T14:23:33,Azumachan,It's a off cannon idea
29-01-2018T14:23:54,Azumachan,2010 ish

29-01-2018T18:07:28,TheFDdriver,but with more responsibility
29-01-2018T18:08:45,JaydenMozingo,"Question, when you guys notice a message in chat or when Tom gets on for streaming, how do you know WHEN he's on? (i'm on laptop) it gives me notification but with no sound"
29-01-2018T18:09:34,wolfspartan1,i don't get notification for the chat
29-01-2018T18:09:47,JaydenMozingo,is there a way this sight works on the phone or something? Beacause I want to know Exactly when the stream is on
29-01-2018T18:09:48,TheFDdriver,just go to settings
29-01-2018T18:10:01,wolfspartan1,i just keep the webpage on one half of the screen and youtube on the other half
29-01-2018T18:10:12,TheFDdriver,same
29-01-2018T18:10:46,wolfspartan1,i was suprised tom streamed last night

29-01-2018T18:11:07,TheFDdriver,and i missed it
29-01-2018T18:11:15,JaydenMozingo,i figured by the schedule he wouldnt be on
29-01-2018T18:11:32,TheFDdriver,he does that sometimes
29-01-2018T18:11:58,TheFDdriver,but to get the notifications
29-01-2018T18:12:12,JaydenMozingo,"but then I thought, alot of people get off work at 8-9 or so, and what would a person who devoted half their life to art do when he's bored?"
29-01-2018T18:12:25,JaydenMozingo,"draw, stream if they have it."
29-01-2018T18:12:42,TheFDdriver,go to settings and scroll down till notifications
29-01-2018T18:13:24,TheFDdriver,you can do other stuff

29-01-2018T18:22:33,Bgrmystr2,it's not reliable
29-01-2018T18:22:51,Bgrmystr2,"the email from picarto can take over an hour, if it even sends.."
29-01-2018T18:22:56,TheFDdriver,well it works almost instantly for me

29-01-2018T18:59:01,RedDeath2018,And I did botany for a year
29-01-2018T18:59:12,qwe304,rowan is a plant with red berries
29-01-2018T18:59:24,JaydenMozingo,"its not rose, because we already have a rose"
29-01-2018T18:59:35,RedDeath2018,Exactly
29-01-2018T18:59:39,JaydenMozingo,"yeah, probably"
29-01-2018T18:59:50,TheFDdriver,rowan can be change to roman
29-01-2018T19:00:09,TheFDdriver,"but he said ""like the plant"""
29-01-2018T19:00:14,JaydenMozingo,but rosemary is a different name.. that could be one
29-01-2018T19:00:26,RedDeath2018,Hmmmmmm
29-01-2018T19:00:34,TheFDdriver,that sound like a girl's name
29-01-2018T19:00:35,JaydenMozingo,hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhmmmm
29-01-2018T19:01:05,JaydenMozingo,"yeah. i was about to say, he would have killed his parents for giving him that name"
29-01-2018T19:01:23,JaydenMozingo,if I were named pubert I would kill myself
29-01-2018T19:01:33,TheFDdriver,isn't he is an orphan?
29-01-2018T19:01:43,JaydenMozingo,Moe-Lester
29-01-2018T19:01:51,JaydenMozingo,I think
29-01-2018T19:01:59,JaydenMozingo,the point being though
29-01-2018T19:02:55,RedDeath2018,All the red plants are girl names
29-01-2018T19:03:04,wolfspartan1,brb
29-01-2018T19:03:09,RedDeath2018,Just checked right niw
29-01-2018T19:03:14,RedDeath2018,Now*
29-01-2018T19:03:40,TheFDdriver,"like qwe said, ""rowan""?"
29-01-2018T19:03:57,RedDeath2018,Maybe yea
29-01-2018T19:03:59,JaydenMozingo,I bet its Rowan
29-01-2018T19:04:09,RedDeath2018,Are we right Tom
29-01-2018T19:04:24,JaydenMozingo,"If we ask tom though, he will probably say ""thats a secret for the future"""
29-01-2018T19:04:36,RedDeath2018,True
29-01-2018T19:04:42,JaydenMozingo,or make him mad
29-01-2018T19:04:50,RedDeath2018,Mad why
29-01-2018T19:04:54,JaydenMozingo,"its like asking god, whats the meaning to life?"
29-01-2018T19:05:13,RedDeath2018,God clearly say it in the Bible d r
29-01-2018T19:05:17,RedDeath2018,Der*
29-01-2018T19:05:18,JaydenMozingo,A person is supposed to find that out theirself
29-01-2018T19:05:31,JaydenMozingo,lol. point being
29-01-2018T19:05:40,JaydenMozingo,we could ask him though
29-01-2018T19:06:12,JaydenMozingo,I don't think we would get a direct answer though
29-01-2018T19:06:30,wolfspartan1,back
29-01-2018T19:06:37,TheFDdriver,WB
29-01-2018T19:06:42,wolfspartan1,ty
29-01-2018T19:06:59,RedDeath2018,That question must stay a mystery till the secret is ready to reveal itself
29-01-2018T19:07:04,TheFDdriver,Tom would probably say a tip or is classified
29-01-2018T19:07:06,JaydenMozingo,I like how he's kept that mistery name thing going for 15 years though XD
29-01-2018T19:07:09,JaydenMozingo,yeah
29-01-2018T19:07:25,RedDeath2018,How does he do it
29-01-2018T19:07:50,TheFDdriver,"by not always calling him ""Red"""
29-01-2018T19:08:09,JaydenMozingo,How does he get used to the drawing on that tablet is my question. i just can't get used to it. the feeling of paper is what im used to
29-01-2018T19:08:24,JaydenMozingo,even though i draw better on tablet.  just feele weird
29-01-2018T19:08:34,RedDeath2018,He has his ways my friend

29-01-2018T19:44:50,BluePhantom90,heh
29-01-2018T19:45:17,JaydenMozingo,"But with Krita software, I didn't get as far as I would have with Photo shop"

29-01-2018T20:11:46,JaydenMozingo,"The stream or comic, or both?"

29-01-2018T20:13:47,wolfspartan1,i agree
29-01-2018T20:14:31,JaydenMozingo,especially because I'm a furry. but some people aren't and they still love this comic. Twokinds is a highly likabe comic furry or not
29-01-2018T20:14:46,JaydenMozingo,*likeable

29-01-2018T20:17:07,wolfspartan1,i might try to draw again one day
29-01-2018T20:17:39,JaydenMozingo,"again, one day? why did you stop?"
29-01-2018T20:18:08,JaydenMozingo,If you don't want to answer you don't have to by the way
29-01-2018T20:18:10,wolfspartan1,it's a dumb reason
29-01-2018T20:18:37,JaydenMozingo,I'm not the guy who judges or says 'tell me now or I will eat you'
29-01-2018T20:20:12,JaydenMozingo,lol
29-01-2018T20:20:19,JaydenMozingo,It's cool though
29-01-2018T20:20:28,JaydenMozingo,Art is an amazing thing
29-01-2018T20:20:31,IDONTWANTYOURSASS,When I found out Twokinds was made by Tom Fischbach mind=blown
29-01-2018T20:20:37,wolfspartan1,well my friend from high school liked tails from sonic so i spend two days drawing and coloring the best tails i could  and the day after i gave it to her i found it on the floor with cat pee on it
29-01-2018T20:21:02,JaydenMozingo,Oh shite
29-01-2018T20:21:14,wolfspartan1,"at that moment i was like ""alright f%%% it"""
29-01-2018T20:21:19,wolfspartan1,lol
29-01-2018T20:21:42,JaydenMozingo,"Well not to be mean, but they don't seem like a 'friend' if you ask me"
29-01-2018T20:22:00,JaydenMozingo,For that reason alone though
29-01-2018T20:22:04,wolfspartan1,oh they arnt my friend any more
29-01-2018T20:22:16,wolfspartan1,haven't been for 3 years
29-01-2018T20:22:45,wolfspartan1,i say they because she had a twin sister
29-01-2018T20:23:08,JaydenMozingo,"But don't give up on Drawing Because one person. Last time someone insulted my art i said ""EAT MY ASS"""
29-01-2018T20:23:16,JaydenMozingo,And continued
29-01-2018T20:23:46,JaydenMozingo,"But man, I say Start drawing again. Don't let someone else bring you down"
29-01-2018T20:24:29,JaydenMozingo,"I bet when Tom was younger and he drew, I bet at some point someone tried to bring him down."
29-01-2018T20:24:42,JaydenMozingo,Now look at him
29-01-2018T20:24:44,wolfspartan1,i think i'm gonna get back into it i want to draw my oc from video games lol

29-01-2018T20:26:58,wolfspartan1,i guess it was a little dumb too
29-01-2018T20:27:03,JaydenMozingo,"If I were you, and I saw the picture like that, I would say ""wow, they're a D-bag. oh well, I'm gonna continue"""
29-01-2018T20:27:29,wolfspartan1,oh trust me i said something to her lol
29-01-2018T20:27:41,JaydenMozingo,Keep going at it man =D

29-01-2018T20:31:56,JaydenMozingo,It's possible
29-01-2018T20:31:59,Bgrmystr2,"the word ""surprise"" implies we don't know."
29-01-2018T20:32:00,RedDeath2018,I don’t know
29-01-2018T20:32:16,Bgrmystr2,otherwise it's not a surprise stream
29-01-2018T20:32:19,JaydenMozingo,He might
29-01-2018T20:32:35,RedDeath2018,Ok
29-01-2018T20:32:56,Bgrmystr2,"he might stream, but as of now it'd be a surprise cuz he hasn't said anything about it."
29-01-2018T20:33:03,JaydenMozingo,"If a guy has nothing to do after work, he might draw.(depending on the person)"
29-01-2018T20:33:16,JaydenMozingo,Like lastnight
29-01-2018T20:33:19,Bgrmystr2,"Jay, tom draws as a living lol"

29-01-2018T20:33:31,RedDeath2018,Drawing is his work
29-01-2018T20:33:47,JaydenMozingo,"Still, I bet He might still have a outside job"
29-01-2018T20:33:52,JaydenMozingo,Idk what
29-01-2018T20:33:53,Bgrmystr2,he doesn't.
29-01-2018T20:34:00,JaydenMozingo,But still
29-01-2018T20:34:06,Bgrmystr2,"there is no still, we know."
29-01-2018T20:34:17,JaydenMozingo,How?
29-01-2018T20:34:51,Bgrmystr2,Because it's a relatively rare subject that's still talked about
29-01-2018T20:35:02,Bgrmystr2,"also, do you not realize that professional artists do art full-time?"
29-01-2018T20:35:20,RedDeath2018,I wish that was my job
29-01-2018T20:35:23,JaydenMozingo,hmm... Thats enough proof for me =D
29-01-2018T20:35:26,JaydenMozingo,lol
29-01-2018T20:35:37,Bgrmystr2,Tom's been a full time artist for a long time
29-01-2018T20:35:43,JaydenMozingo,same. but I have a plan for flight
29-01-2018T20:36:06,JaydenMozingo,Imma be a pilot soon
29-01-2018T20:36:11,JaydenMozingo,someday...
29-01-2018T20:36:19,Bgrmystr2,he gets paid from patreon and he gets paid by keenspot
29-01-2018T20:36:49,RedDeath2018,And Deviant art I thought
29-01-2018T20:36:58,Bgrmystr2,I don't think DA pays people
29-01-2018T20:37:05,RedDeath2018,Oh
29-01-2018T20:37:09,JaydenMozingo,And here I think
29-01-2018T20:37:10,Bgrmystr2,it's just a public site to host art
29-01-2018T20:37:45,Bgrmystr2,"Keenspot is a business, and from what I recall, they pay artists that post their comics on their site"
29-01-2018T20:37:52,Bgrmystr2,cuz that gives them clicks from ads and etc
29-01-2018T20:38:06,JaydenMozingo,Yeah
29-01-2018T20:38:06,RedDeath2018,Oh i see now
29-01-2018T20:38:40,JaydenMozingo,"Man, now I just want to be a flying artist. eh? eh? I should die"
29-01-2018T20:38:44,JaydenMozingo,lol jk
29-01-2018T20:38:46,Bgrmystr2,"Picarto isn't really the same. They don't pay anyone. People can subscribe to the artist and pay for the benefits of that, but"
29-01-2018T20:38:56,Bgrmystr2,the site itself doesn't pay anyone
29-01-2018T20:39:01,RedDeath2018,ok
29-01-2018T20:39:45,RedDeath2018,See if I had the tools I would do drawing cause I love drawing more than piano and computers
29-01-2018T20:39:49,JaydenMozingo,don't you get paid after getting so many subs on youtube too?
29-01-2018T20:40:01,Bgrmystr2,"very little, Jay"
29-01-2018T20:40:08,JaydenMozingo,Hmm
29-01-2018T20:40:12,JaydenMozingo,well tits
29-01-2018T20:40:17,RedDeath2018,Yeah I think that’s how it is works plus with ads
29-01-2018T20:40:18,wolfspartan1,youtube sucks
29-01-2018T20:40:36,RedDeath2018,Well that came out of no where
29-01-2018T20:40:39,JaydenMozingo,That makes me wonder how much he gets paid just from those two things
29-01-2018T20:40:43,Bgrmystr2,"you have to really have a fuckton of subs on youtube, but it's not just subs, it's video watch count and time watched"
29-01-2018T20:41:14,JaydenMozingo,I use Random and weird things in vain
29-01-2018T20:41:33,RedDeath2018,Doesn’t everyone
29-01-2018T20:41:37,JaydenMozingo,"Like, holy nipples,"
29-01-2018T20:41:47,Bgrmystr2,"Tom's brother Mark, for example, does youtube for a living. He's got the subs, views, and watch time to be able to live off it."
29-01-2018T20:42:02,Bgrmystr2,brb door :u
29-01-2018T20:42:07,JaydenMozingo,"Holy tits, Holy shite novels"

29-01-2018T20:43:19,RedDeath2018,Cool thing is that I watch Mark and Tom
29-01-2018T20:43:50,RedDeath2018,They are both entertaining
29-01-2018T20:44:27,RedDeath2018,But Tom gave me motivation to draw
29-01-2018T20:44:48,RedDeath2018,And mark let me watch games I don’t have
29-01-2018T20:45:07,JaydenMozingo,same. To draw furries and things though
