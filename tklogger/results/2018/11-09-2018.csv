11-09-2018T00:09:29,SpazztasticKiwi,By now they’re likely gone

11-09-2018T00:12:58,unsteddyphoenix,I can still congratulate the fact they existed
11-09-2018T00:41:29,Twokinds,"No, you can't"
11-09-2018T00:42:18,Twokinds,I ate the pancakes so thoroughly that they never even existed.
11-09-2018T00:42:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Isn’t that what you do with all food
11-09-2018T00:43:20,unsteddyphoenix,I wasnt emotionally prepared for that dark truth
11-09-2018T00:43:34,unsteddyphoenix,No pancakes were had :ctwokinds-LauraCry:
11-09-2018T00:43:35,Twokinds,That's why I'm always hungry.
11-09-2018T00:43:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe you need a 24/7 cook
11-09-2018T00:44:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Constant plates of courses ready when hunger strikes
11-09-2018T00:44:28,unsteddyphoenix,His 24/7 cook has never existed.

11-09-2018T12:40:02,TorqueEmUp,For me it is at least.
11-09-2018T12:40:23,TorqueEmUp,was almost 1pm before I dragged my ass out of bed.
11-09-2018T12:40:38,CrimsonQuill,I had a day like that.
11-09-2018T12:42:45,TorqueEmUp,"It's only going to get worse for me as it gets into the colder months, then my Seasonal Affective Disorder starts kicking in."
11-09-2018T12:43:30,CrimsonQuill,I had a night where I couldn't sleep for a while. I woke up at 1:25pm the next afternoon.

11-09-2018T15:55:57,CrimsonQuill,I often get that.
11-09-2018T15:56:09,CrimsonQuill,Can't get into a comfy position for hours on end.

11-09-2018T22:12:40,Combak,Sure
11-09-2018T22:13:09,ElvenHunter84,"It's going to sound a bit fucked up, but I like dark, emotional sketches"
11-09-2018T22:13:30,ElvenHunter84,Clovis forces Natani to choose between Zen and Keith. She has to kill one to save the other
11-09-2018T22:14:07,Combak,That will not get votes.
11-09-2018T22:14:29,ElvenHunter84,I suspected as much
11-09-2018T22:14:31,Combak,There's a tiny chance of a Tom pick?
11-09-2018T22:14:57,Combak,"I mean, you are killing a very popular character, either way."
11-09-2018T22:15:18,Combak,"Plus, how would Tom show that?"
11-09-2018T22:15:19,Bgrmystr2,how would you expect clovis to even get the chance to have that kind of situation?
11-09-2018T22:15:49,Combak,"... Seriously now, how often does the ""How"" part of these suggestions matter?"
11-09-2018T22:16:30,Combak,"... How it happened, not how would it be illustrated. XD"
11-09-2018T22:16:45,BadFoMo,25% - 50% of the time?
11-09-2018T22:17:08,Bgrmystr2,"fairly often actually, combak"
11-09-2018T22:17:24,Bgrmystr2,"cuz most of the time, the 'how would this come about' can generally be guessed at"
11-09-2018T22:17:50,Bgrmystr2,or explained in some way that would make sense
11-09-2018T22:18:54,ElvenHunter84,Failed attempt to assassinate Clovis maybe
11-09-2018T22:18:57,Dadrobit,"Yeaaaah. No, that suggestion isn't happening lol"
11-09-2018T22:19:04,Dadrobit,The first one.
11-09-2018T22:19:13,Dadrobit,A failed Clovis assassination probably would.
11-09-2018T22:19:53,Combak,"I think a failed attempt was the ""how"" part."
11-09-2018T22:20:04,Combak,Not a second suggestion.
11-09-2018T22:20:06,Dadrobit,Ah
11-09-2018T22:20:43,Bgrmystr2,"that's.. not how ""how"" works but okay lol"
11-09-2018T22:21:05,Dadrobit,"I could see it though. Something like Zen and Nat sending him a box of chocolates ""Chocolate kills dogs right?"" Clovis just enjoys the chocolate."
11-09-2018T22:21:33,Combak,"""How did they get in that situation? A failed Clovis assassination attempt."""

11-09-2018T22:22:41,Bgrmystr2,"just proving my point, combak xD"
11-09-2018T22:22:50,ElvenHunter84,"Yeah, I was saying that if context is needed, they could have tried to kill him, his guards knock them out and then he punishes them with a Saw-like choice"
11-09-2018T22:22:58,BadFoMo,Must... steal... request...!
11-09-2018T22:23:11,Dadrobit,Not happening Elven
11-09-2018T22:23:31,Bgrmystr2,"see, that's a 'how'"
11-09-2018T22:29:28,unsteddyphoenix,With a saw-like contraption?
11-09-2018T22:29:47,unsteddyphoenix,Just a normal choice is kinda boring
11-09-2018T22:30:15,unsteddyphoenix,Sgotta be dark AND interesting
11-09-2018T22:32:10,ElvenHunter84,Would chained up in a dark room be Saw-like enough?
11-09-2018T22:33:17,unsteddyphoenix,Like that scene from scary movie?
11-09-2018T22:33:58,ElvenHunter84,More like Until Dawn
11-09-2018T22:38:09,unsteddyphoenix,Hmm I don't remember that in there
11-09-2018T22:45:15,ElvenHunter84,There's a part where 2 characters are chained to a wall and the girlfriend (I think) of one of those characters has to choose to kill one to save the other
11-09-2018T22:45:35,ElvenHunter84,Spoiler Alert: But no matter what you pick it saves the boyfriend
11-09-2018T23:09:00,unsteddyphoenix,Oh yeaaah that's fairly early on
11-09-2018T23:17:52,ElvenHunter84,"I'm gonna suggest it and see what happens. I expect 6 votes or less, so if it gets more than that I'll be pleasantly surprised"

11-09-2018T23:56:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera is showing the minimum amount of visible tolerance for the kitten and making sure I see he’s still not happy about it
