27-11-2018T14:34:05,Mippy,Going to try to hunt down some LOL dolls for my sister for Christmas :ctwokinds-keifacepalm: Those ugly things are always sold out
27-11-2018T14:36:21,TerraTheWizard,had to google that
27-11-2018T14:37:03,TerraTheWizard,so is it one of those blind bag things
27-11-2018T14:37:19,TerraTheWizard,but somehow expensive
27-11-2018T14:47:43,Mippy,Yup! But like most five year old NA girls it’s all LOL and slime right now.
27-11-2018T14:48:18,Mippy,"So, since I’ll do anything for that kid, I’m gonna pay the $10"
27-11-2018T14:49:05,TerraTheWizard,"oh right, i forgot slime got popular again"
27-11-2018T14:50:14,Mippy,$10 CAD = roughly £5 according to the conversion I found
27-11-2018T14:52:00,Mippy,"Yup, slime is back. It goes in cycles....next they will be yo yo or bottle caps or something"
27-11-2018T14:55:52,TerraTheWizard,yu gi oh cards
27-11-2018T14:58:31,Mippy,Oh gosh! I missed being part of that age group by a hair
27-11-2018T14:59:48,Mippy,I was in middle school when that was popular. I don’t know what the British equivalent of middle school is.
27-11-2018T15:04:40,CrimsonQuill,Secondary School
27-11-2018T15:11:00,Dadrobit,Wewlad. I saw $10 CAD and thought you were buying some AutoCAD program for $10. Was very very confused.
27-11-2018T15:11:32,TerraTheWizard,lol
27-11-2018T15:12:00,Dadrobit,"Like, that nonsense is at least $100 for the actual AutoCAD program."
27-11-2018T15:12:08,Dadrobit,$100 per month*
27-11-2018T15:13:03,Dadrobit,(Yes I am aware there are free and inexpensive alternatives. Was just saying that's what came to mind)
27-11-2018T15:13:41,Twokinds,lol
27-11-2018T15:14:01,Twokinds,"Yeah CAD software is expensive, I've heard."
27-11-2018T15:14:21,Twokinds,I've only ever used it in High school. And that was OOOLD software.
27-11-2018T15:15:08,Dadrobit,Just did a price check: Per month with no subscription deal is $195 per month. Best subscription deal you can get is a 3 year agreement down to $118 a month.
27-11-2018T15:16:54,Dadrobit,"Pops teaches welding and metalworking at high school and college, so he gets to teach (read: play) with it all nice and paid for through the city pocketbook."
27-11-2018T15:18:04,Dadrobit,"I can kinda work my way through the program, but just barely. Don't really have a need for it."
27-11-2018T15:20:33,Twokinds,Man Whole Foods prices are rediculous!
27-11-2018T15:21:33,Dadrobit,Is that one of those Fresh Organic Only marketed stores?
27-11-2018T15:24:09,Twokinds,Yeah
27-11-2018T15:24:21,CrimsonQuill,I have to use Autocad and Civil 3d for Surveying worl in my course. I can't use it very well.
27-11-2018T15:24:25,CrimsonQuill,woek
27-11-2018T15:24:28,CrimsonQuill,work
27-11-2018T15:24:32,Twokinds,"Amazon's promoting it with discounts, but it's like... everything is 3 times as expensive."
27-11-2018T15:24:47,CrimsonQuill,I don't know what whole foods is.
27-11-2018T15:24:51,Twokinds,Who pays more than 1 dollar an ounce for canned chicken?
27-11-2018T15:24:56,CrimsonQuill,Not me.
27-11-2018T15:25:07,CrimsonQuill,I pay 5 euro for a packet of chicken thighs instead.
27-11-2018T15:25:21,CrimsonQuill,Or 8 euro for two pounds of cubed beef for curry.
27-11-2018T15:25:44,CrimsonQuill,Are they really charging that much for that Tom?
27-11-2018T15:26:02,Dadrobit,Canned.... Chicken?
27-11-2018T15:27:17,Dadrobit,Just a chicken that's been canned?
27-11-2018T15:27:31,CrimsonQuill,I don't know
27-11-2018T15:28:16,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/in0RHbf.jpg
27-11-2018T15:28:35,CrimsonQuill,DEAR GOD NO.
27-11-2018T15:29:48,Dadrobit,Hey Alexa! How does one delete a concept from the universe?
27-11-2018T15:30:15,CrimsonQuill,Hey Cortana-Please use your Halo Ring to destroy canned chicken
27-11-2018T15:31:08,Twokinds,lol
27-11-2018T15:31:15,Twokinds,Not like that
27-11-2018T15:31:21,Twokinds,"It's like... you know, canned tuna"
27-11-2018T15:31:26,CrimsonQuill,Ahhh.
27-11-2018T15:31:29,CrimsonQuill,I see.
27-11-2018T15:31:32,Twokinds,But with chicken instead.
27-11-2018T15:31:36,Dadrobit,"Huh, okay."
27-11-2018T15:31:40,CrimsonQuill,That's a BIT better than a whole tinned chicken...
27-11-2018T15:31:43,Dadrobit,Thank goodness.
27-11-2018T15:31:57,CrimsonQuill,but i still preferr to buy it from the meat counter or butcher's.
27-11-2018T15:32:44,Twokinds,I just like it because it keeps a lot longer than the packaged sliced chicken and turkey and other deli meats.
27-11-2018T15:33:12,Twokinds,I don't go shopping very often so something with a long shelf life is nice.
27-11-2018T15:33:20,CrimsonQuill,I shop at least once a week.
27-11-2018T15:33:26,Dadrobit,I imagine it must be rather salty?
27-11-2018T15:33:33,CrimsonQuill,Porridge is my saviour
27-11-2018T15:33:42,Twokinds,Yeah
27-11-2018T15:33:46,Dadrobit,Weekly to bi-weekly for myself.
27-11-2018T15:33:48,Twokinds,Like any other canned food
27-11-2018T15:33:51,CrimsonQuill,Porridge
27-11-2018T15:34:06,CrimsonQuill,One euro for a kilogram of porridge. it lasts me a month.
27-11-2018T15:34:16,CrimsonQuill,It is very good value
27-11-2018T15:35:06,Dadrobit,"Rice, beans, ramen for a treat. That was my life when I was operating a till for Albertsons."
27-11-2018T15:35:34,CrimsonQuill,Curry or bolognese. Very occasionally a shepherd's pie.
27-11-2018T15:35:40,Twokinds,I had a very strange dream last night. I dream about the most mundain things.
27-11-2018T15:35:44,Twokinds,I was waiting in a line.
27-11-2018T15:35:49,CrimsonQuill,Queing
27-11-2018T15:36:01,CrimsonQuill,Queuing?
27-11-2018T15:37:27,Dadrobit,"No dreaming last night, but the night before I had a dream where I was just suuuuper anxious for a deadline for something that I knew nothing about. Just that I wasn't ready for it."
27-11-2018T15:37:52,Dadrobit,Was not very rested the next day unsurprisingly.
27-11-2018T15:37:56,Twokinds,Waiting outside the cafateria for the previous class to get out. Which is a memory I haven't thought about in a loong time.
27-11-2018T15:38:08,CrimsonQuill,Wierd.
27-11-2018T15:38:29,Twokinds,"Also, that's the best. Being anxious about something in a dream and then realizing there's nothing to worry about."
27-11-2018T15:38:45,CrimsonQuill,"Yeah, that's nice."
27-11-2018T15:38:50,Dadrobit,Suppressed memories of cafeteria food there lol.
27-11-2018T15:39:15,Twokinds,"Mmm, square pizza."
27-11-2018T15:39:26,Twokinds,Tasted like no other pizza.
27-11-2018T15:39:39,CrimsonQuill,We had a stone baked pizza at the weekend
27-11-2018T15:39:44,CrimsonQuill,A margolotta
27-11-2018T15:39:52,Dadrobit,I think it was just because I've been super anxious and on edge ever since my laptop went out. Not being able to do work has been making me a bit twitchy.
27-11-2018T15:39:54,CrimsonQuill,it was a great pizza restaurant.
27-11-2018T15:42:50,Twokinds,I know that feel!
27-11-2018T15:43:02,Twokinds,Back when my tablet broke.
27-11-2018T15:43:16,CrimsonQuill,"Huh, I have the opposite problem."
27-11-2018T15:43:28,CrimsonQuill,I never focus on one thing long enough to do it well.
27-11-2018T15:43:54,CrimsonQuill,"As in, if I have work on my laptop, I keep skipping between work and games and browsing."
27-11-2018T15:44:05,CrimsonQuill,I just can't bring myself to stay still.
27-11-2018T15:45:18,Dadrobit,Ended up installing some glass showers with a buddy of mine's company yesterday just so I'd be doing something productive.
27-11-2018T15:45:43,CrimsonQuill,I know the mood.
27-11-2018T15:47:46,Dadrobit,My back is feeling it a bit though lol. One of the pieces was a 250lb 5 foot by 7 foot behemoth of a pane of glass. Maneuvering that carefully was an absolute pain in the ass.
27-11-2018T15:48:56,CrimsonQuill,"When I was fencing with my Aunt, I had to drag some very large tree branches down the road into a pile for burning. It was hard on the spine."
27-11-2018T15:50:11,Dadrobit,"The kicker: My buddy insisted on being the one to do the lifting into it's final spot, and he ended up kinking an edge and knocking off a shard of it, so the whole thing had to be trashed."
27-11-2018T15:50:37,CrimsonQuill,Ohhh...that must've stung.
27-11-2018T15:51:13,Dadrobit,"Yep, the client was very understanding, just means the install is going to be done at a loss now."
27-11-2018T15:51:27,CrimsonQuill,Wheesh.
27-11-2018T15:51:39,Dadrobit,And it was after a good 3 hours of work cutting the tile and fitting everything.
27-11-2018T15:52:16,CrimsonQuill,"Wow. I've never tiled a bathroom, but I have done work like that where things have gone very wrong."
27-11-2018T15:52:39,CrimsonQuill,"Oh-kay, I'm going to head off now. I'm going to take an early night."
27-11-2018T15:52:41,Dadrobit,Now he's just hoping the next pane he orders is cut EXACTLY the same or else it's going to be a super bad headache for him to try and retro-fit everything.
27-11-2018T15:52:58,Dadrobit,o/ Quill. Have a good one.
27-11-2018T15:53:18,CrimsonQuill,Goodnight Tm! Goodnight Dadrobit! :ptv-victory::ptv-greetings::ptv-victory:

27-11-2018T16:19:14,Dadrobit,"After the last week, I'm thinking the kiddos' Christmas gifts are going to largely be coming from the dollar store..."
27-11-2018T16:20:14,Dadrobit,"Just not in the position to fund the usual ""Best Uncle Ever"" gifts this year for a dozen-ish kids this time around."
27-11-2018T16:25:35,Mippy,"Yeah, I’ve got three extra people to buy for this year...so I’m a bit tight myself"
27-11-2018T16:25:59,Twokinds,I'm not buying anything for anyone this year!

27-11-2018T21:21:05,Vatruvius,"Thanks to Tom's most recent sketch, I have another webcomic that I have since binge read."
27-11-2018T21:23:12,CrRAR,"oh yes, quite actiony."
27-11-2018T21:23:24,CrRAR,plus lots of spooky creatures.
27-11-2018T21:23:45,Vatruvius,"Yeah, the story is pretty good too. Been awhile since I came across something that I just didn't want to stop reading."
27-11-2018T21:23:53,Vatruvius,"And now I am all caught up, the worst part."
27-11-2018T21:45:01,CrRAR,"Yeah it gets you right into it, having seen so little of the world and already the variety of the beasts, it already feels many pages longer than it actually is so far. lol"
27-11-2018T21:49:33,Vatruvius,"Yeah, and now I want more. I think a page dumb of another 50 pages may hold me back for another couples days. Get on it John!"
