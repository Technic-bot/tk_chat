18-06-2018T00:01:16,unsteddyphoenix,Youre right! They kick down the door then immediately turn into a chicken when the spell activates
18-06-2018T00:01:23,unsteddyphoenix,Noone can object! It's foolproof!
18-06-2018T00:04:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"“If anyone objects to this marriage, please keep it to yourself because there is at least two assassins in attendance and I don’t want to clean up the mess”"
18-06-2018T00:05:58,unsteddyphoenix,Who could marry them...
18-06-2018T00:07:31,unsteddyphoenix,"Would Flora want a human marriage? She is pretty ""into"" humans"
18-06-2018T00:08:48,FenceEqualizer,Would she really object either way. No way the meaning would be lose on her
18-06-2018T00:09:15,FenceEqualizer,"She was ready to lose it when Trace said ""our Manor"""
18-06-2018T00:09:25,Twokinds,Flora's never actually been to a wedding. She wouldn't know how it goes.
18-06-2018T00:09:51,unsteddyphoenix,She hasnt watched one in the distance or something?
18-06-2018T00:09:54,FenceEqualizer,Time to learn
18-06-2018T00:10:00,Twokinds,"She's heard stories about it, so she's pretty much an expert."
18-06-2018T00:10:09,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
18-06-2018T00:10:36,FenceEqualizer,Fairytale wedding coming up
18-06-2018T00:10:39,unsteddyphoenix,Kat's read lots of books on it so she could probably put everything together
18-06-2018T00:10:42,Twokinds,lol
18-06-2018T00:11:58,SpazztasticKiwi,And design the dress
18-06-2018T00:12:00,FenceEqualizer,Kat could make the wedding dress and Eric could draw the wedding portrait.  To Floras horror of course
18-06-2018T00:12:16,SpazztasticKiwi,“Now lift the tail.”
18-06-2018T00:12:19,SpazztasticKiwi,“What?”
18-06-2018T00:12:32,SpazztasticKiwi,“The veil. Lift the veil”
18-06-2018T00:12:40,SpazztasticKiwi,“Sure”
18-06-2018T00:12:41,iliar,"I heard stories how to draw, so I pretty much an artist. Although I did not draw anything."

18-06-2018T00:13:03,unsteddyphoenix,Lol spazz
18-06-2018T00:13:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I am 100% sure he’s pull something like that
18-06-2018T00:13:40,iliar,@FenceEqualizer You know that there is already an art with Flora in the wedding dress?
18-06-2018T00:13:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Drooling for a garter removal scene
18-06-2018T00:14:03,SpazztasticKiwi,*he’d
18-06-2018T00:14:14,FenceEqualizer,Sounds about right
18-06-2018T00:15:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Eric will be the founder of TK’s Playboy
18-06-2018T00:16:00,FenceEqualizer,Now my question is will Rose take this well wonder if she'll think of it as a betrayal to her best friend.
18-06-2018T00:16:20,FenceEqualizer,Eric's playboy manor.
18-06-2018T00:16:42,SpazztasticKiwi,And Kat fuming in the background
18-06-2018T00:16:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Literal sparkes coming from her eyes
18-06-2018T00:20:03,FenceEqualizer,"Forever alone Kat, she's just going to have to grab him by the collar and shake him while screaming ""Notiiiiice me!"""
18-06-2018T00:21:47,unsteddyphoenix,She really...needs to move on lol.
18-06-2018T00:21:57,unsteddyphoenix,The sisterzone is not a zone you can escape from
18-06-2018T00:22:43,unsteddyphoenix,though I suppose a lifetime affection is pretty rough
18-06-2018T00:23:07,Bgrmystr2,sisterzone is not quite impossible to escape from
18-06-2018T00:23:57,unsteddyphoenix,bgr im going to have to ask you to pipe down and not go anywhere close to where youre going with that.
18-06-2018T00:24:15,FenceEqualizer,"To be fair, not a lot of time has passed technically since then"
18-06-2018T00:25:16,FenceEqualizer,That and Eric is oblivious to her true feeling
18-06-2018T00:25:43,unsteddyphoenix,Ehh
18-06-2018T00:26:06,unsteddyphoenix,Is he really though
18-06-2018T00:26:23,unsteddyphoenix,Im unconvinced
18-06-2018T00:27:24,Twokinds,Now I'm wondering why no one's ever suggested Kat making a mad grab for the bouquet.
18-06-2018T00:28:31,FenceEqualizer,"Heh, If the wedding actually happens I'm sure you get a fight club of bouquet suggestions"
18-06-2018T00:28:59,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, theres gonna be so many ""background wedding"" suggests"
18-06-2018T00:30:32,Bgrmystr2,there's no suggestions cuz there was no concept of the wedding yet
18-06-2018T00:30:40,Bgrmystr2,or not a very big one
18-06-2018T00:30:54,Bgrmystr2,"now that you've brought it up with the page, NOW you can expect suggestions."
18-06-2018T00:31:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"“See this bundle of colored leaves, Eric? Get over here and say ‘I do’”"
18-06-2018T00:31:52,Bgrmystr2,"also, phoenix sounding a little defensive lol :P"
18-06-2018T00:32:01,FenceEqualizer,"Huh? Oh yes the autumn leaves sure looks nice"""
18-06-2018T00:32:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I would not be surprised if that was the response he gave
18-06-2018T00:33:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Kat: Where’s the bartender
18-06-2018T00:40:02,FenceEqualizer,Plot twist: Eric is well aware of Kay's feelings and being the horn dog he is is unsure how to respond to actual feelings of love
18-06-2018T00:47:26,SpazztasticKiwi,So you’re saying Eric is in a constant state of panic and adapts by finding distractions
18-06-2018T00:47:41,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s called anxiety
18-06-2018T00:51:10,unsteddyphoenix,Im not sure that's what he's saying
18-06-2018T00:56:54,FenceEqualizer,Not sure it would be anxiety.
18-06-2018T00:57:51,FenceEqualizer,Maybe a phobia! I'm sure there's a phobia out there for it.
18-06-2018T00:58:22,FenceEqualizer,Philophobia
18-06-2018T00:59:46,unsteddyphoenix,Is there a fear of commitment?
18-06-2018T00:59:58,unsteddyphoenix,Oh there is. Gamophobia.
18-06-2018T01:00:54,BadFoMo,Plot twist twist! Eric thinks Kathrin sees him as her brother and wouldn't want a Human as a lover. ...Or he's trying to push her away so he won't moun her passing and/or so that she can live her life.
18-06-2018T01:00:54,FenceEqualizer,Who comes up with these names
18-06-2018T01:01:24,unsteddyphoenix,good question
18-06-2018T01:03:06,FenceEqualizer,Dang Tom's not here. Mofo made me wonder what a phobia of Keidrans would be called.
18-06-2018T01:03:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I know what he was getting at
18-06-2018T01:04:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Makes me think of shy guy/girl syndrome
18-06-2018T01:06:55,FenceEqualizer,Hey that's what kid me has!
18-06-2018T01:07:58,Bgrmystr2,I'm not convinced that eric knows about kat's feelings
18-06-2018T01:08:00,FenceEqualizer,Literally jumped on my bike and peddled like I was on a cross country race to my house.
18-06-2018T01:08:15,Bgrmystr2,the way he presents himself doesn't speak for that
18-06-2018T01:08:48,FenceEqualizer,Maybe he's realllllly good at faking obliviousness
18-06-2018T01:09:01,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, I dunno"
18-06-2018T01:09:05,FenceEqualizer,(Though for the record I don't believe it either)
18-06-2018T01:09:30,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, ""acting normal"" is what he'd do if he knew. Which makes it hard to tell lol."
18-06-2018T01:09:41,Bgrmystr2,"with so many different situations, I'm fairly sure he wouldn't be capable of nailing every single one the way he did without actually feeling that way"
18-06-2018T01:09:50,unsteddyphoenix,He might try distance himself from Kat.
18-06-2018T01:10:13,unsteddyphoenix,After the confession I feel like theyve barely been in the same scene together
18-06-2018T01:10:48,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, after the confession and subsequent rejection I should say"
18-06-2018T01:11:48,FenceEqualizer,That is true Eric hasn't had many times to be oblivious. Not counting The sketches of course
18-06-2018T01:12:30,unsteddyphoenix,"Alternatively, it could be that he's always known."
18-06-2018T01:12:50,unsteddyphoenix,"If that were the case, his behaviour wouldnt change"
18-06-2018T01:13:21,unsteddyphoenix,"I mean damn, even Evals and Mike knew, and theyre not exactly the brightest bulbs."
18-06-2018T01:14:51,Bgrmystr2,they're 3rd party
18-06-2018T01:14:59,Bgrmystr2,1st party is dum
18-06-2018T01:15:04,Bgrmystr2,and won't ever see
18-06-2018T01:15:24,Bgrmystr2,"tis how it goes, noone ever bothers to tell the 1st party"
18-06-2018T01:15:29,unsteddyphoenix,That anime trope doesnt apply to intellectual types like Eric
18-06-2018T01:15:35,unsteddyphoenix,That'd be more of a Trace-thing
18-06-2018T01:15:38,Bgrmystr2,xD yes it very much does
18-06-2018T01:15:42,Bgrmystr2,it applies to EVERYONE
18-06-2018T01:15:52,Bgrmystr2,it's not just an anime trope either
18-06-2018T01:15:58,unsteddyphoenix,No dude he has glasses
18-06-2018T01:16:06,Bgrmystr2,yes cuz that changes anything xD
18-06-2018T01:16:09,unsteddyphoenix,All he has to do is press them up his nose and he KNOWS EVERYTHING
18-06-2018T01:16:18,Bgrmystr2,"Sage, is that you?"
18-06-2018T01:17:08,Bgrmystr2,no response. I can only suspect the worst. :ptv-unimpressed:
18-06-2018T01:17:32,unsteddyphoenix,Rem is best waifu!
18-06-2018T01:17:49,Bgrmystr2,I KNEW IT!@ :ptv-pouty:
18-06-2018T01:17:58,FenceEqualizer,:ptv-grossedout:
18-06-2018T01:19:26,unsteddyphoenix,"Honestly, if it was reveal that Eric knows/always known I wouldnt be surprised."
18-06-2018T01:19:36,unsteddyphoenix,Its still most likely that he somehow still has no idea
18-06-2018T01:19:41,unsteddyphoenix,'cause that's the silly trope.
18-06-2018T01:20:51,unsteddyphoenix,"but idk. How do you misinterpret Kats confession lol, she was pretty clear."
18-06-2018T01:21:10,Bgrmystr2,"I'm more inclined to believe that he doesn't know cuz if he did know, there's no damn way he could have pulled off the reactions he did so genuinely"
18-06-2018T01:21:47,Bgrmystr2,which page was it again?
18-06-2018T01:23:41,unsteddyphoenix,654
18-06-2018T01:24:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Nite
18-06-2018T01:24:11,unsteddyphoenix,Gnight~
18-06-2018T01:24:17,unsteddyphoenix,After that Kat spent most of her time with Nat
18-06-2018T01:25:02,unsteddyphoenix,"And then she wasnt in for a while, then Zen."
18-06-2018T01:25:50,Bgrmystr2,"yeah well, off-screen stuff we don't see so"
18-06-2018T01:26:14,unsteddyphoenix,"RIght, so I dont know what youre basing ""erics reactions"" on lol"
18-06-2018T01:26:23,FenceEqualizer,Night also Unsteddy beat me
18-06-2018T01:26:38,Bgrmystr2,basically everything else before that?
18-06-2018T01:26:51,Bgrmystr2,and during that?
18-06-2018T01:27:16,FenceEqualizer,Wait 654 or 660? Also holy hell I refuse to believe Eric doesn't know now
18-06-2018T01:27:31,Bgrmystr2,654 when she told him
18-06-2018T01:27:51,FenceEqualizer,Or rather I refuse to believe he does rather
18-06-2018T01:28:17,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh you mean, on page 660?"
18-06-2018T01:28:26,FenceEqualizer,Because if he's aware he's a damn good actor
18-06-2018T01:28:45,unsteddyphoenix,"He couldnt pull off that reaction? He had time to prepare that speech, that's not hard."
18-06-2018T01:29:24,FenceEqualizer,Then later on when Kat practically challenge Eric with that brother line.
18-06-2018T01:29:24,Bgrmystr2,"preparing it and pulling it off are two very different things, one much more difficult than the other"
18-06-2018T01:29:40,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, it was still pretty genuine on his part"
18-06-2018T01:29:55,Bgrmystr2,"if anything, Eric thought that Kat wanted to be family, not just servant, on 654"
18-06-2018T01:30:29,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, that's the face value"
18-06-2018T01:30:46,unsteddyphoenix,"Lol it's so ruthless. ""I'll always consider you family. ""NOTHING WILL EVER CHANGE THAT."" oof."
18-06-2018T01:31:13,Bgrmystr2,"if you married someone, would you not consider them family? :thinking:"
18-06-2018T01:31:47,unsteddyphoenix,Im not sure i'd marry someone who i'd consider family...
18-06-2018T01:32:12,unsteddyphoenix,"Idk, even marrying a step-sister is strange"
18-06-2018T01:32:19,unsteddyphoenix,It's not like I cant see where Eric is coming from.
18-06-2018T01:32:50,Bgrmystr2,"I consider all of my friends, including girls, as family. None of them have any relation to me, so I'm not really seeing it."
18-06-2018T01:33:12,Bgrmystr2,friends IRL anyway
18-06-2018T01:34:01,unsteddyphoenix,"If you ever say ""youre like a brother to me"" i'm going to have to reject you sorry. :/"
18-06-2018T01:34:15,unsteddyphoenix,Im not ready for marriage
18-06-2018T01:34:23,Bgrmystr2,hahahaha
18-06-2018T01:34:35,FenceEqualizer,That is not how that works and you know it!
18-06-2018T01:34:42,Bgrmystr2,agree w/ fence xD
18-06-2018T01:35:01,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, if you marry someone you wouldn't consider family based on how close you are"
18-06-2018T01:35:04,Bgrmystr2,you're doing it wrong
18-06-2018T01:35:33,FenceEqualizer,Brother/Sista from another mother
18-06-2018T01:35:39,Bgrmystr2,yup
18-06-2018T01:35:53,unsteddyphoenix,People dont generally use that term for significant others
18-06-2018T01:36:01,unsteddyphoenix,"And by generally I mean ""ever"""
18-06-2018T01:36:07,Bgrmystr2,maybe it's just around there
18-06-2018T01:36:12,Bgrmystr2,we do around here
18-06-2018T01:36:14,Bgrmystr2,everyone does

18-06-2018T01:36:40,Bgrmystr2,"I mean ""The United States"" but okay"
18-06-2018T01:36:45,Bgrmystr2,xD

18-06-2018T01:46:16,Bgrmystr2,and make poor phoenix lose his marbles
18-06-2018T01:53:08,FenceEqualizer,Well at least Eric would get the message then. Even if traumatized
18-06-2018T02:02:45,unsteddyphoenix,That...is true...

18-06-2018T21:38:34,Dadrobit,Was it running particularly fast?
18-06-2018T21:40:15,FenceEqualizer,I demand you stop living up to your name!
18-06-2018T21:41:54,Dadrobit,"Sorry, wordplay gets to be kind of my thing sometimes."
18-06-2018T21:42:16,Dadrobit,Don't even have any kidrobits.
18-06-2018T21:44:04,Dadrobit,"Also, Pokemon is trolling me right now. Trying to breed a male Gastly, 50/50 gender split. Hatched 7 eggs now, all female."
18-06-2018T21:44:33,unsteddyphoenix,Yiu want a male gengar? Why?
18-06-2018T21:46:56,Dadrobit,"Breeding with my Gardevoir to get an egg move called Mean look on a male Ralts. Force it to not evolve until it has Hypnosis, then get it to Gallade where I can teach it Thunder Wave and False Swipe."
18-06-2018T21:47:10,Dadrobit,Catcher Slave.
18-06-2018T21:49:57,unsteddyphoenix,To catch legendaries?
18-06-2018T21:50:11,Dadrobit,Legendaries and whatever else.
18-06-2018T21:51:18,Dadrobit,Only about 2/3s of the way through the main game atm.
18-06-2018T21:51:55,Dadrobit,"Been working with a Farfetch'd, but I want to get an upgrade."
18-06-2018T21:52:15,unsteddyphoenix,Lol playing extra safe then
18-06-2018T21:52:32,unsteddyphoenix,NO chance of escape
18-06-2018T21:52:41,Dadrobit,S'what the Mean Look is for.
18-06-2018T21:55:21,Dadrobit,Otherwise I was just swapping in Venusaur for Sleep Powder and calling it good. But that's effort.
18-06-2018T21:55:41,Dadrobit,And doesn't always work.
18-06-2018T21:56:53,Dadrobit,Fucking Finally.
18-06-2018T21:57:01,Dadrobit,11 eggs to get one male.
18-06-2018T21:57:02,FenceEqualizer,Always save scumming
18-06-2018T21:57:08,FenceEqualizer,Jeebus
18-06-2018T21:57:34,Dadrobit,Wonder trade's about to get an influx of level 1 female gastlys.
18-06-2018T21:57:41,unsteddyphoenix,Are you gonna min max evtrain against the ai too?
18-06-2018T21:58:13,Dadrobit,"Yeah, gonna focus attack to get up my false swipe. Then HP and Speed."
18-06-2018T21:58:47,Dadrobit,Don't care quite enough to breed perfect IVs.
18-06-2018T21:58:53,FenceEqualizer,But evtraining takes away the spirit of the game! \jk
18-06-2018T22:00:57,unsteddyphoenix,Youngster joey gonna get destroyed
18-06-2018T22:02:07,SpazztasticKiwi,:ctwokinds-natanisleep:
18-06-2018T22:02:11,Dadrobit,TBH I'm actually terrible at Pokemon. I'm the guy that just breezes by on his starter and calls it good.
18-06-2018T22:02:45,Dadrobit,Though in this playthrough I'm using a Lucario for that purpose.
18-06-2018T22:02:56,unsteddyphoenix,You furry
18-06-2018T22:03:10,Dadrobit,"Nah, he's just a bro."
18-06-2018T22:03:45,Dadrobit,Was a protagonist in one of the older Pokemon movies and it just stuck that all Lucarios are badass.
18-06-2018T22:04:18,Dadrobit,And in X/Y Lucarios get an extra evolution so they're Uber powerful.
18-06-2018T22:08:51,Dadrobit,Also had a pretty gnarly fight in the TV show where it fucking brutalized Pikachu.
18-06-2018T22:08:53,Dadrobit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GhwWBBkMzM&t=2m00s
18-06-2018T22:08:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Only game I really play is Tropic Escape
18-06-2018T22:09:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Phone games are the only thing I can use to waste waiting times
18-06-2018T22:11:00,SpazztasticKiwi,And YouTube
18-06-2018T22:22:01,Dadrobit,Pokemon was my jam back when I was in security.
18-06-2018T22:22:25,Dadrobit,12 hour graveyard shifts every weekend meant lots and lots of battling.
18-06-2018T22:22:55,Dadrobit,"Well, Pokemon, watching Tom, and Rooster Teeth."
18-06-2018T22:23:54,Dadrobit,I almost miss it. Getting paid to do damned near nothing for half a day was a good gig.
18-06-2018T22:30:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"Aside from sleeping, not much you can do to occupy yourself with that"
18-06-2018T22:32:55,Dadrobit,"Pretty much. We had our cameras to monitor, a home gym in the closet to use, and I jogged around the perimeter every half hour or hour or so."
18-06-2018T22:33:27,Dadrobit,"Other than that, there were nights where I would get on at 5:30 and not see anyone until the paper lady came in at 4am the next morning."
18-06-2018T22:34:15,Dadrobit,Literally one interaction all night. Drove me insane early on when I didn't yet even have a smart phone.
18-06-2018T22:34:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"Day 4: I have counted all 3,624 ceiling tiles. Next - the floor"
18-06-2018T22:34:46,Dadrobit,The floor was 7 concrete slabs.
18-06-2018T22:35:03,Dadrobit,The ceiling was spackled.
18-06-2018T22:35:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Did you find the partridge in the pear tree?
18-06-2018T22:35:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Count the spackles
18-06-2018T22:36:14,Dadrobit,I tried to not look at the ceiling too much. It was off by a teensy-tiny angle.
18-06-2018T22:36:38,SpazztasticKiwi,That would bother me more than the boredom
18-06-2018T22:36:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember when I did back drive at McDonald’s
18-06-2018T22:37:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"Or *McHell, sorry. Autocorrect"
18-06-2018T22:39:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tiny cube, 8 hours a day, one lunch that you were never really guaranteed was going to me 30 minutes or an hour nor when you’d be allowed to ho"
18-06-2018T22:39:13,SpazztasticKiwi,*go
18-06-2018T22:39:28,SpazztasticKiwi,*be
18-06-2018T22:40:46,Dadrobit,The shack I worked in was actually pretty nice. It was bigger than my first rental actually. But there were some elements that were skimped on.
18-06-2018T22:40:47,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/rw2rsjK.jpg
18-06-2018T22:41:13,Dadrobit,9:00 Log: Monitored cameras. Still dead.
18-06-2018T22:41:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"Not taking into account the fact they pay little and treatment is rather shit, I can’t stand standing in one spot doing the same thing constantly"
18-06-2018T22:41:54,Dadrobit,"Ah yeah, bad management was lots of the reason that I left."
18-06-2018T22:42:00,TheBeckoner,Autozone has been good to me so far mostly. Manager isnt the best at listening tho
18-06-2018T22:42:08,Dadrobit,Was getting shafted unreasonably hard.
18-06-2018T22:42:13,TheBeckoner,sounds nice
18-06-2018T22:42:33,TheBeckoner,I will take that as a sex pun thing
18-06-2018T22:43:16,Dadrobit,"Couldn't get a day off to save my life, and I was getting mandatory overtime that would turn my 12 hour shift into shifts upwards of 16 hours which was causing me to actually miss classes."
18-06-2018T22:43:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"It wasn’t necessarily bad management. Only had issues with one, and I’m not even sure if that story counts since she just got in trouble and disappeared and she and I never had individual issues"
18-06-2018T22:43:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"Getting days off was mandated by the GM, and she rarely granted it"
18-06-2018T22:45:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"Those two messages have different “shes”, btw"
18-06-2018T22:45:32,Dadrobit,"I don't mind if you tell me ""No."" But don't tell me, ""I'm working on it,"" or ""yeah, I got you the day off,"" and fucking lie to me about it."
18-06-2018T22:45:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Dude
18-06-2018T22:45:48,SpazztasticKiwi,One thing
18-06-2018T22:45:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I hate most
18-06-2018T22:45:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Is lying
18-06-2018T22:46:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I will go postal
18-06-2018T22:46:31,Dadrobit,"""Oh, I could have sworn I saw on the schedule that you had the day off? My bad. Try asking one of the other officers to maybe cover for you?"""
18-06-2018T22:46:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel the pain
18-06-2018T22:47:02,Dadrobit,"Oh, sure. Let me ask the officers with the exact same schedule as myself if they want to be in two places at once."
18-06-2018T22:47:17,Dadrobit,Fucking T O M O R R O W
18-06-2018T22:47:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Like with Walmart. It’s not awful. We’re going through some changes that is to new rules
18-06-2018T22:47:57,Dadrobit,Three times that happened. Twice I was able to bribe someone else to come in. The last time I just said fuck it and called in sick.
18-06-2018T22:48:28,SpazztasticKiwi,But our sink sprayer was leaking really hot water and it took them literal months to get it replaced
18-06-2018T22:49:00,Dadrobit,"The third time I had put in advance notice 2 months in advance and was in weekly contact with the site supervisor about getting my time off and getting, ""Oh, yeah, absolutely I'll get you the day off."""
18-06-2018T22:50:16,SpazztasticKiwi,It was a health/safety violation and the only reason it got fixed is because the health man came for an inspection and they didn’t want (and couldn’t afford) him seeing it
18-06-2018T22:50:18,Dadrobit,"And wouldn't you know that when the schedule came in, I didn't have the day off and I couldn't get in contact with the boss because.... Drum-roll Please!"
18-06-2018T22:50:34,SpazztasticKiwi,They were on vacay
18-06-2018T22:50:35,SpazztasticKiwi,?
18-06-2018T22:50:44,Dadrobit,HE WAS ON VACATION FOR 2 WEEKS STARTING YESTERDAY
18-06-2018T22:51:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I knew it
18-06-2018T22:51:15,Dadrobit,I'm actually angry just thinking about it.
18-06-2018T22:51:34,Dadrobit,That was almost 2 years ago and it still fucking gets to me.
18-06-2018T22:51:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I get salty thinking about what McHell put me through
18-06-2018T22:52:41,SpazztasticKiwi,But that’s how we came across Bagheera so...
18-06-2018T22:52:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Not a total loss
18-06-2018T22:52:55,Dadrobit,Sorry about ranting btw.
18-06-2018T22:53:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I was ranting too
18-06-2018T22:53:24,SpazztasticKiwi,We can have a rant riot
18-06-2018T22:53:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I can fuss with the best of em
18-06-2018T22:54:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"And it’s healthy to get it out, at least. I grumble to the cats sometimes"
18-06-2018T22:54:54,Dadrobit,I try not to vent too much in open forums though. Seems uncouth to do it too often. Don't want it becoming part of my image ya know?
18-06-2018T22:55:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Yea. I tend to talk and move on most things
18-06-2018T22:56:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Hanging on the past doesn’t change it - just raises your blood pressure
18-06-2018T22:57:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Discuss and dismiss. More is ahead
18-06-2018T22:59:06,Dadrobit,Used to post a lot on the forums. They had a nice dedicated vent thread you could post in. But I don't hit that place up as much as I used to.
18-06-2018T23:04:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Some people take airing out the dirty laundy too far?
18-06-2018T23:12:13,Dadrobit,"I mean, I don't have the finest of reputations on there regardless from my various escapades with unpopular opinions. But otherwise I just don't post as much as I used to period."
18-06-2018T23:12:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"Oh, but besides that, how’d you think Flora would look as a Justice card"
18-06-2018T23:12:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Tarot card that is
18-06-2018T23:13:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I get you though. Sometimes things fizzle out for you
18-06-2018T23:13:19,Dadrobit,"The forums were the place to be back in the day besides a few Skype chats that died. But now with a few large discords and Picarto giving us access to talk to Tom directly, the need for talking on the forums has diminished."
18-06-2018T23:13:50,Dadrobit,"Since about 2016 or so, it's fizzled out for a looooot of people."
18-06-2018T23:13:58,unsteddyphoenix,"ALso the forum seems to have like, ""generations"" of people"
18-06-2018T23:14:23,unsteddyphoenix,"And when you start seeing less and less of the people you recognis and more and more newbies, kinda gets less fun"
18-06-2018T23:14:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Just like a bad relationship. The spark is gone
18-06-2018T23:14:52,unsteddyphoenix,sometimes it be that way :T
18-06-2018T23:15:58,Bgrmystr2,I know that feel phoenix
18-06-2018T23:16:35,Dadrobit,For sure. the forums generations was a thing. But now even the overall population and post density has dropped drastically.
18-06-2018T23:16:42,Dadrobit,Is a thing*
18-06-2018T23:17:40,Dadrobit,Used to be there'd be multiple posts across the various threadnoughts daily. Now I see updates to things like the Smile thread only getting a new post once or twice a week.
18-06-2018T23:18:23,unsteddyphoenix,Really? Huh..
18-06-2018T23:18:24,Dadrobit,"Outside of the comic page, and a few forum games threads, nothing gets that kind of attention anymore."
18-06-2018T23:18:32,unsteddyphoenix,Yet twokinds seems more popular than ever
18-06-2018T23:19:00,unsteddyphoenix,Maan I remember playing mafia in those text games
18-06-2018T23:19:17,unsteddyphoenix,The narrator would write really long silly detailed stories
18-06-2018T23:19:27,unsteddyphoenix,That was a lot of fun~
18-06-2018T23:19:43,unsteddyphoenix,We lost almost every time but still~
18-06-2018T23:20:44,Dadrobit,"Never got into the forum games other than ""Corrupt a Wish"". The only active ones anymore are ""Last man Posting"" and ""Guess who will post next""."
18-06-2018T23:22:17,unsteddyphoenix,ugh those sound so boring~
18-06-2018T23:23:19,Dadrobit,"Oh, and the General Chat Thread. Was active in there. But that died off in late 2016 after Schrad and Spero left with their respective drama bombs."
18-06-2018T23:23:49,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I really don't get how those keep going..."
18-06-2018T23:24:28,unsteddyphoenix,"Nothing is safe from ""drama"" anymore it seems."
18-06-2018T23:25:05,FenceEqualizer,People thrive off of drama sadly
18-06-2018T23:25:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Some
18-06-2018T23:25:56,Dadrobit,"Eh, it's the forums. They've had their drama bombs since as long as I've been there. Taina, HWSNBN, Spero, different explosions, same fallout."
18-06-2018T23:25:58,unsteddyphoenix,Especially those darn floofy-people enthusiasts
18-06-2018T23:26:13,unsteddyphoenix,Im glad I dont recognise any of those names
18-06-2018T23:27:26,Dadrobit,"Taina was a ""fan"" who was really just a troll in disguise. Eventually left after she got outed as the person who got the admins for the official TK Facebook page falsely banned."
18-06-2018T23:27:42,Dadrobit,You know exactly who He Who Shall Not Be Named is.
18-06-2018T23:28:12,FenceEqualizer,"Yesh, glad I never touched the forums"
18-06-2018T23:28:19,Dadrobit,And Spero was a kid who made a few successful YouTube videos about Undertale when it was fresh and let it get to his head.
18-06-2018T23:28:24,unsteddyphoenix,"ah, right"
18-06-2018T23:34:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Anyone know who 23161488 is
18-06-2018T23:35:27,unsteddyphoenix,No?
18-06-2018T23:35:52,SpazztasticKiwi,They’re always here but they never speak
18-06-2018T23:36:08,SpazztasticKiwi,And they’re constantly changing their name color
18-06-2018T23:38:33,unsteddyphoenix,Hum
18-06-2018T23:38:52,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe they just made an account to watch NSFW streams but not chat
18-06-2018T23:39:04,unsteddyphoenix,Though dunno why their colours are changing
18-06-2018T23:59:39,Dadrobit,Manual mood ring.
