31-10-2018T12:04:14,Mippy,"Good morning, ugh, my throat has been scratchy since my teacher set off the fog machine in the studio yesterday"
31-10-2018T13:08:00,Twokinds,Mine too.
31-10-2018T13:08:04,Twokinds,Darn fog machine.
31-10-2018T13:48:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a slight crick in my neck because for some reason Bagheera slept half under me and was ok with that

31-10-2018T14:22:59,Twokinds,I didn't sleep very well last night.
31-10-2018T14:23:14,Twokinds,"Had nightmares, which is pretty unusual."
31-10-2018T14:27:40,Dadrobit,:( Sorry to hear that.
31-10-2018T14:27:48,TerraTheWizard,heck
31-10-2018T14:28:15,Twokinds,I guess it was holiday appropriate though.
31-10-2018T14:28:52,Dadrobit,Fair point I suppose.
31-10-2018T14:29:21,Dadrobit,Never actually got any visitors last night oddly enough.
31-10-2018T14:29:31,Dadrobit,Besides the two dogs that just kinda walked in.
31-10-2018T14:30:10,TerraTheWizard,i had to open the door once
31-10-2018T14:30:14,TerraTheWizard,then it rained
31-10-2018T14:30:30,TerraTheWizard,so now i have a bucket of candy to work through myself
31-10-2018T14:30:47,Twokinds,Best case
31-10-2018T14:45:29,FennexTheFox,My nightmare is a world where furries don't exist for companionship
31-10-2018T14:45:33,FennexTheFox,Oh wait :(
31-10-2018T14:46:37,RimaDraws,im so sorry to hear that tom

31-10-2018T15:05:45,Mippy,":ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake: Stresss!...yeah, I feel you there."
31-10-2018T15:15:46,RimaDraws,i understand that
31-10-2018T15:39:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"I have the weirdest dreams sometimes myself,I swear"
31-10-2018T15:44:25,SpazztasticKiwi,A few with people bursting into flames

31-10-2018T16:10:57,SpazztasticKiwi,But anyway I tested out an Edge today. Liked the Malibu but it‚Äôs windows were tinted abit dark

31-10-2018T16:13:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"The truck i fist saw was nice. Nice sized Toyota, dark and clean, liked it"
31-10-2018T16:13:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Already sold
31-10-2018T16:15:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"The Colorado was much the same but a different color, but it had huge tires and a slight lift kit so nah. Not to mention that meant $$$$"
31-10-2018T16:17:32,SpazztasticKiwi,The Malibu was such a lovely dark red

31-10-2018T16:20:20,Dadrobit,Have a recurring nightmare where my teeth are super britte and just keep shattering. It's actually just the worst.
31-10-2018T16:24:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe you need to floss more
31-10-2018T16:30:59,TerraTheWizard,i don't see how dancing would help
31-10-2018T16:37:58,SpazztasticKiwi,How dare you bring fortknite into this. Go to your corner

31-10-2018T16:59:47,Twokinds,Comicing the comic

31-10-2018T18:26:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Is having a cat supposed to be like being a human step stool
31-10-2018T18:27:30,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-KatDance: cats walk all over you like they just don't care
31-10-2018T18:29:13,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-karenOOO:
31-10-2018T18:29:46,BadFoMo,Nap time.
31-10-2018T18:29:58,Ordithus,have a good nap
31-10-2018T18:30:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah I tried that thirty minutes ago
31-10-2018T18:31:02,SpazztasticKiwi,No nap
31-10-2018T18:31:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I do have a cat suspiciously adamant about pets though
31-10-2018T18:37:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though today I saw they leveled two more houses in town. Looked perfectly decent houses, but it never seemed anyone would move in"
31-10-2018T18:37:53,Ordithus,Could be disasters on the inside
31-10-2018T18:38:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"Well one is suspected to have been empty for at least 20 years, which I know has to be enough time for anything from rats to goblins to move in"
31-10-2018T18:40:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Few more houses have gone up for sale too. Including the cutest lil white house with its own enclosed front porch
31-10-2018T18:50:41,Twokinds,buys
31-10-2018T18:54:00,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:
31-10-2018T18:56:00,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs got neighbors
31-10-2018T18:56:15,SpazztasticKiwi,But it‚Äôs away from the highway and major roads
31-10-2018T18:56:34,Mippy,I love abandoned buildings.
31-10-2018T18:56:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Though are you sure you‚Äôd move to Alabama?
31-10-2018T18:58:05,Mippy,:ctwokinds-kingtea:
31-10-2018T18:58:33,Twokinds,Alabama's probably cheap right?
31-10-2018T18:58:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Well yeah but
31-10-2018T18:59:01,Mippy,:shrug:
31-10-2018T18:59:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Most people tryin to leave here
31-10-2018T18:59:39,Twokinds,Really?
31-10-2018T18:59:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I am
31-10-2018T18:59:59,desertfenek,hi
31-10-2018T19:00:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Or at the very least leave this town
31-10-2018T19:00:21,Twokinds,Ah
31-10-2018T19:00:29,Twokinds,I don't know much about Alabama to be honest.
31-10-2018T19:00:29,Mippy,For some reason I thought you were from New Zeland...:ctwokinds-keifacepalm:
31-10-2018T19:00:48,Twokinds,No that's understeddy
31-10-2018T19:01:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"Like small towns can be great but the people aren‚Äôt quirky, their nosy and racist"
31-10-2018T19:01:15,SpazztasticKiwi,they‚Äôre
31-10-2018T19:01:21,Mippy,Ohhhhh...right county...wrong person
31-10-2018T19:01:24,Ordithus,"Kiwi is not, in fact, a Kiwi"
31-10-2018T19:02:12,Ordithus,Sort the table by Percent Increase https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_territories_of_the_United_States_by_population#State_rankings
31-10-2018T19:02:21,Ordithus,AL is pretty far down... TX is at the top
31-10-2018T19:02:58,SpazztasticKiwi,And my favorite complaint #stop-acting-gangster-you-are-white-and-there-are-cows-outside
31-10-2018T19:04:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"And I‚Äôd also figure it‚Äôd be an awful lot of work for you to move allll the way down from Ohio, Tom"
31-10-2018T19:07:08,Ordithus,"Once you leave town, it's all about the same"
31-10-2018T19:07:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"And while you may not know much about it, I can assure ya - Alabama (and the South) is not full of inbreds, though some here act like it"
31-10-2018T19:09:15,Mippy,The mountains that helped form  my home valley was full of inbreds
31-10-2018T19:09:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd like it down here ok, though so knock yourself out I guess. Don‚Äôt be afraid to be picky"
31-10-2018T19:10:09,Mippy,Or so I‚Äôm told
31-10-2018T19:10:37,SpazztasticKiwi,That sounds like some Hills Have Eyes bs there. I‚Äôm out
31-10-2018T19:12:00,Mippy,Look up the Goler Clan...
31-10-2018T19:12:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Charming
31-10-2018T19:13:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Think I need a shower now

31-10-2018T19:14:54,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floAAA:
31-10-2018T19:18:20,SpazztasticKiwi,very Hills Have Eyes
31-10-2018T19:18:22,Ordithus,I sign my life to the bank Wednesday
31-10-2018T19:19:51,Mippy,Good luck with that
31-10-2018T19:20:24,Bgrmystr2,"My condolences to the rest of your life, Ord"
31-10-2018T19:20:31,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-FloDance: thanks
31-10-2018T19:20:55,Bgrmystr2,may it one day forgive you for the bad decisions you make now.
31-10-2018T19:22:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Dude that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve saved to pay my stuff in full
31-10-2018T19:22:48,SpazztasticKiwi,You‚Äôre in our hopes n prayers
31-10-2018T19:23:18,Mippy,"Yeah, no more debts for us either. Pay in full...always"
31-10-2018T19:23:50,Ordithus,It'll be my first debt in years
31-10-2018T19:24:15,Bgrmystr2,I don't own a bank account. Period.
31-10-2018T19:24:18,Bgrmystr2,I don't plan to
31-10-2018T19:24:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"That does beg the question, albeit it‚Äôs likely a stupid question all things considered, but Tom - how‚Äôs the hunt?"
31-10-2018T19:24:57,Bgrmystr2,"I have debit with paypal and I can get credit with it too. There's several online banks that don't  charge a dime for you to let them hold your money, no matter how little."
31-10-2018T19:25:42,Ordithus,"My bank doesn't charge me anything, aside from the interest in my savings being less than inflation"
31-10-2018T19:26:15,Mippy,I get my fees back around tax time.
31-10-2018T19:26:35,Mippy,So I don‚Äôt worry about that
31-10-2018T19:27:13,Bgrmystr2,"that's probably because you have direct deposit, Ord"
31-10-2018T19:27:24,Ordithus,I do
31-10-2018T19:27:27,Bgrmystr2,yeah see
31-10-2018T19:27:38,Bgrmystr2,"if you don't have it, they'll charge you like $8 a month or someshit"
31-10-2018T19:27:42,Bgrmystr2,it's retarded
31-10-2018T19:28:02,Bgrmystr2,"you need some ridiculous amount, like $500+ to even stop them from taking any"
31-10-2018T19:28:20,Bgrmystr2,"tis why I use paypal, cuz they're not arsehats"
31-10-2018T19:28:26,Bgrmystr2,..for the most part.
31-10-2018T19:29:01,Mippy,American banks are ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù
31-10-2018T19:29:18,SpazztasticKiwi,My bank allows many exceptions to not be charged a service fee
31-10-2018T19:29:22,Bgrmystr2,nothing interesting about a for-profit business that makes money off stealing from the little ppl
31-10-2018T19:30:11,Mippy,^hence the bunny ears
31-10-2018T19:30:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you meet just one requirement with your direct deposit or deposits in general, no fee"
31-10-2018T19:31:25,SpazztasticKiwi,And the card tracking is like an overprotective mother
31-10-2018T19:32:18,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúWho‚Äôs this? Why this purchase? Are you sure it‚Äôs you - it‚Äôs from xxx and you‚Äôre not from there. You didn‚Äôt mention you‚Äôd be near there. You‚Äôve never been there.‚Äù
31-10-2018T19:33:25,Bgrmystr2,"there's only two requirements for all the banks here. minimum balance or direct deposit. Kinda hard to get half a grand as a teenager, and it's also damn impossible to get direct deposit if you're still going to school"
31-10-2018T19:33:27,Bgrmystr2,so..
31-10-2018T19:33:29,Bgrmystr2,asking a bit much
31-10-2018T19:34:00,Bgrmystr2,also yeah that's why I have debit xD
31-10-2018T19:34:04,Bgrmystr2,none of the tracking bs
31-10-2018T19:34:12,Bgrmystr2,but all of the protection
31-10-2018T19:34:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh it‚Äôll track your debit too
31-10-2018T19:34:24,Ordithus,"Unfortunately not all the protection, but eh"
31-10-2018T19:34:58,Bgrmystr2,"well yeah it'll track my debit, but obviously I'm not gonna be buying $1500+ with of garbage from Russia.."
31-10-2018T19:35:00,Bgrmystr2,so I mean
31-10-2018T19:35:02,Bgrmystr2,duh
31-10-2018T19:35:03,Mippy,Dang...here you just make an appointment and set up an account. I work with 13 year olds who have accounts
31-10-2018T19:35:18,Bgrmystr2,banks here are trash
31-10-2018T19:35:24,Ordithus,"I'm American, and I had an account at 5"
31-10-2018T19:35:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I take my time with most decisions. Rather be picky than stupid
31-10-2018T19:36:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I technically have an separate account but it‚Äôs my dad‚Äôs dad‚Äôs. His investment in us (the grandchildren) for when he dies
31-10-2018T19:37:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Which I wonder about that cause he‚Äôs all the way in California and idk if they‚Äôll require us to show in person. Or if my dad‚Äôs shit brother will try contesting anything
31-10-2018T19:38:51,Mippy,Think it will turn into 13 Dead End Drive? :ctwokinds-floraquestion:
31-10-2018T19:39:06,Mippy,(Probably not)
31-10-2018T19:40:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Nah. Dad‚Äôs brother isn‚Äôt a fun or good man but he‚Äôs not good at fights as far as I figure
31-10-2018T19:40:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve never met him
31-10-2018T19:42:56,Dadrobit,"Late to the party, but I quite like my credit union. Super helpful folks every time I've talked with them and opened accounts."
31-10-2018T19:43:25,Dadrobit,"Helped me set up my business, and ther's next to no fees for anything except overdraft."
31-10-2018T19:44:14,Dadrobit,Minimum balance for an account is $25. So totally negligable.
31-10-2018T19:44:25,Dadrobit,negligible*
31-10-2018T19:46:04,Ordithus,"When it comes to buying a house without a mortgage... yeah, no"
31-10-2018T19:46:47,Dadrobit,not sure what you mean?
31-10-2018T19:47:41,Ordithus,That's a lot of money to save up
31-10-2018T19:48:11,Dadrobit,"Yeah, so you get enough for a down payment on a mortgage."
31-10-2018T19:48:19,Ordithus,Yep
31-10-2018T19:48:33,Mippy,Our house is the only debt we want. XD
31-10-2018T19:48:47,Dadrobit,Credit unions can handle mortgages.
31-10-2018T19:49:37,Dadrobit,"Been talking w/ mine for a while now, in the middle of saving up for one so I can stop renting from my folks. As nice as that is."
31-10-2018T19:55:40,Dadrobit,"Not looking for a mansion, but I'd kill for some little place like this. https://www.zillow.com/homes/for_sale/pmf,pf_pt/8664216_zpid/150000-250000_price/624-1040_mp/priced_sort/33.514778,-111.483164,33.410666,-111.647273_rect/12_zm/?view=public"
31-10-2018T19:56:24,Twokinds,Ooo nice
31-10-2018T19:56:25,Dadrobit,"A little out of the way, but nice and close to the mountains."
31-10-2018T19:56:52,SpazztasticKiwi,That looks like what my cousin‚Äôs building
31-10-2018T19:57:19,SpazztasticKiwi,There is plenty of those types of houses out here
31-10-2018T19:57:39,Ordithus,Neato
31-10-2018T19:57:49,Mippy,I can see the potential. It‚Äôs cute.
31-10-2018T19:58:32,Ordithus,It's got a pond!
31-10-2018T19:58:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah
31-10-2018T19:58:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Mosquitos
31-10-2018T19:59:00,Mippy,Can you swim in it?
31-10-2018T19:59:02,Ordithus,"It's AZ, they'll dry up as soon as they leave the water"
31-10-2018T19:59:11,Dadrobit,"Absolutely love Western Desert aesthetic. Looks like it needs some work done on some of the outside fixtures, and the shed needs work."
31-10-2018T19:59:46,Dadrobit,That pond is probably fine from mosquitoes. The water is circulating.
31-10-2018T20:00:35,Dadrobit,Could probably have a goodly number of fish in there. Grandma has a similar one in her own back yard with some huge koi.
31-10-2018T20:00:38,Twokinds,"Seems a little on the expensive side for what you get, but I don't know the prices in Arizona."
31-10-2018T20:01:19,Dadrobit,"It's on the upper bounds of the ""cheaper"" side of housing."
31-10-2018T20:01:35,Dadrobit,I think the price is just mostly the lot size and the location.
31-10-2018T20:01:52,Dadrobit,And stuff like those trees add to the calue.
31-10-2018T20:01:56,Dadrobit,value*
31-10-2018T20:02:04,Dadrobit,Shade comes at a cost here.
31-10-2018T20:02:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"I found the house you said ‚Äúbuy‚Äù to, Tom"
31-10-2018T20:02:17,SpazztasticKiwi,https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/682-Midway-Dr-Winfield-AL-35594/104511258_zpid/
31-10-2018T20:04:30,Dadrobit,You can get a lot of permanent mobile homes for sub $80k that are 2 bed 1 bath kinda places.
31-10-2018T20:05:27,Twokinds,Yeah
31-10-2018T20:05:37,Dadrobit,"But as someone who lived in one for about 2 years, I'm done with that. I want a house."
31-10-2018T20:06:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"That one in particular has little for a yard, and it‚Äôs at the edge of its neighborhood"
31-10-2018T20:07:23,SpazztasticKiwi,But it‚Äôs close to town while also away from big roads
31-10-2018T20:08:08,Ordithus,Really can get a pretty nice house for the money there
31-10-2018T20:08:18,SpazztasticKiwi,But also - there‚Äôs plenty for sale around
31-10-2018T20:08:37,Twokinds,The only way to get prices like that around here are either forclosures or as-is cash only stuff with no pictures of the inside.
31-10-2018T20:09:06,Dadrobit,big oof
31-10-2018T20:09:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"I wouldn‚Äôt get it cause it was cute, but cramped"
31-10-2018T20:09:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"There‚Äôs another for sale behind the local Walmart that I kiiiind of like, but eh"
31-10-2018T20:09:52,Mippy,Housing prices around here are insane.
31-10-2018T20:12:49,Mippy,People charging over $1000 a month in rent for a 1 bed apartment...highway robbery
31-10-2018T20:12:59,Dadrobit,fuuuuuuck that
31-10-2018T20:13:02,Ordithus,Same here
31-10-2018T20:13:12,Dadrobit,shudders
31-10-2018T20:13:22,Ordithus,"Granted, those are the new fancy apartments"
31-10-2018T20:13:49,Twokinds,So much money!
31-10-2018T20:13:56,Twokinds,Just live in a car.
31-10-2018T20:13:58,Ordithus,"If you don't mind living in the cheap part of town, can be more like 600"
31-10-2018T20:14:04,Twokinds,Have 12000 dollars instead.
31-10-2018T20:14:24,Mippy,Easier to rent my bedroom from my parents and live at home. At least food is included.
31-10-2018T20:14:49,Ordithus,Story of the generation
31-10-2018T20:15:15,Mippy,Pretty much
31-10-2018T20:15:15,Dadrobit,"Technically, that's the story of most generations before WW2."
31-10-2018T20:15:32,Ordithus,"Technically correct, as usual, robit"
31-10-2018T20:15:54,Dadrobit,Moving out and having your own house only came on the back of the explosive growth of America during and immediately after the war.
31-10-2018T20:16:22,Dadrobit,Where getting a heckin good paying job was easy enough to do if you had a high school diploma.
31-10-2018T20:16:27,SpazztasticKiwi,They‚Äôre saying nowadays lots of people are opting to not get married (or at least get married later) and instead live in groups in a single non related or semi-related (couples) household
31-10-2018T20:18:30,Mippy,"If need at least two room mates to pay rent/mortgage and utilities. And while I‚Äôm in school I‚Äôm not marking as much as I normally would. Yup, better to stay put."
31-10-2018T20:19:06,Mippy,We‚Äôd be a house of starving artists
31-10-2018T20:19:43,SpazztasticKiwi,So aesthetic
31-10-2018T20:20:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Honestly you‚Äôd have to come browse in person if you wanted to make the most comfortable choice here
31-10-2018T20:21:34,Ordithus,":ctwokinds-flomad: ""I live in a van, down by the river!"""
31-10-2018T20:22:04,SpazztasticKiwi,And it helps house shopping anywhere if you‚Äôve been there before or know someone there
31-10-2018T20:22:47,Dadrobit,:/ Starving artist indeed. One of my impending issues in getting a decent rate on a mortgage is going to be my vocation.
31-10-2018T20:23:19,Dadrobit,VO is not exactly the most stable of careers unless you're a bigwig.
31-10-2018T20:23:50,Dadrobit,Going on 3 weeks here with only two new clients as it is. Feelspoorman.
31-10-2018T20:24:50,SpazztasticKiwi,So who‚Äôs ready to take a vacay and go touring/house scoping
31-10-2018T20:24:58,Dadrobit,The decision to put it on the backburner and try to get a nine to five gig as an engineer in a local studio.
31-10-2018T20:25:07,Dadrobit,Has passed my mind more than once.
31-10-2018T20:25:20,Ordithus,Not bad to have that in the backpocket
31-10-2018T20:26:12,Mippy,On
31-10-2018T20:26:19,Dadrobit,"Wrapping up cables, emptying trash bins, and cleaning the coke mirror. New Guy Engineer 101."
31-10-2018T20:27:14,Mippy,Ugh! I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm well past New Girl status at my crappy fast food job.
31-10-2018T20:29:08,Mippy,(Doing it for the $17.25 an hour)
31-10-2018T20:29:18,Dadrobit,Problem with local engineer gigs is that we have a ton of new guys graduating in the field every couple months from CRAS and MCC. So damn near every place out here is a revolving door.
31-10-2018T20:29:49,Dadrobit,$17.25 ain't bad!
31-10-2018T20:30:30,SpazztasticKiwi,where you live
31-10-2018T20:30:33,Dadrobit,"I mean, it's not gonna get you to 7 digits real fast, but you probably don't go hungry."
31-10-2018T20:30:39,Mippy,Nope! And that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt quit said fast food job. Took me six years to get up that high.
31-10-2018T20:30:54,Dadrobit,Ghettosville AZ

31-10-2018T20:32:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll be honest I‚Äôm tempted to visit Canada since the devil lettuce is legal

31-10-2018T20:32:56,Mippy,I don‚Äôt use it myself
31-10-2018T20:33:40,Dadrobit,"Yeah, big same. Never touch the stuff."
31-10-2018T20:33:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I smell bs
31-10-2018T20:34:24,Dadrobit,Completely clean.
31-10-2018T20:34:50,Mippy,I mean... even if I wanted too I couldn‚Äôt. Phychiatric meds yo
31-10-2018T20:35:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"And I‚Äôm married, since we wanna spout off information"
31-10-2018T20:35:36,Ordithus,I'm a great grandma
31-10-2018T20:35:39,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs not any good
31-10-2018T20:35:44,Dadrobit,"Huh, doctor tell you that, Mippy?"
31-10-2018T20:35:56,Dadrobit,Any specific interactions?
31-10-2018T20:36:30,SpazztasticKiwi,My meds say no smoking but I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs talking about cigarettes
31-10-2018T20:36:34,Dadrobit,"Just curious, because pops just started on some mood stabilizers and he's a much bigger pothead than me."
31-10-2018T20:37:13,SpazztasticKiwi,And the only warning against smoking is it‚Äôll decrease effectiveness
31-10-2018T20:37:25,Mippy,A whole list of stuff. Can‚Äôt drink either. Or take ibuprofens...
31-10-2018T20:37:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah no drink for me either
31-10-2018T20:38:08,Dadrobit,Damn...
31-10-2018T20:38:08,Mippy,I miss ibuprofen....it was magic for ‚Äúcramps‚Äù
31-10-2018T20:38:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I generally used Tylenol
31-10-2018T20:38:51,Dadrobit,Weed actually helped my mom stop taking ibu. No joke.
31-10-2018T20:38:51,Mippy,Tylenol makes me sick :shrug:
31-10-2018T20:39:06,SpazztasticKiwi,And warming pads
31-10-2018T20:39:12,Dadrobit,She stopped like 4 different meds plus the ibu she was taking like pez.
31-10-2018T20:39:37,SpazztasticKiwi,4 meds for lady cramps?
31-10-2018T20:40:10,Dadrobit,"Sleep aids, migraines, something something else, and ibu."
31-10-2018T20:41:11,Dadrobit,Now she mostly just takes CBD and very occasionally some otc stuff for flareups.
31-10-2018T20:42:02,Mippy,"Well, I stop taking my other meds and I bleed to death.... not much I can do about that. But yeah...I hear there is benefits to that stuff."
31-10-2018T20:42:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"If it was legal here, it‚Äôd probably help me some"
31-10-2018T20:42:19,Dadrobit,"Huh, have driven past these for years, now for sale and I can finally see inside. https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1027-N-Meridian-Rd-Apache-Junction-AZ-85120/8666106_zpid/"
31-10-2018T20:42:37,Dadrobit,"Ohhhh, yeah. Probably a bad time to bleed to death. I advise against that."
31-10-2018T20:43:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"Oh my meds help with the blood loss, too, but my iron, potassium and sodium slipping is what got me on it"
31-10-2018T20:44:04,Mippy,My iron was so low by the time I saw a doctor.
31-10-2018T20:44:08,Ordithus,"Those sure are weird, robit"
31-10-2018T20:45:05,Mippy,"Dad, those are really interesteing."
31-10-2018T20:45:27,SpazztasticKiwi,It was causing me to sleep so much I didn‚Äôt really eat or was hungry. Hence the potassium/sodium lowering
31-10-2018T20:45:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Did you lose weight from it too
31-10-2018T20:46:43,Mippy,"I was passing out, experiencing flashes of light, vomiting."
31-10-2018T20:46:58,Mippy,Probably dieing

31-10-2018T20:47:41,Bgrmystr2,clearly sand igloos
31-10-2018T20:47:45,Bgrmystr2,or some kind of rock igloo
31-10-2018T20:47:52,Dadrobit,Turn around twice and you've seen everything.
31-10-2018T20:48:07,Bgrmystr2,not exactly a fan of the design
31-10-2018T20:48:11,Bgrmystr2,"it's interesting, but meh"
31-10-2018T20:48:11,Dadrobit,An igloo with desert camo

31-10-2018T20:49:41,Ordithus,There was a really big house kinda like those for sale near here this summer
31-10-2018T20:49:49,Ordithus,"Made of wood, really weird"
31-10-2018T20:50:05,Ordithus,It was probably 50 feet tall
31-10-2018T20:51:51,Mippy,The most interesting building here is probably the collage . With its curves and rNdom stair cases
31-10-2018T20:52:24,Bgrmystr2,"I wouldn't mind spiral staircases, those are cool"
31-10-2018T20:52:26,Bgrmystr2,but random?
31-10-2018T20:52:30,Dadrobit,College I went to had a big library that looks like an opened book from above.
31-10-2018T20:52:31,Bgrmystr2,why random
31-10-2018T20:52:44,Ordithus,Stairs that go... to nowhere :cw0lfmare-PaperemberClose:
31-10-2018T20:52:49,Mippy,Ask the architect?
31-10-2018T20:53:16,Mippy,We do have a spiral staircase that leads to the IT department
31-10-2018T20:53:35,Bgrmystr2,it'd be like asking that guy why he made that painting with the stairs all sortsa wonky dimensions and shit
31-10-2018T20:53:44,Bgrmystr2,"""Why not"" - the artist, probably"
31-10-2018T20:54:30,Mippy,M.C Escher is the guy with the wonky staircase painting
31-10-2018T20:55:07,Bgrmystr2,isn't there a rapper with a similar name?
31-10-2018T20:55:21,Dadrobit,MC Hammer?
31-10-2018T20:55:40,Bgrmystr2,"Well no, I know him"
31-10-2018T20:56:00,Bgrmystr2,I thought I heard of a rapper with a an Escher name

31-10-2018T21:01:40,Mippy,That library could use more book. It needs to step up to the plate. That fountain is killing it.

31-10-2018T21:27:24,Dadrobit,nope
31-10-2018T21:27:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Hold on

31-10-2018T21:28:17,Dadrobit,Do I want to?
31-10-2018T21:29:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Only if you want I guess
31-10-2018T21:29:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I think it‚Äôs more of a cover remake thing
31-10-2018T21:29:58,SpazztasticKiwi,But I like it ok
31-10-2018T21:30:54,Dadrobit,"Ah yes. Nothing gets me in the mood better than hip hop ""yeah"" samples and trap beats."
31-10-2018T21:31:36,Dadrobit,"Not really a remake or cover, just an homage."
31-10-2018T21:31:52,Mippy,I find the Star Wars soundtracks work great for that Dad
31-10-2018T21:32:26,SpazztasticKiwi,The music video is like someone threw a sexytime cocktail bomb in the room
31-10-2018T21:32:44,Dadrobit,"Baby, you better Imperial March yourself to bed quick so we can Duel with our fates."
31-10-2018T21:33:16,Mippy,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA: why can‚Äôt someone ask me out with that line?
31-10-2018T21:34:00,Dadrobit,"I really wasn't all that find of the music video. Looked like it was going for hyper-parody, but the song itself was trying to take itself seriously. Weird clash."
31-10-2018T21:34:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I have heard the best pick up lines from needs I swear
31-10-2018T21:34:21,SpazztasticKiwi,nerds
31-10-2018T21:35:15,Dadrobit,Because we have so much time to ourselves that is spent outside of a relationship that we can just think about it nonstop. #QualitySadTruth
31-10-2018T21:36:10,Mippy,"Yeah, us nerds...we awesome like that"
31-10-2018T21:38:48,Mippy,The sketch of Dust and Fidget as each other was a sad reminder that I have to get back to playing that game. My commitment to game more is not going well. Between work and school I haven‚Äôt finished a single game this year.
31-10-2018T21:39:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I know this isn‚Äôt related but I just came across a joke I‚Äôd like to share
31-10-2018T21:39:32,Mippy,Joke
31-10-2018T21:39:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Lube: high fructose porn syrup

31-10-2018T21:41:34,Mippy,Can you make bread?
31-10-2018T21:41:40,Dadrobit,"I mean, you could."
31-10-2018T21:42:36,Dadrobit,Heard about a beer that recently started to market working off of the yeast in ladies undergarments. Yeast is yeast I suppose.
31-10-2018T21:42:46,SpazztasticKiwi,You‚Äôd be a brave soul...

31-10-2018T21:44:25,Mippy,I was making some strange searches that night
31-10-2018T21:44:51,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs nothing quite like the Internet rabbit hole at 2 am
31-10-2018T21:45:09,Dadrobit,"Hell, I'm not that desperate, but I'd try it. Did an eternity egg once, nothing can top that."
31-10-2018T21:45:25,Dadrobit,Century Egg*
31-10-2018T21:45:27,Mippy,Yup.... :ctwokinds-zenshocked: I‚Äôve seen some shit

31-10-2018T21:48:04,Mippy,"I hear Century Eggs are like gelatinous on the out side, creamy on the inside, and taste like fart. Can confirm?"
31-10-2018T21:48:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah no thanks I chose life
31-10-2018T21:48:43,SpazztasticKiwi,My body is my temple
31-10-2018T21:48:45,Dadrobit,Can confirm
31-10-2018T21:48:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Ancient and crumbling
31-10-2018T21:49:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Probably cursed or haunted
31-10-2018T21:49:09,Dadrobit,The whole thing was an experience honestly.

31-10-2018T21:50:24,Mippy,^Century Eggs
31-10-2018T21:50:34,Mippy,Dad ate one
31-10-2018T21:50:45,Dadrobit,"It wasn't terrible to the point of unbearable, but it's not something I'll order over something else."
31-10-2018T21:51:26,Dadrobit,I think it was more the scent than the taste that was bad.
31-10-2018T21:51:36,Ordithus,Limburger cheese is the same way
31-10-2018T21:51:41,Ordithus,"Smells awful, tastes meh"
31-10-2018T21:54:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"You know, I like trying new things but if I don‚Äôt like the taste of something, I feel the want to gag but I have very little gag reflex"
31-10-2018T21:54:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Do you see my problem
31-10-2018T21:54:43,Ordithus,:ptv-RainbowThrowup:
31-10-2018T21:54:46,Mippy,I don‚Äôt really remember having something that smells awful and taste meh. I‚Äôve had food that looks like someone took a dump on a plate and tasted good.
31-10-2018T21:55:02,Mippy,My gag is sensitive
31-10-2018T21:55:03,Bgrmystr2,"I'm rather the opposite, Kiwi. I sort of wish I had your situation"
31-10-2018T21:55:18,Dadrobit,I actually have a horrible gag reflex. But I can stomach stuff to at least try it once.
31-10-2018T21:55:19,Bgrmystr2,"my reflex is so strong, I can taste it if the smell is strong enough"
31-10-2018T21:55:31,Bgrmystr2,and that doesn't go very well
31-10-2018T21:55:50,Bgrmystr2,cuz then I'm not eating for the day cuz I can't get my mind off it
31-10-2018T21:56:13,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-grossedout: it's great
31-10-2018T21:56:20,Twokinds,I used to like limburger cheese on triscuits
31-10-2018T21:56:58,Twokinds,"My dad always ate it, so he got me into the stuff too. But I haven't had it in years."
31-10-2018T21:57:20,Mippy,"I have never had Limburger...I have,however, had triscuits"
31-10-2018T21:57:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Shopping trip?
31-10-2018T21:57:24,Dadrobit,Can't say I've ever had it.
31-10-2018T21:57:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I like the herb triskets
31-10-2018T21:57:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Never really put stuff on em
31-10-2018T21:58:13,Dadrobit,Cheese snobbery is one of those things I'd like to get into when I have expendable monry.
31-10-2018T21:58:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"Maybe try cream cheese with em or something, if not Muenster"
31-10-2018T21:59:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"Bad smells don‚Äôt bother me. I can straight face watch someone puke. Don‚Äôt like it, but I can live"
31-10-2018T22:00:06,Mippy,Our local selection is not that great so I would not know where to start with cheese snobby
31-10-2018T22:00:36,Ordithus,I go 5 miles south and I find myself in the land of cheese
31-10-2018T22:01:45,Mippy,"I mean I can get some usual stuff like smoked Gouda, bre"
31-10-2018T22:01:53,Mippy,"Feta, goat"

31-10-2018T22:02:20,Dadrobit,"Ohhh, local place has some amazing goat cheese."
31-10-2018T22:02:28,Dadrobit,spread it on a lot of stuff.
31-10-2018T22:02:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Goat cheese so creamy and gouda gooda
31-10-2018T22:02:46,Ordithus,agreed and agreed
31-10-2018T22:02:57,Mippy,I like bre. Tried Camelbet...I think I got a bad wheel. It tasted like sulfer
31-10-2018T22:03:54,Dadrobit,Hmmm. I think I might actually head out and buy some more. I've been out for a while...
31-10-2018T22:04:53,Mippy,The only thing I have in the fridge right now is cheddar for Mac and cheese
31-10-2018T22:05:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Smoked sharp or mild

31-10-2018T22:42:15,Dadrobit,"Also, caught up with some of the employees at the store. Hadn't seen some of them in a while. And there was a new girl I got to haze a little."
31-10-2018T22:43:35,Dadrobit,Caught her in the aisle with the salad dressings. Told her that all the separation going on was a sign that they were going bad and you could stop it by shaking them back up.
31-10-2018T22:44:31,Dadrobit,"She shook the whole aisle and found me as I was checking out to report that they were all ""fixed""."

31-10-2018T23:35:07,unsteddyphoenix,"I mean, depending on the support..."
31-10-2018T23:35:25,Twokinds,"Instead, saying you can't hold it for more than two months in a row, unless no one takes it for a few days. Or something."
31-10-2018T23:35:41,Dadrobit,"Ahhh, yeah, probably a thing that should happen."
