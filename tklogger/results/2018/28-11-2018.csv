28-11-2018T11:24:59,Sifty,"Hey what are basitins based off, if anything?"
28-11-2018T11:25:14,Sifty,"i've been wondering, and I always thought they kind of look like goats without horns and those weird rectangle eyes"
28-11-2018T11:28:48,Twokinds,They aren't directly based on any real animal.
28-11-2018T11:29:15,Twokinds,But their designs were largely inspired by the Viera from Final Fantasy.
28-11-2018T11:29:31,Twokinds,(Specifically FF:Tactics Advanced)
28-11-2018T11:30:31,Twokinds,"Well, I shouldn't say 'largely' as they're not particularly similiar now. 'originally inspired' is more accurate."

28-11-2018T13:17:49,TerraTheWizard,i don't understand what you mean
28-11-2018T13:19:14,EggRollss,The sketch that Tom drew scroll up a little and Nibbly bot posted it
28-11-2018T13:19:42,EggRollss,I think it will be #1 place on Sunday
28-11-2018T13:20:17,TerraTheWizard,"oh, for the colour vote"
28-11-2018T13:20:25,EggRollss,Ya
28-11-2018T13:20:50,TerraTheWizard,"ya confused me with ""number 1 for Sketch"""

28-11-2018T13:32:05,Xexanoth,touch fluffy tal
28-11-2018T13:36:07,CrimsonQuill,He just wants something to snuggle with.
28-11-2018T13:37:34,CrimsonQuill,Tom-I need your opinion on this. Hot milk. Camomile tea. An evening reading. Would this qualify to you as a great way to spend time before bed?
28-11-2018T13:41:03,Twokinds,"Uh... I suppose so, yeah."
28-11-2018T13:41:20,CrimsonQuill,Thanks! :ptv-victory:
28-11-2018T13:42:13,CrimsonQuill,It's just that I'm doing something like that tonight... (and have been for the past three days). It really helps me relax...especially when i read manga or a history book.
28-11-2018T13:42:29,CrimsonQuill,"Actually, have you ever heard of RG Veda?"
28-11-2018T13:45:04,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
28-11-2018T13:45:17,CrimsonQuill,??
28-11-2018T13:59:39,Twokinds,No
28-11-2018T14:00:10,CrimsonQuill,It's really good.
28-11-2018T14:00:17,CrimsonQuill,My little brother introduced me to it.
28-11-2018T14:00:38,CrimsonQuill,I've only read the first two of the three volumes-we haven't got the third yet.
28-11-2018T14:00:59,CrimsonQuill,"It's basically based on the Hindu Text the Veda, and it is reallly well written."
28-11-2018T14:02:39,CrimsonQuill,And drwan.
28-11-2018T14:02:43,CrimsonQuill,Drawn.
28-11-2018T14:02:46,CrimsonQuill,It's a manga
28-11-2018T14:18:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Someone tell the headache to go away
28-11-2018T14:19:14,CrimsonQuill,"@SpazztasticKiwi A quick rinse in a hot shower, or a cup of tea, might help."
28-11-2018T14:35:51,Twokinds,"Go away, headache! Shoo!"
28-11-2018T14:35:56,Twokinds,You don't belong in this world!
28-11-2018T14:36:16,CrimsonQuill,Return to the black pit whence you came!
28-11-2018T14:38:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"Speaking of black pits, Bagheera has arrived to demand pets"
28-11-2018T14:38:51,CrimsonQuill,I'm thinking more about Moria from lord of the Rings.
28-11-2018T14:46:29,CrimsonQuill,"Well, i'm off to play Skyrim for a little bit. Then book and bed."
28-11-2018T14:46:37,CrimsonQuill,Pray I don't get hit by a giant.
28-11-2018T14:47:23,Twokinds,Good luck!

28-11-2018T15:06:46,TerraTheWizard,"so many choices, can't pick which to vote on :ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake:"
28-11-2018T15:08:14,Mippy,"I know righ, all I know is I definitely want sad Trace. Rose‚Äôs childhood is also a contender"
28-11-2018T15:09:21,TerraTheWizard,"like, i have to vote for my one, but then what other choices :ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:"
28-11-2018T15:09:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Got a good chance what all‚Äôs gonna be popular. Likely gonna be some ties
28-11-2018T15:12:29,TerraTheWizard,"ok, think i've decided on what to vote for...."
28-11-2018T15:13:57,Mippy,Fish and chips for lunch. Yum Yum
28-11-2018T15:14:00,CrimsonQuill,"Of course, I'm going with my suggestion-why not? But others too will be favoured."
28-11-2018T15:14:12,CrimsonQuill,Fish and chips...been a long time since I had that.
28-11-2018T15:15:07,Mippy,I‚Äôve been waiting all week for fish and chips day at the school
28-11-2018T15:16:43,CrimsonQuill,"Anyone find it odd that not all these sketches are out yet, and that the Sunday Stream Sketches are only now coming out?"
28-11-2018T15:18:00,Mippy,"No, Tom explains why. He had extras."
28-11-2018T15:18:13,CrimsonQuill,I didn't see that.
28-11-2018T15:18:16,CrimsonQuill,Hmmm...
28-11-2018T15:19:44,Xexanoth,i just hope one of the sam&Colin ones gets colored
28-11-2018T15:20:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Colin is a good :ctwokinds-awoo:
28-11-2018T15:20:20,SpazztasticKiwi,So plush
28-11-2018T15:21:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve been trying to convince myself to get up and make food for the past 10 minutes
28-11-2018T15:21:05,CrimsonQuill,"A living pillow, is Colin"
28-11-2018T15:21:26,CrimsonQuill,@SpazztasticKiwi that was me before I finally got myself curry for dinner.
28-11-2018T15:21:34,CrimsonQuill,"As in, the curry i cooked."
28-11-2018T15:23:09,Xexanoth,"the sam and colin watch TV one would be great, but alas i don't have a vote... curse you money"
28-11-2018T15:23:17,Xexanoth,"or rather, lack of money"
28-11-2018T15:32:47,Mippy,I always make sure I have money for Tom :ctwokinds-adiracoin:
28-11-2018T15:39:17,Mippy,"Yup, gotta pay that man $10 a month for the privilege of not having my suggestions drawn. :ctwokinds-NataniHAHA: Love ya Tom!"

28-11-2018T15:39:46,CrimsonQuill,"But, oh boy, is it worth it when they are!"
28-11-2018T15:40:08,CrimsonQuill,"Case in point-my favourite halfkind, encased in 500kg Mjolnir armour!"
28-11-2018T15:40:25,CrimsonQuill,As pictured by our resident Drawing God.
28-11-2018T15:40:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I got one and a half done
28-11-2018T15:40:55,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-katdryer:
28-11-2018T15:41:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to figure that‚Äôs enough for me
28-11-2018T15:41:07,Xexanoth,step 1: get better suggestion /s
28-11-2018T15:41:33,Mippy,"Yeah, congrats on that Crimson. I‚Äôm still waiting for the day i get my first one. I‚Äôll probably startle my house mates with my fangirling"
28-11-2018T15:41:33,CrimsonQuill,"Yeah, my next suggestion'll be something that isn't a crossover."
28-11-2018T15:41:45,CrimsonQuill,@Mippy You'll get there.
28-11-2018T15:42:14,Mippy,(Still waiting for my print though) (grumble)
28-11-2018T15:42:27,CrimsonQuill,"As for fan reacting, it was 2 in the morning when i realised that it was indeed Raine in Halo armor, and I had to stop myself from waking everyone up with thankyous."
28-11-2018T15:43:05,Mippy,I‚Äôm more of a sqeeeing at the top of my lungs type
28-11-2018T15:43:47,Xexanoth,"yeah, crossovers rarely works...(he says as if he doesn't have one in his suggestion pile)"
28-11-2018T15:44:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm either a ‚Äúdo nothing but stare‚Äù type or ‚Äúaccidental R2D2 noise‚Äù type
28-11-2018T15:45:03,Dadrobit,D: My Book Club sketch isn't an option!
28-11-2018T15:45:05,CrimsonQuill,"Well, my idea evolved from a whole Halo Fireteam with Twokinds characters (That's about 4-5 Spartans) to just Raine and AI Red."
28-11-2018T15:45:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Not much in between
28-11-2018T15:45:36,CrimsonQuill,I find it funny that TOm became a little 'creative' with AI Red's gender...
28-11-2018T15:45:54,CrimsonQuill,I already have a full backstory in my head for when the picture is posted.
28-11-2018T15:46:24,TerraTheWizard,was going to check my stats page to see how many of my suggestions have been drawn
28-11-2018T15:46:41,TerraTheWizard,but it;s on my external hdd & i can't be bothered to reach behind me & grab it
28-11-2018T15:46:45,Dadrobit,"And with my votes in, I'm off again!"
28-11-2018T15:46:54,CrimsonQuill,Cheerio Dadrobit!
28-11-2018T15:46:55,Xexanoth,i'm at 0/0 so technically Tom has drawn 100% of my suggestions XD
28-11-2018T15:47:27,Xexanoth,:ptv-sneakysmirk:
28-11-2018T15:47:38,Dadrobit,"Spent the last 4 hours scouring Phoenix for tools and materials to fetch for pops, and now I'm back out for more fetching."
28-11-2018T15:47:52,TerraTheWizard,"heck it, ima check the stats file"
28-11-2018T15:48:08,CrimsonQuill,I have a flask of Camomile Tea.
28-11-2018T15:48:12,Mippy,And what do you mean ‚Äúbetter suggestions‚Äù . Who doesn‚Äôt wand Basitin butt?
28-11-2018T15:48:23,CrimsonQuill,Ummm...I don't really.
28-11-2018T15:48:33,Mippy,Ummm ....I just had a Diet Pepsi
28-11-2018T15:48:33,Xexanoth,apparently not enough people
28-11-2018T15:48:36,CrimsonQuill,I'd rather have a mage battle of some sort.
28-11-2018T15:48:39,SpazztasticKiwi,All y‚Äôall better be jealous
28-11-2018T15:48:42,Xexanoth,i go for cuteness
28-11-2018T15:48:44,Xexanoth,and cuddles
28-11-2018T15:48:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I got waffles
28-11-2018T15:48:50,CrimsonQuill,So? I had curry.
28-11-2018T15:48:51,Xexanoth,or bellyrubs
28-11-2018T15:48:54,CrimsonQuill,GREEN curry
28-11-2018T15:49:06,Mippy,Fish and Chips!
28-11-2018T15:49:11,CrimsonQuill,@Xenanoth Hot chocolate and Cosy scenes are my thing.
28-11-2018T15:49:30,TerraTheWizard,so according to my stats i'm up to 4.33 suggestions drawn
28-11-2018T15:49:37,CrimsonQuill,Ok
28-11-2018T15:49:41,TerraTheWizard,the .33 being from the 3 way share on the pirate zen sketch
28-11-2018T15:49:42,CrimsonQuill,WHat does that mean?
28-11-2018T15:49:46,CrimsonQuill,Oh
28-11-2018T15:50:17,Mippy,"Oh well, I‚Äôm going Holiday next month. Anyone want Keith posing nude in a Santa hat?"
28-11-2018T15:50:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe the sugar will make the headache ‚Äúshoo‚Äù as Tom put it
28-11-2018T15:50:57,CrimsonQuill,"@SpazztasticKiwi Careful you don't get a sugar rush, mate,"
28-11-2018T15:50:59,TerraTheWizard,"current most suggestions sketched winner is unsteddy, with 15.5"
28-11-2018T15:51:04,SpazztasticKiwi,..all I saw immediately was ‚Äúnude in a Santa hat‚Äù
28-11-2018T15:51:23,Mippy,XD
28-11-2018T15:51:33,CrimsonQuill,How's about Flora as a racecar driver?
28-11-2018T15:51:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean
28-11-2018T15:51:36,CrimsonQuill,Or a sniper
28-11-2018T15:51:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I was all for it
28-11-2018T15:51:46,SpazztasticKiwi,But I needed other context too
28-11-2018T15:52:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Flora as a sniper...
28-11-2018T15:52:04,CrimsonQuill,Yeah.
28-11-2018T15:52:12,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúIs THIS how you point it?‚Äù
28-11-2018T15:52:13,CrimsonQuill,In full Royal Marines kit and everything
28-11-2018T15:52:16,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúNO‚Äù
28-11-2018T15:52:25,CrimsonQuill,Crosshair trained on a target.
28-11-2018T15:52:29,Mippy,"Naw, I‚Äôve got a non nude suggestion for holidays"
28-11-2018T15:52:43,MrMongMong,Is it Basitans?
28-11-2018T15:52:55,CrimsonQuill,I'm typing this whilst listening to the Deja Vu song. Cue my endless headbanging.
28-11-2018T15:53:00,Mippy,Would it be anything else Mong?
28-11-2018T15:53:46,TerraTheWizard,kamaro12 is 2nd with 12.5 suggestions sketched
28-11-2018T15:53:51,CrimsonQuill,Good music always makes me move to the tune.
28-11-2018T15:53:52,TerraTheWizard,dadro is 3rd with 10
28-11-2018T15:53:58,CrimsonQuill,Wo's 4th?

28-11-2018T15:54:13,TerraTheWizard,9
28-11-2018T15:54:16,Mippy,I want to revisit the AU where Adelaide adopted Zen and Nat
28-11-2018T15:54:23,CrimsonQuill,"What place am I, given I have one sketch?"
28-11-2018T15:54:28,TerraTheWizard,"oh, werekeidran also has 9"
28-11-2018T15:54:39,TerraTheWizard,and menke
28-11-2018T15:55:25,TerraTheWizard,is your patreon name the same as your picarto name?
28-11-2018T15:55:30,CrimsonQuill,yep
28-11-2018T15:55:46,CrimsonQuill,"Actually, how do I look up stats?"
28-11-2018T15:56:16,TerraTheWizard,"ok, so because it's not been posted yet, 0"
28-11-2018T15:56:22,CrimsonQuill,ok
28-11-2018T15:56:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Can cats have waffles? Asking for a (very hungry) friend
28-11-2018T15:56:41,CrimsonQuill,No.
28-11-2018T15:57:12,CrimsonQuill,"Then again, technically they can't have my aunt's steak because that was for dinner. That didn't stop one from trying."
28-11-2018T15:57:25,TerraTheWizard,i should really convert this stats file to a spreadsheet
28-11-2018T15:57:47,TerraTheWizard,because currently it's an awkward .txt
28-11-2018T15:58:04,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I'm off. I've got a long chapter of TK to read, and a flask full of tea to drink."
28-11-2018T15:58:08,CrimsonQuill,Goodnight!

28-11-2018T16:05:05,Twokinds,Seems like a lot of work!
28-11-2018T16:05:14,Twokinds,That's so many sketches.
28-11-2018T16:05:42,TerraTheWizard,"this was how i found those 4 sketches that were missing the tags, lol"
28-11-2018T16:05:58,Twokinds,Aaaah makes sense
28-11-2018T16:06:13,TerraTheWizard,but man i really should convert this to a spreadsheet
28-11-2018T16:06:30,TerraTheWizard,so shared sketches get tallied better
28-11-2018T16:06:44,TerraTheWizard,"rather than just adding to a ""total wins"" sum"
28-11-2018T16:07:12,iliar,Hm I must have at least two color winners
28-11-2018T16:07:16,TerraTheWizard,because some of those people have had like 5 shared ones that have added up to full numbers
28-11-2018T16:09:07,SpazztasticKiwi,What about the .5 for me and that other guy with the Nibbly/Sythe sketch
28-11-2018T16:10:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"And how does the Nora cards factor into color vote tallies? Like if ‚ÄúA‚Äù carded ‚ÄúB‚Äôs‚Äù sketch to be colored, how would that be tallied?"
28-11-2018T16:10:52,TerraTheWizard,nora cards score for the sponsor only
28-11-2018T16:11:39,TerraTheWizard,"if/when i make the spreadsheet i'll make more stats for ""got carded"""
28-11-2018T16:12:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Sounds like a club bouncer‚Äôs favorite line
28-11-2018T16:12:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Bad joke

28-11-2018T16:36:39,Xexanoth,nerds? pfff next thing you're gonna say we're furries

28-11-2018T16:44:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd never
28-11-2018T16:45:06,Twokinds,Yeah! Ridiculous!
28-11-2018T16:45:49,Dadrobit,"Hm, I did my spreadsheet differently. I just gave out an extra point to both owners of sketches when they're shared."
28-11-2018T16:47:15,Dadrobit,"Unsteddy has 18 by my count, and I have 11. Third is a 4 way tie between myself, amenon, Foxpie, and Kamaro12."
28-11-2018T16:47:37,Dadrobit,Second is SomeOtherTom at 12.
28-11-2018T16:48:06,Dadrobit,"Also, I need to update my list, it hasn't been updated in maybe 2-3 weeks, so some names might change around."
28-11-2018T16:58:25,Bgrmystr2,"aw, Quill left already"
28-11-2018T16:58:29,Bgrmystr2,feelsbad
28-11-2018T16:58:44,Bgrmystr2,gmornin guys
28-11-2018T16:59:03,TerraTheWizard,hey bgr
28-11-2018T16:59:09,Bgrmystr2,"he called Raine a halfkind which isn't true, but eh, can't fix it now. he just ran off"
28-11-2018T16:59:15,SpazztasticKiwi,All this sketch tracking
28-11-2018T16:59:19,SpazztasticKiwi,So much math
28-11-2018T16:59:31,Bgrmystr2,an hour ago..
28-11-2018T16:59:41,Bgrmystr2,also yeah I rather prefer dadro's approach myself
28-11-2018T17:00:02,Bgrmystr2,cuz it makes more sense to add each person's name to the suggestion when it was shared
28-11-2018T17:00:23,Dadrobit,"Okay, updated. Second Place is now tied between Kam and SOT after SOT got The Assasin Sisters."
28-11-2018T17:00:24,Bgrmystr2,"cuz if you don't, that's not including every suggestor or every image"
28-11-2018T17:00:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Would these tallies include times if/when one of us did an in-person sketch
28-11-2018T17:00:53,Dadrobit,Unsteddy is still absurdly far ahead.
28-11-2018T17:01:13,Dadrobit,"No, I'm only counting sketches on Patreon"
28-11-2018T17:01:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Though not sure what impact that number would be
28-11-2018T17:02:03,Bgrmystr2,"what do you mean in-person sketch, kiwi?"
28-11-2018T17:02:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Like if Dadro met tom at a con and commissioned a sketch there
28-11-2018T17:02:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Why does autocorrect sometimes not decide to capitalize Tom?
28-11-2018T17:04:30,RimaDraws,hii
28-11-2018T17:04:37,Dadrobit,o/ Rima

28-11-2018T17:05:33,Dadrobit,Going through tallying everyone and their erspective sketches.
28-11-2018T17:06:21,RimaDraws,oh fun
28-11-2018T17:06:27,RimaDraws,i dont feel well
28-11-2018T17:07:20,Bgrmystr2,"but those aren't sunday sketches, kiwi"
28-11-2018T17:07:35,Bgrmystr2,that only applies to people who can afford to go to the conventions
28-11-2018T17:07:47,Dadrobit,"I have access to around 70 con sketches, but almost none of them have names attatched."
28-11-2018T17:09:13,Dadrobit,"Like, I know Tamer has a few, and a couple are Mihari, but most all of them are just signed by Tom and dated."
28-11-2018T17:09:20,SpazztasticKiwi,And I thought I had an obsession to meet people
28-11-2018T17:10:10,Dadrobit,"Also, sorry to hear that Rima"
28-11-2018T17:22:55,ThingsAreMoving,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce: o/ everyone!

28-11-2018T17:23:43,Dadrobit,o/
28-11-2018T17:24:31,RimaDraws,now work is mad cause i left to go home when i didn't feel well so they said no more overtime for a while
28-11-2018T17:27:30,ThingsAreMoving,I mean... if your health is not good enough for normal work then it's logical to not let you overwork yourself.
28-11-2018T17:28:28,ThingsAreMoving,"what kind of work are you doing, anyway?"
28-11-2018T17:29:18,RimaDraws,i mean i literally felt i could puke because of my period or something i ate. and i work at jack daniels where we bottle the stuff
28-11-2018T17:29:41,RimaDraws,its prety much anything from packaging to bottling or doing pour up something
28-11-2018T17:31:41,ThingsAreMoving,"yeah, you don't want to puke in an environment like that"
28-11-2018T17:32:10,ThingsAreMoving,food/drink industry has looooots of safety rules about contamination
28-11-2018T17:32:31,RimaDraws,well its like they think i totally planned to be sick
28-11-2018T17:32:35,RimaDraws,which i didnt
28-11-2018T17:33:11,ThingsAreMoving,that's a shitty attitude and could be interpreted as mobbing
28-11-2018T17:34:01,RimaDraws,mhmm
28-11-2018T17:34:07,Bgrmystr2,mobbing...? Like.. everyone getting together and beating someone?
28-11-2018T17:34:07,ThingsAreMoving,"but like I said, I'd cut your overtime to let you get back to your 100%  too"
28-11-2018T17:34:12,Bgrmystr2,not sure that's the right term.
28-11-2018T17:34:23,ThingsAreMoving,it is
28-11-2018T17:34:45,Bgrmystr2,"well, I'd say it isn't, but okay. xD"
28-11-2018T17:34:52,RimaDraws,she was like well we dont want you to do anymore overtime for a while
28-11-2018T17:35:12,Bgrmystr2,"you're probably overworking, Rima"
28-11-2018T17:35:33,RimaDraws,well i need the money after my $200 was stolen but how can i work sick
28-11-2018T17:36:22,Bgrmystr2,"a lot of times, sickness is just stress"
28-11-2018T17:36:26,Bgrmystr2,physically and mentally.
28-11-2018T17:36:52,RimaDraws,yea ive been stressed out over getting my bills paid
28-11-2018T17:36:52,ThingsAreMoving,can confirm
28-11-2018T17:38:00,ThingsAreMoving,can you borrow the money from someone and pay it back in installments when you get back on your feet?
28-11-2018T17:38:16,RimaDraws,i dont like asking my grandparents or my dad even if they offered
28-11-2018T17:39:14,RimaDraws,this is why ive been taking commissions or working when i can
28-11-2018T17:39:20,ThingsAreMoving,"well it's up to you, but think if stressing over it is worth more than just letting other people help you"
28-11-2018T17:41:27,RimaDraws,i know thanks...
