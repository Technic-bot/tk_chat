19-02-2018T13:28:51,JaydenMozingo,Waiting for the day to end
19-02-2018T13:29:05,JaydenMozingo,wishes he could be outside in the rain.

19-02-2018T13:35:33,wolfspartan1,is there thunder too or just rain
19-02-2018T13:36:03,JaydenMozingo,A little thunder
19-02-2018T13:36:12,JaydenMozingo,It's very nice.
19-02-2018T13:36:45,TheBeckoner,I like rain as well. Very soothing.
19-02-2018T13:37:21,TheBeckoner,I however dislike rain after washing my truck.
19-02-2018T13:37:28,wolfspartan1,gaming when it rains is the best
19-02-2018T13:37:34,JaydenMozingo,I know right? It's the only time I like to go outside.
19-02-2018T13:37:45,JaydenMozingo,Lol
19-02-2018T13:37:58,JaydenMozingo,yeah
19-02-2018T13:38:13,JaydenMozingo,Metroid prime is amazing in rain
19-02-2018T13:38:34,JaydenMozingo,What kind of truck do you have? Ram?
19-02-2018T13:38:53,JaydenMozingo,Chevy?
19-02-2018T13:39:20,TheBeckoner,An 05 Tacoma
19-02-2018T13:39:26,TheBeckoner,and a 99
19-02-2018T13:39:27,wolfspartan1,i like to play halo 3 odst while it rains
19-02-2018T13:39:48,JaydenMozingo,Nice
19-02-2018T13:40:13,TheBeckoner,You got a car?
19-02-2018T13:40:21,JaydenMozingo,Heh. no
19-02-2018T13:40:37,JaydenMozingo,lol
19-02-2018T13:41:28,JaydenMozingo,"When I do get one though, it'll probably be a Ram 2500"
19-02-2018T13:41:48,TheBeckoner,Beware of the transmissions. Unless you get a manual.
19-02-2018T13:42:07,TheBeckoner,Also pre 2006 if you want a diesel.
19-02-2018T13:42:15,JaydenMozingo,I'm a manual person
19-02-2018T13:42:17,TheBeckoner,No emissions then.
19-02-2018T13:42:33,TheBeckoner,I like auto's for commuting.
19-02-2018T13:42:37,JaydenMozingo,I drove my da's Dodge Charger
19-02-2018T13:42:43,JaydenMozingo,4 door
19-02-2018T13:42:54,JaydenMozingo,It was smooth
19-02-2018T13:43:17,JaydenMozingo,Automatic though. so meh
19-02-2018T13:43:41,TheBeckoner,The only chrysler I've had was a 2004 Jeep grand cherokee.  AWD and would get off the line great. very smooth ride.
19-02-2018T13:44:15,wolfspartan1,my dream car would be a green and black grand torino
19-02-2018T13:44:26,TheBeckoner,Ah the Torino is cool.
19-02-2018T13:44:56,JaydenMozingo,Very nice
19-02-2018T13:44:57,TheBeckoner,What year?
19-02-2018T13:45:09,wolfspartan1,72
19-02-2018T13:45:24,TheBeckoner,Nice.
19-02-2018T13:46:00,JaydenMozingo,"Even IF I ever had enough money, I would NEVER buy a Lamborghini."
19-02-2018T13:46:06,TheBeckoner,Here's a neat ad for the Torino I came across.  https://sammontana.deviantart.com/art/Ford-Torino-Cobra-70-Ad-168046845
19-02-2018T13:46:19,wolfspartan1,i would drive it all over and if anyone dented or scratched the paint i would break there windows lol
19-02-2018T13:46:28,JaydenMozingo,"2 door, no trunk, nowhere to drive it fast without getting pulled over"
19-02-2018T13:46:57,JaydenMozingo,Damn thats a nice Torino
19-02-2018T13:47:27,wolfspartan1,if i was rich i would get a shelby
19-02-2018T13:47:30,JaydenMozingo,"Oh, and Supercars are police magnets most the time"
19-02-2018T13:47:40,TheBeckoner,True.
19-02-2018T13:48:21,JaydenMozingo,I'd get me a Cadillac SUV
19-02-2018T13:48:41,JaydenMozingo,"But otherwise, i need me a truck"
19-02-2018T13:48:45,TheBeckoner,If I was to drive an SUV it would be the porsche cayenne.
19-02-2018T13:48:46,TheBeckoner,In red
19-02-2018T13:48:49,JaydenMozingo,So Ram is my choice.
19-02-2018T13:49:03,wolfspartan1,52 ford trucks look nice
19-02-2018T13:49:27,JaydenMozingo,"Oh dang, thats a nice suv"
19-02-2018T13:49:48,JaydenMozingo,Porsche has nice vehicles
19-02-2018T13:50:29,TheBeckoner,If I could buy another small truck it would probably be the ZR2 colorado with the diesel.
19-02-2018T13:50:44,TheBeckoner,Assuming I had that much money for a Toy truck lol
19-02-2018T13:50:47,TheBeckoner,toy*
19-02-2018T13:51:20,JaydenMozingo,Yeet
19-02-2018T13:51:24,wolfspartan1,anyone fans of the comet
19-02-2018T13:52:12,JaydenMozingo,yes
19-02-2018T13:52:25,wolfspartan1,my dad had one long ago
19-02-2018T13:52:28,JaydenMozingo,The comet muscle is beautiful.
19-02-2018T13:52:55,wolfspartan1,i wanted to restore it but the body was too ate out
19-02-2018T13:53:30,TheBeckoner,What year?
19-02-2018T13:53:56,wolfspartan1,62 i think...
19-02-2018T13:56:01,TheBeckoner,Nice
19-02-2018T13:57:54,wolfspartan1,ty
19-02-2018T14:16:29,JaydenMozingo,I have to head off here
19-02-2018T14:16:32,JaydenMozingo,Cya guys
19-02-2018T14:16:55,wolfspartan1,cya jay
19-02-2018T15:11:02,SpazztasticKiwi,MORNING
19-02-2018T15:11:10,TheBeckoner,Hello.
19-02-2018T15:11:11,wolfspartan1,ello
19-02-2018T15:11:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Whatâ€™s happenin
19-02-2018T15:14:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Iâ€™m fighting with my contacts - they wonâ€™t come out of their pods
19-02-2018T15:17:14,wolfspartan1,playing morrowind and good luck with that
19-02-2018T15:18:08,MidnightBlue78,:ptv-greetings:
19-02-2018T15:18:15,SpazztasticKiwi,They slid out eventually. Iâ€™m makin pancakes ðŸ¥ž
19-02-2018T15:22:45,Twokinds,:ptv-dealwithit:
19-02-2018T15:23:12,wolfspartan1,ello tom how are you doing?
19-02-2018T15:23:22,Twokinds,Good
19-02-2018T15:23:30,Twokinds,Just contributed to my retirement fund.
19-02-2018T15:23:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Enjoy you day off yesterday?
19-02-2018T15:25:22,Twokinds,Yeah I suppose so
19-02-2018T15:26:06,wolfspartan1,is it warm where you are tom?
19-02-2018T15:36:17,TheBeckoner,Is it Tom where you are Tom?
19-02-2018T15:57:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Think he died in the last thirty minutes
19-02-2018T15:57:35,SpazztasticKiwi,But I finished my breakfast
19-02-2018T15:57:48,wolfspartan1,rip tom
19-02-2018T16:03:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Weather says Cincinnati is 80 right now
19-02-2018T16:04:43,wolfspartan1,man its 84 inside my house
19-02-2018T16:05:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I donâ€™t think Tom is one to go outside and frolick in the sunshine
19-02-2018T16:08:00,wolfspartan1,what is this outside world you speak of?
19-02-2018T16:08:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Itâ€™s about the same temperature for me and Iâ€™m trying not to move too far from my fan
19-02-2018T16:09:25,wolfspartan1,i know i will miss this heat when its in the 40s again lol
19-02-2018T16:10:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"40s? Dude our winter gets so bad, Iâ€™d say screw it but itâ€™s definitely under 18"
19-02-2018T16:11:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Though thatâ€™s mainly nights - days tend to stay around 32
19-02-2018T16:14:45,wolfspartan1,i hate winter
19-02-2018T16:17:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Iâ€™m not a fan of it either but Iâ€™ve found advantages that have made me lean more towards moving somewhere colder
19-02-2018T16:17:48,SpazztasticKiwi,No wasps and thereâ€™s less of an expectation for you to spend time out
19-02-2018T16:40:51,Bgrmystr2,"Completely the opposite for me, Kiwi"
19-02-2018T16:41:01,Bgrmystr2,I can deal with the heat.
19-02-2018T16:41:39,Bgrmystr2,"your body has natural effects to deal with the heat, sweating being one of them"
19-02-2018T16:41:50,Bgrmystr2,but it doesn't have very many effects to deal with the cold
19-02-2018T16:42:03,Bgrmystr2,tis why we have to wear so many layers of clothes to make up for it
19-02-2018T16:53:55,TheBeckoner,Yup. that's what I tell people who favor the cold. We don't do well in it. We naturally deal with heat very well via sweat and greater control over our lungs.
19-02-2018T18:38:20,Dadrobit,"It's really the exact oppsite though. We're warm blooded mammals, which means we naturally create our own heat and can thus deal with outside temperatures much lower than our body temp."
19-02-2018T18:38:56,Dadrobit,Sitting outside for an hour at a temperature that is 40 below body temp and we're fine.
19-02-2018T18:39:27,Dadrobit,Sitting outside for an hour at a temperature that is 20 above our body temp and we're dead.
19-02-2018T18:40:52,Dadrobit,Dealing with any temperature above 108-ish and you need to take precautions to prevent stuff like heat stroke.
19-02-2018T18:41:08,Dadrobit,"Because above that point, sweat just doesn't cut it."
19-02-2018T18:54:38,Bgrmystr2,40 below body temp and I'd be wearing several layers of clothes cuz it's so damned cold
19-02-2018T18:54:41,Bgrmystr2,"you're nuts, Dadro xD"
19-02-2018T18:56:28,Bgrmystr2,us being warm-blooded only lowers the average temperature that we find comfortable. It doesn't make it the exact opposite.
19-02-2018T18:56:29,unsteddyphoenix,Bgr what's your ideal temperature again?
19-02-2018T18:58:01,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-wondering: mm, I dunno? Between 70 and 80 depending on if I've spent a lot of time outside."
19-02-2018T18:58:23,JaydenMozingo,Hello everyone! :smile_cat:
19-02-2018T18:59:04,Bgrmystr2,hey Jay
19-02-2018T18:59:34,JaydenMozingo,What's up Bg?
19-02-2018T19:00:15,wolfspartan1,hi jay
19-02-2018T19:00:33,JaydenMozingo,Hello Wolf!
19-02-2018T19:00:38,Bgrmystr2,was just taking a break from messing with the NAM traffic simulator for SimCity 4
19-02-2018T19:00:41,JaydenMozingo,How are you?
19-02-2018T19:00:55,wolfspartan1,did you get to enjoy the rain?
19-02-2018T19:01:02,JaydenMozingo,Yes.
19-02-2018T19:01:20,JaydenMozingo,"In fact, school might be canceled tomorrow because of it!"
19-02-2018T19:01:35,JaydenMozingo,It's starting to freeze over.
19-02-2018T19:01:46,JaydenMozingo,Getting below the 20's again
19-02-2018T19:04:02,wolfspartan1,thats awesome
19-02-2018T19:08:48,JaydenMozingo,Anyone here ever play BeamNG Drive?
19-02-2018T19:18:42,Dadrobit,"That's the thing though, even at 80 degrees, that's 18-19 below body temp and the body lives with that differrence just fine clothes op. But the opposite direction puts you at 116 and suddenly you're dying without a good source of shade/wind chill/water."
19-02-2018T19:19:26,Dadrobit,"The body can pretty easily deal without cover down to 50 degrees, but you're actually just dead in the other way."
19-02-2018T19:20:42,Dadrobit,"You might feel chilly, but if you're moving around, your body will naturally generate the heat to keep you healthy."
19-02-2018T19:20:45,Bgrmystr2,"of course, because warm blooded. Like I said, that simply lowers the average temperature the body would find comfortable. It doesn't change anything beyond that. Body heat only does so much."
19-02-2018T19:21:16,Dadrobit,Sweat does far far less in maintaining a healthy temperature.\
19-02-2018T19:22:45,Bgrmystr2,body heat only makes the ideal temp around 60 to 70 or so. It doesn't change the fact that 10 degrees above is easier dealt with than 10 degrees below.
19-02-2018T19:23:32,Bgrmystr2,it just changes the comfortable temperature center point. It doesn't change anything else.
19-02-2018T19:23:36,Dadrobit,It's not though. 108 degrees is strraight up lethal if you don't take precautions.
19-02-2018T19:23:59,Bgrmystr2,10 degrees above 60 or 70 is not 108 lol
19-02-2018T19:24:03,Dadrobit,Your brain cells start to die from external heat penetrating your skull
19-02-2018T19:24:52,Dadrobit,I'm talking body temp. Your health is based off of your ability to maintain a constant 98-ish degrees.
19-02-2018T19:25:19,Dadrobit,And that is far more easily maintained adapting from cold to hot and not the other way around.
19-02-2018T19:27:25,Bgrmystr2,"I would argue the opposite, as I can't wake up a single day without my arms and hands being at whatever temp the room is"
19-02-2018T19:27:39,Bgrmystr2,legs to a lesser extent
19-02-2018T19:27:58,Bgrmystr2,Wake up cold as fuck in a room that's 70
19-02-2018T19:28:09,Dadrobit,Eat more
19-02-2018T19:28:12,Bgrmystr2,I do eat
19-02-2018T19:28:17,Dadrobit,More
19-02-2018T19:28:27,Bgrmystr2,you want me to be fat? :thinking:
19-02-2018T19:28:45,Dadrobit,Or less if you have so /much/ fat that blood isn't reaching your outer ayer
19-02-2018T19:28:52,Dadrobit,layer*
19-02-2018T19:29:06,Bgrmystr2,I'm not fat at all bro lol
19-02-2018T19:29:38,Dadrobit,Sedintary lifestyle?
19-02-2018T19:29:41,Bgrmystr2,5'7 like 180lbs
19-02-2018T19:30:16,Bgrmystr2,"been this weight since I was like 18 or 20, and that was what, 10-12 years ago?"
19-02-2018T19:30:59,Bgrmystr2,"also, I dunno how you mean"
19-02-2018T19:31:31,Dadrobit,"Do you sit around all day, not doing much, not working out/hiking//being generally active?"
19-02-2018T19:32:05,Dadrobit,Folks who live sedintary lives tend to have shit resistances to the weather in general.
19-02-2018T19:32:15,Dadrobit,"Been there, done that."
19-02-2018T19:33:25,Dadrobit,Healthy diet/lifestyle makes a good healhty body more capable of maintaining itself.
19-02-2018T19:33:29,Bgrmystr2,"I work inside the house, yeah. Not always sitting, no, but I'm not outside considering the air is always wet and sticks to you whether it's hot or cold"
19-02-2018T19:34:29,Bgrmystr2,Computer components are not a fan of moisture in the air
19-02-2018T19:34:33,Dadrobit,But still hot weather will always kill you regardless of health. Chilly weather will just make you feel uncomfortable.
19-02-2018T19:34:53,Bgrmystr2,I've seen people call 50F hot
19-02-2018T19:35:06,Bgrmystr2,and you can survive 90F
19-02-2018T19:35:17,Dadrobit,And yet they don't die at 60 70 or 80.
19-02-2018T19:35:29,Dadrobit,"So it's not really hot, they're just pansies."
19-02-2018T19:35:29,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, funny how body heat works"
19-02-2018T19:35:48,Bgrmystr2,but 40 30 and 20? Below 50?
19-02-2018T19:35:54,Bgrmystr2,yeah people die
19-02-2018T19:36:03,Bgrmystr2,cuz the cold is brutal
19-02-2018T19:36:21,Dadrobit,We're fine down to those temps as well with activity.
19-02-2018T19:36:41,Dadrobit,"Our body is naturally more resistant to cold, period."
19-02-2018T19:37:04,Dadrobit,Cold being defined as less than body temp.
19-02-2018T19:37:12,Bgrmystr2,body temp is not a catch-all
19-02-2018T19:37:18,Bgrmystr2,it doesn't work that way
19-02-2018T19:37:50,Dadrobit,"It is the most important factor. If it goes too low or too high by even a little bit, we die."
19-02-2018T19:38:05,Dadrobit,And we deal with going too low far far better.
19-02-2018T19:40:34,Dadrobit,"""(the body)it doesn't have very many effects to deal with the cold"" is just not true. The default state of being alive is exceptionally good at defeating the cold."
19-02-2018T19:41:17,Bgrmystr2,Body heat is base. It's not an effect.
19-02-2018T19:41:25,Bgrmystr2,Sweat affects body heat.
19-02-2018T19:41:28,Dadrobit,"brb, tacos arrived."
19-02-2018T19:42:24,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: Everywhere I've lived has been the exact opposite of what you're saying, but I've always lived in the south, on the GA coast or LA coast, where it's hot and wet or cold and wet."
19-02-2018T19:43:00,Bgrmystr2,the heat and cold sticks to your skin and doesn't play nice at all
19-02-2018T19:43:34,Bgrmystr2,and hot/wet &gt; Cold/wet
19-02-2018T19:44:32,Bgrmystr2,"visiting Boston, it was just sheer cold. Can probably get away with gym and extra clothing"
19-02-2018T19:44:48,Bgrmystr2,because metabolism
19-02-2018T19:45:44,Bgrmystr2,would never want to live anywhere that's cold temp and wet all the time to boot.
19-02-2018T19:46:40,Dadrobit,Sister is here with tacos for B-Day. Gonna play some video games and partake in totally legal substances.
19-02-2018T19:48:06,Dadrobit,"But no, all you're talking about is ""comfort"" which is completely circumstancial based on the relative tolerance of the person."
19-02-2018T19:48:36,Dadrobit,"But when push comes to shove, the body /will/ tolerate cold more than it will heat."
19-02-2018T19:49:09,Dadrobit,"The person will bitch and complain if they're put in a cold place more, but they'll be alive."
19-02-2018T19:49:42,Dadrobit,Heat them up and they'll stop complaining in a few short hours.
19-02-2018T19:49:49,Dadrobit,Forever.
19-02-2018T19:50:47,Bgrmystr2,Heat is not something beyond circumstancial. There is no true baseline like you're tryin to say.
19-02-2018T19:51:23,Bgrmystr2,There's a reason humanity in largely gathers in warmer climates than colder ones.
19-02-2018T19:51:55,Bgrmystr2,humanity in general* my words are not with me today
19-02-2018T19:53:22,Bgrmystr2,"Though I guess if you're gonna start with an unfair baseline like 98.6 as external temp and then play with it from there, then obviously heat is a problem"
19-02-2018T19:53:29,Bgrmystr2,:u
19-02-2018T19:58:23,Dadrobit,Only in the last century with the advent of climate control systems have people started to gather in truly hot areas. Most of humanity has lived in areas that average temperatures colder than our own /because/ we deal with cold better than heat.
19-02-2018T19:58:56,Dadrobit,"And yes, heat is the problem, that's what I've been saying all along."
19-02-2018T19:59:22,Dadrobit,Your statement that we deal with heat better than cold is just objectively wrong.
19-02-2018T20:00:18,Bgrmystr2,You started with an unfair baseline to make a point about something that wouldn't be true if you actually bothered to have a fair baseline to begin with?
19-02-2018T20:00:50,Dadrobit,Because anything below it nearly down to the point of freezing is trivial.
19-02-2018T20:01:14,Dadrobit,We deal with all of it in stride.
19-02-2018T20:01:40,Bgrmystr2,"I guess if we were cold-blooded, you'd leave our base at the edge of freezing, yes?"
19-02-2018T20:01:46,Dadrobit,and the baseline of it being out body temp is important because it is literally our life
19-02-2018T20:01:53,Dadrobit,our*
19-02-2018T20:02:10,Bgrmystr2,such backwards lol
19-02-2018T20:02:41,Dadrobit,"We're not though, and it's not even remotey close to your original argumant"
19-02-2018T20:02:49,Dadrobit,argument*
19-02-2018T20:04:05,Bgrmystr2,"My point is that we deal with heat better than cold because our body heat is designed to protect against cold. The warmer it is, the less our body heat has to fight. The easier it is to survive."
19-02-2018T20:04:18,Bgrmystr2,"The colder it is, the more our body heat has to fight to survive, the worse off we are."
19-02-2018T20:04:27,Bgrmystr2,That is my point
19-02-2018T20:04:51,Dadrobit,"But the range of ""cold"" is Huuuuuuge compared to actual heat."
19-02-2018T20:05:13,Bgrmystr2,Warmth helps our body more than cold does because we naturally start in an environment that's colder than we are.
19-02-2018T20:05:20,Dadrobit,We objectively deal better all throuhgout cold than ew do with heat
19-02-2018T20:05:56,Bgrmystr2,"""Cold"" is not huge compared to heat. The only thing objective is what exactly is cold and hot."
19-02-2018T20:06:07,Dadrobit,"So what you're saying is that we naturally have a resistance to cold? Congratulations, you've just contradicted your original statement...."
19-02-2018T20:06:24,Bgrmystr2,"No, no I didn't. I'm saying you're not even looking at it the right way"
19-02-2018T20:06:51,Bgrmystr2,You're starting us from an environment that's the same as our body temp. Of course we would die if it got hotter.
19-02-2018T20:06:52,Bgrmystr2,Duh
19-02-2018T20:07:33,Dadrobit,The original statement from you was that we deal with cold worse than we deal with heat. You JUST stated that we're naturally built with warmth in mind to fend of temperatures that are naturally colder....
19-02-2018T20:07:59,Bgrmystr2,"Again, because the more heat we have in a cold environment, the less our body has to fight to survive."
19-02-2018T20:08:26,Dadrobit,Which contradicts your original statement.
19-02-2018T20:08:28,Dadrobit,"""your body has natural effects to deal with the heat, sweating being one of thembut it doesn't have very many effects to deal with the cold"""
19-02-2018T20:09:01,Dadrobit,"""Warmth helps our body more than cold does because we naturally start in an environment that's colder than we are."""
19-02-2018T20:09:12,Dadrobit,Literally just then
19-02-2018T20:09:13,Bgrmystr2,"It doesn't contradict it at all, did you even read what I said? Body heat is the BASE. It's not an effect."
19-02-2018T20:09:32,Dadrobit,"Yes, and anything less than body temperature is colder."
19-02-2018T20:09:37,Dadrobit,literally colder
19-02-2018T20:10:07,Dadrobit,"And it is naturally taken care of, by your own admission, by our naturally warm bodies"
19-02-2018T20:10:34,Bgrmystr2,"That's where you've fucked up your logic train then. Because if you're starting your ""base"" external temp at 98.6 for human survivability, we're all dead if it increases by 10 degrees simply because of bad comparisons."
19-02-2018T20:10:51,Bgrmystr2,Congratulations
19-02-2018T20:10:53,Dadrobit,But that's the fact of life.
19-02-2018T20:10:59,Bgrmystr2,"No, that's just a bad argument"
19-02-2018T20:11:18,Dadrobit,""" it doesn't have very many effects to deal with the cold"" is an asanine statement."
19-02-2018T20:11:37,Dadrobit,"One that you openly contradict, but refuse to admit you're wrong about"
19-02-2018T20:11:52,Bgrmystr2,"You haven't read anything I said, did you? xD"
19-02-2018T20:12:04,Dadrobit,Our base existance of being alive is the best resistance to cold
19-02-2018T20:12:09,Bgrmystr2,You're ignoring the fact that we're warm-blooded just to push a point that was pointless to begin with.
19-02-2018T20:12:36,Dadrobit,"The fact that we're warm blooded is my main argument, it was literally in my first sentance on this debate."
19-02-2018T20:12:45,Dadrobit,Have you read anything I'VE written?
19-02-2018T20:13:10,Bgrmystr2,"Yes, I have. And you're putting warm-blooded humans in an environment made for cold-blooded species."
19-02-2018T20:13:13,Dadrobit,"""It's really the exact oppsite though. We're warm blooded mammals, which means we naturally create our own heat"""
19-02-2018T20:15:24,Bgrmystr2,"We create our own heat to fight the cold, where we would live in naturally, which would be our natural environment, not the heat, but the cold, meaning the base of the environment is not equal to our body heat. Meaning heat is more ideal than cold."
19-02-2018T20:15:44,Dadrobit,"Environment had nothing to do with your statement, only that we are ill-equipped to deal with cold compared to heat."
19-02-2018T20:15:58,Bgrmystr2,because you're not looking at the big picture xD
19-02-2018T20:17:04,Bgrmystr2,We start in a cold environment naturally because we're warm-blooded. More heat will simply close the gap between the environment temperature and our body temperature
19-02-2018T20:17:16,Bgrmystr2,more cold will make it more difficult to survive.
19-02-2018T20:17:22,Dadrobit,So what you're saying is we're more equipped to deal with cold htan we are with heat. That's literally what you're saying.
19-02-2018T20:17:40,Bgrmystr2,"No, because that's irrelevant."
19-02-2018T20:17:53,Bgrmystr2,Because the cold is where we start.
19-02-2018T20:17:55,Dadrobit,Because we start in a cold environment and our bodies are equipped to deal with it.
19-02-2018T20:18:11,Dadrobit,It's literally hte entire premise of the argument
19-02-2018T20:18:13,Dadrobit,the*
19-02-2018T20:18:56,Bgrmystr2,"No it's not XD it has never had anything to do with that. The whole argument is the fact that we start in a cold environment, and we can deal with that environment getting warmer easier than we can deal with that environment getting colder."
19-02-2018T20:19:11,Bgrmystr2,It's because the environment is cold to begin with that cold is a worse factor than heat
19-02-2018T20:19:24,Bgrmystr2,you're not taking any of that into account whatsoever
19-02-2018T20:19:27,Bgrmystr2,when I already have.
19-02-2018T20:19:46,Dadrobit,You're actually just changing the topic. Your /original/ argument was that we are more equipped to deal with heat than we are with cold. That's it.
19-02-2018T20:19:57,Bgrmystr2,I haven't changed the topic at all
19-02-2018T20:21:02,Dadrobit,"When you say that me saying ""we are more equipped to deal with hot/cold"" is ""irrelevent"" in a debate on weather or not we're more equipped to deal with hot or cold, then you've changed the topic."
19-02-2018T20:21:16,Bgrmystr2,"I didn't expect you to just completely /ignore/ the fact that we, as warm-blooded mammals, naturally exist in a cold environment, and thus more heat makes our bodies fight less against the environment."
19-02-2018T20:21:17,Dadrobit,100%
19-02-2018T20:21:55,Dadrobit,And that is again contradictory to your original statement.
19-02-2018T20:23:10,Bgrmystr2,"No it fucking isn't because my statement that we don't have a lot to fight the cold is based on our actual environment in the cold weather as a BASE, not cold weather at being ""cold"" in general."
19-02-2018T20:23:12,Bgrmystr2,xD
19-02-2018T20:24:13,Bgrmystr2,"If you're gonna call anything below 98.6F cold, then there's no point using the term cold at all, because you're just using it as a catch-all"
19-02-2018T20:25:13,Dadrobit,"""cold"" being a subjective term that only serves to let people whine about something that isn't actually killing them because our bodies natural resisstance to cold is far and away better than our resistance to heat which will actually kill us very quickly"
19-02-2018T20:26:23,Bgrmystr2,Only in an environment that isn't suited for us.
19-02-2018T20:26:34,Bgrmystr2,which would break the entire thing to begin with
19-02-2018T20:29:18,Bgrmystr2,"Your starting point was never the same as mine. That's why we're not on the same page. You're trying to tell me something that I've already considered and included in my statements which look at a realistic perspective, not an experimental perspective"
19-02-2018T20:32:01,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: I guess it's still somehow going to be my fault for thinking the big picture was the whole point to begin with, when all I'm being told is one variable of it that doesn't change the end result."
19-02-2018T21:05:30,Dadrobit,Back for a second while my sister finishes decorating her sackboy.
19-02-2018T21:05:48,Dadrobit,You're in the wroing for changing your argument really.
19-02-2018T21:05:52,Dadrobit,wrong*
19-02-2018T21:06:41,Dadrobit,"You've gone from ""We are more equiped for dealing with heat"" to ""We aren't meant to live in areas that are too hot."""
19-02-2018T21:06:51,Bgrmystr2,"I never changed my argument to begin with, it's always been the same, I just had to expand and specify since you were simply pushing one single variable."
19-02-2018T21:07:14,Bgrmystr2,"If that's what you're getting out of it, then you're reading it wrong"
19-02-2018T21:09:22,Bgrmystr2,"It only looks like I changed it to you because you're only looking at what you want to see. You're trying to entice me to attempt to prove you wrong, and that was never my plan to begin with."
19-02-2018T21:09:25,Bgrmystr2,so it's not working
19-02-2018T21:10:01,Bgrmystr2,Because I realize that I'm not even looking at the same thing you are.
19-02-2018T21:10:06,Dadrobit,Except that /was/ your original argument. That we are more able to adapt to heat than we are cold. But then you say I shouldn't bring up areas that are too hot because we aren't suited for the heat.
19-02-2018T21:10:57,Bgrmystr2,You're still only looking at one variable
19-02-2018T21:11:15,Dadrobit,The only thing that is varying here is your arument mate.
19-02-2018T21:11:20,Dadrobit,argument*
19-02-2018T21:11:44,Bgrmystr2,"If you can't see the connection, then I think it's the lack in variation of your vision of the conversation that's the problem :P"
19-02-2018T21:12:25,Bgrmystr2,We're not even talking about the same thing. It took me a bit but I've already figured that out
19-02-2018T21:13:18,Dadrobit,"Bruh, hot and cold. It's not that hard. If the temperature is lower than our body temp, then it is colder. Objectively."
19-02-2018T21:14:28,Bgrmystr2,"If that's the only point you're trying to make, then fine. What I said, in context, has nothing to do with that."
19-02-2018T21:14:45,Dadrobit,"The topic is how well a body can survive in hot vs cold, and we are objectively better at living in colder temps"
19-02-2018T21:15:05,Bgrmystr2,But I guess it's my fault that I didn't put context to begin with since I didn't expect you to just ignore realistic standards completely
19-02-2018T21:15:57,Dadrobit,TIL: Life and death are not realistic standards for detirmining how good a body is at living.
19-02-2018T21:16:20,Bgrmystr2,Becuase you can't see anything beyond your own argument.
19-02-2018T21:17:00,Dadrobit,My argument being an objective take on the topic. As an argument shoulf be made.
19-02-2018T21:17:05,Dadrobit,should*
19-02-2018T21:17:09,Bgrmystr2,"If outside temperatures are colder than 98.6F, and that's the ONLY variable, then technically you're correct in that we survive better, and that's only because that's what our body is made to do."
19-02-2018T21:17:18,Bgrmystr2,Which is a pointless statement because I've already concluded that
19-02-2018T21:17:33,Bgrmystr2,and based on my statements on putting us in a cold environment
19-02-2018T21:17:38,Bgrmystr2,where heat is better than more cold
19-02-2018T21:18:04,Dadrobit,"Which means we are more equipped to deal with cold, which is contradictory to your original statement,"
19-02-2018T21:18:09,Bgrmystr2,No
19-02-2018T21:18:16,Bgrmystr2,You've missed the point entirely
19-02-2018T21:18:34,Dadrobit,"""We are better equipped to deal with heat than cold"""
19-02-2018T21:18:50,Dadrobit,You've lost sight of yur own point
19-02-2018T21:18:55,Dadrobit,your*
19-02-2018T21:19:02,Bgrmystr2,"In a COLD environment, which is NORMAL for us, we are BETTER equipped to deal with heat than more cold."
19-02-2018T21:19:14,Bgrmystr2,That is not illogical.
19-02-2018T21:19:37,Dadrobit,It is however completely tangential to your original statement.
19-02-2018T21:19:48,Bgrmystr2,That IS my original statement
19-02-2018T21:19:54,Bgrmystr2,you're just not bothering to look at everything
19-02-2018T21:20:06,Bgrmystr2,So I can't win
19-02-2018T21:20:11,Dadrobit,Correct
19-02-2018T21:20:32,Dadrobit,"Making blanket and incorrect statements like, ""we are more equipped to deal with heat"" you will not win"
19-02-2018T21:20:56,Bgrmystr2,I can't win because you're the only one making blanket statements here.
19-02-2018T21:21:05,Bgrmystr2,And then you're ignoring everything I've specified
19-02-2018T21:21:51,Bgrmystr2,"It's because you're ignoring everything that I can't win. Not because I'm wrong, but because you wont even accept that my statement exists."
19-02-2018T21:21:54,Bgrmystr2,You only see your own
19-02-2018T21:21:59,Bgrmystr2,"and everything else must be wrong,."
19-02-2018T21:22:13,Dadrobit,I'm just going off of your original ideology. You're the one coming up with tangential justifications that ironicall contradict it to try and salvage it.
19-02-2018T21:22:21,Dadrobit,ironically*
19-02-2018T21:23:41,Dadrobit,"""The body is not equipped to deal with the cold, but it naturally must exist in an environment that is colder than itself, therefore heat is more tolerable."""
19-02-2018T21:23:58,Bgrmystr2,"xD And this is why we can't have nice things Dadro. Because you won't bother actually looking at what I'm actually saying. I'm trying to explain what I meant by my statement, and you won't have any of it."
19-02-2018T21:24:04,Dadrobit,Is what your argument has amalgamated itself into
19-02-2018T21:24:39,Bgrmystr2,"No, that's only what you're trying to make it out to be"
19-02-2018T21:24:40,Dadrobit,Absolutely not! :D You must stand by one statement and One alone :)
19-02-2018T21:24:53,Bgrmystr2,"Then you've got no idea how arguments work, dadro."
19-02-2018T21:24:54,Bgrmystr2,xD
19-02-2018T21:25:07,Bgrmystr2,"or debates, in this case"
19-02-2018T21:25:20,Dadrobit,Changing your argument halfway through is not how you debate.
19-02-2018T21:25:29,Bgrmystr2,"unless you wanna call it the former, but I don't think it's that big of a thing"
19-02-2018T21:26:03,Bgrmystr2,"I never changed my argument at all, you're just using that as an excuse so you can ignore my giving context to why my I worded my original statement the way I did."
19-02-2018T21:26:22,Dadrobit,"Like, I'm pretty high right now. But I think even Snoop Dogg would have a hell of a time unravelling your web of contradictions and justifications."
19-02-2018T21:27:04,Bgrmystr2,"Dadro, I think you may have broken, and need a break xD"
19-02-2018T21:27:25,Dadrobit,The only thing I've broken is a taco shell thank you very much.
19-02-2018T21:27:42,Bgrmystr2,"Oh, yeah, you're right. You were already broken from the get-go. :D"
19-02-2018T21:28:07,Dadrobit,My 9 year broken anniverssary was just the other night \o/
19-02-2018T21:28:21,Bgrmystr2,Giving context to a base statement is not contradicting it. But I guess the word context is pointless :V
19-02-2018T21:28:37,Bgrmystr2,Because nothing I've said has been taken in context at all
19-02-2018T21:28:43,Bgrmystr2,it's all been taken as-is
19-02-2018T21:29:05,Dadrobit,"Don't need context. That which is hotter is hot, that which is colder is cold. EZPZ"
19-02-2018T21:29:06,Bgrmystr2,Guess I should have expected this too. :thinking:
19-02-2018T21:29:33,Dadrobit,"""Natural environment"" be damned."
19-02-2018T21:29:35,Bgrmystr2,"And that's why you can't figure out my statement, Dadro. Because you're ignoring context."
19-02-2018T21:30:11,Bgrmystr2,"If you're going to throw away the entire point of why I said what I said, then I don't really have anything else TO say XD"
19-02-2018T21:32:24,Dadrobit,Right on then. Back to LBP! :D
19-02-2018T21:32:49,Dadrobit,Im a terrible honst being on my phone like this.
19-02-2018T21:32:52,Dadrobit,host*
19-02-2018T21:33:49,Bgrmystr2,Don't let me stop you from being a good host. I ain't goin anywhere :V Go do the thing
19-02-2018T21:34:09,Bgrmystr2,I'll still be here when it's all done.
19-02-2018T21:37:10,zolstarym,"The human body continually generates heat that it must disperse, so if you put it in 37C environment then it wont be able to maintain that"
19-02-2018T21:39:29,Bgrmystr2,37C being a 98.6F environment? Yeah no kidding.
19-02-2018T21:44:46,zolstarym,so it would be able to withstand colder temperatures easier than warmer (relative to itself)?
19-02-2018T21:46:40,Bgrmystr2,Why would you start something in an environment that isn't suitable for it to begin with?
19-02-2018T21:47:04,Bgrmystr2,unrealistic and illogical
19-02-2018T21:48:47,zolstarym,then what is the starting point?
19-02-2018T21:49:37,Bgrmystr2,"That was Dadro's starting point. Which is pointless, because humans wouldn't naturally be living in an environment that's equal to it's body temperature."
19-02-2018T21:50:21,Bgrmystr2,"The starting point is where people actually live, in a colder than body temperature environment. Where the warmer you get, the less the body fights the environment to keep you warm."
19-02-2018T21:50:32,Bgrmystr2,"And the colder you get, the more the body fights"
19-02-2018T21:51:20,Bgrmystr2,"Humans don't all live in environments that are 98.6F, or 37C, so there's no point to start there."
19-02-2018T21:52:07,Bgrmystr2,"Starting in a colder climate, the warmer that climate is, the closer it is to body temperature, and the easier the body can deal."
19-02-2018T21:52:43,Bgrmystr2,"In an environment that's cold to begin with, getting colder will only worsen the problems."
19-02-2018T21:53:34,Bgrmystr2,"Why you would begin in an environment that's fated to kill you to begin with.. and then say ""But more heat would kill you!"" No shit, capt obvious XD"
19-02-2018T21:53:58,Bgrmystr2,But I guess I did not know that. :V
19-02-2018T21:54:18,Bgrmystr2,Which Dadro was happily attempting to tell me.
19-02-2018T21:56:06,Bgrmystr2,"Starting from a cold climate, which is the logical place for a warm-blooded species, the warmer it gets, the easier that species can deal with the temperature.. until it gets close to the internal body temperature"
19-02-2018T21:56:26,zolstarym,"The body has temperature regulation going both ways, from shivering to generate heat, to sweat glands allowing perspiration to cool the body"
19-02-2018T21:57:08,Bgrmystr2,that it does.
19-02-2018T21:57:49,zolstarym,but what is cold or hot is subjective
19-02-2018T21:57:53,Bgrmystr2,And there's way more it can do from it's starting point in a cold environment that gets closer to it's body temperature than it can when the temperature gets colder.
19-02-2018T21:58:40,Bgrmystr2,"Subjective, yes. Tis why Dadro and I couldn't see eye to eye. He was only basing it off body temp, not environment temp"
19-02-2018T21:59:07,Bgrmystr2,body temp means fuck all if you're in an environment that your body isn't designed to handle
19-02-2018T21:59:12,Bgrmystr2,:/
19-02-2018T22:00:25,Bgrmystr2,"Really, it's just an upwards and downwards perspective on the same stretch of temps between 0C and body temperature"
19-02-2018T22:00:59,Bgrmystr2,I start from the bottom because that's where we would naturally belong.
19-02-2018T22:01:39,Bgrmystr2,Even the therm starts at 0C
19-02-2018T22:06:10,Bgrmystr2,"I guess it's just what I call as ""warm"", being the suitable environment for humans above water freezing point / 0C, between like 10 and 25C or so, is the same as Dadro's ""cold"" temps being colder than body temp at like 37C or 98.6F"
19-02-2018T22:06:13,zolstarym,0 kelvin would be the true bottom.
19-02-2018T22:06:23,Bgrmystr2,Only nerds use Kelvin :V
19-02-2018T22:06:34,Bgrmystr2,but that is true
19-02-2018T22:06:53,Bgrmystr2,absolute zero lol
19-02-2018T22:07:08,zolstarym,stp has 25C as standard
19-02-2018T22:07:48,Bgrmystr2,standard for what :o
19-02-2018T22:07:57,Bgrmystr2,ideal living conditions?
19-02-2018T22:08:11,zolstarym,chemistry experiments mostly
19-02-2018T22:08:30,Bgrmystr2,xD Nerds! :ptv-sneakysmirk:
19-02-2018T22:08:42,zolstarym,"""standard temp and pressure"""
19-02-2018T22:08:44,Bgrmystr2,still cool tho
19-02-2018T22:09:01,Bgrmystr2,"they had to stick with something though, prolly didn't matter what"
19-02-2018T22:09:04,zolstarym,or stp for short
19-02-2018T22:09:46,Bgrmystr2,I dunno why but that makes me hungry :C
19-02-2018T23:34:56,Twokinds,:ptv-sneakysmirk:
19-02-2018T23:37:28,wolfspartan1,ello tom
19-02-2018T23:38:42,Twokinds,:ptv-dealwithit:
19-02-2018T23:40:01,wolfspartan1,how has your day been?
19-02-2018T23:40:15,Twokinds,Fantastic!
19-02-2018T23:40:46,Twokinds,How has your day been?
19-02-2018T23:42:16,wolfspartan1,alright for the most part. messed up a motherboard but they are cheap to replace
19-02-2018T23:55:21,unsteddyphoenix,What did you do Tom?
19-02-2018T23:55:34,unsteddyphoenix,Or was it fantastic 'cause you didnt have to do anything!
19-02-2018T23:56:01,Twokinds,"Well, I did my retirement filing."
19-02-2018T23:56:31,Twokinds,Feel pretty accomplished.
19-02-2018T23:56:47,Twokinds,Vol 4 almost done
19-02-2018T23:57:04,unsteddyphoenix,Wow such fun! :O
19-02-2018T23:57:31,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh nice, everyone done proofin?"
19-02-2018T23:57:48,Twokinds,Yeah I got all the proofing back
19-02-2018T23:57:51,Twokinds,"Thanks for that, btw!"
19-02-2018T23:58:16,unsteddyphoenix,No prob~
19-02-2018T23:58:23,unsteddyphoenix,Just hope I didnt miss anything
19-02-2018T23:58:44,unsteddyphoenix,Did you ever play Papers Please?
19-02-2018T23:58:47,unsteddyphoenix,Feel like you'd enjoy that one
19-02-2018T23:59:11,Twokinds,Yeah I have
