29-09-2018T18:02:43,Ordithus,Impromptu doggos?  Adorable
29-09-2018T18:08:22,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs this lady that‚Äôs rescued about 140ish dogs and cares for them 24/7 alone. Mark live-streamed with his mom and she showed the stream and Mark
29-09-2018T18:08:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark decided he‚Äôd take the superchat money sent to him and try donating it to her

29-09-2018T18:16:54,Ordithus,That could help pay for a lot of things.  It's incredible how much Mark can raise for charities
29-09-2018T18:17:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark‚Äôs got some great influence. And it does a lot when he puts it to use
29-09-2018T18:22:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"Not only that, he‚Äôs made himself enough of a man of his word that as far as leaders go, he‚Äôs one of the best models out there"
