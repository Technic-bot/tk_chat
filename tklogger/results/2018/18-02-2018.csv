18-02-2018T00:06:47,TheBeckoner,"Maybe. I still think this is a garbage chip. Probably a combination of: Crap chip, small cooler and haswell architecture."
18-02-2018T00:07:12,TheBeckoner,Because boiling water is absurd lol
18-02-2018T00:09:05,Ordithus,Stupid question: is the water cooler full?
18-02-2018T00:09:26,TheBeckoner,Good question. /t
18-02-2018T00:09:36,TheBeckoner,"It's sealed, I hope so lol"
18-02-2018T00:10:07,TheBeckoner,"I mean I guess it wouldn't hurt to pen it up, I have means of closing it again."
18-02-2018T00:10:12,TheBeckoner,open*
18-02-2018T00:10:46,Ordithus,Or you could try a standard air cooler
18-02-2018T00:10:58,Ordithus,Just to make sure it isn't your radiaotr
18-02-2018T00:11:35,TheBeckoner,"yeah. Probably something by noctua if I do. It's not really an issue, I just cant OC"
18-02-2018T00:11:51,Ordithus,Seeing as you already can't
18-02-2018T00:14:17,TheBeckoner,yup.
18-02-2018T00:14:49,TheBeckoner,So anybody doing anything worthwhile in here?
18-02-2018T00:15:39,BluePhantom90,hmm Tom you still alive -pokes Tom-
18-02-2018T00:17:49,Twokinds,no
18-02-2018T00:18:22,Bgrmystr2,rip
18-02-2018T00:19:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Taxes will do that to you
18-02-2018T00:19:17,TheBeckoner,Daaaaammmmn
18-02-2018T00:19:22,TheBeckoner,No more TK I guess
18-02-2018T00:19:30,Ordithus,Take some time off from life for tax reasons
18-02-2018T00:19:42,TheBeckoner,Also sucks that Tom died
18-02-2018T00:21:22,BluePhantom90,"lol alright well Night all. And Tom I do hope you take those three e-mails for consideration. Sucks when My unit just said ""Your contract is done, now get out"" and not even the 3 star to thank me for the 8 years of service"
18-02-2018T00:21:22,SpazztasticKiwi,We are gathered here today to celebrate the life of this man....
18-02-2018T00:21:45,Ordithus,night blue
18-02-2018T00:23:13,TheBeckoner,Night 90
18-02-2018T00:23:29,DarthRexKing,"Wait, what happened to blue? I will look back."
18-02-2018T00:25:05,unsteddyphoenix,"Ugh, he's still trying that huh..."
18-02-2018T00:25:12,unsteddyphoenix,How unpleasant.
18-02-2018T00:27:38,TheBeckoner,who tryin what?
18-02-2018T00:27:56,MidnightBlue78,i don't even know what happens here anymore :ptv-kippi:
18-02-2018T00:28:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Magic
18-02-2018T00:28:46,Bgrmystr2,"Basically, Blue's trying to buy commissions from tom cuz he (blue) just recently got out of the military."
18-02-2018T00:29:20,DarthRexKing,Hmm.
18-02-2018T00:29:21,Bgrmystr2,been trying for a couple months at least now
18-02-2018T00:29:42,Bgrmystr2,"it would be fine if tom accepted commissions, but doesn't do commissions"
18-02-2018T00:29:59,DarthRexKing,Ah.
18-02-2018T00:30:11,Bgrmystr2,"and blue was trying to get around that by using a sob story about the military treating him bad when he got discharged, etc"
18-02-2018T00:30:33,Bgrmystr2,"which sucks, if true, but has no relevance to tom not doing commissions simply because lack of time"
18-02-2018T00:31:01,DarthRexKing,interesting.
18-02-2018T00:31:05,TheBeckoner,^
18-02-2018T00:31:17,TheBeckoner,I assume he will be ignored?
18-02-2018T00:31:31,TheBeckoner,Also what's up Midnight?
18-02-2018T00:31:37,TheBeckoner,how yah do?
18-02-2018T00:32:30,Bgrmystr2,"Dunno beck. Not sure what Tom plans to do. But Blue is being kind of pushy and impaitent with it, so."
18-02-2018T00:33:40,Bgrmystr2,"I think it'd be nice if Tom could do it, but if he doesn't have time, he doesn't have time. I can't comment since I dunno."
18-02-2018T00:33:58,Bgrmystr2,but that's the story
18-02-2018T00:35:49,MidnightBlue78,@TheBeckoner nothing much
18-02-2018T00:35:53,TheBeckoner,"I don't blame Tom for not doing it. I used to do pixel art a while ago and when people made a request I found that it looked like garbage, but If I did it out of my own want, I like the art much better. Idk If Tom is that way. Just my experience."
18-02-2018T00:36:08,TheBeckoner,Not saying you do blame him Bgr.
18-02-2018T00:36:31,TheBeckoner,Not much can be good sometimes Crumbs.
18-02-2018T00:37:01,MidnightBlue78,I guess
18-02-2018T00:37:40,TheBeckoner,Spurs the neurons to fire and such.
18-02-2018T00:44:13,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs the reason I started making tiny paper flowers. They take time but their something I can focus on and generally like to do
18-02-2018T00:44:30,SpazztasticKiwi,*they‚Äôre
18-02-2018T00:46:16,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs also why my abilities are so scattered - I‚Äôll try alot but I won‚Äôt continue what I don‚Äôt like or find interesting
18-02-2018T00:46:23,TheBeckoner,Usually I'll do work or play a game. Maybe work on something mechanical.
18-02-2018T00:46:35,TheBeckoner,lol Me too Spazz
18-02-2018T00:46:49,TheBeckoner,Jack of all trades I believe is the term?
18-02-2018T00:47:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"Still can‚Äôt draw worth much, but I can do a ton of other stuff"
18-02-2018T00:49:24,TheBeckoner,My drawing on a scale of 1-10 is like
18-02-2018T00:49:27,TheBeckoner,2.3?
18-02-2018T00:49:31,TheBeckoner,2.5?
18-02-2018T00:49:36,TheBeckoner,somewhere in there
18-02-2018T00:50:00,TheBeckoner,"I can draw square stuff pretty good, like 4.3? maybe?"
18-02-2018T00:50:06,TheBeckoner,4.1?
18-02-2018T00:50:08,TheBeckoner,i dunno
18-02-2018T00:52:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"It depends on what I‚Äôm doing. Line art‚Äôs likely my best thing at maybe a 5, but everything else is pretty undeveloped"
18-02-2018T00:55:04,Ordithus,g'night
18-02-2018T00:55:11,Ordithus,:ptv-sleepy:
18-02-2018T00:56:21,TheBeckoner,Goodnight Ord. Slap whale.
18-02-2018T00:57:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"Nity nite üò¥ Thing is, I like art and creating but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs something I want to make my career, not completely. But I also like physiology and medicine"
18-02-2018T00:58:06,SpazztasticKiwi,So I have a question to what I really want to jump into
18-02-2018T00:58:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Because there‚Äôs also my interest in languages
18-02-2018T01:01:17,TheBeckoner,"I dunno man I think something sorta along those lines everyday. I want to have a business and sell fabricated parts. That's my goal so far, but I also enjoy making videos and art. I guess Since I like them all, whatever makes the most money wins."
18-02-2018T01:01:28,TheBeckoner,(Woman?)
18-02-2018T01:01:57,TheBeckoner,"but with 2.3 outta 10, art is losing lol"
18-02-2018T01:04:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm kinda there with you
18-02-2018T01:27:40,TheBeckoner,Welp Im callin it a night. I got classes tomorrow. Gnight pepples.
18-02-2018T01:38:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Night üí§
18-02-2018T01:39:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"If I tried going now, I wouldn‚Äôt sleep so my bed time‚Äôs still pending"
18-02-2018T01:43:32,SpazztasticKiwi,These people went to the theater to watch Black Panther and the theater started showing 50 Shades Freed instead ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
18-02-2018T01:43:50,unsteddyphoenix,?????
18-02-2018T01:45:04,Twokinds,?????
18-02-2018T01:45:43,SpazztasticKiwi,It took them ten minutes to realize they fecked up
18-02-2018T01:46:09,unsteddyphoenix,You're saying they literally started showing 50 shades by mistake?
18-02-2018T01:46:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Yep. Priceless
18-02-2018T01:46:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Talk about ‚Äúoops‚Äù
18-02-2018T01:46:57,unsteddyphoenix,How could that possibly happen
18-02-2018T01:47:03,unsteddyphoenix,How were the ensuing riots?
18-02-2018T01:48:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Who knows? The people were shown laughing at the whole thing; I think it‚Äôs because the theater switched back to the right movie after they realized something was wrong
18-02-2018T01:49:07,unsteddyphoenix,Someone did it on purpose
18-02-2018T01:49:19,unsteddyphoenix,I cant accept any other explanation
18-02-2018T01:49:40,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs nothing like the theater that was supposed to play the Smurfs movie and instead started airing (I think) Insidious instead
18-02-2018T01:49:52,SpazztasticKiwi,To a room of children
18-02-2018T01:50:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"Or maybe it wasn‚Äôt the Smurfs, but I know it was a kid‚Äôs movie"
18-02-2018T01:51:20,SpazztasticKiwi,But how do you mess up 50 Shades with Black Panther?
18-02-2018T01:51:54,unsteddyphoenix,Was it the same theater?
18-02-2018T01:52:23,Bgrmystr2,50 Shades of Panther?
18-02-2018T01:52:35,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. black is technically a shade.
18-02-2018T01:52:37,Bgrmystr2,Close enough? :V
18-02-2018T01:52:51,unsteddyphoenix,Are there even any black people in that movie
18-02-2018T01:52:58,unsteddyphoenix,Youd think it'd be a dead giveaway
18-02-2018T01:54:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Two separate theaters made a movie mess up
18-02-2018T01:54:53,unsteddyphoenix,It's a conspiracy...
18-02-2018T01:55:22,SpazztasticKiwi,And idk about any African Americans being in 50 Shades. I‚Äôve purposely avoided information about it
18-02-2018T01:55:50,unsteddyphoenix,Seems like a good call.
18-02-2018T01:56:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"If that Grey man, the main male character, wasn‚Äôt rich, the whole thing wouldn‚Äôt be as popular as it is. It would be an episode of Criminal Minds"
18-02-2018T01:56:41,unsteddyphoenix,I wanna see the movie where he's poor and ugly
18-02-2018T01:56:52,unsteddyphoenix,Would be interesting~
18-02-2018T01:57:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"What I‚Äôve seen is that is essentially an abusive relationship, with the lady staying because he‚Äôs hot and rich"
18-02-2018T01:58:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I know there are psychologists that disapprove of the story
18-02-2018T01:58:59,unsteddyphoenix,"'cause it glamorizes abuse, or something?"
18-02-2018T01:59:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"Pretty much. Thing is, have your kinks, but have some limits and boundaries too, and know the difference"
18-02-2018T02:00:49,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah you gotta have a conversation first, and establish each others limits"
18-02-2018T02:00:59,unsteddyphoenix,But I assume that doesnt translate too well into movie pacing~
18-02-2018T02:01:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚ÄúRelationship goals‚Äù is not what I‚Äôd call it, though that seems to be one of the trends around it"
18-02-2018T02:02:11,unsteddyphoenix,omg #goaals~
18-02-2018T02:02:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôd rather sit in and cook a dinner as a date, even if it‚Äôs home made pizza"
18-02-2018T02:02:41,unsteddyphoenix,That sounds pretty damn good
18-02-2018T02:03:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Co napping is a good couples goal too
18-02-2018T02:04:09,DarthRexKing,I am going to bed. Goodnight.
18-02-2018T02:04:15,unsteddyphoenix,Later.
18-02-2018T02:04:31,unsteddyphoenix,Like 70% if the reason I want a relationship is to cuddle.
18-02-2018T02:04:34,unsteddyphoenix,Big fan.
18-02-2018T02:04:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Later Darth
18-02-2018T02:04:59,DarthRexKing,Later.

18-02-2018T15:40:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Most people around here park it on the end of a driveway with a for sale sign on it

18-02-2018T15:42:26,wolfspartan1,not like they can ban me from xbox live

18-02-2018T15:54:22,wolfspartan1,they ended xbox live support on it in 2010
18-02-2018T16:01:53,SpazztasticKiwi,So you‚Äôre trying to get it back yourself?

18-02-2018T16:44:10,wolfspartan1,never saw black panther
