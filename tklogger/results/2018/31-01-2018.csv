31-01-2018T00:35:05,Twokinds,He was in the hospital for a while from the flu. He hasn't done well in years.
31-01-2018T00:35:43,wolfspartan1,i'm sorry to hear that
31-01-2018T00:35:50,Dadrobit,"Oof, hoping for the best man."
31-01-2018T00:36:11,Twokinds,It's alright. He's now in a better nursing facility than he was before.
31-01-2018T00:36:23,Dadrobit,Good to hear.
31-01-2018T00:36:33,Twokinds,"So some good came out of it. The other place wasn't treating him well for a long time, apparently."
31-01-2018T00:36:52,Dadrobit,That's shitty as all get out!
31-01-2018T00:37:21,TheBeckoner,Dang that is garbage.
31-01-2018T00:37:24,unsteddyphoenix,Oh woah. That's pretty bad.
31-01-2018T00:37:39,unsteddyphoenix,It's hard to know what really goes on in those places.
31-01-2018T00:37:43,Twokinds,Yeah.
31-01-2018T00:38:19,Twokinds,Life dealt him a really raw deal. I wouldn't wish it on anyone.

31-01-2018T00:46:23,wolfspartan1,sorry for your loss
31-01-2018T00:46:56,unsteddyphoenix,Im sure he was a cool guy
31-01-2018T00:47:23,TheBeckoner,He had to be. He was fly as heck.
31-01-2018T00:49:01,Dadrobit,"Ty, doctors said what finally did him in was the long term affects from the asbestos they used in the ships in WW2."

31-01-2018T23:04:06,Combak,"I forgot about him, I expected to join when Chu came on. XD"

31-01-2018T23:28:49,Char89TheCharizard,I'm talking about Chu. The artist behind Slightly Damned
31-01-2018T23:30:07,Bgrmystr2,"Oh, Chu is a person"
31-01-2018T23:30:09,Bgrmystr2,okay

31-01-2018T23:33:17,Char89TheCharizard,yeah
31-01-2018T23:36:52,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all!
31-01-2018T23:37:17,unsteddyphoenix,yo daddy
31-01-2018T23:42:41,Dadrobit,Just finished up w/ homework for the weekend.
31-01-2018T23:42:45,Dadrobit,feelsgoodman
31-01-2018T23:43:04,wolfspartan1,back and ello
31-01-2018T23:44:35,Dadrobit,"Some lady in the class submitted an essay that was almost completely plagarised, so GG. Gonna see how that turned out next class on Monday"
31-01-2018T23:44:52,unsteddyphoenix,Iiinteresting
31-01-2018T23:45:00,unsteddyphoenix,They have those programs that check that now
31-01-2018T23:45:37,Dadrobit,Dunno if that's gonna work here. The submission process is done through a discussion board.
31-01-2018T23:46:00,Dadrobit,So the professor would probably have to copy everything herself and run it manually.
31-01-2018T23:46:19,Dadrobit,"Or, ya know, copy the first sentance and do a Bing search."
31-01-2018T23:46:37,unsteddyphoenix,Wow didnt even bother changing the beginning huh?
31-01-2018T23:46:44,unsteddyphoenix,tsk tsk
31-01-2018T23:47:41,Dadrobit,"She omitted some parts, but it's pretty much straight ripped."
31-01-2018T23:48:11,unsteddyphoenix,Amazing
31-01-2018T23:48:43,unsteddyphoenix,Yo you seen Shape of Water?
31-01-2018T23:50:00,Dadrobit,Yeah.... It was awkward....
31-01-2018T23:50:35,Dadrobit,"Watched it with grandma, it got uncomfortable fast."
31-01-2018T23:50:36,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha
31-01-2018T23:50:52,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah I was gonna say, my favourite part of the movie was the old ladies sitting next to me"
31-01-2018T23:51:50,Dadrobit,Buncha racist old people in my theatre happily laughing at the slurs getting tossed around in the movie kinda killed the vibe for me as well.
31-01-2018T23:53:02,unsteddyphoenix,"Feels bad, didnt really have that~"
31-01-2018T23:54:09,unsteddyphoenix,Dont even know how I feel about the movie I was so distracted by the EVENT
31-01-2018T23:54:29,Dadrobit,Event?
31-01-2018T23:56:23,unsteddyphoenix,"You know, when they...""bathed"" together"
31-01-2018T23:56:39,Dadrobit,"Oh, for sure."
31-01-2018T23:56:44,unsteddyphoenix,And then went into weirdly unnecessary detail afterwards
31-01-2018T23:56:56,Dadrobit,"Or, ya know, that point 5 minutes in when she's enjoying herself in the tub."
31-01-2018T23:57:30,unsteddyphoenix,"Thats like, basically her introductory shot lmao"
31-01-2018T23:59:25,Dadrobit,"Yup, it was funny when my sister-in-law's mother was asking if she should take her grandkid, (my 9 year old nephew) to see it."
31-01-2018T23:59:49,Dadrobit,"""Yeaaaah, maybe wait a couple years..."""
