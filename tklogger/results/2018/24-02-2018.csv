24-02-2018T09:55:37,Zero08,it is only 10am in EST
24-02-2018T09:56:18,Zero08,im sure we'll catch more peeps as the day goes on :&gt; depending how long Neko streams and all that of course
24-02-2018T10:00:17,Nekonny,yeah ^^
24-02-2018T10:00:26,Nekonny,I'm still in a multi with sage
24-02-2018T10:00:33,Nekonny,so most people here are idle
24-02-2018T10:05:58,Zero08,i never really watch sage's streams that much if imma be honest
24-02-2018T10:06:38,denmander,I don't watch streams that much
24-02-2018T10:07:37,Nekonny,really
24-02-2018T10:07:43,Nekonny,I see you pretty often ^^
24-02-2018T10:07:58,Nekonny,Sage has improved a lot lately
24-02-2018T10:08:12,Nekonny,and I really like the direction hes been taking his new AI comic
24-02-2018T10:08:29,sunblaze,^:P
24-02-2018T10:09:21,Nekonny,"I do read Yosh as well, but to be honest the whole storyline has me a bit lost. I mean, thats just a personal opnion"
24-02-2018T10:09:22,Zero08,Hello Sunblaze :&gt;
24-02-2018T10:09:44,Nekonny,It just bears the wheight of its own size
24-02-2018T10:09:58,sunblaze,hiya
24-02-2018T10:11:16,Zero08,i read the beginning of Tosh but never got very far ;w; im a terrible reader who easily gets distracted
24-02-2018T10:12:03,Zero08,Only katbox comics i fully read up to date is Rascals due to me mainly reading it in class when i have no work left to do and the teacher is doing something else -p-
24-02-2018T10:12:48,Zero08,I still need to finish Caribbean Blue cause i lost track where i was one day and had to start over xD
24-02-2018T10:13:34,denmander,I just read sage's and neko's comics : P
24-02-2018T10:14:05,Zero08,actually i do remember finishing las lindas but i have read it in a while so im behind on most recent pages -w-
24-02-2018T10:14:26,Zero08,its funny too cause i have katbox's twitter on notice so i can know when new pages come out xD
24-02-2018T10:15:14,Nekonny,"I mean, honestly there aren't many KB comics that were originally created with a professional mindset"
24-02-2018T10:15:42,Nekonny,"for most uf us, it was our first time doing comics"
24-02-2018T10:15:49,Nekonny,so we all made rookie mistakes
24-02-2018T10:16:04,Nekonny,hindsight is 20-20
24-02-2018T10:16:44,Nekonny,Ive read pretty much all the KB comics
24-02-2018T10:16:59,Nekonny,but  not consistently
24-02-2018T10:17:16,Nekonny,some are really long and harder to pick up
24-02-2018T10:18:06,Zero08,I mean i most likely never notice mistakes xD unless its a typo or something :p
24-02-2018T10:18:06,Nekonny,"hang on, need restroom break"
24-02-2018T10:23:22,Nekonny,back

24-02-2018T10:32:31,Nekonny,it is a charecter from one of the first artists I started following
24-02-2018T10:32:35,Nekonny,way back in
24-02-2018T10:32:44,Nekonny,early 2000

24-02-2018T10:38:39,Nekonny,"He had this site with art, stories and games"
24-02-2018T10:39:31,Nekonny,the stories were about this group of nekomimi maids that worked in a house or hotel (never quite sure which one it was)
24-02-2018T10:39:39,Zero08,Hi AMP :&gt;
24-02-2018T10:40:07,Nekonny,"the stories were written, with 3 or 4 illustrations that covered the highlights"
24-02-2018T10:40:14,Nekonny,the artwork was very sharp
24-02-2018T10:45:59,Nekonny,this week I'll be focusing on patreon
24-02-2018T10:46:21,Nekonny,and hopefully even the one for march if I can get that done soon ^^
24-02-2018T10:49:10,Tharkis,:ctharkis-earwiggle:

24-02-2018T10:56:48,denmander,I still don't do taxes
24-02-2018T10:57:00,Nekonny,I didnt have any kickstarters this year
24-02-2018T10:57:45,Nekonny,So I could just try to do a simple free one
24-02-2018T10:58:37,Tharkis,"i itemize because of my mortgage, and ontop of htat this last year i had a stock transaction , only netted me like 100$ but the result is like an extra 10 pages of tax work"
24-02-2018T10:58:42,Tharkis,totally not worth the 100 bucks
24-02-2018T10:59:19,Blacklight,Oh yeah
24-02-2018T10:59:26,Blacklight,Dividends makes it worse.
24-02-2018T10:59:34,Blacklight,Although if it's only 100 I think you might be exempt.
24-02-2018T11:01:06,Blacklight,"Also I have to say this legally. I am not a CPA or a tax specalist. I never got my CPA liscensure, but I did go to college for four years for a business degree so yeah. Don't take what I say as tax advice."
24-02-2018T11:02:40,Tharkis,cat maids are &lt;3

24-02-2018T11:27:24,Nekonny,Not sure I like the colors to much
24-02-2018T11:27:51,Nekonny,I think it mat be because I was sampling for illustrations with lighting effects turned on
24-02-2018T11:28:04,Nekonny,so some seem more vivid than they needed to be
24-02-2018T11:29:21,Nekonny,https://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?id=96253
24-02-2018T11:29:35,Nekonny,"is it just me, or are thumbnails not rendering there?"

24-02-2018T16:28:57,MviluUatusun,"While I was in Orlando, I didn't have access to the internet.  Needless to say, I've got a ton of e-mails I need to read."
24-02-2018T16:29:03,TheBeckoner,@BadFoMo Ah ok
24-02-2018T16:29:14,CheeseRS,"Well Flora was in heat so... Yeah, it's going to be a hot night"
24-02-2018T16:29:16,ThingsAreMoving,I wonder what could Bob Ross accomplish with a decent drawing tablet
24-02-2018T16:29:20,ThingsAreMoving,guess we'll never know
24-02-2018T16:29:22,CheeseRS,"Ah, undertale"
24-02-2018T16:29:40,MviluUatusun,"That be true, yes, Things."
24-02-2018T16:30:04,Bgrmystr2,"Happy trees, Things."
24-02-2018T16:30:07,Bgrmystr2,Happy trees.
24-02-2018T16:30:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though it could also be a summer night, not winter. Would explain why they’re skinny dipping"
24-02-2018T16:30:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,happy tree here and here
24-02-2018T16:30:18,MviluUatusun,"That ain' all that's happy, Bgr.  LOL."
24-02-2018T16:30:23,CamtheGamerMan,@ThingsAreMoving It would probably magically appear on his tablet :)
24-02-2018T16:30:24,ItsActuallyKopyKat,And some happy mountains in the background
24-02-2018T16:30:27,Bgrmystr2,"maybe not, Mvilu"
24-02-2018T16:30:29,ZephyrTWolffox,hurhur
24-02-2018T16:30:34,Bgrmystr2,"but the trees ARE happy, are they not?"
24-02-2018T16:30:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"and one next to this one, because every one needs a friend"
24-02-2018T16:30:47,MviluUatusun,"Yup.  You're right there, Bgr."
24-02-2018T16:30:49,CheeseRS,"I am questioning it only now, but are Trace and Flora kissing in a lake or a river?"
24-02-2018T16:30:55,Bgrmystr2,k then. shh :P
24-02-2018T16:30:57,TheBeckoner,Are they truly happy?
24-02-2018T16:31:04,CheeseRS,Yes they are
24-02-2018T16:31:06,Bgrmystr2,xD beck... sometimes.
24-02-2018T16:31:06,CamtheGamerMan,I thinks its a lake
24-02-2018T16:31:14,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Cheese, probably a lake... rivers flow"
24-02-2018T16:31:20,MviluUatusun,"Speaking of happy trees.  I think Tom read your comment, Bgr."

24-02-2018T16:31:54,Bgrmystr2,You say that like tom doesn't read the comments haha
24-02-2018T16:32:06,TheBeckoner,Tom reads all
24-02-2018T16:32:10,ThingsAreMoving,stream is lagging a bit every onw ang again
24-02-2018T16:32:11,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Me too... it's probably a connectivity error on the host's end
24-02-2018T16:32:12,TheBeckoner,Tom is everywhere.
24-02-2018T16:32:13,Bgrmystr2,tom was gonna draw trees anyway. Coincidence much :P
24-02-2018T16:32:14,ThingsAreMoving,"not just you, cheese"
24-02-2018T16:32:25,MviluUatusun,I didn't mean to imply he don't.  I meant to say that he decided to follow your comment.
24-02-2018T16:32:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,@Bgrmystr2  I think NOT!!!!
24-02-2018T16:32:36,CheeseRS,"Hey Tom, if you read this, can you draw an impossible to notice smile on the water?"
24-02-2018T16:32:45,Bgrmystr2,I think my comment just happened to coincide with him drawin trees.  :v
24-02-2018T16:32:53,NeonMitsumi,@CheeseRS He already did.
24-02-2018T16:32:54,MviluUatusun,"To quote a very famous NCIS special agent, ""I don't believe in coincidence.""  LOL."

24-02-2018T16:34:13,ItsActuallyKopyKat,laptops are quite warm... cats dig that
24-02-2018T16:34:38,ThingsAreMoving,cats dig laptops?

24-02-2018T16:34:52,CheeseRS,"The thing I like the most about Tom's art is the shading he does at the end, can't wait for it"
24-02-2018T16:35:22,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Tom's shading &gt; shading in real life

24-02-2018T16:37:16,MviluUatusun,I'm going to have to come up with a good name for my next cat.
24-02-2018T16:37:16,SpazztasticKiwi,My cats name should be “Stop That”

24-02-2018T16:38:23,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"My poor cat has a bit of an identity crisis. When we got him, we thought he was a she, and named her Artemis. Then we found out he was in fact, a boy, and renamed him Artemister. But that was too long so now we just call him ""boy"""

24-02-2018T16:38:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Why do we always cycle around to cats
24-02-2018T16:39:05,TheBeckoner,Im gonna name my cat concrete

24-02-2018T16:43:21,Bgrmystr2,still dunno why you people use autocorrect when it just messes your sentences up anyway. Not like it has any idea what you're trying to say xD
24-02-2018T16:43:30,ThingsAreMoving,^
24-02-2018T16:43:40,CamtheGamerMan,Man the background and the reflection in the water really came together
24-02-2018T16:43:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m pretty sure my autocorrect hates me
24-02-2018T16:43:55,Bgrmystr2,yeah the reflection's not lookin too bad.

24-02-2018T16:44:01,ItsActuallyKopyKat,sometimes it saves you though... you type some kid of unintelligible nonsense and it makes a coherent sentence
24-02-2018T16:44:09,CrimsonHelsing,"Moon looks rather bright don't it? Or is it just me? Regardless, I like how it makes the background look .u."

24-02-2018T18:37:45,PalmettoPathfinder1,I mean if someone wants to play a xenophobic militaristic empire let them! Just make sure they are aware of the consequences.  The war exhaustion system pretty much hurts the play styles people want to play.

24-02-2018T18:39:05,PalmettoPathfinder1,it's like master of Orion.  A 4x grand strategy space game
24-02-2018T18:39:10,KiTA,@PalmettoPathfinder1  I played a bit of my standard Determined Assimilator playthrough....  was
24-02-2018T18:39:16,KiTA,surprised to see that NO federations appeared
24-02-2018T18:39:20,KiTA,"like, at ALL"
24-02-2018T18:39:45,KiTA,"normally a little ways into the game I see the entire map filled with 2, maybe 3 huge federations and I have to turn into a turtle, picking off rebels here and there"
24-02-2018T18:39:46,Terramaster20209,Supreme commander anyone ?
24-02-2018T18:40:12,PalmettoPathfinder1,Yeah I know.  I tried to play fanatic purifiers but I never saw any Federations forming.  I was bummed out.  I wanted my conquest of the galaxy to be epic!  Not tedious!

24-02-2018T18:41:20,Starz,these**

24-02-2018T18:41:29,KiTA,one of the lead dev's twitter playthroughs was him being a xeno... philic / spiritual / pacifist type that infested others with pacificism
24-02-2018T18:41:30,Whitestripes,What Starz said
24-02-2018T18:41:35,ThingsAreMoving,Their ship is strong like a battlecruiser
24-02-2018T18:41:35,ProsePro7,She has such a bright fut color
24-02-2018T18:41:43,KiTA,I rather like the Determined Assimilator playthrough but it's uh... I don't know
24-02-2018T18:41:52,BadFoMo,I too ship these two.
24-02-2018T18:42:03,KiTA,I might go back to Hive Mind (the non-purifier type)
24-02-2018T18:42:16,ProsePro7,So many shippers
24-02-2018T18:42:26,KiTA,"I hear he wants to go back and update the biological and robomodding stuff so you can make more extreme and specalized pops, that'll be nice"
24-02-2018T18:42:27,PalmettoPathfinder1,Yeah.  But I wish they had kept the other two FTL types.  They could have made one FTL inhibitor that affected each FTL type differently.  Well someone will figure out how to mod warp and wormhole travel back into the game.

24-02-2018T18:43:28,KiTA,"like this playthrough I started next to a fanatic purifier, who couldn't get to me because the Ruby Crystals homeworld was in the way on the only hyperlane into my space"
24-02-2018T18:43:39,Mippy,I'm just going to sit here and pretend I understand the conversation.
24-02-2018T18:43:45,ThingsAreMoving,+1
24-02-2018T18:43:50,PalmettoPathfinder1,Yeah does make things interesting.  Although
24-02-2018T18:43:56,KiTA,So I just spread down the rest of the spiral arm I was in and ate the other two empires over there
24-02-2018T18:43:56,ProsePro7,...the chat has been taken over I see
24-02-2018T18:44:07,ThingsAreMoving,what does make me interesting?
24-02-2018T18:44:26,PalmettoPathfinder1,I did like the army attachments. Sad to see them go
24-02-2018T18:44:46,ItsActuallyKopyKat,^^^ big mood
24-02-2018T18:45:06,ProsePro7,So Tom when do we get to see Kei and Reni in the shower together?
24-02-2018T18:45:07,TheBeckoner,&gt;Booty is good
24-02-2018T18:45:24,ThingsAreMoving,+1 to prose's question

24-02-2018T19:00:17,ItsActuallyKopyKat,yeha i got the literal translation
24-02-2018T19:00:34,Kinipshun,Neko (猫) is the Japanese word for cat. It's commonly referred to as a half human half cat; a human with cat features like a tail and ears.
24-02-2018T19:00:41,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Kinipshun maybe!
24-02-2018T19:00:47,ProsePro7,Lovu lovu kemo mimi!

24-02-2018T19:00:54,ZRO4825,"Its common usage is short for ""Nekomimi"", literally ""cat ears"""
24-02-2018T19:01:07,BadFoMo,...A Neko like Raine's half form.

24-02-2018T19:01:37,Starz,human eveything but cat traits and ears and tail
24-02-2018T19:01:46,TorqueEmUp,Rather it be a more interesting mix of human and cat.
24-02-2018T19:01:57,KiTA,I think it'll be just like the main character of halfkinds
24-02-2018T19:01:59,Starz,thats what we are thinking but waht will the baby look like
24-02-2018T19:01:59,TorqueEmUp,not just lazy cat ears and tail pasted to a human
24-02-2018T19:02:03,KiTA,"in fact, I bet it looks pretty similra to her"
24-02-2018T19:02:08,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah it'll def be neko with cat forearms and lower legs
24-02-2018T19:02:10,TerraTheWizard,keidran with human ears & no tail?

24-02-2018T19:40:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m at a dinner. There’s kids running around
24-02-2018T19:40:17,unsteddyphoenix,Did you point and laugh?
24-02-2018T19:40:43,SpazztasticKiwi,No I was shocked at the thump noise
24-02-2018T19:40:59,unsteddyphoenix,youve wasted a chance

24-02-2018T19:41:28,DarthRexKing,Agreed with steddy. The humiliation along with the pain would teach them to be more careful.
24-02-2018T19:41:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not one for kids but I’m not soulless
24-02-2018T19:42:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Besides I wouldn’t have been able to get close with the crowd of concerned people that descended on her
24-02-2018T19:42:22,DarthRexKing,"Does not matter, the sooner children realise how clumsy they are compared to more coordinate adults, even if it pisses them off, will motivate them to be better."
24-02-2018T19:43:15,DarthRexKing,So she was coddled. What a shame.
24-02-2018T19:43:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I know. I wasn’t too concerned- she was just shocked more than hurt; it’s everyone else that panicked
24-02-2018T19:43:32,DarthRexKing,Fools.

24-02-2018T20:11:50,SpazztasticKiwi,The second one feels more like Get Hit on in the Showers
24-02-2018T20:11:54,Ordithus,lol
24-02-2018T20:12:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Poor guy had panic written all over him

24-02-2018T20:16:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh no 😆
24-02-2018T20:16:44,TorqueEmUp,Honestly Hit the Showers was just fine in my book
24-02-2018T20:16:44,Ordithus,"Fourth was Reporting Back, fifth was Nibbly"
24-02-2018T20:17:16,Ordithus,Lots of tigers it seems
24-02-2018T20:17:23,SpazztasticKiwi,It was pretty good - double meaning with “hit”
24-02-2018T20:17:50,TorqueEmUp,Nibbly ^^

24-02-2018T20:18:07,unsteddyphoenix,loud showers
24-02-2018T20:18:07,Ordithus,Showers are kind of loud
24-02-2018T20:18:13,unsteddyphoenix,Never seen a horror movie?
24-02-2018T20:18:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"Showers are loud yes, but that’s why we lock doors"
24-02-2018T20:18:39,Ordithus,Also pretty open in the barrack's showers.  It's probably normal for someone to walk in.
24-02-2018T20:18:47,Ordithus,Not normal for a tiger girl though...
24-02-2018T20:18:55,unsteddyphoenix,He probably just thought it was Lt. Reed at first.

24-02-2018T20:19:42,Ordithus,Like a loofah?
24-02-2018T20:19:47,unsteddyphoenix,^

24-02-2018T20:21:26,Dadrobit,:thinking:
24-02-2018T20:21:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I tend to break out
24-02-2018T20:21:55,Dadrobit,"Those aren't rashes, it's just confidence bubbling up to the surface."
24-02-2018T20:22:02,Dadrobit,You get used to it
24-02-2018T20:22:05,CrRAR,ha
24-02-2018T20:22:08,CrRAR,ha ha
24-02-2018T20:22:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Besides I have no need for old spice. I like honey and ginger and vanilla
24-02-2018T20:23:05,unsteddyphoenix,But you can smell like the man your man could smell like!
24-02-2018T20:23:28,Dadrobit,^^^
24-02-2018T20:23:42,SpazztasticKiwi,There is an axe fragrance I bought once that smelled like chocolate
24-02-2018T20:23:59,CrRAR,mmm mmm
24-02-2018T20:24:15,Dadrobit,Axe? Why would yo do that to yourself?
24-02-2018T20:24:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Exactly. But I don’t think they make it anymore
24-02-2018T20:24:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Both products need serving suggestions though
24-02-2018T20:25:02,unsteddyphoenix,haha agreed
24-02-2018T20:25:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve had guys come into work and I smell them from an aisle away
24-02-2018T20:25:28,Dadrobit,Haven't even smelt Axe since I got out of High Scool. I recall getting headaches in the locker room from damned near every guy using half the bottle in a go....
24-02-2018T20:25:35,Dadrobit,School*
24-02-2018T20:25:46,SpazztasticKiwi,“Nice cologne. Did you have to marinate in it?”
24-02-2018T20:28:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"Deodorant, and maybe two spritzes and you’re good"
24-02-2018T20:29:41,Dadrobit,Don't even use cologne. Just deodorant and body wash.
24-02-2018T20:29:50,Dadrobit,Not in that order
24-02-2018T20:30:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Good choice
24-02-2018T20:30:04,unsteddyphoenix,"I have ""special occasion"" cologne but that's it"
24-02-2018T20:30:31,unsteddyphoenix,Roll-on deodorant avoids that problem~
24-02-2018T20:30:33,Dadrobit,Ohhhhh~ Fancy~
24-02-2018T20:30:50,Dadrobit,Roll on deodorant is the best. Literally life changing
24-02-2018T20:30:54,unsteddyphoenix,Im a phancyman
24-02-2018T20:31:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I do admire the lasting effects cologne has. I have some simple scented perfumes that don’t last the walk out the door
24-02-2018T20:31:39,unsteddyphoenix,Haha
24-02-2018T20:32:13,unsteddyphoenix,"I smell perfume more often than I smell cologne, personally"
24-02-2018T20:32:21,Dadrobit,Same
24-02-2018T20:33:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Some people I’ll walk by smell amazing. Guys and girls
24-02-2018T20:35:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m sometimes tempted to ask what they got on
24-02-2018T20:35:46,Dadrobit,"If a guy is comfortable wearing a noticable cologne, they're comfortable with someone askin them what it is."
24-02-2018T20:35:52,Dadrobit,(usually)
24-02-2018T20:35:57,Dadrobit,asking*
24-02-2018T20:36:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"Thing is, I’ve asked a guy before and he told me he doesn’t wear cologne"
24-02-2018T20:36:49,Ordithus,Akward
24-02-2018T20:36:52,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha
24-02-2018T20:36:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"So whatever that guy does, he smelled good"

24-02-2018T20:39:54,unsteddyphoenix,I think we're still safe
24-02-2018T20:39:54,Dadrobit,"Yet? Dude's known us for years, it's pretty well established what our personas are"

24-02-2018T21:28:05,TheBeckoner,smokes*
24-02-2018T21:28:08,TheBeckoner,and they arent
24-02-2018T21:28:55,SpazztasticKiwi,We don’t ever stay on one topic long
24-02-2018T21:29:33,Ordithus,I was wondering how writing a speech and the teacher smoking weed were related.  I think robit figured it out.
24-02-2018T21:41:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I just found out I’m off tomorrow
24-02-2018T21:41:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless they call me in
24-02-2018T21:42:18,unsteddyphoenix,\o/
24-02-2018T21:42:22,Ordithus,Nice
24-02-2018T21:42:26,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe Tom will stream tomorrow too
24-02-2018T21:42:45,Dadrobit,Enjoy the time yo
24-02-2018T21:43:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Eh he can have the time off. Maybe he’ll make another “for fun” sketch
24-02-2018T21:43:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Or maybe he’s making one now...😯
24-02-2018T21:43:43,unsteddyphoenix,He sometimes does the last two the day after.
24-02-2018T21:43:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Or dinner
24-02-2018T21:44:02,unsteddyphoenix,But yeah
24-02-2018T21:44:34,unsteddyphoenix,Should indulge himself when he can~
24-02-2018T21:44:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Schedules are great but farting around keeps you young
24-02-2018T21:45:20,unsteddyphoenix,Deep.
24-02-2018T21:45:27,Dadrobit,"Chili is the fountain of youth, confirmed"
24-02-2018T21:45:36,unsteddyphoenix,booo
24-02-2018T21:45:38,Ordithus,Responsibility is adulthood
24-02-2018T21:46:30,unsteddyphoenix,Miss me with that
24-02-2018T21:46:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Ew
24-02-2018T21:48:17,SpazztasticKiwi,You must be fun at parties
24-02-2018T21:49:14,Ordithus,Why do you think I'm watching youtue and a TK recording when I could be cleaning or something.
24-02-2018T21:49:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I clean while watching YouTube
24-02-2018T21:50:43,TheBeckoner,I eat and watch youtube.
24-02-2018T21:51:03,unsteddyphoenix,I eat and watch streams then cough and mfling bread everywhere
24-02-2018T21:51:26,unsteddyphoenix,Im still picking up bits of bread ugh
24-02-2018T21:51:50,SpazztasticKiwi,That reminds me I’m going to Atlanta March 30
24-02-2018T21:51:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I need to request off
24-02-2018T21:52:00,unsteddyphoenix,Does?
24-02-2018T21:52:00,TheBeckoner,Just let a bunch of bird into your house.
24-02-2018T21:52:05,unsteddyphoenix,!!!
24-02-2018T21:52:09,unsteddyphoenix,Smart!
24-02-2018T21:52:12,TheBeckoner,birds*
24-02-2018T21:52:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Birds can’t digest white bread
24-02-2018T21:53:15,Ordithus,That sounds like an old wives' tale
24-02-2018T21:53:30,unsteddyphoenix,I did hear ducks cant
24-02-2018T21:53:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Then google it and find out for sure
24-02-2018T21:53:51,TheBeckoner,Can Unsteddy eat white bread?
24-02-2018T21:53:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t care if you take my word for it
24-02-2018T21:53:57,unsteddyphoenix,Technically if you declare something youre the one thats supposed to provide proof
24-02-2018T21:54:01,unsteddyphoenix,Apparently I cant so.
24-02-2018T21:54:03,unsteddyphoenix,Proof.
24-02-2018T21:54:07,TheBeckoner,huh
24-02-2018T21:54:08,Ordithus,I know they shouldn't eat rice
24-02-2018T21:54:15,TheBeckoner,welp that settles it I guess
24-02-2018T21:54:18,Ordithus,"They can and will, then die :("
24-02-2018T21:54:40,TheBeckoner,My dad fed a bunch of ducks sweet feed once...they all exploded
24-02-2018T21:54:50,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds like you ate well
24-02-2018T21:54:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"In my experience, even providing proof won’t change some people’s minds"
24-02-2018T21:55:11,unsteddyphoenix,still thought.
24-02-2018T21:55:30,TheBeckoner,Lol I dont think anyone currently here is that stuck on white bread ideas
24-02-2018T21:55:50,TheBeckoner,Im too lazy to look it up so I really dont care either way.
24-02-2018T21:57:02,Ordithus,"According to this popsci article, it's only because it's calories without other nutrition"
24-02-2018T21:57:25,Ordithus,"And birds will preferentially eat it, so not so great for their health."
24-02-2018T22:00:09,Dadrobit,"Sooooo, like humans."
24-02-2018T22:00:19,Ordithus,Too true
24-02-2018T22:00:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I prefer oat bread
24-02-2018T22:00:38,NightMeaty22,I dont eat
24-02-2018T22:00:44,Dadrobit,"And pretty much any low nutrition, high calories food."
24-02-2018T22:03:03,NightMeaty22,Hello btw
24-02-2018T22:03:09,Ordithus,Hi Night

24-02-2018T22:04:08,NightMeaty22,Ok i guess
24-02-2018T22:04:53,NightMeaty22,Life just sucks
24-02-2018T22:05:09,Ordithus,:(
24-02-2018T22:05:49,NightMeaty22,Or my life just sucks i dont know how your life is
24-02-2018T22:05:49,TheBeckoner,It do.
24-02-2018T22:06:43,NightMeaty22,The more i think about life the more depressed i get
24-02-2018T22:06:49,Ordithus,I'm good.
24-02-2018T22:07:07,TheBeckoner,Simple solution: dont think.
24-02-2018T22:07:22,NightMeaty22,No easy
24-02-2018T22:08:42,NightMeaty22,I think the main reason i dont like life is because people judg me by things i did 8 years ago
24-02-2018T22:09:04,Dadrobit,Stop killing people yo
24-02-2018T22:09:07,TheBeckoner,^
24-02-2018T22:09:18,NightMeaty22,I dont kill
24-02-2018T22:09:20,TheBeckoner,Mustve been pretty big then lol
24-02-2018T22:09:40,TheBeckoner,"&gt;Dont eat people live, either"
24-02-2018T22:09:44,Dadrobit,"Either you really fucked up, or you need to get those people out of your life. Simple."
24-02-2018T22:09:57,NightMeaty22,I was 6 so...
24-02-2018T22:10:13,Dadrobit,"Ohhhhhh, so just teenage edge, gotcha."
24-02-2018T22:10:34,NightMeaty22,And i dont rember any thing before i was 8 so...
24-02-2018T22:10:45,Dadrobit,That makes getting over it that much easier
24-02-2018T22:12:16,NightMeaty22,I am just hated for some thing i cant rember
24-02-2018T22:12:38,Dadrobit,"Own it then, start making shit up."
24-02-2018T22:12:57,Dadrobit,"You're 14, you people are great at making shit up"
24-02-2018T22:13:31,NightMeaty22,Are you saying i am making shit up
24-02-2018T22:13:56,Dadrobit,I'm saying you should make shit up and have fun with it
24-02-2018T22:14:13,Dadrobit,"own your mistakes, wear them as armor, and no one can hurt you."
24-02-2018T22:14:42,Dadrobit,Or complain on the internet to people you don't know and can't actually physically help you. See which one makes you happier.
24-02-2018T22:15:08,NightMeaty22,Ok i will kill my self now
24-02-2018T22:15:50,TheBeckoner,Running with something tends to be much more fun imo.
24-02-2018T22:16:11,Dadrobit,:thinking: Seems a good responsible response.
24-02-2018T22:17:07,TheBeckoner,Me or him? Im guessing you mean him.
24-02-2018T22:17:20,Dadrobit,Him.
24-02-2018T22:17:32,TheBeckoner,gotcha
24-02-2018T22:17:45,unsteddyphoenix,To be fair it does 100% sound like he's making stuff up
24-02-2018T22:18:07,Ordithus,"Night, chill.  I'm pretty sure Dadrobit is trying to give you what advice he can over the chat."
24-02-2018T22:18:17,unsteddyphoenix,What a good dad?
24-02-2018T22:18:26,unsteddyphoenix,Accidental questionmark lol
24-02-2018T22:18:28,Dadrobit,As dads do.
24-02-2018T22:19:05,TheBeckoner,"Are you actually a dad, Dad?"
24-02-2018T22:19:08,unsteddyphoenix,Allegedly
24-02-2018T22:19:13,Dadrobit,"Was giving you the beefit of the doubt on that ""?"" unsteddy lol"
24-02-2018T22:19:22,Dadrobit,benefit*
24-02-2018T22:19:24,unsteddyphoenix,Thank you?
24-02-2018T22:19:32,TheBeckoner,"""Beefit"" - a workout for the beefolk."
24-02-2018T22:19:35,Dadrobit,"Naw, fuck kids"
24-02-2018T22:19:44,Dadrobit,"I mean, don't fuck kids"
24-02-2018T22:19:50,Dadrobit,but fuck 'em
24-02-2018T22:19:52,TheBeckoner,lol I sure hope not
24-02-2018T22:19:53,unsteddyphoenix,Kids suck
24-02-2018T22:19:57,unsteddyphoenix,But not in that way
24-02-2018T22:20:01,Dadrobit,Always making shit up
24-02-2018T22:20:06,Ordithus,:ptv-confused::ptv-uneasy:
24-02-2018T22:20:18,unsteddyphoenix,Need that edgy backstory
24-02-2018T22:20:23,unsteddyphoenix,To be a speshal snowflake
24-02-2018T22:21:02,Dadrobit,"Eughh, did the edge for about a semester in high school, then just figured out it was just better being awkward."
24-02-2018T22:21:31,unsteddyphoenix,I kept all my edge inside
24-02-2018T22:21:41,unsteddyphoenix,"I was like, semi-self aware"
24-02-2018T22:22:51,TheBeckoner,I wanna say I was self aware but i dunno. I was pretty awkward though.
24-02-2018T22:23:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I was quiet in school. Now I don’t seem to have an off button
24-02-2018T22:23:16,NightMeaty22,What the fuck people hate me for something that happened but the people are to fucking stupid to know what my life was/is like
24-02-2018T22:23:18,Dadrobit,Thank goodness I grew up before social media was a real thing. Only a very few posts that incriminate me on Facebook for being less than I am now
24-02-2018T22:23:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I swing wildly from never shutting up to turning into a stump
24-02-2018T22:24:12,Dadrobit,"Now with the power of hindsight, I can make new posts with the power of foresight."
24-02-2018T22:24:14,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I only have minimal dumb shit on my social media
24-02-2018T22:25:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn’t join a whole lot of social media until I found people to follow
24-02-2018T22:25:41,Dadrobit,"Still don't own a personal Twitter. Need to get on that, but still kinda cautious."
24-02-2018T22:26:18,Dadrobit,"Only tweet about business stuff, makes it easy to stay neutral and available."
24-02-2018T22:26:52,Dadrobit,Don't wanna lose because someone sees a tweet they don't like or some dumb shit like that
24-02-2018T22:27:05,Dadrobit,lose clients*
24-02-2018T22:27:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I use mine to get updates and remark on random things I see
24-02-2018T22:29:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Imma go get a snack
24-02-2018T22:30:22,Dadrobit,Enjoy
24-02-2018T22:31:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Steak and rice with mushrooms? I will
24-02-2018T22:32:21,Ordithus,"Tom, I absolutely love the ""Hit the Showers"" color.  Nice work.  I hope you enjoyed making it!"
24-02-2018T22:32:32,Dadrobit,"Mushrooms are very hit/miss with me, good luck."
24-02-2018T22:33:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I suddenly have my cat’s full attention
24-02-2018T22:33:28,Ordithus,lol
24-02-2018T22:34:00,Dadrobit,As food does
24-02-2018T22:37:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Acts like he’s never fed
24-02-2018T22:37:38,SpazztasticKiwi,The meow is a lie
24-02-2018T22:38:22,Ordithus,Classic cat move
24-02-2018T22:39:09,SpazztasticKiwi,His move is to put his paw - ever so gently - on your leg or arm and just stare
24-02-2018T22:39:20,Ordithus,I would not be able to resist
24-02-2018T22:40:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"And if you ignore him, he taps"
24-02-2018T22:40:28,Ordithus,:ptv-excited: that is too adorable
24-02-2018T22:41:42,SpazztasticKiwi,My other cat uses the Jaws method: creeps closer every time you look away
24-02-2018T22:43:09,Ordithus,The only thing my parents' cat begs for is butter.
24-02-2018T22:44:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Not too bad a craving. Cats aren’t supposed to have dairy though
24-02-2018T22:44:20,Dadrobit,"My cat HATES human food, barely sniffs at it. But /will not/ leave me alone while I'm cooking."
24-02-2018T22:44:20,TheBeckoner,Butter? That seems strange.
24-02-2018T22:44:50,Ordithus,She is an odd one.  Ham? Whatever.  Chickin? Nothing.  Beef? Not interested.
24-02-2018T22:44:59,Ordithus,Butter?  MUST HAVE NAO
24-02-2018T22:45:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera likes carrots
24-02-2018T22:45:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Cats are weird
24-02-2018T22:45:51,Ordithus,One of my cats growing up liked mint
24-02-2018T22:46:01,Dadrobit,Bagheera's a great name for a cat
24-02-2018T22:47:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn’t name him. I wanted him to be Nightmare
24-02-2018T22:47:38,Dadrobit,Also a good one
24-02-2018T22:47:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"But when we were forced to keep him, my mom figured he’d be hers"
24-02-2018T22:48:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"She named him, but he liked to sit with me"
24-02-2018T22:49:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"After awhile, I gave up: he adopted me"
24-02-2018T22:51:11,unsteddyphoenix,always feed cat
24-02-2018T22:51:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh I give him more tidbits than he needs
24-02-2018T22:51:53,TheBeckoner,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qejDmpb1JKk
24-02-2018T22:51:55,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
24-02-2018T22:52:17,Ordithus,A fed kitty is a happy kitty
24-02-2018T22:53:03,unsteddyphoenix,Oh yeah I love that
24-02-2018T22:53:04,SpazztasticKiwi,My cats must be ecstatic then
24-02-2018T22:53:41,Dadrobit,Happy? Content is usually the word I'd use to describe Nyx.
24-02-2018T22:53:52,unsteddyphoenix,Content is the ideal
24-02-2018T23:03:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom how old’s your cat
24-02-2018T23:06:03,Twokinds,Uh... I think she's around 9?
24-02-2018T23:06:11,Twokinds,I actually can't remember exactly.
24-02-2018T23:06:54,Neverborn,Hi all
24-02-2018T23:06:59,Neverborn,am i too late?
24-02-2018T23:07:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"Not old but no spring chicken. Her name is Flora, isn’t it?"
24-02-2018T23:07:19,TheBeckoner,"""She exists at this point in time at her given biological age"" -Tom probably"
24-02-2018T23:07:26,Twokinds,Holly
24-02-2018T23:07:27,SpazztasticKiwi,For the stream? Late by about an hour
24-02-2018T23:07:45,Neverborn,oh well...  maybe next weekend
24-02-2018T23:07:47,Ordithus,My sister's cat is also named Holly.  She's around 9... are you my sister?!
24-02-2018T23:07:50,TheBeckoner,Like 3 hours lol
24-02-2018T23:07:54,SpazztasticKiwi,The internet seems to think it’s Flora
24-02-2018T23:08:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Holly is fitting though for a calico
24-02-2018T23:08:21,TheBeckoner,Finally finished this speech.
24-02-2018T23:08:28,TheBeckoner,is happy
24-02-2018T23:08:32,Ordithus,Congrats Beck
24-02-2018T23:08:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Gj
24-02-2018T23:11:45,TheBeckoner,thx
24-02-2018T23:11:54,TheBeckoner,Now maybe I can stop being anxious.
24-02-2018T23:13:34,Dadrobit,"Nice, I think it rubbed off on me though. Talking about youth earlier just has me pacing my house thinking about my personal brand of stupid."
24-02-2018T23:14:13,Dadrobit,I am not a smart man.
24-02-2018T23:15:54,Twokinds,lol
24-02-2018T23:16:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I worry about myself too
24-02-2018T23:16:27,TheBeckoner,Lol. Having a short memory can be good too. The only stuff I could worry about happened a while ago and anything I have screwed up recently I have forgotten! -except this speech
24-02-2018T23:16:50,TheBeckoner,I hope I haven't screwed it up...
24-02-2018T23:17:01,TheBeckoner,whale sea tho
24-02-2018T23:17:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I once used my phone’s flashlight to try to find my glasses so I could find my phone
24-02-2018T23:17:13,SpazztasticKiwi,But I wear contacts
24-02-2018T23:17:26,Ordithus,haha
24-02-2018T23:17:34,Dadrobit,"Like, relationships. I am bad at them. Last one ended over me making a Skyrim joke during snu snu and laughing at myself until she left and I literally never saw her again. No short memory is gonna let me forget that."
24-02-2018T23:17:34,TheBeckoner,I've lost my glasses on my head before
24-02-2018T23:17:48,Dadrobit,I am not a smart man...
24-02-2018T23:18:03,Twokinds,hahaha
24-02-2018T23:18:03,TheBeckoner,lol Dadro that sounds pretty good actually
24-02-2018T23:18:20,Twokinds,Man she wasn't worth it then
24-02-2018T23:18:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"As long as I understand what’s going on in a conversation, I won’t just drop a person"
24-02-2018T23:18:44,Dadrobit,"Oh, it was hilarious, and it was a fitting end to a relationship that never should have been, but still."
24-02-2018T23:19:12,Ordithus,"I'm kinda morbidly curious, what was the line?"
24-02-2018T23:19:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"That’s when I can get a little annoying, I think: I start asking questions"
24-02-2018T23:19:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Especially if I don’t know what’s going on
24-02-2018T23:19:54,Dadrobit,"She only liked me for my voice. Literally the only thing we had in common. She told me during the giggity to ""use your voice on me~"""
24-02-2018T23:19:59,Dadrobit,So I did.
24-02-2018T23:20:09,Ordithus,"Oh.  Oh god, hahaha"
24-02-2018T23:20:21,unsteddyphoenix,So like
24-02-2018T23:20:23,unsteddyphoenix,voice me daddy?
24-02-2018T23:20:29,Dadrobit,Pretty much
24-02-2018T23:20:44,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s....new
24-02-2018T23:20:45,unsteddyphoenix,I love that
24-02-2018T23:20:51,TheBeckoner,Funny
24-02-2018T23:21:52,SpazztasticKiwi,The voice is one thing; you should be interested in the personality
24-02-2018T23:22:19,unsteddyphoenix,So like...what was the joke?
24-02-2018T23:22:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Particularly since looks fade after a few years
24-02-2018T23:23:11,Dadrobit,"I was a till operator and she was a customer, it was all she knew about me when she propositioned. Didn't take too long to learn that there was nothing else between us. Whole thing didn't quite make 2 monhts"
24-02-2018T23:23:13,TheBeckoner,I hope I can look young for more than a few years...
24-02-2018T23:23:14,Dadrobit,months*
24-02-2018T23:24:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Sound like she’d have been a real catch
24-02-2018T23:24:19,SpazztasticKiwi,^sarcasm
24-02-2018T23:25:10,Dadrobit,"Telling the whole thing would require more verbage than I am allowed to use with younglings in the chat. But part of the punchline was ""Wuld Na Kest!"""
24-02-2018T23:25:47,unsteddyphoenix,Lol wow
24-02-2018T23:25:53,unsteddyphoenix,"So like, not even a common reference"
24-02-2018T23:26:32,Dadrobit,Her look of confusion and astonishment is half the reason I couldn
24-02-2018T23:26:33,unsteddyphoenix,Thought for sure it'd be fus roh dah
24-02-2018T23:26:38,Dadrobit,'t stop laughing
24-02-2018T23:26:54,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds worth it
24-02-2018T23:27:14,Dadrobit,"#Worth for sure, but it does still haunt me a bit"
24-02-2018T23:27:30,Ordithus,She's got a story to tell thanks to you
24-02-2018T23:28:00,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
24-02-2018T23:28:07,unsteddyphoenix,The long term investment that's what's up
24-02-2018T23:28:14,Dadrobit,That's the part that haunts me. It is my most dear and sincere hope that she re-tells it to someone in the future and they have to stifle a giggle.
24-02-2018T23:29:05,Dadrobit,Otherwise I just come off as a dick
24-02-2018T23:29:11,Ordithus,"Yeah, hopefully she doesn't dwell on it, and that it doesn't cause her crushing anxiety or something"
24-02-2018T23:29:24,unsteddyphoenix,Your reputation is being tarnished AS WE SPEAK
24-02-2018T23:29:33,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-floAAA:.
24-02-2018T23:30:05,unsteddyphoenix,Jesus Ord
24-02-2018T23:30:16,Ordithus,Did I go too far?
24-02-2018T23:30:26,unsteddyphoenix,"""Yeah I hope she doesnt have CRIPPLING DEPRESSION as a direct result of YOU, DAD. ALL YOUR FAULT."""
24-02-2018T23:30:33,Ordithus,lol
24-02-2018T23:30:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Eh she’s probably fine
24-02-2018T23:31:07,unsteddyphoenix,Ofc she is~
24-02-2018T23:31:19,unsteddyphoenix,Did she get the reference? :thinking:
24-02-2018T23:31:48,Dadrobit,"No, I think she definitely did not. She had a great bit of disdain for video games."
24-02-2018T23:32:05,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh
24-02-2018T23:32:18,Dadrobit,So I think she thinks that I was shouting at her in Latin or some shit.
24-02-2018T23:32:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Explains alot
24-02-2018T23:32:28,unsteddyphoenix,Pft
24-02-2018T23:32:40,unsteddyphoenix,"To be fair, you kiiiinda were?"
24-02-2018T23:32:52,Dadrobit,"Yeah, pretty much."
24-02-2018T23:33:05,unsteddyphoenix,"My friends gf WAS like that,  completely hated vidgames...now she's playing WoW and OW though so."
24-02-2018T23:33:44,TheBeckoner,"Filthy convert she is, no longer pure"
24-02-2018T23:34:15,unsteddyphoenix,Completely corrupted
24-02-2018T23:34:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll watch more than I’ll play. Unless it’s Mario Cart - then you better give me a controller
24-02-2018T23:34:33,Dadrobit,"She's probably still complaining about people wasting time on video games and being vegan. That is, unless the crushing depression and anxiety tore her soul to unrecognizable shreds."
24-02-2018T23:34:50,unsteddyphoenix,Which is very likely
24-02-2018T23:34:53,Dadrobit,Either or
24-02-2018T23:35:02,unsteddyphoenix,Wasting time being vegan?
24-02-2018T23:35:02,TheBeckoner,both is good
24-02-2018T23:35:24,Dadrobit,"Yes unsteddy, that exacty."
24-02-2018T23:35:52,unsteddyphoenix,Makes sense.
24-02-2018T23:35:59,unsteddyphoenix,Aint no TIME for vegetles
24-02-2018T23:36:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not opposed to vegans/vegetarians except when they rub it in your face
24-02-2018T23:36:37,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah they can get pretty holier-than-thou
24-02-2018T23:36:53,Dadrobit,"I was on a good health kick at the time with my kale shakes, so I more or less got a pass."
24-02-2018T23:36:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you shame me for eating meat, I will host a hot dog roast on your front yard"
24-02-2018T23:37:22,TheBeckoner,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xld8l4ANS9M

24-02-2018T23:38:38,Dadrobit,Also mildly adorable.
24-02-2018T23:38:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Sounds pretty good
24-02-2018T23:38:50,unsteddyphoenix,Ooo only mild

24-02-2018T23:39:04,Dadrobit,"But as someone who has lived with lots of baby chicks, those things crap /constantly/."
24-02-2018T23:39:19,Dadrobit,And that poor cat probably needs a bath now.
24-02-2018T23:39:33,TheBeckoner,True
24-02-2018T23:39:34,unsteddyphoenix,Thats a later problem
24-02-2018T23:39:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Have you ever seen a button quail chick?
24-02-2018T23:40:10,Ordithus,"No, but button quails are adorable"

24-02-2018T23:55:14,TheBeckoner,Night Ord.
