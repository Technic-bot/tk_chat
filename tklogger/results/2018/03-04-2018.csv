03-04-2018T00:28:08,Vatruvius,I liked the beige more but I think that is because it started to imprint itself on me. I have to not look...or all hell will break loose.

03-04-2018T00:29:30,Vatruvius,Don't get me wrong...the brown looks good. I think he was the beige for so long that I was just subconsciously planning on him staying that way.
03-04-2018T00:29:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,aww purple ears
03-04-2018T00:29:32,Ordithus,At least with this floppy ears he'll usually only get confused with Evals

03-04-2018T00:29:59,unsteddyphoenix,SHe looked very punkrock
03-04-2018T00:30:55,Vatruvius,I do not know...I did not get to see that. I am diggin this sandy blonde look though. Seems very fitting for her. I only know her name yet her character is developing in my head just by her hair color.
03-04-2018T00:31:21,Gelter,thats called stereotyping and it's usually bad
03-04-2018T00:31:26,iZute,Ah... earthbound... love that game...

03-04-2018T00:31:52,Vatruvius,I am not stereotyping at all...it has just been that color for a long time and I start to develope the character is all.
03-04-2018T00:32:02,Gelter,ok
03-04-2018T00:32:06,Ordithus,Color helps complete the image of the character.

03-04-2018T00:32:16,Notgoingtopostanything1,Nope

03-04-2018T00:32:47,Vatruvius,Don't think so Kiwi.
03-04-2018T00:32:48,Twokinds,Doesn't really fit her character to give her hightlights

03-04-2018T00:37:13,Vatruvius,I feel like this is not that complicated of a fur pattern...it is not like he has Kat spots or Flora stripes.

03-04-2018T00:48:49,KiTA,I just want to point out to anyone who missed that stream last year that Flora looks lewd as hell without her stripes

03-04-2018T00:49:49,unsteddyphoenix,Nah he just pushes the stripe button now
03-04-2018T00:49:49,Bgrmystr2,he's talking about a specific page

03-04-2018T00:50:17,KiTA,"yeah, Tom was drawing her and didn't do her stripes and it was like...  a gabillion times lewder than it should have been"
03-04-2018T00:50:18,Bgrmystr2,"it was one of the nora cards, I believe"
03-04-2018T00:50:29,KiTA,There was a few pages based on that too though
03-04-2018T00:50:32,Bgrmystr2,when flora was on the bed w/ trace
03-04-2018T00:50:34,KiTA,one where her stripes washed off which was funny
03-04-2018T00:50:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"when all else fails, Corgi"
03-04-2018T00:50:36,Bgrmystr2,a few pages were like that too
03-04-2018T00:50:46,KiTA,another where flora and kat swapped fur colors

03-04-2018T01:25:18,Twokinds,I immediately changed Colin's colors again after the stream
03-04-2018T01:25:39,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-katwet:

03-04-2018T01:25:54,unsteddyphoenix,Hey at least it'll be a surprise~
03-04-2018T01:27:02,Bgrmystr2,"yellow and purple polkastripe, marv"
03-04-2018T01:27:08,Bgrmystr2,obviously./
03-04-2018T01:27:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,of curse
03-04-2018T01:27:55,unsteddyphoenix,Ideally
03-04-2018T01:28:59,Twokinds,There's not enough colors to choose from.
03-04-2018T01:29:05,Twokinds,Photoshop really needs to add a new one.
03-04-2018T01:29:09,w0lfmare,Make a new color
03-04-2018T01:29:30,unsteddyphoenix,"only 3, what are we peasants?"
03-04-2018T01:29:49,unsteddyphoenix,A shrimp has more than that
03-04-2018T01:29:53,Bgrmystr2,xD
03-04-2018T01:29:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
03-04-2018T01:30:00,w0lfmare,Ink has 4 colors. A conspiracy?
03-04-2018T01:30:09,Bgrmystr2,yes
03-04-2018T01:32:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"Make him an obviously bright, unnatural color. And then never acknowledge it - not in the comic between characters or in real life"
03-04-2018T01:32:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Watch people implode from frustration
03-04-2018T01:33:33,unsteddyphoenix,You mean every anime ever?
03-04-2018T01:34:07,w0lfmare,"Don't recommend, everyone will think he's female Sonic"
03-04-2018T01:34:15,w0lfmare,... *Male
03-04-2018T01:34:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"XD, Colin is a sonic OC"
03-04-2018T01:34:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Doesn‚Äôt have to be blue
03-04-2018T01:35:25,Twokinds,I already did that with Trace
03-04-2018T01:35:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I thought that was just because he was powerful
03-04-2018T01:35:58,Dadrobit,What blue triangle
03-04-2018T01:36:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚ÄúSo full of energy, his hair is blue‚Äù"
03-04-2018T01:36:40,unsteddyphoenix,Confirmed Karen is equal power
03-04-2018T01:36:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Karen‚Äôs just radioactive
03-04-2018T01:37:31,SpazztasticKiwi,The energy leaks out in sporadic bursts
03-04-2018T01:38:15,unsteddyphoenix,"Personality traits: Happy, optimistic, unstable reactor-y"
03-04-2018T01:38:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Meeting the human equivalent of any of the characters would be a trip
03-04-2018T01:38:34,w0lfmare,XD
03-04-2018T01:39:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"not for lynn, that would just be a peaceful conversation"
03-04-2018T01:39:17,Dadrobit,"Plot Twist: You've already met Sirus, but you didn't know it because he's just that good."
03-04-2018T01:39:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"0,0"
03-04-2018T01:39:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve met some people who could be Karen.
03-04-2018T01:39:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Or just the human equivalent of a headache
03-04-2018T01:41:05,unsteddyphoenix,basically karen yeah
03-04-2018T01:41:45,Dadrobit,So I'm happy in ESO again. Turns out Razum-Dar lives even if you sacrifice him. He shows up a few quests later after he recovers and makes fun of you for trying to kill him.
03-04-2018T01:42:37,Dadrobit,All is well in the world \o/
03-04-2018T01:42:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,\o/

03-04-2018T01:42:56,unsteddyphoenix,Huh. Kind of trivializes the entire thing.
03-04-2018T01:43:09,Bgrmystr2,yeah kinda.
03-04-2018T01:43:13,Bgrmystr2,but
03-04-2018T01:43:18,Bgrmystr2,the feelbad was REAL
03-04-2018T01:43:20,Bgrmystr2,it wasn't fake.
03-04-2018T01:43:38,Dadrobit,"Yeah, a bit. But it's kind of a one off. A lot of the time when good NPCs die, it's for good."
03-04-2018T01:43:46,Bgrmystr2,aww
03-04-2018T01:44:04,Dadrobit,Raz  just deserves to live that much
03-04-2018T01:44:05,Bgrmystr2,he was too good to stay dead
03-04-2018T01:44:16,unsteddyphoenix,"But catte lived so, i'll accept it"
03-04-2018T01:45:43,Dadrobit,"""Are you surprised I'm alive? Because you tried to kill me? This one gets that a lot, people trying to kill him and then being surprised when it does not work."""
03-04-2018T01:45:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Imma try going to bed. Have fun with that
03-04-2018T01:46:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Night Tom night chat

03-04-2018T03:10:55,Twokinds,I think I've finally settled on a color scheme
03-04-2018T03:11:02,Twokinds,Though I'll have to see how I feel when I wake up tomorrow
03-04-2018T03:11:19,Dadrobit,Sleeping on it then.
03-04-2018T03:20:37,unsteddyphoenix,Wanna spoil it or?
03-04-2018T03:22:23,Bgrmystr2,ehh
03-04-2018T03:22:28,Bgrmystr2,why so spoil tho
03-04-2018T03:22:39,Bgrmystr2,the wait could make it better
03-04-2018T03:23:00,unsteddyphoenix,Eh
03-04-2018T03:23:09,unsteddyphoenix,Im a millenial and need instant gratification

03-04-2018T03:40:00,Bgrmystr2,spoilers!
03-04-2018T03:40:03,Bgrmystr2,I kinda figured that though
03-04-2018T03:54:09,Dadrobit,I feel so spoiled
03-04-2018T04:14:21,Twokinds,You know what's sad?
03-04-2018T04:14:39,Dadrobit,Yes?
03-04-2018T04:15:06,Dadrobit,But you probably have something different in mind.
03-04-2018T04:15:41,Twokinds,A thought I had while working on this was that I have to make the colors work for when someone inevitably requests a gender / sppecies swap of these two.
03-04-2018T04:16:01,iliar,@Twokinds On the clock 5 am. And have you started heating the bed yet?
03-04-2018T04:16:11,Dadrobit,That's a bit of a mind twist.
03-04-2018T04:16:29,Twokinds,I just did. I'm headed to bed soon.
03-04-2018T04:17:50,unsteddyphoenix,lmao
03-04-2018T04:17:53,unsteddyphoenix,thats aso
03-04-2018T04:18:00,unsteddyphoenix,so true
03-04-2018T04:18:01,Twokinds,"My concern now is that if she's blonde and he's a golden, they're both going ot look similiar when shifted."

03-04-2018T09:03:01,iliar,Yes. I uploaded it. But I can not publish it. Ido it soon
03-04-2018T10:08:20,Dadrobit,"Well, Nyx officially hates me."
03-04-2018T10:08:28,Dadrobit,Kitty needed a bath.
03-04-2018T10:08:35,Dadrobit,She just didn't know it.
03-04-2018T11:08:01,Vatruvius,Good morning everyone! :ptv-greetings:
03-04-2018T12:23:29,iliar,Good evening.
03-04-2018T13:23:28,TheBeckoner,Any battle wounds Robit?
03-04-2018T14:51:28,Vatruvius,Battle wounds? What was Dadro doing?
03-04-2018T14:52:14,TheBeckoner,bathing a cat if im correct
03-04-2018T14:56:04,Bgrmystr2,"rofl vatru, I find it funny that you join the chat literally right after the message that Beck responds to"
03-04-2018T14:56:14,Bgrmystr2,and you still dunno what he's responding to
03-04-2018T14:56:21,Bgrmystr2,did it not load?
03-04-2018T14:56:36,Bgrmystr2,did your page mess up? :v
03-04-2018T15:00:09,TorqueEmUp,How's everyone doing today?
03-04-2018T15:02:31,Vatruvius,I see it know. I read that last night but did not connect tge dots.
03-04-2018T15:03:01,Vatruvius,Good...making some fried potatoes for launch before I had to my night class.
03-04-2018T15:03:12,Vatruvius,Now* the*
03-04-2018T15:05:11,Vatruvius,"What is up with pets, cats and dogs alike, not likegetting wet/bathed. It is pratically a free body massage."
03-04-2018T15:07:51,TorqueEmUp,"Maybe they are like ""noooooo you ware washing away my smell!"""
03-04-2018T15:08:07,TorqueEmUp,are*
03-04-2018T15:08:46,Vatruvius,Maybe...but in my house clean dogs get 3x the lovings and peys...they love that part. Do they not put one and one together?
03-04-2018T15:08:55,Vatruvius,Pets*
03-04-2018T15:09:02,Bgrmystr2,no they don't lol
03-04-2018T15:09:03,Bgrmystr2,xD
03-04-2018T15:11:02,TheBeckoner,My dogs really hate baths until after then they go nuts with joy
03-04-2018T15:11:17,TheBeckoner,The pigs like baths all day long as long as it isnt too cold
03-04-2018T15:11:39,TheBeckoner,They hope up an twirl in the air when they get happy
03-04-2018T15:11:48,TheBeckoner,then fall because they have stub legs lol
03-04-2018T15:11:59,Vatruvius,lol
03-04-2018T15:12:06,TheBeckoner,hop*
03-04-2018T15:12:37,Vatruvius,"My dogs fet into play mode and ""look at me, I am all cute and clean"" mode after a bath."
03-04-2018T15:13:00,Vatruvius,get* Stop it phone! :ptv-angry:
03-04-2018T15:13:12,TheBeckoner,"Yeah, mine too. Almost like ""you just tortured me...now you owe me pets"""
03-04-2018T15:18:35,Vatruvius,"One of my dogs, Summer, has really thick hair. She is easy to wash but hard to dry. Thing is...when it is time to dry her she gets all wiggly and buries her face into the carpet making it very difficult. I am just like ""can't you see what I am doing..."
03-04-2018T15:18:54,Vatruvius,"...is more effective then what you are doing?"""
03-04-2018T15:20:03,Bgrmystr2,what you need to do is probably stop using towel and use something that dogs DO like.. maybe they'd be less reluctant
03-04-2018T15:20:57,Bgrmystr2,"dogs LOVE sticking their head out the window and feeling the air rush by, so I can only assume using a hair dryer would be decent, though they make a lot of noise and pets fear that"
03-04-2018T15:21:03,Bgrmystr2,so maybe a large heated fan
03-04-2018T15:21:06,Vatruvius,If it were up to them my dogs would dry themselves on the furniture...and that shit is expensive.
03-04-2018T15:21:29,Bgrmystr2,cuz they like rolling around on stuff
03-04-2018T15:57:41,JaydenMozingo,hello everyone
03-04-2018T15:58:16,TheBeckoner,Hello Jay
03-04-2018T15:58:34,JaydenMozingo,Hello Beck
03-04-2018T15:58:46,JaydenMozingo,How are you?
03-04-2018T16:04:37,TheBeckoner,"doin good, doin good. eatin jelly beans"
03-04-2018T16:06:48,JaydenMozingo,"Nice, nice. those would probably hurt my braces. One day... one day I'll be back to eating what I want..."
03-04-2018T16:07:38,TheBeckoner,Yeah braces were a pain. I tended to eat whatever anyway XD
03-04-2018T16:08:49,JaydenMozingo,Lol   popcorn isn't bad you just gotta be careful of the sharp parts of the interior
03-04-2018T16:09:14,JaydenMozingo,those'll get stuck and it hurts like a nut kick
03-04-2018T16:09:37,Bgrmystr2,I never had braces. Never wanted em. Screw that noise.
03-04-2018T16:10:48,JaydenMozingo,You're not missing out man. Tightening and removal are the worst parts
03-04-2018T16:11:40,JaydenMozingo,Painful a.f. if you tend to think about pain during the process
03-04-2018T16:29:23,TorqueEmUp,"Never had braces either. as long as your teeth aren't super fucked up, there is no point in them, it's all cosmetic."
03-04-2018T16:35:47,Vatruvius,"I got braces...not fun at all. Here I am 20 years old and my orthodontist installs a nonremovable wire and hands me a ""for tge rest of your life"" retainer. They do not tell you that when you start."
03-04-2018T16:40:58,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: and that's why I never got it.
03-04-2018T16:41:02,Bgrmystr2,because fuck some of that.
03-04-2018T16:41:12,Bgrmystr2,no.
03-04-2018T16:49:28,WIPKING,I got braces a month ago and all i get for easter is a water pick lol
03-04-2018T18:08:55,TheGamePlayer,Happy late Easter
03-04-2018T18:46:39,WIPKING,Y know i could be trace because my hair is blue but it needs to be longer on the sides
03-04-2018T19:39:31,Vatruvius,You would also need some balck magic scares and be a grand templar with a keidran tigress as your girlfriend.
03-04-2018T19:39:44,Vatruvius,black*
03-04-2018T19:40:09,Bgrmystr2,and a blue triangle.
03-04-2018T19:40:20,Bgrmystr2,the one he obviously wouldn't know about.
03-04-2018T19:46:47,Combak,... Why is your hair blue?
03-04-2018T19:47:25,Combak,"BTW, are you all waiting around in hope of a stream, expectation of one, or are you here for no good reason?"
03-04-2018T19:48:12,NightMeaty22,enters the chat
03-04-2018T19:50:33,Bgrmystr2,"You know I live here, so I'm kind of none of those."
03-04-2018T19:52:00,Combak,"You'd be ""No good reason"" Bgr"
03-04-2018T19:52:24,Zakuru,is here just in case
03-04-2018T19:55:53,Vatruvius,Just hanging it because it is fun.
03-04-2018T19:57:21,Bgrmystr2,"what a boring reply, Combak"
03-04-2018T19:57:51,Bgrmystr2,"is wanting to be here in case things happen, but hanging out to see who shows up no good reason?"
03-04-2018T19:58:04,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
03-04-2018T19:58:47,WIPKING,last July we went to go see DanTDM live we did my hair permanent blue instead of semi permanent so it's just been blue for a little while
03-04-2018T19:59:05,WIPKING,Vip boi
03-04-2018T19:59:27,WIPKING,230 dollors for him to sign a hat and pat me on the back
03-04-2018T19:59:37,WIPKING,Dollars*
03-04-2018T20:30:29,Vatruvius,Well...fuck.
03-04-2018T20:31:01,Vatruvius,My well pump just shot out snd I am out of water.
03-04-2018T20:32:15,Combak,Cistern system or groundwater?
03-04-2018T20:32:24,Combak,"Also, that sucks."
03-04-2018T20:33:17,Vatruvius,Hmm...never heard those technical terms but it is ground water...800ft down.
03-04-2018T20:36:03,Combak,Yikes. That'll have to be a PITA to fix.
03-04-2018T20:36:35,Combak,We have a cistern here. Have to get water trucked in occasionally. That why I asked.
03-04-2018T20:36:49,Combak,I think our pump went out once.
03-04-2018T20:39:38,Vatruvius,The pump has a lofe expectancy of 25 years...we bought the house 5 years ago and the pump was 28 years old.
03-04-2018T20:39:46,Vatruvius,life*
03-04-2018T20:40:52,Vatruvius,"It was bound to happen, it just really sucks that it is now."
03-04-2018T20:41:19,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
03-04-2018T20:41:22,Vatruvius,Life events are never convenient.
03-04-2018T20:44:43,Bigboi182,What is up my friends?
03-04-2018T20:45:31,Vatruvius,Out of water...gonna die of dehydration.
03-04-2018T20:45:58,Bigboi182,Go get it then.
03-04-2018T20:46:15,Bigboi182,Not like you're far away in the desert...
03-04-2018T20:48:24,Bigboi182,So how's everybody else?
03-04-2018T20:49:01,Vatruvius,lol...you should read above to see what I am talking about. Might as well be stuck in the dessert.
03-04-2018T20:49:25,Bigboi182,I just saw it...
03-04-2018T20:49:40,Bigboi182,You sound like you're in DEEP shit.
03-04-2018T20:49:54,Bigboi182,"Well, there's always bottled water..."
03-04-2018T20:51:35,Dadrobit,Back from class.
03-04-2018T20:51:52,Dadrobit,"And no, Nyx didn't scratch me up too bad."
03-04-2018T20:52:01,TheBeckoner,"Good, good."
03-04-2018T20:52:23,TheBeckoner,How are they holding up now?
03-04-2018T20:52:26,Dadrobit,"The claws were there, but she was just freaking out more than actually trying to hurt me."
03-04-2018T20:53:18,Dadrobit,And she became all happy and lovey again after her fur was mostly dry again.
03-04-2018T20:53:18,WIPKING,...
03-04-2018T20:53:37,Dadrobit,She's nice and smooth and fluffy now.
03-04-2018T20:53:41,TheBeckoner,That seems to be a normal pet response. *sad till dry*
03-04-2018T20:53:50,WIPKING,...
03-04-2018T20:54:17,WIPKING,Im changing my name
03-04-2018T20:54:42,NightMeaty22,hello
03-04-2018T20:54:58,Dadrobit,Tried using a blowdryer. That was a mistake.
03-04-2018T20:55:26,Dadrobit,She freaked the ever-loving hell out.
03-04-2018T20:55:28,TheBeckoner,Hah. I bet.
03-04-2018T20:55:36,NightMeaty22,what should i name this white cat i just got
03-04-2018T20:55:38,WIPKING,Nvm u cant
03-04-2018T20:55:44,TheBeckoner,Maybe a space heater would have been better?
03-04-2018T20:56:08,WIPKING,Or wind tunnel
03-04-2018T20:56:37,Dadrobit,A space heater?
03-04-2018T20:56:45,Dadrobit,Why would I ever get one of those.
03-04-2018T20:56:49,WIPKING,Lol
03-04-2018T20:56:51,TheBeckoner,oh yeah
03-04-2018T20:57:01,TheBeckoner,You're in Az?
03-04-2018T20:57:22,TheBeckoner,We have a couple here but only use them like twice a year lol
03-04-2018T20:57:33,TheBeckoner,They last forever that way tho
03-04-2018T20:57:55,WIPKING,Hosariconachotacocasadeamandillajones
03-04-2018T20:57:56,TheBeckoner,But I was suggesting it as a cat drying alternative.
03-04-2018T20:58:05,Dadrobit,"Also, you should name it Khione."
03-04-2018T20:58:33,Dadrobit,"Yeah, AZ. Never goes below like, 50 degrees."
03-04-2018T20:58:57,TheBeckoner,Dang. We were getting 15 degrees in Texas not to long ago
03-04-2018T20:59:12,TheBeckoner,like yesterday it was 85. THis morning it was 50 lol
03-04-2018T21:00:33,Dadrobit,"High of 91 today, currently 84."
03-04-2018T21:01:17,TheBeckoner,I either want hot or cold. Preferably hot. Just make up your mind whether..
03-04-2018T21:10:43,Bigboi182,Hot is much better.
03-04-2018T21:11:08,Bigboi182,"I've complained before, but after 3 days in Idaho, I change my mind..."
03-04-2018T21:11:23,WIPKING,What idaho
03-04-2018T21:11:30,WIPKING,Its warm here
03-04-2018T21:11:35,Bigboi182,It's been below 60 every. single. day.
03-04-2018T21:11:39,Vatruvius,I love semicold westher. Anywhere between 50 and 70 is good to me. I spent a semester in Tempe and I hated it
03-04-2018T21:11:56,WIPKING,What ever star was warm in the 60s
03-04-2018T21:12:33,Bigboi182,"If there's one thing a cold state does to you, is that it makes you better built for colder days in warmer climates."
03-04-2018T21:12:57,Bigboi182,"When people bring their sweaters when it's 75, i laugh at them."
03-04-2018T21:13:34,WIPKING,I wear acoat in school all day
03-04-2018T21:13:34,Bigboi182,"I tell them: ""you don't know the cold I've been through."""
03-04-2018T21:13:54,WIPKING,Crap now i have too dishes brb
03-04-2018T21:13:58,Bigboi182,I haven't worn a sweater to school in 3 years.
03-04-2018T21:14:12,Bigboi182,Cold states built me for that.
03-04-2018T21:22:05,Bgrmystr2,"Guess what though, big. It works both ways"
03-04-2018T21:22:15,Bigboi182,True.
03-04-2018T21:22:19,Bgrmystr2,when people come down here and melt in 95
03-04-2018T21:22:23,Bgrmystr2,I laugh at them too
03-04-2018T21:22:27,Bigboi182,It works that way for me though.
03-04-2018T21:23:04,Bigboi182,That's why so many northeners come to where i live.
03-04-2018T21:23:19,Bigboi182,It's much warmer.
03-04-2018T21:23:39,Bigboi182,Plus we've got water parks and good food and stuff...
03-04-2018T21:51:32,Bigboi182,I doubt that there's gonna be a stream today...
03-04-2018T21:51:53,Bigboi182,Or I could be wrong...
03-04-2018T21:52:05,Bigboi182,'Cause Tom's arrived...
03-04-2018T21:53:55,Bigboi182,"Ok, so no one's gonna reply then? That's cool."
03-04-2018T21:54:02,Bigboi182,I can wait...
03-04-2018T21:56:40,Vatruvius,No one cares about you Bigboi...only WIP.
03-04-2018T21:56:49,Bgrmystr2,noone cares about WIP either :v
03-04-2018T21:56:58,Vatruvius,:ptv-tease:
03-04-2018T21:57:07,Bgrmystr2,"also, it's already 11pm eastern"
03-04-2018T21:59:22,Vatruvius,I think he may do a page stream tomorrow if not on Friday.
03-04-2018T22:02:19,WIPKING,Wow bgr thanks
03-04-2018T22:03:07,WIPKING,A least im not impatient like big
03-04-2018T22:03:30,Bgrmystr2,"ahhaha, I don't hear Big complaining"
03-04-2018T22:03:35,Bgrmystr2,about Vatru's statement
03-04-2018T22:03:59,Bgrmystr2,"Also, who was the one who kept rechecking for a stream every 5 mins and asking constantly?"
03-04-2018T22:04:03,Bgrmystr2,wasn't big
03-04-2018T22:08:25,Bigboi182,Really guys?
03-04-2018T22:08:43,Bgrmystr2,naw

03-04-2018T22:15:25,Bgrmystr2,that's kinda your fault that you stayed up :P
03-04-2018T22:15:33,Bgrmystr2,"I say kinda, but it just is."

03-04-2018T22:48:04,Bgrmystr2,"it's ok, I'll tell you how delicious it is :V"
03-04-2018T22:48:11,Bigboi182,Wait a minute...
03-04-2018T22:48:20,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
03-04-2018T22:49:04,Bigboi182,It's still here.
03-04-2018T22:49:16,Bigboi182,We're good.
03-04-2018T22:49:23,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-tease: Aw damn, ya caught me."
03-04-2018T22:49:27,Bgrmystr2,I made my own pizza.
03-04-2018T22:49:40,Bigboi182,I bought mine from walmart.
03-04-2018T22:50:33,Bigboi182,There is literally no kitchen in here.
03-04-2018T22:53:10,Bigboi182,I'm still in a hotel.
03-04-2018T23:00:57,Bgrmystr2,why are you in a hotel?
03-04-2018T23:02:23,Bigboi182,I'm on vacation.
03-04-2018T23:02:44,Bigboi182,Faaaar away from where I live.
03-04-2018T23:02:50,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: But is it like.. Convention-class vacation?
03-04-2018T23:06:04,Bigboi182,yes.
03-04-2018T23:06:23,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-unimpressed: why do I not believe you
03-04-2018T23:06:58,Bgrmystr2,Do you bring money and make out like bandits buying all sorts of cool things?
03-04-2018T23:07:04,Bgrmystr2,or meet people you always wanted to meet?
03-04-2018T23:07:35,Bgrmystr2,"or have the possibility to spend all the money you're not supposed to, and hold back the urge and feel like a badass at the end of every day?"
03-04-2018T23:11:06,Bigboi182,no...
03-04-2018T23:11:53,Bigboi182,I'm here because my brother's been having issues and my family decided to come see him...
03-04-2018T23:12:13,Bgrmystr2,doesn't sound like a vacation to me.
03-04-2018T23:13:01,Bgrmystr2,"If it doesn't have all the things I described, it's not a convention-class vacation, and thus it is inferior. :P"
03-04-2018T23:13:01,Bigboi182,"If you've come from home nearly 3000 miles away, it's pretty much a vacation."
03-04-2018T23:13:11,Bgrmystr2,xD That's not a vacation
03-04-2018T23:13:52,Bigboi182,I haven't had the chance to really DO anything yet.
03-04-2018T23:14:00,Bigboi182,And I leave on Saturday.
03-04-2018T23:14:09,Bgrmystr2,"A vacation doesn't need to be far away. It simply needs to be a getaway. Even if just for a few days. To get away from job, work, stress, people, family, friends, anything you need to get away from."
03-04-2018T23:14:27,Bigboi182,"That's what I'm dooing, in a way..."
03-04-2018T23:14:31,Bigboi182,*doing
03-04-2018T23:14:35,Bgrmystr2,Doesn't sound like it
03-04-2018T23:15:48,Bigboi182,I'm bad at explaining...:sweat:
03-04-2018T23:16:27,Bgrmystr2,"Well, it's fine. I hope you have fun on your family visit. Just remember that not having a kitchen and not being able to make pizza with it is still a problem. :P"
03-04-2018T23:17:30,Bigboi182,Thanks man.
03-04-2018T23:17:57,Bigboi182,I'm just watching this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDCNJdeM9PE
03-04-2018T23:55:59,Vatruvius,Meh...I have to get up a half hour earlier then usual tomorrow because of the lack of water to take a shower in.
