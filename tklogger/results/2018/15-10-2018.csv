15-10-2018T12:37:21,MidNightBlue78,hello:ptv-snicker:
15-10-2018T12:38:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Surprised she didn’t try a bite of the candles
15-10-2018T12:38:57,Twokinds,Darn it
15-10-2018T12:39:01,Twokinds,"That's a good idea, wish I'd thought of it."
15-10-2018T12:39:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Admittedly I’m pretty sure I was asleep during that sketch and couldn’t throw in my two cents
15-10-2018T12:40:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"But if it gets colored, maybe you can just edit it"
15-10-2018T12:43:26,Foxpie,i mean if ya realy want to if its a quick change you could just edit it
15-10-2018T12:47:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"But that means editing it, taking down the first, & reuploading it"
15-10-2018T12:47:25,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s work
15-10-2018T12:49:46,Xexanoth,also it would assume that maeve isn't smart enough to know that candles aren't edible....
15-10-2018T12:50:29,SpazztasticKiwi,“These don’t taste good........must be fondant”
15-10-2018T13:21:11,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s something morbidly entertaining about watching Mark figure out feminine beauty products
15-10-2018T13:47:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I return with omelet bowl
15-10-2018T14:57:59,Bgrmystr2,"lol kiwi, that's silly. fondant may have a distinct sugar taste, but it's not even remotely wax xD"
15-10-2018T15:53:54,funnyman42,Hello everyone.  I have returned
15-10-2018T15:55:37,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
15-10-2018T16:20:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Your return is greeted by a Nibbly
15-10-2018T17:23:56,BadFoMo,"@Twokinds / @Xexanoth A little late, but thank you. My avatar will back to normal after Halloween."
15-10-2018T17:26:21,Mippy,:ctwokinds-nibsdance:
15-10-2018T17:30:44,SpazztasticKiwi,A dancing Nibbly. How fancy
15-10-2018T17:30:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"Mip, how’s your project progress going?"
15-10-2018T17:52:26,Mippy,Quite good actually. My pen project is going smoothly and I just spent almost all class doing the shadows for my egg drawing. I figured out how to make shadows look transparent.
15-10-2018T17:58:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Good work. Much progress. Wow :csagesaga-c4:
15-10-2018T17:59:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Cool you’re getting it done
15-10-2018T18:05:16,Mippy,Still a little worried though...deadline is on the 19th. How is Kiwi Land?
15-10-2018T18:09:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera decided a few minutes ago to sit on my chest
15-10-2018T18:09:28,Mippy,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA: I love cats
15-10-2018T18:10:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"And Kiwi’s new kibble came in, so she got to try it out"
15-10-2018T18:13:06,Mippy,Is it good kibble?
15-10-2018T18:13:16,Mippy,Have you tried it?
15-10-2018T18:14:07,SpazztasticKiwi,She had a treat before I poured her dinner portion so she didn’t eat much of it but it’s apparently better received than the other one she had
15-10-2018T18:16:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera is fussy cause I stopped pets
15-10-2018T18:18:50,Mippy,"That’s good, I know when I got Mister some dried meal worms to mix the in his regular food, he was all over it."
15-10-2018T18:20:09,SpazztasticKiwi,You have a reptile
15-10-2018T18:20:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a froggo
15-10-2018T18:21:35,Mippy,"You would think from what I said. Actually, Mister is a hedgehog. I like reptiles though."
15-10-2018T18:22:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I had a gerbil that ate mealworms. Not many know other critters eat em that don’t have scales
15-10-2018T18:24:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Peeka only eats mice though. Mealworms aren’t big enough
15-10-2018T18:55:27,Mippy,"Sorry, my mom just picked me up. Got some soap! Yeah, I did some reading when I first got Mister. He’s basically an omnivore."
15-10-2018T19:00:32,Xexanoth,"lot's of mammals are actually ""omnivores"""
15-10-2018T19:01:22,Xexanoth,even if they are primarily herb/carnivore
15-10-2018T19:20:44,SpazztasticKiwi,My cat won’t eat raw meat
15-10-2018T19:46:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Though to be fair both my cats are odd
15-10-2018T20:17:46,Twokinds,I am back from the store
15-10-2018T20:19:13,CrRAR,mission successful?
15-10-2018T20:19:27,CrRAR,food store?
15-10-2018T20:19:36,Twokinds,I returned with $200 worth of food.
15-10-2018T20:19:49,CrRAR,aww hell yeah
15-10-2018T20:21:59,CrRAR,endless choices in the cabinet on food shopping day is the best.
15-10-2018T20:23:36,Twokinds,"Yup, nothing like a full cupboard."
15-10-2018T20:33:50,Twokinds,Bad news: the grocery store has already started stocking egg nog.
15-10-2018T20:34:01,Twokinds,I fear for my health.
15-10-2018T20:34:28,Bgrmystr2,awww yee eggnog
15-10-2018T20:34:39,Mippy,"Yeah, I saw egg nog not too long ago...thought about getting some"

15-10-2018T21:02:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, yea now you have stuff to make a snack when you start wasting away"
15-10-2018T21:02:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"You know, as usual"
15-10-2018T21:04:14,SpazztasticKiwi,In other news YouTube is apparently down and half the people I follow are spouting off on Twitter about it
15-10-2018T21:04:15,Twokinds,Yep
15-10-2018T21:04:20,Twokinds,I noticed

15-10-2018T21:04:37,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah im noticing it now.
15-10-2018T21:04:42,Twokinds,"Speaking of technical difficulties, my pc just flickered ominously. I'm gunna restart."

15-10-2018T21:05:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"I just tried playing a video and though it’s not playing, some of the app is still displaying"

15-10-2018T21:06:00,Bgrmystr2,reloading youtube brings me to the main page as normal
15-10-2018T21:06:12,CrRAR,yeah youtube having a tough night apparently
15-10-2018T21:06:20,unsteddyphoenix,youre probably hacking
15-10-2018T21:06:38,Bgrmystr2,hax lol:ptv-condescending:
15-10-2018T21:06:39,CrRAR,I got many 500 error monkey screens
15-10-2018T21:06:52,CrRAR,MSoDs... to some
15-10-2018T21:07:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"Jack tweeted about 30 minutes ago so it’s been at least that long, though even then that may just be when he noticed"
15-10-2018T21:07:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I was on maybe an hourish ago
15-10-2018T21:07:12,CrRAR,sounds about right
15-10-2018T21:07:14,CrRAR,haha
15-10-2018T21:08:08,SpazztasticKiwi,YouTube went down and Tom’s having to restart his pc. Maybe Mark’s trying to take him down with him
15-10-2018T21:08:12,Bgrmystr2,ah there we go
15-10-2018T21:08:36,Bgrmystr2,I went to a new video on the front page of youtube and it says an error occured on the vide
15-10-2018T21:08:39,Bgrmystr2,video*
15-10-2018T21:08:48,Bgrmystr2,so I'm not 100% immune
15-10-2018T21:08:57,Bgrmystr2,less hax than usual.
15-10-2018T21:09:01,Bgrmystr2,Gotta up my game
15-10-2018T21:09:28,SpazztasticKiwi,My notifications and home page is showing but none of my folders and it seems my sub feed and video play is all down
15-10-2018T21:09:36,CrRAR,youtube new censorship engine must have a few bugs xD
15-10-2018T21:09:42,CrRAR,no videos for you
15-10-2018T21:09:43,SpazztasticKiwi,“Few”
15-10-2018T21:09:45,CrRAR,or you
15-10-2018T21:09:50,CrRAR,OR YOU
15-10-2018T21:10:04,CrRAR,ಠ_ಠ
15-10-2018T21:10:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe YouTube’s algorithm finally had enough of its own shit
15-10-2018T21:10:16,SpazztasticKiwi,“Guess I’ll die”
15-10-2018T21:10:55,CrRAR,Next workable screen you see on youtube:
15-10-2018T21:10:56,CrRAR,"""Please insert quarter"""
15-10-2018T21:11:19,CrRAR,"""A dollar for EXTRA funsies"""
15-10-2018T21:11:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"That happens, I’m no longer using yt"
15-10-2018T21:11:48,Bgrmystr2,I'm not paying them shit so
15-10-2018T21:11:51,Bgrmystr2,naw
15-10-2018T21:11:55,Bgrmystr2,pass for me
15-10-2018T21:12:02,CrRAR,haha
15-10-2018T21:12:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"If YouTube is down, why is my home screen refreshing"
15-10-2018T21:12:47,CrRAR,The twokinds server crew is most likely on the case
15-10-2018T21:12:56,Bgrmystr2,"is it the same videos every time, Kiwi"
15-10-2018T21:13:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"I think the better question is how was YouTube so broken that even when it’s broken, it’s broken"
15-10-2018T21:13:06,Bgrmystr2,"cuz if so, that's your browser cache"
15-10-2018T21:13:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m on mobile
15-10-2018T21:13:22,Bgrmystr2,phones have cache too
15-10-2018T21:13:32,Bgrmystr2,and they load all the video previews and text
15-10-2018T21:13:44,Bgrmystr2,"and when you watch a vid, it changes it all"
15-10-2018T21:13:59,Bgrmystr2,cuz it recalculates what it thinks you'd want to watch after each video.
15-10-2018T21:17:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"Love how in all the “is YouTube down for anyone else” mess on Twitter, it looks like only Sanders is carrying on as normal"
15-10-2018T21:18:37,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah the amount of people reacting is pretty funny
15-10-2018T21:19:08,unsteddyphoenix,Loooot of us were interrupted
15-10-2018T21:19:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Mass panic! YouTube is down!
15-10-2018T21:19:17,CrRAR,"I like how there's four odd dots in the top right corner of a blank yt page. Reminds me of the Keith ""..."" gif."
15-10-2018T21:19:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Yt hasn’t had its coffee yet
15-10-2018T21:20:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I hope it’s back before tomorrow though. I watch DeFranco on lunch sometimes
15-10-2018T21:21:45,Dadrobit,"YouTube has always been broken. Like a plane with an oil leak. ""If you see the plane is leaking oil, that's good, it means it still has oil. When it stops leaking, then you have a problem."""
15-10-2018T21:22:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"And if someone takes a smoke break instead of patching the leak, the problems gonna double"
15-10-2018T21:24:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera tried to meow and yawn at the same time
15-10-2018T21:24:31,Dadrobit,"On the brighter side of life, just got back from dinner with the grandparents. Had some Thai curry stuffs. Was exceptionally delicious."
15-10-2018T21:24:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"Ay, and Tom said he just returned from shopping for food stuffs too"
15-10-2018T21:25:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"Speaking of food, imma grab a snac"
15-10-2018T21:26:31,unsteddyphoenix,sounds deliciously exceptional
15-10-2018T21:28:30,Dadrobit,Had some spicy beef and broccoli in oyster sauce with calamari on the side. Was hard to not eat it all in one go.
15-10-2018T21:30:58,unsteddyphoenix,Youre not allowed to make me hungry after I just ate
15-10-2018T21:31:25,Dadrobit,Payback for the other night with you pan of meat.
15-10-2018T21:32:39,unsteddyphoenix,how dare you aptly justify yourself
15-10-2018T21:33:32,Dadrobit,"He who dares, wins."
15-10-2018T21:33:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Kids stop fighting or I’ll turn this car around
15-10-2018T21:34:26,Twokinds,holy carp
15-10-2018T21:35:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Well the fisch is back
15-10-2018T21:35:22,unsteddyphoenix,(I get it)
15-10-2018T21:35:34,Dadrobit,*Sad Trombone*
15-10-2018T21:37:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m proud of it anyway
15-10-2018T21:37:49,SpazztasticKiwi,But what happened Tom
15-10-2018T21:40:37,Twokinds,New photoshop update
15-10-2018T21:40:46,Twokinds,flipped canvas view
15-10-2018T21:40:48,Twokinds,Finally
15-10-2018T21:40:57,SpazztasticKiwi,So good carp
15-10-2018T21:41:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Thought your computer may have dumped files or something
15-10-2018T21:44:26,Dadrobit,"Pro Tools recently did a performance update. But they screwed something up that's seriously annoying. Any time I select a track item, it floats an inch below my cursor so I have reduced movement accuracy. Very very annoying."
15-10-2018T21:45:48,Twokinds,That does sound mighty annoying
15-10-2018T21:48:43,Dadrobit,It's actually the worst...
15-10-2018T21:49:17,Dadrobit,So many undo commands to try and fix the positionings.
15-10-2018T21:50:47,SpazztasticKiwi,YouTube’s back
15-10-2018T21:51:58,unsteddyphoenix,blessed be
15-10-2018T21:52:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Sanders Sides and the DeFranco show is saved
15-10-2018T21:52:31,Dadrobit,They better deliver a specialized apology to me for being down while I was enjoying dinner.
15-10-2018T21:53:58,SpazztasticKiwi,“We’re sorry a bit of technical problems ruffled your delicate feathers”
15-10-2018T21:54:35,Dadrobit,Turbo ruffled

15-10-2018T21:56:35,Ordithus,What did you do in the great Youtube outage of 2018?
15-10-2018T21:57:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Waste time here
15-10-2018T21:57:49,SpazztasticKiwi,And make a snac

15-10-2018T22:47:01,SpazztasticKiwi,But my other pun wasn’t well received so I figured I shan’t temp fate
15-10-2018T22:47:14,Bgrmystr2,that's not how you earn 1s :P
15-10-2018T22:47:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not out to “earn” approval from others
