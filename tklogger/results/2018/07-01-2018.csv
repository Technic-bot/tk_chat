07-01-2018T16:40:34,MidnightBlue78,"I'm doing well, thank you :ctwokinds-rainehappy:"

07-01-2018T16:41:52,Bgrmystr2,I just woke up about 40 mins ago-ish

07-01-2018T16:42:18,MidnightBlue78,hey Beegee :ctwokinds-traceflohug:

07-01-2018T16:42:33,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-SteelwormHades: hey midnight
07-01-2018T16:43:45,Twokinds,I'm thinking about testing Patreon's polling feature
07-01-2018T16:43:52,Twokinds,Just for fun.
07-01-2018T16:44:12,MidnightBlue78,"oh, they have a polling feature?"
07-01-2018T16:44:34,MidnightBlue78,Cool!
07-01-2018T16:44:42,Twokinds,Yeah
07-01-2018T16:45:09,MidnightBlue78,for everyone or patrons only?
07-01-2018T16:46:00,Twokinds,Just patrons so there's no cheating
07-01-2018T16:46:35,iliar,I think will be better use alternative voting system for color vote... but it's too difficult to organize
07-01-2018T16:46:59,Twokinds,"No, not for color voting. Just for fun."
07-01-2018T16:47:25,Twokinds,"The first question I have is ""Which character needs more love?"""
07-01-2018T16:47:32,Twokinds,With the options being secondary characters
07-01-2018T16:48:00,MidnightBlue78,"awww, but Im on a very low tier right now :ctwokinds-LauraCry:"
07-01-2018T16:48:12,MidnightBlue78,"I can't vote, right?"
07-01-2018T16:48:16,Twokinds,Well it doesn't matter what tier
07-01-2018T16:48:22,Twokinds,Could be 1 dollar
07-01-2018T16:48:34,funnyman42,cool
07-01-2018T16:48:42,Bgrmystr2,I can't vote RIP
07-01-2018T16:48:53,funnyman42,filthy peasent.
07-01-2018T16:48:56,funnyman42,lol
07-01-2018T16:49:00,Twokinds,My real goal is to find out which characters are underrated and draw them xD
07-01-2018T16:49:14,funnyman42,OOoooh!  I quite like that!
07-01-2018T16:49:15,MidnightBlue78,that's a really cool idea Tom
07-01-2018T16:49:22,Bgrmystr2,"Come back to me when you learn the value of money, Funnyman :vvvvvvvvv"
07-01-2018T16:49:31,MidnightBlue78,because we need some variety up in here
07-01-2018T16:49:41,Bgrmystr2,prolly a good idea tom
07-01-2018T16:49:59,MidnightBlue78,I'm on board with it :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
07-01-2018T16:50:01,Bgrmystr2,we already know who's popular
07-01-2018T16:50:24,funnyman42,Haven't seen much Clovis recently.
07-01-2018T16:50:28,funnyman42,or Lynn
07-01-2018T16:50:38,Twokinds,"Yeah, I mean we got 100+ sketches of Natani, but only 3 Lynns, 6 Adiras, etc."
07-01-2018T16:51:26,MidnightBlue78,"yeah, definitely we need to spread out the love more"
07-01-2018T16:51:41,MidnightBlue78,Now I'm excited
07-01-2018T16:52:53,funnyman42,I'd quite like to see Sealeen kissing Lynn.  :P
07-01-2018T16:53:18,MidnightBlue78,people ship Sealeen and Lynn?
07-01-2018T16:53:20,Twokinds,"Do you think ""Which character needs more love?"" is a good way to phrase it?"
07-01-2018T16:53:42,MidnightBlue78,"yeah,why not?"
07-01-2018T16:53:54,funnyman42,"Sure, just be sure to limit it (if possible) to characters with les than 20 pictures."
07-01-2018T16:53:56,Foxpie,"it get to the point of it, sould be fine"
07-01-2018T16:54:06,MidnightBlue78,"I mean,as long as you like it Tom"
07-01-2018T16:54:19,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: I mean, I can think of a few people that would definitely take it out of context somehow"
07-01-2018T16:54:23,MidnightBlue78,we all will know what you mean
07-01-2018T16:54:30,Bgrmystr2,you say that midnight
07-01-2018T16:54:38,MidnightBlue78,"oh yeah, some people are really extra"
07-01-2018T16:54:53,MidnightBlue78,might go all overboard
07-01-2018T16:54:58,Twokinds,I'm going to use characters who have less than 20 tags on Patreon
07-01-2018T16:55:15,funnyman42,:D
07-01-2018T16:55:38,MidnightBlue78,when are you planning this for Tom? If you don't mind me asking...
07-01-2018T16:57:40,Twokinds,right now
07-01-2018T16:58:22,MidnightBlue78,sweet!!!!!
07-01-2018T16:58:33,funnyman42,:ptv-excited:
07-01-2018T16:59:33,funnyman42,"Word of advice, NEVER order bacon on something from Pizza Hut."
07-01-2018T16:59:40,MidnightBlue78,I'm hyped!!!:ctwokinds-KatDance:
07-01-2018T17:00:03,Bgrmystr2,I've had meat lovers from Pizza Hut but I don't know if that includes bacon
07-01-2018T17:00:12,funnyman42,Second time in a row they loaded up my pizza with strips of chewy fat..
07-01-2018T17:00:13,Bgrmystr2,never had any problems though
07-01-2018T17:00:38,Bgrmystr2,isn't that bacon? It's either chewy or crisp
07-01-2018T17:00:40,funnyman42,"Blends in with the cheese, and is horrible."
07-01-2018T17:00:48,funnyman42,No
07-01-2018T17:01:16,funnyman42,"Bacon is supposed to have some meat in it, mostly fat, but still some.  not COMPLETELY fat."
07-01-2018T17:01:29,Bgrmystr2,xD
07-01-2018T17:01:36,MidnightBlue78,Pizza hut pizza is üëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèº
07-01-2018T17:01:59,funnyman42,It's okay.  Dominos and Papa Johns are pretty bad here too.
07-01-2018T17:02:17,MidnightBlue78,last time I had some it tasted like nothing at all
07-01-2018T17:02:19,funnyman42,Just wish they delivered Coke.
07-01-2018T17:02:41,funnyman42,Pepsi is for Communists who don't like Rum.
07-01-2018T17:02:46,Bgrmystr2,I had pizza hut recently-ish and it wasn't actually bad
07-01-2018T17:02:53,MidnightBlue78,order root beer instead
07-01-2018T17:03:04,MidnightBlue78,Or dr. Pepper
07-01-2018T17:03:06,funnyman42,BUT WHAT ABOUT MY RUM!
07-01-2018T17:03:17,funnyman42,"I like making mixed drinks,"
07-01-2018T17:03:29,Bgrmystr2,"I'll keep with my stweet tea thanks, you guys can keep your carbonated trash :D"
07-01-2018T17:03:32,MidnightBlue78,meh
07-01-2018T17:03:35,Bgrmystr2,sweet* even
07-01-2018T17:04:01,MidnightBlue78,"I like carbonated trash, thank you very much"
07-01-2018T17:04:09,MidnightBlue78,üòõ
07-01-2018T17:04:11,Bgrmystr2,Less for me = more for you
07-01-2018T17:04:15,funnyman42,"there's a particular brand of whiskey that I find to be pretty dangerous when mixed with ginger-ale though,"
07-01-2018T17:04:17,Bgrmystr2,Everybody wins.
07-01-2018T17:04:20,MidnightBlue78,YAY!!!!!
07-01-2018T17:04:38,MidnightBlue78,you know what's dangerous?
07-01-2018T17:04:39,Bgrmystr2,"For every single one I don't drink, that's one more you can potentially drink."
07-01-2018T17:04:45,MidnightBlue78,Crown Royal
07-01-2018T17:04:54,Bgrmystr2,pretty sure that's just a liquid
07-01-2018T17:04:59,Bgrmystr2,unless you try to drown in it
07-01-2018T17:05:02,Bgrmystr2,but that's all liquids
07-01-2018T17:05:16,Bgrmystr2,water would be dangerous too. :P
07-01-2018T17:05:17,MidnightBlue78,A neighbor I had made me a drink with that and sweet tea
07-01-2018T17:05:29,MidnightBlue78,"I swear, I was drunk for a whole week"
07-01-2018T17:05:40,MidnightBlue78,That shit fucked me up
07-01-2018T17:05:49,MidnightBlue78,pardon my language
07-01-2018T17:06:00,MidnightBlue78,I couldn't get up
07-01-2018T17:06:12,Bgrmystr2,NO :ptv-unimpressed: Give me more language. I like it.
07-01-2018T17:06:12,funnyman42,Anyone here had Pennsylvania Dutch?
07-01-2018T17:06:15,MidnightBlue78,I was bedridden
07-01-2018T17:06:48,Bgrmystr2,"I don't drink at all, myself, so I can't participate in this :v"
07-01-2018T17:07:08,MidnightBlue78,Crown Royal is made by satan himself I'm not even kidding
07-01-2018T17:07:18,Bgrmystr2,lol
07-01-2018T17:07:29,Bgrmystr2,do you not hold your liquor?
07-01-2018T17:07:31,MidnightBlue78,"I don't drink, I'm a good girl now :3"
07-01-2018T17:07:39,Bgrmystr2,that may be why
07-01-2018T17:07:53,MidnightBlue78,"not really, I am small, I get drunk very quick"
07-01-2018T17:08:01,Bgrmystr2,I've heard Crown Royal is generally for people who hold liquor better than others
07-01-2018T17:08:09,Bgrmystr2,but cannot confirm
07-01-2018T17:08:12,Bgrmystr2,don't want to either.
07-01-2018T17:08:20,MidnightBlue78,guess I didn't get the memo XD
07-01-2018T17:08:25,funnyman42,"Can confirm, a little......"
07-01-2018T17:08:37,MidnightBlue78,Ay sandunga!
07-01-2018T17:08:40,funnyman42,"that whole, being a sailor thing ant what not."
07-01-2018T17:09:08,MidnightBlue78,"the only thing I do like a sailor is swearing, that's about it"
07-01-2018T17:09:28,funnyman42,"Meet me in person, you ain't seen shit."
07-01-2018T17:09:54,funnyman42,I type without swearing a bunch just because I don't like to read it.
07-01-2018T17:10:12,funnyman42,"SPEAKING it and hearing it, totally different."
07-01-2018T17:11:58,funnyman42,"Anywho, Pennsylvania Dutch is an old fashoned Egg-Nog, whitch was made with Bourbon."
07-01-2018T17:12:40,Bgrmystr2,"you know.. It's funny for me, considering I live in one of the most popular and well-known places to drink"
07-01-2018T17:12:45,Bgrmystr2,and I don't drink at all
07-01-2018T17:13:09,Bgrmystr2,and that's not to mention the spicy food
07-01-2018T17:13:13,Bgrmystr2,which is the same story
07-01-2018T17:14:20,funnyman42,"I used to like spicy food.  Like, REALLY spicy food.  Then I went overseas and nearly died."
07-01-2018T17:14:36,funnyman42,:ctwokinds-katx_x:
07-01-2018T17:14:54,Bgrmystr2,"I can't stand spice, not even a little bit"
07-01-2018T17:15:17,Bgrmystr2,yeah overseas is more spice than food
07-01-2018T17:15:20,MidnightBlue78,but what does going oversees and almost dying have to do with spicy foods?
07-01-2018T17:15:25,MidnightBlue78,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
07-01-2018T17:15:36,Bgrmystr2,cuz asia puts like 900% more spice on everything
07-01-2018T17:15:37,MidnightBlue78,*Overseas
07-01-2018T17:15:43,funnyman42,Yeah
07-01-2018T17:15:45,funnyman42,.......
07-01-2018T17:15:45,MidnightBlue78,"Ah,makes sense"
07-01-2018T17:16:00,Twokinds,Aaaaaawwwwww
07-01-2018T17:16:03,Bgrmystr2,our spiciest shit is like.. plain compared to their spicy
07-01-2018T17:16:07,MidnightBlue78,Tom likes spicy and he's always getting stomach aches
07-01-2018T17:16:21,Twokinds,Patreon has a crummy poll limit
07-01-2018T17:16:23,Twokinds,And it's tiny
07-01-2018T17:16:26,Bgrmystr2,awww tom :(
07-01-2018T17:16:31,MidnightBlue78,That sucks
07-01-2018T17:16:34,Twokinds,20
07-01-2018T17:16:38,MidnightBlue78,I was all excited
07-01-2018T17:16:39,Twokinds,That's not enough
07-01-2018T17:16:49,MidnightBlue78,"so, no poll then?"
07-01-2018T17:16:51,Bgrmystr2,make two polls?
07-01-2018T17:16:56,Twokinds,no
07-01-2018T17:17:01,MidnightBlue78,awwwww
07-01-2018T17:17:10,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
07-01-2018T17:17:24,funnyman42,that sucks.
07-01-2018T17:17:28,MidnightBlue78,hopes and dreams crushed again...
07-01-2018T17:17:40,MidnightBlue78,:ctwokinds-sadtrace2:
07-01-2018T17:18:17,funnyman42,:ctwokinds-LauraCry:
07-01-2018T17:18:42,BadFoMo,"Well, we tried."
07-01-2018T17:18:54,MidnightBlue78,"yeah, I guess"
07-01-2018T17:19:02,MidnightBlue78,thanks for trying Tom
07-01-2018T17:19:09,Twokinds,I can do it if I make it just canon Twokinds characters with less than 15 tags on Patreon
07-01-2018T17:19:11,MidnightBlue78,much appreciated
07-01-2018T17:19:46,Twokinds,"That knocks off all non-twokinds, and Sythe, Mike, Maeve, Clovis and Nora"
07-01-2018T17:19:47,MidnightBlue78,"well, that's an alternative"
07-01-2018T17:20:04,MidnightBlue78,"dang, you can't leave those out"
07-01-2018T17:20:08,BadFoMo,Or do a poll on the fourms?
07-01-2018T17:20:15,Twokinds,They all have at least 15
07-01-2018T17:22:57,Bgrmystr2,"we know Nora doesn't gets too many votes, but she usually is a big hit when she does get the votes"
07-01-2018T17:23:03,Bgrmystr2,same with clovis
07-01-2018T17:24:10,unsteddyphoenix,What was the poll for?
07-01-2018T17:24:24,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, sythe and mike are the only two that seem side-character enough of those five to potentially be worth putting on the list"
07-01-2018T17:24:35,Bgrmystr2,"for side-characters that need more love, phoenix"
07-01-2018T17:25:40,Bgrmystr2,"is every single image on your patreon tagged with every character, Tom?"
07-01-2018T17:25:50,Bgrmystr2,cuz I seem to recall a few images that weren't tagged at all
07-01-2018T17:26:01,Bgrmystr2,but I dunno if you've gone back and changed that
07-01-2018T17:27:07,unsteddyphoenix,And the poll would be...which one Tom would draw or somethin'?
07-01-2018T17:27:09,Twokinds,I gradually try to fix any that aren't.
07-01-2018T17:27:37,Twokinds,"I can't tag some of the oldest, because they are before Patreon had a tagging system."
07-01-2018T17:28:08,Twokinds,"Also, Patreon's tagging system is weirdly limited too. You can only have 5 tags per post. I don't understand these strangely low limits on everything."
07-01-2018T17:28:54,Bgrmystr2,Yeah that makes sense
07-01-2018T17:29:49,Bgrmystr2,It may be better to use a 3rd party program to keep track of all the characters more accurately
07-01-2018T17:30:06,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I'd just use calc with open office, but yknow, I don't know any better :P"
07-01-2018T17:30:53,Bgrmystr2,I just like the grid setup
07-01-2018T17:31:40,Bgrmystr2,Though I'm not sure how to make it count names and etc
07-01-2018T17:31:50,Bgrmystr2,so :ptv-wondering:
07-01-2018T17:32:33,Twokinds,I wish Patreon had a gallery view
07-01-2018T17:32:36,unsteddyphoenix,Only 5 tags per post? How odd.
07-01-2018T17:32:45,unsteddyphoenix,Oooh me too~
07-01-2018T17:33:03,MidnightBlue78,hey unsteddy :ctwokinds-katdryer:
07-01-2018T17:33:19,Twokinds,Businesses seem obsessed with copying tumblr. I just want an easy way to see all my posts.
07-01-2018T17:33:56,Bgrmystr2,yeah tumblr isn't even remotely a good source for most things like that
07-01-2018T17:33:58,Bgrmystr2,"for some, sure"
07-01-2018T17:33:59,unsteddyphoenix,Odd choice since tumblr is a mess and im pretty sure is going downhill
07-01-2018T17:34:04,Bgrmystr2,yeah exactly
07-01-2018T17:34:13,unsteddyphoenix,Also hi~
07-01-2018T17:34:22,Bgrmystr2,Hey :ptv-greetings:
07-01-2018T17:34:41,BadFoMo,Make your own site?
07-01-2018T17:35:04,Azumachan,Hey
07-01-2018T17:35:09,BadFoMo,Hi.
07-01-2018T17:35:38,Twokinds,I could. That'd just be a ton of work.
07-01-2018T17:35:50,unsteddyphoenix,Lol just make your own!
07-01-2018T17:35:53,unsteddyphoenix,Easy!
07-01-2018T17:36:07,BadFoMo,Would the pay-off be worth it?
07-01-2018T17:36:11,Twokinds,There's over 500+ public posts
07-01-2018T17:36:30,Twokinds,I'd need to make thumbnails and link all of them to their respective Patreon post.
07-01-2018T17:36:36,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: THAT'S A LOT OF NU- POSTS
07-01-2018T17:36:37,unsteddyphoenix,"Hiring someone would be easier, but it might not be worth it."
07-01-2018T17:37:04,Twokinds,Hm...
07-01-2018T17:37:22,Twokinds,"Actually, yeah... I guess I could hire a freelance webdesigner to do it"
07-01-2018T17:38:03,unsteddyphoenix,Something to think about.
07-01-2018T17:38:16,unsteddyphoenix,Not like you have a shortage of accessable nerds
07-01-2018T17:38:45,Bgrmystr2,xD
07-01-2018T17:38:55,Bgrmystr2,unfortunately that leaves me out cuz I dunno how to do website coding
07-01-2018T17:40:15,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah backend is for smart people which I am not~
07-01-2018T17:40:19,funnyman42,"I know a bit, but I'd more be willing to help fund it."
07-01-2018T17:40:24,MidnightBlue78,Im pretty sure anyone that knows how would do it in a heartbeat
07-01-2018T17:40:47,Bgrmystr2,"I wouldn't have any problem doing it, I just don't actually know how"
07-01-2018T17:40:54,Bgrmystr2,I've got the time as well :(
07-01-2018T17:41:13,Bgrmystr2,rip lol
07-01-2018T17:41:32,MidnightBlue78,:ctwokinds-sadtrace2:
07-01-2018T17:45:49,MidnightBlue78,would it also be better if we donated directly to you instead of through patreon? I've been wondering about that for a while...
07-01-2018T17:46:56,Twokinds,"No, Patreon's fine. I makes things easy."
07-01-2018T17:47:06,MidnightBlue78,"Ah, ok :)"
07-01-2018T17:47:09,Twokinds,Plus I feel like people are getting something out of it for their trouble.
07-01-2018T17:48:26,MidnightBlue78,Understandable
07-01-2018T17:48:36,unsteddyphoenix,You never know when a wild policy change may appear though~
07-01-2018T18:02:24,Twokinds,Yeah it's scary
07-01-2018T18:05:30,Twokinds,I try to be smart and do my best to mitigate the risk.
07-01-2018T18:07:42,unsteddyphoenix,I think just being open about it is the best way
07-01-2018T18:37:00,Combak,Whatch'll talking about?
07-01-2018T18:37:13,Combak,*Whatcha'll
07-01-2018T18:39:00,MoonDance,Hello ^^
07-01-2018T18:39:22,Combak,Hi!
07-01-2018T18:42:40,BadFoMo,"I think we were talking about Patreon's voting thing, how it's very limited, and maybe making a new site for something."
07-01-2018T18:44:17,Combak,"Hmm, maybe..."
07-01-2018T18:44:20,Bgrmystr2,"Basically, tom wanted to make a vote to see what side characters need more love"
07-01-2018T18:44:48,Bgrmystr2,"Some of the posts don't have all the characters, some don't have any at all cuz pre-tag posts, etc"
07-01-2018T18:45:08,Bgrmystr2,and the poll itself was too limited by patreon
07-01-2018T18:45:42,Bgrmystr2,so we were discussing other ways to do it beyond patreon.
07-01-2018T18:48:05,MidnightBlue78,I hope it can still be done some way or another
07-01-2018T18:48:15,MidnightBlue78,at some point
07-01-2018T18:53:56,Combak,"Hmm... Well, I can offer one other way of information gathering, although it's probably fairly biased..."
07-01-2018T18:54:31,Combak,"... Actually, definitely strongly biased."
07-01-2018T18:56:47,TheBeckoner,Hello er body
07-01-2018T18:56:59,Combak,Hi.
07-01-2018T18:57:29,TheBeckoner,I would definitely like to see more Lynn stuff fwiw
07-01-2018T18:57:39,Combak,Indeed!
07-01-2018T18:57:56,Combak,Kat and Lynn really should have a conversation in the comic.
07-01-2018T19:10:07,unsteddyphoenix,what would they talk about? :ctwokinds-floraquestion:
07-01-2018T19:13:35,Twokinds,Kat sees Lynn's glasses and falls in love. Turns out she just has a thing for round specticles.
07-01-2018T19:14:15,MoonDance,It all makes sence
07-01-2018T19:14:44,MoonDance,*sense
07-01-2018T19:14:53,unsteddyphoenix,How long do I have to stare into the sun in order to need glasses
07-01-2018T19:14:56,unsteddyphoenix,Wait this isnt google
07-01-2018T19:15:04,unsteddyphoenix,oops
07-01-2018T19:16:13,Combak,Fertility.
07-01-2018T19:16:27,Combak,"Or rather, their lack thereof."
07-01-2018T19:18:21,BadFoMo,"NOOoo! I was shiping her with Zen! Ah well; I guess I need to start shiping Zen X Lilith, Lynn X Sealeen, and Kathrin X Clovis_Male."
07-01-2018T19:19:07,MidnightBlue78,glasses make some individuals look sexy and interesting :3
07-01-2018T19:19:28,MidnightBlue78,or is that just me?
07-01-2018T19:19:36,MidnightBlue78,:ctwokinds-katdryer:
07-01-2018T19:20:42,BadFoMo,Sketch request: Kathrin trying on Lynn's glasses? Lynn: Hey! I can't see without thoes!
07-01-2018T19:22:48,unsteddyphoenix,"They can be cute, sometimes, I guess?"
07-01-2018T19:22:50,Combak,"I never said I was shipping them, you know. I just thought that a conversation between them about that topic could be interesting. Seeing how they view the issue and how it impacts them could be interesting."
07-01-2018T19:23:19,BadFoMo,Oh...
07-01-2018T19:23:51,BadFoMo,...Can I still ship Kathrin X Clovis_Male?
07-01-2018T19:24:03,Combak,"I don't know, CAN you?"
07-01-2018T19:25:11,unsteddyphoenix,Does Clovis have different ships for each gender?
07-01-2018T19:25:28,Bgrmystr2,"probably, Phoenix"
07-01-2018T19:25:34,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, it's possible"
07-01-2018T19:25:40,Bgrmystr2,whether people do it or not is up to them.
07-01-2018T19:25:53,Bgrmystr2,Someone shipped Male Clovis with Female Clovis
07-01-2018T19:25:55,Bgrmystr2,so yes
07-01-2018T19:26:00,Bgrmystr2,is possible.
07-01-2018T19:27:38,Combak,"TBH, I'm pretty sure the only ship for Clovis is Clovis X Money."
07-01-2018T19:27:47,unsteddyphoenix,So what youre saying is it's impossible?
07-01-2018T19:28:22,Combak,"Who is ""you"" in that question?"
07-01-2018T19:29:30,Bgrmystr2,"likely you, combak xD"
07-01-2018T19:29:36,Bgrmystr2,"cuz otherwise, he wouldn't make any sense :P"
07-01-2018T19:29:43,Bgrmystr2,"but then again, phoenix never makes sense"
07-01-2018T19:29:46,Combak,He could've meant you!
07-01-2018T19:29:59,unsteddyphoenix,You think it makes more sense that I was referring to combak?
07-01-2018T19:30:05,unsteddyphoenix,The way you think is scary Bgr
07-01-2018T19:30:29,Bgrmystr2,"well yeah, I see zero reason to think you meant me"
07-01-2018T19:30:51,Bgrmystr2,unless you're just being you
07-01-2018T19:30:59,Bgrmystr2,then anything goes
07-01-2018T19:32:06,unsteddyphoenix,There are so many jokes that go over your head I imagine they get stuck in traffic :ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
07-01-2018T19:32:50,Bgrmystr2,I dunno? I see lots of jokes people make. They just aren't funny at all.
07-01-2018T19:32:54,Bgrmystr2,:u
07-01-2018T19:33:06,Bgrmystr2,"could be, though"
07-01-2018T19:34:21,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I'm not 12 anymore, so I don't think everything is funny anymore :P"
07-01-2018T19:36:33,MidnightBlue78,Beegee reminds me of grumpy old men
07-01-2018T19:36:52,MidnightBlue78,XD
07-01-2018T19:38:32,Bgrmystr2,you're welcome I guess? :ptv-wondering:
07-01-2018T19:44:30,TheBeckoner,&gt;The real reason Kat likes Eric is the glasses

07-01-2018T21:52:15,MrEase,Oh I know which one that is
07-01-2018T21:52:17,Twokinds,It's apparently a sketch called retcon but I don't remember it.
07-01-2018T21:52:27,MrEase,Its the one where you made Twokinds if Saria was still alive
07-01-2018T21:52:35,BadFoMo,The old idea about Saria not getting killed.

07-01-2018T21:54:11,Twokinds,Hm...
07-01-2018T21:54:20,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe Tom could get away with just colouring it without redrawing it?
07-01-2018T21:54:25,Twokinds,I'll have to ask the nora card owner if that's the one they want
07-01-2018T21:54:26,Dadrobit,That's the night folks.
07-01-2018T21:54:32,CrRAR,XD

07-01-2018T21:54:39,Twokinds,I don't want to start something if it turns out not to be it
07-01-2018T21:54:45,BadFoMo,I keep thinking that would have had Keith saving Laura from a Slave Sale.
07-01-2018T21:54:48,MidnightBlue78,true
07-01-2018T21:54:51,Ordithus,That would be a disaster
07-01-2018T21:54:54,unsteddyphoenix,There's other what-if scenarios after all.
07-01-2018T21:55:14,unsteddyphoenix,You'd think the card owners would link the ones the want when the request them
07-01-2018T21:55:22,unsteddyphoenix,Like...as common sense?
07-01-2018T21:55:34,CrRAR,Yeah where's the specificity~

07-01-2018T23:48:15,Twokinds,I'm in a weird place where the time requirement to take commissions is so great that it's prohibitively expensive for me to do them.
07-01-2018T23:48:15,Ordithus,Keenspot often has that problem....
07-01-2018T23:48:27,Dadrobit,does olive oil often partake in adultery?
07-01-2018T23:48:27,CrRAR,tru tru
07-01-2018T23:48:32,unsteddyphoenix,"Untrue, just charge $1000 per commission"

07-01-2018T23:48:46,Twokinds,"I'd have to charge a lot to make it worth it, but then I'd be stressed all the time in my head going ""This better be worth it"""
07-01-2018T23:48:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,he still would get sold out
