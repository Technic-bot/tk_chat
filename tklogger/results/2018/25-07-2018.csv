25-07-2018T03:10:12,Bgrmystr2,Hopefully I'll make it though
25-07-2018T12:48:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Sees you then
25-07-2018T13:59:19,Twokinds,Aw man
25-07-2018T14:07:28,TorqueEmUp,What's up?
25-07-2018T14:07:32,Twokinds,Someone requested Kat dressed as Lara Croft.
25-07-2018T14:07:44,Twokinds,Seems like a missed opportunity to ask for Laura Croft.
25-07-2018T14:11:24,TorqueEmUp,Well maybe they thought people just would'nt vote for just straight Lara Croft? ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
25-07-2018T14:13:04,TorqueEmUp,"But yeah, miss opportunity indeed"
25-07-2018T14:13:11,TorqueEmUp,missed*
25-07-2018T14:14:33,Twokinds,"Then again, Laura doesn't exactly have the bust to really pull it off XD"
25-07-2018T14:17:06,TorqueEmUp,"Ahh I misunderstood at first, now I gotcha. XP"
25-07-2018T14:25:02,TorqueEmUp,Doesn't mean Laura still couldn't try. :P
25-07-2018T14:25:50,TorqueEmUp,"Damn, now I would've liked to see that. lol"
25-07-2018T14:25:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"I feel it depends on if you use the triangle boobs vs round boobs design. My sister had the older game, and it seems she was smaller in those games"
25-07-2018T14:26:41,TorqueEmUp,Really? I remember her having the largest boobs in the PS1 era titles.
25-07-2018T14:27:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not sure what era it was. It just seems she was more A cup back then and now she‚Äôs almost a D
25-07-2018T14:28:15,TorqueEmUp,I think you got that backwards
25-07-2018T14:28:25,TorqueEmUp,because the current games she is not very big
25-07-2018T14:28:37,TorqueEmUp,but not small either
25-07-2018T14:28:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I haven‚Äôt looked at the current games. I have seen the actress for the movie tho. She‚Äôs cool
25-07-2018T14:29:15,Dadrobit,Have her stuff her chest with cardboard triangles.
25-07-2018T14:29:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Looks to be a good fit face and hair wise
25-07-2018T14:31:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚ÄúLaura‚Äù Croft, though may not have happened cause so many of us are obsessed with Kat. And wasn‚Äôt Laura a rather gentle, quiet character"
25-07-2018T14:32:13,TorqueEmUp,"Hell, I'll suggest ""Laura"" Croft if I have to. lol"
25-07-2018T14:32:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Puns all around
25-07-2018T14:33:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Like Eric as the Hanged Man. Though that‚Äôs not so much a pun as a sentence that‚Äôll get a ‚Äúrun that by me again‚Äù reaction
25-07-2018T14:36:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Kat Croft has a ring to it
25-07-2018T14:40:28,TorqueEmUp,"Bleh, I am done with Splatoon ranked right now. Game has an uncanny knack for letting you almost rank up, then constantly pitting you against unreal teams with idiot teammates."
25-07-2018T14:41:01,TorqueEmUp,My team having the idiots.
25-07-2018T14:43:24,TorqueEmUp,"Then again, most games with ranked battles go like that."
25-07-2018T14:47:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Main problem I have with multi player is variety. Nobody seems to want to be a healer or builder - they wanna plow in and destroy
25-07-2018T14:51:22,TorqueEmUp,Partially why I don't like playing those types of games. I prefer games where nobody is forced to play specific roles.
25-07-2018T15:01:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I like my little mobile sims
25-07-2018T15:21:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Cousin just popped the gender reveal of her 5th kid
25-07-2018T15:32:46,Dadrobit,"Be back in a bit, taking some kiddos to the aquarium."

25-07-2018T17:29:08,BadFoMo,Dang it. I missed something again! What was this about Laura?
25-07-2018T17:32:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom said there‚Äôs a suggestion for Kat as Lara Croft
25-07-2018T17:33:03,SpazztasticKiwi,He mentioned it was a missed opportunity for ‚ÄúLaura‚Äù Croft
25-07-2018T18:45:56,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-natsducky:
25-07-2018T18:51:04,Vatruvius,The puns run deep.
25-07-2018T18:51:07,Vatruvius,XD

25-07-2018T19:03:11,Vatruvius,All of it is great.

25-07-2018T19:04:27,Twokinds,You're welcome!
25-07-2018T19:05:57,Vatruvius,:ptv-hearts:
25-07-2018T19:13:12,Ordithus,It's a good one.  A bunch of us had been wanting to see it for a while!
25-07-2018T19:15:57,Vatruvius,"Yup, I don't even remember when the first time I suggested it was but I have been jumping between sketch suggestion from week to week so perhaps it took longer than it could have. XD"
25-07-2018T19:26:57,Ordithus,"Fortune cookie: ""You are the guiding star of his existence"" :ptv-confused::ptv-uneasy:"
25-07-2018T19:28:12,Vatruvius,:thinking:
25-07-2018T19:32:14,Ordithus,I'm going to assume it means platonically
25-07-2018T19:33:40,Vatruvius,"But, if it is a fortune cookie shouldn't it be ""their"" and not ""his"" because ""his"" implies that whoever got that particular cookie is female or homosexual?"
25-07-2018T19:36:45,Ordithus,It could be unrequited attraction
25-07-2018T19:38:24,Vatruvius,Hmm...
25-07-2018T19:46:20,Vatruvius,Time to update my sketch suggestion list...
25-07-2018T19:46:24,Vatruvius,Let's see here...
25-07-2018T19:47:01,Vatruvius,That one done...
25-07-2018T19:48:25,Vatruvius,Now which one to pick for next sketch stream...
25-07-2018T19:49:19,Xexanoth,pick the cutest one :)
25-07-2018T19:50:02,Vatruvius,Well...
25-07-2018T19:50:25,Vatruvius,"There is the Maren x Trace one, Keith x Laura, and Raine x Red."
25-07-2018T19:51:12,Vatruvius,I would say the Keith x Laura would be the cutest but all of them are nice.
25-07-2018T19:56:12,Ordithus,"As much as I like to see Maren, that implies crazy Trace.  I don't expect that would be cute..."
25-07-2018T20:01:37,Xexanoth,"when it comes to Awkward Cuteness, Red and Raine have that pretty much locked down..."
25-07-2018T20:02:24,Vatruvius,"It would be crazy Trace, but I do not know how Tom would depict him on a date. As much as he may be crazy, it is still about the date."
25-07-2018T20:02:49,Vatruvius,"As for Raine and Red, that is partially why I chose them for a sketch suggestion. That and I wanted human Raine so Red was the only candidate."
25-07-2018T20:04:31,Xexanoth,"yeah, people haven't really used the human Raine wiuth Sythe/zen for much"
25-07-2018T20:04:41,Xexanoth,would be something novel
25-07-2018T20:04:55,Xexanoth,kinda funny considering we had human raine x fur red
25-07-2018T20:04:57,Ordithus,Maren likes Raine's human form more.....
25-07-2018T20:06:36,Vatruvius,That is true.
25-07-2018T20:06:42,Ordithus,:ptv-shipit:
25-07-2018T20:06:57,Twokinds,:ptv-shipit:
25-07-2018T20:07:18,Vatruvius,I do not really mind human Raine x Zen/Sythe or something but it is just the scene for the date that I picked human all the way through.
25-07-2018T20:07:27,Vatruvius,"Tom is shipping it, it is official."
25-07-2018T20:07:41,Vatruvius,Human Raine x Fur Red is canon!
25-07-2018T20:07:50,SpazztasticKiwi,*shoves characters together* now kiss!
25-07-2018T20:07:51,Vatruvius,XD
25-07-2018T20:08:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Just like sims
25-07-2018T20:08:58,unsteddyphoenix,Pretty sure it's maren x raine that's now canon
25-07-2018T20:09:02,unsteddyphoenix,which

25-07-2018T20:10:04,Xexanoth,Guess Zen and Sythe are just gonna have to pair up then
25-07-2018T20:10:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Then what‚Äôs Red gonna do?
25-07-2018T20:10:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Himself?
25-07-2018T20:10:35,Ordithus,Kat
25-07-2018T20:10:44,unsteddyphoenix,red x femfur red?
25-07-2018T20:11:02,Ordithus,That level of self-love is reserved for Clovis
25-07-2018T20:11:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Red discovers gender-swapping mirror
25-07-2018T20:11:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Gets married
25-07-2018T20:11:19,Vatruvius,Oh my.
25-07-2018T20:11:24,unsteddyphoenix,true
25-07-2018T20:11:32,unsteddyphoenix,clovis x clovis is top tier ship
25-07-2018T20:11:53,SpazztasticKiwi,The shipping ship shipping ships
25-07-2018T20:12:18,Vatruvius,Shipception.
25-07-2018T20:12:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I have no doubt Clovis would find herself attractive
25-07-2018T20:12:55,SpazztasticKiwi,And then promptly scheme how to make that lucrative
25-07-2018T20:13:15,Xexanoth,We do have the sketch of him kissing himself
