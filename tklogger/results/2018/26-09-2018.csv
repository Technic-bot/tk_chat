26-09-2018T01:24:05,SpazztasticKiwi,These shots Mark‚Äôs gotten of this trip make me wanna hop on a plane
26-09-2018T09:52:53,Twokinds,My leg!
26-09-2018T09:53:25,iliar,What happened?
26-09-2018T09:53:39,Twokinds,A lot of wallking
26-09-2018T09:53:49,Twokinds,Up and down mountains
26-09-2018T09:56:18,iliar,Especially for you. It seems to me usually you rarely leave home.
26-09-2018T09:56:34,Twokinds,Very much so
26-09-2018T10:03:28,Twokinds,This trip has been amazing but I will be releaved to return home again to my boring drawing life XD

26-09-2018T10:42:58,iliar,Was it a tourist trip? I mean did you go to look at tourist attractions? Or just in their native places?
26-09-2018T11:45:20,TorqueEmUp,"I hope to one day be able to afford to leave the country. But at this point it looks like that will only happen if I win the lottery, or do it on someone else's dollar."
26-09-2018T11:46:34,TorqueEmUp,Leave the country on vacation I mean.
26-09-2018T12:29:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe this‚Äôll inspire you to go out more
26-09-2018T12:31:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Just without the mass exercise part of mountain climbing and walking maybe
26-09-2018T13:45:04,CrimsonQuill,Marmite
26-09-2018T14:54:54,Dadrobit,Mountain climbing is fun. Got a couple ranges nearby that are an absolute blast to go through.
26-09-2018T15:02:52,CrimsonQuill,"I'd just love to go mountain climbing. The highest I've ever been was on a mountian road 500m above sea level, with a few houses in sight down below."
26-09-2018T16:01:14,CrimsonQuill,"Oh-to everyone who reads this, don't expect to see my comments for a while-my Vol. 4 is finally shipping, so I'm taking a break from Twokinds to get myself ready for it, and I'll be off Picarto for a bit."
26-09-2018T16:01:33,CrimsonQuill,So all of you take care. Cheerio!:ptv-greetings::ptv-greetings::ptv-greetings::ptv-victory::ptv-victory::ptv-victory:
26-09-2018T16:01:45,CrimsonQuill,I will return.
26-09-2018T16:07:35,CrimsonQuill,Bye!
26-09-2018T17:38:00,Dadrobit,o/

26-09-2018T21:52:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder how wifi deprived Tom is
26-09-2018T21:53:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Seems he‚Äôs not getting but maybe ten minutes per rare visit
26-09-2018T21:54:03,Bgrmystr2,"he's probably mostly going out places during the day, and likely going to the family home and eat/sleeping I'd guess"
26-09-2018T21:54:24,Bgrmystr2,"according to Mark, the internet is spotty at best"
26-09-2018T21:55:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve seen. He‚Äôs gotten some gorgeous shots
26-09-2018T21:56:05,SpazztasticKiwi,That waterfall was üèÜ
26-09-2018T22:14:46,totallynotTrace,"hi, yeah Id love to see that waterfall in person too. that was Tom on the right side of the pic, right?"
26-09-2018T22:24:40,Ordithus,"There is no Tom, only Zuul (yes)"
26-09-2018T22:28:00,totallynotTrace,should i be sending the ghostbusters to korea?
26-09-2018T22:30:44,totallynotTrace,"it was funny, the first pic Mark posted (the one with Tiger from Winie the Pooh or whatever) I thought the guy behind mark was Tom and I was like ""wow thats not what i thought Tom would look like"""
26-09-2018T22:31:36,totallynotTrace,"then the waterfall pic and i was like ""Oh, yeah thats Tom"""
26-09-2018T22:33:27,SpazztasticKiwi,That one with Togger in the background just left me with questions
26-09-2018T22:33:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Tigger
26-09-2018T22:35:11,SpazztasticKiwi,That waterfall place looks straight up magic though
26-09-2018T22:37:42,totallynotTrace,theres a place about 20 miles drive from me that is the singularly relaxing place ever
26-09-2018T22:37:45,Ordithus,It is pretty
26-09-2018T22:38:39,totallynotTrace,but only for a few days a year when theres both no people and no mosquitos as it turns quite quickly into a mosquito pond & waterfall
26-09-2018T22:40:46,totallynotTrace,its this small state park in this tiny valley and you can climb into this tiny gourge that is about 5 ft wide x 10 long x 20-30 high
26-09-2018T22:41:20,totallynotTrace,but you have to climb up about six feet before then dropping 4 into it
26-09-2018T22:43:32,totallynotTrace,and the waterfall only pumps out probably 1-3 gallons a second so its not overpoweringly loud and one time I was hungry and stressed after school so i whent to subway and brought food there and luckilly no one was there cuz it was a week day and i just
26-09-2018T22:45:29,totallynotTrace,"sat on a tiny dry patch in this whole surrounded by boulders, and no one could see me and i couldnt see them and it was just me, my food, the waterfall, and chirping birds and the air smelled so clean and the trees were a beautifull full green cuz it was"
26-09-2018T22:45:33,totallynotTrace,mid spring
26-09-2018T22:45:44,totallynotTrace,i spent 3 hours there
26-09-2018T22:45:55,totallynotTrace,eating and meditating
26-09-2018T22:46:13,totallynotTrace,it was worth it
26-09-2018T22:46:28,totallynotTrace,the 20 mile drive that is
26-09-2018T22:47:00,totallynotTrace,anybody else wanna type a short essay to possibly no one in chat?
26-09-2018T22:49:21,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce: I'll pass
26-09-2018T22:49:57,Bgrmystr2,"same, big pass :tophat:"
