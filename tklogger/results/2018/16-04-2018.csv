16-04-2018T00:12:47,unsteddyphoenix,Close one?
16-04-2018T00:13:17,unsteddyphoenix,I don't get why they're doing another incredible s NOW
16-04-2018T00:13:47,unsteddyphoenix,it's been like 15 years
16-04-2018T00:19:16,Vatruvius,Because Disney bought em...gotta make that dough.
16-04-2018T00:23:15,unsteddyphoenix,Guess we'll all have to see it for nostalgia...they've really got us figured out.
16-04-2018T00:24:10,TheBeckoner,&gt;back
16-04-2018T00:24:35,TheBeckoner,Yeah I'm excited for the new incredibles
16-04-2018T00:24:50,TheBeckoner,gotta get lil bit of that mid childhood
16-04-2018T00:25:17,Bgrmystr2,"that movie still feels new to me, the first one"
16-04-2018T00:25:40,Bgrmystr2,yeah 2004
16-04-2018T00:25:48,Bgrmystr2,it came out after I moved here
16-04-2018T00:26:06,TheBeckoner,For being 14 it still does look pretty new
16-04-2018T00:26:45,TheBeckoner,My computer has just developed a squeek
16-04-2018T00:26:49,TheBeckoner,Im gonna die
16-04-2018T00:26:53,TheBeckoner,I cant find it
16-04-2018T00:27:20,TheBeckoner,Ok its gone...but it came and left on its own. which means itll be back...
16-04-2018T00:27:36,TheBeckoner,I hate tiny noises I cant find.
16-04-2018T00:28:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Me watching Instagram stories: “how can a human be so gorgeous”
16-04-2018T00:31:17,Bgrmystr2,"how does your computer develop a ""Squeek"""
16-04-2018T00:31:32,TheBeckoner,usually the souls of younger beautiful people kiwi
16-04-2018T00:31:33,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s got a mouse
16-04-2018T00:31:36,TheBeckoner,hah
16-04-2018T00:31:42,Bgrmystr2,the only thing that makes noise on a computer are physical moving parts.
16-04-2018T00:31:48,TheBeckoner,and not sure.
16-04-2018T00:31:50,Bgrmystr2,"hard drives, fans, etc"
16-04-2018T00:31:58,TheBeckoner,Its got a butt load opf fans so probably one of them
16-04-2018T00:32:02,TheBeckoner,of*
16-04-2018T00:32:26,TheBeckoner,Pretty sure its the 5 year old corsair cheapo deal
16-04-2018T00:32:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Thomas isn’t younger than me though. He’s 7 years older
16-04-2018T00:32:30,Bgrmystr2,yeah a fan will definitely sound different if it's not spinning as usual.
16-04-2018T00:32:47,Twokinds,Get off mah lawn ya darn kids!
16-04-2018T00:32:49,Twokinds,shakes cane
16-04-2018T00:32:55,SpazztasticKiwi,And he can shoot a story like a Disney movie
16-04-2018T00:32:57,TheBeckoner,Its fine though. give me an excuse to make them all noctua's
16-04-2018T00:33:04,BadFoMo,Start backing up files.
16-04-2018T00:33:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"Again, wrong Thomas"
16-04-2018T00:33:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Though you should really clean up under your bed it’s dusty down here
16-04-2018T00:34:33,Bgrmystr2,lol fomo.. a fan dying has nothing to do with needing to back up files
16-04-2018T00:34:46,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. there's a limit to how computer illiterate you can be xD
16-04-2018T00:35:17,Bgrmystr2,Hard drives don't make sqeeks when they have mechanical errors anyway
16-04-2018T00:35:31,TheBeckoner,I suppose if they all died it could overheat? but the radiator would still be enough on its own at idle I think
16-04-2018T00:35:49,Bgrmystr2,"they scratch, buzz, click, or just spin but don't function"
16-04-2018T00:36:01,TheBeckoner,The gpu doesn't even use its fans until sufficient load sooo
16-04-2018T00:36:11,Bgrmystr2,fans won't all die at once lol
16-04-2018T00:36:16,Bgrmystr2,and it won't be from overheat lol
16-04-2018T00:36:32,Bgrmystr2,it'll just be from mechanical failure in the fan components
16-04-2018T00:36:36,TheBeckoner,"yeah HD's are goin good so far. and Yeah ik i was just sayin ""if"""
16-04-2018T00:36:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"Besides, I am not a kid"
16-04-2018T00:37:01,Bgrmystr2,"if all the fans died, then yeah your pc could overheat if you've got a liquid cooling system"
16-04-2018T00:37:16,Bgrmystr2,cuz the fans are an important part of the radiator setup
16-04-2018T00:37:23,TheBeckoner,"Well it would still thermal siphon, and that may be enough"
16-04-2018T00:37:33,TheBeckoner,at ilde maybe
16-04-2018T00:37:37,BadFoMo,It's mostly a safety thing incase fixing the fan somehow breaks something else.
16-04-2018T00:37:41,Bgrmystr2,yeh if you're only doing like.. browser searching and stuff
16-04-2018T00:37:45,TheBeckoner,yea
16-04-2018T00:37:47,Bgrmystr2,"fomo, it doesn't work that way lol"
16-04-2018T00:37:59,TheBeckoner,Maybe if you have 10k rpm fans lol
16-04-2018T00:38:11,TheBeckoner,and a blade comes off
16-04-2018T00:38:14,Bgrmystr2,"10k rpm fans are crazy, but"
16-04-2018T00:38:26,Bgrmystr2,"if a blade comes off, then it won't be from fixing it that something else breaks"
16-04-2018T00:38:58,Bgrmystr2,and it's unlikely to pierce a hard drive shell
16-04-2018T00:39:13,TheBeckoner,I was mostly thinking the MB
16-04-2018T00:39:26,Bgrmystr2,yeah motherboard or the board of the GPU
16-04-2018T00:39:27,TheBeckoner,possible a non-backplate gpu
16-04-2018T00:39:33,TheBeckoner,yeah
16-04-2018T00:39:36,Bgrmystr2,most gpus don't have backplates
16-04-2018T00:39:38,TheBeckoner,possibly*
16-04-2018T00:39:40,Bgrmystr2,only really high tier ones do
16-04-2018T00:39:50,TheBeckoner,I try for backplated ones
16-04-2018T00:39:58,TheBeckoner,makes me feel better
16-04-2018T00:40:05,Bgrmystr2,you can buy backplates for ones that don't come with em
16-04-2018T00:40:05,TheBeckoner,they also seem to sag way less
16-04-2018T00:40:09,Bgrmystr2,it just doesn't really matter
16-04-2018T00:40:30,Bgrmystr2,"the sag is from the weight, backplate won't change that, if anything, it'll make it worse"
16-04-2018T00:40:39,Bgrmystr2,unless the backplate takes another slot on the back of the tower
16-04-2018T00:40:39,TheBeckoner,makes me feel nice when my 1080ti doesnt have a curve in it lol
16-04-2018T00:40:59,TheBeckoner,I meant the board of the gpu
16-04-2018T00:41:14,TheBeckoner,and yeah all the ones I have had have sagged from the slot
16-04-2018T00:41:16,BadFoMo,I was thinking along the lines of a the screwdriver sliping out of the screw and breaking one of the cercits.
16-04-2018T00:41:22,TheBeckoner,I just dont like the board to sag a tonm
16-04-2018T00:41:25,TheBeckoner,ton*
16-04-2018T00:41:28,Bgrmystr2,"my gpu doesn't curve at all, and it has no backplate xD"
16-04-2018T00:41:40,TheBeckoner,How long is it?
16-04-2018T00:41:43,Bgrmystr2,I guess it's cuz of the cooling system on it
16-04-2018T00:41:50,Bgrmystr2,"it's an 11inch, or 10.5, prolly"
16-04-2018T00:41:52,Bgrmystr2,one of the two.
16-04-2018T00:41:57,TheBeckoner,custom loop?
16-04-2018T00:42:12,Bgrmystr2,naw I don't use liquid cooling
16-04-2018T00:42:27,TheBeckoner,What's the cooling setup then?
16-04-2018T00:42:34,Bgrmystr2,I got a gpu with a superior cooling
16-04-2018T00:42:39,Bgrmystr2,"sec, lemmy grab a link"
16-04-2018T00:43:18,Bgrmystr2,https://www.msi.com/Graphics-card/N760-TF-4GD5OC.html
16-04-2018T00:43:28,Bgrmystr2,it's using a heatpipe design with twin fans
16-04-2018T00:43:38,Bgrmystr2,"it's a super solid card, doesn't bend at all"
16-04-2018T00:45:02,Bgrmystr2,way better cooling figures than the generic single fan cards that a lot of em came with
16-04-2018T00:45:12,TheBeckoner,Yeah MSI makes some good stuff. probably lighter than a 1080 too. mine bends at the slot but the card itself is perfectly straight
16-04-2018T00:45:13,TheBeckoner,https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA22A6S34510
16-04-2018T00:45:37,Bgrmystr2,"I plan to get an upgrade one day, but I don't need a $1000 card"
16-04-2018T00:45:48,Bgrmystr2,so I never upgraded past the 760
16-04-2018T00:45:53,TheBeckoner,"and its maybe a 5 mm drop front to back, not super noticable"
16-04-2018T00:46:18,TheBeckoner,I upgrade every like 4-5 years so i usually go to what is best for the tiime
16-04-2018T00:46:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll be on discord if anyone needs me
16-04-2018T00:46:41,Bgrmystr2,"that's a nice card, though it's a normal fin heatspreader.. ehh"
16-04-2018T00:46:46,Bgrmystr2,mkay kiwi :v
16-04-2018T00:47:14,Bgrmystr2,I don't upgrade unless I need it for what I'm doing on the pc. It's a waste of money otherwise.
16-04-2018T00:47:26,Bgrmystr2,I can use that on getting components that I do need.
16-04-2018T00:48:08,Bgrmystr2,like when my hard drive died a couple years back
16-04-2018T00:48:38,TheBeckoner,I just find myself getting slower around then. I had two 770's but nothing really does SLI and a single wasnt super great for the stuff i was playingf
16-04-2018T00:49:02,Bgrmystr2,"might just be how you use the pc, honestly"
16-04-2018T00:49:03,TheBeckoner,I've never had a hard drive die come to think of it
16-04-2018T00:49:14,Bgrmystr2,I've had a few
16-04-2018T00:49:25,Bgrmystr2,mostly cuz I run em hard
16-04-2018T00:49:33,TheBeckoner,Ive destroyed a couple tho
16-04-2018T00:49:41,TheBeckoner,the plates make good frisbees hah
16-04-2018T00:50:58,TheBeckoner,Also the card I link is full of heatpipes too
16-04-2018T00:51:21,TheBeckoner,well the one im looking at in my case does anyway...
16-04-2018T00:52:13,Bgrmystr2,"well, the one you linked doesn't in the images lol"
16-04-2018T00:52:16,Bgrmystr2,so :c
16-04-2018T00:52:31,TheBeckoner,hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
16-04-2018T00:52:37,TheBeckoner,oh whale
16-04-2018T00:53:44,TheBeckoner,Got my first REAL day of work tomorrow. There was a mix up with the managers or something...idk. hopefully all goes well.
16-04-2018T00:54:01,TheBeckoner,There's like 3 or 4 managers for this one place
16-04-2018T00:54:04,TheBeckoner,kinda weird
16-04-2018T00:54:04,Bgrmystr2,:v lucky you
16-04-2018T00:54:25,TheBeckoner,why me lucky?
16-04-2018T00:54:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Nobody’s doing anything interesting there
16-04-2018T00:55:05,TheBeckoner,where?
16-04-2018T00:55:15,TheBeckoner,slight confuse
16-04-2018T00:59:24,Bgrmystr2,you're lucky you got a day of work
16-04-2018T00:59:43,Bgrmystr2,I'm not quite as lucky as you
16-04-2018T01:03:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Discord
16-04-2018T01:03:50,SpazztasticKiwi,So I’m listening to YouTube music
16-04-2018T01:05:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Also Tom have you experimented with that wheat color yet
16-04-2018T01:07:18,TheBeckoner,Sorry to hear that Bgr. Recent development?
16-04-2018T01:08:52,Bgrmystr2,not even recent
16-04-2018T01:08:57,Bgrmystr2,quite a while actually
16-04-2018T01:09:39,TheBeckoner,Just sent you something interesting Kiwi...well what i would consider interesting.
16-04-2018T01:09:57,TheBeckoner,What was you job before? If you dont mind me asking
16-04-2018T01:11:33,Bgrmystr2,was a computer tech on multiple occasions. first one the entire business went under. The 2nd one I couldn't travel there and I didn't make enough to get any kind of vehicle
16-04-2018T01:12:10,Bgrmystr2,"I was at the first job for several years, I walked cuz it was closeby. the other one I had a ride for a few months, but yeh.. didn't last long"
16-04-2018T01:12:13,Bgrmystr2,"brb, pizza done :u"
16-04-2018T01:16:22,Bgrmystr2,back
16-04-2018T01:22:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Pretty cool idea
16-04-2018T01:22:12,TheBeckoner,Was the second close enough for a bicycle? probably not id guess
16-04-2018T01:22:34,TheBeckoner,The battery thing kiwi?
16-04-2018T01:22:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Yep
16-04-2018T01:23:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, random question: natural makeup look, no makeup, or regular makeup"
16-04-2018T01:23:34,SpazztasticKiwi,?
16-04-2018T01:24:07,Bgrmystr2,"naw, not even remotely close for a bike"
16-04-2018T01:24:28,Bgrmystr2,"and most the neighborhoods around the area weren't great, so bike theft was common"
16-04-2018T01:28:58,TheBeckoner,Dang. That sucks man. Hopefully you find something in your forte.
16-04-2018T01:29:40,TheBeckoner,No makeup kiwi? But thats hard to find in my experience so I'm good with a little makeup.
16-04-2018T01:30:54,Bgrmystr2,"I'm of the opinion that with proper upkeep and such, girls can look just as pretty with no makeup as they do with makeup"
16-04-2018T01:31:07,Bgrmystr2,"plus, a lot of times too much makeup makes em look so bad"
16-04-2018T01:31:22,Bgrmystr2,"also, how it's applied really matters, plus personal taste in the eye of the beholder ofc"
16-04-2018T01:31:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I like the art part of it
16-04-2018T01:31:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Mainly metallics
16-04-2018T01:32:03,Bgrmystr2,"but yeah I can appreciate someone that looks good with makeup, but honestly it kinda feels like they're just covering up what they feel they can't fix, or what they feel doesn't look good"
16-04-2018T01:32:07,Bgrmystr2,and I think that's kinda sad
16-04-2018T01:32:26,Bgrmystr2,"so finding someone who can look good without it, mucho respect"
16-04-2018T01:32:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don’t particularly like how I look though I don’t look awful, rather average"
16-04-2018T01:33:00,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's fair
16-04-2018T01:33:14,SpazztasticKiwi,But I look best with just a simple touch of a few things
16-04-2018T01:33:21,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, a little is fine"
16-04-2018T01:33:40,Vatruvius,Some make up is okay...when trying to look cute or whatever I see it going crazy from my sister. No need to look like a venetian godess or anything...but too much for just every day studd I cannot stand.
16-04-2018T01:33:41,Bgrmystr2,It's not like guys are too different. Not all guys like the beards and stuff
16-04-2018T01:34:06,Bgrmystr2,"gotta keep it trim, or go balls out and have an epic beard"
16-04-2018T01:34:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Beards & mustaches are fun to play with
16-04-2018T01:34:24,Vatruvius,Hey...I cannot help it! Darn thing grows back in 3 days!
16-04-2018T01:34:32,SpazztasticKiwi,So is long hair
16-04-2018T01:34:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Some girls gotta touch the floof
16-04-2018T01:35:10,unsteddyphoenix,Some
16-04-2018T01:35:12,Vatruvius,It is so strange to have a beard called floof...
16-04-2018T01:35:13,Bgrmystr2,my beard is super quick. It reaches maximum length within a week I guess.. but it's about an inch thick by then.. :u
16-04-2018T01:35:29,Bgrmystr2,"sometimes I just don't bother, sometimes I do"
16-04-2018T01:35:30,unsteddyphoenix,"My grandmother told me I looked like a ""bandit' the other day"
16-04-2018T01:35:37,Bgrmystr2,xD
16-04-2018T01:35:43,Vatruvius,An inch...that seems slightly unrealistic.
16-04-2018T01:35:49,unsteddyphoenix,Which I think means I need to shave and cut my hair~
16-04-2018T01:35:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I guess some guys do look better with while others need a monthly trim
16-04-2018T01:36:08,Bgrmystr2,"it may be about 3/4 inch vatru, but it's about that"
16-04-2018T01:36:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve seen some guys with long hair and hot damn
16-04-2018T01:36:20,unsteddyphoenix,I feel like I look silly with short hair personally.
16-04-2018T01:36:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Gotta do a double take
16-04-2018T01:36:25,unsteddyphoenix,But I know nothign about anything so
16-04-2018T01:36:42,Bgrmystr2,"hey, you can always double as that guy from game grumps, so"
16-04-2018T01:36:44,Bgrmystr2,np
16-04-2018T01:36:46,Bgrmystr2,:v
16-04-2018T01:36:55,Bgrmystr2,"body double has to be a job, right?"
16-04-2018T01:37:03,unsteddyphoenix,"Thats true, if he's sick one day i'll slide in"
16-04-2018T01:37:18,TheBeckoner,Danny?
16-04-2018T01:37:33,unsteddyphoenix,mhm~
16-04-2018T01:37:37,Bgrmystr2,yeh
16-04-2018T01:37:43,Vatruvius,My beard curls in on itself so my beard is super thick...it doesn't really grow out unless I wait for over a month and I just can live that long without triming the whole thing.
16-04-2018T01:37:44,unsteddyphoenix,If they ask me to sing it'll be problematic though...
16-04-2018T01:37:45,TheBeckoner,"I like longish hair, and girls seem to think curly hair is cute so i keep it a bit long"
16-04-2018T01:37:57,Bgrmystr2,"haha phoenix, I choose to believe."
16-04-2018T01:38:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"Not terribly attractive, Danny, but ok I guess"
16-04-2018T01:38:11,TheBeckoner,Your just sick that day
16-04-2018T01:38:14,TheBeckoner,youre*
16-04-2018T01:38:19,Bgrmystr2,"depends on how you look at 'im, Kiwi"
16-04-2018T01:38:21,unsteddyphoenix,\o/ tolerable woo~
16-04-2018T01:38:39,TheBeckoner,Danny is the sex god. what u mean
16-04-2018T01:38:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Waves and curls are pretty cool
16-04-2018T01:38:52,SpazztasticKiwi,If you wear them right
16-04-2018T01:39:12,TheBeckoner,"I wake up, wet my whole head and then proceed about my day lol"
16-04-2018T01:39:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Can’t cover those eyes though
16-04-2018T01:39:26,TheBeckoner,nah thats annoying
16-04-2018T01:39:27,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s where I look first
16-04-2018T01:39:45,TheBeckoner,I hate hair in my eyes
16-04-2018T01:39:56,unsteddyphoenix,I think thats where a lot of people look first...
16-04-2018T01:40:04,Bgrmystr2,the eyes? Prolly girls
16-04-2018T01:40:08,Bgrmystr2,guys look elsewhere
16-04-2018T01:40:11,Bgrmystr2,commonly..
16-04-2018T01:40:17,unsteddyphoenix,I have no idea what youre implying
16-04-2018T01:40:19,TheBeckoner,hah...yea
16-04-2018T01:40:20,unsteddyphoenix,(shhhh)
16-04-2018T01:40:32,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno phoenix, it's just one of those things they say."
16-04-2018T01:40:40,TheBeckoner,I usually go to the face first though if im honest
16-04-2018T01:41:06,SpazztasticKiwi,And who’s a sucker for a good smile
16-04-2018T01:41:12,unsteddyphoenix,I feel like the face is still most important
16-04-2018T01:41:18,Bgrmystr2,Where else would we look other than the eyes? :u
16-04-2018T01:41:38,Vatruvius,Smiles are nice but I do not think I have a photogenic smile.
16-04-2018T01:41:52,Vatruvius,Was not part of the cards.
16-04-2018T01:42:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I once saw a photo of a guy with a surprised smile on his face (a sneaked candid photo)
16-04-2018T01:42:50,SpazztasticKiwi,99% Cupid hit me for a minute
16-04-2018T01:42:58,SpazztasticKiwi,*sure
16-04-2018T01:43:32,TheBeckoner,I had stupid expensive braces at one point...my smile better be damn perfect for the money lol
16-04-2018T01:43:42,TheBeckoner,probably isnt
16-04-2018T01:43:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you make a girl stop and recheck, you have her attention"
16-04-2018T01:44:11,TheBeckoner,Not sure Ive ever done that
16-04-2018T01:44:22,Vatruvius,I got braces...my teeth look good but my smile just is not photogenic.
16-04-2018T01:44:29,Bgrmystr2,xD
16-04-2018T01:44:49,Dadrobit,Back for a hot second.
16-04-2018T01:45:06,unsteddyphoenix,All second are hot when youre here~
16-04-2018T01:45:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Get a room you two
16-04-2018T01:45:26,Dadrobit,D'awwww~
16-04-2018T01:46:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom you still alive?
16-04-2018T01:46:56,Dadrobit,"Speaking of getting a room, my grandma is wanting to hit up New Zealand sometime later this year/early next year. Any places you'd consider ""must see""?"
16-04-2018T01:47:13,SpazztasticKiwi,If he says “my bedroom”...
16-04-2018T01:47:26,unsteddyphoenix,I mean...
16-04-2018T01:47:34,Dadrobit,I'd be disappointed if he didn't.
16-04-2018T01:47:46,SpazztasticKiwi,*heavy sigh*
16-04-2018T01:47:49,unsteddyphoenix,Your grandma DOES sound pretty cool
16-04-2018T01:48:18,Vatruvius,New Zealand...visit Hobbiton?
16-04-2018T01:48:30,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah thats not bad
16-04-2018T01:48:59,Dadrobit,I actually showed her those old photos and she started freaking out a little over how much her tattoos had grown since then.
16-04-2018T01:49:00,unsteddyphoenix,Solid general pick
16-04-2018T01:49:27,unsteddyphoenix,"""I dont remember half of these! Theyre spreading!"""
16-04-2018T01:49:41,Vatruvius,When they did tge Hobbit movies they changed the houses from faceds to real houses with interiors...at least Bag End anyway.
16-04-2018T01:50:09,unsteddyphoenix,Weta workshops pretty cool if you can get a tour
16-04-2018T01:50:20,Vatruvius,Yeah.
16-04-2018T01:50:38,unsteddyphoenix,Oh and there's this WW2 museum near to that that's really sweet.
16-04-2018T01:50:48,unsteddyphoenix,made by weta workshop people
16-04-2018T01:50:57,unsteddyphoenix,"As someone who hates learning, it was really cool"
16-04-2018T01:50:57,Dadrobit,"Ohhh, that I could see her really digging."
16-04-2018T01:51:11,Vatruvius,"Or buy it and live there...that would be cool too. ""Where do you live?"" ""Ohh...Hobbiton, New Zealand."""
16-04-2018T01:51:23,Dadrobit,She remembers the latter years of the war.
16-04-2018T01:52:07,Dadrobit,Most vividly the phone call her mother got telling her that it was over and that daddy was coming home of course.
16-04-2018T01:53:04,unsteddyphoenix,Aw~
16-04-2018T01:56:22,TheBeckoner,Mustve been one great call for her mom.
16-04-2018T01:56:52,TheBeckoner,A lot of relief I would imagine.
16-04-2018T01:57:12,Dadrobit,"Yeah, iirc the story properly, her mother picked up the phone and suddenly burst into tears."
16-04-2018T01:57:37,Dadrobit,"And she went to her mother wanting to know what was wrong, but everything turned out right."
16-04-2018T02:03:24,TheBeckoner,Aw man im tired...
16-04-2018T02:03:29,TheBeckoner,Alright
16-04-2018T02:03:36,TheBeckoner,Goodnight y'all
16-04-2018T02:03:46,Dadrobit,"Right on, have a good one, Beck."
16-04-2018T02:03:57,Dadrobit,I think I may do the same here in a bit.
16-04-2018T02:04:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Think I’m off too
16-04-2018T02:05:32,Dadrobit,"Have a good one, Spazz."
16-04-2018T02:05:44,Bgrmystr2,"Ah, okay. Gnight everyone goin to sleep."
16-04-2018T02:06:00,Bgrmystr2,Leavin me all by my lonesome with the phenoix :ptv-uneasy:
16-04-2018T02:06:19,Bgrmystr2,and maybe some lurkers
16-04-2018T02:07:26,Vatruvius,Yes and no. I am getting off soon too.
16-04-2018T02:31:42,unsteddyphoenix,all~ by~ my ~ self~
16-04-2018T02:32:15,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering:

16-04-2018T02:34:37,unsteddyphoenix,:OOOOO
16-04-2018T02:34:43,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-ohmy::ptv-excited:
16-04-2018T02:35:04,Bgrmystr2,atm I'm just watching the OVAs of High School Fleet
16-04-2018T02:35:10,Bgrmystr2,was okay.
16-04-2018T02:35:21,unsteddyphoenix,is that like boats?
16-04-2018T02:35:23,unsteddyphoenix,boat girls?
16-04-2018T02:35:31,Bgrmystr2,naw that's like.. Kantai collection
16-04-2018T02:35:33,unsteddyphoenix,Ive seen boat girls and I dont understand it at ALL
16-04-2018T02:35:44,Bgrmystr2,yeah that's the mecha musume genre
16-04-2018T02:35:56,Bgrmystr2,"girls being like.. mechanical stuff, tanks, boats, planes, etc"
16-04-2018T02:36:13,Bgrmystr2,all those anime are based on the designs of one guy
16-04-2018T02:36:15,Bgrmystr2,so yknow
16-04-2018T02:36:32,Bgrmystr2,this one is more like.. girls actually taking real ships to sea
16-04-2018T02:36:44,Bgrmystr2,"so it's not quite the same, but similar."
16-04-2018T02:37:25,unsteddyphoenix,weird!
16-04-2018T02:38:52,Bgrmystr2,"yeah the ship girls kinda thing is strange, but"
16-04-2018T02:39:07,Bgrmystr2,the strike witches and other stuff makes more sense imo
16-04-2018T02:40:01,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. what kinda girl has the strength to carry battleship-calibur guns and all that ammo and etc etc.. does she control it with her mind or what
16-04-2018T02:40:54,Bgrmystr2,at least with strike witches they carry actual weapons which aren't gonna be too heavy
16-04-2018T02:41:21,Bgrmystr2,"but it's all kinda the same genre, so :thinking:"
16-04-2018T03:13:28,unsteddyphoenix,Anime strength op
16-04-2018T03:13:32,unsteddyphoenix,I bet a basitin could
16-04-2018T03:15:24,Bgrmystr2,Possibly.
16-04-2018T07:07:09,MalinSharpPaw,"Heh, imagined all twokinds main characters on the board of Weatherlight. It looks well"
16-04-2018T07:41:39,DRAGONTANOPUG,Morning
16-04-2018T07:51:25,MalinSharpPaw,Evening
16-04-2018T14:59:25,SpazztasticKiwi,How do I tell if I got the print
16-04-2018T14:59:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll just see when it gets here
16-04-2018T15:11:43,Bgrmystr2,you told yourself when you ordered the thing whether it came with the print
16-04-2018T15:11:45,Bgrmystr2,cuz it was a choice.
16-04-2018T15:11:56,Bgrmystr2,"if you don't know what you chose, go back to what you bought"
16-04-2018T15:39:12,Twokinds,"There's four options in the dropdown, two include prints."
16-04-2018T15:39:24,Twokinds,"Check your reciept if you're unsure, it should say print if you selected it."
16-04-2018T15:43:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m convinced my phone hates me some days
16-04-2018T15:43:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll fix it
16-04-2018T15:55:46,SpazztasticKiwi,This does remind me I need to reorder some more mice for Peeka
16-04-2018T16:04:31,Twokinds,Peeka?
16-04-2018T16:04:38,BluePhantom90,hey all
16-04-2018T16:07:33,SpazztasticKiwi,My Pac man frog
16-04-2018T16:10:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t talk about her as much cause she doesn’t do much
16-04-2018T16:10:44,SpazztasticKiwi,And you said you don’t like frogs
16-04-2018T16:17:46,Twokinds,Aaaaaah froooogs
16-04-2018T16:18:40,BluePhantom90,"Hey Tom I have come up with a funny sketch idea, but might be a small comic page idea... Would you like to hear it?"
16-04-2018T16:18:50,Twokinds,Maybe
16-04-2018T16:19:07,SpazztasticKiwi,And my frog has teeth
16-04-2018T16:22:15,BluePhantom90,"Well the sketch idea is. "" King Adelaide mid life crisis, she decides to have another child"" ( the only joke to it is all the males ""western, and eastern"" vanish when she mentions the idea)"
16-04-2018T16:33:27,Twokinds,lol
16-04-2018T16:34:03,Twokinds,I could see that
16-04-2018T16:34:06,Vatruvius,Tos an idea...
16-04-2018T16:34:12,Bgrmystr2,abandon shippppppppp :ptv-shock:
16-04-2018T16:34:12,Vatruvius,Tis*
16-04-2018T16:36:24,BluePhantom90,"More like the Western and Eastern Basitin's made a peace treaty if such idea occurs. They have a secret cave to meet in. I mean I would put the idea in the Sketch post but feel like you would just run with the ""mid life crisis"" idea only"
16-04-2018T16:37:57,BluePhantom90,anyways I will save that on the sketch idea list
16-04-2018T16:39:35,DRAGONTANOPUG,Im back from school! =)
16-04-2018T16:39:40,BluePhantom90,wb
16-04-2018T16:43:45,BluePhantom90,"seemed like it would be a small comic with the King mentions the idea, Then all the male guards replace themselves with stick guards"
16-04-2018T16:44:38,BadFoMo,Warning. Possable spam incoming. Pls don't ban/kick.
16-04-2018T16:45:08,BadFoMo,"Speaking of sketches, which should I start requesting next? ‘Kathrin and Eric turned into Nagas due to a magical accident.’,..."
16-04-2018T16:45:33,BadFoMo,"...‘Maeve and Maddie bury Keith and Natani at the beach and fashion Merfolk tails for them. A wave then washes away the sand revealing actual Merfolk tails!’,..."
16-04-2018T16:45:50,BadFoMo,"...‘A heavily pregnant Flora takes bandages similarly enchanted to the ones that Natani uses to put her belly on someone else. (Artist’s choice as to who that will be.)’, ‘Kathrin goes crazy with the ‘Magic Pen’ and gives Trace, Eric and Daniels tails!’.."
16-04-2018T16:46:05,BadFoMo,...or ‘Trading Halves Sequel. Flora and Trace finding out that they're going to be parents! (Natani and Keith's reaction to the news somewhere in the background?)’
16-04-2018T16:46:07,Bgrmystr2,aaaa the wall :v
16-04-2018T16:46:26,BadFoMo,Sorry.
16-04-2018T16:46:43,BluePhantom90,I liked the Magic bandage idea with Flora
16-04-2018T16:51:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"There’s a bird nest on my grandma’s porch, and she’s already laid her eggs in it despite the fact the nest is only half done"
16-04-2018T16:51:35,SpazztasticKiwi,“Eh good enough”
16-04-2018T16:51:50,BadFoMo,"@BluePhantom90 I think I'm leaning towards the Merfolk one, but who do you think would/should get Her belly?"
16-04-2018T16:53:00,BluePhantom90,"you said ""artist choice"" but I think Nat. Just so Lynn gives the evil look at Keith."
16-04-2018T16:53:04,Vatruvius,Natani! :P Wakes up one morning with a belly...
16-04-2018T16:53:59,BluePhantom90,Keith got Nat pregnant with Lynn: Keith I believe we need to talk!
16-04-2018T16:55:06,Vatruvius,Basitin cannot mate with Keidran either can they?
16-04-2018T16:56:16,BluePhantom90,"-shrugs- thats Tom's domain, But they did do one with Nat getting pregnant with her saying ""It's okay Nat, We are different species Nat"""
16-04-2018T16:57:22,Vatruvius,Wait...one where Keith and Natani...when?
16-04-2018T16:57:28,BadFoMo,https://www.turaiel.me/twokinds/images/Pregnant%20Natani.jpg
16-04-2018T16:57:38,DRAGONTANOPUG,Lol
16-04-2018T16:57:40,BluePhantom90,yep that one
16-04-2018T16:57:46,DRAGONTANOPUG,Its possible
16-04-2018T16:58:26,Vatruvius,That is an old sketch.
16-04-2018T16:58:35,Vatruvius,But still funny.
16-04-2018T16:58:57,DRAGONTANOPUG,In the comic Eric States keidran only get pregnant after a week after being in heat.... Flora had sex with trace soon after her heat.....
16-04-2018T16:59:04,DRAGONTANOPUG,Possible...
16-04-2018T16:59:19,BluePhantom90,Well If a human and Keidran can have a child. Then who knows with Basitin and Keidran
16-04-2018T17:00:52,DRAGONTANOPUG,It should be possible...
16-04-2018T17:00:54,Vatruvius,Flora and Trace had a child because Nutral allowed that mix race to happen again...it was not just convenient timing though it was for Nuetral.
16-04-2018T17:01:03,DRAGONTANOPUG,Tom knows
16-04-2018T17:02:05,DRAGONTANOPUG,@Twokinds its possible right......
16-04-2018T17:02:30,Twokinds,Nope. Impossible
16-04-2018T17:02:55,Vatruvius,So Nuetral only allowed human x keidran?
16-04-2018T17:03:04,Twokinds,They're different species.
16-04-2018T17:03:28,Twokinds,Basitins can have children with humans though.
16-04-2018T17:04:02,Vatruvius,Huh...humans are the go between.
16-04-2018T17:04:11,BluePhantom90,So how did Euchre and Mary work out?
16-04-2018T17:04:23,Twokinds,"That was a joke, btw"
16-04-2018T17:04:30,BluePhantom90,lol knew it
16-04-2018T17:04:35,Twokinds,Euchre had a child with Mary because he was fully human at the time.
16-04-2018T17:04:38,BadFoMo,Humans! We can do anything!
16-04-2018T17:04:44,Twokinds,Two humans can have children. Obviously.
16-04-2018T17:05:01,Vatruvius,I hope so...
16-04-2018T17:06:20,BluePhantom90,hmmm But its by magic and yet Euchre can't sustain Human form for long. So does he still have the Regular years as a Keidran to live
16-04-2018T17:06:47,Twokinds,He can be human as long as he wants. It's his special talent.
16-04-2018T17:07:06,BluePhantom90,then why shift back?
16-04-2018T17:07:07,Twokinds,"Some special character have special, unique abilities that belong to them."
16-04-2018T17:07:32,BluePhantom90,ah plot device. lol
16-04-2018T17:07:43,Twokinds,"No, that's the whole reason WHY they're master Templar."
16-04-2018T17:07:52,Twokinds,Each one has a special ability they can use whenever they want.
16-04-2018T17:08:15,BluePhantom90,hmm
16-04-2018T17:08:27,Vatruvius,Hmm...then what is Trace's special ability? :ptv-wondering:
16-04-2018T17:08:45,Twokinds,"He's not a Master Templar. He's a Grand Templar, and he got it by taking over."
16-04-2018T17:08:51,Twokinds,"Like, by force. It's in the story."
16-04-2018T17:09:41,Vatruvius,Ohh...so he is just strong/organized the over throw.
16-04-2018T17:10:00,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: sometimes I wonder who actually read the comic
16-04-2018T17:10:23,BluePhantom90,lol I did. Sometimes its nice to get a refresher.
16-04-2018T17:11:46,Vatruvius,I tead it 8 times Bgr and I know he over threw and became Grand Templar...I just did not know that Master Templar have abilities where as Grand Templars do not.
16-04-2018T17:11:53,Vatruvius,read*
16-04-2018T17:12:07,Bgrmystr2,mhm
16-04-2018T17:12:50,Twokinds,"They could, it's not like it's a job requirement."
16-04-2018T17:13:02,Twokinds,"""Hey what is your unique"""
16-04-2018T17:13:16,Bgrmystr2,xD
16-04-2018T17:13:19,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Watch TOM, will make natani leave when the comic ends cause kieth can have son."
16-04-2018T17:13:52,Vatruvius,Only the best of grammar.
16-04-2018T17:13:53,Twokinds,Keith can have son
16-04-2018T17:13:59,BluePhantom90,Well I mean Trace used a imperfect Transformation spell on Mary Silverlock. Which made me question could they create a imperfect memory erase spell or memory erase spell.
16-04-2018T17:14:44,Bgrmystr2,"""create"" an imperfect spell? You do realize that ALL spells are going to be imperfect until they're perfected, right?"
16-04-2018T17:15:11,Bgrmystr2,"if possible to perfect, that is"
16-04-2018T17:15:28,DRAGONTANOPUG,He can just not with natani.
16-04-2018T17:15:51,DRAGONTANOPUG,But i guess still she was just with then for her brother zen.....
16-04-2018T17:15:53,SpazztasticKiwi,End of the story is everyone gets a kid and lives happily ever after (except Red. He becomes everyone’s nanny)
16-04-2018T17:15:59,DRAGONTANOPUG,Lol
16-04-2018T17:16:03,Bgrmystr2,lol poor red
16-04-2018T17:16:33,Vatruvius,^
16-04-2018T17:17:06,DRAGONTANOPUG,Well i guess keith and nat can adopt a baby
16-04-2018T17:17:09,Twokinds,I am very hungry.
16-04-2018T17:17:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Make dinner
16-04-2018T17:17:31,Twokinds,I had a tiny amount of oatmeal for breakfast and that's it.
16-04-2018T17:17:32,DRAGONTANOPUG,Icecream taco?
16-04-2018T17:17:44,SpazztasticKiwi,And don’t say “can’t -diet”
16-04-2018T17:17:51,BluePhantom90,I mean Euchre had Perfect Transformation. And Trace used the Imperfect spell on Karen
16-04-2018T17:17:59,BluePhantom90,those ears of hers
16-04-2018T17:18:06,DRAGONTANOPUG,No no
16-04-2018T17:18:26,DRAGONTANOPUG,No more transgender crap
16-04-2018T17:18:48,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Only ""twokinds"" of genders."
16-04-2018T17:18:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"Dieting will only get you so far in loosing weight. Unfortunately, you gotta move too"
16-04-2018T17:18:55,BluePhantom90,What? what are you talking about
16-04-2018T17:19:00,Bgrmystr2,"noone said anything about that, dragon"
16-04-2018T17:19:11,Bgrmystr2,prolly should stop talkin to the wall :P
16-04-2018T17:19:14,Twokinds,Can't - diet
16-04-2018T17:19:21,Vatruvius,lol
16-04-2018T17:19:23,SpazztasticKiwi,You did that on purpose
16-04-2018T17:19:26,Bgrmystr2,well yeah
16-04-2018T17:19:29,Twokinds,"Also, not true. If you don't eat, you'll eventually lose all your weight."
16-04-2018T17:19:35,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Oh thot he somthin about it, i read to fast"
16-04-2018T17:19:47,SpazztasticKiwi,But it’ll require you metabolism too
16-04-2018T17:19:53,SpazztasticKiwi,*rewire
16-04-2018T17:19:56,DRAGONTANOPUG,After you die
16-04-2018T17:19:59,Twokinds,lol
16-04-2018T17:20:16,Twokinds,"I was implying death, yes."
16-04-2018T17:20:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"As soon as you start eating normally again, you’ll regain that weight"
16-04-2018T17:20:31,SpazztasticKiwi,You’re too young to die
16-04-2018T17:20:34,Twokinds,But your metabolism can only go so low. There's a minimum amount of energy you need just to live.
16-04-2018T17:20:37,Bgrmystr2,"xD If you don't eat, your body transforms your muscle mass into fat.. so you gain some weight.. then eventually you burn that off and then die :P"
16-04-2018T17:20:39,DRAGONTANOPUG,I actually felt starved after not eating for 2 days
16-04-2018T17:20:42,Vatruvius,Unfortunately...body fwt foes not have all the nutrients you need to survive. You will lose weight and lose the body fat but not without attrifing too.
16-04-2018T17:20:46,DRAGONTANOPUG,For the first time
16-04-2018T17:20:50,Twokinds,"As long as you're eating under your passive calorie buring, you'll lose weight."
16-04-2018T17:21:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Granted it’s different for men vs women
16-04-2018T17:21:33,DRAGONTANOPUG,Today I learned that cigarettes have more than just nicotine in them
16-04-2018T17:21:41,DRAGONTANOPUG,Its got more crap
16-04-2018T17:21:58,Bgrmystr2,lol why would you think it's only made of one thing
16-04-2018T17:22:06,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Like car engine fluid, and pesticides"
16-04-2018T17:22:20,DRAGONTANOPUG,I thought it was just tabacco
16-04-2018T17:22:31,DRAGONTANOPUG,Buring tabocco
16-04-2018T17:22:39,DRAGONTANOPUG,Tabocco*
16-04-2018T17:22:44,Vatruvius,Your basal metabolic rate Tom.
16-04-2018T17:22:47,DRAGONTANOPUG,Nvm spellinh
16-04-2018T17:22:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Why so suddenly invested in loosing weight now? Doctor pestering you?
16-04-2018T17:23:10,Bgrmystr2,"the convention, kiwi"
16-04-2018T17:23:13,DRAGONTANOPUG,Nah
16-04-2018T17:23:20,DRAGONTANOPUG,The convention
16-04-2018T17:23:22,Twokinds,"Eh, just for fun."
16-04-2018T17:23:31,DRAGONTANOPUG,To feel good.
16-04-2018T17:23:36,SpazztasticKiwi,In what universe is dieting fun
16-04-2018T17:23:43,Bgrmystr2,Tom's
16-04-2018T17:23:44,Bgrmystr2,obviously
16-04-2018T17:23:48,Twokinds,"It's not healthy to be overweight. Plus, it saves money on food."
16-04-2018T17:23:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Weirdo
16-04-2018T17:24:03,Bgrmystr2,"It's not weird in tom's universe, kiwi"
16-04-2018T17:24:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I gotcha
16-04-2018T17:24:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I lost my weight to feel better
16-04-2018T17:25:30,Twokinds,Yeah. Right now I'm 180. I'd like to be 170 or so.
16-04-2018T17:25:33,DRAGONTANOPUG,"I weigh a mighty 140, mostly muscle."
16-04-2018T17:25:37,SpazztasticKiwi,And to get the doctors off my back
16-04-2018T17:25:52,DRAGONTANOPUG,Not that it runs in the family
16-04-2018T17:25:56,SpazztasticKiwi,“You’re almost considered obese. It be good for you”
16-04-2018T17:26:07,SpazztasticKiwi,*it’d
16-04-2018T17:31:27,Vatruvius,Why am I so much heavier than everyone else? I am not that overweight. I guess I have more muscle mass than the average guy? That would explain a few things...
16-04-2018T17:35:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Fat/muscle balance is different for everyone - even using a height & age chart as a guide is more of a guideline than a rule book
16-04-2018T17:37:22,Vatruvius,I have to say...I have significantly broader shoulders that every guy I see...most of tgem anyway.
16-04-2018T17:37:32,Vatruvius,than*
16-04-2018T17:37:41,Vatruvius,them*
16-04-2018T17:39:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Broad or square shoulders can give you the advantage of looking fit
16-04-2018T17:42:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Can make you come off as more intimidating too
16-04-2018T17:43:47,Vatruvius,I do wear my weight well...however there is no way I look intimidating unless someone feels that...that or they are a perv/ass that should feel intimidated by me.
16-04-2018T17:44:42,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s more than true. A creep tends to back off if another guy not in his group enters
16-04-2018T17:45:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Had a group of guys calling at me once at my old job. Coworker rounded the corner for a drink refill and they suddenly got very interesting in their food
16-04-2018T17:47:21,Vatruvius,Yeah...I have the build structure where if you were thinking of doing anything wrong like harrasment or rape...you would definitely decide otherwise if I were in eyeshot.
16-04-2018T17:48:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a friend that I consider a brother. He’s over 6 feet and terrifying at first sight
16-04-2018T17:49:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m trying to see if he’d like to join me at MomoCon
16-04-2018T17:49:36,Vatruvius,MomoCon?
16-04-2018T17:50:04,SpazztasticKiwi,In Atlanta. But he might be working
16-04-2018T17:50:52,Vatruvius,What is MomoCon?
16-04-2018T17:51:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Comic book/anime convention
16-04-2018T17:51:15,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Jusy relized that my mom lets me get vanoss merch and not tk stuff, and she says vanosw is cruel"
16-04-2018T17:51:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t know if I want to go one day or invest in all four
16-04-2018T17:52:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’d be kinda lonely alone, but if he or my other friend ends up not being able to go"
16-04-2018T17:52:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Conventions are better with a group of friends
16-04-2018T17:53:24,Vatruvius,You go to a lot of events. In the last three weeks you sae Jack...then went to Pax...saw Ethan...now MomoCon.
16-04-2018T17:53:35,Vatruvius,saw*
16-04-2018T17:54:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"They were all close by except PAX, and I had the money saved up for that already"
16-04-2018T17:54:38,SpazztasticKiwi,And Ethan and Jack were both at PAX. I only saw Mark and Jack outside of that
16-04-2018T17:55:14,SpazztasticKiwi,At their tours
16-04-2018T17:56:51,Vatruvius,Hmm...
16-04-2018T17:57:30,Dadrobit,"Heading to a con this weekend, don't think I'm gonna be able to write it of on my taxes though unfortunately."
16-04-2018T17:57:34,Dadrobit,ZapCon
16-04-2018T17:57:47,Twokinds,Momocon? I've been there!
16-04-2018T17:57:51,Dadrobit,Gone to al of them except one so far.
16-04-2018T17:58:09,BluePhantom90,and Neko-con
16-04-2018T17:58:37,Dadrobit,all*
16-04-2018T17:58:45,Vatruvius,"I have never been to a Con, PAX, or any other event."
16-04-2018T17:59:08,Twokinds,"I'll be at momocon this year, but not as a dealer. Just as a casual con-goer this time."
16-04-2018T17:59:15,Twokinds,My first convention as a regular person.
16-04-2018T17:59:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"PAX is great. If you have any kind of significant following though, it’s hard to walk the floor"
16-04-2018T17:59:44,Bgrmystr2,you should enjoy it tom
16-04-2018T17:59:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Just act normal
16-04-2018T18:00:13,Dadrobit,ZapCon was my first con a couple years back. Then I started going to proper Comic Cons with other TK fans about two years ago. Added in Game On Expo this year as well for my sister who had a booth there.
16-04-2018T18:00:15,Vatruvius,I do not think I will have a follow problem. :D
16-04-2018T18:01:16,Dadrobit,Never been to PAX or SDCC though.
16-04-2018T18:01:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"PAX is huge though. East, anyway - never seen the others"
16-04-2018T18:02:15,BluePhantom90,"Eh I been thinking of going to Comic con, But if its being held in California I don't want to spend a dime going there. e-e state is kinda dying slowly anyways"
16-04-2018T18:02:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"As for SDCC, not sure if I want to go across the country"
16-04-2018T18:02:34,Dadrobit,:/ Heading out further than one state away is just too much of an investment for me right now. I'd need a heck of a good reason to go.
16-04-2018T18:02:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Cali’s expensive
16-04-2018T18:02:59,DRAGONTANOPUG,"My mom whats me to go toa comic in Bosie, i dont want to cause why would i go."
16-04-2018T18:03:00,Dadrobit,Cali's dying? Since when?
16-04-2018T18:03:04,DRAGONTANOPUG,Rhetorical
16-04-2018T18:03:06,Vatruvius,You think my state is dying! :ptv-angry:
16-04-2018T18:03:07,Twokinds,My brother gets hounded a lot whereever he goes.
16-04-2018T18:03:18,DRAGONTANOPUG,No der
16-04-2018T18:03:31,DRAGONTANOPUG,17 million people is a lot
16-04-2018T18:03:32,SpazztasticKiwi,He says he got mobbed at a restaurant one of the days he was there
16-04-2018T18:03:45,Twokinds,Yeah
16-04-2018T18:04:02,Vatruvius,He has over 20M subscribers...where would he go and not be hounded?
16-04-2018T18:04:15,Bgrmystr2,home?
16-04-2018T18:04:18,Dadrobit,Nebraska.
16-04-2018T18:04:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"I only saw him like once, but didn’t get to talk to him"
16-04-2018T18:04:27,DRAGONTANOPUG,Well ok 20 mil.
16-04-2018T18:05:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Sometimes I wonder how he’s still dealing with it
16-04-2018T18:05:13,BluePhantom90,"Cali is dying because of High taxes, and the not regulating laws. they had Hepatitis B  epidemic. BTW Tom might want to get a shot before you go to Cali"
16-04-2018T18:05:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Jack even got mobbed the last day of PAX
16-04-2018T18:06:24,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s getting to the point that he might not be able to roam the floors like Mark
16-04-2018T18:07:35,Vatruvius,High taxes because it is Cali...as for regulation we have quite a bit...mever heard about the Hep. B but if you don't do things with random people you shoul be fine.
16-04-2018T18:07:45,Dadrobit,You mean Hep A?
16-04-2018T18:07:47,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Tom, get mark too give you another shout out for more viewers."
16-04-2018T18:07:54,Twokinds,lol
16-04-2018T18:07:59,Dadrobit,"700 cases is hardly an ""epidemic""."
16-04-2018T18:08:14,BluePhantom90,And California has a app to by pass the streets with human fecal matter on them
16-04-2018T18:08:28,Vatruvius,700...in Cali. Ha...that is nothing.
16-04-2018T18:08:48,Dadrobit,"In fact, it's slowed down so heaily that as of the 11th, "" CDPH has demobilized the outbreak response"""
16-04-2018T18:08:49,Vatruvius,What?
16-04-2018T18:09:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Last time Mark commented on Tom was I think the Christmas livestream when their mom told him to pipe down cause he was still asleep
16-04-2018T18:09:19,DRAGONTANOPUG,2015 or 14
16-04-2018T18:09:25,DRAGONTANOPUG,When he was low on sibs
16-04-2018T18:09:28,SpazztasticKiwi,2017

16-04-2018T18:10:08,DRAGONTANOPUG,What if mark just made a video all about tk
16-04-2018T18:10:30,SpazztasticKiwi,He hasn’t mentioned Tom in a bit. Except for that story about popping him in the face when they were younger with a thigh blaster
16-04-2018T18:10:39,DRAGONTANOPUG,Lol
16-04-2018T18:10:47,DRAGONTANOPUG,Whos older
16-04-2018T18:10:52,DRAGONTANOPUG,Tom or mark
16-04-2018T18:10:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom
16-04-2018T18:11:07,Vatruvius,TK is pretty populare on its own...but I did find this from watching Mark's older videos.
16-04-2018T18:11:07,BluePhantom90,Oh should post this one video I thought was Mark until I notice the voice didn't match
16-04-2018T18:11:44,DRAGONTANOPUG,Yes but if mark made just vid on tk h
16-04-2018T18:11:58,DRAGONTANOPUG,Thats a possible 1 millio. More fans
16-04-2018T18:12:19,Dadrobit,"Also, since you were military, you were already vaccinated against Hep A."

16-04-2018T18:12:52,Vatruvius,Hmm...what would even do eith one video? Also...I do not want to deal with 1M new people in this chat.
16-04-2018T18:13:07,DRAGONTANOPUG,He could metion it in every video from now on XD for 20 million possible fans
16-04-2018T18:13:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t call him a furry when Mark’s around. Someone did that on tumblr once. Mark got a little defensive
16-04-2018T18:13:32,Vatruvius,Huh...
16-04-2018T18:13:35,DRAGONTANOPUG,Hes not one tho

16-04-2018T18:14:59,Dadrobit,"Couple years back I think I recall someone made a fan game that included a Stanley Parable reference, but even then I only watched videos sporadically."
16-04-2018T18:15:00,Vatruvius,People who are interested in this type of content will find it. I do not think Tom is concerned with how popular his comic is...he is doing pretty well.
16-04-2018T18:15:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Exactly
16-04-2018T18:15:21,DRAGONTANOPUG,Ok

16-04-2018T18:21:12,Vatruvius,Boy...how did Mark get you to do that video Tom?
16-04-2018T18:21:41,Vatruvius,Name thing?
16-04-2018T18:21:45,Twokinds,We both wanted to play the game?
16-04-2018T18:21:47,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Kiwi, you always want to prove me wronh"
16-04-2018T18:22:01,SpazztasticKiwi,If you says so
16-04-2018T18:22:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve seen bits of that video
16-04-2018T18:22:17,Dadrobit,It's a fun game if it's anything like the first.
16-04-2018T18:22:30,Dadrobit,Like a 3rd person tower defense.
16-04-2018T18:22:46,Twokinds,Too bad Mark wasn't a youtuber back when Portal 2 came out.
16-04-2018T18:22:50,Vatruvius,Ohh...you just do not seem that into doing videos...figured he strong armed you into making it or something. My mistake.
16-04-2018T18:22:57,Twokinds,We breezed through that co-op
16-04-2018T18:22:58,Dadrobit,"Ohhh, dang, yeah."
16-04-2018T18:23:37,DRAGONTANOPUG,https://youtu.be/RRao_Fl_z2g
16-04-2018T18:23:40,DRAGONTANOPUG,Better?
16-04-2018T18:24:00,Vatruvius,I forced my sister to play the co-op...it ended with me juggling two controlers half way through.
16-04-2018T18:24:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m sure you two could still play whenever he comes over again
16-04-2018T18:24:17,Dadrobit,Peeps are still uploading coop runs of that game.
16-04-2018T18:24:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Would you both try overwatch?
16-04-2018T18:24:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"Not necessarily to record either, of course"
16-04-2018T18:25:42,BluePhantom90,yeah same when I was in Afghanistan. Buddy of mine played Portal and Portal 2 when we were bored
16-04-2018T18:25:51,Dadrobit,3 new P2 coop videos from different channels in just the last hour. Game's pretty good.
16-04-2018T18:27:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, did Mark tell you his plans to record a series on you and Holly when he went back home this last time?"
16-04-2018T18:27:23,Vatruvius,I loved that game...one of the best games I played.
16-04-2018T18:28:05,DRAGONTANOPUG,https://youtu.be/KeIagRX4KQs     skip to 15 seconds and watch till 30
16-04-2018T18:30:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m gonna clean Peeka’s cage for a bit. Here’s to hoping she doesn’t get me

16-04-2018T18:31:25,Dadrobit,Good luck

16-04-2018T18:32:57,Vatruvius,Did I catch it right earlier that you feed your frog mice?
16-04-2018T18:33:05,Dadrobit,TIL: Pac Man Frog
16-04-2018T18:34:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"In theory, she could eat rats, but they have a habit of trying to swallow anything they bite so I want to make sure she doesn’t choke"
16-04-2018T18:35:33,BluePhantom90,BTW I thought this was Mark.. BUT figured out about half way that it wasn't. BUT it was funny https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyDLMoA37ME&t=2s
16-04-2018T18:35:42,Twokinds,There was only one tiny gap in my blinds and it's exactly where my eyes are.
16-04-2018T18:36:14,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s how the world likes to work
16-04-2018T18:37:04,Dadrobit,I use a black bedsheet to cover my bedroom window.
16-04-2018T18:37:14,Dadrobit,Just for that problem.
16-04-2018T18:37:36,Twokinds,I've actually been incredibly tempted to buy a four poster bed
16-04-2018T18:37:48,Twokinds,So I can hand blackout curtains around it
16-04-2018T18:37:55,Twokinds,So my bed is always in darkness.
16-04-2018T18:38:02,Dadrobit,"I have bamboo blinds there already, but the tiny slits were always catching the sun ~juuuuust~ right."
16-04-2018T18:38:10,Vatruvius,"What is your ideal nature scene Tom? If you were out in nature or livong in it would you be in a forest with mountain views, grassy meadows and oak trees, ocean sounds and beaches?"
16-04-2018T18:38:31,BluePhantom90,lol
16-04-2018T18:38:48,Dadrobit,One day I'll have something bigger than a twin. #LifeGoals.

16-04-2018T18:43:09,Dadrobit,Have a particularly fond memory of dirtbiking on a mountain trail in light rain w/ my father many years ago. Came to the top of a mountain and just saw endless mountain range and valleys in front of us over the crest. The image of those mountains with
16-04-2018T18:43:18,Dadrobit,the deep cloudy sky always stuck with me.
16-04-2018T18:43:33,Vatruvius,Haha...not bad. I am nearly there already. It gets a little hot for me but autumn is pretty in some areas. Mostly evergreens where I live.

16-04-2018T19:20:28,DRAGONTANOPUG,Why am i suddenly tempted to take a photo on instagram and pit the link here to show you guys.
16-04-2018T19:22:28,Vatruvius,Necause you want attention?

16-04-2018T19:31:56,DRAGONTANOPUG,Is it normal to want attention?
16-04-2018T19:32:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Pet annoying you? Smother them with love and they disappear for a few minutes
16-04-2018T19:32:42,Twokinds,"i tried, doesn't work. cat next to me wants pets"

16-04-2018T19:33:54,SpazztasticKiwi,You must be having a great time
16-04-2018T19:34:56,SpazztasticKiwi,The thing about smothering with love is you have to act like your mother when you return home from being away
16-04-2018T19:35:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"Like returning from college for the holidays, where parents act like you’re been in another country"

16-04-2018T19:39:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom, would it kill you too much to brush Holly? It might be hell during, but would help keeping the hair out of the air and off everything else"
16-04-2018T19:39:37,Dadrobit,Black slacks and button down shirts.
16-04-2018T19:39:46,Dadrobit,It works for me.
16-04-2018T19:39:48,SpazztasticKiwi,But it might kill you...
16-04-2018T19:40:20,Dadrobit,"Also, she was just unamused that I jostled to get my phone out of my pocket and stopped the pets."
16-04-2018T19:41:39,TheBeckoner,"Wasnt sayin it was bad, its just the only clothes i've seen in the pics you send"

16-04-2018T19:45:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Did you know that a guy that normally wears regular clothes looks becomes hotter in a suit and guys that wear suits a lot become hotter when they wear regular clothes?
16-04-2018T19:46:10,Dadrobit,Literally the same outfit too. GG.
16-04-2018T19:46:50,Vatruvius,Is that why I look so good in a suit?
16-04-2018T19:47:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I swear that’s how it works

16-04-2018T19:54:04,Dadrobit,:/ Still $45 too.
16-04-2018T19:54:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Generally just sits and waits for it to be done
16-04-2018T19:54:48,Vatruvius,It was 45% off during the spring sale.
16-04-2018T19:55:10,Dadrobit,"Ouch, just missed it then?"

16-04-2018T20:16:52,SpazztasticKiwi,PDF files usually go directly to the device you purchase them on
16-04-2018T20:17:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Most of the ones I’ve seen start downloading automatically when you click or buy them
16-04-2018T20:19:45,qwe304,"I'd think so spazz, but it may be different since its a preorder"
16-04-2018T20:20:16,qwe304,@Twokinds how many of the signed prints have been claimed so far?
16-04-2018T20:20:47,Twokinds,Not sure exactly.
16-04-2018T20:21:46,qwe304,they'll be removed once they do sell out though right?
16-04-2018T20:21:52,Vatruvius,All the prints...I claimed all the prints!
16-04-2018T20:21:53,Vatruvius,:P
16-04-2018T20:22:05,Twokinds,We had to increase the number of prints pretty much immediately.
16-04-2018T20:22:26,qwe304,more orders than anticipated?
16-04-2018T20:22:37,Twokinds,I didn't want them to run out in the first day.

16-04-2018T20:24:13,Vatruvius,So did I...limited number of prints...everyone buys them day one to get one.
16-04-2018T20:24:33,Vatruvius,That is what mom's are for.
16-04-2018T20:25:10,Twokinds,lol yeah they're going to run out pretty quick.
16-04-2018T20:25:13,qwe304,"the store still says limited to 200, the same as it was when i saw it"
16-04-2018T20:25:42,qwe304,I'd gotten mine ordered before tom had the chance to tweet it
16-04-2018T20:26:32,Vatruvius,So how much more signing does your hand have to do Tom?
16-04-2018T20:27:04,Twokinds,600 prob
16-04-2018T20:27:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Ouch
16-04-2018T20:27:47,qwe304,"well, hopefully you'll be able to pace them out ofer a week or two so you dont burn yourself out."

16-04-2018T20:29:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"You have till about July before they ship right, and they’ll be getting to your house soon after the order deadline?"
16-04-2018T20:29:33,qwe304,"how does the whole signing part work? you'd said tyhat keenspot handles the shipping, are they sending you all the posters for you to sign, then return to them?"
16-04-2018T20:30:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe divvying up 600 won’t be too awful on you
16-04-2018T20:30:29,Twokinds,Why are you asking me so many things

16-04-2018T20:56:46,Twokinds,120 is way too much for contacts

16-04-2018T20:58:04,Vatruvius,Does drawing too much on that tablet irritate your eyes Tom?
16-04-2018T20:58:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Everyone has their preference
16-04-2018T20:58:10,Twokinds,"No, knock off, not knock out"

16-04-2018T20:58:37,Twokinds,Yeah I get some eye fatique sometimes
16-04-2018T20:58:38,Bgrmystr2,"""Knock yourself off"" sounds painful. or bad. Or good. I don't know. :ptv-ohmy:"
16-04-2018T20:58:53,Vatruvius,"No...I have no experience with southern ""slag"" Kiwi."

16-04-2018T20:59:35,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
16-04-2018T20:59:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Sounds like a euphemism to me

16-04-2018T21:02:12,DRAGONTANOPUG,Raybans
16-04-2018T21:02:16,SpazztasticKiwi,They’re kinda like sunglasses but for computer light in stead of sunlight
16-04-2018T21:02:26,Twokinds,I would never pay more than 20 bucks
16-04-2018T21:02:34,DRAGONTANOPUG,Sigh*

16-04-2018T21:05:45,CatzArt,Any idea why when trying to watch old Twokinds  streams they fail to load?
16-04-2018T21:06:02,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Vatru, 😂"

16-04-2018T21:07:58,DRAGONTANOPUG,XD
16-04-2018T21:08:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Thinking about it though I don’t know if buying a bride is makes it more worth it than dating to find one
16-04-2018T21:08:56,qwe304,for drawing I use this windows 2-1 that has a built in wacom tablet
16-04-2018T21:09:14,Vatruvius,Na...I was referring Tom found a wife through dating but broke the truth about what he was willing to commit money wise to the relationship...

16-04-2018T21:10:12,Vatruvius,No...it does not.
16-04-2018T21:10:32,Bgrmystr2,"IDeally, it shouldn't be expensive"
16-04-2018T21:10:45,Bgrmystr2,"cuz if money is what you throw at your date, then you missed the point of dating"
16-04-2018T21:10:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"Logically, it shouldn’t be expensive"
16-04-2018T21:11:03,Vatruvius,However...I would question if in a relationship all she wanted was expensive three course meals and clothes...that would be a problem for me.
16-04-2018T21:11:29,Bgrmystr2,Same
16-04-2018T21:11:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"Dating is to get to know the person. If you’re going out to do stuff, you can just as well go alone"
16-04-2018T21:11:33,qwe304,"imo, if a girl doesnt offer to split the bill by the third date (if it gets that far), thats not a relationship I'd pursue."
16-04-2018T21:11:52,Bgrmystr2,"I'd have a lot of questions immediately, Vatru"
16-04-2018T21:11:54,Twokinds,"Anything over $20, the date pays!"
16-04-2018T21:11:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I prefer to pay my own bill no matter which date we’re on
16-04-2018T21:12:10,Vatruvius,lol
16-04-2018T21:12:39,Vatruvius,Sometimes you gotta late the guy pay...

16-04-2018T21:16:07,MidnightBlue78,"ok so, who's getting married?"
16-04-2018T21:16:13,DRAGONTANOPUG,No kne
16-04-2018T21:16:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"But yeah generally I don’t get a dinner over $20; oftentimes, it’s not even $15. I just can’t stuff myself like that"
16-04-2018T21:16:14,DRAGONTANOPUG,One
16-04-2018T21:16:29,DRAGONTANOPUG,Tom just doesn't want to spend any money for at least $20 on anything
16-04-2018T21:16:43,DRAGONTANOPUG,Or at least*
16-04-2018T21:17:13,MidnightBlue78,Its good to be frugal
16-04-2018T21:17:24,Vatruvius,I guess it is all subjective...but here in Cali. a good meal for one will be around $15-$25
16-04-2018T21:17:38,DRAGONTANOPUG,He needs glasses but cant find a pair for 20 bucka
16-04-2018T21:17:40,DRAGONTANOPUG,Bucka
16-04-2018T21:17:42,qwe304,I almost always spend less than $15 even at a sit down restraunt
16-04-2018T21:17:50,MidnightBlue78,i buy stuff from the dollar tree

16-04-2018T21:18:06,MidnightBlue78,"Tom, the dollar tree has glasses for a buck"
16-04-2018T21:18:08,CatzArt,A good philosophy Tom has for conserving money. I know I'm a cheap bugger when it comes to buying art supplies.
16-04-2018T21:18:18,Vatruvius,Hmm...Dollar Tree stuff is ****!
16-04-2018T21:18:23,MidnightBlue78,you should check them out
16-04-2018T21:18:41,Bgrmystr2,"lol, midnight, the problem is the lenses being right for the frame"
16-04-2018T21:18:42,MidnightBlue78,Not everything
16-04-2018T21:18:54,DRAGONTANOPUG,Bgr XD
16-04-2018T21:18:58,CatzArt,The dollar tree also is a good place to get candy cheap if you dont want to buy it at the movie theater
16-04-2018T21:19:02,MidnightBlue78,you guys don't even understand humor
16-04-2018T21:19:13,MidnightBlue78,I give up
16-04-2018T21:19:13,Vatruvius,However...people in Cali tend to have better paying jobs and can afford these meals Kiwi...minimum wage here is $10.50 and will be $15.00 by 2022
16-04-2018T21:19:20,DRAGONTANOPUG,Or their is no humor
16-04-2018T21:19:33,MidnightBlue78,Definitely there isn't any
16-04-2018T21:19:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m paid $11.50/hr
16-04-2018T21:19:37,Bgrmystr2,"I wasn't being funny, midnight. Our dollar tree actually has glasses frames there."
16-04-2018T21:19:44,Bgrmystr2,and they're trash
16-04-2018T21:19:48,Bgrmystr2,and never fit lenses xD
16-04-2018T21:19:56,DRAGONTANOPUG,Cosco has some
16-04-2018T21:20:11,MidnightBlue78,"well, Tom doesn't want to spend a lot, i was giving him an option"
16-04-2018T21:20:15,Bgrmystr2,xD
16-04-2018T21:20:21,Vatruvius,My dad buys Costco bulk glasses...they get the job done.
16-04-2018T21:20:43,Bgrmystr2,I've never been to a costco. Didn't know it existed till a couple years ago
16-04-2018T21:20:48,DRAGONTANOPUG,Raybans for 120 bucks that last and work well
16-04-2018T21:21:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"I just don’t see the point in buying a big expensive dinner even if you can. If you’re not in a bind, you can often cook the same and make it exactly to your liking"
16-04-2018T21:21:13,Vatruvius,I knew about Costco since I was little...my parents have been taking me there for years.
16-04-2018T21:21:21,Bgrmystr2,cuz you have one nearby
16-04-2018T21:21:25,MidnightBlue78,"i mean, if you're not bumping into things and you can read from an inch away, i guess they're good"
16-04-2018T21:21:29,Bgrmystr2,I've never gone anywhere that had one
16-04-2018T21:21:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Cooking at home also helps prevent socializing
16-04-2018T21:21:48,Bgrmystr2,yeah you wouldn't want that kiwi
16-04-2018T21:21:48,SpazztasticKiwi,😄
16-04-2018T21:21:52,Bgrmystr2,socializing is evil
16-04-2018T21:22:10,DRAGONTANOPUG,Than what are you doing right now
16-04-2018T21:22:20,Bgrmystr2,"where I live, people have never heard of Publix lol"
16-04-2018T21:22:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Online chat
16-04-2018T21:22:34,Vatruvius,Not all meals in Cali. are pricey Kiwi. They can be quite affordable...just a nice dinner like a formal date would be $15-$25 per person. Or in my case...a family of 4 can be pricey...but we also eat nice so...yeah.
16-04-2018T21:22:40,DRAGONTANOPUG,Publix?
16-04-2018T21:22:49,Bgrmystr2,"Yeh, it's a grocery store"
16-04-2018T21:22:54,DRAGONTANOPUG,Oh
16-04-2018T21:22:59,MidnightBlue78,Publix is pricey
16-04-2018T21:23:04,Bgrmystr2,yeah it's nice
16-04-2018T21:23:11,DRAGONTANOPUG,We has bi mart
16-04-2018T21:23:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not a big fan of big fancy formal dinner places
16-04-2018T21:23:12,MidnightBlue78,i go to the commissary on base
16-04-2018T21:23:42,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno if they've changed since I moved away midnight, but Publix has always had a decent quality of stuff. Food Lion was the best tho :V"
16-04-2018T21:23:49,Vatruvius,By formal I mean like a steak house or something...but it obviously depends on the relationship and the individuals in it.
16-04-2018T21:24:00,MidnightBlue78,Publix is still good
16-04-2018T21:24:08,MidnightBlue78,I just never shop there
16-04-2018T21:24:11,Bgrmystr2,good to hear :thumbsup:
16-04-2018T21:24:19,Bgrmystr2,yeh..
16-04-2018T21:24:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I have to watch ingredients too. Some stuff can make me very sick
16-04-2018T21:24:38,Vatruvius,Safeway and Briar Patch over here!
16-04-2018T21:25:08,Vatruvius,Since I am Celiac and the rest of my family have all these different food allergies...reading labels is a thing we do.
16-04-2018T21:25:15,MidnightBlue78,"I dont know if im weird, but if i were on a date i prefer a casual place instead of a fancy formal restaurant"
16-04-2018T21:25:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Fun isn’t it?
16-04-2018T21:25:42,MidnightBlue78,I'd rather fo eat pizza or burgers
16-04-2018T21:25:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Casual is better cause you don’t have to dress up
16-04-2018T21:25:50,MidnightBlue78,*go
16-04-2018T21:25:52,DRAGONTANOPUG,Merica
16-04-2018T21:25:56,MidnightBlue78,Exactly
16-04-2018T21:26:08,Vatruvius,I don't mind...it has become a part of my life so I am okay with it. Probably more so okay with it because the alternative of not reading the labels has a far worse outcome.
16-04-2018T21:26:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Why not make a pizza with your date as the date 🤔
16-04-2018T21:26:50,Vatruvius,Again...depends on the relationship...I think a formal date would be good for special occasions like Valentines or an anniversary or something.
16-04-2018T21:26:52,MidnightBlue78,that actually sounds fun
16-04-2018T21:27:48,Vatruvius,I am all for home cooked meals/activities for dates. Far more fun and let's you get to know the individual far more in a home/cooking/cleaning sense.
16-04-2018T21:28:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d like to try a white chocolate cookie recipe out too
16-04-2018T21:28:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"And a dark chocolate, caramel bar recipe"
16-04-2018T21:28:48,DRAGONTANOPUG,G'night guys
16-04-2018T21:28:55,Vatruvius,Goodnight!
16-04-2018T21:28:59,MidnightBlue78,goodnight!
16-04-2018T21:29:50,MidnightBlue78,I am going to make some banana and peanut butter bars tomorrow
16-04-2018T21:30:22,Vatruvius,Ohh...that reminds me...I need help on this suggestion guys.
16-04-2018T21:30:24,MidnightBlue78,"it's a recipe i found, because i need to ise a whole bunch of bananas i have"
16-04-2018T21:30:35,MidnightBlue78,*use
16-04-2018T21:31:04,Vatruvius,You can freeze the bananas for use in fruit smoothies. They are actually quite good.
16-04-2018T21:32:18,MidnightBlue78,"yep, already put some in the freezer"
16-04-2018T21:32:30,MidnightBlue78,but there's just so many
16-04-2018T21:32:37,Vatruvius,So...I need to pick between these two ideas.
16-04-2018T21:32:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera’s shedding all over me
16-04-2018T21:32:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Shoot
16-04-2018T21:33:32,Vatruvius,"These are the simplified versions...""Kat finds peanut butter on the ship"" or ""youngEric gives youngKat peanut butter."""
16-04-2018T21:34:22,SpazztasticKiwi,First sounds good
16-04-2018T21:34:48,qwe304,i got bored so I lined and flat colored this sketch
16-04-2018T21:34:50,qwe304,https://imgur.com/a/Z2fVc
16-04-2018T21:35:06,NightMeaty22,Well i'm gonna be back for a little bit
16-04-2018T21:35:31,MidnightBlue78,Kat likes peanut butter?
16-04-2018T21:36:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Also Tom what’s the reason you wanna switch to contacts? Getting tired of glasses?
16-04-2018T21:37:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause I swapped because my glasses broke twice between two months so I decided to get something a little harder to break
16-04-2018T21:38:18,Vatruvius,Raine's right hand is transparent qwe.
16-04-2018T21:38:24,Vatruvius,Alright...first it is.
16-04-2018T21:39:12,Vatruvius,"What about ""youngEric protecting Kat from Roderick."""
16-04-2018T21:45:03,qwe304,that happened
16-04-2018T21:45:18,qwe304,its been sketched
16-04-2018T21:45:25,Bgrmystr2,that dot in her eye
16-04-2018T21:45:28,Bgrmystr2,I can't unsee
16-04-2018T21:47:40,Vatruvius,Great...thanks Bgr...not I cannot unsee.
16-04-2018T21:47:52,Vatruvius,Has that been done qwe?
16-04-2018T21:47:56,Vatruvius,Let me take a look.
16-04-2018T21:49:20,Vatruvius,I see it...but my suggestion was youngEric...like kidEric but that is good enough. Scratch that idea off.
16-04-2018T21:50:12,Vatruvius,Let's see here...
16-04-2018T21:50:49,Vatruvius,I do have a Natani/Keith one that is pretty cool. It is sappy though...would you guys like another sappy Natani/Keith suggestion in the polls?
16-04-2018T21:50:58,Vatruvius,Over the other suggestions I have?
16-04-2018T21:56:49,MidnightBlue78,"Good night peeps, catch you all later :ptv-sleepy:"
16-04-2018T21:57:08,Vatruvius,Goodnight Blue!

16-04-2018T21:59:02,Twokinds,I like sappy
16-04-2018T21:59:06,Vatruvius,The sappiest of saps.
16-04-2018T21:59:28,Twokinds,Twokinds is 50% maple sap
16-04-2018T21:59:36,Vatruvius,:ptv-excited: I was graced with the Sap God's attention! :ptv-hearts:
16-04-2018T21:59:39,qwe304,:thinking:
16-04-2018T22:00:03,Vatruvius,Going for that organic sap...the best sap.
16-04-2018T22:00:44,Vatruvius,It is not that sappy...just a simple affection thing. I really don't want to give it away but...imagine the recent umbrella sketch but a little more.
16-04-2018T22:02:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom is a sappy fan
16-04-2018T22:02:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Noted
16-04-2018T22:03:02,Vatruvius,You did not get that from the comic Kiwi?
16-04-2018T22:03:18,Vatruvius,Like Tom said...50% sap.
16-04-2018T22:03:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Just because it’s in the comic doesn’t mean I automatically see it as a reflection of the writer
16-04-2018T22:04:15,SpazztasticKiwi,But I just found out there’s a place that sells Jack Daniel’s in fused banana splits
16-04-2018T22:04:35,Vatruvius,What?
16-04-2018T22:04:36,Twokinds,That's... an interesting combination.
16-04-2018T22:04:46,Twokinds,I'd try it if I could drink.
16-04-2018T22:04:46,SpazztasticKiwi,It looked good
16-04-2018T22:05:02,SpazztasticKiwi,But I’m not a drinker
16-04-2018T22:05:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I thought you just didn’t drink
16-04-2018T22:05:35,Twokinds,Both
16-04-2018T22:06:12,Vatruvius,Got some of that thing Mark has where he can't drink?
16-04-2018T22:06:39,Twokinds,Pretty much
16-04-2018T22:06:47,Twokinds,"A little worse, even."
16-04-2018T22:06:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"Makes sense - can’t drink without getting sick, so don’t drink"

16-04-2018T22:08:18,SpazztasticKiwi,No hangover if there’s no alcohol
16-04-2018T22:08:20,Vatruvius,"You left out the rat poison that is customarily added. Kinda gives it that ""kick"" people are looking for."
16-04-2018T22:08:27,Ordithus,You left out the one part I can have without being miserable
16-04-2018T22:08:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I fail to really see the allure of alcohol
16-04-2018T22:09:36,Vatruvius,Same...I do not get it. It is a poison to the human body...by all means let's consume it then...?
16-04-2018T22:09:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"And if Tom’s 50% sap, draining that sap would probably get you to that weight goal 😄"

16-04-2018T22:16:59,Dadrobit,I can't do contacts. I have crazy anxiety about things getting close to my eyeballs.
16-04-2018T22:17:19,Vatruvius,A natural reaction...I would not like things close to my eyeballs either.

16-04-2018T22:20:19,Dadrobit,"To be fair, part of it was because I had just come off a 12hr shift and hadn't eaten all day, so I wasn't in great shape going in the door."

16-04-2018T22:42:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom’s response in that video is what got me
16-04-2018T22:42:40,Vatruvius,I would not say I have anything on my sister...not sure what she has that I could blackmail with. And what would I blackmail my sister for anyway?
16-04-2018T22:43:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Something along the lines of “anything I capsule blackmail you with is already on the internet”
16-04-2018T22:43:12,SpazztasticKiwi,*could
16-04-2018T22:43:49,Vatruvius,lol...that is so true.
16-04-2018T22:44:03,Vatruvius,Mark has no secrets...he sold his soul to the internet.
16-04-2018T22:44:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Pretty sure he just has no shame
16-04-2018T22:45:25,Vatruvius,Don't think that is in his dictionary either.
16-04-2018T22:46:32,Vatruvius,I loved these animations.

16-04-2018T22:47:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom did you ever try out Monster Legends?
16-04-2018T22:51:03,Vatruvius,Those were worthy revisits.
16-04-2018T22:52:34,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s a lot worth revisiting at any given time
16-04-2018T22:54:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I’ll say I’m not on his or Jack’s channel much anymore
16-04-2018T22:54:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m mainly watching Philip DeFranco or Tom
16-04-2018T22:55:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Or Thomas
16-04-2018T22:55:22,Twokinds,Or Tim
16-04-2018T22:55:40,Bgrmystr2,I hear this Tim guy is a pretty cool fellow
16-04-2018T22:55:49,Bgrmystr2,"draws a bunch, lotta fans"
16-04-2018T22:55:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Pretty hot too
16-04-2018T22:56:03,Twokinds,"When I was really young, I went to a very tiny school for my first couple years."
16-04-2018T22:56:04,SpazztasticKiwi,My God I thought we were talking about a fictitious tell not a euphemism for Tom I’m so sorry
16-04-2018T22:56:10,Ordithus,He can also shoot flames out of his staff
16-04-2018T22:56:11,SpazztasticKiwi,*Tim
16-04-2018T22:56:24,Twokinds,There was only three students in my entire 1st grade class.
16-04-2018T22:56:37,Twokinds,"Like, for the whole school. Just us three."
16-04-2018T22:56:44,Twokinds,"And our names were Tom, Tim, and Tonya."
16-04-2018T22:56:44,SpazztasticKiwi,That sounds like a pretty good deal
16-04-2018T22:56:56,Ordithus,That is very tiny... Tom... you cannot be serious
16-04-2018T22:57:00,BluePhantom90,I am kinda calling bs... e-e I don't believe it
16-04-2018T22:57:03,SpazztasticKiwi,No Tamantha?
16-04-2018T22:57:15,Twokinds,It's true.
16-04-2018T22:57:32,BluePhantom90,was it a private school?
16-04-2018T22:57:36,Twokinds,I never saw Tonya again but I was friends with Tim for a while. I actually met up with him again a few years back.
16-04-2018T22:57:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Bet you couldn’t get away with anything
16-04-2018T22:57:56,Twokinds,It's weird meeting up with old friends from school.
16-04-2018T22:58:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Even weirder to run into someone who was less than nice to you
16-04-2018T22:58:36,Twokinds,"I looked up my best friend from middle school, and I was pretty surprised. Completely different."
16-04-2018T22:58:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Adulthood hits some people hard
16-04-2018T22:58:58,Twokinds,"From what I can tell, he's SUPER religious now."
16-04-2018T22:59:03,Ordithus,"I still am friends with my best friend from waaay back, from 2nd grade"
16-04-2018T22:59:16,Twokinds,"He definitely wasn't before. I don't have anything against the religious, but it's like... wow..."
16-04-2018T22:59:16,Dadrobit,"My ten year reunion is coming up soon, kind of dreading it in a way."
16-04-2018T22:59:25,Ordithus,He's one of the few people I still see from back home
16-04-2018T22:59:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel there is a point where you can go overboard with it
16-04-2018T23:00:00,Twokinds,"Like, how does that happen."
16-04-2018T23:00:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Sometimes they’ll meet someone that influences them to that point
16-04-2018T23:00:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Other times an event pushes them into it
16-04-2018T23:00:56,BluePhantom90,"everyone changes around at 14 years old, then around 18 they change again, then the final stage of change is around 20 or 21"
16-04-2018T23:01:21,Bgrmystr2,I don't think age has anything to do with when people change
16-04-2018T23:01:26,Twokinds,I am exactly the same as I was when I was 14!
16-04-2018T23:01:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m pretty much rounded out then I guess
16-04-2018T23:01:34,Twokinds,Still have the same website and everything.
16-04-2018T23:01:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh dear
16-04-2018T23:01:38,Twokinds,XD
16-04-2018T23:01:39,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I guess if theyre influenced by something when theyre vulnerable...
16-04-2018T23:01:40,Bgrmystr2,xD Tom
16-04-2018T23:01:49,Ordithus,Still drawing the same doodles
16-04-2018T23:02:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you like something and it works, why change"
16-04-2018T23:02:04,BluePhantom90,because tom you are still a kid inside and never grew up
16-04-2018T23:02:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Can’t age if you think young
16-04-2018T23:02:20,unsteddyphoenix,"One of my best friends in highschool was religious, and he doubled down on it after graduation. So much that it probably ruined our friendship. :/"
16-04-2018T23:02:46,unsteddyphoenix,"I dont hate religious people but he went full ""gay shouldnt marry"" tier"

16-04-2018T23:03:44,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah. It'll be a normal convo then bam, something really controversial that you dont agree with"
16-04-2018T23:03:49,Ordithus,"Heh, funny.  When I found religion I became way more liberal"
16-04-2018T23:04:35,Bgrmystr2,"I never really had a problem with religion till my parents really tried to push it on me, and at that point I stepped away and said no. I'm not doin it. I won't be forced into it"
16-04-2018T23:04:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"Family’s not racist, but they can be biased (if that makes sense)"
16-04-2018T23:04:49,qwe304,"my views are very controvercial, so i only share them with close friends or people I'll never see again"
16-04-2018T23:05:06,Bgrmystr2,I still don't have a problem with religion it started forcing it's ideals on others. Then I do.
16-04-2018T23:05:20,Bgrmystr2,until it starts*

16-04-2018T23:06:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Born and raised Baptist - have my own mindset now
16-04-2018T23:07:28,Bgrmystr2,I'm actually rather glad they didn't get me phoenix. I saw immediately that they were trying to force it onto me and got the hell out of it
16-04-2018T23:07:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Thing about Baptist though seems to be the marriage thing - gotta be married before you get in the same bed with each other
16-04-2018T23:08:16,SpazztasticKiwi,But they’re all for lots of kids and grandkids
16-04-2018T23:08:20,unsteddyphoenix,"The best success rate is like, the really young years. Hard to be sold on god when you know santa isnt real lol"

16-04-2018T23:27:10,unsteddyphoenix,Is that a thing you can find out
16-04-2018T23:27:17,Dadrobit,Heavily male.
16-04-2018T23:27:29,Dadrobit,From the two surveys that I recall.
16-04-2018T23:27:31,unsteddyphoenix,What nooo we're all cute girls~
16-04-2018T23:27:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Well there seems to be about 3 females on this chat
16-04-2018T23:27:43,unsteddyphoenix,Oh there were surveys? huh
16-04-2018T23:27:46,Dadrobit,I'm kawaii as shit.
16-04-2018T23:28:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Shit’s not that kawaii though
16-04-2018T23:28:03,unsteddyphoenix,"You can like, see if the owner of PCs are male of female when they visit your site I think?"
16-04-2018T23:28:10,unsteddyphoenix,Or...something?
16-04-2018T23:28:28,SpazztasticKiwi,What are you gonna do look under the PC’s skirt?
16-04-2018T23:28:28,Dadrobit,Is there a weeb lingo for people like me?
16-04-2018T23:28:36,Dadrobit,That sentance doesn't sound right.

16-04-2018T23:28:59,Dadrobit,&lt;3
16-04-2018T23:29:32,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah idk. I remember reading some stats they showed 4chan was more female than expected.
16-04-2018T23:29:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom, at SDCC, what’s the male to female visitor ratio?"
16-04-2018T23:29:51,Twokinds,Uh... that's hard to tell
16-04-2018T23:29:55,Twokinds,I couldn't say
16-04-2018T23:30:22,unsteddyphoenix,Next con keep a quiet tally
16-04-2018T23:30:31,Twokinds,"More male than female, but not by that much."
16-04-2018T23:30:47,Dadrobit,"tsk tsk, assuming genders!"
16-04-2018T23:30:55,SpazztasticKiwi,More guys come up to you to say hi than girls though right?
16-04-2018T23:30:59,Dadrobit,//sarcasm
16-04-2018T23:31:05,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah thats what he said
16-04-2018T23:31:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m talking more like if he’s away from the booth as opposed to at it
16-04-2018T23:31:52,unsteddyphoenix,Ohh ok
16-04-2018T23:32:23,SpazztasticKiwi,A lot of girls will be hesitant to approach a male creator of they’re out alone as opposed to at a booth or with others
16-04-2018T23:32:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I am anyway
16-04-2018T23:32:33,Vatruvius,Okay...I am back for real this time.
16-04-2018T23:32:43,Dadrobit,wb for real this time.
16-04-2018T23:32:49,unsteddyphoenix,fo' reals

16-04-2018T23:33:22,Dadrobit,Was it your mom?
16-04-2018T23:33:23,unsteddyphoenix,Ah that was me
16-04-2018T23:33:23,Twokinds,She'd sit down next to our table.

16-04-2018T23:33:44,Vatruvius,lol
16-04-2018T23:33:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Either she liked you or she wanted to talk and was too nervous
16-04-2018T23:34:05,Twokinds,Oh she wasn't nervous
16-04-2018T23:34:11,Twokinds,She was extremely energetic and talkative
16-04-2018T23:34:19,Bgrmystr2,genki girl confirmed
16-04-2018T23:34:23,unsteddyphoenix,Gross~
16-04-2018T23:34:24,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s your answer
16-04-2018T23:34:31,Dadrobit,"I'm just imagining a ""hover hand"" except full body."
16-04-2018T23:34:40,unsteddyphoenix,You can just...sit next to the arists?
16-04-2018T23:34:47,Twokinds,"I mean, you CAN"
16-04-2018T23:34:51,Twokinds,physically
16-04-2018T23:34:55,Dadrobit,She brought her own folding chair.
16-04-2018T23:34:58,unsteddyphoenix,But like...it's allowed?
16-04-2018T23:35:05,Dadrobit,In case a WWE fight broke out
16-04-2018T23:35:14,Dadrobit,Also convenient for sitting
16-04-2018T23:35:24,Twokinds,"You know, my first year at comic con was funny. We had a little girl who hung around the booth. She was a daughter of another creator."
16-04-2018T23:35:26,Bgrmystr2,xD convenient for sitting
16-04-2018T23:35:38,unsteddyphoenix,D'aw
16-04-2018T23:35:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"As long as she didn’t try to assault anyone there, it probably is ok"
16-04-2018T23:35:41,Dadrobit,D'aw
16-04-2018T23:35:42,Twokinds,"She would ask to see my artwork and I'd be very reluctant to because she was like, 10"
16-04-2018T23:35:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh dear
16-04-2018T23:35:54,Vatruvius,That is cute.
16-04-2018T23:35:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Wee one
16-04-2018T23:35:57,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-FloDance: something about butts?
16-04-2018T23:36:00,Dadrobit,Precarious
16-04-2018T23:36:14,Twokinds,But then one of the other people working there showed me what her mom does. Her mom's a pinup artist.
16-04-2018T23:36:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Well then
16-04-2018T23:36:27,Vatruvius,How old were you when you did your first Con? Like...have your own booth?
16-04-2018T23:36:28,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha
16-04-2018T23:36:32,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
16-04-2018T23:36:41,unsteddyphoenix,Something something the human body is beautiful
16-04-2018T23:36:56,Dadrobit,"""Oh, well in that case, I'd lie to introduce you to Kat"""
16-04-2018T23:36:56,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s called boobs
16-04-2018T23:37:15,Twokinds,lol yeah that made me feel a lot better.
16-04-2018T23:37:28,Twokinds,They were very open and nice people.
16-04-2018T23:37:44,Ordithus,Neat
16-04-2018T23:37:57,unsteddyphoenix,"Whats the min age for comiccon, if theres pinup arists just on the floor?"
16-04-2018T23:37:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe make an emergency sketch pad with “little kid safe” stuff you can show the tiny but curious ones that wonder by
16-04-2018T23:38:05,Vatruvius,"Really Ord...you could have done a better ""neat"" than that."
16-04-2018T23:38:14,Twokinds,There's no min age. There's kids all over the place.
16-04-2018T23:38:17,Dadrobit,Mostly the truly NSFW content is kept in notebooks.
16-04-2018T23:38:22,unsteddyphoenix,Oh yuck
16-04-2018T23:38:24,Ordithus,"Vatru, that wouldn't be appropriate"
16-04-2018T23:38:30,Twokinds,Nudity isn't allowed to be shown. You have to cover it with sticky notes if there is any.
16-04-2018T23:38:39,unsteddyphoenix,lol
16-04-2018T23:38:51,Dadrobit,He's not kidding. Sticky Notes for days.
16-04-2018T23:39:04,Vatruvius,Really? So you put sticky notes in each book/cover?
16-04-2018T23:39:08,Ordithus,I'm sure you know what's going on...
16-04-2018T23:39:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I think I saw a booth like that at PAX
16-04-2018T23:39:17,Twokinds,No not mine.
16-04-2018T23:39:20,unsteddyphoenix,"Is one persons jump ""Chief of Censorship"" and he jsut wanders around with sticky notes?"
16-04-2018T23:39:25,unsteddyphoenix,Dream job
16-04-2018T23:39:27,SpazztasticKiwi,“Why’s there sticky notes on her chest?”
16-04-2018T23:39:31,SpazztasticKiwi,“Oh”
16-04-2018T23:39:33,Ordithus,Does anyone vandalize the sticky notes?
16-04-2018T23:39:38,Dadrobit,"I remember my first con in Tucson had a ton of it, and I was just like, ""Wow, this is a thing?"""
16-04-2018T23:39:39,Ordithus,"Like, little circles"
16-04-2018T23:39:48,unsteddyphoenix,Ultamite prankz
16-04-2018T23:39:54,Twokinds,No people are good about it because it's hard to get in comic-con and no one wants to screw up and get kicked out
16-04-2018T23:39:58,Ordithus,I just like to draw 0's on things
16-04-2018T23:40:00,TheBeckoner,Use sticky notes to purify the world
16-04-2018T23:40:24,Dadrobit,(Insert joke about the notes not being sticky when they put them there)
16-04-2018T23:40:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"Girls walking around are like “big deal. I got the same stuff, mine’s just bigger”"
16-04-2018T23:40:42,Ordithus,"Never been to a con, but I've seen similar works at Renaissance fairs"
16-04-2018T23:40:42,unsteddyphoenix,LOL
16-04-2018T23:41:02,unsteddyphoenix,Theyre just notes initially xD
16-04-2018T23:41:26,unsteddyphoenix,Wait they censor renaissance fairs? that seems silly.
16-04-2018T23:41:33,unsteddyphoenix,Historical nipples should be fair game
16-04-2018T23:41:34,Ordithus,No censorship
16-04-2018T23:41:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve seen some artists that I swear have never seen a female in real life cause I’ll see their art and I just “that’s not how boobs work”
16-04-2018T23:41:46,unsteddyphoenix,Nice
16-04-2018T23:41:55,Ordithus,"And one of the artists was a bit like Luthien Nightwolf, if you know her works"
16-04-2018T23:41:57,Vatruvius,lol

16-04-2018T23:43:03,unsteddyphoenix,Though im scared if I browse it too much my art progression will go backwards
16-04-2018T23:43:17,Dadrobit,"Very possible, it's a pretty big event."
16-04-2018T23:43:32,Ordithus,It's also near Phoenix
16-04-2018T23:43:39,Dadrobit,Brother used to sell deep fried turkey legs at it.
16-04-2018T23:43:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Sage’s work isn’t terrible
16-04-2018T23:43:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"Wacky, but not terribly off"
16-04-2018T23:44:26,Ordithus,Sage is tame for a Katbox artist

16-04-2018T23:45:14,Dadrobit,"Hmmmm, wouldn't call it close to Phoenix. About an hour and a half to two hours East."
16-04-2018T23:45:46,Dadrobit,Just south of the Superstition Wilderness
16-04-2018T23:45:58,Twokinds,"Honestly, nothing really comes to mind. I've never had a very bad con experience."
16-04-2018T23:46:13,unsteddyphoenix,Never had one YET.
16-04-2018T23:46:24,unsteddyphoenix,Dont give up hope! Youre going to anthrocon right? :D
16-04-2018T23:46:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Exactly what I was thinking
16-04-2018T23:46:47,Dadrobit,"Whoa, you actually decided to do that?"
16-04-2018T23:46:50,Ordithus,"Robit, that's maybe an hour and a half with traffic or coming from the west end... Tucson is only 2 hours away"
16-04-2018T23:46:55,Twokinds,"Everything always generally goes my way, so unfortunately, that means I have very little to complain about."
16-04-2018T23:47:07,unsteddyphoenix,Aw that sucks. :/
16-04-2018T23:47:10,SpazztasticKiwi,“Unfortunately”?
16-04-2018T23:47:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d say that’s a win
16-04-2018T23:47:40,unsteddyphoenix,An artist that doesnt suffer?
16-04-2018T23:47:43,Twokinds,"Yeah, it sucks. Everything's just great all the time."
16-04-2018T23:47:44,unsteddyphoenix,Quite unforunate
16-04-2018T23:47:45,SpazztasticKiwi,You can go out in public or to a con and not get mobbed
16-04-2018T23:47:51,Bgrmystr2,It means Tom likes likes to complain about stuff :V
16-04-2018T23:47:54,Ordithus,Sounds horrible
16-04-2018T23:47:56,Bgrmystr2,that's what he means
16-04-2018T23:48:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d go buy a lottery ticket with that luck
