22-04-2018T00:06:44,Dadrobit,I wish I had more time for animes. Hopefully when I'm done w/ school...
22-04-2018T00:09:15,unsteddyphoenix,"Anime is so noncommital, just 20 mins"
22-04-2018T00:09:53,unsteddyphoenix,Im very slowly rewatching westworld 'cause each ep is like an hour long
22-04-2018T00:09:58,unsteddyphoenix,Even though I really like it

22-04-2018T00:13:40,Dadrobit,And life is full of interruptions at the moment.

22-04-2018T00:16:40,Vatruvius,I binge watch most of the time unless I am forced not to...like getting an HBO subscription to watch GoT one Saturday at a time.

22-04-2018T02:50:02,Bgrmystr2,interestingly.. from what the dentist told me.. yellow on your teeth isn't like a coating or whatever
22-04-2018T02:50:09,Bgrmystr2,it's your tooth actually changing color
22-04-2018T02:50:32,Bgrmystr2,so you'd have to shave the outer part of the tooth deep enough to actually get to a point where it's not yellowing
22-04-2018T02:50:56,Bgrmystr2,not sure if that's.. healthy for teeth to begin with but
22-04-2018T02:50:59,Bgrmystr2,tis what I was told

22-04-2018T03:06:29,unsteddyphoenix,And those spammers got through like you said

22-04-2018T03:08:08,unsteddyphoenix,same
22-04-2018T03:08:15,Bgrmystr2,Teamspeak's audio quality was trash.. so that's why I used skype really
22-04-2018T03:08:42,Bgrmystr2,"the control setup was way superior unfortunately, so that was a loss"
22-04-2018T03:09:16,Bgrmystr2,but I'd rather be able to hear someone rather than hearing 5 tin cans that echo and there's nothing I can do about it
22-04-2018T03:10:20,Bgrmystr2,thankfully Discord is superior on both fronts.. the quality of skype's audio plus the superior setup and control of teamspeak all in one

22-04-2018T15:51:10,ThingsAreMoving,More importantly how tf does a company lose a bill payment?
22-04-2018T15:54:42,ThingsAreMoving,"Also, I'm unable to watch the last 30 minutes of yesterday's stream. Can someone else check if it's working, please?"
22-04-2018T15:59:39,Bgrmystr2,I'll give it a looksee sure
22-04-2018T16:03:10,Bgrmystr2,video seems to not be loading at all for me
22-04-2018T16:03:49,Bgrmystr2,there it goes
22-04-2018T16:04:09,Bgrmystr2,"I told it to skip to 5 places or so.. and every time it fucked off, now it's at the beginning again lol"
22-04-2018T16:05:05,Bgrmystr2,it didn't even load the right video either
22-04-2018T16:05:07,Bgrmystr2,xD
22-04-2018T16:05:21,Bgrmystr2,"selected sunday stream, clicked the page stream"
22-04-2018T16:05:32,Bgrmystr2,"er, loaded the page stream rather"
22-04-2018T16:10:47,SilliconeCarbide,"doesnt load for me either, during certain sections in the last 30 minutes"
22-04-2018T16:11:03,SilliconeCarbide,stream which was uploaded to youtube has skips as well
22-04-2018T16:15:38,ThingsAreMoving,rip
22-04-2018T16:16:15,ThingsAreMoving,"owell, so yesterday's lagging was probably Picarto's side"
22-04-2018T16:19:33,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, yeah it's not doing very well on my ed"
22-04-2018T16:19:36,Bgrmystr2,end* ejkgfjhsaga
22-04-2018T16:19:43,Bgrmystr2,can't type for some reason
22-04-2018T17:01:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"Last month, the payment got lost in shipping but they still counted it since we technically still payed and had a record of payment"
22-04-2018T17:01:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"We got a credit for the late messages, too"
22-04-2018T17:02:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"But this month, itâ€™s gone missing again and they just shut off the phones instead of giving any notifications or warnings"
22-04-2018T17:23:02,Vatruvius,:ptv-sad: Just gave UPS my my laptop to get it repaired. Now I am computerless. :ptv-whiny:
22-04-2018T17:26:52,ThingsAreMoving,What was wrong with it?
22-04-2018T17:36:11,Vatruvius,"Broken keyboard. X, Z, and CTRL keys were unresponsive. Now I have to try to find a way to do my online homework and watch the streams without my laptop."
22-04-2018T18:28:33,Dadrobit,Long day in class today. Was futzing around in 5.1 surround one on one with one of my professors. Felt good to hear it all come together in some proper speakers instead of headphones.
22-04-2018T18:29:00,Dadrobit,Solid 3 hours of work done.
22-04-2018T18:29:17,Dadrobit,Before we were kicked out of the studio :(
22-04-2018T18:30:31,Vatruvius,Now you just got to work on 7.1 suround. :D Or is that not how sound design works?
22-04-2018T18:38:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Phone wonâ€™t be back on until sometime tomorrow afternoon
22-04-2018T18:38:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"Till then Iâ€™m using wifi, and when I start home thatâ€™ll be gone and Iâ€™ll be offline till itâ€™s fixed"
22-04-2018T18:39:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Iâ€™ll see yâ€™all then
22-04-2018T18:40:58,Dadrobit,"7.1 is a thing. Center, Center Left, Center Right, Left, Right, Back Left, Back Right, Subwoofer."
22-04-2018T18:42:33,Dadrobit,5
22-04-2018T18:42:43,Dadrobit,"4.1 is the same thing, minus the direct left and right."
22-04-2018T18:42:49,Dadrobit,5.1*
22-04-2018T18:44:41,Dadrobit,Cya when you're back Spazz
22-04-2018T18:49:07,Vatruvius,"I know how the 5.1 and 7.1 surround works, just not sure if that is something you have to worry about in sound design. Like, do you have to create your sounds differently if you want 5.1 or 7.1 surround?"
22-04-2018T19:04:33,Dadrobit,"There's nothing that would change in the original sound capture. And working within a digital workstation, once everything has been routed properly through the I/O, it would be much the same as 5.1 as all the crossovers are done automatically at that poin"
22-04-2018T19:04:36,Dadrobit,point*
22-04-2018T19:05:26,Dadrobit,However there may be differences in how the audio is processed after capture so that it fits more cohesively in the sonic space.
22-04-2018T19:06:15,Dadrobit,"And if I were to do this completely on an analog console, I'd be there for a day working on 5 second increments."
22-04-2018T19:08:14,Vatruvius,So when you are processing audio in a space you need to design it with surround in mind if you want surround.
22-04-2018T19:08:32,Dadrobit,"But working in Pro Tools, it gives you visualizers that you can work with. By dragging around a ""puck"" in the virtual space, it routes the audio channel to emit the sound from the speakers so that it appears to be coming from that same space irl."
22-04-2018T19:09:15,Dadrobit,"Yeah, in the real world production, all of this stuff would be super planned out way before hand."
22-04-2018T19:09:26,Vatruvius,"I see, is that complicated compared to sound design without surround in mind?"
22-04-2018T19:09:59,Dadrobit,But they generally always mix the sound in stereo first as that's the overwhelming majority of what the general population has at home.
22-04-2018T19:10:07,Dadrobit,that's what*
22-04-2018T19:10:34,Dadrobit,"nvm, had it right the first time***"
22-04-2018T19:11:10,Dadrobit,It is as complicated as you want it to be tbh.
22-04-2018T19:12:07,Dadrobit,The tools the program used to do this make 5.1 happen are simple enough to use that you can get a general mix as easy as clicking and dragging a couple points around.
22-04-2018T19:12:29,Vatruvius,How does surround sound design work with games like say an FPS or something? These games are in full surround sound so I assume tge sounds are tied to the objects that make that sound?
22-04-2018T19:12:41,Dadrobit,But you can also get stupidly technical with it and spend hours at a time on tiny segments.
22-04-2018T19:13:25,Dadrobit,That would have to be my assumption. It's all background code routing the audio to the corresponding speakers.
22-04-2018T19:15:05,Vatruvius,"It will be really interesting to see how realistic games will be graphically, sound wise, and mechsnics with all the hardwsre and software advances."
22-04-2018T19:15:07,Dadrobit,"I have only done work purely in video audio post-production. If it's not that, I can only make educated guesses."
22-04-2018T19:16:05,Vatruvius,All the more reason why I want to get into game design. Seems like too much fun.
22-04-2018T19:17:08,Dadrobit,High end gear is insane to experience as it is. The problem is waiting for consumer and pro-sumer gear to catch up in terms of quality so that the masses can join in.
22-04-2018T19:18:28,Dadrobit,And hope that crap like mp3 compression and dynamic compression don't screw everything over.
22-04-2018T19:20:45,Vatruvius,"Ohh yeah, briefly covered general file compression in class awhile a ago. Now I understand why games are getting so large. As more and more storage space reaches the consumer, there is less of a reason to degrade the quaility of files."
22-04-2018T19:21:13,Vatruvius,"But also lazy AAA title developers, they do not help either."
