25-08-2018T15:05:57,Ordithus,Raine might be too naive to know how lewd it is
25-08-2018T15:06:07,Combak,"A possible Mindscape follow-up sketch: The source of all these minds! Nora patching up an strange ""rift"" in the Mindscape... in outfit."
25-08-2018T15:06:12,Vatruvius,Hmm...now you got me thinking. Should I suggest the Zen x Raine full body message then suggest a Zen x Kat full body massage? See who is more popular?
25-08-2018T15:06:18,ThingsAreMoving,"Ord pls, her lewd fics prove otherwise"

25-08-2018T17:19:30,SpazztasticKiwi,She’s not ~naked~ per se
25-08-2018T17:19:42,Mippy,Arn't Spanish and Mexican pretty similar too?

25-08-2018T17:26:01,CommanderTrace,@HobbitGames I agree with you
25-08-2018T17:26:03,ShadowSoap,"Eh, we just watch Tom draw. The chat is usually a complete shitshow."
25-08-2018T17:26:08,HobbitGames,Hahaha lol
25-08-2018T17:26:10,Bgrmystr2,basically what Ord said lol
25-08-2018T17:26:14,ThingsAreMoving,but everything changed when the fire nation attacked
25-08-2018T17:26:25,ferociousfox,rich history
25-08-2018T17:26:27,ShadowSoap,Who's the fire nation?
25-08-2018T17:26:40,ThingsAreMoving,Dunno
25-08-2018T17:26:45,CommanderTrace,Germany has an interesting history
25-08-2018T17:26:47,BadSpidersDen,"oh, webcomic. nice :)"
25-08-2018T17:26:48,Twokinds,3 more minutes

25-08-2018T17:27:09,ThingsAreMoving,"I concur, Hobbit"
25-08-2018T17:27:12,CrRAR,I'm always impressed at how fast food plans come together for Tom
25-08-2018T17:27:21,unsteddyphoenix,counting down~
25-08-2018T17:27:21,Katfeathers,"acctualy that wasn't FN, a dragon just sneezed"
25-08-2018T17:27:25,MuonNeutrino,"@BadSpidersDen the artist draws the above-linked webcomic, and streams various art related to that here, voted on by the viewers. given the audience, a significant chunk of it is rather fanservice-y &gt;.&gt;"
25-08-2018T17:27:43,Mippy,I just broke two prongs on my hair brush...
25-08-2018T17:27:43,ThingsAreMoving,Muon you make it sound bad
25-08-2018T17:27:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel I’ve worked a prediction formula for when Tom goes for food:
25-08-2018T17:27:44,Ordithus,"Spiders, the beginning is a bit rough, but it gets very good"
25-08-2018T17:27:50,Bgrmystr2,"I was gonna say, things, yeah"
25-08-2018T17:27:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"We mention food, he realizes he’s hungry"
25-08-2018T17:27:56,Bgrmystr2,Muon makes it sound like it's a bad thing
25-08-2018T17:28:02,Bgrmystr2,"you got a problem with it, Muon? lol"
25-08-2018T17:28:06,ShadowSoap,As most people do.

25-08-2018T17:28:53,HobbitGames,"Basically, we watch Tom draw sexy animal people. Thats all you need to know"
25-08-2018T17:29:00,ShadowSoap,'Ello govna!
25-08-2018T17:29:10,CrRAR,Today is a slightly NOT animal person!
25-08-2018T17:29:14,ferociousfox,were a bit out of character today
25-08-2018T17:29:19,CrRAR,^
25-08-2018T17:29:21,MuonNeutrino,"i didn't say it was *bad*, just.... it's the sort of thing that might be a biiiiit surprising for a new viewer heh"
25-08-2018T17:29:22,CommanderTrace,Absolutely true HobbitGames
25-08-2018T17:29:27,Ordithus,Like half the cast is human...
25-08-2018T17:29:30,ShadowSoap,"Well....not always Hobbit, but that seems to be the Theme of this Stream :ptv-uneasy:"
25-08-2018T17:29:41,Mippy,Yeah...it's rare for human but to happen
25-08-2018T17:29:48,BadSpidersDen,I understand this is furry related. tbh i never quite got whats the big thing about it. maybe you could fill your thoughts on what makes furry special (for you)?
25-08-2018T17:29:49,ThingsAreMoving,"Ord, a bit less than half"
25-08-2018T17:30:03,Ordithus,"True, but it's close"
25-08-2018T17:30:06,ThingsAreMoving,Furry is a bit more appealing aesthetically
25-08-2018T17:30:07,ShadowSoap,I don't care that it's furry. I just like the story
25-08-2018T17:30:21,ThingsAreMoving,since the icky skin is covered by soft fur
25-08-2018T17:30:21,Bgrmystr2,"not really, bad. Furry art is just a different artstyle."
25-08-2018T17:30:23,ShadowSoap,I got hooked. What else can I say?
25-08-2018T17:30:34,Bgrmystr2,nothin any more or less special about it than anything else.
25-08-2018T17:30:35,MuonNeutrino,"i don't personally consider myself a furry, but for me i just think that well-drawn anthro art is more aesthetically appealing than humans"
25-08-2018T17:30:36,CrRAR,"lol @ drapes, when you have someone as fine as Kat living in your house, you coordinate the interior decorating to HER."
25-08-2018T17:30:41,MuonNeutrino,plus i hate people &gt;.&gt;

25-08-2018T17:31:19,Bgrmystr2,so maybe
25-08-2018T17:31:20,uniballer,plus tom just writes an awesome comic!
25-08-2018T17:31:23,BadSpidersDen,"yeah, seems years and tail make a cuteness thing go up"
25-08-2018T17:31:24,Mippy,*shrug* I have just always liked talking animal stories...fury goes along with that
25-08-2018T17:31:24,ShadowSoap,"What if we're all robots and ai,,,"
25-08-2018T17:31:30,ShadowSoap,Are we in the matrix?

25-08-2018T17:31:58,unsteddyphoenix,that is confirmed yeah
25-08-2018T17:31:59,MuonNeutrino,i also find that anthro stories are a fun vehicle to explore questions about race and how humans might actually interact with other intelligent beings
25-08-2018T17:32:00,feralarts2121,any one know if tom is going to the LA comic con?

25-08-2018T18:17:12,unsteddyphoenix,Nora also has over 300 confirmed transformations and placed top of her class in dragon school...
25-08-2018T18:17:37,Twokinds,tg obviously
25-08-2018T18:17:50,HobbitGames,Nora is kind of a psychopath. Randomly deciding to forcefully change people's genders.
25-08-2018T18:18:02,CommanderTrace,Do you like my name @Twokinds.
25-08-2018T18:18:02,Ordithus,Yep :ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:

25-08-2018T18:18:29,ZoopBoopLoop,I like the thought of Mike being able to swap back and forth freely (but being locked in form permanently once the necessary action is taken)
25-08-2018T18:18:33,HobbitGames,Well then she can summon up a monopoly boars or something
25-08-2018T18:18:48,BMAND,"...hmm reminds me, I need to find someone to colour a comm I recently had done. @_@"
25-08-2018T18:19:02,ThingsAreMoving,I'd love to see her being transformed forcefully into something just to give her a new perspective
25-08-2018T18:19:23,BadFoMo,@ThingsAreMoving Nora?
25-08-2018T18:19:24,Ordithus,I don't think she'd care much
25-08-2018T18:19:25,ShadowSoap,"Well, there's a sketch suggestion."
25-08-2018T18:19:29,ThingsAreMoving,"yes, FoMo"
25-08-2018T18:19:40,unsteddyphoenix,She might even be into it
25-08-2018T18:19:47,BadFoMo,Sounds interesting.
25-08-2018T18:19:48,HobbitGames,Just imagine if nora was forcefully transformed into a keidran for a year or something. She wouldnt be able to use magic
25-08-2018T18:19:54,Ordithus,She... did things... as a kitty
25-08-2018T18:19:56,unsteddyphoenix,She REALLY ENJOYS putting herselfin chains
25-08-2018T18:19:58,ThingsAreMoving,Keidran can use magic
25-08-2018T18:20:06,ThingsAreMoving,Basitins can't

25-08-2018T18:22:12,Ordithus,You don't mess with an adult dragon
25-08-2018T18:22:20,Twokinds,The only ones really with the power to do that would be the masks
25-08-2018T18:22:38,HobbitGames,Make itbhappen! please!
25-08-2018T18:22:40,unsteddyphoenix,Isnt her power similar to the masks?
25-08-2018T18:22:48,Twokinds,And the masks don't have authority over anyone but the mortals.
25-08-2018T18:22:56,ThingsAreMoving,Oooooh
25-08-2018T18:22:57,Twokinds,Which is why Nora doesn't take human form.
25-08-2018T18:22:59,HobbitGames,Ahh. Too ba
25-08-2018T18:23:02,HobbitGames,bad

25-08-2018T18:23:11,BadFoMo,That's why?
25-08-2018T18:23:11,unsteddyphoenix,Wait is she technically mortal while human?
25-08-2018T18:23:12,Bespin,Epic
25-08-2018T18:23:19,HobbitGames,From the loremaster himself
25-08-2018T18:23:20,ThingsAreMoving,that's why that mask couldn't do anything when Nora was 'playing with it's toys'
25-08-2018T18:23:23,Channelfiction,I wonder if the Masks get mad at Nora for her fun
25-08-2018T18:23:30,Bespin,Probably

25-08-2018T18:24:08,BadFoMo,"Wait, does she know that? If so, then how?"
25-08-2018T18:24:19,HobbitGames,"Ephimural is the ulttimate bad guy of the comic, are they?"
25-08-2018T18:24:26,unsteddyphoenix,Interesting.
25-08-2018T18:24:27,Ordithus,"Hehe now if I ever revisit that Neutral suggestion, that bird making a nest of his/her head is gonna be Nora"

25-08-2018T18:26:20,Twokinds,Nora has a pretty big ego.
25-08-2018T18:26:36,unsteddyphoenix,Justified
25-08-2018T18:26:39,Combak,"No, really?"
25-08-2018T18:26:40,Twokinds,She considers it insulting to be placed below the so-called demi-gods
25-08-2018T18:26:57,HobbitGames,"You know the way you arent allowed to wish for more wishes from a genie? Could you wish to travel between any reality you wishes whenever, which could be technically indirectly infinte wishes?"
25-08-2018T18:26:59,unsteddyphoenix,But in reality they ARE more powerful?
25-08-2018T18:27:00,Channelfiction,But she was afraid of Mary Silverlock?

25-08-2018T18:27:25,ThingsAreMoving,"Combak, or is it just roleplay?"
25-08-2018T18:27:34,Twokinds,no they are
25-08-2018T18:27:40,unsteddyphoenix,She only likes being dominated by people weaker than her

25-08-2018T20:11:51,ThingsAreMoving,he does have a point?

25-08-2018T20:13:00,Kodalynx,"Thanks! And I'll agree with that sentiment. Good dubstep is great for driving when you're seriously throwing it around. But there's a lot of bad dubstep out there, too. Way too many repeats without changing it up, just ""Where's the drop already""..."

25-08-2018T21:09:10,KiTA,There's a stream on youtube
25-08-2018T21:09:14,KiTA,it's called City Radio
25-08-2018T21:09:24,KiTA,Someone put a webcam under the hood of a Japanese taxi
25-08-2018T21:09:34,Corinthian,Man this is coming along nicely
25-08-2018T21:09:34,Mippy,XD Oh my gosh Commander
25-08-2018T21:09:36,nwroot,back did I miss anything?
25-08-2018T21:09:41,KiTA,"and they stream ""City pop"", which was a genre of music from Japan in the 80s"
25-08-2018T21:09:49,Bgrmystr2,"nothing out of the ordinary, nwroot"
25-08-2018T21:09:51,CommanderTrace,what?
25-08-2018T21:09:51,Twokinds,Also I sure wish Picarto let me gift other people subscriptions
25-08-2018T21:10:01,Twokinds,I'd love to just give them to people
25-08-2018T21:10:04,Bgrmystr2,do they not?
25-08-2018T21:10:09,KiTA,"""City Pop シティポップ RADIO"""
25-08-2018T21:10:09,RimaDraws,it wont?
25-08-2018T21:10:13,Twokinds,Like giveaways and stuff
25-08-2018T21:10:23,nwroot,What is the considered ordinary on this stream?
25-08-2018T21:10:29,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah it's weird since they HAVE a raffle system
25-08-2018T21:10:33,KiTA,"it's basically the most 80s anime-esque music you've ever heard, all designed to be driven to"
25-08-2018T21:10:34,unsteddyphoenix,But not a way to gift anything lol
25-08-2018T21:10:38,Bgrmystr2,"""Weird"" is pretty ordinary"
25-08-2018T21:10:45,ThingsAreMoving,it's in the works™
25-08-2018T21:10:53,Kodalynx,"Is it only on youtube, or on spotfiy as well?"
25-08-2018T21:11:05,ThingsAreMoving,picarto is a relatively young platform
25-08-2018T21:11:06,KiTA,City Pop?  No idea
25-08-2018T21:11:10,ShadowSoap,"Things like ""Normal"" and ""Ordinary"" are loosely defined in real life"
25-08-2018T21:11:22,Mippy,You are looking at it @nwroot
25-08-2018T21:11:27,ShadowSoap,Even harder to define it here
25-08-2018T21:11:43,KiTA,I'd share the link... but are we still not sharing links here?  thought it was a no no
25-08-2018T21:11:44,Kodalynx,"Can't really be driven to if it's only on youtube, hard to control that from most car stereo heads. :) Will take a look."
25-08-2018T21:11:45,unsteddyphoenix,Doesnt mean it should take them long to adopt preexisting ideas
25-08-2018T21:11:52,ThingsAreMoving,"we are normal, submit to our norms or perish."
25-08-2018T21:11:58,Bgrmystr2,ya gotta hang out in the chat and just.. see for yourself
25-08-2018T21:12:28,ThingsAreMoving,resistance is futile
25-08-2018T21:12:34,Bgrmystr2,"also, the no link without asking is from the multistream that sage hosts. That said, you usually don't see anyone linking anything generally."

25-08-2018T22:33:01,unsteddyphoenix,You're trying to say she has your plane taking off
25-08-2018T22:33:13,unsteddyphoenix,Or something of the like
25-08-2018T22:33:17,MuonNeutrino,the background on this one should be interesting
25-08-2018T22:33:28,ThingsAreMoving,roll for dodge
25-08-2018T22:33:33,unsteddyphoenix,She has your propeller spinning
25-08-2018T22:33:33,MuonNeutrino,?
25-08-2018T22:33:46,ferociousfox,"damn, beat me to that one unsteddy"
25-08-2018T22:33:47,Ordithus,Tom has drawn an aeromoplane before.  Turned out pretty nice actually
25-08-2018T22:33:50,unsteddyphoenix,She's...deploying your landing gear
25-08-2018T22:33:53,unsteddyphoenix,Idk about planes
25-08-2018T22:33:55,MuonNeutrino,he did a pretty good x-wing too
25-08-2018T22:34:03,CrRAR,lol
25-08-2018T22:34:10,ThingsAreMoving,aeromoplane?
25-08-2018T22:34:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"She's got you jumping off the deck, shoving into over drive"
25-08-2018T22:34:17,CrRAR,old plane?
25-08-2018T22:34:27,CrRAR,just needs lot o' rivets
25-08-2018T22:34:28,ThingsAreMoving,is that like an anthropomorfic airplane?
25-08-2018T22:34:33,CrimsonHelsing,Like an old C-47 mayhaps
25-08-2018T22:34:40,Ordithus,:ptv-nope:
25-08-2018T22:34:45,CrimsonHelsing,"good aircraft, very prominent in WWII"

25-08-2018T22:34:52,unsteddyphoenix,"I'd like to ""C"" HER 47"

25-08-2018T22:37:07,totallynotTrace,with a side of boobs in the chat
25-08-2018T22:37:23,DarthRexKing,Woof chest floof. o3o
25-08-2018T22:37:24,ThingsAreMoving,Don't remember much from that movie tbh
25-08-2018T22:37:43,ThingsAreMoving,and I'm not sure it aged well so I'm not gunna rewatch
25-08-2018T22:37:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I really only remember the song and the opening scene
25-08-2018T22:38:02,Ordithus,I don't think Rosie here could fasten that top button even if she wanted to
25-08-2018T22:38:22,CrRAR,indeed
25-08-2018T22:38:35,CrRAR,counterintuitive anyway
25-08-2018T22:38:42,Kodalynx,Top Gun sequel comes out next year.
25-08-2018T22:38:44,MuonNeutrino,"she probably could, fur compresses"
25-08-2018T22:38:47,Kodalynx,Same characters.
25-08-2018T22:38:48,unsteddyphoenix,I wonder if chest poof would have to be accounted for in cup size :thinking:
25-08-2018T22:38:51,MuonNeutrino,but why would you want her to? &gt;.&gt;
25-08-2018T22:39:06,Ordithus,A girl in a well-fit uniform is nice
25-08-2018T22:39:07,CrimsonHelsing,Top Gun sequel? that was cancelled.
25-08-2018T22:39:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Things, also the volley ball scene........ We need a TK top gun style volley ball scene"
25-08-2018T22:39:26,ThingsAreMoving,"cup size of which row, teddy?"
25-08-2018T22:39:34,Kodalynx,It was not.
25-08-2018T22:39:37,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RaineEep:
25-08-2018T22:39:38,TorqueEmUp,No it wasn't Crimson
25-08-2018T22:39:46,Kodalynx,They just finished filming on the USS Abraham Lincoln four daya ago.
25-08-2018T22:39:52,MuonNeutrino,@ThingsAreMoving only one row *has* a cup size =P

25-08-2018T22:40:07,CrRAR,nawww
25-08-2018T22:40:11,CrimsonHelsing,years ago
25-08-2018T22:40:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,no need for one unsteddy
25-08-2018T22:40:16,Ordithus,The spit-take would be a good emote
25-08-2018T22:40:21,ThingsAreMoving,Hrm
25-08-2018T22:40:31,Bgrmystr2,haha true ord
25-08-2018T22:40:34,Ordithus,You came at a wonderful time Cheese
25-08-2018T22:40:35,Kodalynx,"Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer are both in it, too."
25-08-2018T22:40:49,unsteddyphoenix,What if someone references keidran having 8 nipples marv
25-08-2018T22:40:51,unsteddyphoenix,WHAT THEN?
25-08-2018T22:40:52,Ordithus,Very relevant to this chat too
25-08-2018T22:40:56,TorqueEmUp,"It's called Top Gun: Maverick, and is still on for release next year."
25-08-2018T22:41:04,Kodalynx,Yep.
25-08-2018T22:41:06,TorqueEmUp,and the director is still very much alive from what I see
25-08-2018T22:41:18,Kodalynx,Kenny Logins wants to do a remix of That Song with a current artist.
25-08-2018T22:41:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,he did that in archer
25-08-2018T22:42:42,MuonNeutrino,"@TorqueEmUp apparently the original director died and the project was on hold for a while, but then got back on track"
25-08-2018T22:42:54,TorqueEmUp,That would make more sense
25-08-2018T22:43:31,Kodalynx,"Yah. Cruise will be playing Maverick, flight training Iceman's son...his RIO who got killed hittng the canopy. And Val Kilmer is still his rival."
25-08-2018T22:43:40,MuonNeutrino,man this is turning out good
25-08-2018T22:43:42,Kodalynx,"Goose, rather."
25-08-2018T22:43:48,Ordithus,Very
25-08-2018T22:43:49,Kodalynx,Val Kilmer is Iceman.
25-08-2018T22:43:53,TURlsgu,7 hour o_o
25-08-2018T22:44:09,TorqueEmUp,"I need to refresh on the original Top Gun, been a long while"
25-08-2018T22:44:18,TorqueEmUp,Last time I watched it was on a VHS tape. lol
25-08-2018T22:44:26,Kodalynx,There's not much. Fast planes and volleyball. :D
25-08-2018T22:44:32,MuonNeutrino,"on a completely unrelated topic, any mods for the tk forum in here? there's a spambot on the forums"
25-08-2018T22:44:53,Kodalynx,"Will just be Super Hornets instead of Tomcats now, but probably just as much plot. It's a Bruckheimer productions film."
25-08-2018T22:44:57,TorqueEmUp,"Oh I know, I still would like to rewatch it."
25-08-2018T22:45:07,KiTA,"Man, the strema has been buffering off and on all night"
25-08-2018T22:45:19,CrRAR,s'okay here
25-08-2018T22:45:25,ThingsAreMoving,all good here
25-08-2018T22:45:38,CheeseRS,"Mine doesn't buffer, it's the PC taht lags :&lt;"
25-08-2018T22:45:39,MuonNeutrino,"i've gotten some buffering, but that's because my internet is shit"
25-08-2018T22:45:52,CheeseRS,that* idek how that happened
25-08-2018T22:45:58,totallynotTrace,yeah every minute or so itle just stop and buffer for 1-2 seconds
25-08-2018T22:46:08,TorqueEmUp,"Tom Cruise and fighter jets, I could care less if the story was just a rehash. :P"
25-08-2018T22:46:14,Kodalynx,Get the blu-ray and watch it on a surround-equipped system. The air dogfights are still awesome in that.
25-08-2018T22:46:27,ThingsAreMoving,set your dns to 1.1.1.1 helps a bit with the stream
25-08-2018T22:46:45,ThingsAreMoving,"if you don't know how, google it"
25-08-2018T22:47:03,KiTA,"Nah, cloudflare DNS blocks archive.is,"
25-08-2018T22:47:08,KiTA,and I use that site sometimes
25-08-2018T22:47:21,CrimsonHelsing,"if they have dogfights in this one against foreign aircraft, let's hope they're legit foreign aircraft this time xD Unlike the ""Mig-28"" *cough*F-5*cough* filling the role of the MiG-21 xD"
25-08-2018T22:47:23,CrRAR,Google DND is 8.8.8.8 I think
25-08-2018T22:47:28,CrRAR,*DNS
25-08-2018T22:47:28,ThingsAreMoving,well you can change the dns when you need to use that site
25-08-2018T22:47:29,totallynotTrace,unfortunatly my router forces me to use comcast dns even when i manuallly enter dns addresses
25-08-2018T22:47:40,KiTA,That's... worrying
25-08-2018T22:47:50,CrRAR,haha
25-08-2018T22:47:52,TorqueEmUp,Yeah google's is 8.8.8.8  and 8.8.4.4
25-08-2018T22:47:59,Kodalynx,They have CG now for that. Whatever they use can be digitally replaced with a MiG-29 or whatever.
25-08-2018T22:48:09,TorqueEmUp,so you can let google track you some more.
25-08-2018T22:48:14,CrRAR,hahaha
25-08-2018T22:48:45,TorqueEmUp,personally tracking me is worthless
25-08-2018T22:48:49,TorqueEmUp,so I don't care. lol
25-08-2018T22:48:53,ThingsAreMoving,^

25-08-2018T22:49:42,unsteddyphoenix,"""he's going on THE LIST"""
25-08-2018T22:49:44,Kodalynx,That's some challenging perspective for a wing or such. Especially if you're trying to do a nacelle.
25-08-2018T22:49:44,CrimsonHelsing,@Twokinds want me to link you a good WWII aircraft to use as reference?
25-08-2018T22:49:49,Combak,"Information gathering is how Picarto, Discord, and Google in general makes most of their money."
25-08-2018T22:49:58,Combak,I think the term is data brokering?
25-08-2018T22:49:58,TorqueEmUp,I am sure he is already using one Crimson
25-08-2018T22:50:04,CrimsonHelsing,oh
25-08-2018T22:50:04,CrRAR,Clearly they are probably extremely confused as how to advertise to us.
25-08-2018T22:50:07,CrimsonHelsing,nvm
25-08-2018T22:50:18,totallynotTrace,"its funny, I watch a lot of supercar reviews so I keep getting ads for stuff like the honda nsx. good luck selling that to a student that doesnt even own a car :/"
25-08-2018T22:50:22,Ordithus,He had looked up nose art at some point
25-08-2018T22:50:27,ThingsAreMoving,lack of ads is best ad for me
25-08-2018T22:50:34,CrRAR,haha tnT
25-08-2018T22:50:35,Ordithus,NSX is a very very expensive car
25-08-2018T22:50:38,Kodalynx,Old NSX looks better anyway. Has that McLaren profile. :)
25-08-2018T22:50:42,Ordithus,^
25-08-2018T22:51:08,TheDogKing,TROLOLOLOLOL
25-08-2018T22:51:18,TheBeckoner,Old NSX ftw
25-08-2018T22:51:23,Ordithus,"Yep, looks like Tom's got a good reference"
25-08-2018T22:51:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,*Sits in the supra corner.*
25-08-2018T22:51:38,CrRAR,Yeah sometimes in redesigns their attempted differentiation sux
25-08-2018T22:51:42,Kodalynx,"You can pick up an early 90's one that needs some TLC for about $30K or so. Nice thing is that only the engine is exotic. The rest is off the shelf Acura parts, so you can afford to own it."
25-08-2018T22:51:43,TheBeckoner,Supras are good too Marv
25-08-2018T22:51:47,CrimsonHelsing,"indeed, looks like a B-17 possibly"
25-08-2018T22:51:47,TorqueEmUp,I saw an old 1st gen Supra the other day.
25-08-2018T22:51:58,totallynotTrace,its funny ive gotten to sit in 3 'super cars' and ive gotten ads for all of them
25-08-2018T22:51:59,CrimsonHelsing,oooor...
25-08-2018T22:52:02,CrimsonHelsing,a fighter
25-08-2018T22:52:02,Ordithus,Supra or Celica Supra?
25-08-2018T22:52:08,TheBeckoner,Both?
25-08-2018T22:52:14,MarvTheHugPharaoh,87 supra ftw
25-08-2018T22:52:16,Ordithus,"Single engine, at least"
25-08-2018T22:52:19,Kodalynx,"Supras are awesome. I have its tuxedo cousin, a lovingly restored black Lexus SC400. Love that thing."
25-08-2018T22:52:30,TheBeckoner,Nice on the 400
25-08-2018T22:52:33,totallynotTrace,actually call that 2 cuz i8 isnt a supercar
25-08-2018T22:52:45,MuonNeutrino,yeah definitely not a b17
25-08-2018T22:52:45,Ordithus,A friend of mine has a JDM Mk IV Supra
25-08-2018T22:52:51,Ordithus,Is very neat
25-08-2018T22:52:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Noice
25-08-2018T22:53:00,CrimsonHelsing,"P-36... no, no, bubbled canopy. P-51, maybe, or a 47"
25-08-2018T22:53:13,TorqueEmUp,Hell I've seen quite a few super cars lately when I've been doing deliveries.
25-08-2018T22:53:16,Ordithus,It has a strange tip-tronic type automatic... I didn't know that existed then
25-08-2018T22:53:21,MuonNeutrino,canopy looks about right for a mustang
25-08-2018T22:53:23,totallynotTrace,most recently i sat in a mclaren 720s. OOOOOOoooo my
25-08-2018T22:53:32,MuonNeutrino,nose is a bit short for a p51 tho
25-08-2018T22:53:43,MuonNeutrino,definitely the right canopy tho
25-08-2018T22:53:53,Kodalynx,"People have put a Powerglide in a Supra. Those don't just accelerate, they jump to lightspeed."
25-08-2018T22:53:55,TorqueEmUp,Got pictures of a Mclaren 650S at my local mall
25-08-2018T22:54:01,CrimsonHelsing,"yep, it's gotta be a 47"
25-08-2018T22:54:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,v8 powerglide?
25-08-2018T22:54:33,MuonNeutrino,"hm, could be a 47, that had a prett similar canopy"
25-08-2018T22:54:42,Kodalynx,"Yeah, they've managed to get them into turbo Supras. Look for ""supra from hell"" on youtube to see what that does."
25-08-2018T22:54:46,TorqueEmUp,and got a picture of a Lamborhini Gallardo a few days ago.
25-08-2018T22:54:49,Ordithus,Interesting choice if it's a P47
25-08-2018T22:55:02,MuonNeutrino,wings not in quite ther ight place for that but v0v
25-08-2018T22:55:16,Ordithus,I saw someone driving a Lambo in town a few months back.  All I could think about were the potholes
25-08-2018T22:55:17,TorqueEmUp,Ehh stop nitpicking :P
25-08-2018T22:55:21,CrimsonHelsing,well posters don't always get the plane picture perfect anyway
25-08-2018T22:55:24,totallynotTrace,i go to a large charity car show every year put on by a Ferrari dealership so i get to take hundreads of pics a year of these dream cars
25-08-2018T22:55:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I ask power glide because that is a chevy transmission found in the 1st gen camaro
25-08-2018T22:55:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,a 2 speed
25-08-2018T22:55:50,Kodalynx,It is. Supra gearheads have found ways to use it. :)
25-08-2018T22:55:52,TorqueEmUp,I like seeing these cars in the wild more than at car shows.
25-08-2018T22:55:53,MuonNeutrino,"yeah, i don't expect tom to draw a wwii fighter plane with every detail perfect heh"
25-08-2018T22:55:57,Ordithus,Tom isn't the most practiced at aircraft.  Give him time

25-08-2018T22:56:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"the w58 that the supras come with is much stronger and can take more hp, why would you ditch it :ptv-scratch:"
25-08-2018T22:56:46,Kodalynx,"Sort of. The SC gets about 16mpg on 93 octane, so it's not a daily driver, but weekend yes."
25-08-2018T22:57:07,Ordithus,@Marv I also don't understand people that stick v8s into RX7s
