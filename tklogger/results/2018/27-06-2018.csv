27-06-2018T16:21:49,iliar,I'm a stalker. When normal stalkers delve in the basket with underwear. I'm sitting on a tree with binoculars and see what you draw)
27-06-2018T16:22:40,Xexanoth,"you should watch out though, we just had someone sitting in a tree who seriously regretted her decision"
27-06-2018T16:22:57,Bgrmystr2,lol.. top-tier guessing going on here

27-06-2018T16:49:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Galaxys are nice
27-06-2018T16:49:38,TheFDdriver,They are
27-06-2018T16:50:18,SpazztasticKiwi,One of the phones I considered until the company said that the ‚Äúfree phone‚Äù they offer was exclusively the iPhone
27-06-2018T16:50:49,Dadrobit,"Ohhh, I want one of those S9's. My old Droid Turbo 2 is on its way out :("
27-06-2018T16:50:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Which is fine
27-06-2018T16:51:01,Dadrobit,"Also, howdy y'all."
27-06-2018T16:51:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Turbo not so turbo anymore?
27-06-2018T16:51:20,TheFDdriver,Hello Dadro
27-06-2018T16:51:25,Dadrobit,"Still Turbo charges, just also turbo depletes."
27-06-2018T16:51:38,TheFDdriver,My S6 is on its last
27-06-2018T16:51:40,Dadrobit,And doesn't perfor so wel in apps anymore either...

27-06-2018T16:52:38,Dadrobit,"The S9+ looks sexy as all get out, but I also gotta consider the dosh as much as I want one."
27-06-2018T16:52:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Phone like üë¥
27-06-2018T16:53:11,Dadrobit,Prolly wait until the next gen pops out and they cut the price some more.
27-06-2018T16:53:22,Dadrobit,It's already been out for a while right?
27-06-2018T16:53:27,TheFDdriver,I didn't went for the plus because my small hands
27-06-2018T16:53:33,SpazztasticKiwi,No idea
27-06-2018T16:53:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Do you have....
27-06-2018T16:53:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Special hands
27-06-2018T16:53:53,TheFDdriver,No
27-06-2018T16:53:57,Dadrobit,It's not his brand.
27-06-2018T16:54:06,TheFDdriver,They're just small
27-06-2018T16:54:48,SpazztasticKiwi,What‚Äôs it‚Äôs dimensions
27-06-2018T16:56:13,Dadrobit,6.2 inches.
27-06-2018T16:56:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Tall right
27-06-2018T16:56:34,Dadrobit,18.5:9 aspect ratio
27-06-2018T16:56:52,SpazztasticKiwi,My 6s plus is 6 inches tall
27-06-2018T16:57:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Not including any case of course
27-06-2018T16:57:49,TheFDdriver,Thats big
27-06-2018T16:58:59,SpazztasticKiwi,It was a quick check
27-06-2018T16:59:31,Dadrobit,Trading in my DT2 knocks off 25% of the price to a bit under 30$ a month. But still.
27-06-2018T16:59:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I used my ruler cause I make phone case designs when I change them out
27-06-2018T17:00:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Probably just gonna put my name on this case though
27-06-2018T17:00:44,Vatruvius,Gah...so many updates with only 5mbps DSL!
27-06-2018T17:00:53,SpazztasticKiwi,When I nail down how I want to lay it out
27-06-2018T17:02:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Well why‚Äôd you wait so long to do them
27-06-2018T17:03:04,Vatruvius,Seriously?!
27-06-2018T17:03:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Yep
27-06-2018T17:03:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Don‚Äôt you know you should be able to update even if your computer isn‚Äôt there?
27-06-2018T17:03:56,SpazztasticKiwi,(I‚Äôm completely kidding if that‚Äôs not clear)
27-06-2018T17:03:56,Dadrobit,That's something Tom would point out.
27-06-2018T17:05:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Guess I beat him to it then
27-06-2018T17:06:34,Dadrobit,"Also, it's funny seeing Tom's B-day pop up on the forums. Looking at his profile and seeing stuff like ""Beginner YouTuber""."
27-06-2018T17:06:39,Dadrobit,Mark***
27-06-2018T17:07:01,SpazztasticKiwi,How did that screw up happen
27-06-2018T17:07:53,Dadrobit,Very easily it would seem.
27-06-2018T17:08:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I woke up to Twitter going on about it
27-06-2018T17:09:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Dude‚Äôs 29 and acts half
27-06-2018T17:10:26,Dadrobit,"Important to note the ""act"" aspect of that statement. Dude's an actor/entertainor, Tom only knows what he's like moment to moment."
27-06-2018T17:10:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I know
27-06-2018T17:12:03,SpazztasticKiwi,He definitely wasn‚Äôt acting as he does on video at East
27-06-2018T17:12:05,Vatruvius,Guess who is typing on their computer right now...this guy!

27-06-2018T17:16:36,Vatruvius,How very interesting...
27-06-2018T17:17:11,Vatruvius,I am now getting those black bars on the stream like you talked about Bgr with the site update.
27-06-2018T17:17:18,Vatruvius,Didn't use to...
27-06-2018T17:17:20,Vatruvius,Hmm...
27-06-2018T17:17:30,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-SteelwormHades: I heard me
27-06-2018T17:17:30,SpazztasticKiwi,The site did update didn‚Äôt it
27-06-2018T17:17:38,Vatruvius,No matter...a little tweaking of the chat window fixes that.
27-06-2018T17:18:02,Bgrmystr2,"well, the chat window doesn't make the bars go away, it only makes em worse :/"
27-06-2018T17:18:12,Vatruvius,Not you...I was talking about a different Bgr...gah!
27-06-2018T17:18:42,Bgrmystr2,what other Bgr is there? :ptv-unimpressed:
27-06-2018T17:18:47,Vatruvius,"Well, for me tweaking the chat window makes it so they disappear...you have to hit the sweet spot."
27-06-2018T17:18:51,SpazztasticKiwi,CheeseBgr
27-06-2018T17:18:58,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-angry: *[THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE]
27-06-2018T17:19:22,Vatruvius,To big a chat results in horizontal bars and to small a chat results in vertical bars.
27-06-2018T17:19:29,Vatruvius,So I put the chat right inbetween.
27-06-2018T17:19:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Fine. I‚Äôll have the CheeseBgr and you can have a salad
27-06-2018T17:19:52,Bgrmystr2,the problem isn't the black bars on the left/right side of the stream
27-06-2018T17:19:59,Bgrmystr2,is the bars above and below it
27-06-2018T17:20:13,Bgrmystr2,they are what cause the stream to be smaller
27-06-2018T17:20:15,Vatruvius,I suppose...but I got it so there are no bars. :D
27-06-2018T17:20:35,Bgrmystr2,betcha anything the bars I'm talkin about are still there :P
27-06-2018T17:20:39,Vatruvius,That window really should be a scalable thing though.
27-06-2018T17:20:51,Vatruvius,scale-able*
27-06-2018T17:21:02,Vatruvius,Um...no.
27-06-2018T17:21:23,Vatruvius,Here...I will send you an image via Discord.
27-06-2018T17:22:58,Vatruvius,And it is sending right now.
27-06-2018T17:24:16,Bgrmystr2,"eeeyup I can see them, they're still there. :v"
27-06-2018T17:24:47,Vatruvius,Wait...what bars then?
27-06-2018T17:25:10,Vatruvius,You mean the border around the stream window?
27-06-2018T17:25:45,Bgrmystr2,will show you give me a sec
27-06-2018T17:26:34,Vatruvius,Of course Rainbow Six: Siege has a 6.3 GB update! Realy!

27-06-2018T17:30:14,Vatruvius,Well yeah...it's just that R6:S has really big updates whenever it does update.
27-06-2018T17:31:16,Bgrmystr2,The big ass red ones.
27-06-2018T17:31:46,Bgrmystr2,in case anyone else is curious https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/428739191526916107/462022158432993300/Bars_of_in_the_way.png
27-06-2018T17:32:00,Vatruvius,Ohh...you mean the content bars...not sure what you would call those.
27-06-2018T17:32:03,Bgrmystr2,"Green box was the stream size originally, blue box was the chat size"
27-06-2018T17:32:16,Bgrmystr2,and the red bars are what they added to scrunch everything smaller.
27-06-2018T17:32:22,Vatruvius,They don't bug me. I was talking about black bars in the stream window like a cinematic movie has bars and sugh.
27-06-2018T17:32:23,Bgrmystr2,they did not add ANY new information to it.
27-06-2018T17:32:47,Bgrmystr2,the bars I highlighted are what causes the stream to have the black borders lol
27-06-2018T17:32:58,Bgrmystr2,otherwise it would fit fine
27-06-2018T17:33:40,Vatruvius,Maybe? I think they just need to let the stream window scale according to what space is left from the adjustable chat window.
27-06-2018T17:34:04,Bgrmystr2,"they added UI /simply/ to add UI. They didn't add anything new to it, it's just new bars for the sake of new bars"
27-06-2018T17:34:14,Bgrmystr2,and it makes the default stream window smaller.
27-06-2018T17:35:07,Vatruvius,"I mean, it is not that much smaller. Unless you have a very small monitor/screen to begin with."
27-06-2018T17:35:17,Bgrmystr2,it actually is very much smaller.
27-06-2018T17:35:31,Vatruvius,"What, more than 10%?"
27-06-2018T17:36:45,Bgrmystr2,it's the difference between 1189x668 vs 1607x833
27-06-2018T17:36:58,Bgrmystr2,that's a fairly big difference
27-06-2018T17:38:52,Bgrmystr2,"it's about 15% loss on height, and about 40% on width"
27-06-2018T17:41:36,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, gotta shut down my pc and install a wireless card to do some troubleshooting. But will be on discord and lurking offline on here :u"
27-06-2018T17:41:38,Xexanoth,"to be fair, i think they expect people to use fullscreen wenn watching"
27-06-2018T17:41:41,Vatruvius,"Alright, so it may be a bit of a loss on screen size but even then I find the current stream window, at least for how it displays on my screen, perfectly acceptable for a stream. Granted, I do not watch multiple streams. I just can't with my DSL."
27-06-2018T17:41:51,Vatruvius,I hop from one to the other.
27-06-2018T18:14:18,Bgrmystr2,hmm

27-06-2018T20:54:46,iliar,* This is silly. But some sketches that I want to color only for the sake of Nibs.

27-06-2018T21:01:16,CrRAR,I feel like he could do a mean eyebrow waggle. Any others you could think that epitomizes Sythe?

27-06-2018T21:25:07,SpazztasticKiwi,You know guys I was curious about why Freddy‚Äôs called Freddy
27-06-2018T21:25:23,SpazztasticKiwi,His full name is Fredrick Charles
27-06-2018T21:26:32,unsteddyphoenix,what a fun fact
27-06-2018T21:26:52,SpazztasticKiwi,It sounds so sophisticated for a guy with knife fingers
27-06-2018T21:27:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though who could take a murderer seriously with a name like ‚ÄúFredrick‚Äù. ‚ÄúFredrick is coming!‚Äù ‚ÄúFor what, dinner?‚Äù"
27-06-2018T21:28:20,Ordithus,Fredrique
27-06-2018T21:29:15,Ordithus,Kills with baguettes
27-06-2018T21:29:27,SpazztasticKiwi,And a pinky out
27-06-2018T21:31:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Not many of the horror series villains have full names either
27-06-2018T21:32:59,unsteddyphoenix,"Wait so his last name isnt ""Krueger""?"
27-06-2018T21:37:50,Ordithus,I think you are right
27-06-2018T21:47:56,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs Fredrick Charles Krueger
27-06-2018T21:48:26,SpazztasticKiwi,He‚Äôs one of the maybe three I know from full series
27-06-2018T21:52:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh and I want to ask something that I‚Äôve had proposed to me
27-06-2018T21:52:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Do you tip the servers at Sonic
27-06-2018T21:56:23,Ordithus,I've never been to a Sonic
27-06-2018T21:57:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Well I‚Äôve heard you can and you should if you can
27-06-2018T21:57:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"But at the same time, at McDonald‚Äôs, you could get in trouble if you accepted tips, so"
27-06-2018T21:58:31,Ordithus,"Tips have to be tracked, they count as income for tax purposes"
27-06-2018T21:58:35,CrRAR,yeah I guess it depends... you probably would just have to as the server person.
27-06-2018T21:59:02,CrRAR,"tbh, tips are always welcome unless forbade by management. :("
27-06-2018T21:59:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"That‚Äôs the thing, if they‚Äôre not allowed, they have to say no"
27-06-2018T21:59:17,Ordithus,"Yeah, that would be why they would forbid them"
27-06-2018T21:59:20,CrRAR,yeah
27-06-2018T21:59:32,SpazztasticKiwi,And you risk getting them in trouble if caught
27-06-2018T21:59:50,CrRAR,yeah
27-06-2018T22:00:35,CrRAR,it's dumb because in the old days EVERY food place fast food/dunkin donuts/ whatever had tip cups.
27-06-2018T22:00:45,unsteddyphoenix,Man tipping is so much THINKING
27-06-2018T22:00:51,CrRAR,lol
27-06-2018T22:01:30,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-renirawr: Fiend!  You are being apprehended for tax evasion
27-06-2018T22:01:38,CrRAR,xD
27-06-2018T22:01:44,CrRAR,The law is though that IF you're being paid as a server/waitstaff you can get tips.
27-06-2018T22:02:10,CrRAR,"The fact that the Sonic folks are minimum wage indeed, forbids that."
27-06-2018T22:02:48,Ordithus,Wages get weird when tips are involved
27-06-2018T22:02:51,CrRAR,"Small shops like coffee shops/mom and pops still put out tip cups usually though even for the counter staff,"
27-06-2018T22:02:51,unsteddyphoenix,"""pay the court a tip or serve your sentence!"""
27-06-2018T22:02:56,CrRAR,mmm
27-06-2018T22:03:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Just transported a spider the size of my thumb off my car

27-06-2018T22:04:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I used a cup
27-06-2018T22:04:18,Ordithus,Jumping spiders are incredible little hunters
27-06-2018T22:04:24,CrRAR,and their eyes are adoreable
27-06-2018T22:04:36,CrRAR,With that agility I BELIEVE IT.
27-06-2018T22:04:38,Ordithus,I was worried you picked it up :ptv-nope:
27-06-2018T22:04:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Jumping spiders are much cute
27-06-2018T22:05:04,CrRAR,I wish I could have a giant one as a pet. ;_;
27-06-2018T22:05:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless it‚Äôs a wee spider - like a jumping spider - no
27-06-2018T22:05:15,unsteddyphoenix,Spiders are cute tbh

27-06-2018T23:34:22,unsteddyphoenix,I wonder if Elizabeth is still king of the pirates :thinking:
27-06-2018T23:34:55,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-kingtea:
27-06-2018T23:35:49,CrRAR,"Ohhh, I confused ""Orphan"" with ""The Unborn"" for some reason in my head. That's the one I heard was lousy."
27-06-2018T23:36:31,CrRAR,"huh, even came out same year."
27-06-2018T23:36:44,CrRAR,Thaaaaat explains some things.
27-06-2018T23:37:37,CrRAR,Yeah what happened with the pirates franchise is they dragged out the same formula too long.
27-06-2018T23:38:13,CrRAR,Pirates vs Freaky Supernatural Stuff vs Dorks with Fancy Ships vs the Kraken
27-06-2018T23:38:40,CrRAR,(hint: the Kraken always wins)

27-06-2018T23:43:42,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-natanisleep:
27-06-2018T23:45:15,SpazztasticKiwi,How it is with most series
27-06-2018T23:45:42,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs a point where it should wrap up
27-06-2018T23:46:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Like Saw has technically ended. It should be done
27-06-2018T23:46:36,SpazztasticKiwi,But they‚Äôre making another one. I‚Äôm just wondering how they‚Äôre continuing it and where they‚Äôre taking it
27-06-2018T23:50:16,unsteddyphoenix,Wait Saw had an overarching plot?
27-06-2018T23:53:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you watch all of them, every character is connected"
27-06-2018T23:53:52,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs a reason they‚Äôre all chosen
27-06-2018T23:53:55,unsteddyphoenix,"Like, red strings held up by pins, conspiracy connected?"
27-06-2018T23:54:05,SpazztasticKiwi,About like that
27-06-2018T23:56:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"If John had been granted his cancer treatment, many would still be alive"
27-06-2018T23:56:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"And if that drug addict hadn‚Äôt caused the death of his son, he and a few others would be too"
27-06-2018T23:57:28,unsteddyphoenix,Huh. Interesting~
27-06-2018T23:57:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I need to watch those again
27-06-2018T23:57:35,unsteddyphoenix,I like stuff like that.
27-06-2018T23:57:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I like thicc plots and I cannot lie
27-06-2018T23:57:53,unsteddyphoenix,Big same.
27-06-2018T23:58:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Guess that‚Äôs why I like Voorhees
27-06-2018T23:58:23,SpazztasticKiwi,And Krueger
27-06-2018T23:58:34,SpazztasticKiwi,They have background and a story behind them
27-06-2018T23:58:37,unsteddyphoenix,Guess I havent been giving horror films enough credit
