24-07-2018T17:32:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Didn‚Äôt you say you‚Äôd be spending the day with sunscreen
24-07-2018T17:33:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Or did that get left at home
24-07-2018T18:08:23,Dadrobit,All the suncreen happened. I am medium rare instead of well done.
24-07-2018T18:08:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"Take a nice, steamy hot bath. It‚Äôll relax you"

24-07-2018T18:46:07,Ordithus,If he starts attacking your ankles then you know he needs attention
24-07-2018T18:46:13,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs a worry that I‚Äôm gonna fall on him and break a bone someday
24-07-2018T18:48:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"It‚Äôs a given that if I‚Äôm at home, he‚Äôs with a few feet of me"

24-07-2018T19:46:07,SpazztasticKiwi,The cut was a little deeper than it looked
24-07-2018T19:46:26,NightMeaty22,Did not feel it tell i looked at it
24-07-2018T19:47:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"It didn‚Äôt start throbbing till I started putting on the pressure. If I hadn‚Äôt been looking at my hand when it cut, I may not have felt it as bad either"

24-07-2018T19:50:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"When Tom mentioned he was drawing Raine in a tux, I just imagined her with a tux on for some random reason"
24-07-2018T19:50:24,Ordithus,She looks great
24-07-2018T19:52:18,NightMeaty22,I cut my thumb while trimming a piece to go next to the wall so it was running

24-07-2018T19:54:08,unsteddyphoenix,Guess I never considered it...
24-07-2018T19:54:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Necklaces are nice but a tie is too close
24-07-2018T19:55:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôve considered trying my hand at cross dressing, but I suck at acting male"
24-07-2018T19:56:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Some can cross dress and it‚Äôs like ‚Äúgreat. Someone who‚Äôs more attractive as both genders‚Äù
24-07-2018T19:56:54,Ordithus,lol
24-07-2018T19:57:54,FuryFaZeFurry,"whens teh next comic page, i would think its before friday because of SDCC"
24-07-2018T19:57:55,Ordithus,Women tuxes are a thing though
24-07-2018T19:58:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah to allow more boob room and such
24-07-2018T19:59:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Though there‚Äôs the real cool cross dressing that makes you question your eyes
24-07-2018T20:01:48,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah you need like
24-07-2018T20:01:57,unsteddyphoenix,The correct cheekbones?

24-07-2018T20:02:18,unsteddyphoenix,Then theyre more attractive than you no matter what gender you are feels bad~
24-07-2018T20:02:45,Ordithus,Attractive people are attractive
24-07-2018T20:03:05,unsteddyphoenix,I know...

24-07-2018T20:11:37,Ordithus,It's a demon
24-07-2018T20:12:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Not a fan of seagulls myself either
24-07-2018T20:13:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"I like to sit at the beach and listen to the waves, not ‚ÄúAHHHH AHHH AHHH AHHHH‚Äù"
24-07-2018T20:14:22,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
24-07-2018T20:14:26,Ordithus,A seagull once stole my pretzel.
24-07-2018T20:14:32,unsteddyphoenix,Theyre just background noise to me at this point
24-07-2018T20:19:01,Bgrmystr2,"if the seagulls don't yell ""MINE!?"" they aren't seagull enough for me."
24-07-2018T20:22:39,Ordithus,Flying rats
24-07-2018T20:23:34,TorqueEmUp,Seagulls are disgusting
24-07-2018T20:24:01,TorqueEmUp,"Noisy, greedy, and shit all over eveything."
24-07-2018T20:24:17,TorqueEmUp,I'll take pidgeons over seagulls anyday
24-07-2018T20:24:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember one time we went to Mobile Bay and fed and watched the seagulls
24-07-2018T20:24:56,SpazztasticKiwi,One shat on my pants
24-07-2018T20:25:12,Ordithus,how rude
24-07-2018T20:25:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Ungrateful bastards
24-07-2018T20:26:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Haven‚Äôt been to the beach in awhile now. Too far and I don‚Äôt like all the sand getting in your everywhere
24-07-2018T20:30:38,unsteddyphoenix,It's coarse and rough and irritating too
24-07-2018T20:31:05,Ordithus,I like the beach :ptv-sad:
24-07-2018T20:33:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh I like it too
24-07-2018T20:33:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I just like it to stay out of my pants without a date
24-07-2018T20:35:40,unsteddyphoenix,See I dont really like it
24-07-2018T20:35:56,unsteddyphoenix,But beaches are everywhere I cant escape them!
24-07-2018T20:38:18,Ordithus,There are a lot more beaches near to me than I thought.
24-07-2018T20:39:20,Ordithus,Every little community up the shore seems to have one.  I had thought the shore was too rocky for that.
24-07-2018T20:52:17,SpazztasticKiwi,This oddly reminds me that my cousin is going to have the results of whether kid number 5 is another boy or the girl she‚Äôs been trying so hard for
24-07-2018T20:54:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Tomorrow we find out if she‚Äôs got her goal or is gonna try again
24-07-2018T21:03:02,TorqueEmUp,"Hate to be ""that guy"" but that's a lot of kids just because she wants a girl"
24-07-2018T21:05:36,Ordithus,Alllll ze babies!
24-07-2018T21:05:48,SpazztasticKiwi,You are not the only one thinking that
24-07-2018T21:06:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"Her mom, our aunt, and half the family does too"
24-07-2018T21:07:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"If I have a kid, I‚Äôd like a girl, but I‚Äôm not popping out 4+ boys to do it"
24-07-2018T21:11:42,TorqueEmUp,I think just about every single girl out there wants to have a girl.
24-07-2018T21:11:55,TorqueEmUp,"Even my mom did, but stopped after have two boys."
24-07-2018T21:12:59,TorqueEmUp,My dad didn't want a girl because they are a pain in the ass. :P
24-07-2018T21:13:09,TorqueEmUp,so he says anyway
24-07-2018T21:16:07,TorqueEmUp,"Also don't know if it's true or not, but if the father is a heavy coffee drinker, that makes having a boys more likely."
24-07-2018T21:16:31,TorqueEmUp,Probably why all 4 of my dad's sons are boys. lol
24-07-2018T21:17:11,TorqueEmUp,he has multiple cups of straight coffee everyday.
24-07-2018T21:17:15,unsteddyphoenix,Thats true. Also if you have the baby on the night of a full moon its more likely to be a girl
24-07-2018T21:17:45,TorqueEmUp,"That I dunno about, that has no scientific basis to back it up."
24-07-2018T21:17:49,TorqueEmUp,lol
24-07-2018T21:18:00,unsteddyphoenix,No its true
24-07-2018T21:18:10,TorqueEmUp,"Maybe if concieved on a full moon, but that still a stretch."
24-07-2018T21:18:14,Ordithus,I thought those babies were more... hairy than usual.
24-07-2018T21:18:22,TorqueEmUp,My little brother was born on a full moon.
24-07-2018T21:18:34,unsteddyphoenix,But not if you do it upside down
24-07-2018T21:18:50,unsteddyphoenix,Then ita more likely to be a guy
24-07-2018T21:19:03,unsteddyphoenix,Its very complicaterld
24-07-2018T21:19:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"Both my parents were happy with having a girl first, but both hoped I‚Äôd be a boy"
24-07-2018T21:19:57,SpazztasticKiwi,That didn‚Äôt happen
24-07-2018T21:21:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"What the kicker is that the docs were like ‚Äúit‚Äôs likely a boy‚Äù. I was born in the blue delivery room, blue blanket ready"
24-07-2018T21:24:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"There‚Äôs a lot of theories to help predict and control what the baby‚Äôs gonna be. With a 50/50 shot, it‚Äôs hard to miss but some people miss hard"
24-07-2018T21:28:45,TorqueEmUp,"Genetically, it's not really 50/50"
24-07-2018T21:29:12,TorqueEmUp,"I believe there is a higher chance at girls, but it's ever so slightly"
24-07-2018T21:29:39,TorqueEmUp,"Then again I could be confusing the general world population, with birth rates."
