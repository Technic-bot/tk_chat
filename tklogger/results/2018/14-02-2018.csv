14-02-2018T00:41:28,Combak,Nice.
14-02-2018T00:41:28,Twokinds,Why have I been drawing this stream for the entire duration
14-02-2018T00:41:36,Exwum,you do it like
14-02-2018T00:41:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,good question
14-02-2018T00:41:38,Exwum,so many times
14-02-2018T00:41:49,SpazztasticKiwi,You‚Äôve been sleep drawing this entire time
14-02-2018T00:41:59,Exwum,i actually ask how streamers are able to stream for so long
14-02-2018T00:42:00,Exwum,i mean
14-02-2018T00:42:04,SpazztasticKiwi,*mystical fingers*
14-02-2018T00:42:13,ZRO4825,Tom sleep-draws better than most of us draw perfectly wide awake and on 3 cups of expresso.
14-02-2018T00:42:13,Exwum,"i know why, but whenever i stream i'm very rarely able to get over a hour"
14-02-2018T00:42:17,unsteddyphoenix,He just woke up lol
14-02-2018T00:42:29,unsteddyphoenix,I think 3 cups might be detrimental
14-02-2018T00:42:34,ZRO4825,He's only been drawing for not quite 2 hours this time. That's actually kinda short for Tom. o_o
14-02-2018T00:42:52,Exwum,yeah i saw the other comic streams
14-02-2018T00:42:56,Exwum,they're like 4 hours long
14-02-2018T00:43:32,unsteddyphoenix,Oof I forgot how offensively bright Karens hair is
14-02-2018T00:43:32,SpazztasticKiwi,This is my ‚Äútry not to get satisfied‚Äù challenge
14-02-2018T00:43:48,unsteddyphoenix,Need to put on shades

14-02-2018T00:44:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Kinda want pink & green now

14-02-2018T00:45:17,unsteddyphoenix,technically true :thinking:
14-02-2018T00:45:50,Unenlagia,The best kind of true
14-02-2018T00:46:00,SpazztasticKiwi,"streaks, not full head"
14-02-2018T00:46:20,ZRO4825,Must go full pink and watermelon. Be like an alternate coloration of Stocking.
14-02-2018T00:46:22,unsteddyphoenix,Ohh. That could be cool then
14-02-2018T00:46:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"She‚Äôs covered for st Patrick‚Äôs day, at least"
14-02-2018T00:47:13,Bgrmystr2,xD

14-02-2018T00:48:50,unsteddyphoenix,If she ever graduates from potato-sack chic that should be her next shirt
14-02-2018T00:48:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Dear Jesus I just looked up from chat. I need that shirt
14-02-2018T00:49:21,CrRAR,Reni's astonishment in panel 2 is unmatched.

14-02-2018T00:56:45,RedDeath2018,Flash???
14-02-2018T00:56:49,SpazztasticKiwi,This song reminds me of until dawn
14-02-2018T00:57:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,rtmp the little gear icon on the bottom of the stream
14-02-2018T00:57:16,Bgrmystr2,"If Flash is better than HTML5, it means you don't have hardware acceleration enabled."
14-02-2018T00:57:17,RedDeath2018,Oh
14-02-2018T00:58:07,RandomTKLover,"Im on mobile, so it automatically uses HLS"
14-02-2018T00:58:12,RedDeath2018,Same
14-02-2018T00:58:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"hardware acceleration is on for me, it just has a hugh delay for me"
14-02-2018T00:59:00,RandomTKLover,"For some reason, apple doesn‚Äôt work with RTMP, and MP4 is super buggy"
14-02-2018T00:59:09,RedDeath2018,"Hey how do you do the thing we‚Äôre the text is like full color and it‚Äôs like,‚ÄùRedDeath did something‚Äù"
14-02-2018T00:59:20,RedDeath2018,Where*

14-02-2018T00:59:37,RandomTKLover,"Do / me, but with no space or comma"
14-02-2018T00:59:38,RedDeath2018,Yes
14-02-2018T00:59:42,Bgrmystr2,"Everything has about the same for me, Marv."
14-02-2018T00:59:56,RedDeath2018,like this
14-02-2018T00:59:56,Bgrmystr2,"Flash, HLS, and MP4 are all around the same delay"
14-02-2018T01:00:03,RedDeath2018,Ha got it
14-02-2018T01:00:06,RedDeath2018,Thanks
14-02-2018T01:00:20,Bgrmystr2,but Flash is heavier on hardware across the board
14-02-2018T01:00:23,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Mp4 and HlS get up to like 15 seconds on my end while Flash around 2 of 5 seconds
14-02-2018T01:00:40,Bgrmystr2,sounds like a problem :/
14-02-2018T01:00:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,not if I use flash
14-02-2018T01:01:25,Bgrmystr2,"lol, kill your hardware doing that"
14-02-2018T01:01:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,its for a good cause
14-02-2018T01:02:09,RedDeath2018,Never abuse somthing on a computer
14-02-2018T01:02:18,ZRO4825,Abuse everything on the computer.
14-02-2018T01:02:20,ZRO4825,It likes it
14-02-2018T01:02:24,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: I guess just beware for flash-embedded malware.
14-02-2018T01:02:26,RedDeath2018,You‚Äôll pay for abusing things
14-02-2018T01:02:48,Bgrmystr2,"lol, what are you gonna do red, stop them?"
14-02-2018T01:02:57,RedDeath2018,I-T homework got me tripping

14-02-2018T01:03:20,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, sounds like you intended to. :P"
14-02-2018T01:04:13,RedDeath2018,I‚Äôm tired and still have a headache which hurts every more than before so some things may not make sense

14-02-2018T01:04:41,RedDeath2018,See I told you
14-02-2018T01:05:12,RedDeath2018,You can mess up your computer by abusing somthing too much
14-02-2018T01:05:38,RedDeath2018,Like how you can burn an image on a TV or a tablet
14-02-2018T01:05:40,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"hey now, if it can handle a stream and Jackie Chan singing, thats more then I  can ask"
14-02-2018T01:05:48,RedDeath2018,Lol
14-02-2018T01:05:49,Bgrmystr2,"You probably could, Red."
14-02-2018T01:05:58,Bgrmystr2,But plenty of us won't.
14-02-2018T01:06:47,RedDeath2018,If anything I would be abusing the power of ethical hacking when I‚Äôm older
14-02-2018T01:06:55,RedDeath2018,That‚Äôs gonna be fun

14-02-2018T01:07:53,RedDeath2018,Lol
14-02-2018T01:07:54,Dianae,Then that's damn sexy.....

14-02-2018T01:10:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Warning would be nice next time. The noise I made was not human
14-02-2018T01:10:52,unsteddyphoenix,Where's the fun in that?
14-02-2018T01:10:58,RedDeath2018,And I haven‚Äôt had a look-aid in awhile
14-02-2018T01:11:05,Behrkave,i think all he said in them was hello or hi

14-02-2018T01:14:47,RedDeath2018,Hopefully tomorrow it‚Äôs fine so I can do homework fine
14-02-2018T01:14:54,InTheLionsDen,It isn't. Just an error paste
14-02-2018T01:15:01,RedDeath2018,Yea I ate and drank lots of water
14-02-2018T01:15:17,unsteddyphoenix,...are you trying to say you accidentally did that?

14-02-2018T01:17:01,Bgrmystr2,because you're physically active

14-02-2018T01:18:02,Bgrmystr2,being more physically active = a faster metabolism.
14-02-2018T01:18:09,Bgrmystr2,and you burn calories quicker
14-02-2018T01:18:20,Bgrmystr2,so you need to eat more than someone who doesn't do as much physical activity
14-02-2018T01:18:44,ZRO4825,"I tried to be more physically active, I got tired. D:"
14-02-2018T01:18:47,RedDeath2018,I drink a lot of gateraid and I have a very fast motabolism according to the doctors

14-02-2018T01:19:24,Bgrmystr2,and that'll be why you're always hungry. You eat but you burn it off quick
14-02-2018T01:19:54,RedDeath2018,Probably gonna just stay indoors tommorow and eat and drink maybe I‚Äôll feel better
14-02-2018T01:19:54,ZRO4825,Damnit. I tried to scroll down to see the rest of the page in the stream again. :joy:

14-02-2018T01:22:56,w0lfmare,Too many questions to answer them all AND draw
14-02-2018T01:23:13,w0lfmare,The stream is here for Tom to draw afterall
14-02-2018T01:23:17,Bgrmystr2,This song is slowly becoming one of my favorites
14-02-2018T01:23:38,Combak,"Go watch a few Let's Plays or Video Game Livestreams, and you'll see how much worse people do when they're both playing and talking."
14-02-2018T01:23:42,Bgrmystr2,"The synth is outrageous, I love it"
14-02-2018T01:23:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I knew he wasn‚Äôt much of a talker - that‚Äôs shown in Mark‚Äôs livestreams at home when he walks in
14-02-2018T01:23:51,TheBeckoner,"Ive been liking a bunch of ""Snails house"" stuff"
14-02-2018T01:24:34,RedDeath2018,Wait are Mark and Tom roommates
14-02-2018T01:24:42,Bgrmystr2,no..?
14-02-2018T01:24:48,Bgrmystr2,how did you come to that conclusion
14-02-2018T01:24:49,SpazztasticKiwi,not Even remotely
14-02-2018T01:24:50,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-keifacepalm:
14-02-2018T01:24:57,ZRO4825,They are their mother's husband's son's brothers.
14-02-2018T01:25:10,RedDeath2018,I‚Äôm know they are brothers
14-02-2018T01:25:13,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-confused:
14-02-2018T01:25:37,RedDeath2018,Let‚Äôs change the subject before I sound even more stupid
14-02-2018T01:25:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I just figured there was no voice line because it‚Äôs not entirely necessary if you have a text line
14-02-2018T01:25:44,Bgrmystr2,toolate
14-02-2018T01:25:45,Bgrmystr2,XD
14-02-2018T01:26:21,RedDeath2018,great
14-02-2018T01:26:26,RedDeath2018,:
14-02-2018T01:26:49,unsteddyphoenix,On the plus side you're basically at rock bottom
14-02-2018T01:26:50,Dianae,Poor Sythe.
14-02-2018T01:26:50,RedDeath2018,then realized how much he screwed up
14-02-2018T01:26:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"Don‚Äôt worry, I though Tom was shy before"
14-02-2018T01:26:53,unsteddyphoenix,So you can only go up from here!
14-02-2018T01:27:30,SpazztasticKiwi,But evidently smartass is a genetic trait
14-02-2018T01:27:52,RedDeath2018,E=mc2 I‚Äôma genius in the chat now
14-02-2018T01:28:10,RedDeath2018,Einstein level smartness
14-02-2018T01:28:16,unsteddyphoenix,Ok I was wrong
14-02-2018T01:28:20,unsteddyphoenix,You could sound dumber
14-02-2018T01:28:23,unsteddyphoenix,It's happening
14-02-2018T01:28:25,Bgrmystr2,:face_palm: I'm just gonna not.
14-02-2018T01:28:25,RedDeath2018,Lol
14-02-2018T01:28:32,Alphawolf333,it would be E = mc^2
14-02-2018T01:28:37,Dianae,I had a friend who kept threatening to get an A+ tattooed on her rump so that she could call herself a smartass and have the proof....
14-02-2018T01:28:48,RedDeath2018,XD
14-02-2018T01:28:56,RedDeath2018,I‚Äôm delusional
14-02-2018T01:29:01,ZRO4825,But is it really a good idea to advertise the fact that your ass is the smartest part of you? :thinking:
14-02-2018T01:29:05,RedDeath2018,F**k
14-02-2018T01:29:05,Bgrmystr2,"We can see that, Red."
14-02-2018T01:29:08,Bgrmystr2,LOL Zro
14-02-2018T01:29:13,Unenlagia,The only way to show that would be to take your pants off.
14-02-2018T01:29:20,Bgrmystr2,"For most people, Zro, it probably is."
14-02-2018T01:29:26,ZRO4825,For some people that's the least of their concerns Unenlagia...
14-02-2018T01:29:54,Unenlagia,I'm more concerned about if she decides to show off her smartass in public and gets arrested
14-02-2018T01:30:15,RedDeath2018,She‚Äôll be to smart to do that
14-02-2018T01:30:25,Alphawolf333,or atleast her ass will be
14-02-2018T01:30:25,ZRO4825,"....again, for some people, that's not really a concern. At least not till after the fact (and even then sometimes...)"
14-02-2018T01:30:28,Bgrmystr2,You are the dumbest smart person I know - Detective Spooner
14-02-2018T01:30:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"Calling yourself a smartass only works if you‚Äôre smart. Otherwise, you‚Äôre just an ass"
14-02-2018T01:30:42,RedDeath2018,Lol
14-02-2018T01:30:54,unsteddyphoenix,"Lol imagined getting mooned and the ass has ""A+"" on it"
14-02-2018T01:31:00,unsteddyphoenix,Im liking this idea more and more
14-02-2018T01:31:03,Bgrmystr2,Hahahah
14-02-2018T01:31:04,RedDeath2018,Lol
14-02-2018T01:31:22,RedDeath2018,Now that was funny
14-02-2018T01:31:23,ZRO4825,"I can imagine that Unsteddy, because my next comment would probably be ""Huh, didn't think A+ meat had so much fat on it..."""
14-02-2018T01:31:35,Unenlagia,*airhorn*
14-02-2018T01:31:46,unsteddyphoenix,top grade ass
14-02-2018T01:31:48,RedDeath2018,Ohhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
14-02-2018T01:31:49,Unenlagia,OOOOOOOOOOOOOO
14-02-2018T01:31:58,TheBeckoner,I like this music.
14-02-2018T01:32:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Are y‚Äôall easily amused?
14-02-2018T01:32:24,RedDeath2018,Sound like elevator music
14-02-2018T01:32:25,TheBeckoner,No.
14-02-2018T01:32:28,unsteddyphoenix,I am yes.
14-02-2018T01:32:30,Unenlagia,Somewhat
14-02-2018T01:32:34,Alphawolf333,depends on my mood
14-02-2018T01:32:39,Dianae,depends on the distraction.
14-02-2018T01:32:41,Bgrmystr2,I believe most people here are easily amused.
14-02-2018T01:32:44,unsteddyphoenix,So those series of responses was basically
14-02-2018T01:32:45,RedDeath2018,"As long as I‚Äôm happy , yes"
14-02-2018T01:32:47,Bgrmystr2,from what I've seen
14-02-2018T01:32:51,unsteddyphoenix,"""yes, no, maybe so, I dont know"""
14-02-2018T01:32:58,Unenlagia,I also enjoy sending fictional characters into personal hells for the sake of development
14-02-2018T01:33:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"Since your responses are more jumpy than a flea on a hot pan, I‚Äôm gonna say yes"
14-02-2018T01:34:03,Dianae,"That's one of the hallmarks of some authors of long, and by long I mean epicly long stories."
14-02-2018T01:34:08,RedDeath2018,üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
14-02-2018T01:34:12,ZRO4825,Can't really foresee a flea lasting long enough on a hot pan to do much jumping. o.o;
14-02-2018T01:34:29,SpazztasticKiwi,That purple/orange gradient tho
14-02-2018T01:34:35,Alphawolf333,but oh boy would it probably be amusing
14-02-2018T01:35:07,Unenlagia,There's no drama or engagement if there isn't anything at stake
14-02-2018T01:35:16,TheBeckoner,Hey Tom. I like your grass.
14-02-2018T01:35:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"I was going to say just take away the gr, but..."
14-02-2018T01:35:59,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-NoraEyebrows:
14-02-2018T01:36:02,Unenlagia,Now who's easily amused?
14-02-2018T01:36:12,Dianae,"Grass, Sass, Smartass!"
14-02-2018T01:36:13,unsteddyphoenix,"lol, ironic"

14-02-2018T01:37:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Tf do you expect
14-02-2018T01:37:15,ZRO4825,A lack of hypocrisy? :thinking:
14-02-2018T01:37:28,Dianae,Never!
14-02-2018T01:37:44,TheBeckoner,"You're gay, Red."
14-02-2018T01:37:46,unsteddyphoenix,"to be fair, she never said it was a bad thing"
14-02-2018T01:38:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I am one of the most easily agitated and chill girl you‚Äôll ever meet
14-02-2018T01:38:25,RedDeath2018,I may be gay but I‚Äôm not the one who wanted a whole Tom
14-02-2018T01:38:26,unsteddyphoenix,shaking Karen gif next emote?
14-02-2018T01:38:36,Bgrmystr2,Jesus Karen calm down

14-02-2018T01:39:11,Unenlagia,"Don't scream, it only makes it worse"
14-02-2018T01:39:27,ZRO4825,I wouldn't mind a whole Tom. Better than getting pieces of him. That'd make making comics kinda difficult.
14-02-2018T01:39:34,Unenlagia,I'm unfortunately speaking from experience.
14-02-2018T01:39:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I like cheese
14-02-2018T01:39:44,TheBeckoner,still wants a whole Tom.
14-02-2018T01:39:46,Unenlagia,I like potatoes
14-02-2018T01:39:53,RandomTKLover,"Violets are red, Roses are blue. If you think otherwise, then fuck you."
14-02-2018T01:39:57,RedDeath2018,Earlier Tom said he exploded so then me and midnight and.... someone else were talking about him being in pieces
14-02-2018T01:40:09,Bgrmystr2,Wow random.
14-02-2018T01:40:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Ooohhh
14-02-2018T01:40:12,Bgrmystr2,just wow
14-02-2018T01:40:14,Unenlagia,Yet the hand keeps drawing
14-02-2018T01:40:24,Unenlagia,It is dedicated to the craft
14-02-2018T01:40:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Must...finish...comic
14-02-2018T01:40:44,RandomTKLover,His hand is the only thing not in pieces
14-02-2018T01:41:14,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúWhy is you vase moving across the shelf?‚Äù
14-02-2018T01:41:14,RedDeath2018,Then midnight said that she would sell his pieces on eBay or something
14-02-2018T01:41:33,RedDeath2018,Then beck said that he wanted a whole Tom
14-02-2018T01:41:38,Unenlagia,Tom is now Thing from the Addams Family
14-02-2018T01:41:40,RedDeath2018,So the more you know

14-02-2018T01:43:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"Then again, I also have the hair for it - you should see me blow dry"
14-02-2018T01:44:13,RedDeath2018,Ima have nightmares that Tom actually exploded and there will be no more Twokinds comics or streams
14-02-2018T01:44:27,Twokinds,explodes... twice!

14-02-2018T01:45:49,Unenlagia,I avoid fluffy mushrooms. Bad trips.
14-02-2018T01:45:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Dat grass...
14-02-2018T01:47:16,RedDeath2018,then finds the super glue then trows it away. Then he stitched Tom back together. He then realized that he would have to live with killing his motivatation to draw better the second time
14-02-2018T01:47:55,RedDeath2018,Well s**t

14-02-2018T02:57:43,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh true true
14-02-2018T02:58:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"Since the stream‚Äôs over, u want to hop over to discord? You can share pictures and videos there instantly"
14-02-2018T03:00:57,unsteddyphoenix,Do you have a server or whatever'?
14-02-2018T03:01:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Yep
14-02-2018T03:04:18,SpazztasticKiwi,https://discord.gg/dNAXed
14-02-2018T03:04:59,Dadrobit,Gotta get dem day later deals tho!
14-02-2018T03:05:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve had problems with links sometimes though
14-02-2018T03:05:28,unsteddyphoenix,"Maybe I should just, make a discord for people I like"
14-02-2018T03:05:37,unsteddyphoenix,So I dont have to use the huge twokinds ones :thinking:
14-02-2018T03:05:50,Dadrobit,Caaaaaanceeeerrrrrrrr
14-02-2018T03:06:29,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah...not a big fan of the huge crowds.
14-02-2018T03:06:39,Dadrobit,"Honestly, sooooo much drama between all of them, it's actually not fun to even have Discord open."
14-02-2018T03:06:49,SpazztasticKiwi,The server‚Äôs called Chatterbox
14-02-2018T03:07:15,unsteddyphoenix,Haha
14-02-2018T03:09:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Though you can evidently add people as friends if you know their name without invites to servers
14-02-2018T03:09:30,unsteddyphoenix,Oh true
14-02-2018T03:09:34,SpazztasticKiwi,This app is weird
14-02-2018T03:09:53,unsteddyphoenix,Add me as friend~
14-02-2018T03:09:56,unsteddyphoenix,unsteddy#2879
14-02-2018T03:09:57,unsteddyphoenix,I think
14-02-2018T03:10:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Found you - sent
14-02-2018T03:11:11,unsteddyphoenix,But yeah. Guess i'd rather stay here than chat with peeps I dont really know
14-02-2018T03:11:31,unsteddyphoenix,For now at least
14-02-2018T03:12:19,SpazztasticKiwi,SpazztasticKiwi#6072
14-02-2018T03:13:24,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs no one else on mine. It‚Äôs why I made it - a simple group of people who be collectively agreed to gather to chat also silently agree not to be spammers
14-02-2018T03:13:37,unsteddyphoenix,oh ok
14-02-2018T03:14:04,Bgrmystr2,"Congrats Kiwi, you literally did the same thing as everyone else"
14-02-2018T03:14:05,Bgrmystr2,xDD
14-02-2018T03:14:34,unsteddyphoenix,"Basically what I meant to do, but you did it first"
14-02-2018T03:14:53,SpazztasticKiwi,It worked didn‚Äôt it.
14-02-2018T03:15:15,unsteddyphoenix,Well played~
14-02-2018T03:15:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Though it‚Äôs not as effective as my Twitter. I im more with online friends there
14-02-2018T03:16:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"Honestly I don‚Äôt know why I have my discord; probably just morbid curiosity for Mark‚Äôs server, which never gets me anywhere"
14-02-2018T03:17:57,SpazztasticKiwi,It is interesting to watch others‚Äô behavior on it though; my interest in people watching
14-02-2018T03:18:09,Dadrobit,A zoo. You made a zoo.
14-02-2018T03:19:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Exactly! That‚Äôs it - I‚Äôm watching people in their natural habitat
14-02-2018T03:19:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Kind of
14-02-2018T03:20:08,unsteddyphoenix,I get that.
14-02-2018T03:20:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Psychology and human nature fascinate me
14-02-2018T03:20:25,Dadrobit,"See, that's the thing about zoos as well, they're not truly ""natureal"" habitats, someone just putthm in a place they think the animals will like!"
14-02-2018T03:20:33,Dadrobit,"""natural""*"
14-02-2018T03:20:39,Dadrobit,put them*
14-02-2018T03:20:51,Dadrobit,Spelling is shitting the bed here...
14-02-2018T03:21:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Isn‚Äôt that what this discord is? (I think we‚Äôve cracked the code)
14-02-2018T03:22:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"Btw, I‚Äôve been sneezing all day - could I be allergic to Valentine‚Äôs Day?"
14-02-2018T03:23:37,Dadrobit,"I'm not a doctor, but I can act like one. So yes, definitely. You are terminally allergic to V-Day."
14-02-2018T03:24:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"Darn. Now I can never find love, for it will feel as if I have the flu *faints dramatically*"
14-02-2018T03:24:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Sometimes I wonder if I sound eccentric or crazy to people
14-02-2018T03:25:15,unsteddyphoenix,Love is in the air
14-02-2018T03:25:21,unsteddyphoenix,And youre deathly allergic
14-02-2018T03:25:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I have my can of air freshener ready
14-02-2018T03:28:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Valentines does make me feel joy that some of the people I love have found their own love
14-02-2018T03:29:28,Bgrmystr2,"That's the problem with human zoos though. Someone gathers others and observes them, but does not truly understand those people's nature"
14-02-2018T03:29:42,Bgrmystr2,"You need to go to the people, you don't bring the people to you."
14-02-2018T03:30:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I people watch all the time at work. That an example?
14-02-2018T03:30:32,Bgrmystr2,"when you go to them, they're comfortable in their own environment. Much easier to see"
14-02-2018T03:30:35,unsteddyphoenix,Because youre bored and have nothing else to do?
14-02-2018T03:30:40,Bgrmystr2,xD
14-02-2018T03:31:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"Sometimes. I once saw a family come in - about five kids and a couple - and about five minutes in, two of the children were running around with plastic bags over their heads"
14-02-2018T03:31:59,SpazztasticKiwi,The parents never commented or looked up
14-02-2018T03:32:17,unsteddyphoenix,LOL
14-02-2018T03:32:21,Dadrobit,"Bah, I did that as a kid and turned out fine!"
14-02-2018T03:32:32,Dadrobit,More or less.
14-02-2018T03:32:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I was worried and entertained at the same time
14-02-2018T03:33:30,unsteddyphoenix,Something something natural selectiojn
14-02-2018T03:34:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Human sympathy interferes with natural selection  - it‚Äôs why there are still people that make you want to facepalm
14-02-2018T03:35:12,unsteddyphoenix,That dang empathy
14-02-2018T03:35:17,unsteddyphoenix,Always GETTING IN MY WAY
14-02-2018T03:35:58,Bgrmystr2,Hope is the reason why the stupid people haven't died off yet. We hope these people can be reasoned with. Hope they can get smarter. Hope they can become not-stupid if they're helped.
14-02-2018T03:36:01,Bgrmystr2,:/
14-02-2018T03:36:13,SpazztasticKiwi,This is also true

14-02-2018T03:39:05,Dadrobit,Lucky for you that Serp isn't around much anymore.
14-02-2018T03:39:37,Dadrobit,I think Sage banning him for being annoying kinda got to him tbh.
14-02-2018T03:39:53,Dadrobit,Barely seen him like twice since then.
14-02-2018T03:40:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"Are there really ‚Äú18 users‚Äù, or just three users and 15 lurkers?"
14-02-2018T03:40:43,Dadrobit,Yes

14-02-2018T03:48:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Except Tom. Can‚Äôt remember a typo from him right off
14-02-2018T03:48:39,Bgrmystr2,"Hey, I speak and spell English quite well, thanks."
14-02-2018T03:48:42,Bgrmystr2,Speak for yourself.
14-02-2018T03:48:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I shall
14-02-2018T03:49:03,Bgrmystr2,"Also, tom makes lots of typos"
14-02-2018T03:49:03,Dadrobit,Tom? Not having spelling errors? AHAHAHAHAHAHHHAHAHAHAHAHAH
14-02-2018T03:49:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"Either I read typos and my brain autocorrects (unless it‚Äôs really bad) for me, or I haven‚Äôt seen one yet"
14-02-2018T03:50:13,Dadrobit,They ususally eventually get fixed.
14-02-2018T03:50:19,Dadrobit,usually*
14-02-2018T03:50:29,Bgrmystr2,"All I'm gonna say is ""passed"""
14-02-2018T03:50:34,Bgrmystr2,and leave it at that.

14-02-2018T03:50:37,Bgrmystr2,xD
14-02-2018T03:51:21,Bgrmystr2,too many people in the chat that didn't know the diff between present and past tense.

14-02-2018T03:52:12,Bgrmystr2,that day hurt my brain
14-02-2018T03:52:25,Bgrmystr2,"Also, phoenix's name"
14-02-2018T03:52:39,Bgrmystr2,his fucking name :ptv-laugh:
14-02-2018T03:53:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I have wondered about that. If it was deliberate or not
14-02-2018T03:53:37,Bgrmystr2,I think the first time was accidental
14-02-2018T03:53:49,Bgrmystr2,and after that it was deliberate
14-02-2018T03:53:57,Bgrmystr2,and now it's a running joke.
14-02-2018T03:54:32,Bgrmystr2,Phoenix is the only one Tom always fucks with the name lol
14-02-2018T03:54:47,Bgrmystr2,it's interesting how many he's come up with
14-02-2018T03:55:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve paid attention
14-02-2018T03:55:21,Bgrmystr2,my favorite is still the Kat daki
14-02-2018T03:55:31,Bgrmystr2,"suggested by ""Unsteadddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd"""
14-02-2018T03:55:39,Bgrmystr2,and it goes off the page
14-02-2018T03:55:46,Bgrmystr2,I bout died seeing that xD
14-02-2018T03:55:51,Dadrobit,unsteddy unicycle
14-02-2018T03:55:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"I have seen a few jabs, but I‚Äôm also more used to a different kind of teasing"
14-02-2018T03:56:00,Bgrmystr2,hahahaha that was good too dadro
14-02-2018T03:57:13,unsteddyphoenix,Oh yeah
14-02-2018T03:57:23,unsteddyphoenix,Speaking of still willing to do the proofing tom if you want
14-02-2018T03:57:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom‚Äôs personality is taking quite the shape for me. Makes me curious as to how he‚Äôd be in person
14-02-2018T03:58:36,Dadrobit,"That's the thing though. You say that, but in reality you only know how he portrays on stream in tiny 3 hour bites thrice a week."
14-02-2018T03:58:44,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I‚Äôm spending more time over here than on YouTube
14-02-2018T03:58:46,Bgrmystr2,probably quiet and reserved. On the inside he's bouncing.
14-02-2018T03:58:52,Bgrmystr2,always bouncing
14-02-2018T03:58:56,Dadrobit,"That's the scary part of the internet, no one really knows anyone else."
14-02-2018T03:59:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"Even on days without a stream, and before/after streams"
14-02-2018T04:00:22,Dadrobit,portrays himself*
14-02-2018T04:00:34,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs also too many people who say they like someone they watch so much they‚Äôd marry them on the spot
14-02-2018T04:00:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm wary of those people
14-02-2018T04:03:19,Twokinds,ok
14-02-2018T04:03:48,Dadrobit,Proofing the next book?
14-02-2018T04:04:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok what? ü§®
14-02-2018T04:05:19,Twokinds,"If you'd like to proof it, phoenix, I'll send it to you."
14-02-2018T04:05:42,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah sure. :)
14-02-2018T04:06:17,unsteddyphoenix,Always be people of people who are into marriarge
14-02-2018T04:06:22,unsteddyphoenix,Wary
14-02-2018T04:06:27,unsteddyphoenix,What are they hiding...
14-02-2018T04:07:04,Dadrobit,What are they after...
14-02-2018T04:07:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"Trust me, my dad taught me that one"
14-02-2018T04:09:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Did y‚Äôall know there‚Äôs a such thing as a cross between a leopard and a lion?
14-02-2018T04:09:36,Dadrobit,"Got the books when you released the three volume + poster bundle, dunno when I'll get book 4."
14-02-2018T04:10:20,Dadrobit,"3 volume, art book, + poster I mean."
14-02-2018T04:10:35,unsteddyphoenix,Pesky reality put a damper on me acquiring the books
14-02-2018T04:11:00,unsteddyphoenix,Shipping more than the product itself :/
14-02-2018T04:11:06,Twokinds,I'll give you free copy for proofing
14-02-2018T04:11:10,unsteddyphoenix,Thats why the internet is best
14-02-2018T04:11:32,unsteddyphoenix,Oh! Thankyou! :D
14-02-2018T04:11:34,Dadrobit,"Yupper. Spent a lot on classes this semester, and not having a stable income like security makes splurging on stuff not ideal lol."
14-02-2018T04:11:40,Bgrmystr2,Debating on taking a look myself honestly. :thinking:
14-02-2018T04:11:59,Dadrobit,"Ayyyy, getting in good"
14-02-2018T04:12:55,unsteddyphoenix,I feel that dad.
14-02-2018T04:13:17,unsteddyphoenix,"Hoping to get an adult job this year, then I can feel a bit more secure~"
14-02-2018T04:13:42,Twokinds,I send email
14-02-2018T04:14:08,SpazztasticKiwi,What kind of job you thinking about?
14-02-2018T04:14:17,Dadrobit,"VO is fun, but goddamned scary at times."
14-02-2018T04:14:42,unsteddyphoenix,"Got it, next week should be fine. :thumbsup:"
14-02-2018T04:14:52,unsteddyphoenix,If I had your voice I would totally be pursuing that too~
14-02-2018T04:15:00,Twokinds,I'm sleep now.
14-02-2018T04:15:03,Dadrobit,I'll go from getting gigs left and right to not having a single audition response for three weeks.
14-02-2018T04:15:13,Bgrmystr2,Gnight Tom :O
14-02-2018T04:15:14,unsteddyphoenix,You sleep good.

14-02-2018T04:15:58,MviluUatusun,"Darn it.  I must have just missed the stream.  Oh, well, SOML."
14-02-2018T04:15:58,SpazztasticKiwi,That sounds good
14-02-2018T04:15:59,Dadrobit,Fitting that you're doing this for Tom hten lol
14-02-2018T04:16:15,Dadrobit,missed it by 2 hours
14-02-2018T04:16:17,unsteddyphoenix,Right? It just made sense
14-02-2018T04:16:19,Dadrobit,then*
14-02-2018T04:16:49,MviluUatusun,"Oh.  I guess that's better than less than 5 minutes, Dad."
14-02-2018T04:16:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I realized ten minutes ago that is was 3
14-02-2018T04:17:18,Dadrobit,c'est la vie
14-02-2018T04:17:37,MviluUatusun,"That's my motto, Dad.  Well, one of them anyway."

14-02-2018T04:18:48,Dadrobit,"Unsteddy, lookin' like a young boi"
14-02-2018T04:18:55,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno if I'd want to get into editing and stuff. It's not like I'm bad at it, and I have a good grasp of English, it's just.. I dunno. I've never actually enjoyed writing stuff. It always ends badly."
14-02-2018T04:18:59,unsteddyphoenix,graduated uni at the end of last years
14-02-2018T04:19:02,Bgrmystr2,so gl to you phoenix
14-02-2018T04:19:07,MviluUatusun,"Oh, while I'm thinking about it, I'm a patron of Eric W. Schwartz.  Recently, he asked his patrons for ideas for Valentine's drawings.  I offered him my Amanda Fuchs and her boyfriend, Michael in a lover's embrace and he drew it."
14-02-2018T04:19:20,unsteddyphoenix,"I like writing, I just am bad at self-motivation"
14-02-2018T04:19:31,unsteddyphoenix,Very bad
14-02-2018T04:19:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"Like people like to say to me, you‚Äôll appreciate being estimated younger than you are when you‚Äôre old"
14-02-2018T04:19:40,Bgrmystr2,"lol phoenix, wanna trade?"
14-02-2018T04:19:42,Bgrmystr2,XD
14-02-2018T04:19:50,unsteddyphoenix,I think that applies to women more than men
14-02-2018T04:19:51,MviluUatusun,I'm great at self-motivation.  I'm bad about stopping doing something else I enjoy to write.
14-02-2018T04:20:12,Dadrobit,My age depends on my beard.
14-02-2018T04:20:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I dunno. I‚Äôve met some guys that look 20 who are 16
14-02-2018T04:20:14,unsteddyphoenix,Swapping one bad situation for another

14-02-2018T04:21:04,unsteddyphoenix,They dont ask you with a beard?
14-02-2018T04:21:09,Dadrobit,"Full beard? ""Would you like to participate in this survey of men over 35?"""
14-02-2018T04:21:17,Bgrmystr2,My mother actually got carded at a pizza place nearby within the past year.
14-02-2018T04:21:18,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha
14-02-2018T04:21:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Sometimes a beard is the difference between a man and a teenager
14-02-2018T04:21:27,Bgrmystr2,They legitimately asked for her ID
14-02-2018T04:21:34,unsteddyphoenix,Thats true
14-02-2018T04:21:54,unsteddyphoenix,"My facial hair grows fast but is bad so, doesnt help me~"
14-02-2018T04:21:56,Dadrobit,"Unless it's a teenager's beard, then they're definitely still a teenager."
14-02-2018T04:22:02,Bgrmystr2,Not sure if mom looks impossibly young for her age.. or girl just can't tell ages.
14-02-2018T04:22:19,unsteddyphoenix,The old 8-hairs-teen-moustache
14-02-2018T04:22:32,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs some guys I graduated with who I swear had growth hormones in their face
14-02-2018T04:22:33,Dadrobit,"Could be a ""no exceptions"" carding policy"
14-02-2018T04:22:37,MviluUatusun,"Bgr, it could also be that store's policy to card EVERYBODY."
14-02-2018T04:22:44,Bgrmystr2,naw
14-02-2018T04:22:53,Bgrmystr2,they don't need to card people if it's obvious they're old
14-02-2018T04:23:03,Bgrmystr2,it's not a mandatory thing
14-02-2018T04:23:04,unsteddyphoenix,Nah they might be right bgr
14-02-2018T04:23:10,unsteddyphoenix,there are places that do that
14-02-2018T04:23:11,MviluUatusun,"Here in Georgia, even if you're gray haired and wrinkled like a prune, you get carded when you buy cigarettes."
14-02-2018T04:23:24,MviluUatusun,It's the law.
14-02-2018T04:23:26,Dadrobit,"Yup, my store had mandatory carding."
14-02-2018T04:23:46,unsteddyphoenix,"Sick of the ""but she LOOKED 21"" excuse while theyre getting sued"
14-02-2018T04:23:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve never been carded for anything
14-02-2018T04:24:07,Bgrmystr2,I'm fairly sure I would know considering they asked about it xD
14-02-2018T04:24:12,Bgrmystr2,and they told me
14-02-2018T04:24:21,unsteddyphoenix,"You work at the walmart, who's gonna card you for buying liquor?"
14-02-2018T04:24:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt drink
14-02-2018T04:24:47,Bgrmystr2,"It wasn't for alchohol, it was just for credit card payment"
14-02-2018T04:24:52,MviluUatusun,"I don't think Wal-Mart sells liquor.  They do sell beer and wine, though."
14-02-2018T04:25:05,Dadrobit,"Oh, then of course they're going to card."
14-02-2018T04:25:13,MviluUatusun,Oooooh.  Now THAT'S unusual.
14-02-2018T04:25:20,Dadrobit,It is?
14-02-2018T04:25:26,Bgrmystr2,Not here they don't.
14-02-2018T04:25:38,SpazztasticKiwi,We card for tide products now in some places
14-02-2018T04:25:40,MviluUatusun,I've never been carded for using my card to pay for something.
14-02-2018T04:25:42,Dadrobit,ID checking credit cards is SOP in a LOT of places.
14-02-2018T04:25:56,unsteddyphoenix,LOL really?
14-02-2018T04:26:15,unsteddyphoenix,Noones even eating them accidentally!
14-02-2018T04:26:18,MviluUatusun,"True, even in places where debit cards are run like credit cards."
14-02-2018T04:26:21,Bgrmystr2,"It's not mandatory at the pizza place they went to, it was simply the waitress girl couldn't tell my mother's age. xD"
14-02-2018T04:26:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Yes. And some stores are having to lock up tide products
14-02-2018T04:26:35,unsteddyphoenix,Aaaa murica PLEASE.
14-02-2018T04:26:47,MviluUatusun,"I've had that problem a few times, Bgr, even when I was in my 40s."
14-02-2018T04:26:58,Dadrobit,"Speaking of 'Murica, I never did get that burrito..."
14-02-2018T04:27:14,Bgrmystr2,"My mother's in her early 50s, Mvilu"

14-02-2018T04:28:04,MviluUatusun,"Well, when I was in my 50s, some people actually told me they thought I was in my 20s.  BOY!  Things sure have changed in the last 10 years or so.  LOL."
14-02-2018T04:28:40,MviluUatusun,"Now, Bgr, it would be bad if they carded your mother and let you go."
14-02-2018T04:28:52,MviluUatusun,THAT would be insulting.  LOL.
14-02-2018T04:28:57,Bgrmystr2,lool
14-02-2018T04:29:03,Bgrmystr2,probably xD
14-02-2018T04:29:32,MviluUatusun,"Well, I've got to go do something else before I leave for work.  I'll see y'all next time Tom streams, if not somewhere else."
14-02-2018T04:29:33,Bgrmystr2,"fairly sure they wouldn't card me, since I'm getting to have a werewolf beard atm"
14-02-2018T04:29:48,Bgrmystr2,seeya Mvilu :)

14-02-2018T04:36:15,Bgrmystr2,so the 28th would make sense
14-02-2018T04:36:16,Dadrobit,"The ""with a voice like yours"" one."
14-02-2018T04:36:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Aw look it‚Äôs two grown men being cute
14-02-2018T04:36:28,Bgrmystr2,cuz I recall him being on the opposite end of the month as my bday
14-02-2018T04:36:47,Dadrobit,"28th, I remember because it's almost a week after my own."
14-02-2018T04:36:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Isn‚Äôt it posted on his profile on the website?
14-02-2018T04:37:28,Dadrobit,Lemme check
14-02-2018T04:37:36,iliar,"Born: July 28, 1987 http://twokinds.keenspot.com/about/"
14-02-2018T04:37:44,Dadrobit,yes
14-02-2018T04:37:59,Bgrmystr2,he's slightly less than a year older than me
14-02-2018T04:38:06,SpazztasticKiwi,It is and it says he‚Äôs still 29
14-02-2018T04:38:33,Dadrobit,And has a pic of him when he was 20
14-02-2018T04:38:45,Bgrmystr2,He should be 30 though. He'll be 31 this year
14-02-2018T04:39:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Wonder if he celebrates it
14-02-2018T04:44:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"Anyway, imma go to bed. I‚Äôll probably pop back in tomorrow and say hi"
14-02-2018T04:44:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"G‚Äônight everyone, g‚Äônight Tom"

14-02-2018T13:04:48,SpazztasticKiwi,And I think I know a better reason why I sneezed all day yesterday - we sell rediculous amounts of cut flowers and plants on Valentines
14-02-2018T13:06:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôm still sneezing now, and it makes that theory more likely because all the ladies were given one of the flowers to take home"

14-02-2018T13:58:47,TheBeckoner,Sounds good.

14-02-2018T14:05:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Because you must be able to touch the precious
14-02-2018T14:13:52,TheBeckoner,I believe he was referring to the comic FoMo. PLus the book has other stuff in it from what I gather and the comic gets switched up a bit for flow.
14-02-2018T14:18:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôd get a poster but Bagheera likes to paw at them
14-02-2018T14:20:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"Pins would be great, but they take ridiculous amounts of planning"
14-02-2018T14:20:37,TheBeckoner,Pins?
14-02-2018T14:21:25,SpazztasticKiwi,They‚Äôre like broaches

14-02-2018T16:27:30,Twokinds,I fixed it finally. Had to reinstall it fully.
14-02-2018T16:27:43,RedDeath2018,Oh ok

14-02-2018T16:28:06,RedDeath2018,But why did you need a remote
14-02-2018T16:28:53,RedDeath2018,I thought it was like a touchscreen monitor
14-02-2018T16:31:28,Twokinds,It's not a touch screen.
14-02-2018T16:31:52,RedDeath2018,I‚Äôm so confused right now
14-02-2018T16:32:05,RedDeath2018,Is it a drawing tablet then

14-02-2018T18:12:49,RedDeath2018,I‚Äôve never had a drawing tablet or used one
14-02-2018T18:13:14,RedDeath2018,And none of my friends are too big with drawing
14-02-2018T18:13:30,RedDeath2018,Never even used a drawing tablet
14-02-2018T18:13:41,RedDeath2018,That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking you guys
14-02-2018T18:14:58,JaydenMozingo,"Krita software isn't 'that' bad, but there could be better"
14-02-2018T18:15:04,JaydenMozingo,Gimp sucks btw

14-02-2018T18:15:41,RedDeath2018,I found this huion 1060 plus with a 8192 pen pressure and 12 express keys with a built in 8 GB micro SD  card
14-02-2018T18:15:58,RedDeath2018,I have a Lenovo
14-02-2018T18:16:03,JaydenMozingo,woah. fancy
14-02-2018T18:16:35,JaydenMozingo,because you might want to check your computer to see if it has the tablet requirments
14-02-2018T18:16:35,RedDeath2018,And the tablet is 82.99 so that‚Äôs always good
14-02-2018T18:17:21,RedDeath2018,IT says that it works with almost every computer
14-02-2018T18:17:49,JaydenMozingo,Well I have an Asus laptop
14-02-2018T18:18:07,JaydenMozingo,it works with that
14-02-2018T18:18:28,RedDeath2018,Alright
14-02-2018T18:18:33,JaydenMozingo,"Wacom is a bit more, strict, with what they need for your computer"
14-02-2018T18:18:52,RedDeath2018,Well now I know what to avoid
14-02-2018T18:20:12,JaydenMozingo,"Wacom isn't bad, they just require a bit more. look what Tom uses. a Wacom Cintiq 24HD. he has a compatible computer"
14-02-2018T18:20:44,RedDeath2018,Ok I‚Äôm on The Krita website and looking pretty good so far
14-02-2018T18:21:05,JaydenMozingo,"But for starting off, pro or not, the 1910B is a great choice"
14-02-2018T18:21:22,RedDeath2018,Alright thanks
14-02-2018T18:21:32,RedDeath2018,I‚Äôll keep doing my research
14-02-2018T18:21:51,RedDeath2018,This is gonna be a better birthday than last years
14-02-2018T18:23:12,RedDeath2018,Last year we went to Dollywood and that totally bombed
14-02-2018T18:23:57,JaydenMozingo,"The problem I have with Krita is that it can't make very, precise, lines, like Photoshop can"
14-02-2018T18:24:03,JaydenMozingo,But still good
14-02-2018T18:24:47,JaydenMozingo,"Got good tools, colors, mixing tools, bluring tools, point pens, etc."
14-02-2018T18:24:58,RedDeath2018,Only thing I have right now is Microsoft paint and that suck
14-02-2018T18:25:03,RedDeath2018,Sucks*
14-02-2018T18:25:33,JaydenMozingo,Krita is 100% free.
14-02-2018T18:25:35,RedDeath2018,Krita sounds really good
14-02-2018T18:25:41,RedDeath2018,And it‚Äôs free
14-02-2018T18:25:46,RedDeath2018,Yes please
14-02-2018T18:25:50,JaydenMozingo,I have Windows so... yeah
14-02-2018T18:26:12,JaydenMozingo,"It works for Mac too, but a bit different in setup installer"
14-02-2018T18:26:53,RedDeath2018,Alright
14-02-2018T18:27:14,RedDeath2018,Oooo it suports Linux
14-02-2018T18:27:18,RedDeath2018,That‚Äôs awesome

14-02-2018T18:45:01,pretorian,no prob
14-02-2018T18:45:04,Bgrmystr2,since Jay is incapable of knowing how links work

14-02-2018T18:45:42,pretorian,I got curious myself so I went and searched for it
14-02-2018T18:45:46,JaydenMozingo,I know how it works but I'm not on my phone right now.
14-02-2018T18:48:27,Bgrmystr2,then how are you talking to us? Telepathy?

14-02-2018T18:55:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"Green bean casserole, cakes, pies, cookies, cheesecake, chicken & dumplings..."
14-02-2018T18:56:22,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-confused: 5/7 Kiwi

14-02-2018T18:56:40,Bgrmystr2,"Cakes, One type of pie, cookies, cheesecake, and some chicken."
14-02-2018T18:56:49,Bgrmystr2,rest can go away
14-02-2018T18:57:00,Bgrmystr2,"pecan pie is the only type of pie I eat, other than cheesecake"
14-02-2018T18:57:03,Bgrmystr2,which is technically a pie
14-02-2018T18:57:06,Bgrmystr2,not a cake.
14-02-2018T18:57:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Also - mashed potatoes (home style)

14-02-2018T19:10:41,Bgrmystr2,"not professionally, ofc, but enough to keep me fed"

14-02-2018T19:14:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I used to cook cakes and stuff every night - my mom and sister avoided the kitchen when they heard me in ther
14-02-2018T19:15:25,TheBeckoner,Why? You mean or somethin?
14-02-2018T19:16:08,SpazztasticKiwi,No - anyone walking into the kitchen while making something can and will be subject to being confronted with a spoon and ‚Äútaste this‚Äù

14-02-2018T20:16:27,TheBeckoner,Eh nothing really changes. Essentially the same car.
14-02-2018T20:16:41,TheBeckoner,For production models that is.

14-02-2018T21:42:15,TheBeckoner,You are Tom?
14-02-2018T21:42:24,TheBeckoner,Or you are currently existing?
14-02-2018T21:42:29,TheBeckoner,Either is good.

14-02-2018T21:46:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm not sure if he was answering my question from earlier about thinking good thoughts or commenting that he‚Äôs underage
14-02-2018T21:47:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Pretty sure he‚Äôs answering my question though - makes the most sense
14-02-2018T21:54:38,MidnightBlue78,he answered yes to BluePhantom's question about how old he is
14-02-2018T21:59:57,Bgrmystr2,uhh.. midnight

14-02-2018T22:13:18,TheBeckoner,Lol I like this page
14-02-2018T22:13:29,TheBeckoner,Some sort of shapeshifting if I had a guess.
14-02-2018T22:14:03,Bgrmystr2,obv
14-02-2018T22:14:20,Dadrobit,Keiren has no idea of the booping that's coming to him.
14-02-2018T22:14:34,JaydenMozingo,Probably shapeshifting yeah
14-02-2018T22:15:55,Dadrobit,"Hmmm, so if she's (distantly) related to the Human monarchy, then I suppose she has a rather vested interest in the conflict with the assassination of the current king no?"

14-02-2018T22:18:48,Dadrobit,"I'd certainly like to see something like that; the assassination of the king was just kind of brushed over really, it'd be nice to see plot development there."
14-02-2018T22:19:24,Twokinds,"Yeah, probably. Though, due to the supreme age gap, her grandmother would be the former king's great, great, great, great, great etc relative."
14-02-2018T22:20:02,Twokinds,"If there related at all anymore, considering how lines of succession can break over time."
14-02-2018T22:21:02,Dadrobit,"Indeed, was wondering if there was any blood left there at all."
14-02-2018T22:22:43,unsteddyphoenix,Yesss I love this dragon lore
14-02-2018T22:23:00,unsteddyphoenix,"I KNEW they could reproduce with humans, it makes sense."
14-02-2018T22:24:32,unsteddyphoenix,Also lol I love how probing trace is
14-02-2018T22:24:35,unsteddyphoenix,Speaking for the fan...
14-02-2018T22:24:47,JaydenMozingo,"So now that we know dragons and humans can breed, as well (as seen so far with Flora) as keidran, what about basitins and 'other specified races'?"
14-02-2018T22:25:56,TheBeckoner,Isn't Trace an exception to reproducing with keidran?
14-02-2018T22:26:03,Dadrobit,"I think ""they don't care what the masks have to say about it"" pretty much covers the races alltogether."
14-02-2018T22:26:34,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, it implies that the other races DO care"
14-02-2018T22:26:36,Dadrobit,"Though, her specifying ""they"" instead of ""we"" is kind of sad."
14-02-2018T22:26:59,unsteddyphoenix,"Lol, naw. She's got human citizenship"

14-02-2018T22:46:55,Dadrobit,"Yeah, he taught me to use most of his tools when I was growing up. Gonna help him put his shop together fabricating some parts to make it better in a couple weeks when the shell is put up."

14-02-2018T22:52:26,Dadrobit,"Actually no, I don't respond to that in general, it's just weird."
