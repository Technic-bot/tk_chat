09-03-2018T00:11:14,unsteddyphoenix,The logic is there
09-03-2018T00:11:26,GameForge,what has this become
09-03-2018T00:11:28,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Or she's far sighted, and the glasses are for looking at things that are closer"
09-03-2018T00:11:50,Vatruvius,The epic side comic of Keith trying to hiding his using of painkillers from Natani or he would never hear the end of it.

09-03-2018T00:29:54,Combak,"So, wait... What if you swat the edge or something?"
09-03-2018T00:29:56,ButterPuppet,i think the portal edge is clear but soild

09-03-2018T00:30:12,GameForge,it has no relative thickness

09-03-2018T00:30:28,ButterPuppet,and if it closes on you you get cut in half
09-03-2018T00:30:35,Bgrmystr2,it's probably not sharp at all
09-03-2018T00:30:48,Combak,Looks pretty sharp to me!

09-03-2018T00:50:56,Bgrmystr2,I think Picarto needs to fix the multistream tab thing
09-03-2018T00:51:06,Combak,What do you mean?
09-03-2018T00:51:07,Bgrmystr2,cuz they still haven't put it back yet
09-03-2018T00:51:28,Combak,No idea what you're talking about.
09-03-2018T00:51:40,Bgrmystr2,"If you're talkin to me combak, Before picarto updated the chat, Sage's multistream section was under ALL streamers."
09-03-2018T00:51:46,Bgrmystr2,and it had the rules listed there
09-03-2018T00:51:54,Bgrmystr2,cuz sage was the host
09-03-2018T00:52:04,Combak,"... Oh, I just realized: What do you guys think of odds of Rose recognizing Raine are?"
09-03-2018T00:52:09,Bgrmystr2,and the host's multistream section was what was put under everyone during the multistream
09-03-2018T00:52:12,SageSaga,yeah they have a special area for multistream text so when you multi you have a single area set for rules and links
09-03-2018T00:52:13,Ordithus,"Yeah, that would be good.  Though it's not like people would read the rules anyways"
09-03-2018T00:52:14,Bgrmystr2,but picarto did not implement that yet

09-03-2018T01:27:33,ZRO4825,"Sage, random question, because I'm pretty sure you've answered it before and I've forgotten. How many more years (IRL) of Yosh you got left to go? o.O"
09-03-2018T01:27:40,Vatruvius,now*
09-03-2018T01:27:49,SageSaga,i dunno - maybe 5?

09-03-2018T01:28:27,SageSaga,i'll probably reduce it so i can do Yosh! 2.0
09-03-2018T01:28:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"Someone fell off stage, and another fainted"
09-03-2018T01:28:40,Vatruvius,I find if amazing that this comic is 14 years old and we progressed in the story a few months.
09-03-2018T01:28:52,neropan,woo
09-03-2018T01:28:56,Bgrmystr2,what.. are you even talkin about kiwi xD

09-03-2018T01:29:37,Vatruvius,Hmm...even more reason to believe you and Tom are clones of the same AI
09-03-2018T01:29:47,neropan,14 years..of comics... *cold sweat*
09-03-2018T01:29:55,Bgrmystr2,So much happened..
09-03-2018T01:30:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"better get started Nero, they have quit the lead"

09-03-2018T01:30:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Explains his limited speech vocabulary and impeccable drawing
09-03-2018T01:30:25,Bgrmystr2,yeah they sure do
09-03-2018T01:30:34,Vatruvius,"Well, at this rate, Tom and Sage could be like Stan Lee and have movies made of their comics and they will be put into the movie for some small joke."
09-03-2018T01:30:52,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: mmm prolly not
09-03-2018T01:30:59,SageSaga,i remember a long long time ago when some random guy sent me a message and wanted to do a link trade with me- and he had these creepy catgirls with no feet-
09-03-2018T01:31:09,Vatruvius,DON'T RUIN MY DREAM @Bgrmystr2
09-03-2018T01:31:12,SageSaga,and his name was Nekonny
09-03-2018T01:31:16,Bgrmystr2,XD sage
09-03-2018T01:31:23,Dadrobit,nice
09-03-2018T01:31:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom doesn‚Äôt strike me as someone for camera exposure
09-03-2018T01:31:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Ron's is stage name
09-03-2018T01:31:34,Bgrmystr2,"Sorry Vatru, you must not know me"
09-03-2018T01:31:37,SpazztasticKiwi,NOT THAT HES UGLY
09-03-2018T01:31:37,Bgrmystr2,It's what I do
09-03-2018T01:31:40,Dadrobit,definitely not
09-03-2018T01:31:53,SpazztasticKiwi,just that he‚Äôs quiet and reclusive
09-03-2018T01:31:53,neropan,link trade ?
09-03-2018T01:32:01,Vatruvius,:sob:
09-03-2018T01:32:07,Dadrobit,"Yeah, you need a link cable"
09-03-2018T01:32:21,Dadrobit,Or use the IR sensors on the top if you both have them
09-03-2018T01:32:24,Bgrmystr2,xDD Dadro
09-03-2018T01:32:28,neropan,:ptv-confused:
09-03-2018T01:32:32,SageSaga,yes Nero - you see back in the days of yor - we internet people would trade links on our sites so people could visit them
09-03-2018T01:32:34,ZoopBoopLoop,Wow! It actually worked!
09-03-2018T01:32:49,ZoopBoopLoop,I expected for it to backfire in a way to resplit up the party immediately
09-03-2018T01:32:54,Bgrmystr2,what worked Zoop
09-03-2018T01:33:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,No people post on Instagram
09-03-2018T01:33:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,now
09-03-2018T01:33:16,neropan,oh thats what it is
09-03-2018T01:33:18,SageSaga,"this was similar but not quite what was also referred to as a ""Web Ring"""
09-03-2018T01:33:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Wasn‚Äôt until I hit enter that I realized the possible double implication
09-03-2018T01:33:24,Bgrmystr2,"Zoop, I think your thing broke cuz you're here, not in your party :P"
09-03-2018T01:33:30,Bgrmystr2,definitely didn't work
09-03-2018T01:33:41,Ordithus,"nero, the things all over this page http://twokinds.keenspot.com/links/"
09-03-2018T01:33:56,SageSaga,sometimes you would click on a link and you would get disconnected and then you had to yell at your sister for picking up the phone
09-03-2018T01:34:13,neropan,ooo
09-03-2018T01:34:27,Vatruvius,It is weird to think that my generation is one of the last to know what old computers with their accompanying large monitors and hard disk inserts looked like and performed. RIP retro computing.
09-03-2018T01:34:41,Bgrmystr2,I didn't have that problem sage. We had a separate line for phone and internet back then.
09-03-2018T01:34:55,Bgrmystr2,granted my dad owned his own computer shop back then so he required both
09-03-2018T01:35:06,Ordithus,... if you picked up the phone while someone was online all that would happen is you'd hear the horrible noises
09-03-2018T01:35:09,Bgrmystr2,"still, I don't know what it was like :("
09-03-2018T01:35:11,Ordithus,of the interwebs

09-03-2018T01:35:24,Vatruvius,lol
09-03-2018T01:35:47,Vatruvius,I curse Bethesda for making us wait so long for ES6
09-03-2018T01:36:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm sure Tom‚Äôs about ready to call it a night
09-03-2018T01:36:13,Vatruvius,"Just tell me what you are doing so I can forgive you, a new engine, new ideas/art, just tell me!"
09-03-2018T01:36:16,Dadrobit,"Eh, it'll happen. Just do other stuff til then"
09-03-2018T01:36:39,Vatruvius,How long has it been since ES5 release?
09-03-2018T01:36:49,Ordithus,over 6 years

09-03-2018T01:38:05,Dadrobit,MHW was the first game I did a midnight release stakeout since Skyrim actually.
09-03-2018T01:38:10,SageSaga,we dont need new video games anymore - we just need more monsters for monster hunter...
09-03-2018T01:38:20,Dadrobit,^
09-03-2018T01:38:24,neropan,"i'm still low rank , save me"

09-03-2018T01:40:58,ItsActuallyKopyKat,That's a cool tiger-dragon
09-03-2018T01:41:00,Vatruvius,So what actually was Maren and Karen doing together with Trace at the beginning of the comic when they said they would help him remember. He was all worried about Flore being 11 but he really should have been worried about Karen being 16 during that scene
09-03-2018T01:41:04,Ordithus,My back hurts all of a sudden
09-03-2018T01:41:12,SageSaga,lion dragon...

09-03-2018T01:42:24,Dadrobit,DS3 wasn't bad.

09-03-2018T01:42:51,ZRO4825,"Actually, screwit, ain't even discussing these here, just gonna get a lot of ""Well you need to get better/use this weapon instead"""

09-03-2018T01:44:58,Vatruvius,"I have not even gotten to the Legion boss fight yet, trying to beat the stupid crabs without spell cheese. Proving more difficult then intended."
09-03-2018T01:45:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Midir just made me angry to the point were I had to beat him
09-03-2018T01:45:01,SageSaga,i will do some runs with it and teach ya what you need to know

09-03-2018T01:49:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Then again he just may not want to talk to us weirdos
09-03-2018T01:49:12,InTheLionsDen,He is probably already asleep. This is just a bot doing the shading.
09-03-2018T01:49:13,Ordithus,Hi Unen
09-03-2018T01:49:16,SageSaga,is it a Tempered Bazel?

09-03-2018T01:49:33,Dadrobit,"Ughh, I'm actually feeling irritated just thinking about that fight."
09-03-2018T01:49:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Or maybe he‚Äôs sleep drawing
09-03-2018T01:49:37,Vatruvius,"This is Tom sleep walking. He does not walk, he draws."
09-03-2018T01:49:38,Dadrobit,Not healthy
09-03-2018T01:49:41,SageSaga,practice on the regular one so you can survive more hits- you'll see better when to dodge
09-03-2018T01:49:53,ZRO4825,Only thing worth fighting at this point is tempereds.  I can kill the normals without fail. =\
09-03-2018T01:49:54,Bgrmystr2,then it's not sleepwalking
09-03-2018T01:49:55,Twokinds,"Okay, I am finished."
09-03-2018T01:49:55,SageSaga,worse case- Superman dive

09-03-2018T01:50:16,SageSaga,Tempered doesnt get any extra HP or moves
09-03-2018T01:50:17,Ordithus,&lt;3 that scenery
09-03-2018T01:50:20,SageSaga,just more damage
09-03-2018T01:50:21,InTheLionsDen,The portal effect is well done Tom.
09-03-2018T01:50:23,ZRO4825,"Tried, didn't get the chance. Set down a health booster, in process of standing back, he charged from across the map where he was attacking my friend."
09-03-2018T01:50:25,Bgrmystr2,"This is lookin nice, Tom. Also, Tom, Rose's chest in the 3rd to last panel looks strange with the shading"
09-03-2018T01:50:41,ZRO4825,"Got to me before I got out of the animation, bowled me over, and before I could stand back up, ran back over me"

09-03-2018T01:51:18,Chippotatothefirst,Looks good
09-03-2018T01:51:21,SageSaga,while you are down you are invulnerable
09-03-2018T01:51:21,Bgrmystr2,"like, one of her breasts look bigger than the other :thinking:"
09-03-2018T01:51:24,ZRO4825,"And THAT right there Marv, is exactly why I hate talking about anything like this."
09-03-2018T01:51:47,Vatruvius,What are you looking at @Bgrmystr2
09-03-2018T01:51:48,SageSaga,Marv is just making a joke
09-03-2018T01:51:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Well that‚Äôs how it is for every woman in real life
09-03-2018T01:51:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I be a dick :D
09-03-2018T01:52:03,ZRO4825,I see nothing indicating that. And I'm very VERY irate atm.
09-03-2018T01:52:06,Ordithus,"I'm not seeing what you are, bgr"
09-03-2018T01:52:14,SageSaga,then you should cool down

09-03-2018T01:52:45,Dadrobit,"They're a little lopsided, not terrible unless you really examine 'em."
09-03-2018T01:52:54,Vatruvius,"I think it is more so just shirt placement, not shading or anything. Like if you twisted it would look like that. It looks fine to me."
09-03-2018T01:52:59,Ordithus,"Hold on, better get a close look"
09-03-2018T01:53:05,Bgrmystr2,"that's what I'm seeing, Dadro, the shading makes it look one one is bigger than the other"
09-03-2018T01:53:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"Every woman has one boob that‚Äôs bigger than the other. It‚Äôs most commonly the right, though"
09-03-2018T01:53:31,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-confused: not. . to that extent though?
09-03-2018T01:53:42,Vatruvius,Tom has spoken...or..er..drawn a conclusion.

09-03-2018T01:53:46,Ordithus,Rose seems indifferent to us staring at her boobs
09-03-2018T01:53:47,Vatruvius,that is a good pun
09-03-2018T01:53:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Depends on the woman
09-03-2018T01:53:58,Bgrmystr2,that doesn't look bad
09-03-2018T01:54:09,Vatruvius,What...no one like my pun?
09-03-2018T01:54:18,Vatruvius,Come on...it was good.

09-03-2018T01:56:01,unsteddyphoenix,Did Kat make Nat a bra? :thinking:
09-03-2018T01:56:04,Vatruvius,But didn't Kat create some sort of bra for Natani that she was too embarrassed to know what to do with?

09-03-2018T02:14:08,Vatruvius,****...too much to do!
09-03-2018T02:14:15,Ordithus,"I'm cool, yay! :ctwokinds-daydreamingkat:"
09-03-2018T02:14:30,SageSaga,no one said being cool was easy
09-03-2018T02:14:30,ZRO4825,"You think that's too much, start at the beginning of Yosh and come back when you're done &lt;_&lt;;"
09-03-2018T02:14:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Me Too :ctwokinds-daydreamingkat:
09-03-2018T02:15:22,Vatruvius,Lol...I am only joking around. This is actually my first time delving into this community. I ran into TwoKinds from watching some of Markiplier's old videos.
09-03-2018T02:16:06,SageSaga,you know how i first learned about Markiplier?
09-03-2018T02:16:08,Ordithus,"Well, welcome!"
09-03-2018T02:16:13,Vatruvius,From Tom
09-03-2018T02:16:27,Vatruvius,Thanks @Ordithus
09-03-2018T02:16:28,SageSaga,my friend sent me a message late at night-
09-03-2018T02:16:44,SageSaga,"""Oh great, my brother started making youtube videos."""
09-03-2018T02:16:50,Vatruvius,lol
09-03-2018T02:16:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
09-03-2018T02:17:16,Ordithus,He's come a long way.
09-03-2018T02:17:20,Vatruvius,I am pretty sure Tom was estatic when Mark asked him to come to his convention booth.
09-03-2018T02:17:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I thought Mark was an only child for the longest time til he mentioned Tom
09-03-2018T02:17:32,SageSaga,uhm
09-03-2018T02:17:39,Ordithus,I think it was the other way around
09-03-2018T02:17:47,SageSaga,yeah Tom was taking Mark to HIS booth
09-03-2018T02:17:52,Vatruvius,That was sarcasm.
09-03-2018T02:18:01,SageSaga,thats very bad sarcasm
09-03-2018T02:18:08,SageSaga,its ok- practice makes perfect
09-03-2018T02:18:17,Vatruvius,"I did not know tom had his own booth, he seemed camera shy"
09-03-2018T02:18:28,SageSaga,wait so it wasnt sarcasm
09-03-2018T02:18:29,Dadrobit,back
09-03-2018T02:18:34,SageSaga,you lied to us
09-03-2018T02:18:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a fan of cameras either
09-03-2018T02:18:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,wb dad
09-03-2018T02:19:12,Vatruvius,"It was, my impression of Tom is that he is camera shy and like is comic he was creating while Mark obviously is all over the place."
09-03-2018T02:19:14,Dadrobit,"Kind of. I really do need to hunt down a vampire at,"
09-03-2018T02:19:17,Dadrobit,atm*
09-03-2018T02:19:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Awww
09-03-2018T02:19:30,SageSaga,Mark wasnt always like that
09-03-2018T02:19:47,SpazztasticKiwi,The older sibling is usually the best behaved
09-03-2018T02:19:58,Vatruvius,"I know that, but as his channel grew he grew out."
09-03-2018T02:20:01,SageSaga,well Tom is the older Sibling-
09-03-2018T02:20:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Or maybe Mark just siphoned Tom‚Äôs extrovertedness as the years passed
09-03-2018T02:21:01,Ordithus,Like some strange succubus
09-03-2018T02:21:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Got the strange part right
09-03-2018T02:21:17,Vatruvius,"I am pretty sure Mark is still and introvert but has gotten used to the cameras, also who can really by that shy around people you love you?"
09-03-2018T02:21:26,SageSaga,you people are weird- im leaving in Kermits Flying Bath tub
09-03-2018T02:21:38,Vatruvius,who*
09-03-2018T02:21:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
09-03-2018T02:21:51,Vatruvius,"Well, at least I am tagged as something."
09-03-2018T02:22:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"He‚Äôs said he‚Äôs really an introvert, and I think he‚Äôs kind of like the ‚Äúlike-minded‚Äù introvert: someone who‚Äôs themselves everywhere but only likes to really socialize with those he knows"
09-03-2018T02:23:56,Vatruvius,"I relate to that, there are very few people who I can socialize with in real life. On the internet you find all these sub groups like this TwoKinds stream, or a youtube channel comments section, or a game chat."
09-03-2018T02:23:58,SageSaga,Jingo or Para?
09-03-2018T02:24:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,para
09-03-2018T02:24:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom may very well be the same way, except he‚Äôs less obvious since he doesn‚Äôt use a camera"
09-03-2018T02:24:53,SageSaga,he goes to conventions
09-03-2018T02:25:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"But who knows, I haven‚Äôt met either yet"
09-03-2018T02:25:04,SageSaga,in fact he and I are going to a Convention in a few months
09-03-2018T02:25:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Coolness
09-03-2018T02:25:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Comicon?
09-03-2018T02:25:40,Ordithus,"You two have known each other a looong time, right?"
09-03-2018T02:25:46,SageSaga,14 years
09-03-2018T02:26:02,Ordithus,Same as the comics.
09-03-2018T02:26:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Talk about childhood friend
09-03-2018T02:26:14,SageSaga,Childhood? i was an adult
09-03-2018T02:26:24,SageSaga,omg - i AM an adult
09-03-2018T02:26:30,Ordithus,haha
09-03-2018T02:26:34,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
09-03-2018T02:27:01,Bgrmystr2,xD
09-03-2018T02:27:15,SpazztasticKiwi,You‚Äôre only as old as you feel
09-03-2018T02:27:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Or believe
09-03-2018T02:27:33,SageSaga,my stomach feels like its 120 but i feel like im 22?
09-03-2018T02:27:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,your only as old as the make up makes you look
09-03-2018T02:27:52,SpazztasticKiwi,What con are you two going to
09-03-2018T02:28:01,SageSaga,MOMOCON
09-03-2018T02:28:16,Vatruvius,"If you were given the choice of immortality, would you take it?"
09-03-2018T02:28:26,SageSaga,but for the first time we arent going as guests or to sell stuff- we are going for- GASP! FUN!
09-03-2018T02:28:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,WooHoo \o/
09-03-2018T02:28:54,SageSaga,Immortality? Sure
09-03-2018T02:29:06,SageSaga,Especially if i could be a skeleton
09-03-2018T02:29:08,Vatruvius,Why though?
09-03-2018T02:29:44,Ordithus,Skeletons are ageless
09-03-2018T02:29:50,Vatruvius,"What would be your goal for being immortal, to see humanity's progress, watch the world slowly die, what?"
09-03-2018T02:29:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,because skele bros are cool
09-03-2018T02:29:55,SageSaga,i would make so much money in October
09-03-2018T02:29:58,Bgrmystr2,Thanks for streaming Sage :D
09-03-2018T02:30:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Thanks for the streamip sage
09-03-2018T02:30:13,Vatruvius,Too make a never ending comic?
09-03-2018T02:30:15,Bgrmystr2,"lookin forward to the page, missed the tail end of it"
09-03-2018T02:30:38,SageSaga,streaming the coloring of it tomorrow

09-03-2018T02:31:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,see ya sage
09-03-2018T02:33:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"Is Momo one of those cons you have to buy tickets for? It‚Äôs close to me, and I see the anime man is on the list, but"
09-03-2018T02:34:08,Vatruvius,"Goodnight everyone, I am going to get off and just read."
09-03-2018T02:34:14,SpazztasticKiwi,eh. I already have a vacation set up for April
09-03-2018T02:35:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll see
09-03-2018T02:37:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night ya'll
09-03-2018T02:42:20,Dadrobit,nIGHT sAGE
09-03-2018T02:42:24,Dadrobit,Caps...
09-03-2018T02:42:28,Dadrobit,"Night, Sage"
09-03-2018T02:42:40,Dadrobit,Night Vat
09-03-2018T02:42:47,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-natanisleep:
09-03-2018T02:42:51,w0lfmare,Night!
09-03-2018T02:42:59,Dadrobit,And all y'all that are going to sleep
09-03-2018T02:44:30,Dadrobit,"Dunno if I'm turning in myself or not. Having too much fun. Killed a vampire, bought a slave and pawned her off as a noble to be a cheiftan's wife, and got a thong as a reward."
09-03-2018T02:44:40,Dadrobit,Game Logic
09-03-2018T02:44:55,unsteddyphoenix,Is this Morrowind or Crusader Kings
09-03-2018T02:45:30,Dadrobit,Morrowind
09-03-2018T02:46:02,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds like the other
09-03-2018T02:46:05,unsteddyphoenix,Apart from the vampire
09-03-2018T02:46:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Someone just popping into this conversation would likely feel the need to nope right back out
09-03-2018T02:47:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Dead vampire + selling slave = thong?
09-03-2018T02:47:39,Dadrobit,Needed to make the chief happy so he would publicly call me the Neravarine.
09-03-2018T02:47:56,Dadrobit,Second coming of a dead war hero
09-03-2018T02:48:08,Dadrobit,(Hyper abridged explanation)
09-03-2018T02:48:25,unsteddyphoenix,Makes sense
09-03-2018T02:48:58,unsteddyphoenix,Whats weird about that
09-03-2018T02:50:46,Dadrobit,"Nothing, makes total sense. When people herald Morrowind as being GOAT game for its ""political intrigue"", this is what they are talking about."
09-03-2018T02:51:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Have fun with that - I have a full shift tomorrow
09-03-2018T02:51:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Nite
09-03-2018T02:52:04,unsteddyphoenix,goodnight goodluck
09-03-2018T02:52:23,unsteddyphoenix,"Wasnt hip enough to play Morrowind, no nostalgia"
09-03-2018T02:53:14,Dadrobit,Night Kiwi
09-03-2018T02:54:00,Dadrobit,Played it on my brother's XBox back in the day whenever he'd let me. Got it for myself when I was around 14(?) on PC.
09-03-2018T02:55:22,unsteddyphoenix,"Ahh, I was the older sibling dang"
09-03-2018T02:55:38,unsteddyphoenix,Unlucky
09-03-2018T02:56:24,Dadrobit,"Mmm, I was player 2."
09-03-2018T02:57:03,Dadrobit,Luigi/Tails/Rightor bottom screen.
09-03-2018T02:57:08,Dadrobit,Right or*
09-03-2018T02:58:35,unsteddyphoenix,Broken controller than wasnt actually plugged in?
09-03-2018T03:00:06,Dadrobit,*Vietnam Flashbacks*
09-03-2018T03:00:25,Dadrobit,"Naw, he was always much better than me anyways, didn't need to do stuff like that."
09-03-2018T03:20:44,unsteddyphoenix,nah nah nah
09-03-2018T03:20:49,unsteddyphoenix,Gotta do that for single player games
09-03-2018T03:21:27,unsteddyphoenix,"important strat, you probably jsut werent aware~"
09-03-2018T03:25:12,Dadrobit,"Oh, as in co-op that isn't?"
09-03-2018T03:25:55,unsteddyphoenix,"""look! You're that little flying bug next to me, the green guy!"""
09-03-2018T03:26:32,Dadrobit,"Naw, never did that."
09-03-2018T03:27:33,Dadrobit,I was pretty cognizant of what was or wasnt my gameplay.
09-03-2018T03:28:17,Dadrobit,(Read: I fully knew I was terrible at games until I was 7 or 8)
09-03-2018T03:28:28,Dadrobit,8 )*
09-03-2018T03:28:30,unsteddyphoenix,So you think~
09-03-2018T03:28:50,Dadrobit,That and we didn't really have games where you could pull that off?
09-03-2018T03:29:19,Dadrobit,"Mortal Kombat, either I was playing or I wasn't. I knew full well."
09-03-2018T03:29:55,Dadrobit,Same for Mario or Sonic.
09-03-2018T03:29:55,unsteddyphoenix,What no fighting games are the prime target for that
09-03-2018T03:30:16,unsteddyphoenix,AI can be more challenging than your sibling
09-03-2018T03:30:40,unsteddyphoenix,trust
09-03-2018T03:31:09,Dadrobit,"Man, did you do that kind of stuff to a sibling?"
09-03-2018T03:31:48,unsteddyphoenix,I never claimed to be good people
09-03-2018T03:31:52,Dadrobit,Wow
09-03-2018T03:32:11,Dadrobit,I affirm that I am a terrible person. Never did that to a child though.
09-03-2018T03:32:11,unsteddyphoenix,Plus whenever she played she just got fustated
09-03-2018T03:32:22,unsteddyphoenix,I was also a child!
09-03-2018T03:32:26,Dadrobit,Lol
09-03-2018T03:32:46,unsteddyphoenix,I aint 24 beating down this 5 year old
09-03-2018T03:32:51,Dadrobit,LOL
09-03-2018T03:32:51,unsteddyphoenix,I stopped doing that MONTHS ago
09-03-2018T03:32:56,Dadrobit,Jesus
09-03-2018T03:33:28,Dadrobit,"Naw, my brother took special pleasures in beating the crap out of me in games. From MK to Pokemon."
09-03-2018T03:33:55,Dadrobit,"Still brings it up to this day about how it made me ""better."""
09-03-2018T03:34:28,unsteddyphoenix,"Lol, tough love."
09-03-2018T03:34:36,unsteddyphoenix,Nah for me it was just super boring.
09-03-2018T03:34:44,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe you were slightly more challenging
09-03-2018T03:34:53,unsteddyphoenix,Just enough to make dunking you satisfying idk
09-03-2018T03:36:32,Dadrobit,"Maybe? He's about 4 years older than me I think, so the split was around 5 vs 9."
09-03-2018T03:38:06,Dadrobit,"I very distinctly recall vs-ing him in a game called Future Cop: LAPD. I could beat the AI, but he would be unkillable."
09-03-2018T03:39:03,Dadrobit,"I remember trying to play around him and beat him by playing the map essentially, but he was good at hunting me down... Very good...."
09-03-2018T03:55:36,unsteddyphoenix,haha
09-03-2018T03:55:39,unsteddyphoenix,Thats how it be
09-03-2018T03:55:55,unsteddyphoenix,I remember one time I played a pro-halo player
09-03-2018T03:56:16,unsteddyphoenix,"I got one kill, at that's from camping next to an exploding canister and blowing it as he walked past"
09-03-2018T05:13:53,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-laugh: sometimes, you gotta take what you can get phoenix"
09-03-2018T05:14:10,Bgrmystr2,map awareness is also a skill.
09-03-2018T05:33:48,unsteddyphoenix,Big agree. Most games it's super useful to have someone on your team with great map awareness.
09-03-2018T07:52:01,Immarshallity,Wow it's been a LOOOOONNNNNGGGGGG time since I've been here... And the stream's offline
09-03-2018T07:52:36,Immarshallity,Yup time to play Pokemon Omega Ruby on my 3ds.

09-03-2018T10:28:11,Nekonny,cause thats the only part of the day I'm truly affected by
09-03-2018T10:28:20,Pimsan,"If that is annoying, wait until on 20 March. The clock will be change then."
09-03-2018T10:28:31,Nekonny,?

09-03-2018T10:29:03,Mislakane,?????
09-03-2018T10:29:03,Pimsan,I meant the summer time.
09-03-2018T10:29:09,MoonlitCaitlyn,looks like the bot finally picked up your stream Neko
09-03-2018T10:29:49,Pimsan,On the 20th it will be summer time. And we get less sleep on that day.
09-03-2018T10:29:59,Pimsan,Or that is my understanding.
