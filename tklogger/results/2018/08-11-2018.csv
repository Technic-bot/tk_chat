08-11-2018T00:08:08,Bgrmystr2,I think flora sets herself on vibrate all on her own.

08-11-2018T11:21:57,Mippy,Good morning Tom! Had some nice thick cut bacon for breakfast.
08-11-2018T11:24:41,THETOXICATOR,Good evening

08-11-2018T13:28:39,TerraTheWizard,"yup, borked for me too"
08-11-2018T13:37:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Too bad it’s no longer Halloween
08-11-2018T13:37:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Nibbly with a candy corn smile would be cute
08-11-2018T13:39:15,ThingsAreMoving,":ctwokinds-power: there is no smile, just raw power"

08-11-2018T14:00:50,TerraTheWizard,:ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake:
08-11-2018T14:04:24,CrimsonQuill,This is the first thing I see on joining the chat.
08-11-2018T14:04:29,CrimsonQuill,What is going on?
08-11-2018T14:09:27,TerraTheWizard,"nibs eat sugar, get super magics"
08-11-2018T14:09:31,TerraTheWizard,clovis got spooked
08-11-2018T14:09:46,CrimsonQuill,Oh...kay...
08-11-2018T14:10:16,TerraTheWizard,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
08-11-2018T14:10:49,CrimsonQuill,Pretty much.
08-11-2018T14:11:01,CrimsonQuill,"I have proven myself to be a sad, sad person."
08-11-2018T14:11:34,CrimsonQuill,"Rather than thinking of a new suggestion for this week, I'm still trying to pull one through that I've had since the beginning."
08-11-2018T14:16:27,TerraTheWizard,how many times have you tried the same suggestion?
08-11-2018T14:17:42,CrimsonQuill,At least 12.
08-11-2018T14:18:00,CrimsonQuill,"I just really want to see a Halo crossover with Raine, my favourite character."
08-11-2018T14:20:10,CrimsonQuill,"I have tried UNSC AI Flora as well, but my main aim is to see Raine as a Spartan 4 from Halo 4 onwards."
08-11-2018T14:20:29,CrimsonQuill,"With Red as her Artificial intelligence, held in a chip in her hand."
08-11-2018T14:20:45,CrimsonQuill,"So yeah, I've been going the same route a while with no luck."
08-11-2018T14:20:51,TerraTheWizard,how well do they tend to do in the votes?
08-11-2018T14:21:15,CrimsonQuill,"Varies. Sometimes midway, sometimes near the bottom, or the top..."
08-11-2018T14:21:28,CrimsonQuill,But never in the first choice.
08-11-2018T14:21:31,CrimsonQuill,Sigh...
08-11-2018T14:21:49,TerraTheWizard,always a gamble with crossover sketches
08-11-2018T14:21:59,CrimsonQuill,Yeah.
08-11-2018T14:22:30,CrimsonQuill,"But I really liked the Rebel Raine and High Tech Flora sketches, so I'm going to keep going."
08-11-2018T14:22:49,CrimsonQuill,"That said, is it just me or has there been a jump in fanservice lately?"
08-11-2018T14:23:05,CrimsonQuill,"I mean, there are a lot of Gender Shenanigans about,"
08-11-2018T14:24:26,TerraTheWizard,kat is currently popular
08-11-2018T14:24:39,TerraTheWizard,and gender shenanigans have always been popular
08-11-2018T14:25:08,CrimsonQuill,I want to see a bit more action.
08-11-2018T14:25:21,TerraTheWizard,i personally want more of the silly sketches
08-11-2018T14:25:24,CrimsonQuill,"As in, spaceships. Fantasy battles."
08-11-2018T14:25:29,CrimsonQuill,And silly sketches too.
08-11-2018T14:25:30,TerraTheWizard,like that one with nibs and the jar of nuts
08-11-2018T14:25:34,CrimsonQuill,Those are fun.
08-11-2018T14:25:39,CrimsonQuill,Nibs went nuts there
08-11-2018T14:26:02,CrimsonQuill,I love the 'Knee jerk reaction' and 'traitorous leg' pranks.
08-11-2018T14:26:18,TerraTheWizard,"there's always the issue of, some fans will always want the more fanservice-y sketches"
08-11-2018T14:26:23,CrimsonQuill,I really love those sketches that capture the simple moments too.
08-11-2018T14:26:29,TerraTheWizard,and won't ever go for anything new
08-11-2018T14:26:43,CrimsonQuill,D'you recall the flower crown sketch? With Madelyn and Adelaide?
08-11-2018T14:26:56,TerraTheWizard,"""here's [female character] sunbathing for the nth time"""
08-11-2018T14:27:16,CrimsonQuill,I admit some of them are nice though. That said...
08-11-2018T14:27:29,TerraTheWizard,would be nice if people voted for more variety :P
08-11-2018T14:28:10,CrimsonQuill,"The picture where Maddie is giveing her mother a flower garland just gives me vibes of Sting's song, 'Fields of Gold'."
08-11-2018T14:28:32,CrimsonQuill,I'm re-reading the comic again-this time with my book volumes.
08-11-2018T14:28:38,CrimsonQuill,I have the four of them.
08-11-2018T14:29:33,CrimsonQuill,And I'm playing Undertale. Because Why not
08-11-2018T14:29:46,TerraTheWizard,i'm still waiting on vol 4
08-11-2018T14:29:54,CrimsonQuill,Shipping?
08-11-2018T14:30:03,TerraTheWizard,not even got the shipping info yet
08-11-2018T14:30:08,CrimsonQuill,Good grief.
08-11-2018T14:30:09,TerraTheWizard,darn slow on international
08-11-2018T14:30:17,CrimsonQuill,Maybe if you email them it might help.
08-11-2018T14:30:22,CrimsonQuill,I emailed them a few times.
08-11-2018T14:30:50,TerraTheWizard,"already did, just get the ""sorry, we're really busy, please could you wit a little longer"""
08-11-2018T14:30:55,TerraTheWizard,*wait
08-11-2018T14:31:07,CrimsonQuill,They are probably very busy there.
08-11-2018T14:31:59,TerraTheWizard,ordered it like 10 minutes after it went up for pre-order
08-11-2018T14:32:07,TerraTheWizard,gonna be one of the last to receive it
08-11-2018T14:32:13,CrimsonQuill,I ordered it a few days after.
08-11-2018T14:32:27,CrimsonQuill,"I was a bit low on budget, but I really wanted a nice hardback."
08-11-2018T14:32:33,CrimsonQuill,I have the one with the Raine print.
08-11-2018T14:32:44,TerraTheWizard,next time ima have to wait until like 3 more books are out
08-11-2018T14:32:50,TerraTheWizard,the intl shipping is PRICEY
08-11-2018T14:33:12,CrimsonQuill,My country has a cheaper alternative than int. shipping.
08-11-2018T14:33:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Doctor says no work till Monday. I have antibiotics and a sinus decongestant in the works
08-11-2018T14:33:44,CrimsonQuill,Ouch. That sounds unpleasant.
08-11-2018T14:34:04,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I for one hope you become a bit better soon."
08-11-2018T14:34:06,TerraTheWizard,how much do  you pay for the shipping?
08-11-2018T14:34:15,CrimsonQuill,About twenty euros
08-11-2018T14:34:18,TerraTheWizard,i had to pay like $50
08-11-2018T14:34:22,CrimsonQuill,I know
08-11-2018T14:34:27,CrimsonQuill,More than the book itself
08-11-2018T14:34:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"Sinus infection. Like I thought. But with the temperature, I shouldn’t be in public"
08-11-2018T14:34:47,TerraTheWizard,also i was a dumb & if i'd waited like 20 mins to order i coulda used the discount code :V
08-11-2018T14:34:54,CrimsonQuill,Does it hurt a lot?
08-11-2018T14:35:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Not really
08-11-2018T14:35:05,SpazztasticKiwi,On meds rn
08-11-2018T14:35:05,CrimsonQuill,@TerraTheWizard I was able to use the discount
08-11-2018T14:35:05,TerraTheWizard,rip kiwi
08-11-2018T14:35:30,SpazztasticKiwi,But the prescription was cheap even with no insurance
08-11-2018T14:35:45,CrimsonQuill,I'm multitasking here. And failing badly. Tip to you guys-never play Undertale whilst in a group chat.
08-11-2018T14:49:12,Dadrobit,:/ Not just international shipping unfortunately. I was a day 1 pre-order in the US and I still haven't received any kind of notification either...
08-11-2018T14:49:55,CrimsonQuill,Woah. And I thought I had it bad waiting till the end of October.
08-11-2018T14:54:59,CrimsonQuill,"Well, I'm off for now. I'll catch the chat again later. Cheerio! :ptv-greetings::ptv-greetings:"
08-11-2018T14:55:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I can see those storms delaying it but at this point I want to know what the excuse is
08-11-2018T15:30:52,SpazztasticKiwi,🥪
08-11-2018T15:55:06,TerraTheWizard,i hate macs
08-11-2018T15:55:10,TerraTheWizard,also printers
08-11-2018T15:55:23,TerraTheWizard,but macs more
08-11-2018T15:58:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Macs don’t seem to like me either
08-11-2018T15:58:32,Twokinds,:hamburger:
08-11-2018T15:59:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll swing for a big mac
08-11-2018T15:59:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"But the computer ones, pass"
08-11-2018T15:59:37,SpazztasticKiwi,And no onions
08-11-2018T16:00:52,Twokinds,Just needs more bytes
08-11-2018T16:03:06,SpazztasticKiwi,And durability
08-11-2018T16:05:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I refuse to believe cats are an apex predator. I just had to point out this tidbit of my sandwich to Bagheera four times
08-11-2018T16:05:23,Twokinds,lol
08-11-2018T16:05:32,Twokinds,I've had to do that a few times when giving my cat chicken.
08-11-2018T16:05:49,Twokinds,There's nothing wrong with her eyesight but somehow she just misses where I put it.
08-11-2018T16:06:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"“Right here. No - here. Bagheera, ~here~. AT THE END PF MY FINGER.”"
08-11-2018T16:07:08,ThingsAreMoving,Cats excel at hunting. If you'd put that bit of chicken on a piece of string and move it around it would've been caught faster than you'd realise
08-11-2018T16:07:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera runs into walls while chasing toys
08-11-2018T16:08:21,ThingsAreMoving,but does he get the toy while running into walls?
08-11-2018T16:08:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Eventually
08-11-2018T16:08:51,TerraTheWizard,derpkitty
08-11-2018T16:09:05,ThingsAreMoving,that's how you get pug cats
08-11-2018T16:09:17,ThingsAreMoving,or however they're called
08-11-2018T16:09:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Persians
08-11-2018T16:10:19,ThingsAreMoving,https://imgur.com/rhSFxA5
08-11-2018T16:10:32,ThingsAreMoving,that a persian?
08-11-2018T16:10:35,ThingsAreMoving,idk
08-11-2018T16:10:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah
08-11-2018T16:11:01,TerraTheWizard,oh goodness
08-11-2018T16:11:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Someone gave it a haircut
08-11-2018T16:12:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Kiwi has a bit of a smushed in nose. Makes me think she’s part persain
08-11-2018T16:13:02,SpazztasticKiwi,But I don’t know for sure and a dna test would cost too much to really be worth it
08-11-2018T16:16:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Would Holly even chase the chicken if you tied it to a string. Based on what you’ve said before I’m not sure she’d care to put forth the effort
08-11-2018T16:20:35,ThingsAreMoving,"You think she's at ""bring me lasagna, hooman"" stage?"
08-11-2018T16:23:11,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s a possibility if she shows no interest in boxes and general cat toys
08-11-2018T16:27:45,Twokinds,Holly does like chicken
08-11-2018T16:27:56,Twokinds,Couldn't reply for a while because Holly was in the way of my keyboard
08-11-2018T16:28:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Why you move kitty. Kitty was comfy
08-11-2018T16:29:34,TerraTheWizard,hehe
08-11-2018T16:29:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I currently have Kiwi on a new diet kibble. She loves it pretty well but the portion size is what’s getting to her
08-11-2018T16:31:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Meanwhile Bagheera has his own regular kibble for indoor cat
08-11-2018T16:33:21,SpazztasticKiwi,But they both get a tidbit now and then. For good behavior
08-11-2018T16:36:16,Mippy,:ctwokinds-flomad:
08-11-2018T16:37:00,Bgrmystr2,"I have no idea what happened last night, chat broke as usual. :ptv-pouty:"
08-11-2018T16:38:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Not much
08-11-2018T16:38:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I went to bed early but ended up right back about an hour later
08-11-2018T16:39:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Good news is I got some antibiotics now so I can be back at work Monday
08-11-2018T16:41:02,Mippy,Yahoo 🥝
08-11-2018T16:41:47,SpazztasticKiwi,And the entire thing didn’t even cost a whole lot
08-11-2018T16:41:53,Mippy,You keep it’s a good time if you can’t tell if your co workers are playing Country or Christian music. :ctwokinds-keifacepalm:
08-11-2018T16:42:06,Mippy,*know
08-11-2018T16:42:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Down here there’s little difference between the two
08-11-2018T16:42:47,Mippy,That’s good to hear. I understand American medical bills can be atrocious
08-11-2018T16:43:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I swear if there comes a day “Sweet Home Alabama” is taken off the air I will celebrate
08-11-2018T16:43:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m also in one of the cheaper states so there’s that
08-11-2018T16:43:55,SpazztasticKiwi,As annoying as it can be
08-11-2018T16:44:28,Mippy,Just once I’d love someone at work to blast some Rammstien....
08-11-2018T16:45:22,SpazztasticKiwi,If my playlist got played at work I’d get quite a few odd looks
08-11-2018T16:45:43,SpazztasticKiwi,And a few “you need Jesus”
08-11-2018T16:47:01,Mippy,XD we did play my list once. Rob Zombie came on. XD it was an interesting experience.
08-11-2018T16:48:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I live in the Bible Belt. People can be offended if the word sex is in a song
08-11-2018T16:49:44,Mippy,Trust me...I’m in a hick town. People are proud of it.
08-11-2018T16:51:10,Bgrmystr2,lol Kiwi I like that song :(
08-11-2018T16:51:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Move here. That’ll change
08-11-2018T16:51:39,Mippy,That’s ok Bgr....*hugs*
08-11-2018T16:51:49,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s played on the radio at least once a day
08-11-2018T16:51:57,Bgrmystr2,"not likely, cuz Alabama is not likely any worse than Louisiana."
08-11-2018T16:52:11,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. we're right next door
08-11-2018T16:52:39,SpazztasticKiwi,A boy I went to preschool with was found in the woods with a shotgun bullet in his back
08-11-2018T16:52:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause he was gay
08-11-2018T16:52:55,Mippy,Oh gosh! If I hear one more bad cover song tonight...:ctwokinds-power:
08-11-2018T16:52:59,SpazztasticKiwi,That was only a few years ago
08-11-2018T16:53:57,Bgrmystr2,yeah well..
08-11-2018T16:54:18,SpazztasticKiwi,And yes the teens (18) that lured him out there were arrested and jailed for it
08-11-2018T16:54:46,Bgrmystr2,the other night someone broke into the Criminal District Court house.. just to get into the evidence room
08-11-2018T16:54:53,Mippy,Kiwi...I can honestly see that happening in my city. It’s a sad truth that a lot of places still are not LGBT+ safe. At least something was done.
08-11-2018T16:54:56,Bgrmystr2,So there's no lack of idiots here
08-11-2018T16:55:25,Bgrmystr2,"well noone should get shot over it, Mippy"

08-11-2018T17:02:28,Mippy,"Yup, and openly so. There was a African guy who came into my work place and was openly and rather noisily yelling racial slurs at my Filipino co worker. And a white guy who referred to them as “pineapple pickers”. Some people are pretty nasty about it."

08-11-2018T20:03:28,Bgrmystr2,I associate allergies with something other people have that I can't fathom..
08-11-2018T20:03:34,Bgrmystr2,since I don't have any :thinking:

08-11-2018T20:10:45,CrRAR,Ben Stein and Gilbert Gottfried should team up.
08-11-2018T20:10:48,Bgrmystr2,as much as I hate the commercials here cuz they never end
08-11-2018T20:10:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Well that’s essentially what it is
08-11-2018T20:10:58,CrRAR,That's a duo that would be UNSTOPPABLE.
08-11-2018T20:11:16,Bgrmystr2,there are some commericals that are gold-award meme worthy

08-11-2018T20:14:26,CrRAR,That guy reminded me a little of Lance Bass there for a second.
08-11-2018T20:14:43,SpazztasticKiwi,That guy is Thomas Sanders
08-11-2018T20:15:43,CrRAR,lol pretty funny
08-11-2018T20:16:16,CrRAR,He shoulda ended it with a irate farmer guy chasing him off the property shotgun in tow.
08-11-2018T20:17:14,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s his general stitch: parodies and impressions
08-11-2018T20:17:38,CrRAR,I approve!
08-11-2018T20:17:47,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s also got one where he calls shotgun...with a shotgun
08-11-2018T20:18:03,CrRAR,iiiinteresting
08-11-2018T20:18:46,Bgrmystr2,that ending hahaha
08-11-2018T20:18:48,CrRAR,lol just saw it
08-11-2018T20:19:15,CrRAR,Never EVER argue... with shotgun guy.
08-11-2018T20:19:30,CrRAR,(or that rico suave hair)
08-11-2018T20:20:09,SpazztasticKiwi,He is quite a dream isnt he
08-11-2018T20:20:42,CrRAR,:ptv-excited:
08-11-2018T20:20:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark once did a video where he asked if there was anyone the fandom wanted him to collaborate with
08-11-2018T20:21:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Entire first page of comments was screaming for Thomas Sanders
08-11-2018T20:21:25,CrRAR,Asking the internet a question... that's a dangerous move.
08-11-2018T20:21:40,CrRAR,...but yeah that's a decent outcome.
08-11-2018T20:22:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Well it was mainly Thomas Sanders and Shane Dawson
08-11-2018T20:23:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"But Thomas has a great bit of interest in the same things like skits, comedy, and covers, like Mark"
08-11-2018T20:23:18,CrRAR,The level of rambunctious would be overwhelming.
08-11-2018T20:23:39,SpazztasticKiwi,The problem is Thomas is based in Florida
08-11-2018T20:23:55,CrRAR,damn
08-11-2018T20:24:23,SpazztasticKiwi,You can hear the tears of millions of fangirls
08-11-2018T20:26:05,CrRAR,"very sad indeed. I get the sense that their collab skit would end with them riding a tank, covered in Christmas regalia, to the nearest petshop, to a acquire a dozen of the CUDDLIEST rabbits."
08-11-2018T20:26:22,CrRAR,Next step: ???
08-11-2018T20:26:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"Mark, Thomas, and a dozen bunnies. That’s how the world ends"
08-11-2018T20:27:26,CrRAR,"perfect, I'd accept that."
08-11-2018T20:28:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark did joke about a Markiplier themed carnival thing. Maybe Thomas could guest star
08-11-2018T20:28:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Though that would require some security
08-11-2018T20:31:51,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s collabed with John of Paint with the YouTube vs Vine song
08-11-2018T20:34:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though if you don’t know John, he’s a bit of another type of gift. He does Disney parodies"

08-11-2018T20:53:32,RimaDraws,i mean its not a deal if it was already the same price the deal is after they raise the price

08-11-2018T21:45:20,SageSaga,after i got mine back after grading- i showed her it contained a secret message
08-11-2018T21:45:36,FennexTheFox,something something jello
08-11-2018T21:45:46,totallynotTrace,I wouldnt have passed high school if i only did the tests as they are not a majority for the grade
08-11-2018T21:45:49,SageSaga,"""Taking the first letter of each line spells out - ""Penguins will not be oppressed"""
08-11-2018T21:45:55,FennexTheFox,holy shit sage
08-11-2018T21:46:04,Bgrmystr2,haha sage damn

08-11-2018T21:46:25,Mippy,Good show Sage
08-11-2018T21:46:34,SageSaga,never saw it
08-11-2018T21:46:47,totallynotTrace,March of the Penguins?
08-11-2018T21:46:47,FennexTheFox,but penguins innit!
08-11-2018T21:46:48,w0lfmare,My teachers were convinced I had ADHD so I spent a lot of time out of class passing ADHD tests instead of studying the stuff they were supposed to teach
08-11-2018T21:47:03,Wertgard,"Well, it was stressful on school for me because of relationship within the class"
08-11-2018T21:47:05,Kameloh,"huh, that's really interesting :eyes:"
08-11-2018T21:47:11,SageSaga,this was way back folks- my grade school years-
08-11-2018T21:47:17,SageSaga,some of you probably werent born
08-11-2018T21:47:30,Kameloh,I was told I had ADHD when I was a kid but I think gaming helped me focus
08-11-2018T21:47:31,Mihari,"All you hardcore TK fans can probably help with this, has Mike ever been in an actual cocktail dress?"
08-11-2018T21:47:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,He was getting fit'd for one
08-11-2018T21:47:54,totallynotTrace,not in the main comic
08-11-2018T21:47:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,thats about as far as it went
08-11-2018T21:48:02,w0lfmare,I was too caught up in my own imagination and didn't find school engaging
08-11-2018T21:48:14,Kameloh,same :crocodile:
08-11-2018T21:48:22,totallynotTrace,very much same
08-11-2018T21:48:32,w0lfmare,So obviously I turned my overactive imagination into a good thing
08-11-2018T21:48:44,Kameloh,"yee, still can't believe you made a game and everything"
08-11-2018T21:48:51,Kameloh,that was super impressive
08-11-2018T21:49:07,JazzmasterJ,"Teach me your ways of game making, w0lf :ptv-left:"
08-11-2018T21:49:18,BadFoMo,Hi.
08-11-2018T21:49:22,Wertgard,Wof is really good with things if wants to

08-11-2018T21:49:53,SageSaga,my old Spanish teacher stopped me at Walmart a few months back
08-11-2018T21:49:57,MikeHollard,Nice drawing Sage
08-11-2018T21:50:01,w0lfmare,Yee I want to make a game again that was fun
08-11-2018T21:50:12,Mippy,Hanging on your every word Sage
08-11-2018T21:50:13,Kameloh,:ptv-sneakysmirk:
08-11-2018T21:50:19,SageSaga,"and said ""I still use the Santa Claus you drew for my classroom door decoration"
08-11-2018T21:50:24,w0lfmare,Though I still see it more as a prototype
08-11-2018T21:50:25,Kynum,LOL
08-11-2018T21:50:37,totallynotTrace,I was diagnosed with autism early on in grade school but as the years whent on teachers didnt understand why in some areas I wasnt proggressing as expected and in some areas i was going downhill then highschool came and we reallized I had depression
08-11-2018T21:50:38,Kynum,that's awesome
08-11-2018T21:50:40,Kameloh,w0lf let's learn unity or unreal :clap:
08-11-2018T21:50:42,Wertgard,Hi Kynum
08-11-2018T21:50:51,SageSaga,i drew a lifesized drawing of Santa for her door waaaay back
08-11-2018T21:50:58,totallynotTrace,and once we got that figured out treatment brought me uphill
08-11-2018T21:51:05,ProsePro7,Jazzy Jazz
08-11-2018T21:51:09,BadFoMo,@w0lfmare What game?
08-11-2018T21:51:12,Mippy,Dang! Santa left an impression
08-11-2018T21:51:15,w0lfmare,Yeah minds are complicated
08-11-2018T21:51:19,Combak,That's awesome Sage!
08-11-2018T21:51:25,totallynotTrace,very much so
08-11-2018T21:51:34,SageSaga,i bet it looks terrible :P
08-11-2018T21:51:53,Wertgard,"Wof, I think that they are. But only because game in very early stage"
08-11-2018T21:51:56,Mippy,You’ll never know :csagesaga-nynasmirk:
08-11-2018T21:51:59,w0lfmare,@BadFoMo It isn't released anywhere. I made a game based in the universe of my comic back in the day
08-11-2018T21:52:01,totallynotTrace,and the american school system doesnt have propper funding in many areas to properly deal with mental health
08-11-2018T21:52:04,Kynum,"Did you scan it and print it out on something, or did you give teacher the original?"
08-11-2018T21:52:07,Combak,"Only to the artist, who knows all its flaws personally. XD"
08-11-2018T21:52:17,Kameloh,it was totally a bullet hell :ckameloh-bustin:
08-11-2018T21:52:19,SageSaga,yeah no way am i gonna go back into a school- those places are dangerous
08-11-2018T21:52:35,Rosscoe,"Well I must depart for work, Later everyone!"
08-11-2018T21:52:39,Kynum,later
08-11-2018T21:52:44,FoxxTrotter,C-ya. Rosscoe.
08-11-2018T21:52:45,SageSaga,i drew it on a giant sheet of paper and colored it
08-11-2018T21:52:49,totallynotTrace,i occasionally go back to my highschool to mentor my robotics team
08-11-2018T21:52:50,w0lfmare,See ya Ross o/
08-11-2018T21:52:57,Combak,Bye Rosscoe!
08-11-2018T21:53:03,SageSaga,Door Sized paper
08-11-2018T21:53:06,BadFoMo,@w0lfmare Cool! ...Which engin did you use?
08-11-2018T21:53:21,w0lfmare,I used Game Maker. Super easy to learn
08-11-2018T21:53:26,Mippy,My high school is in another province *shrug*
08-11-2018T21:54:02,w0lfmare,Though I do want to move and try Unity someday
08-11-2018T21:54:09,Mippy,It’s really not worth going back too
08-11-2018T21:54:23,totallynotTrace,it takes me about 20-30 minutes to walk through the woods to my High school
08-11-2018T21:54:23,Kameloh,could learn C# -- I can teach you maybe :eyes:
08-11-2018T21:54:38,Kynum,Good gravy! Door sized paper?! what was the gsm on it?
08-11-2018T21:54:58,MikeHollard,how long does it take from Tom to finish one fully detailed and colored sketch?
08-11-2018T21:55:09,Kynum,as long as it takes.
08-11-2018T21:55:36,eric190,ugh. picarto has started pausing streams when the website loads. . . .
08-11-2018T21:55:38,Mihari,"It depends on the content, if he hates the image or not, the amount of details, etc."
08-11-2018T21:55:41,totallynotTrace,depends on the sketch. ie detail level and stuff
08-11-2018T21:55:48,Mippy,My elementary/middle school on the other hand...I’d really love to visit the site it use to be. It would just take a lot of money and planning
08-11-2018T21:55:52,JazzmasterJ,Why learn C# when you can learn C kame :ptv-kippi2:
08-11-2018T21:56:12,totallynotTrace,ive seen as short as 45 minutes and sometimes several hours
08-11-2018T21:56:23,Kameloh,jazz :weary:
08-11-2018T21:56:32,BadFoMo,"I know little to nothing about Game Maker. I mostly work with the L4D version of Source; and by that, I mean I try the aid my 'friend' with his Let's Buind campaine."
08-11-2018T21:56:47,BadFoMo,*Build
08-11-2018T21:57:24,w0lfmare,Is C# better than java? :eyes:
08-11-2018T21:57:31,Twokinds,brb
08-11-2018T21:57:41,Mihari,"One could argue anything is better than Java, but..."
08-11-2018T21:57:44,Combak,Oh god W0lf...
08-11-2018T21:57:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"He left us, He left us!"
08-11-2018T21:57:56,JazzmasterJ,"There no better code than the other, w0lf. Just pic whichever you prefer"
08-11-2018T21:58:00,Combak,Now there's a huge can of worms. XD
08-11-2018T21:58:09,totallynotTrace,dont tell the minecraft fanboys that @Mihari
08-11-2018T21:58:13,Combak,"Well, let's be clear here..."
08-11-2018T21:58:31,Bgrmystr2,"the fanboys couldn't tell you anything about the code, nottrace."
08-11-2018T21:58:33,SageSaga,uhh- The Minecraft fanboys hate that it is limited by Java
08-11-2018T21:58:35,Mihari,"I would, cause I imagine what a full coded C Minecrat could have been with lua support."
08-11-2018T21:58:48,w0lfmare,"All I know is GML, which if I recall is a super dumbed down Java"
08-11-2018T21:58:50,Bgrmystr2,and those who know about code know the limitations
08-11-2018T21:58:56,Mihari,"Gawd, I imagine modding with lua and modules, it would be amazing."
08-11-2018T21:59:03,Combak,"A lower level language is harder to learn and can be a pain to use, but it's more flexible and less likely to break over time."
08-11-2018T21:59:13,Tharkis,"mmm, scripting support"
08-11-2018T21:59:22,JazzmasterJ,Make a game in assembly
08-11-2018T21:59:27,Combak,"A higher level language is easier to use, but tends to he highly constrained."
08-11-2018T21:59:31,JazzmasterJ,:clap:
08-11-2018T21:59:36,ProsePro7,So who is Raine meeting?
08-11-2018T21:59:37,Combak,Like Roller Coaster Tycoon Jazz?
08-11-2018T21:59:45,Bgrmystr2,funny that the whole idea of minecraft was a challenge to see if he could make a working game using java
08-11-2018T21:59:48,Bgrmystr2,and succeeded
08-11-2018T21:59:49,totallynotTrace,a FRIEND

08-11-2018T22:00:45,BadFoMo,@ProsePro7 She's meeting Clovis; for busness.
08-11-2018T22:00:53,Combak,Or Fem Red. :ptv-kippi2:
08-11-2018T22:01:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:nauseated_face:
08-11-2018T22:01:14,ProsePro7,I approve Fem Red more than Fem Zen
08-11-2018T22:01:19,BadFoMo,"Also, is that Maddiy and Maeve I spy?"
08-11-2018T22:01:22,ProsePro7,Zen x Kat
08-11-2018T22:01:23,w0lfmare,That's okay Mippy
08-11-2018T22:01:24,Mippy,Is that :ctwokinds-maevecute:+•:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles: in the background?
08-11-2018T22:01:29,Bgrmystr2,yes
08-11-2018T22:01:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,But Red x Sythe
08-11-2018T22:01:38,ProsePro7,NO
08-11-2018T22:01:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Yes
08-11-2018T22:01:46,w0lfmare,I barely know anything coding myself :cw0lfmare-Paperember:

08-11-2018T22:01:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:)
08-11-2018T22:02:00,Kameloh,it's super easy :clap:

08-11-2018T22:02:10,Mippy,Thanks w0lf
08-11-2018T22:02:19,Kameloh,<insert more code here>
08-11-2018T22:02:23,steelabjur,"Likely Mippy, they were in the previous sketch."
08-11-2018T22:02:26,BadFoMo,I think I know no coding.
08-11-2018T22:02:32,ProsePro7,Insert coin to code
08-11-2018T22:02:33,JazzmasterJ,int counter  = 0
08-11-2018T22:02:45,JazzmasterJ,then loop that counter to infinity
08-11-2018T22:02:48,Bgrmystr2,"if you have to think about it fomo, the answer is pretty clear. :P"
08-11-2018T22:02:50,Kameloh,string number = '1'; :ckameloh-blink:

08-11-2018T22:03:01,ProsePro7,String theory
08-11-2018T22:03:35,JazzmasterJ,"parseInt that string, kame"
08-11-2018T22:03:37,ProsePro7,Oh...I get it thats Clovis
08-11-2018T22:03:56,BadFoMo,@Bgrmystr2 I say that due to know knowing if .VMT count as coding.
08-11-2018T22:03:56,Mippy,I was here for this sketch but I completely missed them...I think I may have been paying too much attention to Clovis
08-11-2018T22:04:16,w0lfmare,Oh fun fact Undertale was made with Game Maker
08-11-2018T22:04:19,BadFoMo,*to not knowing
08-11-2018T22:04:32,Combak,"Wait, really?"
08-11-2018T22:04:34,ProsePro7,Undertale made a deal with the devil
08-11-2018T22:04:40,JazzmasterJ,TobyFox's crazy to make undertale in gamemaker
08-11-2018T22:04:41,totallynotTrace,cool
08-11-2018T22:04:55,JazzmasterJ,same for deltarune. For a boss I won't spoil
08-11-2018T22:04:57,Combak,"Well, I guess that explains why the code for it is considered to be a horrible mess. XD"
08-11-2018T22:04:58,ProsePro7,Its like Frozen I understand why its good but I dont get the hype
08-11-2018T22:05:22,totallynotTrace,dont know anything about gamemaker other than what has been said so far in chat
08-11-2018T22:05:29,totallynotTrace,same Prose
08-11-2018T22:05:30,steelabjur,I enjoy messing with code in RPG Maker for what it's worth. :p
08-11-2018T22:05:45,ProsePro7,Coding 101 with TwoKinds Chat
08-11-2018T22:05:45,Bgrmystr2,"because not many games make gamers question the very choices they take for granted in basically every other game they've ever played, Prose."
08-11-2018T22:05:53,Bgrmystr2,that was Undertale's biggest draw.
08-11-2018T22:06:07,ProsePro7,Next week Theoretical Physics
08-11-2018T22:07:01,ShadowSoap,"Good Evening, y'all!"
08-11-2018T22:07:04,ProsePro7,I get it Bgr but like I said its the obsession I dont get
08-11-2018T22:07:05,totallynotTrace,Shadow of the Colossus was (although not an rpg) pretty good at making you feel like an a%%hole
08-11-2018T22:07:06,Combak,Hi Soap!
08-11-2018T22:07:29,ShadowSoap,How were ya weeks?
08-11-2018T22:07:29,BadFoMo,@ProsePro7 The following week; Art of the Crowbar.
08-11-2018T22:07:34,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, Soap."
08-11-2018T22:07:42,BadFoMo,"Also, Yo."
08-11-2018T22:07:47,steelabjur,"I like the ""Vixen Vixen"" sign..."
08-11-2018T22:07:53,MikeHollard,teach me how to art
08-11-2018T22:07:59,ProsePro7,In artistic expression or use?
08-11-2018T22:08:00,Bgrmystr2,"lol Prose, what's the obsession with art? Or cars? Or games? Or fast food? Or anything?"
08-11-2018T22:08:06,Combak,"For that Prose, you need to know that there's a lot of stuff that's hidden or just hinted at, so there's room for interpretation. Plus, that makes people build the story themself."
08-11-2018T22:08:08,Bgrmystr2,same thing xD
08-11-2018T22:08:22,ProsePro7,True Bgr
08-11-2018T22:08:27,Eternity1,hello
08-11-2018T22:08:34,ProsePro7,Bonjour

08-11-2018T22:08:44,ShadowSoap,Salut
08-11-2018T22:09:08,BadFoMo,@ProsePro7 Use. It will be needed for the HeadCrab Zombies.
08-11-2018T22:09:10,FennexTheFox,i love the maeve and maddie <3
08-11-2018T22:09:21,MikeHollard,Half Life 2 my favourite game
08-11-2018T22:09:33,MikeHollard,Oh my god it the borealis!
08-11-2018T22:09:37,ProsePro7,As soon as Half Life 3 comes out
08-11-2018T22:09:51,totallynotTrace,Half Life 3 I want to believe
08-11-2018T22:10:22,MikeHollard,"There is fan games, Project Borealis"
08-11-2018T22:10:25,ShadowSoap,I can't really pick out one game to be a favorite...
08-11-2018T22:10:28,steelabjur,"@Combak, that's why I like H.P. Lovecraft's stories, he tells just enough for your mind to fill in details that an author couldn't match."
08-11-2018T22:11:33,ProsePro7,Damn.  Toms gonna pull a long one on this sketch
08-11-2018T22:11:45,Bgrmystr2,"the mind is the best storyteller, because it allows the user to make their own story in such a way that they'd naturally like it"
08-11-2018T22:11:52,ShadowSoap,Lots of tiny details to take care of.
08-11-2018T22:11:56,Wertgard,People still want to believe. Nice
08-11-2018T22:12:14,FennexTheFox,"Make sure to get some rest at some point, Tom."
08-11-2018T22:12:49,Twokinds,Heheh
08-11-2018T22:12:53,Twokinds,I'll rest when it's all done
08-11-2018T22:13:11,FennexTheFox,;-;
08-11-2018T22:13:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"3 days later, not done yet"
08-11-2018T22:13:16,FennexTheFox,oof
08-11-2018T22:13:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,no rest for the wicked
08-11-2018T22:13:42,ShadowSoap,"Ahhhh, Borderlands"
08-11-2018T22:13:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Just don’t think about food
