02-09-2018T00:00:11,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno for how long, exactly.. but"
02-09-2018T00:00:17,Bgrmystr2,yeah
02-09-2018T00:00:29,Bgrmystr2,the events add up
02-09-2018T00:01:12,Kinipshun,"i need to read tk again form the start. i haven't done it in a while, so a lot of stuff is fuzzy to me"
02-09-2018T00:01:29,Bgrmystr2,"and maybe, phoenix, I'm just not sure if Rose and Saria would have lived in a place that took random keidran and sold them into slavery"
02-09-2018T00:02:06,Bgrmystr2,dunno too much about the towns or how widespread slavery was at the time
02-09-2018T00:02:21,Bgrmystr2,"I know it was less so before trace came into power, but not sure by how much"
02-09-2018T00:02:49,Bgrmystr2,is tom still even here? :o
02-09-2018T00:02:54,unsteddyphoenix,Dunno. Just that saria seemed pretty prideful and defiant
02-09-2018T00:03:05,Bgrmystr2,yeah you're right on that
02-09-2018T00:03:57,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. maybe trace goes over to her house to talk and they have food and suddenly there's this white wolf sitting at the table lol
02-09-2018T00:04:11,Bgrmystr2,where the fok that thing come from it wasn't here last time! :ptv-shock:
02-09-2018T00:04:22,Bgrmystr2,maybe lol
02-09-2018T00:04:50,Kinipshun,"saria: ""this is my FRIEND rose"""
02-09-2018T00:04:54,unsteddyphoenix,"Saria giving a look like ""i DARE you to say something"""
02-09-2018T00:04:59,Bgrmystr2,xD
02-09-2018T00:05:47,Bgrmystr2,"Trace with the lowkey : ""I'm shure.. it's.. nice.. it'll be nice to me right? Yeah uhhuh.."""
02-09-2018T00:06:14,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-angry: *[""IT?!""]"
02-09-2018T00:06:19,Bgrmystr2,etc
02-09-2018T00:06:32,Dadrobit,"Mmm, just got back from making a post on the forums defending Zen. T-Minus ""X"" minutes until I regret it with a shitstorm of ""You're a terrible person Drobit!""."
02-09-2018T00:06:42,unsteddyphoenix,This is where trace learns to tell apart keidran by theor breasts
02-09-2018T00:06:49,Bgrmystr2,haha phoenix maybe
02-09-2018T00:07:16,unsteddyphoenix,Thus leading to trace only being to distinguish flora cause of her chest
02-09-2018T00:07:29,unsteddyphoenix,It all comes together...
02-09-2018T00:08:28,Bgrmystr2,"poor flora.. She had no chance to think ""I wonder if Saria knows anything?"""
02-09-2018T00:08:33,Bgrmystr2,damn fairys
02-09-2018T00:11:52,Bgrmystr2,not sure if tom is lurking and taking notes? or.. started a conversation and noped out in the middle...
02-09-2018T00:14:08,Dadrobit,"First time Trace was introduced to Rose? I mean, I'd assume it'd be some point early on in his relationship with Saria."
02-09-2018T00:14:27,Dadrobit,"""By the way, Trace. I'd like you to meet my friend."" ""Saria! Stay back! There's a filthy keidran in your house!"" ""That's my friend... Rose."" ""Oh.... Nice to meet your Rose..."""
02-09-2018T00:14:32,Bgrmystr2,yeah that was the gist of it
02-09-2018T00:15:46,Bgrmystr2,"though yeah he wasn't like super evil at the time, so it was just.. a mild distrust / dislike / racism kinda deal"
02-09-2018T00:16:10,Bgrmystr2,so I dunno if he'd react with that much hostility
02-09-2018T00:16:37,Dadrobit,I'd think Trace would just suddenly flip the switch to make up for it to desperately try and stay on her good side.
02-09-2018T00:17:02,Dadrobit,"Eh going for the super hostile, to super faux friendly would be the funnier outcome."
02-09-2018T00:17:16,Bgrmystr2,"it is early in their relationship, so he's still young"
02-09-2018T00:20:28,Dadrobit,"Yeah, but Trace only having a mild reaction isn't as entertaining."
02-09-2018T00:21:03,unsteddyphoenix,"""You think keidran should be free, right?"" ""...I do now!"""
02-09-2018T00:21:22,Bgrmystr2,"well, this is a ""How did X happen"" so it's more of a lore question than a generic funny sunday sketch"
02-09-2018T00:21:30,unsteddyphoenix,"""Or i dont. Whatever the right answer is"""
02-09-2018T00:21:36,Bgrmystr2,haha
02-09-2018T00:22:00,Bgrmystr2,clearly trace is covering all his bases.
02-09-2018T00:22:43,Dadrobit,"I think that you are right, Saria!"" ""I haven't even said what I think yet..."""
02-09-2018T00:25:07,Bgrmystr2,"was just thinking about other things, and my mind went to walking in on rose in the bathroom after she took a shower or somethin"
02-09-2018T00:25:14,Bgrmystr2,hell of a way to meet someone new xD
02-09-2018T00:26:06,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-shock: *[""SARIA! THERE'S A LIVING MOP IN YOUR BATHROOM!!""]"
02-09-2018T00:26:50,Dadrobit,So I found this really cool video of the three masks having a conversation without their masks https://i.imgur.com/uinK0aH.gifv
02-09-2018T00:27:15,Twokinds,I can't believe you've done this
02-09-2018T00:27:20,Dadrobit,Lol
02-09-2018T00:27:38,Bgrmystr2,that 2nd and 4th comment..
02-09-2018T00:27:42,Bgrmystr2,ayy tom's back
02-09-2018T00:30:05,unsteddyphoenix,Oh my god
02-09-2018T00:30:21,Bgrmystr2,wb phoenix
02-09-2018T00:30:36,Dadrobit,The masks are less threatening than you might think.
02-09-2018T00:31:01,unsteddyphoenix,Idk i feel kinda threatened by that gif
02-09-2018T00:31:18,Dadrobit,"Uncomfortable, I get. Threatened?"
02-09-2018T00:33:29,unsteddyphoenix,Their tongues....
02-09-2018T00:34:00,Bgrmystr2,they turned towards us.
02-09-2018T00:34:03,Bgrmystr2,Do not want./
02-09-2018T00:37:04,Dadrobit,Viewcam from Nora getting their attention.
02-09-2018T00:49:09,unsteddyphoenix,No wonder ahe doesnt think much of them
02-09-2018T00:51:19,TheBeckoner,huh coulda gone without clicking on that link...
02-09-2018T00:53:38,Kinipshun,that link makes me feel very safe and comfortable
02-09-2018T00:53:44,Dadrobit,You're welcome.
02-09-2018T00:53:56,Kinipshun,thank you very much good sir
02-09-2018T00:56:02,Dadrobit,o7
02-09-2018T01:10:42,Vatruvius,Hello everyone! :ptv-greetings:
02-09-2018T01:11:04,Dadrobit,o/ Vat
02-09-2018T01:11:18,Bgrmystr2,hey vat
02-09-2018T01:11:32,Vatruvius,I have more developments of my web comic that I want to share/get input on.
02-09-2018T01:13:25,Vatruvius,"So, I guess if you want to listen and and give input Dadro I will welcome it but what I will talk about will kinda build off of what I have discussed before with Bgr and others."
02-09-2018T01:15:49,Vatruvius,"I got to thinking about the opening of my comic and how best to go about doing it. We discussed last time how having the first page or two be images of the scene, in this a case a futuristic cityscape, to set up the universe for the reader."
02-09-2018T01:15:59,Dadrobit,"Sure, if I see something I can have an opinion on. But I'm kind of here and not. Watching a Sound Design panel demo from Mick Gordon on another tab"
02-09-2018T01:16:53,Vatruvius,"I thought a great way to incorporate that with my story is to have these first two pages kinda follow the two main characters doing stuff in the city. Like, they will look just like other people in the city but if you pay attention you will notice them."
02-09-2018T01:17:07,Vatruvius,But these scenes will show a good portion of the scenery and the tone of the universe.
02-09-2018T01:39:14,Dadrobit,"As for editing, good luck mate. I took three years of audio editing in college to get my engineer certification, there's a whole lot to learn about editing SFX. Just try to get your hands on recordings that won't require you to do something silly like"
02-09-2018T01:39:53,Dadrobit,Whisper Fail and Dadrobit. Name a more iconic duo.
02-09-2018T01:45:42,Bgrmystr2,marty and doc :thinking:
02-09-2018T01:52:50,Vatruvius,"Yay, I have roughly planned out around the first 25 pages of my comic!"
02-09-2018T01:52:53,Vatruvius,Yes!
02-09-2018T01:55:42,Twokinds,Grats!
02-09-2018T01:56:17,Vatruvius,Thanks.
02-09-2018T01:56:44,Vatruvius,That page list is growing right now so...I predict future writers block when I need more pages.
02-09-2018T01:56:45,Vatruvius,XD
02-09-2018T02:10:09,Vatruvius,"Here is an interesting idea. So last time it seemed like a good idea to end the first chapter of my comic right at the bombshell moment. But that is way far out. So, what if I split the comic up into two types of sections: books and chapters?"
02-09-2018T02:10:57,Vatruvius,"A book would be a collection of chapters. So, the end of book 1 will be at the bombshell moment but the first chapter will end on day on of my comic as, now that I have it planned out, works out well as it is a bit of an introduction."
02-09-2018T02:11:23,Vatruvius,day one*
02-09-2018T02:20:36,Vatruvius,Reread what is my Chapter 1 and I like it. I think the whole book/chapter system will work well.
02-09-2018T02:28:22,DarthRexKing,Goodnight.
02-09-2018T02:29:03,Vatruvius,:ptv-greetings:
02-09-2018T02:32:20,Vatruvius,I suppose it is time to give Twokinds another read. Especially with all these ideas floating around in my head. Bye everyone!

02-09-2018T02:53:00,TheBeckoner,Taking a nap at 8pm really keeps you up...I think im getting tired tho

02-09-2018T11:38:29,CrimsonQuill,I want to write a webcomic.
02-09-2018T11:38:39,CrimsonQuill,But my drawing and writing skills are awful.
02-09-2018T11:38:53,CrimsonQuill,I can't come up with a decent storyline for the life of me.
02-09-2018T11:39:06,CrimsonQuill,"That, and I am inherently biased to manga."
02-09-2018T11:39:33,CrimsonQuill,"That said, something like 2000 AD's Charley's War'd be a good style,."

02-09-2018T13:48:57,Combak,Hi Tom!
02-09-2018T13:50:16,Mippy,I’m scared it might snow ❄️
02-09-2018T13:51:25,Mippy,Or at least a very cold rain 🌧
02-09-2018T13:51:28,Twokinds,Snow?
02-09-2018T13:51:31,Twokinds,Where is it snowing?
02-09-2018T13:51:46,Wooffin,It is not snowing even in finland. And we are part of nordics
02-09-2018T13:52:24,Mippy,It’s not snowing yet...but I’m afraid it might. It’s feels cold enough anyway.
02-09-2018T13:52:58,Mippy,Ah...it’s 8*C (47*F)
02-09-2018T13:53:33,Twokinds,It's 91 degrees here

02-09-2018T15:09:03,TerraTheWizard,"wait, dlc?!"
02-09-2018T15:09:09,CrimsonQuill,Arctic DLC
02-09-2018T15:09:31,TerraTheWizard,is it new story? or just a new biome?
02-09-2018T15:09:55,CrimsonQuill,"New biome, yes. Story-I don't know."
02-09-2018T15:09:59,TerraTheWizard,kay
02-09-2018T15:11:50,TorqueEmUp,"yeah, can't wait either"
02-09-2018T15:12:55,Wooffin,Myself never really picked interest onto such
02-09-2018T15:13:04,Wooffin,But I guess it could be  played through
02-09-2018T15:13:07,Combak,"Story too, supposedly."
02-09-2018T15:13:39,Combak,Play as a guy who's part of a mission that got sent back to the planet to observe it and recover tech from the aliens.
02-09-2018T15:13:58,CrimsonQuill,"@Twokinds Have you played Subnauseous, or just seen it? if you've played it....what was your favourite part?"
02-09-2018T15:15:15,Twokinds,Just the sense of exploration
02-09-2018T15:15:21,Twokinds,I went into it blind'
02-09-2018T15:15:27,Combak,Nice.
02-09-2018T15:15:39,Combak,Probably the best way to play.
02-09-2018T15:15:55,CrimsonQuill,Yeah...
02-09-2018T15:16:00,CrimsonQuill,I wish i'd done it blind.
02-09-2018T15:16:19,CrimsonQuill,But I had watched Mark and Jack's early access playthroughs...
02-09-2018T15:16:33,CrimsonQuill,"And when the full game came out, of course I watched the series."
02-09-2018T15:16:51,CrimsonQuill,Mark saying goodbye to Calvin was heartbreaking...Calvin the cuddlefish.
02-09-2018T15:17:03,CrimsonQuill,And Jack literally cried at the end of it.
02-09-2018T15:17:11,CrimsonQuill,So the story I know....
02-09-2018T15:17:23,CrimsonQuill,But it's still AWESOME.
02-09-2018T15:17:41,TerraTheWizard,shame they couldn't do multiplayer though
02-09-2018T15:17:48,CrimsonQuill,And I still have little idea as to where everything IS.
02-09-2018T15:17:51,CrimsonQuill,It's so big!
02-09-2018T15:17:55,Twokinds,I'm glad it wasn't multiplayer
02-09-2018T15:17:58,TorqueEmUp,^
02-09-2018T15:18:03,TorqueEmUp,Agreed
02-09-2018T15:18:05,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds So am I.
02-09-2018T15:18:17,CrimsonQuill,It would've made things wierd.
02-09-2018T15:18:17,Combak,"And then the guy I watched had built a huge tower by his launch spot, which showed that the entire end sequence was just images on the windows of the rocket."
02-09-2018T15:18:21,Bgrmystr2,it's not like multiplayer would have made it an mmo or anything
02-09-2018T15:18:34,TorqueEmUp,"Too many games anymore try to make the entire experience around multiplayer, and I hate that."
02-09-2018T15:18:46,Twokinds,There are so many early access open world survival crafting games
02-09-2018T15:18:51,Combak,A huge part of the game is the sense that the player is the SOLE survivor.
02-09-2018T15:19:01,Twokinds,It's just nice to have a solitary experience once in a while.
02-09-2018T15:19:07,TorqueEmUp,Like I don't have high hopes at all for Fallout 76
02-09-2018T15:19:19,CrimsonQuill,I don't know...I get very loney.
02-09-2018T15:19:20,TerraTheWizard,76 is gonna be baaad
02-09-2018T15:19:22,CrimsonQuill,lonely.
02-09-2018T15:19:25,TerraTheWizard,perks are from 'cards'
02-09-2018T15:19:32,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. multiplayer isn't mandatory. :thinking:
02-09-2018T15:19:36,Combak,That's kinda the idea Quill...
02-09-2018T15:19:38,Bgrmystr2,for most games
02-09-2018T15:19:49,CrimsonQuill,"I just feel scared by isolation,."
02-09-2018T15:19:55,CrimsonQuill,ESPECIALLY Alien isolation.
02-09-2018T15:19:59,Combak,Ha.
02-09-2018T15:20:07,Twokinds,"Sure, but multiplayer survival games are usually designed around the expectation"
02-09-2018T15:20:21,Twokinds,I wouldn't mind if multiplayer was added after the fact.
02-09-2018T15:20:23,TerraTheWizard,"anyway, the dev didn't put multiplayer in, because they said it would require a total rewrite of some major mechanics"
02-09-2018T15:20:36,CrimsonQuill,I'm glad Subnautica is single player.
02-09-2018T15:20:39,Bgrmystr2,"that's actually really bad coding-wise, tom"
02-09-2018T15:20:45,TerraTheWizard,also terrain deformation got taken out because it ate performance
02-09-2018T15:20:46,Combak,"Also, there's a sketch idea: Flora playing with a cuddlefish."
02-09-2018T15:21:07,CrimsonQuill,Or Jacksepticeye in his Seamoth washing up on the Basitin Islands...
02-09-2018T15:21:09,Combak,"Yeah, for Subnautica, they said they'd have to COMPLETELY redo the game to add multiplayer."
02-09-2018T15:21:14,CrimsonQuill,Or the Gianst Alien Gun!
02-09-2018T15:21:29,Bgrmystr2,"cuz if you don't plan your game for multiplayer until after you designed it for single player, you basically almost have to build the game all over again just to make it work with other people"
02-09-2018T15:21:35,Bgrmystr2,that's what TerraTech's problem is right now
02-09-2018T15:21:59,CrimsonQuill,I play Fortnite. My best friend tells me I'll have to learn fast to survive the pros in the game.
02-09-2018T15:22:08,TerraTheWizard,oh gods
02-09-2018T15:22:10,Bgrmystr2,"so if you plan to make it multiplayer, it should be planned and coded from the get-go,"
02-09-2018T15:22:12,TorqueEmUp,We just have too many multiplayer games period. We need more solo experiences.
02-09-2018T15:22:16,Combak,Oh you can just try to avoid everyone. XD
02-09-2018T15:22:24,TerraTheWizard,"fortnite is a game of ""who can build stairs fastest"""
02-09-2018T15:22:33,CrimsonQuill,It is very fun though.
02-09-2018T15:22:38,CrimsonQuill,I'm learning.
02-09-2018T15:22:39,Bgrmystr2,"and yeah, Torque, multiplayer isn't mandatory for vast majority"
02-09-2018T15:22:41,CrimsonQuill,Slowly.
02-09-2018T15:23:02,CrimsonQuill,Welp..I'll be playing subnauseous. Be back soon!
02-09-2018T15:23:15,Bgrmystr2,have fun lol
02-09-2018T15:23:21,Combak,https://i.redd.it/gu3ad0114mj11.jpg
02-09-2018T15:23:26,Combak,^ Terra
02-09-2018T15:24:08,TerraTheWizard,lol
02-09-2018T15:24:32,TerraTheWizard,"this is a reason i prefer pubg, no building"
02-09-2018T15:24:40,MidNightBlue78,subnauseous???
02-09-2018T15:25:00,TerraTheWizard,"and before anyone goes off on a ""that game's so buggy reeeeee"", i've not had really any issues with it"
02-09-2018T15:25:00,TorqueEmUp,Meh Battle Royale needs to die already. lol
02-09-2018T15:25:12,Bgrmystr2,"if I wanted to build stuff, I'd jump on minecraft or play sim city. If I wanted a shooter game, I'd play Borderlands or Halo."
02-09-2018T15:25:28,TerraTheWizard,i need to play some arma3 again
02-09-2018T15:25:44,Bgrmystr2,I'm kinda ehh about building in a shooter game
02-09-2018T15:26:09,TorqueEmUp,That's the biggest reason I find Fortnite to be crap
02-09-2018T15:26:17,Bgrmystr2,it just draws me away from the belivability honestly
02-09-2018T15:26:56,Combak,Building DESTRUCTION wouldn't... But that's Battlefield.
02-09-2018T15:27:03,TorqueEmUp,I just don't like the fact you can immediately build a wall in front of yourself to block the bullets.
02-09-2018T15:27:51,Bgrmystr2,"it's wood, it wouldn't block bullets anyway, and it takes more than a second to make a wooden wall anyway so I mean"
02-09-2018T15:27:54,Bgrmystr2,it lost me from the get-go
02-09-2018T15:29:56,TorqueEmUp,I just don't play as many games as I used to.
02-09-2018T15:30:13,TorqueEmUp,and anything new makes me want to shake my fist like an old man.
02-09-2018T15:30:45,TorqueEmUp,gosh dern kids and their fortnuts!
02-09-2018T15:31:05,TerraTheWizard,"though speaking of games coming soon, i'm excited for this one https://goose.game/"
02-09-2018T15:32:11,Wooffin,Myself mainly waiting tales of vesperia remake and doom eternal
02-09-2018T15:40:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Waiting for Devil may cry 5, my self"
02-09-2018T15:43:13,Bgrmystr2,lol Terra that's just like uh.. Goat Simulator lol
02-09-2018T15:43:24,Bgrmystr2,"be a goat, cause mayhem"
02-09-2018T15:43:27,Bgrmystr2,prettymuch
02-09-2018T15:45:25,Wooffin,And I guess following what devolver does
02-09-2018T15:45:28,TerraTheWizard,"well, goat sim was about being buggy for the sake of being  buggy"
02-09-2018T15:45:30,Wooffin,As it is one freaky company
02-09-2018T15:45:48,Bgrmystr2,"it wasn't just about being buggy, it was about causing problems for ppl too"
02-09-2018T15:46:02,Bgrmystr2,it was a lot of things lol
02-09-2018T15:47:00,CrimsonQuill,I'm back
02-09-2018T15:47:03,ThingsAreMoving,o/
02-09-2018T15:48:09,Wooffin,How dark is your coffee?
02-09-2018T15:49:10,ThingsAreMoving,"Medium-dark roast, 23g coffee grounds per 550ml of water. Pretty dark and strong, but not bitter."
02-09-2018T15:49:44,ThingsAreMoving,coffee - srs bzns
02-09-2018T15:49:56,CrimsonQuill,I dislike coffee.
02-09-2018T15:50:08,CrimsonQuill,I prefer tea.
02-09-2018T15:50:10,Wooffin,Heh nice things
02-09-2018T15:50:14,Wooffin,And okays crimson
02-09-2018T15:50:16,CrimsonQuill,Especially Earl Grey
02-09-2018T15:50:22,Wooffin,Myself I had my coffee like I habe it always
02-09-2018T15:50:32,Wooffin,No milk no sugar and normal routine of the day
02-09-2018T15:50:48,CrimsonQuill,Tea. Twinings is preferred.
02-09-2018T15:50:56,ThingsAreMoving,"I like tea, but my stomach can't handle it for some reason. If I were to drink tea that was steeping for more than 10 seconds I'd get a bad case of nausea"
02-09-2018T15:50:58,CrimsonQuill,With a splash of milk.
02-09-2018T15:51:06,CrimsonQuill,And a biscuit
02-09-2018T15:51:21,CrimsonQuill,My grandad on Mummy;s side used to drink 7 cups a day
02-09-2018T15:51:58,Wooffin,I used to drink 3 pots per day
02-09-2018T15:52:02,Wooffin,Like coffee
02-09-2018T15:52:06,CrimsonQuill,I love it
02-09-2018T15:52:10,CrimsonQuill,Tea that is
02-09-2018T15:52:24,CrimsonQuill,I think I'll head off for now though.
02-09-2018T15:52:28,Wooffin,Amateur to landen but I was having it pulling me through vocational
02-09-2018T15:52:32,CrimsonQuill,Goodnight all!
02-09-2018T15:52:51,ThingsAreMoving,cya Quill

02-09-2018T15:53:53,Wooffin,Or prefer to just eye at stream incase tom tom is feeling like streaming?
02-09-2018T15:54:04,ThingsAreMoving,the latter
02-09-2018T15:54:09,Wooffin,Heh okays
02-09-2018T15:54:13,Bgrmystr2,the latter for me as well.
02-09-2018T15:54:20,ThingsAreMoving,I'm focused on my after work dinner pretty much
02-09-2018T15:54:24,Bgrmystr2,"Lotta ppl here, professional lurkers"
02-09-2018T15:54:35,Wooffin,Be safe and lets hold thumbies up that tom toms hand and wrist is fine when he feels like drawing for fans ^^

02-09-2018T15:59:00,Dadrobit,Sister is trying to convince me to take care of my neice for the day and help her with her homework so that she can have an easier day off.
02-09-2018T15:59:08,Dadrobit,Fat. Fucking. Chance.
02-09-2018T16:00:23,Dadrobit,"As much as I enjoy reading The Most Dangerous Game, I'm sick as a dog, and assisting in 8th grade homework is the last thing I want to be doing right now."
02-09-2018T16:09:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Anyone know if Tom died last night or is he better
02-09-2018T16:09:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, what could ~possibly~ be so scary about 8th grade homework"
02-09-2018T16:19:01,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"8th graders are scary, also I hope Tom is alive.  if he resurrects tomorrow I'm gonna end up missing it"
02-09-2018T16:23:56,Miftox01,they are mostly disrepectful in my school...
02-09-2018T16:24:13,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. they are kids so
02-09-2018T16:24:25,Miftox01,yeah but still
02-09-2018T16:25:05,Miftox01,at least apologize if you hit an older student with your basketball... just sayin`
02-09-2018T16:25:41,Bgrmystr2,oh they're lil shits for the most part
02-09-2018T16:25:45,Bgrmystr2,yep
02-09-2018T16:25:59,Miftox01,ofcourse I don`t want to generalize
02-09-2018T16:26:13,Bgrmystr2,"it's ok, I will so you don't have to. :V"
02-09-2018T16:26:26,Bgrmystr2,they're not all bad
02-09-2018T16:26:32,Bgrmystr2,but a lot of em.. yeah
02-09-2018T16:26:36,Miftox01,:D
02-09-2018T16:26:47,Bgrmystr2,comes with the territory
02-09-2018T16:27:09,Miftox01,well at least I`m almost out of there
02-09-2018T16:27:25,Miftox01,just this last year
02-09-2018T16:27:31,Bgrmystr2,godspeed. I've been out of there for more than a decade
02-09-2018T16:27:54,Miftox01,how lucky you are
02-09-2018T16:27:59,Bgrmystr2,eh
02-09-2018T16:28:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'v been set free about 4 years ago....
02-09-2018T16:28:25,Miftox01,what did you do afterwards? If you want to share...
02-09-2018T16:28:48,Bgrmystr2,"post-highschool, computer tech jobs for the most part"
02-09-2018T16:29:02,Bgrmystr2,"market is pretty bad here, and the colleges are worse"
02-09-2018T16:29:19,Bgrmystr2,so it's been.. not great. :v
02-09-2018T16:29:25,Bgrmystr2,could be worse though
02-09-2018T16:29:48,Miftox01,as long as you don`t regret anything ;)
02-09-2018T16:30:17,Bgrmystr2,"oh naw I regret nothing. I've done some stupid shit in the past, but if I hadn't done that, I wouldn't have learned not to do it"
02-09-2018T16:30:36,ferociousfox,Happy regrets
02-09-2018T16:30:38,Miftox01,I want to study so that I can become an engineer
02-09-2018T16:30:40,Bgrmystr2,"so.. most ppl would regret doing that.. Yeah I prolly would too, but yeah."
02-09-2018T16:31:00,Bgrmystr2,"If I regretted doing it, I wouldn't have done it and wouldn't have learned"
02-09-2018T16:31:06,Bgrmystr2,so eh.. life. :u
02-09-2018T16:31:20,Miftox01,good advice :)
02-09-2018T16:32:45,Miftox01,well gotta go to sleep again. C u soon
02-09-2018T16:47:10,CommanderTrace,hello whats up?
02-09-2018T16:48:05,Combak,We're just hanging around in case Tom streams this evening.
02-09-2018T16:51:33,ferociousfox,curry :ptv-angry:
02-09-2018T16:51:38,ferociousfox,twas too good
02-09-2018T17:01:41,Mippy,"Ugh! Within my first three hours of work I spilled water on the floor, double brewed a pot of coffee, and broke a coffee pot. It is not my day."
02-09-2018T17:09:34,Mippy,However...I did receive an email that a eyeshadow palette I’ve been wanting was $10 off. Good thing I only have to eat out once before payday because I’m broke now.
02-09-2018T17:12:38,Mippy,Ok bye again
02-09-2018T17:42:44,SpazztasticKiwi,My favorite palette is the ultimate unicorn glitter eyeshadow I saw at Walmart once. I’m pretty sure it’s urban decay and it’s got to be the most glitter I’ve seen in makeup in my life
02-09-2018T17:44:20,MidNightBlue78,"i rarely use eye makeup, my real weakness is lipstick and nail polish"
02-09-2018T17:53:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I love me a good shadow and liner
02-09-2018T17:54:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Mascara too. Waterproof fiber
02-09-2018T17:57:36,MidNightBlue78,the reason i don't use it is because i always forget i have eye makeup on and I rub my eyes lol
02-09-2018T18:00:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don’t wear it often because it’s too much effort but when I do, I smudge it because I forget about it"
02-09-2018T18:40:20,Combak,So...
02-09-2018T18:43:40,Wooffin,Coffee?
02-09-2018T18:47:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-natanisleep:
02-09-2018T18:47:19,Wooffin,Marv get some java :p
02-09-2018T18:48:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I don't drink coffee
02-09-2018T18:48:39,Wooffin,Oh right
02-09-2018T18:48:42,Wooffin,Excuse me I forgot
02-09-2018T18:48:55,Wooffin,Maybe some tea or go for a quick exercise?
02-09-2018T18:49:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"nah, just gonna watch w0lfymare and blast some Danza Kuduro"
02-09-2018T18:49:47,Wooffin,Oh okays. Well goodluck with that ^^
02-09-2018T18:49:56,Wooffin,And please don't fall sleep on´to keyboard
02-09-2018T18:50:07,Wooffin,Your neck will be a mess on waking up otherwise
02-09-2018T18:50:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"thats my secret, my neck is always messed up :sunglasses:"

02-09-2018T19:06:25,TorqueEmUp,Just glad I didn't waste my day waiting.
02-09-2018T19:06:43,Bgrmystr2,So I guess I can put another one in the jar then?

02-09-2018T19:52:10,Combak,"TBH, I'd kinda prefer it if Tom just picked them all and didn't stream it."
02-09-2018T19:52:31,Foxpie,he can always stream at the heat death of the universe
02-09-2018T19:52:36,Bgrmystr2,or.. he could just pick them and stream anyway
02-09-2018T19:52:41,Combak,It's always cool to see which ones Tom picks.
02-09-2018T19:52:49,Bgrmystr2,streaming doesn't mean he can't pick stuff
02-09-2018T19:52:55,Combak,But then I'll want to watch it! :p

02-09-2018T20:46:43,BluePhantom90,I figure you took the advice for doing side comics and just post them without color
02-09-2018T20:46:43,CrRAR,haha
02-09-2018T20:46:44,CatzArt,cool

02-09-2018T20:47:16,boiguy123,lol
02-09-2018T20:47:31,Twokinds,Well I'm sure I'll go back and color them eventually
02-09-2018T20:47:42,Twokinds,But for now they're sketches
02-09-2018T20:47:48,boiguy123,The key word is eventually
02-09-2018T20:47:48,BluePhantom90,I say just keep them like that.
02-09-2018T20:48:04,Combak,Cool beans.
02-09-2018T20:48:19,Twokinds,Doing sketch side comics is a lot faster than doing color comics
02-09-2018T20:48:21,Twokinds,That's for sure
02-09-2018T20:48:24,Combak,"And in the mean time, fan colorings!"
02-09-2018T20:48:31,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, color is nice to have, Blue. So just color them when you have time, Tom :)"
02-09-2018T20:48:37,unsteddyphoenix,That's true!
02-09-2018T20:48:40,BluePhantom90,lol yeah there you go. Let the fans color them
02-09-2018T20:48:48,Corinthian,"Yeah, that'll have time"
02-09-2018T20:48:49,CrRAR,Sketches surely have their own charm
02-09-2018T20:48:52,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
02-09-2018T20:48:52,Combak,... I'm pretty sure that's a true-ism Tom.
02-09-2018T20:48:53,InTheLionsDen,Paint by numbers
02-09-2018T20:48:58,unsteddyphoenix,It would be good practise?
02-09-2018T20:49:11,Bgrmystr2,"I mean.. fan colors aren't that great, @Blue"
02-09-2018T20:49:15,Bgrmystr2,but yknow
02-09-2018T20:49:20,Bgrmystr2,:u
02-09-2018T20:49:20,MisterWho,@blue fans colored - that might get...interesting chaotic XD
02-09-2018T20:49:28,qwe304,i like the sketch aesthetic tbh
02-09-2018T20:49:50,MisterWho,sketch lineart can sometimes also looks way better than colored.
02-09-2018T20:50:01,MisterWho,depends on the art
02-09-2018T20:50:03,boiguy123,True
02-09-2018T20:50:06,BluePhantom90,lol But that is the fun part with Fans. Some get them right som can get them wrong.
02-09-2018T20:50:15,MisterWho,indeed
02-09-2018T20:50:35,Bgrmystr2,"I guess I just haven't seen any ""right""s then xD"

02-09-2018T20:51:05,Combak,"Woah, triple vision!"
02-09-2018T20:51:09,Bgrmystr2,I've seen a lot lol
02-09-2018T20:51:25,MisterWho,time to hunt fanart i guess. :D

02-09-2018T22:11:30,TheFDdriver,Better watch out Maddie
02-09-2018T22:11:32,MallardDuckAvia,What happened to the Maddie telling sythe to respect his elders
02-09-2018T22:11:40,Tharkis,now we need a Karen earwiggle! :ctharkis-earwiggle:
02-09-2018T22:11:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yes
02-09-2018T22:12:28,TheFDdriver,swag'y ears????
02-09-2018T22:12:43,CrRAR,"Maddie: ""My ears are not for YOUR ENJOYMENT!"""
02-09-2018T22:12:58,TheFDdriver,XD
02-09-2018T22:13:07,MallardDuckAvia,Hey tom. You need to add We are Number One to the song list to respect Robbie Rottens passing
02-09-2018T22:13:31,MallardDuckAvia,Wait is this a sketch stream now?
02-09-2018T22:14:01,Bgrmystr2,don't think so
02-09-2018T22:14:12,MallardDuckAvia,So this is part of the comic
02-09-2018T22:14:31,Bgrmystr2,"I think this is part of side comic, but it's something that's not spoiler-y"
02-09-2018T22:14:55,MallardDuckAvia,But Karen’s wearing different shirts now so maybe not
02-09-2018T22:15:16,MallardDuckAvia,And this doesn’t fit in with the side comic much
02-09-2018T22:15:24,CrRAR,This is an expansion on the ear saga.
02-09-2018T22:15:29,MallardDuckAvia,See the cloths changed
02-09-2018T22:15:30,CrRAR,obvs
02-09-2018T22:15:35,HeresyArtStream,"So, who else here pre-ordered the physical edition of Dust?"
02-09-2018T22:15:45,MallardDuckAvia,So this is a sketch stream now I guess
02-09-2018T22:16:12,Mippy,I did not know there was one Heresy
02-09-2018T22:16:14,CrRAR,sketches happening [✓✓✓]
02-09-2018T22:16:25,unsteddyphoenix,technically correct
02-09-2018T22:16:26,HeresyArtStream,It's on Limited Run Games (for Nintendo Switch)
02-09-2018T22:16:34,TheFDdriver,Noice
02-09-2018T22:16:47,TheFDdriver,i would get it..
02-09-2018T22:16:58,Mippy,"Well, I don’t have a switch so that would be pointless"
02-09-2018T22:17:00,TheFDdriver,but i dont have next gen...
02-09-2018T22:17:01,Bgrmystr2,"Mallard, just cuz you can run around the point doesn't mean you're correct lol"
02-09-2018T22:17:09,HeresyArtStream,Limited Run seems to have made a lot of improvements. It used to be that you had to camp out on their website because everything would sell out in a few minutes when they did pre-orders.
02-09-2018T22:17:24,HeresyArtStream,This is the first time I've pre-ordered anything from them.
