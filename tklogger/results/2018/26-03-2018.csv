26-03-2018T00:03:32,Bigboi182,Damn
26-03-2018T00:03:59,Dadrobit,She started when she was 15 with a tiny green band around her left wrist.
26-03-2018T00:04:08,Dadrobit,Then she turned it into a vine
26-03-2018T00:04:17,Dadrobit,And the vine has grown throuhgout her life.
26-03-2018T00:04:28,Bigboi182,Wow.

26-03-2018T00:04:54,unsteddyphoenix,Your grandma only gets cooler the more I hear about her
26-03-2018T00:05:18,Dadrobit,She's actually the bestest.
26-03-2018T00:05:49,Dadrobit,It is my goal to be at least half as cool as she is by the time I die.
26-03-2018T00:06:22,unsteddyphoenix,which means you need half the tats
26-03-2018T00:06:33,Bigboi182,maybe...
26-03-2018T00:07:16,Dadrobit,:( But I don't want tats...
26-03-2018T00:07:36,unsteddyphoenix,you dont have a choice at this point
26-03-2018T00:07:40,unsteddyphoenix,The legacy...
26-03-2018T00:14:33,Bigboi182,It must be followed...
26-03-2018T00:14:54,TheBeckoner,My Grandma is insane. So I hope to not be insane...yea
26-03-2018T00:15:52,Bigboi182,that's a legacy that you SHOULDN'T follow beck...
26-03-2018T00:16:19,TheBeckoner,I agree lol
26-03-2018T00:16:39,Bigboi182,Stay as far away from that as you can.
26-03-2018T00:16:44,TheBeckoner,Most of my older relatives are a bit nuts
26-03-2018T00:16:46,TheBeckoner,and we try
26-03-2018T00:16:58,Bigboi182,Just don't let them notice...

26-03-2018T18:20:04,WIPKING,might stream
26-03-2018T18:20:09,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:

26-03-2018T20:16:32,Bigboi182,"Jeez, do I just show up at the wrong times or something?"
26-03-2018T20:54:32,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: not really
26-03-2018T20:54:53,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I guess you could look at it that way"
26-03-2018T20:55:41,Bgrmystr2,"depends on whether you want to come by and find people, or find peace and quiet"
26-03-2018T21:01:03,Bigboi182,I don't come here for peace and  quiet.
26-03-2018T21:01:17,Bigboi182,"If I wanted that, I would sleep."
26-03-2018T21:03:36,Bigboi182,Which I will do right now.
26-03-2018T21:04:10,Bigboi182,Because everyone else is probably doing that anyway...
26-03-2018T21:04:17,Bigboi182,So... yeah.
26-03-2018T21:04:20,Bigboi182,Bye!
26-03-2018T21:05:00,Bgrmystr2,"okay then, seeya later ;o"
26-03-2018T21:05:25,Twokinds,Time to start streaming!
26-03-2018T21:06:15,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
26-03-2018T21:06:23,unsteddyphoenix,I dare you~
26-03-2018T21:06:37,Bgrmystr2,"He would, phoenix"
26-03-2018T21:06:41,Bgrmystr2,xD
26-03-2018T21:10:16,Twokinds,"Can't, solving puzzles"
26-03-2018T21:10:42,unsteddyphoenix,You're right that takes priority.
26-03-2018T21:13:15,Bgrmystr2,":thumbsup: s'ok tom, you do you"
26-03-2018T21:21:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Puzzles are addicting: “just one more”
26-03-2018T21:22:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Or are you trying to solve the puzzle of life
26-03-2018T21:24:00,unsteddyphoenix,That one's not great. Just play tetris
26-03-2018T21:37:41,TheBeckoner,"I do like tetris, im pretty decent at it too"
26-03-2018T21:40:45,Twokinds,Life is a game of tetris
26-03-2018T21:41:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Accurate
26-03-2018T21:41:17,Twokinds,Things are fine for a while then problems pile up until you die.
26-03-2018T21:41:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Well
26-03-2018T21:41:34,SpazztasticKiwi,you’re a ball of sunshine today
26-03-2018T21:41:58,Twokinds,:ptv-laugh:
26-03-2018T21:42:04,Bgrmystr2,hahaha
26-03-2018T21:42:07,unsteddyphoenix,Youre completely on top of things until  you make a few small mistakes and everything spirals out of control
26-03-2018T21:42:18,unsteddyphoenix,Actually pretty apt :thinking:
26-03-2018T21:42:25,Twokinds,But I'm really good at tetris so life's great.
26-03-2018T21:43:03,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah if you never mess up in tetris you'll never die
26-03-2018T21:43:06,unsteddyphoenix,Just like real life
26-03-2018T21:43:12,Twokinds,That's the plan
26-03-2018T21:43:37,unsteddyphoenix,Hey not bad
26-03-2018T21:43:49,TheBeckoner,Decent at life = decent at tetris?
26-03-2018T21:43:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"What does it mean though that, when you play Tetris, the lines disappear at the end because you match them"
26-03-2018T21:43:55,TheBeckoner,I think Im better at tetris than life
26-03-2018T21:44:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Is that analogy for the years of your life disappearing
26-03-2018T21:44:51,unsteddyphoenix,I am now playing tetris
26-03-2018T21:45:14,unsteddyphoenix,"did tetris always have a ""hold block"" mechanic that makes it so much easier."
26-03-2018T21:45:30,TheBeckoner,Let us know how many line yah get
26-03-2018T21:45:58,SpazztasticKiwi,By the way I took my grandma for her surgery this morning - the doctor was concerned about my age because I was the driver and looked awful young
26-03-2018T21:46:07,Twokinds,I've never heard of a hold block mechanic.
26-03-2018T21:46:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Hold block mechanic is a blessing
26-03-2018T21:46:51,TheBeckoner,What is it?
26-03-2018T21:47:13,SpazztasticKiwi,You can choose to put a block aside for later and jump to the next
26-03-2018T21:47:25,TheBeckoner,booo
26-03-2018T21:47:32,TheBeckoner,Original is best imo
26-03-2018T21:47:43,TheBeckoner,Makes things hard
26-03-2018T21:47:47,TheBeckoner,ish
26-03-2018T21:48:33,Bgrmystr2,that defeats the purpose of Tetris
26-03-2018T21:48:43,Bgrmystr2,the whole idea was making the best of the blocks you have
26-03-2018T21:48:47,Bgrmystr2,._.
26-03-2018T21:57:44,SpazztasticKiwi,How about temple run
26-03-2018T22:02:13,unsteddyphoenix,Wew that was an intense tetris game
26-03-2018T22:02:41,unsteddyphoenix,I came back from the final line
26-03-2018T22:02:54,unsteddyphoenix,Dont think ive done that before
26-03-2018T22:12:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m looking at some of my old pictures that cloud just loaded
26-03-2018T22:12:17,SpazztasticKiwi,And it’s kinda golden
26-03-2018T22:15:54,unsteddyphoenix,How so? You gon' share?
26-03-2018T22:17:41,SpazztasticKiwi,“I replaced the air freshener in the work break room with an air horn. Now we wait”
26-03-2018T22:18:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"Despite the cost of living, it’s still popular"
26-03-2018T22:18:45,SpazztasticKiwi,And a few pictures of Kiwi with her teddy bear loaded
26-03-2018T22:19:02,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:
26-03-2018T22:19:07,Bgrmystr2,xD how do you replace the air freshener with an air horn and expect noone to notice
26-03-2018T22:20:30,SpazztasticKiwi,You’d be surprised at how unobservant some people are
26-03-2018T22:21:47,Bgrmystr2,yeah but.. they look completely different
26-03-2018T22:22:19,Bgrmystr2,that's like trying to replace someone's car in their driveway with a truck of the same color and see if they notice
26-03-2018T22:22:43,Bgrmystr2,you'd have to be like.. PRETTY out there to not notice something like that
26-03-2018T22:23:44,unsteddyphoenix,:bear::smiley_cat::question:
26-03-2018T22:24:40,SpazztasticKiwi,She has a small teddy bear that she sleeps with sometimes

26-03-2018T22:27:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I was just looking at my pictures on it. It’s trying to update cloud
26-03-2018T22:28:01,SpazztasticKiwi,But it can’t because of no connection
26-03-2018T22:31:36,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-katwet:
26-03-2018T22:39:45,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all.
26-03-2018T22:40:41,unsteddyphoenix,hi daddy
26-03-2018T22:41:18,TheBeckoner,Hullo Robit
26-03-2018T23:04:40,Dadrobit,:( I think my phone needs a new battery
26-03-2018T23:05:11,Twokinds,Replaceable batteries are pretty cheap.
26-03-2018T23:06:17,Dadrobit,"Yeah, about 30 bucks or so, not terrible."
26-03-2018T23:06:25,Dadrobit,But I'm laaaaazyyyyyy.
26-03-2018T23:06:41,unsteddyphoenix,How long have you had your phone
26-03-2018T23:06:49,Twokinds,30 bucks? jeez
26-03-2018T23:06:57,Dadrobit,Almost 2 years?
26-03-2018T23:07:30,Twokinds,I replaced my phone's battery last December and it was 13.99
26-03-2018T23:07:51,unsteddyphoenix,That's not long at all...
26-03-2018T23:08:02,unsteddyphoenix,What model is it so I can avoid it~
26-03-2018T23:08:16,Dadrobit,"Lol, Droid Turbo 2."
26-03-2018T23:08:27,Dadrobit,"To be fair, it's seen some pretty heavy use."
26-03-2018T23:08:40,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds like an anime finishing move
26-03-2018T23:08:55,Dadrobit,Those 12 hour shifts in security weren't going to pass themselves.
26-03-2018T23:09:26,unsteddyphoenix,"fair, i barely ever use my phone."
26-03-2018T23:09:31,unsteddyphoenix,Im a fraud of a millenial
26-03-2018T23:09:46,Twokinds,Eh my phone's batter only lasted about 2 years before it became noticable short
26-03-2018T23:10:13,unsteddyphoenix,huh. Guess i've just gotten lucky.
26-03-2018T23:10:23,Dadrobit,"It still lasts a full day with moderate use, but nowhere near where it used to be."
26-03-2018T23:12:44,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe its facebook recording your browsing habits. :O
26-03-2018T23:13:04,Dadrobit,I'm not on FaceBook though.
26-03-2018T23:13:22,unsteddyphoenix,Thats what YOU think
26-03-2018T23:14:01,Dadrobit,"Okay, that was a lie, every once in a blue moon someone will tag me in something and I'll be forced to look at it."
26-03-2018T23:14:11,Dadrobit,But I haven't posted anything in years.
26-03-2018T23:14:31,unsteddyphoenix,Neither. I just use it to chat sometimes and respond to events.
26-03-2018T23:14:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"What kind of phone you got, Tom? Cause that doesn’t sound like an iPhone for sure"
26-03-2018T23:15:08,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah an iphone would be broken after two years~
26-03-2018T23:15:19,Dadrobit,months*
26-03-2018T23:15:27,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-clovischuckle:
26-03-2018T23:15:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Mines been fabulous for a year
26-03-2018T23:16:21,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s qualified for an upgrade I believe but I don’t particularly want the 8 or X
26-03-2018T23:17:06,Twokinds,I have a Note 4
26-03-2018T23:17:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Those are pretty cool
26-03-2018T23:18:06,Twokinds,I like it
26-03-2018T23:19:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve heard they’re pretty reliable too. I’ve dropped my phone so many times I swear it’s a stick of butter
26-03-2018T23:19:17,SpazztasticKiwi,But it ain’t dead or even cracked
26-03-2018T23:20:07,TheBeckoner,Mmm I have  a Turbo 2. I have noticed a lack of the battery lasting. Probably a side effect of the turbo charge feature
26-03-2018T23:20:35,unsteddyphoenix,"theres a ""turbo charge"" feature?"
26-03-2018T23:20:41,unsteddyphoenix,I take it back I want this phone
26-03-2018T23:20:44,SpazztasticKiwi,My brain just immediately imagined a phone with a mini rocket
26-03-2018T23:20:48,unsteddyphoenix,that sounds badass
26-03-2018T23:21:16,Dadrobit,"I'm pretty sure I have an upgrade available if I just want a new phone, but tbh I'm afraid something new won't be as good."
26-03-2018T23:21:22,SpazztasticKiwi,The 8 and X is supposed to have wireless charging don’t they
26-03-2018T23:21:36,Twokinds,I'm pretty sure I'll have my Note for many years. It's all I really need.
26-03-2018T23:21:45,TheBeckoner,It just charges the battery super fast
26-03-2018T23:22:17,Dadrobit,"I always have a million things running on my phone, and it works flawlessly, and then I hear about other phones locking up if you have more than 20 tabs open."
26-03-2018T23:22:36,unsteddyphoenix,if it aint broke...
26-03-2018T23:22:38,Dadrobit,Don't wanna deal w/ that.
26-03-2018T23:22:44,Dadrobit,Exactly.
26-03-2018T23:22:46,SpazztasticKiwi,You have struck me as a person who’s picky Tom
26-03-2018T23:22:54,SpazztasticKiwi,*not picky
26-03-2018T23:23:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Voice dictation hates me
26-03-2018T23:23:40,unsteddyphoenix,Everyones picky about some things
26-03-2018T23:24:25,Twokinds,I'm very picky about the things I'm picky about.
26-03-2018T23:24:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Imagine that
26-03-2018T23:25:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Is it possible to be too low maintenance
26-03-2018T23:26:02,Dadrobit,Yes
26-03-2018T23:26:47,unsteddyphoenix,Probably
26-03-2018T23:26:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I know people like that
26-03-2018T23:27:04,unsteddyphoenix,Actually I listened to a talk about that
26-03-2018T23:28:20,unsteddyphoenix,"It basically boiled down to if someone in a relationship is too agreeable, the relationship is just as doomed as one where two people argue all the time."
26-03-2018T23:28:40,TheBeckoner,So a yes person?
26-03-2018T23:28:59,unsteddyphoenix,More or less.
26-03-2018T23:29:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m talking more about the “What do you want for lunch”/“I don’t care” thing
26-03-2018T23:29:39,Dadrobit,Pickiness is just conceptualization of a person's ideologies. Someone without any pickiness speaks to me of a vacuous personality.
26-03-2018T23:30:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Using the fancy words tonight huh
26-03-2018T23:30:28,Bgrmystr2,indeed
26-03-2018T23:30:54,unsteddyphoenix,I'd put in down to just someone who's dehibilitatingly meek
26-03-2018T23:31:05,unsteddyphoenix,I can do it too!
26-03-2018T23:31:09,Dadrobit,So fancy~~
26-03-2018T23:31:16,unsteddyphoenix,(If I misspelt it dont correct me)
26-03-2018T23:31:43,Dadrobit,You're lucky Serp isn't here anymore lol
26-03-2018T23:32:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not necessarily picky about stuff. I do have preferences though
26-03-2018T23:32:11,Bgrmystr2,debilitatingly (in b4 vibrating flora) :ptv-snicker:
26-03-2018T23:32:34,TheBeckoner,lol
26-03-2018T23:32:43,unsteddyphoenix,Ive been sayng it wrong all this time :thinking:
26-03-2018T23:32:57,Bgrmystr2,it was the first result upon searching for what you said
26-03-2018T23:33:06,Bgrmystr2,"apparently, the internet doesn't know what you meant either"
26-03-2018T23:33:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t worry. I had an adventure learning “Fischbach”
26-03-2018T23:33:48,unsteddyphoenix,What is that name anyway. German?
26-03-2018T23:34:02,Twokinds,Ja
26-03-2018T23:34:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I see what you did there
26-03-2018T23:34:40,unsteddyphoenix,Interesting lineage
26-03-2018T23:34:47,unsteddyphoenix,"Though, I cant talk."
26-03-2018T23:35:44,unsteddyphoenix,Theres another layer of difficulty meeting new people when your name is weird.
26-03-2018T23:35:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Fun fact: “fisch” means fish in German and “bach” means creek in German
26-03-2018T23:36:18,unsteddyphoenix,Huh. Up Fischbach without a paddle.
26-03-2018T23:36:33,unsteddyphoenix,Now tell me what Toms korean name means.
26-03-2018T23:36:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah that’s the thing there has to be a space in between them otherwise it doesn’t translate
26-03-2018T23:37:22,Dadrobit,"As someone with a Russian name, can confirm, the first conversation meeting anyone new is always about how to pronounce the name right."
26-03-2018T23:37:42,Dadrobit,long Russian*
26-03-2018T23:37:49,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah.
26-03-2018T23:38:28,TheBeckoner,hah people have made my name out to be some crazy stuff. Its really not that hard of a name.
26-03-2018T23:38:34,TheBeckoner,uncommon maybe.
26-03-2018T23:38:46,unsteddyphoenix,Both my first and last name is italian
26-03-2018T23:38:59,unsteddyphoenix,"And giving my name to like, people behind desks is the worst"
26-03-2018T23:39:14,Twokinds,I didn't realize unsteddy was italian.
26-03-2018T23:39:26,unsteddyphoenix,Very unique dialect
26-03-2018T23:39:38,Twokinds,Or phoenix for that matter.
26-03-2018T23:39:44,Dadrobit,Lol
26-03-2018T23:39:45,SpazztasticKiwi,My first and middle name is Hebrew
26-03-2018T23:40:09,Dadrobit,Gotta always spell out the name. Every single time.
26-03-2018T23:40:27,Dadrobit,Always use words for the commonly misheard letters
26-03-2018T23:40:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"My last has been claimed as both German and Scottish, so I’m not so sure about that one"
26-03-2018T23:40:46,unsteddyphoenix,Well you should've known that one. Never heard of the firebird of frankeforte?
26-03-2018T23:40:51,unsteddyphoenix,Classic tale
26-03-2018T23:41:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"unsteddy, I just read back on some stuff"
26-03-2018T23:41:12,unsteddyphoenix,Daddy you know~
26-03-2018T23:41:27,SpazztasticKiwi,What do you mean about Tom’s Korean name
26-03-2018T23:41:50,SpazztasticKiwi,cause you lost me
26-03-2018T23:41:51,unsteddyphoenix,Dont korean names sometimes mean stuff
26-03-2018T23:42:05,unsteddyphoenix,"My friends apparently roughly translates to ""Summer Forest"""
26-03-2018T23:43:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t know what you would be referring to
26-03-2018T23:43:20,unsteddyphoenix,Youve let me down on this one. I'll forgive you though.
26-03-2018T23:43:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Besides I’m learning German not Korean I wouldn’t be able to tell you even if I knew what it was what you were talking about
26-03-2018T23:44:18,unsteddyphoenix,"You do get people who are really proud when they do get your name right, and correct other people for you."
26-03-2018T23:44:27,unsteddyphoenix,That's always super cute~
26-03-2018T23:46:08,SpazztasticKiwi,My name means “graceful”
26-03-2018T23:46:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I am not
26-03-2018T23:46:26,Dadrobit,"I just tell people ""close enough"""
26-03-2018T23:46:52,unsteddyphoenix,lol ive done my fair share of that too
26-03-2018T23:48:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I just looked it up Thomas is Greek for twin
26-03-2018T23:50:02,unsteddyphoenix,what a fun fact
26-03-2018T23:50:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Granted that’s not his first name but it counts
26-03-2018T23:51:37,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh yeah. I heard that Toms ""real"" first name is Jason?"
26-03-2018T23:51:49,unsteddyphoenix,I dont actually know if that's true or why that is :thinking:
26-03-2018T23:52:16,Bgrmystr2,Pretty sure that was something that Mark said in one of his videos
26-03-2018T23:52:22,Bgrmystr2,I vaguely recall it
26-03-2018T23:52:40,Bgrmystr2,doesn't bother me either way :u
26-03-2018T23:52:48,TheBeckoner,Say the right one 3 times and hell show up.
26-03-2018T23:52:53,TheBeckoner,he'll*
26-03-2018T23:52:54,Bgrmystr2,Tom's still Tom to me.
26-03-2018T23:53:37,Dadrobit,"Punctuation is certainly important, Beck."
26-03-2018T23:54:22,TheBeckoner,yuup lol
26-03-2018T23:54:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember that video. He was mentioning someone named Jason and I was just like “who?”
26-03-2018T23:54:27,TheBeckoner,realized that one quick
26-03-2018T23:54:30,Bgrmystr2,"to be fair, I'm not sure if there's a difference in this case."
26-03-2018T23:54:31,Bgrmystr2,:V
26-03-2018T23:56:32,SpazztasticKiwi,By the way I was thinking about my cats birthday
26-03-2018T23:56:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Kiwi’s is coming up but Bagheera never actually had one because we don’t know when exactly he was born
26-03-2018T23:57:10,unsteddyphoenix,cat party!? :ctwokinds-reniderp:
26-03-2018T23:57:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Last year I did decide that it was gonna be June 28 but my mom decided no because that’s her birthday
26-03-2018T23:57:45,SpazztasticKiwi,So I swapped to July 28
26-03-2018T23:59:19,Dadrobit,"I don't know Nyx's either, so I just celebrate it on my birthday so we can party together."
26-03-2018T23:59:39,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-katdryer: &lt;3
