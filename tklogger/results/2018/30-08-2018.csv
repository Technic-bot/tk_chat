30-08-2018T15:28:38,TheBeckoner,"I hope Tom streams for awhile today, otherwise I'll end up being at work for all of it..."
30-08-2018T15:29:26,Bgrmystr2,today is friady.. so prolly from 9pm till.. 1 or 2am his time..? if I had to guess
30-08-2018T15:30:05,Bgrmystr2,I'm actually expecting a comic page tonight
30-08-2018T15:30:12,Bgrmystr2,cuz it's about that time
30-08-2018T15:31:26,Mippy,The addiction is real folks. Every time I saw to myself ‚ÄúI should probably stop reading Twokinds for a while and let the pages pile up‚Äù I end up reading the next page as soon as it‚Äôs posted.
30-08-2018T15:31:45,Mippy,*say
30-08-2018T15:31:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"They kinda form their own heart in that pose, don‚Äôt they"
30-08-2018T15:33:26,TheBeckoner,I think mikes butt is the thing forming the heart
30-08-2018T15:33:57,TheBeckoner,And I hope so Bgr. If that ends up being the case then I'll catch the end of it.
30-08-2018T15:34:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I see that. Very well. But they‚Äôre also in their own little heart
30-08-2018T15:34:50,Bgrmystr2,"that's usually how it goes on friday beck, so"
30-08-2018T15:35:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless we get closed down on time I‚Äôll probably miss it
30-08-2018T15:36:23,Mippy,I‚Äôll miss it anyway. I gotta be up way too early for work tomorrow
30-08-2018T15:40:03,TheBeckoner,Ah well. Off to work I go. Maybe see y'all later
30-08-2018T15:50:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Same. I‚Äôll be back at lunch
30-08-2018T15:50:27,Twokinds,mmm food
30-08-2018T15:59:14,CatzArt,food!
30-08-2018T16:30:36,Twokinds,ow ow ow
30-08-2018T16:40:47,Dadrobit,"Ah man, just got back from lunch w/ grandma. Totally forgot I was going out with her today."
30-08-2018T16:41:20,Dadrobit,Was in the middle of a job when she came into my control room. Walked out on her coming in while I was only in my boxers.
30-08-2018T16:41:37,Dadrobit,"""What are you doing undressed in there???"""
30-08-2018T16:41:50,Dadrobit,"""uhhhhhh. Pants are loud."
30-08-2018T16:41:52,Dadrobit,""""
30-08-2018T16:42:18,Dadrobit,"Otherwise, lunch was nice."
30-08-2018T16:42:49,CatzArt,nice. I had chicken and dumplings
30-08-2018T16:43:59,Twokinds,I bit my tongue
30-08-2018T16:44:26,CatzArt,slow clap
30-08-2018T16:46:02,Dadrobit,Physically? Or metaphorically?
30-08-2018T16:46:24,Twokinds,Very physically
30-08-2018T16:46:27,Twokinds,owowow
30-08-2018T16:46:37,Twokinds,I have a napkin covered in blood
30-08-2018T16:46:45,CatzArt,ouch
30-08-2018T16:47:14,Dadrobit,Damn. Feelsbadman
30-08-2018T16:49:18,CatzArt,"Hey Tom, my copy of volume 4 and more came in today. Figured I'd let you know since keenspot sent an email saying they had delays."
30-08-2018T16:50:44,KittyLoveless,@Twokinds you were so hungry you almost ate your own tongue
30-08-2018T16:51:17,Twokinds,"Ah, that's great! :D"
30-08-2018T16:51:39,Twokinds,Glad Keenspot has managed to get shipping in gear
30-08-2018T16:53:25,Dadrobit,"Received a mass email about shipping being started, but nothing else just yet."
30-08-2018T16:54:04,CatzArt,yup good stuff. the old art style brings back good memories. I had forgotten what Keith's eyes looked like back in the day
30-08-2018T16:56:52,CatzArt,any plans for labor day Tom?
30-08-2018T16:58:29,Twokinds,labor day?
30-08-2018T16:59:20,Twokinds,Probably labor
30-08-2018T17:00:52,CatzArt,or is it memorial day im thinking of.
30-08-2018T17:01:08,CatzArt,what ever monday is
30-08-2018T17:13:44,CrimsonQuill,"@Twokinds my volume 4 hasn't arrived yet. I understand that it's busy, but I've heard nothing from them since my last email to them a month ago. It must be really busy."
30-08-2018T17:14:56,CrimsonQuill,I can't imagine how tricky it'd be getting all those orders out.
30-08-2018T17:26:43,ferociousfox,:tea::tea::tea: weekend
30-08-2018T17:36:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I haven‚Äôt checked my email. It likes to auto refresh normally every day
30-08-2018T17:36:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, your tongue is the fastest healing part of your body so you got that goin for you"
30-08-2018T17:41:08,CatzArt,too bad we cant vote for tom drawing himself biting his tongue for us &gt;_&lt;
30-08-2018T17:41:43,Bgrmystr2,I mean
30-08-2018T17:41:44,Bgrmystr2,why not?
30-08-2018T17:42:06,Bgrmystr2,"if you suggest it, and ppl vote for it, then he draws it"
30-08-2018T17:42:18,Bgrmystr2,but I dunno if it'd be voted
30-08-2018T17:42:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Probably nothing but a jolt and then lots of blood as he ran for a napkin
30-08-2018T17:42:42,Twokinds,Yeah it stopped hurting almost immediately
30-08-2018T17:42:53,Twokinds,Man I wish everything healed as fast as the tongue does
30-08-2018T17:42:55,Twokinds,That would be nice
30-08-2018T17:43:01,SpazztasticKiwi,If you wanna be sadistic that‚Äôs your thing but I‚Äôll pass
30-08-2018T17:43:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"Broke your arm? Give it an hour, you‚Äôre good"
30-08-2018T17:43:31,Bgrmystr2,lol.. I almost said make your whole body a tounge but...
30-08-2018T17:43:39,Bgrmystr2,let's just go with the healing factor lol..
30-08-2018T17:43:53,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs just multiple shades of wrong
30-08-2018T17:44:06,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
30-08-2018T17:44:15,KittyLoveless,that sounds creepy
30-08-2018T17:45:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I wish everything healed like the tongue. Wouldn‚Äôt have had to be left handed for two weeks when I broke my arm in middle school
30-08-2018T17:45:36,Bgrmystr2,at least you'd be able to be left handed.
30-08-2018T17:45:44,Bgrmystr2,"if I broke my right hand, I wouldn't be ANY handed."
30-08-2018T17:45:45,KittyLoveless,"but look at the bright side, you learned a new skill"
30-08-2018T17:46:13,KittyLoveless,i have never been able to write with my left hand
30-08-2018T17:46:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Never had to learn to write with it but hold a spoon threw me for a loop when it was with the other hand
30-08-2018T17:46:58,SpazztasticKiwi,*holding
30-08-2018T17:49:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"Ironically enough both my parents were left handed, though dad was technically ambidextrous"
30-08-2018T17:56:27,KittyLoveless,my dad is left handed and neither me nor any of my 3 siblings turned out left handed either
30-08-2018T18:22:57,SpazztasticKiwi,That new try not to laugh got me wheezing
30-08-2018T18:34:14,Bgrmystr2,there's hundreds of those
30-08-2018T18:34:40,Bgrmystr2,the new one you're talking about is probably already old compared to the 5 that came out in the next few mins :P

30-08-2018T20:52:01,Ordithus,"Turn it up to 11, Ron!"
30-08-2018T20:52:14,CrRAR,those are some quite fine lines~
30-08-2018T20:52:16,Ordithus,"Yeah, it's a pretty thin line"
30-08-2018T20:52:25,Unenlagia,That's a very thin line.
30-08-2018T20:52:28,Bgrmystr2,"for some ppl, marv I can't presume the two won't get confused. :v"
30-08-2018T20:52:53,Mihari,"You don't pay me enough to answer that question, Nekonny."
30-08-2018T20:52:57,SageSaga,naturally if you dont come back i would make sure you werent banned
30-08-2018T20:53:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"think it like this, Kicked though a door, for banished from the kingdom"
30-08-2018T20:53:21,Mihari,Wouldn't that make Ban pointless?
30-08-2018T20:53:26,SageSaga,yeah
30-08-2018T20:53:29,Nekonny,Not sure what you mean mihari ^^
30-08-2018T20:53:49,Mihari,"Nothing, just keeping a quota."
30-08-2018T20:53:53,SageSaga,Ron- what is with that V?
30-08-2018T20:54:12,Tharkis,a very fluffy train conductor bunny !
30-08-2018T20:54:12,Nekonny,V?
30-08-2018T20:54:17,Nekonny,the fingers?
30-08-2018T20:54:18,SageSaga,on her boob
30-08-2018T20:54:30,Nekonny,its the outfit
30-08-2018T20:54:40,SageSaga,what kinda outfit does that?
30-08-2018T20:55:09,Nekonny,the angle is throwing me off
30-08-2018T20:55:11,Mihari,It'Is that cleavage exposed or just the nature of the cut?
30-08-2018T20:55:19,Combak,Any that composed of two layers of cloth crossing over the chest?
30-08-2018T20:55:28,ferociousfox,Its the future
30-08-2018T20:55:34,Mihari,"Cause if it's open, then it's way too low."
30-08-2018T20:55:36,Tharkis,that's a folded collar front
30-08-2018T20:56:34,Ordithus,":ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot: ""I'll come back later"""
30-08-2018T20:57:09,Nekonny,its not meant to be open
30-08-2018T20:57:24,SageSaga,it looks like her boobs are popping out of it
30-08-2018T20:57:34,SageSaga,but i dont know how that can happen with something like that
30-08-2018T20:57:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:eyes:
30-08-2018T20:57:42,Mihari,It also looks like it's 1-2 sizes small.
30-08-2018T20:58:05,SageSaga,so its like a weird corset?
30-08-2018T20:58:21,Nekonny,a vest
30-08-2018T20:58:23,ferociousfox,:melon:
30-08-2018T20:58:38,SageSaga,uhhh
30-08-2018T20:59:17,SageSaga,a vest that holds itself up in the center and not on the shoulders?
30-08-2018T20:59:33,Mihari,That's more like a bustier
30-08-2018T20:59:57,Nekonny,hummm
30-08-2018T21:00:16,ferociousfox,clearly they're crisscrossed suspenders
30-08-2018T21:00:53,SageSaga,yeah a corset goes lower and not over the boobs-
30-08-2018T21:01:19,Ordithus,Clothing is hard.  Must be why Tom draws his characters nude so often.
30-08-2018T21:01:21,Nekonny,so a vest
30-08-2018T21:01:30,SageSaga,its clearly not a vest
30-08-2018T21:01:36,Nekonny,no?
30-08-2018T21:01:41,SageSaga,its not held up by the shoulders bro
30-08-2018T21:01:41,Twokinds,That actually is why... &gt;_&gt;
30-08-2018T21:01:47,Mihari,A vest goes over and encloses the collar.
30-08-2018T21:02:10,Twokinds,And the rest wear cloaks and turtlenecks so when I'm lazy I can just draw them entirely covered up
30-08-2018T21:02:11,Rosscoe,Evenings! Just stopping in quic kto say hi!
30-08-2018T21:02:13,Mihari,A corset or a bustier sits under the collar
30-08-2018T21:02:16,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Ross
30-08-2018T21:02:17,Nekonny,something like that?
30-08-2018T21:02:25,Mihari,That's a jacket
30-08-2018T21:02:28,SageSaga,those are nothing alike
30-08-2018T21:02:36,Nekonny,but cut out
30-08-2018T21:02:55,Mihari,Clothes have certain elements for a reason ya know XD
30-08-2018T21:02:56,SageSaga,if you cut off the shoulders then its holding in the center which is a Bustier
30-08-2018T21:03:03,Ordithus,"I knew it, Tom :ctwokinds-smug:"
30-08-2018T21:03:25,unsteddyphoenix,Or vague brown shirt and pant
30-08-2018T21:03:27,Rosscoe,Looking lovely guys! But  igota run to work now (Seriosuly JOGGING! RAWR!) Laters!
30-08-2018T21:03:28,unsteddyphoenix,A fan favourite~
30-08-2018T21:03:33,Nekonny,"Tom, your snow leopard character"
30-08-2018T21:03:42,Nekonny,she has the floof as well
30-08-2018T21:03:48,Nekonny,what does she wear? XD
30-08-2018T21:03:54,Nekonny,a dress?
30-08-2018T21:04:07,Ordithus,Floof is not a condition :ctwokinds-flomad:
30-08-2018T21:04:12,nwroot,lol clothes on kat
30-08-2018T21:04:22,RimaDraws,hiii
30-08-2018T21:04:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Ron, It looks like a vest dress"
30-08-2018T21:04:26,Twokinds,Uh...
30-08-2018T21:04:28,nwroot,hi
30-08-2018T21:04:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Rima
30-08-2018T21:05:02,Nekonny,vest... dress?
30-08-2018T21:05:12,Mihari,Marv is making up stuff.
30-08-2018T21:05:16,RimaDraws,how is everyone
30-08-2018T21:05:16,Mihari,Pay no mind.
30-08-2018T21:05:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I don't know clothes
30-08-2018T21:05:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Can I post a TK page with her in it.
30-08-2018T21:05:48,Mihari,Yes
30-08-2018T21:05:52,Bgrmystr2,lol ron what was that image that you just pulled up
30-08-2018T21:05:53,SageSaga,as we have said- it is not a vest because it has no shoulder support
30-08-2018T21:05:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/862/
30-08-2018T21:06:00,Ordithus,Another view http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/865/
30-08-2018T21:06:13,Nekonny,"right, sorry sage"
30-08-2018T21:06:33,Mihari,That's a corset/bustier
30-08-2018T21:06:40,Nekonny,^
30-08-2018T21:06:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Today I learned
30-08-2018T21:07:14,nwroot,wait now im confused
30-08-2018T21:07:21,BluePhantom90,yeah My sister bough a Corset... funny how many different types they have
30-08-2018T21:07:22,nwroot,oh
30-08-2018T21:07:30,nwroot,i hope nobody saw that
30-08-2018T21:07:52,RimaDraws,i had tried on a corset and it sucked
30-08-2018T21:07:58,RimaDraws,cant breathe for beans
30-08-2018T21:08:09,Mihari,"Yah, they aren't fun at all."
30-08-2018T21:09:05,SageSaga,that's fine Ron
30-08-2018T21:09:33,SageSaga,i mean the boobs are wrong but its about the design :P
30-08-2018T21:09:33,Nekonny,hum
30-08-2018T21:09:42,BluePhantom90,Well you might have gotten the wrong size? there are many sizes of them. If you couldn't breath it might mean you needed to get a larger size one.
30-08-2018T21:09:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,brb
30-08-2018T21:09:47,Nekonny,It's supposed to look like a train conductors uniform
30-08-2018T21:09:56,Nekonny,even though it's not what I thought it was
30-08-2018T21:10:02,Nekonny,so... how to adapt...
30-08-2018T21:10:06,Mihari,"Well I'll tell you this much, conductor's usually aren't that risque. XD"
30-08-2018T21:11:00,Mihari,"You don't need to adapt, it's just from that angle you wouldn't see any cleavage."
30-08-2018T21:11:15,Mihari,Unless it was SUPER LOW cut. Which is kinda absurd.
30-08-2018T21:11:31,Nekonny,"Thing is, I was trying to make her very fluffy on top"
30-08-2018T21:11:43,Nekonny,"so, covering it up doesnt work"
30-08-2018T21:12:25,Mihari,"So don't make it overually sexual, make it standard, and just don't do the highest buttons"
30-08-2018T21:12:28,Mippy,"Oh my, this looks like a very awkward page XD"
30-08-2018T21:12:57,Nekonny,standard?
30-08-2018T21:13:26,Mihari,"As in, normal jacket, you can lift up fluff to be outside of the enclosed area, and rest on top of the open parts."
30-08-2018T21:13:29,Nekonny,I should probably refine it from a front view first anyway
30-08-2018T21:13:30,unsteddyphoenix,just add moar floof
30-08-2018T21:13:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,all the floof
30-08-2018T21:13:41,Mihari,Do this...
30-08-2018T21:13:44,Mihari,Take that example image
30-08-2018T21:13:48,Mihari,And draw fluff on it.
30-08-2018T21:13:52,ShadowSoap,"Good evening, everyone!"
30-08-2018T21:14:01,Mihari,You'll have you're outfit.
30-08-2018T21:14:07,ferociousfox,evenin'
30-08-2018T21:14:12,nwroot,good evening
30-08-2018T21:14:31,unsteddyphoenix,Why does that make me vaguely worried that that trains gonna hit her
30-08-2018T21:14:52,Ordithus,Very literal
30-08-2018T21:15:20,Bgrmystr2,she's prolly not that close to the track lol
30-08-2018T21:15:21,Nekonny,no room left for fluff
30-08-2018T21:15:57,Nekonny,brb water
30-08-2018T21:16:04,Mihari,if it's a jacket and button blouse you'd put them on and then adjust the the fluff out the top
30-08-2018T21:19:34,CrRAR,what heavenly imagry
30-08-2018T21:19:38,CrRAR,*scruffles fluff*
30-08-2018T21:19:54,Mihari,It's much like how long hair works.
30-08-2018T21:20:41,CrRAR,tru
30-08-2018T21:22:58,Nekonny,back
30-08-2018T21:23:02,CrRAR,wb
30-08-2018T21:23:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,wb Ron
30-08-2018T21:23:26,Nekonny,I'll try
30-08-2018T21:24:25,Mihari,"Bottom line, if you don't understand how it works, don't try too, just draw the uniform how you want, put the fluff on the outside, you only need to worry about how it looks or is effected by the outfit if it visually does so."
30-08-2018T21:25:08,Nekonny,that was how it started tho
30-08-2018T21:25:34,Mihari,But you applied fundamental changes to the outfit to account for the fur
30-08-2018T21:25:44,CrRAR,"Keith's reaction, haha. :z"
30-08-2018T21:25:48,Nekonny,"right, I think I see what you mean"
30-08-2018T21:25:50,CrRAR,ultra confuzzled
30-08-2018T21:27:29,RimaDraws,oh god that face is too cute

30-08-2018T22:34:58,SageSaga,I think technically Poseidon was the god of all of earth not just water- but people kinda just historically say hes the water god
30-08-2018T22:35:11,SpazztasticKiwi,The aqua man of the gods
30-08-2018T22:35:12,CrRAR,ooo
30-08-2018T22:35:29,Combak,I think Gaia was god of the Earth...
30-08-2018T22:35:34,SageSaga,"because Hades was the god of the underworld, and Zeus was the god of the heavens basically-"
30-08-2018T22:35:35,Vatruvius,I believe Poseidon was the god of the ocean. Gaia is the Titan God of the Earth.
30-08-2018T22:35:39,Nekonny,earth is mostly water anyway
30-08-2018T22:35:40,SageSaga,no Gaia was a Titan

30-08-2018T22:36:24,Vatruvius,I have never heard Poseidon associated with the Earth as Gaia is.
30-08-2018T22:37:17,hyneria,Gaia was the mother of the titans
30-08-2018T22:37:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don‚Äôt see why Poseidon couldn‚Äôt control earth as well. Some of it has water or at least moisture in it, and it‚Äôs basically like, solid water‚Äù"
30-08-2018T22:37:20,SageSaga,Poseidon literally translates to Lord of the Earth
30-08-2018T22:37:25,hyneria,but she wasn't a tital herself

30-08-2018T22:38:41,SageSaga,Gaia was a primordial deity in Greek mythos- so she was a Titan
30-08-2018T22:38:51,hyneria,she wasn't :P
30-08-2018T22:39:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm more for Greek mythology and art myself
