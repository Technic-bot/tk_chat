10-03-2018T13:39:57,PhilTheIdle,Good night then.
10-03-2018T13:40:51,Combak,Is it exhausted tired or just tired? Because you might just need to move around a bit to take care of the second.
10-03-2018T14:01:01,Twokinds,"Standing upside down didn't do anything, now I'm just dizzy."
10-03-2018T14:01:27,BadFoMo,I just got here. What did I miss?!

10-03-2018T14:03:00,Twokinds,"I've had coffee, and caffeine tabs"
10-03-2018T14:03:22,Twokinds,Its just the lingering effects of the illness
10-03-2018T14:03:36,Twokinds,I can't shake the constant tiredness all the time.
10-03-2018T14:06:44,BluePhantom90,hmm well your like a reverse vampire right? hate daylight? If not take a little jog
10-03-2018T14:07:01,BoxStealthFox,Tried splashing some cold water on your face?
10-03-2018T14:07:19,Bgrmystr2,Blue that's a normal vampire
10-03-2018T14:07:23,Bgrmystr2,not a reverse one
10-03-2018T14:07:23,Combak,... Vampires hate daylight. A reverse vampire would be a normal person.
10-03-2018T14:07:31,Bgrmystr2,yeah exactly
10-03-2018T14:07:43,Bgrmystr2,blue wtf man xD
10-03-2018T14:08:23,BluePhantom90,When have you seen a Vampire up during the sun is up
10-03-2018T14:09:51,Bgrmystr2,That'sthepoint.jpg
10-03-2018T14:09:56,Bgrmystr2,you said the opposite
10-03-2018T14:10:41,qwe304,i got a new laptop friday
10-03-2018T14:10:55,qwe304,its got a drawing tablet built in
10-03-2018T14:11:01,Bgrmystr2,:o
10-03-2018T14:11:02,qwe304,so ive started drawing
10-03-2018T14:11:07,Bgrmystr2,cool
10-03-2018T14:11:32,BluePhantom90,lol Well I didn't word it right. Reverse in that Tom hates the sun but hates to be up during the day
10-03-2018T14:12:14,Bgrmystr2,..that's the very definition of a normal vampire. which is the opposite of reverse. xD
10-03-2018T14:13:33,qwe304,https://imgur.com/a/QSDtR this is what ive drawn so far
10-03-2018T14:13:42,BluePhantom90,-shrugs- hey some call that reverse where I am from
10-03-2018T14:13:56,Bgrmystr2,then they need to look up what a vampire is
10-03-2018T14:14:05,Combak,Cool Qwe.
10-03-2018T14:14:21,Bgrmystr2,"cuz vampires are weak to daylight, and dislike it"
10-03-2018T14:14:29,Bgrmystr2,and obviously wouldn't be up during the day
10-03-2018T14:14:39,Bgrmystr2,both of which are normal for a vampire
10-03-2018T14:15:14,Bgrmystr2,reverse vampire would be one that is up all day and is hurt by nighttime or something
10-03-2018T14:20:23,BluePhantom90,well it would suck to be one that hurts because its night time
10-03-2018T14:21:52,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: like most humans, who can't see and struggle with normal tasks during the night"
10-03-2018T14:21:55,Bgrmystr2,so we sleep through it
10-03-2018T14:21:59,Bgrmystr2,xD
10-03-2018T14:22:15,Bgrmystr2,super sucks
10-03-2018T14:23:02,BluePhantom90,they say that those that work the night shift tend to have a higher rate of Suicide... r-r
10-03-2018T14:32:19,CrRAR,To someone that's not a morning person waking up early is like a fate worse than death.

10-03-2018T15:21:06,Bgrmystr2,8 or 10 is fine
10-03-2018T15:21:15,KiTA,Didn't change it

10-03-2018T15:21:21,KiTA,they were using god magic to prevent conception
10-03-2018T15:21:23,The1Myth,or Keidran and Basitins.... Natani would be pissed
10-03-2018T15:21:25,KiTA,So they just stopped preventing it
10-03-2018T15:21:28,BadFoMo,@PalmettoPathfinder1 That's what I always think.
10-03-2018T15:21:30,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Sleep...is for the weak
10-03-2018T15:21:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Time is an entirely man made concept - it doesn’t completely exist

10-03-2018T15:21:51,KiTA,"Basically, making it so that it just never happened due to exceptionally bad luck, which they stopped doing"
10-03-2018T15:21:53,MviluUatusun,Sleep's way overrated.  Who needs to sleep?  Who?  Me!
10-03-2018T15:21:54,unsteddyphoenix,Gee that helps i feel less tired now
10-03-2018T15:21:57,Bgrmystr2,@KiTA That's considered a change.
10-03-2018T15:22:00,PalmettoPathfinder1,"@BadFoMo I think so too. Oh, and here I thought that they caught Daniels dropping his pants."
10-03-2018T15:22:02,Bgrmystr2,which would make them right.

10-03-2018T15:24:35,Bgrmystr2,yeah just cuz Cheetahs chirp does not mean they can't purr
10-03-2018T15:24:38,NeonMitsumi,"Lions, tigers, jaguars, and leopards cannot purr."
10-03-2018T15:24:39,CamtheGamerMan,Hello peoples
10-03-2018T15:24:40,MviluUatusun,The bone that allows great cats to roar prevents them from purring.

10-03-2018T15:24:55,MefjuTK,yas! i just click and all is back to normal XD
10-03-2018T15:25:02,BadFoMo,*Trace: So
10-03-2018T15:25:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tigers purr, but I live housecats who purr while breathing, Tigers only purr while exhaling"
10-03-2018T15:25:26,WereKeidran,"Regardsless of real life, I'm pretty sure that Flora has purred before, making tiger keidran able to purr"
10-03-2018T15:25:26,PalmettoPathfinder1,"So, I just realized that the lizardman cleric that Tom drew reminds me a bit of the lizards from the Divinity Series.  And yes, cheetahs do purr.  I've seen enough nature videos to know that they do.  Also jaguars also purr as well."
10-03-2018T15:25:27,The1Myth,Flora: Even she has bigger boobs than me! I demand a retcon!
10-03-2018T15:25:35,SpazztasticKiwi,*but while

10-03-2018T15:26:19,BluePhantom90,"Tigers don't purr, they chuff. And Chuffing means your friendly or trying to get a good whiff of you."

10-03-2018T17:30:18,Combak,Who knows.
10-03-2018T17:30:29,BuddrVinyl,"I originally wanted the full suggestion to be them acting out the vine where this guy is filming some dudes, and he’s like “Two bros, chillin in a hot tub, 5 feet apart cause they’re not gay”"
10-03-2018T17:30:30,ZephyrTWolffox,lol Combak

10-03-2018T17:31:14,Combak,I'm pretty sure that Vine is from Family Guy originally. XD
10-03-2018T17:31:21,MuonNeutrino,have we seen tom draw mechanical stuff like that before?
10-03-2018T17:31:25,Combak,Looks like Full Metal though.
10-03-2018T17:31:33,Combak,Um.... The Fallout sketch?

10-03-2018T17:31:55,Glassan,FMA trace is wonderfully coincidental for me. I just finished binging FMA: Brotherhood during work the last few days.
10-03-2018T17:31:57,Bgrmystr2,it's not armored
10-03-2018T17:32:00,markoatonc,anyway.. as much as I love the streams it is almost midnight so I go to sleep... I just hope TOM will see my idea....

10-03-2018T17:47:48,DuskyChu,"Ah, finally."
10-03-2018T17:47:48,BadFoMo,Why did I get the sketch request idea for Keith as Darth Helmet?
10-03-2018T17:47:56,NeonMitsumi,Heya Dusky
10-03-2018T17:48:08,CrimsonHelsing,"you mean Dark Helmet, @BadFoMo"

10-03-2018T17:48:22,BadFoMo,@CrimsonHelsing Thank you.
10-03-2018T17:48:31,CrimsonHelsing,np
10-03-2018T17:49:08,CamtheGamerMan,It would be interesting to see Flora as a machinist
10-03-2018T17:49:20,Bgrmystr2,Mechanic* ..?
10-03-2018T17:49:30,unsteddyphoenix,Machiner

10-03-2018T17:49:36,SleepyDrake,&lt;_&lt; Fur and a lathe would be bad
10-03-2018T17:49:37,MuonNeutrino,i like how you can tell from how it's off center that this sketch started out as just trace and then tom decided to add the other two
10-03-2018T17:49:38,Bgrmystr2,yes clearly
10-03-2018T17:49:39,DarthKeidran,I guess I need to change what I typed earlier. Keith: I am MechaKeith. Danger Flora Legacy! Danger!
10-03-2018T17:49:39,CamtheGamerMan,Sure lets go with that
10-03-2018T17:50:00,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Those three are adorable
10-03-2018T17:50:04,Bgrmystr2,"or, muon, the fact that it's physically off-center"
10-03-2018T17:50:07,MefjuTK,flora looks soo cute &lt;3
10-03-2018T17:50:08,Bgrmystr2,on the big white box
10-03-2018T17:50:10,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Flora ""I hope these upgrades won't make your arm fall off like last time"""

10-03-2018T17:50:24,ZahnHolley,3
10-03-2018T17:50:27,MetalAppleSauce,NO
10-03-2018T17:50:28,DuskyChu,"Well, jeebus."
10-03-2018T17:50:54,Combak,"Well, this sketch spiraled out of control from the original suggestion."
10-03-2018T17:50:55,MuonNeutrino,"@Bgrmystr2 .... uhhh, that's what i said? confused"
10-03-2018T17:50:58,DarthKeidran,I’ve got a feeling this is a bonus upgrade to the suggestion.
10-03-2018T17:51:04,CrRAR,The ears are still obvs Keith's weak point.
10-03-2018T17:51:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Toms on a roll Combak
10-03-2018T17:51:23,Bgrmystr2,"naw Muon, cuz you were looking at the image content itself"
10-03-2018T17:51:33,DuskyChu,"CrRAR... I haven't seen you in forever, jeeze..."
10-03-2018T17:51:43,Bgrmystr2,wouldn't really matter what the img is
10-03-2018T17:51:48,NeonMitsumi,Keith's finally same height as Natani. No need for books to stand on now!
10-03-2018T17:51:57,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
10-03-2018T17:52:00,Vatruvius,^
10-03-2018T17:52:04,MetalAppleSauce,Nah this keith is far taller than natani
10-03-2018T17:52:07,unsteddyphoenix,Assuming Nat isnt scaled up somehow
10-03-2018T17:52:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nat can wear Keith now
10-03-2018T17:52:10,MuonNeutrino,....? i really have no idea what you're on about
10-03-2018T17:52:30,MuonNeutrino,i was commenting that you can tell it grew in the drawing from how trace was centered and the others were off to the side
10-03-2018T17:52:31,ThingsAreMoving,:urn: as a homunculus in the distance
10-03-2018T17:52:48,Twokinds,Done

10-03-2018T17:53:09,ZephyrTWolffox,Excellent!
10-03-2018T17:53:12,Katfeathers,Nat and Zen would be the prince and princess from the east
10-03-2018T17:53:12,BoxStealthFox,This is neat!
10-03-2018T17:53:13,w0lfmare,Looks good
10-03-2018T17:53:14,MuonNeutrino,and now it's time for Keith And Natani Do A Thing! =D
10-03-2018T17:53:18,unsteddyphoenix,Was a great amine
10-03-2018T17:53:21,NeonMitsumi,Good stuff

10-03-2018T17:53:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Zen as Ling.... Yes please
10-03-2018T17:53:32,UnknownEnd,(Awe)some
10-03-2018T17:53:33,MuonNeutrino,"(really i like keith/nat sketches, that acronym just amuses me ^^)"
10-03-2018T17:53:35,SleepyDrake,"FMA is probably the best ""popular"" manga from recent times"
10-03-2018T17:53:49,Bgrmystr2,"lol, Muon, that's so vague tho"
10-03-2018T17:54:00,HeresyArtStream,"I swear the opening lyrics for FMA was ""who can turn down a good cookie?"
10-03-2018T17:54:04,Bgrmystr2,I love how ppl get upset about it and then describe it in the vaguest way possible
10-03-2018T17:54:09,MuonNeutrino,that too heh
10-03-2018T17:54:19,BadFoMo,That wrench looks a little warped to me.
10-03-2018T17:54:20,MuonNeutrino,"i think that's the point, though"
10-03-2018T17:54:29,CanisRufusUK,"I I see Tom is being artisty ""Done"".... *continues to tweek work* ;)"
10-03-2018T17:54:29,Bgrmystr2,lets get angry at EVERYTHING because we have nothing specific to angry at
10-03-2018T17:54:33,Bgrmystr2,:D
10-03-2018T17:54:36,HeresyArtStream,I heard the live action FMA show on Netflix was kind of crap. Not sure if I want to watch it.
10-03-2018T17:54:36,CrRAR,it's a quantum wrench
10-03-2018T17:54:47,unsteddyphoenix,Same I heard bad things
10-03-2018T17:54:51,BadFoMo,Thank you.
10-03-2018T17:54:58,HeresyArtStream,Netflix should probably stay out of the live action anime business.
10-03-2018T17:54:59,ThingsAreMoving,good things
10-03-2018T17:55:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'm have a fan gasim over zen with a poen shirt and troy bakers voice coming out of him.
10-03-2018T17:55:00,CamtheGamerMan,Bravo @Kinipshun awesome suggestion
10-03-2018T17:55:07,SleepyDrake,"oO Never, ever watch live-action anime adapations."
10-03-2018T17:55:09,ItsActuallyKopyKat,That tends to happen a lot with livestream remakes of anime
10-03-2018T17:55:11,Katfeathers,wasn't bad in my oppinion
10-03-2018T17:55:21,Bgrmystr2,"you could try to name a single decent live-action anime anything, heresy... and"
10-03-2018T17:55:21,CrimsonHelsing,Xd
10-03-2018T17:55:22,HeresyArtStream,"FMA could potentially be great as a live action movie, but anime-to-live action adaptations never seem to end well."
10-03-2018T17:55:23,Bgrmystr2,you'd fail
10-03-2018T17:55:24,Bgrmystr2,but
10-03-2018T17:55:26,Bgrmystr2,yknow
10-03-2018T17:55:27,HeresyArtStream,Except Speed Racer. :V
10-03-2018T17:55:31,HeresyArtStream,I love Speed Racer.
10-03-2018T17:55:31,Katfeathers,Coulda been worse
10-03-2018T17:55:33,CrimsonHelsing,I honestly like this change in outcome tbh
10-03-2018T17:55:48,w0lfmare,The live action movie tried to fit too much in. That was it's problem
10-03-2018T17:55:48,CrimsonHelsing,but uh... is this the last pic?
10-03-2018T17:55:53,thestooge,A lot of people really do like Speed racer
10-03-2018T17:56:00,CrimsonHelsing,hush my mouth!
10-03-2018T17:56:00,Bgrmystr2,"there's 7 usually, Crimson"
10-03-2018T17:56:09,SleepyDrake,"It would be physically possible to make a good anime adapataion. I don't think it could actually happen in reality though. The only people who want to, shouldn't be allowed."
10-03-2018T17:56:09,PalmettoPathfinder1,Dang I missed this vote.  I had internet lag.
10-03-2018T17:56:14,TheVileOne,Did I just see an FMA sketch?
10-03-2018T17:56:19,CrRAR,yerp
10-03-2018T17:56:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,yep
10-03-2018T17:56:20,BadFoMo,Yep.
10-03-2018T17:56:21,ItsActuallyKopyKat,lol like the Avatar movie... remember that monstrosity?
10-03-2018T17:56:29,ZephyrTWolffox,ya
10-03-2018T17:56:38,Edinku,Anime to Live Action never go well. Just like videogames to movies
10-03-2018T17:56:39,kts,sadly yes -.-
10-03-2018T17:56:43,Bgrmystr2,"This one is gonna be #5, the one we voted on (though the vote says 4)"
10-03-2018T17:56:46,Edinku,(hello/hola!)
10-03-2018T17:56:47,Bgrmystr2,should be.

10-03-2018T17:57:23,NeonMitsumi,Heya Bruno!
10-03-2018T17:57:26,BadFoMo,Didn't Dragon Ball Z go live action ones?
10-03-2018T17:57:30,CrimsonHelsing,I can't make heads of tails of it yet
10-03-2018T17:57:32,DuskyChu,"Been a while, Bruno!"
10-03-2018T17:57:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,we don't talk about the FoMo
10-03-2018T17:57:37,Bgrmystr2,@TheVileOne yeah there was an FMA sketch
10-03-2018T17:57:41,Edinku,We don't talk about that BadFoMo
10-03-2018T17:57:41,BadFoMo,*once.
10-03-2018T17:57:51,Edinku,Just like the Last Airbender
10-03-2018T17:58:00,ItsActuallyKopyKat,^ ^
10-03-2018T17:58:01,CamtheGamerMan,The only way videogames work with movies is if the story itself is original but has video games as the back drop. Wreck it Ralph taught me that
10-03-2018T17:58:02,Edinku,and f*ckin Eragon (my childhood)
10-03-2018T17:58:04,Bgrmystr2,there's been quite a few live action anime
10-03-2018T17:58:07,Edinku,DDD:
10-03-2018T17:58:07,Bgrmystr2,all of them have been bad.
10-03-2018T17:58:09,ThingsAreMoving,Last airbender could've work as a live action tv show
10-03-2018T17:58:11,ItsActuallyKopyKat,YES :(
10-03-2018T17:58:12,ThingsAreMoving,not a movie
10-03-2018T17:58:17,Edinku,YES!
10-03-2018T17:58:25,CrRAR,someone having a spa day?
10-03-2018T17:58:33,Combak,"Well, from a first glance, this looks pretty morbid."
10-03-2018T17:58:34,Vatruvius,Keith and Natani
10-03-2018T17:58:37,unsteddyphoenix,^
10-03-2018T17:58:37,Combak,Not a complaint!
10-03-2018T17:58:38,Bgrmystr2,"I don't see why people wouldn't just watch the animated tv show, Things"
10-03-2018T17:58:39,WereKeidran,Did miss a vote?
10-03-2018T17:58:39,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. it
10-03-2018T17:58:44,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Nat and Keith in the hot tub
10-03-2018T17:58:45,MviluUatusun,"BTW, I've got a new commission.  Would anyone like to see it?  Send me a whisper and I'll give you a link."
10-03-2018T17:58:46,Edinku,Eragon could had been like a tv series just like Game of Thrones.
10-03-2018T17:58:47,Bgrmystr2,it's * already got episodes and stuff..
10-03-2018T17:58:49,PalmettoPathfinder1,Maybe my request didn't make it in time.  Although I might have missed it.  Did anyone see my request of Reni and Winter in the poll?
10-03-2018T17:58:50,Combak,We've done 3.
10-03-2018T17:58:51,ItsActuallyKopyKat,waggles eyebrows
10-03-2018T17:58:59,NeonMitsumi,Just remake that old panel.
10-03-2018T17:59:05,BadFoMo,What about Akira? Wasn't that in the works?
10-03-2018T17:59:06,Combak,"3 Rounds of voting, that is."
10-03-2018T17:59:13,ThingsAreMoving,the animated show was 10/10 but people always want more of the good stuff
10-03-2018T17:59:29,SleepyDrake,Some things are just really cool in live action
10-03-2018T17:59:33,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Akira and Cowboy Bepop are in talk FoMo

10-03-2018T18:00:58,Vatruvius,^
10-03-2018T18:01:03,Xexanoth,the difference between the book and a series is visualization
10-03-2018T18:01:07,TorqueEmUp,because books can ruin your eyesight. :P
10-03-2018T18:01:11,HeresyArtStream,I'd love to stick around but sadly I gotta jet. Hope you all have fun!

10-03-2018T18:01:31,SleepyDrake,I'm reasonably sure the audience for animated material is smaller than straight up books.
10-03-2018T18:01:37,Combak,Bye Heresy?

10-03-2018T18:02:14,ThingsAreMoving,"Damn, phoenix. Dunno if we can go deeper"

10-03-2018T18:03:00,unsteddyphoenix,Did I stutter?
10-03-2018T18:03:01,SleepyDrake,They're just different mediums.
10-03-2018T18:03:14,RyanReaper,What is some of the sketches I’ve missed?
10-03-2018T18:03:28,Xexanoth,but not different enough to warrant the different version most times
10-03-2018T18:03:29,Katfeathers,judicius use of cgi did the live fma well
10-03-2018T18:03:29,SleepyDrake,"@FaalKruziik I'd rather see Speaker for the Dead, personally"

10-03-2018T18:34:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"Granted, there’s good fics, but there’s also some that go too far down the rabbit hole"
10-03-2018T18:34:21,Chippotatothefirst,Did it just end?

10-03-2018T18:34:57,unsteddyphoenix,Basically writes itself
10-03-2018T18:35:02,Dadrobit,I can do that
10-03-2018T18:35:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"I want to go make some burritos, but I don’t want to get up"

10-03-2018T18:37:37,Dadrobit,"Under the careful ministrations of the slave owner Eric, Rainse found her chest heaving not unlike a bulemic after a Thanksgiving feast."
10-03-2018T18:37:39,Chippotatothefirst,If that’s the case then I have been thoroughly socked

10-03-2018T18:43:24,Chippotatothefirst,She must always be sad
10-03-2018T18:43:35,Xexanoth,so does everyone who reads your fanfics
10-03-2018T18:43:49,Dadrobit,I am top tier thank you very much.
10-03-2018T18:43:53,SpazztasticKiwi,How old were they when they taught you if they’re dead so shortly after
10-03-2018T18:44:12,unsteddyphoenix,They died after reading his puns
10-03-2018T18:44:15,Dadrobit,"They're probably still alive, but it has been a decade."
10-03-2018T18:44:38,Dadrobit,"Well, 7 years."

10-03-2018T18:45:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I do puns too. Don’t think you Raine in that category

10-03-2018T18:48:25,Gthefurrybiker,Eep!
10-03-2018T18:48:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Puns for days
10-03-2018T18:49:12,SpazztasticKiwi,I blame my sense of humor on the internet and the people I follow
10-03-2018T18:49:30,unsteddyphoenix,Same. Damn them.
10-03-2018T18:52:00,Dadrobit,:( Sinuses are crap still and ears are plugged. Hate colds.
10-03-2018T18:53:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Hot. Bath.
10-03-2018T18:53:38,Dadrobit,"Don't have a bath, only shower."
10-03-2018T18:54:08,MarshallMelon,Same solution. Steam clears sinuses to an extent.
10-03-2018T18:54:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Yep
10-03-2018T18:54:53,SpazztasticKiwi,My cat tried to kill me walking through the hall with my burritos
10-03-2018T18:55:01,Dadrobit,"Yeah, but I don't want to stand there and soak, wish I had a proper tub."
10-03-2018T18:55:58,MarshallMelon,I mean if you're desperate you could fill a bowl or sink with boiling water and inhale. Probably nowhere near as efficient though.
10-03-2018T18:56:07,unsteddyphoenix,Lifehack: just fill your bathroom with water a la Shape of Water
10-03-2018T18:56:38,Dadrobit,Seems legit.
10-03-2018T18:57:12,PalmettoPathfinder1,Boy that is one hungry kitty @SpazztasticKiwi
10-03-2018T18:57:31,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s always hungry
10-03-2018T18:58:00,Dadrobit,Why did your cat have your burritos?
10-03-2018T18:58:10,unsteddyphoenix,details
10-03-2018T18:58:15,PalmettoPathfinder1,Animals like strange foods.
10-03-2018T18:58:32,Dadrobit,My cat legit hates human food.
10-03-2018T18:58:44,PalmettoPathfinder1,I stand correted
10-03-2018T18:58:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Obviously I had them on a plate walking down the hall to my room
10-03-2018T18:59:26,SpazztasticKiwi,And he was right on my heels like he was trying to trip me
10-03-2018T19:00:12,Twokinds,=_=
10-03-2018T19:00:31,unsteddyphoenix,D'aw~
10-03-2018T19:00:45,MarshallMelon,Obviously he was just trying to turn them into purritos
10-03-2018T19:00:50,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah theyre especially underfoot while youre trying to cook normally
10-03-2018T19:00:59,unsteddyphoenix,boo!
10-03-2018T19:01:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Holly do that to you Tom?
10-03-2018T19:01:18,Twokinds,Yeah
10-03-2018T19:01:25,Dadrobit,Nyx leanred her lesson early on. How many times did I accidentaly kick her dancing in my living room...
10-03-2018T19:01:50,Dadrobit,She stays a safe distance from my feet when I'm walking around.
10-03-2018T19:01:51,unsteddyphoenix,Dont kick your cat while shes dancing...
10-03-2018T19:02:15,SpazztasticKiwi,At least Bagheera sits with a tiny paw perched on you. I’ve seen other cats straight up steal a giant bite and run off
10-03-2018T19:02:34,Dadrobit,"All I was trying to do was a tango, unsteddy!"
10-03-2018T19:02:50,Dadrobit,Not my fault she has two left feet!
10-03-2018T19:02:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Doesn’t that take two people
10-03-2018T19:03:20,Dadrobit,Or a person and an enthusiastic kitten.
10-03-2018T19:03:21,unsteddyphoenix,"Ofc she has two left feet, she has four legs!"
10-03-2018T19:03:31,Dadrobit,(That's the joke)
10-03-2018T19:03:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Though dancing with your cat gets rid of the stepping on your toes problem
10-03-2018T19:03:47,unsteddyphoenix,(I know I was being the straight man)
10-03-2018T19:04:04,unsteddyphoenix,smart

10-03-2018T19:06:05,unsteddyphoenix,Dont blink

10-03-2018T19:06:47,Dadrobit,Alaric vs Maddie sparring/fencing. Alaric is getting pissed as she's impossible to land a hit on.
10-03-2018T19:07:10,unsteddyphoenix,"Oooh it didnt come up, prob tomorrow"
10-03-2018T19:07:13,Dadrobit,An unstoppable force vs an untouchable object.

10-03-2018T19:07:59,unsteddyphoenix,Wish that one had been there
10-03-2018T19:08:02,DarthKeidran,If Tom doesn’t post anything today I posted on the community page to tide people over.

10-03-2018T19:09:16,SpazztasticKiwi,It comes to my mind whenever I spot either of my cats staring
10-03-2018T19:09:26,DarthKeidran,Is the stream still running?
10-03-2018T19:09:31,Bgrmystr2,lol no

10-03-2018T19:09:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom’s still lurking through
10-03-2018T19:09:53,DarthKeidran,"OK, the way you guys were talking made me think that it was still running."
10-03-2018T19:09:54,MarshallMelon,About an hour or so now
10-03-2018T19:09:59,unsteddyphoenix,allegedly
10-03-2018T19:10:03,MarshallMelon,"Nah, this is just the afterparty"
10-03-2018T19:10:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you think he’s not, you’re lying to yourself"
10-03-2018T19:10:41,DarthKeidran,hooray for after parties!
10-03-2018T19:12:43,Combak,Bye all! Have a good week!

10-03-2018T19:13:07,Dadrobit,cya combak
10-03-2018T19:18:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Why do cats have the urge to move as soon as you’re stepping over them
10-03-2018T19:18:28,Bgrmystr2,"Darth, I think you may need to read through the chat during and after the stream more often"
10-03-2018T19:18:33,Bgrmystr2,cuz it's very different
10-03-2018T19:19:21,unsteddyphoenix,Practise their reflexes
10-03-2018T19:19:25,unsteddyphoenix,Good training
10-03-2018T19:19:34,MarshallMelon,Yeah. Afterstream chat's a lot more reserved since most people leave when the stream ends. Good for conversation.
10-03-2018T19:19:45,unsteddyphoenix,I still want pictures of your cats spazz.
10-03-2018T19:19:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Well one day he’s going to have 140 pounds on his reflexes
10-03-2018T19:20:29,unsteddyphoenix,His reflexes are TOO FAST he'll DODGE IT
10-03-2018T19:21:06,SpazztasticKiwi,This cat has ran himself into the wall after a laser light
10-03-2018T19:21:34,SpazztasticKiwi,And smacked his head on my bed frame playing with his stuffed toys
10-03-2018T19:21:35,Bgrmystr2,"Lool, I'd make a reference that I'm sure would go over most of your heads.. but I guarentee someone will catch it."

10-03-2018T19:59:34,Dadrobit,That's legitimately a good point.
10-03-2018T19:59:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Saying chubby guys can’t have a girl
10-03-2018T19:59:40,unsteddyphoenix,I was told to NOT do too much cardio
10-03-2018T19:59:48,Bgrmystr2,lol yeah kiwi
10-03-2018T19:59:49,Dadrobit,I don't ask for any more that what I ask from myself.
10-03-2018T19:59:57,TorqueEmUp,^
10-03-2018T20:00:19,unsteddyphoenix,"Im saying you get what you deserve, thats all"
10-03-2018T20:00:21,TorqueEmUp,Hit the nail on the head there.
10-03-2018T20:00:26,Bgrmystr2,Personality is what matters imo
10-03-2018T20:00:53,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, that's the same. People with shitty personalities will probably only get with each other."
10-03-2018T20:01:00,Bgrmystr2,well yeah
10-03-2018T20:01:04,unsteddyphoenix,But I cant make my personality swole
10-03-2018T20:01:09,unsteddyphoenix,...or can I...
10-03-2018T20:01:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"You realize over buffing can be counterproductive, right? Not only for you, but there’s some girls that don’t want to sleep next to a plank of wood"
10-03-2018T20:01:22,Bgrmystr2,but ppl with good personalities but horrible body types will likely never get anyone good cuz so many people judge by appearance
10-03-2018T20:01:24,unsteddyphoenix,Lol overbuffing will never be a problem for me
10-03-2018T20:01:46,Dadrobit,"Also, don't date people who have nothing to lose. If they don't have an understanding of working for something and working to keep it, they're probably not gonna do it for you either."
10-03-2018T20:02:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Who doesn’t want to be able to squeeze their darling

10-03-2018T20:05:38,TorqueEmUp,I like how people always have to share that they are going to the gym
10-03-2018T20:06:04,Dadrobit,"Well It's not like I'm basing my whole life around health, just enough that I feel good about looking in the mirror."

10-03-2018T20:06:47,unsteddyphoenix,I definitely have a friend that stares at himself in the mirror while he works out
10-03-2018T20:07:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"Some people need variety, yeah"
10-03-2018T20:07:21,Bgrmystr2,Well don't worry Torque. I don't go to the gym :D

10-03-2018T20:08:40,unsteddyphoenix,Did you start hi-5ing yourself on the way out?
10-03-2018T20:08:44,Dadrobit,"Nope, it was the mirror that stood behind the sink."

10-03-2018T20:37:32,TorqueEmUp,I think it's because we expect too much out of a date

10-03-2018T20:41:16,TorqueEmUp,*shrug*
10-03-2018T20:41:22,Dadrobit,Just because I'm white. Literally the worst.
10-03-2018T20:41:24,TorqueEmUp,I guess I had the rare exception
10-03-2018T20:41:29,unsteddyphoenix,Ugh WHITE people
10-03-2018T20:41:40,Vatruvius,HWY!
10-03-2018T20:41:44,Vatruvius,HEY*
10-03-2018T20:41:51,Dadrobit,"Had to speak Spanish whenever I was in her house, English was unacceptable."
10-03-2018T20:41:56,Bgrmystr2,"And she should care about what her mother says why? If my mother was like that, I'd give her shit"
10-03-2018T20:41:58,unsteddyphoenix,"Haha, oh wow"
10-03-2018T20:41:59,Bgrmystr2,cuz that's fucked up
10-03-2018T20:42:18,Dadrobit,Refused to come to family parties.
10-03-2018T20:42:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"Thing is, I lean with how he treats those around him"
10-03-2018T20:42:35,Dadrobit,Made my life Hell whenever I went to one of hers.
10-03-2018T20:42:49,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, see how they treat the waiter"
10-03-2018T20:42:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’m the one dating him, so mine is the final vote"
10-03-2018T20:43:11,unsteddyphoenix,Nah I can see where Dads coming from
10-03-2018T20:43:18,SpazztasticKiwi,And animals. Always observe how they treat animals
10-03-2018T20:43:37,TorqueEmUp,Her family liked me. Even got to go with them on a family vacation for a week with them.
10-03-2018T20:43:46,Vatruvius,Hmm...now that you mention it...I do not think I could ever be with someone who hates dogs.
10-03-2018T20:43:51,unsteddyphoenix,"I had something like that, dated a black girl once. Her fam had built a slight bias against white people after her last bf who hadnt treated her well was white"
10-03-2018T20:44:09,unsteddyphoenix,"They got over it, though"
10-03-2018T20:44:22,unsteddyphoenix,(I think)
10-03-2018T20:44:35,Bgrmystr2,"Gotta meet someone that's got a good head on their shoulders, basically"
10-03-2018T20:44:38,Vatruvius,"Changing people's opinions is good unsteddy, not easy to do but makes the world a better place."
10-03-2018T20:44:41,Dadrobit,I'm actually heated now...
10-03-2018T20:44:58,TorqueEmUp,uh oh
10-03-2018T20:44:59,Bgrmystr2,"Preach it, Vatru"
10-03-2018T20:45:04,unsteddyphoenix,Literally PEEVED
10-03-2018T20:45:19,Dadrobit,Fuuuuuuck that lady.
10-03-2018T20:45:26,Vatruvius,"Looking for someone smart, go to nerd parties. Best ones ever if you can withstand all the bad puns. I identify as a nerd though so perhaps there is a slight bias... :D"
10-03-2018T20:45:29,Bgrmystr2,I can understand Dadro
10-03-2018T20:45:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"They don’t have to like animals; they can be allergic and we’ll never have a furry pet, I just ask they treat them with respect"
10-03-2018T20:45:34,Bgrmystr2,a lot of people down here are like that
10-03-2018T20:45:49,TorqueEmUp,My ex didn't even like me hurting bugs
10-03-2018T20:45:51,unsteddyphoenix,No they have to like animals or i JUDGE them &gt;:(
10-03-2018T20:45:58,Vatruvius,Do not get me started @Bgrmystr2
10-03-2018T20:46:08,Dadrobit,"""Un Maldito Gringo"" screw her and her bullshit."
10-03-2018T20:46:33,TorqueEmUp,"even though she didn't like bugs, it bothered her if I wanted to straight up squish them."
10-03-2018T20:46:49,unsteddyphoenix,Depends on the bug imo
10-03-2018T20:47:07,unsteddyphoenix,"Mosquitos and flies can die, but I feel a little bad killing spiders"
10-03-2018T20:47:08,Vatruvius,My sister would require someone to willing squash all bugs within 50ft of her.
10-03-2018T20:47:11,unsteddyphoenix,They din' do nuffin
10-03-2018T20:47:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t have a problem with bugs until they’re in my bubble
10-03-2018T20:47:44,Dadrobit,"BBL gonna go put on some music, get this energy out."
10-03-2018T20:47:53,unsteddyphoenix,Go headbang your feelings away
10-03-2018T20:48:00,Bgrmystr2,alright dadro
10-03-2018T20:48:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Cept wasps. I will not go within 100 feet of one of them
10-03-2018T20:48:07,Dadrobit,7o7
10-03-2018T20:48:08,Bgrmystr2,Wasps are bastards
10-03-2018T20:48:08,TorqueEmUp,Fuck wasps
10-03-2018T20:48:19,Bgrmystr2,My dad is deathly allergic to bees and wasps and shit
10-03-2018T20:48:20,Vatruvius,You have no idea how many times my sister would scream across the hall and demand me to kill a fly because it is in her room. Just a harmless fly.
10-03-2018T20:48:27,Bgrmystr2,"I'm not, but yknow"
10-03-2018T20:48:31,Bgrmystr2,fuck them anyway
10-03-2018T20:48:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"If there’s a wasp, I am outie"
10-03-2018T20:48:35,Bgrmystr2,same
10-03-2018T20:48:40,TorqueEmUp,wasps are the bane of all existance
10-03-2018T20:48:59,Vatruvius,Hold up...any of you want to see an epic wasp killing youtube video?
10-03-2018T20:49:19,Bgrmystr2,"I mean.. at least bees make sense. Making honey for queen, helping flowers grow, etc"
10-03-2018T20:49:23,Bgrmystr2,wasps are just..
10-03-2018T20:49:24,SpazztasticKiwi,They’re Satan’s hateful balls of spite
10-03-2018T20:49:30,Bgrmystr2,"""Fuck you die"" - wasp"
10-03-2018T20:49:31,TorqueEmUp,Bees don't bother me at all.
10-03-2018T20:49:47,TorqueEmUp,Bees are fairly humble
10-03-2018T20:49:51,Vatruvius,"Wasps eat decomposing flesh, they are scavengers. They are not nice, but a big party of nature."
10-03-2018T20:49:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Humble bumble
10-03-2018T20:50:03,TorqueEmUp,"Wasps and Hornets are always. ""Fuck you because I see you!"""
10-03-2018T20:50:11,Bgrmystr2,IKR Torque
10-03-2018T20:50:21,SpazztasticKiwi,They can have their party the hell away from me
10-03-2018T20:50:39,unsteddyphoenix,agreed miss me with that
10-03-2018T20:51:08,TorqueEmUp,That is the best thing about winter.
10-03-2018T20:51:13,TorqueEmUp,no wasps
10-03-2018T20:51:28,Bgrmystr2,We get wasp nests and stuff sometimes outside of our house
10-03-2018T20:51:32,TorqueEmUp,less bugs in general
10-03-2018T20:51:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Only reason moving somewhere cold could appeal to me
10-03-2018T20:51:52,TorqueEmUp,"Except for those fucking annoying stinkbugs, those bastards are everywhere."
10-03-2018T20:52:00,Bgrmystr2,hate those things
10-03-2018T20:52:09,Vatruvius,I live out in the forest and my cousins came over for an airsoft fight...to sum it up a wasp nest was in the middle of it all and were walking all over it. I am pretty sure you can guess how that went.
10-03-2018T20:52:18,unsteddyphoenix,Ugh apparently some sort of stinkbugs are going to infest my country soon &gt;&lt;
10-03-2018T20:52:22,SpazztasticKiwi,From relationships to bugs
10-03-2018T20:52:34,unsteddyphoenix,Theyre coming over from overseas in like furniture
10-03-2018T20:52:36,Vatruvius,"Later in the year though a bear came buy and just ate the whole thing looking for honey as if ""wasps, these are nothing."""
10-03-2018T20:52:52,TorqueEmUp,Stinkbugs have already infested my country
10-03-2018T20:52:55,TorqueEmUp,thanks asia
10-03-2018T20:53:01,TorqueEmUp,'preciate that
10-03-2018T20:53:09,unsteddyphoenix,feels bad
10-03-2018T20:53:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Asia itself didn’t do it - human greed did
10-03-2018T20:53:51,TorqueEmUp,maybe a little
10-03-2018T20:53:55,TorqueEmUp,lol
10-03-2018T20:54:06,TorqueEmUp,stupid bugs
10-03-2018T20:54:26,TorqueEmUp,damn things seem to fly around with no aim or direction
10-03-2018T20:54:50,TorqueEmUp,they also like to fly into ceiling fans
10-03-2018T20:55:04,SpazztasticKiwi,And windows
10-03-2018T20:55:16,TorqueEmUp,"I dunno how many times I was at my ex's place, and I'd hear a stinkbug ping off the ceiling fan."
10-03-2018T20:55:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Though that’s every bug
10-03-2018T20:55:25,Bgrmystr2,haha
10-03-2018T20:55:28,Bgrmystr2,that's funny though
10-03-2018T20:56:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Try having a wasp get caught in your hair and get mad at you about it
10-03-2018T20:56:28,TorqueEmUp,Ouch
10-03-2018T20:56:38,Vatruvius,Just no...
10-03-2018T20:57:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Our neighbor heard me scream
10-03-2018T20:57:42,Bgrmystr2,jesus fuck no
10-03-2018T20:57:53,Vatruvius,Here is the link to the wasp video...if any of you know this guy then you are awsome!
10-03-2018T20:57:54,TorqueEmUp,*shudders*
10-03-2018T20:57:55,Bgrmystr2,miss me with that &gt;:C
10-03-2018T20:57:57,Vatruvius,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSdM1syogog
10-03-2018T20:58:06,unsteddyphoenix,What did they do after hearing you scream?
10-03-2018T20:58:24,unsteddyphoenix,Do you like...call the cops or go over or something? :thinking:
10-03-2018T20:58:27,SpazztasticKiwi,They called “did you hear that scream?”
10-03-2018T20:58:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"Phone call, that is"
10-03-2018T20:58:39,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha
10-03-2018T20:58:44,unsteddyphoenix,Did you tell them it was you
10-03-2018T20:58:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Yes
10-03-2018T20:59:04,unsteddyphoenix,"Foolish, shoulda lied"
10-03-2018T20:59:09,Bgrmystr2,lool
10-03-2018T20:59:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I was busy icing the sting on my jaw
10-03-2018T20:59:26,Bgrmystr2,"hey, ain't no shame in screaming if you've got a fuckin wasp stuck in your hair"
10-03-2018T20:59:46,Bgrmystr2,do NOT want
10-03-2018T20:59:56,Vatruvius,"Been a while since I watched this video, I forgot how satisfying it is to watch."
10-03-2018T21:00:41,SpazztasticKiwi,He didn’t get me too good though - more like pricking yourself with a needle than a true sting
10-03-2018T21:03:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’ve also been stung on the finger, arm, back, foot, and neck"
10-03-2018T21:03:21,unsteddyphoenix,This is why you dont go outside people
10-03-2018T21:03:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Wasps can die in a fire
10-03-2018T21:03:58,Vatruvius,I would hate to come across the insect that cannot die in a fire...
10-03-2018T21:04:12,Vatruvius,Ohh...I get what you meant Kiwi
10-03-2018T21:04:16,Vatruvius,lol
10-03-2018T21:04:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Just blowtorch em
10-03-2018T21:05:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I can see it now though: “Why are you under the table?” “There’s a wasp in the kitchen”
10-03-2018T21:06:01,Vatruvius,"Judging by how much you hate wasps Kiwi you should really watch that video, so many dead wasps."
10-03-2018T21:06:31,Bgrmystr2,does he flamethrower them?
10-03-2018T21:07:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve seen a few blowtorch exterminations. Others just stand there in a bed suit and hack at the nest till they find a queen
10-03-2018T21:07:32,Vatruvius,"No, but there is a lot of spray wasp poison going on. Just click on the link I posted up in the chat, there is even a cut kitten in the beginning."
10-03-2018T21:07:56,Vatruvius,cute*
10-03-2018T21:09:31,TorqueEmUp,Your screen name makes me want to watch the Lego Movie again
10-03-2018T21:10:02,Vatruvius,Me?
10-03-2018T21:10:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom, you got a thing that makes you “nope”?"
10-03-2018T21:10:10,TorqueEmUp,Yop
10-03-2018T21:10:37,Vatruvius,Cool!
10-03-2018T21:10:41,Bgrmystr2,I'm busy watching 3 streams so
10-03-2018T21:10:43,TorqueEmUp,That was a fuckton of wasps in that video
10-03-2018T21:10:44,Bgrmystr2,I'll watch it later
10-03-2018T21:10:45,Vatruvius,:ptv-excited:
10-03-2018T21:10:59,Vatruvius,"Yeah, wasn't it."
10-03-2018T21:11:20,TorqueEmUp,Those bastards love derelict cars too
10-03-2018T21:11:31,TorqueEmUp,I've got a parts car in my folk's backyard
10-03-2018T21:11:49,TorqueEmUp,can't go anywhere near it during the warmer months
10-03-2018T21:12:15,TorqueEmUp,They love to make nests behind the fuel door
10-03-2018T21:13:09,Vatruvius,"Eww...that is just upsetting. I am lucky to live in the foothills though, not many wasps up here at all. Most abundant insect I come across up here are probably ants but I find them interesting so..."
10-03-2018T21:13:25,SpazztasticKiwi,We have 3 different types
10-03-2018T21:13:42,TorqueEmUp,Most common around here are yellow jackets
10-03-2018T21:14:09,Twokinds,nope
10-03-2018T21:14:14,Vatruvius,lol
10-03-2018T21:14:23,Bgrmystr2,Tom with zero fears confirmed
10-03-2018T21:14:24,Vatruvius,We found out.
10-03-2018T21:14:32,Bgrmystr2,or at least..
10-03-2018T21:14:33,Bgrmystr2,zero nopes.
10-03-2018T21:14:56,TorqueEmUp,"But I do see red wasps, and paper wasps a lot too, just not as often as the yellow jackets"
10-03-2018T21:14:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"Heights, needles, nothing?"
10-03-2018T21:15:11,Vatruvius,Playing Alien Isolation on the two hardest difficulties yields...many nopes.
10-03-2018T21:15:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom’s a robot guys
10-03-2018T21:15:26,TorqueEmUp,Fuck that game. XP
10-03-2018T21:15:50,TorqueEmUp,Just a sneaking simulator where the alien always knows where you are.
10-03-2018T21:15:57,Vatruvius,We have already confirmed that Tom and Sage are AI/Robots...this just adds more proof.
10-03-2018T21:16:00,Twokinds,Frogs
10-03-2018T21:16:00,TorqueEmUp,Nothing fun about that game at all
10-03-2018T21:16:10,Twokinds,Terrifying.
10-03-2018T21:16:14,TorqueEmUp,Really frog? or you mean frenchmen?
10-03-2018T21:16:18,TorqueEmUp,:P
10-03-2018T21:16:23,Vatruvius,huh...snap
10-03-2018T21:16:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a pet frog
10-03-2018T21:16:33,SpazztasticKiwi,She has teeth
10-03-2018T21:16:35,Bgrmystr2,xD Tom
10-03-2018T21:16:37,TorqueEmUp,Interesting though
10-03-2018T21:17:07,TorqueEmUp,I used to like picking up little frogs when i'd see them hopping through the grass.
10-03-2018T21:17:12,TorqueEmUp,when I was a kid
10-03-2018T21:17:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"But all things considered, not a weird distaste"
10-03-2018T21:17:50,Vatruvius,"Toads creep me out while frogs I think are kinda cool. You would never see me pick one up though in the jungle, I think they are cool but I am not stupid."
10-03-2018T21:18:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel there’s a story behind it though
10-03-2018T21:18:25,Vatruvius,Agh...but mom!?! Someone here want to do my dishes for me...please?
10-03-2018T21:18:33,TorqueEmUp,"Never understood the fear of rats, or other rodents."
10-03-2018T21:18:41,unsteddyphoenix,Note: Tom has never drawn a frog
10-03-2018T21:18:47,unsteddyphoenix,Coincidence? UNLIKELY.
10-03-2018T21:18:49,Vatruvius,Do not get me started @TorqueEmUp
10-03-2018T21:19:05,TorqueEmUp,"I've got pet rats, they are so adorable"
10-03-2018T21:19:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I think it’s more the concept of disease around rodents than the rodents themselves
10-03-2018T21:19:22,TorqueEmUp,Pretty much
10-03-2018T21:19:37,TorqueEmUp,"Even though rats are very clean animals, we are just the ones that made them dirty in the first place"
10-03-2018T21:19:39,Vatruvius,"I do not fear them but when I have to go under the house which is full of ventilation above you and you see rat poop everywhere, the paranoia of rats jumping of top of you will never go away."
10-03-2018T21:19:41,TorqueEmUp,with our cities
10-03-2018T21:19:54,Twokinds,They say the average person swollows 7 frogs in their sleep every year.
10-03-2018T21:20:00,TorqueEmUp,wat
10-03-2018T21:20:04,Vatruvius,Lie!
10-03-2018T21:20:05,unsteddyphoenix,lmao
10-03-2018T21:20:07,Vatruvius,Flase!
10-03-2018T21:20:10,unsteddyphoenix,Nah thats true
10-03-2018T21:20:14,unsteddyphoenix,I HEARD it from the INTERNET
10-03-2018T21:20:14,TorqueEmUp,Cute ratties! http://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/19000000/Cute-rat-small-animals-19096270-1024-768.jpg
10-03-2018T21:20:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Where the hell do you live where frogs can regularly get in your home
10-03-2018T21:20:30,Vatruvius,You be careful there unsteddy
10-03-2018T21:20:45,TorqueEmUp,http://amazingcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/adorable-rat-pictures-7.jpg
10-03-2018T21:21:10,Vatruvius,"The internet is a dangerous place, I am here for example."
10-03-2018T21:21:20,Vatruvius,"Okay, not the dangerous, but still..."
10-03-2018T21:21:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"Especially when there’s pets in the house, particularly cats - some will hunt and eat frogs"
10-03-2018T21:22:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless Holly’s too sophisticated for that. My sister’s cat is like that
10-03-2018T21:22:36,unsteddyphoenix,"Uh, really?"
10-03-2018T21:22:43,TorqueEmUp,I used to be scared of balloons popping. :P
10-03-2018T21:22:47,Twokinds,Lost my first cat to the frogs.
10-03-2018T21:22:54,Twokinds,Poor Holly0
10-03-2018T21:22:56,TorqueEmUp,rip
10-03-2018T21:23:09,TorqueEmUp,sorry to hear :(
10-03-2018T21:23:12,Vatruvius,"My grandparents have cats to deal with their mice problem, but I have actually seen these mice in the house and they are too cute to kill. Just buy an extra box of cereal, seriously."
10-03-2018T21:23:13,unsteddyphoenix,H0lly
10-03-2018T21:23:20,SpazztasticKiwi,HOLLY NO
10-03-2018T21:23:29,unsteddyphoenix,Now I see why this Holly only stays inside
10-03-2018T21:23:36,unsteddyphoenix,The frog menace strikes again..
10-03-2018T21:23:50,Twokinds,Yeah much safer
10-03-2018T21:24:19,Vatruvius,If you are really scared of frogs Tom you would have hated my last house. We lived near a creak/bog and you would never sleep past 11pm unless you like the frog orchestra.
10-03-2018T21:24:27,SpazztasticKiwi,My sisters cat stays in because she’s mostly white and fluffy
10-03-2018T21:25:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"Mom’s cat stays in because she’s afraid of the outdoors, and my cats stay in because I refuse to let something happen"
10-03-2018T21:25:29,Vatruvius,"Agh...guess I have to go now. I will be back in a bit...after these ******* dishes are dealt with. ""Hey mom, can I just through all these away? You could just buy new ones?"""
10-03-2018T21:25:54,SpazztasticKiwi,We don’t have as many frogs as we do cicadas around here
10-03-2018T21:26:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Or at least the frogs just add to the noise
10-03-2018T21:26:23,TorqueEmUp,ewww cicadas
10-03-2018T21:26:33,TorqueEmUp,freaky looking things
10-03-2018T21:26:45,TorqueEmUp,noisy as all fuck too
10-03-2018T21:27:39,Bgrmystr2,they sound awesome though
10-03-2018T21:27:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"All they do is sleep for like 17 years, maturing in the dirt, then wake up one day and scream “I’m ready to mate!”"
10-03-2018T21:27:45,Bgrmystr2,when it's just you and the outside
10-03-2018T21:27:52,Bgrmystr2,and you're just chillin under the moonlight
10-03-2018T21:27:52,Bgrmystr2,etc
10-03-2018T21:27:54,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds like the life
10-03-2018T21:28:14,SpazztasticKiwi,They don’t live very long though
10-03-2018T21:28:20,Bgrmystr2,"Cicadas I think we used to have when I lived in GA, or something that sounded similar to them"
10-03-2018T21:28:50,unsteddyphoenix,Even better /s
10-03-2018T21:31:24,Bgrmystr2,"Phoenix, we need you in sage's stream with a bouncybutt gif"
10-03-2018T21:31:25,Bgrmystr2,D:
10-03-2018T21:31:49,unsteddyphoenix,Sage streams today too?
10-03-2018T21:31:52,SpazztasticKiwi,And most fall prey to the parasitic fly that injects their own eggs to slowly feed on the cicada till they hatch
10-03-2018T21:31:55,unsteddyphoenix,Thats like 3rd day in a row
10-03-2018T21:32:11,Bgrmystr2,Sage is streaming w/ maty
10-03-2018T21:32:22,Bgrmystr2,doing.. stuff :ptv-ohmy:
10-03-2018T21:32:35,Bgrmystr2,for today at least
10-03-2018T21:33:09,unsteddyphoenix,!! his stream is tagged NSFW!
10-03-2018T21:33:11,unsteddyphoenix,Nani!
10-03-2018T21:33:44,Bgrmystr2,XDD
10-03-2018T21:34:05,Bgrmystr2,But it's not NSFW.. just borderline
10-03-2018T21:34:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Like high school
10-03-2018T21:34:42,Bgrmystr2,xD
10-03-2018T21:35:12,unsteddyphoenix,lol
10-03-2018T21:39:53,SpazztasticKiwi,:ptv-dealwithit:
10-03-2018T21:43:11,Dadrobit,Back
10-03-2018T21:43:27,Dadrobit,I'll consider that my workout for the day. Solid hour of cardio.
10-03-2018T21:47:13,SpazztasticKiwi,We talked about relationships and wasps and fears
10-03-2018T21:47:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom’s not a fan of frogs, and none of us like wasps"
10-03-2018T21:48:09,unsteddyphoenix,Did...did you just dance for an hour?
10-03-2018T21:48:43,Dadrobit,Yes?
10-03-2018T21:48:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Just pirouetting around the living room for an hour
10-03-2018T21:49:34,unsteddyphoenix,Seems good
10-03-2018T21:50:09,Dadrobit,Tossed some swing on the stereo and went ham.
10-03-2018T21:50:14,Dadrobit,As one does
10-03-2018T21:50:31,unsteddyphoenix,Does one do that?
10-03-2018T21:50:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll stick to the Macarena
10-03-2018T21:51:01,Dadrobit,S'what I do.
10-03-2018T21:51:07,unsteddyphoenix,I'll stick to being white and not dancing
10-03-2018T21:52:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"Or Cupid Shuffle, Electric Slide, the usual"
10-03-2018T21:52:34,Dadrobit,"Help me break the mold, unsteddy. White people can dance!"
10-03-2018T21:53:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"I used to square dance, but that’s a two person thing and it’s not easy finding someone else that knows too"
10-03-2018T21:53:50,unsteddyphoenix,But can we jump?
10-03-2018T21:54:22,Dadrobit,TBD
10-03-2018T21:54:25,SpazztasticKiwi,To conclusions
10-03-2018T21:58:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"By the way, can I vent a little annoyance?"
10-03-2018T21:59:28,Dadrobit,"Hell, I did it. So long as it's not political, it's gucci."
10-03-2018T21:59:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"Cause I know a lady. She spoils her little dog - nothing terribly new, I know, but she feeds it from the table"
10-03-2018T22:00:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"Again not new, but what she’ll feed it every time is her favorite dish she cooks - potatoes and onions with butter and sometimes garlic"
10-03-2018T22:00:52,SpazztasticKiwi,ONIONS AND GARLIC IS POISONOUS TO DOGS
10-03-2018T22:01:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"and she won’t listen, despite this information coming from multiple sources, including a retired vets assistant"
10-03-2018T22:02:26,TorqueEmUp,*shrug*
10-03-2018T22:02:29,unsteddyphoenix,Oooof
10-03-2018T22:02:31,TorqueEmUp,people can be frustrating
10-03-2018T22:02:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Now do I particularly like the dog? No - it’s aggressive. But I also don’t want it slowly poisoned
10-03-2018T22:02:40,unsteddyphoenix,yeah thats just unpleasant
10-03-2018T22:03:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"That just came back to me, and now I’m slightly salty"
10-03-2018T22:03:30,Dadrobit,People are a bunch of bastards.
10-03-2018T22:04:05,TorqueEmUp,Some dogs are more resistant to things that are supposed to be poisonous to them then others.
10-03-2018T22:04:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"If they don’t know, it’s another story, but refusing to stop when advised, idk"
10-03-2018T22:05:16,TorqueEmUp,"They probably do think. Hey the dog is just fine when I feed, them, why should I listen to you."
10-03-2018T22:05:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"They cause anemia over a span of time, like how chocolate builds up in their system"
10-03-2018T22:05:48,TorqueEmUp,wow I still can't brain today
10-03-2018T22:05:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"But if she’s not going to listen, I tried"
10-03-2018T22:06:29,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah some people will never listen no matter what
10-03-2018T22:07:23,TorqueEmUp,Also people are like that because they hate being told what to do.
10-03-2018T22:07:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I know my cousin started feeding her dog a raw diet. She researched the hell out of what to get and how to do it. Her dog’s finally getting better
10-03-2018T22:08:08,TorqueEmUp,I personally think people go a little overboard with buying expensive food for their pets
10-03-2018T22:09:16,TorqueEmUp,"That's just me though, people can do whatever they want to with their pets as long as it doesn't hurt them."
10-03-2018T22:09:24,SpazztasticKiwi,My cousin’s dog had to be switched though. She wasn’t absorbing the protein in her food and she was loosing weight because of it
10-03-2018T22:10:11,TorqueEmUp,kinda reminds my of me ex's mothers butthole of a cat.
10-03-2018T22:10:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"I see it as a bit strange too, but it’s like humans adjusting their diets - sometimes you have to, sometimes you do because you can"
10-03-2018T22:10:52,TorqueEmUp,"Had got poisoned by food, couldn't be fed anything other then wet food from then on."
10-03-2018T22:11:22,TorqueEmUp,But that was the cat food that had poisoned it
10-03-2018T22:11:37,TorqueEmUp,not table scraps
10-03-2018T22:12:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"My mom’s dog can’t digest simple grains, so he gets grain free food"
10-03-2018T22:12:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"But he’s less than 4 pounds, so it’s not bad"
10-03-2018T22:13:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’d cook meals for my cats, but they’re just fine on cat food"
10-03-2018T22:13:14,TorqueEmUp,No posts for Patreon today Tom?
10-03-2018T22:14:20,Twokinds,obviously
10-03-2018T22:14:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Battery at 50% yet?
10-03-2018T22:14:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Or u still feel like 5%?
10-03-2018T22:15:07,TorqueEmUp,"My ex didn't like to change her cat's food, as she believed it stresses them out if you change what they are used to."
10-03-2018T22:15:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Not sure about that - it might if it’s a drastic change
10-03-2018T22:16:21,TorqueEmUp,Hey just thought i'd ask. :sweat:
10-03-2018T22:16:25,SpazztasticKiwi,My sister’s cat is picky with her food. Will NOT eat raw meat
10-03-2018T22:16:45,unsteddyphoenix,...weird.
10-03-2018T22:17:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Though maybe “spoiled” is a better word
10-03-2018T22:17:26,unsteddyphoenix,"Had a cat that used to eat anything orginally, THEN she got spoiled"
10-03-2018T22:17:28,Dadrobit,Same
10-03-2018T22:17:37,unsteddyphoenix,Could feed her leftover pasta and she'd eat it
10-03-2018T22:17:41,Dadrobit,Nyx won't even eat fish
10-03-2018T22:18:10,TorqueEmUp,I think I am just going to leave...
10-03-2018T22:18:39,SpazztasticKiwi,👌🏻👋🏻
10-03-2018T22:19:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera may be the only one that would eat a raw fish
10-03-2018T22:19:53,unsteddyphoenix,ODD.
10-03-2018T22:20:07,Twokinds,My cat doesn't like fish

10-03-2018T22:20:31,Bgrmystr2,does not like fish?
10-03-2018T22:20:43,Dadrobit,At least two
10-03-2018T22:21:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"My mom’s cat won’t eat an actual fish, but she’ll eat fish flavored kibble"
10-03-2018T22:21:13,unsteddyphoenix,THANK you bgr
10-03-2018T22:21:18,unsteddyphoenix,What is happening
10-03-2018T22:21:38,SpazztasticKiwi,And my sister’s cat hates chicken flavor
10-03-2018T22:21:44,Twokinds,"When I give her seafood canned food, it's always just left there. It's the only type she doesn't like."
10-03-2018T22:22:31,Dadrobit,"Yup, tried wet food and just straight up fish. Sniffs both and then just leaves em."
10-03-2018T22:22:39,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:
10-03-2018T22:22:42,Dadrobit,Only likes the cheap dry stuff
10-03-2018T22:22:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"Kiwi hates all canned food. Poof and Cookie will eat only certain types, i.e. seafood"
10-03-2018T22:23:13,unsteddyphoenix,Your cats are brats lol
10-03-2018T22:23:23,unsteddyphoenix,"I clearly did not know what ""spoiled"" meant"
10-03-2018T22:23:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Kiwi and Bagheera are mine. The others are not my problem
10-03-2018T22:24:50,SpazztasticKiwi,My mom and sister are the ones that have to deal with their picky eaters
10-03-2018T22:25:18,Dadrobit,"I mean, I don't mind this kind of picky."
10-03-2018T22:25:35,Dadrobit,"I tried spoiling her, but she just wants the cheap stuff"
10-03-2018T22:25:48,Twokinds,My cat is fat.
10-03-2018T22:25:54,Dadrobit,"Alright, my budget doesn't mind"
10-03-2018T22:26:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Kiwi’s a bit tubby too
10-03-2018T22:26:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"But she’s also a long haired, fluffy cat, so there’s that too"
10-03-2018T22:26:29,unsteddyphoenix,Tom if Holly doesnt go outside your room then your only feasible option is to buy her giant hamster wheel
10-03-2018T22:26:46,Dadrobit,"My kitty has to dodge my living room flailing all the time, no choice but to be skinny."
10-03-2018T22:26:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Or laser pointer

10-03-2018T22:27:00,unsteddyphoenix,Kick your cat until she dodges

10-03-2018T22:33:20,SpazztasticKiwi,So 😛
10-03-2018T22:34:01,unsteddyphoenix,Flora is hypoallergenic
10-03-2018T22:34:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though if indoor cats live to be about 20, Poof’s about 50 in terms of her lifespan"
10-03-2018T22:34:58,unsteddyphoenix,"More like 40, humans generall dont often like to 100"
10-03-2018T22:35:04,SpazztasticKiwi,If using a 100 year scale
10-03-2018T22:35:36,SpazztasticKiwi,We know she has a bit of arthritis
10-03-2018T22:35:47,Dadrobit,First kitty was 21 before she died.
10-03-2018T22:36:04,Dadrobit,Here's hoping I have another couple decades w/ my new one
10-03-2018T22:36:42,unsteddyphoenix,I also hope this
10-03-2018T22:37:28,SpazztasticKiwi,My grandma had a cat that was already full grown when I was born and lived on till I was 15
10-03-2018T22:38:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"Hated me, too, but she hated all kids and some strangers"

10-03-2018T22:39:50,Dadrobit,How about some ice creame?
10-03-2018T22:39:51,unsteddyphoenix,We found our cat too. She was just a stray that we fed sometimes until she had kittens on my sisters bed
10-03-2018T22:40:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Passed through an hour ago
10-03-2018T22:40:06,Vatruvius,I'll take it.

10-03-2018T22:43:18,Vatruvius,Is Tom still around or did he go to bed?
10-03-2018T22:43:38,Dadrobit,I live for that kind of uncanny horror.

10-03-2018T22:50:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I was waiting for you to shoot your question
10-03-2018T22:50:19,Vatruvius,"Look, I like boobs like the net guy but there comes a point where I just can't possibly get turned on by them."
10-03-2018T22:50:22,Dadrobit,"And of course, my stance on that is fairly well known..."
10-03-2018T22:50:40,Vatruvius,Ohh...let me type that up Kiwi
10-03-2018T22:50:54,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah theres definitely an upper limit
10-03-2018T22:50:59,Vatruvius,"Um, what do you mean unsteddy?"
10-03-2018T22:51:23,Dadrobit,B-cup
10-03-2018T22:51:32,unsteddyphoenix,Alright calm down there.
10-03-2018T22:51:35,Dadrobit,lol
10-03-2018T22:52:08,unsteddyphoenix,Since bra-sizes are incomprehensible it's hard to say what's too big but
10-03-2018T22:52:11,unsteddyphoenix,It exists
10-03-2018T22:52:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"There’s times I wish I was more blessed, but at the same time..."
10-03-2018T22:52:47,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s not terribly hard to understand bra sizes
10-03-2018T22:53:01,unsteddyphoenix,There's letters AND numbers
10-03-2018T22:53:03,Dadrobit,"brb, getting a drink"
10-03-2018T22:53:04,unsteddyphoenix,It's literally algebra
10-03-2018T22:53:21,Vatruvius,"My sketch idea involves Mark, Tom's brother. I have no idea if he would draw a sketch with his brother in it. The idea is this though; Mark, King of the Squirrels, faces down Mrs. Nibbly for the title."
10-03-2018T22:53:53,SpazztasticKiwi,The letters are cup sizes (do you have apples or watermelons?) and the numbers are your rib cage size
10-03-2018T22:54:18,unsteddyphoenix,Rib cage size... :ctwokinds-keithdotdotdot:
10-03-2018T22:54:36,Twokinds,"Sorry, I wouldn't be interested in drawing my brother."
10-03-2018T22:55:11,Vatruvius,"Even I know about chest size, I have to know so I can get the right suit shirt."
10-03-2018T22:55:14,unsteddyphoenix,Huh. Any reason why? Or just dont want to.
10-03-2018T22:55:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"Ever had a tape measure put around your waist to measure for pants? It’s like that, but under the boobs around the chest"
10-03-2018T22:55:33,Vatruvius,"Well, I will just have to imagine it then. Thanks though Tom."
10-03-2018T22:56:15,unsteddyphoenix,"So your literal chest size is taken into account, then"
10-03-2018T22:56:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Yep
10-03-2018T22:56:23,unsteddyphoenix,Suppose it'd have to be for bra fittings
10-03-2018T22:56:41,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s where the clip part goes after all
10-03-2018T22:58:02,Vatruvius,"Hey Tom, has there ever been sketches that you have done because they were voted been never really wanted to do them? Or are all of those filtered out before anyone can vote in the first place?"
10-03-2018T22:58:26,Twokinds,I filter the sketches before the stream.
10-03-2018T22:58:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"There’s probably been some...colorful ones, I’m sure"
10-03-2018T22:59:00,Twokinds,"Not really, it's mostly spoiler stuff."
10-03-2018T22:59:29,Vatruvius,"Wow, people can guess that well or are they like obvious spoiler had they read the comic closely enough?"
10-03-2018T22:59:45,Twokinds,"To be honest, it's almost 90% human Reni"
10-03-2018T22:59:46,SpazztasticKiwi,People and their imaginations...
10-03-2018T22:59:52,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha
10-03-2018T23:00:28,Vatruvius,Well...I guess there is a large attraction to Reni in human form.
10-03-2018T23:00:34,unsteddyphoenix,Damn really? Is it really different people each week having the idea?
10-03-2018T23:00:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d think there’d be a few asking for portraits of themselves in TK form
10-03-2018T23:00:55,Twokinds,Never gotten that.
10-03-2018T23:01:15,Dadrobit,Back
10-03-2018T23:01:28,Dadrobit,"""literally algebra"" I'm stealing that."
10-03-2018T23:01:37,unsteddyphoenix,Yo
10-03-2018T23:01:43,Twokinds,I don't think I've ever gotten a suggestion involving someone's personal character.
10-03-2018T23:01:44,Vatruvius,But they would have to send a picture so how would they do that? They would have to explain their face detail in a sentence.
10-03-2018T23:01:59,unsteddyphoenix,"Thats against the rules, isnt it?"
10-03-2018T23:02:05,Dadrobit,"""No OC's"" pretty much covers it I htink"
10-03-2018T23:02:08,SpazztasticKiwi,That’d be another thing too
10-03-2018T23:02:09,Twokinds,Yeah obviously
10-03-2018T23:02:10,Dadrobit,think*
10-03-2018T23:02:12,Vatruvius,That would fall in the OC catagory.
10-03-2018T23:02:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"But yes, it can be like algebra"
10-03-2018T23:02:57,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s a reason women can use a full day to shop
10-03-2018T23:02:59,Dadrobit,And he's probably not interested at looking at a bunch of 4's
10-03-2018T23:03:19,Dadrobit,#ApplyWaterToTheBurnedArea
10-03-2018T23:03:25,Vatruvius,"Actually, there is probably some calculus involved the manufacture of bras to make them the most comfortable while also being the most particle, or am I just talking ****?"
10-03-2018T23:03:27,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao
10-03-2018T23:03:46,Twokinds,Gotta make the bras the most particle
10-03-2018T23:03:49,unsteddyphoenix,"Easy to guess what we probably look like, dont need to see it."
10-03-2018T23:03:55,Vatruvius,OMG...lol
10-03-2018T23:04:06,unsteddyphoenix,Quantum bra-straps
10-03-2018T23:04:16,Dadrobit,"Not only Algebra, shit's particle physics."
10-03-2018T23:04:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"They’re not comfortable, are you crazy?"
10-03-2018T23:04:18,Vatruvius,"Particle bras, the newest, hottest thing since hover boards! Get yours today!"
10-03-2018T23:04:38,unsteddyphoenix,"Someone call up Musk, stat"
10-03-2018T23:04:51,Dadrobit,Hydrogen powered bras
10-03-2018T23:05:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"They itch, can slide around, and attribute to boob sweat"
10-03-2018T23:05:05,Vatruvius,"Hey, I do not shop for bras but there are a lot of ads for them when I shop for cloths and all say ""comfort"" on them. I would have no idea if that is true or not."
10-03-2018T23:05:21,unsteddyphoenix,Does Natani just have particle bandages?
10-03-2018T23:05:40,Vatruvius,"In her dimensional bandages, I would think so."
10-03-2018T23:05:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"And if you get one with underwire, you risk your own bra stabbing you if it gets out of the stitching"
10-03-2018T23:06:03,Dadrobit,"No joke, Hanes X-Temp boxer briefs are like the most comforable thing in the world."
10-03-2018T23:06:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Fabulous. Make a bra out of it
10-03-2018T23:06:41,Vatruvius,My mom and sister have complained openly to me about the wire bras. I do not think they have them anymore.
10-03-2018T23:07:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"Makes you look good, but they’re a pain"
10-03-2018T23:07:40,unsteddyphoenix,BEAUTY IS SUFFERING
10-03-2018T23:07:42,Vatruvius,"My sister is part of the ""no bra"" movement. If should could go without a bra should most certainly will."
10-03-2018T23:07:43,unsteddyphoenix,Or whatever
10-03-2018T23:07:48,Dadrobit,https://www.hanes.com/shop/hanes/bras/hanes-womens-sport-top-h570 There ya go
10-03-2018T23:07:51,Vatruvius,she*
10-03-2018T23:07:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Tbh though wrapping a piece of cloth to make a bra probably would work for smaller ladies
10-03-2018T23:07:59,Vatruvius,What is going on with my spelling today?
10-03-2018T23:08:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"So Nat has a good idea, though she’s more wrapping them to conceal them than to provide comfort and support"
10-03-2018T23:09:29,Dadrobit,Hanes has 8 different styles and comfort levels in their X-Temp bras
10-03-2018T23:09:32,unsteddyphoenix,Mmm. I think most women would still...like their boobs visible.
10-03-2018T23:09:36,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe
10-03-2018T23:09:55,Vatruvius,"But, they are dimensional bandages so technically she is braless?"
10-03-2018T23:09:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I know a few that say they get in the way
10-03-2018T23:10:09,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah ive heard that too
10-03-2018T23:10:15,Dadrobit,Yup
10-03-2018T23:10:28,unsteddyphoenix,Assuming a silent majority here.
10-03-2018T23:10:48,Dadrobit,"Hmmm, I can get a student discount?"
10-03-2018T23:10:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"The bigger they are, the more bothersome they can be"
10-03-2018T23:11:10,Dadrobit,10% off! Score.
10-03-2018T23:11:10,Vatruvius,"To be honest, I feel like some women purposely choose a bra to create a distraction. Like, why?"
10-03-2018T23:11:12,unsteddyphoenix,also the harder they fall
10-03-2018T23:11:30,Twokinds,The pocket dimension provides very good support.
10-03-2018T23:11:41,Dadrobit,Probably the same reason I go out wearing shirts that are a bit too small.
10-03-2018T23:11:44,Vatruvius,Confirmed.
10-03-2018T23:11:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Well I’m moving then
10-03-2018T23:12:06,unsteddyphoenix,Good for Nat.
10-03-2018T23:12:09,Vatruvius,Moving?
10-03-2018T23:12:15,Dadrobit,Literally a distraction.
10-03-2018T23:12:18,Vatruvius,Into the TwoKinds world?
10-03-2018T23:12:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you mean push up and pumped bras, they’re worn for show, yes"
10-03-2018T23:14:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Then again moving also may not be the best idea
10-03-2018T23:14:11,Vatruvius,"Okay, perhaps a bra is not what I mean. The shirts some women wear. Like...I like breasts but I rather look at the person then be distracted by something just a few inches below their chin."
10-03-2018T23:14:39,unsteddyphoenix,This sounds more like a YOU problem
10-03-2018T23:14:43,Vatruvius,"As much as a good guy I think I am, I swear that sometimes my eye has a mind of its own."
10-03-2018T23:14:57,Vatruvius,****it...
10-03-2018T23:15:07,Dadrobit,"Simple solution, don't enjoy breasts."
10-03-2018T23:15:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"Yes some are made and worn to show off, but some women do it to show off and others do it because they like how they look and want to be able to wear what they please"
10-03-2018T23:15:39,Dadrobit,Maybe grow a beard and buy a fedora. Become the meme
10-03-2018T23:15:49,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao I was thinking that too dad
10-03-2018T23:16:03,Vatruvius,"Already have the beard, and I have a fedora in the closet."
10-03-2018T23:16:11,Dadrobit,LMAO
10-03-2018T23:16:14,unsteddyphoenix,Yeeesssss~
10-03-2018T23:16:42,unsteddyphoenix,"protip: women like it when you call them ""m'lady"", makes you seem classy"
10-03-2018T23:16:43,Dadrobit,"Actually choked on my drink, not a good time."
10-03-2018T23:17:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"Might creep some out, too"
10-03-2018T23:17:18,unsteddyphoenix,shhshshhhh...
10-03-2018T23:17:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Those are the one you may want to avoid
10-03-2018T23:18:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Someone actually did the m’lady thing to me once. We were having a renaissance day.
10-03-2018T23:18:08,Dadrobit,"Naw, the ones that you want to avoid are the ones that make you call them daddy"
10-03-2018T23:18:22,unsteddyphoenix,Huuh. Incorrect.
10-03-2018T23:18:30,Vatruvius,"M'lady huh...that really does not fit my personality. That would take someone with a huge ego or complete disregard for their image, definitely not me."
10-03-2018T23:18:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Changed my mind. That is the ones you avoid
10-03-2018T23:18:54,unsteddyphoenix,"Maan ya'll're wrong, those are the fun ones~"

10-03-2018T23:33:41,Dadrobit,I think I saw the second one.

10-03-2018T23:33:53,Twokinds,I don't remember
10-03-2018T23:34:18,Vatruvius,The second had the Noah's Arc thing going on.
10-03-2018T23:34:22,SpazztasticKiwi,She’s introduced in the third I think
10-03-2018T23:34:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Dawn of the Dinosaurs
10-03-2018T23:34:53,Dadrobit,I recall a musical break in there somewhere?
10-03-2018T23:35:02,Dadrobit,Maybe I'm just thinking the first
10-03-2018T23:35:06,unsteddyphoenix,https://youtu.be/n0ykM1ALggE?t=33
10-03-2018T23:35:09,SpazztasticKiwi,They dance in a fight over the acorn
10-03-2018T23:35:16,unsteddyphoenix,"Ok, the furries are taking over tbh"
10-03-2018T23:35:49,SpazztasticKiwi,How old would you guys say you are mentally?
10-03-2018T23:36:05,SpazztasticKiwi,In all seriousness
10-03-2018T23:36:07,Dadrobit,"Awwwww, it's a sugar glider"
10-03-2018T23:36:17,unsteddyphoenix,I feel like there's some undertones in that question...
10-03-2018T23:37:31,Dadrobit,"Ah, I was thinking of the melon fight scene in the first I think."
10-03-2018T23:37:39,Vatruvius,Wow...how is that a good use of company time?
10-03-2018T23:37:51,Twokinds,I don't know how mental age is defined
10-03-2018T23:38:02,Dadrobit,Kind of an odd question honestly.
10-03-2018T23:38:03,unsteddyphoenix,It's kind of a nothing question
10-03-2018T23:38:09,unsteddyphoenix,aha
10-03-2018T23:38:56,unsteddyphoenix,"There needs to be a comparable standard set, at least."
10-03-2018T23:38:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"You don’t identify with the teenagers that walk into McDonald’s like apes, do you - throwing fries and talking loud as possible?"
10-03-2018T23:39:09,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s a good measurement
10-03-2018T23:39:20,Vatruvius,I...I don't go to McDonald's
10-03-2018T23:39:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Of course you can also take a mental age test
10-03-2018T23:39:34,Vatruvius,Neither do I throw food
10-03-2018T23:39:37,unsteddyphoenix,I would never throw fries!
10-03-2018T23:39:45,Twokinds,Fries are not to be wasted
10-03-2018T23:39:53,Dadrobit,"Yeah, but throwing food and yelling is toddler age stuff."
10-03-2018T23:40:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Well you’re all at least over 18 then
10-03-2018T23:40:33,unsteddyphoenix,Unless those teens had a lower mental age than their age
10-03-2018T23:40:34,Dadrobit,But that doesn't mean I don't enjoy Little Big Planet and watching The Lion King.
10-03-2018T23:40:51,Vatruvius,^
10-03-2018T23:40:54,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve seen some boys come into my McDonald’s and act like that. Toddlers is accurate
10-03-2018T23:41:44,Dadrobit,Whilst sipping a bourbon and sitting in a stream with a half naked furry on my screen.
10-03-2018T23:41:47,Vatruvius,"I think that is the norm, so when you are looking for people who have an older mental age basically means your are looking for people who have some measure of responsibility in their lives."
10-03-2018T23:42:02,unsteddyphoenix,thats some multitasking dad
10-03-2018T23:42:08,SpazztasticKiwi,One of them asked for my phone number and I had to resist telling him I don’t babysit
10-03-2018T23:42:21,unsteddyphoenix,What the hell why would you resist that
10-03-2018T23:42:30,Dadrobit,Dedication to mixed messages.
10-03-2018T23:42:40,unsteddyphoenix,Can you go back and lie and tell me that's what you said to them thanks
10-03-2018T23:42:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I just told him I was married so I could get on with my life
10-03-2018T23:42:47,Twokinds,"I am pretty much the same as I was even 10 years ago, except perhaps a little better at drawing and investing money."
10-03-2018T23:42:59,unsteddyphoenix,Just a little
10-03-2018T23:43:24,unsteddyphoenix,"But yeah, I thought i'd be like...idk growing out of video games and the like."
10-03-2018T23:43:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I forget you’re 30 sometimes
10-03-2018T23:43:33,unsteddyphoenix,"But nah, I dont feel like ive changed in a while"
10-03-2018T23:44:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don’t think I have either. Someone did tell me once that they thought I was 25, and I was only 20"
10-03-2018T23:44:34,Vatruvius,I doubt I will ever grow out of video games...I think that is just going to be a part of my life. I think growing up really is just proving you can manage to survive in this world without help.
10-03-2018T23:44:36,Dadrobit,Feel like I'm 50. Pulled a muscle in my neck dancing earlier and now it's turned into a great headache...
10-03-2018T23:44:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Good job
10-03-2018T23:45:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Give him a hand folks
10-03-2018T23:45:03,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha d'aww~
10-03-2018T23:45:07,Vatruvius,Why are you dancing @Dadrobit
10-03-2018T23:45:11,unsteddyphoenix,:clap::clap::clap:
10-03-2018T23:45:14,Vatruvius,:clap::clap::clap:
10-03-2018T23:45:18,Dadrobit,Because I'm white Vat.
10-03-2018T23:45:31,unsteddyphoenix,"No, thats the reason you injured yourself"
10-03-2018T23:45:45,Dadrobit,Fair. Point to unsteddy
10-03-2018T23:45:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’m all for a little fun - it’s what keeps you young, but I figure I’m grown where it matters"
10-03-2018T23:46:56,SpazztasticKiwi,My bank advisor said my banking skills are older than me
10-03-2018T23:47:00,Dadrobit,I'm a grown up where it matters too. I have a cabinet with Ibuprofen.
10-03-2018T23:47:08,Dadrobit,That's kind of grown up
10-03-2018T23:47:08,unsteddyphoenix,Apparently you dont start physically growing until 25ish
10-03-2018T23:47:12,unsteddyphoenix,*stop
10-03-2018T23:47:48,Vatruvius,"Honestly, I feel like growing up in some aspects sucks but I also hope that eventually I can meet people who are not ""toddlers"" as you describe them Kiwi. My high school life was nothing but classes and college classes at the same time."
10-03-2018T23:47:55,SpazztasticKiwi,There is a section of your skull that doesn’t fuse together till 24
10-03-2018T23:48:14,Vatruvius,"I had some good friends but now that we all split up after graduating I am surrounded by ""idiots."""
10-03-2018T23:49:00,Dadrobit,":( Lost some close friends right out of high school, I know that feel."
10-03-2018T23:49:00,SpazztasticKiwi,After high school I found a few people grew brains in my class
10-03-2018T23:49:39,Vatruvius,"Like, grew college brains?"
10-03-2018T23:49:56,SpazztasticKiwi,More like some better general intelligence
10-03-2018T23:50:13,unsteddyphoenix,common sense?
10-03-2018T23:50:15,SpazztasticKiwi,One dude thought birth control could stop a pregnancy
10-03-2018T23:50:25,SpazztasticKiwi,You tell me
10-03-2018T23:50:26,Vatruvius,Why...
10-03-2018T23:50:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Needless to say he has a daughter now
10-03-2018T23:51:51,Vatruvius,"I mean, you could imagine growing up in an early college high school setting with only 40 people in your entire grade but even then only a few were like me and didn't act stupid. That is why I identify as a nerd, puts it straight out there who I am."
10-03-2018T23:51:51,Dadrobit,No babies
10-03-2018T23:52:15,SpazztasticKiwi,This is why we need sex ed
10-03-2018T23:52:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause stupid can unfortunately breed
10-03-2018T23:52:52,unsteddyphoenix,Stupid breeds more than smart nowadays
10-03-2018T23:53:15,Vatruvius,Stupid breads Stupid
10-03-2018T23:53:54,Vatruvius,Only reason they live is because we have excellent medicine.
10-03-2018T23:54:02,unsteddyphoenix,It breads them everywhere
10-03-2018T23:54:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Because smart likes to stay indoors and talk with other smart on the internet
10-03-2018T23:54:40,Vatruvius,I will take that compliment! :D
10-03-2018T23:54:51,unsteddyphoenix,"Because ""smart"" are too worried about their livelyhood to risk the expense"
10-03-2018T23:55:16,unsteddyphoenix,*livelihood
10-03-2018T23:55:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Why are we talking about ourselves in the third person
10-03-2018T23:55:29,unsteddyphoenix,Naw im dumb as hell
10-03-2018T23:55:35,unsteddyphoenix,Just hate kids :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
10-03-2018T23:55:46,Dadrobit,:EvalsOkay:
10-03-2018T23:55:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t hate them - just not a fan of them
10-03-2018T23:55:53,Vatruvius,:ptv-shock:
10-03-2018T23:56:20,SpazztasticKiwi,My mother fawns over every small child she sees though
10-03-2018T23:56:40,Vatruvius,That is because she had a kid and wants more. My mom is the same.
10-03-2018T23:57:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Well she’ll be waiting awhile if she wants grandkids
10-03-2018T23:57:13,Vatruvius,"I like kids and all, but I am just smart enough to know that I should get my life in order before I ever bring someone else into it. That would just be irresponsible."
10-03-2018T23:57:27,unsteddyphoenix,Lol my mum so sad that neither me or my sister want kids
10-03-2018T23:58:40,Vatruvius,"As I get older my mom wants me to get into a relationship as soon as possible to get grandkids. Like...calm down...I know it has bee 18 years since I was ""cute"" but you will have to wait a few more years."
10-03-2018T23:59:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’m not in a terrible hurry for pregnancy. In fact, I’m considering taking a pass on it"
10-03-2018T23:59:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Takes two to tango anyway
