22-10-2018T14:06:48,TerraTheWizard,"mentions a part 3, that lying around anywhere or has it been lost to time?"
22-10-2018T14:15:14,Bgrmystr2,yeah I don't think he ever got around to drawing 3
22-10-2018T14:19:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"“That’s for later” - Tom, probably"

22-10-2018T14:25:55,BadFoMo,I think I remember him saying that part 3 was going to have Musclehead falling off the bridge.
22-10-2018T14:26:26,SpazztasticKiwi,That reminds me I’m ready for lunch
22-10-2018T14:28:47,Mippy,I’m having lunch...then I got to go study for my midterm before my next class
22-10-2018T14:29:54,Mippy,I don’t know if we talked about this but did MuscleHead ever get a real name?
22-10-2018T14:34:10,Dadrobit,"IIRC, him falling to his death wasn't part 3, falling to his death was just actually going to be his canon demise."
22-10-2018T14:38:18,Mippy,Instead he had to suffer one of the most brutal and undeserved deaths we’ve had. :ctwokinds-LauraCry:
22-10-2018T14:40:42,TerraTheWizard,'sploded
22-10-2018T14:42:01,Mippy,:boom:
22-10-2018T14:43:53,Dadrobit,Yeah. And never even brought up again. Not even at the trial.
22-10-2018T14:50:27,Mippy,I hope his family at least mourned (and or celebrated ) for him
22-10-2018T14:52:12,Dadrobit,I think there was a casket on the chapter title page?
22-10-2018T14:53:14,Dadrobit,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/530/ 3 caskets and the king on a slab
22-10-2018T14:53:22,Dadrobit,Spoiler alert: She got better.
22-10-2018T14:53:35,TerraTheWizard,lol
22-10-2018T14:55:29,Bgrmystr2,"lot more than 3 ppl died, but yeah"
22-10-2018T14:56:25,Dadrobit,3 generals and the king is the implied sentiment
22-10-2018T14:58:05,Mippy,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/579/   Someone cared enough to put something on his Casket
22-10-2018T14:59:22,Mippy,It’s been a while since I read the trial
22-10-2018T15:00:21,TerraTheWizard,the sketch page of that with natani instead of keith XD

22-10-2018T15:14:08,Mippy,Besides...I’d probably look for some Basitin hotness that has not been coloured
22-10-2018T15:20:11,kts,that's an interesting idea
22-10-2018T15:23:12,Mippy,It’s a best idea
22-10-2018T16:13:09,Xexanoth,"speaking of basitins, the flower crown one isn't colored...it's more cuteness than hotness though"
22-10-2018T16:17:12,Mippy,I love that one. So cute
22-10-2018T16:17:24,Dadrobit,"I mean, not that I'm biased or anything, but if you're looking for a good looking Basitin, Keith's turned it up to ""broil"" in Basitin Dinner."
22-10-2018T16:17:48,Dadrobit,Definitely not biased towards that one.
22-10-2018T16:35:31,Mippy,Ooohhh! Dad you are right. I love when Keith looks a bit scruffy ( adds to personal collection)
22-10-2018T16:41:59,Bgrmystr2,"""not bias"" Prolly suggested by dadro"
22-10-2018T17:01:30,Xexanoth,"""Prolly"", totaly not the one he suggested for months"
22-10-2018T17:03:04,Dadrobit,7 months. But no one's counting really.
22-10-2018T17:12:50,Bgrmystr2,sounds like you're counting.
22-10-2018T17:38:48,Dadrobit,"Currently, I'm blubbering like a fucking idiot actually. Violet Evergarden Episode 7 can go fuck itself with it's own fucking emotional manipulations!"
22-10-2018T17:53:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Colorful
22-10-2018T18:08:32,Dadrobit,"Ya don't get it. I had JUST gotten home from helping out pops at his shop. Using big machines, doin' a bit of welding, a bit of cutting, throwin 'round big old pieces of steel."
22-10-2018T18:08:41,Dadrobit,And just generally doing shit that helps reassure myself that I am in fact at least a little manly.
22-10-2018T18:08:54,Dadrobit,Then I get home and this anime....
22-10-2018T18:09:00,Dadrobit,This. Fuckin'. Anime.
22-10-2018T18:09:17,Dadrobit,Goes and makes me its bitch in 20 minutes flat.

22-10-2018T18:24:07,Combak,"So, no stream tonight."
22-10-2018T18:24:19,Combak,Is Tom planning to pick all of them this week?
22-10-2018T18:24:26,Combak,Cause I'd be cool with that. XD
22-10-2018T18:25:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom has been mia for the past 24ish hours
22-10-2018T18:25:53,Combak,I see...
22-10-2018T18:25:55,SpazztasticKiwi,We’re basically entertaining ourselves behind his back rn
22-10-2018T18:25:59,Combak,"Well, he could use the rest. XD"
22-10-2018T18:26:02,Bgrmystr2,Tom hasn't been here so we have no news besides what he said before.
22-10-2018T18:26:11,Combak,Which was...?
22-10-2018T18:26:19,Bgrmystr2,that he'll figure it out.
22-10-2018T18:26:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Backflips. He’s working on his backflips
22-10-2018T18:26:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Totally

22-10-2018T21:39:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom finally got the anniversary thing on instagram!
22-10-2018T21:39:40,SpazztasticKiwi,And basically the only thing my eyes went to was the lil peekaboo
22-10-2018T21:43:10,Bgrmystr2,tom has an instagram?
22-10-2018T21:43:13,Bgrmystr2,I'm not seeing it
22-10-2018T21:43:34,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-KatDance: hi
22-10-2018T21:43:41,Bgrmystr2,Hello
22-10-2018T21:48:28,Ordithus,"It is [insert time here], do you know where your [dependent creatures] are?"
22-10-2018T21:50:24,Bgrmystr2,"I am my own independent creature and it is 10 till 10, and I am here with myself."
22-10-2018T21:50:34,Bgrmystr2,I am safe.
22-10-2018T21:50:40,Ordithus,Very good
22-10-2018T21:55:28,SpazztasticKiwi,The Instagram is just TwoKinds
22-10-2018T21:56:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve never seen a picture of Tom - it’s always been comic pieces and colored sketches
22-10-2018T21:59:36,Bgrmystr2,link? :o
22-10-2018T21:59:43,Bgrmystr2,cuz searching for it gives nothing
22-10-2018T22:00:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Then again I just went scrubbing through and found a picture of him so
22-10-2018T22:00:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Hold on I’ll link
22-10-2018T22:01:57,SpazztasticKiwi,https://instagram.com/two.kinds?utm_source=ig_profile_share&igshid=13oho4dqf6e2j
22-10-2018T22:02:51,Bgrmystr2,that's not tom
22-10-2018T22:04:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn’t say he did
22-10-2018T22:05:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Never really figured he ran it - seems a bit of a mess managing ALL the posting stuff
22-10-2018T22:05:45,Bgrmystr2,"you did say tom got it on instagram, so.. yeah. but that's not tom, cuz it's linking Neon's discord."
22-10-2018T22:06:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Uh huh
22-10-2018T22:06:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve followed it
22-10-2018T22:08:09,Ordithus,How does one acquire this old print????? https://www.instagram.com/p/BIaltlKgj7v/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet

22-10-2018T22:08:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"Oddly enough, discord still doesn’t ring with me too much - can’t really follow a conversation unless you’re there for hours"
22-10-2018T22:08:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I do want to see the results of the competition
22-10-2018T22:08:57,Bgrmystr2,"that's just the kat print, Ord"
22-10-2018T22:09:09,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I want that print so bad
22-10-2018T22:09:10,Bgrmystr2,and tom usually sells all the prints when he goes to conventions
22-10-2018T22:09:20,unsteddyphoenix,Orly? Even the past ones?
22-10-2018T22:09:25,Bgrmystr2,yah
22-10-2018T22:09:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Dat’s alot of paper
22-10-2018T22:09:47,Bgrmystr2,"it's not that hard, kiwi. I mean, how do you follow conversations here? same thing"
22-10-2018T22:10:00,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe I could get someone to get one for me...
22-10-2018T22:10:01,Bgrmystr2,ya just jump in
22-10-2018T22:10:02,Ordithus,Oh.  <3 https://www.instagram.com/p/8Jchhsv1vU/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet
22-10-2018T22:10:09,Ordithus,I might have to make it to a con
22-10-2018T22:10:26,unsteddyphoenix,Ay do it
22-10-2018T22:10:56,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
22-10-2018T22:10:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Like I’ve said - SDCC would be wonderful
22-10-2018T22:11:03,SpazztasticKiwi,But it far
22-10-2018T22:11:15,SpazztasticKiwi,And I have no idea if I’d get off work
22-10-2018T22:11:26,Bgrmystr2,and kiwi that contest ended already
22-10-2018T22:11:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I know
22-10-2018T22:11:36,Bgrmystr2,mkay then
22-10-2018T22:11:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m waiting to see if they’ll post pictures or whatever
22-10-2018T22:12:03,SpazztasticKiwi,See what won. All the stuff
22-10-2018T22:12:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, anyone know if there’s a Nibbly print"
22-10-2018T22:13:28,Bgrmystr2,I don't think there's a nibbly print like that.. yet
22-10-2018T22:15:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Well that’s a shame
22-10-2018T22:15:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also also, I’ve been considering what all other cons to try, like Tupelo con and such"
22-10-2018T22:16:47,Ordithus,"Do you guys know a decent video editor, hopefully free?  I don't need to do much with it.  Very basic editing"
22-10-2018T22:20:10,Bgrmystr2,nah I don't
22-10-2018T22:20:15,Bgrmystr2,I need to look for one
22-10-2018T22:20:32,Ordithus,I don't need to give my friend a 1.7 GB video...
22-10-2018T22:20:34,Bgrmystr2,the one that comes with windows seems fine on 7
22-10-2018T22:20:52,Bgrmystr2,"also, I've done that before"
22-10-2018T22:20:54,Bgrmystr2,several times
22-10-2018T22:21:54,Bgrmystr2,I can't when it passes 5gb but usually I don't need to transfer anything that large
22-10-2018T22:22:04,Bgrmystr2,"if I do, I split it with RAR or something"
22-10-2018T22:23:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Yeah I don’t have anything either other than something you may find standard on a computer
22-10-2018T22:24:15,Ordithus,The default software can't do much other than trim the length and put it into an absurdly low bitrate
22-10-2018T22:24:24,Ordithus,It even went from 60 fps to 30
22-10-2018T22:24:42,Bgrmystr2,does it? I don't think it messes with any of that
22-10-2018T22:24:55,Bgrmystr2,"but I dunno, maybe a newer version does."
22-10-2018T22:25:20,Ordithus,"Windows 10, the Photos application"
22-10-2018T22:25:30,Bgrmystr2,that'd be why
22-10-2018T22:25:50,Bgrmystr2,I'm on 7 and the movie maker that comes with it is pretty standard fare
22-10-2018T22:26:04,Ordithus,Curse you Microsoft!!!
22-10-2018T22:26:12,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-flomad:
22-10-2018T22:26:33,Bgrmystr2,you expected to have better than 7 by switching to 10? What a mistake that was.
22-10-2018T22:26:35,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
22-10-2018T22:30:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"If I had a dollar for everytime someone said 10 was garbage, I’d be able to fund a new version"
22-10-2018T22:30:46,Bgrmystr2,yes you would.
22-10-2018T22:31:15,Bgrmystr2,pity microsoft has a thousand times that and still does it wrong.
22-10-2018T22:34:09,Ordithus,Going to try out Adobe Media Encoder...
22-10-2018T22:40:50,SpazztasticKiwi,🙏🏻
22-10-2018T22:42:29,Ordithus,Haha 7 day free trial
22-10-2018T22:49:26,Ordithus,"Mistakes were made.  It will work, but this is beyond me."
22-10-2018T22:49:54,Bgrmystr2,xD rip
22-10-2018T22:52:11,Ordithus,I have not dipped my toes much in the world of video
22-10-2018T22:59:30,Ordithus,Success.  I will never do it this way again.
22-10-2018T23:01:13,SpazztasticKiwi,End goal acquired. Destroy the evidence
22-10-2018T23:01:25,Ordithus,:fire::ctwokinds-renirawr:
22-10-2018T23:07:08,Combak,Well then...
22-10-2018T23:07:10,Combak,Night all.
22-10-2018T23:07:40,Ordithus,night Combak
22-10-2018T23:13:28,Combak,Thanks Ord.
22-10-2018T23:35:24,Dadrobit,For future reference. Reaper and DaVinci Resolve are free programs that offer excellent video editing options.
22-10-2018T23:37:43,Dadrobit,"Technically, Reaper costs $60 so long as you make less than $20,000 a year using the program, but it has a ""I'm still evaluating"" option prompt every time you open the program that lets you ""evaluate"" it for free indefinitely."
22-10-2018T23:38:13,Ordithus,"$0 is less than $20,000"
22-10-2018T23:38:30,Bgrmystr2,sure is.
22-10-2018T23:39:41,Ordithus,Thanks!
22-10-2018T23:39:58,Bgrmystr2,"either one you'd recommend over the other for reasons, dadro? :o"
22-10-2018T23:42:17,Dadrobit,"Reaper is primarily an audio editing program that happens to have a happily extensive video editing suite. DR is hyper focused on the video editing part, but in its depths, a newcomer will find themselves very lost."
22-10-2018T23:43:50,Dadrobit,I obviously prefer Reaper for... obvious reasons. But it's also super nice in that it's very flexible in customization.
22-10-2018T23:44:23,Dadrobit,But both have great tutorials available for getting into their programs on YouTube.
22-10-2018T23:44:56,Bgrmystr2,"cool, good to know"
22-10-2018T23:44:57,Bgrmystr2,thanks
22-10-2018T23:44:57,Ordithus,Nice.  I'm sure I'll have more videos in the future
