13-10-2018T08:10:31,Twokinds,League game?
13-10-2018T08:11:25,Dadrobit,of Legends. World championship games this month
13-10-2018T08:12:22,iliar,"Good morning. Yes, I woke up few minutes ago. But I can not say that 4PM is early."
13-10-2018T08:12:46,Dadrobit,Some ridiculously good games are being played.
13-10-2018T08:13:13,Twokinds,OH I see!
13-10-2018T08:15:07,Dadrobit,North American team Cloud9 is fighting for a place in at least the top 8 of the world after at one point being last place in the North American series earlier in the season. Very hype storyline going on for them.
13-10-2018T08:40:55,unsteddyphoenix,I should be sleeping buuuut im watching some of these games
13-10-2018T08:41:01,unsteddyphoenix,:upside_down:
13-10-2018T08:41:38,unsteddyphoenix,Btw Tom I noticed in the stream vod that you did some of the kat/flora bathing redraw sketch.
13-10-2018T08:41:59,unsteddyphoenix,Did you finish it or should I re-req it for the finish
13-10-2018T08:43:20,Twokinds,"I haven't finished it yet, but I do intend to"
13-10-2018T08:43:49,Twokinds,"Actually, a Nora Card holder coincidentally also requested a remake of that specific drawing."
13-10-2018T08:44:04,Twokinds,"So if you want to suggest something else, that's fine."
13-10-2018T08:44:18,iliar,You mean this? https://yadi.sk/i/k0mYesY4N7syEQ
13-10-2018T08:48:22,iliar,"So, remakes is allowed... Hm... I need to think it over. Can the Nora Card been used to make a remake of the frame from the page?"
13-10-2018T08:49:07,unsteddyphoenix,"oh hey cool, how convenient"
13-10-2018T08:50:09,unsteddyphoenix,"nah, this"

13-10-2018T08:50:13,Twokinds,"I don't see why not, iliar"
13-10-2018T08:51:00,iliar,Nice!
13-10-2018T08:51:44,iliar,I suddenly noticed that Tom often draws Flora in a very similar pose. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/359539122496339968/501026299712765952/FlorasPose.jpg
13-10-2018T08:58:51,Twokinds,Heh yes
13-10-2018T08:59:00,Twokinds,It's a good pose!
13-10-2018T09:02:12,Twokinds,I have four hours to draw an entire comic.
13-10-2018T09:03:37,unsteddyphoenix,the third ones fairly distinct
13-10-2018T09:03:54,unsteddyphoenix,Woah youre gonna try before the stream? good luck
13-10-2018T09:03:58,unsteddyphoenix,damn
13-10-2018T09:04:25,Twokinds,Might as well give it a shot
13-10-2018T09:04:31,Twokinds,There's some time before it starts
13-10-2018T09:07:34,iliar,"The ability to remake frames from old pages opens up so many new features. It looks like Nora Cards have unlimited power. But to limit their power, Tom draws Nora Cards very slowly."
13-10-2018T09:08:24,iliar,Unlimited power artifact must have some flaw.
13-10-2018T09:09:06,Twokinds,"Speaking of Nora Cards, do you mind if I post Colin today?"
13-10-2018T09:11:16,unsteddyphoenix,Well good luck. im gonna get a lil' sleep.
13-10-2018T09:11:19,iliar,Well ... it will break my idea with week of Nora Cards. But I do not mind.
13-10-2018T09:11:24,unsteddyphoenix,"brb, i guess?"
13-10-2018T09:13:55,Twokinds,bye

13-10-2018T14:54:10,AFallingTree,I didn’t think it was possible to sleep with caffeine in ur system

13-10-2018T19:48:54,SomeDudeNamedQ,thanks for the stream!
13-10-2018T19:49:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Hello possible new person
13-10-2018T19:49:53,TheBeckoner,What kinda news Kiwi?
13-10-2018T19:49:56,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floraquestion:
13-10-2018T19:50:16,SpazztasticKiwi,The guy that’s been asking about me at work may not be gone
13-10-2018T19:50:28,TheBeckoner,Oh the creepr guy right?
13-10-2018T19:50:29,Ordithus,wellshit
13-10-2018T19:50:31,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s been a white truck following my car
13-10-2018T19:50:35,TheBeckoner,creeper*
13-10-2018T19:50:41,TheBeckoner,uh oh
13-10-2018T19:51:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t know if it’s the same person and I’ve yet to catch a look at the driver
13-10-2018T19:51:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"But my mom, who drives the same car I use, has noticed the truck too"
13-10-2018T19:52:29,Ordithus,the hell
13-10-2018T19:52:51,Bgrmystr2,thaaaat's a stalker
13-10-2018T19:52:55,Ordithus,get mace
13-10-2018T19:52:56,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m very close to seeking a pistol for the car
13-10-2018T19:53:00,Ordithus,stay safe
13-10-2018T19:53:03,Bgrmystr2,somethin you should probably contact authorities
13-10-2018T19:53:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I have mace and a stun gun
13-10-2018T19:53:25,Ordithus,also check your laws
13-10-2018T19:53:32,Bgrmystr2,yeah that too
13-10-2018T19:53:53,Bgrmystr2,do a doubletake on any stalking laws in your state :U
13-10-2018T19:54:08,Bgrmystr2,as well as self-defense
13-10-2018T19:55:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"I have a suspicion on the truck. If I catch another good look at it, it may be this guy whose address I know"
13-10-2018T19:56:10,SpazztasticKiwi,A bit of a spoiled guy that likes messing with people
13-10-2018T19:57:30,Bgrmystr2,you can't go wrong with going to a police station and letting them know that there's someone that's been following your vehicle on a constant basis
13-10-2018T19:57:49,Ordithus,Even if they can't do anything at the time
13-10-2018T19:58:16,Bgrmystr2,"yeah even if they can't do anything, they'll be able to tell you what to do"
13-10-2018T19:59:05,microbuss,nutso
13-10-2018T19:59:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"It’s not terribly constant. Just enough it’s been noticed, and whoever it is doesn’t seem to know I’m not the only driver, if they’re even after me and it’s not just some dick with wheels"
13-10-2018T20:00:06,Ordithus,though maaaybe it's just someone who drives a similar route at similar times
13-10-2018T20:00:14,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, it could be coincidence"
13-10-2018T20:00:16,Ordithus,tho i don't know
13-10-2018T20:00:29,SpazztasticKiwi,1-2 feet from my car’s rear?
13-10-2018T20:00:37,Ordithus,Ah
13-10-2018T20:00:40,Bgrmystr2,but similar route w/ similar times is still pretty hard-pressed for you to see the same car every time
13-10-2018T20:01:06,Bgrmystr2,"just an in general thing, even if you leave at the same time, you won't always see the same person due to driving habits"
13-10-2018T20:01:15,Bgrmystr2,and people won't follow or keep pace with others
13-10-2018T20:01:28,Bgrmystr2,"so when someone IS keeping pace or following you, it's blatantly noticable"
13-10-2018T20:01:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Mom said they followed her reeeal close from town
13-10-2018T20:01:59,Ordithus,"Yeah, not normal"
13-10-2018T20:02:54,SpazztasticKiwi,And it’s a rule for me to make sure there’s no one on either side of the road within sight when I pull onto my road coming home
13-10-2018T20:05:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"Whoever it is hasn’t shown they know my schedule though, as evidenced by never asking about me when I’m at work, but appears to know my car"
13-10-2018T20:05:32,AFallingTree,I’ll be able to watch a full stream one of these days
13-10-2018T20:05:46,AFallingTree,Maybe when I finish my painful amounts of study
13-10-2018T20:06:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Study study study
13-10-2018T20:06:02,Bgrmystr2,"they probably don't want to ask about you, Kiwi"
13-10-2018T20:06:08,Bgrmystr2,cuz that could raise flags
13-10-2018T20:06:25,Ordithus,as if following super close wouldn't...
13-10-2018T20:06:33,Bgrmystr2,yeah but
13-10-2018T20:06:38,Ordithus,yeah
13-10-2018T20:06:42,Bgrmystr2,they wouldn't connect THAT person
13-10-2018T20:06:46,Bgrmystr2,with the same person following
13-10-2018T20:06:59,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s how this whole thing started: my manager mentioned to me an unknown man had been coming in a few times a week asking if I was there/when I’d be there
13-10-2018T20:07:03,Bgrmystr2,unless they start asking a buncha questions during the same timeframe
13-10-2018T20:07:20,Bgrmystr2,"yeah see, and that combined with the following raises flags"
13-10-2018T20:07:32,Bgrmystr2,"that's why if they're not askin questions, they're trying to avoid flags"
13-10-2018T20:07:35,ZahnHolley,Awwwh damnit i missed toms stream again! >.>
13-10-2018T20:07:47,Ordithus,but... you were there
13-10-2018T20:07:48,Bgrmystr2,weren't you just here earlier?
13-10-2018T20:08:01,Bgrmystr2,yeah you were there bro
13-10-2018T20:08:02,SpazztasticKiwi,No one is allowed to tell anyone who just asks about another employee to give that information
13-10-2018T20:08:14,ZahnHolley,But not the whole thing
13-10-2018T20:08:36,Bgrmystr2,well stop leavin to do stuff
13-10-2018T20:08:40,Bgrmystr2,and you'll be there
13-10-2018T20:08:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Same. Mine wouldn’t really load and I tried a smol nap
13-10-2018T20:09:06,TheBeckoner,Did the nap fix it?
13-10-2018T20:09:19,ZahnHolley,Im sorry i was busy elsewhere XD
13-10-2018T20:09:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I awoke to the end
13-10-2018T20:09:32,TheBeckoner,ah thats the problem with naps
13-10-2018T20:09:36,TheBeckoner,they consume time points
13-10-2018T20:09:40,SpazztasticKiwi,But I have a sandwich and kitty to pet
13-10-2018T20:09:56,Ordithus,sounds nice~
13-10-2018T20:10:02,SpazztasticKiwi,And I got a free milkshake
13-10-2018T20:10:12,TheBeckoner,You pet your sandwiches?
13-10-2018T20:10:16,TheBeckoner,I usually eat mine
13-10-2018T20:10:17,ZahnHolley,Lucky!
13-10-2018T20:10:20,Twokinds,I'm craving takis so bad right now

13-10-2018T20:10:43,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s like 9 for you - maybe it’s still possible
13-10-2018T20:10:45,TheBeckoner,You posses currency and vehicle
13-10-2018T20:11:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Go forth an acquire your craving
13-10-2018T20:11:06,Twokinds,Yeah but that would require effort...
13-10-2018T20:11:09,Twokinds,And pants
13-10-2018T20:11:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Ew pants
13-10-2018T20:11:24,TheBeckoner,pants are optional in some places
13-10-2018T20:11:27,Ordithus,You stream without pants :ptv-confused:
13-10-2018T20:11:32,TheBeckoner,use shorts or something

13-10-2018T20:11:53,Bgrmystr2,lol shorts are the best not-pants
13-10-2018T20:11:55,Twokinds,I don't have anything spicy
13-10-2018T20:11:55,Dadrobit,Just in time I see
13-10-2018T20:12:10,Ordithus,"wb robit, as always, your timing is impeccable"
13-10-2018T20:12:18,Dadrobit,Tom. Not wearing pants is the definition of spicy.
13-10-2018T20:12:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m sure they’ve seen plenty a customer without pants
13-10-2018T20:12:24,Bgrmystr2,hahaha
13-10-2018T20:12:26,Ordithus,lol
13-10-2018T20:12:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Or ask for a male driver
13-10-2018T20:12:28,Bgrmystr2,classic dadro
13-10-2018T20:12:30,w0lfmare,You have fire
13-10-2018T20:12:31,TheBeckoner,Shorts are good. I have like 20 pairs of shorts and like 3 pairs of pants
13-10-2018T20:12:38,w0lfmare,Is that close enough?
13-10-2018T20:13:02,Bgrmystr2,I don't wear pants unless it's cold or I need to be dressy..
13-10-2018T20:13:10,Dadrobit,"Also, sour about that 10th place finish. Here's hoping a minimum of thirst-bait in the vote next time."
13-10-2018T20:13:10,Bgrmystr2,and I usually avoid going to dressy stuff.
13-10-2018T20:13:12,CommanderTrace,i'm just reading your comic again Tom im at page 142
13-10-2018T20:13:12,TheBeckoner,Use alchemy to transmute some takis
13-10-2018T20:13:13,Twokinds,Did you know there's only 1 sketch in the entire patreon that has Red but not Raine as well?
13-10-2018T20:13:13,TheBeckoner,easy
13-10-2018T20:13:17,Ordithus,w0lf!  Nice to see the Ember and Sil piece finished :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
13-10-2018T20:13:25,Twokinds,ALL the other ones have Raine in it with him.
13-10-2018T20:13:26,Ordithus,"wow, Tom"
13-10-2018T20:13:33,Ordithus,Poor guy

13-10-2018T20:14:24,w0lfmare,It seems I found a Sunday sketch that didn't make it to Patreon
13-10-2018T20:14:28,unsteddyphoenix,Is the single non-Raine pic of fem-keidran red or something
13-10-2018T20:14:34,CommanderTrace,nooo
13-10-2018T20:14:38,unsteddyphoenix,Oh? Proof?
13-10-2018T20:14:42,Dadrobit,Not gonna be around for terribly long myself. Got some burgers in the wings to be grilled.

13-10-2018T20:15:08,SpazztasticKiwi,You know if you like trying spicy stuff we sell an Italian sandwich with a pepper sauce at Walmart
13-10-2018T20:15:10,Ordithus,Red no Raine
13-10-2018T20:15:10,CommanderTrace,Good night /morning ZahnHolley

13-10-2018T20:15:42,w0lfmare,"It's in the preview image for the saved stream, so it caught my eye"
13-10-2018T20:15:49,unsteddyphoenix,Huh.
13-10-2018T20:16:21,Dadrobit,Spicy stuff is a good time. Local wing joint makes their own ghost pepper sauce that's fucking nuts. It's so good.
13-10-2018T20:16:42,Ordithus,"Good catch, w0lf"
13-10-2018T20:16:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I like the Italian sandwich ok but I don’t add a whole bunch of the sauce
13-10-2018T20:17:52,SpazztasticKiwi,We also sell hot wings and a spicy chicken sandwich with its own spicy breading and spicy sauce packet
13-10-2018T20:18:13,Bgrmystr2,Did tom ever finish that image?
13-10-2018T20:18:29,w0lfmare,doesn't look like it?
13-10-2018T20:18:32,Dadrobit,I think that was a page that was giving him creative issues no?
13-10-2018T20:18:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Lots of people love the hot wings. But there’s this only lady who’ll special order hers with “only half the sauce”
13-10-2018T20:18:49,w0lfmare,I won't bother Tom with it then
13-10-2018T20:19:16,CommanderTrace,Did you know this song Tom ma
13-10-2018T20:19:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Art brain fart 🧠 💨

13-10-2018T20:19:33,CommanderTrace,Maybe it's something for your stream
13-10-2018T20:20:01,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, it's still worth asking tom about"
13-10-2018T20:20:13,Bgrmystr2,even if it's something he's not sure how to draw lol
13-10-2018T20:20:57,Twokinds,I never did finish it
13-10-2018T20:21:05,Twokinds,I wasn't happy with how it was coming out
13-10-2018T20:21:28,Bgrmystr2,"well, now we know."
13-10-2018T20:21:37,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, it is one of those lore questions so.."
13-10-2018T20:22:00,Bgrmystr2,it's not just a generic what if that you can just doodle willy nilly so I understand
13-10-2018T20:22:03,Dadrobit,WellThereItIsJeffGoldblum.png
13-10-2018T20:22:16,w0lfmare,As long as I saw what was on the stream I missed :cw0lfmare-KiaHalo:
13-10-2018T20:22:47,Ordithus,"The suggestion was ""How rose & trace first met"""
13-10-2018T20:22:56,SpazztasticKiwi,So what is the plan for food while pantsless
13-10-2018T20:23:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Delivery or suck it up and make something yourself
13-10-2018T20:23:15,Twokinds,The issue was I never had any real idea of how they met
13-10-2018T20:23:22,Twokinds,And it's hard to come up with something on the spot.
13-10-2018T20:23:25,Ordithus,"So, plenty of leeway for you if you ever do decide that"
13-10-2018T20:23:40,Ordithus,"Yeah, understandable"
13-10-2018T20:23:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Trace accidentally elbowed her at a drink shop and took her to dinner to apologize
13-10-2018T20:23:55,LannAF,Here's the answer
13-10-2018T20:24:00,LannAF,*Magic*

13-10-2018T20:24:45,LannAF,Heya Wolf
13-10-2018T20:24:50,w0lfmare,Hi o/
13-10-2018T20:24:55,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, I really do like the lore questions, but they're also way more difficult"
13-10-2018T20:24:57,LannAF,I came to this tab to close the stream but I was surprised to see people still talking.
13-10-2018T20:25:06,Bgrmystr2,"well, don't be surprised"
13-10-2018T20:25:10,Ordithus,we never leave
13-10-2018T20:25:13,Bgrmystr2,people talk in this chat well into the night
13-10-2018T20:25:14,Bgrmystr2,we live here.
13-10-2018T20:25:19,LannAF,weird.
13-10-2018T20:25:27,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s always someone here
13-10-2018T20:25:28,Bgrmystr2,it's actually fairly common :P
13-10-2018T20:25:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Lurking

13-10-2018T20:25:48,Dadrobit,"That's why I'm always iffy on the suggestions that are like ""How did Maddie's parents meet?"""
13-10-2018T20:25:51,LannAF,I'm bored as frick so I guess I'm one of the weirdos now
13-10-2018T20:26:03,Ordithus,one of us one of us
13-10-2018T20:26:05,LannAF,My girlfriend is reformatting her computer so we can't play games
13-10-2018T20:26:06,Dadrobit,"As much as I like lore, sketch streams seem like the worst place to source it from."
13-10-2018T20:26:39,LannAF,"I always thought sketch streams were very non-canon, and if any canon images came about, it was due to writing already being there for it"
13-10-2018T20:26:43,SpazztasticKiwi,“Hey come up with a whole backstory so you can draw this one sketch”
13-10-2018T20:26:45,LannAF,Which may make sense as to why it wasn't done
13-10-2018T20:26:47,w0lfmare,"My power was out for 4 days. It's back, but I still don't have internet XD"
13-10-2018T20:26:52,unsteddyphoenix,it can be a difficult thing to summarise in a sketch sometimes
13-10-2018T20:26:55,Bgrmystr2,"what a coincidence, I'm helping a friend reformatt her pc right now."
13-10-2018T20:27:03,Ordithus,The how are you here :ctwokinds-floraquestion:
13-10-2018T20:27:04,Twokinds,I hate power outages
13-10-2018T20:27:08,Twokinds,We get them so often
13-10-2018T20:27:12,LannAF,move here Tom
13-10-2018T20:27:13,Dadrobit,w0lf has solutions
13-10-2018T20:27:21,LannAF,move in with Sticky and me
13-10-2018T20:27:25,LannAF,I'll only yell half the time
13-10-2018T20:27:26,Twokinds,ok
13-10-2018T20:27:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Just move states. Easy
13-10-2018T20:27:32,Dadrobit,He sacrifices an Ember to the internet gods every 3 hours.
13-10-2018T20:27:43,LannAF,and we don't have dogs that bark
13-10-2018T20:27:46,LannAF,xD
13-10-2018T20:27:46,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-LauraCry: not Ember
13-10-2018T20:27:49,Bgrmystr2,"lol Lann there's no rhyme or reason to the suggestions, Lore or not. It's not based on anything, just questions from the community. Sometimes there's backing, sometimes there isn't."
13-10-2018T20:27:51,Dadrobit,Which is fine for him honestly. Just helps with his quota
13-10-2018T20:28:04,w0lfmare,:cw0lfmare-HeadSil::cw0lfmare-EmberSad::cw0lfmare-HeadAriah1:
13-10-2018T20:28:05,Bgrmystr2,so we get instances where there's just.. nothing to go on lol
13-10-2018T20:28:26,LannAF,That's basically what I was getting at BGR.
13-10-2018T20:28:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Oddly enough there’s not many outside dogs around here either
13-10-2018T20:28:30,Ordithus,We have had quite a few lore sketches though
13-10-2018T20:28:40,LannAF,People expecting deep lore based on non-canon questions will be sorely disappointed
13-10-2018T20:28:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless you live in one of the neighborhoods
13-10-2018T20:28:46,Dadrobit,"Personally, I choose to believe that Adelaide married the person she was smashing with the cart drawn horse on the day of ascension."
13-10-2018T20:28:46,LannAF,"And Tom, don't feel pressured -to- answer"
13-10-2018T20:28:49,Ordithus,"Though maybe those are more obvious, or were already described?"
13-10-2018T20:29:14,Ordithus,"Madelyn was a virgin birth, robit"
13-10-2018T20:29:14,Bgrmystr2,xD Dadro that was one of the best lore sketches I've seen
13-10-2018T20:29:40,Dadrobit,"""One day, Maddie just stopped hiding, and came into being."""
13-10-2018T20:29:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Maddie was a Jesus baby? We’re doomed
13-10-2018T20:30:06,Ordithus,D:ctwokinds-karenOOO:M
13-10-2018T20:30:08,w0lfmare,Yeah I don't consider sketch streams to be a source of cannon
13-10-2018T20:30:20,Twokinds,She was born of the force
13-10-2018T20:30:26,Dadrobit,(Also still holding out on the Lynn is the father speculation)
13-10-2018T20:30:31,LannAF,*star wars opening theme*
13-10-2018T20:30:33,Twokinds,They say she is the one to bring balance to it
13-10-2018T20:30:38,LannAF,can you draw that as a picture now tom
13-10-2018T20:30:42,w0lfmare,A lot of the requests are for a very specific outcome
13-10-2018T20:30:43,LannAF,her force choking someone
13-10-2018T20:30:43,CommanderTrace,Why isn't your music displayer working? Tom?
13-10-2018T20:30:45,Dadrobit,With Adelaide involved of course there was going to be force.
13-10-2018T20:30:55,Twokinds,I lost the program I was using
13-10-2018T20:31:00,Twokinds,And haven't found a new one that's any good
13-10-2018T20:31:16,CommanderTrace,ok
13-10-2018T20:31:34,w0lfmare,Chatroom Tom messages are 100% cannon though. No doubt
13-10-2018T20:32:07,w0lfmare,Cue the Raine>Natani screenshot links
13-10-2018T20:32:23,Ordithus,And the :ctwokinds-RainezZz::ptv-shipit:
13-10-2018T20:32:29,SpazztasticKiwi,If someone asks me too many “whys” or just gets annoying I tell them it’s so they’ll ask questions
13-10-2018T20:32:31,Dadrobit,"Also, a lot of the suggestions are turning into repeats. KANDAT both swapping genders with Keith turbo-blushing was already a thing. Even got a color vote."
13-10-2018T20:32:45,Dadrobit,Still came in second.
13-10-2018T20:32:45,LannAF,100% cannon?
13-10-2018T20:32:49,Dadrobit,Boggles the mind
13-10-2018T20:32:50,LannAF,We are playing sea of thieves now??
13-10-2018T20:33:24,Twokinds,"I mean, to be fair there's a lot less Keith and Natani lately, I've noticed"
13-10-2018T20:33:46,Ordithus,Mike and Evals stocks have gone up
13-10-2018T20:33:47,Dadrobit,"Yeah, there is honestly a bit less now."
13-10-2018T20:33:57,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah gotta invest in mevals
13-10-2018T20:34:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Do I need to try my sexy suggestion right quick instead of my Halloween suggestion?
13-10-2018T20:34:11,unsteddyphoenix,It is less than before yeah
13-10-2018T20:34:22,unsteddyphoenix,Just fuse them somehow

13-10-2018T20:47:46,Bgrmystr2,I've never suggested anything.
13-10-2018T20:48:08,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-floAAA:
13-10-2018T20:48:09,LannAF,hey
13-10-2018T20:48:14,LannAF,I need you all to do me a favor
13-10-2018T20:48:22,LannAF,"Whenever Tom says ""brb"" from here on out"
13-10-2018T20:48:32,LannAF,"I need you all to automatically say ""wb"""
13-10-2018T20:48:42,LannAF,it'll be a big help thanks
13-10-2018T20:48:52,Bgrmystr2,will not remember that
13-10-2018T20:49:21,LannAF,That's a pretty low memory stat then
13-10-2018T20:49:27,Bgrmystr2,it's not an image
13-10-2018T20:49:32,Bgrmystr2,so yeah
13-10-2018T20:49:34,Bgrmystr2,pretty low
13-10-2018T20:49:43,Bgrmystr2,unimportantness.
13-10-2018T20:52:49,Dadrobit,brb
13-10-2018T20:53:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Why’d we do that
13-10-2018T20:54:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Sometimes Tom just poofs and then jumps back in. But most often I suspect he just watches and silently judges
13-10-2018T20:54:58,LannAF,nah he's out grabbing snacks rn
13-10-2018T20:55:03,LannAF,Also it's because I originally did that
13-10-2018T20:55:07,LannAF,and he started doing it back to me
13-10-2018T20:55:15,LannAF,so he needs payback.
13-10-2018T20:55:21,LannAF,"rather, I need payback."
13-10-2018T20:55:31,Bgrmystr2,why do you need paypack if you started it?
13-10-2018T20:55:53,Ordithus,revenge is a dish best served reheated
13-10-2018T20:55:59,LannAF,Because nobody does it back to me.
13-10-2018T20:56:00,LannAF,nobody.
13-10-2018T20:56:05,Bgrmystr2,"reheated in the microwave of evil, Ord?"
13-10-2018T20:56:16,Bgrmystr2,sounds like tom is the hero we need
13-10-2018T20:56:22,SpazztasticKiwi,🎻
13-10-2018T20:57:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve been tempted to make cake batter pancakes lately
13-10-2018T20:58:17,SpazztasticKiwi,But the effort
13-10-2018T21:00:09,Bgrmystr2,"imo for all the effort I'd put into making pancakes, I'd just make waffles."
13-10-2018T21:01:40,Dadrobit,"imo for all the effort I'd put into making pancakes, I'd just make spaghetti tacos."
13-10-2018T21:01:46,Dadrobit,and back
13-10-2018T21:01:50,Dadrobit,with burgers.
13-10-2018T21:01:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Front
13-10-2018T21:01:54,Ordithus,wb
13-10-2018T21:02:01,Bgrmystr2,yeah but those aren't actually basically the same thing
13-10-2018T21:02:23,Bgrmystr2,"waffles and pancakes are close to the same thing, just one's a different shape and crunchy"
13-10-2018T21:02:27,Dadrobit,It's a matter of perspective really.
13-10-2018T21:02:35,Bgrmystr2,"they're made with the same batter, even"
13-10-2018T21:02:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Waffles are pancakes with abs
13-10-2018T21:03:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Eat waffles to gain their abs
13-10-2018T21:04:12,Bgrmystr2,xD
13-10-2018T21:04:17,Bgrmystr2,they are good
13-10-2018T21:04:32,Bgrmystr2,and the syrup doesn't go everywhere it wants to like pancakes
13-10-2018T21:04:42,Bgrmystr2,it says where it's damn told to
13-10-2018T21:05:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Waffles are the dominant breakfast food with abs
13-10-2018T21:05:15,Bgrmystr2,haha
13-10-2018T21:05:26,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I haven't had waffles in years"
13-10-2018T21:05:36,Bgrmystr2,They are a great foodstuff
13-10-2018T21:05:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Pair it with bacon and eggs for the strongest breakfast
13-10-2018T21:06:17,Bgrmystr2,I dunno about that. Homemade McMuffins are the best imo
13-10-2018T21:06:47,Bgrmystr2,bacon and eggs is great tho
13-10-2018T21:06:56,Bgrmystr2,and just add bacon to the side and it's basically the same breakfast plus extra
13-10-2018T21:08:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Bacon egg n cheese breakfast muffin with syrup swirled pancake batter buns
13-10-2018T21:08:27,Ordithus,you are making me hungry
13-10-2018T21:08:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I watch alot of cook shows and I do cook my on fancy stuff
13-10-2018T21:08:55,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
13-10-2018T21:08:59,SpazztasticKiwi,own
13-10-2018T21:09:01,Bgrmystr2,that legit sounds fuckin amazing
13-10-2018T21:09:14,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s something I sometimes make myself
13-10-2018T21:09:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Other times I roll it all into a breakfast burrito form and you just dip it in honey butter
13-10-2018T21:38:09,TheBeckoner,>I am happy for I have received a package
13-10-2018T21:39:46,Ordithus,:ptv-excited:
13-10-2018T21:40:56,TheBeckoner,It's new tubes for my tube amp. This is good
13-10-2018T21:41:28,TheBeckoner,The cheep chinesium ones have a bunch of static weirdness. hopefully these fix that
13-10-2018T21:41:32,TheBeckoner,cheap*
13-10-2018T21:41:54,Dadrobit,"Ah, thought it was gonna be a book 4 delivery or something like that."
13-10-2018T21:42:23,TheBeckoner,ah sorry to disappoint
13-10-2018T21:42:47,Ordithus,"Still waiting for mine :upside_down:.  Nice, Beck."
13-10-2018T21:43:39,Dadrobit,"Yeah, haven't received any notification since one mass-mail that I got months ago."
13-10-2018T21:44:06,Ordithus,"Shoot them an email, they responded pretty quickly."
13-10-2018T21:44:27,Ordithus,They've made a packing slip.  Just haven't shipped it yet.
13-10-2018T21:44:39,TheBeckoner,These tubes say they are matched to 5% but they have the exact same scores...wonder if that's a mistake...
13-10-2018T22:34:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m waiting for mine and two other packages
13-10-2018T22:34:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Storms are delaying absolutely everything
13-10-2018T22:34:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"But when it gets here, Kiwi shall have a new diet kibble to try!"
13-10-2018T22:35:28,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-natanisleep:
13-10-2018T22:52:58,TheBeckoner,I have ice cream over a browny. Very good
13-10-2018T23:01:36,SpazztasticKiwi,That reminds me I got ice cream too
13-10-2018T23:17:14,TheBeckoner,You should eat it
13-10-2018T23:24:05,SpazztasticKiwi,But it so far away
13-10-2018T23:41:43,TheBeckoner,where is far away?
13-10-2018T23:45:24,SpazztasticKiwi,The kitchen. Two rooms away
