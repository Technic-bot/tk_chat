06-06-2018T00:09:57,SpazztasticKiwi,More like “is that fuzzy spot moving or is that my imagination?”
06-06-2018T00:11:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I lose my phone on the bed without my contacts in and I’m lost
06-06-2018T00:12:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I just ask Siri where she is and she sounds off so I can uncover her
06-06-2018T00:13:35,unsteddyphoenix,that's amazing.
06-06-2018T00:13:57,unsteddyphoenix,One step closer to being able to yell out to siri to do everything for us
06-06-2018T00:14:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m waiting for her to yell at me for losing her in the covers so much
06-06-2018T00:14:56,SpazztasticKiwi,“Put me on the nightstand for once!”
06-06-2018T00:42:08,Twokinds,"I'll be honest, for a second, I almost asked alexa to turn on my hotel room's lights once or twice."
06-06-2018T00:42:50,Twokinds,I've gotten so used to voice activated lights.
06-06-2018T00:46:02,unsteddyphoenix,WALLE predicted the future
06-06-2018T00:46:20,unsteddyphoenix,We're slowly but surely becoming the humans from that movie
06-06-2018T00:46:39,Twokinds,Give me one of those floaty chairs and I'll be happy.
06-06-2018T00:46:47,unsteddyphoenix,I was thinking the same
06-06-2018T00:47:08,unsteddyphoenix,"Honestly future could be a lot worse, i'll take it."
06-06-2018T00:50:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Setting up Alexa doesn’t appeal to me. It’s convenient but I’d like to do things for myself while I can
06-06-2018T00:50:53,SpazztasticKiwi,And there’s that creepy thing she was doing - laughing randomly
06-06-2018T00:51:07,Twokinds,Why do things yourself when you can have a robot maid do it
06-06-2018T00:51:09,unsteddyphoenix,Nah im all for it.
06-06-2018T00:51:15,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d be calling an exorcist and grabbing a mallet
06-06-2018T00:51:22,unsteddyphoenix,"Ah, a man after my own heart"
06-06-2018T00:51:39,unsteddyphoenix,Doing things is the worst
06-06-2018T00:51:55,Dadrobit,Depends on the thing you're doing.
06-06-2018T00:52:09,unsteddyphoenix,Id rather things just happen around me
06-06-2018T00:52:09,Bgrmystr2,"I have a robot maid on my wall. Doesn't do too much, but least she looks pretty."
06-06-2018T00:52:12,unsteddyphoenix,For the most part
06-06-2018T00:52:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I like to do my own work
06-06-2018T00:53:22,Twokinds,"Alexa, ink my comic for me."
06-06-2018T00:53:50,SpazztasticKiwi,“I don’t have hands”
06-06-2018T00:54:13,unsteddyphoenix,Just press that ink button you have now
06-06-2018T00:54:16,unsteddyphoenix,Easy peasy
06-06-2018T00:54:31,Bgrmystr2,Don't worry Alexa. There's an app for that. :V
06-06-2018T00:54:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Let Holly walk across the keyboard. Something will get done
06-06-2018T00:55:18,iliar,Does someone really use voice control? I am surprised. I always thought it was just a marketing thing.
06-06-2018T00:55:18,unsteddyphoenix,10000 cats with typewriters...
06-06-2018T00:55:39,unsteddyphoenix,I would always use voice control if I could afford it!
06-06-2018T00:55:43,unsteddyphoenix,It's so...futury
06-06-2018T00:55:45,Twokinds,sdlkeowjdjfeedmewoc[ue
06-06-2018T00:55:48,Dadrobit,You could double the number of cats and still nothing would get done.
06-06-2018T00:56:01,unsteddyphoenix,lmao
06-06-2018T00:56:14,unsteddyphoenix,"Idk dad, looking at that..."
06-06-2018T00:56:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Good job Holly
06-06-2018T00:56:28,SpazztasticKiwi,You’re doing amazing
06-06-2018T00:56:33,Dadrobit,"Sneaking that ""feed me"" in there."
06-06-2018T00:56:42,unsteddyphoenix,I really feel like I understand what shes trying to say
06-06-2018T00:56:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Feed the cat :ctwokinds-floAAA:
06-06-2018T00:57:10,Twokinds,"No, she needs diet too."
06-06-2018T00:57:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Ah so it’s the “the amount you put in my bowl isn’t enough” thing not “you haven’t fed me yet” thing
06-06-2018T00:58:24,unsteddyphoenix,"""my bowl isnt full at all times this is unacceptable"""
06-06-2018T00:58:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera’s currently trying to “subtly” tell me he wants a snack
06-06-2018T00:59:32,unsteddyphoenix,Cats are clever that way
06-06-2018T01:00:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"He likes to sit right on top of my hip and just stare. If I continue ignoring him, he inches closer to my face"
06-06-2018T01:00:47,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s one of his ways anyway
06-06-2018T01:01:35,iliar,It seems strange to me. Say something instead of just pushing a button. Even when I drive a care to press a button it seems to me easier than talking with navigation
06-06-2018T01:03:07,SpazztasticKiwi,The most I’ve done is ask Siri to set a timer for me
06-06-2018T01:03:10,unsteddyphoenix,Thats completely different
06-06-2018T01:03:21,Twokinds,"It helps me a lot when I need to do math, or spell something. I just ask the air, and I get an answer."
06-06-2018T01:03:28,unsteddyphoenix,"Plus the car will be driving for me completely in the future, so I wont do either."
06-06-2018T01:03:31,Twokinds,Or know what day it is. Or how many days until something. Or set an alarm.
06-06-2018T01:04:12,unsteddyphoenix,You dont have to interrupt what youre doing~
06-06-2018T01:04:33,Twokinds,"Yeah, exactly. Really helps during streams so I don't have to stop and look up how to spell something."
06-06-2018T01:05:15,unsteddyphoenix,"I get distracted very easily, so I feel like it'd be pretty useful for me"
06-06-2018T01:05:47,unsteddyphoenix,Also it gets us used to robomaids
06-06-2018T01:05:56,unsteddyphoenix,which is good
06-06-2018T01:06:00,Twokinds,"I almost always forget to set alarms, so it's really handy when I can just say it outloud without going back to my desk."
06-06-2018T01:06:25,Twokinds,Just need to put a maid outfit on my alexa unit.
06-06-2018T01:07:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I have an inability to sit still most of the time
06-06-2018T01:07:28,Twokinds,Or perhaps steal one of Sage's Rem figurines and stuff it in there.
06-06-2018T01:07:30,unsteddyphoenix,dont forget the googly reyrd
06-06-2018T01:07:33,unsteddyphoenix,eyes*
06-06-2018T01:07:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t have a nervous system
06-06-2018T01:07:38,unsteddyphoenix,oooh that could work
06-06-2018T01:07:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I am a nervous system
06-06-2018T01:08:03,Dadrobit,"Oh man, a googly eyed Alexa. That's way funnier to me than it should be..."
06-06-2018T01:08:18,unsteddyphoenix,Have you seen that anime? The one that Rem's from
06-06-2018T01:08:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Is it technically correct that Kat is Eric’s Alexa?
06-06-2018T01:09:01,unsteddyphoenix,It's not...TECHNICALLY correct.
06-06-2018T01:10:31,Dadrobit,I don't think Alexa's warranty would cover that amount of damage.
06-06-2018T01:10:46,unsteddyphoenix,Im sure there's precedent
06-06-2018T01:10:51,unsteddyphoenix,Probably with the figurine
06-06-2018T01:11:14,Dadrobit,"Also, no. I have not seen Rem's anime."
06-06-2018T01:11:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"There’s sister-zoning, and then there’s Alexa-zoning"
06-06-2018T01:11:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Poor Kat
06-06-2018T01:14:45,unsteddyphoenix,Ouch right in the sympathy
06-06-2018T01:15:53,Twokinds,I have not seen it.
06-06-2018T01:15:59,Twokinds,It's not on the homework list.
06-06-2018T01:16:32,unsteddyphoenix,THATS the homework?
06-06-2018T01:16:38,Dadrobit,Really? Sage hasn't tied you down and forced you to watch it?
06-06-2018T01:16:56,Twokinds,No I just said it's not the homework.
06-06-2018T01:17:04,Twokinds,And no.
06-06-2018T01:17:06,Twokinds,Not yet...
06-06-2018T01:17:07,unsteddyphoenix,No I mean...
06-06-2018T01:17:23,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe he knows Tom wouldn't like it.
06-06-2018T01:17:33,unsteddyphoenix,What IS on the list
06-06-2018T01:19:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"Milk, eggs, bread, pencils..."
06-06-2018T01:20:19,Dadrobit,That's a shopping list tho.
06-06-2018T01:24:22,SpazztasticKiwi,He also wasn’t specific
06-06-2018T02:10:03,Dadrobit,I think the list was lost.
06-06-2018T02:16:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I think Tom just fell asleep on the computer
06-06-2018T02:18:34,unsteddyphoenix,Prolly just busy doing homework
06-06-2018T02:23:39,Dadrobit,"Less homework, more league"
06-06-2018T02:41:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I need to go on to bed
06-06-2018T02:41:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Gotta get up early - note
06-06-2018T02:41:35,SpazztasticKiwi,*nite
06-06-2018T02:44:11,unsteddyphoenix,Gnote
06-06-2018T02:48:09,Dadrobit,Night
06-06-2018T10:35:04,Trevuxnouxe,i'm woke
06-06-2018T12:46:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve somehow managed to scrape my leg in the past few hours
06-06-2018T13:25:53,Trevuxnouxe,"Tom, does Natani have a last name?"
06-06-2018T13:58:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Dropped my phone on a tile floor. Not a scratch. Toss it on my bed and it bounces off my hairdryer and the corner cracks
06-06-2018T13:59:35,SpazztasticKiwi,At least it’s just the screen protector
06-06-2018T14:04:41,Xexanoth,that's why you don't toss expensive electrical devices -.-
06-06-2018T14:06:05,SpazztasticKiwi,The problem is iPhones have a weird durability predictably
06-06-2018T14:07:01,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s landed screen first on concrete and been just fine
06-06-2018T14:18:46,Combak,Landing on just one point is a lot more stess than landing on a surface.
06-06-2018T14:19:08,Combak,See: Falling on a spike versus falling on the ground.
06-06-2018T14:26:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Jehovah witnesses in Walmart
06-06-2018T16:18:01,TheGamePlayer,@Xexanoth what of that expensive electric is a explosive device you need to throw before it explodes?
06-06-2018T16:19:22,Bgrmystr2,he didn't say anything about it being explosive
06-06-2018T16:19:25,Bgrmystr2,you fucking what xD
06-06-2018T16:20:05,TheGamePlayer,Ya but it could be an expensive electronic bomb
06-06-2018T16:20:56,TheGamePlayer,"""that's why you don't toss expensive electrical devices -.-"""
06-06-2018T16:21:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Anthrocon looked nice till I saw it was in Pittsburgh
06-06-2018T16:21:19,TheGamePlayer,Lol
06-06-2018T16:21:37,Bgrmystr2,"game, I think you broke"
06-06-2018T16:21:41,Bgrmystr2,you should reboot
06-06-2018T16:21:55,SpazztasticKiwi,And it doesn’t matter that I tossed it. Phones can crack or break if you so much as sit on it wrong
06-06-2018T16:21:56,TheGamePlayer,So what should I pre-order? Battlefield V? Or Call of Duty 4?
06-06-2018T16:23:06,TheGamePlayer,"@Bgrmystr2  also can you help me with a computer problem, you seem to be good at that stuff."
06-06-2018T16:23:25,Bgrmystr2,If I weren't doin other things :thinking:
06-06-2018T16:23:31,TheGamePlayer,. .
06-06-2018T16:23:36,TheGamePlayer,Fine
06-06-2018T16:24:07,Bgrmystr2,well tell me what happen and when I have a second I'll get back to you :u
06-06-2018T16:25:09,Xexanoth,"a bomb isn't an electrical device, at most its an explosive substance that primed by an electrical device...."
06-06-2018T16:25:26,Xexanoth,*that is
06-06-2018T16:25:30,TheGamePlayer,"My computer won't let my microphones record audio, I've try 3 different ones, the green bar that indicates how loud the audio is isn't showing anything"
06-06-2018T16:26:09,Xexanoth,check if microphone boost in the windows options is on
06-06-2018T16:26:24,TheGamePlayer,It is
06-06-2018T16:27:09,TheGamePlayer,I've searched for it and nothing has helped me yet
06-06-2018T16:28:08,Bgrmystr2,"if your mic isn't working, that means it's muted somewhere"
06-06-2018T16:28:25,TheGamePlayer,It only works if I set the mic to listen to the speakers but I get lots of feedback and it's annoying
06-06-2018T16:28:32,Bgrmystr2,there's lots of places to adjust volume
06-06-2018T16:28:49,Bgrmystr2,it's also possible that the mic port is dead
06-06-2018T16:29:16,TheGamePlayer,No I'm using a USB port for my mic on the HTCvive
06-06-2018T16:29:21,Xexanoth,"man, i swear i had that exact same problems under windows 7 years ago...."
06-06-2018T16:30:04,Bgrmystr2,"then it's prolly a driver issue, improper installation, or the service for the microphone isn't running"
06-06-2018T16:30:22,Xexanoth,and it was fixed by some stupid option in one of the thousand window audio options that were hidden somewhere...
06-06-2018T16:30:22,Bgrmystr2,there could be a dedicated service just for the mic since it's usb
06-06-2018T16:30:29,TheGamePlayer,"I've tried updating the drivers, updating windows resteting the PC , and going threw thesiund options"
06-06-2018T16:30:47,TheGamePlayer,* the sound
06-06-2018T16:30:50,Bgrmystr2,windows sound options are not going to change it if it's a 3rd party installation
06-06-2018T16:31:08,Bgrmystr2,and most usb mics from what I've seen tend to have 3rd party sound software
06-06-2018T16:31:13,Bgrmystr2,to adjust volume settings
06-06-2018T16:31:31,Bgrmystr2,cuz the built-in one for windows is pretty trash
06-06-2018T16:32:27,TheGamePlayer,My turtle Beach headset mic doesn't work either and that's a aux port
06-06-2018T16:32:45,Xexanoth,there might still be the case that one of windows's options is overriding the microphones
06-06-2018T16:33:05,TheGamePlayer,Is there a cure?
06-06-2018T16:33:54,Bgrmystr2,"""cure"" xD"
06-06-2018T16:34:04,Bgrmystr2,it's not alive
06-06-2018T16:34:11,Xexanoth,fiddling around in the audio options until you find the thing that you need to turn off/on
06-06-2018T16:34:19,Bgrmystr2,basically ^
06-06-2018T16:34:22,TheGamePlayer,I type fast I was gonna say fix but didn't make sense
06-06-2018T16:34:41,TheGamePlayer,... sigh
06-06-2018T16:35:03,TheGamePlayer,My sound options or the whole PC options
06-06-2018T16:35:18,Bgrmystr2,all of it
06-06-2018T16:35:24,Bgrmystr2,there's so many sound options
06-06-2018T16:35:29,Bgrmystr2,you need to check EVERYTHING
06-06-2018T16:37:18,TheGamePlayer,Noooooo
06-06-2018T16:37:54,TheGamePlayer,Found it
06-06-2018T16:38:11,Xexanoth,that was quick
06-06-2018T16:38:16,TheGamePlayer,Some one set it to 0%
06-06-2018T16:39:39,TheGamePlayer,Oh wait crap
06-06-2018T16:39:55,Bgrmystr2,it doesn't have to be someone
06-06-2018T16:39:58,Bgrmystr2,it could have been windows
06-06-2018T16:40:06,Bgrmystr2,doing something in the background
06-06-2018T16:42:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"Windows: I do what I want, especially if it inconveniences you"
06-06-2018T16:43:27,TheGamePlayer,...
06-06-2018T16:44:16,TheGamePlayer,Testing something brb
06-06-2018T16:45:13,TheGamePlayer,It's not saying it's plugged in just that something is occuping that audio port
06-06-2018T16:47:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"So the mic is plugged in but it’s saying something, but not the mic, is in the port?"
06-06-2018T16:47:28,TheGamePlayer,Ya
06-06-2018T16:47:39,TheGamePlayer,Fixed it
06-06-2018T16:48:07,TheGamePlayer,Someone or something set the allow microphone access to none
06-06-2018T16:48:29,Xexanoth,hooray for completely useless options
06-06-2018T16:48:36,TheGamePlayer,Yep
06-06-2018T16:49:09,TheGamePlayer,I'ma test it just to be Shure I saw the green bar moving so idk
06-06-2018T16:49:59,TheGamePlayer,Yep

06-06-2018T17:01:23,Xexanoth,"the eternal struggle in the Nat x Keith pairing, on one side, Nat got Boobs, on other Keith is really cute"
06-06-2018T17:01:42,Xexanoth,*on the other side
06-06-2018T17:01:46,Bgrmystr2,that's.. not a struggle

06-06-2018T17:02:22,Bgrmystr2,"probably in general, trev"
06-06-2018T17:02:33,Bgrmystr2,"nat's cute cuz it's not, not cuz she has boobs"
06-06-2018T17:02:37,Bgrmystr2,boobs are just bonus
06-06-2018T17:02:38,Xexanoth,also im having a fever and am really tired so i might not make sense....
06-06-2018T17:02:41,TheGamePlayer,I was going to ditch everyone to go play RecRoom but realized my VR controllers have to charge
06-06-2018T17:02:46,Bgrmystr2,"icing on the cake, as it were"
06-06-2018T17:03:01,Bgrmystr2,cuz it's nat*
06-06-2018T17:03:07,Bgrmystr2,srsly I can't keyboard with this damn thing
06-06-2018T17:03:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Too young for Anthro?
06-06-2018T17:03:44,Bgrmystr2,"who, kiwi? O.o"
06-06-2018T17:04:08,TheGamePlayer,I like to eat plastic
06-06-2018T17:04:10,Trevuxnouxe,yea who
06-06-2018T17:04:24,Trevuxnouxe,i like to eat noodles
06-06-2018T17:04:26,TheGamePlayer,Wait wtd where'd that come from
06-06-2018T17:04:34,TheGamePlayer,*wtf
06-06-2018T17:04:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Trev. You just mentioned being too young for something
06-06-2018T17:04:53,Bgrmystr2,he's too young to go to anthrocon
06-06-2018T17:04:56,Bgrmystr2,obv context
06-06-2018T17:05:11,Trevuxnouxe,and being a furry in general
06-06-2018T17:05:20,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve never seen a mentioned age limit
06-06-2018T17:05:41,Bgrmystr2,dunno if I agree w/ that trev. lots of kids like disney's animal characters
06-06-2018T17:05:45,Bgrmystr2,what's the diff
06-06-2018T17:06:03,Bgrmystr2,disney is only one artstyle
06-06-2018T17:06:07,Xexanoth,porn?...i mean furries are kinda famous for it....
06-06-2018T17:06:14,Trevuxnouxe,wearing a fursuit*
06-06-2018T17:06:14,Bgrmystr2,it's specifically family-friendly
06-06-2018T17:06:24,Bgrmystr2,that doesn't mean it's not anthropomorphic
06-06-2018T17:06:26,Bgrmystr2,they're the same thing
06-06-2018T17:06:30,Bgrmystr2,the EXACT same thing
06-06-2018T17:06:38,SpazztasticKiwi,In the toy isles there’s a plethora of human/animal hybrid dolls and figurines
06-06-2018T17:06:40,Bgrmystr2,disney just doesn't do adult stuff cuz it's disney
06-06-2018T17:06:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Especially in Walmart
06-06-2018T17:07:14,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. do you see other companies that own stuff doing adult stuff with the things they own? Not often
06-06-2018T17:07:21,Bgrmystr2,it's not even uncommon
06-06-2018T17:07:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Yet liking it in any way as an adult is weird. Go figure
06-06-2018T17:07:35,Bgrmystr2,"not weird, adults are just different from kids"
06-06-2018T17:07:41,Trevuxnouxe,way
06-06-2018T17:07:41,TheGamePlayer,I'd like to leave but my controllers aren't charged yet
06-06-2018T17:07:45,Xexanoth,It's only weird if you make it weird Spazz
06-06-2018T17:08:01,Bgrmystr2,the only thing weird about it is that people think liking adult things IS weird
06-06-2018T17:08:10,Bgrmystr2,cuz that screams that someone never grew up mentally
06-06-2018T17:08:14,Bgrmystr2,:u
06-06-2018T17:08:19,SpazztasticKiwi,There was a person in a fur suit at PAX
06-06-2018T17:08:54,Bgrmystr2,yeh they do that
06-06-2018T17:09:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Unexpected to run into going around the corner but not disturbing or anything
06-06-2018T17:09:21,TheGamePlayer,There was a person in a fur suit at some foot ball games(the mascot)
06-06-2018T17:09:55,SpazztasticKiwi,So are some sports fans technically furries
06-06-2018T17:09:57,Trevuxnouxe,lol
06-06-2018T17:10:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Seriously though
06-06-2018T17:10:37,TheGamePlayer,The mascots? Sure they agree to put it on soooo
06-06-2018T17:10:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Doesn’t that count
06-06-2018T17:10:53,TheGamePlayer,Ya
06-06-2018T17:11:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I guess too many people see animal people and think porn then I guess
06-06-2018T17:12:04,TheGamePlayer,thinks to himself when will his VR controllers be done charging?
06-06-2018T17:12:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe give them 30 minutes and check
06-06-2018T17:12:44,Trevuxnouxe,its fucking 1000 for a fursuit head and 3000 for the whole thing!?
06-06-2018T17:13:00,Xexanoth,"""""a watched pot doesn't boil"""
06-06-2018T17:13:08,Bgrmystr2,"well yeah, they're VERY expensive"
06-06-2018T17:13:14,Xexanoth,"yeah, fursuits a hard to make and the materials cost a lot"
06-06-2018T17:13:15,SpazztasticKiwi,My friend makes fur suits. They take a hell of a lot of work
06-06-2018T17:13:24,Xexanoth,so they are expensive
06-06-2018T17:13:25,Bgrmystr2,takes a metric fuckton of time and effort as well as the materials are expensive
06-06-2018T17:13:29,Trevuxnouxe,oof
06-06-2018T17:13:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Especially if they’re tailored
06-06-2018T17:13:38,Bgrmystr2,"if they're tailored, it's  even moreso expensive"
06-06-2018T17:13:44,Trevuxnouxe,im just gunn go hunting...
06-06-2018T17:13:46,Bgrmystr2,than someone doing it themselves
06-06-2018T17:13:54,TheGamePlayer,"Like the Railroad in fallout 4 ""those kooks? I thought they'd be to busy liberating vending machines or setting computer terminals free!"""
06-06-2018T17:13:59,Trevuxnouxe,then skin one
06-06-2018T17:14:04,Trevuxnouxe,wolf maybe
06-06-2018T17:14:04,Xexanoth,"fursuits are a luxury, and depending on how often you go to cons/meetups hardly worth it"
06-06-2018T17:14:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Some wolves are endangered though
06-06-2018T17:14:29,TheGamePlayer,Timber wolves
06-06-2018T17:14:35,SpazztasticKiwi,And it’s illegal to hunt out of season...or without a license
06-06-2018T17:15:07,TheGamePlayer,Very
06-06-2018T17:15:49,Trevuxnouxe,"i was like maybe my mom will get me one for this years halloween, that wa yi get a suit and without my mom noticing i wanted to be a furry.... but hell no $3000 is way to much..."
06-06-2018T17:16:13,Xexanoth,Timber Wolves?....must be some Clanners in here....
06-06-2018T17:16:18,TheGamePlayer,3000?
06-06-2018T17:16:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Not sure how much my friend charges
06-06-2018T17:17:19,TheGamePlayer,I've seen some for like $300-$500 and are pretty decent
06-06-2018T17:17:38,Xexanoth,"holy shit, i just realized i technicially owned a fursuit once, cause my mom made me a pickachu costume for carnival"
06-06-2018T17:17:56,Xexanoth,"i mean, i knew i've always been a furry, but dam"
06-06-2018T17:18:04,Trevuxnouxe,oof

06-06-2018T17:18:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Another person at PAX did a Crash Bandicoot suit

06-06-2018T17:19:15,Trevuxnouxe,without a large url
06-06-2018T17:19:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"Said if he/she wasn’t sweating now, they would be"
06-06-2018T17:20:43,Trevuxnouxe,"alright so its not for sale anymore, but heres a video on it.... is this considerd  a fursuit? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7u6jNNfXwCg&list=PLxV_ER5SmeVZKVrfLpt2YQ1Z-xty61bqZ"
06-06-2018T17:21:51,Xexanoth,"it's just an owl mask, so no?"
06-06-2018T17:21:56,TheGamePlayer,XD
06-06-2018T17:22:26,SpazztasticKiwi,That dude has a monster version of him on the Monster Legends app
06-06-2018T17:22:30,Trevuxnouxe,eh..

06-06-2018T17:23:10,Bgrmystr2,owls don't have fur. they have feathers.
06-06-2018T17:23:13,Bgrmystr2,they're birds
06-06-2018T17:23:31,Bgrmystr2,so it'd technically be.. a feather suit? Presuming it's a whole suit
06-06-2018T17:23:33,Bgrmystr2,which it's not
06-06-2018T17:23:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Some have been asking if they’ll make a Markiplier creature too
06-06-2018T17:23:39,Trevuxnouxe,well like does it consider me a furry?
06-06-2018T17:23:39,TheGamePlayer,Would that make em feathries?
06-06-2018T17:23:49,Bgrmystr2,"prolly, game"

06-06-2018T17:34:50,Bgrmystr2,nothing with scales is a furry
06-06-2018T17:34:58,Bgrmystr2,nothing without fur is a furry
06-06-2018T17:35:02,Bgrmystr2,that's not how it works
06-06-2018T17:35:24,Bgrmystr2,just cuz ppl are dumb doesn't mean it's a functional description xD
06-06-2018T17:37:11,Trevuxnouxe,maybe ill dress up as chewbacca
06-06-2018T18:04:18,TheGamePlayer,I'm back
06-06-2018T18:05:50,TheGamePlayer,Wow no need to get excited

06-06-2018T18:31:50,TheGamePlayer,Also
06-06-2018T18:32:19,TheGamePlayer,Pizza
06-06-2018T18:33:33,TheGamePlayer,Ever wonder why we sit here and talk like there's no other social media app we can use?
06-06-2018T18:45:16,Bgrmystr2,"""social media app"" people still use those? :thinking:"
06-06-2018T18:46:15,Trevuxnouxe,oh shit the house got struck by lightling and the power went out.
06-06-2018T18:46:24,Trevuxnouxe,damn reset my pc
06-06-2018T19:03:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"Most of my friends on FB are actually my family, I don’t talk to anyone on IG, my Twitter friend is likely sleeping rn, and I don’t use Snapchat"
06-06-2018T19:03:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Am I missing a platform? I feel like I am
06-06-2018T19:04:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t talk to anyone on Tumblr either (think that’s it)
06-06-2018T19:13:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Also - gave Bagheera a bath. He’s not happy with me
06-06-2018T19:27:15,Dadrobit,Discord.
06-06-2018T19:28:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t get on discord
06-06-2018T19:29:27,Dadrobit,Probably for the best.
06-06-2018T19:39:40,Trevuxnouxe,intsa?
06-06-2018T19:45:25,Dadrobit,"Not to say that you being on Discord is bad in and of itself, just that in my experiences of the fanbases on their TK Discord channels, it's a bad time."
06-06-2018T19:46:44,Dadrobit,90% of conversation that went on there while I tried them out consisted of everyone shit talking whatever server they weren't on and touting how their own personal TK Discord was far superior.
06-06-2018T19:47:05,Dadrobit,"Also, don't lewd ""X"" character because of reasons."
06-06-2018T19:48:09,Dadrobit,That kind of constant negativity is not my cup 'o joe.
06-06-2018T20:05:30,Bgrmystr2,they're both sides of the same coin imo Dadro
06-06-2018T20:06:38,SpazztasticKiwi,They can scream into the void over there
06-06-2018T20:06:56,SpazztasticKiwi,We’ll be over here having a civilized conversation :ctwokinds-kingtea:
06-06-2018T20:07:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Remember - pinkie out

06-06-2018T20:10:26,Dadrobit,It's so bad.
06-06-2018T20:10:28,Dadrobit,I love it
06-06-2018T20:11:30,CrRAR,Retrospective cringe
06-06-2018T20:11:41,Dadrobit,"Did a United Health Care commercial forever ago, but I didn't have any female voices in the class on the day of the recording even though there are 2 females in the video. We made do..."
06-06-2018T20:11:52,CrRAR,That's the specialist kind of cringe
06-06-2018T20:12:00,CrRAR,XD
06-06-2018T20:12:06,Dadrobit,This needs to go on YouTube.

06-06-2018T20:27:41,Bgrmystr2,legit xD
06-06-2018T20:27:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m currently watching Mark try not to laugh

06-06-2018T20:36:03,SpazztasticKiwi,💫 you tried
06-06-2018T20:36:10,Dadrobit,"It was a complete shit-show of a performance. Their ""acting"" was very, very intentionally bad."
06-06-2018T20:37:42,Dadrobit,"When the day started with both of the girls in the class being absent on the day of the recording, it all went downhill from there."
06-06-2018T20:37:54,CrRAR,lol
06-06-2018T20:38:25,unsteddyphoenix,Those girls mustve been very popular for their voices lol
06-06-2018T20:38:38,unsteddyphoenix,They shouldve coordinated sick days how rude
06-06-2018T20:38:45,Dadrobit,They were the only girls in the class lol.
06-06-2018T20:39:07,Dadrobit,The audio engineering pipeline at my school is very much a sausage fest.
06-06-2018T20:40:38,CrRAR,Probably was a running joke with the faculty.

06-06-2018T20:48:12,SpazztasticKiwi,"Yeah, that’s called a “customer service” voice"
06-06-2018T20:48:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t know her

06-06-2018T20:54:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don’t often, but mainly because the main noise I make as I work is humming"
06-06-2018T20:55:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Sometimes I wonder if anyone else listens or finds it irritating
06-06-2018T20:58:01,unsteddyphoenix,They probably have other things to worry about
