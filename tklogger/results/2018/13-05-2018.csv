13-05-2018T00:34:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t jog or run unless something’s chasing me
13-05-2018T00:34:28,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s people outside
13-05-2018T00:34:35,Dadrobit,"Believe it or not, Tom is not the sole proprietor of smartass-y-ness."
13-05-2018T00:34:42,SpazztasticKiwi,And bugs. Namely wasps
13-05-2018T00:34:51,SiliconCarbide,you can run from the people

13-05-2018T00:52:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Sam’s like “this is my smoosh. Go find your own”
13-05-2018T00:53:56,Bgrmystr2,"lol phoenix, you say that like she was ever /not/ a relatable character..? :P"
13-05-2018T00:55:35,unsteddyphoenix,Well I didnt know anything about her
13-05-2018T00:55:41,unsteddyphoenix,But now I find out she smoosh?
13-05-2018T00:55:44,unsteddyphoenix,Im on board.
13-05-2018T00:56:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m pretty sure Trace would smoosh if Flora didn’t care
13-05-2018T00:56:31,Bgrmystr2,I don't think flora cares at all
13-05-2018T00:56:42,Bgrmystr2,she smooshes herself all the time
13-05-2018T00:56:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Keith’s been asked if he wanted to smoosh already :ptv-snicker:
13-05-2018T00:58:14,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: Also Sam has a nice apartment, is a clean freak, is kinda prim and proper, and she's a writer. Plus, tom's writing her as a main character so she seems relatable to me."
13-05-2018T00:58:37,Bgrmystr2,"also, she boops."
13-05-2018T00:58:43,unsteddyphoenix,she do!
13-05-2018T00:58:47,Bgrmystr2,So I mean..
13-05-2018T00:58:57,Bgrmystr2,there's a lot there already
13-05-2018T01:00:09,unsteddyphoenix,Who relates to characters based on where they live and whether theyre protagonists? Those arent character traits
13-05-2018T01:00:26,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: I dunno
13-05-2018T01:00:29,Bgrmystr2,xD

13-05-2018T01:01:16,unsteddyphoenix,the best one
13-05-2018T01:01:38,Bgrmystr2,"xD it's not even a trait, it's an action"
13-05-2018T01:05:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Sam’s dating profile: “will boop the nose and smoosh the floof”
13-05-2018T01:06:07,unsteddyphoenix,(huge knockers)

13-05-2018T01:08:23,Dadrobit,Tinder is great fun tbqh.
13-05-2018T01:08:59,SpazztasticKiwi,If you a guy
13-05-2018T01:08:59,unsteddyphoenix,theres some pretty funny stuff out there
13-05-2018T01:09:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Bumble’s supposed to be safer anyway
13-05-2018T01:09:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Though not online dating is even better
13-05-2018T01:09:59,Dadrobit,The girls have plenty of fun as well in my experience. Very funny ladies on there.
13-05-2018T01:10:51,unsteddyphoenix,"If they didnt, then no women would use it."
13-05-2018T01:11:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Jellybean’s so tired he’s falling asleep biting my finger
13-05-2018T01:12:02,unsteddyphoenix,awhh~
13-05-2018T01:12:44,SpazztasticKiwi,They just had a good play. Bed time
13-05-2018T01:13:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Or a nap at the least
13-05-2018T01:20:04,Dadrobit,So I just found a really cool microscope that scans cells in 3D being marketed to teachers.
13-05-2018T01:20:24,Dadrobit,Thought it'd be cool to look into since my mom teaches science.
13-05-2018T01:20:31,Dadrobit,Then I saw the price.
13-05-2018T01:20:38,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
13-05-2018T01:20:43,Bgrmystr2,How much is it?
13-05-2018T01:20:46,Dadrobit,"They ~START~ at $30,000."
13-05-2018T01:20:56,Bgrmystr2,Neat :camera_with_flash:
13-05-2018T01:21:06,Bgrmystr2,It'll make a nice desk ornament.
13-05-2018T01:21:06,Dadrobit,That's literally how much she makes in a year.
13-05-2018T01:21:08,SiliconCarbide,yeah lab equipment is usually very expensive
13-05-2018T01:21:40,SiliconCarbide,"ive had to buy adapters for a thermostat, just 100g of metal, not that hard to manufacture, like 200 € each"
13-05-2018T01:21:46,Bgrmystr2,"My mother's a teacher, but she doesn't do the science stuff and wouldn't need that."
13-05-2018T01:21:56,Bgrmystr2,she's elementary special ed
13-05-2018T01:22:28,Dadrobit,"My mom isn't a sped specialist, but they gave her all of them this year."
13-05-2018T01:22:31,Bgrmystr2,"it'd be a really, really expensive paperweight"
13-05-2018T01:22:32,Dadrobit,Literally all of them.
13-05-2018T01:22:47,Dadrobit,So that they can all be graded on the same standards.
13-05-2018T01:23:18,Bgrmystr2,even though Special Ed is rated on a case-by-case basis because they /can't/ be graded by the same standards?
13-05-2018T01:23:41,Dadrobit,But it sucks because she has to spend so much time instructing them individually that the rest of the class has to wait around and twiddle their fingers.
13-05-2018T01:23:53,Dadrobit,"Yeah, she has IEP meetings nonstop."
13-05-2018T01:23:56,Bgrmystr2,yeah that sounds like a major oversight
13-05-2018T01:24:09,Bgrmystr2,there's no like.. teacher union or whatnot?
13-05-2018T01:24:18,Bgrmystr2,cuz that's not how classes are supposed to be
13-05-2018T01:24:22,Dadrobit,"There is, they just went on strike for a week."
13-05-2018T01:24:24,unsteddyphoenix,That seems really bizarre yeah :thinking:
13-05-2018T01:24:41,Dadrobit,Teachers get fucked hard in AZ.
13-05-2018T01:24:54,Bgrmystr2,you can't just put special ed kids in a normal classroom cuz that's just acting like special ed doesn't even exist
13-05-2018T01:24:56,unsteddyphoenix,Seems like thats the case for most places
13-05-2018T01:25:10,Dadrobit,Recommended class size is around 27. Her smallest is 35.
13-05-2018T01:25:34,Bgrmystr2,"here in Louisiana, the highest a Special Ed class can have is 6, I believe"
13-05-2018T01:25:40,Bgrmystr2,and that's w/ 3 adults
13-05-2018T01:25:44,Bgrmystr2,one for two kids
13-05-2018T01:25:56,Bgrmystr2,but they ignore it all the time
13-05-2018T01:26:19,Dadrobit,"Some of the kids do have their own proctors that come in with them, but they still need to be guided individually."
13-05-2018T01:26:24,SiliconCarbide,"they started merging special ed classes with normal classe sin germany as well, like 5 years ago, just after i left school"
13-05-2018T01:26:28,SiliconCarbide,dont know what came of this
13-05-2018T01:26:50,Bgrmystr2,"Probably less quality in overall education across the board, Silicon"
13-05-2018T01:26:56,SiliconCarbide,might be
13-05-2018T01:27:00,Bgrmystr2,tis what I'd wager
13-05-2018T01:27:48,SiliconCarbide,"anyway, just finished stream and breakfast, loved the sketches, especially loved that my suggestion won and how it turned out ^.^"
13-05-2018T01:27:50,SiliconCarbide,im off to work
13-05-2018T01:27:51,SiliconCarbide,byyye
13-05-2018T01:28:07,Bgrmystr2,seeya later :ptv-greetings:
13-05-2018T01:28:13,Dadrobit,Cya.
13-05-2018T01:28:33,Dadrobit,And the strike did jack all except screw up everyone's calendar.
13-05-2018T01:28:53,Dadrobit,"Governor promised a ""20%"" pay increase to the teachers."
13-05-2018T01:29:05,Bgrmystr2,that doesn't solve shit though :/
13-05-2018T01:29:06,Dadrobit,But that includes the 1% they got this year.
13-05-2018T01:29:16,Dadrobit,And the 20% is split over 4 years.
13-05-2018T01:29:27,Dadrobit,And it's only based off of a starting teachers salary.
13-05-2018T01:29:43,Bgrmystr2,yeah so basically it comes out to about nothin
13-05-2018T01:29:45,Dadrobit,And only about half of the teachers are actually entitled to it.
13-05-2018T01:30:04,Dadrobit,"""entitled"" I mean they they are only willing to pay some of the teachers."
13-05-2018T01:30:42,Dadrobit,"Physical education, tech education, the arts, and some other specializations aren't getting it."
13-05-2018T01:31:09,Dadrobit,So the individual city admins promised to split it up equally among them.
13-05-2018T01:31:49,Dadrobit,"Did the math, and over the next 3 years, my dad's gonna see a whopping 3% increase."
13-05-2018T01:32:07,Dadrobit,IF and only IF the governor actually does what he promised.
13-05-2018T01:32:16,Dadrobit,The whole thing is still up in the air.
13-05-2018T01:32:16,Bgrmystr2,"ooowee, what an increase! :U"
13-05-2018T01:32:30,Bgrmystr2,not that it's gonna solve all the other problems
13-05-2018T01:32:38,Dadrobit,Not gonna solve a damned thing.
13-05-2018T01:32:51,Dadrobit,Folks voted against the strike actually.
13-05-2018T01:33:22,Bgrmystr2,They think the problem will go away if you throw money at it
13-05-2018T01:33:25,Dadrobit,"They knew it was a bunch of bullshit, figured it'd be unfair to the students for them to miss a week of school just before finals."
13-05-2018T01:33:47,Dadrobit,but something like 79% of the state voted in favor of the strike.
13-05-2018T01:35:22,Dadrobit,"As I hear it, many of the teachers voted against the strike. But a majority of the population that voted were people like administration and janitorial."
13-05-2018T01:36:12,Dadrobit,"It's a buncha' horseshit, but whatcha gonna do."
13-05-2018T01:37:23,Bgrmystr2,"well, the whole point of strikes is to raise awareness and question the conditions that the upper management is failing at. Sometimes it works, sometimes it don't, but"
13-05-2018T01:37:54,Dadrobit,Plenty of folks showed up.
13-05-2018T01:37:55,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/3JQOgUB.jpg
13-05-2018T01:37:56,Bgrmystr2,usually they don't do anything cuz it's kinda hard to fight the management themselves when they control everything anyway
13-05-2018T01:38:11,Bgrmystr2,that's a hell of a lot of people
13-05-2018T01:38:25,Dadrobit,"Yeah, in 100 degree weather."
13-05-2018T01:38:47,Dadrobit,Too bad that everyone in the capital already left by the time they got there on Thursday.
13-05-2018T01:39:09,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I'm all for strikes if it gets shit solved by bringing attention to issues.. but yeah that's a problem"
13-05-2018T01:39:13,Dadrobit,"And they take Fridays off, so nothing got done the next day either."
13-05-2018T01:40:20,Dadrobit,"Took a week to get a promise. Nothing signed, but they promised."
13-05-2018T01:40:59,Bgrmystr2,"words words words, talk talk talk. If nothing was signed, I'd consider it a failure. :/"
13-05-2018T01:41:47,Dadrobit,"And Phoenix is warning its teachers not to wear their #RedForEd tee shirts to work or face a $5,000 fine."
13-05-2018T01:42:10,Dadrobit,"""we are advising against signs and shirts that contain any messaging regarding #RedforEd. Please remember that the penalty under A.R.S. § 15-511 is a personal fine of up to $5,000.”"
13-05-2018T01:42:42,Dadrobit,No political advocacy is allowed on school grounds.
13-05-2018T01:42:43,Bgrmystr2,"Do teachers have a uniform? Cuz if anyone got fined for that, they can counter that all the way up to the supreme court"
13-05-2018T01:43:26,Dadrobit,They'd lose. Schools do have dress codes.
13-05-2018T01:43:54,Dadrobit,And not allowing political advocacy by teachers in schools is something I support tbh
13-05-2018T01:44:12,Dadrobit,It just sucks that they take this exact moment to come out with the threat.
13-05-2018T01:44:27,Dadrobit,"Makes sense, still sucks."
13-05-2018T01:44:52,Bgrmystr2,"Well then there ya go. For the most part, there's this thing called Freedom of Expression. Questionable in which it applys in this particular instance though."
13-05-2018T01:46:14,Bgrmystr2,"Personally, I'd rather the teachers not be political as well"
13-05-2018T01:47:09,Bgrmystr2,but I'd question the fine.
13-05-2018T01:47:31,Bgrmystr2,cuz that just screams someone trying to silence a movement
13-05-2018T02:27:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Do cats have a need to walk all over you when you sit down or is that more of a for fun thing
13-05-2018T02:49:57,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: mmmm.. I dunno?
13-05-2018T02:59:07,Bgrmystr2,"every once in a while when I'm doing something and listening to my music, one of the songs tom plays on his stream pops up"
13-05-2018T02:59:30,Bgrmystr2,and I have to doubletake to make sure tom's not randomly streaming.. even though it ends up being like 4 or 5am..
13-05-2018T02:59:58,Bgrmystr2,":ptv-uneasy: I just.. I dunno, force of habit is hard to break"
13-05-2018T03:00:25,unsteddyphoenix,the one time you dont check will be the 5am stream
13-05-2018T03:04:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom may put his drawing hand to bed before 5 though
13-05-2018T03:05:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Since once he starts streaming he can go for at least 5 hours
13-05-2018T03:06:18,Bgrmystr2,xD
13-05-2018T03:06:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I did hear one of the stream songs on another video once and I was just like “I’ve heard this before. Where have I heard this?”
13-05-2018T03:06:30,Bgrmystr2,Ikr phoenix
13-05-2018T03:06:32,Bgrmystr2,it will be
13-05-2018T03:06:36,Bgrmystr2,I just know it..
13-05-2018T03:07:52,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I hear them around too
13-05-2018T03:07:56,SpazztasticKiwi,April fools 2019 - I can see it now
13-05-2018T03:25:10,Dadrobit,I've had the inverse happen.
13-05-2018T03:25:28,Dadrobit,Was playing The Witcher 3 when Tom's stream started playing the battle theme music.
13-05-2018T03:25:34,Dadrobit,for The Witcher 3
13-05-2018T03:25:56,Dadrobit,Was incredibly disorienting for a few seconds while I figured out what had happened.
13-05-2018T03:27:32,Bgrmystr2,haha
13-05-2018T03:29:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Where’s the threat? :ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake:
13-05-2018T03:29:49,Dadrobit,"I was playing Gwent at the time. I was like ""Oh crap, the game's bugged! I'm getting killed playing a card game!"""
13-05-2018T03:30:17,unsteddyphoenix,"""random bar brawl event aaa"""
13-05-2018T03:30:46,unsteddyphoenix,"One time I was watching a streamer and like, they sneezed at almost the exact same time I did."
13-05-2018T03:31:00,unsteddyphoenix,It was like my sneeze had an echo
13-05-2018T03:31:27,unsteddyphoenix,Possibly the most confusing few seconds of my life
13-05-2018T07:52:29,Trevuxnouxe,I'm almost done with coloring that one sketch that tom did [Zen x Kat] its lookin a'very nice! 👌
13-05-2018T11:56:07,Twokinds,Cool!
13-05-2018T11:56:14,Twokinds,Good morning~
13-05-2018T11:56:46,BadFoMo,Good morning.
13-05-2018T12:17:07,SiliconCarbide,good evening
13-05-2018T13:08:21,JamesBSquirrel3,2018 .05.13 Vote Sketch. I'll vote to Kat! She so gorgeous!
13-05-2018T14:42:53,PhilTheIdle,Hello
13-05-2018T15:45:04,SpazztasticKiwi,We’re all a little in love with Kat
13-05-2018T18:40:51,Trevuxnouxe,I am done! 😀
13-05-2018T18:40:54,Trevuxnouxe,https://www.instagram.com/p/Bixs6LnlCwS/
13-05-2018T18:41:15,Twokinds,Nice work :D
13-05-2018T18:56:34,Trevuxnouxe,Tank you *in a cute voice*
13-05-2018T19:14:36,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, Tom did you ever post that image of Maren wondering if she awoke somethin in her, the post-hotsprings img w/ raine?"
13-05-2018T19:14:56,Bgrmystr2,"cuz I know you posted one side image on patreon, but I dunno if you posted the one you showed in the stream"
13-05-2018T19:17:36,ElvenHunter84,"And the bunny girl laura and Raine one, is that part of a backlog for the week you're out of town?"
13-05-2018T19:17:57,Bgrmystr2,not the same. That's a patreon sketch. He posts those one per day.
13-05-2018T19:18:21,Bgrmystr2,"The one I'm talking about is a bonus sketch he only showed off in the stream but I don't see it anywhere, so I was just askin if he posted it"
13-05-2018T19:19:07,Twokinds,"Yes, the Keith giving Natani the necklace sketch and bunny girl sketch are my backlog for when I'm gone."
13-05-2018T19:19:29,Twokinds,"I'll be trying to do more bonus work as well, if I can."
13-05-2018T19:20:47,Trevuxnouxe,Do we get bonus work because were nice or you need too?
13-05-2018T19:20:50,Twokinds,"Uh, as for that Maren one, I didn't know where to put it."
13-05-2018T19:21:00,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
13-05-2018T19:21:23,Twokinds,"Well, I need something to post. I don't want the Patreon to go a week without any sketches."
13-05-2018T19:21:44,Bgrmystr2,"I saw a screencap in the discord, but figured I'd ask if you had posted it"
13-05-2018T19:22:00,Trevuxnouxe,But if you do sunday sketchs how could you go without a week of them?
13-05-2018T19:22:02,Bgrmystr2,you can always make a patreon post with a bunch of bonus doodles
13-05-2018T19:22:15,Bgrmystr2,"all the ones you don't know where to post, I mean"
13-05-2018T19:22:16,Twokinds,Because I'll be gone the last week this month.
13-05-2018T19:22:17,Trevuxnouxe,Not that you forget to do a sunday stream.
13-05-2018T19:22:36,Trevuxnouxe,Now everything make sense
13-05-2018T19:22:48,Bgrmystr2,he's going to a convention the last weekend
13-05-2018T19:23:00,Trevuxnouxe,Oh....
13-05-2018T19:23:11,Trevuxnouxe,Have fun!
13-05-2018T20:29:21,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s gonna be quiet
13-05-2018T20:47:55,Bgrmystr2,not for me :U
13-05-2018T22:14:04,Vatruvius,:ptv-sleepy:
13-05-2018T22:14:21,Vatruvius,"I feel so drained, mentally and physically."
13-05-2018T22:32:50,Trevuxnouxe,Same........................................................
13-05-2018T23:44:13,SiliconCarbide,will the color stream be delayed till june then or is it canceled?
13-05-2018T23:46:49,Bgrmystr2,It's not canceled
13-05-2018T23:46:59,Bgrmystr2,it's going to be either before or after the weekend he's gone
13-05-2018T23:47:04,Bgrmystr2,don't recall which one it was though
13-05-2018T23:47:10,SiliconCarbide,alright thanks
13-05-2018T23:47:31,Bgrmystr2,"it may be this weekend, actually"
13-05-2018T23:47:34,Bgrmystr2,dunno
13-05-2018T23:47:50,Bgrmystr2,or the first weekend in june
