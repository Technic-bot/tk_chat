11-01-2018T00:00:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,he had it coming
11-01-2018T00:00:13,TheFDdriver,true
11-01-2018T00:00:43,TheFDdriver,Did his bellow exploted?
11-01-2018T00:00:46,DevlNuK,"Well I'm going to bed, good night, guys  :wave:"
11-01-2018T00:00:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night Dev
11-01-2018T00:01:07,DevlNuK,bye
11-01-2018T00:01:13,TheFDdriver,good night Devl
11-01-2018T00:01:30,Dadrobit,I'm pretty sure it was just his catheter bag that exploded.
11-01-2018T00:01:35,Dadrobit,cya dev
11-01-2018T00:02:12,TheFDdriver,then what was the bag full with
11-01-2018T00:02:22,Dadrobit,urine
11-01-2018T00:02:36,unsteddyphoenix,lemonade
11-01-2018T00:02:41,Dadrobit,lemonade
11-01-2018T00:02:56,TheFDdriver,what?!!
11-01-2018T00:03:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,-_-
11-01-2018T00:03:34,TheFDdriver,either way it was funny/sad
11-01-2018T00:04:12,TheBeckoner,it was full of secret party beer
11-01-2018T00:04:17,Dadrobit,It occurs to me now that quite possibly not everyone has that the... experience... of being hooked up with a catheter....
11-01-2018T00:04:31,unsteddyphoenix,Doesnt seem pleasent
11-01-2018T00:04:34,TheBeckoner,Do you?
11-01-2018T00:05:19,Dadrobit,"Yeah, I mean, it's not the most pleasant thing in the world when it gets shoved in..."
11-01-2018T00:05:40,TheFDdriver,I dont even know what is that
11-01-2018T00:05:51,unsteddyphoenix,Dont tell him
11-01-2018T00:05:57,unsteddyphoenix,He doesnt need to know the evils of the world
11-01-2018T00:06:02,Dadrobit,Ask your mom.
11-01-2018T00:06:29,TheFDdriver,"shit, you're right"
11-01-2018T00:06:47,TheBeckoner,I would imagine its not
11-01-2018T00:07:04,Dadrobit,"Spent a good amount of time laid out in a hospital bed, I've had my share of evils."
11-01-2018T00:07:36,TheFDdriver,i have never been in a hospital bed
11-01-2018T00:07:37,Dadrobit,"I mean, it's not painful or anything, it just feels... backwards."
11-01-2018T00:07:47,TheBeckoner,I bet its nice not to have to get up to pee tho
11-01-2018T00:07:50,unsteddyphoenix,Rip. Ive had appendicitis but that's it.
11-01-2018T00:08:17,Dadrobit,You're forgetting the other side of that equation Beck. Literally the back side of it.
11-01-2018T00:08:53,TheFDdriver,probably uncomfortable
11-01-2018T00:09:53,Dadrobit,"It's really not physically uncomfortable, just a huge blow to your humility and sense of independence."
11-01-2018T00:10:11,TheBeckoner,Hmm
11-01-2018T00:11:28,Dadrobit,"At least for me. First time I was seriously hospitalized I was 15, which is like the height of the personal value for being self-sufficient. Then suddenly I couldn't use the bathroom by myself. It's very psychological."
11-01-2018T00:11:55,TheFDdriver,wow
11-01-2018T00:11:59,Dadrobit,"But I hate waxing on about that shit, I sound like an attention whore."
11-01-2018T00:12:14,Dadrobit,It was a decade ago. I'm very much over it.
11-01-2018T00:12:18,unsteddyphoenix,"Blow to your pride, you mean"
11-01-2018T00:12:25,TheFDdriver,"yeah, I am sorry"
11-01-2018T00:12:28,Dadrobit,"Yeah, very much so unsteddy."
11-01-2018T00:13:15,Dadrobit,"Even got some of my height back eventually, it's all good."
11-01-2018T00:13:39,TheBeckoner,"I like backstory Robit, all is good."
11-01-2018T00:13:52,TheFDdriver,wait? you got shorter
11-01-2018T00:14:05,TheFDdriver,from that?
11-01-2018T00:14:58,Dadrobit,"Yup, lost almost 2 inches. It was funny as hell the first time I went to my general doctor and got measured after I got out of the hospital. They had me measured 3 times before we realized why I was so much shorter."
11-01-2018T00:15:06,unsteddyphoenix,What?
11-01-2018T00:15:12,unsteddyphoenix,Never heard of that before
11-01-2018T00:15:20,Dadrobit,Compression fractures. I landed on my head and literally crushed my spine.
11-01-2018T00:15:20,unsteddyphoenix,"Losing height, spooky"
11-01-2018T00:15:43,Dadrobit,Used to be 6 foot. Suddenly I was 5'10''
11-01-2018T00:16:02,TheFDdriver,thats sad
11-01-2018T00:16:08,Dadrobit,Had a good laugh about it with the doctor when we realized.
11-01-2018T00:16:31,Dadrobit,"Yo, don't be sad, just wear you rhelmet!"
11-01-2018T00:16:38,Dadrobit,your helmet!*
11-01-2018T00:16:58,TheBeckoner,Maybe I'll gain those 2 inches
11-01-2018T00:17:05,TheBeckoner,they gotta go somewhere
11-01-2018T00:17:10,TheBeckoner,I'll take m
11-01-2018T00:17:10,TheFDdriver,LOL
11-01-2018T00:17:14,TheBeckoner,em*
11-01-2018T00:17:21,Dadrobit,And don't make stupid decisions buying big fast vehicles that you can't fully control.
11-01-2018T00:17:38,Dadrobit,Shit'll kill you without fucking warning.
11-01-2018T00:18:03,TheFDdriver,i was thinking buying an AE86 or an S15
11-01-2018T00:18:59,unsteddyphoenix,Did he explain why it happened?
11-01-2018T00:19:07,Dadrobit,what?
11-01-2018T00:19:11,TheFDdriver,no
11-01-2018T00:19:20,TheBeckoner,What did yah buy robit?
11-01-2018T00:19:21,unsteddyphoenix,Why you shortified?
11-01-2018T00:19:34,TheBeckoner,I like vehicles
11-01-2018T00:19:42,Dadrobit,I literally crushed my spine. It now takes up less space than it did when I was 15.
11-01-2018T00:19:57,Dadrobit,6 major compression fractures.
11-01-2018T00:20:09,Dadrobit,I landed on my head doing 85mph
11-01-2018T00:20:20,TheFDdriver,wow
11-01-2018T00:20:24,Dadrobit,Bones just gave out
11-01-2018T00:20:45,TheFDdriver,thats the danger of cars
11-01-2018T00:20:54,TheBeckoner,I crashed a homemade motorcycle in the ditch doing a wheelie. Not nearly 85mph tho
11-01-2018T00:21:10,Dadrobit,"Oh, and I was riding a CR500"
11-01-2018T00:21:28,TheBeckoner,Oooo
11-01-2018T00:21:30,TheBeckoner,Fast
11-01-2018T00:21:39,TheBeckoner,My dad had a CBR750
11-01-2018T00:21:50,TheFDdriver,cool
11-01-2018T00:21:53,TheBeckoner,He got it from my uncle who wrecked it
11-01-2018T00:21:58,Dadrobit,They essentially stopped making those bikes. They were literally so mean that there was no good reason for the general consumer to own one.
11-01-2018T00:22:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I want 7
11-01-2018T00:22:23,TheBeckoner,Hey they still make some batshit fast bikes.
11-01-2018T00:22:43,TheFDdriver,7 what?
11-01-2018T00:22:59,unsteddyphoenix,Huh...

11-01-2018T00:23:04,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"cr500, crb750, or h2r"
11-01-2018T00:23:09,unsteddyphoenix,"So like, is your spine still hecked up at all?"
11-01-2018T00:23:24,TheBeckoner,Im good with a 350 starter lol
11-01-2018T00:23:41,TheBeckoner,I really want a honda Grom
11-01-2018T00:23:44,Dadrobit,"Yeah, still sucks. But that's why I work out. Keep up the muscle strength and the bones don't have to carry as much."
11-01-2018T00:23:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I just want a bike that works and does not look like davy jones
11-01-2018T00:24:26,unsteddyphoenix,prostrats

11-01-2018T00:26:19,TheBeckoner,I would like one of those as a cafe racer Marv
11-01-2018T00:26:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"nah, I like normal cruisers more"
11-01-2018T00:27:57,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/I1Ox0kr.jpg?1 my poor bike

11-01-2018T00:28:32,TheFDdriver,dont you hate when someone comes up to you and say 'why do you need that much horsepower
11-01-2018T00:28:34,Dadrobit,"Yeah, 2 stroke. Braaaaaaap"
11-01-2018T00:28:47,unsteddyphoenix,Bom

11-01-2018T00:28:57,TheBeckoner,lel
11-01-2018T00:29:29,TheBeckoner,We have a bunch of 76cc 2 stroke chop saws for concrete. Those are fun
11-01-2018T00:30:12,TheFDdriver,it must be
11-01-2018T00:30:32,Dadrobit,"See that paddle tire on the back? $20 bucks. It wouldn't fit any other bike because they were too small and my shop guy was just like, ""take it, no one else I know rides those death machines."""
11-01-2018T00:31:26,TheFDdriver,that makes em rare
11-01-2018T00:31:50,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/Tql8PgI.jpg?1 Some of the rest of my bike still on the workbench.
11-01-2018T00:32:46,Dadrobit,"Rear shock just plain exploded, so I need to order a completely new one."
11-01-2018T00:34:27,TheBeckoner,I guess you rode around in the sand dunes alot?
11-01-2018T00:34:41,TheBeckoner,Any hydroplaning fun?
11-01-2018T00:34:59,Dadrobit,Purely sand dunes and trail riding.
11-01-2018T00:36:36,TheBeckoner,Sounds like fun...well until it wasnt
11-01-2018T00:36:42,Dadrobit,yep
11-01-2018T00:37:36,TheBeckoner,"I have a gokart that I did up. Wrecked it into a pallet of wood at like 20mph doing donuts. that was fun, took a good chunk outta my back"
11-01-2018T00:37:56,TheBeckoner,Worth it imo
11-01-2018T00:38:42,TheBeckoner,Welp Im gonna get to bed. See Y'all tomorrow possibly.
11-01-2018T00:38:51,KuroganeWatanoshi,wait. did Tom finish the page?
11-01-2018T00:40:24,TheFDdriver,yed

11-01-2018T00:49:02,Dadrobit,Have a good one all y'all that are going to bed.
11-01-2018T01:54:56,Twokinds,Aw crap
11-01-2018T01:55:15,Twokinds,My new keyboard I like doesn't have a numpad :\
11-01-2018T02:01:14,iliar,Which keyboard do you like? Perhaps there is a version of this keyboard with numpad?
11-01-2018T02:02:28,Twokinds,"Nah, probably not. It's a cheap, pretty niche keyboard."
11-01-2018T02:05:08,Twokinds,The only reason I bought this one was because it was referbished anyway.
11-01-2018T02:06:28,iliar,I do not quite understand what the problem is to find a good keyboard with numpad. Do you have any special requirements for the keyboard?
11-01-2018T02:06:44,Twokinds,I use a few alt codes.
11-01-2018T02:07:00,Twokinds,alt+7 makes •
11-01-2018T02:07:32,Twokinds,alt+0151 makes —
11-01-2018T02:08:05,Twokinds,alt+0150 makes –
11-01-2018T02:08:29,Twokinds,But the alt codes only work on the numpad
11-01-2018T02:09:09,iliar,I understand. I like the keyboard with numpad too. I meant in the store 100500 models of keyboards. What is the problem to find a suitable model for you.
11-01-2018T02:10:17,Twokinds,It's nothing.
11-01-2018T02:10:43,Twokinds,I just got a nice bluetooth keyboard that can switch between devices.
11-01-2018T02:11:03,Twokinds,It's just inconvenient without a numpad.
11-01-2018T02:16:39,Twokinds,"Actually, I may have found a replacement. It's more expensive, but... eh..."
11-01-2018T02:17:01,Twokinds,Ordered.
11-01-2018T02:17:39,iliar,"How about Logitech K780? Wireless - check, Multi-Device - check, Numpad - check"
11-01-2018T02:19:37,Twokinds,That's actually the exact one I ordered.
11-01-2018T02:19:39,Twokinds,Haha
11-01-2018T02:20:15,Twokinds,Refurbished. So it was cheaper.
11-01-2018T02:28:58,KuroganeWatanoshi,can't sleep..
11-01-2018T02:29:05,KuroganeWatanoshi,gonna be a rough day today
11-01-2018T03:58:15,BadFoMo,Sorry to read that.
11-01-2018T06:18:09,Bgrmystr2,presuming the infection doesn't get him
11-01-2018T06:19:37,TheFDdriver,ok
11-01-2018T06:20:01,Bgrmystr2,I think he may have a permanent imperfection in his stance / walking
11-01-2018T06:20:02,Dadrobit,"No, seriously, I think the bandage is gonna come off and it'll be totally fine. Like, maybe some scarring."
11-01-2018T06:20:13,Bgrmystr2,it just depends on how deep the cut was
11-01-2018T06:20:21,Bgrmystr2,"well, the burn*"
11-01-2018T06:20:27,Bgrmystr2,"how far it cut into his skin, I mean"
11-01-2018T06:20:51,TheFDdriver,then what degree was the burn
11-01-2018T06:21:36,TheFDdriver,I think 2
11-01-2018T06:21:57,Bgrmystr2,"it was pretty bad, but I don't know if we actually know how bad it was in terms of what degree"
11-01-2018T06:22:07,Dadrobit,"2nd is blistering, that was 3rd."
11-01-2018T06:22:20,TheFDdriver,was thinking the same thing
11-01-2018T06:22:32,Dadrobit,But Deus Ex Raine will save the day.
11-01-2018T06:22:39,Bgrmystr2,"well, she has no magic atm"
11-01-2018T06:22:43,Bgrmystr2,so we
11-01-2018T06:22:46,Bgrmystr2,we'll see
11-01-2018T06:22:53,Bgrmystr2,burned it all sending carver packing.
11-01-2018T06:23:21,TheFDdriver,can trace cure it
11-01-2018T06:23:40,TheFDdriver,or he will have to use black magic
11-01-2018T06:23:55,TheFDdriver,(*to cure it*)
11-01-2018T06:24:09,Bgrmystr2,"Trace can probably heal some of it, but unlikely all of it. I mean, Flora's a good example"
11-01-2018T06:24:14,Bgrmystr2,.not flora
11-01-2018T06:24:19,Bgrmystr2,uhh
11-01-2018T06:24:30,Bgrmystr2,"damnit, She'd be so angry with me right now"
11-01-2018T06:24:31,Bgrmystr2,Laura
11-01-2018T06:24:55,Dadrobit,"Naw, there was enough to revive Nibs, and I think during the cleaning/wrapping process she probably let some leftover juice into his wounds."
11-01-2018T06:25:19,Bgrmystr2,I don't think nibs was ever dead to begin with.
11-01-2018T06:25:28,TheFDdriver,you are saying his leg is infected?
11-01-2018T06:25:34,Bgrmystr2,she literally did say she burned everything she had into carver's teleport
11-01-2018T06:26:07,Dadrobit,Her glowing eyes that slowly subside tell otherwise.
11-01-2018T06:26:39,Bgrmystr2,"I don't think that's from her having more magic to play with, honestly"
11-01-2018T06:27:12,TheFDdriver,She said that happens unexpectedly
11-01-2018T06:27:16,Dadrobit,"I don't think it's intentional, just that she's demi-god tier of Mary Sue."
11-01-2018T06:27:31,Dadrobit,Shit just fixes itself around her.
11-01-2018T06:27:35,Bgrmystr2,"I'm unsure if glowy eyes have anything to do with magic reserves, I don't really see a correlation."
11-01-2018T06:27:56,Bgrmystr2,It only seems to happen for particularly strong spells
11-01-2018T06:28:30,TheFDdriver,she need some kind of training
11-01-2018T06:29:22,Dadrobit,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/996/ Super Glowy Eyes http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/997/ Moderaltely Glowy Eyes
11-01-2018T06:29:28,Dadrobit,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/1003/ Glow be gone
11-01-2018T06:29:50,Dadrobit,"It dissipates as she healed Nibs, then Zen"
11-01-2018T06:30:02,TheFDdriver,true
11-01-2018T06:30:13,Bgrmystr2,"Naw, I don't think so"
11-01-2018T06:30:20,Bgrmystr2,I think that's just the style tom drew it
11-01-2018T06:30:53,TheFDdriver,anything is unexpected by this point?
11-01-2018T06:31:16,Dadrobit,The death of Flora would be pretty unexpected.
11-01-2018T06:31:16,TheFDdriver,meant possible
11-01-2018T06:31:23,Dadrobit,ah
11-01-2018T06:31:35,Bgrmystr2,I'm gonna go into super-unpopular territory
11-01-2018T06:31:40,TheFDdriver,Flora die
11-01-2018T06:31:49,Bgrmystr2,and think that nibbly might actually be the next one to die
11-01-2018T06:31:49,TheFDdriver,yep very unexpected
11-01-2018T06:32:00,Bgrmystr2,"as nibbly was thrown against the tree, but got up"
11-01-2018T06:32:06,Bgrmystr2,coul have internal bleeding
11-01-2018T06:32:06,TheFDdriver,He is to popular
11-01-2018T06:32:08,Dadrobit,"Bitch, please, I live in super-unpopular territory"
11-01-2018T06:32:20,TheFDdriver,*She*
11-01-2018T06:33:06,Dadrobit,"I'm tellin' ya, it's all just a bi setup to showcase how powerful Raine actually is when they finally realize what she can do just on accident."
11-01-2018T06:33:08,Bgrmystr2,animals don't seem to show signs when they're hurt unless it really takes it's toll on their ability to move around
11-01-2018T06:33:12,Dadrobit,big*
11-01-2018T06:33:38,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, I think that would just be a convenient stretch."
11-01-2018T06:33:53,Dadrobit,Everything about Raine is a convenient stretch.
11-01-2018T06:34:19,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: I can't think of anything that would apply to that
11-01-2018T06:35:17,Dadrobit,"Being the daughter of the last grand templar who was ousted by Trace. The Daughter of the man who was one of Traces top people. The ability to see illusions on demand until it's convenient to not see them, the ability to repair the shackle with no trainin"
11-01-2018T06:35:28,Dadrobit,training...
11-01-2018T06:36:27,Dadrobit,Any one of those individually in another comic would make a character interesting.
11-01-2018T06:36:46,TheFDdriver,yep
11-01-2018T06:37:23,Bgrmystr2,"she's had that thing for her whole life. We don't know what her mom told her. But yeah none of those are really a convenient stretch imo. That being said, I dunno what you mean by ""Until it's convenient to not see illusions"""
11-01-2018T06:37:28,Bgrmystr2,I don't recall that being a thing at all.
11-01-2018T06:37:32,Dadrobit,"Oh, and let's not forget that emotions turn her into Goku"
11-01-2018T06:37:41,Bgrmystr2,that applies to everyone though?
11-01-2018T06:37:46,Bgrmystr2,it happened to trace too
11-01-2018T06:38:03,TheFDdriver,yep
11-01-2018T06:38:09,Dadrobit,"She saw Zen through his illusion, but didn't see him leave."
11-01-2018T06:38:38,Bgrmystr2,"It even applies to Zen, pushing through the anklet to say something to Natani"
11-01-2018T06:38:54,Bgrmystr2,so It's not applicable just to Raine
11-01-2018T06:39:21,TheFDdriver,well thats the mind link
11-01-2018T06:39:25,Dadrobit,Nearby mana pool conveniently messing with it iirc.
11-01-2018T06:39:44,Bgrmystr2,"That was the consensus by people in the chat, but I don't think it was ever commented on by Tom"
11-01-2018T06:39:56,Dadrobit,"And I never said it was just Raine, Trace and Keith are just as guilty."
11-01-2018T06:40:33,TheFDdriver,of outrage?
11-01-2018T06:40:58,Dadrobit,The whole story is full of bullcrap ex machina. But it's interesting enough for me to stay and have fun :D
11-01-2018T06:41:21,Bgrmystr2,"the anklet can be overpowered, it was already shown. It was made for a girl that can't control her power."
11-01-2018T06:41:30,Bgrmystr2,a young girl at that
11-01-2018T06:41:58,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, I don't think there's too much ex machina when looking at the story in it's own world"
11-01-2018T06:42:16,Bgrmystr2,it's only if you look at it with the convenience of our own world does it look as such
11-01-2018T06:42:26,Bgrmystr2,and that's not a fair judgement of the world imo anyway
11-01-2018T06:42:35,TheFDdriver,yes but i think the comic is based on 780?
11-01-2018T06:42:46,TheFDdriver,if i recall
11-01-2018T06:42:51,Dadrobit,I disagree. Too many convenient abilities and get out of jail free cards get tossed around.
11-01-2018T06:43:37,Bgrmystr2,That's because abilities are not bound by our rules of logic.
11-01-2018T06:43:55,Bgrmystr2,it would make them pointless
11-01-2018T06:44:07,Bgrmystr2,and betray the very world they belong to
11-01-2018T06:44:25,Dadrobit,"That's just saying that it's okay that they're gods, because gods don't play by our rules anyways."
11-01-2018T06:44:40,Bgrmystr2,Our rules never applied to the comic in the first place
11-01-2018T06:44:59,Dadrobit,It takes away all the tension of the comic. Why imply that a character is in peril if you KNOW that there really is no peril
11-01-2018T06:45:06,TheFDdriver,is like an entire different world
11-01-2018T06:45:29,Bgrmystr2,"I don't think there's a lack of peril, it's just different from what we would consider peril"
11-01-2018T06:45:36,Dadrobit,S'why I'm not worried.
11-01-2018T06:45:48,Dadrobit,Even the badguys don't get hurt any more
11-01-2018T06:46:11,TheFDdriver,just like team rocket
11-01-2018T06:47:22,Bgrmystr2,"Well, I dunno. I mean.. how many people died on the Basitin Isles? How many people died in the attack on Edinmire"
11-01-2018T06:47:39,Bgrmystr2,"Several for sure, on the island"
11-01-2018T06:48:07,Bgrmystr2,including popular characters.
11-01-2018T06:48:16,Dadrobit,"No one died in Edinmire, and the basitin Isles were literally 7 years ago"
11-01-2018T06:48:36,TheFDdriver,i was?
11-01-2018T06:49:04,Dadrobit,Not even the adorable wolf terrorist who got bitch-slapped off a wall by a dragon was killed.
11-01-2018T06:49:26,Bgrmystr2,Why would you think she was trying to kill them if she was going to interrogate him?
11-01-2018T06:49:30,Bgrmystr2,needs him alive for that.
11-01-2018T06:49:49,TheFDdriver,he was unconscious
11-01-2018T06:50:00,Bgrmystr2,and you really don't know if noone died in Edinmire
11-01-2018T06:50:00,Dadrobit,She didn't know that was the only shot she was going to get at having a prisoner.
11-01-2018T06:50:57,Bgrmystr2,"Considering she should take anyone she can get, probably a good idea to not kill them, but at least knock them out of the fight"
11-01-2018T06:51:01,Bgrmystr2,so they can't escape
11-01-2018T06:51:06,Bgrmystr2,"the more, the better"
11-01-2018T06:51:13,TheFDdriver,or get em hurt
11-01-2018T06:51:15,Dadrobit,No one dies on screen. Which means anyone even remotely close to potentially a little important can't die.
11-01-2018T06:51:15,Bgrmystr2,esp since she can interrogate by just reading minds
11-01-2018T06:51:58,TheFDdriver,but she doesn't know Kedrian
11-01-2018T06:52:00,Bgrmystr2,I don't believe that Dadro. There's been several times that happened in the comic. Just cuz it hasn't happened recently doesn't automatically mean it won't happen again
11-01-2018T06:52:11,Dadrobit,Recent being 7 years
11-01-2018T06:52:20,TheFDdriver,XD
11-01-2018T06:52:31,Dadrobit,"Naw, it's just that Tom has changed the style up."
11-01-2018T06:52:46,Dadrobit,He doesn't want anymore backlash I think.
11-01-2018T06:53:06,Dadrobit,Even fucking Seraphina has a fan club.
11-01-2018T06:53:13,TheFDdriver,well i am leaving
11-01-2018T06:53:17,Dadrobit,peace
11-01-2018T06:53:22,Bgrmystr2,Everyone has a fanclub. XD I just don't see it though
11-01-2018T06:53:30,Bgrmystr2,seeya FD
11-01-2018T06:53:48,Dadrobit,Not that I blame him. People in this fandom are out of their damned minds.
11-01-2018T06:54:40,Bgrmystr2,"I just don't see it the same way. I think he was just updating much more often back then. It's not like Tom is.. I dunno, insert story-writer that kills everyone's favorite character here."
11-01-2018T06:55:24,Bgrmystr2,"characters die when they need to, it's not about whether the people like them or not, it's about the story."
11-01-2018T06:56:17,Dadrobit,"Naw, he's kept a pretty steady rate sine 2008 when he was still offing peeps"
11-01-2018T06:56:25,Dadrobit,since
11-01-2018T06:56:56,Bgrmystr2,"If anyone is the next Laura, I think it'd be Nibbly. May show signs of internal bleeding. He's put stuff like that in the comic before"
11-01-2018T06:57:21,Bgrmystr2,"hell, he put what looks like Maddie's dad in one of the sketches he did"
11-01-2018T06:57:50,Bgrmystr2,and noone knew who it was till recently when he just did the coloring of the sleeping maddie one.
11-01-2018T06:58:22,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, you could be right. He may not be killing anyone else."
11-01-2018T06:58:26,Bgrmystr2,But I'd be sad
11-01-2018T06:58:40,Dadrobit,"Sera should have been vorpaled in twain after informing the party of the hunt for wolves, and Carver should have been vaporized after telling the party about Clovis."
11-01-2018T06:58:54,Bgrmystr2,"The story should be written based on the story itself, not on what the fandom demands."
11-01-2018T06:59:16,Dadrobit,"They both served their purpose and should have been sent off to the rainbow bridge, but alas, ""lots of explosions, nobody dies"""
11-01-2018T07:00:01,Bgrmystr2,"I don't know if that's a bad thing, maybe he has plans for them later."
11-01-2018T07:00:31,Dadrobit,Too many characters as it is honestly.
11-01-2018T07:00:54,Dadrobit,Already main benefactors are completely left in the dust
11-01-2018T07:02:24,Bgrmystr2,Plenty of games have massive character pools and great stories with relatively few characters dying.
11-01-2018T07:02:55,Bgrmystr2,"comics, movies, shows, lots of things have that"
11-01-2018T07:03:14,Bgrmystr2,is it bad?
11-01-2018T07:03:21,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering:
11-01-2018T07:03:50,Dadrobit,When they're so relegated to the sidelines that they aren't seen for years at a time? yes.
11-01-2018T07:05:54,Bgrmystr2,"Pacing is important. I just think that the comic is just updating slowly enough that the pace is what causes that, rather than the story itself."
11-01-2018T07:06:06,Bgrmystr2,the update pace*
11-01-2018T07:06:09,Bgrmystr2,rahter than story pace
11-01-2018T07:08:20,Dadrobit,"Pacing a story is fine. But we're running for over 11 years now and you're asking to keep minor characters because maybe he has plans for them, and yet we still haven't even met the Master Templar Mage."
11-01-2018T07:09:24,Bgrmystr2,"I just don't see why killing a minor character is necessary. If it's not essential for the story to move forward, it's just extra fluff that can be cut out."
11-01-2018T07:09:39,Dadrobit,Over a thousand comics now and one of the main baddies hasn't appeared. He could have released a page a day for nearly three straight years and we sill haven't met him.
11-01-2018T07:10:07,Dadrobit,"No, killing the minor bad guy is cutting the fluff."
11-01-2018T07:10:19,Bgrmystr2,that's just forced io
11-01-2018T07:10:20,Bgrmystr2,imo
11-01-2018T07:10:36,Dadrobit,JackieChanWutFace.png
11-01-2018T07:10:46,Bgrmystr2,xD
11-01-2018T07:11:54,Dadrobit,"It's literally the opposite of forced. The minor bad guys are there to give exposition, cause a threat, and then fuck off, usually but not always by dying."
11-01-2018T07:12:04,Bgrmystr2,"You're right, we haven't seen everyone yet, but it all needs to align to a story. I'm sure tom would re-write most of it if he had a way to magically do so without time."
11-01-2018T07:12:32,Dadrobit,"But FORCING all of them to live, (even a friggin squirrel) is what's really fluff."
11-01-2018T07:13:40,Bgrmystr2,"and no, that's really not the case. Killing a minor bad guy without using that to move the plot forward is forced by definition. Letting them live is not a forced decision. It's an open one. It allows the creator to choose whether or not they come back."
11-01-2018T07:13:46,Bgrmystr2,Killing them forces only one outcome.
11-01-2018T07:14:12,Bgrmystr2,Story trumps all.
11-01-2018T07:14:27,Dadrobit,"Coming back doesn't add content to the story, it only adds time."
11-01-2018T07:14:36,Dadrobit,Literally fluffing it out.
11-01-2018T07:15:46,Bgrmystr2,"It can add to the story. When a main character isn't willing to kill the bad guy, and they come back again. So they have to overcome that and get rid of the guy that came back so he doesn't do it again"
11-01-2018T07:15:56,Bgrmystr2,that's part of character growth
11-01-2018T07:16:02,Bgrmystr2,and is not just fluff
11-01-2018T07:16:28,Bgrmystr2,"Just a random example, but nonetheless"
11-01-2018T07:16:49,Dadrobit,That's Team Rocket.
11-01-2018T07:17:02,Bgrmystr2,Team Rocket is fluff. Ash doesn't learn.
11-01-2018T07:17:07,Bgrmystr2,"that's bad writing, basically."
11-01-2018T07:17:26,Bgrmystr2,it wasn't used to move the story forward.
11-01-2018T07:17:53,Bgrmystr2,Definitely a problem
11-01-2018T07:18:04,Dadrobit,"Neither will Sera, but still she lived."
11-01-2018T07:19:22,Bgrmystr2,"We haven't seen her since. And I'm pretty damn sure if Reni told her not to be a nuisance, she would listen."
11-01-2018T07:19:34,Bgrmystr2,considering dragon worship and all
11-01-2018T07:20:38,Dadrobit,"So we have to sit through more pages of just Reni telling her not to be a dick and then it's good? That doesn't do anything to the plot of getting to Lyn'Knoll or fixing the Templar. Again, fluff."
11-01-2018T07:21:47,Dadrobit,"Orrrrr, Keith could've just vorpaled her, made a witty remark, and we'd never waste a page with her again."
11-01-2018T07:23:25,Bgrmystr2,"That's not true, we don't even have to see it. Could happen off-screen. Also, her death would have been a topic of a page or two, it's unlikely that it would take any more or less time than Reni telling her not to be  a dick."
11-01-2018T07:23:30,Bgrmystr2,It's not even that significant of a thing
11-01-2018T07:24:50,Dadrobit,"Her death would have just taken up the space of Reni making her pass out. Nothing added. Now, more of her is guaranteed if she was indeed kept alive for a reason other than not wanting to kill anyone."
11-01-2018T07:26:21,Dadrobit,She had 4 pages of getting back up and fawning over Reni where her eulogy could have fit.
11-01-2018T07:26:38,Bgrmystr2,xD Why must everyone die
11-01-2018T07:26:49,Dadrobit,Where the hell did I say that?
11-01-2018T07:27:32,Bgrmystr2,"Well, you're saying if all the unimportant bad guys die, that's better than letting them live"
11-01-2018T07:27:40,Dadrobit,"Dadrobit wrote: ""usually but not always by dying."""
11-01-2018T07:27:43,Bgrmystr2,I just don't see why
11-01-2018T07:28:00,Dadrobit,And I'm talking good guys as well.
11-01-2018T07:29:02,Bgrmystr2,Bad guys have stopped being bad before. And they wouldn't have that option available to them if they weren't spared. Also used as character growth. Dying is not something that should be used to just get rid of unimportant characters
11-01-2018T07:29:07,Dadrobit,"Adria and Nibbly would have been excellent heart wrench-ers that could have brought back some threat to the world, but they too lived."
11-01-2018T07:29:28,Dadrobit,Neither is becoming a good guy.
11-01-2018T07:30:12,Dadrobit,Especially when Tom is already juggling a dozen of them aready
11-01-2018T07:30:52,Bgrmystr2,"xD Carver probably not, but Sera was likely just a mercenary. She has no ties, she's not a stereotypical 'bad guy'"
11-01-2018T07:30:54,Dadrobit,Close to 19 protagonists by my count
11-01-2018T07:31:47,Dadrobit,"It's also what makes her disposable. She gave some world building and plot stuffs, and now she's done."
11-01-2018T07:31:53,Bgrmystr2,"I still think Nibbly may be the next to go, if not Zen. And both of them still have death flags."
11-01-2018T07:32:15,Bgrmystr2,"Why is she done though? What makes her ""done""?"
11-01-2018T07:32:24,Dadrobit,And it would have made excellent character growth potential for Landen and Sealeen
11-01-2018T07:32:37,Bgrmystr2,that's only one path of many
11-01-2018T07:33:01,Dadrobit,"She's not connected to the Templar, the masks, or Lyn'Knoll. Therefore she has nothing to add to the main plot."
11-01-2018T07:33:19,Dadrobit,She was a side quest and now she's done
11-01-2018T07:34:33,Bgrmystr2,"She's connected to dragons, an entire group of people worshipping dragons. She could easily be a way to give more insight on how dragons really are, considering Nora's out for the count and Reni's not exactly knowledgable with that, if I recall correctly."
11-01-2018T07:35:22,Bgrmystr2,"The dragons are something we have very, very little information on, and we also know that information about dragons is spoilers"
11-01-2018T07:35:33,Bgrmystr2,"which means they're important to the story, later, cuz tom won't talk about it"
11-01-2018T07:35:47,Bgrmystr2,"least, won't talk about some things, anyway"
11-01-2018T07:35:48,Dadrobit,Reni is just not knowledgeable about people customs as most dragons take no note of them. Nothing about her not knowing what it's like to be a dragon.
11-01-2018T07:37:20,Dadrobit,So why artificially inflate character count with one villain for a bit of exposition when the information can come from a much better  source.
11-01-2018T07:37:54,Bgrmystr2,"Wasn't it said that Reni has spent a lot of her time with people, instead of yknow, out being a dragon?"
11-01-2018T07:38:03,Dadrobit,No?
11-01-2018T07:38:12,Bgrmystr2,I definitely recall it
11-01-2018T07:38:25,Bgrmystr2,"May not have been in the story, may have been said on stream"
11-01-2018T07:38:28,Bgrmystr2,but I recall it
11-01-2018T07:39:48,Bgrmystr2,"I vaguely remember it being said that Reni was probably not one of the best to be asking about dragons in general, as she doesn't have a lot of knowledge on the subject. Basically something to that effect"
11-01-2018T07:40:24,Bgrmystr2,"and if true, it would make sense that a whole group of people worshipping dragons would keep tabs on everything they can"
11-01-2018T07:41:10,Bgrmystr2,"but since it's all the future of the comic, it's all just speculation"
11-01-2018T07:41:33,Bgrmystr2,dunno what's coming next
11-01-2018T07:41:51,Dadrobit,So go to them? Getting the info from a lunatic mercenary isn't such a good idea either.
11-01-2018T07:42:18,Bgrmystr2,"maybe not her, specifically, but the people she belongs to, the worshippers"
11-01-2018T07:42:24,Bgrmystr2,they may not be as lunatic as she is
11-01-2018T07:42:41,Bgrmystr2,"in fact, I'm pretty sure it was said she's pretty loony compared to the rest"
11-01-2018T07:42:53,Dadrobit,If she even is a real ardakist. Very real possibility that she wasn't as Landen wasn't a real guard and Sealeen wasn't a real Templar.
11-01-2018T07:42:58,Bgrmystr2,but I'm not 100% on that one
11-01-2018T07:44:06,Bgrmystr2,"Well, the Ardakists aren't the ones that worship dragons, they're the ones that are part dragons. The people like Sera are the ones that modify their body /because/ they worship dragons"
11-01-2018T07:44:18,Bgrmystr2,far as I recall
11-01-2018T07:44:23,Bgrmystr2,the difference between the two
11-01-2018T07:45:16,Bgrmystr2,"Though, I mean, the ardakists COULD worship dragons, I don't know, but I'm pretty sure it's that she's not a real one, and she's with a group of other non-real ardakists that worship dragons"
11-01-2018T07:45:43,Dadrobit,"Lynn: ""Amulet of an Ardakist - Dragon Worshipper."""
11-01-2018T07:46:16,Dadrobit,http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/879/
11-01-2018T07:46:22,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah, it would definitely prove it."
11-01-2018T07:46:23,BadFoMo,Where was it said that the Adrakists were Half-Dragin?
11-01-2018T07:46:43,Dadrobit,"Yeah, Lynn even says that they're still just human."
11-01-2018T07:46:57,BadFoMo,*Dragon
11-01-2018T07:47:09,Dadrobit,And she could have just stolen the amulet. She didn't care much for courtesy customs.
11-01-2018T07:47:15,Bgrmystr2,Becuase I'm sure that the ardakist are actually half dragon..
11-01-2018T07:47:31,Bgrmystr2,and she HAS an amulet specifically because she's a fanatical dragon worshipper
11-01-2018T07:47:38,Bgrmystr2,and wants to be an ardakist
11-01-2018T07:47:40,Bgrmystr2,but isn't.
11-01-2018T07:48:15,Dadrobit,Doesn't mean she's really an Ardakist or part dragon. Just that she has magic.
11-01-2018T07:48:23,Bgrmystr2,And I'm not saying she is
11-01-2018T07:48:26,Bgrmystr2,Never did
11-01-2018T07:48:42,Bgrmystr2,I even specifically stated that there was a difference :u
11-01-2018T07:48:59,Dadrobit,"What did you mean by ""Yeah, it would definitely prove it."" when I said she had an amulet"
11-01-2018T07:49:00,Dadrobit,?
11-01-2018T07:50:20,Bgrmystr2,"cuz you're implying that Ardakists are the humans that worship dragons, and I'm saying no, I remember that ardakists are half-dragons and she's an ardakist wannabe. Which would explain why she has the amulet, because she's trying to pass herself off"
11-01-2018T07:50:23,Bgrmystr2,as something she is not.
11-01-2018T07:51:44,Bgrmystr2,"It would make sense that a fanatical group of dragon worshippers would obsess over dragons, even go so far as to think they ARE part dragon simply by modifying their bodies"
11-01-2018T07:52:08,Bgrmystr2,but they are still not part dragon
11-01-2018T07:53:19,Bgrmystr2,her having the amulet makes sense when she's trying to be something she's not. Especially considering she went so far as to modify her body for it.
11-01-2018T07:54:01,Dadrobit,"I mean, Lynn literally states it just like that. Literally ""dragon worshiper"" But there is nothing in the comic saying that they are half-dragons."
11-01-2018T07:54:14,Dadrobit,"Only that some area ""fanatical"""
11-01-2018T07:54:17,Dadrobit,are*
11-01-2018T07:55:02,Dadrobit,"""Many humans consider them symbols of power, some are more fanatical about it than others."""
11-01-2018T07:55:25,Bgrmystr2,"Lynn says what the amulet is, and what she is. That doesn't automatically mean the two are one in the same. Tom's done images of trace being half dragon due to nora magic"
11-01-2018T07:55:30,Bgrmystr2,and her magic is not just illusionary
11-01-2018T07:56:02,Dadrobit,That has no relevance to the comic proper.
11-01-2018T07:56:51,Dadrobit,"I've seen Tom do sketches of Trace and Alaric making out, out of comic shenanigans are just that."
11-01-2018T07:57:14,Bgrmystr2,"Yes it is relevant. Because that, and the discussion of Ardakists that come with it, stated that ardakists were half dragon, and the worshippers are just fanatics who change their bodies to try and BE one."
11-01-2018T07:57:57,BadFoMo,@Bgrmystr2 Tom gave lore while drawing it?
11-01-2018T07:58:12,Dadrobit,"There is literally nowhere in the comic that says that they are half-dragons, only that they are humans who are fanatical about it. Until that changes, it's just shenaniganry."
11-01-2018T07:58:51,Dadrobit,As it directly conflicts with what's on the actual pages.
11-01-2018T07:58:57,Bgrmystr2,He's drawn lots of ardakist images. And several times he answers questions about them. I don't know if it was while he was drawing it. Could have been during the comic page w/ Sera.
11-01-2018T07:59:13,Bgrmystr2,It doesn't conflict at all. You're just making a connection that isn't actually guarenteed.
11-01-2018T07:59:30,Bgrmystr2,Both are possible
11-01-2018T07:59:42,Dadrobit,I'm working within the comic proper.
11-01-2018T08:00:16,Bgrmystr2,"Well, then I guess you'll have to wait till he reveals it in the comic proper, then."
11-01-2018T08:00:17,Dadrobit,It's pretty explicit about them just being humans
11-01-2018T08:00:21,BadFoMo,"...Also, how does one 'become' Half-Dragon?"
11-01-2018T08:00:35,Bgrmystr2,"You don't, Fomo, you probably have to be born as such"
11-01-2018T08:01:08,Bgrmystr2,"Perhaps perfect transformation, like Euchre"
11-01-2018T08:01:26,Bgrmystr2,or like Nora's transformation magic
11-01-2018T08:01:57,Bgrmystr2,but it's obviously not something normal
11-01-2018T08:02:58,Bgrmystr2,"s'already 7am, fok :C"
11-01-2018T08:03:20,BadFoMo,I have 8:03 AM.
11-01-2018T08:03:28,Bgrmystr2,I should head to bed
11-01-2018T08:03:32,Dadrobit,6
11-01-2018T08:03:45,Dadrobit,Need to head to the water company today as well....
11-01-2018T08:03:51,Dadrobit,blughhh
11-01-2018T08:04:04,Bgrmystr2,"Good chat Dadro, got a lot of food for thought. :thumbsup:"
11-01-2018T08:04:21,Dadrobit,"Aye, have a good one"
11-01-2018T08:04:44,Bgrmystr2,You too. Gnight guys. :)

11-01-2018T17:45:37,TheBeckoner,I just got a letter from Trump

11-01-2018T17:48:41,MidnightBlue78,So that I can wipe my ass with it

11-01-2018T17:50:46,MidnightBlue78,"But in all seriousness, why did you get a letter from him in the first place?"
11-01-2018T17:57:56,TheBeckoner,I invited him to my graduation party to see what would happen lol
11-01-2018T17:58:10,qwe304,so what'd he say?
11-01-2018T17:58:23,Azumachan,Sad.
11-01-2018T17:59:07,TheBeckoner,Its was all generic except for the signiture and some stuff on the front of the envelope
11-01-2018T17:59:24,TheBeckoner,"basically ""congratulations"""
11-01-2018T18:01:34,MidnightBlue78,"well, his loss, I guess"
11-01-2018T18:13:35,TheBeckoner,For sure. He missed an awesome water trampoline.
11-01-2018T18:15:48,TheBeckoner,So how've you been midnight?
11-01-2018T18:37:42,MidnightBlue78,"I've been doing ok, nothing relevant, but things  could be worse, I guess"
11-01-2018T18:37:51,MidnightBlue78,When's your graduation?
11-01-2018T18:41:33,TheBeckoner,Here's the kicker about the invite i sent.

11-01-2018T22:20:41,Ordithus,I had a CT scan once... it was weird.
11-01-2018T22:20:42,SageSaga,they noticed unusual brain activity but that was all- and they couldnt catch it happening so - im just weird i guess medically speaking
11-01-2018T22:20:54,Ordithus,"But, they've stopped, right?"
11-01-2018T22:21:02,Kinipshun,"im like that too, except i have heart issues"
11-01-2018T22:21:12,Unenlagia,You aren't going to see anything unless you can induce the activity
11-01-2018T22:21:13,SageSaga,they stopped when i started drawing and writing for the most part- i havent stopped since sooooo
11-01-2018T22:21:20,MarshallMelon,I've heard of headaches and hallucinations being a side-effect of intense stress and anxiety
11-01-2018T22:21:37,MarshallMelon,Maybe drawing provided an outlet?

11-01-2018T22:27:03,BadFoMo,@Nekonny And a what?!
11-01-2018T22:27:08,MarshallMelon,So basically Green Lantern
11-01-2018T22:27:18,SageSaga,or like Ninja Tom - who's power was to be a Ninja...
11-01-2018T22:27:20,ZizzoGaming,Sounds like Phil has become sentient
11-01-2018T22:27:25,Unenlagia,It's just a turn of phrase...
11-01-2018T22:27:26,SageSaga,and not the Tom you guys know
11-01-2018T22:27:42,Ordithus,"Perhaps Phil, was the other hand.  You split."
11-01-2018T22:27:50,Unenlagia,How many Toms does that make now?
11-01-2018T22:27:51,Serpentfrog,Except those of us who do know Ninja Tom.
11-01-2018T22:27:58,SageSaga,I know many Toms
11-01-2018T22:27:59,Ordithus,And now other Phil lives on in Yosh.

11-01-2018T22:28:31,ZRO4825,But it says comic right on it! D:

11-01-2018T22:28:37,Serpentfrog,You shouldn't use font in a comic. /s
11-01-2018T22:28:45,Nekonny,havent seen him in years though
11-01-2018T22:28:46,MarshallMelon,There's nothing comical about comic sans
11-01-2018T22:28:48,aeoronwah,hand write every word
11-01-2018T22:28:51,Nekonny,shakes fist at nekocon
11-01-2018T22:29:12,MarshallMelon,The only true font is Wingdings anyway
11-01-2018T22:29:19,Bgrmystr2,that thing is op
11-01-2018T22:29:21,SageSaga,"if i told people ""This is Tom and this is Ninja Tom"" they would probably assume Tom was Ninja Tom - that's what makes him a true Ninja Tom"
11-01-2018T22:29:26,MetalAppleSauce,"why do people always look down on comic sans, i personally like it as a font"
11-01-2018T22:29:27,Bgrmystr2,"kill it with fire, marshall"

11-01-2018T22:29:40,Bgrmystr2,tis why everyone uses it

11-01-2018T22:29:52,Unenlagia,A true ninja hides in plain sight.
11-01-2018T22:29:54,MarshallMelon,It's also kinda rough to look at
11-01-2018T22:29:54,Ordithus,NYC in wingdings is a treat
11-01-2018T22:30:03,ZRO4825,"Yeah, people don't look down on it because it's BAD...they look down it because it's just so frickin common."

11-01-2018T22:30:15,Unenlagia,You won't suspect the kid in the track suit of being a hired killer.
11-01-2018T22:30:18,MarshallMelon,Have you ever seen an essay written in Sans? It's so round it looks like it's going to roll off the page.
11-01-2018T22:30:19,Bgrmystr2,"it's not really rough, just simple"
11-01-2018T22:30:26,Ordithus,"Tom, does it have an auto brightness?"
11-01-2018T22:30:32,Nekonny,video connector losse?
11-01-2018T22:30:33,Twokinds,Of course not
11-01-2018T22:30:58,Twokinds,That would be a bad thing to have on a drawing tablet. Anything that messes with colors or brightness could throw things off.
11-01-2018T22:31:04,TheBeckoner,I love you too Ord
11-01-2018T22:31:07,TheBeckoner,lel

11-01-2018T22:31:16,TheBeckoner,Demons.
11-01-2018T22:31:17,SageSaga,does it look like it is happening constantly?
11-01-2018T22:31:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,power issue?
11-01-2018T22:31:24,Bgrmystr2,"it may be a power issue, yeah"
11-01-2018T22:31:25,BadFoMo,"@Twokinds //Troll You're hallucinating this whole stream, Tom. There is no TwoKinds comic."
11-01-2018T22:31:28,Serpentfrog,Demigorgans?
11-01-2018T22:31:31,Twokinds,"No, it's inconsistant"
11-01-2018T22:31:31,Bgrmystr2,XD Fomo no
11-01-2018T22:31:35,Twokinds,It did just snow a lot
11-01-2018T22:31:49,qwe304,you should plug your tablet into a UPS if available
11-01-2018T22:31:49,Ordithus,"Thanks Beck, I think..."
11-01-2018T22:31:54,Unenlagia,Sounds a bit like rolling brown outs
11-01-2018T22:32:01,BluePhantom90,Hmm electrical issues
11-01-2018T22:32:07,Kinipshun,"SORRY TOM! im playing with my ham radio, it's probably interfering with your electricity. ill stop"

11-01-2018T22:32:30,TheBeckoner,It was in reference to your wingding statement
11-01-2018T22:32:32,aeoronwah,"We've got a pretty bad blizzard up here in Cleveland and my power has flickered, so it could be that"
11-01-2018T22:32:40,Twokinds,It stopped I think

11-01-2018T22:33:12,MarshallMelon,You'd think they'd start putting more power cables underground these days
11-01-2018T22:33:22,qwe304,"that is very weird, the ups should protect your electronics from micro-outages and brownouts"
11-01-2018T22:33:29,Ordithus,Gotta keep them away from the mole men
11-01-2018T22:33:31,ZRO4825,"That would require effort, and changing how things are done. Companies don't like either of those points."

11-01-2018T22:33:55,Kinipshun,but seriously i need a ups
11-01-2018T22:34:27,Ordithus,I could really use one at work...
11-01-2018T22:34:52,MarshallMelon,I just use a gasoline generator like every environmentally-conscious person
11-01-2018T22:35:03,Ordithus,I'd be quite annoyed if I was running something and a power outage killed it

11-01-2018T22:36:07,Mustanglvr007,Ugh
11-01-2018T22:36:13,Mustanglvr007,Memes
11-01-2018T22:36:16,Kinipshun,u spelled it wrong
11-01-2018T22:36:20,Kinipshun,it's uganda
11-01-2018T22:36:23,SageSaga,VRChat is a house of memes
11-01-2018T22:36:24,Kinipshun,not ugh
11-01-2018T22:36:38,TheAngelsPlace,true dat
11-01-2018T22:36:40,aeoronwah,VRChat was a mistake
11-01-2018T22:36:43,Serpentfrog,"And promotion of lazy game design, Sage."
11-01-2018T22:36:48,Kinipshun,vrchat IS the meme
11-01-2018T22:36:53,Mustanglvr007,Nononononononononono
11-01-2018T22:36:55,SageSaga,i disagree with that Serp
11-01-2018T22:37:02,MarshallMelon,VR's still in the experimental stage. It can be forgiven
11-01-2018T22:37:04,SageSaga,its not a game
11-01-2018T22:37:13,aeoronwah,^
11-01-2018T22:37:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,its like 3d discord
11-01-2018T22:37:18,MoonDance,Being in a world were memes lives is terrifying from what I seen
11-01-2018T22:37:18,SageSaga,its called VRChat - not VRGaming
11-01-2018T22:37:36,MarshallMelon,I always viewed VRChat as more of a proof of concept than anything
11-01-2018T22:37:37,Unenlagia,But do you kno de way?
11-01-2018T22:37:41,Kinipshun,"vrchat is kinda like that ""PlayStation Home"" thing. complete failure (thanks sony), but a great idea"
11-01-2018T22:38:22,MarshallMelon,"It's like, its whole purpose was to prove that lots of people could connect while using VR sets at the same time"
11-01-2018T22:38:28,Mustanglvr007,But did you know all modern memes are fokin ded?????
11-01-2018T22:38:43,Kinipshun,V
11-01-2018T22:38:57,Serpentfrog,"No, that's the Logan Paul meme specifically."
11-01-2018T22:39:00,Kinipshun,^
11-01-2018T22:39:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"De-Whey O's, I want 7 please"
11-01-2018T22:39:06,SageSaga,VRChat is also pretty amazing when it comes down to it- and as the tech gets better and VR controllers let you better determine facial changes and hand motions and finger movements its going to make animations easier especially for people that cant
11-01-2018T22:39:09,Tharkis,Nekony knows de whey
11-01-2018T22:39:10,SageSaga,afford Mocap rigs
11-01-2018T22:39:21,HeresyArtStream,I wonder what Ready Player One would be like if it was a realistic depiction of VRchat?
11-01-2018T22:39:30,Unenlagia,yeah that is some pretty cool tech
11-01-2018T22:39:42,MarshallMelon,By the time mocap integration becomes common we'll probably be on the verge of full neural integration
11-01-2018T22:39:50,SageSaga,i do like the Ready Player One VR Chat Memes
11-01-2018T22:39:51,MarshallMelon,"We Black Mirror now, bois"

11-01-2018T22:40:34,MarshallMelon,"They probably wouldn't learn anything new, Serp"
11-01-2018T22:40:40,Bgrmystr2,"It's a nora card, Palm"
11-01-2018T22:40:40,MarshallMelon,Modern CCTV tech is scary
11-01-2018T22:41:09,MadMaxton,It's the christmas drawing where she gives Raine the sweater she made when she was younger
11-01-2018T22:41:13,Bgrmystr2,"He's completing a sketch he already did earlier. Color, background, shading."

11-01-2018T22:41:43,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Ah okay.  Also, and this has puzzled me a few times: why is it that when Tom (or anyone of the others are drawing) when they draw a black line, it disappears and they redraw it again.  Like just what happened a few seconds ago."
11-01-2018T22:42:17,Bgrmystr2,"that's called ""Undo"""
11-01-2018T22:42:22,MarshallMelon,Either redoing an error or switching between layers
11-01-2018T22:42:22,Ordithus,Ctrl+Z
11-01-2018T22:42:46,PalmettoPathfinder1,"I figured it was either undoing, or layers, but I wasn't 100% sure.  One reason why I asked."
11-01-2018T22:42:54,Ordithus,Things you can do with digital art!
11-01-2018T22:42:54,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, why would stuff you write disappear after you erase it? lol :P"
11-01-2018T22:42:56,ZRO4825,The Undo button is god.
11-01-2018T22:43:04,Serpentfrog,"""redoing an error"" would be a bit counterproductive, no?"
11-01-2018T22:43:19,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Well, it could be switching between layers too."
11-01-2018T22:43:21,Ordithus,"For science, Serp."
11-01-2018T22:43:22,ZRO4825,"idk Serp, some people have second and third kids..."
11-01-2018T22:43:28,MarshallMelon,O dang

11-01-2018T22:44:06,Bgrmystr2,"also, it's sometimes good to reproduce an error"
11-01-2018T22:44:14,TheAngelsPlace,gud
11-01-2018T22:44:16,Unenlagia,Can't complain

11-01-2018T22:45:50,MadMaxton,is testing
11-01-2018T22:45:51,SageSaga,Most color blind people wouldnt say something is purple because purple is one of the most common colors color blind people cant see

11-01-2018T22:45:55,MetalAppleSauce,finds out a number of people here are canadian
11-01-2018T22:46:03,Serpentfrog,It is a notably hard to read colour.
11-01-2018T22:46:11,MarshallMelon,I swear I can see a tinge of red in there
11-01-2018T22:46:16,PalmettoPathfinder1,My dad is partially color blind. He can't see red very well.
11-01-2018T22:46:16,MarshallMelon,Maybe I need to get some sleep

11-01-2018T22:52:37,FloofyPatootie,ewwww
11-01-2018T22:52:43,SageSaga,oh Snap Tom
11-01-2018T22:52:46,MadMaxton,hol up!
11-01-2018T22:52:46,BadFoMo,Banjo music?
11-01-2018T22:53:03,PalmettoPathfinder1,"Wait....Oh that makes sense.  In a very lewd, and creepy, incestuous way"
11-01-2018T22:53:03,aeoronwah,Is that new official lore?
11-01-2018T22:53:05,Serpentfrog,This is why the subspecies keidran must be eliminated.
11-01-2018T22:53:06,MetalAppleSauce,i still think wolf-red can still become canon
11-01-2018T22:53:31,Ordithus,Pretty sure he and Maren are the cousins
11-01-2018T22:53:46,Ordithus,Maybe they're all cousins...
11-01-2018T22:53:51,BadFoMo,@MetalAppleSauce I like to think that too.
11-01-2018T22:53:59,Serpentfrog,We're all cousins now.
11-01-2018T22:54:10,Ordithus,"Thanks, Euchre."
11-01-2018T22:54:15,Unenlagia,COUSIN!
11-01-2018T22:54:38,MetalAppleSauce,especially with nora's handy dandy trap
11-01-2018T22:54:51,Serpentfrog,But is her trap gay?
11-01-2018T22:54:52,MetalAppleSauce,who knows what red's initial intentions will be when he sees rose
11-01-2018T22:55:11,Tegani,"Is the world's name ""Alabama""? Then they might indeed all be cousins. :P"
11-01-2018T22:55:21,SageSaga,"""I cant believe humans are so racist against Keidrans!"" Humans - ""Remember when those Keidrans came to our village every year to eat our newborns? So glad we formed the Templar and put a stop to that"""
11-01-2018T22:55:40,Twokinds,"It's the middle ages, pretty much everyone in small villages are related."
11-01-2018T22:55:54,MetalAppleSauce,"i mean with a country name like ""Mekkan""..."
11-01-2018T22:56:01,Serpentfrog,Even the dogs and people
11-01-2018T22:56:11,MetalAppleSauce,even the dragons
11-01-2018T22:56:13,Tegani,very true. Moving across the continent is REALLY tough at that level of tech/transport
11-01-2018T22:56:34,Unenlagia,yeah good luck with that
11-01-2018T22:56:45,Ordithus,Hmm... that makes me think.
11-01-2018T22:56:57,Serpentfrog,Do you see how far India moved before there was even that tech? Get good.
11-01-2018T22:57:06,Unenlagia,Care to elucidate?
11-01-2018T22:57:06,Ordithus,"I suppose few ""mainland"" people ever get to see the Basidian Isles."
11-01-2018T22:57:14,Ordithus,"Even fewer would return, alive."
11-01-2018T22:57:34,MetalAppleSauce,apparently they don't see much of (whatever that one place they're all going to is called)
11-01-2018T22:57:38,MetalAppleSauce,either
11-01-2018T22:57:49,Ordithus,The main cast sure gets around
11-01-2018T22:57:54,Unenlagia,"Considering how xenophobic the islanders are, maybe that's for the best"
11-01-2018T22:57:56,Ordithus,lol Ron!
11-01-2018T22:58:15,Tharkis,"hah perfectc, Lee was the best"
11-01-2018T22:58:21,BadFoMo,El Ray?
11-01-2018T22:58:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I never knew how much i wanted light sabor Bruce lee until now
11-01-2018T22:58:33,Serpentfrog,The cure to xenophobia is Xcom.
11-01-2018T22:58:35,BLADEDGE,LIGHT-CHUCKS!
11-01-2018T22:58:37,Ordithus,Light saber nunchucks? :ptv-nope:
11-01-2018T22:58:48,MetalAppleSauce,My favourite light-weapon
11-01-2018T22:58:57,Twokinds,I'm being distracted by Ron's stream
11-01-2018T22:59:04,Tharkis,worth it
11-01-2018T22:59:09,BadFoMo,I... think I like this.
11-01-2018T22:59:10,Bgrmystr2,hahaha ikr
11-01-2018T22:59:11,Tharkis,lightsaber bruce lee ftw
11-01-2018T22:59:20,Nekonny,"Sorry ^^"""
11-01-2018T22:59:33,Serpentfrog,Is the Death Star effectively a giant light saber that can only be ignited for a small moment?
11-01-2018T22:59:35,Nekonny,makes lightsaber sounds
11-01-2018T22:59:43,MetalAppleSauce,serp no
11-01-2018T22:59:44,BadFoMo,Play some more?
11-01-2018T22:59:48,SageSaga,i thought the cure to xenophobia was Asari?
11-01-2018T23:00:00,Twokinds,SWORD-CHUCKS YO!
11-01-2018T23:00:14,ZRO4825,8-bit Theater &lt;3
11-01-2018T23:00:16,Serpentfrog,Why don't they have light rapiers?
11-01-2018T23:00:17,Unenlagia,"Yo, lasersword-chucks."
11-01-2018T23:00:27,Unenlagia,"In old canon, they did."
11-01-2018T23:00:28,Ordithus,Or light axes
11-01-2018T23:00:31,Twokinds,Heheh
11-01-2018T23:00:33,Unenlagia,Then Disney said no.
11-01-2018T23:00:37,Twokinds,I'm amazed someone got that
11-01-2018T23:00:38,SageSaga,Lightsabers are already Rapiers
11-01-2018T23:00:39,ZRO4825,"Because given the weight difference, pretty much every lightsaber IS a rapier."
11-01-2018T23:00:48,Serpentfrog,Sabers =/ rapiers
11-01-2018T23:00:56,Nekonny,man its been a while since 8-bit
11-01-2018T23:01:01,ZRO4825,And Dooku's fighting style was almost a rapier style. Almost. Not quite.
11-01-2018T23:01:08,MetalAppleSauce,It's only LIGHT rape... wait... are we not talking about the same thing?
11-01-2018T23:01:16,Mihari,saber is just the term for the weapon.
11-01-2018T23:01:27,Unenlagia,"One of those is a felony, MAS."
11-01-2018T23:01:33,Serpentfrog,A rapier being a distinct weapon.
11-01-2018T23:01:36,Mihari,Just as they call doubled edged light sabers that instead of light staves
11-01-2018T23:01:45,Ordithus,Dooku's flghting style was fancy
11-01-2018T23:01:56,ZRO4825,"Technically all lightsaber fighting styles are fancy, lol"
11-01-2018T23:02:07,Unenlagia,Ridiculously fancy
11-01-2018T23:02:07,ZRO4825,There's a LOT of unnecessary motion in just about all of'em XD
11-01-2018T23:02:08,MarshallMelon,Except The Senate's
11-01-2018T23:02:17,MarshallMelon,He just tried spinning. It's a good trick.
11-01-2018T23:02:19,Ordithus,"Very true, ZRO"
11-01-2018T23:02:25,SageSaga,well in terms of Lore its not unnecessary motion
11-01-2018T23:02:35,ZRO4825,"Yeah, true, they're letting their movements be guided by the Force."
11-01-2018T23:02:40,Serpentfrog,"With weapons being laser based, why doesn't everyone have glass armor?"
11-01-2018T23:02:51,ZRO4825,Melts too easy?
11-01-2018T23:02:53,MetalAppleSauce,serp...
11-01-2018T23:02:57,MarshallMelon,I'd opt for reflective plating
11-01-2018T23:03:00,SageSaga,the idea behind the crazy ninja style fights was that these jedi warriors were reading each others every moves so they had to do unexpected things to be harder to read
11-01-2018T23:03:03,MarshallMelon,Like Phasma
11-01-2018T23:03:08,Unenlagia,"Again, old canon asked the question of what can't be cut by lightsabers"
11-01-2018T23:03:08,Nekonny,reis blaster should not have blown a hole in the side of a stone hut.
11-01-2018T23:03:21,Nekonny,they are not that powerful
11-01-2018T23:03:26,Anohrak,SPOILER ALERT...
11-01-2018T23:03:26,MetalAppleSauce,"oh yeah, rei, she existed"
11-01-2018T23:03:31,ZRO4825,"Rei? Oh, wait, you're probably talking something from the Disney movies :joy:"
11-01-2018T23:03:32,MarshallMelon,Aren't blasters plasma based?
11-01-2018T23:03:34,Serpentfrog,Lightsabers. Will it blend?
11-01-2018T23:03:34,Anohrak,...SOMEONE TOUCHES A LIGHTSABER
11-01-2018T23:03:48,SageSaga,they are that powerful Ron
11-01-2018T23:03:51,Nekonny,its almost mid january
11-01-2018T23:03:51,MetalAppleSauce,"yeah, dooku's hands"
11-01-2018T23:04:00,SageSaga,they dont go through Durasteel but they go through rock
11-01-2018T23:04:02,Twokinds,"They should make a lightsaber, except instead, the blade shoots out, like a projectile, so you can use it at range."
11-01-2018T23:04:03,Bgrmystr2,"Lightsabers are plasma-based too, Marshall."
11-01-2018T23:04:04,Nekonny,most of the time they barely char walls
11-01-2018T23:04:10,Bgrmystr2,They just use a field so it doesn't escape.
11-01-2018T23:04:11,SageSaga,Durasteel walls bro
11-01-2018T23:04:13,ZRO4825,I wonder if the new ones are on Netflix yet :thinking:
11-01-2018T23:04:19,Nekonny,GENIUS TOM
11-01-2018T23:04:21,Unenlagia,"Hey Tom, Rebels did that"
11-01-2018T23:04:23,Ordithus,"Rogue One is, ZRO"
11-01-2018T23:04:36,Nekonny,pew pew!
11-01-2018T23:04:36,Tharkis,the original Porg concept art was... not kind to porgs with regard to light sabers   https://i.redd.it/ka9gdyex2n401.jpg
11-01-2018T23:04:49,Tharkis,oops sorry
11-01-2018T23:04:53,PalmettoPathfinder1,My boss's wife made him a lightsaber replica.  It even makes sound and lights up.
11-01-2018T23:04:54,MarshallMelon,Dang Sage is on a rampage today
11-01-2018T23:04:57,Serpentfrog,What are lghtsaber handles made of? Make ships out of that.
11-01-2018T23:04:58,Nekonny,"hey, at least they recycled that scene!"
11-01-2018T23:05:28,SageSaga,enforcing rules is not being on a rampage
11-01-2018T23:05:29,Unenlagia,Same stuff as jet engines I suppose
11-01-2018T23:05:34,SageSaga,also Ron- no talking about the movie
11-01-2018T23:05:35,WarToWin,hi am i late
11-01-2018T23:05:45,MarshallMelon,"If the emitter holds the plasma in an EM field like I think it does, Serp, then the hilt doesn't need to be durable"
11-01-2018T23:05:46,Tegani,recycled Porgs?  Chewie tried that...
11-01-2018T23:05:51,Bgrmystr2,"Why, Serp? It isn't like the handle is special or anything"
11-01-2018T23:05:56,Anohrak,Zen x Kat
11-01-2018T23:05:56,MarshallMelon,Just heat resistant
11-01-2018T23:06:00,Anohrak,Does anyone agree
11-01-2018T23:06:08,Unenlagia,Nat certainly does
11-01-2018T23:06:08,ZizzoGaming,No

11-01-2018T23:06:37,Bgrmystr2,"We are not google, Fomo"
11-01-2018T23:06:39,MetalAppleSauce,Na'rella would like to speak with you

11-01-2018T23:06:42,Bgrmystr2,maybe try it instead of us. xD
11-01-2018T23:06:45,Serpentfrog,Porgs: like Pong but different.

11-01-2018T23:07:08,aeoronwah,A porg is a computer generated animal used to remove puffins from the movie
11-01-2018T23:07:23,Tharkis,yep
11-01-2018T23:07:31,Anohrak,@MadMaxton ay lmao
11-01-2018T23:07:48,PalmettoPathfinder1,I like the vulptices.
11-01-2018T23:07:50,MetalAppleSauce,I said before to someone... Everyone X Everyone
11-01-2018T23:07:50,Unenlagia,because they couldn't remove the puffins
11-01-2018T23:07:52,Tegani,Then WTF was the siren covering up? :P
11-01-2018T23:08:16,BadFoMo,Puffins?
11-01-2018T23:08:19,SageSaga,Guys- no talking about the movie

11-01-2018T23:08:40,aeoronwah,actual birds
11-01-2018T23:08:46,Ordithus,LIttle birds
11-01-2018T23:08:49,PalmettoPathfinder1,Although everyone is up in arms over the hyperspace ramming scene.  Saying: we never saw that before in Star Wars!  This changes everything we know about combat in Star Wars!  WAAAAAH!
11-01-2018T23:08:56,MetalAppleSauce,"did i say you weren't included, serp? &gt;:3"

11-01-2018T23:10:28,SageSaga,I just said -No talking about the movie
11-01-2018T23:10:35,Anohrak,In star wars there is air on a planet
11-01-2018T23:10:40,ZoieFalcona,A couple of people asked not to spoil it since they haven't seen it

11-01-2018T23:11:06,Ordithus,"That's what tomorrow is for, Ron."

11-01-2018T23:20:01,Ordithus,"heh, Ron."
11-01-2018T23:20:08,MarshallMelon,Trolling can be funny. Greifing not so much.
11-01-2018T23:20:16,MarshallMelon,*Griefing
11-01-2018T23:20:36,PalmettoPathfinder1,Trolling can be consideredd a form of cyberbullying.  Funny thing actually I got emails from my state senators about the net neutrality thing.

11-01-2018T23:32:02,aeoronwah,"Well, Traps are gay, and Tommy Wiseau is pretty much irrelevant at this point"
11-01-2018T23:32:03,Nekonny,"^_^"""

11-01-2018T23:32:55,Bgrmystr2,"it's not the trap that is gay, but the user who likes the trap, usually speaking."
11-01-2018T23:32:58,MarvTheHugPharaoh,unsteddy have you ever been mistaken for a man
11-01-2018T23:33:05,DJSylveon,Some traps have no gender because they make sure bears dont have legs or something
11-01-2018T23:33:07,unsteddyphoenix,Youd be surprised
11-01-2018T23:33:07,ZRO4825,Only when he's a pretty princess.
11-01-2018T23:33:13,TheBeckoner,wot
11-01-2018T23:33:13,MetalAppleSauce,"i thought he was until now, thanks marv"
11-01-2018T23:33:18,SageSaga,it's simple- what if the trap is - not gay? What if the Trap wants women? Or specifically lesbians?
11-01-2018T23:33:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
11-01-2018T23:33:26,Bgrmystr2,rofl DJ
11-01-2018T23:33:31,TheBeckoner,IF the bear has legs then traps are gay and pineapples have teeth
11-01-2018T23:33:42,unsteddyphoenix,"The question is more ""is liking traps gay"" and it's just been abbreviated to ""are traps gay"""
11-01-2018T23:33:54,aeoronwah,"I... I don't know how to answer that, Sage."
11-01-2018T23:33:55,Combak,Isn't the term for that Bishi Sage?
11-01-2018T23:34:04,TheBeckoner,Is liking wahmen gay?

11-01-2018T23:34:21,unsteddyphoenix,Noone cares about the traps preferences when they have a mental dillemma going on
11-01-2018T23:34:30,ZizzoGaming,"Only if are wahmen, @TheBeckoner"
11-01-2018T23:34:32,unsteddyphoenix,Is being a man gay?

11-01-2018T23:34:42,Twokinds,...
11-01-2018T23:34:43,Nekonny,are you happy
11-01-2018T23:34:45,SageSaga,a Trap is usually called that because they are there to trick the viewer into thinking they are a different sex
11-01-2018T23:34:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,does beeing gay make you a man
11-01-2018T23:34:54,unsteddyphoenix,Like Keith
11-01-2018T23:34:55,SageSaga,by that definition- a trap is not gay

11-01-2018T23:51:19,Mihari,It's a measuable quantity
11-01-2018T23:51:21,Nekonny,it's the lack of an amount
11-01-2018T23:51:26,Bgrmystr2,no it isn't
11-01-2018T23:51:27,DrChangsta,It amounts to nothing.

11-01-2018T23:51:37,Bgrmystr2,nothing is an amount. You can have none of something.
11-01-2018T23:51:38,Nekonny,"therefore it is not a n amount, it's the opposite of an amount"
