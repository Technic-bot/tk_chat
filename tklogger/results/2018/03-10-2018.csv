03-10-2018T00:55:43,Twokinds,Well my house was empty
03-10-2018T00:55:45,Twokinds,Had to stock up
03-10-2018T00:57:52,unsteddyphoenix,Did you bring it all in to the house in one trip?
03-10-2018T01:01:02,unsteddyphoenix,Also did you get Holly?
03-10-2018T01:02:13,Twokinds,Not yet
03-10-2018T01:02:16,Twokinds,We pick her up tomorrow
03-10-2018T01:03:41,unsteddyphoenix,Aw jeez I hope she's ok.
03-10-2018T01:03:48,unsteddyphoenix,Did you miss her?
03-10-2018T01:11:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Did you actually just go grocery shopping
03-10-2018T01:12:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Or like use a grocery service
03-10-2018T01:13:59,Twokinds,I went myself.
03-10-2018T01:14:23,Twokinds,It was a bit late for a delivery.
03-10-2018T01:14:26,SpazztasticKiwi,L√© gasp
03-10-2018T01:14:50,Twokinds,Do I miss Holly? Hm...
03-10-2018T01:15:12,Twokinds,>_>
03-10-2018T01:15:22,Twokinds,I'm sure it'll be nice to see her again.
03-10-2018T01:15:33,unsteddyphoenix,I'll take that as an unconflicted yes
03-10-2018T01:15:52,Dadrobit,"Ayyy, welcome back."
03-10-2018T01:15:53,SpazztasticKiwi,To experience the demands for attention and food once more
03-10-2018T01:16:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Such memories
03-10-2018T01:16:13,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah! :D
03-10-2018T01:16:22,SpazztasticKiwi,And cat hair
03-10-2018T01:17:01,SpazztasticKiwi,And allergies to return in full force and remind you that you have a very active respiratory system
03-10-2018T01:17:13,unsteddyphoenix,y-yeah...
03-10-2018T01:18:16,iliar,"Welcome back, Tom."
03-10-2018T01:18:57,SpazztasticKiwi,What was that place with the waterfall called that y‚Äôall visited
03-10-2018T01:20:21,unsteddyphoenix,Ooh I do hope to see pictures
03-10-2018T01:20:28,unsteddyphoenix,Particularly of Seoul
03-10-2018T01:22:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark posted some of you want to go look at what he shot
03-10-2018T01:23:00,SpazztasticKiwi,if
03-10-2018T01:23:07,unsteddyphoenix,on twitter?
03-10-2018T01:23:20,SpazztasticKiwi,And instagram
03-10-2018T01:23:30,unsteddyphoenix,Ahh
03-10-2018T01:23:38,unsteddyphoenix,Man I need to make an instagram
03-10-2018T01:23:44,unsteddyphoenix,All the cool kids have them
03-10-2018T01:24:39,Dadrobit,TIL: I am not a cool kid.
03-10-2018T01:25:00,Dadrobit,"To be honest, I probably should have had that figured out sooner."
03-10-2018T01:25:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"Most of what what he shared in insta was in stories, which are temporary and go away after a bit but there‚Äôs screenshots and recordings on Tumblr"
03-10-2018T01:25:15,SpazztasticKiwi,(shocker)
03-10-2018T01:25:35,unsteddyphoenix,This is getting complicated
03-10-2018T01:26:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Best bet is Twitter
03-10-2018T01:26:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Some nice pictures there
03-10-2018T01:27:20,unsteddyphoenix,I'll check it out
03-10-2018T01:28:59,unsteddyphoenix,Also dad if you just make one you'll instantly become cool again so.
03-10-2018T01:31:39,Dadrobit,"Single most boring Instagram ever. All just Taco Bell taco omelettes, and fish stick burritos."
03-10-2018T01:32:13,unsteddyphoenix,"I'd follow it, but i'd never ADMIT that I follow it"
03-10-2018T01:33:11,Dadrobit,lol
03-10-2018T01:34:02,unsteddyphoenix,https://imgur.com/EhKsT0F
03-10-2018T01:34:05,unsteddyphoenix,I got distracted
03-10-2018T01:34:38,Dadrobit,Gold
03-10-2018T01:40:01,Dadrobit,be back in a bit.
03-10-2018T01:40:29,unsteddyphoenix,o/
03-10-2018T01:43:15,Twokinds,I'm sick too
03-10-2018T01:44:35,unsteddyphoenix,Really? That sucks. Same sickness?
03-10-2018T01:44:44,unsteddyphoenix,did you buy chicken noodle soup?
03-10-2018T01:49:06,TorqueEmUp,"Yep, probably one person on that plane was sick, and being enclosed in a pressurized tin can for hours on end."
03-10-2018T01:50:08,unsteddyphoenix,"Nah, unlikely. It was probably because they were away from their pets for too long"
03-10-2018T01:50:55,TorqueEmUp,"That honestly makes no sense, unless you're saying they have pet allergies and got sick once they were back with their pets."
03-10-2018T01:51:36,Bgrmystr2,"Torque, you need to use Anti-logic when dealing with someone who lives on the upsidedown island."
03-10-2018T01:51:40,unsteddyphoenix,"I predict that, now that they will be back with their pets they will eventually recover"
03-10-2018T01:54:24,SpazztasticKiwi,All that travel combined with staying together all that time AND being in another country. I know Mark gets travel sick basically every time. Makes since you and y‚Äôall‚Äôs mom get a bit foggy too
03-10-2018T01:54:29,SpazztasticKiwi,üç≤ but here
03-10-2018T01:55:09,SpazztasticKiwi,sense
03-10-2018T01:58:26,TorqueEmUp,I still say it was the plane. :P
03-10-2018T02:01:19,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, they went through China.. and they're not known for having a very germ-free environment. But the very little time they likely spent there makes it a low probability lol"
03-10-2018T02:54:08,Dadrobit,Aaaand I'm back.
03-10-2018T02:54:44,Dadrobit,Pops came over to use my equipment to set up some lessons for his classes tomorrow.
03-10-2018T02:55:42,Dadrobit,"Has to go to the doctor, didn't just want to leave his kids with a sub to watch a Modern Marvels episode or whatever."
03-10-2018T02:57:49,unsteddyphoenix,Aw but watching tv in class was the best class
03-10-2018T02:59:13,Dadrobit,He's actually been out of school on doctor's orders for a month already due to stress. Watching useless videos is all his kids have been doing for most of that time.
03-10-2018T02:59:32,Dadrobit,Monday was his first day he was allowed back.
03-10-2018T03:00:39,Dadrobit,"The district fucked him over with his shop. They wanted to give him a new shop over the summer, but it's been absolutely plagued with problems."
03-10-2018T03:01:22,unsteddyphoenix,No good deed?
03-10-2018T03:01:33,Dadrobit,"Completely foreseeable problems that he was warning them about since day one, but they ignored him and now it's a complete fucking mess."
03-10-2018T03:02:28,Dadrobit,"Like, putting in a 5 foot brick wall in the middle of the shop. Why? Who the fuck knows, not the building planner especially."
03-10-2018T03:02:43,Dadrobit,And the roof leaks like a sieve.
03-10-2018T03:03:27,Dadrobit,"Oh, and it's a weld shop right? It'd be nice to have some welders in there right? Nope. No welders two months into classes still."
03-10-2018T03:04:43,Dadrobit,Pops has been stressed to high fuck about all of this it made him physically ill. Dude lost 40 pounds freaking out trying to get through to the admin at the city how they've made it impossible for him to teach.
03-10-2018T03:04:49,unsteddyphoenix,a 5 foot brick wall? Was it...supporting...something?
03-10-2018T03:05:13,Dadrobit,"Nope, just a wall. For no reason. Right in the middle of the shop."
03-10-2018T03:06:30,Dadrobit,"He was there when the contractors had just put it in and asked them why they put it in. ""I dunno what it's for. It was in the blueprints we got..."""
03-10-2018T03:06:56,unsteddyphoenix,That's...so weird.
03-10-2018T03:07:16,Dadrobit,It's incompetency on a whole 'nother level.
03-10-2018T03:07:41,Dadrobit,He's decided this is his last year because of it. Retiring just a few years early.
03-10-2018T03:08:18,Dadrobit,"Same for mom, she's fed up with admin bullshit on her end as well. They're just done with all of it."
03-10-2018T03:08:22,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI refuse to let your stupid bleed on me‚Äù
03-10-2018T03:08:38,unsteddyphoenix,"A classic ""fuck this shit, im out""?"
03-10-2018T03:08:43,Dadrobit,Exactly.
03-10-2018T03:09:15,Dadrobit,"He's still probably going to keep being a professor at the college, but he's done with high school."
03-10-2018T03:09:31,Dadrobit,"Which sucks, because he fucking loves teaching his kids."
03-10-2018T03:09:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Tell that contractor he‚Äôs the flower of manhood
03-10-2018T03:09:43,SpazztasticKiwi,A blooming idiot
03-10-2018T03:09:58,Dadrobit,Terminal Cranial Rectosis.
03-10-2018T03:10:29,Dadrobit,"He actually sends kids to the nurse for that by the way, fucking classic."
03-10-2018T03:10:30,unsteddyphoenix,"You should just have a kid, then he can teach that"
03-10-2018T03:10:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚ÄúYou really are 31 flavors of dumb, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù"
03-10-2018T03:11:10,Dadrobit,"Nah, he has like, 30-ish grandkids by now, that probably enough."
03-10-2018T03:11:15,Dadrobit,that's*
03-10-2018T03:11:23,Dadrobit,(mild exaggeration)
03-10-2018T03:11:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"‚ÄúIf brains were gasoline, you couldn‚Äôt power a fleas go cart one lap around a Cheerio‚Äù"
03-10-2018T03:11:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I have more
03-10-2018T03:12:40,Dadrobit,"Nah, he doesn't mince words. He just calls people fucktards to their face."
03-10-2018T03:12:43,unsteddyphoenix,Only 25
03-10-2018T03:12:53,Dadrobit,Gimme a sec to count.
03-10-2018T03:13:42,Dadrobit,I think there's 12?
03-10-2018T03:14:02,Dadrobit,Plus my little brother wants some of his own in the future as well.
03-10-2018T03:15:10,unsteddyphoenix,He almost has a class there already
03-10-2018T03:15:24,Dadrobit,"Pfft, classes are like 40 kids now"
03-10-2018T03:15:33,Dadrobit,It's actually nuts.
03-10-2018T03:15:43,Dadrobit,Part of why my mother is quitting.
03-10-2018T03:15:47,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah thats true actually
03-10-2018T03:16:00,unsteddyphoenix,My poor mother cant quit
03-10-2018T03:16:07,unsteddyphoenix,But they did go on strike the other day
03-10-2018T03:16:24,Dadrobit,She literally doesn't have enough chairs in her class for the number of kids they gave her.
03-10-2018T03:17:37,Dadrobit,"Because they gave her a standard number of kids, but then they also gave her all of the IEPs and SpEds as well ""so they can be graded evenly."""
03-10-2018T03:19:19,unsteddyphoenix,HOw...progressive?
03-10-2018T03:19:21,unsteddyphoenix,Oof
03-10-2018T03:19:43,unsteddyphoenix,True equality
03-10-2018T03:20:35,Dadrobit,She made the mistake of being recognized for being a good teacher for those kids.
03-10-2018T04:04:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm watching Thumbellina üé•
03-10-2018T04:04:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Forgot how old it was
03-10-2018T04:52:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Night folks
03-10-2018T04:53:12,unsteddyphoenix,gnight
03-10-2018T04:53:51,Dadrobit,o/
03-10-2018T15:26:08,Bgrmystr2,"probably not if the only thing it could do is change your body to be backwards, upsidedown, and inside out"
03-10-2018T15:26:17,Bgrmystr2,cuz I'm.. not quite sure anyone would want that. XD
03-10-2018T15:26:43,SpazztasticKiwi,You never know. There‚Äôs some weird ones out there
03-10-2018T15:26:56,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh: you ain't lyin haha
03-10-2018T15:27:01,SpazztasticKiwi,But I‚Äôm talking more about a body editor app
03-10-2018T15:27:15,Bgrmystr2,yah that'd sell for big bucks
03-10-2018T15:27:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Like the sims - there‚Äôd be purple people with horns
03-10-2018T15:28:31,Bgrmystr2,yeah.. then you'd have someone in the middle of town just..
03-10-2018T15:28:34,SpazztasticKiwi,Although there‚Äôs already eye tattooing and body modification like the doughnut forehead so...
03-10-2018T15:30:00,Bgrmystr2,"Someone waving their arm in the air ""Fooweh! Fooweh! Hasuwassa maofoonasablahhh!@"" and then collapse on the ground sleeping.."
03-10-2018T15:30:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Drugs. Hell of a trip
03-10-2018T15:31:07,Bgrmystr2,xD
03-10-2018T15:40:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I need to check back in on my sims. Another family had a kid
03-10-2018T15:41:13,SpazztasticKiwi,And I moved two families to new houses so they‚Äôre basically all standing on empty lots
03-10-2018T15:42:44,Bgrmystr2,I haven't played The Sims since I had a working CD drive.. and the last time I had a working one was..
03-10-2018T15:42:54,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, 03?"
03-10-2018T15:43:04,Bgrmystr2,ish?
03-10-2018T15:43:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"I‚Äôm talking about my app. With the app, it‚Äôs real time, so even if your not on, their needs are changing"
03-10-2018T15:43:46,Bgrmystr2,so basically around when it came out
03-10-2018T15:43:50,SpazztasticKiwi,They apparently can‚Äôt die though
03-10-2018T15:44:10,Bgrmystr2,"lol that's kinda boring, what point is a game if you're not actually playing the thing"
03-10-2018T15:44:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Lots of life stages though
03-10-2018T15:44:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"Baby, toddler, preteen, teen, adult, senior, dead"
03-10-2018T15:45:16,SpazztasticKiwi,And there‚Äôs pets
03-10-2018T15:45:32,Bgrmystr2,Yeah I'll just take the first game and be done with it. Overcomplication doesn't equal better.
03-10-2018T15:46:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I like the computer game but I can‚Äôt take my computer with me everywhere. So these guys are my pocket sims
03-10-2018T15:46:46,Bgrmystr2,xD you can keep em
03-10-2018T15:46:53,SpazztasticKiwi,One thing I‚Äôm debating is getting sims 3 vs 4
03-10-2018T15:47:34,CommanderTrace,hello :ptv-greetings::grinning:
03-10-2018T15:47:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"I know Mark‚Äôs played both, so I may try asking him at a con or with that text thing"
03-10-2018T15:58:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I also don‚Äôt play many computer games because my laptop generally stays at home & I prefer movies and YouTube if I‚Äôm just sitting at home
03-10-2018T17:07:21,MidNightBlue78,i just watched a video on Mark's IG where they were carrying their grandma on her wheelchair down some stairs
03-10-2018T17:07:36,MidNightBlue78,And Tom looks just like her üòä
03-10-2018T18:12:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Sister got me a black cat tea light holder

03-10-2018T20:11:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I asked for a ton of sauce at taco bell. They gave me near 35 packets
03-10-2018T20:14:25,MidNightBlue78,"well, you asked for a lot"
03-10-2018T20:15:19,MidNightBlue78,Customer satisfaction guaranteed üëåüèº
03-10-2018T20:18:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll quote Mark: ‚ÄúI guess I got what I asked for‚Äù
03-10-2018T20:25:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"And as for cats doing stupid, I‚Äôve caught Bagheera chewing on plastic"
