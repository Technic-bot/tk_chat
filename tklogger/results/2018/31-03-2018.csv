31-03-2018T04:41:52,NightMeaty22,hello?
31-03-2018T04:45:18,Bgrmystr2,Noone's home. Try next door.
31-03-2018T04:50:04,hunter117x,when does the stream start
31-03-2018T04:51:14,BadFoMo,More or less 4:00 PM EST.
31-03-2018T04:51:22,hunter117x,thanks
31-03-2018T04:51:24,Bgrmystr2,Schedule is at the top of the chat as always.
31-03-2018T11:08:10,Vatruvius,lol...there are far too many people that ask that Bgr.
31-03-2018T13:05:18,Bgrmystr2,"Tis why my answer will always be the same, Vatru."
31-03-2018T13:05:26,Bgrmystr2,It's been there for over a year I think
31-03-2018T13:05:29,Bgrmystr2,same place.
31-03-2018T13:34:16,TheBeckoner,Too many mobile noobs
31-03-2018T13:51:15,Bgrmystr2,for all the people who think they can just use a phone or tablet and replace their home computer.. this is one of of the many examples they are wrong
31-03-2018T13:51:40,Bgrmystr2,a simple ease of access
31-03-2018T13:51:44,Bgrmystr2,a lack of question needed
31-03-2018T14:16:23,Twokinds,"Darn you, Easter"
31-03-2018T14:16:52,Twokinds,My family said their wasn't any plans but then last minute messaged me inviting me over at 6.
31-03-2018T14:16:52,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
31-03-2018T14:16:59,Twokinds,Now I'm not sure what to do.
31-03-2018T14:17:31,ThingsAreMoving,do what you want
31-03-2018T14:17:38,ThingsAreMoving,it's not like we will hold a grudge
31-03-2018T14:17:43,Bgrmystr2,right
31-03-2018T14:17:45,ThingsAreMoving,it's easter
31-03-2018T14:17:49,Tylertt,It's your coice at the end of the day
31-03-2018T14:18:04,WereKeidran,Hello y'all
31-03-2018T14:18:05,Twokinds,We do have one extra week this month
31-03-2018T14:18:17,Twokinds,It's 4 sundays in March
31-03-2018T14:18:21,Twokinds,I mean April
31-03-2018T14:18:46,Bgrmystr2,hey Were
31-03-2018T14:19:25,Bgrmystr2,I'm sure the community won't mind if delay today's stream or whatever
31-03-2018T14:19:46,Bgrmystr2,"doesn't bother me any, it is Easter after all"
31-03-2018T14:19:58,ThingsAreMoving,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
31-03-2018T14:20:19,Twokinds,I'm also sad I never got to draw Nibbly as a bunny
31-03-2018T14:20:30,Twokinds,The whole thing just snuck up on me
31-03-2018T14:20:55,NeonMitsumi,Don't worry Tom. Go spend time with the family! ^-^
31-03-2018T14:21:07,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. it only happens every single year.. :P
31-03-2018T14:21:32,ThingsAreMoving,unless your family is playing a prank. y'know april fools and all
31-03-2018T14:21:40,Bgrmystr2,lool
31-03-2018T14:22:39,Twokinds,"Hm. The dinner's at 6, I could probably be back by 8 and do some sketches then."
31-03-2018T14:23:32,Bgrmystr2,would you be able to do the whole stream starting then? Or would you need to do the other half on monday? :o
31-03-2018T14:23:53,Twokinds,"No, I won't be able to do the whole thing, but I should be able to do a few at least."
31-03-2018T14:24:07,Twokinds,"I've got a lot of Nora Cards to post anyway, so it should be fine."
31-03-2018T14:25:03,NeonMitsumi,No rush. Family is the priority at the end.
31-03-2018T14:27:40,ThingsAreMoving,"See ya in five-six hours, then, yes?"
31-03-2018T14:29:23,Twokinds,There
31-03-2018T14:29:32,Twokinds,New offline thing for people who come in
31-03-2018T14:29:52,ThingsAreMoving,noice.
31-03-2018T14:29:54,ThingsAreMoving,have fun!
31-03-2018T14:30:10,Bgrmystr2,ayy nice
31-03-2018T14:30:27,Bgrmystr2,you know it's still EDT right xD
31-03-2018T14:30:43,Bgrmystr2,or are we just ignoring that it exists? :thinking:
31-03-2018T14:30:46,Bgrmystr2,we can do that too
31-03-2018T14:30:58,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, I'm flexible"
31-03-2018T14:31:11,NeonMitsumi,"See ya, Tom! :cneonmitsumi-engarde: :cneonmitsumi-somberto:"
31-03-2018T14:31:52,Twokinds,"Does the name really change too? Ugh I'm just gunna keep calling it est pff timezones, whatever"
31-03-2018T14:32:07,Twokinds,Tis a silly system anyway
31-03-2018T14:32:15,Bgrmystr2,yeah it does
31-03-2018T14:32:22,Bgrmystr2,xD
31-03-2018T14:32:44,Bgrmystr2,"a silly system that  prevents tens of thousands of vehicle accidents over the year, yeah"
31-03-2018T14:32:48,Bgrmystr2,among other things
31-03-2018T14:35:00,Combak,"Tom, you sure the dinner isn't an April's Fools Day prank?"
31-03-2018T14:35:11,Bgrmystr2,xD
31-03-2018T14:35:23,Twokinds,I hope not!
31-03-2018T14:40:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Everybody o/
31-03-2018T14:45:38,TorqueEmUp,Honestly I don't believe that at all bgr. especially on mornings where people lose an hour of sleep.
31-03-2018T14:45:58,TorqueEmUp,:P
31-03-2018T14:46:36,TorqueEmUp,Seriously why can't there just be a universal time for everyone? would make things so much more simple.
31-03-2018T14:46:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"Happy Easter, Tom! üêáüê£ Happy Easter chat!"
31-03-2018T14:47:03,TorqueEmUp,"But then you'd have to get EVERYONE to agree to it, which would be impossible."
31-03-2018T14:47:42,Bgrmystr2,"Torque. You don't have to believe it, it's statistics."
31-03-2018T14:47:54,TerraTheWizard,hellos chat peoples
31-03-2018T14:47:56,TerraTheWizard,boop
31-03-2018T14:48:03,Bgrmystr2,One single day of people losing one single hour is not going to stand up to the hundred days of that extra hour saved.
31-03-2018T14:48:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"A family dinner - that sounds nice. Here, we have a dinner at church, and sometimes again at home as a family"
31-03-2018T14:48:14,Bgrmystr2,"Sorry mate, but that math doesn't add up. :P"
31-03-2018T14:48:42,TorqueEmUp,"If people can't drive in the dark, they shouldn't be driving at all."
31-03-2018T14:49:00,TorqueEmUp,That's why cars have headlights
31-03-2018T14:49:30,Bgrmystr2,That's pretty irrelevant. A lot of vehicle accidents happen at night
31-03-2018T14:49:39,Bgrmystr2,"also, headlights don't prevent that."
31-03-2018T14:49:59,SpazztasticKiwi,See traffic hazard called ‚Äúdeer‚Äù
31-03-2018T14:50:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,just add more lights
31-03-2018T14:50:23,TorqueEmUp,Deer are going to be out when the sun is up as well
31-03-2018T14:50:33,TorqueEmUp,in the wee hours of the morning
31-03-2018T14:50:54,Vatruvius,Hello everyone! :ptv-greetings: Happy Easter!
31-03-2018T14:51:05,Vatruvius,Did I miss anything good?
31-03-2018T14:51:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,streams been delayed
31-03-2018T14:51:19,MarvTheHugPharaoh,so no not really
31-03-2018T14:51:28,TorqueEmUp,Need to cull the numbers somehow.
31-03-2018T14:51:35,Vatruvius,Agh...delayed how long?
31-03-2018T14:51:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom has a family dinner apparently üòÄ
31-03-2018T14:51:46,TorqueEmUp,Oh I guess it'd have helped if I actually looked at the stream image there
31-03-2018T14:51:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"4, 5 hours"
31-03-2018T14:52:05,Vatruvius,lol
31-03-2018T14:52:06,Bgrmystr2,"it says how long on the offline image, Vatru"
31-03-2018T14:52:08,Vatruvius,Yeah Torque
31-03-2018T14:52:11,BluePhantom90,or April 1st joke
31-03-2018T14:52:28,Bgrmystr2,Not likely
31-03-2018T14:52:36,TorqueEmUp,I'll stick around just in case. lol
31-03-2018T14:52:36,SpazztasticKiwi,4-5 hours and Tom‚Äôs not a social person
31-03-2018T14:52:47,TorqueEmUp,No but he is a family person
31-03-2018T14:52:48,BluePhantom90,besides with his Family
31-03-2018T14:52:52,Vatruvius,"That would have been yesterday...""Surprise Stream"" on his patreon."
31-03-2018T14:53:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"Whenever I go to a family dinner or gathering, it‚Äôs only nice for the first hour or so"
31-03-2018T14:53:37,TorqueEmUp,Indeed
31-03-2018T14:53:49,TorqueEmUp,I never cared for family gatherings
31-03-2018T14:53:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Then the ‚Äúwhere are you going to college‚Äù ‚Äúdo you have a special someone‚Äù questions start
31-03-2018T14:54:13,TorqueEmUp,Bleh
31-03-2018T14:54:23,TheFDdriver,hello
31-03-2018T14:54:51,Vatruvius,I know what you mean Kiwi...
31-03-2018T14:55:35,Vatruvius,You are asking about my life and then we will split ways until the next reunion in 3 years...
31-03-2018T14:55:45,Combak,"So, Tom has posted the Nora card he worked on..."
31-03-2018T14:55:56,TheFDdriver,yrs
31-03-2018T14:56:02,TheFDdriver,*yes*
31-03-2018T14:56:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"My thing is, if you talked to me on a regular basis or checked up on a regular basis, you‚Äôd know these things"
31-03-2018T14:56:05,Combak,But the two pictures under it are some wierd sort of file...
31-03-2018T14:56:17,Combak,Tries to download when I open the image in a new tab.
31-03-2018T14:56:37,TheFDdriver,hmm...
31-03-2018T14:58:16,TheFDdriver,it worked fine for me
31-03-2018T14:58:57,Bgrmystr2,"no, combak, that's not weird"
31-03-2018T14:59:03,Bgrmystr2,that's normal functionality for patreon
31-03-2018T14:59:10,Bgrmystr2,the primary image opens in your browser
31-03-2018T14:59:19,Bgrmystr2,the latter two save to your computer instead of opening directly
31-03-2018T14:59:26,Bgrmystr2,they're the same filetypes as anything else.
31-03-2018T14:59:50,Bgrmystr2,"That happens all the time. Every time tom has a second image on a patreon post, it happens."
31-03-2018T15:01:21,Combak,Wierd...
31-03-2018T15:01:32,Bgrmystr2,"like i said, not weird at all. xD"
31-03-2018T15:02:35,Vatruvius,I actually cannot open these other pictures Bgr...my computer is treating the images as extensions.
31-03-2018T15:02:41,Bgrmystr2,patreon doesn't have the primary image attachment and the secondary image attachments uploaded the same way
31-03-2018T15:03:03,thestooge,Evening everyone!
31-03-2018T15:04:00,Combak,Hi Stooge!
31-03-2018T15:04:00,TheFDdriver,im off to the church to join my mom
31-03-2018T15:04:07,Combak,Bye then FD!
31-03-2018T15:04:24,TheFDdriver,i will be back though
31-03-2018T15:05:05,Bgrmystr2,"Ahh, Vatru I see what happened for you lol"
31-03-2018T15:05:11,Bgrmystr2,the filetype didn't save
31-03-2018T15:05:56,Vatruvius,*sigh*
31-03-2018T15:07:23,Bgrmystr2,lol dude just rename the file and put .png at the end of it
31-03-2018T15:07:32,Vatruvius,Already did that.
31-03-2018T15:07:36,Vatruvius,All good now.
31-03-2018T15:07:38,Bgrmystr2,then problem solved :)
31-03-2018T15:08:06,Bgrmystr2,likely a bug
31-03-2018T15:08:27,Bgrmystr2,"the image obviously uploaded as a png, or it wouldn't have had the preview in the patreon post."
31-03-2018T15:08:57,Vatruvius,Might just be that I deleted the file extension when I renamed it.
31-03-2018T15:09:23,Bgrmystr2,Probably not how it worked
31-03-2018T15:09:36,Bgrmystr2,"they were just ""file"" types with no actual extension on it."
31-03-2018T15:10:06,Vatruvius,Maybe just how googled handled it? Not sure...it is good now so.
31-03-2018T15:10:19,Bgrmystr2,"so the computer sees the file as some kind of extention, but doesn't know what kind cuz it's not labeled with an extention at the end"
31-03-2018T15:10:27,Bgrmystr2,it's likely a bug on patreon's end.
31-03-2018T15:10:32,Bgrmystr2,has nothing to do with google
31-03-2018T15:15:01,Vatruvius,"I will take your word for it...I do not know anything about web design and links, etc. That is coming up in class at the end of the semester."
31-03-2018T15:16:23,Bgrmystr2,It can't possibly be google if I got the same thing and nothing I have uses google
31-03-2018T15:17:14,Bgrmystr2,"pc w/ firefox, not chrome. so it's definitely patreon in some degree."
31-03-2018T15:23:29,Vatruvius,Hmm...interesting.
31-03-2018T15:44:01,ThingsAreMoving,that nora redraw is... hot
31-03-2018T15:45:44,Vatruvius,Reconsidering your fantasies Things?
31-03-2018T15:47:17,ThingsAreMoving,"honestly, I'm more of a scaly than a furry"
31-03-2018T15:47:29,CrimsonHelsing,"Crap, darn Picarto on my phone isn't working right."
31-03-2018T15:48:04,CrimsonHelsing,The user list still has the chat in the background jumbled together with the usernames
31-03-2018T15:48:19,CrimsonHelsing,Even icons aren't loading
31-03-2018T15:50:30,Bgrmystr2,rip
31-03-2018T15:50:37,Bgrmystr2,sounds like your phone is borked
31-03-2018T15:50:43,Bgrmystr2,restart the app perhaps
31-03-2018T15:50:54,Vatruvius,Same happens to my Picarto app.
31-03-2018T16:01:55,Bigboi182,Hey!
31-03-2018T16:02:07,Bigboi182,"No jokes here, right?"
31-03-2018T16:03:16,ThingsAreMoving,Left.

31-03-2018T16:03:52,Bigboi182,That was actually good...
31-03-2018T16:03:58,Bigboi182,I'll give you that.
31-03-2018T16:04:07,Bigboi182,"Well, stream's delayed."
31-03-2018T16:04:16,Bigboi182,"Good, I guess..."
31-03-2018T16:04:27,Bigboi182,I have to pack tonight.
31-03-2018T16:04:41,Bigboi182,Not sure I'm gonna make it...
31-03-2018T16:43:16,CrimsonHelsing,@Bigboi182 what's going on?
31-03-2018T16:45:21,Vatruvius,:ptv-sleepy:
31-03-2018T17:37:40,Angelicara,:ptv-sleepy:
31-03-2018T18:10:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Wonder if it‚Äôll be 4 or 5 hours before the stream
31-03-2018T18:14:17,Vatruvius,Yeah...really...:ptv-sleepy:...I think it may be true...and not...:ptv-sleepy:...a prank...:ptv-sleepy:
31-03-2018T18:17:15,unsteddyphoenix,That'd be a messed up prank lol.
31-03-2018T18:17:40,Vatruvius,:ptv-hearts: I don't think it is a prank. I am going to have an Easter dinner with my family as well.
31-03-2018T18:18:20,unsteddyphoenix,"I woke up, saw the notice, went back to sleep. Feelin' good. :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:"
31-03-2018T18:18:32,Vatruvius,lol
31-03-2018T18:20:18,Bgrmystr2,"lol, nice phoenix"
31-03-2018T18:20:44,Bgrmystr2,Should everyone be as capable of seeing the notice as you are..
31-03-2018T18:20:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"I had the impression that their mother, Mark, and his step family was his only family in the U.S."
31-03-2018T18:20:50,Bgrmystr2,it'd be so much easier.
31-03-2018T18:21:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"Likely who he‚Äôll be with, minus Mark"
31-03-2018T18:22:10,Vatruvius,Who is to say Mark is not attending?
31-03-2018T18:24:48,PalmettoPathfinder1,Happy Easter everyone!
31-03-2018T18:24:59,Bgrmystr2,Happy Easter :v
31-03-2018T18:25:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Happy Easter
31-03-2018T18:25:34,Vatruvius,Happy Easter
31-03-2018T18:25:50,FoxxTrotter,:rabbit::fox::rabbit:
31-03-2018T18:26:35,Vatruvius,Umm...I do not think that configuration of animals is good on Easter.
31-03-2018T18:26:51,Bgrmystr2,good enough lol
31-03-2018T18:26:57,FoxxTrotter,That's your opinion... :cfoxxtrotter-SlyRazz:
31-03-2018T18:27:28,PalmettoPathfinder1,So I requested a new idea: Natani as Ara Haan from Elsword:  https://elwiki.net/wiki/images/3/3a/Portrait_-_Shakti_Celestial_Fox_Mode.png
31-03-2018T18:28:12,unsteddyphoenix,Isnt that a fox
31-03-2018T18:28:37,Bgrmystr2,why not mike lol :P
31-03-2018T18:28:38,Vatruvius,If it is a fox then it should be femMike
31-03-2018T18:28:46,FoxxTrotter,"Foxy, indeed."
31-03-2018T18:29:15,PalmettoPathfinder1,About the only crossover that I think people might know.  And yes that is true.  And dang.   I should have picked either Laura or FemMike
31-03-2018T18:30:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark is in California
31-03-2018T18:30:22,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs why
31-03-2018T18:30:32,Vatruvius,How dare he... :P
31-03-2018T18:31:10,qwe304,@PalmettoPathfinder1  you can probably still change it
31-03-2018T18:31:29,Vatruvius,If your idea is not voted Palmetto then you can change it for the next sketch stream.
31-03-2018T18:31:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I could see him Skyping in during the reunion
31-03-2018T18:31:46,Vatruvius,I have no idea if Tom already entered in the suggestions or not. He might have.
31-03-2018T18:32:04,Vatruvius,lol...Kiwi. Mark on a TV at the dining table
31-03-2018T18:32:22,PalmettoPathfinder1,That's true @Vatruvius.  Oh well.  That's okay.  Besides it was either that or Natani as a dragon knight http://wiki.dfo-world.com/images/e/ec/Dragon_Knight_Art.jpg
31-03-2018T18:33:03,PalmettoPathfinder1,Although now that i think about it Natani with dragon horns and wings might be weird.
31-03-2018T18:33:15,Vatruvius,humanReni?
31-03-2018T18:33:29,Bgrmystr2,"that's a spoiler, Vatru :u"
31-03-2018T18:34:02,Vatruvius,How?
31-03-2018T18:34:13,PalmettoPathfinder1,I don't know.  That's a good question.
31-03-2018T18:34:20,Bgrmystr2,because Tom said so
31-03-2018T18:34:38,Bgrmystr2,Probably something later in the story
31-03-2018T18:34:39,PalmettoPathfinder1,Boy requesting crossovers isn't easy
31-03-2018T18:35:07,Vatruvius,Hmm...well...humanNora then?
31-03-2018T18:35:45,PalmettoPathfinder1,But wouldn't Nora or Reni be the baby dragon?  Oh dang now I want to see what Nora was as a baby dragon!
31-03-2018T18:36:19,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: Tom's shown partially human Nora before, but I don't know if he'll go full-human transformation"
31-03-2018T18:36:23,PalmettoPathfinder1,Then there was this picture http://wiki.dfo-world.com/images/d/d4/DreadnoughtPortrait.jpg
31-03-2018T18:36:49,PalmettoPathfinder1,Anime games provide the best crossover outfits.
31-03-2018T18:36:55,PalmettoPathfinder1,:)
31-03-2018T18:37:53,Bgrmystr2,Crossovers are not very popular
31-03-2018T18:37:55,Vatruvius,I was looking for that color/sketch where little dragon Nora was accusing Nibbly...but I found this instead. https://twokinds.deviantart.com/art/Nora-the-Dragongirl-29258178
31-03-2018T18:39:05,Bgrmystr2,lol ignoring the one with Flora
31-03-2018T18:39:38,Bgrmystr2,https://www.patreon.com/posts/norage-trois-17616549
31-03-2018T18:39:50,Vatruvius,I have to agree Bgr...there are not many cross overs.
31-03-2018T18:40:26,Bgrmystr2,it happens
31-03-2018T18:40:29,Vatruvius,Yeah...that is a humanNora but there other certainly has more skin and less scales.
31-03-2018T18:40:39,Vatruvius,the*
31-03-2018T18:41:00,Bgrmystr2,that's probably as close as you'll get
31-03-2018T18:41:04,Bgrmystr2,considering the other is so old
31-03-2018T18:41:15,Vatruvius,Yup
31-03-2018T18:43:17,Bgrmystr2,ahaha
31-03-2018T18:43:23,Bgrmystr2,you mentioned my name and he bolted
31-03-2018T18:43:45,Vatruvius,lol
31-03-2018T18:44:24,Bgrmystr2,wonder if he actually just disconnected or somethin :thinking:
31-03-2018T18:44:44,Vatruvius,I do not know.
31-03-2018T18:47:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"This is likely a stupid question, but a $10 sketch request is a one time thing, right - like the subscription, you have to renew or repurchase it?"
31-03-2018T18:47:18,MarvTheHugPharaoh,$10 every month
31-03-2018T18:47:37,CrRAR,"Yeah you can quit it, no multimonth commitment."
31-03-2018T18:47:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"So it auto renews each month, and you stop it when/if you want?"
31-03-2018T18:48:05,CrRAR,yup
31-03-2018T18:48:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Ah.
31-03-2018T18:48:35,Vatruvius,You get what...4 sketch ideas a month.
31-03-2018T18:48:42,CrRAR,"First time is like up-front, then 1st of the month thereafter."
31-03-2018T18:48:44,CrRAR,yeah
31-03-2018T18:48:57,SpazztasticKiwi,"Ok, so another question: can you make your name anonymous or provide any name instead of the name on your profile?"
31-03-2018T18:49:10,Vatruvius,YEs
31-03-2018T18:49:23,SpazztasticKiwi,üòÅ

31-03-2018T18:49:36,CrRAR,Yeah your patreon username can be anything.
31-03-2018T18:49:47,Vatruvius,The submission is anonymous and all submissions you submit the name who suggested it.
31-03-2018T18:49:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I have an idea for when I return home from vacation
31-03-2018T18:50:59,Vatruvius,What is that...
31-03-2018T18:51:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Not tellin
31-03-2018T18:51:16,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs kinda a surprise
31-03-2018T18:51:20,Vatruvius,Come on...you know you want to
31-03-2018T18:52:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"But are you saying that the submission is automatically anonymous unless you provide a name, whether it be your Patreon profile name, Patreon nickname, or a made up name?"
31-03-2018T18:52:43,Vatruvius,Yes...how do you think some of the names are rather convenient for the sketch?
31-03-2018T18:52:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Got it
31-03-2018T18:53:21,Vatruvius,Like this one https://www.patreon.com/posts/alaric-leaps-17845948

31-03-2018T18:54:17,unsteddyphoenix,Kind of a running joke
31-03-2018T18:54:18,Vatruvius,Did he?
31-03-2018T18:54:21,CrRAR,On the suggestion form you are asked to verify your patreon username.
31-03-2018T18:54:28,unsteddyphoenix,But yeah you can put any name you want
31-03-2018T18:54:32,MarvTheHugPharaoh,He names them all
31-03-2018T18:54:37,Vatruvius,You literally have to submit a name along with the suggestion.
31-03-2018T18:54:40,Vatruvius,kiwi
31-03-2018T18:54:49,unsteddyphoenix,"But you can put ""anonymas"" so"

31-03-2018T18:58:49,Bgrmystr2,"of course combak, look at the offline image"
31-03-2018T18:58:54,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs only two minutes till the 4 hour mark. Chill
31-03-2018T18:59:08,NeonMitsumi,"He actually never left, he picked 7 sketches by himself and made them off stream."
31-03-2018T18:59:10,Bgrmystr2,he'll be back within the next hour lol
31-03-2018T18:59:26,unsteddyphoenix,"Start stream, show quickly all the sketches, end stream"
31-03-2018T18:59:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Or maybe he‚Äôs been here all along
31-03-2018T18:59:42,NeonMitsumi,"To be fair, they would probably be more quality picks."
31-03-2018T18:59:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,^
31-03-2018T19:01:11,ThingsAreMoving,Imagine if we had 'Tom's pick' option in every poll
31-03-2018T19:01:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'd vote for it every time
31-03-2018T19:01:26,Vatruvius,That would be a good option.
31-03-2018T19:02:07,NeonMitsumi,*Tom scribbles Tom's pickaxe on the stream*
31-03-2018T19:02:10,ThingsAreMoving,Sometimes I don't see any interesting suggestions (for me at least) so I'd welcome that option
31-03-2018T19:02:36,BadFoMo,@ThingsAreMoving Same.
31-03-2018T19:02:42,SpazztasticKiwi,"Sketch idea: I legitimately don‚Äôt care. Draw a stick, idk."
31-03-2018T19:02:50,SpazztasticKiwi,And he draws a stick
31-03-2018T19:02:51,NeonMitsumi,Tom'd be happy.
31-03-2018T19:02:57,ThingsAreMoving,"lol, value suggestion"

31-03-2018T19:03:53,Vatruvius,That would make me cry.
31-03-2018T19:04:00,MrEase,"Suggestion, whatever crazy thing tom wants to draw"
31-03-2018T19:04:29,Vatruvius,"No, even better...draw this sketch idea with your other hand! :D"
31-03-2018T19:04:39,InTheLionsDen,For this weekend all the suggestions should have involved six or more characters. Tom would scream.
31-03-2018T19:04:43,ThingsAreMoving,We all know Tom draws with his mind
31-03-2018T19:04:45,NeonMitsumi,The winner is actually the one on the bottom of the list.

31-03-2018T19:05:33,SpazztasticKiwi,He‚Äôd probably draw that electric blanket though instead
31-03-2018T19:05:39,Vatruvius,Draw your favorite character...none of them are from TK
31-03-2018T19:06:58,ThingsAreMoving,Well tom drew that Lamenting abomination from D:OS 2 and it was pretty... neat

31-03-2018T19:53:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,if he oversleeps it just means we can go to bed early

31-03-2018T20:06:28,TorqueEmUp,Nice
31-03-2018T20:06:30,ThingsAreMoving,lol
31-03-2018T20:06:49,PalmettoPathfinder1,I wonder what would happen if we gave Natani catnip?  Also I'm assuming Tom's cat didn't like that.
31-03-2018T20:06:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Catto needed a bath then

31-03-2018T20:09:20,BadFoMo,Yep.
31-03-2018T20:09:20,PalmettoPathfinder1,Kitty has fangs. And I agree with Kiwi
31-03-2018T20:09:46,TorqueEmUp,Claws are not vital unless they are outdoor cats
31-03-2018T20:09:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Declawing a cat means they remove the cat‚Äôs entire first knuckle
31-03-2018T20:09:59,WIPKING,When is strwam?

31-03-2018T20:22:03,Vatruvius,But so are dog claws so...I just do not like cats as much because most of them in my experience are quite nasty when things do not go their way.
31-03-2018T20:22:15,SpazztasticKiwi,And psychology problematic for the cat
31-03-2018T20:22:25,TheBeckoner,Belive it or not if you treat a cat right it wont wanna scratch you anyway. But of course it will happen at some point.
31-03-2018T20:22:40,ThingsAreMoving,Alright. I'm gonna take a nap with sound on. If there's a stream tonight and If I wake up then I'll be back. If not then see ya next week
31-03-2018T20:22:40,BadFoMo,"So, should we change the topic from Cosmetic Pet Mutilation to Cosmetic Human Mutation?"

31-03-2018T20:23:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Human mutation? Like what?

31-03-2018T20:24:08,Vatruvius,Plastic surgery is more like self-mutilation.
31-03-2018T20:24:22,BadFoMo,Like having your DNA chanced a little os you can grow a tail.
31-03-2018T20:24:26,BluePhantom90,e-e I would be piss if I leave and the stream starts

31-03-2018T20:24:48,PalmettoPathfinder1,So I get the feeling that Tom might sleep through his stream
31-03-2018T20:24:53,PalmettoPathfinder1,His own stream
31-03-2018T20:24:59,Combak,I have returned!

31-03-2018T20:27:15,CrRAR,Should just change the stream offline picture slowly to include more and more inexplicable easter eggs
31-03-2018T20:27:20,TorqueEmUp,I guess speedlimits are pointless as long as I drive carefully.
31-03-2018T20:27:22,unsteddyphoenix,"I mean, napping sucks"
31-03-2018T20:27:26,unsteddyphoenix,Lol agreed cr
31-03-2018T20:27:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Still think he‚Äôs stalking chat
31-03-2018T20:27:48,Vatruvius,It is unnecessary Kiwi...my parents agree after the fact. The only reason why the doctors did it besides the money was that they said it would be difficult to keep clean.
31-03-2018T20:27:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Torque, laws are just suggestions"
31-03-2018T20:28:06,TheBeckoner,^
31-03-2018T20:28:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,like red lights
31-03-2018T20:28:14,PalmettoPathfinder1,Now do you mean actual Easter eggs or are you using the definition of hidden background refs Easter eggs?
31-03-2018T20:28:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve heard the ‚Äúbut it can cause infections‚Äù excuse made before
31-03-2018T20:28:21,TheBeckoner,"""40 over isnt THAT bad..."""
31-03-2018T20:28:26,CrRAR,"uhh, ""yes"""
31-03-2018T20:28:34,CrRAR,Palm XD
31-03-2018T20:28:41,Vatruvius,Yes Kiwi...it is just stupid. How on Earth did we survive this long without doing this?
31-03-2018T20:28:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"you should stop, but nothing is making you, other then on coming traffic"
31-03-2018T20:28:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Magic
31-03-2018T20:29:02,TheBeckoner,Ultimate game of chicken
31-03-2018T20:29:05,TheBeckoner,Marv
31-03-2018T20:29:06,PalmettoPathfinder1,Well you didn't specify @CrRAR
31-03-2018T20:29:15,CrRAR,i kno ikno
31-03-2018T20:29:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"oof, I love my car too much for chicken"
31-03-2018T20:29:32,TheBeckoner,Thats what $500 beaters are for
31-03-2018T20:29:35,CrRAR,I'm just imagining random painted eggs appearing
31-03-2018T20:29:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Though the infection risk is irrelevant if you factor in bathing regularly
31-03-2018T20:29:39,Vatruvius,"Magic has allowed humanity to survive until we became aware of micro organisms at which point it said ""Good luck...I am out of here!"""
31-03-2018T20:29:45,BluePhantom90,well brb guys. heading back to my place
31-03-2018T20:29:50,CrRAR,see ya blue
31-03-2018T20:29:53,TheBeckoner,Bye Blue
31-03-2018T20:30:06,BadFoMo,Bye.
31-03-2018T20:30:13,Glavous,bye blue
31-03-2018T20:30:27,PalmettoPathfinder1,I'm imagining a white cute bunny dancing with Snoopy while hiding Easter Eggs all over the world.
31-03-2018T20:30:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Then there‚Äôs the religious aspect people throw at you. Or the ‚Äúbut he‚Äôll look different that all the other boys‚Äù
31-03-2018T20:30:38,Vatruvius,lol
31-03-2018T20:31:04,Vatruvius,I certainly felt different then all the other boys. I was the odd one out.
31-03-2018T20:31:10,SpazztasticKiwi,*than
31-03-2018T20:31:28,TheBeckoner,Talking about circumcision?
31-03-2018T20:31:28,HeresyArtStream,Still no Sunday stream eh?
31-03-2018T20:31:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"True, but you can ask to have it done later in life nowadays if you want, right?"
31-03-2018T20:31:36,Bigboi182,Not yet....
31-03-2018T20:31:39,BadFoMo,Nope.
31-03-2018T20:31:39,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Toms napping heresy
31-03-2018T20:31:40,TheBeckoner,Seems Not
31-03-2018T20:31:44,Bigboi182,Tom's napping...
31-03-2018T20:31:45,Vatruvius,To be honest...you lose some vital protection. I say this with experience.
31-03-2018T20:31:59,Bigboi182,Let's hope he set his alarm...
31-03-2018T20:32:03,Vatruvius,I am not sure Kiwi.
31-03-2018T20:32:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Me and Vat are talking about human cosmetic mutilation (circumcision)
31-03-2018T20:32:32,SpazztasticKiwi,So yes
31-03-2018T20:32:35,TheBeckoner,ah ok
31-03-2018T20:32:45,Vatruvius,I like how Kiwi and I are having the side conversation amidst the ramblings of the chat.
31-03-2018T20:32:50,TheBeckoner,I dont feel like Im missing anything hah
31-03-2018T20:32:52,PalmettoPathfinder1,Let him sleep.  And if we are on topic of mutilation what about cybernetics?
31-03-2018T20:32:59,Bigboi182,You didn't have to make it so specific kiwi...
31-03-2018T20:33:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,whisper is a thing
31-03-2018T20:33:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I didn‚Äôt bring it up
31-03-2018T20:33:18,Bigboi182,i know...
31-03-2018T20:33:18,Vatruvius,Screw whispering...I want everyone to know!
31-03-2018T20:33:24,Bigboi182,Yeah!
31-03-2018T20:33:37,Vatruvius,I think you did Kiwi...I know I joined the subject.
31-03-2018T20:33:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Someone else mentioned it as human mutilation. I‚Äôd mentioned plastic surgery
31-03-2018T20:33:42,Bigboi182,Also I just noticed that sage is here...
31-03-2018T20:33:54,Bigboi182,Ok then Kiwi.
31-03-2018T20:34:00,PalmettoPathfinder1,So I noticed some similarities between TwoKinds and Earthsea
31-03-2018T20:34:01,Bigboi182,That makes sense...
31-03-2018T20:34:09,TorqueEmUp,"He said 9ish, technically it's 9 for another 25 minutes."
31-03-2018T20:34:22,Bigboi182,A lot of similarities?
31-03-2018T20:35:01,TorqueEmUp,Guess I will play some Far Cry 5
31-03-2018T20:35:08,Bigboi182,maybe...
31-03-2018T20:35:32,Bigboi182,I came from playing project cars 2 to watch the stream...
31-03-2018T20:35:49,Bigboi182,And now i think i'll miss it if igo back...
31-03-2018T20:35:56,Bigboi182,*I go
31-03-2018T20:36:06,PalmettoPathfinder1,I said some not a lot.  I mean one similarity is that dragons are neither good nor evil but are very powerful and see humans as short lived mayflies.  They are weak against wizards and other dragons.  In Earthsea but this might be true in TwoKinds as well
31-03-2018T20:36:19,WIPKING,When the servers reset does it unignore people so i am still heard
31-03-2018T20:36:40,WIPKING,Cause im sorry i was anoying
31-03-2018T20:36:45,Angelicara,I would like to know can i go to sleep or not....
31-03-2018T20:36:49,Bigboi182,Are you sure?
31-03-2018T20:36:55,Bgrmystr2,Don't think so WIP
31-03-2018T20:36:59,Bgrmystr2,it keeps anyone you've blocked
31-03-2018T20:37:05,PalmettoPathfinder1,Also it's not a good idea to try to cheat death in either setting as it drives people mad or evil or both which is true in both settings.
31-03-2018T20:37:06,Bgrmystr2,and anyone banned from streams
31-03-2018T20:37:25,TheFDdriver,hello

31-03-2018T20:38:27,Bgrmystr2,so it's irrelevant

31-03-2018T20:40:19,Bgrmystr2,I don't like blocking people. I can easily just not respond.
31-03-2018T20:40:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I just look away
31-03-2018T20:40:31,Bgrmystr2,Proceed to watch them desolve into madness.
31-03-2018T20:40:39,Bigboi182,"Me too, but some people get my blood boiling."
31-03-2018T20:40:39,Bgrmystr2,actually kind of entertaining
31-03-2018T20:40:45,Mippy,"@WIPKING you do know 12PM is noon tomorrow, right?"

31-03-2018T20:43:16,PalmettoPathfinder1,We need to specify more often y'all.

31-03-2018T20:43:25,Vatruvius,I am 20 years old and my parents want my sister and I to do an evening egg hunt.
31-03-2018T20:43:34,PalmettoPathfinder1,Especially in this day and age

31-03-2018T20:43:50,Bigboi182,That's pretty dangerous...
31-03-2018T20:43:51,SpazztasticKiwi,How old‚Äôs your sister?
31-03-2018T20:43:55,Vatruvius,18
31-03-2018T20:44:04,PalmettoPathfinder1,Because I don't have a reason to make bad specification jokes.
31-03-2018T20:44:10,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs weird
31-03-2018T20:44:12,Vatruvius,If she were still little then I would understand but no
31-03-2018T20:44:13,Bigboi182,"OK, now it doesn't makes sense Vat..."

31-03-2018T20:44:51,CrimsonHelsing,"Bigboi no offense, but you remind me of a former friend of mine. And that ""....""-ing is kinda bugging me, since he did that too. A lot."

31-03-2018T20:45:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"knowing from experience, a rabbit hole can hide you"
31-03-2018T20:45:51,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúMy friend just called. His car‚Äôs stuck somewhere and he needs me to help‚Äù
31-03-2018T20:45:51,Vatruvius,None of those thing will help...plus my parents know I am in the house.
31-03-2018T20:45:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Would that work?
31-03-2018T20:46:05,PalmettoPathfinder1,Now do you mean the closet as in the closet where you store clothes or do you mean closet as in the water closet they have in Europe?
31-03-2018T20:46:23,NeonMitsumi,wat

31-03-2018T21:01:31,TheFDdriver,well come back Tom

31-03-2018T21:10:51,TheFDdriver,its april fools
31-03-2018T21:10:55,MrEase,To be honest I'd really rather have a week of Tom doing his own thing
31-03-2018T21:10:56,Bigboi182,I would like that...
31-03-2018T21:11:00,WIPKING,For tues
31-03-2018T21:11:01,MrEase,rather than patreon votes
31-03-2018T21:11:01,SpazztasticKiwi,There may be. We‚Äôre waiting to see
31-03-2018T21:11:05,Vatruvius,Tom is picking the sketches...that should be pretty cool.
31-03-2018T21:11:15,CrimsonHelsing,Okay okay. This *once.*
31-03-2018T21:11:17,Bigboi182,He hasn't done that in 2 years or more.
31-03-2018T21:11:17,MrEase,just 7 sketches of his own volition would be cool
31-03-2018T21:11:20,WIPKING,Why does it have too be april fools
31-03-2018T21:11:23,Glavous,yeah that would be cool
31-03-2018T21:11:26,Mippy,"So...resubmit ideas for next week and enjoy ""Tom Pick Wek"" in the meen time"
31-03-2018T21:11:26,Vatruvius,It is not patreon votes for sketches...just colors.

31-03-2018T21:11:32,Bigboi182,And easter too.
31-03-2018T21:11:33,Bgrmystr2,I don't know what you're mad about Crimson. You have not lost anything you paid for as a patron.
31-03-2018T21:11:40,TheBeckoner,^
31-03-2018T21:11:47,ProsePro7,...why are there people on this stream?  I am so confused.
31-03-2018T21:11:53,TheFDdriver,wb Beck
31-03-2018T21:11:54,NeonMitsumi,"You're paying to support, not to have your name on a preggo sketch."
31-03-2018T21:11:55,Bgrmystr2,"As a patron, you pay for suggestions, and it doesn't make any difference if Tom picks it or the chat picks it."
31-03-2018T21:12:03,CrimsonHelsing,I said I'll go with it
31-03-2018T21:12:07,TheBeckoner,Thx FD
31-03-2018T21:12:11,Bigboi182,"Yeah man, it's ONE week."
31-03-2018T21:12:14,InTheLionsDen,He is picking from the patreon suggestions so the patreon subscribers get their chance.
31-03-2018T21:12:20,Bigboi182,"I know, we just have to make sure."

31-03-2018T21:13:22,Bgrmystr2,if you read the chat.. :u
31-03-2018T21:13:24,TheBeckoner,Honestly streams don't have to happen for anyhting else to happen. THey are for our benefit. Ultimately optional.
31-03-2018T21:13:28,MrEase,"Tom's not hosting polls, because its unfair to the EU voters who usually have a chance to vote, and its a little late"
31-03-2018T21:13:38,MrEase,he's just doing double tom picks
31-03-2018T21:13:53,MrEase,and stream is pending

31-03-2018T21:14:03,Bgrmystr2,"I'm.. not quite sure that's the reason, Ease lol"
31-03-2018T21:14:15,MrEase,"Its not the reason, but it could contribute to it"

31-03-2018T21:14:37,Bgrmystr2,stating it as the primary reason is disinformation :v

31-03-2018T21:21:22,BluePhantom90,Hey Tom may I ask a question about that one old question you asked about Lower quality comics for more pages? I just wanted to get a better idea what you mean by that
31-03-2018T21:21:22,WIPKING,That it
31-03-2018T21:21:30,Vatruvius,Now we are starting the Easter Dinner/egg hunt. This is going to be a long night.
31-03-2018T21:21:37,WIPKING,Lol
31-03-2018T21:21:51,Vatruvius,See you guys on the other side.
31-03-2018T21:21:58,WIPKING,Bye
31-03-2018T21:22:15,TheFDdriver,brb
31-03-2018T21:22:20,WIPKING,Brb
31-03-2018T21:22:44,BadFoMo,@BluePhantom90 When was this?
31-03-2018T21:22:57,BluePhantom90,a few weeks ago I think.
31-03-2018T21:23:23,BluePhantom90,I PM me on Discord and I can show you the question.
31-03-2018T21:23:43,TheBeckoner,I think that was laced with sarcasm. But I could be wrong
31-03-2018T21:23:56,Mippy,"@BluePhantom90 I remember that stream. All I could think was ""what's the catch?"""
31-03-2018T21:23:56,BluePhantom90,But When you mean lower quality Tom you mean like less detailed backgrounds?
31-03-2018T21:24:24,BadFoMo,@BluePhantom90 I don't have that. Sorry.
31-03-2018T21:24:28,BluePhantom90,that is what I thought
31-03-2018T21:24:32,BluePhantom90,huh old on
31-03-2018T21:26:04,BluePhantom90,oh well nvm. I just copied the answer I posted about Tom doing sketch drawings as a side comic of the story around the main characters
31-03-2018T21:27:25,Mippy,and I just sighned up fo a news letter from a cat I fallow on facebook
31-03-2018T21:28:58,Bigboi182,"Yeah, I'm outta here. See ya'll soon!"
31-03-2018T21:29:05,TheBeckoner,See yah Big
31-03-2018T21:29:08,TheFDdriver,im back
31-03-2018T21:29:09,Glavous,so the streams not happening?
31-03-2018T21:29:16,TorqueEmUp,Nope
31-03-2018T21:29:16,TheFDdriver,Bye Big
31-03-2018T21:29:20,TheFDdriver,no
31-03-2018T21:30:13,TorqueEmUp,And quite frankly I am getting rather annoyed by this constant last minute change in plans.
31-03-2018T21:30:44,TheFDdriver,"im going with my faggot of my Brother. See y""all"
31-03-2018T21:30:56,TheBeckoner,lol Bye FD
31-03-2018T21:31:13,TorqueEmUp,these*
31-03-2018T21:32:06,Glavous,huh well thats to bad.
31-03-2018T21:32:47,WIPKING,Me too torgue
31-03-2018T21:32:50,Glavous,I was kinda hopeing on watching a stream tonight
31-03-2018T21:33:00,WIPKING,Me too
31-03-2018T21:33:24,Bgrmystr2,"@BluePhantom90 He meant that there won't be as much detail. It has nothing to do with backgrounds, not really.. just that.. there may not be as much detail in the backgrounds or the character designs, it'd be more of a rushed page just to get it out"
31-03-2018T21:33:38,Bgrmystr2,rather than giving it the detail and giving it the look of a completed page.
31-03-2018T21:33:44,WIPKING,Im fine with that
31-03-2018T21:33:50,TorqueEmUp,"If you are not going to stream, DON'T, and don't fucking tell me a 2 hour window when you will be back, just to come back and hour after that and say. ""No stream."""
31-03-2018T21:34:04,WIPKING,I agree
31-03-2018T21:34:08,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, I'd rather the detail in the page."
31-03-2018T21:34:19,WIPKING,O dont
31-03-2018T21:34:25,WIPKING,Even start
31-03-2018T21:34:30,TorqueEmUp,"If there is any chance you aren't going to stream, don't fucking lead us on. Just don't stream."
31-03-2018T21:34:32,Glavous,me too Bgrmystr2
31-03-2018T21:35:01,TheBeckoner,Yeah I like the detail.
31-03-2018T21:35:08,Bgrmystr2,"Torque, you need to calm down, bro. It's not like he planned for this."
31-03-2018T21:35:10,TheBeckoner,like the grass
31-03-2018T21:35:17,WIPKING,Make a time too stream then do it imstead of changing it
31-03-2018T21:35:21,TorqueEmUp,"Like ""Hey it's Easter, no Steam"" fair enough"
31-03-2018T21:35:36,WIPKING,Fair
31-03-2018T21:35:45,unsteddyphoenix,"Would you prefer he said ""no stream"" and streamed?"
31-03-2018T21:35:46,TheBeckoner,Draw your own conclusion. That's what happened.
31-03-2018T21:36:06,Bgrmystr2,"He didn't even know there was a gettogether until around an hour or so before the stream was going to start, Torque."
31-03-2018T21:36:14,unsteddyphoenix,Or just streamed less overall 'cause some of the might not happen?
31-03-2018T21:36:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôm just gonna sit here and wait to see what the plan is
31-03-2018T21:36:32,Twokinds,I apologize
31-03-2018T21:36:39,Bgrmystr2,It isn't your fault tom :c
31-03-2018T21:36:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,no need to apologize
31-03-2018T21:36:49,Bgrmystr2,You do you. :)
31-03-2018T21:36:51,Twokinds,I didn't expect the sudden change of plans until I got the message this morning.
31-03-2018T21:36:54,SpazztasticKiwi,You had an improv time to see family
31-03-2018T21:37:00,BadFoMo,Plans just changed.
31-03-2018T21:37:02,SpazztasticKiwi,There‚Äôs nothing to apologize for
31-03-2018T21:37:05,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Its all good Tom, family first"
31-03-2018T21:37:13,Glavous,its not your fault tom
31-03-2018T21:37:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I wish I had more family still alive to spend time with
31-03-2018T21:37:17,TheBeckoner,Life takes priority over optional streams imo. All is good.
31-03-2018T21:37:18,BadFoMo,...and Ninja-ed.
31-03-2018T21:37:23,Mippy,Too many angry people in the chat today for my liking
31-03-2018T21:37:27,Twokinds,"I was intending to stream at the regular time up until I woke up. Just playing it by ear, didn't know if I would be or now."
31-03-2018T21:37:51,unsteddyphoenix,Exactly. He cant tell you anything if he himself doesnt know
31-03-2018T21:37:56,WIPKING,Sorry but its still sunday not mon.
31-03-2018T21:38:08,TorqueEmUp,Depends on where you like WIP
31-03-2018T21:38:12,TorqueEmUp,live*
31-03-2018T21:38:13,Bgrmystr2,"Not for everyone, WIP"
31-03-2018T21:38:20,WIPKING,And there was suposed to be a stream at 4 pm est
31-03-2018T21:38:22,Bgrmystr2,"Timezones exist, you know"
31-03-2018T21:38:25,WIPKING,Or 2 pm for me
31-03-2018T21:39:02,TorqueEmUp,I am more frustrated by having to wait two after after you told us to be here to get told it's not happening.
31-03-2018T21:39:17,BluePhantom90,Well I mean Tom I didn't have a problem but some people are glued to their computers to vote for the stream. I mean Tom I understand what happen. Some people would have liked a yay or nay on stream today.
31-03-2018T21:39:19,Mippy,It's like every one got rabbit turds instead of chocolate from teh Easter bunny or something
31-03-2018T21:39:23,TheBeckoner,Go do something else lol you arent bound to chat.
31-03-2018T21:39:26,TorqueEmUp,Shit happens I get that
31-03-2018T21:39:29,Bgrmystr2,"That's life, Torque."
31-03-2018T21:39:37,Vatruvius,I am just glad Tom streams at all. He could just do everything offline and just post his work. Thanks for trying Tom...I appreciate you tried to work in the stream on Easter with family and all.
31-03-2018T21:39:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"remember these streams are not for us, we're just along for the ride"
31-03-2018T21:40:02,TorqueEmUp,But when it start becoming commonplace it started getting rather frustrating.
31-03-2018T21:40:07,WIPKING,Fair but i got to go to bed bye
31-03-2018T21:40:08,TheBeckoner,They dont even have to happen.
31-03-2018T21:40:09,Twokinds,"I'm sorry, in the future I'll just say to wait for the post."
31-03-2018T21:40:13,Vatruvius,And my egg hunt was not that bad...got $62 out of it.
31-03-2018T21:40:18,WIPKING,No stream right
31-03-2018T21:40:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Cool üòé
31-03-2018T21:40:27,TheBeckoner,Nice Vat
31-03-2018T21:40:33,Twokinds,"I make an announcement on the Patreon, and you can follow the Picarto to get notified when a stream starts."
31-03-2018T21:40:34,WIPKING,Right
31-03-2018T21:40:40,WIPKING,Ok
31-03-2018T21:40:50,CrimsonHelsing,Okay
31-03-2018T21:41:01,Glavous,sounds good
31-03-2018T21:41:08,Bgrmystr2,:u
31-03-2018T21:41:14,TheBeckoner,The Chrome extension is much faster. Would recommend.
31-03-2018T21:41:26,Glavous,?
31-03-2018T21:41:27,BluePhantom90,yeah That would be best Tom. It was a new issue that happen and well a problem that can be fixed in the future
31-03-2018T21:41:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Patients is one of my simple strongsuits
31-03-2018T21:41:37,Mippy,@Twokinds I'm not mad Tom. I had nothing else to do today anyway. XD
31-03-2018T21:41:37,Vatruvius,Well have a good rest of your night Tom...I look forward to what sketches you chose to draw. He is still picking right?
31-03-2018T21:41:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Patience
31-03-2018T21:41:50,TheBeckoner,There is a notification plugin for Chrome. Bgr told me about it I think.
31-03-2018T21:41:54,Bgrmystr2,Yup

31-03-2018T21:43:11,TheBeckoner,You can always angrily hang up.
31-03-2018T21:43:17,TheBeckoner,Might Vat
31-03-2018T21:43:17,Bgrmystr2,Get run over by a tank and it'd still work.
31-03-2018T21:43:21,TheBeckoner,N*
31-03-2018T21:43:25,Bgrmystr2,"Can't say the same w/ your smartphones, now can ya"
31-03-2018T21:43:38,unsteddyphoenix,depends on the phone
31-03-2018T21:43:45,TheBeckoner,My dad had so motorola radio phones like that.
31-03-2018T21:43:53,TheBeckoner,Tanks they were
31-03-2018T21:43:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve dropped my phone multiple times. Not a crack
31-03-2018T21:44:08,Bgrmystr2,"yeh a few smartphones are rugged, but most are not"
31-03-2018T21:44:20,Bgrmystr2,and wouldn't actually support that level of weight without breaking
31-03-2018T21:44:21,TheBeckoner,My Droid turbo is pretty beefy. Shatter proof glass. been tested a couple times
31-03-2018T21:44:46,TheBeckoner,Droid Turbo 2*
31-03-2018T21:45:05,TheBeckoner,1 didn't have the shatter proof glass idt
31-03-2018T21:45:05,unsteddyphoenix,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6c8-r2yuJs
31-03-2018T21:46:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,all I saw was that phone can go underwater and now I want 7
31-03-2018T21:46:16,Bgrmystr2,hahahahaha the reveal phoenix
31-03-2018T21:46:19,Bgrmystr2,that's great
31-03-2018T21:46:45,TheBeckoner,Dang that thing is beef
31-03-2018T21:47:48,Bgrmystr2,"my phone can go underwater too, so nothin new to me"
31-03-2018T21:47:56,Bgrmystr2,but yeah I wouldn't consider a phone without that option
31-03-2018T21:48:17,TheBeckoner,"""hit him to death"" lool"
31-03-2018T21:48:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"""I can swim"" XD"
31-03-2018T21:48:47,TheBeckoner,Mine is somewhat water resistant. Not super concerned with water
31-03-2018T21:48:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Any phone can technically go underwater. I‚Äôve seen people wrap them in condoms before to do so
31-03-2018T21:49:00,TheBeckoner,Well switch off they can anyway

31-03-2018T23:25:10,PalmettoPathfinder1,Well I'm off to bed now.  Wish y'all a goodnight!  Tom enjoyed the stream.  You get some rest after this sketch!

31-03-2018T23:28:55,BadFoMo,A Mech? I thought a Jager was a Fighter Plane.
31-03-2018T23:29:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt know but it tried to guess
31-03-2018T23:29:05,Bgrmystr2,and why would you take one knowing it would attempt to tell you that?
31-03-2018T23:29:05,TheFDdriver,i dont know
31-03-2018T23:29:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Wondering if I‚Äôd get it right in any way
31-03-2018T23:29:27,TorqueEmUp,Jager is a mech from Pacific Rim
31-03-2018T23:29:35,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Ayup
31-03-2018T23:29:37,BadFoMo,...Or am I thinking that due to the show JAG?
31-03-2018T23:29:37,SpazztasticKiwi,*it‚Äôd
31-03-2018T23:29:47,ZRO4825,"If you're not in a relationship, ALL your relationships are open!"
31-03-2018T23:29:49,CrimsonHelsing,Jagers also require two pilots

31-03-2018T23:29:55,TheBeckoner,Lots of little details in a Jager sketch I would think...
31-03-2018T23:29:59,Alphawolf333,"and i thought Jager was a 3-speed, spawn-peeking, counter terrorist operator"
31-03-2018T23:30:01,TheBeckoner,like a ton
31-03-2018T23:30:05,Bgrmystr2,the first movie isn't bad

31-03-2018T23:30:17,CrimsonHelsing,Me neither
31-03-2018T23:30:17,TorqueEmUp,Second one is passable
31-03-2018T23:30:17,DarthKeidran,"So if Keith and Natani piloted a Pacific Rim J√§ger together, would Keith be able to mentally communicate with Zen?"
31-03-2018T23:30:20,TheBeckoner,Second one was pretty good imo
31-03-2018T23:30:27,TheBeckoner,no bones to pick from me
31-03-2018T23:30:35,TorqueEmUp,"and I mean that is a good way, not that you should pass it up."

31-03-2018T23:31:22,DarthKeidran,"Also, because of the mind link, does that mean only one of the two need physically be in the J√§ger to pilot it."
31-03-2018T23:31:31,WIPKING,I really like this sketch glad i didnt miss it
31-03-2018T23:31:31,Bgrmystr2,all I super care about is if they still have Glados as the AI voice chick

31-03-2018T23:43:49,BluePhantom90,hmm cute. Its been a while with Nat and Keith together moment

31-03-2018T23:45:07,Vatruvius,WIPKIND...Natani is both a guy and a girl...depends on the moment and how she feels. Though I personally identify her as a girl.
31-03-2018T23:45:17,WIPKING,Me too

31-03-2018T23:46:22,TheFDdriver,nice one Tom
31-03-2018T23:46:23,totallynotTrace,wip Natani is female but comonly identifies as a guy in the begining althrough later on it gets complicated and im not sure at this point
31-03-2018T23:46:24,DarthKeidran,Sorry bout that.
31-03-2018T23:46:29,Bgrmystr2,yeah this would be a great color
31-03-2018T23:46:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'd vote for it
31-03-2018T23:46:45,TheFDdriver,indeed
31-03-2018T23:46:49,Ordithus,"@TorqueEmUp Yeah, a modern setting is something different"
31-03-2018T23:46:50,totallynotTrace,10/10 would ship
31-03-2018T23:46:52,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Aye, same"
31-03-2018T23:46:52,ZRO4825,I vote for nothing! Mwahahaha!!! :joy:
31-03-2018T23:46:55,TorqueEmUp,"What I mean is, it'd look even more amazing colored."
31-03-2018T23:46:57,Kamaro12,I think she's just a really masculine girl
31-03-2018T23:47:06,Bgrmystr2,Natani identifies as a guy because half of her mind was destroyed and had to be supplemented by Zen's mind.
31-03-2018T23:47:13,WIPKING,Ok thanks for clarifying
31-03-2018T23:47:13,TheBeckoner,Sax song?
