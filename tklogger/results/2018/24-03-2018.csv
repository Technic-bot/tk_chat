24-03-2018T17:44:06,BadFoMo,"@Xexanoth Maybe it was just due to everyone spaming ""#YourKeyPhraseHere""."
24-03-2018T17:44:10,CheeseRS,Because it has the best bang for buck for me and its one of the best GPU's on the second hand market

24-03-2018T17:49:28,Ordithus,I've had good luck with XFX
24-03-2018T17:49:32,unsteddyphoenix,Well good luck
24-03-2018T17:49:34,CheeseRS,so the gtx 680 beats everything
24-03-2018T17:49:39,unsteddyphoenix,GPU prices have skyrocketed recently
24-03-2018T17:49:47,ThingsAreMoving,^

24-03-2018T17:50:27,MysticWarriorWolf,Xexa they recently went down i think
24-03-2018T17:50:50,Bgrmystr2,funny enough.. most GPUs are not actually USED for mining.. and their price is still through the roof. That's not because of the miners. That's cuz ppl want to make money off the situation
24-03-2018T17:50:53,MisterWho,ASUS 1070 Strix - 80‚Ç¨ rise in price. Lucky brother...
24-03-2018T17:51:04,CheeseRS,heh

24-03-2018T19:30:21,Bigboi182,Sorry about that...
24-03-2018T19:30:37,Bigboi182,I had to (attempt to) cook some salmon...
24-03-2018T19:30:46,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Maddie's such an adorable goof
24-03-2018T19:30:48,ThingsAreMoving,salmon is easy af to cook
24-03-2018T19:30:49,Bigboi182,And put it in my stomach...
24-03-2018T19:31:05,Xexanoth,should've gone with pizza instead
24-03-2018T19:31:08,Bgrmystr2,"Phoenix, if the party had intentions of ordering a pizza, even if it wasn't ordered at the time"
24-03-2018T19:31:11,Bgrmystr2,then it's still a pizza party
24-03-2018T19:31:15,Bgrmystr2,because the party is FOR the pizza.
24-03-2018T19:31:18,Bigboi182,"Not when it's your first time cooking, Things!"
24-03-2018T19:31:25,Bgrmystr2,and then everyone congratulates the pizza by eating it
24-03-2018T19:31:34,Bgrmystr2,it's very grusome
24-03-2018T19:31:34,unsteddyphoenix,what if it's a birthday party that planned on ordering pizza
24-03-2018T19:31:42,MviluUatusun,The pizza went to a better place.
24-03-2018T19:31:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Now I want pizza
24-03-2018T19:31:46,ThingsAreMoving,"first time cooking, or first time cooking salmon?"
24-03-2018T19:31:52,Bgrmystr2,then it's a birthday pizza party? :o
24-03-2018T19:31:57,MviluUatusun,"Oh, then it's a birthday pizza party."
24-03-2018T19:32:02,Bgrmystr2,see
24-03-2018T19:32:02,Bigboi182,First time cooking period.
24-03-2018T19:32:04,Bgrmystr2,Mvilu knows
24-03-2018T19:32:14,ThingsAreMoving,"then it is a bit hard, yeah"
24-03-2018T19:32:25,unsteddyphoenix,Now we know
24-03-2018T19:32:34,ThingsAreMoving,why would you attempt to cook salmon if you had no previous cooking experience
24-03-2018T19:32:41,Ordithus,^
24-03-2018T19:32:46,Bgrmystr2,"because everyone starts somewhere, Things."
24-03-2018T19:32:57,Xexanoth,"bigger question, how do you not have previous cooking experience?"
24-03-2018T19:33:06,Dadrobit,Back for a sec.
24-03-2018T19:33:11,Bgrmystr2,EVeryone had to do SOMETHING for their first time
24-03-2018T19:33:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,wb father
24-03-2018T19:33:13,Xexanoth,that's a very essential skill
24-03-2018T19:33:20,ThingsAreMoving,I'd start with heckin fishsticks to get some experience
24-03-2018T19:33:29,Bgrmystr2,"yeah but then you could say the same thing, Things"
24-03-2018T19:33:31,ZephyrTWolffox,back
24-03-2018T19:33:32,Xexanoth,but you learn cooking when you're a kid :/
24-03-2018T19:33:42,Ordithus,"Xex, Bigboi IS a kid"
24-03-2018T19:33:44,Bgrmystr2,why would you make fishsticks without experience? Why would you make ANYTHING without experience? :v
24-03-2018T19:33:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"Dadrobit, your name should be changed to popcorn"
24-03-2018T19:33:52,Dadrobit,"Also, pizza is super easy, fish you can burn in no time flat if you don't know wat you're doing."
24-03-2018T19:33:59,unsteddyphoenix,"Fish is complicated, normally you should start with something easier"
24-03-2018T19:34:02,Xexanoth,but you learn with supervision....
24-03-2018T19:34:06,Xexanoth,and something easy
24-03-2018T19:34:07,ZephyrTWolffox,I grill fish
24-03-2018T19:34:08,Ordithus,Salmon is best served raw~
24-03-2018T19:34:13,ThingsAreMoving,bgr I'm comparing the difficulty of cooking salmon to fishsticks
24-03-2018T19:34:14,ZephyrTWolffox,charcoal style
24-03-2018T19:34:15,Dadrobit,Popcorn?
24-03-2018T19:34:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Salmonella
24-03-2018T19:34:23,MviluUatusun,"Of course, Zephyr.  All fish have gills."
24-03-2018T19:34:26,Xexanoth,salmon is best thrown back in the water
24-03-2018T19:34:32,Xexanoth,and then you go get a steak
24-03-2018T19:34:32,SpazztasticKiwi,You keep popping in and out üòÑ
24-03-2018T19:34:33,MviluUatusun,"Oh, wait a minute.  I misread.  Never mind."
24-03-2018T19:34:34,ZephyrTWolffox,hurrrrrr
24-03-2018T19:34:57,MysticWarriorWolf,oi
24-03-2018T19:35:06,ThingsAreMoving,o/
24-03-2018T19:35:25,Dadrobit,"You're right, if I really was tring to be a dad, I'd pop out to the corner store for a sec, and then ~never~ come back."
24-03-2018T19:35:32,Dadrobit,trying*
24-03-2018T19:35:39,ThingsAreMoving,"wow, harsh"
24-03-2018T19:35:43,Bigboi182,"@Ordithus, at least you remembered!"
24-03-2018T19:35:47,ZephyrTWolffox,wow
24-03-2018T19:36:02,Dadrobit,(I love my father btw)
24-03-2018T19:36:04,Bgrmystr2,"Things, no matter how you go about it, cooking fishsticks will not give you experience cooking salmon. So even if you become a fishstick cook MASTER, you will still have zero experience cooking salmon."
24-03-2018T19:36:08,MysticWarriorWolf,"If i was trying to be dad the first thing i‚Äôd be saying would be ‚ÄúHi hungry, i‚Äôm dad!‚Äù"
24-03-2018T19:36:13,MviluUatusun,"I miss mine, Dad."
24-03-2018T19:36:24,Dadrobit,"Oh, I've done that plenty Myst"
24-03-2018T19:36:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I kinda do too sometimes
24-03-2018T19:36:34,unsteddyphoenix,Would have experience cooking in general though
24-03-2018T19:36:40,Xexanoth,^
24-03-2018T19:36:42,Bgrmystr2,"yes, phoenix you would"
24-03-2018T19:36:53,Bgrmystr2,but that wasn't really the point he was making originally :u
24-03-2018T19:36:56,Bigboi182,"@Xexanoth To answer that question, because I'm LAZY."
24-03-2018T19:37:03,ThingsAreMoving,"Bgr when you're learning how to cook you start with simple stuff like fishsticks to learn how to controll temperature, how to handle hot pan and oil and then you proceed to heavy stuff like fresh fish"
24-03-2018T19:37:14,Ordithus,Seraphina here would be great for charring steak
24-03-2018T19:37:18,Xexanoth,"well, that's a valid reason ^^"
24-03-2018T19:37:20,Bgrmystr2,"You tell me this like I dunno how to cook things. But the thing is, I do."
24-03-2018T19:37:22,Bgrmystr2,so

24-03-2018T22:00:49,Vatruvius,We are trying to upgrade to a radio internet that provides double what I get now but that is slow going. Need to hire a tree climber.

24-03-2018T22:01:49,Vatruvius,What?

24-03-2018T22:02:45,Vatruvius,"Satelite here gives about 1Mb/s, DSl gives 5Mb/s, and this radio one will give 12Mb/s. This is all megabits per second."
24-03-2018T22:04:22,Vatruvius,I think that is right...now you got me all confused @qwe304!
24-03-2018T22:05:13,Vatruvius,"Quick google search resulted in...yes, I am correct."

24-03-2018T22:07:10,Bgrmystr2,but you need to pay for two of them and have your ISP give you a link box
24-03-2018T22:07:41,Bgrmystr2,and you'll get twice the speed because the box will fuse both internets into one source for your home
24-03-2018T22:07:42,qwe304,"i get decent internet, not good ping though"
24-03-2018T22:08:06,Bgrmystr2,you'd have to ask your ISP about it though

24-03-2018T22:08:46,Vatruvius,One problem to that...besides the fact that my ISP is no longer supporting the creation of new lines...they charge you an arm and a leg for what shit they are giving me now.

24-03-2018T22:09:12,Bgrmystr2,that's 12mbit/s
24-03-2018T22:09:17,Bgrmystr2,talk to them
24-03-2018T22:10:30,Vatruvius,"I could, though I am not sure how they would handle. They would have to put up two antennas and we need a tree climber to mount them which is $200/hr to get one so...I do not think so."
24-03-2018T22:10:51,Vatruvius,"Besides, this new network...when we get it...will double what I have now anyway."
24-03-2018T22:11:28,Bgrmystr2,12mbit is slow as balls

24-03-2018T22:11:38,Dadrobit,cya marv
24-03-2018T22:11:41,Vatruvius,But is it faster then 5mb/t
24-03-2018T22:11:55,Bgrmystr2,5mbit is basically nothing
24-03-2018T22:12:04,qwe304,your ping is probably going to be horrible
24-03-2018T22:12:34,Ordithus,"I remember, back in the day.  30ish kbps.  It felt slow then"
24-03-2018T22:12:38,Vatruvius,Well...these are professional tree climbers that usually trim trees. They do it spike-less and mount the antenna up and bring the wire down to the house. Plus...I do not think they have any competition up here.
24-03-2018T22:13:35,Vatruvius,"My ping actually is not that bad...30ms is pretty standard for me. Just high bandwidth things like downloading is super slow. Plus, I cannot watch anything above 720p on a good day."
24-03-2018T22:14:10,Ordithus,Tom's stream must wreck your internet
24-03-2018T22:14:24,Vatruvius,Do you know how long it took for Steam to download Doom 2016? Steam literally said 17 days...
24-03-2018T22:14:48,Vatruvius,Yeah...I need what a 720p video needs to play the stream with no hiccups.
24-03-2018T22:15:01,Vatruvius,Better than what my phone gets though.
24-03-2018T22:17:46,Vatruvius,"And yes, our current ISP charges an arm and a leg for the 5Mbps we get now. $150+ per month."
24-03-2018T22:17:49,Vatruvius,lol
24-03-2018T22:17:57,Vatruvius,whisper fail
24-03-2018T22:18:06,CrRAR,That's craaazy
24-03-2018T22:18:26,CrRAR,my condolences
24-03-2018T22:18:55,qwe304,"RIP, i pay $100 for 70Mb/ps"
24-03-2018T22:19:16,Vatruvius,Yeah...with an additional $50 every time we go over our limit which is only 150GB. Now for my home that is okay but they are messing up on tracking and saying we use something like 500GB a month. They send us letters but then they don't charge us.
24-03-2018T22:19:19,Bgrmystr2,bout $70-80 for a 100mbit line here.
24-03-2018T22:19:23,Vatruvius,"AT&T sucks, do not recommend."
24-03-2018T22:19:40,Bgrmystr2,AT&T is trash
24-03-2018T22:19:43,Bgrmystr2,always has been
24-03-2018T22:19:45,Bgrmystr2,always will be
24-03-2018T22:19:52,Bgrmystr2,noone's gonna make them better
24-03-2018T22:20:25,Dadrobit,"Alright, I think I'm gonna head out for the night peeps!"
24-03-2018T22:20:34,Ordithus,Good night robit!
24-03-2018T22:20:37,CrRAR,I think tyrannical stuff like that flies only when they have a monopoly over an area. Yeh AT&T still is the worst though.
24-03-2018T22:20:41,CrRAR,Bye Robit
24-03-2018T22:20:43,Vatruvius,Goodnight Dadrobit!
24-03-2018T22:20:45,CrRAR,nighty night
24-03-2018T22:22:17,unsteddyphoenix,night daddy
24-03-2018T22:24:45,Vatruvius,The radio waves do better with direct line of sight. So on a tree top is the only way direct line of sight can be achieved. Direct line of sight gives 12Mbps while through trees gives 8Mbps.
24-03-2018T22:24:54,Vatruvius,anther whisper fail
24-03-2018T22:25:03,Vatruvius,I will get the hang of this...I swear!
24-03-2018T22:25:20,Bgrmystr2,"don't worry, sometimes whispers just don't work"
24-03-2018T22:25:24,Bgrmystr2,and go to the public chat
24-03-2018T22:25:32,Bgrmystr2,even if you have the whisper thing at the beginnign
24-03-2018T22:25:35,Vatruvius,Why does isn't read my mind and make it a whisper! Agh!
24-03-2018T22:25:38,Bgrmystr2,happened to me a few times :/
24-03-2018T22:25:57,Bgrmystr2,"all it would need to do is when you press enter, keep the / whisper to whoever you were talkin to"
24-03-2018T22:26:03,Ordithus,At least you didn't say anything too embarrassing :ctwokinds-rose:
24-03-2018T22:26:31,Vatruvius,"Like what @Ordithus, I presume there is a story here?"
24-03-2018T22:26:43,Ordithus,Probably.  I'm too tired to remember
24-03-2018T22:27:25,Vatruvius,Good cover.
24-03-2018T22:27:38,Vatruvius,:P
24-03-2018T22:27:47,CrRAR,lol Vatruvius is that using Ubiquiti dishes?
24-03-2018T22:28:30,Vatruvius,"I do not know, they provide and install them. We still have to schedule them to come over so I will find out then."
24-03-2018T22:29:36,CrRAR,"ahh I see, probably something similar, pretty cool tech. Gets the job done. haha"
24-03-2018T22:30:02,Vatruvius,Hey...if it beats DSL I will take it.
24-03-2018T22:31:18,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
24-03-2018T22:31:28,CrRAR,Evals approved
24-03-2018T22:32:03,Vatruvius,Good...he was my go to man.
24-03-2018T22:32:11,Vatruvius,Or dog rather.
24-03-2018T22:32:22,Ordithus,Man-dog
24-03-2018T22:34:11,Bigboi182,Is Tom still active? Or is he leaving his account on?
24-03-2018T22:34:42,Vatruvius,He responded a half hour ago.
24-03-2018T22:34:59,Vatruvius,Probably just doing stuff and checking in every now and again.
24-03-2018T22:35:40,Bigboi182,Ok.
24-03-2018T22:36:11,Vatruvius,"He does not love you Bigboi, he will never respond to you or even read you comments! Mwuhahahahahaha! :P"
24-03-2018T22:36:20,Bigboi182,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO....
24-03-2018T22:37:13,Bigboi182,XD that was so evil Vat...
24-03-2018T22:37:35,Bigboi182,So everyone else just retired to their beds or something?
24-03-2018T22:37:49,Vatruvius,Hahaha! :smiling_imp:
24-03-2018T22:38:07,Vatruvius,I think so...that or are multitasking very poorly.
24-03-2018T22:38:48,Bigboi182,"Multitasking sucks, so I don't blame them..."
24-03-2018T22:39:00,Ordithus,Watching Heresy and HISHE
24-03-2018T22:39:04,Vatruvius,Not that humans can actually multitask...rather juggle between tasks. So they are juggling very poorly.

24-03-2018T22:40:17,Vatruvius,Yes!
24-03-2018T22:40:23,Bgrmystr2,See!
24-03-2018T22:41:41,Bigboi182,Exactly!
24-03-2018T22:41:52,Vatruvius,I am a down to Earth really nice guy and love to do nice things for other people. In D&D I am always the valiant Knight type character and doing good....but sometimes I like to be the devious villain. The mastermind behind all things type.
24-03-2018T22:42:03,Bgrmystr2,I'm glad we're all agreed on that one lol
24-03-2018T22:42:18,Vatruvius,:rofl:

24-03-2018T22:45:18,Ordithus,Hi Night.  :ctwokinds-RainezZz:
24-03-2018T22:45:35,Vatruvius,"Just hanging on by a thread, huh @Ordithus?"

24-03-2018T22:46:26,Vatruvius,How much snow?
24-03-2018T22:46:33,Bigboi182,It has been 90+ degrees consistently for a week.

24-03-2018T22:47:35,Bigboi182,That's him wishing he was here.
24-03-2018T22:47:39,Bigboi182,Sorry...

24-03-2018T22:48:05,Bigboi182,I think.
24-03-2018T22:48:23,Bigboi182,It could've snowed 2 feet or something.
24-03-2018T22:48:24,NightMeaty22,utah has weard weather
24-03-2018T22:48:41,Bigboi182,The whole US has weird weather.

24-03-2018T22:50:56,Vatruvius,Ouch...that hurts.
24-03-2018T22:51:08,NightMeaty22,last one we had was 9 years ago
24-03-2018T22:52:01,Vatruvius,I remember my cousins who live down in the valley and never get snow got a snow day when it hailed and covered the sidewalks. While I had 5 inches and it snowed overnight so the snowplows cleared the schools making it a school day.
24-03-2018T22:52:28,Vatruvius,BRB
24-03-2018T22:54:47,NightMeaty22,the closest thing i have got to a snow day in 9 years was when they had school start 1 hour late this was last year and it snowed 3 ft
24-03-2018T22:55:19,Ordithus,That's a bit of snow
24-03-2018T22:57:26,NightMeaty22,i dont grammers
24-03-2018T23:00:42,Bigboi182,I notice.
24-03-2018T23:00:54,Bigboi182,Good thing I don't have OCD...

24-03-2018T23:03:00,Bigboi182,"I have typed on a phone before, and it is absolute hell."
24-03-2018T23:03:10,NightMeaty22,yep
24-03-2018T23:03:35,NightMeaty22,oh well üôÉ
24-03-2018T23:04:40,Bigboi182,I understand the pain.
24-03-2018T23:05:42,NightMeaty22,pain is when you some how get stabed under your finger nails
24-03-2018T23:06:53,NightMeaty22,or when you kick the wall bare foot
24-03-2018T23:07:45,NightMeaty22,wall + mart = walmart¬ø
24-03-2018T23:09:37,Bigboi182,gee.
24-03-2018T23:09:47,Bigboi182,BRB.
24-03-2018T23:22:58,Vatruvius,I hate it when I go to grab some sticks to build a fire and one of them just stabs me under the nail. So painful...and it never goes away for hours.
24-03-2018T23:26:06,Vatruvius,There's a fair amount of people logged into the stream chat...what are they all doing? Heellllooooo!?!
24-03-2018T23:37:08,Bigboi182,Yo.
24-03-2018T23:37:20,Bigboi182,"Sorry, had to get some food."
24-03-2018T23:37:36,Bigboi182,"You did see me say BRB, right?"
24-03-2018T23:39:00,Bgrmystr2,no
24-03-2018T23:39:01,Bgrmystr2,noone did
24-03-2018T23:39:04,Bgrmystr2,you didn't say it
24-03-2018T23:39:09,Bgrmystr2,:v
24-03-2018T23:39:20,Bgrmystr2,and we can't see you say anything anyway
24-03-2018T23:39:44,Ordithus,So much sass
24-03-2018T23:40:23,Vatruvius,"I say it,  I was talking to the other 18 users that are on. Seems they are shy."
24-03-2018T23:40:27,Vatruvius,saw*
24-03-2018T23:43:11,Ordithus,Hoo boy look at the time.  Good night! :ctwokinds-natanisleep:
24-03-2018T23:43:32,Bigboi182,Well that was unexpected...
24-03-2018T23:44:13,Vatruvius,Nice quote Bigboi...Goodnight @Ordithus!
24-03-2018T23:44:15,Bigboi182,"Bgr, you really can't see the conversation I had with Night that's right above what you just said?"
24-03-2018T23:47:22,Vatruvius,"If you did not know @Bigboi182, you unexpectedly quoted Catherine from SOMA."
24-03-2018T23:49:30,Bigboi182,Oh.
24-03-2018T23:49:45,Bigboi182,"That's cool, I guess."
24-03-2018T23:50:50,Bgrmystr2,"Big, there's this thing called sarcasm. Also, there's a difference between seeing you say something, seeing you type something, and seeing something you typed"
24-03-2018T23:50:53,Bgrmystr2,all three are different
24-03-2018T23:51:02,Bgrmystr2,and you picked one that was wrong
24-03-2018T23:51:05,Bgrmystr2,I was just poking fun at it.
24-03-2018T23:51:08,Bgrmystr2,:v
24-03-2018T23:51:46,Bgrmystr2,I am allowed to be sassy
24-03-2018T23:51:51,Bgrmystr2,*snap snap snap*
24-03-2018T23:59:01,Bigboi182,Ok.
24-03-2018T23:59:14,Bigboi182,I'm not gonna be extra on you.
24-03-2018T23:59:27,Bigboi182,though you kinda did it on me.
24-03-2018T23:59:41,Bigboi182,"So.... yeah, movin on..."
