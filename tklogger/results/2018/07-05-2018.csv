07-05-2018T00:00:06,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe Sirius
07-05-2018T00:00:07,Ordithus,Lynn's age is unkown
07-05-2018T00:00:18,Mippy,^ true
07-05-2018T00:00:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Let’s play “who’s gonna go crazy first”
07-05-2018T00:00:58,Ordithus,Kat
07-05-2018T00:01:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Kat’s probably more frustrated with life than going crazy
07-05-2018T00:01:35,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:
07-05-2018T00:01:57,unsteddyphoenix,Kats sister is the crazy one~
07-05-2018T00:02:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"I know her kind of pain, or at least I can understand it"
07-05-2018T00:02:18,unsteddyphoenix,Even I can emphasize with her
07-05-2018T00:02:33,SpazztasticKiwi,She’s still young enough to find someone better though
07-05-2018T00:03:00,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah! Theres no rush for her :ctwokinds-katdryer:
07-05-2018T00:03:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Might be another human. The Keidran seem to all go for outside their species
07-05-2018T00:03:42,unsteddyphoenix,Shes only just starting a freed life
07-05-2018T00:03:56,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, Flora and Kat do."
07-05-2018T00:04:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Not all but most anyway
07-05-2018T00:04:00,unsteddyphoenix,'cause theyre weirdos
07-05-2018T00:04:07,Ordithus,Natani too
07-05-2018T00:04:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Hey foreign can be fun
07-05-2018T00:05:31,unsteddyphoenix,exotic!
07-05-2018T00:05:48,unsteddyphoenix,"Though, they were both raised with humans so not so much for them"
07-05-2018T00:05:55,Ordithus,Dangerous.  Laura went outside of her species and she exploded.
07-05-2018T00:06:23,unsteddyphoenix,Alaric stayed within his species though
07-05-2018T00:06:24,Twokinds,It's true
07-05-2018T00:07:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Which part Tom?
07-05-2018T00:07:45,Twokinds,Everything.
07-05-2018T00:07:47,unsteddyphoenix,Theyre...both true.
07-05-2018T00:07:53,unsteddyphoenix,Unless Alaric has a secret~
07-05-2018T00:08:20,Mippy,Oh come on Unsteddy. We all know Alaric is not dead. He is masquarading as Lynn. Buying his time
07-05-2018T00:08:26,BadFoMo,Which secret? UH- What secret?
07-05-2018T00:08:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"As for Laura’s situation, that had other special circumstances"
07-05-2018T00:08:51,SpazztasticKiwi,And you can’t expect there to be no risks
07-05-2018T00:09:03,Twokinds,"Every notice that every person that got between Natani and Keith ended up dead? Suspicious, Natani..."
07-05-2018T00:09:14,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
07-05-2018T00:09:30,Mippy,*gasp*
07-05-2018T00:09:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"Don’t mess with a good thing, duh"
07-05-2018T00:09:33,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: Natani pls
07-05-2018T00:09:40,unsteddyphoenix,Laura died twice even!
07-05-2018T00:09:46,unsteddyphoenix,Kat please be careful
07-05-2018T00:09:58,Bgrmystr2,"Lost all her souls, too, phoenix :ptv-shock:"
07-05-2018T00:10:04,unsteddyphoenix,Hahaha
07-05-2018T00:10:09,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s also magic involved with these characters so there’s that to think of too
07-05-2018T00:10:10,Twokinds,Natani IS an assassin. A shipping assassin.
07-05-2018T00:10:21,SpazztasticKiwi,“Not on ma boat!”
07-05-2018T00:10:32,unsteddyphoenix,She kills for love! But just her love.
07-05-2018T00:10:38,Ordithus,Is Youngtani next?
07-05-2018T00:10:43,unsteddyphoenix,Sort of a very selfish cupid
07-05-2018T00:11:10,SpazztasticKiwi,“I will make this ship work if I have to sink everyone else”
07-05-2018T00:11:42,SpazztasticKiwi,*swings sword at head* “It’s true love!”
07-05-2018T00:12:20,BadFoMo,The song Tanted Love is now playing in my head.
07-05-2018T00:12:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Keith’s not my type anyway so I’m good
07-05-2018T00:12:37,Ordithus,She even wouldn't let Keith end the ship himself.
07-05-2018T00:13:34,Mippy,I'm good with Keith... yeah...
07-05-2018T00:14:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I mean the only real character that comes close for me is Daniels and he’s just pretty attractive. But he’s taken and I doubt I’d date someone like him anyway
07-05-2018T00:15:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Gotta be living and not already involved with someone else
07-05-2018T00:15:43,BadFoMo,It's Tanted Love or Notice Me Senpai.
07-05-2018T00:16:10,unsteddyphoenix,Not a Carver fan?
07-05-2018T00:17:23,Mippy,"Craver is taht guy I never expected to see again to be honest.... but we did get a glimps of ""the west"" out of it..soooo"
07-05-2018T00:17:41,unsteddyphoenix,He'll live on through sketch suggestions
07-05-2018T00:18:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Carver? Not really
07-05-2018T00:18:13,SiliconCarbide,"we only had one carver suggestions so far though, right?"
07-05-2018T00:18:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Not a big fan
07-05-2018T00:18:50,Ordithus,"The one where he dropped into Clovis's bath, yeah."
07-05-2018T00:18:57,SiliconCarbide,thats the one
07-05-2018T00:19:02,unsteddyphoenix,Oooh! What about Mister Spy! He's so mysterious~
07-05-2018T00:19:10,SiliconCarbide,what about brutus then kiwi?
07-05-2018T00:19:24,unsteddyphoenix,Lol Brutus is a cutie~
07-05-2018T00:19:25,SiliconCarbide,hes a hardworking man that cares about his coworkers
07-05-2018T00:20:11,Twokinds,It's true
07-05-2018T00:20:42,BadFoMo,"@SiliconCarbide There was that one where insted of Western Basitins, he meets Merfolk."
07-05-2018T00:20:52,Mippy,"Yeah, Brutus seems pretty decent."
07-05-2018T00:21:09,unsteddyphoenix,And has no qualms about walking around topless
07-05-2018T00:21:13,BadFoMo,"...Well, it was in the polls."
07-05-2018T00:21:14,unsteddyphoenix,Which is a plus
07-05-2018T00:21:18,Ordithus,We haven't seen him do anything evil.  Even though he works for Clovis.
07-05-2018T00:22:35,SiliconCarbide,"speaking of coworkers i gotta get to work, byyyye"
07-05-2018T00:22:45,unsteddyphoenix,o/
07-05-2018T00:22:50,Ordithus,Bye Si
07-05-2018T00:22:58,Mippy,bye
07-05-2018T00:24:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Brutus...
07-05-2018T00:25:02,unsteddyphoenix,Even him!
07-05-2018T00:25:08,SpazztasticKiwi,If he had no ill effects from being around Clovis
07-05-2018T00:25:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I don’t go for the obviously attractive. Muscle isn’t terribly impressive to me
07-05-2018T00:25:59,unsteddyphoenix,"He probably has...loose morals...but, yknow."
07-05-2018T00:26:05,unsteddyphoenix,Gotta make a living.
07-05-2018T00:26:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m picky I guess
07-05-2018T00:26:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Better than stuck with someone incompatible
07-05-2018T00:26:50,Ordithus,This is a comic where the protagonist is an amnesiac genocidal maniac
07-05-2018T00:27:02,Mippy,^
07-05-2018T00:27:08,Ordithus,"And two others are assassins, noted for their track record"
07-05-2018T00:27:54,unsteddyphoenix,It does seem pretty noteworthy
07-05-2018T00:28:42,Ordithus,"Sythe is a pretty good guy, though.  No murderin'"
07-05-2018T00:29:01,Ordithus,And he's available~
07-05-2018T00:29:35,Mippy,Sythe is..... *shrug*
07-05-2018T00:30:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Sythe seems sweet
07-05-2018T00:30:52,SpazztasticKiwi,But nah
07-05-2018T00:33:08,Mippy,"I don't know...Kaidren don't tickle my fancy that much. I guess I'm just ""Basitinsexual"" I don't know about Kiwi though"
07-05-2018T00:34:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I can admit they all got something going for them but they don’t impress me to much
07-05-2018T00:34:22,SpazztasticKiwi,*too
07-05-2018T00:34:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Guess I’m more humansexual
07-05-2018T00:35:44,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, I wont judge dont worry."
07-05-2018T00:37:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"For example if it wouldn’t hurt Kat and he didn’t go after everything with boobs, Eric is interesting with his knack for the arts"
07-05-2018T00:37:51,Ordithus,He's learned.  And rich.
07-05-2018T00:37:57,Mippy,I admit...If I wanted a human..Eric would be nice.
07-05-2018T00:37:59,unsteddyphoenix,He is the intellectual type...though how could you ever trust him.
07-05-2018T00:38:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t care if he can buy his own island
07-05-2018T00:38:46,Mippy,"^ Yeah, but poverty hurts"
07-05-2018T00:38:57,unsteddyphoenix,Struggle is real
07-05-2018T00:39:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"If his eyes are gonna wonder, he can buy himself a blow up doll and leave me alone"
07-05-2018T00:40:05,unsteddyphoenix,I dont think he needs one
07-05-2018T00:40:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"As for education, you’re always learning. Provided you’re willing"
07-05-2018T00:41:26,unsteddyphoenix,Not everyone is
07-05-2018T00:41:35,SpazztasticKiwi,My point
07-05-2018T00:43:02,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s a line between confidence stubbornness and stupidity
07-05-2018T00:44:26,SpazztasticKiwi,But I’m pretty sure I’m not getting married anytime soon anyway. Dating isn’t even on the table at the moment. Gotta actually go out for that
07-05-2018T00:44:35,SpazztasticKiwi,And I like the indoors
07-05-2018T00:44:58,Mippy,Yeah...I'm pretty much a hermit myself
07-05-2018T00:47:15,Mippy,Dang...it rained for like the first time this year
07-05-2018T00:50:27,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s supposed to be raining for us. We got a small storm a few days ago and that was pretty much it
07-05-2018T00:51:22,Mippy,Westerrn weathr...meh
07-05-2018T00:51:36,Ordithus,"Now to Ollie with the weather.   ""It's gonna rain!"""
07-05-2018T00:51:44,unsteddyphoenix,Thanks Ollie!
07-05-2018T00:52:27,Ordithus,Forecast to rain pretty much all week here.
07-05-2018T00:53:38,Ordithus,"Anyways, good night! :ctwokinds-RainezZz:"
07-05-2018T00:53:45,Mippy,"Ive got sun all week, except now and thursday. Stupid western weather"
07-05-2018T00:53:52,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-natanisleep:
07-05-2018T00:54:26,Mippy,Yeahh...it's baasically midnight. I should zzzzzzzzzzzz tooo
07-05-2018T00:56:53,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s nearly 1 for me
07-05-2018T00:57:23,SpazztasticKiwi,And we get alot of spotty rain bursts
07-05-2018T00:57:27,CrimsonHelsing,"same, just popping in to see if anything went on"
07-05-2018T00:57:35,CrimsonHelsing,and really kiwi?
07-05-2018T00:57:38,unsteddyphoenix,Not this day
07-05-2018T00:57:57,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah our weathers pretty unpredictable as well
07-05-2018T00:58:11,CrimsonHelsing,ikr? xD
07-05-2018T00:58:39,CrimsonHelsing,"that's why everyone always responds to whoever says ""beautiful weather today huh?"" ""wait five minutes, it'll change"""
07-05-2018T01:07:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"Yeah really. Weather is ever changing, especially around season changes"
07-05-2018T01:25:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to get my drink but kitty is sitting on lap
07-05-2018T01:27:38,unsteddyphoenix,gotta wait it out~
07-05-2018T01:30:02,Bgrmystr2,I'd just move
07-05-2018T01:30:08,Bgrmystr2,Kitty can move too
07-05-2018T01:30:19,Bgrmystr2,"and when I sit back down, kitty can sit right back down"
07-05-2018T01:30:46,unsteddyphoenix,Bgr thats completely ridiculous. :T
07-05-2018T01:31:28,Bgrmystr2,"maybe to you, captain cat-for-brains &gt;:U"
07-05-2018T01:31:32,NickTheName,Good morning (or whatever time you have)
07-05-2018T01:31:47,Bgrmystr2,The cat chose to lay down on a bed that moves. It has to deal with the bed moving someties
07-05-2018T01:31:50,Bgrmystr2,times* even
07-05-2018T01:33:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"Bagheera is pretty flexible when it comes to sitting on my lap. If I roll to the side, he just moves with me"
07-05-2018T01:34:23,SpazztasticKiwi,“I have chosen to sit here. You’re not changing my mind”
07-05-2018T01:34:28,Bgrmystr2,See?
07-05-2018T01:34:30,Bgrmystr2,perfect
07-05-2018T01:35:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Really likes sitting under the covers though
07-05-2018T01:35:59,unsteddyphoenix,weird
07-05-2018T01:36:12,unsteddyphoenix,Normally thats not a thing cats like
07-05-2018T01:36:25,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s not a normal cat
07-05-2018T01:36:44,SpazztasticKiwi,At all
07-05-2018T01:37:34,SpazztasticKiwi,“Oh you’re doing something? I don’t care. Pet me”
07-05-2018T01:37:47,unsteddyphoenix,no that sounds normal
07-05-2018T01:39:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"According to Tom, it’s a habit of Holly’s too"
07-05-2018T01:39:25,Twokinds,She's right here.
07-05-2018T01:39:42,unsteddyphoenix,Nice~ tell her hi
07-05-2018T01:39:47,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-katdryer:
07-05-2018T01:40:09,SpazztasticKiwi,:ctwokinds-traceflohug:CAT!
07-05-2018T01:40:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Hi Holly! :ptv-greetings:
07-05-2018T01:41:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"Funny thing is, Kiwi will sit in any lap provided she knows the person. Bagheera follows only me"
07-05-2018T01:41:49,unsteddyphoenix,Bag is the young one right?
07-05-2018T01:41:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Almost 2
07-05-2018T01:42:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Kiwi’s 7
07-05-2018T01:42:30,unsteddyphoenix,d'aw~
07-05-2018T01:42:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"And if he’s in trouble, he runs to my room"
07-05-2018T01:42:59,SpazztasticKiwi,“Ma! They’re yelling at me!”
07-05-2018T01:43:17,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-daydreamingkat: so cute~
07-05-2018T01:43:23,unsteddyphoenix,Im so jealous
07-05-2018T01:44:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I might be ok with this kind of child
07-05-2018T01:44:42,unsteddyphoenix,"Does he get in like, fights?"
07-05-2018T01:44:48,unsteddyphoenix,with other cat?
07-05-2018T01:45:12,SpazztasticKiwi,He can make a pest out of himself by chasing them to play when the others don’t want to
07-05-2018T01:45:29,SpazztasticKiwi,But he’s never really attacked any of them
07-05-2018T01:45:41,unsteddyphoenix,Ah so he's just annoying
07-05-2018T01:45:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Typical young son
07-05-2018T01:46:17,unsteddyphoenix,WHy have children when you can have cats tbh
07-05-2018T01:46:49,SpazztasticKiwi,My kind of thoughts exactly
07-05-2018T01:47:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"Cats don’t go to school, don’t use diapers...good times"
07-05-2018T01:48:03,unsteddyphoenix,Way less stress
07-05-2018T01:48:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Some people don’t see their cats as their kids though
07-05-2018T01:48:24,SpazztasticKiwi,For some people it’s stress
07-05-2018T01:48:35,unsteddyphoenix,How bizzare.
07-05-2018T01:49:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I just touched Bagheera and he jumped so hard
07-05-2018T01:49:14,SpazztasticKiwi,He wasn’t paying any attention
07-05-2018T01:49:18,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-floAAA:
07-05-2018T01:50:01,unsteddyphoenix,Spooking cats is also fun
07-05-2018T01:50:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"Tom, you know how Holly is with other cats?"
07-05-2018T01:50:36,Twokinds,"I don't know, she's never interacted with other casts"
07-05-2018T01:50:38,Twokinds,cats
07-05-2018T01:50:43,Twokinds,"But I have to imagine, terrified."
07-05-2018T01:50:57,unsteddyphoenix,Holly has ONE friend
07-05-2018T01:50:58,Twokinds,She's terrified of everything.
07-05-2018T01:51:00,SpazztasticKiwi,“What is THAT?”
07-05-2018T01:51:09,unsteddyphoenix,Oh no~ poor thing
07-05-2018T01:51:11,SpazztasticKiwi,“Why does it look like me?!?”
07-05-2018T01:51:13,Twokinds,She's afraid of cardboard boxes.
07-05-2018T01:51:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Poor baby
07-05-2018T01:51:21,unsteddyphoenix,ODD.
07-05-2018T01:51:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Are you sure she’s a cat?
07-05-2018T01:51:40,Twokinds,"Though that's probably because when she was little, I liked trapping her under cardboard boxes."
07-05-2018T01:51:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Thomas
07-05-2018T01:52:03,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s just mean
07-05-2018T01:52:06,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
07-05-2018T01:52:13,unsteddyphoenix,"Ok there's ""messing with"" and there's ""instilling a lifelong trauma"""
07-05-2018T01:52:40,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s messing with them and there’s hurting them mentally
07-05-2018T01:53:03,unsteddyphoenix,Have you ever surrounded her with boxes to see how she escapes? :thinking:
07-05-2018T01:53:16,Twokinds,Hmmmm
07-05-2018T01:53:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Then again Kiwi’s afraid of men and idk why
07-05-2018T01:53:27,unsteddyphoenix,"Because men like Tom exist, clearly."
07-05-2018T01:53:36,zolstarym,I trapped mine in an upside down trashcan once. She kinda just napped in it and didn't want to leave
07-05-2018T01:53:51,unsteddyphoenix,lmao
07-05-2018T01:53:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’m talking instant “nope” when she hears, sees or smells a guy"
07-05-2018T01:54:00,unsteddyphoenix,classic
07-05-2018T01:55:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Doesn’t even like the local minister
07-05-2018T01:55:22,Bgrmystr2,"damn, tom. Mean xD"
07-05-2018T01:55:43,Twokinds,I think Holly's just so scared because she's never been exposed to other people or things.
07-05-2018T01:55:52,Twokinds,She's just pretty much existed in my room with me her whole life.
07-05-2018T01:56:05,Twokinds,"I try to get her out, but she just doesn't want to."
07-05-2018T01:56:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Kiwi in a nutshell. Though she will warm up to a female eventually
07-05-2018T01:56:24,unsteddyphoenix,Now shes the most cowardly yandere...
07-05-2018T01:56:39,Twokinds,She's bigger than three of my mom's dogs. But she's still scared of them.
07-05-2018T01:56:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Some cats are just destined to be indoor only
07-05-2018T01:56:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Do you know who or what she came from?
07-05-2018T01:56:58,unsteddyphoenix,Are they loud yappy tinydogs?
07-05-2018T01:57:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"If it’s Bell, Bubble, and Maggie, yes - small dogs"
07-05-2018T01:57:29,Twokinds,Yeah
07-05-2018T01:58:06,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds a bit scary
07-05-2018T01:58:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I suspect Kiwi’s fear to be from the son of the lady I got her from. He may not have been the nicest to animals
07-05-2018T01:58:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Only thing I can think of
07-05-2018T01:59:10,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe Holly's just naturally a weenie
07-05-2018T01:59:18,unsteddyphoenix,Just her personality
07-05-2018T01:59:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Sheltered
07-05-2018T01:59:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Or a chicken
07-05-2018T01:59:40,unsteddyphoenix,Both!
07-05-2018T02:00:16,Twokinds,I've thought about trapping her in a room with bell
07-05-2018T02:00:20,Twokinds,Until they get along.
07-05-2018T02:00:40,SpazztasticKiwi,You know that’s not how that works right
07-05-2018T02:01:06,unsteddyphoenix,"Actually, I hear you do that when they're both babies"
07-05-2018T02:01:19,unsteddyphoenix,And you give them drugs toake them docile
07-05-2018T02:01:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Neither are babies
07-05-2018T02:01:31,unsteddyphoenix,The ship has probably sailed yeah
07-05-2018T02:01:44,SpazztasticKiwi,And the drug thing is not a real good idea
07-05-2018T02:02:20,unsteddyphoenix,"You're moving out anyway, maybe she can learn independence I'm the new house"
07-05-2018T02:02:23,unsteddyphoenix,In
07-05-2018T02:02:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"Bagheera’s main issue is big dogs, but he investigates on his own when our big dogs are inside"
07-05-2018T02:03:10,SpazztasticKiwi,He tolerates them pretty well now. Doesn’t want to be terribly close but progress is progress
07-05-2018T02:03:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Holly will in all likelihood flip when you move. Hide for a few days in some crack and not want to eat much
07-05-2018T02:04:53,unsteddyphoenix,As long as Tom's there:ctwokinds-katdryer:
07-05-2018T02:06:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"She’ll calm down eventually I’m sure as long as he’s there yes, but I’ve also never met the cat so who knows"
07-05-2018T02:11:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Just don’t go introducing another cat and she should be fine :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
07-05-2018T02:12:11,unsteddyphoenix,Aw shucks guess tom can't get another cat how unlucky
07-05-2018T02:12:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Yep I heard he wanted to grow old with like 20
07-05-2018T02:12:57,SpazztasticKiwi,So sad he can’t live his dream
07-05-2018T02:13:34,unsteddyphoenix,Truly tragic
07-05-2018T02:15:25,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-LauraCry:
07-05-2018T02:17:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Hey I have a kitten if you’re that sad

07-05-2018T02:25:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"He’s also a little boy, so you can have man talk about tools and stuff"
07-05-2018T02:26:02,unsteddyphoenix,Can go outside and throw the pigskin around
07-05-2018T02:26:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"Speaking of, he’s crying brb"
07-05-2018T02:26:56,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-LauraCry:
07-05-2018T02:33:24,SpazztasticKiwi,And I’ve managed to turn Bagheera into a salt dispenser
07-05-2018T02:35:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Might be calling this kitten Sparky if he doesn’t learn to leave wires alone
07-05-2018T02:37:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"And in reality, I’m not giving this kitten to anyone who doesn’t want it or who gives me the wrong feel"
07-05-2018T02:45:57,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-kingtea: good good
07-05-2018T02:46:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok kitten stuffing face. I need something to do for the next hour or so
07-05-2018T02:49:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Darkness Falls it is
07-05-2018T02:53:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless we want to start another riveting conversation about cats
07-05-2018T02:57:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I do wonder what Tom’s up at 4 am for
07-05-2018T02:58:12,NickTheName,He is a vampire!
07-05-2018T02:58:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Explains the aversion of the outdoors

07-05-2018T03:00:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Doesn’t seem to sleep at all really
07-05-2018T03:01:07,SpazztasticKiwi,squints suspiciously

07-05-2018T03:18:29,unsteddyphoenix,But yeah great butt~
07-05-2018T03:18:33,SpazztasticKiwi,I like her craftyness
07-05-2018T03:19:12,unsteddyphoenix,She does have an array of talents
07-05-2018T03:19:19,unsteddyphoenix,Whats the term? Shes good with her hands?
07-05-2018T03:19:38,unsteddyphoenix,"Maybe ""crafty"" is rightr"
07-05-2018T03:20:03,SpazztasticKiwi,As am I but it’s more with paper crafty stuff
07-05-2018T03:21:03,unsteddyphoenix,I am not.

07-05-2018T04:03:48,NickTheName,He is sleeping or am I seeing something wrong?
07-05-2018T04:04:00,unsteddyphoenix,Sleep typing
07-05-2018T04:04:02,Bgrmystr2,"Sleepmessages, clearly."
07-05-2018T04:04:42,NickTheName,Or he sleepwalks  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
07-05-2018T04:05:43,NickTheName,His whole Internet existence is just a sleepwalking
07-05-2018T04:06:05,Xexanoth,he just made a bot that randomly responds with sleeping emojis when peole are active in chat

07-05-2018T09:53:27,Xexanoth,wait did picarto just update their style?
07-05-2018T09:54:25,NickTheName,YESS!
07-05-2018T09:54:58,NickTheName,20 -30 mins ago
07-05-2018T10:36:05,ItsActuallyKopyKat,hello!
07-05-2018T10:36:20,SiliconCarbide,hey there
07-05-2018T10:36:32,SiliconCarbide,woah this looks strange
07-05-2018T10:36:42,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Yeah, picarto just updated their stuff"
07-05-2018T11:27:33,MalinSharpPaw,"And Patreon changed as well, also strange"
07-05-2018T11:28:40,SiliconCarbide,patreon looks the same to me
07-05-2018T11:38:20,TorqueEmUp,"It broke Tom's offline pic. Now just generic ""stream offline"""
07-05-2018T11:43:46,TorqueEmUp,"and yeah, Patreon is unchanged."
07-05-2018T12:09:32,TheBeckoner,huh this is weird
07-05-2018T12:09:40,TheBeckoner,I wish the text was white still
07-05-2018T12:11:24,TheBeckoner,I bet money Bgr doesnt like this style.
07-05-2018T13:08:13,SiliconCarbide,why bgr specifically?
07-05-2018T13:58:05,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, this light grey, on grey background is annoying"
07-05-2018T14:24:10,zolstarym,"Having the last chat message blocked by the ""characters left"" line is annoying."
07-05-2018T14:24:45,zolstarym,The past broadcasts popup in the upper left is also annoying. It keeps coming up and going away constantly
07-05-2018T14:27:42,BadFoMo,@zolstarym I could say the same thing. Mostly for the last one if it happens during a stream.
07-05-2018T15:04:17,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: gmornin
07-05-2018T15:21:54,Bgrmystr2,Haven't refreshed the webpage so it's still the same as before
07-05-2018T15:55:55,totallynotTrace,so I was gone for the weakend. When did they do this UI refresh?
07-05-2018T15:57:40,Bgrmystr2,"Last night sometime, likely"
07-05-2018T15:57:52,Bgrmystr2,or this morning
07-05-2018T15:57:57,Bgrmystr2,I refreshed the page before sleeping
07-05-2018T15:59:02,Bgrmystr2,I'd say... within the past 10 hours
07-05-2018T15:59:43,totallynotTrace,cool
07-05-2018T18:10:39,Vatruvius,Hey everyone! Just thought of a cool sketch suggestion while driving back home. I look forward to suggesting it after I get my other suggestions sketched.
07-05-2018T18:21:14,Dadrobit,"Whoa, this is different"
07-05-2018T18:22:04,Dadrobit,I wonder if they changed it so that ™ works
07-05-2018T18:22:06,Dadrobit,nope
07-05-2018T18:22:44,Dadrobit,Gotta go with ᵀᴹ  still
07-05-2018T18:31:09,Combak,... So Picarto did a makeover again.
07-05-2018T18:31:27,Bgrmystr2,"Hasn't changed for me, don't wanna refresh."
07-05-2018T18:31:30,Bgrmystr2,:v
07-05-2018T18:31:36,Combak,Lucky you.
07-05-2018T18:31:47,Bgrmystr2,ehh not really :ptv-wondering:
07-05-2018T18:31:58,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I just reset the window and left it open"
07-05-2018T18:31:59,Bgrmystr2,as usual
07-05-2018T18:32:04,Bgrmystr2,before goin to sleep
07-05-2018T18:36:36,Vatruvius,Ohh...it is new. I like it.
07-05-2018T18:37:13,Combak,I don't.
07-05-2018T18:37:44,Vatruvius,Any particular reason why not?
07-05-2018T18:38:01,Combak,"The character count is a little annoying, the difference in color between text and background is fairly low, and Tom's offline image is borked."
07-05-2018T18:38:26,Combak,"... Plus, I'm pretty sure they made the header larger."
07-05-2018T18:39:21,Vatruvius,"The character counter does cover up the messages a little, but I think it is better than way up top. Easier to know when you are getting close to the max."
07-05-2018T18:39:44,Vatruvius,The offline image is broken it would seem.
07-05-2018T18:42:06,unsteddyphoenix,Grey on grey hmmmmmm
07-05-2018T18:42:15,Dadrobit,"Don't like how it keeps on popping up the ""watch previous videos"" window."
07-05-2018T18:42:22,Vatruvius,"The grey text is sort of nice, better for night time but they could go with a brighter grey."
07-05-2018T18:42:32,Vatruvius,With you there Dadro.
07-05-2018T18:42:53,Bgrmystr2,someone w/ a screenshot of the new look? So I don't gotta refresh and lose the old one? :U
07-05-2018T18:43:12,Vatruvius,"Ignoring it makes it disappear after six seconds, but it shouldn't do that. Once is enough if at all."
07-05-2018T18:43:20,Vatruvius,lol
07-05-2018T18:43:41,Vatruvius,Why not refresh Bgr? You are going to have to eventually.
07-05-2018T18:44:09,Vatruvius,One thing that is bugging me about the character counter is after you are done typing and it disappears it makes the chat jerk.
07-05-2018T18:44:13,Vatruvius,That is annoying.
07-05-2018T18:48:22,Combak,Exactly!
07-05-2018T18:50:15,Vatruvius,The character counter and chat should be separate and the counter should be slightly transparent so chat can show behind it.
07-05-2018T18:52:30,Dadrobit,"And the counter pops up every time you tab into picarto, even if the chat isn't selected."
07-05-2018T18:52:58,Vatruvius,Yup.
07-05-2018T18:53:10,Vatruvius,The counter could use some work.
07-05-2018T18:56:07,Combak,Plus they moved all the channel info stuff to the top of the screen and merged the line with the chat setting line. It uses more space now...
07-05-2018T18:56:16,Combak,And the heading stuff just seems larger now.
07-05-2018T18:57:56,Vatruvius,And they moved the banner. It use to be right under the stream window if I remember correctly. The stuff on the top does not bother me that much though.
07-05-2018T18:58:15,Combak,"Hey Bgr, give use a screenshot of the old version and I'll give you one of the new one."
07-05-2018T18:58:34,Combak,@bgrmystr2
07-05-2018T19:09:31,BadFoMo,I can get a picture of the old page. Should I upload it to DA?
07-05-2018T19:12:23,Bgrmystr2,"Well, you can just screenshot it, send it to a discord chat, and send the link it creates. Like this. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/250139544517607424/443565684362838036/firefox_2018-05-08_19-11-29.png"

07-05-2018T19:17:16,Vatruvius,Uhh...what did I do?
07-05-2018T19:17:25,CrRAR,"Also, the recording videos tab seems like it's possessed."
07-05-2018T19:17:35,Vatruvius,Well shit.
07-05-2018T19:17:45,CrRAR,It keeps popping up seemingly to remind me it's there.
07-05-2018T19:18:18,Vatruvius,"Awsome, so changing the chat style will erase all messages, FYI."
07-05-2018T19:18:42,CrRAR,Good bye cruel world!!!
07-05-2018T19:19:15,CrRAR,What is this simple mode?

07-05-2018T19:19:27,CrRAR,Is it any different?
07-05-2018T19:19:38,Bgrmystr2,Sounds like picarto has some seriously problematic changes
07-05-2018T19:19:41,Bgrmystr2,Do not want
07-05-2018T19:22:43,Bgrmystr2,"The one I still have now also has Standard, Simple, and Bubble"
07-05-2018T19:22:50,Bgrmystr2,for the chat style
07-05-2018T19:23:09,Bgrmystr2,"I recall not liking the other two, but that was a while back when they first implemented it"
07-05-2018T19:23:16,CrRAR,Simple seems just to have the chat text inline
07-05-2018T19:23:23,CrRAR,So it does save a little space
07-05-2018T19:23:38,Bgrmystr2,"dunno if they changed it since then, and even moreso I'm afraid it'll update the chat to the new one if I switch it now"
07-05-2018T19:23:39,CrRAR,"Bubble is probably the complete opposite,"
07-05-2018T19:23:55,Bgrmystr2,I like standard I guess
07-05-2018T19:24:09,CrRAR,Yeah
07-05-2018T19:29:40,Ordithus,"Woah, who changed the everything"
07-05-2018T19:30:40,Vatruvius,lol
07-05-2018T19:30:54,Vatruvius,"Welcome to the ""new"" and ""improved"" Picarto!"
07-05-2018T19:31:25,Ordithus,Yay \o/
07-05-2018T19:32:28,Bgrmystr2,"Don't think it's a ""yay"" but thankfully I haven't been subject to the new design yet"
07-05-2018T19:32:34,Bgrmystr2,dunno what it looks like still.
07-05-2018T19:34:05,zolstarym,you can open it up in a new tab without reloading current one
07-05-2018T19:34:19,Dadrobit,testing bubble
07-05-2018T19:34:31,Dadrobit,"ew, back to standard"
07-05-2018T19:34:35,Ordithus,lol
07-05-2018T19:35:22,Bgrmystr2,"The problem with that, Zol, is once I do that, it automatically updates my cache to the new one. Things on the one I have now tend to stop working"
07-05-2018T19:35:30,Bgrmystr2,tis  what happened the last two times picarto updated.
07-05-2018T19:35:49,Ordithus,Join us~
07-05-2018T19:35:53,Bgrmystr2,no
07-05-2018T19:35:57,Ordithus,Aw
07-05-2018T19:35:58,zolstarym,in a different browser then?
07-05-2018T19:36:13,Bgrmystr2,Don't have one of those :u
07-05-2018T19:36:30,zolstarym,come on and reload... The constant old stream recordings popup wants you to
07-05-2018T19:36:36,Vatruvius,"Join us, join us, join us!"
07-05-2018T19:36:44,Bgrmystr2,"I'll pass, thanks :ptv-confused:"
07-05-2018T19:36:44,Ordithus,One of us one of us one of us
07-05-2018T19:37:28,Vatruvius,"Besides the friendly reminder that Tom has videos and the jerky character counter, it looks really nice."
07-05-2018T19:37:43,zolstarym,I've sent an email to picarto asking to turn that off.
07-05-2018T19:37:46,Vatruvius,I am curious as to how it will hand multistreams. I guess I will find out Friday.
07-05-2018T19:38:01,Vatruvius,handle*
07-05-2018T19:42:06,Bgrmystr2,I'm not expecting my browser to survive all the way until friday
07-05-2018T19:42:16,Bgrmystr2,"I'm going to have to close it eventually, reset the ram usage on it"
07-05-2018T19:42:51,Bgrmystr2,it's not bad atm
07-05-2018T19:43:58,NightMeaty22,Hello

07-05-2018T19:51:36,Vatruvius,People do not like change. I for one like the update save for two things.
07-05-2018T19:52:12,NightMeaty22,Im fine with every thing but the chat dont work right

07-05-2018T19:53:11,Vatruvius,"Ohh, the app has always had inherent issues."
07-05-2018T19:53:25,NightMeaty22,It no longer works on chrome for me
07-05-2018T19:53:27,Vatruvius,So far it just looks slightly different.
07-05-2018T19:53:58,NightMeaty22,It wont let me type in the chat
07-05-2018T19:54:40,NightMeaty22,:ptv-sad:
07-05-2018T19:57:33,Combak,@bgrmystr2 here's what it looks like now. https://i.imgur.com/7fERt70.png

07-05-2018T20:02:51,NightMeaty22,But...i cant watch streams
07-05-2018T20:03:04,Ordithus,Hmm multistreams are a bit different.
07-05-2018T20:03:39,NightMeaty22,Just chat room

07-05-2018T20:14:31,Vatruvius,When you queue up for an online match and are paired with nothing but idiots...
07-05-2018T20:14:42,NightMeaty22,Oof
07-05-2018T20:15:00,Vatruvius,I am good but not 1v5 good.

07-05-2018T20:22:32,BadFoMo,"Oh, they're gone."
07-05-2018T20:42:26,Vatruvius,Did Tom ever do that second sketch stream?
07-05-2018T20:46:50,Bgrmystr2,"He did yardwork on Monday, and I don't know if his hand was up for drawing when he came back"
07-05-2018T20:47:08,Bgrmystr2,He went to sleep and haven't seen him poke his head in since
07-05-2018T20:47:33,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, he might have read the chat or whatever, but he hasn't said anything that I've seen"
07-05-2018T21:14:09,Vatruvius,I see. I recently weed waked my yard and my arms and legs hurt like hell afterward.
07-05-2018T21:21:49,Bgrmystr2,are the weeds awake now?
07-05-2018T21:22:27,Bgrmystr2,"a bit late, I think, but I guess your weeds are nocturnal..? :thinking:"
07-05-2018T21:39:07,Vatruvius,Awake?
07-05-2018T21:39:16,Vatruvius,"Dead, for sure."
07-05-2018T21:45:04,Bgrmystr2,I dunno. You're the one who said you 'waked' the weeds. I figure they just needed to wake up :v
07-05-2018T21:57:34,Vatruvius,weedwack
07-05-2018T22:00:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"With the day he described yesterday, I wouldn’t be shocked if he slept all day like I nearly did"
07-05-2018T22:01:50,SpazztasticKiwi,"Went to sleep almost 5 a.m. my time, woke up 4:30ish pm"
07-05-2018T22:03:50,Bgrmystr2,"ooh, you're wacking weeds, not waking them up. Shoulda said so! :V"
07-05-2018T22:08:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Gotta snack those weeds to death. How dare they take up space in your garden
07-05-2018T22:08:55,Bgrmystr2,yeah! Snack em good! They're probably hungry after growing all day..
07-05-2018T22:08:58,Bgrmystr2,:D
07-05-2018T22:10:06,SpazztasticKiwi,They’ve been eating all the nice plants’ food! 😱
07-05-2018T22:10:18,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s why we gotta kill em
07-05-2018T22:10:19,NightMeaty22,Chat work now? Maby?
07-05-2018T22:10:21,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock: how terrible!
