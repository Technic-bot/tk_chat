09-09-2018T00:47:57,unsteddyphoenix,It's a pretty funny contrast between *[very detailed outfit] and zentani shapes
09-09-2018T00:48:20,unsteddyphoenix,The effort was where it needed to be cant ask more than that~
09-09-2018T00:49:36,unsteddyphoenix,Did you use a ref for the outfit?

09-09-2018T01:01:56,Dadrobit,I'm not even sure what I'd want to continue with after this one gets done tbh.
09-09-2018T01:02:28,unsteddyphoenix,You mean you DONT have a notepad of random ideas?
09-09-2018T01:02:33,unsteddyphoenix,Weird
09-09-2018T01:02:59,SpazztasticKiwi,My random ideas are cute. I know ones in the queue for Halloween

09-09-2018T01:06:33,Dadrobit,I'l just get a cup of cheerios or something.
09-09-2018T01:07:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I don‚Äôt need weed to get the munchies
09-09-2018T01:08:19,Dadrobit,I honestly don't smoke a whole lot. Stuff can screw with my asthma.

09-09-2018T01:15:39,SpazztasticKiwi,I feel I must mention weed is not legal in my state
09-09-2018T01:18:43,Dadrobit,"You have my condolences. Technically, it's not all that legal here either. Need to have a green card."
09-09-2018T01:20:50,Dadrobit,"Oh, and unsteddy, very little chance of that happening. I keep a very very small stash at home at any given time. Easier to keep hidden from the nieces and nephews when they have a sleepover at my place."

09-09-2018T16:09:09,ThingsAreMoving,they felt the burn of hellfire :fire:
09-09-2018T16:09:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Or the burn of a very done teenager
09-09-2018T16:10:27,CrimsonQuill,"My sister was in an internet game with natural disasters, and silenced the whole chat by saying, out of the blue, 'I like Cheese' when everyone was talking about tornadoes coming their way."
09-09-2018T16:10:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve also learned my old youth pastor has applied to work in my department at Walmart
09-09-2018T16:10:40,CrimsonQuill,For 5 minutses.
09-09-2018T16:11:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Shock value is value
09-09-2018T16:11:28,ThingsAreMoving,Well how do you even respond to that
09-09-2018T16:11:35,CrimsonQuill,With shock
09-09-2018T16:11:37,CrimsonQuill,And crackers.
09-09-2018T16:11:42,CrimsonQuill,Cheese needs crackers
09-09-2018T16:12:02,ThingsAreMoving,depends on a type of cheese
09-09-2018T16:12:34,CrimsonQuill,"Cheddar, Edam, Gouda, Emmental, or Shropshire blue."
09-09-2018T16:12:43,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôll be back for lunch
09-09-2018T16:12:47,CrimsonQuill,Though the latter has some kick to it.
09-09-2018T16:12:59,CrimsonQuill,"Well, goodnight to you all."
09-09-2018T16:13:01,ThingsAreMoving,sounds like a good combination for fondue
09-09-2018T16:13:04,ThingsAreMoving,o/
09-09-2018T16:13:24,ThingsAreMoving,Imma go back to lurking
09-09-2018T16:16:41,KittyLoveless,fondue sounds nice

09-09-2018T18:58:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom been busy
09-09-2018T19:01:47,Dadrobit,"Mmmmm, and Neon just uploaded a new mix that's pretty swag as well. Good times."
09-09-2018T19:06:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I dunno what I want for lunch. I‚Äôm still slightly annoyed from the new guy
09-09-2018T19:08:31,SpazztasticKiwi,A biscuit
09-09-2018T19:12:41,Twokinds,and gravy
09-09-2018T19:17:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Those aren‚Äôt sold after 10:30
09-09-2018T19:22:04,Dadrobit,I thought you were calling the new guy a biscuit there for a second.
09-09-2018T19:22:55,Bgrmystr2,"probably is, to be honest."
09-09-2018T19:24:13,CommanderTrace,do you know this song Tom ? https://youtu.be/hUVq-aq6aVI
09-09-2018T19:26:57,SpazztasticKiwi,He‚Äôs not a biscuit. Whatever that means. But he did make me mad today
09-09-2018T19:27:05,SpazztasticKiwi,And that was a good biscuit
09-09-2018T19:34:24,Dadrobit,Like..... A Soggy Biscuit...
09-09-2018T19:34:26,Twokinds,Not really feelin it
09-09-2018T19:34:52,Dadrobit,Old school insult
09-09-2018T19:39:27,SpazztasticKiwi,That doesn‚Äôt seem like much of an insult to me
09-09-2018T19:39:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Is it like ‚Äúwet blanket‚Äù?
09-09-2018T19:40:14,Dadrobit,Hahahahahahaha! No.
09-09-2018T19:40:33,Dadrobit,Urban Dictionary it
09-09-2018T19:42:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I hate you for making me read that with my own two eyes
09-09-2018T19:42:56,Dadrobit,lmfao
09-09-2018T19:43:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Though the guys at my school had some weird ass games too
09-09-2018T19:43:56,Dadrobit,That one was probably one of the most used insults among myself and my siblings when we were wee kids. Up there with gaylord and fartknocker.
09-09-2018T19:44:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Sometimes I wish I had a brother and other times I‚Äôm happy I don‚Äôt
09-09-2018T19:44:50,Dadrobit,I feel like I should call my sister up and call her a soggy biscuit. Just for old time's sake.
09-09-2018T19:45:47,Dadrobit,Siblings are the best unless they aren't.
09-09-2018T20:01:14,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:
09-09-2018T20:05:53,Dadrobit,Zen is fine.
09-09-2018T20:11:34,Ordithus,"Holy crap, robit.  That's a nasty one.  Though, my sister did call me a shithead in French..."
09-09-2018T20:12:48,Dadrobit,"Yeah, but I love my siblings anyways. We had a good time."
09-09-2018T20:14:39,Ordithus,"Same.  My brother, sister, and I were pretty spread out but get along great."
09-09-2018T20:37:36,CrRAR,"come for the unconditional love, STAY for the stockholm syndrome~"
09-09-2018T22:18:26,SpazztasticKiwi,That sums it up pretty well
09-09-2018T22:19:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I know my dad‚Äôs two sisters call each other heifer
09-09-2018T22:52:01,unsteddyphoenix,My sister and I get along alright
09-09-2018T22:52:09,unsteddyphoenix,Which seems to shock pretty much everyone I know weirdly
09-09-2018T22:52:36,unsteddyphoenix,"Theyre all ""Wait you TALK to your SIBLINGS? You dont just ignore them as much as possible? thats crazy"""
09-09-2018T22:53:30,Bgrmystr2,Wish I could talk to my sister. :u
09-09-2018T22:54:45,unsteddyphoenix,Side note; Mary's so brutal I almost expect patreon to flag it as NSFW
09-09-2018T22:54:54,Bgrmystr2,xD right
09-09-2018T22:58:46,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúAngry lady too angry for sensitive eyes‚Äù
09-09-2018T23:24:29,Dadrobit,The trick is to only talk to your siblings on occasion.
09-09-2018T23:24:44,Dadrobit,Distance makes the heart grow fonder and all that.
09-09-2018T23:25:11,Dadrobit,So I alternate my weeks with different siblings.
09-09-2018T23:25:36,Dadrobit,Throwing in the parents and grandparents at odd intervals inbetween
09-09-2018T23:27:08,unsteddyphoenix,You got a cheeky excel spread to keep track of that or?
09-09-2018T23:30:16,Dadrobit,"Nah, usually they just call me up for babysitting favors, Or I go over to one or another to play with their dogs or play some MtG every once in a blue moon"
09-09-2018T23:30:42,Dadrobit,Usually I go over to play with the dogs and just end up getting roped into MtG
09-09-2018T23:32:32,unsteddyphoenix,Touch some dogs in exchange for card game favours seems fair
09-09-2018T23:34:00,Dadrobit,"One of my sisters rescues pitbulls, so many snuggles are had as she constantly has around 3-4 in the house."
09-09-2018T23:36:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve called my sister like twice since I‚Äôve had my phone. We generally text
09-09-2018T23:38:34,SpazztasticKiwi,And it‚Äôs either ‚Äúdinner in fridge‚Äù stuff or ‚Äúlook at this‚Äù stuff
09-09-2018T23:40:28,unsteddyphoenix,No flame but pitbulls are unpleasant
09-09-2018T23:40:51,Bgrmystr2,rly? why so?
09-09-2018T23:41:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Ours doesn‚Äôt understand that 80 pounds is not a lap dog
09-09-2018T23:41:31,Bgrmystr2,"prolly doesn't even know what a lapdog is, kiwi"
09-09-2018T23:41:49,Dadrobit,:( I love me some pibbles
09-09-2018T23:42:02,Dadrobit,Just big happy lapdogs
09-09-2018T23:42:10,unsteddyphoenix,Theyre groooss~
09-09-2018T23:42:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Or that it‚Äôs not tradition to jump into a visitor‚Äôs lap to say hi all the time
09-09-2018T23:42:32,SpazztasticKiwi,RIP male visitors laps btw
09-09-2018T23:42:55,unsteddyphoenix,Some dog breeds are just ugly to be honest
09-09-2018T23:43:23,Dadrobit,D:
09-09-2018T23:43:39,unsteddyphoenix,Tell me im wrong though
09-09-2018T23:43:55,Dadrobit,"I mean, I understand chihuahua's are ugly little fuckers, but pibbles???"
09-09-2018T23:44:28,unsteddyphoenix,Chihuahuas are on a whole other level to be fair
09-09-2018T23:44:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Chihuahuas are sorta mean little sacks of spite to me
09-09-2018T23:44:36,Bgrmystr2,"Are they though, dadro? I'd think the opposite, but not to the scale of ugly"
09-09-2018T23:44:50,Bgrmystr2,pitbulls just look like their face was melted.
09-09-2018T23:44:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Wrinkles
09-09-2018T23:45:07,Bgrmystr2,I mean..

09-09-2018T23:45:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Not like the Sharpei

09-09-2018T23:47:13,Bgrmystr2,I've seen some fairly droop-ass faces though
09-09-2018T23:47:15,unsteddyphoenix,Thats the best of a bad situation
09-09-2018T23:48:22,Dadrobit,Pibble is sad doggo that you would accuse it of being ugly https://i.imgur.com/Uz2jeHh.jpg
09-09-2018T23:49:10,Dadrobit,"Also, it has suddenly occurred to me that I am unbelievably lacking in the picture department of my sister's dogs."

09-09-2018T23:57:34,Dadrobit,Pitbull terriers are the ones that I think of when I think of pitbull.
09-09-2018T23:57:43,Dadrobit,German Shepards are popular police dogs
