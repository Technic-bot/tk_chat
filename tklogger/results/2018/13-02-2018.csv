13-02-2018T00:00:28,Twokinds,It's way easier to get away with transitions online since it's 1 page at a time
13-02-2018T00:00:55,unsteddyphoenix,That makes a lot of sense
13-02-2018T00:01:07,unsteddyphoenix,Have you shuffled the orders in previous books too?
13-02-2018T00:01:45,Twokinds,"Yes, a lot"
13-02-2018T00:03:05,Twokinds,"One thing I try very hard to make sure, is that when there's something dramatic happening, it happens after a pageturn."
13-02-2018T00:03:33,Twokinds,"So it's like ""And then suddenly!"" and then you have to turn the page to see Adelaide appear in the courtroom, or the tower blow up, etc"
13-02-2018T00:04:07,unsteddyphoenix,Right...otherwise you'd see the reveal on the second page while looking at the first.
13-02-2018T00:04:23,Twokinds,Exactly
13-02-2018T00:04:42,unsteddyphoenix,It makes so much sense I feel like I shouldve already known this.
13-02-2018T00:04:55,Twokinds,"Or like if there's a flashback, I like to have it start on the left page. So that both left and right pages are black bordered."
13-02-2018T00:06:04,Twokinds,"Luckily, since a lot of stuff is going on at once, usually, and there's just one-off pages with Mike and Evals or whatever, it's very easy to just shift one page without changing the order of events."
13-02-2018T00:06:17,Twokinds,And I only do that if absolutely necessary for a dramatic reveal or whatever.
13-02-2018T00:07:11,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, it would be harder if Mike and Evals was connected to the main plotline at that point somehow."
13-02-2018T00:07:18,unsteddyphoenix,'Cause then it matters what time they do what
13-02-2018T00:07:46,Twokinds,"Yeah, obviously I can't shift the page where they spot the tower exploding"
13-02-2018T00:08:07,Twokinds,"I probably put more thought into it than I should, but this is why the books take so long."
13-02-2018T00:08:26,unsteddyphoenix,"Lol, right, the time they do things matter at that point"
13-02-2018T00:08:38,unsteddyphoenix,"Actually, now that you've explained it it makes sense why you're thinking about this"
13-02-2018T00:09:20,unsteddyphoenix,I could definitely see it changing how it's read
13-02-2018T00:09:23,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: I dunno tom. I think you're probably putting exactly the amount of effort you should into it. This is why books end up being good reads. Cuz people like you actually spend time and effort trying to make things read so smoothly.
13-02-2018T00:09:31,unsteddyphoenix,Though most people wouldnt consciously notice it
13-02-2018T00:09:35,NightMeaty22,Hi
13-02-2018T00:10:06,unsteddyphoenix,heylo
13-02-2018T00:10:38,NightMeaty22,Hi unsteddy how are you¿
13-02-2018T00:10:39,unsteddyphoenix,"Still, if you're at the stage where you're moving panels around you must be fairly close to finishing, right?"
13-02-2018T00:11:54,Twokinds,"When you do things right, people will think I am a god. I think that's how the saying goes."
13-02-2018T00:12:17,unsteddyphoenix,CLOSE.
13-02-2018T00:12:19,TheBeckoner,Lol.
13-02-2018T00:12:33,TheBeckoner,I thought you were a big green slug lady??
13-02-2018T00:12:44,Twokinds,"Yeah, I'm very close to being done."
13-02-2018T00:13:02,Twokinds,I am just going over the book for any obvious mistakes before handing it off to my proofreaders
13-02-2018T00:13:42,unsteddyphoenix,"Nice, congrats!"
13-02-2018T00:14:02,TheBeckoner,Are they like on staff proofreaders? Or are they like pay per use sorta deals?
13-02-2018T00:14:13,NightMeaty22,👍

13-02-2018T00:16:09,unsteddyphoenix,Unfair
13-02-2018T00:16:25,Twokinds,"Uh, it's like Sage, and stuff"
13-02-2018T00:16:35,Twokinds,Mostly Sage.
13-02-2018T00:16:45,Twokinds,Also amenon.

13-02-2018T00:17:03,TheBeckoner,Yeah I forgot to consider when your other friends are writers they are free work basically lol
13-02-2018T00:17:12,unsteddyphoenix,See that makes sense~
13-02-2018T00:18:06,TheBeckoner,"I am currently writing a speech, Night."
13-02-2018T00:18:39,NightMeaty22,Good luck
13-02-2018T00:18:53,unsteddyphoenix,If you do need another one I could volunteer. I can satisfactorily pick out errors in writing as long as it's not my own~ :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
13-02-2018T00:19:14,unsteddyphoenix,"Oof, hated speeches though."
13-02-2018T00:19:27,NightMeaty22,I suck a writing
13-02-2018T00:20:08,MidnightBlue78,"i wish my first language were english, i would help too"
13-02-2018T00:20:39,TheBeckoner,I guess I have scored well in writing. I havent written much on my own time though.
13-02-2018T00:20:40,NightMeaty22,I would help if i was not dyslexic
13-02-2018T00:20:44,Twokinds,If you'd like to help you can.
13-02-2018T00:20:51,unsteddyphoenix,Your english is pretty good though midnight.
13-02-2018T00:20:51,TheBeckoner,And yes I hate speeches.
13-02-2018T00:21:28,unsteddyphoenix,"Sure, just send me the pages or however you do it. :)"
13-02-2018T00:21:29,TheBeckoner,"Yeah, it is Midnight. I would've never thought it wasn't your first language."
13-02-2018T00:21:32,unsteddyphoenix,I have the time right now.
13-02-2018T00:21:43,BluePhantom90,aww. would like to help too lol.

13-02-2018T00:22:46,Twokinds,"Uh, I don't have the pdf ready yet"
13-02-2018T00:22:50,Twokinds,How about tomorrow?
13-02-2018T00:23:47,NightMeaty22,Btw how are you tom¿
13-02-2018T00:24:05,TheBeckoner,I think it would be neat to read over them as well. Although I totally understand if its too many people.
13-02-2018T00:24:19,Twokinds,I'm great!
13-02-2018T00:24:26,iliar,Good morning
13-02-2018T00:24:31,NightMeaty22,👍🙃
13-02-2018T00:24:34,iliar,"About printed copy. When you open a comic, you see two pages. And really cool when both of these pages are in a single color scheme."
13-02-2018T00:24:44,NightMeaty22,Morning¿
13-02-2018T00:24:44,iliar,There is one thing that I really like in TDM. But perhaps this is difficult to do with the main comic.
13-02-2018T00:24:59,Twokinds,Yeah I didn't exactly plan out the comics for print back then
13-02-2018T00:25:07,Twokinds,"Er, well, not formatting wise."
13-02-2018T00:25:34,BluePhantom90,btw Tom got those e-mails of mine? &gt;-&lt; sorry I sent 3 I tried to do 1 but got distracted.
13-02-2018T00:25:46,Twokinds,"Yes, I got them"
13-02-2018T00:26:30,BluePhantom90,yeah sorry for sending 3
13-02-2018T00:26:52,Twokinds,You'd better be D:&lt;

13-02-2018T00:27:47,BluePhantom90,"&gt;.&lt; I know, I got too distracted with three other streams and watching youtube vids"
13-02-2018T00:27:53,Twokinds,You know what's weird to think about? Book 4 starts in 2008. And 2008 is when I was redoing the first pages in color for Book 1.
13-02-2018T00:28:30,Twokinds,"So in 2008 I was thinking about how much of an idiot I was in 2003 and redoing that work, and now I'm here thinking how much of an idiot I was in 2008, redoing his work."
13-02-2018T00:28:31,BluePhantom90,yeah it is weird
13-02-2018T00:28:56,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah tomorrow is good
13-02-2018T00:29:12,Twokinds,"Then like in 2022, I'm gunna be thinking ""man 2018 Tom was an idiot"" and redoing his work."
13-02-2018T00:29:30,unsteddyphoenix,Will the cycle ever end~
13-02-2018T00:30:22,Twokinds,"In 2114, when I become a perfect, immortal machine."

13-02-2018T00:32:49,unsteddyphoenix,Thats ridiculous
13-02-2018T00:32:55,unsteddyphoenix,Tentacle monsters cant draw
13-02-2018T00:33:04,unsteddyphoenix,Its a well known fact
13-02-2018T00:33:15,unsteddyphoenix,And they probably cant even WORK a computer!
13-02-2018T00:33:35,TheBeckoner,Nah they draw super good. Haven't you seen their dexterity in hen- uhh art?
13-02-2018T00:33:52,TheBeckoner,plus all those arms
13-02-2018T00:33:59,TheBeckoner,gotta do something right?
13-02-2018T00:34:03,MidnightBlue78,But what if its a shape shifting tentacle monster with computer knowledge?
13-02-2018T00:34:12,TheBeckoner,^
13-02-2018T00:34:27,unsteddyphoenix,Pretty sure that's what Sage is actually.
13-02-2018T00:34:55,TheBeckoner,huh I swear that was Tom... and he could like sample anyone's powers as well?
13-02-2018T00:35:21,BluePhantom90,"Wonder Tom. I still have my sites on one sketch idea. But would you do one with ""Flora sits between Adira and Adelaide hearing the horrors of going into labor"" Thought it would be too graphic?"
13-02-2018T00:35:30,TheBeckoner,and like teleport really big stuff or something? Memory like mine is pretty fuzzy.
13-02-2018T00:36:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Greetings from the magical world of YouTube

13-02-2018T00:38:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I thought he didn’t jump because he likes to sit and work all day

13-02-2018T00:45:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll probably get a box of chocolates and one of those little flowers
13-02-2018T00:46:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Or some German beer cheese. That’s some good stuff

13-02-2018T00:48:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Did you know it takes approximately 15 pounds of beer cheese to get you drunk
13-02-2018T00:49:22,TheBeckoner,"Did you know 1 gallon of gasoline is equal to about 53,000 squirrels?"
13-02-2018T00:49:47,SpazztasticKiwi,How the hell did you figure that out
13-02-2018T00:49:52,unsteddyphoenix,Fuel efficiency?

13-02-2018T00:57:40,TheBeckoner,I mean none of those conversions are nice or exact in any way aside from the horsepower to watt conversion.
13-02-2018T00:58:01,TheBeckoner,It's just for fun really.
13-02-2018T00:58:11,TheBeckoner,And even that conversion isnt exact

13-02-2018T01:07:17,NightMeaty22,Cya
13-02-2018T01:07:45,iliar,Night.
13-02-2018T01:07:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"Each nib Tom posted can represent 4,818 squirrels; 53,000ish in total"
13-02-2018T01:08:13,SpazztasticKiwi,✌🏻
13-02-2018T01:10:34,TheBeckoner,"Ahhhh I apologize @iliar The original calculation I did was based off of a car going 1 mile at 60 miles per hour for one hour achieving 60mpg thereby using about 33,000 watts of power from that time and amount of gasoline. Then that 33kw was ultimately"
13-02-2018T01:10:39,TheBeckoner,taken to squirrel power.
13-02-2018T01:10:52,TheBeckoner,I forgot the time part lol
13-02-2018T01:10:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m gonna check my discord. Y’all have fun a minute
13-02-2018T01:10:55,TheBeckoner,My bad.
13-02-2018T01:13:49,TheBeckoner,oops I meant 60 miles for 1 hour
13-02-2018T01:14:21,TheBeckoner,"I think...It's too late for me to do any good math...all the values are there, just not in the right order lol"
13-02-2018T01:14:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Why exactly were you measuring this
13-02-2018T01:15:15,TheBeckoner,For my speech. I'm using it as a memorable thing.
13-02-2018T01:17:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I remember my speech class
13-02-2018T01:17:52,TheBeckoner,"Yes, I dislike it."
13-02-2018T01:19:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m happy I’m out and got able to choose my own courses
13-02-2018T01:19:35,TheBeckoner,Well I have like 2 years of stuff I gotta take. This is one of them.
13-02-2018T01:19:45,SpazztasticKiwi,And the other
13-02-2018T01:19:56,TheBeckoner,Other?
13-02-2018T01:20:27,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s another year of speech?
13-02-2018T01:21:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I only had to take one full course - the other was a short lesson in high school
13-02-2018T01:21:56,TheBeckoner,Well no. This is a single semester class and I think that's it for speech.
13-02-2018T01:22:22,Twokinds,Aaaaand done
13-02-2018T01:22:41,SpazztasticKiwi,What were you doin
13-02-2018T01:22:46,unsteddyphoenix,Woo
13-02-2018T01:22:48,TheBeckoner,Done with book 4?
13-02-2018T01:22:56,iliar,Congratulations!
13-02-2018T01:23:05,unsteddyphoenix,:tada::confetti_ball::tada::balloon::tada:
13-02-2018T01:23:32,TheBeckoner,notsurebut \^O^/
13-02-2018T01:23:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Ooo more stuff
13-02-2018T01:24:44,SpazztasticKiwi,✨🐯✨
13-02-2018T01:26:00,iliar,I don't know what exactly done. But it's always great when work is done.
13-02-2018T01:26:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"Now what? Bed, celebratory ice cream?"
13-02-2018T01:26:35,TheBeckoner,Celebratory bed?
13-02-2018T01:26:55,TheBeckoner,Oooh what about an ice cream bed?
13-02-2018T01:27:02,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds very cold
13-02-2018T01:27:11,SpazztasticKiwi,And sticky
13-02-2018T01:27:23,TheBeckoner,Well sure. You take turns sliding across it.
13-02-2018T01:27:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Take turns? Shouldn’t there only be one person
13-02-2018T01:28:14,TheBeckoner,Never.
13-02-2018T01:28:34,TheBeckoner,Ice cream beds are traditionally a multi-person deal.
13-02-2018T01:28:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Well I guess I’m missing out 😐
13-02-2018T01:28:44,unsteddyphoenix,In summary; relax in some way
13-02-2018T01:28:45,TheBeckoner,I'd say so.
13-02-2018T01:28:49,unsteddyphoenix,"Videogames, presumably."
13-02-2018T01:29:01,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s that too
13-02-2018T01:29:20,TheBeckoner,"They don't taste as good, but yeah."
13-02-2018T01:29:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I prefer watching games rather than playing them. Unless it’s Mario cart
13-02-2018T01:30:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Or just dance
13-02-2018T01:32:54,unsteddyphoenix,Or the Sims?
13-02-2018T01:36:20,SpazztasticKiwi,That too
13-02-2018T01:37:41,unsteddyphoenix,Female stereotype checks out~
13-02-2018T01:37:46,unsteddyphoenix,"No offense, of course."
13-02-2018T01:38:03,Bgrmystr2,xD
13-02-2018T01:38:21,Bgrmystr2,playing games stimulates the brain
13-02-2018T01:38:44,Bgrmystr2,better overall than just watching someone play them
13-02-2018T01:39:13,TheBeckoner,If you play the right ones they can also stimulate the pe-
13-02-2018T01:39:17,TheBeckoner,erson playing.
13-02-2018T01:39:27,TheBeckoner,yeah
13-02-2018T01:39:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Heroes never die
13-02-2018T01:41:55,TheBeckoner,Who's the hero?
13-02-2018T01:46:10,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s an Overwatch reference
13-02-2018T01:46:48,TheBeckoner,Oh.
13-02-2018T01:48:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m more of a D.Va. person myself
13-02-2018T01:49:23,unsteddyphoenix,I like you. You have good taste. :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
13-02-2018T01:49:37,unsteddyphoenix,tempted to get back into Overwatch purely for that new DVA skin
13-02-2018T01:49:50,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m a delight in person too
13-02-2018T01:50:07,unsteddyphoenix,https://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Overwatch-Dva-Black-Cat.jpg
13-02-2018T01:50:10,unsteddyphoenix,So cute~
13-02-2018T01:50:18,unsteddyphoenix,Oh im sure :)
13-02-2018T01:51:33,Bgrmystr2,"ehhh, that's cute?"
13-02-2018T01:52:21,TheBeckoner,eh not my style either.
13-02-2018T01:52:30,SpazztasticKiwi,I prefer her regular skin
13-02-2018T01:52:32,Bgrmystr2,I guess if you're into the gothic lolita-esque style
13-02-2018T01:52:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Gives her too much of a schoolgirl look for me
13-02-2018T01:53:10,Bgrmystr2,that's not even remotely schoolgirl lol
13-02-2018T01:53:14,SpazztasticKiwi,But she does look nice with pigtails
13-02-2018T01:53:22,TheBeckoner,Hey wanna see a dude jumpin on thumbtacks?
13-02-2018T01:53:27,Bgrmystr2,no xD
13-02-2018T01:53:30,Bgrmystr2,No I don't
13-02-2018T01:53:32,TheBeckoner,awww
13-02-2018T01:53:47,SpazztasticKiwi,What on earth for
13-02-2018T01:54:03,TheBeckoner,just coz
13-02-2018T01:54:41,Bgrmystr2,That outfit looks like every single stereotypical annoying rich gothloli know-it-all
13-02-2018T01:54:46,Bgrmystr2,:C
13-02-2018T01:54:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve seen grown men jump into tubs of eggnog. One disturbing experience is enough
13-02-2018T01:56:27,Bgrmystr2,"I can see the draw of it, but there's just too many examples of 'bitch' I've seen wearing outfits like that"
13-02-2018T01:56:29,Bgrmystr2,can't unsee
13-02-2018T01:56:31,Bgrmystr2,:/
13-02-2018T01:56:50,TheBeckoner,I don't like skirts or pigtails tbh.
13-02-2018T01:58:04,unsteddyphoenix,Screw you guys its cute :ctwokinds-flomad:
13-02-2018T01:58:10,Bgrmystr2,xD
13-02-2018T01:58:57,Bgrmystr2,"Hey, ain't knockin it, Phoenix. If you like it, it's totally cool. I've just seen too many shows where that outfit is ruined by the shitty personality wearing it."
13-02-2018T01:59:38,TheBeckoner,Honestly normal clothe are the thing I like lol
13-02-2018T01:59:58,TheBeckoner,clothes*
13-02-2018T02:00:41,TheBeckoner,I do appreciate badass general jackets and uniform though. Any sort of heavy non-mechanized armor as well.
13-02-2018T02:00:47,TheBeckoner,uniforms*
13-02-2018T02:04:16,Bgrmystr2,"Ehh, you're just kinda boring Beck lol"
13-02-2018T02:04:19,Bgrmystr2,:(
13-02-2018T02:04:26,Bgrmystr2,you like all that normie stuff
13-02-2018T02:04:45,TheBeckoner,Well hey
13-02-2018T02:04:50,TheBeckoner,thats just normal
13-02-2018T02:05:13,TheBeckoner,idk nothing special or weird really comes to mind attire wise.
13-02-2018T02:07:18,Bgrmystr2,you must be fun :/
13-02-2018T02:07:36,Bgrmystr2,"the weird stuff is good, yo"
13-02-2018T02:07:57,TheBeckoner,aye fuck off I am fun lol
13-02-2018T02:08:01,Bgrmystr2,it brings life to an otherwise dull everyday scenario
13-02-2018T02:08:14,Bgrmystr2,"hey, if all you like is normal stuff, whar's the fun in that? :V"
13-02-2018T02:08:49,TheBeckoner,Well we are just talkin about clothes. You should take a ride in my truck sometime.
13-02-2018T02:09:34,TheBeckoner,I don't do much in the way of clothes. I do however enjoy vehicles.
13-02-2018T02:09:50,TheBeckoner,"Or go karts, or anything I can make dangerous and fast"
13-02-2018T02:09:52,Bgrmystr2,I mean.. :ptv-wondering: okay. The old guy that lives here owns a Corvette and a classic rat rod
13-02-2018T02:10:05,TheBeckoner,Sounds like my kinda dude.
13-02-2018T02:10:09,Bgrmystr2,so it's not like I haven't seen wild cars
13-02-2018T02:10:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a pair of 3 inch hot pink glitter heels
13-02-2018T02:10:24,Bgrmystr2,"lol Beck, he's in his 60s"
13-02-2018T02:10:29,Bgrmystr2,:P
13-02-2018T02:10:34,TheBeckoner,I like old people Bgr.
13-02-2018T02:10:57,TheBeckoner,They have stories and knowledge.
13-02-2018T02:11:01,TheBeckoner,I like both
13-02-2018T02:11:13,Bgrmystr2,"he's nice on the outside, but you wouldn't wanna live with the guy"
13-02-2018T02:12:06,TheBeckoner,"No of course not. I appreciate their knowledge and cynical manor, however I wouldnt use older people as a model for social things."
13-02-2018T02:12:47,TheBeckoner,I guess I have a leather jacket?? That's pretty normal though.
13-02-2018T02:12:53,TheBeckoner,Uh
13-02-2018T02:12:55,TheBeckoner,Oh
13-02-2018T02:13:05,TheBeckoner,I do appreciate some nice shoes actually.
13-02-2018T02:13:34,TheBeckoner,That's about it
13-02-2018T02:13:49,Twokinds,"Final page count, book 4: 176"
13-02-2018T02:14:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Not bad
13-02-2018T02:14:08,Twokinds,Making it the longest tk book so far.
13-02-2018T02:14:19,TheBeckoner,Sounds like 176 pages.
13-02-2018T02:14:22,Bgrmystr2,nice
13-02-2018T02:14:32,Twokinds,"Every book ends up longer than the last, though."
13-02-2018T02:14:54,TheBeckoner,Means you're leaking more creativity everytime.
13-02-2018T02:15:02,SpazztasticKiwi,As the story goes on you find yourself thinking of more and more?
13-02-2018T02:15:18,TheBeckoner,Im still writing this damn speech...So tired.
13-02-2018T02:15:23,Twokinds,The chapters just get really long so it's harder to break it up easily
13-02-2018T02:15:46,unsteddyphoenix,better and better value :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:
13-02-2018T02:15:55,TheBeckoner,Longer chapters = fewer places to stop I guess?
13-02-2018T02:16:08,TheBeckoner,I guess you dont wanna not end on not a chapter.
13-02-2018T02:16:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m just fine with this
13-02-2018T02:16:25,TheBeckoner,That sentence read poorly...
13-02-2018T02:16:33,TheBeckoner,mine that is
13-02-2018T02:16:58,unsteddyphoenix,It didnt not.
13-02-2018T02:17:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"“English is my first language, I swear”"
13-02-2018T02:17:53,SpazztasticKiwi,It just doesn’t seem like it sone times
13-02-2018T02:18:19,TheBeckoner,Tired brain read bad.
13-02-2018T02:18:29,TheBeckoner,Good thing this first draft isnt graded...
13-02-2018T02:19:04,SpazztasticKiwi,What exactly are you trying to get across?
13-02-2018T02:19:31,TheBeckoner,The basic's of a 4-cycle piston engine.
13-02-2018T02:19:35,Twokinds,Vol 3 = 160 pages
13-02-2018T02:19:37,TheBeckoner,basics*
13-02-2018T02:19:51,Twokinds,Vol 4 = 176. 16 bonus pages.
13-02-2018T02:19:57,unsteddyphoenix,Ah so not a huge difference
13-02-2018T02:20:06,unsteddyphoenix,Bonus pages!?
13-02-2018T02:20:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Well beck can’t help you there
13-02-2018T02:20:45,TheBeckoner,Well I wouldnt expect most people here to.
13-02-2018T02:20:56,TheBeckoner,Thanks for the thought though.
13-02-2018T02:21:14,TheBeckoner,Maybe Marv or FD but they arent here
13-02-2018T02:21:45,SpazztasticKiwi,"And so what if you’re increasing at a small variable, Tom? It means you’re story’s growing"
13-02-2018T02:22:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"If I’ve been told one thing in English, it’s that each essay should be a bit longer than the last"
13-02-2018T02:23:52,TheBeckoner,"All of the professors I've had thus far have straight up said ""I wont grade it if its over X pages"""
13-02-2018T02:24:13,TheBeckoner,But If you aren't writing for a grade then probably.
13-02-2018T02:25:11,Bgrmystr2,"Yknow, to be fair Tom, your newer chapters on the TK archives are longer than the old ones as well"
13-02-2018T02:25:42,Bgrmystr2,"that shows a difference in storytelling, likely for the better"
13-02-2018T02:26:01,Bgrmystr2,it's not surprising it shows itself similarly in the books
13-02-2018T02:29:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"Now that you’ve got your flow, you’re running with it"
13-02-2018T02:34:21,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all!
13-02-2018T02:35:00,unsteddyphoenix,yo daddy
13-02-2018T02:47:51,TheBeckoner,Hey Robit.
13-02-2018T02:48:13,TheBeckoner,will perish soon after writing this stupid speech.
13-02-2018T02:49:39,Dadrobit,https://i.imgur.com/EZnwiV7.png
13-02-2018T02:49:44,Dadrobit,Let the editing commence
13-02-2018T02:49:55,Dadrobit,cracks knuckles
13-02-2018T02:50:16,unsteddyphoenix,dragons comp session?
13-02-2018T02:50:26,Dadrobit,The recording thing for Neon
13-02-2018T02:51:09,TheBeckoner,What are you doin to it?
13-02-2018T02:52:21,Dadrobit,"Just a narration. I recorded it a couple times a couple different ways, so now I have to comp it."
13-02-2018T02:52:39,unsteddyphoenix,are you voicing a dragon?
13-02-2018T02:53:01,Dadrobit,Basically take the best portions of each read and ake it sound like one continuous flawless read.
13-02-2018T02:53:05,Dadrobit,make*
13-02-2018T02:53:22,Dadrobit,Maybe?
13-02-2018T02:53:33,TheBeckoner,Sounds neat.
13-02-2018T02:53:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m just watching a video of a dude sitting in a tub of glass puddy
13-02-2018T02:54:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"When he tries to get out, it’s going to be like a full body wax all at the same time"
13-02-2018T02:54:46,Dadrobit,Then I'll send him the raws + my own vocoded edit for giggles.
13-02-2018T02:55:19,unsteddyphoenix,How long is this thing?
13-02-2018T02:55:20,TheBeckoner,yeah...give it to em raw.
13-02-2018T02:55:34,TheBeckoner,20mins~?
13-02-2018T02:55:56,Dadrobit,"Dunno, the track he gave me to work off of is just a clip."
13-02-2018T02:56:12,Dadrobit,My own portion is about a minute
13-02-2018T02:56:17,TheBeckoner,Whats the 19.9 value?
13-02-2018T02:56:37,unsteddyphoenix,"A minute? Damn, isnt this for a song?"
13-02-2018T02:56:52,Dadrobit,Time. 19.9 seconds in is where my cursor is selecting
13-02-2018T02:57:09,TheBeckoner,Ahh I thought that was minutes
13-02-2018T02:58:01,Dadrobit,It's not my usual fare certainly. Dunno how I'd even charge for something like this tbh.
13-02-2018T02:58:28,Dadrobit,I'd probably just default to a single session fee for short story narration.
13-02-2018T02:59:23,TheBeckoner,Charge him in helium. It's very valuable.
13-02-2018T02:59:34,TheBeckoner,Or will be
13-02-2018T02:59:42,Bgrmystr2,"interesting. You're not using Audacity. Is what you're using a better mixer, Dadro?"
13-02-2018T03:02:39,Dadrobit,Pro Tools is to Audacity what Photoshop is to Paint.exe
13-02-2018T03:05:36,Dadrobit,"Though Audacity works, if you're looking for a free/very inexpensive alternative that is considerably more robust, look up Reaper."
13-02-2018T03:05:54,Dadrobit,I used that until I could afford Pro Tools.
13-02-2018T03:06:10,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-wondering: Hm.
13-02-2018T03:06:17,Bgrmystr2,"Cool, I'll give it a look-up"
13-02-2018T03:06:44,Bgrmystr2,I don't know a lot about audio-recording programs like that
13-02-2018T03:07:02,Bgrmystr2,"a little on how they work, but ehh"
13-02-2018T03:07:53,Bgrmystr2,Reaper sounds more like a company that makes high quality subwoofers for vehicles or something
13-02-2018T03:07:55,Dadrobit,"Reaper is ""free"" in that it will prompt you to please buy it after a month or so, but you can just click a ""still evaluating"" button indefinitely."
13-02-2018T03:08:19,Bgrmystr2,so it's like WinRAR
13-02-2018T03:08:20,TheBeckoner,Like winrar
13-02-2018T03:08:22,TheBeckoner,lol
13-02-2018T03:08:30,Bgrmystr2,cool
13-02-2018T03:08:52,TheBeckoner,I think I'm done with my speech.
13-02-2018T03:08:53,Dadrobit,"$60 if you make less than $20k, or $225 for a full commercial liscense."
13-02-2018T03:09:18,TheBeckoner,The hard thing is i had to write two different ones on the same thing...
13-02-2018T03:09:38,Dadrobit,"Whereas Pro Tools is $25 a month with a yearly subscription, or $600 one-time with a year of support."
13-02-2018T03:09:52,Bgrmystr2,does reaper have options for like.. active audio transfer? Kind of like how Voicemeeter gives me virtual audio for multiple inputs and outputs?
13-02-2018T03:10:26,Bgrmystr2,or is it just for editing stuff
13-02-2018T03:11:00,TheBeckoner,Goodnight guys.
13-02-2018T03:11:11,Dadrobit,Like just passing it through the program to get it to a compressor and then straight back out into a stream or something like that?
13-02-2018T03:11:18,Dadrobit,Night Beck
13-02-2018T03:12:17,Bgrmystr2,well.. no I mean.. I'm using voicemeeter for the ability to put my computer audio and my mic audio as one source that I can use to stream online
13-02-2018T03:12:37,Bgrmystr2,and it also allows me to pick up to three separate audio outputs for my computer
13-02-2018T03:12:58,Bgrmystr2,so I have my stereo and two monitors all playing the same audio
13-02-2018T03:13:11,Bgrmystr2,Windows only allows one primary output
13-02-2018T03:13:19,Bgrmystr2,"there is no second or third output, it doesn't exist"
13-02-2018T03:13:40,Bgrmystr2,but voicemeeter lets me output to all of them at once
13-02-2018T03:13:48,Bgrmystr2,it's like a live mixer
13-02-2018T03:15:06,Bgrmystr2,"I was just wondering if Reaper had similar features or if it's strictly like Audacity, where I import songs and edit them, or record stuff actively into the program"
13-02-2018T03:15:28,Dadrobit,"I would wager yes, but I honestly don't know. Their forums are super helpful for asking about stuff like that, and their YouTube has about 350 different tutorials, so it might already be answered there."
13-02-2018T03:16:00,Dadrobit,"I mean, if you already have a program that works fine, then stick with it."
13-02-2018T03:17:02,Dadrobit,"Reaper has a ton of functionality, sure, but if you only want to use it for one thing, and you don't know how to make it do that thing, it will probably be more of a hassle than it's worth."
13-02-2018T03:17:05,Bgrmystr2,"yeh. I really like Voicemeeter's ability to have multiple audio inputs and outputs as a virtual mixer, but I don't know if there's a better one."
13-02-2018T03:17:33,Bgrmystr2,"Well, I'll give it a try and see how it works. :)"
13-02-2018T03:17:48,Bgrmystr2,thanks for the suggestion :ptv-greetings::thumbsup:
13-02-2018T03:18:19,Dadrobit,Good luck!

13-02-2018T20:40:04,Bgrmystr2,glad to know everyone else actually has rather meaningful mental stress
13-02-2018T20:40:06,Bgrmystr2,unlike me
13-02-2018T20:40:15,Dadrobit,5 pages is nothing. Maybe 30 minutes of writing? Hour tops if I have to do research

13-02-2018T22:36:03,Twokinds,I don't want it to be wireless.
13-02-2018T22:36:11,Twokinds,I'd love a wired verison or a built in one if I could get it.
13-02-2018T22:36:13,TheBeckoner,Plug it in then.
13-02-2018T22:36:16,Twokinds,But wacom is just awful.

13-02-2018T22:37:01,TheBeckoner,I was semi sarcastic and then you said there was a wired one so my sarcasm went out the window.
13-02-2018T22:37:22,unsteddyphoenix,Nah Dad thats the shirt misleading you I think
13-02-2018T22:37:30,Combak,... There's got to be a setting for that.
13-02-2018T22:37:35,TorqueEmUp,"also don't forget about her tail, goes between her legs, but comes out behind it. :P"

13-02-2018T22:38:14,Dadrobit,"Nah, you can see the direction the arm is pointing pretty clearly in the exposed area, doesn't match her elbow."

13-02-2018T22:38:57,Dadrobit,I have a ruler up to my screen right now and the top of her arm is pointing at the back of her elbow.
13-02-2018T22:39:08,JaydenMozingo,I see where he's talking about but I'm not ragging on Tom

13-02-2018T22:43:00,TorqueEmUp,unsteddy doesn't seem to think so
13-02-2018T22:43:24,Behrkave,the arm looks fine to me
13-02-2018T22:43:31,Bgrmystr2,"Actually, he's said the same thing I did, Torque lol"

13-02-2018T22:44:12,Bgrmystr2,it depends on which side of her leg you look at
13-02-2018T22:44:14,unsteddyphoenix,Im not trying to white knight Tom or anything I just think it's right.
13-02-2018T22:44:16,Bgrmystr2,the illusion is real
13-02-2018T22:44:41,TheBeckoner,It's ok my dudes. We all die eventually.

13-02-2018T22:48:56,Dadrobit,"To get under her, it just needs to take a (probably) painful, but not impossible turn."
