28-06-2018T18:08:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"They’re so fluffy, it’s like they could float"
28-06-2018T18:08:39,Bgrmystr2,it was nearly 110 today
28-06-2018T18:08:44,Dadrobit,"Same, I feel bad for long haired doggos out here in the heat."
28-06-2018T18:08:44,Bgrmystr2,and it's storming it's ass off outside
28-06-2018T18:09:01,Bgrmystr2,hot AND wet.. worst of the gulf coast
28-06-2018T18:09:03,Gundurr,I live in the northern desert
28-06-2018T18:09:06,Bgrmystr2,for standard weather anyway
28-06-2018T18:09:07,SpazztasticKiwi,I like Pomeranians cause they’re like lil dust bunnies
28-06-2018T18:09:16,Gundurr,its real nice out today
28-06-2018T18:09:17,SpazztasticKiwi,But they’re so delicate
28-06-2018T18:09:35,SpazztasticKiwi,And hairy
28-06-2018T18:09:50,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, I don't really like poms, I always liked huskys more"
28-06-2018T18:09:54,Bgrmystr2,but they're not super fluffy
28-06-2018T18:09:56,SpazztasticKiwi,And I don’t like yappy
28-06-2018T18:10:36,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, I think that if I get a lazy pet, it'll just encourage me being lazy xD"
28-06-2018T18:10:43,SpazztasticKiwi,My mom has a chihuahua Pomeranian mix
28-06-2018T18:10:49,Dadrobit,"Not bad out here today. 106F, 39% humidity."
28-06-2018T18:10:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"If she walks off from him, he starts whining"
28-06-2018T18:11:06,SpazztasticKiwi,And I just :ctwokinds-sleepoverA:
28-06-2018T18:11:44,Bgrmystr2,bout 85% humidity atm xD
28-06-2018T18:12:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"You’re not drinking water , you’re breathing it"
28-06-2018T18:12:06,Gundurr,"so you want a small dog, that isnt yippy? thats going to be hard to find"
28-06-2018T18:12:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Exactly
28-06-2018T18:12:18,Bgrmystr2,"yeah kiwi, that's 100% of the time"
28-06-2018T18:12:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Might stick to cats
28-06-2018T18:12:39,Bgrmystr2,"if I got a cat, I'd at least want it to talk to me at least a little.."
28-06-2018T18:12:42,Gundurr,cats meow
28-06-2018T18:12:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Humidity and me don’t get along

28-06-2018T18:13:11,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d rather have wee little mews than yap yap yap yap yap whiiiiiiiine
28-06-2018T18:13:27,Gundurr,OH! a beagle is small and isnt yippy
28-06-2018T18:13:27,Dadrobit,Holy moley. Was looking at a Fennekin plush on WalMart. Thought it was about $14.99. Nope. $149.99. WTH?
28-06-2018T18:13:56,Dadrobit,Sorry for the non-sequitur.
28-06-2018T18:14:02,Dadrobit,Was just surprised.
28-06-2018T18:14:45,Gundurr,Beagles are just tiny Blood Hounds
28-06-2018T18:14:55,Dadrobit,Could get a proper Play Arts Kai for that tbh.
28-06-2018T18:15:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"As a Walmart employee, I can tell you why it’s so expensive"
28-06-2018T18:15:36,SpazztasticKiwi,"There’s an actual Fennekin inside. If you give it enough love, it comes to life"
28-06-2018T18:15:45,Gundurr,ew
28-06-2018T18:15:56,Dadrobit,Heckin' bought then.
28-06-2018T18:16:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"If things were like that, I’d understand more why it’s so expensive"
28-06-2018T18:16:29,Dadrobit,"Wait, how does one give it enough love? I don't have to cut a hole in it do I?"
28-06-2018T18:16:29,Gundurr,its probably the size of a door
28-06-2018T18:16:31,Xexanoth,that's one expensive plush
28-06-2018T18:16:46,Dadrobit,"18 inches, not even terribly huge."
28-06-2018T18:16:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Though the materials & labor thing that’s the actual reason is just as understandable
28-06-2018T18:16:56,Gundurr,ITS A RIP-OFF
28-06-2018T18:16:59,Bgrmystr2,"it's easy dadro, just rip out your heart, and give it to the lil buggar"
28-06-2018T18:17:20,Bgrmystr2,:D
28-06-2018T18:17:38,SpazztasticKiwi,You hug and talk nice to it and “feed” it til it comes to life
28-06-2018T18:17:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Only with the power of friendship will it live
28-06-2018T18:19:17,Dadrobit,"Sorry, but materials are cloth and cotton stuffing, and the labor is done by machines. Don't care if it's a foot and a half tall, it's not ""worth"" $150 lol."
28-06-2018T18:19:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I know
28-06-2018T18:19:47,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s true in some instances but sometimes they just spike a price tag cause they can
28-06-2018T18:20:02,SpazztasticKiwi,And because of the brand attached to it
28-06-2018T18:20:25,Gundurr,"""brand"""
28-06-2018T18:20:26,Dadrobit,"If it came from some specialty crafter, I'd maybe understand. But WalMart? That surprises me."
28-06-2018T18:20:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Walmart: your local rip off supermarket
28-06-2018T18:21:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Even we don’t understand half of the guidelines and rules we got
28-06-2018T18:21:36,SpazztasticKiwi,They don’t tell us much
28-06-2018T18:23:02,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not looking forward to Black Friday this year
28-06-2018T18:23:07,Dadrobit,Guess I'll just stick to my regular action figures then lol.
28-06-2018T18:23:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"Last Black Friday, some people were ignoring me telling them my lane was exit only"
28-06-2018T18:23:59,Gundurr,I want to play gme

28-06-2018T23:27:35,zolstarym,What are you going to name it?
28-06-2018T23:27:39,CrRAR,he could be YOUR antbro!
28-06-2018T23:27:42,Vatruvius,It most likely was foraging for food.

28-06-2018T23:29:02,Vatruvius,Common ants anyway.
28-06-2018T23:29:12,TheFDdriver,hmm
28-06-2018T23:29:20,Vatruvius,I am sure there are some rarer ones or even jungle ones that are worse.

28-06-2018T23:30:27,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s why ants were on chat
28-06-2018T23:30:31,unsteddyphoenix,No cute wolf girls for you
28-06-2018T23:30:35,SpazztasticKiwi,You got a visitor
28-06-2018T23:30:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,All the cute wolf girls
28-06-2018T23:30:44,TheFDdriver,and you kicked him
28-06-2018T23:30:50,CrRAR,lil dude just had the adventure of a lifetime.
28-06-2018T23:30:54,Gundurr,lol
28-06-2018T23:30:58,FuryFaZeFurry,thanks CrRAR
28-06-2018T23:31:00,TheFDdriver,XD indeed
28-06-2018T23:31:02,InTheLionsDen,"Five minutes later, it's back."
28-06-2018T23:31:10,CrRAR,If ants could ever experience fasttravel... that lil guy just did.
28-06-2018T23:31:14,Vatruvius,Unfortunately...if that ant never finds a common trail traversed by its colony then it will slowly starve to death.
28-06-2018T23:31:17,superwolfart,hi and nices you two
28-06-2018T23:31:32,CrRAR,He's got some stories to tell.
28-06-2018T23:31:33,TheFDdriver,rip lil'dude
28-06-2018T23:31:33,SpazztasticKiwi,You’re a ray of sunshine aren’t you
28-06-2018T23:31:39,FenceEqualizer,The ant will be back but in greater numbers
28-06-2018T23:31:40,Vatruvius,lol
28-06-2018T23:31:41,zolstarym,I would have taken it to the pound instead of making it fend for itself in the wild
28-06-2018T23:31:50,CrRAR,lol fence
28-06-2018T23:31:51,zolstarym,or maybe a rescue group
28-06-2018T23:31:53,unsteddyphoenix,lol
28-06-2018T23:32:16,unsteddyphoenix,ant lives matter
28-06-2018T23:32:27,Gundurr,"yes, aunt lives matter"
28-06-2018T23:32:30,superwolfart,what stories
28-06-2018T23:32:32,Bgrmystr2,I would have flattened it. Releasing the ant outside only allows it to tell the colony that there's food inside the house.
28-06-2018T23:32:33,TheFDdriver,that's why i use Ray's
28-06-2018T23:32:41,Bgrmystr2,and then they ALL come inside
28-06-2018T23:32:50,ZRO4825,"lol, I like it Sage ^_^"
28-06-2018T23:32:50,SpazztasticKiwi,The fridge half froze the strawberries in my cheesecake
28-06-2018T23:32:51,Bgrmystr2,no prisoners.
28-06-2018T23:32:51,TheFDdriver,XD basically
28-06-2018T23:33:13,Vatruvius,"I watch a Youtube channel about ants, they are very interesting. That and I have a slight interest in raising my own colony. Not there yet though. Need to find a queen during a neptial flight."

28-06-2018T23:34:57,CrRAR,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
28-06-2018T23:35:07,Vatruvius,Ants cannot inform their colony about food if it did not fine any. Just because it went into the house does not mean it knows there is food there. That and the likely hood a released ant will even find its colony is very rare.
28-06-2018T23:35:15,unsteddyphoenix,lol
28-06-2018T23:35:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Is this the scene where Trace tells Rose he’s joining the circus?
28-06-2018T23:35:23,unsteddyphoenix,wolves do laugh large huh
28-06-2018T23:35:31,Vatruvius,Flying ants are just elites...the to be queens and males to fertilize the queens.
