23-11-2018T00:00:17,SageSaga,Qwe- yes but you didnt provide an example
23-11-2018T00:00:27,SageSaga,http://ai.katbox.net/
23-11-2018T00:00:37,Bgrmystr2,"damn, sage is fast"
23-11-2018T00:00:47,SageSaga,well its right there-
23-11-2018T00:00:50,Mihari,I wanted to troll mod and delete that link XD
23-11-2018T00:00:52,RimaDraws,thank you sage ~
23-11-2018T00:00:52,SageSaga,under my stream
23-11-2018T00:00:55,Tharkis,"pfft, i do read the comic Bgrmystr! =P"
23-11-2018T00:00:55,qwe304,lemme get the vid back up to get ya an example
23-11-2018T00:00:56,Bgrmystr2,I went to paste it and it was already in the chat
23-11-2018T00:00:59,Tharkis,lol Mihari
23-11-2018T00:01:02,SageSaga,Mihari!
23-11-2018T00:01:06,Mihari,What?
23-11-2018T00:01:07,Bgrmystr2,hey Mihari
23-11-2018T00:01:09,SageSaga,Explain to Qwe why hes wrong
23-11-2018T00:01:11,Combak,Hi Mihari!
23-11-2018T00:01:13,SageSaga,and needs to shut up
23-11-2018T00:01:14,SageSaga,XD
23-11-2018T00:01:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Qwe is wrong cuz Sage says so...?
23-11-2018T00:01:36,SpazztasticKiwi,That work?
23-11-2018T00:01:42,RimaDraws,i also seriously wonder how to get my own website.do you pay for a domain?
23-11-2018T00:01:52,SageSaga,yes
23-11-2018T00:02:12,RimaDraws,i think i need to do research
23-11-2018T00:02:19,qwe304,"@SageSaga one example for you: @4:05, why would you spend $419 when a $229 cpu does the job 90% as well?"
23-11-2018T00:02:21,Mihari,Google domains!
23-11-2018T00:02:49,Mihari,Cause I want that extra 10%? :P
23-11-2018T00:03:05,SageSaga,also maybe the Mobo cost more?
23-11-2018T00:03:08,Bgrmystr2,and you can host your own domain
23-11-2018T00:03:13,Bgrmystr2,but you need a good connection for that
23-11-2018T00:03:24,Bgrmystr2,easier to buy one :u
23-11-2018T00:03:30,RimaDraws,@Mihari google domains?
23-11-2018T00:03:40,KiTA,Nearlyfreespeech.net
23-11-2018T00:03:48,KiTA,So I have a GTX 970
23-11-2018T00:03:51,Mihari,"Yes, for buying a domain they are a good place to do it"
23-11-2018T00:03:52,SageSaga,google domains is where i buy all my URLs currently
23-11-2018T00:03:59,Tharkis,ooh speaking of that
23-11-2018T00:03:59,RimaDraws,how much?
23-11-2018T00:04:01,Mihari,Hosting a site is another matter
23-11-2018T00:04:01,KiTA,"er, to explain, nearlyfreespeech is where I get all my domains and hosting"
23-11-2018T00:04:06,KiTA,But anyway
23-11-2018T00:04:09,Tharkis,i think i'm in the last year of my 20 year upfront payment for my domain
23-11-2018T00:04:16,Tharkis,so i really need to remember to re-up my domain
23-11-2018T00:04:17,KiTA,"I have a GTX 970, and I paid $250 for it years back"
23-11-2018T00:04:22,KiTA,"and I was thinking of upgrading, but..."
23-11-2018T00:04:27,Tharkis,especially now that Network Solutions isnt the ONLY registrar you can use
23-11-2018T00:04:29,KiTA,The GTX 970 is still one of the best cards out there
23-11-2018T00:04:39,Tharkis,because after 20 years i really dont like network solutions...
23-11-2018T00:04:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"I got a 970 too, great card"
23-11-2018T00:04:45,qwe304,@SageSaga a b450 mobo is cheaper than a z370 mobo
23-11-2018T00:04:49,SageSaga,Zro you there?
23-11-2018T00:04:55,KiTA,I keep crashing when trying to play Warhammer 40k Mechanicus
23-11-2018T00:05:04,KiTA,"I have a new PSU coming, it might be that, but I doubt it"
23-11-2018T00:05:13,ZRO4825,I am. Happy Birthday. :3
23-11-2018T00:05:22,KiTA,But if I wanted to get something better than a 970
23-11-2018T00:05:24,SageSaga,happy Birthday Zro
23-11-2018T00:05:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Me hitting my suddenly tripping stream: “Stop” *smack* “Lagging” *smack smack* “I’m trying to be entertained” *smacksmacksmack*
23-11-2018T00:05:30,KiTA,it's like $400 and I'd only gain like 5-10% bonus
23-11-2018T00:05:34,Bgrmystr2,I will wait for an hour cuz it's not tomorrow yet
23-11-2018T00:05:38,SageSaga,how is a 970 still one of the best?
23-11-2018T00:05:39,Bgrmystr2,>:U
23-11-2018T00:05:42,Tharkis,"hrm, does google host as well? i've been with godaddy for 15 years, but if i move my domain i might want ot consolidate to a single bill for my hosting + domain name"
23-11-2018T00:05:54,KiTA,Sage:  Bitcoin.
23-11-2018T00:05:59,KiTA,Bitcoin completely destroyed the GPU market
23-11-2018T00:06:02,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"its not one of the best, but still a good card"
23-11-2018T00:06:03,KiTA,stalled it outright for years.
23-11-2018T00:06:05,ZRO4825,970 is outperformed by roughly 13% by a 1060 6GB. 55% by a 1070.
23-11-2018T00:06:19,RimaDraws,you can register a domain as low as 12$ a year?
23-11-2018T00:06:26,Tharkis,"prior to that I just hosted my own apache server, but letting someone else do all the patches and maintnence and whatnot"
23-11-2018T00:06:30,KiTA,GPU Hierarchy
23-11-2018T00:06:33,Tharkis,"yes rima, youc an get them way cheaper than that even"
23-11-2018T00:06:35,Mihari,And in some cases it's even cheaper for the first Rima
23-11-2018T00:06:38,KiTA,GTX 970 is in the 5th bracket down
23-11-2018T00:06:42,qwe304,you can get an rx 480 on ebay for like $100
23-11-2018T00:06:43,KiTA,alongside the 1060
23-11-2018T00:06:43,RimaDraws,wow i never knew.
23-11-2018T00:06:48,ZRO4825,"That being said, unless you're going to a 1070 or better, it's not worth the money to upgrade from a 970 currently."
23-11-2018T00:06:50,Tharkis,i think i paid 150$ for 20 year registration on my domain name
23-11-2018T00:07:00,qwe304,an rx480 is just shy of a gtx 1060
23-11-2018T00:07:02,RimaDraws,they said ten years for $120
23-11-2018T00:07:03,KiTA,"above it is the 980 ($400), the 1070 is above that ($500), above that you get the 1080 ($900), and above that, the brand new 2080 ($1700)"
23-11-2018T00:07:06,RimaDraws,at most
23-11-2018T00:07:21,BobbyCorwinTruePotoo,never go full 2080
23-11-2018T00:07:23,Tharkis,all depends on the registrar
23-11-2018T00:07:24,KiTA,I can link the GPU hierarchy
23-11-2018T00:07:25,RimaDraws,i may be considering buying a domain
23-11-2018T00:07:30,KiTA,but IIRC sage doesn't like links?
23-11-2018T00:07:39,qwe304,no links kek
23-11-2018T00:07:41,ZRO4825,Honestly? A 2080 has roughly the same performance as a 1080ti and costs less atm. :joy:
23-11-2018T00:07:46,Mihari,"He's indifferent to them, people just usually don't ask first."
23-11-2018T00:07:53,qwe304,but muh raytracing
23-11-2018T00:08:05,BobbyCorwinTruePotoo,"wait, really? would have figured it would be more expensive"
23-11-2018T00:08:16,Tharkis,"if you ask, and you explain what you're linking and it's relevant to conversation nto just some random ""look at this !"" then sage is usually fine with links, but you gotta ask"
23-11-2018T00:08:22,Tharkis,it's in the rules *points below*
23-11-2018T00:08:29,BobbyCorwinTruePotoo,"don't get me wrong, a LOT of interesting tech in it, just dont' think anything would be using it game wise for a long while"
23-11-2018T00:08:34,KiTA,But yeah
23-11-2018T00:08:49,KiTA,"I mean, there's the 1070, the 980...  I haven't looked at AMD but I used to be ONLY an AMD / ATI guy"
23-11-2018T00:09:00,Bgrmystr2,"it's not 100% RTX cores, Bobby FYI"
23-11-2018T00:09:01,KiTA,I bought my PC like 6 years ago and there's not really any reason to upgrade yet
23-11-2018T00:09:19,Bgrmystr2,so yeah you can use a 2080 the same as you would a 1080ti
23-11-2018T00:09:28,Bgrmystr2,without RTX at all
23-11-2018T00:09:28,Zakuru,HI EVERYONE
23-11-2018T00:09:32,BobbyCorwinTruePotoo,hello
23-11-2018T00:09:33,Zakuru,now that my bf is gone lol im here
23-11-2018T00:09:33,Bgrmystr2,heya Zak
23-11-2018T00:09:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,HI Zaky
23-11-2018T00:09:44,BobbyCorwinTruePotoo,Im happy with my 1070
23-11-2018T00:09:47,BobbyCorwinTruePotoo,at 4k
23-11-2018T00:09:49,Zakuru,hows everyone?
23-11-2018T00:09:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Lost
23-11-2018T00:10:09,MarvTheHugPharaoh,In a Christmasy mood
23-11-2018T00:10:17,Zakuru,awesome! i just finished decorating the house
23-11-2018T00:10:24,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s all they’re playing at work on the radio
23-11-2018T00:10:26,totallynotTrace,yeah it looks like to 1060ti is the same as the 2060 exept the 2060 has 6 gb vram
23-11-2018T00:10:35,Tharkis,"hell, honestly for the most part i'm still happy with my dual 660ti which are 6 year old cards"
23-11-2018T00:10:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Sweet, Zak"
23-11-2018T00:10:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Christmas is already worn out with me
23-11-2018T00:10:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I still need to get started
23-11-2018T00:10:54,Tharkis,but they support 4k (on DP only) and support 3Dvision and 144hz monitors
23-11-2018T00:11:06,BobbyCorwinTruePotoo,games really haven't advanced to the point you really need state of the art cards
23-11-2018T00:11:07,SageSaga,but cant game at 4k
23-11-2018T00:11:16,SpazztasticKiwi,I at least have an idea for some Christmas gifts
23-11-2018T00:11:22,KiTA,I am looking ath the RX580
23-11-2018T00:11:23,BobbyCorwinTruePotoo,I only got the 1070 becase my old computer pooped
23-11-2018T00:11:24,Tharkis,i can play EverQuest in 4k just fine on those cards =D
23-11-2018T00:11:24,KiTA,it's only $200
23-11-2018T00:11:25,Tharkis,ducks
23-11-2018T00:11:28,RimaDraws,i need to get my tree up this weekend
23-11-2018T00:11:36,KiTA,but I don't htink it's worth it if I have a 970
23-11-2018T00:11:44,SageSaga,the 1070 is great
23-11-2018T00:11:46,KiTA,"I'm hoping my issues are power related, as I did just buy a EVGA Supernova G3"
23-11-2018T00:11:53,Tharkis,most of the games iv'e been playing as of late arent very graphics intensive
23-11-2018T00:12:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark will be doing a stream the 1st. And I have a friend whose sister thinks he hangs the moon so I’m considering gonna get a shirt or something for her
23-11-2018T00:12:12,BobbyCorwinTruePotoo,1070 is a beast.  I suggest skipping a few gens unless you're doing it for bragging
23-11-2018T00:12:16,SpazztasticKiwi,getting
23-11-2018T00:12:18,Tharkis,I was going to have to upgrade for FO76 but since that game looks like an unmitigated disaster i'll just skip for now
23-11-2018T00:12:25,totallynotTrace,"unless you absolutely want the best, a 970 is more than enough for pretty much all games atm"
23-11-2018T00:12:25,Mihari,"Thanks Tharkis, now I'm flooded with horror memories of Time raids."
23-11-2018T00:12:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I hope they gift wrap
23-11-2018T00:12:59,BobbyCorwinTruePotoo,"god, I've been watching 76 review videos for over an hour.  so bad ;w;"
23-11-2018T00:13:09,Mihari,"hehehehe, charm kiting giants hehehe"
23-11-2018T00:13:12,Tharkis,@Mihari would you believe that i STILL have never seen Saryn drop @#%@% time's antithisis?  I must be the only shaman int he game without one !
23-11-2018T00:13:19,ZRO4825,"That makes me sad. I kinda wanted to play this Fallout just cuz it's set in WV, lol"
23-11-2018T00:13:45,Mihari,That's kinda surprising
23-11-2018T00:13:45,Tharkis,"not that you need it anymore, but man, for the longest time i felt like half a shaman because i didnt have that one item lol"
23-11-2018T00:14:05,qwe304,fallout 76 looks like shit
23-11-2018T00:14:08,BobbyCorwinTruePotoo,"like, if they made it 5-10/month and said it would be a long developemnt cycle (w/o 60 up front) I'd jump on and give feedback"
23-11-2018T00:14:12,Tharkis,i still play EQ :ctharkis-uneasy:
23-11-2018T00:14:12,qwe304,literally and figuratively
23-11-2018T00:14:17,BobbyCorwinTruePotoo,that because it is shit
23-11-2018T00:14:43,Mihari,I wonder if Sage and I would still be on speaking terms if I still played WoW XD
23-11-2018T00:14:50,ZRO4825,"Tharkis, don't feel bad, I still play FFXI, though nowhere NEAR like I used to, lol"
23-11-2018T00:15:05,SageSaga,of course we would - i would just be waiting a lot more
23-11-2018T00:15:11,Mihari,LOL
23-11-2018T00:15:17,Mihari,I dunno some of those days...
23-11-2018T00:15:22,BobbyCorwinTruePotoo,I could go back to EvEonline :thinking:
23-11-2018T00:15:35,Tharkis,EverQuests' 25th expansion comes out in 2 weeks >_<
23-11-2018T00:15:40,Mihari,What?
23-11-2018T00:15:43,Mihari,Seriously?
23-11-2018T00:15:45,KiTA,EQ was good back in the day
23-11-2018T00:15:46,Tharkis,yup
23-11-2018T00:15:49,KiTA,I think they're still making expansions
23-11-2018T00:15:50,Mihari,That's nuts.
23-11-2018T00:16:10,BobbyCorwinTruePotoo,"damn, they really sticking to that ever thin"
23-11-2018T00:16:17,Mihari,I wish City of Heroes didn't get canned...
23-11-2018T00:16:20,KiTA,I never got very far into EQ
23-11-2018T00:16:22,Mihari,I loved that game.
23-11-2018T00:16:23,KiTA,I liked to solo
23-11-2018T00:16:26,KiTA,best I ever got was uh
23-11-2018T00:16:27,KiTA,Bard
23-11-2018T00:16:29,KiTA,I got pretty far as a bard
23-11-2018T00:16:30,SageSaga,I actually really didnt like city of heroes...
23-11-2018T00:16:40,Tharkis,"CoH was fun, it had a great character creator"
23-11-2018T00:16:41,KiTA,"I don't remember where, but there was some area that was literally an ocean of poo"
23-11-2018T00:16:43,Mihari,"Yah well, you're hyper critical about any super hero game XD"
23-11-2018T00:16:49,Tharkis,the content got really repetitive though
23-11-2018T00:16:52,KiTA,when I quit I was kiting flies in that area
23-11-2018T00:16:55,SageSaga,it was also over hyped for me
23-11-2018T00:16:58,Tharkis,DCUO has done a great job for the superhero MMO
23-11-2018T00:17:06,Mihari,No...
23-11-2018T00:17:11,Mihari,It really hasn't.
23-11-2018T00:17:14,Tharkis,I still poke my head into DCUO occasionally
23-11-2018T00:17:15,SageSaga,"people were like ""you can do anything!"" and i was like ""So im stuck in a wall- huh- guess you can do anything"""
23-11-2018T00:17:24,KiTA,I play WOW and FF14 alternating
23-11-2018T00:17:29,KiTA,WOW's latest expansion is horrible
23-11-2018T00:17:33,KiTA,"well, at least"
23-11-2018T00:17:34,KiTA,it's boring
23-11-2018T00:17:37,SageSaga,i dont know how people can play FF14
23-11-2018T00:17:39,KiTA,I got to level 113 and quit
23-11-2018T00:17:41,RimaDraws,good lord buying a domain is so easy
23-11-2018T00:17:47,Mihari,I really tried to love DCUO
23-11-2018T00:17:52,RimaDraws,all you do is type in a  domain you want to buy and boom
23-11-2018T00:17:58,SageSaga,me Too Mihari
23-11-2018T00:17:58,KiTA,FF14 just announced blue mage
23-11-2018T00:18:01,KiTA,so everyone's freaking excited
23-11-2018T00:18:21,Mihari,And to this day it bugs me that apparently the helicopters in DCUO go faster than super sonic speed.
23-11-2018T00:18:31,Mihari,Cause I could never catch them :P
23-11-2018T00:18:37,Tharkis,for a while i was leading the #1 villain league on USPC
23-11-2018T00:18:38,HeresyArtStream,I'm playing vanilla WoW right now. Never played WoW before but I am enjoying it.
23-11-2018T00:19:04,Tharkis,"worldwide firsts in a lot of the hardests feats and stuff, was a good time, but most of my friends stopped playing"
23-11-2018T00:19:06,Tharkis,now i'm a filthy casual
23-11-2018T00:19:10,SageSaga,i had this great plan to make a group of people in DCUO to make a Super Sentai squad
23-11-2018T00:19:18,SageSaga,and only i ever made the character
23-11-2018T00:19:19,RimaDraws,i need to play more DCUO
23-11-2018T00:19:22,RimaDraws,and WoW
23-11-2018T00:19:56,Tharkis,"DCUO style collection system is fantastic, i miss it in every other game i play hehe"
23-11-2018T00:20:07,RimaDraws,i loved it. but my computer is so slow to run it.
23-11-2018T00:20:22,Tharkis,DCUO will play on a PS3... a potato can run DCUO =D
23-11-2018T00:20:26,Mihari,I think I prefer champion's online for character creation customization.
23-11-2018T00:20:38,RimaDraws,not anymore tharkis
23-11-2018T00:20:41,SageSaga,omg Mihari! Remember when we found like 4 Power Girls?
23-11-2018T00:20:45,totallynotTrace,oi dont trash the ps3
23-11-2018T00:20:50,SageSaga,there was a bug and she just kept getting spawned
23-11-2018T00:20:56,Mihari,XD
23-11-2018T00:20:58,RimaDraws,i tried to play it last night and it won't play unless you transfer the data to a ps4
23-11-2018T00:21:48,Tharkis,"oh god, i should find my 1000000 superman bug screenshot it was hilarious"
23-11-2018T00:22:04,SageSaga,I did like Champions
23-11-2018T00:22:06,Tharkis,it crashed USPC completey =P
23-11-2018T00:22:14,SageSaga,it got old - but i did enjoy it for a while
23-11-2018T00:22:18,Tharkis,I couldnt get anyone i knew to play champions
23-11-2018T00:22:26,Tharkis,so i didnt really give it a fair shot
23-11-2018T00:22:41,Mihari,I made so many characters there... XD
23-11-2018T00:22:56,SageSaga,me too!
23-11-2018T00:23:02,RimaDraws,i need more gaming buddies
23-11-2018T00:23:06,SageSaga,My first was Lien though
23-11-2018T00:23:17,Tharkis,"my problem is i'm always a completionist with my characters, i dont like to make alts / extra characters i like to make one and stick with it and try to 'do everything'"
23-11-2018T00:23:26,SageSaga,"""What is your super power?"" ""Guns"" ""Huh"""
23-11-2018T00:23:40,Mihari,One thing I do love about Cryptic's games was that there was no 'unique names'
23-11-2018T00:24:02,Combak,Except for some sort of user ID?
23-11-2018T00:24:10,Mihari,"Nope, nothing"
23-11-2018T00:24:18,Mihari,I uses a handle system so you can have any character name
23-11-2018T00:24:28,Tharkis,yeah i always liked that with cryptic
23-11-2018T00:24:29,Combak,"I mean, was there a way to share? Become marked as friends?"
23-11-2018T00:24:30,Mihari,Like Character@Accountname
23-11-2018T00:24:45,Combak,"So, you couldn't impersonate someone?"
23-11-2018T00:24:48,HeresyArtStream,Kinda like Second Life's system?
23-11-2018T00:24:53,Tharkis,Diablo 3 kinda adopted that
23-11-2018T00:24:55,Mihari,Well you could try.
23-11-2018T00:25:04,Tharkis,you can name all your characters the same thing
23-11-2018T00:25:08,Mihari,But you'd need to match the account name
23-11-2018T00:25:32,Mihari,Yah Diablo is similar
23-11-2018T00:25:35,BobbyCorwinTruePotoo,this looks fantastic!
23-11-2018T00:25:52,Tharkis,"what's SL use now? when i was on SL when it first came out, you picked a first name, and then it gave you a last name based upon when you created it, then the last name would change after a set time and 'never be available again'"
23-11-2018T00:26:04,Tharkis,I had a whole bunch of angry furries yelling at me in SL
23-11-2018T00:26:09,Tharkis,because my name in SL was Tharkis Fox
23-11-2018T00:26:16,Tharkis,and they were jealous as hell that i had fox as a last name lol
23-11-2018T00:26:29,ZRO4825,lol
23-11-2018T00:26:30,Mihari,Furries... bah.
23-11-2018T00:26:36,Tharkis,"i'm like ""dude i didnt even get to pick it, dont get mad at ME!"""

23-11-2018T00:27:48,Tharkis,"I dont think of myself as a furry, i dont have a furry character, just a kemonomimi character, but i guess i am going to MFF next week and hanging out with some katbox people"

23-11-2018T00:33:48,RimaDraws,i am just trying to lose weight and keep off certain things
23-11-2018T00:33:54,RimaDraws,so you're borderline diabetic?
23-11-2018T00:34:06,SageSaga,im at risk
23-11-2018T00:34:13,SageSaga,but i have no symptoms
23-11-2018T00:34:22,SageSaga,but if i dont fix my body i probably will
23-11-2018T00:34:24,RimaDraws,yea my uncle is borderline. i dont know if there is a difference but he can't have certain things
23-11-2018T00:35:58,Tharkis,thankfully OTC heartburn stuff is sufficeint to fix the esophogeal erosion from frequent heartburn  Dr said i've got 'controlable' GERD
23-11-2018T00:36:06,RimaDraws,i think he said borderline A1
23-11-2018T00:36:07,Tharkis,but some foods i cant even look at without getting heartburn
23-11-2018T00:36:23,Combak,Interesting Sage.
23-11-2018T00:36:25,Tharkis,and they're not things that normal people think of as giving heartburn either =/
23-11-2018T00:36:29,Tharkis,like Oatmeal
23-11-2018T00:36:32,RimaDraws,i can't have anything spicy since it turns my insides out
23-11-2018T00:36:55,HeresyArtStream,I won a hotsauce eating contest with my college roommates. :V
23-11-2018T00:37:13,Combak,Thanks Heresy.

23-11-2018T00:39:09,RimaDraws,same heresy
23-11-2018T00:39:48,SageSaga,Thanksgiving - i got to watch everyone eat mashed potatoes and bread - and i ate a slice of beef

23-11-2018T00:40:06,Dadrobit,"Back again. Also, I wonder if that's something of a possibility that I should bring up to my doctor? I'm constantly dealing with ""heart attack"" heartburn and regularly deal with indigestion."
23-11-2018T00:40:24,HeresyArtStream,The beef is the good part anyway.
23-11-2018T00:40:26,SageSaga,"""Do you want some more?"" ""Nope im full"" ""Really?"" ""Yeah its weird"""
23-11-2018T00:40:35,HeresyArtStream,Although turning down stuffing and pie would be a bit too much for me. :P
23-11-2018T00:40:54,Dadrobit,Done two visits prior that they've stuck a camera down my throat and told me it's just a hiatial hernia and that I just need to eat healthy.
23-11-2018T00:40:57,HeresyArtStream,I planned on being terrible on Thanksgiving so I really watched what I at in the weeks leading up to the holiday.
23-11-2018T00:40:58,SageSaga,oh that was the worse part
23-11-2018T00:41:05,SageSaga,they had chocolate pie and apple pie
23-11-2018T00:41:22,Tharkis,"sage, if you're ever up in new england let me buy you a steak =P"
23-11-2018T00:41:31,HeresyArtStream,Tomorrow I gotta go back to like 5 net grams of carbs per meal for like a week. :P

23-11-2018T00:46:54,Tharkis,"awesome job!  Honestly, i think one of my favorite colored pics you've done this year, Tom !"

23-11-2018T00:47:05,Tharkis,"the blue on one side, red on the other side lighting is lovely"
23-11-2018T00:47:07,Bgrmystr2,"are you gonna put it on your patreon, tom? :O"
23-11-2018T00:47:56,totallynotTrace,"wake up in the morning ""wow am I outragously full or really humgry?"" *rumble bumble grrrrrm* "" ok so am i really hungry or about to violently eject food?"""
23-11-2018T00:48:26,Bgrmystr2,"if it's morning, probably both"
23-11-2018T00:48:40,SageSaga,rumbles from your stomach- are lies- that noise isnt made in your stomach- that is poop moving through your intestines!
23-11-2018T00:48:51,Bgrmystr2,not always
23-11-2018T00:48:56,totallynotTrace,ive had that too
23-11-2018T00:49:00,Bgrmystr2,sometimes it is your stomach
23-11-2018T00:49:19,SageSaga,how?
23-11-2018T00:49:24,Kynum,Welp. I'm not gonna lingerie around.
23-11-2018T00:49:28,InTheLionsDen,:ctwokinds-florajiggle:
23-11-2018T00:49:49,Bgrmystr2,the video and audio on tom's stream is not synced

23-11-2018T00:50:36,totallynotTrace,ive had both rumble at the same time
23-11-2018T00:50:37,SageSaga,the only noise your stomach can make is releasing air - the stomach itself doesnt move
23-11-2018T00:51:03,SageSaga,there's also no nerves inside it so you cant feel it
23-11-2018T00:51:03,Bgrmystr2,"it gets bigger and smaller though, depending if you've eaten"
23-11-2018T00:51:25,totallynotTrace,the stomach does contract and if there is are that air moving creates noise
23-11-2018T00:51:28,ShaneProductionz,"how do we get from fasting, to mf stomach functions"
23-11-2018T00:51:39,BadFoMo,Pre-Order AI The Game at EB Games and get the Lingerie outfit for Nyna free!

23-11-2018T00:52:10,Bgrmystr2,this is normal
23-11-2018T00:52:14,Tharkis,"chat, so laser focused that nyna would pounce it.... or not..."
23-11-2018T00:52:14,totallynotTrace,we had to tone down the sexy
23-11-2018T00:52:25,Tharkis,yeah pretty normal for chat to go off the rails at least once every 15 minutes
23-11-2018T00:52:25,Bgrmystr2,"probably, tharkis"
23-11-2018T00:52:29,Bgrmystr2,the problem is..
23-11-2018T00:52:41,Bgrmystr2,everyone has a laser pointer and they're all going in different directions
23-11-2018T00:52:43,ShaneProductionz,atleast we have a conversation thats constant

23-11-2018T00:54:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"If the set was pink or something, you could’ve called it “birthday cake”"

23-11-2018T01:21:02,RimaDraws,sage question i am building a website and which setting did you choose?
23-11-2018T01:21:27,SageSaga,I chose Mihari
23-11-2018T01:21:33,RimaDraws,it says online store blog etc
23-11-2018T01:22:11,SageSaga,i didnt do a website like that
23-11-2018T01:22:22,RimaDraws,oh? then how
23-11-2018T01:22:25,SageSaga,when i first started i had to write my own code and build it from the ground up
23-11-2018T01:22:32,RimaDraws,i dont know how to write codes
23-11-2018T01:22:44,SageSaga,Mihari will vouch that it was awful XD
23-11-2018T01:22:57,SageSaga,what is the site for?
23-11-2018T01:23:47,RimaDraws,well just for an upcoming story i want to make into a comic. of course if i need to write my own codes i can forget it
23-11-2018T01:24:43,SageSaga,if you want to make a comic site i recommend using wordpress and they have a Comic Management System you can install into Wordpress
23-11-2018T01:24:43,Mihari,Wordpress + Inkblot Theme + Webcomic Plugin = Easy webcomic startup
23-11-2018T01:25:57,RimaDraws,oh okay so try word press
23-11-2018T01:27:39,RimaDraws,bluehost is the website that wordpress goes with
23-11-2018T01:29:33,SageSaga,brb
23-11-2018T01:29:36,RimaDraws,oki
23-11-2018T01:32:08,SageSaga,back

23-11-2018T01:33:35,SageSaga,SHE HAD 6 FINGERS!
23-11-2018T01:33:46,SageSaga,AND NO ONE SAID ANYTHING!  - Except Mihari
23-11-2018T01:34:05,Mihari,"I would have said something sooner, but I was complaining about something more pressing"
23-11-2018T01:34:17,RimaDraws,lol
23-11-2018T01:41:16,Bgrmystr2,"wait, who had six fingers?"
23-11-2018T01:41:47,Twokinds,"That's how many fingers a person has, isn't it?"
23-11-2018T01:42:10,SageSaga,none of yall noticed!
23-11-2018T01:42:27,Mihari,"Not true, just not saying anything else"
23-11-2018T01:42:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Thought it was six finger Thursday, my b"
23-11-2018T01:42:52,ZRO4825,I was distracted.
23-11-2018T01:46:39,SageSaga,Zro- what color are the outfits?
23-11-2018T01:46:51,SageSaga,if you say clear im ending the stream
23-11-2018T01:46:58,RimaDraws,Looking good sage
23-11-2018T01:47:56,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah looks really nice~
23-11-2018T01:48:44,RimaDraws,I need to stream tomorrow. Gonna try to attempt drawing concept art
23-11-2018T01:48:51,ZRO4825,I would never say clear.
23-11-2018T01:48:55,ZRO4825,Clear isn't a color.
23-11-2018T01:49:14,Bgrmystr2,they're not clear. they're skin-colored. :ptv-SteelwormHades:
23-11-2018T01:49:17,ZRO4825,:thinking:
23-11-2018T01:49:28,ZRO4825,"Bgr tryin to get me in more trouble than I get myself in, jeez D:"
23-11-2018T01:49:36,unsteddyphoenix,Have their outfits be the other persons hair lol
23-11-2018T01:49:37,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
23-11-2018T01:49:45,ZRO4825,"That's actually what I was thinking Unsteddy, lol"
23-11-2018T01:49:55,unsteddyphoenix,Great minds
23-11-2018T01:50:35,ZRO4825,"Would that work, Sage?"
23-11-2018T01:50:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"They’re not “clear” colored, of course not"
23-11-2018T01:50:49,SpazztasticKiwi,They’re “transparent” colored
23-11-2018T01:50:55,Bgrmystr2,lolol xD
23-11-2018T01:51:16,ZRO4825,"You ALL trying to get me in more trouble, jeez, bad enough I already got Patreon all pissy-pantsed at him. :joy:"
23-11-2018T01:51:34,Mihari,"If I've learned anything from make-up and underwear colours, ""naked"" is a perfectly acceptable colour name."
23-11-2018T01:51:36,Combak,Man it's late...
23-11-2018T01:51:39,Combak,Night all!
23-11-2018T01:51:46,RimaDraws,Nude
23-11-2018T01:51:50,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s “nude” colored
23-11-2018T01:52:04,Mihari,"Yes, that's it. XD I need sleep."
23-11-2018T01:52:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Which doesn’t make sense provided “nude” is multiple colors due to the fact not everyone is the same shade nude
23-11-2018T01:53:03,ZRO4825,"Right, Kiwi?"
23-11-2018T01:53:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Especially those of us with “my window is on my right and I don’t leave the house” tan lines
23-11-2018T01:53:27,ZRO4825,"I have that problem more in the color, lol"
23-11-2018T01:53:31,ZRO4825,in the car*
23-11-2018T01:55:34,SpazztasticKiwi,The white looks good on them
23-11-2018T01:55:42,Twokinds,Bed time! G'night! :ctwokinds-natanisleep:

23-11-2018T01:56:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,gremlins? like gizmo?
23-11-2018T01:57:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"Sage, what about a polka dot and star pattern for them"
23-11-2018T01:57:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Or stripes

23-11-2018T01:57:51,SpazztasticKiwi,"While we’re at it, why not a world map theme"
23-11-2018T01:59:27,MarvTheHugPharaoh,The world is on her boobs.  can you find where you are?
23-11-2018T01:59:56,Mihari,groans.

23-11-2018T02:01:07,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
23-11-2018T02:01:14,ZRO4825,I was kinda agreeing with Unsteddy to give'em the other one's hair color?
23-11-2018T02:01:21,ZRO4825,"I'm kinda terrible when it comes to colors, lol"
23-11-2018T02:01:23,SageSaga,then i must have missed it- or blocked it out because it was stupid
23-11-2018T02:01:32,Bgrmystr2,wow.
23-11-2018T02:01:36,ZRO4825,lol
23-11-2018T02:01:41,Bgrmystr2,and then you yell at zro

23-11-2018T02:01:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Like a splatter pattern maybe?
23-11-2018T02:01:59,SageSaga,look at those eyes
23-11-2018T02:02:02,SageSaga,hes dead inside
23-11-2018T02:02:23,ZRO4825,"Okay, let's be real here, my favorite color is orange. Obviously my color tastes are not going to be correct. ^_^"
23-11-2018T02:02:27,Bgrmystr2,I wouldn't know
23-11-2018T02:02:28,MarvTheHugPharaoh,♪Dead inside.  My heart and soul flat-lines♪
23-11-2018T02:02:46,SageSaga,Ok- Orange on Toyoko- what on Relm?
23-11-2018T02:02:53,ZRO4825,"Oh, a nice green?"
23-11-2018T02:02:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Pink
23-11-2018T02:03:06,Bgrmystr2,I still like the opposite hair colors xD I always did like blue and red swimsuits
23-11-2018T02:03:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,that fades into purple
23-11-2018T02:03:14,Bgrmystr2,oo

23-11-2018T02:03:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Green would set off the hair...
23-11-2018T02:03:20,Bgrmystr2,mihari is hating
23-11-2018T02:03:26,Mihari,Yep

23-11-2018T02:03:35,SageSaga,i didnt even see it
23-11-2018T02:03:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,all I said was pink
23-11-2018T02:03:44,ZRO4825,Marv suggested pink :P
23-11-2018T02:03:45,Mihari,they suggested pink
23-11-2018T02:03:48,SageSaga,ah

23-11-2018T02:03:50,Mihari,I denied it
23-11-2018T02:03:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,that fades into purple
23-11-2018T02:04:02,Bgrmystr2,it's sage's choice though? rofl
23-11-2018T02:04:05,Dadrobit,"Alright, my download speeds are too retarded to continue. Being measures in kbps. Not even coming close to a single gig. I think I'm done for now. I need to get on the horn and yell at Cox."
23-11-2018T02:04:13,Mihari,Is it really?
23-11-2018T02:04:22,Bgrmystr2,he's the one drawin it lol
23-11-2018T02:04:27,Mihari,Is it REALLY?
23-11-2018T02:04:31,SageSaga,you dont understand
23-11-2018T02:04:36,SageSaga,Mihari holds veto power
23-11-2018T02:04:40,SageSaga,over my soul
23-11-2018T02:04:43,Bgrmystr2,pff
23-11-2018T02:04:47,unsteddyphoenix,Oof
23-11-2018T02:04:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,She is too powerful
23-11-2018T02:04:57,SageSaga,with a single utterance- i cease to be
23-11-2018T02:04:58,SpazztasticKiwi,What bet did you lose?
23-11-2018T02:05:02,Mihari,"On some things, afterall Zro is getting this picture XD"
23-11-2018T02:05:02,Bgrmystr2,yeah I won't believe that. Sorry xD
23-11-2018T02:05:04,Dadrobit,"So have a good one y'all, thanks for what I could catch of the stream."
23-11-2018T02:05:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,see ya daddy
23-11-2018T02:05:17,Bgrmystr2,seeya later dadro

23-11-2018T02:05:45,ZRO4825,"Have a good one, Dadro. ^^/"
23-11-2018T02:05:50,ZRO4825,Again? D:
23-11-2018T02:05:50,DarthRexKing,I like hero academia. X3
23-11-2018T02:05:53,Mihari,Altho technically I should cancel that for this year XD
23-11-2018T02:05:57,unsteddyphoenix,later dad
23-11-2018T02:06:00,Mihari,I paid in Rem!
23-11-2018T02:06:05,DarthRexKing,Mihari! o3o
23-11-2018T02:06:15,ZRO4825,I found a long-haired neko-maid Rem picture the other day
23-11-2018T02:06:20,SageSaga,Rem was a birthday gift!
23-11-2018T02:06:26,Mihari,Exactly
23-11-2018T02:06:32,SageSaga,you cant use birthday gifts as leverage!
23-11-2018T02:06:38,Mihari,I can't? XD
23-11-2018T02:06:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Well it’s 1. I got work. But the orange is really good on Toyoko Sage
23-11-2018T02:06:44,SageSaga,so cruel!
23-11-2018T02:06:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Night night
23-11-2018T02:07:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Nighty night kiwi
23-11-2018T02:08:33,Kullax,"Good Morning~ Sage, November is not bikini season, silly"
23-11-2018T02:08:57,SageSaga,black is more Toyoko's style- though she'd never wear a bikini like this
23-11-2018T02:09:13,SageSaga,Kullax- i am very aware
23-11-2018T02:09:32,ZRO4825,Every season is bikini season if you're brave enough.
23-11-2018T02:09:41,Bgrmystr2,+3 bravery
23-11-2018T02:09:46,Mihari,I believe the term is stupid in that case.
23-11-2018T02:10:03,ZRO4825,"Well, the two aren't exactly mutually exclusive, Mihari =P"
23-11-2018T02:10:22,Mihari,"No, but I'm pretty sure it is just stupid in this case."
23-11-2018T02:10:27,ZRO4825,lol
23-11-2018T02:10:40,Bgrmystr2,opinions lol
23-11-2018T02:11:06,ZRO4825,"Now the only question after this is. Do we go Christmas bikinis next month, or do I try to come up with something NOT Christmas themed since I'm pretty sure Sage probably has a lot of those on the plate already, lol"
23-11-2018T02:11:21,Mihari,I'm pretty sure I can give valid points why wearing a bikini in the middle of freezing winter isn't a smart idea.
23-11-2018T02:11:34,ZRO4825,"We never said it was smart, Mihari."
23-11-2018T02:11:43,Bgrmystr2,noone said anything about freezing winter. I guess the tropics don't exist lol
23-11-2018T02:11:45,ZRO4825,I'm not THAT dumb. =D
23-11-2018T02:11:58,ZRO4825,"According to my wallet, Bgr, no, no they do not."
23-11-2018T02:12:08,Mihari,"No one said freezing winter, true, but they did say every season"
23-11-2018T02:12:23,Mihari,freezing winter is included in that.
23-11-2018T02:12:25,ZRO4825,"Well, I mean, the only two seasons are Summer, and Potholes, right?"
23-11-2018T02:12:29,Bgrmystr2,"well, Hawaii has winter. It doesn't snow there unless you go up the mountain"
23-11-2018T02:12:54,Mihari,The statement was region locked...
23-11-2018T02:12:57,Mihari,wasn't*

23-11-2018T03:07:29,Bgrmystr2,he's got a pretty good pc for the price
23-11-2018T03:08:01,Vatruvius,Hello everyone! Didn't even realize a stream was going on...
23-11-2018T03:08:09,SageSaga,gimme the specs boy i ain't no scrub
23-11-2018T03:08:12,Vatruvius,Happy Birthday Sage!
23-11-2018T03:08:18,SageSaga,thanks Vat
23-11-2018T03:10:03,ZRO4825,"Sorry, was sidetracked by stuff to do with CPU coolers, lol"
23-11-2018T03:10:04,SageSaga,looks similar to the computer i built for my father
23-11-2018T03:11:04,Vatruvius,"ZRO is Sage's father, comfirmed!"
23-11-2018T03:11:05,Vatruvius,XD
23-11-2018T03:11:13,SageSaga,that's dumb
23-11-2018T03:11:24,Bgrmystr2,lool
23-11-2018T03:11:58,SageSaga,why would my father be building a computer exactly like what he has now?
23-11-2018T03:12:16,Vatruvius,It was not meant to make sense...
23-11-2018T03:12:24,Vatruvius,That is kind of the point of the joke...
23-11-2018T03:12:35,SageSaga,your logic is so flawed im sure a physicist just killed himself
23-11-2018T03:12:49,SageSaga,probably un related
23-11-2018T03:12:51,SageSaga,but still
23-11-2018T03:13:15,Bgrmystr2,:fire: :fire_engine: brutal
23-11-2018T03:13:18,Vatruvius,Isn't the point of such a joke to poke fun at such obviously bad logic?
23-11-2018T03:13:28,SageSaga,nope

23-11-2018T03:13:41,Vatruvius,"""Can we bring in a philosopher in here please..."""
23-11-2018T03:13:50,unsteddyphoenix,"His wife took the kids and the house, but it was the logic that did it"
23-11-2018T03:14:05,Vatruvius,There is more than one type of joke...
23-11-2018T03:14:28,SageSaga,so your's was a bad joke
23-11-2018T03:14:43,Vatruvius,"In its nature, yes...that was the point."
23-11-2018T03:15:13,SageSaga,i have a recommendation
23-11-2018T03:15:20,SageSaga,make good jokes.
23-11-2018T03:15:59,SageSaga,also Vat
23-11-2018T03:16:01,SageSaga,im sorry
23-11-2018T03:16:03,Vatruvius,"I will try, but no guarantees..."
23-11-2018T03:16:10,Vatruvius,What for?
23-11-2018T03:16:22,SageSaga,please dont take what i said too harsh ^^ im just having fun and taking it too far
23-11-2018T03:16:36,Vatruvius,"No, no...it is quite alright."
23-11-2018T03:17:30,Vatruvius,"Good news, my drawing tablet is on its way and will arrive tomorrow...just in time to be wrapped for Christmas. :3"
23-11-2018T03:17:42,ZRO4825,Nice ^^
23-11-2018T03:17:55,SageSaga,what kind?
23-11-2018T03:18:08,Vatruvius,"Huion Kamvas...the 15"" one."
23-11-2018T03:18:16,SageSaga,display tablet?
23-11-2018T03:18:21,Vatruvius,Yeah...
23-11-2018T03:18:23,SageSaga,i dont know the Huion names all that well
23-11-2018T03:18:26,SageSaga,sweet
23-11-2018T03:18:36,SageSaga,wait- who is it for?
23-11-2018T03:18:40,Vatruvius,For me...
23-11-2018T03:18:50,SageSaga,why would you wrap it for christmas?
23-11-2018T03:18:50,Vatruvius,A gift I know of...but I do not have to pay for...
23-11-2018T03:19:00,SageSaga,ah darn
23-11-2018T03:19:02,SageSaga,i get it now
23-11-2018T03:19:27,SageSaga,i would have waited on ordering it
23-11-2018T03:19:27,Vatruvius,"I tend to like expensive gifts, so I get like one gift and some small stuff on Christmas from the family."
23-11-2018T03:19:43,SageSaga,electronics are something you need to use right away to see if they are faulty so you can return them
23-11-2018T03:20:04,Vatruvius,"We were going to wait for a Cyber sale or something, then the stocks started to run low on Amazon so we played it safe...we still saved $200"
23-11-2018T03:20:23,Vatruvius,"That is true, I could make sure it is functional..."
23-11-2018T03:20:30,DarthRexKing,Good night everyone.
23-11-2018T03:20:34,ZRO4825,"That's the same way I am, Vatru. Like I know this year I'm getting a Switch, and only one game for sure. Other than that, it'll be all small stuff."
23-11-2018T03:20:37,Vatruvius,Goodnight Darth...
23-11-2018T03:21:09,SageSaga,for my birthday- my parents are paying for me to be able to see an optometrist
23-11-2018T03:21:33,SageSaga,would yall believe me if i told ya im practically blind?
23-11-2018T03:21:53,Vatruvius,"Well, that is something right? They can be expensive."
23-11-2018T03:22:04,Vatruvius,What are you hoping they can do?
23-11-2018T03:22:28,SageSaga,new glasses
23-11-2018T03:22:34,unsteddyphoenix,Then how you draw good? :thinking:
23-11-2018T03:22:40,Vatruvius,*gasp* No way!
23-11-2018T03:22:43,SageSaga,im near sighted!
23-11-2018T03:23:06,Bgrmystr2,"I'm actually fairly close to blind as well, I believe"
23-11-2018T03:23:21,SageSaga,im less than 2 feet from the screen i have chat on- without my glasses i cant read a thing
23-11-2018T03:23:21,Bgrmystr2,I had my eye scores back before I moved.. but then I moved. :(
23-11-2018T03:23:24,Vatruvius,"A lot of people use glasses now, I have noticed."
23-11-2018T03:23:38,Bgrmystr2,Oh you need new glasses then yeah sage
23-11-2018T03:23:58,SageSaga,ive had these glasses for over 16 years
23-11-2018T03:24:09,Vatruvius,Way to make good use of them...
23-11-2018T03:24:11,Bgrmystr2,how close do you have to be if you don't have glasses on?
23-11-2018T03:24:58,SageSaga,13 inches to make your line visible just enough to read it
23-11-2018T03:25:09,Bgrmystr2,oh that's not so bad
23-11-2018T03:25:18,Bgrmystr2,I'm less than half of that.
23-11-2018T03:25:33,SageSaga,you are near sighted only out to 7 inches?
23-11-2018T03:25:45,Bgrmystr2,about 6 before it starts becoming readable yes
23-11-2018T03:25:54,Vatruvius,"Wow...and now I feel like that ""special kid"" with 20/20. . ."
23-11-2018T03:25:56,C0mic,Consider contacts
23-11-2018T03:25:57,ZRO4825,"I'm around Sage's range, maybe JUST a bit further out."
23-11-2018T03:26:14,SageSaga,contacts are for weirdos that can put things on their eye
23-11-2018T03:26:27,Bgrmystr2,^ agree with sage
23-11-2018T03:26:36,Bgrmystr2,I am not one of those people.
23-11-2018T03:26:56,Vatruvius,They have their uses...for instance my cousin plays baseball. Very useful in sports over glasses.
23-11-2018T03:27:00,C0mic,Yeah I prob can't see how thats an improvement to glasses
23-11-2018T03:28:00,Bgrmystr2,"if the baseball smacks you in the face, your glasses can go into your eye"
23-11-2018T03:28:06,Bgrmystr2,and glasses get real sharp if they break
23-11-2018T03:28:23,Vatruvius,"Yes, and running with glasses that fall off is not good either."
23-11-2018T03:28:32,Bgrmystr2,"yup, though that's less of a problem"
23-11-2018T03:28:34,ZRO4825,"Yeah, contacts are WAY better if you're an outdoorsy type. Less chance of them randomly getting lost off your face or broken, plus, you can wear sunglasses and don't have to pay for transition lenses that way."
23-11-2018T03:28:50,Bgrmystr2,because they have those rubber glasses holder things you put on the arms when you wear em
23-11-2018T03:28:59,SageSaga,my face looks so naked and lewd without glasses!
23-11-2018T03:29:42,Vatruvius,You grow use to them...I get it. I wear blue-light glasses and I am starting to forget to take them off when I leave the screen.
23-11-2018T03:33:23,Vatruvius,OH MY GOD!
23-11-2018T03:33:40,sunblaze,good morning everyone

23-11-2018T03:47:27,ZRO4825,Which is DUMB.
23-11-2018T03:47:28,Bgrmystr2,I think there's so many more worse images you already have on there besides this one lool
23-11-2018T03:47:35,Bgrmystr2,so I dunno how this one would magically do it

23-11-2018T03:49:03,SageSaga,most of them are already on the Tumblr

23-11-2018T03:59:01,sunblaze,feel free to give me a note sage
23-11-2018T03:59:09,sunblaze,otherwise I will probably forget it
23-11-2018T03:59:20,SageSaga,are you interested in both or one and if so - which one? XD
23-11-2018T03:59:44,SageSaga,and if you are hear i can pretty much guarantee you will hear about it again XD

23-11-2018T04:00:34,SageSaga,i can only think of ONE person who would buy a Toyoko daki- which is why it is so unlikely to happen
23-11-2018T04:01:07,Bgrmystr2,can't you special order one if they pay you upfront sage?
23-11-2018T04:01:12,sunblaze,nyna looks better up front and kalyns ass is bigger. so 50/50 :D
23-11-2018T04:01:16,Bgrmystr2,or do they have to be ordered in bulk?
23-11-2018T04:01:36,SageSaga,Kaylin's butt is actually smaller but the tight pants are working it for her XD
23-11-2018T04:01:51,sunblaze,good choice of dress then!
23-11-2018T04:02:29,SageSaga,and Bgr- i would lose a lot in shipping costs buying a single item
23-11-2018T04:02:47,SageSaga,"and printing cost goes up too- its better in ""bulk"" even if bulk is only 20"

23-11-2018T14:38:35,Twokinds,Black friday got me.
23-11-2018T14:39:48,FoxxTrotter,Not me. I stayed home.
23-11-2018T14:40:01,BadFoMo,What did you get?
23-11-2018T14:40:23,Twokinds,12 pack of sharpies. 4 dollars.
23-11-2018T14:40:41,CrimsonQuill,It got me too.
23-11-2018T14:40:50,CrimsonQuill,But at least you got pencils.
23-11-2018T14:40:59,CrimsonQuill,"Me, I wasted it on video games."
23-11-2018T14:42:01,Kinipshun,graphics card prices have gone down considerably. still unfortunately out of my price range
23-11-2018T14:42:17,Kinipshun,"(for black friday, that is)"
23-11-2018T14:42:44,CrimsonQuill,I just dfound some games on sale on Steam.
23-11-2018T14:42:53,CrimsonQuill,I want to see what Skyrim's like.
23-11-2018T14:42:58,FoxxTrotter,I'll order clothes online from Duluth Trading Company like I usually do. No hurry on that.
23-11-2018T14:43:31,CrimsonQuill,I'll be back in a bit
23-11-2018T14:43:48,iliar,$4 per all or per one?

23-11-2018T14:47:12,FoxxTrotter,:0)
23-11-2018T14:47:31,Twokinds,Seemed like a good deal.
23-11-2018T14:47:39,Twokinds,I do always need pens.
23-11-2018T14:48:07,Twokinds,I lose them all the time.
23-11-2018T14:48:22,Twokinds,"I once bought a 50 pack of pens so that if I lost the one I was using, I could just get another one from the box."
23-11-2018T14:48:30,Twokinds,"50 pens later, the box is empty. I can't find the pens."
23-11-2018T14:49:06,iliar,$ 4 for all. Looks very cheap. Although I don't know what the usual cost for sharpies.
23-11-2018T14:49:31,Twokinds,Usually 50 - 1 dollar.
23-11-2018T14:49:35,iliar,"And Tom, can you go to IRC?"
23-11-2018T14:49:39,Kinipshun,sounds like you have marker elves
23-11-2018T14:49:53,Twokinds,Silver ones are the most expensive. And it's the ones I use the most for signing.
23-11-2018T14:50:20,Kinipshun,yeah we go through silver ones like crazy at one of my churches
23-11-2018T14:57:17,Twokinds,"The worst part is, the times I've bought a huge box of them, they're all worthlessly dried out."
23-11-2018T14:57:37,SageSaga,uhg
23-11-2018T14:57:40,SageSaga,that sucks
23-11-2018T14:57:43,TerraTheWizard,oof
23-11-2018T14:57:51,Twokinds,The blister pack of pens are the only ones that consistantly work for me.
23-11-2018T14:58:05,Kinipshun,you gotta store em tip down
23-11-2018T14:58:40,Kinipshun,i have a bunch from like 5 years ago and theyre all stored tip down. all of em still work

23-11-2018T15:05:30,CrimsonQuill,@SageSaga Do you like curries?
23-11-2018T15:06:30,SageSaga,cant have curry

23-11-2018T15:08:50,SageSaga,yo Sunblaze
23-11-2018T15:08:53,CrimsonQuill,@SageSaga does that mean spicy stuff burns your stomach?
23-11-2018T15:09:11,SageSaga,nope
23-11-2018T15:09:26,CrimsonQuill,What happens?
23-11-2018T15:09:42,SageSaga,it means certain things trigger acid from my stomach to jump out of my stomach and into places where you dont have natural protections from the acid- like your throat
23-11-2018T15:09:56,CrimsonQuill,OUCH.
23-11-2018T15:10:03,sunblaze,its not the stomach that burns.
23-11-2018T15:10:08,sunblaze,but the whole throat
23-11-2018T15:10:33,SageSaga,the stomach is built to hold acid safely- the throat is not
23-11-2018T15:10:42,CrimsonQuill,I know that.
23-11-2018T15:10:48,CrimsonQuill,"But still, OUCH."
23-11-2018T15:11:04,Bgrmystr2,that's literally heartburn yeah
23-11-2018T15:11:07,Bgrmystr2,hurts like a bitch
23-11-2018T15:16:19,Twokinds,Gotta tell the stomach to get it's act together.
23-11-2018T15:17:02,Twokinds,Stop having acid where it doesn't belong.
23-11-2018T15:17:33,SageSaga,"it's not just stomach's fault, it's also Throat to Stomach Sphincter's fault"
23-11-2018T15:17:40,CrimsonQuill,True that Tom
23-11-2018T15:17:51,Bgrmystr2,yeah.. it's all just.. not doing it's job
23-11-2018T15:17:56,Bgrmystr2,and it should stop not doing that thing.
23-11-2018T15:23:17,SageSaga,there is no cure
23-11-2018T15:24:50,SageSaga,there is a procedure but it only a temporary solution 40% of the time

23-11-2018T15:25:48,sunblaze,^clearly a sign if credibility
23-11-2018T15:26:07,SageSaga,i dont know how to tell you- oh wait no i do- the internet is not a person- it cannot tell you things itself.

23-11-2018T15:52:19,SageSaga,he said he went up and down every aisle and there were none with cheese

23-11-2018T15:55:16,CrimsonQuill,"Sage, have you ever tried Shropshire Blue?"
23-11-2018T15:55:38,SageSaga,"you have your brand names, your second tier brand names, your local stores brand, and then you have FREAKN CRYSTAL FARMS"
23-11-2018T15:56:24,CrimsonQuill,"That bad, huh?"
23-11-2018T15:56:27,SageSaga,or Gwaltney for hot dogs
23-11-2018T15:56:47,SageSaga,have you ever had a gwaltney hot dog?
23-11-2018T15:56:56,CrimsonQuill,Nope.
23-11-2018T15:57:01,CrimsonQuill,I don't live in the US.
23-11-2018T15:57:02,SageSaga,keep it that way
23-11-2018T15:57:07,CrimsonQuill,Will do.
23-11-2018T15:57:16,CrimsonQuill,I prefer Crott's Sausage Rolls.
23-11-2018T15:57:23,CrimsonQuill,THOSE are worth having.
23-11-2018T15:57:41,SageSaga,there's a reason they sell em for like a dollar for a package of 8 hotdogs
23-11-2018T15:58:14,CrimsonQuill,Crotty's Sausage rolls are just lots of Sausage meat wrapped in pastry.
23-11-2018T15:58:40,CrimsonQuill,I think you pay about 10 euro for five of them.
23-11-2018T15:58:43,CrimsonQuill,or four.
23-11-2018T15:58:51,CrimsonQuill,But they're worth it.
23-11-2018T15:59:23,FoxxTrotter,Gwaltney is one of those generic frank brands. We have them here.
23-11-2018T15:59:25,SageSaga,sounds good but i cant eat bread
23-11-2018T15:59:48,CrimsonQuill,Like a Keidran then. They can't eat bread either.
23-11-2018T15:59:56,FoxxTrotter,Carolina Packers is one of the better local ones here.
23-11-2018T16:00:23,CrimsonQuill,I don't really know that stuff.
23-11-2018T16:00:41,CrimsonQuill,The fact that i don't live in he US is the reason i can't head to Comic con yet.
23-11-2018T16:00:51,SageSaga,Nathan's hot dogs are some of the best
23-11-2018T16:01:00,FoxxTrotter,"I like Zweigle's, too, but they don't have those down here."
23-11-2018T16:01:04,Bgrmystr2,"there's good news for you, Quill"
23-11-2018T16:01:11,Bgrmystr2,there's this invention that's been around for a little while
23-11-2018T16:01:13,CrimsonQuill,I'm praying that you (SageSaga and Tom) will still be at SDCC when I finally go there.
23-11-2018T16:01:16,Bgrmystr2,it's called the airplane.
23-11-2018T16:01:23,CrimsonQuill,And flights are VERY expensive.
23-11-2018T16:01:24,Bgrmystr2,and you can fly to other places in the world.
23-11-2018T16:01:29,SageSaga,ive never been to SDCC
23-11-2018T16:01:30,CrimsonQuill,I'm on a budget.
23-11-2018T16:01:35,CrimsonQuill,Oh?
23-11-2018T16:01:37,CrimsonQuill,Ok
23-11-2018T16:01:41,Bgrmystr2,not really? you can get some really cheap flights
23-11-2018T16:01:57,Bgrmystr2,they're not all like $1000+
23-11-2018T16:02:05,CrimsonQuill,"Cheapest flight from where I am in the SDCC season, return is 800 euro."
23-11-2018T16:02:31,CrimsonQuill,"And that's not including tickets,"
23-11-2018T16:02:44,CrimsonQuill,I'd only be there to see the Keenspot Booth anyhow.
23-11-2018T16:02:53,CrimsonQuill,But I really want to go!
23-11-2018T16:02:59,Bgrmystr2,"gotta check the right flights. they have some where you literally just bring you and that's it. no luggage, but it's super cheap"
23-11-2018T16:03:04,Bgrmystr2,last I checked less than $150
23-11-2018T16:03:20,SageSaga,from another country?
23-11-2018T16:03:48,Bgrmystr2,"when I read about it, it was a worldwide thing"
23-11-2018T16:04:06,Bgrmystr2,but it's been years since then so I don't recall what it was called
23-11-2018T16:04:35,CrimsonQuill,"I'll simply say that, being in Europe, flights are not cheap to the US."
23-11-2018T16:05:21,CrimsonQuill,I really want to go to Keenspot though.
23-11-2018T16:05:27,SageSaga,why?
23-11-2018T16:05:52,CrimsonQuill,"Basically to meet Tom Fischbach and Jon Joesco, and to just see what it's like."
23-11-2018T16:06:07,CrimsonQuill,"And you, if you're there"
23-11-2018T16:06:19,SageSaga,well it's easier to meet Tom at another con than Comicon
23-11-2018T16:06:28,CrimsonQuill,What cons?
23-11-2018T16:06:57,SageSaga,well next year we are going to Anthrocon
23-11-2018T16:07:16,CrimsonQuill,Not sure I can go to that either
23-11-2018T16:07:28,CrimsonQuill,That's the problem with udgets
23-11-2018T16:07:30,CrimsonQuill,budgets
23-11-2018T16:07:32,SageSaga,it's in a much cheaper area
23-11-2018T16:07:46,CrimsonQuill,hmmmm....
23-11-2018T16:07:49,SageSaga,Tom doesnt generally like SDCC all that much
23-11-2018T16:07:58,CrimsonQuill,Crowded?
23-11-2018T16:08:11,FoxxTrotter,"Yeah, it's on the east coast instead of the west coast. Less length to travel from Europe."
23-11-2018T16:08:24,CrimsonQuill,huh.
23-11-2018T16:08:24,SageSaga,no one goes to SDCC for smaller comic artists
23-11-2018T16:08:31,SageSaga,heck they barely go for comics at all anymore
23-11-2018T16:08:34,CrimsonQuill,I'd be the exception.
23-11-2018T16:08:45,CrimsonQuill,But maybe I might give Anthro con a go...
23-11-2018T16:08:48,CrimsonQuill,some day...
23-11-2018T16:09:05,CrimsonQuill,It'd just be a day trip and back either way.
23-11-2018T16:09:14,CrimsonQuill,My course has a lot of wprk.
23-11-2018T16:09:17,CrimsonQuill,work
23-11-2018T16:09:57,FoxxTrotter,"ACE is coming up here in January, which is 45 minutes from me, and I probably won't be able to go to that. XP"
23-11-2018T16:10:08,FoxxTrotter,"I'm only working one job now, so less money."
23-11-2018T16:10:27,CrimsonQuill,I'm doing a four year course in Surveying.
23-11-2018T16:16:16,CrimsonQuill,"Well, i'm heading to bed. Goodnight all! :ptv-greetings::ptv-greetings:"
23-11-2018T16:16:23,FoxxTrotter,"G'night, Crimson."
23-11-2018T16:22:25,SageSaga,gnight
23-11-2018T16:29:25,Bgrmystr2,And here I thought Tom would be streaming the comic today. :ptv-wondering:
23-11-2018T16:29:37,Twokinds,"I'm working on it right now, but there hasn't been enough time"
23-11-2018T16:29:43,Bgrmystr2,aah
23-11-2018T16:30:07,Twokinds,"I keep trying to wake up earlier, but I always end up getting up around noon no matter what"
23-11-2018T16:30:20,Twokinds,There's never enough time
23-11-2018T16:30:59,Bgrmystr2,:(
23-11-2018T16:31:08,Bgrmystr2,"well at least you're workin on the page, that's good"
23-11-2018T16:31:56,Bgrmystr2,this song is so star-wars like sage
23-11-2018T16:32:04,Bgrmystr2,every time I hear it
23-11-2018T16:32:07,Twokinds,It's especially hard during winter because there's just no sun
23-11-2018T16:32:13,Twokinds,Except when I don't want it
23-11-2018T16:32:24,Twokinds,It's always dark
23-11-2018T16:33:26,Bgrmystr2,"lol, I just close my blinds and keep them closed. then turn on my room light."
23-11-2018T16:33:31,SageSaga,i have blackout curtains
23-11-2018T16:33:51,SageSaga,so i never have any sun - i bask in the glow of my many LED daylight bulbs
23-11-2018T16:33:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,love blackout curtains
23-11-2018T16:34:07,Bgrmystr2,I need some lol
23-11-2018T16:34:29,Bgrmystr2,"but someone who was gonna get them for me didn't get them yet after they said they would, so"
23-11-2018T16:34:31,Bgrmystr2,:u
23-11-2018T16:35:00,iliar,There are lamps that are turned on by timer. It helps to wake up. I use lamp like this and it really works. Waking up when the room is bright is much easier.
23-11-2018T16:36:40,ZRO4825,"Doesn't work for me, I have enough blankets I can completely bury myself from nearly any light source. :P"
23-11-2018T16:37:00,Twokinds,Yeah I'm looking at lamps now
23-11-2018T16:37:06,Dadrobit,Howdy y'all.
23-11-2018T16:37:10,Twokinds,My floor lamp broke months ago and I haven't replace it
23-11-2018T16:37:15,FoxxTrotter,"Hi, Dadrobit."
23-11-2018T16:37:19,Dadrobit,Happy B-Day Sage and Zro.
23-11-2018T16:37:45,SageSaga,ty
23-11-2018T16:38:42,SageSaga,and Tom - Amazon? Black Friday? do they sell good lamps? XD
23-11-2018T16:38:53,ZRO4825,ty Dadro ^^
23-11-2018T16:39:06,Twokinds,I don't know?
23-11-2018T16:41:04,Bgrmystr2,heya dadro
23-11-2018T16:43:41,SageSaga,we need a lamp reviewer
23-11-2018T16:44:04,Dadrobit,Work laptop took a catastrophic shit on me. Just got back from leaving it at a shop. Hoping it won't be overly expensive.
23-11-2018T16:44:28,SageSaga,should have asked us first
23-11-2018T16:44:55,Dadrobit,I did what I could. 98% certain the SSD failed.
23-11-2018T16:45:10,Dadrobit,Backed up what I could and eventually resorted to a factory reset.
23-11-2018T16:45:18,SageSaga,i assume you went into the bios then?
23-11-2018T16:45:28,Dadrobit,Still wasn't working properly.
23-11-2018T16:45:50,SageSaga,SSD wouldnt affect the bios
23-11-2018T16:46:23,Dadrobit,"Nah, didn't really touch the bios aside from getting to the factory reset option."
23-11-2018T16:47:03,SageSaga,plus side- SSDs are really cheap right now
23-11-2018T16:47:35,SageSaga,and i dont mean for black friday- i mean production ramped up a few months back and their price overall has dropped a lot
23-11-2018T16:47:50,Dadrobit,"Oh, I was saying that the factory reset didn't fix the computer's issues. Not that it wasn't fixing the bios. That was working fine enough."
23-11-2018T16:49:03,Dadrobit,"And yeah, they're way less expensive than what they were even 5-6 years ago."
23-11-2018T16:49:37,Dadrobit,Like waaaaay cheaper lol. Shit was almost prohibitively expensive.
23-11-2018T16:50:17,SageSaga,yeah- even the newer nvme SSDs are cheap
23-11-2018T16:50:25,SageSaga,and those things are awesome
23-11-2018T16:51:02,ZRO4825,Caught a WD Black M.2 NVMe for $99. Steeeaaaal <3
23-11-2018T16:51:17,SageSaga,size?
23-11-2018T16:51:18,ZRO4825,:thinking: I think it was NVMe
23-11-2018T16:51:20,ZRO4825,500GB
23-11-2018T16:51:36,ZRO4825,"Yeah, NVMe"
23-11-2018T16:51:41,SageSaga,nice
23-11-2018T16:52:38,SageSaga,not too long ago those were 340 bucks
23-11-2018T16:52:55,ZRO4825,"Yeah, I was looking at a Blue for like $130 and was like ""Oh, not a bad deal."""
23-11-2018T16:53:25,ZRO4825,"Then I was looking around randomly checking stats comparisons and prices and stumbled on that Black. Was half the space by comparison, but ye gods the speed difference was worth."
23-11-2018T16:53:37,Bgrmystr2,xD yeah
23-11-2018T16:53:49,SageSaga,WD Black Drives are their performance drives
23-11-2018T16:54:17,Bgrmystr2,"it was WD blue ssd to a black M.2 drive though, wasn't it?"
23-11-2018T16:54:37,Bgrmystr2,just ssd to m.2 is crazy in performance
23-11-2018T16:54:59,Twokinds,I really need a new pc one day
23-11-2018T16:55:00,Bgrmystr2,nevermind the blue to black difference
23-11-2018T16:55:17,Twokinds,That can support stuff like that.
23-11-2018T16:55:37,SageSaga,ya know Mihari will build you a PC
23-11-2018T16:57:12,SageSaga,video cards are a bit of an issue atm though
23-11-2018T16:57:57,SageSaga,"the best video card for ""Consumers"" atm is way overpriced and the second best has stopped being produced"
23-11-2018T16:59:45,SageSaga,currently the best videocard still available and for its price is probably the GTX 1070ti
23-11-2018T17:00:22,SageSaga,the 1080ti is the one they stopped making so its harder to get now and its price is going up
23-11-2018T17:00:51,SageSaga,because the replacement -the 2080 is not really good and super expensive - and the 2080ti is amazing - but crazy expensive
23-11-2018T17:01:55,Bgrmystr2,Zro was finding 2080s for cheaper than 2080tis yesterday or whatnot
23-11-2018T17:02:19,Dadrobit,Still chugging along on my old RX 480. I don't particularly do a ton of hardcore PC gaming honestly. Mostly just stick to my PS4.
23-11-2018T17:02:24,SageSaga,all 2080s are cheaper than 2080tis
23-11-2018T17:02:38,Bgrmystr2,..1080ti*
23-11-2018T17:02:41,Bgrmystr2,not 2080ti
23-11-2018T17:02:47,Bgrmystr2,fingers are being stupid
23-11-2018T17:03:13,SageSaga,and of course 2080's are being sold cheaper than 1080ti's- 1080ti's are better and arent being made anymore
23-11-2018T17:03:25,SageSaga,no one wants 2080's atm
23-11-2018T17:04:34,RimaDraws,back from the movies. having a good bday sage?
23-11-2018T17:04:36,SageSaga,the 2070's seem ok but they havent been heavily tested yet
23-11-2018T17:04:53,SageSaga,its been ok- my father forgot it was my birthday though
23-11-2018T17:04:58,RimaDraws,ouch
23-11-2018T17:05:05,Dadrobit,:/
23-11-2018T17:05:23,RimaDraws,maybe he was busy he forgot...
23-11-2018T17:05:25,RimaDraws,my mom did that
23-11-2018T17:05:43,SageSaga,XD my father isnt busy
23-11-2018T17:05:54,RimaDraws,well you think as parents they'd remember
23-11-2018T17:06:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"gotta run, happy birthday Sage and Zro <3"
23-11-2018T17:06:04,SageSaga,he's retired- he does nothing

23-11-2018T17:13:45,Dadrobit,"I hope so, I'm actually quite looking forward to it!"

23-11-2018T17:16:31,Dadrobit,For sure. One cousin out in NY is like 24 now and getting married. I still recall her waddling into my room with her stuffed bear crying about nightmares so long ago.
23-11-2018T17:16:31,SageSaga,"my mother just came in and wished me a happy birthday and then said ""Good lord that girl is bouncing again!"""

23-11-2018T17:17:52,SageSaga,I told her it's an animated gif- it never stops bouncing

23-11-2018T18:21:44,Bgrmystr2,"Don't worry kiwi, just keep adding more cakes with the same amount of candles. eventually you'll have enough. :birthday::birthday::birthday::birthday:"
23-11-2018T18:21:50,FoxxTrotter,"C-ya, Sage."

23-11-2018T18:25:05,SpazztasticKiwi,..I’d post 34 candles but that’s a bit much
23-11-2018T18:25:25,SpazztasticKiwi,How about just one big bonfire? 🔥

23-11-2018T18:27:08,Twokinds,Yeah you shouldn't put more than 33 candles on a cake
23-11-2018T18:27:29,Bgrmystr2,just get a bigger cake.
23-11-2018T18:30:23,RimaDraws,🔥🔥🔥🔥💥

23-11-2018T18:30:41,Bgrmystr2,That last one is not a candle
23-11-2018T18:31:43,RimaDraws,So
23-11-2018T18:32:21,Dadrobit,Roman Candle
23-11-2018T18:32:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok. So it is determined: none of you are allowed to age past 33
23-11-2018T18:32:58,Twokinds,Yes!
23-11-2018T18:33:06,Twokinds,We'll call it rule 34

23-11-2018T18:33:27,SpazztasticKiwi,:ptv-unimpressed:
23-11-2018T18:33:29,RimaDraws,Aw only three more years
23-11-2018T18:33:40,Bgrmystr2,"goddamn if I don't give that one a +1, tom"
23-11-2018T18:33:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I still got about a decade
23-11-2018T18:34:43,SpazztasticKiwi,But this rule means you’re on thin ice Tom
23-11-2018T18:35:34,Dadrobit,"... How far ahead were you planning that, Tom?"
23-11-2018T18:35:53,SpazztasticKiwi,The joke or his life?
23-11-2018T18:36:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause I’m pretty sure he’s wining both
23-11-2018T18:36:07,SpazztasticKiwi,winging
23-11-2018T18:36:22,Twokinds,"I'll be honest, I've been waiting for the perfect moment for a while now..."

23-11-2018T18:37:09,SpazztasticKiwi,":ctwokinds-flomad:”Gimme an opening. Just one. Come oooon, I got a joke to let loose”"
23-11-2018T18:37:29,Twokinds,Pretty much
23-11-2018T18:39:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don’t know what happened to these cookies they just put in the break room from the floor, but it looks like the packages went through a tumble dry cycle"
23-11-2018T18:40:38,Dadrobit,Did they also leave wrinkle control on?
23-11-2018T18:46:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Well some of the cookies are in crumbs. And most of the plastic trays are cracked to pieces
23-11-2018T18:46:09,SpazztasticKiwi,So....I dunno
23-11-2018T18:46:35,Xexanoth,still cookies though
23-11-2018T18:46:43,Xexanoth,so i'm not sure what the problem is
23-11-2018T18:47:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"It’s not a problem, no. Just something to share"
23-11-2018T18:47:52,RimaDraws,I would eat them but god knows how much  is left
23-11-2018T18:47:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Like the fact I must now return to closing
23-11-2018T18:48:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Lunch is over. But hopefully we’ll get done on time and I’ll get home
23-11-2018T18:48:36,SpazztasticKiwi,✌🏻
23-11-2018T18:48:52,Dadrobit,Apply milk directly to the cookie crumbbs.
23-11-2018T18:48:58,Dadrobit,crumbs*
23-11-2018T19:05:16,RimaDraws,Woo
23-11-2018T19:23:46,unsteddyphoenix,"Happy birthday Sage, if youre here!"
23-11-2018T19:23:49,unsteddyphoenix,Also hi
23-11-2018T19:37:58,RimaDraws,Hi
23-11-2018T20:19:51,Dadrobit,Thank fuck I learned to back things up externally.
23-11-2018T20:20:57,Dadrobit,Trying to re-install some audio stuff on a different back-up laptop and I thought I lost a bunch of hobby audio post-production stuff.
23-11-2018T20:21:22,Dadrobit,Just blanked that I keep all that on a separate external drive.
23-11-2018T20:21:48,Dadrobit,"Wasn't 100% up to date, so I think I probably lost a teensy bit of data. But it's something."
23-11-2018T20:22:40,Dadrobit,Too many hours have gone into that silly Norman Feetus Death Stranding trailer. That'd be a feelsbadman to lose that work.
23-11-2018T20:25:30,CommanderTrace,Happy Birthday Sage:grinning:
23-11-2018T20:27:12,unsteddyphoenix,Hows that going by the way?
23-11-2018T20:29:15,Dadrobit,Stalled 100% after this morning. But otherwise it's just a lot of tinkering that's doing before I'm totally satisfied.
23-11-2018T20:29:51,Dadrobit,Dunno if you were around/saw. But my workstation took a dump on me. It's in the shop at the moment.
23-11-2018T20:30:43,Dadrobit,"So I'm effectively unemployable until I either get this back-up laptop to a working state, or I get my actual laptop back and then get that back in order."
23-11-2018T20:31:17,unsteddyphoenix,"Oh yikes, that's extremely problematic"
23-11-2018T20:31:28,unsteddyphoenix,Whats the repair ETA?
23-11-2018T20:31:58,Dadrobit,"DAWs are so unbelievably finicky with having proper drivers and being totally up to date, I've been working on getting this laptop working for like 3 hours."
23-11-2018T20:32:38,Dadrobit,"Dunno. The shop closes early on Saturday, and takes Sunday off. So I probably won't get it back until late Monday or Tuesday."
23-11-2018T20:33:48,unsteddyphoenix,Well...
23-11-2018T20:33:55,unsteddyphoenix,Sounds like youre gonna be bored for a while~
23-11-2018T20:37:46,Dadrobit,Fuck that. I'm getting this laptop running something. Fucking Audacity will work if it's the last thing I do.
23-11-2018T20:37:52,Dadrobit,But I'm getting paid.
23-11-2018T20:38:20,RimaDraws,What I miss
23-11-2018T20:40:41,Dadrobit,"While I have the other things downloading though, I'm actually about to head out for dinner."
23-11-2018T20:42:46,unsteddyphoenix,whatcha gettin?
23-11-2018T20:43:51,Dadrobit,Expensive Italian. Grandma's treat. Reservations and everything.
23-11-2018T20:44:12,Dadrobit,Reservations I'm about to miss. So ta ta for now.
23-11-2018T20:44:24,unsteddyphoenix,ooo~
23-11-2018T20:44:25,unsteddyphoenix,have fun
23-11-2018T20:46:21,RimaDraws,Sounds good
23-11-2018T21:26:54,SpazztasticKiwi,Power at work jwe my out
23-11-2018T21:27:07,SpazztasticKiwi,just went
23-11-2018T21:27:16,SpazztasticKiwi,And it keeps flickering
23-11-2018T21:35:57,Bgrmystr2,that's not good
23-11-2018T22:12:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Well we’re all waiting around at the front till it comes back
23-11-2018T22:13:26,SpazztasticKiwi,You should’ve seen the customers. They just pulled out their phones and kept shopping
23-11-2018T22:43:23,SpazztasticKiwi,They’ve let me go home. But as far as an update: a transformer behind the store 💥
23-11-2018T22:43:37,Bgrmystr2,"ooo, that explains"
23-11-2018T22:44:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Explains the small pop noise too
23-11-2018T23:05:08,Dadrobit,Aaaaand back.
23-11-2018T23:06:17,Dadrobit,Computer wants one more (at least) restart and I think I'll have it working on Reaper instead of Pro Tools.
23-11-2018T23:07:37,Dadrobit,"All my licensing is stuck on my dead laptop, and I can only go through the recovery process once a year, so I'll unfortunately not have my fancy post-production software stuffs."
23-11-2018T23:08:42,CrRAR,Not even with a call to support?
23-11-2018T23:09:19,Dadrobit,Maaaaaybe?
23-11-2018T23:10:00,CrRAR,jus' sweettalk 'em real gud
23-11-2018T23:10:13,CrRAR,"also, wb"
23-11-2018T23:11:50,Dadrobit,The company I do business with is real particular about their software licenses. My account probably has $5k worth of licenses attached to it and it all has to run through their proprietary management systems.
23-11-2018T23:12:28,Bgrmystr2,wouldn't that make you a valuable customer for them..?
23-11-2018T23:12:33,CrRAR,^
23-11-2018T23:13:01,Dadrobit,Although I did recently sweet talk them over on Black Friday. About $4k of that I got reduced to $190.
23-11-2018T23:13:06,Dadrobit,So maybe.
23-11-2018T23:13:14,CrRAR,niiice
23-11-2018T23:13:21,Bgrmystr2,god damn
23-11-2018T23:14:12,Dadrobit,"It was a bundled suite that was on sale for $420. But I already had some of the bundled software, so when I contacted them about it, they said, ""Here, how 'bout this price?"""
23-11-2018T23:14:23,Dadrobit,Yes fucking please.
23-11-2018T23:15:24,RimaDraws,oooh wow
