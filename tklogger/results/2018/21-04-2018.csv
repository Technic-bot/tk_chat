21-04-2018T02:07:58,SilliconeCarbide,so anybody else suprised that zen can see youngtani? i kinda figured she was like natanis subconscious
21-04-2018T02:08:16,SilliconeCarbide,guess headspace just got a new resident
21-04-2018T02:27:58,Bgrmystr2,I'm not. They're literally connected mentally
21-04-2018T02:28:03,Bgrmystr2,why would he not see her? lol
21-04-2018T02:28:37,SilliconeCarbide,kinda had the impression she was just natanis imagination playing tricks
21-04-2018T02:28:51,SilliconeCarbide,was wrong obviously though
21-04-2018T02:29:10,SilliconeCarbide,but does this mean that youngtani has her own will?
21-04-2018T02:29:13,Bgrmystr2,"natani would have to actively attempt to block Zen from meeting the young version of her, and I don't know if she could, considering that's what's left of natani pre-mind fusion from what it seems like"
21-04-2018T02:29:35,SilliconeCarbide,"like if she wants to chat with zen, can oldtani just block that?"
21-04-2018T02:29:41,Bgrmystr2,I dunno about her own will
21-04-2018T02:29:55,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, it's just part of Natani."
21-04-2018T02:30:21,Bgrmystr2,it just depends on how the spell works
21-04-2018T02:30:28,Bgrmystr2,which we don't have many details on
21-04-2018T02:30:31,Bgrmystr2,so :u
21-04-2018T02:30:32,SilliconeCarbide,true
21-04-2018T02:30:51,SilliconeCarbide,guess if youngtani has her own will and can do things without oldtanis interference
21-04-2018T02:31:02,SilliconeCarbide,this would be like living with a really noisy upstairs neighbour
21-04-2018T02:38:28,Vatruvius,What you are suggesting Sillicone would mean youngNatani could make effective decisions which she cannot. YoungNatani and oldNatani are basically two parts of the currentNatani. So in this head space both should appear because they are the two parts that
21-04-2018T02:38:37,Vatruvius,form currentNatani.
21-04-2018T02:39:18,Vatruvius,"It may be that in the future these two parts will merge into one, as of right now Natani is still getting use to discovering her pre-fusion fragment."
21-04-2018T02:41:32,Bgrmystr2,the reason they're separate is because natani closed off any and all ideas of being female
21-04-2018T02:41:36,Bgrmystr2,into this shell
21-04-2018T02:42:06,Bgrmystr2,and then hid from it for her entire life since the mind fusion thing
21-04-2018T02:43:00,Bgrmystr2,"so until natani actually accepts that she still has a female side, there's gonna be two Natani"
21-04-2018T02:43:11,Bgrmystr2,interesting it took this long for youngtani to actually appear
21-04-2018T02:43:20,Bgrmystr2,"probably Keith, if I had to guess."
21-04-2018T02:43:34,Vatruvius,It will be interesting to see how these two parts will interact and influence Natani's decisions and personality. Clearly after discovering her younger fragment she has embraced a more feminine outlook to certain relationships like with Keith. Though not
21-04-2018T02:43:47,Vatruvius,"entirely, it is there a little bit."
21-04-2018T02:44:19,Bgrmystr2,yeh I think keith really helped allow natani to feel more comfortable being herself and not having to hide behind that male shell
21-04-2018T02:44:37,Bgrmystr2,which I guess helped youngtani come out :v
21-04-2018T02:45:02,Vatruvius,It will be a huge change though if Natani was to adopt a female outlook from young Natani.
21-04-2018T02:45:20,Bgrmystr2,I dunno if it'd be a huge change
21-04-2018T02:45:43,Bgrmystr2,youngtani doesn't have a 100% female outlook either. She is a tomboy
21-04-2018T02:46:09,Vatruvius,What really triggered yountNatani to come out was the separation of the mind link with Zen from that anklet thing.
21-04-2018T02:46:32,Bgrmystr2,"that was the last straw, I think, but not the direct cause of it"
21-04-2018T02:46:53,Vatruvius,"This is true, but youngNatani does recognize herself as female but liking being seen as male."
21-04-2018T02:47:23,Bgrmystr2,"if natani wasn't actually feeling more comfortable being herself around keith, I don't think youngtani would have been there when she was disconnected from Zen"
21-04-2018T02:47:32,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, maybe but"
21-04-2018T02:47:45,Bgrmystr2,I don't know if it would have been the same story
21-04-2018T02:48:36,Bgrmystr2,Natani wouldn't have been conflicted enough for youngtani to appear without Keith being a love interest
21-04-2018T02:48:45,Vatruvius,"Maybe not, youngNatani did influence currentNatani's personality to rely less on Zen's personality and be her own person."
21-04-2018T02:49:20,Vatruvius,Perhaps.
21-04-2018T02:50:51,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I don't really know how Natani's mind works or how much of a shell she put up, but obviously She was conflicted about being male and female at the same time, keith being there to help Natani relax without the stress of hiding, and suddenly"
21-04-2018T02:51:03,Vatruvius,Augh...I am just listening to some instrumental/mood music while also rereading the comic for the eighth time and now I really want to go back to working on my D&D world filling it out. Probably would be a better way to spend my time than gaming.
21-04-2018T02:51:05,Bgrmystr2,"being unconscious, can't talk to keith, and can't talk to zen either"
21-04-2018T02:51:41,Bgrmystr2,being disconnected from zen was a proper right hook out of nowhere
21-04-2018T02:51:45,Vatruvius,"Yeah, definitely multiple factors played into Natani's current situation."
21-04-2018T02:52:45,SilliconeCarbide,so basically every action natani takes is a consensus between youngtani and oldtani?
21-04-2018T02:52:48,SilliconeCarbide,something like that?
21-04-2018T02:52:55,Vatruvius,Not at all.
21-04-2018T02:53:33,Vatruvius,More like the two parts have an influence. One part tends to have more control of influence than the other.
21-04-2018T02:53:43,SilliconeCarbide,mh
21-04-2018T02:53:48,Vatruvius,Think of it as it was described in the comic.
21-04-2018T02:54:08,Vatruvius,When Natani's soul was shattered Zen gave part of his to fill the cracks.
21-04-2018T02:54:57,Vatruvius,This new version did away with youngNatain and became a person on their own with internal conflicts.
21-04-2018T02:56:10,Vatruvius,"Now, youngNatani is back so those two parts, what was left of youngNatani and everything else manifested into two parts basically. So each really only has control or influence what part of Natani's character they replaced."
21-04-2018T02:56:33,SilliconeCarbide,oof
21-04-2018T02:58:06,Vatruvius,"As an example, youngNatani has a feminine outlook to romantic relationships which shows through with currentNatani with Keith, that was something Zen's soul did not replace or fill."
21-04-2018T02:58:38,SilliconeCarbide,and it bled into natanis character as a whole in that mansion scene i guess
21-04-2018T03:00:00,Vatruvius,"Basically, view youngNatani as a light that was turned on after she came back from that whole mind separation thing at the ship. Now both parts are active where as before it was just maleNatani."
21-04-2018T03:00:31,SilliconeCarbide,i wonder how zen would interact with youngtani
21-04-2018T03:00:39,Vatruvius,Deep down youngNatani was always there just never really present due to current circumstances.
21-04-2018T03:00:40,SilliconeCarbide,obviously they were close
21-04-2018T03:01:12,Vatruvius,"That  will be a serious blow because now he has to deal with two siblings, a sister and brother, that are the same yet different."
21-04-2018T03:01:41,SilliconeCarbide,youngtani seemed less defensive tho
21-04-2018T03:01:56,SilliconeCarbide,"paired with zens easy attitude, i could see them get along great"
21-04-2018T03:01:58,Vatruvius,"No doubt, having thought he lost his young sister made him hurt inside seeing that the soul sharing forever changed Natani. In essence, he did lose is sister forever."
21-04-2018T03:03:18,Vatruvius,"For right now, Natani is fragmented into these two parts, but it is likely that these two parts will merge into the final character/personality that will be Natani given time."
21-04-2018T03:03:33,SilliconeCarbide,looking forward to that
21-04-2018T03:06:15,SilliconeCarbide,most of the audience here is american yes?
21-04-2018T03:06:25,Twokinds,Except me
21-04-2018T03:06:34,SilliconeCarbide,you are? :&gt;
21-04-2018T03:06:37,SilliconeCarbide,i mean
21-04-2018T03:06:39,SilliconeCarbide,where are you from
21-04-2018T03:06:56,Twokinds,Twokindia
21-04-2018T03:07:02,SilliconeCarbide,of course
21-04-2018T03:07:05,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
21-04-2018T03:07:18,Vatruvius,"He is 100% American, I think Tom was saying he is not looking forward to the Natani character merge? No comment?"
21-04-2018T03:07:44,Vatruvius,"And what are you doing up at this time Tom, it is late for you!"
21-04-2018T03:08:10,Bgrmystr2,tom does tend to stay up a few hours after he stops streaming late in the morning so
21-04-2018T03:08:16,Bgrmystr2,it's not out of the ordinary for him to be up at this time
21-04-2018T03:08:52,Bgrmystr2,4am is pretty well into the night though
21-04-2018T03:08:53,Vatruvius,"But, this is not a stream day Bgr. Well, technically it is now but he was not streaming today so he is just up because?"
21-04-2018T03:08:59,Bgrmystr2,Would it really matter tho?
21-04-2018T03:09:26,SilliconeCarbide,changing sleeping habits is hard
21-04-2018T03:09:40,Bgrmystr2,It's not like he changes his sleep schedule like 3 or 4 hours just cuz he streamed one or two days of the week lol
21-04-2018T03:09:42,Vatruvius,"I guess not, but he should get to bed if he plans to stream at 4 which is in 12 hours. He still has to edit and type in all the suggestions."
21-04-2018T03:09:42,Bgrmystr2,xD
21-04-2018T03:10:18,Bgrmystr2,He'll prolly be goin to bed in.. :thinking: 1 or 2 hrs if I would hazard a guess.
21-04-2018T03:10:22,Vatruvius,"Unless that is what he is doing right now, though that would be an early time to enter them in?"
21-04-2018T03:10:25,Bgrmystr2,based on what I've seen
21-04-2018T03:10:51,Bgrmystr2,naw he does it before the sunday stream starts
21-04-2018T03:11:01,Bgrmystr2,so ppl can vote all through the night and through sun morning
21-04-2018T03:11:09,SilliconeCarbide,he would prolly miss lots of suggestions  were he to type them in now
21-04-2018T03:11:10,Bgrmystr2,right up till the stream begins people can vote
21-04-2018T03:11:12,Vatruvius,"I cannot live like that, it would be too hard on me. But I have school and stuff so, I do not have a hobby that I love that pays for everything. Maybe one day..."
21-04-2018T03:12:01,Bgrmystr2,Sleepin at 4-5am and waking up at like noon?
21-04-2018T03:12:03,Bgrmystr2,that's hard?
21-04-2018T03:12:12,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
21-04-2018T03:12:31,Bgrmystr2,pretty standard amount of sleep time imo
21-04-2018T03:12:34,Vatruvius,That sleeping pattern would be hard on me for a few reasons and I did use to have a sleep schedule like that.
21-04-2018T03:12:51,SilliconeCarbide,"depends i guess, feeling tired is stressfull"
21-04-2018T03:12:59,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, if you didn't have to wake up in the morning for anything, it wouldn't matter"
21-04-2018T03:13:06,Bgrmystr2,tis why I sort of have the same schedule tom does.
21-04-2018T03:13:43,Vatruvius,"With school and stuff I would be sleep deprived because I cannot sleep into noon on school days. Second, I am a sunshine person. If a significant portion of my up time was at night I would not do well."
21-04-2018T03:14:21,Bgrmystr2,school makes the schedule moot xD
21-04-2018T03:14:25,Bgrmystr2,cuz it's in the morning
21-04-2018T03:15:06,Bgrmystr2,"I do pretty easily morning or night, whatever. Doesn't matter to me. I've slept literally every time zone on the planet lol"
21-04-2018T03:15:09,Vatruvius,Like right now it is 1:15AM which is pushing it for me. I can only really do this on weekends when I have absolutely nothing going on the next day.
21-04-2018T03:15:55,Vatruvius,"I have yet to pull an all nighter, for some reason that is a source of pride for me."
21-04-2018T03:16:16,Bgrmystr2,"atm the only things that I gotta worry about happen after 2pm for me, so I don't need to wake up in the morning.. usually I only need to wake up for 3pm on sunday.."
21-04-2018T03:16:31,Bgrmystr2,rest of the week is prettymuch whatever time my body rolls outta bed
21-04-2018T03:16:58,Bgrmystr2,"unless someone streams early, but I hear the notifier on my browser"
21-04-2018T03:17:40,SilliconeCarbide,"last year when i was at a conference in austria, i stayed awake for almost 48h due to business reasons"
21-04-2018T03:17:41,SilliconeCarbide,that was hell
21-04-2018T03:17:51,SilliconeCarbide,i never felt that exhausted in my life
21-04-2018T03:19:02,Vatruvius,I am looking forward to getting my laptop repaired. I have decided to ship it off Monday no exceptions. I want to be able to play the other 95% of the games I own not to mention some of them are getting really cool updates right now.
21-04-2018T03:19:50,Vatruvius,"Pair that with typing in this chat, there are a surprising number of words/names I use that have the letters ""x"" and ""z"" in them."
21-04-2018T03:21:03,Vatruvius,Spellcheck does not seem to understand what I am trying to say without these letters in most words.
21-04-2018T03:21:28,SilliconeCarbide,your x and z are broken?
21-04-2018T03:22:21,Vatruvius,"Yup, had to pull up the virtual keyboard to type those. That and my CTRL key is broken as well. Completely unresponsive, have been for three or four weeks now."
21-04-2018T03:22:34,SilliconeCarbide,well that sucks
21-04-2018T03:23:35,Vatruvius,"Yeah, it is weird that those keys went out because compared to other keys I use in games these should be more mid-life while my ""w"" or ""r"" key should be out."
21-04-2018T03:24:12,Vatruvius,"I mean, I even wore the paint out on my ""s"" key and that works just fine."
21-04-2018T03:24:35,SilliconeCarbide,ha my s key's paint is worn out as well
21-04-2018T03:24:42,SilliconeCarbide,but all my keys are fine
21-04-2018T03:24:53,SilliconeCarbide,"kinda weird, i never had a key break through wear and tear"
21-04-2018T03:25:13,SilliconeCarbide,:X
21-04-2018T03:25:13,SilliconeCarbide,"i did break keyboards the old fashioned way though, using cola or some other beverage"
21-04-2018T03:25:17,Vatruvius,"That is what I am saying though, the keys that are broken are really not that worn compared to many others."
21-04-2018T03:25:46,SilliconeCarbide,yeah thats weird
21-04-2018T03:25:46,Vatruvius,I have never spilled any beverage on my computer.
21-04-2018T03:27:19,Vatruvius,"I should be getting to bed, good night everyone! Good night Tom!"
21-04-2018T03:27:24,SilliconeCarbide,byebye
21-04-2018T03:27:29,Vatruvius,:ptv-greetings:
21-04-2018T03:32:00,Twokinds,G'night!
21-04-2018T03:32:08,Twokinds,I should get to bed too if I want to be awake in time for the Sunday Stream
21-04-2018T03:33:20,SilliconeCarbide,yeah we wouldnt want you too miss that :&gt;
21-04-2018T03:33:24,SilliconeCarbide,byebye
21-04-2018T03:33:57,Bgrmystr2,gnight vatru
21-04-2018T03:34:14,Bgrmystr2,I'll be awake for the stream on sun even if I end up sleeping at 6am..
21-04-2018T03:34:40,Bgrmystr2,"90% of the time, I catch the sunday stream on time, every time :v"
21-04-2018T03:34:47,SilliconeCarbide,so its in the middle of the night for you?
21-04-2018T03:35:13,Bgrmystr2,"it's 3:35am for me, Central Time here"
21-04-2018T03:35:21,SilliconeCarbide,"10:35, germany"

21-04-2018T03:35:30,SilliconeCarbide,ah
21-04-2018T03:35:57,SilliconeCarbide,"for me stream starts late in the evening, 23:00"
21-04-2018T03:36:11,SilliconeCarbide,i usually catch the beginning and watch the rest from vods
21-04-2018T03:37:56,Bgrmystr2,ah 23? that's like 11pm. Not too late. The friday streams start at 9pm so it's not too different for us on that one
21-04-2018T03:38:48,SilliconeCarbide,"yeah its alright, besides i dont have to get up early on saturday"
21-04-2018T03:39:40,SilliconeCarbide,sometimes i just  kim through the sketch vod from sunday on monday morning
21-04-2018T03:39:50,SilliconeCarbide,last week was the first time i submitted a sketch suggestion
21-04-2018T03:40:00,SilliconeCarbide,went into the poll on the first round
21-04-2018T03:40:04,SilliconeCarbide,but got in seconds place
21-04-2018T03:40:41,SilliconeCarbide,monday morning i see that tom picked that suggestion
21-04-2018T03:40:45,SilliconeCarbide,made my day ^^

21-04-2018T13:22:09,Darkewulf,"don't you just love it when your sentence fails to delete properly, and you don't notice it until AFTER you've already typed and sent another message?"
21-04-2018T13:23:33,Darkewulf,"I meant to say, I hope Tom might be able to help me with a question I had about The Dragon Masquerade (relax, no spoilers in the question)"
21-04-2018T13:24:30,Combak,We might be able to answer if you ask.
21-04-2018T13:30:41,WereKeidran,begins lurking
21-04-2018T13:31:47,Darkewulf,"It's something only he would be able to answer, sadly."
21-04-2018T13:32:19,Darkewulf,and I don't have any other means of contacting him
21-04-2018T13:35:06,Combak,Just ask.
21-04-2018T13:35:36,Combak,Especially since now it sounds like a spoiler he definitely won't answer.
21-04-2018T13:35:53,Darkewulf,Fine... do YOU know the pattern he used on Zen's coat?
21-04-2018T13:36:18,Combak,The... pattern?
21-04-2018T13:36:24,Combak,"Like, brush pattern or...?"
21-04-2018T13:36:55,Darkewulf,"no, the very subtle intricate design pattern on the fabric. It's neither Damask nor paisley"
21-04-2018T13:37:00,Darkewulf,but similar to both
21-04-2018T13:37:19,Combak,That's probably just the brush.
21-04-2018T13:37:26,Combak,"But yeah, you'll have to ask Tom."
21-04-2018T13:37:38,Darkewulf,"if you zoom in on the picture of Zen on the back cover, and in the comic itself, you can see there is a faint, seamless texture"
21-04-2018T13:38:39,Darkewulf,"the background in that image is a royalty-free Damask variant I'm rather fond of using myself, but the pattern on the coat is eluding me."
21-04-2018T13:39:51,ProsePro7,..And here I thought I would be the only one on here
21-04-2018T13:40:12,Darkewulf,"That's where you're wrong, kiddo"
21-04-2018T13:40:19,Darkewulf,makes finger funs

21-04-2018T13:45:06,Combak,You're never the only one on here.
21-04-2018T13:45:21,Combak,"Seriously, there's like 10 people that keep this open in a tab."
21-04-2018T13:45:29,WereKeidran,you are never alone
21-04-2018T13:53:28,SilliconeCarbide,but most people are just idling
21-04-2018T13:53:33,Combak,Doodoododo doodoododo...
21-04-2018T13:54:29,Combak,Quiet SiC &gt;.&gt;
21-04-2018T13:54:57,Darkewulf,I'm texturing a 3D model and it's driving me up the wall
21-04-2018T14:00:16,Combak,"Well, at least you don't have to pay for gas."
21-04-2018T14:14:30,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:

21-04-2018T14:22:10,Bgrmystr2,"feels good for me, but okay"
21-04-2018T14:22:16,Bgrmystr2,didn't get enough sleep?
21-04-2018T14:24:02,Bgrmystr2,"I got up like.. 20 mins ago, got bout 8 hr sleep"
21-04-2018T14:25:59,Dadrobit,"Like, close to 11 hours."
21-04-2018T14:26:07,Dadrobit,Got home around midnight last night.
21-04-2018T14:26:37,Bgrmystr2,"jeez, and you still feel bad? you must have had a long day"
21-04-2018T14:28:43,WereKeidran,sometimes too much sleep makes me feel worse than too little
21-04-2018T14:28:46,Dadrobit,Slept too much.
21-04-2018T14:29:10,Dadrobit,"But I was at a con all day yesterday as well, so that was a thing."
21-04-2018T14:29:51,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno if that's a slept too much thing, and more of a body recovering from the convention and it just smacking you later, IE after waking up the next day"
21-04-2018T14:30:37,Bgrmystr2,yer body just kinda.. stops sleeping when it's well rested
21-04-2018T14:31:35,Dadrobit,"It's not like it was a hardcore run around convention or anything lol, I was just playing piball."

21-04-2018T14:36:22,TerraTheWizard,"i see my pfp is still broken, neat"
21-04-2018T14:37:03,Bgrmystr2,heya terra. And why do you say it's broken?
21-04-2018T14:37:47,TerraTheWizard,"i updated it last week, and picarto was a stupid with transparency,"
21-04-2018T14:37:58,TerraTheWizard,"so instead of replacing it, it pasted it over the old one"
21-04-2018T14:38:31,NightMeaty22,has returned

21-04-2018T14:39:03,TerraTheWizard,actually it might only be broken for me :thinking:
21-04-2018T14:39:05,Dadrobit,Brunch one might even say
21-04-2018T14:39:07,Bgrmystr2,"so you can see the old image behind the new one where the transparency should be, Terra?"
21-04-2018T14:39:17,TerraTheWizard,does my pfp have a white smudge on the right side?
21-04-2018T14:39:37,Bgrmystr2,lemmy jump on your channel to get a better look at it
21-04-2018T14:39:53,Combak,Yes
21-04-2018T14:39:53,Bgrmystr2,yeah around her whole head
21-04-2018T14:39:54,NightMeaty22,got my phone back yay
21-04-2018T14:40:05,Bgrmystr2,"left top and right, it wraps all around"
21-04-2018T14:40:31,TerraTheWizard,"yeah, it had my lucario one under it so i uploaded it a second time"
21-04-2018T14:40:31,Combak,Can you use an uncropped version?
21-04-2018T14:40:35,Wyvern088,afternoon all
21-04-2018T14:40:36,TerraTheWizard,that caused the halo effect
21-04-2018T14:40:45,goldgardian,"So, Question."
21-04-2018T14:40:59,Bgrmystr2,"what you can do, Terra, is to make an image of JUST the background color of the chat"
21-04-2018T14:41:03,Mippy,Shoot Gold
21-04-2018T14:41:05,TerraTheWizard,i guess i could just make a version with the chat colo_
21-04-2018T14:41:09,Bgrmystr2,and update your image to that first
21-04-2018T14:41:09,TerraTheWizard,"oh, ya beat me to it"
21-04-2018T14:41:10,TerraTheWizard,lol
21-04-2018T14:41:19,Bgrmystr2,then upload the one w/ the transparent background
21-04-2018T14:41:20,goldgardian,what guild did ze nand Natani first join?
21-04-2018T14:41:27,goldgardian,was it clovis's?
21-04-2018T14:41:50,Bgrmystr2,I would figure making the outside of the image w/ the chat color would be kinda messy
21-04-2018T14:42:05,Vatruvius,They joined the assassin's guild gold.
21-04-2018T14:42:20,Vatruvius,Clovis came in when Natani got hit with that black magic.
21-04-2018T14:43:07,Mippy,"Dang, I'm pretty sure they just joind and unnamed assassin's guild and Clovis just hired them. It's been a while since Ive read Dragon Masquarde"
21-04-2018T14:43:24,goldgardian,"Cool, right then"
21-04-2018T14:44:07,TerraTheWizard,"ok, so i got rid of the picture that was behind, but it still made the halo effect"
21-04-2018T14:44:08,TerraTheWizard,lol
21-04-2018T14:44:18,Vatruvius,"Clovis was the one that performed or had the means to fuse their souls. From that side comic, Clovis put in a back door and knew Natani was a she so he leveraged that info to get the two to do his bidding."
21-04-2018T14:44:56,Combak,"Terra, I can look at the source image of your avatar and see the halo around it from cropping."
21-04-2018T14:45:05,goldgardian,"ah, so he wasn't related to the Assassin guild they joined?"
21-04-2018T14:45:51,Twokinds,He's the underground moneyman
21-04-2018T14:46:20,Mippy,"Hi Tom, thanks for the confirm"
21-04-2018T14:46:30,TerraTheWizard,i fixededed it
21-04-2018T14:46:42,TerraTheWizard,added the grey to the source
21-04-2018T14:46:44,TerraTheWizard,lol
21-04-2018T14:46:46,goldgardian,"Yeah, thanks for that"
21-04-2018T14:47:08,Twokinds,A financeer with deep pockets who funds shady dealings. His guide has close ties to things like the assassin guilds.
21-04-2018T14:47:11,Vatruvius,Basically: Clovis = Bad Guy
21-04-2018T14:48:28,Mippy,Makes sence.
21-04-2018T14:48:59,qwe304,:ctwokinds-clovisgirl_shake:
21-04-2018T14:49:02,goldgardian,A second question... Why did Zen and Natani become assassins in the first place? that doesn't seem like the best way to keep your sister safe
21-04-2018T14:49:18,goldgardian,just saying...
21-04-2018T14:49:37,Vatruvius,It was the only way Zen could provide some sort of living.
21-04-2018T14:49:44,Vatruvius,Natani wanted to be with him.
21-04-2018T14:49:52,Mippy,Easy way to make money when you have nothing

21-04-2018T14:51:48,BadFoMo,"Sorry to be that fan/go off topic, but is my new request ok, Tom?"

21-04-2018T14:52:11,TerraTheWizard,lol
21-04-2018T14:52:27,Vatruvius,"There was not enough ankle showing FoMo, so no."

21-04-2018T14:54:45,BadFoMo,Cool!
21-04-2018T14:54:53,Twokinds,I trimmed the suggestion down for length. The way you described it would require too much drawing
21-04-2018T14:55:14,Twokinds,Anything involving multiple panels can't involve 4-5 people
21-04-2018T14:55:29,qwe304,"I hope kat doesn't fall for zen, she can do so much better."
21-04-2018T14:55:30,BadFoMo,"Yeah, I kinds of saw that coming."

21-04-2018T16:38:03,Vatruvius,The Zen and Ket ship is getting real.
21-04-2018T16:38:25,Vatruvius,Kat can try to howl as she is half wolf.
21-04-2018T16:38:26,ThingsAreMoving,Isn't purring and growling the same thing in essence?
21-04-2018T16:38:34,Darkewulf,no
21-04-2018T16:38:38,Bgrmystr2,no lol
21-04-2018T16:38:43,Bgrmystr2,sounds similar though
21-04-2018T16:38:44,Darkewulf,purring works a little differently

21-04-2018T16:39:14,Bgrmystr2,so she should be able to howl
21-04-2018T16:39:18,Ordithus,One of my cats I had growing up purred so loudly.  She was audible across a room
21-04-2018T16:39:19,Darkewulf,"big cats lack the vocal structures required to purr, which can be done while inhaling as well as exhaling. Cheetahs can do it, as can most smaller wild cats"

21-04-2018T17:43:52,CamtheGamerMan,Safe to say Natani and Clovis will clash in the comic at some point

21-04-2018T17:45:35,CrRAR,Clovis probably conned the bikini off Maren.
21-04-2018T17:45:35,WereKeidran,"g2g, food's about done, I'll try to vote for the last poll though, especially since it looks like my suggestion should be on that round"

21-04-2018T17:46:23,Xexanoth,the shades were too cool to live
21-04-2018T17:46:27,Ordithus,It would explain Maren's lack of... coverage in that picture with Raine
21-04-2018T17:46:27,ThingsAreMoving,"pretty much, Kiwi"
21-04-2018T17:46:29,snowsongwolf,"@vatruvius As a shy wolf, nah.  Getting away is the easy part.  Deciding WHEN to get away, that's what's usually on my mind."

21-04-2018T20:48:37,BluePhantom90,"heh I do hope we could get ""Pistol Duels"" Legal again. So those of us that know how to use a gun can shut the other side up lol"
21-04-2018T20:48:45,Bgrmystr2,why is he intimidating tho?
21-04-2018T20:48:51,qwe304,i tried reading the sign in your photo
21-04-2018T20:49:02,unsteddyphoenix,loud = scary
21-04-2018T20:49:10,unsteddyphoenix,Tale as old as time
21-04-2018T20:49:19,Ordithus,"Huh, so there's a sign in that photo"
21-04-2018T20:49:23,RH0DE,Humans are bilogically violant
21-04-2018T20:49:38,SpazztasticKiwi,More like “in your face” = give space
21-04-2018T20:49:40,RH0DE,Biologically*
21-04-2018T20:50:36,unsteddyphoenix,*violent
21-04-2018T20:51:59,BluePhantom90,could show you a old pic of myself with a Awesome RIFLE I owned T-T Sadly I had to sell for food money
21-04-2018T20:52:10,SpazztasticKiwi,"He’s not scary, I’d just not be very likely to just walk up to him"
21-04-2018T20:52:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Without a friend
21-04-2018T20:53:23,BluePhantom90,This is me when I got R&R from a year deployment. Bought a Scar-16
21-04-2018T20:53:26,BluePhantom90,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/332727437316194305/437792087841439744/100_0099.JPG
21-04-2018T20:53:41,totallynotTrace,So I was watching marks latest play of Dont play this game (I began watching it a few hours after it ended) and I ended up finding him stress full. so I turned on toms stream to de stress
21-04-2018T20:54:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"Yeah, you ever seen him mad? That’s a nope right there"
21-04-2018T20:54:58,totallynotTrace,fyi that picture isnt loadable (probably cuz i dont have discord)
21-04-2018T20:55:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I do feel for him in those videos though. I thought he was going to get sick there for a minute in the first one
21-04-2018T20:55:50,totallynotTrace,Did you see the end of marks  stream? he wasnt happy
21-04-2018T20:56:23,SpazztasticKiwi,Which stream? Don’t Play This Game stream?
21-04-2018T20:56:30,totallynotTrace,yeah
21-04-2018T20:56:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Ain’t seen but the first so far
21-04-2018T20:56:38,totallynotTrace,his latest from today
21-04-2018T20:56:44,totallynotTrace,ah
21-04-2018T20:57:16,totallynotTrace,then there was the time he threw a chair in Getting over it
21-04-2018T20:57:29,SpazztasticKiwi,That was a little much
21-04-2018T20:58:03,Bgrmystr2,I do have discord and it still doesn't work btw
21-04-2018T20:58:04,SpazztasticKiwi,Dude needs to watch his blood pressure. Got a temper
21-04-2018T20:58:07,Bgrmystr2,so
21-04-2018T20:58:54,totallynotTrace,isnt mark on like a bacon diet or something? must be great for his arteries
21-04-2018T20:59:14,MarshallMelon,Discord isn't the greatest place for image hosting anyway. Imgur's way more stable.
21-04-2018T20:59:20,Dadrobit,"Ho boy did I spoonerize that sentance. ""Dude needs to watch his blood temperature."""
21-04-2018T20:59:39,SpazztasticKiwi,All I know is he’s working out. I dunno if he’s still on keto diet or not
21-04-2018T20:59:42,Dadrobit,I was goodly confused there for a bit.
21-04-2018T20:59:58,unsteddyphoenix,If its not boiling youre not that mad
21-04-2018T21:00:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"Needs to watch his temperature too, tbh"
21-04-2018T21:00:06,totallynotTrace,blood temp is .... important
21-04-2018T21:01:03,SpazztasticKiwi,"According to twitch, he’s still live from a few hours ago"
21-04-2018T21:01:36,SpazztasticKiwi,Kirble space program it says. Unless he’s moved on
21-04-2018T21:01:54,totallynotTrace,yeah its kerbal

21-04-2018T21:02:55,totallynotTrace,Mun
21-04-2018T21:03:21,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d rather watch a try not to laugh or reading comments video than a challenge or rage game
21-04-2018T21:03:30,totallynotTrace,in kerbal space program the name of the planet Kerabals moon is Mun
21-04-2018T21:03:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Or a vid where he tells life stories
21-04-2018T21:04:05,Flareuim,"yes, I play that and have sent guns to the nun sun and that purple planet"
21-04-2018T21:04:22,qwe304,wonder if tom has named the moon(s) in twokinds
21-04-2018T21:04:23,Flareuim,It's like mars but ksp version
21-04-2018T21:04:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"Every now and then, he spills about another nightmare. 99% of them involve Tom it seems"
21-04-2018T21:05:06,Flareuim,What do u mean???
21-04-2018T21:05:20,totallynotTrace,being a ksp player I find his ksp streams stressfull just because he does everything so close to right but slightly incorectly
21-04-2018T21:05:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Mark rambles sometimes
21-04-2018T21:05:27,BluePhantom90,sorry is is the pic again https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/332727437316194305/437793155987931136/100_0099.JPG

21-04-2018T21:06:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,not a scar fan
21-04-2018T21:06:56,Dadrobit,"Not gonna lie, a good portion of the reason I stopped watching Mark is that even the crying videos got repetetive."
21-04-2018T21:07:05,BluePhantom90,Mines a Scar-16... r-r But I have a Adams Arms Ar-15. Which is a piston system
21-04-2018T21:07:28,Dadrobit,"Like, all the content was just so repetetive."
21-04-2018T21:07:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Windham ww-15 over here

21-04-2018T21:07:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Sad Mark is no bueno
21-04-2018T21:08:20,MarshallMelon,"They all are these days, Robit. Mark, SepticEye, etc. All of the YT personalities that market towards the younger spectrum follow the same formula."
21-04-2018T21:08:39,MarshallMelon,Pewds broke away from it after that whole scandal.
21-04-2018T21:08:54,unsteddyphoenix,Thats how it always was for youtubers whos target audience was kids
21-04-2018T21:09:01,Flareuim,Bc he isn't that pop anymore
21-04-2018T21:09:03,unsteddyphoenix,Remember Fred?
21-04-2018T21:09:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Their age range is more 19-30s actually
21-04-2018T21:09:06,Flareuim,He is just...weird
21-04-2018T21:09:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Fred was weird for the sake of being weird
21-04-2018T21:09:20,MarshallMelon,"On paper, Kiwi. In practice though..."
21-04-2018T21:09:28,totallynotTrace,fred introduced me to viral youtube
21-04-2018T21:09:37,Bgrmystr2,target audience does not equate to actual audience
21-04-2018T21:09:40,Twokinds,My age range is 19 - 30
21-04-2018T21:09:43,MarshallMelon,"I mean kudos to Fred, he milked that thing for all it was worth"

21-04-2018T21:09:58,unsteddyphoenix,Hmm.
21-04-2018T21:09:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"With what you draw, it should be"
21-04-2018T21:10:05,Dadrobit,":/ The only person I watch with any amount of regularity anymore is Day9, and I take plenty of breaks even with him."

21-04-2018T21:10:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Another reason I’m not likely to go up to Mark is the younger fans. Some of them are crazy
21-04-2018T21:10:41,Flareuim,I'm 15
21-04-2018T21:10:59,Flareuim,Id sa that it's bad
21-04-2018T21:10:59,MarshallMelon,I was always more of a Dunkey/Critikal guy myself

21-04-2018T21:19:30,totallynotTrace,and then marks fandom has spawned a new meme of locking things
21-04-2018T21:20:47,Dadrobit,"Nah, you're thinking Huey."
21-04-2018T21:21:14,Bgrmystr2,Discussion on Fluff's stream makes me question whether felines in twokinds flip the fuck out from cucumbers
21-04-2018T21:21:42,Ordithus,One of my cats was afraid of bananas...
21-04-2018T21:21:46,totallynotTrace,technicaly it does not have to be a cucumber

21-04-2018T21:29:50,totallynotTrace,same
21-04-2018T21:29:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw a lady twerking once in a video and she booty bumped her kid over
21-04-2018T21:30:11,DarthRexKing,Ha.
21-04-2018T21:30:40,totallynotTrace,I feel bad for the kid having to grow up with that type of parent
21-04-2018T21:31:57,Dadrobit,"No one's perfect, and shit happens. I'm not gonna assume one dancing accident means she a ""type"" of parent tbh."

21-04-2018T21:33:54,Dadrobit,"Well, not much anymore. She's learned pretty well to stay away when daddy puts on the music."
21-04-2018T21:34:22,totallynotTrace,ok yeah re reading what I wrote... yeah I shoouldnt judge people based on an accident. an embarasing accident
21-04-2018T21:34:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve been walking around and stepped on my cat’s before
21-04-2018T21:34:54,totallynotTrace,eesh

21-04-2018T21:44:02,Dadrobit,Nice of you to assume that?
21-04-2018T21:44:04,Bgrmystr2,"but agree, phoenix, that's still fucked up"
21-04-2018T21:44:13,qwe304,discord said he was playing a game
21-04-2018T21:44:35,Bgrmystr2,could have somethin else open in the background too
21-04-2018T21:44:35,Ordithus,Now he might know not to just open random batch files...
21-04-2018T21:44:49,Dadrobit,I take gaming breaks too. Doesn't mean I don't have important shit going on in the background.
21-04-2018T21:44:50,Vatruvius,Nothing gets emotions running high then reading the chapter 12 ending...
21-04-2018T21:45:06,qwe304,he uses google docs
21-04-2018T21:45:19,qwe304,he wouldntve lost anything
21-04-2018T21:45:37,totallynotTrace,my computer crashed the other day. like completely. not even a bluescreen. whent all the way back to the bios. I had just opened my 7 page (so far) research paper. fortunately hadnt made changes
21-04-2018T21:45:38,unsteddyphoenix,And if he was using some other software?
21-04-2018T21:46:07,qwe304,then he wouldve been laughing when he came back online
21-04-2018T21:46:07,unsteddyphoenix,I bet you like those youtube prank channels
21-04-2018T21:46:47,Dadrobit,"""I prank kidnap my best friends 2 year old daughter"""
21-04-2018T21:46:57,Ordithus,"Chill, guys.  Seriously, that's not even close, robit."
21-04-2018T21:47:05,totallynotTrace,my teacher requires very specific things and google docs doesnt quite fit the bill for him
21-04-2018T21:47:06,qwe304,"chill, we do this type of stuff to each other, he pulled up e621 on my laptop in class when I walked out"
21-04-2018T21:47:46,Dadrobit,"You're right, Ord. I forgot an apostrophe. ""I prank kidnap my best friend's 2 year old daughter"""
21-04-2018T21:47:46,Vatruvius,I learned from a long time ago to not click on links or executables without checking them thoroughly.
21-04-2018T21:47:56,Ordithus,"""I always throw close friendships out for minor slights"""
21-04-2018T21:47:58,unsteddyphoenix,"I saw this one where like, they tricked kids into thinking their house was on fire"
21-04-2018T21:48:04,totallynotTrace,do I want to know what e621 is? I have a feeling no
21-04-2018T21:48:29,qwe304,its a certian variety of furry materiel
21-04-2018T21:48:35,qwe304,thats all you need to know
21-04-2018T21:48:37,Dadrobit,It's a sodium molecule iirc Trace
21-04-2018T21:48:53,unsteddyphoenix,"But yeah, dont need friends like that Ord."
21-04-2018T21:49:04,totallynotTrace,i only do minor pranks that can deffinately wont cause any form of dammage
21-04-2018T21:49:39,qwe304,my friends arent the type that would get mad at that even if he HAD been doing somthing important
21-04-2018T21:49:40,Vatruvius,The worst my pranks get are the absolutely perfect pun...that's it.
21-04-2018T21:50:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I once saw a prank like video where a guy was walking around telling girls he was going around making people’s days better
21-04-2018T21:50:22,SpazztasticKiwi,All he was doing was taking his shirt off in front of them
21-04-2018T21:51:06,unsteddyphoenix,lol
21-04-2018T21:51:09,Vatruvius,I knew a guy who's friends pranked him by buying him HuniePop. Forever in his library.
21-04-2018T21:51:32,qwe304,"when he came back ""im running on steam link you cheeky **** i had to log back into my computer from the other side of the house lol"""
21-04-2018T21:52:08,Dadrobit,"Yup, sodium molecule. ""monosodium glutamate"" ohterwise known as ""MSG""."
21-04-2018T21:52:37,Vatruvius,:thinking:
21-04-2018T21:53:56,Bgrmystr2,"lol vatru, I'd accept that"
21-04-2018T21:53:56,Ordithus,"If you want to get real creative, you could probably change his wallpaper to this or something https://www.patreon.com/posts/keidran-singles-11311293"
21-04-2018T21:54:03,totallynotTrace,one time I accidentally left my laptop at a friends house (I told him my password) and when he gave it back to me at school a few days later i found he set it so a link to a youtube video of never going to give you up plays whenI log on
21-04-2018T21:54:25,Dadrobit,Chemical Formula: C5H8NO4Na
21-04-2018T21:54:57,Twokinds,My mother once put MSG in a salt container without labelling it.
21-04-2018T21:55:10,Twokinds,I poured it on some popcorn. It did not taste good.
21-04-2018T21:55:11,BluePhantom90,lol
21-04-2018T21:55:13,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-zenshocked:
21-04-2018T21:55:13,Bgrmystr2,"also, you can contact steam support and tell them if you do't want a game key in your library"
21-04-2018T21:55:14,Vatruvius,Whoops.
21-04-2018T21:55:16,Bgrmystr2,and they will delete it
21-04-2018T21:55:19,Bgrmystr2,so..
21-04-2018T21:55:20,Bgrmystr2,yeh
21-04-2018T21:55:28,Bgrmystr2,and that's no good tom
21-04-2018T21:55:30,BadFoMo,MSG?
21-04-2018T21:56:22,Vatruvius,"Either he plays it...or his friends do when they are over like he told me. I am inclined to believe the latter as I gamed with him quite a bit, never once was he online playing that game."
21-04-2018T21:56:57,Vatruvius,He barley had the time to play with me as it was.
21-04-2018T21:57:06,Dadrobit,"It's a very popular seasoning put into food that in of itself does not taste like much, FoMo."
21-04-2018T21:57:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Did she realize what she was doing Tom
21-04-2018T21:57:21,unsteddyphoenix,I heard it just makes everything taste good
21-04-2018T21:57:25,unsteddyphoenix,Never actually used it
21-04-2018T21:57:28,BadFoMo,Ok?
21-04-2018T21:57:43,Dadrobit,It's in almost everything.
21-04-2018T21:57:54,Twokinds,"Well, it does not go well on popcorn."
21-04-2018T21:58:02,Vatruvius,lol
21-04-2018T21:58:03,unsteddyphoenix,Now we know
21-04-2018T21:58:06,Dadrobit,shudders
21-04-2018T21:58:35,Dadrobit,FoMo. I bring it up because earlier it was asked what E621 was. It's another name for MSG.
21-04-2018T21:58:39,SpazztasticKiwi,Oopsies
21-04-2018T21:58:41,Vatruvius,"Butter-less popcorn is not that bad actually, had some a few weeks ago."
21-04-2018T21:58:51,unsteddyphoenix,wait really?
21-04-2018T21:58:54,unsteddyphoenix,"Is that like, the joke?"
21-04-2018T21:58:55,Dadrobit,Yes
21-04-2018T21:59:08,Dadrobit,It's also the jok.
21-04-2018T21:59:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Plain popcorn is pretty ok
21-04-2018T21:59:11,Dadrobit,joke*
21-04-2018T21:59:19,unsteddyphoenix,huh.
21-04-2018T21:59:21,unsteddyphoenix,nnneat
21-04-2018T21:59:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I like the caramel popcorn though
21-04-2018T21:59:52,Dadrobit,It has little flavour itself but enhances the flavour of proteins either by increasing the amount of saliva produced in the mouth or by stimulating the taste buds.
21-04-2018T22:00:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Get that science talk outta here
21-04-2018T22:00:25,totallynotTrace,no
21-04-2018T22:00:33,totallynotTrace,BRING ALL THE SCIENCE
21-04-2018T22:00:53,Dadrobit,"Which means that it goes best with protein heavy foods, so popcorn has less of a positive connection."
21-04-2018T22:01:10,Ordithus,"Steak, however"
21-04-2018T22:01:23,totallynotTrace,MMMMMmmmm steak
21-04-2018T22:01:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Well done 🥩
21-04-2018T22:01:35,SpazztasticKiwi,With some butter
21-04-2018T22:01:51,totallynotTrace,no. nononononononononononononononnoonononononononononononononoononon not well done
21-04-2018T22:01:54,Ordithus,"Only wave the steak in the direction of the grill, acknowledging its power.  Then eat."
21-04-2018T22:01:58,Vatruvius,"And that is why your fast food meals taste good, take out the sugar, salt, and msg and you would not be able to swallow."
21-04-2018T22:02:03,SpazztasticKiwi,And maybe sour cream and sautéed mushrooms
21-04-2018T22:02:54,totallynotTrace,personaly prefer carmelized onions over 'shrooms
21-04-2018T22:03:10,Bgrmystr2,I love how people have such a difference of opinion about steak.. and here I am just.. I don't like the taste of it irrelevant how it is
21-04-2018T22:03:18,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
21-04-2018T22:03:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m more of a fish person than a steak person
21-04-2018T22:03:46,Vatruvius,Definitely a red meat guy.
21-04-2018T22:04:01,totallynotTrace,im definately not any type of seafood person
21-04-2018T22:04:15,Ordithus,I like food :D
21-04-2018T22:04:17,Vatruvius,I mean...I will eat shrimp.
21-04-2018T22:04:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"Shrimp and lobster, but not a big fan of crab"
21-04-2018T22:05:00,Vatruvius,"Lobster is touch and go with me, I have yet to eat a really good lobster."
21-04-2018T22:05:09,totallynotTrace,@ordithus yeah. I think thats just the safest answer right now
21-04-2018T22:05:34,SpazztasticKiwi,🦐 🦀 🐟
21-04-2018T22:06:00,Bgrmystr2,"pass on all of it, me."
21-04-2018T22:07:32,Vatruvius,"No matter...if any of you have eaten organic, pasture bacon you would know you can never go back to regular bacon."
21-04-2018T22:08:16,unsteddyphoenix,Us: any food Bgr: pass on that one
21-04-2018T22:08:39,Bgrmystr2,lol naw
21-04-2018T22:08:42,Bgrmystr2,I do have foods I do eat
21-04-2018T22:08:55,Ordithus,Like... burgers?
21-04-2018T22:08:56,totallynotTrace,did someone say bacon? :smiley:
21-04-2018T22:08:58,Vatruvius,Us: food Bgr: mineral water
21-04-2018T22:09:10,Bgrmystr2,"mineral water is nasty as fuck,"
21-04-2018T22:09:14,Bgrmystr2,"also, no"
21-04-2018T22:09:16,Bgrmystr2,no burgers
21-04-2018T22:09:24,Bgrmystr2,I do like bacon tho :D
21-04-2018T22:09:32,Bgrmystr2,like the other 95% of the world
21-04-2018T22:09:42,Bgrmystr2,or whatever percent it was
21-04-2018T22:09:50,Bgrmystr2,I don't recall what it was estimated at xD
21-04-2018T22:10:14,unsteddyphoenix,Probably not right
21-04-2018T22:10:20,totallynotTrace,bgr: when i read your name it goes through my had as burger myster 2
21-04-2018T22:10:21,unsteddyphoenix,Considering how many jews + arabs there are
21-04-2018T22:10:39,Ordithus,"and hindus, and vegetarians and vegans"
21-04-2018T22:10:57,Vatruvius,95% seems too high
21-04-2018T22:11:04,Bgrmystr2,"the estimation was based on taste buds and stuff, not preferences"
21-04-2018T22:11:11,Vatruvius,If that was the case we would have world pace at the Bacon Summit.
21-04-2018T22:11:24,Vatruvius,peace*
21-04-2018T22:11:33,Bgrmystr2,"yeah I'm just exaggerating, it was probably like 70% or something like that"
21-04-2018T22:11:52,totallynotTrace,they now have lab grown kelp that tastes and has the texture of bacon
21-04-2018T22:12:02,Bgrmystr2,cuz bacon has a bunch of properties that your taste buds find good rather than bad
21-04-2018T22:12:15,Bgrmystr2,I don't recall all the details though
21-04-2018T22:12:39,Ordithus,"salt and fat, yum"
21-04-2018T22:13:13,Vatruvius,"The human body in naturally attracted to 3 things above all else: sugar, salt, and fat."
21-04-2018T22:13:37,Vatruvius,"Bacon has salt, fat, and in some cases sugar depending on the type/brand you buy."
21-04-2018T22:13:51,unsteddyphoenix,i like those things
21-04-2018T22:13:53,totallynotTrace,maple flavored bacon
21-04-2018T22:14:28,Dadrobit,I too dip my bacon in maple.
21-04-2018T22:14:28,Bgrmystr2,http://thewateringmouth.com/what-is-umami-why-does-bacon-taste-so-good/ This page has a pretty good read about it
21-04-2018T22:14:42,Vatruvius,"Mew...I like good old plain bacon. Since I mention I eat organic, pasture raised bacon there is no comparison. Sugar of any kind ruins it."
21-04-2018T22:14:48,Bgrmystr2,even includes MSG xD
21-04-2018T22:15:39,Vatruvius,They really put their budget into diagrams...
21-04-2018T22:15:42,Dadrobit,You're like the anti-vegan.
21-04-2018T22:16:18,Ordithus,"Vatru, you sound like an advertisement XD"
21-04-2018T22:16:44,Vatruvius,I sound like an ad...:thinking:
21-04-2018T22:16:59,Vatruvius,How?
21-04-2018T22:17:02,Dadrobit,Telling everyone that they don't eat meat and everyone else is missing out vs telling everyone exactly what kind of meat they eat and how everyone else is mising out.
21-04-2018T22:17:59,unsteddyphoenix,Lol the hipster meat-eater
21-04-2018T22:18:09,unsteddyphoenix,Thats probably going to be a thing
21-04-2018T22:18:34,Ordithus,"""I eat organic, pasture raised bacon"" Then you list off scientific reasons why bacon is delicious"
21-04-2018T22:18:41,Dadrobit,"Exactly, I wasn't sure what to call it though. Urban Dictionary failed me this time."
21-04-2018T22:18:52,Bgrmystr2,@totallynotTrace btw it's Berger Meister
21-04-2018T22:19:01,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-flat::ctwokinds-renirawr:
21-04-2018T22:19:04,Bgrmystr2,so now you know :u
21-04-2018T22:19:15,Vatruvius,You are putting two things together that were seperated.
21-04-2018T22:19:25,Vatruvius,separated*
21-04-2018T22:19:50,Ordithus,"Well, I'm taking it and selling it then :ctwokinds-adiracoin:"
21-04-2018T22:20:24,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: what exactly are you selling
21-04-2018T22:20:27,Vatruvius,I told you what type of bacon I eat. It was later brought up why bacon is so delicious and I commented on why. It is not bacon exclusive. That applies to all food.
21-04-2018T22:20:37,Dadrobit,"You actually sandwiched it. You mentioned the organic pasture rasied buzzwords once, then did the ""natural attraction"" bit, then back to the buzzwords."
21-04-2018T22:21:00,Ordithus,"Vatru, you are missing out on a career as a bacon salesman"
21-04-2018T22:21:06,Vatruvius,I don't know how else to describe what bacon I eat.
21-04-2018T22:21:14,Dadrobit,Pig strips
21-04-2018T22:21:27,Ordithus,pig noodle
21-04-2018T22:21:41,Vatruvius,"But the organic, pasture raised is the crucial part here."
21-04-2018T22:21:42,unsteddyphoenix,*Free range pig strips
21-04-2018T22:21:46,Bgrmystr2,"I'm not sure if you're being an advertisement for bacon, vatru, but if you're not trying to be, you can take it as a compliment? :o"
21-04-2018T22:21:48,totallynotTrace,yeah great idea. ill now go around casually calling bacon pig noodles
21-04-2018T22:22:00,Bgrmystr2,but they're not noodles
21-04-2018T22:22:06,Bgrmystr2,bacon is crunchy and stuff
21-04-2018T22:22:10,Bgrmystr2,and not.. noodle-like
21-04-2018T22:22:18,unsteddyphoenix,I only eat pigs that have a diet of olive gardan salads
21-04-2018T22:22:29,Dadrobit,"Sorry, my bad. ""Slightly more expensive pig strips"""
21-04-2018T22:22:39,Vatruvius,"I do not see how that would be profitable, to tasty unsteddy."
21-04-2018T22:22:51,Vatruvius,or*
21-04-2018T22:22:56,Bgrmystr2,the pigs would probably die
21-04-2018T22:23:00,Bgrmystr2,:/
21-04-2018T22:23:04,Dadrobit,But Olive Garden salads are loaded with MSG
21-04-2018T22:23:13,unsteddyphoenix,"...uh, bgr? Not sure how to tell you this..."
21-04-2018T22:23:37,unsteddyphoenix,YOu have to kill pigs to eat them :/
21-04-2018T22:23:42,unsteddyphoenix,Im sorry you had to find out this way
21-04-2018T22:23:44,Bgrmystr2,"Oh, that's irrelevant"
21-04-2018T22:23:54,Bgrmystr2,I was expecting you to tell me there are pigs that ONLY eat salad
21-04-2018T22:23:56,Bgrmystr2,and I'm like
21-04-2018T22:24:01,Bgrmystr2,fucking really? xD Is that a thing?
21-04-2018T22:24:11,Dadrobit,MSG occurs naturally in Parmesan Cheese. Why do you think they use it in everything?
21-04-2018T22:24:12,unsteddyphoenix,"I bet there are pet pigs that have like, expensive diets"
21-04-2018T22:24:27,unsteddyphoenix,Parmesan is :ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl::ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl::ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl::ctwokinds-evalswink_sparkl:

21-04-2018T22:25:42,Vatruvius,"The majority of pics are fed corn, just like cattle, only in some cases do they eat a regular diet like the pigs I get my bacon from, they eat grasses and stuff like a normal pig would."
21-04-2018T22:25:51,Vatruvius,pigs*
21-04-2018T22:25:58,totallynotTrace,but stuff like the craft stuff is barely cheese

21-04-2018T22:26:36,Bgrmystr2,Were there pig keidran before they all got turned into bacon?
21-04-2018T22:26:40,Dadrobit,Pig keidran are the tastiest keidran.
21-04-2018T22:27:28,Dadrobit,Followed by the mer keidran sushi rolls.
21-04-2018T22:27:47,totallynotTrace,this got dark

21-04-2018T22:35:25,SpazztasticKiwi,“I see what you did there...and over there too”

21-04-2018T22:35:36,Bgrmystr2,unfortunately.

21-04-2018T22:35:46,Bgrmystr2,probably the last bacon-caused durr though
21-04-2018T22:37:57,unsteddyphoenix,It was the best of derps it was the worst of derps

21-04-2018T22:45:29,Dadrobit,"Black Pepper, Salt, Red Pepper, Cilantro, Parsley, Chicken Wontons."
21-04-2018T22:45:33,Dadrobit,Pretty good.
21-04-2018T22:48:06,unsteddyphoenix,thats different from ramen I think
21-04-2018T22:48:27,SpazztasticKiwi,I got ramen 🍜
21-04-2018T22:48:31,Dadrobit,That's how I cooked my ramen
21-04-2018T22:48:54,unsteddyphoenix,teach me sometime
21-04-2018T22:49:00,Dadrobit,The ingredients other than noodles.
21-04-2018T22:50:24,SpazztasticKiwi,I cook food. Sit down with food. Forgot drink
21-04-2018T22:50:30,Dadrobit,Add the aforementioned ingredients to water just deep enough to barely not cover a ramen brick. Bring to a boil and never stop stirring until the water is completely boiled away. Pour noodles and wontons into a bowl and enjoy
21-04-2018T22:51:04,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-RainezZz: Night fellas
21-04-2018T22:51:09,Dadrobit,o/ Ord
21-04-2018T22:51:53,unsteddyphoenix,night
21-04-2018T22:52:42,Twokinds,NIGHT!!!
21-04-2018T22:53:15,unsteddyphoenix,aggressive well-wishing
21-04-2018T22:53:28,Dadrobit,Just water for me tonight. Had a couple old fashioned cocktails last night at the con.
21-04-2018T22:54:10,Dadrobit,Probably part of the reason for this morning's headache.
21-04-2018T22:54:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Alcohol. Pass
21-04-2018T22:54:29,Dadrobit,Tasty alcohol.
21-04-2018T22:54:39,Dadrobit,Pass me another
21-04-2018T22:54:58,Dadrobit,"(Not really, I barely drink)"
21-04-2018T22:55:10,unsteddyphoenix,Same
21-04-2018T22:55:13,unsteddyphoenix,Too expensive~
21-04-2018T22:55:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Though there’s this shop somewhere that supposedly sells mango juice that’s 8% alcohol
21-04-2018T22:55:27,unsteddyphoenix,that sounds great
21-04-2018T22:55:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I wanna try it but at the same time I do not
21-04-2018T22:55:44,Twokinds,I'm amazed at how much money some people spend on beer and cigarettes.
21-04-2018T22:55:45,Dadrobit,Hard mango cider sounds pretty good.
21-04-2018T22:55:48,unsteddyphoenix,One of my favourite drinks is this japanese melon liquor
21-04-2018T22:55:49,Twokinds,Dunno how people afford it.
21-04-2018T22:56:11,unsteddyphoenix,I know~
21-04-2018T22:56:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Many can’t and the alcohol covers that fact
21-04-2018T22:56:19,Dadrobit,"Lol, a single bottle costs around $45, but it lasts me a good year honestly."
21-04-2018T22:56:24,unsteddyphoenix,Even buying some for the occasional party is expensive to me
21-04-2018T22:56:38,Dadrobit,750 ml.
21-04-2018T22:56:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Some of the 12 packs we sell is like $20
21-04-2018T22:56:58,unsteddyphoenix,"Lol yeah I had like, half a small bottle of vodka for half a year"
21-04-2018T22:57:00,unsteddyphoenix,Untouched
21-04-2018T22:57:12,Dadrobit,I... I might have some vodka still.
21-04-2018T22:57:15,unsteddyphoenix,Until I poured a bunch of red skittles in it to turn it red
21-04-2018T22:57:15,Dadrobit,hold up.
21-04-2018T22:57:24,unsteddyphoenix,"Which works, fun fact."
21-04-2018T22:57:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Vodka’s been described as a touch of death as I’ve seen
21-04-2018T22:58:03,unsteddyphoenix,Naw it's  not bad. You can mix it with a bunch of stuff.
21-04-2018T22:58:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a feeling I’d be more of a wine person
21-04-2018T22:58:12,unsteddyphoenix,I cant handle like bourbon or whisky
21-04-2018T22:58:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Right now I prefer sparkling grape juice though
21-04-2018T22:58:33,SpazztasticKiwi,No hangover
21-04-2018T22:58:35,Dadrobit,"I do, Vanilla Smirnoff. Half a bottle from who knows when."
21-04-2018T22:59:03,Dadrobit,And Malibu Coconut Rum. I legitimately do not know where that came from...
21-04-2018T22:59:12,unsteddyphoenix,oo that sounds good
21-04-2018T22:59:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"There’s some traditions though with alcohol, like buy a wine the same age you were born and have it at your wedding or buy a bottle the year of your wedding and drink it on your anniversary or something"
21-04-2018T22:59:51,Dadrobit,"Unsteddy, do you drink whiskey on the rocks or neat?"
21-04-2018T23:00:28,unsteddyphoenix,"I...dont drink whisky. But I had it neat when I did drink it, I guess."
21-04-2018T23:00:55,Dadrobit,Try on the rocks. And or in a cocktail like a Manhattan or Old Fashioned.
21-04-2018T23:01:27,Dadrobit,"Neat is rough sometimes even for me, and bourbon is 98% of what I drink for alcohol."
21-04-2018T23:02:03,unsteddyphoenix,Well arent you a real man
21-04-2018T23:02:08,unsteddyphoenix,:O
21-04-2018T23:02:09,Dadrobit,Danmed skippy.
21-04-2018T23:02:24,unsteddyphoenix,Guess I could try. Though im pretty put off even by the smell now
21-04-2018T23:02:27,unsteddyphoenix,Bad experiences~
21-04-2018T23:02:47,Dadrobit,"Also, it's just not for everyone, some folks just never get it."
21-04-2018T23:03:11,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, you could say that about alcohol in general"
21-04-2018T23:03:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Some people can’t have it
21-04-2018T23:03:30,Dadrobit,"Yeah, that's the larger sentiment."
21-04-2018T23:03:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Religious or dietary reasons
21-04-2018T23:04:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"Technically as Baptist, I shouldn’t drink"
21-04-2018T23:04:22,Dadrobit,Took me until I was 23 and got gateway'd in by a Maple flavored Jim Beam
21-04-2018T23:04:37,Dadrobit,That shit was/is goddamned delicious.
21-04-2018T23:04:56,unsteddyphoenix,But the blood of christ!
21-04-2018T23:05:01,unsteddyphoenix,Ho~ that does sound good
21-04-2018T23:05:02,unsteddyphoenix,"""Maple"
21-04-2018T23:05:08,unsteddyphoenix,isnt a flavour you really see here much
21-04-2018T23:05:40,SpazztasticKiwi,Wine drinking is primarily Catholic
21-04-2018T23:05:54,Dadrobit,35% alc. content. You can barely taste a hint of alcohol behind the flavor.
21-04-2018T23:05:58,SpazztasticKiwi,We use grape juice
21-04-2018T23:06:06,Dadrobit,It's very dangerous.
21-04-2018T23:07:00,unsteddyphoenix,...at church?
21-04-2018T23:07:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I find drinking dangerous in a nutshell
21-04-2018T23:07:03,Dadrobit,Not sure if it actually counts as a bourbon actually.
21-04-2018T23:07:11,Dadrobit,But it says it is.
21-04-2018T23:07:31,unsteddyphoenix,Who's going to criticise it when theyre all drunk
21-04-2018T23:07:33,unsteddyphoenix,genius
21-04-2018T23:07:33,Dadrobit,actually redundant
21-04-2018T23:07:49,Dadrobit,200 IQ
21-04-2018T23:08:22,SpazztasticKiwi,They were selling alcoholic drinks at Jack’s show. I got a fruit juice thing
21-04-2018T23:09:29,SpazztasticKiwi,And that thing didn’t leave my hand
21-04-2018T23:10:42,Dadrobit,"Alcoholic juice? Or like, a Mott's Fruit Juice box?"
21-04-2018T23:10:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Punch. No alcohol
21-04-2018T23:11:02,Dadrobit,Ahhh
21-04-2018T23:11:26,SpazztasticKiwi,"You could ask for them to add liquor, but I wasn’t around home"
21-04-2018T23:11:36,Dadrobit,(I still drink those juice boxes at my grandma's when she has them)
21-04-2018T23:11:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Everybody still likes the little juice boxes
21-04-2018T23:12:33,unsteddyphoenix,Your grandma has those cute little juice boxes
21-04-2018T23:12:36,unsteddyphoenix,And also weed parties
21-04-2018T23:12:39,unsteddyphoenix,Sure
21-04-2018T23:13:03,Dadrobit,She's got a million great grandkids. Of course she still has those little boxes lol.
21-04-2018T23:13:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Grandmas: feeders of hoards
21-04-2018T23:14:00,Dadrobit,I just steal them from my nieces and nephews.
21-04-2018T23:14:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Though there’s some mothers that are like that too
21-04-2018T23:14:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Someone comes to visit and it’s break out the snacks and cook a full course meal
21-04-2018T23:14:47,unsteddyphoenix,Nice
21-04-2018T23:14:51,unsteddyphoenix,Do you push them over too?
21-04-2018T23:15:06,Dadrobit,You know that Sparta Kick from 300?
21-04-2018T23:15:30,Dadrobit,This! Is! Grandma's!
21-04-2018T23:15:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Have y’all seen Thomas Sanders’s “last cookie” vine

21-04-2018T23:17:48,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s about a minute in
21-04-2018T23:18:37,Dadrobit,"Ahhhh, the ""daddy's gettin' that cookie""."

21-04-2018T23:20:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don’t know where he gets his comedy gift, but it’s great"
21-04-2018T23:21:12,TheBeckoner,"""stupid jimmy"" lmao I lost it"
21-04-2018T23:22:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Need to see that guy at a con
21-04-2018T23:23:39,SpazztasticKiwi,And this Thomas too of course
21-04-2018T23:24:24,Bgrmystr2,Ahh that
21-04-2018T23:24:39,Twokinds,:D
21-04-2018T23:26:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Did...did you just call Tom a “that”
21-04-2018T23:26:34,SpazztasticKiwi,😁
21-04-2018T23:27:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I’ll admit it’ll probably be a toss up if I recognize you at a con or not
21-04-2018T23:27:37,unsteddyphoenix,"Theres like, 3 pictures of him..."
21-04-2018T23:27:42,unsteddyphoenix,How long is your hair Tom
21-04-2018T23:28:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve seen quite a few
21-04-2018T23:28:05,Twokinds,Shoulder-length
21-04-2018T23:28:09,Twokinds,Or thereabouts
21-04-2018T23:28:13,TheBeckoner,There's some video too  I think
21-04-2018T23:28:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Mine’s only slightly longer
21-04-2018T23:28:30,SpazztasticKiwi,Shoulder blades
21-04-2018T23:28:37,TheBeckoner,Mine would be below my ears if it wasnt curly
21-04-2018T23:28:49,TheBeckoner,well
21-04-2018T23:28:50,TheBeckoner,like
21-04-2018T23:29:01,TheBeckoner,way below them lol it already is below them a bit
21-04-2018T23:29:07,SpazztasticKiwi,"If I took the time to straighten it, mine would be maybe another inch or so longer"
21-04-2018T23:29:17,unsteddyphoenix,"mm, same."
21-04-2018T23:29:28,unsteddyphoenix,gotta cut
21-04-2018T23:30:11,Dadrobit,":( internet died. Why Cox, why would you do this?"
21-04-2018T23:30:19,TheBeckoner,My tolerance ends once it gets in my eyes
21-04-2018T23:30:50,SpazztasticKiwi,there is a picture I’ve found is pretty good. If no one opposes to a Pinterest link
21-04-2018T23:31:09,unsteddyphoenix,I hate pintrest but I will tolerate it
21-04-2018T23:31:12,SpazztasticKiwi,https://pin.it/hqg4ko6yyu6vrn
21-04-2018T23:31:59,Dadrobit,Poor choice of shirts. The red shirts always die first.
21-04-2018T23:32:11,unsteddyphoenix,Man. Tom really does have nice hair.
21-04-2018T23:32:15,unsteddyphoenix,bit jealous
21-04-2018T23:32:28,unsteddyphoenix,I have one red shirt and it's holding up ok I think?
21-04-2018T23:32:39,unsteddyphoenix,Only faded shirts I seem to have a black really
21-04-2018T23:34:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Almost had a stroke. My name was on my profile
21-04-2018T23:35:14,SpazztasticKiwi,And that picture linked to my profile
21-04-2018T23:36:12,unsteddyphoenix,Dun dunn~
21-04-2018T23:36:16,unsteddyphoenix,What does your icon say?
21-04-2018T23:37:16,Dadrobit,Is there a name for the phenomena where a beard doesn't grow completely around the edge of the lips?
21-04-2018T23:37:25,Dadrobit,Specifically the lower lip
21-04-2018T23:37:29,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m a fangirl. We don’t do calm
21-04-2018T23:37:43,Dadrobit,Where it just grows up the center and is clean on either side.
21-04-2018T23:37:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I have calmed down quite a bit I feel
21-04-2018T23:38:34,unsteddyphoenix,Like when your moustache doesnt connect to your beard?
21-04-2018T23:38:40,unsteddyphoenix,I HATE that
21-04-2018T23:38:51,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t have this problem :ptv-condescending:
21-04-2018T23:39:08,unsteddyphoenix,count your blessings
21-04-2018T23:39:12,unsteddyphoenix,Its very upsetting
21-04-2018T23:39:28,Dadrobit,I have that on my left lip. There's a tiny bald spot where I don't grow.
21-04-2018T23:39:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Instead I have to shave my arms legs and maintain my eyebrows
21-04-2018T23:39:45,unsteddyphoenix,shave your arms?
21-04-2018T23:39:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Under arms obviously
21-04-2018T23:39:55,Dadrobit,So the mustache has to grow longer just above for me to do a comb over.
21-04-2018T23:40:17,Dadrobit,Found it! Soul Patch!
21-04-2018T23:40:27,unsteddyphoenix,ah
21-04-2018T23:40:31,Dadrobit,How could I forget about that
21-04-2018T23:40:38,unsteddyphoenix,Doubt you have to shave those daily though
21-04-2018T23:40:49,SpazztasticKiwi,Because it siphons parts of your soul away when you see it in a mirror?
21-04-2018T23:40:59,unsteddyphoenix,Thats what it feels like
21-04-2018T23:41:17,Dadrobit,"Nah, because it was popular with Jazz players in the 50's."
21-04-2018T23:41:25,Dadrobit,"""Soul"" patch."
21-04-2018T23:42:14,unsteddyphoenix,sounds cool then
21-04-2018T23:42:44,Dadrobit,"Anyways, I bring it up in sympathy, as it is something I suffer from simply because the rest of it under the lips just doesn't grow in for me."
21-04-2018T23:43:00,Dadrobit,Akin to what Mark has going on.
21-04-2018T23:45:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I think the hair growing gene went to Tom
21-04-2018T23:46:14,SpazztasticKiwi,"And no we don’t shave everyday, but it’s often every week if we want to keep the look up"
21-04-2018T23:47:51,Bgrmystr2,I'd trade w/ you dadro
21-04-2018T23:47:57,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s why I find it funny the TK ladies don’t know the pain
21-04-2018T23:47:58,Bgrmystr2,I get full facial hair and for the most part do not want it
21-04-2018T23:48:25,TheBeckoner,"Same, I just shave."
21-04-2018T23:48:27,Bgrmystr2,so I wouldn't mind if it didn't grow. would save me time.

21-04-2018T23:49:28,Dadrobit,"Nine o clock shadow with goatee was my look, until 9 o clock turned to midnight and I got too lazy to shave."
