06-07-2018T00:19:03,MarvTheHugPharaoh,no
06-07-2018T14:02:03,Dadrobit,I wonder how many more times people are going to ask about shipping details that literally no one can possibly know?
06-07-2018T16:04:46,Xexanoth,until it's shipped
06-07-2018T16:44:37,Dadrobit,"Folks are gonna have their books in hand and be like, ""But when's shipping?"""

06-07-2018T23:45:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Screaming trees - also known as cicadas
06-07-2018T23:46:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"But I swear it’s the trees trying to make us think it’s the bugs cause I’ve seen a cicada and I’ve heard one, but I’ve never watched one actually make the noise"
06-07-2018T23:46:49,CrRAR,sneaky buggers
06-07-2018T23:47:27,CrRAR,soooo much worse than plain 'ol cheeky bugges~
06-07-2018T23:49:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"They’re completely harmless, but huge bugs. I’ve seen one up close and they look like they could play heavy metal"
