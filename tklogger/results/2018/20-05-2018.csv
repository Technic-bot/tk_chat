20-05-2018T00:01:29,Bgrmystr2,a triangular prism apparently
20-05-2018T00:01:31,Bgrmystr2,is what it's called
20-05-2018T00:01:44,Bgrmystr2,"a full 3d triangle, like, not a pyramid"
20-05-2018T00:01:53,Bgrmystr2,so you'd need that for a pillow
20-05-2018T00:02:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Are you saying girls are complicated unsteddy? :ptv-condescending:
20-05-2018T00:02:03,Bgrmystr2,which would stil be pretty damn cool
20-05-2018T00:02:14,Bgrmystr2,"naw, kiwi, girls just have cooties"
20-05-2018T00:02:26,Bgrmystr2,and pillows don't

20-05-2018T00:12:27,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s a pre-work out snack
20-05-2018T00:12:30,unsteddyphoenix,Why a protein shake? Are you working out?
20-05-2018T00:12:33,unsteddyphoenix,Say it isnt so

20-05-2018T00:13:08,unsteddyphoenix,That cant be healthy
20-05-2018T00:13:24,Twokinds,I'm not even pale anymore.
20-05-2018T00:13:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Are you happy with your progress?
20-05-2018T00:13:35,Bgrmystr2,now he's just white :v

20-05-2018T00:13:43,unsteddyphoenix,Thats the WORST colour
20-05-2018T00:13:46,Bgrmystr2,first yellow.. then pale..
20-05-2018T00:13:55,Bgrmystr2,and now he lacks ALL color in his skin entirely
20-05-2018T00:13:59,Bgrmystr2,he's blank!
20-05-2018T00:14:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"Instead of looking like bleach, he looks like aged parchment"
20-05-2018T00:14:10,Bgrmystr2,the next level he'll be seethrough! :ptv-shock:
20-05-2018T00:14:18,unsteddyphoenix,I feel betrayed
20-05-2018T00:14:28,Twokinds,"Yeah, I've lost 8 lbs."
20-05-2018T00:14:29,SpazztasticKiwi,With that dark hair you must look like a nightmare
20-05-2018T00:14:45,SpazztasticKiwi,That came out sounding meaner than I thought
20-05-2018T00:14:47,unsteddyphoenix,Congrats!
20-05-2018T00:14:53,unsteddyphoenix,"Thats a good amount, right?"

20-05-2018T00:18:41,Twokinds,We'll be walking a lot
20-05-2018T00:19:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Werk it
20-05-2018T00:19:21,Twokinds,"But yeah, I'm not going to worry too much about sticking to a diet while I'm there."
20-05-2018T00:19:31,Twokinds,Gotta enjoy life sometimes.
20-05-2018T00:19:54,SpazztasticKiwi,:ctwokinds-zenshocked: Enjoy life?
20-05-2018T00:19:55,unsteddyphoenix,I thought the point of the diet was to eat what you wanted at the con
20-05-2018T00:20:19,unsteddyphoenix,Oh is thaaat what you do with it
20-05-2018T00:20:43,Twokinds,We're gunna go to Der Biergarten
20-05-2018T00:20:55,SpazztasticKiwi,The wat
20-05-2018T00:21:05,Twokinds,Der Biergarten
20-05-2018T00:21:29,Twokinds,The Beer Garden

20-05-2018T00:21:45,unsteddyphoenix,Are you...gonna...drink beer? :thinking:
20-05-2018T00:21:47,Twokinds,It's all german food
20-05-2018T00:21:58,Twokinds,"No it's not just beer, it's all sorts of german stuff."
20-05-2018T00:22:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Sounds fancy
20-05-2018T00:22:32,unsteddyphoenix,Does. Not sure ive had German food before
20-05-2018T00:22:51,unsteddyphoenix,German resteraunts are rare
20-05-2018T00:23:40,Twokinds,Cincinnati has a lot of german food and celebrations
20-05-2018T00:23:58,Twokinds,A lot of Germans settled in Cinci originally
20-05-2018T00:25:01,unsteddyphoenix,Interesting.
20-05-2018T00:25:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I see their menu is in half German
20-05-2018T00:25:18,unsteddyphoenix,"I kinda wanna do one of those ancestry.com things, just to look for stuff like that"
20-05-2018T00:25:33,unsteddyphoenix,See when people travelled and settled where
20-05-2018T00:28:08,SpazztasticKiwi,What kind of celebrations
20-05-2018T00:28:55,Twokinds,beerfest!
20-05-2018T00:29:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Eh
20-05-2018T00:29:24,TrexM,are we breaking or we done?
20-05-2018T00:29:27,unsteddyphoenix,Oktoberfest?
20-05-2018T00:29:27,Twokinds,it's not just beer
20-05-2018T00:29:34,Twokinds,Yes oktoberfest
20-05-2018T00:29:45,unsteddyphoenix,Which is also a beer fest as I understand
20-05-2018T00:29:45,Twokinds,"Although a lot of it is about beer, because it's... german"
20-05-2018T00:29:59,unsteddyphoenix,hooray stereotypes~ \o/
20-05-2018T00:30:08,SpazztasticKiwi,"It’s tempting to travel up there and see, but I don’t know what I’d do since I don’t drink"
20-05-2018T00:30:17,Twokinds,I don't drink either but I like the food.
20-05-2018T00:30:23,Twokinds,It's very... hearty.
20-05-2018T00:30:23,Vatruvius,"Okay, I cannot play this game and check in so I am getting off. Goodnight everyone! :ptv-greetings:"
20-05-2018T00:30:29,Twokinds,Bye!
20-05-2018T00:30:30,unsteddyphoenix,later
20-05-2018T00:30:36,SpazztasticKiwi,You mean fattening
20-05-2018T00:30:37,unsteddyphoenix,Like big stews and things?
20-05-2018T00:30:41,TrexM,bye
20-05-2018T00:30:48,Twokinds,"Also yeah, Trex, stream is over. a while ago"
20-05-2018T00:30:56,unsteddyphoenix,juuuust missed it
20-05-2018T00:31:15,Twokinds,We're just hanging out.
20-05-2018T00:31:23,SpazztasticKiwi,My cousin’s supposed to be getting married up there soon so who knows
20-05-2018T00:31:58,unsteddyphoenix,germany? Or Ohio?
20-05-2018T00:32:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Ohio
20-05-2018T00:32:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not traveling to Germany for a wedding
20-05-2018T00:33:06,Twokinds,Why not? Germany is nice.
20-05-2018T00:33:30,unsteddyphoenix,I actually thought you were gonna say germany lol
20-05-2018T00:34:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"It’s nice but my German isn’t good, and I’m not sure about traveling out of country"
20-05-2018T00:34:58,unsteddyphoenix,Just be a loud obnoxious tourist
20-05-2018T00:35:18,unsteddyphoenix,a lot of them speak english anyway i'd bet
20-05-2018T00:35:39,unsteddyphoenix,"I remember trying to talk to Italians in Italy, and they'd recognise my shitty accent and switch to english"
20-05-2018T00:36:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe to sightsee or see if I can find some distant relatives but other than that I’d probably prefer domestic travel
20-05-2018T00:36:04,unsteddyphoenix,It was both considerate and extremely annoying
20-05-2018T00:36:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Tbh my accent is probably a bit offensive. I feel I butcher my German whenever I speak it
20-05-2018T00:36:55,unsteddyphoenix,Suppose America is huge enough that it's different in every state
20-05-2018T00:37:21,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s an art museum I want to see in Arizona
20-05-2018T00:37:39,SpazztasticKiwi,And I kinda want to see LA
20-05-2018T00:37:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I’d be more likely to go to visit my grandpa in San Francisco
20-05-2018T00:38:44,Twokinds,"With VR, no need to travel at all!"
20-05-2018T00:39:15,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s cheating :ctwokinds-floAAA:
20-05-2018T00:39:20,unsteddyphoenix,VR family members!
20-05-2018T00:39:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Now that’s something I’d go for
20-05-2018T00:39:46,unsteddyphoenix,lol
20-05-2018T00:40:11,unsteddyphoenix,90% of the fun of travelling is eating the food though~
20-05-2018T00:40:26,SpazztasticKiwi,I hear a few people say Alabama is nice because we have a bunch of pretty flowers and country
20-05-2018T00:40:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m just like :ctwokinds-katwet:
20-05-2018T00:41:18,unsteddyphoenix,Same~
20-05-2018T00:41:37,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t stay too long - they’ll eat you alive here
20-05-2018T00:41:42,unsteddyphoenix,We have lotsa nice wildlife 'n things...outside
20-05-2018T00:43:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I got a few looks when I went to PAX
20-05-2018T00:44:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Accent turns heads sometimes
20-05-2018T00:45:44,unsteddyphoenix,classic southern accent?
20-05-2018T00:45:46,unsteddyphoenix,Like in the movies?
20-05-2018T00:46:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Never believe a southern accent in a movie. They’re stupid
20-05-2018T00:46:14,unsteddyphoenix,Awww...
20-05-2018T00:46:42,SpazztasticKiwi,The ones who do sound like that are often the ones you may want to avoid
20-05-2018T00:48:02,SpazztasticKiwi,The Walking Dead’s Negan is an example of the “southern plantation owner” or “rich southerner” accent
20-05-2018T00:48:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"Cool for a bit but then it starts to annoy me, especially when I know it’s someone just mocking the accent"
20-05-2018T00:49:32,unsteddyphoenix,Lol
20-05-2018T00:49:44,unsteddyphoenix,Is he mocking it?
20-05-2018T00:50:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"To an extent, but it’s part of his character. Some people do sound like that, it’s just they’re not always in the position people thing that accent goes"
20-05-2018T00:51:00,SpazztasticKiwi,The same actor is in Rampage
20-05-2018T00:51:58,SpazztasticKiwi,"He’s good, and I like him. Probably because he leans into his characters so heavy"
20-05-2018T00:52:04,unsteddyphoenix,I only played the walking dead games but I think i've watched an analysis of Negan
20-05-2018T00:52:13,unsteddyphoenix,"He's the villian with like, a bat or something right?"
20-05-2018T00:52:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m not a fan of The Walking Dead. It’s become too much of a soap opra
20-05-2018T00:52:48,unsteddyphoenix,"They talked about his method of control and his philosophy, it was pretty interesting"
20-05-2018T00:53:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"I can go for a drama, but there needs to be flavor to it"
20-05-2018T00:53:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Criminal Minds is my fote
20-05-2018T00:53:58,unsteddyphoenix,"That seems to be the general consensus, from what I see"
20-05-2018T00:54:02,SpazztasticKiwi,*forte
20-05-2018T00:55:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m still annoyed that they killed Jason Gidion
20-05-2018T00:58:34,SpazztasticKiwi,"He’s played by Mandy Patinkin, who was Indigo Montoya in the Princess Bride"
20-05-2018T00:59:59,unsteddyphoenix,Ooo~
20-05-2018T01:00:06,unsteddyphoenix,I never knew that guy got more work lol
20-05-2018T01:00:10,unsteddyphoenix,What a good movie
20-05-2018T01:02:29,Twokinds,I haven't seen it
20-05-2018T01:03:47,unsteddyphoenix,"The title put me off originally, but I liked it"
20-05-2018T01:03:53,unsteddyphoenix,Havent seen it in ages though
20-05-2018T01:07:33,SpazztasticKiwi,YOU HAVENT SEEN IT
20-05-2018T01:08:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I think I just lost a few years off
20-05-2018T01:08:13,SpazztasticKiwi,my life
20-05-2018T01:08:59,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s a masterpiece
20-05-2018T01:09:03,unsteddyphoenix,"Its not starwars, so he hasnt seen it~"
20-05-2018T01:09:06,SpazztasticKiwi,A classic
20-05-2018T01:09:16,unsteddyphoenix,Are you gonna see Solo this weekend tom?
20-05-2018T01:10:38,SpazztasticKiwi,And are you going...
20-05-2018T01:10:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Solo?
20-05-2018T01:10:56,unsteddyphoenix,:thumbsdown::thumbsdown::thumbsdown::thumbsdown:
20-05-2018T01:11:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Oh come on
20-05-2018T01:11:56,Twokinds,What's Solo?
20-05-2018T01:12:18,unsteddyphoenix,The...Han Solo movie
20-05-2018T01:12:31,Twokinds,"Oh, is that coming out soon?"
20-05-2018T01:12:46,Twokinds,I don't know if I'm gunna see it or not.
20-05-2018T01:12:53,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah like, thursday"
20-05-2018T01:13:04,unsteddyphoenix,No?
20-05-2018T01:13:21,Twokinds,"Huh, really? I wonder why Sage never mentioned wanting to see it."
20-05-2018T01:13:26,unsteddyphoenix,Im not that interested myself  but I dont have the nostalgia~
20-05-2018T01:14:10,unsteddyphoenix,Shrug. Is he a big star war fan?
20-05-2018T01:15:49,Twokinds,"I mean he's a nerd, of course he is."
20-05-2018T01:15:55,SpazztasticKiwi,I know the theater in Tupelo is likely to show it for a few weeks. Infinity War was so popular it got a 3D and regular screening for a good week and a half at least
20-05-2018T01:16:17,Twokinds,I'm a huge star wars fan... but not a huge disney star wars fan.
20-05-2018T01:16:22,unsteddyphoenix,Nerds...
20-05-2018T01:16:45,unsteddyphoenix,"Aha, I feel that. I havent really liked the ones ive seen."
20-05-2018T01:16:51,unsteddyphoenix,Rogue one was ok I guess.
20-05-2018T01:17:16,unsteddyphoenix,The originals were on tv recently and I still had more fun watching those
20-05-2018T01:19:10,unsteddyphoenix,"Unending Combat was pretty good, even though im not a big superhero fan"
20-05-2018T01:19:36,unsteddyphoenix,"But I like the idea of a big interwoven story, thats really cool"
20-05-2018T01:23:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I like big plots and I can’t deny...
20-05-2018T01:28:38,Bgrmystr2,"tom, did you end up finishing the page? or when do you think youll finish and post it up? jus curious"
20-05-2018T01:29:23,Bgrmystr2,"also, my help for packing went home for the night. just all byyyy myyselff now"

20-05-2018T01:31:32,Bgrmystr2,"no problem, was just wondering. Take your time. If you got no time, then no big deal. :)"

20-05-2018T02:11:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Going to bed?
20-05-2018T02:12:28,SpazztasticKiwi,I was just watching a video with kittens mewing and I look over at Bagheera and he was like :ctwokinds-keith8D:
20-05-2018T02:13:21,Twokinds,Yeah so tired
20-05-2018T02:13:36,Twokinds,"The good thing about working out again, no trouble falling asleep."
20-05-2018T02:16:34,SpazztasticKiwi,At least you won’t get fired if you show up late at work tomorrow
20-05-2018T02:17:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Just flop into bed whenever you please. And sleep like the dead when you get there
20-05-2018T02:17:17,Twokinds,Mondays are my day off so I'd hope not.
20-05-2018T02:17:28,Twokinds,My boss is a pain though. Always making me work extra shifts.
20-05-2018T02:20:40,unsteddyphoenix,You should form a union
20-05-2018T02:20:57,unsteddyphoenix,Band together with your fellow workers
20-05-2018T02:21:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Won’t let you share with coworkers?
20-05-2018T02:21:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Or won’t hire any more workers?
20-05-2018T02:22:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Monday’s off is a bit strange. Normally it’s a day you’ll never get off
20-05-2018T02:22:44,unsteddyphoenix,Dont have to deal with that monday traffic though
20-05-2018T02:22:54,unsteddyphoenix,Seems sweet
20-05-2018T02:25:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Extra shifts is a killer though. Maybe you can ask for the ability to bring in a massager for your chair
20-05-2018T02:28:14,Bgrmystr2,or.. just buy a massage chair. put it in as a work expense
20-05-2018T02:28:27,Bgrmystr2,write it off your taxes :v
20-05-2018T02:29:17,Bgrmystr2,having to sit / stand for hours and hours at a time drawing is gonna play hell with muscles and stuff. gotta unstiff sometime.
20-05-2018T02:29:48,unsteddyphoenix,traditionally drugs have filled that role
20-05-2018T02:31:09,SpazztasticKiwi,I have a back massager myself. Bagheera watches it move like it’s possessed
20-05-2018T02:32:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though if you’re tied Tom, go to bed. It’ll hurt things more to stay up"
20-05-2018T02:32:10,SpazztasticKiwi,*tired
20-05-2018T02:32:50,Bgrmystr2,"medicine muscle relaxers are not great to take on a constant basis though, if I recall correctly"
20-05-2018T02:33:00,Bgrmystr2,hence why having a natural relaxer would be better
20-05-2018T03:23:29,DarthRexKing,I am going to bed. Bye.
20-05-2018T14:19:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I did something weird today and woke up early
20-05-2018T14:20:59,Twokinds,:ptv-shock:
20-05-2018T14:22:45,SpazztasticKiwi,I know right
20-05-2018T14:23:06,SpazztasticKiwi,I panicked at first thinking I’d missed my alarm
20-05-2018T14:26:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Also it’s like 90 degrees and I have to wear black pants and a dark shirt. Might melt
20-05-2018T14:38:21,Twokinds,Don't melt!
20-05-2018T14:38:37,Twokinds,It's 86 here right now.
20-05-2018T14:39:33,SpazztasticKiwi,You get to stay inside
20-05-2018T14:39:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless you’re mowing the lawn...again
20-05-2018T14:40:25,Twokinds,I did mow the lawn about an hour ago
20-05-2018T14:40:43,Twokinds,It's quite a workout.
20-05-2018T14:42:25,SpazztasticKiwi,"If it’s with a push mower or weed wackier, I believe it"
20-05-2018T14:44:20,SpazztasticKiwi,*wacker
20-05-2018T14:45:12,SpazztasticKiwi,That must be the workout routine you’re drinking the shakes for :ptv-condescending:
20-05-2018T14:50:06,Twokinds,Remote control electric mower
20-05-2018T14:50:23,Twokinds,"But I have to sit outside the whole time! Man, so much work."
20-05-2018T14:50:56,Dadrobit,I'm just imaining someone trying to mow a lawn by flying a drone reeeeealy close to the ground.
20-05-2018T14:51:07,Twokinds,XD
20-05-2018T14:51:18,Twokinds,"Yeah, that'd be fun."
20-05-2018T14:53:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t give anyone any ideas. There’s always an idiot that’ll try it if they haven’t already
20-05-2018T14:54:36,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll be back in a few hours
20-05-2018T14:56:19,Dadrobit,"Cya later, spazz."
20-05-2018T15:04:19,Dadrobit,"Neice is sick, she's gonna hang out at my place for a bit."
20-05-2018T15:04:25,Dadrobit,So leaving myself for a couple.
20-05-2018T15:05:09,Dadrobit,Gonna head over to my mom's school after neice is gone to help her finish up some grading as well.
20-05-2018T15:20:58,Twokinds,Aw sorry to hear that
20-05-2018T15:21:00,Twokinds,Being sick sucks
20-05-2018T15:32:13,ThingsAreMoving,"Maaan, doing physical work in high temperature should be regulated by law. Additional breaks, and free ice cream for starters"
20-05-2018T15:45:24,Bgrmystr2,gmornin
20-05-2018T15:45:45,Bgrmystr2,"if today was sunday, I'd have missed 45 mins of stream.."
20-05-2018T15:48:53,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: guess I should get food and get back to packing..
20-05-2018T16:09:50,Dadrobit,"It kind of is. OSHA created a ""heat index"" and provides basic guidelines for working in the heat."
20-05-2018T16:10:34,Dadrobit,https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/heatillness/heat_index/pdfs/all_in_one.pdf
20-05-2018T16:13:07,Dadrobit,"Mandatory additional breaks are definitely a thing, and maybe if you have a decent boss, you can convince them that ice cream is considered a valid form of preventative maintenance for preventing heat illness."
20-05-2018T17:05:39,Twokinds,Mandatory breaks? I should tell my boss about this.
20-05-2018T17:32:26,ThingsAreMoving,"Yeah, Dad. Thing is, that's just a guideline. Over here, in the UK there is no statutory maximum working temperature established. Today I've measured 37.5C (99.5F) in my workplace, and it's not even summer yet."
20-05-2018T17:33:43,ThingsAreMoving,"Things™ are going to be hot, pretty soon. :ctwokinds-renirawr:"
20-05-2018T17:45:39,SpazztasticKiwi,We have a bit of an opposite problem. Our freezer doesn’t shut proper and that makes ice build up
20-05-2018T17:46:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don’t care how non slide your shoes are, you may end up on your butt in there"
20-05-2018T17:46:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I just spent twenty minutes chipping and removing ice build up
20-05-2018T17:48:16,ThingsAreMoving,Shouldn't that be a weekly preventive maintenance?
20-05-2018T17:51:46,SpazztasticKiwi,It shouldn’t exist
20-05-2018T17:52:43,SpazztasticKiwi,The door should close when it’s supposed to but it needs to be replaced
20-05-2018T17:53:14,SpazztasticKiwi,And they’re not showing they aim to replace it
20-05-2018T17:54:32,ThingsAreMoving,"Until someone slips, and cracks their skull open"
20-05-2018T17:55:24,Bgrmystr2,"Safety hazard, that."
20-05-2018T17:55:28,Bgrmystr2,Report it
20-05-2018T17:55:31,Bgrmystr2,:u
20-05-2018T17:57:14,ThingsAreMoving,That it is. You should report it even if just as an insurance. If you'd have an accident after that report you could file a large claim and win pretty fast.
20-05-2018T17:58:50,ThingsAreMoving,"Had that before. I reported that a machine needed some guards, but noone cared, and one day I nearly had my little finger ripped off."
20-05-2018T17:59:45,ThingsAreMoving,"Filed a claim, got the money, but lost some mobility in that finger."
20-05-2018T18:01:13,Bgrmystr2,:/
20-05-2018T18:01:19,Bgrmystr2,this is why we can't have nice things
20-05-2018T18:01:28,Bgrmystr2,cuz that's negligence
20-05-2018T18:02:02,Bgrmystr2,did you get the money just for the claim? Or because you were injured because they wouldn't fix it?
20-05-2018T18:02:51,ThingsAreMoving,"just for the claim, but I had that report in the evidence I've collected for the case"
20-05-2018T18:03:13,ThingsAreMoving,It pushed the thing forward pretty fast
20-05-2018T18:03:41,SpazztasticKiwi,They’ve been told but without an accident there doesn’t seem to be much else we can do unless a surprise inspector pops in
20-05-2018T18:04:15,SpazztasticKiwi,"That happens, they get in trouble and they may actually shut the store down"
20-05-2018T18:05:01,SpazztasticKiwi,I have to go back in but I have a story about the sink that I can tell you later
20-05-2018T18:05:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Just remind me
20-05-2018T18:05:51,ThingsAreMoving,"I have to go to sleep pretty soon, I think I'll be popping here 'round the time bgr woke up today."
20-05-2018T18:06:01,ThingsAreMoving,"Seems pretty chill, even without the stream on."
20-05-2018T18:09:36,Bgrmystr2,"you should anonymously suggest an inspection, kiwi"
20-05-2018T18:09:54,Bgrmystr2,cuz that's how you get shit fixed'
20-05-2018T18:10:32,Bgrmystr2,you call up an inspection agency as a 'anonymous' who's seen stuff that's not up to code and the management won't fix it
20-05-2018T18:10:52,Bgrmystr2,least.. it works down here.
20-05-2018T18:10:57,Bgrmystr2,people HATE it though :v
20-05-2018T18:11:05,Bgrmystr2,cuz everyone here halfasses everything
20-05-2018T18:11:44,Bgrmystr2,"good riddence, I say. If they're gonna let safety hazards slide, they don't deserve to be in charge in the first place."
20-05-2018T18:12:04,Bgrmystr2,that's always top priority.
20-05-2018T18:12:26,ThingsAreMoving,true that
20-05-2018T18:50:19,Combak,"So, is something happening or are you all lurking?"
20-05-2018T18:51:51,Bgrmystr2,lurking as usual
20-05-2018T18:52:07,Bgrmystr2,I'm packing atm. moving this weekend and next week
20-05-2018T18:54:48,Combak,Cool.
20-05-2018T18:54:50,Combak,Have fun?
20-05-2018T18:55:38,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-confused: I.. :ptv-sad:
20-05-2018T18:55:45,Bgrmystr2,my everything hurts lol
20-05-2018T19:06:10,Dadrobit,Just got back from helping my mom grade some work at her school.
20-05-2018T19:06:24,Dadrobit,I may have to do something unspeakable in the very near future.
20-05-2018T19:06:37,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
20-05-2018T19:06:41,Dadrobit,My beard might have to go....
20-05-2018T19:07:06,Bgrmystr2,It'll grow bag
20-05-2018T19:07:09,Bgrmystr2,back* even..
20-05-2018T19:07:11,Bgrmystr2,&gt;.&gt;
20-05-2018T19:07:17,Dadrobit,"So while I was there, two of her students were in the classroom with us."
20-05-2018T19:07:40,Dadrobit,"They saw me and said, ""Mrs. So-and-so! Is that your husband?!?"""
20-05-2018T19:07:53,Bgrmystr2,lool
20-05-2018T19:08:42,Bgrmystr2,"what does it matter though? If you like your beard, keep it"
20-05-2018T19:08:48,Bgrmystr2,"it's your beard, not theirs"
20-05-2018T19:08:59,Bgrmystr2,don't shave it unless YOU want to
20-05-2018T19:09:02,Dadrobit,"Mostly I keep it for my grandma, she likes it best."
20-05-2018T19:09:03,Bgrmystr2,for you.
20-05-2018T19:09:06,Bgrmystr2,xD
20-05-2018T19:09:13,Dadrobit,I prefer a goatee.
20-05-2018T19:09:31,Bgrmystr2,"then do that, imo lol"
20-05-2018T19:09:42,Bgrmystr2,I just let my face do w/e till it gets in the way
20-05-2018T19:09:58,Bgrmystr2,then I get rid of it
20-05-2018T19:10:20,Dadrobit,"I don't mind having a beard, just prefer the goatee, less to keep combed."
20-05-2018T19:10:37,Dadrobit,It's just that it ages me just a wee bit too much it seems.
20-05-2018T19:10:55,Bgrmystr2,"lolol, shouldn't bother you though"
20-05-2018T19:11:30,Dadrobit,You mean I shouldn't take the opinions of 16 year old girls to heart?
20-05-2018T19:11:38,Dadrobit,**GASP**
20-05-2018T19:11:40,Bgrmystr2,yes
20-05-2018T19:11:42,Bgrmystr2,yes I am
20-05-2018T19:11:49,Bgrmystr2,"because your face is yours, not hers."
20-05-2018T19:12:00,Bgrmystr2,ain't none of her business what you look like :v
20-05-2018T19:12:06,Bgrmystr2,you have your reasons for lookin like dat
20-05-2018T19:12:16,Dadrobit,Laziness mostly.
20-05-2018T19:12:20,Bgrmystr2,xD
20-05-2018T19:12:24,Bgrmystr2,know that feel
20-05-2018T19:13:05,Bgrmystr2,"dadro, do you know about bluetooth connections to car stereos?"
20-05-2018T19:13:42,Dadrobit,Can't say that I do other than usually they co-operate pretty well.
20-05-2018T19:13:50,Bgrmystr2,"hm, okay"
20-05-2018T19:14:02,Dadrobit,My own car doesn't even have an aux-in though....
20-05-2018T19:14:09,Bgrmystr2,"cuz I was thinking of getting a car stereo, setting it up in my room, and getting a bluetooth adapter for my pc"
20-05-2018T19:14:55,Dadrobit,"Define the stereo. Do you mean just the console, or the speakers?"
20-05-2018T19:15:12,Bgrmystr2,"oh, just the console itself so I can attach the speakers to it."
20-05-2018T19:15:41,Bgrmystr2,I was trying to find a stereo with a usb input so I can stream audio live to it instead of how most car stereos just read audio files
20-05-2018T19:15:58,Bgrmystr2,but a friend of mine said I could probably get a bluetooth card for my pc and stream audio that way
20-05-2018T19:16:18,Bgrmystr2,I just would need to power the thing inside the house.
20-05-2018T19:16:35,Dadrobit,Why not just hard wire it to your PC? Bluetooth is gonna affect the quality.
20-05-2018T19:17:03,Bgrmystr2,"Well, that was my original intent, I wanted a USB connection, but they don't seem to exist the way I want it"
20-05-2018T19:17:09,Dadrobit,"Like, get a sound card and hook up the computer directly to the speakers"
20-05-2018T19:17:13,Twokinds,I literally could not remember the spot's name for a good minutes
20-05-2018T19:17:41,Bgrmystr2,"my speakers aren't plugs like that, they're all like.. the freyed wires or whatnot"
20-05-2018T19:18:04,Dadrobit,"Mmm, so a little soldering is in order."
20-05-2018T19:18:25,Dadrobit,"What spot, Tom?"
20-05-2018T19:18:30,Twokinds,Kathrin
20-05-2018T19:18:38,Bgrmystr2,xDD..
20-05-2018T19:18:39,Dadrobit,Hahahahahahaha!
20-05-2018T19:18:44,Bgrmystr2,poor spots..
20-05-2018T19:19:06,unsteddyphoenix,Thats an upsetting thing to wake up to.

20-05-2018T19:20:46,unsteddyphoenix,Its like 11am~
20-05-2018T19:20:55,unsteddyphoenix,overslept
20-05-2018T19:21:36,Dadrobit,"Well, you could always get a home theatre reciver for about the same price as a car stereo, they all have USB/Bluetooth and a million other configurations nowadays."
20-05-2018T19:22:14,Dadrobit,No need to go jury rigging things with that.
20-05-2018T19:23:43,Bgrmystr2,hm
20-05-2018T19:23:45,Bgrmystr2,maybe
20-05-2018T19:24:00,Bgrmystr2,11am for you is like 7pm here

20-05-2018T19:27:31,Dadrobit,Easy
20-05-2018T19:27:49,Bgrmystr2,most the car stereos I see around here are $40-90
20-05-2018T19:27:53,unsteddyphoenix,I would never have guessed that much damn
20-05-2018T19:28:03,Bgrmystr2,the stores don't carry anything above $100 for car stereos
20-05-2018T19:28:10,Dadrobit,When they start getting screens and nav systems they can be $600+
20-05-2018T19:28:12,Bgrmystr2,prolly cuz they'd just be stolen lol
20-05-2018T19:28:37,Bgrmystr2,can you connect an amplifier to it to power subs?
20-05-2018T19:30:44,Bgrmystr2,"I don't really need anything too expensive, just something to connect the speakers to the pc, and the subs to an amp to my pc, and to do it with usb or some type of digital audio connection"
20-05-2018T19:31:34,Dadrobit,"The one I link has a built in amp for subs, it's built for 5.1"

20-05-2018T19:31:58,Bgrmystr2,it's not gonna power multiple subs though xD
20-05-2018T19:32:17,Dadrobit,Y tho?
20-05-2018T19:32:28,Bgrmystr2,cuz that's what I have :/
20-05-2018T19:33:05,Dadrobit,Like... You have multiple subwoofers?
20-05-2018T19:33:07,Bgrmystr2,"four subs, four midrange, four misc tweeters and a horn tweeter"
20-05-2018T19:33:09,Bgrmystr2,yes
20-05-2018T19:33:19,Bgrmystr2,"a 6, a 12, and two 15s"
20-05-2018T19:33:36,Dadrobit,Your neighbors must love you.
20-05-2018T19:33:52,Bgrmystr2,"I have a couple midrange 6.5s, and prolly a couple 4s, if I had to guess"
20-05-2018T19:34:11,Bgrmystr2,"they don't need to worry about me, I don't own an amp to power em. my stereo's only 330 watt lol"
20-05-2018T19:34:18,Combak,Hey Tom?
20-05-2018T19:35:00,Bgrmystr2,"they gotta worry about the guy I live with, he's got 6+ 15's, 18' subcompacts, multiple rows of 4 horntweeters, dj system, etc etc"
20-05-2018T19:35:14,Bgrmystr2,and the neighbors worry that THEY make too much noise for us :v
20-05-2018T19:37:08,Dadrobit,That's approaching a level of power consumption that you're not going to get from a regular outlet lol.

20-05-2018T19:37:40,unsteddyphoenix,relatable
20-05-2018T19:38:43,Bgrmystr2,WELL okay then
20-05-2018T19:38:57,Bgrmystr2,I still think bed-chan is one of the best
20-05-2018T19:40:57,Dadrobit,"Closest to being a DJ I ever got to was remixing Ace of Bass - All That She Wants, lol. What is your roomate's workstation?"
20-05-2018T19:41:14,Dadrobit,"And quality upload unsteddy, thank you."
20-05-2018T19:41:35,Combak,... More of a link than an upload. XD
20-05-2018T19:42:51,unsteddyphoenix,"Hey I could be that guy, you dont know~"
20-05-2018T19:43:57,Dadrobit,"I can't imagine you as that guy. I need to be able to read all of your text in that sweet, sweet, NZ accent."
20-05-2018T19:44:34,unsteddyphoenix,the sexiest accent known to man
20-05-2018T19:44:44,unsteddyphoenix,"apart from, pretty much all other accents"
20-05-2018T19:51:33,Dadrobit,"Hey, at least you don't sound like ""a damned grinding stone""."
20-05-2018T19:52:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I was referencing that you have a rolling voice
20-05-2018T19:52:43,Vatruvius,:ptv-greetings:
20-05-2018T19:52:56,SpazztasticKiwi,Would you rather have wanted me to call it “gravelly old man”?
20-05-2018T19:53:30,unsteddyphoenix,I enjoy the gurgaling gravel aesthetic
20-05-2018T19:54:06,Dadrobit,I've already been called a gravelly old man once today already...
20-05-2018T19:54:22,Bgrmystr2,lol Dadro I don't know what he's using honestly. It seems pretty old though
20-05-2018T19:56:04,Vatruvius,This has been the least productive day I have ever had in a long while and it was great!
20-05-2018T19:58:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Then you can take some of my workload
20-05-2018T19:59:12,Dadrobit,I think I'm gonna keep the beard. Maybe I'm just meant to be an old man....
20-05-2018T19:59:28,SpazztasticKiwi,👴
20-05-2018T20:00:01,Dadrobit,"Excuse me, but my hair is full, flowing, and luxurious!"
20-05-2018T20:00:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Ok Fabio calm down
20-05-2018T20:00:38,Vatruvius,"No think you Kiwi, slowing grinding up to better metals in My Little Blacksmith Shop is hard enough work. :ptv-tease:"
20-05-2018T20:01:05,Vatruvius,thank*
20-05-2018T20:04:25,SpazztasticKiwi,In my experience there’s a few different types of male voices
20-05-2018T20:05:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Also I have cake
20-05-2018T20:06:11,Vatruvius,I have root bear. :D
20-05-2018T20:06:16,SpazztasticKiwi,Ew
20-05-2018T20:06:29,Vatruvius,:ptv-shock:
20-05-2018T20:06:52,Vatruvius,Root beer is great!
20-05-2018T20:07:12,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s nasty is what it is
20-05-2018T20:07:25,Vatruvius,"Well, more for me."
20-05-2018T20:08:22,Vatruvius,"I don't like the mass produced root beer, I like real root bear."
20-05-2018T20:08:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"I don’t like it at all. Used to, but I’m more for coke now"
20-05-2018T20:09:50,Vatruvius,My diet has changed so much. I have been off of soda for so long that I cannot go back to normal soda. Brewed root beer is the closest I can get and I have no problem with that.
20-05-2018T20:11:00,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve gotten to where I don’t eat alot of sugar or salty or oily stuff
20-05-2018T20:11:09,Dadrobit,There are only two male voices that I am aware of.
20-05-2018T20:11:13,Dadrobit,1) My own
20-05-2018T20:11:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Sexy and squeaky
20-05-2018T20:11:22,Dadrobit,2) The competition that must be crushed.
20-05-2018T20:11:55,Vatruvius,lol
20-05-2018T20:13:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"There’s the bone-rattling, the rolling, the grinding, and the high but still deeper than a girl"
20-05-2018T20:13:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Generally
20-05-2018T20:14:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Kratos is an example of the first
20-05-2018T20:14:52,Dadrobit,BOY
20-05-2018T20:14:55,Vatruvius,Right...
20-05-2018T20:15:15,Vatruvius,I think that tends to go for any killing machine God so...
20-05-2018T20:15:43,SpazztasticKiwi,The first and second are like “read me a bedtime story” good
20-05-2018T20:17:03,SpazztasticKiwi,Watching Mark’s Orcs Must Die series recently by the way
20-05-2018T20:17:57,SpazztasticKiwi,I want to know just one thing
20-05-2018T20:18:12,Dadrobit,"Yeah, reading dr. seuss books to the nieces/nephews ""in the big voice"" was always fun back in the day."
20-05-2018T20:18:14,SpazztasticKiwi,How the hell does that sorceress run around in those heels
20-05-2018T20:19:45,Dadrobit,"One or two still are young enough that they get a kick out of it, the rest area all teens or pre-teens nowadays that want very little to do with that."
20-05-2018T20:20:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Just thought of something
20-05-2018T20:20:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Do they call you Uncle Dad
20-05-2018T20:20:21,Dadrobit,Now they only want my do do voices reading Cards Against Humanity
20-05-2018T20:20:27,Dadrobit,me*
20-05-2018T20:20:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause I surely hope not
20-05-2018T20:20:37,Dadrobit,LMAO
20-05-2018T20:21:27,Dadrobit,"Nah, a couple people in my family call me dad kind of ironically, but the kiddos call me by my name."
20-05-2018T20:22:08,Vatruvius,You aren't actually that old are you Dadro?
20-05-2018T20:22:26,Dadrobit,I certainly feel old today
20-05-2018T20:22:48,Vatruvius,"I mean, I do not picture you older than 35."
20-05-2018T20:22:55,Bgrmystr2,hahahaha
20-05-2018T20:22:58,Bgrmystr2,he's not that old
20-05-2018T20:23:11,Bgrmystr2,"he's in his early/mid 20s, :v"
20-05-2018T20:23:12,Vatruvius,"Yeah, I that was my upper limit."
20-05-2018T20:23:21,Bgrmystr2,I'm the one about to be 30 this year
20-05-2018T20:23:24,SpazztasticKiwi,He is Opa
20-05-2018T20:23:26,Dadrobit,Mid/late 20's actually.
20-05-2018T20:23:31,Bgrmystr2,oh?
20-05-2018T20:23:36,Bgrmystr2,last time I heard you were 24?
20-05-2018T20:23:44,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
20-05-2018T20:23:56,Dadrobit,That was a few years ago then lol.
20-05-2018T20:24:05,Bgrmystr2,hm
20-05-2018T20:24:07,Bgrmystr2,well okay
20-05-2018T20:24:08,Bgrmystr2,xD
20-05-2018T20:25:53,Vatruvius,"I figured you were in your late 20s, not much older. I would be surprised if you were in your thirties but if you were above 35 I would not know what to do."
20-05-2018T20:27:05,SpazztasticKiwi,People in chat have an age requirement. Got it
20-05-2018T20:27:21,Vatruvius,?
20-05-2018T20:28:10,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s nothing
20-05-2018T20:28:34,Vatruvius,:thinking:
20-05-2018T20:29:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Getting someone’s age right just seems to get harder and harder
20-05-2018T20:30:03,Dadrobit,Can't be too old. Like Logan's Run. Except here we get to live up to 35 instead of 30.
20-05-2018T20:30:08,SpazztasticKiwi,16 year olds are looking like they’re 18
20-05-2018T20:30:26,Dadrobit,#QualityDatedReference
20-05-2018T20:30:39,SpazztasticKiwi,And 18 year olds looking like they’re 16
20-05-2018T20:30:46,Dadrobit,#WelcomeToThe23rdCentury
20-05-2018T20:31:08,Bgrmystr2,18 looking like they're 16? Big deal.
20-05-2018T20:31:22,Vatruvius,23rd!
20-05-2018T20:31:25,SpazztasticKiwi,No one has ever got my age right. I’ve gotten a few get close though
20-05-2018T20:31:38,Bgrmystr2,when a girl cards a woman in her 50s.. cuz she can't tell
20-05-2018T20:31:43,Bgrmystr2,you already know.
20-05-2018T20:32:06,Vatruvius,"Well, back to grinding in My Little Blacksmith Shop, bye everyone. I will check in later."
20-05-2018T20:32:09,Vatruvius,:ptv-greetings:
20-05-2018T20:32:15,SpazztasticKiwi,K
20-05-2018T20:32:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll need to go on back soon too
20-05-2018T20:32:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Off at 11 though
20-05-2018T20:33:03,Dadrobit,"Logan's Run was set in the 23rd century. There's a utopia on Earth that requires the population to be heavily controlled. No one lives past 30. Those that attempt escape are hunted down by a ""Sandman""."
20-05-2018T20:33:11,Dadrobit,Cya Vat
20-05-2018T20:37:03,Dadrobit,Gonna head out for a bit myself. Gotta go pick up grandaddy from the airport. Be back in a bit.
20-05-2018T20:42:30,Bgrmystr2,have fun
20-05-2018T22:13:23,Combak,"Hey Tom, you around? I got a quick question."
20-05-2018T22:35:48,Dadrobit,"Back. Plane got delayed, spent a goodly amount of time in the cell phone lot lol."
20-05-2018T22:37:36,unsteddyphoenix,"Oof, that sucks"
20-05-2018T23:05:06,Vatruvius,And I'm back! :ptv-greetings:
20-05-2018T23:16:21,SpazztasticKiwi,And I’m off work
20-05-2018T23:19:33,Vatruvius,Congratulations.
20-05-2018T23:20:30,Dadrobit,"Ughhhh, GoW may have finally beaten me."
20-05-2018T23:20:57,Dadrobit,"There's an ""Impossible Challenge"" arena fight where you have to beat 20 enemies without taking damage."
20-05-2018T23:21:39,Dadrobit,"And when you get down to 5 enemies left, it brings in a boss to the arena that is invulnerable to damage except for when it's doing a certain attack."
20-05-2018T23:21:49,Twokinds,That sounds difficult.
20-05-2018T23:21:52,Vatruvius,"GoW - Gears of War? In either case, 20 enemies and no damage sound impossible for most games."
20-05-2018T23:21:56,Dadrobit,An attack that spews out a bunch of AOE projectiles.
20-05-2018T23:22:05,Vatruvius,lol
20-05-2018T23:22:13,Dadrobit,God ofWar
20-05-2018T23:22:17,Dadrobit,of War*
20-05-2018T23:22:21,Vatruvius,Ah...that sound better.
20-05-2018T23:22:36,Vatruvius,Nothing like a good old trophy hunt...
20-05-2018T23:23:17,Dadrobit,And the only way to really attack it is my throwing your axe at it's chest where all of the projectiles are being spewed out from.
20-05-2018T23:23:22,Dadrobit,is by*
20-05-2018T23:23:43,Dadrobit,"But to throw the axe, you slow down to a walking speed."
20-05-2018T23:24:28,Dadrobit,Legit feels like it's 100% down to RNG luck that one of the projectiles doesn't land near you when you're aiming it.
20-05-2018T23:24:30,Vatruvius,Sounds like you need some abilities that do not require you to take damage.
20-05-2018T23:24:41,Vatruvius,Doesn't Kratos' son have some abilities like that?
20-05-2018T23:25:57,Dadrobit,"Yeah, you can do a summon once every minute and a half or so to do some chipping damage."
20-05-2018T23:28:23,SpazztasticKiwi,BOY
20-05-2018T23:29:24,SpazztasticKiwi,Lemme tell you guys something tho. I felt a spider on my foot just a minute ago and I’m so glad I looked before kicking my foot cause it turned out to be the kitten sniffing my toe
20-05-2018T23:35:22,Bgrmystr2,I wouldn't have kicked my foot. my first reaction would be to pull it backwards away from whatever it was
20-05-2018T23:39:20,unsteddyphoenix,Spiders are people too
20-05-2018T23:39:33,Bgrmystr2,spiders aren't people at all
20-05-2018T23:39:42,Bgrmystr2,they're creepy-crawlys
20-05-2018T23:39:51,Bgrmystr2,they are alive though :thinking:
20-05-2018T23:45:02,Vatruvius,My desk as a metal plate going across the back at shin level so I have learned from many a kick to pull away.
20-05-2018T23:49:10,Twokinds,is making soup
20-05-2018T23:53:51,Vatruvius,is now thinking about soup.
20-05-2018T23:54:09,SpazztasticKiwi,But you’re on a diet :ptv-shock:
20-05-2018T23:54:11,unsteddyphoenix,Same. Making lentils~
20-05-2018T23:54:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, I finally ordered Peeka some more mice"
