18-04-2018T00:01:07,TheBeckoner,y'all quit talkin about this stuff...too many sads. Night y'all. :ptv-sneakysmirk:
18-04-2018T00:04:45,Bgrmystr2,gnight beck :o
18-04-2018T00:31:05,Twokinds,I'm so frustrated working on this chapter 20 title page art.
18-04-2018T00:32:29,Bgrmystr2,:/ I hope you get it workin right for ya
18-04-2018T00:32:37,unsteddyphoenix,Thats what you were working on last stream right?
18-04-2018T00:33:46,unsteddyphoenix,"las tfriday stream, I think?"
18-04-2018T00:34:00,unsteddyphoenix,Before the Niiharis
18-04-2018T00:34:14,Twokinds,Yeah
18-04-2018T00:34:18,Twokinds,I just suck at title pages
18-04-2018T00:34:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Thought you went to bed
18-04-2018T00:35:12,SpazztasticKiwi,But distracted by work is probably more logical
18-04-2018T00:36:02,unsteddyphoenix,"Lol, do you?"
18-04-2018T00:36:31,Twokinds,I want chapter 20 to be a calm before the storm. Just a short chapter where the characters can all interact sorta relaxed before stuff hits the fan for chapter 21
18-04-2018T00:36:59,unsteddyphoenix,:O
18-04-2018T00:37:00,Vatruvius,Hmm...:thinking:
18-04-2018T00:37:05,SpazztasticKiwi,"“Ok, everything is written out, all the plans are in order. Time for a title page” *mind blanks*"
18-04-2018T00:37:13,Twokinds,yeah
18-04-2018T00:37:13,unsteddyphoenix,That sketch page looked pretty ominous
18-04-2018T00:37:15,Twokinds,I got nothing
18-04-2018T00:37:57,Vatruvius,I rather liked that sketch page...but given that chapter 20 is the calm before the storm that sketch seems more suiting for chapter 21...though I do not know.
18-04-2018T00:37:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe it’ll hit you when you get back home in May or something
18-04-2018T00:38:09,unsteddyphoenix,"Do you not like the look of what you have, or are having trouble with some details"
18-04-2018T00:38:30,unsteddyphoenix,May would be...a bit long.
18-04-2018T00:38:59,Twokinds,That stuff is chapter 21
18-04-2018T00:39:20,Vatruvius,Okay...let me think then...
18-04-2018T00:39:24,Twokinds,Chapter 20 is the beach episode
18-04-2018T00:39:43,Vatruvius,As in a literal beach?
18-04-2018T00:40:04,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-ohmy::ptv-excited: Beach episode?!
18-04-2018T00:40:09,Bgrmystr2,I am game.
18-04-2018T00:40:17,unsteddyphoenix,"Lol, if only"
18-04-2018T00:40:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Is it bad that I immediately thought of someone getting stung by a jellyfish
18-04-2018T00:40:22,Bgrmystr2,All in. 157%
18-04-2018T00:40:34,Twokinds,The beach room in Trace's estate.
18-04-2018T00:40:43,Bgrmystr2,He better have one
18-04-2018T00:40:46,Bgrmystr2,you better not be kidding
18-04-2018T00:40:50,Bgrmystr2,Or I'll be disappoint
18-04-2018T00:41:04,unsteddyphoenix,What kind of evil megalomaniac wouldnt honestly
18-04-2018T00:41:11,Bgrmystr2,"I don't care if we don't see it, as long as he has one"
18-04-2018T00:41:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Indoor beach: the only beach you don’t have to worry about sand getting everywhere
18-04-2018T00:41:39,Bgrmystr2,sand still gets everywhere.
18-04-2018T00:41:42,Vatruvius,Maybe a nice calm fire on a beach with some characters around it...maybe blacked out shadow characters...with a thunder storm looming in...maybe a flying leaf or something?
18-04-2018T00:41:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Or is it a literal indoor beach
18-04-2018T00:41:46,unsteddyphoenix,Would make a sweet sidecomic lol
18-04-2018T00:42:00,unsteddyphoenix,"""Im bored~"" ""Well, there's always the beach room."""
18-04-2018T00:42:08,Twokinds,"Trace's beach has sand, but it's smooth and gentle and soothing, and it stays put."
18-04-2018T00:42:19,unsteddyphoenix,Thats the opposite of normal sand!
18-04-2018T00:42:20,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s not physics
18-04-2018T00:42:25,Vatruvius,Trace has created the best beach.
18-04-2018T00:42:33,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
18-04-2018T00:42:35,SpazztasticKiwi,Magic sand
18-04-2018T00:42:45,Vatruvius,It is a magic beach Kiwi...anything is possible...Tom physics.
18-04-2018T00:42:49,Bgrmystr2,This beach episode is getting better and better
18-04-2018T00:43:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Sounds like that kinetic sand that was all over tv for the longest time
18-04-2018T00:43:21,SpazztasticKiwi,You can have a snowball like fight with that stuff
18-04-2018T00:43:34,Twokinds,"I know you guys think I'm joking but I really do want just one day where all the characters can relax, since they're all in the same place for once."
18-04-2018T00:44:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t think you’re joking. It’s got a lot of potential for character information
18-04-2018T00:44:08,Twokinds,And then things can blow up
18-04-2018T00:44:18,Bgrmystr2,"Like I said tom, I want it to be true"
18-04-2018T00:44:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe someone in the group doesn’t know how to swim or something
18-04-2018T00:44:28,Bgrmystr2,Beach room me!
18-04-2018T00:44:29,unsteddyphoenix,"That does sound nice, im all about character interaction."
18-04-2018T00:45:12,Bgrmystr2,I can only imagine like.. someone disliking the beach
18-04-2018T00:45:17,Bgrmystr2,Unbeach me human! etc
18-04-2018T00:45:24,unsteddyphoenix,lol
18-04-2018T00:45:33,Vatruvius,Maybe do the Trace Estate with a looming storm in the back ground? If everyone is at the Estate doing different things together...then that would tie the whole chapter together really well. Maybe not a thunder storm...a magic storm or something?
18-04-2018T00:45:43,Bgrmystr2,salt water.. gets in the fur.. so hard to brush..
18-04-2018T00:46:28,unsteddyphoenix,But what about the shower scene!
18-04-2018T00:46:35,Bgrmystr2,need one of those too!
18-04-2018T00:46:46,Bgrmystr2,every beach episode has a shower scene
18-04-2018T00:46:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Y’all need to get out more
18-04-2018T00:46:58,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
18-04-2018T00:47:06,Bgrmystr2,pity it's not a hot springs episode.. but we already had that so I'm pretty happy so far.
18-04-2018T00:47:09,Bgrmystr2,:V
18-04-2018T00:47:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Beach scenes can get just as steamy
18-04-2018T00:47:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t draw attention to it
18-04-2018T00:47:43,unsteddyphoenix,"So you want the chapter cover to be like, all happy 'n' stuff? Or is there like, supposed to be some tension while it's happening."
18-04-2018T00:47:45,Vatruvius,Trace probably has an indoor hot spring if I am being honest.
18-04-2018T00:48:03,Twokinds,Trace's magic beach is freshwater
18-04-2018T00:48:05,unsteddyphoenix,A sauna you mean
18-04-2018T00:48:05,SpazztasticKiwi,I haven’t been to a beach in awhile. And I’m probably too pale for one anyway
18-04-2018T00:48:15,unsteddyphoenix,I really want to go to Traces magic beach tbh
18-04-2018T00:48:19,Twokinds,"It's his shower room, it's just enchanted to look like a beach."
18-04-2018T00:48:24,unsteddyphoenix,Can you get sunburned at his beach?
18-04-2018T00:48:25,Bgrmystr2,oh shit
18-04-2018T00:48:27,unsteddyphoenix,Oh shit.
18-04-2018T00:48:27,Bgrmystr2,awesome
18-04-2018T00:48:37,BadFoMo,More lore!
18-04-2018T00:48:42,unsteddyphoenix,Absolute canon
18-04-2018T00:48:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"Now I want to go. Magic sand, magic beach"
18-04-2018T00:48:50,Bgrmystr2,shutup fomo you'll ruin it
18-04-2018T00:48:55,SpazztasticKiwi,Sign me up
18-04-2018T00:49:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"For a self-proclaimed hermit, you have an eye for atmosphere"
18-04-2018T00:50:02,Bgrmystr2,atmosphere is something you can learn from home
18-04-2018T00:50:03,Twokinds,"putting the estate on the cover seems like a good idea, but at the same time"
18-04-2018T00:50:06,unsteddyphoenix,"Ofc. If the world was like that, we'd prolly go outside"
18-04-2018T00:50:08,Twokinds,I really don't want to draw the estate again
18-04-2018T00:50:17,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, that would be a good idea, tom"
18-04-2018T00:50:23,Bgrmystr2,but that'd be a lot of work
18-04-2018T00:50:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Why’d you make it so complicated then
18-04-2018T00:50:32,unsteddyphoenix,'cause it's cooler that way
18-04-2018T00:50:32,Bgrmystr2,because estates have to be awesome
18-04-2018T00:50:41,Twokinds,WELL I CAN'T EXACTLY HAVE A MANSION NOT LOOK FANCY
18-04-2018T00:50:45,Bgrmystr2,"Rule of Cool, Kiwi."
18-04-2018T00:50:46,Bgrmystr2,See?
18-04-2018T00:50:46,Vatruvius,I figured...could you do like part of the estate...like a balcony or a living room with a window to the outside or something?
18-04-2018T00:50:49,BadFoMo,Draw the two groups at the table?
18-04-2018T00:50:53,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe a beach day selfie with all the characters
18-04-2018T00:50:56,SpazztasticKiwi,?
18-04-2018T00:51:00,unsteddyphoenix,All the rich kids are into cube buildings~
18-04-2018T00:51:04,Twokinds,"CAN you imagine. ""Look, there it is! Trace's estate!"" [it's a box]"
18-04-2018T00:51:16,unsteddyphoenix,Just explain it as post-modernism
18-04-2018T00:51:17,Vatruvius,lol
18-04-2018T00:51:23,SpazztasticKiwi,But it’s what’s inside that counts
18-04-2018T00:51:24,BadFoMo,"""It's only a modle,"""
18-04-2018T00:51:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Duh
18-04-2018T00:51:27,Vatruvius,No...too far unsteddy.
18-04-2018T00:51:27,unsteddyphoenix,Lmao
18-04-2018T00:51:27,BadFoMo,*&gt;
18-04-2018T00:51:34,BadFoMo,*.
18-04-2018T00:51:34,Bgrmystr2,XD Box
18-04-2018T00:51:38,Bgrmystr2,perfect
18-04-2018T00:51:43,unsteddyphoenix,Inside is...smaller boxes
18-04-2018T00:51:49,Bgrmystr2,omfg yes
18-04-2018T00:52:06,Bgrmystr2,It's a box house made of a lot of boxes
18-04-2018T00:52:09,Bgrmystr2,like that show on tv
18-04-2018T00:52:13,Bgrmystr2,"fuck, what was the name of it"
18-04-2018T00:52:16,Vatruvius,Maybe...maybe like Trace looking over the group from an inside balcony as the hang near a fire place or something?
18-04-2018T00:52:34,BadFoMo,A box fort?
18-04-2018T00:52:40,Vatruvius,"they* not ""the"""
18-04-2018T00:53:13,unsteddyphoenix,I feel like that'd have some weird implications. Trace looking over everyone else.
18-04-2018T00:53:40,Bgrmystr2,the show Out Of The Box
18-04-2018T00:53:44,SpazztasticKiwi,"With what he’s been through, Trace could use a nap on the beach"
18-04-2018T00:53:48,Twokinds,"Trace, smiling in the shadows"
18-04-2018T00:53:53,Bgrmystr2,watched it a few times when I was little
18-04-2018T00:53:55,Vatruvius,Just spewing ideas is all...maybe a view is from the balcony and everyone is hanging together...I don't know.
18-04-2018T00:53:59,unsteddyphoenix,Haha
18-04-2018T00:54:28,unsteddyphoenix,"He's like, completely sinister position and lighting, big innocent goofy smile"
18-04-2018T00:54:32,unsteddyphoenix,perfect
18-04-2018T00:54:42,Vatruvius,He and Shadow Trace have become one.
18-04-2018T00:54:47,Vatruvius,:ptv-shock:
18-04-2018T00:56:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I could see a beach photo. Karen running rampant with a camera
18-04-2018T00:56:34,unsteddyphoenix,I think cameras arent invented. Maybe.
18-04-2018T00:56:48,unsteddyphoenix,Eric running rampant with a paintbrush lol.
18-04-2018T00:56:48,Vatruvius,All the characters resting of the beach...Nibbly running away with everyone clothes.
18-04-2018T00:57:02,Bgrmystr2,"""Neat"" :camera_with_flash:"
18-04-2018T00:57:04,BadFoMo,@unsteddyphoenix Smiling like this? https://youtu.be/JvdAFTM6nEY?t=25s
18-04-2018T00:57:06,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
18-04-2018T00:57:08,SpazztasticKiwi,“Come back here dammit my eyes were closed!”
18-04-2018T00:57:18,unsteddyphoenix,Jesus no
18-04-2018T00:57:38,SpazztasticKiwi,I could see Nibs stealing clothes
18-04-2018T00:57:41,Bgrmystr2,Hahahahaha
18-04-2018T00:57:47,Bgrmystr2,that's creepy as fuck
18-04-2018T00:58:30,unsteddyphoenix,"Take a cute patreon art, re-purpose it for a chapter cover"
18-04-2018T00:58:33,unsteddyphoenix,Easy peasy
18-04-2018T00:58:57,SpazztasticKiwi,It’d have to be a real impressive suggestion
18-04-2018T00:59:42,unsteddyphoenix,Just some characters interacting in a cute way~
18-04-2018T00:59:56,unsteddyphoenix,Wordlessly ofc
18-04-2018T01:00:16,BadFoMo,What about everyone in the Living Room watching the Magical Widescreen?
18-04-2018T01:00:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Like “Paranoia”?
18-04-2018T01:00:25,Twokinds,yeah no
18-04-2018T01:00:51,unsteddyphoenix,"But, the efficiency!"
18-04-2018T01:00:58,BadFoMo,@SpazztasticKiwi OH! Pick one of mine!
18-04-2018T01:01:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Wat
18-04-2018T01:01:40,Vatruvius,lol
18-04-2018T01:01:46,unsteddyphoenix,"Well, the chapter cover could just be some cute interaction, right? Since that's what'll be in the chapter..."
18-04-2018T01:01:51,Vatruvius,You said it would have to be an impressive suggestion Kiwi.
18-04-2018T01:01:53,unsteddyphoenix,Dont actually take it from patreon but
18-04-2018T01:03:05,unsteddyphoenix,"Maddie hugging nibbly in the foreground, characters talking in the background"
18-04-2018T01:03:35,unsteddyphoenix,Something sweet like that.
18-04-2018T01:03:41,Vatruvius,Get anything from these suggestions Tom?
18-04-2018T01:04:13,BadFoMo,Are the chaptor titles already picked out?
18-04-2018T01:04:23,unsteddyphoenix,If youre really stuck sleeping on it might help.
18-04-2018T01:04:53,BadFoMo,@unsteddyphoenix What they said.
18-04-2018T01:05:29,Twokinds,Doesn't help I've already taken my sleeping tablet
18-04-2018T01:05:51,SpazztasticKiwi,You take meds to sleep?
18-04-2018T01:05:52,unsteddyphoenix,"Ah,"
18-04-2018T01:05:58,unsteddyphoenix,Might have to surrender the evening lol
18-04-2018T01:06:10,Twokinds,just melatonin
18-04-2018T01:06:20,SpazztasticKiwi,It is 2 in the morning for you
18-04-2018T01:06:37,Vatruvius,Our suggestions are not helping your the melatonin shutting your brain down?
18-04-2018T01:06:38,Twokinds,"Yeah I know, it's pretty early, but I'm trying to get to bed earlier."
18-04-2018T01:06:46,Vatruvius,lol
18-04-2018T01:06:49,unsteddyphoenix,Thats a good goal~
18-04-2018T01:06:55,Vatruvius,"""Early"" he says."
18-04-2018T01:07:08,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s usually melatonin. Unless it’s an outright seditive
18-04-2018T01:07:20,Twokinds,lol that's what Sage says to me
18-04-2018T01:07:37,Twokinds,"Literally, the other day I told him I was going to bed and he said ""it's not even 4 yet"""
18-04-2018T01:07:46,Twokinds,Cause he's always going to bed around 7 - 8
18-04-2018T01:07:47,Vatruvius,lol
18-04-2018T01:07:58,Dadrobit,Back.
18-04-2018T01:07:59,unsteddyphoenix,Ideal tbh
18-04-2018T01:08:03,BadFoMo,Yo.
18-04-2018T01:08:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Last night I didn’t get in bed till 4 because I was lollygagging on my phone
18-04-2018T01:08:39,Dadrobit,"You said ""sleeping tablet"" and for a bit there I was like, ""He has a tablet for drawing his comic, but there's another that he takes to bed with him?"""
18-04-2018T01:08:53,SpazztasticKiwi,That was one of my first thoughts too
18-04-2018T01:08:54,unsteddyphoenix,"For sleep-drawing, of course."
18-04-2018T01:09:04,Vatruvius,I have not stayed up past 1:30 in a long time...and that is rare. I mostly go to bed at 12:00 or 12:30.
18-04-2018T01:09:35,Bgrmystr2,lol dadro that was my first thought too
18-04-2018T01:09:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"For a quick minute, I imagined someone getting cracked over the head with a drawing tablet"
18-04-2018T01:10:01,SpazztasticKiwi,“NIGHT NIGHT”
18-04-2018T01:10:42,Dadrobit,Adobe Sleeper
18-04-2018T01:11:35,unsteddyphoenix,"Could see it, give it a couple years"
18-04-2018T01:11:53,Twokinds,ok
18-04-2018T01:12:05,Twokinds,What kind of interactions are you guys hoping to see
18-04-2018T01:12:16,Twokinds,now that everyone is in one place
18-04-2018T01:12:27,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: hmm
18-04-2018T01:12:41,Bgrmystr2,I know I wanna see Raine and Rose
18-04-2018T01:12:47,Vatruvius,I was kinda thinking...though the groups are all together...they would still kinda be split up.
18-04-2018T01:13:05,Dadrobit,"Shit, it I really need to get around to finishing writing that side story prompt. This would be the place for it."
18-04-2018T01:13:26,Vatruvius,Like...the two main groups may mingle and introduce/talk but like the secondary characters might do something else.
18-04-2018T01:13:47,Vatruvius,Like...Mike and Evals and maybe some others are doing their own thing like the others.
18-04-2018T01:13:53,Vatruvius,Split off groups basically.
18-04-2018T01:14:01,Vatruvius,Or am I in the minority?
18-04-2018T01:14:42,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno, I think everyone traveling to one spot is a great place where everyone has fun, but then they all go their separate ways cuz of reasons"
18-04-2018T01:15:00,Bgrmystr2,"A lot of team B was going to Lyn'knoll, right? Tis where Trace and Flora are going too"
18-04-2018T01:15:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"They’ve never interacted before really, so there’s nothing to base a conversation off of"
18-04-2018T01:15:17,Bgrmystr2,"but Keith wants to take care of Laura's ashes, and Natani will prolly go with him"
18-04-2018T01:15:44,BadFoMo,@Twokinds Would Maddie and Karen be BFFs or Moral Enemies?
18-04-2018T01:15:45,Bgrmystr2,so I'm kinda curious as to who's goin where and what's gonna happen
18-04-2018T01:15:53,BadFoMo,*Mortal
18-04-2018T01:16:02,Bgrmystr2,"lol, Moral Enemies."
18-04-2018T01:16:13,unsteddyphoenix,"If we're just throwing random whims out, more on Zen and his residual feelings for Keith would be fun"
18-04-2018T01:16:27,Bgrmystr2,that'd be great too
18-04-2018T01:16:53,Vatruvius,"Like...a real face to face this time instead of through Natani with a ""cute"" miss speak?"
18-04-2018T01:16:59,unsteddyphoenix,I feel like Kat and Raine could become fast friends too
18-04-2018T01:17:05,Bgrmystr2,Kat's gonna be a newcomer to Team B yeah? They haven't met her yet
18-04-2018T01:17:36,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, nor anyone else who stayed behind"
18-04-2018T01:17:47,unsteddyphoenix,Also never let Maddie and Karen meet
18-04-2018T01:17:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t believe we’ve seen the girls just have a day together
18-04-2018T01:17:52,Bgrmystr2,and Eric's there too.. how many here bet he's gonna want to paint Raine if she's in Keidran form
18-04-2018T01:17:54,unsteddyphoenix,Disastrous
18-04-2018T01:18:09,Bgrmystr2,"I wanna see that so much, phoenix haha"
18-04-2018T01:18:13,Vatruvius,A lot of characters have not really met each other...it would be interesting to see how the groups interact and split apart into different subgroups based on liking a character or trying to get to know each other better.
18-04-2018T01:18:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Kat just starts designing all the ladies swimsuits or something
18-04-2018T01:18:53,Vatruvius,Good think Ranie is currently Human...beside...since she is so modest that is definitely not happening.
18-04-2018T01:19:02,Vatruvius,Red to the rescue!
18-04-2018T01:19:06,Bgrmystr2,there's so much potential in the character meetups.. I just don't know how much time will be there
18-04-2018T01:19:18,unsteddyphoenix,Sythe and Trace mini awkward moment maybe?
18-04-2018T01:19:24,Bgrmystr2,haha
18-04-2018T01:19:25,Bgrmystr2,right
18-04-2018T01:19:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Has Kat really had access to girl talk options? She’s been surrounded by guys primarily right
18-04-2018T01:19:58,Bgrmystr2,"Natani, a bit.. but"
18-04-2018T01:20:07,unsteddyphoenix,"Yeah, pretty much. Flora avoided her 'cause shes s MEENIE and Nat is totes a dude."
18-04-2018T01:20:29,Bgrmystr2,lol Flora and Kat need to stop pulling each other's hair out srsly
18-04-2018T01:20:32,Vatruvius,Basically...all the characters are going to split up and catch up with each other. It will be very interesting to see what happens. I really want a small section to be Mike and Evals doing something on their own or whatever because they don't want to be
18-04-2018T01:20:34,Vatruvius,near the groups.
18-04-2018T01:20:42,Vatruvius,Maybe a side comic...but it would be cool.
18-04-2018T01:20:42,unsteddyphoenix,"Everyones sorta got someone to confide in except Kat, poor thing."
18-04-2018T01:20:54,Bgrmystr2,Kat kinda confided in Natani tho
18-04-2018T01:20:58,Bgrmystr2,"a little, at least"
18-04-2018T01:21:06,BadFoMo,@unsteddyphoenix What if Maddie and Karen talked through Maeve?
18-04-2018T01:21:10,unsteddyphoenix,"Thats true, but Nats taken~"
18-04-2018T01:21:22,Bgrmystr2,"Maeve isn't gonna be at the manor though, Fomo"
18-04-2018T01:21:35,BadFoMo,...And slowly started crupting her?
18-04-2018T01:21:39,Bgrmystr2,"shouldn't be.. anyway, not sure"
18-04-2018T01:21:54,Bgrmystr2,"I don't actually know where everyone from the town is evacuating to, or whatnot"
18-04-2018T01:22:04,BadFoMo,"@Bgrmystr2 Yeah, there's that."
18-04-2018T01:23:14,Vatruvius,Tom is just furiously righting ideas down that we sparked in his head...but since he took melatonine it is very slow and slowing.
18-04-2018T01:23:18,Vatruvius,:ptv-hearts:
18-04-2018T01:23:33,unsteddyphoenix,"Psh, optimistic."
18-04-2018T01:23:46,SpazztasticKiwi,He could also just randomly fall asleep at the computer and we’d never know
18-04-2018T01:23:49,unsteddyphoenix,If we had 100 ideas he might take a couple~
18-04-2018T01:24:05,Bgrmystr2,gonna agree w/ phoenix on this one
18-04-2018T01:24:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Though it seems that blanket is a requirement for true Tom sleep
18-04-2018T01:24:09,Vatruvius,I don't think Tom is actually writing anything down but...funny thought.
18-04-2018T01:24:37,SpazztasticKiwi,I can provide feminine input
18-04-2018T01:24:48,SpazztasticKiwi,But that’s probably about it
18-04-2018T01:25:07,Vatruvius,Provide away...there really is only male input here.
18-04-2018T01:25:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"Problem is, I know human lady behavior, not Keidran or Basitin"
18-04-2018T01:25:58,unsteddyphoenix,Dont assume my input! :ctwokinds-nataniAAAAshake:
18-04-2018T01:26:37,Twokinds,"Well the only Basitin lady is Maddie, and she's not particularly feminine"
18-04-2018T01:26:40,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh:
18-04-2018T01:26:53,unsteddyphoenix,"No, Lynn is also there /s"
18-04-2018T01:26:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Neither am I if you wanna get right down to it
18-04-2018T01:27:02,Vatruvius,Did I get that wrong unsteddy?
18-04-2018T01:28:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"You also have to factor in the world they live in to calculate how they’d act. Yeah, a lot is already known and understood because story, but"
18-04-2018T01:29:14,SpazztasticKiwi,I can only advise based on understanding
18-04-2018T01:29:42,Vatruvius,I think that is what we all try to do. Unless anyone here identifies as Basitin or Keidran?
18-04-2018T01:30:28,SpazztasticKiwi,"With Nat, I’m not sure I’d be able to provide a lot because of her situation. I’m most likely able to figure what Flora and maybe Kat would do"
18-04-2018T01:31:19,Vatruvius,"You would be able to cover the feminine side of Nat, liking Keith and all, but other than that she really does act more like a guy."
18-04-2018T01:31:55,SpazztasticKiwi,That “do you wanna touch em” scene? Yes. Accurate
18-04-2018T01:32:21,Vatruvius,lol
18-04-2018T01:32:38,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah I'd do that
18-04-2018T01:32:56,SpazztasticKiwi,"If she’s asking the question, you’re pretty much cleared to say yes as long as you don’t go overboard"
18-04-2018T01:33:35,Vatruvius,"I am pretty sure the ""it is no big deal, I would hope you do the same if your were a girl"" was an excuse/cover."
18-04-2018T01:34:05,SpazztasticKiwi,“Sometimes I squeeze my own boobs. Because I can.”
18-04-2018T01:34:08,Vatruvius,Yeah...if I had a tail in real life it would be a Keith Katana tail in that moment.
18-04-2018T01:34:14,Vatruvius,lol
18-04-2018T01:35:01,Bgrmystr2,xD
18-04-2018T01:35:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"One thing notable is if you ask, and have been a decent human being, you have a good chance with the girl"
18-04-2018T01:36:02,unsteddyphoenix,Also be good loking
18-04-2018T01:36:05,Bgrmystr2,In all fairness.. Keith didn't say no..
18-04-2018T01:36:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Things like “would you like to go for coffee or a movie”
18-04-2018T01:36:14,Vatruvius,shuffles through many draws looking for a notepad and pencil to take notes.
18-04-2018T01:36:57,SpazztasticKiwi,taps blackboard to get students’ attention
18-04-2018T01:37:38,Vatruvius,raises hand to ask for a pencil...he forgot one.
18-04-2018T01:38:24,SpazztasticKiwi,"Even asking “can I kiss you” might be surprising, but it’s sweet to ask"
18-04-2018T01:38:41,SpazztasticKiwi,And use a pen if there’s no pencil
18-04-2018T01:39:15,Bgrmystr2,pens are terrible
18-04-2018T01:39:20,Bgrmystr2,they don't erase if you fuck up
18-04-2018T01:39:27,Vatruvius,"has no pen but found an old marker. ""This will have to do...*starts writing furiously to catch up*"""
18-04-2018T01:39:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Primary thing to remember is not to be a dick
18-04-2018T01:39:43,unsteddyphoenix,Damnit
18-04-2018T01:40:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"Cause if she likes a guy that’s a jerk, you need to run. Run far and run fast"
18-04-2018T01:41:02,unsteddyphoenix,But I'm a jerk so?
18-04-2018T01:41:17,Vatruvius,"Yeah...I am what you would call and ""innocent"" individual if you call it that. Basically one of the nicest and reserved people you would meet. :ptv-hearts:"
18-04-2018T01:41:18,SpazztasticKiwi,And stay away from “the pick up lines”
18-04-2018T01:41:50,Vatruvius,"writes ""pick up lines"" and puts a huge cross in it."
18-04-2018T01:41:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"Cheesy ones might get a laugh, and grab her attention, but some of them will get you slapped"
18-04-2018T01:42:36,Vatruvius,Good thing I am not a pick up line person nor know any.
18-04-2018T01:42:49,Twokinds,Hey baby did you fall from heaven?
18-04-2018T01:43:00,SpazztasticKiwi,No I crawled my way out of hell
18-04-2018T01:43:18,Vatruvius,lol
18-04-2018T01:43:20,SpazztasticKiwi,:ptv-laugh::ptv-tease:
18-04-2018T01:43:38,unsteddyphoenix,Cause it looks like you hit every branch on the way down
18-04-2018T01:43:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"“Hey baby, what’s your sign?”"
18-04-2018T01:44:02,BadFoMo,"""Neon."""
18-04-2018T01:44:04,SpazztasticKiwi,“Dead end. Do not enter”
18-04-2018T01:44:49,SpazztasticKiwi,My favorite is when a guy called himself a choking hazard
18-04-2018T01:45:03,Bgrmystr2,xD Phoenix ow
18-04-2018T01:45:05,Vatruvius,Wow...
18-04-2018T01:45:18,SpazztasticKiwi,I just asked him “Isn’t that the warning they put on toys with small parts?”
18-04-2018T01:45:23,Vatruvius,A little too confident I would say...
18-04-2018T01:45:28,Vatruvius,lol
18-04-2018T01:45:31,Vatruvius,Yes!
18-04-2018T01:45:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Didn’t get another peep from him
18-04-2018T01:45:40,BadFoMo,@SpazztasticKiwi Haha!
18-04-2018T01:46:29,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’m nice, but I also have a temper"
18-04-2018T01:46:42,Bgrmystr2,"brutal, kiwi"
18-04-2018T01:47:05,SpazztasticKiwi,But true if you think about it
18-04-2018T01:47:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, is that the best line you got Tom?"
18-04-2018T01:49:46,unsteddyphoenix,Ay girl do you like tapes and CDs...
18-04-2018T01:50:46,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ve gone digital
18-04-2018T01:50:48,Vatruvius,Where is it!
18-04-2018T01:51:29,Vatruvius,https://www.patreon.com/posts/beginners-guide-14144315
18-04-2018T01:51:32,Vatruvius,Found it!
18-04-2018T01:51:43,Vatruvius,I think that is the only one Tom knows.
18-04-2018T01:53:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Well it can work in some cases
18-04-2018T01:55:37,Dadrobit,"“Hey baby, what’s your sign?” ""Speed Humps Ahead"""
18-04-2018T01:55:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Cheesy line =&gt; make her laugh =&gt; get date
18-04-2018T01:55:59,Vatruvius,Since Tom is still here...what is the proper way to refer to Natani. He or she? I know she is physically one but shows both mentally so...I am so confused!
18-04-2018T01:56:46,unsteddyphoenix,Xlim/xler
18-04-2018T01:58:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, remember my last lesson when I mentioned body language"
18-04-2018T01:59:11,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you shift to your other leg and it brings you closer to her, you can use what she does to judge your next move"
18-04-2018T01:59:43,Bgrmystr2,"Natani is still she. The only part of Natani that's ""he"" is technically Zen."
18-04-2018T01:59:47,SpazztasticKiwi,"If she moves away, you might want to back off. Either she doesn’t like to be that close to people or she’s not interested"
18-04-2018T02:00:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"But if she doesn’t move or moves similarly to be closer to you, she’s likely interested or at the least comfortable with you"
18-04-2018T02:01:07,Dadrobit,Or she has BO and is totally embarrassed about it and would totally be into me otherwise.
18-04-2018T02:01:21,Vatruvius,lol
18-04-2018T02:01:21,Dadrobit,Options abound
18-04-2018T02:01:31,SpazztasticKiwi,"You are a killjoy, ya know that"
18-04-2018T02:01:37,Dadrobit,Yes
18-04-2018T02:01:47,Dadrobit,I am acutely aware in fact.
18-04-2018T02:02:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Though I’m not restricted to giving advice. I can also answer questions
18-04-2018T02:04:21,SpazztasticKiwi,"As for going back to the comic, though, I could see the girls gathering to discuss a baby shower for Flora, or baby names or even just a general discussion about her being pregnant"
18-04-2018T02:04:42,Vatruvius,I cannot think of any questions...but I know I will probably be one of the more awkward types so I would have to hope whoever I go out with finds that cute.
18-04-2018T02:05:13,SpazztasticKiwi,Awkward and shy can come off as very advantageous
18-04-2018T02:05:20,Vatruvius,Names would be good...Trace is not good at coming up with names. :D
18-04-2018T02:05:30,Dadrobit,Everyone is awkward. 92% of being an adult is convincing people you're not.
18-04-2018T02:05:37,Bgrmystr2,"Trace has no memory of anything other than a few months, Vatru. No shit. xD"
18-04-2018T02:05:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"Like I said, you can try making her laugh with cheesiness"
18-04-2018T02:05:50,Bgrmystr2,of course he's bad at thinking of names.
18-04-2018T02:07:13,Dadrobit,"Well, he's okay at it, just not at coming up with unique names."
18-04-2018T02:07:13,Vatruvius,I was referring to that one scene on the ship where Trace was just listing off names of people he knows.
18-04-2018T02:08:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Baby name: “Tora”
18-04-2018T02:09:20,Vatruvius,With all the cool names in this comic...if the name Carol comes up I will just be done. It is like a basic name for what is in the comic.
18-04-2018T02:09:41,Dadrobit,Steve
18-04-2018T02:09:43,unsteddyphoenix,Cool names?
18-04-2018T02:09:55,unsteddyphoenix,I guess euchre is a pretty cool nane
18-04-2018T02:11:12,Vatruvius,"I mean...Trace, Flora, Natani, Keith, Alaric, etc., are all uncommon and not heard of/made new so yeah...not generic/common names please!"
18-04-2018T02:11:52,unsteddyphoenix,Uhh...Keith?
18-04-2018T02:12:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Serena
18-04-2018T02:12:53,Vatruvius,That would be a good one.
18-04-2018T02:13:08,unsteddyphoenix,Rory~
18-04-2018T02:13:13,SpazztasticKiwi,For a girl. Could be twins

18-04-2018T02:14:10,unsteddyphoenix,Bout to watch that fully painted vangogh film

18-04-2018T02:47:24,Vatruvius,Well...everyone seems to have gone to bed so good night! :ptv-greetings:

18-04-2018T03:21:35,Bgrmystr2,"also, that final clovis face you did for today's sketch upload is great"
18-04-2018T03:21:57,Bgrmystr2,you can feel the uncomfortable oozing from it

18-04-2018T03:22:10,Bgrmystr2,ah nice then :D
18-04-2018T03:31:47,SpazztasticKiwi,And plans to go to bed have died I see
18-04-2018T03:32:05,Bgrmystr2,no they're probably still in effect.
18-04-2018T03:32:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Inspiration hit you as soon as you lay down?
18-04-2018T03:32:27,Twokinds,Just trying to get it done while I can
18-04-2018T03:32:52,Twokinds,"I've got Maddie / Karen, Zen / Kathrin, Rose / Raine"
18-04-2018T03:33:11,Twokinds,I need more
18-04-2018T03:35:34,Bgrmystr2,"I get the feeling that Sythe / Trace / Flora are gonna have to chat, cuz he's gonna probably question trace about the kid, and flora may get involved, etc"
18-04-2018T03:35:41,Bgrmystr2,would prolly happen
18-04-2018T03:36:05,Bgrmystr2,He didn't get a lot of info from flora before they went to the manor
18-04-2018T03:36:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Red / Eric?
18-04-2018T03:36:58,Bgrmystr2,"I dunno what exactly they would interact with, that'd just be them meeting"
18-04-2018T03:38:37,Bgrmystr2,"Also, do Team B know the truth about that sleeping supression that Zen supposedly made for them, even though it was the antidote"
18-04-2018T03:38:42,Bgrmystr2,I don't recall if that came up
18-04-2018T03:39:43,SpazztasticKiwi,What’s the full list of characters that’s going to be meeting?
18-04-2018T03:39:55,Bgrmystr2,"I mean, I guess things changed when carver sealed them"
18-04-2018T03:40:26,Bgrmystr2,but it's strange to me that they don't seem to have gotten any answers about that from zen yet
18-04-2018T03:40:59,Bgrmystr2,so I'm guessing the whole mind link thing may end up being a pretty important discussion
18-04-2018T03:41:23,Bgrmystr2,"and basically.. all of team B plus all of team A, Kiwi.."
18-04-2018T03:41:53,Bgrmystr2,everyone that went to trace's manor from the basitin islands plus everyone on team B on their way to Lyn'knoll
18-04-2018T03:42:01,Bgrmystr2,"minus Reni, I guess, but she'll be back"
18-04-2018T03:42:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Or we can just discuss it in the morning
18-04-2018T03:42:25,Bgrmystr2,xD
18-04-2018T03:42:34,SpazztasticKiwi,I need to go to bed
18-04-2018T03:43:06,Bgrmystr2,go to bed then :u
18-04-2018T03:43:45,Bgrmystr2,I know that there's gonna be a discussion between Zen and Reni about Clovis
18-04-2018T03:44:15,Bgrmystr2,Reni risked hide and took a beating on that landing getting em to team B
18-04-2018T03:45:05,Bgrmystr2,"Still wanna know why Nibbly is afraid of Reni, if that is who she's really afraid of.."
18-04-2018T03:45:25,Bgrmystr2,"besides, yknow, big dragon thing aaaa scary, etc"
18-04-2018T03:46:22,Bgrmystr2,I wonder if Euchre will make his presence known to anyone other than Rose
18-04-2018T03:48:55,Bgrmystr2,It's hard to think of much else.. a lot of what will probably happen is just everyone who knows everyone catching up
18-04-2018T03:49:23,Bgrmystr2,"Eric, Kat, Mike, and Evals don't really know anyone else beyond team A.. that I know of anyway"
18-04-2018T03:50:20,Bgrmystr2,poor Red gonna be in a mansion filled with non-humans. I do not envy him xD
18-04-2018T03:51:43,Bgrmystr2,":thinking: Tom, you should be sleeping by now if you're not already"
18-04-2018T04:03:05,unsteddyphoenix,Would it be of EVERY character from the teams? S a lot
18-04-2018T04:04:16,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, well, since Eric's crew of 4 don't really have any history with Team B, I'm not expecting too much"
18-04-2018T04:04:58,unsteddyphoenix,Yeah they'd be hard to pair
18-04-2018T04:05:25,Bgrmystr2,"there's a whole lot of history w/ Trace and the girls/Red from B, as well as Flora, Natani, Zen, and sythe"
18-04-2018T04:06:15,Bgrmystr2,there's a large convoluted history behind them
18-04-2018T04:06:46,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe trace/red sythe/flora
18-04-2018T04:06:59,Twokinds,Ok I am done
18-04-2018T04:07:01,Twokinds,Goodnight
18-04-2018T04:07:11,Bgrmystr2,gnight Tom
18-04-2018T04:07:46,unsteddyphoenix,Gnight man
18-04-2018T04:08:17,Bgrmystr2,This chapter is gonna be lore-heavy I can feel it in my gizzard :v
18-04-2018T04:08:21,Bgrmystr2,"if I had one, that is."
18-04-2018T04:10:22,Twokinds,It'll definitely be character heavy
18-04-2018T04:10:27,Twokinds,er I mean zZz
18-04-2018T04:10:37,unsteddyphoenix,21 you mean. 20 sounds like pure character de- yeah
18-04-2018T04:10:37,Bgrmystr2,"good luck with it, tom"
18-04-2018T04:11:28,Bgrmystr2,"well, character development is part of lore, yeh? :thinking: I mean, we're gonna potentially find out stuff about characters that we didn't know"
18-04-2018T04:11:30,unsteddyphoenix,What it will be is writing heavy. So yeah good luck~
18-04-2018T04:11:36,Bgrmystr2,that is true
18-04-2018T04:11:55,Bgrmystr2,21 I'm expecting more action than anything else
18-04-2018T04:13:45,unsteddyphoenix,"When he says ""blow up"" I'm expecting literally"
18-04-2018T04:13:52,Bgrmystr2,same
18-04-2018T04:14:12,Bgrmystr2,Michael Bay or go home
18-04-2018T04:15:25,unsteddyphoenix,Big agree
18-04-2018T07:34:55,DRAGONTANOPUG,Ughh its thursday. ☹
18-04-2018T08:14:10,DRAGONTANOPUG,Whats the last conversation about?
18-04-2018T08:19:32,DRAGONTANOPUG,Ugh school be back in 6 hours.
18-04-2018T13:59:16,MidnightBlue78,:ptv-SteelwormHades:
18-04-2018T14:00:13,MidnightBlue78,hello~
18-04-2018T14:41:44,SpazztasticKiwi,Midnight!
18-04-2018T14:42:08,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m over at my aunt’s. Dad’s dad is visiting from Cali
18-04-2018T14:46:55,Vatruvius,Home at last!:ptv-greetings:
18-04-2018T14:57:42,Bgrmystr2,"ah good, I didn't miss mutch"
18-04-2018T14:58:22,Vatruvius,Yeah...does not seem like much has happened.
18-04-2018T14:58:25,Bgrmystr2,"an hour ago, the site disconnected me"
18-04-2018T14:58:35,Bgrmystr2,gave me a reconnecting loop
18-04-2018T15:00:06,Vatruvius,That never happens to me.
18-04-2018T15:00:18,Vatruvius,But...I also do not keep a tab open and my computer on 24/7
18-04-2018T15:03:00,Bgrmystr2,xD I do that.
18-04-2018T15:03:13,Bgrmystr2,It's probably a limitation of the site connection to clients
18-04-2018T15:03:42,Bgrmystr2,unintentional bug or whatnot
18-04-2018T15:05:35,Vatruvius,Maybe a server reset?
18-04-2018T15:06:37,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, dunno. seems like an arbitrary time to do it"
18-04-2018T15:07:55,Vatruvius,What time does it happen? They could be using servers else where or their base of operations is somewhere else?
18-04-2018T15:08:24,Vatruvius,Perhaps if it is a server reset that time just happens to be their average least traffic?
18-04-2018T15:08:47,Bgrmystr2,I don't actually know when it happens. It's impossible for us to tell cuz server resets don't actually mess with the chat. They'd likely just transfer the chat to a different server
18-04-2018T15:09:12,Bgrmystr2,"if they needed to shut it down, that is"
18-04-2018T15:09:20,Vatruvius,Makes sense.
18-04-2018T15:09:25,Bgrmystr2,server resets are like.. no different than hotfixes
18-04-2018T15:09:35,Bgrmystr2,updates that go up in the background
18-04-2018T15:09:57,Bgrmystr2,but don't affect the live servers until they ask the server for any updates
18-04-2018T15:10:10,Bgrmystr2,tis how a lot of game companies do their games too
18-04-2018T15:10:25,Vatruvius,Maybe it has to do with the fact that you have a window up all the time...I never have this issue but I never have a tab open even for just the daylight part of the day.
18-04-2018T15:11:20,Bgrmystr2,"game is live, and they don't need to shut down the game for a hotfix cuz the server they update is not actually part of the game server"
18-04-2018T15:11:42,Vatruvius,Yeah...that makes sense.
18-04-2018T15:11:45,Bgrmystr2,kinda like editing files of a program while it's running in the background..
18-04-2018T15:11:55,Bgrmystr2,as long as you're not messing with files the program is using actively
18-04-2018T15:12:10,Bgrmystr2,"then when you update that file, the program will use the new file cuz you updated it"
18-04-2018T15:12:57,Bgrmystr2,Picarto likely does that on a large scale for all the chat servers to keep the cache cleared and updated every so often
18-04-2018T15:13:56,Bgrmystr2,"Also, it probably has nothing to do with whether the window is up all the time. Lots of people have the reconnecting loop"
18-04-2018T15:14:01,Bgrmystr2,and not all of em do like I do
18-04-2018T15:14:05,Vatruvius,Seems logical...almost as if a computer does it! :thinking:
18-04-2018T15:14:16,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
18-04-2018T15:16:32,Bgrmystr2,still think it's a picarto bug that my chat timestamps are not synced to my computer clock.
18-04-2018T15:16:49,Bgrmystr2,I got an email back saying it's supposedly set to follow the clock of the client
18-04-2018T15:17:05,Bgrmystr2,but clearly it's not if picarto says 20:17 and my computer says 3:17
18-04-2018T15:17:11,Bgrmystr2,that's not how time works.
18-04-2018T15:17:15,Bgrmystr2,not even remotely
18-04-2018T15:17:21,Vatruvius,I can confirm it is client side because all of my timestamps are my local time.
18-04-2018T15:17:33,Bgrmystr2,yeah for you
18-04-2018T15:17:54,Vatruvius,But it appears it is client side for most users.
18-04-2018T15:17:54,Bgrmystr2,"it's probably a bug that affects certain clients, depending on OS or whatnot"
18-04-2018T15:18:03,Vatruvius,Probably.
18-04-2018T15:18:19,Bgrmystr2,"it's probably entirely client-sided, but there's a bug that prevents it from calculating correctly for some systems"
18-04-2018T15:18:21,Bgrmystr2,like mine &gt;.&gt;
18-04-2018T15:18:28,Bgrmystr2,my laptop is also incorrect
18-04-2018T15:18:35,Vatruvius,What is your system?
18-04-2018T15:18:43,Bgrmystr2,running windows 7 64bit
18-04-2018T15:18:48,Bgrmystr2,on a desktop
18-04-2018T15:19:02,Bgrmystr2,laptop is uh.. fuck I dunno
18-04-2018T15:19:06,Bgrmystr2,would have to check
18-04-2018T15:19:31,Bgrmystr2,"probably also 7, but I'll give it a look"
18-04-2018T15:19:54,Bgrmystr2,yeah win 7
18-04-2018T15:20:27,Vatruvius,7 is getting outdated now...though it should still work unless windows 7 is just really bad with Picarto compared to newer versions.
18-04-2018T15:20:33,Vatruvius,releases*
18-04-2018T15:20:56,Bgrmystr2,"the only thing that's outdated about 7 is it's lack of updates. If it were getting updates, it wouldn't be ""outdated"""
18-04-2018T15:21:00,Bgrmystr2,Updates do not a system make
18-04-2018T15:21:39,Bgrmystr2,There is almost nothing that 8 or 10 can do that windows 7 cannot do
18-04-2018T15:21:49,Vatruvius,Well...it is just dated software is all...everything is moving to 8 and 10. At least on the windows side.
18-04-2018T15:22:14,Bgrmystr2,8 and 10 are trash
18-04-2018T15:22:18,Bgrmystr2,I won't be touching them
18-04-2018T15:22:24,Vatruvius,Possible...though 8 and 10 are probably better optimized for today's software and applications.
18-04-2018T15:22:35,Vatruvius,How would you know they are trash?
18-04-2018T15:22:39,Bgrmystr2,"I want my desktop to be a desktop, not a halfass smartphone wannabe"
18-04-2018T15:22:43,Bgrmystr2,I've seen them and used them.
18-04-2018T15:22:48,Bgrmystr2,and they're garbage
18-04-2018T15:23:21,Bgrmystr2,"I'll keep the last OS that was made for power users, not dumbed down for people who want a shitty smartphone UI for everything"
18-04-2018T15:23:34,Vatruvius,It is all subjective...I will admit 8 was going for the full on phone app but 10 works like a desktop but offers the app system if you want to use it...for the most part I don't.
18-04-2018T15:24:10,Bgrmystr2,"definitely not subjective, it was literally made with that UI mind. They moved away from the file system 7 had on purpose with 8 and 10"
18-04-2018T15:24:17,Bgrmystr2,UI in mind*
18-04-2018T15:24:25,Vatruvius,The UI and interaction was dumbed down...but it still operates like any windows os.
18-04-2018T15:24:49,Bgrmystr2,So would any other computer
18-04-2018T15:24:52,Bgrmystr2,it's just a computer
18-04-2018T15:24:54,Bgrmystr2,the UI matters lol
18-04-2018T15:25:27,Bgrmystr2,but this is probably why I'm gonna be running 7 in a VM when I upgrade my system to something not windows
18-04-2018T15:25:36,Vatruvius,But...I literally disable all the phone app stuff so it is just another windows operator/desktop that runs just like the old ones do...with updates.
18-04-2018T15:26:41,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah surprisingly, I've never seen most updates do anything remotely useful for home computers for the most part"
18-04-2018T15:26:58,Bgrmystr2,"but I guess power users know what they're doin, don't really need all the extra security"
18-04-2018T15:27:07,Bgrmystr2,just in case someone does somethin stupid on it
18-04-2018T15:27:24,Bgrmystr2,90% of it is just taking up space
18-04-2018T15:27:59,Bgrmystr2,"""X update fixed a bug"" Yeh, and it caused 3 more"
18-04-2018T15:28:02,Vatruvius,Probably...I am not a power user for windows...it is just an OS I have used since my first computer but I would think the updates do contain added functionality for new technology...maybe underlying but there.
18-04-2018T15:28:17,Bgrmystr2,most windows updates do not
18-04-2018T15:28:26,Bgrmystr2,they're just security updates and bug fixes
18-04-2018T15:28:46,Bgrmystr2,"they ""fix back doors"" even though there's plenty of ones that they know about that they don't fix"
18-04-2018T15:29:06,Vatruvius,Meh...most operating systems are large though...that is just how they run. At least the main stream ones anyway.
18-04-2018T15:29:12,Bgrmystr2,"there's probably updates for stuff like Direct X and such, but those aren't OS-related"
18-04-2018T15:29:22,Bgrmystr2,"they don't need to be, that's the problem :/"
18-04-2018T15:29:46,Bgrmystr2,the OS only needs to function as a UI for the user to use the system. It doesn't need to function for anything else
18-04-2018T15:30:04,Vatruvius,Yeah...I know Lynix is small because it needs very little space to run on my Pi...or a Pi...mine has not arrived yet.
18-04-2018T15:30:33,Vatruvius,I am curious as to why Windows is so large? What do they do with all that space?
18-04-2018T15:30:41,Bgrmystr2,"Windows just keeps tacking on stuff that noone really needs as part of the OS so even if you don't use it, it's just sitting there taking up space"
18-04-2018T15:30:51,Vatruvius,Not that space is much of a concern these days...got RAM and storage for years.
18-04-2018T15:31:01,Bgrmystr2,you'd be surprised lol
18-04-2018T15:31:14,Bgrmystr2,"back in the 90s, we had HDs like.. 60gb or so"
18-04-2018T15:31:30,Bgrmystr2,"prolly late 90s honestly, I don't actually remember too well"
18-04-2018T15:31:39,Bgrmystr2,but yeah now we've got 6TB drives
18-04-2018T15:31:51,Bgrmystr2,that's crazy
18-04-2018T15:31:52,Vatruvius,I know...my computer science professor brought in a tape real and stuff...60MB...or a floppy disk and KB storage.
18-04-2018T15:32:19,Bgrmystr2,I used floppys for a while
18-04-2018T15:32:31,Bgrmystr2,I hated CDs cuz they were so limited compared to floppys
18-04-2018T15:32:35,Bgrmystr2,"still do, actually"
18-04-2018T15:32:54,Bgrmystr2,"A floppy runs just like a flash drive does, in theory. You can put files on and take files off"
18-04-2018T15:32:59,Bgrmystr2,and do anything you want with it
18-04-2018T15:33:11,Bgrmystr2,"CDs you have to burn the entire cd, not just put stuff on it and take it off"
18-04-2018T15:33:30,Bgrmystr2,"cds are a waste of time, unless you need something permanant like a game, program, show, etc"
18-04-2018T15:33:33,Vatruvius,Maybe that will be something I work on in the future when I get programming experience...make a simple OS that is user friendly and does a good job at what it does...no other shit unless that is necessary.
18-04-2018T15:33:42,Bgrmystr2,they already do that
18-04-2018T15:34:13,Bgrmystr2,"most of the Linux, Unix, and other non-windows OSes are open source barebones OSes"
18-04-2018T15:34:19,Bgrmystr2,far as I'm aware
18-04-2018T15:34:54,Bgrmystr2,"so a lot of em don't have the nice UI functionality that windows does, but they also don't come with the unnecessary stuff that clogs your drive"
18-04-2018T15:35:14,Bgrmystr2,though I'm sure they have ways to get around it
18-04-2018T15:35:18,Vatruvius,They are...but I am thinking of making one main stream competing with Windows type stuff...perhaps in the server space too. I would like to tackle the problem of utilizing cores in a process. That would be fun to work on.
18-04-2018T15:35:42,Bgrmystr2,"gl then, that'd take a team of hundreds of people years to do"
18-04-2018T15:35:43,Bgrmystr2,lol
18-04-2018T15:35:53,Bgrmystr2,"lotta coding, lotta math"
18-04-2018T15:35:58,Bgrmystr2,lotta headaches
18-04-2018T15:36:38,Vatruvius,"Yup...but it should happen in my lifetime...I hope I can lead that project. But I would need money so first I need to create a successful business. Cool, simple OS first then if that is a hit work on that."
18-04-2018T15:37:03,Vatruvius,Or a successful game business that feeds the software/os side of the business...some many paths to take.
18-04-2018T15:42:32,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
18-04-2018T15:47:42,Vatruvius,Be back in a while...see ya Bgr.
18-04-2018T15:47:56,Bgrmystr2,alright
18-04-2018T16:44:16,DRAGONTANOPUG,Back from school!
18-04-2018T17:10:25,BluePhantom90,wb
18-04-2018T17:24:20,Dadrobit,"Howdy y'all. Finished class, on to homework! :D"
18-04-2018T17:25:22,Dadrobit,Then I'll probably head on over to grandma's and check in on her.
18-04-2018T17:26:04,Dadrobit,"She got sent home this morning, but's gonna head in on Tuesday for an operation."
18-04-2018T17:27:02,BadFoMo,May she get well soon.
18-04-2018T17:27:35,Dadrobit,:/ Here's hoping.
18-04-2018T17:28:40,Dadrobit,They're gonna do something with bone cement to relieve some of the pressure on her.
18-04-2018T17:28:54,Dadrobit,Hopefully that gives her some fairly immediate relief.
18-04-2018T17:34:52,Vatruvius,Back! :ptv-greetings: Hey Dadro...best wishes to your grandma.
18-04-2018T17:46:14,DRAGONTANOPUG,Hellp
18-04-2018T17:46:18,DRAGONTANOPUG,Hello
18-04-2018T17:46:48,DRAGONTANOPUG,Isnt breaking your back breaking your spine?
18-04-2018T17:52:33,DRAGONTANOPUG,😒
18-04-2018T17:58:15,Vatruvius,"In this case, no. Just a disk compression."
18-04-2018T17:58:28,DRAGONTANOPUG,Oh
18-04-2018T17:59:21,DRAGONTANOPUG,"I was going to say if breaking a back is breaking a spine, call break your spine instead of breaking your back."
18-04-2018T18:05:33,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Tom, I think the hoodies and the shirts will be gone before next chrristmas. I can only get it when im 18."
18-04-2018T18:08:15,Vatruvius,I am sure there will be more.
18-04-2018T18:19:02,DRAGONTANOPUG,Some one got tattos of trace flora and natani and keith On there legs
18-04-2018T18:19:14,DRAGONTANOPUG,https://goo.gl/images/r1Hnhv
18-04-2018T18:19:17,DRAGONTANOPUG,No joke
18-04-2018T18:21:22,Vatruvius,But why? Like...now everyone who sees the back of your legs will know/wonder who they are.
18-04-2018T18:21:33,Vatruvius,I doubt they will age well either.
18-04-2018T18:21:36,Bgrmystr2,lots of people have Twokinds tattoos
18-04-2018T18:21:49,Bgrmystr2,"why get ANY tattoo then, Vatru? lol"
18-04-2018T18:23:32,DRAGONTANOPUG,Natanis face tho
18-04-2018T18:28:36,Vatruvius,Hmm...just finished the signature print video...the other prints look awesome. I doubt you can get them now though...right?
18-04-2018T18:31:19,DRAGONTANOPUG,No clue
18-04-2018T18:35:53,Bgrmystr2,"you mean the previous prints, before the Raine one that Tom just finished?"
18-04-2018T18:35:59,Vatruvius,Yeah.
18-04-2018T18:36:00,Bgrmystr2,those are sold at the convention
18-04-2018T18:36:06,Vatruvius,Really?
18-04-2018T18:36:09,BluePhantom90,I mean I am a fan but I wouldn't tattoo them onto me
18-04-2018T18:36:28,Vatruvius,I wouldn't get a tattoo period...does not matter of what.
18-04-2018T18:36:32,Bgrmystr2,"no, he sells them at yard sales in the next door neighbor's backyard. :ptv-unimpressed:"
18-04-2018T18:37:01,Vatruvius,No need for sarcasm...I thought they were a limited thing.
18-04-2018T18:37:26,Bgrmystr2,They are. You can't get them anywhere but the convention. :u
18-04-2018T18:37:38,Bgrmystr2,unless you find one on like.. amazon or ebay or somethin
18-04-2018T18:38:11,Vatruvius,However...to get them means I have to go to one of the events which I never have done...I have no friends who would go..and I have no money to go to one of those events. :ptv-sad:
18-04-2018T18:38:24,Bgrmystr2,"also, I like my sarcasm thankyou very much :("
18-04-2018T18:38:44,Vatruvius,I like sarcasm...just not that one. :ptv-hearts:
18-04-2018T18:39:07,Bgrmystr2,cuz it's aimed at you :V
18-04-2018T18:39:09,Bgrmystr2,toobad
18-04-2018T18:39:16,Vatruvius,"My ""Really?"" commit was about the prints being limited...which they are not. Now I know."
18-04-2018T18:39:49,Vatruvius,comment*
18-04-2018T18:39:56,DRAGONTANOPUG,I just destroyed my kd i went 9 kills 28 deaths
18-04-2018T18:40:13,Twokinds,"The prints are limited. Well, the ones for Vol 4 are."
18-04-2018T18:40:44,Twokinds,"But yeah, I also sell them at convention, so it's not exclusive."
18-04-2018T18:40:48,Vatruvius,So...you can buy the older prints at your booth but not the Raine one?
18-04-2018T18:40:58,Vatruvius,Oh...okay.
18-04-2018T18:41:54,Vatruvius,Going to have to add saving up for a convention to get posters and other things to my list of things to save up for.
18-04-2018T18:42:25,Bgrmystr2,You can buy the Raine ones at the booth too. It's just that's really the only place to get them once they're gone from the preorders online
18-04-2018T18:42:37,Bgrmystr2,conventions are kinda difficult for a lot of people to get to
18-04-2018T18:42:49,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Tom, i know ive been a bit annoying and i ask this every week but i wont be able too see another stream for week after tomarrow morning. Will you stream today?"
18-04-2018T18:43:06,Bgrmystr2,There's a stream on Friday :o
18-04-2018T18:43:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Scheduled
18-04-2018T18:43:19,Bgrmystr2,like every single friday
18-04-2018T18:43:32,DRAGONTANOPUG,I can watch it
18-04-2018T18:43:43,DRAGONTANOPUG,Im hoing to my dads after school
18-04-2018T18:44:06,Vatruvius,I would just stick with the banner Dragon...all others are just bonus streams really. You can always watch the recording too or watch the video on Youtube.
18-04-2018T18:44:12,Bgrmystr2,"it's not really tom can do anything about though. He can't schedule himself around you, bro"
18-04-2018T18:44:33,DRAGONTANOPUG,I know i was just asking if he was planning too.
18-04-2018T18:44:58,Bgrmystr2,"If he does, you'll know by hanging out here. :u"
18-04-2018T18:45:00,Vatruvius,My assumption is no stream unless there is one. :ptv-hearts:
18-04-2018T18:45:10,SpazztasticKiwi,I just figured out that my schedule is not going to work for me going to MomoCon
18-04-2018T18:45:25,Bgrmystr2,MomoCon &gt; everything else
18-04-2018T18:45:32,Vatruvius,That is a shame...right? I don't really know.
18-04-2018T18:45:34,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
18-04-2018T18:45:54,Vatruvius,I guess you don't have to worry about your friends not making it though Kiwi.
18-04-2018T18:46:46,SpazztasticKiwi,"Well if my friend gets back to me as able to go, I may still go, but it looks like he may have work"
18-04-2018T18:46:50,Twokinds,Aw
18-04-2018T18:47:12,Vatruvius,When did you find TK Kiwi?
18-04-2018T18:47:17,SpazztasticKiwi,I was hoping to check out the Dream Daddy dev team there
18-04-2018T18:47:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I found TK through Mark. He put the link in one of his videos
18-04-2018T18:47:55,SpazztasticKiwi,It was about a year or so ago
18-04-2018T18:48:57,Vatruvius,I found TK through Mark too. See...he is not entirely useless Tom! :ptv-hearts: Did you manage to go to Tom's both ever Kiwi?
18-04-2018T18:49:10,Vatruvius,booth*
18-04-2018T18:49:20,SpazztasticKiwi,"Never seen him before in real life, no"
18-04-2018T18:49:43,SpazztasticKiwi,Barely know what he looks like
18-04-2018T18:50:17,Vatruvius,I figure Mark clone but with long hair cause that is what his Patreon avatar has.
18-04-2018T18:50:35,SpazztasticKiwi,I just remember the video Mark made “My brother Thomas has this really awesome webcomic you guys should check out”
18-04-2018T18:51:13,Vatruvius,:thinking:...now that I think about it. Since Tom is older I guess Mark is the Tom clone but with short hair?
18-04-2018T18:51:15,Dadrobit,This cat is really terrible for my ability to do homework.
18-04-2018T18:51:19,SpazztasticKiwi,"I was just like “Your what now?” I thought Mark was an only child before that, but no - a sane one was born first"
18-04-2018T18:51:30,Twokinds,You know what else is terrible for homework
18-04-2018T18:51:35,Vatruvius,"lol...""sane"""
18-04-2018T18:51:42,Vatruvius,Yes!
18-04-2018T18:51:46,DRAGONTANOPUG,Yo a stream
18-04-2018T18:51:50,Vatruvius,:ptv-laugh:
18-04-2018T18:51:57,Dadrobit,"If I do homework, I can get a grade in a bit, if I pet the kitty, I can get purrs immediately."
18-04-2018T18:52:12,Dadrobit,"Also, lol."
18-04-2018T18:52:16,SpazztasticKiwi,"From the pictures on the internet, they look similar but not the same. For one, Tom can actually grow facial hair 😆"
18-04-2018T18:52:16,Bgrmystr2,:D Stream

18-04-2018T18:52:49,Dadrobit,I have successfully belly rubbed her eyes into the back of her head.
18-04-2018T18:52:52,Zakuru,"....this is gonna sound like a very weird question, but does anyone know how to calculate wing speed?"
18-04-2018T18:52:52,DRAGONTANOPUG,Ugh please work internet
18-04-2018T18:52:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,......... the left side?
18-04-2018T18:53:03,Bgrmystr2,ayyy This should be great :D!
18-04-2018T18:53:18,Vatruvius,Wing speed?
18-04-2018T18:53:22,Zakuru,bird flight
18-04-2018T18:53:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera was yelling at me when I got home
18-04-2018T18:53:28,Dadrobit,African or European Zak?
18-04-2018T18:53:36,Zakuru,?

18-04-2018T18:53:56,Sammit,Hi Everybody
18-04-2018T18:54:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Isn’t speed force x velocity or something?
18-04-2018T18:54:10,Dadrobit,"It's a Monty Python reference, Zak"
18-04-2018T18:54:24,Ordithus,"Shipping on the left, family on the right"

18-04-2018T18:54:36,Bgrmystr2,and epic on the bottom :V
18-04-2018T18:54:37,Vatruvius,That does not sound right Kiwi.
18-04-2018T18:54:46,Zakuru,but it would be dependent on the wing's surface area as well
18-04-2018T18:54:47,Dadrobit,divided by kiwi.
18-04-2018T18:54:48,MarvTheHugPharaoh,much better :D
18-04-2018T18:54:48,Vatruvius,Velocity = speed.
18-04-2018T18:54:49,Twokinds,fix'd

18-04-2018T18:54:53,CatzArt,This stream came at the perfect time. Nothing like watching Tom draw when your working on art yourself.
18-04-2018T18:55:00,Bgrmystr2,LOL

18-04-2018T18:55:29,Afallingtree,Hey everyone!
18-04-2018T18:55:41,Vatruvius,That is just physics/science...not math. Math is just numbers.
18-04-2018T18:55:50,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Where did that Raine come from? I only saw the page for a second
18-04-2018T18:56:00,Dadrobit,(f/m)=a
18-04-2018T18:56:04,Zakuru,i know the weight and surface area of the wings

18-04-2018T18:56:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"welp, looks like its time to super push Maren and Raine"
18-04-2018T18:56:22,Zakuru,just.... no formulas
18-04-2018T18:56:24,Combak,"So, cover page time?"
18-04-2018T18:56:35,Bgrmystr2,Indeed Combak

18-04-2018T18:56:47,SpazztasticKiwi,I have no idea right off

18-04-2018T18:57:57,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Marv what happened to your pfp lol
18-04-2018T18:57:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Could you try “avian wind speed formula”?
18-04-2018T18:58:03,Bgrmystr2,Maddie vs Karen.. twokinds of shenanigans
18-04-2018T18:58:08,Grishmark,Hello

18-04-2018T18:58:31,Zakuru,i've done a lot of searches

18-04-2018T18:58:45,Vatruvius,The cover for chapter 20 Nillalee
18-04-2018T18:58:46,ItsActuallyKopyKat,;)
18-04-2018T18:58:50,Zakuru,"yes, like if a bird is this size and yadda yadda they could fly about this fast"
18-04-2018T18:59:12,Dadrobit,"You could also use, m/s^2=N/Kg"
18-04-2018T18:59:21,Twokinds,ffs
18-04-2018T18:59:25,Twokinds,I forgot it's trash day
18-04-2018T18:59:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Most birds become little feathered bullets in the air
18-04-2018T18:59:26,Twokinds,brb
18-04-2018T18:59:27,Zakuru,idk what that means
18-04-2018T18:59:32,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"You could ask Alexa, what the airspeed velocity of an unladen sparrow is"
18-04-2018T18:59:35,Bgrmystr2,mkay
18-04-2018T18:59:56,Vatruvius,That is not very specific though because different birds do different things...take an eagle that dives. Though there is a wing speed the wing takes a different shape to achieve that.
18-04-2018T19:00:02,SpazztasticKiwi,You take your trash out at 7 pm?
18-04-2018T19:00:04,Zakuru,Ok! I think i found something
18-04-2018T19:00:07,Ordithus,"I don't know, indicated or true airspeed?"
18-04-2018T19:00:10,Zakuru,hold that tought
18-04-2018T19:00:13,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Why not, Spazz lol"
18-04-2018T19:00:25,Bgrmystr2,8pm kiwi
18-04-2018T19:00:39,FoxxTrotter,@Twokinds I left you a message on Twitter earlier. You can check it out at your convenience. I also posted it on the Forum.
18-04-2018T19:00:40,Bgrmystr2,"probably either to bring it in, or to put it out for tomorrow"
18-04-2018T19:00:41,DRAGONTANOPUG,Im excited for this chapter.
18-04-2018T19:00:42,Vatruvius,I take my trash out the night before so...that is likely what is going on Kiwi.
18-04-2018T19:00:48,ItsActuallyKopyKat,If the trash gets picked up in the morning and you don't want to wake up early...
18-04-2018T19:00:52,SpazztasticKiwi,"Look at us, we won’t do math or much problem solving for ourselves but we’ll jump on someone else’s issues"

18-04-2018T19:01:04,DRAGONTANOPUG,When it finishes after two or three years I'm going to wait until the comic is done
18-04-2018T19:01:05,Ordithus,Tom is well known to be an early riser
18-04-2018T19:01:11,Ordithus,He wakes up at 2!
18-04-2018T19:01:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,lol
18-04-2018T19:01:14,Dadrobit,meters per second squared is equal to the N force divided by the mass.

18-04-2018T19:19:24,Bgrmystr2,"I can't afford it, Thark"
18-04-2018T19:19:36,MviluUatusun,"Of course, my problem with the umlauts is how to pronounce the letter in question."
18-04-2018T19:19:44,MviluUatusun,I think it has something to do with E.
18-04-2018T19:19:49,Vatruvius,"Shame Bgr...shame! Shame, shame, shame, shame!"
18-04-2018T19:19:52,SpazztasticKiwi,My phone refuses to acknowledge foreign names and words
18-04-2018T19:19:53,Bgrmystr2,No shame about it
18-04-2018T19:20:01,Bgrmystr2,Kinda need a house over my head.
18-04-2018T19:20:07,Bgrmystr2,and food to survive
18-04-2018T19:20:24,Vatruvius,All you need is Twokinds Bgr...do not fool yourself. :ptv-hearts:
18-04-2018T19:20:34,FoxxTrotter,There was something on eBay that I noticed earlier in regards to one of TwoKinds books. Insane as hell.
18-04-2018T19:20:39,Bgrmystr2,"yeah ok, a lot of good the books will do me living on the street, Vatru."
18-04-2018T19:20:45,SpazztasticKiwi,Teaching my phone that “Fischbach” was not a typo a journey
18-04-2018T19:20:46,MviluUatusun,"I thought all you needed was love, Vatru.  You dashed all of my childhood memories."
18-04-2018T19:20:48,Bgrmystr2,maybe they'll be good firewood for one night.. :/
18-04-2018T19:20:56,ZRO4825,:x
18-04-2018T19:20:56,unsteddyphoenix,D:
18-04-2018T19:20:59,Vatruvius,They are hard to pronounce Mvilu...I use to when I took German but that was a few years ago. Most of that is gone but counting. I can still do that pretty well.
18-04-2018T19:21:00,SpazztasticKiwi,*was a journey
18-04-2018T19:21:03,Bgrmystr2,Hey Zro :v
18-04-2018T19:21:09,ZRO4825,Ohai thar '.'/

18-04-2018T19:21:30,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-maddiessparkles:Cant' touch this:ctwokinds-karenOOO:
18-04-2018T19:21:51,ZRO4825,Heyyo Tharkis ^_^
18-04-2018T19:22:01,FoxxTrotter,*listens to cats meowing outside*
18-04-2018T19:22:08,SpazztasticKiwi,My German’s...developing. Pretty sure my pronunciation is butchering but I can understand a bit
18-04-2018T19:22:23,ZRO4825,My German is nonexistant!
18-04-2018T19:22:28,unsteddyphoenix,feline orchestra
18-04-2018T19:22:32,MviluUatusun,"I was about to do some writing when I saw that this stream was starting.  I had to decide which I wanted to do more, write or watch this stream.  I guess you know what one I decided to do.  LOL."
18-04-2018T19:22:33,ZRO4825,"Wait, i take that back. I can sing along with Rammstein. :joy:"
18-04-2018T19:22:47,Vatruvius,I am too far out of practice...most words are gone too. I might hope on Doulingo and practice getting back into it.
18-04-2018T19:22:54,Tharkis,spiel mit mir !
18-04-2018T19:22:58,FoxxTrotter,Rammstein is actually supposed to have a new album coming out.
18-04-2018T19:23:01,MviluUatusun,"Actually, ZRO, you do speak a WEE bit of German if you speak English."
18-04-2018T19:23:03,SpazztasticKiwi,They are singing you the song of their people
18-04-2018T19:23:30,ZRO4825,"I speak a bit of German based english, aye. But if you wanna go by THAT, then I also speak a wee bit of spanish, italian, french, and like 10 other languages. :P"
18-04-2018T19:23:56,Vatruvius,German is very much like English...but the gender thing is hard plus you have to get use to the new sentence structure. For the most part the vocabulary got me...just could not learn them.
18-04-2018T19:24:03,MviluUatusun,"I was going to say that, ZRO.  Don't forget Latin.  A goodly portion of English is Latin."
18-04-2018T19:24:03,Dadrobit,:( Still waiting on the next Tool album...
18-04-2018T19:24:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Did you just say “play with me” Thar
18-04-2018T19:24:10,Ordithus,I took 4 years of German.  I can barely say gesundheidt at this point
18-04-2018T19:24:20,Vatruvius,He did Kiwi.
18-04-2018T19:24:42,Vatruvius,Ouch...and that is my favorite Ord.
18-04-2018T19:24:54,ZRO4825,"I can't forget Latin. I took it in High School. That being said, I think about the only thing I remember of it is ""Hello, Teacher."" (""Salve, Magister/Magistra"", for those curious)"
18-04-2018T19:24:55,Vatruvius,Wilkommen!
18-04-2018T19:25:00,Ordithus,13 years of no practice will do that!
18-04-2018T19:25:15,Twokinds,My face hurts from scrunching
18-04-2018T19:25:17,SpazztasticKiwi,My favorite word is kartoffel
18-04-2018T19:25:24,ZRO4825,"I know that feel, Ord. Been a bit over that for me since High School. XD"
18-04-2018T19:25:29,Vatruvius,Scrunching...what are you doing Tom?
18-04-2018T19:25:31,ZRO4825,"Stop scrunching then, Tom! D:"
18-04-2018T19:25:34,MviluUatusun,I actually speak more Japanese than German and I'm of English/Irish ancestry.
18-04-2018T19:25:49,Twokinds,"Whenever I draw a character with an extreme expression, I can't help but mirror it."
18-04-2018T19:25:56,MviluUatusun,And I barely speak Japanese.
18-04-2018T19:26:05,Vatruvius,You are a kartoffel Kiwi! :ptv-hearts:
18-04-2018T19:26:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I use it as a cuss word sometimes
18-04-2018T19:26:28,MviluUatusun,I do know schadenfreude(?).
18-04-2018T19:26:30,Vatruvius,Out of the way! Serious Tom is drawing now!
18-04-2018T19:26:35,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"so if you draw a sleeping character, do you close your eyes, Tom"
18-04-2018T19:26:39,ZRO4825,"lol, I can understand that Tom. Helps to put yourself in the character's shoes a bit. =D"
18-04-2018T19:26:42,Shadowl0rd208,i gtg
18-04-2018T19:26:54,MviluUatusun,"See ya, Shadow."
18-04-2018T19:26:56,MuonNeutrino,karen looking that serious feels weird XD
18-04-2018T19:27:00,MviluUatusun,Bon Soir.
18-04-2018T19:27:09,SpazztasticKiwi,"Extreme expression, huh? How’d you handle that shower sketch then?"
18-04-2018T19:27:14,Twokinds,Yes
18-04-2018T19:27:16,unsteddyphoenix,agreed dad Tool is great
18-04-2018T19:27:24,Vatruvius,lol
18-04-2018T19:27:31,Vatruvius,:ptv-ohmy:
18-04-2018T19:27:32,Bgrmystr2,"There can only be ONE, Muon"
18-04-2018T19:27:38,unsteddyphoenix,"So, when I asked you to draw the angriest Flora possible..."
18-04-2018T19:27:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,hair gets all poofy
18-04-2018T19:28:09,FoxxTrotter,Tool is a band my brother listens to. I never got much into their music.
18-04-2018T19:28:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Maximum foof Flora
18-04-2018T19:28:32,Dadrobit,"I understand that perfection takes time, but man, it's been like 12 years..."
18-04-2018T19:28:33,SpazztasticKiwi,*floof
18-04-2018T19:28:41,SpazztasticKiwi,14
18-04-2018T19:28:43,MviluUatusun,"Oh, BTW, the Patreon sketch today was great, Tom.  I didn't get to see you finish it Sunday."
18-04-2018T19:28:44,BadFoMo,I'm finally here. How long have we been going?
18-04-2018T19:28:49,Twokinds,http://www.awkwardzombie.com/index.php?page=0&comic=072108
18-04-2018T19:28:54,Twokinds,This comic speaks to me.
18-04-2018T19:28:59,Ordithus,Hi FoMo
18-04-2018T19:29:00,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
18-04-2018T19:29:11,MuonNeutrino,XD
18-04-2018T19:29:17,FoxxTrotter,Heh.
18-04-2018T19:29:20,Vatruvius,Woher kommen sie? Sprechen sie Deutsch?
18-04-2018T19:29:22,SpazztasticKiwi,I do that when reading
18-04-2018T19:29:23,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
18-04-2018T19:29:26,unsteddyphoenix,Lolol
18-04-2018T19:29:35,unsteddyphoenix,I remember that comic...
18-04-2018T19:29:46,BluePhantom90,lol
18-04-2018T19:29:52,unsteddyphoenix,oh hey it still updates
18-04-2018T19:29:58,MviluUatusun,"Tom, that comic was hilarious."
18-04-2018T19:30:02,BadFoMo,"Can't look at it right now, but I think I may have seen it."
18-04-2018T19:30:05,DRAGONTANOPUG,Damnit i broke my last xbox controller
18-04-2018T19:30:23,Vatruvius,Why are you breaking them...seriously you get that mad?
18-04-2018T19:30:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Where am I from? Alabama. Do I speak German? Barely
18-04-2018T19:30:35,Dadrobit,"Tool is a masterclass example of amazing mixes. I get that their message can be kinda ""edgy"" to folks, but their actual music is mindblowingly amazing."
18-04-2018T19:30:54,BluePhantom90,SO Wonder if Adira will walk to Traces Mansion
18-04-2018T19:31:13,SpazztasticKiwi,"My translation is slow, and after translating you have to reorder the words to form a sentence"
18-04-2018T19:31:19,unsteddyphoenix,oh yeah theres definitely an edge factor but
18-04-2018T19:31:22,Ordithus,"That's the 3rd floor.  Adira's been living there, RENT FREE"
18-04-2018T19:31:25,SpazztasticKiwi,Or I do anyway
18-04-2018T19:31:28,DRAGONTANOPUG,You dont understand what you go through when your team does crap and you die over and over.
18-04-2018T19:31:29,Vatruvius,"Agh, sie komme aus Alabama. Sie spreche nicht Deutsch."
18-04-2018T19:31:41,Bgrmystr2,That comic page is fuckin great xD
18-04-2018T19:31:45,Dimensional,Tom'
18-04-2018T19:32:00,Dimensional,Tom's doing an AU comic called SdnikOwt!
18-04-2018T19:32:12,MetalAppleSauce,It took me 5 minutes to realise that's maddie and not keith
18-04-2018T19:32:24,MarvTheHugPharaoh,thats racist
18-04-2018T19:32:27,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Wow, out of rage i fixed it."
18-04-2018T19:32:29,Vatruvius,I got that part down Kiwi...done enough German to get somewhat use to eat making translations fast if I know the words.
18-04-2018T19:32:30,MviluUatusun,"Vatru, I'm not sure what you said but, I think you said something about coming to Alabama."
18-04-2018T19:32:34,unsteddyphoenix,Big racialist
18-04-2018T19:32:56,BadFoMo,"So, Maddie and Karen are going to be (at least) rivles."
18-04-2018T19:33:08,BluePhantom90,I take Tom this will be a long Chapter since there will be a lot of randomness everywhere lol
18-04-2018T19:33:30,Ordithus,So many characters in one place
18-04-2018T19:33:31,unsteddyphoenix,youre right except the opposite
18-04-2018T19:33:33,Vatruvius,The chapter is actually suppose to be short Blue. At least compared to the others.
18-04-2018T19:33:37,Kanrod,Hellooooooooooooo
18-04-2018T19:33:40,SpazztasticKiwi,It was more like “She comes/is from Alabama. She speaks no (little?) German”
18-04-2018T19:33:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Kan
18-04-2018T19:33:51,Twokinds,Battling over who gets to keep Maeve
18-04-2018T19:33:59,Vatruvius,It is not perfect...but yeah. :ptv-hearts:
18-04-2018T19:33:59,DRAGONTANOPUG,Lol
18-04-2018T19:34:00,ItsActuallyKopyKat,called it!
18-04-2018T19:34:05,Kanrod,lol can't blam em
18-04-2018T19:34:06,unsteddyphoenix,The most important plot point possible
18-04-2018T19:34:07,DRAGONTANOPUG,My sisters in a nutshell
18-04-2018T19:34:11,Kanrod,*blame em
18-04-2018T19:34:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"welp, Maddie is deadpool so, she wins"
18-04-2018T19:34:12,unsteddyphoenix,Spoiler: adira wins
18-04-2018T19:34:27,MviluUatusun,Adira?  Where?
18-04-2018T19:34:32,SpazztasticKiwi,Lookie there I’m actually learning some German
18-04-2018T19:34:43,Bespin,O/
18-04-2018T19:34:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,HI Bespin
18-04-2018T19:35:01,Bespin,Hows it
18-04-2018T19:35:15,MviluUatusun,Is that Be-spin or Bes-pin?
18-04-2018T19:35:21,Bespin,Bes-pin
18-04-2018T19:35:24,Bespin,lul
18-04-2018T19:35:35,MviluUatusun,Ah.  Star Wars reference.  Cool.
18-04-2018T19:35:46,Bespin,Yes
18-04-2018T19:35:53,Vatruvius,You get better the more you practice correcting each other and stuff. We should try to greet each other in German more often and ask about each others day. Been wanting to practice for a while now anyway. Best opportunity.
18-04-2018T19:36:06,Tharkis,@Twokinds I've got a question for you .  Would it be permissible for me to scan and upload a doodle you did for me in the cover of one of my TK books so i can show some other people?
18-04-2018T19:36:12,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Tom, will there be more natani and keith alone time? 🙃"
18-04-2018T19:36:22,Bespin,hehe
18-04-2018T19:36:23,Zakuru,"alriiiight, im hitting a stump"
18-04-2018T19:36:33,Zakuru,i dont like these answers im getting :upside_down:
18-04-2018T19:36:35,Twokinds,Sure
18-04-2018T19:36:37,Vatruvius,Of course there will be Dragon...what kind of question is that.
18-04-2018T19:36:49,DRAGONTANOPUG,Its a ?
18-04-2018T19:36:59,Vatruvius,Do the answers not make sense?
18-04-2018T19:37:06,Zakuru,well
18-04-2018T19:37:09,DRAGONTANOPUG,Nota super obvious one
18-04-2018T19:37:13,MviluUatusun,What are your questions Zakuru?
18-04-2018T19:37:20,Bgrmystr2,actually it was a very super obvious one
18-04-2018T19:37:24,DRAGONTANOPUG,Zens just come back.
18-04-2018T19:37:26,Zakuru,math
18-04-2018T19:37:42,DRAGONTANOPUG,Brn dinner
18-04-2018T19:37:44,Bgrmystr2,so obvious that it smacked you upside your head and it stunned you so hard you couldn't comprehend what happened.
18-04-2018T19:37:46,DRAGONTANOPUG,Brb
18-04-2018T19:37:57,BadFoMo,Maddie: She must be trained in OP Stealth! Karen: She must be trained in OP Comic Relef! Maeve: Why not both? M&K: ...
18-04-2018T19:38:03,Dadrobit,"Back, had to go throw 10 000 Days in the stereo."
18-04-2018T19:38:06,Ordithus,It sure is nice to watch a stream after a hard day of work :)
18-04-2018T19:38:25,unsteddyphoenix,crack open an ice cold stream with the lads
18-04-2018T19:38:51,FoxxTrotter,Heh...they just had an earthquake in Detroit. That's somewhat uncommon.
18-04-2018T19:39:01,DRAGONTANOPUG,Back
18-04-2018T19:39:14,Bgrmystr2,"feels good, phoenix"
18-04-2018T19:39:26,FoxxTrotter,3.6 on the Richter Scale.
18-04-2018T19:39:41,ItsActuallyKopyKat,neato
18-04-2018T19:40:06,MviluUatusun,3.6?  That's rather strong for Detroit.
18-04-2018T19:40:42,FoxxTrotter,"The epicenter was actually on the other side of the river in Ontario, Canada, but only around 15 miles from downtown Detroit."
18-04-2018T19:41:14,DRAGONTANOPUG,"Im done playing Cod, i just went with 3 kills 43 deaths"
18-04-2018T19:41:17,Combak,"Not really. There's a old, small fault line there."
18-04-2018T19:41:24,CatzArt,Well at least my hometown of Cleveland is fine for now
18-04-2018T19:41:29,Combak,It just doesn't really do much anymore.
18-04-2018T19:42:09,Nekonny,o/
18-04-2018T19:42:15,FoxxTrotter,"Hiya, Neko."

18-04-2018T19:43:10,Twokinds,"Hoy, Ron!"
18-04-2018T19:43:14,BadFoMo,Yo.
18-04-2018T19:43:15,Bgrmystr2,I cannot imagine why Karen and Maddie would have such odds with each other
18-04-2018T19:43:20,Combak,Hi Ron!
18-04-2018T19:43:47,Bgrmystr2,so I'm curious to see this
18-04-2018T19:43:47,unsteddyphoenix,There can only be ONE
18-04-2018T19:43:47,Vatruvius,That is the point I think...it is a tease to us fans for when we get there in the comic.
18-04-2018T19:43:55,Bgrmystr2,yeah tis what I said earlier xD
18-04-2018T19:44:01,Ordithus,The rivalry itself is likely a prank
18-04-2018T19:44:04,DRAGONTANOPUG,If karen and maddie got in a fight....... maddie wins ultimately
18-04-2018T19:44:06,Zakuru,vat this doesn't make sense &gt;3&lt;
18-04-2018T19:44:07,Bgrmystr2,"prolly, Ord"
18-04-2018T19:44:10,HeresyArtStream,Maddie and Karen-- the world is not ready for this much genki. It will be like a particle collision. :cheresyartstream-adiramad:
18-04-2018T19:44:18,unsteddyphoenix,s'true
18-04-2018T19:44:31,Bgrmystr2,you need even MORAR genki Heresy
18-04-2018T19:44:40,unsteddyphoenix,They shouldve never been in the same room together
18-04-2018T19:44:41,FoxxTrotter,"I have to go back out. Later, everyone. :0)"

18-04-2018T20:35:01,unsteddyphoenix,^
18-04-2018T20:35:04,CrRAR,I think Rose is healing with juices
18-04-2018T20:35:15,Vatruvius,She has to be doing pretty well now...plus she is in her human for which Tom stated earlier means her wounds are gone for now.
18-04-2018T20:35:19,DRAGONTANOPUG,Or hot cocp
18-04-2018T20:35:33,DRAGONTANOPUG,Coco

18-04-2018T20:35:44,CrRAR,Trace probably has some special stuff in the magical icebox in the parlor
18-04-2018T20:35:44,MuonNeutrino,tom's gone back and forth on whether he wounds remain when she switches

18-04-2018T20:36:06,Vatruvius,Tom said earlier that they do not...but they will be there if she turns back into a wolf.

18-04-2018T20:36:32,MuonNeutrino,and he's gone back to drawing the bandage on her in the most recent comic
18-04-2018T20:36:33,Bgrmystr2,far as I recall
