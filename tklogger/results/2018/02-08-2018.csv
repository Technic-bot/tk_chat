02-08-2018T20:36:45,BadFoMo,No p0rnz.
02-08-2018T20:36:53,Combak,"In general, don't be a dick."
02-08-2018T20:36:54,Bgrmystr2,"For friday streams, no links without asking cuz Sage hosts the multistream each friday"
02-08-2018T20:39:43,BadFoMo,"Also, no copy/paste trolling. ...Or normal hateful trolling for that mater."
02-08-2018T20:39:59,kylemeta,ok so basic stream rules

02-08-2018T20:51:18,TheGamePlayer,Jk
02-08-2018T20:52:41,TheGamePlayer,"🤔I think Sage actually kicked me, it wasn't my fault it was a bit or whatever and we were warning them, me the most and I guess it seemed like spam"
02-08-2018T20:52:56,TheGamePlayer,*bor
02-08-2018T20:53:01,TheGamePlayer,*bot
02-08-2018T20:53:07,TheGamePlayer,Oops
02-08-2018T20:53:15,Bgrmystr2,"lol, you think Sage is the scary one, but sage warns people a bunch"
02-08-2018T20:53:33,Bgrmystr2,"if ya bothered tom to the point where he's had enough, he just bans outright"
02-08-2018T20:53:51,Bgrmystr2,"not a word given, just silences the problem"
02-08-2018T20:53:57,TorqueEmUp,Or just end the stream if he gets pissed off enough
02-08-2018T20:54:05,TorqueEmUp,Though i've never seen that yet
02-08-2018T20:54:10,Bgrmystr2,that was once lol
02-08-2018T20:54:16,TheGamePlayer,"No no, I don't think that, I'm just saying I came off as annoying but in the end apologies were said and the bot was banned"
02-08-2018T20:55:25,totallynotTrace,Hello peeps. anyone know if there is a stream tonight?

02-08-2018T20:57:50,Bgrmystr2,"he said won't be streaming tonight, he's burned out"

02-08-2018T20:57:59,Combak,"He's missed the last few streams, IIRC."
02-08-2018T20:58:03,Tharkis,i thought ron was doing a con this weekend and wasnt going to be around because of htat =D
02-08-2018T20:58:17,Bgrmystr2,he was doing somethin earlier
02-08-2018T20:58:19,Zakuru,i can understand ron right now
02-08-2018T20:58:23,SageSaga,Tom and I thought it would be best so we summoned up an elder thing to consume Ron
02-08-2018T20:58:26,Bgrmystr2,I don't think it was because of the con
02-08-2018T20:58:28,TheGamePlayer,Hi tharkis
02-08-2018T20:58:34,Bgrmystr2,cuz the con hasn't happened yet to burn him out
02-08-2018T20:58:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,poor ron
02-08-2018T20:58:40,unsteddyphoenix,What did the elder thing give you in return?
02-08-2018T20:58:42,unsteddyphoenix,For the sacrifice?
02-08-2018T20:58:44,Combak,And elder thing? Pft.

02-08-2018T20:59:10,SageSaga,a good deal on Dakimakura printing
02-08-2018T20:59:10,FoxxTrotter,"First day of the con was today, Bgr."

02-08-2018T20:59:49,TheGamePlayer,Hi Mary!!!
02-08-2018T20:59:52,HobbitGames,Hopefully i wont get too many disconnection errors this stream. Happened loads last ti e
02-08-2018T20:59:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Game
02-08-2018T20:59:55,TheGamePlayer,Marv
02-08-2018T20:59:57,HobbitGames,Tine*
02-08-2018T20:59:58,BadFoMo,*t'was?
02-08-2018T20:59:58,SageSaga,btw there is a chance if you buy one of our dakis it may turn into a perfect replica of the character it represents and will be your waifu for life
02-08-2018T21:00:11,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-excited:
02-08-2018T21:00:13,Combak,"Yeah... For some reason, I doubt that."
02-08-2018T21:00:13,TheGamePlayer,... my 10th typo in five seconds
02-08-2018T21:00:26,unsteddyphoenix,I want to believe here's all my money
02-08-2018T21:00:27,Bgrmystr2,get better at typing then
02-08-2018T21:00:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,gotta get those numbers up game
02-08-2018T21:00:38,LannAF,That's an expensive daki
02-08-2018T21:00:42,Combak,"... Wait, I get it now. A 0% chance!"
02-08-2018T21:01:05,TheGamePlayer,XD mrav
02-08-2018T21:01:13,TheGamePlayer,DANG IT
02-08-2018T21:01:13,SageSaga,i cannot type out the chances of it occurring because it would take me the rest of time to type it out even if i just held down a single number-
02-08-2018T21:01:20,SageSaga,but still - a chance
02-08-2018T21:01:39,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe that number is 9! :ptv-excited:
02-08-2018T21:01:47,Combak,How about if you did an exponential growth method?
02-08-2018T21:01:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,make it 11
02-08-2018T21:01:48,Bgrmystr2,yeah it'd be like a batshit amount of zeros between 0.x and x01
02-08-2018T21:01:59,BadFoMo,42?
02-08-2018T21:02:11,unsteddyphoenix,through chaos theory everything's possibly technically
02-08-2018T21:02:29,Twokinds,uh v=oh
02-08-2018T21:02:31,Combak,"I think it's string theory, not chaos theory."
02-08-2018T21:02:40,Combak,"Uh oh, what's wrong Tom?"
02-08-2018T21:02:41,BadFoMo,Whay?
02-08-2018T21:02:44,Bgrmystr2,oh no
02-08-2018T21:02:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,nani?
02-08-2018T21:02:47,BadFoMo,*What
02-08-2018T21:02:56,unsteddyphoenix,chaos theory works too
02-08-2018T21:03:04,Tharkis,if you summoned an elder thing to eat Ron before he finished my commission i'm going to be sad =(
02-08-2018T21:03:20,unsteddyphoenix,Does the elder thing do refunds :thinking:
02-08-2018T21:03:22,Mihari,summons a younger thing instead then.
02-08-2018T21:03:27,Bgrmystr2,"at least it was only an elder thing, tharkis"
02-08-2018T21:03:31,Bgrmystr2,not an eldritch thing
02-08-2018T21:03:35,Twokinds,My computers been acting up
02-08-2018T21:03:37,Bgrmystr2,cuz that's totally different
02-08-2018T21:03:37,FoxxTrotter,"Heh, go young."
02-08-2018T21:03:41,FoxxTrotter,"E'lo, Mihari."
02-08-2018T21:03:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Mihari's younger thing
02-08-2018T21:03:43,unsteddyphoenix,As long as it's not a mid-life crises ting
02-08-2018T21:03:44,HobbitGames,Oh No!
02-08-2018T21:03:47,Tharkis,flails :ctharkis-duster: at the younger thing

02-08-2018T21:34:22,HobbitGames,Well it is friday
02-08-2018T21:34:42,Dragonscalrarts,Awesome!
02-08-2018T21:34:44,Bgrmystr2,friday isn't always a comic

02-08-2018T21:35:02,HobbitGames,"Well, you know"
02-08-2018T21:35:08,Bgrmystr2,but it has been recently since this is the day he's had free
02-08-2018T21:35:14,Bgrmystr2,to draw the comic page lol
02-08-2018T21:35:27,HobbitGames,"Yeah, exactly"
02-08-2018T21:35:31,Bgrmystr2,since last month was two conventions
02-08-2018T21:36:05,Vatruvius,"Lampy? Sorry if I should have know, rest in peace...whoever you are Lampy."
02-08-2018T21:36:06,Bgrmystr2,It'll prolly go back to normal in the next few weeks
02-08-2018T21:36:13,LannAF,Sage!

02-08-2018T21:36:27,LannAF,Vatruvius!
02-08-2018T21:36:37,Vatruvius,Bgrmystr@
02-08-2018T21:36:39,Bgrmystr2,but I saw it on my pc recently
02-08-2018T21:36:40,Vatruvius,2!
02-08-2018T21:36:41,HobbitGames,Ahh. A return of inner-mind Natani
02-08-2018T21:36:42,Vatruvius,derp
02-08-2018T21:37:01,Dadrobit,Maximum efficiency on show
02-08-2018T21:37:02,HobbitGames,Noice
02-08-2018T21:37:04,Grishmark,Hello all
02-08-2018T21:37:07,Dadrobit,o/
02-08-2018T21:37:17,FoxxTrotter,"Hey, Grish."
02-08-2018T21:37:29,SageSaga,"Lann- far as i know, yes"
02-08-2018T21:37:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Maximum effort
02-08-2018T21:37:59,Vatruvius,"Oh, I have finally secured the funds to get my new computer. Fortunately I am splitting the cost with my parents, unfortunately they do not have the funds yet so I have bought everything else like the accessories and SSD, etc."
02-08-2018T21:38:01,Bgrmystr2,almighty all-knowing big brother google does not know of lampy
02-08-2018T21:38:19,Vatruvius,After the computer I get a new desk and finally the drawing tablet! So looking forward to drawing.
02-08-2018T21:38:21,Dadrobit,Use Bing
02-08-2018T21:38:23,Bgrmystr2,probably not the best idea vatru
02-08-2018T21:38:27,LannAF,noice
02-08-2018T21:38:30,Vatruvius,"Well, using technology anyway."
02-08-2018T21:38:36,Bgrmystr2,"if google doesn't know, why would bing know"
02-08-2018T21:38:59,HobbitGames,Ive been thinking of getting a drawing tablet. Still looking into it
02-08-2018T21:39:02,Dadrobit,"Because even if it doesn't, you still get Chipotle out of the deal."
02-08-2018T21:39:02,Vatruvius,What is not the best idea Bgr?
02-08-2018T21:39:08,Bgrmystr2,Bing did not know.
02-08-2018T21:39:26,Bgrmystr2,"Buying tech before you can build the entire system and put it together, Vatru"
02-08-2018T21:39:32,Bgrmystr2,is not a good idea
02-08-2018T21:39:34,Vatruvius,It is a laptop.
02-08-2018T21:39:40,Vatruvius,I am upgrading the SSD.
02-08-2018T21:39:46,HobbitGames,How much is it?
02-08-2018T21:39:47,Bgrmystr2,"lol, well okay"
02-08-2018T21:39:51,Twokinds,My comptuer is acting up so much
02-08-2018T21:39:57,Bgrmystr2,aw tom :(
02-08-2018T21:39:58,HobbitGames,Oh bi
02-08-2018T21:39:59,MarvTheHugPharaoh,oh no ;-;
02-08-2018T21:40:02,Twokinds,It's struggling to draw
02-08-2018T21:40:07,HobbitGames,Bi?
02-08-2018T21:40:09,Vatruvius,Did you try turning if off and back on again Tom?
02-08-2018T21:40:10,Vatruvius,XD
02-08-2018T21:40:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,do you want to hold off for a bit?
02-08-2018T21:40:20,CrimsonHelsing,that's not good. any technicians you can check with to have that looked at?
02-08-2018T21:40:25,Bgrmystr2,Just Reboot~ :v
02-08-2018T21:40:29,totallynotTrace,I upgraded my laptop to a ssd a few months ago. all whent well until i screwed in the underside pannel
02-08-2018T21:40:33,Bgrmystr2,doesn't always work of course
02-08-2018T21:40:40,unsteddyphoenix,he prolly tried that
02-08-2018T21:40:46,Vatruvius,"Yeah, got to be careful Trace."
02-08-2018T21:40:47,Bgrmystr2,yeah likely phoenix
02-08-2018T21:41:11,SageSaga,"Tom, give in - let go of your money- let Mihari build you a new system"
02-08-2018T21:41:11,Dustywrex,"Yooo, I saw ya 2 weeks ago at SDCC"
02-08-2018T21:41:18,Vatruvius,lol
02-08-2018T21:41:36,Vatruvius,"Yeah Tom, let all that money you have been saving blow away into the wind!"
02-08-2018T21:41:37,Vatruvius,XD
02-08-2018T21:41:47,totallynotTrace,the problem is that now one screw that is slightly longer than the other 7 or so is just stuck inside rotating. and i cant pull it out even though its loose
02-08-2018T21:41:59,SageSaga,"it's just 1,500 dollars"
02-08-2018T21:42:08,SageSaga,it will play your VR games
02-08-2018T21:42:11,HobbitGames,Just?
02-08-2018T21:42:15,unsteddyphoenix,thats walking around money /////sssss
02-08-2018T21:42:19,totallynotTrace,try a virus scan later perhaps?
02-08-2018T21:42:30,Bgrmystr2,yeah $1500 is pretty standard for a solid computer
02-08-2018T21:42:44,Vatruvius,You probably mixed up some screws Trace. One was probably suppose to connect to the upper chasis. Try removing the bottom plate and see where long screws are needed.
02-08-2018T21:42:45,Bgrmystr2,one that's for art can cost way more
02-08-2018T21:42:48,TorqueEmUp,Hell you can get a solid computer for $1k
02-08-2018T21:43:00,TorqueEmUp,"But if you have the funds, why not $1500"
02-08-2018T21:43:07,SageSaga,this one has a 1070Ti
02-08-2018T21:43:10,Bgrmystr2,$500 goes a long way
02-08-2018T21:43:11,Vatruvius,Nice.
02-08-2018T21:43:19,LannAF,That's how you end up spending all your money!
02-08-2018T21:43:33,HobbitGames,And what is the general purpose of this conputer in question?
02-08-2018T21:43:39,TorqueEmUp,Everything
02-08-2018T21:43:44,Vatruvius,"Save your money, buy an 1180 when it comes out. XD"
02-08-2018T21:43:51,Bgrmystr2,he uses it for everything
02-08-2018T21:44:07,HobbitGames,Literally everything a pc can be used for?
02-08-2018T21:44:16,qwe304,i built my pc for $700
02-08-2018T21:44:17,HobbitGames,Or laptop
02-08-2018T21:44:22,TorqueEmUp,Eww
02-08-2018T21:44:22,Bgrmystr2,it's the one he uses w/ his artpad and such
02-08-2018T21:44:27,Mihari,It will be next to impossible to get a 1180 when they launch
02-08-2018T21:44:36,Mihari,the miners will eat them up like candy
02-08-2018T21:44:42,SageSaga,not even sure if they are calling it 1180 right?
02-08-2018T21:44:46,TorqueEmUp,"Indeed, and are they really going to be that much better than a 1080ti? :P"
02-08-2018T21:44:52,Bgrmystr2,they're gonna cost an arm and a leg anyway
02-08-2018T21:44:53,SageSaga,rumors say they might call it a 2080
02-08-2018T21:44:56,Bgrmystr2,so no big deal
02-08-2018T21:44:56,ZoieFalcona,O.O
02-08-2018T21:45:10,qwe304,rumor is its gonna be called the 2080
02-08-2018T21:45:15,Vatruvius,It is either an 1180 or 2080
02-08-2018T21:45:16,qwe304,not 1180
02-08-2018T21:45:24,SageSaga,i just said that
02-08-2018T21:45:27,Vatruvius,"And yeah, all the crypto-miners will ruin everything."
02-08-2018T21:45:39,Vatruvius,Just confirming Sage.
02-08-2018T21:45:54,qwe304,yeah my gpu is still worth more than i bought it for two years ago
02-08-2018T21:45:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Zen face makes me happy
02-08-2018T21:46:06,SageSaga,Besides Tom - then you can try out Monster Hunter World with us!
02-08-2018T21:46:12,Vatruvius,lol
02-08-2018T21:46:29,TorqueEmUp,"Not mine though, my 1070 went from being worth like $600 like 6 months ago, to like $300 now."
02-08-2018T21:46:36,Vatruvius,I have been playing Dauntless which is another monster hunter game...in beta though.
02-08-2018T21:46:39,ZahnHolley,Hi guys
02-08-2018T21:46:42,Vatruvius,It is free to play however.
02-08-2018T21:46:51,totallynotTrace,hi zahn
02-08-2018T21:46:53,Bgrmystr2,"sounds like the price is still inflated then, qwe"
02-08-2018T21:47:02,Tharkis,i still want to play MH world when it's out on pc but i dont know how much time iactually will have to play =/
02-08-2018T21:47:08,TorqueEmUp,"I should have sold it then, and just bought another when the prices were low"
02-08-2018T21:47:22,Bgrmystr2,I don't have anyone to sell tech to
02-08-2018T21:47:26,Bgrmystr2,so I just kinda keep it
02-08-2018T21:47:32,CrRAR,"ooo, a youngtani"
02-08-2018T21:47:38,TorqueEmUp,"I've already had my time with MHW. Played it, got bored once it got to the grindy stuff. :P"
02-08-2018T21:47:40,Vatruvius,Speaking of old tech.
02-08-2018T21:47:58,LannAF,It's gonna hurt my soul paying for MHW
02-08-2018T21:48:09,SageSaga,what
02-08-2018T21:48:24,LannAF,it's my first 60$ gmae in a long time
02-08-2018T21:48:25,HobbitGames,Its gonna hurt my soul paying for fallout 76
02-08-2018T21:48:30,LannAF,I hope we'll be playing it a lot
02-08-2018T21:48:33,Vatruvius,"I was about to loosely offer one of my old tech to sell, but that would be advertising."
02-08-2018T21:48:39,SageSaga,ive spent 700 dollars on MHW Lann- 700!
02-08-2018T21:48:39,TorqueEmUp,I rarely pay full price for games too
02-08-2018T21:48:48,LannAF,can you spend 760 on it? ;3?
02-08-2018T21:48:52,LannAF,(I'm joking)
02-08-2018T21:49:07,SageSaga,i will Hammer Bro your face
02-08-2018T21:49:11,ZoieFalcona,*noms on a gingersnap
02-08-2018T21:49:14,LannAF,xD
02-08-2018T21:49:24,RimaDraws,o.o
02-08-2018T21:49:28,unsteddyphoenix,"""whats a little more at this point"""
02-08-2018T21:49:30,LannAF,I was intending on buying either PavlovVR or Onward
02-08-2018T21:49:36,LannAF,But I'd like to have someone to play VR games with
02-08-2018T21:49:53,SageSaga,one day you will step outside- and there i will be - standing on suspended bricks outside your house tossing endless hammers while jumping up and down
02-08-2018T21:49:54,LannAF,Tom do you think you'd like a co-op shooter in VR?
02-08-2018T21:50:03,MrEase,yo
02-08-2018T21:50:08,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Ease
02-08-2018T21:50:09,QuinnAuer,Hey Ease
02-08-2018T21:50:12,RimaDraws,hi ease
02-08-2018T21:50:14,Combak,Hi Ease!
02-08-2018T21:50:19,FoxxTrotter,"Hey, Ease."
02-08-2018T21:50:23,Vatruvius,I will pay to see that in real life Sage.
02-08-2018T21:50:28,Vatruvius,It would be glorious.
02-08-2018T21:51:18,SageSaga,if I am one thing- it is creative
02-08-2018T21:51:23,TorqueEmUp,I've been contemplating on a VR setup. But it'd be the PSVR since I ain't forking out big bucks for a PC setup.
02-08-2018T21:51:25,FoxxTrotter,:0)
02-08-2018T21:51:35,RimaDraws,i do like your art sage. saw some on your patreon
02-08-2018T21:51:50,FatCowMom,I am here
02-08-2018T21:51:50,SageSaga,ty
02-08-2018T21:51:50,totallynotTrace,the annoying thing is is that the screw is completely redundant and not needed
02-08-2018T21:51:58,RimaDraws,np ^^
02-08-2018T21:52:00,Bgrmystr2,heya cow
02-08-2018T21:52:04,totallynotTrace,oh that was supposed to be a wisper
02-08-2018T21:52:09,SageSaga,CowMom did it right
02-08-2018T21:52:16,LannAF,Tom is the only other person I know who has a VR setup
02-08-2018T21:52:25,ZahnHolley,"Im a lurker because my silent speaks volume,"
02-08-2018T21:52:26,LannAF,I'd really like to use it more
02-08-2018T21:52:30,Gundurr,"whew, I barely made"
02-08-2018T21:52:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Mommy
02-08-2018T21:52:32,LannAF,but..The expensiveness makes playing with friends hard
02-08-2018T21:52:36,FoxxTrotter,"Hey, Cow."
02-08-2018T21:52:38,Bgrmystr2,what's the minimum gpu you need for VR?
02-08-2018T21:52:47,SageSaga,1070
02-08-2018T21:52:54,Vatruvius,VR ready is the 10 series yes?
02-08-2018T21:52:55,Bgrmystr2,"ahh, expensive shit then"
02-08-2018T21:52:59,Gundurr,or 1060 6gb
02-08-2018T21:53:00,SageSaga,6GB 1060 might
02-08-2018T21:53:01,RimaDraws,i want to save up for a 1070
02-08-2018T21:53:07,RimaDraws,so i can game
02-08-2018T21:53:11,Bgrmystr2,nvm then
02-08-2018T21:53:12,Bgrmystr2,lol
02-08-2018T21:53:21,Gundurr,vr is a power hungry mess
02-08-2018T21:53:27,Vatruvius,My laptop has a 1070...hehehehe.
02-08-2018T21:53:32,Tharkis,fear my dual 660ti in SLI !
02-08-2018T21:53:35,Bgrmystr2,"meh, not worth imo"
02-08-2018T21:53:36,SageSaga,one of the Radeons can do it
02-08-2018T21:53:36,Vatruvius,lol
02-08-2018T21:53:37,Tharkis,i can ... run a 4k monitor !
02-08-2018T21:53:37,Gundurr,it will chew through your gpu like a sandwich
02-08-2018T21:53:38,TorqueEmUp,Also you need lots of physical space
02-08-2018T21:53:41,HobbitGames,"Hahahah my pc is so shit. I can run most things at like, 30 fps."
02-08-2018T21:53:43,SageSaga,well a couple of em
02-08-2018T21:53:51,TorqueEmUp,"I'd honestly would only want VR for shooters, and racers."
02-08-2018T21:53:53,RimaDraws,i dont want to play VRs
02-08-2018T21:53:53,SageSaga,one of the cheap ones is pretty good at it though for price point
02-08-2018T21:54:23,Dadrobit,Be back in a bit.
02-08-2018T21:54:24,TorqueEmUp,my CPU is a huge bottleneck
02-08-2018T21:54:25,Gundurr,"gtx 1070's are getting cheaper, you can even find a 1080 for $470"
02-08-2018T21:54:35,TorqueEmUp,garbage FX-6300
02-08-2018T21:54:44,Bgrmystr2,that's still more than I spend on my GPUs gundurr
02-08-2018T21:54:45,TorqueEmUp,Games hate it
02-08-2018T21:54:54,QuinnAuer,Nvidia GPU's are at about msrp's right now
02-08-2018T21:55:02,Gundurr,I have an i3 3200-t
02-08-2018T21:55:10,Bgrmystr2,"I'm running a Phenom II 955, Torque. It does just fine"
02-08-2018T21:55:10,QuinnAuer,it's a dip in the cryptocurrency market
02-08-2018T21:55:10,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, the crypto boom is kinda done with GPUs"
02-08-2018T21:55:18,HobbitGames,"I cant wait for the future, when today's high end technology becomes more mainstream, and cheap"
02-08-2018T21:55:24,SageSaga,oh hey- we are just a couple months away from Stranger things Season 3 right?
02-08-2018T21:55:34,QuinnAuer,"Some are speculating it could pick up again, but there are ASIC chips that do it better than gpu's now"
02-08-2018T21:55:35,RimaDraws,WHAT really?!
02-08-2018T21:55:42,RimaDraws,there's a season 3??
02-08-2018T21:55:43,Vatruvius,The crypto boom is down with the 10 series Torque
02-08-2018T21:55:46,TorqueEmUp,I doubt you are running 4k witht hat BGR lol
02-08-2018T21:55:47,Vatruvius,done*
02-08-2018T21:55:56,totallynotTrace,taking it to a tech would probably cost more than the laptop is worth (excluding ssd)
02-08-2018T21:56:01,TorqueEmUp,my 6300 bottlenecks the crap out of my 1070
02-08-2018T21:56:06,Tharkis,just 2 months from Castlevania Season 2 also Sage !
02-08-2018T21:56:10,totallynotTrace,again supposed to be a wisper im bad at this
02-08-2018T21:56:12,Bgrmystr2,"I could actually Torque. I have three 1080p displays right now, and still have a display port open"
02-08-2018T21:56:25,RimaDraws,i was hoping for a third season of stranger things
02-08-2018T21:56:35,TorqueEmUp,Well I doubt for very many games. lol
02-08-2018T21:56:44,ZahnHolley,"I.ll just meditate for awhile,"
02-08-2018T21:56:46,Bgrmystr2,"use em all the time, all three"
02-08-2018T21:56:58,Gundurr,"I seriously need a new pc, I can barely run firefox without everything crashing"
02-08-2018T21:57:07,Vatruvius,Eww...
02-08-2018T21:57:11,HobbitGames,Eww firefox
02-08-2018T21:57:16,TorqueEmUp,I remember my CPU before this one. a Phenom 8450e Triple core. lol
02-08-2018T21:57:17,SageSaga,dang the release date got pushed back to December 1st
02-08-2018T21:57:20,Bgrmystr2,I've got a 5760x1080 desktop resolution
02-08-2018T21:57:23,RimaDraws,nooooooooo
02-08-2018T21:57:25,Bgrmystr2,runs just fine
02-08-2018T21:57:27,SageSaga,for Stranger things
02-08-2018T21:57:49,Bgrmystr2,I just need a display port and I can add a fourth display
02-08-2018T21:58:01,Bgrmystr2,don't have a cable for that
02-08-2018T21:58:02,RimaDraws,but why was it pushed back ;;
02-08-2018T21:58:05,Gundurr,why cant we see the music?
02-08-2018T21:58:15,LannAF,sage
02-08-2018T21:58:18,Twokinds,Because the program that controls displaying the music has broken
02-08-2018T21:58:18,LannAF,I wasn't paying attention to chat
02-08-2018T21:58:22,Twokinds,Along with half my pc
02-08-2018T21:58:24,Vatruvius,Because no musice for you Gundurr.
02-08-2018T21:58:26,Gundurr,well darn
02-08-2018T21:58:28,LannAF,and I thought you meant that MHW got delayed to Dec1st
02-08-2018T21:58:30,Bgrmystr2,aw tom :/
02-08-2018T21:58:35,Vatruvius,Well shit Tom.
02-08-2018T21:58:35,SageSaga,XD
02-08-2018T21:58:36,LannAF,was gonna cry
02-08-2018T21:58:41,TorqueEmUp,Sound like time for a reinstall
02-08-2018T21:58:50,Twokinds,I just get a giant error message with a long string of random numbers
02-08-2018T21:58:55,unsteddyphoenix,something something backups
02-08-2018T21:58:58,Vatruvius,"Just download more RAM Tom, it should be fine."
02-08-2018T21:58:58,unsteddyphoenix,Woah
02-08-2018T21:58:59,Vatruvius,XD
02-08-2018T21:59:06,Gundurr,send those random numbers too us
02-08-2018T21:59:07,Bgrmystr2,"lol torque, it's prolly something that can be fixed without a reinstall"
02-08-2018T21:59:07,CrimsonHelsing,"at this point Tom, I'd recommend creating a backup right now for all your data"
02-08-2018T21:59:12,totallynotTrace,ok Tom at this point really would suggest runing some virus/malware scans
02-08-2018T21:59:16,Twokinds,"Yeah, man, I can't draw"
02-08-2018T21:59:19,TorqueEmUp,"when in doubt, reinstall windows cleanly"
02-08-2018T21:59:24,EggRollss,Rip
02-08-2018T21:59:24,HobbitGames,Hopefully its nothing extremely serious
02-08-2018T21:59:29,Twokinds,It keep stuttering on me
02-08-2018T21:59:36,RimaDraws,aw
02-08-2018T21:59:38,Twokinds,I'm afraid tonight might be a bust
02-08-2018T21:59:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,;-;
02-08-2018T21:59:43,Bgrmystr2,:(
02-08-2018T21:59:44,Mihari,"Guess, I'm really sure anything you guys can really suggest we've already suggested to Tom and he's done at this point."
02-08-2018T21:59:44,Vatruvius,Sounds like it is trying to run multiple things.
02-08-2018T21:59:44,unsteddyphoenix,That sucks.
02-08-2018T21:59:47,CrimsonHelsing,aw man :(
02-08-2018T21:59:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,ph well there is always next time
02-08-2018T21:59:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,oh even
02-08-2018T21:59:56,unsteddyphoenix,What can you do though
02-08-2018T22:00:01,Gundurr,"tell us whats happening, we are practically computers"
02-08-2018T22:00:04,Twokinds,I've ordered a new SSD that'll arrive tomorrow
02-08-2018T22:00:07,Vatruvius,"Probably Mihari, but we are going to suggest anyway!"
02-08-2018T22:00:11,unsteddyphoenix,Good call.
02-08-2018T22:00:13,RimaDraws,except me
02-08-2018T22:00:13,Vatruvius,XD
02-08-2018T22:00:19,RimaDraws,im not a computer lol
02-08-2018T22:00:21,Zakuru,phew
02-08-2018T22:00:24,Twokinds,"I am hoping it's a failing harddrive, and that replacing it with a fresh windows install will fix it"
02-08-2018T22:00:25,CrimsonHelsing,neither am I xD
02-08-2018T22:00:29,Gundurr,your brain is a computer
02-08-2018T22:00:39,TorqueEmUp,You can only hope.
02-08-2018T22:00:44,Gundurr,"that might work, tom"
02-08-2018T22:00:47,Bgrmystr2,"Tom if you go and get crystaldiskinfo, it'll tell you information about your disk"
02-08-2018T22:00:53,Twokinds,"Because if it's not that, then I don't know what it is"
02-08-2018T22:00:53,Bgrmystr2,and whether it's failing
02-08-2018T22:00:58,TorqueEmUp,Couldn't be any number of hardware related things.
02-08-2018T22:01:04,totallynotTrace,ssd's are good. just dont be like me. dont lock your computer shut by mixing up the screws XD
02-08-2018T22:01:04,TorqueEmUp,Could*
02-08-2018T22:01:09,unsteddyphoenix,It does sounds liek failing hardware from my very limited experience
02-08-2018T22:01:34,Raomay,Hi.
02-08-2018T22:01:39,Bgrmystr2,there's always ways to find out what's erroring
02-08-2018T22:01:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Raomay
02-08-2018T22:01:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"When my laptop’s hard drive crashed, it started screaming at me"
02-08-2018T22:01:56,EggRollss,Hey
02-08-2018T22:02:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-sleepoverA: KIWI!!!!!!
02-08-2018T22:02:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Especially if I touched keys
02-08-2018T22:02:10,HobbitGames,Im so bad with computers.
02-08-2018T22:02:12,Gundurr,"I am very much a computer nerd. It might be storage thing, but it could also be a minor processing problem"
02-08-2018T22:02:19,SpazztasticKiwi,MARV !!!!! :ctwokinds-sleepoverB:
02-08-2018T22:02:19,Bgrmystr2,I don't have the money to buy multiple SSDs to make sure I don't lose data
02-08-2018T22:02:24,Bgrmystr2,Hey Kiwi
02-08-2018T22:02:31,SpazztasticKiwi,I can imagine us doing that in real life
02-08-2018T22:02:31,Vatruvius,The stuttering just tells me that the CPU is slow to respond to the input of drawing...would I be wrong to think that something is happening to the CPU if not the OS? Any serious tech nerds?
02-08-2018T22:02:46,Bgrmystr2,"ehh, vatru"
02-08-2018T22:02:47,SpazztasticKiwi,People outside like “they ok?”
02-08-2018T22:02:50,Bgrmystr2,it could be a load of things
02-08-2018T22:02:52,Gundurr,"that might be it, Vat"
02-08-2018T22:02:55,Bgrmystr2,that's just one of prolly hundreds
02-08-2018T22:03:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Hey 🍔
02-08-2018T22:03:00,Bgrmystr2,of different possibilities
02-08-2018T22:03:12,Twokinds,I've already tested the CPU
02-08-2018T22:03:13,SageSaga,Mihari and I have gone over it pretty extensively
02-08-2018T22:03:26,Bgrmystr2,see ^
02-08-2018T22:03:53,Vatruvius,Hmm...
02-08-2018T22:03:56,Gundurr,"its the processors job to sort information, its the storages job to give the necessary information, and it;s the GPU's job to handle graphics"
02-08-2018T22:03:59,TorqueEmUp,Yeah somehow I doubt it's only the HDD. Studdering would only happen if things were constantly getting paged in and out of your current HDD if you were running out of RAM.
02-08-2018T22:04:01,SageSaga,and Mihari knows much more about it than I do and I'm no push over when it comes to tech
02-08-2018T22:04:07,Vatruvius,And you are sure turning it off and back on again does not fix it? XD
02-08-2018T22:04:21,Bgrmystr2,vatru pls
02-08-2018T22:04:28,Vatruvius,And I am back into CS 101...
02-08-2018T22:04:29,Gundurr,"unlikely that would help, Vat"
02-08-2018T22:04:30,Zakuru,mmm can i afford another break?
02-08-2018T22:04:30,ZRO4825,huzzah for finally getting home! \'.'/
02-08-2018T22:04:31,Vatruvius,Thanks Gundurr.
02-08-2018T22:04:38,RimaDraws,hi zro
02-08-2018T22:04:38,MarvTheHugPharaoh,\[T]/
02-08-2018T22:04:41,SageSaga,welcome home Zro
02-08-2018T22:04:41,SpazztasticKiwi,If it s broken you can always defenestrate it
02-08-2018T22:04:41,ZRO4825,"Yes, Zaku, yes you can."
02-08-2018T22:04:47,ZRO4825,Tyty~
02-08-2018T22:04:47,Bgrmystr2,studder is caused by a lot more than just HDD / CPU Torque
02-08-2018T22:04:51,FoxxTrotter,"E'lo, ZRO."
02-08-2018T22:04:52,Bgrmystr2,heya Zro
02-08-2018T22:04:56,Zakuru,i have 3 more drawings to do
02-08-2018T22:04:57,Bgrmystr2,welcome home :)
02-08-2018T22:05:01,Zakuru,and its 11..
02-08-2018T22:05:11,TorqueEmUp,@BGR I was only say that I doubt it's a HDD issue.
02-08-2018T22:05:16,TorqueEmUp,saying&
02-08-2018T22:05:18,Gundurr,"I believe in you, Zak"
02-08-2018T22:05:27,SpazztasticKiwi,Good thing Jack likes to chatter on about computer tech cause otherwise I’d be completely lost
02-08-2018T22:05:39,Bgrmystr2,"well, I trust that they've tested a great many things"
02-08-2018T22:05:42,HobbitGames,Its soooooo late. I have to get some sleep. By
02-08-2018T22:05:47,Bgrmystr2,gnight then
02-08-2018T22:05:58,Gundurr,nobody that I know personally have any idea how to access their files on their pc
02-08-2018T22:06:00,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, well testing will only get you so far. Could be a motherboard issue"
02-08-2018T22:06:09,TorqueEmUp,who knows
02-08-2018T22:06:19,Bgrmystr2,"xD Testing actually gets you to the problem, torque"
02-08-2018T22:06:20,TorqueEmUp,a faulty cap somwhere
02-08-2018T22:06:20,Gundurr,"you know, it could be a MB problem"
02-08-2018T22:06:32,Bgrmystr2,it doesn't have a limit
02-08-2018T22:06:36,TorqueEmUp,What I mean is test through means of software
02-08-2018T22:06:40,Gundurr,the MB is responsible for directory power and information
02-08-2018T22:06:55,Gundurr,transfer
02-08-2018T22:07:07,Bgrmystr2,"noone worth their salt only tests via software if it's serious enough, though so no big deal :)"
02-08-2018T22:07:08,TorqueEmUp,sure you can rip stuff out of the tower and test it with a multimeter or oscilloscope.
02-08-2018T22:07:24,ZRO4825,I usually test everything with a cat.
02-08-2018T22:07:27,Gundurr,thats too technical
02-08-2018T22:07:32,TorqueEmUp,if you have that hardware laying around and know what you're doing. lol
02-08-2018T22:07:34,Bgrmystr2,lol zro
02-08-2018T22:07:40,Zakuru,time to upload some stuff on DA and FA
02-08-2018T22:07:40,TorqueEmUp,no shit gundurr. :P
02-08-2018T22:07:41,Vatruvius,lol
02-08-2018T22:07:43,ZRO4825,"Attach cat to the computer. If cat looks at you like ""wtf u doin?"" computer is fine."
02-08-2018T22:07:52,Bgrmystr2,"logical, zro"
02-08-2018T22:07:56,Bgrmystr2,cats clearly know all
02-08-2018T22:07:56,ZRO4825,"If cat claws you, computer is maybe fine, maybe not. Cat is not sure."
02-08-2018T22:08:09,Tharkis,meow? :ctharkis-hiss:
02-08-2018T22:08:11,Bgrmystr2,"if cat dies, you're already ded?"
02-08-2018T22:08:14,ZRO4825,"If cat decides your computer is now litter box, computer was screwed."
02-08-2018T22:08:14,Vatruvius,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
02-08-2018T22:08:22,TorqueEmUp,Hell even a wonky power supply could cause issues.
02-08-2018T22:08:29,Gundurr,yep
02-08-2018T22:08:44,ZRO4825,"If cat dies, I question your choices in owning a computer AND a cat. :thinking:"
02-08-2018T22:08:47,EggRollss,Let me try that real quick brb
02-08-2018T22:09:09,Bgrmystr2,"well at that point, zro, I think the computer is probably nuclear"
02-08-2018T22:09:12,Bgrmystr2,or toxic
02-08-2018T22:09:15,Gundurr,it can be any of the 7 things that go into a computer
02-08-2018T22:09:19,unsteddyphoenix,Is this some sort of schrodingers cat situation
02-08-2018T22:09:24,unsteddyphoenix,except a pc not a box
02-08-2018T22:09:38,Bgrmystr2,7 things that go into a computer? Gundurr you do know there's way more than just 7 right
02-08-2018T22:09:43,TorqueEmUp,there is more than 7 things in a computers
02-08-2018T22:09:46,Bgrmystr2,XD
02-08-2018T22:09:48,Gundurr,7 is the minimum
02-08-2018T22:09:55,Bgrmystr2,"well, not true"
02-08-2018T22:09:57,TorqueEmUp,"more like hundres, if not thousands of little ones. :P"
02-08-2018T22:10:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Nah there’s one thing
02-08-2018T22:10:16,Gundurr,im not talking about transistor counts!
02-08-2018T22:10:16,Bgrmystr2,"technically, you only need what.. 3?"
02-08-2018T22:10:21,SpazztasticKiwi,The magic fairies
02-08-2018T22:10:22,Bgrmystr2,"motherboard, cpu, ram"
02-08-2018T22:10:25,Bgrmystr2,that's it
02-08-2018T22:10:30,Bgrmystr2,and your pc will post
02-08-2018T22:10:36,Gundurr,what about storage and power?
02-08-2018T22:10:38,Bgrmystr2,"not user-friendly, of course"
02-08-2018T22:10:55,Bgrmystr2,harddrive unneeded for motherboard post
02-08-2018T22:11:12,TorqueEmUp,"You got to count every single resistor, cap, chip, etc."
02-08-2018T22:11:19,Bgrmystr2,Torque no xD
02-08-2018T22:11:23,Bgrmystr2,no you don't
02-08-2018T22:11:26,TorqueEmUp,Hey just being technical here
02-08-2018T22:11:27,Gundurr,"that is just a headache, torque"

02-08-2018T22:12:06,unsteddyphoenix,"I could see you trying lol, unfortunate"
02-08-2018T22:12:08,Gundurr,"man, I wish I could be of some use, but I cant see your computer"
02-08-2018T22:12:18,RimaDraws,i wish i could but i cant
02-08-2018T22:12:23,Twokinds,Here's something I painted befeore my computer broke

02-08-2018T22:18:21,Vatruvius,I mean...can you blame him.
02-08-2018T22:18:31,Vatruvius,Probably Tharkis.
02-08-2018T22:18:34,Bgrmystr2,"who, Vatru"

02-08-2018T22:19:50,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Dad is right

02-08-2018T22:30:58,Combak,The question was if he was finishing.
02-08-2018T22:31:14,Vatruvius,"Micro explosion goes off, mushroom cloud erupts from case."
02-08-2018T22:31:15,Combak,"... And since he did, Thanks for streaming Tom! XD"
02-08-2018T22:31:18,BluePhantom90,"Hey Tom I have been wanting to ask. I have a sketch idea of a village, just wondering if that is alright with you?"

02-08-2018T22:32:36,Bgrmystr2,"I would say, you can check your task manager if you're quck"
02-08-2018T22:32:37,SpazztasticKiwi,And I thought I had a bad attention span
02-08-2018T22:32:39,Vatruvius,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:

02-08-2018T22:34:48,Bgrmystr2,actually
02-08-2018T22:34:53,Combak,Considering the viewpoint could shift? Anything.
02-08-2018T22:34:56,CrRAR,Zen revealed to be a robot.
02-08-2018T22:34:58,Vatruvius,The 3rd floor door!

02-08-2018T22:35:06,unsteddyphoenix,"Who would the viewpoint shift to lol, the groups are together"
02-08-2018T22:35:06,ZRO4825,"Zen could look at Kat and be all like *eyebrow wiggle* ""So you wanna check how crippled I am?"""
02-08-2018T22:35:11,Combak,"Oh, he's Zenyetta?"
02-08-2018T22:35:15,MarvTheHugPharaoh,-_-

02-08-2018T22:35:28,SpazztasticKiwi,Plot twist: 3rd flirt is just a trampoline room
02-08-2018T22:35:29,Bgrmystr2,wigglewaggle
02-08-2018T22:35:34,SpazztasticKiwi,*floor

02-08-2018T22:36:35,BadFoMo,"So, he's done for tonight?"
02-08-2018T22:36:37,CrRAR,bye
02-08-2018T22:36:37,unsteddyphoenix,PIckup lines generally work better when you have large boobers on your side
02-08-2018T22:36:50,Bgrmystr2,well yeah Fomo
02-08-2018T22:36:52,SpazztasticKiwi,Well shit then

02-08-2018T22:37:02,unsteddyphoenix,"Or, any bobs, if im being honest."
02-08-2018T22:37:11,Bgrmystr2,"your priorities are buggard, mate"
02-08-2018T22:37:40,BadFoMo,I have work tomarow.
02-08-2018T22:37:46,ZRO4825,My pick-up lines never work well when boobs are involved. I always end up empty-handed. :V
02-08-2018T22:37:48,Vatruvius,"Tom, if you are still present in the stream, do you use just Ps for Twokinds and all the sketches/colors?"
02-08-2018T22:38:06,Dadrobit,I'm considering just going back to the goatee when I can get my proper ponytail going again.
02-08-2018T22:38:07,SageSaga,he does
02-08-2018T22:38:08,unsteddyphoenix,(yes)
02-08-2018T22:38:14,Vatruvius,Or you could just talk and not use a pick up line Zro.
02-08-2018T22:38:14,Dadrobit,Whisper fail...
02-08-2018T22:38:20,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
02-08-2018T22:38:39,Vatruvius,"Good to know, thanks Sage."
02-08-2018T22:39:00,ZRO4825,"Tried that too, Vatru. Turns out people are complicated. :x"
02-08-2018T22:39:12,Vatruvius,Well no shit! Really!?
02-08-2018T22:39:19,Vatruvius,:ctwokinds-NataniHAHA:
02-08-2018T22:39:38,Dadrobit,Pick up lines are the best tbh
02-08-2018T22:39:52,CrRAR,the spice of life
02-08-2018T22:40:02,Combak,I'd wait for a girl to say that.
02-08-2018T22:40:13,Dadrobit,I wish more girls used them on me. Alas.
02-08-2018T22:40:23,Vatruvius,Don't we all Dadro.
02-08-2018T22:40:23,CrRAR,lol
02-08-2018T22:40:26,Bgrmystr2,I'd only expect pickup lines to be used as a joke
02-08-2018T22:40:30,Bgrmystr2,not seriously
02-08-2018T22:40:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ctwokinds-kingtea:
02-08-2018T22:40:47,unsteddyphoenix,Sometimes they can be pretty creative
02-08-2018T22:40:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Hey get her to laugh and you at least have her attention
02-08-2018T22:40:49,CrRAR,No pickup line that ever worked is a bad one
02-08-2018T22:41:00,ZRO4825,"Oh god, I saw one the other day that was a great joke, lol, I'll have to see if I can find it again"
02-08-2018T22:41:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw a pun the other day that made me mad
02-08-2018T22:41:22,Bgrmystr2,"you won't need a pickup line for that, kiwi lol"
02-08-2018T22:41:27,Vatruvius,"""If it is stupid but it works, then it isn't stupid."" ~ MightyJingles"

02-08-2018T22:41:42,Bgrmystr2,xD
02-08-2018T22:41:46,CrRAR,lol
02-08-2018T22:41:51,Vatruvius,Tell that to Jingles.
02-08-2018T22:41:53,Bgrmystr2,some stupid things actually work
02-08-2018T22:42:03,Bgrmystr2,"hey, some ppl's elevators don't go all the way up to the brain, Vatru"
02-08-2018T22:42:06,Bgrmystr2,can't help that :V
02-08-2018T22:42:12,Vatruvius,lol

02-08-2018T22:42:20,ZahnHolley,Sniff...
02-08-2018T22:45:05,SpazztasticKiwi,Ive been asked “How many pieces of chicken is in the 8 piece chicken?”
02-08-2018T22:45:17,MarvTheHugPharaoh,7
02-08-2018T22:45:19,Bgrmystr2,perfect example
02-08-2018T22:45:23,Bgrmystr2,right there
02-08-2018T22:45:23,SpazztasticKiwi,I wonder if I’m on candid camera sometimes
02-08-2018T22:45:30,Bgrmystr2,maybe
02-08-2018T22:45:32,Bgrmystr2,maybe you are
02-08-2018T22:46:08,SageSaga,Zro?
02-08-2018T22:46:14,Bgrmystr2,"the one thing that bothers me is that a dozen is 12, a baker's dozen is 13.. like. the fuck lol"
02-08-2018T22:46:31,Bgrmystr2,the one instance where the user is bamboozled
02-08-2018T22:46:36,ZRO4825,Yo?
02-08-2018T22:46:40,SageSaga,bakers Dozen is a dozen and 1 to try
02-08-2018T22:46:46,SageSaga,Hows this Zro?
02-08-2018T22:46:55,SpazztasticKiwi,It stems from the baker making that 13th doughnut supposedly for him/herself or as a spare
02-08-2018T22:47:05,ZRO4825,"Looks good, didn't expect the mid-riff I admit, but it works well. =D"
02-08-2018T22:47:16,Bgrmystr2,lolo
02-08-2018T22:47:18,Bgrmystr2,this is nice
02-08-2018T22:47:18,SageSaga,it's not a mid-riff
02-08-2018T22:47:39,SageSaga,just part of the original sketch to get proportions right
02-08-2018T22:47:47,ZRO4825,"Well then, either way, Lookin good to me ^^b"
02-08-2018T22:48:20,Dadrobit,"I read mid-riff, and I think of an awesome drum fill in the middle of a guitar solo."
02-08-2018T22:48:54,SageSaga,brb!
02-08-2018T22:49:58,kylemeta,gtb talk with y'all later
02-08-2018T22:51:59,Vatruvius,I am back! Hazza!
02-08-2018T22:52:01,CrRAR,wait I thought a baker's dozen was 24... is it really 13?
02-08-2018T22:52:04,Vatruvius,:ptv-greetings:
02-08-2018T22:52:07,Combak,WB Vat.
02-08-2018T22:52:12,unsteddyphoenix,lmao yes cr
02-08-2018T22:52:14,Combak,"Yeah, baker's dozen is 13."
02-08-2018T22:52:19,Vatruvius,Weird.
02-08-2018T22:52:20,CrRAR,oh lol
02-08-2018T22:52:22,CrRAR,xD
02-08-2018T22:52:53,CrRAR,I always just thought it was a larger unit of measure for baking... applications
02-08-2018T22:53:16,CrRAR,TIL
02-08-2018T22:53:39,Vatruvius,"To be honest, I have heard of a bakers dozen once...somewhere. And that is about it."
02-08-2018T22:53:45,Vatruvius,Nothing else.
02-08-2018T22:55:09,CrRAR,Whatever baker only makes one for him/herself is being stingy.
02-08-2018T22:55:15,CrRAR,Gotta indulge
02-08-2018T22:55:22,Bgrmystr2,"the whole idea is silly to me to begin with. if you're gonna make one extra for yourself, why TELL people about it? just make one dozen and another for yourself"
02-08-2018T22:55:22,Vatruvius,lol
02-08-2018T22:55:27,Bgrmystr2,and noone's the wiser
02-08-2018T22:55:37,CrRAR,yeah!
02-08-2018T22:55:52,Combak,I assumed it was due to the bread ends...
02-08-2018T22:55:53,Bgrmystr2,"once you name it, someone's gonna want all 13 instead of 12."
02-08-2018T22:55:59,Combak,"But that would need two extra, not one."
02-08-2018T22:56:01,Dadrobit,Can't think of any clever pick up lines at the moment. Be back later.
02-08-2018T22:56:04,Bgrmystr2,"and at that point, ya fucked up"
02-08-2018T22:56:08,CrRAR,It's almost like a joke term now that I know what it really is
02-08-2018T22:56:10,Bgrmystr2,alright dadro
02-08-2018T22:56:22,Vatruvius,I think I will spend a good portion of my upcoming vacation thinking about my comic and setting up a story. Seems like the perfect time to do it.
02-08-2018T22:56:27,CrRAR,keiththinking.gif

02-08-2018T23:01:15,Vatruvius,Makes sense.
02-08-2018T23:01:17,unsteddyphoenix,"Is it Felix, Tom?"
02-08-2018T23:01:22,Bgrmystr2,"guessing you haven't seen the anime, vatru"

02-08-2018T23:01:54,ZRO4825,Felix is not a trap.
02-08-2018T23:02:01,SageSaga,"Felix is best ""girl"""
02-08-2018T23:02:05,ZRO4825,Felix is a fucking ambush.
02-08-2018T23:02:16,Bgrmystr2,ambush is still a trap
02-08-2018T23:02:20,Bgrmystr2,:U
02-08-2018T23:02:29,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Calling it, Astolfo is best girl"
02-08-2018T23:02:35,Vatruvius,"I have a hard time getting into anime, I just do. And I am slowing getting into comics so it is a slow process. Exactly how far I will has yet to be determined."
02-08-2018T23:02:59,ZRO4825,"Shut yer mouth, Bgr, with that logic, you silly Kisahakurei. D:"
02-08-2018T23:03:04,Bgrmystr2,it's not difficult. just find one in a genre you like to watch
02-08-2018T23:03:08,TheBeckoner,Jojo is best girl

02-08-2018T23:04:22,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I love him
02-08-2018T23:04:42,SageSaga,"someone said ""If he's been without water for 4 days he is probably dead, that's the longest on record you can go"""
02-08-2018T23:05:02,SageSaga,"and i was like ""I researched this- a guy went 18 days without water"
02-08-2018T23:05:07,ZRO4825,KIriSAme Hakurei! :P
02-08-2018T23:05:19,Bgrmystr2,Nuh
02-08-2018T23:05:24,Bgrmystr2,don't just shorten it randomnly
02-08-2018T23:05:26,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"18 days, was he like beef jerky by the end?"
02-08-2018T23:05:29,ZRO4825,"Iz new abbreviation, I mades it. Just like snep."
02-08-2018T23:05:29,unsteddyphoenix,Hmmmmm :thinking:
02-08-2018T23:05:44,Vatruvius,I thought he would be dead too but then the thought hit me that he is literally doing nothing so the amount of water his body would be using would be minimal compared to someone looking for water in a forest or something.
02-08-2018T23:05:46,Bgrmystr2,snep is a stupid abbreviation and so is that XD
02-08-2018T23:05:47,SageSaga,pretty much- he was thrown in jail and they forgot about him (The cells were in the basement)
02-08-2018T23:05:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,oof
02-08-2018T23:06:10,TheBeckoner,I mean if you forget you may as well let them go
02-08-2018T23:06:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,they made a souls hollow by accident
02-08-2018T23:06:14,ZRO4825,"I'm not arguing that at all, Bgr. :P"
02-08-2018T23:06:41,Bgrmystr2,good
02-08-2018T23:06:42,SageSaga,still - on average with minimal movement and good conditions you could go for a week or a little more
02-08-2018T23:07:00,SageSaga,dangerous regardless
02-08-2018T23:07:07,SageSaga,dont try it folks
02-08-2018T23:07:13,TheBeckoner,Just drink the cloud juice
02-08-2018T23:07:17,TheBeckoner,not hard
02-08-2018T23:07:25,Vatruvius,That is going to be one dry throat when he wakes up.
02-08-2018T23:08:34,SageSaga,if he wakes up
02-08-2018T23:09:09,SageSaga,if he's even a person anymore and not a copy... if hes not already dead-
02-08-2018T23:09:24,SageSaga,if he was ever real to begin with O_O
02-08-2018T23:09:51,MarvTheHugPharaoh,spooky.... I like it
02-08-2018T23:09:54,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-shock:
02-08-2018T23:10:00,Bgrmystr2,sage plsssssss
02-08-2018T23:10:03,Bgrmystr2,don't do this
02-08-2018T23:10:51,SageSaga,im trying to get people to consider all the options :P
02-08-2018T23:11:13,ZRO4825,OMG they're making a new 2D side-scroller based on Record of Lodoss War o_o
02-08-2018T23:11:16,Bgrmystr2,yeah I see that
02-08-2018T23:11:47,ZRO4825,That is awesome! &lt;3  Loved Record of Lodoss War.
02-08-2018T23:12:34,Bgrmystr2,Haven't seen it
02-08-2018T23:13:04,SageSaga,old school fantasy anime
02-08-2018T23:13:14,ZRO4825,"Was good anime. Unfortunately has some iffy moments due to budgeting issues (supposedly) back when it was made, but overall pretty decent imo. Then again I'm not SUPER picky either, so, I may not be critical enough."
02-08-2018T23:13:45,Bgrmystr2,yeah I know of it
02-08-2018T23:13:51,ZRO4825,Still see the occasional piece of Deedlit or Pirotess art these days.
02-08-2018T23:19:24,Vatruvius,Well I better get off. Thanks for stream Tom and Sage. Goodnight! :ptv-greetings:

02-08-2018T23:19:55,Tharkis,Lodoss-tou Senki was so totally based on / directly influenced by margrett weiss and tracy hickman's dragonlance novels
02-08-2018T23:20:16,TheBeckoner,Goodnight Vat
02-08-2018T23:20:41,Tharkis,waaayy too many parallels and direct repeats of things that happen in dragonlance and lodoss to be coincidence heh
02-08-2018T23:21:46,Tharkis,i know someone who still commissions lots of deedlit art even after all these years =P
02-08-2018T23:22:10,Tharkis,"anyhow, on that note, i'm going to go crash in bed.  Thanks for the stream Sage !"
