08-09-2018T11:16:55,Combak,Hey all.
08-09-2018T11:42:20,Combak,Uh oh... Tom didn't put up a suggestion thing on Patreon. I guess we'll just use the old suggestions then?
08-09-2018T11:42:30,KittyLoveless,üêæüêæüêæüêæüêæüêæüêæüêæüêæüêæüêæüêæüêæüòº
08-09-2018T11:42:35,Combak,Hi!
08-09-2018T11:42:35,KittyLoveless,hello
08-09-2018T11:56:12,boiguy123,hello peeps
08-09-2018T12:11:18,michal1999102,hi
08-09-2018T13:03:16,autoenigma,hello
08-09-2018T13:06:08,autoenigma,i hope his hand is doing better this week
08-09-2018T13:17:40,Twokinds,:ctwokinds-flomad:
08-09-2018T13:18:26,Xexanoth,so is that good or bad?
08-09-2018T13:20:04,Twokinds,"After yesterday's stream I lost power, and haven't had power until now"
08-09-2018T13:20:21,Twokinds,So now I'm even more behind on everything.
08-09-2018T13:20:37,Twokinds,I couldn't get any sketch done for today.
08-09-2018T13:23:42,Xexanoth,"dam, my condolences(if that sound weird i don't know any other apporpriate word in english), not having power sucks :/"
08-09-2018T13:24:33,Twokinds,Yeah it's rediculous how often our home loses power.
08-09-2018T13:25:02,Combak,Hey Tom!
08-09-2018T13:25:14,Combak,So that's what was going on!
08-09-2018T13:26:13,iliar,"@Twokinds Tom, could you help me. I have a dispute with one person about the 976 page. Does Flora really expected Keidran-skinned rugs? Or I was sarcasm?"
08-09-2018T13:28:42,Combak,"Considering Trace was surprised, I'd say it wasn't sarcasm... At best, hyperbole."
08-09-2018T13:29:48,SpazztasticKiwi,I could consider it as exaggeration
08-09-2018T13:31:19,SpazztasticKiwi,And jeez power out again. Power company wouldn‚Äôt like me too much
08-09-2018T13:32:45,Combak,It's probably got something to do with all the rain we've been getting recently... And possibly in the incoming hurricanes.
08-09-2018T13:33:29,SpazztasticKiwi,We had a flood üåß come through n the power was ok
08-09-2018T13:34:18,autoenigma,@Twokinds i think you might want to use the sketch ideas from last week for this week due to last sunday and your power incident today
08-09-2018T13:34:27,autoenigma,*yesterday
08-09-2018T13:50:28,Combak,"With rain comes wind, which can take out tree branches and power line... Especially since the Emerald Ash Borer left a lot of dead trees for us."
08-09-2018T13:51:09,Combak,"Hurricanes means there's less people around to repair them, since some people would have gone to areas hit by the hurricane to do repairs."
08-09-2018T13:51:29,Twokinds,Yeah obviously
08-09-2018T13:54:16,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds I'll definitely be watching. I really like these streams.
08-09-2018T14:00:31,PalmettoPathfinder1,@CrimsonQuill sorry I haven't submitted the dinosaur request in yet.  I also just found out that Tom lost power recently.
08-09-2018T14:01:11,PalmettoPathfinder1,I hope there is still time to submit it though or is Tom not doing a stream today?
08-09-2018T14:04:07,PalmettoPathfinder1,Also...Send some of that rain over to us here in the Palmetto State!!!  We're dying over here!!!
08-09-2018T14:04:27,SpazztasticKiwi,We got a storm last night. Have some mud
08-09-2018T14:04:35,Twokinds,Please take it all
08-09-2018T14:04:38,Twokinds,It just keeps raining
08-09-2018T14:04:51,PalmettoPathfinder1,I'm super jealous now of you Tom!
08-09-2018T14:04:54,SpazztasticKiwi,WetKinds
08-09-2018T14:05:05,Twokinds,You would not be jealous if you keep losing power
08-09-2018T14:05:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Well cats do hate water
08-09-2018T14:05:10,BluePhantom90,I like the Rain
08-09-2018T14:05:32,SpazztasticKiwi,I only like it if I don‚Äôt have to drive that day
08-09-2018T14:05:33,PalmettoPathfinder1,So no stream today? And nah.  Gives me time to catch up on my reading.  :)
08-09-2018T14:05:42,boiguy123,tom feel happy you have moist weather i have extremely dry weather
08-09-2018T14:06:15,PalmettoPathfinder1,Yeah it's dry here and I'm struggling to keep my flowers alive!  I've trying to keep them watered!
08-09-2018T14:06:26,SpazztasticKiwi,If your powers out how are you here? Positive thinking?
08-09-2018T14:06:45,Twokinds,It only came back recently
08-09-2018T14:06:56,Twokinds,"Tomorrow is Sunday, today is Saturday"
08-09-2018T14:06:58,PalmettoPathfinder1,Probably has a hamster powered generator.
08-09-2018T14:07:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Half expected you to just say ‚Äúspite‚Äù
08-09-2018T14:07:23,PalmettoPathfinder1,What?  Today is Sunday
08-09-2018T14:07:38,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom today‚Äôs Sunday
08-09-2018T14:07:39,Twokinds,The universe took my Saturday! I'm taking it back!
08-09-2018T14:07:55,PalmettoPathfinder1,Too late!  You can't take it back!
08-09-2018T14:08:19,PalmettoPathfinder1,Unless you contract Stevie Griffin to build you a time machine.
08-09-2018T14:08:29,PalmettoPathfinder1,*Stewie
08-09-2018T14:09:04,PalmettoPathfinder1,But seriously no stream today I'm guessing.
08-09-2018T14:09:17,SpazztasticKiwi,Double Saturday would explain why they tried calling me in
08-09-2018T14:09:25,CrimsonQuill,Have you guys forgotten about a certain Mad Man in a Telephone box?
08-09-2018T14:09:43,CrimsonQuill,He could get one's Saturday back.
08-09-2018T14:09:58,PalmettoPathfinder1,I thought it was a woman now.
08-09-2018T14:10:10,SpazztasticKiwi,The new doctor is
08-09-2018T14:10:10,CrimsonQuill,I forgot! Thanks for the reminder.
08-09-2018T14:10:18,PalmettoPathfinder1,You're welcome!
08-09-2018T14:10:32,CrimsonQuill,Although I was thinking of Matt Smith's version. With a fez.
08-09-2018T14:10:37,CrimsonQuill,Fezzes are cool.
08-09-2018T14:10:47,SpazztasticKiwi,Aladdin
08-09-2018T14:11:01,PalmettoPathfinder1,So Tom is doing the stream tomorrow then.
08-09-2018T14:11:13,SpazztasticKiwi,We‚Äôll see. Chill
08-09-2018T14:11:41,PalmettoPathfinder1,Spazz it's hard to chill when your icon is so cute!
08-09-2018T14:11:55,CrimsonQuill,"I could do with some chill here. It has been raining, but it's a bit humid."
08-09-2018T14:12:07,CrimsonQuill,Bring on the woolly jumper weather!
08-09-2018T14:12:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Gaze into the eyes and fall into its spell
08-09-2018T14:12:27,PalmettoPathfinder1,Must hug it and Spazz!!!!!
08-09-2018T14:12:30,CrimsonQuill,Winter is coming.
08-09-2018T14:12:40,CrimsonQuill,The summer sun is fading as the Year grows old...
08-09-2018T14:12:48,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you‚Äôve ever seen snow leopard cubs, you‚Äôd be near tears"
08-09-2018T14:12:56,CrimsonQuill,I have. I was.
08-09-2018T14:12:56,PalmettoPathfinder1,I have.  :)
08-09-2018T14:13:12,PalmettoPathfinder1,Also George is taking forever with the next book.
08-09-2018T14:13:21,CrimsonQuill,"On the television, only, though."
08-09-2018T14:13:27,CrimsonQuill,"Also, George?"
08-09-2018T14:13:29,SpazztasticKiwi,When they‚Äôre born they instantly bond so when researchers swoop in for tagging to track the species (they‚Äôre critically endangered)...
08-09-2018T14:13:39,PalmettoPathfinder1,George RR Martin
08-09-2018T14:13:44,SpazztasticKiwi,there‚Äôs no danger of abandonment
08-09-2018T14:13:56,PalmettoPathfinder1,That's neat.
08-09-2018T14:14:08,CrimsonQuill,@Spazztastic Kiwi Planet Earth 2 followed a Snow leopard mother and her near-adult cub in episode 2.
08-09-2018T14:14:17,CrimsonQuill,It was heart-wrenching.
08-09-2018T14:14:33,SpazztasticKiwi,"Saw a video of them replacing two cubs in their den, hissing violently at the people"
08-09-2018T14:15:03,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúI may be a bundle of fluff but I aM aNgRy‚Äù
08-09-2018T14:15:05,CrimsonQuill,People in general need to stay away from the big cats.
08-09-2018T14:15:16,CrimsonQuill,Give them a chance to replenish their numbers.
08-09-2018T14:15:24,CrimsonQuill,Deadly elegance...
08-09-2018T14:16:11,PalmettoPathfinder1,There was a news article where a group of lionesses saved a little girl from kidnappers.  Animal experts think the lionesses mistook the girl's crys for a lion cub's crys.
08-09-2018T14:16:18,PalmettoPathfinder1,*cries
08-09-2018T14:16:33,CrimsonQuill,There was an entire documentary called 'Saved by the Lioness'.
08-09-2018T14:16:44,CrimsonQuill,A lioness saved a wildabeest calf from Hyaenas.
08-09-2018T14:16:53,PalmettoPathfinder1,That one too.
08-09-2018T14:16:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Snow leopards are the smallest leopard and one of the smallest wild cats. And they mate so rarely the loss of habitat and hunting is just adding to it
08-09-2018T14:17:01,CrimsonQuill,"It would follow it's real mum on a long journey afterwards,"
08-09-2018T14:17:34,CrimsonQuill,I greatly admire Snow Leopards. I really hope that we can all help them get back on their feet.
08-09-2018T14:17:57,SpazztasticKiwi,Some lions killed a poacher group not too long ago. Problem is they‚Äôre not sure if it was three people or not
08-09-2018T14:18:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Too few body parts found
08-09-2018T14:18:16,CrimsonQuill,Karma.
08-09-2018T14:19:06,SpazztasticKiwi,"They like, we‚Äôre finding shoes and a leg and just bits of equipment"
08-09-2018T14:19:12,SpazztasticKiwi,*were
08-09-2018T14:19:38,CrimsonQuill,It must have been painful. Very painful.
08-09-2018T14:19:43,Xexanoth,did someone say big cats? https://youtu.be/bw7GPNs8x_o?t=116
08-09-2018T14:20:14,CrimsonQuill,"I remember him! Kevin Richardson, 'My Lion Family'!"
08-09-2018T14:20:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"Thing is, a tour group had been by earlier and they believe that‚Äôs when the attack happened cause the group reported the sounds of a lion pride making noise along the lines of hunting/eating"
08-09-2018T14:22:30,SpazztasticKiwi,"They didn‚Äôt investigate cause 1. you don‚Äôt disturb the wildlife, especially if they‚Äôre mid meal or hunt, and 2. they guessed it to be a regular hunt, not humans on the menu"
08-09-2018T14:23:14,Xexanoth,"don't humans count as ""regular hunt"" for lions?"
08-09-2018T14:23:17,Xexanoth,meat is meat after all
08-09-2018T14:23:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Poachers do
08-09-2018T14:23:43,SpazztasticKiwi,But regular people are not food. They‚Äôre friends
08-09-2018T14:24:01,SpazztasticKiwi,...that should keep their distance
08-09-2018T14:24:32,CrimsonQuill,"Yeah. Don't piss them off, and they won't eat you."
08-09-2018T14:24:36,Xexanoth,if we should keep our distnace why are lions so fluffy?
08-09-2018T14:24:41,Xexanoth,*distance
08-09-2018T14:24:50,SpazztasticKiwi,To look sexy for the ladies
08-09-2018T14:25:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Ladies like a fluffy dark mane
08-09-2018T14:25:49,Xexanoth,but all lions are fluffy not just males
08-09-2018T14:26:07,Xexanoth,(also manes are actually pretty coarse due to being for protection)
08-09-2018T14:26:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Maybe the guys like something they can hold too
08-09-2018T14:28:43,SpazztasticKiwi,One story that made me laugh with pettiness is a man tried shooting an armadillo
08-09-2018T14:28:57,CrimsonQuill,Please tell me it didn't work.
08-09-2018T14:29:10,SpazztasticKiwi,Bullet ricocheted off the armor. Wrong bullet caliber
08-09-2018T14:29:20,CrimsonQuill,HAH!
08-09-2018T14:29:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Got himself in the face instead
08-09-2018T14:29:32,MidNightBlue78,I see armadillos ran over on the roads here all the time
08-09-2018T14:29:34,CrimsonQuill,Wait...he shot himself in the face?
08-09-2018T14:29:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Karmadillo
08-09-2018T14:29:49,MidNightBlue78,It ricocheted
08-09-2018T14:30:45,CrimsonQuill,"It's like that scene from iron man-a man tried to shot Tony in the helmet, the bullet ricocheted into his skull."
08-09-2018T14:30:57,SpazztasticKiwi,You need a special bullet strength to shoot through armadillo armor
08-09-2018T14:31:51,MidNightBlue78,"just run them over, it's easier"
08-09-2018T14:32:02,SpazztasticKiwi,Another rather painful story with guns is a guy put is gun in his pants pocket. Safety not on. And accidentally set it off
08-09-2018T14:32:12,SpazztasticKiwi,*his
08-09-2018T14:32:49,SpazztasticKiwi,In the hospital later getting a bullet removed from his...well just guess
08-09-2018T14:33:45,MidNightBlue78,Ouch!!!
08-09-2018T14:34:20,SpazztasticKiwi,Or it may have shot through and they were mainly just stitching him up. Either way it wasn‚Äôt a fun day for him
08-09-2018T14:36:05,PalmettoPathfinder1,Jaguars are able to kill armadillos
08-09-2018T14:37:24,Xexanoth,jaguars are able to kill a lot of things...inlcuding corcodiles(or alligators)
08-09-2018T14:42:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Bite power with specific teeth is different from the power needed to project a bullet of the same power at the same force
08-09-2018T14:42:48,ThingsAreMoving,\o/ Hi everyone!
08-09-2018T14:42:50,ThingsAreMoving,:ctwokinds-nibsbounce:
08-09-2018T14:42:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Yo
08-09-2018T14:43:35,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, stupid thing I saw done on Snapchat was a teen boy picked up a snake and snapped with it in his hand"
08-09-2018T14:43:50,SpazztasticKiwi,What problem do you guys think there was?
08-09-2018T14:44:01,ThingsAreMoving,the snake was venomous?
08-09-2018T14:44:08,SpazztasticKiwi,Baby copperhead
08-09-2018T14:44:22,SpazztasticKiwi,Teen in hospital like two hours later
08-09-2018T14:44:27,ThingsAreMoving,and nothing of any value was lost
08-09-2018T14:44:52,SpazztasticKiwi,I saw the snap I just ‚ÄúDROP IT LIKE ITS HOT!‚Äù
08-09-2018T14:45:08,MidNightBlue78,i hope he learned his lesson
08-09-2018T14:45:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you don‚Äôt know what it is, don‚Äôt go near it"
08-09-2018T14:45:49,SpazztasticKiwi,And definitely don‚Äôt pick it up
08-09-2018T14:46:26,MidNightBlue78,"common sense, which some people seem to lack"
08-09-2018T14:46:33,ThingsAreMoving,well in my country there's only one species of venomous snake
08-09-2018T14:46:50,ThingsAreMoving,and we were taught in school how to recognize it
08-09-2018T14:47:05,ThingsAreMoving,"so yeah, I think the education system failed over there"
08-09-2018T14:47:11,SpazztasticKiwi,We have two in our area. Both have non venomous look alikes
08-09-2018T14:47:47,ThingsAreMoving,well if that's the case then I'd run away from any snake
08-09-2018T14:47:49,SpazztasticKiwi,But the venomous ones have that ‚ÄúI hate life‚Äùlook with the  slanted eyes
08-09-2018T14:47:50,ThingsAreMoving,just to be safe
08-09-2018T14:47:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Don‚Äôt run from snakes around here
08-09-2018T14:48:06,SpazztasticKiwi,We have something called the black racer
08-09-2018T14:48:13,SpazztasticKiwi,They will chase you if you run
08-09-2018T14:48:24,ThingsAreMoving,are snakes faster than humans?
08-09-2018T14:48:35,CrimsonQuill,Some are.
08-09-2018T14:48:40,CrimsonQuill,Take the black Mamba.
08-09-2018T14:48:41,MidNightBlue78,"Here in GA we have water moccasins, pygmy rattlesnakes"
08-09-2018T14:48:42,SpazztasticKiwi,These shits get pretty zoomy
08-09-2018T14:48:52,MidNightBlue78,and I'm not sure what else
08-09-2018T14:48:59,SpazztasticKiwi,Water moccasins are what the racers look like
08-09-2018T14:49:18,SpazztasticKiwi,But the racers often grow longer and have a shinier black back
08-09-2018T14:49:21,TerraTheWizard,meep
08-09-2018T14:49:33,MidNightBlue78,meep meep moop
08-09-2018T14:49:45,ThingsAreMoving,murp
08-09-2018T14:49:58,MidNightBlue78,I wouldn't be able to tell any of them apart
08-09-2018T14:50:04,SpazztasticKiwi,I came across a racer when I was little. Almost picked it up cause it looked like a regular rope
08-09-2018T14:50:08,MidNightBlue78,So i just go the other way
08-09-2018T14:50:09,SpazztasticKiwi,The head moved
08-09-2018T14:50:21,MidNightBlue78,I don't mess with snakes
08-09-2018T14:50:44,SpazztasticKiwi,I aborted mission and backed tf up
08-09-2018T14:51:15,ThingsAreMoving,I think I'd walk around with a cocktail of antivenom in my pocket
08-09-2018T14:51:31,ThingsAreMoving,just in case
08-09-2018T14:51:50,SpazztasticKiwi,It slid away when it saw me
08-09-2018T14:52:02,MidNightBlue78,I would've üí© my bloomers
08-09-2018T14:52:19,SpazztasticKiwi,I‚Äôve also stared down a copperhead
08-09-2018T14:52:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"antivenom has to be made for one particular snake venom, other types you need more then one packet"
08-09-2018T14:52:37,ThingsAreMoving,can't they mix?
08-09-2018T14:52:43,MarvTheHugPharaoh,no
08-09-2018T14:52:48,ThingsAreMoving,well shit
08-09-2018T14:52:50,SpazztasticKiwi,That‚Äôs not how science works
08-09-2018T14:53:03,Tsxxdavid,Hi
08-09-2018T14:53:07,SpazztasticKiwi,Or chemicals I should say

08-09-2018T14:53:38,ThingsAreMoving,"well, some chemicals can coexist in a solution"

08-09-2018T14:54:52,SpazztasticKiwi,It also needs to be kept refrigerated I believe

08-09-2018T14:55:16,ThingsAreMoving,is there some chemical that can stave off my inevitable death long enough for me to get to a hospital?

08-09-2018T14:56:34,ThingsAreMoving,"damn, where are my healing nanites, science guys"
08-09-2018T14:56:45,MarvTheHugPharaoh,sucking it out actually makes it worse

08-09-2018T14:56:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"If you get bit, stay the calmest you can, tie a tourniquet above the bite area between it and the joint where the blood is going to return to the body, and hold the bite below the heart,"
08-09-2018T14:56:53,ThingsAreMoving,"It's 2018, just make them already"
08-09-2018T14:57:24,MidNightBlue78,"Or, just stay indoors"

08-09-2018T14:57:48,MidNightBlue78,unless the snake slithers up your toilet
08-09-2018T14:57:54,SpazztasticKiwi,"Do not cut it open, and do not EVER suck on the area. Those can increase blood flow to the area and spread venom"
08-09-2018T14:58:01,MidNightBlue78,then you're screwed
08-09-2018T14:58:12,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Thats nightmare fuel Midnight, like I love snake but not there"

08-09-2018T15:49:23,Bgrmystr2,all I can say is be very careful where you look
08-09-2018T15:49:26,BadFoMo,"Wait, how did you get that as your furst job?"
08-09-2018T15:49:33,LannAF,not my first job.
08-09-2018T15:49:36,ThingsAreMoving,just don't stand around looking at your phone and you'll be fine
08-09-2018T15:49:36,phil199,hang in and you can do it Lann

08-09-2018T15:49:44,nwroot,fomo no
08-09-2018T15:49:46,Bgrmystr2,cuz the sunlight reflected from panels can be just as bad as staring into the sun directly
08-09-2018T15:49:53,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Give it your all, wish you luck Lann"
08-09-2018T15:49:54,BadFoMo,Oh...
08-09-2018T15:49:55,nwroot,that was 100% intentional
08-09-2018T15:49:57,LannAF,"There's also ""volunteer"" overtime which is basically mandatory OT"
08-09-2018T15:50:05,ThingsAreMoving,huh
08-09-2018T15:50:07,ThingsAreMoving,paid?
08-09-2018T15:50:10,Bgrmystr2,that's not volunteer XD
08-09-2018T15:50:13,LannAF,Of course
08-09-2018T15:50:15,LannAF,Well
08-09-2018T15:50:19,LannAF,You can -not- do it
08-09-2018T15:50:22,Ordithus,"Interesting... I was pretty sure OT was always ""voluntary"""
08-09-2018T15:50:28,Bgrmystr2,"it's supposed to be, Ord"
08-09-2018T15:50:29,Xexanoth,"hmm you know, going by the Flora Mom sketch i assumed the nurse screamed because Raine was fluffy, not because she was getting chocked"
08-09-2018T15:50:31,LannAF,But more than likely you'll eventually get laid off because they want people who are willing to do OT.
08-09-2018T15:50:36,Ordithus,Yeah...
08-09-2018T15:50:37,ThingsAreMoving,some companies are only intrested in flexible workers
08-09-2018T15:50:38,Xexanoth,The more you know
08-09-2018T15:50:39,LannAF,Since they have a strict timeline
08-09-2018T15:50:42,Bgrmystr2,"yeah you can use that against them, Lann"
08-09-2018T15:50:45,LannAF,no
08-09-2018T15:50:47,Ordithus,"Oh god, Mary.  Wow."
08-09-2018T15:50:48,Bgrmystr2,cuz that's not something they're supposed to do
08-09-2018T15:51:02,MallardDuckAvia,I want to somehow see dinosaurs in a sketch
08-09-2018T15:51:13,ThingsAreMoving,wow Mary
08-09-2018T15:51:16,LannAF,If performance doesn't meet requirements they're eligible to lay people off and the union will slot you back into the job books
08-09-2018T15:51:17,Ordithus,"Alas, a single employee making a stand usually gets axed"
08-09-2018T15:51:19,LannAF,That's just how it works there.
08-09-2018T15:51:24,LannAF,It's fine
08-09-2018T15:51:26,ThingsAreMoving,Darth Mary Silverlock
08-09-2018T15:51:26,LannAF,I'm okay with it
08-09-2018T15:51:29,Bgrmystr2,they can't enforce overtime and fire you if you don't do it.
08-09-2018T15:51:30,LannAF,The pay is insane.
08-09-2018T15:51:31,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Mary.... hostile

08-09-2018T15:52:40,Ordithus,I don't doubt Mary can pull this off :D
08-09-2018T15:52:42,LannAF,Hence all the layoffs.
08-09-2018T15:52:53,LannAF,"Lots of people want these jobs, 21+ dollars an hour"
08-09-2018T15:52:55,Bgrmystr2,inflexable doesn't mean forcing overtime on workers. which is the problem xD
08-09-2018T15:52:59,ThingsAreMoving,but they have to communicate what they expect from you before they hire you

08-09-2018T15:53:32,phil199,If the supply for willing workers is big enough you can just do that
08-09-2018T15:53:33,Bgrmystr2,"well okay, but tis what you were implying earlier :c"
08-09-2018T15:53:35,LannAF,It's hard labor. That's all it is.
08-09-2018T15:53:45,BadFoMo,No need to thretin her family!
08-09-2018T15:53:45,DarthKeidran,I imagine it was a hard labor

08-09-2018T15:53:49,LannAF,Not very interesting

08-09-2018T17:08:12,CrRAR,beansiesss?
08-09-2018T17:08:15,DarthKeidran,If it does it again I'm calling my ISP even though I've had difficulties getting it working before.
08-09-2018T17:08:15,JamesBSquirrel3,Aww Maren + Raine:ptv-hearts:
08-09-2018T17:08:15,CrimsonQuill,What is the likelihood of a Halo crossover ever succeeding?
08-09-2018T17:08:28,Ordithus,"Not my suggestions, but this little series makes me feel like I won"

08-09-2018T17:08:56,JamesBSquirrel3,It reminds me looks similar to as Saria + Rose.
08-09-2018T17:09:02,Bgrmystr2,"it would likely have to be a tom pick, Quill"
08-09-2018T17:09:05,CrimsonQuill,"@DarthKeidren D'you think i should try it again, or move on?"
08-09-2018T17:09:15,CrimsonQuill,@DarthKeidran
08-09-2018T17:09:27,Bgrmystr2,cuz the vote will unlikely sway in that direction
08-09-2018T17:09:44,ThingsAreMoving,crossovers aren't that popular over here
08-09-2018T17:09:53,Bgrmystr2,yeah crossovers don't do very well in the polls

08-09-2018T17:11:23,FenceEqualizer,To add to what bgr said people tend to ignore crossover stuff and want to strictly stay in the tk universe
08-09-2018T17:11:25,DarthKeidran,"I'd like to see it tried again, but It should be up to you. I keep trying Sealeen spiking edinmire's water with potions because with the exception of today, it has been historically fairly high up there in the polls."

08-09-2018T17:12:38,phil199,Rains not very amused about that
08-09-2018T17:12:42,Ordithus,I wonder if she's more comfortable in her human form
08-09-2018T17:12:46,Bgrmystr2,clearly raine can see the 4th wall
08-09-2018T17:12:52,Bgrmystr2,tis the only reason she hides
08-09-2018T17:12:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I can understand where‚Äôs she‚Äôs coming from. It‚Äôs only funny cause they‚Äôre technically fictional
08-09-2018T17:12:53,FenceEqualizer,Maren is sick of your modesty
08-09-2018T17:13:01,Bgrmystr2,ikr Fence

08-09-2018T17:13:44,DarthKeidran,Definitely Natani
08-09-2018T17:13:48,Twokinds,Apparently it's a movie

08-09-2018T17:13:55,Twokinds,I'm not surprised
08-09-2018T17:13:57,CrimsonQuill,"Although, He's more 'smooth' than 'Sexy'"

08-09-2018T17:14:05,CrRAR,sexy... but effective?
08-09-2018T17:14:06,MarvTheHugPharaoh,whats its IMDB rating Tom?

08-09-2018T17:14:12,BadFoMo,*sexyness
08-09-2018T17:14:17,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds is this the pick then
08-09-2018T17:14:20,Bgrmystr2,"assassins would use sex urges as a weapon, it's actually a real thing"
08-09-2018T17:14:22,CrimsonQuill,Sexy assassin
08-09-2018T17:14:25,Twokinds,Oh there's some interesting ridiculous assassin's creed designs
08-09-2018T17:14:30,DarthKeidran,I'd imagine the thought process was probably something along the lines of Black widow (Marvel)
08-09-2018T17:14:32,Zuke,a sexy assasin is most of my modded skyrim characters tbh
08-09-2018T17:14:33,FenceEqualizer,What bgr said
08-09-2018T17:14:38,JamesBSquirrel3,It doesn't look like it to me.
08-09-2018T17:14:39,RimaDraws,what about kill bill
08-09-2018T17:14:41,DarthKeidran,that's just a guess though
08-09-2018T17:14:44,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúInteresting ridiculous‚Äù?
08-09-2018T17:14:45,Twokinds,I could use one of them
08-09-2018T17:14:50,CrimsonQuill,I have Discworld Assassin's guild on the brain
08-09-2018T17:14:52,RimaDraws,that blonde in the yellow jumpsuit
08-09-2018T17:14:56,CrimsonQuill,They only wear black
08-09-2018T17:15:04,FenceEqualizer,Hey Assassin creed is awesome :( even if it's shoveled all the time

08-09-2018T17:15:09,RimaDraws,yes
08-09-2018T17:15:13,RimaDraws,uma thurman
08-09-2018T17:15:13,Bgrmystr2,female assassins can use their body to get close to men to kill them. it's a viable tactic and works very well
08-09-2018T17:15:16,CrRAR,She would make quite a protege.
08-09-2018T17:15:17,phil199,now I¬¥m curious what ridicules AC designs are
08-09-2018T17:15:20,Bgrmystr2,so.. yeah
08-09-2018T17:15:21,Twokinds,Intriguingly impractical

08-09-2018T17:45:23,CrimsonQuill,This looks really cool.
08-09-2018T17:45:31,Xexanoth,@ProsePro7 so according to the wiki she jsut bends her finger back
08-09-2018T17:45:41,ProsePro7,...OW!

08-09-2018T17:45:45,CrimsonQuill,@Twokinds What'll you and Mark be doing in Korea?
08-09-2018T17:45:49,ProsePro7,WHY?
08-09-2018T17:46:08,Bgrmystr2,"visiting family, quill"
08-09-2018T17:46:09,Bgrmystr2,probably
08-09-2018T17:46:10,Xexanoth,to signal she was with the assassins
08-09-2018T17:46:19,HobbitGames,"Well, i would put money on them eating AT LEAST twice"
08-09-2018T17:46:37,Xexanoth,while they don't loose their fingers anymore they still do it ceremonialy and it's a symbol for them
08-09-2018T17:46:38,ProsePro7,Okay that is really just...
08-09-2018T17:46:43,ThingsAreMoving,Are those sewing needles?
08-09-2018T17:46:47,ThingsAreMoving,and thread?
08-09-2018T17:46:52,DarthKeidran,All she needs is Attack On Titan 3D-Mobility Gear and she'll be a better assassin than Natani or Zen would ever be.
08-09-2018T17:46:56,Xexanoth,after all the whole point of NOT loosing the finger is that people can't tell you're an assassin
08-09-2018T17:46:59,HobbitGames,Ha
08-09-2018T17:47:00,Bgrmystr2,maybe things

08-09-2018T17:47:13,Bgrmystr2,she could sew like a boss
08-09-2018T17:47:21,Ordithus,"""I'll kill you with my teacup"""
08-09-2018T17:47:22,ThingsAreMoving,she'll sew all your orfices shut and then you suffocate and die
08-09-2018T17:47:34,Bgrmystr2,I.. don't think  she'd do that
08-09-2018T17:47:39,ProsePro7,Like Billy from Hocus Pocus

08-09-2018T17:50:24,DarthKeidran,"In retrospect. As long as those threads are the strength of spider's silk, and provided she can throw them hard enough, all Kat needs is the high powered spool from the Attack On Titan 3D-MG to pull it back in and she'd be best assassin there never was."
08-09-2018T17:50:34,ThingsAreMoving,...that's a tight bra

08-09-2018T20:27:38,Twokinds,They don't even seem to know what causes them exactly
08-09-2018T20:28:28,Ordithus,Just have to let them heal?
08-09-2018T20:29:33,SpazztasticKiwi,Aw. Figured you‚Äôd look good with a tongue stud
08-09-2018T20:29:40,TorqueEmUp,Just bacteria/viruses

08-09-2018T20:33:41,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, doctors will go from most common ailments with your symptoms down to the the least common. Which sucks if you have something super rare, it will take forever for it to be figured out."
08-09-2018T20:33:55,Ordithus,usually works better that way
08-09-2018T20:34:01,TorqueEmUp,well of course
08-09-2018T20:34:08,Bgrmystr2,Don't be afraid Tom. It's just cancer - WebMD probably
08-09-2018T20:34:31,FenceEqualizer,Not sure why people use webmd sometimes XD
08-09-2018T20:34:38,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, just don't"
08-09-2018T20:34:38,Ordithus,"Funny how in college the diagnosis went from constipation, to appendicitis, to intestinal torsion :upside_down:"
08-09-2018T20:34:46,TorqueEmUp,You will scare yourself more than anything
08-09-2018T20:34:48,Bgrmystr2,because if you actually bother to look through and READ everything
08-09-2018T20:34:53,Bgrmystr2,it's actually more accurate
08-09-2018T20:34:59,Bgrmystr2,if you just read the first thing that pops up
08-09-2018T20:35:04,Bgrmystr2,then yeah no shit it's gonna be inaccurate
08-09-2018T20:35:13,Bgrmystr2,but most ppl don't bother reading everything
08-09-2018T20:35:26,FenceEqualizer,I can believe it.
08-09-2018T20:35:27,SpazztasticKiwi,It can be like ‚ÄúPain near inner thigh? Testicular cancer‚Äù ‚Äúbut I don‚Äôt even have testiculars‚Äù
08-09-2018T20:35:44,TorqueEmUp,"Also the brain likes to give you false symptoms if you ""think"" something is wrong"
08-09-2018T20:35:57,Bgrmystr2,"the site sn't smart. and yeah exactly, Torque"
08-09-2018T20:35:57,FenceEqualizer,"""I have a cough"" you have lung cancer"
08-09-2018T20:36:16,Bgrmystr2,so what you think are symptoms could be something else entirely
08-09-2018T20:36:27,FenceEqualizer,That's always fun
08-09-2018T20:36:37,SpazztasticKiwi,It‚Äôs more of a suggestions thing than I diagnostic tool
08-09-2018T20:36:52,SpazztasticKiwi,*a
08-09-2018T20:37:00,Bgrmystr2,"self-diagnosis is terribly inaccurate to begin with, then put that to a website that cannot read your mind nor smart enough to know what symptoms you actually have.."
08-09-2018T20:37:05,TorqueEmUp,"Yeah, but cancer should be shoved to the bottom, not near the top to scare people. :P"
08-09-2018T20:37:07,Bgrmystr2,and it's a failing combo
08-09-2018T20:37:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Or run tests
08-09-2018T20:37:19,SpazztasticKiwi,Or look at the area in question
08-09-2018T20:37:29,Bgrmystr2,it's just that there's so many types of cancer out there XD
08-09-2018T20:37:33,Ordithus,Self-reporting of symptoms is a huge hindrance to real doctors too
08-09-2018T20:37:42,Ordithus,How honest are patients...
08-09-2018T20:37:49,Bgrmystr2,yeah ord
08-09-2018T20:37:53,Ordithus,"Often, not very at all"
08-09-2018T20:38:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Like this one girl and her mother I overheard once

08-09-2018T20:48:36,TorqueEmUp,Sadly I do remember girls being pregnant as young as middle school.
08-09-2018T20:48:38,SpazztasticKiwi,"I think the problem was she ran out of pills and didn‚Äôt tell mom, then maybe hasn‚Äôt mentioned she fooled with boyfriend"
08-09-2018T20:49:21,TorqueEmUp,remember them in high school too
08-09-2018T20:49:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Or neither understands that taking them has to be consistent and constant or you get baby
08-09-2018T20:49:32,CrRAR,&gt; doesn't want a baby
08-09-2018T20:49:36,CrRAR,&gt; does a thing to have baby
08-09-2018T20:49:40,CrRAR,can't explain it
08-09-2018T20:49:41,TorqueEmUp,I was the result of a missed pill

08-09-2018T20:50:06,SpazztasticKiwi,Or figured she couldn‚Äôt get pregnant cause maybe the medication was still in her system enough to prevent it
08-09-2018T20:50:11,Bgrmystr2,"she's one of the ppl on yahoo.. ""If take pills, How get gregnant?"""
08-09-2018T20:51:06,CrRAR,lol
08-09-2018T20:52:03,SpazztasticKiwi,I went to school with a guy that thought taking a bunch of pills at once would abort a baby
08-09-2018T20:52:11,TorqueEmUp,My mother had me at 25. :p
08-09-2018T20:52:30,Ordithus,That's pretty normal
08-09-2018T20:52:49,TorqueEmUp,"Yep, probably around the ideal age honestly"

08-09-2018T20:53:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Stupidity
08-09-2018T20:53:32,SpazztasticKiwi,In most cases
08-09-2018T20:54:04,TorqueEmUp,"Stupidity, letting their hormones dictate things instead of their brain"

08-09-2018T20:54:49,SpazztasticKiwi,"Let me run something by y‚Äôall tho. He was talking about getting her to take a mass of pills cause evidently after one night together, he saw the pill box was near full (she‚Äôd been missing days)"
08-09-2018T20:55:05,SpazztasticKiwi,To me that sounds like she maybe wanted to get pregnant
08-09-2018T20:55:14,SpazztasticKiwi,Or was just really stupid
08-09-2018T20:55:24,TorqueEmUp,"But then you have the idiots that are like ""condom sex sucks"" Still even if shes on the pill, wrap the damn thing man."
08-09-2018T20:56:05,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúCondoms aren‚Äôt comfortable‚Äù ‚ÄúNeither is childbirth‚Äù
08-09-2018T20:56:37,TorqueEmUp,"Also 20+ years of supporting a son or daughter, and never ever having a restful night sleep again."
08-09-2018T20:56:47,Bgrmystr2,"fairly sure condoms are much less of a problem on the ""uncomfortable"" scale"
08-09-2018T20:57:26,TorqueEmUp,"Nah, infact they are far from in all honesty"
08-09-2018T20:57:59,Bgrmystr2,you don't FEEL EVERYTHING which.. okay.
08-09-2018T20:57:59,SpazztasticKiwi,"The day we watched the childbirth video in sex ed, I saw about 12 guys‚Äô faces in synchronized horror"
08-09-2018T20:58:24,TorqueEmUp,lol
08-09-2018T20:58:32,Bgrmystr2,well yeah that's not surprisng
08-09-2018T20:59:07,TorqueEmUp,Was it on laser disc?
08-09-2018T20:59:09,TorqueEmUp,lol
08-09-2018T20:59:22,SpazztasticKiwi,You mean a DVD
08-09-2018T20:59:28,TorqueEmUp,Nope
08-09-2018T20:59:49,TorqueEmUp,My sex ed class used laser discs for these videos. lol
08-09-2018T21:00:00,SpazztasticKiwi,dumb it down a bit
08-09-2018T21:00:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Laser disc lesson...?
08-09-2018T21:00:18,TorqueEmUp,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaserDisc
08-09-2018T21:00:25,TorqueEmUp,It's a video format
08-09-2018T21:00:25,Bgrmystr2,beat me to it
08-09-2018T21:01:18,SpazztasticKiwi,Nah. It was just a medical video
08-09-2018T21:01:40,SpazztasticKiwi,On the projector
08-09-2018T21:01:43,Bgrmystr2,the question is.. can you put more than just video/audio on LD?
08-09-2018T21:02:27,Bgrmystr2,it's fundamentally the same as a cd.. laser writing data to a disk
08-09-2018T21:03:04,Bgrmystr2,so I'd think theoretically you could put more than just video and audio on em
08-09-2018T21:03:07,SpazztasticKiwi,We even saw afterbirth delivery. Fun
08-09-2018T21:03:20,TorqueEmUp,"Probably, but what's the point in that?"
08-09-2018T21:03:24,Ordithus,The wonders of child birth
08-09-2018T21:03:48,SpazztasticKiwi,Wonder of why more people don‚Äôt wrap it up
08-09-2018T21:03:50,TorqueEmUp,*ace ventura voice* Yummeh
08-09-2018T21:03:59,CrRAR,haha
08-09-2018T21:04:40,Bgrmystr2,"honestly, Torque, if people had asked the same question back when LaserDisks were the only things that existed"
08-09-2018T21:04:48,Bgrmystr2,"we wouldn't have CDs, DVDs, or Blurays"
08-09-2018T21:05:49,Bgrmystr2,"from what I'm reading, it's more likely that the software / hardware used to write onto Laserdisk was only for video or audio"
08-09-2018T21:05:53,TorqueEmUp,"Indeed, because LD was on the market before CD."
08-09-2018T21:06:04,TorqueEmUp,"78, while CD was 82."
08-09-2018T21:06:17,CrRAR,"Yeah, a quick read says that LD was encoded in analog."
08-09-2018T21:06:53,Bgrmystr2,so.. I'm presuming that you could theoretically take a laserdisk.. disk.. and make something that writes data to that disk
08-09-2018T21:06:58,SpazztasticKiwi,üíøüíæüìÄ üìº
08-09-2018T21:07:01,Bgrmystr2,and it would probably work
08-09-2018T21:07:07,Bgrmystr2,"not a LOT of data, but"
08-09-2018T21:07:09,Bgrmystr2,data nonetheless
08-09-2018T21:07:29,TorqueEmUp,Wholly pointless these days with 50GB+ Bluray discs
08-09-2018T21:08:16,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, I dunno. It works as a proof of concept that you can use something outside of it's intended use and make it more versatile"
08-09-2018T21:08:48,Bgrmystr2,"it's not about how much you store on it, but the ability to actually use the disk to store more than what it's intended to."
08-09-2018T21:09:44,CrRAR,Could function pretty good as a frisbee these days.
08-09-2018T21:09:48,Bgrmystr2,"it probably was actually taken and explored to some effect, as we do have disks based off LaserDisk that are storage devices rather than just media storage"
08-09-2018T21:09:54,Bgrmystr2,haha Cr
08-09-2018T21:10:04,Bgrmystr2,Doesn't have the lift though
08-09-2018T21:10:06,TorqueEmUp,"That's a lot of engineering work to build the recorders, and press the writeable discs."
08-09-2018T21:10:10,SpazztasticKiwi,‚ÄúHere‚Äôs your damn files!‚Äù
08-09-2018T21:10:25,TorqueEmUp,It'd be neat though
08-09-2018T21:10:37,TorqueEmUp,having record sized blurays or something.
08-09-2018T21:10:54,Bgrmystr2,yeah Torque. Technology doesn't move forward without working towards something that hasn't been done before xD
08-09-2018T21:11:12,TorqueEmUp,"But ultimately would only work as proof of concept, it's hard enough getting people to buy movies and games on discs anymore."
08-09-2018T21:11:12,Bgrmystr2,"""Why would you do that?"" Because science!"
08-09-2018T21:11:29,Bgrmystr2,"yeah that'd be it's only purpose, proof of concept."
08-09-2018T21:11:39,TorqueEmUp,Which is sad because that's why I don't PC game much. I want the disc.
08-09-2018T21:11:55,Bgrmystr2,I haven't had a working disk tray in so many years..
08-09-2018T21:12:19,Bgrmystr2,yet I have a cd rack behind me with like 150+ games
08-09-2018T21:12:29,TorqueEmUp,Honestly I'd probably go PC if they released PC games on Bluray.
08-09-2018T21:12:49,TorqueEmUp,"by go PC, I mean PC game more."
08-09-2018T21:13:21,Bgrmystr2,"I don't really care what they release it on, but I do rather like digital installs without needing a CD. Not like.. installs from steam or whatever"
08-09-2018T21:13:36,Bgrmystr2,"but just.. take the installer itself, and install it to pc, no internet needed"
08-09-2018T21:13:43,Bgrmystr2,and no cd required
08-09-2018T21:14:02,Bgrmystr2,I'd be able to burn it to a cd or move another drive for backup
08-09-2018T21:14:11,Bgrmystr2,"but otherwise, just the installer is fine"
08-09-2018T21:14:25,Bgrmystr2,and that's what old cds did.. they just stored information.. no DRM bullshit
08-09-2018T21:14:39,Bgrmystr2,good days.. &lt;3

08-09-2018T21:41:25,Ordithus,"As far as I'm aware, no version since the original is really what the original was"
08-09-2018T21:42:13,Ordithus,But based upon the GBA sorta remake
08-09-2018T21:43:06,Twokinds,But I like the GBA one...
08-09-2018T21:43:29,Dadrobit,"Honestly, the GBA one and the DS sequel were pretty alright."
08-09-2018T21:43:52,Dadrobit,The Judge system was shit though.

08-09-2018T21:44:31,Dadrobit,"I mean, FFT on PSN is exactly the same as the PS1 disk."
08-09-2018T21:45:08,Dadrobit,"War of the Lions Edition was the one where they changed it a bit (better dialogue, cutscenes) for the PSP."

08-09-2018T21:46:15,Dadrobit,I don't think Tactics is available on PS4

08-09-2018T22:07:04,TorqueEmUp,Same with Cyberpunk?
