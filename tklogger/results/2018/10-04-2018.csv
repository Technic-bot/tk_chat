10-04-2018T00:04:52,Bgrmystr2,"yknow, I'm tempted to ask Karen's hair in yellow"
10-04-2018T00:05:01,Bgrmystr2,but I already know who she'd look like.
10-04-2018T00:05:36,qwe304,want me to do it?
10-04-2018T00:05:49,Bgrmystr2,eh. Up to you. xD
10-04-2018T00:06:36,Vatruvius,Anyone give Dreadnought a try?

10-04-2018T00:11:33,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-laugh: that looks so bad
10-04-2018T00:11:52,Bgrmystr2,Natani is Ash-colored
10-04-2018T00:12:16,Vatruvius,Keith's ears should be the body colored but Natani looks alright...maybe that is because I have seen a Basitin Natani so...
10-04-2018T00:12:28,qwe304,yellow next
10-04-2018T00:12:31,Vatruvius,Natani really does not look that bad...but Keith however.
10-04-2018T00:16:43,qwe304,yellow karen https://imgur.com/a/R7wTS
10-04-2018T00:17:33,Vatruvius,Not bad.
10-04-2018T00:18:05,Vatruvius,I am so close!
10-04-2018T00:18:09,Vatruvius,:ptv-excited:
10-04-2018T00:18:18,NightMeaty22,she went super saiyan
10-04-2018T00:18:57,Bgrmystr2,"ayyy, it's Su"
10-04-2018T00:19:55,qwe304,any other i should do?
10-04-2018T00:20:12,Vatruvius,Do all of them.
10-04-2018T00:20:46,qwe304,which first
10-04-2018T00:20:55,Vatruvius,Rose and Natani
10-04-2018T00:21:03,qwe304,mhh...
10-04-2018T00:21:19,Vatruvius,I said all...I really am just throwing ideas out there.
10-04-2018T00:21:27,Bgrmystr2,http://lovehina.wikia.com/wiki/Kaolla_Su#Anime Probably one of my favorite classic characters.. and the fact that Karen was based off her is great too :v
10-04-2018T00:22:10,Vatruvius,Was Karen based off of her?
10-04-2018T00:22:16,Bgrmystr2,Yes
10-04-2018T00:22:20,Bgrmystr2,She was.
10-04-2018T00:23:06,Vatruvius,Another other TK characters that were based off other characters?
10-04-2018T00:23:12,Bgrmystr2,dunno
10-04-2018T00:23:21,Bgrmystr2,I know that one cuz Tom said so in the stream chat one day
10-04-2018T00:23:48,Vatruvius,But Karen certainly has evolved into her own character though.
10-04-2018T00:23:52,NightMeaty22,well i'm gunna go cya
10-04-2018T00:24:03,Vatruvius,Goodnight!
10-04-2018T00:24:24,NightMeaty22,not that i was really here any way
10-04-2018T00:25:33,Dadrobit,"Qwe, looking at your question earlier about the online update, some things might be changed like the chapter title pages, but otherwise whenever books are changed the rest of the comic stays more or less the same. The books traditionally have some diffs."
10-04-2018T00:25:38,Dadrobit,o/ Meaty
10-04-2018T00:25:58,Bgrmystr2,"Karen was never going to be Su to begin with though, Vatru. She was always going to be her own character."
10-04-2018T00:26:07,Bgrmystr2,and was so from the beginning xD
10-04-2018T00:26:40,Dadrobit,"Of course, I'm not Tom, so really, heck if I know exactly how things are gonna turn out."
10-04-2018T00:26:47,Vatruvius,I see...Karen was based off of some principles of Su.
10-04-2018T00:26:55,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, she was"
10-04-2018T00:27:09,Bgrmystr2,"short hair genki girl, basically"
10-04-2018T00:27:10,Vatruvius,Like the careless/upbeat view of the world?
10-04-2018T00:27:30,Bgrmystr2,"hmm, I dunno about that one"
10-04-2018T00:27:48,Vatruvius,Oh...
10-04-2018T00:28:35,Bgrmystr2,kinda like the scene where trace was fighting neutral and karen was watching in like.. a chair relaxing like it was a movie or w/e
10-04-2018T00:29:05,Vatruvius,That was awesome...
10-04-2018T00:29:13,Bgrmystr2,or the time where trace was in bed w/ flora and she had fallen asleep
10-04-2018T00:29:14,Vatruvius,I finally got my sister into the comic I think.
10-04-2018T00:29:18,Vatruvius,Took long enough.
10-04-2018T00:29:32,Bgrmystr2,and she was like 'go trace!' when everyone else was mad or confused
10-04-2018T00:29:37,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, shit like that"
10-04-2018T00:29:38,Vatruvius,lol
10-04-2018T00:30:38,Vatruvius,I told my sister I would stop bugging her about the comic if she read up to Chapter 3...if she did not like it I would leave her alone. Just last Sunday I asked if she read it Chapter 2 yet and she said she read all the way through Chapter 4.
10-04-2018T00:30:42,Bgrmystr2,"http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/69/ this page, specifically lol"
10-04-2018T00:30:46,Vatruvius,Mission accomplished.
10-04-2018T00:31:00,Vatruvius,I like the page number.
10-04-2018T00:31:10,Bgrmystr2,yeh tom's got jokes lol
10-04-2018T00:31:20,Vatruvius,I figured that was planned.
10-04-2018T00:31:44,Bgrmystr2,the page after that she jumped on keith's back
10-04-2018T00:31:46,Bgrmystr2,xD
10-04-2018T00:32:37,Vatruvius,Oh...and Red was like...fight for fighting's sake or something and was attacking Tom
10-04-2018T00:34:09,Bgrmystr2,Ayyyy I found it :D http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/171/
10-04-2018T00:34:23,Bgrmystr2,"chair, popcorn"
10-04-2018T00:35:02,Vatruvius,"I like how she is saying ""this took too long to set up; fight, fight, fight!"""
10-04-2018T00:35:14,Bgrmystr2,haha
10-04-2018T00:35:14,Bgrmystr2,right?
10-04-2018T00:38:00,Vatruvius,Hmm...that gave me a sketch idea.
10-04-2018T00:38:35,TheBeckoner,Hullo people
10-04-2018T00:38:38,Vatruvius,Karen inspired fighting...or Karen pouring fuel on a situation because she wants to watch it.
10-04-2018T00:38:42,Vatruvius,Hey Beck.
10-04-2018T00:38:55,TheBeckoner,How's it goin?
10-04-2018T00:38:59,Vatruvius,Not bad.
10-04-2018T00:40:44,TheBeckoner,That's good then. Just saw that the Alaric v Madelyn piece got sketched. good stuff. Alaric is best.
10-04-2018T00:40:45,Vatruvius,Alright...I cannot take it anymore no matter how close I am.
10-04-2018T00:41:00,Vatruvius,lol...in that sketch Maddie is best.
10-04-2018T00:41:08,TheBeckoner,Close to what Vat?
10-04-2018T00:41:16,TheBeckoner,Well sure in the fight
10-04-2018T00:41:17,TheBeckoner,but
10-04-2018T00:41:20,TheBeckoner,Alaric is best
10-04-2018T00:42:08,Vatruvius,My youtube view history was all messed up and was giving all these horrible suggestions so I delete my history and went back and watch some of the best videos/playlists of my favorite youtubers in order of upload date.
10-04-2018T00:42:25,Vatruvius,Literally 1400 videos. I added them all into one playlist.
10-04-2018T00:42:38,Vatruvius,I am not on video 1192 or something.
10-04-2018T00:42:46,Vatruvius,now*
10-04-2018T00:43:11,TheBeckoner,hah wow
10-04-2018T00:43:17,TheBeckoner,Is it working?
10-04-2018T00:43:53,Vatruvius,Yup...best video suggestions ever. Also...by doing that I saw a lot of Mark's older videos which lead me here. :D
10-04-2018T00:44:04,Vatruvius,Had I never done that I would never have discovered Twokinds.
10-04-2018T00:44:10,Vatruvius,*gasp*
10-04-2018T00:45:30,TheBeckoner,Yeah. I think I found Twokinds on Ifunny
10-04-2018T00:45:38,TheBeckoner,years back
10-04-2018T00:45:45,Vatruvius,Hmm...
10-04-2018T00:46:47,TheBeckoner,"Like when the app first came out I think, some dude was posting the comic pages. When subscribing happened on the app I got pretty hooked on the comic"
10-04-2018T00:46:48,Vatruvius,"Probably one of the hardest things about recommending the comic for me is it is hard to avoid the conversations of ""are you a furry?"""
10-04-2018T00:47:01,TheBeckoner,yeah
10-04-2018T00:47:10,Nillalee113,Oh but embrace the furry
10-04-2018T00:47:12,TheBeckoner,really good content...just too much for some people
10-04-2018T00:47:41,Vatruvius,Like...does it look like I enjoy the comic...OF COURSE I AM A FURRY! :ptv-angry:
10-04-2018T00:48:23,Vatruvius,It is really weird when your younger sister asks you though...had to dodge that one. Luckily my parents are not internet people so they have no idea what a furry is.
10-04-2018T00:48:25,TheBeckoner,"Ha. I wouldnt really consider myself a furry...Idk what makes you one aside from self proclamation, but Im not doin that"
10-04-2018T00:48:40,TheBeckoner,lol
10-04-2018T00:48:51,TheBeckoner,Imagine the explanation to them
10-04-2018T00:49:08,TheBeckoner,"""Basically werewolfs dad"""
10-04-2018T00:49:15,Vatruvius,God no!
10-04-2018T00:49:19,TheBeckoner,lol
10-04-2018T00:49:27,TheBeckoner,gottta make it easy for them
10-04-2018T00:49:40,Vatruvius,They think in terms of bestiality...like one is attracted to wild animals.
10-04-2018T00:50:25,Vatruvius,"I am not sure about you...but Flora, Natani, Keith, etc. do not look like animals at all."
10-04-2018T00:52:19,Vatruvius,:ptv-confused:...chat went quiet.
10-04-2018T00:52:58,Dadrobit,"That's what furries do, they kill the chat."
10-04-2018T00:53:20,Vatruvius,Wha...:ptv-wondering:
10-04-2018T00:53:56,Dadrobit,"Also, I'm super glad MvA it got sketched as well. I missed the actual sketching of it, but it came out amazeballs."
10-04-2018T00:54:39,Vatruvius,It is pretty good. I wanted Maddie to be running around dodging Alaric and booping him.
10-04-2018T00:54:47,Vatruvius,But it is still awesome.
10-04-2018T00:54:59,TheBeckoner,Im happy with anything Alaric. +1 from me Robit
10-04-2018T00:55:14,TheBeckoner,Maddie is neat too
10-04-2018T00:55:15,Dadrobit,\o/
10-04-2018T00:55:30,Vatruvius,Frankenstein Alaric?
10-04-2018T00:55:49,Dadrobit,Already did Thriller Zombie Alaric if that counts
10-04-2018T00:56:16,Vatruvius,Nah...like Alaric brought back to life by mad scientist type stuff.
10-04-2018T00:56:55,Dadrobit,"Traditionally, bringing Alaric back from the dead has not been well received by the community lol!"
10-04-2018T00:57:17,Vatruvius,They want to keep him that way.
10-04-2018T00:57:33,Dadrobit,I presume you know the incident I'm talking about?
10-04-2018T00:57:50,Vatruvius,If it was more than 3-4 weeks ago then no.
10-04-2018T00:57:58,TheBeckoner,I am also not aware
10-04-2018T00:58:01,TheBeckoner,I dont think
10-04-2018T00:58:11,Vatruvius,I came on when Tom drew the Alaric Jumps sketch.
10-04-2018T00:59:12,Dadrobit,Tom did an April Fools day comic that spanned about a week where Alaric was brought back to life by sharing in the body of Lynn. Some of the members freaked the hell out and the backlash Tom got from it made him swear off of doing another April Fool's Day
10-04-2018T00:59:18,Dadrobit,Comic ever again.
10-04-2018T00:59:48,Dadrobit,"Luckily, he eventually got over it and started making them again a few years later."
10-04-2018T01:00:10,Vatruvius,I saw those colors...I thought they were awesome...not the best but really cool.
10-04-2018T01:00:34,Vatruvius,There are a lot of things the majority of the community loves/hates that I do not get.
10-04-2018T01:00:38,Dadrobit,Colors?
10-04-2018T01:01:15,TheBeckoner,Ohhh yeah I remember that Robit.
10-04-2018T01:01:16,Vatruvius,They were put under the colors category on patreon. Also...since they are just one page I call them colors.
10-04-2018T01:01:55,TheBeckoner,At the time I had no clue about the streams so I thought it was part of the main story line lol freaked me out. I was ok with it tho
10-04-2018T01:02:27,Dadrobit,"Nonono, this was waaaay before Patreon."
10-04-2018T01:02:47,Vatruvius,Ohh...that one April Fool's comic page where Raine tells the story about Rose having a red haired keidran...
10-04-2018T01:03:07,Dadrobit,"Hold on, I'll get it..."
10-04-2018T01:03:08,Vatruvius,Hmm...I saw them somewhere. Either on patreon or deviant.
10-04-2018T01:04:18,Dadrobit,https://orig00.deviantart.net/ee94/f/2014/098/2/d/the_entire_april_fools_saga_2014_by_twokinds-d7dm2gb.jpg
10-04-2018T01:04:25,TheBeckoner,I think the dude who used to post TK on ifunny posted it when I saw it
10-04-2018T01:07:25,Dadrobit,Part of the issue was that he put out a paragraph at the top of the website trying to explain it as being legitimate for about a week while he uploaded the three pages individually.
10-04-2018T01:08:31,TheBeckoner,Its all good to me up till alabaster. I never did see the paragraph
10-04-2018T01:08:34,Vatruvius,No one took a grain of salt with it being near April Fools?
10-04-2018T01:09:46,TheBeckoner,I dont think I saw it on april fools. I also dont think I ever saw the april fools portion of it.
10-04-2018T01:09:53,TheBeckoner,er
10-04-2018T01:10:04,TheBeckoner,"the part that straight up says ""april fools"""
10-04-2018T01:12:11,SpazztasticKiwi,Tom should be able to do whatever he pleases with the comic - it is entirely his after all in the end
10-04-2018T01:13:10,SpazztasticKiwi,April Fools things are supposed to be rib-pokers - it’s what makes em fun
10-04-2018T01:14:00,Vatruvius,"I assume handling internet fame is difficult, I would not want my chat/messages/comments to be filled with hate and spend a large portion of my time banning people. Though the majority of people on the internet are ass hats."
10-04-2018T01:16:06,SpazztasticKiwi,We’ve seen a bit of it that Tom gets from the copy/paste trolls
10-04-2018T01:16:40,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though that’s just a tiny bit of the surface of what he has to juggle, I’m sure"
10-04-2018T01:17:14,Dadrobit,"Hmmm, taking too long to find the paragraph, but the gist of the argument against what he did centers around what he did when it was NOT April Fool's Day."
10-04-2018T01:17:32,Dadrobit,"He continued updating the ""arc"" for a week beyond it."
10-04-2018T01:18:11,Dadrobit,"And he wrote up explanations citing ""hints"" that he had planted long in the past like showing in the court room that Lynn had a grey eye like Alaric."
10-04-2018T01:18:19,Vatruvius,What...they think a well laid out comic prank can be done in a single day? I feel like the pop in only when a stream notification pops up or a new page pops up...nothing more.
10-04-2018T01:18:41,Vatruvius,they pop in*
10-04-2018T01:19:10,Dadrobit,"It's a trust thing. When someone pranks you on AFD and you get told it's just a prank right then and there, it's whatever, good fun."
10-04-2018T01:19:53,Dadrobit,"But when you continue telling people a week later that, ""nope, it's for real, here's evidence that I've been planning this for a long time,"" you break that trust."
10-04-2018T01:19:54,Vatruvius,From my time on the internet...there are a lot of assholes who want only what they want on the internet.
10-04-2018T01:20:25,Vatruvius,I do not know...I still would have taken a grain of salt from it all.
10-04-2018T01:20:55,Dadrobit,"Most people took it in stride, but there were some very vocal people upset about it. I know he lost some readership from it."
10-04-2018T01:21:45,Vatruvius,Dudging by that fact the comic established that Laura was just a projection and not her spirit...along with april fools nearby and a weird story that seems to be spending too much time on one moment.
10-04-2018T01:21:51,Dadrobit,"One of the going speculations is that he really was planning on bringing Alaric back and was using AFD as a cover if the backlash was too much, which it turned out to be."
10-04-2018T01:22:54,Vatruvius,Backlash was big...but weather Tom was using it as a cover I guess we will never know. I honestly do not care...it is Tom's work and he can do what he wants with it. Hell...I love TV shows that kill my favorite characters so...
10-04-2018T01:22:58,Dadrobit,"You should try out the forums, trust me, the years spent on the boat have already been well bemoaned a million times over."
10-04-2018T01:23:28,Vatruvius,The forums? Bemoaned?
10-04-2018T01:23:47,TheBeckoner,sorrow I believe
10-04-2018T01:23:50,Dadrobit,The forums: https://www.twokinds.net/forum/index.php
10-04-2018T01:24:13,Dadrobit,Bemoaned: expressing discontent or sorrow over something
10-04-2018T01:24:27,TheBeckoner,was pretty close
10-04-2018T01:24:55,SpazztasticKiwi,"Stories that kill your favorite/main characters, you say? Did you mean “basically anything written by John Green”?"
10-04-2018T01:25:16,Vatruvius,We are not going there Kiwi! Just...do not!
10-04-2018T01:25:37,Vatruvius,"mumbles ""piece of shit Green."""
10-04-2018T01:26:02,SpazztasticKiwi,"The Fault in Our Stars, man"
10-04-2018T01:26:12,SpazztasticKiwi,Nothing is sacred
10-04-2018T01:26:45,Vatruvius,lost his mind thanks to Kiwi.
10-04-2018T01:27:09,SpazztasticKiwi,You’re welcome
10-04-2018T01:27:37,Vatruvius,for some reason does not feel better.
10-04-2018T01:28:27,SpazztasticKiwi,"Though if you want a story that doesn’t really kill anybody “important” (per se), but will still make your heart want to cry, I suggest the Poison Diaries"
10-04-2018T01:29:31,SpazztasticKiwi,by Maryrose Wood & Jane Northumberland
10-04-2018T01:30:19,Vatruvius,Hmm...I think I will pass. Green took enough tears from this guy.
10-04-2018T01:37:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Wonder how Tom’s been lately; he’s been quiet
10-04-2018T01:37:31,Vatruvius,He hasn't been on all day.
10-04-2018T01:38:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Don’t remember him being here yesterday either
10-04-2018T01:38:07,SpazztasticKiwi,🤔
10-04-2018T01:38:32,Vatruvius,I actually do not remember...I feel like he must have at least been online.
10-04-2018T01:39:17,SpazztasticKiwi,"Yeah, but I’ve noticed that he can be seen as online, but not necessarily be present"
10-04-2018T01:39:38,SpazztasticKiwi,We’ll probably find out later though. I gotta go to bed
10-04-2018T01:39:55,Vatruvius,Yeah...well goodnight Kiwi!
10-04-2018T01:40:15,Vatruvius,I am going to get off to...just kick back and watch movies until my battery runs out or something.
10-04-2018T01:46:17,Dadrobit,"Damn, I legitimately cannot find that statement Tom made, it got deleted from his news updates, The wayback machine doesn't have it either."
10-04-2018T01:46:49,Dadrobit,The best I can find is the last part of his statement that someone copy/pasted
10-04-2018T01:47:05,Dadrobit,"""The second fold of that two-foldedness I mentioned earlier unfortunately cannot be talked about right now. Saying anything specific would be a spoiler. However, what I can say is that Alaric's return is going to be an important factor in the overarching"
10-04-2018T01:47:18,Dadrobit,"plot. He is a party member for a reason. But again, going into anything more could potentially ruin things, so that's all I'll say about that for now."""
10-04-2018T01:47:55,Vatruvius,Then it doesn't exist Dadro...it never did! You cannot prove my statement is false!
10-04-2018T01:47:59,Vatruvius,Dangit!
10-04-2018T01:48:40,Dadrobit,":/ I'm sure FoMo has a copy of it somewhere, but I don't think he's actually here right now."
10-04-2018T01:48:43,Vatruvius,Hmm...that is a pretty convincing paragraph but still...in my time knowing Tom he trolls pretty good so...I do not mind really.
10-04-2018T01:49:17,Vatruvius,I doubt many of the people doing the backlash to the comic could do it to Tom's face.
10-04-2018T01:50:43,Dadrobit,They did and they do though.
10-04-2018T01:52:12,Vatruvius,Wow...then they should read a book on life and ownership law...or whatever the technical term is. Take a chill pill.
10-04-2018T01:52:38,Vatruvius,The fact that a large mass of people try to constrain an artist at all is just terrible.
10-04-2018T01:53:33,BadFoMo,"@Dadrobit I wanted to stay out, but... https://www.twokinds.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=843155#p843155"
10-04-2018T01:53:48,Dadrobit,"Ayyyyy, thanks! :D"
10-04-2018T01:54:19,Dadrobit,"Peeps just get invested in their stories is all, Vat."
10-04-2018T01:55:08,Dadrobit,And webcomic's not like books where everything is written and committed. The author can screw around with their reader as the story goes on.
10-04-2018T01:55:27,Dadrobit,But people aren't reading to get jerked around
10-04-2018T01:55:42,Dadrobit,"So when it happens, they're not cool with it."
10-04-2018T01:56:39,Vatruvius,Looks like this really was a huge topic...like really serious. I find that sad because I read the comic for fun and I trust in Tom's decision in which direction he wants his comic to go.
10-04-2018T01:57:02,Bgrmystr2,"In Tom's defense, there's nothing in the entire statement he wrote that would dis-prove it was a setup for april fools"
10-04-2018T01:57:04,Vatruvius,"If he pulled my leg really hard like that near April Fools...hey, no problem. I really am not that upset."
10-04-2018T01:57:11,Bgrmystr2,he didn't say anything was canonical
10-04-2018T01:57:12,Dadrobit,"That's exactly the point, those people ""trusted"" Tom as well, and then their trust was broken."
10-04-2018T01:57:32,Bgrmystr2,"so honestly, people got more out of the statement than he put into it, and jumped to conclusions"
10-04-2018T01:57:39,Bgrmystr2,which were not entirely accurate
10-04-2018T01:57:45,Vatruvius,I have learned to trust nothing Tom says.
10-04-2018T01:58:03,Dadrobit,""" plot. He is a party member for a reason. But again, going into anything more could potentially ruin things, so that's all I'll say about that for now."" Is pretty indicative that his return is for good yo."
10-04-2018T01:58:04,Vatruvius,And I have only been here a month.
10-04-2018T01:58:14,Dadrobit,"""Alaric's return is going to be an important factor in the overarching plot"""
10-04-2018T01:58:23,Dadrobit,Wrong copy/paste first time*
10-04-2018T01:58:36,Bgrmystr2,yeah the april fools plot lol
10-04-2018T01:58:44,Bgrmystr2,specifics are pretty important
10-04-2018T01:58:47,Vatruvius,"To me that is just a huge READ ME sign. ""I am a joke"" in blinking neon signs."
10-04-2018T01:58:49,Bgrmystr2,something he left out :P
10-04-2018T01:58:51,Dadrobit,"Let's not kid ourselves, he was absolutely trying to convince people Alaric was coming back."
10-04-2018T01:59:41,Bgrmystr2,I don't blame people for getting mad at it. But this is one of those moments where people look at something and jump to conclusions without all the information
10-04-2018T01:59:45,Bgrmystr2,and then get mad when they're wrong.
10-04-2018T01:59:47,Dadrobit,"I absolutely defend Tom being able to do AFD comics, but the extra paragraph was going too far."
10-04-2018T02:01:03,Vatruvius,Maybe...maybe not. I thought it was neat and it is what it is.
10-04-2018T02:01:59,Vatruvius,"I feel like that comic was really pushing the ""believe me"" to much but hey..."
10-04-2018T02:02:57,Vatruvius,Anyway...I am getting off. Catch you guys later. :ptv-greetings:
10-04-2018T02:03:45,Dadrobit,o/
10-04-2018T02:08:13,unsteddyphoenix,Personally I was never upset. I thought it was pretty well done.
10-04-2018T02:08:30,unsteddyphoenix,"Just when I was starting to get convinced it wasnt a prank, pranked"
10-04-2018T02:08:49,unsteddyphoenix,But objectively yeah it was clearly a mistake that probably cant be argued
10-04-2018T02:09:48,Dadrobit,"Same, I quite enjoyed the saga, but I get that a lot of people aren't as able to disconnect themselves as well."
10-04-2018T02:10:35,Dadrobit,"I actually personally speculated that it was like an alpha test to see how the community would react to the ""death"" of Zen."
10-04-2018T02:10:58,Dadrobit,Where he would use his connection to Natani to share that body instead.
10-04-2018T02:11:22,Dadrobit,"As at the time, his life was rather under threat."
10-04-2018T02:11:39,unsteddyphoenix,"Eh, that would make way more sense, though."
10-04-2018T02:12:11,unsteddyphoenix,Doubt many arguements against Alaric -&gt; lynn could be used for Zen -&gt; Natani
10-04-2018T02:12:57,Dadrobit,"Yeah, of course, that was back before I realized Tom was never going to kill another character ever again lol."
10-04-2018T02:13:54,unsteddyphoenix,April fools he is
10-04-2018T02:14:01,unsteddyphoenix,This is just the long con to MAKE you think that
10-04-2018T02:14:24,Dadrobit,"Especially since Tom had just updated this gem to the character bio for the duo ""it is unknown what will happen if one should die."""
10-04-2018T02:14:28,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe that was the purpose of it. To make the viewers unsure about everything
10-04-2018T02:15:05,unsteddyphoenix,Oh so he did
10-04-2018T02:15:33,unsteddyphoenix,That makes you think it WONT happen? Looks like a chekovs gun
10-04-2018T02:16:13,Dadrobit,"""This link, while a huge advantage in the field, is not without its disadvantages. They can never be separated, and it is unknown what will happen if one should die."" The full updated part"
10-04-2018T02:16:46,unsteddyphoenix,The last line seems completely unnecessary unless he was planning on killing one
10-04-2018T02:16:47,Dadrobit,Because Raine has already healed his leg.
10-04-2018T02:16:53,unsteddyphoenix,Not that I expect him to but
10-04-2018T02:17:10,unsteddyphoenix,Raine OP OP
10-04-2018T02:17:25,Bgrmystr2,"Honestly, I'm fairly sure it's pretty easy. If Natani dies, it'll affect Zen, but he's still prettymuch his entire self. He's not missing half of his mind. Natani dying would likely only just leave Zen by himself."
10-04-2018T02:17:29,Dadrobit,That was the basis for my argument. It was updated right as the April Fool's Day Comic was happening.
10-04-2018T02:18:02,Bgrmystr2,"Zen dying, on the other hand, would leave Natani with half a mind left.. which is not exactly ideal."
10-04-2018T02:18:33,Bgrmystr2,"That, or leave Natani with half of Zen's mind."
10-04-2018T02:18:42,Bgrmystr2,Which would be really strange
10-04-2018T02:18:44,Dadrobit,"I fully expect that when the bandages come off, Zen's leg will be more or less totally fine."
10-04-2018T02:19:08,unsteddyphoenix,"Im hoping for the cane. Still a consequence, just more PG"
10-04-2018T02:19:35,Dadrobit,I think it's going to be the lead-in for Raine to start understanding what kind of power she really has.
10-04-2018T02:19:40,unsteddyphoenix,The dang thing MELTING for chrissakes
10-04-2018T02:20:14,unsteddyphoenix,Raines an odd situation.
10-04-2018T02:20:22,unsteddyphoenix,She's like another protagonist
10-04-2018T02:20:22,Dadrobit,I still hold that Nibbs was actually dead and it was Raine who brought her back
10-04-2018T02:20:59,unsteddyphoenix,Honestly I feel like being thrown at a three wouldnt actually kill a squirrel in the first place? :thinking:
10-04-2018T02:21:14,Dadrobit,Twokinds is like an anime. The main protagonist is always the 4th most interesting character.
10-04-2018T02:21:31,Dadrobit,Fastball pitching it? You betcha.
10-04-2018T02:22:47,Bgrmystr2,"not instantly, I don't think"
10-04-2018T02:23:00,unsteddyphoenix,I remain unconvinced. Needs IRL testing.
10-04-2018T02:23:17,Bgrmystr2,I'm actually tempted to think Nibbly may be injured internally and noone knows
10-04-2018T02:23:18,unsteddyphoenix,You make a bland MC so the viewer can put themselves in their shoes.
10-04-2018T02:23:23,unsteddyphoenix,Movies do that too.
10-04-2018T02:23:39,unsteddyphoenix,Like the Matrix
10-04-2018T02:24:10,unsteddyphoenix,"Or POTC, which went downhill after they made Jack Sparrow the MC"
10-04-2018T02:24:46,Dadrobit,:/ My brother throwing squirrel sized rats on the ground works pretty well.
10-04-2018T02:24:48,unsteddyphoenix,"Anime is more ""everyman Jim and his harem"" though."
10-04-2018T02:25:06,unsteddyphoenix,Gross.
10-04-2018T02:25:22,Dadrobit,"Yeah, was glad to move away from that."
10-04-2018T02:25:38,unsteddyphoenix,"But nah I need some wind resistance, analysis of his throwing stance, average squirrel weight"
10-04-2018T02:26:00,Bgrmystr2,distance to tree too
10-04-2018T02:26:02,Bgrmystr2,:v
10-04-2018T02:26:06,unsteddyphoenix,Ye
10-04-2018T02:26:43,unsteddyphoenix,"When I was a POS shit, I dropped my grandfathers hella old cat off a 2 story balcony"
10-04-2018T02:26:49,unsteddyphoenix,*POS kid
10-04-2018T02:26:57,unsteddyphoenix,It literally hit the ground running
10-04-2018T02:27:13,Bgrmystr2,You know.. angle and medical analysis of impact would probably really help too. :P
10-04-2018T02:27:20,Bgrmystr2,but yeah animals are surprisingly resiliant
10-04-2018T02:27:26,Bgrmystr2,prolly spelled that wrong
10-04-2018T02:27:52,Bgrmystr2,resilient* I did.
10-04-2018T02:28:31,Dadrobit,"The tree was right next to him, and I think I found that the TV of a falling squirrel is way less than 25 mph, but a pitch of even an amateur can reach 50 mph. Nibs was a goner."
10-04-2018T02:29:25,Dadrobit,"Ignoring drag and TV, an object falling 20 feet is going 24.5mph when it hits the ground."
10-04-2018T02:29:42,Dadrobit,A squirrel to survive is doing much less.
10-04-2018T02:29:45,Bgrmystr2,:thinking: You keep saying TV and all I can think of is Television.
10-04-2018T02:29:52,Dadrobit,A pitcher is doubling that speed.
10-04-2018T02:30:00,Dadrobit,Terminal Velocity
10-04-2018T02:30:03,Bgrmystr2,and then I'm imagining Dadro dropping a TV on a squirrel lol
10-04-2018T02:30:08,Bgrmystr2,and I'm just.. why would you do that
10-04-2018T02:30:19,unsteddyphoenix,"""pitch"" is a strong word, really more of a ""fling"""
10-04-2018T02:30:37,Dadrobit,http://cdn.twokinds.keenspot.com/comics/20171004.jpg
10-04-2018T02:30:47,Dadrobit,That's a mighty fast fling you got going on there
10-04-2018T02:30:56,unsteddyphoenix,Ooo if he was left handed or right handed
10-04-2018T02:31:09,unsteddyphoenix,Motion blur for drama~
10-04-2018T02:31:34,unsteddyphoenix,"I guess maybe if Carver has anime strength, but that seems like a basitin thing"
10-04-2018T02:32:45,Bgrmystr2,"I'm still of the opinion that he probably didn't throw nibbly hard enough to kill her on impact, but internal injuries are going to be obvious."
10-04-2018T02:32:52,Dadrobit,He gestures and holds his magic rod left handed
10-04-2018T02:33:34,Bgrmystr2,I sometimes do stuff with my left hand even though I'm right-handed
10-04-2018T02:33:43,Bgrmystr2,"hell, some things I prefer doing with my left hand"
10-04-2018T02:33:48,unsteddyphoenix,Nah that's probably enough to assume he's left handed
10-04-2018T02:34:26,Dadrobit,Don't think it's anime strength to hit 50mph. Kids do that.
10-04-2018T02:34:53,unsteddyphoenix,Maybe he did like a wind-up offscreen
10-04-2018T02:35:28,unsteddyphoenix,"*heyyy batter batter~"""
10-04-2018T02:35:41,Bgrmystr2,haha
10-04-2018T02:35:46,Dadrobit,"(F=ma) Force is multiplicative, and she is potentially hitting that tree at twice the speed she'd hit the ground falling in a complete vacuum."
10-04-2018T02:35:53,Dadrobit,Ded
10-04-2018T02:36:13,Dadrobit,But Raine had the proverbial curve ball in bringing her back!
10-04-2018T02:37:54,Bgrmystr2,I'm not convinced. Their world has magic and other things that do not align with our world. Their gravity could be different. The amount of force to injure could also be different
10-04-2018T02:38:08,unsteddyphoenix,"Hmm...squirrel wieght varies, but i'd put it at 500g?"
10-04-2018T02:39:12,Dadrobit,I'm convinced that it would make a better story for Raine to come to the realization of her powers through accomplishing a feat that not even Trace could do without going mad.
10-04-2018T02:40:15,Bgrmystr2,"Perhaps nibbly wouldn't survive the throw here, on Earth, but on Mekkan there's not enough information about Mekkan. Also, Raine did say specifically in the comic there wasn't anything she could do, as she spent all her magic sending carver away."
10-04-2018T02:40:30,Bgrmystr2,"I'm sure if any of it went towards Nibbly, she probably would have known."
10-04-2018T02:40:48,unsteddyphoenix,wow how does the internet not have any info about throwing squirrels at trees
10-04-2018T02:40:50,unsteddyphoenix,Letting me down here
10-04-2018T02:41:18,unsteddyphoenix,"Im more in the ""somethings up with nibbly"" camp. Her hdiing from Reni 'cause she doesnt want her mind read is too interesting of an idea."
10-04-2018T02:41:36,Bgrmystr2,"xD Yes I'm sure if you search google, It'll tell you all the math and medical science behind throwing squirrels at trees in twokinds."
10-04-2018T02:41:43,unsteddyphoenix,if Raine healed her I feel like Tom'd make it obvious with some glowy effects
10-04-2018T02:41:50,unsteddyphoenix,"Youd think so, but youd be wrong! :O"
10-04-2018T02:42:04,Bgrmystr2,I know I'd be wrong :D
10-04-2018T02:42:43,Bgrmystr2,"I, too, feel that if Raine had healed Nibbly, even unconsciously, there'd be glowy effects or something"
10-04-2018T02:43:35,Dadrobit,Her eyes continue to glow slightly until after Zen is wrapped up. I think she was just radiating it without knowing.
10-04-2018T02:45:09,unsteddyphoenix,Brb fud
10-04-2018T02:45:53,Bgrmystr2,"Yeah, that tends to happen after anyone uses magic, Dadro. It's likely an aftereffect of using magic in general. It doesn't necessarily mean that magic is still being used."
10-04-2018T02:46:05,Bgrmystr2,Things glow.
10-04-2018T02:46:25,Bgrmystr2,"They still glow even after magic stops, they just seem to slowly dim and the glow disappears."
10-04-2018T02:46:42,Bgrmystr2,I don't know why Raine is different.
10-04-2018T02:46:50,Bgrmystr2,I don't think she is.
10-04-2018T03:41:50,unsteddyphoenix,"Maybe she can silent cast, add that to her evergrowing list of powers"
10-04-2018T03:44:15,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
10-04-2018T03:51:16,unsteddyphoenix,Having innate powers you dont understand is basically what a sorceror from Dnd is
10-04-2018T03:51:26,unsteddyphoenix,And Sorcerors can silent cast
10-04-2018T03:51:29,unsteddyphoenix,And Tom PLAYS DND
10-04-2018T03:51:42,unsteddyphoenix,Im on to something here
10-04-2018T11:06:02,Vatruvius,Hmm...were you guys addressing the fact that Nibbly should have died hitting that tree? If so...gravity did not have much to do with it as she was flung into the tree at a far faster speed than gravity could have influenced. In either case...
10-04-2018T11:06:12,Vatruvius,Nibbly is hiding something.
10-04-2018T11:07:03,Vatruvius,Also...good morning everyone! :ptv-greetings:
10-04-2018T12:33:27,Dadrobit,Finally watched last Sunday's stream.
10-04-2018T12:34:15,Dadrobit,"Man, it's difficult. I kept thinking about responding to people in chat only to remember..."
10-04-2018T12:42:22,Vatruvius,Last Sunday? What were we talking about? Or was it just normal chat?
10-04-2018T12:53:01,Dadrobit,Just watched the segment that I missed.
10-04-2018T12:53:13,Dadrobit,Which just happened to be when Tom picked my suggestion
10-04-2018T12:53:27,Dadrobit,But some stuff came up like people asking about lore stuffs.
10-04-2018T12:53:45,Dadrobit,And Tom forgot to put ears and a tail on Maddie and Alaric respectively
10-04-2018T12:54:22,Dadrobit,Ad of corse other random comments/discussions I had the urge to respond to.
10-04-2018T12:54:29,Vatruvius,lol...no one noticed except for one.
10-04-2018T12:54:42,Vatruvius,Of course.
10-04-2018T12:55:53,Vatruvius,And I just finished making orange/cranberry scones...yum.
10-04-2018T12:56:22,Vatruvius,Wow...I think this is the lowest number of people on this chat I have ever seen...only 6 people.
10-04-2018T13:02:35,Dadrobit,About to be one less. Heading in to class in a few minutes.
10-04-2018T13:02:46,Vatruvius,Well good luck.
10-04-2018T13:02:55,Vatruvius,Have fun....and other stuff.
10-04-2018T15:04:02,JaydenMozingo,I noticed the weekly stream schedule was changed. It no longer says page stream on wednesday. has the day for page srteams changed or is it just for simplicity?
10-04-2018T15:08:12,Vatruvius,Tom no longer has a dedicated page stream day.
10-04-2018T15:08:53,Vatruvius,"He will either do the page stream on the Friday ""Art"" stream or if there is other stuff that need to be done then like Nora Cards then he will do the page stream some time in the week. It is up to him when that is."
10-04-2018T15:27:04,Bgrmystr2,"Vatru, the reason I said gravity was not because the throw itself would be affected, but because nibbly's body would be different."
10-04-2018T15:27:47,Bgrmystr2,"if their gravity is higher than ours, their bodies would need to have stronger muscles, and be able to withstand that kind of gravity level"
10-04-2018T15:28:26,Bgrmystr2,and that increased strength could easily help a squirrel like nibbly survive an impact with a tree that she wouldn't survive here
10-04-2018T15:28:45,Bgrmystr2,that kind of thing matters.
10-04-2018T15:32:32,JaydenMozingo,"Oh, I get that. I guess it would be easier to have the page stream on any day rather than to stress on when to do it."
10-04-2018T15:32:59,JaydenMozingo,Well thanks you guys!
10-04-2018T15:35:17,Bgrmystr2,yeah it's been that way for a while now Jay
10-04-2018T15:35:28,Bgrmystr2,surprising that it took you this long to notice
10-04-2018T15:39:24,Bgrmystr2,"also, I didn't leave the chat room last night, picarto disconnected me, giving me the reconnecting error loop the whole time, ever since you woke up vatru"
10-04-2018T15:40:15,Bgrmystr2,"so it's likely that other people in the chat also got the disconnection, and that's why the user count is lower."
10-04-2018T16:25:39,Vatruvius,I see...muscle density does mattet mot to mention the chemical make up of the bj ones of organisms on higher gravity worlds.
10-04-2018T16:26:14,Vatruvius,I see about the disconnects...itbhas just been the lowest I have seen so far.
