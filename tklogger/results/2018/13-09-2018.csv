13-09-2018T00:00:11,Vatruvius,lol
13-09-2018T00:00:16,Vatruvius,Tom misses out.
13-09-2018T00:00:40,Bgrmystr2,gnight then o/
13-09-2018T00:00:57,Vatruvius,Night Kiwi!
13-09-2018T00:02:51,Vatruvius,Now you got me all paranoid with that copyright comment Tom. I don't even have any physical work! :ctwokinds-RaineEep:
13-09-2018T00:03:07,Twokinds,I was joking
13-09-2018T00:03:14,Vatruvius,"Yeah, but still."
13-09-2018T00:03:25,Vatruvius,It is a real thing I will have to dig into at some point.
13-09-2018T00:04:02,Vatruvius,I think I will save if for when I have actually work to submit a copyright for.
13-09-2018T00:05:53,Vatruvius,"By the way, I am now 4 weeks from ordering my drawing monitor from Huion. I am getting excited."
13-09-2018T00:06:12,Dadrobit,copyright is more or less pretty easy/straightforward https://www.copyright.gov/registration/
13-09-2018T00:06:16,Dadrobit,Have fun
13-09-2018T00:06:49,Dadrobit,Unless you're not in the US?
13-09-2018T00:07:08,Vatruvius,"I am in the Golden State, so it applies."
13-09-2018T00:07:48,Vatruvius,"But yeah, I saw that too. I found it interesting that, just in the FAQ, it is not required that a work be connected to a real name, a pseudo name or stage name works to."
13-09-2018T00:07:57,Vatruvius,I will do more digging into that.
13-09-2018T00:08:31,Vatruvius,But until I really get some work for which an application seems necessary I will hold off and not stress myself over it.
13-09-2018T00:08:44,Twokinds,I wouldn't worry about it too much
13-09-2018T00:09:21,Vatruvius,Have you actually ever had to issue a copyright strike Tom?
13-09-2018T00:09:43,Dadrobit,"Technically, you don't even need to register for copyright protection for it to apply so long as you are an original author, and have a fixed expression of your work."
13-09-2018T00:10:11,Vatruvius,Like a signature or something tying the work to you?
13-09-2018T00:10:25,Dadrobit,"However, registering before a problem arises helps."
13-09-2018T00:10:41,Vatruvius,"Yeah, I plan to register my web comic before I post anything."
13-09-2018T00:11:25,Dadrobit,"Technically X2, you don't even need to publish your work to have copyright protection."
13-09-2018T00:11:41,Vatruvius,"Yeah, I saw that."
13-09-2018T00:12:06,Dadrobit,"So long as there is a fixed expression of your work that you can point to and say, ""I made this myself"" then you're protected."
13-09-2018T00:13:04,Vatruvius,"Yeah, legal stuff freaks me out. I think it will be simple to get working but it still freaks me out."
13-09-2018T00:13:54,Dadrobit,"Personally, I took copyright law classes to cover my ass. But I get that isn't available for everyone."
13-09-2018T00:14:26,Vatruvius,"Umm, I may be able to take an introductory into copyright law at my CC but I don't know."
13-09-2018T00:27:38,unsteddyphoenix,Google is your friend
13-09-2018T00:27:54,Vatruvius,"Yeah, I use it a lot."
13-09-2018T00:28:23,unsteddyphoenix,That or harrassing your friends for explanations to things
13-09-2018T00:28:27,Vatruvius,"Oh my, I caught myself when I typed sue in place of use..."
13-09-2018T00:28:33,unsteddyphoenix,"Like, now if it's ever relevant i'd bother dad until he explained"
13-09-2018T00:28:56,Vatruvius,I doubt my dad knows anything about copyright law.
13-09-2018T00:29:56,Dadrobit,Should we tell him?
13-09-2018T00:30:13,unsteddyphoenix,He'll puzzle it out
13-09-2018T00:30:15,unsteddyphoenix,...probably
13-09-2018T00:30:23,Vatruvius,Excuse me?

13-09-2018T00:31:21,Bgrmystr2,you're welcome.
13-09-2018T00:31:45,Vatruvius,lol
13-09-2018T00:32:44,Vatruvius,"And I am most certainly not new, I have been here for many months. I was derailed when I talked about my dad earlier so Dadro was completely out of my mind."
13-09-2018T00:33:00,Dadrobit,"Also, I am legally unable to give legal advice. So that's a thing."
13-09-2018T00:33:13,Vatruvius,What?
13-09-2018T00:33:17,unsteddyphoenix,See Dads already taught me something

13-09-2018T00:34:38,Vatruvius,I would like to further work on my web comic story right now but I can't think of anything. I think I will sit down for an afternoon and just work on it over the weekend.
13-09-2018T00:34:53,Vatruvius,So what else should I do to pass the time tonight?
13-09-2018T00:36:23,Vatruvius,I guess I could watch a movie.
13-09-2018T00:36:25,Vatruvius,Hmm...
13-09-2018T00:36:30,Vatruvius,I think I will do that.
13-09-2018T00:36:35,Vatruvius,And check the chat.
13-09-2018T00:39:35,Dadrobit,Watch a classic.
13-09-2018T00:39:40,Dadrobit,Like Super Mario Bros or something.
13-09-2018T00:40:16,Vatruvius,Ugh...I am on Neflix so...I am just watching something that I haven't watch in a while as they do not update new stuff on here. D:
13-09-2018T00:40:50,Bgrmystr2,or.. you could watch an actually good movie.. like Back to the Future
13-09-2018T00:42:56,Vatruvius,Yeah.
13-09-2018T00:43:05,Vatruvius,Don't think that is on Netflix.
13-09-2018T00:43:08,Vatruvius,Online anyway.
13-09-2018T00:44:05,Vatruvius,Nope.
13-09-2018T01:01:47,Vatruvius,"I best be going, I found something to occupy me for the next two hours. See you guys afterwards."

13-09-2018T02:04:42,unsteddyphoenix,Have we talked about this?
13-09-2018T02:06:19,Twokinds,1 wolf talk
13-09-2018T02:08:03,Miftox01,And if nibs sits on his head then one wolf plus squirrel
13-09-2018T02:08:44,unsteddyphoenix,Is one Raine-wolf talk = to one sythe wolf talk?
13-09-2018T02:09:34,Twokinds,I don't really have a specific height for Sythe
13-09-2018T02:09:46,Twokinds,He's not as tall as Zen
13-09-2018T02:12:00,unsteddyphoenix,Hmm I see
13-09-2018T02:12:09,unsteddyphoenix,It seems like he's grown over the years lol

13-09-2018T02:23:29,Twokinds,"But eh, whatever"
13-09-2018T02:25:05,unsteddyphoenix,You have been going through a

13-09-2018T02:40:55,Dadrobit,"Reminds me of Housepets, how gradually over time nearly every character (that isn't obviously overweight) changed to have well defined musculature."
13-09-2018T02:41:02,Dadrobit,"Personally, I like it."
13-09-2018T02:41:09,Dadrobit,Aesthetic and all that.

13-09-2018T16:43:59,CrimsonQuill,I often see music as colours or scenes. It's often influenced by where or how I first hear it.

13-09-2018T19:50:18,FoxxTrotter,Neither is w0lf.
13-09-2018T19:51:07,FoxxTrotter,There's only a little bit of rain and wind in Virginia. Most of it is in North and South Carolina.
13-09-2018T19:51:17,MoonDance,yo
13-09-2018T19:51:21,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Hi Moon
13-09-2018T19:52:05,Bgrmystr2,"Sage specifically said he's gonna be getting rain and wind on his patreon, so.. you are corrected? :u"
13-09-2018T19:53:09,FoxxTrotter,Maybe earlier.
13-09-2018T19:53:28,MoonDance,Hey Marv
13-09-2018T19:53:35,Bgrmystr2,"last I recall, Sage lives in, or close to the Carolinas anyway"
13-09-2018T19:53:48,SpotTheLeopard,I'm waiting to see how New Bern survives... looks pretty flooded from what photos I've seen so far
13-09-2018T19:55:15,FoxxTrotter,"He lives in the Tidewater area. They are getting rain now according to the radar. It won't last long up there, though."
13-09-2018T19:55:48,SageSaga,Im really close to the coast of VA - but yeah the storm isnt hitting here much at all - good news for me
13-09-2018T19:55:52,FoxxTrotter,I'm probably in it for most of the night.
13-09-2018T19:56:07,Bgrmystr2,ah okay sage
13-09-2018T19:56:10,Mippy,Hey 👋
13-09-2018T19:56:10,Bgrmystr2,good to know
13-09-2018T19:56:22,SageSaga,they were calling for it to head further north a few days ago- when i did my patreon post- but now it's tried to drive inland much harder- and is killing the storm
13-09-2018T19:56:26,FoxxTrotter,New Bern and Wilmington got hit the hardest in NC.
13-09-2018T19:56:40,FoxxTrotter,Myrtle Beach in SC.
13-09-2018T19:57:12,SpotTheLeopard,"good to see you're doing alright, Sage"
13-09-2018T19:57:29,FoxxTrotter,The center of the storm is almost over Myrtle Beach right now.
13-09-2018T19:57:30,SageSaga,so far at least- unrelated though is the fact that my fridge is broken
13-09-2018T19:57:38,Mippy,Being no where near the store but having lived in Canada’s hurricane ally I definitely feel for you all
13-09-2018T19:57:41,SageSaga,and wont be replaced till Tuesday

13-09-2018T20:08:49,GreybowFalcona,"Hell, I need anything to get through this storm.  Zoie and the girls are in another state staying out of it. Here alone at the house"
13-09-2018T20:08:54,SageSaga,Combak- i think he means for me- my stream
13-09-2018T20:08:57,GreybowFalcona,Too.... damn... quiet

13-09-2018T20:11:11,Rosscoe,why did picarto micro size the streams? :ptv-confused:
13-09-2018T20:11:20,SageSaga,it didnt
13-09-2018T20:11:45,Mihari,You scrolled down most likely
13-09-2018T20:11:51,Bgrmystr2,"well, when they updated the UI, they did, but it's been quite a while since then"
13-09-2018T20:11:53,Bgrmystr2,several months
13-09-2018T20:12:09,JamesBSquirrel3,"Hey Marv, I watch DragonBall 's I love the most!:heart_eyes:"
13-09-2018T20:12:16,Rosscoe,"no scroll down, I have a screen cap XD"
13-09-2018T20:13:00,Bgrmystr2,"well, scrolling down makes the streams appear at the top left in a small window"
13-09-2018T20:13:09,Bgrmystr2,it's fairly new
13-09-2018T20:13:17,Rosscoe,I know of it
13-09-2018T20:13:35,Mippy,Anyone else naked from the knees down right now?
13-09-2018T20:13:42,Mihari,You can also drag the chat to be a bit smaller if you want to slightly increase or decrease the video for more/less chat room
13-09-2018T20:13:48,Matth3w23,"Oddly, yes mippy"
13-09-2018T20:13:51,Rosscoe,"but I did not scroll down lol, infact it enlarged the overall player screen and threw those tow into what would be a scroll down"
13-09-2018T20:14:10,Rosscoe,and yes I am wearing shorts Mippy :P
13-09-2018T20:14:11,Mihari,"Yes, but I just came in from the rain and haven't put something new on yet."
13-09-2018T20:14:28,Mippy,XD
13-09-2018T20:14:28,Dadrobit,What an oddly specific location to be naked from?
13-09-2018T20:14:38,Bgrmystr2,I wear shorts basically every day? :o
13-09-2018T20:14:45,Rosscoe,We had rain but not so much today

13-09-2018T20:51:23,SageSaga,he uses a Cintiq
13-09-2018T20:51:29,Nekonny,"no, just a layer throwing off my color picker"
13-09-2018T20:52:00,Afallingtree,Cintiqs are like $1000

13-09-2018T20:52:46,SageSaga,for the cheap cintiqs you are looking at 1000 USD
13-09-2018T20:52:51,HeresyArtStream,"I got a 20"" Yiynova for $400"

13-09-2018T20:53:36,Twokinds,"There, now it looks a little more like a glasstop table"
13-09-2018T20:53:37,SageSaga,actually i think there is a lower price cintiq now that the touch ones are more common
13-09-2018T20:54:00,Afallingtree,that reflection tho
13-09-2018T20:54:15,totallynotTrace,now it looks like photorealistic glasstop table :/

13-09-2018T21:10:11,microbuss,hey Tom How does a female become king?
13-09-2018T21:10:32,JamesBSquirrel3,You mean Queen?
13-09-2018T21:10:43,microbuss,King she is
13-09-2018T21:10:53,unsteddyphoenix,through great power
13-09-2018T21:11:02,Bgrmystr2,"She is a King, it's just what they call 'er."

13-09-2018T21:11:26,microbuss,that or she takes over her husband's kingship
13-09-2018T21:11:44,Bgrmystr2,she's king because she's the strongest. Tis all it is.
13-09-2018T21:11:57,microbuss,true
13-09-2018T21:12:03,unsteddyphoenix,Her husband wasnt even the previous king

13-09-2018T21:15:25,microbuss,yes
13-09-2018T21:16:51,Twokinds,The Basitins just don't use different words for it.

13-09-2018T21:18:29,unsteddyphoenix,"Maybe the ""King"" thing is just a mistranslation lol"
13-09-2018T21:19:11,CrRAR,blasphemy!
13-09-2018T21:19:14,gtaor,wow tom said hi to me
13-09-2018T21:19:15,SpotTheLeopard,"dragon book series I read a long time ago had a similar setup - King was the position, had nothing to do with gender"

13-09-2018T21:22:06,unsteddyphoenix,artistress

13-09-2018T21:26:37,SpotTheLeopard,maybe add her shadow cast on the side of the train?
13-09-2018T21:27:41,Nekonny,the more I mess around with it the worse it seems to get

13-09-2018T22:16:49,totallynotTrace,no its liquid nitrogen.
13-09-2018T22:17:00,totallynotTrace,yeah probably water
13-09-2018T22:18:39,MviluUatusun,I think my kitten is having a fit.  She's running around like a chicken with its head cut off.  LOL.
13-09-2018T22:19:44,ZRO4825,"LOL, I usually call that ""the rips"", because the cat's ""ripping"" from one end of the house to the other. XD"
13-09-2018T22:20:15,JamesBSquirrel3,:slight_smile:Oh wow Ron! That's a start!
13-09-2018T22:20:18,MviluUatusun,"Well, that's the perfect description of what she's doing, ZRO.  She's even ""attacking"" my older white cat."
13-09-2018T22:20:29,ZRO4825,XD Yup! That's the rips alright.
13-09-2018T22:21:36,microbuss,that or she sees a ghost OR she got into catnip lol
13-09-2018T22:21:53,JamesBSquirrel3,"@MviluUatusun, you saying is it a cat fight?"
13-09-2018T22:21:54,MarvTheHugPharaoh,:ghost:
13-09-2018T22:22:14,CrRAR,"Hopefully big cat does not ""rip"" lil cat."

13-09-2018T22:22:36,MviluUatusun,"Well, Me-you does get a bit overbearing and Buddy has to put her in her place."
13-09-2018T22:22:48,CrRAR,haha
13-09-2018T22:22:56,MviluUatusun,"I think she's too young for catnip to affect her, micro."
13-09-2018T22:23:02,microbuss,ah kitten is just being a kitten
13-09-2018T22:23:03,MviluUatusun,She's only about 2 months old.
13-09-2018T22:23:11,JamesBSquirrel3,Well I'm suprise.:ptv-scratch:
13-09-2018T22:23:32,microbuss,nopes  catnip affects every age of a cat
13-09-2018T22:23:42,MviluUatusun,"When I got her about 5 weeks ago, she was about 4 weeks old."
13-09-2018T22:24:01,JamesBSquirrel3,Awww
13-09-2018T22:24:06,microbuss,4 weeks = month
13-09-2018T22:24:16,MviluUatusun,"Interesting, micro.  I'd always been told that catnip didn't affect cats until they were at least 4 months old."
13-09-2018T22:24:20,CrRAR,excellent calculations
13-09-2018T22:25:02,MviluUatusun,"That's true, micro.  I think that someone dropped her off to die because we never could find her mother."
13-09-2018T22:25:04,microbuss,well its my fursonas Krptonite :P
