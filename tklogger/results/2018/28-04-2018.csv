28-04-2018T00:00:43,Vatruvius,That is why myaspirations to do sny form of online entertainment is sitting on the back burner until I get better internet. That snd a better computer so the videos can be 1080p 60fps.
28-04-2018T00:01:07,Vatruvius,my aspirations* any*
28-04-2018T00:01:15,Vatruvius,and*
28-04-2018T00:10:14,DRAGONTANOPUG,My internet speed is 2mbs :ptv-shock:
28-04-2018T00:11:32,Bgrmystr2,"if it was really 2mb/s, there'd be no way for you to actually watch the streams ever"
28-04-2018T00:11:34,Bgrmystr2,they'd never load
28-04-2018T00:11:50,Bgrmystr2,that's not fast enough
28-04-2018T00:25:54,DRAGONTANOPUG,Ooh uh meh sisters on netflix right now?
28-04-2018T00:26:07,Vatruvius,Probably 2MB/s.
28-04-2018T00:26:07,DRAGONTANOPUG,Its slow tho
28-04-2018T00:26:46,Vatruvius,"And your sister using diwnload, not upload when watching Netflix."
28-04-2018T00:26:58,Vatruvius,download*
28-04-2018T00:28:32,DRAGONTANOPUG,When I download games on my Xbox it says 3 MBS
28-04-2018T00:28:37,DRAGONTANOPUG,But still slow
28-04-2018T00:28:57,DRAGONTANOPUG,Er
28-04-2018T00:29:42,Vatruvius,"That is skow relatively speaking, but compared to my internet that is awesome."
28-04-2018T00:30:00,Vatruvius,slow*
28-04-2018T00:30:29,Bgrmystr2,3MB/s is about a 25mbit line. That's fairly common.
28-04-2018T00:31:15,Bgrmystr2,"lot of places have 25 and 50mbit lines, some bigger cities have 100mbit lines too"
28-04-2018T00:31:44,Bgrmystr2,"anything higher is pretty rare, though, ignoring business or fiber"
28-04-2018T00:39:36,DRAGONTANOPUG,My dads fucking turing it up with fucking 200 mbs :ptv-angry:
28-04-2018T00:39:46,DRAGONTANOPUG,Gaming is so hard...
28-04-2018T00:43:17,Vatruvius,"I am not even going to ask. Goodnight people, eyes are closing on me. :ptv-greetings:"

28-04-2018T01:24:51,Dadrobit,Just got done w/ some work.
28-04-2018T01:28:36,Dadrobit,"Kind of want to play a game, but I don't think I have anything that I could really pick up and just put right back down."
28-04-2018T01:28:49,Dadrobit,I binge too hard.
28-04-2018T01:28:59,Dadrobit,No bueno with finals happening right now.
28-04-2018T01:34:10,TheBeckoner,same. I have so much work coming up for classes.
28-04-2018T02:02:24,Dadrobit,Only thing I'm really stressing about is my copyright law class. Need at least around an 85% to maintain an A.
28-04-2018T02:02:48,Dadrobit,I missed an assignment recently and it really hurt my grade.
28-04-2018T02:03:13,Dadrobit,The usual format is Test-Essay-Test-Essay all year round.
28-04-2018T02:03:46,Dadrobit,But they threw in a mandatory Q&A session that I had no idea was coming.
28-04-2018T02:03:57,Dadrobit,0 points does bad things to the overall.
28-04-2018T02:05:10,Dadrobit,"I mean, if I read the syllabus more carefully/often, I would have seen it, so it is kinda my fault, but still..."
28-04-2018T11:26:53,DRAGONTANOPUG,Just beat my record for longest time without sleep.
28-04-2018T11:27:21,DRAGONTANOPUG,39 hours
28-04-2018T12:26:42,Vatruvius,I would not say that is a record worth beating.
28-04-2018T12:27:26,Vatruvius,Also...hello everyone! :ptv-greetings: Just enjoying waffles for breakfast.

28-04-2018T13:14:26,Vatruvius,"I just did it, though I am not sure if I did it in time. But it is not like the sketch stream so maybe?"

28-04-2018T13:39:41,Vatruvius,But this one is pretty cool.
28-04-2018T13:45:50,Combak,Didn't we already see that with Nora giving the human buuny ears a while ago?
28-04-2018T13:45:54,Combak,*bunny

28-04-2018T14:08:23,Mippy,Sitting at work. Waiting for the bus so I can start the two hour long commute home. Will pop in from time to time until I can get to a computer.
28-04-2018T14:08:52,Vatruvius,That is a long commute to work and back.
28-04-2018T14:09:57,Mippy,"Yup, two busses and a walk. That’s what I get for getting a job on the other side of the city."
28-04-2018T14:10:35,Mippy,My Mom just texted me. She’s picking me up. Guess I’ll get to a computer quicker.
28-04-2018T14:16:10,Mippy,The commute is a lot shorter if I have a ride that can take me directly home
28-04-2018T14:17:56,Vatruvius,Yeah.
28-04-2018T14:22:18,SpazztasticKiwi,"You know how I said I was going to see Infinity War Tuesday with my sister, and mom?"
28-04-2018T14:23:04,SpazztasticKiwi,"They changed their minds and went today. And after asking me if I was going too once this morning, they left without me"
28-04-2018T14:23:41,SpazztasticKiwi,I worked a ten hour shift Saturday. I was tired
28-04-2018T14:23:56,SilliconCarbide,well that sucks
28-04-2018T14:24:20,SpazztasticKiwi,This is the second time they’ve done something like this
28-04-2018T14:24:39,SilliconCarbide,perhaps you should look for other people to go to the cinema?
28-04-2018T14:25:25,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m looking for another family

28-04-2018T15:05:53,Vatruvius,"Just put the grounds in a tea bag, it'll work out."
28-04-2018T15:05:58,DrakeSlayerJake,sad times indeed
28-04-2018T15:06:00,Ordithus,"His mom somehow broke it.  At least, that's what Tom said."

28-04-2018T15:11:52,Vatruvius,"Fine, I will just bomb the house Drake. Problems, plural, solved."
28-04-2018T15:12:07,MarvTheHugPharaoh,He would only be British if he was also getting crumpets
28-04-2018T15:12:20,DrakeSlayerJake,anti bomb sheild!

28-04-2018T15:13:42,MarvTheHugPharaoh,4:30 Hawaii time
28-04-2018T15:13:54,Vatruvius,Because Tom does not live in your outdated world TANO

28-04-2018T15:14:34,Vatruvius,I would have thought the 4:20 thing died a long time ago but it seems like it is purely an age thing.
28-04-2018T15:14:36,SemiDemiGod,about 15 minutes
28-04-2018T15:14:51,eriklol29,Ok
28-04-2018T15:15:09,SemiDemiGod,apparently it didnt. cant walk into a class without someone using that jke
28-04-2018T15:15:32,DrakeSlayerJake,"not really, people still refernce it heavilly, but only like once a year"
28-04-2018T15:15:33,Vatruvius,"Well, I am in college now and even in high school it died out quick."
28-04-2018T15:15:38,DrakeSlayerJake,9 days ago
28-04-2018T15:15:54,DrakeSlayerJake,eh
28-04-2018T15:16:07,Vatruvius,Though I would say my high school is nothing like a typical high school so...
28-04-2018T15:16:10,Vatruvius,yeah.
28-04-2018T15:16:20,Bgrmystr2,"there we go, brower broke itself. finally back"

28-04-2018T15:16:55,Vatruvius,"It was not an ivy league high school. Just an early college one, free like any other public school."
28-04-2018T15:16:56,Bgrmystr2,what highschol is fancy..?

28-04-2018T15:17:54,Mippy,I decided to just be lazy and use a tea bag intead of loose leaf
28-04-2018T15:17:58,Bgrmystr2,And jumps to the beginning sometimes
28-04-2018T15:18:05,ThingsAreMoving,back
28-04-2018T15:18:15,ThingsAreMoving,"have you tried cleaning the keyboard, bgr?"

28-04-2018T15:19:22,Bgrmystr2,what I'm gonna do is clean the tea off my desktop keys so I can type
28-04-2018T15:19:38,Vatruvius,"That does sound like a shitty laptop. The jumping to the beginning would be the track pad though, accidentally tapping it while typing."
28-04-2018T15:19:40,ThingsAreMoving,you can always get a cheap keyboard and plug it to the laptop
28-04-2018T15:20:01,Bgrmystr2,"also, lol dragon thinking I would have done.. this  is literally my backup keyboard when my desktop keyboard isn't working"

28-04-2018T16:21:04,SpazztasticKiwi,You guys would see quite a few bikini like outfits if you went to a convention
28-04-2018T16:21:16,Xexanoth,but there's people at conventions
28-04-2018T16:21:16,Vatruvius,What if it was cold?
28-04-2018T16:21:17,Dadrobit,Hahahahahahaha!
28-04-2018T16:21:23,Issus,"Depends on the con, most I've been to have banned them."
28-04-2018T16:21:23,ThingsAreMoving,200 is average I'd say
28-04-2018T16:21:23,Xexanoth,and we would have to go outside
28-04-2018T16:21:29,PalmettoPathfinder1,Spazz unfortunately I can't go to conventions.  Costs way too much money.
28-04-2018T16:21:30,Dadrobit,Like most of the people here actually leave the house
28-04-2018T16:21:32,SpazztasticKiwi,"At PAX, there were a few bombing cosplays that made me want to hide they looked so nice"

28-04-2018T16:22:54,Xexanoth,isn't a bomb the exact opposite of cool?
28-04-2018T16:23:01,unsteddyphoenix,Dont think theyre avaliable
28-04-2018T16:23:07,ThingsAreMoving,depends on the bomb itself I think
28-04-2018T16:23:09,Xexanoth,you literally create heat after all
28-04-2018T16:23:11,Vatruvius,Nah...I have heard it used to describe something cool Xex
28-04-2018T16:23:24,Bgrmystr2,can be used both ways
28-04-2018T16:23:27,Dadrobit,What about a dry ice bomb?
28-04-2018T16:23:35,TheBeckoner,"Never heard ""bombing"" mean cool tbh"

28-04-2018T16:23:51,SpazztasticKiwi,There was a girl cosplaying some girl’s “armor” from a video game and I saw a guy tweak his neck turning around to watch her go by

28-04-2018T16:24:33,Vatruvius,"I like how they still call it ""armor"" Kiwi."
28-04-2018T16:24:39,Wyvern088,if I ever get SWATed im dead
28-04-2018T16:24:46,SpazztasticKiwi,It was a metal bikini
28-04-2018T16:24:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Basically
28-04-2018T16:24:53,Xexanoth,i would love Swat to try to get to me
28-04-2018T16:24:54,Wyvern088,too much airsoft stuff lying around
28-04-2018T16:25:01,Vatruvius,And that is why it does not qualify as armor.
28-04-2018T16:25:04,ItsActuallyKopyKat,HA
28-04-2018T16:25:11,ItsActuallyKopyKat,Let me tell you all a story about airsofting
28-04-2018T16:25:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Tell that to the video game developers
28-04-2018T16:25:15,ItsActuallyKopyKat,In like five mins
28-04-2018T16:25:21,ThingsAreMoving,If I were making a metal bikini I'd glue an arrow or two just to show how effective it is

28-04-2018T16:25:43,unsteddyphoenix,jeez
28-04-2018T16:25:44,Xexanoth,Female video game armors work by distracting the enemy by showing skin
28-04-2018T16:25:44,Dadrobit,I would actually love to see something like that.
28-04-2018T16:25:50,TheBeckoner,And as little of it as they like!
28-04-2018T16:25:53,SpazztasticKiwi,"But in most games, female armor is more like lingerie"
28-04-2018T16:26:06,Dadrobit,"just arrows perfectly hitting where there is ""armor"" cover."
28-04-2018T16:26:07,Xexanoth,"eh, it's gotten alot better Kiwi"

28-04-2018T16:26:30,Mippy,As a woman I'd rather wear armor that was actually practical in a battle than a metal bikini
28-04-2018T16:26:31,unsteddyphoenix,But yeah most games are catching on to actual armour now
28-04-2018T16:26:31,Vatruvius,"If it is a choice, fine. But do not tell me that is armor."
28-04-2018T16:26:35,Wyvern088,"we just need more steel codpieces for the dudes, to balance things out"
28-04-2018T16:26:50,Vatruvius,lol

28-04-2018T16:38:07,MadMaxton,You may not believe it but smuggling flour into the USA is something I would totally do if I ever had to go there for a longer period of time

28-04-2018T16:38:31,SpazztasticKiwi,We’ll see you next time on “How Stupid Were You When You Were Young?”

28-04-2018T16:39:13,ItsActuallyKopyKat,carrier pigeons!
28-04-2018T16:39:18,MadMaxton,because American bread can't compare to the stuff I know from my home country and you don't find the ingredients there either
28-04-2018T16:39:33,TheBeckoner,Like what?
28-04-2018T16:39:37,ThingsAreMoving,"Where you from, Mad"

28-04-2018T16:39:53,SpazztasticKiwi,American bread isn’t real bread. It’s made sweeter

28-04-2018T16:40:52,ThingsAreMoving,1/10 no effort
28-04-2018T16:40:54,MadMaxton,I heard from a friend who was in the USA that they have mostly white bread and no proper bread with full wheat and you can't buy full wheat there either
28-04-2018T16:40:59,SiliconCarbide,"speaking of bread, ill be going to the us soon, was surprised to find most hotels dont include breakfast? is that normal?"
28-04-2018T16:41:04,NightMeaty22,And the cop there almost shot me

28-04-2018T16:41:59,Mippy,Not from the States so I can't really comment on the state of the bread.
28-04-2018T16:42:02,ZephyrTWolffox,"They have plenty of good bread here, you just don't wanna buy the crap they have at Price Chopper"

28-04-2018T16:42:46,SpazztasticKiwi,Walmart bakery bread is pretty good
28-04-2018T16:42:52,unsteddyphoenix,I heard from a friend who was in the USA that people who buy whole grain bread are considered health freaks and shunned by local communities
28-04-2018T16:42:56,ThingsAreMoving,you lost me on walmart
28-04-2018T16:43:05,TerraTheWizard,hwut

28-04-2018T16:43:43,SpazztasticKiwi,The whole grain and stuff is really good
28-04-2018T16:43:46,unsteddyphoenix,I see

28-04-2018T16:44:05,unsteddyphoenix,I heard from a friend who was in the USA that americans fry their bread in bacon fat before they eat it
28-04-2018T16:44:08,MadMaxton,"Guess I should have fact checked before I spout nonsense, great now I look dumb"

28-04-2018T16:46:04,SpazztasticKiwi,There’s a few that fit the stereotypes you speak of. I’ve seen them and known one or two

28-04-2018T18:10:52,unsteddyphoenix,because hes a gamer and an artist
28-04-2018T18:10:55,RedDragonSyndicate,Looks like a Cintiq 24HD
28-04-2018T18:10:56,Xexanoth,below the stream
28-04-2018T18:11:00,Keeeef,Oh
28-04-2018T18:11:11,ThingsAreMoving,"The most perplexing Name I can think of is Dick. I mean, why would you name your child as a synonym of penis."
28-04-2018T18:11:19,Vatruvius,I would not say so from what I have heard.
28-04-2018T18:11:28,Vatruvius,Which is exclusively from this chat.
28-04-2018T18:11:32,RedDragonSyndicate,Which I've always wondered how much better the larger Cintiqs are. I have the 13HD.
28-04-2018T18:11:35,Middykins,The history of Dick is quite easy to explain
28-04-2018T18:11:37,SpazztasticKiwi,What’s he supposedly done
28-04-2018T18:11:37,Keeeef,Spotted Sick™
28-04-2018T18:11:43,ItsActuallyKopyKat,"Yeah, how do you get Dick from Richard??? (You ask nicely...or look good)"
28-04-2018T18:11:44,DannyBomb,"I can see description on mobile, and yeah a bit of gaming, I with my PC wasn't a potato but it handles few games :P"
28-04-2018T18:11:49,Vatruvius,However I am not attracted to guys so...
28-04-2018T18:11:52,Mippy,"Things, Dick is short for Richard"
28-04-2018T18:11:55,Middykins,It's a shortening of Richard
28-04-2018T18:11:57,Keeeef,At least you have a pc
28-04-2018T18:11:58,totallynotTrace,most Dicks are not named dick. their name is Richard
28-04-2018T18:12:03,DannyBomb,Can't *
28-04-2018T18:12:06,Keeeef,I use my moms computer
28-04-2018T18:12:07,Middykins,And from the start the shortening was Rick
28-04-2018T18:12:09,totallynotTrace,middy beat me to it
28-04-2018T18:12:10,ThingsAreMoving,How the eff you shorten a Richard to a Dick
28-04-2018T18:12:13,ThingsAreMoving,How
28-04-2018T18:12:15,Alphawolf333,It came from a old mispelling for Rick
28-04-2018T18:12:20,Mippy,For some reason
28-04-2018T18:12:22,Middykins,But it's easier to have a name start with a hard letter than a soft one
28-04-2018T18:12:23,Bgrmystr2,Rich is short for Richard. i feel bad for anyone getting it shortened to Dick
28-04-2018T18:12:26,Middykins,So it became Dick
28-04-2018T18:12:35,unsteddyphoenix,Just...dont call yourself dick
28-04-2018T18:12:35,Middykins,Just like how William become Bill
28-04-2018T18:12:38,ThingsAreMoving,Dick move
28-04-2018T18:12:42,Keeeef,Why are we talking about dick
28-04-2018T18:12:47,unsteddyphoenix,"Unless your name is legitimately dick, then youre boned"
28-04-2018T18:12:47,ThingsAreMoving,cause we can
28-04-2018T18:12:48,Alphawolf333,"And also people were generally more illiterate, so spelling was hard."
28-04-2018T18:13:04,Bgrmystr2,"lol, nothing changed then, alpha"
28-04-2018T18:13:06,Xexanoth,because Keith is getting painted *insert perverted joke her*
28-04-2018T18:13:14,Xexanoth,Here
28-04-2018T18:13:20,Mippy,Ummm...because Batman @Keeeef

28-04-2018T18:13:29,Middykins,Also I wish I had any amounts of paitence at all
28-04-2018T18:13:40,DannyBomb,"I didn't have a pic untill I was about 15, and thank goodness no one else in the family knows how to use one :ptv-kippi2:"
28-04-2018T18:13:43,Middykins,I have tried drawing way too many times

28-04-2018T18:13:59,Middykins,But every time I fail because I can't allow myself to spend more than 5 mins on a drawing
28-04-2018T18:14:02,SemiDemiGod,dont do that. no one likes that
28-04-2018T18:14:22,MuonNeutrino,"i missed the beginning of the stream; was there one before the clovis one, and what else got color-voted?"
28-04-2018T18:14:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"Vat, are you just saying Sanders isn’t good looking or that he’s done something disagreeable"
28-04-2018T18:14:25,Vatruvius,"Apparently from what my sister has seen/heard, some guys got sick of looking at all the ads for women push-up bras and padded underwear so they wanted a men line of ""enhanced"" looking clothing and came up with a pillow boxer for guys if you get what I mea"

28-04-2018T18:16:30,ThingsAreMoving,Kopy are you referencing Thanos?
28-04-2018T18:16:30,Xexanoth,i think he cut out Nat and the last Basitin

28-04-2018T18:55:45,Vatruvius,"Also, now we know why Tom is always stressed out. Never saves until end of stream."
28-04-2018T18:55:51,unsteddyphoenix,Hey lets not!
28-04-2018T18:56:08,BadFoMo,*Thray?
28-04-2018T18:56:17,PalmettoPathfinder1,Why?  From what I've heard the Darwin Awards are supposed to be funny.  Or so I've heard.
28-04-2018T18:56:17,ThingsAreMoving,"Darwin awards are gruesome, let's keep it pg13"
28-04-2018T18:56:31,ThingsAreMoving,"people die for those awards, you know"
28-04-2018T18:56:46,PalmettoPathfinder1,Okay I wasn't told that now.
28-04-2018T18:56:46,Vatruvius,How about people not die for awards?
28-04-2018T18:56:49,NightMeaty22,Pg13 is a lie
28-04-2018T18:56:57,Xexanoth,they dont always die
28-04-2018T18:56:58,Zakuru,shota bastians &lt;3
28-04-2018T18:57:00,ThingsAreMoving,are you aware what Darwin awards are about?
28-04-2018T18:57:03,unsteddyphoenix,Like...why would anyone want that. Sounds like an idea that a bot would autogenerate via keywords
28-04-2018T18:57:09,Xexanoth,it's either dead or unable to reproduce
28-04-2018T18:57:18,ThingsAreMoving,^
28-04-2018T18:57:22,Mippy,....wHAT Mvilu said
28-04-2018T18:57:27,ThingsAreMoving,but still either death or mutilation
28-04-2018T18:57:35,PalmettoPathfinder1,The Darwin Awards are like the Jackass tv series.
28-04-2018T18:57:42,unsteddyphoenix,Lets have RAINE AND KAREN do BACKFLIPS
28-04-2018T18:57:44,Xexanoth,except with more dead
28-04-2018T18:57:46,ThingsAreMoving,except they're not stunts

28-04-2018T18:58:10,unsteddyphoenix,"No, is joke."
28-04-2018T18:58:14,PalmettoPathfinder1,And I didn't say they would read them out loud.  They would just be looking at them and wondering who are these idiots.
28-04-2018T18:58:14,ThingsAreMoving,unsteddy tries generic ideas generator
28-04-2018T18:58:29,superwolfart,nice job

28-04-2018T18:58:31,unsteddyphoenix,I wonder how hard that would be to make...
28-04-2018T18:58:39,SemiDemiGod,back. what i miss?
28-04-2018T18:58:42,ThingsAreMoving,Not hard
28-04-2018T18:58:46,unsteddyphoenix,"No Marv, that's a 10/10 idea so it doesnt work here."
28-04-2018T18:58:47,Xexanoth,btw anyone else saw the Chapter Cover and thought that the Karen/Maddie pic was them playing a game very competetively and then Maeve just ends up winning because they ignore her?
28-04-2018T18:58:48,DRAGONTANOPUG,What were the 4th and 5th sketchs
28-04-2018T18:58:52,ThingsAreMoving,getting something worthwhile would be hard
28-04-2018T18:58:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,XD
28-04-2018T18:59:02,unsteddyphoenix,Im talkin' 'bout trash ideas no human would want

28-04-2018T18:59:41,unsteddyphoenix,See! What the hell is that?
28-04-2018T18:59:43,unsteddyphoenix,Are you real?
28-04-2018T18:59:47,ThingsAreMoving,Nora Cards are limited to Tom's art afaik
28-04-2018T18:59:49,Vatruvius,Nora Cards have to be approved by Tom I believe.
28-04-2018T18:59:55,PalmettoPathfinder1,For some reason I want to see Tom draw Jimmy Kimmel.

28-04-2018T20:04:36,ThingsAreMoving,I'd say trace
28-04-2018T20:04:41,SpazztasticKiwi,That depends on what they can do with their voice
28-04-2018T20:04:41,DRAGONTANOPUG,runs through glass
28-04-2018T20:04:42,BadFoMo,@DrakeSlayerJake You missed p0rn. #TotallyTheTruth
28-04-2018T20:04:43,unsteddyphoenix,Every character in the sketches seems to love trace
28-04-2018T20:05:01,Mippy,Keith...
28-04-2018T20:05:18,PhilTheIdle,Thats because Trace is cool.
28-04-2018T20:05:29,SpazztasticKiwi,If that voice is deep enough to rattle bones...:ptv-snicker:
28-04-2018T20:05:37,DRAGONTANOPUG,Or they want to be on his good side.
28-04-2018T20:05:38,unsteddyphoenix,You mean like daddys?
28-04-2018T20:05:41,Vexd,"Ah, the Squire gets the best view he'll probably ever have in his life"

28-04-2018T20:09:15,unsteddyphoenix,I feel like there was a more updated one
28-04-2018T20:09:15,Bgrmystr2,maybe 6?

28-04-2018T20:10:49,PalmettoPathfinder1,Well you can't argue with this fact: Adelaide and Natani make muscular women look sexy.

28-04-2018T20:11:02,Ordithus,&lt;3

28-04-2018T20:11:20,Bgrmystr2,They look sexy with or without muscles.
28-04-2018T20:11:21,ThingsAreMoving,Is Adelaide checking out Nat or is it my imagination?

28-04-2018T22:56:45,BadFoMo,@Ordithus Thank you. I couldn't be bothered to misspell that.

28-04-2018T23:36:19,unsteddyphoenix,it couldve been!
28-04-2018T23:36:37,Vatruvius,I originally was typing Kat but I had to catch myself. Took too long for me to think of the spelling of cat.

28-04-2018T23:37:29,SpazztasticKiwi,But he’s like a little fuzzy jellybean
28-04-2018T23:37:32,Vatruvius,Opal os good name.

28-04-2018T23:39:30,TheBeckoner,Also I couldn't get that link to work kiwi...sadme
28-04-2018T23:39:39,TheBeckoner,Pants?
28-04-2018T23:39:41,Bgrmystr2,Still fighting the power.
28-04-2018T23:39:44,TheBeckoner,not just underwear?
28-04-2018T23:39:47,Vatruvius,Death?
28-04-2018T23:39:49,unsteddyphoenix,Call him Sir Pouncealot
28-04-2018T23:39:53,SpazztasticKiwi,I’ll have to retweet the picture
28-04-2018T23:40:08,SpazztasticKiwi,And Death is because that’s what he’d be for Tom
28-04-2018T23:40:15,SpazztasticKiwi,Cause he’s allergic
28-04-2018T23:40:22,Bgrmystr2,xD

28-04-2018T23:40:42,SpazztasticKiwi,I don’t aim to keep him
28-04-2018T23:40:52,Bgrmystr2,"""Aww, who's my lil ball of death? You are, yes you are!"""
28-04-2018T23:41:11,SpazztasticKiwi,My hope is to find him a new home once I scope out a good home and he’s a little older
28-04-2018T23:41:31,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s likely gonna be Jellybean though
28-04-2018T23:41:41,Vatruvius,Very cute.
28-04-2018T23:41:48,Dadrobit,"Since he's being forced out of his home, you should call him Keith."

28-04-2018T23:42:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Now that’s cruel
28-04-2018T23:42:20,Dadrobit,More subtle than Death at least.
28-04-2018T23:42:21,unsteddyphoenix,I feel physically injured
28-04-2018T23:42:24,Vatruvius,"Midnight would be a good name too, but probably too common a name for black cats."
28-04-2018T23:42:26,unsteddyphoenix,You have to keep him now
28-04-2018T23:42:57,Dadrobit,Midnight too common? Call him Antinoon.
28-04-2018T23:42:59,SpazztasticKiwi,I took him in because he’s a baby and I know how to tend to tiny kittens
28-04-2018T23:43:18,SpazztasticKiwi,And I didn’t want him going into a shelter
28-04-2018T23:43:31,SpazztasticKiwi,Black cats don’t last there
28-04-2018T23:43:39,TheBeckoner,reasonable solution: Eat the cat.

28-04-2018T23:44:36,Bgrmystr2,What about Licorice
28-04-2018T23:44:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Another reason I’m not sure about keeping him is Bagheera hates him
28-04-2018T23:45:00,TheBeckoner,Ooh thats no good
28-04-2018T23:45:04,SpazztasticKiwi,He’s mad jealous

28-04-2018T23:45:50,SpazztasticKiwi,Now you’re getting ridiculous Tom
28-04-2018T23:45:55,Twokinds,You can add 420 to that if you're feeling fancy.

28-04-2018T23:47:54,unsteddyphoenix,Well you dont want it to be too long
28-04-2018T23:47:57,unsteddyphoenix,Otherwise it'd be a bit silly
28-04-2018T23:48:01,SpazztasticKiwi,Vat NO
28-04-2018T23:48:01,TheBeckoner,tru
28-04-2018T23:48:31,Bgrmystr2,"If tom is fixed, does that mean he won't be allergic to his cats anymore..?"
28-04-2018T23:48:43,Bgrmystr2,tom.exe repairs in progress :v
28-04-2018T23:49:03,Vatruvius,Don't think that's how that works. :thinking:
28-04-2018T23:49:12,Bgrmystr2,it does now.
28-04-2018T23:49:17,unsteddyphoenix,that would likely mean a large decline in boobs...
28-04-2018T23:49:19,unsteddyphoenix,unacceptable
28-04-2018T23:49:27,Bgrmystr2,would it though..?
28-04-2018T23:49:32,SpazztasticKiwi,This chat went downhill fast
28-04-2018T23:49:51,Vatruvius,Being fixed does not remove the desire for boobs.
28-04-2018T23:49:51,SpazztasticKiwi,Back to the kitten...
28-04-2018T23:50:10,Dadrobit,Flora would implode
28-04-2018T23:50:13,Bgrmystr2,"Kiwi, you are incorrectly under the assumption that the chat has anywhere downhill to go."
28-04-2018T23:50:22,SpazztasticKiwi,"Kiwi’s pretty tolerant of him, as are the other cats"
28-04-2018T23:50:23,Bgrmystr2,We are always down here.
28-04-2018T23:50:33,TheBeckoner,we are on a plain here.
28-04-2018T23:50:41,SpazztasticKiwi,But Bagheera...he becomes a sour grape
28-04-2018T23:50:46,unsteddyphoenix,its good to be tolerant of cats
28-04-2018T23:50:59,Vatruvius,We are always the bottom of the hill.
28-04-2018T23:51:16,unsteddyphoenix,Bagheera does not like XxDoomMare08xX because he is black :/
28-04-2018T23:51:29,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera is black too
28-04-2018T23:51:33,Bgrmystr2,:thinking:
28-04-2018T23:51:58,SpazztasticKiwi,I’m 99% sure it’s an attention thing
28-04-2018T23:52:02,unsteddyphoenix,Sad to see such rivalry
28-04-2018T23:52:13,Dadrobit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RINHjxsPOEg
28-04-2018T23:52:22,Vatruvius,Kittens require attention so I can see that.
28-04-2018T23:53:32,Bgrmystr2,rofl dadro relevant/10 :ok_hand:
28-04-2018T23:53:37,SpazztasticKiwi,"I’d see it as a territorial or hormonal thing if the kitten was older and Bagheera wasn’t fixed, but neither apply so it has to be just pure jealousy"
28-04-2018T23:54:02,TheBeckoner,lol Robit
28-04-2018T23:54:12,Bgrmystr2,"""These are MY HUMANS"" - cat probably"
28-04-2018T23:55:12,SpazztasticKiwi,The kitten has gone up and touched him though and Bagheera showed no aggression other than hissing
28-04-2018T23:55:47,Bgrmystr2,that cat needs to chill
28-04-2018T23:55:55,Bgrmystr2,seems like it has none
28-04-2018T23:56:13,SpazztasticKiwi,I really don’t need another cat though. I wasn’t even supposed to have Bagheera
28-04-2018T23:56:26,SpazztasticKiwi,Kiwi was the only planned cat
28-04-2018T23:56:52,Vatruvius,"That sounds like nothing but jealousy, the kitten is getting attention and tge other is not."
28-04-2018T23:57:18,Vatruvius,the*
28-04-2018T23:57:49,Vatruvius,"Refering to Bagheera, did not know how to spell their name."
28-04-2018T23:58:01,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s the spelling
28-04-2018T23:58:22,Vatruvius,Where does that name come from?
28-04-2018T23:58:39,SpazztasticKiwi,"Also, the kitten has a little white triangle under his neck, like he’s a tuxedo cat"
28-04-2018T23:59:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Bagheera comes from the Jungle Book. My mom named him since he was going to be hers once we realized we were gonna end up keeping him
28-04-2018T23:59:25,unsteddyphoenix,:ctwokinds-katdryer::ctwokinds-katdryer::ctwokinds-katdryer::ctwokinds-katdryer:
28-04-2018T23:59:55,SpazztasticKiwi,But he started preferring sitting with me and sleeping on my bed
