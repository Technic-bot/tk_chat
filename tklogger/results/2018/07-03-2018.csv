07-03-2018T03:18:48,Barabashe4ka,Hello everybody
07-03-2018T09:43:30,TheBeckoner,Welp I might be getting sick...
07-03-2018T09:43:35,TheBeckoner,this blows
07-03-2018T11:21:16,TorqueEmUp,Seems a lot of people are getting sick lately
07-03-2018T11:21:52,TorqueEmUp,People need to open their windows more in the winter.
07-03-2018T12:21:06,PhilTheIdle,And of course warm clothes make it even worse...
07-03-2018T12:29:55,TorqueEmUp,"No really, you need to air out your house/apartment"
07-03-2018T12:32:29,TorqueEmUp,Creates a breeding ground for disease if you go months with mostly the same air floating around.
07-03-2018T14:28:14,TheBeckoner,I open my window semi frequently though
07-03-2018T14:28:25,TheBeckoner,I probably got something from someone at the college.
07-03-2018T15:55:37,TorqueEmUp,"Man real bummed that we haven't seen the nibbly sketch colored yet. all the other got colored and posted, just not nibbly. :disappointed:"
07-03-2018T17:29:00,Bgrmystr2,"opening window during winter can also cause disease, FYI"
07-03-2018T17:29:05,Bgrmystr2,cuz the cold air
07-03-2018T17:29:30,Bgrmystr2,makes your body more susceptable to disease
07-03-2018T17:30:06,Bgrmystr2,"erh, susceptible* I guess"
07-03-2018T18:21:35,JaydenMozingo,Was there a Wednesday stream?
07-03-2018T18:22:32,BadFoMo,Nope.
07-03-2018T18:23:38,JaydenMozingo,Aww. What happened? Tom have family things or other?
07-03-2018T18:37:09,Bgrmystr2,He wasn't feeling well
07-03-2018T18:37:17,Bgrmystr2,from what we were told
07-03-2018T19:22:27,JaydenMozingo,Aww. Well rather he sees my message or not I hope he gets better
07-03-2018T19:22:55,JaydenMozingo,"""Sick day"" sketch is the first thing that came to my mind"
07-03-2018T19:57:01,SpazztasticKiwi,"Hot soup, tissues, and NyQuil await"
07-03-2018T19:57:21,SpazztasticKiwi,Unless itâ€™s the stomach virus
07-03-2018T20:50:38,Combak,Tom isn't around tonight either.
07-03-2018T21:19:08,unsteddyphoenix,Is the fact that he sick a rumour or do we actually know?
07-03-2018T21:22:32,TheFDdriver,hello
07-03-2018T21:33:08,TorqueEmUp,I don't think we actually know
07-03-2018T21:33:19,TorqueEmUp,but considering a lot of people are getting sick lately
07-03-2018T21:33:27,TorqueEmUp,I wouldn't doubt if he is.
07-03-2018T21:33:35,unsteddyphoenix,It does seem to happen to him a lot
07-03-2018T21:33:38,unsteddyphoenix,Poor dude
07-03-2018T21:33:41,Bgrmystr2,Someone was saying he said so in the IRC
07-03-2018T21:34:03,TorqueEmUp,IRC was deader then dead when I was in there last night
07-03-2018T21:34:24,TheBeckoner,He was on the IRC last night but I came in after he said that I think.
07-03-2018T21:34:31,TheBeckoner,Also sorta dead
07-03-2018T21:34:33,TheBeckoner,some car talk
07-03-2018T21:34:39,TheBeckoner,thats all tho
07-03-2018T21:34:57,TorqueEmUp,I sat there for an hour or two and not a single thing was said
07-03-2018T21:35:07,TheBeckoner,huh
07-03-2018T21:35:17,TheBeckoner,Is your window open still?
07-03-2018T21:35:28,TorqueEmUp,saw people come and go
07-03-2018T21:35:28,TheBeckoner,I have chat stuff in mine about aliens lol
07-03-2018T21:35:32,TorqueEmUp,Nah I closed out of it
07-03-2018T21:35:35,TheBeckoner,ah
07-03-2018T21:35:49,TorqueEmUp,Don't really care for the IRC
07-03-2018T21:36:06,unsteddyphoenix,Oh yeaaah that place
07-03-2018T21:36:20,unsteddyphoenix,That chat annoys me so much
07-03-2018T21:36:24,unsteddyphoenix,Barely functional for me
07-03-2018T21:36:24,Bgrmystr2,You were probably too late Torque
07-03-2018T21:36:25,TorqueEmUp,Rather have a official discord
07-03-2018T21:36:53,TorqueEmUp,Well of course
07-03-2018T21:36:54,Bgrmystr2,"By the time the chat was talking about the IRC, everything was already said and done, and likely gone from the chat history anyway"
07-03-2018T21:37:00,TorqueEmUp,I wouldn't have gone to the IRC otherwise
07-03-2018T21:37:11,TorqueEmUp,Indeed
07-03-2018T21:38:40,TorqueEmUp,Wish there was an official discord instead
07-03-2018T21:38:42,TorqueEmUp,:P
07-03-2018T21:39:02,TorqueEmUp,Otherwise I will just stick to fan servers
07-03-2018T21:39:10,NightMeaty22,Hello
07-03-2018T21:39:15,TorqueEmUp,Like TwoKinds Group Chat
07-03-2018T21:40:01,Bgrmystr2,"lol there's two discords, and an official one would be drama all the time cuz you'd need mods for it or it'd go south quick"
07-03-2018T21:40:16,unsteddyphoenix,The other ones also have mods
07-03-2018T21:40:41,unsteddyphoenix,A discord would be nice just 'cause everything would be recorded
07-03-2018T21:40:45,Bgrmystr2,"yeah, and if you mod the wrong people, it goes equally south, equally as quickly"
07-03-2018T21:40:48,unsteddyphoenix,So I can stalk with efficiency
07-03-2018T21:40:52,Bgrmystr2,lol
07-03-2018T21:40:53,Bgrmystr2,stalker
07-03-2018T21:41:06,unsteddyphoenix,Then just give me complete control and there'd be no problems?
07-03-2018T21:41:09,unsteddyphoenix,Doesnt seem hard.
07-03-2018T21:41:13,TorqueEmUp,"I dunno, TwoKinds Group Chat seems to be pretty well moderated"
07-03-2018T21:41:33,Bgrmystr2,Prolly cuz you haven't paid attention to what all happens xD
07-03-2018T21:41:43,Bgrmystr2,"also yeah phoenix, you'd just ban everyone but you and tom"
07-03-2018T21:41:46,Bgrmystr2,"prob solved, right?"
07-03-2018T21:41:48,Bgrmystr2,:V
07-03-2018T21:42:50,TorqueEmUp,Put Sage in there
07-03-2018T21:42:56,TorqueEmUp,lol
07-03-2018T21:43:05,TorqueEmUp,as a mod
07-03-2018T21:43:07,Bgrmystr2,yeah cuz that goes so well on Fri XD
07-03-2018T21:43:15,TorqueEmUp,XP
07-03-2018T21:43:24,unsteddyphoenix,Technically that would work bgr...
07-03-2018T21:43:38,unsteddyphoenix,But then who would be the touhou expert
07-03-2018T21:43:51,unsteddyphoenix,We'd be woefully unprepared for Touhou based emergencies
07-03-2018T21:44:14,Bgrmystr2,:ptv-excited: I mean.. I don't know who you could possibly have on staff to deal with such dangerous incidents.
07-03-2018T21:45:09,unsteddyphoenix,I would have to take some resumes and CVs
07-03-2018T21:46:37,Bgrmystr2,lol CVs?
07-03-2018T21:47:06,Bgrmystr2,Construction Vehicles.
07-03-2018T21:47:12,Bgrmystr2,May or may not have some of those..
07-03-2018T21:48:44,unsteddyphoenix,Curriculum Vitae
07-03-2018T21:48:52,unsteddyphoenix,Thought the other thing you said would also work
07-03-2018T21:49:08,Bgrmystr2,xD
07-03-2018T21:49:43,Bgrmystr2,never heard of CV before now
07-03-2018T21:49:56,Bgrmystr2,interesting :thinking:
