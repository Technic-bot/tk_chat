01-03-2018T20:45:46,MarvTheHugPharaoh,nani?
01-03-2018T20:46:21,BluePhantom90,which Blue?
01-03-2018T20:46:41,MarvTheHugPharaoh,was just saying I like the color blue unknown picked
01-03-2018T20:59:14,Chippotatothefirst,... the everlasting headache of a concussion
01-03-2018T20:59:58,Chippotatothefirst,I don’t care what the doctor says I’m still going to watch the stream
01-03-2018T21:00:36,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I would suggest listening to your doctor
01-03-2018T21:02:07,Chippotatothefirst,"It’s fine, I don’t think much damage can come from this"
01-03-2018T21:02:32,CrRAR,I just thought concussion victims were supposed to be watched for extended bouts of sleep.
01-03-2018T21:03:55,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"yeah sleeping right after a head injury is not the best, not sure why tho"
01-03-2018T21:04:23,Chippotatothefirst,"Nope, apparently you can’t do sports go on a device and things like that"
01-03-2018T21:05:11,MarvTheHugPharaoh,could be stimulating parts of the brain that might need the time to heal first
01-03-2018T21:05:47,MarvTheHugPharaoh,I'm not a doctor or all the smart with this type of stuff so just speculating
01-03-2018T21:06:06,Chippotatothefirst,Well if you sleep right after a head injury it makes it more likely to slip into a coma
01-03-2018T21:06:13,MarvTheHugPharaoh,Eek

01-03-2018T21:27:26,Nekonny,Emote movie maker
01-03-2018T21:27:29,Nekonny,its faster
01-03-2018T21:27:31,Tharkis,"this house was last roofed in 1992, and an asphault roof usually lasts an average of 30 years"
01-03-2018T21:27:38,Nekonny,when the final product isn't as important
01-03-2018T21:27:42,Tharkis,so it's getting up there in age at 26

01-03-2018T21:29:19,SpazztasticKiwi,That’s a little over half my height
01-03-2018T21:29:33,CrRAR,"Do not ask for whom the tide rolls, the tide rolls for thee~"
01-03-2018T21:29:46,FoxxTrotter,Alabama. :0)
01-03-2018T21:29:46,Tharkis,yeah boston's under water atm
01-03-2018T21:29:51,CrRAR,wheee
01-03-2018T21:30:14,FoxxTrotter,"Yes, Tharkis, I heard on the news earlier."
01-03-2018T21:30:47,CrRAR,Sadly a tree crushed a Jeep nearby here.
01-03-2018T21:30:57,CrRAR,beep beep mourn the jeep~
01-03-2018T21:31:00,SpazztasticKiwi,Aren’t they supposed to be having cold weather this time of year
01-03-2018T21:31:19,SageSaga,"so every time i watch a new episode of Overlord im like ""I really love where this is- oh- the episode is over, man how do they make 20 minutes feel like 5 minutes?"""
01-03-2018T21:31:23,FoxxTrotter,I also heard they're having a major storm in the British Isles and Ireland as well.
01-03-2018T21:31:28,CrRAR,"yeah, like 5 degrees colder woulda been a blizzard"
01-03-2018T21:31:40,SpazztasticKiwi,It’s always raining in Ireland
01-03-2018T21:31:48,FoxxTrotter,"No, SNOW."
01-03-2018T21:31:53,CrRAR,a wicked blizzah dooood
01-03-2018T21:31:54,Tharkis,"hah yeah, the best anime are always like that.   But man, Sebas is badass =D  I really like him even more after the last episode"
01-03-2018T21:31:57,FoxxTrotter,They have a blizzard over there.
01-03-2018T21:32:16,Rosscoe,"I got brownsih gree ngrass, and mroe rain"
01-03-2018T21:32:26,NezumiYuki,"Mega Snow Snow in Ireland, yeah I think I saw that in the news!"
01-03-2018T21:32:28,Tharkis,i keep wondering though if Sebas is named after Sebastian from black butler
01-03-2018T21:32:29,CrRAR,mmm
01-03-2018T21:32:49,Tharkis,Black butler was hugely popular when Overlord was being written originally
01-03-2018T21:33:09,CrRAR,oh Tom is director guy
01-03-2018T21:33:09,SageSaga,i know hes not human but like- i think he is supposed to be some kinda dragonkin?
01-03-2018T21:33:21,SageSaga,but i think they only mentioned it once
01-03-2018T21:33:48,NezumiYuki,"My favorite Tom cameo, was the pizza delivery guy early in the comic.  xDDD"
01-03-2018T21:34:00,CrRAR,mmmmhmmm
01-03-2018T21:34:11,BadFoMo,Nora?
01-03-2018T21:34:15,Tharkis,"hrm, i dont think they atually say what he is other than 'head butler"""
01-03-2018T21:34:16,CrRAR,reni
01-03-2018T21:34:28,BadFoMo,Yep.
01-03-2018T21:34:29,SageSaga,are you sure?
01-03-2018T21:34:34,CrRAR,dem horns don lie~
01-03-2018T21:34:36,Whitestripes,Tom should have another cameo
01-03-2018T21:34:43,FoxxTrotter,@aeoronwah Sage has been getting up with you.
01-03-2018T21:34:55,Tharkis,even in the light novels i dont think he's ever referred to as anything than the head butler and the wiki lists him as Heteromorphic Race
01-03-2018T21:34:55,NezumiYuki,MOAR Pizza... Tommy... We need more pizza!
01-03-2018T21:35:08,Bgrmystr2,"there's a few cameos like that, Nezumi"
01-03-2018T21:35:16,Nekonny,"ok, I think wough is good"
01-03-2018T21:35:18,CrRAR,No situation cannot be improved by pizza
01-03-2018T21:35:21,Nekonny,*rough
01-03-2018T21:35:28,Tharkis,"while he's just a the head butler, his power rivals that of the floor bosses though...."
01-03-2018T21:35:33,Tharkis,if anime teaches you one thing
01-03-2018T21:35:36,Nekonny,can pizza be improved by pizza?
01-03-2018T21:35:38,Tharkis,dont mess with maids and butlers !
01-03-2018T21:35:38,Rosscoe,"Well I cant wait for Wednesday, Taking a slow train to Ontario, reason its slo it takes 20 hours fro mTruro t omonteral, like how? :P"
01-03-2018T21:35:45,SageSaga,i thought while they were on the carriage in season 1 they said draconian or dragon-somthing
01-03-2018T21:36:01,SageSaga,"maybe it was the manga but it was ""season 1"""
01-03-2018T21:36:05,NezumiYuki,"Yes Nekos!  Pizza on pizza can improve your pizza, so I put pizza on yer pizza!"
01-03-2018T21:36:14,BadFoMo,@Nekonny Maybe with Pineapples?

01-03-2018T21:37:19,Tharkis,"I'll have to look back, sebas is one of my favorite chars in Overlord"
01-03-2018T21:37:47,Tharkis,having a maid character myself i've got a soft spot for Sebas and the Pleiades

01-03-2018T22:38:23,Bgrmystr2,Nibbly wouldn't be in it Zro. She'd be DLC
01-03-2018T22:38:23,SageSaga,uhm- so Konami has never made a good game?
01-03-2018T22:38:35,ZRO4825,"Precisely my point, Bgr. o_o"
01-03-2018T22:38:40,ZRO4825,"Oh, Konami used to make good games too."
01-03-2018T22:38:49,Bgrmystr2,so did EA though
01-03-2018T22:38:52,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"they have, they made many. but they would rather make pachinco machines today"

01-03-2018T23:23:18,Bgrmystr2,@Alphawolf333 You can sometimes see the producers taking part of their own movie as background characters. It's fairly common.
01-03-2018T23:23:58,Zakuru,Stan lee

01-03-2018T23:24:04,Bgrmystr2,Yeah Stan does it a LOT
01-03-2018T23:24:11,Bgrmystr2,he's one of the best examples

01-03-2018T23:24:39,Combak,"Also, Hitchcock."
01-03-2018T23:24:40,SageSaga,Stan Lee has practically nothing to do with the movies
01-03-2018T23:24:48,SageSaga,so hes not a good example
01-03-2018T23:24:51,CrRAR,mmm

01-03-2018T23:36:41,Bgrmystr2,No he didn't
01-03-2018T23:36:44,MarvTheHugPharaoh,the yoga ball gif is from Maty I think
01-03-2018T23:36:46,Bgrmystr2,"Maty made that one, Mel"
01-03-2018T23:37:00,Melnekir,Oh nvm then
01-03-2018T23:37:08,Bgrmystr2,and it's unlikely to be the same program
01-03-2018T23:37:12,Melnekir,the animation style looks pretty different
01-03-2018T23:37:20,Bgrmystr2,yeh exactly
01-03-2018T23:37:22,SageSaga,its hand drawn animation
01-03-2018T23:37:27,Bgrmystr2,"there ya go, that'"
01-03-2018T23:37:28,Melnekir,so I was wondering about that
01-03-2018T23:37:30,Bgrmystr2,that's why
01-03-2018T23:37:36,NezumiYuki,afk for a moment again... need another mini pizza
01-03-2018T23:37:37,MarvTheHugPharaoh,BOUCE!!!!:ctwokinds-florajiggle:
01-03-2018T23:37:40,Nekonny,I'm working on http://pmp.katbox.net/
01-03-2018T23:37:44,Bgrmystr2,missing an N marv :P
01-03-2018T23:37:45,NezumiYuki,Nib Bounce Go!
01-03-2018T23:37:47,Melnekir,the bounce feels more natural and less Flash like
01-03-2018T23:37:52,Melnekir,if that makes any sense
01-03-2018T23:37:54,Nekonny,the animation was done in emofuri
01-03-2018T23:37:56,MarvTheHugPharaoh,panic type BGr
01-03-2018T23:37:57,CrimsonHelsing,"I didn't get a chance to see it all, damn game took so long syncing that it slowed down the feed to a stutter"
01-03-2018T23:38:08,CrimsonHelsing,*see the animation I mean
01-03-2018T23:38:08,Tharkis,PMP is cute and witty and more people should read it !
01-03-2018T23:38:16,Nekonny,I think Maty used clip studio for the animagion on sages stream
01-03-2018T23:38:22,Tharkis,if your'e really nice rosie will give you a glass of water
01-03-2018T23:38:39,Nekonny,thanks tharkis XD
01-03-2018T23:39:23,Melnekir,I tried reading PmP but I can't really get into the humor :disappointed_relieved:
01-03-2018T23:40:09,Nekonny,"guess its not for everyone? ^_^ """
01-03-2018T23:40:21,MrAMP,Clip sudio is a hit an dmiss.
01-03-2018T23:40:21,CrRAR,awww
01-03-2018T23:40:27,MrAMP,"Also, Jess is not amused."
01-03-2018T23:40:32,Melnekir,Yeah I guess I am not within the target audience
01-03-2018T23:41:03,Melnekir,I think  it is meant to be a comic for children?
01-03-2018T23:41:10,Ordithus,Is... is that Tom I see?
01-03-2018T23:41:18,Nekonny,not really&gt;?
01-03-2018T23:41:32,Zakuru,is that a tiny tom?
01-03-2018T23:42:12,Bgrmystr2,I don't think Tiny
01-03-2018T23:42:16,Bgrmystr2,just.. in the background.
01-03-2018T23:42:25,MarvTheHugPharaoh,he smol boi
01-03-2018T23:42:30,Tharkis,"it's 4koma style humor, no real 'story' , which imo ismore diffucilt to do as a webcomic than a normal web coimic.  gota keep coming up with unique ideas every strip.  I like PMP =P"
01-03-2018T23:42:55,NezumiYuki,Back for a moment~  Why's Clip Studio a hit or miss?   What'd I miss out on that convo?
01-03-2018T23:43:38,Bgrmystr2,"Oh, Harry Potter music now, Ron?"
01-03-2018T23:44:01,ZRO4825,Alrighty...now to go play with this damned electric lion-faced unicorn again...
01-03-2018T23:44:19,BadFoMo,...What?
01-03-2018T23:44:22,CrRAR,neato
01-03-2018T23:44:26,ZRO4825,"Monster Hunter, lol"
01-03-2018T23:45:02,BadFoMo,"Oh... Somehow, I saw that as the ancer."
01-03-2018T23:45:10,NezumiYuki,"BTW Sage, I love how ""ample"" this girl is"
01-03-2018T23:45:17,ZRO4825,Kaylin! :3
01-03-2018T23:45:56,Ordithus,"Do you read AI, Yuki?"
01-03-2018T23:46:15,NezumiYuki,Hmm sorry no
01-03-2018T23:46:23,NezumiYuki,*runs off to goog this
01-03-2018T23:46:27,ZRO4825,Ya should. :)
01-03-2018T23:46:30,Ordithus,ai.katbox.net
01-03-2018T23:46:37,NezumiYuki,Ah thanks Ord
01-03-2018T23:47:14,Ordithus,You're welcome! :ctwokinds-rainehappy:
01-03-2018T23:49:00,ItsActuallyKopyKat,I found it through Tom's links
01-03-2018T23:49:02,BadFoMo,"Also, what Tom's drawing reminds me of that one Angry Kid episode where he was doing the Queen's Speech to the nation."
01-03-2018T23:49:43,SpazztasticKiwi,"So if the comic’s just a live picturebook, where the hell is Tom storing these dragons?"
01-03-2018T23:50:05,Nekonny,in dragon storage
01-03-2018T23:50:05,Kyslyrn,In the garage like a normal person
01-03-2018T23:50:09,ItsActuallyKopyKat,In Reni's bags?
01-03-2018T23:50:17,Nekonny,aka garage
01-03-2018T23:50:30,ItsActuallyKopyKat,sure. garage.
01-03-2018T23:50:34,BadFoMo,They're just Jim Henson Puppets?
01-03-2018T23:50:42,SpazztasticKiwi,Then where does the car go?
01-03-2018T23:50:51,Kyslyrn,The other garage.
01-03-2018T23:50:54,Bgrmystr2,You guys don't remember when that one dragon turned into a cat?
01-03-2018T23:50:55,Bgrmystr2,jeez
01-03-2018T23:50:56,Kyslyrn,Or that shed out back

01-03-2018T23:51:02,BadFoMo,The driveway.
01-03-2018T23:51:06,Bgrmystr2,it's like you guys don't pay attention when tom says his cat never leaves his room :P
01-03-2018T23:51:06,MrAMP,The Dragon Garage is actually a name of a bar.
01-03-2018T23:51:07,Twokinds,The dragons are brought in by trained dragon handlers and the talking is added in post production
01-03-2018T23:51:26,Twokinds,They CGI the expressions
01-03-2018T23:51:30,Ordithus,:ctwokinds-reniderp:
01-03-2018T23:51:30,Nekonny,not all cg?
01-03-2018T23:51:36,NezumiYuki,XDDD Good one Tom!
01-03-2018T23:51:41,SpazztasticKiwi,Sure
01-03-2018T23:52:00,Nekonny,"Next up: AirBud, Twokinds Directors Cut"
01-03-2018T23:52:18,Tharkis,o_O
01-03-2018T23:52:30,MarvTheHugPharaoh,"Littlest hobo, TK Version"
01-03-2018T23:52:40,NezumiYuki,Nahhhhhhhhh Nekos... Next up would be~  How to tame your Reni!
01-03-2018T23:52:49,SpazztasticKiwi,I’d like to meet the group of people responsible for smuggling in life dragons in and out of movie sets
01-03-2018T23:53:01,Kyslyrn,So truckers?
01-03-2018T23:53:13,Nekonny,Jim Henson
01-03-2018T23:53:14,ZRO4825,XD
01-03-2018T23:53:38,Kyslyrn,Stuff 'em into a container and pay some random dude to haul it.
01-03-2018T23:53:41,SpazztasticKiwi,"I know there’s some unobservant people out there, but come on"
01-03-2018T23:54:42,SpazztasticKiwi,And where’d you find dragon handlers? I thought you were an indoor person
01-03-2018T23:55:23,SpazztasticKiwi,"I know, you bumped into them at Walmart grocery shopping"
01-03-2018T23:56:04,Bgrmystr2,there's this thing called the internet Kiwi
01-03-2018T23:56:06,Kyslyrn,How does that conversation go?
01-03-2018T23:56:07,Bgrmystr2,I suggest checking it out
01-03-2018T23:56:14,Bgrmystr2,you don't need to leave your home to find people.
01-03-2018T23:56:19,Bgrmystr2,It's amazing.
01-03-2018T23:56:31,Bgrmystr2,:V
01-03-2018T23:56:41,Kyslyrn,But then I can't get that lovely diesel exhaust smell
01-03-2018T23:56:51,Bgrmystr2,That's even more good news.
01-03-2018T23:56:52,NezumiYuki,Just be careful of the naughty side to the interwebz  xD
01-03-2018T23:57:09,SpazztasticKiwi,Sure you find people. But to happen to find likely the only dragon handlers ever?
01-03-2018T23:57:09,Bgrmystr2,Tom is only looking for dragon handlers. What could possibly go wrong?
01-03-2018T23:57:27,BadFoMo,@NezumiYuki Isn't that all of it?
01-03-2018T23:57:27,Kyslyrn,Everything.
01-03-2018T23:57:40,Bgrmystr2,"that's cuz you did it wrong, Ksy :P"

01-03-2018T23:58:31,Kyslyrn,Can't you tell? I hate vowels.
01-03-2018T23:58:47,NezumiYuki,"Pat, I'll by an I for 400"
01-03-2018T23:58:50,Bgrmystr2,the only thing that your name looks like is KissLearn
01-03-2018T23:58:51,Bgrmystr2,xD
01-03-2018T23:58:58,SpazztasticKiwi,Just smash your face on your keyboard. That’s your alien name
01-03-2018T23:59:20,Kyslyrn,"Ok, now I need to clean some blood."
